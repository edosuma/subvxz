peace, love and rock and roll.

01:26.131 --> 01:28.199
Spying?

01:28.266 --> 01:29.535
No, reporting.

01:29.568 --> 01:32.137
You're Nora Ephron from Wellesley.

01:32.203 --> 01:34.405
We met at the Mid-Atlantic debate finals.

01:34.540 --> 01:35.807
You exceeded your grace time.

01:37.776 --> 01:39.244
Good, you're both here.

01:39.310 --> 01:41.112
Two newbies, one spiel.

01:41.179 --> 01:42.548
Get in here.

01:43.281 --> 01:45.250
Have a seat.

01:45.316 --> 01:46.852
"News of the Week"...

01:46.918 --> 01:49.054
is the first draft of history each week.

01:49.120 --> 01:50.421
Your job is to be fast,

01:50.556 --> 01:51.690
and first and good and right.

01:51.757 --> 01:52.991
That's all we ask.

01:53.058 --> 01:54.660
Just don't write long first drafts, Nora.

01:54.726 --> 01:56.094
This isn't debate.

01:56.161 --> 01:58.329
I beat him at debate.

01:58.396 --> 01:59.798
You two should join forces.

01:59.865 --> 02:01.432
I'm assigning you two to be a writing team.

02:01.567 --> 02:03.268
Uh, Patti Robinson's gonna take you around.

02:03.334 --> 02:04.570
She's got long...

02:16.114 --> 02:18.283
Oh. Ahh.

02:25.624 --> 02:27.125
Oh, God.

02:27.192 --> 02:29.027
When I came back on Monday,

02:29.094 --> 02:31.963
and they told me that you
had just left for Paris,

02:32.030 --> 02:33.464
I cracked up.

02:33.599 --> 02:36.401
Our timing worked out today.

02:36.467 --> 02:38.670
Damnit, I forgot...

02:38.737 --> 02:41.172
Hey. Don't worry about it.

02:41.239 --> 02:43.441
I'm on the Pill now.

02:44.509 --> 02:46.011
- Hey.
- Uh-huh?

02:46.077 --> 02:49.480
Um, is it true what you
wrote in your letter?

02:49.615 --> 02:51.149
Did you really go to an orgy down there?

02:51.216 --> 02:52.718
Oh, they're not orgies.

02:52.784 --> 02:54.152
They're love-ins.

02:54.219 --> 02:57.623
It's not about sex, it's about love.

02:57.656 --> 03:00.626
You know, I brought you
back a snow globe from Paris,

03:00.692 --> 03:02.628
you know, for being such a good researcher.

03:02.661 --> 03:04.630
Oh, well...

03:04.663 --> 03:06.231
I brought you back two.

03:06.297 --> 03:10.101
For being such a good reporter.

03:11.637 --> 03:13.939
Patti, get up here! Get your girl.

03:14.005 --> 03:16.107
Where's Patti? Finn wants her.

03:18.944 --> 03:20.545
Patti, Finn wants you.

03:20.646 --> 03:22.280
Patti, Finn wants you.

03:22.347 --> 03:24.215
Oh, did you hear that?

03:24.282 --> 03:26.017
- Finn wants me.
- What?

03:28.654 --> 03:31.289
Finn!

03:31.356 --> 03:33.024
Finn, we got a story here.

03:33.091 --> 03:36.662
That might require
professional journalists.

03:36.728 --> 03:38.830
Holy shit, that's Wick.
Something's breaking.

03:40.065 --> 03:42.233
You're right.

03:42.300 --> 03:45.536
UPI's got three dead in
riot at a music festival

03:45.671 --> 03:46.672
in northern California.

03:46.672 --> 03:48.439
A place called Altamont.

03:48.506 --> 03:52.277
UPI coded "bulletin."
Reuters coded "alert."

03:52.343 --> 03:54.179
- What have we got?
- It's developing.

03:54.245 --> 03:56.682
I want you guys to sharpen your pencils.

03:56.715 --> 03:58.083
- IDs on the victims?
- Not yet.

03:58.149 --> 03:59.685
Nothin' on the injured, either.

03:59.751 --> 04:02.220
Crowd estimates are up
to tens of thousands.

04:02.287 --> 04:03.321
Hundreds of thousands.

04:03.388 --> 04:04.990
For Santana, the Jefferson Airplane,

04:05.056 --> 04:06.491
Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young,

04:06.557 --> 04:08.226
and the Grateful Dead.
They were scheduled to play

04:08.293 --> 04:09.995
until the Rolling Stones came on at sunset.

04:10.061 --> 04:12.230
Nice of you to stop by. Anything else?

04:12.297 --> 04:15.233
Um, it was originally
scheduled for Golden Gate Park,

04:15.300 --> 04:16.802
but then they moved it at the last minute,

04:16.868 --> 04:18.904
and, um, Mick made it free.

04:18.970 --> 04:21.005
The festival was billed as Woodstock West.

04:21.072 --> 04:24.542
Well, shit just went sideways
at Woodstock West, everybody.

04:24.609 --> 04:25.877
Where's Jane? Jane!

04:25.944 --> 04:27.345
Finn, you sent me to Woodstock.

04:27.412 --> 04:28.847
Patti's back from six
months in San Francisco,

04:28.914 --> 04:30.448
she's got a Rolodex of contacts.

04:30.515 --> 04:32.951
I know Santana's PR girl.
Maybe she has some leads.

04:33.018 --> 04:34.119
I'm here. What's happening?

04:34.185 --> 04:35.721
Anyone else besides Patti

04:35.754 --> 04:37.488
who even knew this concert was happening?

04:37.555 --> 04:38.757
Were the victims connected?

04:38.824 --> 04:40.458
Was this a crime spree or a stampede?

04:40.525 --> 04:42.928
Uh, I'll coordinate the files
coming in, and delegate research.

04:42.994 --> 04:44.996
Who's accountable? We'll get
it all nailed down better.

04:45.063 --> 04:46.732
If this was, in fact, a riot,

04:46.732 --> 04:49.167
it could have national and social
significance. Sam, get started.

04:49.234 --> 04:50.501
- Wait.
- What?

04:50.568 --> 04:52.470
Sam's written top flight
covers four weeks in a row,

04:52.537 --> 04:53.538
and he and Jane are a good team.

04:53.604 --> 04:55.106
Patti is sourced, I'm fresh.

04:55.173 --> 04:57.142
- Sam is tired from a month...
- What I need right now

04:57.208 --> 04:58.609
is the fastest re-write
man in the building,

04:58.744 --> 05:01.246
and his efficient researcher.

05:01.312 --> 05:03.749
I can't take a chance in
case this merits a cover.

05:03.782 --> 05:04.816
- Cover?
- We'll talk about that.

05:04.883 --> 05:06.351
- Sam.
- I need a minute, boss.

05:08.153 --> 05:10.188
- That's not fair.
- Yeah.

05:10.255 --> 05:13.558
Peace and love are back in California.

05:13.624 --> 05:16.361
Besides, now we got a free night.

05:16.427 --> 05:17.763
Let's finish what we started.

05:17.763 --> 05:20.031
We can't give up on this story yet.

05:20.098 --> 05:22.367
Sam is Finn's golden boy.

05:22.433 --> 05:24.169
Whatever Finn says goes,
it's non-negotiable.

05:24.235 --> 05:25.804
All right, I need a
honey to go up to photo,

05:25.871 --> 05:26.938
and give Ned a heads up.

05:27.005 --> 05:28.173
I'll do it.

05:31.509 --> 05:32.778
- Are you Patti?
- Yeah.

05:32.844 --> 05:34.379
Finn said you'd show me the pit.

05:34.445 --> 05:35.546
- Okay.
- I'm Nora.

05:35.613 --> 05:36.681
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:36.782 --> 05:38.083
Why didn't you get that story?

05:38.149 --> 05:40.185
Because Finn picked Sam
and Sam and Jane are a team.

05:41.787 --> 05:46.691
Okay, due diligence mandates we
cover a party that got out of hand

05:46.792 --> 05:50.061
while we already got a critical
story in Vietnam ready to go.

05:50.128 --> 05:51.797
All right, I want to graphic

05:51.797 --> 05:53.932
on the links between LSD and violence.

05:53.999 --> 05:55.934
Charles Manson was indicted yesterday.

05:56.001 --> 05:57.368
Manson box, how much, Stuart?

05:57.435 --> 05:58.904
As long as we're opening
up the whole magazine,

05:58.970 --> 06:00.305
I'd say 500 words.

06:00.371 --> 06:03.975
Okay, gin up a short on
the court proceedings.

06:04.042 --> 06:06.011
How was "the great asparagus"?

06:06.077 --> 06:07.478
He's already finished one book,

06:07.545 --> 06:09.347
and he's only been retired for six months.

06:09.414 --> 06:11.016
Damnit, arrogant fuck.

06:11.082 --> 06:13.551
He'd be speaking German
right now if it wasn't for us.

06:13.618 --> 06:15.153
Wick, let's head to photo.

06:15.220 --> 06:16.554
All right, get on that.

06:16.621 --> 06:17.555
Who's "the great asparagus"?

06:17.622 --> 06:19.457
Charles de Gaulle.

06:19.524 --> 06:22.393
Hey, you saved me from killing
Wick's cover story on Vietnam.

06:27.032 --> 06:29.367
They're reporters, we're researchers.

06:29.434 --> 06:33.038
We report, investigate, and
write files for the reporters,

06:33.104 --> 06:35.874
they do a pass on them,
put their names on them,

06:35.941 --> 06:37.943
and then the stories go to press.

06:38.009 --> 06:40.045
Nedders, stuff's breaking.

06:40.111 --> 06:41.379
Your cover's fate hangs in the balance.

06:41.446 --> 06:42.914
Yeah, of course it does,

06:42.981 --> 06:44.983
because it's done early
and perfectly composed.

06:45.050 --> 06:47.953
Altamont Music Festival in
northern California went haywire

06:48.019 --> 06:49.687
and people were killed. It's coming in now.

06:49.754 --> 06:50.721
What?

06:50.856 --> 06:52.023
Ned, any images yet?

06:52.090 --> 06:54.092
Well, we didn't staff the festival.

06:54.159 --> 06:56.227
Well, but the wires did, let's see.

06:56.294 --> 06:57.262
Here.

06:58.930 --> 07:01.867
That's all the east coast
papers can run with tonight.

07:01.867 --> 07:03.134
It's shit.

07:03.201 --> 07:06.671
We have, what, 45 hours
to get you a better shot

07:06.737 --> 07:08.039
to compose and design?

07:08.106 --> 07:09.975
Yeah. Us and "Rolling Stone."

07:10.041 --> 07:11.242
Wick, what do you think?

07:11.309 --> 07:12.777
Not my kind of story, boss.

07:12.878 --> 07:14.913
Well, it might have to be.
We got three people dead.

07:14.980 --> 07:16.882
Look, if Altamont peters out,

07:16.882 --> 07:18.884
Wick's cover on 'Nam is set.

07:18.917 --> 07:21.419
Wick, a word.

07:21.486 --> 07:23.254
We're going head to
head with "Rolling Stone"

07:23.321 --> 07:25.090
on a cover that Jan
would sell his sister for.

07:25.156 --> 07:26.691
That is a music magazine.

07:26.757 --> 07:29.094
"News of the Week" competes
with "Time Magazine."

07:29.160 --> 07:30.728
Everyone younger than you
and me reads "Rolling Stone."

07:30.795 --> 07:32.530
Yeah, well, youth is wasted on the young.

07:32.597 --> 07:34.799
- It's not that bad.
- It's getting there.

07:34.900 --> 07:36.567
Cindy, this is Nora, the new girl.

07:36.634 --> 07:37.735
- Oh.
- Nora Ephron.

07:37.802 --> 07:39.104
Hi.

07:39.170 --> 07:40.571
Cindy likes to hide out back here

07:40.638 --> 07:42.207
ostensibly writing captions.

07:42.273 --> 07:45.911
Mm-hmm. So, who got Altamont?

07:45.944 --> 07:47.245
Sam and Jane.

07:47.312 --> 07:49.480
Another one. What does she need?

07:49.547 --> 07:50.781
We'll find out.

07:50.916 --> 07:53.184
Doug wants to take me to
the Rothko retrospective,

07:53.251 --> 07:55.086
at the Guggenheim tomorrow night.

07:55.153 --> 07:57.188
Do I have to wear a tiara?

07:57.255 --> 07:58.223
Yes.

07:59.224 --> 08:00.926
I mean, no.

08:00.959 --> 08:03.194
But something fabulously chic.

08:03.261 --> 08:06.998
Oh, gloves. You must wear
beautiful calfskin gloves.

08:07.065 --> 08:08.833
Saks has the best gloves.

08:08.934 --> 08:12.137
Also, there's a salon on 86th and
Columbus that's open on Sundays.

08:14.940 --> 08:16.441
Anyway,

08:16.507 --> 08:18.977
- can Nora use your desk?
- Oh, sure.

08:19.945 --> 08:21.046
All that's left to do now

08:21.112 --> 08:22.948
is to make yourself indispensable.

08:29.687 --> 08:30.989
Can you do cop calls?

08:31.056 --> 08:33.224
Oh, I wish I could. I don't have time.

08:33.291 --> 08:34.859
I have a source that could be valuable.

08:34.960 --> 08:35.961
Then give 'em to me.

08:36.027 --> 08:38.229
It's the PR girl for Santana.

08:38.296 --> 08:39.965
She knows everyone who was at that show.

08:39.998 --> 08:41.198
Fantastic. What's her number?

08:41.265 --> 08:42.567
She's only going to talk to me.

08:46.437 --> 08:49.374
Okay, look, I know you were the
more natural fit for this story,

08:49.440 --> 08:51.476
but there's nothing I can do.

08:51.542 --> 08:53.044
Don't sabotage the story.

08:53.111 --> 08:55.180
I'm trying to help.

08:55.246 --> 08:57.148
Okay, take an hour to work your source.

08:57.215 --> 08:59.084
If nothing pans out,
you're doing cop calls.

08:59.150 --> 09:01.352
An hour? Jane, you're dreaming.

09:01.419 --> 09:03.121
No, I'm working under a deadline.

09:03.188 --> 09:04.455
Yeah, but this is a really important story,

09:04.522 --> 09:05.790
and if it's gonna be a cover...

09:05.856 --> 09:07.192
No, no, no, I know all about covers.

09:07.258 --> 09:09.294
Sam and I have had four
of them in the past month,

09:09.360 --> 09:11.829
and it doesn't involve leaving
your reporter high and dry.

09:11.896 --> 09:13.298
But Doug isn't on this story,

09:13.364 --> 09:14.632
and I still want to help you.

09:14.699 --> 09:17.302
I know. So do cop calls.

09:18.636 --> 09:19.637
No!

09:25.010 --> 09:26.244
Patti.

09:29.114 --> 09:32.984
Okay. I'll take the hour.

09:34.919 --> 09:36.421
I can do cop calls.

09:37.989 --> 09:39.324
Have you ever called the precincts?

09:39.390 --> 09:42.027
I ask if there's anything
on the blotter, right?

09:42.093 --> 09:45.730
We have two days to tear
down and rebuild the magazine

09:45.796 --> 09:48.266
on a developing story
over 3,000 miles away.

09:48.333 --> 09:49.967
Orientation's canceled today.

09:50.035 --> 09:51.136
I'll do the cop calls.

09:51.202 --> 09:52.770
What does your reporter need?

09:52.837 --> 09:54.005
I'll find out.

09:55.173 --> 09:56.574
Hi, this is Patti Robinson.

09:56.641 --> 09:58.043
I'm calling to speak with Betty Harris.

09:58.109 --> 10:00.611
Is she available?

10:00.678 --> 10:02.147
Yes, I'll hold.

10:05.616 --> 10:08.753
Uh-huh. You're fucking kidding me.

10:08.819 --> 10:11.456
They deliberated for 20 minutes?

10:11.522 --> 10:15.226
Manson and who El... Hold on.

10:15.293 --> 10:16.794
I think I'm your researcher,

10:16.861 --> 10:19.064
and I'm supposed to help
with the story Wick assigned.

10:19.130 --> 10:20.365
I've got it covered.

10:20.431 --> 10:22.767
Go ahead. Manson and who else?

10:24.001 --> 10:26.137
Uh-huh. Can I get a spelling?

10:28.206 --> 10:30.275
Now I get why you stay down here.

10:30.341 --> 10:33.844
Mm, cranky reporters in the bull pen?

10:33.911 --> 10:35.780
Testy researchers in the pit.

10:35.846 --> 10:37.082
Hmm.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.152
Do you like working at "News of the Week"?

10:41.219 --> 10:43.654
Mm. Mm-hmm.

10:43.721 --> 10:46.591
For me, it is ideal.

10:46.657 --> 10:50.195
Oh, right, you're not married yet, are you?

10:50.261 --> 10:52.530
See, um, my husband, Lenny,

10:52.597 --> 10:56.234
gave me a year to gather
materials for my first novel

10:56.301 --> 10:59.137
while he finishes law school
and gets a job at a firm,

10:59.204 --> 11:01.206
probably in Connecticut.

11:01.272 --> 11:03.308
Um, so I chose the magazine.

11:03.374 --> 11:06.411
Um, for me, it's a dream.

11:06.477 --> 11:09.147
And what happens after a year?

11:09.214 --> 11:12.217
I get serious and start a family.

11:12.283 --> 11:15.420
A serious family. Please don't
invite me to the dinner parties.

11:19.590 --> 11:21.159
Why don't you just stay
here and get stories?

11:21.226 --> 11:23.128
That's the only way to become a writer.

11:31.536 --> 11:33.404
Uh, I'm sorry.

11:35.340 --> 11:38.743
Uh. Um, I'm sorry, I'm just...

11:38.809 --> 11:41.479
I'm late for my... you know,

11:41.546 --> 11:42.980
but I always use a diaphragm

11:43.047 --> 11:46.151
so I don't understand how I, um...

11:55.025 --> 11:59.164
Maybe he put a hole in it.
People do that, you know.

11:59.164 --> 12:00.665
Lenny?

12:00.731 --> 12:03.734
Oh, he doesn't even know
where I keep that thing. I...

12:08.673 --> 12:10.475
Maybe he does.

12:14.078 --> 12:17.248
You don't think that my being a novelist

12:17.315 --> 12:19.250
sounds like a lark?

12:19.317 --> 12:22.487
I don't joke about writing or cooking.

12:22.553 --> 12:25.323
I don't joke about drinking or cooking.

12:25.390 --> 12:26.924
See, we're the perfect duo.

12:37.101 --> 12:38.703
Those of you following along at home,

12:38.769 --> 12:39.837
I have nothing.

12:39.904 --> 12:43.208
And the Jane clock says
I have 25 minutes left.

12:45.009 --> 12:46.311
What?

12:46.377 --> 12:47.645
It's like you guys are fighting over

12:47.712 --> 12:49.514
the lower bunk bed in jail.

12:51.549 --> 12:52.650
Who gets the to make the guys who are

12:52.717 --> 12:54.885
writing the story look better?

13:11.369 --> 13:13.771
You ready, Robinson?

13:13.838 --> 13:14.972
Not yet.

13:15.039 --> 13:16.140
Santana's PR girl gave me the number

13:16.241 --> 13:17.475
for the hotel room

13:17.542 --> 13:18.509
where one of the back
up singers is staying,

13:18.576 --> 13:20.110
and I want to talk to her.

13:20.245 --> 13:22.580
There are rumors that the
official police account is wrong.

13:22.647 --> 13:25.350
Then get a list of everything
the back up singer says

13:25.416 --> 13:27.252
that contradicts the official account,

13:27.252 --> 13:28.953
and turn it over to Jane.

13:29.019 --> 13:30.988
Those will be her leads to follow up on.

13:31.055 --> 13:32.257
Mm-hmm.

13:36.694 --> 13:38.429
So, meet at my place in an hour?

13:38.496 --> 13:40.798
I'll order from Vincenzo's.

13:40.865 --> 13:44.402
And finally replace that
scratched Van Morrison.

13:44.469 --> 13:45.770
An hour. I promise.

13:53.110 --> 13:55.413
Oh.

13:57.782 --> 13:59.884
Make it snow.

14:03.454 --> 14:05.155
We're finally in the same city

14:05.290 --> 14:08.158
after months of being pen pals.

14:08.293 --> 14:11.562
God. Maybe we can just...

14:11.629 --> 14:13.998
blow off the Rothko tomorrow
night and go out to dinner.

14:14.064 --> 14:17.668
Well, I already told my
parents you were coming.

14:17.735 --> 14:19.804
Oh.

14:19.870 --> 14:21.739
Your parents.

14:21.806 --> 14:23.408
I didn't, uh... I didn't know that

14:23.474 --> 14:25.410
they were a part of this event.

14:25.476 --> 14:27.378
It's... it's so conventional.

14:27.445 --> 14:29.447
I mean, I have to kiss the ring

14:29.514 --> 14:30.848
before we can start dating?

14:33.351 --> 14:35.886
You know, I wouldn't
mind meeting your parents.

14:35.953 --> 14:40.591
Oh, no. No one's meeting my parents. Ever.

14:40.658 --> 14:42.960
See you in an hour.

14:46.497 --> 14:47.798
What are you still doing here?

14:47.865 --> 14:49.800
I'm trying to reach
someone on the west coast.

14:49.867 --> 14:52.236
The police report that our
stringer read to Jane over the phone

14:52.337 --> 14:53.504
doesn't line up with some of the things

14:53.571 --> 14:55.806
that other people saw,

14:55.873 --> 14:58.443
so I'm trying to get the names
of the officers who were there.

14:58.509 --> 15:00.645
Yeah, well, that should be on
the bottom of the police report.

15:00.711 --> 15:02.246
On the bottom of the report

15:02.347 --> 15:04.349
the police chief himself signed it,

15:04.349 --> 15:06.884
and I know he wasn't
working at the concert.

15:06.951 --> 15:08.018
It's just odd.

15:10.521 --> 15:12.022
Atta girl, Patti.

15:26.471 --> 15:28.005
Hey, Tommy.

15:28.072 --> 15:29.440
- Thank you.
- Yep.

15:29.507 --> 15:31.376
How's it comin' on that Manson story?

15:31.376 --> 15:32.843
Oh, it's a straight down
the middle court story.

15:32.910 --> 15:33.978
Almost done.

15:34.044 --> 15:35.546
Good, good.

15:35.613 --> 15:37.682
Quite a cat fight last night.

15:37.748 --> 15:39.717
Peace ever break out in the pit?

15:39.784 --> 15:41.486
No idea.

15:41.552 --> 15:43.388
Patti was way over invested
in getting this cover.

15:43.421 --> 15:46.056
Well, researchers do not
get to pick the stories

15:46.123 --> 15:47.157
they want to work on.

15:47.224 --> 15:48.493
That is a slippery slope.

15:48.559 --> 15:50.495
They'll be writing fashion stories all day.

15:50.561 --> 15:53.464
Ha! Patti really took to San Francisco.

15:53.531 --> 15:55.500
Is it true that someone's
left a comb on her desk

15:55.566 --> 15:56.867
every morning since she got back?

15:56.934 --> 15:58.469
Looks like she put her finger in a socket.

15:58.536 --> 15:59.804
East coast hazing.

15:59.870 --> 16:01.772
First day back at work, she wore jeans.

16:01.839 --> 16:03.641
Well, she's still an attractive girl.

16:03.708 --> 16:05.576
But like I'd tell my daughters,

16:05.643 --> 16:07.678
no woman looks her best in jeans.

16:07.745 --> 16:09.780
Ah, Wick. You sound like an old man

16:09.847 --> 16:11.148
who doesn't know what's cool anymore.

16:11.215 --> 16:12.617
Heads up.

16:17.054 --> 16:18.789
See, Sam.

16:18.856 --> 16:21.659
Real women never go out of style.

16:21.726 --> 16:23.428
No, coffee's supposed to be black.

16:23.428 --> 16:24.662
You don't put milk in coffee.

16:24.729 --> 16:26.431
- Hello. Good morning.
- Miss Robinson.

16:26.431 --> 16:27.632
Oh, I was just coming to find you.

16:29.333 --> 16:31.869
So sorry I stood you up last night.

16:31.936 --> 16:34.439
I was working late and I
just crashed in the infirmary.

16:34.505 --> 16:36.574
Don't try and soften me up.

16:40.945 --> 16:42.447
Why don't you let me make it up to you.

16:42.447 --> 16:44.882
Hmm? Tonight. 8:00.

16:44.949 --> 16:48.152
Tonight is Rothko with my parents.

16:48.218 --> 16:50.855
Okay. A week ago we were
sending each other letters

16:50.921 --> 16:53.223
sprayed with sandalwood oil, man.

16:53.290 --> 16:54.959
What happened?

16:55.025 --> 16:55.960
That was a dream.

16:56.026 --> 16:57.361
You moved back home to New York.

16:57.462 --> 16:58.362
To reality.

16:58.463 --> 17:00.097
I'm young.

17:00.164 --> 17:03.634
I want to have fun, I want
to tiptoe through the tulips.

17:03.701 --> 17:07.104
I feel like you're
trying to put me in a box.

17:07.171 --> 17:08.573
I'm not.

17:08.638 --> 17:10.040
Is that what you think of getting dolled up

17:10.107 --> 17:11.075
for a night on the town?

17:15.244 --> 17:17.615
I don't have anything to wear.

17:21.486 --> 17:23.721
They're gonna love you.

17:23.788 --> 17:26.089
I already told them how happy you make me.

17:29.093 --> 17:31.061
I'll meet you at the Guggenheim at 8:00.

17:32.497 --> 17:34.164
Hey, babe.

17:34.231 --> 17:36.233
If you don't change, everyone's gonna think

17:36.300 --> 17:38.002
you came home with me anyway.

17:39.336 --> 17:41.171
People. My people.

17:41.238 --> 17:42.573
Let's commit journalism here.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.041
Award winning journalism.

17:44.108 --> 17:46.376
Comfort the afflicted,
afflict the comfortable.

17:46.511 --> 17:48.646
Copy desk, are we over or
under for the back of the book?

17:48.713 --> 17:50.147
- We're right on target, Finn.
- Good.

17:50.214 --> 17:52.517
And that's when you saw
the first guy fall down

17:52.583 --> 17:55.252
or get pushed down?

17:56.420 --> 17:57.888
I'm not saying it's shit,

17:57.955 --> 17:59.624
but you might want to take
another stab at that lead.

17:59.690 --> 18:01.759
Starting off with a quote
won't fly, believe me.

18:01.826 --> 18:04.662
Animal... animal hat?

18:04.729 --> 18:07.431
The Hell's Angel was wearing an animal hat?

18:07.532 --> 18:10.167
Can you approve this caption?

18:10.234 --> 18:12.036
What kind of animal hat?

18:12.102 --> 18:14.104
Since when is Central
fucking Highlands a dateline?

18:14.171 --> 18:15.439
Get the nearest city. We don't do regions.

18:15.540 --> 18:16.674
And run it by Wick.

18:16.741 --> 18:17.708
- Okay.
- Tell him you showed me.

18:17.775 --> 18:18.943
Talia wanted me to remind you

18:19.009 --> 18:20.745
about Lydia's birthday dinner tonight.

18:20.811 --> 18:22.613
Oh, Christ.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.048
I'm nowhere near the editor's page.

18:24.114 --> 18:25.583
I don't suppose you could run out and grab

18:25.650 --> 18:27.417
a birthday gift for a 13 year old girl?

18:27.552 --> 18:30.054
Talia already called in a jewelry
box from Tiffany's. I picked it up.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.056
They move people through dinner
service quickly at Serendipity.

18:32.122 --> 18:34.091
You'll be off the clock
for 90 minutes tops.

18:34.158 --> 18:35.926
A lot can happen here in 90
minutes, Ange. Anything else?

18:35.993 --> 18:37.862
How about you start
calling me by my full name?

18:37.928 --> 18:40.798
Nope. That'd take too long.

18:40.865 --> 18:43.568
Jane. Jane. I got it.

18:43.568 --> 18:44.735
My lead panned out.

18:44.802 --> 18:45.903
The back up singer saw everything,

18:45.970 --> 18:47.171
and there's just one hitch.

18:47.237 --> 18:49.339
- What is it?
- Not for attribution.

18:49.406 --> 18:50.474
Oh, well, then she's no use to us.

18:50.575 --> 18:52.476
- Jane.
- No, don't.

18:52.577 --> 18:54.411
I was here late last night doing cop calls.

18:54.478 --> 18:55.412
- I was here, too.
- Where?

18:55.479 --> 18:56.747
I fell asleep.

18:56.814 --> 18:58.649
Because I was waiting on
a gigantic lead for you,

18:58.716 --> 19:01.151
and if you would just listen to
what I got, you would thank me.

19:01.218 --> 19:03.754
Just not here.

19:07.725 --> 19:09.727
Okay, now without yelling at me,

19:09.794 --> 19:11.061
tell me what she said.

19:13.497 --> 19:14.765
The police blame the hippies,

19:14.832 --> 19:17.334
but she blamed the Hell's Angels

19:17.401 --> 19:18.803
that were hired as security.

19:18.869 --> 19:20.971
One of the gang members had a knife, Jane.

19:21.038 --> 19:23.107
They started the riot, not the fans.

19:23.173 --> 19:24.609
So they're hiding something.

19:24.609 --> 19:26.243
Shit.

19:26.310 --> 19:27.411
That's good.

19:27.477 --> 19:29.046
I know.

19:29.113 --> 19:30.648
There were 300,000 people there,

19:30.715 --> 19:32.082
but no law enforcement presence whatsoever.

19:32.149 --> 19:33.851
Patti says Alameda County can't produce

19:33.918 --> 19:37.387
the name of even one deputy
assigned to the festival.

19:37.454 --> 19:38.789
What?

19:38.856 --> 19:40.357
You're pretty cute when you've got a scoop.

19:40.424 --> 19:42.727
- Oh.
- Tell me more.

19:42.793 --> 19:45.696
The Hell's Angels were hired as security.

19:45.763 --> 19:47.932
They were paid in beer, Sam.

19:47.998 --> 19:50.300
But they escalated things
instead of controlling them.

19:50.367 --> 19:51.568
Is that for me?

19:51.636 --> 19:54.404
It's what we've got so far.

19:54.471 --> 19:56.106
Oh, yeah, this is good.

19:56.173 --> 19:58.075
I also need the official
story from the cops

19:58.142 --> 19:59.677
- on details of the riot.
- Oh, you know I've got that.

19:59.744 --> 20:01.445
Good, because we're
gonna need something else

20:01.511 --> 20:04.381
in case Wick won't let me use
your back up singer off the record.

20:04.448 --> 20:06.316
He's meeting with the department
heads for another half hour.

20:06.383 --> 20:08.185
Work on the plan B version
of the story until then,

20:08.252 --> 20:10.020
and then you and I go and talk to him.

20:10.087 --> 20:11.588
- Okay, great.
- Wait, hey.

20:11.656 --> 20:12.957
- Not so fast.
- Hmm?

20:13.023 --> 20:15.292
So, Finn wants to have lunch with me.

20:15.359 --> 20:17.261
He wants to talk about putting
me on the investigative beat.

20:17.327 --> 20:18.729
He does? That's great.

20:18.796 --> 20:21.198
Yeah, well, four covers in
a row? Of course he does.

20:21.265 --> 20:23.567
I am so proud of you.

20:23.634 --> 20:25.269
Hey, as far as I can tell,

20:25.335 --> 20:29.006
you and I are kicking everybody
else's ass in the city.

21:03.874 --> 21:07.477

21:07.544 --> 21:08.578
All right, who is this?

21:08.713 --> 21:12.582
Oh, it's, um...

21:12.717 --> 21:14.719
It's Iron Butterfly.

21:14.785 --> 21:16.721
- Iron Butterfly.
- Mm-hmm.

21:16.787 --> 21:18.088
The song will haunt you

21:18.155 --> 21:20.991
because you have such a good ear for music.

21:21.058 --> 21:22.626
- Do I?
- Mm-hmm.

21:22.727 --> 21:25.362
I heard you singing Otis
Redding the other morning.

21:25.429 --> 21:28.532
Ah-ha. Well, Redding is
in a class by himself.

21:28.598 --> 21:30.200
He's a true original.

21:30.267 --> 21:33.237
Now these guys, these Iron Butterflies,

21:33.303 --> 21:35.505
I may need some time getting used to them.

21:35.572 --> 21:37.742
You should really get high first.

21:37.742 --> 21:39.276
Then you'll really dig it.

21:39.343 --> 21:41.979
Well, I'm over 30. I'm too old to try pot.

21:42.046 --> 21:45.482
Oh, no. No one's too old to smoke out.

21:45.549 --> 21:48.552
That's good to know.

21:50.755 --> 21:52.522
Patti, help me out.

21:52.589 --> 21:56.193
Why were the Hell's
Angels hired for security?

21:56.260 --> 22:00.630
Because nobody trusts the police.

22:00.765 --> 22:02.199
Why?

22:02.266 --> 22:06.603
Because they would arrest
you for smoking marijuana.

22:06.670 --> 22:08.839
And ever since the cops beat
up those kids in Chicago,

22:08.906 --> 22:10.440
everyone thinks they're pigs.

22:10.507 --> 22:14.111
So the bands felt safer hiring
an outlaw motorcycle gang.

22:14.178 --> 22:15.279
Yeah.

22:15.345 --> 22:17.915
The Hell's Angels smoke
pot and like to party.

22:17.982 --> 22:21.218
They were at Ken Kesey's acid trips.

22:21.285 --> 22:22.686
So?

22:22.787 --> 22:24.354
So they bonded at those parties.

22:24.421 --> 22:26.824
There was a kinship.

22:26.891 --> 22:28.926
Yeah, but doing drugs
doesn't necessarily mean

22:28.993 --> 22:30.560
you believe in peace and love.

22:30.627 --> 22:32.562
Well, yes, it does.

22:32.629 --> 22:37.267
Uh, I mean it... did.

22:37.334 --> 22:39.636
It was supposed to.

22:39.703 --> 22:44.041
I guess Altamont changed that.

22:45.609 --> 22:46.811
Yeah.

22:52.116 --> 22:53.951
I'm going to write my editor's page.

23:03.127 --> 23:06.396
Well, these culture stories,

23:06.463 --> 23:09.199
they're not permission to get
lax on journalistic standards.

23:13.570 --> 23:14.872
We need full names.

23:14.939 --> 23:17.641
Can't say I'm surprised at your decision.

23:17.707 --> 23:19.143
Bummed out, but not surprised.

23:19.209 --> 23:20.878
But Patti said her source is still...

23:20.945 --> 23:23.113
Patti? What does Patti
have to do with this?

23:23.180 --> 23:24.882
- Patti sounded...
- Patti found the source.

23:27.651 --> 23:29.219
All right.

23:29.286 --> 23:31.321
Mr. Rosenberg, I hope
you're not too bummed out

23:31.388 --> 23:34.391
to write an airtight story for us,

23:34.458 --> 23:37.027
with real sources, authorities,
or elected officials.

23:37.094 --> 23:40.064
And then we'll see if the story merits

23:40.130 --> 23:42.732
the cover of the magazine.

23:42.867 --> 23:45.669
- All right?
- You got it, Wick.

23:45.735 --> 23:47.704
- Young lady.
- Mm-hmm?

23:47.771 --> 23:49.239
Could you get me a cup of coffee?

23:49.306 --> 23:50.975
Absolutely. Black, two sugars?

23:51.041 --> 23:52.309
- Yes.
- Okay.

23:52.376 --> 23:54.011
Thank you.

23:58.148 --> 24:00.150
Wick is the one trying to sabotage this

24:00.217 --> 24:04.889
because he wants his stupid
cover on troop reduction.

24:04.889 --> 24:06.456
I can get my source to go on the record,

24:06.523 --> 24:07.892
I know I can.

24:07.925 --> 24:10.494
I just can't convince
her to do it on the phone.

24:10.560 --> 24:11.896
What are you saying?

24:11.962 --> 24:12.930
Oh, you want to fly to
San Francisco tonight,

24:12.997 --> 24:14.464
and get her to go on the record

24:14.531 --> 24:16.533
all before the presses
start running tomorrow night?

24:16.600 --> 24:18.602
Yeah. No, no, exactly.

24:18.668 --> 24:20.404
Look, the flight schedules work,

24:20.470 --> 24:24.008
I just... I don't have
the money for a ticket.

24:24.074 --> 24:25.675
Can you use your dad's credit card?

24:25.742 --> 24:27.044
You can't be serious.

24:27.111 --> 24:30.214
We're too close to give up now.

24:34.084 --> 24:35.185
Your car is downstairs.

24:35.252 --> 24:36.553
I'm not gonna make it.

24:36.620 --> 24:38.688
The presses start running in 26 hours.

24:38.755 --> 24:39.957
Why don't you head down to Serendipity

24:40.024 --> 24:41.558
and give that gift to Lydia yourself.

24:41.625 --> 24:44.361
- She's gonna be furious.
- Furious, yeah.

24:44.428 --> 24:45.963
I'll deal with the consequences.

24:48.532 --> 24:51.301
- Thank you, Ange.
- You're welcome, Fineas.

25:08.852 --> 25:10.820
Oh, thank God.

25:10.955 --> 25:12.322
Patti!

25:12.389 --> 25:13.290
Patti.

25:13.357 --> 25:15.192
Oh, good, you got the gloves.

25:15.259 --> 25:16.660
- Yeah.
- I'm glad you spent a little extra

25:16.726 --> 25:17.962
for the 11 inch style.

25:18.028 --> 25:19.329
The ones that hit you
right at the wrist bone

25:19.396 --> 25:21.065
are the least functional
things I have ever...

25:21.131 --> 25:22.599
Nora, what are you doing here?

25:22.666 --> 25:23.867
Oh, Jane sent me.

25:23.968 --> 25:25.235
She wanted me to give you this.

25:29.339 --> 25:31.275
She said it's really important.

25:36.280 --> 25:39.616

27:20.317 --> 27:23.087
I... I, um... I just dropped my...

27:23.120 --> 27:24.488
brush.

27:24.554 --> 27:26.590
I'm trying to finish
my work, Cindy, come on.

27:26.656 --> 27:29.959
I just haven't slept
well the last few nights.

27:30.094 --> 27:32.596
I'm...

27:32.662 --> 27:34.464
clumsy.

27:34.531 --> 27:36.100
You didn't eat much dinner.

27:38.935 --> 27:41.105
I ate.

27:41.171 --> 27:42.739
What do you women even do in there?

27:44.674 --> 27:46.643
I'll be out soon.

27:46.710 --> 27:49.479
Hurry up. I want us to watch Ed Sullivan.

28:21.445 --> 28:24.314
I'm telling you, he
was no threat to anyone.

28:24.381 --> 28:25.782
And those bikers were kicking him.

28:25.849 --> 28:27.151
They were high as kites.

28:27.217 --> 28:29.286
And one of the Hell's
Angels had an animal hat,

28:29.353 --> 28:31.988
or the head of an animal or something?

28:32.055 --> 28:34.891
The Hell's Angels guys were
throwing entire beer cans at people.

28:34.958 --> 28:37.661
And the biker with the
moustache stabbed that poor guy.

28:37.727 --> 28:38.995
But the Dead bailed.

28:39.062 --> 28:40.364
'Cause they knew those Hell's Angels.

28:40.430 --> 28:43.433
Okay, so you're saying the Dead fled.

28:44.301 --> 28:46.803
Got it. Okay.

28:46.870 --> 28:50.174
I cannot thank you enough
for talking to me, Danielle.

28:50.207 --> 28:53.510
I'm just gonna need your full name
and your hometown and your age.

28:53.577 --> 28:55.979
No, I don't want anything
about me in print.

28:56.045 --> 28:57.547
Like I told you before,

28:57.614 --> 28:59.816
I am gonna read all of
your quotes back to you.

28:59.883 --> 29:04.188
No, I don't want my name, age
or anything about me in there.

29:04.221 --> 29:05.622
I'm disposable.

29:05.689 --> 29:07.291
I'm a back up singer.

29:07.357 --> 29:10.059
My job is to sweeten the band's sound.

29:10.194 --> 29:13.930
And I do that only as long as I
look good and sound good to them.

29:13.997 --> 29:15.765
You dig it?

29:15.832 --> 29:16.600
Yeah, I dig it.

29:16.666 --> 29:18.268
If anyone from a record company

29:18.335 --> 29:21.205
reads that I'm up there
with an opinion of my own...

29:21.271 --> 29:23.106
That I'm a narc...

29:23.207 --> 29:27.644
I'll be moppin' floors instead
of singing in amphitheaters.

29:27.711 --> 29:29.246
"News of the Week" won't print

29:29.313 --> 29:31.915
anonymous sources, Danielle.

29:33.317 --> 29:34.918
Then my quotes won't be in.

29:37.921 --> 29:39.155
Wait.

29:39.223 --> 29:41.325
Did you talk to anyone on stage afterwards?

29:41.391 --> 29:45.161
No. Up on stage is just me and the boys.

29:45.229 --> 29:47.697
And the groupies who rush them.

29:47.764 --> 29:50.234
Do you think any of them would talk to me?

30:09.519 --> 30:13.590
Any friend of Danielle's is welcome here.

30:13.657 --> 30:16.326
It's been such a rough
weekend for all of us.

30:17.694 --> 30:20.464
Danielle did not tell me
you were a plaster caster.

30:20.530 --> 30:23.433
The best in all of Haight-Ashbury.

30:23.500 --> 30:26.270
Go ahead, touch 'em.

30:26.336 --> 30:28.605
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:28.672 --> 30:31.808
Hold them and suck 'em if you want.

30:31.875 --> 30:32.842
Just don't break 'em.

30:32.909 --> 30:35.279
This is a gallery of my conquests.

30:35.345 --> 30:38.282
So sorry, but I have to get on a plane

30:38.315 --> 30:40.116
back to New York in two hours.

30:40.183 --> 30:42.586
How can I support your journey?

30:42.652 --> 30:45.355
Um...

30:45.422 --> 30:47.291
Can you tell me everything you saw

30:47.324 --> 30:49.326
before the fan was stabbed?

30:49.393 --> 30:52.529
And, um, who pulled the knife?

30:53.963 --> 30:56.633
I bet my Jim Morrison it was Mr. Moustache.

30:56.700 --> 31:00.937
What about the animal hat guy?

31:01.004 --> 31:02.406
Oh, he didn't have a knife.

31:02.472 --> 31:04.908
Mr. Moustache stabbed that poor kid.

31:04.974 --> 31:06.142
Do you have his name?

31:06.209 --> 31:07.677
The kid or Mr. Moustache?

31:07.744 --> 31:09.513
Yes. Both.

31:12.015 --> 31:14.050
Jane. Jane.

31:17.186 --> 31:18.588
Hello?

31:18.655 --> 31:20.324
Collect call from Patti Robinson.

31:20.324 --> 31:21.458
Do you accept the charges?

31:21.525 --> 31:22.992
Yes. Yes, yes.

31:23.059 --> 31:25.094
Lucy Henderson.

31:25.161 --> 31:26.996
She goes by the name Juicy Lucy.

31:27.063 --> 31:28.932
I need everything you have on her.

31:28.998 --> 31:30.800
What else?

31:30.867 --> 31:32.101
I need the name of two Hell's Angels.

31:32.168 --> 31:33.337
I only know them as

31:33.403 --> 31:35.071
Mr. Moustache and Mr. Animal Head.

31:35.138 --> 31:36.806
See if you can get Oakland P.D. to ID them.

31:36.873 --> 31:38.608
I need to get a taxi
and get to the airport,

31:38.675 --> 31:40.377
or I'm gonna miss my flight.

31:42.245 --> 31:43.380
Yes!

31:59.363 --> 32:00.997
Is Patti in yet?

32:01.064 --> 32:05.735
Uh, I just brewed a fresh pot of coffee.

32:05.802 --> 32:06.903
Is Patti in, Jane?

32:06.970 --> 32:08.004
I haven't seen her.

32:10.940 --> 32:12.241
What's goin' on?

32:12.376 --> 32:13.477
Not now.

32:15.879 --> 32:17.146
You were right.

32:17.213 --> 32:20.016
I think he put a hole in it.

32:22.519 --> 32:23.887
Could you work here if you were pregnant?

32:23.953 --> 32:24.821
Would they let you?

32:24.888 --> 32:26.956
No one's ever done that before.

32:27.023 --> 32:31.194
Um, it doesn't matter. Lenny
would make me stay home.

32:31.260 --> 32:33.663
Okay, I know the best
gynecologist in the city.

32:33.730 --> 32:35.031
He's near the park, upper 80s,

32:35.098 --> 32:36.600
and across the street from his office

32:36.666 --> 32:38.802
you can get the most
delicious egg salad sandwich...

32:38.868 --> 32:41.270
Oh, um, I've heard it on good authority

32:41.405 --> 32:42.439
that you can sit at Patti's desk today,

32:42.506 --> 32:44.173
'cause she flew to San Francisco.

32:44.240 --> 32:46.476
- Great.
- We specifically didn't tell her.

32:46.543 --> 32:47.844
- She's cool.
- It's okay.

32:47.911 --> 32:49.846
No one's gonna ask me anything anyway.

32:49.913 --> 32:52.682
Good morning, my whispering coven.

32:52.749 --> 32:53.950
Hi.

32:54.017 --> 32:55.919
Patti's not at her desk and we close today.

32:55.985 --> 32:58.021
- She's sick.
- Is she sick?

32:58.087 --> 32:59.856
- Very ill.
- Death's door.

32:59.923 --> 33:01.691
Well, I feel like shit and I'm here.

33:01.758 --> 33:03.627
Call her and tell her to come in.

33:05.128 --> 33:06.663
Absolutely, I will.

33:15.171 --> 33:16.272
- Thank you.
- Hi.

33:16.339 --> 33:17.641
What do you know?

33:17.707 --> 33:19.242
You can't go inside dressed like that.

33:19.308 --> 33:20.910
I have clothes. Tell me what you know.

33:20.977 --> 33:21.878
I got the names.

33:21.945 --> 33:23.613
People are devastated out there, Jane.

33:23.680 --> 33:25.882
There's devastation in here, too.

33:25.949 --> 33:30.086
I lied to Finn. He wanted to see you.

33:30.153 --> 33:31.521
And Doug asked for you.

33:31.588 --> 33:33.857
Oh, no. What did you tell him?

33:33.923 --> 33:35.459
Wh...

33:35.459 --> 33:37.461
Shit!

33:37.527 --> 33:40.464
Ah, shit. Lefty O'Doul died.

33:40.530 --> 33:42.866
Oh, tough loss. I saw DiMaggio play once.

33:42.932 --> 33:45.168
He and Lefty were pretty
close. What do we know, Sam?

33:45.234 --> 33:46.870
Detailed eyewitness
account from two sources.

33:46.936 --> 33:48.472
Great. What did these guys see?

33:48.505 --> 33:50.106
- The guys are gals.
- Who are these gals?

33:50.173 --> 33:51.875
Um, one of theme won't let us use her name.

33:51.941 --> 33:53.610
Wick said that was a no go,
so we found another woman

33:53.677 --> 33:54.611
who was in the front
row, confirmed everything,

33:54.678 --> 33:55.779
and agreed to be named.

33:55.845 --> 33:57.080
That's good journalism. Atta boy.

33:57.146 --> 33:58.548
- Who's the woman?
- Patti?

33:58.615 --> 34:00.249
Legally, her name is Lucy Henderson.

34:00.316 --> 34:01.518
What do you mean by legally?

34:01.585 --> 34:03.620
Her professional name is Juicy Lucy.

34:05.922 --> 34:07.223
I majored in History at Princeton.

34:07.290 --> 34:08.592
- Did you know that?
- Yes.

34:08.658 --> 34:10.059
One of the things that
stuck with me over the years

34:10.126 --> 34:12.094
is what I learned about
ancient Roman dentistry.

34:12.161 --> 34:14.797
To treat a toothache, they
advocated gargling with urine.

34:14.864 --> 34:18.167
And it was only after prolonged
and ineffectual swishing with piss

34:18.234 --> 34:20.770
that an extraction would
ultimately be undertaken.

34:20.837 --> 34:22.505
My point is, how much
more of this must I endure

34:22.572 --> 34:24.139
before we give up, run wire copy inside,

34:24.206 --> 34:25.775
and use Wick's Vietnam story as a cover?

34:25.842 --> 34:28.377
Oh, come on, Finn. We
got a smart, fresh cover.

34:28.512 --> 34:29.978
Fantastic. Juicy Lucy.

34:30.045 --> 34:32.014
Mr. and Mrs. Henderson must be very proud

34:32.081 --> 34:33.717
of their daughter's professional name.

34:33.783 --> 34:35.784
Now, what does Miss Henderson do?

34:35.851 --> 34:37.521
- Sh...
- She's, um,

34:37.521 --> 34:39.723
- an artist?
- You don't sound convinced.

34:39.789 --> 34:41.525
Um, she's a... she's a sculptor.

34:41.591 --> 34:43.860
Sort of obscure outside of the Bay area.

34:43.927 --> 34:45.795
But, uh, in music
circles, she's well known.

34:45.862 --> 34:47.531
Within music circles in the Bay area.

34:47.597 --> 34:49.065
What does Juicy sculpt?

34:54.170 --> 34:55.539
Penises.

34:57.173 --> 34:59.008
She's a plaster caster.

34:59.075 --> 35:03.580
She casts the penises of famous...

35:03.647 --> 35:04.648
rock stars.

35:04.714 --> 35:06.149
Why... why would she do this?

35:06.215 --> 35:07.884
Well, she's not the only one, actually.

35:07.951 --> 35:09.218
There is a woman named Cynthia...

35:09.285 --> 35:12.556
But he asked why, right?
Why she casts the men?

35:13.690 --> 35:15.224
I think it's like a trophy

35:15.291 --> 35:18.027
to prove that she's been
intimate with these men.

35:18.094 --> 35:20.463
We have a back up singer
who won't go on the record,

35:20.564 --> 35:21.898
and a loopy promiscuous woman

35:21.965 --> 35:23.032
who's the back up to the back up singer.

35:23.099 --> 35:24.668
This is a three-ring circus, folks.

35:24.734 --> 35:27.103
But both of their stories
support one another.

35:29.573 --> 35:31.040
Juicy Lucy,

35:31.107 --> 35:34.811
the dick sculptor, is not credible.

35:34.878 --> 35:35.945
Why?

35:36.012 --> 35:38.414
Because no one on the subway

35:38.481 --> 35:40.584
or the entire state of Wisconsin,

35:40.584 --> 35:41.751
can relate to them.

35:41.818 --> 35:43.853
They're not mainstream, honey.

35:43.920 --> 35:47.090
There are our
man-on-the-street interviews,

35:47.156 --> 35:50.594
except that they happen
to be women with no clout.

35:58.702 --> 36:01.070
Who's source is she?

36:01.137 --> 36:02.606
Patti's.

36:02.639 --> 36:03.907
Our holy terror.

36:03.973 --> 36:05.909
Hey, look, if it's any reassurance,

36:05.975 --> 36:07.711
it's my byline if we crash and burn.

36:07.777 --> 36:09.012
But it's my magazine.

36:09.078 --> 36:10.046
Yeah.

36:25.729 --> 36:26.896
Let's run with it.

36:29.498 --> 36:32.201
- Thank you, Finn.
- Thank you, Finn.

36:32.268 --> 36:33.637
Good work, everyone.

36:41.945 --> 36:45.982
Oh, God! I knew I could
break this story wide open,

36:46.049 --> 36:48.351
- and I did.
- Yeah, for Sam.

36:48.417 --> 36:49.919
He'll get the byline.

36:49.986 --> 36:50.954
What?

36:52.255 --> 36:54.390
You stood me up.

36:54.457 --> 36:55.759
For the second night in a row.

36:55.825 --> 36:57.794
You lied to me so that
you could help Sam...

36:57.861 --> 37:01.530
Are you listening to a word I'm saying?

37:01.665 --> 37:02.766
Jetting of to the west coast

37:02.832 --> 37:04.901
to convince a source to talk to me.

37:04.968 --> 37:07.136
That's the most exciting
thing I've ever done.

37:07.203 --> 37:09.338
My God, is there a "we" in any of this?

37:11.440 --> 37:15.311
I'm sorry I stood you up.

37:15.378 --> 37:17.681
Twice.

37:17.714 --> 37:21.417
Do you remember when, against all odds,

37:21.484 --> 37:25.021
you convinced the Colonel to talk
to you about the Tet Offensive?

37:25.088 --> 37:26.389
And the whole newsroom cheered

37:26.455 --> 37:29.693
when you called in with
1,800 words of dictation

37:29.759 --> 37:32.696
that changed the way
people viewed that event.

37:32.729 --> 37:38.101
Last night, I understood
how that must have felt.

37:38.167 --> 37:39.869
That rush.

37:41.805 --> 37:44.607
But you're not a reporter.

37:44.708 --> 37:46.710
You're a researcher.

37:48.945 --> 37:50.113
And we had a date.

38:16.773 --> 38:18.241
You turned the ship around.

38:18.307 --> 38:21.778
Yeah. That felt pretty good.

38:22.879 --> 38:23.880
Why did you stay on the story

38:23.947 --> 38:26.315
even after they gave it to Jane?

38:26.382 --> 38:28.384
I don't know.

38:28.451 --> 38:30.954
I just could not let that go, I guess.

38:31.020 --> 38:33.322
For the magazine, For Doug, for Sam?

38:33.389 --> 38:36.025
For work. For me.

38:44.167 --> 38:45.769
We hold consciousness raising meetings

38:45.835 --> 38:48.171
here at this address on Monday nights.

38:48.237 --> 38:49.605
Why don't you come?

38:49.672 --> 38:51.174
I'll introduce you to some fabulous girls

38:51.240 --> 38:53.576
trying to do exactly what you just did.

38:53.642 --> 38:55.378
Yeah. Okay.

38:55.444 --> 38:57.013
See you then.

39:00.683 --> 39:02.485
Consciousness.

39:02.551 --> 39:04.087
Consciousness raising.

39:21.805 --> 39:23.172
Altamont is a different kind of story

39:23.239 --> 39:24.673
than troop withdrawal, Wick.

39:24.808 --> 39:26.375
But no less important.

39:26.442 --> 39:28.077
Well, in terms of sheer numbers,

39:28.144 --> 39:29.879
we lost more young men on Saturday

39:29.946 --> 39:31.514
in the jungles of Vietnam

39:31.580 --> 39:33.917
than we did on the
fairgrounds outside of Berkley.

39:33.983 --> 39:36.552
This is, uh, for the culture section,

39:36.619 --> 39:38.421
the back of the book.

39:38.487 --> 39:40.957
No, it's not.

39:41.024 --> 39:42.992
'Cause if I'm gonna ensure our relevance,

39:43.059 --> 39:45.161
we gotta cover the story
of the counter-culture.

39:45.228 --> 39:48.164
My Lai three weeks ago and
last week's anti-war march,

39:48.231 --> 39:49.398
those... those warranted covers.

39:49.465 --> 39:51.134
Anti-war covers.

39:51.200 --> 39:53.970
'Cause the people are
shouting it from the rooftops.

39:54.037 --> 39:55.304
They've turned against this war, Wick.

39:55.371 --> 39:57.006
So your Pentagon source concerned that

39:57.073 --> 39:59.843
troop withdrawal will
only deepen the quagmire,

39:59.909 --> 40:01.110
that feels dated.

40:01.177 --> 40:02.946
Come on, it wasn't dated three days ago

40:03.012 --> 40:04.513
when we sent it typeset.

40:04.580 --> 40:06.082
That's true.

40:06.149 --> 40:09.452
And then a free love festival exploded.

40:09.518 --> 40:12.321
Because the counter-culture
itself is starting a new chapter.

40:12.388 --> 40:14.858
It's a sea change, for Christ's sake.

40:14.924 --> 40:16.759
And Altamont, in my humble opinion,

40:16.826 --> 40:18.494
is the perfect aperture to show that.

40:18.561 --> 40:20.463
Finn, come on, you're jerking yourself off

40:20.529 --> 40:23.199
with some intellectual debate
about cultural coverage.

40:23.266 --> 40:25.568
You know it's our duty to cover a war

40:25.634 --> 40:27.770
where families are losing their
fathers, their sons, their cousins,

40:27.837 --> 40:29.405
- they're nephews...
- Okay, look,

40:29.472 --> 40:31.807
with all due respect to your
personal connection to this war...

40:31.875 --> 40:33.142
I am here as a newsman.

40:33.209 --> 40:37.080
Please, do not insult me
by making this personal.

40:44.888 --> 40:47.156
Finn. Finn.

40:49.025 --> 40:51.227
The day a story about a music festival

40:51.294 --> 40:53.529
trumps a story about a war we're fighting

40:53.596 --> 40:55.932
is a day that I don't know my fucking ass

40:55.999 --> 40:57.566
from a hole in the ground.

40:57.633 --> 41:01.137
Wick, we've had 14 covers on
Vietnam in the past 12 months.

41:02.438 --> 41:03.907
We done.

41:15.751 --> 41:18.021
I like the flower.

41:18.087 --> 41:19.588
Oh, look, it's for a cover.

41:19.655 --> 41:20.924
I like human eyes.

41:20.957 --> 41:23.960
I put the close up of
the heartbroken hippie.

41:24.027 --> 41:25.428
Do you ever put an eye loop on each eye

41:25.494 --> 41:26.795
and walk around the newsroom?

41:26.930 --> 41:28.932
No.

41:32.468 --> 41:34.770
Oh, I read the short story
you left me last night.

41:34.938 --> 41:36.539
It was beautiful.

41:36.605 --> 41:38.274
Thank you.

41:38.341 --> 41:39.943
Um, it was, um...

41:40.009 --> 41:43.947
It was the last thing I wrote, actually.

41:44.013 --> 41:45.949
Right after college.

41:45.982 --> 41:48.251
Hey. You okay?

41:49.118 --> 41:51.120
Oh, yeah. No, I just, um...

41:51.187 --> 41:53.456
I just haven't slept much lately.

41:53.522 --> 41:55.124
Did you do my job for me yet?

41:55.191 --> 41:58.127
- Oh, yeah, flower.
- Close up hippie.

42:00.029 --> 42:01.330
I left you two choices.

42:01.397 --> 42:04.968
You present me with the same two choices.

42:05.001 --> 42:06.569
It's unacceptable.

42:06.635 --> 42:08.137
- Well...
- Oh, I mean, there's the...

42:08.204 --> 42:11.340
- Very clear choice.
- clear right answer.

42:11.407 --> 42:12.341
I got an idea.

42:12.408 --> 42:16.045
Why don't you arm wrestle over it?

42:16.112 --> 42:17.613
So boring.

42:17.680 --> 42:19.983
Ouch. Just pretend like
you're seriously working.

42:20.049 --> 42:22.251
I don't want to get fired here, okay?

42:22.318 --> 42:23.552
I actually can't see...

42:23.619 --> 42:25.088
- a goddamn thing.
- I love that photo.

42:25.154 --> 42:27.190
Whoever took that photo
is a great photographer.

42:29.658 --> 42:30.859
Yes!

42:30.994 --> 42:33.796
Oh, my God. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

42:33.862 --> 42:35.131
Hah!

42:35.198 --> 42:38.701
- Cindy?
- Oh, I... I got my period.

42:38.767 --> 42:40.003
Is this the first time?

42:40.036 --> 42:41.804
Oh, uh, no, no.

42:41.870 --> 42:44.173
No, but I got... Ooh! I got it.

42:44.240 --> 42:46.842
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

42:46.909 --> 42:48.077
Ooh!

42:51.780 --> 42:52.915
All right, everyone.

42:53.016 --> 42:55.018
I want everybody to gather here.

42:56.052 --> 42:57.553
Could everybody gather?

42:57.620 --> 42:59.088
Oh, that's Wick's muster call.

42:59.155 --> 43:02.525
I... I will be out there in a minute.

43:02.591 --> 43:06.762
This piece hit the bull's eye.

43:06.829 --> 43:08.531
And should be a lesson.

43:08.597 --> 43:11.134
A new kid on our team took what he called

43:11.200 --> 43:13.236
a straight down the middle court story,

43:13.302 --> 43:16.339
and elevated it to a damn good think piece.

43:20.243 --> 43:22.278
"The murders illuminated
the free love movement

43:22.345 --> 43:24.380
"with the black light of banality.

43:24.447 --> 43:28.051
"Far from the pernicious
threat of Communism overseas,

43:28.084 --> 43:30.319
"we were reminded again this week

43:30.386 --> 43:32.255
"that the United States of America

43:32.321 --> 43:34.457
"remains a dangerous place.

43:34.523 --> 43:37.060
"300 miles from the Los Angeles courtroom

43:37.060 --> 43:40.663
"where Manson and his followers
were indicted on Friday,

43:40.729 --> 43:44.233
"a free concert in northern California

43:44.300 --> 43:47.436
"grew into a violent frenzy

43:47.503 --> 43:50.506
"that pitted armed men
against one another."

43:52.975 --> 43:54.510
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

44:02.085 --> 44:03.252
That was me.

44:05.421 --> 44:07.390
He did write a court story. I re-wrote it.

44:07.456 --> 44:09.925
What?

44:09.992 --> 44:11.094
Girls do not do re-writes.

44:11.127 --> 44:12.561
Why not?

44:12.628 --> 44:16.299
That's simply how we do things here.

44:16.365 --> 44:17.300
We have rules, protocol.

44:17.366 --> 44:18.567
Those rules are dumb.

44:18.634 --> 44:20.536
If copy's good, it's good.

44:23.172 --> 44:24.573
Young lady,

44:24.640 --> 44:27.376
you might not want to make waves.

44:27.443 --> 44:29.778
Lest we have doubts about
our decision to hire you.

44:29.845 --> 44:34.016
But you just said my
re-write hit the bull's eye.

44:34.117 --> 44:36.552
That was your word. "Bull's eye."

44:52.135 --> 44:53.302
Why is everyone standing around here

44:53.369 --> 44:56.339
like a bunch of carneys?

44:56.405 --> 44:57.373
Huh?

44:59.575 --> 45:02.478
Back to work.

45:02.545 --> 45:03.779
You, too, dear.

45:04.747 --> 45:05.881
Are you gonna run it?

45:07.816 --> 45:10.253
I'm gonna have one of my
reporters do a pass through.

45:10.319 --> 45:13.156
Why, if you like it as it is?

45:17.693 --> 45:20.263
Sweetheart,

45:20.329 --> 45:22.165
we do not change our modus operandi

45:22.231 --> 45:24.233
for one person.

45:24.300 --> 45:26.169
Now, clearly, you are a very talented...

45:26.169 --> 45:29.372
Clearly, I don't belong here.

45:29.438 --> 45:32.175
This is ridiculous.

45:32.175 --> 45:33.609
I quit.

45:36.179 --> 45:40.082
Well, you're name is all
you have in journalism.

45:40.183 --> 45:42.851
So, good luck, Nora Ephron.

45:48.491 --> 45:50.593
Get me a cup of coffee, will ya?

45:51.994 --> 45:54.096
One of you guys empty
these ashtrays in here.

45:54.197 --> 45:58.000
It's starting to smell like
a fucking gorilla's ass.

Okay.

47:07.803 --> 47:09.672
Ange, where's that file?

47:27.956 --> 47:28.924
Never mind.

47:30.293 --> 47:31.594
Now he asks me to stay late,

47:31.660 --> 47:33.729
and we do it in his office.

47:33.796 --> 47:37.300
But on Friday, I told him
I didn't want to anymore.

47:37.366 --> 47:38.634
You're asserting yourself.

47:38.701 --> 47:40.603
I'm sorry, there's no more room.

47:40.669 --> 47:43.406
Oh, uh, Nora told us to come.

47:43.472 --> 47:44.907
Um, Nora who?

47:44.973 --> 47:46.074
We'll find room someplace.

47:46.141 --> 47:47.376
He said if I break up with him,

47:47.443 --> 47:49.812
it will be too distracting for him at work,

47:49.878 --> 47:50.846
and...

47:54.417 --> 47:56.018
Keep going.

47:56.084 --> 47:59.422
Because once you can speak out
about the conditions of your life,

47:59.488 --> 48:01.424
then you can ask for change.

48:02.558 --> 48:04.226
We're listening. Right, ladies?

48:04.327 --> 48:05.594
- Yes.
- We are.

48:05.661 --> 48:09.598
- We're here for you.
- Absolutely.

48:09.665 --> 48:12.067
He said I'd have to leave the company.

48:12.134 --> 48:13.502
But I need this job.

48:13.569 --> 48:15.771
And when I asked if he'd
help me find other work,

48:15.838 --> 48:16.905
he got angry.

48:16.972 --> 48:18.641
This girl's having sex with her boss,

48:18.707 --> 48:20.409
and every time he's about to...

48:20.476 --> 48:22.478
you know, he whinnies.

48:22.545 --> 48:25.113
Like a horse.

48:25.180 --> 48:28.150
She would know. She
grew up on a horse farm.

48:28.216 --> 48:29.718
What are the chances?

48:29.785 --> 48:33.389
- But that's not true.
- No, it's not.

48:33.456 --> 48:34.457
Of course not.

48:34.523 --> 48:37.125
- Baked garlic?
- Oh, thank you.

48:37.192 --> 48:39.462
What do you want?

48:39.528 --> 48:43.231
Use that voice of yours. What do you want?

48:43.366 --> 48:45.368
Who is that?

48:45.401 --> 48:47.770
Eleanor Holmes Norton from the ACLU.

48:47.836 --> 48:48.804
Oh...

48:58.381 --> 48:59.715
I want to leave that job.

49:01.049 --> 49:02.651
That's right. There you go.

49:02.718 --> 49:05.788
See, there's so much support here for you.

49:05.854 --> 49:08.424
- For all of you.
- Right.

49:08.491 --> 49:10.859
Because when we stand united, ladies,

49:10.926 --> 49:12.160
we can do anything.

49:13.496 --> 49:14.430
- Right?
- That's right.

49:14.497 --> 49:15.598
Two better than one,

49:15.664 --> 49:17.400
and ten is definitely better than two.

49:17.400 --> 49:20.569
Right on, sister, right on!

49:23.906 --> 49:28.977
There are great changes
sweeping this country.

49:29.044 --> 49:32.848
And it is so important
that you're a part of it.

49:32.915 --> 49:34.817
Thank you, ladies.

49:39.522 --> 49:42.458
I'm Sheera from the
Women's Health Collective.

49:42.525 --> 49:43.692
I'm gonna go.

49:43.759 --> 49:45.260
- Oh, okay.
- How about this.

49:45.327 --> 49:49.898
Does anyone know what the
ideal female orgasm is?

49:54.503 --> 49:58.140
The ideal female orgasm is...

49:58.206 --> 49:59.875
you're own.

50:01.610 --> 50:04.179
Let's get out our compacts.

50:04.246 --> 50:05.981
Time to look at our vulvas.

50:07.215 --> 50:08.383
Do you want to stay?

50:08.451 --> 50:09.952
No.

50:14.957 --> 50:18.627
Oh, I am going to have
a lot to say about that.

50:18.694 --> 50:21.329
In about three days.

50:21.396 --> 50:22.565
Wow.

50:25.167 --> 50:27.636
Hey. Ned chose my cover.

50:32.541 --> 50:35.611
- Huh.
- By Sam Rosenberg.

50:35.678 --> 50:37.513
You know, maybe it is that

50:37.580 --> 50:40.483
I have been awake for 24 hours.

50:40.483 --> 50:41.884
Or maybe it's Nora quitting,

50:41.950 --> 50:45.320
but somehow everything feels different.

50:45.387 --> 50:47.322
Well, I haven't been up for 24 hours.

50:47.389 --> 50:50.559
Everything is different.

50:50.626 --> 50:52.828
You know, maybe things could change.

50:52.895 --> 50:55.598
At "News of the Week"?

50:55.664 --> 50:56.632
- Yeah.
- How?

50:56.699 --> 50:59.001
Maybe we could start something.

50:59.067 --> 51:00.402
No?

51:00.503 --> 51:03.205
Talk to some of the girls?

51:03.271 --> 51:04.306
Two are better than one,

51:04.372 --> 51:06.942
and 10 is better than two.

51:10.513 --> 51:11.514
Wait, Alex, Alex, before you go on,

51:11.514 --> 51:12.948
let me just... I agree.

51:13.015 --> 51:15.417
Look, Ryan's got a great
arm, but he's a kid.

51:15.518 --> 51:16.819
He's got no play...

51:16.885 --> 51:18.521
Oh, no, do I smell like garlic?

51:18.587 --> 51:19.988
Oh, if you do, I do.

51:20.055 --> 51:22.157
Look, let me tell you who the real star is.

51:22.224 --> 51:24.927
- It's Gil Hodges.
- You girls got some catching up to do.

51:24.993 --> 51:26.261
- Hey.
- We've been here for hours.

51:26.328 --> 51:28.096
Robinson.

51:28.163 --> 51:29.698
- Rosenberg.
- Hey.

51:31.299 --> 51:33.035
Robinson.

51:34.770 --> 51:36.071
Is there something I'm missing?

51:39.675 --> 51:41.209
How are you mad at me?

51:41.276 --> 51:44.547
I... I'm not mad at you.

51:46.348 --> 51:48.551
I'm frustrated.

51:48.617 --> 51:50.986
- Oh, you're frustrated.
- Yes.

51:51.053 --> 51:53.221
Well, I have the worst case of blue balls

51:53.288 --> 51:54.623
in the western hemisphere.

51:56.659 --> 51:59.995
Nora said you looked like
a real fox in you tux.

52:00.062 --> 52:02.097
Yeah, I sort of did.

52:03.866 --> 52:05.133
Hey.

52:05.200 --> 52:06.702
- Ooh.
- Oh.

52:06.769 --> 52:08.637
Well, to a helluva week. Huh?

52:08.704 --> 52:09.638
Messier than usual.

52:09.705 --> 52:11.206
Yeah, to a helluva week.

52:11.273 --> 52:12.775
Here's to that.

52:18.313 --> 52:20.583
Woo! Another?

52:20.649 --> 52:22.184
Two are better than one.

52:24.887 --> 52:26.622
Hey, where were you gals tonight?

52:28.156 --> 52:29.592
Oh, uh, um...

52:29.625 --> 52:31.259
We were at a meeting.

52:31.326 --> 52:33.596
What kind of a meeting?

52:33.662 --> 52:35.397
The kind where women take out compacts,

52:35.598 --> 52:37.199
and look at their vaginas.

52:40.102 --> 52:41.704
Well, I'm gonna need
that address immediately.
