            [woman sobs]        

00:11.278 --> 00:16.015
    Leave her. Do what you want 
  with me, but please leave her.

00:16.017 --> 00:18.283
      Please don't harm my baby.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.890
              [sobs]            

00:25.926 --> 00:28.193
              [screams]         

00:29.263 --> 00:31.997
              [gunfire]         

00:31.999 --> 00:33.365
    [man] Conway, stay with us! 

00:33.367 --> 00:36.368
      Stay with us, Conway!     
        Hug the trees!          

00:36.370 --> 00:37.770
      - Let's go, Mo! Let's go! 
          - I'm coming.         

00:37.772 --> 00:39.471
        [man] I got it.         
          I got you behind.     

00:39.473 --> 00:41.740
        [gunfire continues]     

00:42.710 --> 00:44.743
          For the mound!        

00:44.745 --> 00:47.179
      - [gunfire continues]     
            - Shit.             

00:50.985 --> 00:52.785
        - See anything?         
              - No.             

00:52.787 --> 00:55.354
    - Ollie, give me the radio. 
    - It's blown to shit, sarge.

00:55.356 --> 00:58.223
    - [Conway] Fucking hell.    
    - Throw down some smoke.    

00:58.225 --> 00:59.925
              Yes, sir.         

01:01.896 --> 01:03.929
    OK, heads up. Smoke out.    

01:04.665 --> 01:05.964
            Alright.            

01:05.966 --> 01:07.766
  Head for those tree lines, OK?

01:07.768 --> 01:11.570
      Two groups. Mo, you take  
the path on the left, on point. 

01:11.572 --> 01:14.373
      Conway in the middle.     
Swiftee, come on Conway's back. 

01:14.375 --> 01:16.442
              - OK.             
  - On my mark, first group go. 

01:16.444 --> 01:17.810
            - You ready?        
            - Yes, sir!         

01:17.812 --> 01:19.445
      OK. Move, move, move!     

01:19.447 --> 01:21.947
        Go, go, go, go, go!     
        Go, Conway, go!         

01:22.750 --> 01:24.483
            Go, go, go!         

01:26.687 --> 01:28.954
          - Go, go, go.         
            - OK, sir.          

01:32.326 --> 01:34.193
              - Go on!          
- Get a move on. Get a move on. 

01:34.195 --> 01:35.794
      I didn't see anything.    
          Did you, guv?         

01:35.796 --> 01:37.863
              Fuck all.         

01:40.034 --> 01:43.902
  Come on, come on, keep going. 
              Let's go.         

01:43.904 --> 01:46.438
  [Conway] There's a steep hill 
              up here.          

01:46.440 --> 01:48.540
            - Come on!          
      - Let's go, let's go!     

01:50.077 --> 01:53.479
  - Let's go. Get up that hill. 
      - Let's pick up the pace. 

01:57.551 --> 02:01.253
  - Guys, I've got an opening.  
- Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. 

02:06.327 --> 02:08.360
            - Anything?         
              - Uh-uh.          

02:08.362 --> 02:10.696
    I think I just swallowed    
          a fucking fly.        

02:10.698 --> 02:12.331
      OK, guys, take a breather.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.932
            [coughs]            

02:15.669 --> 02:18.003
          - OK, everyone OK?    
            - Yeah.             

02:18.005 --> 02:19.671
Fuck knows how we got out alive.

02:19.673 --> 02:23.175
        No moaning, Mum.        
    I've got my fucking vest on.

02:23.177 --> 02:25.377
        - That's my boy.        
              - Alright.        

02:25.379 --> 02:28.514
    - You're OK, you're OK.     
            - Alright!          

02:28.516 --> 02:30.883
      OK, we move out east.     

02:30.885 --> 02:33.819
We keep in cover of those trees.
      In the same order. Ready? 

02:33.821 --> 02:35.754
            - Yes, sir.         
    - OK, let's do this. Go!    

02:35.756 --> 02:38.357
    Go, boys. Over you get.     
      Let's go. Over we go.     

02:38.359 --> 02:40.692
        Go, go, go! Come on.    

02:41.762 --> 02:44.963
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. And go.

02:46.700 --> 02:48.233
        - You see anything?     
              - No.             

02:48.235 --> 02:49.401
            - Anything?         
              - No.             

02:49.403 --> 02:50.636
      OK. Everybody on my back. 

02:50.638 --> 02:52.004
    We're going forward, OK?    

02:52.006 --> 02:54.273
        Let's go, let's go.     

02:56.877 --> 02:58.944
          Sir. Up here.         

03:01.048 --> 03:03.315
              Which way?        

03:04.685 --> 03:07.553
      We'll go right. Let's go.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.702
          What the fuck         
        is all this, sarge?     

03:23.704 --> 03:25.671
        British engineering,    
            that's what.        

03:25.673 --> 03:28.307
        Leftovers from          
      the first Afghan war.     

03:28.309 --> 03:29.875
      Silly sods in Westminster 

03:29.877 --> 03:32.477
      have been sending us back 
            ever since.         

03:33.948 --> 03:36.682
          Swiftee, Swiftee,     
      go with him, go with him. 

03:51.165 --> 03:53.198
    [Swiftee] You didn't sign up
          for this, Conway.     

03:53.200 --> 03:54.633
      [Conway] I'm alright.     

03:54.635 --> 03:55.901
              [chuckles]        

03:56.537 --> 03:58.804
          Split, split.         

05:21.088 --> 05:23.889
        They're Brits, sir,     
      and they've found a door. 

05:26.393 --> 05:28.226
      Let's go, let's go. Yeah? 

05:28.228 --> 05:30.495
        Right, in front.        

05:33.200 --> 05:35.467
              Follow me.        

05:45.979 --> 05:48.046
          Yes, yes, go.         

05:51.652 --> 05:54.486
      Go on, Swiftee, quick. Go.

05:55.289 --> 05:57.556
    OK, Mo, cover the door.     

06:01.628 --> 06:03.895
        Mo, you stay there.     

06:04.698 --> 06:07.733
        We're clear? Clear?     

06:07.735 --> 06:10.135
          - Last person in.     
        - In here. Go.          

06:10.137 --> 06:12.204
        Cover those stairs.     

06:13.907 --> 06:17.676
- Where the fuck have they gone?
- There was five of 'em. Brits. 

06:17.678 --> 06:20.245
        - Seen anything?        
    - [Conway] Nothing, guv.    

06:20.247 --> 06:24.649
          - All quiet.          
  - I say we take these stairs. 

07:15.636 --> 07:17.302
            - We clear?         
          - We're clear.        

07:17.304 --> 07:19.004
              - OK.             
            - Clear.            

07:19.006 --> 07:21.740
              - Clear?          
        - Right side clear.     

07:29.783 --> 07:31.283
What's with the Tony Blair mask?

07:31.285 --> 07:33.885
    Some of the lads put 'em    
      on dead Terry the Ts.     

07:43.230 --> 07:45.297
              Come here.        

07:53.807 --> 07:58.677
    Right, I want you to see    
        if you can find         

07:58.679 --> 08:00.745
    those other British troops. 

08:08.922 --> 08:13.258
    [Ollie] Where are you, boys?
      We definitely saw you.    

08:21.635 --> 08:23.902
              Jesus.            

08:40.888 --> 08:43.154
          Fucking hell.         

08:48.362 --> 08:50.362
              [chuckles]        

08:50.364 --> 08:52.631
                Ah.             

08:54.801 --> 08:57.402
Fucking hell. Why am I laughing?

08:58.305 --> 09:00.305
      This just isn't funny.    

09:01.275 --> 09:03.341
            Oh, fuck it.        

09:05.812 --> 09:08.079
            Oh, fuck it.        

09:13.220 --> 09:15.287
          Fucking clear.        

09:18.058 --> 09:21.192
  - Where the hell are you guys?
        - [distant gunfire]     

09:21.194 --> 09:23.495
  For fuck's sake. Do they know 
      it's time to go home?     

09:23.497 --> 09:26.831
              [gunshots]        

09:28.602 --> 09:31.369
            - [gunshot]         
            - Hold it.          

09:33.206 --> 09:35.473
          They must run low     
          on ammo too, huh?     

09:35.475 --> 09:38.777
    - Alright, Ollie, ammo.     
      <i> - I haven't got it, boss.</i>

09:38.779 --> 09:42.314
    - Who's got the ammo pouch? 
    - I gave it to Conway, boss.

09:44.084 --> 09:48.153
      Shit. Must have dropped it
        back out there.         

09:48.155 --> 09:51.456
    - Oh, for fuck's sake.      
    - You know the score, then. 

09:51.458 --> 09:54.793
          Reserve ammo,         
one shot, one kill and all that.

09:56.263 --> 09:58.296
    [Conway] Can someone give me
          a fucking bayonet?    

09:58.298 --> 10:01.132
        - Pistol'll do fine.    
      - Here, take mine as well.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.437
    - It's got a full clip.     
          - Thank you.          

10:05.439 --> 10:07.606
    Try not to fucking lose it. 
          It was my dad's.      

10:07.608 --> 10:10.842
[Swiftee] Nothing like a fucking
  babe with a gun to turn me on.

10:10.844 --> 10:13.244
              - Eh?             
            - Swiftee...        

10:13.246 --> 10:14.813
        If you call me babe     
        one more time,          

10:14.815 --> 10:17.182
          I'm gonna cut         
    your fucking balls off.     

10:17.184 --> 10:19.918
  Remember I'm a nurse, alright?
            Snip, snip?         

10:19.920 --> 10:22.320
            - [laughter]        
      - Alright, stay alert.    

10:23.757 --> 10:26.157
[Ollie] I can see the ammo bag, 
  boss. It's about 20 feet out. 

10:26.159 --> 10:29.060
        - I'm going for it.     
<i> - Stay where you are, sergeant.</i>

10:38.772 --> 10:41.039
              [gunfire]         

10:41.908 --> 10:44.175
            Fuck, fuck.         

10:45.345 --> 10:47.512
        Bollocks. Fuck.         

10:47.514 --> 10:49.147
    All that fucking money.     

10:49.149 --> 10:52.350
  Feeling nearly had. Bastards. 

10:52.352 --> 10:53.785
            - Whoa!             
        - It's Mo. It's me.     

10:53.787 --> 10:55.987
  Fuck, Mo. Don't do that to me.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.023
              - You OK?         
  - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm good. 

10:58.025 --> 11:00.425
    Don't you ever disobey      
  a direct order from me again. 

11:00.427 --> 11:03.328
      Jesus, Captain, chill.    
      I didn't fucking hear you.

11:04.031 --> 11:06.798
      Like fuck you didn't.     

11:06.800 --> 11:09.734
      - Where's this ammo?      
    - There is no fucking ammo. 

11:09.736 --> 11:14.339
There's just hundreds, thousands
    of fucking American dollars.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.674
            No ammo.            

11:15.676 --> 11:17.876
        You really left         
    all that money behind, yeah?

11:17.878 --> 11:19.144
              What?             

11:19.146 --> 11:20.812
You really expect us to believe 

11:20.814 --> 11:22.347
            you left            
  all that fucking money behind?

11:22.349 --> 11:24.683
    Do you think I'm fucking    
    storing it in my helmet?    

11:24.685 --> 11:26.317
      Just shut the fuck up.    

11:26.319 --> 11:28.586
        - Shut the fuck up!     
  - Don't talk to me like that. 

11:28.588 --> 11:31.923
        I don't give a fuck     
      what was in that bag.     

11:31.925 --> 11:34.292
          Bottom line is        
      we still have no ammo.    

11:37.164 --> 11:39.564
        Got about 15 minutes    
          until sunset.         

11:39.566 --> 11:43.201
  Right, we'll hunker down and  
we'll sneak out when it's dark. 

11:43.203 --> 11:44.803
    Right, you stay on the door.

11:44.805 --> 11:47.439
  You two back in the main room.
      And you come with me.     

11:47.441 --> 11:49.107
    Don't fucking talk to me    
        like that again.        

11:49.109 --> 11:51.376
              - Now!            
- I will fucking come after you.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.445
          Cheeky fucker.        

12:06.126 --> 12:08.860
    I don't fucking get it.     

12:08.862 --> 12:10.662
      Well, I saw them come in. 

12:10.664 --> 12:13.131
      You saw them come in.     
    So where the fuck are they? 

12:13.133 --> 12:16.000
        Don't ask me, boss.     
    I've looked everywhere.     

12:16.002 --> 12:17.602
          And nothing. Nada.    

12:17.604 --> 12:19.471
          I mean, this place    
          is a fucking maze.    

12:19.473 --> 12:21.873
          But they can't        
      just have disappeared.    

12:21.875 --> 12:23.641
  There must be another way out.

12:23.643 --> 12:25.443
      Which means there must be 
        another way in.         

12:25.445 --> 12:28.947
          You're right.         
  Soldiers don't just evaporate.

12:32.385 --> 12:35.120
          They must have        
          fucking legged it.    

12:35.122 --> 12:37.555
      We're probably bringing in
          too much heat.        

12:43.697 --> 12:47.966
Fuck! Swiftee, for fuck's sake. 
        What are you doing?     

12:47.968 --> 12:49.734
I was just looking for somewhere
        to take a shit.         

12:49.736 --> 12:51.469
      Go and find somewhere else
        to take a shit.         

12:51.471 --> 12:53.104
        Does this look like     
        a shit-hole to you?     

12:53.106 --> 12:55.240
      With all due respect, sir,

12:55.242 --> 12:57.542
    this country is a shit-hole.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.577
              [laughter]        

12:59.579 --> 13:04.549
        [captain] Come on,      
      back to your post, buddy. 

13:04.551 --> 13:07.786
[Ollie] Oh, by the way, I found 
    a genny, and it's got fuel. 

13:07.788 --> 13:09.821
  [captain] Light this place up 
    like a Christmas tree.      

13:09.823 --> 13:12.624
  [Ollie] Makes it easier to see
        the boogie men, sir.    

13:12.626 --> 13:14.893
              [laughter]        

13:19.966 --> 13:22.200
      [Swiftee] A place this big
    and nobody even bothered    

13:22.202 --> 13:24.469
      to build a fucking toilet.

13:25.071 --> 13:27.338
          Fuck me, man.         

15:47.847 --> 15:49.280
        [grating noise]         

15:49.282 --> 15:51.015
              Holy fuck.        

15:51.017 --> 15:53.284
            [yells]             

15:56.656 --> 15:58.890
            [spits]             

15:58.892 --> 16:01.159
            [coughs]            

16:18.078 --> 16:20.345
          What the fuck?        

16:30.991 --> 16:33.257
          What the fuck?        

16:35.528 --> 16:38.329
        - [radio static]        
              - Captain?        

16:39.666 --> 16:42.533
    Can anybody hear me? Sarge? 

16:42.535 --> 16:44.902
  I'm at the end of the corridor
      if youse can hear me.     

16:48.475 --> 16:51.209
        - [radio static]        
              - Captain?        

16:51.211 --> 16:53.745
  Sergeant? Can anybody hear me?

16:53.747 --> 16:56.681
I'm at the end of the corridor. 
      Can anybody hear me?      

17:00.387 --> 17:03.054
  Identify yourself! Who is it? 

17:03.056 --> 17:05.123
          It's us. It's me.     

17:06.559 --> 17:09.227
          - What happened?      
      - [Swiftee] Fucking hell. 

17:09.229 --> 17:12.130
          Someone opened        
          that fucking door.    

17:12.132 --> 17:13.531
          Someone what?         

17:13.532 --> 17:15.165
          Someone opened        
          that fucking door.    

17:15.167 --> 17:18.903
  I've cleared this whole place.
        There's no one here.    

17:18.905 --> 17:21.071
      I knew you'd come in handy
            one day.            

17:21.074 --> 17:22.640
              [chuckles]        

17:22.642 --> 17:24.608
[Ollie] Well, this puts us back 
        in the game, boss.      

17:24.611 --> 17:26.810
        - Aye, it does.         
    - Where the fuck were youse?

17:26.813 --> 17:29.013
              - Huh?            
      - Where the fuck were you?

17:29.015 --> 17:31.616
  I wasn't coming near you, out 
  looking for somewhere to shit.

17:31.618 --> 17:34.886
    - You didn't open that door?
              - No.             

17:34.888 --> 17:36.654
            - What?             
            - Chill out.        

17:36.656 --> 17:38.956
      [captain] I've cleared    
          this whole place.     

17:38.958 --> 17:43.161
    - Nice. A bit of light.     
      - [Ollie] What's in here? 

17:43.163 --> 17:46.697
      - [Swiftee] I don't know. 
      - [Ollie] Then open it up.

17:57.577 --> 18:01.279
          - [Ollie chuckles]    
      - [Swiftee] What the fuck?

18:01.281 --> 18:03.047
              - Boy!            
  - [Ollie] What about this one?

18:03.049 --> 18:06.384
  - [captain] Boys, boys, boys. 
- [Swiftee] Well, open it, then.

18:12.225 --> 18:13.958
          Fucking hell.         

18:13.960 --> 18:17.328
      Fucking hell! There's     
      fucking money everywhere! 

18:17.330 --> 18:19.597
              [laughter]        

18:20.200 --> 18:21.766
            Fuck me.            

18:21.768 --> 18:24.535
        - Fucking fuck.         
        - We are rich, boys.    

18:24.537 --> 18:28.072
          - What the fuck?      
        - Oh, Jesus Christ.     

18:28.074 --> 18:32.777
    That is fucking incredible. 

18:32.779 --> 18:35.413
  - What the fuck do we do now? 
    - Fucking hold it together. 

18:35.415 --> 18:38.149
        That's what you do.     

18:38.151 --> 18:39.383
      - Hold your arms out.     
            - What?             

18:39.385 --> 18:41.352
        Hold your arms out.     

18:42.255 --> 18:44.522
    What are you thinking, cap? 

18:45.358 --> 18:46.824
            Take these,         

18:46.826 --> 18:48.960
      and go back and give them 
        to the others.          

18:48.962 --> 18:51.262
And keep your fucking mouth shut
        about this, OK?         

18:51.264 --> 18:53.164
            - Yeah.             
      - Alright, off you go.    

18:53.166 --> 18:54.165
                OK.             

18:57.437 --> 18:59.537
            Go on, then.        

18:59.539 --> 19:01.639
        What are we gonna do    
          with all this?        

19:02.542 --> 19:03.774
It's a hundred million dollars. 

19:03.776 --> 19:05.710
      A hundred million dollars.

19:05.712 --> 19:08.946
        That's what I call      
    a fucking army pension.     

19:08.948 --> 19:11.182
              Pull out,         
      head back to the cop.     

19:11.184 --> 19:12.884
    When I get a couple of LRs, 

19:12.886 --> 19:14.685
          we come back here     
    under the cover of darkness,

19:14.687 --> 19:16.854
    take the money, fuck off    
  over the border to Uzbekistan.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.823
        - There you go.         
              - [sighs]         

19:18.825 --> 19:21.726
          We'd be on the run    
      for the rest of our lives.

19:21.728 --> 19:25.096
      No. We get the others     
          in on it too.         

19:25.098 --> 19:28.132
  Bring 'em back with the LRs,  
  and once we've got the money, 

19:28.134 --> 19:31.269
      we just fucking kill 'em, 
mash up their bodies, burn 'em, 

19:31.271 --> 19:34.138
    stick our ID tags on Mo     
  and Swiftee, Bob's your uncle.

19:34.140 --> 19:37.375
  Fucking footballers' lifestyle
          here we come.         

19:38.378 --> 19:40.511
          Shit, Ollie,          
    we fucking earned this.     

19:40.513 --> 19:43.181
    You've fucking lost it,     
          haven't you?          

19:43.183 --> 19:45.616
          You've completely     
          fucking lost it.      

19:45.618 --> 19:48.452
  - We can't kill our own lads. 
          - You know what?      

19:51.124 --> 19:53.324
          I really thought      
        you were different.     

19:54.827 --> 20:00.264
  I really thought you were just
    gonna fucking fall for that.

20:00.266 --> 20:03.100
        You should have seen    
          your fucking face.    

20:03.102 --> 20:05.069
    You looked like a right mog.

20:06.472 --> 20:09.473
      The money's not gonna     
      keep us alive, is it?     

20:09.475 --> 20:13.578
Midnight, that's in seven hours,

20:13.580 --> 20:15.613
          this war ends.        

20:15.615 --> 20:17.748
        Yours and my job        
    for the next seven hours    

20:17.750 --> 20:20.718
  is to keep our personnel safe 
and get them home in one piece. 

20:20.720 --> 20:23.387
        - Do you understand?    
            - Yeah.             

20:23.389 --> 20:26.791
    I am fucking sick and tired 

20:26.793 --> 20:28.326
          of looking at         
      all those empty seats     

20:28.328 --> 20:30.127
          on the plane          
    at the end of the tour.     

20:30.129 --> 20:32.630
    It's already happened on my 
watch. It ain't happening again.

20:32.632 --> 20:35.333
          - You get it?         
            - Yes.              

20:35.335 --> 20:37.335
              I do.             

20:37.337 --> 20:40.638
    Pull your fucking socks up. 
      Let's go find the others. 

21:00.793 --> 21:02.426
      [Conway] Did you do that? 

21:02.428 --> 21:05.763
    [Swiftee] Must have been    
    the cap or the sergeant.    

21:05.765 --> 21:10.368
      - Where did you get those?
    - Oi. Go and relieve Mo.    

21:10.370 --> 21:11.769
      - He's up on the door.    
        - Yes, sergeant.        

21:11.771 --> 21:13.704
      Give me one of those.     
            Off you go.         

21:13.706 --> 21:15.473
            - Run along.        
              - OK.             

21:16.342 --> 21:18.843
    Conway, a little prezzie    
            for you.            

21:20.146 --> 21:22.613
      - Ever fired one of these?
            - No, sarge.        

21:22.615 --> 21:25.216
        No? Don't worry,        
          it's child's play.    

21:25.218 --> 21:26.851
            Sad fact            
    proven by child soldiers    

21:26.853 --> 21:29.086
  all over this fucked-up world.

21:35.695 --> 21:38.996
      - Mo. Where's Swiftee?    
    - He's gone to find the cap.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.767
            Swiftee?            

21:44.170 --> 21:45.536
            Swiftee?            

21:45.538 --> 21:47.605
Where are you, you little runt? 

22:05.692 --> 22:07.425
          You fucking snidey    
        little bastard.         

22:07.427 --> 22:09.894
          I knew he'd pinch     
        some fucking money.     

22:15.635 --> 22:17.902
            - [clanging]        
            - Fuck!             

22:19.072 --> 22:22.506
    What the fuck was that?     
          Jesus Christ.         

22:29.482 --> 22:31.749
          What the fuck?        

22:37.156 --> 22:38.956
            Swiftee!            

22:41.594 --> 22:42.993
            [explosion]         

22:42.995 --> 22:44.628
        - Fuck. Go, go, go!     
            - Let's go.         

22:44.630 --> 22:46.864
        Let's go, let's go.     

22:46.866 --> 22:47.932
            Conway!             

22:50.503 --> 22:52.069
              - Conway!         
              - You OK?         

22:52.071 --> 22:54.605
          Where are you?        

22:54.607 --> 22:57.174
    - You alright, darling?     
          - Is she OK?          

22:57.176 --> 22:58.976
          - You alright?        
          - [Conway] I'm OK.    

22:58.978 --> 23:01.312
  [captain] Mo, take over here. 
    Ollie, give me a hand.      

23:01.314 --> 23:03.647
          [Conway] Don't try    
          to cop a feel.        

23:03.649 --> 23:06.250
          - Give her to me.     
      - Guys, come on, let's go.

23:06.252 --> 23:08.252
            - Come on.          
          - Hold her there.     

23:08.254 --> 23:11.122
OK, OK. Take her over here. Go. 

23:11.124 --> 23:14.325
          [muffled] You OK?     
          Can you hear me?      

23:14.327 --> 23:17.128
  - She's deaf. She can't hear. 
        - OK, come on.          

23:17.130 --> 23:19.830
        This way. Come on.      
  This way. Come on. Follow me. 

23:19.832 --> 23:21.932
    You're gonna be OK, Conway. 
        You're gonna be OK.     

23:21.934 --> 23:24.535
      Guys, bring her down here,
        bring her down here.    

23:24.537 --> 23:28.172
      - Put her down there.     
    - There you go. On the wall.

23:28.174 --> 23:30.641
      Look at me. You're OK.    
        It's me. It's Swift.    

23:30.643 --> 23:33.744
    It's Swift. Are you alright?
          It's me, alright?     

23:33.746 --> 23:35.679
    It's me. Look, it's me.     

23:36.649 --> 23:38.649
            OK? You OK?         

23:38.651 --> 23:42.319
              You OK            
  Are you bleeding anywhere? No?

23:42.321 --> 23:44.622
  Jesus. That shit me right up. 

23:44.624 --> 23:46.657
      You must have the biggest 
        rabbit's foot ever.     

23:46.659 --> 23:49.226
      There's not a mark on you.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.362
        Oh, no, shut up.        

23:51.364 --> 23:54.465
            - [laughter]        
        - How lucky is that?    

23:54.467 --> 23:56.801
  [Swiftee] Don't think it ended
    too well for the rabbit.    

23:56.803 --> 23:59.603
      Look at me. What happened?

23:59.605 --> 24:01.739
      I don't know, Captain.    

24:01.741 --> 24:04.775
        Uh, just nothing        
      and then there was a bang.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.677
            Alright, Mo,        
      keep your eyes peeled.    

24:06.679 --> 24:09.513
    You keep an eye on her.     
    Ollie, you're with me.      

24:09.515 --> 24:10.815
              Let's go.         

24:10.817 --> 24:13.250
              After you.        

24:13.252 --> 24:15.319
              [gunfire]         

24:20.193 --> 24:22.193
              - Mo!             
            - Here.             

24:23.663 --> 24:25.863
      Captain, I need a mag.    

24:25.865 --> 24:28.132
        [gunfire continues]     

24:30.837 --> 24:33.103
        [gunfire continues]     

24:36.008 --> 24:39.109
      [Conway] Why do they keep 
            doing that?         

24:39.111 --> 24:42.379
  They like to let off a couple 
of pot shots from time to time, 

24:42.381 --> 24:46.484
        keep us on our feet,    
try and make us use up our ammo.

24:46.486 --> 24:50.821
    Why don't they just go home,
      wait for us to leave?     

24:52.258 --> 24:54.325
      Could be a few young rags 
        looking to chop off     

24:54.327 --> 24:56.560
          a few more heads.     

24:56.562 --> 24:58.963
    And then we fuck off and... 

24:58.965 --> 25:01.765
  they start killing each other 
        all over again.         

25:03.169 --> 25:05.936
          God, it's all         
      so fucking pointless.     

25:07.206 --> 25:10.107
      Tell that to the boys     
          in the body bags.     

25:11.410 --> 25:13.377
God's got nothing to do with it.

25:15.147 --> 25:19.817
      We have to keep fighting  
      to keep each other alive. 

25:20.987 --> 25:23.254
        We have to watch        
          each other's back.    

25:24.690 --> 25:26.757
  That's what this is all about.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.626
              Yeah?             

25:28.628 --> 25:30.461
        [Swiftee sighs]         

25:30.463 --> 25:32.563
        Speaking of keeping     
          each other alive,     

25:32.565 --> 25:33.931
  I need to get some more ammo. 

25:33.933 --> 25:35.466
          - What about you?     
        - No, I'm good.         

25:35.468 --> 25:37.334
              You sure?         

25:37.336 --> 25:41.372
    [sighs] I better get going. 
      I'll see you later, yeah? 

25:56.522 --> 25:59.623
  Fuck 'em if they think they're
      getting any of this money.

25:59.625 --> 26:01.892
      It's fucking my money.    

26:07.400 --> 26:09.667
              [clanging]        

26:13.272 --> 26:15.339
              [clanging]        

26:26.752 --> 26:29.019
              [clanging]        

26:35.962 --> 26:38.228
              [clanging]        

26:50.676 --> 26:53.277
            - [thudding]        
              - [yells]         

26:54.480 --> 26:56.246
            You OK?             

27:02.355 --> 27:04.021
          What the fuck         
      you doing in there anyway?

27:04.023 --> 27:06.857
      I was, um... getting ammo.

27:08.761 --> 27:11.028
          Go back to Conway.    

27:11.931 --> 27:14.198
          Yes, Captain.         

27:17.770 --> 27:19.503
Do you see, back there, alright,

27:19.505 --> 27:23.741
    behind all the ammo, right, 
    there's a packing case.     

27:23.743 --> 27:28.045
There must be, what, a fucking  
hundred million dollars, right, 

27:28.047 --> 27:31.115
  in hundred-dollar bills, yeah?

27:31.117 --> 27:32.616
Yeah. Pull the other one, mate. 

27:32.618 --> 27:33.984
Look, mate, I'm fucking serious.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.386
            Look, mate,         
      I'm serious, alright?     

27:35.388 --> 27:37.988
    And what's more, right,     
          what's more,          

27:37.990 --> 27:39.490
        is that the captain     
          and the sergeant,     

27:39.492 --> 27:41.225
          they wanna keep it    
        for themselves.         

27:41.227 --> 27:42.726
        That's not true.        

27:42.728 --> 27:45.229
    Why else would they not tell
    you and Conway about it?    

27:45.231 --> 27:46.930
    You're just so full of shit,
            mama's boy.         

27:46.932 --> 27:50.100
  Look, look. Look at me, right?

27:51.537 --> 27:54.138
Go and have a look for yourself.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.906
    I'll fucking watch here.    

27:55.908 --> 27:57.875
        Go and have a...        
Go and have a look for yourself.

27:57.877 --> 27:59.309
        You better not          
        be bullshitting me.     

27:59.311 --> 28:02.246
      I'm not, I swear to fuck. 

28:05.851 --> 28:09.319
  Sarge is gonna have my balls  
if he finds out I left my post. 

28:10.189 --> 28:13.190
    I swear. I swear on my life.

28:40.686 --> 28:43.320
              [captain]         
      A hundred million dollars.

28:43.322 --> 28:45.022
      A hundred million dollars.

28:45.024 --> 28:47.558
        That's what I call      
    a fucking army pension.     

28:48.594 --> 28:50.627
Pull out, head back to the cop. 

28:50.629 --> 28:52.329
    When I get a couple of LRs, 

28:52.331 --> 28:54.131
          we come back here     
    under the cover of darkness,

28:54.133 --> 28:56.233
    take the money, fuck off    
  over the border to Uzbekistan.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.235
        - There you go.         
              - [sighs]         

28:58.237 --> 29:01.171
          We'd be on the run    
      for the rest of our lives.

29:01.173 --> 29:04.541
      No. We get the others     
          in on it too.         

29:04.543 --> 29:07.544
  Bring 'em back with the LRs,  
  and once we've got the money, 

29:07.546 --> 29:10.681
      we just fucking kill 'em, 
mash up their bodies, burn 'em, 

29:10.683 --> 29:13.550
    stick our ID tags on Mo     
  and Swiftee, Bob's your uncle.

29:13.552 --> 29:16.386
  Fucking footballers' lifestyle
          here we come.         

29:43.682 --> 29:45.082
  What are you doing off guard? 

29:48.454 --> 29:50.554
              [yelling]         

29:53.793 --> 29:56.326
  - Swiftee's holding the fort. 
    - Get back and relieve him. 

29:56.328 --> 29:59.229
      - Send him down to Conway.
          - Yes, sarge.         

30:00.733 --> 30:03.000
      - You were fucking right. 
          - [Swiftee] What?     

30:03.002 --> 30:04.701
      And on top of it all      
      they're gonna top us.     

30:04.703 --> 30:07.237
  - What are you talking about? 
  - A hundred million dollars.  

30:07.239 --> 30:09.173
      You'd top your own grandma
      for a hundred million.    

30:09.175 --> 30:10.507
          - No, I wouldn't.     
              - OK.             

30:10.509 --> 30:12.242
      Well, you wouldn't top    
          your grandma,         

30:12.244 --> 30:14.545
      but I bet you'd top mine. 

30:14.547 --> 30:16.647
      They're gonna tell us     
    once we're back at the cop. 

30:16.649 --> 30:19.316
Then we're gonna come back here 
    and they're gonna to do it. 

30:19.318 --> 30:22.452
          Look, we all got      
    that money together, right? 

30:22.454 --> 30:24.254
          It should be equal    
        fucking shares.         

30:24.256 --> 30:25.756
      And, I'm telling you,     
          what we should do     

30:25.758 --> 30:27.791
          is we should take     
    the equal fucking shares    

30:27.793 --> 30:29.326
      and we should do a runner.

30:30.763 --> 30:32.896
          I'll go with you      
      on the equal shares plan, 

30:32.898 --> 30:38.035
    but the rest, I don't know, 
    maybe I just misheard.      

30:38.838 --> 30:40.671
        I'm warning you,        

30:40.673 --> 30:43.173
    they're gonna stick a bullet
      in the back of your head. 

30:43.175 --> 30:44.708
You understand that, don't you? 

30:47.479 --> 30:51.415
    Mind the door. I'm gonna go 
  tell Conway what's happening. 

30:56.989 --> 30:59.756
      [captain] Found anything? 

30:59.758 --> 31:01.859
  Well, found another staircase.

31:01.861 --> 31:06.430
    I think it goes to the sky. 
        Could be a way out.     

31:06.432 --> 31:08.365
We need to go and check it out. 

31:08.367 --> 31:09.967
                OK.             

31:13.672 --> 31:17.507
      [Swiftee] Do you know     
  where the cap and sergeant is?

31:17.509 --> 31:18.575
                No.             

31:23.682 --> 31:26.383
          Sit down with me.     
      I wanna ask you something.

31:30.990 --> 31:33.023
  Do you wanna make some money? 

31:34.927 --> 31:37.394
          What kind of girl     
        do you take me for?     

31:39.465 --> 31:41.031
  Have you been at the morphine?

31:41.033 --> 31:42.799
            There's             
      a hundred million dollars,

31:42.801 --> 31:45.535
  and guns and ammo, at the top 
    of that fucking staircase.  

31:45.537 --> 31:49.439
          - You shitting me?    
              - No.             

31:49.441 --> 31:53.677
  And Paolo and Ollie are gonna 
  fucking do a runner with it.  

31:55.314 --> 31:57.447
        But I've got a plan.    

31:57.449 --> 32:00.150
        - You've got a plan?    
            - Yeah.             

32:00.152 --> 32:01.685
              Great.            
      You've got a fucking plan.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.987
        Look, just leave me     
        out of it, alright?     

32:03.989 --> 32:06.123
          All I wanna do        
    is get home in one piece    

32:06.125 --> 32:08.625
      to my baby and my husband.

32:10.763 --> 32:12.729
          You've got a baby?    

32:12.731 --> 32:15.699
      Yeah. What, did you think 
      I was a dyke or something?

32:17.102 --> 32:20.203
      Even lesbians have babies,
      for your information.     

32:20.205 --> 32:22.339
  I just don't happen to be one.

32:23.742 --> 32:27.978
          Do what you want,     
  but if you endanger the unit, 

32:27.980 --> 32:30.781
        I will shoot you        
        my fucking self.        

32:32.651 --> 32:37.254
              OK. Well,         
you fucking suit yourself, yeah?

32:37.256 --> 32:39.356
          [distant yelling]     

32:41.660 --> 32:43.727
            Hang on.            

32:48.801 --> 32:51.068
I hope it's not a fucking clown.

32:52.404 --> 32:56.006
      I fucking hate clowns.    
  My great-granddad was a clown.

32:56.008 --> 32:58.542
        And he was so shit      
  that they fucking hanged him. 

33:00.679 --> 33:02.913
    Are you sure you've not been
        at the morphine?        

33:02.915 --> 33:05.515
      I'm gonna go and see      
      if Mo heard anything.     

33:27.106 --> 33:29.373
  [Conway] Swiftee, is that you?

33:34.013 --> 33:36.380
        - [radio static]        
            - Sarge?            

33:36.382 --> 33:38.882
        - [radio static]        
              - Captain?        

33:40.185 --> 33:42.452
              [screams]         

33:46.258 --> 33:48.492
          - Where's Conway?     
            - Fuck.             

33:48.494 --> 33:49.993
  Mo, you get back on your post.

33:49.995 --> 33:51.928
      Ollie, you and Swiftee    
        go and look for her.    

33:51.930 --> 33:54.231
            - Yes, cap.         
            - Move.             

34:05.811 --> 34:07.044
              Fuck.             

34:07.046 --> 34:09.346
      You made me jump, sir.    

34:09.348 --> 34:11.114
    Any movement out there?     

34:11.116 --> 34:14.284
      The odd possible contact, 
but nothing that could be IDed. 

34:14.286 --> 34:16.152
            Alright. OK.        

34:16.155 --> 34:18.989
  On my mark, I want you to lay 
down some cover, right to left, 

34:18.991 --> 34:21.257
        see if anything         
  comes out the woodwork, yeah? 

34:21.260 --> 34:25.661
            - Yes, sir.         
          - OK. Doing fine.     

34:25.664 --> 34:28.632
            You show me         
        the staircase, yeah?    

34:28.634 --> 34:30.900
          Give it some, boy.    

34:32.004 --> 34:34.271
              [gunfire]         

34:47.018 --> 34:49.286
            Is this it?         

34:50.422 --> 34:51.755
          Fucking hell.         

34:57.162 --> 35:00.831
      Let's not fuck about.     
    Let's go take a look, yeah? 

35:02.067 --> 35:04.734
        Captain, get back,      
        get back, get back!     

35:06.338 --> 35:08.405
              Move back.        

35:09.274 --> 35:10.407
      There's someone there.    

35:10.409 --> 35:12.342
    Someone is fucking watching.

35:21.920 --> 35:23.787
            No. Nothing.        

35:24.890 --> 35:27.624
              Fuck.             
    Something was fucking there.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.426
      - I don't like this.      
    - You fucking having me on? 

35:29.428 --> 35:30.961
    No, it was there. I saw it. 

35:30.963 --> 35:32.796
            Yeah, well,         
  you're fucking seeing things. 

35:32.798 --> 35:35.232
        [Ollie] Yeah, well,     
    I fucking am, actually.     

35:35.234 --> 35:36.833
        Strange things.         

35:36.835 --> 35:39.369
- Where the fuck are you going? 
            - Come on.          

35:50.883 --> 35:52.883
    [Swiftee] What was all that 
      fucking firing about?     

35:52.885 --> 35:55.418
      Wake-up fire. They've gone
    to find some staircase.     

35:55.420 --> 35:57.087
        Right, well, look,      
    now's our chance to go.     

35:57.089 --> 36:00.056
        - What do you mean?     
    - We grab the fucking money.

36:00.058 --> 36:02.359
  We grab as much fucking money 
    as we can and we split.     

36:02.361 --> 36:04.027
          What about Conway?    

36:04.029 --> 36:06.429
          You're not getting    
  all fucking soppy on me again?

36:06.431 --> 36:07.964
          Have you got          
  a fucking love thing for her? 

36:07.966 --> 36:10.100
        - Fuck off, man.        
  - Yeah, well, hard luck, mate.

36:10.102 --> 36:12.469
    She's got a fucking husband 
        and a kid at home.      

36:12.471 --> 36:14.938
        Look, I don't know      
    about this anymore, OK?     

36:14.940 --> 36:16.740
        You're talking about    
          splitting on them.    

36:16.742 --> 36:19.009
    Yeah, well, look, mate,     
    you fucking heard them, OK? 

36:19.011 --> 36:22.512
They wanna shoot us in the back 
      and fucking burn us.      

36:22.514 --> 36:25.782
I don't understand why we don't 
    just fucking kill them.     

36:25.784 --> 36:28.151
            - What?             
    - Terry the T takes the hit.

36:28.153 --> 36:31.821
      Alright? By that time     
  we'll be home, we'll be free. 

36:31.823 --> 36:34.090
        - We'll be rich.        
    - Yeah, you know what? Yeah.

36:34.092 --> 36:37.460
Let's just go pop-pop everybody,
gangster boy, fucking pop them. 

36:37.462 --> 36:41.164
  Look, mate, I was only having 
      a fucking joke, alright?  

36:41.166 --> 36:44.868
  I was only laughing with you. 
  I was only laughing with you. 

36:44.870 --> 36:47.938
  But, look, seriously, though, 
will you come upstairs with me? 

36:47.940 --> 36:50.807
          Because that room     
      scares the shit out of me.

36:50.809 --> 36:53.510
    You want it, you go get it. 

37:39.258 --> 37:41.458
              [banging]         

37:41.460 --> 37:43.727
              [creaking]        

37:51.003 --> 37:52.602
            Captain?            

37:54.373 --> 37:55.972
              Sergeant?         

38:01.380 --> 38:02.979
            Captain?            

38:05.584 --> 38:07.851
        [distant voices]        

38:08.320 --> 38:09.919
            Captain?            

38:15.027 --> 38:17.193
          - [screeches]         
    - What the fuck is that?    

38:17.195 --> 38:19.629
              [screams]         

38:19.631 --> 38:21.731
            [screeches]         

38:21.733 --> 38:24.000
              [Mo] Fuck.        

38:35.414 --> 38:37.714
          Swift? Swift?         

38:40.452 --> 38:42.018
        - [radio static]        
            - Sarge?            

38:42.020 --> 38:43.820
        - [radio static]        
              - Captain?        

38:43.822 --> 38:46.089
        - [radio static]        
              - Anybody?        

38:50.195 --> 38:51.561
            [sighs]             

39:29.868 --> 39:32.602
            - What?             
    - [Ollie] Yeah, it's me.    

39:33.972 --> 39:37.307
          - Any sign of her?    
              - No, sir.        

39:37.309 --> 39:39.042
        [Paolo] Alright.        

39:41.713 --> 39:43.713
      You need to take this.    

39:45.283 --> 39:49.185
      We've gotta sweep through 
      the rest of these rooms.  

39:49.187 --> 39:51.855
          She's gotta be        
      around here somewhere.    

39:54.426 --> 39:57.127
          OK. You good?         

39:57.129 --> 39:58.895
            - I'm good.         
            - Let's go.         

39:58.897 --> 40:02.365
        - [radio static]        
          - Mo, Swiftee.        

40:02.367 --> 40:03.900
      Meet us in the main room. 

40:08.707 --> 40:11.775
        [Mo] Sarge? Captain?    

40:11.777 --> 40:13.743
            Is that you?        

40:16.114 --> 40:19.215
      - Fucking hell, Ollie.    
              - [laughs]        

40:20.619 --> 40:22.986
        Where's Swiftee?        

40:22.988 --> 40:26.523
      He went to the ammo room. 
That was the last I saw of him. 

40:27.392 --> 40:29.993
      Did he take any money?    

40:29.995 --> 40:32.529
  I don't know. What money, sir?

40:32.531 --> 40:34.531
Fucking take the piss out of me.

40:34.533 --> 40:38.735
    Did he take any of the money
      and fuck off out of here? 

40:38.737 --> 40:41.004
          I don't know.         

40:46.678 --> 40:48.878
      We're getting the fuck    
            out of here.        

40:51.817 --> 40:54.150
      [Ollie] What about Swiftee
            and Conway?         

40:55.587 --> 40:59.556
      Fuck Swiftee. Alright,    
    Conway must have been taken.

40:59.558 --> 41:01.157
    If we can't find our way    
        to her directly,        

41:01.159 --> 41:03.660
then we'll try and buy her back 
        with some of this.      

41:03.662 --> 41:05.695
    We head north by northeast. 

41:05.697 --> 41:07.530
Keep your eyes peeled for IEDs. 

41:07.532 --> 41:10.333
    For fuck's sake, Ollie,     
    take off that fucking mask. 

41:10.335 --> 41:13.870
      Every time I see his face,
    it makes me wanna puke.     

41:37.229 --> 41:38.828
    [Paolo whispers] Ready?     

41:39.698 --> 41:41.297
                Go.             

41:47.439 --> 41:49.472
[Ollie] So what are we gonna do,
            then, boss?         

41:49.474 --> 41:51.541
  We just gonna walk up to Terry
          and be, like,         

41:51.543 --> 41:53.710
        "Uh, can we get         
    our bird back, please?"     

41:53.712 --> 41:55.979
      [Paolo] Yep, pretty much. 

41:57.482 --> 42:00.850
      [Ollie] Great plan, boss, 
            great plan.         

42:00.852 --> 42:03.286
      That's why I get paid     
      the big bucks, innit?     

42:10.128 --> 42:11.861
            [click]             

42:14.666 --> 42:18.268
    - My foot is on an IED.     
    - Ah, shit. Hold up, Ollie. 

42:18.270 --> 42:19.335
          [Ollie] What?         

42:21.339 --> 42:25.308
    OK, give me some light.     
            Stay there.         

42:35.320 --> 42:37.153
              [Mo] Boss,        
      I don't wanna be rude,    

42:37.155 --> 42:38.855
        but do you know         
    what the fuck you're doing? 

42:38.857 --> 42:40.657
        [Paolo] Careful.        

42:42.761 --> 42:45.028
You got any better suggestions? 

42:46.298 --> 42:48.765
      [Mo] Rent the <i> Hurt Locker.</i>

42:57.442 --> 42:59.709
        [Paolo] Stay there.     

43:02.247 --> 43:03.446
                OK.             

43:04.516 --> 43:06.783
    [Mo] What are you gonna do? 

43:08.486 --> 43:10.119
  [Paolo] I don't fucking know. 

43:10.121 --> 43:15.024
Right, slowly... lift your foot.

43:22.267 --> 43:24.801
            - [gunfire]         
        - Shit. Take cover!     

43:29.507 --> 43:33.843
- [Ollie] Right, what now, boss?
  - Try not to get fucking shot!

43:35.113 --> 43:36.713
                Mo!             

43:36.715 --> 43:39.048
          Mo, hit the deck!     

43:40.452 --> 43:42.185
        Mo... What the fuck?    

43:50.629 --> 43:52.895
        Ollie, grenade!         

43:56.468 --> 43:58.635
      Right, head for the trees!
            Go, go, go!         

43:58.637 --> 44:01.838
      Go, go! Get to the trees, 
          get to the trees!     

44:03.208 --> 44:05.675
          - [Ollie] Go, Mo.     
      - [Paolo] Take cover!     

44:05.677 --> 44:07.143
                OK.             

44:07.145 --> 44:08.478
            - Shit.             
      - Long grass is good.     

44:08.480 --> 44:11.114
              Fuck!             

44:11.116 --> 44:13.349
  [Ollie] I can't see anything, 
          Captain, can you?     

44:13.351 --> 44:15.318
            - Fuck all.         
    - Can you see anything?     

44:15.320 --> 44:16.886
          [Paolo] Uh-uh.        

44:19.357 --> 44:21.157
      Yeah, straight ahead,     
    to the tree on the left.    

44:21.159 --> 44:23.459
          I can see it.         
    I can see the muzzle flash. 

44:25.497 --> 44:28.064
      Captain, if we stay here, 
        we are goners.          

44:28.066 --> 44:29.966
        Alright, we'll make     
          a run for it.         

44:29.968 --> 44:31.768
          - OK, head north.     
              - OK.             

44:31.770 --> 44:33.903
      We try and stay together, 
    but it's more important     

44:33.905 --> 44:35.104
    that at least one of us     
            gets back.          

44:35.106 --> 44:36.773
If anyone goes down, I'm sorry, 

44:36.775 --> 44:38.408
        you're on your own,     
        you understand?         

44:38.410 --> 44:40.710
- That's mission fucking orders.
          - OK, on you, Mo.     

44:40.712 --> 44:42.078
  [Paolo] All right. You ready? 

44:42.080 --> 44:43.546
            - Yes, sir.         
            - OK, move!         

44:43.548 --> 44:44.847
            Cover fire!         

44:45.884 --> 44:48.051
            - Ollie, go!        
            - Let's go.         

44:48.053 --> 44:50.286
      Take left, Mo, take left. 

44:50.288 --> 44:51.521
              - OK.             
          - Keep it moving.     

44:51.523 --> 44:52.689
        Under the trees.        

44:52.691 --> 44:53.723
          Come on, let's go.    

44:53.725 --> 44:55.258
          Move it! Move it!     

44:55.827 --> 44:57.427
        [Conway] Hello?         

44:59.097 --> 45:01.097
            Mo? Swiftee?        

45:02.467 --> 45:03.933
            Anybody?            

45:06.204 --> 45:07.503
            Oh, God.            

45:16.648 --> 45:18.514
            No, no.             

45:22.654 --> 45:24.120
              [sobs]            

45:30.061 --> 45:31.561
          [Swiftee] Conway,     
      is that you, darling?     

45:31.563 --> 45:33.196
        - Oh, my God, yeah.     
        - Can you hear me?      

45:33.198 --> 45:34.831
              - Yes.            
              - OK.             

45:34.833 --> 45:37.066
[Swiftee] Where the fuck are we?

45:37.068 --> 45:40.303
      [Conway] I don't know.    
          I'm so scared.        

45:40.305 --> 45:43.072
          There's something     
          in here with me.      

45:43.074 --> 45:45.441
            - What?             
    - There's something in here.

45:45.443 --> 45:49.112
  [Swiftee] Shh. Listen to me.  
  Have you got a pistol loaded? 

45:49.114 --> 45:51.047
              - No.             
    - Have you got a light?     

45:51.049 --> 45:52.515
              - No.             
  - Listen to me very carefully.

45:52.517 --> 45:54.884
      What I want you to do     
      is turn your head cam     

45:54.886 --> 45:56.219
      onto night vision, OK?    

45:56.221 --> 45:58.287
  - You remember how to do that?
            - Yeah.             

45:58.289 --> 46:01.124
    [Swiftee] I want you to use 
the LED screen as your eyes, OK?

46:01.126 --> 46:03.159
              - OK.             
    - [Swiftee] Have you got it?

46:03.161 --> 46:05.461
- [Conway] I think I've got it. 
              - OK.             

46:07.632 --> 46:09.899
              [sobs]            

46:11.770 --> 46:14.837
            Oh, my God!         

46:14.839 --> 46:17.106
              [screams]         

46:21.513 --> 46:23.212
      [Paolo] Keep it going.    
        Don't slow down.        

46:23.214 --> 46:25.281
      - [Ollie] Keep going.     
        - Don't slow down!      

46:26.351 --> 46:28.951
            - In here.          
      - In here. Left here.     

46:32.690 --> 46:34.457
              Fuck.             

46:36.594 --> 46:38.227
        - Fucking hell.         
            - Fuck.             

46:38.229 --> 46:40.463
          - My bottle.          
        - Straight through.     

46:40.465 --> 46:43.166
  Jesus, boss, someone up there 
    must fucking love you.      

46:43.168 --> 46:45.935
      Yeah, I thought I saw you 
      take two or three rounds. 

46:45.937 --> 46:51.073
      I seem to be alright. OK, 
    we're 5K out from the fort. 

46:51.075 --> 46:53.609
      - The cop is 35K that way.
              - OK.             

46:53.611 --> 46:56.279
  Seems as though Terry doesn't 
    seem to want to do a deal.  

46:56.281 --> 46:59.949
Question is, we sit it out here 
        till help comes         

46:59.951 --> 47:01.250
      or head back to the fort? 

47:01.252 --> 47:03.519
      It's up to you, boss.     

47:06.024 --> 47:07.757
      We head back to the fort. 

47:07.759 --> 47:09.892
  Fucking carefully and slowly. 

47:09.894 --> 47:12.228
              - OK.             
            - Let's go.         

47:12.230 --> 47:14.096
              Go on, Mo.        

47:14.098 --> 47:15.998
    Careful of these trees.     

47:17.936 --> 47:20.203
          [Conway sobs]         

47:21.940 --> 47:24.207
            Please.             

47:25.510 --> 47:28.511
    Please, God, let me go home.

47:30.515 --> 47:31.948
              [sobs]            

47:32.684 --> 47:34.951
        [sobbing continues]     

48:02.647 --> 48:04.814
        I need a drink.         

48:04.816 --> 48:06.916
        You know what, boss,    
        I've been thinking.     

48:06.918 --> 48:10.486
        What if this is         
      just about the money, huh?

48:10.488 --> 48:13.122
      Maybe it's just the money 
        they want, not us.      

48:13.124 --> 48:14.757
        Or maybe it was even    
        those five Brits        

48:14.759 --> 48:17.426
      we saw going into the fort
    and not Terry after all.    

48:17.428 --> 48:20.263
    If it's the money they want,
    then why come after us?     

48:20.265 --> 48:23.499
        - [Mo] Cheers.          
  - I don't know. No witnesses? 

48:23.501 --> 48:26.269
The money and ammo was walled in
    until Swiftee found it.     

48:26.271 --> 48:28.337
    Maybe they robbed the money 
            from Mr T.,         

48:28.339 --> 48:30.673
walled it in and then came back 
  to get it when we showed up.  

48:30.675 --> 48:34.543
          With no transport?    
          I'm not buying it.    

48:34.545 --> 48:37.046
  - They were probably jarheads.
          - No, they're not.    

48:37.048 --> 48:39.315
      I told you, they're Brits.

48:40.251 --> 48:42.084
        Boss, they're Brits.    

48:43.421 --> 48:46.756
  - [Paolo] So you keep saying. 
        - Well, I saw 'em.      

49:34.238 --> 49:37.173
        [Mo] Swift? Swiftee?    
            Is that you?        

49:50.355 --> 49:52.788
              Oh, fuck.         

49:52.790 --> 49:54.390
              Fuck.             

50:08.439 --> 50:09.672
              [screams]         

50:09.674 --> 50:11.374
              Oh, fuck.         

50:12.176 --> 50:15.244
That was Mo. Come on, let's go. 

50:15.246 --> 50:18.614
  Sergeant, you heard my orders.
          Get back here.        

50:18.616 --> 50:20.082
        Boss, it was Mo.        

50:20.084 --> 50:21.784
  I don't give a fuck who it is.

50:21.786 --> 50:23.352
        One of us needs         
        to get back to base.    

50:23.354 --> 50:25.454
          What the fuck         
        has gotten into you?    

50:25.456 --> 50:27.056
    What has gotten into you    
          of all people         

50:27.058 --> 50:29.725
        that you're willing     
        to leave a man down?    

50:29.727 --> 50:32.762
              - Orders.         
      - What fucking orders?    

50:32.764 --> 50:35.264
Just orders, Sergeant, alright? 
    Orders above your station.  

50:35.266 --> 50:39.168
      Well, you know what? Fuck 
  your orders and fuck you, sir.

50:41.272 --> 50:43.539
    You take one more step,     
            Sergeant...         

50:46.144 --> 50:48.611
    [Ollie] You're gonna fucking
      shoot me now, are you?    

50:48.613 --> 50:50.246
        [Paolo] If I fucking    
          have to, yeah.        

50:50.248 --> 50:54.383
  Yeah, go on, fucking shoot me.

50:54.385 --> 50:56.752
            Go on. Huh?         

50:56.754 --> 50:58.554
            What orders         
    are so fucking important    

50:58.556 --> 51:02.291
        that you are willing    
      to leave a man behind?    

51:02.293 --> 51:04.960
              - Money.          
    - Money? Fucking money?     

51:04.962 --> 51:08.531
        Yes, fucking money.     
American fucking money, alright?

51:10.635 --> 51:12.601
          The Americans         
    were supposed to use it     

51:12.603 --> 51:15.438
to buy heroine off the farmers, 
      but they fucking lost it. 

51:15.440 --> 51:19.041
      Our mission was to find it
        and get it back.        

51:19.043 --> 51:21.377
You know how many fucking bombs 
      those ragheads could buy  

51:21.379 --> 51:23.646
        with that shit?         

51:25.483 --> 51:27.383
        We haven't found        
    that money yet, have we?    

51:27.385 --> 51:30.219
      Yes, we fucking have.     

51:33.524 --> 51:35.491
              [gunshot]         

51:35.493 --> 51:37.593
          Next one's going      
      in your fucking head.     

51:37.595 --> 51:39.228
      Yeah? Well, fuck you.     

51:39.230 --> 51:41.597
              [gunfire]         

51:45.403 --> 51:47.670
          [Conway sobs]         

52:32.450 --> 52:34.016
            - [screams]         
    - No, no, it's me, darling. 

52:34.018 --> 52:35.818
        - No, get off of me!    
          - It's me. Relax.     

52:35.820 --> 52:37.453
          - It's me. Relax.     
          - Don't touch me!     

52:37.455 --> 52:39.388
Don't touch me! Don't touch me! 

52:39.390 --> 52:42.491
      Shut up! Shut the fuck up!
          Shut the fuck up!     

52:42.493 --> 52:45.294
          It's me, alright?     
      It's me! OK? It's me.     

52:45.296 --> 52:48.230
  Now, shut up, please. It's me.
      I'm here, darling. Relax. 

52:48.232 --> 52:52.701
    I'm here, alright? I'm here.
      It's me, darling. It's me.

52:52.703 --> 52:54.904
          Relax, relax.         
          Give me your head.    

52:54.906 --> 52:56.572
            Good girl.          
        That's a good girl.     

52:56.574 --> 52:58.874
      You alright, darling?     
      Look at me. You're OK.    

52:58.876 --> 53:01.977
    It's me. Look, it's Swift.  
  It's Swift, darling, alright? 

53:01.979 --> 53:04.446
      It's me, alright? OK.     
        See, look. It's me.     

53:04.448 --> 53:06.282
          I saw you hanging.    

53:06.284 --> 53:07.716
What the fuck you talking about?

53:07.718 --> 53:10.085
    I literally went to get     
        some fucking ammo.      

53:10.087 --> 53:12.021
    What are you talking about? 
          Everybody's here.     

53:12.023 --> 53:15.658
          Everybody's here.     
          Come on, get up.      

53:15.660 --> 53:17.927
    - I need you to get up.     
              - No, no.         

53:17.929 --> 53:19.662
              - Get up.         
          - Stop, stop.         

53:19.664 --> 53:21.931
        Can't you feel them?    

53:24.335 --> 53:26.602
      - Can't you feel them?    
            - Feel who?         

53:28.439 --> 53:30.105
            Who's here?         

53:30.107 --> 53:33.943
      - Who's here with you?    
    - They're gonna kill us.    

53:33.945 --> 53:36.011
          Yes, darling.         
  They're gonna fucking kill us.

53:36.013 --> 53:37.746
        They're called          
        the fucking Taliban     

53:37.748 --> 53:39.515
  and they're gonna fucking kill
              all of us.        

53:39.517 --> 53:42.218
      I need you to get up.     
    Get the fuck up! Get up!    

53:42.220 --> 53:45.854
      Get on your fucking feet! 
  Get on your fucking feet now! 

53:45.856 --> 53:48.691
    I need you to come with me. 
  Get on your fucking feet now. 

53:50.361 --> 53:51.927
            Do you think        
    that the fucking Taliban    

53:51.929 --> 53:53.829
            tied me up          
    and left me here like this? 

53:53.831 --> 53:55.831
      Are you fucking braindead?

53:55.833 --> 53:58.234
      I don't know who the fuck 
  tied you up, alright, darling,

53:58.236 --> 54:01.270
        and that scares         
    the fucking life out of me. 

54:01.272 --> 54:04.106
          But I'll tell you     
what I fucking do know, alright?

54:04.108 --> 54:05.874
    This is your first tour.    

54:05.876 --> 54:08.043
        You shouldn't even      
      fucking be here, alright? 

54:08.045 --> 54:09.612
          You shouldn't even    
        fucking be here,        

54:09.614 --> 54:11.113
            but you are         
      fucking here, alright,    

54:11.115 --> 54:14.750
        and you're doing OK,    
      so get a fucking grip!    

54:18.222 --> 54:22.558
        Mo, can you hear me?    
  Mo, is everything OK with you?

54:22.560 --> 54:24.827
        Can you hear me?        

54:25.696 --> 54:26.996
            Fuck it!            

54:26.998 --> 54:29.498
    Who was the last person     
        you seen here?          

54:30.935 --> 54:33.102
          - I saw you...        
            - No, here!         

54:33.104 --> 54:34.203
      In this fucking room!     

54:34.205 --> 54:36.038
  I saw you and then you left me

54:36.040 --> 54:38.040
        and then I was here     
    in the blackness with them! 

54:38.042 --> 54:42.378
      Boss, hello? Anybody?     
        Hello? Anybody?         

54:42.380 --> 54:44.980
Guys, can youse fucking hear me?

54:44.982 --> 54:47.616
Those fucking cunts. What did I 
    fucking tell you all along? 

54:47.618 --> 54:49.018
        They've tied you up     

54:49.020 --> 54:51.954
        and they've done        
a fucking runner with the money.

54:54.258 --> 54:58.093
        Where are you going?    
        Where are you going?    

54:58.095 --> 55:00.095
          I'm going to see      
  if the fucking money's there. 

55:00.097 --> 55:02.698
          Swiftee, Swiftee,     
          Swiftee, Swiftee.     

55:02.700 --> 55:05.768
            - What?             
    - Please don't leave me.    

55:05.770 --> 55:08.971
    Well, grab that fucking gun 
        and come on, then.      

55:08.973 --> 55:11.040
            Eyes up.            

55:19.250 --> 55:21.517
          Swiftee, wait.        

55:22.753 --> 55:25.187
      Swiftee, wait for me.     

55:37.234 --> 55:39.368
      [Swiftee] This is it.     

55:39.370 --> 55:41.637
    Who put the fucking lid on? 

55:42.573 --> 55:44.840
        Hold the torch.         

55:49.246 --> 55:51.714
        - Go easy. Go easy.     
              - OK, OK.         

55:56.721 --> 55:58.454

          Fucking hell.         

56:17.274 --> 56:18.874
Keep an eye on the fucking door.

56:18.876 --> 56:21.009
              - OK, OK.         
      - Keep an eye on the door.

56:21.011 --> 56:23.078
            [grunts]            

56:25.549 --> 56:27.583
          What the fuck?        

56:30.020 --> 56:31.620
          What the fuck?        

56:42.333 --> 56:44.366
              - [yells]

56:44.368 --> 56:47.603
          - [fires gun]         
  - What the fuck are you doing?

56:47.605 --> 56:51.039
    What the fuck are you doing?
      Put the fucking gun down. 

56:51.041 --> 56:53.909
- Put the fucking gun down now. 
          - Let me out!         

56:53.911 --> 56:56.278
    Stop, stop, stop, stop.     
            Mo, Mo, Mo.         

56:56.280 --> 56:58.013
      - Get me out of here.     
          - Mo, it's Swift.     

56:58.015 --> 56:59.281
    Come on. Give me your hand. 

56:59.283 --> 57:01.083
          Give me your hand.    

57:01.085 --> 57:03.919
    - Aim the fucking gun...    
    - [Conway] You have it.     

57:05.523 --> 57:07.823
      - Mate, get the fuck out. 
      - What the fuck, man?     

57:07.825 --> 57:10.159
      Keep an eye on that door. 
      Keep an eye on that door. 

57:10.161 --> 57:13.495
Get the fuck out. Get out, mate.
          Get out, mate.        

57:13.497 --> 57:15.297
          Get out. Get out.     

57:15.299 --> 57:17.166
          What the fuck         
      are you doing, Swift?     

57:17.168 --> 57:18.967
              - It's Mo.        
    - Get over again' that wall.

57:18.969 --> 57:20.869
              - It's me.        
      - Get up again' that wall.

57:20.871 --> 57:22.738
I'll blow your fucking head off.

57:22.740 --> 57:24.239
          Swiftee, it's Mo.     

57:24.241 --> 57:26.875
          Get up again'         
    that fucking wall now, mate.

57:28.746 --> 57:30.145
        Conway, are you         
        listening to me?        

57:30.147 --> 57:32.147
      Mate, put the fucking     
          pistol down.          

57:32.149 --> 57:34.583
    - Put the pistol down, mate.
        - Swiftee. Swiftee.     

57:34.585 --> 57:36.852
I'll blow your fucking head off.

57:40.458 --> 57:42.724
  What the fuck's going on, man?

57:44.061 --> 57:47.896
    I don't know, OK? It's down.

57:47.898 --> 57:51.066
    One minute I was with Ollie 
          and the cap,          

57:51.068 --> 57:52.734
            and the next        
      I was in this fucking bag,

57:52.736 --> 57:55.003
      and that's all I remember.

57:56.674 --> 57:58.941
    [Swiftee] Don't you get it? 

58:00.911 --> 58:03.745
          - [Conway] What?      
  - Somebody's fucking with us. 

58:05.816 --> 58:08.517
            It's as if          
    we've been fucking drugged. 

58:08.519 --> 58:11.753
    Feels like a bad trip, guys.

58:11.755 --> 58:13.922
          [Mo] What the fuck    
    do you know about drugs?    

58:13.924 --> 58:18.427
  [Conway] Look, it's fucked up,
        but it is real.         

58:18.429 --> 58:20.629
    How the fuck is it real?    
  Hold on a second a wee second.

58:20.631 --> 58:22.698
  How the fuck is it real, huh? 

58:22.700 --> 58:24.132
How the fuck is it real, Conway,

58:24.134 --> 58:26.034
    when you've seen me dead    
      lying in front of you?    

58:26.036 --> 58:27.903
    [Conway] I fucking explained
          to you. Please...     

58:27.905 --> 58:29.671
      - How did you see me dead?
        - I don't know!         

58:29.673 --> 58:32.774
    How did you fucking see me  
    lying dead in front of you? 

58:32.776 --> 58:34.309
        How the fuck did he     
      get in that bag, huh?     

58:34.311 --> 58:36.245
    - [Conway] I don't know.    
        - Where's Ollie?        

58:36.247 --> 58:39.314
- Where's Ollie and the captain.
    - [Mo] I don't fucking know.

58:39.316 --> 58:43.218
I think, see, you, fucking dick,
    I think you're in on it.    

58:43.220 --> 58:44.686
              What?             

58:45.689 --> 58:47.122
    You're fucking in on it.    

58:47.124 --> 58:50.158
      - Fucking in on what?     
    - Don't play dumb, man.     

58:52.897 --> 58:54.963
        You're trying...        
    You're trying to cut me out.

58:54.965 --> 58:56.532
            I know what         
    you're fucking at, mate.    

58:56.534 --> 58:58.367
            I know what         
      you're fucking doing, man.

58:58.369 --> 59:00.269
    You're trying to cut me     
      out of the fucking money. 

59:00.271 --> 59:02.804
  [Conway] Will you just shut up
    about the fucking money?    

59:02.806 --> 59:05.140
      Swiftee, Swiftee, listen. 

59:05.142 --> 59:08.443
    Something happened to me    
              and to Mo,        

59:08.445 --> 59:13.348
          so it's gonna be      
          on the head cams.     

59:13.350 --> 59:15.150
        [Mo] Conway's right.    

59:15.152 --> 59:17.953
    If we play back those cams, 
we should see whatever happened.

59:17.955 --> 59:21.089
    But not here. We don't know 
    what's in here with us.     

59:21.091 --> 59:22.791
      We need to keep an eye out
              for Terry         

59:22.793 --> 59:24.159
        or whoever the fuck     
          is out there.         

59:24.161 --> 59:25.727
          So let's just head    
        up onto the roof        

59:25.729 --> 59:27.296
        and we can look out     
          for all that.         

59:27.298 --> 59:30.399
        - [Conway] Yeah.        
    - [Swiftee] Shh, shh. Shush.

59:35.539 --> 59:38.740
    Grab that AK. Shh. Be quiet.

59:46.350 --> 59:47.950
            Alright.            

59:57.561 --> 59:59.828
              [clanging]        

01:00:00.698 --> 01:00:02.965
              Shh, shh.         

01:00:56.520 --> 01:01:00.122
        - [distant drilling]    
      - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:01:12.069 --> 01:01:15.037
    Guns up, guys. Guns up.     

01:02:13.464 --> 01:02:15.530
          [Conway gasps]        

01:02:36.754 --> 01:02:39.020
          [Conway gasps]        

01:02:41.024 --> 01:02:43.291
  [Swiftee] On point, on point. 

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:12.387
      [Paolo] What the fuck     
        just happened?          

01:03:13.824 --> 01:03:16.525
          I don't remember.     

01:03:16.527 --> 01:03:19.261
        I just remember         
  we were firing at each other. 

01:03:21.031 --> 01:03:23.231
        Fucking look at us.     
      There's not a mark on us. 

01:03:23.233 --> 01:03:25.467
          We should be dead.    

01:03:29.173 --> 01:03:31.306
        What if we are dead?    

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:33.575
    Don't be so fucking stupid. 

01:03:36.313 --> 01:03:38.013
    Maybe the ammo we found     
          were blanks.          

01:03:38.015 --> 01:03:40.682
        No, that's bollocks.    

01:03:40.684 --> 01:03:43.885
        What if this is         
      what it's like to be dead?

01:03:43.887 --> 01:03:46.488
      But we wouldn't know      
    because we're already dead. 

01:03:47.658 --> 01:03:50.392
    - How do you prove that?    
      - Well, I don't know.     

01:03:50.394 --> 01:03:53.528
I am not the philosopher, am I? 
              You are.          

01:03:53.530 --> 01:03:56.998
          What I do know is     
  we're sitting ducks out here. 

01:03:58.569 --> 01:04:01.303
    Well, it doesn't matter     
        if you're dead.         

01:04:01.305 --> 01:04:04.072
          You're so fucking     
          stupid sometimes.     

01:04:07.911 --> 01:04:10.178
  Let's go find the others, huh?

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:21.256
Come on, old man, on your feet. 

01:04:22.159 --> 01:04:24.059
    I'll give you "old man."    

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:35.103
              Fuck.             

01:04:35.105 --> 01:04:37.472
    [Conway sobs] Oh, shit.     

01:04:38.242 --> 01:04:40.242
          Oh, fucking shit.     

01:04:41.345 --> 01:04:44.246
              [Swiftee]         
    What the fuck was that?     

01:04:44.248 --> 01:04:45.814
      Conway, what the fuck     
      just happened there?      

01:04:45.816 --> 01:04:49.885
          That was you.         
  I told you, I saw you burning.

01:04:49.887 --> 01:04:52.454
          What do you mean,     
    you fucking saw me burning? 

01:04:52.456 --> 01:04:54.723
Do I fucking look burned to you?

01:04:54.725 --> 01:04:59.060
          If it wasn't you,     
      then who the hell was it? 

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:03.031
What about the fucking soldiers 
that we seen down at the moat?  

01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:04.633
                No.             

01:05:12.209 --> 01:05:14.109
        Let me see your cam.    

01:05:15.979 --> 01:05:17.679
              - No.             
              - Yes.            

01:05:17.681 --> 01:05:19.748
        - I know what I saw.    
  - Let me see your fucking cam.

01:05:19.750 --> 01:05:22.250
    I'm not doing it again!     

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:26.354
    [Mo] Look, none of this     
    is helping us, alright?     

01:05:26.356 --> 01:05:28.123
        Whatever is going on    
          is happening.         

01:05:28.125 --> 01:05:30.458
    We don't understand it,     
      but it is happening.      

01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:35.931
      Look, look, all this shit 

01:05:35.933 --> 01:05:41.102
  only started to fucking happen
      when it got dark, OK?     

01:05:41.104 --> 01:05:44.105
      But I think it could be...

01:05:44.107 --> 01:05:48.810
vampires or demons or something.

01:05:48.812 --> 01:05:50.845
    - Fucking kid... Yeah, yeah.
              - [laughs]        

01:05:50.847 --> 01:05:54.015
    There's a full moon tonight.
      There could be werewolves.

01:05:54.017 --> 01:05:55.984
        [Swiftee laughs]        

01:05:55.986 --> 01:06:01.089
      [Conway] Fake, real,      
  horror movies, LSD, whatever. 

01:06:01.091 --> 01:06:03.224
          It's all bullshit.    

01:06:03.226 --> 01:06:04.826
        I know what fucking     
        happened to me          

01:06:04.828 --> 01:06:06.294
            and I know          
      they wanna fucking get me 

01:06:06.296 --> 01:06:09.130
and that's what fucking matters!

01:06:10.033 --> 01:06:12.367
      Whoever or whatever it is,

01:06:12.369 --> 01:06:14.602
    it's already got the cap    
          and the sarge.        

01:06:18.809 --> 01:06:21.276
    Maybe they made it back     
            to the cop.         

01:06:23.914 --> 01:06:26.348
      Maybe help is on its way. 

01:06:31.021 --> 01:06:33.288
      Or maybe they're in on it.

01:06:34.358 --> 01:06:36.224
      Maybe they're in on it    

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:37.892
        and they've got         
      a bag of fucking cash     

01:06:37.894 --> 01:06:39.894
          and they're doing     
      a fucking runner, eh?     

01:06:39.896 --> 01:06:43.465
    - Shut up about the money.  
- Just shut up about the money. 

01:06:47.170 --> 01:06:50.138
      Look, they already had    
        all three of us,        

01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:53.842
      so if they wanted us dead,
          we would be dead.     

01:06:53.844 --> 01:06:57.145
    That's why I said it was    
  some fucking whack drugs test.

01:06:57.147 --> 01:06:58.680
            Alright?            

01:06:59.983 --> 01:07:04.919
And it's only you that's saying 
      that they all got us.     

01:07:04.921 --> 01:07:09.224
          And Mo's cam.         
        And they hooded me.     

01:07:10.494 --> 01:07:13.395
        Look, just because      
      you can't remember it     

01:07:13.397 --> 01:07:15.663
          doesn't mean          
      that they didn't get you. 

01:07:17.300 --> 01:07:19.667
      How the hell did I end up 
in the body bag with the money? 

01:07:19.669 --> 01:07:22.504
    The fucking captain and     
the sergeant, you fucking idiot.

01:07:22.506 --> 01:07:24.639
    [Mo] Not enough brains      
  to blow a fucking candle out. 

01:07:24.641 --> 01:07:26.441
          I'll shoot you        
      in the fucking head, mate.

01:07:26.443 --> 01:07:30.278
    Just shut the fuck up.      
I saw something move out there. 

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:32.714
            - What?             
    - I saw something move.     

01:07:34.951 --> 01:07:40.221
    Alright, gonna try and work 
      our way round. You ready? 

01:07:40.223 --> 01:07:42.857
            - Yep.              
        - OK, let's go.         

01:07:45.562 --> 01:07:47.162
                OK.             

01:07:59.643 --> 01:08:01.376
          Quickly. Quickly.     

01:08:30.273 --> 01:08:32.439
            Come on.            

01:09:06.009 --> 01:09:07.908
              [snarling]        

01:09:09.246 --> 01:09:11.779
      [Paolo] Look at this.     

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:15.049
      - What the fuck was that? 
        - I don't know.         

01:09:15.051 --> 01:09:17.118
          I don't even know     
    if our weapons are any good 

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:18.520
    against whatever it is.     

01:09:18.522 --> 01:09:20.522
          What I do know is     

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:22.957
    we can't just roll over     
          and die, can we?      

01:09:25.428 --> 01:09:26.694
        What about fire?        

01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:29.898
          What about it?        

01:09:31.268 --> 01:09:33.801
      I saw some jerry cans     
    over in the other buildings.

01:09:33.803 --> 01:09:36.638
If there's any petrol, we could 
      burn those motherfuckers. 

01:09:39.276 --> 01:09:41.341
    It's worth a try, innit?    

01:09:43.580 --> 01:09:46.447
You go get 'em. I'll cover you. 

01:09:47.484 --> 01:09:49.817
          Fucking hell. OK.     

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:56.791
          Don't fucking         
        lose this, alright?     

01:09:59.829 --> 01:10:01.896
          Yes, Captain.         

01:10:12.275 --> 01:10:14.042
          Wish me luck.         

01:10:20.183 --> 01:10:22.450
            Oh, God.            

01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:28.656
      Go to war, they said.     
  Have loads of fun, they said. 

01:10:33.797 --> 01:10:37.832
              - [clang]         
    - Ah! Fuck! Fuck you. Fuck. 

01:10:47.043 --> 01:10:49.110
    What the fuck was that?     

01:10:55.619 --> 01:10:57.885
          Jesus Christ.         

01:11:07.864 --> 01:11:11.566
              - [clang]         
    - Shit! Shit! Oh, fuck.     

01:11:12.135 --> 01:11:13.635
          What was that?        

01:11:13.637 --> 01:11:15.970
          [Mo] I don't know,    
    but it's coming our way.    

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:17.672
[Conway] It's Ollie and the cap.
              Let's go.         

01:11:17.674 --> 01:11:19.374
    [Swiftee] You don't know    
          what's down there.    

01:11:19.376 --> 01:11:23.311
  Just leave her. It's up to us 
  to keep ourselves alive now.  

01:11:23.313 --> 01:11:25.713
        You don't know what     
      you're talking about, man.

01:11:26.816 --> 01:11:28.616
          [Swiftee] Conway.     

01:11:45.935 --> 01:11:47.535
            Conway.             

01:11:51.608 --> 01:11:53.641
    [Conway] What the fuck?     

01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:56.878
          [distant yelling]     

01:12:08.058 --> 01:12:12.460
        Fuck. Fuck, Swift.      
      I almost pissed my pants. 

01:12:12.462 --> 01:12:15.463
      - What are you doing here?
        - [distant yelling]     

01:12:18.268 --> 01:12:19.901
    [Swiftee] Conway, come back!

01:12:19.903 --> 01:12:22.070
      - [Conway] Come here.     
    - Where are you? Come here. 

01:12:22.072 --> 01:12:24.806
        - [distant yelling]     
      - [Conway] Oh, my God. Mo.

01:12:24.808 --> 01:12:27.375
      [Swiftee] Go, go, go, go. 

01:12:27.377 --> 01:12:28.776
              Whoa!             

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:37.852
    [Conway] Did you hear that? 

01:12:37.854 --> 01:12:39.153
              [Swiftee]         
    What the fuck was that?     

01:12:39.155 --> 01:12:41.222
      [Conway] Light me up.     
          Light me up.          

01:12:45.261 --> 01:12:46.928
                Mo!             

01:12:46.930 --> 01:12:48.463
                OK.             

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:54.736
          Did you feel that?    

01:12:56.339 --> 01:13:00.174
  [Mo] Can't breathe. Not again.

01:13:00.176 --> 01:13:01.743
            No. No.             

01:13:01.745 --> 01:13:04.011
              [screams]         

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:10.485
          - [Swiftee] Fuck.     
  - [Conway] Did you feel that? 

01:13:10.487 --> 01:13:13.454
  [Swiftee] Guys, what the fuck 
      just happened there?      

01:13:13.456 --> 01:13:16.090
            [footsteps]         

01:13:17.761 --> 01:13:19.660
      [Paolo] Swiftee, it's me. 
          Don't shoot.          

01:13:19.662 --> 01:13:23.331
[Swiftee] Fuck's sake, Captain. 
    I could have blew you away. 

01:13:23.333 --> 01:13:25.600
      [Paolo] Swiftee, it's me. 

01:13:28.638 --> 01:13:30.905
          [Swiftee] Captain?    

01:13:36.279 --> 01:13:38.546
              You there?        

01:13:48.024 --> 01:13:50.758
          - What the fuck?      
  - [Conway] Did you feel that? 

01:13:52.328 --> 01:13:56.631
        [muffled voices]        

01:13:56.633 --> 01:13:57.899
    [Swiftee] Let's go. Come on.

01:13:57.901 --> 01:13:59.600
      [Ollie] Hold it there.    

01:13:59.602 --> 01:14:02.236
        [Paolo] OK, OK.         
        Take over here. Go.     

01:14:02.238 --> 01:14:05.339
      [Swiftee] Come on, guys,  
    with me. Come on, let's go. 

01:14:05.341 --> 01:14:10.244
  - [Ollie] OK? Can you hear me?
      - [Paolo] She can't hear. 

01:14:10.246 --> 01:14:12.146
      OK, come on, come on.     

01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:15.383
          [Conway whispers]     
          Oh, God. Oh, God.     

01:14:15.385 --> 01:14:18.986
Oh, God, please just let me go. 
    Please just let me go.      

01:14:18.988 --> 01:14:22.123
      Please just let me go.    
      Please just let me go.    

01:14:22.125 --> 01:14:25.526
    Please just let me go.      
Please just let me see my baby. 

01:14:25.528 --> 01:14:27.662
Oh, God, please just let me go. 

01:14:28.798 --> 01:14:30.598
[Swiftee] This isn't happening. 

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:34.368
      This isn't happening.     
  This isn't fucking happening. 

01:14:34.370 --> 01:14:36.637
  This isn't fucking happening.

        The Father, the Son     
      and the Holy Ghost. Amen.

  Our Father, who art in heaven,
      hallowed be thy name.     

01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:48.149
          Thy kingdom come,     
          thy will be done      

01:14:48.151 --> 01:14:50.051
    on earth as it is in heaven.

01:14:50.053 --> 01:14:52.520
Give us this day our daily bread
  and forgive us our trespasses,

01:14:52.522 --> 01:14:55.923
          as we forgive them    
    who trespass against us.    

01:14:55.925 --> 01:15:01.162
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil. Amen. 

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:12.106
            Come on.            

01:15:20.116 --> 01:15:22.383
  What the fuck's going on, man?

    Where the fuck are you?     

01:17:03.419 --> 01:17:04.485
                OK.             

01:17:06.522 --> 01:17:07.822
          Where are you?        

01:17:07.824 --> 01:17:10.091
        Yes, this is it.        

01:17:15.765 --> 01:17:18.032
      Let's fucking do this.
