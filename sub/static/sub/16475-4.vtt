00:01.068 --> 00:02.735
        - Hey, everyone.

00:02.737 --> 00:04.136
                 Sorry I'm late.

00:04.138 --> 00:06.105
   So what's this secret meeting
                      all about?

00:06.107 --> 00:07.239
           You guys know I'm not
               medically cleared

00:07.241 --> 00:08.240
               for another week.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.776
- It's not
a secret meeting, Jake.

00:10.778 --> 00:12.111
It's an intervention.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.445
          - The tips have to go.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.447
                         - What?
                            Why?

00:15.449 --> 00:18.017
- Jake, we're worried about you,
and you look very stupid.

00:18.019 --> 00:19.084
                  - C'mon, guys.

00:19.086 --> 00:21.053
                 I think they're
            kind of cool, retro.

00:21.055 --> 00:22.054
- No, they're terrible.

00:22.056 --> 00:23.055
                 - Amy, come on.

00:23.057 --> 00:24.373
                  You're digging
                the tips, right?

00:24.374 --> 00:25.690
               - No, I feel like
        I'm kissing Vanilla Ice.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.526
 - There was a time you would've
          jumped at that chance.

00:27.528 --> 00:28.794
- They have to go.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.763
    - All right, you guys got me.

00:30.765 --> 00:32.363
             I did it as a joke.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.432
         I kept them ironically.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.300
            Pretty funny, right?

00:35.302 --> 00:36.602
        I'm just gonna head out.

00:36.604 --> 00:37.703
           - Get him!
             - No!

00:39.807 --> 00:41.607
- Yes, Terry!

00:43.711 --> 00:45.428
         - Okay, okay.

00:45.429 --> 00:47.146
 Wait, wait, okay, okay, okay.
    Stop, stop, stop, stop.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.098
                  I'll admit it.

00:49.099 --> 00:51.049
        I went too deep
     down there in Florida.

00:51.052 --> 00:54.386
 At one point, I think I forgot
   where the tip of me ended,

00:54.388 --> 00:56.055
and the base of the tips began.

00:56.057 --> 00:57.723
  Before we just chop 'em off,

00:57.725 --> 01:00.492
   would anybody like to say
       some final words?

01:00.494 --> 01:01.593
             - No.
      - That was one word.

01:01.595 --> 01:02.594
          That counts.
        Thank you, Rosa.

01:02.596 --> 01:03.595
        Okay, I'm ready.

01:05.165 --> 01:06.732
      - Sorry I'm late everyone,
    but trust me, it's worth it.

01:06.734 --> 01:09.234
   Me and Jake are tip buds.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.235
                          What?

01:10.237 --> 01:11.670
                            No!

01:11.672 --> 01:15.774
                 No!

01:15.776 --> 01:17.076
 - You know what--I do see it.
           It's bad.

01:17.078 --> 01:18.077
         It looks bad.

01:20.000 --> 01:26.074

01:38.299 --> 01:41.800
       - Brace yourselves
     'cause Jake-y is back.

01:44.438 --> 01:47.539
Don't everybody mob me at once.
We can high-five one at a time.

01:48.576 --> 01:49.575
          Oh, I see...

01:49.577 --> 01:50.843
          no response.

01:50.845 --> 01:52.478
     A little "welcome back
    to the precinct" hazing.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.779
     Who's behind this cute
      little prank? Diaz?

01:53.781 --> 01:54.780
                - Kill yourself.

01:54.782 --> 01:55.781
            - Okay.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.032
         - I told you.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.282
    Night shift has everyone
         a little down.

01:58.285 --> 02:00.152
      - Yeah, just because
     you don't get to sleep

02:00.154 --> 02:02.754
     or see your loved ones
        or feel the sun

02:02.756 --> 02:03.822
         or do anything
      that brings you joy.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.307
          That's all.

02:05.308 --> 02:06.791
             - I personally like
                the night shift.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.160
       You know who else
        is up right now?

02:08.162 --> 02:10.162
          - Murderers?
         Armed robbers?

02:10.163 --> 02:11.497
         - Australians.

02:11.499 --> 02:14.466
 It's an whole new demographic
       for me to conquer.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.802
I already have the third most

02:16.803 --> 02:19.137
  followers behind Iggy Azalea
 and the Perth Zoo Wallaby cam.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.305
   - Wow, that's pretty good.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.874
  - It's not just good, Jake.

02:21.876 --> 02:23.676
         It's bonzer.

02:23.677 --> 02:25.477
        - Night shift is boring.
   Listen to the cases I've had:

02:25.479 --> 02:28.814
 drunk and disorderly, drunk and
       disorderly, cyber crime--

02:28.816 --> 02:29.815
      - Ooh, cyber crime.

02:29.817 --> 02:30.833
          Pretty cool.

02:30.834 --> 02:31.850
            - Caught a drunk guy
               humping a laptop.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.452
 - Well, we've all been there.

02:33.454 --> 02:36.188
     But my point is this:
 I don't care what time it is.

02:36.190 --> 02:37.789
  I'm always happy to be here.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.192
           Nine-Nine!

02:41.762 --> 02:44.229
          Nine-Niiine!

02:45.399 --> 02:46.832
         A-Noine-Noine!

02:46.833 --> 02:48.266
    I'm gonna keep doing it
    until you guys chime in.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.169
         A-Noine-Noine!

02:50.171 --> 02:52.538
  - Sergeant Jeffords, a word.

02:52.540 --> 02:54.406
 - What is wrong with everyone?

02:54.408 --> 02:57.943
 - I'm worried our night shift
morale problem has gotten worse.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.578
              - Yeah, you think?

02:59.580 --> 03:00.712
                      I'm sorry.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.247
                  I'm exhausted.

03:02.249 --> 03:04.683
  My wife says when I get tired,
              I get night sassy.

03:04.685 --> 03:05.684
         - Night sassy?

03:05.686 --> 03:06.785
       - Hearing problems, much?

03:06.787 --> 03:09.088
                          Sorry.

03:09.089 --> 03:11.390
  Should I just go tell everyone
   to buck up and do their jobs?

03:11.392 --> 03:13.759
- No, the squad's only on night
  shift because they came down

03:13.761 --> 03:15.727
to Florida to save Jake and me.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.429
     It's my responsibility
          to fix this,

03:17.431 --> 03:20.766
    so I'm going to brighten
the mood by telling a few jokes.

03:20.768 --> 03:24.536
   Try this one on for size:
    I don't care for cheese.

03:25.439 --> 03:26.772
            I'm a...

03:26.774 --> 03:28.607
         curd-mudgeon.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.977
              Wow.

03:31.979 --> 03:34.546
  You're too tired for humor.

03:34.548 --> 03:35.881
         - If he isn't
      taking his medicine,

03:35.883 --> 03:37.449
           you could
    mix it in with his food.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.985
- Sorry, you can deal with your
     sick dog later, Boyle.

03:39.987 --> 03:41.987
   - Well, actually, that was
     about my son, Nikolaj.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.372
      He's got allergies.

03:43.373 --> 03:44.756
   I think we may have to go
      with a nasal douche.

03:44.758 --> 03:46.108
      - Ah, nasal douche.

03:46.109 --> 03:47.459
    Cool, cool, cool, cool.
          Very gross.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.994
       Anyways, I'm back
        to being a cop.

03:48.996 --> 03:50.696
  It's all I've thought about
    for the last six months.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.314
                      - Hurtful.

03:52.315 --> 03:53.931
  - But I won't be fully back
   until I've solved a case,

03:53.934 --> 03:55.334
      just like old times.

03:55.336 --> 03:56.835
      And I can't do that
      without my partner.

03:56.837 --> 03:59.972
- Pfft, you're not solving
any cases on the night shift.

03:59.974 --> 04:01.240
           - Lohank?

04:01.242 --> 04:02.241
     Oh, my God, you look--

04:02.243 --> 04:03.242
          - Beautiful?

04:03.244 --> 04:04.576
 - I was gonna say "less sad."

04:04.578 --> 04:06.511
- Ever since I moved to
the day shift, I'm happier,

04:06.513 --> 04:08.981
healthier, my stepson gave me
my debit card back.

04:08.983 --> 04:10.015
- Lohank is happy and confident?

04:10.017 --> 04:11.016
               Everything's off.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.351
                        Oh, no.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.352
       We're in the Upside Down.

04:13.354 --> 04:14.653
- That's right.

04:14.654 --> 04:15.953
I'm gonna tell you the same
thing they told me when

04:15.956 --> 04:19.591
they removed my testicle:
welcome to your new life.

04:19.593 --> 04:22.361
     - Nuh-uh, I'm not gonna let
            the night shift win.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.862
    Me and my main man Boyle
   are about to solve a case.

04:23.864 --> 04:24.863
   Isn't that right, Charles?

04:24.865 --> 04:26.531
         - Oh, you know we will.

04:26.533 --> 04:28.900
            We'll call ourselves
                 the Night Boys.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.385
     - Kind of sounds like
     a male escort service.

04:30.386 --> 04:31.869
      - The Midnight Men.
         - Even worse.

04:31.872 --> 04:33.338
           - The Dark Stallions.

04:33.340 --> 04:34.940
    - Looks like we're going
      with the Night Boys.

04:34.942 --> 04:36.341
                         - Whoo!

04:36.343 --> 04:37.576
                - I can't believe

04:37.578 --> 04:38.877
             I'm gonna say this,
          but the night shift is

04:38.879 --> 04:40.545
              taking all the fun
               out of paperwork.

04:40.547 --> 04:41.880
           - Mm-hmm.
  - At least we're getting to

04:41.882 --> 04:43.682
  spend quality time together.
    - Totally--I'll be back

04:43.684 --> 04:44.683
         in 40 minutes.

04:44.685 --> 04:45.984
                         - What?
            Where are you going?

04:45.986 --> 04:46.852
               We have to finish
                this by morning.

04:46.854 --> 04:48.404
- Yeah, I know.

04:48.405 --> 04:49.955
I just have something important
I have to do.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.323
                         - What?

04:51.325 --> 04:53.892
- I have to get...

04:53.894 --> 04:55.377
           Some pens.

04:55.378 --> 04:56.861
      - Then why are you putting
                 your jacket on?

04:56.864 --> 04:59.064
  - Pen store's a block away.
- The nearest pen store is seven

04:59.066 --> 05:02.301
blocks away, and it doesn't open
        until 9:00 a.m.

05:02.303 --> 05:03.902
  I learned that the hard way.

05:03.904 --> 05:05.037
            You really think you
                  can lie to me?

05:05.039 --> 05:06.805
             - No.
            - A-ha!

05:06.807 --> 05:08.740
   You're lying to me right now.
 You do think you can lie to me.

05:08.742 --> 05:10.309
             - Yep.
            - Wait.

05:10.311 --> 05:11.410
                        Hang on.

05:11.412 --> 05:12.944
        Was that a lie?
     - I don't know, maybe.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.080
       All right, see ya.

05:15.082 --> 05:17.316
     - Ah, our first case.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.918
       Tasty little B&E--
 just what the doctor ordered.

05:19.920 --> 05:22.754
 Not actually, she recommended
   another week of bed rest.

05:22.756 --> 05:25.424
I was like, "Whatever, dorkus."

05:25.426 --> 05:28.360
       Ah, check it out:
  ducking under police tape.

05:28.362 --> 05:30.095
         I missed this.

05:30.097 --> 05:31.930
          Charles--

05:31.932 --> 05:33.598
   - Yep, yep, on it, on it,
            Jake-y.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.067
          - I got it.
           - Got it.

05:35.069 --> 05:37.253
       - What do we got?

05:37.254 --> 05:39.438
- Back window's broken,
two sets of sneaker prints,

05:39.440 --> 05:42.841
alarm went off at 11:43,
and security arrived at 11:46.

05:42.843 --> 05:43.975
Perps were already gone.

05:43.977 --> 05:46.845
- Okay, I'm thinking classic us.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.013
         I'm thinking old times.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.832
                 I'm thinking...

05:49.833 --> 05:51.650
  Rigity-rigity-role playas!

05:51.652 --> 05:53.618
- Yes, okay,
I'm Jacques Guillaume,

05:53.620 --> 05:54.853
and you are Henri Renault.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.922
We are cat burglars
on vacation from France.

05:56.924 --> 05:59.825
     - I love it--although Henri
  went to an elite international

05:59.827 --> 06:01.460
          school, so he does not
           speak with an accent.

06:01.462 --> 06:03.428
- Wow, nice, way to
flesh out the characters.

06:03.430 --> 06:05.497
              - Thank you, okay,
     so I break the back window,

06:05.499 --> 06:06.898
                make my way over
            to the jewelry case.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.967
   Meanwhile, you're standing
  lookout by the front door...

06:08.969 --> 06:11.403
          - Oui, oui.

06:11.405 --> 06:12.904
- Smoking a cigarette.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.072
         Check it: ash.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.374
                      - Ooh la la.

06:15.376 --> 06:18.143
          Okay, so I am smoking.

06:18.145 --> 06:19.912
     - What are you doing?

06:19.913 --> 06:21.680
             - Oh, Jacques rolls
             his own cigarettes,

06:21.682 --> 06:23.882
       a habit he picked up from
      a prostitute in Marseille,

06:23.884 --> 06:26.051
             but that is not all
                   he picked up.

06:26.053 --> 06:27.419
       - Why do all your
      characters get STDs?

06:27.421 --> 06:28.820
    - Because they're living life!

06:28.822 --> 06:31.490
      - All right, so I go
   to the first case--smash--

06:31.492 --> 06:33.258
   steal a bunch of watches.

06:33.259 --> 06:35.025
    Move over to the second
    case--smash--bracelets.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.595
       But then, we hear
        a sound, and...

06:36.597 --> 06:38.964
      - I yell,<i> "Les gendarmes!</i>
                 <i> Ils sont ici!"</i>

06:38.966 --> 06:40.432
  - And I know what that means
      because I'm French,

06:40.433 --> 06:41.899
 but I ask you to repeat it in
   English, just to be sure.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.452
              - Police are here.

06:43.453 --> 06:45.003
- Yes, we gotta get outta here,
      so we turn to leave,

06:45.005 --> 06:46.805
   you flick your cigarette.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.074
Using the cane, using
the cane, this is awesome.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.910
Voila! Zee butt.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.445
        - I thought Henri didn't
                 have an accent.

06:53.447 --> 06:54.946
         - It comes out
     when he gets excited.

06:54.948 --> 06:56.448
           Great news, everyone.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.750
      We just got our first lead
               on our first case

06:58.752 --> 07:01.186
         on my first night back,
        proving once and for all

07:01.188 --> 07:03.755
                 that absolutely
            nothing has changed.

07:05.058 --> 07:07.092
- Yeah, this opens in
instead of out now.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.977
They switched it a month ago.

07:08.978 --> 07:10.861
  - Yeah, so the door changed,
      sure, but that's it.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.565
             - Well, we have got
            ourselves a case and

07:13.567 --> 07:15.083
        a key piece of evidence.

07:15.084 --> 07:16.600
           We should be wrapping
       this thing up in no time.

07:16.603 --> 07:18.437
- As long as we do it
before sunup.

07:18.439 --> 07:20.639
As soon as the shift is over,
I kind of have to get home.

07:20.641 --> 07:21.640
    - But we're gonna work until
               it's done, right?

07:21.642 --> 07:23.392
    I mean, that's how we do it.

07:23.393 --> 07:25.143
- Yeah, I just like to be home
as soon as Nikolaj wakes up

07:25.145 --> 07:27.346
so I can make him breakfast.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.548
   - Sure, yeah, not a problem--
         we'll be home by sunup.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.584
      Just like a couple of sexy
            "Twilight" vampires.

07:32.586 --> 07:33.618
         I am Robert Pattinson.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.220
      I vant to turn into a bat.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.622
    I've never seen the movies.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.023
- No, me neither--they're
an insult to the books.

07:38.025 --> 07:39.024
                         - Okay.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.692
      Crank up the tunes, Boyle.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.461
                  The Night Boys
                 need an anthem.

07:42.463 --> 07:44.463
                 Something dark,
    something tough, something--

07:44.465 --> 07:46.565
- I already got it.

07:48.669 --> 07:49.634
                - You know what?

07:49.636 --> 07:50.869
                    I'm into it.

07:50.871 --> 07:53.472
                 The night shift
             won't slow us down.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.207
- Why is this going so slow?
Where is everyone?

07:55.209 --> 07:56.608
         - Well, it is 3:00 a.m.

07:56.610 --> 07:57.943
  It's a pretty bare-bones crew.

07:57.945 --> 07:59.010
- Hi, can I help you?

07:59.012 --> 08:00.445
Are you lost?

08:00.446 --> 08:01.879
Can I get you
something--coffee, tea?

08:01.882 --> 08:02.881
       - You know what--
   we're in a bit of a hurry.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.015
  Can you run this DNA for us?

08:04.017 --> 08:05.817
- Well, of course.

08:05.818 --> 08:07.618
Sorry, not many people
stopping by at night.

08:07.621 --> 08:10.055
Sometimes it makes you like--

08:10.057 --> 08:11.556
Right?

08:11.558 --> 08:12.557
               Uh-huh.

08:12.559 --> 08:13.558
- I'll be back in a sec.

08:13.560 --> 08:15.727
                         - Cool.

08:15.728 --> 08:17.895
Yikes...not exactly
the A-team at this hour.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.598
- "A-Team," are you guys
talking "A-Team"?

08:19.600 --> 08:21.166
       I love that show--
      I could download it.

08:21.168 --> 08:22.167
             We should binge it.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.486
           This is gonna be fun.

08:24.487 --> 08:26.804
- Yep, totally excited to watch
five full seasons of television

08:26.807 --> 08:29.841
with you, but could you actually
run the DNA for us first?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.710
  - It kind of feels like you're
               prioritizing work

08:31.712 --> 08:32.744
            over our friendship.

08:32.746 --> 08:33.912
- Because I barely know you?

08:33.914 --> 08:36.715
       - Fine, message received.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.253
              - Oh, welcome back
                 from your third

08:41.255 --> 08:42.654
     massive break of the night.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.890
           - Thanks.
    - I was being sarcastic.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.725
    Where do you keep going?
         - Not saying.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.038
        - Tell me, Diaz.
            - Nope.

08:48.039 --> 08:49.350
      - Come on, tell me.
    - Not talking about it.

08:49.351 --> 08:50.662
    - Tell me, tell me, tell me,
     tell me, tell me, tell me--

08:50.664 --> 08:52.030
- Fine.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.799
I was in the bathroom.
I'm having stomach problems.

08:54.801 --> 08:55.800
          - Oh, okay.
            - Yeah.

08:55.802 --> 08:57.202
            - Sorry.
       - It's real bad--

08:57.204 --> 08:58.579
    - No, that's all right.
  - You should've been there.

08:58.580 --> 08:59.955
   - I don't have to hear it.
   - It was like a massacre.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.331
  - No, you can--please stop.
       - Multiple flush.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.707
         - Please stop.
      - Attention, squad.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.142
    Everyone, gather 'round.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.745
   I've been researching ways
  to raise morale, and I found

09:06.747 --> 09:08.780
     an interesting article
    in a scientific journal.

09:08.782 --> 09:12.784
- Oh, was it from "The American
   Journal of No One Cares"?

09:12.786 --> 09:16.588
 - According to a recent study,
  the physical act of smiling

09:16.590 --> 09:17.689
     can improve your mood.

09:17.691 --> 09:18.990
  I suggest we give it a shot.

09:20.861 --> 09:21.927
              Eh?

09:21.929 --> 09:23.161
        Now you all try.

09:25.732 --> 09:28.934
  Big smiles, bigger, bigger!

09:28.936 --> 09:30.702
       Great, now we just
     have to stay like this

09:30.704 --> 09:31.770
    for the next two hours.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.071
    Can you feel it working?

09:33.073 --> 09:34.606
   - I don't have any enamel
          on my teeth,

09:34.608 --> 09:36.041
so the cold air is excruciating.

09:36.043 --> 09:38.209
  - Maybe if you brushed your
     teeth once in a while,

09:38.211 --> 09:39.611
  this wouldn't be a problem.

09:39.613 --> 09:41.012
     - I do brush my teeth.

09:41.014 --> 09:43.181
        They're decaying
       from acid reflux.

09:43.183 --> 09:44.616
 You're embarrassing yourself.

09:44.618 --> 09:45.617
           - Crikey.

09:45.619 --> 09:46.751
 - You're not Australian, Gina.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.687
   - Get stuffed, ya drongo.

09:48.689 --> 09:50.922
       - Guys, seriously,
   too much exposure to air,

09:50.924 --> 09:52.357
  and they will turn to dust.

09:52.359 --> 09:55.093
- This isn't working out as well
         as I'd hoped.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.795
        Time for the next level:

09:56.797 --> 09:59.731
        forced laughing.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.705
- Well, that lab tech
took a long time.

10:06.707 --> 10:07.973
       - Once we agreed to go to
             his birthday party,

10:07.975 --> 10:09.825
    he was actually pretty fast.

10:09.826 --> 10:11.676
          But, most importantly,
             we got a DNA match.

10:11.678 --> 10:15.747
            We're looking for...
                     Dave Smith.

10:15.749 --> 10:16.982
              Sounds like a real
                  piece of crap.

10:16.984 --> 10:18.433
- You said it.

10:18.434 --> 10:19.883
Now we just gotta
pull his files from records.

10:19.886 --> 10:22.153
        - Yep, then we bust him,
   and we'll be done with plenty

10:22.155 --> 10:23.688
of time before Nikolaj wakes up.

10:23.690 --> 10:24.990
- Nikolaj.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.725
                           - Hm?
       Nikolaj, yeah, I said it.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.093
           - Nikolaj.
           - Nikolaj.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.661
- Not even close.
Nikolaj.

10:29.663 --> 10:31.196
           - Nikolaj.
       - Almost--Nikolaj.

10:31.198 --> 10:32.397
               - Nikolaj--I feel
             like I'm saying it.

10:32.399 --> 10:33.765
                 You know what--
              it doesn't matter.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.200
          Hit me with the music!

10:39.239 --> 10:41.139
        - Hi there, we just need
                to pull a file--

10:41.141 --> 10:42.407
- Can't--system's down.

10:42.409 --> 10:44.142
They do maintenance at night.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.876
- That's okay, we'll just go to
       another precinct.

10:45.879 --> 10:46.911
         - That's all.
             - Yep.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.283
- Hi, can we get
this file, please?

10:52.285 --> 10:53.318
We're in a bit of a hurry.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.854
        - Oh, absolutely, honey.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.330
 - She's going extremely slow.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.065
- She's going so slow.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.367
         - There we go.

11:09.369 --> 11:11.803
       - Oh, my glasses.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.405
   - All right, we'll just go
         to Five-Four.

11:13.407 --> 11:15.874
            - No.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.676
              Hello, hi, please,
                file now, hurry.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.344
         - Sorry, dude.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.011
    I don't know how to get
 onto this system--I'm a temp.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.698
                        - May I?

11:23.699 --> 11:26.383
 Great, let me just get over--
  oh, good lord, that is porn.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.420
   - Oh, is that not allowed?
          - It is not.

11:28.422 --> 11:30.955
          No problem,
  we just close these tabs...

11:36.029 --> 11:37.829
   You've got a lot of them.
             - Mm.

11:37.831 --> 11:41.866
      - Type 3 and type 9
        and 12 and 13--

11:41.868 --> 11:44.436
         those are all
     the diabeteses I have.

11:44.438 --> 11:46.471
- It's true what they say:
night shift makes

11:46.473 --> 11:47.906
for strange bedfellows.

11:47.908 --> 11:49.708
         - In your dreams, perv.

11:49.710 --> 11:51.976
- Ugh.
Rosa?

11:51.978 --> 11:54.279
What the hell? She said
she was in the bathroom again.

11:54.281 --> 11:56.281
          - Nah, she hasn't been
     to the bathroom since 8:27.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.282
- What?

11:57.284 --> 11:58.883
Also...ew.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.251
C'mon, Hitchcock.

12:03.724 --> 12:06.758
            Busted.

12:06.760 --> 12:09.260
- Man, this Dave Smith's
bad news: armed robbery,

12:09.262 --> 12:11.062
aggravated assault,
attempted murder...

12:11.064 --> 12:13.498
       - Well, he's about to get
    a visit from the Night Boys.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.734
           Gah, this stupid limp
             is slowing me down.

12:15.736 --> 12:16.735
              Charles, can you--

12:16.737 --> 12:18.436
- Oh, give you a piggy?

12:18.438 --> 12:19.437
            - What?
      - Yeah, jump on it--

12:19.439 --> 12:20.805
I'll give you a piggy.

12:20.807 --> 12:22.140
           - Actually, I'm good.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.875
            I was just gonna ask
           if you'd hold my bag.

12:23.877 --> 12:24.976
- Oh, yeah, sure,
makes more sense.

12:24.978 --> 12:25.977
            - Yeah.
         - Embarrassed.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.378
       - Anyways, this is great.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.114
  We're definitely gonna catch
     this guy before sunup,

12:29.116 --> 12:31.850
      and you will be home
        to see your kid.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.086
                         Oh, no!

12:35.088 --> 12:36.888
                 Son of a bitch.

12:39.960 --> 12:41.526
- Jake, come on in.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.027
    Nikolaj, look who it is.

12:43.029 --> 12:44.829
   You remember Jake Peralta.

12:44.831 --> 12:45.897
      - From the stories.

12:45.898 --> 12:46.964
   - Yeah, we talk about you
          at bedtime.

12:46.967 --> 12:47.966
                           - Ah.

12:47.968 --> 12:49.234
   - Look at my cement truck.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.035
       - He loves trucks.
   - Cool, it's cool, buddy.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.871
      Hey, listen, I know you're
    with your kid, but I checked

12:52.873 --> 12:54.773
        the file, and our perp's
              last known address

12:54.775 --> 12:55.807
                         is like
           two blocks from here.

12:55.809 --> 12:57.242
- Really?
We gotta go take him down.

12:57.244 --> 12:58.777
                  - Yes, there's
             the Charles I know.

12:58.779 --> 13:01.446
- Tonight, Dave Smith goes down.
           - Tonight?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.181
                    No, Charles,
                we gotta go now.

13:03.182 --> 13:04.915
You saw this guy's rap sheet--he
was arrested for attempted mur--

13:04.918 --> 13:06.785
- Tickling, tickling--
attempted tickling.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.419
              - Right, tickling.

13:08.421 --> 13:11.956
   Look, uh, Charles, this guy's
  a real...doodyhead, all right?

13:11.958 --> 13:13.491
               He tickled once--
            he may tickle again.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.193
            He might be tickling
                    as we speak.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.328
             We could be dealing
          with a serial tickler.

13:17.330 --> 13:18.897
- I really want to go, Jake,

13:18.899 --> 13:20.799
but I'm here alone with Nikolaj.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.033
Genevieve doesn't get back
for three hours.

13:22.035 --> 13:23.468
                 - So let's just
               take him with us.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.970
     Nah, that's crazy--or is it
      just crazy enough to work?

13:25.972 --> 13:27.172
                     Just crazy.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.940
              Ah, man, it stinks
        you've gotta watch him--

13:28.942 --> 13:30.875
             it's really messing
                  everything up.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.527
    I mean, that came out wrong.

13:32.528 --> 13:34.178
    I love that you have a son--
 it's not messing everything up.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.915
     Just messing up our ability
 to solve the case and have fun.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.049
       Ah, you know what I mean.

13:38.051 --> 13:39.450
                I'm a nice guy--
               I'm in the right.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.451
            I'll just go myself.

13:40.453 --> 13:41.519
                   Bye, Nikolaj.

13:41.521 --> 13:42.520
           - Nikolaj.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.355
               - Yeah, whatever.
                         See ya.

13:44.357 --> 13:47.091
- I know your shift is over, and
you've had a challenging night,

13:47.093 --> 13:50.028
     but I think I've found
   a new way to raise morale.

13:50.030 --> 13:52.931
Follow me to the briefing room.

13:57.838 --> 13:58.837
       - What's all this?

13:58.839 --> 14:00.505
   - It's an after-work hang.

14:00.507 --> 14:03.241
    Just trying to turn up,
          as it were.

14:03.243 --> 14:07.312
     We got snacks, games,
     decorations, chairs--

14:07.314 --> 14:08.947
- Yes, chairs.

14:08.949 --> 14:11.516
- Cool, maybe we can mill around
        and small talk about how

14:11.518 --> 14:14.152
  some of us are big lying liars
            who lie all the time

14:14.154 --> 14:16.120
    like a bunch of liars, Rosa.

14:16.122 --> 14:18.890
     - I don't think that's good
                    party convo.

14:18.892 --> 14:23.628
   Uh, maybe we should just name
      our favorite sailing knot.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.864
                     I'll start.

14:25.866 --> 14:26.998
                    The bowline.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.569
           How about some tunes?

14:32.606 --> 14:34.939
 - Cool, merry-go-round music.

14:34.941 --> 14:38.543
    - Yeah, John Phillips Sousa,
        the Skrillex of his day.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.578
                  C'mon, people,
            hit the dance floor.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.347
               Have a good time.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.581
                   Why is no one
             having a good time?

14:43.583 --> 14:45.583
    I specifically requested it.

14:45.585 --> 14:47.018
   Gina, why aren't you dancing?

14:47.020 --> 14:49.254
  - I can't. I'm in the middle
         of a feud with

14:49.256 --> 14:52.624
  the "that's not a knife" guy
    from "Crocodile Dundee."

14:52.626 --> 14:54.092
    He's being a real bitch.

14:54.094 --> 14:56.928
  - Fine, I guess I'll just...
        stop the party.

14:56.930 --> 14:57.629
- I didn't realize
it ever started.

14:57.631 --> 14:59.197
                       - Enough.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.632
       I tried to make this fun.

15:00.634 --> 15:03.334
                  I even learned
              what Skrillex was.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.669
     Sorry you're all miserable,
                 but guess what.

15:04.671 --> 15:06.404
                        So am I.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.573
     I'm exhausted all the time,
         I never see my husband,

15:08.575 --> 15:12.911
the late-night NPR programming--
                   pure garbage.

15:12.913 --> 15:17.181
     I'm done trying. We can all
          be miserable together.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.316
                   Just go home.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.353
- Hey, I saw you earlier.

15:22.355 --> 15:23.922
You weren't in the bathroom.

15:23.924 --> 15:26.557
You were on a park bench
playing on your phone.

15:26.559 --> 15:29.260
Yeah, you left me to do
everything while I thought

15:29.262 --> 15:30.962
you were pooping.

15:30.964 --> 15:34.132
I wish you were pooping.
I wish to God.

15:34.134 --> 15:36.167
                    - I'm sorry.

15:36.169 --> 15:41.606
- Oh, Rosa, crying--
don't know what to do.

15:41.608 --> 15:42.674
Pat, pat.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.208
This feels wrong.

15:44.210 --> 15:46.544
            - We put away Figgis
                three weeks ago.

15:46.546 --> 15:47.979
          Pimento should've been
                    back by now.

15:47.981 --> 15:49.514
         We had plans to meet on
            that park bench once

15:49.516 --> 15:51.983
            the coast was clear,
         but he hasn't shown up.

15:51.985 --> 15:55.019
- Maybe he's deep undercover, or
he doesn't remember who he is,

15:55.021 --> 15:56.020
or maybe he's dead.

15:56.022 --> 15:57.989
                  - Wow, thanks.

15:57.991 --> 15:59.257
                   You're right,
      my fiancÃ©'s a total weirdo

15:59.259 --> 16:00.525
            who's probably dead.

16:00.527 --> 16:03.094
        I'll just give up on him
         and go do my paperwork.

16:03.096 --> 16:06.965
- No, Diaz, wait--maybe he's
just really, really injured.

16:06.967 --> 16:08.333
         Come on, Amy.

16:09.402 --> 16:12.470
          - All right,
   Fiske, Jones, Thompkins...

16:12.472 --> 16:15.707
            Smith.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.141
             Smith.

16:17.143 --> 16:19.577
    Whoa, hey, NYPD, freeze!

16:19.579 --> 16:20.645
           Slow down!
        This isn't fair!

16:20.647 --> 16:22.714
                  I have a cane.

16:24.684 --> 16:26.651
    Stop, stop, stop, stop,
    stop, stop, stop, stop.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.020
             NYPD.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.122
        NYPD--I need to
    commandeer this vehicle.

16:31.124 --> 16:33.157
- It's a crossover.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.259
It's a crossover SUV,
and you can't have it.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.728
     - I'm a cop--can you please
             get out of the car?

16:36.730 --> 16:40.031
- No, this Schmidt's mom's car,
and I'm more scared of her

16:40.033 --> 16:41.632
than I am of some two-bit thug.

16:41.634 --> 16:43.368
   - I'm not a thug--I'm police.

16:43.370 --> 16:44.769
- Okay, then name one law.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.104
            - Don't kill people.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.072
- That's on me--
I set the bar too low.

16:48.074 --> 16:49.307
          - Look, can you please
                   just get out?

16:49.309 --> 16:51.676
- Okay, you can drive,
but I'm not getting out.

16:51.678 --> 16:53.144
            - Right.
 - Also, I have the seat warmer

16:53.145 --> 16:54.611
     on--I don't just have
       a really hot butt.

16:54.614 --> 16:57.181
        - Doesn't matter to me--
         a perp is getting away.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.750
              Oh, it's very hot.

17:00.053 --> 17:02.153
- I can't believe
this is happening.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.621
Thanks a lot, New York.

17:03.623 --> 17:05.656
You know what, if your city's
so great, then how come

17:05.657 --> 17:07.224
it's not the state capital?

17:07.227 --> 17:09.260
         - What--who cares about
            the state's capital?

17:09.262 --> 17:11.496
     This is the concrete jungle
       where dreams are made of.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.064
      That doesn't sound right--
       where dreams are made of?

17:13.066 --> 17:14.464
- I don't know--
you tell me.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.567
      It's your dumb city.
   - It's grammatically odd.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.336
     Whatever, I'm sure wherever
   you're from has strange songs

17:18.338 --> 17:20.338
     written about it, too.
         - Los Angeles?

17:20.339 --> 17:22.173
        - Damn it, all the songs
              there are so good.

17:24.711 --> 17:27.244
- Hey, watch my soup.

17:27.247 --> 17:29.614
       - I'm chasing a criminal.
     Your soup is not important.

17:29.616 --> 17:31.816
- You took an oath
to serve and protect.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.284
That applies to my soup.

17:33.285 --> 17:34.751
           - You know that's not
         what the oath is about.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.320
           You're making a point
      you don't even believe in.

17:36.322 --> 17:38.423
        - Garbage truck!

17:41.761 --> 17:42.760
             - Oh.
           - Damn it!

17:42.762 --> 17:43.761
                    He got away.

17:43.763 --> 17:45.063
- Well, I spilled my soup.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.431
You tell me which is worse.

17:46.433 --> 17:48.833
                     - My thing.
          Very clearly my thing.

17:51.271 --> 17:52.370
        - Captain Holt,
      can we talk to you?

17:52.372 --> 17:53.504
- What is the meaning of this?

17:53.506 --> 17:55.473
Am I the subject of a punking?

17:55.475 --> 17:58.676
   - It's a beginning-of-work
             hang.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.511
- And why are you all
in such good moods?

18:00.513 --> 18:02.647
      - Because you told us that
          you're miserable, too.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.115
                  And that means
      you'll fight to get us off

18:04.117 --> 18:06.150
         the night shift, right?

18:06.152 --> 18:08.553
- Well, here's what I have to
say about that: the night shift

18:08.555 --> 18:11.789
stinks--stinks like a butt.
And I will do everything

18:11.791 --> 18:14.759
in my power to make sure
we get back to the day shift.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.294
What are we standing around for?

18:16.296 --> 18:20.131
Put some Sousa on already.
I want to get wild.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.600
             - Well, well, well,
              if it isn't one of

18:22.602 --> 18:24.719
    the world-famous Night Bros.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.837
  - It's the Night Boys, and--
     why did I correct you?

18:26.840 --> 18:28.306
  I would've preferred "Bros."

18:28.308 --> 18:29.540
                 - Did you solve
                  your case yet?

18:29.542 --> 18:31.342
             - No.
   - Night shift, am I right?

18:31.344 --> 18:32.577
            You remind me of me.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.312
           - It's not
     the night shift, okay?

18:34.314 --> 18:36.781
I found the perp, and I would've
taken him down, but I'm hobbled,

18:36.783 --> 18:38.683
  and I didn't have a partner
    because ever since Boyle

18:38.685 --> 18:40.318
     had a son, that's all
        he can focus on.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.588
   - Whoa, hey, are you angry at
         Boyle for having a kid?

18:43.590 --> 18:46.357
   - No, I'm just mad because
  I'm working the night shift,

18:46.359 --> 18:48.359
   and I have to use a cane,
and, yes, the one thing I could

18:48.361 --> 18:50.161
always count on no matter what--
   Boyle being there for me--

18:50.163 --> 18:51.763
         is also gone.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.364
        - What do you say we let
           day shift Lohank take

18:53.366 --> 18:55.233
        a crack at this?

18:55.235 --> 18:57.702
        - I'm gonna put a little
 something up in the old hopper.

18:57.704 --> 18:58.836
         You tell me if it vibes
                       with you.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.788
- That's so gross.

19:00.789 --> 19:02.739
          - Life moves forwards,
       not backwards, and things

19:02.742 --> 19:04.742
     will never be as they were.

19:04.744 --> 19:08.446
And you can be angry about that,
     or you can embrace the fact

19:08.448 --> 19:10.748
           that your best friend
                  now has a son.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.150
        How cool is that, amigo?

19:12.152 --> 19:14.385
        - Ugh, "amigo."

19:14.387 --> 19:17.788
All right, fine, yes, I'll admit
     it, it is pretty cool.

19:17.790 --> 19:20.158
       Boyle's wanted it
     for a very long time.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.726
I guess I haven't actually spent
that much time with Nikolaj yet.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.211
                     - Nikolaj.

19:23.212 --> 19:24.695
     - Man, am I seriously
 about to take emotional advice

19:24.697 --> 19:25.796
          from Lohank?

19:25.798 --> 19:27.932
         - You know you want to,
                       compadre.

19:30.236 --> 19:32.537
                      Go to him.

19:32.539 --> 19:35.239
        - Hey, I'm really sorry.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.275
      I shouldn't have said that
                  about Pimento.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.743
  I'm sure he's gonna come back.

19:38.745 --> 19:40.545
- I'm not even
thinking about it anymore.

19:40.547 --> 19:42.364
That wasn't even me crying
in the bathroom earlier--

19:42.365 --> 19:44.182
that was someone else with these
same boots, but now she's gone.

19:44.184 --> 19:47.652
- Look, when Jake was in witness
   protection, and I didn't know

19:47.654 --> 19:49.453
   when he was ever coming back,
           you were always there

19:49.455 --> 19:50.855
          when I needed to vent.

19:50.857 --> 19:53.858
      So I'll do your paperwork,
    and if you ever want company

19:53.860 --> 19:55.693
       on that bench, I'm there.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.262
- Thanks...I would advise
against it though--if he does

19:58.264 --> 20:01.365
come back, things are gonna get
real raunchy, real fast, like,

20:01.367 --> 20:03.434
do a lot of licking, that's
probably indecent exposure--

20:03.436 --> 20:05.153
     I don't want to get--
        - Okay, got it.

20:05.154 --> 20:06.871
 You know what--I'll just start
  with this stack right here.

20:06.873 --> 20:08.873
  Thanks, Rosa, okay, good talk.

20:11.477 --> 20:12.910
- Hey, what's up?

20:12.912 --> 20:14.378
I can't work the case
tonight.

20:14.380 --> 20:15.780
Nikolaj's allergies
are acting up,

20:15.782 --> 20:16.948
and now the dog seems to be
allergic to him.

20:16.950 --> 20:18.616
It's this whole thing.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.151
Did you find Smith?

20:20.152 --> 20:21.685
                       - No, uh,
           he actually got away.

20:21.688 --> 20:23.688
         - Sorry, man.
     - Ah, it's all right.

20:23.690 --> 20:25.556
            It's the day shift's
                    problem now.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.425
- Whatever happened to
working until it's done?

20:27.427 --> 20:31.996
     - Honestly...Lohank kind of
      talked some sense into me.

20:31.998 --> 20:35.766
           - Lohank?
    - Yeah, it was so gross,

20:35.768 --> 20:38.536
    but I want to apologize.
          - For what?

20:38.538 --> 20:40.238
    - Well, I kept talking about
         how I wanted everything

20:40.240 --> 20:43.507
           to go back to normal,
  but if that actually happened,

20:43.509 --> 20:44.675
                 this little guy
               wouldn't be here.

20:44.677 --> 20:45.843
                   Or is he big?

20:45.844 --> 20:47.010
          I don't know what size
        kids are supposed to be,

20:47.013 --> 20:48.813
 or anything about kids, really.

20:48.815 --> 20:51.449
    I think maybe that's part of
 the problem--it doesn't matter.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.850
    I got a present for Nikolaj.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.320
- Thanks, Jake.
Come on in, give it to him.

20:56.322 --> 20:57.989
            - Niko.
       - Hey, little man.

20:57.991 --> 20:59.924
                - A garbage truck!

20:59.926 --> 21:01.726
- You wanna know something cool?

21:01.728 --> 21:04.695
     A truck just like this
    almost killed me today.

21:06.248 --> 21:07.798
        - Uh, kissed me,
       almost kissed me.

21:07.800 --> 21:10.368
Anyway, let's get some trash in
    this thing--am I right?

21:10.370 --> 21:11.602
  Vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom!

21:11.604 --> 21:14.538
        - You're silly.
       - Yep, I am silly.

21:14.540 --> 21:16.540
         - Oh, my God,
   this is a dream come true.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.942
     I gotta get my phone--
       I gotta film this.

21:17.944 --> 21:18.943
   Oh, but then I'll miss it.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.344
   Oh, but I want it forever.

21:20.346 --> 21:21.679
       Agh, but I should
      stay in the moment.

21:21.681 --> 21:22.864
   Ah, but then I'll forget.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.048
          Oh, my God,
      this is a nightmare.

21:25.852 --> 21:27.752
