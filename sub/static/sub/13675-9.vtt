into how it came out

we were working on

09:21.311 --> 09:22.972
were some of the same ones
that later came down.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.127
I know. I'm sorry.

14:03.218 --> 14:07.336
I didn't sit you down for an apology.
I'm concerned is all.

14:07.431 --> 14:09.968
I got no big drama to speak of, Mr. Batiste.

14:10.058 --> 14:11.639
You know, just the same old stuff.

14:11.727 --> 14:14.810
Actually, I don't know.
What's going on with you?

14:16.648 --> 14:17.763
Your folks giving you trouble?

14:17.858 --> 14:19.598
If they were around, they might.

14:19.693 --> 14:22.435
-My father been gone.
-And where your mama at?

14:22.529 --> 14:24.736
She got violated on a shoplifting charge.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.859
She's gonna be in lock-up for a little bit.

14:26.950 --> 14:28.815
I've been taking care of my little brother.

14:28.910 --> 14:31.526
-Sounds like a handful.
-He's all boy.

14:31.621 --> 14:35.364
By the time I pack him up, drag him out of
the house, and get him off to school,

14:35.459 --> 14:37.370
I don't feel like doing nothing. I'm tired.

14:37.461 --> 14:40.043
I can see it, but...

14:41.715 --> 14:43.956
I don't want you giving up
on this music thing.

14:44.051 --> 14:45.757
You got potential.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.254
My sisters had potential.

14:47.345 --> 14:50.212
They scored high on their tests,
but they never finished high school.

14:50.307 --> 14:52.673
Coaches told my brother
he had potential, too,

14:52.768 --> 14:55.225
that he could play college ball
if he stuck with it.

14:55.312 --> 14:57.769
Ronald's still working towards his GED.

14:57.856 --> 14:59.972
Everyone I know got potential.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.683
I'm doing what I can now, Mr. Batiste.

(JUKEBOX PLAYING)

15:08.909 --> 15:10.991
Thought I took care of you.

15:11.912 --> 15:15.404
And here you are,
throwing a shadow across my door again.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.239
-More noise complaints.
-What?

15:17.334 --> 15:19.791
Excessive volume of music.

just like you did King Bolden's.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.544
This town is about music.

15:27.636 --> 15:30.924
Your neighbors say the music
is keeping them up all hours.

15:31.014 --> 15:32.879
And I know exactly who they are, too.

15:32.974 --> 15:36.057
I've been giving them $20 a night.
They came back over here asking for 30.

15:36.144 --> 15:39.181
When I didn't give it up, they called you.
Ain't that right?

15:39.272 --> 15:43.390
I am not privy to your arrangements
with your neighbors.

15:43.485 --> 15:46.067
All I know is I got some more complaints,

15:46.154 --> 15:49.271
and I'm here at the bar now.

16:09.803 --> 16:13.136
-Paid in full, motherfucker.
-For now.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.853
You flew in from New York for little ol' me?

17:03.940 --> 17:07.728
Don't flatter yourself.
I've got a couple of prospects l'm chasing.

17:07.819 --> 17:11.403
And that Freddie Hubbard event you're doing,
that could be a target-rich environment.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.866
-Chris, let me get two more Turbodogs.
-You got it.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.656
I wanted to get up with you now.

17:15.744 --> 17:18.486
-Tonight's gonna be crazy.
-You about to fire me or something?

17:18.580 --> 17:19.945

out of your pocket that easy.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.029
(LAUGHS)

17:21.583 --> 17:25.701
The thing is we got a European release
coming up for the CD.

17:25.795 --> 17:27.660
And over there, a jazz recording

17:27.756 --> 17:30.748
can actually sell
a few copies if you support it.

17:30.842 --> 17:32.457
I can't go overseas right now.

-I told you, my father's sick.
-I know it, and l empathize,

17:42.229 --> 17:45.062
but the label needs help in Europe.

17:45.148 --> 17:48.436
-I can't leave right now.
-Can't or won't?

17:49.861 --> 17:52.068
This is a great city for music,

17:52.155 --> 17:54.271
maybe the best in the world.

17:54.658 --> 17:56.865
But it's a small stage with a low ceiling.

17:56.952 --> 17:59.034
You saying I stay here,
my career's off the rails?

17:59.162 --> 18:02.654
I'm saying you stay in New Orleans,
you're making a choice.

18:05.627 --> 18:08.164

18:19.432 --> 18:20.842
when they show up in clumps like that.

18:20.976 --> 18:23.638
Yeah. They'll be here a few hours.

18:24.187 --> 18:26.428

18:36.574 --> 18:38.735

I put out with my father.

24:28.551 --> 24:31.042

they're doing over at Armstrong Park.

-Nothing.

-And she just gave it to you?
-With a smile.

to show me all the fine work

Look, there's nothing wrong with that house
that a carpenter and a little paint can't cure.

If I can contact the owner, he or she can file
an objection to stop the demolition.

27:23.476 --> 27:26.968
But they only got 30 days to do it from the day
they post the legal notice.

(HlSSlNG)

27:49.919 --> 27:51.659
MAN ON P.A.:
These guys have a very particular metabolism

27:51.754 --> 27:54.917
that requires them to warm up,
eat a whole lot,

27:55.007 --> 27:58.124
and then they can chase down things,
but only for a short distance.

27:58.219 --> 27:59.800
They're much more adept at catching things...

27:59.887 --> 28:01.752
Quite a spectacle.

28:01.973 --> 28:06.137
Reminds me of a Louisiana State
highway contract being left for bid.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.718
This is more dignified.

28:08.813 --> 28:10.678
Why'd you pick this spot?

28:10.773 --> 28:13.765
JAMES: lfl brought you into the field office,
I'd have to file a 302.

28:14.527 --> 28:17.769
You know an NOPD
Lieutenant Terrence Colson?

28:17.947 --> 28:20.108
Colson. I know the name.

28:22.243 --> 28:24.029
Whatever it is, you don't seem happy about it.

28:24.120 --> 28:27.283
About a year ago, he comes to my office

28:27.373 --> 28:30.661
asking for two shell casings
I had in my possession.

28:31.669 --> 28:33.705
They were connected
to a murder in the lberville

28:33.796 --> 28:36.378
after the storm, a man named Seals.

28:36.465 --> 28:39.957
How I got the casings
is a long story, but Terry...

28:41.971 --> 28:44.713
Colson finds out l have the casings

28:44.807 --> 28:46.718
and he comes to collect them for evidence.

28:46.809 --> 28:49.095
I don't trust the NOPD with the evidence.

28:49.645 --> 28:52.261
But he signs a receipt for them,
which I still have.

28:52.356 --> 28:56.565
-Go on.
-A few weeks ago, I got a cityjudge

28:56.652 --> 28:59.519
to release the Abreu and Seals files to me.

28:59.614 --> 29:01.650
And in them, that,

29:02.325 --> 29:05.112
which tells me one thing and one thing only...

29:07.163 --> 29:10.371
Colson disappeared evidence
in a pair of murders

29:10.458 --> 29:12.449
that likely involved the NOPD.

29:12.543 --> 29:16.752
-You think so?
-Look, this isn't easy for me.

29:17.506 --> 29:19.087
| used to think a lot of Terry Colson.

29:20.468 --> 29:24.552
But he sent those casings
out to the Jeff Parish Ballistics Lab

29:24.639 --> 29:27.176
knowing they weren't going to come back.

29:28.476 --> 29:30.307
What, you're not going
to investigate this either?

29:30.394 --> 29:32.680
What the fuck good are you people?

29:35.316 --> 29:36.601
Would you read the report?

29:36.692 --> 29:38.683
The report is bullshit.

29:38.945 --> 29:42.153
Colson took one of the casings
you gave him and he lied,

29:42.323 --> 29:46.032
claimed it came from
the Abreu crime scene when it never did.

29:46.160 --> 29:49.323
Then he took the other casing you gave him
and he sent them both to Jeff Parish,

29:49.413 --> 29:51.404
and he let everyone
on his shift know he was doing it.

29:51.499 --> 29:54.957
-Why would he do that?
-It was bait, Toni.

29:55.044 --> 29:58.787
He was baiting the rest of his shift
to see if they were dirty or not.

29:58.881 --> 30:01.623
Terry wasn't up in Homicide a month

30:01.717 --> 30:04.379
before he realizes
he doesn't know who he can trust.

30:04.679 --> 30:07.386
He reads the files. He sees the bullshit.

30:07.473 --> 30:10.556
He sees the reports,
the evidence gone missing.

30:10.643 --> 30:12.179
And so he runs a little test.

30:12.269 --> 30:14.009
And guess what?

30:14.105 --> 30:16.812
One of your shells never got to Jeff Parish.

30:17.817 --> 30:20.604
And so he knows what he's dealing with.

30:20.695 --> 30:24.404
-How do you know all that?
-He told me a year ago.

30:24.573 --> 30:26.609
Terry's been talking with you?

30:26.909 --> 30:30.527
What, do you think you're
the only person in town wearing a white hat?

30:33.207 --> 30:35.493
Thank Christ you came to me with this, Toni.

30:35.584 --> 30:37.836
Anyone else,
and they might be writing Terry up

30:37.920 --> 30:39.626
for a false report even as we speak.

30:42.133 --> 30:47.048
And then I had to tell Al Johnson
and Robert Parker, all of them, that...

30:48.597 --> 30:51.589
Everything I had promised them was bullshit.

31:44.820 --> 31:49.439
Homeland Security,
their public affairs officer, major dickhead.

31:51.285 --> 31:54.402
He gave me the business about Glover being
some kind of hard-ass career criminal,

31:54.497 --> 31:56.988
except I've looked into Henry's background.

31:57.083 --> 32:00.951
He's had a few bumps in his day,
but basically, he's straight.

32:01.712 --> 32:03.452
That's the hand they decided to play?

32:03.547 --> 32:05.003

32:05.424 --> 32:07.961
If it comes to it,
they'll make this guy look like Willie Horton.

32:08.052 --> 32:11.089
Stupid play, though.
Glover's history is easily verified.

32:11.180 --> 32:12.590
They've got that figured out, too.

32:12.681 --> 32:17.471
There is a Henry Glover down here,
a live one with a full rap sheet.

32:17.561 --> 32:20.348
So if and when they get
called on their bullshit,

32:20.439 --> 32:22.976
they'll just back up and say
they got the wrong guy.

we'll discuss the cost of acquiring your work.

Of course there'll be
some kind of compensation.

And when you went into the store,
was there anyone else inside the store?

42:05.982 --> 42:08.268
A young white dude.

42:08.360 --> 42:10.021
He was taking something off a shelf.

42:10.112 --> 42:12.273
We didn't speak or nothing like that.

42:13.115 --> 42:14.525
And what happened next?

42:14.616 --> 42:18.234
I heard gunshots outside the place, shouting.

42:19.413 --> 42:21.699
And then a couple of police come in.

42:21.790 --> 42:23.701
I drop down behind a display rack,

42:23.792 --> 42:27.705
but I could still see them
through spaces in the rack.

42:27.796 --> 42:30.754
Their guns was out and they were agitated.

42:30.841 --> 42:34.754
One of them, the white one,
said that they had been shot at.

42:34.845 --> 42:37.131
One of the police officers
was white and the other was...

42:37.222 --> 42:38.507
Wilson.

42:39.891 --> 42:42.849
-Do you know him?
-Everyone knows him around the way.

Describe him.

42:48.734 --> 42:51.646
Go on. What'd you see?

42:51.778 --> 42:54.770
Wilson saw the white dude and he tweaked.

42:55.907 --> 42:59.070
Started yelling at the dude to get
down on the ground and all that.

42:59.161 --> 43:01.072
And the white dude didn't do it.

43:01.163 --> 43:03.154
Tried to explain himself instead.

43:03.248 --> 43:07.036
He said, "I'm just getting some toothpaste."

43:07.669 --> 43:11.036
And kept repeating it over and over.

43:11.548 --> 43:14.164
And then Wilson holstered his gun

43:15.510 --> 43:17.671
and pulled a different gun he had.

43:19.306 --> 43:22.298
And he put it to the white dude's head.

43:22.517 --> 43:23.552
And?

43:32.194 --> 43:34.355
He shot that man dead.

43:36.698 --> 43:39.280
-What did the white officer do?
-Nothing.

43:40.076 --> 43:42.203
They stood there for a while

43:43.163 --> 43:45.700
and watched the white dude bleed out.

43:46.333 --> 43:50.372
And the white cop,
he kicked something across the floor.

43:51.087 --> 43:52.748
Casing, probably.

43:52.839 --> 43:54.750
Can't say what it was.

43:54.841 --> 43:57.457
He kicked it and they left.

I stayed where l was
in that aisle for a good long time.

44:02.849 --> 44:04.510
Till nearly dark.

44:04.768 --> 44:05.883
And then I left.

44:08.897 --> 44:10.683
I took a last look at it.

44:14.277 --> 44:16.563
Is this the man that was shot?

44:21.409 --> 44:23.070
Could you answer verbally, please?
