09:14.136 --> 09:15.637

LIKE IT HURTS.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.828

OF SOMETHING TO
TELL MA AND PA.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.830
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TELL THEM
WHAT HAPPENED?

10:23.998 --> 10:25.582

TO GIVE THAT
BUBBA WHAT FOR.

10:25.750 --> 10:27.000
I DON'T
WANT HIM TO.

10:27.168 --> 10:29.252
THEN THE KIDS'LL
THINK I'M A
TATTLETALE.

BOUND TO SEE

FUNNY WAY TO GET
A BLACK EYE.

I MANAGED IT.
BUT IT'S A LOT BETTER.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.593

HARDLY AT ALL.

12:41.761 --> 12:44.262
IT'S A GOOD THING
SHE DIDN'T HAVE
HER GLASSES ON.

12:44.430 --> 12:45.722

HAVE BEEN
SERIOUS.

I SURE DID. TAUGHT
ME A LESSON, TOO.

12:55.816 --> 12:57.066
WHAT WAS THAT?

12:57.234 --> 13:00.487
ONLY THING WORSE
THAN ONE BLACK EYE
IS TWO BLACK EYES.

13:00.654 --> 13:01.780
KEEP THAT IN
MIND, MARY.

13:01.947 --> 13:04.824
ALL RIGHT, PA.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.701
DEAR LORD, WE THANK
YOU FOR THE FOOD

13:06.869 --> 13:08.244
YOU PLACE BEFORE US...

13:18.422 --> 13:20.256
HEY, MARY. I JUST
FIGURED OUT A WAY

13:20.424 --> 13:22.383
WE COULD GET BACK
AT THAT OLD BUBBA.

13:22.551 --> 13:24.385
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT
IT, LAURA.

13:24.553 --> 13:26.846
TOMORROW MORNING
WE COULD STOP
BY THE CREEK

13:27.014 --> 13:28.556
ON OUR WAY TO SCHOOL
AND GET A BIG FROG

13:28.724 --> 13:30.308
AND PUT IT IN
HIS LUNCH BUCKET.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.477
HE DOESN'T HAVE
A LUNCH BUCKET.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.939
BESIDES,
IT'S FINISHED.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.565
WE COULD PUT IT
DOWN HIS SHIRT.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.526
MAYBE HE'LL GET
WARTS.

13:39.693 --> 13:41.027
YOU HEARD
WHAT PA SAID.

13:41.195 --> 13:44.447
I DON'T WANT ANY
MORE TROUBLE.

13:44.615 --> 13:46.032
ALL RIGHT.

13:51.997 --> 13:55.291
I STILL THINK
WE OUGHT TO GET
THAT FROG.

13:55.459 --> 13:58.419
[ALL SHOUTING]

14:01.966 --> 14:03.842
YOUR EYE LOOKS
MUCH BETTER, MARY.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.511
THANKS. THAT'S
NOT WHAT EVERYONE
ELSE SAYS.

14:06.679 --> 14:10.515
NO, REALLY,
IT DOES. HONEST.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.308
DOES IT
STILL HURT?

14:12.476 --> 14:15.645
NOT MUCH.

14:15.813 --> 14:18.314
- HEY!
- HEY WHAT?

14:18.482 --> 14:20.525
COME ON, LAURA.
LET'S GO.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.068
LET'S GO.

14:29.743 --> 14:33.204
THAT'S A VERY
GOOD TRICK.

14:33.372 --> 14:35.206
I DON'T THINK
IT'S TOO MUCH.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.833
MAYBE YOU'D LIKE TO TRY IT.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.877
THE SEESAW'S
FOR TWO PEOPLE.

14:39.044 --> 14:40.295
WELL,
I GOT IT NOW.

14:40.462 --> 14:43.089
I'LL GIVE YOU
A SOUR BALL IF YOU
LET ME USE IT.

14:46.343 --> 14:47.427
YOU GOT CANDY?

14:47.595 --> 14:51.764
YEAH, MY PA'S GOT LOTS
OF IT IN THE STORE.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.142
BET YOU COULD GET
ALL YOU WANT, HUH?
EVERY DAY?

14:54.310 --> 14:58.229
I'LL BRING YOU SOME
IF WE'RE FRIENDS.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.939
LET ME SEE THE SOUR BALL.

15:04.862 --> 15:07.906
ALL RIGHT.
YOU CAN USE
THE SEESAW.

15:08.073 --> 15:09.949
I SAID HER.

15:18.876 --> 15:20.710
ISN'T THAT JUST
LIKE THAT NELLIE,

15:20.878 --> 15:23.838
MAKING UP
TO THAT OLD BULLY,
GIVING HIM CANDY?

15:24.006 --> 15:25.715
THERE'S ONE GOOD
THING ABOUT IT.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.217
WELL, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.845
MAYBE THEY'LL
BOTH WIND UP WITH
ROTTEN TEETH.

15:42.024 --> 15:44.776
AH, GOOD MORNING,
MR. HENDERSON.
HOW ARE YOU?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.444
WHY, JUST FINE,
MR. HANSON,
JUST FINE.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.780
GOOD. I WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT
CHARLES SAID

15:48.948 --> 15:52.200
THAT YOUR ORDER
WILL BE CUT AND
DELIVERED BY TUESDAY.

15:52.368 --> 15:54.827
OH, WELL, I WAS
JUST ON MY WAY
DOWN TO THE MILL.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.538
I WANTED TO TELL YOU
THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE
NEEDING THAT LUMBER.

15:57.706 --> 16:01.668
OH. YOU'RE NOT GOING TO
BUILD THE BARN, HUH?

16:01.835 --> 16:03.586
WELL, NO, THAT'S
NOT IT EXACTLY.

16:03.754 --> 16:04.796
I JUST GOT
A BETTER PRICE.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.883
BUT...I GAVE YOU
THE BEST PRICE.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.134
I KNOW, MR. HANSON.

16:10.302 --> 16:12.804
I KNOW YOU DID,
BUT THESE FELLAS
BEAT IT--

16:12.972 --> 16:14.055
BEAT IT BY $3.00.

16:14.223 --> 16:16.099
CAME BY MY PLACE
EARLY THIS MORNING.

16:16.266 --> 16:19.978
THEY HAD--THEY HAD
EXACTLY THE MATERIALS
THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.270
HOPE YOU
UNDERSTAND.

16:21.438 --> 16:24.941
COULDN'T TURN IT DOWN.
NO HARD FEELINGS.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.819
OH, YEAH, YEAH,
I UNDERSTAND.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.989
THANK YOU,
MR. HANSON.
BE SEEING YOU.

16:35.452 --> 16:38.204
MR. HENDERSON?

16:38.372 --> 16:41.708
UH, THE FELLAS
THAT SOLD YOU
THAT LUMBER--

16:41.875 --> 16:42.959
DID YOU GET
THEIR NAMES?

16:43.127 --> 16:45.461
UM...YEAH.

16:45.629 --> 16:48.089
HIS NAME WAS, UH,
GA--GAL--GALENDER.

16:48.257 --> 16:49.465
THAT'S WHAT IT
WAS. GALENDER.

16:49.633 --> 16:52.093
SAID THAT THEY WERE
SETTLING IN HEREABOUTS.

17:21.415 --> 17:23.583
IF THERE IS ONE THING
I CANNOT STAND,

17:23.751 --> 17:25.293
IT IS A LIAR
AND A THIEF.

17:25.461 --> 17:27.003
WELL, I CAN'T DENY
TELLING A STORY
NOW AND AGAIN,

17:27.171 --> 17:28.504
BUT I AIN'T NEVER
TAKING NOTHING.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.673
NO, NO, IT DOESN'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO
DO WITH YOU.

17:30.841 --> 17:31.716
IT IS THE GALENDERS.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.010
THEY ARE BOTH
LIARS AND THIEVES!

17:34.178 --> 17:36.846
I DON'T RIGHTLY
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.182
YOU KNOW THAT
LOAD OF LUMBER THAT
CHARLES DELIVERED?

17:39.349 --> 17:40.933
- UH-HUH.
- YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID?

17:41.101 --> 17:44.353
THEY SOLD IT
TO HENDERSON
$3.00 CHEAPER!

17:44.521 --> 17:47.231
AND I LOSE BOTH
THE LUMBER AND
THE ORDER.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.650
NO MATTER ABOUT THAT,
THEY STILL HAVE GOT
TO PAY YOU FOR IT.

17:49.818 --> 17:51.986
OH, YEAH, SURE,
SURE, THEY PAY.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.738
THEY LIE!
THAT'S WHAT THEY DO.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.948
AND THEY ARE NOT
EVEN ASHAMED!

17:56.116 --> 17:57.575
WELL, SOMEBODY OUGHT TO
HAVE A TALK WITH THEM.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.578
NO, NELS OLESON
ALREADY HAS TRIED.

18:00.746 --> 18:02.246
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DID?

18:02.414 --> 18:05.833
THEY TOOK ALMOST
$20 WORTH OF HIS
MERCHANDISE.

18:06.001 --> 18:08.169
WAIT, YOU DON'T JUST
TAKE SOMETHING AND
NOT PAY FOR IT.

18:08.337 --> 18:09.879
THEY SAY THEY'D PAY.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.714
YOU SEE, THAT WAY
IT IS CREDIT.

18:11.882 --> 18:14.342
YOU CAN'T PUT A MAN
IN JAIL FOR HIS BILLS.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.886
WELL, SOMEBODY OUGHT TO TAKE
A SWITCH TO THEM [INDISTINCT].

18:17.054 --> 18:18.888
BACK IN DUVAL COUNTY,
WE HAD SOME FELLAS

18:19.056 --> 18:21.099
WOULD NOTHING DO BUT TAKE
THEM DOWN TO THE CREEK--

18:21.266 --> 18:22.642
NO! NO.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.393
THAT ONLY
MAKES TROUBLE.

18:24.561 --> 18:26.062
I'VE SEEN THIS
KIND BEFORE.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.314
THEY GROW TIRED AND
THEN THEY MOVE ON.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.441
THAT IS BEST, THEN
NO ONE GETS HURT.

18:30.609 --> 18:34.737
BUT...LEAST YOU COULD
HAVE DONE IS LET ME
FINISH MY STORY.

18:34.905 --> 18:36.614
IT WAS A PIP.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.871
YOU SHOULD HAVE HEARD
MRS. OLESON AT THE
WOMEN'S LEAGUE TODAY.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.540
WHY, I THOUGHT SHE WAS
GOING TO HAVE NELS GO OUT

18:45.707 --> 18:47.959
AND TAKE A SHOTGUN
TO THOSE GALENDERS.

18:48.127 --> 18:51.254
IT'D BE THE FIRST TIME
THAT WOMAN AND I EVER
SAW EYE TO EYE.

18:51.421 --> 18:52.713
SHE WASN'T
THE ONLY ONE.

18:52.881 --> 18:55.341
SEEMS THEY GOT
A SIDE OF BEEF
FROM THE MORTONS

18:55.509 --> 19:00.304
AND HAY AND FEED
FROM THE STEVENS,
ALL ON CREDIT.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.182
SOUNDS LIKE THE
SAME THING THEY
PULLED ON HANSON.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.767
IF YOU ASK ME,
THE SOONER
THE GALENDERS

19:04.935 --> 19:06.102
GET THEIR HEADS
KNOCKED TOGETHER,

19:06.270 --> 19:07.770
THE BETTER OFF
THIS TOWN'S
GOING TO BE.

19:07.938 --> 19:10.189
CHARLES, THAT
SOUNDS AWFULLY HARSH.

19:10.357 --> 19:13.317
DON'T BE SO SURE
THEY'RE GENTLEFOLK.

19:13.485 --> 19:17.572
WELL, WHEN THEY GET TO
KNOW PEOPLE BETTER...

19:17.739 --> 19:21.242
A FELLA COULD GO
BROKE GETTING TO
KNOW THE GALENDERS.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.745
GOOD NIGHT.

19:37.050 --> 19:39.177
BE SEATED, PLEASE.

19:42.639 --> 19:45.141
THIS MORNING'S
SERMON...

19:45.309 --> 19:46.851
DEALS WITH A PROBLEM
THAT I UNDERSTAND

19:47.019 --> 19:49.061
CONCERNS MANY OF YOU
IN THE CONGREGATION.

19:49.229 --> 19:52.481
NOW, I KNOW THAT
SOME OF YOU HAVE...

19:52.649 --> 19:55.610
SUFFERED UNDUE COSTS...

19:55.777 --> 19:57.153
AND SOME ABUSE.

19:57.321 --> 19:58.321
BUT I WOULD REMIND YOU

19:58.488 --> 20:01.824
THAT THE LORD TESTS
US IN MANY WAYS.

20:01.992 --> 20:07.496
SOME OF THE HYMNS
THAT WE SING IN CHURCH...

20:07.664 --> 20:09.624
SPEAK OF COURAGE.

20:09.791 --> 20:12.210
BUT IT'S
CHRISTIAN COURAGE.

20:12.377 --> 20:16.339
AND NOWHERE IN THE
BIBLE DOES THE LORD
REWARD COWARDICE.

20:16.506 --> 20:21.969
BUT THE ABILITY
TO...ENDURE...

20:22.137 --> 20:25.014
TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK...

20:25.182 --> 20:28.100
THAT'S THE GREATEST
COURAGE OF ALL.

20:28.268 --> 20:30.353
NOW, I WOULD ASK YOU
AS THE SCRIPTURES DO,

20:30.520 --> 20:34.482
MEET THIS PROBLEM
WITH REASON,
CHRISTIAN CHARITY.

20:34.650 --> 20:38.319
FOR DO WE NOT PRAY

20:38.487 --> 20:39.779
FORGIVE US OUR
TRESPASSES...

20:39.947 --> 20:44.867
AS WE FORGIVE
THOSE WHO TRESPASS
AGAINST US?

20:47.663 --> 20:52.375
FOR THAT REASON,
LET ME SPEAK TO THESE
MEN IN YOUR BEHALF.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.752
YOU KNOW, YOU WAS WRONG
ABOUT THAT MAN'S POKE.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.047
A DOLLAR, A QUARTER,
A DIME, AND A NICKEL--

20:58.215 --> 20:59.632
WELL, THAT'S NOT
A DOLLAR AND A HALF.

20:59.800 --> 21:00.967
IT'S $1.35.

21:01.134 --> 21:03.261
WELL, I JUST THOUGHT
I'D CHECK YOU OUT.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.347
BY THE TIME YOU GOT
THAT SUM FIGURED OUT,

21:06.515 --> 21:08.015
SOMEBODY'D COME ALONG
AND TAKE THAT POKE.

21:08.183 --> 21:09.267
NOW GET ME SOME COFFEE.

21:09.434 --> 21:10.518
WHY DO I'VE GOT
GET THE COFFEE?

21:10.686 --> 21:12.603
YOU DON'T EVEN
LET ME DRINK COFFEE.

21:12.771 --> 21:16.482
GET ME SOME COFFEE.

21:16.650 --> 21:19.193
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

21:19.361 --> 21:21.529
SEE WHO'S
AT THE DOOR.

21:26.243 --> 21:27.451
IT'S A PREACHER.

21:27.619 --> 21:31.414
WELL, DON'T JUST
STAND THERE, BUBBA.
COME IN.

21:31.581 --> 21:34.667
COME ON IN...
REVEREND...

21:34.835 --> 21:35.793
ALDEN.
ALDEN.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.128
I'M THE PASTOR
OF THE CHURCH HERE.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.254
SAM GALENDER.
STAND UP, GEORGE.

21:38.422 --> 21:39.588
HOW DO YOU DO?

21:39.756 --> 21:42.591
BUBBA, SET ANOTHER
PLATE FOR THE PREACHER,
WOULD YOU?

21:42.759 --> 21:43.968
OH, THAT'S
NOT NECESSARY.

21:44.136 --> 21:45.594
OH, YEAH. OUR
MAMA ALWAYS SAID

21:45.762 --> 21:46.971
YOU'VE GOT TO
FEED THE PREACHER

21:47.139 --> 21:48.848
OR PAY THE DEVIL.
RIGHT, SAM?

21:49.016 --> 21:49.890
YES, SHE DID,
SURE ENOUGH.

21:50.058 --> 21:51.350
HERE, HAVE
A SEAT.

21:51.518 --> 21:57.315
THANK YOU.
YOUR MOTHER SOUNDS
LIKE A GOD-FEARING WOMAN.

21:57.482 --> 22:00.276
I DOUBT THAT
SHE'D APPROVE
OF THE ADVANTAGE

22:00.444 --> 22:03.404
YOU'VE TAKEN OF THE
PEOPLE OF THE TOWN
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HERE.

22:03.572 --> 22:05.990
WHAT'S HE TALKING
ABOUT, SAM?

22:06.158 --> 22:08.117
WELL, I
DON'T KNOW.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.869
IF WE'VE DONE
SOMETHING WRONG,
PREACHER,

22:10.037 --> 22:13.080
I WISH YOU'D
SPELL IT OUT.

22:13.248 --> 22:15.082
WELL, I'M TALKING ABOUT
THE PURCHASES YOU MADE,

22:15.250 --> 22:20.129
THE BILLS YOU RAN UP
WITHOUT ANY OFFER TO PAY...

22:20.297 --> 22:22.298
THE OUTRIGHT INTIMIDATION.

22:22.466 --> 22:23.966
NOW, HOLD ON
A MINUTE, PREACHER.

22:24.134 --> 22:25.509
NOW, JU--JUST
WAIT A MINUTE.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.846
YOU'RE GETTING
THE WRONG IDEA ABOUT
US FROM SOMEBODY.

22:29.014 --> 22:30.139
YEAH. THE LAST THING
WE WANT TO DO

22:30.307 --> 22:31.807
IS CAUSE
ANY HARD FEELINGS.

22:31.975 --> 22:33.100
WE LIKE THIS TOWN.

22:33.268 --> 22:35.311
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE FACT OF THE
MATTER IS,

22:35.479 --> 22:36.479
THERE'S A BANK DRAFT

22:36.646 --> 22:38.814
COMING FROM ST. PAUL
THAT'S OVERDUE,

22:38.982 --> 22:41.984
OR ELSE WE WOULDN'T
OWE ANYBODY ANYTHING
RIGHT NOW.

22:42.152 --> 22:46.197
WELL, THAT DOESN'T
EXPLAIN THE OUTRIGHT
SALE OF THE LUMBER

22:46.365 --> 22:49.492
THAT YOU BOUGHT
FROM MR. HANSON.

22:49.659 --> 22:50.701
OH.

22:50.869 --> 22:54.080
NO, SIR,
IT DOESN'T.

22:54.247 --> 22:56.123
BUBBA, YOU SKIP
ON OUTSIDE FOR A
MINUTE, WOULD YOU?

22:56.291 --> 22:57.416
WHAT FOR?

22:57.584 --> 23:00.002
I WANT TO TALK
TO THE PREACHER.
NOW GIT.

23:00.170 --> 23:02.004
I MAKE YOUR
COFFEE, CHOP
THE WOOD.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.923
WHAT ELSE
YOU WANT ME
TO DO?

23:05.759 --> 23:09.720
NO SENSE A YOUNG'UN
BEARING UP TO SOMETHING
HE CAN'T HANDLE.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.680
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

23:11.848 --> 23:15.101
WELL, IT'S HIS MAMA.

23:15.268 --> 23:16.435
YEAH, OUR MA.

23:16.603 --> 23:20.022
AND WE GOT WORD
THAT SHE TOOK TERRIBLE,

23:20.190 --> 23:21.649
TERRIBLE SICK.

23:21.817 --> 23:25.361
IT WAS RIGHT AFTER
WE BOUGHT THE LUMBER, TOO,
WASN'T IT, GEORGE?

23:31.201 --> 23:33.411
NEAR TO DYING,
THE MAN SAID.

23:33.578 --> 23:36.122
I'M VERY, VERY SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

23:36.289 --> 23:37.373
WELL, THANK YOU,
PREACHER,

23:37.541 --> 23:40.835
AND WHAT WITH
THE BANK DRAFT
BEING OVERDUE

23:41.002 --> 23:42.044
AND US WITHOUT
ANY MONEY,

23:42.212 --> 23:44.797
WHY, THE $15 THAT
WE GOT FOR THE LUMBER

23:44.965 --> 23:48.008
WAS THE ONLY HELP
WE COULD SEND.

23:48.176 --> 23:51.220
YOU SHOULD HAVE
TOLD MR. HANSON.

23:51.388 --> 23:53.180
YEAH, I SUPPOSE
I SHOULD HAVE,

23:53.348 --> 23:56.267
BUT I--I DIDN'T WANT IT
TO GET BACK TO THE BOY,

23:56.435 --> 24:00.062
WHAT WITH HIM SETTLING
INTO SCHOOL AND ALL.

24:00.230 --> 24:03.065
BREAK HIS POOR
LITTLE HEART IF SHE
DOESN'T MAKE IT.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.109
BLESS HER.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.861
SO THAT'S WHY
WE'D APPRECIATE IT

24:07.028 --> 24:09.071
IF YOU WOULDN'T
SAY ANYTHING EITHER,
PREACHER.

24:09.239 --> 24:12.158
NOW, OF COURSE,
WE'RE GOING TO PAY
MR. HANSON BACK

24:12.325 --> 24:14.410
JUST THE SECOND
THAT BANK DRAFT
COMES IN.

24:14.578 --> 24:15.953
WELL, UNDER
THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

24:16.121 --> 24:18.831
I WOULDN'T SAY
ANYTHING TO ANYONE.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.542
I'M GLAD YOU SEE IT
THAT WAY, REVEREND.

24:21.710 --> 24:23.919
[SHOUTS]
BUBBA!

24:26.089 --> 24:27.339
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

24:27.507 --> 24:31.510
WE OWE YOU AN
APOLOGY FOR NOT
COMING TO THE CHURCH.

24:31.678 --> 24:34.930
BUT YOU CAN
COUNT ON US
COME NEXT SUNDAY.

24:35.098 --> 24:36.348
I'LL LOOK
FORWARD TO IT.

24:36.516 --> 24:39.268
VERY GOOD.
NOW HOW ABOUT
HAVING SOMETHING TO EAT?

24:39.436 --> 24:42.104
OH, YES, OR WE'RE
GOING TO PAY THE DEVIL.

24:42.272 --> 24:44.899
WELL, MAYBE
JUST A BIT.

24:45.066 --> 24:47.026
VERY GOOD.
YOU HEARD HIM,
BUBBA.

24:47.194 --> 24:49.820
SET A PLACE
FOR THE PREACHER
HERE.

25:13.845 --> 25:15.471
MARY, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

25:15.639 --> 25:17.598
YES, MA'AM.

25:17.766 --> 25:20.100
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU
TO SIT THROUGH RECESS.

25:20.268 --> 25:21.393
SORRY, MISS BEADLE.

25:21.561 --> 25:23.687
GUESS I JUST DON'T
FEEL LIKE PLAYING.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.249
THAT'S IT FOR
YOU, WILLIE.

25:43.416 --> 25:46.752
I'M GOING TO WIN
THEM ALL NOW.

25:46.920 --> 25:49.296
THAT'S NO FAIR!
YOU'RE HUNCHING.

25:49.464 --> 25:51.215
I AM NOT.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.133
NO HUNCHIES
AND KNUCKLES DOWN.

25:53.301 --> 25:54.385
THAT'S WHAT
WE SAID.

25:54.553 --> 25:58.806
YOU'RE JUST MAD
BECAUSE I'M WINNING.

26:01.476 --> 26:05.771
WELL, LAURA INGALLS
IS TRYING TO CHEAT
MY BROTHER AGAIN.

26:05.939 --> 26:07.648
MAYBE I'D BETTER
GET IN THIS GAME.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.358
YOU CAN'T.
IT'S TOO LATE.

26:09.526 --> 26:10.818
WE'RE ALMOST
FINISHED.

YOU'RE ALL THROUGH.

26:14.739 --> 26:15.948
YOU AIN'T GOT
NO MARBLES LEFT.

26:16.116 --> 26:19.660
GET YOUR FOOT OFF.
THOSE ARE MY MARBLES.

26:19.828 --> 26:22.746
I DON'T SEE NO MARBLES.
DO YOU, NELLIE?

26:22.914 --> 26:23.956
I SHOULD SAY NOT.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.708
PART OF THEM
ARE MINE.

26:25.875 --> 26:27.209
HUSH, WILLIE.

26:27.377 --> 26:28.502
Laura:
GET YOUR FOOT OFF.

26:28.670 --> 26:29.795
Bubba: MAKE ME.

26:29.963 --> 26:31.547
ALL RIGHT.

26:31.715 --> 26:34.049
YOU ASKED FOR IT.

26:34.217 --> 26:36.051
Mary: LAURA!

26:36.219 --> 26:39.138
LAURA,
HE'LL ONLY KNOCK
YOU DOWN AGAIN.

26:39.306 --> 26:42.266
YOUR SISTER KNOWS.
BETTER LISTEN TO HER.

26:49.983 --> 26:50.983
Willie:
MOST OF THOSE
ARE MINE!

26:51.151 --> 26:52.401
HUH?

26:52.569 --> 26:56.405
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I DIDN'T WANT THEM
ANYWAYS.

26:56.573 --> 26:59.950
I WANT TO
SWING NOW, BUBBA.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.744
THAT NELLIE.

27:01.911 --> 27:04.413
JUST WAIT
UNTIL I CATCH
HER ALONE.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.582
THAT WOULD ONLY
CAUSE MORE TROUBLE.

27:06.750 --> 27:11.211
BESIDES,
YOU REMEMBER WHAT
REVEREND ALDEN SAID.

27:11.379 --> 27:13.172
I'M MORE WORRIED
ABOUT WHAT MA'S
GOING TO SAY

27:13.340 --> 27:15.257
WHEN SHE
SEES MY DRESS.

27:15.425 --> 27:17.426
DON'T BE.
WE'LL STOP BY
MRS. WHIPPLE'S.

27:17.594 --> 27:20.429
I'LL FIX IT SO
MA'LL NEVER NOTICE.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.931
SOMEONE'S GOT
TO NOTICE.

27:23.099 --> 27:25.142
THAT BUBBA'S
A REAL BULLY, MARY.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.352

27:26.519 --> 27:27.603
COME ON, LET'S
PLAY OVER THERE

27:27.771 --> 27:29.772

WON'T BOTHER US.

GOD-FEARING PEOPLE.

27:49.793 --> 27:52.628

EXACTLY GANGING
UP ON US.

28:00.053 --> 28:01.136
I DON'T SEE WHY NOT.

28:01.304 --> 28:06.100
A MAN COULD
HAVE EVERYTHING
HE WANTS HERE.

28:06.267 --> 28:07.935

BE FRESH EGGS
IN THAT BASKET,

28:33.044 --> 28:34.336
WOULD THEY?

28:34.504 --> 28:36.422
YES, THEY ARE.

28:36.589 --> 28:37.673
HOLD ON.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.049
LET GO OF ME!

28:39.217 --> 28:40.592
ALL I WANT TO DO
IS LOOK AT THEM EGGS.

28:40.760 --> 28:41.844
HOW DO YOU EXPECT US
TO BUY THEM

28:42.011 --> 28:43.512
IF WE DON'T CHECK
THEM OUT FIRST?

28:43.680 --> 28:44.722
THEY'RE NOT FOR SALE!

28:44.889 --> 28:47.558

HOW ABOUT THAT, SAM?

ALL THE WAY INTO TOWN,

28:49.352 --> 28:50.561
AND SHE DON'T
WANT TO SELL THEM.

DON'T HARDLY
SEEM RIGHT TO ME.

TO LET GO OF ME!

YOU'RE NOT JUST FINE.
WHAT'S WRONG?

30:38.586 --> 30:40.504

30:40.672 --> 30:42.005
ALL RIGHT,
YOU BROKE THE EGGS.

30:42.173 --> 30:46.009
YOU'RE NOT THIS UPSET
OVER THE EGGS.
WHAT HAPPENED?

30:46.177 --> 30:47.803
IT WAS MY FAULT,
CHARLES.

30:47.971 --> 30:50.180
IF I'D JUST SOLD
THEM THE EGGS LIKE
THEY WANTED ME--

30:50.348 --> 30:53.141
THEM?

30:53.309 --> 30:54.768
YOU MEAN THE GALENDERS?

30:57.730 --> 30:59.731
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT,

JUST KEEP WALKING?

39:29.700 --> 39:31.451
WELL, FINDERS KEEPERS.

39:31.619 --> 39:33.495
LOSERS WEEPERS.

39:33.662 --> 39:36.331
THAT'S MY
TABLET, BUBBA.

39:36.499 --> 39:38.708
WELL, I DON'T SEE
YOUR NAME ON IT.

39:38.876 --> 39:41.211
I SAW HIM
FIND IT.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.004
MY NAME'S RIGHT
ON THE FRONT.

39:43.172 --> 39:44.798
NOW GIVE IT BACK.

39:47.676 --> 39:49.386
YOU SAYING I CAN'T READ?

39:53.349 --> 39:55.308
I'M JUST SAYING
THAT YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BULLY ME

39:55.476 --> 39:58.853
OR ANY OTHER GIRL
AROUND HERE ANYMORE.

39:59.021 --> 40:01.314
THAT GOES
FOR ME, TOO.

40:06.195 --> 40:07.237
THERE COMES A
TIME WHEN PEOPLE

40:07.405 --> 40:09.155
HAVE TO STAND UP
FOR WHAT'S RIGHT.

40:09.323 --> 40:11.366
WE'RE NOT BACKING DOWN
TO YOU ANYMORE.

40:11.534 --> 40:13.076
WELL, YOU FIRST
BETTER GO TALK
TO YOUR PAPA,

40:13.244 --> 40:15.245
'CAUSE IF YOU
REMEMBER, MY BROTHERS
TAUGHT HIM REAL GOOD

40:15.413 --> 40:17.622
HOW TO
BELLY CRAWL.

40:57.997 --> 40:59.956
LET'S GET HIM,
LAURA!

41:00.124 --> 41:01.416
COME ON!

41:01.584 --> 41:04.711
[SHOUTING]

41:22.605 --> 41:23.938
- GOOD NIGHT, MA.
- GOOD NIGHT.

41:24.106 --> 41:26.149
GOOD NIGHT,
GIRLS.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.233
I'M SORRY
ABOUT TODAY, MA.

41:27.401 --> 41:28.818
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

41:28.986 --> 41:31.321
FROM WHAT YOU SAID,
IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU COULDN'T AVOID IT.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.782
REVEREND ALDEN'S
SURE TO THINK THAT
WE WERE WRONG, TOO, HUH?

41:34.950 --> 41:37.368
MAYBE NOT.
YOU WON. HA HA.

41:37.536 --> 41:38.661
CHARLES.

41:38.829 --> 41:40.914
SOUNDS TO ME
LIKE THEY TAUGHT
SOMEBODY A LESSON.

41:41.081 --> 41:42.790
I LEARNED ONE, TOO.

41:42.958 --> 41:44.000
THAT IF YOU
STAND TOGETHER,

41:44.168 --> 41:46.002
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE AFRAID.

41:46.170 --> 41:47.962
SHE SURE WASN'T.
YOU SHOULD HAVE
SEEN HER

41:48.130 --> 41:49.756
LAYING IT ON
TO THAT OLD BUBBA.

41:49.924 --> 41:51.007
LAURA.

41:51.175 --> 41:52.842
IT'S ONE THING
TO HAVE A FIGHT.

41:53.010 --> 41:55.929
IT'S ANOTHER TO BE
PRIDEFUL ABOUT IT.

41:56.096 --> 41:57.138
YES, MA'AM.

41:57.306 --> 41:58.681
I THINK YOU GIRLS
BETTER GET IN THE HOUSE

41:58.849 --> 41:59.933
BEFORE YOU GET A CHILL.

42:00.100 --> 42:02.477
YES, SIR.
GOOD NIGHT, PA.

42:02.645 --> 42:05.855
GOOD NIGHT.

42:06.023 --> 42:07.482
LAURA,

42:07.650 --> 42:09.817
SHE REALLY
SOCKED HIM
A GOOD ONE, HUH?

42:09.985 --> 42:11.903
SHE SURE
DID, MA.

42:12.071 --> 42:13.780
POW!

42:16.075 --> 42:20.245
I THINK I'D
BETTER HAVE HER DO
MY FIGHTING FOR ME.

42:49.942 --> 42:53.611
GOOD CHRISTIANS
ON THEIR WAY
TO CHURCH.

42:53.779 --> 42:55.280
CHARLES,
JUST DON'T
SAY ANYTHING.

43:00.035 --> 43:00.994
MORNING!

43:01.161 --> 43:02.203
Mary: MORNING,
MR. EDWARDS.

43:02.371 --> 43:03.705
- HELLO, MARY.
- GOOD MORNING, MR. EDWARDS.

43:03.872 --> 43:05.873
THERE YOU GO.
COME ON, CARRIE.

43:06.041 --> 43:07.917
GOOD MORNING,
MR. EDWARDS.

43:08.085 --> 43:09.210
HOW ARE YOU?

43:09.378 --> 43:12.046
- HELLO.
- HELLO.

43:50.419 --> 43:52.754
GOOD MORNING.

43:52.921 --> 43:53.921
WITH YOUR INDULGENCE,

43:54.089 --> 43:55.465
I WOULD LIKE TO
DISPENSE WITH THE HYMN

43:55.633 --> 44:00.136
AND GO DIRECTLY
TO MY SUBJECT
THIS MORNING--

44:00.304 --> 44:03.014
HEAVEN AND HELL.

44:03.182 --> 44:04.849
SOMETIMES WE FORGET

44:05.017 --> 44:07.602
IN OUR CONTEMPLATION
OF OUR REWARD IN HEAVEN

44:07.770 --> 44:10.521
THAT THERE
EVEN IS A HELL.

44:13.776 --> 44:16.611
BUT WE MIGHT DO
WELL THIS MORNING

44:16.779 --> 44:19.947
TO REMEMBER THAT
HELL HAS A PURPOSE, TOO.

44:20.115 --> 44:24.952
AND THE DEVIL DOESN'T SIT
DOWN THERE ALL BY HIMSELF.

44:29.958 --> 44:34.462
NOW, I'VE TOLD YOU
THAT THERE'S GOOD
IN ALL PEOPLE.

44:34.630 --> 44:38.091
BUT THAT DOESN'T
MEAN THAT ALL PEOPLE
LEAD GOOD LIVES.

44:38.258 --> 44:41.260
THERE ARE
THOSE WHO LIE,

44:41.428 --> 44:43.638
WHO STEAL...

44:43.806 --> 44:45.390
WHO ABUSE THOSE
AROUND THEM.

44:48.977 --> 44:52.397
LAST WEEK...

44:52.564 --> 44:55.191
I TOLD YOU THAT IT WAS NOBLE

44:55.359 --> 44:59.153
AND COURAGEOUS
TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK.

44:59.321 --> 45:00.488
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

45:00.656 --> 45:04.033
BUT THIS WEEK,
ONE OF YOU REMINDED ME

45:04.201 --> 45:06.994
THAT THERE ARE TIMES WHEN
THE DEVIL IS IN OUR MIDST...

45:10.249 --> 45:14.085
THAT NO ENDURANCE...

45:14.253 --> 45:15.378
NO NOBILITY
WILL DEFEND US

45:15.546 --> 45:17.171
AGAINST THOSE
WHO DO HIS BIDDING.

45:17.339 --> 45:21.968
REVEREND, ALL THAT TALK
ABOUT THE DEVIL,

45:22.136 --> 45:26.681
YOU WOULDN'T BE SLURRING
ME AND MY BROTHERS,
WOULD YOU?

45:31.437 --> 45:34.147
MORE THAN THAT...

45:36.650 --> 45:38.568
IT'S STRANGE THAT IT TOOK
THE CHILDREN OF THIS TOWN

45:38.736 --> 45:40.486
TO TEACH US THE LESSON.

45:41.572 --> 45:43.531
WE ARE A TOWN.

45:44.575 --> 45:46.159
WE'RE A COMMUNITY.

45:46.326 --> 45:48.369
WE'RE A CONGREGATION.

45:48.537 --> 45:50.872
AND NO MAN SHOULD
HAVE TO STAND ALONE

45:51.039 --> 45:54.834
AGAINST THOSE WHO
DO THE DEVIL'S WORK.

45:55.002 --> 45:57.295
WHAT ARE YOU
PLANNING TO DO,
PREACHER?

45:59.882 --> 46:01.215
I INTEND TO SEE YOU
OUT OF THIS CHURCH

46:01.383 --> 46:03.050
AND OUT OF
THIS COMMUNITY.

46:04.511 --> 46:07.722
WELL. THAT'S
PRETTY HARD WORDS,

46:07.890 --> 46:09.766
BUT IT LOOKS TO ME
LIKE YOU'RE
STILL STANDING

46:09.933 --> 46:12.643
PRETTY MUCH ALONE.

46:12.811 --> 46:14.854
[MRS. OLESON GASPS]

46:15.022 --> 46:16.397
AM I?

46:23.989 --> 46:25.573
ALL RIGHT.

46:25.741 --> 46:28.409
ALL RIGHT, WE'LL--
WE'LL BE OUT OF HERE
BY NIGHTFALL.

46:28.577 --> 46:30.745
YOU'LL GO NOW.

46:30.913 --> 46:33.080
AND YOU'LL TAKE
ONLY THOSE THINGS
YOU BROUGHT WITH YOU.

46:33.248 --> 46:35.166
MAYBE NEXT TIME
YOU'LL THINK TWICE

46:35.334 --> 46:37.084
BEFORE
YOU TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF DECENT PEOPLE.

46:37.252 --> 46:42.089
TELL HIM WE'LL DO IT,
SAM. WE'LL DO IT.

46:42.257 --> 46:43.633
ALL RIGHT.

46:46.345 --> 46:47.845
ISAIAH, YOUR MEN
CAN HANDLE THIS?

46:48.013 --> 46:49.764
AMEN, REVEREND.

46:49.932 --> 46:51.599
LET'S GO.

47:01.443 --> 47:04.821
CAROLINE, IF YOU'LL
LEAD THE LADIES IN A HYMN,
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

47:12.454 --> 47:17.124
Women:
ONWARD, CHRISTIAN SOLDIERS

47:17.292 --> 47:21.796
MARCHING AS TO WAR

47:21.964 --> 47:26.551
WITH THE CROSS OF JESUS

47:26.718 --> 47:30.888
GOING ON BEFORE...
