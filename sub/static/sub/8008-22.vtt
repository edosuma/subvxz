01:46.732 --> 01:49.986
I'm in a serious pickle,

01:50.110 --> 01:52.829
I mean, like, a really smelly, brown pickle.

01:53.196 --> 01:55.369
Don't sweat it, boy.
Finn and I got your back.

01:55.866 --> 01:57.209
Who's bullying you, Prismo?

01:57.492 --> 01:59.494
Nobody's bullying me. Look...

01:59.745 --> 02:01.998
Um, 'member when you wished
The Lich never existed

02:02.080 --> 02:03.627
and you created a new wish reality

02:03.624 --> 02:05.626
that ended up totally not working out?

02:06.001 --> 02:07.127
- No.
- vaguely, yes.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.174
What?

02:08.252 --> 02:09.675
You don't remember making that wish?

02:09.880 --> 02:10.881
Whu-huh?

02:11.006 --> 02:12.758
I thought I explained it to you that one time.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.056
Dude, I'll catch you up.

02:15.052 --> 02:16.304
Look.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.058
<i>After you wished The Lich never existed,</i>

02:18.180 --> 02:21.559
<i>you got zapped to an alternative wish reality
where magic doesn't really exist.</i>

02:21.683 --> 02:22.775
<i>FINN: Wait.</i>

02:23.185 --> 02:24.277
Who's that dude?

02:24.561 --> 02:26.814
That's you, but sort of less cool.

02:27.314 --> 02:28.941
Uh-huh. Proceed.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.817
<i>PRLSMO: So you find an old Marceline</i>

02:30.901 --> 02:33.074
<i>and the magic crown on the body
of Ice King's skeleton</i>

02:33.195 --> 02:35.914
<i>who was smooshed under the weight
of a frozen mutagenic bomb.</i>

02:36.323 --> 02:38.576
<i>But then the Destiny Gang steals
your family donkey,</i>

02:38.659 --> 02:40.707
<i>so you use the crown to become Ice Finn</i>

02:40.702 --> 02:42.545
<i>and save your donkey and your family.</i>

02:42.704 --> 02:44.706
<i>But the crown makes you crazy</i>

02:44.790 --> 02:46.838
<i>and you ice everything up like a dumb bozo,</i>

02:46.917 --> 02:50.296
<i>which sets off the mutagenic bomb
which releases the spirit of The Lich anyway.</i>

02:50.712 --> 02:53.966
But then this reality's Jake made
a counter wish

02:53.965 --> 02:55.342
which supposedly fixed the problem,

02:55.550 --> 02:57.598
but as it turns out, it didn't really.

02:58.595 --> 03:00.689
Can I just say that I don't remember
any of this stuff.

03:01.098 --> 03:03.066
Because technically it didn't happen to you.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.102
But also it still happened

03:05.102 --> 03:07.605
and that wish reality continues to exist.

03:08.939 --> 03:11.818
Is this why, all of a sudden,
one day I was way better at the flute?

03:12.234 --> 03:13.611
JAKE: Oh, yeah, I noticed that.

03:13.694 --> 03:17.824
Listen. Something really bad
is about to go down.

03:18.865 --> 03:22.836
Ice Finn is using his world's Enchiridion
to build a portal to the multiverse.

03:23.370 --> 03:25.623
We literally do not know what will happen
if he succeeds,

03:25.622 --> 03:29.126
but it could defs be catastrophic
to the architecture of these realities.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.883
Now if that happens, my boss,
let me repeat that,

03:32.254 --> 03:36.100
my boss will hold me responsible.

03:36.508 --> 03:39.261
And by proxy, y'all b0th'll be in the dip, too.

03:39.261 --> 03:41.013
Finn why not just "bloop-bloop" it all better?

03:41.263 --> 03:43.891
Something there is dampening my powers.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.143
I am losing my picks over this biz!

03:46.768 --> 03:48.611
His boss? Who's that?

03:48.979 --> 03:50.481
All right, man, what do we do?

03:51.273 --> 03:53.526
Take this and use it to take care
of the Ice Finn.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.027
Oh. Wait. What do you mean
by "take care of?"

03:56.153 --> 03:57.905

I don't think that's what we're
supposed to do.

Prismo said, "Take care of him."

04:50.248 --> 04:52.000
Yeah, that means make him feel better.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.353
Yes. The frost!

09:18.683 --> 09:20.356
(LAUGHS) Doh!

09:21.978 --> 09:23.980
Dude, don't kill him! It's me, kinda.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.823
Other Finn, just listen at me.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.613
Your name is Finn Mertens!

09:27.817 --> 09:29.114
Your best friend is Jake the dog.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.492
You have a birthmark like a flaming,
sideways teardrop...

09:31.863 --> 09:33.240
In like a really weird place.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.744
What? What's going on? Bartram?

09:36.826 --> 09:40.126
Yeah, yeah! Your whole thing is you want
to help people, remember?

09:40.205 --> 09:41.252
We can fix all this.

09:41.456 --> 09:44.130
(GRUMBLES)
It's like the most evil heartburn!

09:44.209 --> 09:45.256
FINN: Jake!

09:45.376 --> 09:46.502
Get out of the way!

09:49.589 --> 09:51.512
A man needs a maid! A man needs a maid!
A man needs a maid!

09:51.591 --> 09:53.013
<i>- (DING)</i>
- WOMAN: <i>Housekeeping.</i>

09:54.636 --> 09:55.979
(SCREAMS)

10:02.143 --> 10:03.110
(SIGHS)

10:03.853 --> 10:05.651
(PANTS, BARKS)

10:06.147 --> 10:07.148
You're welcome!

10:07.273 --> 10:09.275
Ha! I dunno what he's saying. Let's bounce.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.782
Prismo, wait!

10:11.903 --> 10:13.246
We have so much to talk about.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.163
Oh.

10:17.158 --> 10:20.753
Prismo, I'm sorry if this is breaking the rules,
but you got to help this guy out.

10:21.037 --> 10:23.381
He's just always gonna be messed
up with that crown around.

10:23.665 --> 10:27.010
PRISMO: Okay, I can try
rearranging some stuff.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.011
- (MOUSE CLICKS)
- PRISMO: Just a quick cut...

10:29.671 --> 10:31.799
And... Paste!

10:32.507 --> 10:36.512
There! Now the ground zero bomb explosion
should destroy the crown in that reality...

10:36.678 --> 10:38.146
And... Play.

10:39.013 --> 10:40.686
<i>PRXSMO". So, yeah. This all goes down again...</i>

10:40.932 --> 10:42.684
<i>Bomb goes off... (EXCLAIMS)</i>

10:42.892 --> 10:45.190
<i>So, yeah. The crown is totally gone.</i>

10:48.273 --> 10:50.196
<i>Your guy here goes back to normal.</i>

10:54.070 --> 10:55.572
Aww. (CHOMPING)

11:01.953 --> 11:03.830
FINN: Huh, that's his family.

11:04.914 --> 11:06.541
Hey, look how dumb I am in that world.

11:06.708 --> 11:08.085
Here's me... (BARKS)

11:08.168 --> 11:10.466
(CHORTLES) I eat stuff off the ground.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.338
I dunno, what are dogs even into these days?

11:14.841 --> 11:18.971
<i>Come along with me</i>

11:18.970 --> 11:22.941
<i>And the butterflies and bees</i>

11:26.102 --> 11:27.945
This party is so crazy!
