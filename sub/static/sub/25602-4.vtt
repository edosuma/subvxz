00:27.680 --> 00:29.466
How?
All I need is a Green pool.

00:29.560 --> 00:30.663
You think
there's more Green here?

00:30.800 --> 00:33.985

No.

01:59.160 --> 02:01.720
Can you do this
without Armada supplies?

02:01.800 --> 02:03.301
Pretty much everything I need
is on that table.

Oh, except lube.

I started delivering calves
when I was 12.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.509
It's all about the tiny hands.

John's doing great.

02:51.160 --> 02:52.627
He misses you.

02:53.920 --> 02:56.559
Why does he keep doing
that head-banging thing?

02:56.640 --> 02:57.902
Concussive stimulation.

02:58.000 --> 02:59.024
That parasite is causing

02:59.120 --> 03:01.702
a massive secondary inflammation
in his brain right now.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.382
Hitting himself seems
to relieve the pressure.

03:04.520 --> 03:05.589
Great.

03:05.840 --> 03:08.343
Great, so everything's
under control.

03:08.440 --> 03:09.987
How's Dutch doing?
Still unconscious.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.980
Delle Seyah?
I wish she was unconscious.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.741
Okay, tell me the truth.

03:14.920 --> 03:16.979
How long does John have
until we can't cure him?

03:17.080 --> 03:20.743
I don't know. But time
Isn't our only problem.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.019
Whatever happened to the pool
on the prison planet

03:23.160 --> 03:24.980

Don't know.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.865
Proximity, contamination...
Wait, wait, so,

03:29.000 --> 03:30.820
all the plasma we have
is frozen.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.467
I wouldn't call it frozen.

03:32.560 --> 03:34.300
It's just solid.

03:34.480 --> 03:36.698

Hullen margaritas.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.984
Okay, well,
that simplifies shit.

03:39.080 --> 03:40.627
We just need
to get to the Armada

03:40.720 --> 03:42.745
and hope like hell they have some
of John's source plasma left

03:42.840 --> 03:43.864
so we can cleanse him.

12:04.440 --> 12:05.987
Can you give him
drugs, please?

12:06.120 --> 12:08.782
ZEPH: If you two are done bickering,
I could use some help over here.

12:09.400 --> 12:10.424
Okay-

12:10.640 --> 12:13.427
Once I make the incision, I need you
to clamp this sucker open fast.

12:13.520 --> 12:14.987
Let me know
if you feel any pain.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.422
Okay, but you know I won't.

12:16.520 --> 12:19.466
Not _unless cheekbones over there
deCIdes to open hIS mouth again.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.419
On three. One...

12:23.080 --> 12:25.059
Two... Three.

12:25.200 --> 12:27.020
Let's make a baby.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.663
Holy shit.
ZEPH: Did you just see that?

12:35.320 --> 12:37.777
All right, enough whispering,
you old maids. What?

12:37.880 --> 12:40.303
The pregnancy hormones must be
speeding up the healing response.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.379
I can't hold the incision
open long enough.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.266
I can't even make an incision.

12:44.680 --> 12:46.898
I don't know how
to get this baby out of you.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.103
I see.

12:54.360 --> 12:58.467
I could really use
that drink right now, please.

13:10.160 --> 13:11.263
Johnny.

13:12.120 --> 13:13.667
It's me. It's Dutch.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.737
I know who you are.

13:17.320 --> 13:18.821
Then look at me, please.

13:25.240 --> 13:27.982
I brought you some water.
I don't know if it helps.

13:29.560 --> 13:32.199
Dutch, I'm Hullen,
not dehydrated.

13:32.840 --> 13:33.864
Yeah.

13:35.560 --> 13:38.267
I think there's something
you're supposed to tell me.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.059
A message from Khlyen.

13:42.360 --> 13:44.464
Lady, you really need
to see a doctor

13:44.560 --> 13:47.302
about your daddy issues.
Johnny, focus. Please.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.981
I don't need to focus.

13:49.200 --> 13:52.977
I know exactly what Daddy dearest
wants me to say. Just...

13:55.480 --> 13:58.665
Let me out,
and I will tell you.

13:59.560 --> 14:00.697
No, thanks.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.920
Hullen or human,
I know when you're lying.

14:06.560 --> 14:07.697
Why?

14:09.200 --> 14:10.701
Because you're my real friend?

14:10.840 --> 14:11.864
Yes.

14:14.480 --> 14:15.617
(LAUGHS)

14:20.160 --> 14:23.266
If you were my real friend,
you never would have left.

14:23.920 --> 14:25.945
And this never
would have happened.

14:28.040 --> 14:29.701
Is that a lie?

14:31.520 --> 14:32.623
No.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.060
It's not even the worst thing
I've screwed up lately,

14:36.160 --> 14:37.297
but I'm gonna fix it.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.340
All of it.
Really?

14:41.440 --> 14:43.021
You think that you can?

14:44.320 --> 14:45.309
Yes.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.740
I'm sorry, darling.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.264
But I can _tell
when you're lyIng, too.

14:59.400 --> 15:02.699
What are you hiding,
Yalena Yardeen?

15:08.800 --> 15:11.018
Why did you run
from the ruins?

15:11.720 --> 15:13.745
Khlyen wanted me
to face The Lady.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.829
H ow?

15:19.080 --> 15:21.059
What's taking him so long?

15:21.160 --> 15:22.479
We're not safe here.

15:22.560 --> 15:24.380
What, you think
we're safe out there?

15:25.040 --> 15:27.144
You need to get out
of the Green while you can.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.109
Great.

15:30.960 --> 15:32.621
I'm open to suggestions.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.344
That's your party trick,
remember? Not mine.

15:35.440 --> 15:37.101
We're two of a kind.

15:37.200 --> 15:40.624
Maybe whatever I can do
in the Green, you can too.

15:41.760 --> 15:44.263
Khlyen always protects you.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.625
He wouldn't have
sent you to The Lady

15:46.840 --> 15:49.980
unless he knew there was a
way you could escape her.

15:52.560 --> 15:53.777
Think.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.145
The story.
What?

16:01.240 --> 16:02.559
I remember.

16:03.760 --> 16:07.059
I was supposed to talk
to Johnny about something

16:07.160 --> 16:08.229
when I get out.

16:08.360 --> 16:09.987
Something about
Khlyen's story.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.184
Maybe he was telling you
a way out.

16:12.400 --> 16:14.300
Hidden in the story.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.819
Do you remember
what it was about?

16:18.760 --> 16:20.079
Yes, I do.

16:21.600 --> 16:25.184
But also, so should you.

16:25.760 --> 16:28.024
I know you're not Aneela.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.947
Did you really think
I was this stupid?

16:34.680 --> 16:36.466
Honestly?

16:36.880 --> 16:38.745
I really did.

16:40.880 --> 16:44.782
Oh, we're going
to have so much fun.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.109
(CHUCKLES)

16:51.520 --> 16:52.782
SEYAH: All right, that's it.
I want a new doctor.

16:52.880 --> 16:55.019
Any new doctor.
I know it's crazy,

16:55.120 --> 16:57.099
but it's the only solution
I can think of.

16:57.200 --> 16:58.588
It's just basic transfusion.

16:58.680 --> 17:00.261
It won't cleanse you,
but ifI can weaken

17:00.360 --> 17:02.339
your Hullen response,
I think we have a shot

17:02.440 --> 17:04.146
at successful surgery.

17:04.640 --> 17:06.585
You have that magic pony
repulsion skill with plasma.

17:06.680 --> 17:10.138
I've been reading
John's files on Sabine.

17:10.240 --> 17:12.549
Wait, who?
Hullen sleeper agent. I...

17:12.920 --> 17:14.501
Weakened her Hullen side.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.382
Did you literally bore her
into wishing she could die?

17:17.520 --> 17:19.738
Actually, he banged
the Green out of her.

17:19.840 --> 17:20.829
Hmm.

17:21.360 --> 17:23.305
Sex does sometimes
help with labor.

17:23.400 --> 17:25.664
Okay. No.

17:25.760 --> 17:27.625
I will take
the transfusion instead.

17:27.720 --> 17:28.709
Suit yourself.
D'AVIN: You know what?

17:29.040 --> 17:30.223
Maybe I'm not even interested.

17:30.400 --> 17:31.662
Stop.
You're embarrassing yourself.

17:31.760 --> 17:32.943
How will I know
if it's working?

17:33.040 --> 17:34.541
I'm not feeling... (GASPS)

17:34.760 --> 17:35.863
Whoa.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.302
What the hells is that?

17:37.400 --> 17:38.742
I think
it's called childbirth.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.479
(GROANS) Well, knock it off.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.346
What are we, monkeys?
This is good.

17:43.440 --> 17:45.067
If you're feeling pain,
it means it's working.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.799
Delle Seyah, look at me.
Pain is just a state of mind.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.319
State of mind...

17:53.560 --> 17:55.027
I feel cold.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.420
Why is it so cold?
ZEPH: That's normal.

17:57.520 --> 17:59.659
When labor hits
the tranSItIonal stage, you...

17:59.800 --> 18:01.222
(ALARMS BEEPING)

18:05.520 --> 18:07.226
D'AVIN: Is that normal?
Shit.

18:07.480 --> 18:08.469
Blood pressure's dropping.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.777
Both heart _rates
are crashing.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.097
Whatever your
magic pony powers are,

18:11.200 --> 18:12.383
they're not just
affecting Delle Seyah.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.469
They're affecting the baby.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.342
Okay, you need to stop this.

18:16.440 --> 18:17.987
If we stop now,
we may never get it out.

18:21.720 --> 18:23.745
It's not our call to make,
and she's not able to make it.

18:23.840 --> 18:25.341
Disconnect her.

18:26.560 --> 18:27.982
(HEART RATE DECREASES)

18:28.080 --> 18:29.468
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

18:32.080 --> 18:33.707
Okay, I think we're good.

18:35.080 --> 18:36.468
(SIGHS IN RELIEF)

18:39.920 --> 18:41.387
(EERIE WHISPERING)

18:43.600 --> 18:44.737
Listen...

18:44.840 --> 18:47.149
Break into. . .
L/sten...

18:47.400 --> 18:48.947
Listen...
Break into. . .

18:49.320 --> 18:50.708
What are you doing?

18:53.080 --> 18:55.139
Hey! Hey, um...

18:55.720 --> 18:57.039
What are you doing here?

18:57.120 --> 18:58.303
I thought you were, like,
grounded, or something.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.300
Pip.
Right.

19:01.520 --> 19:03.897
Since I have you here, um...

19:04.000 --> 19:05.547
You seem really
close with Johnny.

19:05.640 --> 19:06.777
Did you ever take that
to, like, another place?

19:06.880 --> 19:08.222
Out.
Okay.

19:09.120 --> 19:11.065
Just asking for a friend.

19:24.120 --> 19:25.940
It was good to be home, Luce.

19:33.440 --> 19:35.579
LUCY: Are you sure
you want me to do that; Dutch?

19:42.720 --> 19:44.460
(PANTING)

19:54.920 --> 19:58.060
KHL YE/V: But you 7/ always
end up right back here.

20:04.880 --> 20:07.019
You think a new face
would work any better?

20:07.120 --> 20:08.337
Let's find out.

20:08.960 --> 20:13.738
This one seems special to you,
as does this place.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.819
The harem where I grew up.
How do you know about it?

20:15.960 --> 20:17.029
You.

20:17.520 --> 20:18.623
You gave me all your memories

20:18.720 --> 20:20.108
when you forced Aneela's hand
into the Green.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.462
Thank you for that,
by the way.

20:21.640 --> 20:23.221
Filled in a_lot
of mISSIng pieces.

20:23.320 --> 20:24.537
But not all of it.

20:24.840 --> 20:26.387
There are things
that you don't know,

20:26.480 --> 20:28.300
like how to get out of here.
True.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.866
But then again, little bird,
neither do you.

20:46.400 --> 20:48.265
Well done, you.

20:48.680 --> 20:52.104
It's been such a long time
since I was surprised.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.019
I admit, you surprised me.

20:55.120 --> 20:57.759
Compliment not accepted,
you creepy stalker.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.024
I appreciate your pluck.
I really do.

21:00.320 --> 21:02.743
It's one of the few things
I admire about humans.

21:02.840 --> 21:04.182
And I admire
the Hullens' ability

21:04.280 --> 21:06.464
to be the biggest
gaping assholes in the room.

21:06.720 --> 21:07.709
HuHen?

21:09.200 --> 21:10.542
Oh, child.

21:10.960 --> 21:15.226
I am much, much
older than that.

21:16.320 --> 21:18.265
What are you?
Patient.

21:20.640 --> 21:22.460
Hullen are my tools.

21:22.800 --> 21:25.746
So is Khlyen and Aneela.

21:25.960 --> 21:28.463
Soon it will be you.
I wouldn't count on it.

21:28.560 --> 21:29.902
I didn't play well
with others.

21:30.000 --> 21:31.581
Yes, I can see that.

21:32.040 --> 21:33.746
I can see most things in here.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.660
The Green is a memory pool.

21:36.640 --> 21:40.383
_ But then I noticed_ _
certain memories were mISS|ng,

21:41.200 --> 21:42.542
edited out.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.580
A moment here, a face there.

21:46.760 --> 21:50.309
Snip, snip, snip.

21:51.600 --> 21:53.545
Until there was a void.

21:55.720 --> 21:58.177
You are the void.

21:59.440 --> 22:01.817
Khlyen hid you from me.
I need to know why.

22:02.640 --> 22:04.904
You're not as smart
as you think you are.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.265
And you are not as strong
as they need you to be.

22:23.080 --> 22:24.399
How's She doing?

22:24.760 --> 22:26.580
Stable, but it won't
stay that way.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.699
This is a Band-Aid,
not a solution.

22:30.520 --> 22:32.465
Lucy,
what's our ETA
on the Quad?

22:32.560 --> 22:34.699
LUCY: We ’re no longer
heading for the Quad

22:34.840 --> 22:36.580
Dutch has changed course.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.223
What are you doing?

22:53.080 --> 22:54.741
Saving John.
So are we,

22:54.840 --> 22:56.159
which is why we're headed
for the Armada.

22:56.240 --> 22:57.662
The Armada's too far.

22:57.880 --> 22:59.017
John's map says
that there's a moon

22:59.120 --> 23:00.667
with a Green pool
within minutes from here.

23:00.760 --> 23:03.342
What good is some
random pool to Johnny?

23:05.600 --> 23:07.579
Dutch, what is going on
with you?

23:07.680 --> 23:09.068
LUCY: We ’ve arrived
at the coordinates,

23:09.240 --> 23:11.185
but there appears to be
an anomaly.

23:11.320 --> 23:13.140
What anomaly?
Initial scans indicate

23:13.240 --> 23:15.549
no presence
of the Hullen parasite.

23:15.640 --> 23:16.959
The pool /s inactive.

23:17.120 --> 23:18.860
But it's on
John's plasma maps.

23:19.080 --> 23:21.025
Is it frozen,
like the pool I came out of?

23:21.120 --> 23:23.907
V/sua/ indicators are positive
for crystallization.

23:25.040 --> 23:27.782
Lucy,
show me John's map of all
the plasma pools in The J.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.141
_ Which_ones
still have active plasma?

23:33.280 --> 23:34.599
It's frozen.

23:35.120 --> 23:36.747
All of it. Everywhere.

23:36.920 --> 23:38.137
If there's no more plasma,
how the hells

23:38.240 --> 23:40.105
are we gonna cleanse John?

23:46.120 --> 23:47.462
Uh-oh.

23:48.600 --> 23:50.909
Mommy and Daddy.
This isn't good.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.585
If you're not gonna take 'em off,
can you at least loosen them up?

23:54.680 --> 23:55.783
They're rubbing me raw.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.620
I think I'll stay
here for now.

23:57.880 --> 23:59.507
You don't trust me?

23:59.600 --> 24:01.147
That's fair.

24:01.240 --> 24:03.663
You do realize that I...
We can't fix you, Johnny.

24:08.320 --> 24:09.901
Is this a test?
No.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.901
'Cause if this is a test, I think
I'm done being your guinea pig.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.787
Finish what you started.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.138
We can't.
Bullshit!

24:19.400 --> 24:20.947
Prego said that she could.

24:21.040 --> 24:23.497
That there's plasma on the
Armada that could fix me.

24:23.600 --> 24:24.624
It's gone.

24:25.320 --> 24:29.700
All the Green pools, all the
plasma, it's solidified.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.826
This is your fault.

24:39.360 --> 24:40.827
Isn't it?

24:43.080 --> 24:47.380

to be caught in between.

24:48.200 --> 24:52.785
Well, I can't stand looking at
your beautiful damn face anymore.

24:57.000 --> 24:58.945
Because it hurts.

25:00.040 --> 25:04.943
My heart, it keeps switching
from Hullen to human.

25:05.120 --> 25:10.103
And I keep losing you, both of
you, over and over again.

25:11.000 --> 25:12.319
And I don't even care

25:12.400 --> 25:16.382
which one I am anymore,
but I cannot live in between.

25:19.400 --> 25:21.539
I'm so sorry.

25:22.720 --> 25:23.857
Are you sad?

25:24.120 --> 25:25.940
Is that hard to hear?

25:27.600 --> 25:29.101
Then end this.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.303
You coward.

25:32.400 --> 25:34.379
I am not giving up hope.

of old memories.

26:23.960 --> 26:25.700
None of it's real.
None of it matters!

26:25.800 --> 26:28.223
That's the beautiful thing
about human minds.

26:28.600 --> 26:31.706
You don't just remember
faces, places.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.384
You remember how you felt.

26:36.440 --> 26:38.499
You remember pain.

26:41.440 --> 26:42.657
Agony.

26:45.680 --> 26:46.669
Shame.

Oh. Grief.

26:54.880 --> 26:57.542
And I can trap you in your
worst memories forever.

No.
No, what?

27:03.880 --> 27:06.622
No, thank you.

27:08.560 --> 27:09.584
See?

27:10.840 --> 27:12.865
Memories aren'tjust
where you've been.

27:13.480 --> 27:14.697
They're who you are.

27:15.480 --> 27:18.222
And if I own that, I own you.

27:18.520 --> 27:21.307

27:39.440 --> 27:41.385
Why are you stopping?
You see that?

27:41.760 --> 27:43.546
Knife. I need a knife.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.424
What are you doing?

27:48.560 --> 27:49.902
Trying to stop the break
from healing.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.137
What the hells for,

27:51.240 --> 27:53.822
Look. The parasite

his spinal column,

27:55.360 --> 27:56.463
_ it must have _
triggered something.

27:56.560 --> 27:58.107
IfI can hold the knife
in long enough

27:58.200 --> 27:59.417
and the parasite
dies completely,

27:59.520 --> 28:01.067
he'll be cleansed.
And dead.

What's up?

28:48.000 --> 28:49.865
Holy shit.
I can't believe that worked.

Anyone have a mint?

29:04.920 --> 29:06.945
Have showers always
felt this good?

I don't know,
but that's your sixth.

whatever you did while Hullen.

You had no choice.

I gotta admit,

29:41.360 --> 29:43.260
there were a few
enjoyable moments.

Yeah, not so much

30:02.360 --> 30:04.021
Something about you.

30:06.360 --> 30:07.861
Where are my manners?

You must be parched.

Why John Jaqobis?

And she went back
to that story over and over.

30:57.520 --> 30:59.624
I broke, Johnny.

31:02.040 --> 31:04.986
She was inside me.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.778
She knows everything,

31:10.280 --> 31:13.386
except why Khlyen
told me that story,

31:14.360 --> 31:17.386
why he said to find you.

31:19.240 --> 31:21.060
What does that mean?

31:31.920 --> 31:34.297
SEYAH”. Where is Dutch?

31:34.680 --> 31:37.626
This is ridiculous. She
can't hide from me forever.

31:41.680 --> 31:45.229
My baby's trying to split me in half,
and you're offering me ice chips?

31:45.480 --> 31:49.985

my dearest friends in my bar.

32:03.160 --> 32:05.344
Who's ready to have
this fat-ass baby?

32:05.440 --> 32:07.544
Because I am 92% sure
I can replicate

32:07.640 --> 32:09.028
what happened to John
and make it happen here.

32:09.120 --> 32:10.940
If you say enema,
I will kill you.

32:11.080 --> 32:12.297
Right.
Forgot you weren't there.

32:12.400 --> 32:15.267
So basically,
I severed John's Spinal cord

32:15.360 --> 32:17.419
_to cleanse him
Without killing him.

32:17.760 --> 32:19.261
Sorry, what?
The Hullen parasite

32:19.360 --> 32:21.100
lives in the brain.
It must need to be

32:21.200 --> 32:22.622
in constant contact
with the host's body

32:22.720 --> 32:24.699
in some kind
of bio-feedback loop.

be Hullen anymore.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.821
Yeah. I'm also saying

32:32.920 --> 32:35.263
you'll still be alive,
and so will the baby.

is better than nothing.

Yes. Where is Dutch?

get this baby out.

32:45.280 --> 32:46.599

that you do make it out

into my world,
'cause whatever you are,

33:36.120 --> 33:38.543
I'm going to enjoy
making you bleed there.

33:39.800 --> 33:43.224
Or maybe I've planned
a human welcome party.

33:43.400 --> 33:47.097
Hmm? Maybe I have something
special waiting for me outside.

33:47.600 --> 33:48.589
Hmm?

33:50.400 --> 33:52.061
What's waiting for you?

33:53.480 --> 33:54.981
Better question.

33:55.800 --> 33:58.826
Would you like to see
what's waiting for you?

34:08.760 --> 34:10.148

like what you see?

34:11.800 --> 34:13.939
Oh, you can run,
little flea.

34:14.880 --> 34:18.065
But you'll always end up
right back here.

34:31.200 --> 34:34.897
I think it's time we had
a talk, just us girls.

34:36.200 --> 34:38.862
Where iS Aneela?

34:43.600 --> 34:44.783
What do you want,

34:44.880 --> 34:46.745
Out. I want
out of this Ship.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.660
I want this baby
out of my belly.

34:48.760 --> 34:50.307
And I want to know
what you did to Aneela.

34:50.440 --> 34:51.623
Okay-

we're in the middle of space.

of where we are.

34:58.720 --> 35:01.280
to get that baby out.
Have you heard how?

35:01.360 --> 35:04.545
And three, let her go.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.819
You're really gonna
risk your child over Dutch?

35:06.920 --> 35:09.184
You really gonna risk
finding out?

35:14.440 --> 35:16.305
Kill me here,
or kill me in there.

35:16.400 --> 35:17.947
Isn't much_ of a choice.
We're trying to help.

35:18.040 --> 35:19.701
I don't want your help.
I want...

35:19.800 --> 35:21.779
I need to see Aneela.
Sorry, you can't.

35:21.880 --> 35:23.381
Why not?
What did you do to her?

35:23.480 --> 35:24.822
Where iS She?

35:25.560 --> 35:27.585
She's trapped in the Green
because I left her there.

You what?
Maybe not the best way

35:29.400 --> 35:30.742
to ole-escalate
a situation, Dutch.

35:30.840 --> 35:32.944
But I'm gonna go back.
What have you done?

35:33.080 --> 35:34.468
She needs to be here now.

35:34.560 --> 35:35.549
Look, I know
how alone you feel...

35:35.640 --> 35:36.629
Do I need to crash the ship

35:36.720 --> 35:38.745
just to make you Shut up?

35:39.640 --> 35:42.382
This child isn'tjust
part of me or him.

35:42.640 --> 35:43.777
It's part ofAneela.

35:43.880 --> 35:45.222
Do you understand
what that means?

35:45.440 --> 35:46.623
It's unique.

35:47.040 --> 35:50.862
How are you or any of us going
to protect it without her?

35:51.000 --> 35:53.377
Protect it from who?
The Lady.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.586
That's what she was
talking about

35:56.680 --> 35:58.307
when she said something
was waiting for her.

35:58.400 --> 36:00.823
Aneela thought her experiments
were for her father.

36:01.160 --> 36:02.821
When she realized
who they were really for,

36:02.920 --> 36:04.785
she knew enough to be afraid.

36:05.640 --> 36:08.143
Do you?
Listen, Delle Seyah.

36:08.560 --> 36:12.701
I will find my way back to Aneela,
and I will save her. I swear.

36:13.040 --> 36:14.905
And why would you do that
for her?

36:15.400 --> 36:17.379
Because she saved me.

36:49.720 --> 36:52.507
You shouldn't be doing this
on your own, Yala.

36:52.600 --> 36:55.307
I didn't give you life
just so you can throw it away.

36:55.640 --> 36:57.460
It's you.

36:57.560 --> 36:59.346
It's really you.

37:00.520 --> 37:02.499
YALA: I tried to stop her.

37:02.960 --> 37:05.463
She's too strong. She's...

37:05.600 --> 37:08.342
She's everywhere.
I know.

37:08.440 --> 37:10.226
That's why you have to go.

37:10.360 --> 37:12.260
But you can't
fight her alone.

37:12.600 --> 37:14.227
Maybe not.

37:14.600 --> 37:20.220
But I can keep her in here
so you can stop her out there.

37:35.960 --> 37:37.541
Are you ready?

37:40.760 --> 37:42.307
So much like her.

All right.

even know it happened...

38:04.880 --> 38:07.906
Be careful.
Be brutal. Go.

38:17.920 --> 38:19.057

38:49.160 --> 38:51.617
You did it.
He did nothing.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.904
(BABY CRYING)

38:59.240 --> 39:01.947
Okay, you can
take him now.

39:06.320 --> 39:08.538
(BABY (zooms)

39:13.120 --> 39:14.337
Hi.

39:22.040 --> 39:24.941
JOHN: Have you thought
about names yet?

39:25.480 --> 39:27.061
D'AVIN: Why don't you just
make me a drink?

39:27.240 --> 39:29.822
For your head.
Doctor's orders.

39:30.680 --> 39:32.705
So now that
Delle Seyah's a human,

39:32.800 --> 39:36.179
you're not gonna, you know,
try and kill her, are you?

39:39.000 --> 39:40.183
She had a rough day.

39:41.480 --> 39:43.539
She gets one free shot.

39:43.680 --> 39:44.863
One.

39:49.880 --> 39:50.949
Dutch?

39:53.600 --> 39:57.661
Listen, I owe all of you
a story about where I've been.

39:59.720 --> 40:02.177
At first,
it was just me...

40:03.800 --> 40:04.903
And Aneela...

40:07.600 --> 40:08.783
And Khlyen

40:09.040 --> 40:10.143
in the Green.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.979
And then The Lady came.

40:14.400 --> 40:16.220
She's the real enemy here.

40:17.200 --> 40:18.861
So do you know
how to beat her?

40:18.960 --> 40:19.949
No.

40:21.320 --> 40:23.060
But I know how it ends.

40:23.640 --> 40:27.019
Would you like to see
what's waiting for you?

40:38.360 --> 40:40.999
Please. Please, Johnny!

40:41.080 --> 40:43.389
It's me! Dutch!

40:43.840 --> 40:45.660
Who the hells iS Johnny?

40:46.640 --> 40:47.902
No.

40:50.920 --> 40:52.308
We lose.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.865
Is this supposed
to be a pep talk?

40:59.960 --> 41:01.746
Dutch, whatever some
Hullen bitch told you...

41:01.840 --> 41:03.307
She's not Hullen.

41:03.640 --> 41:06.905
I don't know what she is
or how to stop her yet.

41:08.880 --> 41:11.860
But I know she'll make her
move now that I'm out.

41:31.880 --> 41:34.223
Khlyen gave us
what we need to fight her.

41:34.320 --> 41:36.140
Yeah, we just need to figure
out what the hells that iS.

41:36.240 --> 41:37.309
We Will.

41:38.440 --> 41:40.305
If you're with me.

41:41.640 --> 41:43.380
The Ferran
have a saying,

41:43.560 --> 41:46.905
when you choose your family,
you choose your fight.

41:49.920 --> 41:51.182
So we fight.

41:52.920 --> 41:54.023
One question.

41:54.160 --> 41:56.742
If this Lady's in the Green
and all the Green is frozen,

41:56.840 --> 41:58.865
why not just let them
stay that way, keep her in?

41:59.000 --> 42:00.501
Because Aneela's strong.

42:01.120 --> 42:02.667
But she will break.

42:13.280 --> 42:15.419
No one's coming
to save you.

42:16.280 --> 42:19.147
If you don't give me a way
out, you're locked in here...

42:19.720 --> 42:21.267
With me.

42:21.920 --> 42:24.502
You're also locked
in here With me.

42:28.240 --> 42:30.265
And who's going to save you?

42:35.560 --> 42:37.937
DUTCH: And if The Lady
gets past Aneela. . .

42:38.760 --> 42:40.546
Let's begin.

42:42.320 --> 42:43.742
DUTCH:
She’s coming for all of us.
