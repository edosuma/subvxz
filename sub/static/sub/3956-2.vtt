00:00.805 --> 00:05.820
An offer to read English
at Bristol is fantastic, Rae.

00:05.920 --> 00:07.900
I'm not going.

00:07.959 --> 00:10.959
Move in. Here, with me?

00:10.959 --> 00:13.958
It's never too late to be what
you might have been.

00:13.959 --> 00:15.518
Why would you lie to me?

00:15.519 --> 00:17.838
Finn! Well, what about the party?

00:17.839 --> 00:20.079
I'm not really in the mood.

00:22.639 --> 00:26.038
We are going to have the flat-warming
party. It is back on!

00:26.039 --> 00:27.318
I need you to come with me.

00:27.319 --> 00:28.599
It's a lock-in!

00:30.599 --> 00:32.558
Yeah!

00:32.558 --> 00:33.639
Chloe!

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074

00:55.519 --> 00:58.879
I think we should do a rota,
so that someone's always here.

00:58.880 --> 01:02.239
I'll go first. Just make sure
I'm back for three.

01:02.239 --> 01:05.958
Got to take Rita to the
park to do a shit.

01:05.959 --> 01:08.238
Me dad's dog.

01:08.239 --> 01:10.878
Well, if you're staying,
I'm staying. Maybe I should stay.

01:10.879 --> 01:13.598
Well, we can't all stay.
What sort of rota's that?

01:13.599 --> 01:16.038
Guys...

01:16.039 --> 01:18.758
It's OK. I'll do it.

01:18.759 --> 01:21.238
You go and get some rest.

01:21.239 --> 01:24.678
What's going on?

01:24.679 --> 01:26.701
What's happened?

02:08.878 --> 02:12.879
So why were you all in the car
together? Where were you going?

02:14.519 --> 02:17.558
Rae?

02:17.559 --> 02:19.438
We were going to yours.

02:19.439 --> 02:21.878
Why?

02:21.879 --> 02:24.758
For the party. What party?

02:24.759 --> 02:27.559
The flat-warming party. No!
We discussed that.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.319
I said it wasn't happening.

02:30.319 --> 02:33.838
But I said that it was.

02:33.839 --> 02:36.759
I wanted to talk.

02:36.759 --> 02:40.358
I needed to see you
and I couldn't do it on my own.

02:40.359 --> 02:44.359
Let's talk. I can't.

02:46.399 --> 02:50.158
Don't you get it, Finn?
She's in here because of me. No!

02:50.159 --> 02:51.598
She's not in here because of...

02:51.599 --> 02:55.599
Rae?

03:00.439 --> 03:04.439
You must be knackered. You go home
and I'll wait here, all right?

03:11.959 --> 03:14.678
I'll have Karim stick
the kettle on.

03:14.679 --> 03:17.239
That's if he can be bothered to
get off his backside.

03:17.239 --> 03:20.118
Ever since the council threatened to
cut jobs in traffic control,

03:20.119 --> 03:23.278
he's barely moved a muscle.

03:23.279 --> 03:26.598
Even in bed. That's not normal, Rae.

03:26.599 --> 03:28.038
Not with a Bedouin.

03:28.039 --> 03:31.039
Meant to spend half of that between
your thighs.

03:34.399 --> 03:37.679
Oh! Oh, come on, love.
Chloe's going to be OK.

03:40.439 --> 03:41.838
Bloody typical!

03:41.839 --> 03:43.958
He's done nothing for Monday.

03:43.959 --> 03:46.078
The big 4-5.

03:46.079 --> 03:47.638
What?

03:47.639 --> 03:50.678
It's my birthday, Rae! I'm 45.

03:50.679 --> 03:53.958
Yeah, I know it's your birthday. But
why are you saying it like that?

03:53.959 --> 03:56.798
Like what? Like it's
a well-known thing.

03:56.799 --> 03:59.678
It's a milestone, Rae. No, it isn't.

03:59.679 --> 04:01.638
It's halfway between two milestones.

04:01.639 --> 04:05.238
Well, whatever it is, it's
slipped his mind, that's the point.

04:05.239 --> 04:09.239
Even your father used to sing Happy
Birthday to me once in a while.

04:13.839 --> 04:16.478
Right, you go on upstairs.

04:16.478 --> 04:20.478
I'll be up in a minute.

04:24.319 --> 04:28.319
Dear Diary, to be in a car crash,
you first have to be in a car.

04:28.439 --> 04:31.838
And the gang being in that car,
that was down to me.

04:31.839 --> 04:35.839
Chloe being in hospital,
that was down to me.

04:36.399 --> 04:40.399
My weakness causes damage.

04:44.599 --> 04:48.279
Finn called. He said to call him
back on his home phone.

04:50.279 --> 04:52.318
I found those downstairs.

04:52.319 --> 04:56.319
Have a rest. And, when you wake up,
maybe you can have a look.

04:57.759 --> 05:00.318
Can't.

05:00.319 --> 05:04.319
Chloe wouldn't want you to stop
with your studies, would she?

05:05.759 --> 05:07.078
"No, Mum.

05:07.079 --> 05:10.239
"I need to pass my exams,
so I can still go to Bristol."

05:31.999 --> 05:34.478
Why didn't people tell you
when they were coming round?

05:34.479 --> 05:37.119
That way, you wouldn't have to answer
the door looking like

05:37.120 --> 05:40.199
Joseph and his
technicolor dreamcoat.

05:42.639 --> 05:46.279
I don't get it. You can't force
someone to drive.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.118
I did.

05:48.119 --> 05:50.638
Now her parents hate me.
They won't hate you.

05:50.639 --> 05:52.878
Her mum does.

05:52.879 --> 05:56.879
She looked at me like I was
Myra Hindley in a long, black wig.

05:58.799 --> 06:01.158
And what about you? What do you
mean?

06:01.159 --> 06:03.398
Well, the whole of Stamford is
worried about Chloe,

06:03.399 --> 06:04.638
but how are you feeling?

06:04.639 --> 06:07.518
I don't think anyone's worried
about me, to be honest.

06:07.519 --> 06:10.438
Well, I am. That's why I'm here,
stupid.

06:10.439 --> 06:14.439
I need to keep tabs on my new
Bristol buddy, remember?

06:16.599 --> 06:19.358
Can I offer you some advice, Rae?

06:19.359 --> 06:22.878
From someone who has done her fair
share of sitting about at home

06:22.879 --> 06:26.879
in sexy dressing gowns.

06:28.879 --> 06:31.558
It's OK to feel shit about yourself.

06:31.559 --> 06:34.478
For a bit,
it's totally understandable.

06:34.479 --> 06:38.318
But it's not fair of her
parents to blame you.

06:38.319 --> 06:40.838
You need to get out there...

06:40.839 --> 06:43.758
and prove they've got you wrong.

06:43.759 --> 06:47.759
Your her best mate. She needs you.

06:49.399 --> 06:50.878
Katie Springer was right.

06:50.879 --> 06:53.478
I had to stop sitting around
feeling sorry for myself

06:53.479 --> 06:56.078
and do something to help Chloe.

06:56.079 --> 06:58.558
And that could only begin with
a surprise visit

06:58.559 --> 07:02.039
to the headquarters of the official
Rae Earle Fan Club.

07:03.719 --> 07:07.719
Mr Gemmel, I...

07:07.799 --> 07:09.998
You better come in, Rae.

07:09.999 --> 07:13.999
Thanks.

07:17.999 --> 07:19.758
Where's Mrs Gemmel?

07:19.759 --> 07:22.518
She's still down at the hospital.

07:22.519 --> 07:25.038
There's nothing anyone can do.

07:25.039 --> 07:28.718
Well, I think you're wrong,
Mr Gemmel.

07:28.719 --> 07:32.719
I think that there are things we
could do, I could do, to help Chloe.

07:33.839 --> 07:34.998
Like what?

07:34.999 --> 07:37.958
Well, for a start,
there's her clothes.

07:37.959 --> 07:40.238
See, I know what clothes Chloe likes,

07:40.239 --> 07:44.038
so I could just take them to her.
No, wait.

07:44.039 --> 07:47.198
Grapes, that's what you
take, isn't it? Grapes.

07:47.199 --> 07:48.998
Does Chloe even like grapes?

07:48.999 --> 07:52.718
No! She likes raisins and sultanas,
I think.

07:52.719 --> 07:54.798
But I... I don't know the difference.

07:54.799 --> 07:57.398
'What was I on about?'

07:57.399 --> 07:59.918
She likes the ones
in the little red box,

07:59.919 --> 08:01.598
so I'll just pick some of them up.

08:01.599 --> 08:04.158
'Stop talking about dried fruit!'

08:04.159 --> 08:06.118
But the main thing is...

08:06.119 --> 08:08.038
Mr Gemmel...

08:08.039 --> 08:10.078
You'll like this.

08:10.079 --> 08:12.398
..textbooks.

08:12.399 --> 08:15.238
I could just go up to Chloe's room
and get some textbooks

08:15.239 --> 08:17.358
and then I could read them to her.

08:17.359 --> 08:20.478
Over and over, because some of it
might sink in before, you know,

08:20.479 --> 08:22.318
her last exam and she wakes up.

08:22.319 --> 08:25.358
She's asleep, Rae. No, I know,
but some of it might sink in.

08:25.359 --> 08:28.078
No, she won't hear you.
She's unconscious.

08:28.079 --> 08:30.318
No, but that's what people do,
isn't it?

08:30.319 --> 08:34.318
They... they read and talk
to plants and vegetables

08:34.839 --> 08:37.638
and that's what makes them grow.

08:37.639 --> 08:40.837
'Vegetables? Classic.'

08:40.839 --> 08:43.198
Look, wh...

08:43.198 --> 08:44.958
I appreciate what
you're trying to do,

08:44.959 --> 08:47.358
but I really don't think
it'll do very much for Chloe.

08:47.359 --> 08:50.238
Besides, you've got your A-levels
to be thinking about, so...

08:50.239 --> 08:52.638
It's not important. I don't care.

08:52.639 --> 08:55.118
All the same, my wife and...

08:55.119 --> 08:56.518
we're both...

08:56.519 --> 08:59.358
very clear on this, that...

08:59.359 --> 09:00.558
Clear on what?

09:00.559 --> 09:02.118
That you've...

09:02.119 --> 09:06.119
you've probably done enough.

09:06.759 --> 09:08.518
It might be best if you...

09:08.519 --> 09:10.270
if you just kept away.

09:24.239 --> 09:27.598
'Dear diary, when life is shit,
turn to music.

09:27.599 --> 09:30.279
'When life is
scrape-it-off-the-walls shit,

09:30.279 --> 09:33.238

Karim. Rae...

10:03.199 --> 10:06.558
Tomorrow is your mother's birthday.

10:06.559 --> 10:08.158
She think I forget.

10:08.159 --> 10:09.518
I not forget.

10:09.519 --> 10:10.878
Well done.

10:10.879 --> 10:13.598
I will make for her a nice time

10:13.599 --> 10:15.358
in this house tomorrow.

10:15.359 --> 10:18.758
And you, you will make a big cake.
Yes?

10:18.759 --> 10:21.718
Erm... well, I can buy a big cake.

10:21.719 --> 10:23.318
For tomorrow? Yeah.

10:23.319 --> 10:25.118
After college, you go.

10:25.119 --> 10:27.118
Yep, I will get a cake.

10:27.119 --> 10:28.798
A big cake.

10:28.799 --> 10:31.918
A big cake.

10:31.919 --> 10:35.919
Right now I'm kind of
in the middle of something.

10:35.959 --> 10:37.958
Study?

10:37.959 --> 10:41.959
Yeah, something like that.

10:57.199 --> 10:59.918
'It was time to pull out
the big guns.

10:59.919 --> 11:02.318

Yeah, I'm looking for...

11:31.799 --> 11:33.478
'What the fuck?'

11:33.479 --> 11:34.878
There may be some...

11:34.879 --> 11:36.399
'It was like seeing a ghost.

'A ghost who couldn't be bothered

11:56.239 --> 11:59.159
What's she supposed to play it on?

12:02.399 --> 12:04.638
I can't see how
that's going to work.

12:04.639 --> 12:07.318
Well, you just lay the headphones
on the pillow.

12:07.319 --> 12:10.358
Then the music just drifts up.

12:10.359 --> 12:12.678
I just want to help.

12:12.679 --> 12:15.358
Exams start tomorrow, don't they?

12:15.359 --> 12:18.038
Exams aren't important,
Mrs Gemmell, not any more.

12:18.039 --> 12:20.358
They might not be important to you,

12:20.359 --> 12:23.278
but they were
very important to Chloe.

12:23.279 --> 12:24.318
I know.

12:24.319 --> 12:26.118
She'd been revising. I know.

12:26.119 --> 12:28.798
And she wanted to revise
the night you came round.

12:28.799 --> 12:32.799
I know.

12:32.839 --> 12:34.718
But she's been very lucky.

12:34.719 --> 12:36.638
She regained consciousness
an hour ago

12:36.639 --> 12:39.718
and now she's sleeping.

12:39.719 --> 12:43.558
Well, can I see her?

12:43.559 --> 12:46.918
When Chloe wakes up, she's going
to find out that her exams,

12:46.919 --> 12:49.678
business school,
the things she's been planning

12:49.679 --> 12:52.438
have been thrown upside down.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.758
If the other car...

12:53.759 --> 12:57.518
had been six inches further over,
six inches...

12:57.519 --> 12:59.198
that would've been it.

12:59.199 --> 13:02.598
It would've been fatal!

13:02.599 --> 13:04.598
A cassette tape isn't going
to give her back

13:04.599 --> 13:08.599
the future she deserves.

13:39.159 --> 13:42.719
Rae? Where've you been?

13:42.719 --> 13:45.238
What? Where've you been?

13:45.239 --> 13:46.318
I was at the hospital.

13:46.319 --> 13:49.038
I've been trying to ring you.

13:49.039 --> 13:51.398
Sorry.

13:51.399 --> 13:53.078
Rae, why are you ignoring me?

13:53.079 --> 13:55.158
Rae, have you heard yet?
It's great, innit?

13:55.159 --> 13:58.118
It's better than that.
It's fucking fantastic. Rae.

13:58.119 --> 14:00.398
Just heard. It's amazing.

14:00.399 --> 14:03.038
Erm, this is Katie.

14:03.039 --> 14:05.758
Really happy for you all.

14:05.759 --> 14:08.598
So, are we going to get
to see her or what? Yeah.

14:08.599 --> 14:11.358
Her mum said we could go
and visit her tomorrow.

14:11.359 --> 14:12.518
'So it was just me that

14:12.519 --> 14:14.118
'wasn't allowed
to see her.'

14:14.119 --> 14:15.318
This time, I'm driving.

14:15.319 --> 14:17.719
Yeah, last time we let Rae
organise a lock-in!

14:20.039 --> 14:21.638
Now, the diet coke's on the house,

14:21.639 --> 14:23.038
but the sherry needs covering.

14:23.039 --> 14:25.638
I've had a ticking off from
Derek at the distillery.

14:25.639 --> 14:27.358
Rae.

14:27.359 --> 14:31.118
Rae, are you all right?

14:31.119 --> 14:32.838
Rae, what are you doing?

14:32.839 --> 14:34.318
Where are you going?

14:34.319 --> 14:35.758
Rae?

14:35.759 --> 14:38.158
Why am I even anywhere near a pub?

14:38.159 --> 14:41.158
What's there to be happy about?
I nearly killed her.

14:41.159 --> 14:42.718
You didn't!

14:42.719 --> 14:45.718
Rae, please!

14:45.719 --> 14:49.719
I'm here, Rae, can you not see me?

14:52.199 --> 14:53.278
Look, let's...

14:53.279 --> 14:56.798
Let's spend some time together.
Come over to mine and...

14:56.799 --> 15:00.799
you can help me shift that stupid
sofa bed up the stairs if you want.

15:03.239 --> 15:07.239
I love you.

15:07.959 --> 15:11.959
I want you back.

15:12.119 --> 15:13.278
I don't deserve it.

15:13.279 --> 15:15.718
That's bollocks. You know it is.
Is it?

15:15.719 --> 15:16.918
It is.

15:16.919 --> 15:20.919
What's happening to you?
You're acting mental.

15:21.039 --> 15:25.039
You sound so surprised.

15:48.999 --> 15:52.078
I'm waiting on Kester.

15:52.079 --> 15:53.918
Dr Gill went home.

15:53.919 --> 15:57.558
I'm sorry.

15:57.559 --> 16:01.559
It's Rachel, isn't it?

16:01.639 --> 16:04.438
If you like, Rachel,
you can talk to me.

16:04.439 --> 16:06.518
I'll be free in 20 minutes.

16:06.519 --> 16:09.518
I don't know you.

16:09.519 --> 16:11.118
I'm Dr Allen.

16:11.119 --> 16:13.998
Dr Gill and I trained together
in Roehampton.

16:13.999 --> 16:17.158
It's no trouble.

16:17.159 --> 16:18.958
Rachel, it's OK.

16:18.959 --> 16:21.358
Lots of people have
more than one therapist.

16:21.359 --> 16:24.398
I don't want
more than one therapist.

16:24.399 --> 16:25.838
It can be helpful.

16:25.839 --> 16:29.839
Well, do I look like
I'm finding it helpful?

16:39.599 --> 16:42.438
'All I wanted to do
was help Chloe.

16:42.439 --> 16:44.358
'but maybe the Gemmells were right.

16:44.359 --> 16:48.359
'Maybe I should do everyone a favour
and just stay away.'

16:51.039 --> 16:54.158
Rachel?

16:54.159 --> 16:58.159
I'm sorry, I had no idea.
Do you work here?

16:58.199 --> 17:00.358
Look, I'm sorry.

17:00.359 --> 17:03.638
I mean, I came in
to get a CD before, erm...

17:03.639 --> 17:05.917
but I had to go and... go
and get some money!

17:05.919 --> 17:09.919
Er, which CD?

17:09.999 --> 17:13.999
It was Elton John.

17:16.079 --> 17:18.877
It's £9.99.

17:18.878 --> 17:22.878
Um...

17:23.959 --> 17:26.118
'I don't know why I said
what I said next.

17:26.119 --> 17:28.239
'It wasn't because he was my dad.

17:28.239 --> 17:31.758
'Maybe it was because he was
the only person left to talk to.

17:31.759 --> 17:35.759
'Or maybe it was just because
he looked as shit I felt.'

17:40.439 --> 17:44.439
Just putting the kettle on.

17:49.399 --> 17:53.399
I am in what's known
as a studio flat.

17:53.799 --> 17:57.799
You should come over
and visit sometime, maybe?

17:57.879 --> 18:00.718
I've got a lot on. Exams and...

18:00.719 --> 18:02.718
GCSEs?

18:02.719 --> 18:06.719
A-Levels.

18:08.239 --> 18:11.518
So, you're not living with
that woman any more, then?

18:11.519 --> 18:15.118
No, no. That's all over!

18:15.119 --> 18:16.438
A strange woman.

18:16.439 --> 18:19.438
She refused point blank
to have a sense of humour.

18:19.439 --> 18:22.118
I mean, that is one thing
that I will say about your mum,

18:22.119 --> 18:25.278
we did have a great laugh.

18:25.279 --> 18:28.078
She mentioned you yesterday.

18:28.079 --> 18:29.478
Did she?

18:29.479 --> 18:30.878
Yeah.

18:30.879 --> 18:34.038
She said you used to sing to her
on her birthday.

18:34.039 --> 18:35.838
Really? Why?

18:35.839 --> 18:39.839
Yeah, well, it's not like she talks about
you on a regular basis or anything.

18:42.319 --> 18:46.319
I don't think I treated your mum
very well, Rachel.

18:47.119 --> 18:51.119
And I regret it.

18:51.519 --> 18:53.198
Maybe you should tell her.

18:53.199 --> 18:55.639
I don't think that would
go down very well!

18:57.079 --> 19:00.958
You don't realise what it's like
to have the chance to say sorry

19:00.959 --> 19:04.038
for something bad that you've done!

19:04.039 --> 19:05.518
Rae,

19:05.519 --> 19:07.278
I don't think she'd thank me for it.

19:07.279 --> 19:09.198
Yeah, well,
it's the right thing to do, so...

19:09.199 --> 19:11.478
Rae, oh, please don't.

19:11.479 --> 19:12.878
Please. No.

19:12.879 --> 19:14.758
It's fine.

19:14.759 --> 19:18.759
No.

19:19.639 --> 19:20.958
Sorry.

19:20.959 --> 19:24.159
Look, I don't know what to do.

19:25.559 --> 19:29.559
Will you answer me a question?

19:31.519 --> 19:35.078
Do you think the fact that
I let people down the whole time

19:35.079 --> 19:38.278
and the fact that
I always fuck things up,

19:38.279 --> 19:42.279
do you think that's something
that I get from you?

19:45.119 --> 19:47.198
Put it this way,

19:47.199 --> 19:51.199
I don't think you get it
from your mother.

19:53.159 --> 19:56.878
Thank you.

19:56.879 --> 20:00.478
And I still fuck up.

20:00.479 --> 20:01.758
I think that's what happens.

20:01.759 --> 20:03.838
You know, the longer you leave
your mistakes,

20:03.839 --> 20:07.238
the harder it is to put them right.

20:07.239 --> 20:11.239
You only get one chance
to fix your fuck-ups, Rae.

20:18.719 --> 20:20.958
Don't worry.

20:20.959 --> 20:24.959
I'll stay out of your record shop.

20:27.079 --> 20:31.079
But I will think about
what you said about your mum.

20:40.559 --> 20:42.838
'I thought about what my dad said.

20:42.839 --> 20:45.598
'You only get one chance
to fix things.

20:45.599 --> 20:48.358
'I had one night left
to revise for Sociology

20:48.359 --> 20:52.359
'and I knew what I had to do.'

21:24.439 --> 21:27.718
Sociology Paper One
is two hours long.

21:27.719 --> 21:30.998
The time now is 11:45,
so you have until 1:45.

21:30.999 --> 21:34.999
You may turn over your papers.

21:51.119 --> 21:54.598
'I had decided
I should take my A-Levels.

21:54.599 --> 21:56.408
'I should take them for Chloe.'

22:11.213 --> 22:14.732
How was it? Do you know what,
Chop? Not too bad.

22:14.733 --> 22:16.852
How come you left the
pub like that, then?

22:16.853 --> 22:19.293
Should I be worried
about you, Raemundo?

22:19.293 --> 22:23.212
Not any more. Thanks, though.

22:23.213 --> 22:25.133
Look! Here she is.

22:25.133 --> 22:28.773
Stamford's own Cindy Crawford.
How was it? It was all right.

22:28.774 --> 22:31.972
What questions did you do?
The one about population.

22:31.973 --> 22:35.213
What about the other two?

22:35.213 --> 22:38.292
You were meant to do
three questions.

22:38.293 --> 22:40.932
One question, Izzy.

22:40.933 --> 22:42.652
Well, I did three.

22:42.653 --> 22:44.612
And Tracey Munro did three.

22:44.613 --> 22:48.613
And everyone else I was talking to
in the canteen just now did three.

22:48.973 --> 22:51.693
Did you only do one question, Rae?

22:53.293 --> 22:56.012
No!

22:56.013 --> 23:00.013
All right, see you. See you!

23:03.693 --> 23:06.412
How'd it go?

23:06.413 --> 23:09.892
Yeah, it was all right.
Yeah? Do you want a lift?

23:09.893 --> 23:12.612
'It was weird how Katie
kept turning up,

23:12.613 --> 23:16.252
'but I needed to get away from
the scene of the crime.'

23:16.253 --> 23:19.852
Yeah.

23:19.853 --> 23:22.572
So were you just driving
past, then, or...?

23:22.573 --> 23:24.492
Came to get you, didn't I?

23:24.493 --> 23:28.052
We were worried about you
yesterday in the pub.

23:28.053 --> 23:30.812
We? Me and Finn.

23:30.813 --> 23:33.892
When we saw you leaving.

23:33.893 --> 23:37.893
So I just wanted to check
to see if you were OK.

23:38.453 --> 23:40.412
I hope you don't mind.

23:40.413 --> 23:43.972
No. No, it's fine.

23:43.973 --> 23:46.052
He's a big softie, isn't he?

23:46.053 --> 23:48.412
I had no idea he was so sensitive.

23:48.413 --> 23:52.413
Well, don't you remember him
from college?

23:53.093 --> 23:56.492
Never talked to me at college.

23:56.493 --> 24:00.493
No-one did. At least not to my face.

24:02.693 --> 24:05.252
Can you just slow down
a bit, please?

24:05.253 --> 24:09.253
I'm only doing 30, Rae.

24:12.333 --> 24:15.772
Come on, so what questions
did you do in the exam?

24:15.773 --> 24:18.332
Just pull over.
You don't have to drive!

24:18.333 --> 24:20.692
Rae, chill out.
Will you just pull over?

24:20.693 --> 24:23.492
Please, I promise it'll all be OK!
Rae, we're not even there yet.

24:23.493 --> 24:26.093
Just pull the fuck over! Now!

24:28.213 --> 24:32.213
Sorry, I'm not used to these brakes.

24:34.773 --> 24:37.452
Listen, Rae, tell me to
mind my own business

24:37.453 --> 24:39.692
with Finn and stuff,

24:39.693 --> 24:43.693
but I just thought you'd want
to know. No, it's fine.

24:46.533 --> 24:47.612
Er...

24:47.613 --> 24:49.813
it's open, Einstein.

24:53.693 --> 24:57.693
See you. See you.

24:58.533 --> 25:02.533
'Even Katie couldn't help me
un-fuck-up two sets of A-levels.'

25:05.893 --> 25:08.412
'I just needed some space
away from everyone

25:08.413 --> 25:12.413
'to figure out how I was going
to sort everything out.'

25:17.213 --> 25:19.012
SURPRI... Oh.

25:19.013 --> 25:20.852
Bollocks.

25:20.853 --> 25:24.812
'There were two options. Either I'd
totally forgotten the big 4-5,

25:24.813 --> 25:27.212
'or Michael Aspel was
about to appear and say,

25:27.213 --> 25:31.092
"Tonight, Rachel Earl, this is your
pathetic excuse for a life."'

25:31.093 --> 25:33.053
SURPRISE!

25:38.973 --> 25:41.932
June!

25:41.933 --> 25:45.933
Hello!

25:48.293 --> 25:51.812
OK, everybody. Speech! Speech!

25:51.813 --> 25:53.252
OK, erm...

25:53.253 --> 25:57.253
When a 43-year-old woman goes
to Peterborough leisure centre

25:57.573 --> 26:00.052
for her weekly aqua aerobic class,

26:00.053 --> 26:04.053
she doesn't expect to meet a man
who'll turn her life upside down.

26:04.653 --> 26:08.132
And he slotted into our life
right away, didn't he, Rae?

26:08.133 --> 26:10.092
His name was Karim.

26:10.093 --> 26:12.132
Still is.

26:12.133 --> 26:14.052
And he's lovely.

26:14.053 --> 26:16.972
Because he does things like this.

26:16.973 --> 26:20.412
And without him I wouldn't
be having a happy birthday.

26:20.413 --> 26:21.652
Aww.

26:21.653 --> 26:24.172
Would just be having a birthday.

26:24.173 --> 26:26.772
At least there were still
some places on this Earth

26:26.773 --> 26:29.132
where good people could
have a nice time,

26:29.133 --> 26:32.412
safe from the chaotic influence
of Rachel Earl.

26:32.413 --> 26:35.972
I put baby to nap, then party!

26:35.973 --> 26:38.253
Perfect!

26:51.333 --> 26:53.573
'Holy cock and balls!'

26:56.853 --> 27:00.853
I'll get it! I'll go!

27:03.373 --> 27:07.373
Hello, Linda. What the...

27:12.813 --> 27:15.332
Get him out of here now!

27:15.333 --> 27:19.333
He wasn't... Now! I'm telling you!

27:22.093 --> 27:24.692
Right, you can't be here.
You've got to go.

27:24.693 --> 27:27.532
I just came to say happy birthday.
No, you can't.

27:27.533 --> 27:29.692
You come in here, you...

27:29.693 --> 27:33.532
OK, just sit there.

27:33.533 --> 27:37.533
No, you've had enough!

27:40.973 --> 27:44.252
OK, so he's going to stay... No, no,
look at him, Rae!

27:44.253 --> 27:47.492
Look! This isn't just my day.

27:47.493 --> 27:51.493
And look at all the work he's done!
I know, I'm... Shut up! Mum...

28:08.013 --> 28:12.013
# What have I got to do
to make you love me?

28:15.253 --> 28:19.253
# What do I have to do
to make you care?

28:22.773 --> 28:26.773
# What do I do when
lightning strikes me?

28:30.613 --> 28:34.613
# And I wake up and
you're not there?

28:38.093 --> 28:41.252
# So sad, so sad

28:41.253 --> 28:44.973
# It's a sad, sad situation

28:44.973 --> 28:48.973
# And it's getting more
and more absurd. #

28:52.373 --> 28:56.373
Go.

28:56.773 --> 28:59.092
No.

28:59.093 --> 29:01.052
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

29:01.053 --> 29:03.452
All right, all right! Don't fight!

29:03.453 --> 29:06.412
I'm going, you don't need to fight.
Please...

29:06.413 --> 29:10.413
No, don't go! At least
have some cake!

29:10.813 --> 29:14.813
Have we got any cake?

29:24.373 --> 29:27.372
Since when is it OK to do that

29:27.373 --> 29:30.012
to this family in this house?

29:30.013 --> 29:34.013
Well, he's my family.
He's not your fucking family.

29:34.093 --> 29:36.092
He had his chance.

29:36.093 --> 29:38.692
You knew it was my birthday, Rae.

29:38.693 --> 29:40.492
I forgot.

29:40.493 --> 29:42.332
Cos that's what I'm like.

29:42.333 --> 29:46.333
It's how I've always been.
I get it from him.

29:47.333 --> 29:51.333
Everything I touch turns
to shit, Mum.

29:51.693 --> 29:55.693
And when I try to say sorry,
no-one lets me.

29:56.973 --> 29:59.972
When I try and put it right,
I only make it worse.

29:59.973 --> 30:03.532
The fuck-ups, oh, they just
keep coming. But this, Rae.

30:03.533 --> 30:05.892
This today.

30:05.893 --> 30:08.092
This was a mistake,

30:08.093 --> 30:11.932
but if you're talking about
what happened to Chloe -

30:11.933 --> 30:15.933
if you're blaming yourself
for that, then don't.

30:16.933 --> 30:20.772
That's not your fault.

30:20.773 --> 30:24.773
You don't get anything from him.

30:27.813 --> 30:30.452
So.

30:30.453 --> 30:33.532
What are you going to do now?

30:33.533 --> 30:37.533
I want to see Kester.

30:54.813 --> 30:57.812
I like parking here.

30:57.813 --> 31:00.012
This is the ugliest
building in Stamford,

31:00.013 --> 31:04.013
so when you're in here,
you can't see it.

31:06.093 --> 31:10.093
My shifts have changed, so I don't
work weekends any more.

31:10.133 --> 31:14.133
They should've sent you a letter
about it. I'm sorry they didn't.

31:16.773 --> 31:20.773
The accident was my fault.

31:23.893 --> 31:26.332
If you think it was your fault,

31:26.333 --> 31:30.333
why are you calling it an accident?

31:40.693 --> 31:43.252
Did I ever tell you
that when I was 17,

31:43.253 --> 31:45.772
when all this was black and white,

31:45.773 --> 31:49.773
I got asked to train - to try out
for Wrexham Football Club.

31:51.293 --> 31:53.492
My team.

31:53.493 --> 31:55.652
Did I ever tell you that?

31:55.653 --> 31:59.132
Thought you weren't allowed to
tell me anything from your life.

31:59.133 --> 32:02.652
And even though I knew deep down
inside that I wasn't good enough -

32:02.653 --> 32:05.812
I mean, I wasn't even the best
footballer in my school -

32:05.813 --> 32:08.292
I still went.

32:08.293 --> 32:10.572
I stood there in line
with all the other lads,

32:10.573 --> 32:14.092
in our tracksuits and our hair.

32:14.093 --> 32:16.212
Three days running around
in the pissing rain

32:16.213 --> 32:18.132
and I barely got
a touch of the ball.

32:18.133 --> 32:21.212
Complete and utter disaster.

32:21.213 --> 32:25.213
Well, it's not the best
story I've ever heard.

32:26.093 --> 32:29.372
But if I'd never have gone,

32:29.373 --> 32:31.892
then I'd never have known.

32:31.893 --> 32:35.572
And that would have been torture.

32:35.573 --> 32:38.292
Just because I didn't
deserve a place

32:38.293 --> 32:42.132
didn't mean I didn't
deserve a chance.

32:42.133 --> 32:45.252
Someone saw something in me.

32:45.253 --> 32:48.012
Just like someone,
some stuffy professor,

32:48.013 --> 32:52.013
saw something in you.

32:52.093 --> 32:56.093
But this is where we differ,
you see, you and me.

32:56.893 --> 33:00.893
Because you are good enough,
and you can do it.

33:01.493 --> 33:05.052
But you have to take your chance.

33:05.053 --> 33:09.053
You owe yourself that.

33:13.173 --> 33:16.132
Two more sessions.

33:16.133 --> 33:18.892
That wasn't a session,
that was a story.

33:18.893 --> 33:20.532
It was a story-session.

33:20.533 --> 33:24.533
I can't think about Bristol,
Kester. I need to see Chloe.

33:25.973 --> 33:29.973
I need to say sorry, but her
family won't let me. Come on.

33:30.493 --> 33:32.172
Come on.

33:32.173 --> 33:35.413
Since when have you let other people
stop you doing what you want?

34:00.533 --> 34:02.293
You OK, babe?

34:12.453 --> 34:14.891
They say I'll be out by the end
of the week.

34:14.893 --> 34:18.893
Well, they must know about
the leavers' ball.

34:26.092 --> 34:30.092
I've messed everything up, Chlo.

34:30.652 --> 34:33.972
It's like the crash was just
the start of it.

34:33.973 --> 34:37.612
Well, you know why we crashed,
don't you?

34:37.612 --> 34:41.612
Cos I made you drive.

34:43.493 --> 34:47.493
It's because you saw my hand.

34:51.493 --> 34:55.493
It's cos we're friends.

34:57.013 --> 35:01.013
That's what did it.

35:01.973 --> 35:04.372
If I hadn't have kept looking down,

35:04.373 --> 35:08.373
if I hadn't have been worried
about seeing this...

35:10.333 --> 35:14.333
..then I'd have been looking where
I was going, wouldn't I?

35:15.253 --> 35:19.253
And I'd have seen that car.

35:22.293 --> 35:26.293
I got your back, babe.

35:31.093 --> 35:35.093
Have you been giving yourself
a hard time?

35:35.213 --> 35:37.692
It's OK.

35:37.693 --> 35:41.412
Katie said it's all right to feel
shit about yourself.

35:41.413 --> 35:45.413
Not sure how I feel about that
Katie Springer.

35:45.453 --> 35:46.972
She's wrong.

35:46.973 --> 35:50.973
Anyway, I think you've got no reason
to feel shit

35:52.333 --> 35:55.892
so just carry on with
what you're doing.

35:55.893 --> 35:58.812
Doing what, Chlo?

35:58.813 --> 36:02.813
I'm not going to take my exams
if you can't.

36:03.093 --> 36:06.332
I'm not going through all of this

36:06.333 --> 36:10.333
for us to both miss out on our exams.

36:10.653 --> 36:14.252
You're the only one who can do them
anyway.

36:14.253 --> 36:15.532
Well, that's not true.

36:15.533 --> 36:17.812
I was joking... Oh.

36:17.813 --> 36:21.813
..kind of.

36:22.933 --> 36:26.933
Promise me. You'll be brilliant
at them.

36:32.893 --> 36:36.492
Rachel.

36:36.493 --> 36:37.852
I don't want to make a scene.

36:37.853 --> 36:41.853
Then don't.

36:50.373 --> 36:51.772
I should go anyway.

36:51.773 --> 36:54.052
Will you please do me a favour?

36:54.053 --> 36:56.372
Erm...

36:56.373 --> 36:57.412
OK.

36:57.413 --> 37:01.413
Will you bring me some chocolate?

37:09.933 --> 37:13.933
I've got your back.

37:19.293 --> 37:22.732
Promise me you won't
hurt yourself again.

37:22.733 --> 37:26.733
I promise.

37:31.093 --> 37:33.292
'Chloe had been the
one in the car crash,

37:33.293 --> 37:36.853
'but it was me she
pulled from the wreckage.

37:36.853 --> 37:40.853
'She made it OK to think
about the future again.

37:44.453 --> 37:47.852
'I decided to own up
about Chloe's exam paper,

37:47.853 --> 37:51.692
'but I had no idea just how
pissed off mum would actually be

37:51.693 --> 37:54.333
'when I told her.'

37:54.333 --> 37:58.333
Don't start.
Don't you start with "Don't start"!

38:05.758 --> 38:09.758
How was it ever going to work, Rae?

38:10.158 --> 38:11.678
It wasn't.

38:12.838 --> 38:16.838
I'll have to inform the exam board.
I've got no alternative.

38:17.078 --> 38:20.998
They'll probably stop you from
taking any more of their papers.

38:20.999 --> 38:23.798
But can I take other papers
from other boards?

38:23.798 --> 38:27.798
Not at this college, no.

38:28.358 --> 38:31.917
It's not Rae's fault.

38:31.918 --> 38:35.437
Things have been
difficult at home recently.

38:35.438 --> 38:39.438
My ex-husband's been around, causing
trouble, and my current husband,

38:39.558 --> 38:43.558
who's a lollipop man, has been told
he's going to be losing his job.

38:44.718 --> 38:47.917
The council want to replace him
with a pelican crossing.

38:47.918 --> 38:51.917
So, what with the crash and all the
pressure I've been putting on her

38:51.918 --> 38:54.237
to do her revision,
things have been sort of...

38:54.238 --> 38:58.238
Hell at home for Rae,
these last few days.

38:58.958 --> 39:02.958
She would be the first person ever
in our family to go to university.

39:05.118 --> 39:07.037
Ever.

39:07.038 --> 39:09.557
She deserves that.

39:09.558 --> 39:11.398
You know she does.

39:16.358 --> 39:19.277
Er, there is a thing called
special circumstances.

39:19.278 --> 39:21.557
If I can talk to your
therapist today,

39:21.558 --> 39:24.998
then perhaps we can make
a case for a retake,

39:24.998 --> 39:28.278
but you'll have to take it now,
before your English paper.

39:28.279 --> 39:30.677
There's a 24-hour rule.

39:30.678 --> 39:33.437
'And there it was. The Great Escape.

39:33.438 --> 39:35.437
'Steve McQueen had his motorbike,

39:35.438 --> 39:39.438
'Rachel Earl had a middle-aged
white woman in a hijab.'

39:44.398 --> 39:48.398
You were incredible.
No, you were stupid. Stupid.

39:48.478 --> 39:50.637
Don't you let yourself down,
do you understand?

39:50.638 --> 39:54.638
There's people counting on you.

40:00.118 --> 40:04.118
Sociology Paper One is two hours
long, giving you until noon.

40:05.758 --> 40:09.557
You may turn your paper over.

40:09.558 --> 40:13.558
'Dear Diary, there is something
about taking an exam that feels

40:13.918 --> 40:16.717
'less pressured than normal life.

40:16.718 --> 40:19.677
'I think it's because no-one who
reads this paper will ever

40:19.678 --> 40:23.477
'know who I am,
or what I've been through.

40:23.478 --> 40:27.478
'All they will know is my name.

40:28.318 --> 40:29.997
'Every word I wrote on the page

40:29.998 --> 40:33.397
'was like taking a step
back from the edge.

40:33.398 --> 40:36.517
'My future is mine for the taking.

40:36.518 --> 40:40.518
'My future belongs to me.'

40:44.958 --> 40:46.598
Rae. I just want to talk...

40:46.599 --> 40:48.237
What... if you'll let me.

40:48.238 --> 40:50.237
What... What do you mean?

40:50.238 --> 40:52.957
Finn, I'm sorry I pushed you away.

40:52.958 --> 40:54.157
Right, OK...

40:54.158 --> 40:57.557
See, I'm getting better,
I promise. I'm sorting my head out.

40:57.558 --> 41:00.917
I know, I know...
Look, Finn, I don't care

41:00.918 --> 41:04.918
if we are together long-term
or short-term or officially.

41:06.478 --> 41:07.837
Rae, I think we should just...

41:07.838 --> 41:11.197
I don't care, because I need you,
Finn Nelson. And you need me.

41:11.198 --> 41:13.877
We need to sit down and talk,
all right? Talk about what?

41:13.878 --> 41:15.757
About you changing your
mind about things.

41:15.758 --> 41:19.517
Yeah, I know, but I'm not
going to do that any more.

41:19.518 --> 41:23.518
I'm not, I promise! Let's just say
that I'm your new flatmate.

41:24.558 --> 41:27.197
Cos you know what happens
when you have a boy flatmate

41:27.198 --> 41:29.517
and a girl flatmate,
don't you? Yeah...

41:29.518 --> 41:32.957
You get a flatmates with
benefits scenario. Yeah. Yeah?

41:32.958 --> 41:35.077
I know, I know, just hold
on a second. OK? Come on.

41:35.078 --> 41:36.877
No, no, Rae, please...
Finn, move out...

41:36.878 --> 41:40.077
Please, please, no, no.
Why are you being weird? No, stay...

41:40.078 --> 41:42.558
Rae.

41:48.998 --> 41:50.758
Where you going? Move, Finn.

41:50.758 --> 41:54.758
No, Rae, please. Please don't.

41:55.118 --> 41:56.757
What?!

41:56.758 --> 42:00.758
What, Finn?!

42:15.838 --> 42:17.317
Can I help you, love?

42:17.318 --> 42:20.437
Erm, yeah, erm...

42:20.438 --> 42:22.717
Erm...

42:22.718 --> 42:25.917
I-I-I want to see Kester.

42:25.918 --> 42:28.157
Kester? Kester Gill, yeah.

42:28.158 --> 42:30.357
Kester Gill doesn't
work here any more.

42:30.358 --> 42:33.677
He hasn't worked here since April.

42:33.678 --> 42:35.557
What?

42:35.558 --> 42:37.277
No.

42:37.278 --> 42:41.157
Can you check again? No, I don't
need to check. He doesn't work here.

42:41.158 --> 42:45.117
Can you check again, please?
He hasn't worked here since April.

42:45.118 --> 42:48.838
Right, I'll just go and get him,
then. No, no, you won't. Come on.

42:48.838 --> 42:51.318
Kester? No, no, he's not
down there, so don't...

42:51.319 --> 42:52.597
Kester?!

42:52.598 --> 42:54.357
That's enough now.
You need to go now.

42:54.358 --> 42:56.197
Why are you doing this?

42:56.198 --> 42:58.117
I'm not doing anything. Now come on.

42:58.118 --> 43:01.878
You're just a liar!

43:45.278 --> 43:47.517
You don't want to be doing that.

43:47.518 --> 43:51.518
Come on, come on. Come with me.

43:51.798 --> 43:55.278
Come on, you're all right.

44:01.678 --> 44:03.917
English Literature Paper B
is three hours long.

44:03.918 --> 44:05.798
The time now is
precisely two o'clock,

44:05.798 --> 44:09.798
meaning, for those of you who don't
do maths, you have until five.

44:09.878 --> 44:11.972
You may turn your papers over.
