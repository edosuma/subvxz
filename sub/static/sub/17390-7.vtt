WEBVTT

00:03.617 --> 00:04.883
Okay, here's the deal...

00:04.885 --> 00:06.651
if we plug these in and they light up,

00:06.653 --> 00:08.371
we got to spend the
afternoon untangling them.

00:08.396 --> 00:11.163
If they don't, we can chuck
'em and watch the game.

00:11.424 --> 00:13.458
Yeah. I know what I'm rooting for.

00:13.460 --> 00:15.293
Yeah.

00:16.429 --> 00:18.029
- Aw...
- Aw...

00:19.299 --> 00:21.065
- Hey...!
- Hey...!

00:21.067 --> 00:22.104
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

00:22.129 --> 00:24.002
- Aw...
- Aw...

00:27.875 --> 00:29.607
- Hey...!
- Hey...!

00:31.156 --> 00:33.256
I think we celebrate that
with a Christmas beer.

00:33.281 --> 00:35.958
Hey, remember when we used to help
Dad untangle the Christmas lights?

00:35.983 --> 00:38.183
Yeah. That's where I
learned all my swear words.

00:38.358 --> 00:40.992
He'd start with a couple a couple
frickin' frackin's, and then he'd

00:40.994 --> 00:42.360
move on to the good stuff.

00:42.362 --> 00:43.595
Hey.

00:43.597 --> 00:45.396
Hey, honey.

00:45.398 --> 00:47.732
Oh, look at the lights.

00:47.734 --> 00:49.901
It's exciting!

00:49.903 --> 00:53.505
It's the time to deck the
halls and jingle some bells.

00:53.507 --> 00:55.540
- Don, you remember Christmas Andi.
- Yeah.

00:55.542 --> 00:57.442
She's just like regular
Andi, except if someone

00:57.444 --> 00:58.943
popped off her head and stuffed her

00:58.945 --> 01:01.212
full of snowflakes and speed.

01:01.214 --> 01:03.615
I can't help it... it's
my favorite time of year.

01:03.617 --> 01:06.251
Oh, which reminds me. For our
Christmas pictures this year,

01:06.253 --> 01:07.896
we're all gonna wear matching sweaters

01:07.921 --> 01:09.988
for maximum cuteness.

01:09.990 --> 01:12.590
I smell a trip to Sweater Barn.

01:12.592 --> 01:14.359
Oh, Sweater Barn!

01:14.361 --> 01:16.461
Great idea, Don. Thanks!

01:17.223 --> 01:20.057
Yeah, thanks, Don.

01:20.059 --> 01:22.312
- Well, at least it's not Candle House.
- Oh!

01:22.337 --> 01:24.938
Candle House! Thank
you for reminding me.

01:25.965 --> 01:27.932
- You did that one to yourself.
- Yeah.

01:27.934 --> 01:29.033
Okay, honey,

01:29.035 --> 01:30.868
you know I love Christmas Andi, okay,

01:30.870 --> 01:33.096
but I don't want you making
yourself crazy, all right?

01:33.121 --> 01:34.633
Christmas is still three weeks away,

01:34.658 --> 01:36.050
and you're already at level eight.

01:37.094 --> 01:39.610
That's okay, I can go
all the way to a hundred.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.256
Okay. Well, I'm off to the craft store.

01:42.281 --> 01:45.583
I can't believe I let our
glitter supply get this low.

01:45.585 --> 01:48.486
Look, hey, hey, hey, before you
go, just think about this, okay?

01:48.488 --> 01:50.934
You're back to work now, we
both have a lot on our plates...

01:50.959 --> 01:53.893
maybe we should just dial
it back a little this year.

01:53.993 --> 01:55.459
- Dial it back? 
- Mm-hmm.

01:55.461 --> 01:57.027
Oh, no, we have to amp it up

01:57.029 --> 01:58.395
because I'm back at work.

01:58.925 --> 02:00.664
Look, I... I want the kids to know that

02:00.666 --> 02:04.602
I may have a job now, but
my heart is still at home,

02:04.604 --> 02:06.937
covered with tinsel.

02:08.074 --> 02:10.541
So that's a no on dialing it back?

02:10.543 --> 02:12.376
Look, I know it's a lot,

02:12.378 --> 02:14.211
but... look, on Christmas morning

02:14.213 --> 02:16.347
when those kids come
running down those stairs

02:16.349 --> 02:19.079
to open their presents,
it's-it's magical.

02:19.104 --> 02:20.317
It's my magical moment,

02:20.319 --> 02:22.918
and it makes all the hard work worth it.

02:22.943 --> 02:25.456
Hey, if you really want
to amp up Christmas,

02:25.458 --> 02:27.858
I suggest a trip to Decoration Station.

02:27.860 --> 02:30.127
Oh, I love that place!

02:30.663 --> 02:32.783
5,000 square feet

02:32.808 --> 02:35.132
of things to hang on a tree.

02:35.134 --> 02:38.002
The choices will bring
Adam to his knees.

02:43.494 --> 02:44.808
What are you doing?

02:46.003 --> 02:48.325
I'm trying to send you to
some more boring stores,

02:48.350 --> 02:50.517
'cause I think it's funny.

02:51.717 --> 02:54.118
- Aw...
- Aw...

02:54.120 --> 02:56.820
You guys better untangle those.

02:57.572 --> 02:58.440
Andi's on

02:58.465 --> 02:59.723
a holiday roll, man.

02:59.725 --> 03:01.358
You got some tough weeks ahead of you.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.027
Yeah, but she loves it.

03:03.029 --> 03:04.995
Happy wife, happy life.

03:05.865 --> 03:07.631
Happy husband...

03:07.633 --> 03:10.834
It's so unimportant nobody
even tried to rhyme it.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.070
You know,

03:13.072 --> 03:16.641
there is a way out of this...
outsource it. Fix it so that

03:16.666 --> 03:18.869
you guys spend Christmas
with one of the grandparents.

03:18.894 --> 03:20.377
Let them do all the work.

03:20.653 --> 03:22.534
Well, we can't go to our folks.

03:22.559 --> 03:24.281
Things are weird between Mom and Andi

03:24.283 --> 03:27.251
since she caught Andi
staring at her chin whisker.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.669
You could strum a
guitar with that thing.

03:30.923 --> 03:32.221
But you know what?

03:32.246 --> 03:34.785
Andi's parents could work. Yeah, I mean,

03:34.810 --> 03:37.494
they're both active,
they're both clean-shaven...

03:38.354 --> 03:38.993
and they're both

03:39.018 --> 03:41.059
as crazy about Christmas as she is.

03:41.168 --> 03:42.489
You know, they'd do all the prep.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.201
It'd take a lot of pressure off Andi.

03:44.203 --> 03:45.536
And less work for you.

03:45.538 --> 03:47.237
Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that.

03:47.989 --> 03:49.707
Mm, I don't know, though, you know.

03:49.709 --> 03:52.276
If I suggest it, she's
gonna know I have an angle.

03:52.278 --> 03:55.479
She's smart, Don... it's
her only bad quality.

03:55.481 --> 03:57.314
You don't suggest it to Andi.

03:57.316 --> 04:00.117
Call her parents, say
the grandkids miss them,

04:00.119 --> 04:02.086
sit back, let it happen.

04:02.903 --> 04:04.027
It's like taking candy

04:04.052 --> 04:06.423
from... a really old baby.

04:07.027 --> 04:08.527
I love this idea.

04:08.552 --> 04:09.893
I'm gonna call them right now.

04:09.895 --> 04:12.329
I'm right here if anything goes wrong.

04:12.878 --> 04:14.765
You haven't moved all day.

04:14.767 --> 04:16.266
True.

04:17.498 --> 04:19.403
Frank. It's Adam.

04:19.404 --> 04:20.726
How's things in Virginia Beach?

04:20.750 --> 04:22.139
You guys getting ready for Christmas?

04:23.008 --> 04:25.976
Yeah, the kids sure would
love to see you this year.

04:26.746 --> 04:30.280
Huh? Spend Christmas at your place?

04:32.294 --> 04:34.084
I'm in. But run it by Andi.

04:34.086 --> 04:37.287
Yeah, but say it came from you;
don't tell her it was my idea.

04:37.289 --> 04:39.167
Why? U-Uh...

04:39.192 --> 04:40.384
Hold on a sec.

04:40.409 --> 04:41.875
Why?

04:42.812 --> 04:44.194
Just hang up.

04:48.701 --> 04:52.169
Uh, because I want you guys to
get credit for this great idea.

04:52.171 --> 04:53.604
Yeah.

04:53.606 --> 04:55.439
Okay. Oh.

04:55.441 --> 04:57.508
Ho-ho-ho to you, too.

04:59.000 --> 05:05.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

05:08.466 --> 05:10.453
Hey, um, my folks just called.

05:10.478 --> 05:12.845
They want us to go to
Virginia Beach for Christmas.

05:12.847 --> 05:14.346
What?

05:17.118 --> 05:19.652
That's out of the blue.

05:19.654 --> 05:21.536
Yeah, but we should
just stay here, right?

05:21.561 --> 05:23.689
Definitely, yeah.

05:23.691 --> 05:26.759
On the other hand...

05:26.761 --> 05:29.095
you know, now that I'm thinking
about it for the first time...

05:30.164 --> 05:31.897
it might make your life easier.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.100
You know, you said you
wanted an amped-up Christmas

05:34.102 --> 05:36.884
and you know your parents
go Christmas crazy.

05:36.909 --> 05:38.441
It's genetic.

05:40.517 --> 05:43.342
Yeah, I mean, they did
sound pretty excited.

05:43.344 --> 05:46.579
And I guess it would
be less work for us.

05:46.706 --> 05:48.305
Would it be?

05:48.330 --> 05:51.365
I don't know, let's just do it and see.

05:52.737 --> 05:54.520
Yeah, I mean, I suppose we could do

05:54.522 --> 05:57.356
all our Christmas Eve
traditions down there, right?

05:57.358 --> 05:59.525
I mean, like, buying the tree,

05:59.527 --> 06:01.293
and wrapping the presents,

06:01.295 --> 06:03.529
and bandaging your paper cuts

06:03.531 --> 06:05.131
from wrapping the presents.

06:05.666 --> 06:06.796
Three generations,

06:06.821 --> 06:08.954
celebrating the holiday together.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.505
You know, now that I'm
over the surprise of it,

06:12.507 --> 06:14.874
I got to say, that sounds pretty good.

06:14.876 --> 06:18.811
I'll call it "Christmas
Through the Generations."

06:18.813 --> 06:19.912
You know, we've never

06:19.914 --> 06:21.408
taken a picture with my parents

06:21.433 --> 06:22.865
all in the same sweater.

06:24.118 --> 06:27.086
You are knocking me out, lady.

06:27.088 --> 06:29.822
And I'll still get my magic
moment Christmas morning.

06:30.424 --> 06:31.346
I love it.

06:31.371 --> 06:33.437
I'm gonna go check flights to Virginia.

06:33.462 --> 06:35.929
That's a great idea. Yeah.

06:35.954 --> 06:37.721
You know, I got to say,
I feel a little silly

06:37.746 --> 06:39.879
that I didn't think of this one myself.

06:42.997 --> 06:43.836
Well, you got to admit,

06:43.838 --> 06:44.680
all this free time

06:44.705 --> 06:46.435
has been pretty relaxing, right?

06:46.474 --> 06:47.529
Yeah.

06:47.554 --> 06:49.621
Weird, but relaxing.

06:50.081 --> 06:51.402
Oh, I talked to my parents

06:51.427 --> 06:53.122
and they are taking care of everything.

06:53.279 --> 06:54.612
They even had our traditional

06:54.614 --> 06:56.647
pre-Christmas fight for us.

06:56.649 --> 06:59.684
Oh, and we're all set
on the kids' gifts.

06:59.686 --> 07:00.918
I ordered everything online,

07:00.920 --> 07:02.518
I had it sent directly to Virginia.

07:02.543 --> 07:03.554
It was amazing.

07:03.556 --> 07:04.488
I'd pick one thing

07:04.490 --> 07:05.489
and the Internet would say,

07:05.491 --> 07:06.524
"If you like this,

07:06.526 --> 07:07.558
you might also like this."

07:07.560 --> 07:09.660
And I did, every time.

07:10.196 --> 07:11.195
Mommy, I finished

07:11.197 --> 07:12.363
my letter to Santa.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.865
Oh, good job, sweetie.

07:14.867 --> 07:17.101
Just in case he didn't
get your first 17.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.770
I'm not taking any chances.

07:21.488 --> 07:22.673
So, how'd you do?

07:22.675 --> 07:23.908
I got everything,

07:23.910 --> 07:26.844
except the baby sister.

07:31.034 --> 07:31.878
Mom,

07:31.903 --> 07:33.784
did you tell Dad about
who stopped by earlier?

07:33.786 --> 07:36.187
Oh, yeah, Carol
Robertson from next door.

07:36.189 --> 07:37.321
Yeah, she dropped off

07:37.323 --> 07:38.389
her keys so we could

07:38.391 --> 07:39.724
watch their place while they're away,

07:39.726 --> 07:40.725
but really,

07:40.727 --> 07:42.193
it was really just an excuse to brag

07:42.195 --> 07:44.562
about their two-week
vacation to Hawaii.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.597
Well, did you tell her
that we'd be spending

07:46.599 --> 07:49.098
the next three days in Virginia Beach,

07:49.278 --> 07:52.447
the Hawaii of Virginia?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.985
Yeah, she said we had
the shortest vacation

07:55.010 --> 07:56.242
of anyone she knew.

07:56.586 --> 07:58.134
And then she flipped her hair so hard

07:58.159 --> 07:59.677
she almost fell off the porch.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.591
Yeah,

08:02.616 --> 08:04.782
Sasha Robertson is the
meanest girl in our class.

08:04.784 --> 08:06.884
She started a rumor that I wear a wig.

08:06.886 --> 08:09.520
And I know she got a nose job.

08:09.522 --> 08:10.654
I mean, sure, you get hit in the face

08:10.656 --> 08:13.591
with a volleyball and
your nose gets cuter?

08:14.418 --> 08:16.627
Why can't you just tell
people you don't wear a wig?

08:17.372 --> 08:18.215
In middle school,

08:18.240 --> 08:19.206
the more you deny something,

08:19.231 --> 08:21.198
the more people believe it.

08:22.606 --> 08:23.768
Ow!

08:23.770 --> 08:25.035
Give it a yank, Dad.

08:25.037 --> 08:26.613
Something's going on there.

08:28.039 --> 08:30.129
Okay, I'm gonna walk away.
You do what you need to do.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.582
Merry Christmas Eve morning, babe. Huh?

08:39.975 --> 08:41.217
Honey, that blizzard

08:41.220 --> 08:43.020
that was supposed to
hit New York last night?

08:43.022 --> 08:45.022
- It hit us instead.
- Ooh.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.758
They say it's bigger
than the blizzard of '75.

08:47.760 --> 08:50.361
Ha! Take that, '75.

08:52.141 --> 08:53.958
No, the airports are closed.

08:53.983 --> 08:55.716
How are we gonna get to my parents'?

08:55.741 --> 08:57.601
I mean, I have a suitcase
full of matching sweaters

08:57.603 --> 08:59.136
and I need some old people to wear them.

08:59.774 --> 09:01.505
Okay, plan B:

09:01.507 --> 09:03.641
we are driving to Virginia.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.776
Yeah, who doesn't like
a road trip, right?

09:05.778 --> 09:09.013
And the lack of visibility
will make it exciting.

09:09.015 --> 09:11.382
Like a video game.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.983
Turn up the heat, it's cold.

09:12.985 --> 09:15.019
I hope your wig doesn't freeze.

09:15.021 --> 09:17.121
I'm going to choke you
while you're sleeping.

09:17.786 --> 09:18.789
All right, all right.

09:18.791 --> 09:21.759
No choking until after Christmas.

09:21.761 --> 09:23.060
Look,

09:23.062 --> 09:24.195
the Robertsons keep posting

09:24.197 --> 09:25.796
bikini selfies from Hawaii.

09:26.265 --> 09:27.226
Give me that.

09:28.574 --> 09:30.307
Hey, give me that.

09:31.666 --> 09:33.332
Give me that!

09:34.707 --> 09:36.417
All right, let's hit the road.

09:36.442 --> 09:38.342
Virginia, here we come.

09:43.950 --> 09:45.583
I don't think we're moving.

09:46.282 --> 09:47.618
Guys, I don't think we're making it

09:47.620 --> 09:49.720
to Virginia for Christmas.

09:49.722 --> 09:51.388
Then I'm going back inside.

09:51.390 --> 09:52.356
It's windy out there.

09:52.358 --> 09:53.524
Hold on to your wig.

09:54.448 --> 09:55.863
Don't fall asleep, Teddy.

09:56.395 --> 09:58.229
Don't ever fall asleep.

10:02.468 --> 10:04.668
Well, I could try and dig us out.

10:04.670 --> 10:05.903
Oh, no.

10:05.905 --> 10:08.038
They just closed all the roads.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.554
Okay, okay, all right,

10:09.579 --> 10:10.841
so we'll have just
have Christmas at home.

10:10.843 --> 10:11.909
Like we always do.

10:11.911 --> 10:13.344
But it won't be the same.

10:13.346 --> 10:15.145
I mean, we don't have anything ready.

10:15.147 --> 10:16.380
We don't even have a tree.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.119
Or do we?

10:23.996 --> 10:26.624
Okay, I think you know
where you can put that.

10:27.229 --> 10:28.861
Oh, I know it's awful.

10:28.886 --> 10:31.083
But we can't control the weather, Dad.

10:32.028 --> 10:33.274
What?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.065
Why would Adam be disappointed?

10:36.748 --> 10:37.968
Oh.

10:38.259 --> 10:41.027
Coming to see you was his idea.

10:42.177 --> 10:43.776
Just hang up.

10:50.602 --> 10:53.355
So this whole trip to
Virginia was a scam.

10:53.545 --> 10:55.022
You went behind my back,

10:55.047 --> 10:57.075
you manipulated my parents,

10:57.077 --> 10:59.277
and you set into
motion a chain of events

10:59.279 --> 11:02.514
that effectively ruined
Christmas for everyone.

11:04.785 --> 11:06.931
To be fair... okay?

11:06.956 --> 11:09.921
If it hadn't snowed and
you hadn't found out,

11:09.923 --> 11:11.289
you wouldn't be mad right now.

11:11.815 --> 11:12.559
Okay, so,

11:12.584 --> 11:14.688
I think we're both victims

11:14.713 --> 11:16.980
of bad luck.

11:17.658 --> 11:20.950
Just... walk me through
your thought process.

11:20.952 --> 11:22.499
Well, I was talking to Don...

11:22.524 --> 11:23.945
Ah.

11:26.198 --> 11:28.398
So there was no thought process.

11:28.423 --> 11:30.060
Okay, I'm sorry, all right?

11:30.085 --> 11:31.010
But I was thinking of you.

11:31.035 --> 11:33.169
I felt like you were taking on too much.

11:33.171 --> 11:34.771
And you got to admit,
these last three weeks

11:34.773 --> 11:36.806
have been very relaxing.

11:36.808 --> 11:39.675
Do I look relaxed now?

11:39.677 --> 11:41.547
Well, I think you look
beautiful, baby. Come on.

11:41.572 --> 11:44.173
No, no, no, no, no, no.

11:44.198 --> 11:46.904
I think you were just trying to
get out of all the holiday work.

11:47.420 --> 11:49.519
Well, sure, there was
a little bit of that.

11:49.521 --> 11:52.026
But you got to look at it
from my perspective, okay?

11:52.051 --> 11:55.052
Every year, I take friendly
fire from Christmas Andi.

11:55.193 --> 11:56.463
You know? You remember the time

11:56.488 --> 11:57.289
you made me put

11:57.314 --> 11:58.865
the inflatable Santa up on the roof

11:58.890 --> 12:00.187
and the wind picked up?

12:00.212 --> 12:03.947
Me and Kris Kringle parasailed
into the church parking lot.

12:05.389 --> 12:07.203
Okay, that was scary.

12:07.205 --> 12:10.773
And a little funny, but...

12:11.213 --> 12:14.243
I guess I can go a little
bit overboard at Christmas.

12:14.245 --> 12:16.237
All right, look, honey,

12:16.262 --> 12:19.282
I love that you want
Christmases to be great.

12:19.409 --> 12:20.360
You're adorable.

12:20.385 --> 12:22.591
It's like being married to a...

12:22.616 --> 12:24.048
sexy elf.

12:25.272 --> 12:27.581
And I'm sorry this
isn't what we expected,

12:27.606 --> 12:29.081
but you know what?

12:29.106 --> 12:31.037
I think we have the makings

12:31.062 --> 12:33.068
of a classic Christmas here.

12:33.093 --> 12:35.264
We got snow, family.

12:35.266 --> 12:37.867
Forgiveness.

12:40.338 --> 12:42.305
Huh?

12:43.143 --> 12:43.845
Fine.

12:43.870 --> 12:45.010
But I just want you
to know that, normally,

12:45.035 --> 12:47.135
I would stay mad longer,
but Christmas Andi's

12:47.160 --> 12:48.660
just too freaking jolly.

12:48.880 --> 12:51.047
You know what we'll do? We'll have a...

12:51.395 --> 12:54.150
simple, old-fashioned Christmas.

12:54.152 --> 12:55.551
- Yeah.
- We can

12:55.553 --> 12:57.186
make our own decorations,

12:57.188 --> 12:59.522
sing songs by the fire.

12:59.524 --> 13:01.787
You know what? I'm actually
getting excited about this.

13:01.812 --> 13:02.969
You know, there's no reason

13:02.994 --> 13:05.839
that this can't be one of
our best Christmases ever.

13:06.452 --> 13:08.491
Hey, if we don't have a tree,

13:08.516 --> 13:11.067
where is Santa gonna
put all our presents?

13:13.173 --> 13:13.937
What?

13:16.925 --> 13:17.784
Presents.

13:18.109 --> 13:19.408
She said "presents."

13:19.410 --> 13:21.310
Yes, I-I heard her.

13:22.185 --> 13:24.488
Uh, okay, uh... here's
the thing, sweetie,

13:24.513 --> 13:26.947
um, Santa thinks we're in Virginia.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.238
Yes, yes.

13:28.263 --> 13:29.905
That's a good point. Yeah.

13:29.930 --> 13:32.288
Listen, honey, honey, you know,

13:32.357 --> 13:35.825
Santa is gonna deliver all
the presents to Virginia

13:35.827 --> 13:38.363
because he doesn't
know we're stuck here.

13:38.388 --> 13:42.424
Daddy, he sees you when you're sleeping.

13:43.101 --> 13:45.268
He knows when you're awake.

13:46.677 --> 13:49.978
He knows we're in Pittsburgh.

13:53.044 --> 13:54.289
Okay.

13:55.914 --> 13:58.080
That's really an
ironclad argument there.

14:02.807 --> 14:04.153
Well?

14:04.155 --> 14:05.683
Why aren't I one of those moms

14:05.708 --> 14:07.876
that buys extra toys
in case of emergencies?

14:07.908 --> 14:10.575
Because there's no such
thing as a toy emergency.

14:10.577 --> 14:12.177
Oh, really? 'Cause I think we
might be in the middle of one

14:12.179 --> 14:13.611
right now.

14:13.613 --> 14:16.559
- You haven't found anything?
- No. Just...

14:16.584 --> 14:19.017
an unopened box of birth control pills.

14:23.263 --> 14:24.989
Well, that's troubling.

14:25.831 --> 14:27.418
Look, we've got to find something.

14:27.443 --> 14:28.539
- I mean...
- Okay, okay.

14:28.564 --> 14:30.267
Okay, I want you to
see those happy faces

14:30.292 --> 14:31.628
on Christmas morning, all right?

14:31.653 --> 14:33.736
All right, um... you
and the kids get started

14:33.761 --> 14:35.288
on the decorations,
and I'm gonna head out

14:35.313 --> 14:36.434
and find us some presents.

14:36.436 --> 14:38.303
Wha... but the whole
town is closed down.

14:38.305 --> 14:41.105
This is America, somebody's
always selling something.

14:42.902 --> 14:44.535
I like Crafty Christmas, Mom.

14:44.537 --> 14:47.171
- I think our tree's cute.
- It is, isn't it?

14:47.173 --> 14:50.109
Who needs a fresh-cut tree
when you've got Christmas spirit

14:50.134 --> 14:52.602
and Mommy's drying rack?

14:53.780 --> 14:56.514
You have a nice rack, Mommy.

14:58.332 --> 15:00.918
It's a... drying rack, sweetie.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.354
You got to say "drying"
if you're gonna say "rack."

15:04.321 --> 15:06.473
Hey, there's my Christmas elves.

15:06.498 --> 15:08.829
Wow, look at that tree.

15:08.854 --> 15:09.794
Yeah.

15:09.796 --> 15:11.713
All our real decorations
are in the garage,

15:11.738 --> 15:13.097
which is frozen shut, but you know what?

15:13.099 --> 15:15.845
I think I handled that
setback like a champ

15:15.870 --> 15:17.336
thanks to my new friend,

15:17.361 --> 15:18.827
peppermint schnapps.

15:21.176 --> 15:22.006
Look.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.768
I made a nativity scene

15:23.793 --> 15:25.276
out of my Transformers.

15:25.715 --> 15:27.745
Baby Jesus transforms into a car,

15:27.747 --> 15:29.514
'cause I think he could.

15:30.808 --> 15:32.884
Well, sure he could, honey.

15:32.886 --> 15:34.805
We really got to get him
back in Sunday School.

15:34.830 --> 15:35.787
Yeah.

15:36.781 --> 15:38.720
So, uh, you guys, uh, keep decorating.

15:38.745 --> 15:40.010
I just... I got to talk
to Daddy in the kitchen

15:40.035 --> 15:41.200
for a minute, okay?

15:42.319 --> 15:43.394
So...

15:43.692 --> 15:45.158
how'd it go with the kids' presents?

15:45.423 --> 15:46.664
Before I tell you,

15:47.022 --> 15:48.499
they won't look good unless you know

15:48.501 --> 15:51.702
that the only place open that I
could walk to was a gas station.

15:54.885 --> 15:55.696
That being said,

15:55.721 --> 15:57.987
- I tried to be very thoughtful, okay?
- Okay.

15:58.012 --> 16:00.125
Okay, Katie's taking Spanish, right?

16:00.150 --> 16:01.512
So I got her...

16:02.187 --> 16:03.815
taquitos.

16:06.773 --> 16:08.592
I got a pool toy for Emme.

16:08.617 --> 16:10.123
But we might have to
change the packaging

16:10.148 --> 16:12.515
'cause it says, "Trucker's
Hemorrhoid Ring."

16:16.229 --> 16:18.162
And I got Teddy this really cool funnel.

16:18.164 --> 16:20.031
You know, in case he wants
to pour a lot of liquid

16:20.033 --> 16:22.233
into a really small opening.

16:24.504 --> 16:26.387
- We can't give them these.
- What?

16:26.412 --> 16:29.379
I mean, sure, Teddy's gonna
love that funnel, but...

16:29.742 --> 16:31.714
the rest of this stuff is no good.

16:31.739 --> 16:34.353
You know what I love best
about our tree, Mommy?

16:34.462 --> 16:35.813
Oh, what's that, sweetie?

16:36.096 --> 16:38.385
That's where all our
presents are gonna go.

16:38.410 --> 16:40.496
Oh, that's right, sweet pea.
You're not even gonna be able to

16:40.521 --> 16:43.688
see the tree because all the presents.

16:43.965 --> 16:45.723
Yay!

16:47.160 --> 16:48.893
Why?

16:49.167 --> 16:50.944
I didn't want to disappoint her today,

16:50.969 --> 16:53.497
because tomorrow is gonna be brutal.

16:53.499 --> 16:55.687
Yeah, because we don't have
any presents to put under

16:55.712 --> 16:57.292
our drying-rack tree,

16:57.317 --> 16:59.670
which is decorated with
spoons and chip clips.

17:00.397 --> 17:02.340
I mean, those kids are
gonna be devastated tomorrow

17:02.342 --> 17:03.692
and it's all thanks to you.

17:03.717 --> 17:05.076
Wha... hey.

17:05.078 --> 17:06.423
Hey, hey!

17:08.017 --> 17:09.449
What happened? I thought we made up.

17:09.473 --> 17:11.082
I forgave you too quickly.

17:11.084 --> 17:13.355
Christmas Andi's just
a soft-hearted fool.

17:16.955 --> 17:19.390
- That's the pantry!
- Yeah.

17:23.496 --> 17:25.396
Hey, Butterbean,

17:25.397 --> 17:26.864
why are you still awake?

17:27.098 --> 17:29.377
We forgot to put out cookies for Santa.

17:29.402 --> 17:31.969
Ah.

17:31.971 --> 17:33.581
Uh, listen, Emme,

17:33.908 --> 17:35.306
you know, I'm still a little worried

17:35.331 --> 17:37.199
that Santa might not
have gotten the message

17:37.224 --> 17:38.876
that we're stuck in Pittsburgh.

17:39.143 --> 17:40.976
You worry too much.

17:41.800 --> 17:43.750
Well, I just don't want
you to be disappointed

17:43.775 --> 17:45.082
if he doesn't come tonight.

17:45.319 --> 17:48.185
The only reason Santa wouldn't come

17:48.187 --> 17:50.012
is if I wasn't good this year.

17:50.037 --> 17:52.264
Oh, honey, you're the best kid

17:52.289 --> 17:53.391
there ever was.

17:53.393 --> 17:54.400
Daddy,

17:54.425 --> 17:56.327
can you tell me a bedtime story?

17:56.329 --> 17:57.361
Oh, okay.

17:57.639 --> 17:58.874
Here, come here.

18:02.101 --> 18:03.664
Uh...

18:03.689 --> 18:06.470
'Twas the night before Christmas.

18:06.472 --> 18:10.604
And a handsome prince
had angered his princess

18:10.629 --> 18:12.910
because he foolishly listened

18:13.244 --> 18:16.080
to an idiot giant named Don.

18:16.657 --> 18:18.192
That's like Uncle Don.

18:18.217 --> 18:21.552
Exactly like Uncle Don.

18:27.427 --> 18:29.812
- Oh, right in the jingle bells.
- Come on!

18:29.837 --> 18:31.644
- Let's go open our presents!
- Come on!

18:31.669 --> 18:33.164
No, no, no, you guys, hold on, wait.

18:33.166 --> 18:34.265
Let's go, let's go, let's
go, let's go, let's go!

18:34.603 --> 18:36.503
Oh...

18:36.595 --> 18:38.535
This is gonna be so tough.

18:38.560 --> 18:40.726
Okay, you ready for this?

18:41.363 --> 18:42.440
Yeah.

18:42.442 --> 18:45.009
I'll just put some
schnapps in my coffee.

18:53.786 --> 18:54.719
Oh...

18:54.721 --> 18:57.855
my God.

18:57.857 --> 19:01.993
Merry Christmas.

19:01.995 --> 19:04.917
Oh, my God, oh, my God, oh, my God!

19:04.942 --> 19:07.248
See, I told you Santa would come.

19:07.942 --> 19:09.351
A doll house!

19:10.911 --> 19:12.620
Oh, cool, an Xbox.

19:12.645 --> 19:15.079
And a funnel!

19:19.497 --> 19:20.863
What is happening?

19:20.888 --> 19:22.980
Where did all this stuff come from?

19:22.982 --> 19:25.429
Well, last night, I
was feeling really bad

19:25.454 --> 19:26.917
so I went out in the backyard

19:26.919 --> 19:28.185
and I looked up at the stars,

19:28.187 --> 19:30.405
and I wished with all my might

19:30.430 --> 19:32.623
for a Christmas miracle.

19:33.657 --> 19:35.026
And that worked?

19:35.028 --> 19:36.160
No!

19:37.049 --> 19:39.037
No, then I remembered we
had a key to the Robertson's,

19:39.062 --> 19:40.862
so I just went over there
and stole everything.

19:45.104 --> 19:46.370
Aw.

19:46.372 --> 19:48.343
You stole me my magic moment.

19:49.373 --> 19:51.044
This is the best Christmas ever.

19:51.046 --> 19:53.120
Aw.

19:53.145 --> 19:54.912
And don't worry, I'll
put everything back.

19:54.914 --> 19:56.213
When the Robertsons get home,

19:56.215 --> 19:57.915
everything will be
just like they left it.

19:57.917 --> 19:59.683
Except it's gonna stink,

19:59.685 --> 20:02.319
'cause I stashed a
taquito in their air vent.

20:07.975 --> 20:09.675
That's weird.

20:09.677 --> 20:11.009
All I got was this old notebook.

20:11.011 --> 20:12.886
Oh, did you open it?

20:18.491 --> 20:19.685
Oh, my God!

20:20.222 --> 20:21.987
It's Sasha Robertson's diary!

20:27.211 --> 20:29.745
And she did have a nose job!

20:31.974 --> 20:33.632
It's a Christmas miracle.
