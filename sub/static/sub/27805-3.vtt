WEBVTT

00:00.907 --> 00:05.502
Check me out, Clem. I'm ready to go
to Walt and Rose's on time. Happy?

00:05.512 --> 00:06.748
I would be happier

00:06.808 --> 00:08.905
if you weren't wearing
my favorite pants.

00:10.734 --> 00:11.734
Oh, honey,

00:11.778 --> 00:13.823
you can't pull these off.

00:15.173 --> 00:16.826
Whoa, those are some dope kicks.

00:16.870 --> 00:18.001
When'd you get Yeezys?

00:18.045 --> 00:19.568
Bigger question:

00:19.612 --> 00:22.528
How does someone in their
late 40s know what Yeezys are?

00:22.571 --> 00:25.052
I'm 30 and a college professor.

00:25.096 --> 00:27.054
My finger is on the pulse.

00:27.638 --> 00:30.275
He just learned about
them on 60 Minutes.

00:31.754 --> 00:32.755
That is not true.

00:32.799 --> 00:36.933
It was the Sunday Style section
of The New York Times. Thank you.

00:37.836 --> 00:39.480
How'd you pay for Yeezys, Shannon?

00:39.506 --> 00:40.923
Aren't they super expensive?

00:40.973 --> 00:42.896
Won 'em off some dumb rich girl.

00:42.939 --> 00:44.158
You know how when someone gets arrested

00:44.202 --> 00:45.377
they'll read their Miranda rights?

00:45.420 --> 00:49.076
- Mm-hmm.
- I bet her I can recite 'em by heart.

00:49.694 --> 00:51.339
How do you know the Miranda rights?

00:51.383 --> 00:54.212
- Because our dad is a cop.
- Mm.

00:54.255 --> 00:56.649
Yeah, that's... why I know them.

00:57.650 --> 01:00.000
So, who is this girl?

01:00.043 --> 01:01.741
Some stuck-up idiot.

01:01.784 --> 01:03.177
My new school's full of 'em.

01:03.221 --> 01:04.700
Always doing their
makeup in the bathroom

01:04.744 --> 01:06.746
when people are just trying to vape.

01:07.608 --> 01:09.923
Other people. Bad people.

01:10.430 --> 01:12.247
It never changes.

01:12.291 --> 01:14.641
When I was in high school,
the mean girls, they would...

01:14.684 --> 01:17.731
talk about me behind my back and
start rumors that I was a slut.

01:17.774 --> 01:20.125
And also rumors that weren't true.

01:23.770 --> 01:24.999
Got it.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.743
Freddy, my man!

01:34.530 --> 01:36.663
Dad. Hi. You're here.

01:37.196 --> 01:40.014
Yet we did not invite you.

01:40.058 --> 01:42.321
I need a family picture
for that newsletter thing

01:42.364 --> 01:44.323
they put out at the precinct.

01:44.366 --> 01:46.760
It's... it's silly,
but in the next issue,

01:46.803 --> 01:49.023
- I'm Hero of the Month.
- Nice, Freddy.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.286
What'd you do, like,
solve some big murder case?

01:51.330 --> 01:53.506
Well, I hate to brag, but, uh...

01:53.549 --> 01:56.204
I'm sleeping with the woman
who puts out the newsletter.

01:58.208 --> 01:59.294
Here.

01:59.765 --> 02:03.385
- Take a picture of me and my girls.
- Sure thing. You know,

02:03.429 --> 02:05.997
I called you the other day
about lunch... did you get my message?

02:06.040 --> 02:09.130
Yep. Now, take the picture,
Annie Leibovitz.

02:10.088 --> 02:13.526
So I guess that's a no on Benihana.

02:16.094 --> 02:18.400
Great. Now, Shannon,
here, you put this on.

02:18.444 --> 02:19.619
What is this?

02:19.662 --> 02:21.142
Dad, it's not my birthday.

02:21.186 --> 02:24.493
Well, it's in case they
make me Hero again in July.

02:24.537 --> 02:26.017
Ugh.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.803
My birthday's in November.

02:29.846 --> 02:32.066
Whatever. Just smile.

02:32.369 --> 02:33.894
- Got it.
- Great.

02:33.937 --> 02:35.374
Dad, what's really going on?

02:35.417 --> 02:38.464
Why do you ruin every nice
moment that we have, Clem?

02:38.897 --> 02:44.035
Come on, we'll do graduation
and a couple of Christmas shots.

02:44.078 --> 02:45.819
Come on, Dad, spill it.

02:46.863 --> 02:48.376
All right. Fine.

02:48.409 --> 02:52.183
Those bastards at the IRS are
sending an agent over to audit me,

02:52.195 --> 02:54.523
and I've been claiming
you as dependents.

02:55.096 --> 02:57.692
So I need to scatter some
photos around my place

02:57.736 --> 03:01.391
to make it look like you're
still living with me.

03:02.068 --> 03:05.657
Also, I'm gonna need a couple
of bras to hang in the bathroom.

03:08.434 --> 03:09.269
Come on, Freddy,

03:09.312 --> 03:10.792
what's... what's the real story?

03:12.228 --> 03:15.057
Oh, my God, that's the real story.

03:18.043 --> 03:19.622
Dad, how are you a cop

03:19.657 --> 03:22.107
and yet basically everything
you do is illegal?

03:22.142 --> 03:24.371
What am I gonna do, arrest myself?

03:26.200 --> 03:28.201
Quick Halloween one.

03:29.202 --> 03:31.465
Boo!

03:38.892 --> 03:39.908
Hey! Ah...

03:39.952 --> 03:42.615
here are our favorite people.

03:42.650 --> 03:44.173
- Hey.
- Ooh, thank you.

03:44.217 --> 03:46.045
Now, see, this is how you greet family.

03:47.329 --> 03:49.246
Oh, my God, Nick,
are you still butt-hurt

03:49.281 --> 03:51.224
because my dad doesn't want
to be besties with you?

03:51.267 --> 03:52.747
I'm just trying to have a relationship

03:52.791 --> 03:54.793
with a guy that's gonna
be my father-in-law.

03:54.836 --> 03:57.447
And if that makes me butt-hurt,
then yes, my butt is hurt.

03:58.745 --> 04:01.625
I don't know why you think
my dad's ever gonna like you.

04:01.669 --> 04:03.105
The man doesn't like anybody.

04:03.149 --> 04:05.847
I once saw him flip off a baby.

04:05.891 --> 04:09.198
Well, how could anyone not like my son?
Mwah!

04:09.242 --> 04:11.592
Well, maybe it's because
Nick never asked Freddy

04:11.635 --> 04:13.463
for his blessing to marry Clem.

04:13.507 --> 04:14.943
Well, it never crossed my mind,

04:14.987 --> 04:17.031
because I was under the
impression that Freddy was dead.

04:17.076 --> 04:20.732
You know,
because Clem told me he was dead.

04:22.342 --> 04:25.236
I only told you that because I thought

04:25.271 --> 04:27.443
that if you ever met him,
you would think less of me.

04:27.478 --> 04:29.915
And then you met Shannon,
and I realized that...

04:29.958 --> 04:32.569
you'd accept anything.

04:33.657 --> 04:35.485
You know, Nick, honey,
it's never too late.

04:35.529 --> 04:37.009
There's still time to ask Freddy.

04:37.871 --> 04:39.638
- Maybe I should.
- No. Please.

04:39.673 --> 04:42.188
- I don't care.
- Yeah, but maybe your dad does.

04:42.231 --> 04:46.311
You know, I remember asking
Rose's dad for his blessing.

04:46.346 --> 04:48.617
Made a special appointment
to talk to him.

04:48.652 --> 04:51.675
And you were so stressed out,

04:51.719 --> 04:54.156
'cause you were late.

04:55.263 --> 04:57.492
Well, I was starring in a
Broadway production of Hair

04:57.527 --> 04:59.466
at the time...
I got mobbed at the stage door.

05:00.769 --> 05:01.785
He got his fro

05:01.820 --> 05:03.687
caught in a fan.

05:06.038 --> 05:07.822
But he gave me his blessing

05:07.866 --> 05:10.520
and his watch... it was his way
of welcoming me to the family.

05:10.564 --> 05:12.348
Wait, wait.
Is this the watch that's engraved:

05:12.392 --> 05:14.481
"Show up on time, you little bastard"?

05:15.389 --> 05:16.135
That's the one.

05:16.178 --> 05:17.745
I'll get it for us.

05:17.789 --> 05:19.355
You know, I miss Grandpa.

05:19.399 --> 05:20.704
He was such a hard-ass.

05:20.748 --> 05:22.576
Oh, he was.

05:23.357 --> 05:26.929
That man fought his way
through the Korean War.

05:26.964 --> 05:28.582
Really? Where was he stationed?

05:28.625 --> 05:30.627
At home with my mother.

05:33.464 --> 05:35.545
Uh, guys, I can't find the watch.

05:35.589 --> 05:36.938
It's gone.

05:36.982 --> 05:38.200
Someone must have stolen it.

05:38.244 --> 05:39.811
Are you sure, Walt?

05:39.854 --> 05:42.145
It was in a locked drawer.

05:42.556 --> 05:43.336
Who could've done it?

05:44.180 --> 05:46.519
I know... the handyman!

05:46.554 --> 05:49.603
He was in our bedroom with a wrench.

05:50.521 --> 05:52.519
What is this, a game of Clue?

05:53.737 --> 05:55.420
No way it was Arthur.

05:55.455 --> 05:56.392
He's a nice, sweet old man.

05:56.436 --> 05:57.567
If not him, who?

05:59.606 --> 06:00.570
Yeah.

06:00.614 --> 06:03.269
If not him, who?

06:04.154 --> 06:05.036
Yeah.

06:05.559 --> 06:08.143
If not him, who?

06:11.712 --> 06:13.627
So, Shannon,

06:13.670 --> 06:15.672
tell me again how you got those shoes?

06:15.716 --> 06:18.284
Told you. Won them off that rich guy.

06:18.327 --> 06:20.721
You said it was a girl.

06:20.764 --> 06:24.681
Uh, yeah, that's because it was a girl.

06:26.118 --> 06:28.076
But now it's a guy.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.705
You see, kids don't identify anymore.

06:31.740 --> 06:33.218
Hes are shes. Shes are hes.

06:33.253 --> 06:34.561
You're a dinosaur. Let's move on.

06:36.708 --> 06:38.695
Shannon, did you steal my dad's watch?

06:38.739 --> 06:39.740
Me?

06:40.502 --> 06:41.259
Steal?

06:42.351 --> 06:44.397
Never.

06:44.440 --> 06:45.485
Oh, please.

06:45.528 --> 06:47.879
You stole a taxi when you were 13.

06:49.445 --> 06:50.882
- Really?
- Really.

06:50.925 --> 06:54.842
They caught her driving
a family of five to JFK.

06:55.722 --> 06:58.672
Yeah, and the cheap
bastards didn't even tip me.

06:59.738 --> 07:01.757
Shannon, tell us the truth,

07:01.792 --> 07:03.720
or we're gonna take your
phone away for a month.

07:04.862 --> 07:07.376
Okay. Okay, okay, fine, fine.
I did it. I did it.

07:07.420 --> 07:09.944
Yes! I knew she took it!
I told you she took it!

07:09.988 --> 07:13.469
Why am I celebrating? I am very angry!

07:13.513 --> 07:14.775
I'm sorry!

07:14.818 --> 07:15.863
Sorry is not gonna cut it.

07:15.907 --> 07:17.604
This is such a violation of our trust.

07:17.647 --> 07:18.953
How could you steal from my parents?

07:18.997 --> 07:20.607
Walt has, like, a million watches, dude.

07:20.650 --> 07:23.392
I took it two weeks ago,
and he just noticed it was gone.

07:23.436 --> 07:25.699
Just because someone doesn't
notice something is gone

07:25.742 --> 07:27.701
doesn't make it okay to steal.

07:27.744 --> 07:29.746
Well, then technically,
I can't be blamed,

07:29.790 --> 07:32.010
because I have never
heard that concept before.

07:32.053 --> 07:33.315
Shannon.

07:33.359 --> 07:34.447
They'll never find out.

07:34.490 --> 07:36.492
I used gloves, just like Dad taught us.

07:37.798 --> 07:39.408
Can everyone stop being so dramatic?

07:39.452 --> 07:40.801
I will get the watch back.

07:40.844 --> 07:43.158
Really? How? It's at a pawnshop.

07:43.193 --> 07:44.104
How are you gonna pay for that?

07:44.646 --> 07:46.807
I'll steal a taxi. Give me three days.

07:48.504 --> 07:51.330
No! The stealing has to stop.

07:51.365 --> 07:53.509
I can't believe that you would do this,
Shannon.

07:53.553 --> 07:55.685
And for a stupid pair of shoes?

07:55.729 --> 07:57.687
They're not just shoes, okay?

07:57.731 --> 07:58.819
What does that mean?

07:58.862 --> 08:01.778
I don't want to talk about it.

08:02.533 --> 08:04.259
What is going on, Shannon?

08:05.337 --> 08:06.174
It's just...

08:06.913 --> 08:10.000
everybody at this dumb,
bougie school has these,

08:10.035 --> 08:11.943
and... I'm already the weird new kid...

08:11.978 --> 08:13.399
I guess I just wanted to fit in.

08:15.729 --> 08:16.924
I get it.

08:16.968 --> 08:19.535
I remember wanting to fit in, too.

08:19.579 --> 08:23.235
That's how I ended up in mall jail
for stealing a belly button ring.

08:25.637 --> 08:27.543
There's a jail in the mall?

08:27.587 --> 08:29.241
- It's awesome.
- Yes. It's fun, actually.

08:30.633 --> 08:32.679
Look, this is no excuse.

08:32.722 --> 08:34.289
I'm sorry that you
were feeling left out,

08:34.332 --> 08:36.634
but we're going to Walt
and Rose's right now,

08:36.669 --> 08:38.337
and you're gonna tell them
the truth. Right, Nick?

08:38.380 --> 08:39.554
Uh-uh. No.

08:39.599 --> 08:41.121
No, no.

08:42.003 --> 08:43.124
No.

08:43.159 --> 08:44.647
What? We have to.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.781
My parents have a zero-tolerance
policy about stealing.

08:47.816 --> 08:48.608
You know my cousin Eddie?

08:48.651 --> 08:50.958
- No.
- Exactly.

08:51.851 --> 08:52.873
He stole from my parents

08:52.916 --> 08:55.745
one time, and he was banished
from the family forever.

08:55.789 --> 08:58.705
Banished? Like one
of those old ladies on The View

08:58.748 --> 09:01.012
when they talk back to Whoopi?

09:01.055 --> 09:04.058
Look, we can handle this without
my parents ever finding out.

09:04.102 --> 09:06.843
Right. Blame it on the handyman.

09:06.887 --> 09:09.498
I like where your head's at, kid.

09:09.542 --> 09:11.152
No. We're gonna get the
watch from the pawnshop,

09:11.196 --> 09:13.589
plant it in my parents'
place and claim we just found it.

09:13.633 --> 09:15.156
And you're gonna pay us back the money.

09:15.200 --> 09:19.117
Good idea. I just won't take
my next two months' allowance.

09:20.596 --> 09:22.772
We don't give you an allowance.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.602
Well, maybe if you did,

09:26.646 --> 09:29.083
we wouldn't be in this predicament.

09:36.544 --> 09:39.286
Man, there's a lot of tubas in here.

09:40.592 --> 09:42.594
I still can't believe
you stole the watch

09:42.637 --> 09:45.031
and sold it to a
sketchy place like this.

09:45.075 --> 09:46.424
Sketchy?

09:46.467 --> 09:48.861
Dude, Dad used to take us
here every Christmas Eve.

09:48.905 --> 09:50.950
Called it Santa's Workshop.

09:52.517 --> 09:55.346
He made me get my school supplies here.

09:55.389 --> 09:58.436
I got a lunchbox with a bullet hole.

09:58.479 --> 10:01.961
Lost a lot of Skittles that year.

10:02.005 --> 10:04.007
Hey, guys. How can I help you?

10:04.050 --> 10:05.399
You want a tuba?

10:05.443 --> 10:08.141
Buy one, get the rest free.

10:08.185 --> 10:11.204
Uh, we're actually looking
for a silver Rolex.

10:11.239 --> 10:13.407
Oh, sick.
There it is, that one right there.

10:13.451 --> 10:15.235
Oh, that's a beautiful piece.

10:15.279 --> 10:18.238
Sure is. Here's your $400.

10:18.282 --> 10:19.805
Uh, it's $1,500 now.

10:19.849 --> 10:22.416
What? We can't afford that.

10:27.660 --> 10:31.077
Sorry. I always wanted to try a tuba.

10:32.426 --> 10:33.819
So let me get this straight.

10:33.863 --> 10:36.387
You gave this poor,

10:36.430 --> 10:39.564
innocent little girl $400 for that watch

10:39.607 --> 10:42.610
and now you're charging
us $1,500 to get it back?

10:42.654 --> 10:44.264
This is a pawnshop, lady.

10:44.308 --> 10:46.614
I sell the items for
more than I buy them.

10:46.658 --> 10:48.399
It's a radical scheme called profit.

10:48.442 --> 10:49.400
Ladies,

10:49.443 --> 10:51.097
if I may.

10:51.141 --> 10:52.969
- Let's cut to the chase.
- Okay.

10:53.012 --> 10:54.927
Name your real price, my man.

10:54.971 --> 10:56.233
$1,500, my man.

10:56.276 --> 10:57.408
Oh.

10:57.451 --> 11:00.324
You want to dance? Let's dance.

11:00.367 --> 11:02.674
We'll give you $500.

11:02.717 --> 11:04.067
How 'bout $1,500?

11:04.110 --> 11:06.678
Oh! Oh. See, now I see
what you're trying to do.

11:06.721 --> 11:08.162
All right, look, do-si-do.

11:08.506 --> 11:10.595
$650 or we walk.

11:10.638 --> 11:13.903
How 'bout you walk to that
ATM and get me $1,500?

11:15.643 --> 11:17.907
This guy's a really good dancer.

11:19.473 --> 11:21.606
No. No! No!

11:21.649 --> 11:23.608
Get out!

11:25.436 --> 11:27.220
Now how are we gonna get the watch back?

11:27.264 --> 11:28.918
Come on, Shannon.

11:28.961 --> 11:31.964
We know how to get the watch back.

11:35.576 --> 11:37.187
Damn it.

11:37.906 --> 11:42.061
I thought you were Uber
Eats bringing me my Big Mac.

11:42.105 --> 11:43.584
Dad, I need your help.

11:43.628 --> 11:46.544
And I need yours.
That guy you live with keeps texting me.

11:46.587 --> 11:48.720
He wants to get together and talk.

11:48.763 --> 11:51.810
It's like I'm in an episode
of Sex and the City.

11:53.856 --> 11:56.467
That guy is my fiancé.

11:56.510 --> 11:57.947
And he's downstairs with Shannon.

11:57.990 --> 11:59.557
So I'm gonna get straight to the point,

11:59.600 --> 12:01.602
because the pawnshop closes in an hour.

12:01.646 --> 12:03.041
Pawnshop? What happened?

12:03.087 --> 12:05.345
Shannon stole something
from Nick's parents

12:05.389 --> 12:08.348
- and then pawned it.
- She did?

12:09.393 --> 12:12.700
I feel like you want me to
have a problem with that.

12:12.744 --> 12:15.262
I just need you to fix it, okay?

12:15.347 --> 12:19.011
The owner is being
a real scumbag, and...

12:19.055 --> 12:21.100
How do I put this nicely?

12:21.144 --> 12:24.103
We need an even bigger scumbag.

12:24.147 --> 12:26.714
Look, I'm flattered.

12:26.758 --> 12:29.195
But shaking people down
for money is one thing.

12:29.239 --> 12:33.547
Doing it for my daughter,
that just... feels wrong.

12:33.591 --> 12:35.969
Fine, Dad. Have it your way.

12:36.328 --> 12:38.509
Where did you get this
picture of us from the beach?

12:38.588 --> 12:40.264
Oh, that was photoshopped
from one of the pictures

12:40.341 --> 12:41.586
we took at your place.

12:42.154 --> 12:44.515
One of the hookers in lockup did it.

12:45.288 --> 12:48.388
She's studying design
at the Art Institute.

12:48.432 --> 12:51.348
A lot of 'em are. It's weird.

12:51.391 --> 12:52.958
Yeah, well,

12:53.002 --> 12:55.613
it sure would be a shame
if the IRS found out

12:55.656 --> 12:59.182
that I haven't been living here for
the last ten years like you claim.

12:59.225 --> 13:02.054
Are you trying to blackmail me?

13:02.098 --> 13:03.316
Please.

13:03.360 --> 13:05.753
Blackmailing people is awful.

13:05.797 --> 13:08.147
But doing it to my own dad?

13:08.191 --> 13:11.150
That just feels right.

13:14.284 --> 13:16.416
Dad, would you slow down?

13:16.460 --> 13:18.244
The faster I go, the safer you are.

13:18.288 --> 13:20.333
I slow down, I get distracted.

13:21.769 --> 13:23.380
Like by that hot blur over there.

13:23.423 --> 13:24.598
Hey, darlin'!

13:26.644 --> 13:28.254
So, Freddy, I was thinking that, uh,

13:28.298 --> 13:30.343
maybe later we can
get together and talk.

13:30.387 --> 13:32.389
We're together now. Talk.

13:32.432 --> 13:34.260
Nick, just drop it.

13:34.304 --> 13:35.958
Look, I just never got a chance

13:36.001 --> 13:37.568
to talk to you before
I proposed to Clem.

13:37.611 --> 13:39.526
Are you trying to ask me for
my daughter's hand in marriage?

13:39.570 --> 13:41.528
Yes. Yes.
And I'd appreciate your blessing.

13:41.572 --> 13:42.747
It'd mean a lot to me...

13:45.010 --> 13:46.925
It's showtime.

13:50.146 --> 13:51.277
Wow, Nick.

13:51.321 --> 13:53.410
Swing and a miss.

13:53.453 --> 13:55.629
Your dad is really hard to connect with.

13:55.938 --> 13:57.457
You want to connect with him?

13:57.501 --> 14:00.634
Get a job as a cocktail
waitress at a bowling alley.

14:00.678 --> 14:03.507
Dude, why you got to slam my mom?

14:05.639 --> 14:08.512
Look, man, I know you're just
trying to make a buck here,

14:08.555 --> 14:12.603
but I also know that everything
in this place is stolen.

14:12.646 --> 14:14.735
Except for the tubas.

14:16.128 --> 14:20.263
But I'm willing to look the other
way if you help me out on the watch.

14:20.306 --> 14:21.873
I don't know what's
stolen and what isn't.

14:21.916 --> 14:23.440
I'm just an honest businessman

14:23.483 --> 14:26.660
who exploits people when
they're at their most desperate.

14:27.870 --> 14:29.446
So if you want this watch,

14:29.489 --> 14:31.535
it'll cost you $1,500.

14:31.578 --> 14:34.973
So there's nothing I could
say that'll change your mind?

14:35.017 --> 14:38.063
Only the words, "Here's $1,500."

14:40.935 --> 14:43.721
- Well, I gave it a shot, yeah?
- Right.

14:43.764 --> 14:46.376
Don't get me wrong.
I know your dad is far from perfect.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.334
But he showed up for you guys today.

14:48.378 --> 14:50.858
Deep down, I think he's a good guy.

14:54.906 --> 14:56.342
Give the watch to my daughter!

14:56.386 --> 14:57.952
Now!

14:57.996 --> 14:59.780
Open the window, pumpkin.

15:00.194 --> 15:02.435
Oh, oh, oh!

15:05.395 --> 15:07.571
Thank you.

15:07.614 --> 15:09.573
Now say you're sorry.

15:09.616 --> 15:12.184
I'm sorry.

15:13.490 --> 15:16.449
So, who's buying me a Big Mac?

15:21.578 --> 15:23.918
Okay, so you guys
are good with the plan?

15:23.962 --> 15:26.051
It's not a plan. We're just gonna

15:26.094 --> 15:29.533
hide the watch in the couch and
then pretend that we found it.

15:29.576 --> 15:33.101
Okay, yes, it's not Ocean's Eleven,
but it is a plan.

15:33.145 --> 15:34.197
Well, you better not blow this,

15:34.281 --> 15:36.296
because I don't want to be
banished like Cousin Eddie.

15:36.388 --> 15:38.498
I think I got this. Watch this.

15:38.542 --> 15:41.980
"Hey. Wait, is that the... No!"

15:42.878 --> 15:44.504
"Hey, Dad, is this your...

15:44.548 --> 15:46.724
No!"

15:46.767 --> 15:48.073
Pretty good, huh?

15:48.116 --> 15:49.640
No!

15:51.293 --> 15:54.294
So, we're having cameras
installed tomorrow.

15:54.358 --> 15:55.164
Ever since the robbery,

15:55.202 --> 15:57.343
- your mother is shook.
- Mm.

15:57.386 --> 16:00.346
That's the way you use that word,
right, Shannon?

16:00.806 --> 16:03.697
That is correct, sir.

16:04.122 --> 16:06.213
Well, I'm sorry.
I just won't be comfortable

16:06.307 --> 16:08.700
until I know this place is secure.

16:08.744 --> 16:11.529
Well, I'm not gonna be comfortable
walking around naked anymore.

16:11.573 --> 16:13.755
Well, that may be for the best,
sweetheart,

16:13.832 --> 16:15.485
because we have windows.

16:15.542 --> 16:18.710
And every time we go across
the street to that Starbucks,

16:18.754 --> 16:20.538
we get looks.

16:22.540 --> 16:24.847
Oh, God, we do.

16:25.755 --> 16:28.459
I'm gonna get dinner ready.

16:30.281 --> 16:32.376
Uh, hey, Dad,
aren't you gonna go help Mom?

16:32.420 --> 16:33.595
Wasn't planning on it.

16:34.813 --> 16:36.467
Walt,

16:36.511 --> 16:38.643
are these chips organic?

16:38.687 --> 16:39.818
I don't know.

16:39.862 --> 16:41.385
Would you mind checking? Because...

16:41.429 --> 16:42.560
I read recently that,

16:42.604 --> 16:44.301
if you're gonna eat junk food,

16:44.345 --> 16:45.998
it really should be organic.

16:46.042 --> 16:48.262
Because of, you know...

16:48.305 --> 16:50.481
global warming.

16:51.569 --> 16:53.397
I never heard that. Have you guys?

16:53.441 --> 16:54.572
- Oh, huge. Huge!
- Oh, it's a big thing.

16:54.616 --> 16:56.748
Yeah.

16:56.792 --> 16:58.489
Would you go make sure?

16:58.533 --> 17:01.187
You know, for... the planet.

17:07.897 --> 17:09.718
Okay, he's gone. Do it now.

17:09.761 --> 17:11.546
- I can't.
- Why not?

17:11.589 --> 17:12.851
I don't think I can pull this off.

17:12.895 --> 17:14.592
I just realized I've
never lied to my parents.

17:14.636 --> 17:17.203
What? You've never lied
to your parents before?

17:17.247 --> 17:19.204
Clem, who are you marrying?

17:19.249 --> 17:21.598
Fine, throw it to me. I'll do it.

17:21.643 --> 17:23.563
They're organic!

17:26.638 --> 17:28.171
I love this dip.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.000
And I love the fact that
we're doing our part

17:31.043 --> 17:33.263
to save the environment.

17:33.307 --> 17:34.786
Dad! Don't eat that.

17:34.830 --> 17:36.005
Wh-Why not?

17:37.102 --> 17:39.356
Uh, because...

17:39.400 --> 17:41.184
you're fat.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.954
There, I said it. I said it.

17:46.068 --> 17:48.583
Fat? What do you mean, fat? I'm not fat.

17:48.626 --> 17:50.715
Clem, do I look fat to you?

17:51.977 --> 17:54.023
I just think he wants
you to look your best

17:54.066 --> 17:55.329
for the wedding photos.

17:55.372 --> 17:58.392
Yeah. I totally agree, because you...

17:59.158 --> 18:02.161
...are a whale.

18:03.467 --> 18:04.729
Dinner's ready, everyone.

18:04.773 --> 18:06.622
Rose, am I not in great shape?

18:06.679 --> 18:07.584
Doesn't matter, Walt.

18:07.611 --> 18:09.908
You shouldn't be walking around naked.

18:10.953 --> 18:12.694
Well, I think I look good.

18:12.737 --> 18:14.086
- No!
- No!

18:20.615 --> 18:22.268
No!

18:23.504 --> 18:25.576
Is that the...

18:25.620 --> 18:27.317
No!

18:31.902 --> 18:34.587
I know, I know.
You guys have been so cool to me,

18:34.631 --> 18:36.546
and the last thing I ever
wanted to do was hurt you.

18:36.589 --> 18:37.721
But you did, Shannon.

18:37.764 --> 18:39.549
And I think what hurts the most

18:39.592 --> 18:43.248
is we welcomed you into
our home and trusted you.

18:43.291 --> 18:47.470
I think what hurts the most is
the gratuitous body shaming.

18:49.167 --> 18:51.082
And the trust thing.

18:51.125 --> 18:53.563
Look, I know this is no excuse,

18:53.606 --> 18:56.087
but before my dad potty-trained us,

18:56.130 --> 18:57.523
he taught us how to steal.

18:57.567 --> 19:00.396
He called it "doing number three."

19:02.572 --> 19:04.868
So, you're not gonna banish me?

19:04.903 --> 19:06.053
Banish you?

19:06.097 --> 19:07.838
Yeah. I was worried this whole thing

19:07.881 --> 19:09.927
was gonna turn into a
Cousin Eddie situation.

19:09.970 --> 19:11.711
A what?

19:13.496 --> 19:15.628
Eddie. The cousin that was
banished from this family

19:15.672 --> 19:17.413
because he stole a hundred
bucks from you guys.

19:22.026 --> 19:23.767
You still believe that, Nick?

19:26.461 --> 19:27.945
There is no Cousin Eddie.

19:27.988 --> 19:31.035
We just made him up to keep you
from doing something stupid.

19:32.515 --> 19:34.604
You made him up?

19:34.647 --> 19:36.432
Yes. Whatever we didn't want you to do,

19:36.475 --> 19:37.998
we just said Cousin Eddie did it

19:38.042 --> 19:41.306
and suffered horribly
so you wouldn't do it!

19:41.349 --> 19:43.482
Wait, so Cousin Eddie never jaywalked

19:43.526 --> 19:44.657
and got hit by a truck?

19:46.703 --> 19:48.269
Cousin Eddie never jaywalked,

19:48.313 --> 19:49.488
because he never crossed the street,

19:49.532 --> 19:51.447
because he never existed.

19:54.050 --> 19:55.451
Damn!

19:55.494 --> 19:57.670
Your parents did you dirty, Nicholas.

19:59.542 --> 20:02.327
Excuse me. We're not
finished with you, Ms. Shannon.

20:02.370 --> 20:05.330
Now, I know your father wasn't
exactly the best role model.

20:05.373 --> 20:08.115
But stealing from your family?

20:08.159 --> 20:09.290
No, that's the thing.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.423
Family doesn't mean anything to him.

20:11.467 --> 20:13.904
And it didn't mean
anything to me either.

20:13.947 --> 20:15.819
Until now.

20:15.862 --> 20:17.647
And that's because of you guys.

20:19.170 --> 20:21.694
All of you guys.

20:21.738 --> 20:24.349
Which is why I'm-I'm really,
really sorry.

20:25.698 --> 20:27.570
Aw, Shannon.

20:27.613 --> 20:30.703
Aw, you guys.

20:30.747 --> 20:33.880
I don't want the people in
Starbucks to see me cry.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.363
Honey, they've seen it all.
