WEBVTT

01:19.997 --> 01:22.915
Outside of the world you know...

01:23.083 --> 01:28.671
...there exists the Realm Eternal,
Asgard.

01:28.839 --> 01:32.633
The shining light of the Nine Worlds...

01:32.801 --> 01:36.804
...Asgard is home to the gods...

01:39.516 --> 01:43.102
...all of whom bow down
before the All-Father...

01:44.605 --> 01:46.355
...Odin.

01:47.483 --> 01:50.985
Odin's lifeblood
flows through Asgard...

01:51.153 --> 01:54.030
...and Asgard is Odin.

01:54.198 --> 01:56.365
His power is all...

01:56.533 --> 01:59.535
...and he keeps
the Asgardian realm safe.

01:59.995 --> 02:04.207
But once each winter,
the All-Father must rest...

02:04.374 --> 02:08.169
...and enter the Odinsleep.

02:09.128 --> 02:14.383
While Odin slumbers, his absence
leaves Asgard vulnerable...

02:14.551 --> 02:20.181
...and this is when the wicked
descend upon his kingdom.

02:29.233 --> 02:32.151
Charge!

02:40.661 --> 02:44.121
For seven days,
an onslaught of trolls...

02:44.289 --> 02:47.250
...giants, dark elves and demons...

02:47.417 --> 02:51.087
...seek to take control
of the Nine Worlds.

02:51.255 --> 02:56.259
But they are eternally defeated
by him...

02:57.719 --> 03:04.016
...my arrogant,
oafish brute of a stepbrother...

03:04.184 --> 03:05.685
...Thor.

03:05.686 --> 03:06.018
...Thor.

03:14.111 --> 03:16.696
I don't understand.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.616
Where--? Where am I?

03:29.793 --> 03:31.752
Hear me, human.

03:31.920 --> 03:36.465
You have been brought to Asgard
because in all the universe...

03:36.633 --> 03:40.887
...only you
have ever brought near defeat...

03:41.054 --> 03:43.139
...to the Mighty Thor.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.142
What?

03:46.310 --> 03:48.436
I-- I couldn't.

03:48.604 --> 03:51.147
Not thee, Bruce Banner.

03:51.315 --> 03:54.942
You are but a sniveling, sad creature.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.778
I speak of your other half.

03:57.946 --> 04:00.114
I speak of the Hulk.

04:02.117 --> 04:06.996
There is one day left of the Odinsleep.
The cycle is nearly complete.

04:10.000 --> 04:13.336
As always, the Asgardians
will emerge victorious...

04:13.503 --> 04:15.838
...against the siege of darkness.

04:16.005 --> 04:20.343
My brother will seek peace,
and then....

04:20.510 --> 04:24.013
Then I shall destroy him.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.612
Verily, ye must say...

04:39.780 --> 04:43.658
...that went far better than last winter.

04:43.825 --> 04:45.242
Tell us, Volstagg...

04:45.410 --> 04:47.912
...are you going to dispatch that troll
beneath you...

04:48.080 --> 04:50.289
...or are you saving him for dinner?

04:51.917 --> 04:55.795
That all depends
on how much mead I partake in.

04:55.963 --> 04:57.797
Did my ears deceive me?

04:57.965 --> 05:00.716
Did Hogun the Grim make a joke?

05:00.884 --> 05:03.260
And here we thought
you were still in a foul mood...

05:03.428 --> 05:05.888
...because you didn't get
to slay a frost giant.

05:06.056 --> 05:08.724
I've still slain more than thee, Fandral.

05:08.934 --> 05:12.561
But we shall see
whom the maidens reward more.

05:24.116 --> 05:29.537
In mere hours, the All-Father
will awaken, and then we may rejoice.

05:34.584 --> 05:38.254
The Lady Sif would know
what vexes thee.

05:38.797 --> 05:41.799
Aye, we won the day.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.969
All is well in the realm of Asgard...

05:45.137 --> 05:47.513
...but only until the next Odinsleep.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.766
It is as it has always been.

05:51.518 --> 05:54.437
We must learn
to savor the moments of peace.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.605
And accept the cycle of death?

05:57.024 --> 06:01.027
How many of our brothers and sisters
have fallen to this madness?

06:01.194 --> 06:03.779
Must we be chained
to this eternal struggle?

06:03.947 --> 06:06.782
Be careful what you wish for,
my love...

06:06.950 --> 06:10.953
...for when the cycle does break,
when things do change...

06:11.121 --> 06:13.789
...then comes the end of days...

06:13.957 --> 06:16.459
...then comes Ragnarok.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.046
Perhaps our fates
are not ours to choose.

06:21.673 --> 06:22.840
But come.

06:23.008 --> 06:26.802
Let us return to my father's palace
and prepare for his awakening.

06:33.101 --> 06:37.063
Please, I'm begging you, don't do this.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.982
I've fought all my life
to keep the Hulk inside.

06:40.484 --> 06:44.445
You don't know the destruction
he can cause.

06:45.947 --> 06:47.656
Don't know?

06:47.824 --> 06:52.244
You fool. I'm counting on it.

06:52.412 --> 06:55.831
Look at you, so weak.

06:55.999 --> 06:58.501
Were it not for you
inside the Hulk's mind...

06:58.668 --> 07:00.669
...suppressing his power...

07:00.837 --> 07:03.464
...he would rule Midgard
with his rage.

07:03.632 --> 07:07.343
I won't let him out.
I won't let you do this.

07:07.511 --> 07:09.845
You won't let me?

07:10.347 --> 07:13.265
How amusing you mortals are.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.018
Let me see if I recall correctly.

07:16.186 --> 07:20.147
It is anger that unleashes the beast.

07:29.533 --> 07:33.536
I seem to have forgotten the frailty
of mortals.

07:33.703 --> 07:38.040
Look, Amora,
I do believe he's going to weep.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.583
No.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.211
It's impossible.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.810
Now.

09:51.132 --> 09:55.427
And so begins the end of Thor.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.814
Well, what think thee, Balder?

10:06.982 --> 10:10.192
One last troll
with dreams of conquest?

10:12.320 --> 10:13.487
Perhaps.

10:20.203 --> 10:22.288
Come, Hogun, Fandral...

10:22.455 --> 10:27.543
...let us give unto this scoundrel
the gift of battle.

11:05.415 --> 11:09.209
Oh, the creature's power
is incredible.

11:09.377 --> 11:10.753
Take care, Loki.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.880
My spell bonds you to the creature...

11:13.048 --> 11:17.801
...and while you are master to it,
I can feel him fighting you.

11:17.969 --> 11:21.597
You have to listen to me.
It can't be controlled.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.849
Do not try my patience, worm...

11:24.017 --> 11:26.935
...lest I turn my attentions to thee.

12:22.575 --> 12:26.578
You are no troll, monster.

12:41.594 --> 12:45.180
'Tis Balder's horn,
but this is not right.

12:45.348 --> 12:47.683
Asgard's enemies are all defeated.

12:47.851 --> 12:50.978
And yet the alarm has sounded.

12:51.146 --> 12:53.605
Stay at Odin's side.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.483
Should I fail to meet this threat,
you must protect him.

13:05.702 --> 13:09.872
But if Thor should fall,
what hope has Asgard?

13:19.757 --> 13:23.719
You will have to kill me, monster...

13:23.887 --> 13:26.472
...for I shall not yield.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.168
Thor, the creature...

13:56.336 --> 13:59.421
...like nothing I have ever seen.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.423
Aye, my friend.

14:01.591 --> 14:05.427
This is no immortal evil
that we face now.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.596
The Hulk has come to Asgard.

14:20.276 --> 14:24.446
Dr. Banner,
can you hear me inside the beast?

14:28.785 --> 14:30.035
Why have you come here?

14:30.203 --> 14:34.289
Why, to kill you, of course,
dear stepbrother.

14:34.457 --> 14:36.333
Loki?

14:41.756 --> 14:44.633
I have waited an eternity for this.

14:44.801 --> 14:48.136
To crush you with my bare hands.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.639
To match your might.

14:50.807 --> 14:54.017
To feel your life fade away...

14:54.185 --> 14:57.396
...as my hands
wrap around your throat.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.824
Never!

16:08.843 --> 16:12.512
Come to your new master, Mjolnir...

16:12.680 --> 16:15.223
...and let us smite my stepbrother...

16:15.391 --> 16:19.019
...for there are none stronger
than Loki now.

16:29.113 --> 16:32.032
Rise, cursed hammer.

16:32.200 --> 16:35.744
Loki, enough.
Your own rage fuels the beast.

16:35.912 --> 16:37.913
I can feel the spell breaking.

16:38.081 --> 16:43.752
I will have this hammer!

16:54.430 --> 16:58.642
Nay, you will have its thunder.

17:13.532 --> 17:16.952
For Odin. For Asgard!

17:31.426 --> 17:33.301
The monster...

17:33.469 --> 17:35.512
...it is rage incarnate.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.889
It has shattered the spell.

17:39.642 --> 17:42.477
The Hulk is free.

17:52.947 --> 17:54.948
Will thou yield, Loki?

18:16.387 --> 18:20.015
Truly, this is the best of both worlds.

18:20.183 --> 18:24.144
I need not control the beast
to enjoy its wrath.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.354
Goodbye, brother.

18:26.773 --> 18:29.816
This.... This is not what I wanted.

18:32.361 --> 18:34.863
There's no going back, Amora.

18:35.031 --> 18:39.493
After all,
if not for your black, broken heart...

18:39.660 --> 18:42.579
...none of this
would have been possible.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.168
You don't know what you've done.

18:48.336 --> 18:53.006
With no one to reign the Hulk in,
he'll tear down your entire world.

18:54.550 --> 18:56.885
I find your prattling useless, mortal...

18:57.053 --> 18:59.554
...just as you are now useless to me.

19:56.237 --> 19:57.445
For Odin.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.115
For Asgard.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.009
Thor.

21:15.900 --> 21:17.484
Thor.

21:18.277 --> 21:20.862
My love, I....

21:21.322 --> 21:24.282
I was angered
when you chose Sif over me.

21:24.450 --> 21:29.537
I did not--
I wanted thy love, not your death.

21:29.705 --> 21:31.414
Please.

21:31.916 --> 21:34.209
Please come back to me.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.888
-Amora.
-Yes, my love.

21:56.565 --> 22:01.361
Where is Loki?

22:41.902 --> 22:46.573
What is that monster doing?
It travels towards Odin.

22:55.458 --> 22:59.085
Loki, I would have words with thee.

22:59.253 --> 23:03.590
No. You were at Hela's door.
I defeated you.

23:09.180 --> 23:13.725
You. You dare cross the god of--

23:31.410 --> 23:35.830
The Hulk will be sent back to Midgard,
and then you will answer to Odin.

23:35.998 --> 23:37.916
Fine, take the creature.

23:38.084 --> 23:39.834
It provided me
with amusement enough...

23:40.002 --> 23:42.212
...seeing it pummel you
nigh unto death.

23:42.379 --> 23:46.091
Loki, you fool. You killed him.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.843
Do you know what you've done?

23:49.220 --> 23:53.056
Because the mortal died here,
Hela claimed his soul.

23:53.224 --> 23:55.850
Without his soul,
I cannot return him to Midgard.

23:56.018 --> 24:01.439
Without Bruce Banner,
the Hulk cannot leave Asgard.

24:33.389 --> 24:39.060
Valkyries, warriors,
your seats in Valhalla are promised.

24:39.228 --> 24:43.398
Protect Odin with your lives.

24:43.774 --> 24:45.984
For Asgard!

24:50.656 --> 24:53.575
I saw the beast's eyes, brother.

24:53.742 --> 24:57.871
It will not stop
until all of Asgard is destroyed...

24:58.038 --> 24:59.539
...until Odin is broken.

24:59.707 --> 25:03.710
You have brought a new Ragnarok
down upon us all.

25:04.587 --> 25:07.922
Possible I made a poor choice.

25:12.219 --> 25:17.390
Amora, I need you by Odin's side.
Protect him along with Lady Sif.

25:19.393 --> 25:21.269
As you wish.

25:25.858 --> 25:31.571
Loki, you will send whatever dark
forces you have left to battle the Hulk.

25:31.739 --> 25:36.451
Then you and I,
we go unto Hel this day.

25:51.175 --> 25:53.801
Rest your weapon, shield maiden.

25:53.969 --> 25:56.930
I have come to aid thee
in Odin's defense...

25:57.097 --> 25:58.640
...at Thor's request.

25:58.807 --> 26:03.853
His request, you say?
More likely his penance, witch.

26:04.021 --> 26:06.481
No doubt he saw your hand
in this attack.

26:08.484 --> 26:12.654
A punishment more cruel
than you can imagine, cow.

26:39.807 --> 26:44.018
Loki, the god of mischief,
bids you death, mortal creature.

26:50.025 --> 26:53.695
Long have I wished
never to see this realm.

27:05.666 --> 27:11.379
I always forget what a busy time
the Odinsleep is for my daughter.

27:11.547 --> 27:14.215
Dost thou see any
newly arrived friends here, brother?

27:14.383 --> 27:17.468
Have a care, Loki, lest ye stay here.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.899
Where am I?

27:55.215 --> 27:59.052
No. This doesn't make any sense.

28:01.430 --> 28:02.972
Bruce?

28:03.140 --> 28:05.016
Are you okay?

28:05.184 --> 28:06.768
Betty?

28:07.436 --> 28:09.103
I thought....

28:09.521 --> 28:11.439
I don't understand.

28:11.607 --> 28:15.860
-I was alone, and then--
-You're not alone, Bruce.

28:17.071 --> 28:18.112
Not anymore.

28:21.784 --> 28:23.743
Daddy.

28:27.915 --> 28:29.457
Come play with me.

28:47.393 --> 28:50.269
Hail Hela, goddess of the dead.

28:50.437 --> 28:52.897
We seek an audience.

28:56.985 --> 29:01.948
The sons of Odin risk much
entering my realm.

29:02.491 --> 29:05.952
The Nine Worlds of Asgard
are in great peril, mistress...

29:06.120 --> 29:08.287
...including Hel and Niflheim.

29:08.455 --> 29:11.833
A new Ragnarok is upon us,
and we need your help.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.502
We need Bruce Banner.

29:19.550 --> 29:23.678
The mortal's soul is mine, Asgardian...

29:23.846 --> 29:26.889
...as yours nearly was this very day...

29:27.057 --> 29:29.183
...and may well be again.

29:29.351 --> 29:32.311
You would risk everything
for the sake of one soul?

29:32.479 --> 29:35.648
Just as you would, Odinson.

29:36.859 --> 29:41.612
But you do not have one soul,
daughter, you have half a soul.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.531
You have Bruce Banner.

29:43.699 --> 29:46.826
You need the Hulk
to complete your prize.

30:31.371 --> 30:35.124
-Are you all right?
-I feel....

30:35.709 --> 30:37.793
I feel great.

30:40.422 --> 30:42.924
I can't imagine anything better.

30:47.221 --> 30:49.305
Bruce Banner.

31:03.570 --> 31:06.531
Wake from this dream.

31:11.161 --> 31:12.703
Betty?

31:13.580 --> 31:16.874
Betty? Where are you?

31:19.253 --> 31:23.130
The world of the living
has need of you.

31:26.969 --> 31:29.845
Who are you?
What do you want with me?

31:30.013 --> 31:32.181
Not I, he.

31:32.349 --> 31:36.477
Friend Banner,
for the sake of all of Asgard...

31:36.645 --> 31:38.813
...you must become the Hulk
once more.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.316
Betty.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.319
Where's...?

31:47.531 --> 31:48.823
No.

31:50.409 --> 31:52.076
No!

32:41.877 --> 32:46.130
No. No, you can't ask me to do that.

32:46.298 --> 32:49.216
I finally had peace.

32:49.384 --> 32:51.719
You don't know what you're asking.

32:51.887 --> 32:56.474
Your time in Hel certainly has not
made you less of a worm, mortal.

33:27.839 --> 33:32.259
Bruce Banner,
I know thee to be a man of honor.

33:32.427 --> 33:34.178
I know thee to be a hero.

33:34.346 --> 33:38.432
The lives at stake are not
your concern, not even human...

33:38.600 --> 33:40.601
...but I ask you anyway.

33:40.769 --> 33:42.520
Be that hero now.

33:47.025 --> 33:48.567
No.

33:49.069 --> 33:50.111
I can't.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.612
Die, beast.

34:02.416 --> 34:05.418
The Hulk's soul is rightfully yours,
daughter.

34:05.585 --> 34:08.379
Take it. Bring the Hulk to Hel.

34:08.755 --> 34:13.717
Merge the two halves of his soul
and claim him.

34:28.942 --> 34:30.860
Bruce Banner...

34:31.027 --> 34:35.406
... I will not force you
to forsake the rewards of the afterlife.

34:35.574 --> 34:40.494
-But you must be whole.
-No. I won't.

34:40.661 --> 34:43.496
You don't understand.

34:54.176 --> 34:55.342
No!

35:39.179 --> 35:41.180
Curse you, Loki...

35:41.348 --> 35:45.226
...for convincing me
to bring this creature to my realm.

35:45.393 --> 35:48.729
Stay thy hand, Hela.
We shall retrieve the Hulk.

35:48.897 --> 35:49.897
We?

35:50.065 --> 35:52.691
The Hulk's fists have addled
your mind, thunderer.

35:53.068 --> 35:57.029
Fight with me, brother, or die alone.

35:57.197 --> 36:00.366
Not much of a threat,
considering we're already in Hel.

36:03.411 --> 36:05.037
Have at thee.

36:59.968 --> 37:03.262
My apologies.
I was enjoying the performance.

37:28.246 --> 37:30.122
Hulk!

37:30.290 --> 37:34.335
Let them go. I'm the one you want.

37:40.133 --> 37:41.842
Come on.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.768
Dr. Banner.

37:59.527 --> 38:04.031
Hulk tired.

38:14.876 --> 38:16.877
You called him weak, Loki...

38:17.045 --> 38:19.546
...but there is more strength
and courage in that man...

38:19.714 --> 38:20.881
...than you will ever know.

38:21.675 --> 38:24.301
This soul is too dangerous
to keep in Hel...

38:24.469 --> 38:27.513
...and too valuable to lose
to Valhalla.

38:28.890 --> 38:31.016
I will return him to Midgard.

38:38.525 --> 38:41.276
Enough of this ridiculousness.

38:41.444 --> 38:44.863
To think that Loki,
prince of darkness...

38:45.031 --> 38:48.742
...should waste his time
with defending Asgard.

38:48.910 --> 38:50.244
Nay, brother.

38:50.412 --> 38:54.248
We leave together,
for you still have much to answer for.

38:54.416 --> 38:57.334
Indeed, you both do...

38:57.752 --> 39:00.838
...for today,
Hela has relinquished a soul...

39:01.006 --> 39:03.924
...and she demands one in exchange.

39:04.092 --> 39:06.802
You may try to take my soul,
death goddess...

39:06.970 --> 39:08.846
...but I will make you fight for it.

39:09.014 --> 39:12.099
And your realm
has suffered much already this day.

39:15.228 --> 39:17.146
You speak the truth.

39:17.313 --> 39:20.607
So I shall take his soul instead.

39:20.775 --> 39:21.900
What?

39:26.156 --> 39:28.574
Thor. Thor!

39:28.742 --> 39:31.618
I helped you. I--

39:35.749 --> 39:38.125
I could fight you for Loki's soul.

39:38.293 --> 39:41.086
-Will you?
-No.

39:41.254 --> 39:45.257
He is my father.
His stay will not be eternal.

39:45.425 --> 39:48.093
But know this, Odinson...

39:48.261 --> 39:54.141
...your soul will be mine,
and I will keep it forever.

39:54.601 --> 39:57.728
Your fate is inescapable.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.646
We shall see.

40:36.601 --> 40:39.770
Thus, the cycle begins anew.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.856
Asgard is safe once again...

40:43.024 --> 40:45.692
...defended to the end by its heroes.

40:45.860 --> 40:49.029
I am proud of each of you
that stand before me.

40:49.197 --> 40:52.950
The day was saved by loyalty
and sacrifice.

40:53.118 --> 40:56.495
We honor those who fought
beside us...

40:57.038 --> 40:58.705
...those who are no longer with us.

41:00.708 --> 41:04.837
And we defy those
who would see us brought to ruin.

41:06.381 --> 41:11.009
And while the rewards of Valhalla
await all of Asgard's heroes...

41:11.177 --> 41:14.555
...this day we honor
a hero of Midgard...

41:14.722 --> 41:20.227
...a mortal who sacrificed everything
for a land not his own.

41:22.147 --> 41:26.525
This day, a human showed the gods
what legends are made of.
