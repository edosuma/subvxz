11:39.611 --> 11:42.484
is one where I guess
Newtonian physics applies,

11:42.484 --> 11:46.096

Annie Millman found her husband,

31:23.838 --> 31:25.709
James, drowned in a bathtub.

31:25.709 --> 31:27.363
At first they thought
it was an accident,

31:27.363 --> 31:29.104
but later they ruled it
as a homicide

31:29.104 --> 31:31.237
and arrested Annie;
later, she confessed,

31:31.237 --> 31:33.500
saying she was hearing voices
in her head.

31:33.500 --> 31:35.415
She asked for the death penalty,
didn't get it,

31:35.415 --> 31:37.156

31:37.156 --> 31:39.332

nobody stayed in the house

31:39.332 --> 31:41.508

31:41.508 --> 31:43.249

moved in

31:43.249 --> 31:44.946

31:44.946 --> 31:47.862
One day Joseph was working
on the roof of the house

31:47.862 --> 31:50.125
and he threw his toolbox
over the edge

31:50.125 --> 31:52.345
and it hit Sue in the head,
killing her.

31:52.345 --> 31:55.304

he just vanished.

swimmer, though,

31:56.740 --> 31:58.612

at the beach every morning.

drowned himself in the ocean.
