'This is the BBC Home Service.
Here is the news.

00:10.440 --> 00:14.670
'A major manhunt has been launched
in Kembleford, Gloucestershire.

00:14.720 --> 00:17.310
'Police are on the hunt
for an escaped prisoner,

00:17.360 --> 00:18.710
'absconded from custody

00:18.760 --> 00:23.030
'whilst being transported from court
to Her Majesty's Prison Gloucester.

00:23.080 --> 00:25.550
'Described as a male in his 30s,

00:25.600 --> 00:30.510
'six feet tall, slim build,
black hair and clean shaven.

00:30.560 --> 00:34.190
'He is wanted for murder and
believed to be dangerous.

00:34.240 --> 00:37.950
'Members of the public are urged to
keep their doors and windows locked

00:38.000 --> 00:42.400
'and anyone seeing him is advised not
to approach but to call the police.'

Father, I need your help.

01:29.160 --> 01:32.760
I was called out to Gallows
Cross in Wenlock woods.

01:33.320 --> 01:34.950
It's the site of the old gibbet

01:35.000 --> 01:37.140
and known suicide spot.

01:39.760 --> 01:43.390
Chaffing to the wrists.
Suggests restraint.

01:43.440 --> 01:47.270
These look like hypodermic
needle marks.

01:47.320 --> 01:49.150
Foul play, sir?

01:49.200 --> 01:53.160
Let's not jump to conclusions until
after the postmortem, DC Albert.

01:58.960 --> 02:02.230
Rather exotic plumage
for Wenlock woods.

02:02.280 --> 02:06.950
Budgerigar. A sky-blue
Opaline is my guess.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.990
Don't tell me I can
now add ornithologist

02:09.039 --> 02:10.830
to your list of expertise.

02:10.880 --> 02:13.870
My grandmother kept parakeets, sir.

02:13.920 --> 02:18.030
Are you familiar with Dr Locard's
principle of exchange?

02:18.080 --> 02:21.070
Violent action constituting
a crime cannot occur...

02:21.120 --> 02:23.310
Without leaving a trace.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.750
I'm well acquainted with the
latest forensic theories,

02:25.800 --> 02:28.110
thank you, Constable.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.230
Bag it up and we'll...

02:30.760 --> 02:34.230
~ Inspector Sullivan.
~ Inspector Trueman.

02:34.280 --> 02:36.830
There's been an error
in communication.

02:36.880 --> 02:39.070
This case was assigned to me.

02:39.120 --> 02:42.110
We were in the area so
the call was diverted.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.310
Like you say, communications error.

02:44.360 --> 02:46.550
I'm here now and can take over.

02:46.600 --> 02:51.030
No need, we've just finished.
Haven't we, DC Albert?

02:51.080 --> 02:52.550
Yes, sir.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.230
'Inspector Clive Trueman.'

02:56.520 --> 02:59.870
Six months secondment from the
British South Africa Police

02:59.920 --> 03:03.710
on the personal recommendation
of the Chief Constable.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.550
No love lost between you two, then.

03:06.600 --> 03:09.550
The dead man was Norman Finlay.

03:09.600 --> 03:11.870
A reporter for the Gloucester News.

03:11.920 --> 03:13.350
According to colleagues,

03:13.400 --> 03:16.030
he'd been boasting about a
big expose he was working on.

03:16.080 --> 03:18.630
He planned on selling it
to a national newspaper.

03:18.680 --> 03:20.950
Fame and fortune beckoned.

03:21.800 --> 03:26.840
Unlikely candidate for a suicide.
What do you think, Albert?

03:30.000 --> 03:33.720
I think I'm up to the challenge
of my first murder investigation.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.990
Norman Finlay's diary has
one entry the day he died.

03:39.040 --> 03:42.270
An appointment at 8pm. With whom?

03:42.320 --> 03:44.710
We need to check all
houses in the vicinity.

03:44.760 --> 03:47.500
I've already taken the liberty, sir.

03:50.600 --> 03:55.870
There are seven properties in a
two mile radius. Two abandoned.

03:55.920 --> 03:59.120
One vacant and for sale,
which leaves four.

04:00.200 --> 04:03.320
Good work. I'll need a list of...

04:07.440 --> 04:09.560
Thank you, Constable.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.470
Anything else I can do, sir?

04:13.520 --> 04:14.910
I'm here to observe and to learn

04:14.960 --> 04:20.750
but if there's any doing to
be done then say the word.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.830
Some tea wouldn't go amiss.

04:22.880 --> 04:25.980
White, no sugar, one
rich tea biscuit, sir.

04:32.160 --> 04:35.310
~ How's the new boy shaping up?
~ Yes...

04:35.360 --> 04:38.800
Still, you can't fault
him for enthusiasm.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.110
Did you want something, Sergeant?

04:43.160 --> 04:45.830
Norman Finlay's postmortem report.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.790
I'm not used to having
my findings questioned.

04:57.840 --> 05:01.280
Just clearing up a few anomalies.

05:03.160 --> 05:06.350
These here look like
hypodermic needle marks,

05:06.400 --> 05:09.140
but there are no sign of any drugs.

05:10.040 --> 05:13.630
Perhaps he went to his doctor
for some blood tests.

05:13.680 --> 05:18.270
And you didn't notice the
chafing to the wrists?

05:18.320 --> 05:20.590
I noticed contact dermatitis,

05:20.640 --> 05:24.400
most likely caused by over starched
shirt cuffs, cheap carbolic.

05:28.280 --> 05:31.950
I hope you're not implying
I'm past it, laddie?

05:32.000 --> 05:33.870
Jock Hamilton's a decent man.

05:33.920 --> 05:37.790
He's a drunk, past his prime,
should've been retired years ago.

05:37.840 --> 05:41.830
I began house-to-house enquiries,
starting with Wenlock Dip,

05:41.880 --> 05:44.270
home of Sir Jeffrey Greensleeves.

05:44.320 --> 05:46.520
Our Justice of the Peace.

05:47.640 --> 05:49.580
~ You know him?
~ Yes.

05:50.760 --> 05:52.350
Not as well as Sid does.

05:52.400 --> 05:54.870
Inspector Sullivan,
Kembleford Police.

05:54.920 --> 05:56.750
Is Sir Jeffrey at home?

05:56.800 --> 05:58.310
He's changing for lunch.

05:58.360 --> 06:01.110
Can I help you? I'm
Harriet Greensleeves.

06:01.160 --> 06:02.430
Afternoon.

06:02.480 --> 06:05.230
We're trying to retrace the
steps of Mr Norman Finlay,

06:05.280 --> 06:07.550
whose body was found on
Monday at Gallows Cross.

06:07.600 --> 06:08.950
How horrible.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.070
That's the third suicide
there in four years.

06:11.120 --> 06:14.990
~ We're treating it as a murder investigation.
~ What DC Albert means

06:15.040 --> 06:18.440
is that we're following up
more than one line of inquiry.

06:19.760 --> 06:22.470
You didn't happen to see Mr
Finlay on the day in question?

06:22.520 --> 06:24.750
Gallows Cross is a mile from here.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.430
Grisly place.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.510
It's where they used
to hang the highwaymen.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.100
Even the dogs won't go near it.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.470
Opaline blue.

06:37.520 --> 06:39.310
~ Mmm.
~ My grandmother had one.

06:39.360 --> 06:40.910
He's called Houdini,

06:40.960 --> 06:43.230
after his skill for escaping the cage

06:43.280 --> 06:46.310
~ and taunting us from
the top of curtain poles.
~ Hmm.

06:46.360 --> 06:49.190
~ Was your husband here on Monday?
~ Yes.

06:49.240 --> 06:52.190
Yes, we dined at eight and
then we played bezique,

06:52.240 --> 06:55.550
so I can say for certain
he didn't see your Mr...

06:55.600 --> 06:56.790
Finlay.

06:56.840 --> 06:58.710
Thank you for your time,
Lady Greensleeves.

06:58.760 --> 07:01.790
Do you mind me asking how
you got that black eye?

07:01.840 --> 07:03.350
Not at all.

07:03.400 --> 07:04.950
Wretched juniper.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.830
~ I was pruning when a branch snapped
back and hit me in the face.
~ Nasty.

07:09.880 --> 07:13.190
And so thorny, you're lucky it
didn't scratch you to ribbons.

07:13.240 --> 07:15.830
May I ask what the blazes
you think you're doing?

07:15.880 --> 07:19.350
~ Sir, I was merely enquiring how...
~ I know what you were enquiring.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.950
And I will thank you not
to interrogate my wife

07:22.000 --> 07:24.670
like some common criminal.
Do you know who I am?

07:24.720 --> 07:27.630
Sir Jeffrey, I do apologise
for DC Albert.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.910
~ He's new to the job.
~ Apologise?

07:29.960 --> 07:31.150
Be informed,

07:31.200 --> 07:33.470
I'm acquainted with
the Chief Constable

07:33.520 --> 07:37.120
and will be letting him know
my feelings in person.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.750
Good day.

07:46.920 --> 07:48.950
I've heard you're a man to watch.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.430
I think you'll find
I can be trusted, sir.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.420
Inspector Sullivan.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.470
Someone's been a naughty boy.

07:55.520 --> 07:59.080
Sir Jeffrey Greensleeves
has lodged a complaint.

08:00.240 --> 08:03.590
~ It was a misunderstanding, sir.
~ Mmm. You bet your boots.

08:03.640 --> 08:07.790
What goes on between a man and his
wife is no business of the police.

08:07.840 --> 08:11.870
Especially when the man is a
very big cheese in this county.

08:11.920 --> 08:15.430
DC Albert was a touch
over zealous, sir.

08:15.480 --> 08:17.750
This is highly embarrassing.

08:17.800 --> 08:20.030
I think it better all round

08:20.080 --> 08:23.270
if you're temporarily
suspended from duty.

08:23.320 --> 08:29.350
~ Suspended? Sir, I...
~ It's a few days. Slap
on the wrist to save face.

08:29.400 --> 08:32.510
I'm sure Trueman here can
step up in your absence.

08:32.559 --> 08:33.870
Sir, I...

08:33.919 --> 08:36.390
.. sir. Pardon the interruption, sir.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.230
At ease, Constable.

08:38.280 --> 08:41.159
I'm finished here.

08:42.320 --> 08:45.150
I hope we can expect you tonight.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.300
There's some people
I'd like you to meet.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.470
The feathers are a match,

08:52.520 --> 08:56.910
which means we can place Norman Finlay
at Greensleeves House the day he died.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.110
I'm off the case...

08:59.160 --> 09:00.790
DC Albert.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.240
Tell it to Inspector Trueman.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.830
Er, we're working on
Locard's principle.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.950
The violent action of a crime
will leave traces of evidence...

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
That isn't evidence.

09:19.680 --> 09:23.270
It's a feather. And
there was no crime.

09:23.320 --> 09:26.550
The postmortem found suicide.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.430
~ But, sir...
~ The case is closed, Constable.

09:29.480 --> 09:35.280
So if you'd like to redirect your
zeal to the statement filing.

10:03.680 --> 10:05.630
Kembleford, 731.

10:05.680 --> 10:07.550
'Sir, it's about the Finlay case.'

10:07.600 --> 10:09.910
Inspector Trueman was
hasty in closing it.

10:09.960 --> 10:13.270
I think Greensleeves had you removed
because we were on to something.

10:13.320 --> 10:16.550
'I re-examined Finlay's clothes
for further trace evidence'

10:16.600 --> 10:19.670
and found something
far more interesting.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.190
'Then I suggest you put it
back where you found it,'

10:22.240 --> 10:25.470
before Inspector Trueman catches
you flouting his orders.

10:25.520 --> 10:26.950
'It's important.'

10:27.000 --> 10:31.870
Remember Finlay's missing expose...

10:31.920 --> 10:33.390
'Good night, sir.

10:33.440 --> 10:35.380
'Enjoy your party.'

10:37.920 --> 10:40.190
Can you meet me in the evidence room?

10:40.240 --> 10:43.440
Please, sir. I think
you'll want to see this.

10:49.640 --> 10:51.150
Albert was right.

10:51.200 --> 10:53.950
Greensleeves had Busby
remove me from the case

10:54.000 --> 10:56.110
because I was on to something.

10:56.160 --> 10:59.470
Trueman wilfully ignored
evidence under his nose.

10:59.520 --> 11:02.190
Jock Hamilton's postmortem
was at best incompetent

11:02.240 --> 11:05.180
~ and at worst, fabrication.
~ Conspiracy.

11:05.840 --> 11:09.080
That was the night of the police
benevolent fundraiser.

11:12.120 --> 11:13.870
The Greensleeves are here.

11:13.920 --> 11:17.160
Please excuse us, I need Father
Brown for moral support.

11:21.440 --> 11:22.840
Harriet.

11:24.160 --> 11:27.430
~ Oh. Oh, goodness, what happened to your eye?
~ Silly...

11:27.480 --> 11:30.350
Oh... And Jeffrey. Just the man, um,

11:30.400 --> 11:31.630
could I have a word

11:31.680 --> 11:34.510
about my chauffeur's court
appearance next week?

11:34.560 --> 11:37.670
Time has barely flown
by since the last one.

11:37.720 --> 11:40.950
If I can borrow our chairlady
to meet our new inspector.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.100
Clive Trueman, on secondment
from Rhodesia.

11:47.400 --> 11:48.510
Er...

11:48.560 --> 11:51.710
Inspector Sullivan was
being quite over zealous

11:51.760 --> 11:54.350
in pressing for a custodial sentence.

11:54.400 --> 11:55.990
I have Sid's word

11:56.040 --> 11:59.270
he was only looking after
the items for a friend.

11:59.320 --> 12:01.520
Isn't that right, Father?

12:04.520 --> 12:09.710
Mr Carter has assured Lady Felicia
that that was the case.

12:09.760 --> 12:11.430
There you are, you see?

12:11.480 --> 12:13.550
The word of a priest.

12:13.600 --> 12:16.230
And you know how difficult
it is to get the staff.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.230
I may even be forced to drive myself.

12:37.680 --> 12:41.110
Help! I need help in here!

12:42.720 --> 12:44.870
Hel-met...

12:44.920 --> 12:46.440
Two.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.840
B34709.

12:51.080 --> 12:54.270
Don't! You'll bleed to death.

12:54.320 --> 12:59.150
B-3-4-7-0-9.

12:59.200 --> 13:00.870
I hid.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.320
I hid...

13:03.920 --> 13:06.320
Trust no-one.

13:25.760 --> 13:27.230
Mrs McCarthy?

13:27.280 --> 13:28.870
The police just telephoned.

13:28.920 --> 13:34.910
A fugitive was seen skulking around the
back of the church not a while back and...

13:34.960 --> 13:37.270
and the place is full of nuns.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.280
Thank you, Mrs M.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.900
He's in there with
you, isn't he, Father?

13:46.120 --> 13:48.710
I'll explain later. For the moment,

13:48.760 --> 13:53.310
could you to hold them off
for as long as you can?

13:53.360 --> 13:54.790
And...

13:54.840 --> 13:57.160
may I borrow your scarf?

14:03.920 --> 14:06.150
Father Brown is hearing confessions.

14:06.200 --> 14:08.590
You can't go stampeding
into the church

14:08.640 --> 14:10.830
in the middle of a holy sacrament.

14:10.880 --> 14:15.200
I trust my men and I can behave
ourselves with suitable decorum.

14:19.880 --> 14:21.430
Please stand aside, madam,

14:21.480 --> 14:24.840
or I'll be forced to conclude
you're hiding something.

14:30.040 --> 14:32.780
Search it, boys, with a tooth comb.

14:36.840 --> 14:39.950
Inspector Trueman, I presume?

14:40.000 --> 14:41.870
I'd like to see in here.

14:41.920 --> 14:43.390
In here

14:43.440 --> 14:47.640
is a penitent under the
seal of the confession.

14:49.880 --> 14:52.080
I beg your pardon, madam.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.430
Nothing here, sir.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.870
Well, as you haven't
found what you wanted,

14:59.920 --> 15:02.190
perhaps I can get on with MY work.

15:02.240 --> 15:04.910
Your reputation precedes you, Father.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.630
All good, I presume.

15:06.680 --> 15:09.390
None of it. According
to Inspector Sullivan,

15:09.440 --> 15:13.080
you're a loose canon with
delusions of grandeur.

15:14.160 --> 15:15.190
Meddlesome,

15:15.240 --> 15:18.310
recklessly foolhardy,
morally dubious,

15:18.360 --> 15:22.150
yet possessed of a certain
tiresome intelligence,

15:22.200 --> 15:24.350
which I won't insult.

15:24.400 --> 15:28.840
So if you were contemplating
interference, be warned.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.560
I will be watching you.

15:44.120 --> 15:45.750
Thank you.

15:45.800 --> 15:49.100
Looks like he hasn't had
a square meal in days.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.720
We came as soon as we could.

15:59.960 --> 16:02.990
Well, here's a moment
I thought I'd never see.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.950
I'm innocent.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.510
That's what they all say.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.300
Thank you, Sid.

16:10.240 --> 16:11.710
Thank you.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.830
The inspector

16:14.880 --> 16:17.840
~ was about to finish his story.
~ Oh...

16:22.760 --> 16:26.750
You blamed Detective Constable
Albert for your suspension.

16:26.800 --> 16:29.670
Did you come back to
have it out with him?

16:29.720 --> 16:30.860
No.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.150
What about the medallion?

16:35.200 --> 16:36.670
Medallion?

16:38.040 --> 16:39.790
In Albert's hand.

16:39.840 --> 16:42.750
He must have torn it from
the neck of the killer.

16:42.800 --> 16:44.510
We found no medallion.

16:44.560 --> 16:47.680
You allege DC Albert was
alive when you found him.

16:48.880 --> 16:52.280
Did he give any clues as to
his killer before he died?

16:54.600 --> 16:56.150
No.

16:56.200 --> 16:58.940
'What did
the medallion look like?'

16:59.360 --> 17:01.310
A bird of some sort.

17:01.360 --> 17:03.390
And letters PM...

17:03.440 --> 17:06.109
~ something V.
~ Per Me Caeci Vident.

17:07.599 --> 17:10.230
"Through me the blind
become sighted."

17:10.280 --> 17:11.710
The Owl of Minerva.

17:11.760 --> 17:14.030
~ That's not good news.
~ No.

17:15.839 --> 17:18.380
It's the seal of The Illuminati.

17:19.119 --> 17:20.310
Illumi-what?

17:20.359 --> 17:24.230
The Enlightened, it's a sort
of offshoot of the Freemasons.

17:24.280 --> 17:28.470
A web of secret societies,
they comprise a social elite.

17:28.520 --> 17:31.950
~ Here In Kembleford?
~ Well, they say they're everywhere,

17:32.000 --> 17:36.470
lurking in the shadows, pulling
the strings and levers of power.

17:36.520 --> 17:40.230
Rumour has it Monty's Great Uncle
Roly was something of the sort.

17:40.280 --> 17:41.950
Not that he ever admitted it.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.740
They guard their identities closely.

17:45.600 --> 17:47.590
Which is why they're so dangerous.

17:47.640 --> 17:49.780
Norman Finlay's expose.

17:52.240 --> 17:54.550
If he planned to unmask
such a group...

17:54.600 --> 17:57.510
Then I believe they would
be prepared to kill

17:57.560 --> 17:59.830
to protect their secrets.

17:59.880 --> 18:03.180
And are powerful enough
to cover their tracks.

18:18.840 --> 18:23.110
.. strangely agitated by the
results of a routine postmortem.

18:23.160 --> 18:26.990
In my professional opinion, he was
showing signs of mental stress.

18:27.040 --> 18:31.390
Inspector Sullivan blamed DC
Albert for his suspension....

18:31.440 --> 18:33.630
Sullivan was kneeling over him,

18:33.680 --> 18:35.790
reeking of whisky,

18:35.840 --> 18:38.380
with his hands around the knife.

18:39.400 --> 18:42.790
It's true there was no
love lost between...

18:42.840 --> 18:45.440
Inspector Sullivan and DC Albert.

18:48.960 --> 18:53.710
Because of the particularly
odious nature of this crime,

18:53.760 --> 18:58.670
the prisoner is remanded in custody
for committal to the Court of Assize

18:58.720 --> 19:00.520
to stand trial...

19:01.240 --> 19:02.910
.. for murder.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.900
~ Name?
~ Rhys Jones.
~ Rhys Jones.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.790
Name?

19:11.840 --> 19:13.190
Sullivan.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.040
<Officer Tindle.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.350
'Was it wise to return to Kembleford?

19:56.400 --> 19:58.430
'How else will I prove my innocence?'

19:58.480 --> 20:00.150
How will you?

20:01.640 --> 20:04.070
Albert's last words.

20:04.120 --> 20:08.350
Helmet two, B34709.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.550
The murderer was German.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.670
Helmut. Hel-mut.

20:13.720 --> 20:17.830
The numbers meant something.
An evidence bag.

20:17.880 --> 20:20.630
I think Albert hid something in
one of them before he was killed.

20:20.680 --> 20:24.110
So your master plan was to break out
of jail only to break back in again.

20:24.160 --> 20:27.100
Father, should you
tell him or shall I?

20:28.040 --> 20:30.670
I suggest a good night's sleep.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.510
We will think of something
in the morning.

20:32.560 --> 20:35.160
"We" will do nothing of the sort.

20:36.200 --> 20:39.150
I'll be on my way in the morning,
as soon as it's safe to leave.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.670
You won't last five minutes.

20:40.720 --> 20:43.830
While I appreciate your sanctuary,
Father, I do not intend to

20:43.880 --> 20:46.190
throw in my lot with you and your

20:46.240 --> 20:49.150
dubious associates.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.550
Him and his dubious associates is all
you've got from where I'm standing.

20:52.600 --> 20:55.800
Which is why I'll take
my chances alone.

21:08.360 --> 21:11.270
Come in, come in. Her
Ladyship has news.

21:11.320 --> 21:14.670
The Governor of Southern Rhodesia
is an old chum, so I rang him

21:14.720 --> 21:17.190
for a lowdown on Inspector Trueman.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.510
Never heard of him.

21:18.560 --> 21:21.270
Nor is there any record of him
in the South Africa Police.

21:21.320 --> 21:23.320
A cuckoo in the nest.

21:24.760 --> 21:26.030
Now...

21:26.960 --> 21:30.110
Yes, I think that will do at a pinch.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.500
I'll just move the buttons.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.350
Our police escort has just left.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.510
They have spotted a
fugitive in Hambleston

21:38.560 --> 21:40.990
and they have chased down
there to collar him.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.580
Bravo, Sid.

21:43.400 --> 21:44.790
You?!

21:44.840 --> 21:46.310
Yeah, that's right.

21:46.360 --> 21:49.070
I took your hat and coat
and put it on a riverbank.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.830
I mean, it won't fool Trueman but
he will be forced to dredge it.

21:51.880 --> 21:54.270
Which will give us breathing
space to find out what

21:54.320 --> 21:57.710
Detective Constable Albert
hid in your evidence room.

21:57.760 --> 22:00.510
And I've done a recce.
One outside window.

22:00.560 --> 22:02.350
Deadbolt lock but no bars.

22:02.400 --> 22:04.550
You might want to do a
review of your security.

22:04.600 --> 22:08.230
It's designed to stop criminals
breaking out, not in.

22:08.280 --> 22:10.550
Ten-minute job.

22:10.600 --> 22:14.160
Unless, of course, you still
think you're "better off alone"?

22:19.320 --> 22:21.510
~ I'm going with him.
~ I think that's it's too risky.

22:21.560 --> 22:24.030
You think I'd let a known felon
with a court case pending

22:24.080 --> 22:26.550
loose in my own evidence room.

22:26.920 --> 22:30.160
Besides the fact you don't
know what you're looking for.

22:48.080 --> 22:49.950
Do you mind?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.670
Trade secrets.

23:24.280 --> 23:25.350
Jock.

23:25.400 --> 23:26.670
Padre!

23:27.520 --> 23:28.920
Join me?

23:31.520 --> 23:33.590
A wee bit early.

23:33.640 --> 23:35.310
Even for you.

23:35.360 --> 23:37.670
So, to what do I owe the honour?

23:37.720 --> 23:42.030
Inspector Sullivan. You testified
that he was of unsound mind.

23:42.080 --> 23:45.150
~ What's it to you?
~ I should have noticed.

23:45.200 --> 23:47.830
Then perhaps I could have prevented
this terrible tragedy.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.030
Don't beat yourself up.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.110
Wouldn't be the first Copper
that tipped over on the job.

23:57.680 --> 23:58.880
Aye?

24:00.280 --> 24:02.550
Aye, right, I'll be there.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.680
I have to sign a body in.

24:07.800 --> 24:09.110
Five minutes.

24:09.160 --> 24:12.100
Help yourself if you
change your mind.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.620
A, B...

24:45.600 --> 24:46.870
808...

24:47.960 --> 24:49.230
029...

24:50.480 --> 24:51.680
709.

24:52.560 --> 24:55.360
Frankie the Fence. I made the arrest.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.550
Well, well. What do we make of these?

25:02.600 --> 25:04.510
Frankie the Fence has size ten feet?

25:04.560 --> 25:06.960
Frankie the Fence is a woman.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.340
Come on. We have not
got time for this.

25:14.760 --> 25:16.430
Put that back.

25:18.560 --> 25:21.830
This evidence will get me six months in
the poke. The way I see it, you owe me.

25:21.880 --> 25:24.670
The debt doesn't extend to
the theft of your evidence.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.950
Says the man holding stolen
evidence in his hands.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.110
The distinction being, I'm innocent
and you were caught fair and square.

25:30.160 --> 25:32.950
~ Put it back!
~ Or what, you'll raise the alarm?

25:33.000 --> 25:36.040
'Open the door, please, Sergeant.
I thought I heard voices.'

25:38.640 --> 25:41.720
No-one signed the key out.
I'll take a look around, sir.

25:54.760 --> 25:56.500
All clear, sir.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.830
'Frank Albert's memorial cards.'

26:01.880 --> 26:04.880
His mother sent them
for the Requiem Mass.

26:05.680 --> 26:08.150
Francois Albert.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.270
Francois "Al-bere."

26:10.320 --> 26:11.670
He was French?

26:11.720 --> 26:13.390
His father is.

26:13.440 --> 26:16.070
They moved to England
at the start of the war

26:16.120 --> 26:19.920
because they thought it would
be safer for the child.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.030
Any success?

26:23.080 --> 26:25.620
That depends on your viewpoint.

26:26.160 --> 26:29.710
These are what Albert hid
before he was killed.

26:29.760 --> 26:30.790
A pair of shoes?

26:30.840 --> 26:34.000
Norman Finlay's shoes. With
something wedged inside.

26:37.480 --> 26:40.910
A left luggage ticket
for a briefcase.

26:40.960 --> 26:42.670
A journalist always keeps copies.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.070
The missing expose?

26:44.120 --> 26:45.310
We'll soon find out.

26:45.360 --> 26:47.900
We will do nothing of the sort.

26:49.080 --> 26:52.950
The contents of that briefcase
have already caused two deaths.

26:53.000 --> 26:56.300
Whatever's in that case
may prove my innocence.

26:58.120 --> 26:59.750
I just need time to think.

26:59.800 --> 27:02.590
Have you forgotten which one
of us is the police officer?

27:02.640 --> 27:05.350
I'll find Albert's killer,
with or without your help.

27:05.400 --> 27:07.920
Sit down, Sid!

27:26.040 --> 27:27.600
Hello? Yes.

27:29.320 --> 27:31.640
Inspector Trueman, please.

28:07.360 --> 28:08.590
Can I have a word, officer?

28:08.640 --> 28:11.680
Of course, sir, come with me to the
station, please. How can I help?

28:48.960 --> 28:51.230
Good of you to come alone.

28:56.080 --> 28:59.360
It's all a bit cloak and dagger.
What's wrong with the pub?

29:00.760 --> 29:02.190
You have dangerous friends

29:02.240 --> 29:06.360
and I hoped for old times' sake we
could be honest with each other.

29:08.920 --> 29:10.190
Go on.

29:16.800 --> 29:20.200
Norman Finlay left it in
the left luggage office.

29:22.760 --> 29:24.760
And I want to trade.

29:32.440 --> 29:34.380
Did you come alone?

29:35.600 --> 29:38.700
I was about to ask
you the same question.

29:40.480 --> 29:42.830
Please don't scream.
I won't harm you.

29:42.880 --> 29:44.030
Inspector Sullivan.

29:44.080 --> 29:46.320
I'm not... I'm innocent.

29:47.560 --> 29:49.190
You can't stay here.

29:49.240 --> 29:52.240
Follow me, I'll take
you somewhere safe.

30:00.600 --> 30:03.830
It's probably a deer,
the speed it ran off at.

30:03.880 --> 30:08.680
Good. Neither of us would want
this conversation to be overheard.

30:14.280 --> 30:17.280
What do you know about
sodium pentothal?

30:22.840 --> 30:24.840
It's an anaesthetic.

30:26.280 --> 30:29.480
A curious area of interest
for a pathologist.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.190
You read my files.

30:33.480 --> 30:34.680
Yes.

30:35.600 --> 30:37.600
It was on your desk.

30:39.280 --> 30:41.630
The Russian Secret
Police used to call it

30:41.680 --> 30:44.350
"the remedy that loosens tongues."

30:45.840 --> 30:47.440
Truth serum.

30:48.560 --> 30:51.430
Norman Finlay had
something you wanted.

30:51.480 --> 30:54.020
But he wouldn't give it to you.

30:59.000 --> 31:02.280
I calculated the doses exactly.

31:03.400 --> 31:05.150
Enough to make him talk,

31:05.200 --> 31:07.140
not enough to kill.

31:07.840 --> 31:11.280
That's what happens when you
let a drunk loose on the living.

31:13.160 --> 31:15.230
I didn't hurt the boy.

31:16.240 --> 31:17.600
I know.

31:20.560 --> 31:21.900
I know.

31:24.080 --> 31:26.750
His last words were
in his mother tongue.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.510
He was French.

31:28.560 --> 31:31.280
Elle m'a tue.

31:33.400 --> 31:35.140
"Elle m'a tue."

31:35.800 --> 31:37.470
She killed me.

31:40.120 --> 31:44.160
Frank Albert's killer was a woman.

31:47.000 --> 31:48.030
Where are we going?

31:48.080 --> 31:50.870
An old poachers' cottage.
You'll be safe there.

31:50.920 --> 31:52.660
Safe from whom?

31:53.280 --> 31:55.790
You know who killed Albert
and Norman Finlay?

31:55.840 --> 31:57.590
It's better you don't ask.

31:57.640 --> 31:59.630
I've been framed for a
murder I didn't commit.

31:59.680 --> 32:02.470
You got embroiled with
the wrong people.

32:02.520 --> 32:06.020
For your own sake, the
less you know, the better.

32:08.120 --> 32:11.720
Wait a minute, we're heading
back to Gallows Cross.

32:12.960 --> 32:15.750
These woods are like warrens.
They're deceptive.

32:15.800 --> 32:19.760
We're heading directly northwest,
we've circled back on ourselves.

32:21.040 --> 32:23.070
You were warned off.

32:23.120 --> 32:26.400
You were quite exasperating
in your persistence.

32:28.200 --> 32:29.870
Where is this?

32:31.640 --> 32:34.180
The end of the road, Inspector.

32:36.760 --> 32:39.800
Albert had the makings
of a good detective.

32:41.280 --> 32:44.320
It's important, remember
Finlay's missing expose.

32:46.920 --> 32:50.430
Night, Constable. Don't burn
the candle at both ends.

32:50.480 --> 32:53.150
Good night, sir. Enjoy your party.

32:55.120 --> 32:56.990
We have a problem.

32:59.080 --> 33:00.830
'Can you meet me in
the evidence room?

33:00.880 --> 33:04.180
'Please, sir, I think you'll
want to see this.'

33:06.080 --> 33:07.280
Sir?

33:28.040 --> 33:30.830
You're cleverer than
you look, Father.

33:30.880 --> 33:33.030
Look what I found.

33:33.080 --> 33:35.270
I take it he wasn't part of the plan?

33:35.320 --> 33:36.710
You gave me your word.

33:36.760 --> 33:38.960
He doesn't answer to you.

33:39.320 --> 33:43.230
If it's any consolation,
I admired the boy.

33:43.280 --> 33:46.440
He had tenacity and
he went down fighting.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.310
Just like Norman Finlay.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.430
You lured him to your house.

33:52.480 --> 33:54.870
He had something that
didn't belong to him.

33:54.920 --> 33:56.790
And now I have it.

33:58.840 --> 34:00.320
Sit.

34:09.199 --> 34:10.230
How did you get here?

34:10.280 --> 34:12.350
You double crossing...

34:12.400 --> 34:14.520
I was protecting you.

34:17.600 --> 34:20.630
Take it and let us go.

34:20.679 --> 34:23.469
Then you'll have no more
lives on your conscience.

34:23.520 --> 34:27.389
Your lives are insignificant. There
are matters of more import at stake.

34:27.440 --> 34:29.710
Oh, yes.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.550
Your new world order.

34:31.600 --> 34:35.239
~ Father.
~ It's more omnipotent than
your church will ever be.

34:37.360 --> 34:39.429
I'm going to get rope.

34:40.920 --> 34:43.070
I'm not going to do anything.

34:43.120 --> 34:49.310
You are going to shoot the priest
and then, tortured with remorse,

34:49.360 --> 34:51.760
you will take your own life.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.679
If they move, kill them.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.870
On my count...

35:03.760 --> 35:06.390
.. let's make a run for the bikes.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.110
Are you insane? He'll shoot us.

35:09.160 --> 35:12.070
I'm staking my life on
the fact that he won't.

35:12.120 --> 35:14.310
You're staking both our lives.

35:14.360 --> 35:16.700
Have you got a better idea?

35:22.800 --> 35:24.200
Three...

35:26.120 --> 35:27.390
Two...

35:28.080 --> 35:29.350
One.

35:29.400 --> 35:32.510
Stop! Stop, I'll shoot!

35:32.560 --> 35:35.430
I'm counting the ways this
can go wrong, Father!

35:35.480 --> 35:37.830
I said I'll shoot!

35:37.880 --> 35:39.420
Shoot them!

35:42.080 --> 35:44.720
Idiot... I said shoot them!

35:50.400 --> 35:53.950
You never fail to disappoint, Jock.
They're headed for the road.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.870
We'll get the car and cut them off.

35:55.920 --> 35:57.790
What are you waiting for?

35:57.840 --> 35:59.510
Gone too far.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.700
Enough.

36:05.040 --> 36:06.790
Very well.

36:06.840 --> 36:08.510
If you say so.

36:10.480 --> 36:13.670
~ How did you know he wouldn't shoot?
~ Because Jock Hamilton's not a killer.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.670
You just said he killed
Norman Finlay.

36:15.720 --> 36:18.150
Correction, he's not a murderer.

36:18.200 --> 36:21.150
Harriet Greensleeves,
on the other hand...

36:21.200 --> 36:23.550
You worked all this out
and kept it to yourself?

36:23.600 --> 36:26.070
It wasn't just your safety
I had to consider.

36:26.120 --> 36:28.150
We need to get off the road, Father.

36:28.200 --> 36:31.140
~ Not much further now.
~ Further? To what?

36:41.560 --> 36:45.070
Just keep calm and
let me do the talking.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.830
Did the Chief Constable send you?

36:46.880 --> 36:48.350
Yes Ma'am.

36:50.160 --> 36:52.630
There were some complications.

36:55.240 --> 36:57.310
Don't be a fool.

36:57.360 --> 36:58.710
He hasn't got the..

36:58.760 --> 37:01.760
The next word you say
will be your last.

37:02.760 --> 37:05.630
If you're such an expert
in human behaviour, Father,

37:05.680 --> 37:08.080
then you know I will do this.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.390
No, you won't.

37:11.440 --> 37:14.710
One, just one reason why not?

37:14.760 --> 37:16.960
Because you're innocent.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.800
If you pull that trigger, you
will be as guilty as she is.

37:39.400 --> 37:42.110
The Chief Constable says
you're trustworthy.

37:42.160 --> 37:43.760
I am, Ma'am.

37:45.080 --> 37:47.820
So, you know what needs to be done.

37:47.960 --> 37:49.230
Ma'am.

37:57.320 --> 37:59.070
Cover me if she tries anything.

37:59.120 --> 38:02.790
Harriet Greensleeves, I'm arresting
you for the murder of DC Frank Albert.

38:02.840 --> 38:05.590
You are not obliged to say
anything unless you wish to do

38:05.640 --> 38:08.470
so but what you say may
be given in evidence.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.520
You have no evidence.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.070
Yes, we have.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.150
Um...

38:30.600 --> 38:33.700
Is someone going to tell
me what's going on?

38:41.240 --> 38:45.280
'I'm not going to do anything. You
are going to shoot the priest...'

38:48.120 --> 38:50.590
We've had our eye on
Chief Constable Busby

38:50.640 --> 38:54.630
and his cronies for some time but
we didn't have a shred of proof.

38:54.680 --> 38:56.150
"We" being?

38:56.200 --> 38:57.990
A division of Special Branch,

38:58.040 --> 39:02.070
specialising in the activities
of groups such as these.

39:02.120 --> 39:04.230
You let them frame me for murder.

39:04.280 --> 39:06.670
My orders were to infiltrate.

39:06.720 --> 39:09.430
Norman Finlay's murder threatened
to throw the whole mission

39:09.480 --> 39:12.190
and I couldn't risk blowing my cover.

39:12.240 --> 39:14.510
On the subject of which...

39:15.240 --> 39:18.640
.. you still haven't told
me how you managed it?

39:19.760 --> 39:21.960
I beg your pardon, ma'am.

39:23.520 --> 39:25.390
Nothing here, sir.

39:25.960 --> 39:30.830
So, I was intrigued as to
why you found your quarry

39:30.880 --> 39:32.880
and then let him go.

39:33.520 --> 39:35.860
And your alias. "True man."

39:36.520 --> 39:38.720
Why label yourself so...

39:39.560 --> 39:41.830
.. if it wasn't the truth?

39:42.120 --> 39:45.720
I see I'll have to choose
more carefully in future.

39:46.040 --> 39:48.310
And you didn't see fit
to share this with me?

39:48.360 --> 39:50.790
I thought you might
do something reckless.

39:50.840 --> 39:52.670
You did do something reckless.

39:52.720 --> 39:55.750
And I couldn't risk you seeing
the contents of the briefcase.

39:55.800 --> 39:56.870
Which was?

39:56.920 --> 40:01.710
Diaries, passed to Norman Finlay
by a defector from the group who

40:01.760 --> 40:04.190
became disenchanted
with their methods.

40:04.240 --> 40:09.430
Naming names. Records of conspiracy,
bribery and corruption.

40:09.480 --> 40:10.790
You switched the briefcases.

40:10.840 --> 40:13.510
My only hope was to get a confession.

40:13.560 --> 40:16.840
Father Brown thought
Hamilton might oblige.

40:18.160 --> 40:19.630
Poor Jock.

40:20.360 --> 40:22.630
Requiescat in pace.

40:22.680 --> 40:24.950
The plan was to intercept him

40:25.000 --> 40:28.110
with the evidence on his
way back to Kembleford.

40:28.160 --> 40:29.430
And the real case?

40:29.480 --> 40:30.710
Is in the proper hands.

40:30.760 --> 40:33.960
You saw nothing so need
fear no repercussion.

40:36.880 --> 40:39.420
The same can't be said for you.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.600
Don't worry about me.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.740
I don't even exist.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.480
We're in a meeting, Sergeant.

40:49.040 --> 40:50.840
But, Sergeant...

40:52.600 --> 40:55.270
If you could see your
way to three teas.

40:55.320 --> 40:59.040
Yes, sir. It's good
to have you back, sir.

41:00.840 --> 41:03.380
It's good to be back, Sergeant.

41:08.640 --> 41:13.040
DC Frank Albert was intelligent...

41:14.440 --> 41:17.110
.. tenacious,

41:17.160 --> 41:20.260
dogged in the pursuit
of truth and justice.

41:23.800 --> 41:28.230
That he was cut down before
his prime will forever be

41:28.280 --> 41:31.220
a loss to the forces
of law and order.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.400
He was an officer...

41:36.400 --> 41:37.870
.. man...

41:40.080 --> 41:42.350
.. and son to be proud of.

41:56.680 --> 41:59.230
I thought you'd like to know.

41:59.280 --> 42:02.790
Sir Jeffrey Greensleeves has been
charged with accessory to murder

42:02.840 --> 42:06.560
and Chief Constable Busby with
perverting the cause of justice.

42:08.480 --> 42:10.670
And Inspector Trueman?

42:10.720 --> 42:14.560
~ Gone.
~ And that's an end to this
horrible business, I hope.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.300
There is something I would
like to say, Father.

42:20.560 --> 42:24.870
Grateful as I am for your assistance,

42:24.920 --> 42:28.270
nothing that's happened will
change my opinion of you

42:28.320 --> 42:31.920
as a somewhat dangerous
and subversive influence.

42:34.040 --> 42:37.790
By rights, I could
have you all arrested.

42:37.840 --> 42:39.310
Go on, then.

42:39.360 --> 42:42.270
If you imagine that this will
in any way colour our future

42:42.320 --> 42:46.110
dealings, or that your meddling
in police matters is any more

42:46.160 --> 42:49.960
welcome, you're sorely mistaken.

42:51.880 --> 42:53.150
I see.

42:55.720 --> 42:57.350
Well, that's gratitude for you.

42:57.400 --> 43:00.760
Thanks for nothing, Inspector.
Guess I'll see you in court.

43:07.520 --> 43:10.350
I've been informed that due to an...

43:10.400 --> 43:16.000
administrative error, the evidence
in question has been mislaid.

43:17.840 --> 43:20.710
Isn't that right, Sergeant?

43:20.760 --> 43:22.350
Sergeant...

43:22.400 --> 43:24.310
Oh, right. Yes, sir.

43:24.360 --> 43:28.120
Which means we will be forced to
drop all charges on this occasion.

43:29.880 --> 43:34.400
But rest assured, Mr Carter, we will
not be nearly so careless in future.

43:36.720 --> 43:40.950
I want a full investigation as to how
this was allowed to happen, Sergeant.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.150
Heads will roll, mark my words.

43:43.200 --> 43:44.760
Yes, sir.
