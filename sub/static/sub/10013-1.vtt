Hello!

00:33.667 --> 00:35.207
This place is quite nice

00:36.042 --> 00:38.332
Feel free to walk around.
This place is big

00:38.333 --> 00:39.082
Yes

00:39.083 --> 00:41.541
Place that big

00:41.667 --> 00:43.791
allows us to barbeque in the balcony

00:43.792 --> 00:45.332
It can accommodate 1 0 people

00:45.333 --> 00:46.999
What is its property age?

00:47.167 --> 00:48.916
Property age... this place is very new

00:49.167 --> 00:50.541
It was just under renovation

00:50.542 --> 00:51.707
We can see the sunset from here, right?

00:51.708 --> 00:52.332
Yes

00:52.375 --> 00:54.124
You are lucky that have a father
who loves you so much

00:54.125 --> 00:55.374
and buy you such a big house

00:55.375 --> 00:57.457
We are so envy

00:57.542 --> 01:00.416
If it were me, I definitely will put
a big crystal light

03:00.625 --> 03:03.166
Welcome to the party!

03:16.833 --> 03:17.749
Very nice

03:17.750 --> 03:19.082
The beauty on the side...

03:19.083 --> 03:21.749
Yes, this beauty... more feelings

03:22.292 --> 03:23.707
This one is a close-up shot

03:23.833 --> 03:24.291
OK.

03:24.292 --> 03:25.166
Stronger expression

03:33.042 --> 03:33.666
Do you believe?

03:34.167 --> 03:35.957
Master have to increase the brightness

03:36.083 --> 03:37.499
Reduce one level of aperture

03:38.333 --> 03:39.166
How do you know?

03:41.208 --> 03:42.041
Tune it brighter

03:43.083 --> 03:45.916
Brighter. I'd like to
reduce one level of aperture

03:48.208 --> 03:50.291
Last one. Some more smile. 1 , 2, 3!

03:50.542 --> 03:51.249
Good!

03:51.458 --> 03:52.499
Alright. Thank you!

03:52.750 --> 03:53.582
Thank you all of you

03:56.667 --> 03:58.457
Thank you, CK. Well done

03:58.708 --> 04:00.166
Your recent photos are all gorgeous

04:00.167 --> 04:01.874
Look, how handsome!

04:02.042 --> 04:03.124
The reason I invite you

04:03.250 --> 04:06.749
Is because you are the only one in Hong Kong
that could shoot me as a person

04:07.042 --> 04:08.207
You're too modest

04:08.500 --> 04:09.791
Thank you, thank you

04:10.375 --> 04:11.124
Rain

04:12.917 --> 04:13.457
Gong

04:13.542 --> 04:14.291
Thank you

04:15.417 --> 04:17.124
Your idea is really great

04:17.333 --> 04:18.041
Keep it up

04:18.208 --> 04:18.916
Thank you

04:19.416 --> 04:21.666
He is quite good.
Help him where you can

04:22.208 --> 04:23.416
OK. Take care!

04:23.417 --> 04:24.874
Thank you!

04:25.000 --> 04:26.666
Thanks everyone. Goodbye!

04:26.917 --> 04:29.416
Master, Gong could remember my name

04:30.625 --> 04:31.332
What is so great about it

04:37.417 --> 04:38.249
Excuse me...

04:38.500 --> 04:39.207
CK...

04:39.208 --> 04:40.832
Excuse me, I'm late

04:40.917 --> 04:42.207
Sorry...

04:44.208 --> 04:45.457
What is your friend after?

04:45.958 --> 04:47.416
How come he likes to get change in here?

04:48.292 --> 04:49.541
He said it's close to Lang Kwai Fong

04:49.625 --> 04:51.041
And we have everything in here

04:51.042 --> 04:51.957
By the way...

04:51.958 --> 04:53.749
Why don't you go with him for one night

04:53.833 --> 04:54.541
No way

04:54.542 --> 04:55.374
Why not?

04:55.375 --> 04:57.082
You've fallen behind.
How can you shoot?

04:57.333 --> 04:59.624
Frankly, your style is not up to beat

04:59.958 --> 05:01.957
What's the problem?

05:02.458 --> 05:03.291
You can't get anything

05:08.417 --> 05:09.499
This one is not bad

05:10.208 --> 05:13.082
This one is the best
among Gong's clothes

05:13.083 --> 05:13.791
Are you kidding

05:13.875 --> 05:14.707
Put it on

05:16.958 --> 05:18.207
Does it prick?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.374
Nice!

06:30.083 --> 06:31.541
- Hi! - Hi!

06:33.375 --> 06:34.166
Maxim

06:34.500 --> 06:35.249
Jojo

06:35.500 --> 06:36.291
This is Rain

06:42.625 --> 06:44.416
Go walk around and check out what's on

06:45.167 --> 06:46.957
It's not like the old days

06:47.125 --> 06:48.874
We don't need to walk
around to check it out

06:49.167 --> 06:51.916
Take your phone out and
download an apps

06:51.917 --> 06:53.416
Open the night clue webpage

06:53.583 --> 06:55.916
You can see what's on from there

06:56.083 --> 06:56.957
Yes

07:10.375 --> 07:11.124
Keep watching

07:18.417 --> 07:20.707
I always see these twin brothers
come here

07:20.958 --> 07:21.624
That could do?

07:21.750 --> 07:23.999
We are here for just one thing

07:24.125 --> 07:25.666
To play and to be played

07:25.667 --> 07:27.916
Survival of the fittest?
Discovery Channel?

07:28.042 --> 07:29.332
Let me remind you

07:29.417 --> 07:30.749
You can play but
don't play the titanic act

07:31.250 --> 07:31.874
What?

07:31.958 --> 07:32.582
Don't' sink the ship

07:32.625 --> 07:33.749
- You are experienced - Of course

07:33.833 --> 07:35.832
My DNA belongs to night life

07:36.000 --> 07:37.707
I was born in the toilet of 97

07:37.792 --> 07:38.707
I got laid in the Queens

07:38.792 --> 07:41.666
Those Di, Ballroom, Vola,

07:41.667 --> 07:43.332
Play, Beijing, Magnum...

07:43.333 --> 07:44.249
were all my playgrounds

07:44.417 --> 07:45.332
Simply one thing...

07:45.458 --> 07:47.666
I flirt more than you eat

07:48.417 --> 07:49.249
And you are?

07:50.292 --> 07:52.291
My nickname is LKF USB

07:52.333 --> 07:53.249
Thrust wherever l am

07:53.250 --> 07:54.707
Get out afterwards and nothing left

07:56.583 --> 07:58.166
No wonder you are full of virus

08:04.417 --> 08:05.124
Chef Hung!

08:06.250 --> 08:07.916
Haven't seen you for a long time

08:08.000 --> 08:09.582
You become more handsome

08:09.708 --> 08:10.791
Let me introduce a friend to you

08:10.875 --> 08:11.624
This is...

08:12.333 --> 08:13.957
Alex in tuition industry

08:13.958 --> 08:15.874
This one is Sunny in Finance industry

08:16.000 --> 08:17.374
Take a seat

08:17.625 --> 08:20.582
You all are the future of the society

08:20.833 --> 08:22.832
Tutor, l'd like to ask

08:23.250 --> 08:26.416
are you giving lesson
in this time of the day?

08:26.458 --> 08:27.291
You don't know nothing

08:27.458 --> 08:28.916
The most important thing
is all the students...

08:28.917 --> 08:30.374
...have their lessons in there

08:31.583 --> 08:33.374
Cheers!

08:33.875 --> 08:35.124
Chef Hung, your man?

08:35.332 --> 08:36.957
He looks after the stock market for me

08:36.957 --> 08:38.624
Hi, I am Avis, Chef Hung's assistant

08:38.832 --> 08:40.916
Nice to meet you

08:41.292 --> 08:43.207
Hi everyone,
I don't have a business card yet

08:43.332 --> 08:44.832
I am the second assistant, Wai

08:44.958 --> 08:46.124
Second assistant?

08:46.250 --> 08:47.416
Funny

08:48.042 --> 08:49.041
Do you know how to change?

08:49.042 --> 08:50.624
Yes, I can become a waiter immediately

08:50.792 --> 08:51.916
How about becoming a waitress

08:52.125 --> 08:55.166
Cheers!

08:56.917 --> 08:58.791
Hi!

08:58.917 --> 08:59.707
Shall we play together?

09:00.667 --> 09:02.749
Together... I want her

09:04.583 --> 09:05.541
What is your name?

09:05.875 --> 09:07.041
I am QQ

09:07.458 --> 09:08.916
QQ?

09:09.167 --> 09:11.999
Are you really cute?

09:13.417 --> 09:14.332
Take a seat

09:14.750 --> 09:18.332
Senior, how come those girls act like
they have GPS installed?

09:18.542 --> 09:22.249
They come automatically
once we open the bottle

09:22.958 --> 09:25.916
They are here to earn, not to play

09:26.042 --> 09:28.332
Prostitute? But they don't
look like they are

09:28.458 --> 09:29.832
Anyway, remember

09:30.083 --> 09:33.249
Whoever your boss touched,
never get your hands on her

09:33.708 --> 09:34.416
This is a good place

09:34.417 --> 09:35.832
- OK? - OK.

09:36.292 --> 09:38.541
I've lost my memory last night.
I'm so wan and sallow

09:39.375 --> 09:41.082
Drink one with me

09:41.167 --> 09:42.041
Don't you worry that...

09:42.667 --> 09:43.791
I'll affect your hunting
if I drink with you?

09:44.042 --> 09:47.124
I don't need to hunt.
The prey will come themselves

09:47.417 --> 09:48.166
Fuck!

09:49.125 --> 09:50.124
Just one kiss

09:50.250 --> 09:51.624
No way

09:51.750 --> 09:52.666
You may

09:54.667 --> 09:55.832
Take a seat behind and wait for me

09:55.958 --> 09:56.791
OK.

09:56.917 --> 09:57.624
You're good

09:59.250 --> 10:00.374
He is my friend, Rain

10:01.042 --> 10:02.374
She is Dim

10:02.458 --> 10:03.541
One of the shareholders in here

10:03.667 --> 10:07.249
She is a modern erotic writer

10:07.875 --> 10:10.207
He keeps saying I write erotic novels

10:10.333 --> 10:12.124
I definitely not an erotic novel writer

10:12.208 --> 10:13.749
There is no love, just flesh

10:13.750 --> 10:15.082
Just write his foolish acts

10:15.167 --> 10:15.999
You called Rain?

10:16.292 --> 10:17.082
Dim

10:17.083 --> 10:17.707
Come and see me when you have time

10:17.708 --> 10:18.791
Hey, hey, hey...

10:18.833 --> 10:20.791
He is my friend and you're not gonna
flirt with him, right?

10:21.208 --> 10:23.916
If l don't flirt with handsome,
who shall I flirt with?

10:24.000 --> 10:25.499
That's nonsense

10:26.792 --> 10:27.957
I think I'm really drunk

10:28.542 --> 10:30.207
Come and drink...

10:35.917 --> 10:37.207
Hey man... excuse me...

10:37.208 --> 10:38.249
Still need to wait?

10:38.333 --> 10:40.249
I've been waiting for more than an hour

10:40.375 --> 10:41.541
It's full up there

10:42.917 --> 10:44.749
Hey! Didn't you say it's full?

10:45.000 --> 10:45.874
They are ladies

10:46.000 --> 10:46.916
Am I human?

10:46.958 --> 10:47.874
Are you Alex Fong?

10:47.917 --> 10:49.541
No way, l don't look that ugly

10:50.333 --> 10:52.207
Do I look like Alex Fong?

10:52.333 --> 10:53.249
Quite like him

10:53.375 --> 10:55.541
If you are not Alex Fong...
you gotta wait for a while

10:55.542 --> 10:56.749
How come Alex Fong could
get in but l couldn't?

10:57.000 --> 10:58.041
It's full

10:58.208 --> 10:59.666
I should have pretended l'm him

11:00.125 --> 11:00.749
Shit!

11:01.125 --> 11:02.041
Let me show you

11:02.500 --> 11:03.249
Look, that fatso

11:03.625 --> 11:05.624
He will find an excuse
to come here later on

11:05.625 --> 11:07.082
and drink all our wine

11:07.208 --> 11:08.416
get all our girls

11:08.792 --> 11:09.582
Chef Hung!

11:11.542 --> 11:13.124
Don't you remember me?

11:13.250 --> 11:15.541
Andrew the pediatrician

11:15.667 --> 11:16.332
Give me five!

11:17.833 --> 11:19.374
You guys don't drink? How come?

11:19.500 --> 11:21.666
He really thinks he is home

11:22.042 --> 11:23.124
Look at him...

11:23.833 --> 11:27.166
He does it every time.
Pour and drink by himself

11:27.333 --> 11:28.666
and never drink with us

11:28.667 --> 11:29.957
Finished all the wine...

11:30.208 --> 11:31.832
Those are our wine

11:31.958 --> 11:34.082
This fatso is not too bad

11:34.458 --> 11:35.666
Not too bad?

11:35.875 --> 11:38.791
He is waiting for the girls
to become drunk

11:38.917 --> 11:40.207
and take them away when he got a chance

11:40.208 --> 11:41.041
Rascal?

11:43.833 --> 11:44.624
Look

11:45.292 --> 11:46.707
Let's go...

11:46.708 --> 11:47.416
Wai!

11:48.042 --> 11:49.166
Come and pour us some wine!

11:53.000 --> 11:53.791
Boss...

11:55.958 --> 11:58.124
Mister, we have a promotion today

11:58.250 --> 11:59.291
May I ask how do you like to drink?

11:59.542 --> 12:01.332
You still need to ask? How can we drink?

12:01.375 --> 12:03.791
Do you want apple, peach...

12:03.875 --> 12:05.582
melon or watermelon?

12:05.750 --> 12:06.916
I want it when The Fruit is Swelling

12:07.042 --> 12:09.832
I like both melon and watermelon

12:09.875 --> 12:10.749
How about both?

12:10.875 --> 12:11.624
Ok

12:15.083 --> 12:17.249
Thank you

12:26.125 --> 12:26.791
Summer!

12:27.000 --> 12:27.541
Wait...

12:27.667 --> 12:29.541
Let me go.
Go home and stay with your wife!

12:30.917 --> 12:31.707
Come on!

12:31.833 --> 12:34.749
Man like me can't be single

12:34.875 --> 12:37.541
Two people together are
for love and sex anyway

12:37.542 --> 12:39.041
You can spend as much as you want.

12:39.125 --> 12:40.291
What else do you want?

12:42.083 --> 12:42.916
You are crazy!

12:43.042 --> 12:45.082
Everyone calm down

12:45.167 --> 12:46.207
Beware of the glass...

12:46.250 --> 12:47.207
I like to play, I like night life

12:47.208 --> 12:50.041
But it doesn't mean l will do anything.
Let alone being the intruder

12:51.333 --> 12:52.791
I have a lot of money

12:52.958 --> 12:55.207
I didn't spend a penny of your card

12:55.875 --> 12:57.082
Dim, one round for everyone, my treat

12:57.333 --> 12:58.041
Thank you

12:58.250 --> 12:58.916
Enjoy

12:59.042 --> 13:00.374
For everyone here!

13:08.167 --> 13:09.374
Have you cooled down now?

13:15.833 --> 13:16.707
She's in sane

13:24.375 --> 13:26.291
How are you? Are you ok?

13:26.708 --> 13:27.624
How are you?

13:27.917 --> 13:29.749
I will kick his ass if l were you!

13:29.917 --> 13:30.874
Yes! Give me five!

13:31.583 --> 13:33.332
I really wanna break his leg!

13:33.458 --> 13:35.041
The third one?

13:35.042 --> 13:37.249
You are great, disgrace him like that

13:38.125 --> 13:40.291
Cheers

13:40.292 --> 13:41.707
Ok, ok...

13:43.958 --> 13:44.749
You know him?

13:45.250 --> 13:46.124
Your friend?

13:46.417 --> 13:48.207
You! What's wrong with you, man?

13:48.375 --> 13:50.374
Nothing wrong, I feel kinda right

13:50.500 --> 13:52.749
You've poured my peach wine

13:52.875 --> 13:55.791
It's fair that l drink a glass of yours

13:56.083 --> 13:57.082
We even up, ok?

13:57.792 --> 13:58.541
Fine.

13:59.125 --> 14:00.041
Do something

14:01.750 --> 14:02.416
Rain

14:04.875 --> 14:05.624
Summer

14:06.458 --> 14:07.999
This is Linda

14:08.125 --> 14:09.582
Angelina and Sita

14:09.875 --> 14:12.791
I haven't seen you before.
You seldom come here?

14:12.875 --> 14:16.749
I usually drink in the upstairs store

14:16.833 --> 14:18.749
All you can drink for just 250.
It's cheap

14:18.750 --> 14:19.624
I can bring you there next time

14:20.333 --> 14:21.791
Are you really here for the first time?

14:21.792 --> 14:22.666
Yes

14:22.750 --> 14:26.041
You got my first time,
you have to take the responsibility

14:26.417 --> 14:27.332
Old fashioned

14:30.000 --> 14:31.874
Summer, don't stay by the side

14:32.000 --> 14:33.207
Come and play with us

14:33.333 --> 14:35.457
Yes, I haven't drink
with you for a long time

14:35.542 --> 14:36.457
Let's drink together

14:36.542 --> 14:38.166
I don't want to drink with you

14:38.333 --> 14:39.791
Disgrace us like that?

14:44.167 --> 14:45.249
Who are you?

14:45.583 --> 14:46.874
Did I say l want to drink with you?

14:48.167 --> 14:50.499
My sister called Jeana, I'm Ginger

14:50.667 --> 14:52.541
If you're that great,
why don't we play something big

14:53.125 --> 14:54.791
Good! How?

14:55.000 --> 14:56.916
Everyone, the finale of tonight

14:57.042 --> 14:59.666
Whoever dare to drink
the 8 test tubes of wine

14:59.667 --> 15:01.416
from our sexy bikini girls

15:01.417 --> 15:02.749
Who is the winner of tonight!

15:03.125 --> 15:05.541
Let's play this.
It's exciting. Let's play...

15:05.667 --> 15:06.416
You guys play

15:06.667 --> 15:08.249
You play. My girlfriend is
over there watching me

15:08.333 --> 15:10.832
You're in sane, everyone has Weibo apps
on their phone

15:10.833 --> 15:12.957
If they posted it on the net,
how can l play anymore?

15:13.333 --> 15:14.541
You don't have a guts

15:14.958 --> 15:15.541
You play

15:15.542 --> 15:16.207
I'll go

15:16.250 --> 15:17.291
OK...

15:17.333 --> 15:19.207
Great!

16:07.375 --> 16:10.166
Good! This handsome is
the bravest man of tonight!

16:10.250 --> 16:11.374
You are the winner!

16:17.083 --> 16:19.291
Great!

16:19.292 --> 16:20.124
So great!

16:20.250 --> 16:20.957
It's for you

16:21.000 --> 16:21.999
Thank you

16:22.625 --> 16:23.916
You are useless

16:24.208 --> 16:26.124
Come on, piss off, go away!

16:26.375 --> 16:28.082
Bye!

16:30.458 --> 16:31.541
Sorry. Excuse me.

16:31.625 --> 16:33.249
- How is it? - So great...

16:33.292 --> 16:34.874
Those girls over there are even better

16:35.000 --> 16:37.082
They want to know you, so...

16:37.708 --> 16:38.291
Go!

16:38.417 --> 16:39.666
- What's up? - Let's go

16:39.667 --> 16:40.416
I shall go now

16:40.542 --> 16:41.541
Go

16:44.375 --> 16:45.457
Let me tell you...

16:46.292 --> 16:50.874
I've earned... 2 million tonight

16:51.625 --> 16:52.999
So, tomorrow...

16:53.792 --> 16:55.832
Everyone can have... 200 thousand...

16:56.833 --> 16:57.541
as bonus

16:57.542 --> 16:58.332
Thanks, boss

16:58.625 --> 16:59.249
Thanks, chef

16:59.250 --> 17:00.291
Thanks, boss

17:00.333 --> 17:01.249
I can't...

17:01.292 --> 17:03.041
I can't stand it... I'm going

17:03.167 --> 17:04.040
Let me fetch you, boss

17:04.541 --> 17:05.707
What do you mean by fetching me?

17:06.000 --> 17:07.874
I can go by myself!

17:08.625 --> 17:11.374
Take care, chef

17:11.458 --> 17:12.499
200 thousand...

17:12.791 --> 17:14.999
He is always very mean, how come he is
so ostentatious this time?

17:15.000 --> 17:16.915
In night club, after 1 2 o'clock...

17:17.041 --> 17:18.582
and you believe what he says?

17:19.833 --> 17:21.624
What do you mean? So...

17:21.625 --> 17:23.249
The 200 thousand... was bullshit?

17:24.041 --> 17:25.415
You may see if we could get it tomorrow

17:25.875 --> 17:27.874
This bastard. And you've worked for him
for 3 years?

17:29.625 --> 17:32.332
There is no boss that is not a bastard

17:32.500 --> 17:34.541
Take your time, buddy

17:51.250 --> 17:52.249
No

17:52.625 --> 17:55.166
There is a closed-circuit TV in here.
There are many people

17:55.333 --> 17:56.791
How about a while later

17:57.000 --> 17:58.124
I do investment

17:58.333 --> 18:01.124
If you invest more,
you could have more in return

18:01.250 --> 18:02.166
Don't waste your time

18:12.375 --> 18:15.374
Those girls, Natalie, Anita, May, Mary

18:15.375 --> 18:16.249
All want to know you

18:16.458 --> 18:18.041
They're pretty girls

18:18.458 --> 18:19.957
I count on you

18:19.958 --> 18:21.416
Let's move to other place

18:21.625 --> 18:22.791
Other place, other place

18:22.792 --> 18:23.791
Get your bag...

18:23.792 --> 18:24.541
Go

18:27.375 --> 18:28.082
I shall go first

18:32.417 --> 18:33.582
What are you doing?

18:33.667 --> 18:34.707
I want your number

18:35.792 --> 18:37.332
We just know each other

18:37.417 --> 18:40.332
We gotta get the number once we know
each other at a night club. Be quick

18:40.500 --> 18:41.582
Give it to him

18:41.625 --> 18:42.832
Fucking asshole, hurry up, man!

18:42.833 --> 18:44.249
You better go farther away
if you wanna flirt, asshole!

18:45.375 --> 18:46.499
Leave us alone!

18:46.792 --> 18:47.791
Telephone!

18:47.875 --> 18:48.624
Let's go!

18:48.625 --> 18:49.499
Bye-bye!

18:54.917 --> 18:55.624
Hi.

18:56.167 --> 18:56.874
Hello.

18:57.042 --> 18:57.791
My name is Don

18:58.208 --> 18:58.874
I am Anita

18:59.542 --> 19:00.541
May I ask you a question

19:00.792 --> 19:03.332
Do you believe the year 201 2
is the end of the world?

19:05.417 --> 19:07.332
Just like you,
I didn't believe it before

19:07.458 --> 19:09.249
But there is something
that you gotta believe

19:09.500 --> 19:12.249
Add your age to your year of birth

19:12.250 --> 19:13.957
The result must be 201 2

19:15.208 --> 19:16.166
Why?

19:18.542 --> 19:21.041
Many things are due to one reason,
it's fate

19:21.333 --> 19:23.707
Therefore we should... grasp the time

19:23.958 --> 19:24.832
What do you mean?

19:39.792 --> 19:41.166
Summer! Summer!

19:43.500 --> 19:44.791
Would you give me your number?

19:45.417 --> 19:46.332
It's you, the bastard again?

19:46.333 --> 19:46.916
No, l...

19:46.917 --> 19:47.916
Not enough beating?

19:47.917 --> 19:49.249
Beat you!

19:49.542 --> 19:50.541
Hey! Hey...

19:52.333 --> 19:53.541
Stop!

19:54.208 --> 19:54.874
Don't come!

19:56.833 --> 19:57.707
Number...

20:03.458 --> 20:05.249
Let's go. Get in the car

20:07.417 --> 20:08.332
Let me fix him

21:05.875 --> 21:06.457
How?

21:06.708 --> 21:07.416
Maxim!

21:07.750 --> 21:09.541
Maxim, there is a foreigner
who is touched me!

21:09.542 --> 21:10.124
What?

21:10.125 --> 21:11.291
- What's up?
- There is a foreigner who touched me.

21:11.292 --> 21:12.332
Come quickly

21:16.625 --> 21:18.332
It's him! He pinched me!

21:19.000 --> 21:19.666
You!

21:20.333 --> 21:21.541
Why did you hit my friend?

21:23.125 --> 21:24.707
Go to hell! Go to hell!

21:25.292 --> 21:26.457
Hey... stop it!

21:26.458 --> 21:27.416
Stop it!

21:28.292 --> 21:29.374
Don't hit him!

21:29.958 --> 21:30.874
This crazy bitch kicks me!

21:31.667 --> 21:32.707
Don't...

21:33.000 --> 21:33.541
Stop.

21:33.917 --> 21:34.874
Miss, come over here

21:35.625 --> 21:36.582
Officer, why don't you grab them?

21:36.583 --> 21:38.041
- Identity card
- What identity card?

21:38.042 --> 21:39.916
- We were being hit, why not grab them?
- Identity card!

21:40.042 --> 21:40.791
You, too

21:41.125 --> 21:41.749
What's the matter?

21:42.292 --> 21:43.957
They sexual harassed my friend!

21:44.125 --> 21:45.291
Excuse me, identity card

21:45.667 --> 21:47.832
It's them who committed
sexual harassment!

21:48.625 --> 21:50.582
Miss, identity card, please

21:57.000 --> 21:57.874
Calling the base

21:58.000 --> 21:58.791
Do you want to charge them?

22:00.083 --> 22:00.874
No, forget it!

22:01.167 --> 22:02.207
Are you sure you won't ask for it again?

22:02.833 --> 22:04.374
No, forget it!

22:07.958 --> 22:09.832
They are not gonna pursue

22:10.042 --> 22:12.416
If you want to charge them, you gotta
go to the police station with us

22:12.542 --> 22:13.749
No, forget it

22:13.750 --> 22:14.832
Officer, it's alright now

22:14.833 --> 22:15.624
You may go now

22:15.875 --> 22:18.791
Forget it. I shouldn't rely on you police
to protect us...

22:19.000 --> 22:19.874
Dreaming

22:20.333 --> 22:21.624
If you feel resentful
and want to complain,

22:21.792 --> 22:23.041
you may call the
Complaints Against Police Organization

22:23.417 --> 22:25.416
I would suggest you two
to mind how you wear

22:30.000 --> 22:31.666
Actually that police is quite cool

22:31.875 --> 22:32.541
Shut up!

22:38.000 --> 22:40.124
Miss, is it that touching?

22:40.125 --> 22:41.707
You've been crying for the whole movie?

22:42.292 --> 22:43.541
I feel touching

22:43.667 --> 22:46.791
The male character can give out
his life for the female character

22:46.875 --> 22:48.499
Nothing like this in reality

22:53.250 --> 22:53.999
Hey! Hey!

22:56.583 --> 22:57.749
What's up? You...

22:57.750 --> 22:59.041
Are you in sane?

22:59.042 --> 23:01.582
You two... don't want to live, are you?

23:02.083 --> 23:03.416
Are you crazy?

23:04.250 --> 23:05.582
I'd like to tell you...

23:06.292 --> 23:07.082
I can do it, too

23:21.792 --> 23:23.166
Hey! The two in the front!

23:23.792 --> 23:24.374
Stop!

23:24.375 --> 23:25.791
You two, stop! Don't run!

23:25.792 --> 23:26.541
Stop! Hey!

23:26.875 --> 23:27.541
Hey

26:27.125 --> 26:27.791
What's up, master?

26:27.875 --> 26:29.249
Looks like in heat

26:29.542 --> 26:32.166
Tell me. Are you going out with someone?

26:33.000 --> 26:33.749
Do I look like so?

26:34.208 --> 26:35.874
Even the blind can tell

26:37.458 --> 26:38.291
Why are you here?

26:38.917 --> 26:40.916
I've bought a cake and wanna give it
to you and your colleagues

26:41.417 --> 26:42.457
You must be CK

26:42.667 --> 26:43.666
I am Summer

26:43.792 --> 26:45.041
Let's have the cake. Eat up

26:45.292 --> 26:46.124
Don't worry. Don't worry

26:46.250 --> 26:48.291
I'll make myself comfortable

26:50.417 --> 26:51.582
You all have some, too

26:52.875 --> 26:53.624
Me, too?

26:53.625 --> 26:54.791
Thank you

26:54.792 --> 26:57.082
This cake... is specially nice

26:57.750 --> 26:58.791
You know what to eat

27:00.542 --> 27:02.207
How is it? Is the cake nice?

27:02.458 --> 27:04.041
Very nice!

27:06.208 --> 27:07.582
You live in here, right?

27:07.708 --> 27:08.999
Show me around

27:10.667 --> 27:12.832
This place is small. Better not

27:13.042 --> 27:15.207
Don't worry. I wanna see how small it is

27:15.292 --> 27:16.166
Come on

27:16.667 --> 27:19.332
Just show her around

27:28.667 --> 27:30.582
This place... is like a warehouse

27:30.750 --> 27:31.666
Where do you sleep?

27:36.083 --> 27:37.082
So cute!

27:50.500 --> 27:52.124
It is so cute here

27:52.958 --> 27:54.166
Don't you feel squeezing in here?

27:54.417 --> 27:56.041
No, it's cute

27:57.083 --> 27:58.499
If you like it here...

27:58.708 --> 28:00.082
you may always come and sleep

28:04.542 --> 28:05.499
I have something for you

28:06.500 --> 28:07.707
Why do you give me a rabbit?

28:08.083 --> 28:09.957
It's a lucky rabbit

28:10.083 --> 28:10.957
We both have one

28:14.667 --> 28:16.832
Is it... a token of love?

28:18.042 --> 28:19.332
Give it back to me

28:21.292 --> 28:22.582
I'll keep it carefully

28:29.292 --> 28:30.249
Nice to meet you!

28:31.333 --> 28:32.082
Hello

28:32.375 --> 28:33.124
I am Don

28:35.167 --> 28:36.166
Do you believe...

28:36.333 --> 28:38.291
that the year 201 2 is
the end of the world?

28:39.167 --> 28:40.207
The end of the world?

28:40.333 --> 28:41.166
Do you believe it?

28:41.833 --> 28:42.791
I do

28:43.208 --> 28:46.041
Why don't we do something meaningful...

28:46.167 --> 28:47.374
before the end of the world comes

29:39.750 --> 29:41.166
No way. Jump the red light again?

30:30.000 --> 30:31.207
Good morning.

30:31.542 --> 30:33.499
Shit! I've messed up this time!

30:46.250 --> 30:47.082
Where is my phone?

30:48.500 --> 30:50.457
Are you carrying it?

30:51.625 --> 30:53.832
It's the same style but not mine

30:54.042 --> 30:55.082
Look for it yourself

30:56.208 --> 30:56.999
Keep in touch

30:57.583 --> 30:59.791
You don't have my number.
How can we keep in touch?

31:08.833 --> 31:09.832
I'm in trouble

31:14.583 --> 31:15.332
Thanks, boss

31:18.958 --> 31:20.832
Who are you? So nice

31:25.792 --> 31:27.041
Can't see her face

31:29.583 --> 31:30.374
I shall call myself first

31:32.292 --> 31:34.041
If you are the owner of this number,
we probably had mixed up our phones.

31:34.042 --> 31:36.832
Please reply me when you see this.

31:47.792 --> 31:51.249
Hi!

Thank you.

32:03.500 --> 32:04.207
You drive

32:04.500 --> 32:06.291
You better be careful

32:06.292 --> 32:08.249
Don't crash the car

32:08.250 --> 32:08.874
Alright

32:09.583 --> 32:10.457
I'll sit here

32:12.667 --> 32:13.916
So sweet

32:14.625 --> 32:15.541
I wanna drive, too

32:15.542 --> 32:17.249
I wanna drive a branded car, too

32:23.000 --> 32:24.207
Bye...

32:27.167 --> 32:28.332
You always shop crazily?

32:28.917 --> 32:30.291
It's just tiny bit this time

32:30.292 --> 32:31.249
Tiny bit?

32:31.375 --> 32:32.749
I'm hungry. Let's eat

32:32.875 --> 32:33.749

33:48.000 --> 33:49.291
Hi! Rain!

33:49.583 --> 33:51.957
Hello!

33:52.125 --> 33:52.999
Do you remember me?

33:53.125 --> 33:53.999
Still remember me?

33:54.583 --> 33:55.499
Linda!

33:55.625 --> 33:56.916
Yeah! How are you doing?

33:59.125 --> 34:00.082
I do picture.

34:00.083 --> 34:02.041
I do picture. Yeah...

34:04.333 --> 34:05.874
He's funny guy.

34:06.333 --> 34:08.041
Hello!

34:08.042 --> 34:09.206
Let me introduce to you

Hi, nice to meet you! l'm Fiona.

34:12.875 --> 34:13.706
Nice to meet you!

34:13.792 --> 34:14.666
Have l seen you before?

34:16.750 --> 34:19.416
Don't worry. I can speak Cantonese.

34:20.125 --> 34:22.248
Don't worry...

34:27.292 --> 34:27.916
Pretty

34:28.125 --> 34:28.791
Huh?

34:28.833 --> 34:31.081
Do you believe the year of 201 2
is the end of the world?

34:31.167 --> 34:32.041
I do

34:32.542 --> 34:34.998
So do you believe it's a fate that...

34:35.000 --> 34:36.041
we meet in here?

34:36.125 --> 34:36.956
I do

34:37.125 --> 34:38.291
So don't waste the time!

34:43.917 --> 34:44.623
Sorry.

34:44.917 --> 34:45.831
Who is it?

34:47.167 --> 34:48.331
Siri?

34:48.500 --> 34:49.416
What's up?

34:50.292 --> 34:50.998
I'll call you tomorrow

34:51.417 --> 34:52.831
Did you say it's the end of the world?

34:52.917 --> 34:53.956
There is no tomorrow

34:54.083 --> 34:55.081
Are you ok?

34:56.792 --> 34:57.916
I can't communicate with them

34:58.833 --> 35:01.082
Don't feel offended.
They are from overseas

35:01.167 --> 35:02.374
They always speak in English

35:02.458 --> 35:04.499
You may speak Mandarin to them next time.
I'm sure they can't utter a word

35:06.833 --> 35:08.207
If l didn't get it wrong

35:08.208 --> 35:09.749
You should be in white hair

35:09.833 --> 35:11.249
Let me see your face

35:11.417 --> 35:12.082
Good

35:15.708 --> 35:18.332
You look depress and
need some excitement

35:20.333 --> 35:21.082
Ok

35:21.292 --> 35:24.624
Why don't you give me some excitement

35:35.000 --> 35:37.999
What's... your... name?

35:39.208 --> 35:40.457
Tell me yours first.

35:46.125 --> 35:46.791
Dicky

35:47.958 --> 35:48.916
Siri

35:50.833 --> 35:53.707
I really called Dicky

35:54.667 --> 35:56.582
I do call Siri, too

35:56.667 --> 35:58.957
Dick-Dick, what can I do for you?

36:01.625 --> 36:02.666
How about...

36:03.250 --> 36:04.624

36:06.375 --> 36:09.082
It depends on your sincerity

There are a lot of girls around,

36:25.500 --> 36:27.207
This doesn't look like
you have sincerity

36:27.333 --> 36:29.207
It's just a bastard look

36:31.000 --> 36:31.832
You've fucked up

36:34.083 --> 36:36.624
Angelina wanna change a place.

Hi!

37:01.958 --> 37:02.749
Alex Fong

37:02.917 --> 37:03.666
You're kidding

37:04.167 --> 37:05.291
I'm really Alex Fong

37:05.500 --> 37:06.791
In which way you look like Alex Fong?

37:06.875 --> 37:08.457
You said I look like him last week

37:08.542 --> 37:09.582
That was last week

37:09.708 --> 37:11.124
It's not working now?

37:11.583 --> 37:12.207
All are my friends

37:12.208 --> 37:12.791
Please come in

37:12.792 --> 37:13.874
Go in

37:15.375 --> 37:16.666
He really looks like Alex Fong

37:17.917 --> 37:18.957
How can Jacqueline get in there?

37:19.083 --> 37:20.374
She's Jacqueline Chong

37:20.500 --> 37:21.916
Jacqueline Chong is fine, but Alex Fong?

37:22.042 --> 37:22.957
It's full

37:23.250 --> 37:24.832
So how can I get in?

37:25.083 --> 37:26.207
Wait for a while

37:28.458 --> 37:29.416
Connie...

37:29.458 --> 37:30.499
Connie, drink! Connie, drink!

37:30.625 --> 37:32.124
Ah, yes

37:32.375 --> 37:33.957
Hezel!

37:33.958 --> 37:34.957
You're here?

37:34.958 --> 37:37.207
You look pretty today.
Come and drink, too

37:37.542 --> 37:39.499
Chef Hung, I think...

37:39.542 --> 37:41.499
the two of them are so poor

37:41.667 --> 37:43.666
Shall we invite them to play

37:44.167 --> 37:45.374
They look poor?

37:45.958 --> 37:47.999
Let me ask them if they are poor

37:48.542 --> 37:51.082
You two, do you feel poor?

37:54.000 --> 37:54.791
No

37:55.042 --> 37:57.207
They dare not to tell you
even if they are

37:57.417 --> 38:00.332
Oh... come on...

38:03.083 --> 38:04.916
No, boss...

38:04.917 --> 38:06.374
This is real poor!

Thank you!

38:18.875 --> 38:19.749
Excuse me, everyone

38:19.750 --> 38:21.166
I'm a bit late

38:21.667 --> 38:22.957
3 drinks for the late penalty

38:23.042 --> 38:24.832
Drink one as I've just arrived

38:25.000 --> 38:26.041
Why are you so late?

38:26.333 --> 38:27.916
What's up, QQ? Miss me?

38:28.167 --> 38:31.041
That day... you left first

38:31.333 --> 38:32.666
and seemed that...

38:33.875 --> 38:35.207
you've paid 1 ,000 less

38:36.625 --> 38:37.624
What do you mean?

38:38.083 --> 38:39.791
Do you mean I cheated you?

38:40.083 --> 38:42.499
Any wine I buy worth more than that

38:42.500 --> 38:43.332
Do I need to cheat you?

38:43.458 --> 38:45.874
QQ, did you drink too much that night?

38:45.875 --> 38:47.332
Yes, did you drink too much?

38:47.333 --> 38:48.832
Think it carefully

38:49.208 --> 38:50.832
Sorry... l'm so sorry!

38:50.833 --> 38:52.499
I think maybe I've forgotten

38:52.583 --> 38:54.166
I shall drink one as punishment

38:54.333 --> 38:55.249
Gulp down

39:00.250 --> 39:02.207
This bastard, cheats her hard-earned

39:03.333 --> 39:04.582
Don't poke your nose
into others' business

39:07.250 --> 39:08.124
Siri?

39:08.958 --> 39:09.582
Hello?

39:10.167 --> 39:11.082
Hello, Dicky!

39:11.375 --> 39:13.374
Do you really wanna see how l look?

39:13.375 --> 39:14.249
How do you know?

39:14.625 --> 39:16.166
Your voice is actually that nice

39:16.292 --> 39:18.874
I have an even better voice.
Do you wanna hear?

39:19.000 --> 39:19.874
Of course I do

39:20.042 --> 39:21.957
Will it make me carried away?

39:25.958 --> 39:28.666
Joey, haven't seen you
for a long time. One shot

39:33.917 --> 39:35.166
Sunny, for you!

39:37.042 --> 39:38.624

Excuse me...

I'm sorry, l'm sorry...

39:42.167 --> 39:42.832
Thank you

39:42.833 --> 39:43.749
For you... one more for you...

39:43.750 --> 39:44.666
Excuse me...

39:54.042 --> 39:55.041
Hi! Maxim

39:55.167 --> 39:55.832
Hi!

40:01.500 --> 40:03.041
You're drunk. Shall we go?

40:03.458 --> 40:04.332
I'm not drunk yet

40:04.542 --> 40:08.041
I'll have another one with Angelina
after I come back from the loo

40:09.375 --> 40:10.499
Angelina!

40:10.583 --> 40:11.666
Don't worry. I'll take care of her

40:11.667 --> 40:12.916
Come here, my dear!

40:12.917 --> 40:15.332
Just a minute. I wanna go, too

40:20.458 --> 40:22.082
Happy Birthday!

40:24.042 --> 40:27.166
Thank you!

40:27.458 --> 40:28.874
Finish this one first...

40:29.458 --> 40:30.457
Cheers...

40:30.458 --> 40:31.374
Thank you!

40:31.417 --> 40:33.207
The wine is almost finished

40:34.042 --> 40:36.291
Angelina, now we are here

40:36.292 --> 40:38.332
We must give you a gift

40:39.000 --> 40:41.207
We should at least open
another bottle for Angelina

40:41.208 --> 40:42.499
Right, Angelina?

40:42.792 --> 40:46.041
Sure. I wanna drink Champagne Rose

40:47.208 --> 40:48.624
Dim, 3 bottles of Dom!

40:48.708 --> 40:51.041
3 bottles?
3 bottles are not enough. Maybe 6

40:51.250 --> 40:52.499
Not enough. 1 0 bottles!

41:00.167 --> 41:02.332
Thank you! Thank you!

41:04.000 --> 41:06.999
Rain, it was a mess last time

41:07.083 --> 41:09.082
Just apologize and we can pretend
nothing had happened

41:09.125 --> 41:10.582
Today is Angelina's birthday

41:10.583 --> 41:14.291
We've given our gifts. How about you?

41:14.292 --> 41:16.082
Don't say that to him

41:16.208 --> 41:17.749
Do you think
1 0 bottles of Dom are cheap?

41:17.833 --> 41:19.916
It's not that anyone can afford

41:20.458 --> 41:23.082
How about this.
You pay one bottle as a courtesy

41:23.083 --> 41:24.916
Others are mine

41:25.042 --> 41:26.874
Don't tell me not even one bottle

41:29.833 --> 41:30.457
Ok

41:31.292 --> 41:32.999
Dim, one more. His treat!

41:44.875 --> 41:45.832
3 thousand...

41:46.875 --> 41:48.666
Please borrow 3 thousand for me first

41:53.083 --> 41:53.791

41:54.167 --> 41:55.291
It's all yours

41:55.375 --> 41:56.041
What?

41:56.250 --> 41:57.582
I've given you the money for the room!

42:02.292 --> 42:03.707
Do I need to lend you a room?

42:03.792 --> 42:05.666
You're so bad Don't make fun of others

42:05.750 --> 42:06.541
Police inspection!

42:06.625 --> 42:07.874

42:13.833 --> 42:14.374
Identity card

42:14.583 --> 42:15.707
I am a DJ here

42:15.792 --> 42:16.874
Doesn't DJ have an identity card?

42:18.042 --> 42:20.166
That police had checked me before

42:20.292 --> 42:21.082
I want him to check mine

42:21.250 --> 42:22.541
You don't have to
teach the police on how to do

42:23.000 --> 42:23.999
Let me do it

42:24.000 --> 42:24.874

Sorry, Sir.

42:44.625 --> 42:45.207
Retreat!

43:05.208 --> 43:06.957
Where are you going?

43:07.708 --> 43:10.124
- Take care! - Some more...

43:10.417 --> 43:11.124
What's up?

43:11.417 --> 43:12.416
Get drunk again

43:12.417 --> 43:13.291
Play overnight again?

43:13.375 --> 43:15.791
Some more...

43:15.792 --> 43:16.707
Are you the new driver?

43:16.792 --> 43:17.457
How about Ben?

43:18.792 --> 43:20.457
No... I am Summer's friend

43:20.458 --> 43:21.166
I am Rain

43:24.667 --> 43:25.624
Your car is parking outside?

43:26.417 --> 43:28.916
No, l had just...
brought her back by taxi

43:29.000 --> 43:31.249
Maid, call a taxi for me later

43:31.375 --> 43:32.041
Yes

43:55.917 --> 43:58.249
Hey, what's up? How are you?

43:58.250 --> 43:59.999
- Don't bother me - Are you alone?

44:00.417 --> 44:02.499
Hey, let her go!

44:02.542 --> 44:03.707
She is my girlfriend.

44:03.792 --> 44:04.707
Go away!

44:05.000 --> 44:05.874
Go!

44:06.417 --> 44:07.249
What are you doing here?

44:07.250 --> 44:08.791
I want to go home

44:09.000 --> 44:09.832
Are you by yourself?

44:10.208 --> 44:12.124
- I feel dizzy...
- How about your friends?

44:13.333 --> 44:15.041
I wanna go home...

44:15.042 --> 44:16.082
Let me fetch you home

44:16.458 --> 44:18.707
I wanna go home...

44:18.792 --> 44:19.582
Where do you live?

44:23.125 --> 44:23.916
Watch out

44:26.125 --> 44:27.332
You gotta watch out

44:28.375 --> 44:29.874
Raise your legs

44:30.583 --> 44:31.582
Sit inside

44:32.708 --> 44:33.374
Hey...

44:34.125 --> 44:36.582
You... sit still

44:36.750 --> 44:38.249
You sit still...

44:38.917 --> 44:40.582
Sit still. Where do you live?

44:40.625 --> 44:41.791
I'll fetch you home.
Tell me your address

44:41.792 --> 44:43.249
I wanna go home...

44:43.250 --> 44:44.499
Where do you live?

44:45.125 --> 44:45.999
Sir...

44:46.208 --> 44:47.416
Where are you going?

44:47.708 --> 44:48.666
Tai Hang, please

44:49.625 --> 44:52.041
No, the closest hourly hotel

45:01.375 --> 45:02.291
Don't throw up...

45:03.417 --> 45:04.124
Watch out

45:06.500 --> 45:07.582
You hold it

45:10.750 --> 45:13.332
I always think you dislike me

45:13.500 --> 45:14.707
How would l dislike you?

45:16.167 --> 45:18.374
People look down on our job nature

45:19.208 --> 45:22.291
I'm nothing better than you,
I'm just a slave

45:23.500 --> 45:25.582
So both of us have mutual sympathy

45:29.500 --> 45:30.832
I really don't understand

45:31.667 --> 45:33.207
Why do people like to play?

45:35.167 --> 45:37.499
People say, man likes to play

45:37.833 --> 45:39.082
is for stimulation

45:39.583 --> 45:40.916
Woman likes to play

45:41.125 --> 45:42.166
cause they were stimulated

45:42.500 --> 45:43.749
So what stimulated you?

45:44.125 --> 45:44.957
I...

45:45.458 --> 45:46.582
am stimulated by money

45:46.708 --> 45:48.166
You need money urgently...

45:48.750 --> 45:50.207
Is your father sick?

45:50.458 --> 45:52.166
Or your brother needs to study?

45:52.750 --> 45:55.582
You are smart.
My father does have kidney disease

46:00.750 --> 46:02.791
May I lean on you for a while?
You don't mind, right?

46:16.250 --> 46:17.666
As a shepherd dog...

46:18.583 --> 46:20.541
I should be the greatest

46:50.875 --> 46:51.541
Let's eat

46:58.667 --> 47:00.082
It's uncle. l'll go there first

47:03.292 --> 47:08.832
Uncle

47:09.583 --> 47:10.166
What's the smell?

47:10.458 --> 47:11.374
Fermented bean curd

47:11.417 --> 47:12.291
Have one

47:12.292 --> 47:12.874
Throw it away

47:13.208 --> 47:13.832
Just one

47:13.875 --> 47:14.957
Don't make my car smell. Throw it away

47:15.125 --> 47:15.791
Throw it away

47:18.625 --> 47:19.499
You throw it on the street?

47:19.667 --> 47:20.832
You told me to

47:20.958 --> 47:21.791
Do you wanna caught by the police?

47:23.458 --> 47:24.707
How long have you
been seeing my daughter?

47:25.417 --> 47:26.332
Almost two months

47:26.333 --> 47:27.832
I played since I was 1 6

47:27.958 --> 47:29.332
I know very well how you guys play

47:29.750 --> 47:31.749
Don't tell me you gonna marry her
and have your child

47:32.542 --> 47:33.916
I really plan to do it, uncle

47:34.042 --> 47:34.957
Don't call me uncle

47:35.542 --> 47:37.374
Call me Mark, My name is Lui

47:37.542 --> 47:38.832
I really think that way, Mark Lui

47:39.417 --> 47:41.291
If you really think so,
I have two options for you

47:41.458 --> 47:42.041
One

47:42.625 --> 47:44.874
I'll ask my friend
Uncle Kwan to talk to you

47:45.250 --> 47:45.916
Two

47:47.292 --> 47:48.499
Take this cheque

47:49.708 --> 47:50.791
I'm in a rush. Get off the car

47:50.958 --> 47:51.582
Get off the car

48:13.250 --> 48:14.791
You don't have branded clothes

48:15.083 --> 48:17.041
No fine dining, no branded car

48:17.292 --> 48:17.999
Are you ok?

48:18.292 --> 48:19.666
I'm ok when I'm with you

48:20.042 --> 48:20.707
How about your father?

48:21.292 --> 48:22.666
Don't you want me to move in here?

48:23.167 --> 48:24.166
No

48:25.750 --> 48:28.374
You can stay as long as... you wish

49:48.333 --> 49:50.832
It's the 20 dollars of the Star of David

49:51.625 --> 49:52.582
Give it back to you

49:56.292 --> 49:56.874
Are you off?

49:57.792 --> 49:58.499
Yes

50:00.750 --> 50:01.499
That way?

50:03.458 --> 50:04.124
Yup

50:05.000 --> 50:05.749
Let's go together

50:08.208 --> 50:09.374
You're good on origami?

50:09.667 --> 50:11.582
Do you know how to make the Ninja Dart?

50:11.917 --> 50:12.499
Yes

50:15.458 --> 50:16.291
The octagon dart?

50:17.208 --> 50:18.041
Yes

50:19.625 --> 50:20.416
You know everything?

50:21.208 --> 50:22.041
Everything

50:24.542 --> 50:25.207
What's your name again?

50:28.750 --> 50:29.999
Sola Aoi

50:55.208 --> 50:56.416
Hi! Dim!

50:56.792 --> 50:58.124
Nice to meet you in here

50:58.792 --> 51:00.249
I organize this party

51:00.542 --> 51:01.291
And I bring a...

51:02.000 --> 51:04.582
Korean boy here to play

51:05.375 --> 51:07.166
Taking Korean Kimchi?

51:07.458 --> 51:10.124
Korean boy... is very nice

51:10.125 --> 51:10.707
Listen

51:11.333 --> 51:12.124
Massage!

51:14.250 --> 51:18.541
Massage...

51:19.833 --> 51:21.624
Kimchi!

51:26.208 --> 51:27.416
What does that mean?

51:28.000 --> 51:30.041
That means... get yourself wet

51:38.042 --> 51:38.791
I'll be back soon

51:39.000 --> 51:39.999
Ok

51:42.292 --> 51:42.916
What's up?

51:43.333 --> 51:44.374
You don't flirt with your phone anymore?

51:47.125 --> 51:50.582
She told me that she would come
to this party tonight

51:50.583 --> 51:51.791
And she said she would
give me back my phone

51:52.167 --> 51:53.916
The one over there is not bad

51:54.250 --> 51:55.791
Are you kidding?

51:58.875 --> 52:00.541
Titanic!

52:03.125 --> 52:04.957
Go get your Summer!

52:05.542 --> 52:08.166
I don't wanna say anymore.
I wanna sleep

52:08.167 --> 52:11.541
Please say it. The one you
said last time was funny

52:11.917 --> 52:13.374
Say it, say it!

52:13.458 --> 52:16.291
Ok... I'll say

52:16.292 --> 52:17.666
Long time ago, there is a boss

52:17.750 --> 52:20.541
His company earned big money
so he celebrated with his client

52:20.583 --> 52:24.457
Unexpectedly the boss was
too hyper and got drunk

52:27.625 --> 52:30.957
I want here to be full of
girls after an hour

52:31.125 --> 52:32.374
Cheers!

52:32.375 --> 52:35.041
After one hour,
the house was full of girls

52:35.125 --> 52:36.791
The number of girl was even
more than the number of guest

52:36.958 --> 52:40.166
One of the colleagues
was not looking happy

52:40.292 --> 52:42.166
Because he is Gay

52:42.333 --> 52:45.457
Instead, he is interested
in his colleagues' hip

52:48.500 --> 52:49.374
- Hi. - Hi.

52:49.500 --> 52:50.457
Hi.

52:50.583 --> 52:51.707
Hi...

52:51.708 --> 52:55.166
He didn't want his colleague to
know that he likes men

52:56.208 --> 52:58.582
So, he reluctantly touched a bit

52:58.625 --> 53:00.541
Then he thought of a way

53:00.708 --> 53:03.207
How about it. I'll give each of you
2 thousand dollars

53:03.333 --> 53:05.582
You don't have to do anything.
Just walk around with me

53:05.708 --> 53:08.832
Once we come back,
try all your effort to praise me

53:09.208 --> 53:09.791
Is it ok?

53:09.958 --> 53:10.999
Ok

53:11.250 --> 53:12.582
We don't need to do anything...
let's go!

53:12.583 --> 53:13.457
Go

53:15.250 --> 53:16.249
Say it...

53:16.375 --> 53:18.541
- You are so great
- Great, isn't it?

53:18.625 --> 53:19.957
Let's do it again

53:19.958 --> 53:20.874
You feel great, right?

53:21.042 --> 53:22.666
He didn't expect the news spread

53:22.833 --> 53:24.916
and all the girls rushed to him

53:26.250 --> 53:28.041
I heard that you are great

53:28.042 --> 53:30.832
I want it, too...

53:31.000 --> 53:34.916
Since then, he could never show up
in any Bar for gay people

53:35.042 --> 53:37.124
Because everyone thinks
he likes prostitutes

53:37.208 --> 53:39.291
So I can never flirt with boys anymore

53:46.083 --> 53:46.707
Hello?

53:46.917 --> 53:48.791
Hi! Dicky. It's Siri

53:49.000 --> 53:50.124
Do you want to play me?

53:50.250 --> 53:53.666
You really want to see me
and give me back my mobile yourself?

53:53.833 --> 53:56.707
I've told you I want to meet you
and give you back your mobile myself

53:57.542 --> 53:59.374
Good. Grand you a wish

53:59.708 --> 54:01.582
Ok! Time, place,
how much you could show?

54:01.833 --> 54:05.874
I don't like men who
rushes and not appealing

54:06.167 --> 54:08.999
Maybe l describe how do I look first

54:09.542 --> 54:11.999
I don't like to be tied up by bra

54:12.375 --> 54:14.291
I like being kissed on my ears

54:14.458 --> 54:16.041
Keep kissing, keep kissing...

54:16.292 --> 54:19.874
Kiss my neck, then kiss downwards...

54:20.000 --> 54:23.082
Kiss my belly button, going downwards...

54:23.333 --> 54:24.582
Downwards...

54:25.750 --> 54:27.082
What a coincident

54:27.667 --> 54:28.499
It's you again?

54:31.417 --> 54:33.791
Dlcky, how come your voice has changed?

54:34.125 --> 54:34.916
What are you doing here?

54:36.375 --> 54:37.166
Are you still talking to the phone?

54:39.292 --> 54:41.874
This phone call is very important.
It could make several billion difference

54:42.375 --> 54:43.124
Go on

54:45.042 --> 54:47.332
My most sensitive part is my ankle

54:47.417 --> 54:48.582
Are you sick?

54:48.750 --> 54:49.999
You play Phone-sex?

54:50.500 --> 54:51.874
You may just get an inflated doll

54:52.042 --> 54:53.874
You could take that
several billion yourself

54:56.083 --> 54:57.916
Shit! Crazy!

55:02.083 --> 55:02.874
That wet...

55:03.792 --> 55:04.916
It must be out of order

55:05.708 --> 55:07.457
How can l see my goddess?

55:22.083 --> 55:22.874
Siri!

55:23.500 --> 55:25.749
Dick-Dick, where is my phone?

55:28.875 --> 55:30.582
I'm sorry. l've made it wet

55:30.917 --> 55:31.874
I can buy you a new one

55:36.083 --> 55:37.457
And now the phone is not working

55:37.750 --> 55:39.041
and the pictures were gone.
How can you repay me?

55:40.500 --> 55:41.457
I can...

55:41.875 --> 55:42.957
take it with you at most...

55:43.250 --> 55:43.874
Ok

55:44.625 --> 55:45.332
Let's do it together

55:45.500 --> 55:46.166
Now?

55:46.917 --> 55:48.124
It's the year of 201 2

55:49.167 --> 55:50.332
What are you waiting for?

56:01.958 --> 56:04.457
Stop drinking. I don't want to see you
throw up in the pool

56:04.458 --> 56:06.541
Excuse me, miss.
This card is not working

56:06.625 --> 56:08.041
Do you have another one?

56:08.750 --> 56:11.749
Your cards are not working.
Is it something wrong with the bank?

56:13.667 --> 56:14.666
Use mine

56:14.833 --> 56:15.541
Thank you.

56:16.750 --> 56:19.082
I'm sorry. lt should be my treat

56:19.292 --> 56:20.457
It's fine. No problem.

56:20.500 --> 56:21.291
Cheers...

56:21.292 --> 56:22.082
Cheers

56:31.417 --> 56:32.249
Are you kidding?

56:33.000 --> 56:34.041
You plan to do it here?

56:34.750 --> 56:35.374
You don't have the guts?

56:35.833 --> 56:36.624
Then I'm leaving

56:37.708 --> 56:38.499
Don't go

58:06.458 --> 58:07.332
Can l contact you again?

58:07.542 --> 58:09.749
Don't you know the meaning
of Casual Sex?

58:11.583 --> 58:15.916
Actually, I was a LKF USB

58:16.250 --> 58:19.374
But... it's hard to find
a partner of that quality

59:26.375 --> 59:27.416
Feel free to walk around

59:29.542 --> 59:30.999
This place is big!

59:41.917 --> 59:43.624
This place is big. Do you like it?

59:44.375 --> 59:45.041

59:46.667 --> 59:49.041
Places of that big
is wonderful for a studio

59:49.792 --> 59:51.582
I plan to make a room here

59:51.667 --> 59:53.666
Just like now so that l can sleep here

59:54.500 --> 59:56.082
You sleep here. How about me?

59:56.958 --> 59:57.999
Aren't we together?

59:58.458 --> 01:00:00.332
What? What are you thinking?

01:00:00.333 --> 01:00:01.124
Naughty

01:00:01.333 --> 01:00:03.207
Me? You were thinking. Naughty girl

01:00:03.250 --> 01:00:04.624
- I didn't! - You didn't?

01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:07.082
If you two like it here

01:00:07.083 --> 01:00:08.582
why don't you buy it sooner

01:00:09.375 --> 01:00:10.707
I will buy it

01:00:10.792 --> 01:00:11.582
Thanks two of you!

01:00:11.667 --> 01:00:12.582
After one year

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:13.499
Huh?

01:00:13.833 --> 01:00:14.832
I mean it

01:00:15.583 --> 01:00:16.832
Ok

01:00:16.958 --> 01:00:20.166
Remember to keep it for us

01:00:23.208 --> 01:00:23.957
CK?

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:27.291
What?

01:00:28.583 --> 01:00:29.791
Ok, l'll be right back

01:00:30.417 --> 01:00:30.999
What's up?

01:00:31.167 --> 01:00:31.957
Sorry, dear

01:00:32.125 --> 01:00:33.874
CK has something urgent. l need to
get back to the studio right now

01:00:34.167 --> 01:00:35.041
Hey...

01:00:35.708 --> 01:00:37.374
What happened? Tell me

01:00:38.833 --> 01:00:39.999
Who are you looking for?

01:00:40.292 --> 01:00:41.582
What do you mean by doing that?

01:00:41.708 --> 01:00:43.249
Do you need to do this nasty thing?

01:00:44.125 --> 01:00:45.374
Come in and talk

01:00:46.042 --> 01:00:47.291
What are you talking about?

01:00:47.417 --> 01:00:48.957
I have no idea on what
you're talking about

01:00:49.083 --> 01:00:49.999
You don't have to play innocent

01:00:50.125 --> 01:00:52.207
I know you have connection with
several advertising company

01:00:52.292 --> 01:00:53.874
It's you who told them
to cut CK's projects

01:00:53.875 --> 01:00:55.749
and made Rain and others
lose their job. Did you?

01:00:55.958 --> 01:00:57.082
Summer, yes

01:00:57.292 --> 01:00:59.082
We did have some argument before

01:00:59.292 --> 01:01:01.249
This is between two of us

01:01:01.417 --> 01:01:03.082
Let by gone be by gone

01:01:03.917 --> 01:01:05.666
Actually, I still care about you

01:01:05.792 --> 01:01:07.291
I really wouldn't do it

01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:09.082
If it's not you. Who would that be?

01:01:12.458 --> 01:01:14.541
Maybe Raymond and his friend

01:01:14.917 --> 01:01:16.416
They were bastards!

01:01:16.917 --> 01:01:18.291
I swear to god

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.249
that it's not me

01:01:21.208 --> 01:01:21.957
I shall go then

01:01:22.042 --> 01:01:23.041
Summer, wait.

01:01:25.167 --> 01:01:28.249
I heard that you've quarreled
with uncle and moved out

01:01:28.833 --> 01:01:30.499
He makes economic blockade to you

01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:32.082
and your boyfriend is
also short of money

01:01:32.083 --> 01:01:33.999
Thanks for your caring.
We'll take care of it ourselves

01:01:34.125 --> 01:01:34.791
Listen

01:01:34.917 --> 01:01:37.249
My friend has few stores
and he wants to sell them

01:01:37.333 --> 01:01:38.707
I can't find any buyer yet

01:01:38.792 --> 01:01:41.499
You know a lot of people
including some from mainland

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:44.374
Please consider helping me
and introduce some to me

01:01:44.833 --> 01:01:46.957
But I don't know anything
about property selling

01:01:46.958 --> 01:01:48.166
It needs license

01:01:48.292 --> 01:01:51.082
I'll find an agent to follow up
regarding documentation

01:01:51.292 --> 01:01:54.082
You just need to ask your friends
out to play and drink

01:01:54.292 --> 01:01:55.749
You can sell them then

01:01:56.083 --> 01:01:58.166
It just need some social skill
that shouldn't bother you

01:01:58.375 --> 01:01:59.457
Think about it

01:02:00.167 --> 01:02:02.291
If it's ok, we can have more than
a million commission

01:02:02.542 --> 01:02:03.707
I'm gonna get you something to drink

01:02:09.042 --> 01:02:09.916
God?

01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:11.291
I believe in Buddha

01:02:25.292 --> 01:02:27.832
Do you know how to make the ninja dart?

01:02:28.458 --> 01:02:29.207
Yes

01:02:45.417 --> 01:02:46.082
Why are you smiling?

01:02:49.792 --> 01:02:51.082
Crazy

01:02:55.917 --> 01:02:56.666
Cheers!

01:02:56.667 --> 01:02:57.957
Cheers...

01:02:58.208 --> 01:03:00.666
Thomas, did you say you want to
develop your business in Hong Kong?

01:03:00.667 --> 01:03:01.291
Yes

01:03:01.333 --> 01:03:02.582
My friend has a few stores

01:03:02.583 --> 01:03:04.707
I can liaise with him if you need it

01:03:04.792 --> 01:03:05.791
Ok...

01:03:05.792 --> 01:03:08.124
But I'm here just for fun tonight

01:03:08.125 --> 01:03:10.707
- Let's talk about business later
- Cheers...

01:03:10.708 --> 01:03:11.499
How about me?

01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:13.374
Cheers! Cheers...

01:03:13.375 --> 01:03:14.666
You're so stingy

01:03:17.708 --> 01:03:18.624
Just a minute...

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.916
I shall make a call. Drink more

01:03:22.083 --> 01:03:23.374
I'll be back soon

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.166
Hello?

01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:32.166
Summer?

01:03:33.042 --> 01:03:34.666
I don't feel well tonight

01:03:34.958 --> 01:03:36.082
Come and accompany me

01:03:36.708 --> 01:03:40.124
If you don't feel well, then don't play
and don't drink that often, would you?

01:03:40.708 --> 01:03:42.166
- Handsome... - I'm not you

01:03:42.208 --> 01:03:43.332
I need to work

01:03:43.333 --> 01:03:44.041
What's up?

01:03:44.042 --> 01:03:46.416
Guess if we put a condom on a rice roll

01:03:46.417 --> 01:03:47.416
what would it become?

01:03:47.625 --> 01:03:49.707
Make a guess

01:03:49.917 --> 01:03:52.249
Is your work more important
or I am more important?

01:03:52.417 --> 01:03:54.707
I work for us!

01:03:55.042 --> 01:03:55.957
I can't talk. l need to work

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:57.916
What's up?

01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.332
When we put condom on rice roll

01:03:59.333 --> 01:04:01.082
It'll become glutinous rice roll

01:04:02.542 --> 01:04:03.624
Crazy

01:04:04.083 --> 01:04:05.249
Let's drink some more!

01:04:05.250 --> 01:04:06.291
Cheers!

01:04:06.292 --> 01:04:08.041
Cheers...

01:04:12.667 --> 01:04:13.957
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

01:04:16.208 --> 01:04:17.791
Thomas, Hong, go on

01:04:17.792 --> 01:04:18.582
Come on, go on...

01:04:18.583 --> 01:04:19.499
Cheers!

01:04:22.167 --> 01:04:23.249
You've drunk too much

01:04:23.583 --> 01:04:24.666
Are you ok?

01:04:24.667 --> 01:04:25.999
I need some rest, l need some rest...

01:04:27.833 --> 01:04:29.916
How are you?

01:04:30.250 --> 01:04:33.999
We... change to another place
and continue

01:04:34.667 --> 01:04:36.999
I'll fetch you home

01:04:38.208 --> 01:04:40.416
Ok, we'll go some other place...

01:04:40.417 --> 01:04:41.124
Excuse me

01:04:41.125 --> 01:04:41.832

01:04:42.667 --> 01:04:44.166

01:04:55.917 --> 01:04:56.499
Hello?

01:04:56.917 --> 01:04:59.082
Rain, l saw Summer was drunk just now

01:04:59.083 --> 01:05:00.457
She was fetched by a man

01:05:01.458 --> 01:05:02.457
I'll be right there!

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:14.082
Go on!

01:05:20.167 --> 01:05:23.166
Driver, please speed up.
I have something urgent

01:05:23.417 --> 01:05:25.666
It's already very fast, buddy

01:06:01.583 --> 01:06:02.332
What are you doing?

01:06:02.750 --> 01:06:03.749
What is this place?

01:06:03.875 --> 01:06:05.999
Don't worry. We've done all these before

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:06.874
You're crazy

01:06:07.208 --> 01:06:08.999
Don't touch me. Go away!

01:06:09.042 --> 01:06:10.999
Come on! You used to like it

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:11.832
Let me go!

01:06:11.833 --> 01:06:12.707
Let me go...

01:06:12.708 --> 01:06:14.291
Maxim, where is Summer?

01:06:15.458 --> 01:06:17.749
I don't know. How come you took so long?

01:06:36.542 --> 01:06:39.541
Miss Lui is fine.
She is pregnant for one month

01:06:39.708 --> 01:06:40.666
The embryo is miscarried

01:06:41.250 --> 01:06:42.374
Give her more care

01:06:43.875 --> 01:06:44.624
Thanks, doctor

01:06:52.458 --> 01:06:53.582
Didn't l tell you!

01:06:59.333 --> 01:07:01.166
Stop! This is a hospital!

01:07:32.417 --> 01:07:33.249
How are you?

01:07:34.208 --> 01:07:35.041
I'm sorry

01:07:36.917 --> 01:07:39.624
Play! l've told you stop playing

01:07:39.708 --> 01:07:40.791
but you insisted

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.166
No...

01:07:42.708 --> 01:07:46.124
You like to play, you like to go out
and keep yourself drunk

01:07:46.375 --> 01:07:48.207
You even didn't tell me you're pregnant

01:07:48.208 --> 01:07:49.707
- No... - And now it's miscarried!

01:07:50.208 --> 01:07:51.666
- No... - What do you mean by no?

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:55.707
I don't know how to
take care of you any more

01:07:56.542 --> 01:07:58.999
I really can't understand
why did you go to hotel with him?

01:07:59.250 --> 01:08:01.332
I know I'm poor l'm not promising

01:08:01.458 --> 01:08:02.666
I can't really take care of you

01:08:03.208 --> 01:08:04.124
You take care yourself

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:19.249
Let's drink again next time

01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:21.666
Bye!

01:08:31.375 --> 01:08:33.374
Bastard!

01:08:33.542 --> 01:08:35.291
I'm already a bastard
and you're even worse than me

01:08:35.625 --> 01:08:36.499
Go to hell!

01:08:39.582 --> 01:08:40.374
Let's go!

01:08:40.792 --> 01:08:41.291
That's enough!

01:08:41.292 --> 01:08:42.207
Go...

01:08:43.917 --> 01:08:45.374
Let's go! Still beating?

01:08:45.832 --> 01:08:46.624
Let's go!

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:48.582
Hey!

01:08:53.957 --> 01:08:54.957
He must be beaten to death

01:08:55.667 --> 01:08:56.416
What?

01:08:57.042 --> 01:08:58.541
You know them? Stand over there!

01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:00.249
Go over there!

01:09:01.375 --> 01:09:02.082
Miss!

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:03.124
Do you know him?

01:09:03.542 --> 01:09:04.332
Go over there!

01:09:05.082 --> 01:09:06.707
I told you to go over there!

01:09:07.542 --> 01:09:08.624
Go over there!

01:09:16.707 --> 01:09:18.416
Officer, look!

01:09:18.582 --> 01:09:19.541
What to do now?

01:09:19.707 --> 01:09:21.332
Did you see who had beaten you?

01:09:21.417 --> 01:09:22.957
My head was covered. How would I know?

01:09:24.207 --> 01:09:26.166
Officer, the injured said
he was being beaten

01:09:26.207 --> 01:09:28.791
But his head was covered
and he could see nothing

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:30.707
We've grabbed 4 people

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:32.207
But they said they don't know nothing

01:09:32.750 --> 01:09:34.374
Did you guys see anything
when you petrol?

01:09:35.667 --> 01:09:36.666
We're in trouble this time

01:09:37.667 --> 01:09:38.374
We're dead

01:09:39.042 --> 01:09:41.332
We've beaten him to this level.
He must sue us

01:09:41.582 --> 01:09:44.416
The worst thing is this officer saw us

01:09:45.832 --> 01:09:48.332
We've fucked up.
Do we need to go to jail?

01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:53.416
Don't worry

01:09:53.417 --> 01:09:55.749
- I don't wanna go to jail
- Calm down

01:09:56.833 --> 01:09:58.791
Officer told us to go to the police
station first. All get into the car

01:09:58.875 --> 01:10:01.082
Get in the car! Get up...
Get in the car!

01:10:02.750 --> 01:10:03.666
Be quick, be quick

01:10:06.792 --> 01:10:07.541
Get up

01:10:09.417 --> 01:10:10.000
What are you doing?

01:10:45.875 --> 01:10:48.082
Ok, raise your head

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:50.957
You're better looking than your elder sister.
At this angle

01:10:51.167 --> 01:10:52.499
- You're kidding...

01:10:54.167 --> 01:10:55.291

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:05.457
Can l ask Rain to do it next time?

01:11:05.708 --> 01:11:06.416

01:11:06.417 --> 01:11:07.332
Thank you. I go get changed first

01:11:15.417 --> 01:11:16.082

01:11:16.917 --> 01:11:17.874
You're good

01:11:21.875 --> 01:11:23.291
Fighting

01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:34.999
I wanna tell you

01:11:35.458 --> 01:11:37.291
that l really don't know I'm pregnant

01:11:38.458 --> 01:11:39.874
Let by gone be by gone

01:11:40.833 --> 01:11:41.666
We can't go back

01:11:42.458 --> 01:11:43.916
Hey...

01:11:44.375 --> 01:11:45.832
Hey... don't go

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:46.916
Why?

01:11:47.125 --> 01:11:48.416
Stop!

01:11:49.583 --> 01:11:50.332
Why?

01:11:51.125 --> 01:11:51.999
I don't have money

01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:54.707
I don't have car, I don't have house.

01:11:54.792 --> 01:11:55.874
I don't know English

01:11:56.375 --> 01:11:57.416
I don't know how to play

01:11:58.042 --> 01:11:59.332
I don't care.

01:11:59.750 --> 01:12:00.666
I do care.

01:12:01.375 --> 01:12:03.624
Your friends care,
you father care even more!

01:12:04.833 --> 01:12:06.041
I can't hear you!

01:12:06.583 --> 01:12:07.582
Would you stop for a while?

01:12:07.583 --> 01:12:08.666
Crazy!

01:12:08.917 --> 01:12:09.582
You want me to kick your ass!

01:12:09.667 --> 01:12:10.416
Come on!

01:12:10.542 --> 01:12:11.457
What did you say?

01:12:11.542 --> 01:12:13.582
Sorry... he's drunk

01:12:14.917 --> 01:12:18.499
The youth thinks they are so great
when they argue on the street

01:12:22.375 --> 01:12:23.249
Hey!

01:12:24.417 --> 01:12:26.582
Listen to me

01:12:26.917 --> 01:12:27.832
Hey!

01:12:28.333 --> 01:12:30.082
Hey... please wait for me!

01:12:30.458 --> 01:12:31.291
Hey!

01:12:36.917 --> 01:12:38.749
Hey! Hey...

01:12:39.542 --> 01:12:40.832
Say something

01:12:42.417 --> 01:12:43.582
Your father is right

01:12:44.375 --> 01:12:45.999
I don't care how other people sees it

01:12:46.125 --> 01:12:47.791
But how can you look down on yourself?

01:12:47.875 --> 01:12:49.416
The Rain I know is not like that

01:12:50.208 --> 01:12:51.249
So what should he be?

01:12:52.958 --> 01:12:54.666
Being teased that
I can't afford to be with you,

01:12:54.917 --> 01:12:55.999
yet pretending hearing nothing?

01:12:56.917 --> 01:12:57.957
Or I shall be like you...

01:12:58.375 --> 01:13:00.082
Play until I lose our baby?

01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:07.541
Do you want to slap the other side, too?

01:13:09.417 --> 01:13:10.749
I am so disappointed!

01:13:10.917 --> 01:13:12.416
I don't want to see you again!

01:13:12.542 --> 01:13:13.166
Great!

01:13:14.042 --> 01:13:14.874
You keep playing!

01:13:15.292 --> 01:13:16.249
and being played!

01:13:17.917 --> 01:13:19.582
Go away! Pauper!

01:13:20.333 --> 01:13:21.207
Go!

01:13:36.458 --> 01:13:38.791
I'm so happy that
you are here to accompany me

01:13:39.542 --> 01:13:40.457
Come over

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:42.249
A kiss...

01:13:43.042 --> 01:13:45.207
Senior, there are a lot of strange
happenings in the night club

01:13:46.125 --> 01:13:46.957
Look over there

01:13:50.833 --> 01:13:51.749
Don't be mad

01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.291
That boy is so skinny
yet he had two girls

01:13:54.292 --> 01:13:55.457
Can he bear this?

01:13:55.542 --> 01:13:56.541
Boy?

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.041
That guy has breast

01:13:59.375 --> 01:14:00.582
T... Tom Boy?

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:06.999
Let's cheers

01:14:13.917 --> 01:14:16.124
It's time to let go.
Why you still bother?

01:14:17.042 --> 01:14:19.249
It's frustrated to have one
and frustrated not to have one. You know

01:14:19.583 --> 01:14:21.416
I know that. We are man

01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:22.874
In one word...

01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:25.082
Anyway, when we have a woman,
we're difficult

01:14:25.292 --> 01:14:26.291
When we don't have...

01:14:26.708 --> 01:14:28.082
Willy is difficult

01:14:29.167 --> 01:14:31.916
No wonder your willy is that difficult

01:14:34.583 --> 01:14:37.416
Frankly, there are
a lot of women in here...

01:14:37.417 --> 01:14:39.541
I don't think no one
is better than Summer

01:14:42.708 --> 01:14:45.791
As it's you, I'll pick the best for you

01:14:46.542 --> 01:14:48.082
Don't go away and wait in here

01:15:08.083 --> 01:15:08.707
Rain

01:15:11.667 --> 01:15:13.291
Let me introduce you

01:15:13.958 --> 01:15:15.791
Top model from Korea EJ.

01:15:16.208 --> 01:15:17.541
Korea top model

01:15:18.833 --> 01:15:19.499
Rain

01:15:20.167 --> 01:15:21.166
How are you, Rain?

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:22.249
Hi!

01:15:24.417 --> 01:15:26.041
Don't act like a stupid

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:28.832
Thank you

01:15:29.167 --> 01:15:30.124
Come on! Cheers!

01:15:30.167 --> 01:15:31.166
- Cheers... - Cheers!

01:15:38.875 --> 01:15:40.791
Leave the girls unattended is a sin

01:15:41.125 --> 01:15:42.082
You go

01:15:42.292 --> 01:15:44.041
Are you really not going?
I'll go if you don't

01:15:44.042 --> 01:15:44.999
I'll leave you alone

01:15:46.667 --> 01:15:47.416
Siri?

01:15:48.167 --> 01:15:49.041
Do you want to shoot tonight?

01:15:49.125 --> 01:15:49.791
Got struck?

01:15:50.292 --> 01:15:52.624
Hey! Are you playing me?

01:15:54.458 --> 01:15:55.124
Sorry.

01:15:55.583 --> 01:15:56.374
Actually...

01:15:56.958 --> 01:15:58.124
I don't like man

01:15:58.208 --> 01:15:59.249
I like woman

01:15:59.458 --> 01:16:00.124
Save it

01:16:06.167 --> 01:16:08.541
Siri, where will you bring me this time?

01:17:52.292 --> 01:17:54.416
You make me very happy every time

01:17:54.750 --> 01:17:55.457
Thank you

01:17:57.083 --> 01:17:57.666
I love you!

01:17:57.750 --> 01:17:58.499
What?

01:17:59.083 --> 01:17:59.666
I love you!

01:17:59.917 --> 01:18:00.832
What did you say?

01:18:01.167 --> 01:18:01.916
I love you!

01:18:16.208 --> 01:18:16.874
What's up?

01:18:17.292 --> 01:18:18.082
You lie to me!

01:18:18.375 --> 01:18:19.249
How did l lie to you?

01:18:19.667 --> 01:18:21.541
Do you still remember
you said you just want sex

01:18:22.500 --> 01:18:24.291
And sex creates love. Does it good?

01:18:25.917 --> 01:18:26.874
You lied!

01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:29.041
You lied to me!

01:18:30.708 --> 01:18:32.374
You have love when you made love to me

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:34.207
means you lied

01:18:34.917 --> 01:18:37.624
It's unfair. Unfair

01:18:38.833 --> 01:18:40.499
What l said were the truth

01:18:40.708 --> 01:18:41.749
Does it call lie?

01:18:42.833 --> 01:18:43.874
You don't understand!

01:18:45.167 --> 01:18:46.999
I don't understand. Then say it clearly!

01:18:48.167 --> 01:18:49.207
I'm married

01:18:54.042 --> 01:18:54.874
You are kidding

01:18:55.083 --> 01:18:57.291
You don't like me so you lie to me

01:19:06.833 --> 01:19:08.707
If you play, you should know him

01:19:10.167 --> 01:19:12.374
Are you kidding?
This bastard is your husband?

01:19:13.708 --> 01:19:15.541
I married to my husband
when I was very young

01:19:16.083 --> 01:19:17.957
It's a political marriage
between two families

01:19:18.375 --> 01:19:20.832
We don't have love but properties

01:19:21.125 --> 01:19:23.291
He plays his and I play mine

01:19:23.583 --> 01:19:25.374
Good, so...

01:19:25.500 --> 01:19:27.791
You leave this bastard and stay with me

01:19:29.667 --> 01:19:31.582
I admit that I like you in some way

01:19:32.208 --> 01:19:33.666
But I won't forfeit...

01:19:34.375 --> 01:19:35.916
my current life because of you

01:19:37.542 --> 01:19:38.957
It's also for yourself

01:19:39.292 --> 01:19:41.749
I didn't expect l'll fall
in love in the beginning

01:19:43.208 --> 01:19:45.207
Does money that important to you?

01:19:45.458 --> 01:19:47.207
I'll give you one last chance

01:19:47.542 --> 01:19:50.332
If you promise me that
next time when we meet

01:19:50.625 --> 01:19:54.082
We just have sex. How's it?

01:19:58.333 --> 01:20:00.624
No way... I like you...

01:20:00.792 --> 01:20:02.582
I love you!

01:20:04.208 --> 01:20:05.624
You get out!

01:20:07.292 --> 01:20:08.416
- What's up? - Get out!

01:20:08.708 --> 01:20:09.499
What's up?

01:20:10.917 --> 01:20:11.874
Get out!

01:20:12.375 --> 01:20:13.791
I don't want to see you anymore!

01:20:17.333 --> 01:20:22.832
Siri! Siri!

01:21:16.292 --> 01:21:17.957
Father. Take care

01:21:18.625 --> 01:21:19.874
Take care. Ok?

01:21:20.083 --> 01:21:21.041
Take it slow

01:21:22.125 --> 01:21:23.416
Is your father sick?

01:21:23.792 --> 01:21:25.541
Or your brother needs to study?

01:21:25.917 --> 01:21:28.749
You are really smart.
My father does have kidney disease

01:21:52.500 --> 01:21:53.957
All officers are bad guys!

01:22:12.042 --> 01:22:13.999
You are late... today

01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:16.332
So... one glass as penalty

01:22:17.208 --> 01:22:19.999
But... l don't want to
drink champagne tonight

01:22:21.292 --> 01:22:22.791
I'd like to have white wine more

01:22:23.208 --> 01:22:24.666
White wine!

01:22:25.958 --> 01:22:26.749
White wine

01:22:26.750 --> 01:22:29.166
I do... want to serve you

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:32.791
I'll give you whatever
wine you want to drink

01:22:32.792 --> 01:22:33.707
Great

01:22:35.250 --> 01:22:36.166
A toast to you

01:22:37.833 --> 01:22:38.416
Bottoms up

01:22:38.583 --> 01:22:39.249
Don't drink!

01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:43.499
Hey, what are you doing?

01:22:44.417 --> 01:22:47.082
My friend... proposed a toast to her

01:22:47.167 --> 01:22:48.082
Are you revolting?

01:22:49.958 --> 01:22:51.666
Don't be angry...

01:22:51.667 --> 01:22:52.416
Sit down!

01:22:53.917 --> 01:22:54.832
Is she...

01:22:55.292 --> 01:22:56.416
your girlfriend now?

01:22:58.875 --> 01:22:59.707
Fuck you!

01:22:59.833 --> 01:23:01.041
I've been holding back for a long time!

01:23:01.708 --> 01:23:02.791
I saw you put the drugs in!

01:23:04.292 --> 01:23:04.999
Let's go!

01:23:07.667 --> 01:23:09.374
You dare to splash me the wine?!

01:23:10.833 --> 01:23:12.541
You don't need to
come back to work tomorrow!

01:23:12.542 --> 01:23:14.082
You're fire!

01:23:14.792 --> 01:23:16.416
When did l put the drug in?

01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:18.207
I never put any drug in!

01:23:26.250 --> 01:23:26.999
Hey!

01:23:28.375 --> 01:23:30.874
Maybe we go back now
and apologize to them

01:23:31.083 --> 01:23:32.124
No way

01:23:32.208 --> 01:23:32.957
Please

01:23:33.792 --> 01:23:35.707
If we go back now...

01:23:35.750 --> 01:23:38.499
They may not fire you, right?

01:23:38.833 --> 01:23:39.791
Or...

01:23:40.708 --> 01:23:41.957
I stay with him for few nights

01:23:41.958 --> 01:23:42.874
Enough!

01:23:44.542 --> 01:23:46.957
I really don't worth you
to do this to me

01:23:46.958 --> 01:23:48.291
Do you understand?

01:23:48.583 --> 01:23:51.041
You're not born to
be a private prostitute

01:23:51.542 --> 01:23:53.832
Why do we need to
please those bastards?

01:23:54.208 --> 01:23:55.874
They can get whatever they want

01:23:55.875 --> 01:23:57.124
They can do whatever they want

01:23:57.708 --> 01:23:58.457
But me...

01:23:59.083 --> 01:24:01.082
I gotta see how they play you

01:24:01.167 --> 01:24:02.832
Why? Why?

01:24:03.500 --> 01:24:04.791
Why?

01:24:06.958 --> 01:24:08.291
See how much you look like a dog!

01:24:09.167 --> 01:24:10.374
See how ugly you are!

01:24:12.667 --> 01:24:14.332
Are you ok?

01:24:14.458 --> 01:24:15.749
I'm fine... I'm fine

01:24:16.833 --> 01:24:18.124
Go now

01:24:18.750 --> 01:24:20.332
You wanna get caught?

01:26:04.792 --> 01:26:05.457
QQ!

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:07.749
Would you stay?

01:26:09.375 --> 01:26:10.666
Don't you mind?

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:12.832
Let's stay together

01:26:14.250 --> 01:26:15.624
You're so silly

01:26:33.708 --> 01:26:34.999
Is it really no way to remedy?

01:26:35.417 --> 01:26:36.791
It's meaningless even so

01:26:40.583 --> 01:26:41.124
Hello?

01:26:41.125 --> 01:26:42.874
Avis, come in now!

01:26:42.875 --> 01:26:43.499
Ok

01:26:44.750 --> 01:26:45.624
Time to die

01:26:57.125 --> 01:26:58.916
Hey...

01:26:59.833 --> 01:27:01.291
Make me a cup of ginseng tea

01:27:01.708 --> 01:27:06.999
I'm getting old.
Just a bit alcohol makes me headache

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:08.707
Did you fetch me home last night?

01:27:09.167 --> 01:27:10.541
Chef Hung, you've forgotten
that last night...

01:27:11.625 --> 01:27:14.791
Last night... l've forgotten everything

01:27:15.083 --> 01:27:17.999
What? Did l do something wrong...
and got something bad?

01:27:18.042 --> 01:27:19.332
Nothing, nothing

01:27:19.333 --> 01:27:21.916
If there is something, just wipe it off

01:27:22.167 --> 01:27:23.666
Never tell

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:25.957
Understand. I won't utter a word

01:27:26.417 --> 01:27:27.457
Bastard

01:27:28.208 --> 01:27:31.916
Didn't waste those years of serving me.
You worth a promotion

01:27:33.625 --> 01:27:34.582
Promotion?

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.499
What? Do you think l'm firing you?

01:27:37.958 --> 01:27:39.999
Thanks, Chef Hung! Thanks, Chef Hung!

01:27:40.250 --> 01:27:44.291
As of tomorrow,
train few more guys for me

01:27:44.500 --> 01:27:45.832
and help me to earn more money

01:27:45.958 --> 01:27:47.582
No problem, of course!
No problem, of course!

01:27:48.417 --> 01:27:49.249
And...

01:27:49.875 --> 01:27:51.832
Ginseng tea, ginseng tea

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:53.082
Be right there! Be right there!

01:27:56.458 --> 01:27:57.207
Yes!

01:28:15.542 --> 01:28:16.541
It's not me

01:28:18.125 --> 01:28:19.207
I didn't betray you

01:28:22.375 --> 01:28:23.291
I know

01:28:23.958 --> 01:28:25.291
The police didn't catch me

01:28:29.375 --> 01:28:30.166
So...

01:28:31.167 --> 01:28:32.499
Can we still be friends?

01:28:34.625 --> 01:28:36.041
Do you know how to make horse?

01:28:37.792 --> 01:28:38.499
Yes

01:28:40.167 --> 01:28:41.791
You know how to make eagle?

01:28:42.958 --> 01:28:43.666
Yes

01:28:45.625 --> 01:28:47.499
You know how to make dog?

01:28:47.917 --> 01:28:48.582
Yes as well

01:28:50.042 --> 01:28:51.916
You know how to make... Kiss?

01:28:53.333 --> 01:28:54.124
Yes

01:29:15.875 --> 01:29:17.749
Good, groom...

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:19.416
More intimate, sweeter

01:29:19.583 --> 01:29:20.791
Hold your wife tight

01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:22.499
Good, very nice. More intimate

01:29:22.958 --> 01:29:24.582
Rain, shall we let him hold me?

01:29:24.583 --> 01:29:25.166
Ok

01:29:25.583 --> 01:29:26.374
I don't think so

01:29:27.250 --> 01:29:28.499
You're too heavy

01:29:28.667 --> 01:29:30.999
Be careful, don't make me fall

01:29:33.458 --> 01:29:34.791
You guys take some rest

01:29:34.792 --> 01:29:36.124
Get changed. We shall continue later

01:29:39.708 --> 01:29:41.082
You want to give up like this?

01:29:43.083 --> 01:29:44.749
We are people of two different worlds

01:29:46.042 --> 01:29:48.291
We won't have a future even
we managed to be together

01:29:49.042 --> 01:29:52.499
You knew it when you pursued her

01:29:53.125 --> 01:29:54.791
I really thought she'll be with me

01:29:55.708 --> 01:29:59.124
Frankly, I tried my best
to give whatever she wanted

01:29:59.292 --> 01:30:00.666
But it's only me that kept trying

01:30:00.917 --> 01:30:02.124
I also felt difficult

01:30:02.417 --> 01:30:04.624
You're the only one that tried? You're
the only one that felt difficult?

01:30:04.833 --> 01:30:06.791
Do you think Summer went to
Lang Kwai Fong...

01:30:06.792 --> 01:30:08.374
the night of the incident for fun?

01:30:14.125 --> 01:30:14.874
Summer!

01:30:16.708 --> 01:30:18.416
Come out, Summer. I know you're home

01:30:18.542 --> 01:30:19.874
I have something urgent to tell you

01:30:21.125 --> 01:30:21.874
Summer!

01:30:22.958 --> 01:30:24.749
Miss is sick and she is asleep

01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:26.124
Don't wake her up

01:30:26.333 --> 01:30:27.582
I know she's here

01:30:28.042 --> 01:30:30.249
Summer. I really have something
to say to you,

01:30:30.250 --> 01:30:30.957
please come out

01:30:31.292 --> 01:30:32.457
Would you come out, please?

01:30:36.792 --> 01:30:39.916
Summer

01:30:40.625 --> 01:30:41.707
It were you who said...

01:30:42.083 --> 01:30:44.749
things passed cannot be return

01:30:44.917 --> 01:30:45.624
Trust me.

01:30:46.250 --> 01:30:49.207
I promise, We must be able to
go back the old times

01:30:50.125 --> 01:30:51.832
We must be able to be even better

01:30:52.500 --> 01:30:53.707
Why didn't you trust me that day?

01:30:54.083 --> 01:30:56.291
You kept thinking l was pregnant...

01:30:56.292 --> 01:30:58.457
yet still thought of
playing and drinking

01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:02.207
Actually l wanted to earn more money
so you can have your own studio

01:31:02.625 --> 01:31:04.957
The baby's gone and l feel so sorry, too

01:31:04.958 --> 01:31:06.707
I also need someone to comfort me

01:31:06.958 --> 01:31:07.999
Sorry, Summer

01:31:08.875 --> 01:31:10.207
Would you forgive me?

01:31:11.375 --> 01:31:12.291
We can't return

01:31:13.375 --> 01:31:14.666
Unless time can go backwards

01:31:16.792 --> 01:31:19.207
Summer!

01:31:45.958 --> 01:31:46.582
Hello?

01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:53.082
Ok, ok...

01:31:53.375 --> 01:31:54.207
What's that?

01:31:56.167 --> 01:31:56.916
I get it.

01:32:03.625 --> 01:32:04.707
Hi, Vivi

01:32:05.125 --> 01:32:07.082
Do you know anyone from flash gang?

01:32:10.083 --> 01:32:11.499
OK. OK...

01:32:11.500 --> 01:32:12.332
What's up?

01:32:18.292 --> 01:32:19.916
Summer, it's Maxim

01:32:19.958 --> 01:32:22.124
Let's come out and chat tonight.
Don't be so boring

01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:24.457
1 0 o'clock at the crossroad junction

01:32:41.708 --> 01:32:43.374
Five... come forward...

01:32:43.375 --> 01:32:44.416
Get the stamp here

01:32:46.750 --> 01:32:47.582
Hold it...

01:32:49.375 --> 01:32:50.707
How long do I need to wait this time?

01:32:51.250 --> 01:32:52.707
Ok, just once

01:32:53.250 --> 01:32:54.416
I'll give you the stamp

01:32:54.750 --> 01:32:55.582
Really?

01:32:56.750 --> 01:32:57.541
Thank you!

01:32:57.750 --> 01:32:59.166
I can get in finally!

01:33:24.250 --> 01:33:25.416
Maxim?

01:33:26.042 --> 01:33:26.707
Where are you?

01:33:26.708 --> 01:33:29.082
I'm at the crossroad junction.
Where are you?

01:33:29.542 --> 01:33:31.749
I'm almost there...
just wait for a while

01:33:31.833 --> 01:33:33.124
Ok, be quick

01:34:02.833 --> 01:34:04.166
They are playing the rearview mirror

01:34:04.167 --> 01:34:05.041
Let's play, too

01:34:05.042 --> 01:34:06.249
Ok

01:34:06.500 --> 01:34:07.916
- Backwards... - What's up?

01:34:07.958 --> 01:34:09.999
- Backwards... - Let me in!

01:34:10.542 --> 01:34:12.541
It's hard to wait until they let me in.
I'm not playing!

01:34:12.542 --> 01:34:13.749
Why are you going backwards, bitch?

01:34:20.792 --> 01:34:22.666
Hey buddies, time to move

01:34:22.667 --> 01:34:24.916
In order to help Rain,
I'm moving backwards

01:34:25.083 --> 01:34:26.666
Ready... backwards!

01:34:28.625 --> 01:34:31.041
Backwards!

01:34:40.833 --> 01:34:42.957
Backwards, backwards, backwards...

01:34:42.958 --> 01:34:44.582
Watch out, watch out...

01:34:44.583 --> 01:34:47.166
Backwards, backwards...

01:34:47.167 --> 01:34:48.249
Make a turn...

01:34:50.208 --> 01:34:54.291
Backwards, backwards, backwards...

01:35:10.833 --> 01:35:11.999
Would you forgive me?

01:35:12.292 --> 01:35:13.291
We can't return

01:35:14.292 --> 01:35:15.624
Unless time can go backwards

01:35:50.750 --> 01:35:51.957
What l do today

01:35:56.083 --> 01:35:57.457
is helped by that many friends

01:35:58.500 --> 01:36:01.207
I just want to go back to that day

01:36:01.917 --> 01:36:03.541
and retrieve what l've said wrong

01:36:04.917 --> 01:36:06.124
To retrieve what l've done wrong

01:36:08.875 --> 01:36:10.124
I hope you could forgive me

01:36:11.042 --> 01:36:12.124
Will you forgive me?

01:36:28.417 --> 01:36:32.207
Kiss her! Kiss her...

01:36:57.167 --> 01:36:58.749
No matter how the world change

01:36:58.875 --> 01:37:02.041
Lang Kwai Fong is still Lang Kwai Fong

01:37:05.125 --> 01:37:07.457
Chef Hung is still having his happy life

01:37:07.667 --> 01:37:10.624
But only one shepherd dog left

01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:16.832
As to Avis and QQ...

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:18.707
They have happy ending

01:37:27.250 --> 01:37:30.082
Sources said Don had met
Siri once afterwards

01:37:34.042 --> 01:37:36.457
But they acted like strangers

01:37:38.292 --> 01:37:42.791
The Japanese DJ got a police to be her
private bodyguard since then

01:37:47.958 --> 01:37:50.749
As to Summer and Rain...
they still like night life

01:37:51.167 --> 01:37:53.416
Of course after they had fun...

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:56.124
The one beside won't be done
after uncovered

01:37:57.500 --> 01:38:56.124
