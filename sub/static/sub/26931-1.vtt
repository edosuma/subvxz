02:33.920 --> 02:35.679
It's loose.

02:35.680 --> 02:37.842
Chill, I'm not done.

02:39.160 --> 02:41.367
Would I let Boss down?

02:41.720 --> 02:42.679
It's true.

02:42.680 --> 02:44.125
My brother only trusts you.

02:44.126 --> 02:45.087
Right.

02:49.520 --> 02:52.319
He tells me "left", I go left.

02:52.320 --> 02:54.368
He tells me "right", I go right.

02:54.369 --> 02:57.011
Why doesn't he trust me?

02:57.240 --> 02:58.559
Like "lefty-loosey,

02:58.560 --> 03:00.199
righty-tighty".

03:00.200 --> 03:02.559
Your left may not be his left.

03:02.560 --> 03:05.039
Your right may not be his right.

03:05.040 --> 03:06.041
Busy talking?

03:06.760 --> 03:08.125
Let's move, one to each car.

03:08.126 --> 03:08.999
Get going!

03:09.000 --> 03:09.922
HEY

03:10.600 --> 03:12.125
The guy my brother trusts.

03:12.240 --> 03:12.919
Yeah?

03:12.920 --> 03:14.410
He wants you to join him.

03:14.411 --> 03:15.162
Okay.

03:41.120 --> 03:41.719
Go ahead.

03:41.720 --> 03:43.848
They drove off in three taxis

03:44.120 --> 03:45.446
with bombs in each one.

03:45.447 --> 03:46.441
Where did they go?

03:46.442 --> 03:47.399
Unsure.

03:47.400 --> 03:49.687
Two Toyotas, one Nissan.

03:50.080 --> 03:52.639
"DB 2436"

03:55.120 --> 03:58.044
"FA 969"

03:59.040 --> 04:00.804
Why does my brother trust him, not me?

04:01.040 --> 04:03.122
I don't trust him at all.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.285
Peng Hong is very cautious

04:06.286 --> 04:08.159
I don't know his plan yet.

04:08.160 --> 04:09.161
Stay in touch.

04:09.640 --> 04:11.319
He made three car bombs.

04:11.320 --> 04:12.890
All three are taxis.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.004
There are over 20,000 taxis in Hong Kong.

04:15.240 --> 04:16.446
Here are the license plate numbers.

04:50.040 --> 04:52.247
Have a drink, let's celebrate first.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.759
We lost the GPS signal of JS.

05:10.760 --> 05:11.719
Keep tracking.

05:11.720 --> 05:12.881
Have you located the three taxis?

05:12.882 --> 05:13.881
Not yet, sir.

05:23.640 --> 05:24.926
We'll be rich!

05:57.240 --> 05:58.287
Hey! Stop there!

06:21.200 --> 06:22.159
All Units,

06:22.160 --> 06:23.844
Heung To Bank Gold Vault is being attacked.

06:24.800 --> 06:27.201
Sir, Heung To Bank is being attacked.

06:27.202 --> 06:28.247
All units, take action.

06:28.248 --> 06:29.048
Yes, sir.

06:57.560 --> 06:58.971
Bring another cart.

07:21.240 --> 07:22.366
It smells great.

08:17.520 --> 08:19.761
Don't lose them.

08:30.280 --> 08:31.964
Crash into him... Go ahead.

08:46.760 --> 08:47.886
Fun, JS?

08:51.680 --> 08:52.719
Slow down...

08:52.720 --> 08:53.403
- Let them catch up.
- Yes.

08:53.404 --> 08:54.561
Let them catch up.

08:55.120 --> 08:56.007
They're coming.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.839
Brother, did you see that?

09:13.840 --> 09:15.046
I did it.

09:20.600 --> 09:22.090
Calling Control. Officer down.

09:22.091 --> 09:22.763
Hurry.

09:38.920 --> 09:39.959
All units, stop.

09:39.960 --> 09:41.200
Do not enter the car park.

09:41.320 --> 09:42.765
Beware of car bombs.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.371
Go around to block them.

10:13.640 --> 10:14.687
What the heck?

10:29.560 --> 10:30.368
Stop.

10:41.240 --> 10:42.685
Put your gun down.

10:43.200 --> 10:44.565
Put your gun down

10:45.040 --> 10:46.164
I order you to put your gun down.

10:46.165 --> 10:47.002
- Police.
- Put your gun down.

10:47.003 --> 10:48.411
Put down your weapons, freeze

10:48.412 --> 10:50.243
I said, put your gun down.

10:52.880 --> 10:53.449
Get out of the car.

10:54.720 --> 10:55.881
Hands up.

10:56.280 --> 10:57.725
- Turn that way.
- Stop.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.768
Set him free, he is our man.

11:01.360 --> 11:03.362
My elder brother will come and save me.

11:05.560 --> 11:07.199
Traitor.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.009
He will never stop hunting you down.

11:09.840 --> 11:11.251
- He definitely will come to save me.
- Take him away.

11:11.252 --> 11:13.208
He won't let you off the hook.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.531
They entered the pedestrian tunnel

11:20.880 --> 11:22.689
Roger, we'll go block them from the front.

12:04.360 --> 12:05.361
Scumbag.

12:06.240 --> 12:07.366
Scumbag.

12:18.200 --> 12:19.440
Sir, a bomb!

12:51.960 --> 12:52.839
Listen up.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.081
Please put your cell phones in the locker

12:55.082 --> 12:56.570
together with any flash drives

12:56.571 --> 12:57.319
or lighters.

12:57.320 --> 12:57.969
Thank you very much.

12:58.280 --> 12:59.008
Thank you, sir.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.923
Plastic explosives,

13:01.924 --> 13:02.762
as its name implies,

13:02.763 --> 13:05.331
can be formed into different shapes,

13:05.560 --> 13:08.131
making them difficult to be detected.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.089
Even x-ray machines cannot detect them.

13:10.240 --> 13:11.287
One kind of plastic explosives is.

13:11.288 --> 13:13.599
Composition C-4.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.639
Its power of damage is greater than TNT.

13:16.640 --> 13:17.448
Its explosive velocity

13:17.449 --> 13:19.522
can be up to 8km per second.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.086
This is a dummy of the American-made model.

13:22.087 --> 13:24.799
MKII fragmentation-type hand grenade.

13:24.800 --> 13:25.684
It weighs 600 grams

13:25.685 --> 13:27.565
and is filled with 6O grams of TNT.

13:27.566 --> 13:29.164
It has a safety pin inside.

13:29.440 --> 13:31.522
If I pull it out and let go.

13:32.120 --> 13:33.879
The striker spring

13:33.880 --> 13:35.405
will bump against the detonator inside

13:35.406 --> 13:36.999
ignition will occur,

13:37.000 --> 13:40.125
the grenade will explode
in a delay of 3.2 to 4 seconds

13:40.126 --> 13:41.770
with a lethal range of 3 meters.

13:42.280 --> 13:42.999
Yes.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.284
If the hand grenade is held in hand

13:44.285 --> 13:45.361
with the safety pin removed

13:45.362 --> 13:47.283
then the grenade will not explode, correct?

13:47.284 --> 13:48.247
Correct.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.165
But I am curious.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.126
Why wouldn't you let it go?

13:53.127 --> 13:54.565
It's not a girl's hand.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.922
But in case you're so unfortunate

13:57.923 --> 14:01.049
to be holding a hand grenade
without a safety pin.

14:01.360 --> 14:02.247
Remember

14:06.680 --> 14:08.762
you must hold on to it like a girl's hand.

14:08.763 --> 14:10.319
Don't let go so easily.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.367
Thank you.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.410
We, the Explosive Ordinance Disposal unit,

14:14.411 --> 14:16.801
work in teams of two during operations.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.206
This is Superintendent JS Cheung.

14:18.207 --> 14:19.770
He is Bomb Disposal Number One.

14:19.771 --> 14:20.919
As Number Two,

14:20.920 --> 14:23.204
my job is to assist Number One to complete

14:23.205 --> 14:25.122
the mission as safely
and quickly as possible.

14:25.123 --> 14:27.599
If a hand grenade lands in front of me

14:27.600 --> 14:29.648
but it doesn't explode after 4 seconds

14:29.720 --> 14:30.721
what shall I do?

14:30.722 --> 14:31.881
You should thank God

14:31.882 --> 14:33.530
and run away.

14:33.680 --> 14:34.522
No, it should be

14:34.523 --> 14:37.046
run first, and then thank God.

14:49.520 --> 14:50.519
Officer Cheung.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.363
Today is your lucky day.

14:53.200 --> 14:54.919
Every day is my lucky day

14:54.920 --> 14:56.922
I like more academic girls.

14:58.120 --> 14:58.962
Hello.

14:59.240 --> 15:01.039
My handbag was just here.

15:01.040 --> 15:01.764
Give it back to me.

15:01.765 --> 15:03.602
Sweetie, we didn't take your handbag.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.043
My ID card, money, everything is inside.

15:06.044 --> 15:07.279
It's very important

15:07.280 --> 15:09.681
I understand, but I really didn't take it.

15:10.000 --> 15:11.684
Then where is my handbag?

15:12.800 --> 15:14.131
Go look somewhere else.

15:17.960 --> 15:19.041
Stop.

15:19.520 --> 15:23.119
Boys and girls, attention please.

15:23.120 --> 15:26.279
If anyone finds a yellow handbag...

15:26.280 --> 15:28.851
Officer Cheung, maybe you
should take her away.

15:29.560 --> 15:31.045
You can't drink until you're 18.

15:31.046 --> 15:32.087
Show me your ID card.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.400
Are you going there?

16:02.960 --> 16:04.039
Who is she?

16:04.040 --> 16:05.963
Officer Cheung from EOD brought her here.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.839
Is he from Anti-vice?

16:07.840 --> 16:09.602
Why would he bring a drunken whore here?

16:09.603 --> 16:10.647
How would I know?

16:12.120 --> 16:14.009
Officer Cheung, she's coming to.

16:14.440 --> 16:15.399
Please be kind.

16:15.400 --> 16:16.890
Don't call her a drunken whore.

16:17.720 --> 16:18.759
Sorry, sir.

16:18.760 --> 16:19.921
You were so excited

16:20.240 --> 16:21.844
you forgot I am in the chat group too.

16:21.920 --> 16:23.039
She is drunk

16:23.040 --> 16:24.565
but not a whore.

16:43.440 --> 16:44.805
Diameter: 14 (inches)

16:45.520 --> 16:46.931
Length: 44 (inches)

16:47.240 --> 16:49.527
It's a war-time aerial
bomb filled with TNT.

16:49.528 --> 16:51.249
Model number M64.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.759
With a nose fuse.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.171
Standard weight is 500 pounds.

16:54.172 --> 16:56.319
This device can destroy a tank.

16:56.320 --> 16:57.287
That's true.

16:57.880 --> 16:59.120
And it's very unstable.

16:59.360 --> 17:01.647
Immediately evacuate nearby residents.

17:02.080 --> 17:04.320
Expand lockdown area to 100 meters.

17:04.321 --> 17:05.287
Yes, sir.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.002
Everyone, please stand back a bit.

17:10.002 --> 17:11.650
Don't obstruct police from working.

17:12.520 --> 17:14.170
Officer Cheung, your tools.

17:14.240 --> 17:15.127
Thank you.

17:15.760 --> 17:16.439
Officer Cheung.

17:16.440 --> 17:17.406
Will you put on the EOD suit?

17:17.407 --> 17:19.880
You said it could destroy a tank

17:19.960 --> 17:21.405
so, why bother?

18:03.120 --> 18:05.566
Ben, I will drill the nose fuse now

18:05.840 --> 18:06.568
Roger

19:02.280 --> 19:03.319
Ben

19:03.320 --> 19:05.923
I've injected Type 3
fuse coagulant into it.

19:05.924 --> 19:07.570
The fuse should be stabilized

19:07.920 --> 19:09.445
lam starting to remove the fuse

19:09.800 --> 19:10.722
Roger.

20:06.960 --> 20:09.361
Don't be chicken, it is stable

20:11.320 --> 20:12.651
I'm not going back to HQ.

20:12.652 --> 20:13.839
Tell the boss.

20:13.840 --> 20:16.319
After my vacation, I'll
go see him with my report.

20:16.320 --> 20:16.959
Yes, sir.

20:16.960 --> 20:17.643
Thank you

20:18.080 --> 20:18.922
I must go.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.082
Bye, Officer Cheung.

20:21.320 --> 20:22.526
Bye.

20:24.200 --> 20:26.122
Boys and girls, please behave.

20:26.123 --> 20:27.360
- Come here.
- Miss Li.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.679
Don't play on the road.

20:29.680 --> 20:31.039
It's very dangerous.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.599
Good girl.

20:32.600 --> 20:33.249
Come.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.090
Let me give you a "like".

20:40.120 --> 20:41.042
Thank you.

20:41.280 --> 20:42.850
Daddy.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.199
Bye.

20:45.200 --> 20:46.770
Where we go playing?

20:48.120 --> 20:49.879
Are you a parent?

20:49.880 --> 20:51.245
Hello, Miss Li.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.962
Bye.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.401
Do you come to file a complaint against me?

20:55.402 --> 20:56.367
Miss Li.

20:56.560 --> 20:57.891
Bye.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.645
How come you know I teach here?

20:59.646 --> 21:01.688
I forgot to tell you I'm a cop.

21:04.040 --> 21:04.719
Officer.

21:04.720 --> 21:05.528
Miss.

21:06.200 --> 21:07.770
My name is JS Cheung.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.561
Officer Cheung.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.204
If those parents found out

21:14.040 --> 21:15.962
I got stinking drunk in a bar

21:15.963 --> 21:18.084
and was brought to a police station

21:18.085 --> 21:19.525
I don't know what they'll do

21:19.526 --> 21:21.359
I'm normally not like that.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.563
You don't have to tell me

21:22.564 --> 21:23.846
I really don't mind

21:26.040 --> 21:27.644
I've been separated for six months

21:28.120 --> 21:30.202
and just signed the divorce papers

21:31.920 --> 21:35.239
I went to the bar just to drown my sorrows.

21:35.240 --> 21:36.999
Then I wanted to see

21:37.000 --> 21:40.129
if I still "got it".

21:45.560 --> 21:47.289
You can just let me off up ahead.

21:47.290 --> 21:47.959
It's okay.

21:47.960 --> 21:48.881
Where are you going?

21:48.882 --> 21:50.450
I have time to give you a ride.

21:50.840 --> 21:51.727
No, thanks

21:52.040 --> 21:52.927
I don't want to...

21:53.560 --> 21:54.607
But I do.

21:55.840 --> 21:56.966
<i>No</i>

21:57.160 --> 22:00.004
I don't want to get
involved with a taken man

22:00.005 --> 22:01.206
I'm not.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.691
You don't believe me?

22:41.120 --> 22:42.759
In tonight's mission,

22:42.760 --> 22:45.559
an undercover officer helped us

22:45.560 --> 22:47.688
raid an armed robbery organization.

22:47.689 --> 22:49.648
We arrested two suspects.

22:50.440 --> 22:51.521
We have issued

22:52.240 --> 22:54.239
a bounty of HK$5 million

22:54.240 --> 22:56.561
for the arrest of the other suspects

23:04.360 --> 23:08.251
I will wire $50 million
in to your Cayman account.

23:09.640 --> 23:11.399
After I get the money

23:11.400 --> 23:14.119
in a month's time my team will have

23:14.120 --> 23:15.929
trickled into Hong Kong.

23:19.280 --> 23:22.159
And now, our EOD bomb disposal expert.

23:22.160 --> 23:24.208
Superintendent JS Cheung, please.

23:37.680 --> 23:40.331
Please say a few words, Officer Cheung.

23:47.520 --> 23:49.921
Many people ask why I joined EOD

23:50.760 --> 23:52.728
including my girlfriend

23:52.840 --> 23:54.839
I told her a story.

23:54.840 --> 23:57.844
It's called <Belling the Cat>

23:58.400 --> 24:00.359
Long ago, a group of mice

24:00.360 --> 24:03.405
wanted a way to go out of
their hole to find food

24:03.406 --> 24:05.684
without being eaten by the cat outside.

24:05.685 --> 24:06.727
Finally they had an idea:

24:06.728 --> 24:09.087
Hang a bell on the cat.

24:09.800 --> 24:10.845
Every time they hear the bell

24:10.846 --> 24:12.569
they would stay in the
hole, and all will be well.

24:12.570 --> 24:14.239
But the question was

24:14.240 --> 24:17.679
which mouse should hang the bell?

24:17.680 --> 24:18.966
As they were discussing that,

24:18.967 --> 24:21.645
a little mouse raised his hand

24:22.040 --> 24:23.326
and said, "I'll go".

24:24.200 --> 24:25.839
Everyone was curious:

24:25.840 --> 24:27.205
"Why you?"

24:27.800 --> 24:29.006
The little mouse said

24:29.007 --> 24:30.359
in its heart.

24:30.360 --> 24:32.761
Righteousness takes priority over life.

24:33.280 --> 24:36.090
Therefore I chose to be this mouse.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.604
Bomb disposal is not something

24:40.960 --> 24:42.644
you can just do.

24:43.120 --> 24:44.770
It is divine providence

24:47.800 --> 24:49.450
lam very grateful to God

24:51.240 --> 24:54.722
for letting me make
the right choices in every mission

24:56.040 --> 24:57.929
lam very grateful to God

24:58.960 --> 25:00.642
for allowing me to use my life

25:00.643 --> 25:02.130
to protect others' lives.

25:14.440 --> 25:15.521
Hey, girlfriend.

25:15.720 --> 25:17.927
Do I look good dressing up in uniform?

25:17.928 --> 25:19.126
It's okay.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.804
You still look like a bomb disposal expert.

25:20.805 --> 25:21.687
Officer Cheung.

25:22.680 --> 25:23.601
They don't serve coffee.

25:23.602 --> 25:24.647
Drink this instead.

25:25.280 --> 25:25.929
Thank you.

25:26.200 --> 25:26.883
Thank you.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.085
- Congratulations, Officer Chung.
- JS.

25:29.086 --> 25:29.967
Congratulations.

25:29.968 --> 25:32.399
Today you've finally waited long...

25:32.400 --> 25:33.970
What was that?

25:34.920 --> 25:36.206
I was talking gibberish.

25:36.207 --> 25:37.199
Stop that crap.

25:37.200 --> 25:39.441
Let's drink to a pretty woman first.

25:39.442 --> 25:41.647
Officer Cheung seldom brings girlfriend.

25:41.840 --> 25:42.762
What is your name?

25:42.960 --> 25:43.563
Carmen.

25:44.880 --> 25:45.881
It's Miss Li.

25:46.040 --> 25:47.079
She's a teacher.

25:47.080 --> 25:47.959
A teacher!

25:47.960 --> 25:48.679
Yes.

25:48.680 --> 25:50.011
A match made in heaven.

25:50.012 --> 25:51.161
Of course.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.248
In any case, congratulations.

25:53.320 --> 25:54.160
- Congratulations.
- Cheers.

25:54.161 --> 25:55.366
- Congrats to Officer Cheung.
- Cheers.

25:56.560 --> 25:57.925
How long have you known each other?

25:57.926 --> 25:58.999
About a year.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.044
You've been tight-lipped

26:00.045 --> 26:01.690
I was afraid you'd steal her

26:03.880 --> 26:05.086
I'll drop by in a few days.

26:05.087 --> 26:05.719
Great

26:05.720 --> 26:07.525
I'll cook some special dishes for you.

26:07.526 --> 26:08.169
Bye, Carmen.

26:08.170 --> 26:09.082
Bye-bye.

26:09.960 --> 26:10.847
Let's go.

26:28.640 --> 26:29.562
Oh my God!

26:30.280 --> 26:31.088
It's Officer Chow's car.

26:31.089 --> 26:32.969
Fire!

27:15.960 --> 27:17.086
Here is the report.

27:18.920 --> 27:20.081
It is C-4 explosive.

27:20.082 --> 27:21.286
The initial estimate is that

27:21.440 --> 27:24.919
the bomb was attached by magnet to the car.

27:24.920 --> 27:26.405
But it was not a time bomb

27:26.406 --> 27:28.209
nor triggered by starting the engine

27:28.360 --> 27:31.039
but by short-distance remote control.

27:31.040 --> 27:32.963
The killer was at the site.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.645
At least not far away.

27:36.160 --> 27:39.045
He wanted to watch Officer
Chow's car explode.

27:39.046 --> 27:40.403
We think the motive was revenge.

27:40.404 --> 27:42.289
When I was undercover back then.

27:42.680 --> 27:44.728
Officer Chow was my handler.

27:47.040 --> 27:50.249
At first, he wanted me
for the UC assignment

27:51.400 --> 27:54.119
but Hong was famous for explosives

27:54.120 --> 27:55.999
so he found you in EOD.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.570
Peng Hong.

27:58.080 --> 27:59.286
Well

27:59.720 --> 28:01.039
I'll get him caught.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.724
If it's really Peng Hong.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.525
He'll will come for you anyway.

28:04.526 --> 28:06.329
You took my place back then

28:06.330 --> 28:08.399
I must ensure your safety now

28:08.400 --> 28:10.289
I'll assign 24-hour protection for you

28:11.880 --> 28:13.609
I can take care of myself.

28:16.840 --> 28:17.727
Yes.

28:19.120 --> 28:19.962
All right

28:20.920 --> 28:21.967
I'm on my way.

28:23.120 --> 28:23.882
Hello?

28:25.640 --> 28:29.247
(Beware of Bomb)

28:30.040 --> 28:30.879
lam so sorry...

28:30.880 --> 28:31.767
It's very dangerous here.

28:31.768 --> 28:33.283
Please leave the premises now.

28:33.284 --> 28:35.328
Excuse us, please leave the premises now.

28:35.520 --> 28:38.364
Attention, all units.
Evacuate everyone now...

28:38.560 --> 28:40.449
No one is allowed to enter the blockade.

28:41.040 --> 28:43.008
Attention all units...

28:43.200 --> 28:45.159
Evacuate...

28:45.160 --> 28:46.889
Run! Get out!

28:47.720 --> 28:49.279
Evacuate, go.

28:49.280 --> 28:50.925
Keep moving, everyone leave.

28:50.926 --> 28:52.649
Allow the fire trucks in...

29:25.280 --> 29:27.799
Mercury detonator, how creative.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.086
Use the electronic x-ray machine.

29:29.087 --> 29:30.002
Yes, sir.

29:30.880 --> 29:32.245
This is the primer.

29:34.320 --> 29:37.244
This square should be C-4.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.925
Not suitable for on-site neutralization.

29:38.926 --> 29:41.044
It is a timed Improvised Explosive Device

29:41.045 --> 29:42.201
of very high lethality.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.570
When will it explode?

29:46.320 --> 29:47.839
The timer is blocked

29:47.840 --> 29:48.887
I cannot see it well.

29:49.520 --> 29:50.681
Any plan?

29:52.440 --> 29:54.283
Go closer to get a better look.

30:06.880 --> 30:09.244
Officer Kong, I am now
going to examine the IED

30:09.245 --> 30:11.607
I'm handing on-site command
to Number Two, Ben.

30:18.720 --> 30:19.607
Power on.

30:22.200 --> 30:23.361
Here are the tools.

31:10.960 --> 31:11.879
Gum?

31:11.880 --> 31:13.086
How filthy.

31:19.320 --> 31:21.163
Hurry.

31:21.560 --> 31:23.085
It will blow up soon.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.250
One-thousand-one.

31:48.600 --> 31:50.090
One-thousand-two.

31:50.320 --> 31:51.810
One-thousand-three

31:52.600 --> 31:53.399
Ben,

31:53.400 --> 31:55.926
I estimate the IED will
explode in 10 minutes.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.922
It may be dangerous to move it

31:57.923 --> 31:59.331
I'll take care of it now

32:02.840 --> 32:04.804
I will coagulate the mercury
with low temperature

32:04.805 --> 32:06.039
to stop the explosion.

32:06.040 --> 32:07.644
Prepare the liquid nitrogen.

32:07.760 --> 32:08.439
Yes, sir.

32:08.440 --> 32:09.202
Liquid nitrogen, now.

32:09.203 --> 32:10.042
Now.

32:11.400 --> 32:12.321
Attention all units

32:12.322 --> 32:14.163
100% evacuation is mandatory.

32:19.120 --> 32:20.882
There's someone up there. EOD suspend.

32:20.883 --> 32:22.083
Officer Cheung, suspend action.

32:22.084 --> 32:23.286
Trespassers on site

32:28.160 --> 32:29.161
I'll wait.

32:30.360 --> 32:31.805
Hurry up.

32:32.040 --> 32:33.121
It will blow soon.

32:36.040 --> 32:37.644
We're hereto shoot the bomb.

32:43.280 --> 32:43.962
Out of the way.

32:43.963 --> 32:44.609
Get out of here.

32:44.610 --> 32:45.965
EOD, confirm

32:46.360 --> 32:47.282
evacuation is complete.

32:48.880 --> 32:50.530
Officer Cheung, evacuation complete.

33:24.360 --> 33:25.850
Good job.

33:26.560 --> 33:30.087
But it's not over yet.

33:33.080 --> 33:33.599
Clear

33:33.600 --> 33:34.408
Roger.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.685
Officer Kong, the device has been disarmed.

33:37.686 --> 33:40.283
Do not remove the blockade
until further notice

33:40.284 --> 33:42.408
CSI colleagues, you may
begin to gather evidence.

33:51.640 --> 33:52.721
If you put a time bomb here

33:52.722 --> 33:54.046
what time would you set it at?

33:54.047 --> 33:55.041
Of course at lunchtime.

33:55.042 --> 33:55.879
Why?

33:55.880 --> 33:57.211
There are most people here at lunchtime.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.401
The bastard who put it there

33:58.402 --> 34:00.129
would want to create the most casualty.

34:01.880 --> 34:03.564
But it isn't crowded at the time

34:03.565 --> 34:05.210
the bomb was set.

34:05.640 --> 34:06.562
Thank you.

34:15.920 --> 34:16.964
Who called the police?

34:16.965 --> 34:18.246
A man called the police.

34:18.800 --> 34:19.684
All he said was.

34:19.685 --> 34:21.842
"There's a bomb in the
Gloucester Road Garden."

34:23.400 --> 34:25.208
He may have set the bomb.

34:26.760 --> 34:27.841
Calling Officer Kong.

34:28.400 --> 34:30.289
Hazardous object at the
courthouse front door.

34:33.320 --> 34:34.161
Allow me.

34:39.239 --> 34:41.163
C-4, at least three pounds of it.

34:41.639 --> 34:42.971
The circuitry is very complicated.

34:43.040 --> 34:44.246
If it explodes

34:44.880 --> 34:47.565
all the glass in the nearby
buildings will shatter.

34:48.719 --> 34:49.926
How much longer until it explodes?

34:51.760 --> 34:52.518
Three minutes.

34:52.520 --> 34:53.203
There's still time.

34:53.560 --> 34:54.607
- Let's go.
- Officer Kong.

34:54.608 --> 34:57.199
Bomb, make way.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.039
Make way, now!

34:59.040 --> 35:00.405
Give it to me.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.286
Let's go.

35:21.680 --> 35:24.126
It's my first time drifting
with a bomb in my arms.

35:27.600 --> 35:29.011
Will it blow when it's shaken hard?

35:29.012 --> 35:29.799
<i>No.</i>

35:29.800 --> 35:30.599
C-4 is very stable.

35:30.600 --> 35:31.806
It won't blow even when shot at

35:32.600 --> 35:33.726
I've drive faster, then.

35:33.727 --> 35:34.642
Sit tight.

35:44.920 --> 35:45.603
Go!

35:47.000 --> 35:48.331
Make way.

35:48.600 --> 35:49.647
Get out of the way.

35:50.800 --> 35:51.767
Wait.

35:51.960 --> 35:53.121
- Wait.
- What's up?

35:53.122 --> 35:54.406
- Wait.
- There's no time.

35:54.407 --> 35:55.970
- Wait...
- Let's go.

35:57.840 --> 35:58.639
Wait.

35:58.640 --> 35:59.721
Wait a moment.

36:00.560 --> 36:01.368
Ready?

36:01.440 --> 36:02.601
Hurry!

36:02.800 --> 36:03.562
Okay?

36:04.280 --> 36:04.963
Yes.

36:08.600 --> 36:09.283
Run!

36:23.440 --> 36:25.204
You wanted a picture to post on Facebook?

36:27.560 --> 36:28.879
As a souvenir.

36:28.880 --> 36:30.166
Are you nuts?

36:32.240 --> 36:34.679
Two bomb threats in a row.

36:34.680 --> 36:36.006
He is provoking the Police.

36:36.007 --> 36:37.725
We've found out the call to the police

36:37.726 --> 36:40.041
was made from a phone booth at the Garden.

36:40.042 --> 36:41.845
Both bombs and the murder of Officer Chow

36:41.846 --> 36:43.246
look to be the work of one person

36:43.247 --> 36:45.524
I suspect it is the fugitive Peng Hong

36:45.525 --> 36:46.803
I worked with him for two years.

36:46.804 --> 36:47.961
Knowing his personality.

36:47.962 --> 36:50.361
For sure, there should be more to come.

36:50.362 --> 36:52.886
About the bomb discovery case yesterday

36:53.320 --> 36:55.163
I have made it first priority for my men

36:55.280 --> 36:56.805
to crack the case as soon as possible.

36:57.880 --> 37:00.039
The Police never allow anyone

37:00.040 --> 37:01.804
to undermine the security of Hong Kong.

37:27.640 --> 37:28.721
You didn't sleep?

37:31.320 --> 37:32.810
I dozed off for a while.

37:38.000 --> 37:39.206
Sleep some more

37:39.920 --> 37:41.410
I go make you breakfast

37:41.411 --> 37:43.368
wake you up when it's ready.

38:14.880 --> 38:16.086
You're up?

38:18.800 --> 38:21.929
I am making you breakfast in bed.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.401
Let me help.

38:42.680 --> 38:43.602
You'll cook??

38:46.280 --> 38:47.725
Egg (bomb) disposal expert

38:55.600 --> 38:58.046
I've watched a lot of superhero movies.

38:58.400 --> 38:59.925
Girlfriends of superheroes

38:59.926 --> 39:01.888
never end up well.

39:01.960 --> 39:03.166
That's right.

39:03.360 --> 39:04.646
It's a hard life.

39:05.760 --> 39:06.921
Sorry.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.529
You know I've just divorced

39:10.120 --> 39:11.281
I don't want to walk out from one nightmare

39:11.282 --> 39:13.044
into another one

39:19.120 --> 39:20.884
I've thought about that for you.

39:20.885 --> 39:22.006
Why don't we...

39:23.240 --> 39:24.605
just let it go?

39:25.840 --> 39:26.762
Great.

39:27.320 --> 39:29.721
We can still be friends.

39:32.080 --> 39:34.560
Like this? Or ordinary friends?

39:35.720 --> 39:36.960
Ordinary friends.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.288
Okay, I'll leave after breakfast.

39:45.120 --> 39:47.043
Do you still want breakfast in bed?

40:09.040 --> 40:10.007
Come...

40:10.280 --> 40:11.441
Don't miss the laser beams.

40:11.442 --> 40:13.359
Ready 1, 2, 3.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.169
Lily, are you having a good time?

40:15.170 --> 40:16.519
Very much so.

40:16.520 --> 40:17.719
Told you.

40:17.720 --> 40:18.846
We're not those shopping tours, and

40:18.847 --> 40:20.330
have lots of time for taking photos.

40:20.331 --> 40:21.321
Thank you.

40:21.440 --> 40:22.566
That's my job to make you happy.

40:23.200 --> 40:24.281
Mr. Chan, did you take your medicine?

40:24.800 --> 40:25.720
I was having such a good time

40:25.721 --> 40:26.685
I forgot to take my medicine.

40:26.686 --> 40:28.125
Get in the bus. I'll get you some water.

40:28.440 --> 40:29.439
You're so nice.

40:29.440 --> 40:30.009
You're most welcome.

40:30.010 --> 40:32.446
We'll cross the harbor
and go back to the hotel now.

40:32.447 --> 40:33.079
Okay...

40:33.080 --> 40:34.445
Let's go, Chuen.

40:35.280 --> 40:36.441
Sit tight...

40:48.000 --> 40:48.799
Mr. Chiu.

40:48.800 --> 40:49.528
Yes.

40:49.640 --> 40:51.210
Let's go to my friend's
bar on Hong Kong side

40:51.280 --> 40:53.399
and watch the game there.

40:53.400 --> 40:55.050
My son will treat this evening.

40:55.120 --> 40:56.559
Great.

40:56.560 --> 40:58.439
We're all retirees.

40:58.440 --> 41:00.839
You have a job, so you pay.

41:00.840 --> 41:01.639
Thank you.

41:01.640 --> 41:02.641
You're welcome

41:05.120 --> 41:05.882
Uncle Chiu.

41:09.400 --> 41:10.242
What do you think?

41:10.760 --> 41:12.364
I wish I had a son like you.

41:12.365 --> 41:13.282
Let me see.

41:13.840 --> 41:15.365
You heard that?

41:16.040 --> 41:16.689
What are you doing?

41:16.690 --> 41:17.559
No need to ask.

41:17.560 --> 41:18.891
It must be my birthday gift, right?

41:18.892 --> 41:19.639
<i>No.</i>

41:19.640 --> 41:20.801
- Thank you, son.
- It's not.

41:42.600 --> 41:43.522
Mr. Au.

41:43.880 --> 41:45.166
An accident just happened
inside the Tunnel.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.651
We will now close the Kowloon-bound tube.

42:04.200 --> 42:06.199
My boss just told me.

42:06.200 --> 42:08.009
There's been a problem inside this Tunnel.

42:08.010 --> 42:11.839
So they will use the
one-tube-two-way operation.

42:11.840 --> 42:12.919
You can imagine.

42:12.920 --> 42:14.719
You have two nostrils, one is stuffed up.

42:14.720 --> 42:16.210
Of course it won't go as freely as usual.

42:16.211 --> 42:18.282
Sorry that we have to spend some time here.

42:20.920 --> 42:22.206
Traffic jam again?

42:22.720 --> 42:25.246
It's early, we have plenty of time.

42:26.360 --> 42:29.565
There are three cross-harbor
tunnels in Hong Kong.

42:29.566 --> 42:31.399
This Cross-Harbour Tunnel, the Eastern

42:31.400 --> 42:32.606
and the Western Harbour Crossings.

42:32.607 --> 42:34.439
It's cheapest to take Cross-Harbour Tunnel.

42:34.440 --> 42:35.771
The Eastern Harbour
Crossing is more expensive.

42:35.772 --> 42:38.001
But the most expensive is
the Western Harbour Crossing.

42:38.002 --> 42:38.967
It is so expensive

42:38.968 --> 42:41.167
we call it the Tycoons' Tunnel.

42:43.440 --> 42:45.085
Finally we're inside the Tunnel.

42:45.086 --> 42:45.921
We'll be there soon.

42:45.922 --> 42:47.251
Everybody enjoys the trip

42:59.800 --> 43:01.006
I'm in place.

43:01.080 --> 43:01.922
COPY

43:04.920 --> 43:05.807
Block the Tunnel.

43:05.808 --> 43:06.642
COPY

43:24.120 --> 43:25.406
Who taught you how to drive?

43:25.680 --> 43:26.519
Sit still.

43:26.520 --> 43:27.931
Get back in your car.

43:33.640 --> 43:34.641
Nothing serious.

43:38.000 --> 43:38.762
Go.

43:39.600 --> 43:40.328
Go.

43:40.440 --> 43:41.407
Get out of the car.

43:41.600 --> 43:42.328
Go.

43:46.520 --> 43:47.806
- What's going on?
- Let's go.

43:50.120 --> 43:52.043
Stay in your car.

43:53.440 --> 43:54.919
Back in your car, now.

43:54.920 --> 43:56.046
Don't move.

43:58.560 --> 43:59.641
The Tunnel has been blocked.

43:59.642 --> 44:00.926
They all have guns.

44:05.880 --> 44:06.688
Hey.

44:06.920 --> 44:07.762
What are you doing?

44:08.600 --> 44:09.681
I said, get back in the bus!

44:09.682 --> 44:11.045
- Where are you going?
- Sorry...

44:12.920 --> 44:13.719
Sorry.

44:13.720 --> 44:14.685
He don't (doesn't) speak English.

44:14.686 --> 44:15.522
He don't talk (doesn't speak) English.

44:15.523 --> 44:16.885
Get him back in the bus now.

44:16.886 --> 44:18.159
Okay...

44:18.160 --> 44:19.199
Back to the bus.

44:19.200 --> 44:20.281
What's going on?

44:20.282 --> 44:21.327
Get in the bus.

44:23.440 --> 44:24.441
Get in the bus.

44:24.600 --> 44:26.204
Get back in the car.

44:28.760 --> 44:29.727
What's going on?

44:30.360 --> 44:31.239
What's up?

44:31.240 --> 44:32.571
Don't you move.

44:32.960 --> 44:34.199
Don't think about it.

44:34.200 --> 44:35.565
Get back in your cars.

44:35.566 --> 44:37.642
Be quiet...

44:46.880 --> 44:48.166
I said, get back in the car.

44:48.167 --> 44:49.605
Stay in that car.

44:51.000 --> 44:52.650
Put your hands on the wheel.

45:04.880 --> 45:06.839
This is retired police officer 58698

45:06.840 --> 45:08.126
lam trapped in the Cross-Harbour Tunnel.

45:08.127 --> 45:10.159
There are dozens of armed men.

45:10.160 --> 45:11.844
- Their motive is still unclear.
- They're coming.

45:14.720 --> 45:15.607
Phone.

45:19.360 --> 45:20.361
And yours?

45:21.120 --> 45:21.848
Phone.

45:22.840 --> 45:23.682
Hurry.

45:24.360 --> 45:25.646
Come on... Mobile.

45:26.880 --> 45:28.041
Listen carefully.

45:28.520 --> 45:29.806
My name is Blast

45:30.200 --> 45:32.771
I have hundreds of hostages here

45:34.200 --> 45:35.725
and lots of explosives.

45:36.000 --> 45:37.684
Look at me...

45:38.080 --> 45:38.919
Look here.

45:38.920 --> 45:39.921
Your turn, look at me.

45:40.800 --> 45:41.528
How are you?

45:43.000 --> 45:43.921
Come on, say "Cheese".

45:43.922 --> 45:45.922
Look at the camera, look at me.

45:57.960 --> 46:00.008
They are putting something
on the emergency doors.

46:11.360 --> 46:13.799
Emergency call service
has received dozens of calls.

46:13.800 --> 46:15.190
The telecommunications company has verified

46:15.280 --> 46:16.819
that all are come from
the Cross-Harbour Tunnel.

46:16.820 --> 46:17.851
A retired police officer

46:17.852 --> 46:18.919
also called

46:18.920 --> 46:20.445
we believe that he has become a hostage.

46:20.680 --> 46:22.804
The man in charge called himself "Blast".

46:22.805 --> 46:25.403
We are not sure yet
if he is the suspect of Officer Chow case

46:25.404 --> 46:27.205
or the Wanchai explosion case

46:27.206 --> 46:29.806
I suspect the container truck accident in

46:30.280 --> 46:31.519
another side of the
Tunnel is part of the pot.

46:31.520 --> 46:32.851
The driver is Au Kam Keung.

46:32.960 --> 46:34.359
His record is clean.

46:34.360 --> 46:35.599
He is a delivery guy.

46:35.600 --> 46:37.921
But the order was made under a false name.

46:45.280 --> 46:45.919
Sir.

46:45.920 --> 46:46.967
Sir, this way please

46:47.800 --> 46:49.801
I am CIP Regional Crime Unit YW Kong.

46:49.802 --> 46:51.722
This is Senior Assistant
Chief of Police HF Wan.

46:51.723 --> 46:53.519
We request this office
as our Command Center

46:53.520 --> 46:54.851
and want to meet with your engineers.

47:05.560 --> 47:06.800
Wait here for my command.

47:07.840 --> 47:08.682
Yes, Officer Cheung.

47:28.320 --> 47:29.651
Nothing much is happening for now.

47:29.652 --> 47:30.919
- Lam.
- Yes

47:30.920 --> 47:32.649
send the draft to the papers, be quick.

47:33.520 --> 47:36.086
We have some terrifying and terrible news.

47:36.087 --> 47:38.241
There has been reported
terrorists attack here

47:38.242 --> 47:39.969
behind me in the Kowloon Tunnel...

47:44.320 --> 47:45.401
Sorry, sir.

47:46.160 --> 47:47.359
Camera Two.

47:47.360 --> 47:48.691
Zoom in for a closer look.

47:55.920 --> 47:57.809
That's him, Peng Hong.

48:05.440 --> 48:06.965
That could be plastic explosives.

48:07.560 --> 48:08.966
He's showing it to us on purpose

48:08.967 --> 48:11.004
before he destroyed the
surveillance cameras.

48:11.005 --> 48:12.326
The Cross-Harbour Tunnel

48:12.327 --> 48:14.368
was built using the caisson method

48:14.369 --> 48:17.919
and made up of 15 double-tube segments.

48:17.920 --> 48:19.959
Its total length is 1.86km.

48:19.960 --> 48:21.959
Between the two vehicle tubes

48:21.960 --> 48:24.599
is an engineering tube for maintenance.

48:24.600 --> 48:27.203
Along the Tunnel there
are 15 emergency doors

48:27.204 --> 48:29.122
that connect the two vehicle tubes

48:29.123 --> 48:30.929
ls there a drainage system or

48:31.160 --> 48:32.571
air vent that we can use for an attack?

48:32.720 --> 48:34.529
There are hundreds of hostages inside.

48:34.530 --> 48:35.679
Their safety

48:35.680 --> 48:36.886
is our first priority.

48:38.000 --> 48:38.599
Officer Kong

48:38.600 --> 48:40.125
someone just ran out from
the tube on the right.

48:43.000 --> 48:44.079
Who are they?

48:44.080 --> 48:45.283
Our colleagues in Maintenance.

48:45.284 --> 48:47.328
They must have been hiding
in the engineering tube.

49:05.080 --> 49:07.321
Go... Let's go...

49:08.080 --> 49:09.319
Move out! Let's go!

49:09.320 --> 49:11.399
Get back in the car...

49:11.400 --> 49:12.242
Watch out.

49:17.280 --> 49:18.361
Go...

49:18.560 --> 49:19.721
Clear out.

49:39.880 --> 49:41.450
All units, cover Officer Kong.

50:16.360 --> 50:17.646
Officer Kong, get in the car.

50:22.920 --> 50:24.046
Drive, hurry.

50:32.080 --> 50:33.650
Hold fire, back off.

50:40.280 --> 50:42.123
This is Police Commander HF Wan

50:42.440 --> 50:43.930
I want to talk to Blast

50:43.931 --> 50:45.559
I am Blast.

50:45.560 --> 50:46.846
We need to talk.

50:48.080 --> 50:50.241
You're in no position to negotiate with me

50:50.242 --> 50:52.004
I have hundreds of hostages here.

50:52.120 --> 50:53.201
What do you want'?

50:53.202 --> 50:55.646
You have a bomb disposal expert, right?

50:55.647 --> 50:58.439
His badge number is 63489

50:58.440 --> 51:00.010
I will only talk to him.

51:01.080 --> 51:03.199
About 15 minutes ago

51:03.200 --> 51:04.999
at the Cross-Harbour Tunnel toll plaza

51:05.000 --> 51:06.161
there was an intense gunfight and

51:06.162 --> 51:08.603
an explosion suspected to
be caused by terrorists.

51:08.604 --> 51:10.728
As of now, we don't have
any figure on casualties

51:10.840 --> 51:13.446
but I just saw several bloodied policemen.

51:14.600 --> 51:16.759
(Be careful)

51:16.760 --> 51:19.411
Police do not deny
it may be the work of terrorists.

51:20.400 --> 51:22.084
We don't know exactly
what they are aiming for.

51:22.200 --> 51:25.170
There are numerous armed
policemen ready for combat.

51:36.600 --> 51:39.331
(I believe you can)

52:17.320 --> 52:18.731
Don't move.

52:38.760 --> 52:39.841
All these years

52:40.880 --> 52:42.609
I've thought of you every single day.

52:42.610 --> 52:43.567
And you?

52:44.280 --> 52:46.044
Did you think of me every day?

52:47.040 --> 52:49.441
Surprisingly, we meet here.

52:52.320 --> 52:54.084
Why did you change your name to Blast?

52:55.960 --> 52:57.319
People like us

52:57.320 --> 52:59.082
always rush about or around

52:59.083 --> 53:01.128
must change their names sometimes

53:01.520 --> 53:04.649
I've forgotten my original name

53:05.880 --> 53:07.006
Robin Hood.

53:07.280 --> 53:08.559
That's a good name.

53:08.560 --> 53:09.721
Easy to remember.

53:09.960 --> 53:10.768
Let's go.

53:17.320 --> 53:18.319
Stand here.

53:18.320 --> 53:19.401
Don't move.

53:20.560 --> 53:23.131
You owe me too much.

53:23.240 --> 53:24.730
You must help this time.

53:30.720 --> 53:31.801
Kill him.

53:32.800 --> 53:33.608
Halt.

53:34.800 --> 53:35.608
Stand still.

53:35.880 --> 53:36.449
Stand still.

53:36.450 --> 53:38.010
No, please.

53:38.920 --> 53:39.842
No.

53:40.240 --> 53:41.765
- I beg you, no.
- 1

53:41.960 --> 53:42.927
I beg you.

53:43.320 --> 53:44.606
- No.
- 2

53:50.640 --> 53:52.449
Officer Wan, it sounds
like gunshots inside.

53:55.280 --> 53:56.606
You wanted to arrest me,

53:56.607 --> 53:57.840
now you want to kill me'?

53:59.000 --> 53:59.967
Let me go see.

54:00.560 --> 54:01.319
Stay calm.

54:01.320 --> 54:03.242
If they find out we're all cops

54:03.243 --> 54:04.002
it will be all over.

54:04.003 --> 54:05.570
What do you want'?

54:08.560 --> 54:09.721
I tell you.

54:12.080 --> 54:14.959
There is 1,EKG of C-4 explosives here.

54:14.960 --> 54:16.769
Go out and tell those dogs

54:16.960 --> 54:19.559
I want the Government buy back

54:19.560 --> 54:21.562
the Western Harbour Crossing
within the next 48 hours.

54:21.800 --> 54:24.559
Otherwise, I will kill the hostages

54:24.560 --> 54:26.608
and blow up this Tunnel

54:27.120 --> 54:29.930
I have no time for jokes

54:30.240 --> 54:32.125
I will tell them your request

54:32.126 --> 54:33.360
after you release the hostages.

54:34.200 --> 54:35.884
What are you talking about?

54:36.200 --> 54:37.439
You come in empty-handed

54:37.440 --> 54:38.919
I didn't get anything

54:38.920 --> 54:40.046
and you ask me to release the hostages?

54:40.047 --> 54:41.319
I'll stay.

54:41.320 --> 54:42.679
So what?

54:42.680 --> 54:45.286
Look around, many hostages
died because of you.

54:46.400 --> 54:48.323
It was you

54:49.560 --> 54:51.324
who brought my brother into jail.

54:52.560 --> 54:53.766
It's time for you

54:54.880 --> 54:56.689
to bring my brother back to me now

54:56.690 --> 54:58.523
for a family reunion.

55:07.800 --> 55:08.642
Well

55:11.600 --> 55:13.329
I'll bring your brother here

55:15.080 --> 55:16.809
then you release 100 hostages

55:16.920 --> 55:18.160
women and children

55:25.640 --> 55:26.846
I promise you

55:28.240 --> 55:29.651
I want to see Biao

55:30.400 --> 55:31.765
before 12 o'clock.

55:32.040 --> 55:33.201
If not

55:33.760 --> 55:35.967
I will kill one hostage every ten minutes.

55:48.600 --> 55:50.999
Work started on this Tunnel in 1969.

55:51.000 --> 55:53.081
At the time, the cost
was about $300 million.

55:53.082 --> 55:56.279
But building a tunnel at
the same location today

55:56.280 --> 55:57.884
we believe the cost will
be several billion dollars.

55:57.960 --> 55:58.643
But if they...

55:58.680 --> 56:00.125
Any reply from Authority?

56:03.760 --> 56:04.602
Continue.

56:05.000 --> 56:06.645
If they really blow up this Tunnel

56:06.646 --> 56:07.641
after the explosion

56:07.642 --> 56:11.159
Victoria Harbour will
become extremely muddied.

56:11.160 --> 56:12.650
It takes at least six
months for the mud and dust

56:12.651 --> 56:14.604
to settle back to the bottom of the sea.

56:14.605 --> 56:17.843
Assuming there is no navigation
by water at that time.

56:17.844 --> 56:20.366
If they really blow up the Tunnel

56:20.680 --> 56:22.045
it will cause at least
hundreds of billions in financial losses

56:22.046 --> 56:23.724
over the next several years

56:23.920 --> 56:25.203
ls there any study of

56:25.204 --> 56:27.646
how much damage this Tunnel can sustain?

56:27.840 --> 56:29.123
Most structures in Hong Kong can

56:29.124 --> 56:31.521
withstand earthquakes of magnitude 6.

56:31.522 --> 56:33.921
But if the Tunnel was
under highest explosives

56:33.922 --> 56:35.285
the case would be different.

56:36.720 --> 56:38.802
C-4 is a high-grade military explosive

56:38.803 --> 56:40.245
containing Hexogen.

56:40.400 --> 56:41.890
If its power is concentrated

56:41.891 --> 56:45.441
1kg can blow up a five-storey building

56:45.960 --> 56:47.610
<i>1 mom...</i>

56:48.000 --> 56:49.684
is enough to blow up the whole Tunnel.

56:49.685 --> 56:50.727
Officer Wan.

56:51.000 --> 56:52.762
There is a website called
"Robin Hood Actions"

56:52.763 --> 56:53.921
it has uploaded hundreds of photos.

56:53.922 --> 56:57.399
These three are retired colleagues of ours.

56:57.400 --> 56:58.561
This police office has just gone off-duty.

56:58.562 --> 56:59.799
They are father and son.

56:59.800 --> 57:01.359
Peng Hong is heartless.

57:01.360 --> 57:02.646
He can never be Robin Hood.

57:05.760 --> 57:06.682
Yes, sir.

57:07.320 --> 57:08.367
Thank you, sir.

57:10.440 --> 57:11.805
For the safety of the hostages.

57:12.360 --> 57:14.806
The Security Bureau
has confirmed to release Biao Hong.

57:24.080 --> 57:25.809
Due to the concern that
the two Harbour Crossings

57:25.810 --> 57:27.450
may become the next target.

57:27.451 --> 57:30.079
Police have shut them down now.

57:30.080 --> 57:31.241
EOD officers with accoutrements

57:31.242 --> 57:33.519
have entered the Tunnels for surveillance.

57:33.520 --> 57:34.931
Currently, all three cross-harbor tunnels

57:34.932 --> 57:36.604
are closed to all traffic

57:36.605 --> 57:38.439
except police vehicles.

57:38.440 --> 57:39.362
Because of the nature of the event,

57:39.363 --> 57:41.966
the MTR will run through the night tonight.

57:42.400 --> 57:43.039
Officer Kong.

57:43.040 --> 57:44.690
Our staff is escorting
Biao Hong coming out.

57:45.560 --> 57:46.447
He's very quiet.

57:47.080 --> 57:48.359
He doesn't like to talk.

57:48.360 --> 57:50.362
He loves to stay in
his cell alone at his free time.

57:50.363 --> 57:52.044
A year ago he found religion.

58:02.400 --> 58:03.845
It's been a long time.

58:04.640 --> 58:05.926
Let's talk inside.

58:11.560 --> 58:15.007
At least tell me where we're going.

58:15.320 --> 58:16.731
Your elder brother is back.

58:18.520 --> 58:20.249
Your brother has seized
the Cross-Harbour Tunnel.

58:20.640 --> 58:22.051
He says he will release

58:22.200 --> 58:23.361
100 hostages if he sees you

58:23.362 --> 58:24.725
I don't want to see him.

58:24.726 --> 58:26.085
I...

58:30.920 --> 58:32.524
I'm sorry...

58:32.960 --> 58:33.882
Sorry.

58:34.960 --> 58:35.882
Sorry

58:39.680 --> 58:41.842
I really don't want to see him.

58:44.200 --> 58:45.122
Yes

58:45.400 --> 58:46.526
I did many bad things

58:46.527 --> 58:48.727
I deserve this punishment

58:48.960 --> 58:50.007
I admit that.

58:50.760 --> 58:52.171
But now I've changed

58:52.920 --> 58:54.203
I'm not who I was before

58:54.204 --> 58:55.611
I've become a better person now

58:56.240 --> 58:58.083
I've learned many things

58:59.120 --> 59:01.119
I don't want to see him

59:01.120 --> 59:02.884
I cannot see him

59:04.760 --> 59:06.239
I'm afraid to see him

59:06.240 --> 59:07.599
I beg you

59:07.600 --> 59:10.080
I beg you, please don't bring me to see him

59:10.920 --> 59:11.967
I know..

59:12.240 --> 59:14.083
My life for 100 hostages,

59:14.280 --> 59:14.929
I...

59:22.160 --> 59:22.839
Yes?

59:22.840 --> 59:23.682
Officer Wan.

59:23.760 --> 59:25.039
Our vehicle was hit

59:25.040 --> 59:25.927
by a drunk truck driver.

59:25.928 --> 59:27.251
An officer is badly hurt.

59:27.252 --> 59:28.366
And Biao Hong?

59:28.840 --> 59:29.804
Biao Hong is also hurt.

59:29.805 --> 59:30.801
He must go to hospital.

59:31.160 --> 59:32.650
Delay Peng Hong.

59:39.880 --> 59:40.679
Speak.

59:40.680 --> 59:42.603
The pick-up of Biao Hong was held up

59:42.720 --> 59:44.639
I don't speak to peons.

59:44.640 --> 59:46.404
Get JS Cheung to speak to me.

59:58.680 --> 01:00:00.523
There's been a car accident on our end.

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:02.523
Your brother is badly hurt

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:05.642
I must send him to hospital, understand?

01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:06.921
I am telling you.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:09.639
Dead or alive.

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.688
If I don't see Biao by 12 o'clock

01:00:11.689 --> 01:00:13.808
I will kill hostages.

01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.287
Go to hospital.

01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:20.521
Bring him out.

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:21.882
Come out.

01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.849
Officer Wan, someone is
coming out of the Tunnel.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:33.328
Don't shoot...

01:00:35.120 --> 01:00:35.959
<i>No.</i>

01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:38.042
Don't shoot.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.321
Don't shoot.

01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:40.686
No...

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:53.439
In ten minutes, if I don't see Biao

01:00:53.440 --> 01:00:55.283
I'll kill the next one.

01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:04.526
They've killed a hostage.

01:01:04.527 --> 01:01:05.931
Bring Biao Hong immediately.

01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:14.081
Lift him up

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.530
1,2,3

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.006
Move back, go.

01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.405
Two more minutes.

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.719
Biao Hong is here.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.210
He said, Biao Hong is here.

01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:30.646
Peng Hong.

01:02:31.040 --> 01:02:32.405
Your brother is here.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:38.327
Get going.

01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:39.049
Okay.

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:39.919
Get out.

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:40.842
Go!

01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:44.519
Don't shoot

01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:45.839
I'm a hostage.

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.285
- I'm a hostage.
- Hold on.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.162
He wants to Facetime with
the man in the ambulance.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:04.206
Officer Wan, we've checked him out.

01:03:04.207 --> 01:03:05.725
Nothing suspicious.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.165
Release the hostages now.

01:03:33.920 --> 01:03:34.719
Get out.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:35.323
What are you doing?

01:03:35.324 --> 01:03:36.287
We're letting you go.

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:37.566
Can you let my wife go too?

01:03:37.567 --> 01:03:38.599
Only you can go.

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:39.159
Daddy“.

01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:39.886
- Get out.
- Sit tight.

01:03:39.887 --> 01:03:40.765
- Be brave.
- Don't take my dad!

01:03:40.766 --> 01:03:41.568
Mind your own business.

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:42.449
Go.

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:43.888
Go this way.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.128
Go this way.

01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.159
Now we can see

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:52.039
dozens of hostages have been released.

01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.084
The police on site

01:03:53.085 --> 01:03:55.367
are leading them out of the blockade.

01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:56.966
The hostages are trickling
out of the tunnel.

01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:58.799
No hurry.

01:03:58.800 --> 01:03:59.801
One by one

01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.959
47, 48

01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:06.689
Officer Wan, he's only
released 50 hostages.

01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.647
That's not enough.

01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:09.725
All young men.

01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:11.807
Look at me.

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:14.760
Peng Hong.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.681
You promised to let 100 hostages go.

01:04:17.682 --> 01:04:19.799
You bring Biao in alone

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.723
and I'll release 50 more.

01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:33.647
Come and help.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.008
Come here.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:45.842
Biao.

01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.322
Biao.

01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:48.767
Hang in there

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.365
I'll get you out soon.

01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:54.721
Let the hostages go.

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.320
Release 50 hostages.

01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:10.839
You may 90

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.001
I'll contact you.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.919
- Stay inside the car.
- Okay.

01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:19.841
Stay inside the car

01:05:19.842 --> 01:05:22.319
I'll give you money, please let me go.

01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:23.560
Please...

01:05:24.800 --> 01:05:25.767
Please.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:27.449
You come out.

01:05:27.450 --> 01:05:28.202
Now.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.124
Now...

01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:32.759
Get out.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:34.762
No, I must stay and take care of them.

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:36.086
- Go.
- Please let me do my job.

01:05:36.087 --> 01:05:36.729
Please! It's my duty.

01:05:36.730 --> 01:05:37.687
Get out.

01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:39.404
Get out.

01:05:39.405 --> 01:05:40.401
Where will you take him?

01:05:40.402 --> 01:05:41.049
Go.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:45.839
Come out.

01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:46.682
Go.

01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.321
Keep going.

01:06:08.640 --> 01:06:09.801
- Hurry.
- Don't look back.

01:06:09.802 --> 01:06:10.439
Hurry.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.122
It has been three hours since

01:06:12.123 --> 01:06:13.765
the Tunnel Hostage Incident began.

01:06:13.766 --> 01:06:16.283
The police are revealing
very limited information

01:06:16.284 --> 01:06:18.564
in order to protect the
safety of the hostages.

01:06:18.565 --> 01:06:20.130
Some people have discovered a website

01:06:20.131 --> 01:06:22.119
called "Robin Hood Actions"

01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.723
that has uploaded photos
of possible hostages.

01:06:24.724 --> 01:06:27.765
Some family members are
at the police station.

01:06:27.766 --> 01:06:30.604
Let's look at the Kowloon
entrance of the Tunnel.

01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:45.999
Yes

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:47.604
lam very happy to be reunited

01:06:47.605 --> 01:06:48.965
with my brother

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:52.439
I will let go one more hostage for you.

01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:54.408
Don't shoot.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.161
He's one of us

01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.288
I have a bomb tied to me.

01:07:01.840 --> 01:07:03.599
Everyone, freeze.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.567
Stand still

01:07:17.280 --> 01:07:19.169
lam JS Cheung of EOD

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.688
I am UI 19472.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:29.559
Don't worry.

01:07:29.560 --> 01:07:31.005
The timer isn't on.

01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.641
Stay calm.

01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:35.607
Very calm

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.726
I'll keep that for you.

01:07:45.240 --> 01:07:46.079
EOD

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:47.081
support Officer Cheung.

01:07:47.082 --> 01:07:47.808
Yes, sir.

01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:52.448
Officer Cheung.

01:07:53.640 --> 01:07:54.721
Is it hard to disarm?

01:07:54.722 --> 01:07:55.607
Don't worry

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:56.721
I'll do my best

01:07:57.400 --> 01:07:58.890
I've been professionally trained.

01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:00.962
You can tell me anything directly.

01:08:00.963 --> 01:08:02.086
Wait for your orders here.

01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:05.002
There are four groups of explosives on you.

01:08:05.003 --> 01:08:06.764
So there are 16 different combinations.

01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:08.999
That means I must out 8 wires

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.331
and they all must be the correct ones.

01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:11.682
Officer Cheung.

01:08:11.920 --> 01:08:13.046
Flashlight

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:31.441
I'll start now.

01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:33.322
Yes.

01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.399
You're quite calm.

01:09:02.399 --> 01:09:03.685
My dad taught me

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.122
not to be afraid of anything.

01:09:05.124 --> 01:09:05.924
He's a policeman too.

01:09:05.925 --> 01:09:07.604
He taught me to have courage in everything.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.683
Officer Cheung, the timer has started.

01:09:20.399 --> 01:09:21.322
What's wrong?

01:09:23.160 --> 01:09:23.921
Nothing.

01:09:26.080 --> 01:09:27.286
Is it hard to disarm?

01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:30.211
How can this be?

01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.158
Is it hard to disarm?

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:32.888
Ben.

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.279
Retreat 50 meters.

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:36.281
Officer Cheung, there's not enough time.

01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.608
Yes, sir.

01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.450
- Retreat?
- All units, fall bk 50 meters.

01:09:42.451 --> 01:09:44.602
Everyone back up 50 meters, now!

01:09:44.603 --> 01:09:46.363
Hurry! Retreat 50 meters.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.323
How can I help you?

01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:49.883
Or shall I just stand?

01:09:49.884 --> 01:09:50.529
Move back!

01:09:50.529 --> 01:09:52.283
Everyone stays calm.

01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.571
The cars at the entrance
are full of gasoline.

01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:55.921
Have the Fire Brigade on standby

01:09:55.922 --> 01:09:57.231
lam very calm now.

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.679
How can I help?

01:09:58.680 --> 01:09:59.279
I...

01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.088
Officer Cheung, must go.

01:10:00.089 --> 01:10:01.127
Out of time now!

01:10:01.128 --> 01:10:03.439
I'm very calm

01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:04.930
I'm fine.

01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:06.206
How much time is left?

01:10:06.207 --> 01:10:07.406
How many wires?

01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:14.559
Hurry...

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:15.639
I beg you.

01:10:15.640 --> 01:10:17.599
Save me please, I beg you.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.807
Please hurry...

01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:28.881
You are a policeman.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:30.690
You have responsibilities.

01:10:31.520 --> 01:10:32.681
Stay away from people.

01:10:32.682 --> 01:10:33.761
Don't go near cars.

01:10:33.762 --> 01:10:34.886
Stay where you are

01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:36.161
to minimize casualties.

01:10:36.162 --> 01:10:37.286
Understood?

01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:42.001
You are a policeman.

01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:43.366
You have responsibilities.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:45.006
Stay away from people.

01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.601
Don't go near cars.

01:10:46.602 --> 01:10:48.762
Stay where you are to minimize casualties.

01:10:48.763 --> 01:10:49.966
Understood?

01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:53.329
Yes, sir.

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:55.130
Do you know, you are a policeman?

01:10:55.131 --> 01:10:56.399
Yes, sir.

01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.004
Do you know your responsibilities?

01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:00.564
Tell me, what are your responsibilities?

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.562
Say it

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.849
lam a policeman.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.284
My responsibilities are

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:09.729
to stay away from cars

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.684
stay away from people

01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:15.051
to minimize casualties

01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:19.208
lam a policeman.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.079
Stay away from people.

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.839
Stay away from cars

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:25.922
to minimize casualties.

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:41.562
That day, I watched as
you arrested my brother.

01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.848
Now you know how helpless I was,

01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:46.324
how hopeless I felt.

01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:31.922
Officer Wan.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.563
A grief counselor has been sent here.

01:13:33.564 --> 01:13:34.527
Tell him to leave.

01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:38.286
Take him away

01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:40.131
I said, "Go away"

01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.599
I don't have any mental problem.

01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:44.841
Why would I need a psychiatrist?

01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.084
I've seen Psychiatrist before.

01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:22.251
It doesn't help

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:28.607
I understand.

01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:30.687
What do you understand?

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:33.999
Since Peng Hong escaped

01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.604
I had nightmares every night

01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:39.519
of my men being killed by bombs.

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.648
Recently I've dreamed of Officer Chow.

01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:54.847
Do me a favor.

01:14:55.520 --> 01:14:56.681
Keep it to yourself

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.568
I don't want to be an "office" Officer yet.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.799
What a narrow escape!

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.881
Don't forget to buy a lottery ticket.

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:20.608
Officer.

01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:22.439
Excuse me, I need to piss so badly.

01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:23.805
- On our way, sit down first.
- I can't head it anymore

01:15:23.806 --> 01:15:24.926
I must go now.

01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:27.127
What are you doing?

01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:31.882
Freeze.

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.599
Head down.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:38.559
Get down.

01:15:39.520 --> 01:15:41.204
Sit down! Don't look!

01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:43.599
Everybody down!

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:44.408
Yes.

01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:46.247
Thank you.

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.244
Something's happened to
the bus with the hostages.

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:49.724
Those scumbags are mixed with the hostages

01:15:49.725 --> 01:15:51.529
3 injured policemen are on the way
to Accident & Emergency.

01:15:51.530 --> 01:15:53.039
They are preparing to retreat.

01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:54.166
They may have other arrangements.

01:15:54.167 --> 01:15:55.844
Can we quit dragging our feet?

01:15:55.845 --> 01:15:56.887
Take action!

01:15:57.360 --> 01:15:58.805
Besides the hostage issue.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.811
We still have to confirm

01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:03.401
the location of the 1,000kg of C-4.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:04.801
Those explosives

01:16:04.802 --> 01:16:06.723
could be in one of the trucks.

01:16:06.724 --> 01:16:08.131
Or both

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:09.887
I think Blast used the trucks

01:16:09.888 --> 01:16:12.879
to block both the entrances on purpose

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:14.609
because C-4 has directionality.

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:16.723
If both sides explode at the same time,

01:16:16.800 --> 01:16:19.371
the power of the explosion is pointing to
the middle of the Tunnel

01:16:19.372 --> 01:16:20.799
when two shock waves collide.

01:16:20.800 --> 01:16:22.529
There is a good chance the
Tunnel will break apart.

01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:26.126
Interpol has responded.

01:16:26.127 --> 01:16:28.005
The photo we sent to them two days ago

01:16:28.006 --> 01:16:30.239
of the bomb Officer Cheung took in Wanchai,

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:31.526
has a similar design to the device

01:16:31.527 --> 01:16:33.761
used by terrorists to attack a bar

01:16:33.762 --> 01:16:34.966
in Djakarta last year.

01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:37.407
Intelligence shows that.

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.009
Peng Hong had been in the Golden Triangle

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.721
delivering morphine and
heroin for drug dealers.

01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:44.805
He has a crew of mercenaries.

01:16:44.806 --> 01:16:47.403
Who cares about the
faraway Golden Triangle.

01:16:47.404 --> 01:16:49.880
Let's deal with the
Cross-Harbour Tunnel first.

01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:53.801
Sorry, Sir.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:55.851
Before sunrise, try your
best to lift the ban

01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:57.443
of both the Eastern and
Western Harbour Crossings.

01:16:57.444 --> 01:16:58.771
Otherwise, when morning rush starts

01:16:58.772 --> 01:17:00.649
Hong Kong will be in disorder.

01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:25.681
Have some water.

01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:28.408
Take your death offerings.

01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:30.367
Take your death offerings.

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.246
The Cross-Harbour Tunnel Hostage Incident

01:17:36.247 --> 01:17:38.119
is in its tenth hour.

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.279
As yet there is no sign of resolution.

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:41.167
As we can see on screen

01:17:41.168 --> 01:17:44.323
the police have reopened
the other two Harbour Crossings

01:17:44.324 --> 01:17:47.679
but roadblocks have been set up

01:17:47.680 --> 01:17:48.919
at all entrances.

01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:50.921
All vehicles going into the Crossings

01:17:50.922 --> 01:17:52.729
must go through the surveillance.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.121
Buy back?

01:17:54.520 --> 01:17:56.761
The market value of my company's tunnel

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:59.287
is estimated to be about $10 billion.

01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:01.563
If you want to fully acquire

01:18:01.564 --> 01:18:05.159
all the shares in the market

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.799
and get it done within 48 hours.

01:18:08.800 --> 01:18:10.844
The only way is to buy at any cost.

01:18:10.845 --> 01:18:13.320
If the share price of Man Chung
shows extraordinary movement

01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:15.010
would you apply to the
SFC to suspend trading?

01:18:15.011 --> 01:18:17.039
Why would I suspend trading?

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.999
As the Chairman of Man Chung

01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.765
my top priority is my
shareholders' benefits.

01:18:21.960 --> 01:18:23.399
And besides

01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:25.004
this would be good bullish news.

01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:26.966
Of course.

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.966
Mr. Yim, you are the biggest shareholder.

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.040
Would your benefits

01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.082
be your top priority?

01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.042
If Man Chung's share prices rise sharply

01:18:41.043 --> 01:18:43.042
and you'll look to sell
a great deal of stocks

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.805
please notify the police
as soon as possible.

01:18:44.806 --> 01:18:47.246
If the Government is determined to buy back

01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:49.205
I also hope to find out

01:18:49.206 --> 01:18:50.964
as soon as possible

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:53.085
Chet Sook.

01:18:53.086 --> 01:18:55.161
This morning the five
major securities firms

01:18:55.162 --> 01:18:56.839
have issued many At-Auction Orders

01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:58.649
and buying back Man Chung
shares at high prices.

01:18:58.650 --> 01:18:59.641
Since the market opened,

01:18:59.642 --> 01:19:01.919
Man Chung's share price has soared.

01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.126
Let's take a closer look into the case.

01:19:03.127 --> 01:19:06.282
Obviously, the Tunnel Incident
has a great influence on the market.

01:19:06.283 --> 01:19:08.439
Man Chung owns the Western
Harbour Crosssing

01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:09.930
and the Cross-Harbour
Tunnel is being attacked

01:19:09.931 --> 01:19:12.319
the traffic flow at Western Harbour Cross.

01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.163
Even if the market has a strong
reactioning is increasing significantly

01:19:14.164 --> 01:19:15.922
to catch up with the stock of Man Chung

01:19:15.923 --> 01:19:17.160
it would be quite normal.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:19.288
Last night, some colleagues
were already planning

01:19:19.289 --> 01:19:20.959
to start stocking up.

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:22.845
Look at the trading volume this morning.

01:19:22.846 --> 01:19:25.161
There should be lots of speculative trades

01:19:25.162 --> 01:19:27.719
for the prices to soar in that way.

01:19:27.720 --> 01:19:28.881
So in your judgment

01:19:28.882 --> 01:19:31.611
will the SFC demands a
suspension of trading?

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.761
This is just a one-off incident.

01:19:33.762 --> 01:19:36.443
The SFC can only demand
an explanation from Man Chung.

01:19:36.444 --> 01:19:38.124
They have no right to suspend its trading.

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.002
Give it to me.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.359
It's worthless.

01:20:03.360 --> 01:20:03.999
Sir

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.525
take mine, it's new.

01:20:05.880 --> 01:20:06.881
Take my watch.

01:20:09.880 --> 01:20:10.767
Give it to me.

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:27.165
This watch is for you.

01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:38.090
Why are you giving a watch...

01:20:38.920 --> 01:20:40.843
to someone who does not have time?

01:20:40.844 --> 01:20:42.439
You have plenty of time.

01:20:42.440 --> 01:20:43.879
Some of my men

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:46.406
have left last night
along with the hostages.

01:20:47.360 --> 01:20:50.807
They will arrange
helicopters to pick us up.

01:20:51.720 --> 01:20:53.006
What if we can't leave?

01:20:53.440 --> 01:20:55.169
If we really can't leave

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:58.443
I'll blow up this Tunnel.

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:01.727
Brother.

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.091
Stop that.

01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.009
Turn yourself in, please

01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.207
I went through so much to get you out

01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:13.319
hoping to have a reunion.

01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.209
That's what you wanted.

01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:19.439
Do you care about my needs?

01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:22.245
Since childhood, you just
think of what you want.

01:21:22.246 --> 01:21:23.969
We did whatever you wished.

01:21:23.970 --> 01:21:25.039
What about me?

01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:28.119
Have you ever asked what I want?

01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:29.565
I don't want to go with you

01:21:29.566 --> 01:21:31.879
I just want to go to hospital.

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:33.765
Do you know what you're saying?

01:21:33.766 --> 01:21:35.250
You are my only brother.

01:21:35.251 --> 01:21:36.519
Dead or alive.

01:21:36.520 --> 01:21:37.959
You must stay with me.

01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:38.919
It's a must.

01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:41.969
Peng Hong...

01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:45.399
You go to hell

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:47.759
lam not leaving with you.

01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:49.842
Go to hell.

01:21:52.720 --> 01:21:54.722
Go to hell.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:57.642
Go to hell.

01:21:58.720 --> 01:22:01.039
Go to hell...

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:01.919
Save them...

01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.159
At 3PM today.

01:22:03.160 --> 01:22:05.279
Some families of the
Tunnel Incident victims

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:06.803
are petitioning at the
Central Government Offices

01:22:06.804 --> 01:22:08.211
to demand the immediate
rescue of the hostages.

01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:10.842
As the Police are behaving passively

01:22:10.843 --> 01:22:13.319
it is believed the government
is helpless in this matter.

01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:16.159
Affected by this incident

01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:18.364
the Hong Kong stock market
has taken a downturn.

01:22:18.365 --> 01:22:20.727
The Hang Seng Index had
dropped about 1,000 points.

01:22:20.728 --> 01:22:22.279
But the day's turnover

01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:24.919
had reached a record-breaking $16 billion

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:26.365
40% of which was from the
trading of Man Chung.

01:22:26.366 --> 01:22:29.523
Man Chung is the owner
of the Western Harbour Crossing.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:31.322
Man Chung bucked the
trend and soared today.

01:22:31.323 --> 01:22:32.242
When the market closed,

01:22:32.243 --> 01:22:34.004
the stock soared nearly four times.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:39.719
Hello?

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:43.599
Boss, when will I get my money?

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:46.251
I will wire the final $500
million to you tonight.

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:48.167
But

01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:50.530
I would like to have the stock price

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.689
to go up even harder.

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:10.968
Officer Wan.

01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:12.645
Blast has posted a message.

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:14.165
He said if we don't cooperate

01:23:14.166 --> 01:23:15.399
they will kill hostages

01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:16.890
and even blow up the whole Tunnel.

01:23:17.520 --> 01:23:18.601
If you're calling for Carmen

01:23:18.602 --> 01:23:19.759
this is Carmen.

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.888
Please leave a message after the beep.

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:23.807
It's me

01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:26.289
I'm just calling to say hello.

01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:50.770
Your girlfriend

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:51.967
looks

01:23:52.880 --> 01:23:54.723
so graceful and elegant.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.282
Where is she?

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:00.530
In Hong Kong.

01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.639
Do you remember how good
I was to you before

01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:06.449
and what had you done in return?

01:24:07.200 --> 01:24:08.531
What do you want'?

01:24:09.080 --> 01:24:10.684
I want you to remember for
the rest of your life

01:24:10.685 --> 01:24:12.364
how you betrayed your brothers.

01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:16.039
On the day we robbed the bank vault.

01:24:16.040 --> 01:24:19.601
My men and I taught you
how to make a car bomb

01:24:20.600 --> 01:24:22.639
and put them in three taxis.

01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:25.849
You, such a dedicated traitor

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:28.919
must have told your bosses

01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:30.763
the three license plate numbers.

01:24:31.160 --> 01:24:32.839
Do you still remember

01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:34.410
those numbers?

01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:35.728
Hello?

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:37.688
Hello!

01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:58.691
DB

01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:03.366
EC

01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:08.330
FA 969

01:25:14.600 --> 01:25:15.522
Officer.

01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:17.084
What happened?

01:25:17.085 --> 01:25:18.241
Here's what happened:

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:20.170
The taxi driver stopped his car

01:25:20.171 --> 01:25:21.239
and ran off

01:25:21.240 --> 01:25:23.045
I thought he went to the restroom

01:25:23.046 --> 01:25:24.644
but he still hasn't come back.

01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:26.728
Sir.

01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:27.728
Sir.

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:29.608
Thank you.

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:44.602
Freeze.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.161
Don't move.

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:51.724
Calling control

01:25:51.725 --> 01:25:53.927
hand grenade was found
in Shek Mun gas station.

01:25:55.680 --> 01:25:57.250
Keep at least 100 meters
away from the gas station.

01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:58.403
Prepare me a sand bag trench.

01:25:58.404 --> 01:25:59.447
Evacuate everyone nearby.

01:25:59.448 --> 01:26:00.239
No problem.

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:02.368
What happened?

01:26:02.600 --> 01:26:04.282
I will out your wrist and ankle straps

01:26:04.283 --> 01:26:05.805
and take you away from the gas station.

01:26:06.880 --> 01:26:08.323
Hold tight onto the grenade.

01:26:08.324 --> 01:26:10.448
Don't let go and you'll be fine.
Understand?

01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:15.886
Do you understand?

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.806
You will be safe.

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.167
Hold tight.

01:26:45.560 --> 01:26:46.800
Let go.

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:55.727
You're fine.

01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:57.322
Be brave

01:26:58.720 --> 01:26:59.881
I'll get you out of this.

01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:12.164
When they are ready

01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.570
I will go with you.

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:19.450
Together, we will put the grenade
in the sand bag trench

01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:20.807
and run.

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.321
Are you clear'?

01:27:25.160 --> 01:27:26.239
I can't do this.

01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:27.730
You can if you trust me.

01:27:28.360 --> 01:27:29.805
You can if you trust me.

01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:31.805
The trench is ready.

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:35.680
We will do it together.

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:39.165
Can I really do it?

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:42.567
Trust me.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:49.047
But what if?

01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.925
Do you have anything to say to me?

01:27:51.926 --> 01:27:53.160
What do you want me to say?

01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:57.004
Those words that women want to hear

01:28:06.440 --> 01:28:08.169
I will take the tape off

01:28:09.560 --> 01:28:10.763
I will count:1, 2, 3.

01:28:10.764 --> 01:28:12.683
Release the grenade and we'll run.

01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:13.807
Is that clear?

01:28:29.160 --> 01:28:30.082
All right

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:38.167
3, let go.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:41.402
Run.

01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:10.284
We must find another way
instead of waiting.

01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.769
Watch for the right moment and make a move.

01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:23.605
This is Day 3 of the
Tunnel Hostage Incident.

01:29:23.606 --> 01:29:25.884
Per "Robin Hood Actions",
the website probably

01:29:25.885 --> 01:29:28.039
set up by the criminals, the ultimate goal

01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:29.246
of the criminals is the Government

01:29:29.247 --> 01:29:32.399
buy-back of the Man Chung-owned
Western Harbour Crossing.

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.446
- Or they will blow up this Tunnel.
- Thanks for your hard work...

01:29:34.447 --> 01:29:35.248
- Excuse me.
- Mr. Yim...

01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:36.564
Sorry but I have no statement to make.

01:29:36.565 --> 01:29:37.844
Has any authority mentioned to you

01:29:37.845 --> 01:29:39.683
about the buy-back of the
Western Harbour Crossing?

01:29:39.684 --> 01:29:41.799
Sorry, no comment.

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:43.006
Mr. Yim, in this hostage crisis

01:29:43.007 --> 01:29:44.762
how much blood money did you make?

01:29:44.763 --> 01:29:46.283
Which paper are you represented?

01:29:46.284 --> 01:29:47.563
I am a legitimate businessman.

01:29:47.564 --> 01:29:49.005
You know I can sue you for libel.

01:29:49.006 --> 01:29:49.959
Mr. Secretary.

01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:52.439
It is said the government
has bought back numerous

01:29:52.440 --> 01:29:54.404
shares of Man Chung through
five investment banks.

01:29:54.405 --> 01:29:55.759
How would you respond to that?

01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:56.886
Mr. Secretary, please respond.

01:29:56.887 --> 01:29:57.767
Thank you

01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:00.127
I doubt about the source of these rumors.

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.805
And I have nothing to comment

01:30:01.806 --> 01:30:03.370
regarding those issues.

01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:05.279
Once again I state.

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:08.122
The government will not
yield to any vicious power.

01:30:08.123 --> 01:30:10.925
Looking at the trades
yesterday and this morning.

01:30:10.926 --> 01:30:13.399
Man Chung's market value has hit 20
30 billion.

01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.402
If one had invested in its derivatives

01:30:15.680 --> 01:30:17.523
the returns would be incredible!

01:30:20.720 --> 01:30:22.290
Here is a new job for you.

01:30:31.560 --> 01:30:32.561
You will be all right

01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.046
I have to go back to the scene now.

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.281
Wait for me to come back.

01:30:42.680 --> 01:30:43.522
Okay

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:46.448
I wait for your return
and tell me those words.

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:09.684
Alright. I have to go.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.161
Take care of her for me.

01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:29.327
Yes, sir

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:01.766
ls your girlfriend okay?

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:02.922
She's fine.

01:32:04.240 --> 01:32:05.599
Any new plan?

01:32:05.600 --> 01:32:07.682
For me, I definitely would
make a strong assault.

01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:09.160
You must think I am insane.

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:45.839
Don't shoot.

01:32:45.840 --> 01:32:46.966
- Please don't shoot.
- Come out

01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:03.447
Robin Hood says,
wire $1 billion more to his account.

01:33:03.448 --> 01:33:04.327
What?

01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.162
Hurry UP.

01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:10.841
Do you need another shot?

01:33:10.842 --> 01:33:12.205
Don't, please.

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:20.639
Done.

01:33:20.640 --> 01:33:22.130
Banked into your account already.

01:33:29.720 --> 01:33:31.006
Open the door.

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:33.126
Open the door.

01:33:44.240 --> 01:33:45.799
Are you ready?

01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:47.799
Yes, the choppers are coming.

01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:48.687
Copy.

01:33:51.720 --> 01:33:55.079
General, we are setting off in an hour.

01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:57.241
When you enter the uncontrolled airspace,

01:33:57.242 --> 01:33:58.924
my men will take care of you.

01:33:58.925 --> 01:33:59.648
Copy.

01:34:05.040 --> 01:34:07.008
They are coming to pick us up.

01:34:07.240 --> 01:34:09.163
You'll see hot nurses soon.

01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:19.082
It's Blast.

01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:22.127
Officer Cheung.

01:34:24.080 --> 01:34:27.607
This is the remote detonator
for the whole Tunnel.

01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:30.919
In 60 minutes

01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:32.001
it will blow out.

01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:34.519
In 20 minutes

01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:36.679
two helicopters will pick us up.

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:38.119
If you try to stop us

01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:39.929
I will kill the hostages.

01:34:40.240 --> 01:34:43.528
As long as we safely leave
Hong Kong air space

01:34:44.640 --> 01:34:45.879
I will

01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:47.405
switch off the remote.

01:34:48.840 --> 01:34:50.604
But when we board the helicopter

01:34:50.800 --> 01:34:52.962
I must take a few hostages with me

01:34:53.240 --> 01:34:54.321
and one of them

01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:55.921
is you.

01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.291
JS Cheung.

01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:21.328
Island units, stand by.

01:35:22.360 --> 01:35:23.441
Island units copy.

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:47.323
Freeze.

01:35:49.720 --> 01:35:51.119
Move...

01:35:51.120 --> 01:35:51.839
Back off.

01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:52.682
Drop the remote.

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.011
- Unless you want to die.
- Drop the gun.

01:35:55.012 --> 01:35:56.239
- Shut up.
- Drop the remote.

01:35:56.240 --> 01:35:57.765
Come on if you have a death-wish.

01:35:57.766 --> 01:35:58.719
Drop it now.

01:35:58.720 --> 01:36:00.165
Stay back if you wanna live.

01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.161
Shut up.

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:04.647
Come on.

01:36:06.120 --> 01:36:07.042
Come on.

01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:09.004
Come on over if you want to die.

01:36:09.005 --> 01:36:11.002
Come on.

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:24.330
Hand over the remote.

01:36:28.040 --> 01:36:29.007
Blow it up.

01:36:30.400 --> 01:36:31.079
Do it.

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:31.967
All right.

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:41.964
Everybody can go

01:36:43.520 --> 01:36:44.646
except you.

01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:47.999
Sorry, Boss

01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:50.367
I came here for the money, not to die

01:36:51.120 --> 01:36:52.087
I'm out.

01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:56.765
Get him back.

01:37:00.800 --> 01:37:01.528
Go.

01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:06.079
Island units, go!

01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:07.002
Go.

01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:24.761
Take back the remote.

01:37:24.762 --> 01:37:25.839
Sir, please go out.

01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:26.841
We can handle the situation here.

01:37:29.920 --> 01:37:31.285
Get back...

01:37:39.760 --> 01:37:41.205
Go towards Kowloon.

01:37:44.360 --> 01:37:45.247
Go.

01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:47.609
Go...

01:37:50.720 --> 01:37:52.802
Move towards Kowloon.

01:37:53.920 --> 01:37:54.648
Move.

01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:00.769
Squat down.

01:38:07.120 --> 01:38:08.599
Single file.

01:38:08.600 --> 01:38:09.681
Slowly.

01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.127
Slowly.

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:43.281
Don't Shoot.

01:39:05.320 --> 01:39:06.207
Move.

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:39.643
Out of the car, move that way.

01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:59.210
Move.

01:40:01.800 --> 01:40:03.529
O Lord, forgive my iniquity.

01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:15.602
Be careful.

01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:20.690
Help.

01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:34.727
Scum.

01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:42.125
Continue to evacuate the hostages.

01:40:49.560 --> 01:40:52.006
You shot my leg, so I shot yours.

01:40:53.720 --> 01:40:54.607
Get down.

01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:35.640
Bastard

01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:53.840
I'll kill you, traitor to your brothers

01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:55.319
I was never your brother.

01:41:55.320 --> 01:41:56.242
You are a thief

01:41:56.520 --> 01:41:57.567
I'm a cop.

01:41:58.400 --> 01:41:59.726
Even if I died ten times over

01:41:59.727 --> 01:42:01.210
I would still arrest you.

01:42:02.600 --> 01:42:04.045
Traitor.

01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:06.564
<i>I'll</i> kill you today.

01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:08.321
If I cannot get away

01:42:08.322 --> 01:42:10.129
I will take you out with me.

01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:58.121
Get out!

01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:02.447
Get out!

01:43:02.840 --> 01:43:04.239
Get out, scumbag.

01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:05.002
Come out!

01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:07.522
Come out!

01:43:09.680 --> 01:43:10.681
- Scumbag.
- Stop.

01:43:10.682 --> 01:43:11.319
Scumbag.

01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:12.765
Stop.

01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:13.999
Freeze.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:15.001
We are running out of time.

01:43:15.240 --> 01:43:16.730
The remote has been destroyed.

01:43:16.731 --> 01:43:18.324
Evacuate everyone

01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:27.448
Ben.

01:43:27.680 --> 01:43:29.091
The bombs cannot be stopped

01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:30.999
I will go to the Hong Kong entrance.

01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:32.764
You examine the truck
at the Kowloon entrance.

01:43:32.765 --> 01:43:33.329
COPY

01:43:33.720 --> 01:43:34.403
Move it, quickly.

01:43:34.404 --> 01:43:35.367
Be quick, go.

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:27.919
Come down.

01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:28.842
Give me your hand.

01:44:33.360 --> 01:44:34.679
Hurry to evacuate.

01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:36.330
Evacuate everybody from here.

01:44:36.331 --> 01:44:37.446
Hurry UP.

01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:48.522
Under the truck.

01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:04.124
Get out quickly, we're running out of time.

01:45:04.125 --> 01:45:04.719
And you?

01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:05.926
Evacuate everyone, quickly.

01:45:06.320 --> 01:45:07.279
Hurry.

01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:08.845
- Everyone out.
- This way...

01:45:08.846 --> 01:45:09.362
Hurry up.

01:45:09.363 --> 01:45:09.963
Come here.

01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:10.759
This way.

01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:11.761
One by one.

01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:13.247
Sir, what about you?

01:45:13.248 --> 01:45:14.446
Hurry up.

01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:16.282
This way...

01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:36.241
Calling Ben.

01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:38.091
Have you found

01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:39.999
the detonating device?

01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.240
I've found it, it's under the truck

01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:42.566
I don't know how to disarm it.

01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:24.727
Go

01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:43.968
Ben.

01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:46.001
Look at your phone.

01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:53.645
Do you have the same device?

01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:56.011
Yes, they are the same.

01:46:56.040 --> 01:46:57.121
Give me a minute.

01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:03.441
Calling Officer Wan

01:47:03.442 --> 01:47:04.119
Roger

01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:05.765
ls the tunnel engineer still there?

01:47:05.766 --> 01:47:06.727
I'll get him now.

01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:07.960
Get the tunnel engineer.

01:47:07.961 --> 01:47:08.722
- Hurry up.
- Yes, sir.

01:47:11.720 --> 01:47:13.165
Attention, all units.

01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:15.847
Everyone must leave the Tunnel immediately.

01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:19.444
Attention, all units.

01:47:19.680 --> 01:47:22.047
Everybody must leave the Tunnel now.

01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:29.965
- Evacuate.
- Evacuate now.

01:47:29.966 --> 01:47:30.879
Evacuate.

01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.006
Evacuate now.

01:47:33.440 --> 01:47:34.726
Yes, Officer Cheung?

01:47:34.727 --> 01:47:36.449
<i>1 mom oi 0-4</i>

01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:38.722
can blow up the whole Tunnel.

01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:42.644
How about 500kg?

01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:46.844
Can the Tunnel sustain
the explosion of 500kg?

01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:51.802
Can the Tunnel sustain the shock wave?

01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:55.082
It should not affect the infrastructure.

01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:56.321
Thank you.

01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:29.846
Calling Ben

01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:31.321
Roger, Officer Cheung

01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.401
I don't have a clear view of the device

01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:36.279
I only see

01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:38.044
a red wire and a yellow wire.

01:48:40.440 --> 01:48:41.726
Would you pick the red

01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:44.200
or the yellow one?

01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:46.450
Officer Cheung,
lam afraid I'll make the wrong choice.

01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:48.041
All right.

01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:49.761
Then I will choose

01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:56.284
I will count to three

01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:58.765
I will out the yellow one.

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:00.925
If it doesn't explode

01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:03.283
follow my lead to cut the yellow one.

01:49:04.320 --> 01:49:05.526
Is that clear?

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:08.004
Officer Cheung...

01:49:08.005 --> 01:49:09.525
If there is an explosion

01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:12.370
cut the red one.

01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:14.246
Is that clear?

01:49:16.680 --> 01:49:17.727
Yes, sir

01:49:58.160 --> 01:49:59.161

01:50:00.400 --> 01:50:01.686

Through the efforts of
all units of the Police.
