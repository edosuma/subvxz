WEBVTT

00:10.577 --> 00:12.412
(nervous breathing)

00:12.645 --> 00:14.614
Sorry.

00:14.914 --> 00:17.484
I'm a... nervous flyer.

00:17.917 --> 00:19.486
Yes, I see.

00:19.986 --> 00:22.489
Oh, you're white as a sheet.

00:22.489 --> 00:26.326
Actually,
I'm always this pale.

00:26.593 --> 00:28.595
My ex-wife used to say
she could tell

00:29.162 --> 00:32.031
when I was embarrassed
because I'd turn off-white
.

00:32.465 --> 00:33.533
I can empathize.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.468
Sometimes after a late night,

00:35.468 --> 00:38.872
I've covered my undereye circles with Liquid Paper.

00:39.272 --> 00:40.840
(chuckles)

00:41.241 --> 00:42.809
So, are you traveling to Seattle

00:42.809 --> 00:43.810
for business
or pleasure?

00:44.310 --> 00:45.311
Both, hopefully.

00:45.311 --> 00:46.579
I'm relocating for work.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.348
How about you?

00:48.348 --> 00:50.750
I need to ask an old friend
for a favor.

00:51.084 --> 00:54.087
Hmm. It's a long trip
just to ask for a favor.

00:54.454 --> 00:56.823
It's a big favor.

00:57.023 --> 00:59.092
Well, I hope
your friend complies.

00:59.492 --> 01:01.961
It'll take some work,
but I'll get what I want
.

01:02.295 --> 01:03.363
Oh, dear.

01:03.363 --> 01:07.200
You two look
awfully pale.

01:07.200 --> 01:08.835
Can I bring you something?

01:09.102 --> 01:10.170
Not unless you have

01:10.170 --> 01:11.671
any extra melanin lying around.

01:11.671 --> 01:12.605
(laughs)

01:14.941 --> 01:15.975
You should be a comedian.

01:16.342 --> 01:17.377
I've thought about it.

01:23.383 --> 01:25.351
(door opening)

01:25.785 --> 01:28.354
Dad? Dad, Dad, what,
are you hiding?

01:32.959 --> 01:34.027
I heard the key in the door.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.361
I thought Lilith
might be with you.

01:37.297 --> 01:38.798
What's she coming for, anyway?

01:39.165 --> 01:40.200
Well, I don't really know.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.702
She... she said she was flying
across the country

01:42.702 --> 01:44.704
to ask me about something
that was important.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.172
She's being very mysterious
about it.

01:46.172 --> 01:47.173
Hmm.
(doorbell rings)

01:47.674 --> 01:48.675
Is that her?

01:48.675 --> 01:49.676
Well, no. No, Dad.

01:49.676 --> 01:51.177
I'm not seeing her
until tomorrow.

01:51.177 --> 01:52.679
Well, let me know
when she's coming, will you,

01:52.679 --> 01:54.180
so I can come up with an excuse
to clear out

01:54.180 --> 01:55.482
because I'm not good
at winging it.

01:56.716 --> 01:58.751
Oh... Lilith.

01:58.751 --> 02:00.019
.
(chuckles)
: Hi... uh..

02:00.220 --> 02:02.255
Look who's here, Dad.

02:02.689 --> 02:03.556
Hello, Martin.

02:05.391 --> 02:09.729
Oh! Time to go
practice my signature.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.030
.
Please, come on in, Lilith

02:11.531 --> 02:14.033
Uh, so, uh, I didn't think I was going to be seeing you

02:14.033 --> 02:15.535
until tomorrow

02:15.535 --> 02:18.037
Yes, I know that was the plan,
but I just had to stop by

02:18.037 --> 02:19.038
on my way to the hotel.

02:19.038 --> 02:21.040
What I'm here
to talk to you about

02:21.040 --> 02:23.443
is not something one just
drops on another person.

02:23.843 --> 02:25.912
Please.

02:27.380 --> 02:29.415
(sighs):
Frasier.

02:29.415 --> 02:30.416
(clears throat)

02:30.416 --> 02:31.417
Recently,

02:31.417 --> 02:32.919
a subconscious yearning

02:33.419 --> 02:35.922
has tunneled its way
to the surface

02:35.922 --> 02:38.424
and I now know
what it is I need

02:38.424 --> 02:41.194
in order to make my life complete.

02:41.394 --> 02:42.929
Well, that's wonderful news.

02:42.929 --> 02:44.264
How can I help?

02:44.597 --> 02:47.167
You can give me your sperm

02:54.607 --> 02:56.509
I beg your pardon?

02:56.509 --> 02:59.379
I want to have another baby.

02:59.746 --> 03:01.314
Well, you certainly
don't need me for that.

03:01.814 --> 03:06.719
Surely, someone in Boston
must have sperm.

03:06.719 --> 03:08.121
I came to you first

03:08.121 --> 03:10.056
so that Frederick could have a full sibling.

03:10.056 --> 03:11.491
So, just like that,

03:11.491 --> 03:13.493
we're going to have
another baby together?

03:13.493 --> 03:15.061
.
No, no, no, not just like that

03:15.061 --> 03:18.131
I mapped out our dominant and recessive traits

03:18.131 --> 03:20.633
on a genome square,
applied Mendel's laws,

03:20.633 --> 03:22.635
allowed for anomalies, and concluded

03:23.136 --> 03:25.405
that you are the best biological choice.

03:27.640 --> 03:28.641
I see.

03:28.641 --> 03:33.680
Well, as enticed as I am
by your honeyed words...

03:33.680 --> 03:36.616
I'm going to need some kissin'

03:38.551 --> 03:40.053
Frasier, don't misunderstand

03:40.053 --> 03:43.356
I'm not proposing
any change in our relationship.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.525
Would we sleep together?

03:45.792 --> 03:49.329
I thought we'd freeze
your sperm.

03:49.762 --> 03:52.832
Is that a yes or a no?

03:58.972 --> 04:01.040
Natural fertilization
isn't practical.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.476
I'd have to fly to Seattle every time I ovulate.

04:03.810 --> 04:06.879
Right, okay,
so then your plan is

04:06.879 --> 04:09.782
for me to visit
some local doctor,

04:10.116 --> 04:13.086
uh, freeze my essence
and then bring it home with you.

04:13.419 --> 04:13.987
Correct.

04:14.487 --> 04:16.856
I'll take mine to go.

04:18.224 --> 04:19.726
I...
I don't know.

04:20.026 --> 04:22.095
I'm going to have
to think about it.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.363
Yes, of course, absolutely.

04:23.363 --> 04:26.366
Think about it, and you can
give me your answer tomorrow.

04:26.366 --> 04:27.867
Ok

04:27.867 --> 04:31.738
You can come back from
around the corner now, Martin.

04:31.971 --> 04:33.806
MARTIN:
Good night, Lilith.

04:34.007 --> 04:35.475
Good night.

04:39.178 --> 04:40.947
You were eavesdropping?

04:41.147 --> 04:42.715
It was an accident,
and I only heard the part

04:42.715 --> 04:44.550
about her wanting to have
another baby with you.

04:44.550 --> 04:47.453
She completely threw me.

04:47.453 --> 04:49.455
Well, I don't know why you're so surprised.

04:49.455 --> 04:51.391
She's seen what
the Crane genes can do

04:51.724 --> 04:56.129
and she's coming back
to the well.

04:56.362 --> 04:59.399
How does one respond
to something like that?

04:59.832 --> 05:02.168
Well, I bet if you say no,
she'll go to Niles.

05:02.368 --> 05:03.403
Really, it's just
so self-centered of her.

05:03.903 --> 05:05.405
You know, she's got this
all figured out for herself

05:05.405 --> 05:07.340
without the slightest
consideration for my life.

05:07.340 --> 05:10.643
And Niles will
say no for sure.

05:10.643 --> 05:15.081
Which means only one thing:

05:15.081 --> 05:18.084
she'll come to the source.

05:18.084 --> 05:20.586
Me.

05:20.586 --> 05:23.556
The fountainhead.

05:23.923 --> 05:24.490
What?

05:24.991 --> 05:25.992
Can you imagine?

05:25.992 --> 05:28.061
Lilith's and my kid
would be brothers

05:28.561 --> 05:30.430
to you and Niles and Freddy.

05:30.430 --> 05:33.166
What are you talking about?

05:33.166 --> 05:35.601
And if you and Lilith
got back together,

05:35.601 --> 05:38.104
you'd be his stepfather
and his brother,

05:38.104 --> 05:42.942
and Niles would be your son...
and his own uncle.

05:45.745 --> 05:49.749
It's almost worth doing just so that I can tell the story.

05:54.620 --> 05:55.688
Oh, hi, Niles.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.190
Did Daphne and her mum
get off okay?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.459
Uh, yes, they picked up
Roz and Alice an hour ago.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.761
Although how they're going to get all the way to Canada

06:01.761 --> 06:03.129
without killing each other,
I don't know.

06:03.129 --> 06:04.597
Why did they have
to go so far?

06:05.098 --> 06:05.965
Well, that was my idea.

06:06.299 --> 06:07.367
I read that
Canadian Fun Country's

06:07.867 --> 06:08.868
one of the best amusement parks

06:08.868 --> 06:10.370
in southeastern
British Columbia.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.304
Oh.

06:11.304 --> 06:12.705
Well, I'm just saying

06:12.705 --> 06:14.207
Daphne's mum should be careful, you know.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.208
If you're here
on a temporary visa,

06:15.641 --> 06:16.676
sometimes people have
a difficult time

06:16.676 --> 06:18.010
getting back into the country.

06:18.244 --> 06:20.313
That hadn't occurred to me, Frasier.

06:20.313 --> 06:21.681
(clears throat)

06:21.981 --> 06:23.049
Well, seeing as howyou're single,

06:23.049 --> 06:24.550
I'd invite you
to join me for dinner,

06:24.550 --> 06:25.985
but I'm-I'm meeting
with Lilith tonight

06:25.985 --> 06:28.187
on a matter of some delicacy.

06:28.421 --> 06:29.489
Uh, Dad told me.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.991
Now listen,
don't feel obligated

06:31.991 --> 06:34.827
because she's buying you dinner.

06:34.827 --> 06:38.731
Truth be told, Niles,
I haven't ruled it out entirely.

06:38.998 --> 06:41.534
It would be nice
to have another child,

06:41.934 --> 06:45.004
and Lilith is
a wonderful mother.

06:45.004 --> 06:47.006
It's just that, well...

06:47.006 --> 06:49.509
is it right to create
a human being with a woman

06:50.009 --> 06:51.878
to whom you couldn't stand being married?

06:52.178 --> 06:54.747
Well, I'm behind you,
whatever decision you make--

06:54.747 --> 06:56.249
the right one or the crazy one.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.250
Well, thank you.

06:57.683 --> 06:58.684
(both chuckling)

06:58.684 --> 07:00.720
Excuse me.
May I have an
espresso, please?

07:00.720 --> 07:02.288
And what have you
got here?

07:02.288 --> 07:04.357
Oh, some snapshots
from last summer at the beach.

07:04.357 --> 07:05.691
Daphne finally got them
developed.

07:06.125 --> 07:07.193
(laughing):
Oh, look.

07:07.193 --> 07:10.196
There's Dad eating that hot dog
he dropped in the sand.

07:10.196 --> 07:11.631
Yes.

07:11.631 --> 07:14.700
And you in your
linen beach ensemble.

07:15.201 --> 07:16.068
Very nice, yes

07:16.369 --> 07:17.370
Well, that's strange.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.871
Daphne said
I'd particularly like

07:19.405 --> 07:21.441
the last picture on the roll,
but what is it?

07:21.841 --> 07:23.910
Well, it's hard to tell.

07:23.910 --> 07:25.912
It's too dark and blurry.

07:26.345 --> 07:28.047
Looks like the eye of Jupiter.

07:28.047 --> 07:29.582
Or a slice of pepperoni.

07:29.982 --> 07:31.818
Is it a flying saucer?

07:32.018 --> 07:33.886
Yes, Niles,
it's a flying saucer.

07:33.886 --> 07:35.788
Mystery solved.
Well done.

07:35.788 --> 07:36.789
Thanks

07:37.256 --> 07:39.292
Hey, where'd you get
the nipple shot?

07:42.795 --> 07:44.797
Good Lord!

07:46.365 --> 07:48.334
You are to erase that
from your mind!

07:48.634 --> 07:49.535
Well, is it Daphne?

07:49.836 --> 07:50.403
Nice.

07:50.903 --> 07:51.904
You're not erasing!

07:51.904 --> 07:52.905
Erase!

07:55.408 --> 07:57.910
I need to stop again.

07:57.910 --> 07:58.911
We just stopped.

07:58.911 --> 08:00.813
I told you not to get that Big Gulp.

08:03.249 --> 08:04.817
Punchb

08:04.817 --> 08:06.185
Ow! Dammit!

08:06.486 --> 08:06.986
Language.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.821
Why does she keep doing that?

08:09.188 --> 08:10.089
It's a game.

08:10.356 --> 08:11.691
It hurts.

08:11.891 --> 08:13.226
All right, Mum.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.794
There's a gas station
right there.

08:14.794 --> 08:15.795
I really need to stop.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.630
I can't get over.
You'll have to wait.

08:17.897 --> 08:19.465
But according to this,

08:19.465 --> 08:22.735
my bladder is holding
"thirsty"-two ounces of soda.

08:22.935 --> 08:24.403
It's only 40 miles.

08:24.737 --> 08:26.072
Punchbuggy red.

08:26.272 --> 08:27.240
Oh, son of a...!

08:27.607 --> 08:28.608
Language.

08:28.608 --> 08:29.675
Alice, honey,

08:29.675 --> 08:31.978
stop hitting Mrs. Moon.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.080
She can't take
the punchbuggy game.

08:34.380 --> 08:36.948
Oh, really?

08:36.948 --> 08:37.783
Punchbuggy white.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.585
Ow! That was a Jeep.

08:39.585 --> 08:41.587
I like playing with Jeeps.

08:41.587 --> 08:42.587
And Fords.

08:43.089 --> 08:43.856
Punchbuggy Ford.

08:45.124 --> 08:46.659
All right, that's enough!

08:47.059 --> 08:50.563
You stop it, or no one's going to Canadian Fun Country.

08:50.963 --> 08:53.032
And this time I mean it.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.000
(screams)

08:54.000 --> 08:55.468
(others scream)

08:55.468 --> 08:59.438
I'm sorry. I thought you were
on the wrong side of the road.

08:59.438 --> 09:01.440
I will never get used
to the crazy way

09:01.941 --> 09:02.909
you drive over here.

09:02.909 --> 09:05.344
Mum, you have to stop
doing that.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.313
Daphne, you seem stressed.

09:07.813 --> 09:10.583
Do you want me to drive
for a while?

09:10.783 --> 09:12.852
Maybe once we get out
of Seattle.

09:16.822 --> 09:19.325
Frasier, I don't want to rush you,

09:19.825 --> 09:22.261
but the suspense
is too much to bear.

09:22.628 --> 09:24.130
Have you decided?

09:24.497 --> 09:27.833
I'm thinking
about the linguini.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.369
I see.

09:30.369 --> 09:32.238
It's "no" then, isn't it?

09:33.573 --> 09:35.441
I'm sorry, Lilith.

09:35.741 --> 09:38.110
This was a very difficult
decision for me,

09:38.311 --> 09:40.880
and I am touched and flattered
that you came to me,

09:41.380 --> 09:44.383
but I'm not sure I'd be doing it for the right reasons.

09:44.383 --> 09:45.685
You understand, don't you?

09:45.685 --> 09:46.986
Yes, I do.

09:46.986 --> 09:49.322
And I appreciate your taking
the time to think about it.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.623
Well...

09:50.623 --> 09:52.592
It's that kind of consideration

09:52.592 --> 09:54.560
I was hoping to pass on
to our second-born.

09:56.996 --> 09:58.931
Oh, well.

09:59.298 --> 10:01.367
So, the pasta's good here?

10:01.367 --> 10:02.368
Oh, the best.

10:04.337 --> 10:07.807
♪♪
(tune of "Ode To Joy"):
♪♪ My dad is the gweatest dad

10:07.807 --> 10:09.709
♪♪
♪♪ Because he cooks
me cweam of wheat...

10:09.709 --> 10:11.110
Lilith, what are you singing?

10:11.110 --> 10:12.945
Was I singing?

10:13.312 --> 10:16.215
You were singing
"My Dad is the Gweatest Dad."

10:16.215 --> 10:17.783
Oh, you mean that song
Frederick wrote for you

10:17.783 --> 10:18.784
when he was four?

10:19.218 --> 10:21.787
That video is one of
my prize possessions.

10:21.787 --> 10:24.590
Of course I haven't
looked at it in some time.

10:24.590 --> 10:27.393
I remember the night
we surprised you with it.

10:27.393 --> 10:29.895
He crawled up in
your lap and said,

10:29.895 --> 10:31.330
"Why is Daddy cwying?"

10:31.330 --> 10:33.766
I see what you're doing,
you know.

10:33.766 --> 10:34.767
What?

10:34.767 --> 10:35.768
You are attempting
to manipulate me

10:36.268 --> 10:37.670
by invoking powerful,
emotional memories.

10:38.004 --> 10:41.340
I assure you, nothing could be
further from the truth.

10:41.574 --> 10:42.642
Are you ready to order?

10:42.642 --> 10:43.509
Yes.

10:43.843 --> 10:45.745
I'd like the bisketti
with beatmalls.

10:46.078 --> 10:47.546
Mmm, very
good, miss

10:47.913 --> 10:49.982
That's what our son used to say when he was three.

10:50.416 --> 10:52.284
Excellent!

10:52.284 --> 10:54.353
And I'll have the veal.

10:54.553 --> 10:57.123
Bravo, sir.

10:57.123 --> 10:58.591
Lilith,

10:59.025 --> 11:01.594
.
I'm afraid
you're idealizing parenthood

11:01.594 --> 11:05.498
Do you remember colic? Teething?
Changing mountains of diapers?

11:05.865 --> 11:07.433
Do you remember that
time in the bath

11:07.433 --> 11:08.834
when he tried to
eat the bubbles?

11:09.201 --> 11:10.603
We told him to stop,

11:10.870 --> 11:11.937
but we kept laughing,

11:11.937 --> 11:14.740
so he thought it was
funny and kept doing it.

11:14.940 --> 11:16.509
You know, I'd forgotten
about that.

11:16.509 --> 11:18.010
Oh, I wish we had that on video.

11:18.444 --> 11:19.512
You can, Frasier.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.513
We can have those days back again.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.481
Please

11:22.915 --> 11:25.484
I just need a couple
of teaspoons.

11:25.918 --> 11:27.253
Lilith!

11:27.453 --> 11:29.021
Just think about what Frederick has meant

11:29.021 --> 11:29.955
in our lives.

11:30.289 --> 11:31.357
I think about it every day.

11:31.357 --> 11:32.792
Frasier...

11:32.792 --> 11:35.861
we're always seeking ways we can leave a legacy.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.864
Well, forget my research
and your work.

11:38.864 --> 11:40.299
This is it.

11:40.633 --> 11:43.002
What better gift can
we bestow on the world

11:43.302 --> 11:46.706
but another person as
wonderful as Frederick?

11:49.041 --> 11:49.842
Excuse me,

11:49.842 --> 11:52.978
um... I've changed my mind.

11:52.978 --> 11:54.780
,
I've decided that I, too

11:54.780 --> 11:56.716
will have
the bisketti and beatmalls.

12:03.656 --> 12:05.658
Thank you.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.159
Gosh, that coffee smells so good

12:07.159 --> 12:08.394
Mmm.

12:08.661 --> 12:09.729
Lilith won't let me have
any caffeine

12:09.729 --> 12:11.163
until I've made
my little donation.

12:11.530 --> 12:13.399
Ah, yes.

12:13.666 --> 12:14.667
So, have you heard from Daphne?

12:14.667 --> 12:17.503
No, we keep
missing each other.

12:17.870 --> 12:20.940
I'm just glad I have
our little pictorial memento

12:21.440 --> 12:22.408
to keep me company.

12:22.408 --> 12:23.876
I can't believe you're so taken

12:23.876 --> 12:25.344
with that blurry
overexposed photo of a...

12:25.711 --> 12:27.079
Shh.

12:27.346 --> 12:32.384
Of what you first mistook
to be a flying saucer.

12:32.752 --> 12:35.721
I just think it's sexy
that she even did it.

12:36.088 --> 12:36.655
Yeah.

12:37.156 --> 12:38.157
Imagine it-- she saw

12:38.157 --> 12:39.458
there was one picture
left on the roll.

12:39.692 --> 12:43.262
In a spontaneous moment
of brazen exhibitionism,

12:43.262 --> 12:44.263
she threw open her blouse

12:44.764 --> 12:46.766
and just didn't even bother
to adjust the f-stop.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.267
(chuckles)

12:48.267 --> 12:51.137
Yes, indeed. Oh.

12:51.403 --> 12:55.841
I am married
to one spicy meatball.

12:55.841 --> 12:57.176
Good Lord.

12:57.176 --> 12:59.578
Don't tell me you carry
it around with you.

13:00.012 --> 13:01.080
Well...

13:01.080 --> 13:03.082
I didn't want
the housekeeper to find it

13:03.082 --> 13:05.384
and think we were
pornographers.

13:11.157 --> 13:13.159
WOMAN:
Just fill out these forms

13:13.159 --> 13:15.127
and I can show you to
one of our donation suites

13:15.127 --> 13:16.128
Thank you.

13:24.470 --> 13:25.871
Will this be your first?

13:26.238 --> 13:28.307
No, I've been doing this
since I was 12.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.984
You mean baby.

13:38.984 --> 13:41.420
Uh, no, no.
This is our second

13:41.821 --> 13:43.689
We've got number four
on the way.

13:43.889 --> 13:44.957
Oh, and we're
thrilled for you,

13:44.957 --> 13:46.959
but perhaps we can chat
some other time

13:46.959 --> 13:48.961
when we're not trying
to create life.

13:48.961 --> 13:50.796
Sign and date.
Right.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.168
This process can be hard
on a relationship,

13:56.602 --> 13:58.637
but she'll relax
and things will get better.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.573
We're already divorced.

14:01.006 --> 14:02.575
Good, 'cause she'll
never change.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.678
Up and at 'em.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.012
Follow me, sir.

14:10.850 --> 14:12.852
Just go ahead in and make
yourself comfortable.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.353
You'll find everything
you need in the cabinet.

14:14.854 --> 14:15.621
Thank you.

14:16.922 --> 14:18.691
Uh, wait, Frasier.

14:19.024 --> 14:20.559
It probably doesn't matter, but...

14:21.093 --> 14:23.495
try to think
positive thoughts.

14:23.829 --> 14:25.898
Thanks for that.

14:25.898 --> 14:27.399
I was going to think

14:27.399 --> 14:30.369
about the plight
of the American Indian.

14:33.172 --> 14:35.674
I'm just saying we should put the welfare of the sample first.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.076
Mm-hmm.

14:42.147 --> 14:43.215
Yes?

14:43.716 --> 14:45.718
And don't fall asleep
afterwards.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.721
I want to get
these puppies on ice ASAP.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.224
Good-bye now.

14:57.296 --> 14:58.797
Just a hint.

14:58.797 --> 14:59.798
Lilith!

15:00.299 --> 15:03.802
If there is one thing I can
do by myself,this is it.

15:03.802 --> 15:06.305
Now, go away.

15:10.743 --> 15:12.311
Right this way.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.751
(phone ringing)

15:19.018 --> 15:21.086
What?!

15:23.088 --> 15:24.590
I just remembered
a special method

15:24.590 --> 15:26.992
which supposedly
increases the likelihood

15:27.359 --> 15:28.827
of having a boy.
I see.

15:29.194 --> 15:30.763
Is there something I can do
to increase the likelihood

15:30.763 --> 15:34.133
that we won't have
a nettling control freak?

15:34.433 --> 15:36.001
No, but perhaps you can use a method

15:36.001 --> 15:38.504
which will give us a baby that
can take other people's advice.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.005
I would settle for a method

15:40.005 --> 15:41.507
where it won't turn out
to be a sarcastic prig!

15:42.007 --> 15:42.508
Oh, just do it

15:42.942 --> 15:43.442
Fine.

15:44.009 --> 15:45.010
No, wait.

15:45.010 --> 15:46.278
I don't want you to do it when you're mad

15:46.512 --> 15:47.579
Why don't we just.

15:47.579 --> 15:49.448
take a minute and
sit down and breathe?

15:52.284 --> 15:53.786
It's your dime.

15:55.000 --> 16:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:06.799 --> 16:08.667
Oh, dear God.

16:08.968 --> 16:11.537
What if this child inherits
all of our flaws

16:11.537 --> 16:13.038
instead of our strengths?

16:13.038 --> 16:14.940
We could create
a real nightmare.

16:15.274 --> 16:16.842
That's not going to happen.

16:16.842 --> 16:18.844
It's going to
be exactly the way

16:18.844 --> 16:20.479
it was the first time.

16:20.479 --> 16:23.048
Is that what's going on

16:23.048 --> 16:25.551
Are we trying to create a baby

16:25.551 --> 16:28.554
or just trying
to recreate the past?

16:28.554 --> 16:31.557
I mean, Frederick's
almost grown now.

16:31.557 --> 16:34.360
It's only natural
to feel a sense of loss.

16:34.360 --> 16:36.195
Frasier, don't be simplistic.

16:36.695 --> 16:38.697
Well, Lilith, I-I know
what you're going through.

16:38.697 --> 16:40.699
You want to feel needed
and loved

16:40.699 --> 16:43.102
as you were when you
were a new mother.

16:43.435 --> 16:45.504
The past can be very seductive.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.006
I mean,
I've fallen into it, too

16:47.506 --> 16:49.508
I'm trying to relive
Freddy's childhood, but.

16:51.510 --> 16:56.515
You can't use the past to fill what's missing in the present.

16:56.515 --> 16:58.350
It's gone.

17:00.219 --> 17:03.222
Frasier, I've
done a lot of thinking

17:03.222 --> 17:05.190
and this feels right to me

17:07.693 --> 17:10.194
But it's not right for me.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.530
I'm sorry.

17:14.366 --> 17:16.367
I'm sorry, too.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.046
You all right?

17:27.046 --> 17:28.480
fine.
I'll be

17:28.847 --> 17:30.916
If I can't make another
little Frederick with you,

17:30.916 --> 17:32.384
there's always cloning.

17:32.818 --> 17:34.887
And you still don't know when I'm joking.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.388
I... Well, I...

17:36.855 --> 17:39.892
Lilith, what are you
going to do now?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.393
Well, I'm going to go home

17:41.393 --> 17:42.795
and give Frederick a very big hug.

17:43.162 --> 17:45.731
And maybe swab the
inside of his cheek.

17:46.131 --> 17:47.199
Oh, stop that.

17:51.703 --> 17:53.205
Oh, you already ate.

17:53.205 --> 17:55.674
I was going
to take you to Bogart's.

17:56.075 --> 17:56.642
Bogart's?

17:57.109 --> 17:59.078
Oh, don't worry about that

17:59.078 --> 18:01.113
I was just eating it
because it was here.

18:01.113 --> 18:02.581
I wasn't eating it to get full

18:02.581 --> 18:03.582
Just give me two minutes.

18:04.049 --> 18:05.584
(phone ringing)

18:07.586 --> 18:08.620
Hello.

18:08.620 --> 18:10.622
Oh, Niles, darling.

18:10.622 --> 18:11.623
Daphne!

18:11.623 --> 18:13.125
I thought I'd never reach you.

18:13.559 --> 18:16.628
We were booted from the park and are coming home.

18:16.628 --> 18:19.965
It seems someone put out
 a cigarette on a stuffed moose.

18:20.265 --> 18:22.267
I didn't know it was stuffed

18:22.768 --> 18:24.603
I was defending myself.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.905
I love those pictures
you left for me.

18:27.339 --> 18:30.409
More specifically, the last one.

18:30.409 --> 18:32.411
Something
a little different, eh?

18:32.411 --> 18:33.412
Indeed, it is.

18:33.412 --> 18:35.848
I can't even believe
you took it.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.249
I didn't take it.

18:37.249 --> 18:38.183
Your father did.

18:38.183 --> 18:41.086
No, I don't think so.

18:41.086 --> 18:44.089
I'm talking about
the last picture on the roll.

18:44.089 --> 18:45.090
The close-up.

18:45.591 --> 18:46.525
Yeah.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.427
Your father was trying
to get a picture of Eddy,

18:48.927 --> 18:51.430
but instead he got
a picture of his own chest.

18:51.430 --> 18:53.699
This is Dad's...

18:53.899 --> 18:54.967
That's his nipple.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.369
(shudders)

18:57.703 --> 18:58.637
Can't wait to get to Bogart's.

18:58.971 --> 19:01.039
I know just what
I'm going to get--

19:01.540 --> 19:02.908
the barbecued
chicken breast

19:06.278 --> 19:08.847
They have
the juiciest one in town.

19:08.847 --> 19:10.349
Or the lamb.

19:10.349 --> 19:12.251
They serve an enormous rack.

19:12.584 --> 19:15.120
That's great.

19:15.487 --> 19:16.922
You might want to get
an overcoat of Frasier's

19:16.922 --> 19:17.789
out of there.

19:18.290 --> 19:19.791
It's supposed to be
pretty nippy tonight.

19:23.962 --> 19:25.964
Oh, hi, Dad.
Where you going?
Hi

19:25.964 --> 19:26.965
Oh, Niles is here.

19:26.965 --> 19:27.966
We're just going out for a bite.

19:27.966 --> 19:28.967
Do you want to join us?

19:28.967 --> 19:30.269
Sure.

19:30.502 --> 19:32.070
So, uh...

19:32.070 --> 19:34.006
how's Lilith?

19:34.006 --> 19:36.909
I just dropped her off
at the airport.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.410
She's disappointed,
but she knows

19:38.410 --> 19:40.212
that we're doing
the right thing.

19:40.445 --> 19:42.781
Well, for what it's worth, I think you are, too, son.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.583
Oh, thanks, Dad.

19:44.583 --> 19:48.587
.
Just hope she finds
what's missing in her life

19:51.056 --> 19:52.925
Hey, Pasty

19:55.227 --> 19:56.728
Oh, hello.

19:56.728 --> 19:57.729
May I?

19:57.729 --> 19:59.731
Yes, certainly.

20:01.200 --> 20:02.234
What happened?

20:02.234 --> 20:04.236
I thought you were
relocating to Seattle.

20:04.236 --> 20:05.737
Uh, it wasn't a fit.

20:05.737 --> 20:07.706
I'm going back to Boston.

20:08.106 --> 20:09.675
I don't know,
call me neurotic.

20:09.675 --> 20:12.644
I just can't work in a lab that's not immaculate.

20:15.113 --> 20:16.481
You work in a lab?

20:16.815 --> 20:18.383
Mmm, I'm a physicist.

20:18.817 --> 20:20.819
Really?

20:21.186 --> 20:23.755
My name's Lilith.

20:23.755 --> 20:25.190
Ah, the demon goddess.

20:25.190 --> 20:27.559
Are you like the, uh..

20:27.960 --> 20:30.829
independent fireball
that was your predecessor?

20:30.829 --> 20:34.466
I make her look
like a vacillating cream puff.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.768
Albert

20:36.768 --> 20:39.238
What happened
with your friend?

20:39.238 --> 20:40.739
Did you get your favor?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.574
It's a long story.

20:42.574 --> 20:44.910
Well, it's, uh...

20:44.910 --> 20:47.412
it's a long flight.
