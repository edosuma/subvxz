00:03.471 --> 00:06.274
Doctor, please. What can you
tell me about my son?

00:06.307 --> 00:08.709
I'll tell you, but it's
gonna cost you a kiss.

00:08.742 --> 00:11.112
Doctor, I am married.
I'll have you reported.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.347
I guess you don't
wanna hear about your son.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.582
Fine.

00:16.484 --> 00:18.686
Okay. What can you
tell me about my son?

00:18.719 --> 00:21.122
First of all,
he doesn't kiss like his mom.

00:21.155 --> 00:23.057
She's flat-lining, Dr. Stryker!

00:23.091 --> 00:25.059
Not on my watch.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.030
Treat my kid or we
all die together!

00:30.864 --> 00:32.333
Stryker!

00:34.268 --> 00:36.604
No one's gonna die on my watch!

00:36.637 --> 00:40.274
And God bless my doctors and let
your angels watch over them.

00:41.575 --> 00:43.611
We don't need angels, Michael.

00:43.644 --> 00:45.246
We're doctors.

00:45.279 --> 00:47.047
We can fix ourselves.

00:48.616 --> 00:50.384
(Blake)
'I'm really in shock.'

00:50.418 --> 00:54.488
It really makes you question
the big picture, you know?

00:54.522 --> 00:56.657
I'm not sure I wanna help
kids anymore..

00:56.690 --> 00:59.293
...if I'm just gonna end up
dying some day.

00:59.327 --> 01:01.329
He seemed completely fine.

01:01.362 --> 01:04.565
He was talking about
going on a vacation.

01:04.598 --> 01:07.268
To heaven, now that
I think about it.

01:07.301 --> 01:08.502
He was my best friend.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.138
He was my best friend.

01:10.171 --> 01:12.773
He was the next man
I was going to sleep with.

01:12.806 --> 01:14.542
No, he was my best friend.

01:14.575 --> 01:16.577
- My best friend.
- He was my best friend.

01:16.610 --> 01:18.812
- Definitely my best friend.
- He was my best friend.

01:18.846 --> 01:21.582
I've been crying so much,
my panties are wet.

01:21.615 --> 01:24.518
[playing flute]

01:27.688 --> 01:31.525
Losing a colleague and a friend
like Dr. Brock Stryker

01:31.559 --> 01:33.461
will be difficult for all of us.

01:33.494 --> 01:37.231
That's why I am providing my
services as a grief counselor.

01:37.265 --> 01:39.233
Since when are you
a grief counselor?

01:39.267 --> 01:40.668
That was my minor at Westlake.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.536
- Go Wildcats!
- Now, none of you

01:42.570 --> 01:44.905
will deal with a patient
until I determine

01:44.938 --> 01:46.340
that you are emotionally ready.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.775
'Everybody!'

01:47.808 --> 01:50.211
Two clown cars have collided
on their free way.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.479
And they're coming here.

01:58.186 --> 02:00.921
Eh, circus clowns, the worst.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.556
They just keep
coming and coming.

02:02.590 --> 02:04.658
Or they should have
gotten a clown ambulance.

02:04.692 --> 02:07.161
It's twice as small,
but it holds more clowns.

02:07.195 --> 02:09.630
Why are all you doctors
just standing around?

02:09.663 --> 02:11.432
Oh, sorry, Dori.
We can't help.

02:11.465 --> 02:13.267
Sy's orders, you know,
because we're eating.

02:13.301 --> 02:15.203
- You mean grieving.
- Whatever.

02:15.236 --> 02:18.272
I guess I'll just go and grieve
this box of doughnuts until

02:18.306 --> 02:20.174
there's no more left to grieve.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.510
- You, these are your people.
- These aren't my people.

02:22.543 --> 02:25.613
These are circus clowns.
I'm a city clown, clearly

02:25.646 --> 02:27.581
I mean, look at their faces.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.350
Now look at mine.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.285
Now look back at them.

02:31.319 --> 02:32.853
Now look at my face.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.389
Now look back there,
and now what's back here?

02:35.423 --> 02:36.490
Totally different.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.326
Excuse me, I needed to..

02:40.461 --> 02:42.730
I thought this was
a reputable hospital.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.833
Shouldn't you be at a county
fair somewhere, circus clown?

02:45.866 --> 02:48.802
Shouldn't you be shopping at
J. Crew and drinking soda

02:48.836 --> 02:50.971
with the tan faces,
city clown?

02:51.004 --> 02:54.342
I bet you don't even know
how to do lifesaving surgery

02:54.375 --> 02:56.810
which I do and
will not do for you.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.846
He can't do surgery anyway
because he's eating.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.748
Grieving.

03:00.781 --> 03:02.983
(Woman on PA)
'Attention, Cheryl Ladd.
Please marry me.'

03:03.016 --> 03:04.452
How's the new
hearing aid?

03:04.485 --> 03:07.888
I hear you loud
and clear, America.

03:07.921 --> 03:11.292
Um...so sad about
Brock, isn't it?

03:11.325 --> 03:13.594
- Sad. I'll tell you what's sad.
- Yeah.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.496
Working hard, starting
your own small business

03:15.529 --> 03:18.566
and then the government comes
along, taxes the hell out of it

03:18.599 --> 03:21.001
and gives it to people just
sitting on their butts.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.637
I've said it a million times,
Keep your paws off

03:23.671 --> 03:25.339
my paycheck, Uncle Sam!

03:25.373 --> 03:27.808
I'm pretty sure you've
said that no times.

03:27.841 --> 03:31.445
Sure, I'm sad, but...
I just don't think Brock would

03:31.479 --> 03:33.814
want us wasting our time
mourning him, you know?

03:33.847 --> 03:36.484
I think he'd want us out
there fixing people.

03:36.517 --> 03:37.918
I mean, it's what he'd do.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.887
I'll tell you something, Blake.

03:39.920 --> 03:43.557
Your ability to deal with
death is just unbelievable.

03:43.591 --> 03:48.296
I'm making a note here that says
you are cleared for surgery.

03:48.329 --> 03:50.464
- Great. Thanks.
- Come back soon.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.700
You and Brock never went
to Joshua Tree together.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.735
Well, you guys never
got spray tans together.

03:54.768 --> 03:56.970
Boys, you were both very,
very important to Brock--

03:57.004 --> 03:58.772
You call yourself a therapist?

03:58.806 --> 04:01.409
You don't even know the cool
therapy stuff like hypnosis

04:01.442 --> 04:02.976
or past-life regression.

04:03.010 --> 04:05.913
Past-life regression is not
even scientifically valid.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.448
Let's do it.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.683
Oh, hey. I'm here.
Scoot over!

04:09.717 --> 04:12.920
Why don't you both tell me how
you're feeling toward Brock?

04:12.953 --> 04:15.323
Aah! Aah! Aah!
I'm in the past life.

04:15.356 --> 04:16.824
I'm-I'm not hypnotizing you.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.358
I'm John Lennon.

04:18.392 --> 04:20.027
Ringo, Paul, George,
is that you?

04:20.060 --> 04:21.661
No, it's me,
Mark David Chapman.

04:21.695 --> 04:23.331
I'm a big fan.
Pow! Pow!

04:23.364 --> 04:25.966
Come on. Will you just
speak up and tell me

04:25.999 --> 04:28.001
how you're feeling about Brock?

04:28.035 --> 04:30.838
I'm in another past life.
I'm Abraham Lincoln.

04:30.871 --> 04:32.973
Oh, Mr. Lincoln,
it's John Wilkes Booth here.

04:33.006 --> 04:35.709
I'm your biggest fan.
Pow! Pow!

04:35.743 --> 04:37.745
Will you stop
assassinating each other?

04:37.778 --> 04:39.980
I'm Anne Frank.
Have you seen my diary?

04:40.013 --> 04:42.015
I'm a Nazi soldier!
I've seen it!

04:42.049 --> 04:43.651
I'm a big fan. Pow! Pow!

04:43.684 --> 04:45.319
- You missed me.
- Pow!

04:45.353 --> 04:47.955
And that is why I am
all about the death penalty.

04:47.988 --> 04:51.625
In just a minute, we'll meet a
man who has taken up arms to

04:51.659 --> 04:53.060
defend our border with Mexico.

04:53.093 --> 04:56.096
We call him the Taco Tackler.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.931
And I say bravo to you, sir.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.433
I'm worried about you, Chief.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.669
I feel like you're not
dealing with your grief.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.971
Totally disagree. Mitch from
Miami, what do you think?

05:04.004 --> 05:06.674
- I'm from Tampa--
- I got to cut you off, Mitch.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.542
Boy, howdy, am I
tired of these

05:08.576 --> 05:10.611
namby-pamby
bleeding-heart liberals.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.980
Blake, you're the only doctor
cleared to work.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.615
You have to help these clowns.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.450
I'll never help
a circus clown, Brian.

05:16.484 --> 05:19.086
[whistles]

05:26.694 --> 05:28.996
[whistling continues]

05:36.570 --> 05:38.071
How do you know that song?

05:38.105 --> 05:40.474
It's an old circus
clown spiritual.

05:40.508 --> 05:41.809
How do you know it?

05:41.842 --> 05:44.445
My gaga told me it was
a city clown ditty

05:44.478 --> 05:48.115
and if I was ever lost
to just whistle it..

05:48.148 --> 05:50.384
- And a friend would appear.
- Yeah.

05:50.418 --> 05:52.720
Maybe you two aren't
that different after all.

05:54.488 --> 05:55.723
Aah! Clowns!

05:59.660 --> 06:01.429
Looks like you're right, Brian.

06:01.462 --> 06:04.131
We spend so much time fighting
over our differences when

06:04.164 --> 06:06.934
in the eyes of a child,
we're all...all the same.

06:08.669 --> 06:10.638
Bring that kid back in here!

06:12.072 --> 06:13.607
Look at him.

06:13.641 --> 06:15.409
- Thrilled to see us, huh?
- Right, kid?

06:16.744 --> 06:18.612
Hey, I know.

06:18.646 --> 06:21.682
Why don't I treat you to one
of my famous characters, huh?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.851
Hungry Bear.

06:23.884 --> 06:24.985
Gaah!

06:30.991 --> 06:34.595
Oh! He's peed himself
with happiness.

06:34.628 --> 06:36.430
Get him out of here.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.068
Maybe we should stop
our bickering, huh?

06:41.101 --> 06:43.036
Learn to help each other.

06:44.872 --> 06:45.873
Aah!

06:47.207 --> 06:49.443
No, I know what it was.

06:49.477 --> 06:52.446
[both laugh]

06:52.480 --> 06:56.750
I always felt those feelings
were connected to my mother.

06:56.784 --> 06:59.820
She just never made me feel
like my father loved me enough.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.656
'Someone's got to make money
for the family. How about Cat?'

07:02.690 --> 07:05.125
You know, She developed early.
She's talented.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.861
We didn't have cheerleading
in Senegal where I grew up.

07:07.895 --> 07:09.497
You know what our hobbies were?

07:09.530 --> 07:11.164
Malaria... and blood diamonds.

07:11.198 --> 07:14.001
I guess I just don't know
whether my one-woman show should

07:14.034 --> 07:16.637
be mainly character-based or,
like, songs or, like, stories.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.872
You know, have you seen
my Puerto Rican girl?

07:18.906 --> 07:19.907
It's really good.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.909
"Mira, Mira, listen to me."

07:21.942 --> 07:24.745
"Okay, I don't like..I don't
like American boys, you know?

07:24.778 --> 07:27.114
Daddy, can you see these tears?

07:27.147 --> 07:31.151
Because I cried them
all by myself.

07:35.656 --> 07:36.924
Thank you, doctor.

07:36.957 --> 07:39.226
- I'm cured.
- No, you're not.

07:39.259 --> 07:42.896
(Sal on PA system)
'Attention, hospital staff.
Is this thing on?'

07:42.930 --> 07:45.666
'Oh, wait.
Of course it is. Duh.'

07:52.272 --> 07:54.174
Uh, Lola, that's my lunch.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.876
[roars]

08:02.149 --> 08:05.753
That is no way to deal
with your grief, Lola.

08:05.786 --> 08:08.155
I think it's time
someone intervene..

08:11.792 --> 08:13.794
...by way of an intervention.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.529
Lola, welcome.

08:15.563 --> 08:16.964
You know,
all of your friends

08:16.997 --> 08:19.867
are really worried about
your binge eating.

08:19.900 --> 08:23.270
Every one of them has written
you a personal letter.

08:23.303 --> 08:25.238
- Blake, lead us off.
- Okay.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.611
"Lola, I'm so worried
about you.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.078
"I lie awake at night

08:32.111 --> 08:33.914
wondering if you're gonna
choke on things."

08:33.947 --> 08:36.984
"I even like my girls
thick, but damn

08:37.017 --> 08:39.553
the way you look now,
it's just nasty."

08:39.587 --> 08:41.589
"I hid where the Nazis
couldn't find me

08:41.621 --> 08:43.724
but I can hear them
outside my window."

08:43.756 --> 08:46.594
"If you eat less than your
allotted points for the day

08:46.627 --> 08:49.730
you can carry them over
into your bank of flex points."

08:49.763 --> 08:51.031
"Mira, Mira, look at me.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.100
I do not like those
American boys."

08:53.133 --> 08:55.736
You guys mean so much to me.

08:55.769 --> 08:59.773
Yeah, I was...I was
just sad about Brock.

08:59.807 --> 09:02.309
But I don't... I don't need
this junk anymore.

09:02.342 --> 09:05.045
I don't.
I just need a hug.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.982
Aww.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.283
Thanks.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.789
We got you.
We got you.

09:15.823 --> 09:18.191
I got an announcement
for these liberal cry-babies

09:18.225 --> 09:20.027
that want to take away my guns.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.963
You can pry them from
my cold dead hands!

09:22.996 --> 09:24.598
We'll be back in a minute.

09:24.632 --> 09:25.833
You're watching an Encore
presentation

09:25.866 --> 09:27.334
of Hoss O'Brien Live.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.136
Chief, what's gotten into you?

09:29.169 --> 09:33.206
Every night, I have strange
sensations in my legs.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.008
Wiggling and jumping.

09:35.042 --> 09:38.746
I had restless-leg syndrome.
R.L.S. can happen to anyone..

09:41.248 --> 09:44.084
Wait a minute.
The voices have stopped.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.053
I think the TV somehow
was interfering

09:46.086 --> 09:49.322
with your new
hearing aid. So weird.

09:49.356 --> 09:52.660
Well, that kind of stuff happens
all the time in real life.

09:52.693 --> 09:54.027
I guess you're right.

09:54.061 --> 09:56.930
- Hey, let's go smoke some weed.
- Okay.

09:59.667 --> 10:00.734
Damn!

10:01.902 --> 10:04.738
- Can I help you?
- Yes!

10:04.772 --> 10:08.909
Just here to drop off this box
of 1000 new hearing aids.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.112
[laughs evilly]

10:16.216 --> 10:18.318
Is that all?

10:18.351 --> 10:21.121
Uh...know what?

10:21.154 --> 10:23.724
Um, give me a Coke too.

10:23.757 --> 10:25.092
'We don't have Coke. Sorry.'

10:25.125 --> 10:26.760
