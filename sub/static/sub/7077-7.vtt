WEBVTT

00:01.084 --> 00:02.586
His name is Archie DeCoste.

00:02.878 --> 00:05.881
Age: 22.
Total years spent in high school: Seven.

00:06.173 --> 00:07.966
SAT score: Zero.

00:08.258 --> 00:12.346
And he was recently arrested for
selling marijuana to a police officer...

00:12.638 --> 00:13.764
at a police station.

00:14.056 --> 00:16.308
So you want us to help
you recruit this idiot...

00:16.600 --> 00:19.019
instead of an honours student
or a science genius?

00:19.311 --> 00:21.021
Do we go to the same Greendale?

00:21.313 --> 00:24.399
But let me reveal the fortune
inside this cookie.

00:24.691 --> 00:27.319
Family net worth: $8 million.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.279
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:29.571 --> 00:33.200
this is what we in the community
college recruiting game call a whale.

00:33.492 --> 00:37.496
The perfect mix of low intellect,
high lack of ambition...

00:37.788 --> 00:39.289
and limitless parental support.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.750
So a rich dumb-dumb
who will never graduate...

00:42.042 --> 00:44.670
and keep dropping money into
the school. Got it.

00:44.962 --> 00:46.296
Is there much money in this...

00:46.588 --> 00:49.841
or is it like that endorsement deal
you made with Let's Potato Chips?

00:50.133 --> 00:52.594
If you don't like the crispy-licious
taste of Let's...

00:52.886 --> 00:55.222
feel free to eat
that other greasy brand.

00:55.514 --> 00:58.350
- Splingles? Not this guy.
- Thank you, Troy.

00:58.642 --> 01:01.937
And I will explain the value
of this whale...

01:02.229 --> 01:05.315
by describing one who's been
swimming right under your nose.

01:05.607 --> 01:10.862
Pierce Hawthorne has taken 80 percent
of Greendale's classes more than twice.

01:11.154 --> 01:14.741
He is the only Greendale student who
has ever paid for a premium locker...

01:15.033 --> 01:17.077
or the extended pencil warranty.

01:17.703 --> 01:19.538
Pierce cannot know about this,
okay?

01:19.830 --> 01:23.584
He's a big baby who throws tantrums
when anyone else gets attention.

01:23.875 --> 01:26.169
Remember when Kerri Strug
visited our campus?

01:26.461 --> 01:27.461
That was horrible.

01:27.671 --> 01:32.259
I have scheduled Archie's visit for
tomorrow when Pierce has no classes.

01:32.551 --> 01:36.096
Guys, I'm asking,
as treasurer of the Forensics Club.

01:36.388 --> 01:39.099
The dean said we could use
whale money for a new body farm.

01:39.391 --> 01:41.643
- Who wants to help?
- I'm in. Sounds like a romper.

01:41.935 --> 01:44.813
We do need money. The Biology
Department has been dissecting...

01:45.105 --> 01:46.773
the same dead pig for 10 years.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.526
If we land this kid,
we can buy a hundred dead pigs...

01:49.818 --> 01:51.028
and make everybody happy.

01:51.320 --> 01:53.155
I'll help, but I started a new PE class.

01:53.447 --> 01:56.527
I've been avoiding it for three years,
but you can't run from running forever.

01:56.617 --> 01:58.910
I'm in PE too.
I made room in my trophy case.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.580
Then I remembered classes
don't give out trophies...

02:01.872 --> 02:03.498
so I put a fishbowl there instead.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.292
It's been quite the week.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.919
So the rest of us will have
to pick up the slack...

02:08.211 --> 02:10.422
and, yes, Jeffrey,
I assume you're out...

02:10.714 --> 02:14.009
because of your track record
of literally being too cool for school.

02:14.301 --> 02:16.637
Actually, you can count me in
on this one.

02:16.928 --> 02:19.139
- What?
- You had me at "no Pierce."

02:19.431 --> 02:21.767
He's been all over me lately
to hang out. It's weird.

02:22.059 --> 02:23.977
You just want to be a part
of something.

02:24.269 --> 02:27.814
Admit it, Thanksgiving softened
that Winger underbelly.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.067
Britta.

02:30.359 --> 02:32.986
Now, let's set sail
and hunt that whale.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.822
- Yeah.
- Hey, let's do this.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.658
You know
what the commercial says.

02:37.949 --> 02:40.285
"Keep your damn hands
off my Let's."

02:42.371 --> 02:44.206
♪ Give me some more
Time in a dream ♪

02:44.498 --> 02:47.584
♪ Give me the hope
To run out of steam ♪

02:47.876 --> 02:50.712
♪ Somebody said It can be here ♪

02:51.004 --> 02:54.925
♪ We could be roped up
Tied up dead in a year ♪

02:55.217 --> 02:59.721
♪ I can't count the reasons
I should stay ♪

03:00.013 --> 03:03.975
♪ One by one they all
Just fade away ♪

03:09.106 --> 03:10.982
Hey, Jeff, there you are.

03:11.274 --> 03:14.152
I was thinking we could swing by
this great barbershop I know.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.948
You're looking a little stubbly and
nobody handles a razor like an Italian.

03:18.240 --> 03:21.493
They develop nimble fingers
from pleasing their mistresses.

03:21.785 --> 03:24.371
Thank you for opening my eyes
to two new stereotypes.

03:24.913 --> 03:28.375
Now, how can I put this?
No, I don't want to go.

03:28.667 --> 03:31.628
Not now, not ever. No.

03:32.921 --> 03:34.506
No prob.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.717
We'll work around your skedge.

03:38.260 --> 03:39.636
- Okay. Pierce is gone.
- Yes.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.305
Walking Dead has left.
Resume Operation Deadliest Catch.

03:42.597 --> 03:46.476
Archie is gonna love this banner.
The name-brand glitter really shows.

03:46.768 --> 03:51.648
- School board guys in the hizzy.
- Richie. Richie, pace yourself.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.276
Hey, there, dean.
Just thought we'd pop in...

03:54.568 --> 03:56.194
and check on the big whale hunt.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.030
What a day we have planned
for young Archie.

03:59.322 --> 04:02.159
Library tour,
calculator lab demonstration...

04:02.451 --> 04:06.371
And it all culminates in
the Spirit of Greendale reception.

04:06.663 --> 04:07.998
Magnitude is a soft yes.

04:08.290 --> 04:09.750
That's a get.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.585
As much as we love
that Magnitude...

04:11.877 --> 04:15.714
- your tour may be lacking a little...
- Tour sucks, bro.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.923
- What?
- You gotta think big.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.428
- Hookers, blow, hookers.
- Oh, my.

04:21.720 --> 04:24.848
He's been mixing.
But there is some wisdom there.

04:25.140 --> 04:28.018
We need this whale money.
The kid likes snowboarding.

04:28.310 --> 04:32.189
Maybe Shaun White finds his way
on the faculty roster.

04:32.481 --> 04:35.984
He likes to party.
Maybe Greendale suddenly has a frat.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.361
The Delta Cubes or whatever.

04:38.653 --> 04:41.865
- You're not considering this, are you?
- No. Greendale stands on its own.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.618
No hookers, no blow,
no Shaun White frat.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.620
College dean threatening
a fraternity.

04:48.997 --> 04:50.749
You'll never shut down
the Delta Cubes.

04:51.041 --> 04:53.376
- What?
- Delta Cubes, Delta Cubes...

04:53.668 --> 04:55.879
Look, it's your call, Craig.

04:56.171 --> 04:58.548
Don't let this whale swim away.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.635
Cruise by Skeeper's Express
for a refill?

05:01.927 --> 05:03.094
I'll second that motion.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.808
Been working on victory dances.

05:08.099 --> 05:09.601
Basketball...

05:09.893 --> 05:11.603
football...

05:11.895 --> 05:14.147
and crab soccer.
That one's the hard one.

05:14.439 --> 05:15.816
That's nice.

05:16.107 --> 05:17.901
Hey, when I was in grade school...

05:18.193 --> 05:21.446
PE was about being picked on
and picked last...

05:21.738 --> 05:23.615
but you'll put me on your team,
right?

05:23.907 --> 05:25.283
Right. But also wrong.

05:26.201 --> 05:29.162
- PE is about survival of the fittest.
- Line up, class.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.167
Welcome to PEE.
I'm Coach Jason Chapman.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.211
Physical Education Education?

05:36.503 --> 05:38.672
Thought that was a typo
in the course "cartalog."

05:38.964 --> 05:40.257
It started as a typo...

05:40.549 --> 05:43.593
but it's grown into one of Greendale's
most successful programmes.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.136
Anyone can take PE.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.848
I teach my student coaches
to teach PE.

05:49.891 --> 05:52.310
- Something funny, Coach Barnes?
- No, it's just...

05:52.602 --> 05:54.354
You're teaching us
how to be gym teachers.

05:54.646 --> 05:58.024
Gym teachers?
A gym is a building...

05:58.316 --> 06:01.945
a man-made structure inside
which physical education teachers...

06:02.445 --> 06:05.657
teach physical education
to physical education students.

06:05.949 --> 06:08.952
Pop quiz, Coach Barnes. A student is
choking on a plastic golf ball.

06:09.244 --> 06:10.453
- What do you do?
- I...

06:10.745 --> 06:13.206
How many cones does it take
to line a soccer field?

06:13.498 --> 06:16.209
What if students are talking
during stretches?

06:16.501 --> 06:20.130
When my kids talk past bedtime,
I use my angry voice and I say:

06:20.422 --> 06:23.633
"The next peep I hear will be the last."
And I give them one of these:

06:23.925 --> 06:24.925
Not bad, Coach Bennett.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.221
- Look at me.
- I see you.

06:30.932 --> 06:32.058
Two hours late?

06:32.350 --> 06:35.395
It's the lack of follow-through
that makes Archie so appealing...

06:35.687 --> 06:37.188
but still send a text, right?

06:37.814 --> 06:41.067
Okay, Abed, I told you
we're not doing the fraternity idea.

06:41.359 --> 06:43.987
Delta Cubes will never die.
We've only just begun to fight.

06:44.279 --> 06:46.072
You only began yesterday.

06:46.364 --> 06:49.576
- Whale, ho. Look alive, everyone.
- What are you guys all doing out here?

06:49.868 --> 06:52.662
- Oh, no. Pierce will ruin everything.
- What's an Archie?

06:52.954 --> 06:55.206
- Why does he get a banner?
- Jeff, do something.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.300
There you are, Pierce. Thought
you were gonna cancel our plans.

07:05.592 --> 07:07.510
- Plans?
- To spend the entire day together...

07:07.802 --> 07:09.220
away from everyone else.

07:10.347 --> 07:12.933
Oh, yeah. Those plans.

07:13.850 --> 07:16.436
Suck it, bozos. You're getting ditched
by the cool kids.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.940
Oh, what a day we're gonna have.
Text me the instant I can ditch him.

07:21.191 --> 07:23.068
Hey, guys. Sweet campus.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.569
Welcome to Greendale.

07:24.861 --> 07:27.948
I'm Bean Pelton. "Bean" Pelton?
Dean Pelton. Gosh, I'm nervous.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.116
Please enroll in our school,
please, please.

07:30.575 --> 07:32.202
Nice scooter, Archie.

07:32.494 --> 07:34.204
City College gave it to me
as a present.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.873
City College?
City College bought you a Vespa?

07:37.165 --> 07:38.792
Brand-new.

07:40.210 --> 07:43.588
So, Archie, have you heard about our
Half-Pipes and Hash Pipes class?

07:43.880 --> 07:46.257
- Taught by Professor Shaun White.
- What?

07:46.549 --> 07:49.552
Yeah. Let me tell you about it
in our Mountain Dew Cool Zone Tent.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.484
Put up a tent,
write "Mountain Dew" on it.

07:51.763 --> 07:54.057
Here we go. Let's keep going.
This is our library.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.815
Okay. Archie, why don't you
hang 10 on the web...

08:02.107 --> 08:04.401
while I talk business.
And you know what?

08:04.693 --> 08:06.945
- You can take that computer.
- Sweet.

08:07.237 --> 08:10.490
- I can drop it off an overpass.
- I shouldn't have heard that.

08:10.991 --> 08:13.410
Dean, you're giving him
our computers?

08:13.702 --> 08:17.372
Because he is a 22-year-old stonerhead
whose parents bought him a GED.

08:17.664 --> 08:19.165
Which college is
he going to choose?

08:19.457 --> 08:22.335
Vespa State
or Look at our Library University?

08:22.627 --> 08:24.129
Those school board guys were right.

08:24.421 --> 08:26.297
- Britta, where do we get drugs?
- Really?

08:26.715 --> 08:28.299
Look who stumbled
onto the high road.

08:28.591 --> 08:29.634
This is a slippery slope.

08:29.926 --> 08:32.886
City College slipped that slope
when they slipped him that scooter.

08:33.179 --> 08:36.558
But they sure slipped up
when they let him set foot on our soil.

08:37.392 --> 08:39.936
Three, two, one.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.605
Time!

08:43.481 --> 08:47.694
Coach Barnes, it seems dodge ball
storage isn't quite in your skill set...

08:47.986 --> 08:50.280
much like table tennis prep.

08:50.572 --> 08:51.948
Excellent job, Coach Bennett.

08:52.240 --> 08:55.118
You have the spatial reasoning skills
of a young Kevin Miller...

08:55.410 --> 08:57.203
a really good PE teacher I know.

08:57.495 --> 09:01.041
The skill of ranking others
in order of ability is crucial.

09:01.332 --> 09:03.918
In this next drill,
our two best student coaches...

09:04.210 --> 09:07.297
will split the rest of the class.
Coach Bennett, Coach Neil.

09:07.589 --> 09:08.715
- Yeah.
- Pick your teams.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.675
- Coach Donovan.
- Coach Goldman.

09:10.967 --> 09:12.207
- Coach McKenna.
- Coach Cutler.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.054
- Coach Winston.
- Coach Dornetto.

09:14.345 --> 09:15.638
- Coach Guest.
- Coach Panos.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.892
Choose wisely.

09:19.184 --> 09:23.229
You're one decision away
from victory or defeat.

09:24.314 --> 09:27.192
Coach Marzec.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.696
Well picked, Coach Bennett.
Your team wins.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.573
We won. Nice.

09:34.699 --> 09:35.742
The barbershop.

09:36.034 --> 09:38.745
A reminder of a bygone era
when men were men...

09:39.037 --> 09:41.915
and women were sex cooks
who did laundry.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.042
I've been getting a shave here
for decades.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.337
And, apparently, reading the same
eight magazines the entire time.

09:47.629 --> 09:51.466
Yeah, National Geographic's got some
tribal boob shots that are exquisite.

09:51.758 --> 09:55.095
There's something about a breast that's
never been touched by white hands.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.263
You are a complicated man.

09:57.555 --> 09:59.349
Silvio, spin up lucky number seven.

10:05.313 --> 10:09.484
You know what?
That feels good, I'll give you that.

10:10.276 --> 10:13.947
Now that soda goblet gets
you free refills in the cafeteria...

10:14.239 --> 10:17.200
and it was painted
by our Professor Ed Hardy.

10:17.784 --> 10:20.954
- Who teaches bikini class.
- Oh, yeah!

10:22.497 --> 10:25.125
Check out that bling. I want that.

10:25.416 --> 10:27.919
You heard him, Annie.
Bling the king.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.630
- Just take it off of him. There you go.
- Thank you.

10:30.922 --> 10:33.967
Delta Cubes, prepare to bond
through embarrassment.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.094
Pacifiers in.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.638
Commence...
Code Dean! Code Dean!

10:38.930 --> 10:42.642
Gosh dean it, Abed.
I told you, no fraternities!

10:42.934 --> 10:44.727
There's soda all over my kicks.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.814
Britta, give Archie your scarf
so he can dry his kicks.

10:48.106 --> 10:50.150
- Dry his kicks. Put your back into it.
- No.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.318
Line drawn.

10:52.610 --> 10:54.737
If I wanted to wait on a rich man
hand and foot...

10:55.029 --> 10:57.991
I would've gone to Dubai
with that sheik I met at Trader Joe's.

10:59.367 --> 11:04.414
Don't worry about her, Archie.
Onward to the microbrew pizzatorium.

11:05.081 --> 11:08.376
I think all a man needs in life is
a close shave, a cold beer...

11:08.668 --> 11:11.379
and, you know,
maybe a faithful dog.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.883
I had a chocolate lab growing up.
Rosie.

11:15.341 --> 11:17.844
She used to wake me up
every morning by licking my feet.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.513
Mine was Walter,
a German Shepherd.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.473
Followed me to school every day.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.518
I'd look out the window
and there he was...

11:25.810 --> 11:28.354
dropping a steaming fat one
on the lawn.

11:28.646 --> 11:32.025
Would someone please tell me
why I've been shaving my own face...

11:32.317 --> 11:34.986
all these years like a sucker?

11:37.280 --> 11:39.991
This state-of-the-art
mock locker room...

11:40.283 --> 11:42.285
or "mocker room,"
simulates conditions...

11:42.577 --> 11:45.538
- of an actual locker room.
- Don't we have an actual locker room?

11:45.830 --> 11:48.208
You think you're ready for that,
Coach Barnes?

11:49.125 --> 11:52.795
For our next drill, drama students
will play the role of PE students...

11:53.087 --> 11:55.506
and you will oversee them
in a mocker room setting.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.176
My character just had
her first period.

11:58.468 --> 11:59.510
Mine has eczema.

11:59.802 --> 12:02.222
- Coach Bennett, care to go first?
- Yes.

12:05.600 --> 12:09.229
Keep your hands to yourself!
Running will get you five laps, mister.

12:09.979 --> 12:13.233
Joey! I will come in that shower
and kick your bare ass!

12:13.524 --> 12:14.525
Sorry, Coach Bennett.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.820
I have never seen
such natural disciplinary skills.

12:18.112 --> 12:21.032
You're up next, Coach Barnes.
Entertain us with your ineptitude.

12:24.702 --> 12:26.412
How's the foam machine coming,
Leonard?

12:26.704 --> 12:28.248
Memories will be made tonight.

12:28.748 --> 12:31.042
Destiny. Thank you for coming
on such short notice.

12:31.334 --> 12:35.296
Oh, I did get your Christmas card.
No. So... No, no. No time to pre-party.

12:35.588 --> 12:38.132
You and the girls get in position
and wait for my signal.

12:38.424 --> 12:40.093
- Strippers?
- Oh, tons.

12:40.677 --> 12:41.761
It's good for the school.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.765
The whale is here. Balloon drop, go.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.938
There you go. Release the whores.

12:52.647 --> 12:54.691
- Oh, yeah.
- No way!

12:58.194 --> 12:59.612
Pierce.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.908
I was wrong about this shop.
It really is special.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.287
Well, if you like the place so much,
why don't you gay marry it?

13:13.710 --> 13:17.964
You probably didn't notice, Jeff, but I've
been trying to get us some alone time.

13:18.256 --> 13:19.966
I might have picked up on that.

13:20.258 --> 13:22.468
I'm no stranger to father issues.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.138
I know confronting your dad
couldn't have been easy.

13:25.430 --> 13:28.016
And I just wanna say
I'm proud of you.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.600
Well...

13:30.435 --> 13:32.645
if you're so proud...

13:33.146 --> 13:35.815
why don't you gay marry me?

13:37.483 --> 13:41.571
You guys, behave! Hit the showers!
Everybody in the showers!

13:42.030 --> 13:44.490
Please, stop hitting each other!
Hit the showers!

13:44.782 --> 13:45.782
Cut! Scene!

13:46.200 --> 13:49.454
Shirley, help. I can't control these
drama students or their characters.

13:50.121 --> 13:51.331
No! No!

13:51.622 --> 13:53.458
PE is survival of the fittest, Troy.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.797
Hey, your phone's buzzing.

14:00.798 --> 14:03.593
It's from Annie. You sly dog.

14:03.885 --> 14:07.513
"Need more time.
Keep Pierce busy."

14:07.805 --> 14:09.474
Keep me busy?

14:09.766 --> 14:12.852
Look, the group is giving
some big shot a tour...

14:13.144 --> 14:16.939
so it's my job to keep you busy.
You know how you get jealous.

14:17.231 --> 14:19.359
So that's why you spent the day
with me?

14:19.650 --> 14:22.695
- You drew the short straw.
- Well, that's how it started...

14:22.987 --> 14:24.989
but I really did end up having
a good time.

14:25.281 --> 14:29.327
Yeah, I used to regret not having a son
to bring here.

14:29.619 --> 14:35.124
I'm glad I didn't have kids.
They just end up disappointing you.

14:41.631 --> 14:45.676
So, Archie, having a good time?
Getting cray up in this club?

14:45.968 --> 14:48.721
Sicker than ever, bro.
I've made my decision, dean.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.224
I'm about to get all up
in this Greendale.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.062
Human Beings, it's official.

14:56.354 --> 14:59.565
Say hello to our newest Greendalian,
Archie DeCoste!

15:02.276 --> 15:04.821
- Pop, pop!
- Pop, pop!

15:05.113 --> 15:06.739
I want that to be my thing now.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.992
I don't think you can do that.

15:12.829 --> 15:16.666
Magnitude, you're not to say
"pop, pop" ever again.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.544
- Not pop?
- That's right. Find a new thing.

15:20.586 --> 15:21.921
Get him out of here.

15:22.213 --> 15:24.674
Here we go! We're back!

15:26.000 --> 15:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:33.015 --> 15:34.434
Pop, pop!

15:42.275 --> 15:43.275
Well, we did it.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.736
We did what we had to do
and I feel great about it.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.989
- It's all for Greendale.
- All for Greendale.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.366
You look sad for someone
whose Forensics Club...

15:50.658 --> 15:53.619
can now afford that
state-of-the-art body farm.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.121
I can smell the corpses now.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.290
None of this is weighing on you?

15:57.582 --> 16:00.626
The only thing weighing on me
is tons and tons of whale money.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.753
- Jeffrey.
- Hey. Landed a whale, huh?

16:03.045 --> 16:05.298
Yeah, but I'm starting to feel
like maybe we...

16:05.590 --> 16:08.134
Archie goes to Greendale now.
Moving forward, Annie.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.553
We all paid a price.
Don't hear Jeffrey grumbling.

16:10.845 --> 16:12.805
And he had to spend a day
with Walking Dead.

16:13.097 --> 16:14.297
- That's true.
- You know what?

16:14.557 --> 16:16.309
I can't believe I'm gonna say this.

16:16.601 --> 16:18.102
Don't talk about Pierce like that.

16:18.394 --> 16:19.937
Look, maybe the only reason...

16:20.229 --> 16:23.232
he can be so unpleasant is
because we expect him to be.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.443
If we don't treat him
like such a dick...

16:25.735 --> 16:27.904
Well, he'll still be one
98 percent of the time...

16:28.196 --> 16:31.824
but the 2 percent he's tolerable,
it might be worth it.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.413
Who put the salt in his cereal, huh?

16:37.705 --> 16:40.333
Look, I for one am still proud of
what we did for Greendale.

16:43.085 --> 16:46.589
I've been up all night
trying out new catchphrases.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.636
Diggity doo?

16:52.678 --> 16:54.347
My God, what have we done?

16:55.765 --> 16:58.142
I thought you dropped PEE.

16:58.434 --> 17:01.187
I did, but I lost my keys
in the mocker.

17:01.479 --> 17:04.022
I had to hitchhike home last night
in a burrito truck.

17:04.315 --> 17:05.525
It's not as fun as it sounds.

17:06.025 --> 17:09.028
- I'm sorry for how I acted in class.
- Don't apologise.

17:09.319 --> 17:11.030
You were the fittest. You survived.

17:11.321 --> 17:14.534
Still, no one deserves to be mocked
for being mock-locked...

17:14.825 --> 17:16.243
in a mock locker.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.496
Friends should help friends survive.

17:19.789 --> 17:20.998
Oh, jeez! Hi.

17:23.291 --> 17:27.672
So I'm gonna help you learn to teach
the most unteachable student there is.

17:59.996 --> 18:01.414
Well done, Coach Barnes.

18:01.706 --> 18:03.040
You as well, Coach Bennett.

18:03.499 --> 18:06.502
You know, I was supposed to teach
you two to teach other people...

18:06.794 --> 18:09.755
but, instead,
you ended up teaching me.

18:11.674 --> 18:13.259
I did it.

18:13.551 --> 18:15.595
I used the water fountain.

18:17.888 --> 18:19.724
Archie, wake up.

18:20.016 --> 18:22.393
Chillax, bro. It's not even noon.

18:22.685 --> 18:24.770
I will neither chill nor relax.

18:25.062 --> 18:27.523
All this hoopla is not
what Greendale really is.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.735
Greendale is a nice welcome banner.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.613
Greendale is a foamless cafeteria.

18:33.904 --> 18:38.284
And Greendale is Magnitude saying,
"pop, pop."

18:38.576 --> 18:41.746
Now, I am a man of very little integrity
and I let students get away...

18:42.038 --> 18:43.706
with practically anything
on campus.

18:43.998 --> 18:48.794
But I will not allow Greendale to lose
the things that make it Greendale.

18:49.253 --> 18:51.297
I would love for you to enroll
in my school...

18:51.589 --> 18:53.549
but I will not change it for you.

18:53.841 --> 18:58.471
Greendale will stay Greendale,
no matter what.

19:00.723 --> 19:03.059
You know what?
Everybody kisses my ass...

19:03.351 --> 19:05.144
because my dad is loaded.

19:05.936 --> 19:09.482
And they always give me free stuff,
like that Jet Ski I sunk.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.818
But it would be pretty sweet
to be treated like a normal dude.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.488
So I'm in.

19:17.573 --> 19:21.827
Magnitude. You usually have
the perfect blend of brevity and wit...

19:22.119 --> 19:24.163
that sums up situations like this.

19:25.039 --> 19:26.123
Pop, pop!

19:27.708 --> 19:30.336
- Oh, that's so good!
- So good!

19:30.628 --> 19:34.632
I think we all learned today that
all human beings deserve dignity.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.344
Delta Cubes, Delta Cubes,
Delta Cubes!

19:38.636 --> 19:42.056
Delta Cubes, Delta Cubes,
Delta Cubes!

19:42.348 --> 19:44.350
Delta Cubes,
Operation Slack Attack.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.352
- Slack Attack?
- Oh, yeah.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.438
Delta Cubes, Delta Cubes...

19:49.730 --> 19:53.526
Mark my words, Delta Cubes,
you'll pay for this!

20:03.035 --> 20:05.329
- Is this seat taken?
- Free country.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.796
You know, I was thinking...

20:14.505 --> 20:16.757
I might start coming here
more often.

20:18.467 --> 20:19.510
I like the vibe.

20:22.680 --> 20:26.642
You know what sport I never got?
Golf.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.812
No argument here.

20:30.104 --> 20:32.189
They lost me immediately
with the clown clothes.

20:32.481 --> 20:35.484
You know, I belong to a dozen
country clubs. Never played.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.403
I just hit on the waitresses.

20:37.862 --> 20:39.780
Something about
a country club waitress...

20:40.072 --> 20:42.700
that just makes you wanna
pay your dues every year.

21:01.427 --> 21:03.888
Get your damn hand off of my Let's.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.768
Honestly, after all that,
you still eat Splingles?

21:09.059 --> 21:11.645
Yeah, Troy. Splingles have
30 percent less fat.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.731
They're the fit chip.

21:14.273 --> 21:17.067
You know, I kind of have a headache.
Maybe you should go home.
