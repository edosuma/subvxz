WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:01.269
.

00:01.302 --> 00:02.203
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:02.836 --> 00:03.837
sexually based offenses

00:03.871 --> 00:06.507
are considered
especially heinous.

00:06.540 --> 00:09.110
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.143 --> 00:10.611
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.644 --> 00:12.280
are members of an elite squad

00:12.313 --> 00:14.382
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.415 --> 00:16.350
These are their stories.

00:22.556 --> 00:24.158
- Zoe.

00:24.192 --> 00:25.459
- The Hang Seng is crashing
right now.

00:25.493 --> 00:26.627
Do you want me to call
the guys in Hong Kong?

00:26.660 --> 00:28.096
- No, no.

00:28.129 --> 00:29.297
You should have a drink.

00:29.330 --> 00:31.165
Take a night off.
Have some fun.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.600
- I'm trying.

00:33.834 --> 00:35.403
Eli's happy.

00:35.436 --> 00:36.837
- Well, when you're worth 3 bil,

00:36.870 --> 00:39.807
it's easy
to get the serotonin flowin'.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.576
- Roger. Zoe.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.212
Thank you for your hard work.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.579
- Our pleasure.

00:45.613 --> 00:47.548
You know, I think
it's gonna be a home run, Eli.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.650
- Better be
with the fees I'm paying.

00:49.683 --> 00:51.585
- Nothing good comes cheap.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.087
Not on Wall Street.

00:53.121 --> 00:56.290
- Well, I appreciate
your hard work, Roger.

00:56.324 --> 00:59.293
And I appreciate your hard work.

00:59.327 --> 01:00.594
- Thank you.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.364
- He's gonna take the credit,
of course.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.433
But I know
that you found this deal

01:05.466 --> 01:08.136
and set the whole thing
in motion, so...

01:08.169 --> 01:09.603
thank you.

01:09.637 --> 01:11.105
- Cheers.

01:20.248 --> 01:23.184
- Wine?
- Oh. No, thank you.

01:23.217 --> 01:24.518
- You might want
to rethink that.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.887
DRC. 1978.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.422
- Not a wine connoisseur.

01:28.456 --> 01:31.125
- I paid $1.6 million
for 112 bottles.

01:31.159 --> 01:33.227
That's over $3,500 a glass.

01:33.261 --> 01:34.862
- Don't waste something
that unique on me.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.597
I have a very
unsophisticated palate.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.333
Stop! No.
Thank you.

01:39.367 --> 01:43.504
- [laughs]
All right.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.408
- Rookie move.

01:47.441 --> 01:48.642
- What are you talking about?

01:48.676 --> 01:50.678
- Three rules of Wall Street:

01:50.711 --> 01:55.716
never tell the truth,
never use your own money,

01:55.749 --> 01:58.352
and never say no to a client.

01:58.386 --> 01:59.487
- Okay.

02:05.393 --> 02:08.462
Still pouring that DRC?

02:08.496 --> 02:10.331
- [chuckles]

02:13.601 --> 02:16.404
All right, well,
guys, stay on it.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.572
Hey.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.374
- I-I didn't know
we had a meeting.

02:20.408 --> 02:23.177
- Roger called this morning
about some Chinese media company

02:23.211 --> 02:25.746
we can get
for four times EBITDA.

02:25.779 --> 02:27.181
- That's cheap.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.649
- Well, you get
what you pay for.

02:28.682 --> 02:30.251
- Not when you work
with Cromwell Moore.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.519
Get what you don't pay for.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.587
That's why you're so rich.

02:33.621 --> 02:35.323
- So, last night.

02:35.356 --> 02:36.657
That was fun.

02:37.691 --> 02:40.661
We should do it again.
[chuckles]

02:46.700 --> 02:48.402
- So? Any word?

02:48.436 --> 02:50.671
- No. Stop asking.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.206
- All right,
it's just, you know,

02:52.240 --> 02:53.674
Sergeant Tutuola's got
a nice ring to it.

02:53.707 --> 02:56.477
Hey, what is a ten-letter word
for "bad luck"?

02:56.510 --> 02:58.746
- Misfortune.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.249
Hi. Can I help you?

03:01.282 --> 03:03.551
- Uh, yes. I need
to speak to a detective.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.286
- Okay, I'm Lieutenant Benson.

03:07.255 --> 03:10.190
Okay, how about
we step into my office?

03:11.559 --> 03:13.561
How can I help you?

03:13.594 --> 03:16.297
- I was raped.

03:16.330 --> 03:18.532
- Okay.

03:18.566 --> 03:21.235
I'm very sorry to hear that.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.471
- Yeah, um, I-I don't know
how this works, so...

03:23.504 --> 03:25.306
- No worries.

03:25.339 --> 03:28.476
We're just gonna take it
one step at a time.

03:28.509 --> 03:31.312
Do you have any idea
who did this to you?

03:31.345 --> 03:32.713
- Yes.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.214
- Okay.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.286
- Him.

03:43.824 --> 03:45.826
- Eli Colton?

03:45.859 --> 03:47.428
- Yeah.

03:47.461 --> 03:49.730
King of Wall Street.

03:54.768 --> 03:57.738
[dramatic music]

04:40.948 --> 04:41.715
I was at a party
at Eli's penthouse.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.019
We'd just closed a deal.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.021
- Okay, so you and Eli
work together?

04:48.055 --> 04:49.923
- Sort of.
I work at an investment bank.

04:49.957 --> 04:51.792
Cromwell Moore.
- Uh-huh.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.461
- Eli's firm is
our biggest client.

04:53.494 --> 04:54.462
- Got it.

04:54.495 --> 04:55.529
- He invited a bunch of people

04:55.563 --> 04:56.864
back to his apartment

04:56.897 --> 04:58.031
after the dinner.

04:58.065 --> 04:59.900
We were celebrating
his latest acquisition.

04:59.933 --> 05:01.469
- So first you went to dinner,

05:01.502 --> 05:03.003
and then you went
to his apartment.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.071
- Yeah.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.442
Um...

05:11.078 --> 05:13.814
I ended up in his bedroom.

05:16.884 --> 05:20.053
He wanted to show me
his watch collection.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.422
Anyway...

05:23.557 --> 05:25.559
He kissed me,

05:25.593 --> 05:27.795
and I-I did kiss him back.

05:27.828 --> 05:28.962
You know, we were having fun.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.831
- Of course.

05:30.864 --> 05:34.968
So, Zoe, just tell me
exactly what happened, okay?

05:38.105 --> 05:41.475
- A few minutes later,
he tried to take my dress off.

05:41.509 --> 05:46.013
I told him
I did not want to have sex.

05:46.046 --> 05:50.418
But he...
he threw me down on the bed,

05:50.451 --> 05:53.554
and, uh--and I tried
to push him off.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.657
I tried so hard
to get him off of me.

05:56.690 --> 06:00.561
I screamed,
but he just covered my mouth.

06:00.594 --> 06:03.063
- Okay, do you remember
anything else?

06:03.096 --> 06:05.666
Any other details?

06:05.699 --> 06:08.469
- Yeah.

06:08.502 --> 06:13.441
Staring at his stupid $4 million
watch on the night stand.

06:13.474 --> 06:18.145
I just watched the hand
go around and around

06:18.178 --> 06:20.113
till it was over.

06:20.147 --> 06:24.117
- Okay, did he say anything
when it was over?

06:24.151 --> 06:26.186
- Yeah.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.555
He winked at me and said,

06:27.588 --> 06:31.058
"I hope you had just as much fun
as I did,"

06:31.091 --> 06:32.660
and then
he jumped in the shower.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.863
- Okay, and what time was this?

06:35.896 --> 06:38.599
- 3:05 a.m.

06:38.632 --> 06:41.101
- Have you told anybody
about what happened?

06:41.134 --> 06:42.470
- Yeah, I did.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.605
I told my boss, Roger,
this morning.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.673
- Okay.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.041
- And he told me
to think it over.

06:49.510 --> 06:51.144
- Think it over?

06:51.178 --> 06:53.180
- His exact words were,
"Be careful.

06:53.213 --> 06:55.716
It's never easy
to kill the king."

06:59.219 --> 07:02.623
- I'm confused--are you
saying that Zoe was raped?

07:02.656 --> 07:03.624
- Yes.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.659
And now I'm confused because

07:05.693 --> 07:07.027
she told you that this morning.

07:07.060 --> 07:10.197
- Well, she never said "rape."

07:10.230 --> 07:13.166
I thought that she was just...
upset and regretful.

07:13.200 --> 07:15.469
- Do you remember
her exact words?

07:15.503 --> 07:17.037
- No.

07:17.070 --> 07:18.506
Not really.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.007
She said things got weird

07:20.040 --> 07:22.042
between her and Eli.

07:22.075 --> 07:24.111
That he was aggressive.

07:24.144 --> 07:27.648
But, in all honesty,
I think that she seemed

07:27.681 --> 07:29.750
more worried
about appearances.

07:29.783 --> 07:31.552
She didn't want people
talking about her

07:31.585 --> 07:33.120
or--or what happened,

07:33.153 --> 07:34.955
but I didn't realize that...

07:36.223 --> 07:37.190
If I knew that she'd been raped,

07:37.224 --> 07:39.727
I would've been the first
to call the police.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.261
- Good afternoon, detectives.

07:41.294 --> 07:42.262
Dan Hewitt. CEO.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.998
- Lieutenant Benson. SVU.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.634
This is Detective Tutuola.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.201
- I heard what happened.
I'm shocked.

07:48.235 --> 07:51.071
- You heard?
Who told you?

07:51.104 --> 07:53.106
- Well, employees are
the most important asset

07:53.140 --> 07:54.708
a corporation possesses.

07:54.742 --> 07:56.644
Of course, you can count on
my full cooperation.

07:56.677 --> 07:57.778
- Well, great because

07:57.811 --> 07:59.647
we definitely have
some more questions.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.081
- I'm sure you do,
but right now,

08:01.114 --> 08:04.284
Roger and I need to speak
with our general counsel.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.019
You understand?

08:06.053 --> 08:07.688
- Uh, no, actually, I don't.

08:07.721 --> 08:10.257
- [chuckles]
We'll be in touch.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.593
Again,
if there's anything I can do.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.263
- Okay...

08:18.599 --> 08:19.967
- Mr. Colton,

08:20.000 --> 08:22.736
Detectives Carisi and Rollins
from SVU are here.

08:22.770 --> 08:24.204
- SVU?

08:24.237 --> 08:25.806
Special Victims Unit, right?

08:25.839 --> 08:27.174
Well, how can I help you?

08:27.207 --> 08:28.776
- We're here about Zoe White.

08:28.809 --> 08:31.011
- Zoe? Why?
What happened?

08:31.044 --> 08:32.112
I just saw her this morning.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.246
- Did you see her last night?

08:33.280 --> 08:35.315
- Yeah.
I had a couple people over, why?

08:35.348 --> 08:36.617
- Were you alone with her?

08:36.650 --> 08:38.251
Maybe between 2:00
and 3:00 a.m.?

08:40.020 --> 08:42.122
- Liza, could you show
these detectives out?

08:42.155 --> 08:43.557
Sorry, guys.

08:43.591 --> 08:45.092
This meeting's over.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.594
- We're not accusing you
of anything.

08:46.627 --> 08:48.261
We just want to hear
your side of the story.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.030
- I'd just prefer
to have my lawyer present

08:50.063 --> 08:52.032
for any formal discussions.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.667
If you want to talk
about this more,

08:53.701 --> 08:56.036
just contact her,
and we'll set up a meeting.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.806
Can you get them her card?
- Before we go...

08:58.839 --> 09:01.141
can we just have the names
of all the people that...

09:01.174 --> 09:03.210
were there
at the apartment last night?

09:03.243 --> 09:04.745
I mean, lawyer or no lawyer,

09:04.778 --> 09:07.180
we're obviously gonna find out
for ourselves,

09:07.214 --> 09:10.050
so I mean, just,
why make us waste our time?

09:10.083 --> 09:12.319
- Well, that's a good point.
I hate inefficiency.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.622
It drives me nuts--
people just wasting time,

09:14.655 --> 09:16.089
activity
for the sake of activity.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.658
You got a pen?
- Yep.

09:17.691 --> 09:20.293
- Roger Littrell, Allison Kring,

09:20.327 --> 09:24.264
Zoe White, Zoya...
oh, gosh, what's her last name?

09:24.297 --> 09:26.066
I don't think
she has a last name.

09:26.099 --> 09:28.636
She's a model.

09:28.669 --> 09:30.671
- Yeah, I remember her.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.272
- Did you see her and Eli
hanging out?

09:32.305 --> 09:35.042
- Yes.
She was very...determined.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.143
- That makes sense.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.344
He's a--
he's a good catch, right?

09:37.377 --> 09:41.181
- He's the holy grail--
rich, fun, decent-looking.

09:41.214 --> 09:43.617
Let's face it, most
billionaires are disgusting.

09:43.651 --> 09:45.285
But he's a total player.

09:45.318 --> 09:47.187
He goes from girl
to girl to girl,

09:47.220 --> 09:49.256
and word is, he doesn't
even give parting gifts.

09:49.289 --> 09:52.192
I mean, if you're
gonna shag a billionaire,

09:52.225 --> 09:54.662
you deserve something.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.063
- That's one way
of looking at it.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.632
- Okay, listen.
Back to Eli and Zoe, all right?

09:58.666 --> 10:01.702
Do you remember anything else?
Anything specific?

10:01.735 --> 10:03.804
- I saw them walk upstairs
to his bedroom.

10:03.837 --> 10:05.072
Late at night.

10:05.105 --> 10:06.707
Hand in hand.

10:06.740 --> 10:08.275
And I remember feeling relieved.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.810
- Why's that?

10:09.843 --> 10:11.679
- Because I knew
I didn't have to sleep with him.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.280
- Excuse me?

10:13.313 --> 10:16.283
- This guy at Cromwell Moore--
Roger something--

10:16.316 --> 10:18.185
paid me $20,000
to come to the party

10:18.218 --> 10:19.753
and be Eli's date.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.154
Eli didn't know, of course.

10:21.188 --> 10:23.824
Roger told him we were friends
from the Hamptons.

10:23.857 --> 10:27.394
Anyway, I was thrilled
when Eli went upstairs with Zoe.

10:27.427 --> 10:29.863
Win-win.
Got to keep the 20 grand,

10:29.897 --> 10:32.232
and I didn't have to sleep
with him.

10:32.265 --> 10:34.167
Plus, I met a really cute guy.

10:34.201 --> 10:35.869
Nate.

10:35.903 --> 10:37.337
- So, you and Zoya
were hanging out.

10:37.370 --> 10:39.239
Do you remember
seeing Eli and Zoe together?

10:39.272 --> 10:40.874
- Yes, but I didn't notice
anything unusual.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.375
- What time did you leave
the party?

10:42.409 --> 10:44.311
- Around 12:00. I'm not
really into the party scene.

10:44.344 --> 10:46.279
I went there
to fly the Cromwell flag.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.381
- Do you remember seeing Zoe
at work the next day?

10:48.415 --> 10:50.183
- Yeah. She seemed distracted.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.419
- Did she mention anything
about what happened?

10:52.452 --> 10:53.854
- No,
but let's cut to the chase.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.323
If Zoe said that Eli
assaulted her, he did.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.725
- Why, 'cause she's honest?

10:57.758 --> 11:00.160
- Because she's smart.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.762
Zoe's the most driven woman
I know.

11:01.795 --> 11:03.731
She grew up middle-class
in Reading, Pennsylvania,

11:03.764 --> 11:05.165
worked her ass off,
went to Harvard,

11:05.198 --> 11:06.366
got her MBA from Stanford--

11:06.399 --> 11:08.235
there's no way
she would risk everything

11:08.268 --> 11:11.138
just to go after Eli,
unless it were true.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.673
There's no upside to burning
a bridge with the King.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.712
- Security footage
from Eli's lobby confirms

11:18.746 --> 11:19.913
there were 20 people
at the party.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.381
So far, we talked to 11 of them.

11:21.414 --> 11:22.716
- Okay. Anything interesting?

11:22.750 --> 11:23.884
- They all say the same thing.

11:23.917 --> 11:26.486
Eli and Zoe were flirting,
having fun, but nothing unusual.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.856
- Okay.
What about photos? Videos?

11:28.889 --> 11:29.890
- Nothing so far.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.491
- Zoe's rape kit came back.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.493
Internal bruising consistent
with rough sex

11:33.526 --> 11:34.828
or sexual assault,

11:34.862 --> 11:36.363
and there were traces
of semen too.

11:36.396 --> 11:37.497
I ran it through CODIS.
There's no match in the system.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.466
- Great. Get a warrant
for Eli's DNA.

11:40.934 --> 11:42.335
Mr. Colton.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.004
What brings you here?

11:44.037 --> 11:46.406
- The sooner we put this
to rest, the better.

11:46.439 --> 11:47.407
- I couldn't agree more.

11:47.440 --> 11:49.509
How about you give us
a sample of your DNA?

11:49.542 --> 11:52.813
- No need.
Mr. Colton's ready to talk.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.782
- Zoe and I had sex,

11:54.815 --> 11:57.317
it was consensual,
and we both had a great time.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.452
- Sure. We'll just take
your word for it.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.321
- Well, you don't have to.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.290
- This is an email sent
from Ms. White to Mr. Colton

12:03.323 --> 12:04.925
the day after the party.

12:04.958 --> 12:06.026
Our IT department confirmed

12:06.059 --> 12:08.295
it was sent
from her office computer.

12:08.328 --> 12:10.998
- "Glad we closed the deal. Ha.

12:11.031 --> 12:12.332
"Thinking about you.

12:12.365 --> 12:15.035
"Last night was amazing.

12:27.848 --> 12:27.981
.

12:28.982 --> 12:29.917
- "Glad we closed the deal"?
What the hell is this?

12:30.884 --> 12:34.087
- It's an email that
you allegedly sent to Eli

12:34.121 --> 12:35.789
the morning after the party.

12:35.823 --> 12:36.857
- I didn't write this.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.792
- According to our tech experts,

12:38.826 --> 12:41.261
the IP address matches
Cromwell Moore's networks,

12:41.294 --> 12:43.797
and they confirmed
that it specifically came

12:43.831 --> 12:44.998
from your computer.

12:45.032 --> 12:47.234
- We also checked
the digital sign-in log.

12:47.267 --> 12:50.871
You were at Cromwell Moore
from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m.

12:50.904 --> 12:52.172
- Yeah, I was.

12:52.205 --> 12:54.174
I'm not in my office
every second of the day.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.243
I mean, obviously,
somebody went into my office

12:56.276 --> 12:58.111
and sent this
from my computer.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.579
- You have any idea who?

12:59.612 --> 13:02.182
- No. But it wasn't me.

13:02.215 --> 13:05.152
- Well, great.
That's all we need to hear.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.320
- We'll send our people over,
have 'em dust for prints,

13:07.354 --> 13:11.992
touch DNA,
figure out who sent that email.

13:14.928 --> 13:16.163
- We're on your side.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.932
- Thank you.

13:18.966 --> 13:21.168
Either everybody at work
has no idea what's going on,

13:21.201 --> 13:22.269
or they're not acknowledging it,

13:22.302 --> 13:25.172
but it's making me
feel really alone.

13:25.205 --> 13:27.841
- You're not.

13:27.875 --> 13:29.242
I promise.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.347
- [sighs]

13:34.381 --> 13:35.916
- No luck on the keyboard.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.617
Techs couldn't find
any prints or DNA.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.152
Somebody must've wiped it down.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.954
- Okay, so we can't prove
that the email came

13:40.988 --> 13:42.322
from anyone other than Zoe.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.291
- Yeah, but it does prove
Eli's nervous.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.859
I mean, if you're innocent,

13:45.893 --> 13:47.260
you're not gonna send
phony emails

13:47.294 --> 13:48.395
from a victim's computer

13:48.428 --> 13:49.629
trying to get ahead
of the story.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.131
- Okay, so let's keep digging.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.299
- We talked to the last
of the party guests.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.401
- And?
- Nobody saw anything suspicious

13:54.434 --> 13:56.970
except cocaine--apparently,
Eli and some of the guests

13:57.004 --> 13:57.971
were hitting it pretty hard.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.873
- Okay, so we're back to Eli.

13:59.907 --> 14:02.242
Let's...dig into his past.

14:02.275 --> 14:04.945
Look at civil suits,
harassment complaints,

14:04.978 --> 14:07.414
any Wall Street gossip--
anything that can establish

14:07.447 --> 14:08.648
a pattern of behavior.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.617
And guys,
let's focus on his enemies,

14:10.650 --> 14:13.420
because his friends are too busy
getting rich off him.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.089
- Thanks for meeting with us,
Tyler.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.324
- Like I said on the phone,
we've got some questions

14:17.357 --> 14:18.358
about Eli Colton.

14:18.391 --> 14:19.659
- Yeah,
you guys worked together?

14:19.692 --> 14:20.660
- Yeah. Ten years.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.095
He was best man at my wedding.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.630
- Okay, so you guys were
good friends too, huh?

14:23.663 --> 14:25.265
- Well, yeah, till he fired me.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.967
- He didn't want to pay
your yearend bonus.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.368
That's what you alleged
in the lawsuit, right?

14:28.401 --> 14:31.371
- Yeah,
he owed me $80 million...

14:31.404 --> 14:33.406
so rather than cut me a check,
he blew me out.

14:33.440 --> 14:35.075
Litigation arbitrage.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.410
Spread between what is owed
and the expected payout,

14:37.444 --> 14:38.411
which in my case was zero

14:38.445 --> 14:39.412
'cause I lost.

14:39.446 --> 14:41.348
Cost me 2 mil in legal fees too.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.116
- Sorry to hear that.

14:43.150 --> 14:45.285
- Sorry?
[laughs]

14:45.318 --> 14:48.488
Taking it on the chin from Eli
was a godsend.

14:48.521 --> 14:50.457
Raised my profile, like, 10x,

14:50.490 --> 14:54.027
which in turn gave me a platform
to build this $4 billion fund.

14:54.061 --> 14:56.129
If anything, I owe Eli.

14:56.163 --> 14:58.298
So, yeah, anyway,
like I was saying on the phone,

14:58.331 --> 15:00.467
about three years ago,
there were some rumors flying

15:00.500 --> 15:02.135
that Eli raped someone.

15:02.169 --> 15:04.671
I assumed it was
just gossip, but...

15:04.704 --> 15:06.673
- Do you remember any details?
Any names?

15:06.706 --> 15:07.707
- No, it was just a rumor,

15:07.740 --> 15:08.741
but it had traction.

15:08.775 --> 15:11.411
And then one day,
it suddenly just disappeared.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.513
- Are you saying
that he paid her off?

15:13.546 --> 15:15.415
- Now, that would be unethical.

15:15.448 --> 15:16.516
- Can you think
of anyone in Eli's life

15:16.549 --> 15:17.951
who might know
something about this,

15:17.985 --> 15:19.319
might be willing to talk?

15:19.352 --> 15:21.488
- No, but you can probably track
down the woman yourself.

15:21.521 --> 15:23.923
She filed a police report.

15:28.328 --> 15:30.998
- Not sure what there is
to talk about.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.166
I recanted. I told the police
it was consensual.

15:33.200 --> 15:35.302
- Kate, we're not here
to judge you.

15:35.335 --> 15:40.040
Okay, we understand
how complex and how emotional

15:40.073 --> 15:42.175
these cases can be,
believe me.

15:42.209 --> 15:43.243
- We just want to know
what happened

15:43.276 --> 15:45.245
that night with Eli,

15:45.278 --> 15:47.214
because we think
he did it again.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.452
- I'm sorry to hear that.

15:52.485 --> 15:55.455
But I can't talk about it.

15:55.488 --> 15:58.025
I signed
a non-disclosure agreement.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.060
- Ah, he wrote you a check, huh?
- Fin.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.195
- Hey, I'm just talking straight
to her, okay?

16:02.229 --> 16:04.331
I know this is your life,

16:04.364 --> 16:06.433
but we have another victim,

16:06.466 --> 16:08.435
and I think
she deserves justice.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.071
- Look, Kate,

16:11.104 --> 16:14.041
we're not asking you
to go public,

16:14.074 --> 16:16.309
but we do need your help.

16:16.343 --> 16:19.212
We're just trying to figure out
what happened.

16:24.584 --> 16:27.020
- He...

16:28.521 --> 16:31.558
He said
he would destroy my career.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.560
My life.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.228
And let's face it,
no matter what I did

16:35.262 --> 16:37.097
or how hard the prosecutors
would have tried,

16:37.130 --> 16:39.466
he would have walked.

16:39.499 --> 16:43.236
And I'd be left
hanging in the wind.

16:43.270 --> 16:45.138
No way.

16:45.172 --> 16:48.175
I worked too hard
to just blow up my life.

16:48.208 --> 16:50.210
For free.

16:51.411 --> 16:55.382
I cut the best deal I could
given the hand I was dealt.

16:55.415 --> 16:56.483
That's what I did.

17:00.120 --> 17:03.623
The son of a bitch
still ruined my life.

17:03.656 --> 17:07.127
But hey, at least
I'm rich, right?

17:10.430 --> 17:12.565
- One last question.

17:12.599 --> 17:15.268
You said in the police report
that you filed--

17:15.302 --> 17:17.270
you stated that you and Eli had

17:17.304 --> 17:20.207
a preexisting
professional relationship.

17:20.240 --> 17:23.310
How did you two know each other?

17:23.343 --> 17:24.544
- Roger Littrell.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.079
Got a second?

17:26.113 --> 17:27.414
- I'm not talking to you
without a lawyer.

17:27.447 --> 17:30.117
- This isn't about Zoe.

17:30.150 --> 17:31.418
- Oh, yeah?

17:31.451 --> 17:33.420
You two looking to make
a few M&A deals?

17:33.453 --> 17:34.654
- No, we're actually here
to talk about

17:34.687 --> 17:37.624
a former associate of yours,
Kate Tompkins.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.559
- Yeah, I remember Kate.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.628
MIT. Wharton MBA.
Brilliant.

17:41.661 --> 17:42.629
- Yeah. Pretty too.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.297
Bet Eli liked working with her.

17:44.331 --> 17:46.599
- Eli raped her three years ago.
Then he paid her off.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.201
- I don't know anything
about that.

17:48.235 --> 17:50.437
- You were her supervisor.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.105
- Yeah, I supervise
lots of people.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.840
- Well, from where I sit,
it seems like you supervise

17:53.873 --> 17:55.175
pretty women who end up
getting assaulted

17:55.208 --> 17:56.409
by your biggest client.

17:56.443 --> 17:58.145
- It sounds like you need to get
better seats,

17:58.178 --> 18:00.447
because I got nothing to do
with this!

18:00.480 --> 18:02.215
I make Eli money.

18:02.249 --> 18:03.350
I find undervalued businesses

18:03.383 --> 18:05.585
that he can buy at a discount
and sell at a premium.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.120
Simple as that.

18:07.154 --> 18:09.589
And in the process,
I get rich too!

18:09.622 --> 18:13.126
As for his private life,
I don't know anything about it.

18:13.160 --> 18:15.695
- Even though he raped
two of your associates?

18:15.728 --> 18:17.497
- If he did, that's on him.

18:17.530 --> 18:19.299
- And you.

18:30.577 --> 18:30.710
.

18:30.743 --> 18:31.311
- Zoe White and Kate Tompkins:

18:32.345 --> 18:34.847
junior bankers both sexually
assaulted by Eli Colton,

18:34.881 --> 18:36.816
and they both worked
under Roger Littrell,

18:36.849 --> 18:38.218
Eli's go-to banker.

18:38.251 --> 18:40.153
- And chief fixer.

18:40.187 --> 18:42.522
Ten to one
he's who snuck into Zoe's office

18:42.555 --> 18:43.523
and sent that email.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.825
He's got way too much to lose
if Eli goes down.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.860
- So we have
a billionaire predator

18:47.894 --> 18:50.463
with a thing
for young, beautiful bankers.

18:50.497 --> 18:52.532
Problem is, we can't prove it

18:52.565 --> 18:54.734
because
the other victim recanted

18:54.767 --> 18:56.503
and signed a non-disclosure.

18:56.536 --> 18:57.604
- What else do we have on Eli?

18:57.637 --> 18:58.805
- Nothing that'll stick.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.673
It's still Zoe's word
against his.

19:00.707 --> 19:01.908
- Okay, so let's get warrants

19:01.941 --> 19:05.612
for his office, computers,
and his apartment.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.680
- Hey, Lieu.
You see this?

19:07.714 --> 19:08.848
The "Ledger" did an exposé

19:08.881 --> 19:10.250
on the "fabulous life"
of Eli Colton.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.285
Look who made a cameo.

19:12.319 --> 19:13.720
- "Fabulous friend Zoe White

19:13.753 --> 19:16.956
sunbathing
at Eli's Hamptons mansion."

19:16.989 --> 19:21.894
Wow, Eli's team is pulling out
every trick in the book.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.863
- This is insane.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.898
I am not his "fabulous friend."

19:25.932 --> 19:27.534
I'm a banker.

19:27.567 --> 19:29.236
I graduated third in my class
at business school.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.870
I'm not some bikini bimbo.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.505
- Okay.

19:32.539 --> 19:34.274
Where are these photos from?

19:34.307 --> 19:36.243
- Last summer,
Eli threw a party at his house

19:36.276 --> 19:37.544
in the Hamptons.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.745
Okay, I went with
a few work friends.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.880
Look, he wasn't even there
when these photos were taken.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.649
He flew to London
that Saturday morning.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.718
But he told everybody to stay
there and have a great weekend.

19:45.752 --> 19:46.986
- Was Roger at this party?

19:47.019 --> 19:49.789
- Yeah.
He has a house a mile away.

19:49.822 --> 19:51.791
- Okay.

19:51.824 --> 19:55.695
Zoe, do you remember
Roger taking any photos?

19:55.728 --> 19:59.266
- Yeah. Probably.
I mean, everybody was.

19:59.299 --> 20:01.801
- So is it possible
that Roger took these photos

20:01.834 --> 20:04.671
and--and he gave them to Eli?

20:04.704 --> 20:07.006
- I mean...he's my mentor.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.375
He's my--
he's my friend.

20:08.408 --> 20:10.310
I...

20:13.280 --> 20:16.883
I mean,
I thought he was my friend.

20:16.916 --> 20:18.685
Why would he throw me
under the bus?

20:18.718 --> 20:19.852
- To undermine your case.

20:19.886 --> 20:23.290
- This?
This is undermining my career!

20:23.323 --> 20:24.891
Bikini shots?

20:24.924 --> 20:27.026
I work 80 hours a week!

20:27.059 --> 20:28.861
Okay, this is the first time
that I had a break

20:28.895 --> 20:31.298
in--in over a year!

20:31.331 --> 20:32.865
- They're trying
to intimidate you.

20:32.899 --> 20:34.334
- Yeah, well, you know what,
it's starting to work.

20:34.367 --> 20:37.804
- So, Zoe, I-I hate
to ask you to do this,

20:37.837 --> 20:41.708
but I would like you
to walk us through what happened

20:41.741 --> 20:42.942
one last time.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.711
The more details, the better,

20:44.744 --> 20:47.046
even if you think
that they're meaningless.

20:47.079 --> 20:51.017
Anything that you could tell us
or remember would be helpful.

20:52.652 --> 20:56.323
- Eli and I were upstairs.

20:56.356 --> 20:58.858
I was looking at the watch.

20:58.891 --> 21:01.361
There was music playing.

21:01.394 --> 21:02.429
We were kissing.

21:04.897 --> 21:07.033
When he was inside of me,

21:07.066 --> 21:09.001
I saw this flash of light,
and I--

21:09.035 --> 21:11.304
- Hold on. Hold on.
A flash of light?

21:11.338 --> 21:14.374
- Yeah, I-I don't--
I have no idea what it was.

21:16.075 --> 21:18.611
My--my therapist thinks
that it was my brain

21:18.645 --> 21:20.613
reacting to the trauma.

21:20.647 --> 21:21.948
[knocking]

21:21.981 --> 21:23.015
- Sorry to interrupt,
Lieutenant,

21:23.049 --> 21:24.384
but we got the search warrants.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.719
- Great. Thank you.

21:28.755 --> 21:30.657
- Please be respectful
of the surroundings--

21:30.690 --> 21:31.724
the furniture, the artwork.

21:31.758 --> 21:34.093
- Of course.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.695
- Yeah.

21:35.728 --> 21:37.464
Looks just like the apartment
I grew up in.

21:37.497 --> 21:38.931
- Uh-huh.

21:38.965 --> 21:40.967
No security cameras.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.769
Not in here, anyway.

21:48.808 --> 21:51.043
- Now, this really reminds me
of the apartment I grew up in.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.413
I had a roof terrace
just like that.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.881
- Wow.

21:59.486 --> 22:01.388
- Mind if I kill the lights?

22:01.421 --> 22:02.722
- Yeah. Go for it.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.709
Fin! Come back inside.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.513
A flash of light.

22:26.546 --> 22:31.083
That wasn't Zoe trying
to process her trauma.

22:31.117 --> 22:33.686
- There's a fire stairwell
that leads up to the roof.

22:33.720 --> 22:35.855
A service elevator too.

22:35.888 --> 22:38.124
- Do Eli's guests have access
to this elevator?

22:38.157 --> 22:40.126
- Some of the more
high-profile ones.

22:40.159 --> 22:42.061
Celebrities.
Things like that.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.396
They come in the back entrance

22:43.430 --> 22:44.931
and go up
on the service elevator.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.433
More--more privacy.

22:46.466 --> 22:47.834
- Well, Eli threw a party here
three nights ago.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.936
Did anyone...
use that entrance then?

22:49.969 --> 22:52.705
- Mr. Colton is
a very private person, and--

22:52.739 --> 22:54.941
- That's not the question.

22:54.974 --> 22:58.445
- We can take this down
to the station if you'd prefer.

22:58.478 --> 23:01.013
- [sighs]
No need for any of that.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.450
- So?

23:03.483 --> 23:05.852
- Yeah. Some guy rode up
the elevator that night.

23:05.885 --> 23:06.919
- All right.
You know his name?

23:06.953 --> 23:08.421
- No.

23:09.489 --> 23:11.123
- He sign in?
- Nope.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.560
Eli tells me to just let 'em up.

23:13.593 --> 23:16.162
- Does this elevator have
a camera in it?

23:16.195 --> 23:17.764
- Mm-hmm.

23:20.199 --> 23:21.968
- Guy comes up at 2:45 a.m.,

23:22.001 --> 23:23.470
right around the time
Zoe was raped,

23:23.503 --> 23:25.538
and then he comes back down
five minutes later.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.073
- And we got a hit
on facial recognition.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.741
The guy's name is Harry Ingram.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.443
He's got one prior,
cocaine possession

23:30.477 --> 23:31.778
with intent to distribute.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.480
Now, I talked to my friend
in Narcotics.

23:33.513 --> 23:35.448
He says this guy Ingram
is a well-known dealer

23:35.482 --> 23:37.016
to the Wall Street crowd.

23:37.049 --> 23:39.018
- Okay, so Harry shows up
to sell Eli some coke.

23:39.051 --> 23:41.087
He takes
the service elevator up,

23:41.120 --> 23:44.123
and then he opens up
Eli's terrace door--

23:44.156 --> 23:46.025
- Creating the flash of light
in the dark room.

23:46.058 --> 23:48.928
- He sees what's going on,
gets the hell out of there.

23:48.961 --> 23:50.162
- So what do we do,
bring him in?

23:50.196 --> 23:53.866
- No. He has no reason
to cooperate with us.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.034
Not yet, anyway.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.038
You know anything
about the stock market?

24:02.509 --> 24:03.476
- Can I help you?

24:03.510 --> 24:04.544
- Hey. Harry.

24:04.577 --> 24:05.912
It's, uh, Stuart Gleacher.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.881
I called you
and left a message.

24:08.915 --> 24:11.050
Anyway, I-I used to work
with Eli Colton.

24:11.083 --> 24:13.886
In fact, I-I think
I met you a few times at, uh,

24:13.920 --> 24:15.522
at his place in--in Tribeca,

24:15.555 --> 24:17.524
one of those rooftop parties
he had last fall?

24:17.557 --> 24:19.859
Think we rode that
private elevator up together?

24:19.892 --> 24:21.193
- What can I do for you, Stuart?

24:21.227 --> 24:22.194
- Um...

24:22.228 --> 24:24.997
Did, uh, Eli--he didn't--
he didn't call you?

24:25.031 --> 24:26.198
- No.

24:26.232 --> 24:28.568
- Okay. Uh, I'm sorry.

24:28.601 --> 24:30.036
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna track him down.

24:30.069 --> 24:31.838
I'm gonna get him to call you.

24:31.871 --> 24:33.840
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pop
up out of the blue like that.

24:33.873 --> 24:35.274
You know, that--that's my bad.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.510
- Uh, it's--it's cool, bro.
Come on in.

24:37.544 --> 24:39.211
- Thank you.

24:44.283 --> 24:47.019
- So, uh, you and Eli
are--are buddies?

24:47.053 --> 24:48.220
- Yeah,
we used to work together,

24:48.254 --> 24:49.656
among other things.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.524
- What, uh,
what can I do for you?

24:51.558 --> 24:54.093
- I'm, uh,
I'm looking to get a big eight.

24:54.126 --> 24:55.895
- Say, where do you--
where do you work now?

24:55.928 --> 24:57.296
- Hedge fund called Panther.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.532
- Oh. What kind of--
what kind of fund?

24:59.566 --> 25:02.869
- You know, it's, uh,
it's long-short, it's low beta,

25:02.902 --> 25:04.236
It's real quant shop, you know?

25:04.270 --> 25:06.072
I'm on the sales side now,
though, why?

25:06.105 --> 25:07.540
You looking for an internship
or something?

25:07.574 --> 25:11.110
- No, no, I'm--I'm
more of an entrepreneur.

25:11.143 --> 25:13.880
I--actually,
I got this-this one idea.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.147
- I like
the business you're in now.

25:15.181 --> 25:16.883
You got endless demand,
high margins.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.618
- Yeah, but
the--the risk is too high.

25:18.651 --> 25:22.188
Anyway, check it out.
I was in China a few months ago.

25:22.221 --> 25:23.422
There's fast food chains
everywhere,

25:23.455 --> 25:29.596
so invest in Chinese weight loss
gyms, diet pills, all of that.

25:29.629 --> 25:31.163
Make a killing.

25:39.305 --> 25:41.007
- How much is that?
Three grand?

25:41.040 --> 25:43.009
- Four.
- What?

25:43.042 --> 25:45.144
- Supply and demand, bro.

25:45.177 --> 25:46.946
- Of course.

25:48.715 --> 25:50.016
You know what, Harry?

25:50.049 --> 25:52.018
It's been a real, real pleasure

25:52.051 --> 25:53.185
doing business with you.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.654
- Sure, sure.

25:56.656 --> 25:58.157
- Hey!

25:58.190 --> 25:59.158
Get down on your knees.

25:59.191 --> 26:01.160
Hands on your head.

26:01.193 --> 26:02.161
Harry Ingram.

26:02.194 --> 26:03.663
You're under arrest

26:03.696 --> 26:05.598
for possession of a class-A drug

26:05.632 --> 26:07.233
with intent to distribute.

26:07.266 --> 26:10.036
- Hey, guys, check the oven.

26:10.069 --> 26:11.137
I'm sorry, bro.

26:18.044 --> 26:18.878
- Eight ounces,
that's a lot of weight.

26:20.780 --> 26:22.649
I mean, one prior,
plus this.

26:22.682 --> 26:25.885
You are staring down
a lot of time.

26:25.918 --> 26:28.721
Unless you might want
to help us.

26:28.755 --> 26:30.056
- What the hell is this?
- This?

26:30.089 --> 26:31.924
That's a video of you
on your way up to a party

26:31.958 --> 26:34.761
at Eli Colton's penthouse
four nights ago.

26:34.794 --> 26:36.729
A party which you spent
exactly five minutes at.

26:36.763 --> 26:38.798
Now, you mind telling me
what happened that night?

26:38.831 --> 26:40.867
- I-I went up
to hang out at Eli's,

26:40.900 --> 26:42.802
I took the service elevator up,

26:42.835 --> 26:48.007
and...when I opened
the master bedroom door...

26:48.040 --> 26:50.042
I'm guessing
you want to know what I saw?

26:50.076 --> 26:51.944
- You're a genius.

26:51.978 --> 26:54.781
- Well... I'm happy to share,

26:54.814 --> 26:58.918
but I'm--I'm gonna need
certain assurances.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.419
- Well,
we're not in the business

27:00.452 --> 27:04.323
of making assurances, but...

27:04.356 --> 27:06.325
you know what,
if you tell us the truth,

27:06.358 --> 27:07.760
we can put in
a good word for you

27:07.794 --> 27:08.895
at the DA's office.

27:08.928 --> 27:11.297
- Tell us what happened, Harry.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.431
Come on.

27:12.464 --> 27:13.733
Because if you don't,

27:13.766 --> 27:15.401
this is gonna end badly for you.

27:15.434 --> 27:17.770
- [sighs]

27:17.804 --> 27:21.073
When I opened the door,
Eli was on top of this girl,

27:21.107 --> 27:23.810
and she was struggling.

27:23.843 --> 27:28.447
I-I heard her say,
"Stop. Get off me,"

27:28.480 --> 27:29.448
and he didn't.

27:29.481 --> 27:32.785
Ugh. It was--
it was ugly.

27:32.819 --> 27:35.321
I-I shut the door,
and I got the hell out of there.

27:35.354 --> 27:36.956
Look, I'm no saint,
but I am...

27:36.989 --> 27:40.927
definitely not okay
with that kind of thing.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.461
- Okay, so,

27:42.494 --> 27:45.031
Eli's self-interested
coke dealer witnessed the rape.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.033
- Okay, so he's not
a perfect witness.

27:47.066 --> 27:48.034
- Even if he's telling
the truth,

27:48.067 --> 27:49.168
he's practically useless.

27:49.201 --> 27:51.804
- So...let's use him
outside the courtroom

27:51.838 --> 27:52.972
to gather more evidence.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.741
- You think
he's willing to wear a wire?

27:54.774 --> 27:56.976
- I think he's willing
to wear a clown suit.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.778
This guy is so afraid
of going to prison,

27:58.811 --> 28:00.880
he'll do anything we want.

28:00.913 --> 28:02.849
- Worth a shot.

28:03.916 --> 28:05.451
- I'm sorry
to bother you with this,

28:05.484 --> 28:06.819
but I am freaking out.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.454
- Well, tell me what's going on.

28:08.487 --> 28:09.455
Maybe I can help you out.

28:09.488 --> 28:12.358
- The police found out
that I was at your place

28:12.391 --> 28:13.893
the other night,
the night of the--

28:13.926 --> 28:15.361
- The night
I had work friends over

28:15.394 --> 28:17.063
for drinks
to celebrate the closing

28:17.096 --> 28:19.799
of the Whitmere Hotel chain
that I had just purchased?

28:19.832 --> 28:23.970
- Yeah, they wanted to know
if I saw anything suspicious.

28:24.003 --> 28:26.505
- Like what?
Drug use, or?

28:26.538 --> 28:29.175
- No, like, something else.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.743
- Well, what did you tell them?

28:30.777 --> 28:32.812
- I told them that I wanted
to talk to a lawyer.

28:32.845 --> 28:34.413
- Well, that was smart.

28:34.446 --> 28:36.783
But the fact is,
nothing suspicious did happen.

28:36.816 --> 28:39.085
- Yeah, right.

28:39.118 --> 28:40.219
- Excuse me?

28:40.252 --> 28:42.488
- Look, I-I was there, Eli.

28:42.521 --> 28:44.023
I saw you on top of that girl.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.992
I-I heard her yell "stop."

28:46.025 --> 28:48.895
- You mean you heard her
yell "don't stop"?

28:48.928 --> 28:50.129
- Eli's pretty good.

28:50.162 --> 28:51.430
- Because I would never
have sex with a woman

28:51.463 --> 28:52.598
without her consent.

28:52.631 --> 28:54.133
- Look, Eli,
I'm not in the mood to dance.

28:54.166 --> 28:56.869
I, uh, I'm in a bind.

28:56.903 --> 28:59.138
I-I owe my buddy in Miami
some cash.

28:59.171 --> 29:00.873
- Need money?

29:00.907 --> 29:02.541
- I need to make a deal.

29:02.574 --> 29:05.244
I keep my mouth shut,
you cut me a check.

29:05.277 --> 29:07.013
- This guy's pretty good too.

29:07.046 --> 29:09.415
- How much do you need?

29:09.448 --> 29:11.884
- 500,000.

29:11.918 --> 29:14.921
- 500,000?

29:14.954 --> 29:17.824
Well, I think you need
more than that.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.926
How about a million?

29:19.959 --> 29:24.163
500,000? Well, I think
you need more than that.

29:24.196 --> 29:26.799
How about a million?

29:26.833 --> 29:28.567
- He's clearly trying
to buy him off.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.536
I mean, the guy asked
for 500,000,

29:30.569 --> 29:32.471
and he counters with a million?

29:32.504 --> 29:34.173
The jury's gonna see
right through that.

29:34.206 --> 29:36.242
- I'm not so sure.
Eli's too smooth.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.376
He never took the bait.

29:37.409 --> 29:40.579
Every time Harry pressed him,
he denied any culpability.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.081
- What are you saying,
that you don't want to use it?

29:42.114 --> 29:43.282
- We can play this audio
for a jury

29:43.315 --> 29:45.184
and let them decide
if Eli's lying,

29:45.217 --> 29:47.153
but we need something
more definitive.

29:47.186 --> 29:49.055
- Like what?

29:49.088 --> 29:50.923
- Like Eli's banker,
Roger Littrell.

29:50.957 --> 29:52.291
- We tried.

29:52.324 --> 29:53.292
He won't cooperate.

29:53.325 --> 29:54.894
Eli is his golden goose.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.929
That guy is not talking.

29:56.963 --> 29:59.165
- Not without
the proper motivation, anyway.

29:59.198 --> 30:01.300
These guys are all motivated
by one thing.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.501
- Money.

30:06.505 --> 30:07.974
Mr. Hewitt.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.508
- How can I assist you,
Lieutenant?

30:09.541 --> 30:11.911
- Actually,
I'm here to assist you.

30:11.944 --> 30:15.047
- In what way?
- By giving you a tip.

30:15.081 --> 30:18.050
You know, as you guys like
to say, inside information.

30:18.084 --> 30:19.618
- My firm is far too reputable

30:19.651 --> 30:21.888
to engage
in that kind of activity.

30:21.921 --> 30:23.622
- Right. Well, later on today,

30:23.655 --> 30:25.524
we're going to be arresting
your friend

30:25.557 --> 30:27.159
and your client, Eli Colton,

30:27.193 --> 30:29.996
for raping your associate,
Zoe White.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.532
- I thought
you were here to help.

30:33.565 --> 30:36.102
- Oh, I am.
- How?

30:36.135 --> 30:37.203
- By giving you a chance

30:37.236 --> 30:39.972
to get on the right
side of history.

30:40.006 --> 30:43.209
You see, Eli's name
is going to be everywhere--

30:43.242 --> 30:46.145
all over the news,
in newspapers, tabloids--

30:46.178 --> 30:49.015
which means that...
Cromwell Moore's name

30:49.048 --> 30:50.983
is going to be splattered
everywhere.

30:51.017 --> 30:52.919
So the question is,

30:52.952 --> 30:55.187
how do you want
to be characterized?

30:55.221 --> 30:57.924
As a hero or a villain?

31:00.292 --> 31:01.961
- Tell me what you need.

31:01.994 --> 31:05.264
Please.

31:05.297 --> 31:06.865
- Roger Littrell.

31:08.300 --> 31:10.903
His testimony's crucial.

31:12.671 --> 31:15.674
- He owes his whole career
to Eli.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.609
Without him,
Roger's just another guy

31:17.643 --> 31:20.279
in an expensive suit
pulling down 2 mil a year.

31:20.312 --> 31:22.314
He'll never flip.

31:22.348 --> 31:23.549
But we don't need him.

31:23.582 --> 31:26.385
- Excuse me?

31:26.418 --> 31:29.288
- Every conversation
in our office is recorded.

31:29.321 --> 31:31.157
Brutal honesty
is the cornerstone

31:31.190 --> 31:34.293
of our firm's philosophy.

31:34.326 --> 31:35.694
I'll have the relevant videos

31:35.727 --> 31:39.698
sent to your office
within the hour.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.301
Nice doing business with you.

31:42.334 --> 31:44.170
- And you.

31:46.438 --> 31:48.107
What's gonna happen to Roger?

31:48.140 --> 31:51.277
- He'll be out of the office
before the end of the day.

31:55.314 --> 31:57.116
- Conference call was cancelled
for Friday,

31:57.149 --> 31:58.617
but the meeting for Monday--
- Eli Colton!

32:00.252 --> 32:03.189
You're under arrest
for first-degree rape.

32:03.222 --> 32:06.058
- Is this absolutely necessary?
- Yeah. It is.

32:06.092 --> 32:08.995
We find that arresting,
handcuffing rapists

32:09.028 --> 32:10.362
is an efficient way
to do business,

32:10.396 --> 32:11.730
and don't worry,

32:11.763 --> 32:14.666
this isn't activity
for activity's sake.

32:18.037 --> 32:20.139
- So Eli's under arrest?

32:20.172 --> 32:21.240
It's official?

32:21.273 --> 32:24.410
- Oh, we arrested him last night
of first-degree rape.

32:24.443 --> 32:28.981
It turns out that Cromwell Moore
records everything.

32:29.015 --> 32:32.118
There is footage
of your conversation with Roger

32:32.151 --> 32:33.285
the morning after the assault

32:33.319 --> 32:36.622
and him typing on your computer
later that afternoon.

32:36.655 --> 32:39.258
- So it was Roger who
sent the phony email to Eli.

32:39.291 --> 32:41.127
- Sure looks that way.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.229
- They have cameras
in our office?

32:43.262 --> 32:44.330
That's really creepy.

32:44.363 --> 32:45.697
- It certainly is,

32:45.731 --> 32:47.699
but it gave us
the evidence that we need

32:47.733 --> 32:48.700
to move forward.

32:48.734 --> 32:50.236
- So what's next?

32:50.269 --> 32:53.272
- We indict Eli,
and he goes to trial.

32:53.305 --> 32:55.141
- Which means I have to testify.

32:55.174 --> 32:56.408
- Yes.

32:58.810 --> 33:01.113
Zoe, what's going on?

33:01.147 --> 33:02.348
I thought
this was what you wanted.

33:02.381 --> 33:03.682
- No, I-I do.
I do.

33:03.715 --> 33:06.385
It's just that it's...

33:06.418 --> 33:07.653
it's complicated.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.088
- How so?

33:10.356 --> 33:12.291
- I met with
the head of the M&A group

33:12.324 --> 33:14.126
at Cromwell the other night,

33:14.160 --> 33:16.662
and he suggested
that I transfer to Brussels,

33:16.695 --> 33:18.397
that it would be good
for my career.

33:18.430 --> 33:21.033
- They're retaliating.
- I know, but...

33:21.067 --> 33:23.435
I was offered a very lucrative
position at another firm.

33:23.469 --> 33:24.770
Sullivan Davis.

33:24.803 --> 33:26.505
- What does that have to do
with this?

33:26.538 --> 33:29.308
- One of the conditions
is that I keep a low profile.

33:32.744 --> 33:34.446
- They don't want you
to testify.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.351
Because of Eli.

33:41.187 --> 33:45.491
So this job offer...

33:45.524 --> 33:47.393
is a payoff,
is that what you're saying?

33:47.426 --> 33:49.361
- Call it whatever you want,

33:49.395 --> 33:50.829
but it's a really good deal.

33:50.862 --> 33:55.734
They're gonna pay me $5 million
a year for four years.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.403
I can't say no to that.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.338
- Zoe, listen to me.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.140
- No. Hold on a second.

34:01.173 --> 34:03.175
I did everything right--

34:03.209 --> 34:05.277
I came forward,
I told the truth,

34:05.311 --> 34:08.447
I even took on Eli Colton--
and where did it get me?

34:08.480 --> 34:09.848
What happened?

34:09.881 --> 34:12.284
They almost decimated my career.

34:12.318 --> 34:13.519
My future.

34:15.287 --> 34:19.191
- Zoe, I know that this is hard.

34:19.225 --> 34:20.792
- The thing is
is that it's always

34:20.826 --> 34:21.860
going to be hard.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.795
Whether or not
I testify against Eli,

34:23.829 --> 34:26.332
whether or not
he goes to prison,

34:26.365 --> 34:29.168
the pain and everything
that I just endured

34:29.201 --> 34:31.737
is never gonna disappear.

34:31.770 --> 34:34.473
So I have two options.

34:34.506 --> 34:36.575
I can either be a poor
and careerless victim,

34:36.608 --> 34:40.212
or I can be a wealthy,
employed victim.

34:40.246 --> 34:43.182
That's it.

34:59.365 --> 34:59.465
.

34:59.498 --> 35:00.299
- After all this,
Zoe wants to go paws up

35:01.267 --> 35:02.234
and let this guy walk?

35:02.268 --> 35:03.369
- Look, she wants to get paid.

35:03.402 --> 35:04.536
- I get it,
but ain't nothing for free.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.405
- Check this out.

35:08.407 --> 35:09.641
- Two rich white men
having dinner.

35:09.675 --> 35:10.776
That's not exactly newsworthy.

35:10.809 --> 35:12.511
- That is Eli and David Potter,

35:12.544 --> 35:14.246
CEO of Sullivan Davis.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.881
- That's the company
that just made Zoe

35:15.914 --> 35:17.416
that ridiculous job offer.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.251
- Now, legally,
this doesn't prove anything.

35:19.285 --> 35:21.587
- No, but it does confirm
what we suspect.

35:21.620 --> 35:23.622
Eli cut a deal
to run his business

35:23.655 --> 35:25.491
through Sullivan, and in return,

35:25.524 --> 35:28.427
Sullivan funnels
some of that revenue to Zoe.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.761
- Yeah, to keep her quiet.

35:29.795 --> 35:30.896
- Gotta love Wall Street.

35:30.929 --> 35:32.331
- This is a payoff.
It's a bribe.

35:32.364 --> 35:33.632
We can't just let them get away.

35:33.665 --> 35:36.435
- I'll keep Barba,
see what our options are.

35:38.837 --> 35:40.672
- Two businessmen having dinner
doesn't prove a damn thing.

35:40.706 --> 35:42.408
- For ten years...

35:42.441 --> 35:44.743
Eli's only bank
is Cromwell Moore,

35:44.776 --> 35:46.545
and then right before
he's about to go on trial

35:46.578 --> 35:47.713
on a rape charge,

35:47.746 --> 35:51.450
some firm, out of the blue,
offers a 26-year-old kid,

35:51.483 --> 35:54.420
who makes 300 grand a year,
$5 million.

35:54.453 --> 35:55.421
Are you kidding me?

35:55.454 --> 35:57.323
- I know, but we can't prove it.

35:57.356 --> 35:59.325
The paper trail is clean.

35:59.358 --> 36:01.793
From the outside, Sullivan Davis
offered Zoe White,

36:01.827 --> 36:05.297
a talented young banker
with impeccable credentials,

36:05.331 --> 36:06.432
a lucrative contract.

36:06.465 --> 36:07.599
There's nothing incriminating
about it.

36:07.633 --> 36:09.735
- Okay. But rape
is still illegal, right?

36:09.768 --> 36:11.570
- Liv.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.305
- So we'll call her
as a hostile witness.

36:13.339 --> 36:15.441
- We can do that,
and we can look like fools.

36:15.474 --> 36:16.642
- I know. I know.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.544
- I know that
this is hard to accept,

36:18.577 --> 36:19.645
but it is her life.

36:19.678 --> 36:20.912
Her decision.

36:22.381 --> 36:24.683
- She's not making a decision.

36:24.716 --> 36:26.852
The girl is being extorted!

36:26.885 --> 36:29.855
- Does he feel that way?

36:29.888 --> 36:35.461
Maybe this job, this money,
will help her heal,

36:35.494 --> 36:37.363
will give her closure.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.934
- I don't believe that
for a second.

36:44.703 --> 36:46.772
And neither do you.

36:46.805 --> 36:48.640
- Of course not.

36:49.908 --> 36:52.511
So let's go find another way
to bury this prick.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.715
- I respect your passion,
Lieutenant,

36:56.748 --> 36:58.450
but you need to respect
my decision.

36:58.484 --> 37:01.353
- I do respect
your decision, Zoe.

37:01.387 --> 37:05.757
And I've been doing this
for a very long time,

37:05.791 --> 37:09.561
and testifying can be
a crucial part

37:09.595 --> 37:11.363
of the healing process.

37:11.397 --> 37:13.932
- I'm sure it is.
For some people.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.667
But I am a deal maker.

37:15.701 --> 37:18.670
I make decisions based
on fact, not feeling.

37:18.704 --> 37:21.006
I analyze the pros, the cons,
the opportunity costs.

37:21.039 --> 37:23.542
- I get it.
I get it.

37:23.575 --> 37:26.412
So using your leverage
against Eli

37:26.445 --> 37:30.749
to extract a premium deal
makes you feel like a winner,

37:30.782 --> 37:32.484
not a loser.

37:32.518 --> 37:33.619
And bankers are different.

37:33.652 --> 37:38.524
You think differently,
and you may heal differently,

37:38.557 --> 37:41.860
but a payoff...

37:41.893 --> 37:45.397
money for silence...

37:45.431 --> 37:47.599
never healed anyone.

37:47.633 --> 37:49.435
- Okay. Let me be clear.

37:49.468 --> 37:52.037
I do not want to
give Eli a pass.

37:52.070 --> 37:53.972
I would love to see
that pig go to prison

37:54.005 --> 37:56.942
and get everything
that he deserves.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.910
But like I said,
I'm a pragmatist,

37:58.944 --> 38:00.946
and right now, based on all
the data and information

38:00.979 --> 38:03.815
that I have right in front of me
in this moment,

38:03.849 --> 38:05.417
this is the best decision.

38:05.451 --> 38:08.887
- If you take the money, Zoe,
Eli wins.

38:08.920 --> 38:11.557
He avoids prison.

38:11.590 --> 38:13.559
And he victimizes you
all over again,

38:13.592 --> 38:16.562
and...he steals your dignity

38:16.595 --> 38:17.996
one last time.

38:21.767 --> 38:25.637
But maybe I'm not
the best person

38:25.671 --> 38:27.072
to talk to you about this.

38:27.105 --> 38:28.474
- Excuse me?

38:31.009 --> 38:33.579
- Come on in, Kate.

38:33.612 --> 38:36.448
Zoe, this is Kate.

38:36.482 --> 38:38.750
She used to work
at Cromwell Moore.

38:48.760 --> 38:50.929
- When it was clear to me
that he wanted to have sex,

38:50.962 --> 38:52.097
I said no.

38:52.130 --> 38:53.565
- And what happened?

38:53.599 --> 38:56.702
- He pulled down my underwear.

38:56.735 --> 39:00.038
I tried to pull away,
but he held me down.

39:00.071 --> 39:02.508
I screamed that I didn't want to
have anything to do with this,

39:02.541 --> 39:03.709
but he didn't care.

39:03.742 --> 39:06.745
He wasn't listening.

39:06.778 --> 39:08.980
And then he put his penis
inside of me.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.749
- Do you see that man
here today?

39:10.782 --> 39:13.519
- Yes.

39:13.552 --> 39:15.621
He's right there.

39:15.654 --> 39:19.691
- Your Honor, I'd like to
present People's Exhibit G.

39:19.725 --> 39:21.693
This is surveillance footage

39:21.727 --> 39:24.596
from Cromwell Moore,
time-stamped 9:12 a.m.,

39:24.630 --> 39:27.633
the day after the assault.

39:27.666 --> 39:29.501
- I-I even was clear
that I didn't want

39:29.535 --> 39:30.936
to have sex with him--
I told him that.

39:30.969 --> 39:34.640
- Well, I'm shocked that Eli
would do something like that.

39:34.673 --> 39:35.874
- What do you mean?

39:35.907 --> 39:37.108
Do you think
I'm making this up?

39:37.142 --> 39:39.044
I'm not--
I'm telling you the truth.

39:39.077 --> 39:42.814
Roger...I told him no,

39:42.848 --> 39:45.817
and I tried to leave,
and he pinned me down.

39:48.720 --> 39:53.091
Eli r--
he raped me.

39:58.964 --> 40:00.666
- Just to confirm, Zoe,

40:00.699 --> 40:02.801
that is you talking to
your supervisor, Roger Littrell,

40:02.834 --> 40:04.169
the morning after the party

40:04.202 --> 40:06.538
where the defendant
sexually assaulted you?

40:06.572 --> 40:07.706
- Yes.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.875
- People's Exhibit H.

40:09.908 --> 40:12.644
That's a letter from
Sullivan Davis to Zoe White,

40:12.678 --> 40:17.082
offering her a job
two days prior

40:17.115 --> 40:20.085
to the arrest of the defendant
for first-degree rape.

40:20.118 --> 40:22.954
Could you please read
the paragraph

40:22.988 --> 40:24.656
under the heading
"compensation," please?

40:24.690 --> 40:26.892
- "Ms. White, hereafter
referred to as 'employee,'

40:26.925 --> 40:28.960
"will receive
a minimum cash compensation

40:28.994 --> 40:31.997
"of $5 million per year
for four years

40:32.030 --> 40:33.699
"plus a discretionary bonus

40:33.732 --> 40:36.201
based on the firm's
overall financial performance."

40:36.234 --> 40:37.969
- Thank you.

40:38.003 --> 40:39.204
Did you accept this job offer?

40:39.237 --> 40:40.205
- No.

40:40.238 --> 40:42.107
- Why not?

40:42.140 --> 40:43.709
- Because it was clear to me
the only reason

40:43.742 --> 40:44.843
why they offered me
so much money

40:44.876 --> 40:47.112
was to ingratiate themselves
to Eli.

40:47.145 --> 40:48.614
- Could you elaborate?

40:49.781 --> 40:51.116
- One of the conditions
of my employment

40:51.149 --> 40:52.984
was that I keep
a low profile.

40:53.018 --> 40:56.988
- So you turned down $20 million

40:57.022 --> 40:59.891
in guaranteed compensation,

40:59.925 --> 41:02.861
just for the opportunity
to testify here today?

41:02.894 --> 41:05.631
- Yes, I did.

41:05.664 --> 41:06.798
- Why?

41:17.776 --> 41:19.778
- Because I didn't want him
to steal my dignity

41:19.811 --> 41:22.047
one more time.

41:27.052 --> 41:28.654
- Nothing further.
