<i>Previously on</i> Switched at Birth...

00:02.263 --> 00:03.662
There's nothing left for me to liquidate.

00:03.697 --> 00:04.963
That pretty much taps me out.

00:05.299 --> 00:06.682
Why didn't you talk to me?

00:06.734 --> 00:10.486
Kathryn, I am trying to find
a way to make this all work.

00:10.521 --> 00:13.489
I can't wait to hang out
with you guys this weekend.

00:15.693 --> 00:16.942
It was an aneurysm.

00:16.977 --> 00:19.661
He died of an aneurysm.

00:19.697 --> 00:23.582
You handled everything
so well after Angelo died.

00:23.617 --> 00:25.501
Regina: So you just walked
away from your whole life?

00:25.536 --> 00:28.787
- Made up new names?
- I did what I had to do to protect my son.

00:28.789 --> 00:30.622
And I'd do it again in a second.

00:30.658 --> 00:32.674
- I'll keep your secret.
- Are you sure?

00:32.710 --> 00:33.759
Mm-hmm.

00:33.794 --> 00:34.927
I think we should move in together.

00:34.962 --> 00:36.962
Now that you know everything
there is to know about me,

00:37.014 --> 00:38.630
we can really become a family.

00:38.682 --> 00:40.966
Let's look at that apartment tomorrow.

Call 9-1-1.

00:54.648 --> 00:55.981
Tell them we have multiple injuries.

00:56.033 --> 00:58.700
Everyone, listen up! Hello?

00:58.736 --> 01:01.954
Anyone who can hear me or
understand me, and can walk,

01:01.989 --> 01:04.540
please move to that table over there

01:04.575 --> 01:05.707
as quickly as you can.

01:05.743 --> 01:07.793
If you're not injured, come with me.

01:12.583 --> 01:13.749
Hey.

01:13.801 --> 01:16.752
Use your jacket to press down

01:16.804 --> 01:19.505
- on his leg and stop the bleeding.
- Mm-hmm.

01:19.557 --> 01:20.973
Okay...

01:24.728 --> 01:26.812
- Hi.
- I can't move my legs.

01:26.847 --> 01:27.980
Can you breathe okay?

01:28.015 --> 01:30.766
- Yes, but I can't... (Grunts)
- Just keep breathing normally.

01:30.818 --> 01:32.851
Help is coming. Will you stay with him?

01:39.660 --> 01:41.994
Hello. Hi. Hello. Can you move?

01:42.029 --> 01:44.613
What's your name?

01:44.665 --> 01:46.832
Can you squeeze my hand?

01:46.867 --> 01:47.866
Good job.

01:47.868 --> 01:49.918
You might have a head injury,

01:49.954 --> 01:52.538
- so stay right here, okay?
- (Groans)

01:54.708 --> 01:55.958
(Whistle blows)

01:56.010 --> 01:58.877
- (Cheering, clapping)
- Good job.

02:26.774 --> 02:28.707
Hey, how's Spanish class going?

02:28.742 --> 02:31.577
Uh, <i>excelente, muy bueno,</i> and...

02:31.629 --> 02:34.913
Other Spanish words
meaning "I'm kicking ass."

02:34.965 --> 02:37.883
That's great. It's in your genes.

02:37.918 --> 02:41.553
Well actually, it's in Regina's tutoring.

02:41.589 --> 02:43.755
It is so awesome having her right

02:43.807 --> 02:45.674
across the driveway to practice.

02:45.726 --> 02:46.842
I'm constantly darting back and forth.

02:46.894 --> 02:48.644
"How do you say this?"
"How do you say that?"

02:48.679 --> 02:50.762
I guess you guys can
meet at the Cracked Mug

02:50.814 --> 02:52.764
- when she moves out.
- Whoa... huh?

02:52.766 --> 02:53.982
Moves out?

02:54.018 --> 02:57.536
Yeah. She's getting a
place with Eric and Will.

02:57.571 --> 02:58.654
She didn't tell you?

02:58.689 --> 02:59.938
No.

02:59.940 --> 03:02.774
Isn't it a little...

03:02.810 --> 03:04.776
I don't know, soon?

03:04.828 --> 03:06.662
They've been dating a while now.

03:06.697 --> 03:09.915
But it hasn't even been
a year since Angelo died.

03:09.950 --> 03:11.917
She can't mourn him forever.

03:11.952 --> 03:13.452
She has to move on.

03:13.504 --> 03:14.620
Move on. Yeah.

03:14.622 --> 03:15.954
But move out?

03:15.956 --> 03:17.623
She just moved in.

03:18.676 --> 03:20.509
It's been three years.

03:21.629 --> 03:22.961
Doesn't seem like it.

03:22.963 --> 03:25.464
Look, don't stress.

03:25.516 --> 03:28.550
It's happening, but it's not
like it's happening today.

03:29.720 --> 03:31.553
Right.

03:31.605 --> 03:32.638
I have to go.

03:44.100 --> 03:49.100
- synced and corrected by chamallow -
- www.addic7ed.com -

04:55.723 --> 04:57.806
- Found ya!
- Hey!

04:57.858 --> 05:01.476
Oh, this is my boyfriend, Mingo.

05:01.528 --> 05:02.778
Mingo, this is Melody.

05:04.481 --> 05:05.814
Nice to meet you!

05:12.906 --> 05:15.574
We're going to South Padre Island,

05:15.576 --> 05:16.875
but not for five more days.

05:16.910 --> 05:18.910
My brain is already there.

05:20.914 --> 05:23.799
"Have a great trip."

05:28.205 --> 05:28.920
You too!

05:33.677 --> 05:35.894
So, our hotel just confirmed

05:35.929 --> 05:37.813
our room faces the water.

05:37.848 --> 05:39.765
I can't wait!

05:39.767 --> 05:41.900
- A whole week with no studying,
- Mm-hmm.

05:41.935 --> 05:43.568
- No classes...
- Mm-hmm.

05:43.604 --> 05:44.936
That's right. No books,

05:44.938 --> 05:47.906
- no laptop...
- No argument here.

05:47.941 --> 05:49.975
Regina: I'm sorry.

05:50.010 --> 05:52.527
I didn't mean for it to be a secret.

05:52.579 --> 05:55.680
We were just waiting for the
right time to announce it.

05:55.716 --> 05:57.666
- Well, congratulations.
- (Sighs)

05:57.701 --> 05:59.534
Hey!

05:59.586 --> 06:00.752
Hi!

06:00.788 --> 06:02.788
I didn't realize you were here.

06:04.458 --> 06:06.875
- Eric offered to fix my wobbly ceiling fan.
- Mm-hmm.

06:08.462 --> 06:09.761
I gotta head back.

06:09.797 --> 06:10.879
- Okay.
- All right.

06:12.666 --> 06:15.634
- Nice to see you, Bay.
- You too.

06:16.854 --> 06:18.887
- Hmm.
- Um...

06:18.939 --> 06:21.473
So, I wanted to run something by you.

06:21.525 --> 06:22.641
Shoot.

06:22.643 --> 06:23.942
All right. Well...

06:23.977 --> 06:25.894
J and K have been riding me

06:25.946 --> 06:27.612
about getting a job so I can pay

06:27.648 --> 06:29.481
for the Frida Kahlo program if I get in.

06:29.533 --> 06:30.649
And I was thinking,

06:30.651 --> 06:32.818
what I came and worked
for you at the Cracked Mug?

06:32.870 --> 06:34.486
Huh.

06:34.538 --> 06:37.572
We have been talking
about hiring a new barista

06:37.624 --> 06:38.824
now that we're busier.

06:38.826 --> 06:41.877
You should bring in a résumé.

06:41.912 --> 06:44.963
Résumé. Right.

06:44.998 --> 06:46.715
We'd have to interview you.

06:46.750 --> 06:48.834
I can't look like I'm playing favorites.

06:48.836 --> 06:50.669
Oh, of course not. Nepotism bad.

06:50.671 --> 06:53.872
Actually, we can do it
right now if you want.

06:53.907 --> 06:55.640
Okay.

06:55.676 --> 06:56.975
Have a seat.

07:00.814 --> 07:02.898
Now, can you tell me the difference

07:02.933 --> 07:05.650
between regular coffee
and decaffeinated coffee?

07:06.854 --> 07:08.820
Regular coffee has caffeine?

07:11.692 --> 07:15.527
Oh, you totally had me.

07:15.579 --> 07:17.913
Come in this afternoon
and we'll get you started.

07:17.948 --> 07:20.448
Nepotism yay!

07:23.670 --> 07:25.871
Aw, thanks for bringing this, sweetie.

07:25.923 --> 07:27.539
You know, I didn't want to leave

07:27.541 --> 07:29.708
the guys alone in case they needed backup.

07:29.760 --> 07:32.711
Oh. Well, there's hardly
any cars out there, sweetie.

07:32.763 --> 07:34.796
And then the line is down the street.

07:36.884 --> 07:38.550
You know, I was thinking,

07:38.552 --> 07:41.720
um... maybe I should get a job.

07:41.722 --> 07:42.804
You've got a job.

07:42.856 --> 07:44.639
No. I mean an office job.

07:44.691 --> 07:45.891
The kids are older now,

07:45.943 --> 07:48.777
and I think it would
be a good change for me.

07:50.731 --> 07:52.564
And I was thinking maybe...

07:52.566 --> 07:55.533
We should make a more significant change?

07:55.569 --> 07:56.902
What kind of change?

07:56.954 --> 07:58.787
Um...

07:58.822 --> 08:01.489
Like selling the car washes.

08:03.577 --> 08:05.627
Kathryn, you don't just go out

08:05.662 --> 08:07.662
and sell the goose that
lays the golden eggs.

08:07.714 --> 08:10.582
I thought Marty said that the eggs...

08:10.634 --> 08:12.667
haven't been golden for a long time.

08:12.719 --> 08:16.471
It's an up and down
business, and I just started

08:16.506 --> 08:18.473
this fantastic promotion that I'm sure

08:18.508 --> 08:19.841
is gonna get things humming again.

08:19.893 --> 08:21.676
(Door opens)

08:21.728 --> 08:22.761
Woman: Excuse me.

08:22.813 --> 08:23.812
I don't mean to bother you two,

08:23.847 --> 08:25.931
but I am a huge fan and I'm wondering

08:25.933 --> 08:27.766
if there's any way that
I could get a picture.

08:27.818 --> 08:30.852
- (Clears throat)
- Oh, yeah. Of course.

08:30.904 --> 08:32.770
John loves to meet Royals fans.

08:32.823 --> 08:34.606
- Oh actually, I...
- Oh, go closer.

08:34.658 --> 08:35.907
He doesn't bite.

08:35.943 --> 08:38.576
Kathryn, I believe she'd like
to take a picture with you.

08:38.611 --> 08:39.910
Yes. That's what I meant.

08:39.947 --> 08:42.580
Oh, wow. Oh... oh.

08:42.616 --> 08:43.865
I'll be happy to.

08:43.917 --> 08:46.868
- Here.
- I remember when I use to be the household name.

08:46.920 --> 08:51.790
Okay ladies, let's have
a nice smile, shall we?

08:51.792 --> 08:53.625
And here we go.

08:53.677 --> 08:54.843
Boom. Perfect.

08:54.878 --> 08:56.628
- Thank you.
- Uh-huh.

08:56.680 --> 08:59.497
I have read <i>Batter Up</i> five times.

08:59.533 --> 09:00.465
My husband thanks you

09:00.517 --> 09:02.467
for introducing us to the wagon wheel.

09:02.469 --> 09:04.602
Oh, well it's never too late

09:04.638 --> 09:05.804
to learn some new tricks, right?

09:05.806 --> 09:08.523
Ladies, if you'll excuse me...

09:08.558 --> 09:10.642
- (Sighs)
- I'm sorry to keep you,

09:10.644 --> 09:12.477
but is there gonna be a <i>Batter Up 2?</i>

09:12.479 --> 09:14.896
- Oh, I'm not sure yet.
- Oh. Actually,

09:14.948 --> 09:17.615
I'll buy anything with the
Kathryn Kennish name on it.

09:17.651 --> 09:18.867
Thanks again.

09:18.902 --> 09:20.618
Wow.

09:20.654 --> 09:21.903
You're welcome.

09:26.877 --> 09:28.877
Honey, you're still a household name.

09:28.912 --> 09:30.628
Look, you don't have to...

09:30.664 --> 09:31.830
And now, so am I.

09:31.832 --> 09:34.632
Famous baseball player,
best-selling author...

09:34.668 --> 09:36.835
We're not exactly Derek
Jeter and J.K. Rowling.

09:36.887 --> 09:38.720
So we're not globally famous.

09:38.755 --> 09:41.473
But our names still
mean something to people.

09:41.508 --> 09:43.558
That's our golden goose.

09:43.593 --> 09:44.759
Us!

09:44.811 --> 09:47.512
- What do you mean?
- We could endorse products.

09:47.514 --> 09:49.931
Celebrities do it all the time
and they make good money doing it.

09:49.983 --> 09:52.784
George Foreman's made a
killing off that grill.

09:52.819 --> 09:54.602
We could endorse appliances.

09:54.654 --> 09:56.855
Yeah. Fancy ones like the chefs use.

09:56.907 --> 09:58.857
And we both have great hair!

09:58.909 --> 10:02.610
We could do shampoo,
hair styling products...

10:02.662 --> 10:04.496
Hi-def TVs.

10:04.531 --> 10:06.865
Every household in America has got a TV.

10:06.900 --> 10:08.783
Why didn't we think of this before?

10:08.835 --> 10:10.702
I am gonna talk to my editor

10:10.704 --> 10:12.587
and have them set me up
with some marketing people.

10:12.622 --> 10:13.955
Yes. Good idea!

10:14.007 --> 10:15.757
This is so exciting.

10:15.792 --> 10:17.509
It's gonna be great.

10:21.882 --> 10:24.516
I just wanted to say I'm really excited.

10:24.551 --> 10:25.600
- Put this on.
- Um...

10:25.635 --> 10:26.601
Thank you so much...

10:26.636 --> 10:27.886
Have you ever been on a ride-along before?

10:27.888 --> 10:28.887
No, but I worked

10:28.889 --> 10:30.889
with patients at a free clinic.

10:30.941 --> 10:33.608
- Intake?
- Yeah, mostly. But...

10:33.643 --> 10:35.693
- Yeah, this is different.
- I know.

10:35.729 --> 10:37.946
I did really well on my
disaster training courses,

10:37.981 --> 10:40.648
I know how to C.P.R., and my triage is...

10:40.700 --> 10:41.900
Yeah, you won't be
needing any of that here.

10:41.902 --> 10:43.701
Your job is to stay out
of the way and observe.

10:43.737 --> 10:44.736
- That's all.
- Got it.

10:44.788 --> 10:46.704
But even if you think you can help, don't.

10:46.740 --> 10:48.573
- This is not hands-on.
- Right.

10:48.575 --> 10:49.791
Ask me any question, but not while

10:49.826 --> 10:50.959
I'm treating a patient or on the radio.

10:50.994 --> 10:52.794
Radio: <i>Squad 37.</i>

10:52.829 --> 10:54.963
<i>Incoming ems event, structure fire.</i>

10:54.998 --> 10:57.715
<i>44-hundred block of South Cairo Road.</i>

10:57.751 --> 10:59.584
Squad 37 copy, en route.

10:59.636 --> 11:00.585
<i>- Copy that.</i>
- Hey, we got one!

11:00.637 --> 11:02.637
- We gotta go.
- What? Right now?

11:02.672 --> 11:03.888
- Let's go!
- Okay!

11:05.509 --> 11:06.558
(Engine starts)

11:10.564 --> 11:11.596
(Siren wails)

11:20.726 --> 11:24.728
And the next step is an online interview.

11:24.730 --> 11:29.315
So if you get in, it's
one month in Mexico City?

11:29.368 --> 11:30.734
Right next to <i>La Casa Azul,</i>

11:30.769 --> 11:33.620
the very rooms where
Frida lived and painted.

11:33.655 --> 11:36.289
Oh, I can't even imagine.

11:36.324 --> 11:37.741
Okay. Pop quiz.

11:37.793 --> 11:40.744
What is this color <i>en español?</i>

11:40.746 --> 11:42.412
<i>Amarillo.</i>

11:43.498 --> 11:44.631
<i>Verde.</i>

11:48.503 --> 11:50.353
It's a hard one. Um...

11:50.389 --> 11:51.471
<i>Morado?</i>

11:51.506 --> 11:53.390
<i>Muy bien.</i>

11:53.425 --> 11:54.591
(Phone beeps)

11:54.643 --> 11:55.592
Oh.

11:58.764 --> 12:00.313
(Phone beeps)

12:01.650 --> 12:03.683
Oh god.

12:03.718 --> 12:04.684
What is it?

12:06.488 --> 12:09.522
My phone just reminded me that...

12:09.574 --> 12:12.275
It's Angelo's birthday on Thursday.

12:13.779 --> 12:15.361
Oh.

12:20.702 --> 12:23.286
He always used to tease me.

12:23.338 --> 12:25.622
I never remembered his
birthday even when he was alive.

12:30.462 --> 12:33.329
Do you want to do something that night?

12:33.365 --> 12:36.699
Like have dinner at the
guest house with Daphne?

12:38.687 --> 12:40.720
Yeah. Sure.

12:40.772 --> 12:41.721
(Sniffles)

12:41.773 --> 12:43.473
Eric: Hello, ladies.

12:43.525 --> 12:45.558
Bay, how was your first day?

12:45.610 --> 12:46.693
Great.

12:46.728 --> 12:49.312
Really hit it off with my new boss.

12:49.364 --> 12:50.447
And check it out.

12:54.586 --> 12:55.785
Wow.

12:55.821 --> 12:57.487
It's cool, right?

12:57.489 --> 12:58.705
So we're gonna put this one outside,

12:58.740 --> 13:00.690
and then we have another
board for specials.

13:00.725 --> 13:03.293
I know it's almost closing time,

13:03.328 --> 13:04.694
but I don't mind staying
if you want to work on it.

13:04.729 --> 13:06.663
Eric: Actually, I gotta steal her.

13:06.665 --> 13:07.714
We have an appointment?

13:07.749 --> 13:10.667
Oh! I forgot.

13:10.669 --> 13:13.419
We're looking at condos in Platte City.

13:13.472 --> 13:14.471
Wow.

13:14.506 --> 13:16.673
That's like a suburb of a suburb.

13:16.675 --> 13:18.408
It seems charming.

13:18.443 --> 13:20.426
And the public schools are excellent.

13:20.479 --> 13:22.312
- For Will.
- Right.

13:22.347 --> 13:23.346
Of course.

13:23.398 --> 13:24.564
Okay. I'm ready.

13:24.599 --> 13:25.732
You're gonna be okay by yourself, right?

13:25.767 --> 13:27.684
Oh, yeah. Just me. Got it.

13:27.736 --> 13:29.486
We'll be back to lock up.

13:36.094 --> 13:37.093
So did you hit him back?

13:37.112 --> 13:38.195
Man: Of course she hit me back.

13:38.230 --> 13:40.113
You think I got these
scratches from her kissing me?

13:40.148 --> 13:42.115
Lewis, shut your mouth.
It's not your turn yet.

13:42.150 --> 13:43.316
Woman: You think I'm the type of woman

13:43.368 --> 13:45.235
who's gonna let a scumbag like you

13:45.237 --> 13:47.120
punch me and not punch back?

13:47.155 --> 13:49.322
Val. Steady.

13:49.374 --> 13:51.241
You know, I'm gonna
have to take you both in.

13:54.079 --> 13:55.078
This is terrible.

13:55.130 --> 13:56.296
They are frequent flyers.

13:56.331 --> 13:58.298
- Frequent...
- Regulars.

13:58.333 --> 13:59.966
We see them about once a month.

14:00.002 --> 14:01.301
Payday comes, they get drunk,

14:01.336 --> 14:03.086
knock each other around,
then the cops come.

14:03.138 --> 14:04.254
Cops call us.

14:04.256 --> 14:05.388
Nothing changes.

14:05.424 --> 14:07.173
Let's go.

14:07.226 --> 14:10.143
Lewis, Val, you be nice.

14:16.068 --> 14:18.101
So the rest of the team is going

14:18.103 --> 14:20.186
to Myrtle Beach to party,

14:20.239 --> 14:23.990
and you're going to
Mexico to do charity work?

14:32.589 --> 14:33.667
Why?

14:33.702 --> 14:38.955
Because you skipped class to go
to a football game in California?

14:43.128 --> 14:45.128
Okay, I'll ask.

14:45.180 --> 14:47.130
How's Emmett?

14:53.588 --> 14:55.355
Good. Good.

15:00.145 --> 15:01.978
Did you meet Skye?

15:03.148 --> 15:04.281
You know what?

15:04.316 --> 15:06.399
Nevermind. Um... I don't wanna know.

15:08.387 --> 15:10.954
Okay, I do. I wanna know.

15:13.725 --> 15:14.324
And?

15:14.326 --> 15:16.076
Are they dating now?

15:20.512 --> 15:24.250
If they're together just... tell me.

15:32.244 --> 15:33.310
Wow.

15:37.182 --> 15:38.181
Thanks.

15:45.157 --> 15:47.324
I was thrilled when our Chicago office

15:47.359 --> 15:48.358
called about you two.

15:48.410 --> 15:51.444
Offices in Chicago and New York? Wow.

15:51.496 --> 15:55.448
It's where the big ad agencies and
companies with higher marketing budgets are.

15:55.500 --> 15:57.000
Better for our branding clients.

15:57.035 --> 15:58.251
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

16:00.122 --> 16:03.206
Now, I did some preliminary research

16:03.258 --> 16:06.009
into who your target demographic is, okay?

16:06.044 --> 16:09.095
Knowing that helps us identify
what products you have synergy with.

16:09.131 --> 16:14.284
If I may, I feel as if Kathryn and I
have synergy with high-end products...

16:14.319 --> 16:16.219
you know, luxury automobiles,

16:16.271 --> 16:18.221
fine wines, things like that.

16:22.060 --> 16:24.227
Well, our research shows that you have

16:24.279 --> 16:26.229
the greatest name
recognition with men and women

16:26.281 --> 16:28.098
ages 40 to 65.

16:28.133 --> 16:30.367
- Great.
- And within that group,

16:30.402 --> 16:33.069
we'd go after professionals
with leisure time.

16:33.071 --> 16:34.204
That's your branding target.

16:34.239 --> 16:36.990
So with that in mind,
here are a few products

16:37.042 --> 16:38.408
that we think you would be perfect for.

16:41.163 --> 16:42.245
Turanova.

16:43.415 --> 16:45.382
Prescription drugs are big.

16:45.417 --> 16:47.250
Actually, it's an herbal supplement

16:47.302 --> 16:49.969
still waiting for F.D.A. approval.

16:50.005 --> 16:51.971
Oh. What's it for?

16:52.007 --> 16:54.057
Boosts a woman's libido.

16:54.092 --> 16:57.260
You pop one of these, 30 minutes
later, you are ready to go.

16:57.262 --> 16:59.062
And talk about synergy!

16:59.097 --> 17:00.980
I mean, you're the
reigning queen of Herotica.

17:01.016 --> 17:02.332
It's perfect.

17:02.367 --> 17:04.267
- Maybe.
- Um...

17:04.319 --> 17:06.935
Do you have anything else?

17:06.938 --> 17:09.105
Yeah, yeah, yeah. John, let me ask you,

17:09.156 --> 17:11.141
you ever out on the links,

17:11.175 --> 17:13.108
get the sudden urge to take a whiz,

17:13.161 --> 17:14.944
but you're nowhere near the clubhouse?

17:14.945 --> 17:15.944
(Giggles)

17:15.997 --> 17:17.280
No, this is a real concern

17:17.281 --> 17:19.999
for men with enlarged
prostates in your age group.

17:20.035 --> 17:21.117
The solution...

17:22.954 --> 17:24.170
Sani-club.

17:25.457 --> 17:27.290
Looks like a regular 9 iron, right?

17:27.291 --> 17:29.042
But then you twist the top,

17:29.094 --> 17:32.962
and you can let 'er rip right
in the reservoir cavity, huh?

17:33.014 --> 17:34.347
And...

17:34.382 --> 17:36.266
comes with this towel for privacy
anywhere on the golf course.

17:38.353 --> 17:39.352
(Cell phone rings)

17:39.387 --> 17:43.356
I apologize, I have a
client who's introducing

17:43.391 --> 17:45.191
a new basketball shoe in China.

17:45.227 --> 17:47.143
I have to take this. Right back.

17:47.195 --> 17:48.311
(Into phone) Go for Glenn.

17:50.982 --> 17:53.032
Are you kidding me?

17:53.068 --> 17:55.368
This is like the junk they advertise

17:55.403 --> 17:57.153
on late night TV.

17:57.205 --> 17:59.205
Where's our sports equipment line?

17:59.241 --> 18:02.208
The Sani-club is sports equipment.

18:02.244 --> 18:03.326
Sort of.

18:03.361 --> 18:05.295
Kathryn.

18:05.330 --> 18:07.380
Well, he's just getting started.

18:07.415 --> 18:09.249
Maybe he's working up to it.

18:09.801 --> 18:12.168
We gotta hear him out.

18:20.011 --> 18:21.344
Need any help?

18:21.396 --> 18:23.229
Thanks.

18:23.265 --> 18:25.098
Some folks never learned in kindergarten

18:25.150 --> 18:27.267
- to clean up after themselves.
- (Laughs)

18:27.319 --> 18:30.236
So, you're pretty new to K.C., right?

18:30.272 --> 18:32.188
Eh, moved here last fall.

18:32.190 --> 18:34.073
Where are you from originally?

18:34.109 --> 18:36.993
Oh, you know... all over.

18:37.028 --> 18:38.161
Cool.

18:38.196 --> 18:40.063
What was your favorite place to live?

18:40.098 --> 18:41.948
(Sighs) I don't really have one.

18:42.000 --> 18:45.034
Well, what was one place that you liked?

18:45.086 --> 18:47.170
Well, I actually like Kansas City.

18:47.205 --> 18:48.171
Me too.

18:48.206 --> 18:50.957
I mean, I know I don't
want to stay here forever,

18:51.009 --> 18:53.042
but it was kind of cool growing up here.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.260
Did you know that we have more fountains

18:54.296 --> 18:56.262
than any city other than Rome?

18:56.298 --> 18:59.098
I didn't.

18:59.134 --> 19:01.134
That can go on the shelf, okay? Thanks.

19:03.221 --> 19:04.220
Uh...

19:04.272 --> 19:07.190
So what did you do before
you owned this place?

19:07.225 --> 19:09.025
(Chuckles)

19:09.060 --> 19:11.144
You sure ask a lot of questions.

19:11.196 --> 19:13.112
Just making conversation.

19:13.148 --> 19:16.199
Well, what did you do before
you started working here?

19:16.234 --> 19:18.067
Well...

19:18.119 --> 19:19.402
I am an artist.

19:19.404 --> 19:22.989
Yeah, Regina says you have a lot of talent.

19:23.041 --> 19:26.409
I'm actually getting a profile in
the <i>K.C. Star</i> this week.

19:26.411 --> 19:30.129
It's for this bench project I did.

19:30.165 --> 19:33.333
Hey, why don't we do the interview here?

19:33.385 --> 19:36.219
I mean, they could mention the coffeehouse,

19:36.254 --> 19:37.253
maybe snap some pics?

19:37.305 --> 19:39.222
I don't think that'd be a good idea.

19:39.257 --> 19:41.391
Regina: Hey! What's going on?

19:41.426 --> 19:44.260
Your daughter wants to get a picture of us

19:44.312 --> 19:46.145
in the <i>K.C. Star.</i>

19:46.181 --> 19:47.430
It would be great publicity.

19:47.432 --> 19:49.232
They could interview you and Eric.

19:49.267 --> 19:52.268
Well, that's probably not the best plan.

19:52.320 --> 19:53.436
Yeah.

19:53.438 --> 19:56.272
I mean, we still haven't
worked out all the kinks here.

19:59.110 --> 20:03.413
Okay. It's just for my art interview,
it's not <i>the New York Times.</i>

20:03.448 --> 20:05.999
Honey, just drop it, okay?

20:10.288 --> 20:12.055
Okay.

20:16.213 --> 20:17.705
Oh! Hey, you found them.

20:17.743 --> 20:19.576
Oh, thanks. I owe you one.

20:19.578 --> 20:21.461
- I gotta go.
- Great. See you tonight.

20:21.497 --> 20:22.663
Um...

20:22.715 --> 20:24.381
For?

20:24.416 --> 20:26.316
Angelo's birthday dinner.

20:26.352 --> 20:27.417
Oh. Right.

20:27.419 --> 20:28.585
Sorry, I can't.

20:28.587 --> 20:30.671
- I have my ride-along.
- Tonight?

20:30.723 --> 20:32.422
You can't reschedule?

20:32.474 --> 20:34.558
I have to get it done before spring break.

20:34.593 --> 20:36.476
I'm sure they would understand.

20:36.512 --> 20:37.728
No, they won't.

20:37.763 --> 20:39.479
I can't believe this.

20:39.515 --> 20:42.399
Bay, I care, I just have

20:42.434 --> 20:44.518
something to do that's really important.

20:44.570 --> 20:46.486
He was our dad.

20:46.522 --> 20:47.738
I know that.

20:47.773 --> 20:50.741
You and my mom will have
to celebrate without me.

20:56.749 --> 20:58.282
(Car door closes)

20:58.334 --> 20:59.366
(Car engine starts)

21:01.420 --> 21:03.503
Mm. Okay.

21:03.539 --> 21:05.622
So which one's the winner?

21:05.624 --> 21:06.707
Um...

21:09.345 --> 21:13.463
"Stain Uzi. Removes protein,
starch, and oil stains

21:13.499 --> 21:18.352
from common household fabrics
and surfaces. Guaranteed!"

21:18.387 --> 21:20.354
And that's the best we can do?

21:20.389 --> 21:22.472
You said you wanted something useful

21:22.474 --> 21:23.707
and not embarrassing.

21:23.742 --> 21:25.475
So...

21:25.477 --> 21:27.444
Let's try it out.

21:29.315 --> 21:31.281
Okay. Now what?

21:31.317 --> 21:32.399
All right...

21:34.320 --> 21:36.320
"Twist nozzle,

21:36.322 --> 21:39.356
spray until stain is completely covered,

21:39.375 --> 21:41.408
let sit for 30 seconds

21:41.460 --> 21:44.661
and then blot with a clean wet cloth."

21:46.799 --> 21:49.333
Damp rag. Got it. All right.

21:50.336 --> 21:51.718
That is not 30 seconds.

21:51.754 --> 21:53.470
Honey, it's plenty of time.

21:53.505 --> 21:54.538
Come on.

21:56.642 --> 21:58.308
Nothing is happening.

21:58.344 --> 22:00.560
Maybe we should've waited.

22:00.596 --> 22:02.229
Give me that.

22:03.432 --> 22:05.582
Oh... oh my god!

22:05.617 --> 22:07.601
John, look! Wh... what... what?

22:07.653 --> 22:10.237
Oh, there's gotta be some
kind of bleach in there.

22:10.272 --> 22:11.521
Ugh. Honey...

22:11.523 --> 22:13.440
No! Wait! That... that
one has product on it.

22:13.492 --> 22:14.608
- Okay. Fine.
- No... find something else.

22:14.660 --> 22:16.526
Okay. These are dry, okay?
Go get some clean wet ones!

22:16.528 --> 22:18.528
- Go! Go! Go!
- This rug is an antique.

22:18.530 --> 22:19.663
Ah, please.

22:19.698 --> 22:22.532
I told you we should've opened
a bottle of white instead.

22:25.454 --> 22:26.703
(Sirens wailing)

22:40.519 --> 22:42.302
Brad Ziff: Sir, my name
is Brad. I'm a paramedic.

22:42.354 --> 22:43.637
You've been in an
accident. Can you hear me?

22:46.642 --> 22:48.275
Ziff: So, sir, this is my partner.

22:48.310 --> 22:50.360
We're gonna just get you
stabilized, all right?

22:50.396 --> 22:53.363
- So just hang tight. Can you hear me?
- Sure.

22:53.399 --> 22:54.564
- Are you ready?
- Yelp if you feel any pain.

22:54.566 --> 22:56.450
Ziff: All right, ready? Tilt
his head up a little bit.

22:56.485 --> 22:57.567
Daphne's voice: <i>Don't go!</i>

22:57.619 --> 22:58.652
I'm going to my apartment, okay?

22:58.704 --> 23:00.237
I'll see you tomorrow.

23:00.239 --> 23:01.321
(Car engine starts)

23:02.574 --> 23:04.241
(Tires screech)

23:18.474 --> 23:19.589
Ziff: Check his pulse for me.

23:19.591 --> 23:21.391
All right, pupils are equal and reactive.

23:23.695 --> 23:26.730
You're gonna be all right. John,
can you count to five for me?

23:30.436 --> 23:33.270
That is great news.

23:33.272 --> 23:36.273
Me too. I'll see you later.

23:36.275 --> 23:39.409
You seem jazzed about something.

23:39.445 --> 23:42.362
We signed the lease on
the condo in Platte City.

23:42.414 --> 23:46.666
Wow. Congratulations.

23:48.337 --> 23:49.453
40 minutes away.

23:49.455 --> 23:52.289
I know, I'm a suburbanite.
Who would've thought?

23:52.291 --> 23:54.458
Well, at least I don't
drive a mini-van yet.

23:54.510 --> 23:55.625
Right.

23:55.677 --> 23:58.545
So are we cooking tonight or
do you want to get take-out?

23:58.597 --> 24:00.630
I can always just pick something up

24:00.632 --> 24:02.549
on my way back from the interview.

24:02.601 --> 24:04.568
Did we have plans?

24:04.603 --> 24:06.369
Angelo's birthday.

24:06.405 --> 24:09.372
Oh god, that's today.

24:09.408 --> 24:13.477
Daphne bailed, so it's just you and me.

24:13.512 --> 24:17.280
Honey, I have Will's
trumpet recital tonight.

24:18.450 --> 24:20.484
Why do you have to go?

24:20.536 --> 24:24.654
Because it's important to Eric and to Will.

24:24.656 --> 24:26.406
(Sniffling)

24:26.458 --> 24:27.491
What?

24:27.493 --> 24:29.459
It's all about Eric, isn't it?

24:29.495 --> 24:31.661
- Hey!
- You guys are practically twins.

24:31.713 --> 24:33.463
You even think alike.

24:33.499 --> 24:35.732
Is this about that newspaper
article that he didn't want?

24:35.767 --> 24:37.634
No. It's not about that.

24:41.340 --> 24:44.541
Honey, Eric is not Angelo,

24:44.576 --> 24:47.344
and he knows he will never replace

24:47.346 --> 24:49.646
Angelo in my heart or in yours.

24:49.681 --> 24:51.681
Then he won't mind that you take

24:51.733 --> 24:54.434
one night to remember your dead husband.

24:55.521 --> 24:57.387
I mind.

24:57.422 --> 24:59.439
I made these plans a week ago,

24:59.491 --> 25:01.608
and I'm not changing
them at the last minute.

25:01.660 --> 25:04.528
You, and I, and Daphne,

25:04.530 --> 25:07.330
we can celebrate Angelo's
birthday another night.

25:07.366 --> 25:08.365
Just forget it.

25:08.367 --> 25:10.450
I finished cleaning up, so can I go?

25:10.502 --> 25:11.535
I have that interview.

25:11.537 --> 25:13.336
Sure.

25:18.260 --> 25:19.426
(Sighs)

25:19.461 --> 25:20.677
(Siren wailing)

25:22.431 --> 25:23.713
Heads up, Montoya. Starting I.V.

25:23.715 --> 25:25.298
Copy. All clear.

25:25.350 --> 25:27.300
You're doing good, sir.
Just keep breathing.

25:27.352 --> 25:29.352
Squad 37 to Northdale Hospital.

25:29.388 --> 25:31.471
En route with 55-year-old male victim

25:31.523 --> 25:33.440
of a single car motor vehicle accident.

25:33.475 --> 25:35.442
Front end collision with a light pole...

25:35.477 --> 25:39.312
My daughter has red hair.

25:39.364 --> 25:41.398
Um, what did you say?

25:41.400 --> 25:44.534
You have red hair like my daughter.

25:44.570 --> 25:45.635
Ziff: Pulse is steady.

25:45.671 --> 25:47.571
Radio: <i>Copy that, squad 37.</i>

25:47.623 --> 25:50.574
I'm sure she'll be glad
that your car had air bags.

25:50.576 --> 25:55.412
Oh. (Chuckles) She's gonna chew me out,

25:55.464 --> 25:59.583
always says I drive too fast.

25:59.585 --> 26:03.253
Sounds like she cares about you a lot.

26:03.255 --> 26:06.256
She just got into grad school.

26:06.291 --> 26:07.340
(Heart rate monitor beeping)

26:10.662 --> 26:13.230
- (Beeping quickens)
- Ziff, something is wrong.

26:13.265 --> 26:14.347
He's coding. He's coding.

26:14.399 --> 26:16.316
- Montoya, he's coding!
- Two minutes out.

26:19.521 --> 26:21.571
Going into v-fib. Charging paddles at 200.

26:21.607 --> 26:22.689
Stand by for de-fib.

26:24.693 --> 26:26.576
Clear.

26:29.281 --> 26:30.247
Clear.

26:42.171 --> 26:43.303
Is he okay?

26:46.308 --> 26:48.392
The doctors did what they could, but...

26:54.183 --> 26:55.349
Are you all right?

26:59.388 --> 27:01.321
Some of us are going out for a drink.

27:01.357 --> 27:04.057
Come on. I'll buy you a...

27:04.093 --> 27:05.926
Root beer.

27:13.268 --> 27:16.336
So once I saw how Tess was juggling her job

27:16.372 --> 27:20.173
and a special needs kid, the
idea just sort of came to me.

27:20.209 --> 27:23.010
And you met Tess through community service?

27:23.045 --> 27:25.012
Um...

27:25.047 --> 27:28.015
I think so. It was a while ago.

27:28.050 --> 27:30.350
For a first time felony offense?

27:32.104 --> 27:33.387
Can you tell me what happened

27:33.422 --> 27:35.222
that lead you to commit a crime?

27:39.194 --> 27:40.977
My dad had just died.

27:43.165 --> 27:46.199
I'd only known him for a few years, but...

27:46.235 --> 27:49.236
we were finally starting
to feel like a family.

27:51.206 --> 27:54.241
I always thought he'd be around, but...

27:54.243 --> 27:57.310
then suddenly he was gone.

27:57.346 --> 27:59.179
You were overwhelmed by the loss.

28:01.016 --> 28:02.349
Actually, I wasn't.

28:02.384 --> 28:06.169
Um... my sister was.

28:06.221 --> 28:09.256
My biological mother was, but, uh...

28:12.061 --> 28:14.394
I held it together,

28:14.430 --> 28:17.013
because I had to.

28:17.066 --> 28:20.000
You kept a lid on your grief.

28:20.035 --> 28:23.153
But I guess that doesn't make it go away.

28:24.406 --> 28:26.940
Sooner or later, it comes out.

28:37.169 --> 28:41.171
Someone I was close to had
a similar accident last year.

28:41.206 --> 28:43.290
I think that's why I got...

28:45.177 --> 28:47.961
Look, I'm sorry to hear that.

28:47.963 --> 28:52.132
He hit a tree on Brixton Road,

28:52.184 --> 28:54.968
just past the power station.

28:54.970 --> 28:56.303
I know that area.

28:58.107 --> 29:01.274
An ambulance took him
to Northdale Hospital.

29:01.310 --> 29:03.210
Was that...

29:03.245 --> 29:06.980
Were you one of the
paramedics who treated him?

29:07.032 --> 29:08.281
I'm afraid not.

29:08.317 --> 29:12.202
I have never responded
to a call on Brixton.

29:12.237 --> 29:15.155
Do you think anyone here did?

29:15.157 --> 29:19.159
Uh... I... I don't know.

29:19.161 --> 29:20.994
Can you ask?

29:25.167 --> 29:26.416
Hey, guys,

29:26.468 --> 29:29.920
any of you respond to an M.V.A.
call last year on Brixton?

29:29.972 --> 29:33.173
Car hitting a tree?

29:33.175 --> 29:34.925
Classic silver Corvette?

29:34.977 --> 29:37.210
Yes.

29:37.246 --> 29:39.379
I remember that one.

29:39.414 --> 29:43.066
Did the driver say
anything when you were there

29:43.101 --> 29:45.235
or in the ambulance?

29:48.023 --> 29:50.357
Honestly...

29:50.392 --> 29:52.359
I don't remember.

29:55.097 --> 29:57.364
I don't think so.

30:04.373 --> 30:06.256
Excuse me.

30:28.113 --> 30:29.312
Are you all right?

30:32.317 --> 30:35.068
Not very professional, huh?

30:35.103 --> 30:37.204
It's all right.

30:37.239 --> 30:39.372
What were you hoping he'd say?

30:41.043 --> 30:43.043
I don't know.

30:44.279 --> 30:48.081
That my dad said something...

30:48.133 --> 30:50.250
profound.

30:52.337 --> 30:54.471
That he was scared.

30:54.506 --> 30:57.090
Or brave.

30:57.142 --> 31:00.227
Or that he was totally at peace.

31:03.999 --> 31:05.265
Anything.

31:07.236 --> 31:09.970
I can't remember my calls from last week.

31:10.005 --> 31:12.272
And that was, what, a year ago?

31:12.324 --> 31:14.374
Almost.

31:16.161 --> 31:19.329
When you're doing the job, the only
thing that matters is doing the job.

31:19.364 --> 31:21.248
Not chit-chat with the patient.

31:22.451 --> 31:23.950
But why?

31:24.002 --> 31:26.369
It's so easy, and it can
make such a difference.

31:26.421 --> 31:31.041
That man in the crash tonight
wanted to talk to somebody.

31:31.093 --> 31:33.426
I'm glad I was there.

31:33.462 --> 31:37.180
When I started out, I thought
all my calls would be like that.

31:37.215 --> 31:39.182
Making a difference.

31:39.217 --> 31:41.184
But it turns out that most are just like

31:41.219 --> 31:43.370
Punch and Judy from the other day.

31:43.405 --> 31:47.390
The same thing. Over and over.

31:47.442 --> 31:51.278
People knocking each other
out over stupid stuff.

31:51.313 --> 31:54.230
And it doesn't matter
how well you do your job,

31:54.283 --> 31:57.200
it won't make a lick of
difference in their lives.

32:00.355 --> 32:03.290
Most days you don't get to be a hero.

32:03.325 --> 32:05.959
That's the truth.

32:15.484 --> 32:17.818
Is it just me, or is
it returning to normal?

32:17.870 --> 32:19.686
(Scoffs)

32:19.722 --> 32:21.822
There's no saving that rug.

32:23.542 --> 32:25.909
I've got half a mind to
call up that Glenn guy

32:25.961 --> 32:29.496
and tell him where he can
stick his can of voodoo juice.

32:29.548 --> 32:31.698
- John...
- I'm serious.

32:31.734 --> 32:33.550
I was a four-time all star.

32:33.586 --> 32:34.885
I won two golden gloves.

32:34.920 --> 32:36.803
He knows who you are.

32:36.839 --> 32:38.555
Remember my second year in the league?

32:38.591 --> 32:41.508
- Mm-hmm.
- I turned down that beer commercial.

32:41.510 --> 32:44.478
National brands... that's what we should

32:44.513 --> 32:46.480
be hawking, not that crap.

32:48.734 --> 32:52.519
Honey, that was 20 years ago.

32:52.521 --> 32:54.521
Thank you.

32:55.824 --> 32:59.426
What I mean is, I don't think
it's Glenn you're mad at.

33:01.747 --> 33:03.764
Time moves on.

33:05.834 --> 33:07.701
Our kid is about to have a kid.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.538
This is where we are now.

33:12.741 --> 33:14.508
I know.

33:16.679 --> 33:18.478
Come on, champ.

33:18.514 --> 33:19.880
Let's not throw in the towel yet.

33:19.882 --> 33:21.615
Let's see how this voodoo juice

33:21.650 --> 33:23.717
- works on kitchen stains.
- (Laughs)

33:23.719 --> 33:26.687
- Oh, yeah.
- Come on!

33:26.722 --> 33:29.456
A little help?

34:27.783 --> 34:29.449
(Knocking on door)

34:32.755 --> 34:34.855
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:37.676 --> 34:39.543
How was the interview?

34:39.594 --> 34:41.594
It was... surprising.

34:43.632 --> 34:45.799
I'm sorry I was so grouchy today.

34:45.801 --> 34:48.768
You were right. It was about Angelo.

34:50.639 --> 34:52.773
Birthdays can bring up a lot.

34:56.745 --> 34:58.695
I cried the day that he died,

34:58.731 --> 35:01.698
and then after that, I just sort of...

35:01.734 --> 35:03.483
Shut off.

35:03.519 --> 35:07.788
But then this week, I
suddenly remembered how

35:07.823 --> 35:11.408
horrible I felt when I knew

35:11.460 --> 35:13.827
he wasn't gonna be there anymore.

35:15.731 --> 35:19.466
That's sort of how I felt when I
found out that you were moving away.

35:19.501 --> 35:22.836
Oh, I'm not leaving you.

35:22.838 --> 35:25.639
I'm just moving across town.

35:25.674 --> 35:28.425
So I thought that if I
worked at the Cracked Mug,

35:28.477 --> 35:30.761
then at least I could
spend more time with you.

35:30.813 --> 35:32.512
Oh, honey.

35:32.514 --> 35:33.730
I'm still just getting to know you,

35:33.766 --> 35:35.432
and if you move to Platte City,

35:35.484 --> 35:38.518
then I'm gonna see you less and less.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.771
That is not true.

35:40.823 --> 35:44.524
We're gonna have dinners and game night.

35:44.576 --> 35:47.828
There's even an extra room for
you and Daphne to sleep over.

35:47.863 --> 35:50.697
And besides, you were gonna move

35:50.733 --> 35:53.533
hundreds of miles away to California.

35:53.569 --> 35:55.619
But I always thought that you would

35:55.671 --> 35:56.920
be home when I got back.

35:58.791 --> 36:00.707
I'm so sorry.

36:00.709 --> 36:04.795
I didn't know that my moving
mattered that much to you.

36:04.847 --> 36:07.614
Of course it matters.

36:07.649 --> 36:09.800
You're my mom.

36:09.852 --> 36:11.885
Oh, sweetie.

36:22.338 --> 36:24.004
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:24.056 --> 36:26.840
Glenn called. We have an offer.

36:26.893 --> 36:28.943
Do I even wanna ask how much?

36:28.978 --> 36:31.929
It's not the answer to all our problems,

36:31.981 --> 36:33.264
but it's a good short-term boost.

36:33.316 --> 36:35.316
That's what we need right now.

36:35.351 --> 36:38.102
That and a new rug.

36:39.906 --> 36:42.022
Do you really want to do this?

36:42.024 --> 36:43.274
Honey, we talked about this.

36:43.326 --> 36:45.192
It's not a shampoo or a fancy car, but...

36:45.244 --> 36:48.128
I mean plugging a product
we know doesn't work.

36:48.164 --> 36:50.164
It works on some things.

36:50.199 --> 36:51.949
No product is perfect.

36:52.001 --> 36:53.918
And Glenn's gonna let us say that?

36:53.953 --> 36:57.121
"Hey, try this. It kinda works."

36:57.173 --> 37:00.925
Honey, we need the money.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.259
Our backs are against the wall.

37:02.295 --> 37:04.929
If you don't want to
do this, we won't do it,

37:04.964 --> 37:07.014
but we're running out of options.

37:10.970 --> 37:13.320
I remember...

37:13.356 --> 37:17.191
The first day we opened this place.

37:17.226 --> 37:20.094
The way it gleamed with that
fresh coat of white paint.

37:20.129 --> 37:23.280
I was so proud to have my name on it.

37:23.316 --> 37:26.900
People loved meeting you.

37:26.936 --> 37:28.102
I shook so many hands,

37:28.120 --> 37:29.987
I thought I was gonna get carpal tunnel.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.324
We were so busy.

37:35.911 --> 37:37.244
What happened?

37:38.331 --> 37:40.080
It's like you say,

37:40.082 --> 37:42.333
it's an up and down business.

37:42.385 --> 37:44.301
We could get a new color scheme,

37:44.337 --> 37:47.087
or new signage...

37:47.139 --> 37:51.225
The only way this place
is gonna make us any money,

37:51.260 --> 37:52.343
is if we sell it.

37:54.263 --> 37:56.313
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

37:56.349 --> 37:58.866
Just took me a while to get there.

38:10.079 --> 38:11.945
Wait... wait. Wait.

38:11.947 --> 38:13.080
You're not coming?

38:13.115 --> 38:15.015
I'm sorry.

38:15.051 --> 38:16.917
Is this about the swim trunks

38:16.952 --> 38:19.286
I wore the other day?
Because I have others.

38:19.288 --> 38:23.874
No. I have the chance to
go to Mexico with Melody

38:23.926 --> 38:26.960
and give our hearing aids to
people who can't afford their own.

38:27.013 --> 38:29.129
That's a really dumb thing to do.

38:29.165 --> 38:31.882
I'm kidding. It's great,

38:31.934 --> 38:35.135
and you're an awesome person for doing it.

38:35.137 --> 38:36.937
You wouldn't happen to know anybody

38:36.972 --> 38:38.939
who wants an extra wristband

38:38.974 --> 38:42.309
for a really banging pool
party in South Padre, do you?

38:50.186 --> 38:51.318
Kathryn: Platte City?

38:51.370 --> 38:53.320
Bay's taking it pretty hard.

38:53.356 --> 38:55.322
Well, none of us want to see you go,

38:55.374 --> 38:57.157
especially that far.

38:57.209 --> 39:00.160
Have you thought about
asking them to move in here?

39:00.162 --> 39:02.246
Funny you should mention that.

39:02.298 --> 39:05.049
How would you feel about an energetic

39:05.084 --> 39:06.967
nine-year old and his handsome father

39:07.002 --> 39:08.202
moving in across the driveway?

39:08.237 --> 39:10.838
- Uh...
- You don't have to ask permission.

39:10.890 --> 39:12.256
It's your house, too.

39:12.308 --> 39:14.925
Great.

39:14.977 --> 39:17.111
But we insist on paying rent.

39:17.146 --> 39:20.064
- Regina, you don't have to...
- Eric insists.

39:20.099 --> 39:22.149
It's only way he'll agree to move in.

39:23.352 --> 39:25.936
Well, if that's the only way...

39:25.988 --> 39:26.937
It is.

39:26.989 --> 39:31.024
The house is feeling full again!

39:31.077 --> 39:32.276
Okay!

39:34.997 --> 39:36.330
So I finally get to taste

39:36.365 --> 39:40.033
the famous Sorrento family lemon cake.

39:40.086 --> 39:41.952
I hope I got it right.

39:49.879 --> 39:52.212
Mm. Damn.

39:54.884 --> 39:59.052
Our great-grandmother
must have been some cook.

40:00.222 --> 40:04.141
Angelo made this for
me when I was pregnant.

40:04.193 --> 40:07.111
Reminded him of his family.

40:09.932 --> 40:11.198
And now that he was having a daughter...

40:11.233 --> 40:14.067
He wanted to keep the tradition alive.

40:16.238 --> 40:18.038
And we will.

40:21.377 --> 40:23.143
To Angelo.

40:23.179 --> 40:24.912
To Angelo.

40:24.914 --> 40:26.380
Happy Birthday.

40:31.253 --> 40:33.086
Mm.

40:33.139 --> 40:35.255
So, I have news.

40:35.307 --> 40:38.008
Guess who else is gonna go

40:38.060 --> 40:41.178
on that trip to Mexico with Melody?

40:41.230 --> 40:43.096
- What? No way?
- Mm-hmm.

40:43.149 --> 40:45.182
She said I could take one day

40:45.234 --> 40:47.184
to go into the city to do my interview

40:47.236 --> 40:49.601
for the Frida Kahlo program.

40:49.663 --> 40:51.397
In person!

40:51.432 --> 40:54.134
You are gonna make
a huge impression.

40:54.168 --> 40:56.569
I'm so happy you're coming!

40:56.603 --> 41:00.272
Mm. Did you know
that Frida's original furniture

41:00.307 --> 41:02.741
- is still in her bedroom?
- Mm-hmm.

41:02.775 --> 41:04.343
And her <i>tehuana</i> dresses.

41:04.377 --> 41:05.711
You're gonna love them.

41:05.745 --> 41:08.180
What is your guys'
obsession with Frida Kahlo?

41:08.215 --> 41:09.982
I don't get it. I never did.

41:10.016 --> 41:13.152
It's because
I am the real latina here.

41:13.186 --> 41:14.185
Watch it.

41:14.220 --> 41:15.419
Okay, girls, you're both pretty.

41:15.454 --> 41:17.755
- Come on. None of that.
- (Laughs)
