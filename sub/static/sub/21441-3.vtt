00:14.793 --> 00:16.792
Previously on Get Shorty...

00:16.872 --> 00:18.999
If you're making a movie, it is
some kind of racket. I...

00:19.000 --> 00:19.999
It's not.

00:20.119 --> 00:21.824
There's always an angle.

00:21.945 --> 00:22.944
We watched your movie,

00:22.945 --> 00:23.944
Sins of a Chambermaid.

00:23.945 --> 00:25.944
You think that we can use two million

00:25.945 --> 00:27.944
and make a movie that turns out...

00:27.945 --> 00:28.944
- Better?
- Right.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.008
Let's get a big studio.

00:30.127 --> 00:31.944
What about that girl that I met at
your office, from Gravity Pictures?

00:31.945 --> 00:33.444
I hope the project goes well.

00:33.508 --> 00:34.944
I'm not gonna be on it,

00:34.945 --> 00:35.944
- but I look forward to seein' it...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:35.945 --> 00:36.944
...at the local art-house.

00:36.945 --> 00:38.945
Lose my number, please.

00:41.245 --> 00:42.789
Open the fuckin' safe!

03:22.945 --> 03:24.945
Who open door for them?

03:26.945 --> 03:27.945
You?

03:29.945 --> 03:31.944
They had a shotgun on Clipper.

03:31.945 --> 03:33.944
Door locks on the inside.

03:33.945 --> 03:34.944
Yeah, but Clip knocked like usual,

03:34.945 --> 03:36.957
and from the monitor I
couldn't see the other dudes.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.945
So you open.

03:40.945 --> 03:41.945
Who open safe?

03:45.945 --> 03:47.944
I mean, they were serious as shit.

03:47.945 --> 03:49.944
They was about to
put a bullet in his head...

03:57.945 --> 03:59.944
- How much?
- All of yesterday.

03:59.945 --> 04:00.944
About 50 grand.

04:00.945 --> 04:03.945
And just this safe. They didn't
touch the casino cash box.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.944
Josias is a dead man.

04:06.945 --> 04:09.944
I will personally take him the fuck
out, Tia, I promise, okay?

04:09.945 --> 04:10.944
I will get him.

04:10.945 --> 04:12.944
- I will...
- No.

04:12.945 --> 04:13.944
Let me do this... Por favor.

04:17.945 --> 04:19.945
I will take care of Josias.

04:35.945 --> 04:37.944
No, no, no!

04:37.945 --> 04:39.944
- No!
- What the fuck? What?

04:42.945 --> 04:43.945
I was dreaming.

04:45.945 --> 04:46.944
I thought the place was on fire.

04:46.945 --> 04:48.944
Sorry.

04:49.945 --> 04:51.944
I dreamed Amara was here.

04:51.945 --> 04:53.944
Like, she was in the room?

04:53.945 --> 04:54.945
She wanted to see the
movie that we made.

04:55.945 --> 04:57.944
I said, "The movie's not happening,

04:57.945 --> 04:58.944
"but we'll give you all the money back

04:58.945 --> 05:01.944
"except for what we spent
on drinks last night."

05:01.945 --> 05:02.944
And she said, "Well, how many drinks?"

05:02.945 --> 05:05.944
And I said, "Two," which was a lie.

05:05.945 --> 05:08.952
And she said, "Okay, two drinks.

05:09.008 --> 05:12.945
"So, I'll cut off your
balls and your dick."

05:13.945 --> 05:15.945
Well, your balls should count for two.

05:16.945 --> 05:18.944
You should be allowed to keep your dick.

05:18.945 --> 05:19.944
Yeah.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.944
Yeah. It wasn't fair.

05:21.945 --> 05:25.944
Anyway, Amara doesn't want the
money back until we've cleaned it.

05:25.945 --> 05:27.944
But we don't have any
way of doing that anymore.

05:27.945 --> 05:29.945
The producer quit.

05:30.621 --> 05:31.945
He didn't quit.

05:32.945 --> 05:34.944
It sounded like he did.

05:35.945 --> 05:37.944
You should stop dreaming, man.

05:37.945 --> 05:39.944
Makes you very negative.

05:39.945 --> 05:41.944
Whoa.

05:41.945 --> 05:43.944
Whoa.

05:43.945 --> 05:45.945
Are you saying that
you can get him back?

05:47.381 --> 05:48.380
Huh?

05:48.945 --> 05:49.944
How are you gonna get him back?

05:49.945 --> 05:51.944
Just gonna have a shower.

05:59.945 --> 06:01.130
How'd it go last night?

06:01.273 --> 06:02.201
I quit.

06:02.400 --> 06:03.937
Quit what?

06:04.135 --> 06:05.135
Quit the movie?

06:06.945 --> 06:07.944
Yeah, I sort of implied it.

06:07.945 --> 06:09.944
Did I mention that my paycheck bounced?

06:09.945 --> 06:11.353
You can't afford to quit.

06:11.460 --> 06:12.459
I realize that.

06:12.519 --> 06:13.395
I'm gonna get Miles Daly on the phone.

06:13.436 --> 06:13.713
No.

06:13.762 --> 06:15.161
Tell him that you didn't mean it.

06:15.215 --> 06:16.777
I did mean it.

06:16.840 --> 06:17.840
At the time.

06:20.945 --> 06:23.944
This morning... A little less so.

06:23.945 --> 06:25.944
But...

06:25.945 --> 06:28.945
You have to let them
know who's the boss here.

06:30.053 --> 06:32.259
You want a good deal on a... A car,

06:32.293 --> 06:33.292
you walk out of the dealership.

06:33.945 --> 06:35.596
If they go with another producer...

06:35.643 --> 06:36.642
They don't know anybody.

06:36.945 --> 06:39.945
Producers in Hahrump,
Nevada, are cooking meth.

06:41.945 --> 06:43.945
Moreweather Productions.

06:44.945 --> 06:46.944
Uh, I'll see if I have him.

06:48.945 --> 06:49.945
Miles.

06:53.945 --> 06:55.944
See?

06:55.945 --> 06:57.944
See?

06:57.940 --> 07:00.939
Okay. Well, you him that, uh,

07:00.945 --> 07:02.944
tell him I have a busy schedule, but...

07:02.945 --> 07:04.249
we'll see if we can squeeze him in.

07:04.389 --> 07:05.388
Tell him.

07:05.421 --> 07:06.421
Okay.

07:07.945 --> 07:09.944
Mr. Daly?

07:09.945 --> 07:11.945
Mr. Moreweather is very busy.
We'll see if we can squeeze...

07:14.945 --> 07:15.944
I offended you at dinner.

07:15.945 --> 07:18.179
I see that.

07:18.238 --> 07:20.238
I hope you'll accept our apology.

07:29.680 --> 07:32.021
You guys understand what
you're asking me to do here.

07:32.133 --> 07:34.944
Make a movie with cash.

07:34.945 --> 07:37.944
Industry people, they like benefits.

07:37.945 --> 07:40.944
Okay, I don't know how I'm
gonna get a crew together.

07:40.945 --> 07:43.945
But I'll do it, under one condition.

07:44.945 --> 07:45.944
No big studio.

07:45.945 --> 07:46.945
- Done.
- Wait. Just...

07:47.945 --> 07:50.945
Just remind me, why no studio?

07:54.417 --> 07:58.496
Thirty years ago, I tried
to make a prestige picture.

07:58.791 --> 08:01.790
Serious film, financed by Columbia.

08:01.791 --> 08:05.790
I wanted to be a visionary
filmmaker and, and win awards.

08:05.791 --> 08:07.791
Instead, I had to mortgage my house.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.790
But I learned a very valuable lesson.

08:13.791 --> 08:14.790
A valuable lesson.

08:14.791 --> 08:18.790
If you wanna make a profit...

08:18.791 --> 08:20.790
Go low budget, sell overseas.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.790
What the fuck is that?

08:22.791 --> 08:25.790
It's an AC unit for the stages.
That'll go off in a minute.

08:25.791 --> 08:27.790
Do we have a deal?

08:27.791 --> 08:28.790
No big studio.

08:28.791 --> 08:29.790
Deal.

08:29.791 --> 08:30.790
Great.

08:30.791 --> 08:32.789
Beautiful. Gladys!

08:32.791 --> 08:34.791
Get the paperwork.

08:35.791 --> 08:36.789
Okay, as the writer...

08:39.791 --> 08:43.789
...you give us an option for the
material. It's pretty straightforward.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.791
And, uh, ID badges.

08:46.791 --> 08:48.790
Cool.

08:48.791 --> 08:50.790
Here's the cash. I'm gonna go...

08:51.791 --> 08:54.791
Gonna go back to Nevada now
and get the next installment.

08:56.791 --> 08:57.791
Fives and tens.

08:58.791 --> 09:00.790
Mixed denominations.

09:00.791 --> 09:01.791
Easier to spend.

09:21.791 --> 09:22.791
Get out.

09:34.791 --> 09:36.790
What? Why can't you do it?

09:46.791 --> 09:48.791
We're with Amara.

09:49.791 --> 09:50.790
You understand?

09:50.791 --> 09:51.791
You tell Josias.

09:52.791 --> 09:53.790
Si.

09:56.791 --> 09:57.791
Gracias.

10:01.791 --> 10:04.790
You know, my sister Brynlee
called me this morning.

10:04.791 --> 10:07.790
She asked if I'd found
a church here in LA.

10:07.791 --> 10:09.791
Told her I hadn't.

10:10.791 --> 10:11.791
Maybe I better find one.

10:13.791 --> 10:15.194
So you can confess your sins?

10:16.791 --> 10:17.790
Mormons don't have confessional.

10:17.791 --> 10:19.790
We confess directly to God.

10:19.791 --> 10:22.790
Oh! You must have him on
the speed-dial at this stage.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.790
I'm glad that my faith is
a source of humor for you.

10:26.791 --> 10:28.790
Hey, I'm parked this way.

10:28.832 --> 10:30.499
Uh... I'm just gonna
settle over here for

10:30.505 --> 10:32.790
a minute, outside April Quinn's office.

10:32.791 --> 10:33.790
Wait, who's that?

10:33.791 --> 10:35.790
She's an executive at Gravity Pictures.

10:35.791 --> 10:37.790
- Oh, come on!
- Look. Look.

10:37.791 --> 10:39.790
We need Rick 'cause he'll use cash.

10:39.791 --> 10:42.790
But his movies are shite. You saw it.

10:42.791 --> 10:45.790
But if we get a budget
and a proper studio... Oh!

10:45.791 --> 10:46.790
You knew that you were gonna do this

10:46.791 --> 10:48.790
the whole time we were
in there with Rick.

10:48.791 --> 10:49.790
And you didn't tell me.

10:49.791 --> 10:50.790
You seemed busy.

10:50.791 --> 10:52.790
Look, you're already a producer.

10:52.791 --> 10:54.790
Who cares if it's a good movie?

10:54.791 --> 10:55.791
Who cares?

10:57.791 --> 10:59.790
Lou, we're making something.

10:59.791 --> 11:02.790
You don't see that? We're using
our hands and our fuckin' heads

11:02.791 --> 11:03.791
and we're making something.

11:07.895 --> 11:09.791
Well, fine.

11:10.791 --> 11:12.790
But the next time you
pull shit like this,

11:12.791 --> 11:15.404
you let me know, up front.

11:15.690 --> 11:16.689
Okay?

11:16.690 --> 11:17.689
- Done.
- Okay.

11:17.690 --> 11:20.689
So I'm just gonna let you
handle this woman by yourself.

11:20.690 --> 11:23.689
And I'm gonna go buy an
air mattress that holds air.

11:23.690 --> 11:24.689
Hold on. How am I supposed
to get back to the apartment?

11:24.690 --> 11:27.690
I don't know. Should've
thought of that earlier.

12:02.181 --> 12:03.180
Hi.

12:03.690 --> 12:06.689
Oh. Hey! Uh...

12:06.690 --> 12:07.689
The executive, right?

12:07.690 --> 12:09.689
Yeah, also known as April.

12:09.690 --> 12:10.689
Miles.

12:10.690 --> 12:12.689
Right. I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to stop you.

12:12.690 --> 12:16.689
No, no, no. I'm just coming
from a... From a meeting.

12:16.690 --> 12:17.689
It's good to see you.

12:17.690 --> 12:18.689
Yeah.

12:18.690 --> 12:20.689
Uh, how's everything at, uh,

12:20.690 --> 12:21.689
which studio was it?

12:21.690 --> 12:23.689
- Gravity Pictures.
- That's right, yeah.

12:23.690 --> 12:25.689
It's good, yeah. Can't complain.

12:25.690 --> 12:27.689
Do you, you work on the lot?

12:27.690 --> 12:29.689
Yeah, yeah. I'm producing a film.

12:29.690 --> 12:33.689
But when we met, you said you'd
been a producer for three hours.

12:33.690 --> 12:35.689
Nah, that was last week. I'm
pretty much an expert now.

12:37.690 --> 12:39.689
Maybe, um...

12:39.690 --> 12:40.690
Maybe we should get a coffee sometime.

12:41.773 --> 12:43.948
Maybe we should.

12:44.121 --> 12:46.661
I'm actually on my way
there now, if you wanna join.

12:46.741 --> 12:48.689
I've got a script I think
you might be interested in...

12:48.690 --> 12:50.689
No, no, no. No scripts.

12:50.690 --> 12:51.689
Oh, you will love this.

12:51.690 --> 12:54.689
It's a love story, set
in England in the 1800s.

12:54.690 --> 12:56.689
- This guy is...
- Oh, my God, that's perfect.

12:56.690 --> 12:57.880
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:57.951 --> 13:01.689
I have this special paper-shredder
that I use for period dramas.

13:01.690 --> 13:04.689
It sounds like a wood chipper.
It's, like,

13:04.690 --> 13:06.689
Got it.

13:06.690 --> 13:08.689
But we'll get coffee.

13:08.690 --> 13:10.689
Uh, not now, but call my office.

13:10.690 --> 13:13.690
April Quinn, Tepper Building.

13:14.690 --> 13:15.690
We'll do it this week.

13:16.690 --> 13:18.689
I'll do that.

13:20.690 --> 13:22.689
I still think you're gonna love this.

13:22.690 --> 13:24.690
No, no. No scripts.

13:41.690 --> 13:43.690
Went pretty good.

13:44.690 --> 13:45.689
80 grand and some change.

13:45.690 --> 13:47.689
More than they took from us yesterday.

13:47.690 --> 13:49.689
Josias will come back at us.

13:49.695 --> 13:51.214
We got two guys at every entrance.

13:53.690 --> 13:55.689
Is that the movie?

13:55.690 --> 13:56.689
Yeah.

13:56.690 --> 13:57.690
I don't get it.

14:01.690 --> 14:03.689
Read it to me.

14:03.690 --> 14:04.690
Me?

14:05.690 --> 14:07.689
You want me to read it out loud?

14:07.690 --> 14:08.690
From the beginning.

14:13.690 --> 14:15.690
"The Admiral's Mistress.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.689
"Fade in. Ext."

14:19.690 --> 14:21.689
What is that? "Ext?"

14:21.690 --> 14:22.690
Don't know.

14:23.690 --> 14:26.689
"Ext. Munro estate, evening.

14:26.690 --> 14:30.689
"Rolling hills give way to
chalk cliffs and gray ocean.

14:30.690 --> 14:33.689
"Reveal Lord Munro, 50s,

14:33.690 --> 14:37.690
"handsome despite his
lined visa... Visage?"

14:38.690 --> 14:40.690
Vi-something.

14:41.690 --> 14:43.689
"With him is Lillian, 17.

14:43.690 --> 14:47.689
"Lillian. 'Are you certain Lord
Culph will attend the ball?'

14:47.690 --> 14:48.689
"Munro. 'Quite sure.'

14:48.690 --> 14:52.689
"Lilian. 'I am not so foolish
as to hope for an audience,

14:52.690 --> 14:53.689
"'but I would lay eyes on him.'"

14:53.690 --> 14:55.689
"Lay eyes?"

14:55.690 --> 14:56.690
What it says.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.689
"Munro looks at her
with rep... Repro..."

15:01.690 --> 15:03.690
Reproach?

15:04.690 --> 15:05.689
Yeah.

15:05.690 --> 15:09.689
"Then produces a snuff box,
holding a pinch to his nose."

15:09.690 --> 15:10.689
Snuff is cocaina?

15:10.690 --> 15:12.690
I think.

15:13.690 --> 15:15.690
Go on.

15:19.205 --> 15:20.205
Yo.

15:23.690 --> 15:24.690
You okay?

15:28.690 --> 15:30.689
Don't take it so hard, man.

15:30.690 --> 15:33.689
Like 50K, man. Shit, that ain't nothing.

15:33.690 --> 15:35.689
I should've been on
that raid this morning.

15:35.690 --> 15:37.689
I'm the one got my head cracked open.

15:37.690 --> 15:39.690
Amara's looking after you, cuz.

15:42.690 --> 15:43.689
You get stitches?

15:43.690 --> 15:45.690
- Fuck stitches.
- Yeah.

15:46.690 --> 15:47.689
Drink, sir.

15:47.690 --> 15:49.690
Give me the shit.

15:51.690 --> 15:53.689
Uh, maybe you should chill, you know?

15:53.690 --> 15:54.690
Till you feel better.

15:56.690 --> 15:58.690
Don't patronize me.

16:17.690 --> 16:19.690
You know what Ed told me this morning?

16:20.690 --> 16:22.689
That when Miles gets back from LA,

16:22.690 --> 16:24.690
I have to hand that bitch 600 grand.

16:26.690 --> 16:27.689
I said, "We should be running that cash

16:27.690 --> 16:28.690
"through the nightclub."

16:30.690 --> 16:32.690
600 G's.

16:34.690 --> 16:37.689
How about I stab him
in the throat 600 times?

16:37.690 --> 16:39.689
Hmm? Does that work?

16:39.690 --> 16:41.689
Yeah, that work for me.

16:46.690 --> 16:49.689
What if Miles turns up in the LA river?

16:49.690 --> 16:51.690
LA got a river? I thought
that shit dried up.

16:53.690 --> 16:56.689
No, I'm saying if he gets dropped in LA,

16:56.690 --> 16:57.690
that shit doesn't come back on us.

16:58.690 --> 17:00.689
We say that's LA shit.

17:00.690 --> 17:02.690
Something he got into.

17:04.690 --> 17:07.689
I don't have people in LA, but...

17:07.690 --> 17:09.689
I think my people got people in LA.

17:09.690 --> 17:11.689
All right. Well, it's
time to get a handle

17:11.690 --> 17:12.690
on this situation.

17:24.690 --> 17:25.689
I took a cab, in case you're wondering

17:25.690 --> 17:26.690
how I got home.

17:28.690 --> 17:30.690
You ever hear of UberPOOL?

17:31.690 --> 17:33.689
Yeah. How is it?

17:33.690 --> 17:34.689
Oh, yeah, it's great.

17:34.690 --> 17:36.689
If you wanna listen to a gobshite

17:36.690 --> 17:38.689
talk about fuckin' Pilates.

17:38.690 --> 17:41.689
Yeah, everything's different in LA.

17:41.690 --> 17:43.690
TV stations are on different channels.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.690
April Quinn didn't go for it.

17:48.690 --> 17:50.689
- No?
- Nah.

17:50.690 --> 17:51.689
I was thinking I could swing over there,

17:51.690 --> 17:53.690
maybe try and twist her arm.

17:57.690 --> 18:00.689
Then I remembered I have to go Nevada

18:00.690 --> 18:02.690
for Emma's graduation, so...

18:04.690 --> 18:07.689
So... You want me to go do it?

18:07.690 --> 18:08.689
Oh, that's a good idea.

18:08.690 --> 18:11.689
Look, I just don't see
why you need a studio.

18:11.690 --> 18:13.689
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.

18:13.690 --> 18:15.690
It's gotta be a good movie.

18:16.690 --> 18:18.689
Okay.

18:18.690 --> 18:20.689
Just give me her address.
I'll go over there.

18:20.690 --> 18:21.689
I'll smack some sense into her.

18:21.690 --> 18:22.690
Good man.

18:24.690 --> 18:28.689
Actually, maybe don't get physical,

18:28.690 --> 18:29.690
unless you have to.

18:30.690 --> 18:32.689
Okay. All right.

18:32.690 --> 18:34.689
- What do I... I mean how...
- Just dig up something up

18:34.690 --> 18:36.689
that's of use.

18:36.690 --> 18:39.689
Like, maybe she's a cokehead,
or she's screwing her boss.

18:39.690 --> 18:41.689
So I'm taking pictures?

18:41.690 --> 18:43.689
So, like, I'm climbing up a
fuckin' tree outside her window?

18:43.690 --> 18:45.689
Nobody's asking you to climb trees.

18:45.690 --> 18:46.689
Just find something that we can use.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.690
All right.

18:49.690 --> 18:50.689
When we're holding our Oscars...

18:50.690 --> 18:52.690
- Don't talk to me.
- Okay.

18:56.690 --> 18:59.689
And I'm not going through her garbage!

18:59.690 --> 19:01.689
Six week shoot. It's all in LA.

19:01.690 --> 19:02.689
I know you're available.

19:02.690 --> 19:04.689
I'm not doing low budget stuff anymore.

19:04.690 --> 19:06.689
Takes too much out of me.

19:06.690 --> 19:08.689
Okay, well, whatever
they're paying you here,

19:08.690 --> 19:09.689
I can match it.

19:09.690 --> 19:12.689
- My full quote.
- And your guys, too.

19:12.690 --> 19:15.689
UPM, first AD, whoever you want.

19:15.690 --> 19:17.689
If that's true, we should talk.

19:17.690 --> 19:19.689
See? We can work it out.

19:19.690 --> 19:20.689
Yeah, long as they take cash,

19:20.690 --> 19:23.689
I will match whatever
they usually bring in,

19:23.690 --> 19:25.689
after taxes.

19:25.690 --> 19:26.689
Why would you pay in cash?

19:26.690 --> 19:29.689
Investor. Very nice
lady, right outside Vegas.

19:29.690 --> 19:31.689
Uh-uh. Either you set up payroll,

19:31.690 --> 19:34.689
or this is a no-go. I should get back.

19:34.690 --> 19:37.689
What? Now everything
is by the book with you?

19:37.690 --> 19:38.690
Come on!

19:39.690 --> 19:40.689
One M. Night Shyamalan movie,

19:40.690 --> 19:42.690
now you're too good for me, right?

19:58.690 --> 19:59.690
I have 20 minutes.

20:38.690 --> 20:39.690
Yeah, it was great.

20:40.690 --> 20:42.689
That was fun.

20:42.690 --> 20:44.690
Yeah.

20:45.690 --> 20:47.689
Yeah, all right. Good night.

20:47.690 --> 20:49.690
Bye.

21:13.690 --> 21:15.689
Yago? This is Miles.

21:15.690 --> 21:18.689
I waited around for two
hours and you never showed.

21:18.690 --> 21:20.689
You probably know, I'm supposed
to get something from you

21:20.690 --> 21:22.689
before I go back to LA.

21:22.690 --> 21:25.690
So if you would could just let
me know where and when, that's...

21:28.690 --> 21:30.689
That's gonna happen,
that would be lovely.

21:30.690 --> 21:32.689
Okay, bye.

21:32.690 --> 21:34.689
Parents and students,

21:34.690 --> 21:36.689
please find your seats. We
will begin in just a moment.

21:38.690 --> 21:39.689
Miles.

21:39.690 --> 21:41.689
Hey there. Hey, Jeffrey.

21:41.690 --> 21:43.690
Hey. Join us.

21:44.690 --> 21:46.689
Could you scooch over?

21:46.690 --> 21:47.689
Miles, just...

21:47.690 --> 21:50.690
Ah, no, it's... It's okay.

22:00.690 --> 22:02.689
When did she start wearing her hair up?

22:02.690 --> 22:04.689
Her friends do it.

22:04.690 --> 22:07.689
You know, she was talking like
she didn't care about the ceremony,

22:07.690 --> 22:08.689
then she changed her outfit three times.

22:11.690 --> 22:13.690
I told her you were in LA
'cause you're making a movie.

22:16.690 --> 22:18.689
You tell her you
thought it was bullshit?

22:18.690 --> 22:22.690
That I didn't know much
about it, which is true.

22:26.690 --> 22:28.689
Looks real, doesn't it?

22:28.690 --> 22:30.690
That's 'cause it is.

22:31.690 --> 22:32.689
I'll take your word for it.

22:32.690 --> 22:35.690
No, you won't, that's why
I have to show it to you.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.689
I was thinking that Emma could
come and watch us film there,

22:39.690 --> 22:42.689
when we're up and running.

22:42.690 --> 22:45.689
Well, I'll look at the calendar,
but she's got a busy summer already.

22:45.690 --> 22:48.689
Oh. Doing what?

22:48.690 --> 22:50.689
Seeing my mom in Colorado.

22:50.690 --> 22:52.689
She's got, uh, camp at the country club.

22:52.690 --> 22:54.689
Oh, golf camp?

22:54.690 --> 22:56.689
It's not just golf. I mean, there's...

22:56.690 --> 22:58.689
Does she even like golf?

22:58.690 --> 22:59.689
- Yeah.
- Oh?

22:59.690 --> 23:00.689
Actually, she does.

23:00.690 --> 23:02.689
She's got a natural ability.

23:02.690 --> 23:03.689
Is that right?

23:03.690 --> 23:05.690
Well, that's good to know, isn't it?

23:07.690 --> 23:09.968
So I can't spend time with my daughter

23:10.047 --> 23:13.689
because you're sending her to golf camp.

23:13.690 --> 23:15.689
Ladies and gentlemen,

23:15.690 --> 23:20.689
please join me in welcoming the Paradise
Springs Middle School Class of 2018!

25:47.690 --> 25:50.689
Okay. We want things
for the table, right?

25:50.690 --> 25:52.689
- Uh, nachos, chicken tenders...
- Yes.

25:52.690 --> 25:56.689
Oh, they're called adobe tenders
here. And I want a strawberry water.

25:56.690 --> 25:57.466
Wow.

25:57.482 --> 25:59.371
Hey, uh, did you bring
my soccer cleats, Dad?

26:00.690 --> 26:01.689
Was I supposed to?

26:01.690 --> 26:02.689
She left them at your
place. I texted you.

26:02.690 --> 26:04.689
Uh, I think I must have missed that.

26:04.690 --> 26:06.689
You know what? I'll pick them up.

26:06.690 --> 26:09.689
You live in Pahrump, right?
Plus, I owe you a golf club.

26:09.690 --> 26:11.689
Remember, I got that
dinner in Amargosa Valley.

26:11.690 --> 26:13.689
It's easy. I'll pick
'em up on my way out.

26:13.690 --> 26:16.689
- Really? Thank you.
- Yeah. Of course, it's my pleasure.

26:16.690 --> 26:18.689
Thanks, Jeffrey. You're
a man amongst men.

26:18.690 --> 26:19.690
Thanks, Miles.

26:20.690 --> 26:22.689
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?

26:22.690 --> 26:24.689
Mom said you're making a movie.

26:24.690 --> 26:26.689
- I am.
- Wait. Like, a real movie?

26:26.690 --> 26:29.690
What other kind is there?

26:30.690 --> 26:32.689
Yeah, who, who gave you the job?

26:32.690 --> 26:34.689
I gave it to myself.

26:34.690 --> 26:37.689
- You can do that?
- Apparently, I can.

26:37.690 --> 26:38.689
Well, what's it about?

26:38.690 --> 26:40.689
Yeah, yeah. I'm, I'm curious, too.

26:40.690 --> 26:42.689
Well, maybe we should order first, huh?

26:42.690 --> 26:44.689
You know my friend
Liliana was in a movie once

26:44.690 --> 26:46.689
when she lived in Arizona.

26:46.690 --> 26:49.689
She pretended to talk to people
in the background and made $50.

26:49.690 --> 26:51.689
Oh, Emma, if there was a
role for you in this movie,

26:51.690 --> 26:53.689
- believe me, you'd be...
- Would you flag down the waitress?

26:53.690 --> 26:55.689
- Oh, there she is.
- Ma'am?

26:55.690 --> 26:57.689
- Excuse me?
- She...

26:57.690 --> 27:00.689
You know what? There
is a part, actually.

27:00.690 --> 27:04.689
Oh! There's this girl,
younger, your age.

27:04.695 --> 27:11.265
She's sharp. She's kinda quick-witted.
Bit cheeky. You could totally play her.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.689
- Wait, really?
- Emma. You'd be spot-on.

27:13.690 --> 27:15.689
Okay. Hold on.

27:15.690 --> 27:16.690
What does the character do in the film?

27:18.690 --> 27:20.689
It's a small part, Jeffrey,

27:20.685 --> 27:25.684
but, uh, it's, uh,
pivotal to the narrative.

27:25.690 --> 27:28.582
It's kind of... It's hard to explain if

27:28.629 --> 27:30.689
you don't know the story, but it's good.

27:30.690 --> 27:32.689
When, exactly, would this happen?

27:32.690 --> 27:33.689
During the summer.

27:33.690 --> 27:36.689
I told you, we made plans.

27:36.690 --> 27:41.689
Golf camp! Oh, I totally
forgot, I'm sorry.

27:41.690 --> 27:43.689
No, no, no. Mom, I'd rather
be in a movie. Mom, please.

27:43.690 --> 27:46.689
Oh, but you probably don't want
to disappoint the country club.

27:46.690 --> 27:47.689
Maybe you could visit the set.

27:47.690 --> 27:50.689
Can she visit the set, maybe,
for a day or two? How about that?

27:50.690 --> 27:52.689
It's not as good as being in it.

27:52.690 --> 27:55.689
You know what? It would be
a pretty amazing opportunity.

27:55.690 --> 27:56.689
- Jeffrey.
- Sorry.

27:56.690 --> 27:58.689
Why don't we eat.

27:58.690 --> 28:01.689
And then we can discuss this when
Daddy has actual dates for the film.

28:01.690 --> 28:03.690
Yeah. Let's discuss it later.

28:07.690 --> 28:09.690
Enchiladas look good.

28:16.690 --> 28:18.689
There he is!

28:18.690 --> 28:20.183
All right, all right. I'm okay.

28:20.199 --> 28:23.689
Can I, uh, wha... What
do you need me to do?

28:23.690 --> 28:24.689
Get off me, God damn it!

28:24.690 --> 28:25.689
Can I help you?

28:25.690 --> 28:27.689
- No. I got it.
- Yeah. You got it. There you go.

28:27.690 --> 28:28.689
Get off me!

28:28.690 --> 28:30.690
Sit. Sit down. Sit down.

28:31.690 --> 28:32.689
Sit right down. Beautiful.

28:32.690 --> 28:34.689
All right. Okay.

28:34.690 --> 28:35.690
Thank you, Amy.

28:37.690 --> 28:39.689
- Look at her, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

28:39.690 --> 28:42.689
When I started, she was a teenager.

28:42.690 --> 28:45.689
First movie I made, about giant spiders.

28:45.690 --> 28:49.689
Oh, yeah. She says you're
looking for a line producer.

28:49.690 --> 28:54.689
I'm a little bit out of the loop,
but I could, I could do some research.

28:54.690 --> 28:55.690
I want you to do it, Eugene.

28:58.690 --> 28:59.689
- What?
- Yeah.

28:59.690 --> 29:03.689
Yeah. Get back in the action,
huh? Boost up the savings account.

29:03.690 --> 29:05.689
I can't make it across the room.

29:05.690 --> 29:08.689
No. Look. We get you an office, phone.

29:08.690 --> 29:11.689
You gotta go to the
set, the PA brings you.

29:11.690 --> 29:14.689
What the hell do you want me for?

29:14.690 --> 29:17.689
I'm paying guys under the
table and nobody wants the gig.

29:17.690 --> 29:20.689
But this is... For you
it's perfect, right?

29:20.690 --> 29:22.689
It doesn't screw with
your health benefits.

29:22.690 --> 29:25.689
We get Vittorio Storaro as DP.

29:25.690 --> 29:27.689
Vittorio Storaro?

29:27.690 --> 29:29.689
The man won an Academy Award
for Apocalypse Now.

29:29.690 --> 29:31.689
In '79. Right? What's he done lately?

29:31.690 --> 29:35.689
We can, we can crew this
whole project with legends.

29:35.690 --> 29:38.689
And pay their rate.

29:38.690 --> 29:43.689
Their rate as of 20 years
ago or adjusted for inflation?

29:43.690 --> 29:46.690
I'm providing a service for the
elderly, you gonna argue about inflation?

29:48.690 --> 29:51.689
How about Charlie Grimes as UPM?

29:51.690 --> 29:55.690
Well, I think he's dead, but
I'll, I'll give him a call.

29:56.690 --> 29:58.689
This is gonna be great. Thank you.

29:58.690 --> 30:01.689
- Yeah.
- Wanna... You wanna wait for Amy?

30:01.690 --> 30:02.690
No, no. I got it.

30:03.690 --> 30:04.690
Amy!

30:29.690 --> 30:30.689
Hey, any luck?

30:30.690 --> 30:34.689
Hey. This lady, April?
All she does is work.

30:34.690 --> 30:36.689
There's no drugs. There's
not a joint in the place.

30:36.690 --> 30:37.689
Barely any booze.

30:37.690 --> 30:40.689
And there's nothing
X-rated on her computer.

30:40.690 --> 30:43.689
I have spent two hours
looking at fucking selfies.

30:43.690 --> 30:44.689
Is she seeing anyone?

30:44.690 --> 30:47.689
She had a guy come over last night,
but he's too young to be her boss.

30:47.690 --> 30:48.689
There's no pictures of
him in the apartment,

30:48.690 --> 30:50.689
so I think it was a booty call.

30:50.690 --> 30:52.689
She kicked him out 20 minutes later,

30:52.690 --> 30:54.689
She went back to work.

30:54.690 --> 30:57.689
Whoa. Here's something, maybe.

30:57.690 --> 30:58.689
What the hell is that?

30:58.690 --> 31:00.689
What are you looking at?

31:00.690 --> 31:02.689
A photo on her computer.

31:02.690 --> 31:04.689
- Jesus...
- Wait, you're in her place now?

31:04.690 --> 31:05.690
I gotta get a photo of this.

31:08.690 --> 31:11.690
Uh, listen, I'll call
you back, all right?

31:13.690 --> 31:15.689
Wait till you see this.

31:15.690 --> 31:16.690
This... I mean, it...

31:18.690 --> 31:19.690
Hello?

31:20.690 --> 31:22.689
What the fuck?

31:22.690 --> 31:23.690
Hello to you, too.

31:24.690 --> 31:26.689
You brought it to my apartment.

31:26.690 --> 31:28.689
You think that's wise?

31:28.690 --> 31:30.690
Well, if you want it,
you should invite me in.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.690
Come on in.

31:37.690 --> 31:40.689
So, this is where a guy lives

31:40.690 --> 31:44.689
when his wife kicks him out.

31:44.690 --> 31:46.689
Eh... This is pathetic shit.

31:46.690 --> 31:47.689
You wanna give me the cash?

31:47.690 --> 31:50.689
Aah, I like a little
conversation before I get fucked.

31:50.690 --> 31:51.689
Hmm?

31:51.690 --> 31:53.689
But, that's just me.

31:53.690 --> 31:54.689
Oh, good. You're high.

31:54.690 --> 31:56.689
And you're a smug little prick.

31:56.690 --> 32:00.689
Got Amara backing you up,
so you're the man. Hmm?

32:00.690 --> 32:05.689
Up in Hollywood, hmm? Making fun of me.

32:05.690 --> 32:07.689
You know, if it makes you feel better,

32:07.690 --> 32:08.690
I don't think about you at all.

32:11.690 --> 32:13.689
So, how is LA?

32:13.690 --> 32:15.689
I hear it's a dangerous place.

32:15.690 --> 32:17.689
You think that's true?

32:17.690 --> 32:19.690
Is that a threat?

32:20.690 --> 32:21.690
Was it?

32:24.690 --> 32:26.689
If something happens to me,

32:26.690 --> 32:28.689
Amara loses her investment.

32:28.690 --> 32:30.243
Now, if she loses two
million bucks, she's

32:30.249 --> 32:31.689
gonna wanna know who's responsible.

32:31.690 --> 32:34.690
I wonder, who do you think
she's gonna look at first?

32:43.690 --> 32:47.690
It's funny. I always forget
just how short you are.

32:58.690 --> 33:00.690
Hey, you see Amara,
tell her I said thanks.

33:18.690 --> 33:21.689
Hey. Hey, is that your car?

33:21.690 --> 33:23.689
- What?
- Is that your fucking juke?

33:23.690 --> 33:24.689
Yeah, am I blocking you in?

33:24.690 --> 33:26.689
What's it look like?

33:26.690 --> 33:28.689
Sorry.

33:28.690 --> 33:30.690
Bad enough you drive around
in that fuckin' thing.

33:31.690 --> 33:33.689
I said I was sorry. I'll it back up.

33:33.690 --> 33:34.690
Yeah, I'll back it up your ass.

33:35.690 --> 33:37.690
You need to relax.

33:38.690 --> 33:39.689
What?

33:40.690 --> 33:42.689
You know what?

33:42.690 --> 33:45.689
I'm gonna move my car for
you, but you could be polite.

33:45.690 --> 33:48.690
As in "please" and "thank
you." It goes a long way.

33:50.690 --> 33:52.689
Please. Hmm?

33:52.690 --> 33:54.689
Please, sir.

33:54.690 --> 33:56.689
Would you move your fucking
juke so that I can get out?

33:56.690 --> 33:58.689
Thank you so much.

33:58.690 --> 34:03.690
I really fucking appreciate it.

34:09.690 --> 34:11.688
You want me to relax. Huh?

34:11.690 --> 34:14.690
Okay, maybe I am a little tense. Huh?

34:16.690 --> 34:18.690
Here we go. Hmm.

34:21.690 --> 34:22.688
Open your mouth.

34:22.690 --> 34:24.690
- What?
- Ah.

34:25.690 --> 34:27.690
No! No. Please.

34:36.690 --> 34:39.688
Yeah. That feels good, right?

34:39.690 --> 34:42.688
Nice and relaxing. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

34:42.690 --> 34:45.688
Yago! Fucking Christ!

34:45.690 --> 34:47.688
- What?
- You don't...

34:47.690 --> 34:49.688
- He was talkin' shit.
- That's my wife's boyfriend.

34:49.690 --> 34:51.688
- What?
- Neighbors are probably calling the cops.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.688
Juke is blocking me in.

34:53.690 --> 34:55.688
You said that's your wife's boyfriend?

34:55.690 --> 34:57.689
Get in your car. I'll move him out.

34:59.690 --> 35:00.690
Go!

35:02.690 --> 35:07.690
Jeffrey? I need to move your
car. Can you give me your keys?

35:09.690 --> 35:11.690
Thank you.

35:12.690 --> 35:14.689
"The wild estate of the manor,

35:14.690 --> 35:17.689
"now a reminder of a more innocent time.

35:17.690 --> 35:20.689
"Track with Margaret,
walking to the cliffs.

35:20.690 --> 35:22.689
"Camera rises up.

35:22.690 --> 35:27.690
"As the sun sets on the day,
and on a lifetime of regret.

35:30.690 --> 35:31.690
"The end."

35:32.690 --> 35:34.689
The end?

35:34.690 --> 35:35.689
Well, she's angry because she thinks...

35:35.690 --> 35:37.689
She's not angry.

35:37.690 --> 35:42.689
She's gonna kill herself
because her heart, it's breaking.

35:42.690 --> 35:45.689
- Why?
- The family made her marry that man.

35:45.690 --> 35:47.689
Lord Sheridan.

35:47.690 --> 35:48.689
Yeah. The Lord.

35:48.690 --> 35:50.689
But she doesn't love him.

35:50.690 --> 35:51.689
Well, it was an arranged marriage.

35:51.690 --> 35:53.689
The Lord paid a dowry to her parents.

35:53.690 --> 35:55.689
And then the boy she loves,

35:55.690 --> 35:59.689
he comes back to her but it's too late.

35:59.690 --> 36:02.689
She has to marry the rich man.

36:02.690 --> 36:04.690
Si.

36:34.690 --> 36:35.690
It's sad.

36:38.690 --> 36:39.690
Si.

36:43.690 --> 36:44.689
Drink this.

36:44.690 --> 36:47.689
That guy was...

36:47.690 --> 36:49.690
He was... He was...

36:53.690 --> 36:54.689
Breathe. Breathe.

36:56.690 --> 36:58.689
That guy... You know him?

36:58.690 --> 37:00.689
Uh, he's a neighbor, I think.

37:00.690 --> 37:03.689
- He's got mental health issues.
- He was gonna kill me.

37:03.690 --> 37:04.689
I think he was just, uh, showing off.

37:04.690 --> 37:07.690
But, um, I'm sure it was scary.

37:08.690 --> 37:09.689
Sorry.

37:09.690 --> 37:11.689
Why are you sorry, Miles?

37:11.690 --> 37:14.690
You saved my life.

37:15.690 --> 37:16.689
Oh, fuck.

37:16.690 --> 37:19.689
Ah, I pissed my pants.
I ruined your couch.

37:19.690 --> 37:20.689
I'm sorry, I ruined your couch.

37:20.690 --> 37:21.689
It's a shitty old couch.
Don't worry about it.

37:21.690 --> 37:24.690
Listen, Jeffrey?

37:26.690 --> 37:29.689
I think its best you don't
tell anyone about this.

37:29.690 --> 37:31.689
Not even Katie. I mean,
she wouldn't tell anyone

37:31.690 --> 37:34.690
but, what if she did?

37:35.690 --> 37:37.690
You don't want that guy in your life.

37:40.690 --> 37:44.689
Crap. I'm not... I'm not
gonna tell Katie about this.

37:46.690 --> 37:48.690
What about the cut? Can she see the cut?

37:50.690 --> 37:51.690
Your hair covers it.

37:59.690 --> 38:03.689
I was driving over here and I
was... I was angry at my boss.

38:03.690 --> 38:06.689
'Cause he won't let
me run the fall tournament,

38:06.690 --> 38:11.689
and I was livid, like that was
the most important thing ever.

38:13.690 --> 38:15.689
And then two minutes
later, there's a maniac

38:15.690 --> 38:18.689
and he's gonna blow off my head.

38:18.690 --> 38:22.689
It puts things
into perspective, you know?

38:29.690 --> 38:30.690
It's Katie.

38:33.690 --> 38:35.689
I'm... I'm gonna talk to her tomorrow.

38:35.690 --> 38:36.690
I think that's probably best.

38:51.690 --> 38:52.689
- Am I late?
- No. No.

38:52.690 --> 38:55.689
You're... I mean, you're 12
minutes late, but its fine.

38:55.690 --> 38:57.689
How's your day so far?

38:57.690 --> 38:59.689
Crazy, but good crazy. I won't bore you.

38:59.690 --> 39:01.689
Please.

39:01.690 --> 39:04.689
Next week I scout locations
in the Grecian Isles.

39:04.690 --> 39:07.689
I know, right? We're
doing a month-long set piece.

39:07.690 --> 39:10.689
Speedboats, helicopters,
very large egos.

39:10.690 --> 39:12.689
Oh, you're right. That sounds boring.

39:15.690 --> 39:17.689
Do you wanna get a coffee... Inside?

39:17.690 --> 39:19.689
Uh, something I should run by you first.

39:19.690 --> 39:23.689
Thanks for meeting me, by the way.
You're obviously a very cool person.

39:23.690 --> 39:25.689
I think you're a cool person.

39:25.690 --> 39:27.690
Hmm. I'm about to ruin that.

39:28.690 --> 39:29.689
Oh, please, don't pitch anything.

39:29.690 --> 39:31.689
I'm not gonna pitch anything.

39:31.690 --> 39:32.690
Open this.

39:33.690 --> 39:35.690
Don't let anyone else see.

39:36.690 --> 39:38.689
Wow. So mysterious.

39:45.690 --> 39:46.689
Where did you get this?

39:46.690 --> 39:48.690
I had someone break into your place.

39:51.690 --> 39:54.689
Careful or I'll think you're serious.

39:54.690 --> 39:55.690
I am serious.

39:58.690 --> 40:00.689
He broke a little
window in your back door.

40:00.690 --> 40:03.689
You probably haven't noticed it, but
you should definitely get it fixed.

40:03.690 --> 40:04.690
And I'll pay for that.

40:07.690 --> 40:11.689
The good news is, I'm not gonna
show that picture to anyone.

40:11.690 --> 40:15.690
Not as long as your studio
produces my film for $30 million.

40:27.690 --> 40:30.689
This photo? Is seven years old.

40:30.690 --> 40:35.689
And it was taken at a
costume party, on Halloween.

40:35.690 --> 40:38.689
That's the point of a costume party.

40:38.690 --> 40:40.689
You dress in a fucking costume.

40:40.690 --> 40:44.689
And Oprah is the reason
I got into show business.

40:44.690 --> 40:46.689
She's an inspiration.

40:46.690 --> 40:47.690
I believe you.

40:50.690 --> 40:52.689
Blackface isn't offensive in Ontario.

40:52.690 --> 40:55.690
April. It is here.

41:01.690 --> 41:02.690
My number's on the cover.

41:04.690 --> 41:06.690
"Moreweather Productions"?

41:08.690 --> 41:09.689
Rick Moreweather?

41:09.690 --> 41:11.690
He's helping me produce.

41:15.690 --> 41:20.689
Uh, well, you can tell
Rick that there is no way

41:20.690 --> 41:23.689
I convince Brandon to make this film.

41:23.690 --> 41:28.689
- Not in a million years...
- Ms. Quinn, this is a beautiful story.

41:28.690 --> 41:31.689
It's honest and it's real and
I promise when you read it,

41:31.690 --> 41:35.689
you'll realize you would've
wanted to make this movie anyway.

41:35.690 --> 41:39.690
If you don't, I'll ruin you.
I'll ruin your fuckin' life.

41:43.690 --> 41:45.689
But it won't come to that,

41:45.690 --> 41:48.690
because you're a go-getter, and
this is a lovely piece of writing.

41:52.690 --> 41:53.689
I'm gonna go now.

41:53.690 --> 41:56.690
I feel like the coffee
date's a bit awkward.

41:59.690 --> 42:01.499
But I'm excited to work with you.

42:02.690 --> 42:03.690
Let's talk soon.

42:24.690 --> 42:25.689
Okay, that's it, right? Where are we?

42:25.690 --> 42:27.689
- Sound.
- Sound, Zach Schaffer.

42:27.690 --> 42:28.689
"A" camera...

42:28.690 --> 42:31.689
Sam Connell, who actually
worked on Gunsmoke.

42:31.690 --> 42:33.689
- Can you believe that?
- I do.

42:33.690 --> 42:34.690
Hello!

42:35.690 --> 42:36.690
Hello!

42:38.690 --> 42:40.689
April. Hi! What...

42:40.690 --> 42:43.689
Wanted you to know I am going to
the police tomorrow to press charges.

42:43.690 --> 42:45.689
You no-talent, valley piece of shit!

42:45.690 --> 42:48.689
- I'll be at my desk.
- What're you talkin' about?

42:48.690 --> 42:49.689
I thought I was the one mad at you.

42:49.690 --> 42:51.689
- For what?
- For tankin' my movie.

42:51.690 --> 42:54.689
- Oh. That's what this is about?
- What?

42:54.690 --> 42:56.689
I thought to myself, why
would Rick target me, huh?

42:56.690 --> 42:59.689
Because I got a job in a real office?

42:59.690 --> 43:01.689
When this one looks like a sick
cat who stopped grooming itself?

43:01.690 --> 43:04.689
Hello, April. I don't know what
the hell you're talkin' about.

43:04.690 --> 43:07.689
Bullshit! And blackmail is a felony.

43:07.690 --> 43:09.689
- Blackmail?
- What would you call it?

43:09.690 --> 43:14.689
I'm not blackmailing
you. I've never blackmailed anybody.

43:14.690 --> 43:16.689
Uh, what? That distributor
thing, that was not blackmail.

43:16.690 --> 43:18.690
Your ex-wife.

43:19.690 --> 43:21.689
Minor blackmail. Justified.

43:21.690 --> 43:24.689
Tomorrow I'm going to Brandon,
I'm gonna tell him everything.

43:24.690 --> 43:26.689
He knows me, he'll give me
the benefit of the doubt.

43:26.690 --> 43:28.689
Zero idea what you're talking about.

43:28.690 --> 43:31.689
And then I'm going fucking police, okay?

43:31.690 --> 43:34.194
So you and Miles can have fun producing

43:34.217 --> 43:35.689
your Georgian romance at San Quentin.

43:35.690 --> 43:38.689
- Miles?
- Have a nice life, Rick.

43:38.690 --> 43:39.690
I'll see you in 10 to 20.

43:45.690 --> 43:46.690
You okay?

43:47.690 --> 43:51.689
Yeah. No, no, no, not really.

43:51.690 --> 43:52.690
Get Miles on the phone.

43:55.690 --> 43:56.689
It's okay. All right, hold...

43:56.690 --> 43:58.690
Step out, Leo, let me show you.

44:01.690 --> 44:03.689
I'm gonna relax and focus.

44:03.690 --> 44:05.689
Remember, I wanna use my body

44:05.690 --> 44:08.690
to power the swing
and not my arms. Okay?

44:09.690 --> 44:10.689
Take a nice deep breath.

44:10.690 --> 44:13.690
Remember, grip, hip and rip.

44:16.690 --> 44:18.689
Ha! Okay. Well, see?

44:18.690 --> 44:21.689
Even I get a miss-hit from time
to time. So that when I do...

44:21.690 --> 44:23.689
I'm gonna... I'm just
gonna go back to basics.

44:23.690 --> 44:25.689
I'm gonna take a nice, deep breath,

44:25.690 --> 44:28.689
going to, uh, make sure
that I get a 45-degree angle

44:28.690 --> 44:30.690
to my left arm and the club shaft.

44:33.690 --> 44:34.690
And then, grip, hip, rip.

44:36.690 --> 44:39.689
What the hell!

44:39.690 --> 44:40.689
All right.

44:40.690 --> 44:42.690
All right.

44:47.690 --> 44:49.689
Son of a...

44:51.690 --> 44:52.690
That doesn't happen.

45:02.690 --> 45:04.689
This is where we're havin' meetings now?

45:04.690 --> 45:06.689
Yeah. Well, this won't take long.

45:06.690 --> 45:07.689
Got a message from April Quinn.

45:07.690 --> 45:09.689
What?

45:09.690 --> 45:12.689
She's going to the cops.

45:12.690 --> 45:16.689
It's all there minus a non-refundable
cash advance to some crew members.

45:16.690 --> 45:18.689
- That's the cost of doing business.
- What happened with April?

45:18.690 --> 45:20.689
You tell me. No, don't. Don't.

45:20.690 --> 45:22.689
Less I know the better.

45:22.690 --> 45:24.689
All right, let's not panic.
Here, listen there's no way...

45:24.690 --> 45:26.689
Rick, Rick, listen.

45:26.690 --> 45:30.689
People in her position,
they never go to the cops.

45:30.690 --> 45:31.690
Oh, she's goin'.

45:34.690 --> 45:36.689
Okay. Okay, fine.

45:36.690 --> 45:38.689
You wanna make the film
for cheap? Let's do it.

45:38.690 --> 45:42.689
Lots of good movies were made that way,
Rocky, uh, Mad Max, the uh...

45:42.690 --> 45:43.689
- That Blair Witch thing.
- Uh, the Blair Witch thing.

45:43.690 --> 45:47.689
You think I wanna quit
the project? I don't!

45:47.690 --> 45:49.689
I got us a cutting-edge crew.

45:49.690 --> 45:52.689
I ain't going to prison
for a fucking period film.

45:52.690 --> 45:56.689
And if this is how you do
business, you're not my people!

45:56.690 --> 46:01.689
Listen, April will cool
off, Rick. We all will.

46:01.690 --> 46:03.690
And then we'll make a
fucking movie together, man.

46:04.690 --> 46:06.690
Rick! Rick!

46:14.690 --> 46:16.690
Cunt! Fuck!

46:19.690 --> 46:20.689
- Okay.
- Ah...

46:20.690 --> 46:24.689
For your sake and mine,
we gotta get out of town.

46:24.690 --> 46:27.689
And we're gonna pay back every
penny to Amara with interest.

46:27.690 --> 46:30.689
- Yeah, I'm not leaving.
- The cops could roll up any minute.

46:30.690 --> 46:32.689
She's not gonna call
the fucking cops, Lou.

46:32.690 --> 46:35.690
Maybe she already has!

46:41.690 --> 46:44.689
- It's Katie.
- Don't answer that.

46:44.690 --> 46:46.689
- Do...
- Hey.

46:46.690 --> 46:49.689
Well, so much for golf camp.

46:49.690 --> 46:51.689
- What?
- Like you're surprised.

46:51.690 --> 46:54.689
But I want exact dates and I
wanna know where Emma's gonna stay,

46:54.690 --> 46:56.690
what she's doing when
you're not filming, all that.

46:57.690 --> 46:58.689
Actually, uh...

46:58.690 --> 47:01.689
Here, she wants to talk to you.

47:01.690 --> 47:04.689
Told Denise I was gonna be
in a movie, she freaked out.

47:04.690 --> 47:05.689
Hey, shorty.

47:05.690 --> 47:07.689
Hey, when can I read it?

47:07.690 --> 47:10.689
Let's, um... Let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

47:10.690 --> 47:13.690
Uh, once I have the shooting
dates, I'll... I'll tell you.

47:15.690 --> 47:17.690
Are you sure I'm good enough?

47:19.690 --> 47:21.689
I'm more than sure.

47:21.690 --> 47:24.689
But, uh, sweetheart, it's
not a great time right now.

47:24.690 --> 47:25.689
Can I call you back tomorrow?

47:25.690 --> 47:27.690
- Okay. Good night.
- Night-night.

47:30.690 --> 47:31.690
Hey!

47:51.690 --> 47:52.690
Thanks for coming.

47:53.690 --> 47:54.689
How's Edna?

47:54.690 --> 47:57.690
She's good. Thanks for asking.

48:00.690 --> 48:02.689
Did you talk to Mexico?

48:02.690 --> 48:04.689
They wanna keep business smooth.

48:04.690 --> 48:09.689
What happened between you and me,
I told 'em we put it behind us.

48:09.690 --> 48:11.690
But you got the Feds watching you.

48:12.690 --> 48:13.689
So?

48:13.690 --> 48:17.689
They want you to back
off until things cool off.

48:17.690 --> 48:20.689
I'll handle the territory
north of Indian Springs.

48:20.690 --> 48:24.689
I'll kick back 30%. That's fair.

48:24.690 --> 48:27.689
Feds can watch you all
day, they get nothing.

48:27.690 --> 48:31.690
When they stop watching, I
give everything back to you.

48:32.690 --> 48:33.690
It's best for everyone.

48:47.690 --> 48:49.689
"It's best for everyone."

48:49.690 --> 48:51.690
So, you agree?

48:55.690 --> 48:59.690
Me and Josias, we fuck one time.

49:02.690 --> 49:04.690
He's this big.

49:06.690 --> 49:07.690
It's very sad.

49:09.690 --> 49:13.690
You think you walk over
me because I am a woman?

49:15.690 --> 49:18.689
You little dick maricon.

49:18.690 --> 49:22.689
You have one hour to go back up north

49:22.690 --> 49:25.690
or I cut your fucking legs off.

50:19.690 --> 50:22.541
_

50:47.690 --> 50:49.689
I was talking to
Frank Ellmonds. You know Frank.

50:49.690 --> 50:53.689
Told him he had to read what you
said in The Hollywood Reporter.

50:53.690 --> 50:56.689
I said, "Frank, listen, she
hit the nail right on the head."

50:56.690 --> 50:59.689
Turns out, he was on his way
to meet with Abby in sales.

50:59.690 --> 51:01.689
- Who just told him the...
- Can I just...

51:01.690 --> 51:03.689
Uh, sorry.

51:03.690 --> 51:05.689
It's okay.

51:05.690 --> 51:06.689
Yeah, I... There's just...

51:06.690 --> 51:10.689
There's something I've
been putting off saying

51:10.690 --> 51:15.690
and I should really just, you know,
throw it on out there.

51:16.690 --> 51:17.690
Okay.

51:19.690 --> 51:20.690
Okay.

51:22.690 --> 51:26.690
You know me. The kind of person I am.

51:28.690 --> 51:32.690
So I can be honest with you about...

51:38.690 --> 51:39.690
About...

51:42.690 --> 51:43.690
About?

51:47.258 --> 51:48.690
April?

51:50.690 --> 51:52.690
We need a prestige picture.

51:57.690 --> 51:58.689
- Yeah?
- Of course it's important

51:58.690 --> 52:01.689
to develop a franchise.

52:01.690 --> 52:04.689
But now and then, we need
a traditional period drama

52:04.690 --> 52:07.689
with crossover appeal and awards buzz.

52:07.690 --> 52:09.689
I know you agree.

52:09.690 --> 52:13.689
Yeah. To attract serious filmmakers
and for the sake of our brand.

52:13.690 --> 52:16.689
We already have that, don't we?

52:16.690 --> 52:18.689
The Le Carre Bleu...
The Silent Footstep.

52:18.690 --> 52:20.689
That's a best-selling novel.

52:20.690 --> 52:24.690
Have you heard of The
Admiral's Mistress?

52:26.690 --> 52:28.689
Remind me.

52:28.690 --> 52:33.689
A Georgian romance set
against Napoleonic wars.

52:33.690 --> 52:36.689
It has heart-breaking romance.

52:36.690 --> 52:38.689
Social commentary.

52:38.690 --> 52:44.689
It will set the standard for
cultural and intellectual drama.

52:44.690 --> 52:47.689
- The Admiral's...
- Mistress.

52:47.690 --> 52:50.689
It has a lot of buzz already.

52:50.690 --> 52:53.689
Not even... I don't...
Not a lot just, uh, a ton.

52:53.690 --> 52:56.690
There's so much buzz going around

52:57.690 --> 53:01.690
and I can't promise
anything, but if we act fast,

53:03.690 --> 53:04.690
there's a chance we could get it.

53:07.690 --> 53:09.690
So can I give you the script?

53:23.690 --> 53:26.689
We know you're in there, Rick.
You parked your fucking car outside.

53:26.690 --> 53:28.690
Holy shit.

53:29.690 --> 53:32.690
Okay, I'm not talkin' to you anymore.

53:34.690 --> 53:36.689
Okay? This relationship is...

53:36.690 --> 53:38.689
Don't come... What are you...

53:38.690 --> 53:40.689
- Okay, now that's trespassing.
- Morning, Rick.

53:40.690 --> 53:42.689
No, no.

53:42.690 --> 53:44.689
Got some news to share with you.

53:44.690 --> 53:46.689
I told you, I don't want
anything to do with...

53:46.690 --> 53:48.690
Listen. The studio's in.

53:49.690 --> 53:51.689
Yeah, right.

53:51.690 --> 53:53.689
We're meeting with the head
of, uh, Gravity Pictures in...

53:53.690 --> 53:55.689
- What is it?
- Thirty-six minutes.

53:55.690 --> 53:58.690
Thirty-six minutes. You're invited.

54:01.690 --> 54:03.689
You're meeting with Brandon Fisher?

54:03.690 --> 54:04.689
- I think uh...
- Hmm. That was his name.

54:04.690 --> 54:06.690
- Yeah, Brandon. Yeah, that's it.
- I believe that's his name.

54:08.690 --> 54:10.690
So April folded?

54:12.690 --> 54:14.689
Okay, well, you, you got the studio.

54:14.690 --> 54:16.689
What are you coming to me for?

54:16.690 --> 54:18.689
Wouldn't be the same without you.

54:18.690 --> 54:21.690
Yeah. Yeah. You want me to...

54:23.690 --> 54:27.690
You want me to hide the cash,
okay? Forget about it. No way!

54:29.690 --> 54:30.689
Suit yourself.

54:30.690 --> 54:33.689
Yeah. Okay. I already told you.

54:33.690 --> 54:36.689
I... I know what you people do so...

54:36.690 --> 54:41.689
You think I would work with you people?

54:41.690 --> 54:45.690
I'm a professional
with a reputation, okay?

54:52.690 --> 54:54.690
- It's so white.
- It is.

54:57.690 --> 54:59.690
Now, how do they keep it clean?

55:00.690 --> 55:02.690
Can't be easy.

55:06.690 --> 55:10.689
I've never seen trees used
for decoration like that.

55:10.690 --> 55:11.689
- Have you?
- No.

55:11.690 --> 55:13.689
I mean, look at that. It's like they...

55:13.690 --> 55:15.690
Do they cut it or...

55:16.690 --> 55:17.690
This is us.

55:23.690 --> 55:26.689
Look at these two heavy
hitters. Fantastic.

55:26.690 --> 55:29.689
Brandon, this is our
producer, Miles Daly.

55:29.690 --> 55:30.690
Hello!

55:31.690 --> 55:33.689
Um, and, uh, this is...

55:33.690 --> 55:35.690
Our writer, Louis Darnell.

55:36.690 --> 55:37.689
Louis, such a pleasure.

55:37.690 --> 55:41.689
Sorry, guys. Phew! Busy, busy morning.

55:41.690 --> 55:44.689
Brandon, it's been a while, huh?

55:44.690 --> 55:46.689
- Rick Moreweather.
- Yeah.

55:46.690 --> 55:48.689
Yeah, producer.

55:48.690 --> 55:49.689
Fantastic.

55:49.690 --> 55:50.689
Let me tell you something...

55:50.690 --> 55:53.689
When I got this script,
first thing I thought was

55:53.690 --> 55:56.689
there's only one executive that
we would wanna partner with.

55:56.690 --> 55:58.689
One. That's it. April Quinn.

55:58.690 --> 56:00.689
Mmm-hmm. He picked me.

56:00.690 --> 56:03.689
Well, she's passionate about it.

56:03.690 --> 56:04.690
Emotional.

56:06.690 --> 56:10.689
I feel chemistry going on here.

56:10.690 --> 56:12.689
The secret to this studio?

56:12.690 --> 56:14.689
Talented people who
love working together.

56:14.690 --> 56:16.689
Hmm.

56:16.690 --> 56:17.689
Exciting.

56:19.690 --> 56:22.689
And this right here, this is
only the beginning.

57:06.690 --> 57:08.690
Fuck!
