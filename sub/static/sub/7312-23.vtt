WEBVTT

00:03.525 --> 00:05.135
[thunder rumbles]

00:26.069 --> 00:27.723
Boss, I found some
other shell casings.

00:29.986 --> 00:31.988
Looks like the
blood trail was...

00:32.032 --> 00:33.729
washed away
by the rain.

00:33.772 --> 00:35.383
McGEE:
Tony!

00:47.482 --> 00:49.527
All right, Mr. Palmer,
on "three."

00:49.571 --> 00:53.096
DUCKY:
One... two...

00:53.140 --> 00:54.228
DUCKY & PALMER:
...three.

00:55.881 --> 00:59.102
I'll secure
and you drive.
Yes, Doc.

00:59.146 --> 01:01.539
Better catch
me up, probie.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.585
I'm lost.

01:08.720 --> 01:10.418
So am I.

02:02.992 --> 02:05.386
I don't understand.

02:07.997 --> 02:10.086
[sighs]:
Makes no sense.

02:17.963 --> 02:19.661
Tell me.

02:19.704 --> 02:21.576
Start at the beginning.

02:25.493 --> 02:28.017
GIBBS:
Yesterday was beautiful.

02:31.499 --> 02:33.457
Were you preparing
for a monsoon?

02:33.501 --> 02:35.807
Forecast calls for rain.

02:35.851 --> 02:37.113
Spring rain?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.594
Heavyrain.

02:39.637 --> 02:41.161
What's your source?

02:41.204 --> 02:43.206
It's that weather app
that you told me to download.

02:43.250 --> 02:44.599
It's awesome.

02:44.642 --> 02:48.907
Wait-- is that a trick?
Did you put a fake app

02:48.951 --> 02:51.388
on my phone?It is pretty clever.

02:51.432 --> 02:54.217
It is. And I think a little
too clever for you.

02:54.261 --> 02:57.481
Then again, I do operate
on a higher plane.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.701
Well, you definitely operate
with your head in the clouds.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.006
Storm clouds?

03:03.487 --> 03:05.228
We'll see.

03:05.272 --> 03:07.883
Yes.

03:07.926 --> 03:10.799
See? Are you going
to believe what you read?

03:10.842 --> 03:12.888
Or what's rightin
front of your eyes?

03:12.931 --> 03:14.585
Morning, boss.

03:14.629 --> 03:16.805
Yeah. Real good morning.

03:16.848 --> 03:17.936
TONY:
Gonna rain later.

03:17.980 --> 03:18.981
No, it's not.

03:20.374 --> 03:21.592
Well...

03:21.636 --> 03:23.986
Ain't this usually
when you tell 'em

03:24.029 --> 03:26.597
where the body is
and off you go?

03:26.641 --> 03:28.556
No case?

03:28.599 --> 03:30.558
No. There's a case.

03:31.820 --> 03:32.908
Just not ours.

03:33.822 --> 03:34.823
Gear up.

03:38.087 --> 03:40.611
Damn! Where'd they
come from?

03:42.396 --> 03:44.528
Mmm, Spain, Australia.

03:44.572 --> 03:47.009
Most recently, Hawaii.

03:47.052 --> 03:49.533
Where we goin', E.J.?Virginia.

03:49.577 --> 03:52.101
Body. Dead at least
several weeks.

03:52.144 --> 03:54.669
Who?Identified to be
an NCIS agent.

03:58.150 --> 04:01.110
You're not gonna just
let that go, are you?

04:02.633 --> 04:04.113
[sighs]

04:08.987 --> 04:11.163
What are you waiting for?
It's an NCIS Special Agent.

04:12.556 --> 04:15.080
It's going to rain.

04:15.124 --> 04:20.172
LEVIN: A white male, mid-30s,
throat cleanly slashed.

04:20.216 --> 04:21.826
No wallet,
no keys,

04:21.870 --> 04:23.524
nothing on
the body.

04:23.567 --> 04:26.657
Fingerprint scan confirms
Virginia PD's I.D.

04:26.701 --> 04:29.486
It is NCIS Special Agent
Earl Stark.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.271
On annual leave from Norfolk.

04:31.314 --> 04:34.578
No plastic wrap?
No ties?

04:34.622 --> 04:36.058
No souvenir?

04:40.541 --> 04:41.846
How can we help?

04:41.890 --> 04:43.283
Canvass.

04:43.326 --> 04:44.980
Got it.

04:51.508 --> 04:52.204
FRANKS:
Who's the chippy?

04:54.598 --> 04:57.253
Vance's new golden girl.

04:57.297 --> 05:00.909
Her and DiNozzo
making sheet music?

05:00.952 --> 05:02.998
Mm-hmm.

05:03.041 --> 05:05.261
Please.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.569
He's taking a page
outta your songbook.
[laughs]

05:08.612 --> 05:11.963
FRANKS:
Like you'd pass up a duet
with a lady like that.

05:12.007 --> 05:14.488
Who outranks him, to boot.

05:14.531 --> 05:18.013
Well, she outranks me, too.

05:18.056 --> 05:21.669
Got lead in the hunt
for a serial killer.

05:21.712 --> 05:24.933
This body his?

05:24.976 --> 05:26.848
BARRETT:
Seems the Port-to-Port
Killer's M.O.

05:26.891 --> 05:28.850
has been evolving.

05:28.893 --> 05:30.504
TONY:
Based on what you found
in Hawaii?

05:30.547 --> 05:32.114
Think that
was a miss.

05:32.157 --> 05:34.116
Wow. You guys
came up empty, huh?

05:34.159 --> 05:35.552
No, he did.

05:35.596 --> 05:38.773
We suspect his target was
Sergeant Kevin Jericho.

05:38.816 --> 05:40.296
We met him at
the hospital.

05:40.340 --> 05:42.342
A survivor.

05:42.385 --> 05:45.301
Well, it's better
than the morgue.

05:45.345 --> 05:48.609
Jericho had just
been transferred from
Norfolk to Pearl Harbor.

05:48.652 --> 05:51.655
So we tracked him down
and failed to kill him?

05:51.699 --> 05:52.874
Someone
intervened.

05:52.917 --> 05:54.441
Saved Sergeant
Jericho's life,

05:54.484 --> 05:56.443
but lost his own
eyeball for the trouble.

05:56.486 --> 05:58.009
Did you tell
the good Samaritan

05:58.053 --> 06:00.055
we're holding onto
his eyeball for him?

06:00.098 --> 06:02.057
Would if I could,
but only Jericho

06:02.100 --> 06:03.711
was there when we
got to the hospital.

06:03.754 --> 06:05.365
A failure for P2P.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.192
First sign this
guy's human.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.549
He's not human, Tony.

06:29.780 --> 06:31.782
Look at the
blade work.

06:31.826 --> 06:33.654
He may as well be
signing his victims.

06:35.525 --> 06:37.962
The Port-to-Port Killer
is back in town.

06:38.006 --> 06:40.225
And he's targeting our own.

06:48.538 --> 06:52.194
What's on your mind?

06:55.502 --> 06:57.721
You're awfully quiet
over there, Duck.

06:57.765 --> 07:00.463
A mute swan, actually...

07:00.507 --> 07:02.639
believe it
or not.

07:02.683 --> 07:05.207
I believe it.
Legend has it

07:05.250 --> 07:09.167
that Cygnus olor
is silent

07:09.211 --> 07:11.822
for most of its life,

07:11.866 --> 07:15.826
until the moment of its death,
when it sings only once.

07:15.870 --> 07:18.481
[heavy sigh]

07:18.525 --> 07:20.701
When's a swan know
he's about to die?

07:20.744 --> 07:22.920
Ooh, some animals just know.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.706
When the endis near.

07:27.359 --> 07:29.405
True.

07:29.449 --> 07:33.583
This rangy mutt came by
my shack several years ago.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.542
Decided he was
gonna live with me.

07:35.585 --> 07:39.502
Barely a tooth
left in his mug,

07:39.546 --> 07:41.765
but he could still crunch
a soup bone to nothing.

07:44.638 --> 07:47.031
[whispers]:
Yeah.

07:47.075 --> 07:49.425
One mornin'...

07:49.469 --> 07:52.559
this plug-ugly beast

07:52.602 --> 07:54.778
staggers onto the beach,

07:54.822 --> 07:56.737
takes himself for a walk.

07:56.780 --> 07:59.261
I could see him
from the porch,

07:59.304 --> 08:01.263
barking out at the ocean.

08:01.306 --> 08:05.049
He turns around,
digs a hole in the sand,

08:05.093 --> 08:08.488
curls up in it and went off
to meet his maker.

08:14.232 --> 08:17.540
I know that you and Palmer
gotta get to work.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.847
We can wait.

08:19.890 --> 08:22.066
When you're ready.

08:27.419 --> 08:31.032
FRANKS:
We're all animals, probie.

08:31.075 --> 08:33.904
Where was I?

08:36.820 --> 08:39.301
...so, you understand me?

08:39.344 --> 08:41.390
You send everything
you got, okay?

08:46.090 --> 08:49.659
Special Agent Stark's
supervisor in Norfolk.

08:51.182 --> 08:53.228
E.J.'s team is
trying to sort out

08:53.271 --> 08:56.797
a discrepancy in
the security logs.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.626
Dr. Mallard estimates
Stark's death

08:59.669 --> 09:01.628
around 20 days ago.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.760
That's during
his annual leave.But our internals

09:03.804 --> 09:07.459
show him accessing the building
on multiple occasions

09:07.503 --> 09:09.157
in the past
couple of weeks.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.464
This building.

09:12.508 --> 09:13.944
Here.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.946
His I.D., at least.

09:15.990 --> 09:20.081
He's authorized because he was
assigned here briefly last year.

09:20.124 --> 09:22.344
Director Vance, I know that
Special Agent Barrett

09:22.387 --> 09:23.911
is leading this investigation...

09:23.954 --> 09:26.261
I'd like you to
support, Gibbs.

09:26.304 --> 09:27.915
Of course.

09:27.958 --> 09:30.221
Yes, sir, any way I can.

09:30.265 --> 09:33.616
Barrett's report from
the incident in Pearl.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.226
Follow up.

09:38.969 --> 09:40.710
BARRETT: Every single one
of P2P's prior victims

09:40.754 --> 09:42.973
were connected to the Navy.
Until Stark.

09:43.017 --> 09:46.281
The "N" in "NCIS"
does stand for "Naval."

09:46.324 --> 09:49.240
Maybe he's unaware
that we're civilian.

09:49.284 --> 09:52.809
No, if we assume he's stupid,
makes us look like imbeciles.

09:52.853 --> 09:56.508
If he killed Special Agent Stark
for his I.D.,

09:56.552 --> 09:59.424
he may be trying to get
very familiar with us.

09:59.468 --> 10:01.035
You're thinking
the discrepancies

10:01.078 --> 10:03.559
in the security log
are P2P himself

10:03.603 --> 10:05.996
accessing NCIS?
Yeah.

10:06.040 --> 10:09.347
Cade, pull up all
security-camera footage

10:09.391 --> 10:11.306
corresponding to Stark's
postmortem access times.

10:11.349 --> 10:13.177
Okay.

10:13.221 --> 10:15.702
If that's true, I wanna know
how he got through unnoticed.

10:15.745 --> 10:18.356
Levin...
I'm in the field
interviewing friends

10:18.400 --> 10:20.010
and associates.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.543
FRANKS:
They're reading.

10:31.587 --> 10:34.721
Barrett's report.

10:34.764 --> 10:36.679
You just wait for
them to finish?

10:36.723 --> 10:39.073
Yeah. Excruciating.

10:41.510 --> 10:44.295
Skip this part.

10:46.689 --> 10:49.431
Sergeant Kevin Jericho was
walking to his quarters

10:49.474 --> 10:51.868
at Pearl when a strange noise
drew him to an alleyway.

10:51.912 --> 10:54.349
It was a wind-up
teddy bear playing a drum.

10:54.392 --> 10:57.004
When Jericho examined it,
he was attacked from behind.

10:57.047 --> 10:58.527
He struggled,
suffered lacerations

10:58.570 --> 11:00.529
to his hands and neck.

11:00.572 --> 11:03.401
As he lost consciousness, he saw
a bald man drop into the alley.

11:03.445 --> 11:05.621
Much better.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.362
TONY: Crowd responded
to the screams.

11:07.405 --> 11:08.972
Must have scared off
the attacker.

11:09.016 --> 11:11.061
The bald man was admitted to
the hospital minus an eyeball.

11:11.105 --> 11:12.802
ZIVA:
Admission forms
give his name

11:12.846 --> 11:14.021
as Gavin O'Ryan.

11:14.064 --> 11:15.109
He disappeared
without being discharged.

11:15.152 --> 11:16.763
McGEE:
There are no records

11:16.806 --> 11:18.895
of a Gavin O'Ryan
residing in Hawaii.

11:18.939 --> 11:20.941
There are also no records
of a Gavin O'Ryan

11:20.984 --> 11:22.725
on any flight
in or out of Hawaii,

11:22.769 --> 11:24.509
surrounding the date
in question.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.511
I will go
enlist Abby's help

11:26.555 --> 11:27.599
to pursue
this further.

11:27.643 --> 11:28.905
TONY: I will pursue
the same mystery

11:28.949 --> 11:31.255
using "archaic"
and "old school" techniques.

11:31.299 --> 11:33.170
ZIVA: While pretending to have
a question for Ducky,

11:33.214 --> 11:34.737
I will follow Agent Barrett

11:34.781 --> 11:36.870
and accidentally
overhear

11:36.913 --> 11:38.915
details on her investigation.

11:43.746 --> 11:45.922
If only, huh?

11:45.966 --> 11:48.620
And what did you find
so interesting in all that?

11:48.664 --> 11:49.796
The teddy bear.

11:49.839 --> 11:50.840
That one's new.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.629
Seaman Derek Balfour.

11:57.673 --> 12:00.154
Sweet merciful crap, man.

12:00.197 --> 12:02.069
Am I really supposed to
remember all these names?

12:04.549 --> 12:08.510
Balfour was
the fifth victim overall.

12:08.553 --> 12:11.165
Believed ambushed
outside a D.C. nightclub.

12:11.208 --> 12:13.776
This is all garbage.

12:13.820 --> 12:15.865
GIBBS:
Yeah, mostly.

12:15.909 --> 12:17.737
Your team having
any better luck?

12:21.131 --> 12:23.568
Hard to operate
from second position.

12:23.612 --> 12:26.354
ZIVA: Gavin O'Ryan disappeared
without being discharged.

12:26.397 --> 12:28.051
McGEE: There's no record
of a Gavin O'Ryan

12:28.095 --> 12:29.923
on any flight out of Hawaii.

12:32.055 --> 12:34.666
Got some good news and
some bad news, boss.

12:34.710 --> 12:36.364
I checked every

12:36.407 --> 12:38.453
commercial, private,
military flight log there is.

12:38.496 --> 12:41.586
There's no way a Gavin
O'Ryan flew that day.

12:41.630 --> 12:43.327
But what if he used
multiple passports?

12:43.371 --> 12:44.546
Then who's got those?

12:44.589 --> 12:45.808
Don't speak.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.288
Spies.

12:47.331 --> 12:49.420
I see the wheels turning,
and you're thinking

12:49.464 --> 12:50.595
the same thing I'm thinking:

12:50.639 --> 12:52.293
the bald guy.

12:52.336 --> 12:54.817
Tony put a call in
to the hospital at Pearl.

12:54.861 --> 12:56.514
Sweet-talked the duty
nurse into giving me

12:56.558 --> 12:59.561
a detailed description of
the Cyclops Gavin O'Ryan.

12:59.604 --> 13:00.823
He had an accent.

13:00.867 --> 13:02.259
He barely spoke,

13:02.303 --> 13:04.087
and no one else
could confirm it, but...

13:04.131 --> 13:05.872
British.I knew your wheels
were turning.

13:05.915 --> 13:07.656
We already know his alias.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.179
I made a few calls.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.398
He's in town.

13:14.706 --> 13:16.230
Gavin.

13:16.273 --> 13:18.667
Long time, no see.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.800
Hello, DiNozzo.

13:20.843 --> 13:22.236
Oof.

13:31.549 --> 13:33.508
No coincidence
you were in Hawaii

13:33.551 --> 13:34.901
with the Port-to-Port Killer?

13:34.944 --> 13:36.685
I wasn't with him.

13:36.728 --> 13:38.295
I was pursuing him.

13:38.339 --> 13:40.907
Bang-up job you
did there, Kort.

13:40.950 --> 13:44.171
Can you walk
on this side, DiNozzo?

13:44.214 --> 13:47.870
Still getting used to
the limited peripheral vision.

13:47.914 --> 13:49.959
You know, flounders only have
eyes on one side of their head.

13:50.003 --> 13:51.831
Halibut, too.

13:51.874 --> 13:55.660
Think that's typical of most
bottom-feeding mud-suckers.

13:55.704 --> 13:58.185
Out of curiosity,
your eyeball--

13:58.228 --> 14:00.491
we're holding onto your
eyeball for you, by the way--

14:00.535 --> 14:03.016
how come it opens up
restricted areas at NCIS?

14:03.059 --> 14:06.323
If I recall,
you once slammed

14:06.367 --> 14:08.848
one of those doors in my face.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.198
I always hoped
for the opportunity to show you

14:11.241 --> 14:12.503
how nothing is off-limits

14:12.547 --> 14:13.896
to the Agency.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.203
CIA has been aware
we were on this case?

14:16.246 --> 14:19.032
Are you personally?

14:19.075 --> 14:20.685
[chuckles]

14:20.729 --> 14:21.817
Of course we know.

14:21.861 --> 14:24.298
We maintain a pipeline
of information

14:24.341 --> 14:26.300
within all our sister agencies.

14:26.343 --> 14:27.692
You referring
to Ray Cruz?

14:27.736 --> 14:29.520
Great. Another name.

14:29.564 --> 14:32.001
The CIA agent who's
been dating Ziva.

14:32.045 --> 14:33.437
Is he your pipeline?

14:33.481 --> 14:34.612
The Port-to-Port
Killer,

14:34.656 --> 14:37.224
as you've dubbed him,
has a name--

14:37.267 --> 14:40.314
Lieutenant Jonas Cobb.

14:40.357 --> 14:42.272
Navy.

14:42.316 --> 14:43.839
He was.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.581
How do you know that?

14:46.624 --> 14:48.583
I'll gladly answer all
your questions, Gibbs,

14:48.626 --> 14:50.324
if you'd answer
one of mine.

14:50.367 --> 14:53.588
How come Director Vance
has the new girl

14:53.631 --> 14:56.025
leading the charge,
instead of you?

14:57.679 --> 14:59.942
Case originated
in her jurisdiction.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.075
I'm well acquainted
with Cobb's origins,

15:02.118 --> 15:04.381
but since he
entered your purview--

15:04.425 --> 15:06.906
well, I'm surprised is all.

15:06.949 --> 15:10.126
Special Agent Barrett's
a qualified agent.

15:10.170 --> 15:11.954
Hmm.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.478
As far as I know,
seems her primary qualification

15:14.522 --> 15:16.480
is that she's not you.

15:16.524 --> 15:20.223
No history of questioning
her superiors.

15:20.267 --> 15:21.659
You ever read that file

15:21.703 --> 15:23.661
I gave you on Vance,
once upon a time?

15:23.705 --> 15:25.794
Just the tip
of the iceberg,

15:25.837 --> 15:27.448
you know?

15:27.491 --> 15:28.623
I am much more
interested

15:28.666 --> 15:30.451
in everything you have on Cobb.

15:30.494 --> 15:33.845
DiNozzo will drive you.Sure.

15:33.889 --> 15:36.761
What with your lack
of depth perception and all.

15:40.940 --> 15:43.464
That slippery weasel
is the reason you called?

15:52.299 --> 15:54.040
Hola,probie.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.345
¿Como está?

15:55.389 --> 15:58.218
Hey, Mike.

15:58.261 --> 16:00.568
How quickly can you get to DC?

16:00.611 --> 16:01.743
How fast you need me?

16:01.786 --> 16:03.875
[thunder crashing]

16:03.919 --> 16:07.357
GIBBS: Got something
I need you to bring.

16:08.924 --> 16:10.099
Gibbs, check it out.

16:10.143 --> 16:12.232
Someone caught Stark's murder
on their phone.

16:12.275 --> 16:13.842
His boss at
Norfolk received

16:13.885 --> 16:15.626
several e-mails from
an anonymous source.

16:15.670 --> 16:17.846
They're afraid to come forward.

16:19.239 --> 16:21.197
[toy cymbals crashing]

16:21.241 --> 16:22.764
[toy monkey chittering]

16:31.207 --> 16:33.035
Matches the profile.

16:33.079 --> 16:35.037
Hard confirmation
it's our guy.

16:35.081 --> 16:38.519
With a little Abby magic, we
might be able to pull a face.

16:38.562 --> 16:40.564
Well, it's early still,
but we also got these frames

16:40.608 --> 16:41.739
off of NCIS
security cameras.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.569
Same height and build.

16:47.354 --> 16:49.399
P2P killed Stark
to get inside the building.

16:49.443 --> 16:51.184
E.J.: We're going
to get his face,

16:51.227 --> 16:52.576
then his name, then him.

16:53.751 --> 16:55.231
That's good work.

16:57.886 --> 17:00.454
Director's tearing security
a new one.

17:00.497 --> 17:01.890
It's creepy.

17:01.933 --> 17:03.413
I mean, the guy was here.

17:03.457 --> 17:05.067
What was he doing?

17:08.418 --> 17:10.464
Where are my glasses?

17:10.507 --> 17:12.683
Studying.

17:12.727 --> 17:14.598
Studying us?

17:16.426 --> 17:18.820
Gotta know your enemy.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.911
Did you think about
keeping your mouth shut?

17:31.267 --> 17:33.487
Hey, Barrett.

17:33.530 --> 17:36.881
I have information
pertaining to your case.

17:42.452 --> 17:44.454
The CIA?

17:44.498 --> 17:47.588
Kort claims to be the man
who intervened in Hawaii.

17:47.631 --> 17:48.806
Well, I'm reluctant
to take anything

17:48.850 --> 17:50.504
Kort has to say
at face value.

17:50.547 --> 17:53.028
[chuckles]

17:53.072 --> 17:54.899
Would you care to share,
Agent Gibbs?

17:54.943 --> 17:57.641
Well, as far as confirmation,
his face has some value.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.817
It's no glass slipper.

17:59.861 --> 18:01.167
You proposing we stuff the eye

18:01.210 --> 18:02.733
back in the socket,
see if it fits?

18:02.777 --> 18:06.259
If you're looking
for volunteers.

18:06.302 --> 18:09.349
Agent Gibbs and I
have a bit of history

18:09.392 --> 18:11.002
with this particular operative.

18:11.046 --> 18:13.135
Oh. Then, that should
make it easier

18:13.179 --> 18:15.224
to initiate
some interagency cooperation.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.096
[Vance chuckles]

18:17.139 --> 18:19.794
Nothing's ever easy
with Trent Kort.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.187
[knock at door]

18:21.230 --> 18:23.102
Excuse me, sir.

18:23.145 --> 18:25.756
We've hit a bit of a snag.

18:25.800 --> 18:28.629
CIA says they won't release
what they've got on P2P.

18:28.672 --> 18:30.892
Uh, Jonas Cobb.

18:30.935 --> 18:33.808
They claim
it's classified.

18:42.077 --> 18:43.557
FRANKS:
I'm already on the plane.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.430
Didn't take too long to pack.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.998
Just checked the box
and my piece.

18:56.352 --> 19:00.443
Gonna run a razor
across that scraggly mug,

19:00.487 --> 19:03.533
or you just measuring
the weight of your conscience?

19:03.577 --> 19:05.318
[knocking on door]

19:07.407 --> 19:10.061
Well, ain't you
gonna let me in?

19:10.105 --> 19:12.890
[knocking harder]I said let me in, probie!

19:18.809 --> 19:20.550
Glad you could come, Mike.

19:20.594 --> 19:22.596
[Franks coughing]

19:22.639 --> 19:24.337
Me, too.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.122
[clears throat]
Offer me a drink.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.559
It's 6:00 in the morning.

19:29.603 --> 19:32.040
Float a Cheerio in it.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.607
I'm going to work.
You can come with me.

19:33.650 --> 19:35.826
All right.
A working vacation.

19:35.870 --> 19:38.220
But at least tell me
what brought all this on.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.091
You don't want to know.

19:40.135 --> 19:41.615
I wouldn't ask
if I didn't want to...

19:41.658 --> 19:42.877
I'll tell you later.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.357
I'm going to hold you
to that, you hear?

19:44.400 --> 19:46.402
I was going to leave you

19:46.446 --> 19:49.362
old Decker's insurance policy
when I go away.

19:52.278 --> 19:55.368
That box of goodies has kept me
in Vance's good standing

19:55.411 --> 19:56.804
for almost three years.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.197
I hope it does the same for you.

19:59.589 --> 20:00.634
I hope I don't need it.

20:17.520 --> 20:21.698
You already know
what comes next, Mike.

20:26.573 --> 20:28.836
Think it through again.

20:28.879 --> 20:31.708
That's why you're
staring at a body bag

20:31.752 --> 20:34.320
looking for answers.

20:34.363 --> 20:36.583
Think it through.

20:36.626 --> 20:38.976
Just how it happened.

20:44.199 --> 20:45.809
ABBY:
Mike!

20:45.853 --> 20:47.550
I didn't know you
were in town.

20:47.594 --> 20:49.248
Spur-of-the-moment thing.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.075
Had some frequent flier miles
set to expire.

20:51.119 --> 20:52.903
Yay.
What's all
the excitement?

20:52.947 --> 20:54.557
Um, Cade and I
isolated an image

20:54.601 --> 20:57.038
of this really big serial killer
that we've been calling P2P.

20:57.081 --> 20:59.867
We now know that his real name
is Lieutenant Jonas Cobb.

20:59.910 --> 21:02.217
He went UA last year.
We think he's using

21:02.261 --> 21:03.262
a bunch of different
identities

21:03.305 --> 21:04.524
because the CIA
is involved somehow,

21:04.567 --> 21:07.222
but the name Cobb isn't
getting us anywhere.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.180
He's the same guy
on the video that Levin got

21:09.224 --> 21:11.444
after Agent Stark was killed.
So these guys are going to go

21:11.487 --> 21:13.837
back out to the scene
and try to determine

21:13.881 --> 21:16.057
the angle of the video
and I.D. the source.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.928
Who the hell
are all these people?

21:17.972 --> 21:20.148
Oh. These are
the new guys.

21:20.191 --> 21:21.454
Gibbs didn't tell you?

21:23.064 --> 21:24.457
Man of few words.

21:24.500 --> 21:26.328
I've noticed.
McGee.

21:26.372 --> 21:28.112
I'm trying to back-trace
the e-mails

21:28.156 --> 21:29.853
Agent Stark's field office
received.

21:29.897 --> 21:31.725
So far, no luck.Hey. Mike.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.162
How are you,
Mr. Franks?

21:34.205 --> 21:35.772
Ooh.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.818
That's a little weird, huh?

21:37.861 --> 21:39.776
Nub kinda tickles
a bit, don't it?

21:39.820 --> 21:40.995
Just a little.

21:41.038 --> 21:42.953
TONY [quietly]:
Nasty.

21:42.997 --> 21:45.782
Uh, boss, anonymous tipster's
gone to a lot of trouble

21:45.826 --> 21:47.567
to remain anonymous.

21:47.610 --> 21:49.786
Only detail she's let
slip is she's a woman.And she claims

21:49.830 --> 21:51.962
she knows the man caught on
video and can help us find him.

21:52.006 --> 21:53.616
TONY: If we can get her
to come out of hiding.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.183
She probably thinks the killer's

21:55.226 --> 21:56.706
gonna turn on her,
just like...

21:56.750 --> 21:58.534
Jimmy Stewart,
in Rear Window.

21:58.578 --> 22:02.451
That's a sort of obvious and
rudimentary film reference.

22:02.495 --> 22:03.365
Yet accurate.

22:03.409 --> 22:05.498
Well...

22:05.541 --> 22:06.803
Accurate. Maybe.

22:06.847 --> 22:08.370
But lacking precision.

22:08.414 --> 22:10.372
Although that close-up of
Grace Kelly, you know...

22:10.416 --> 22:11.852
GIBBS:
Hey, speaking of blonde girls.

22:11.895 --> 22:14.376
Agent Barrett? She's in MTAC
with Kort and Vance.

22:14.420 --> 22:17.379
TONY:
Vance cut through
the CIA red tape.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.990
Can I borrow him, Abbs?
No.

22:20.034 --> 22:22.558
What do you want me for, probie?
I'm not involved in this mess.

22:22.602 --> 22:24.168
That's not what I
need you for, Mike.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.606
Oh, you're betting Vance
won't give me a hug,

22:26.649 --> 22:28.085
a handshake, or a wave.

22:28.129 --> 22:30.218
Well, let's just see
how he reacts.
Okay.

22:33.569 --> 22:35.876
Barrett. Kort.

22:35.919 --> 22:38.400
Meet NCIS legend
Mike Franks.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.576
Director.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.839
All right if I
stay for this

22:42.883 --> 22:44.754
educational briefing?

22:44.798 --> 22:47.844
This is, uh, sensitive
agency information.

22:47.888 --> 22:50.673
And this is my agency.

22:50.717 --> 22:52.893
I can't think of a better
reason for him to stay,

22:52.936 --> 22:55.330
other than that it makes
you so uncomfortable.

22:56.984 --> 22:59.508
I'll take this to my grave.

23:08.822 --> 23:12.434
Operation Frankenstein began

23:12.478 --> 23:14.218
with dozens of
potential candidates.

23:14.262 --> 23:17.874
Their numbers were whittled down
through a series of tests--

23:17.918 --> 23:21.138
written examinations,

23:21.182 --> 23:24.098
followed by
psychological evaluations,

23:24.141 --> 23:26.143
and of course, a physical.

23:26.187 --> 23:29.973
The qualifications
were intense.

23:30.017 --> 23:33.150
Each candidate was pushed
to the point of exhaustion

23:33.194 --> 23:36.458
under extreme circumstances--

23:36.502 --> 23:39.418
heat, cold--

23:39.461 --> 23:43.117
the point was to gauge
their emotional parameters,

23:43.160 --> 23:46.425
their ability to maintain
composure under the most

23:46.468 --> 23:48.122
arduous situations.

23:53.780 --> 23:57.261
Borders on the inhumane.

23:57.305 --> 24:00.482
KORT:
Frankenstein is an updated

24:00.526 --> 24:03.093
version of
a Cold War memorandum,

24:03.137 --> 24:06.619
suggesting the potential
of intersecting

24:06.662 --> 24:10.231
intelligence missions with
U.S. military serving abroad.

24:10.274 --> 24:12.102
FRANKS: Sounds like
a lot of mumbo jumbo

24:12.146 --> 24:15.497
from military men
doubling as spies.

24:15.541 --> 24:18.108
Not exactly spies.

24:18.152 --> 24:20.328
Assassins.

24:20.371 --> 24:22.199
You were training
U.S. servicemen

24:22.243 --> 24:24.463
to carry out
CIA wet work?

24:29.163 --> 24:33.036
Lieutenant Jonas Cobb
was the prototype.

24:33.080 --> 24:36.039
A fair to average
service record.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.346
He was anxious for advancement
that rarely came.

24:38.389 --> 24:42.306
Physically, emotionally,
he met all the parameters.

24:42.350 --> 24:43.873
The only question was...

24:43.917 --> 24:46.354
Could he kill?

24:46.397 --> 24:50.358
This footage is of
Cobb's first assignment:

24:50.401 --> 24:54.318
the execution of an al-Qaeda
operative working in...

24:54.362 --> 24:56.973
Well, that's still classified.

24:57.017 --> 24:59.149
It's cut together
with lipstick cameras

24:59.193 --> 25:01.848
placed in the designated
kill zone.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.116
The mission
was deemed a success.

25:09.159 --> 25:12.075
Unfortunately,

25:12.119 --> 25:14.817
when Cobb returned
to the program,

25:14.861 --> 25:17.864
he was far less responsive
to training and handling.

25:17.907 --> 25:19.953
Thing like that changes a man.

25:19.996 --> 25:21.650
Yeah.

25:21.694 --> 25:25.088
He failed to rejoin his unit
and his cover as a sailor.

25:25.132 --> 25:28.439
Equipped with a dozen CIA-made
passports and identities,

25:28.483 --> 25:30.137
Cobb went off the radar.

25:30.180 --> 25:31.399
And then...

25:31.442 --> 25:32.922
And then bodies
started popping up

25:32.966 --> 25:34.707
all over the globe.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.884
And you didn't think to say
anything to us until now.

25:37.927 --> 25:40.669
It's our mess.

25:40.713 --> 25:42.671
We've been trying
to clean it up.

25:42.715 --> 25:44.238
Surely, you can respect that.

25:50.157 --> 25:52.551
Got it!

25:52.594 --> 25:54.596
Traced the e-mails?

25:54.640 --> 25:57.164
Yep. Traced to a commercial
high-rise property.

25:57.207 --> 25:58.818
Must be the witness's
work address.

25:58.861 --> 25:59.993
Did I hear you say you got it?

26:02.169 --> 26:03.605
I'm gonna pick
up my team,

26:03.649 --> 26:05.259
then I'm gonna
pick up this witness.

26:05.302 --> 26:06.652
She's our best shot
at finding Cobb.

26:06.695 --> 26:08.262
Bring an umbrella;
it's gonna rain.

26:08.305 --> 26:10.351
You said that
yesterday.

26:12.745 --> 26:13.659
Did Kort spill?

26:13.702 --> 26:14.747
Yeah.

26:14.790 --> 26:16.052
Study this.

26:16.096 --> 26:18.620
Get Ducky to build
a new psych profile.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.796
Still don't know
why the M.O. changed on Stark.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.102
Where will you be?

26:22.145 --> 26:23.582
Research.

26:30.110 --> 26:32.895
KORT:
Frankenstein is
an updated version

26:32.939 --> 26:35.594
of a Cold War memorandum.

26:35.637 --> 26:39.859
Probably not a good idea
to light up down here, huh?

26:39.902 --> 26:43.384
Nothing but sawdust
and bourbon.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.868
Truth to tell...

26:54.569 --> 26:57.311
...I got sick of reading

26:57.354 --> 26:59.269
all this crap
about two folders in.

26:59.313 --> 27:02.272
Never really pegged you

27:02.316 --> 27:05.667
for the kind to dredge through
the covert operations history

27:05.711 --> 27:07.582
of NCIS.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.497
No, I'm not.

27:15.242 --> 27:16.939
You trusted Vance.

27:19.550 --> 27:21.335
I still do.

27:21.378 --> 27:24.294
But it hasn't been right
between you.

27:24.338 --> 27:27.776
Well, not lately.

27:27.820 --> 27:30.431
Can't just be something you did.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.607
Pushing you away,

27:32.651 --> 27:36.698
pulling this Barrett close.

27:36.742 --> 27:39.875
Even him and Kort seem to have
something cooking.

27:42.312 --> 27:43.444
It's tough to miss.

27:46.534 --> 27:49.363
Well, I hope these old ghosts
will tell you

27:49.406 --> 27:50.973
what you need to hear.

27:53.759 --> 27:56.675
You do hear ghosts, probie?

27:56.718 --> 27:58.589
[sighs]:
Yeah.

28:02.376 --> 28:04.987
Yeah, I see them, too.

28:06.772 --> 28:08.687
I believe we make them.

28:10.689 --> 28:12.560
We've made our share.

28:12.603 --> 28:15.128
Not just with this.

28:15.171 --> 28:17.957
With the memories we make.

28:20.089 --> 28:25.268
We fill the spaces
we live in with them.

28:25.312 --> 28:29.185
That's why I've always tried

28:29.229 --> 28:31.666
to make sure
that wherever I live,

28:31.710 --> 28:35.888
the longer I live there,

28:35.931 --> 28:39.979
the spaces become filled
with memories

28:40.022 --> 28:41.371
of naked women.

28:41.415 --> 28:43.286
[both laugh]

28:47.638 --> 28:50.032
To more good memories.

28:50.076 --> 28:51.947
Yeah.

28:51.991 --> 28:53.383
Fewer bad ones.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.908
[coughing]

28:58.737 --> 29:01.043
How about fewer altogether?

29:19.845 --> 29:22.021
FRANKS:
Is that all we talked about?

29:22.064 --> 29:24.980
You didn't say,
"Have a nice walk"?

29:25.024 --> 29:26.895
"Bye" or something?

29:35.077 --> 29:36.949
[thunder crashes, rumbles]

30:35.355 --> 30:38.575
Ain't you smart enough
to get out of the rain?

31:03.774 --> 31:06.038
Me neither... Jonas.

31:09.215 --> 31:12.827
My name is Mike Franks.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.874
I figure I got
one more fight left in me.

31:18.006 --> 31:19.225
You want it?

31:39.506 --> 31:40.899
[grunts]

31:49.559 --> 31:51.822
[grunting]

32:18.545 --> 32:20.416
Oh, Mike.

32:52.579 --> 32:54.189
Bye, Mike.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.768
Um, we-we can call you

33:07.811 --> 33:10.162
when we're finished
with the autopsy, if you...

33:10.205 --> 33:10.989
Leave him be, Mr. Palmer.

33:20.781 --> 33:22.130
Prints on the murder weapon?

33:22.174 --> 33:25.003
Yeah. Abby matched them
to Jonas Cobb.

33:25.046 --> 33:27.657
We canvassed a
20-block radius

33:27.701 --> 33:29.703
around the crime scene;
no trace of him.

33:29.746 --> 33:31.835
Or Mike's firearm.

33:31.879 --> 33:33.402
How many shots did you hear?

33:33.446 --> 33:34.838
Five.

33:34.882 --> 33:37.928
We recovered
five shell casings.

33:37.972 --> 33:41.062
McGee's dropping a net
on the city.

33:41.106 --> 33:45.893
Red-flagged every one of
Cobb's possible identities.

33:45.936 --> 33:50.071
Mike kept eight in the
mag, one in the chamber.

33:50.115 --> 33:51.899
Assume Cobb's armed.

33:51.942 --> 33:55.729
We did pull a slug
embedded in a parked car.

33:55.772 --> 33:58.079
Traces of blood on it;
through and through.

33:58.123 --> 34:00.777
We can assume Cobb
got hit at least once.

34:06.783 --> 34:08.959
Mike's swan song.

34:12.093 --> 34:13.312
Excuse me.

34:22.582 --> 34:25.237
Hey, Duck...

34:25.280 --> 34:27.804
it's a myth, isn't it?

34:27.848 --> 34:30.329
About the mute swan?

34:30.372 --> 34:32.983
Yes. They do
make a sound.

34:33.027 --> 34:34.681
They hiss, don't they?

34:34.724 --> 34:37.118
Yes.

34:37.162 --> 34:41.035
And they do not sing
before they die.

34:43.385 --> 34:44.647
Perfect.

34:48.782 --> 34:51.089
[sighs]

34:51.132 --> 34:55.093
There is always
another monster.

34:55.136 --> 34:56.833
Yep.

34:56.877 --> 34:58.531
I mean, we
pursue them,

34:58.574 --> 35:01.621
but we just keep making
targets of ourselves.

35:04.058 --> 35:06.278
Better us than someone
who didn't sign up for it.

35:10.108 --> 35:11.718
I don't think I
can take anymore.

35:15.461 --> 35:17.332
Hey.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.250
We're gonna get him.

35:22.294 --> 35:24.165
Okay?

35:34.175 --> 35:36.046
Bring it in.

35:48.798 --> 35:50.148
Did you update
your psych profile?

35:50.191 --> 35:52.846
Well, Cobb spent years within

35:52.889 --> 35:54.543
the rigid structure
of the military.

35:54.587 --> 35:58.504
These kills make a mockery
of rank and promotion.

35:58.547 --> 36:02.247
Changing uniforms after
cleansing the bodies.

36:02.290 --> 36:04.466
As if they
were reborn.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.468
His frequent use of ice

36:06.512 --> 36:10.124
might express how
he himself felt frozen.

36:10.168 --> 36:11.647
And bound.

36:11.691 --> 36:13.475
Constricting ropes.

36:13.519 --> 36:15.085
Tightly-wrapped
in plastic.

36:15.129 --> 36:17.784
Yes. Well, I'm sure
that his first kill,

36:17.827 --> 36:21.875
as an operative of the CIA,
liberated him from those rules--

36:21.918 --> 36:24.834
freedom from right and wrong.

36:24.878 --> 36:27.446
He became a beast, an animal.

36:27.489 --> 36:30.100
Yeah. I saw that in
his eyes on the video.

36:30.144 --> 36:32.712
In a moment, name, rank,
title meant nothing.

36:32.755 --> 36:34.453
It's primal.

36:34.496 --> 36:38.674
What dominates is instinct
and the will to survive.

36:38.718 --> 36:43.244
But I also believe that in
a face-to-face confrontation,

36:43.288 --> 36:45.464
Cobb feels insecure.

36:45.507 --> 36:48.293
He doesn't know if he can win.

36:48.336 --> 36:50.164
So he becomes a hunter.

36:50.208 --> 36:54.908
He picks his targets,
lays traps, dresses his kill.

36:54.951 --> 36:57.127
But why the change
in his M.O. now?

36:57.171 --> 36:59.217
His focus changed.

36:59.260 --> 37:02.045
He drew the attention
of predators

37:02.089 --> 37:05.875
further up the food chain in the
form of Kort and NCIS agents--

37:05.919 --> 37:08.661
predators he had to study.

37:08.704 --> 37:10.706
Duck, he was at my house.

37:10.750 --> 37:12.142
How does that fit in?

37:12.186 --> 37:15.276
I was deliberately
not chasing him.

37:15.320 --> 37:19.062
There's nothing to suggest that
he was there to commit violence.

37:19.106 --> 37:20.673
Mike Franks would
disagree with that.

37:20.716 --> 37:22.675
Mike Franks might have
picked the fight.

37:22.718 --> 37:24.503
You and I both know that.

37:24.546 --> 37:28.420
Each time Cobb has killed,
he baited the trap.

37:28.463 --> 37:30.552
That's never changed...

37:30.596 --> 37:32.554
prior to tonight.

37:32.598 --> 37:35.731
So he wasn't in your
neighborhood hunting; he was...

37:35.775 --> 37:37.124
He was doing research.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.386
Yeah.

37:41.781 --> 37:43.391
[door opens]

37:53.271 --> 37:55.490
I study you, Leon.

37:57.449 --> 37:59.059
I know you do.

37:59.102 --> 38:01.801
I study you back, Gibbs.

38:01.844 --> 38:03.759
It feels wrong...

38:03.803 --> 38:06.849
dig into your
life like that.

38:10.723 --> 38:12.986
But I do it.

38:13.029 --> 38:15.554
Because sometimes I
can't understand why

38:15.597 --> 38:18.383
you make the god-awful
decisions that you do.

38:21.386 --> 38:24.345
I feel the same way.

38:24.389 --> 38:27.174
The only difference is,

38:27.217 --> 38:29.045
you're not responsible
for my actions, Gibbs.

38:29.089 --> 38:30.525
But I am for yours.

38:30.569 --> 38:33.354
I should've been on this
case from the beginning.

38:33.398 --> 38:35.269
I'm sorry about
Mike Franks.

38:38.098 --> 38:41.362
Thank you.

38:41.406 --> 38:43.146
But you called him in.

38:43.190 --> 38:44.713
Figured I'd see him
and I'd bend.

38:44.757 --> 38:45.932
You always do.

38:45.975 --> 38:46.933
Whatever he's
got on you...

38:46.976 --> 38:49.457
There's nothing on me!

38:49.501 --> 38:51.372
I'm your boss, Gibbs.

38:51.416 --> 38:53.113
And we've been tight.

38:53.156 --> 38:56.377
Sometimes tight
like a damn noose.

38:56.421 --> 38:59.902
So if I backed off
on our friendship,

38:59.946 --> 39:02.470
maybe I had to step back,
take a deep breath

39:02.514 --> 39:04.385
and do my job.

39:04.429 --> 39:06.735
I have other people
I have to answer to.

39:06.779 --> 39:10.391
Maybe, maybe when bodies
were showing up in Europe.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.959
But when it's in
my own backyard,

39:13.002 --> 39:15.875
and you promote that...

39:15.918 --> 39:18.051
rookie over me?

39:18.094 --> 39:20.532
That wasn't my decision.

39:26.320 --> 39:27.539
Promotions.

39:30.629 --> 39:32.021
He hates them.

39:32.065 --> 39:35.242
Who? Cobb or you?

39:35.285 --> 39:37.418
He thinks we have
that in common.

39:37.462 --> 39:41.422
He-He stole a souvenir
from my desk.

39:41.466 --> 39:44.207
He was at my house.

39:44.251 --> 39:46.471
But he uses bait
to attract his targets.

39:46.514 --> 39:47.776
He's never baited you.

39:47.820 --> 39:50.300
No, not me.

39:50.344 --> 39:52.433
He feels a
kinship with me,

39:52.477 --> 39:54.000
because I got
skipped over.

39:54.043 --> 39:55.044
In favor of Barrett.

39:55.088 --> 39:56.959
There is no witness.

39:57.003 --> 40:00.833
He videoed himself.

40:00.876 --> 40:01.834
He's using it.

40:01.877 --> 40:02.791
Yeah, to bait the trap.

40:04.489 --> 40:05.751
Barrett.

40:05.794 --> 40:07.317
VANCE:
E.J., where are you?

40:07.361 --> 40:10.451
We've been scouring the building
the e-mails originated from,

40:10.495 --> 40:12.758
floor by floor, Director.

40:12.801 --> 40:14.194
Still haven't found anything.

40:14.237 --> 40:17.284
VANCE:
Be on high alert.

40:17.327 --> 40:19.895
Cobb is armed and likely
anticipates your arrival.

40:35.824 --> 40:37.478
You go high.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.437
Really?

40:50.317 --> 40:51.492
LEVIN:
Oh, my God...

41:10.598 --> 41:12.687
That is disturbing.

41:12.731 --> 41:13.601
[gunshot][groans]

41:14.559 --> 41:15.603
Gibbs.

41:19.433 --> 41:21.522
[gunfire]

41:21.566 --> 41:22.871
VANCE: Agent Barrett,
what's your status?

41:24.569 --> 41:26.745
[gunfire]

41:28.268 --> 41:29.399
Cade and Levin
are down.

41:29.443 --> 41:30.488
[grunting]

41:30.531 --> 41:31.880
I'm going after Cobb.

41:31.924 --> 41:34.492
