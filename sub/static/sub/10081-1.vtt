(laughing)

I did so.

Huh? Were they, Mama?
Stop it!

Tell me.
Quit, Patsy.

05:58.367 --> 06:00.266
(laughing)

06:00.266 --> 06:03.567
Back when I was in high school
and had a better shape,

06:03.567 --> 06:06.900
there was this boy
named Teddy Welloff.

06:06.900 --> 06:10.633
Had gray eyes, he did,
with coal black eyelashes.

06:10.633 --> 06:13.300
This is way before
I met your daddy.

06:13.300 --> 06:15.133
May he rot in hell.

06:15.133 --> 06:16.834
Don't speak like
that about your daddy.

06:16.834 --> 06:19.467
Anyway, at lunch we'd all
go into the cloakroom

06:19.467 --> 06:20.934
to get our dinner buckets.

06:20.934 --> 06:23.000
And every day
this Teddy Welloff

06:23.000 --> 06:25.133
used to brush his
front up against me

06:25.133 --> 06:27.300
when I was bent over
getting my...
Ooh, Mama! Mama!

06:27.300 --> 06:29.033
Now, that's the truth.

06:29.033 --> 06:30.166
Now, wait a minute,
there's more.

06:32.734 --> 06:36.333
One day, I took my
ink pen with me.

06:36.333 --> 06:39.633
And that thing had a real
sharp point on it.

06:39.633 --> 06:41.834
(Patsy laughing)

06:41.834 --> 06:45.367
Well, I never even looked
at him the rest of the day.

06:45.367 --> 06:48.633
But my hand to God,
there was egg salad sandwich

06:48.633 --> 06:50.900
all over that cloakroom.

06:50.900 --> 06:54.266
And that boy walked
funny for a week.

06:54.266 --> 06:57.533
(laughing)
Stop! I'm gonna pee my pants!

06:57.533 --> 07:01.133
(laughing)

07:02.266 --> 07:04.500
You gonna come on
in for a while?

07:04.500 --> 07:06.900
Well, is Gerald still up?

07:06.900 --> 07:08.567
It looks like it.

07:08.567 --> 07:10.834
No, honey,
I better go on home.

07:10.834 --> 07:12.200
You chicken!

07:12.200 --> 07:14.200
I'll be over
for Sunday dinner.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.133
Bye.
Bye-bye.

07:16.133 --> 07:17.567

Good night.

07:17.567 --> 07:19.500
Good night, baby.

07:22.033 --> 07:23.967
(audio from TV plays)

07:23.967 --> 07:26.133
I'm home.

07:26.133 --> 07:27.967
Gerald:
How'd it go?

07:27.967 --> 07:31.433
Well, I only made $25.

07:31.433 --> 07:33.900
I did real good,
I think.

07:33.900 --> 07:35.133
That's nice.

07:35.133 --> 07:37.066
I sang "San Antonio Rose."

07:37.066 --> 07:38.033
Oh.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.567
I've been gone
all evening, Gerald.

07:43.567 --> 07:45.200
Don't you want to talk to me?

07:45.200 --> 07:50.066
And say "Kiss my ass"
or something?

07:50.066 --> 07:52.667
Sorry, honey.

07:52.667 --> 07:54.166
How'd it go tonight?

07:54.166 --> 07:57.133
You already asked me that.

07:57.133 --> 07:59.967
Ask me something else?

07:59.967 --> 08:03.734
Come on, let's have
a conversation.

08:03.734 --> 08:07.233
Notice anything different?

08:07.233 --> 08:10.400
I finished the riggin'.

08:13.333 --> 08:17.133
Patsy, why are you always
pushing at me so hard?

08:17.133 --> 08:18.967
I don't know.

08:18.967 --> 08:23.033
Just hoping for a fight,
or a laugh or something.

08:23.033 --> 08:25.367
I don't want
to fight with you.

08:25.367 --> 08:27.467
I'm not mad.

08:30.834 --> 08:33.433
Ugh! I can't stand it.

08:33.433 --> 08:36.400
Makes me want to scream
and claw my face!

08:36.400 --> 08:37.700
What am I gonna do?

08:37.700 --> 08:40.033
You didn't ask me how to
get into this marriage.

08:40.033 --> 08:42.967
I don't think you ought to
ask me how to get out of it.

08:42.967 --> 08:45.333
Is he mean to you?
No.

08:45.333 --> 08:47.700
Does he drink? Gamble?

08:47.700 --> 08:49.934
Does he chase the women?

08:49.934 --> 08:52.066
Well, then what?

08:52.066 --> 08:53.300
Come on, girl.

08:53.300 --> 08:55.333
Speak the truth
and shame the devil.

08:55.333 --> 08:58.100
God as my witness,
Mama, I don't know!

08:58.100 --> 09:00.066
I laid in bed last night
and I thought,

09:00.066 --> 09:01.700
"Shit, what if I was blind

09:01.700 --> 09:03.333
or didn't have
my legs or something?"

09:03.333 --> 09:05.567
You watch that mouth.

09:05.567 --> 09:06.700
Ugh!

09:06.700 --> 09:10.000
Mom, I'm home!
I'm starvin'.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.500
Well, there's lunch
meat in there

09:11.500 --> 09:13.066
but don't spoil your dinner.

09:13.066 --> 09:14.600
And say hello to your sister

09:14.600 --> 09:16.233
before you worry
about your belly.

09:16.233 --> 09:17.400
Hi, Patsy.

09:17.400 --> 09:18.834
Oh, I don't know
Mama, I mean, uh...

09:18.834 --> 09:20.667
My life ain't so bad.

09:20.667 --> 09:23.033
I got a decent house,
a man who loves me.

09:23.033 --> 09:25.934
Hell, I've even sung on
television four times.

09:25.934 --> 09:28.367
So tell me, why do
I have to force myself

09:28.367 --> 09:30.734
to get out of bed
every morning of my life?

09:30.734 --> 09:33.400
Well, you always was
hard to keep satisfied,

09:33.400 --> 09:34.500
even when you was little.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.266
Well, I'm not talking
about when I was three.

09:37.266 --> 09:40.600
I'm asking you what
I should do now.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.667
Oh, maybe you should
scream and claw your face.

09:43.667 --> 09:44.834
See if that'll help.

49:27.233 --> 49:29.400
Hi, darlin'.

49:31.000 --> 49:33.133
What are you doin'?

49:33.133 --> 49:36.200
Havin' a glass of champagne
with Kirk Douglas.

49:36.200 --> 49:38.266
What's it look
like I'm doin'?

49:38.266 --> 49:40.767
You don't have to iron
me a shirt every day, you know.

49:40.767 --> 49:43.500
I thought you told me Sergeant
Wilson wanted you lookin' sharp.

49:43.500 --> 49:45.533
Hey, I'll tell you a secret.

49:45.533 --> 49:48.000
I don't give a good goddamn
what Sergeant Wilson says.

49:48.000 --> 49:49.767
That tight-assed bastard's
been on my back

49:49.767 --> 49:52.000
ever since I got here.

49:54.667 --> 49:57.200
God, I hate this army.

49:57.200 --> 49:58.633
I hate this state.

49:58.633 --> 50:00.734
And I hate this stinking
little miserable apartment.

50:00.734 --> 50:03.700
Well, I've been places
I like better, too.

50:03.700 --> 50:06.433
I could still be making
records if I'd stayed home.

50:06.433 --> 50:08.633
Nobody asked you
to come here!

50:08.633 --> 50:10.400
(chuckling)
The hell you didn't!

50:10.400 --> 50:11.734
You begged me!

50:11.734 --> 50:12.767
Yeah, well, I didn't mean it.

50:12.767 --> 50:16.166
Oh, come on, Charlie,
don't fuss now.

50:16.166 --> 50:18.533
I'm makin' chili for dinner,
you like that.

50:18.533 --> 50:20.400
Let's just be nice!

50:20.400 --> 50:21.934
(mocking)
Oh, my...

50:21.934 --> 50:24.800
"I'm makin' chili,
and I try to be nice,

50:24.800 --> 50:27.033
but my husband's just
so rude and nasty."

50:27.033 --> 50:28.033
Oh, shut up.

50:28.033 --> 50:29.667
Oh, poor Patsy!

50:29.667 --> 50:31.133
Why don't you just
shut your mouth?

50:31.133 --> 50:32.533
Why don't you just
try and make me?

50:32.533 --> 50:34.033
Don't push me, Charlie.

50:34.033 --> 50:35.567
I dare you.

50:39.900 --> 50:42.900
Uhh!

50:42.900 --> 50:43.900
Patsy...

50:43.900 --> 50:45.133
Patsy!

50:45.133 --> 50:46.700
Leave me alone!

50:48.600 --> 50:51.600
You know the part I remember?

50:51.600 --> 50:54.266
I remember the part when
you told me over and over

50:54.266 --> 50:56.233
how you're gonna protect me.

50:56.233 --> 50:59.233
Keep anybody from hurtin' me!

50:59.233 --> 51:01.500
You remember all those
times you told me that?!

51:01.500 --> 51:02.734
Patsy, wait!

51:02.734 --> 51:03.867
(Patsy screams,
slams door)

51:03.867 --> 51:06.367
(lock clicks)
Patsy, I'm sorry.

51:06.367 --> 51:09.233
(rattles doorknob)
Come on, open the door up.

51:15.467 --> 51:18.467
I'll bring the rest.

51:18.467 --> 51:20.667
(Patsy)
Will you get the
baby things, John?

51:20.667 --> 51:22.734
Okay, sis.

51:32.633 --> 51:34.400
("Walkin' After Midnight"
playing on record player)

51:34.400 --> 51:36.934
I'm gonna start singin' again
right after the baby's born.

51:36.934 --> 51:39.767
Hilda:
Oh, I was hopin' you'd
stay home for a while.

51:39.767 --> 51:44.266
I'm gonna start singin' the
same week the baby's born.

51:44.266 --> 51:46.934
I can make it, Mama,
damn it, I know I can.

51:46.934 --> 51:48.734
All I need is just
one good song,

51:48.734 --> 51:51.333
one good song to put me
over the top.

51:51.333 --> 51:55.266
Then when I've made enough,
I can retire, raise the baby.

51:55.266 --> 51:57.300
♪ I walk for miles... ♪

51:57.300 --> 51:59.767
I just wanna
make it right.

51:59.767 --> 52:02.500
You forgot the part
about the yellow roses.

52:08.367 --> 52:10.734
(distant train whistle)

52:18.333 --> 52:19.600
Hmm...

52:23.333 --> 52:24.934
Ahh...

52:35.867 --> 52:38.166
(horn honking)

52:49.700 --> 52:52.100
(music playing)

52:55.500 --> 52:57.133
What the livin' hell?
They told me you were--

52:57.133 --> 52:59.066
It's a false alarm.

53:01.867 --> 53:03.633
Hilda, why don't you
put a star in your crown,

53:03.633 --> 53:06.333
and go get old
Charlie a beer?

53:06.333 --> 53:08.266
(music stops)

53:12.266 --> 53:13.433
Can I have a kiss?

53:18.667 --> 53:21.166
Can I have a decent kiss?

53:28.233 --> 53:30.633
Miss me?

53:30.633 --> 53:32.600
Nope.

53:37.500 --> 53:41.667
I didn't know it till
I saw you, but, yes, I did.

53:43.166 --> 53:44.767
Look at you.

53:46.033 --> 53:49.100
I got ten days' leave.

53:49.100 --> 53:52.166
I got two good-lookin'
women to spend it with...

53:52.166 --> 53:53.900
and a baby on the way!

53:53.900 --> 53:56.200
(laughing)

53:56.200 --> 53:58.333
Hog heaven!

54:02.166 --> 54:04.166
Mmm...

54:05.767 --> 54:09.166
(Patsy)
Mama, look at these sweet little
things Betty just gave me.

54:09.166 --> 54:10.533
Oh, they...
Aren't they darlin'?

54:10.533 --> 54:11.867
Look at that one.

54:11.867 --> 54:13.867
It's got a little
bit of embroidery.

54:13.867 --> 54:15.667
(football game plays)

54:17.633 --> 54:20.000
Damn it! Get your feet
off the baby's clothes.

54:20.000 --> 54:21.300
Aah!

54:21.300 --> 54:24.000
Charlie, for the love of God!

54:24.000 --> 54:26.400
Why don't you get out
from under our feet?

54:26.400 --> 54:29.800
Go buy yourself a beer
or something, Lord.

54:31.166 --> 54:33.100
All right, if that's what
you think I should do.

54:33.100 --> 54:35.200
Yeah.

54:35.200 --> 54:37.533
Dinner's at 6:00!
All right.

54:37.533 --> 54:39.400
Charlie here says
he loves the army.

54:39.400 --> 54:40.834
Oh, hell, yes.

54:40.834 --> 54:42.700
Says he's gonna re-enlist
when his time's up.

54:42.700 --> 54:44.000
(chuckling)

54:44.000 --> 54:45.200
You know, Woodhouse,

54:45.200 --> 54:47.200
I never saw so many
teeth in a horse's ass.

54:47.200 --> 54:48.500
(laughing)

54:48.500 --> 54:49.667
I gotta go.

54:49.667 --> 54:51.266
Oh, you butthole,
come on.

54:51.266 --> 54:53.000
I didn't know they made
apron strings this long.

54:53.000 --> 54:54.333
I gotta get home.

54:54.333 --> 54:56.000
Come on, let's stop
and have one.
I gotta get home.

54:56.000 --> 54:57.233
It's on the way,
just a quick one.

54:57.233 --> 54:59.467
(chatter and laughter)

55:00.667 --> 55:03.600
Hey, bartender, let us
have a shot for everybody.

55:03.600 --> 55:05.467
No, not for me.

55:05.467 --> 55:07.333
Nothing but the best for
Charlie.

55:07.333 --> 55:09.667
Woman:
Yes, one more, just
for you one now.

55:09.667 --> 55:11.333
One more.
Just one before you go.

55:11.333 --> 55:12.800
No, I gotta get goin'.

55:12.800 --> 55:14.400
You all... y'all
have a good night.

55:14.400 --> 55:16.400
It's been real nice.
I'll see you before I go.

55:16.400 --> 55:17.734
All right.
Hey, Charlie.

55:17.734 --> 55:19.000
What?

55:19.000 --> 55:20.533
Oh, nothin'.
What?

55:20.533 --> 55:23.266
(chuckling)
Well, your hair is all...

55:23.266 --> 55:25.633
You look so different
with short hair.

55:25.633 --> 55:26.767
So?

55:26.767 --> 55:29.667
So, I think
it's kind of cute.

55:29.667 --> 55:31.633
I like it.

55:32.800 --> 55:34.567
(chuckling)

55:34.567 --> 55:36.467
Remember? Hmm?

55:36.467 --> 55:39.333
All those good times we had.

55:39.333 --> 55:40.567
(laughing)

55:40.567 --> 55:42.233
Yeah, I remember.

55:42.233 --> 55:44.266
(sighs)
Of course, I remember.

55:44.266 --> 55:48.533
Well, why do you have
to go home so early, then?

55:50.867 --> 55:52.834
Talk to me, Charlie.

55:57.800 --> 56:00.367
You know I've always
liked you, Charlie.

56:03.066 --> 56:04.867
We're goin'
to Carol's house.

56:04.867 --> 56:06.700
Come on, Charlie.

56:10.066 --> 56:12.066
Let's get outta here.

56:14.633 --> 56:16.300
Is the father around
so I can get

56:16.300 --> 56:18.467
the rest of this
information from him?

56:18.467 --> 56:20.200
Well, what's his name?

56:20.200 --> 56:22.166
Charles Dick.

56:22.166 --> 56:23.900
Son of a bitch!

56:23.900 --> 56:25.767
Stop that
dirty talk now.

56:25.767 --> 56:27.967
He'll be here soon.

56:27.967 --> 56:30.734
The son of a bitch!

56:30.734 --> 56:33.000
(laughing)

56:33.000 --> 56:34.800
Oh, Mama...
(laughing)

56:42.400 --> 56:45.000
(phone ringing)

56:47.133 --> 56:48.967
(ringing)

56:50.867 --> 56:53.100
Somebody answer the phone!

56:55.266 --> 56:56.867
(ringing)

56:56.867 --> 56:58.633
Hello.

56:58.633 --> 57:00.033
Hilda: Charlie?

57:00.033 --> 57:01.033
Hilda, where are you?

57:01.033 --> 57:03.100
Charlie, we're
at the hospital.

57:03.100 --> 57:04.400
She's had her baby.

57:04.400 --> 57:05.433
I'll be right down.

57:05.433 --> 57:06.934
No, you won't be right down.

57:06.934 --> 57:09.200
You just keep
your miserable self away.

57:09.200 --> 57:11.667
She had a hard time
and she's finally asleep.

57:11.667 --> 57:15.934
She asked for you 14 times
tonight, and you weren't there.

57:15.934 --> 57:19.600
Damn your soul,
Charlie Dick, where were you?

57:49.900 --> 57:52.166
There's your dad.

57:55.467 --> 57:57.266
Hi, honey.

58:01.400 --> 58:03.266
She's beautiful.

58:06.333 --> 58:08.300
You want to hold her?

58:08.300 --> 58:10.300
Yeah....

58:10.300 --> 58:12.200
(baby coos)

58:12.200 --> 58:15.066
Come here,
you little thing.

58:15.066 --> 58:16.533
(chuckling)

58:16.533 --> 58:18.133
I got her.

58:18.133 --> 58:20.066
I got ya.

58:21.567 --> 58:24.700
Woman over PA:
Dr. Hollis, first floor
at 3:00, please.

58:24.700 --> 58:28.500
Dr. Hollis, please come
to first floor at 3:00.

58:28.500 --> 58:29.700
She's so pretty.

58:29.700 --> 58:30.967
Yeah.

58:30.967 --> 58:32.533
Look at her hair.
I know.

58:32.533 --> 58:34.767
It's curlin' already.

58:38.900 --> 58:41.867
You still think Julie's
a good name for her?

58:49.500 --> 58:51.700
I wish to God
I'd been with you.

58:51.700 --> 58:54.233
Yeah, where were you?

58:54.233 --> 58:57.967
I'd tell you a hundred
lies, but I ain't goin' to.

58:57.967 --> 58:59.600
Got drunk.

59:02.367 --> 59:05.500
(chuckling)

59:05.500 --> 59:08.567
That's whiskey
under the bridge.

59:38.867 --> 59:40.667
(coin clinks)

59:48.567 --> 59:50.300
(line ringing)

59:50.300 --> 59:51.667
Operator:
50 cents, please.

59:51.667 --> 59:53.100
Yes, ma'am.

59:55.066 --> 59:57.467
(line ringing)

59:57.467 --> 59:59.133
Patsy: Hello?
Hi, baby, it's me.

59:59.133 --> 01:00:00.266
Hi, Charlie.

01:00:00.266 --> 01:00:01.767
Guess what?
What?

01:00:01.767 --> 01:00:03.533
I found us a new apartment.

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:05.533
It's got room for the baby,
and it's still cheaper

01:00:05.533 --> 01:00:07.834
than that other one
we had down here.

01:00:07.834 --> 01:00:10.934
Got a big kitchen, too.

01:00:10.934 --> 01:00:13.567
So, what do you say?
Why don't you come on down?

01:00:13.567 --> 01:00:15.700
No, Charlie, I can't.

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:19.033
I want to start singin' again,
and Mama helps me with Julie.

01:00:19.033 --> 01:00:21.133
Come on, baby.

01:00:21.133 --> 01:00:23.433
I really miss ya.
I wanna see my kid.

01:00:23.433 --> 01:00:25.600
Well, don't you get another
leave in a couple of months?

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.300
You can certainly
see her then.

01:00:27.300 --> 01:00:29.600
Goddamn, why are you
so polite anymore?

01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:31.100
Can't you just talk normal?

01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.600
I feel like I'm talkin'
to Eleanor Roosevelt.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.166
I gotta go, Charlie,
the baby's cryin'.

01:00:36.166 --> 01:00:37.700
I'll talk to you, okay?

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.767
Yeah, okay,
if Julie's cryin'.

01:00:39.767 --> 01:00:41.667
(dial tone)

01:01:49.033 --> 01:01:51.233
Charlie:
Patsy.

01:01:51.233 --> 01:01:53.166
You awake?

01:01:53.166 --> 01:01:54.700
Come on, wake up, baby.

01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:56.133
Patsy?
(gasps)

01:01:56.133 --> 01:01:57.367
Shh.

01:01:57.367 --> 01:01:59.166
Put something on.
I wanna take you someplace.

01:01:59.166 --> 01:02:00.700
What's the matter?
What are you doing here?

01:02:00.700 --> 01:02:02.266
Come on,
come on, it's important.

01:02:02.266 --> 01:02:04.133
What are you crazy?
It's the middle of night!

01:02:04.133 --> 01:02:06.066
Come on, come on.
I can't leave the baby.

01:02:06.066 --> 01:02:07.533
We'll put her in
with Hilda, come on.

01:02:22.533 --> 01:02:25.200
Charlie, why won't you tell me
what this is all about?

01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.100
Just wait.

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:31.066
Well, at least tell me
where we're going.

01:02:31.066 --> 01:02:32.834
Shh...

01:02:42.834 --> 01:02:45.233
("Stranger on the Shore"
playing)

01:03:10.767 --> 01:03:12.934
I need something
from you.

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:16.867
I need you to look me
in the face and say,

01:03:16.867 --> 01:03:19.467
"You screw up a lot, but
I still love you, Charlie.

01:03:19.467 --> 01:03:21.734
And I always will."

01:03:21.734 --> 01:03:25.400
I told you before you left,
I'm not holding any grudges.

01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:30.100
I need something from you.

01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:32.400
I need you to look me
in the face and say,

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:33.700
"You screw up a lot,

01:03:33.700 --> 01:03:36.200
but I still love you,
Charlie, I always will."

01:03:46.467 --> 01:03:49.133
You screw up a lot, Charlie.

01:03:49.133 --> 01:03:51.633
But I still love
you and I always will.

01:03:51.633 --> 01:03:53.800
Say it again.

01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:56.266
You screw up a lot,

01:03:56.266 --> 01:04:00.333
but I still love you, Charlie,
I always will.

01:05:54.066 --> 01:05:55.600
Yeah?

01:05:55.600 --> 01:05:56.867
I'm Randy Hughes.

01:05:56.867 --> 01:05:58.834
Hey, I was just
coming to see you.

01:05:58.834 --> 01:06:00.333
Is that right?
Yeah.

01:06:00.333 --> 01:06:02.767
You know, you wrote me a letter
about a year ago or so, but...

01:06:02.767 --> 01:06:04.533
Mm-hmm.
I had a baby since then.

01:06:04.533 --> 01:06:06.633
I haven't been doin'
too much singing but I--

01:06:06.633 --> 01:06:08.333
You don't have to sell me.

01:06:08.333 --> 01:06:09.934
I happen to think
you're maybe

01:06:09.934 --> 01:06:11.767
the best country
singer in the world.

01:06:11.767 --> 01:06:14.166
(chuckling)
Come in here.

01:06:14.166 --> 01:06:15.333
Let's you and I talk.

01:06:15.333 --> 01:06:17.033
I always did like
a man who knew

01:06:17.033 --> 01:06:19.967
how to start off
a conversation good.

01:06:19.967 --> 01:06:23.767
I swear, I can make us
both a lot of money.

01:06:23.767 --> 01:06:26.133
You won't be sorry.
You know why not?

01:06:26.133 --> 01:06:27.400
Why?

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.433
Because when the song
is right and I feel it,

01:06:30.433 --> 01:06:32.700
I can tell from looking
at people's faces

01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:35.033
that I've reached right down
there inside them.

01:06:35.033 --> 01:06:37.500
You got any idea
what that feels like?

01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:39.500
You wanna be
Kitty Wells, right?

01:06:39.500 --> 01:06:42.333
Hell, no!
I wanna be Hank Williams!

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:43.867
All right.

01:06:43.867 --> 01:06:47.266
Sit down, listen to me.

01:06:47.266 --> 01:06:50.200
I got a story to tell you.

01:06:51.734 --> 01:06:55.066
I heard you sing one night
in a dump in Virginia.

01:06:55.066 --> 01:06:57.834
12 tables,
watered-down drinks.

01:06:57.834 --> 01:07:00.333
Dance floor the size
of that coffee table.

01:07:00.333 --> 01:07:02.567
And you were good.

01:07:02.567 --> 01:07:04.066
The crowd liked ya.

01:07:04.066 --> 01:07:07.100
Just ate up all that yodelin'
and growlin' stuff.

01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:12.533
And then you let go on
"Walkin' the Floor Over You."

01:07:12.533 --> 01:07:17.033
But you did it slow,
like a ballad.

01:07:17.033 --> 01:07:19.400
And I'm tellin' you,

01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:22.667
the hair on the back
of my neck stood up.

01:07:22.667 --> 01:07:26.900
I mean, there I was
in this dive in Virginia,

01:07:26.900 --> 01:07:30.600
and I was listening to
something real special.

01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.967
Yeah.

01:07:31.967 --> 01:07:33.600
You get my drift?

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:34.600
Nope.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:37.100
I'll make it simple.

01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:43.700
You got a voice that was
made to sing love songs.

01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:46.300
And if I work with you,

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.467
we take advantage
of that fact.

01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:52.633
Patsy:
I don't wanna talk
about it anymore.

01:07:52.633 --> 01:07:55.200
I got a couple starving kids
waiting for me in the car.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.100
Randy:
It's too late, Patsy,
it's all set up.

01:07:57.100 --> 01:07:58.734
I don't give a damn!

01:07:58.734 --> 01:08:01.900
I don't want four big male
singers drowning me out.

01:08:01.900 --> 01:08:03.100
Well, they've been booked

01:08:03.100 --> 01:08:04.400
and they're gonna
be there at 2:00.

01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.800
Yeah, well, if they're there,
I'm not showing up.

01:08:06.800 --> 01:08:08.200
Musicians are booked.

01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:09.567
Owen Bradley's
gonna be there.

01:08:09.567 --> 01:08:10.800
I'm gonna be there.

01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:12.200
You can show up or not.

01:08:12.200 --> 01:08:13.567
Just suit your damn self.

01:08:13.567 --> 01:08:14.700
I will.

01:08:14.700 --> 01:08:16.433
2:00.

01:08:16.433 --> 01:08:19.800
Grab hold of Randy, Madrine.

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:23.466
They got four singers
backing me up today, big ones.

01:08:23.466 --> 01:08:25.466
They're just gonna
drown me out.

01:08:25.466 --> 01:08:27.466
Hell's bells!

01:08:27.466 --> 01:08:30.100

have the next bit.

01:08:51.066 --> 01:08:52.600
Randy's tellin' me you've
been worryin' again.

01:08:55.233 --> 01:08:56.966
I know, but I wanted to talk to
you about something--

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.133
No, now listen to me.
Everything's all right.

01:08:58.133 --> 01:08:59.500

I like everything
you sing, I mean...

01:11:18.734 --> 01:11:21.800
You just open your
mouth and I fall down.

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:24.567

them slow ones...

01:11:24.567 --> 01:11:27.333

01:11:35.533 --> 01:11:38.900
I wanna buy Mama
a pure silk dress.

01:11:38.900 --> 01:11:43.567
Give Sylvia that graduation
party she never had.

01:11:43.567 --> 01:11:46.066
I want to spend
some of that money.

01:11:46.066 --> 01:11:47.533
Well, I'll tell you what.

01:11:47.533 --> 01:11:49.633

Ooh, that's pretty.

01:11:59.033 --> 01:12:01.266
Bake that all
by your lonesome?

01:12:01.266 --> 01:12:03.033
I sure did.

01:12:05.934 --> 01:12:09.467
How come you didn't bake
me a cake for my birthday?

01:12:09.467 --> 01:12:11.734
Goddamn it, Charlie,
that's not funny.

01:12:11.734 --> 01:12:14.533
Been working on that all day.

01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:18.333
Oh, look, didn't
this pie turn out nice?

01:12:18.333 --> 01:12:19.433
Mm-hmm.

01:12:19.433 --> 01:12:22.667
Thickened it with tapioca
just like Mama does.

01:12:22.667 --> 01:12:26.266
I can't wait to see her and
John and Sylvie tomorrow.

01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:29.100
Hey, Charlie...

01:12:31.233 --> 01:12:32.467
Hmm?

01:12:32.467 --> 01:12:33.967
Why don't you go
a little easy

01:12:33.967 --> 01:12:36.834
on that drinkin'
tomorrow at the party?

01:12:36.834 --> 01:12:39.500

kiss my furry butt?

Charlie...

01:12:50.133 --> 01:12:52.000
I'm cooking chicken,
come on.

01:12:53.133 --> 01:12:54.767
Cookin' chicken, Charlie.
Stop it now.

01:12:54.767 --> 01:12:56.567
Where the kids at?
Everything's gonna burn.

01:12:56.567 --> 01:12:58.000
Hm? Where the kids at?

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:59.767
They're upstairs
in their bedroom.

01:12:59.767 --> 01:13:00.900
Well, good.
Come on, Charlie...

01:13:00.900 --> 01:13:02.667
Oh, baby.
Oh, Lord!

01:13:02.667 --> 01:13:04.867
On the linoleum floor?

01:13:04.867 --> 01:13:07.467
With my dress
up around my ears?

01:13:07.467 --> 01:13:09.900
Oh, Charlie!

01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:13.100

whoa!

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:20.667
Come on, just like
New York City.

a high school graduate

01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.767
in our family
for the very first time!

01:13:35.767 --> 01:13:38.533
And Charlie and I finally
got enough money...

01:13:38.533 --> 01:13:40.667
Finally!

01:13:40.667 --> 01:13:42.500
To give her a party
and buy her a present.

01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.734
Here it is!
Happy graduation, Sylvie.

01:13:44.734 --> 01:13:46.734
It's a new toothbrush.

01:13:46.734 --> 01:13:48.166
Whoo!

01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:51.667
(chuckling)

01:13:51.667 --> 01:13:53.600
Don't Sylvia look
sweet today?

01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:54.600
(chuckling)

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.500
Patsy:
I just love her new hairdo.

01:13:56.500 --> 01:13:57.633
(baby crying)

01:13:57.633 --> 01:13:59.300
Mama, I'm gonna put him
down, he's so crabby.

01:13:59.300 --> 01:14:00.333
Oh, good night, honey.

01:14:00.333 --> 01:14:02.066
Give Grandma a kiss.
Nighty-night.

01:14:02.066 --> 01:14:03.867
(crying continues)

01:14:03.867 --> 01:14:05.400
Here, sweetheart.

01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:06.667
Put him down.

01:14:06.667 --> 01:14:08.533
Give Mama a kiss, okay.

01:14:08.533 --> 01:14:10.567
(crying)

01:14:10.567 --> 01:14:11.767
(sighs)

01:14:11.767 --> 01:14:14.533
It just kills me
I don't see him more.

01:14:14.533 --> 01:14:15.900
I know it.

01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:17.100
I wrote that book.

01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:22.033
How's things with
you and Charlie?

01:14:22.033 --> 01:14:24.967
Up and down?

01:14:24.967 --> 01:14:27.300
There's lots
of up and down.

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:29.734
Oh, Patsy! Ohh...

01:14:29.734 --> 01:14:31.066
Oh!

01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:32.834
(laughing)

01:14:32.834 --> 01:14:35.367
Geez, Mama.

01:14:35.367 --> 01:14:38.333
Well, you know Charlie,
I mean, he drinks a little.

01:14:38.333 --> 01:14:40.700
But hell, I knew that
when I married him.

01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:44.667
Other than that,
things are silky smooth.

01:14:44.667 --> 01:14:47.200
Course, when he drinks,
he's got a temper.

01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:48.734
Does he hit you?

01:14:48.734 --> 01:14:52.000
Just that one time.

01:14:54.433 --> 01:14:58.567
They say if a man hits you once,
there's always another time.

01:14:58.567 --> 01:15:02.533
Hey, sis, you have some money?
We want some more beer.

01:15:02.533 --> 01:15:04.166
Ooh, I wanna go with you.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:05.667
(chuckling)

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:07.800
See you in a minute, Mama.

01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:16.867
You don't mean to tell me you
don't remember Barbara Simmons?

01:15:16.867 --> 01:15:19.633
You had crush on her all
through the fifth grade.

01:15:19.633 --> 01:15:21.934
Patsy, you're nothin'
but a damn liar.

01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:24.834
I don't know why, though,
with that frizzy brown hair.

01:15:24.834 --> 01:15:27.700
Well, what about you
and old Homer Atkinson?

01:15:27.700 --> 01:15:29.300
Homer Atkinson!

01:15:29.300 --> 01:15:30.834
I never liked
Homer Atkinson!

01:15:30.834 --> 01:15:33.166
You loved Homer Atkinson.
Oh! I did not!

01:15:33.166 --> 01:15:36.033
You used to call
him up every night...
You liar!

01:15:36.033 --> 01:15:38.133
And hang up when he answered.

01:15:38.133 --> 01:15:39.300
(tires screeching)
Look out!

01:15:49.767 --> 01:15:52.300
Somebody help me!

01:16:38.600 --> 01:16:42.333
The babies.

01:16:42.333 --> 01:16:44.100
Where are the babies?

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:48.600
Patsy, they're fine.

01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:51.967
John's all right, too.

01:16:51.967 --> 01:16:54.967
You know, you had us scared
here a little bit.

01:16:56.667 --> 01:16:59.000
Tell me.

01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:02.700
Tell me,
are the babies alive?

01:17:02.700 --> 01:17:08.200
Honey, little Randy and
Julie weren't with you.

01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:11.934
John was with you,
and he's okay.

01:17:13.433 --> 01:17:15.433
Yeah.

01:17:15.433 --> 01:17:19.934
Shh, shh...

Very good.

01:18:23.533 --> 01:18:26.033
That's fine.

01:18:26.033 --> 01:18:27.367
That's very good.

01:18:27.367 --> 01:18:28.633
Fine, fine.

01:18:28.633 --> 01:18:30.667
Just as we expected.
It's healing nicely.

01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:35.266
Is it that bad?

01:18:35.266 --> 01:18:38.300
It's not that bad,
honey, it's just the stitches.
Let me look.

01:18:38.300 --> 01:18:40.400
When the stitches come out,

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.834
the scars will heal
very quickly.

01:18:47.433 --> 01:18:50.400
So, this is what
I got to deal with, huh?

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.166
Okay.

01:18:54.633 --> 01:18:57.800
Well, you cut your suit
to fit your cloth.

01:18:57.800 --> 01:19:00.500
Course, later you can have
plastic surgery if you want.

01:19:00.500 --> 01:19:03.166
(laughing)

01:19:03.166 --> 01:19:05.367
Hell, yes,
I want plastic surgery.

01:19:05.367 --> 01:19:07.567
I want all I can get.

01:19:07.567 --> 01:19:10.633
Maybe you can make me
look like Grace Kelly.

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.166
Mr. Bradley...

01:19:28.166 --> 01:19:30.567
I don't care how many times
you play that,

01:19:30.567 --> 01:19:32.867
I can't sing
this man's songs.

01:19:32.867 --> 01:19:34.533
I don't know how
to sing like that.

01:19:34.533 --> 01:19:36.433
Nobody wants you to.

01:19:36.433 --> 01:19:37.967
You can take it
away from him.

01:19:37.967 --> 01:19:39.934
Yeah, the hell
with the demo.

01:19:39.934 --> 01:19:42.700
Steal the son of a bitch.

01:19:42.700 --> 01:19:44.533
I don't understand
why everything

01:19:44.533 --> 01:19:46.567
has to be so
goddamn hard, huh?

01:19:46.567 --> 01:19:48.066
How am I supposed
to do this now?

01:19:48.066 --> 01:19:50.333
Just like you
always do, Patsy.

01:19:50.333 --> 01:19:51.367
Your way.

01:19:51.367 --> 01:19:53.400
Let the song tell the story.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:55.700

Let's try it that way.

Somebody bring me a beer!

01:20:28.900 --> 01:20:30.834
Will somebody bring
the lady a beer?

01:20:30.834 --> 01:20:32.767
Please.
Then we'll go for a take.

It's so pretty.

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:07.600
There, there it is.

01:22:07.600 --> 01:22:09.600
See that white one up there
with the columns?

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:10.867
(chuckling)

01:22:13.734 --> 01:22:15.533
Ain't it the truth?

01:22:17.033 --> 01:22:20.200
I fell in love with it
the minute I saw it.

01:22:20.200 --> 01:22:22.734
You know what I'd like?

01:22:22.734 --> 01:22:25.934
Just a real pale,
pale blue carpet.

01:22:25.934 --> 01:22:27.867
Maybe a couple divans.

01:22:27.867 --> 01:22:30.734
Make kind of a conversation
area, you know?

01:22:30.734 --> 01:22:33.100
(laughing)

01:22:33.100 --> 01:22:34.333
Hey, honey?

01:22:34.333 --> 01:22:38.467
Look at this.
We got a dishwasher.

01:22:38.467 --> 01:22:41.600
And an oven built
right into the wall.

01:22:41.600 --> 01:22:43.700
I want to check a roast,

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:46.333
all I have to do is open
the door like this.

01:22:46.333 --> 01:22:48.000
No more bending over.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:49.967
The Queen of Sheba.

01:22:52.033 --> 01:22:53.567
Say you already bought it?

01:22:53.567 --> 01:22:55.767
Well, I paid down on it.

01:22:55.767 --> 01:22:58.133
Why didn't you tell me?

01:22:58.133 --> 01:23:00.367
I wanted to surprise you.

01:23:02.433 --> 01:23:03.934
You surprised me.

01:23:03.934 --> 01:23:06.633
Well, Randy says the best thing
we can do with our money now

01:23:06.633 --> 01:23:09.800
is put it in bricks and mortar.

01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:19.900
Oh, my Lord, that show
went on forever last night

01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:23.066
and every minute of it
shows in my face today.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:27.834
I'm glad we saved
"Crazy" till the end.

01:23:27.834 --> 01:23:30.300
I think it made
a great encore, don't you?

01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:34.633
Do you love Charlie?

01:23:34.633 --> 01:23:36.100
What?

01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:38.333
Do you love him?

01:23:38.333 --> 01:23:40.300
(chuckling)
Oh, come on.

01:23:40.300 --> 01:23:42.600
I couldn't get along
without Charlie.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.467
How's that song go?

01:23:44.467 --> 01:23:46.467
"He may have been a headache,
but he never was a bore."

01:23:46.467 --> 01:23:48.066
That's Charlie.

01:23:48.066 --> 01:23:49.834
Is that an answer?

01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:54.066
I think Charlie and
I deserve each other.

01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:03.400
Randy:
Looks like Charlie might be
throwing you a little party.

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:04.967
Patsy: Sure does.

01:24:04.967 --> 01:24:06.000
Randy: Take care.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.166
I'll see you
at the session.

01:24:07.166 --> 01:24:08.600
All right.

01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:11.333
Try and get a little sleep
between now and Friday!

01:24:11.333 --> 01:24:12.834
Nighty-night.

01:24:12.834 --> 01:24:15.100
Good night!

01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.333
(music playing)

01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:29.066
Miss Patsy Cline!

01:24:29.066 --> 01:24:30.600
In person!

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:31.600
Hey, honey!

01:24:31.600 --> 01:24:33.433
My baby's home!

01:24:33.433 --> 01:24:34.900
I didn't expect
you home so early.

01:24:34.900 --> 01:24:36.533
We're having a party.
I see that.

01:24:36.533 --> 01:24:38.400
Did you see
my new car out there?

01:24:38.400 --> 01:24:40.533
I bought me an old
clunker for $75

01:24:40.533 --> 01:24:42.867
to drive in the demo
derby tomorrow night.

01:24:42.867 --> 01:24:45.000
Mmm... how are you?

01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:46.734
I think you know
most everybody.

01:24:46.734 --> 01:24:48.300
This here is, uh... Cindy.

01:24:48.300 --> 01:24:49.600
Hi there.

01:24:49.600 --> 01:24:51.300
John and Sarah
you know from work.

01:24:51.300 --> 01:24:53.900
That there's, uh...

01:24:53.900 --> 01:24:56.166
(laughing)
I don't know who that is.

01:24:56.166 --> 01:24:59.200
This is Skip Catmill.
He sold me that car.

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:00.500
Ma'am, I'm glad to meet you.

01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:02.767
Nice to meet you.

01:25:02.767 --> 01:25:04.467
Think I'll get myself a beer.

01:25:04.467 --> 01:25:06.867
How'd it go tonight, baby?
All right.

01:25:06.867 --> 01:25:08.667
This your date, Otis?

01:25:08.667 --> 01:25:10.767
Yeah, goddamn it.
Lucky man.

01:25:10.767 --> 01:25:12.166
Help yourself to food
in there, honey.

01:25:12.166 --> 01:25:13.400
Bought a whole
bunch of Chinese.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:16.000
Now let's us dance one,
Miss Patsy.

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.133
Come on, now, don't be
such an old wet blanket.

01:25:19.133 --> 01:25:20.867
Come.

01:25:23.834 --> 01:25:25.734

Oh! No fair.

01:25:25.734 --> 01:25:27.200
Now we've gotta
wait for the next one.

01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.900
I'm going to bed.
I'm so tired.

01:25:29.900 --> 01:25:31.433
That girl I was dancing with,

01:25:31.433 --> 01:25:34.400
she goes with that
guy from the derby.

01:25:34.400 --> 01:25:36.800
Well, obviously you got me
mixed up with someone

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:38.500
who gives a shit.

01:25:41.567 --> 01:25:43.800
Come on, there you go.

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:45.567

Three Bears.

01:25:47.166 --> 01:25:48.734

01:25:49.934 --> 01:25:51.934
Ooh, you are the most
beautiful little boy.

01:25:51.934 --> 01:25:54.233

01:25:54.233 --> 01:25:55.800

01:25:59.834 --> 01:26:01.500
Hey, kiddo!

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.166
Hope you're all rested up
'cause Otis wants us

01:26:03.166 --> 01:26:05.400
to go out after
the demo derby tonight.

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:07.567
Oh, darling, I'm so tired.

01:26:07.567 --> 01:26:09.400
I feel like I'm
walking on stumps.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:11.233
I gotta sing out there tonight.

01:26:11.233 --> 01:26:13.467

like walking off the stage

01:26:13.467 --> 01:26:15.200
and taking
a busman's holiday.

01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:17.467

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:24.000

a bus ride for his vacation.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:26.934
Oh, hell, it's too
hard to explain.

01:26:26.934 --> 01:26:28.734

01:33:53.934 --> 01:33:55.767
It was better than it's
ever been with you.

01:33:55.767 --> 01:33:59.400
We're gonna get married,
Mr. Motorcycle Man and me.

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:00.400
Uhh!

01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:01.934
Oh!

01:34:01.934 --> 01:34:03.166
Come here.
Charlie!

01:34:03.166 --> 01:34:04.867
Come here.
Stand up!

01:34:04.867 --> 01:34:08.100
(shrieks)
Oh! Charlie! Stop! No!

01:34:08.100 --> 01:34:10.133
Charlie!

01:34:10.133 --> 01:34:12.266
Goddamn it! No!

01:34:12.266 --> 01:34:14.233
Shut up!

01:34:14.233 --> 01:34:16.433
Julie:
Mama?

01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:22.033
Patsy:
Oh, God, baby,
go back to bed.

01:34:27.734 --> 01:34:30.033
(police radio chatter)

01:34:33.834 --> 01:34:36.066
Officer:
Regarding that family
disturbance,

01:34:36.066 --> 01:34:38.767
uh, Unit 17 has
that matter in hand.

01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:53.900
Trade me an eye for one
of them cigarettes?

01:34:56.066 --> 01:34:58.033
What are you
in here for, boy?

01:34:58.033 --> 01:35:00.066
Had an argument
with my wife.

01:35:00.066 --> 01:35:01.934
(chuckling)

01:35:01.934 --> 01:35:05.400
Me, I fell asleep
in a doorway.

01:35:05.400 --> 01:35:06.734
Put them right there.

01:35:06.734 --> 01:35:08.400
You can have one
whenever you want it.

01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:11.934
Thank you,
I appreciate it.

01:35:11.934 --> 01:35:15.133
You look like you got the
whole world on your shoulders.

01:35:15.133 --> 01:35:16.567
Look, you give me
a cigarette,

01:35:16.567 --> 01:35:18.333
all these questions
go with it,

01:35:18.333 --> 01:35:19.967
you can have
the damn thing back.

01:35:19.967 --> 01:35:22.333
I just thought
we'd pass the time.

01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:44.000
Go ahead and take it.

01:35:46.033 --> 01:35:47.767
You only got one in here.

01:35:47.767 --> 01:35:50.100
It's all right,
I smoke too much anyway.

01:35:50.100 --> 01:35:52.500
Thank you.

01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:58.533
Sleep light, don't you?

01:35:58.533 --> 01:36:00.867
Just like my old man.

01:36:03.300 --> 01:36:05.300
He smoked Camels, too.

01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:11.533
He started when he
was nine years old.

01:36:11.533 --> 01:36:13.400
There he was,
he used to tell me,

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:15.767
nine years old
in the fourth grade,

01:36:15.767 --> 01:36:17.400
still wearing knickers.

01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:19.166
Get up in the morning,
first thing he'd do,

01:36:19.166 --> 01:36:20.533
have a cup of coffee
and a cigarette,

01:36:20.533 --> 01:36:22.734
right at the breakfast
table, big as you please.

01:36:22.734 --> 01:36:24.100
(chuckling)

01:36:24.100 --> 01:36:26.233
He was a pisscutter,
my old man was.

01:36:28.133 --> 01:36:31.133
He always could
make me laugh.

01:36:31.133 --> 01:36:34.500
I never knew
who my daddy was.

01:36:34.500 --> 01:36:36.367
I don't think
Mama did either.

01:36:36.367 --> 01:36:39.633
My daddy's
six feet tall...

01:36:39.633 --> 01:36:42.467
When six feet tall was big.

01:36:42.467 --> 01:36:45.000
Had this real
high tenor voice.

01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.533
Could walk halfway around
the block on his hands.

01:36:50.533 --> 01:36:55.066
One morning I was getting
ready for school.

01:36:55.066 --> 01:36:56.500
My daddy stayed home
from work,

01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:59.333
he was at the kitchen
table smoking Camels.

01:36:59.333 --> 01:37:02.734
One right after the other,
he was just eatin' them.

01:37:05.633 --> 01:37:09.967
I went to get some cornflakes
out of the cupboard...

01:37:09.967 --> 01:37:12.700
and heard this noise.

01:37:12.700 --> 01:37:15.433
I thought the whole goddamn
house was falling down.

01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:20.834
I turned around, he'd shot
his self in the head.

01:37:24.433 --> 01:37:26.266
(whispers)
Sweet Jesus!

01:37:28.800 --> 01:37:31.734
I went and sat
on my bed for five days.

01:37:33.433 --> 01:37:36.066
Wouldn't talk to nobody.

01:37:36.066 --> 01:37:39.200
Wouldn't go to his funeral.

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:42.233
On that fifth day, I got up...

01:37:42.233 --> 01:37:44.033
went out the door.

01:37:44.033 --> 01:37:45.767
And I never looked back.

01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:50.533
Just keep on movin'.

01:37:50.533 --> 01:37:51.800
Know what I mean?

01:37:51.800 --> 01:37:53.867
Just keep on movin'.

01:37:59.166 --> 01:38:01.133
I just can't seem
to find anything

01:38:01.133 --> 01:38:04.734
in my life to hold
on to anymore.

01:38:04.734 --> 01:38:08.300
It's like everything is
falling down around me.

01:38:13.633 --> 01:38:15.600
I keep saying to myself,

01:38:15.600 --> 01:38:18.333
"I don't have to lead
that trashy dog's life

01:38:18.333 --> 01:38:20.633
"that my daddy led my mama.

01:38:20.633 --> 01:38:22.900
"I can make things different.

01:38:22.900 --> 01:38:26.100
I can make it right."

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:27.633
And look at me.

01:38:27.633 --> 01:38:30.867
Here I am,
my face all busted up.

01:38:30.867 --> 01:38:34.533
Calling the cops in the
middle of the night.

01:38:34.533 --> 01:38:37.133
And my kid saw it all!

01:38:38.433 --> 01:38:41.300
Oh, Lord, Mama, I don't
know what to do anymore.

01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:43.967
I don't know whether
to divorce him or not.

01:38:43.967 --> 01:38:47.600
All I know is I can't
keep him outta the house
like this forever.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:50.567
Well, this is your baby.
You have to rock it.

01:38:50.567 --> 01:38:53.800
Oh, hell, Mama, I'm not asking
for your goddamn eyeteeth.

01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:55.400
I was just asking
for your opinion.

01:38:55.400 --> 01:38:57.400
(phone ringing)
You talking to your mama.

01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.834
You keep a civil
tongue in your head.

01:38:59.834 --> 01:39:01.734
(ringing)

01:39:04.033 --> 01:39:05.200
Yeah?

01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:07.633
(indistinct voice on phone)

01:39:07.633 --> 01:39:11.400
Oh, no, Randy,
not a big show!
What?

01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:14.000
(Randy)
Nothing I can do, honey, sorry.

01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.600
All right.

01:39:16.600 --> 01:39:19.500
Christ on the cross!
I don't believe it.

01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:21.900
I got recording
sessions starting Friday.

01:39:21.900 --> 01:39:24.166
Now I gotta go to Kansas City
and do a benefit

01:39:24.166 --> 01:39:26.266
for that disc jockey
that died last month.

01:39:26.266 --> 01:39:28.734
Oh, honey, tell 'em
you're just plum wore out.

01:39:32.066 --> 01:39:34.900
I'm sorry I snapped at you.

01:39:34.900 --> 01:39:38.567
Well, if that's the worst thing
that ever happens to me...

01:39:40.667 --> 01:39:42.133
You still like me?

01:39:42.133 --> 01:39:43.700
Now and then.

01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:45.300
You love me?

01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:48.333
Sometimes.

01:39:48.333 --> 01:39:51.800
Oh, Mama, tell me what
to do with my life.

Take a walk.

Charlie, just finish this up
and let's get out of here

01:44:59.667 --> 01:45:01.266

01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:40.633
Hi.

01:45:40.633 --> 01:45:42.567
Oh, Mama, we're still
at the airport.

01:45:42.567 --> 01:45:43.834
The weather bad?

01:45:43.834 --> 01:45:46.166
Yeah, well we've spent
the whole damn night here,

01:45:46.166 --> 01:45:47.900
but the first spot
of good weather we have,

01:45:47.900 --> 01:45:49.367
we're gonna take off.

01:45:49.367 --> 01:45:51.367

with two quarts of ice cream.

01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:56.433
He did?

01:45:56.433 --> 01:45:58.000
He said he missed seeing them.

01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.767
Oh, I knew he couldn't stay
away.

01:45:59.767 --> 01:46:02.066
Yeah, well, he hadn't
had a thing to drink.

01:46:02.066 --> 01:46:03.300
Good as gold.

01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:04.633
(chuckling)

01:46:04.633 --> 01:46:06.633
Hell, Charlie's always good.

01:46:06.633 --> 01:46:08.367
Except when he isn't.

01:46:08.367 --> 01:46:10.567
Yeah, well, now you
just hurry home.

01:46:10.567 --> 01:46:12.567
Well, you give those babies
sugar for me, Mama.

01:46:12.567 --> 01:46:13.567
Of course, I will.

01:46:16.066 --> 01:46:18.300
Whoo!
Let's go!

01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:19.400
Hot dog!

01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:21.800
This beats the hell
out of drivin'!

01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:23.767
Let's get this
show on the road!

01:46:53.066 --> 01:46:55.600
Well, gang, looks like we might
be in for a little fun.

01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:56.967
Just a little turbulence.

01:47:03.367 --> 01:47:04.867
(rattling)

01:47:04.867 --> 01:47:06.600
(engine sputtering)

01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:07.600
Right tank's empty.

01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:09.500
Switching over.

01:47:13.367 --> 01:47:14.800
(sputtering)

01:47:17.700 --> 01:47:19.300
Oh, boy!

01:47:19.300 --> 01:47:21.200
Randy, what the
hell's goin' on?

01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:22.734
What's the matter
with this thing?

01:47:22.734 --> 01:47:24.533
Gotta drop the nose, hold on.

01:47:29.266 --> 01:47:30.767
Kick it over, Randy!

01:47:30.767 --> 01:47:31.967
(engine whines)

01:47:31.967 --> 01:47:33.533
Come on, baby.

01:47:33.533 --> 01:47:34.900
(whines)

01:47:34.900 --> 01:47:36.500
Come on!

01:47:36.500 --> 01:47:37.934
Come on, catch on!

01:47:40.934 --> 01:47:43.200
Randy:
Come on, baby.

01:47:43.200 --> 01:47:45.233
(sputtering)

01:47:45.233 --> 01:47:46.367
Come on!

01:47:46.367 --> 01:47:49.533
(whining, sputtering)

01:47:49.533 --> 01:47:51.066
(engine starts)

01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:55.934
It started.

01:47:55.934 --> 01:47:58.967
Oh, Lord, thank you!

01:47:58.967 --> 01:48:00.800
Yeah! Yeah!
Whoo!

01:48:00.800 --> 01:48:02.900
Attaboy, Randy.
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

01:48:02.900 --> 01:48:04.233
(laughing)

01:48:04.233 --> 01:48:05.800
I almost peed my pants.

01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:07.567
I think I did pee in mine.

01:48:07.567 --> 01:48:09.266
Whoo!
(laughing)

01:48:11.433 --> 01:48:12.967
Oh, my God!

01:48:12.967 --> 01:48:13.934
Oh!

01:48:17.667 --> 01:48:19.133
Charlie!

01:48:30.800 --> 01:48:33.333
(wind whipping)

01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:40.700
(church bells tolling)

01:49:16.500 --> 01:49:21.233
Charlie, you can't work
and take care of two babies.

01:49:26.533 --> 01:49:28.500
Charlie, look at me.

01:49:28.500 --> 01:49:33.100
I'll take the kids
with me for a while.

01:49:33.100 --> 01:49:35.633
I'll be good to them.

01:49:35.633 --> 01:49:37.800
I know it.

01:49:44.066 --> 01:49:46.367
(sniffles)
I know it.

01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:51.700
