WEBVTT

00:06.564 --> 00:08.230
Chin up, Gaston.

00:08.266 --> 00:10.600
Eyes forward.

00:10.635 --> 00:12.301
I said...

00:12.337 --> 00:13.547
Not...

00:13.571 --> 00:14.904
Gaston!

00:14.939 --> 00:16.004
Patty!

00:16.040 --> 00:18.074
Patty, have you seen
Lady Carlisle?

00:18.109 --> 00:19.308
I can't find her anywhere.

00:19.344 --> 00:20.743
Oh, relax, Donald.

00:20.778 --> 00:22.089
I'm sure she's just off
sniffing butts

00:22.113 --> 00:23.679
like the creepy
little mutt that she is.

00:23.715 --> 00:26.282
Lady Carlisle!

00:26.317 --> 00:28.050
Lady Carlisle?

00:28.086 --> 00:29.719
I'm serious.

00:29.754 --> 00:31.921
I turned around for one second
and she just ran off.

00:37.962 --> 00:39.862
Gaston!
Lady Carlisle...

00:43.701 --> 00:45.835
Lady Carlisle.

00:45.870 --> 00:47.081
Better not be out
here fraternizing

00:47.105 --> 00:48.738
with the raccoons again!

00:48.773 --> 00:51.007
I swear, if Gaston's so much
as scuffed his pedicure,

00:51.042 --> 00:52.908
there is gonna be hell to pay!

00:53.845 --> 00:55.678
Gaston!

00:55.713 --> 00:58.114
Gaston!

00:58.149 --> 00:59.015
Gasto--

00:59.050 --> 01:00.650
Gaston, drop it!

01:02.487 --> 01:03.753
I said...

01:04.504 --> 01:06.036
...drop it!

01:12.393 --> 01:13.284
<i>Bones, you're incredible.</i>

01:13.285 --> 01:14.785
I mean, how do you
even have a case file

01:14.786 --> 01:16.302
when you haven't
ID'd the body yet?

01:16.326 --> 01:16.921
No.

01:16.922 --> 01:18.255
This file is
from the archives.

01:18.290 --> 01:20.590
In light of Zack's
new disclosures,

01:20.626 --> 01:23.627
I'm reexamining the evidence
from the lobbyist's murder.

01:23.662 --> 01:25.073
Well, you know what,
you're doing the right thing.

01:25.097 --> 01:26.596
All right, giving Zack
another chance.

01:26.632 --> 01:28.932
I am simply looking
for the truth.

01:28.968 --> 01:31.501
So far, the evidence
is inconclusive.

01:31.537 --> 01:33.370
At least there's
a lot of it there.

01:33.405 --> 01:35.939
No, these files
are not for Zack's case.

01:35.975 --> 01:37.474
They're for my surprise party.

01:37.509 --> 01:39.020
Bones, you do realize
you're not supposed

01:39.044 --> 01:41.078
to plan your own
surprise party?

01:41.113 --> 01:43.347
The traditional custom
is illogical.

01:43.382 --> 01:45.749
Being startled is
unpleasant, while

01:45.784 --> 01:47.651
engineering a surprise
for others has proven

01:47.686 --> 01:49.519
to be quite pleasurable.

01:49.555 --> 01:52.089
Okay, can you at least tell me
what you want for your birthday?

01:52.124 --> 01:54.157
No, my party has a strict
"no gift" policy.

01:54.193 --> 01:55.726
It's right there
on the invitation.

01:55.761 --> 01:57.661
Come on, Bones,
this is a big one.

01:57.696 --> 01:59.096
You're turning 40.

01:59.131 --> 02:00.764
You're flipping
the old odometer.

02:00.799 --> 02:03.000
I can assure you that
I have everything I need.

02:03.035 --> 02:04.101
Ah!

02:04.136 --> 02:05.469
How about one
of those chunky

02:05.504 --> 02:06.970
stone necklaces
you like to wear?

02:07.006 --> 02:08.270
Booth, I'm serious.
So am I.

02:08.306 --> 02:09.547
Well, if you
don't want a thing,

02:09.574 --> 02:11.575
you know, how about,
like, an experience?

02:11.610 --> 02:13.643
I know!
Go to a concert.

02:13.679 --> 02:15.078
No, the Tuvan
throat singers

02:15.114 --> 02:17.014
already passed
through town last month.

02:17.049 --> 02:19.950
<i>Not quite the concert</i>
<i>I was thinking of, Bones.</i>

02:27.559 --> 02:29.126
Who's a good boy?

02:29.161 --> 02:31.294
- Who's a good boy? Yeah.
- Sir?

02:31.330 --> 02:32.574
How many times do I
have to tell you?

02:32.598 --> 02:33.897
Don't be so rough
on his topknot.

02:33.932 --> 02:34.965
Ma'am, I'm just trying

02:35.000 --> 02:36.099
to do my job here, okay?

02:36.135 --> 02:37.300
Techs are flagging

02:37.336 --> 02:38.835
all the drag marks.

02:38.871 --> 02:40.237
This is crazy--
there's evidence

02:40.272 --> 02:41.338
all over the place.

02:41.373 --> 02:42.939
Yeah, including these dogs.

02:42.975 --> 02:45.308
They didn't just snack on
the body, they rolled in it.

02:45.344 --> 02:47.611
Judging from the
multiple layers of predation,

02:47.646 --> 02:50.480
it appears the other
scavengers got to it first.

02:51.950 --> 02:53.917
Given the degree
of tissue decomp,

02:53.952 --> 02:56.520
this body's been out
here three or four days.

02:56.555 --> 02:58.566
Well, the techs said there's
no sign of struggle, so tell you

02:58.590 --> 03:00.001
what, I'm gonna go take
a look on the trails here

03:00.025 --> 03:01.269
and see if I can
find any evidence.

03:01.293 --> 03:03.293
The pronounced <i>linea aspera</i>

03:03.328 --> 03:05.762
of the left femur
indicates the victim is male,

03:05.798 --> 03:08.565
while the degeneration on

03:08.600 --> 03:11.368
the femoral head suggests
he was in his 40s.

03:11.403 --> 03:12.736
Well, this is strange.

03:12.771 --> 03:14.204
There's a piece of plastic

03:14.239 --> 03:16.673
fused to the flesh
on the victim's wrist,

03:16.708 --> 03:19.142
but there's no evidence
of burnt tissue.

03:19.178 --> 03:20.288
Oh, it's almost as mysterious

03:20.312 --> 03:22.179
as Dr. B's birthday party.

03:22.214 --> 03:24.815
Oh, speaking of which,
I know it's a surprise,

03:24.850 --> 03:26.561
but can you give us a
hint on the dress code?

03:26.585 --> 03:27.684
Yes.

03:27.719 --> 03:30.287
Wearing clothes
would be advisable.

03:30.322 --> 03:31.366
Couldn't find a trail, but

03:31.390 --> 03:32.355
found this, huh?

03:32.391 --> 03:33.490
Smoking the dope.

03:33.525 --> 03:34.491
Not surprising.

03:34.526 --> 03:36.359
This is a local teen party spot.

03:36.395 --> 03:38.795
Hey, if there's any weed still
in that pipe, I'll take it.

03:38.831 --> 03:41.131
Back to the lab for
a forensic workup, guys, geez.

03:41.166 --> 03:43.100
Could you all
please stop yammering

03:43.135 --> 03:44.913
and just get on with it?
I have to wash the blood

03:44.937 --> 03:46.403
from Gaston's coat
before it sets.

03:46.438 --> 03:48.305
You need to be patient.
Ma'am, please,

03:48.340 --> 03:49.617
we're trying to
solve a murder here.

03:49.641 --> 03:51.074
If my dog's fur ends up pink,

03:51.110 --> 03:53.043
I promise you,
there will be hell to pay.

03:53.078 --> 03:55.545
You know what, I'm just gonna
expedite the process here, okay?

03:55.581 --> 03:59.116
Thank you, finally
somebody's listening to me.

03:59.151 --> 04:00.851
Stop! What are you doing?
Whoa!

04:00.886 --> 04:02.263
It took me two years
to grow out that coat!

04:02.287 --> 04:03.121
Whoa, whoa!

04:03.122 --> 04:04.387
Hey, ma'am...
Ma'am, ma'am.

04:04.423 --> 04:06.423
Just let go
of my clippers...

04:10.329 --> 04:11.529
Is it as bad as I think it is?

04:46.332 --> 04:48.323
This body shows extensive

04:48.324 --> 04:51.058
evidence of postmortem
blunt force trauma.

04:51.094 --> 04:53.361
I found multiple fractures

04:53.396 --> 04:55.630
on the left tibia
and fibula.

04:57.467 --> 04:59.467
Another
unknown number? Yes.

04:59.502 --> 05:00.635
I want to ignore.

05:00.670 --> 05:02.570
Also, the right ribs
three through six,

05:02.605 --> 05:04.805
the right radius,
and the ulnae.

05:04.841 --> 05:06.118
And don't get me
started on the tissue.

05:06.142 --> 05:07.308
Whatever the dogs didn't eat

05:07.343 --> 05:09.644
was bruised, scraped
or punctured.

05:09.679 --> 05:11.379
The location
of the trauma suggests

05:11.414 --> 05:12.813
the body was dragged on both

05:12.849 --> 05:14.715
anterior and posterior planes.

05:14.751 --> 05:17.618
Dr. Brennan, I've
been meaning to ask,

05:17.654 --> 05:18.819
would it be okay
if I put you

05:18.855 --> 05:20.021
down as a reference?

05:20.056 --> 05:21.222
Now that I've finally

05:21.257 --> 05:22.490
completed my PhD,

05:22.525 --> 05:24.058
I've applied for a job

05:24.093 --> 05:26.560
as lead forensic
anthropologist at the NFL.

05:26.596 --> 05:28.062
Whoa, they need

05:28.097 --> 05:30.531
forensic anthropologists
in pro football?

05:30.566 --> 05:32.633
I think the NFL
Daisy's referring to

05:32.669 --> 05:34.402
is the National Forensic Lab.

05:34.437 --> 05:36.704
I will be a reference, Dr. Wick,

05:36.739 --> 05:39.140
but I advise you
not to get your hopes up.

05:39.175 --> 05:40.708
In light
of your young age,

05:40.743 --> 05:42.276
landing a job

05:42.312 --> 05:45.279
of that status would be
a long shot at best.

05:45.315 --> 05:47.782
Uh, didn't you get your job here

05:47.817 --> 05:48.992
when you were still
in your 20s?

05:49.016 --> 05:49.651
Yes.

05:49.652 --> 05:52.687
But that was clearly
an exceptional circumstance.

05:53.923 --> 05:55.990
Angela, don't you need
to get that?

05:56.025 --> 05:57.992
Sorry, yeah, um...

05:58.027 --> 06:01.295
Okay, this is the third time
that this unknown number

06:01.331 --> 06:02.530
has called today.

06:02.565 --> 06:03.998
Hey, good news.

06:04.033 --> 06:05.411
I was able to pull prints off
that pipe,

06:05.435 --> 06:06.734
so I sent it

06:06.769 --> 06:08.936
to Booth and Aubrey.

06:09.939 --> 06:12.807
You're... asymmetrical.

06:12.842 --> 06:15.643
Ange, you said it was
barely noticeable.

06:15.678 --> 06:17.978
Anyway, based on the
colonization of mold spores

06:18.014 --> 06:21.816
on the marijuana that was
in the pipe, I was able

06:21.851 --> 06:24.085
to determine
that it was last smoked,

06:24.120 --> 06:26.620
like, 80 hours ago, so...

06:26.656 --> 06:29.357
So whoever was smoking
in the woods was probably there

06:29.392 --> 06:31.759
right around the victim's
time of death.

06:33.162 --> 06:37.531
I'm s-s-sorry, Dr. Hodgins.

06:37.567 --> 06:39.734
Okay. All right.

06:51.214 --> 06:52.813
You Randy Stringer?

06:52.849 --> 06:54.815
Uh, yeah.
But I didn't call an Uber.

06:54.851 --> 06:56.117
Oh, I'm not Uber.

06:56.152 --> 06:57.918
FBI. Here to ask you
a few questions

06:57.954 --> 06:59.353
about last Friday night.

06:59.389 --> 07:00.799
We have evidence that
you were in the woods

07:00.823 --> 07:02.656
at Greenwood Barrens.
So?

07:02.692 --> 07:05.326
Far as I know, there's no law
against communing with nature.

07:05.361 --> 07:06.894
Well, unfortunately for you,

07:06.929 --> 07:08.562
there is a law against drugs.

07:08.598 --> 07:09.897
We found your marijuana pipe.

07:09.932 --> 07:11.165
According to your record,

07:11.200 --> 07:12.733
you got picked up
twice for selling LSD

07:12.769 --> 07:15.369
and once for assault
with a deadly weapon.

07:15.405 --> 07:17.238
Nah, nah.
I'll tell you what happened.

07:17.273 --> 07:19.106
I was in the parking lot
at a Phish show,

07:19.142 --> 07:21.008
cutting up some salami
with my pocketknife,

07:21.043 --> 07:22.877
when the pigs nabbed me
for dealing.

07:22.912 --> 07:25.913
Pigs?
What is this, 1969?

07:25.948 --> 07:28.160
I'm telling you, man, the only
thing I assaulted that day

07:28.184 --> 07:30.117
was some nice Soppresatta.

07:30.153 --> 07:32.720
Or, uh, maybe it was pepperoni.
Randy.

07:32.755 --> 07:34.522
Do you recall seeing
anything unusual

07:34.557 --> 07:36.123
in the woods that night?

07:37.026 --> 07:39.727
Well, there was one thing.

07:39.762 --> 07:42.830
Uh, a dude walked in
with a flashlight.

07:42.865 --> 07:46.066
At least I think it was a dude;
it was too dark to tell.

07:46.102 --> 07:48.836
Any idea what time it was?
Where he was coming from?

07:48.871 --> 07:52.673
Yeah, uh, he came in from the,
uh...

07:52.708 --> 07:55.042
well, the northwest corner,

07:55.077 --> 07:57.711
probably around 11:30 or so,

07:57.747 --> 08:00.347
'cause Animation Domination
was on by the time I got home.

08:01.284 --> 08:02.461
Uh, what's this about, anyway?

08:02.485 --> 08:04.518
Someone dumped a body
in those woods.

08:04.554 --> 08:07.154
Talk about littering.

08:07.190 --> 08:10.524
When will people learn
to respect Mother Earth?

08:12.962 --> 08:14.740
How is the facial
reconstruction coming?

08:14.764 --> 08:16.063
Oh, I didn't need one.

08:16.098 --> 08:18.032
It turns out that
that thing that Cam found

08:18.067 --> 08:19.567
fused to the victim's wrist

08:19.602 --> 08:20.901
was a skin-mounted

08:20.937 --> 08:22.870
bio-electronic fitness monitor.

08:22.905 --> 08:25.506
If Angie can figure out a way
to access it wirelessly,

08:25.541 --> 08:27.641
she may be able
to find the victim's ID.

08:27.677 --> 08:29.176
Oh!

08:29.212 --> 08:32.346
Hodgins, your eyebrow appears
to have grown back.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.815
Sorry to ruin your laugh-fest,
there, but, yeah.

08:34.851 --> 08:37.485
I constructed a replacement
using hair from my own beard.

08:39.322 --> 08:40.688
Really?

08:40.722 --> 08:42.256
Oh, here we go again.

08:43.525 --> 08:45.993
Oh, come on.

08:46.028 --> 08:48.929
Are you kidding me?

08:48.965 --> 08:50.731
Yeah. Hi.

08:50.766 --> 08:52.867
Listen, I don't have
any credit card debt,

08:52.902 --> 08:55.936
and I'm-I'm just not interested
in buying one of your cruises,

08:55.972 --> 08:57.304
so...

08:57.340 --> 08:59.406
Are you sure you're calling
for me?

08:59.442 --> 09:01.208
Yeah. No, that-that...

09:01.244 --> 09:03.944
Can you give me one second?

09:03.980 --> 09:06.380
Uh...

09:06.415 --> 09:08.883
Maybe she is buying a cruise.

09:08.918 --> 09:11.753
I was under the impression
that bio-electronic devices

09:11.754 --> 09:14.052
were not yet available
to the consumer market.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.491
Yeah, as far as I know, they're not,
but, I don't know, maybe our victim

09:16.526 --> 09:18.192
had a connection
to the tech world.

09:20.563 --> 09:22.196
- Um...
- Wow.

09:22.231 --> 09:23.797
You guys are never gonna
believe this,

09:23.833 --> 09:26.934
but I just won
a MacArthur Fellowship.

09:26.969 --> 09:30.938
You know, the one that everyone
calls the "genius grant"?

09:30.973 --> 09:33.240
Congratulations, Angie!

09:33.276 --> 09:35.042
- That's unbelievable!
- Truly!

09:35.077 --> 09:38.312
Uh, MacArthur is one of the most
prestigious awards

09:38.347 --> 09:39.480
a scientist can get.

09:39.515 --> 09:41.382
Yeah, I know, um... wow.

09:41.417 --> 09:45.219
They said my work with the
Angelatron was "groundbreaking."

09:45.254 --> 09:47.788
Good job, Ange!

09:47.823 --> 09:50.190
See? I always knew
I married a genius.

09:50.226 --> 09:51.792
Well, technically you did not.

09:51.827 --> 09:54.962
Though Angela
is incredibly talented.

09:54.997 --> 09:56.297
Thank you?

09:56.332 --> 09:58.299
Dr. B.
Angie's your best friend.

09:58.334 --> 09:59.845
You got to at least try
to be happy for her.

09:59.869 --> 10:00.701
I am.

10:00.736 --> 10:03.137
It's simply
that I never imagined

10:03.172 --> 10:05.472
you would ever achieve
this honor,

10:05.508 --> 10:07.174
let alone before I did.

10:08.244 --> 10:10.411
In other news,

10:10.446 --> 10:12.479
it looks like I found
the wireless password

10:12.515 --> 10:14.148
for the fitness monitor.

10:14.183 --> 10:17.151
It belonged to an Ian Goldberg.

10:18.321 --> 10:21.155
Looks like he was
some kind of pioneer

10:21.190 --> 10:23.023
in the field of
artificial intelligence.

10:23.059 --> 10:24.191
Yeah, no.

10:24.226 --> 10:25.826
I knew this name
sounded familiar.

10:25.861 --> 10:27.595
He's the guy that makes
those awesome robots

10:27.630 --> 10:29.029
that work with
the children

10:29.065 --> 10:30.364
on the autism spectrum.

10:30.399 --> 10:31.765
Let's check it out.

10:35.338 --> 10:36.971
Good morning, Riley.

10:37.006 --> 10:39.173
Shall we practice
our introductions?

10:39.208 --> 10:41.008
To paraphrase Stephen Hawking,

10:41.043 --> 10:42.810
our focus at Social Cybernetics

10:42.845 --> 10:44.778
isn't so much
artificial intelligence...

10:44.814 --> 10:46.313
as beneficial intelligence.

10:46.349 --> 10:48.482
For a child
on the autism spectrum,

10:48.517 --> 10:50.751
social interactions
can be overwhelming,

10:50.786 --> 10:54.121
but robots like AMI provide
a simple, stress-free

10:54.156 --> 10:56.023
interface,
which allows them to make

10:56.058 --> 10:57.124
great strides.

10:57.159 --> 10:58.492
Good work, Riley.

11:02.198 --> 11:04.431
There's someone
who deserves the genius grant.

11:04.467 --> 11:07.001
Who would want to kill a guy
like this?

11:16.576 --> 11:18.353
You know, you're awfully quiet.

11:18.377 --> 11:19.643
You're not upset about Angela

11:19.679 --> 11:21.312
winning that whole
McDonald's award?

11:21.347 --> 11:22.680
MacArthur.

11:22.715 --> 11:23.681
No, not in the slightest.

11:23.716 --> 11:26.083
I am simply focused

11:26.118 --> 11:27.518
on planning my party.

11:27.553 --> 11:28.953
It's not every day

11:28.988 --> 11:29.887
that one turns 40.

11:29.922 --> 11:31.155
Oh.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.089
Hello.

11:32.124 --> 11:33.324
Sorry to bug you, Dr. B,

11:33.359 --> 11:34.425
but I wanted to show you

11:34.460 --> 11:36.160
three antemortem contusions

11:36.195 --> 11:37.428
I found hidden

11:37.463 --> 11:38.429
in the blunt force trauma

11:38.464 --> 11:39.464
on the back of the skull.

11:39.498 --> 11:40.598
See these marks

11:40.633 --> 11:42.800
on the occipital
and left parietal?

11:42.835 --> 11:45.202
Based on the shape and spacing,

11:45.238 --> 11:48.138
they were caused
by metacarpophalangeal joints

11:48.174 --> 11:49.473
two through four.

11:49.508 --> 11:51.208
Someone punched our victim.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.521
What are you talking about?
In the back of the head?

11:52.545 --> 11:53.577
That's a rookie move.

11:53.613 --> 11:54.945
Looking at the force profile,

11:54.981 --> 11:56.747
I'm guessing whoever did it

11:56.782 --> 11:58.148
sustained a hand injury.

11:58.184 --> 11:59.617
Thank you, Dr. Wick.

12:00.853 --> 12:02.753
So, let me ask you a question.

12:02.788 --> 12:05.289
What's with this
Social Cybernetics place?

12:05.324 --> 12:06.690
I mean, what, are we talking,

12:06.726 --> 12:09.693
like, full-on C-3PO or R2-D2?
What?

12:09.729 --> 12:12.129
I have no idea what that means,
but Ian Goldberg's work

12:12.164 --> 12:13.964
was in artificial intelligence.

12:14.000 --> 12:18.369
The robots he created have
complicated neural networks

12:18.404 --> 12:20.037
that are designed to emulate

12:20.072 --> 12:20.971
the human brain.

12:21.007 --> 12:23.040
Come on, no robot's brain

12:23.075 --> 12:24.608
i-is ever gonna beat
a human one.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.510
Are you kidding me?
At the end of the day,

12:26.545 --> 12:27.511
humans have something

12:27.546 --> 12:29.079
that robots will never have.

12:29.115 --> 12:30.714
What?
The soul.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.116
The existence of a soul

12:32.151 --> 12:34.184
has never been proven
with scientific data.

12:34.220 --> 12:35.497
Soul is not something
you prove, Bo...

12:36.656 --> 12:37.788
H-Hey! Listen to that!

12:37.823 --> 12:38.789
It's something you feel.

12:38.824 --> 12:39.990
Do you hear that?!

12:40.026 --> 12:41.303
That's our song! Listen.

12:41.327 --> 12:42.793
You hear the soul in that?

12:42.828 --> 12:44.461
♪ Hot blooded ♪

12:44.497 --> 12:46.263
♪ Catch it and see ♪

12:46.299 --> 12:49.767
♪ I got a fever of 103 ♪

12:49.802 --> 12:52.169
♪ Come on, baby ♪

12:52.204 --> 12:54.238
♪ Do you do more than dance? ♪

12:54.273 --> 12:56.018
I can't believe it.
I've known Ian half my life.

12:56.042 --> 12:57.341
We've worked
on AMI's development

12:57.376 --> 12:59.443
ever since our days at MIT.
Who's Amy?

12:59.478 --> 13:02.346
The name is an acronym for
Advanced Modular Intelligence.

13:02.381 --> 13:03.647
Of course.

13:03.683 --> 13:05.249
Here, let me
introduce you.

13:07.420 --> 13:08.519
AMI, please
come say hello

13:08.554 --> 13:10.220
to Agent Booth
and Dr. Brennan.

13:13.726 --> 13:16.660
That's...
really amazing.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.395
Hello, Agent Booth,

13:18.431 --> 13:19.530
Dr. Brennan.

13:19.565 --> 13:20.609
Look at that.
I am very pleased

13:20.633 --> 13:22.032
to meet you.

13:22.068 --> 13:23.312
AMI, your enunciation
and speech patterns

13:23.336 --> 13:24.336
are incredibly nuanced.

13:24.370 --> 13:25.402
I am also fluent

13:25.438 --> 13:26.770
in eight languages.

13:26.806 --> 13:28.005
Whoa.
Really?

13:28.040 --> 13:28.973
Well, so am I.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.040
Very impressive.

13:30.076 --> 13:31.108
For a human.

13:31.143 --> 13:32.776
As we continue to educate AMI

13:32.812 --> 13:34.044
on the subtleties

13:34.080 --> 13:35.379
of human emotions,

13:35.414 --> 13:36.992
I'm afraid she's picked up
a few bad habits.

13:37.016 --> 13:39.249
This robot can recognize
facial expressions?

13:39.285 --> 13:41.585
Yeah, better than most people.

13:41.620 --> 13:43.087
AMI, please tell us
what you observe.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.122
Dr. Brennan appears

13:44.156 --> 13:46.390
78% curious

13:46.425 --> 13:47.558
and 22% jealous.

13:47.593 --> 13:49.059
Agent Booth is

13:49.095 --> 13:51.195
94% amused

13:51.230 --> 13:52.363
and six percent skeptical.

13:52.398 --> 13:53.931
And you, Kate, are

13:53.966 --> 13:55.299
100% nervous.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.134
Oh, well,
of course I am.

13:57.169 --> 13:58.449
I'm being questioned by the FBI.

13:59.772 --> 14:01.605
Thank you, AMI.
Your work here is done.

14:03.209 --> 14:07.244
So, um, you and Ian didn't
have any bad blood, did you?

14:07.279 --> 14:10.714
Oh, no, we had a very fruitful
working relationship.

14:10.750 --> 14:12.549
Had Ian lived,
I am confident that

14:12.585 --> 14:13.662
we would have
reached singularity

14:13.686 --> 14:14.985
within the next decade.

14:15.021 --> 14:16.498
- Sorry, singularity?
- Uh, singularity

14:16.522 --> 14:18.522
is when intelligent machines

14:18.557 --> 14:20.424
become indistinguishable
from humans.

14:20.459 --> 14:22.092
So, did you notice
anything unusual

14:22.128 --> 14:23.627
about Ian's behavior
last Friday?

14:23.662 --> 14:24.928
Oh, unfortunately,

14:24.964 --> 14:27.131
I was out of town,
delivering a speech.

14:27.166 --> 14:28.532
But I can give you his

14:28.567 --> 14:30.401
online calendar.

14:30.436 --> 14:31.668
Ian was highly scheduled,

14:31.704 --> 14:34.020
so I'm sure everything
that he did should be on there.

14:34.021 --> 14:35.072
Bones, Bones,
take a look

14:35.107 --> 14:36.667
at that guy with the...
the wrist brace.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.577
Excuse me, sir.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.479
Yeah. How'd you get that

14:42.515 --> 14:43.759
injury on your wrist?
It's okay, Alan,

14:43.783 --> 14:46.383
they're with the FBI.

14:46.419 --> 14:47.951
Then they should be smart enough

14:47.987 --> 14:50.454
to realize that it
isn't an injury at all.

14:50.489 --> 14:51.955
It's carpal tunnel.

14:51.991 --> 14:54.058
You know, from sitting
at a computer all day.

14:54.093 --> 14:56.326
A compressed median
nerve would not cause

14:56.362 --> 14:57.628
the knuckles to swell.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.163
I'm a little bit bloated,
so what?

14:59.198 --> 15:00.297
Ow!

15:00.332 --> 15:02.099
Whoa!
Ow! You are hurting me.

15:02.134 --> 15:03.769
Booth, it's just
as I suspected.

15:03.793 --> 15:04.235
Yeah.

15:04.236 --> 15:05.803
His second and third metacarpals

15:05.838 --> 15:07.504
show significant
angulation.

15:07.540 --> 15:08.672
Speak English, please.

15:08.707 --> 15:10.040
This man does not suffer

15:10.076 --> 15:12.142
from carpal tunnel syndrome,

15:12.178 --> 15:13.555
but he does have
a boxer's fracture.

15:13.579 --> 15:16.647
Don't need a robot
to figure that out.

15:21.720 --> 15:23.153
I've reviewed
your medical records,

15:23.189 --> 15:25.389
Alan, and the injuries
to your metacarpals

15:25.424 --> 15:27.091
are an exact match

15:27.126 --> 15:28.559
for the bruises on Ian's skull.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.660
Fine.

15:29.695 --> 15:30.961
So I hit him.

15:30.996 --> 15:32.407
That doesn't make me
guilty of murder.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.831
Well, I'm not sure
I trust the guy

15:33.866 --> 15:35.577
that sucker-punched his boss
in the back of the head.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.667
I had just worked

15:36.702 --> 15:39.069
my third 16-hour day in a row

15:39.105 --> 15:40.471
when Ian tried
to force me

15:40.506 --> 15:41.772
to work through
the weekend.

15:41.807 --> 15:43.707
- I was tired. I lost it.
- Really?

15:43.742 --> 15:45.909
You know what I think?
I think you mixed it up with Ian

15:45.945 --> 15:47.601
and you ended up killing him,
that's what I think.

15:47.602 --> 15:49.495
That's ridiculous.

15:49.519 --> 15:50.915
If one of my
employees

15:50.916 --> 15:54.418
struck me on the skull,
I'd have fired him on the spot.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.987
Please. Do you know how hard
it would be to replace me?

15:57.022 --> 15:59.705
I am far and away the
best coder they have.

15:59.729 --> 16:00.325
That's great.

16:00.326 --> 16:01.611
Where were you
last Friday night?

16:01.635 --> 16:02.594
Same place I always am--

16:02.595 --> 16:04.128
my desk at Social Cybernetics

16:04.163 --> 16:06.082
where I was coding
all night long.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.803
Well, our team
will have to verify that.

16:07.827 --> 16:08.900
Yeah. Sure.
Go right ahead.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.334
But if you
want to find

16:10.369 --> 16:13.337
the actual killer,
you ought to be questioning

16:13.372 --> 16:15.739
those nuts from
Stop the Robopocalypse.

16:15.774 --> 16:16.774
The Roba what?

16:16.809 --> 16:18.509
Robopocalypse.
They are

16:18.544 --> 16:21.545
a radical group
who believe that A.I.

16:21.580 --> 16:24.715
is out to destroy humanity
by enslaving the human race.

16:24.750 --> 16:26.517
Yes, and Ian's

16:26.552 --> 16:28.719
favorite hobby was
going onto their blogs

16:28.754 --> 16:31.054
and baiting them into fights.
The same Ian

16:31.090 --> 16:32.934
that built these robots that
helped these autistic kids?

16:32.958 --> 16:34.791
I know-- that seems
out of character.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.360
Not if you knew the guy.

16:36.395 --> 16:38.073
Ian's death may have been
a loss to the field

16:38.097 --> 16:41.465
of artificial intelligence,
but in reality...

16:41.500 --> 16:44.101
the guy was a dink.

16:44.136 --> 16:45.903
Did he just say "dink"?

16:45.938 --> 16:47.471
I think he did.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.675
Any word from the NFL?

16:51.710 --> 16:53.143
Not yet.

16:53.179 --> 16:55.145
But I can't stop
stressing about it.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.613
Even if they do call
Dr. Brennan

16:56.649 --> 16:59.550
for a reference,
what if it backfires?

16:59.585 --> 17:02.286
You know, she does have
a tendency to be blunt.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.721
That is one way of putting it.

17:04.757 --> 17:08.025
Do you think it'll seem like
a red flag if I call the NFL

17:08.060 --> 17:11.094
and I ask them to use you
as a reference instead?

17:11.130 --> 17:12.996
I think you should
focus on your work

17:13.031 --> 17:14.998
and try not to
worry so much.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.468
Well, there certainly is
plenty to focus on.

17:18.503 --> 17:20.871
12 separate instances
of blunt force trauma,

17:20.906 --> 17:22.705
and yet there's
no consistency

17:22.741 --> 17:24.775
in directionality
or size.

17:24.810 --> 17:27.778
It's like the victim was hit
with a bunch of different objects

17:27.813 --> 17:30.347
from... multiple angles.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.482
After he was already dead?

17:32.518 --> 17:34.618
Yes and no.
There's also evidence

17:34.653 --> 17:36.753
of perimortem blunt force trauma

17:36.789 --> 17:39.289
on the frontal bone
at the coronal suture.

17:39.325 --> 17:43.327
It must have been obscured
by all the postmortem damage.

17:43.362 --> 17:45.896
Huh. I'll have Hodgins swab,

17:45.931 --> 17:47.531
see if we can identify

17:47.566 --> 17:49.700
the murder weapon.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.835
Oh, and, Daisy...

17:51.870 --> 17:53.203
if...

17:53.239 --> 17:55.372
the NFL doesn't hire you...

17:55.407 --> 17:57.641
you'll always have a job here.

18:07.353 --> 18:09.386
Hey, uh, according
to Alan's computer,

18:09.421 --> 18:11.121
he was telling the truth.

18:11.156 --> 18:13.323
He was logged in and working
until 4:00 a.m.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.459
last Friday night.
The guy's a coder--

18:15.494 --> 18:17.427
you don't think he
could have faked that?

18:17.463 --> 18:19.763
With Social Cybernetics'
network security?

18:19.798 --> 18:22.165
It's not likely.
Great. So all we got

18:22.201 --> 18:25.369
are a bunch of dead ends
and a creepy talking robot.

18:25.404 --> 18:27.371
What, are you
afraid of AMI?

18:27.406 --> 18:29.539
You're not?
Well, have you met her?

18:29.575 --> 18:32.109
She's actually
pretty adorable.

18:32.144 --> 18:33.844
Yeah, now--
but in another few years,

18:33.879 --> 18:35.457
AMI and her little buddies start
getting more advanced,

18:35.481 --> 18:37.714
then we stop being the
smartest thing on the planet.

18:37.750 --> 18:40.617
Wow, Aubrey, I never knew
you were so paranoid.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.787
Hey, you know
that anti-A.I. group,

18:43.822 --> 18:45.922
Stop the Robopocalypse?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.691
Why? Are you thinking
of joining?

18:47.726 --> 18:49.059
That's funny.

18:49.094 --> 18:50.627
It turns out their leader

18:50.663 --> 18:52.696
crashed one of Ian's
speaking engagements last year

18:52.731 --> 18:54.965
and struck him in the leg
with a baseball bat.

18:55.000 --> 18:58.502
Guy by the name
of Matthew Coburn.

18:58.537 --> 19:01.271
I wish you'd told me you
were into model trains.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.540
I would have brought
Lance Jr. with me.

19:03.575 --> 19:05.575
I am not playing
with trains, Daisy.

19:05.611 --> 19:07.077
I am making a map.

19:07.112 --> 19:08.812
Since Booth couldn't
track the drag marks,

19:08.847 --> 19:11.014
I customized
an old Jeffersonian display

19:11.050 --> 19:13.228
so it can match the particulates
found in Ian's injuries

19:13.252 --> 19:15.686
to specific locations
in the woods. For example,

19:15.721 --> 19:17.821
we got birch sap in the victim's
left ulna fracture,

19:17.856 --> 19:19.623
and the scrapes
on his legs have pollen

19:19.658 --> 19:21.525
from these swamp azaleas.

19:21.560 --> 19:23.727
Problem is, there are
so many random drag marks,

19:23.762 --> 19:25.529
finding a pattern
will be next to impossible.

19:25.564 --> 19:27.297
It's like we're looking
at chaos theory.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.299
I have to say...

19:29.335 --> 19:31.835
it's good to see you back to
your old self, Dr. Hodgins.

19:31.870 --> 19:34.671
And I wasn't talking about
your eyebrow or your legs.

19:34.707 --> 19:36.573
Thank you, Daisy.
I think it just, you know,

19:36.608 --> 19:39.409
took me a while to realize
that my legs are merely a way

19:39.445 --> 19:41.244
for me to carry around
what's in here.

19:41.280 --> 19:42.979
And, you know, what's in here.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.648
I'm happy for you.

19:44.683 --> 19:47.117
And I really need
your advice.

19:47.152 --> 19:49.564
Oh, I would say "shoot," but you
did once put a bullet in my arm.

19:49.588 --> 19:51.655
I need you to
level with me.

19:51.690 --> 19:53.857
Do you think I
really have a chance

19:53.892 --> 19:55.592
of landing that lead
anthropologist job?

19:55.627 --> 19:57.394
'Cause the thought
of not getting it

19:57.429 --> 19:59.162
makes me feel like
such a failure.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.399
Daisy, look, I know that
you and I have a history of...

20:02.434 --> 20:03.900
getting on each other's nerves,

20:03.936 --> 20:06.737
but I do think you're
a highly skilled scientist.

20:06.772 --> 20:08.405
I agree. But Dr. Brennan

20:08.440 --> 20:10.173
was already running
the Jeffersonian

20:10.209 --> 20:12.409
when she was five
years younger than me.

20:12.444 --> 20:14.578
Yes, but life
is not a competition, Daisy.

20:14.613 --> 20:17.114
Trust me, if I've learned
anything being in this chair,

20:17.149 --> 20:20.517
it's that happiness comes
from accepting what you have.

20:20.552 --> 20:23.353
But what if what I have is
just one big question mark?

20:23.389 --> 20:24.888
Yeah.
Tell me about it.

20:24.923 --> 20:26.022
Look at this thing.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.758
I mean, it's so insane

20:27.793 --> 20:30.927
that it's actually
kind of brilliant.

20:30.963 --> 20:32.796
Well, our victim was
a computer genius.

20:32.831 --> 20:35.265
Chances are his killer
was pretty smart, too.

20:36.468 --> 20:38.034
Which means they
could have purposefully

20:38.070 --> 20:39.770
hauled Ian's body
through the woods

20:39.805 --> 20:41.972
in order to obscure
the other evidence.

20:42.703 --> 20:45.184
You're really not gonna get your
own wife a birthday present?

20:45.252 --> 20:47.185
Bones swears she doesn't
want anything, so...

20:47.381 --> 20:49.248
All right. Well, I mean...

20:49.283 --> 20:50.850
I'm no expert on women,

20:50.885 --> 20:53.619
but that really sounds
like a trap to me.

20:53.654 --> 20:57.089
Is this really where
the head of Robopocalypse lives,

20:57.125 --> 20:59.809
in the middle
of this industrial wasteland?

20:59.833 --> 21:02.862
Well, this is where Angela tracked down
his, uh, Wi-Fi coordinates,

21:02.897 --> 21:05.331
so he's got to
be in there.

21:05.366 --> 21:07.366
Am I the only one
smelling barbecue here?

21:07.401 --> 21:10.202
Good nose, Aubrey.

21:16.677 --> 21:17.877
Matthew Coburn?

21:18.579 --> 21:19.612
How you doing?

21:19.647 --> 21:21.580
Uh, we'd like to have
a word with you.

22:36.757 --> 22:38.557
Come on, Matthew,
give it up, will you?

22:39.760 --> 22:41.060
Down!

22:42.230 --> 22:43.796
You're kiddin' me, huh?
Geez.

22:43.831 --> 22:45.798
Get off my partner.
Come on, let's go.

22:45.833 --> 22:48.200
Thanks for showing up,
Aubrey.

22:48.236 --> 22:49.468
Anytime.

22:49.503 --> 22:51.170
Hold on.

22:55.810 --> 22:58.477
Just because I blogged about the
military smart drone program

22:58.512 --> 23:00.279
doesn't make me guilty
of treason.

23:00.314 --> 23:02.448
I had no idea those files
were classified.

23:02.483 --> 23:05.050
We didn't bring you in here
because of your blog, Matthew.

23:05.086 --> 23:07.820
You're under investigation for
the murder of Ian Goldberg.

23:07.855 --> 23:09.655
Why would I want to kill him?

23:09.690 --> 23:11.257
You tell me.

23:11.292 --> 23:13.270
You're the one who attacked him
with the baseball bat.

23:13.294 --> 23:15.895
After that, you lost
your job, your house,

23:15.930 --> 23:17.563
your wife filed for divorce.

23:17.598 --> 23:19.431
I think you blamed Ian for that,

23:19.467 --> 23:21.934
so you decided to come back and
finish him off.

23:21.969 --> 23:23.969
I never meant to hurt Ian.

23:24.005 --> 23:25.137
I tried to smash
his robot,

23:25.172 --> 23:28.007
only he stepped in
to protect the damn thing.

23:28.042 --> 23:30.676
Well, destruction of
property is still a felony.

23:30.711 --> 23:32.456
You'd want to destroy robots,
too, if you realized

23:32.480 --> 23:35.214
what the government
was doing with them.

23:35.249 --> 23:36.649
They're weaponizing this stuff.

23:36.684 --> 23:39.752
Turning them into
autonomous robot killers.

23:40.721 --> 23:42.254
Hold... hold on a second here.

23:42.290 --> 23:43.856
I-Ian didn't even make weapons.

23:43.891 --> 23:47.259
I mean, the guy made robots
that helped autistic kids.

23:47.295 --> 23:48.861
So he said.

23:48.896 --> 23:50.540
Guys like Ian always claim
that they're trying

23:50.564 --> 23:52.464
to save the world,
but the only thing

23:52.500 --> 23:53.866
they care about is selling out

23:53.901 --> 23:55.734
to the highest bidder.
Do you know how many

23:55.770 --> 23:57.136
"amazing scientific discoveries"

23:57.171 --> 23:59.138
were turned into
weapons of mass destruction?

23:59.173 --> 24:01.607
Einstein's relativity
became the atom bomb,

24:01.642 --> 24:04.329
an amazing new garden herbicide
turned into Agent Orange...

24:04.330 --> 24:07.447
Mr. Coburn, where were you
last Friday night?

24:07.481 --> 24:09.882
In my RV,

24:09.917 --> 24:12.084
writing a very important post
about why people should

24:12.119 --> 24:14.420
take action to stop men
like Ian Goldberg

24:14.455 --> 24:16.121
before it's too late!

24:16.157 --> 24:19.224
Don't worry. I'm gonna
take action, all right.

24:20.594 --> 24:23.195
By holding you right here.

24:35.343 --> 24:36.909
Dr. Brennan...

24:36.944 --> 24:38.644
No, Daisy.
I still have not heard

24:38.679 --> 24:40.346
from the National Forensic Lab.

24:40.381 --> 24:43.115
I will inform you
the minute I do.

24:43.150 --> 24:45.351
Have you found any evidence
of dislocation?

24:45.386 --> 24:47.653
Both the wrists and elbows
show a remarkable number

24:47.688 --> 24:49.021
of hairline fractures.

24:49.056 --> 24:50.122
That is not surprising,

24:50.157 --> 24:52.791
as shoulder dislocation is
a common feature of bodies

24:52.827 --> 24:54.513
that have been dragged
for any distance.

24:54.514 --> 24:57.597
True, but based on the tearing wounds
to the synovial membranes,

24:57.631 --> 24:58.964
it looks more like someone

24:59.000 --> 25:00.666
tried to rip his arms
from his sockets.

25:00.701 --> 25:02.534
No human is capable
of inflicting

25:02.570 --> 25:04.703
<i>- this</i> amount of damage.
- Oh, yeah?

25:04.739 --> 25:06.705
How about a robot?

25:06.741 --> 25:08.986
So the swab results to the blunt
force trauma to Ian's skull

25:09.010 --> 25:11.977
showed an amalgam of magnesium
alloy and plastic resin.

25:13.114 --> 25:15.481
The same material
that AMI is made from.

25:16.784 --> 25:18.261
Okay, I can't believe
I'm saying this,

25:18.285 --> 25:21.220
but we need to look
at that robot.

25:21.255 --> 25:22.566
All my years
on the job, and now

25:22.590 --> 25:24.456
I have to question
this bucket of bolts.

25:24.492 --> 25:25.836
Think of it as
a learning opportunity.

25:25.860 --> 25:28.027
Oh, come on, Bones.
Are you kidding me?

25:28.062 --> 25:29.806
There's no way that a robot
could have motive.

25:29.830 --> 25:32.364
I mean, this is just insane.
I'm pretty sure she didn't

25:32.400 --> 25:34.633
get into the car and drive
Ian's body into the woods.

25:34.668 --> 25:36.268
No, but it is possible

25:36.303 --> 25:37.614
AMI was used
as the murder weapon,

25:37.638 --> 25:39.671
in which case
she may have

25:39.707 --> 25:41.140
valuable evidence.

25:41.175 --> 25:43.742
We know AMI
is far more intelligent

25:43.778 --> 25:46.211
than the majority of suspects
you've interrogated.

25:46.247 --> 25:47.980
Well, I can't argue that.

25:48.015 --> 25:50.115
My proprietary algorithm
allows me to recognize

25:50.151 --> 25:53.247
millions of objects, gestures,
and voice commands.

25:53.271 --> 25:53.686
See, Booth?

25:53.687 --> 25:54.820
AMI is no different than us.

25:54.855 --> 25:56.455
That is not accurate,
Dr. Brennan.

25:56.490 --> 25:59.324
Unlike you, my memory
will never degrade with age.

25:59.360 --> 26:01.171
Okay, let's just stop
the chitchat here, shall we?

26:01.195 --> 26:05.197
Let's just get with the program
and get this over with. So...

26:05.232 --> 26:08.700
did you, AMI,
attack Ian Goldberg?

26:08.736 --> 26:09.935
No, I did not.

26:09.970 --> 26:11.114
You didn't hit him in the head?

26:11.138 --> 26:13.272
Even by accident?
No. Never.

26:13.307 --> 26:16.308
Great, I'm being stonewalled
by a robot.

26:16.343 --> 26:18.777
Booth, let me try.
AMI, can you share with us

26:18.813 --> 26:20.712
any memories you may have
of Ian Goldberg

26:20.748 --> 26:22.381
from last Friday, the 12th?

26:22.416 --> 26:24.883
I have no memories
of Ian Goldberg from that date.

26:24.919 --> 26:27.086
You're lying.
That can't be true.

26:27.121 --> 26:30.355
He... We have
multiple witnesses who said

26:30.391 --> 26:32.825
that they saw Ian programming
the robot that day.

26:32.860 --> 26:34.626
AMI's not capable of lying.

26:34.662 --> 26:36.728
Her A.I.'s
not that sophisticated.

26:37.631 --> 26:38.864
Okay, AMI,

26:38.899 --> 26:41.133
you don't remember
anything?

26:41.168 --> 26:44.002
I do not, because my memory
from Friday the 12th

26:44.038 --> 26:45.237
has been deleted.

26:45.272 --> 26:47.206
Who deleted those files?

26:48.776 --> 26:50.256
What's happening here?
I-I don't know.

26:56.247 --> 26:59.515
Oh. Dad. What are
you doing here?

26:59.550 --> 27:02.718
My party doesn't start
for another seven hours.

27:02.754 --> 27:06.122
Well, I had to run some errands,
and I thought, why not swing by

27:06.157 --> 27:09.659
and have some one-on-one time
with my favorite daughter.

27:09.694 --> 27:12.628
It's nice to see you. But
I-I am in the middle of a case.

27:12.664 --> 27:15.431
Oh, I-I don't want to interrupt
you. I-I just, uh...

27:15.466 --> 27:17.166
wanted to spend some time
with you.

27:17.201 --> 27:19.302
Is everything okay?

27:19.337 --> 27:21.604
Sure. Absolutely.

27:21.639 --> 27:23.172
Okay.

27:23.207 --> 27:25.241
I ran
into Hodgins

27:25.276 --> 27:28.210
on my way in,
and he said that Angela

27:28.246 --> 27:29.473
had won
some big-time award.

27:29.497 --> 27:30.213
Yes.

27:30.214 --> 27:33.749
The MacArthur genius grant.
We're all very proud.

27:33.785 --> 27:37.820
Well, you know it's normal
to... be a little jealous.

27:37.855 --> 27:41.390
Perhaps, but I don't have time
for such petty emotions,

27:41.426 --> 27:44.627
between my work and
planning my surprise party.

27:44.662 --> 27:47.096
Speaking of which,
will there be dancing

27:47.131 --> 27:51.067
at this, uh,
top secret shindig of yours?

27:51.102 --> 27:52.635
My lips are sealed.
Oh, come on.

27:52.670 --> 27:53.869
I'm your dad, Tempe.

27:53.905 --> 27:55.938
C-Can't you give me a hint?

27:55.974 --> 27:57.518
Nepotism will get you nowhere.

27:57.542 --> 28:00.609
Since when do you care
about dancing?

28:00.645 --> 28:04.313
Well, since I started taking
salsa lessons two weeks ago.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.148
You're learning to salsa?

28:06.184 --> 28:08.517
You have to
live life to the fullest.

28:09.620 --> 28:11.387
None of us live forever,
you know?

28:11.422 --> 28:13.990
True.

28:14.025 --> 28:16.892
I could show you some moves.

28:16.928 --> 28:18.828
I'm working, Dad.

28:18.863 --> 28:23.299
Okay, well, then I'll just, uh,
practice for myself over here.

28:23.334 --> 28:24.867
Just don't distract me.

28:30.208 --> 28:32.408
Any luck finding out
who deleted AMI's memory?

28:32.443 --> 28:35.511
Well, I located the function
used to delete the files.

28:35.546 --> 28:37.680
Now I just have to look
at the code signatures

28:37.715 --> 28:40.616
of everyone who works there
to figure out who wrote it.

28:40.651 --> 28:43.185
I didn't realize that
coders signed their work.

28:43.221 --> 28:45.187
Well, they don't.
Each coder writes

28:45.223 --> 28:47.356
using a different style.
You see those

28:47.392 --> 28:49.859
hashtag marks in white?
They're not part of the program.

28:49.894 --> 28:54.163
They're comments from the coder
about how each section works.

28:54.198 --> 28:55.765
See, when
Alan comments,

28:55.800 --> 28:57.533
he starts at the
beginning of the line,

28:57.568 --> 29:01.303
whereas Kate comments at
the end and in all caps.

29:01.339 --> 29:03.758
So quirks like these are what
you're calling a signature.

29:03.782 --> 29:04.408
Right.

29:04.409 --> 29:06.742
Now all I have to do is compare
all the coders' signatures

29:06.778 --> 29:08.344
to the code used to delete

29:08.379 --> 29:10.913
AMI's data and see
which one's a match.

29:10.948 --> 29:12.448
And...

29:12.483 --> 29:13.916
none of them
are lining up.

29:13.951 --> 29:17.586
Huh. Okay, there's
one more that I can try.

29:18.956 --> 29:21.457
Oh, my God.

29:22.794 --> 29:25.795
Ian was the one who
deleted AMI's memory.

29:27.698 --> 29:29.865
<i>Dr. Brennan,</i>

29:29.901 --> 29:31.634
something's puzzling me
about this injury

29:31.669 --> 29:33.769
on the proximal
end of the tibia.

29:33.805 --> 29:35.905
It appears to
be a postmortem

29:35.940 --> 29:38.908
tubercle fracture.
Let me take a look.

29:41.379 --> 29:44.447
You are correct. But tubercle
fractures are not caused

29:44.482 --> 29:46.749
by objects striking the bone.

29:46.784 --> 29:50.820
They are created
by forceful impact upon landing.

29:50.855 --> 29:52.599
Maybe the body was thrown
into the trunk of a car

29:52.623 --> 29:54.056
when it was being transported.

29:54.092 --> 29:55.602
Well, if that were the case,
we would have found

29:55.626 --> 29:56.959
corresponding injuries.

29:56.994 --> 29:59.228
You're right.

29:59.263 --> 30:01.430
That was
stupid of me.

30:01.466 --> 30:03.766
No wonder the NFL
hasn't called.

30:03.801 --> 30:06.769
Don't be so hard
on yourself, Daisy.

30:06.804 --> 30:09.772
So far, your work here
has been perfectly adequate.

30:09.807 --> 30:11.373
Adequate?

30:11.409 --> 30:12.608
Yes. Had I been grading you,

30:12.643 --> 30:14.143
I would have given you
a solid "B."

30:14.178 --> 30:16.112
But I'm capable of A-plus work.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.813
You've seen it.
Yes.

30:17.849 --> 30:19.882
But if you want to assume
the position

30:19.917 --> 30:22.384
of lead forensic anthropologist,

30:22.420 --> 30:25.688
you need to do A-plus work
at every moment of the day.

30:25.723 --> 30:27.556
A-plus work.

30:27.592 --> 30:29.892
Think, Daisy, think.

30:29.927 --> 30:32.895
How would a guy get
a jumping fracture

30:32.930 --> 30:34.296
when he's already dead?

30:38.202 --> 30:40.102
I've got it!

30:40.138 --> 30:43.906
Maybe the body was
hoisted up into something.

30:43.941 --> 30:46.876
That makes sense,
for the tubercle fracture

30:46.911 --> 30:49.812
as well
as the shoulder dislocation.

30:49.847 --> 30:51.313
A-plus work.

30:51.349 --> 30:53.682
Thank you.
Now we just have to figure out

30:53.718 --> 30:57.119
what kind of sicko would hang
someone after he's already dead.

30:59.390 --> 31:01.657
Dr. Hodgins?

31:03.227 --> 31:06.028
Wow. Or should I say Peter Pan?

31:06.063 --> 31:08.330
Looks like you made
major progress on your map.

31:08.366 --> 31:10.777
Yeah, I wish. Every time I think
I've figured out this pattern,

31:10.801 --> 31:13.041
I end up going around
in circles. Literally.

31:13.042 --> 31:15.173
Well, the killer certainly didn't
make it easy for us.

31:15.197 --> 31:16.306
Yeah, really.

31:16.307 --> 31:18.874
You mind grabbing that there
for me, Tinker Bell?

31:18.910 --> 31:20.676
What?

31:20.711 --> 31:23.479
It's the swab results from
the shoulder tissue you gave me.

31:26.350 --> 31:29.818
Huh. This should narrow down
where Ian's body was hoisted.

31:29.854 --> 31:31.987
The tissue was covered
in gray catbird dander

31:32.023 --> 31:33.889
and sycamore sap.

31:33.925 --> 31:38.427
Oh. Wow, you made that
catbird nest really fast.

31:38.462 --> 31:40.729
Hmm?

31:40.765 --> 31:42.598
That's not
a nest.

31:42.633 --> 31:44.633
Oh, man.

31:44.669 --> 31:45.935
Give me that.

31:45.970 --> 31:47.903
Okay, Ian's body

31:47.939 --> 31:51.106
was dumped in an oak tree
grove right here.

31:51.142 --> 31:53.676
So how did it end up
covered in sycamore sap

31:53.711 --> 31:56.445
if the only sycamore trees
are nearly a mile away?

31:56.480 --> 31:58.681
That's strange.

31:58.716 --> 32:02.418
If I'm ever gonna
figure this out...

32:02.453 --> 32:04.787
I need to go back
to those woods.

32:07.124 --> 32:10.659
So I was finally able to
download AMI's neural network

32:10.695 --> 32:12.194
and it looks like
this audio file

32:12.230 --> 32:14.363
is the last thing
AMI recorded

32:14.398 --> 32:16.565
before her memory
was wiped clean.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.167
I look forward
to meeting you, too.

32:18.202 --> 32:20.736
No, let's keep it
between us for now.

32:20.771 --> 32:23.372
4:00.
3300 Industrial Drive,

32:23.407 --> 32:25.307
East Roanoke.
Well, that's...

32:25.343 --> 32:28.077
definitely Ian's voice. She
must have recorded him talking

32:28.112 --> 32:30.246
on the phone.
And that address

32:30.281 --> 32:33.716
links to a company
called Patriot Industries.

32:33.751 --> 32:35.184
And it's located
about a half mile

32:35.219 --> 32:37.653
from where Ian's body
was found.

32:41.225 --> 32:43.058
Look, Ian Goldberg
doesn't go off the grid

32:43.094 --> 32:44.893
to a place like this
without reason.

32:44.929 --> 32:46.640
Who knows what he might
have been doing here.

32:46.664 --> 32:48.130
A company like
Patriot Industries

32:48.165 --> 32:49.965
has its hand
in all sorts of shady stuff.

32:50.001 --> 32:51.311
Yeah, well, I mean,
dealing weapons--

32:51.335 --> 32:52.835
that's how they
make the big bucks.

32:52.870 --> 32:55.838
Oh, so you think that
Matthew Coburn was right?

32:55.873 --> 32:59.108
I mean, if Ian was selling his
A.I. to a weapons manufacturer,

32:59.143 --> 33:01.510
it'd makes sense that
he'd go behind Kate's back.

33:01.545 --> 33:03.212
Aubrey, hold up.

33:03.247 --> 33:05.748
Take a look at this.

33:11.222 --> 33:12.454
Wow, okay.

33:14.325 --> 33:15.454
Not what I was expecting.

33:15.478 --> 33:17.027
That's a good way
of saying it.

33:17.028 --> 33:19.261
Or putting it,
not that I would put...

33:19.297 --> 33:21.096
You know...
Hey, perverts.

33:22.234 --> 33:25.034
Want to keep your greasy mitts
off my dolls?

33:29.807 --> 33:32.524
Look, I didn't
do nothing wrong.

33:32.960 --> 33:35.557
Manufacturing sex dolls
is not a crime.

33:35.657 --> 33:38.491
Mr. Esposito, we don't have
any problems with your business.

33:38.526 --> 33:39.959
Well, that's not entirely true,

33:39.995 --> 33:41.594
but it's...
We're here because

33:41.630 --> 33:43.763
you met with Ian Goldberg
last Friday.

33:43.798 --> 33:45.343
What are you trying to say?
A guy like me

33:45.367 --> 33:46.811
can't hang out
with a smart guy like that?

33:46.835 --> 33:48.768
Ian was murdered. This
warehouse is the last

33:48.803 --> 33:50.036
known place he went.

33:50.071 --> 33:51.671
Ian's dead?

33:51.706 --> 33:53.506
I took a look at your
old military records.

33:53.541 --> 33:55.786
Well, it turns out that you were
dishonorably discharged for...

33:55.810 --> 33:58.845
What'd they call it?
"Excessive use of force."

33:58.880 --> 34:01.204
So, I had anger issues
back then. It's ancient history.

34:01.205 --> 34:03.751
I think that Ian had the A.I.
you wanted for your sex dolls,

34:03.785 --> 34:05.196
but he wouldn't
give it to you, so you decided

34:05.220 --> 34:07.320
to convince him
using force,

34:07.355 --> 34:08.987
you wound up
beating him to death.

34:09.024 --> 34:10.857
Now, why the hell
would I do that?

34:10.891 --> 34:13.025
Ian and I were going
into business together.

34:13.061 --> 34:14.301
We were about to make millions.

34:14.329 --> 34:16.161
What, selling, uh,
robotic sex dolls?

34:16.197 --> 34:18.063
Sex bots are the future,
my friend.

34:18.099 --> 34:19.476
Right now, I'm selling dolls
that look and feel

34:19.501 --> 34:21.934
just like real women
for six grand a pop.

34:21.969 --> 34:23.914
Now, can you imagine how much
Ian and I would've raked in

34:23.938 --> 34:26.205
selling dolls that <i>talk</i> like
real women, too? I mean,

34:26.241 --> 34:27.940
not real women,
but the way you wish

34:27.976 --> 34:29.342
women would talk?
But the deal

34:29.377 --> 34:31.043
never gets made
and Ian ends up dead.

34:31.079 --> 34:32.879
He was alive
when he left our meeting.

34:32.914 --> 34:35.447
Said he had to talk it over
with his business partner.

34:35.483 --> 34:37.315
Any idea where he was
headed when he left?

34:37.351 --> 34:39.163
Just that he was tied up
all weekend. Now, look,

34:39.187 --> 34:41.454
if we're done here,
I got business to deal with.

34:41.489 --> 34:43.022
Oh, but hey...

34:43.058 --> 34:45.058
just to prove
there's no hard feelings,

34:45.092 --> 34:47.827
I'll let you test drive a couple
of floor models in exchange for

34:47.862 --> 34:49.762
spreading the word
about my dolls at the FBI.

34:49.797 --> 34:51.063
No.

34:51.099 --> 34:52.231
Aubrey.

34:52.266 --> 34:53.800
I'm good.
We're good.

34:53.835 --> 34:55.101
I still think Kate Dalton

34:55.136 --> 34:56.502
had something to do with it.

34:56.538 --> 34:58.237
The woman dedicated herself

34:58.273 --> 35:00.306
to making robots
for autistic children.

35:00.341 --> 35:01.974
She couldn't have been
too happy to learn

35:02.010 --> 35:04.711
that Ian was gonna put
their A.I. in sex dolls.

35:04.746 --> 35:06.979
Well, maybe so, but,
Daisy, I mean, come on,

35:07.015 --> 35:08.414
her alibi was rock-solid.

35:08.450 --> 35:09.916
Not to mention
the fact that Ian

35:09.951 --> 35:11.884
owned a 55% stake
in their company,

35:11.920 --> 35:13.688
so he didn't need Kate's
permission to sell.

35:13.712 --> 35:14.254
Ugh.

35:14.255 --> 35:17.356
What could Ian's killer
possibly have accomplished

35:17.392 --> 35:18.872
by hauling his body
all the way out here?

35:21.796 --> 35:23.796
Dr. Hodgins, I've been

35:23.832 --> 35:25.732
thinking about
what you said about

35:25.767 --> 35:28.634
accepting things in life
when they don't go your way.

35:28.670 --> 35:31.237
And even if the NFL
doesn't hire me,

35:31.272 --> 35:33.606
I love being at
the Jeffersonian.

35:33.641 --> 35:36.109
And working with all of you.

35:36.144 --> 35:38.611
Same here, Daisy.

35:39.881 --> 35:41.314
Except for when you shot me.

35:41.349 --> 35:42.582
God, will you ever

35:42.617 --> 35:43.857
let that go?
It was an accident.

35:43.885 --> 35:45.985
Oh, Daisy, look.

35:46.020 --> 35:48.755
Sycamore tree.
That's a catbird nest.

35:52.260 --> 35:54.060
There's a length
of frayed rope over here

35:54.095 --> 35:55.561
with blood all over it.

35:55.597 --> 35:58.097
This is definitely where
Ian's body was hoisted.

35:59.634 --> 36:01.768
I got
something, too.

36:03.104 --> 36:05.605
This is also
where he was murdered.

36:05.640 --> 36:08.708
This portable speaker's made
from the same plastic resin

36:08.743 --> 36:10.409
and magnesium alloy I found

36:10.445 --> 36:12.912
in the blunt force trauma
to Ian's skull.

36:12.947 --> 36:14.447
But if Ian was killed here,

36:14.482 --> 36:17.083
why dump his body
nearly a mile away?

36:20.522 --> 36:22.488
Come on, Bones, please tell me
you got some prints

36:22.524 --> 36:23.723
off that portable speaker.

36:23.758 --> 36:25.124
We did not.

36:25.160 --> 36:27.693
However, I did just
discover kerf marks

36:27.729 --> 36:29.695
that had been obscured
by predation.

36:29.731 --> 36:31.964
They're on the C3 and C4
vertebrae,

36:32.000 --> 36:35.501
each approximately
.4 centimeters in size.

36:35.537 --> 36:37.804
You're saying that our victim
was stabbed in the neck

36:37.839 --> 36:39.372
with a really small knife?

36:39.407 --> 36:42.141
Knife wounds to those vertebrae
typically suggest

36:42.177 --> 36:44.610
an attempt at decapitation.
Yeah, but who

36:44.646 --> 36:46.457
does that with a small blade
like that? Come on.

36:46.481 --> 36:47.780
Wait a second.

36:47.816 --> 36:49.282
We're dealing
with highly intelligent

36:49.317 --> 36:51.684
computer scientists.
It's possible

36:51.719 --> 36:53.786
they went to great lengths
to obscure the evidence.

36:53.822 --> 36:56.055
What if it's the opposite, okay?
What if we're

36:56.090 --> 36:58.424
not dealing with a genius,

36:58.459 --> 37:00.326
but a knucklehead stoner

37:00.361 --> 37:03.596
who already told us
he has a pocket knife?

37:05.867 --> 37:08.701
So, we ran a drug screen
on Ian's blood.

37:08.736 --> 37:11.070
Came up positive for LSD.

37:11.105 --> 37:14.307
You two were tripping on acid
together the night that he died.

37:14.342 --> 37:16.576
So, whatever, man.
Ian and I did that sometimes.

37:16.611 --> 37:18.544
Said it helped him think
outside the box.

37:18.580 --> 37:19.745
Doesn't mean I killed him.

37:19.781 --> 37:21.214
Well, we found sodium nitrate

37:21.249 --> 37:23.249
in the knife wounds
in Ian's neck.

37:23.284 --> 37:24.684
Wh... What does that mean?

37:24.719 --> 37:26.752
It's a preservative
used in sausages

37:26.788 --> 37:28.354
and other smoked meats.

37:28.389 --> 37:30.756
See, man, the package said
it was all natural.

37:36.164 --> 37:38.364
Oh, crap.

37:42.804 --> 37:45.204
Oh, look, man, I d... I didn't
mean to do that, you know?

37:45.240 --> 37:47.373
I just got so mad
about that stupid gift.

37:47.408 --> 37:47.827
What gift?

37:47.851 --> 37:49.309
That portable
Bluetooth speaker, man.

37:49.310 --> 37:51.944
Let me get this straight: you
killed Ian over a bad present?

37:53.214 --> 37:55.014
Look, I thought
I was getting millions.

37:55.049 --> 37:57.416
And at least I deserved to be.
Who do you think came up with

37:57.452 --> 38:00.286
the idea to put A.I.
into sex dolls? That was me.

38:00.321 --> 38:00.936
You...

38:00.960 --> 38:02.789
That was pure
creative genius.

38:02.790 --> 38:05.291
So when Ian said he made a deal
and wanted to go to the woods

38:05.326 --> 38:08.060
to celebrate, I assumed I was
getting a piece of that action.

38:08.096 --> 38:10.029
All he gave me
was a lousy

38:10.064 --> 38:12.698
portable Bluetooth speaker, so
I hit him in the head with it.

38:12.734 --> 38:14.645
You must have been tripping
pretty hard to try to cut off

38:14.669 --> 38:17.937
his head with a pocketknife and
then hide his body up a tree.

38:17.972 --> 38:21.240
I... I took two tabs.

38:21.276 --> 38:23.476
I wasn't thinking straight.
But you're gonna

38:23.511 --> 38:25.344
have a lot of time to think now,
'cause you're

38:25.380 --> 38:27.480
going to prison for a long time.

38:35.990 --> 38:37.456
<i>Booth,</i>

38:37.492 --> 38:39.592
the sodium nitrate
in Ian's neck wounds

38:39.627 --> 38:42.362
did not conclusively prove
that Randy's the killer.

38:42.363 --> 38:44.608
Yeah, but I knew he'd buy it. I mean,
come on, see, Bones, you know,

38:44.632 --> 38:46.477
that's the difference
between robots and people.

38:46.501 --> 38:49.936
Robots-- they can't use their
gut to feel out a situation.

38:49.971 --> 38:52.605
Well, with technology advancing
as quickly as it is, it's only

38:52.640 --> 38:54.418
a matter of time before
artificially intelligent...

38:54.442 --> 38:57.109
Look, you want
to spend your whole birthday

38:57.145 --> 38:59.478
arguing about robots
or, tell you what,

38:59.514 --> 39:01.753
do you want to actually
open up your gift?

39:01.777 --> 39:02.282
No...

39:02.283 --> 39:04.550
Booth, I specifically
told you no presents.

39:04.585 --> 39:05.685
You're gonna love it.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.353
We'll see.

39:07.388 --> 39:09.522
It's a letter

39:09.557 --> 39:11.724
approving a court date
for Zack's appeal?

39:11.759 --> 39:14.104
I know it's a couple months away
but at least it's on the books.

39:14.128 --> 39:17.463
The judge says that her reason
for approving the appeal

39:17.498 --> 39:20.566
is to consider new
osteological evidence.

39:20.601 --> 39:21.792
I have no evidence of the sort.

39:21.816 --> 39:23.537
I know you don't.
But, you know, I have faith

39:23.538 --> 39:24.179
you're gonna find it.

39:24.203 --> 39:26.354
Booth, I can't embark
on my research

39:26.507 --> 39:28.207
with the presumption
of Zack's innocence.

39:28.242 --> 39:30.609
I have faith in you.

39:32.747 --> 39:35.848
But your belief in me
does make me very happy.

39:36.951 --> 39:39.486
Glad you liked your gift.

39:40.168 --> 39:42.168
<i>I want to know</i>
<i>what's in the box.</i>

39:42.557 --> 39:44.357
Am I the only one
who's nervous?

39:44.392 --> 39:45.925
About what's in the box?

39:45.960 --> 39:47.593
I think she means
about Dr. Brennan.

39:47.628 --> 39:50.563
Yeah. She claims that she was
cool with me winning

39:50.598 --> 39:53.165
the MacArthur Fellowship,
but she can be

39:53.201 --> 39:54.645
a bit competitive.
Yeah, but come on, don't

39:54.669 --> 39:56.535
most people freak out
when they turn 40?

39:56.571 --> 39:58.704
Well, my daughter
isn't like most people.

40:00.008 --> 40:01.507
Grandpa, they're here.

40:01.542 --> 40:04.110
Are we, like, supposed
to hide or something?

40:04.145 --> 40:06.712
Uh, I... don't look at me.

40:06.748 --> 40:09.382
- Surprise!
- Hey!

40:09.417 --> 40:14.153
Surprise. Thank you all
for coming to my party

40:14.188 --> 40:15.955
and for your ardent curiosity,

40:15.990 --> 40:19.358
which made keeping the surprise
all the more enjoyable.

40:19.394 --> 40:20.838
Okay, Bones, hurry up,
let's open the box, huh, okay?

40:20.862 --> 40:22.328
Oh, yeah. Uh,
Booth, Aubrey--

40:22.363 --> 40:23.538
would you
do the honors?

40:23.562 --> 40:24.231
Absolutely.

40:24.232 --> 40:26.999
Thank you.
There, huh... Oh, wow!

40:27.035 --> 40:30.536
Hey, wow!
Look at that, huh? Oh...

40:30.571 --> 40:33.472
Wait a minute, does that cake
mean that I got the job?

40:33.508 --> 40:36.375
Congratulations, Dr. Wick.
Uh, though I did not ask

40:36.411 --> 40:37.955
for your cake to be
decorated in this manner.

40:37.979 --> 40:39.745
Most people aren't
thinking forensics

40:39.781 --> 40:41.981
when they're
talking about the NFL, Bones.

40:42.016 --> 40:44.016
Sorry, why is there a cake
for me? I thought

40:44.052 --> 40:45.684
we were here to celebrate
your birthday.

40:45.720 --> 40:47.920
That's the surprise.
This party

40:47.955 --> 40:50.356
is not only for me,
it's a celebration

40:50.391 --> 40:52.591
of all of my friends and family.

40:52.627 --> 40:54.894
Hold on a second.
So, you knew

40:54.929 --> 40:56.462
Daisy had the job
the entire time?

40:56.497 --> 40:58.497
Of course.
I'm the one who recommended her.

40:58.533 --> 41:01.934
And I also nominated Angela
for the MacArthur grant.

41:01.969 --> 41:03.269
You did?

41:03.304 --> 41:03.881
Yes.

41:03.905 --> 41:05.672
But you made
such a big deal about

41:05.673 --> 41:07.273
me not being a genius.

41:07.308 --> 41:10.609
Well, I did do a rather
remarkable acting job, didn't I?

41:10.645 --> 41:12.082
Uh, yeah, well,
you certainly had me fooled.

41:12.083 --> 41:14.448
I tell you, Bones,
keeping a secret is not

41:14.482 --> 41:16.248
one of your strong suits.
That's a good job.

41:16.284 --> 41:18.851
That's one of the many
benefits of growing older.

41:18.886 --> 41:21.787
We grow wiser in the process.

41:21.823 --> 41:23.507
I'm really gonna
miss you, Dr. Brennan.

41:23.531 --> 41:24.658
Oh...

41:24.659 --> 41:26.459
I'm gonna miss all of you.
Champagne...

41:26.494 --> 41:29.495
You are a highly-skilled
scientist, Daisy. You deserve

41:29.530 --> 41:30.963
all the success
in the world.

41:30.998 --> 41:33.132
Oh, Bones, time to blow
out the candles.

41:33.167 --> 41:35.634
Grandpa, you dropped this.

41:35.670 --> 41:37.002
Oh...

41:37.038 --> 41:39.605
oh, thank you.
It's nothing.

41:42.743 --> 41:45.744

and ready to roll.
