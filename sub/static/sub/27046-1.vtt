01:26.030 --> 01:28.030
The Goddess of Prosperity ...

01:29.530 --> 01:32.280
is the symbol of
unlimited gold and food

01:34.320 --> 01:38.110
And this earth is her womb

01:39.610 --> 01:41.070
When the universe was created...

01:42.110 --> 01:45.400
she gave birth
to 160 million Gods

01:46.490 --> 01:49.570
But the Goddess loved
her first child above all ...

01:50.530 --> 01:51.950
Hastar

01:53.530 --> 01:57.740
But today, you won't find his
name in any ancient scriptures

01:58.280 --> 01:59.150
Why, father?

02:00.320 --> 02:03.200
Because he wanted all of
the Goddess' gold and food

02:05.400 --> 02:07.740
He managed getting the gold ...

02:08.240 --> 02:09.990
but just as he went
for the food ...

02:10.449 --> 02:12.740
all the other
Gods attacked him

02:14.320 --> 02:16.990
With every blow, Hastar
shattered into fragments

02:18.150 --> 02:21.200
But before he could
dissolve into stardust,

02:21.990 --> 02:23.570
The Goddess saved him

02:25.070 --> 02:26.700
But on one condition

02:27.780 --> 02:32.240
That he will never be worshiped
and be forgotten for ever

02:33.860 --> 02:38.070
For aeons, Hastar
slept in his mother's womb

02:39.240 --> 02:41.950
But one day, our
ancestors invoked him

02:42.490 --> 02:44.900
And built a shrine in his name

02:46.740 --> 02:48.820
They say, since that day,
all the Gods' wrath ...

02:49.360 --> 02:51.110
has been raining on Tumbbad

02:51.780 --> 02:53.400
Why did we even wake him up?

02:54.780 --> 02:57.950
Because Hastar's curse
is a boon for us

02:58.950 --> 02:59.900
What do you mean?

03:00.530 --> 03:01.700
You'll know ...

03:02.900 --> 03:03.950
when you go inside

03:04.360 --> 03:05.780
Inside where?

03:07.570 --> 03:09.150
In the Goddess' womb

04:29.820 --> 04:31.320
Please, hurry up

04:31.650 --> 04:33.280
It's about to get dark

04:33.570 --> 04:36.530
It'll take the time it takes

04:37.360 --> 04:40.570
I am terrified of not feeding
that old hag on time

04:41.360 --> 04:42.200
What if she wakes up?

04:42.360 --> 04:44.110
Don't say such things
at this dark hour

04:44.490 --> 04:45.650
She won't wake up

04:45.950 --> 04:48.570
If you want to leave in time,
then come early

04:57.740 --> 05:02.030
You'd promised me that
gold coin, after this new moon

05:03.530 --> 05:07.950
The coin is not a joke!
One has to earn it

05:36.780 --> 05:39.860
-Where's mother?
-Wait here

05:41.280 --> 05:42.900
Where is she?

05:44.360 --> 05:47.070
Where else, must be
at Sarkar's mansion

06:01.610 --> 06:03.990
Who will feed the old woman?

06:04.900 --> 06:06.780
Mother will, once she returns

06:07.570 --> 06:09.570
-What if she's late?
-Shut up!

06:12.150 --> 06:14.030
What if the old woman
wakes up?

07:14.490 --> 07:16.990
She eats while
she's asleep?

07:17.570 --> 07:20.570
You put it in her mouth,
bit by bit, she swallows

07:22.320 --> 07:23.900
Does she ever wake up?

07:24.820 --> 07:25.570
No

07:25.900 --> 07:28.650
Have you ever fed her before?

07:29.990 --> 07:30.990
No

07:51.700 --> 07:53.070
What's this?

07:53.530 --> 07:55.900
I cooked, so
you go feed her

08:02.030 --> 08:04.110
Go on.
Else she'll wake up

08:04.200 --> 08:06.280
Go, don't be afraid

08:06.740 --> 08:08.280
I say, go on!

08:32.110 --> 08:33.700
Sadashiv!

08:59.900 --> 09:02.240
<Chanting>

10:10.360 --> 10:12.150
Did he give you the gold coin?

10:13.070 --> 10:14.780
It didn't come up

10:15.530 --> 10:17.820
That bastard will never bring it up

10:20.200 --> 10:22.030
You dare to swear at your father?

10:25.820 --> 10:26.740
Tell him ...

10:26.950 --> 10:30.200
We won't look after his old hag
unless he gives us the coin

10:30.570 --> 10:32.900
No one else in the village
would dare to go close to her

10:34.650 --> 10:36.490
The gold coin is not a joke

10:36.780 --> 10:38.400
One has to earn it

10:38.700 --> 10:40.990
Being his mistress for 12 years
hasn't earned it?

10:57.780 --> 10:58.700
Mother!

11:15.610 --> 11:17.990
Let me go

11:21.740 --> 11:24.150
I don't want it

11:24.700 --> 11:27.110
I don't want the treasure

11:41.280 --> 11:43.650
Let me go

11:45.110 --> 11:46.820
Come in

11:50.320 --> 11:53.950
Sleep, else Hastar will come for you

14:04.360 --> 14:05.070
Mother?

14:05.860 --> 14:07.320
Sarkar is dead

14:08.070 --> 14:08.990
I know

14:11.950 --> 14:14.650
After dinner,
we'll start packing

14:16.650 --> 14:18.450
We are leaving Tumbbad

14:19.360 --> 14:21.280
-There is nothing left for us here.
-Why?

14:21.820 --> 14:24.450
Don't we inherit the mansion now?
There's no one else

14:24.650 --> 14:26.450
And starve to death
in that ruin?

14:26.650 --> 14:28.610
It isn't worth a penny

14:29.200 --> 14:31.530
For the village, we are
as good as outcastes

14:31.990 --> 14:34.570
And the mansion's hidden treasure.
Isn't that ours now?

14:36.360 --> 14:39.110
Sarkar searched all his life
but found nothing

14:40.030 --> 14:41.740
Squandered all his ancestral wealth as well

14:44.400 --> 14:45.740
What about the old woman?

14:45.950 --> 14:48.490
Why should we care now. Let her rot

14:50.990 --> 14:52.280
Shall we wake her up?

14:53.650 --> 14:55.490
She's Sarkar's great grandmother

14:56.400 --> 14:59.610
I'm sure she knows something
about the hidden treasure

14:59.990 --> 15:00.820
Go!

15:03.320 --> 15:04.150
Go ahead

15:05.150 --> 15:06.320
Wake her up and ask

15:11.240 --> 15:13.110
We leave at dawn, tomorrow

15:14.780 --> 15:16.570
And head to 'Pune'

15:32.400 --> 15:34.780
Even mentioning the treasure
brings ill fortune

15:35.200 --> 15:36.530
So, I didn't

15:44.070 --> 15:45.280
What is 'Pune'?

15:47.700 --> 15:49.150
It's a very big city

15:49.650 --> 15:53.360
Where carts move on their own,
without horses or bulls

15:53.610 --> 15:56.320
I don't believe anything
you say, nowadays

15:58.950 --> 15:59.700
Fine.

16:07.740 --> 16:08.950
Sadashiv!

16:23.150 --> 16:24.990
Mother!

16:33.610 --> 16:35.650
Sadashiv, don't sleep.

16:38.360 --> 16:40.610
I'll be back home by morning

16:42.450 --> 16:44.110
What about the old woman's food?

16:44.610 --> 16:47.400
-You'll have to feed her tonight.
-What if she wakes up?

16:47.820 --> 16:49.110
If she wakes up, say ...

16:49.240 --> 16:50.860
"Sleep, 'Hastar' will come for you."

16:50.990 --> 16:53.070
Who is 'Hastar'?

16:53.650 --> 16:56.320
Hurry up. Let's go!

16:57.820 --> 16:59.450
-Mother?
-You go!

17:01.030 --> 17:01.860
Go!

17:03.950 --> 17:08.359
Sadashiv, I am here.
Everything will be alright, son

18:01.490 --> 18:02.700
Sister?

18:03.650 --> 18:05.700
Do you still want to go
to the doctor?

18:06.400 --> 18:08.200
Or should I take us
to the graveyard?

18:10.990 --> 18:12.610
Take me to the mansion

19:47.950 --> 19:53.820
Who is this little prince?

19:54.700 --> 19:56.320
Come here, my child!

19:58.700 --> 19:59.780
<Chanting>

20:00.030 --> 20:02.530
Open the door, my child

20:07.400 --> 20:11.900
I am so hungry...
I need to eat something

20:14.280 --> 20:16.360
Treasure!

20:18.240 --> 20:20.150
Do you want it?

20:26.740 --> 20:29.700
Treasure!

20:33.490 --> 20:35.030
Come.

20:36.030 --> 20:37.490
Come now.

20:38.150 --> 20:39.400
Open it.

20:48.490 --> 20:50.820
Put that light away, moron

20:50.990 --> 20:53.780
Have you no brains?
It's hurting me

20:53.900 --> 20:55.360
Grandmother ...

20:56.570 --> 20:57.860
Son ...

20:58.240 --> 20:59.400
Grandmother ...

20:59.530 --> 21:01.280
Sorry, my boy.
Seeing light after a long time

21:01.820 --> 21:04.490
Ah, butterfly ... another one ...

21:05.700 --> 21:06.450
come here, my love

21:06.450 --> 21:07.740
Where's the treasure?

21:08.740 --> 21:12.070
-Grandmother?
-Look how they treat your grandma

21:12.070 --> 21:14.650
Locked my jaw with sharp nails

21:16.530 --> 21:19.820
Please put some food in this tube

21:20.030 --> 21:21.700
Is it in the mansion?

21:27.400 --> 21:29.030
Is it in the mansion?

21:30.740 --> 21:32.610
I am hungry

21:37.150 --> 21:41.530
Feed me and I'll
tell you everything

21:46.780 --> 21:50.400
Or should I just eat you?

22:08.240 --> 22:09.740
Sleep or else ...

22:12.490 --> 22:13.700
What was it?

22:16.110 --> 22:17.240
Sleep or else ...

22:17.530 --> 22:18.820
'Hiran' will come.

22:19.070 --> 22:20.990
Sleep or else ... Magar will come ...

22:21.110 --> 22:22.650
Sleep or else ... Hachkar will come ...

22:22.820 --> 22:25.360
'Sleep or else ... Haathi will come'

22:25.780 --> 22:26.400
Sleep or else ...

22:30.400 --> 22:33.110
'Sleep or else, Haathi will come ... Hiran ...'

22:33.740 --> 22:35.110
Sleep or else ...

22:45.820 --> 22:48.280
You forgot 'His' name, huh?

22:53.860 --> 22:54.360
Mother!

22:54.860 --> 22:56.200
I'll sing you a lullaby

22:57.990 --> 22:58.820
Let me go!

22:59.150 --> 23:01.740
Tonight I'll taste your flesh

23:03.610 --> 23:04.900
Brat! Don't act smart

23:04.900 --> 23:06.030
Grandmother, sleep or else ...

23:16.360 --> 23:17.200
Go to sleep ...

23:33.700 --> 23:35.070
Sleep or else 'Habbad' will come

23:51.360 --> 23:53.610
HASTAR!

23:57.900 --> 24:00.860
Grandmother, sleep or 'Hastar' will come for you!

24:52.450 --> 24:55.360
Vinayak! Open the door

25:08.820 --> 25:09.650
Mother ...

25:15.110 --> 25:16.650
Mother ...

25:17.030 --> 25:18.360
where is Sadashiv?

25:44.110 --> 25:46.320
There's still time.
Let's go back

25:46.400 --> 25:49.110
We'll tie her up and
get it out of her

25:49.200 --> 25:51.570
We won't feed her
till she tells us

25:51.650 --> 25:52.740
I know how to handle her now.

25:52.740 --> 25:55.070
-Let's go back, mother.
-Shut up!

25:57.280 --> 25:58.400
You little rascal ...

26:01.740 --> 26:03.200
This is all you care for, right?

26:04.110 --> 26:06.610
Keep it and shut your gob

26:15.490 --> 26:17.030
It's just a single coin

26:17.110 --> 26:21.820
Let's turn the boat around

26:21.900 --> 26:26.280
We'll torture her
till she tells us, okay?

26:26.360 --> 26:28.820
Keep quiet!

26:29.200 --> 26:32.320
You're just like that serpent,
your father

26:32.400 --> 26:36.650
I'll kill you,
if you ever return to Tumbbad

26:36.740 --> 26:37.570
Understood?

26:37.740 --> 26:39.950
Say it. Say you'll never
come back to Tumbbad!

26:40.030 --> 26:40.950
Mother!

26:41.570 --> 26:42.780
I'll throw it!

26:43.610 --> 26:44.740
Do it!

26:45.280 --> 26:47.700
-I'll do it!
-Go ahead!

26:50.200 --> 26:52.740
You don't have the balls to do it

26:53.110 --> 26:54.820
You're a greedy bastard

26:56.240 --> 26:59.860
I will kill you! Swear you'll never return to Tumbbad

27:00.240 --> 27:00.950
Swear on me!

27:01.150 --> 27:02.990
I will kill you! Swear you'll
never return to Tumbbad

27:03.070 --> 27:04.530
Or else I'll kill you right here!

27:04.740 --> 27:08.070
I wish you had died
instead of your little brother

27:08.200 --> 27:10.360
Have you lost your mind?

27:10.740 --> 27:11.820
I will throw you in the river

27:12.030 --> 27:15.490
Swear you'll
never return to Tumbbad

27:15.570 --> 27:17.070
Are you crazy?

27:17.150 --> 27:20.610
Swear!

27:20.700 --> 27:21.610
Quiet!

27:25.900 --> 27:27.110
Calm down!

27:27.610 --> 27:29.490
I'll never come back
to Tumbbad!

31:12.030 --> 31:12.990
Grandmother ...

31:15.110 --> 31:16.070
Grandmother ...

31:22.740 --> 31:24.150
My child ...

31:25.030 --> 31:27.150
You came back!

31:43.200 --> 31:48.240
Grandma, a tree grew out of you!

31:54.610 --> 31:56.700
Why didn't they banish you,
after your husband's death?

31:56.700 --> 32:00.650
Because they needed me

32:00.740 --> 32:04.650
I was the fastest
climbing down the well

32:04.950 --> 32:07.320
-Is treasure in the well?
-Don't go there!

32:07.570 --> 32:10.110
Save yourself from this curse

32:10.860 --> 32:13.780
The last time it ended with
me turning into a monster

32:13.780 --> 32:17.150
Don't start the cycle
of destruction again

32:17.320 --> 32:19.320
I won't go there, grandma

32:19.610 --> 32:21.990
Don't try to fool me.
You're my blood

32:22.490 --> 32:23.320
Bastard!

32:23.610 --> 32:26.200
Tell me where it is
and I'll give you half of it

32:26.740 --> 32:28.280
I don't want the treasure

32:28.610 --> 32:30.320
Then, what do you want?

32:30.780 --> 32:33.900
Freedom!

32:35.900 --> 32:37.400
Give me that fire

32:38.530 --> 32:45.030
You can't end my eternal hunger
but you can make this pain go away

32:46.150 --> 32:49.070
I've waited too long, my child.
I can't take it anymore

32:51.320 --> 32:58.990
Entering those gates is your choice,
after that nothing else will be

33:00.820 --> 33:06.570
Not everything you inherit
should be claimed, son

33:06.900 --> 33:09.360
If I won't,
someone will

33:10.070 --> 33:12.070
You're a greedy bastard!

33:12.490 --> 33:14.280
It's my only quality

34:49.989 --> 34:52.489
Are you sure you want this?

34:52.489 --> 34:54.400
Just do it, my child

34:54.610 --> 34:55.900
Do it, now!

35:40.860 --> 35:43.650
'We sell freshly ground wheat'

35:44.740 --> 35:46.280
Who is he?

35:46.530 --> 35:49.030
Hey! What do you want?

35:49.530 --> 35:51.990
Who are you?
Who is this man?

35:52.070 --> 35:53.820
I don't know.
Let me call father

35:54.150 --> 35:54.610
Thief!

35:55.570 --> 35:57.610
Thief! Thief!

35:57.700 --> 35:59.070
Shut up!

36:03.240 --> 36:04.530
It's Vinayak Rao

36:05.740 --> 36:08.070
Her husband.
Looks like a beggar now

36:13.610 --> 36:16.240
Where were you?

36:18.030 --> 36:19.780
I had no money left ...

36:21.150 --> 36:22.360
people were saying all
kinds of things ...

36:23.030 --> 36:25.070
So I started this business to survive ...

36:25.860 --> 36:27.990
You want to be an
independent woman now?

36:28.070 --> 36:29.320
You want to be free?

36:29.820 --> 36:30.650
Sorry, my mistake

36:30.740 --> 36:32.490
-I shouldn't have ...
-Come here!

36:32.780 --> 36:33.780
No, please...

36:38.150 --> 36:39.490
You want tp grind
flour, don't you?

36:39.490 --> 36:40.780
Grind it for me from now ...

36:41.150 --> 36:43.320
and see how
I'll make you a queen

36:43.320 --> 36:44.400
Let me go

36:45.240 --> 36:46.570
Let me go!

36:47.610 --> 36:50.780
-It will tear.
-I'll get you more, madame

36:50.780 --> 36:52.150
Where were you for
so many days?

36:55.280 --> 36:57.070
Wait! Neighbors will hear us

36:57.820 --> 36:58.950
Let me shut the door

37:13.280 --> 37:16.900
Ring the bell only once.
I'm not deaf

37:23.490 --> 37:25.780
I've been saving money
for an opium permit

37:25.990 --> 37:27.820
Been in talks with an officer too

37:28.360 --> 37:30.400
Once I am rich ...

37:31.150 --> 37:32.610
I'll need a clever assistant like you

37:32.740 --> 37:35.360
Hope you don't charge for compliments

37:35.700 --> 37:38.950
Your overdue interest is now
higher than the principal

37:40.360 --> 37:41.450
How will you repay me?

37:41.740 --> 37:44.200
Work 3 months for me,
we'll be even

37:46.150 --> 37:48.700
I have a gold coin.
Want to buy it?

37:52.110 --> 37:53.280
Let me see

38:02.740 --> 38:03.990
Where did you find it?

38:04.280 --> 38:05.570
Why do you care?

38:07.030 --> 38:08.860
I'd like to know if it is stolen

38:09.150 --> 38:11.150
I'd tell you if it were

38:11.990 --> 38:13.320
It's ancestral

38:13.780 --> 38:15.950
Times have gone so bad, huh?

38:20.450 --> 38:23.030
It costs 100 rupees.
I owe you 38 rupees

38:23.610 --> 38:25.650
-That leaves 62 rupees.
-Yes, right

38:28.780 --> 38:30.490
I have three more.
Interested?

38:47.240 --> 38:52.740
Each particle shines, with a sheen of gold ...
every ear listens

38:55.280 --> 39:00.780
To this splendid song, to this tune of wealth ...
I searched the entire earth

39:01.700 --> 39:03.400
Are you from Tumbbad?

39:06.070 --> 39:08.700
They say there's a treasure
hidden in Sarkar's mansion

39:08.780 --> 39:10.030
Is it true or just a rumour?

39:10.070 --> 39:11.320
It's true

39:13.150 --> 39:13.990
Go

39:14.150 --> 39:15.110
Loot it!

39:19.240 --> 39:24.740
To this splendid song, to this tune of wealth ...
I searched the entire earth

39:26.530 --> 39:33.820
Come, come conquer Tumbbad.

39:35.650 --> 39:36.900
Just two?

39:37.360 --> 39:39.490
Can't you get all
the coins together?

39:43.200 --> 39:48.700
The clouds erupt, yet my soul
Burns like an ember

39:48.860 --> 39:49.820
16?

39:51.150 --> 39:53.240
I don't have enough cash for this

39:53.700 --> 39:55.450
Now you owe me money

39:55.780 --> 39:58.320
Hope you aren't killing
anyone for these

40:16.110 --> 40:17.700
Consignment for Rajaji?

40:18.570 --> 40:19.950
Gift for my girlfriend

40:20.490 --> 40:22.070
Never known you to be so generous

40:22.650 --> 40:23.860
Hey Raghav!

40:25.240 --> 40:27.530
-Does he work for you?
-Who?

40:29.280 --> 40:32.320
That little bird who's been at
your house these past weeks

40:32.860 --> 40:35.820
Oh! He doesn't work for anyone

40:35.900 --> 40:37.070
He is his own master

40:37.280 --> 40:38.650
Raghav!

40:40.240 --> 40:41.400
Who is he?

40:42.570 --> 40:45.030
A man of small stature.
He is a nobody

40:45.450 --> 40:48.240
You better hurry up with
whatever you're planning to do

40:50.240 --> 40:53.490
That opium permit is yours for
the taking, but only for now

40:53.860 --> 40:55.320
It won't remain that way forever

40:56.450 --> 40:58.610
But my days are going
to change soon

40:58.820 --> 41:00.030
Listen

41:00.860 --> 41:02.450
I am getting promoted in a month

41:02.740 --> 41:04.450
I'm getting out of this Jungle Book

41:05.650 --> 41:09.240
There won't be anyone to link you
with Superintendent Sahib then

41:10.150 --> 41:12.320
You have one month!

41:26.240 --> 41:27.700
And I got angry ...

41:28.150 --> 41:30.280
I wished
mother would just die

41:31.110 --> 41:31.950
Then it so happened ...

41:32.150 --> 41:34.030
mother died the very next day

41:34.820 --> 41:37.450
I even had a brother
who died young

41:37.740 --> 41:42.280
I felt anyone who ill-treated me,
would just die

41:43.820 --> 41:46.450
I mean, that's what I used to think

41:47.110 --> 41:50.490
Where is Vinayak Rao
getting these coins from?

41:52.360 --> 41:53.030
I don't know

41:53.110 --> 41:54.400
-You don't know?
- No.

41:55.110 --> 41:59.400
Don't ever feel I wish badly upon you.
Or I too will ...

42:00.150 --> 42:01.950
No, no! That was just
a childish thought

42:02.280 --> 42:04.110
Right, no?

42:07.150 --> 42:08.780
Namaste Vinayak Rao

42:09.610 --> 42:11.280
Weren't you supposed to
come tomorrow?

42:11.650 --> 42:15.530
Yes ... no, I was just passing by

42:16.030 --> 42:18.030
So I thought ...

42:18.320 --> 42:22.740
Your consignment arrived.
So I thought I should get it

42:24.150 --> 42:25.200
Very good!

42:25.490 --> 42:26.650
It's like magic!

42:28.360 --> 42:30.110
How did you hurt your leg?

42:30.280 --> 42:31.110
I fell down ...

42:31.320 --> 42:34.110
-Whom were you running from?
-Play an Indian song

42:34.490 --> 42:36.650
Oh! We'll need another
record for that

42:36.860 --> 42:37.900
Another record?

42:38.320 --> 42:40.900
-So this is of no use?
-No, that's not the case

42:41.450 --> 42:42.780
All of this is good

42:42.950 --> 42:44.780
This is what you call a record

42:47.740 --> 42:48.900
Oh, okay

42:49.200 --> 42:52.650
The injury looks bad. Hope your
husband is not a freedom fighter

42:52.950 --> 42:55.200
No, but I am

42:56.450 --> 42:59.610
Our neighbour took me to the
civil disobedience march

42:59.780 --> 43:02.240
She asked me to bring
all our English goods

43:02.530 --> 43:05.740
I took just that old English doll,
to throw in the bonfire

43:06.700 --> 43:09.110
Excellent!
It was only for 10 rupees

43:11.320 --> 43:14.150
-May I say something?
-Sure

43:14.320 --> 43:16.030
You should buy yourself a motorbike

43:16.450 --> 43:20.110
Travelling in buses
doesn't suit you anymore

43:20.450 --> 43:23.610
-There's one motorcycle ...
-Come now, let's go

43:23.990 --> 43:28.070
Yes, let's go.
You must be tired

43:31.900 --> 43:36.490
-I'll take your leave, dear.
-Yes, but visit again

43:36.740 --> 43:39.490
It's like my own house,
why wouldn't I come?

43:40.200 --> 43:41.360
Of course.

43:41.650 --> 43:42.860
Your tea

43:44.570 --> 43:45.990
Go inside

43:50.070 --> 43:54.900
Say, why don't you make me
your business partner?

43:55.240 --> 43:58.950
Half the risk,
Double the profit

43:59.070 --> 44:01.360
Why do you want any risk at all?

44:01.570 --> 44:03.740
-You already have a good business.
-No...

44:04.110 --> 44:06.150
I just worry about you

44:06.490 --> 44:08.900
You deal in so much money

44:09.700 --> 44:11.490
Do you even keep accounts?

44:12.860 --> 44:16.150
You keep your accounts,
I'll keep my courage!

44:19.700 --> 44:20.610
Okay?

44:21.360 --> 44:22.320
Okay

44:25.780 --> 44:27.780
Raghav ji, listen ...

44:30.360 --> 44:33.280
If you ever need anything,
please don't hesitate ...

44:33.950 --> 44:36.740
Even if you need money.
I won't charge interest

44:38.030 --> 44:39.820
You look worried today

44:40.450 --> 44:41.740
No, it's nothing.
- Huh?

44:42.240 --> 44:43.400
It's nothing

44:44.400 --> 44:45.280
Is everything okay?

44:45.360 --> 44:46.490
Yes

44:46.950 --> 44:48.950
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye

45:03.780 --> 45:07.530
This madman roamed around like a fool

45:07.860 --> 45:11.450
Fighting for days, he fell into a dark night

45:11.780 --> 45:15.360
Wrote his own unwritten destiny

45:15.820 --> 45:18.570
Once unstoppable, his mind trapped in luxury

45:19.030 --> 45:20.860
You look like royalty.

45:21.320 --> 45:23.400
The darkness was in the past

45:23.820 --> 45:27.400
A bright future beckoned

45:27.820 --> 45:31.400
My ambition shined through

45:31.860 --> 45:35.450
It purified my soul

45:35.820 --> 45:41.150
I wandered destitute,
extracted gold from dust

45:43.110 --> 45:44.950
Hey Raghav!

45:46.450 --> 45:48.280
I've reduced my cut to 2000

45:49.900 --> 45:51.610
My promotion came through

45:52.990 --> 45:54.700
This is your last
chance to be rich

46:08.030 --> 46:09.240
Hey Raghav!

46:09.650 --> 46:11.150
Cooper Sahib!

46:15.150 --> 46:16.780
Hey... move fast!

46:17.070 --> 46:18.240
Who is she?

46:19.200 --> 46:20.240
Daughter-in-law!

46:27.200 --> 46:28.700
Two days ...

46:34.860 --> 46:36.780
I owed you 803 rupees ...

46:39.030 --> 46:40.860
I got her for 800

46:42.610 --> 46:43.280
800?

46:43.450 --> 46:44.820
Is it too much
or too less?

46:45.240 --> 46:46.200
Too much, of course

46:46.450 --> 46:48.030
She was to be burned
on her husband's pyre

46:48.280 --> 46:49.860
Had to pay them well

46:50.990 --> 46:52.900
But I didn't let
them shave her head

46:53.360 --> 46:54.900
And the balance 3 rupees?

46:55.740 --> 46:58.400
I could have said she
cost me 803 rupees, no?

46:59.650 --> 47:02.950
Look at this.
It costs 7 rupees in the market

47:03.240 --> 47:05.950
I got it for 3,
so you take it for 3

47:06.860 --> 47:10.650
This cargo was headed to America
but was sent back here

47:11.450 --> 47:15.240
There's widespread poverty.
People have no money there

47:16.650 --> 47:18.200
Bad times!

47:21.530 --> 47:22.860
Keep this as a gift

47:23.070 --> 47:25.070
It's too good to
give away for free

47:25.240 --> 47:28.200
Want to see a parrot?
There's one here, look

47:38.030 --> 47:39.200
Who is she?

47:41.150 --> 47:42.700
Didn't you want a maid?

47:43.070 --> 47:46.400
Yes. But how do you know
she's any good?

47:46.820 --> 47:49.740
-I've checked, she's good.
-See, he knows

47:50.530 --> 47:52.200
Where will she stay?

47:54.450 --> 47:57.110
-How about upstairs?
-She'll stay anywhere

47:57.700 --> 47:59.570
Show her upstairs

48:02.780 --> 48:05.070
How are times any better here?

48:05.820 --> 48:08.320
It's that Gandhi's undoing!

48:08.360 --> 48:10.570
-Listen
-This "Women Empowerment" speech ...

48:11.240 --> 48:13.360
has brainwashed them

48:14.780 --> 48:17.200
The British government is great

48:18.360 --> 48:20.990
Sure, they interfere with
our religion ...

48:21.320 --> 48:22.650
But, what can you do?

49:00.450 --> 49:01.740
What is it?

49:04.070 --> 49:06.990
If you give me another 50 ...

49:07.150 --> 49:10.400
I'll tell you where
I got this 50 from

49:14.530 --> 49:17.200
What if your information
is not worth 50?

49:19.320 --> 49:21.030
What if it's worth millions?

49:31.030 --> 49:31.860
Take

49:36.900 --> 49:38.030
He asked me ...

49:38.610 --> 49:40.400
to spend the night with you

49:40.570 --> 49:42.450
-What did he say?
-For two nights ...

49:42.950 --> 49:44.280
and two days ...

49:45.070 --> 49:47.150
not to let you
leave town

49:58.740 --> 50:00.070
To make sure ...

50:02.610 --> 50:03.950
for next 2 days ...

50:04.400 --> 50:07.650
you don't leave the town

01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:23.240
Go to sleep, Raghav ...

01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:29.150
Go to sleep or else 'Hastar'
will come for you!

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.990
Hastar!

01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:12.530
I know what you've been up to

01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:18.240
Right under my nose?
How dare you, you?

01:03:32.570 --> 01:03:37.280
Sister, I haven't even
touched your husband

01:03:40.030 --> 01:03:42.610
I know all your tricks,
you dirty, lying witch!

01:03:43.950 --> 01:03:46.570
I'm going to throw you out

01:03:48.200 --> 01:03:49.200
What happened?

01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:51.200
She stole my brooch

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.740
I did no such thing

01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:55.700
I didn't choose to come here.
I have had enough ...

01:03:55.900 --> 01:03:56.740
Quiet!

01:03:57.650 --> 01:03:59.700
I'll break your face
if I hear another word

01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:02.400
You won't live here anymore

01:04:02.570 --> 01:04:03.950
Get out!

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:05.200
You will not stay here!

01:04:06.450 --> 01:04:07.740
What happened?

01:04:08.070 --> 01:04:10.860
-She can't live in our house anymore.
- Huh?

01:07:10.030 --> 01:07:11.360
Empty, again?

01:07:13.030 --> 01:07:15.110
This is the third time in a year

01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:16.110
Quiet!

01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:18.070
Hold your tongue

01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:21.700
Tired of your whining

01:07:26.780 --> 01:07:28.450
Seems to have forgotten her place

01:07:28.610 --> 01:07:31.860
I say this because I'm
worried about you

01:07:33.150 --> 01:07:36.320
You can't run like this
all your life

01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:41.200
When will your boy be ready?

01:07:44.530 --> 01:07:46.530
He's of no use

01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:24.609
Father, training was great today

01:08:24.859 --> 01:08:27.569
I picked 8 coins in my 19th attempt

01:08:41.240 --> 01:08:43.359
What's the most you've ever picked?

01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:16.779
Yes ...

01:09:23.609 --> 01:09:25.240
I can't arrange this week either

01:09:25.399 --> 01:09:27.569
Let's talk next week

01:09:28.069 --> 01:09:30.529
Yes, good night

01:09:45.490 --> 01:09:49.029
I'm going to Tumbbad tomorrow.
Keep Pandurang ready

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.070
Really? Father said this?

01:09:56.450 --> 01:10:00.070
Yes. Tomorrow, you will also
go to Tumbbad

01:10:00.990 --> 01:10:03.740
It's time you start
helping your father

01:10:04.150 --> 01:10:05.860
What happens there, though?

01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.530
I don't know

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:13.610
What do I have to do?

01:10:17.450 --> 01:10:19.110
You'll know soon ...

01:10:20.610 --> 01:10:22.150
then, you tell me

01:11:48.030 --> 01:11:50.490
You'd said you'd take me
when I am 16

01:11:50.610 --> 01:11:53.320
-But I learnt quickly ...
-Speak softly, I'm not deaf!

01:11:56.570 --> 01:12:00.360
When were you ready?
At my age or at 16?

01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:03.200
You are not ready yet!

01:12:09.070 --> 01:12:10.860
What's in Tumbbad?

01:12:14.450 --> 01:12:16.860
If there was a god
whose mere touch ...

01:12:17.740 --> 01:12:19.240
would turn you immortal ...

01:12:19.490 --> 01:12:21.280
letting you live for centuries ...

01:12:22.990 --> 01:12:24.820
and you'd know where
the eternal treasure is

01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:27.150
All you have to do
is eat and sleep

01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:29.950
Would you want that?

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:33.110
Who wouldn't want
such a blessing?

01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:36.610
One knows it's not a blessing ...

01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:39.280
but a curse worse than death!

01:12:44.950 --> 01:12:47.240
I think I'll be coming
back home alone today

01:12:48.570 --> 01:12:49.530
Why, father?

01:12:50.780 --> 01:12:53.200
Father, I'm just like you

01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:54.740
I'm not afraid of anything!

01:12:58.400 --> 01:12:59.610
I'm not scaring you ...

01:13:00.240 --> 01:13:03.570
just preparing you
for what lies ahead

01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:08.950
Is that God the same one ...

01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:11.700
"Sleep or else Hastar will..."
-Shh ...

01:13:12.450 --> 01:13:13.900
Don't utter his name

01:13:15.490 --> 01:13:17.610
He appears even if you
take his name?

01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:29.360
Since that day, the Gods' wrath
has rained on Tumbbad

01:13:30.490 --> 01:13:32.240
But why did they wake him up?

01:13:32.820 --> 01:13:35.950
Because Hastar's curse
is a boon for us

01:13:36.530 --> 01:13:37.400
What do you mean?

01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:40.400
You'll know when you go inside

01:13:41.530 --> 01:13:42.530
Inside what?

01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:46.400
The Goddess's womb

01:14:29.570 --> 01:14:33.360
Mix in these pebbles.
He chews through them

01:14:34.450 --> 01:14:35.990
It buys us more time

01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:46.070
Listen ...

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:49.990
We here just to practice today.
We won't need these inside

01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:12.400
Scared already?
We haven't even begun

01:15:17.320 --> 01:15:21.400
Make a circle. It keeps us safe.
He cannot enter it

01:15:21.860 --> 01:15:23.280
What if he tries to?

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:25.070
It will destroy him

01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:30.900
Remember, he took the gold,
but couldn't get the grains

01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:34.240
Hence, he yearns for
flour and dreads it too

01:15:34.570 --> 01:15:36.320
But what if Hastar bites you?

01:15:36.530 --> 01:15:38.860
You'll be cursed like grandmother.
Get it here

01:15:51.360 --> 01:15:52.450
Is that the grandmother?

01:15:52.650 --> 01:15:55.030
No, he was my friend

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:56.490
Did Hastar do this?

01:15:57.570 --> 01:15:58.320
Yes

01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:04.280
When will Hastar come?

01:16:05.820 --> 01:16:07.900
When we offer him the dough doll

01:16:08.150 --> 01:16:11.860
But we're just practicing,
that's why we didn't bring it

01:16:12.530 --> 01:16:14.030
Pull this from here

01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:18.820
But I got the doll

01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:24.320
Run, you fool!

01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:25.990
Father!

01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:46.150
Wait for me, father

01:16:58.150 --> 01:16:59.610
You, greedy scum!

01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.780
Didn't I ask you to
not get the doll?

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:05.240
Didn't I?

01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:07.950
Sorry ...

01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:13.650
Stay here.
Or I'll chop your head off!

01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.070
Look over there

01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:29.530
Has gone even blind now

01:17:35.610 --> 01:17:38.030
Keep it safe,
It's your first earning

01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:42.200
How much will I get
if I sell this?

01:17:42.780 --> 01:17:45.030
Give it back ... quick!

01:17:45.320 --> 01:17:47.030
I'll keep it safe

01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:49.450
Until I don't ask for it

01:17:53.530 --> 01:17:55.530
Tell me, what was there?

01:17:57.320 --> 01:17:59.490
That's between father and me

01:18:00.450 --> 01:18:01.900
You focus on household chores

01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.570
Unwrap it

01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:52.530
Eat it

01:19:11.490 --> 01:19:13.530
Your father gave this to you?

01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:17.530
Does he like it too?

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:20.650
He doesn't like anything

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.700
Then what's the point?

01:19:27.490 --> 01:19:29.450
What do you mean?

01:19:32.990 --> 01:19:34.570
Mother, what do you mean?

01:19:37.320 --> 01:19:41.740
Greetings to the free
citizen of free India

01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.150
Welcome Raja Sahib

01:19:46.530 --> 01:19:49.900
This is for the
new water station

01:19:51.570 --> 01:19:53.950
Name it after my wife

01:19:59.150 --> 01:20:03.860
Now that India is free,
how will you keep busy?

01:20:04.740 --> 01:20:08.110
You think our freedom struggle
was to keep us busy?

01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:10.280
No?

01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:13.450
You're insulting me

01:20:14.240 --> 01:20:17.400
This land they looted and
partitioned is yours too

01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:22.610
That's why we seek your donation ...
and your sympathy

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:30.150
Forget sympathy,
take more donation

01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:38.740
Your house is decaying.
Doesn't match your stature

01:20:40.240 --> 01:20:42.820
It's time you buy a grander mansion

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:46.360
-I have one in Tumbbad ...
-Tumbbad?

01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:48.530
Tumbbad has been given away last week

01:20:50.570 --> 01:20:51.570
What?

01:20:51.950 --> 01:20:54.360
If only you'd listened to me

01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:56.860
We would've drawn out legal papers
and it would have been yours

01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:59.360
Tumbbad is under the
lordship of 7 barons

01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:01.900
I take good care of each of them

01:21:02.530 --> 01:21:05.490
-That's between you and the barons.
-Whom did they give away Tumbbad to?

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.150
To the new Sarkar

01:21:09.150 --> 01:21:09.990
Who is this Sarkar?

01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:11.740
The Indian Government

01:21:13.490 --> 01:21:15.320
It's a decrepit mansion anyway

01:21:16.450 --> 01:21:20.070
They'll build a new village there

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:25.860
I'll look for something else
that matches your status

01:21:28.110 --> 01:21:29.650
Namaste

01:21:57.990 --> 01:21:59.070
What is it?

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:03.900
Why are you standing
like that?

01:22:05.030 --> 01:22:06.450
What are you staring at?

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.990
Should I wake up everybody?

01:22:17.900 --> 01:22:19.700
Father tells you everything,
doesn't he?

01:22:20.570 --> 01:22:22.320
He must've told you
about this as well

01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:25.610
I'm his partner now

01:22:26.070 --> 01:22:28.530
And soon I'll be the only one
running the show

01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:31.530
You do know what I mean, right?

01:22:33.280 --> 01:22:35.610
Father has kept you
as a mistress ...

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:39.320
No big deal in that.
Everyone has one

01:22:41.610 --> 01:22:44.820
But when I grow up,
I'll marry you

01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:50.200
Are you crazy?

01:22:52.530 --> 01:22:53.740
How old are you?

01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:57.240
Does that matter to you?

01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:34.150
If not Tumbbad, at least
the mansion is ours, right?

01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:39.820
The government will lock it up too

01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.070
But why?

01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:44.610
You fool

01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:46.320
Come here

01:23:47.490 --> 01:23:48.740
Idiot

01:24:06.110 --> 01:24:08.030
Take the keys, stupid

01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:10.110
Here

01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:14.650
Open

01:24:18.860 --> 01:24:19.700
Pull harder

01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:30.320
So much gold!

01:24:30.990 --> 01:24:33.030
This will last a lifetime

01:24:34.490 --> 01:24:36.700
You're just like my mother

01:24:36.860 --> 01:24:40.530
She thought a coin
would last a lifetime

01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:54.610
Mother!

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:57.530
Father!

01:24:59.650 --> 01:25:01.240
Wake up, father!

01:25:05.450 --> 01:25:10.400
Father ... wake up please

01:25:25.900 --> 01:25:27.820
You want to be a man, huh?

01:25:27.820 --> 01:25:30.200
I'll break your other leg too!

01:25:30.610 --> 01:25:31.490
Bastard!

01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:34.240
Just because I spoke to you,
you think you can fool me?

01:25:35.950 --> 01:25:36.700
What are you looking at?

01:25:37.650 --> 01:25:39.450
Want to gift her a coin, huh?

01:25:58.570 --> 01:25:59.320
Stop!

01:25:59.820 --> 01:26:02.360
Where are you going?
-To get my coin back

01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.400
You want your coin?
Let me give you one

01:26:05.570 --> 01:26:07.070
-MOTHER!
-Today you'll die

01:26:07.450 --> 01:26:08.490
I'm going to wring your neck

01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:11.070
Tie you to a rock
and throw you in a river

01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:13.240
That should take care of you

01:26:14.860 --> 01:26:16.280
Mother!

01:26:18.030 --> 01:26:20.650
You've been doing it
the wrong way all along

01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:23.400
You will teach me what
is right, huh?

01:26:23.650 --> 01:26:28.200
The coins are in its loincloth,
so why not just steal the loincloth?

01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:30.990
-What?
-Let's steal 'Hastar's' loincloth

01:26:31.650 --> 01:26:35.610
You want 'Hastar's' loincloth, bastard?
How much time can we buy with that doll?

01:26:35.700 --> 01:26:37.740
We pick what we can and run!

01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:40.780
We will take many dolls

01:26:41.650 --> 01:26:45.240
As soon as he picks one,
we'll throw another and so on

01:26:53.570 --> 01:26:54.650
Father ...

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:58.070
it won't take us long
to steal the loincloth

01:27:08.150 --> 01:27:09.740
Will he eat so many dolls?

01:27:10.450 --> 01:27:12.950
Didn't you say
he's always hungry?

01:27:15.490 --> 01:27:17.070
I know it's difficult

01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:22.240
But it's possible

01:27:23.610 --> 01:27:24.650
Come here

01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:34.150
Father, I am sorry.
I will not do it again

01:27:34.360 --> 01:27:37.950
Remain in your pants for a few years.
We'll get you married soon!

01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:40.150
And till then?

01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:47.400
And till then!

01:27:58.650 --> 01:28:02.400
He plays hide and seek, like the Reaper

01:28:02.650 --> 01:28:06.240
Spins a web of laughter and cries

01:28:06.650 --> 01:28:10.240
He stares into your soul with lust

01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:14.280
Hits you at every turn, like kingdom come

01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:18.280
For ages he has starved

01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:22.280
Waiting unfulfilled, unnourished

01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:26.280
He endlessly eats stones-pebbles-wheat

01:28:26.650 --> 01:28:30.240
Eternally thirsty, drinks with gruesome greed

01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:36.030
Ears quiver, bearings adrift

01:28:38.570 --> 01:28:44.070
He's the god of death,
life and heart shiver

01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:53.240
Come, come conquer Tumbbad.

01:28:53.990 --> 01:29:02.110
Go, go revel in Tumbbad

01:29:02.610 --> 01:29:08.110
The clouds erupt, yet my soul
Burns like an ember

01:29:10.610 --> 01:29:17.860
Every moment, my mind splits, my body
is pierced . The world is up in the air

01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:49.740
Come here

01:29:51.610 --> 01:29:53.070
Hold this

01:29:55.360 --> 01:29:56.950
Shall we begin, father?

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:50.530
Stop! Put the dolls back!

01:30:54.110 --> 01:30:57.200
Father!

01:33:36.450 --> 01:33:38.860
Father! Please, no
