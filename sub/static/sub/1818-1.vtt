<i>The Demons were suppressed

Didn't you always wish

05:19.639 --> 05:23.514
that Deities and Demons,

05:24.764 --> 05:27.551
I can make this wish come true.

11:36.583 --> 11:38.065
Master Puti,

11:38.128 --> 11:40.315
I've come about a clever monkey.

11:40.401 --> 11:42.808
He was born out of Nuwa's crystals.

11:42.879 --> 11:44.621
Properly trained and educated,

11:44.669 --> 11:46.874
he could bring
virtue to mankind.

11:48.211 --> 11:49.911
But, this monkey was born

11:49.935 --> 11:52.505
with as much vice as virtue.
I'm afraid I...

11:52.567 --> 11:54.800
Therfore, you must
teach him patiently

11:54.833 --> 11:56.669
and lead him to goodness.

17:45.770 --> 17:48.674

as the South Gate,

17:48.775 --> 17:52.984

17:53.852 --> 17:55.884
Relying on one person's powers,

17:56.076 --> 17:58.576

<i>He's the likeliest choice,

We've become

18:32.833 --> 18:35.427
Attacking Heaven is not
a sure bet, on any day.

18:35.465 --> 18:38.700
The Demon Clan will never

19:29.262 --> 19:30.863
Come down and practice.

19:30.997 --> 19:32.509
It's old hat.

19:33.436 --> 19:35.974
Never mind him.
He's just boasting.

19:36.064 --> 19:38.333
Once a monkey, always a monkey.

19:38.364 --> 19:40.646
Surely, you can't expect
to become Immortal.

19:40.684 --> 19:44.739
That's true. Do you think wearing

20:01.490 --> 20:02.930
Not a person, huh?!

20:02.983 --> 20:04.590
I'm not a person?

20:05.303 --> 20:07.840
- Brother, don't!
- Out of my way!

20:08.779 --> 20:10.195
Why did you do that?

20:10.244 --> 20:12.317
I'll get even with him.

20:25.397 --> 20:26.892
Brother!

20:27.424 --> 20:28.873
Come on!

21:18.831 --> 21:20.232
Careful!

22:00.489 --> 22:03.289
- The Master!
- The Master's here!

22:03.700 --> 22:05.114
Master.

22:07.903 --> 22:10.633
He'll be all right.
Quick get him up.

22:12.200 --> 22:15.247
Wukong,
if you keep up this nonsense,

22:15.349 --> 22:18.011
I'm afraid you'll never learn
anything.

22:18.042 --> 22:21.938
Huh?! Master, I've mastered the 72
transformations. I work very hard!

22:21.963 --> 22:23.800
Even if you master
1,000 transformations,

22:23.833 --> 22:26.199
but your mind isn't transformed,
what's the use?

22:26.233 --> 22:28.245
Master, he beat me up!

22:28.509 --> 22:31.469
He teased me.
He said I wasn't a person.

22:42.156 --> 22:44.364
Wukong, come with me.

22:49.996 --> 22:51.483
No problem.

22:58.295 --> 23:00.811
Master, where are you going?

23:17.368 --> 23:19.991
Wukong, are you awake, yet?

23:21.797 --> 23:23.520
That was amazing!

23:23.539 --> 23:25.362
Apparently, not.

23:25.387 --> 23:27.688
What did you just see?

23:29.591 --> 23:31.082
I had a dream.

23:31.208 --> 23:32.855
Not a dream.

23:33.131 --> 23:35.190
It's your destiny.

23:36.222 --> 23:37.823
Exactly.

23:39.437 --> 23:42.113
Master, meeting you
is my destiny.

23:42.631 --> 23:44.642
Your true destiny is...

23:45.172 --> 23:47.516
to be rent apart by lightning,

23:47.579 --> 23:50.441
burned by fire, and
blown off course by storms.

23:50.486 --> 23:52.588
If you can avoid them,
you'll live forever.

23:52.609 --> 23:54.892
If not, your innards
will turn to ashes,

23:54.915 --> 23:57.006
and your body will
destroy itself.

23:58.889 --> 24:00.491
What should I do?

24:00.553 --> 24:02.116
It's hard to say.

24:02.688 --> 24:04.329
Will I die?

24:04.354 --> 24:06.155
All living things must die.

24:09.385 --> 24:13.435
What about the Resurrection Spell?
Teach me, so I won't die.

24:14.254 --> 24:15.982
That, I cannot teach you.

24:16.323 --> 24:19.001
But an oil lamp can be lit
and re-lit,

24:19.050 --> 24:21.861
as long as the wick itself
isn't burned away.

24:22.009 --> 24:24.644
How can I fix it,
so I don't burn out?

24:24.691 --> 24:27.704
That's up to you.
That's your fate.

24:28.754 --> 24:30.182
Master...

24:31.665 --> 24:33.346
up to me?

24:37.801 --> 24:40.029
Are you sending me away?

25:05.471 --> 25:09.136
It's cold up in the sky,
dress warmly as you fly around.

25:09.284 --> 25:11.041
Take care of yourself.

25:19.782 --> 25:21.881
Somersault Cloud teleportation!

25:43.803 --> 25:46.771
It must be boring being
a gatekeeper God.

25:46.918 --> 25:49.513
I didn't think you'd dare come.

25:49.668 --> 25:51.940
Aren't you afraid I'll arrest you?

25:52.052 --> 25:53.630
Obviously...

25:54.944 --> 25:57.934
since you took the risk
of meeting me,

25:58.379 --> 26:00.942
it means you also need me.

26:01.102 --> 26:03.038
I came to arrest you.

26:03.204 --> 26:04.658
Afterwards,

26:04.696 --> 26:06.651
the Jade Emperor will reward me

26:06.682 --> 26:09.454
with command of a host of millions
in the Heavenly Army.

26:09.485 --> 26:12.121
How can you expect anything
from that stupid Emperor?

26:12.146 --> 26:15.267
Erlang's power is renowned
throughout the Three Realms!

26:15.276 --> 26:18.103
Yet, you're satisfied being
a doorman.

26:19.300 --> 26:21.054
Enough talk.

26:21.929 --> 26:24.420
You can't rely on me, alone.

26:25.188 --> 26:27.185
You want to attack Heaven?

26:27.230 --> 26:29.029
I couldn't care less.

26:29.361 --> 26:31.273
I just want Lingxiao Hall.
(throne)

26:31.309 --> 26:34.420
Then, it seems,
we'll soon have Heaven.

26:34.543 --> 26:37.122
But, you won't be able to
breach the South Gate.

26:37.161 --> 26:38.724
Any Demon

26:38.778 --> 26:40.325
who even approaches it,

26:40.380 --> 26:42.285
will be reduced to ashes.

26:43.574 --> 26:47.128
Success or failure depends on
that Crystal Stone Monkey.

26:50.860 --> 26:54.124
The Demon King of Confusion is here.
Run!

27:01.945 --> 27:03.677
Let's hide in here!

27:06.393 --> 27:10.299
<i>Looks like a wonderful place,
here behind Water Curtain Cave.</i>

27:14.746 --> 27:17.946
Who dares to touch
my monkey kinfolk?

27:25.826 --> 27:30.286
Don't you ever come back to
Huaguo Shan*! (Flower-Fruit Mountain)

27:30.340 --> 27:32.487
I won't. I won't.

27:54.602 --> 27:56.274
You can be our chief.

27:56.299 --> 28:00.388
The Handsome Monkey King of
Water Curtain Cave on Huaguo Shan!

28:04.982 --> 28:07.512
Handsome Monkey King!
Handsome Monkey King!

28:07.599 --> 28:09.240
I'm your Handsome Monkey King.

28:09.277 --> 28:11.681
From now on, I'll protect you.

28:13.249 --> 28:15.864
But, what if you're
not here, King?

28:15.903 --> 28:17.945
Who'll protect us, then?

28:21.499 --> 28:24.633
Have no fear.
I'll find you some weapons.

28:24.686 --> 28:26.862
Weapons! Weapons!

28:27.535 --> 28:29.080
Come. Come.

28:29.477 --> 28:30.889
Where?

28:30.960 --> 28:32.849
Under this bridge
there's a way to reach

28:32.880 --> 28:34.900
the Dragon Palace of
the Eastern Seas.

28:34.978 --> 28:38.132
It's full of treasures, but the
water is deep and dangerous.

28:38.160 --> 28:41.390
If Your Majesty could go and
get us some weapons,

28:41.446 --> 28:43.773
then we could protect ourselves.

28:45.193 --> 28:46.843
Wait till I get back.

28:49.529 --> 28:51.904
This is really high!

29:00.945 --> 29:02.472
Dinnertime!

29:03.112 --> 29:04.585
Dinnertime. Oh, dinnertime.

29:04.664 --> 29:05.960
I'm starving.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.830
Food, food, food!

29:07.931 --> 29:09.369
I'm hungry!

29:15.024 --> 29:16.638
I'm full.

29:46.447 --> 29:48.026
Good girl.

29:49.696 --> 29:51.943
I've raised you from a little cub.

29:51.969 --> 29:54.702
Now, it's time you did
something for me.

29:55.827 --> 29:58.623
Go look up your old friend
in Huaguo Shan.

29:58.679 --> 30:00.432
Whatever happens,

30:00.690 --> 30:02.135
don't be scared.

30:02.275 --> 30:03.733
Don't be nervous.

30:03.779 --> 30:05.193
Don't ask questions.

30:05.446 --> 30:07.258
Just stay by his side.

30:07.581 --> 30:10.900
Never reveal your relationship to me.

30:10.959 --> 30:13.129
- Understand?
- M-hm.

30:31.151 --> 30:33.094
<i>Buddy, I'm telling you...</i>

30:33.362 --> 30:35.480
<i>I'll give you just one chance to...</i>

30:45.075 --> 30:47.036
[ DRAGON KING OF THE EAST SEA ]

30:47.193 --> 30:50.944
Listen up guys.
From now on, you're safe.

30:54.939 --> 30:59.098
There was this big, ugly, nasty fish.

30:59.185 --> 31:02.487
I killed it for you.
Is there a reward?

31:02.767 --> 31:05.610
You!...
You killed my gatekeeper?

31:06.125 --> 31:07.623
You!...

31:08.315 --> 31:10.547
What kind of God are you?

31:11.232 --> 31:12.589
I'm your neighbor,

31:12.614 --> 31:15.950
the Handsome Monkey King
from Huaguo Shan, Sun Wukong.

31:16.414 --> 31:18.492
I, um... came to borrow

31:18.539 --> 31:21.227
some weapons, from you.

31:21.289 --> 31:23.210
You want to borrow weapons?

31:23.301 --> 31:25.943
Prime Minister, Turtle,
lend him some weapons.

31:26.013 --> 31:27.464
Yes sir.

31:27.540 --> 31:29.042
Kill him.

31:29.654 --> 31:31.152
All right!

31:38.863 --> 31:40.541
- Dragon King...
- Come.

31:49.683 --> 31:51.308
You tricked me!

32:22.383 --> 32:24.134
I want this one!

32:24.320 --> 32:25.720
Don't come near me!

32:25.844 --> 32:27.273
Transform...

32:30.159 --> 32:31.737
Shrink!

32:33.329 --> 32:37.158
Dragon King, give this demon some
inferior weapons to get rid of him.

32:37.166 --> 32:38.974
Then we can sue him in Heaven.

32:39.157 --> 32:41.780
- Quick, go get them.
- Yes, sir.

32:41.822 --> 32:43.455
Bring out the weapons!

33:01.299 --> 33:02.610
Bring them all.

33:02.635 --> 33:04.926
You can take them all.

33:09.196 --> 33:11.110
What's that?

33:11.242 --> 33:13.435
Ah, these are cloud-walking boots,

33:13.520 --> 33:15.261
Golden chain mail shirt

33:15.318 --> 33:17.115
and phoenix-feather cap.

33:17.172 --> 33:18.631
They have a magical quality.

33:18.686 --> 33:21.123
If worn by a good person,
they look elegant.

33:21.162 --> 33:24.014
If worn by a bad person,
they look tawdry.

33:24.047 --> 33:26.740
Put them on, let's see
if you're a good or a bad guy.

33:26.772 --> 33:28.137
Transform!

33:32.931 --> 33:36.259
When I was young
I looked better in them.

33:38.587 --> 33:39.988
Transform!

33:43.946 --> 33:45.532
You wear it well.

33:46.438 --> 33:48.703
- Classy.
- Not bad, huh?

33:53.240 --> 33:55.083
Don't take them away.

33:55.126 --> 33:56.358
It's a perfect fit.

33:56.422 --> 33:58.087
You can't take those!

33:58.157 --> 34:01.529
They're treasured gifts
from my three brothers.

34:01.567 --> 34:03.716
When I'm done, I'll return them.

34:06.622 --> 34:08.873
You can't take that away.

34:10.864 --> 34:12.428
Come back!

34:40.357 --> 34:42.771
Huh?...*

35:00.281 --> 35:01.930
Handsome Monkey King.

35:01.978 --> 35:04.352
This monument was left by
The Great Yu.

35:04.372 --> 35:07.057
It's his measuring rod,
when he plumbed the depths

35:07.072 --> 35:08.657
of the Great World Flood.

35:08.682 --> 35:11.880
It's a divine artifact.
No one may move it.

35:11.945 --> 35:14.563
Dragon King, no one's ever
even budged it.

35:14.601 --> 35:16.000
Don't worry.

35:17.379 --> 35:18.756
All right...

35:18.800 --> 35:22.050
if you can pull it out,
you can take it with you.

35:22.084 --> 35:24.341
I'll hold you to your word.

35:31.922 --> 35:33.544
Upsy da...

35:48.762 --> 35:50.237
Shrink!

37:34.901 --> 37:36.591
My Lady, what's wrong?

38:30.962 --> 38:32.256
Are you all right?

38:32.287 --> 38:35.308
Illusion is as boundless

38:35.472 --> 38:39.115
as a sea of clouds
blocking the light of day.

38:39.361 --> 38:41.703
He, who caused this tsunami,

38:41.800 --> 38:44.784
is the crystal monkey.

38:44.834 --> 38:47.516
The second of three signs!

38:47.750 --> 38:50.538
Our opportunity is at hand!

38:53.510 --> 38:56.196
What happened
in the Eastern Sea?

38:57.598 --> 38:59.940
Don't worry about these things.

39:00.318 --> 39:02.136
Let's go inside.

39:10.138 --> 39:11.638
Where are we going?

39:11.803 --> 39:14.769
To our new home.
We're almost there.

39:14.879 --> 39:16.702
I'm so tired.

39:34.075 --> 39:35.516
Go away!

39:39.194 --> 39:40.749
Go away!

39:45.270 --> 39:46.985
Go away!

40:08.925 --> 40:10.349
3103,

40:10.975 --> 40:12.469
3104,

40:13.106 --> 40:14.588
3105,

40:15.010 --> 40:16.474
3106.

40:17.545 --> 40:19.542
What kind of Demon are you,

40:19.598 --> 40:21.936
who dares trespass
in my Huaguo Shan?

40:23.680 --> 40:25.122
Speak up!

40:39.257 --> 40:40.771
It's me...

40:41.552 --> 40:43.253
the fox cub.

40:43.896 --> 40:45.872
We met when we were little.

40:46.615 --> 40:48.629
Do you remember me?

41:23.479 --> 41:24.924
It's you...

41:31.482 --> 41:33.797
I remember you, fox girl.

41:34.122 --> 41:36.291
- I remember you.
- Monkey boy!

41:36.622 --> 41:38.169
I WAS the monkey boy,

41:38.232 --> 41:41.245
but now I'm the
Handsome Monkey King.

41:42.619 --> 41:45.940
Handsome Monkey King.
I'm the Handsome Monkey King.

41:46.010 --> 41:48.818
- Who is he?
- Her old boyfriend.

41:49.013 --> 41:50.877
Huh?... A monkey?!

41:51.015 --> 41:52.718
I really missed you!

41:53.888 --> 41:55.482
Fox girl.

41:56.021 --> 41:57.675
What brings you here?

41:57.903 --> 42:01.128
Our home was
destroyed by a flood.

42:05.328 --> 42:07.422
Would that be, yesterday's...

42:07.883 --> 42:09.485
huge flood?

42:09.559 --> 42:10.892
Right.

42:12.288 --> 42:15.277
- You can live here.
- I have a lot of companions.

42:15.316 --> 42:17.294
We don't want to be a bother.

42:17.340 --> 42:19.726
Stop this nonsense, c'mon!

42:24.850 --> 42:26.335
Don't be afraid.

42:27.410 --> 42:28.899
Slow down!

42:31.510 --> 42:33.878
Look, this mountain is mine.

42:36.281 --> 42:37.790
This is also mine.

42:38.982 --> 42:40.599
It's all mine.

42:58.766 --> 43:00.889
Wait here, I'll be right back.

43:14.810 --> 43:16.146
Dragon King.

43:16.176 --> 43:18.746
What happened?
You seem flustered.

43:18.821 --> 43:20.258
Oh, Viceroy Erlang,

43:20.283 --> 43:22.992
my Palace of the East
is no more.

43:23.101 --> 43:25.193
My Palace treasures are all gone.

43:25.200 --> 43:26.785
Including my greatest one,

43:26.794 --> 43:29.250
the Gold Banded Measuring Rod of Yu.

43:29.256 --> 43:32.052
We four, Dragon Kings,
had a meeting.

43:32.099 --> 43:34.538
The South Sea King
is second oldest.

43:34.695 --> 43:37.476
The West Sea King
is the youngest.

43:37.588 --> 43:39.723
The North Sea King
is the eldest.

43:39.784 --> 43:41.263
We all agreed,

43:41.341 --> 43:43.372
I must see the Jade Emperor.

43:43.450 --> 43:45.300
I want to press charges.

43:45.404 --> 43:49.859
- Who'd dare do that to you?
- A monkey demon from Huaguo Shan.

43:49.954 --> 43:52.019
- Monkey demon?
- Uhuh.

43:52.499 --> 43:54.264
For such a small matter

43:54.315 --> 43:56.352
don't bother the Jade Emperor.

43:57.183 --> 43:59.093
I'll take care of it for you.

44:00.312 --> 44:02.275
- Nezha.
- Here I am.

44:04.325 --> 44:07.740
Go to Huaguo Shan, arrest that
Demon Monkey and bring him here.

44:07.799 --> 44:09.113
Demon Monkey?

44:09.138 --> 44:12.334
You represent Heaven's Court.
So, no mistakes!

44:14.133 --> 44:16.745
Don't you get tired
of riding that thing?

44:16.812 --> 44:20.069
Don't you get tired of minding
other people's business?

44:34.899 --> 44:36.374
I'm back.

44:40.291 --> 44:41.776
Eat, eat.

44:42.819 --> 44:44.699
See how shiny my hair is?

44:44.723 --> 44:46.286
That's because I eat this.

44:46.325 --> 44:47.872
Yum, yum... Eat up.

44:53.305 --> 44:55.896
I've known you a long time,
but not your name.

44:55.949 --> 44:58.980
- I'm called Ruxue*.
- Oh, Ruxue*. (Snowflake)

44:59.059 --> 45:01.126
I'm called Wukong. Wukong.

45:14.060 --> 45:16.643
You used to be
just a monkey boy.

45:16.846 --> 45:19.610
And now, you're the
Handsome Monkey King!

45:20.669 --> 45:23.286
You've grown up, too.
You used to be this small.

45:23.341 --> 45:24.857
Now you're this big!

45:24.915 --> 45:27.713
I'm still young.
I'm just 120 years old.

45:27.733 --> 45:29.351
How old are you?

45:31.966 --> 45:33.386
I don't know.

45:33.450 --> 45:35.060
You look pretty young.

45:35.099 --> 45:36.763
You're 250, I'd say.

45:36.888 --> 45:38.404
250 years old?

45:38.786 --> 45:41.732
250... I'm 250*! (*dopey)

45:42.390 --> 45:45.412
Minor demons like me
can live 200 years.

45:45.512 --> 45:47.674
Then, we die.

45:49.490 --> 45:51.867
After you die,
you can be reborn.

45:52.007 --> 45:53.913
I should be so lucky!

45:55.059 --> 45:56.878
So, I cherish every day.

45:57.026 --> 45:59.435
Every day I watch the sunrise.

45:59.472 --> 46:02.442
Sure, 'cause the sun rises
every day.

46:06.051 --> 46:08.003
Here's another sunrise!

46:26.092 --> 46:27.522
Huh?

46:28.701 --> 46:31.405
The sunrise looks different, today.

46:32.967 --> 46:34.608
The sunrise looks...

46:34.645 --> 46:36.641
REALLY DIFFERENT!

46:42.636 --> 46:44.950
Monkey Demon:
for wrecking the Dragon Palace,

46:44.997 --> 46:47.404
causing a tsunami,
stealing the Gold Banded Rod,

46:47.442 --> 46:48.950
and now, harboring renegade demons,

46:48.991 --> 46:51.361
you will come with me
to Heaven to stand trial.

47:01.351 --> 47:02.988
Who are you?

47:03.260 --> 47:05.955
I was sent down by Erlang.
I'm Nezha.

47:10.094 --> 47:12.560
Aah! My tail is on fire!

47:12.748 --> 47:15.060
My tail's on fire!

47:29.269 --> 47:31.785
Are you all right?
Sit down.

47:33.602 --> 47:35.075
Transform!

47:40.299 --> 47:41.791
Take that!

49:10.979 --> 49:13.325
And who are you?

49:17.701 --> 49:19.734
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

49:28.090 --> 49:30.101
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

49:32.872 --> 49:34.547
So, who are you?

49:34.596 --> 49:38.005
He's the ruler of Flame Mountain:
Bull Demon King!

49:38.021 --> 49:39.326
Thank you.

49:39.333 --> 49:42.308
I saw an injustice
and I lent a hand.

49:42.323 --> 49:44.272
He's a good friend to have.

49:44.333 --> 49:48.068
He's our Handsome Monkey King
of Huaguo Shan. Ever heard of him?

49:48.177 --> 49:50.252
Handsome Monkey King!
Monkey King!

49:50.547 --> 49:52.191
I'm Sun Wukong.

49:52.607 --> 49:55.537
The tidal wave was your doing?

50:00.705 --> 50:04.000
Jade Emperor, that Monkey Demon
is causing evil in the world.

50:04.005 --> 50:07.957
He's, now, allied to the Demon Clan
and must be brought to heel.

50:07.998 --> 50:09.835
He is not a Monkey Demon.

50:10.023 --> 50:12.842
He's name is Wukong.
He's my disciple.

50:13.488 --> 50:17.049
He was born of Lady Nuwa's
crystals that restored Heaven.

50:17.082 --> 50:20.109
He has Divine Essence, but,
is a diamond in the rough.

50:20.122 --> 50:22.232
He just needs a little polishing.

50:22.429 --> 50:24.825
Jade Emperor, he may be unruly,

50:24.870 --> 50:26.552
but he's good natured.

50:26.614 --> 50:28.548
His inability to
rein in his impulses

50:28.573 --> 50:30.278
is to blame for today's disaster.

50:30.310 --> 50:34.450
Thanks to Nuwa's crystal sacrifice,

50:34.505 --> 50:36.094
to restore Heaven,

50:36.430 --> 50:39.789
we've enjoyed 3,000 years of peace.

50:40.741 --> 50:44.208
Since Sun Wukong embodies
her Crystal Essence,

50:45.833 --> 50:48.440
we should train him well.

50:48.688 --> 50:51.612
Puti, give him another chance.

50:57.632 --> 51:00.319
Brother Bull, have a peach.

51:01.286 --> 51:02.739
Thank you.

51:02.974 --> 51:05.080
I've heard of your exploits.

51:05.095 --> 51:08.419
You wrecked the East Sea Palace
and stole the sacred weapons.

51:08.472 --> 51:11.011
You're as powerful as Heaven,
but your title,

51:11.022 --> 51:13.801
'Handsome Monkey King',
doesn't do you justice.

51:13.841 --> 51:16.369
You should change it
to something flashier.

51:17.431 --> 51:18.919
What do you suggest?

51:18.953 --> 51:21.810
Your powers are as great
as Heaven's...

51:22.697 --> 51:24.531
So, let's call you...

51:24.551 --> 51:27.033
the Great Sage Equal To Heaven.

51:27.659 --> 51:32.607
"Great Sage Equal To Heaven."

51:33.633 --> 51:36.125
Great name! Great name!

51:36.920 --> 51:40.247
Kinsmen, I'm no longer
Handsome Monkey King!

51:40.279 --> 51:42.556
Call me,
Great Sage Equal To Heaven.

51:42.645 --> 51:44.862
Great Sage Equal To Heaven!

51:44.932 --> 51:46.507
You are a virtuous fellow!

51:46.535 --> 51:49.517
You can blow out fires and
you're great at picking names!

51:49.571 --> 51:51.502
- Let's be friends.
- Great Sage...

51:51.538 --> 51:53.364
You are born of the crystal,

51:53.411 --> 51:55.768
with powers as great as Heaven's.

51:55.837 --> 51:58.496
It's beneath you to be
king of this mountain.

51:58.521 --> 51:59.888
But, I'm comfortable here.

51:59.919 --> 52:01.214
I don't want to go anywhere else.

52:01.238 --> 52:04.366
But you're destined to be
an Immortal.

52:04.557 --> 52:05.779
Uh...

52:05.813 --> 52:09.697
Is Heaven as nice as Huaguo Shan
and Water Curtain Cave?

52:09.737 --> 52:12.817
I heard, Heaven's Court
is a big, beautiful place.

52:12.916 --> 52:15.671
- Tell me all about it.
- There are 33 levels of Heaven.

52:15.708 --> 52:19.206
Some Immortals can even
resurrect the dead.

52:28.653 --> 52:30.855
<i>"Resurrect the Dead".</i>

52:31.732 --> 52:33.372
<i>I'll go to Heaven,</i>

52:33.421 --> 52:36.341
<i>and learn to resurrect the dead.</i>

52:39.899 --> 52:41.641
<i>Who's the top guy in Heaven?</i>

52:41.700 --> 52:43.768
<i>The Jade Emperor.</i>

52:44.625 --> 52:46.390
<i>Where are you going?</i>

52:46.802 --> 52:48.348
<i>I'm off to Heaven,</i>

52:48.403 --> 52:50.864
<i>to learn how to
resurrect the dead.</i>

52:52.674 --> 52:54.135
Hey!

52:55.504 --> 52:57.346
This is where we first met.

52:57.690 --> 52:59.206
Wait here for me.

52:59.271 --> 53:00.891
Be back soon!

53:00.945 --> 53:04.258
Don't make me wait
another hundred years!

53:04.397 --> 53:06.911
When I get back, I'll teach you.

53:15.750 --> 53:18.315
Even though this monkey
has innate power

53:18.340 --> 53:20.151
and was trained by an Immortal,

53:20.206 --> 53:23.254
he still lacks the power
to destroy the South Gate.

53:23.289 --> 53:25.523
What if he takes the elixir?

53:26.233 --> 53:28.045
The Jade Emperor's elixir?

53:28.078 --> 53:30.107
It multiplies power
a hundredfold.

53:30.137 --> 53:33.513
But, a monkey with such power...
How would you control it?

53:33.553 --> 53:35.497
I'll set him on a rampage.

53:35.661 --> 53:37.482
I'll instigate his rage.

53:37.939 --> 53:40.118
As for Heaven...

53:41.650 --> 53:44.249
you just take care of your end.

53:59.709 --> 54:02.043
This is the
South Gate of Heaven.

54:02.066 --> 54:03.746
Monkey Demons not allowed!

54:03.784 --> 54:07.057
I have two eyes and you have three,
yet YOU call ME a demon.

54:07.093 --> 54:09.771
- What are you, then?
- I'm the God Erlang.

54:09.857 --> 54:11.716
Guardian of Heaven.

54:11.837 --> 54:15.430
Demons are foridden entry,
on pain of being incinerated.

54:15.477 --> 54:18.512
I don't care who you are.
I'm from Huaguo Shan...

54:18.566 --> 54:21.897
The Great Sage Equal
To Heaven, Sun Wukong!

54:25.654 --> 54:28.380
By the way
your third eye is cockeyed.

54:28.677 --> 54:30.764
What are you looking at?

54:31.975 --> 54:34.754
<i>I have the thunder
of three generations.</i>

54:34.822 --> 54:37.611
<i>Today I'll break through
the South Gate.</i>

54:38.903 --> 54:40.367
Oh!

54:41.016 --> 54:43.905
If you can pass,
I won't stop you.

54:45.117 --> 54:48.177
But, you'll end up,
burned to ashes,

54:48.413 --> 54:50.798
because you're a Demon.

54:50.934 --> 54:54.165
Hah! I'm Sun Wukong.
Just watch me.

55:25.672 --> 55:27.117
I did it.

55:27.761 --> 55:29.360
I got in!

56:19.822 --> 56:22.822
Your friend looks like
he's had it.

56:27.223 --> 56:29.037
With all this stuff on his back,

56:29.086 --> 56:30.991
no wonder he's knackered!

56:31.222 --> 56:33.348
Giddap! You're free!

56:34.744 --> 56:36.674
You're free. Go run around.

56:36.765 --> 56:39.974
That's odd. All the time
I've had this Dragon Horse,

56:40.007 --> 56:42.593
he never let anyone
touch him, but me.

56:42.686 --> 56:44.340
You're the first.

56:45.164 --> 56:46.660
Where's the Jade Emperor?

56:46.700 --> 56:48.786
- "We" are here.
- Which one of us?

56:48.827 --> 56:50.351
Me.

56:51.641 --> 56:53.664
You're the Jade Emperor?

56:54.718 --> 56:56.906
And you are Sun Wukong.

56:59.002 --> 57:00.824
Yes "We" are.

57:04.771 --> 57:06.656
Forgive him Your Majesty.

57:08.569 --> 57:10.730
- Master?!...
- Your Majesty.

57:10.873 --> 57:13.457
Sun Wukong lost his way
and ended up in Heaven.

57:13.502 --> 57:15.286
I hope you'll forgive him.

57:15.393 --> 57:17.129
Wukong, get over here!

57:17.160 --> 57:19.285
Wukong.

57:20.397 --> 57:21.964
Sisters?

57:22.383 --> 57:24.591
Long time no see,
you're both looking great.

57:24.604 --> 57:26.568
Wukong, what lovely armour
you have!

57:26.612 --> 57:28.072
- Really?
- Yes.

57:28.140 --> 57:30.438
It's borrowed.
I'll have to return it.

57:32.093 --> 57:34.953
- Sister, look at you!...
- How rude!

57:34.959 --> 57:38.487
Yang *Jian, don't be such a
stick-in-the-mud. (Erlang)

57:42.680 --> 57:45.445
I understand the joy
of seeing old friends.

57:45.805 --> 57:48.454
Su Wukong,
why are you looking for me?

57:48.624 --> 57:50.809
I want to learn to
resurrect the dead.

57:50.958 --> 57:52.655
Why do you want to learn?

57:52.720 --> 57:53.990
If I could resurrect the dead

57:54.015 --> 57:57.054
I wouldn't have to see my
monkeys die, one by one.

57:57.162 --> 57:58.937
Emperor, teach me.

57:59.140 --> 58:02.023
The road to immortality
isn't as easy as you think.

58:02.070 --> 58:05.318
It's a long process of experience.

58:05.888 --> 58:08.707
Immortality depends on you,

58:09.069 --> 58:12.579
when you understand the true
meaning of life and death.

58:12.599 --> 58:15.192
One day, it'll all be clear.

58:16.278 --> 58:18.021
Come. Look.

58:18.405 --> 58:21.693
This little Dragon Horse
is extrmely happy, today.

58:22.986 --> 58:25.672
It seems you understand
its feelings.

58:25.927 --> 58:28.196
I'll appoint you
Protector of Horses.

58:28.557 --> 58:32.010
All of Heaven's Horses
will be in your care.

58:33.464 --> 58:35.932
- "We" appreciate you.
- Why's that?

58:36.017 --> 58:38.237
Because you appreciate "us".

58:46.508 --> 58:50.367
<i>The Imperal Protector of Horses trains
them to be Heaven's Honor Guard.</i>

58:50.407 --> 58:53.195
<i>And to escort the Jade Emperor
wherever he goes.</i>

58:55.719 --> 58:57.919
<i>Every horse must be
carefully groomed,</i>

58:57.949 --> 59:00.784
<i>as well as modest, polite
and obedient.</i>

59:14.043 --> 59:15.575
Hi, everybody!

59:16.427 --> 59:18.258
From now on, I'm your boss.

59:18.324 --> 59:20.297
My name is Sun Wukong.

59:59.782 --> 01:00:02.320
Hey! You like this?

01:00:06.116 --> 01:00:08.024
Pretty impressive, huh?

01:00:17.834 --> 01:00:20.138
- Gotta go pee.
<i>- You can't.</i>

01:00:20.271 --> 01:00:23.483
<i>Peeing is allowed only
at dawn and sunset.</i>

01:00:24.644 --> 01:00:26.910
- Is it okay to eat?
<i>- No it's not.</i>

01:00:27.089 --> 01:00:30.621
<i>Eating is allowed only in early
morning and early afternoon.</i>

01:00:32.577 --> 01:00:34.910
- Is drinking water allowed?
- <i>No it's not.</i>

01:00:34.949 --> 01:00:37.615
<i>Drinking is only allowed
at 2:am and at noon.</i>

01:00:37.654 --> 01:00:40.082
Whaaa...?!
Not even water is allowed?

01:00:40.107 --> 01:00:41.293
Huh?

01:00:41.337 --> 01:00:43.213
Heaven, is the holy shrine

01:00:43.238 --> 01:00:45.124
that controls the Three Realms.

01:00:45.686 --> 01:00:47.460
Kneel. Kneel.

01:00:47.836 --> 01:00:51.023
In Heaven, one must observe
strict rules.

01:00:55.894 --> 01:01:00.604
When you see anyone in silver robes
and gold armour, you should kneel.

01:01:00.667 --> 01:01:02.331
You're still not kneeling.

01:01:02.405 --> 01:01:04.342
I'm equal to ALL of Heaven.

01:01:04.367 --> 01:01:07.032
Why would I kneel
before you, three-eyes, huh?

01:01:07.221 --> 01:01:09.219
Once a beast, always a beast.

01:01:09.308 --> 01:01:11.532
You know nothing of rules.

01:01:19.391 --> 01:01:20.837
Stop!

01:01:26.471 --> 01:01:28.830
Brutes need to learn discipline!

01:01:39.367 --> 01:01:40.998
Did that hurt?

01:01:41.703 --> 01:01:43.372
Of course it hurt.

01:01:43.639 --> 01:01:45.356
I'm Protector of Horses.

01:01:45.574 --> 01:01:47.994
In here, what I say goes!

01:01:48.728 --> 01:01:50.265
Everybody listen.

01:01:50.311 --> 01:01:52.384
Go, you're all free.

01:01:55.322 --> 01:01:57.395
<i>Come back! Come back!</i>

01:02:08.746 --> 01:02:10.807
Call out the Heavenly army.

01:03:05.812 --> 01:03:09.379
<i>These peaches bloom for 6,000 years
and bear fruit for 6,000 years.</i>

01:03:09.404 --> 01:03:11.787
<i>These ones bloom and yield
for 9,000 years.</i>

01:03:11.824 --> 01:03:13.822
<i>Can I have a 9,000 year peach?</i>

01:03:13.885 --> 01:03:17.221
<i>Sure, they're reserved
for privileged Immortals.</i>

01:03:17.306 --> 01:03:20.734
<i>- Where is he?
- Search over there! - Yes sir!</i>

01:04:00.946 --> 01:04:02.997
Hey, what's up with
those Peaches?

01:04:03.036 --> 01:04:04.339
Where?

01:04:04.479 --> 01:04:06.018
There, look.

01:04:13.302 --> 01:04:15.014
Let's go see.

01:04:18.078 --> 01:04:21.601
Horse Keeper, how dare you eat
the Peaches of Immortality?

01:04:21.646 --> 01:04:24.279
So, I ate a peach,
what's the big deal?

01:04:24.301 --> 01:04:26.509
Only privileged Immortals
may taste the peaches,

01:04:26.534 --> 01:04:27.816
and by invitation, only.

01:04:27.844 --> 01:04:30.330
The Emperor appointed me,
Protector of Horses.

01:04:30.377 --> 01:04:32.419
So what if I eat the odd peach?

01:04:32.497 --> 01:04:35.231
<i>Horse Keepers don't rate.
Who invited you?</i>

01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:37.497
Um... What do you mean "rate"?

01:04:37.530 --> 01:04:41.079
We rank low, YOU're even lower.
<i>So, you don't "rate".</i>

01:04:41.099 --> 01:04:43.338
<i>You may be Immortal
but you don't rate.</i>

01:04:43.387 --> 01:04:46.683
They'd never share with
a petty official. - <i>Shame on you.</i>

01:04:46.739 --> 01:04:49.450
<i>Without Godly merit, yet
you eat Immortal Peaches!</i>

01:04:49.491 --> 01:04:52.085
STOP THIS RACKET!!

01:05:32.359 --> 01:05:33.882
Release.

01:05:50.692 --> 01:05:52.581
Viceroy Erlang.

01:05:54.351 --> 01:05:55.833
You've been injured.

01:05:56.053 --> 01:05:58.427
Did that Demon Monkey
do this to you?

01:05:58.504 --> 01:06:01.786
Yes. He even stole the
Peaches of Immortality.

01:06:09.409 --> 01:06:11.057
Report this to the Emperor.

01:06:11.087 --> 01:06:14.559
Tell him how that monkey
damaged the peach orchard.

01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:18.043
And viciously injured you.

01:06:18.478 --> 01:06:19.903
All right.

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:31.285
I'll go right away.

01:06:39.866 --> 01:06:41.434
Poke!

01:06:41.505 --> 01:06:44.526
I've wanted to poke your
eyes for a long time.

01:06:45.049 --> 01:06:46.506
Hey, relax!

01:06:55.353 --> 01:06:56.885
What effrontery!

01:06:57.087 --> 01:06:58.849
You dare attack me?

01:06:58.904 --> 01:07:00.474
Please forgive me, Majesty.

01:07:00.499 --> 01:07:02.300
The Demon Monkey stole
some Immortal Peaches.

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.216
He provoked me and
I went after him.

01:07:04.241 --> 01:07:07.779
For the sake of Heaven, I will
crush Monsters and conquer Demons.

01:07:07.825 --> 01:07:09.935
We have so many
Peaches in Heaven.

01:07:10.119 --> 01:07:11.698
Who are they for?

01:07:11.814 --> 01:07:14.620
Aren't they reserved for
privileged Immortals?

01:07:14.869 --> 01:07:16.698
All those peaches?

01:07:17.041 --> 01:07:19.261
How can they eat them all?

01:07:19.531 --> 01:07:21.727
Give him some, instead.

01:07:28.879 --> 01:07:32.411
I said, give him some
Peaches of Immortality!

01:07:32.451 --> 01:07:33.939
All right?

01:07:34.556 --> 01:07:36.151
All right?

01:07:36.782 --> 01:07:38.349
Impudent monkey!

01:07:38.374 --> 01:07:41.083
How dare you impersonate
the Emperor?

01:07:41.559 --> 01:07:45.028
Don't get carried away, or you'll
never see things as they are.

01:08:04.678 --> 01:08:06.145
<i>Your Majesty,</i>

01:08:06.184 --> 01:08:09.630
<i>the whole Demon Clan is ready
to sacrifice their souls</i>

01:08:09.663 --> 01:08:12.135
<i>to be forged into a mighty
Demonic Axe,</i>

01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:14.950
<i>embued with enough power
of hate and rancor</i>

01:08:14.984 --> 01:08:16.942
<i>to destroy Heaven and Earth.</i>

01:08:16.990 --> 01:08:20.615
<i>Majesty, this time,
you'll surely destroy the Gods.</i>

01:08:21.707 --> 01:08:23.671
What are you doing?

01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:37.890
You shouldn't have come here.

01:08:49.319 --> 01:08:51.192
You once promised me

01:08:51.313 --> 01:08:54.005
you'd abandon your feud
against the Gods.

01:08:54.037 --> 01:08:56.529
And never again,
set foot in Heaven.

01:09:06.537 --> 01:09:08.078
That year...

01:09:09.995 --> 01:09:12.921
I left Heaven and followed you, here.

01:09:13.457 --> 01:09:17.299
I broke the law forbidding us
to love Demons, for you.

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.332
Why can't you just drop it?

01:09:21.058 --> 01:09:23.377
Because of our ancestral Demon code.

01:09:23.402 --> 01:09:25.618
Battle glory, or wife and child.

01:09:25.635 --> 01:09:27.798
- Pick one.
- I want both.

01:09:35.551 --> 01:09:37.212
Continue!

01:09:43.357 --> 01:09:44.662
Don't worry.

01:09:44.707 --> 01:09:47.325
I'll definitely bring you
back to Heaven.

01:09:47.839 --> 01:09:50.001
We'll have a happy life
together.

01:09:50.537 --> 01:09:54.644
<i>The Demon Battleaxe is cast.
Our blood is sacrificed against Heaven.</i>

01:09:54.863 --> 01:09:57.853
<i>The Demon Clan shall rise again!</i>

01:11:10.355 --> 01:11:13.705
What's with the big furnace, huh?

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:18.007
Are you the celebrated
Sun Wukong?

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.493
Err... "We" are.

01:11:22.003 --> 01:11:25.568
Here, we distill the Heavenly Elixir

01:11:42.309 --> 01:11:44.108
Immortality pills?

01:11:44.197 --> 01:11:46.875
These pills greatly increase
the Immortals' powers.

01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:50.394
The equivalent of 30,000 years
of spiritual cultivation.

01:11:50.628 --> 01:11:52.764

Immortality Peaches.

01:14:39.551 --> 01:14:42.277
And now, the Emperor's
Immortality Pills?!

01:14:42.330 --> 01:14:44.142
Wukong, obey.

01:14:44.227 --> 01:14:47.382
Accept your punishment,

I taught him badly.
Forgive his sin, Emperor.

01:20:43.165 --> 01:20:44.617
Don't blame yourself.

01:20:44.642 --> 01:20:46.822
It's his decision to leave.

01:20:46.997 --> 01:20:48.925
None of us can stop him.

01:20:49.335 --> 01:20:51.144
Just let him go.

You may have trespassed
against Heaven, but,

01:25:13.577 --> 01:25:16.157
it's criminal to take it out
on your monkey brothers.

01:25:16.182 --> 01:25:17.736
Mighty Heaven...

Huaguo Shan will become
another Flame Mountain.

It seems, war is inevitable.

You burned Huaguo Shan, first,

Yet the lamp flame flickers endlessly,
