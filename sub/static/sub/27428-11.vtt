<i>Lance Armstrong,

00:04.844 --> 00:07.514
<i>and yours truly, Zoey Johnson.</i>

00:07.548 --> 00:10.317
<i>What did all of us
perfectly coiffed human beings</i>

00:10.350 --> 00:13.463
<i>have in common besides
our unprecedented good looks</i>

00:13.488 --> 00:14.988
<i>and killer smiles?</i>

00:15.022 --> 00:16.723
<i>We were all cheaters.</i>

00:18.225 --> 00:20.161
<i>And as with most cheaters,</i>

00:20.194 --> 00:22.329
<i>there comes a time when we all must face</i>

00:22.362 --> 00:24.699
<i>the consequences of our actions...</i>

00:26.232 --> 00:27.434
<i>And me?</i>

00:27.467 --> 00:28.836
<i>Well, my consequences</i>

00:28.869 --> 00:30.271
<i>had yet to be revealed,</i>

00:30.303 --> 00:32.272
<i>but in less than 24 hours,</i>

00:32.305 --> 00:34.040
<i>I would learn what big red stamp</i>

00:34.074 --> 00:35.842
<i>would be slapped across my image</i>

00:35.875 --> 00:38.946
<i>after cheating on my Chemistry final.</i>

00:38.979 --> 00:40.247
I'm so sorry.

00:40.280 --> 00:42.516
Would you mind grabbing it for me?

00:47.321 --> 00:49.857
<i>But you know what? It was gonna be okay.</i>

00:49.890 --> 00:51.893
<i>I mean, it's not like I'm facing...</i>

00:54.394 --> 00:56.863
Expulsion? Holy sh...

00:56.897 --> 00:58.199
No.

00:58.232 --> 01:01.601
<i>And to make matters worse,
it was Parents' Weekend.</i>

01:01.635 --> 01:04.370
<i>And my dad, who was totally clueless,</i>

01:04.404 --> 01:06.874
<i>wouldn't stop calling
to plan our itinerary.</i>

01:06.906 --> 01:09.043
No.

01:11.912 --> 01:16.216

I'm screwed. Like,
I may as well pack my bags,

01:53.119 --> 01:54.621
look for a single in Pacoima,

01:54.654 --> 01:57.424
and a full-time job at,
like, Pinkberry-type screwed.

01:57.457 --> 01:58.859
Honey, you're not <i> that</i> screwed.

01:58.892 --> 02:00.828
She's also <i> not</i> getting
hired at Pinkberry.

02:00.860 --> 02:03.097
Do you know how hard it is
to get a job there?

02:03.130 --> 02:05.673
Our whole family tried to work
there for three straight years.

02:05.698 --> 02:07.167
Bitch thinks she can just walk in

02:07.201 --> 02:09.203
- and be a fro-yo ambassador.
- No.

02:09.235 --> 02:11.005
- What?
- Anyways, I meet with the board

02:11.037 --> 02:12.939
in less than 24 hours.

02:12.972 --> 02:14.340
I mean, I could be gone.

02:14.374 --> 02:16.142
- Great.
- Oh.

02:16.143 --> 02:18.645
It's your dad... Throwing up the "W."

02:19.312 --> 02:20.714
No.

02:24.717 --> 02:28.488
If there's anyone who deserves
to be shushed, it's that man.

02:28.522 --> 02:30.558
Cold. She just shushed her own father.

02:30.590 --> 02:33.126
He won't stop harassing me
about Parents' Weekend.

02:33.160 --> 02:35.496
So shouldn't you just answer
and tell him not to come?

02:35.529 --> 02:37.163
Yes, Sky, I <i> should.</i>

02:37.197 --> 02:38.399
Tone.

02:38.431 --> 02:39.732
Sorry.

02:39.766 --> 02:41.401
Um, that's a good idea.

02:41.435 --> 02:44.338
I should, but I can't,
because he's gonna hear my voice

02:44.370 --> 02:46.239
and immediately know
that something's wrong,

02:46.273 --> 02:48.309
and then I will be extra screwed.

02:48.341 --> 02:50.344
I just have to pull myself
together first.

02:50.376 --> 02:51.978
So, on that, I need a drink.

02:52.012 --> 02:54.181
- We all need drinks.
- Yeah.

02:54.214 --> 02:55.983
You know, Zo, you actually
might want to tell him

02:56.016 --> 02:58.151
not to come this weekend
just for his own personal safety

02:58.185 --> 03:00.187
because it's about to go down.

03:00.220 --> 03:01.889
What are you talking about?

03:01.922 --> 03:03.556
All right, you guys know
how I've been going

03:03.590 --> 03:06.160
to Professor Hewson for some
guidance and mentoring?

03:06.192 --> 03:07.103
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

03:07.135 --> 03:08.398
Okay, so, thanks to her,

03:08.423 --> 03:11.665
I think I'm finally ready
to tell my parents

03:11.697 --> 03:13.166
that I'm bi this weekend.

03:13.199 --> 03:15.335
- Oh, my goodness.
- That... That's huge.

03:15.369 --> 03:17.071
And they probably
won't take it that hard

03:17.103 --> 03:18.505
- 'cause you're only kinda gay.
- Mm-hmm.

03:18.537 --> 03:21.674
Okay, not how that works.

03:21.708 --> 03:23.710
- We're drinking?
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

03:33.320 --> 03:35.589
Thank you.

03:38.424 --> 03:43.429
To Nomi's big moment...
and to my last day at Cal U.

03:43.463 --> 03:44.965
- What?
- Oh, don't say that.

03:44.997 --> 03:47.201
Honestly, you are all the best friends

03:47.233 --> 03:49.202
I could've ever asked for.

03:49.235 --> 03:50.471
Like you.

03:50.504 --> 03:52.372
I never thought that a woman

03:52.405 --> 03:56.743
with such a cynical attitude
would be the Clyde to my Bonnie.

03:57.911 --> 04:02.282
Jazz and Sky, y'all are my sisters,

04:02.316 --> 04:04.385
and just like my real sister,

04:04.417 --> 04:10.657
you are cute and independent
and, um... really scary.

04:10.691 --> 04:12.326
- Aww.
- Aww.

04:12.359 --> 04:14.128
And you.

04:14.160 --> 04:15.963
We have come so far.

04:15.996 --> 04:18.265
You know, you're my literal
"ride or die."

04:18.297 --> 04:20.434
I'd trust you with my life.

04:22.302 --> 04:24.138
Bring it in. Come on.

04:24.170 --> 04:26.139
Bring it in.

04:26.172 --> 04:28.074
That's so sweet.

04:28.107 --> 04:31.682
All right, enough with, like, the
"Army Wives" monologue. Let's...

04:31.707 --> 04:33.414
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:33.446 --> 04:34.681
Mm.

04:34.715 --> 04:37.318
And, look, you're not getting
kicked out anyway.

04:37.350 --> 04:38.651
All you have to do is go in there

04:38.684 --> 04:40.620
and answer every single
question the same...

04:40.653 --> 04:42.588
"I do not recall."

04:42.621 --> 04:45.191
It worked for, um, Bill Clinton,
Jeff Sessions...

04:45.225 --> 04:46.460
- Justin Bieber.
- Lil Wayne.

04:46.492 --> 04:48.127
Those hot-ass Menendez brothers.

04:48.160 --> 04:49.963
- Hmm?
- Hmm?

04:49.996 --> 04:51.298
- What?
- Oh.

04:51.330 --> 04:52.333
You know what? All right.

04:52.366 --> 04:55.706
I think I am ready to call my dad.

04:55.731 --> 04:57.526
- You got it.
- Yeah, it'll be fine.

04:57.551 --> 04:59.439
- Yeah, just breathe.
- Hey, Dad.

04:59.472 --> 05:02.943
- She's screwed.
- Mm-hmm.

05:02.975 --> 05:05.446
No. No, no, no, no.

05:05.479 --> 05:07.448
Nothing is wrong, Dad. I promise.

05:07.480 --> 05:11.951
It's just that, I mean, Parents'
Weekend feels a bit triggering.

05:11.984 --> 05:14.153
See? The way that you're crying
right now,

05:14.186 --> 05:17.090
that's the way I'm crying...

05:17.114 --> 05:18.324
on the inside.

05:18.325 --> 05:21.562
So how about we just skip
the weekend of heartache

05:21.595 --> 05:24.530
and remember each other how we are?

05:24.564 --> 05:27.234
You know what? You'll get there.
Love you, Dad. Bye.

05:28.667 --> 05:31.004
First I cheated on my Chem final,

05:31.037 --> 05:33.741
and now I'm lying to my emo-ass dad.

05:33.773 --> 05:35.408
Who am I?

05:37.511 --> 05:39.713
Who are you?

05:43.116 --> 05:46.153
Great. Everybody's out here
enjoying Parents' Weekend,

05:46.186 --> 05:48.155
and we're sitting here
abandoned like a car

05:48.188 --> 05:49.523
on Cousin Speedy's front lawn.

05:49.556 --> 05:51.725
Y-Your pops isn't coming?
Dude comes to everything.

05:51.758 --> 05:54.495
Not since Jazz's deep dive
into Thot-land on the 'gram

05:54.528 --> 05:56.662
and I've been disowned by association.

05:56.696 --> 05:59.366
Relax. Daddy and I will
resolve our issues eventually.

05:59.398 --> 06:01.768
Eh, spoken like a true future stripper.

06:01.802 --> 06:03.003
Guys, if it's any consolation,

06:03.035 --> 06:05.172
Parents' Weekend
is totally overrated, okay?

06:05.205 --> 06:06.407
My parents never come.

06:06.439 --> 06:08.374
You think that's because
maybe they don't love you?

06:08.407 --> 06:10.410
What? No. Correction.
My parents adore me.

06:10.443 --> 06:13.112
It's just, freshman year, they
had this little Ensenada cruise

06:13.145 --> 06:14.715
they booked the day I left home.

06:14.748 --> 06:17.017
Then sophomore year,
the family dog got sick.

06:17.049 --> 06:18.585
You know Steve.
Gotta take care of Steve.

06:18.617 --> 06:20.019
You know Steve. You've seen pictures.

06:20.052 --> 06:23.023
Um, and then this year, they, uh...

06:23.056 --> 06:26.092
you know... pbht...

06:26.126 --> 06:27.460
I got to make a quick call.

06:27.494 --> 06:29.797
Okay. Do you.

06:29.830 --> 06:31.532
Your parents abandon you, too?

06:31.564 --> 06:33.366
Nah. I didn't even tell them about it.

06:33.400 --> 06:35.135
Parents' Weekend is big business for me.

06:35.167 --> 06:36.369
Lots of stressed-out students

06:36.403 --> 06:39.873
and a lot of dads
with erectile dysfunction.

06:39.905 --> 06:41.407
Oh, my God!

06:41.441 --> 06:42.810
What did Tyrese do now?

06:42.842 --> 06:46.646
No! Somebody hacked my IG account!

06:56.689 --> 06:59.059
Before we begin, I feel it's only right

06:59.092 --> 07:02.395
that I recuse myself from this matter.

07:02.429 --> 07:05.399
The defendant and I
are actually blood relatives

07:05.431 --> 07:08.234
who share the same exact genetic makeup.

07:08.268 --> 07:11.004
And as such, I find it impossible for me

07:11.037 --> 07:13.674
to remain impartial in this matter.

07:13.706 --> 07:15.608
Really?

07:15.641 --> 07:18.077
The one time this moron
could actually help me,

07:18.111 --> 07:19.279
and he's bouncing.

07:26.119 --> 07:28.088
Apologies for my attire.

07:28.121 --> 07:30.023
Me and some buddies took
an impromptu trip

07:30.056 --> 07:32.092
down to Lake Havasu last night,

07:32.124 --> 07:37.830
where my boy Deante took
a lighter to my work pants.

07:37.864 --> 07:41.669
Now... if you'll recuse me.

07:42.903 --> 07:44.705
You did this, Laura.

07:44.737 --> 07:46.607
You voted him dean.

07:46.640 --> 07:48.509
You know, actually, on second thought,

07:48.542 --> 07:51.678
he should just leave
and never, ever come back.

07:51.710 --> 07:54.114
Ms. Johnson,

07:54.146 --> 07:57.350
you're being accused of cheating
on your final exam.

07:57.383 --> 07:59.785
<i>As I sat there watching the board,</i>

07:59.818 --> 08:02.289
<i>all I could see were the faces...</i>

08:02.321 --> 08:04.991
<i>the faces of those who I knew
I'd disappoint</i>

08:05.025 --> 08:06.493
<i>if I couldn't fix this.</i>

08:06.525 --> 08:08.328
What the [bleep] she doing?

08:12.398 --> 08:15.668
<i>And the faces of the people
I would miss if I got expelled.</i>

08:20.172 --> 08:23.809
<i>And then, suddenly,
I remembered Nomi's advice.</i>

08:23.842 --> 08:26.379
Remember, "I do not recall."

08:26.412 --> 08:28.648
"I do not recall."

08:28.681 --> 08:30.717
"I do not recall."

08:32.851 --> 08:35.855
Is there anything you would
like to say on your behalf?

08:37.556 --> 08:39.559
Ms. Johnson?

08:39.592 --> 08:40.861
Ms. Johnson?

08:40.893 --> 08:43.763
Uh... mm-hmm?

08:43.797 --> 08:46.367
Is there anything you'd like
to say on your behalf?

08:47.300 --> 08:49.637
I do not re...

08:51.204 --> 08:53.040
There isn't.

08:54.874 --> 08:56.944
I-I cheated.

08:59.707 --> 09:03.215
<i>So that afternoon, I discovered
what my consequence was</i>

09:03.240 --> 09:06.686
<i>after all, and it wasn't
facing that ethics board.</i>

09:06.720 --> 09:09.022
<i>It was facing myself.</i>

09:09.055 --> 09:13.226
<i>And the truth was, I didn't
like the person I was becoming.</i>

09:13.258 --> 09:14.894
- Ms. Johnson?
- Yeah?

09:14.927 --> 09:17.029
- We're ready for you.
- Okay.

09:21.267 --> 09:24.371
Wow. This really is nice.

09:24.403 --> 09:27.206
Sure. It's no Yale, but at least
it's just as expensive.

09:27.239 --> 09:28.709
Mm-hmm.

09:28.742 --> 09:32.312
Ooh, there are so many
attractive young men here...

09:32.345 --> 09:33.714
- Mom.
- Calm down, Sue.

09:33.747 --> 09:34.982
We've talked about this at counseling.

09:35.014 --> 09:36.282
Fine.

09:36.316 --> 09:39.619
So... have you met anyone special?

09:41.354 --> 09:43.389
Actually, um, I have.

09:43.422 --> 09:45.558
Please tell me he's Jewish.

09:53.499 --> 09:56.235
I don't know what she is, Mom.

10:04.844 --> 10:07.580
I cannot believe this.
All my posts are gone.

10:07.614 --> 10:09.016
I can't even sign in.

10:09.048 --> 10:10.650
Here, give me the phone.
I've dealt with this before.

10:10.683 --> 10:12.151
The haters are constantly hacking V-dig.

10:12.185 --> 10:15.081
- What's your password?
- eatthebootylikegroceries_1.

10:15.106 --> 10:16.139
What?

10:16.164 --> 10:17.824
It gets weird when she's
on the phone with the bank

10:17.856 --> 10:18.941
and has to verify.

10:18.966 --> 10:20.259
You know what else is weird
now that I think of it?

10:20.292 --> 10:22.294
My parents didn't even help me
move into college.

10:22.327 --> 10:25.331
Like, no care packages,
no Costco runs, nothing...

10:25.364 --> 10:26.499
You.

10:26.532 --> 10:28.768
It was probably
his hatin' ass who did it.

10:28.802 --> 10:30.970
- Excuse me?
- Her Instagram page.

10:31.004 --> 10:32.538
Somebody hacked it.

10:32.571 --> 10:34.173
I ain't looked at your ratchet-ass page

10:34.206 --> 10:35.441
since we broke up.

10:35.475 --> 10:36.777
I don't even follow you no more.

10:36.810 --> 10:39.212
You unfollowed me?

10:39.244 --> 10:41.447
I understand how you feel,
'cause my parents unfollowed me

10:41.480 --> 10:42.948
in real life, so...

10:42.981 --> 10:44.684
Damn it.

10:44.718 --> 10:47.554
Wow. You have taken pettiness
to a whole other level.

10:47.586 --> 10:51.157
I did not hack you, but whoever
did did you a favor

10:51.191 --> 10:53.660
- by taking down them thirsty-ass posts.
- You see right there?

10:53.692 --> 10:54.960
That's the type of pettiness

10:54.994 --> 10:56.196
that really makes me think you did it.

10:56.229 --> 10:57.797
Yo, I said I didn't do it.

10:57.830 --> 10:59.666
But now you're making me
feel like I should've.

10:59.699 --> 11:00.734
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

11:00.767 --> 11:02.069
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

11:02.101 --> 11:03.669
- I did not hack your page.
- Yes, you did.

11:03.702 --> 11:07.707
Why you lying?

11:07.740 --> 11:10.309
- Hey.
- Hey, quick question.

11:10.343 --> 11:12.345
Um, have your parents come
to every Parents' Weekend?

11:12.378 --> 11:14.480
It's not like a-a thing, is it?

11:14.513 --> 11:15.981
<i>Yeah, my parents come to everything.</i>

11:16.014 --> 11:18.250
<i>Ugh, my mother brought me enough lechón</i>

11:18.283 --> 11:19.485
<i>to feed me for a month.</i>

11:19.518 --> 11:21.421
<i>They love me.</i>

11:21.454 --> 11:23.223
Right, right.

11:23.255 --> 11:25.057
Is this what you called me about?

11:25.090 --> 11:27.661
No. Yeah, I was just calling
to ask about Zoey.

11:27.694 --> 11:29.596
<i>How'd that go?
Like, did you tell her yet?</i>

11:29.629 --> 11:31.330
Not yet.

11:31.364 --> 11:33.399
But I will do it tonight.

11:33.432 --> 11:35.167
<i>Okay, well, let me know how that goes,</i>

11:35.201 --> 11:37.903
and congratulations on your
parents loving you, too.

11:37.936 --> 11:40.239
Uh, thank you?

11:43.442 --> 11:45.778
Guess what. I did it, babe.

11:45.811 --> 11:47.847
- I beat the system.
- Nice. What happened?

11:47.880 --> 11:50.116
Life is good for both you and me.

11:50.149 --> 11:52.451
Like, okay, sure,
I'm on academic probation,

11:52.484 --> 11:54.955
and, you know, I will have
to take Chemistry again,

11:54.988 --> 11:56.022
but you know what?

11:56.055 --> 11:57.624
I am still a Cal U Titan.

11:57.657 --> 11:59.626
Congrats. Okay, Titan.

12:00.994 --> 12:03.263
That is probably Postmates

12:03.296 --> 12:06.099
because I ordered us
some celebratory pho.

12:06.132 --> 12:07.400
Coming, coming, coming.

12:07.432 --> 12:10.202
Hey. Hey, hey.

12:10.235 --> 12:13.472
You want to tell me
what the hell is going on?

12:13.505 --> 12:15.608
What the pho...

12:18.945 --> 12:20.946
Why after Charlie called me

12:20.979 --> 12:22.883
to tell me about his Lake Havasu trip

12:22.916 --> 12:26.619
did he also tell me that you are
on academic probation?!

12:26.653 --> 12:28.654
Wow. This how the young
college kids living these days?

12:28.687 --> 12:30.389
- Damn.
- What the hell?

12:30.422 --> 12:33.393
Make me want to re-enroll,
pull a black Rodney Dangerfield.

12:33.426 --> 12:34.666
Where do you keep your ice?

12:34.698 --> 12:37.136
Right down there, and, Dad,
honestly everything is fine.

12:37.162 --> 12:38.565
They put me on academic probation

12:38.598 --> 12:40.066
instead of expelling me
because I came clean

12:40.099 --> 12:41.568
and told them I was cheating
on my Chem final...

12:41.600 --> 12:43.769
What?

12:43.802 --> 12:45.404
Holy crap.

12:45.437 --> 12:47.340
Did I just Fredo Corleone myself?

12:47.373 --> 12:50.076
Zoey, who are you? Huh?

12:50.109 --> 12:51.811
Oh, calm down, Dre.

12:51.845 --> 12:54.580
I can remember a time
when I got a call from Howard

12:54.614 --> 12:56.917
about a young, dumb freshman
who had just got caught

12:56.950 --> 12:59.585
buying a term paper from some white kid.

12:59.619 --> 13:02.589
First off, Gary grew up
in a black neighborhood,

13:02.622 --> 13:04.758
and secondly, he seemed to have a grasp

13:04.791 --> 13:06.426
of the Harlem Renaissance.

13:06.459 --> 13:08.595
Whatever it was, cheating
is a necessary life skill.

13:08.628 --> 13:11.263
I mean, how do you think most
successful people get ahead anyway?

13:11.297 --> 13:13.667
But if you're gonna cheat,
Zoey, don't get caught.

13:13.700 --> 13:14.935
- That's bush league.
- Pops.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.870
- Yeah?
- You're not helping the situation.

13:16.903 --> 13:18.271
I'm sorry, Dre.
I just don't think it's as big

13:18.303 --> 13:19.574
a "situation" as you do.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.874
Hey, baby. Are these the Postmates guys?

13:26.812 --> 13:29.448
Oh, now we got a "situation."

13:38.258 --> 13:39.893
- Hey.
- Hi.

13:39.926 --> 13:41.294
- Guess what?
- What?

13:41.326 --> 13:42.828
Came out to my parents.

13:42.861 --> 13:45.304
- Yep. Can you believe it?
- Wow.

13:45.335 --> 13:46.799
I mean, my dad thinks it's just a phase.

13:46.832 --> 13:49.335
My mom, like, keeps asking me
if I'm gonna leave school

13:49.369 --> 13:53.672
to go to Broadway, but whatever
'cause I feel, like, amazing.

13:53.705 --> 13:54.975
Thank you so much.

13:55.008 --> 13:56.843
You have no reason to thank me.

13:56.875 --> 13:59.678
I didn't even do it, by the way,
because I felt like I had to.

13:59.711 --> 14:03.249
I did it because you made me
realize that I wanted to.

14:03.282 --> 14:05.585
I mean, like, the events
that you took me to,

14:05.618 --> 14:10.156
all the talks that we had,
I mean, the connection between us.

14:14.127 --> 14:15.595
I'm happy for you, Nomi.

14:15.628 --> 14:17.229
Thanks.

14:17.263 --> 14:19.566
Would you mind if I...
if I gave you a call tomorrow?

14:19.599 --> 14:22.035
Yeah, totally. For sure.
Call me whenever you're free.

14:25.872 --> 14:28.174
Oh.

14:28.206 --> 14:31.477
Sorry. Did, I, um...
Did I interrupt something?

14:34.279 --> 14:35.681
Yeah.

14:35.715 --> 14:38.518
Hey, hey, Nomi. Nomi, come here.

14:38.551 --> 14:39.953
No, you know what? It's fine.

14:39.985 --> 14:41.854
I obviously misinterpreted
your feelings,

14:41.888 --> 14:43.389
seeing as there's another woman in there

14:43.422 --> 14:44.957
with her legs kicked up,
drinking what appears to be

14:44.990 --> 14:46.509
a very light Pinot Noir.

14:46.534 --> 14:48.361
You didn't misinterpret anything.

14:48.393 --> 14:50.562
I thought you understood
the reality of this.

14:50.595 --> 14:53.133
I understand that we're both adults.

14:53.166 --> 14:54.868
And we can do whatever we want.

14:54.901 --> 14:56.870
Absolutely. In the real world, yes.

14:56.903 --> 14:59.806
But our situation, it's not realistic.

14:59.839 --> 15:01.374
People find out, I get fired,

15:01.407 --> 15:03.677
and how am I supposed to defend myself?

15:06.345 --> 15:08.648
Uh, yeah, I don't know.

15:08.681 --> 15:10.215
I don't know.

15:10.249 --> 15:12.085
Shit.

15:12.118 --> 15:13.920
Yeah, I guess you couldn't.

15:23.830 --> 15:25.546
Back in the day when I went to college,

15:25.571 --> 15:29.068
men were not allowed in
ladies' rooms past sundown.

15:29.093 --> 15:30.362
Winters were hard.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.057
You didn't go to college, Pops.

15:32.090 --> 15:34.225
That's 'cause I was out there
risking my life in 'Nam.

15:34.259 --> 15:35.961
You also didn't go to 'Nam.

15:35.994 --> 15:37.128
Man, [bleep] you. Listen here.

15:37.161 --> 15:38.463
This young bohemian is up in here

15:38.495 --> 15:39.864
living his best life
with my granddaughter.

15:39.898 --> 15:40.902
- Mm-hmm.
- Um...

15:40.927 --> 15:42.200
Well, with all due respect,

15:42.233 --> 15:43.802
I don't live here.

15:43.835 --> 15:45.804
- I have my own spot.
- He does.

15:45.836 --> 15:48.206
And when was the last time
you slept at your "spot"?

15:48.239 --> 15:49.975
- Like, what was it, yesterday?
- Pfft. Like, September.

15:50.008 --> 15:52.744
- Yesterday, yesterday.
- Yesterday.

15:52.777 --> 15:55.146
What's that behind your ear, dawg?

15:55.178 --> 15:57.348
Is that a cigarette?

15:57.382 --> 15:58.750
Oh, pfft, nah, it's nothing.

15:58.783 --> 16:02.921
It's actually, um, a-a-a hearing aid

16:02.954 --> 16:06.925
because Luca happens
to be hearing-impaired.

16:06.957 --> 16:10.594
See, they know about your hearing...

16:10.628 --> 16:12.097
Zoey!

16:12.129 --> 16:15.332
Come on.

16:20.305 --> 16:22.340
Look at me.

16:22.373 --> 16:25.076
Who are you?

16:25.109 --> 16:28.379
- Dad, I'm so sorry about this whole...
- Stop.

16:34.451 --> 16:37.022
Your mother and I have worked hard

16:37.055 --> 16:39.357
to make sure you have
everything that you need.

16:39.389 --> 16:41.178
- I know.
- Hell, we've given you tons of stuff

16:41.202 --> 16:42.658
that you don't need.

16:42.659 --> 16:45.029
And looking around at all this,

16:45.062 --> 16:50.367
I realize... that I've made
your life too easy for you.

16:50.400 --> 16:53.771
What? I... I'm gonna get better
and do better, Dad.

16:53.805 --> 16:56.608
- You'll see. Next semester, I'll be...
- No, I won't.

16:56.640 --> 16:59.777
I've seen enough, Zoey,

16:59.811 --> 17:01.146
and I'm done.

17:04.915 --> 17:06.917
W-What does that mean?

17:08.752 --> 17:13.657
It means that if you want
to stay at Cal U, great.

17:13.690 --> 17:18.796
But this lifestyle,
I can't bankroll anymore.

17:22.433 --> 17:23.768
I'm cutting you off, Zoey.

17:33.543 --> 17:36.447
No, if you came here to accuse...

17:36.481 --> 17:39.917
I-I know who hacked my account.

17:39.950 --> 17:44.421
<i>If your nasty ass came to this
page to stalk my daughter,</i>

17:44.455 --> 17:46.758
<i>well, you in the wrong damn place.</i>

17:46.791 --> 17:50.695
<i>But if you came to inquire
about some delectable</i>

17:50.727 --> 17:54.099
<i>South Korean BBQ and collard greens,</i>

17:54.131 --> 17:56.266
<i>you exactly where you should be.</i>

17:56.300 --> 17:58.369
<i>Mmm.</i>

17:58.402 --> 17:59.437
That was your pops?

17:59.469 --> 18:02.106
- Yeah.
- Dude is wild.

18:02.139 --> 18:03.941
I like his style, though.

18:06.310 --> 18:09.280
- So...
- So... Uh, you.

18:09.312 --> 18:14.386
Uh... I'm sorry for accusing
you of hacking my page.

18:14.418 --> 18:16.687
I guess I'm sorry, too.

18:16.721 --> 18:18.957
Unfollowing you was kind of petty.

18:18.990 --> 18:21.626
Speaking of which, if you unfollowed me,

18:21.658 --> 18:24.763
how did you know my "thirsty-ass
posts" were taken down?

18:26.229 --> 18:28.866
A-A dude might've made
a little burner account

18:28.899 --> 18:31.235
- to check your page from time to time.
- Oh. Okay.

18:31.269 --> 18:34.672
But I still think your dad
did you a favor.

18:34.705 --> 18:37.675
Yo, you're too smart and talented.

18:37.707 --> 18:39.878
You're doper than that.

18:39.910 --> 18:41.912
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

18:44.247 --> 18:48.052
So, um... see you around.

18:48.085 --> 18:51.488
- Hope so.
- Yeah, see you.

18:59.530 --> 19:01.166
- Hey.
- Uh, hey.

19:01.198 --> 19:03.311
I got your text about
academic probation.

19:03.336 --> 19:04.971
That's great.
Oh, wait. Wait, wait, wait.

19:05.012 --> 19:06.615
Where are you going?
I was hoping to talk to you.

19:06.647 --> 19:08.783
I'm so sorry. I really can't right now.

19:08.817 --> 19:11.181
Today's been, um, a really tough day,

19:11.206 --> 19:12.269
so I'm just gonna...

19:12.294 --> 19:13.448
You know, I'll catch you.
I'll catch you.

19:13.473 --> 19:15.332
Oh.

19:17.358 --> 19:20.295
I'm sleeping with Aaron.

19:21.829 --> 19:24.832
<i>So, I was only halfway
through my sophomore year,</i>

19:24.865 --> 19:27.469
<i>and it felt like my life was unraveling.</i>

19:27.501 --> 19:29.538
<i>My dad was disappointed in me,</i>

19:29.570 --> 19:31.706
<i>I barely managed to stay in school,</i>

19:31.740 --> 19:33.675
<i>and now after being cut off,</i>

19:33.709 --> 19:37.179
<i>I had no idea how I was
even going to pay for it.</i>

19:37.211 --> 19:39.647
<i>I had hit rock bottom.</i>

19:39.681 --> 19:41.850
- Hey.
- Hi.

19:41.883 --> 19:43.552
You okay?

19:45.753 --> 19:47.522
No, Aaron, I'm not,

19:47.556 --> 19:50.925
because I feel like I've just had
this major bomb dropped on me.

19:50.959 --> 19:52.361
Shit.

19:52.394 --> 19:55.998
Uh... I'm so sorry.

19:56.030 --> 19:58.000
I don't know. I just feel like I'm on

19:58.032 --> 19:59.701
the verge of a nervous breakdown.

19:59.734 --> 20:02.370
I've never felt more blindsided.

20:02.403 --> 20:05.007
Look, Zoey, we didn't mean
to hurt you, okay?

20:05.039 --> 20:07.875
It's just, Ana's cool, right?

20:07.909 --> 20:11.789
And then things just kind of...
they happened.

20:12.713 --> 20:14.849
Okay, what are <i> you</i> talking about?

20:14.883 --> 20:16.619
What happened with you and Ana?

20:16.652 --> 20:19.688
W-Wait. Did Ana not talk to you?

20:19.721 --> 20:23.062
Talk to me about what?

20:25.326 --> 20:26.929
Um...

20:38.272 --> 20:41.618
Stop it. Stop it. And sit down.

20:46.815 --> 20:51.487
So, um, how long you and my
granddaughter been an item?

20:51.519 --> 20:54.093
About six months.

20:54.125 --> 20:56.665
We basically started as friends.

20:56.692 --> 20:59.761
Yeah, that's usually how it starts...

21:01.430 --> 21:02.564
Mm-hmm.

21:02.596 --> 21:05.901
No. I won't.

21:05.933 --> 21:09.437
Um, oh, been meaning to tell you, I...

21:09.471 --> 21:11.411
I like this linen joint you got going.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.653
It's fire.

21:12.678 --> 21:14.343
Thank you.

21:14.375 --> 21:15.610
No doubt.

21:15.644 --> 21:17.613
I'm not mad at that kimono.

21:20.115 --> 21:22.151
Do you wanna try it on?

21:24.452 --> 21:25.586

21:25.619 --> 21:27.588

21:49.502 --> 21:51.902
