01:04.991 --> 01:06.258
Diddily...

01:06.292 --> 01:08.593
diddily, diddily, diddily...

01:08.628 --> 01:11.396
Asterisk, pound sign,
at sign, exclamation point!

01:11.431 --> 01:13.098
Don't worry,
the Holy Rollers

01:13.132 --> 01:15.617
are still up by one
on the Pin Pals.

01:15.635 --> 01:17.002
Gentlemen,
prepare to meet

01:17.036 --> 01:18.837
your various makers, there.

01:18.871 --> 01:23.508
'Cause we got one last frame by
our new anchorman, Dan Gillick.

01:23.543 --> 01:25.243
Thank God Otto had
that psychotic break

01:25.278 --> 01:26.511
and quit the team.

01:26.546 --> 01:28.480
Is this the
Bridge to Terabithia?

01:28.514 --> 01:30.499
It's beautiful.

01:30.533 --> 01:33.018
The day my Frisbee
landed in your yard

01:33.069 --> 01:35.187
was the luckiest day
of my life.

01:35.221 --> 01:36.922
And when you threw
your son after it,

01:36.956 --> 01:38.190
I enjoyed meeting him, too.

01:38.224 --> 01:39.291
He's a good boy.

01:52.055 --> 01:54.289
Sorry, guys.
Emergency meeting at work.

01:54.323 --> 01:56.858
Oh, please, I am missing eight
birthday parties for this!

01:56.893 --> 01:58.043
Just granny-throw it!

01:58.077 --> 02:00.012
Keep my ball.

02:00.046 --> 02:02.531
Well, looks like
the faithful have defeated

02:02.565 --> 02:05.367
a hedonist,
a Hindu and a...

02:05.401 --> 02:06.073
What are you?

02:06.098 --> 02:07.968
You know when your dog's
having a bad dream?

02:08.204 --> 02:09.588
That's who I pray to.

02:17.997 --> 02:20.866
Boys, I'm afraid the government
has finally caught up with me

02:20.900 --> 02:24.052
and my appeals are exhausted.

02:24.087 --> 02:27.489
Tomorrow,
I begin serving jury duty.

02:27.523 --> 02:29.024
That's a tough
break, boss.

02:29.058 --> 02:30.592
Don't sign petitions

02:30.626 --> 02:32.577
outside the grocery store
no more!

02:32.612 --> 02:34.179
I felt bad for the guy,

02:34.213 --> 02:37.049
sitting there
at his little card table.

02:37.083 --> 02:41.036
Anyway, I must name
a temporary replacement.

02:43.039 --> 02:45.507
Your temporary don is...

02:45.541 --> 02:48.326
our accountant, Dan.

02:50.279 --> 02:51.947
Fat Tony, a word?

02:51.981 --> 02:55.167
How about "meringue"?
That's a great word, but...

02:55.201 --> 02:57.569
I'm just a numbers guy,
and the only reason

02:57.603 --> 02:59.304
I say "numbers guy"
instead of "Wharton MBA"

02:59.338 --> 03:00.856
is 'cause I want
to blend in.

03:00.890 --> 03:02.491
I know what I'm doing.

03:02.525 --> 03:04.059
We are bleeding red ink,

03:04.093 --> 03:07.395
which is the only thing
we should not be bleeding.

03:11.167 --> 03:13.235
Hey, listen, everyone,

03:13.269 --> 03:15.804
I know a good
ice-breaking exercise.

03:15.838 --> 03:18.640
Let's all say something
that we are afraid of.

03:18.674 --> 03:20.308
For me, it's you guys.

03:20.343 --> 03:22.410
I'm afraid I might
kill this guy right now.

03:22.445 --> 03:24.062
Ring, ring.
Is that my phone?

03:24.097 --> 03:25.430
I think it is.
Hello?

03:25.465 --> 03:27.232
Yes, sweetie, it's Daddy.

03:27.266 --> 03:28.800
Listen, how would you feel

03:28.835 --> 03:30.302
if I just disappeared?

03:30.336 --> 03:32.304
Sad, right? Sad?

03:32.338 --> 03:34.372
Okay, you know what?
I'll tell the guys.

03:34.407 --> 03:36.641
She's crying, guys.
Cassidy is crying.

03:36.676 --> 03:39.111
Well, I hope you feel
proud of yourself.

03:39.145 --> 03:40.979
Cassidy is
a girl's name now?

03:49.088 --> 03:50.822
I know this music.

03:50.857 --> 03:52.557
It was a Bugs Bunny!

03:52.592 --> 03:56.228
Oh, what I wouldn't give
for an anvil to fall on me.

03:56.262 --> 03:57.345
D'oh!

03:57.380 --> 03:59.664
Shh! Here comes
Lisa's solo.

03:59.699 --> 04:02.000
♪

04:06.606 --> 04:10.008
This is why
I'm a season subscriber.

04:14.831 --> 04:15.964
Lisa!

04:15.998 --> 04:18.366
When I prayed for this
concert to be over,

04:18.401 --> 04:19.868
I didn't mean like this!

04:19.902 --> 04:20.918
I did.

04:20.952 --> 04:22.654
Where's the school nurse?

04:22.688 --> 04:24.539
Here I am.

04:24.574 --> 04:26.558
Budget cuts.

04:32.215 --> 04:34.382
Lisa, I suspect you fainted
because you thought

04:34.417 --> 04:37.485
Justin Bieber was in
the audience.

04:37.503 --> 04:40.622
Well, once again, laughter
is the worst medicine.

04:40.656 --> 04:42.824
Young lady, you're not
getting enough iron.

04:42.859 --> 04:45.126
Please say it's
the vegetarianism.

04:45.161 --> 04:47.062
It's not
the vegetarianism.

04:47.096 --> 04:48.813
It's a little bit
the vegetarianism.

04:48.848 --> 04:51.783
Lisa, if you must forgo meat,
I advise you to take

04:51.817 --> 04:54.019
these iron supplements.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.339
It's like swallowing
dollhouse furniture.

05:00.259 --> 05:03.061
Gentlemen,
look at what we are spending

05:03.095 --> 05:05.714
every month
just on olive oil.

05:05.748 --> 05:07.716
We love our bread-dipping.

05:07.750 --> 05:10.218
Okay, can't touch
the bread-dipping.

05:10.253 --> 05:14.539
Here's what Joey the Arsonist
thinks of your spreadsheet. Heh?

05:14.574 --> 05:17.842
Ha-ha-ha!
This <i>is</i> fun.

05:17.877 --> 05:20.161
But you know what?
There is a cost-cutting measure

05:20.195 --> 05:22.330
If you put

05:22.364 --> 05:24.082
a horse's head in someone's bed,

05:24.133 --> 05:26.868
don't let the rest
of the animal go to waste.

05:26.886 --> 05:28.937
For the next guy,
use the horse's leg.

05:28.971 --> 05:30.372
Or... a couple of hooves.

05:30.406 --> 05:33.008
Believe me, there is
no part of a dead horse

05:33.042 --> 05:34.943
that's not gonna scare someone.

05:34.977 --> 05:37.112
Okay, good stopping point.

05:37.146 --> 05:38.280
Aah!

05:38.314 --> 05:40.615
Okay...
Was that real?

05:49.242 --> 05:52.377
A kid's never lonely
when he has bologna.

05:52.411 --> 05:53.929
Except me.

05:59.652 --> 06:02.209
You're that Simpson
kid, Bart, right?

06:02.234 --> 06:02.988
Lisa.

06:02.989 --> 06:06.558
I just see mouths.
Can't handle the iron pills?

06:06.592 --> 06:09.094
All day I have vitamin burps.

06:09.128 --> 06:11.129
Try this-- it's
what keeps me young.

06:13.766 --> 06:17.035
Mmm, tasty.
Love the texture.

06:17.069 --> 06:19.237
What is it?
Beetle mush.

06:19.272 --> 06:21.973
But I'm a vegetarian!

06:22.008 --> 06:25.510
So am I. Lots of committed
vegetarians eat insects.

06:25.544 --> 06:27.646
Really?
Get real.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.314
There's bug parts
in peanut butter.

06:29.348 --> 06:31.216
And every year,
the average American eats

06:31.250 --> 06:32.984
eight spiders in his sleep.

06:33.019 --> 06:34.586
It's all here in this book.

06:35.988 --> 06:39.424
This is such a big step.

06:39.458 --> 06:41.159
Better decide soon, kid.

06:41.193 --> 06:43.762
The union said I can't talk
to a student this long.

06:43.796 --> 06:46.598
Mmm, that is good grub.

06:46.632 --> 06:49.734
But I promised Paul McCartney
I wouldn't eat meat.

06:49.769 --> 06:53.938
And I promised Paul McCartney
I wouldn't sleep with John.

06:55.660 --> 06:58.207
So, you're saying you'd
rather do the prettiest dude

06:58.307 --> 06:59.975
in the world
than the ugliest broad?

07:00.009 --> 07:02.027
Absolutely.
But how did we get here

07:02.061 --> 07:04.462
from discussing
Aristotle's <i>Poetics?</i>

07:04.497 --> 07:06.247
Well, well,

07:06.265 --> 07:08.867
if it isn't Mr. Work
Comes Before Bowling.

07:08.901 --> 07:11.136
I am turning my back
because I can't stand

07:11.170 --> 07:12.704
to look you in the face.

07:13.739 --> 07:14.706
Ooh!

07:15.758 --> 07:16.958
You.

07:16.993 --> 07:18.410
Part of my new

07:18.444 --> 07:19.945
rice wine promotion.

07:19.979 --> 07:21.913
So, now you think you can
just waltz in here

07:21.948 --> 07:23.214
and buy everybody a beer?

07:23.249 --> 07:24.449
I didn't say that I...

07:24.483 --> 07:25.617
Too late.
I already poured.

07:25.651 --> 07:27.085
Oh, sorry, guys.

07:27.119 --> 07:28.453
I got the kind of job that

07:28.487 --> 07:30.088
you just can't play hooky from.

07:30.122 --> 07:32.958
Well, I have no idea what
you do or who you work with,

07:32.992 --> 07:35.827
but I am sure if you put
your foot down on their throats

07:35.861 --> 07:37.629
and grind until
you hear a crunch,

07:37.663 --> 07:39.097
they'll sit up straight.

07:39.131 --> 07:40.732
Really? You're
sure about this?

07:40.766 --> 07:43.268
Oh, hey, listen, I learned
a lot about human nature

07:43.302 --> 07:45.804
by watching things
through secret cameras.

07:45.838 --> 07:48.239
Uh-huh.
All right, then. Okay.

07:48.274 --> 07:51.176
We'll see about
that <i>bread-dipping.</i>

07:51.210 --> 07:55.280
Thank you. Thank you
for giving me an attitude.

07:55.314 --> 07:58.183
Thank you for
giving me an edge.

08:01.337 --> 08:04.639
Or maybe it's groveling
that works.

08:04.674 --> 08:07.175
Hmm. Eh, six of one.

08:07.209 --> 08:09.544
<i>Attention, Gourmands</i>

08:09.578 --> 08:12.347
of All Things Creepy
and Crawly.

08:12.381 --> 08:15.967
Please welcome long-time
squisher, first-time eater,

08:16.002 --> 08:17.869
Lisa Simpson.
 Delighted.

08:27.046 --> 08:30.048
Hey, waiter,
there's no fly in my soup.

08:30.082 --> 08:32.000
Sorry.

08:32.034 --> 08:34.169
Little more.
Little more.

08:34.203 --> 08:35.336
Perfect.

08:36.871 --> 08:39.674
Just-a once, why can't
they go to Applebee's?

08:39.708 --> 08:41.576
Okay, fellas.

08:41.610 --> 08:45.296
This time, why don't
<i>I</i> do the cutting?

08:45.331 --> 08:47.515
What are you doing?
I talk with that hand.

08:47.550 --> 08:48.817
Well, you're
gonna lose it

08:48.851 --> 08:51.519
if you keep charging
your manicures to us.

08:51.554 --> 08:54.339
If you don't like it,
tough tortellini!

08:54.373 --> 08:56.858
And while we're at it,
no more tortellini!

08:56.876 --> 08:59.244
I'm dominating you!

08:59.278 --> 09:01.513
Anyone got a problem? Huh?!

09:01.547 --> 09:03.698
Kenny the Problem?
I'm good.

09:03.733 --> 09:05.984
What's this I hear
about no more tortellini?

09:06.018 --> 09:07.552
Only for Christmas and funerals.

09:07.586 --> 09:09.587
No, please, please,
I need-a the money.

09:09.622 --> 09:13.575
She's-a pay for my-- how
you say?-- English lessons.

09:13.609 --> 09:15.076
My name-a Luigi.

09:15.111 --> 09:17.262
I live at a-one, a-two,
a-three, Main-a Street.

09:26.555 --> 09:28.423
So, if I'm growing
grasshoppers to eat,

09:28.457 --> 09:30.425
am I farmer or a rancher?

09:30.459 --> 09:33.194
There are going to be a lot
of heated blogs on this topic.

09:33.229 --> 09:36.514
Lisa, dinnertime!

09:46.108 --> 09:48.309
Lisa eats bugs!

09:48.344 --> 09:49.811
Bart! This is America.

09:49.845 --> 09:51.579
Anyone can eat
what they want

09:51.614 --> 09:53.448
as long as they
eat too much.

09:53.482 --> 09:56.084
Lisa, would you
like some shrimp?

09:56.118 --> 09:57.719
Hmm.

10:05.027 --> 10:09.063
You know... shrimp aren't all
<i>that</i> removed from grasshoppers.

10:09.098 --> 10:11.166
They're both arthropods.

10:18.474 --> 10:22.327
Oh, you did that to help me out.

10:23.629 --> 10:26.030
Not sure what
your motivation for that is.

10:28.167 --> 10:30.001
Lunch break.

10:32.872 --> 10:34.239
Make this quick.

10:34.273 --> 10:36.174
I finally got
a chair by the window.

10:36.208 --> 10:39.310
I'm afraid the little
Bulgarian lady will take it.

10:39.345 --> 10:40.678
Bottom line, Tone,

10:40.713 --> 10:42.947
I cut expenses 12%.

10:42.982 --> 10:45.617
As my more ruthless cousin
on Wall Street would say,

10:45.651 --> 10:47.719
cut another 12.

10:47.753 --> 10:50.155
But the only other cuts left
are personnel.

10:50.189 --> 10:51.923
There are
redundancies.

10:51.957 --> 10:53.825
Like Shotgun Pete,
Shotgun Mike,

10:53.859 --> 10:56.394
Ronnie the Rifle,
Shotgun the Rifle...

10:56.428 --> 10:59.430
All good men,
but some must go.

10:59.465 --> 11:01.065
I agree.

11:01.100 --> 11:03.234
I will announce the layoffs.

11:03.269 --> 11:05.236
Welcome to
the dole, boys.

11:06.605 --> 11:10.909
You jedrool, in our business,
you don't lay them off,

11:10.943 --> 11:12.744
you lay them out.

11:12.778 --> 11:13.745
Right.

11:13.779 --> 11:14.913
What?

11:14.947 --> 11:16.614
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

11:16.649 --> 11:18.550
Oh, boy, you mean,
kill them?

11:18.584 --> 11:20.285
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to shout.

11:21.704 --> 11:23.087
Damn, she eats a quick lunch.

11:23.122 --> 11:24.105
Got to go.

11:24.139 --> 11:25.957
Nice breeze, huh?

11:28.611 --> 11:32.580
You have breasts like woman,
but cannot give suck.

11:32.615 --> 11:34.449
Quit saying that!

11:39.371 --> 11:41.789
Get along, little buggies.

11:41.824 --> 11:43.658
If I may,
just one question.

11:43.692 --> 11:45.627
Why are you eating us?

11:45.661 --> 11:47.195
You don't feel any pain.

11:47.229 --> 11:48.963
Wha...?!
Who told you that?

11:48.998 --> 11:50.798
Um... I just assumed.

11:50.833 --> 11:53.401
This is what you've
been dipping in chocolate.

11:55.004 --> 11:56.404
Nooo!

11:56.438 --> 11:58.673
I'm afraid sooo!

11:58.707 --> 11:59.974
Nooo!

12:00.009 --> 12:01.342
Sooo!

12:02.378 --> 12:03.344
Oh, thank God.

12:03.379 --> 12:04.579
Just a dream.

12:06.599 --> 12:07.949
I've been meat-walking.

12:07.983 --> 12:09.984
Bart, I can't
eat bugs anymore.

12:10.019 --> 12:12.153
Please, please
take my grasshoppers

12:12.187 --> 12:15.757
as far away as you can
and release them into the wild.

12:15.791 --> 12:18.459
Okay, but when I grow up
and I'm living on your couch,

12:18.494 --> 12:20.695
and I drink all your booze,
and sell your jewelry,

12:20.729 --> 12:22.697
you got to be cool.

12:22.731 --> 12:24.048
I'll be cool.

12:24.083 --> 12:26.484
But I will not be sharing
my mini-fridge with Homer.

12:26.518 --> 12:28.086
He's there too?

12:29.455 --> 12:30.922
Almost...

12:32.207 --> 12:34.292
Eh, free is free.

12:40.299 --> 12:41.499
He wants me
to kill them!

12:41.533 --> 12:43.001
Sorry, sorry.

12:43.035 --> 12:44.352
First of all, hi.
Hi, Dan.

12:44.386 --> 12:46.988
Secondly, remember when
you asked who I worked for

12:47.022 --> 12:48.306
and I wouldn't say

12:48.340 --> 12:50.441
I'm a mob boss.

12:50.476 --> 12:54.112
I'm running Fat Tony's gang
while he's on jury duty.

12:54.146 --> 12:55.647
Doodie.

12:55.681 --> 12:57.048
Homer, that's not the shocking part.
Oh?

12:57.082 --> 12:59.317
He wants me to kill
a bunch of guys.

12:59.351 --> 13:00.835
I've got a gun.
Look.

13:00.869 --> 13:02.153
Oh, my God!

13:02.187 --> 13:04.138
You want me to help you escape?
No!

13:04.173 --> 13:06.357
I want you to stop me
from doing it.

13:06.392 --> 13:08.826
You wha...?!
I want to do it, Homer.

13:08.877 --> 13:10.745
It's the ultimate
business model.

13:10.779 --> 13:12.964
In my business,
I try not to be seen.

13:12.998 --> 13:14.966
I'm scary good at it.

13:16.001 --> 13:16.968
Homer!
Mmm.

13:17.002 --> 13:18.169
Everything's
led to this.

13:18.203 --> 13:19.470
I remember,
the first time

13:19.505 --> 13:21.706
I fired someone
face-to-face, I cried.

13:21.740 --> 13:23.041
I cried.

13:23.075 --> 13:25.093
Saved the tear.

13:25.127 --> 13:26.294
Please stop.

13:26.328 --> 13:27.862
I just wanted my Frisbee back
from your yard.

13:27.896 --> 13:29.998
They fired me
for not being tough.

13:30.032 --> 13:32.750
I had learned that
in order to succeed,

13:32.785 --> 13:35.586
you must disregard
the dangerous distraction

13:35.621 --> 13:37.689
of being human.

13:37.723 --> 13:39.424
And it brought me here.

13:39.458 --> 13:42.460
You scratch a businessman and
you get a coldblooded killer.

13:42.494 --> 13:45.029
Well, I've been scratched!

13:47.816 --> 13:50.835
This is how I get out
of doing the dishes.

13:54.439 --> 13:56.423
Come on, buddy, why would
you want to be a murderer?

13:56.458 --> 13:57.691
I don't know.

13:57.726 --> 14:00.160
My training, this
opportunity, it's like...

14:00.195 --> 14:01.729
A perfect storm?

14:01.763 --> 14:03.630
I hate that expression!

14:03.665 --> 14:05.149
So overused!

14:05.183 --> 14:07.067
Okay, I don't... I don't
know why I said it.

14:07.118 --> 14:08.485
I was scared.
I needed a response.

14:08.519 --> 14:09.820
It was a perfect storm!

14:09.854 --> 14:10.871
Say something original!

14:13.925 --> 14:17.294
Uh, Greek thing, uh,
grand b-banana of...

14:17.328 --> 14:21.398
far-na... of f-forever
thing, bleeks blah-blah,

14:21.433 --> 14:23.300
a comma... a com...

14:23.334 --> 14:26.403
a commonality
beret burrito.

14:26.438 --> 14:28.539
Oh, it looks like
a kidnapping in progress, Chief.

14:28.573 --> 14:30.240
You always
frame everything

14:30.275 --> 14:32.309
in the worst
possible light.

14:32.343 --> 14:35.412
Chief, can I ask-- why do you
want to be a policeman?

14:35.447 --> 14:37.181
Adrenaline junkie.

14:37.215 --> 14:40.634
My dad used to tie me up when
the ice cream truck went by.

14:40.668 --> 14:42.469
And now there's
no amount of ice cream

14:42.504 --> 14:44.571
that will make me feel full,
so this should work.

14:44.606 --> 14:45.906
Yeah.
That's right.

14:45.940 --> 14:47.241
Tie them tighter.
Mmm!

14:47.275 --> 14:49.042
Oh, that's good.
Oh, that burns.

14:49.077 --> 14:52.096
Could you please not sound
like you like it so much?

14:52.130 --> 14:53.397
Sorry.

14:53.431 --> 14:55.466
I'm into a lot of weird stuff.

14:55.500 --> 14:57.518
Now stay down here
and I'll be back

14:57.552 --> 14:59.103
every hour with food.

14:59.137 --> 15:01.371
And every six hours
with food for you.

15:01.406 --> 15:04.141
Thanks, man.
'Preciate it!

15:04.175 --> 15:07.377
Ah, look.
I have company.

15:07.412 --> 15:08.645
Hello.

15:08.680 --> 15:10.547
Hello to you and your friend.

15:10.582 --> 15:11.882
It's a party.

15:19.190 --> 15:22.092
I'm going to call you Buggy,

15:22.127 --> 15:25.428
and I'll call you--
please don't go in my mouth.

15:25.447 --> 15:27.581
All right, you can go
in my mouth.

15:27.615 --> 15:29.249
Just don't lay egg...

15:31.085 --> 15:33.020
We now return to <i>AFI Presents</i>

15:33.054 --> 15:35.522
<i>The 100 Greatest Movie Screams.</i>

15:35.557 --> 15:38.625
Number 60,
from <i>Teen Wolf Too...</i>

15:39.928 --> 15:41.428
Classic.

15:42.530 --> 15:45.699
Someone must be
watching on another TV.

15:45.733 --> 15:48.569
The bug!

15:48.603 --> 15:51.271
I really think that's
coming from our house.

15:51.306 --> 15:53.273
Will you stop
saying things

15:53.308 --> 15:55.676
that'll make me
have to do something?

15:55.710 --> 15:57.344
Next, we've got three screams

15:57.378 --> 15:59.279
from <i>Scream 3.</i>

16:02.450 --> 16:05.652
That was four screams.
Stupid AFI.

16:05.687 --> 16:09.256
Boy, never go into their
directors training program.

16:09.290 --> 16:11.258
How about the Disney
Minority Program?

16:11.292 --> 16:13.026
Now, how would you
qualify for that?

16:13.061 --> 16:14.561
I'm the son
of an oaf.

16:14.596 --> 16:16.330
Have fun getting coffee

16:16.364 --> 16:18.732
for Roy Disney the Third.

16:20.101 --> 16:21.268
Dinnertime.

16:21.302 --> 16:22.586
I know you're hungry.

16:22.620 --> 16:24.655
I can hear you rubbing
your legs together and...

16:24.689 --> 16:26.640
Oh, my God!

16:29.127 --> 16:30.694
I never thought Homer Simpson

16:30.728 --> 16:33.514
would be a part
of the Day of the Locust.

16:33.548 --> 16:34.932
Thanks.

16:34.966 --> 16:37.935
Now, turn around and
get on your knees.

16:37.969 --> 16:40.254
Are you gonna shoot me
in the back of the head?

16:40.288 --> 16:42.389
No, I just know it takes you
so long to get up

16:42.423 --> 16:44.091
I'll have plenty
of time to escape.

16:52.516 --> 16:54.952
I'll fix that later.

17:01.416 --> 17:04.451
Your Honor, we have
reached a verdict.

17:08.873 --> 17:10.339
Johnny Tightlips.

17:10.374 --> 17:11.508
Give me one reason

17:11.541 --> 17:13.577
why I shouldn't
kill you right now.

17:13.611 --> 17:15.929
There's a great one, but you'll
never get it out of me.

17:15.963 --> 17:19.132
On vacation, he digs
wells in Darfur!

17:19.166 --> 17:20.233
Damn it!

17:21.169 --> 17:23.069
We find the defendant...

17:23.104 --> 17:25.070
And now it's time
for Final Jeopardy.

17:25.106 --> 17:26.906
Pay attention, players.
The category is...

17:26.941 --> 17:28.708
You think you're
so smart, Alex Trebek.

17:28.743 --> 17:32.078
I remember when you
were Alphonse Trebagoogoo.

17:32.113 --> 17:33.246
Stop!

17:33.281 --> 17:34.498
Make me!

17:35.900 --> 17:37.200
Come on!

17:37.235 --> 17:39.953
You said we were gonna
see somebody get shot.

17:39.987 --> 17:41.721
...not guilty.

17:41.756 --> 17:44.658
I'll have your money
in an hour.

17:51.098 --> 17:52.466
Dan!

17:52.500 --> 17:54.301
How do you keep
finding me?

17:54.335 --> 17:56.136
You really should
tweet less.

17:56.170 --> 17:57.804
But everyone
deserves to know

17:57.839 --> 17:59.306
what I'm thinking
all the time.

17:59.340 --> 18:00.874
Just listen, if you
kill those guys,

18:00.908 --> 18:03.143
you'll be as bad
as they are.

18:03.177 --> 18:04.261
I don't think so.

18:04.295 --> 18:05.529
They've killed
a lot of people,

18:05.563 --> 18:07.130
and they tell their wives
they're working,

18:07.165 --> 18:08.765
but they're really
just hanging out.

18:08.800 --> 18:12.402
Look, just give me the gun
before you hurt somebody.

18:12.436 --> 18:14.337
Give it to me.

18:19.660 --> 18:23.296
Oh, I can't kill you.

18:23.331 --> 18:24.698
I knew you were weak.

18:24.732 --> 18:27.000
If you think I'm so weak,
give me back the gun.

18:27.034 --> 18:28.301
You are weak, but no.

18:28.336 --> 18:30.170
Let's see how weak I am
with the gun.

18:30.204 --> 18:31.588
No, I don't want to.
Give me the gun.

18:31.622 --> 18:32.789
I don't want
to see it.

18:32.824 --> 18:34.257
You're making my mad and
I want to shoot you now.

18:34.292 --> 18:35.258
I don't have to see it.

18:35.293 --> 18:36.293
Huh?!

18:37.395 --> 18:38.395
Give it to me!
I can imagine it.

18:38.429 --> 18:39.663
Give me the gun.
No.

18:39.697 --> 18:41.264
Come on, weakling,
get it from me.

18:41.299 --> 18:43.350
I'm not... You want...
I'm not weak with the gun.

18:43.384 --> 18:45.235
Yeah, well, yeah,
but see who's got it now.

18:45.269 --> 18:47.253
When I have a gun,
I'm not weak at all.

18:47.271 --> 18:48.438
Yeah, well,
you ain't so...

18:50.875 --> 18:52.809
Clean-up on aisle me.

18:56.547 --> 18:59.299
Okay, Mom,
I think that's far enough.

19:02.954 --> 19:06.540
Finally, a place where you
can spread your wings and hop.

19:16.684 --> 19:18.301
We're free!

19:18.336 --> 19:20.170
No, no, I'm still
gonna figure this out.

19:20.204 --> 19:21.538
There was
a corner here.

19:21.572 --> 19:22.539
David...

19:22.573 --> 19:24.140
Damn it, Judy,
let me have this!

19:26.077 --> 19:27.410
So, Tone, you're
sure you didn't

19:27.445 --> 19:29.579
order those fiduciary-
related whacks?

19:29.614 --> 19:32.582
The important thing is
we have severely cut costs

19:32.617 --> 19:35.785
by reducing the number
of our guns to one.

19:35.820 --> 19:37.520
And I have it.

19:37.555 --> 19:39.756
Any further questions?

19:39.790 --> 19:41.358
Can I have the gun?
No.

19:41.392 --> 19:43.176
What happened to our
friend Mr. Gillick?

19:43.210 --> 19:44.644
I don't know.

19:44.679 --> 19:47.247
But once your finger has felt
the itch of a trigger,

19:47.281 --> 19:51.301
there is no relief till
said trigger has been squeezed.

19:51.335 --> 19:53.653
Sometimes late in life
you find your calling.

19:53.688 --> 19:57.390
The heft of the gun,
the trigger in your hand...

19:57.425 --> 19:58.625
Can you hurry
this up, please?

19:58.659 --> 20:00.627
My daughter's got
cheerleading practice.

20:00.661 --> 20:03.463
Oh, I-I can go fast.

20:03.497 --> 20:04.898
Ba-da boom!

20:04.932 --> 20:06.366
Could you please
not do that?

20:06.400 --> 20:08.034
Is there some kind
of problem here?

20:08.069 --> 20:10.503
And if not, can you
do my belly button?

20:10.538 --> 20:12.839
Need some place to hang
my badge at the sauna.
