44:41.790 --> 44:43.350
Just as you like them.

45:24.750 --> 45:26.150
[LUCY GROANS]

45:39.550 --> 45:41.670
How she wakes.

45:42.790 --> 45:46.270
You dirty, filthy harlot.

45:51.230 --> 45:52.550
Argh!

45:58.910 --> 46:00.310
[HE GRUNTS]

46:05.230 --> 46:07.629
You stupid old crone!

46:07.630 --> 46:09.949
[THEY STRAIN]

46:09.950 --> 46:12.189
A-a-a-agh!

46:12.190 --> 46:13.790
Argh!

46:27.310 --> 46:28.629
You...

46:28.630 --> 46:31.110
fucking whores!

46:34.310 --> 46:36.630
[BOTH LAUGH]

46:45.470 --> 46:47.830
- Oh.
- [BOTH LAUGH]

47:00.630 --> 47:02.629
I see red mist sometimes.

47:02.630 --> 47:04.070
I'm sorry.

47:08.910 --> 47:10.670
Me too.

47:14.960 --> 47:16.823
You're going away...

47:16.824 --> 47:18.504
to serve in the Navy.

47:19.110 --> 47:20.669
And when you're done...

47:20.670 --> 47:23.549
you can start afresh somewhere else.

47:23.550 --> 47:26.550
Saracens is mine, you understand?

47:28.066 --> 47:29.189
Emily...

47:29.190 --> 47:31.767
That's the price for your freedom.

47:31.768 --> 47:32.789
Emily.

47:32.790 --> 47:34.669
Come on, come on.

47:34.670 --> 47:36.469
[HE GRUNTS] Emily!

47:36.470 --> 47:38.430
Emily!

47:40.870 --> 47:42.829
Right...

47:42.830 --> 47:44.510
you all answer to me now.

47:45.430 --> 47:46.590
Is that clear?

47:47.590 --> 47:49.389
Oi!

47:49.390 --> 47:50.590
Throw her out.

47:53.470 --> 47:55.350
Out! Let's go.

48:05.550 --> 48:06.910
He tried to rape me.

48:07.750 --> 48:09.269
He had a knife.

48:09.270 --> 48:10.910
We had to kill him.

48:11.790 --> 48:13.189
"We"?

48:13.190 --> 48:14.793
Well, there was a fearful struggle,

48:14.794 --> 48:16.709
we had to defend ourselves.

48:16.710 --> 48:18.109
[HE SIGHS]

48:18.110 --> 48:20.949
I wanted to put this man on a gibbet.

48:20.950 --> 48:22.629
But I can settle for a shady death

48:22.630 --> 48:24.389
at the hands of two
jades in the brothel.

48:24.390 --> 48:26.589
He'll be found in an alley...

48:26.590 --> 48:27.949
robbed.

48:27.950 --> 48:29.670
And the culprit will never be caught.

48:43.167 --> 48:44.327
Right, ladies...

48:46.310 --> 48:47.550
... let's get to work.

49:02.510 --> 49:04.110
Emma Harrison.

49:07.310 --> 49:08.670
How do you do?

49:10.990 --> 49:13.429
When his Royal Highness tires of you...

49:13.430 --> 49:16.069
[SHE CHUCKLES] ... you
can live here with me.

49:16.070 --> 49:17.870
Mm.

49:20.990 --> 49:22.470
You saved my life.

49:23.270 --> 49:24.789
You...

49:24.790 --> 49:27.069
showed me how to survive.

49:27.070 --> 49:28.470
But...

49:30.217 --> 49:31.977
... but I won't live with you again.

49:34.390 --> 49:35.630
I understand.

49:37.090 --> 49:38.129
I scare you.

49:38.130 --> 49:39.330
Hm.

49:51.890 --> 49:53.690
You don't scare me.
