00:36.879 --> 00:39.882
Gornak! Run for your lives.

00:44.520 --> 00:47.423
Save me! Save me!

01:03.873 --> 01:06.910
Lorash, sweet
of you to wait for me.

01:10.746 --> 01:12.782
Go on home to
your meade, Ramicus.

01:13.516 --> 01:14.785
This bounty is as good as mine.

01:14.817 --> 01:16.585
You're doing this
for the bounty?

01:16.618 --> 01:17.787
I thought you were
about the booty.

01:17.820 --> 01:20.056
Sacrificial virgins
need love, too.

01:20.090 --> 01:21.791
And you know I'd
never miss a chance

01:21.825 --> 01:23.960
to poach in your territory.

01:23.993 --> 01:26.630
What'll this job be?
Five in a row for me?

01:26.662 --> 01:28.465
The bogwarf doesn't count.

01:28.865 --> 01:30.434
You know how I feel
about quicksand.

01:30.466 --> 01:33.436
Yes. And what will
your excuse be this time?

01:33.469 --> 01:34.971
Your horsie scared again?

01:35.004 --> 01:36.773
You leave horsie out of this.

01:36.805 --> 01:38.874
Look on
the bright side.

01:38.907 --> 01:40.743
Look at all the
gold I'm saving you.

01:40.776 --> 01:41.945
Taverns and the brothels.

01:43.145 --> 01:45.748
I know coin's a bit tight
for you right now, Ramicus.

01:45.781 --> 01:48.384
So when you come to,
first round's on me.

01:48.418 --> 01:49.453
Fair enough.

01:49.486 --> 01:50.686
Tell you what.

01:50.719 --> 01:51.855
Let's find you a
nice, safe tree,

01:51.888 --> 01:53.724
a lot of low-lying branches,

01:53.757 --> 01:54.758
and you can get...

02:02.399 --> 02:03.534
Hep!

02:16.613 --> 02:17.848
Let me out of here!

02:23.452 --> 02:25.688
Not today, gornak!

02:31.560 --> 02:33.028
See here, foul beast,

02:33.061 --> 02:35.531
this blade will piece your heart

02:35.565 --> 02:39.002
until the very last drop of
blood has drained from it.

03:12.035 --> 03:13.704
Bye, old friend.

03:22.178 --> 03:23.180
You are great.

03:23.213 --> 03:24.915
My reputation precedes me.

03:24.947 --> 03:26.615
Now to claim my prize.

03:26.649 --> 03:28.218
You deserve every
last coin, my lord.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.952
I'll take that, as well.

03:38.094 --> 03:39.662
You've done it.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.465
You saved my life.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.067
You've saved my entire village.

03:45.734 --> 03:47.904
How can I ever repay you?

03:49.939 --> 03:51.809
Let's start with this.

03:54.042 --> 03:56.612
Hey! Hello!

03:56.645 --> 03:59.048
Lorash, come on. Cool it.

03:59.082 --> 04:01.618
The last thing we need around
here is a Dolvarnog attack.

04:01.650 --> 04:03.052
He's right.

04:03.085 --> 04:04.954
We mustn't forget
about the beast.

04:04.988 --> 04:09.925
My dear child, this man is
nothing more than a peasant.

04:09.959 --> 04:14.064
Don't believe his foolish
folk tales and dragon stories.

04:14.096 --> 04:16.065
There's no such
thing as a Dolvar-

04:18.233 --> 04:20.769
No!

06:03.873 --> 06:05.742
My precious, surely.

06:05.774 --> 06:06.976
The ring. Is it ready?

06:07.010 --> 06:08.211
No need to hurry.

06:08.243 --> 06:09.311
You've been
traveling a long way.

06:09.344 --> 06:10.279
Why don't you lie down

06:10.312 --> 06:11.914
and let me give you a
little brain tickle?

06:11.947 --> 06:13.048
Belveeda, please.

06:13.082 --> 06:15.284
Your filthy advances will
not work on me this time.

06:15.317 --> 06:16.853
The ring. I need it.

06:16.885 --> 06:18.687
A healing stone with
power such as this

06:18.721 --> 06:20.824
does not come without its price.

06:20.856 --> 06:22.358
I have traveled to
the darkest caverns

06:22.392 --> 06:23.659
of this earth to find...

06:26.695 --> 06:29.231
You understand the
dangers you invoke?

06:29.264 --> 06:31.700
The moment you step
through that door,

06:31.733 --> 06:33.803
you begin a very
dark path, my dear.

06:33.836 --> 06:36.406
I realize the gravity
of my decisions.

06:36.438 --> 06:40.242
And I accept their consequences
honorably, fearing nothing.

06:40.276 --> 06:42.679
If a cruel dismemberment
is what you'd really like,

06:42.712 --> 06:44.680
why don't I just take
you to my bedchamber?

06:44.714 --> 06:47.351
Enough, woman. The ring, now!

07:10.238 --> 07:11.974
Forgive me, Camilan.

07:12.007 --> 07:14.077
I've grown so fond of
you over the years,

07:14.110 --> 07:15.745
and I hate to see
you throw it all away

07:15.777 --> 07:18.080
over something so futile.

07:18.113 --> 07:22.051
Come now, do not blame
me for desiring me.

07:22.485 --> 07:24.021
Many do.

07:24.753 --> 07:27.390
Now a greater calling is mine.

07:27.990 --> 07:30.160
Destiny awaits me.

07:30.993 --> 07:33.796
No matter the risk,
no matter the danger,

07:33.829 --> 07:36.166
I must plunge
forward, ring in hand,

07:36.199 --> 07:39.770
through the darkness,
and do what must be done.

07:40.736 --> 07:43.839
Larec, my sweet,
will you marry me?

07:43.873 --> 07:45.742
Yes, Camilan, yes!

07:45.774 --> 07:47.911
A thousand times, yes.

07:47.944 --> 07:52.816
Then accept this ring as a
token of my devotion to you.

07:52.849 --> 07:54.851
A genuine healing stone?

07:54.884 --> 07:57.454
A rare gem for the
rarest of beauty.

07:57.486 --> 07:59.054
Where did you get such a ring?

07:59.087 --> 08:00.289
Never mind how I found it.

08:00.322 --> 08:03.226
I found it. And I love you.

08:06.428 --> 08:08.897
Wait. What of the Dolvarnog?

08:08.930 --> 08:10.032
Fear not, my love.

08:10.065 --> 08:12.469
We are safe under
the canopy of night.

08:12.502 --> 08:15.172
You are free to let
your emotions flow.

08:18.908 --> 08:21.745
As long as you are in
my arms, you are safe.

08:21.777 --> 08:24.113
Not during the day, actually.

08:26.114 --> 08:28.884
How can a creature have
such hatred towards love?

08:28.917 --> 08:31.286
Do you speak of the
Dolvarnog, or of my father?

08:31.320 --> 08:32.821
Does it matter?

08:32.854 --> 08:34.190
Their wrath is equal.

08:34.222 --> 08:36.357
Come now. My father
doesn't breathe fire.

08:36.392 --> 08:37.525
There is no need.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.462
His words are just as painful.

08:39.494 --> 08:40.863
Larec, please.

08:40.897 --> 08:42.297
He'll never give consent.

08:42.330 --> 08:44.533
How could he
protest such a face?

08:44.566 --> 08:47.536
It's not my face he protests.

08:47.570 --> 08:51.141
Elf or human, we were
meant to be together.

08:51.807 --> 08:53.542
I promise you, from
this day forward,

08:53.575 --> 08:55.545
we will be together.
I know.

08:55.578 --> 08:57.480
I would slay a
thousand dragons for you,

08:57.512 --> 08:59.014
a hundred orcs,
Okay.

08:59.047 --> 09:00.816
- 4,000 pygmies
- Okay.

09:00.849 --> 09:03.820
It doesn't matter,
a...

09:12.395 --> 09:13.263
You can close your eyes,

09:13.296 --> 09:15.831
but your ears will
hear their shrieks.

09:19.535 --> 09:21.972
16 lovers destroyed today.

09:23.406 --> 09:25.541
Dolvarnog will
sleep well tonight.

09:26.242 --> 09:27.844
While other weep.

09:27.877 --> 09:32.115
They must learn that, as
long as love fills the air,

09:33.882 --> 09:37.152
this wretched creature will
rain down its destruction.

09:37.185 --> 09:38.887
You cannot blame the beast.

09:38.921 --> 09:40.924
He only does as you command.

09:40.956 --> 09:43.492
And obey it does.

09:44.026 --> 09:45.328
Imagine.

09:46.161 --> 09:49.531
Soon we will rid the land
of this crippling emotion.

09:49.565 --> 09:52.201
You cannot stop love, my lord.

09:52.234 --> 09:55.337
At least none
will dare show it.

09:57.607 --> 09:59.342
How can you be so cruel?

09:59.374 --> 10:01.109
Love is cruel, my lady.

10:01.142 --> 10:03.512
Why should I be any
different towards love?

10:03.546 --> 10:06.882
I won't rest until every
soul suffers as I have.

10:06.916 --> 10:08.917
Surely this cannot
bring you happiness.

10:08.950 --> 10:11.854
You are right. It
only salves the wound

10:11.887 --> 10:13.189
of my afflicted soul.

10:13.222 --> 10:14.958
But you...

10:15.992 --> 10:19.161
you have the power to heal it.

10:19.961 --> 10:21.563
End this madness.

10:21.597 --> 10:24.000
Humble your heart.
Accept my proposal.

10:24.032 --> 10:26.168
You know that
that's impossible.

10:26.201 --> 10:29.004
Is this so horrible a
fate that you will allow

10:29.037 --> 10:30.873
the death toll to rise?

10:30.906 --> 10:32.608
My dear Tensley, you
know that I cannot.

10:32.642 --> 10:34.142
I cannot accept you.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.012
You told me that you love me.

10:36.045 --> 10:37.213
We were children.

10:37.246 --> 10:39.015
Children don't lie!

10:40.916 --> 10:43.952
I'm sorry, my lord.

10:43.985 --> 10:45.520
Very well.

10:45.554 --> 10:47.424
The Dolvarnog flies at dawn.

11:07.676 --> 11:09.478
It's Elven bread.

11:10.546 --> 11:12.248
Larec wanted you to try it.

11:12.281 --> 11:14.050
Why aren't you
having any of this?

11:14.550 --> 11:18.054
I had some on my way
over, so I'm quite full.

11:18.086 --> 11:19.588
Your friend made it herself?

11:19.622 --> 11:22.992
She's not just
my friend, mother, but yes.

11:23.025 --> 11:25.929
You'd think that
an immortal race

11:25.961 --> 11:29.264
would have enough time to
develop better cuisine.

11:29.297 --> 11:31.600
I just don't
understand these creatures.

11:31.633 --> 11:34.270
These creatures are
going to be my wife.

11:35.103 --> 11:38.307
Well, one of those
creat-One of those...

11:38.574 --> 11:40.510
I'm engaged to Larec.

11:40.542 --> 11:44.012
Enough. Our bloodline
isn't dirty enough?

11:44.046 --> 11:46.516
You've gotta go muddy
it up with an elf.

11:46.549 --> 11:48.184
They're such small creatures.

11:48.217 --> 11:49.519
I love her!

11:49.551 --> 11:52.321
Do you love her, or do
you love the idea of her?

11:52.354 --> 11:53.555
Mother, please!

11:53.589 --> 11:55.624
I'm just trying to understand.

11:55.657 --> 11:57.359
You're trying
to change my mind.

11:57.392 --> 11:58.728
You talk about changing minds?

11:58.761 --> 12:00.329
That wood nymph has
changed you so much

12:00.363 --> 12:02.332
I don't recognize you anymore.

12:02.364 --> 12:03.599
You know what? You're right.

12:03.632 --> 12:05.401
I have changed.

12:05.434 --> 12:06.736
I grew up.

12:06.768 --> 12:10.172
I'm an adult now, and
I make my own choices.

12:10.672 --> 12:12.407
And I choose Larec.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.676
You will allow us to be wed.

12:14.709 --> 12:17.613
You're right. Your mother
and I have talked this over.

12:17.646 --> 12:21.517
And if it pleases you,
you can marry tomorrow.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.585
Thank you, father.

12:23.618 --> 12:26.723
On the Syrian
Plain, at high noon,

12:26.756 --> 12:27.557
and we'll have the Dolvarnog

12:27.589 --> 12:29.559
take care of the
rest of it.

12:29.592 --> 12:31.995
How can you blatantly
disregard my feeling, Dad?

12:32.027 --> 12:33.228
How can you
blatantly disregard

12:33.262 --> 12:35.031
your responsibility
to this family?

12:35.064 --> 12:36.699
- My responsibility?
- Yes, your responsibility!

12:36.732 --> 12:38.067
Enough.

12:38.099 --> 12:40.670
We are the last
of the Onsul clan.

12:40.703 --> 12:44.674
If you marry that elf, our
lineal rights are forfeit.

12:44.706 --> 12:46.742
We'd lose our home
and our properties

12:46.776 --> 12:48.411
and everything this
family has built

12:48.444 --> 12:50.479
for the last 14 centuries.

12:50.512 --> 12:53.682
What good are lands and
riches when your heart is dead?

12:53.715 --> 12:56.485
Son, you know the law.

12:56.518 --> 13:00.623
I cannot give my consent
until our name is secure.

13:00.656 --> 13:02.724
My word is final on this.

13:02.757 --> 13:05.060
There's always Ramicus.

13:23.112 --> 13:24.546
Fly, my dear Bee's Knees.

13:24.579 --> 13:27.716
Deliver my message to
one who can save us all.

13:28.517 --> 13:30.752
Be strong, little one,
and choose wisely.

13:30.786 --> 13:32.622
Look not only for
strength in body,

13:32.655 --> 13:34.690
but also in mind and heart.

13:36.358 --> 13:37.560
Now fly.

13:40.396 --> 13:42.732
Please, choose wisely.

13:58.647 --> 14:00.148
Good one.

14:00.181 --> 14:02.484
Let me give you an excuse
for being that ugly.

14:12.594 --> 14:14.464
Well, well, well.

14:14.762 --> 14:17.733
Once again we see
that the human race

14:17.766 --> 14:19.635
is far superior to...

14:26.742 --> 14:29.344
What do I say about the crotch?

14:30.879 --> 14:33.582
This whole area is
off limits, okay?

14:33.616 --> 14:36.552
We can't all reproduce
from a pod in the mud.

14:38.586 --> 14:42.724
I said I don't
see myself having kids,

14:42.757 --> 14:46.195
not that I want to moot
any possibility of it.

14:47.695 --> 14:49.865
Well that's a disqualification,

14:49.898 --> 14:51.600
so you got to fetch the water.

14:52.801 --> 14:54.336
Because we have a troll to
tackle near Ismar tomorrow,

14:54.369 --> 14:55.770
and I don't wanna run out again.

14:59.575 --> 15:01.777
Well, that's real mature.

15:08.483 --> 15:10.619
You sure we're
going the right way?

15:10.652 --> 15:12.522
I feel like we've
been walking forever.

15:12.555 --> 15:13.856
And I've already
eaten all my figgies.

15:13.888 --> 15:15.757
Can't believe we're
actually doing this.

15:15.791 --> 15:17.660
There's no way he's
ever gonna listen to me.

15:17.693 --> 15:19.728
I'm not tired or
anything, but I think

15:19.762 --> 15:21.531
horse needs a rest.

15:21.564 --> 15:23.632
Even if he did listen, and
there's no way we're gonna

15:23.666 --> 15:25.734
find someone that's gonna
marry that selfish slob.

15:25.767 --> 15:27.737
I wish I had a brother.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.438
I bet horse has a brother.

15:34.843 --> 15:36.613
Is that it?

15:39.614 --> 15:40.916
You think he has figgies?

15:48.857 --> 15:50.560
This is ridiculous.
There's no use.

15:50.593 --> 15:51.594
Let's go back.

15:51.627 --> 15:52.728
I don't know what
I was thinking.

15:52.761 --> 15:54.730
You were thinking about Larec.

15:54.762 --> 15:56.666
Those beautiful eyes,

15:56.699 --> 15:58.633
her perfect hair,

15:58.666 --> 16:00.636
those perky little ears.

16:00.669 --> 16:01.971
So close your eyes
and reach up there

16:02.003 --> 16:04.907
and grab those
knockers before I do.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.377
I'll do it.

16:13.248 --> 16:15.250
Besides, he's your brother.

16:15.283 --> 16:16.885
What's the worst
that can happen?

16:19.021 --> 16:20.289
Cranberry!

16:21.123 --> 16:23.626
What do
we have here?

16:23.658 --> 16:24.426
Where did this one come from?

16:25.694 --> 16:27.262
You gonna join, or just watch?

16:27.296 --> 16:28.397
Yes.

16:28.430 --> 16:30.599
Look at this little
stallion. Still a watcher?

16:30.632 --> 16:33.735
Hey, whoo, look at this.
Get off of me.

16:34.802 --> 16:36.738
Ramicus, please.

16:37.373 --> 16:38.674
What's wrong with your voice?

16:38.706 --> 16:40.308
Nothing's wrong with it.

16:40.342 --> 16:42.712
It's been a long time
since I've seen you.

16:42.744 --> 16:43.878
My voice is changed some.

16:43.911 --> 16:45.647
Hasn't been that long.

16:46.547 --> 16:48.383
But I love what we're
wearing right now.

16:48.416 --> 16:49.651
This is, is that a mini skirt?

16:49.685 --> 16:52.021
Look at those legs,
they're so smooth!

16:52.054 --> 16:54.323
Now, don't be rude. Present
me to your boyfriend.

16:54.355 --> 16:55.790
- He's not my boyf-
- I'm Samton.

16:55.824 --> 16:57.627
But don't call me Sam.

16:58.494 --> 17:00.730
Okay, Sammy.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.700
Now, what are a couple of
fancy lads like yourselves

17:04.732 --> 17:07.636
doing so far away
from Mommy and Daddy?

17:10.771 --> 17:13.040
You always did like
the little ones.

17:13.075 --> 17:14.542
Makes a lot of sense, actually.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.344
I love this woman deeply.

17:16.377 --> 17:18.781
But that don't mean squat to
dear old Papa Bear, does it?

17:18.814 --> 17:20.282
I'm afraid he's a racist.

17:20.315 --> 17:22.617
Wait til he
meet my roommate.

17:24.385 --> 17:25.654
Ork!

17:25.688 --> 17:27.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Easy, Bow Finger!

17:27.555 --> 17:29.691
Hey, calm down. We're cool.

17:30.793 --> 17:32.929
Guys, this is Shokdor.
Shokdor, this is the guys.

17:33.461 --> 17:34.363
Your roommate?

17:34.396 --> 17:36.731
Is he eating that arrow?

17:36.765 --> 17:39.602
Yeah. He's crazy, man.

17:39.634 --> 17:41.503
Don't worry about him,
He's just a little mad

17:41.536 --> 17:43.305
that he's gotta go
fetch more water now.

17:45.841 --> 17:46.876
Well, you didn't have to do

17:46.909 --> 17:49.679
your cool guy arrow catching
trick, now, did you?

17:54.450 --> 17:55.884
Okay, we got a little off track.

17:55.918 --> 17:57.585
Let me get this straight.

17:57.619 --> 17:59.322
You wanna marry this
little elf girl.

17:59.354 --> 18:02.458
But Dad won't let you because
he can't trust yours truly

18:02.490 --> 18:05.894
to marry, which I
can't say I blame him.

18:05.928 --> 18:07.662
So you show up at my
door for the first time

18:07.696 --> 18:10.032
in Lord knows how long,
flashing those tiny white teeth

18:10.065 --> 18:11.734
and those deep blue eyes,

18:11.767 --> 18:13.702
and, seriously, not
enough clothing,

18:13.736 --> 18:15.671
trying to convince me to find
any old wench with a heartbeat

18:15.703 --> 18:17.940
and enter into a monogamous
and committed relationship

18:17.972 --> 18:20.442
for the rest of my
earthly existence?

18:20.476 --> 18:22.812
Yeah, that's; yes.

18:24.412 --> 18:25.748
Gotta be patient.

18:25.780 --> 18:28.884
Gotta wait til they rub
those front legs together.

18:30.753 --> 18:33.089
What'd I tell you?

18:34.655 --> 18:36.491
Ramicus, what say you?

18:36.525 --> 18:38.761
Will you secure the Onsul name?

18:39.561 --> 18:40.996
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

18:41.028 --> 18:43.132
If you don't, I will
lose Larec forever.

18:43.164 --> 18:44.700
I'm sorry, bro.

18:44.732 --> 18:46.634
I'm not gonna endure
an eternity of nagging

18:46.668 --> 18:49.438
and micromanagement
while you disappear

18:49.470 --> 18:51.640
into the magical
Neverwood Forest

18:51.672 --> 18:55.744
with,
whatever her name is.

18:55.777 --> 18:57.680
Not my style, sorry.

18:57.712 --> 18:59.047
Well, what if you
found true love?

18:59.081 --> 19:02.017
That's funny.

19:02.049 --> 19:03.918
All right, first of all,
true love doesn't exist.

19:03.951 --> 19:06.788
Second of all, anybody who
buys into that stupid notion

19:06.822 --> 19:07.823
becomes a Dolvarnog's dinner.

19:07.855 --> 19:08.623
And thirdly...

19:08.657 --> 19:11.694
It's Dolvarnoog,
not Dolvarnog.

19:11.727 --> 19:13.661
Sounds silly when
you say it like that.

19:13.694 --> 19:14.629
What do I care?

19:14.662 --> 19:15.998
There's two dots over the "o."

19:16.030 --> 19:20.101
It makes an "oo"
sound, like Dolvanoog.

19:20.134 --> 19:22.771
Let me see, I
need to write that down.

19:22.805 --> 19:23.972
That's gonna be useful
information someday.

19:24.006 --> 19:25.107
Thank you so much.

19:25.140 --> 19:27.008
Where was I?
And third.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.611
Thirdly, thank you.

19:28.643 --> 19:29.745
Knowing his track record,

19:29.778 --> 19:31.646
I'm sure he has some real
daisies picked out for me.

19:31.680 --> 19:34.717
I happen to have some
exquisite creatures lined up.

19:34.749 --> 19:37.420
Really? Like who?

19:40.122 --> 19:41.990
Well, no one set in
stone at the moment.

19:42.024 --> 19:44.693
But we'll find you one.

19:44.726 --> 19:46.429
I'm a bounty hunter.

19:46.461 --> 19:47.595
And a busy one, at that.

19:49.797 --> 19:52.700
Lorash is an idiot,
a dead idiot.

19:52.734 --> 19:54.737
A bit of a perk.

19:54.769 --> 19:57.105
Now that he's gone,
I'll be a lot more busy.

19:58.239 --> 20:00.075
Last thing I need around
here is someone special...

20:01.008 --> 20:03.011
unless she has a
price on her head.

20:03.711 --> 20:05.680
Let's go, Samton.

20:05.713 --> 20:07.782
Told you this is a
waste of our time.

20:16.991 --> 20:19.060
Dude! I almost had it!

20:19.760 --> 20:21.129
Thing didn't even flinch.

20:25.734 --> 20:27.736
Greetings. My
name is Ennogard,

20:27.768 --> 20:30.573
prisoner of the powerful
sorcerer Lord Tensley.

20:30.605 --> 20:31.940
He's my favorite wizard ever.

20:31.973 --> 20:33.908
Once a
just and goodly man,

20:33.941 --> 20:36.978
he has now turned to the
dark arts of necromancy.

20:37.011 --> 20:38.646
- What's necromancy?
- Shhh!

20:38.680 --> 20:40.114
He demands my
hand in marriage,

20:40.148 --> 20:43.219
and in my refusal, he
has become enraged.

20:43.251 --> 20:45.787
He's lucky. She looks crazy.

20:45.821 --> 20:47.089
- Shhh!
- The recent attacks

20:47.122 --> 20:49.725
of the deadly Dolvernog
have been in his bidding.

20:49.757 --> 20:52.260
He seeks to rid
the world of love.

20:52.294 --> 20:55.097
If my messenger has
chosen to show you this,

20:55.130 --> 20:57.833
then you have been
foreordained to liberate love

20:57.865 --> 20:59.033
once and for all.

20:59.066 --> 21:01.636
You are the warrior
destined to end

21:01.670 --> 21:04.840
the tyranny of Lord Tensley
and the dreaded Dolvernog.

21:04.873 --> 21:06.040
I smell a bounty.

21:06.074 --> 21:08.276
Your task will not be easy.

21:08.309 --> 21:10.011
Your life will be at great risk.

21:10.045 --> 21:12.547
But I have faith
in your success.

21:12.581 --> 21:14.149
You must capture
the beast alive,

21:14.181 --> 21:16.818
hold him safely until sundown,

21:16.852 --> 21:19.220
and await further instructions.

21:19.254 --> 21:20.823
Hold nothing back,

21:20.855 --> 21:25.193
as this feat requires the
utmost degree of courage,

21:25.227 --> 21:28.162
bravery, and selflessness.

21:28.196 --> 21:29.598
Show me the money, lady.

21:29.631 --> 21:32.601
As I am a woman of no means,

21:32.633 --> 21:35.703
I cannot offer you a
ransom for this deed.

21:35.737 --> 21:37.273
Okay, I've heard enough.

21:37.305 --> 21:38.774
How do we shut this thing off?

21:38.806 --> 21:41.809
But, what I am
willing to offer

21:41.843 --> 21:44.747
is something that
is of great worth.

21:45.780 --> 21:47.081
Okay, I'm listening.

21:47.114 --> 21:50.786
The castle of Easton
and its surrounding lands,

21:50.818 --> 21:54.589
from the Verbane Forest
to the Anadron Sea.

21:54.623 --> 21:55.690
Now we're talking.

21:55.723 --> 21:58.059
And, above this,

21:58.794 --> 22:01.697
worth much more than
all my father's lands,

22:01.729 --> 22:04.065
I offer to the
victor in this quest

22:04.098 --> 22:08.303
my heart, my soul, and my body

22:08.336 --> 22:12.842
for time and for all eternity.

22:13.741 --> 22:16.045
The fate of my soul
and countless others

22:16.077 --> 22:18.280
depends on your success.

22:19.113 --> 22:20.848
Help me if you want to hold me.

22:20.882 --> 22:22.817
You're my only hope.

22:27.722 --> 22:29.758
Let's load the dojo wagon.

22:33.194 --> 22:34.729
Gonna need some pants.

22:47.742 --> 22:49.177
This here is my pride and joy.

22:49.210 --> 22:52.815
One of the many benefits of
having an ork for a roommate.

22:53.414 --> 22:55.216
They're natural blacksmiths, so,

22:55.249 --> 22:58.119
with Shokdor's metal skills
and my general genius,

22:58.152 --> 22:59.721
we figured out a
way to get around

22:59.755 --> 23:02.792
without the use of
pesky, finicky horses.

23:03.091 --> 23:04.927
So then why the replica?

23:05.727 --> 23:07.095
I don't know.

23:07.129 --> 23:09.765
Something to remind me of
the old chestnut and gray.

23:15.370 --> 23:17.039
Well, this net's useless.

23:17.072 --> 23:18.873
Won't the Dolvernog just
burn right through it?

23:18.907 --> 23:20.809
That's metal.

23:20.842 --> 23:23.344
It's Mithrilian alloy,
actually, so it's not too heavy.

23:23.378 --> 23:25.147
It's not as strong
as the pure stuff.

23:25.180 --> 23:26.347
With enough work,
you can cut it.

23:26.381 --> 23:27.983
But dragon fire won't melt it.

23:28.016 --> 23:29.817
How did you find
all that Mithril?

23:29.851 --> 23:31.320
Well, let's just
say that sometimes

23:31.353 --> 23:33.756
orks spend all their money
on minotaur tenderloins

23:33.788 --> 23:35.123
and orchid nectar,

23:35.157 --> 23:37.826
so they got to find other
ways to pay their rent.

23:37.859 --> 23:39.061
Like melting down your father's

23:39.094 --> 23:41.697
priceless burial
armor, for example.

23:42.296 --> 23:44.266
Yeah, we learned
our lesson?

24:17.265 --> 24:18.434
Now we're ready to hunt.

24:18.467 --> 24:19.502
Let's ride.

24:19.535 --> 24:21.970
If we hurry, we can reach
the village before dark.

24:28.309 --> 24:30.145
You've got to be kidding me!

24:31.912 --> 24:33.748
Is that an ork fart?

24:34.917 --> 24:37.886
That, my friends, is the
smell of goblins in heat.

24:37.919 --> 24:40.823
When the sun goes down,
the goblins get down.

24:40.855 --> 24:42.891
But if we just get
going, it'll probably pass.

24:42.923 --> 24:43.858
We're not going
anywhere til morning.

24:43.892 --> 24:45.994
I told Larec I'd be
there by nightfall.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.763
Hey, you wanna get tag teamed

24:47.796 --> 24:49.731
by a gang of alpha
goblins, be my guest.

24:49.765 --> 24:51.999
I'm gonna sit that one out.

24:52.033 --> 24:54.036
Patience, dear Larec.

24:54.068 --> 24:55.904
'Til morning.

24:56.371 --> 24:57.940
Phooph!

25:08.216 --> 25:10.119
Look! I think I see them!

25:10.885 --> 25:12.520
Never mind.

25:12.554 --> 25:14.857
It's just a squirrel.

25:14.890 --> 25:16.391
Just can't believe he's not back

25:16.423 --> 25:17.892
when he said he would be.

25:17.926 --> 25:20.262
Get used to
it, sweetheart.

25:21.529 --> 25:23.065
Do you think he's agreed?

25:23.097 --> 25:24.767
I do hope they return home soon.

25:24.799 --> 25:26.267
I should really
like to meet him.

25:26.301 --> 25:27.502
I wonder if he's nice.

25:27.536 --> 25:30.139
I want to call him Rammy for
short, you know, for Ramicus?

25:30.171 --> 25:33.174
I bet he's handsome,
just like Camilan.

25:33.208 --> 25:34.509
But Camilan said
he's hairy, but,

25:34.543 --> 25:36.545
you know, hairy can be handsome.

25:36.577 --> 25:38.079
What if it works
out between you two?

25:38.113 --> 25:40.114
We would be sisters,
that would be so fun.

25:40.148 --> 25:41.116
Do you like my ring?

25:41.149 --> 25:43.185
Yeah, you made it.
But it's just so pretty.

25:43.218 --> 25:44.385
Careful, darling.

25:44.419 --> 25:46.522
You must soon make your vows.

25:46.555 --> 25:48.824
Wouldn't want your
tongue to catch fire.

25:50.926 --> 25:53.095
I do hope Ramicus agrees.

25:53.929 --> 25:55.864
You're telling me.

26:09.443 --> 26:10.546
Bee's Knees!

26:11.078 --> 26:12.280
Have you good news?

26:12.314 --> 26:14.583
Quietly.

26:14.615 --> 26:18.219
Now, show me the face
of my beloved hero.

26:24.025 --> 26:26.996
I believe this is
the face you speak of.

26:28.963 --> 26:30.398
I've prepared a roast.

26:30.431 --> 26:32.101
I hope you will join me.

26:37.104 --> 26:39.874
I see your mastering
spell is improved.

26:39.908 --> 26:42.578
He was once my most
trusted messenger.

26:42.611 --> 26:45.881
He had not obeyed
by magic or force,

26:45.913 --> 26:47.882
but by love...

26:49.551 --> 26:51.921
something you will
never possess.

26:52.921 --> 26:55.290
You can forget
about the roast!

27:09.371 --> 27:11.207
Little Bee's Knees.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.977
He may have destroyed
your tiny body,

27:15.009 --> 27:18.079
but what you have
done will destroy him.

27:19.546 --> 27:21.549
Goodbye, my friend.

27:23.551 --> 27:24.887
Well done.

27:39.100 --> 27:41.236
All I'm saying is, I
was in the room, too.

27:41.268 --> 27:44.072
So mathematically, I
could be the chosen one.

27:44.104 --> 27:46.474
I don't know, Sambo. I mean,

27:46.507 --> 27:48.075
I think you two would
make a great couple.

27:48.109 --> 27:49.276
Thank you.

27:49.309 --> 27:52.113
I'm just not sure you fit
the dragonslayer archetype.

27:53.148 --> 27:56.451
Though, mathematically,
you have 25 percent chance.

27:58.319 --> 28:01.188
You're a Scrorpio. You're
not compatible with anybody.

28:02.690 --> 28:04.660
How'd that work
out for you, buddy?

28:07.728 --> 28:10.332
Sorry, ladies, but I
think Princess Dragonfly

28:10.364 --> 28:11.700
has somebody else in mind.

28:11.732 --> 28:13.601
Her name is Ennogard.

28:13.634 --> 28:15.403
Well, whatever her name is,

28:15.437 --> 28:17.606
it's not coincidence
that her pet fly

28:17.639 --> 28:19.141
chose to visit my home.

28:20.674 --> 28:22.543
You pay rent. It's my home.

28:24.211 --> 28:26.113
It makes sense that it
would choose the home

28:26.146 --> 28:29.116
of a renowned
professional bounty hunter

28:29.150 --> 28:30.384
for such a daunting task.

28:30.418 --> 28:32.286
Well, what about me?

28:32.319 --> 28:33.621
What about you?

28:33.654 --> 28:36.590
Sure, I don't slay
ferocious beasts for a living,

28:36.623 --> 28:38.626
but I've killed a few.

28:38.660 --> 28:40.461
Pretty sure that bunny rabbits

28:40.495 --> 28:43.231
don't classify as wild beasts.

28:43.264 --> 28:45.935
I am skilled in
the arts of warfare.

28:47.199 --> 28:47.201
Archery?

28:47.235 --> 28:50.339
Yes, archery. And swordplay,

28:50.372 --> 28:51.507
among other discipline.

28:51.539 --> 28:54.709
You are handy with a tiny
blade, I'll give you that.

28:54.742 --> 28:56.978
I mean, the way you
shave around the nipple,

28:57.011 --> 28:59.046
it's mesmerizing.

28:59.080 --> 29:01.516
I am in peak
physical condition.

29:01.548 --> 29:03.218
My arm strength is exemplary,

29:03.250 --> 29:05.619
and I can leg press
six and a half barrels.

29:05.652 --> 29:07.555
Come to think of it,
it's quite possible

29:07.588 --> 29:09.557
I'm the chosen hero
to slay the Dolvenog

29:09.591 --> 29:11.193
and win Ennogard's heart.

29:11.226 --> 29:12.694
Then can I have Larec?

29:12.727 --> 29:15.564
Yeah, how does your
minature-sized fiancee

29:15.596 --> 29:17.498
fit into the whole picture?

29:17.532 --> 29:21.036
I was speaking
mathematically, of course.

29:21.068 --> 29:22.570
I'm still madly in
love with Larec.

29:22.603 --> 29:23.805
I know you are, buddy.

29:23.838 --> 29:26.674
I guess it could be possible
that you're the chosen one.

29:26.708 --> 29:28.176
What can I say?

29:28.209 --> 29:29.344
I always knew the right face

29:29.376 --> 29:31.012
would change your
mind about marriage.

29:31.046 --> 29:32.748
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

29:32.780 --> 29:34.248
Who said anything
about marriage?

29:34.282 --> 29:36.551
Didn't you listen?
That's the reward.

29:36.584 --> 29:39.254
Her heart, soul and body.

29:39.286 --> 29:42.090
Well, I'm only
interested in the latter.

29:42.123 --> 29:44.226
Shokdor and Samton
can divvy up the rest.

29:44.258 --> 29:44.926
I got dibs on the heart.

29:44.959 --> 29:47.228
I called it.

29:47.261 --> 29:49.463
You don't deserve to be loved.

29:49.497 --> 29:51.333
Kinda hurts, Cami.

29:52.299 --> 29:53.300
Not really.

29:53.334 --> 29:55.637
Good one, Ramikins.

30:06.581 --> 30:08.382
They're here! I see them!

30:08.415 --> 30:09.383
They're back!

30:09.417 --> 30:10.519
And what of Ramicus?

30:10.552 --> 30:13.555
I can't tell. But
they're not alone.

30:15.390 --> 30:16.525
I'm so excited.

30:16.557 --> 30:17.725
Larec, wait!

30:17.758 --> 30:19.560
Camilan! Camilan!

30:20.761 --> 30:23.297
Larec? Larec!

30:23.331 --> 30:24.733
Wait!

30:25.632 --> 30:27.169
I'm coming, my love!

30:35.477 --> 30:36.678
Samton, get up here.

30:36.710 --> 30:38.579
Thank you, Ramicus,
I'm fine back here.

30:38.613 --> 30:40.449
I need you to drive.

30:40.481 --> 30:42.316
I can't drive.

30:43.718 --> 30:45.153
You're about to learn.

30:46.621 --> 30:47.589
I...

30:49.324 --> 30:50.659
Ramicus...

31:14.181 --> 31:15.416
Larec!

31:16.884 --> 31:18.786
My love, I have so
much to tell you.

31:18.819 --> 31:20.488
Where were you?
I was so worried.

31:20.521 --> 31:22.490
Forgive me. I came
as soon as I could.

31:22.524 --> 31:24.693
I forgive you, my sweet.

32:02.564 --> 32:03.731
There's a sword on my seat.

32:03.765 --> 32:05.633
You know the drill.

33:16.703 --> 33:17.972
I said, hold her steady.

33:18.006 --> 33:19.708
I'm not good with fake horses.

33:19.740 --> 33:21.675
What was that?

33:21.709 --> 33:23.711
Pull the lever back.

33:24.578 --> 33:25.846
Go straight.

33:29.851 --> 33:30.953
That's it!

33:31.686 --> 33:34.590
Ramicus, do something!

33:42.396 --> 33:43.698
Ramicus!

33:52.640 --> 33:54.610
There goes the after party.

34:10.792 --> 34:12.527
Little heavy
on the brake?

34:13.092 --> 34:14.695
I'm heavy.

34:14.728 --> 34:16.264
Heavy on the break.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.835
Well done, Samton.

34:23.404 --> 34:25.340
I'm so sorry, my love.

34:25.672 --> 34:29.576
When I saw your face, I
forgot all danger.

34:29.609 --> 34:32.713
Hush, now. We can't
risk another attack.

34:40.053 --> 34:42.723
The healing ring. It
will heal her, won't it?

34:42.755 --> 34:43.956
Not a wound such as this.

34:43.991 --> 34:45.527
Then can
you do it, please?

34:45.560 --> 34:46.661
Tell me you can do it.
It is grave,

34:46.694 --> 34:47.562
but it can be healed.

34:47.594 --> 34:48.696
Bless you, woman.

34:48.730 --> 34:51.666
But it will require an
ingredient not easily attained.

34:51.697 --> 34:53.033
Anything you need
I will acquire.

34:53.067 --> 34:55.036
- Even if it costs your life?
- Anything.

34:55.069 --> 34:56.103
The wound must be healed

34:56.136 --> 34:58.073
by the instrument
of its violence.

34:58.105 --> 35:00.709
- The Dolvarnog's talon?
- Yes.

35:00.741 --> 35:02.544
How's that supposed to heal
it? Doesn't make any sense.

35:02.576 --> 35:04.511
Sorcery is not
an art of logic.

35:04.544 --> 35:05.779
Thank you.

35:05.812 --> 35:07.481
But it can be done?

35:07.515 --> 35:08.917
Yes. But you must hurry.

35:08.950 --> 35:11.785
If I don't have the talon by
the sunrise after tomorrow,

35:11.819 --> 35:13.421
it will be too late.

35:13.453 --> 35:15.390
What does the sunrise have
anything to do with this?

35:15.422 --> 35:16.623
Ramicus, please!

35:16.656 --> 35:17.991
There is no time to question,

35:18.024 --> 35:19.960
only to act.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.563
I will avenge this cruelty.

35:22.596 --> 35:24.665
And I will return
to save your life.

35:24.698 --> 35:26.767
Be careful, my love.

35:27.634 --> 35:29.370
The Dolvarnog shows no mercy.

35:29.404 --> 35:30.905
And neither shall I.

35:30.937 --> 35:34.675
Take this ring.

35:35.877 --> 35:38.012
No, you need it.

35:38.044 --> 35:40.147
You need it more than I.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.649
I swear to you on our love,

35:41.681 --> 35:43.884
I will return it to
its rightful place.

35:43.917 --> 35:45.986
Goodbye, my love.

35:46.654 --> 35:48.390
Bye.

35:55.163 --> 35:56.431
Relax.

35:56.464 --> 35:57.632
I'm coming with you.

35:57.665 --> 35:58.700
You'll only slow me down.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.770
Come on. You really can't
do this without my help.

36:01.803 --> 36:04.138
This is no longer
about you and your pride.

36:04.172 --> 36:05.573
This time it's about me...

36:05.605 --> 36:06.674
And your bride?

36:06.707 --> 36:08.042
Very clever.

36:08.075 --> 36:10.411
Does everything have
to be a joke with you?

36:10.444 --> 36:12.080
Come on. I'm
just being stupid.

36:12.113 --> 36:14.549
I don't have time
for your stupidity.

36:14.582 --> 36:15.683
Yah!
Hey!

36:15.716 --> 36:17.752
Hey, don't be a fool, brother!

36:18.819 --> 36:21.390
- Camilan, wait!
- Wait!

36:25.692 --> 36:27.995
Your master is
very brave, Samton.

36:28.663 --> 36:30.665
Always has been.

36:30.698 --> 36:33.602
Very brave, and a
little bit stupid.

36:40.741 --> 36:42.677
You probably knew that.

36:44.779 --> 36:46.148
Camilan rode off alone.

36:48.549 --> 36:49.484
Northward.

36:49.517 --> 36:50.785
He must travel west.

36:50.817 --> 36:52.152
He took off before
I could tell him.

36:52.185 --> 36:54.689
He is in grave danger.

36:55.489 --> 36:57.692
- Ramicus?
- Yes, my lady.

36:57.725 --> 36:59.694
Come here, brother.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.003
Your hands are like his.

37:09.169 --> 37:10.771
But you're lonesome.

37:12.607 --> 37:16.111
Ramicus, he needs your help.

37:17.611 --> 37:21.649
He's brave, but it
overshadows his judgment.

37:22.616 --> 37:24.685
I'm afraid he
doesn't want my help.

37:25.585 --> 37:26.888
He loves you.

37:28.589 --> 37:29.991
He can't say it.

37:31.091 --> 37:33.160
I can see it in his eyes.

37:37.598 --> 37:39.534
He needs you now more than ever.

37:41.035 --> 37:42.170
Please.

37:45.705 --> 37:47.608
Now, my three
courageous fools,

37:47.642 --> 37:49.710
you embark upon a
quest to fight an evil

37:49.743 --> 37:52.846
more powerful than you
have ever imagined.

37:52.879 --> 37:54.915
All who have attempted
this suicidal task

37:54.948 --> 37:57.718
have met with death swift
and merciless below.

37:57.752 --> 37:58.652
Okay, yeah, we got it.

37:58.685 --> 38:00.020
Dangerous, thank you...

38:00.053 --> 38:02.556
I'm not finished!

38:02.589 --> 38:04.292
If you're to have any
chance of success,

38:04.325 --> 38:07.060
you must accept and
use wisely the gifts

38:07.093 --> 38:09.129
which I will bestow
on each of you.

38:09.163 --> 38:10.064
Presents!

38:10.098 --> 38:13.201
Much more than mere
presents, my boy.

38:13.234 --> 38:16.837
Samton, your soul
is loyal and true.

38:17.305 --> 38:19.040
But your body lacks the training

38:19.073 --> 38:21.875
to match its physical potential.

38:21.908 --> 38:24.745
So I entrust you with this.

38:24.779 --> 38:27.047
- Cologne?
- Hardly.

38:27.080 --> 38:30.218
This vial contains the
essence of the flying Sorin.

38:30.884 --> 38:32.319
There's not a lot in there.

38:32.352 --> 38:34.888
One drop is enough to
give you physical strength

38:34.922 --> 38:37.792
beyond your mortal composition.

38:37.825 --> 38:39.261
Use it wisely.

38:41.361 --> 38:43.196
Shokdor.

38:43.230 --> 38:44.732
As an ork, you have learned

38:44.765 --> 38:46.734
to find your way
in the darkness.

38:46.767 --> 38:48.770
But with this luminate wand,

38:48.803 --> 38:51.705
you will now know where to
turn to walk in the light.

38:52.339 --> 38:54.808
Hah! Nice glowstick.

38:56.176 --> 38:57.978
Hey, I'm sure it's
the thought that counts.

38:58.011 --> 38:59.180
To think earlier
today I longed

38:59.212 --> 39:01.082
to cradle your
head in my bosoms.

39:01.114 --> 39:03.116
- Excuse me?
- Now, dear Ramicus,

39:03.149 --> 39:06.220
Your insolence may prove
destructive in the end.

39:06.786 --> 39:08.790
But in spite of your mockery,

39:08.823 --> 39:10.792
I will not stay my gift to you.

39:16.096 --> 39:17.232
Wow.

39:18.098 --> 39:21.035
One of Camilan's
many self-portraits.

39:21.067 --> 39:22.636
Thank you.

39:22.669 --> 39:24.104
Now, where's my real gift?

39:24.138 --> 39:25.774
That is all I have for you.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.742
What am I gonna do with this?

39:28.776 --> 39:31.678
When the time is right,
you will know of its worth.

39:31.712 --> 39:33.614
Well, thanks a lot, Belvie.

39:33.647 --> 39:36.116
I mean, we're all pretty
pumped about our gifts.

39:36.149 --> 39:37.751
The guys are.

39:37.785 --> 39:40.288
I just feel really bad I
didn't get you anything.

39:40.321 --> 39:43.592
But if you'll excuse me, I
have a kid brother to save.

39:51.899 --> 39:53.634
Good journey.

39:56.803 --> 39:58.372
What do we have here?

40:00.707 --> 40:02.009
Cute love girl.

40:04.277 --> 40:06.714
Yeah.

40:07.915 --> 40:09.050
Get to it.

40:09.817 --> 40:11.119
You want some of that?

40:11.152 --> 40:12.821
Yeah? Why don't you try that?

40:13.053 --> 40:14.855
Yeah?!

40:22.228 --> 40:23.665
Tailwhip.

40:23.698 --> 40:24.665
Tailwhip!

40:24.698 --> 40:26.267
Ramicus!

40:27.801 --> 40:29.803
Fireball! Fireball!

40:31.705 --> 40:34.375
Get up! Give up!

40:35.408 --> 40:37.177
There goes the after party.

40:40.181 --> 40:43.852
Impossible!

40:53.027 --> 40:54.329
Come, horse.

40:54.861 --> 40:56.330
For Larec.

41:17.151 --> 41:19.053
Do not be frightened.
I'm nothing to fear.

41:19.085 --> 41:20.888
I heard you whimpering.

41:29.797 --> 41:31.900
I'm only here to help.

41:47.247 --> 41:50.984
Patience. It will soon
soothe, but you must wait.

41:58.225 --> 42:00.462
Looks like you had
quite the battle.

42:20.580 --> 42:23.483
Sammikins, you gotta shoot
straight with me on something.

42:23.517 --> 42:25.419
Yeah, what?

42:25.886 --> 42:27.956
How long has Camilan
been talking like that?

42:28.589 --> 42:30.357
What do you mean?

42:30.390 --> 42:34.528
You know. All
up tight and snooty,

42:34.562 --> 42:37.265
like he's got
something up his rear?

42:37.297 --> 42:42.236
You know, like, "Hey, Ramicus,
where do we find berries?"

42:42.268 --> 42:44.471
No, it's more, it's
more like, "Samton,

42:44.504 --> 42:46.140
"run your fat legs over here.

42:46.172 --> 42:47.475
"I've got work for you."

42:47.507 --> 42:48.509
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

42:48.542 --> 42:50.178
Like, his whole life, I guess.

42:50.210 --> 42:53.781
No. Trust me, that
is a new development.

42:55.448 --> 42:57.317
That is queer,
come to think of it.

42:57.350 --> 42:59.086
Yeah. It's more than queer.

42:59.620 --> 43:01.556
It's borderline creepy.

43:01.589 --> 43:03.457
I don't even know how
to broach the subject.

43:05.625 --> 43:08.129
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

43:09.096 --> 43:11.165
I can tell it's a
hot button for him.

43:11.198 --> 43:13.067
Probably best not to mention it.

43:30.250 --> 43:31.585
What is it, horse?

43:32.652 --> 43:34.388
What do you see?

43:42.596 --> 43:43.931
This is him.

43:44.364 --> 43:46.167
Hide the wagon.

43:46.200 --> 43:47.435
We go on foot from here.

43:47.468 --> 43:49.404
I hope it's not too late.

44:29.643 --> 44:31.178
Yeah.

44:31.210 --> 44:32.413
I heard it, too.

44:32.946 --> 44:34.515
Where did it come from?

44:35.582 --> 44:37.151
- Does this mean that...
- No.

44:37.183 --> 44:39.120
It's just his cloak.

44:39.152 --> 44:40.587
Doesn't mean that he's...

44:42.556 --> 44:44.058
We better hurry.

44:49.062 --> 44:49.896
Use that torch, Sam.

44:49.931 --> 44:52.600
These guys hate fire.

44:54.600 --> 44:56.336
Dibs on the queen!

45:16.323 --> 45:18.459
Shokdor,
get over here!

45:21.428 --> 45:22.563
Sorry, your highness.

45:22.596 --> 45:24.565
You're not his type.

45:28.134 --> 45:29.636
They're really pissed now.

45:40.114 --> 45:41.549
Did you see that?

45:48.055 --> 45:49.623
It went out!

45:56.296 --> 45:57.665
Relight me.

45:59.565 --> 46:00.533
It's not enough.

46:00.567 --> 46:02.236
You gotta relight it.

46:03.370 --> 46:04.505
They just go out.

46:04.538 --> 46:05.606
Nice.

46:07.140 --> 46:08.675
Where's Cam?

46:13.513 --> 46:15.082
Let's play.

48:35.656 --> 48:36.924
There goes all my essence.

48:36.957 --> 48:38.424
You drank it all?

48:38.457 --> 48:40.627
It was delicious.

48:40.660 --> 48:42.428
Good.

48:42.462 --> 48:43.864
It got a bit dicey
there for a minute.

48:45.565 --> 48:46.634
Yeah.

48:46.667 --> 48:47.835
Cam!

48:52.339 --> 48:54.341
Thank the god you're all right.

48:54.373 --> 48:56.544
Don't ever do that to me again.

48:56.576 --> 48:58.411
Why did you follow me?

48:58.444 --> 48:59.345
Well, we didn't.

48:59.379 --> 49:00.547
You know, me and the
boys, we got frisky,

49:00.580 --> 49:02.682
so we wanted to hit the forest,

49:02.716 --> 49:04.817
see if we can find
some sweet goblin love.

49:04.850 --> 49:07.587
I guess when we saw you,
we got a little jealous.

49:07.620 --> 49:08.855
I didn't ask for your help.

49:08.888 --> 49:10.390
No, you didn't.

49:10.424 --> 49:12.493
But your tiny little
miniature sweetheart did.

49:12.526 --> 49:15.629
So, how about a
little gratitude here?

49:17.263 --> 49:18.665
Know what? While you're
collecting your thoughts,

49:18.698 --> 49:20.600
why don't you pick up
the rest of your dress

49:20.634 --> 49:22.603
and come back to the
dojo wagon with us.

49:22.636 --> 49:23.837
As soon as Goblintown finds out,

49:23.870 --> 49:26.439
they're gonna be pissed that
we canceled their freak fest.

49:26.473 --> 49:28.442
Also, I murdered their queen.

49:28.475 --> 49:32.546
Now we have a rather
long, southwesterly

49:32.578 --> 49:35.850
if we wanna be anywhere
near the Dolvarnog's lair.

49:37.683 --> 49:39.286
It's Dovanoog.

50:40.946 --> 50:42.715
I don't care how
hungry you are.

50:42.748 --> 50:44.451
We're not stopping.

50:44.785 --> 50:45.786
I agree. We still
have a ways to go

50:45.819 --> 50:47.554
before we're out
of the woodlands.

50:52.426 --> 50:53.994
We're definitely
not stopping here.

50:57.596 --> 50:59.700
You know that little
elf chick of yours?

50:59.732 --> 51:01.567
Her name is Larec.

51:01.600 --> 51:03.403
Yeah, Larec.

51:03.437 --> 51:04.571
She's not bad, you know.

51:04.603 --> 51:05.672
Well, it's too
bad she doesn't like

51:05.705 --> 51:08.007
the hairy, non-committing type.

51:08.040 --> 51:10.710
No, man. It's not like
I'd ever be into her.

51:11.877 --> 51:15.615
You know, she just has
really sharp features.

51:15.649 --> 51:16.750
Which look good...

51:17.384 --> 51:18.319
on her.

51:18.352 --> 51:19.687
Well, I'm sorry you're
so repulsed by her.

51:19.719 --> 51:20.853
Come on, Cam.

51:20.886 --> 51:22.455
He didn't mean it like that.

51:22.489 --> 51:23.424
Thank you.

51:23.457 --> 51:24.659
You're welcome.

51:24.857 --> 51:25.959
What did you mean?

51:25.991 --> 51:28.629
We had a little
talk before we left.

51:28.661 --> 51:30.698
I just think she's a
good egg, that's all.

51:30.730 --> 51:32.498
What did you talk about?

51:32.531 --> 51:33.834
You, mostly.

51:34.667 --> 51:36.102
What did she say?

51:36.136 --> 51:38.639
I don't wanna bore
you with details.

51:40.774 --> 51:43.678
She said you were brave.

51:45.145 --> 51:46.480
She did?

51:54.721 --> 51:55.956
Sorry.

51:56.857 --> 51:57.925
He's not.

52:01.127 --> 52:04.531
See? You're not so terrible
at night now, are you?

52:05.464 --> 52:06.966
Unacceptable!

52:10.069 --> 52:12.538
You showed mercy to that
insufferable couple.

52:12.571 --> 52:14.073
How could you let them live?

52:15.207 --> 52:19.011
I don't care who threw what
at you, you're a dragon!

52:19.044 --> 52:21.848
Kill the warrior and
then kill the lovers.

52:23.049 --> 52:24.418
It's no matter.

52:24.451 --> 52:26.420
Just don't let it happen again.

52:26.453 --> 52:27.688
But to be sure,

52:28.154 --> 52:30.656
I'll have to realign
your loyalties.

52:31.323 --> 52:32.992
There now, be a good boy.

52:34.127 --> 52:36.797
This dose is twice as
powerful as the last.

52:36.830 --> 52:38.632
You shouldn't have
any more mishaps.

52:38.665 --> 52:39.800
No!

52:40.132 --> 52:42.102
Ennogard! It isn't safe here.

52:42.134 --> 52:43.002
You must leave at once.

52:43.035 --> 52:44.971
Let him be. He's
been harmed enough.

52:45.004 --> 52:47.740
No. You don't understand.

52:47.774 --> 52:48.909
This is for his own good.

52:48.942 --> 52:51.645
This will make it so nobody
will be able to harm him.

52:51.678 --> 52:53.647
I'm protecting him,
like a good father.

52:53.680 --> 52:56.783
No. There
must be something

52:56.817 --> 52:59.719
that I can do to
convince you otherwise.

52:59.752 --> 53:03.055
Why, good cousin,
do not tease me so.

53:03.089 --> 53:05.625
Well, he is a powerful
dragon and he is hurt.

53:05.658 --> 53:08.661
He may not react
well to such a dose.

53:08.694 --> 53:10.730
Let him heal first.

53:10.763 --> 53:12.832
But I have it all ready to go.

53:12.866 --> 53:16.670
Save it, for when
he's at full strength.

53:18.705 --> 53:21.409
Thank you. Thank you.

53:22.174 --> 53:23.877
On second thought,
perhaps I should...

53:34.053 --> 53:37.924
Well, you should go to bed.

53:37.957 --> 53:39.959
You have a long day ahead.

53:39.993 --> 53:42.962
Yes, to bed. I must...

53:44.497 --> 53:45.865
Long day.

53:59.712 --> 54:01.781
Thanks, I had to get
that taste out of my mouth.

54:05.551 --> 54:07.488
Sorry about the bruises.

54:07.953 --> 54:09.722
They're my fault, in a way.

54:11.892 --> 54:12.960
Sleep well.

54:13.926 --> 54:16.162
If all goes as hoped,
this unknown warrior

54:16.196 --> 54:17.898
will soon save us both.

54:43.122 --> 54:45.091
I think this is
the Valley of Gell.

54:45.125 --> 54:46.893
If I'm right, then
we're not too far

54:46.926 --> 54:48.227
from the Dolvarnog's lair.

54:48.261 --> 54:50.264
We should be
safe to camp here.

54:55.768 --> 54:56.669
Why are we stopping?

54:56.703 --> 54:58.238
We need food and rest.

54:58.270 --> 55:01.575
But I've, I've still
got plenty of elven bread.

55:01.607 --> 55:03.810
Let's keep going and take
the beast in its sleep.

55:03.843 --> 55:07.180
Relax. We don't know the
exact location of the lair,

55:07.212 --> 55:08.582
just the general area.

55:08.614 --> 55:10.250
I refuse to relax.

55:10.283 --> 55:12.185
This is not gonna
be an easy task.

55:12.218 --> 55:13.286
And we need to make a plan.

55:13.319 --> 55:14.354
That is the plan.

55:14.388 --> 55:16.989
Stay on the road, eat
the stinking elven bread,

55:17.022 --> 55:19.125
and take the Dolvarnog tonight.

55:19.158 --> 55:21.628
Tonight we dine in Gell!

56:15.281 --> 56:16.984
Gluttonous cretins.

56:17.017 --> 56:19.252
Don't care about
anything but themselves.

56:19.285 --> 56:20.754
Can't believe it.

56:45.344 --> 56:46.279
No.

56:47.913 --> 56:49.116
Can't be her.

56:49.783 --> 56:51.151
Of course not. It's...

56:52.185 --> 56:53.687
just a bather.

56:55.721 --> 56:58.658
Still. Can't be too sure.

57:06.031 --> 57:07.066
You all right?

57:07.701 --> 57:08.769
Hello?

57:31.890 --> 57:35.161
Camilan? Is that you?

57:36.462 --> 57:39.432
Silly boy. Why are you hiding?

57:40.799 --> 57:42.702
Come join me.

57:44.837 --> 57:47.073
My sweet love, I, I'm sorry.

57:47.107 --> 57:50.377
I shouldn't be here.
We're not yet wed. I...

57:51.877 --> 57:53.946
shouldn't see you this way.

57:55.448 --> 57:59.453
We're in love.
Isn't that enough?

58:01.321 --> 58:04.257
We're saving ourselves
for each other.

58:05.158 --> 58:06.259
Aren't we?

58:10.363 --> 58:11.765
You're kidding me.

58:19.538 --> 58:21.774
Time is running out.

58:23.143 --> 58:25.411
I don't want to wait any longer.

58:25.444 --> 58:27.780
Boy.

58:28.547 --> 58:30.116
Dear.

58:32.518 --> 58:34.321
Bathe with me.

58:34.553 --> 58:36.856
Well, I guess a small
dip wouldn't hurt, right?

58:36.890 --> 58:39.493
Be in
in a minute, my love.

58:40.393 --> 58:41.495
Get my boot off.

58:46.866 --> 58:48.736
Horse doesn't like
the bread, either.

58:52.571 --> 58:54.006
Where's Cami?

58:59.812 --> 59:03.249
Dear. Wow.

59:03.283 --> 59:04.884
You make it look so easy.

59:05.585 --> 59:08.789
So, shall we proceed
with the bath?

59:14.393 --> 59:15.529
Larec?

59:17.931 --> 59:19.399
Don't scare me.

59:21.234 --> 59:23.170
You know I don't like
being frightened.

59:26.038 --> 59:27.540
Bathe with me.

59:57.603 --> 59:59.906
Camilan, we're in love.

01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.875
Is this not enough?

01:00:05.111 --> 01:00:06.046
What happened to her?

01:00:06.078 --> 01:00:07.580
It's not your girlfriend.

01:00:07.614 --> 01:00:09.850
Look at me! That's
a water morphling.

01:00:09.882 --> 01:00:11.283
They get inside your
head and tempt you

01:00:11.317 --> 01:00:12.519
with your truest desire.

01:00:12.551 --> 01:00:15.120
No, it was Larec.
She was real.

01:00:15.154 --> 01:00:17.489
Whatever you thought
you saw wasn't real.

01:00:17.522 --> 01:00:18.624
She was singing our song.

01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:20.627
Yeah, that's right.

01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:23.330
Her talon wound
magically healed itself

01:00:23.363 --> 01:00:24.531
and she decided to celebrate

01:00:24.564 --> 01:00:26.366
with a sexy
late-night skinny dip,

01:00:26.399 --> 01:00:28.067
300 tripeds away from home.

01:00:28.100 --> 01:00:29.836
That sound more real?

01:00:30.402 --> 01:00:33.207
How could I have
been so foolish?

01:00:33.573 --> 01:00:36.877
Listen. Happens
to the best of us.

01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:39.112
These things are
masters of deception.

01:00:39.145 --> 01:00:41.047
I knew a guy one time
that was so deceived

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.482
by one of these things
that he fell in love,

01:00:43.515 --> 01:00:46.085
started a long-distance
relationship with one.

01:00:46.118 --> 01:00:48.488
For months, almost two years.

01:00:49.288 --> 01:00:51.290
It was Shokdor.

01:00:52.392 --> 01:00:53.594
Shokdor did it.

01:00:56.596 --> 01:00:58.498
Come on. Let's
get you warmed up.

01:00:59.464 --> 01:01:01.468
Hey, Cam, this one
looks like your mom.

01:01:13.946 --> 01:01:15.582
We may only get
one shot at this.

01:01:15.614 --> 01:01:17.149
Gonna make it count.

01:01:18.551 --> 01:01:20.520
We need to stay focused.

01:01:20.553 --> 01:01:22.256
We're not hunting ogres here.

01:01:22.955 --> 01:01:24.658
Why are you doing this?

01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:26.459
Have you seen Easton Castle?

01:01:27.393 --> 01:01:29.029
Bit of an upgrade
from my swamp cottage.

01:01:29.062 --> 01:01:31.163
That's the only reason?

01:01:31.196 --> 01:01:32.698
Just to increase your wealth?

01:01:32.732 --> 01:01:34.200
Between me and you,

01:01:34.232 --> 01:01:36.669
bounty hunting doesn't
pay like it used to.

01:01:37.402 --> 01:01:38.538
I really need this one.

01:01:38.571 --> 01:01:40.040
So it is all about
the money, then.

01:01:40.073 --> 01:01:42.575
Yeah. It's what I do.

01:01:42.607 --> 01:01:44.376
Being paid for
what you're good at

01:01:44.410 --> 01:01:46.312
is a fairly accepted
practice around here.

01:01:46.346 --> 01:01:48.614
Yes, but don't you
desire something more?

01:01:48.647 --> 01:01:50.182
- Like what?
- Like love.

01:01:50.216 --> 01:01:51.551
No.

01:01:51.584 --> 01:01:53.286
How do you know if
you don't even try?

01:01:53.319 --> 01:01:56.089
Love is a do or do
not. There is no try.

01:01:56.122 --> 01:01:57.556
And what of
Ennogard's promise?

01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:58.725
Here we go.

01:01:58.757 --> 01:02:01.261
If we succeed,
when we succeed,

01:02:01.294 --> 01:02:04.564
you will have the chance at
love with an amazing woman.

01:02:04.596 --> 01:02:08.435
You saw her compassion,
and her beauty is unmatched,

01:02:08.468 --> 01:02:10.536
if you're not counting
elves, of course.

01:02:10.569 --> 01:02:13.272
I understand that
love's important to you.

01:02:13.772 --> 01:02:15.575
But it isn't for me.

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:18.344
I don't have room for it,
there's no space in my life.

01:02:18.377 --> 01:02:21.580
That's just it. Love
changes your life.

01:02:21.614 --> 01:02:23.083
The moment it pricks your heart,

01:02:23.116 --> 01:02:24.751
you'll bleed a
deeper, richer red.

01:02:24.783 --> 01:02:26.752
Okay. That's...

01:02:26.785 --> 01:02:28.988
Let's not get ahead
of ourselves here.

01:02:29.022 --> 01:02:30.623
We still have to capture
the most deadly beast

01:02:30.656 --> 01:02:32.257
that I've ever seen.

01:02:32.290 --> 01:02:34.426
We can get all mushy

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:37.464
and have a beautiful elven
love circle once we're done.

01:02:37.497 --> 01:02:40.033
But for now, we don't
even have a plan.

01:02:40.065 --> 01:02:43.335
Spoken like a
true dragon warrior.

01:02:43.368 --> 01:02:46.372
Well, then, what do you suggest?

01:02:47.372 --> 01:02:49.475
Our only hope
is, we ground it,

01:02:49.509 --> 01:02:50.677
take away the sky.

01:02:50.710 --> 01:02:52.245
Trap it.

01:02:52.277 --> 01:02:54.314
We've got plenty of
netting, but the problem is,

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.482
how do you get the
drop on a giant,

01:02:56.515 --> 01:02:59.618
airborne reptile that's
got a real beef with love?

01:04:40.352 --> 01:04:41.620
This isn't working.

01:04:41.654 --> 01:04:42.655
You're not selling it.

01:04:42.687 --> 01:04:43.756
You gotta...

01:04:43.788 --> 01:04:45.325
really feel it.

01:04:46.893 --> 01:04:49.596
Please, for Larec.

01:04:49.629 --> 01:04:51.564
This is so stupid.

01:04:53.832 --> 01:04:55.134
Bless you.

01:04:57.402 --> 01:04:59.605
You're probably
allergic to this flower.

01:04:59.638 --> 01:05:00.573
I'll get it.

01:05:02.774 --> 01:05:04.576
Is that better?

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:06.478
Yeah, buddy, that's better.

01:05:18.957 --> 01:05:20.660
Don't...

01:05:20.692 --> 01:05:22.361
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me.

01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:41.680
That's it, Cam.
Keep her spinning.

01:06:19.919 --> 01:06:21.388
They did it.

01:06:42.908 --> 01:06:44.344
Die!

01:06:48.547 --> 01:06:51.918
Ramicus!
What are you doing?

01:06:51.951 --> 01:06:53.620
I was about to finish the job.

01:06:53.652 --> 01:06:56.455
The job was to
capture it. That's it.

01:06:56.489 --> 01:06:58.291
That thing almost
killed Larec.

01:06:58.323 --> 01:06:59.325
I won't let it live.

01:06:59.357 --> 01:07:00.859
The message was clear.

01:07:00.893 --> 01:07:01.828
Capture the beast,

01:07:01.861 --> 01:07:04.397
wait til sundown for
further instructions.

01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:05.897
Since when do you
care about instructions?

01:07:05.931 --> 01:07:07.033
Let's kill the thing!

01:07:07.065 --> 01:07:08.701
We'll follow
Ennogard's request.

01:07:08.734 --> 01:07:10.636
Look who suddenly
cares about Ennogard.

01:07:10.669 --> 01:07:12.471
I don't have much time left.

01:07:12.504 --> 01:07:14.306
I need that talon. Let me...

01:07:14.339 --> 01:07:16.341
We have til sunrise!

01:07:16.375 --> 01:07:17.844
We're three hours
from Belveeda's.

01:07:17.877 --> 01:07:19.645
Ennogard will tell us what
to do when she gets here.

01:07:19.678 --> 01:07:21.780
Until then, we wait.

01:07:24.783 --> 01:07:26.885
Get out of my way.

01:07:28.953 --> 01:07:32.557
Your impatience has caused
us a lot of trouble already.

01:07:32.591 --> 01:07:34.993
I will not let you
screw this up, too.

01:07:35.027 --> 01:07:38.765
I see. The pathetic,
washed-up bounty hunter

01:07:38.797 --> 01:07:41.500
will do anything for his prize,

01:07:41.533 --> 01:07:44.003
even if it's at the
risk of Larec's life.

01:07:49.341 --> 01:07:50.643
Get to the wagon.

01:07:51.410 --> 01:07:53.680
Yes, you're right. Excuse me.

01:07:53.712 --> 01:07:57.683
I forgot the age-old grand
eternal law of the universe.

01:07:57.716 --> 01:08:00.852
Big brother Ramicus
always gets his way.

01:08:00.886 --> 01:08:02.622
Well, not today.

01:08:07.893 --> 01:08:08.995
No!

01:08:16.501 --> 01:08:18.304
Shokdor, get over here!

01:09:16.895 --> 01:09:19.698
You bastard! This
is all your fault!

01:09:19.732 --> 01:09:20.667
My fault?

01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:21.834
If you would have
let me kill the beast

01:09:21.867 --> 01:09:22.702
when I had the chance...

01:09:22.734 --> 01:09:24.703
I told you to wait!

01:09:24.737 --> 01:09:26.406
We would've been heroes.

01:09:26.438 --> 01:09:29.075
I would be on my way to
see Larec with the talon.

01:09:29.108 --> 01:09:30.710
But no, you had to be in charge.

01:09:30.742 --> 01:09:32.711
You had to be in control.

01:09:32.745 --> 01:09:34.714
Now Larec's going to die,

01:09:34.746 --> 01:09:35.913
because of you.

01:09:35.947 --> 01:09:37.883
Come on, calm down. You
don't know what you're saying.

01:09:37.916 --> 01:09:40.620
You calm down, you don't
know what you're saying.

01:09:40.653 --> 01:09:42.121
Whose side are you on, anyway?

01:09:42.153 --> 01:09:43.656
You're still not calm.

01:09:43.688 --> 01:09:45.490
I should've known.

01:09:45.523 --> 01:09:46.892
The moment you laid eyes on him,

01:09:46.925 --> 01:09:49.562
he was your new
best little friend.

01:09:50.496 --> 01:09:52.564
Some servant you
turned out to be.

01:09:53.098 --> 01:09:54.667
You can have him.

01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.001
I don't want him anymore.

01:09:56.035 --> 01:09:57.437
You don't mean that.

01:09:59.839 --> 01:10:01.940
Shut up, you stupid orc!

01:10:01.974 --> 01:10:03.543
Nobody asked you.

01:10:03.576 --> 01:10:05.077
And why don't you
learn to speak English

01:10:05.109 --> 01:10:06.511
like the rest of us?

01:10:08.746 --> 01:10:11.450
I understand you're
upset right now.

01:10:11.483 --> 01:10:12.617
You need to be rational.

01:10:12.651 --> 01:10:13.852
Rational?

01:10:13.885 --> 01:10:17.223
The only thing that I love in
this world is about to die,

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:19.057
and you want me to be rational.

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:21.493
She's not dead yet.

01:10:21.527 --> 01:10:22.962
You wounded it pretty badly.

01:10:22.995 --> 01:10:25.564
We can follow the trail
of blood back to its lair

01:10:25.598 --> 01:10:27.065
and kill the Dolvarnog
once and for all.

01:10:27.099 --> 01:10:28.534
It's Dolvarnoog.

01:10:28.567 --> 01:10:30.970
You sound like an idiot
when you say it wrong.

01:10:31.002 --> 01:10:34.573
I'm an idiot? You show
up with a manservant,

01:10:34.607 --> 01:10:36.475
the hairless body of a child,

01:10:36.509 --> 01:10:39.178
and a ridiculous fake
accent, and I'm the idiot?

01:10:39.211 --> 01:10:41.614
It's not fake.

01:10:42.247 --> 01:10:43.282
You know, at some point

01:10:43.315 --> 01:10:44.951
you're gonna have to stop
pretending to be a man,

01:10:44.983 --> 01:10:46.885
and actually be one.

01:10:46.919 --> 01:10:48.653
Maybe then you can
earn the love of Larec,

01:10:48.687 --> 01:10:51.623
because right now,
you don't deserve her.

01:10:54.894 --> 01:10:56.529
I hate you.

01:11:02.233 --> 01:11:03.769
Camilan, wait.

01:11:09.108 --> 01:11:11.845
I'm sorry. He didn't mean it.

01:11:12.611 --> 01:11:14.680
All the same, I need
you to look after him.

01:11:14.712 --> 01:11:16.181
I won't be gone long.

01:11:19.084 --> 01:11:21.120
It doesn't matter
whose fault it is.

01:11:21.153 --> 01:11:23.256
All that matters is we fix it.

01:11:27.693 --> 01:11:29.195
When the fires died
and the smoke faded away,

01:11:29.228 --> 01:11:31.697
the people realized
that the humble lord

01:11:31.729 --> 01:11:34.599
was not a demon after
all, but a great hero.

01:11:34.632 --> 01:11:36.935
And his beauty...
Slower, slow.

01:11:36.969 --> 01:11:41.040
Was shouted from the rooftops.

01:11:41.072 --> 01:11:43.308
And people loved him,

01:11:43.341 --> 01:11:46.679
for he was the most
powerful sorcerer

01:11:46.711 --> 01:11:49.715
in all the land. The end.

01:11:50.715 --> 01:11:51.917
Read it again,
my dear Ennogard.

01:11:51.951 --> 01:11:53.219
But we read it twice already.

01:11:53.251 --> 01:11:54.786
Again!

01:12:11.836 --> 01:12:14.172
Back a bit soon, aren't we?

01:12:16.608 --> 01:12:17.676
What have you
done to yourself?

01:12:17.710 --> 01:12:19.212
Go to him.

01:12:30.622 --> 01:12:32.791
Ramicus,
what are you doing?

01:12:32.825 --> 01:12:34.359
I was about to finish the job.

01:12:34.393 --> 01:12:37.263
The job was
to capture it. That's it.

01:12:37.295 --> 01:12:38.897
That thing almost
killed Larec.

01:12:38.930 --> 01:12:39.998
I won't let it live.

01:12:40.032 --> 01:12:41.701
The message was clear.

01:12:41.733 --> 01:12:43.702
Capture the beast,
wait til sundown

01:12:43.736 --> 01:12:44.903
for further instructions.

01:12:44.937 --> 01:12:46.706
Since when do you
care about instructions?

01:12:46.738 --> 01:12:48.006
Let's kill the thing!

01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:49.742
I'm following
Ennogard's request.

01:13:11.697 --> 01:13:12.797
What happened?

01:13:12.831 --> 01:13:15.101
He wasn't supposed to hurt you.

01:13:15.134 --> 01:13:16.169
Something must have gone wrong.

01:13:16.202 --> 01:13:18.704
My chosen warrior could
not have been so careless.

01:13:20.171 --> 01:13:23.809
I'm sorry, but you're just
gonna have to let me help you.

01:13:25.443 --> 01:13:27.013
The message was clear.

01:13:27.045 --> 01:13:28.246
They were supposed
to keep you safe

01:13:28.279 --> 01:13:30.750
until I arrived and
could warn them of...

01:13:30.782 --> 01:13:31.651
Me?

01:13:32.350 --> 01:13:33.685
Why me?

01:13:34.886 --> 01:13:36.087
It is clear from your trickery

01:13:36.121 --> 01:13:38.757
that we should be warned of you.

01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:42.661
To think I let you
kiss these lips

01:13:42.694 --> 01:13:45.398
with that forked
tongue of yours.

01:13:45.430 --> 01:13:47.700
Please, you're hurting me.

01:13:47.733 --> 01:13:49.969
Not nearly as you
hurt me, dear cousin.

01:13:50.001 --> 01:13:52.138
That pain will soon be gone.

01:13:58.077 --> 01:13:59.679
You're all I have left.

01:14:01.846 --> 01:14:03.715
It seems now,

01:14:03.748 --> 01:14:05.017
we are more alike than ever.

01:14:05.050 --> 01:14:06.852
Let him be. He
doesn't deserve this.

01:14:06.885 --> 01:14:09.022
You betrayed him, as well.

01:14:10.255 --> 01:14:13.759
Feigning love while
hiring some idiot savage

01:14:13.791 --> 01:14:15.294
to bring us down.

01:14:15.327 --> 01:14:19.732
This, this will save him
from the pain you caused.

01:14:20.799 --> 01:14:23.301
Soon your hate of love
will make you more powerful

01:14:23.335 --> 01:14:25.404
than any beast on earth.

01:14:25.437 --> 01:14:27.840
You'll have the strength
to fly day and night.

01:14:27.872 --> 01:14:31.710
Two by two, you will eliminate
this emotional scourge

01:14:31.743 --> 01:14:33.978
from our society
once and for all.

01:14:34.011 --> 01:14:35.413
It'll never work.

01:14:35.447 --> 01:14:39.051
The pain you cause will
never heal your wounds.

01:14:39.084 --> 01:14:40.452
Perhaps.

01:14:40.486 --> 01:14:43.221
But it'll probably make me
feel a whole lot better.

01:14:43.255 --> 01:14:44.422
You don't have to do this!

01:14:44.456 --> 01:14:46.459
You leave me no choice.

01:14:48.961 --> 01:14:51.431
Even if I give myself to you?

01:14:54.299 --> 01:14:55.435
You lie.

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.335
I swear.

01:14:59.071 --> 01:15:02.742
By the love of those who
have perished for its sake.

01:15:03.442 --> 01:15:07.113
And what of this chosen
love warrior of yours?

01:15:07.145 --> 01:15:08.480
He failed me.

01:15:11.183 --> 01:15:15.721
And in doing so, he has
forfeited his calling.

01:15:17.456 --> 01:15:19.125
How am I to trust you?

01:15:20.459 --> 01:15:23.062
I promised myself

01:15:23.095 --> 01:15:26.799
to whoever was able
to end this tyranny.

01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.435
And it seems that man is you.

01:15:30.469 --> 01:15:31.703
A promise is a promise.

01:15:31.737 --> 01:15:35.141
Even though you created all
this evil in the first place.

01:15:35.174 --> 01:15:36.776
We can't all have good looks.

01:15:36.809 --> 01:15:38.210
And even though we're cousins.

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:39.410
It is very common in some cul-

01:15:39.443 --> 01:15:41.446
- Not here!

01:15:41.479 --> 01:15:43.281
All the same.

01:15:43.314 --> 01:15:46.818
It is decided. We
can wed tonight.

01:15:48.120 --> 01:15:51.524
I'll go to prepare the altar.

01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:59.464
Til then, my sweet.

01:16:14.379 --> 01:16:15.982
Thank goodness I found you.

01:16:16.581 --> 01:16:17.816
Why?

01:16:18.450 --> 01:16:20.419
Your precious new
master let you go?

01:16:20.452 --> 01:16:21.987
You're being ridiculous.

01:16:22.019 --> 01:16:23.888
- Am I?
- Yes.

01:16:23.921 --> 01:16:25.825
In all the years
as your manservant,

01:16:25.858 --> 01:16:28.227
when have I ever
breached your trust?

01:16:28.260 --> 01:16:30.162
Well, the day you
met Ramicus, I guess.

01:16:30.194 --> 01:16:32.063
Forget about Ramicus!

01:16:32.096 --> 01:16:35.835
This is about you
and me, Cam and Sam.

01:16:36.367 --> 01:16:38.004
When have I ever let you down?

01:16:39.537 --> 01:16:42.040
Who carried you in
the pitch darkness

01:16:42.073 --> 01:16:43.241
through the caverns of Ednar

01:16:43.274 --> 01:16:45.143
because you sprained your ankle?

01:16:46.144 --> 01:16:47.847
Who swam across Dead Horse Gorge

01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:49.982
carrying your chain mail
loincloth above water

01:16:50.014 --> 01:16:52.285
because you didn't
want it to get rusty?

01:16:54.553 --> 01:16:57.555
Who used up every last
drop of his essence

01:16:57.589 --> 01:17:00.559
to save you from fathering
the next goblin horde?

01:17:02.627 --> 01:17:06.364
Who's willing to
risk everything,

01:17:06.398 --> 01:17:08.400
going to the ends of the earth

01:17:08.433 --> 01:17:10.469
so that you can
fulfill your dreams

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:12.337
and marry your true love?

01:17:13.572 --> 01:17:14.507
It's you.

01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:16.975
It's you.

01:17:21.078 --> 01:17:23.482
But it's
all for nothing.

01:17:24.483 --> 01:17:26.185
I failed her, Samton.

01:17:27.051 --> 01:17:29.587
Larec will
die in the morning,

01:17:29.621 --> 01:17:31.090
and it's all my fault.

01:17:35.559 --> 01:17:37.629
I can't take you
whining anymore.

01:17:38.362 --> 01:17:39.464
- You hit me.
- Yes.

01:17:39.497 --> 01:17:41.433
And I'll hit you a
thousand times again

01:17:41.465 --> 01:17:42.600
if you don't stop crying.

01:17:42.634 --> 01:17:46.505
What would Larec do if she
heard you crying like this?

01:17:46.537 --> 01:17:48.473
She'd probably kill herself.

01:17:49.573 --> 01:17:51.542
We still have time

01:17:51.576 --> 01:17:54.480
to go get the talon
and save her life.

01:17:55.647 --> 01:17:58.117
So get your crap
together and let's go.

01:18:17.336 --> 01:18:19.605
Nonsense. You look fabulous.

01:18:21.706 --> 01:18:23.608
I'm sorry, my friend,
but it's necessary.

01:18:23.642 --> 01:18:24.977
I can't have you running off.

01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:28.647
Now. Listen here, Zaous.

01:18:29.613 --> 01:18:31.549
You must be quiet
during the ceremony.

01:18:31.582 --> 01:18:33.618
But you mustn't fall
asleep, understood?

01:18:33.652 --> 01:18:37.456
I no sleep, master.

01:18:38.689 --> 01:18:41.426
I hungry!

01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:50.036
The witness is placed.

01:18:50.434 --> 01:18:52.571
The good vicar has arrived.

01:18:53.371 --> 01:18:57.408
How lovely of you to come at
such short notice, good vicar.

01:18:57.442 --> 01:19:00.011
Nonsense. The
pleasure is all mine.

01:19:12.157 --> 01:19:13.659
The altar is
prepared, my love.

01:19:19.063 --> 01:19:20.565
What are you writing, my dear?

01:19:21.099 --> 01:19:24.569
My vows. I'm preparing my own.

01:19:24.603 --> 01:19:27.038
Yes, good.

01:19:27.605 --> 01:19:29.140
As have I.

01:19:30.341 --> 01:19:32.243
Very well. Proceed.

01:19:42.787 --> 01:19:44.522
You think he
went off this way?

01:19:46.491 --> 01:19:48.127
Okay. Yeah.

01:19:48.160 --> 01:19:49.495
You understood what he said?

01:19:49.528 --> 01:19:51.364
No, not a word.

01:19:56.134 --> 01:19:59.337
You look lovely.

01:20:01.473 --> 01:20:04.310
It's a pity Uncle
Easton isn't here today.

01:20:04.776 --> 01:20:06.545
I think he would
finally approve.

01:20:06.577 --> 01:20:09.047
Do not speak of my
father, I beg of you.

01:20:09.081 --> 01:20:11.150
Forgive me, you are right.

01:20:11.183 --> 01:20:14.520
Tonight, we focus
on you and I only.

01:20:16.154 --> 01:20:18.489
My dear? Are you all right?

01:20:18.523 --> 01:20:20.726
I don't kno-, know that I am.

01:20:21.326 --> 01:20:24.129
Well, well. It's
your wedding night.

01:20:24.162 --> 01:20:26.799
It's natural if
you're a bit nervous.

01:20:34.639 --> 01:20:36.208
Isn't love wonderful?

01:21:01.532 --> 01:21:02.767
Looks like somebody died.

01:21:02.800 --> 01:21:04.535
That's no funeral pyre.

01:21:04.568 --> 01:21:06.571
The smoke's blue.

01:21:06.604 --> 01:21:08.573
Someone's getting married.

01:21:09.306 --> 01:21:12.743
Dearly beloved, we
are gathered here today

01:21:12.777 --> 01:21:16.582
to consecrate the
matrimony of two lovers,

01:21:16.614 --> 01:21:18.483
destined to be together.

01:21:18.517 --> 01:21:21.720
Two noble families
bound together by blood

01:21:21.752 --> 01:21:25.357
shall further be bound
as the matrimonial ties

01:21:25.389 --> 01:21:28.759
weave this family
tapestry ever tighter.

01:21:28.792 --> 01:21:31.529
We welcome with greatest delight

01:21:31.563 --> 01:21:35.533
the powerful sorcerer,
the handsome and

01:21:35.567 --> 01:21:37.603
Lord Tensley.

01:21:37.635 --> 01:21:39.772
Thank you, good vicar.

01:21:40.538 --> 01:21:42.541
And we are pleased
with the presence

01:21:42.573 --> 01:21:46.611
of the ever lovely and
exquisitely voluptuous

01:21:46.644 --> 01:21:48.580
Lady Ennogard.

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:49.814
Vicar, please!
This is a wedding.

01:21:49.848 --> 01:21:51.750
Yes, of course. Forgive me.

01:21:51.782 --> 01:21:55.587
Let us proceed with
the matrimonial vows.

01:22:02.827 --> 01:22:04.597
Is it finished?

01:22:04.962 --> 01:22:06.564
I've done all I can.

01:22:07.599 --> 01:22:09.568
Now we must await
the final ingredient.

01:22:15.540 --> 01:22:17.443
What do you see
of their return?

01:22:17.876 --> 01:22:20.713
No, my dear. They've
only just begun.

01:22:21.979 --> 01:22:23.381
How do you know?

01:22:23.747 --> 01:22:25.951
I can smell danger in the air.

01:22:25.983 --> 01:22:28.353
A battle brews tonight.

01:22:28.886 --> 01:22:30.755
Are you sure it's
not just the potion?

01:22:30.788 --> 01:22:32.791
Do not repel the
remedy, my dear.

01:22:33.524 --> 01:22:34.759
Will they succeed?

01:22:36.694 --> 01:22:37.763
They must.

01:23:02.287 --> 01:23:04.590
Who puts a wedding pyre
in the middle of nowhere,

01:23:04.622 --> 01:23:06.392
on the top of a cliff?

01:23:07.759 --> 01:23:09.528
I'm not sure.

01:23:10.028 --> 01:23:11.964
I fear Ennogard
has given up hope

01:23:11.996 --> 01:23:14.332
and given in to Lord Tensley.

01:23:17.301 --> 01:23:20.805
I'm sure my hamstring is
going to pop off of my leg.

01:23:23.774 --> 01:23:25.243
Pick up the pace, Samton.

01:23:25.277 --> 01:23:26.712
We don't have much time.

01:23:27.511 --> 01:23:29.614
This I solemnly swear.

01:23:29.648 --> 01:23:33.385
As long as you stay loyally
by my side and never leave me,

01:23:33.417 --> 01:23:35.886
and never speak ill of my
deeds and never question me,

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:39.591
and always stay strictly
obedient to every word I speak

01:23:39.623 --> 01:23:41.526
as long as you shall live.

01:23:41.559 --> 01:23:43.895
Well spoken, Lord Tensley.

01:23:43.928 --> 01:23:45.863
Your devotion is unparalleled.

01:23:45.897 --> 01:23:47.666
Thank you, Father.

01:23:48.632 --> 01:23:50.535
And it is now with great honor

01:23:50.568 --> 01:23:52.437
that I pronounce you man and...

01:23:52.470 --> 01:23:53.472
Wait.

01:23:53.671 --> 01:23:55.340
What is it, my dear?

01:23:56.006 --> 01:23:57.742
I must read my vows, as well.

01:23:57.776 --> 01:24:00.412
Of course.
How silly of me.

01:24:00.444 --> 01:24:01.479
Please, my love.

01:24:01.513 --> 01:24:03.282
Proceed.

01:24:16.827 --> 01:24:20.798
I, Ennogard of Tensley,
having entered this world

01:24:20.831 --> 01:24:23.535
on the 17th day
of the 10th month

01:24:23.568 --> 01:24:26.571
of the 527th year

01:24:26.604 --> 01:24:29.508
since the reign of King Arfax,

01:24:29.541 --> 01:24:31.943
having stemmed from the lineage
of the Elders of the East,

01:24:31.975 --> 01:24:33.778
born of goodly parents

01:24:33.812 --> 01:24:35.514
and raised in the
Order of the Covenant,

01:24:35.546 --> 01:24:37.815
which, honestly, was
not my first choice,

01:24:37.849 --> 01:24:40.686
but my parents were
incredibly devout...

01:24:54.765 --> 01:24:56.634
By the time I was 12,

01:24:56.667 --> 01:25:01.674
I had already developed a
deep affinity for pygmies.

01:25:02.407 --> 01:25:04.643
I had an obsession that
drew me into their world

01:25:04.675 --> 01:25:09.680
and opened my mind to new
and amazing possibilities.

01:25:09.714 --> 01:25:13.785
It was this affection that
opened my heart to love.

01:25:13.818 --> 01:25:17.989
But, alas, I was young
and Kendric was...

01:25:18.656 --> 01:25:19.925
small.

01:25:19.957 --> 01:25:24.429
And as I grew taller,
my love for him shrank

01:25:24.729 --> 01:25:28.033
until he was just
a distant memory,

01:25:28.065 --> 01:25:31.502
forever tied to the smell
of peppertonic leaves.

01:25:31.836 --> 01:25:34.005
But leaves turn brown and rot,

01:25:34.037 --> 01:25:37.475
leaving way for new growth
and new experiences.

01:25:37.509 --> 01:25:40.846
Ennogard, please. In what
way is this part of a vow?

01:25:40.879 --> 01:25:43.648
I did not interrupt your vows.

01:25:43.680 --> 01:25:46.085
I believe you should
owe me the same respect.

01:25:47.484 --> 01:25:48.719
Thank you.

01:25:48.752 --> 01:25:52.724
Love next crossed my
path at the age of 17,

01:25:52.991 --> 01:25:57.830
as my love stars aligned
with Sir Farlath,

01:25:58.729 --> 01:26:01.733
warrior, poet and
centaur prince.

01:26:02.867 --> 01:26:03.936
Whoo!

01:26:13.711 --> 01:26:14.713
We'll have to climb.

01:26:14.746 --> 01:26:15.846
How?

01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:17.515
I mean, if there were a
ladder, I could totally do it.

01:26:17.549 --> 01:26:20.051
But, I mean, the
sun's almost gone,

01:26:20.084 --> 01:26:22.621
and I can't do anything
in the darkness.

01:26:22.653 --> 01:26:23.821
We have to find another way.

01:26:23.854 --> 01:26:25.590
There is no other way,

01:26:26.457 --> 01:26:27.526
unless you can fly.

01:26:27.559 --> 01:26:29.661
We have to figure it out.

01:26:32.630 --> 01:26:34.599
Wow. Thanks.

01:26:34.631 --> 01:26:36.000
It's Belveeda's crystal.

01:26:37.535 --> 01:26:38.670
Well, it's really
cool and everything.

01:26:38.702 --> 01:26:41.639
I just, I don't think I can
climb with only one hand.

01:26:44.876 --> 01:26:46.077
Good thinking.

01:26:46.109 --> 01:26:47.645
Let us pray.

01:26:50.849 --> 01:26:52.751
I think he wants you
to get on his back.

01:26:54.551 --> 01:26:56.587
It's over a
hundred sectors high.

01:26:56.621 --> 01:26:57.756
I don't he can carry me.

01:26:57.788 --> 01:26:59.724
Fine. I'll go.

01:27:02.993 --> 01:27:05.464
Well, Ramicus is your brother,
so you should ride him up.

01:27:06.598 --> 01:27:07.966
Do you think he
has the strength?

01:27:07.998 --> 01:27:10.068
If anyone does, it's Shokdor.

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:13.138
Shokdor, can you climb?

01:27:13.170 --> 01:27:14.605
Let's climb.

01:27:20.111 --> 01:27:21.580
Good luck, brethren.

01:27:23.281 --> 01:27:24.882
I'm gonna stick down here,

01:27:24.916 --> 01:27:26.985
and set up a base camp of sorts.

01:27:37.694 --> 01:27:39.665
Well
hur-hurry if you can.

01:27:40.532 --> 01:27:45.537
Having experienced love
in its many splendid forms,

01:27:45.569 --> 01:27:48.273
receiving love from
beings of every corner

01:27:48.305 --> 01:27:51.242
of this great earth
to its vast sea,

01:27:51.276 --> 01:27:55.080
there is one hope that remains.

01:27:55.112 --> 01:27:59.650
As I now sacrifice myself to
the life of endless subjection,

01:27:59.684 --> 01:28:02.287
I can accept my life-long
sentence with you,

01:28:02.319 --> 01:28:04.889
knowing that by doing so,

01:28:04.922 --> 01:28:09.193
I will enable others to
experience the bounteous joy

01:28:09.227 --> 01:28:11.596
and happiness that
comes from true

01:28:12.630 --> 01:28:15.100
and unselfish love.

01:28:17.702 --> 01:28:21.739
I, Ennogard of Tensley,

01:28:22.674 --> 01:28:25.676
vow to forever accept
you as my husband,

01:28:26.778 --> 01:28:29.681
as you vowed to forever
concede your war

01:28:29.714 --> 01:28:32.283
against love and
all that show it.

01:28:34.618 --> 01:28:36.688
Finished? Great!

01:28:36.720 --> 01:28:37.589
Moving right along.

01:28:37.621 --> 01:28:39.123
Marvelous.

01:28:39.157 --> 01:28:43.127
Now. As you have both
exchanged your vows

01:28:43.161 --> 01:28:45.663
and are ready to be
joined together as one,

01:28:45.697 --> 01:28:47.332
if there is any in
objection to this ordinance,

01:28:47.364 --> 01:28:50.669
let them speak now or
forever hold their peace.

01:28:50.702 --> 01:28:51.837
I object!

01:28:55.672 --> 01:28:57.642
If no one else is going to.

01:28:57.675 --> 01:28:59.745
Impossible!

01:29:01.278 --> 01:29:04.148
I told you not to do that part!

01:29:09.653 --> 01:29:12.256
Is that all you got?

01:29:12.290 --> 01:29:15.594
No, good fool, I
have not yet begun

01:29:15.626 --> 01:29:18.196
to show you the
extent of my talents.

01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:21.232
Good. Because that
last one was pretty weak.

01:29:21.264 --> 01:29:24.835
It is useless to waste
expert magic on an amateur.

01:29:24.868 --> 01:29:27.371
A simpleton must be
dealt with simply.

01:29:27.404 --> 01:29:29.306
Zaous!

01:29:29.340 --> 01:29:31.042
Tear his arms off.

01:29:38.215 --> 01:29:39.350
Big one.

01:29:55.832 --> 01:29:56.600
What was that?

01:29:58.336 --> 01:30:01.773
I was quite fond of him.

01:30:03.241 --> 01:30:05.777
And now, young Ramicus,

01:30:06.678 --> 01:30:08.779
you will die.

01:30:22.292 --> 01:30:25.029
Nice deed, Ramicus.

01:30:27.064 --> 01:30:28.666
But I'm afraid

01:30:29.367 --> 01:30:31.703
Daddy's coming.

01:30:54.325 --> 01:30:55.260
We must hurry.

01:30:55.292 --> 01:30:56.728
He's in trouble.

01:30:58.462 --> 01:30:59.797
Sorry.

01:30:59.831 --> 01:31:01.933
Just, do your best.

01:31:09.940 --> 01:31:11.742
Stop moving!

01:31:31.862 --> 01:31:34.832
Let's settle this
old school, shall we?

01:31:34.866 --> 01:31:36.468
Well, if you insist.

01:31:47.545 --> 01:31:49.181
I don't remember
that from school.

01:32:14.572 --> 01:32:16.241
Come on, come on!

01:32:32.322 --> 01:32:34.526
Objection overruled.

01:32:41.965 --> 01:32:44.169
I'm sorry about the wait.

01:34:28.706 --> 01:34:30.208
Dammit!

01:34:45.622 --> 01:34:46.456
My love!

01:34:46.489 --> 01:34:48.425
Your love is dead.

01:34:48.459 --> 01:34:51.194
With him dies all love,
as long as I shall live.

01:34:51.228 --> 01:34:53.398
No!!

01:35:29.367 --> 01:35:30.568
Well done, good hero.

01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:32.036
I'll take it from here.

01:35:38.475 --> 01:35:39.678
Sorry, sorry.

01:35:52.689 --> 01:35:54.325
Ramicus, I made it.

01:35:54.358 --> 01:35:55.593
Ramicus?

01:35:58.562 --> 01:36:00.465
Ramicus, get up! Get up!

01:36:00.497 --> 01:36:02.132
Come on, we need to finish this.

01:36:02.166 --> 01:36:03.568
Get up!

01:36:08.139 --> 01:36:10.641
No. He can't be gone.

01:36:10.674 --> 01:36:13.444
Wake up. Wake up, I need you.

01:36:14.377 --> 01:36:16.014
I can't do this alone.

01:36:16.479 --> 01:36:19.517
Please, please.

01:36:35.498 --> 01:36:38.702
You love me.

01:36:41.371 --> 01:36:42.706
I loved you, too, brother.

01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:45.743
I loved you so much.

01:36:46.477 --> 01:36:49.180
I didn't ever say,

01:36:49.212 --> 01:36:50.648
but I loved you.

01:36:59.489 --> 01:37:00.625
The ring.

01:37:08.498 --> 01:37:09.567
Come on.

01:37:22.379 --> 01:37:23.581
Hold on, brother.

01:37:23.613 --> 01:37:25.450
You're going to be okay.

01:37:26.450 --> 01:37:28.353
Will you be all right? Speak.

01:37:33.756 --> 01:37:35.393
Dear cousin,

01:37:36.227 --> 01:37:37.862
you betrayed me
for the last time.

01:37:37.894 --> 01:37:40.564
Tensley, I beg you
to show me mercy.

01:37:40.598 --> 01:37:42.500
I'm no longer
capable of mercy.

01:37:42.532 --> 01:37:44.468
But we are of the same blood.

01:37:44.501 --> 01:37:45.569
You cannot do this.

01:37:45.603 --> 01:37:47.305
Yeah? What about you?

01:37:47.337 --> 01:37:49.474
You promised to marry me
while you plotted my death.

01:37:49.506 --> 01:37:52.809
You forced me into a
love I could not abide.

01:37:52.843 --> 01:37:54.578
It was bound to fail.

01:37:54.612 --> 01:37:57.114
Love between blood
is an abomination.

01:37:57.148 --> 01:37:59.717
It is very common
in some cultures!

01:38:04.554 --> 01:38:06.823
I was merely
following my heart.

01:38:06.857 --> 01:38:09.460
Surely you cannot
punish me for that.

01:38:09.492 --> 01:38:12.596
Then you, too, must
forgive me for following mine.

01:38:12.630 --> 01:38:16.200
For my heart tells me to
make everyone feel as cold,

01:38:16.233 --> 01:38:19.604
empty and terrified as mine.

01:38:20.203 --> 01:38:21.605
This is not the answer.

01:38:22.540 --> 01:38:23.808
This is the only answer.

01:38:25.442 --> 01:38:26.478
Whoa!

01:38:27.611 --> 01:38:28.680
Come, my precious.

01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:31.848
Daddy is going to make
everything all right.

01:38:31.881 --> 01:38:33.750
- Tensley!
- Silence, woman!

01:38:33.783 --> 01:38:35.452
This no longer concerns you.

01:38:38.555 --> 01:38:40.590
There's a good boy.

01:38:40.623 --> 01:38:42.292
You have nothing to fear.

01:38:42.326 --> 01:38:44.495
This will make us more powerful

01:38:44.528 --> 01:38:45.863
than we can ever imagine.

01:38:45.895 --> 01:38:47.297
Please!

01:38:47.331 --> 01:38:49.433
We will be invincible.

01:38:49.465 --> 01:38:51.602
Who needs love when
you have such a pair?

01:38:51.635 --> 01:38:55.306
The omnipotent sorcerer
and his noble Dolvarnog.

01:38:55.339 --> 01:38:57.542
It's pronounced Dolvernoog.

01:38:58.876 --> 01:39:01.312
And you sound stupid when
you say it like that.

01:39:01.345 --> 01:39:02.480
Ramicus!

01:39:02.513 --> 01:39:03.581
Impossible. I
killed you already.

01:39:03.613 --> 01:39:06.416
Yeah, you know, that's
the funny thing about magic.

01:39:06.450 --> 01:39:07.885
You never know
what's gonna happen.

01:39:07.917 --> 01:39:08.952
No problem.

01:39:08.986 --> 01:39:10.854
Actually, this is quite fitting.

01:39:10.888 --> 01:39:13.591
You can join your pathetic
love as the latest victim

01:39:13.623 --> 01:39:16.493
of the new and very much
improved love dragon.

01:39:16.527 --> 01:39:19.230
Yeah, we'll see
about that.

01:39:20.663 --> 01:39:21.965
How are they catching these?

01:39:21.998 --> 01:39:24.501
That's the funny
thing about magic.

01:39:24.535 --> 01:39:26.636
You really don't know
what's gonna happen.

01:39:26.670 --> 01:39:28.773
Brother!

01:39:33.676 --> 01:39:35.212
How cute.

01:39:35.246 --> 01:39:36.514
The virgin and the warrior,

01:39:36.546 --> 01:39:38.549
the little family reunion.

01:39:38.581 --> 01:39:40.551
I'm afraid you're too late.

01:39:43.687 --> 01:39:47.858
It is beautiful.

01:39:48.858 --> 01:39:51.662
Witness the beast in full power.

01:39:52.763 --> 01:39:55.767
Thus begins the age of dragons,

01:39:56.532 --> 01:39:58.969
a new breed no dragon hunter

01:39:59.002 --> 01:40:01.206
or paladin can slay.

01:40:01.705 --> 01:40:03.274
Now, my precious.

01:40:03.306 --> 01:40:05.576
You shall obey my every command.

01:40:05.608 --> 01:40:08.812
Run away. You can
still save yourself.

01:40:08.845 --> 01:40:10.580
I will not leave you.

01:40:10.613 --> 01:40:13.683
Pitiful creatures,
taking refuge in love.

01:40:13.716 --> 01:40:15.585
We'll see if love
can save them now.

01:40:15.618 --> 01:40:17.520
Hear me, my beauty!

01:40:17.554 --> 01:40:21.591
Destroy once and for all the
vile creature before you,

01:40:21.625 --> 01:40:25.563
who has poisoned my heart
and become an enemy of love.

01:40:25.595 --> 01:40:26.763
Obey!

01:40:39.475 --> 01:40:41.746
Now, let's finish the job.

01:40:41.778 --> 01:40:43.513
No! No, stop.

01:40:43.546 --> 01:40:45.549
Release me.

01:40:51.322 --> 01:40:52.823
No, no, wait!

01:40:52.855 --> 01:40:54.524
No. No, it's okay.

01:40:54.558 --> 01:40:55.493
He's harmless.

01:40:55.526 --> 01:40:56.961
He just ate his master.

01:40:56.993 --> 01:40:59.496
He was only obeying
Tensley's command.

01:40:59.529 --> 01:41:01.364
Maybe I heard
wrong, but I'm pretty sure

01:41:01.398 --> 01:41:02.767
he told him to eat you.

01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:05.469
He was commanded to
destroy the creature

01:41:05.501 --> 01:41:07.404
who poisoned his heart.

01:41:07.438 --> 01:41:08.806
The enemy of love.

01:41:10.773 --> 01:41:13.611
Good boy.

01:41:14.010 --> 01:41:15.578
But what about Larec?

01:41:15.612 --> 01:41:17.614
He may look all nice
and cuddly right now.

01:41:17.648 --> 01:41:19.517
But she's about to
die because of him.

01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:20.785
It wasn't his choice.

01:41:20.818 --> 01:41:22.486
What difference does it make?

01:41:22.519 --> 01:41:24.488
Without that talon, she dies!

01:41:24.520 --> 01:41:25.555
I'm not gonna sit
here and do nothing.

01:41:25.589 --> 01:41:26.957
Camilan...

01:41:43.506 --> 01:41:44.776
Thank you.

01:41:47.111 --> 01:41:48.746
Looks like you
have your talon.

01:41:49.479 --> 01:41:50.747
Let's get you back
to your little lady.

01:41:50.781 --> 01:41:51.982
We better hurry.

01:41:52.014 --> 01:41:53.817
We only have a couple
of hours til morning.

01:41:53.850 --> 01:41:56.653
Relax. You'll get
there way before dawn.

01:41:59.857 --> 01:42:01.792
Okay. He knows exactly
where to take you.

01:42:01.825 --> 01:42:03.461
All you have to do is hold on.

01:42:03.493 --> 01:42:05.795
Okay. Just tell
him to take it easy.

01:42:05.828 --> 01:42:07.063
Let's not break any records.

01:42:07.096 --> 01:42:08.733
This is my first
time on dragon back.

01:42:08.765 --> 01:42:10.535
Let's just hope
it's not your last.

01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:12.569
I'm kidding!

01:42:12.603 --> 01:42:14.005
Some things never change.

01:42:15.005 --> 01:42:17.108
All right, wish me luck.

01:42:17.140 --> 01:42:18.808
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

01:42:18.841 --> 01:42:20.545
- See you soon.
- Wait.

01:42:21.612 --> 01:42:23.047
What now?

01:42:25.616 --> 01:42:27.651
I've been thinking about
that funny accent of yours.

01:42:27.684 --> 01:42:31.055
Ramicus, please. It just
was a stupid phase. It just...

01:42:31.087 --> 01:42:33.157
I think
it sounds really cool.

01:42:33.189 --> 01:42:34.725
Are you serious?

01:42:35.692 --> 01:42:38.562
See what I mean?
It's so regal.

01:42:38.595 --> 01:42:39.730
I think it's gonna catch on.

01:42:39.763 --> 01:42:42.667
It just feels right coming
off the tongue, you know?

01:42:43.901 --> 01:42:45.870
Thank you, brother.

01:42:46.437 --> 01:42:48.005
No. Thank you.

01:42:48.639 --> 01:42:50.775
After all, you were my gift.

01:42:52.209 --> 01:42:54.678
Speaking of gifts,
you're gonna need this.

01:42:54.711 --> 01:42:55.846
You're still planning
to go through

01:42:55.879 --> 01:42:57.180
that whole marriage thing?

01:42:57.214 --> 01:42:58.916
I most certainly will.

01:42:59.983 --> 01:43:01.786
Well, all the same.

01:43:01.818 --> 01:43:04.921
Maybe it's best you don't
invite me to the wedding.

01:43:06.523 --> 01:43:07.992
I've been known to object.

01:43:18.734 --> 01:43:21.138
Well, you know, I'm
glad that's over with.

01:43:21.170 --> 01:43:22.539
Yeah. You know, yeah.

01:43:22.572 --> 01:43:24.874
That was pretty intense
there, for a bit.

01:43:24.907 --> 01:43:26.977
Yeah. I mean,
you're telling me.

01:43:30.112 --> 01:43:31.815
- I think we should
- I was gonna ask...

01:43:32.849 --> 01:43:33.983
Sorry. you go.

01:43:34.017 --> 01:43:35.853
No. No, you go. You go.

01:43:38.121 --> 01:43:39.690
- I think we would...
- It was just that...

01:43:40.189 --> 01:43:44.461
Well. About the whole
rewards and everything.

01:43:44.894 --> 01:43:46.563
I was just doing
this for my brother.

01:43:47.630 --> 01:43:49.566
So, you know, I'll
take the castle

01:43:49.599 --> 01:43:51.669
and the lands and everything.

01:43:51.702 --> 01:43:53.704
But don't feel like you
have to follow through

01:43:53.737 --> 01:43:55.639
with the whole, you know ...,

01:43:55.671 --> 01:43:57.841
endlessly devoting
your soul to me,

01:43:57.875 --> 01:44:01.645
and also your body, to me.

01:44:01.678 --> 01:44:04.448
No. We could just be friends.

01:44:13.223 --> 01:44:14.591
Maybe take it slow?

01:44:14.625 --> 01:44:16.527
Yeah, we could do that.

01:44:20.730 --> 01:44:22.565
I'm coming for you, Larec!

01:44:22.599 --> 01:44:25.503
Go, go, go!

01:44:45.621 --> 01:44:48.558
Camilan! You've done it.

01:44:48.591 --> 01:44:50.694
No, my dear. Not yet.

01:44:56.733 --> 01:44:57.668
But now.

01:44:57.701 --> 01:45:00.237
I've missed you so much.

01:45:00.269 --> 01:45:01.237
My dear Larec.

01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:05.108
I promise you, I will
never leave your side.

01:45:05.142 --> 01:45:07.678
Not in a million
years. I will stay...

01:45:07.711 --> 01:45:09.647
I know. I know.

01:45:10.647 --> 01:45:12.082
You've done it.

01:45:12.114 --> 01:45:13.884
You've saved my life.

01:45:13.916 --> 01:45:18.255
No, my dear. We
did it. And now...

01:45:20.623 --> 01:45:23.560
to put this where
it belongs, forever.

01:45:31.602 --> 01:45:34.005
It's all right. He's harmless.

01:45:35.671 --> 01:45:38.709
Ladies, I'd like
you meet Noogie.

01:46:03.700 --> 01:46:04.702
See you in a week!

01:46:06.169 --> 01:46:07.872
Bye!

01:46:21.251 --> 01:46:21.985
Wow.

01:46:24.121 --> 01:46:26.724
I'm
married!

01:46:26.756 --> 01:46:28.157
I'm really proud of you.

01:46:28.190 --> 01:46:29.024
Really?

01:46:29.059 --> 01:46:29.993
Yeah. You just
witnessed your brother

01:46:30.026 --> 01:46:34.031
commit his entire life
and love to a woman,

01:46:34.063 --> 01:46:35.765
and you didn't make a peep.

01:46:37.067 --> 01:46:39.236
- His funeral.
- Watch it...

01:46:39.935 --> 01:46:41.738
or it might be yours.

01:46:45.709 --> 01:46:47.243
Hey guys, no fair.

01:46:47.844 --> 01:46:49.714
Let's everybody kiss!

01:47:02.925 --> 01:47:03.928
Wait!

01:47:27.751 --> 01:47:29.153
Not bad, brother.

01:47:29.185 --> 01:47:30.720
I mean, for an orc.

01:47:45.335 --> 01:47:49.073
Well, load up the dojo wagon.

01:49:11.854 --> 01:49:13.156
Bugger!

01:49:15.192 --> 01:49:17.394
These horses have a
minds of their owns!

01:49:21.130 --> 01:49:22.932
If you're looking for some
secret, hankies would do,

01:49:22.965 --> 01:49:24.801
secret alpha goblins.

01:49:25.836 --> 01:49:27.438
Shokdor's rather nice.

01:49:28.237 --> 01:49:29.472
Yeah, dude.

01:49:30.040 --> 01:49:31.942
It's, like, "Nah, who cares?"

01:49:33.009 --> 01:49:37.281
Where's, where's my top hat?

01:49:38.247 --> 01:49:39.582
You're an idiot.

01:49:50.426 --> 01:49:53.397
No, man. It's not like I
would ever be interested in her.

01:49:53.429 --> 01:49:55.965
I mean, even if I
was a creepy old guy,

01:49:55.998 --> 01:49:58.836
and I had a spell book

01:49:59.336 --> 01:50:01.371
to, blind me,

01:50:01.403 --> 01:50:05.276
of race differences and...

01:50:05.975 --> 01:50:07.076
cleanly features.

01:50:07.109 --> 01:50:08.946
Just like father.

01:50:13.916 --> 01:50:15.451
I hate wolves and arrows.

01:50:15.484 --> 01:50:16.920
I can't stand the wolves.

01:50:16.952 --> 01:50:19.255
Our asses are grasses
if we stop here.

01:50:19.288 --> 01:50:21.491
If we stop here, the
wolves are gonna bite us.

01:50:21.523 --> 01:50:24.928
We're stopping here? Grandma
Sison got eaten by a wolf.

01:50:32.402 --> 01:50:34.538
We are dining in Gell tonight!

01:50:35.205 --> 01:50:36.038
Everybody?

01:50:36.072 --> 01:50:37.274
Tonight!

01:50:37.306 --> 01:50:39.643
I said tonight, and
jinx, double jinx.

01:50:39.675 --> 01:50:42.078
I can't. She
looks just like mom.

01:50:42.112 --> 01:50:44.582
Can I call her that?

01:51:10.473 --> 01:51:12.676
Who rubs baby oil
on you every morning

01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:14.544
before he gets his own bath?

01:51:14.577 --> 01:51:17.348
Who spots you when you're
lifting your kegs in the air

01:51:18.380 --> 01:51:19.582
to get stronger?

01:51:19.616 --> 01:51:21.318
Who walks behind
you in the forest,

01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:23.319
singing your favorite tunes?

01:51:23.353 --> 01:51:24.254
You.

01:51:24.287 --> 01:51:26.455
Who takes the blame
when you pass gas?

01:51:26.488 --> 01:51:29.359
Who gets drunk so that you
can know what it feels like?

01:51:32.295 --> 01:51:33.163
Who skinny dips with you

01:51:33.196 --> 01:51:34.931
because you're too
afraid to go alone?

01:51:34.965 --> 01:51:37.100
Who draws you dirty
pictures to look at?

01:51:42.371 --> 01:51:43.640
Okay,
I'll see you guys.

01:51:44.607 --> 01:51:47.912
One second.

01:51:50.479 --> 01:51:51.514
Okay.

01:51:52.014 --> 01:51:54.517
Where'd you go?

01:51:57.319 --> 01:52:00.390
Doorman.

01:52:01.305 --> 01:52:07.901
