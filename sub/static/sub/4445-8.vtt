WEBVTT

00:01.334 --> 00:02.534
<i>- Previously on</i> the strain...

00:02.536 --> 00:04.603
- You have two bosses now:

00:04.605 --> 00:07.773
The ones at the cdc and me.

00:07.775 --> 00:10.476
- I waved that van through at
the airport after you sealed it.

00:10.478 --> 00:13.679
They paid me a little bit
of money to do 'em a favor.

00:13.681 --> 00:17.016
- I've seen 'em in the tunnels.
<i>Something big.</i>

00:17.018 --> 00:20.052
(roaring and growling)

00:20.054 --> 00:22.054
(screaming)

00:25.825 --> 00:27.559
Ok, then...

00:27.561 --> 00:29.628
- You're saying we kill
the master and that's somehow

00:29.630 --> 00:31.697
Gonna stop this plague?
- Yeah.

00:31.699 --> 00:34.633
- That makes no biological
sense! How does that work?

00:34.635 --> 00:36.835
- At every turn, everything
I said has proven to be correct.

00:36.837 --> 00:39.371
- Yes, but--
- this is no different.

00:44.377 --> 00:47.079
(gunshot)

00:47.081 --> 00:49.481
- I give you
another day of life, jew.

00:52.185 --> 00:54.153
- Are you alright?

01:02.028 --> 01:05.030
- Are you ok?
- Am I injured?

01:05.032 --> 01:09.535
No, but we have missed
our opportunity...

01:09.537 --> 01:12.538
And there will be consequences.

01:12.540 --> 01:14.206
- How did it move like that?

01:14.208 --> 01:18.010
- The vampires you've seen
before are newly formed,

01:18.012 --> 01:19.878
In the earliest stages
of maturity.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.914
- I shot him in the leg.

01:21.916 --> 01:24.083
- Had you struck bone,
it might have hobbled him.

01:24.085 --> 01:26.051
- Are you saying
gunshots don't kill them?

01:26.053 --> 01:29.455
- It's hard to wound them
fatally with a gun.

01:29.457 --> 01:31.457
<i>Strigoi</i> flesh heals rapidly,

01:31.459 --> 01:33.559
But silver burns them.

01:33.561 --> 01:35.561
It's been many, many years

01:35.563 --> 01:38.130
Since eichhorst
tasted such pain.

01:38.132 --> 01:40.132
By wounding him, we have sent

01:40.134 --> 01:42.134
The master a message.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.970
I do not think we will have
to wait long for his reply.

01:44.972 --> 01:48.140
- I really, really don't like
the sound of that.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.142
(indistinct pa system message)

01:50.144 --> 01:53.145
- Tunnels are the perfect
ecology for them, aren't they?

01:53.147 --> 01:55.481
Dank, dark, devoid of sunlight.

01:55.483 --> 01:57.449
- We already know vampires
don't like sunlight.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.984
- Not vampires, viruses.

01:58.986 --> 02:00.986
The die-off rate
for any genome-based pathogen

02:00.988 --> 02:03.055
When exposed to
direct ultraviolet light

02:03.057 --> 02:04.990
Is over 90%.

02:04.992 --> 02:06.992
- That's why
sun desiccates them.

02:06.994 --> 02:08.594
And at nighttime,
they have free reign.

02:08.596 --> 02:12.164
- It's nighttime now.
New york city is an open buffet.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.233
- Unless...

02:15.802 --> 02:19.238
...We can find a way
to simulate our own sunlight.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.582
(indistinct pa system message)

02:52.672 --> 02:55.307
- Ugh! Aaah...

02:55.309 --> 02:58.210
(soft ambient classical music)

03:34.547 --> 03:37.349
- Shit! It's closed.
(glass shattering)

03:37.351 --> 03:39.251
- Where's another
medical supply store?

03:39.253 --> 03:41.720
- Uvc light? Bushwick.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.523
- Here. Can you wait a minute?

03:44.525 --> 03:46.959
(group yelling)

03:51.030 --> 03:53.298
- Well, I guess
we're staying here.

03:55.568 --> 03:57.736
(dog barking)

04:03.109 --> 04:05.110
That window over there.

04:05.112 --> 04:07.412
- We're breaking in?

04:07.414 --> 04:10.849
We're burglars now?
- Burglars, vigilantes,

04:10.851 --> 04:12.951
Vampire killers.

04:12.953 --> 04:15.320
Add it to the list.

04:22.195 --> 04:24.196
Alright, get ready
for an alarm.

04:32.872 --> 04:35.907
- Must be a silent alarm.

04:35.909 --> 04:38.644
Hurry.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.257
(brief clank)
- hold up. Wait.

04:52.259 --> 04:55.093
You hear something?

04:55.095 --> 04:57.863
(distant helicopter whirring)
- (jim): I think it was outside.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.334
- Let's just do this
and get out of here.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.972
(click!)

05:06.974 --> 05:09.341
- Say something, so I know
you're not one of them.

05:11.077 --> 05:13.445
- You can put the gun down.

05:13.447 --> 05:15.280
We tried the door.

05:15.282 --> 05:17.282
Nobody answered.

05:17.284 --> 05:19.284
This is a legitimate
medical emergency.

05:19.286 --> 05:21.286
We broke into
requisition supplies.

05:21.288 --> 05:24.856
- Requisition, huh?

05:24.858 --> 05:26.925
You look like
a bunch of looters to me.

05:26.927 --> 05:29.795
- We're from the center for
disease control and prevention.

05:29.797 --> 05:32.464
Who are you?

05:32.466 --> 05:34.533
- I'm a looter.

05:38.604 --> 05:41.206
(theme music)

06:02.328 --> 06:04.296
- Right here.

06:04.298 --> 06:06.398
They were right here.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.868
The uvc lights, they were...
They're gone!

06:09.870 --> 06:14.072
- I guess you've seen
those sons of bitches too, huh?

06:14.074 --> 06:16.742
- Hey, what are you gonna do
with those lights?

06:16.744 --> 06:18.310
- Same thing as you, I bet.

06:18.312 --> 06:21.246
Sunlight fries
these big munchers.

06:21.248 --> 06:24.916
That means ultraviolet
radiation. Uvc light

06:24.918 --> 06:27.319
Is the strongest there is.
- We need those lamps.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.757
- You're the airplane doctor.

06:31.759 --> 06:35.494
I saw you on tv. Right? Hmm.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.763
Aren't you some kind
of dangerous criminal

06:37.765 --> 06:39.765
Or something?
- Hey, pal,

06:39.767 --> 06:41.933
The police are gonna
be here any minute.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.935
- No, they're not.

06:43.937 --> 06:46.004
I took out the phone lines
at the junction box.

06:46.006 --> 06:49.241
No alarm. Besides, by my guess,

06:49.243 --> 06:51.610
The cops have

06:51.612 --> 06:53.678
Bigger things to worry about
by now. Don't you think?

06:55.348 --> 06:58.016
Any reward for turning you in?

06:58.018 --> 07:00.051
- No, sorry.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.454
- Too bad for me.
(dog barking)

07:02.456 --> 07:04.456
Very good for you.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.458
- You, uh...

07:06.460 --> 07:08.693
Encountered these creatures?

07:08.695 --> 07:10.862
- Sort of...

07:10.864 --> 07:12.864
I exterminated a couple.

07:12.866 --> 07:16.468
- You say "exterminate"?

07:16.470 --> 07:19.271
- That's what I do, pops,
I'm a city exterminator.

07:19.273 --> 07:21.573
So the government's getting in
on the fight, huh?

07:21.575 --> 07:23.208
- Not officially.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.076
- What are you gonna do
with 12 lamps?

07:25.078 --> 07:27.446
- I'm not gonna run out
for a while.

07:27.448 --> 07:30.615
- So it's every man
for himself already?

07:30.617 --> 07:33.618
If so, then this battle
is over before it even began.

07:35.988 --> 07:37.989
- I'll tell you what...

07:37.991 --> 07:40.058
I'll give you three.

07:40.060 --> 07:43.662
- Three?
- What? Grandpa wants one?

07:47.433 --> 07:50.001
- We'll take six.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.970
(siren outside)
half.

07:54.574 --> 07:57.976
- I can survive with six.
But only six!

08:00.913 --> 08:04.015
(dog barking)

08:05.818 --> 08:08.820
- Why don't we get some phones?
Those pay-as-you-go types.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.089
- Cell phones aren't working,
something about the network.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.525
- Eventually, they'll work and
we'll need a way to communicate.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.527
- We might as well load up
on food and drinks while we can.

08:15.529 --> 08:18.330
- Let's make it quick.
- Go ahead, I'll be right along.

08:18.332 --> 08:21.132
- How did you get here, pops?

08:21.134 --> 08:24.703
- We travelled by subway
and taxi cab.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.606
- I wouldn't go back that way
if I were you.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.975
The subway tunnels,
that's where they are.

08:29.977 --> 08:33.111
Dozens of them.
- Thousands, I should think.

08:33.113 --> 08:36.715
These tunnels,
you know them well?

08:36.717 --> 08:38.517
- Very well.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.986
- (woman on tv): <i>A bizarre</i>
<i>attack at leisure horizons...</i>

08:40.988 --> 08:44.456
(indistinct reporting on tv)

08:46.993 --> 08:50.262
- â™ª here I go again
on my own â™ª

08:52.231 --> 08:57.102
â™ª going down the only road
I've ever known â™ª

08:59.205 --> 09:02.173
- (tv): <i>His son appeared...</i>
<i>- Machine is slow tonight.</i>

09:02.175 --> 09:04.042
- (tv): <i>...And viciously</i>
<i>assaulted his father</i>

09:04.044 --> 09:06.044
In a corridor outside his room.
- I know it's good.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.313
Could you please just
swipe it again?

09:08.315 --> 09:10.682
(card swipe and beep)

09:10.684 --> 09:14.653
(atm beeping)

09:14.655 --> 09:17.522
- Credit card machine's
down. Shit!

09:17.524 --> 09:19.691
I don't have any cash.

09:19.693 --> 09:22.093
- Shocking.

09:22.095 --> 09:24.195
Here.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.966
The atms are gonna be a problem
for the next few days, so...

09:29.835 --> 09:31.836
- I know that face.
What did you do,

09:31.838 --> 09:34.506
You and your crew
of weirdo hackers?

09:34.508 --> 09:36.508
- Nothing much

09:36.510 --> 09:38.443
Unless you want to use
a computer or cell phone.

09:38.445 --> 09:41.179
- Seriously?

09:41.181 --> 09:42.714
Why?

09:42.716 --> 09:45.183
- Because somebody paid me
a lot of money to do it.

09:45.185 --> 09:48.086
You used to think I was genius.
- Did I?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.923
- How may we get
in touch with you?

09:51.925 --> 09:53.959
Perhaps we can
help each other.

09:53.961 --> 09:56.528
- I work alone.

09:56.530 --> 09:59.698
- Where else have you
seen these vampires.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.233
- Vampires?
No, no, no, no, no.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.103
No. Not like dracula.
No, they don't have

10:05.105 --> 10:08.607
Any fangs or anything like that.
They're more like rat people,

10:08.609 --> 10:10.775
You know?

10:10.777 --> 10:13.111
- You'll excuse me.

10:15.114 --> 10:17.549
- He's right, you know?
- Who?

10:17.551 --> 10:19.551
- That exterminator.

10:19.553 --> 10:21.820
I grew up with
food shortages.

10:21.822 --> 10:24.222
People fighting
over goods, medicine.

10:24.224 --> 10:27.559
There's gonna be looting,
and panic, and vigilantes.

10:27.561 --> 10:31.396
- Aside from us, you mean?
(weird growling)

10:31.398 --> 10:33.231
Nora, time to go.

10:36.135 --> 10:38.370
(screaming)
- what the hell?!

10:47.346 --> 10:49.681
(low growling)

10:57.189 --> 10:59.591
Oh, my god!

10:59.593 --> 11:02.260
Crazy old man
with a bloody sword!

11:02.262 --> 11:04.696
(speaking foreign language)

11:32.692 --> 11:36.928
- Unholy filth.

11:38.164 --> 11:40.999
(she gasps.)
- (jim): Just give me that.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.368
(weird growling)

11:50.576 --> 11:53.311
- Nail gun, huh?

11:53.313 --> 11:55.580
Interesting.
(weird growling)

11:55.582 --> 11:58.750
What? You want some more? Huh?

12:00.352 --> 12:02.987
- Jim, come on, let's go!
- Screw this.

12:02.989 --> 12:04.889
- So what? You could speak
to these things?

12:04.891 --> 12:08.059
- Give me the phone!
- I have to count this first!

12:10.229 --> 12:14.232
- â™ª no more time
but here I go again â™ª

12:14.234 --> 12:15.967
- Watch out for the pump!

12:18.370 --> 12:22.073
(two gunshots)

12:22.075 --> 12:23.908
(gunshot)

12:33.419 --> 12:35.286
(jim gasping)

12:37.723 --> 12:39.090
- I need a plug!

12:39.092 --> 12:42.594
Where's the outlet?!
- Over there, but don't touch!

12:42.596 --> 12:45.363
(weird growling)

12:52.037 --> 12:53.805
- It's jammed!

12:55.040 --> 12:57.308
That's why I carry rebar.
- Wait, there's too many.

12:57.310 --> 13:00.345
I need your help.
(nail gun firing sporadically)

13:07.486 --> 13:09.821
- Now or never!

13:14.326 --> 13:16.828
Aim for their heads!
- Forgive me.

13:20.766 --> 13:23.301
(groaning)
- come on!

13:26.405 --> 13:28.640
Come on! Ah!

13:32.411 --> 13:34.646
(nail gun firing)

13:38.751 --> 13:41.419
(breathing hard)

13:43.355 --> 13:45.423
(screaming)

13:45.425 --> 13:46.391
Come on!

13:49.295 --> 13:51.329
Come on! I got him!

13:51.331 --> 13:53.731
Oh! Oh!

13:57.703 --> 13:59.404
- (abraham): Inside! Now!

14:00.973 --> 14:03.041
- Here.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.442
(gunshot)

14:04.444 --> 14:07.345
- â™ª down the only road
I've ever known â™ª

14:13.352 --> 14:16.554
(weird growling)

14:28.200 --> 14:31.269
(weird growling)

14:45.851 --> 14:48.253
- We know the light works.
- Not through glass,

14:48.255 --> 14:50.588
There's a natural uv barrier.
Filters out

14:50.590 --> 14:53.258
80 to 90% of uv radiation.
- Jim, what happened?

14:53.260 --> 14:55.894
- Scraped when
she knocked me down.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.729
- Ok. Go to the restroom,
wash it out.

14:57.731 --> 15:00.498
- Go out, all of you!
I'll call police!

15:00.500 --> 15:03.835
- Go ahead, apu!
Fire it off in there! Go deaf!

15:08.574 --> 15:11.075
(knocking)

15:13.012 --> 15:16.014
- Look, I don't want no trouble.
I'm just a working man here.

15:16.016 --> 15:18.383
You let me go,
I'm out of your hair.

15:18.385 --> 15:20.385
- We all want
to get out of here.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.754
- Why did you just lock us in?
(jim gasping)

15:22.756 --> 15:25.490
(tap water running)

15:31.430 --> 15:34.265
- Hey! Hey! What the hell
is going on?

15:34.267 --> 15:37.335
What are those things?
- <i>Strigoi.</i> Vampires.

15:39.204 --> 15:41.272
- He's kidding, right?

15:41.274 --> 15:43.341
- Does it look
like he's kidding?

15:48.414 --> 15:50.381
- Look at us.

15:50.383 --> 15:53.084
- It's us or them.
- I know.

15:53.086 --> 15:56.621
(growling)

15:58.724 --> 16:01.125
- If we charge these lamps,
we can walk out of here.

16:06.765 --> 16:10.034
(tap water running)

16:31.590 --> 16:34.192
(growling outside)

16:36.128 --> 16:39.430
- These glass windows
aren't keeping 'em out.

16:41.133 --> 16:43.835
What are they waiting for?
- Reinforcements.

16:43.837 --> 16:47.271
We have very little time.

16:47.273 --> 16:49.207
- I need the rules.

16:51.176 --> 16:55.680
What kills these things,
aside from direct sunlight?

16:55.682 --> 16:57.849
- The brainstem
must be destroyed

16:57.851 --> 17:00.685
Or severed from
the spinal cord.

17:00.687 --> 17:03.054
- So, beheading...

17:03.056 --> 17:06.124
Or rebar bashing.

17:06.126 --> 17:08.126
What about guns?

17:08.128 --> 17:11.529
- Lead rounds can maim them
if they strike bone.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.531
Flesh wounds heal without pain.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.868
Only... Silver truly...

17:16.870 --> 17:18.870
Hurts them. They fear it.

17:18.872 --> 17:22.507
- Silver sword
and silver bullet.

17:22.509 --> 17:26.044
And that nail gun
that you have there.

17:26.046 --> 17:28.046
Aside from silver nails, uh...

17:28.048 --> 17:30.048
What? Standard issue?

17:30.050 --> 17:33.151
- From home depot.

17:34.820 --> 17:36.888
- Vasiliy fet.

17:38.590 --> 17:41.559
It's good to know you.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.695
- Abraham setrakian.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.831
Pleasure.

17:50.069 --> 17:52.670
- God! 9-1-1 isn't working.
All I'm getting

17:52.672 --> 17:55.139
Are recorded messages.
- Yeah, obviously.

17:57.042 --> 18:00.545
- You did this too?
- A little less volume, please.

18:00.547 --> 18:02.847
- Oh, my god!
What have you done?!

18:02.849 --> 18:04.749
We're trapped here!
- Shut up or I'm gonna punch you

18:04.751 --> 18:06.818
In the mouth!

18:11.023 --> 18:13.057
- (ephraim): Hey, get out
of there. Need your help.

18:13.059 --> 18:16.127
- Extension cords, and food, and
hydrogen peroxide. I make list

18:16.129 --> 18:18.296
Of everything you steal!
- We're not stealing anything.

18:18.298 --> 18:21.099
- Listen everybody.
We need your help.

18:21.101 --> 18:23.434
We're doctors from the center
for disease control.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.603
There's a plague that's
spreading through new york city.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.805
- Is it a plague
or is it vampires?

18:27.807 --> 18:30.041
Because he said vampires.

18:30.043 --> 18:32.810
- It's a transformative disease

18:32.812 --> 18:35.413
That makes people predatory and
extremely dangerous, but we have

18:35.415 --> 18:37.648
An idea about how to get us
all out of here tonight.

18:37.650 --> 18:40.051
- Sorry, man. Good luck
with all that, but I got to--

18:40.053 --> 18:42.653
- You're not gonna make it.
Trust me.

18:42.655 --> 18:45.323
- (man): Trust you? I don't even
know you! How can I trust you?

18:45.325 --> 18:47.158
- (ephraim): No, please listen
to me. If you go out there,

18:47.160 --> 18:50.261
You will be killed.
- Hey! What are you doing? Stop!

18:50.263 --> 18:53.564
- Nikki, hey, don't!
- Hey!

18:53.566 --> 18:55.166
- Ah!

18:57.336 --> 18:59.370
Oh, god!

19:01.840 --> 19:03.674
(growling)

19:11.116 --> 19:14.252
- Son of a bitch.
She made it.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.954
- She ditched me.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.090
That bitch!

19:19.092 --> 19:22.793
You said not to run!
- They're not following her.

19:22.795 --> 19:25.363
(low growling)

19:29.501 --> 19:31.769
They're not here for her.

19:37.109 --> 19:40.478
- They're here for us.

19:40.480 --> 19:44.282
- "us"? Who's "us"?

19:44.284 --> 19:46.017
Not us, you!

19:46.019 --> 19:49.020
- We go to my truck.
It's right over there.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.988
- It's too far.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.024
We won't all make it.
- The bread truck's

19:53.026 --> 19:55.293
Right over there.
Anybody else wants to go now?

19:55.295 --> 19:57.328
I got plenty of room in back.
- Are you kidding? I'm in.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.330
- This is what
they thrive on:

19:59.332 --> 20:01.866
Fear, panic,

20:01.868 --> 20:04.335
Divisiveness.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.370
There's strength in numbers.

20:06.372 --> 20:09.440
We must make a plan
and act together.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.412
- I got a plan: It's called
beat 'em to the truck!

20:14.414 --> 20:18.282
Just you and me then.
You're ready?

20:22.754 --> 20:23.988
- Oh, come on!

20:35.667 --> 20:38.502
(man screaming)

20:49.348 --> 20:51.182
(vampires screaming)

20:51.184 --> 20:52.683
- Go on!

21:00.359 --> 21:03.060
- Oh, my god!
This can't be happening.

21:03.062 --> 21:06.430
- Nobody leaves
until we all leave!

21:13.372 --> 21:15.373
- Are we stuck till morning?

21:15.375 --> 21:18.843
- We won't make it till morning.
We won't even last another hour.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.883
- We won't?
- Many more will be coming.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.919
Soon, they'll swarm
and overrun us.

21:28.921 --> 21:32.390
- They can communicate
with each other now?

21:32.392 --> 21:35.426
- They're connected
to the master

21:35.428 --> 21:37.928
Who sees through
every <i>strigoi</i> eye.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.764
- He sees through them?

21:39.766 --> 21:43.401
- When will you decide
to believe me?!

21:43.403 --> 21:45.736
(growling outside)

21:54.246 --> 21:56.681
(growling)

22:00.085 --> 22:02.353
- (tv): <i>Late this afternoon,</i>
<i>the mayor again assured</i>

22:02.355 --> 22:05.423
<i>The citizens of new york city</i>
<i>that he has no intention</i>

22:05.425 --> 22:08.459
Of asking the governor for help
<i>from the national guard.</i>

22:08.461 --> 22:10.661
<i>Here's what he had to say</i>
<i>to reporters in front</i>

22:10.663 --> 22:12.496
<i>Of city hall earlier today.</i>

22:12.498 --> 22:14.865
- (mayor): <i>Our fine police</i>
<i>commissioner has assured me...</i>

22:14.867 --> 22:17.468
- Give me 25 powerball
quick picks, apu.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.370
- I am hassan.

22:19.372 --> 22:21.872
- Hassan. 25 powerball
quick picks.

22:21.874 --> 22:23.874
Make of them a winner.

22:23.876 --> 22:26.010
- Lottery machine is down.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.379
Credit card machine down.
9-1-1 down.

22:28.381 --> 22:31.449
- 50 dollars' worth
of scratch tickets then.

22:31.451 --> 22:34.151
Yeah? My luck, uh...

22:34.153 --> 22:36.354
Can only get better.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.723
- Maybe in a tight cordon
with the uvc lamps

22:38.725 --> 22:40.725
And the weapons,
we can make a break for it.

22:40.727 --> 22:42.727
- How about the other cars
in the garage?

22:42.729 --> 22:45.062
- One's got no engine,
and one's got no wheels.

22:50.402 --> 22:52.403
- I stuck around
to help. Let me know

22:52.405 --> 22:54.372
If there's anything else
I can do.

22:54.374 --> 22:57.375
- Jim, what is that?
- What?

22:57.377 --> 23:00.144
- Come here.

23:00.146 --> 23:02.213
- What?

23:04.149 --> 23:06.617
I don't like that look.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.324
Hey, careful, that will burn.
- Close your eyes.

23:13.326 --> 23:15.326
-(tv): <i>United states</i>
<i>has historically held,</i>

23:15.328 --> 23:18.596
<i>"it's none</i>
<i>of our constitutional...</i>

23:24.669 --> 23:27.004
- Alright, guys,
come on. Talk to me.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.940
- Your cheek...

23:29.942 --> 23:32.343
- Yeah, got cut.

23:34.413 --> 23:36.480
- I think you got nicked.

23:39.785 --> 23:41.952
- It's just a scrape.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.488
- Jim...
- It's a worm.

23:48.059 --> 23:51.195
I need, uh, tweezers,

23:51.197 --> 23:54.064
A lighter. And where's
that hydrogen peroxide?

23:54.066 --> 23:57.201
- Doctor, a word please.
- I need, uh,

23:57.203 --> 24:01.839
Uh, paper towels,
gloves, and, uh, a knife.

24:06.478 --> 24:07.878
- What?!

24:07.880 --> 24:10.448
- I'm gonna
cut it out of you.

24:23.161 --> 24:26.130
- What are you gonna do
with that box cutter?

24:29.000 --> 24:30.734
- (nora): Here. Drink this.

24:44.583 --> 24:46.450
The stinger must
have grazed you.

24:46.452 --> 24:48.519
Maybe that's all it takes
to transmit the parasite.

24:48.521 --> 24:50.521
- Do you feel it anywhere?

24:50.523 --> 24:54.992
- Anywhere?
I can feel it everywhere now.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.961
Am I gonna end up
like the airline pilot?

24:56.963 --> 24:58.929
- Not if we get it before.

24:58.931 --> 25:00.931
- Before what?
- Before it reproduces.

25:00.933 --> 25:03.234
(footsteps above)

25:06.538 --> 25:09.507
- They're on the roof.

25:13.211 --> 25:16.380
At the backdoor. Come on.

25:18.717 --> 25:20.718
- What do you see?
- Not too close. I don't want

25:20.720 --> 25:23.954
To dig in any deeper.
- Deep...

25:23.956 --> 25:27.124
Get it out already.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.727
- They're looking
for multiple points of ingress,

25:29.729 --> 25:31.829
Just like any other vermin.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.831
- Can you... Can you see it?

25:33.833 --> 25:35.699
I think I can feel it
around my eye now.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.635
- I'm not gonna lie to you...
- Get it out!

25:37.637 --> 25:39.904
- ...Skin on face is very thin
and it's full of nerve endings.

25:39.906 --> 25:42.206
This is gonna hurt like a bitch.
- Don't care, just get it out!

25:42.208 --> 25:44.141
Get it out!

25:44.143 --> 25:47.978
(jim screaming)

25:47.980 --> 25:50.948
(jim screaming)

25:58.323 --> 26:00.524
- Hey! How fast can we move

26:00.526 --> 26:02.726
The wheels from this car
to that one?

26:09.067 --> 26:12.903
- Ah! What's happening?
- That's it. That's it.

26:12.905 --> 26:16.073
(jim groaning)

26:16.075 --> 26:19.009
Alright, almost there.

26:19.011 --> 26:22.746
Good. Got it.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.082
Don't move, don't move.

26:28.253 --> 26:31.455
- Don't lose it.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.995
God.

26:44.135 --> 26:46.403
- Almost there.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.472
- You better hurry up.

26:50.408 --> 26:52.643
They're up to something.

26:56.414 --> 26:58.449
- It's not pretty,
but it will hold

26:58.451 --> 27:01.118
Till we get you to a hospital.

27:04.823 --> 27:07.291
(sighing)

27:09.828 --> 27:13.230
- Well, you cut my face open.

27:13.232 --> 27:15.532
- I did, didn't I?
- Yeah.

27:17.769 --> 27:19.737
I could have turned
into one of them.

27:19.739 --> 27:21.972
- Don't even think about it.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.510
- You two saved my life...

27:26.512 --> 27:29.179
My soul.

27:29.181 --> 27:31.649
Thank you.

27:33.084 --> 27:35.152
- I think we may have stumbled
onto a potential treatment here.

27:35.154 --> 27:39.123
- Early intervention protocol.
- Something new.

27:39.125 --> 27:40.824
I don't want to go so far
as to say a cure.

27:40.826 --> 27:44.161
- (hassan): Hey! Oh, god!
Someone, come quick!

27:44.163 --> 27:47.631
(roaring)
turn away!

27:47.633 --> 27:49.433
No, no!

27:49.435 --> 27:51.802
You can't come in here!

27:51.804 --> 27:53.837
Get him out!
(vampire screaming)

28:01.046 --> 28:04.148
- They're using tools now.
- Not just tools,

28:04.150 --> 28:07.518
But distraction.

28:09.287 --> 28:11.522
- What are you doing?
Wait for us.

28:14.325 --> 28:17.861
You're gonna tell me
what we're doing out here?

28:17.863 --> 28:20.798
- It's cutting off power!

28:28.039 --> 28:31.408
- That didn't stop him.
- I didn't hit him in the head!

28:31.410 --> 28:34.211
Don't distract me.

28:50.829 --> 28:53.063
(growling)

28:58.536 --> 29:01.739
- (nora): Here's some candles.

29:01.741 --> 29:04.074
- (ephraim): Hey, hassan,
give us some batteries.

29:05.443 --> 29:08.412
(glass shattering)
- (vasiliy): They're coming in!

29:08.414 --> 29:10.214
- (blonde): Someone help us!
- (nora): The garage.

29:10.216 --> 29:12.282
- (vasiliy): In you go!
- (blonde): Hey! Get in here!

29:13.785 --> 29:15.853
(woman yelling)
(vampires screaming)

29:15.855 --> 29:18.756
- The car!
I'm almost done!

29:18.758 --> 29:21.959
Somebody, block the door!

29:21.961 --> 29:25.262
- (abraham): Fall back!
Fall back!

29:36.708 --> 29:39.476
(growling)

29:47.252 --> 29:50.554
Getting 'em on all sides now!
Can't wait any longer.

29:50.556 --> 29:53.056
- How much more time do we have
left in those lamp batteries?

29:53.058 --> 29:56.059
- If we get 20 minutes out
of these things, I'll be amazed.

29:56.061 --> 29:57.995
- That means we have...

29:57.997 --> 30:00.564
20 more minutes of life,
if that.

30:00.566 --> 30:03.000
(growling)

30:03.002 --> 30:05.536
The bread truck
is our only hope.

30:06.838 --> 30:09.072
- Ok. That didn't work out
so well for the actual

30:09.074 --> 30:11.074
Bread truck driver who still has
the keys by the way.

30:11.076 --> 30:13.744
- And once you get outside
with those things,

30:13.746 --> 30:15.512
That truck is a lot farther away
than it seems.

30:15.514 --> 30:18.782
- Fine. We'll put it to a vote.
Who wants to stay and die?

30:18.784 --> 30:22.019
(growling)

30:22.021 --> 30:24.521
(loud bang)

30:24.523 --> 30:26.590
(banging)

30:28.827 --> 30:30.828
The longer we allow ourselves
to be distracted

30:30.830 --> 30:33.263
From our only goal, survival,
the more likely

30:33.265 --> 30:36.533
We are to pull short
of achieving it!

30:36.535 --> 30:38.602
Mr. Fet, you spent your life

30:38.604 --> 30:40.604
Engaging vermin in this city.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.639
Perhaps, you have
some suggestions

30:42.641 --> 30:47.077
For getting us
from here to there.

30:53.284 --> 30:55.285
- Hey, uh, what shall I do?

30:55.287 --> 30:57.354
- Take those bottles over there
and empty 'em in the bathroom.

31:06.231 --> 31:08.899
(banging)

31:08.901 --> 31:12.302
- Trying to rip off the hvac
unit and get into the venting.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.371
They're getting more lucid,
aren't they?

31:14.373 --> 31:16.807
- In one month,
they will be fully mature.

31:16.809 --> 31:20.577
- Like eichhorst?
- No, not like him.

31:20.579 --> 31:24.047
There are a few to whom
the master grants greater power.

31:24.049 --> 31:26.917
They retain parts
of their former selves.

31:29.520 --> 31:31.989
Eichhorst is one
of the chosen.

31:31.991 --> 31:34.658
Even among the <i>strigoi,</i>
<i>there is a caste system.</i>

31:36.661 --> 31:38.662
- No offense, but every time
I talk to you,

31:38.664 --> 31:40.831
I come away feeling worse.

31:40.833 --> 31:44.001
- Hassan, it's time
to come out of there, ok?

31:44.003 --> 31:46.336
Alright? You're coming with us.
- It is safe here.

31:46.338 --> 31:49.840
- Don't be a fool. You want
to die inside a cigarette box?

31:49.842 --> 31:53.410
- I stay! I wait for police!
And who pays for this?!

31:59.951 --> 32:02.352
- It's a 250$ win, alright?

32:02.354 --> 32:05.656
Keep the change,
you earned it.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.268
- Want some?

32:20.405 --> 32:23.073
Sure?
- Yeah.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.142
- Your loss.

32:28.746 --> 32:32.316
(liquid pouring into toilet)

32:32.318 --> 32:34.818
- What was your name?

32:34.820 --> 32:38.689
- Dutch. Dutch velders.
How has this happened?

32:40.491 --> 32:44.127
- There's no short answer.
Let's get this done.

32:53.938 --> 32:56.073
- Bit crazy, right?

32:56.075 --> 32:59.242
For you to save my life in here
only to get stung out there.

32:59.244 --> 33:01.979
- I think setrakian's right,
we just need to stay together.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.947
- It was inside of my face.

33:03.949 --> 33:07.684
Eph, what you did...
Was incredible.

33:07.686 --> 33:09.686
- We can talk about it later,

33:09.688 --> 33:11.254
Let's just focus
on getting out of here.

33:11.256 --> 33:13.857
- So sorry. I knew
what I was doing was wrong;

33:13.859 --> 33:15.859
I just didn't know how wrong.

33:15.861 --> 33:19.096
What to do now
is just try to go forward.

33:19.098 --> 33:22.099
- I got it and I appreciate it.

33:25.870 --> 33:27.070
- What?

33:29.607 --> 33:32.809
Are you kidding?

33:32.811 --> 33:36.113
Whatever. Everything's fine.
I don't feel anything.

33:36.115 --> 33:38.115
I can't feel anything,
it's fine.

34:01.172 --> 34:04.174
(jim gasping)

34:04.176 --> 34:06.143
Oh, shit!

34:08.046 --> 34:09.780
Oh, shit!

34:11.516 --> 34:14.651
I'm done for, aren't I?

34:14.653 --> 34:16.553
- We're gonna take you
to the hospital.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.422
We're going to give
you antiparasitics.

34:18.424 --> 34:22.092
We'll try chemo. We have a lot
of tools at our disposal.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.560
- You couldn't save
captain redfern!

34:27.198 --> 34:28.999
Oh, shit.

34:31.769 --> 34:34.271
You have to kill me.

34:36.074 --> 34:38.742
- We're not killing you.
- We don't have time for

34:38.744 --> 34:42.179
This debate. We have to go. Now!
- You have to, uh...

34:42.181 --> 34:44.714
Release me. It's
the expression, right?

34:44.716 --> 34:46.850
- That's not a solution.
- You killed the others!

34:46.852 --> 34:49.719
It was a solution for them!
- It was different.

34:49.721 --> 34:51.788
- I want to know the truth.

34:51.790 --> 34:55.392
Once I turn, I'm gonna go
after them, right?

34:55.394 --> 34:58.795
(low growling outside)
- the ones you love, yes.

35:02.200 --> 35:05.068
Cruelest feature
of this dark curse

35:05.070 --> 35:07.571
Is that the bond
that joins you in life,

35:07.573 --> 35:10.740
Human love, is corrupted
into the need to...

35:10.742 --> 35:13.243
Consume those closest to you.

35:13.245 --> 35:15.812
- Sylvia.

35:15.814 --> 35:17.848
My parents.

35:21.252 --> 35:23.286
- Don't listen to him, jim.

35:23.288 --> 35:25.322
We can fight this.
We just need

35:25.324 --> 35:27.657
To get you out of here first.
- You cannot save him!

35:27.659 --> 35:29.659
We don't have time
for this nonsense.

35:29.661 --> 35:33.063
- This is my friend!
- Exactly.

35:33.065 --> 35:35.599
So the humane thing--
- the humane thing

35:35.601 --> 35:38.235
Is to treat him!
- He comes with us!

35:38.237 --> 35:40.170
We don't have
to decide this now.

35:40.172 --> 35:44.307
- Nora... I'd rather be dead
than turn into one of them.

35:44.309 --> 35:47.511
- Your impulse is always
to save, I know.

35:47.513 --> 35:50.147
Save your friend's soul.

35:50.149 --> 35:52.382
Release him.
Do it now before he turns!

35:54.485 --> 35:56.953
- Don't listen to him, jimmy.
You know modern technology...

35:56.955 --> 35:58.855
- No, stop!
- ...Better than I do.

35:58.857 --> 36:02.692
We can help you.
(thumping and growling)

36:02.694 --> 36:05.362
- It's too late.
- No! No!

36:07.698 --> 36:09.332
- Aah!

36:17.808 --> 36:21.378
- What did you do?
Why did you do that?

36:21.380 --> 36:23.613
- Because you couldn't.

36:23.615 --> 36:26.149
- What gave you the right?!

36:26.151 --> 36:28.552
- He wanted to die,
and you were arguing

36:28.554 --> 36:30.921
When we need to be moving!

36:40.398 --> 36:42.632
- I did your friend a favor.

36:42.634 --> 36:45.202
- It was not your decision
to make!

36:52.877 --> 36:55.412
(abraham speaking
in foreign language)

37:08.759 --> 37:11.861
Jim, I'm so sorry.

37:11.863 --> 37:14.764
(thump)

37:19.670 --> 37:22.906
(banging)

37:22.908 --> 37:25.875
- Here they come.

37:25.877 --> 37:27.711
- Hassan! Last chance!

37:27.713 --> 37:30.747
(banging and growling)

37:39.056 --> 37:40.624
- Go, go!

37:45.563 --> 37:47.397
- (vasiliy): Doc!

37:47.399 --> 37:50.233
- If you get stung, I won't
hesitate to return the favor.

37:50.235 --> 37:52.602
- That's the spirit, doc.
That's the spirit.

37:54.805 --> 37:57.641
(bottle breaking)
(guns firing)

38:00.544 --> 38:02.779
Stay together!

38:02.781 --> 38:04.381
(screaming)

38:04.383 --> 38:06.816
(guns firing)

38:13.457 --> 38:15.425
I need a credit card!

38:15.427 --> 38:17.761
- You don't have a credit card?

38:17.763 --> 38:20.163
- I'm currently in dispute
over my credit limit.

38:20.165 --> 38:22.465
- Why doesn't that
surprise me?

38:24.068 --> 38:26.836
- What's your code?
- 1-1-2-1-5.

38:26.838 --> 38:28.905
(beeping)

38:31.776 --> 38:34.911
What's the hold up?!
- I'm awaiting authorization!

38:34.913 --> 38:37.580
- I, uh, I don't know how to
tell you guys this, but...

38:37.582 --> 38:39.683
- Approved!

38:43.788 --> 38:46.289
- Give me the buckets.

38:46.291 --> 38:48.925
(screaming)

38:48.927 --> 38:52.462
- Gasoline doesn't want to be a
liquid; it wants to be a vapor,

38:52.464 --> 38:54.764
So go fast, ok?
- (nora): Ok.

38:54.766 --> 38:56.766
(growling and gunshot)

38:58.869 --> 39:02.906
- Nora!
- Ok.

39:05.209 --> 39:07.744
Hold them back!
- (dutch): Hurry!

39:10.815 --> 39:12.949
- (vasiliy): Put the light
over here!

39:14.885 --> 39:17.087
Behind you!

39:19.857 --> 39:22.459
Put the light here!

39:27.898 --> 39:31.868
I got you covered here!
Over here!

39:31.870 --> 39:33.737
(weird moaning)

39:34.905 --> 39:36.840
Heads up!

39:36.842 --> 39:39.909
Doc, wake up! Let's go!

39:43.681 --> 39:44.914
Go! Go!

39:44.916 --> 39:48.251
(gunshot)

39:48.253 --> 39:50.854
Go, go, go, go!
- My light!

39:50.856 --> 39:52.255
My light went out!
- I got you!

39:52.257 --> 39:54.724
- Go, go, go!

39:58.996 --> 40:01.030
- (vasiliy): Go!

40:01.032 --> 40:03.266
Come on! Go!
- Come on!

40:03.268 --> 40:06.336
- Go!
- Go! Go, come on, go!

40:06.338 --> 40:09.572
- Yaaa!
(vampires screaming)

40:09.574 --> 40:13.176
- (dutch): Hurry! Quickly!
(gunshots)

40:15.212 --> 40:16.613
- Doc, keys!

40:22.019 --> 40:25.455
(engine revving up)

40:35.132 --> 40:37.434
(collision)

40:47.645 --> 40:49.112
(tires screeching)

41:04.428 --> 41:07.564
(distant siren)

41:07.566 --> 41:09.732
(tires screeching)

41:14.738 --> 41:18.241
(theme music)
