WEBVTT

00:03.671 --> 00:06.240
**

00:06.274 --> 00:07.508
OKAY, GUYS,

00:07.541 --> 00:09.610
YOU HAVE BEEN TRAINED
FOR ALL KINDS OF MISSIONS.

00:09.643 --> 00:12.080
BUT YOU ARE ABOUT
TO ENTER A SOUL-BRUISING,

00:12.113 --> 00:16.517
CONFIDENCE-CRUSHING
APOCALYPTICAL ENVIRONMENT:

00:16.550 --> 00:18.652
HIGH SCHOOL.

00:20.020 --> 00:23.691
ADAM, BREE, YOUR GLITCH TEST
RESULTS ARE FAIRLY STABLE.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.526
YES!
I'M GOING TO SCHOOL!

00:25.559 --> 00:26.660
I'M FAIRLY STABLE!

00:26.694 --> 00:30.431
BUT, CHASE, I AM STILL CONCERNED
ABOUT YOUR COMMANDO APP.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.633
COMMANDO APP?

00:32.665 --> 00:36.170
PUT ON SOME UNDERPANTS.
WE'RE GOING TO SCHOOL.

00:36.204 --> 00:39.540
NO, SEE, IN THE FACE
OF AN IMMINENT THREAT,

00:39.573 --> 00:41.642
CHASE'S COMMANDO
APP KICKS IN

00:41.675 --> 00:43.677
AND HE BECOMES
A FEARLESS BRUTE

00:43.711 --> 00:45.179
I LIKE TO CALL SPIKE.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.748
IT'S KINDA LIKE
A FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT THING,

00:47.781 --> 00:50.518
EXCEPT I TOOK OUT THE FLIGHT
PART, 'CAUSE, USELESS.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.619
AND I REPLACED IT

00:51.652 --> 00:53.554
WITH A TESTOSTERONE LEVEL

00:53.587 --> 00:56.357
OF LIKE A TASMANIAN
DEVIL-WOLVERINE-

00:56.390 --> 01:00.628
SHARK-LION HYBRID
THAT'S MAD.

01:02.296 --> 01:04.165
DON'T WORRY,
MR. DAVENPORT.

01:04.197 --> 01:06.634
I PROMISE THAT SPIKE
WON'T REAR HIS UGLY HEAD.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.203
OH, YEAH? YOU MEAN
LIKE LAST CHRISTMAS

01:09.237 --> 01:12.706
WHEN I MADE THE MISTAKE
OF GIVING ADAM BOXING GLOVES?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.375
( growls )

01:16.577 --> 01:20.314
ANYBODY ELSE CONFUSED ABOUT
THE DON'T-PUNCH-ME RULE?

01:25.486 --> 01:28.289
UGH. I'M STILL
COUGHING UP TINSEL.

01:29.857 --> 01:34.328
YOU KNOW,
LETTING CHASE GO TO SCHOOL,
ISN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

01:34.362 --> 01:36.597
I CAN'T RISK
SPIKE COMING OUT.

01:36.630 --> 01:40.100
OH, COME ON, BIG "D."

01:40.134 --> 01:41.769
CHASE HAS TO COME.

01:41.802 --> 01:44.104
WITH THESE GUYS,
I'LL FINALLY GET
A PRIME SPOT

01:44.138 --> 01:45.839
IN THE CAFETERIA.

01:45.873 --> 01:47.741
THAT'S RIGHT, Y'ALL.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.744
PUT ON YOUR COATS,
'CAUSE I'M ABOUT
TO RIDE YOUR TAIL!

01:52.680 --> 01:53.814
DON'T WORRY.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.250
WE'LL MAKE SURE HE STAYS
OUT OF TROUBLE, RIGHT GUYS?

01:56.284 --> 01:58.619
YEAH. IT'S ONE FOR ALL
AND ALL FOR ONE.

01:58.652 --> 02:01.555
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
YOU GUYS MAKE ME LOOK BAD,

02:01.589 --> 02:03.824
IN WHICH CASE,
I AM DROPPING YOU LAME-OS.

02:03.857 --> 02:06.594
MR. DAVENPORT,
I CAN'T MISS SCHOOL.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.696
THIS IS THE BEGINNING
OF MY ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENTS

02:08.729 --> 02:10.398
AND CAREER TRAJECTORY.

02:10.431 --> 02:13.734
I MEAN, THE ROAD TO ASTRONAUT
LAWYER HAS TO START SOMEWHERE.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.637
OKAY.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.739
BUT I BETTER NOT GET
A CALL FROM THE ART TEACHER

02:18.772 --> 02:22.710
SAYING THAT SPIKE
RIPPED OUT HER LARYNX.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.212
ACTUALLY, SHE WOULDN'T
BE ABLE TO SAY ANYTHING,

02:24.245 --> 02:26.714
BECAUSE SPIKE RIPPED
OUT HER LAR--

02:26.747 --> 02:30.451
THE POINT IS JUST KEEP
HIM OUT OF TROUBLE.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.686
HEY, LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

02:32.720 --> 02:33.721
( groans )

02:36.790 --> 02:38.759
LOOK, I'M SORRY, BUT IF HE'S
THAT CLOSE TO THE GLOVES,

02:38.792 --> 02:41.895
IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.732
Narrator:
 THE WORLD'S FIRST
 BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.700
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

02:46.734 --> 02:48.769
FASTER, SMARTER--

02:48.802 --> 02:51.505
THE NEXT GENERATION
 OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:51.539 --> 02:53.907
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

02:53.941 --> 02:56.210
**

03:29.877 --> 03:31.879
**

03:33.247 --> 03:34.948
OKAY, YOU GUYS.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.484
THAT'S PRINCIPAL PERRY.

03:36.517 --> 03:38.819
SHE HAS THE TEMPERAMENT
OF A JUNKYARD DOG

03:38.852 --> 03:40.988
STUFFED INTO A REALLY
BAD PANTSUIT.

03:42.723 --> 03:44.325
HEY, YOU!

03:44.358 --> 03:46.760
NO TONGUE RINGS IN SCHOOL!

03:46.794 --> 03:48.329
DON'T TRY TO HIDE IT.

03:48.362 --> 03:51.399
I WILL TAKE A METAL DETECTOR
TO YOUR FACE!

03:54.435 --> 03:56.970
THIS IS IT.
MY CHANCE FOR ROMANCE.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.373
ON TV, THE NEW GIRL
ALWAYS DROPS HER BOOKS

03:59.407 --> 04:01.475
AND THE CUTE GUY WITH THE
SOULFUL EYES PICKS THEM UP.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.551
OOPS! SORRY, I'M NEW.

04:12.520 --> 04:17.391
OKAY, YOUR SOCIAL LIFE
IS DETERMINED BY
WHERE YOU SIT.

04:17.425 --> 04:20.260
WE CAN'T SIT AT
THE COOL TABLE.

04:20.293 --> 04:24.532
BUT WE CAN BE
COOL TABLE ADJACENT.

04:24.565 --> 04:29.269
FYI, ADAM JUST SAT DOWN
AT THE COOL TABLE.

04:29.303 --> 04:32.005
Leo: WHAT?!

04:32.039 --> 04:33.774
HE CAN'T SIT THERE!

04:33.807 --> 04:35.275
THAT'S WHERE THE
FOOTBALL PLAYERS

04:35.309 --> 04:36.510
SIT WITH THE CHEERLEADERS.

04:36.544 --> 04:39.012
AND THEY PRIDE THEMSELVES ON
FINDING VERY CLEVER PLACES

04:39.046 --> 04:40.414
TO STUFF YOUR PUDDING CUP.

04:41.649 --> 04:44.385
THOSE GIRLS ARE
ACTUALLY TALKING TO HIM.

04:44.418 --> 04:48.389
AND THEY CAN'T TALK ABOUT
SHAPES AND COLORS FOREVER.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.458
SEE YA.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.625
NO!

04:51.659 --> 04:53.327
THE FOOTBALL PLAYERS
ARE GONNA TURN THEM

04:53.361 --> 04:55.796
INTO THE 5th FOOD GROUP.

04:55.829 --> 04:59.833
IT'S A RESCUE MISSION.
MOVE IN. MOVE IN.

04:59.867 --> 05:00.934
OH, HEY, GUYS.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.403
THESE GIRLS JUST TOLD ME

05:02.436 --> 05:03.337
WHEN THE FOOTBALL
PLAYERS GET HERE,

05:03.371 --> 05:04.605
I'M GETTING
A FREE PUDDING CUP.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.876
HI!

05:09.910 --> 05:14.314
( mumbles )
WALK AWAY.

05:14.348 --> 05:17.551
HOW'S IT GOING?

05:17.585 --> 05:19.787
YOU'RE IN GREAT DANGER.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.791
( players chanting )

05:27.428 --> 05:28.328
SORRY.fs )

05:32.766 --> 05:36.904
HEY. THAT'S MY SEAT.

05:36.937 --> 05:40.307
GET LOST BEFORE
I USE YOU LIKE A NAPKIN.

05:40.340 --> 05:41.842
CHASE, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY GO.

05:41.875 --> 05:43.811
HE'S NOT VERY ABSORBENT.

05:45.879 --> 05:49.082
OH, LOOK, A SPILL!

05:49.116 --> 05:52.620
I THINK I'M GONNA WIPE
IT UP WITH YOUR FACE.

05:52.653 --> 05:54.555
( low warbling )

05:59.427 --> 06:00.861
( deep voice )
THINK AGAIN, BUBBLENECK.

06:00.894 --> 06:04.498
I'M GONNA RIP OUT YOUR KNEECAPS
AND USE THEM AS HOCKEY PUCKS.

06:08.035 --> 06:11.371
OKAY, I DON'T MEAN
TO ALARM ANYONE,

06:11.405 --> 06:12.806
BUT I THINK
SPIKE'S BACK.

06:16.544 --> 06:19.713
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHO
YOU'RE MESSING WITH.

06:19.747 --> 06:20.781
OKAY?

06:20.814 --> 06:22.516
PUDDING CUPS!

06:22.550 --> 06:24.818
OHH, I'LL
TAKE THHEY!

06:27.154 --> 06:30.558
OOOOH!

06:35.729 --> 06:37.531
YOU'RE DEAD!

06:37.565 --> 06:39.933
( roars )

06:39.967 --> 06:42.703
YOU, OKAY, OKAY.

06:42.736 --> 06:45.806
YOU'RE LUCKY THAT WE HAVE TO GO
TO THE READING CENTER RIGHT NOW.

06:50.110 --> 06:53.113
( cheers & applause )

06:55.749 --> 06:58.418
( deep voice )
TAKE A SEAT, COMPADRES.

06:58.452 --> 07:02.556
THIS IS OUR TABLE NOW.

07:02.590 --> 07:05.626
HELLO, LADIES.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.895
YOU MAY REMEMBER
ME FROM HEALTH CLASS

07:07.928 --> 07:10.931
WHEN I PASSED OUT DURING
THE MIRACLE OF BIRTH VIDEO.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.902
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.870
**

07:18.872 --> 07:22.576
( warbling )
 HEY, DADDY'S HOME!

07:22.610 --> 07:24.878
THAT'S NEVER GONNA
STOP BEING WEIRD.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.614
I'LL BE IN THE LAB.

07:26.647 --> 07:29.082
WITH THE KIDS AT SCHOOL,
I'M GONNA GET SO MUCH WORK DONE.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.450
BUT I'M ALL ALONE.

07:30.484 --> 07:32.553
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
 GONNA PLAY WITH ME.

07:32.586 --> 07:35.589
COME ON!
 LET'S PLAY DODGE BALL!

07:35.623 --> 07:37.791
I'M A GROWN MAN,

07:37.825 --> 07:40.093
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO PLAY DODGE BALL.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.762
BESIDES, YOU CHEAT.

07:41.795 --> 07:43.531
YOU DO TOO CHEAT.

07:43.564 --> 07:45.465
DO NOT.

07:45.499 --> 07:47.901
FINE. ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL PLAY ONE GAME.

07:51.605 --> 07:54.107
EDDIE. THAT'S CHEATING.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.577
AND YOU WEREN'T EVEN TRYING.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.946
BIG CHEATER.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.450
ALL RIGHT.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.985
MAKE ROOM FOR
THE ALPHA DOGS.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.655
WOOF! WOOOF! WOOF! WOOF!

08:07.688 --> 08:10.123
OKAY. DO THAT.

08:10.157 --> 08:13.093
WAIT, IF WE'RE
THE ALPHA DOGS,

08:13.126 --> 08:14.962
THEN...

08:17.497 --> 08:19.667
OH, I LOVE THIS!

08:24.504 --> 08:25.839
( deep voice )
WHAT'S THIS?

08:25.873 --> 08:28.542
THAT'S AN ALL
ACCESS HALL PASS.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.477
YOU CAN GO ANYWHERE
YOU WANT WITH THAT.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.847
I CAN GO ANYWHERE
I WANT ALREADY.

08:33.881 --> 08:38.619
THESE, UGH,
ARE MY HALL PASSES.

08:40.921 --> 08:44.157
OKAY, IF HE STARTS OILING UP,
I'M OUT.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.496
( low warbling )

08:49.529 --> 08:52.733
( normal voice )
COMMANDO APP DISENGAGED?

08:52.766 --> 08:54.134
GUYS!

08:54.167 --> 08:56.203
WHY WAS I IN
COMMANDO MODE?

08:56.236 --> 08:58.672
I DIDN'T SEE A COMMANDO MODE.

08:58.706 --> 09:01.508
OH, THAT'S GOOD.
EVERYONE KEEP LYING.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.977
YOU GUYS WERE SUPPOSED
TO WATCH OUT FOR ME.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.846
OH, WE WATCHED
THE WHOLE THING.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.815
YOU MANHANDLED THE QUARTERBACK

09:07.848 --> 09:10.584
AND PUDDING POPPED
THE WHOLE OFFENSIVE LINE!

09:10.618 --> 09:11.752
WHAT?

09:11.785 --> 09:13.553
AW, GREAT.

09:13.587 --> 09:14.888
THIS IS SO GONNA
COME BACK TO HAUNT

09:14.922 --> 09:17.725
MY SUPREME COURT
NOMINATION.

09:17.758 --> 09:20.594
YOU KNOW WHAT SPIKE WOULD
SAY TO THAT? NOTHING.

09:20.628 --> 09:23.030
HE'D RIP OUT YOUR RIB CAGE
AND PLAY IT LIKE A XYLOPHONE.

09:24.632 --> 09:26.533
YEAH, I LIKE HIM.

09:26.566 --> 09:31.238
HE'S LIKE A BIG, FUN MONSTER,
AND YOU'RE A SAD LITTLE BUDDY.

09:31.271 --> 09:33.941
I'LL GET SPIKE BACK.

09:33.974 --> 09:36.777
GET LOST BEFORE I USE
YOU LIKE A NAPKIN.

09:36.810 --> 09:41.148
( grunts )

09:46.286 --> 09:48.656
YEAH, THIS
ISN'T GONNA WORK.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.927
( warbling )

09:53.961 --> 09:55.963
GUESS WHO-OO?

09:55.996 --> 09:58.999
EDDY, I-- I REALLY
NEED YOU TO BE QUIET.

09:59.032 --> 10:03.603
ALL RIGHT. QUIET.
 SSHHH!

10:03.637 --> 10:06.640
* WHO'S THE LUCKIEST
 GIRL AT THE FAIR *

10:06.674 --> 10:09.609
* IT'S THE GIRL WHO
 WAS RIGHT WITH ME THERE *

10:09.643 --> 10:10.744
SU-EEEEY!

10:10.778 --> 10:14.982
EDDY! YOUR SINGING VOICE
IS LIKE CATS BEING DRAGGED

10:15.015 --> 10:16.149
DOWN A BLACKBOARD.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.952
UH, SORRY.
 YOU'RE WORKING.

10:18.986 --> 10:21.755
SHUSH!

10:21.789 --> 10:24.792
( hums a tune )

10:27.227 --> 10:30.630
EDDY. ALL RIGHT, I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS,

10:30.664 --> 10:33.033
BUT YOU LEAVE ME
NO OTHER CHOICE.

10:34.802 --> 10:37.237
THERE. FINALLY.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.876
( musical ringtone )

10:42.910 --> 10:44.044
HELLO?

10:44.077 --> 10:45.713
HI!

10:50.250 --> 10:52.285
Eddy:
 I'M STILL HERE!

10:55.889 --> 10:58.125
HEY, BABY.
WANNA NIBBLE?

10:58.158 --> 11:00.193
HEY, THERE'S TRENT.

11:03.731 --> 11:04.698
I BETTER GO APOLOGIZE.

11:04.732 --> 11:07.901
WHOA! SLOW IT UP,
BUTTERCUP.

11:07.935 --> 11:11.271
MAIL HIM A GREETING CARD.
IT'S SO MUCH MORE PERSONAL.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.906
GUYS, LOOK.

11:12.940 --> 11:15.108
THE CHEERLEADERS CUT UP
MY FOOD INTO TINY PIECES.

11:15.142 --> 11:18.178
I'M EATING A TURKEY BURGER
THROUGH A STRAW.

11:18.211 --> 11:21.148
MMM. GIBBLET-Y!

11:21.181 --> 11:24.017
HEY! NEW KID! COME HERE!

11:24.051 --> 11:26.153
DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS

11:26.186 --> 11:28.155
WHEN MY FOOTBALL PLAYERS
GET HUMILIATED?

11:29.222 --> 11:30.958
NO! YOU DON'T.

11:30.991 --> 11:33.827
BECAUSE MY FOOTBALL PLAYERS
DON'T GET HUMILIATED.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.863
THEY LOOK HUMILIATED TO ME.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.333
( slurps )

11:44.704 --> 11:46.206
I KNOW WHAT TEAM
SPIRIT IS ABOUT.

11:46.239 --> 11:47.808
BECAUSE I WAS THE JAMMER

11:47.841 --> 11:51.044
ON THE NORTH PACIFIC
ROLLER DERBY CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM.

11:54.214 --> 11:55.415
QUITE AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.

11:55.448 --> 11:59.686
DON'T MOCK ME,
SQUASH FACE.

11:59.719 --> 12:01.721
MY CAREER ENDED WHEN
A TRASH TALKER LIKE YOU

12:01.755 --> 12:04.291
GOT INSIDE MY HEAD
AND I WIPED.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.759
ONE ZEBRA CALLED IT

12:05.793 --> 12:08.295
THE WORST SINGLE-BODIED
COLLISION SHE'D EVER SEEN.

12:08.328 --> 12:11.799
I'D CRASH TOO IF I SAW
A TALKING ZEBRA.

12:11.832 --> 12:14.367
IT'S A REFEREE,
YOU DESK DONKEY.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.036
THEY TOLD ME WHAT YOU DID
THIS MORNING AT BREAKFAST.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.306
YOU WILL NOT UNDERMINE
THE MORALE OF MY TEAM.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.042
EVACUATE THIS TABLE.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.444
NOW!

12:25.779 --> 12:29.817
( low warbling )

12:29.850 --> 12:33.053
( deep voice )
WATCH WHO YOU'RE
TALKING TO, SPORTS BRA.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.489
I BET YOU PANICKED,

12:36.523 --> 12:38.391
THREW YOURSELF
OFF THE TRACK

12:38.425 --> 12:41.528
AND BLAMED THE OTHER
TEAM FOR YOUR WEAKNESS.

12:43.797 --> 12:47.267
DO YOU THINK THIS SPIKE THING'S
GOTTEN A BIT OUT OF HAND?

12:47.300 --> 12:50.370
HE MIGHT'VE CROSSED
THE LINE AT SPORTS BRA.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.474
I HAD TO QUIT BECAUSE
OF THAT ACCIDENT.

12:54.507 --> 12:58.745
QUIT? OR MOVE OUT
OF THE STATE IN SHAME?

12:58.778 --> 13:01.081
OOOOH.

13:01.114 --> 13:03.851
HE DOESN'T KNOW!

13:03.884 --> 13:07.220
HE WASN'T THERE.

13:07.254 --> 13:09.756
WHY DON'T YOU HOP
IN YOUR ECONOMY CAR

13:09.789 --> 13:12.325
AND TOOTLE ON HOME
TO YOUR SIX CATS

13:12.359 --> 13:15.062
AND YOUR ONLINE
BINGO TOURNAMENT.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.130
JOKES ON YOU.

13:17.164 --> 13:20.133
I HAVE FIVE CATS. HA!

13:24.071 --> 13:27.274
YOU DIDN'T GET
OUR TABLE BACK.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.909
BUMMING US OUT.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.912
EVEN MORE BUMMED OUT
WHEN WE LOSE.

13:31.945 --> 13:33.246
( whines )
DO SOMETHING.

13:35.282 --> 13:38.852
ALL RIGHT, KID.

13:38.886 --> 13:40.921
I'LL MAKE YOU A DEAL.

13:40.954 --> 13:44.257
LET'S BE CIVILIZED AND SETTLE
THIS THE OLD FASHIONED WAY.

13:44.291 --> 13:49.930
WITH A BONE-CRUSHING GRUDGE
MATCH ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD!

13:49.963 --> 13:52.565
WE'RE IN. ME...

13:52.599 --> 13:56.904

13:59.272 --> 14:02.309
YOU AND YOUR BAND OF NOBODIES
VERSUS MY FIGHTING DINGOES.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.911
WHO IS SHE CALLING A NOBODY?

14:03.944 --> 14:06.980
I GOT HALF
A BFF NECKLACE TODAY.

14:07.014 --> 14:10.050
WINNER TAKES TABLE
AND ALL THE GLORY.

14:10.083 --> 14:14.354
OH, MA'AM, AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE
TO FLEX MY FOOTBALL FANCINESS,

14:14.387 --> 14:17.991

THE FIELD TONIGHT.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.060
AH, JUST AS WELL.

14:20.093 --> 14:22.930
I CAN'T CONDONE SUCH A VIOLENT
GAME ON SCHOOL GROUNDS.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.533
SO LET'S TAKE IT TO THE
DOG PARK ACROSS THE STREET!

14:26.566 --> 14:28.368
Dingoes: YEAH!

14:32.272 --> 14:33.907
AM I THE ONLY ONE
THAT'S GONNA NEED

14:33.941 --> 14:36.143
A FRESH CHANGE OF
PANTS BEFORE WE START?

14:42.149 --> 14:45.018
( cheering )

14:51.992 --> 14:53.160
THIS DOESN'T SEEM FAIR.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.995
SEEMS FAIR TO ME.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.629
LET'S GET IT ON!
( whistle )

14:56.663 --> 14:59.066
LEPARDON ME?.

14:59.099 --> 15:01.134
I HUDDLED BEFORE
I GOT HERE.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.971
OH, MAN, YOU GUYS DON'T
KNOW HOW TO PLAY FOOTBALL.

15:04.004 --> 15:06.039
OKAY, WE NEED
TO STOP THAT TEAM

15:06.073 --> 15:08.408
FROM GETTING INTO OUR
END ZONE AND SCORING A...

15:08.441 --> 15:10.110
HIKE!

15:12.012 --> 15:14.014
( screams )

15:17.417 --> 15:19.119
...TOUCHDOWN.

15:21.054 --> 15:23.256
ALL RIGHT, ADAM.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.592
YOU SQUAT DOWN RIGHT HERE,

15:25.625 --> 15:27.127
AND WHEN I SAY, "HIKE,"

15:27.160 --> 15:29.062
YOU'RE GONNA PASS THE BALL
BETWEEN YOUR LEGS TO MY HANDS

15:29.096 --> 15:30.063
WHICH WILL BE RIGHT HERE.

15:30.097 --> 15:31.431
WHOA!

15:31.464 --> 15:35.068
HEY, IT'S FOOTBALL.

15:44.511 --> 15:47.680
( yells )
HEY!

15:47.714 --> 15:50.250
SAFETY! TWO POINTS!

15:55.255 --> 15:57.557
LOSING MAKES ME WANNA RIP OUT
MY OWN INTESTINES

15:57.590 --> 15:59.426
AND WEAR 'EM
AS A SWEAT BAND.

15:59.459 --> 16:01.428
OKAY.

16:01.461 --> 16:04.231
THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA WIN
IS IF WE USE YOUR SUPER SPEED,

16:04.264 --> 16:08.601
YOUR SUPER STRENGTH AND YOUR
SUPER-NUTTY SPLIT PERSONALITY.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.337
I'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.039
I ALREADY SMELL LIKE
A SWEATY APE.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.041
I DON'T WANT THIS
TO BE FOR NOTHING.

16:14.074 --> 16:15.675
HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

17:17.637 --> 17:19.005

17:19.038 --> 17:21.773
WHAT AM I, A BALLOON? NO.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.542
BUT I DO HAVE
SOMETHING THAT WILL.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.278
( warbling )

17:25.311 --> 17:27.114

17:59.246 --> 18:00.213
NOW REMEMBER, KIDS,

THERE'S NO SHAME IN LOSING.

18:02.282 --> 18:04.484

18:09.589 --> 18:11.591

18:16.663 --> 18:19.232
IF I DON'T COME BACK

18:19.266 --> 18:21.768
YOU'LL KNOW I FAILED.

18:24.637 --> 18:27.774

18:29.209 --> 18:31.311
( normal voice )
WAIT! WHERE AM I?

18:33.480 --> 18:35.182
OH, NO.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.383
IT'S CHASE.

18:36.416 --> 18:40.119

WHERE IS HE? WHERE IS SPIKE?

18:40.153 --> 18:43.323

18:46.626 --> 18:48.828
I TOLD YOU.

SCHOOL FOR 15 YEARS.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.668
AND NOW I DON'T
EVEN REMEMBER IT.

18:55.702 --> 18:59.806
WHEN YOU PUT IT THAT WAY,
I JUST FEEL SELFISH.

18:59.839 --> 19:03.142
YEAH.

19:04.244 --> 19:06.679

19:12.552 --> 19:14.354
AND EVEN IF WE DON'T,
WHAT DO WE HAVE TO LOSE?

19:14.387 --> 19:15.855
POPULARITY.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.357

AND I'LL USE
MY MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS

19:30.437 --> 19:32.505

20:39.972 --> 20:44.243
WELL, WE MAY NOT BE
THE ALPHA DOGS ANYMORE,

20:44.277 --> 20:46.279
BUT AT LEAST
WE STILL HAVE EACH OTHER.

20:46.313 --> 20:48.214
WE'RE NOT TOTAL NOBODIES.

21:01.728 --> 21:03.830
YOUR WHOLE LIFE'S

21:05.665 --> 21:07.934
PEOPLE LOVE FROGS.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.503

21:21.848 --> 21:23.683
TEN. I COLLECT 'EM.

21:23.716 --> 21:25.685
THEY MUST BE WORTH A LOT
'CAUSE THEY'RE SO RARE.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.820
SPEAKING OF RARE,
WHEN WAS YOUR LAST DATE?

21:27.854 --> 21:31.424
TUESDAY. WE HAD CLAMS.

21:31.458 --> 21:33.926
