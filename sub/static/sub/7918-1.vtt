00:22.000 --> 00:23.936
80,000 years ago, mankind was born.

00:24.640 --> 00:28.864
The prehistoric man knew how to conserve the gift of fire
that nature was randomly granting him:
thunderbolts and firespewing volcanoes.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.503
Yet, he did not have the ability
to create fire on his own.

00:31.856 --> 00:35.200
Fire, which we take for granted today,
was the cause of ruthless confrontations and strife.

00:35.376 --> 00:38.191
Its possession guaranteed life and
survival of our species in those hard times.

00:38.896 --> 00:43.120
Fire was used not only to cook caught game,
but also to protect from the terrible cold
of the glaciers and the intrusion of wild animals.

00:43.824 --> 00:46.992
Fire, with its lifegiving force,
was the nucleus of the protohuman hordes.

00:47.696 --> 00:49.983
He, who possessed fire, possessed life.
