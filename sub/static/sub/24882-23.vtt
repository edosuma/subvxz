Anything else, Gordon?

01:23.834 --> 01:25.100
Well, let's see. Oh!

01:25.100 --> 01:27.066
Looks like an invitation.

Ooh! An invitation to what?

01:29.033 --> 01:31.166
Well, let's read it.
It says...

01:31.166 --> 01:34.734
"You're invited to join
the Good Birds Club."

01:34.734 --> 01:38.400
- Well, "Meet us today
by Hooper's Store."

01:38.400 --> 01:40.000
- I've got to get ready.
- Oh.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.867
I'm gonna join
the Good Birds Club!

01:42.867 --> 01:44.700
OK, Big Bird. Have fun!

01:44.700 --> 01:46.066
I will, Gordon!

01:46.066 --> 01:47.967
Oh, boy. It's days like this

01:47.967 --> 01:51.433

Nice singing, Big Bird!

02:32.800 --> 02:34.567
I always sing
when I'm excited.

02:34.567 --> 02:38.000
I've been invited
to join the Good Birds Club.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.834
That must be
those birds over there.

02:40.834 --> 02:42.934
Oh, boy. Thanks, Chris.

02:42.934 --> 02:48.467
Now it's time to go join
the Good Birds Club! Ha ha!

02:48.467 --> 02:51.500
Hey, hey!
So I says to him,
"Get out of here,

02:51.500 --> 02:53.367
or I'll bop you in the beak."

02:53.367 --> 02:55.567
- Ha ha ha!
- Ha ha ha!

02:55.567 --> 02:58.100
You know, you
shouldn't bop anyone
in the beak.

02:58.100 --> 02:59.633
That's not what
a good bird would do.

02:59.633 --> 03:01.700
And what
would you know about being

03:01.700 --> 03:02.934
a good bird?

03:02.934 --> 03:06.533
I was invited to be a
member of the Good Birds Club.

03:06.533 --> 03:09.133
Oh, boy! A new member!

03:09.133 --> 03:10.700
Oh! Welcome to
the club, Good Bird.

03:10.700 --> 03:11.867
- Yay!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:11.867 --> 03:14.467
- Quiet, you squabs!
- OK.

03:14.467 --> 03:17.300
You do not look like
much of a Good Bird to me.

03:17.300 --> 03:19.967
Oh, ho.
I'm a very good bird.

03:19.967 --> 03:23.333
I clean my room, I eat my
vegetables, and I even help

03:23.333 --> 03:25.066
Gordon and Susan
set the table.

03:25.066 --> 03:26.467
He sounds like
a good bird.

03:26.467 --> 03:28.033
- Yeah.

03:28.033 --> 03:30.567
Well, look at those feet.

03:30.567 --> 03:32.300
Big Bird:
They're great, aren't they?

03:32.300 --> 03:34.600
Those feet
are ridiculous!

03:34.600 --> 03:36.233
- Ha ha ha!

03:36.233 --> 03:38.166
They're huge!
Ha ha ha ha!

03:38.166 --> 03:40.700
Aren't they, Good Birds?

03:40.700 --> 03:43.533
Well-- Well, they're
bigger than my feet.

03:43.533 --> 03:45.400
Oh, mine, too.
Yeah. They're a lot bigger.

03:45.400 --> 03:47.166
Mm-hmm.
Good Birds do not have

03:47.166 --> 03:48.967
huge feet like that.

03:48.967 --> 03:51.100
Oh, but I really want
to join the club.

03:51.100 --> 03:54.333
Sorry. We can't include
you in the Good Birds Club

03:54.333 --> 03:55.467
with feet like that.

03:55.467 --> 03:57.000
Heh heh heh. Right,
Good Birds Club?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.066
- Right.
- Right.

03:58.066 --> 03:59.533
Well, that's too bad.

03:59.533 --> 04:01.367
Yeah. So long, Bigfoot.

04:01.367 --> 04:02.734
That's Big Bird.

04:02.734 --> 04:05.800
Right. Come on.
Come on, Good Birds Club.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.500

Big Bird?

04:29.166 --> 04:31.033
I can't join
the Good Birds Club.

04:31.033 --> 04:33.467
They said my
feet are too big.

04:33.467 --> 04:35.800
Elmo doesn't think
Big Bird's feet are too big.

04:35.800 --> 04:37.433
Elmo thinks
they're just right.

04:37.433 --> 04:39.166
Well, that's
what I thought,

04:39.166 --> 04:41.300
but I guess
I was wrong.

04:41.300 --> 04:44.533
Hey. If there was only
some way I could make
my feet smaller.

04:44.533 --> 04:46.734
Wait a minute.
You're a fairy, Abby.

04:46.734 --> 04:49.600
Can you make my feet
magically smaller?

04:49.600 --> 04:52.333
I guess I could,
but I wouldn't want to.

04:52.333 --> 04:55.533
- I love your feet
just the way they are.
- Yeah.

04:55.533 --> 04:58.367
They need to
be smaller like all
the other birds.

04:58.367 --> 05:00.767
Pretty please with sugar on it?

05:00.767 --> 05:03.567
OK, but I think
it's a mistake.

05:03.567 --> 05:04.967
Ahh.

05:04.967 --> 05:07.767
Long-time listener,
first-time caller,

05:07.767 --> 05:11.133
magically make
Big Bird's feet smaller!

05:11.133 --> 05:14.367
- Elmo: It worked!
- Yes! Ha ha ha!

05:14.367 --> 05:17.166
- They're wonderful!
- Whoa!

05:17.166 --> 05:21.066
These little feet are
a little hard to balance on.

05:21.066 --> 05:22.533
Maybe I should make
them big again.

05:22.533 --> 05:24.200
They're just exactly
what I need

05:24.200 --> 05:26.433
to get into
the Good Birds Club.

05:26.433 --> 05:28.600
Thanks, Abby. Whoa!

05:28.600 --> 05:31.867
You're welcome...
I guess.

05:31.867 --> 05:33.667
I said pretty,
not clean.

05:35.433 --> 05:38.133
Oh. Check it out.
It's Bigfoot.

05:38.133 --> 05:40.500
No. That's Big Bird,
and look.

05:40.500 --> 05:44.467
My feet are smaller, so now
I'm like you, and I can be

05:44.467 --> 05:46.433
a member
of the Good Birds Club.

05:46.433 --> 05:50.000
No one gets into the
Good Birds Club unless I say so.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.033
Do you say so?

05:51.033 --> 05:52.767
Hmm. No!

05:52.767 --> 05:55.233
Why not?
My feet are smaller.

05:55.233 --> 05:57.033
Yeah, but look
at the rest of you.

05:57.033 --> 06:00.166
Look at your big eyes
and your large wings,

06:00.166 --> 06:02.500
your gigantic beak.

06:02.500 --> 06:05.100
You are way too big,
isn't he, fellas?

06:05.100 --> 06:07.900
- Uh, he is pretty big.
- Yeah, a lot bigger than us.

06:07.900 --> 06:11.200
Eh, you are way too big,
so you can't be included

06:11.200 --> 06:13.166
in the Good Birds Club.
Right, birds?

06:13.166 --> 06:14.800
Both:
Right.

06:14.800 --> 06:16.767
Oh, gee.
That's too bad.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.200
Yeah. So long,
Big Goofball.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.333
That's Big Bird.

But you're
just the right size.

06:54.233 --> 06:55.934
Well, that's
what I thought,

06:55.934 --> 06:57.600
but I guess I was wrong,

06:57.600 --> 07:01.433
But, Abby, can you
make me smaller?

07:01.433 --> 07:05.133
But you're Big Bird,
not Small Bird.

07:05.133 --> 07:07.066
Yeah, but, Abby,
I really want to be

07:07.066 --> 07:08.667
in the Good Birds Club.

07:08.667 --> 07:10.834
I don't think it's
a good idea.

07:10.834 --> 07:14.367
It's not a good idea,
it's a great idea!

07:14.367 --> 07:16.967
Ha ha! Now make me smaller.

07:16.967 --> 07:18.033
OK.

07:18.033 --> 07:20.200
He doesn't want to be big,

07:20.200 --> 07:22.133
he doesn't want to be taller,

07:22.133 --> 07:26.467
please make my friend
Big Bird smaller.

07:26.467 --> 07:29.100
Whoa! Did it work?

07:29.100 --> 07:31.767
Big Bird is
definitely smaller!

07:31.767 --> 07:33.233
Great! Thanks, Abby!

07:33.233 --> 07:35.900
Now I can be
in the Good Birds Club.

07:35.900 --> 07:38.500
Ha ha! Oh, boy, Oh, boy.

07:40.867 --> 07:44.700
Boy, I don't think
this club has very good birds

07:44.700 --> 07:46.200
in it at all.

07:46.200 --> 07:47.333

Look.
I don't see-- Ohh!

07:54.400 --> 07:57.266
That's Big Bird.
And look at me!

07:57.266 --> 07:58.934
I'm smaller.

07:58.934 --> 08:01.834
Ha! Now I can be

08:10.600 --> 08:15.400
Yeah, but you-- you--
uh, you're too yellow.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.367
We can't include you
in the club

08:17.367 --> 08:20.300
because Good Birds don't
have yellow feathers!

08:20.300 --> 08:23.367
But-- But I love
my yellow feathers.

08:23.367 --> 08:26.900
Well, I guess you'll
never be a Good Bird.

are perfect!

to change my color.

09:24.967 --> 09:26.934
What?! No!

09:26.934 --> 09:30.033
Otherwise the Good Birds
won't let me in their club.

09:30.033 --> 09:33.033
Well, maybe Big Bird
should forget about that club!

09:33.033 --> 09:35.700
- Yeah.
- But I really want
to be a Good Bird.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.700
- You are  a good bird!
- I'm not.

09:38.700 --> 09:42.066
Otherwise I'd be in
the Good Birds Club!

09:42.066 --> 09:44.767
So just please change
my color, huh, will you?

09:44.767 --> 09:47.433
- It's easy.
Just wave your wand.
- Oh.

09:47.433 --> 09:51.867
See, all you do is just say,
"1, 2, turn me blue."

09:51.867 --> 09:54.333
- Oh, no!
- Hey! I'm not yellow!

09:54.333 --> 09:57.600
Ha ha!
Now I'm going to be
a Good Bird.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.066
Ha ha!

09:59.066 --> 10:00.367
Here I come!

10:00.367 --> 10:02.567
Wait, Big Bird.
This isn't right!

10:02.567 --> 10:03.900
Yeah. Big Bird, come back!

10:03.900 --> 10:05.300
Hey. Look at me.

10:05.300 --> 10:08.667
Now I can be
in the Good Birds Club. Ha ha!

10:08.667 --> 10:11.667
He's blue. Ha ha ha!

10:11.667 --> 10:13.467
We were right, Elmo!

10:13.467 --> 10:16.300
Oh, those birds aren't
good birds at all!

10:16.300 --> 10:18.700
Those birds are being mean
to Big Bird,

10:18.700 --> 10:20.500
and they're hurting
his feelings!

10:20.500 --> 10:22.800
Well, Elmo and Abby
have to do something

10:22.800 --> 10:24.266
to help Big Bird!

10:24.266 --> 10:28.000
Yeah. A grownup.
We have to tell a grownup.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.700
So can I be in
the Good Birds Club now?

10:31.700 --> 10:33.300
No!

10:33.300 --> 10:35.033
Why not?

10:35.033 --> 10:37.367
Uh, um...
your voice is too funny.

10:37.367 --> 10:38.400
Yeah.

10:38.400 --> 10:39.600
Well, then
I'll change it.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.000
Abby, Abby, where are you?

10:42.000 --> 10:43.667
Elmo: We're here, Big Bird.
We're here!

10:43.667 --> 10:46.533
Big Bird? Big Bird!
What happened?!

10:46.533 --> 10:49.233
Well, I wanted to be
in the Good Birds Club,

10:49.233 --> 10:52.900
but they said
I wasn't good enough,
so Abby changed me,

10:52.900 --> 10:55.166
and now I need her to
change me again.

10:55.166 --> 10:58.133
The Good Birds Club
think I'm not good enough.

10:58.133 --> 11:00.266
It's true. He's not.
Heh heh heh.

11:00.266 --> 11:02.633
Am I right?
- I guess.

11:02.633 --> 11:05.000
Who cares what they think?
They're just bullying you.

11:05.000 --> 11:07.633
They're treating you as
if you're not good enough.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.700
The question is what
do you think?

11:09.700 --> 11:14.333
Well, I kind of think
I like the way I was.

11:14.333 --> 11:17.200
Elmo loves Big Bird
just the way he was.

11:17.200 --> 11:20.467
You know what?
Forget their club.
We can start our own club.

11:20.467 --> 11:22.467
You will never have
a club as good

11:22.467 --> 11:24.400
as the Good Birds Club,

11:24.400 --> 11:25.633
Right, birds, right?

11:25.633 --> 11:27.433
Our club is awesome!

11:27.433 --> 11:29.533
Our club is
gonna be even better.

11:29.533 --> 11:31.433
It will be a club that
includes everybody,

11:31.433 --> 11:33.567
and you don't have to change
in order to join.

11:33.567 --> 11:35.967
It's a club that will accept
you exactly as you are.

11:35.967 --> 11:38.033
That sounds like
a nice club.

11:38.033 --> 11:41.066
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Elmo wants
to be a part of that club.

11:41.066 --> 11:42.467
- Yeah, me, too!
- Yeah.

trying to say is that this

whereas a baseball has

23:01.800 --> 23:05.300
