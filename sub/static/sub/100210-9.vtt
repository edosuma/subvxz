00:00.070 --> 00:02.484
<i>Back in the '90s, a new craze
was sweeping the nation.</i>

00:02.562 --> 00:03.906
<i>That's right... Pokémon.</i>

00:03.977 --> 00:05.953
<i>It was a Japanese trading card game</i>

00:06.013 --> 00:07.345
<i>the kids couldn't get enough of.</i>

00:07.414 --> 00:08.614
<i>And it was so popular,</i>

00:08.710 --> 00:10.916
<i>William Penn had its own club
dedicated to it.</i>

00:10.985 --> 00:13.537
Dude! You can't use
the Charizard. It's paralyzed.

00:13.621 --> 00:16.029
Whoa! Gabe, Pika-chill, bro.

00:16.131 --> 00:18.857
While Charizard is paralyzed,
Brooke used the full heal,

00:18.928 --> 00:20.711
which, as everybody knows,
has the ability to...

00:20.798 --> 00:22.431
Un-paralyze your Pokémon.

00:22.484 --> 00:23.449
I suck.

00:23.485 --> 00:24.717
And that's why they pay me to teach.

00:24.786 --> 00:26.652
I'll get you there, pal.

00:26.688 --> 00:29.288
<i>And no one loved Pokémon more
than Toby Murphy,</i>

00:29.357 --> 00:31.491
<i>who also happened to be
the son of Mellor's lady pal.</i>

00:31.559 --> 00:32.692
Hey, Big T!

00:32.761 --> 00:35.161
Couldn't help but notice
you collect trading cards.

00:35.230 --> 00:36.796
Yeah. You collect, too?

00:36.865 --> 00:38.030
Hell yeah!

00:38.099 --> 00:40.333
- What are these?
- My old baseball cards.

00:40.435 --> 00:42.068
Thanks, but this isn't really my thing,

00:42.170 --> 00:43.836
because baseball is...

00:43.905 --> 00:44.871
not good.

00:44.939 --> 00:46.372
I read ya loud and clear.

00:46.407 --> 00:48.441
- We'll collect basketball cards.
- Eh.

00:48.543 --> 00:49.709
- Football?
- Maybe.

00:49.744 --> 00:50.810
- Hockey?
- Ew.

00:50.879 --> 00:52.178
Soccer? Do they even make...

00:52.280 --> 00:53.346
It's cool.

00:53.448 --> 00:55.148
- We'll do baseball.
- Hot dog!

00:55.216 --> 00:57.479
And we'll start with two of the greatest
players the game has ever seen.

00:57.541 --> 00:59.619
Ken Griffey Jr. and Ken Griffey Sr.

00:59.687 --> 01:02.588
- That's right... they're father and son.
- And?

01:02.657 --> 01:05.892
And not only did they play
on the same team,

01:05.960 --> 01:08.060
but one game, they both...

01:09.764 --> 01:11.397
...hit back-to-back home runs.

01:11.499 --> 01:12.498
You okay, dude?

01:12.567 --> 01:13.966
I gotta go do a man-thing.

01:15.737 --> 01:17.870
Um, Rick? I think it's really sweet

01:17.972 --> 01:19.739
that you've been trying
to bond with Toby.

01:19.774 --> 01:21.641
Well, with no luck.
I've tried everything.

01:21.709 --> 01:23.676
Sunrise boot camp, watching game tape,

01:23.745 --> 01:26.078
eating cod, chatting
about vitamin supplements,

01:26.181 --> 01:27.413
casual shadow boxing.

01:27.515 --> 01:28.684
Yeah, I was there.

01:28.747 --> 01:29.849
And then I saw him with trading cards,

01:29.918 --> 01:30.983
and I thought this one was it.

01:31.052 --> 01:33.219
But the cards he collects are Pokémon.

01:33.288 --> 01:34.921
It's this game from Japan.

01:34.989 --> 01:37.056
Well, if it's anything
like Benihana, it's got my vote.

01:37.091 --> 01:40.159
It's literally nothing
like Benihana, but just as fun.

01:40.261 --> 01:42.028
Maybe Toby could teach you.

01:42.096 --> 01:44.397
Oh, I'll learn this Pokémon but good.

01:44.465 --> 01:45.731
'Cause when it comes to learning,

01:45.800 --> 01:48.100
Rick T. Mellor needs no help.

01:48.203 --> 01:51.103
Rick T. Mellor needs help!
It's important!

01:51.172 --> 01:53.105
So is the Pennsylvania
State Aptitude Test.

01:53.141 --> 01:55.374
I need you to teach me everything
you know about Pokémon!

01:55.476 --> 01:56.542
Class is over!

01:56.644 --> 01:58.673
Clear the room! Let's go! Come on!

01:58.759 --> 02:01.414
♪ One of these days,
you're gonna get outta here ♪

02:01.482 --> 02:04.383

<i>It was December 4th, 1990-something,</i>

02:13.318 --> 02:14.527
<i>and I was ready to head home.</i>

02:14.629 --> 02:15.896
<i>My car, not so much.</i>

02:15.990 --> 02:17.163
Need a jump?

02:17.232 --> 02:19.832
<i>It was Carla, my delinquent
high-school friend</i>

02:19.934 --> 02:20.967
<i>who once stole a car,</i>

02:21.035 --> 02:22.301
<i>and now she drove a Porsche?!</i>

02:22.403 --> 02:23.469
<i>All I could say was...</i>

02:23.563 --> 02:24.470
No.

02:24.536 --> 02:25.471
Oh, yes.

02:25.540 --> 02:26.839
And it's not even stolen this time.

02:26.941 --> 02:28.975
I actually got, like,
an official real-person job.

02:29.077 --> 02:30.009
I sell drugs.

02:30.111 --> 02:31.310
I'm not sure I'd call that "official."

02:31.412 --> 02:32.511
No, silly.

02:32.614 --> 02:34.080
I'm a pharmaceutical rep.

02:34.182 --> 02:36.115
They pay me to flirt with
rich doctors and sell pills.

02:36.217 --> 02:39.457
Aw. Look at you operating within
the bounds of the legal system.

02:39.519 --> 02:40.519
I'm legit proud.

02:40.588 --> 02:42.255
And I'm legit proud of you for teaching

02:42.357 --> 02:44.490
my dumb-ass little brother
not to be such a dumb-ass.

02:44.592 --> 02:45.591
Yo, Weez!

02:45.693 --> 02:46.759
Come on, it's Mom's birthday,

02:46.861 --> 02:48.361
and you know she only
talks to me if you're there.

02:49.430 --> 02:51.063
Still can't believe
your kid brother grew up

02:51.165 --> 02:52.498
to be captain of the football team.

02:52.567 --> 02:54.066
Remember when we nicknamed him "Weasel"?

02:54.168 --> 02:55.655
He was so tiny and bitey

02:55.757 --> 02:58.178
and always poking his annoying
little head into our business.

02:58.273 --> 02:59.272
And the craziest of all?

02:59.374 --> 03:01.040
He's actually
one of my favorite students.

03:01.109 --> 03:03.442
- That's depressing.
- Hey, Ms. Lewis.

03:03.544 --> 03:04.710
Your door's on the ground.

03:04.812 --> 03:06.145
I'm gonna go now.

03:07.815 --> 03:09.782
Hello, John.

03:09.884 --> 03:11.717
We need to talk. You should sit.

03:11.819 --> 03:13.119
You should stand.

03:13.187 --> 03:15.187
You're sitting in my chair,
with your feet on my desk?

03:15.290 --> 03:17.189
Oh, man! That's where I eat my yogurt!

03:17.292 --> 03:18.958
I work more than 10 hours a day here,

03:19.060 --> 03:20.660
and for some reason, I'm still broke.

03:20.762 --> 03:22.795
I thought it was
a clerical error, 'cause I work

03:22.897 --> 03:25.665
more than enough hours
to afford a lavish lifestyle,

03:25.767 --> 03:27.867
but turns out, it's, like, super hard

03:27.969 --> 03:29.635
to earn a living
with a teacher's salary.

03:29.737 --> 03:31.871
And this is new information for you?

03:31.973 --> 03:33.673
Well, of course I knew
teachers don't make enough,

03:33.775 --> 03:36.309
but now that I'm in it,
I'm like, "Oh, God, no!"

03:36.411 --> 03:38.010
That's why I'm here to demand a raise.

03:38.112 --> 03:40.112
Double my salary. Non-negotiable, John.

03:40.181 --> 03:42.048
Well, if I can't negotiate,
I guess I have no choice

03:42.150 --> 03:43.149
but to write you a check.

03:43.251 --> 03:44.317
Wow. Okay.

03:44.419 --> 03:45.885
I should've asked for this way sooner.

03:45.987 --> 03:47.954
Whoo! Let's do this thing.

03:48.056 --> 03:49.522
But, you know, doubling your salary

03:49.624 --> 03:52.191
will definitely cover a new car
and clothing,

03:52.260 --> 03:55.895
but what about, uh,
fine dining and travel?

03:55.997 --> 03:57.096
You're right!

03:57.198 --> 03:58.597
I love those things
and didn't factor them in.

03:58.633 --> 04:00.800
You know what? I'm gonna
write you a check for 80k flat

04:00.868 --> 04:02.435
and you can decide
what to do with the money.

04:02.503 --> 04:03.402
Done!

04:03.471 --> 04:04.603
There you go.

04:04.639 --> 04:06.806
This is just a Post-it
with "Go away" on it.

04:06.908 --> 04:08.474
Is it? That's weird.

04:08.576 --> 04:10.009
Seriously, I'd like my money now.

04:10.078 --> 04:13.245
Look, even though we don't
get paid in actual riches,

04:13.314 --> 04:16.482
every day, we get
the greatest treasure of all...

04:16.517 --> 04:18.317
that incredible feeling you get inside

04:18.418 --> 04:19.719
when you help a student.

04:19.786 --> 04:20.920
And that's awesome.

04:20.988 --> 04:22.621
But I'd also like some actual treasure

04:22.724 --> 04:23.923
so I can go buy a Porsche.

04:24.025 --> 04:25.458
Where's this coming from?

04:25.526 --> 04:26.726
I ran into Carla,

04:26.794 --> 04:28.961
and she has an actual job
and makes actual money.

04:29.030 --> 04:30.029
Carla?

04:30.098 --> 04:32.098
The girl I suspected
carried a butterfly knife

04:32.200 --> 04:33.299
but could never prove it?

04:33.368 --> 04:35.768
Teaching has been amazing,
but I'm broke.

04:35.837 --> 04:37.770
You can't compare our job
to the rest of the world.

04:37.872 --> 04:39.038
You work in a school,

04:39.107 --> 04:40.473
so if all that stuff really matters,

04:40.541 --> 04:41.636
you gotta get a part-time job.

04:41.699 --> 04:42.631
Ew! No!

04:42.710 --> 04:43.709
I already have a job,

04:43.745 --> 04:45.878
and it's super hard and exhausting.

04:45.980 --> 04:47.980
I honestly deserve to be paid more.

04:48.049 --> 04:50.616
Correct. You and every other
single teacher in America.

04:50.685 --> 04:52.485
Then let's do something about it.

04:52.520 --> 04:56.022
I suppose we could call the CEO
of the National Teachers Council

04:56.057 --> 04:58.491
and get them to change
the entire educational system.

04:58.559 --> 05:00.171
- Let's do it to it!
- All right, then.

05:00.234 --> 05:01.494
I'm dialing them right now.

05:01.596 --> 05:03.629
- Give me the room.
- There you go.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.832
<i>Hello, and welcome to Moviefone!</i>

05:06.901 --> 05:08.734
<i>For "Don't Tell Mom
the Babysitter's Dead,"</i>

05:08.836 --> 05:09.969
<i>press 1!</i>

05:10.038 --> 05:11.737
Really?

05:11.806 --> 05:13.205
Oh, I needed that. That was a good one.

05:13.274 --> 05:15.908
Thank you so much, Lain.
You're the best.

05:15.943 --> 05:18.244
<i>While I was getting
a crash course in being broke,</i>

05:18.312 --> 05:20.312
<i>Mellor was learning a way
to bond with Toby.</i>

05:21.082 --> 05:22.281
Pink space alien pig girl!

05:22.383 --> 05:23.382
Jigglypuff.

05:23.451 --> 05:25.017
Maybe don't just say
exactly what you see.

05:25.119 --> 05:26.152
On it. Hit me again.

05:26.254 --> 05:27.486
<i>Next up was Mr. Mime.</i>

05:27.522 --> 05:28.654
Goofy unemployed mime guy.

05:28.723 --> 05:29.789
<i>Then the delightful Diglett.</i>

05:29.891 --> 05:30.890
Doody with a face on it.

05:30.925 --> 05:32.091
<i>And finally, Mewtwo.</i>

05:32.193 --> 05:33.759
Sexy cat with ripped quads!

05:33.828 --> 05:36.028
We've been over this 10 times.

05:36.130 --> 05:37.663
Maybe you should
go play catch with Toby.

05:37.732 --> 05:39.031
I don't want to just push him
into what I like.

05:39.133 --> 05:40.933
I had that growing up with my Step Brad.

05:41.002 --> 05:42.435
He was my stepdad, but his name was...

05:42.503 --> 05:44.170
Brad. I-I-I got it.

05:44.238 --> 05:46.205
Brad was a pitcher who never
made it in the Major League,

05:46.274 --> 05:48.274
so he just pressured me
into playing baseball.

05:48.342 --> 05:50.409
Aw, so there was something you
wanted to do instead of baseball?

05:50.478 --> 05:51.544
Yes.

05:51.612 --> 05:53.679
- Softball.
- Isn't that the same thing?

05:53.748 --> 05:55.534
Point is, I vowed long ago to never be

05:55.605 --> 05:57.650
an obsessed sports dad,
like my Step Brad.

05:57.752 --> 05:59.452
Then damn it,
I'm gonna teach you Pokémon.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.113
<i>CB was going to use the language</i>

06:01.191 --> 06:03.367
<i>that Mellor understood best... sports.</i>

06:03.421 --> 06:04.515
And then the game begins

06:04.559 --> 06:06.659
when the manager sends out
their best batter...

06:06.694 --> 06:09.328
in this case,
the lovably beefy John Kruk,

06:09.430 --> 06:11.063
- or...
- Jigglypuff.

06:11.132 --> 06:12.364
Lullaby attack!

06:12.433 --> 06:14.166
But who's out in the outfield
waiting to stop him?

06:14.235 --> 06:15.401
Sandy Alomar, or...

06:15.470 --> 06:16.435
Charmeleon.

06:16.504 --> 06:18.070
Flamethrower attack!

06:18.172 --> 06:20.239
I have nothing left to teach you.

06:20.308 --> 06:22.108
<i>But Coach Mellor wasn't the only one</i>

06:22.176 --> 06:23.442
<i>trying to broaden his horizons.</i>

06:23.544 --> 06:24.510
Hey, Weez.

06:24.579 --> 06:25.678
You do know you've been staring at that

06:25.746 --> 06:27.646
Quaker's Dozen sign-up sheet
for, like, two minutes?

06:27.715 --> 06:29.315
Only 'cause singing is for total losers,

06:29.417 --> 06:31.469
and I do not want to secretly do it...

06:31.532 --> 06:33.285
- like, really bad.
- Then you should audition.

06:33.387 --> 06:34.353
Ronnie's our quarterback,

06:34.422 --> 06:35.844
and the guy was the lead
in "Rent" last year.

06:35.899 --> 06:36.866
And got ripped on.

06:36.891 --> 06:38.257
The whole team still calls him

06:38.326 --> 06:40.759
"Dumb Ronnie Who Likes
to Dance and Sing Sometimes."

06:40.828 --> 06:42.061
That's a very literal nickname.

06:42.130 --> 06:43.796
Thanks. I worked super hard on it.

06:43.865 --> 06:45.825
At least let me give you
a few singing lessons, okay?

06:45.896 --> 06:48.000
- No judgment.
- I'll think about it.

06:48.102 --> 06:49.335
Yo, Weez!

06:49.437 --> 06:50.536
We got practice.

06:50.638 --> 06:52.037
I've thunk about it, and not a chance.

06:52.140 --> 06:53.339
Weasel...

06:53.441 --> 06:55.774
Um... what's going on here?

06:55.843 --> 06:57.076
Just trying to make some extra cash.

06:57.145 --> 06:58.878
Singing lessons are my side hustle.

06:58.980 --> 07:00.379
They're the only way I can buy groceries

07:00.481 --> 07:02.681
and a NASA-grade telescope.

07:02.783 --> 07:03.949
I need them both to live.

07:04.018 --> 07:05.684
Okay, I guess I can
just give guitar lessons.

07:05.786 --> 07:07.019
The hell you will. That's my jam.

07:07.088 --> 07:08.254
I didn't know you played guitar.

07:08.322 --> 07:10.723
I don't. I'm only two lessons
ahead of the kids I teach,

07:10.825 --> 07:12.491
and it's incredibly stressful.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.360
Okay, guess I can just tutor.

07:14.428 --> 07:17.253
Better not be for math, science,
English, or the SATs,

07:17.308 --> 07:18.697
'cause I got that locked down.

07:18.733 --> 07:20.366
<i>All the after-school jobs were taken,</i>

07:20.434 --> 07:22.368
<i>so I used the '90s version
of LinkedIn...</i>

07:22.470 --> 07:23.502
<i>the "Help Wanted" ads.</i>

07:23.571 --> 07:25.437
'Sup, dude?
I, uh, saw that West Coast Video

07:25.506 --> 07:27.306
was on the hunt
for a part-time sales associate.

07:27.375 --> 07:28.807
- You got the job.
- Don't you need to do, like,

07:28.876 --> 07:30.376
a background check or an interview?

07:30.411 --> 07:32.678
Have you ever rented
and watched a movie?

07:32.780 --> 07:33.712
Yes.

07:33.781 --> 07:35.047
Here's your vest.

07:35.149 --> 07:36.315
Wow. Thank you.

07:36.384 --> 07:38.050
- When do I start?
- You already did.

07:38.119 --> 07:40.486
I'm gonna pop over to Wawa
and grab a hoagie.

07:40.588 --> 07:42.588
Wow. Okay. Already delegating.

07:42.690 --> 07:43.656
Good call, boss.

07:43.758 --> 07:45.457
Maybe, like, tell me what to do?

07:45.526 --> 07:49.161
You rent the movies to the
people who want to rent movies.

07:49.263 --> 07:50.262
You said in your interview

07:50.364 --> 07:51.830
you knew how this whole thing worked.

07:51.933 --> 07:53.899
Oh, yeah. It's fine.
I'm sure I'll figure it out.

07:53.968 --> 07:55.834
And... he's gone.

07:55.937 --> 07:58.470
<i>While I had a new job, Mellor
had a new "in" with Toby.</i>

07:58.573 --> 07:59.972
Who's gotta catch 'em all?

08:00.074 --> 08:01.273
Big T! That's who.

08:01.375 --> 08:03.509
Whoa! What's with all the Pokémon cards?

08:03.611 --> 08:04.777
Those are for you, pal.

08:04.879 --> 08:06.912
Cleaned out Toys "R" Us
so we can build a deck together.

08:07.014 --> 08:09.248
Dude! You pulled a Charizard holo!

08:09.350 --> 08:10.316
Is that good?

08:10.418 --> 08:12.318
It's super rare! It's worth, like, $100!

08:12.420 --> 08:14.683
And it can change
all your attached energy

08:14.770 --> 08:15.836
to fire energy.

08:15.894 --> 08:16.922
Hey, how'd you know that?

08:17.024 --> 08:18.424
I thought you were
into, like, baseball cards.

08:18.526 --> 08:19.792
Pokémon is baseball...

08:19.894 --> 08:23.095
just with monsters and magic
and completely different rules.

08:23.197 --> 08:25.331
Can't wait to show
this bad boy off tomorrow.

08:25.399 --> 08:28.000
If you want, I can come by
CB's club and cheer you on.

08:28.102 --> 08:29.435
Maybe you can help me practice?

08:29.537 --> 08:30.569
Sure can, pal.

08:31.639 --> 08:33.438
You're a good man, Rick Mellor.

08:33.506 --> 08:35.039
Thanks, but all that matters to me

08:35.142 --> 08:37.676
is I'm not some crazy,
selfish sports dad.

08:37.778 --> 08:39.178
Yeah-ha!

08:39.280 --> 08:40.679
That's how it's done, baby!

08:40.780 --> 08:41.813
All right!

08:41.916 --> 08:44.316
In your face, loser!

08:44.418 --> 08:45.384
You lost!

08:45.453 --> 08:47.553
Loser Gabe who loses to Toby!

08:47.655 --> 08:49.788
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Take it down, pal.

08:49.857 --> 08:51.761
That was the best game you've
ever seen, and you know it!

08:51.823 --> 08:52.784
The boy's a champ!

08:52.860 --> 08:54.960
Oh, man. My heart's beating
so fast right now!

08:55.062 --> 08:56.629
I mean, I bought him those cards,

08:56.731 --> 08:59.331
we practiced at home, he won,

08:59.433 --> 09:01.567
which is like we won,
which is like I won!

09:01.669 --> 09:03.068
Rick, um...

09:03.170 --> 09:04.270
you got into cards

09:04.372 --> 09:06.171
so that you wouldn't become
a crazy sports dad.

09:06.274 --> 09:08.340
And I can't be,
because this is not a sport.

09:08.442 --> 09:11.277
There's no such thing
as a Japanese trading card dad.

09:11.379 --> 09:12.745
You suck, Gabe!

09:12.813 --> 09:14.980
Aah! Yeah!

09:15.082 --> 09:16.928
Undefeated hero coming through!

09:16.997 --> 09:18.795
To-by! To-by!

09:21.467 --> 09:23.818
<i>It had been a week
since I started my second job,</i>

09:23.889 --> 09:26.728
<i>and turns out, it was a place
my students went all the time.</i>

09:26.790 --> 09:29.379
Good afternoon. Can I interest
you in one of Andre's Picks?

09:29.455 --> 09:31.634
Fair warning...
they're all documentaries,

09:31.697 --> 09:32.604
so they're boring.

09:32.650 --> 09:34.550
Um, I just want to rent "Evita."

09:34.652 --> 09:37.188
I-I mean, it's for my mom,
who's super lame

09:37.243 --> 09:39.626
and loves to sing
"Don't Cry for Me Argentina"

09:39.665 --> 09:41.540
alone in my bedroom
when my mom's not home.

09:41.592 --> 09:43.652
Tell your "mom"
to stop being such a wuss

09:43.738 --> 09:45.035
and sign up for choir already.

09:45.095 --> 09:47.029
Dude, you work here? I'm out!

09:47.131 --> 09:48.199
What the hell was that?

09:48.282 --> 09:49.581
Oh, I'm his music teacher.

09:49.650 --> 09:51.216
Inspiring him to pursue his dreams.

09:51.318 --> 09:52.718
It's what I do. No big.

09:52.786 --> 09:53.707
Why didn't you tell me?

09:53.787 --> 09:56.321
- Why is me being a teacher a problem?
- 'Cause it's weird!

09:56.390 --> 09:58.323
<i>He was right. It did get kind of weird.</i>

09:58.425 --> 10:00.182
- What is happening?
- I work here.

10:00.261 --> 10:01.727
We're renting a movie from our teacher!

10:01.829 --> 10:02.861
Run!

10:02.963 --> 10:03.929
I need your vest back.

10:03.998 --> 10:05.797
No! I really need the extra money, dude.

10:05.899 --> 10:07.499
Please. I can fix this.

10:07.568 --> 10:08.867
How the hell am I gonna fix this?

10:08.902 --> 10:10.936
You can't. Students are
used to seeing us here,

10:11.038 --> 10:12.537
in our natural habitat.

10:12.573 --> 10:14.139
Teachers aren't meant
to interact with them

10:14.241 --> 10:15.240
out in the wild.

10:15.309 --> 10:17.242
As far as they know,
when the school day ends,

10:17.311 --> 10:18.543
we all sleep here, like bats,

10:18.612 --> 10:20.245
hanging upside down in the classrooms.

10:20.347 --> 10:21.847
That's why to earn extra income,

10:21.949 --> 10:23.749
we tutor here, on home ground.

10:23.817 --> 10:25.217
It's always been this way.

10:25.286 --> 10:26.818
In fact, back in olden times,

10:26.887 --> 10:29.821
when a schoolmaster had to work
part time as a blacksmith,

10:29.890 --> 10:32.090
all of his pupils
went to a different barn

10:32.192 --> 10:34.159
to obtain their much-needed horseshoes.

10:34.228 --> 10:36.862
While all those facts are wrong,
she's generally right.

10:36.930 --> 10:38.764
It sucks, but it can't be fixed.

10:38.866 --> 10:41.566
Well, neither can my car,
so watch and learn.

10:41.669 --> 10:43.068
Please don't do this.

10:43.170 --> 10:44.403
Attention, students!

10:44.471 --> 10:45.570
- I'm out.
- I can't be here.

10:45.673 --> 10:47.506
Apparently, it's crazy awkward

10:47.608 --> 10:49.274
to have your teacher
also rent you videos.

10:49.310 --> 10:51.710
Well, too bad. We have
actual lives, just like you.

10:51.812 --> 10:53.445
Yeah, we get it.
We'd just rather not see it.

10:53.514 --> 10:54.613
It's nothing personal.

10:54.682 --> 10:56.315
It's just, spotting your teacher
out in the world

10:56.383 --> 10:58.116
doing normal stuff is... off.

10:58.218 --> 10:59.251
Off? How?

10:59.353 --> 11:01.086
One time, I saw Glascott at the beach,

11:01.121 --> 11:03.322
uh, wearing jelly sandals,
with white stuff on his nose,

11:03.390 --> 11:04.489
and it was deeply unsettling.

11:04.591 --> 11:06.358
It was peak sun exposure hour.

11:06.427 --> 11:08.093
You zipped off the bottom half
of your cargo shorts,

11:08.195 --> 11:09.561
and I saw your calves, man.

11:09.630 --> 11:11.730
My legs need to breathe,
just like everyone else's.

11:11.799 --> 11:14.866
Well, I saw you at Applebee's
eating pizza with a fork.

11:14.968 --> 11:16.702
It was, like, sad and haunting.

11:18.072 --> 11:19.004
Please!

11:19.106 --> 11:20.672
I eat pizza, like a normal human.

11:20.774 --> 11:22.274
Just rent your videos from me!

11:22.376 --> 11:24.276
<i>While I was desperate
to get my kids on board,</i>

11:24.311 --> 11:27.045
<i>Coach Mellor was crushing it
as a Pokémon dad.</i>

11:27.114 --> 11:29.348
<i>Yep, he was gonna take Toby
straight to the top.</i>

11:35.122 --> 11:36.922
Okay, Toby, look at me.

11:36.990 --> 11:39.191
This is why we've been running
two-a-days all week.

11:39.293 --> 11:42.427
This game separates
the Pokéboys from the Pokémen.

11:42.529 --> 11:44.262
Wow. Um... Wow. Okay.

11:44.365 --> 11:45.664
- Mm.
- Sorry, guys.

11:45.733 --> 11:47.499
Uh, players just started
their first round.

11:47.568 --> 11:49.668
Toby's not starting?
He's the best player you got.

11:49.770 --> 11:50.936
Well, he'll play the next round.

11:51.038 --> 11:52.804
So, he's supposed to ride the pine

11:52.906 --> 11:54.406
while Gabe gets play time?

11:54.508 --> 11:55.707
Gabe?!

11:55.776 --> 11:57.409
Oh, don't worry about this.

11:57.511 --> 11:59.077
Use this as fuel, buddy.

11:59.146 --> 12:02.080
Go out there and crush Gabe
and make me proud.

12:02.182 --> 12:04.316
I mean, I'll... try my best.

12:04.351 --> 12:06.351
Okay, yeah, I-I...
Of course you will. I know that.

12:06.453 --> 12:07.719
But that's not what I'm asking you.

12:07.821 --> 12:09.721
See, I need you
to go out there and do...

12:09.823 --> 12:11.323
better than the best you can.

12:11.392 --> 12:14.393
No pressure, but I just loved
watching my boy win last time,

12:14.461 --> 12:17.529
so if you could please only win
from here on out,

12:17.598 --> 12:20.031
'cause that feeling is unmatched!

12:20.134 --> 12:22.667
And it's on you to give it to me.

12:22.710 --> 12:23.635
No pressure.

12:23.694 --> 12:25.771
- Uh, kinda feeling the pressure.
- Don't!

12:25.873 --> 12:27.973
I'll still care about you if you lose.

12:28.041 --> 12:29.708
But I'll have lost a lot of pride,

12:29.777 --> 12:31.877
and it just won't be the same.

12:32.946 --> 12:35.380
Now go get 'em, tiger. Come on.

12:35.482 --> 12:38.083
Hey, um, you know, why don't you
give Toby some space?

12:38.152 --> 12:41.052
But he needs me to shout support
and aggressive advice.

12:41.155 --> 12:42.854
You can totally do that,
but just maybe...

12:42.890 --> 12:44.456
just from, like, the hallway.

12:44.525 --> 12:46.124
<i>Coach had gotten shut out,</i>

12:46.193 --> 12:48.794
<i>but I saw an opening to get
my kids renting videos again.</i>

12:48.896 --> 12:50.896
Look what I have. "Evita."

12:50.998 --> 12:53.865
You know, the movie you've
apparently rented 16 times.

12:53.934 --> 12:55.367
Shh!

12:55.402 --> 12:57.702
Can you please be cool
and not tell anyone

12:57.771 --> 12:59.938
my dream is to sing
in a modern day opera?

13:00.040 --> 13:01.039
Two conditions.

13:01.108 --> 13:02.574
One, you audition for Quaker's Dozen.

13:02.676 --> 13:04.409
Fine. But only 'cause I super want to.

13:04.478 --> 13:06.711
Two, you tell all your friends
to rent their movies from me.

13:06.780 --> 13:08.013
Come on. It's too weird.

13:08.115 --> 13:09.781
Like, this one time, I saw Glascott

13:09.883 --> 13:12.317
at a Ross Dress for Less
buying a Velcro wallet.

13:12.386 --> 13:14.719
Okay, real-world Glascott is unsettling,

13:14.822 --> 13:16.321
but I'm different.

13:16.390 --> 13:19.024
In fact, I'm willing
to rent out R-rated movies.

13:19.092 --> 13:20.358
No questions asked.

13:20.427 --> 13:22.627
<i>And so I started
the greatest side hustle</i>

13:22.729 --> 13:24.362
<i>in William Penn history.</i>

13:24.465 --> 13:26.832
<i>The kids would grab a PG-rated movie.</i>

13:26.867 --> 13:29.100
<i>After some sleight-of-hand misdirection,</i>

13:29.203 --> 13:31.436
<i>I'd get slipped their R-rated request.</i>

13:31.505 --> 13:32.637
<i>See, back in the day,</i>

13:32.706 --> 13:34.506
<i>video stores didn't leave tapes out.</i>

13:34.575 --> 13:36.741
<i>Employees had to get them
from behind the counter,</i>

13:36.810 --> 13:39.311
<i>which made it easy to slip in
an R-rated movie instead.</i>

13:39.379 --> 13:41.146
<i>It was the perfect crime.</i>

13:43.994 --> 13:46.017
- What was that?
- What was what?

13:46.053 --> 13:48.720
You just very blatantly
rented an R-rated movie

13:48.822 --> 13:50.021
to three kids that you teach,

13:50.090 --> 13:52.757
and then they gave you a sizable
kickback into the tip jar.

13:52.826 --> 13:53.758
Here's my vest.

13:53.861 --> 13:55.327
To be clear...

13:55.429 --> 13:58.096
I hate this job, and I want in.

14:00.367 --> 14:02.133
<i>Thanks to me, West Coast Video</i>

14:02.169 --> 14:04.002
<i>was getting more business than ever.</i>

14:04.071 --> 14:06.256
<i>I was well on my way
to being the only teacher...</i>

14:06.322 --> 14:07.555
<i>...with a Porsche.</i>

14:07.607 --> 14:09.241
<i>Or, at least, a used Jetta.</i>

14:09.343 --> 14:10.542
<i>Thanks to my brilliant plan,</i>

14:10.611 --> 14:12.878
<i>I was swimming in cash and Pixie Stix.</i>

14:12.980 --> 14:15.013
<i>Nothing could stop us. Until...</i>

14:15.115 --> 14:17.516
Yeah, which one of you
rented my daughter "Se7en"

14:17.618 --> 14:19.885
- instead of "Stuart Little"?
- You're fired.

14:19.987 --> 14:21.019
Here's the vest.

14:21.121 --> 14:22.387
<i>While I was getting fired,</i>

14:22.456 --> 14:24.529
<i>Mellor was fired up
to take Toby to the pros.</i>

14:24.592 --> 14:27.959
The Pokémon Tropical Mega Battle
begins in three weeks,

14:28.061 --> 14:29.761
and we've got work to do to qualify.

14:29.863 --> 14:30.829
Tropic Mega What?

14:30.931 --> 14:32.864
It's an international Pokémon tournament

14:32.966 --> 14:34.866
held at the Hilton Hawaiian Village

14:34.968 --> 14:36.101
in sunny Honolulu.

14:36.169 --> 14:38.803
You seriously want Toby
to skip a month of school

14:38.906 --> 14:40.872
so he can play a fantasy card game?

14:40.974 --> 14:42.140
We don't have to go
for the full month...

14:42.242 --> 14:43.775
just for the main events.

14:43.877 --> 14:46.111
And, of course, Japanese musician/

14:46.179 --> 14:49.848
trading card game artist
Tomoaki Imakuni,

14:49.917 --> 14:53.151
who will perform "Gunyagunya Gasu Gasu."

14:53.353 --> 14:54.452
Is this even real?

14:54.555 --> 14:56.254
It is 100% real.

14:56.356 --> 14:58.490
All we need is $9,000

14:58.592 --> 15:01.126
for hotel, entrance fee, and plane fare.

15:01.228 --> 15:03.428
We will be using your SkyMiles, Julie.

15:03.530 --> 15:05.931
Well, I'd rather just be a kid
and do school.

15:06.033 --> 15:07.165
So it's settled. No.

15:07.267 --> 15:08.533
Don't listen to her, son.

15:08.635 --> 15:10.535
She may not believe in you, but I do.

15:10.637 --> 15:11.770
Well, don't!

15:11.872 --> 15:14.339
I quit that club, so you can
forget about Honolulu.

15:14.441 --> 15:15.740
You quit? Why?

15:15.842 --> 15:18.476
'Cause you put all this pressure
on me, and it stopped being fun.

15:18.579 --> 15:19.844
But...

15:19.947 --> 15:21.246
this was our thing.

15:21.315 --> 15:24.115
Yeah, it used to be...
till you ruined it.

15:24.217 --> 15:25.150
Thanks a lot.

15:27.354 --> 15:28.820
It's cool. I'm...

15:28.922 --> 15:30.855
I know how to handle this.
I deal with kids all day.

15:30.958 --> 15:33.358
You can't handle this one
like you're a teacher, Rick.

15:33.427 --> 15:36.194
We both know that
you're more than that to him.

15:36.296 --> 15:38.371
At least... you were.

15:42.050 --> 15:44.526
<i>After losing my second job
at the video store,</i>

15:44.613 --> 15:46.441
<i>my actual job was looking rather shaky.</i>

15:46.496 --> 15:49.189
Okay, okay, e-everyone,
calm down, please.

15:49.243 --> 15:52.189
I'm sure Lainey has a
perfectly reasonable explanation

15:52.259 --> 15:55.275
as to why she rented
your children R-rated movies.

15:55.348 --> 15:57.549
Look, your kids are in high school.

15:57.610 --> 15:59.775
They're gonna watch R-rated
movies with or without me.

15:59.830 --> 16:01.510
In fact, I actually introduced them

16:01.557 --> 16:02.977
to some of the world's greatest films

16:03.032 --> 16:04.907
that happen to be rated R...
like "The Godfather."

16:04.986 --> 16:06.719
Ooh! Best Picture of the year.

16:06.821 --> 16:09.755
- And "Braveheart."
- Historical and entertaining.

16:09.857 --> 16:10.856
And "The Matrix."

16:10.958 --> 16:12.591
Ooh! They walk on walls.

16:12.693 --> 16:15.427
I educated them
outside of the classroom.

16:15.496 --> 16:17.129
So, really, I went above and beyond.

16:17.198 --> 16:20.065
And that is a perfectly
reasonable explanation.

16:20.134 --> 16:23.502
So, how exactly is the movie
"Showgirls" educational?

16:23.571 --> 16:25.270
That... shows you what will happen

16:25.373 --> 16:26.772
if you don't stay in school.

16:26.841 --> 16:28.674
And what would you say
is the educational value

16:28.776 --> 16:30.242
of "American Pie"?

16:30.344 --> 16:32.578
I haven't seen it,
but one can only assume

16:32.680 --> 16:34.713
that it refers to the Don McLean song

16:34.782 --> 16:36.382
about that tragic plane crash.

16:36.417 --> 16:38.384
It's about a kid
who puts his [bleep] in a pie.

16:38.452 --> 16:39.485
What?!

16:39.553 --> 16:41.086
No!

16:41.188 --> 16:43.255
Lainey, no!

16:43.324 --> 16:44.857
Why, Lainey?! Why?!

16:44.959 --> 16:46.492
I'm sorry! I messed up!

16:46.552 --> 16:48.284
Something has to be done
about this, John.

16:48.339 --> 16:51.030
They're right. I got so caught up
in comparing my life to others,

16:51.098 --> 16:52.498
I forgot what really matters.

16:52.566 --> 16:55.601
So I understand that
you gotta do what you gotta do.

16:55.670 --> 16:57.136
And you know what that is?

16:58.139 --> 17:00.660
To tell you all you should be
ashamed of yourselves.

17:00.761 --> 17:02.841
- Excuse me?
- Has it occurred to you

17:02.943 --> 17:06.045
why one of my best teachers is
working at that store anyways?

17:06.113 --> 17:08.614
It's so she can afford
to keep teaching your kids,

17:08.683 --> 17:10.915
which she loves,
while still making ends meet.

17:10.984 --> 17:13.218
Now, I'm sure Lainey knows
that she was wrong

17:13.287 --> 17:14.619
and has to quit that job.

17:14.689 --> 17:15.788
I was already fired.

17:15.890 --> 17:17.656
She was already fired!

17:17.758 --> 17:19.090
So, instead of getting on her case

17:19.160 --> 17:21.993
about a couple of nudie bakery movies,

17:22.063 --> 17:24.696
you should be thanking
this wonderful teacher

17:24.799 --> 17:28.099
for her tireless work and dedication.

17:29.070 --> 17:30.069
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

17:30.171 --> 17:31.303
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

17:31.372 --> 17:32.404
Thank you.

17:33.340 --> 17:35.474
Oh, my God.
I can't believe I'm not fired.

17:35.576 --> 17:36.408
I know, right?

17:36.510 --> 17:37.509
Honestly, it means so much

17:37.578 --> 17:38.911
that you stuck up for me like that.

17:38.946 --> 17:41.580
I'm just doing my job,
like you're always doing yours.

17:41.649 --> 17:43.015
Speaking of doing my job...

17:43.050 --> 17:45.384
Weasel, enough staring
at the sign-up sheet, already.

17:45.486 --> 17:47.519
Let's go. You're auditioning
for Quaker's Dozen.

17:47.621 --> 17:50.055
Take it from me. Stop caring
what other people think.

17:50.124 --> 17:51.168
Just do your best.

17:51.246 --> 17:53.659

19:00.194 --> 19:02.049
...this right here is priceless.

19:02.142 --> 19:03.195
Here.

19:03.264 --> 19:05.130
I think you've earned this.

19:05.199 --> 19:07.766
Probably not the best time
to go over some budget proposal.

19:07.868 --> 19:09.201
It's to get you a raise.

19:09.336 --> 19:10.836
All of my teachers.

19:10.905 --> 19:12.771
What? Is that even possible?

19:12.826 --> 19:13.738
God, no.

19:13.777 --> 19:15.480
But I'm sure as hell gonna try.

19:16.944 --> 19:18.644
<i>The one thing you can't put a number on</i>

19:18.712 --> 19:20.946
<i>is the love and support
of those around you...</i>

19:21.048 --> 19:22.414
<i>though sometimes they have to learn</i>

19:22.516 --> 19:23.749
<i>how to show that support.</i>

19:23.818 --> 19:26.718
Hey. I didn't see you and Big T
after school today.

19:26.787 --> 19:29.388
Yeah, well, the kid's taking
a permanent Poké-break.

19:29.514 --> 19:31.548
- Got a tad carried away, huh?
- A tad?

19:31.625 --> 19:32.991
You know, I swore I'd be different

19:33.093 --> 19:35.961
if I ever got the chance
to be a dad to someone.

19:36.030 --> 19:38.630
But in the end, I became the
exact thing I said I'd never be.

19:38.732 --> 19:40.599
But the difference
between you and Step Brad

19:40.701 --> 19:42.267
is you're willing to change.

19:42.336 --> 19:43.702
That's what really matters.

19:43.804 --> 19:45.337
<i>And when you care about somebody,</i>

19:45.406 --> 19:47.114
<i>you do whatever it takes.</i>

19:47.200 --> 19:50.275
Don't mind me, kid.
I'm just poppin' some packs.

19:50.344 --> 19:52.144
I told you, I'm done with Pokémon.

19:52.246 --> 19:54.546
These cards aren't for you.
I'm building my own deck.

19:54.638 --> 19:55.547
For what?

19:55.645 --> 19:56.548
Fun.

19:57.651 --> 20:01.553
Maybe... sometime,
we can hang and trade cards.

20:01.655 --> 20:03.552
How's about we have a catch instead?

20:04.625 --> 20:06.925
You ever throw a softball? Way more fun.

20:07.027 --> 20:09.394
<i>Turns out, the people we love
only want to help us</i>

20:09.463 --> 20:11.697
<i>become the best versions of ourselves,</i>

20:11.799 --> 20:14.766
<i>and sometimes that means
broadening our horizons.</i>

20:14.869 --> 20:18.304
<i>But in the end, that's what
makes us closer than ever.</i>

20:18.476 --> 20:19.836
It's become embarrassingly clear

20:19.905 --> 20:22.249
that your knowledge of R-rated
films is extremely lacking,

20:22.328 --> 20:23.928
so it's time for a crash course.

20:24.030 --> 20:25.496
I'm in. Hit me.

20:25.564 --> 20:27.131
We'll start with "Wild Things."

20:27.233 --> 20:29.633
Those girls were just
punching each other in the face,

20:29.735 --> 20:31.135
and now they're kissing?

20:31.237 --> 20:33.537
That does not feel earned.

20:33.639 --> 20:36.440
Why would Demi Moore do
this "Striptease" movie?

20:36.542 --> 20:39.076
I like her better when she's
making pottery with a ghost.

20:39.178 --> 20:41.645
I don't see what the big deal is
with this "Basic Instinct."

20:41.747 --> 20:43.714
And... now I see it.

20:43.816 --> 20:45.015
Are they allowed to do that?

20:45.084 --> 20:47.651
Okay, wait, they're gonna take
his face off

20:47.753 --> 20:50.454
and then take that guy's face off

20:50.556 --> 20:53.625
and then put the faces on the other guy?

20:53.695 --> 20:55.742
- What's this called?
- "Face/Off."

20:55.851 --> 20:58.156
Ohh! I liked "Se7en" so much better

20:58.218 --> 20:59.645
when I didn't know what was in the box!
