<i> In new york city's war on crime,</i>

00:04.478 --> 00:05.814

00:07.259 --> 00:09.633
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:12.848 --> 00:15.556
That was riveting.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.468
Yeah, but I'm still
a fact-checker.

00:18.469 --> 00:20.779
Hey, that was your mother's idea.

00:20.780 --> 00:24.656
To torture me.

00:24.657 --> 00:27.199
You've read my latest, but
you haven't said anything.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.739
Mm.

00:28.740 --> 00:31.346
<i>Culture of youtube.</i>

00:31.347 --> 00:34.356
And?

00:34.357 --> 00:37.967
You write far too well
for such a crappy title.

00:42.883 --> 00:45.554
I want to know
everything about you.

00:45.555 --> 00:46.556
Uh-oh. Everything?

00:46.557 --> 00:49.396
Yeah, um, your first job.

00:49.397 --> 00:52.035
Shining shoes.

00:52.036 --> 00:54.573
Um, first thing you
ever got published.

00:54.574 --> 00:57.610
<i>Uh, a penthouse letter?</i>

00:57.611 --> 01:00.316
Well, now I have
some rotten business

01:00.317 --> 01:01.786
Waiting for me at the office,

01:01.787 --> 01:04.723
But we'll see each other
later at the party.

01:04.724 --> 01:07.257
You are coming.

01:07.258 --> 01:08.757
I can't.

01:08.758 --> 01:10.930
Oh. Come on.

01:10.931 --> 01:13.301
And spend the whole
night staring at you?

01:13.302 --> 01:15.473
She'll see and she'll know.

01:21.219 --> 01:22.586
Puerile?

01:22.587 --> 01:24.624
Frankie, it's a cover.

01:24.625 --> 01:27.730
The c-- a photo
montage is puerile?

01:27.731 --> 01:30.369
Are we looking at
the same thing here?

01:30.370 --> 01:32.573
Frank, your covers win awards.

01:32.574 --> 01:34.377
You don't want that out there.

01:34.378 --> 01:35.413
Uh-huh. Okay.

01:35.414 --> 01:36.682
So--so tell me what
do you want to do?

01:36.683 --> 01:38.119
You want to-
you want to just chuck it?

01:38.120 --> 01:40.824
Just--just throw it away?

01:40.825 --> 01:43.295
You can do better.

01:47.270 --> 01:49.707
Is that fabulous?

01:53.482 --> 01:54.482
You're late.

01:54.483 --> 01:56.052
I have to go.

01:56.053 --> 01:57.822
You're gonna have to
call for another car.

01:57.823 --> 01:59.425
I'm not going.

01:59.426 --> 02:02.898
I told you we had
to leave by 8:00.

02:02.899 --> 02:05.702
I'm not going.

02:05.703 --> 02:07.072
Stuck at the office?

02:07.073 --> 02:10.644
Not quite the glamorous line
of work you thought, huh?

02:10.645 --> 02:11.947
I don't feel well.

02:11.948 --> 02:13.951
Do you want me
to call dr. Harris?

02:16.623 --> 02:19.729
Showing yourself to the boys.

02:19.730 --> 02:21.966
What were you being?

02:21.967 --> 02:24.003
I was being bad.

02:24.004 --> 02:26.808
Show me what you did.

02:32.487 --> 02:33.754
Oh.

02:33.755 --> 02:35.491
That's so naughty.

02:35.492 --> 02:36.928
You want a spanking, don't you?

02:36.929 --> 02:39.732
Uh-huh. I deserve it.

02:47.214 --> 02:49.050
He likes you, the doctor.

02:49.051 --> 02:51.053
Yes, he'll be a regular.

02:51.054 --> 02:54.793
That's good.

02:54.794 --> 02:58.931
Sofia, paulina, this is dmitry.

02:58.932 --> 03:02.969
Look at these sweet girls.

03:02.970 --> 03:05.971
Mm.

03:05.972 --> 03:09.339
When they see you, all the
men will want to marry you.

03:14.805 --> 03:16.238
I read your blog.

03:16.239 --> 03:17.572
You're expanding your single

03:17.573 --> 03:19.873
Into a seven-parter
on the russian mob.

03:19.874 --> 03:21.674
That's daunting.

03:21.675 --> 03:25.243
Yeah, like trying to decide
what to wear with a flak vest.

03:32.416 --> 03:34.485
Time to make up, amigo.

03:34.486 --> 03:38.288
Frankie, hey, I'm your
biggest supporter.

03:38.289 --> 03:40.623
Right.

03:44.327 --> 03:47.662
Oh, um, I'm gonna pass

03:47.663 --> 03:50.431
On my party plans
for tomorrow night.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.003
Trisha...

03:57.004 --> 04:00.005
I've considered your
serialized piece.

04:00.006 --> 04:02.207
Won't happen.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.641
Not funny, connor.

04:03.642 --> 04:05.008
It's not a joke. I'm sorry.

04:05.009 --> 04:06.476
One and done.

04:06.477 --> 04:09.344
One and done?

04:09.345 --> 04:11.212
It's--it's the russian mob.

04:11.213 --> 04:12.280
It's gonna be hot.

04:12.281 --> 04:14.348
Serialized isn't working.

04:14.349 --> 04:15.749
Ad pages are down.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.116
Not for my stuff.

04:17.117 --> 04:18.483
Don't shut me down

04:18.485 --> 04:19.885
Because no one in the checkout line

04:19.886 --> 04:22.921
Bought your 9,000 words
on the art of myanmar.

04:22.922 --> 04:26.191
Look, patricia...

04:26.192 --> 04:27.959
When you're running things,

04:27.960 --> 04:29.794
Publish whatever the hell you want.

04:29.795 --> 04:32.429
Until then, suck it up.

04:38.936 --> 04:40.703
Whoo!

04:40.704 --> 04:42.471
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

04:42.472 --> 04:45.107
Thank you.

04:45.108 --> 04:47.409
Oh, and thank you.

04:47.410 --> 04:49.144
Please, everybody come in.

04:49.145 --> 04:50.145
Come on, come on, come on.

04:50.146 --> 04:51.913
You beautiful people, you.

04:51.914 --> 04:53.314
Thank you alfor coming.

04:53.315 --> 04:54.682
You look absolutely fabulous,

04:54.683 --> 04:56.051
Every single one of you.

04:56.052 --> 04:57.619
I couldn't be happier
that you're all here

04:57.620 --> 04:59.654
To share in this
amazing celebration.

04:59.655 --> 05:01.154
Now, over the last year,

05:01.155 --> 05:02.921
We've lost some brethren--

05:02.922 --> 05:07.662
<i>Gourmet, vibe, pc, jane,</i>

05:07.663 --> 05:09.297
<i>Playgirl went bottoms up.</i>

05:09.298 --> 05:11.766
Come on. Everyone, raise a glass.

05:11.767 --> 05:12.934
Take a look around you.

05:12.935 --> 05:16.169
<i>After 50 years, inset lives.</i>

05:16.170 --> 05:18.605
We're still here. Huh?

05:18.606 --> 05:21.007
we're still here.

05:21.008 --> 05:23.777
Oh.

05:23.778 --> 05:25.912
Mm.

05:27.881 --> 05:31.349
Okay.

05:31.350 --> 05:32.383
Connor?

05:32.384 --> 05:35.119
I'm sorry, okay?

05:37.589 --> 05:39.256
Oh, my god.

06:34.582 --> 06:36.382
I had a lot to drink, okay?

06:36.383 --> 06:38.051
I must have blacked out.

06:38.052 --> 06:40.787
I don't--I don't remember
anything after the party.

06:40.788 --> 06:42.622
Just seeing him.

06:42.623 --> 06:43.756
Master bedroom's clean.

06:43.757 --> 06:45.224
Well, I assume the maids

06:45.225 --> 06:47.260
Came and cleaned up
before the party.

06:47.261 --> 06:49.028
So you woke up in...

06:49.029 --> 06:50.997
In the guest bedroom upstairs.

06:50.998 --> 06:52.932
And was there anybody
else in the house?

06:52.933 --> 06:56.002
I don't know.

06:56.003 --> 06:58.271
No.

06:58.272 --> 07:00.440
So...You woke up,

07:00.441 --> 07:02.141
And then you found him,

07:02.142 --> 07:05.510
And you called 911.

07:05.511 --> 07:09.247
Mr. Bollinger, what
is that on your shirt?

07:09.248 --> 07:11.617
Is that blood?

07:11.618 --> 07:14.419
I hugged him.

07:14.420 --> 07:17.121
But he was dead.

07:20.292 --> 07:23.594
"I was drunk. I blacked out.

07:23.595 --> 07:25.562
I have blood on my shirt."

07:25.563 --> 07:27.529
Gee, I could have done
much better than that.

07:27.530 --> 07:30.435
You're not an amateur.

07:30.436 --> 07:33.336
Uh, dead maybe 5 1/2 hours.

07:33.337 --> 07:36.004
Two blows to the head.

07:36.005 --> 07:41.239
Probably struck first
by a blunt, heavy object

07:41.240 --> 07:42.342
On the left temple.

07:42.343 --> 07:45.411
Mm-hmm.

07:45.412 --> 07:48.581
Then...

07:48.582 --> 07:50.582
Oh, second blow's different.

07:50.583 --> 07:52.521
Yeah. Blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

07:52.522 --> 07:55.524
Possibly a fall after
the first blow, or...

07:55.525 --> 07:58.760
Or the killer smashed
his head into the floor.

07:58.761 --> 08:02.430
Mm-hmm.

08:02.431 --> 08:04.031
Wow.

08:04.032 --> 08:08.001
Ooh, what are these?

08:08.002 --> 08:09.769
Minor lacerations.

08:09.770 --> 08:10.970
Something he grabbed and held.

08:10.971 --> 08:13.238
Yeah. Let's get photos of that.

08:13.239 --> 08:15.840
Csu should check this for prints.

08:15.841 --> 08:16.841
It's out of place.

08:16.842 --> 08:18.877
The awards are all on that shelf.

08:18.878 --> 08:22.953
The scott ison award
for publishing.

08:22.954 --> 08:24.821
This might be dried
blood at the base.

08:27.423 --> 08:29.088
Hmm.

08:32.190 --> 08:34.986
Mom, have you seen my phone?

08:34.986 --> 08:37.485
Dad, what are you doing here?

08:40.620 --> 08:41.787
What's going on?

08:41.788 --> 08:44.020
Hey, sweetheart.

08:44.022 --> 08:46.056
What?

08:46.057 --> 08:50.727
Honey, connor was
murdered last night.

08:50.728 --> 08:53.729
- What?
- We are all in shock.

08:53.730 --> 08:55.864
- No!
- Honey, I know--

08:55.865 --> 08:57.533
No!

08:59.635 --> 09:01.269
Lousy time for magazines.

09:01.270 --> 09:03.170
<i>My father read inset.</i>

09:03.171 --> 09:05.605
I remember this picture
of ursula andress.

09:05.606 --> 09:07.473
She had this brassiere
that shot bullets.

09:07.474 --> 09:09.575
Your father read it.

09:09.576 --> 09:12.278
It was, uh, shared.

09:12.279 --> 09:14.913
We fought over the
crossword puzzles.

09:14.914 --> 09:16.814
Connor james' final editorial--

09:16.815 --> 09:18.282
<i>Everything must die.</i>

09:18.283 --> 09:19.883
No kidding.

09:19.884 --> 09:22.319
His art director's a guy
named frank bollinger.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.353
Discovered the body
just after 5:00 a.M.,

09:24.354 --> 09:25.554
Called 911.

09:25.555 --> 09:26.922
Bollinger spent the night?

09:26.923 --> 09:28.890
Can we take something from that?

09:28.891 --> 09:31.325
My take is that frank's gay.

09:31.326 --> 09:33.594
Hmm. Well, he didn't
tell us that, but, uh...

09:33.595 --> 09:37.498
But women know these things.

09:37.499 --> 09:39.232
So maybe it was a lover's spat.

09:39.233 --> 09:42.401
Well, bollinger seemed
sincerely distraught,

09:42.402 --> 09:44.936
And he didn't try to hide
the blood on his shirt,

09:44.937 --> 09:47.773
And hung around, called 911, so...

09:47.774 --> 09:49.441
People never murder and
then feel bad about it.

09:49.442 --> 09:51.476
Anyway, the king is dead.

09:51.477 --> 09:54.245
So who's moving on the throne?

09:57.015 --> 09:57.480
The stockholders asked me e  toak

09:59.049 --> 10:00.849
<i>Edi r pro tem.</i>

10:00.850 --> 10:02.317
I couldn't refuse.

10:02.318 --> 10:03.886
No, no, sure you couldn't.

10:03.887 --> 10:06.522
Continuity of leadership is, uh-
-it's crucial, huh?

10:06.523 --> 10:09.792
Still, it's hard to walk
past connor's empty office.

10:09.793 --> 10:13.062
We need to get in there
before anything's packed up.

10:13.063 --> 10:15.798
You're gonna hear that
I wanted this position,

10:15.799 --> 10:17.933
And I did, but not like this.

10:17.934 --> 10:21.337
- So, um, your-
- your working relationship

10:21.338 --> 10:23.172
Was, uh, pretty good?

10:23.173 --> 10:25.975
Connor was cautious
and I lead with my chin,

10:25.976 --> 10:27.343
But every month,

10:27.344 --> 10:29.545
We got the book to the
printers without a hitch.

10:29.546 --> 10:30.980
Book?

10:30.981 --> 10:35.117
Oh, in the trade, we
never say "magazine."

10:35.118 --> 10:37.686
What about connor
and frank bollinger?

10:37.687 --> 10:40.087
Oh, connor was frank's mentor.

10:40.088 --> 10:43.690
Hmm. Sleepovers usually
imply something more.

10:43.691 --> 10:45.558
Oh, of course.

10:45.559 --> 10:47.960
No, connor was straight.

10:47.961 --> 10:52.030
He was fond of frank, and
frank worshipped connor.

10:52.031 --> 10:54.298
But...

10:54.299 --> 10:55.866
But what?

10:55.867 --> 10:58.769
Frank was sensitive
about his work.

10:58.770 --> 11:00.905
But so am I, so--

11:00.906 --> 11:05.509
So when they argued,
you understood.

11:05.510 --> 11:07.043
What'd they argue about?

11:07.044 --> 11:09.811
Connor trashed
frank's cover design

11:09.812 --> 11:11.145
For the next issue.

11:11.146 --> 11:12.479
He said frank lost it.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.482
He ranted. He threw all
of his work in his face.

11:15.483 --> 11:17.716
Rage issues.

11:17.717 --> 11:21.219
I have a lot on my plate.

11:21.220 --> 11:24.388
Grieving staff.

11:24.389 --> 11:27.392
Sure.

11:27.393 --> 11:29.929
Frank bollinger has
an assault record.

11:29.930 --> 11:31.398
He was arrested at a bar.

11:31.399 --> 11:33.233
So he drinks and gets violent.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.601
And when connor james
nixed his cover design...

11:35.602 --> 11:37.702
Doesn't seem like a
reason to kill him.

11:37.703 --> 11:40.871
Oh, this qualifies him.

11:40.872 --> 11:45.106
His prints match those
found on the murder weapon.

11:45.107 --> 11:49.073
I'm here because connor
and I had an argument?

11:49.074 --> 11:50.206
I could have been here a lot

11:50.207 --> 11:51.705
During the past seven years.

11:51.706 --> 11:54.273
Except connor
hadn't been murdered.

11:54.274 --> 11:57.543
Was kicking and throwing your
work in his face your trademark?

11:57.544 --> 11:59.911
Come on. I, uh, acted out.

11:59.912 --> 12:02.346
Along with a d.U.I.
, you have a past assault charge.

12:02.347 --> 12:03.380
Detectives.

12:03.381 --> 12:04.781
No, wait, I want
them to hear this.

12:04.782 --> 12:06.082
I was out with my boyfriend

12:06.083 --> 12:07.116
And some redneck was hassling us.

12:07.117 --> 12:08.284
I don't take that crap.

12:08.285 --> 12:11.720
But, see, frank,
this is our problem.

12:11.721 --> 12:15.356
Your prints are on-
-on this murder weapon.

12:20.561 --> 12:21.995
I don't know.

12:21.996 --> 12:23.396
I was recovering from
being really drunk,

12:23.397 --> 12:25.165
And I--I might have picked...

12:25.166 --> 12:27.268
Don't speculate.

12:27.269 --> 12:29.340
Frank, look, you know,

12:29.341 --> 12:33.616
Nothing about this
seems premeditated.

12:33.617 --> 12:34.985
What happened?

12:34.986 --> 12:36.789
A quarrel accelerated beyond words,

12:36.790 --> 12:39.860
And, you know, got physical?

12:39.861 --> 12:41.262
Tell us what happened.

12:41.263 --> 12:42.498
Maybe we can talk about a deal.

12:42.499 --> 12:45.234
We don't talk based
on rampant speculation.

12:45.235 --> 12:48.269
Don't you get it?

12:48.270 --> 12:50.438
I have no future without connor.

12:50.439 --> 12:53.008
I'm not easy, and, um,

12:53.009 --> 12:55.643
And he put up with me.

12:55.644 --> 12:57.445
I loved him.

12:57.446 --> 12:58.746
We hear that a lot.

12:58.747 --> 12:59.747
Really?

12:59.748 --> 13:02.417
Okay. I'm destroyed.

13:02.418 --> 13:04.185
I'm as dead as he is?

13:04.186 --> 13:07.122
You look pretty alive to me.

13:07.123 --> 13:09.157
Yeah, well, patricia
caruso hates me.

13:09.158 --> 13:10.658
And my work.

13:10.659 --> 13:14.961
She'll replace me with some
stefan sagmeister wannabe.

13:14.962 --> 13:19.163
I'm gone. Okay?

13:19.164 --> 13:21.864
I'm a ghost.

13:21.865 --> 13:24.232
While that bitch goddess prevails.

13:40.475 --> 13:43.209
Frank is arrested. Not
just person of interest.

13:43.210 --> 13:45.508
Frank bollinger? Not good.

13:45.509 --> 13:47.707
If he talks, disturbs business,

13:47.708 --> 13:50.075
He upsets people who
must not be upset.

13:50.076 --> 13:53.007
Nobody wants this.

13:58.941 --> 14:00.007
"vile, snouted faces,

14:00.008 --> 14:03.108
"pig-like, with tiny, porcine eyes,

14:03.109 --> 14:05.174
Dead to mercy or consideration."

14:05.175 --> 14:07.846
Patricia hits hard in this
article on the russian mob.

14:07.847 --> 14:10.249
Hmm, pig-like and porcine?

14:10.250 --> 14:12.017
That's the same thing.

14:12.018 --> 14:13.217
That's kind of cheesy writing.

14:13.218 --> 14:15.219
Oh, there's a note at the end.

14:15.220 --> 14:17.120
Says she planned six more.

14:17.121 --> 14:20.289
The mob's role in drugs,
extortion, shylocking.

14:20.290 --> 14:24.025
Well, he hated that,
but look at this.

14:24.026 --> 14:25.426
He--he liked this.

14:25.427 --> 14:27.295
Nothing but accolades.

14:27.296 --> 14:28.797
"original voice.

14:28.798 --> 14:30.932
"fresh take.

14:30.933 --> 14:32.800
Great work, mia."

14:32.801 --> 14:34.035
Huh.

14:34.036 --> 14:36.803
Wonder who's mia.

14:36.804 --> 14:39.338
Connor had some
additional files in storage,

14:39.339 --> 14:41.574
So I sent for them.

14:41.575 --> 14:43.609
Uh, that was my first pass.

14:43.610 --> 14:46.778
Yeah, oh, russian gangsters?

14:46.779 --> 14:49.646
Gee, that's, uh-
that's strong stuff.

14:49.647 --> 14:52.381
Connor didn't quite
share your enthusiasm.

14:52.382 --> 14:55.685
He reduced that series
to a one and done.

14:55.686 --> 14:58.221
I think connor was
afraid of the russians.

14:58.222 --> 15:00.156
Hmm. But not you.

15:00.157 --> 15:02.057
Not writing stuff like that.

15:02.058 --> 15:05.559
My ex-husband is forrest caruso.

15:05.560 --> 15:07.895
Great, great defense attorney.

15:07.896 --> 15:11.197
Uh, he "caruso-fied" the
prosecution witnesses

15:11.198 --> 15:13.098
For the italians.

15:13.099 --> 15:16.468
Oh, wait. Did he-
did he defend the russians?

15:16.469 --> 15:17.735
Gee, that could get, uh...

15:17.736 --> 15:18.936
No.

15:18.937 --> 15:21.704
Forrest said that is a
line he won't cross.

15:21.705 --> 15:24.840
So your work was cut
from seven to one?

15:24.841 --> 15:25.840
Must've hurt.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.975
Well, luckily, I just started.

15:27.976 --> 15:30.410
So I picked myself
up, and I partied.

15:30.411 --> 15:32.378
I got home around 1:00.

15:32.379 --> 15:35.379
That is what you wanted
to ask me, right?

15:35.380 --> 15:37.181
Forrest must have warned you.

15:37.182 --> 15:38.515
Nobody's immune.

15:38.516 --> 15:41.651
My daughter mia and
forrest were both at home.

15:41.652 --> 15:43.252
Mia, yeah.

15:43.253 --> 15:45.353
Hey, what, uh...

15:45.354 --> 15:47.254
What's mia-- does she work here?

15:47.255 --> 15:50.223
She interns two days
a week. Fact checking.

15:50.224 --> 15:53.125
The rest of the time she's at
nyu majoring in journalism.

15:53.126 --> 15:54.560
Wants to be like mom.

15:54.561 --> 15:55.995
We'll see.

15:55.996 --> 15:57.667
Uh-huh.

15:57.668 --> 15:59.504
You know, it's so funny.

15:59.505 --> 16:01.777
My father, he's a psychiatrist.

16:01.778 --> 16:04.579
He wanted me, you know,

16:04.580 --> 16:08.248
Taking notes while other
people were relaxed on a couch.

16:08.249 --> 16:11.952
But, what do you know,
here I am a cop.

16:11.953 --> 16:13.920
Observing behavior?

16:13.921 --> 16:16.189
It's not that far off the mark.

16:20.360 --> 16:22.527
This youtube essay by mia,

16:22.528 --> 16:24.562
A very distinctive voice.

16:24.563 --> 16:26.898
She's developing
quite a fan base.

16:26.899 --> 16:29.767
No, connor's praise
was well deserved.

16:29.768 --> 16:31.702
Mm-hmm. Not just the
kinder, gentler treatment

16:31.703 --> 16:33.637
Of a young journalism intern?

16:33.638 --> 16:35.939
Who might be very attractive?

16:35.940 --> 16:37.407
You think so?

16:37.408 --> 16:39.441
Well, it's obvious you
think her mother, patricia,

16:39.442 --> 16:42.177
Is a bit of a knockout.

16:42.178 --> 16:44.178
Was I that obvious?

16:44.179 --> 16:46.280
So if mia's looks
were in the genes,

16:46.281 --> 16:48.882
Along with a superior talent...

16:48.883 --> 16:50.984
You have a wicked imagination.

16:50.985 --> 16:52.652
I like that in a partner.

16:52.653 --> 16:55.120
The dominant, older man
coddles a young intern?

16:55.121 --> 16:57.055
Not without precedent.

16:57.056 --> 16:58.723
I'd like to meet this mia.

16:58.724 --> 17:00.992
At connor's memorial service,

17:00.993 --> 17:03.127
We can see all of 'em.

17:10.300 --> 17:12.366
Wow. Looking at
patricia and forrest,

17:12.367 --> 17:13.967
You'd never know it
was a bitter divorce.

17:13.968 --> 17:15.568
Yeah, cozy.

17:15.569 --> 17:16.935
Well, I'll bet it
was tough for him

17:16.936 --> 17:19.104
Walking out on her.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.271
I'm guessing she gave
the marching orders,

17:21.272 --> 17:24.007
And now, as is often the
case, heants back in.

17:24.008 --> 17:25.842
Mm-hmm. And how about mia?

17:25.843 --> 17:30.011
I think you were right. She
got the mom's good looks.

17:30.012 --> 17:32.145
Mr. Caruso.

17:32.146 --> 17:33.912
Detective nichols.

17:33.913 --> 17:36.814
This is my partner,
detective stevens.

17:36.815 --> 17:38.250
This is hardly the time.

17:38.251 --> 17:40.453
We have a murder.
You know how it works.

17:40.454 --> 17:42.589
Oh, patty said you
stopped by t office.

17:42.590 --> 17:43.823
Yeah, really?

17:43.824 --> 17:45.057
She was, uh, busy.

17:45.058 --> 17:46.324
I'm surprised she noticed.

17:46.325 --> 17:48.794
Hey, did you happen
to read that stuff

17:48.795 --> 17:51.195
She wrote about the russian mob?

17:51.196 --> 17:53.063
I hate reading about crime.

17:53.064 --> 17:55.433
You two seem very close.

17:55.434 --> 17:57.167
Meaning?

17:57.168 --> 17:59.169
Acrimonious tabloid divorce.

17:59.170 --> 18:00.504
Seeing you together,

18:00.505 --> 18:02.073
Looks like you're
working things out.

18:02.074 --> 18:03.742
Well, patty and
I have a daughter,

18:03.743 --> 18:06.644
So above all else,
we're mindful of that.

18:06.645 --> 18:08.646
You, uh, were with patricia

18:08.647 --> 18:09.914
The night of the murder,

18:09.915 --> 18:11.315
But you didn't go to the party.

18:11.316 --> 18:12.649
Is that right?

18:12.650 --> 18:14.017
Well, it's her scene, not mine.

18:14.018 --> 18:15.852
But, yeah, we spent the
night at her place.

18:15.853 --> 18:18.354
So being so close to patricia,

18:18.355 --> 18:20.389
Did she happen to confide in you

18:20.390 --> 18:22.557
About connor cutting
back her article?

18:22.558 --> 18:25.326
What she confided is
irrelevant, detective.

18:25.327 --> 18:27.528
I have corroborated patty's alibi,

18:27.529 --> 18:28.696
And that's all you need.

18:28.697 --> 18:32.032
So have a nice day.

18:32.033 --> 18:33.366
He's good.

18:33.367 --> 18:35.101
Very slick.

18:35.102 --> 18:36.535
Yeah.

18:36.536 --> 18:39.238
Mob didn't pay him 800
an hour for nothing.

18:49.048 --> 18:52.250
I know who you are.

18:52.251 --> 18:54.551
I've seen your face in magazines.

19:10.135 --> 19:11.601
Yeah, okay.

19:11.602 --> 19:12.602
We're coming out.

19:12.603 --> 19:14.571
That was rikers.

19:14.572 --> 19:18.573
Frank bollinger was
stabbed to death.

19:18.574 --> 19:21.376
He lived long enough to I.
D. His killer.

19:23.378 --> 19:25.045
We know that you
followed frank bollinger

19:25.046 --> 19:26.344
Into the bathing area.

19:26.345 --> 19:28.678
Video surveillance picked you up.

19:28.679 --> 19:31.045
But no cameras in showers.

19:31.046 --> 19:32.113
You have nothing.

19:32.114 --> 19:33.947
We have frank's description.

19:33.948 --> 19:37.450
Plus the cos found
this under your bunk.

19:39.186 --> 19:40.853
Everyone has shank.

19:40.854 --> 19:41.921
Protection.

19:41.922 --> 19:44.323
Why did you kill frank bollinger?

19:44.324 --> 19:48.026
It was somebody who
hates queers, not me.

19:48.027 --> 19:49.661
I don't hate anybody.

19:49.662 --> 19:52.930
In russia, you're wanted
on multiple murder charges,

19:52.931 --> 19:54.431
Ivankov.

19:54.432 --> 19:56.166
You're a hired gun.

19:56.167 --> 19:58.001
No, you're mistaken.

19:58.002 --> 20:02.105
I'm a pest exterminator.

20:02.106 --> 20:04.106
So the murder of connor james

20:04.107 --> 20:06.141
Made frank bollinger a pest?

20:06.142 --> 20:07.609
Who?

20:07.610 --> 20:08.677
You expect us to believe

20:08.678 --> 20:10.078
You didn't know frank was a suspect

20:10.079 --> 20:11.246
In connor james' murder?

20:11.247 --> 20:14.182
I only know I went
to shower to get clean.

20:14.183 --> 20:16.617
To not smell.

20:17.619 --> 20:21.589
Doesn't always work.

20:21.590 --> 20:23.791
Ivankov...

20:23.792 --> 20:27.662
You tell us who ordered the
hit on frank bollinger,

20:27.663 --> 20:30.631
You might not end
up in the supermax.

20:30.632 --> 20:33.233
You have just suspicion.

20:33.234 --> 20:34.901
No evidence.

20:34.902 --> 20:37.404
I've been extradited,

20:37.405 --> 20:41.141
And you cannot stop it.

20:41.142 --> 20:43.243
He's right.

20:43.244 --> 20:45.112
Mr. Ivankov does have
some frequent flyer miles

20:45.113 --> 20:46.946
Coming his way.

20:46.947 --> 20:51.248
State department is honoring
moscow's petition to extradite.

20:51.249 --> 20:53.716
So let's run this thing
again from the top.

20:53.717 --> 20:55.684
We have a professional hit

20:55.685 --> 20:59.251
Possibly related to patricia's
piece on the russian mob.

20:59.252 --> 21:02.721
Well, she said that connor
was afraid of the russians.

21:02.722 --> 21:04.523
I don't think he was that afraid.

21:04.524 --> 21:05.924
I noticed he only edited things

21:05.925 --> 21:07.992
That related to the
mob's sex rings.

21:07.993 --> 21:10.026
The rest, the names of
mobsters, their connections,

21:10.027 --> 21:11.462
It's all in here.

21:11.463 --> 21:13.229
So all we really know
about frank bollinger

21:13.230 --> 21:14.730
Is that he designed a lousy cover

21:14.731 --> 21:16.131
And ended up dead.

21:16.132 --> 21:18.366
No, obviously he did more.

21:18.367 --> 21:21.234
I got to get o.C.C.B. In on this.

21:21.235 --> 21:24.971
Bollinger and connor's
murder are somehow connected.

21:24.972 --> 21:26.539
And are we agreed?

21:26.540 --> 21:29.275
Connor was straight?

21:29.276 --> 21:32.445
Women know about these things.

21:32.446 --> 21:35.581
I say we go talk to another
woman who's close to him.

21:35.582 --> 21:38.616
No, mr. Connor? No, not gay.

21:38.617 --> 21:40.117
At all.

21:40.118 --> 21:41.351
You sound pretty sure.

21:41.352 --> 21:44.621
Mr. Connor was
always with the girls.

21:44.622 --> 21:47.690
Always.

21:47.691 --> 21:50.459
Say, this chest...

21:50.460 --> 21:53.395
This was not here when we searched.

21:53.396 --> 21:54.996
Mr. Connor put all
this in the basement,

21:54.997 --> 21:56.798
Make room for the party.

22:01.471 --> 22:05.642
He definitely wasn't into guys.

22:05.643 --> 22:07.210
"love, laura."

22:07.211 --> 22:11.314
They autographed the backs.

22:11.315 --> 22:14.017
Hmm.

22:14.018 --> 22:15.785
<i>Zen yoga.</i>

22:15.786 --> 22:17.854
<i>The art of fly fishing.</i>

22:17.855 --> 22:20.857
<i>Ten ways to a stronger marriage.</i>

22:26.430 --> 22:28.664
Oh.

22:28.665 --> 22:29.799
Mm-hmm.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.299
Mm-hmm.

22:31.300 --> 22:33.264
Home sex videos?

22:35.798 --> 22:38.263
More girls. All young.

22:38.264 --> 22:42.498
Yeah, they look like prostitutes.

22:42.499 --> 22:45.100
How'd he find 'em?

22:45.101 --> 22:47.368
Maybe by taking risks.

22:47.369 --> 22:51.471
More people with a
motive to kill him.

22:51.472 --> 22:54.240
Here's connor playing
the aging lothario.

22:54.241 --> 22:56.575
And he tapes all this.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.309
Sleaze bag.

22:58.310 --> 23:00.244
Wait, how old are you?

23:00.245 --> 23:01.511
What?

23:01.512 --> 23:03.546
I'm paying top dollar for youth.

23:03.547 --> 23:05.314
Sorry, sweetheart.
You don't qualify.

23:05.315 --> 23:07.549
Please, my boss will be mad.

23:07.550 --> 23:11.786
Mm-hmm. What do you get? 5,000?

23:11.787 --> 23:13.887
This guy was all heart.

23:13.888 --> 23:15.856
Come on, come on.
Come on, I'm a busy man.

23:15.857 --> 23:17.524
Let's go, get out. Get out!

23:17.525 --> 23:18.959
Right, bye-bye.

23:18.960 --> 23:21.427
Frankie! Frankie, you
just cost me five grand!

23:21.428 --> 23:23.630
Yeah, I need another girl.

23:23.631 --> 23:26.302
Frank--frank, not now
with the art layout.

23:30.276 --> 23:33.612
Frank bollinger was
his conduit to hookers.

23:33.613 --> 23:34.846
Girls with accents.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.315
Probably victims of
human trafficking

23:36.316 --> 23:38.150
Brought in by the russian mob.

23:38.151 --> 23:39.984
Maybe he did the heavy
edit on patricia's piece

23:39.985 --> 23:42.053
'cause he was afraid
his name would show up.

23:42.054 --> 23:44.822
So did the mob, though,
do the heavy edit on him,

23:44.823 --> 23:46.889
Or was it enough just
to kill frank bollinger

23:46.890 --> 23:49.655
Who hooked connor up?

23:49.656 --> 23:53.457
I think he hooked up
with this one on his own.

23:53.458 --> 23:56.893
Mia.

23:56.894 --> 23:59.128
I wonder if mom knows
that her daughter

23:59.129 --> 24:01.597
Was doing more than
just fact checking.

24:05.034 --> 24:06.634
Yes?

24:06.635 --> 24:08.269
Mrs. Caruso, can we come in?

24:08.270 --> 24:10.203
It's about your daughter.

24:10.204 --> 24:11.705
We want to speak to her.

24:11.706 --> 24:13.373
It's important.

24:13.374 --> 24:15.207
I was just about to leave.

24:15.208 --> 24:17.542
I have a pen dinner in midtown,

24:17.543 --> 24:22.378
And mia is still struggling
with connor's death.

24:22.379 --> 24:24.013
So are we.

24:24.014 --> 24:25.747
You're aware your daughter

24:25.748 --> 24:27.982
Was sexually involved with connor?

24:27.983 --> 24:30.517
What? How dare you?

24:30.518 --> 24:31.818
Patricia, come on.

24:31.819 --> 24:35.788
Connor james, also a big
fan of young prostitutes.

24:35.789 --> 24:37.722
Gonna tell me that
that was a big secret?

24:37.723 --> 24:40.724
Yeah. And the russian
mob was supplying 'em.

24:40.725 --> 24:42.992
You didn't uncover that in
your journalistic endeavors?

24:42.993 --> 24:44.693
Hi, counselor.

24:44.694 --> 24:48.231
Well, maybe that explains
why he butchered your piece,

24:48.232 --> 24:49.566
Patricia.

24:49.567 --> 24:52.136
He also recorded
his exploits on dvds.

24:52.137 --> 24:53.571
Quite a collection.

24:53.572 --> 24:56.107
That sick son of a bitch.

24:56.108 --> 24:58.143
Don't tell me our daughter...

24:58.144 --> 25:00.479
You're really saying
that you weren't aware

25:00.480 --> 25:03.148
Of mia's involvement with him?

25:03.149 --> 25:06.050
We're not answering
anymore questions.

25:06.051 --> 25:07.985
Okay.

25:07.986 --> 25:10.053
So we should talk to mia.

25:10.054 --> 25:12.790
Is she under arrest?

25:12.791 --> 25:14.358
No.

25:14.359 --> 25:15.826
Then you know the drill.

25:15.827 --> 25:17.628
This is a family thing.

25:17.629 --> 25:19.997
Leave us alone.

25:24.625 --> 25:26.825
Not an arrest. I
can't endorse that.

25:26.826 --> 25:28.226
You want forrest caruso brought in,

25:28.227 --> 25:30.128
You do it on a material
witness warrant.

25:30.129 --> 25:31.662
But an arrest is the only way

25:31.663 --> 25:34.097
We isolate him from
patricia and mia

25:34.098 --> 25:35.365
While we question them.

25:35.366 --> 25:36.699
Probable cause?

25:36.700 --> 25:39.400
These phone records
cover us on that.

25:39.401 --> 25:41.502
Mia's phone is in
her father's name.

25:41.503 --> 25:43.737
Ergo her records are his records.

25:43.738 --> 25:45.805
Here's a text we downloaded
from connor's phone,

25:45.806 --> 25:47.806
Sent to mia during the party.

25:47.807 --> 25:49.307
That's interesting,

25:49.308 --> 25:51.581
But it doesn't prove forrest
knew about the affair.

25:51.582 --> 25:53.283
Unless he scanned his
daughter's phone.

25:53.284 --> 25:55.018
Not something I haven't done.

25:55.019 --> 25:57.019
Your kid's eight.

25:57.020 --> 25:59.021
By the time she's 18, you might
want to back off on that.

25:59.022 --> 26:00.889
There's more.

26:00.890 --> 26:02.190
Oh, yeah, this.

26:02.191 --> 26:03.992
Yeah, yeah, yeah, 2:13 a.M.,

26:03.993 --> 26:06.427
Mia called her father.

26:06.428 --> 26:08.262
That's the same time
connor was murdered.

26:08.263 --> 26:09.596
Time when patricia and forrest

26:09.597 --> 26:11.631
Claim they were home with mia.

26:11.632 --> 26:13.800
In the same house, so why call?

26:13.801 --> 26:15.201
What if they weren't
in the same house?

26:15.202 --> 26:19.870
What if mia went to
connor's after the party,

26:19.871 --> 26:22.605
Finds out about the other girls...

26:22.606 --> 26:23.939
Completely loses it.

26:23.940 --> 26:25.573
Panics and calls her dad?

26:25.574 --> 26:27.407
Forrest comes to cover it up.

26:27.408 --> 26:29.577
Frames frank bollinger,
who's there, passed out.

26:29.578 --> 26:32.380
oh, I don't know.

26:32.381 --> 26:35.816
Oh. Rogers has something.

26:35.817 --> 26:38.352
Remember the
lacerations on his hands?

26:38.353 --> 26:39.886
They form a radiating pattern,

26:39.887 --> 26:43.089
Something he clenched
at the instant of death.

26:43.090 --> 26:45.024
Oh, look at that.

26:45.025 --> 26:46.591
Do you have any idea what that is?

26:46.592 --> 26:47.959
Oh, it's something
square and sharp.

26:47.960 --> 26:49.894
The cuts are clean.

26:49.895 --> 26:52.663
And he had it in his hand

26:52.664 --> 26:57.067
For 25 to 30 minutes after he died.

26:57.068 --> 26:58.835
You sure about that?

26:58.836 --> 27:00.569
Sometimes the victim's hand

27:00.570 --> 27:02.671
Has to be literally pried open.

27:02.672 --> 27:04.205
Why kill him and wait 25 minutes

27:04.206 --> 27:06.740
Before removing whatever it was?

27:12.547 --> 27:14.147
What are you doing?

27:14.148 --> 27:17.884
I'm, uh, seeing
what this looks like.

27:17.885 --> 27:20.720
Trying to connect the dots.

27:20.721 --> 27:22.955
Odd shape. Distinctive.

27:22.956 --> 27:24.289
Yeah, what do you think?

27:24.290 --> 27:27.792
Warrants for forrest,
patricia, and mia?

27:27.793 --> 27:30.094
Mia? This better be good.

27:30.095 --> 27:31.429
Forrest caruso eats red meat.

27:31.430 --> 27:33.397
You arrest his daughter,
he'll be out to eat us.

27:33.398 --> 27:35.065
No, no, no, we'll be okay.

27:35.066 --> 27:37.300
Serena lit a candle.

27:42.638 --> 27:44.138
Why can't my dad be here?

27:44.139 --> 27:46.840
We're saying nothing
until he gets here.

27:46.841 --> 27:51.177
Your father is, uh, in custody.

27:51.178 --> 27:53.746
Forrest has been arrested?

27:53.747 --> 27:55.914
What the hell is this about?

27:55.915 --> 27:58.083
Possible accessory
after the fact.

27:58.084 --> 27:59.184
What?

27:59.185 --> 28:00.619
We believe he
helped your daughter

28:00.620 --> 28:02.053
Cover up the murder
of connor james.

28:02.054 --> 28:05.189
Uh, no. I didn't kill connor.

28:05.190 --> 28:06.957
You called your
father from connor's

28:06.958 --> 28:08.658
At 2:00 a.M. On the
night of the murder.

28:08.659 --> 28:10.327
No, I wasn't there.

28:10.328 --> 28:12.762
She was at home with
her father and myself.

28:12.763 --> 28:16.766
Mrs. Caruso, mia's cell
phone records and gps

28:16.767 --> 28:18.134
Tracks her to connor's.

28:18.135 --> 28:19.902
It's not true.

28:19.903 --> 28:24.040
How can they have this?

28:24.041 --> 28:25.274
Sweetheart, we will--

28:25.275 --> 28:27.408
No! I want my father.

28:27.409 --> 28:29.043
I don't want you handling anything.

28:29.044 --> 28:31.044
He was murdered because of
that crap that you wrote.

28:31.045 --> 28:32.477
What?

28:32.478 --> 28:33.912
She made him a
target for mobsters.

28:33.913 --> 28:35.779
Mia, we're going to hold
you pending arraignment.

28:40.151 --> 28:43.851
W--what's going on?

28:43.852 --> 28:46.187
I'm telling the truth. -
Hands behind your back.

28:46.188 --> 28:48.123
Please!

28:49.291 --> 28:51.292
Don't do this.

28:51.293 --> 28:53.060
But I didn't hurt anyone. Please.

28:53.061 --> 28:55.528
This is all wrong. Mom. Mom!

28:55.529 --> 28:57.163
Miss caruso.

29:01.403 --> 29:02.804
You know my feelings about this.

29:02.805 --> 29:03.872
Uh, yes, but--

29:03.873 --> 29:05.173
It verges on breaking rules,

29:05.174 --> 29:06.307
So whether it works
or doesn't work,

29:06.308 --> 29:07.508
You make it fast.

29:07.509 --> 29:10.978
My husband is gonna
tear your throat out.

29:10.979 --> 29:13.147
Treating our baby like a criminal.

29:13.148 --> 29:15.650
We're aware of the
mitigating factors.

29:15.651 --> 29:17.351
Connor's age, her age,

29:17.352 --> 29:19.888
It could qualify as
voluntary manslaughter.

29:19.889 --> 29:21.390
And, um, you know,

29:21.391 --> 29:24.226
It could even plead down
to negligent homicide.

29:24.227 --> 29:26.762
You know, she does a
suspended sentence.

29:26.763 --> 29:28.030
No time at all.

29:28.031 --> 29:33.067
I suppose you
have proof beyond...

29:33.068 --> 29:34.999
My poor baby.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.735
Well, you know, she's
only 17 years old,

29:37.736 --> 29:41.071
And she comes from a good home

29:41.072 --> 29:43.707
And responsible, loving parents.

29:43.708 --> 29:45.376
That bastard, connor!

29:45.377 --> 29:47.645
I tried to warn her away from him,

29:47.646 --> 29:51.681
And she just wouldn't listen.

29:51.682 --> 29:54.450
You weren't aware
of the actual affair.

29:54.451 --> 29:57.652
Of course not.

29:57.653 --> 29:59.486
I saw a crush developing,

29:59.487 --> 30:01.254
But I never thought
it would come to this.

30:01.255 --> 30:04.655
To mia's killing him.

30:04.656 --> 30:07.956
When I heard about his death,

30:07.957 --> 30:09.990
And she wasn't in
our home that night,

30:09.991 --> 30:13.925
I thought, "oh, god, please
don't let it be true."

30:19.563 --> 30:22.899
Whatever she did, she
is really not to blame.

30:25.669 --> 30:30.437
You've been very...Helpful.

30:35.475 --> 30:37.442
Detectives, they've
brought mr. Caruso.

30:42.381 --> 30:46.049
This is to verify that
he got the call from mia.

30:46.050 --> 30:47.850
He won't accept it.

30:47.851 --> 30:50.552
He is not ready.

30:54.423 --> 30:56.658
We're gonna have to
cue patricia's testimony

30:56.659 --> 30:58.759
To the exact right spot.

30:58.760 --> 31:00.328
If forrest gets even a whiff--

31:00.329 --> 31:02.829
Of how we worked her,
worked her daughter.

31:02.830 --> 31:05.331
We've destroyed a relationship
between a mother and daughter.

31:05.332 --> 31:07.633
This isn't easy for me.

31:07.634 --> 31:11.036
Okay. I can go it alone.

31:11.037 --> 31:13.238
You're being noble,
which means even you think

31:13.239 --> 31:15.006
This could really go wrong.

31:15.007 --> 31:17.775
Like a possible career-ender?

31:17.776 --> 31:20.745
Tell her. It's only fair.

31:20.746 --> 31:22.213
The captain's right.

31:22.214 --> 31:24.782
L-let's talk.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.488
You heard patricia's testimony.

31:30.489 --> 31:33.157
We follow through on that,
this can all be put to rest.

31:33.158 --> 31:35.226
Not so long ago,
I heard testimony

31:35.227 --> 31:37.094
Possibly involving the russian mob.

31:37.095 --> 31:38.462
But that's gone away.

31:38.463 --> 31:39.830
Now we have an absolute admission.

31:39.831 --> 31:41.899
No, don't call it an admission.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.301
It's an accusation.

31:43.302 --> 31:44.670
In the d.A.'s hands,

31:44.671 --> 31:46.005
What patricia just said in there

31:46.006 --> 31:47.439
Could get an innocent
girl convicted of murder.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.008
But we're not
bringing in the d.A.

31:49.009 --> 31:50.476
That's not our choice.

31:50.477 --> 31:52.645
If patricia suddenly
decides to lawyer up,

31:52.646 --> 31:54.847
She'll be in the grand jury
indicting her daughter,

31:54.848 --> 31:56.282
And you'll both be transit cops.

31:56.283 --> 31:58.818
But we have no choice, none.

31:58.819 --> 32:01.387
I meant what I said
about going it alone.

32:01.388 --> 32:04.357
But the only way is forward.

32:04.358 --> 32:07.360
He has a terrible
way of being right.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.455
When you spoke to
her, did she sound high?

32:13.456 --> 32:15.690
My daughter's too
smart to do drugs,

32:15.691 --> 32:17.659
And I've not said I spoke to her.

32:17.660 --> 32:18.994
Uh, you do realize

32:18.995 --> 32:21.829
That every cell phone
has a gps, which--

32:21.830 --> 32:24.131
Which can be tracked
from various towers.

32:24.132 --> 32:26.066
It's not infallible.

32:26.067 --> 32:29.201
I've got experts who can and
will refute that evidence.

32:29.202 --> 32:31.070
Okay, I suppose our next question

32:31.071 --> 32:32.639
Is gonna be whether or not

32:32.640 --> 32:36.209
You'll refute the
testimony of your ex-wife?

32:36.210 --> 32:37.845
What?

32:37.846 --> 32:40.148
I understand a father being
protective of his daughter,

32:40.149 --> 32:44.654
But your ex-wife is being
more realistic about it.

32:44.655 --> 32:47.491
You weren't aware
of an actual affair?

32:47.492 --> 32:49.727
Of course not.

32:49.728 --> 32:51.295
I--I could see a crush developing,

32:51.296 --> 32:53.964
But I never thought
it would come to this.

32:53.965 --> 32:57.701
To mia killing him?

32:57.702 --> 33:01.504
When I heard about his death,

33:01.505 --> 33:03.705
And she wasn't in our
home that night...

33:03.706 --> 33:06.274
- Ah!
- I thought, "oh, god, please,

33:06.275 --> 33:07.508
Don't let it be true."

33:07.509 --> 33:08.509
Okay, stop this.

33:08.510 --> 33:09.544
Mia is innocent.

33:09.545 --> 33:11.913
- Patricia says--
- stop!

33:17.918 --> 33:19.818
Counselor, we've got, uh--

33:19.819 --> 33:21.753
I'm not gonna try
to explain evidence

33:21.754 --> 33:23.755
To you of all people, but look.

33:23.756 --> 33:25.923
I've got mia's phone
records right here.

33:25.924 --> 33:26.924
It's on your account.

33:26.925 --> 33:28.292
Here in this highlighted part

33:28.293 --> 33:31.226
Is the call itself
from connor to you.

33:31.227 --> 33:33.761
You don't know who made it.

33:33.762 --> 33:38.567
Well, uh, what jury would
believe that it wasn't mia,

33:38.568 --> 33:40.969
What with the testimony
of her own mother?

33:44.073 --> 33:47.174
My daughter can't go down
for something she didn't do.

33:53.113 --> 33:57.482
Patty was frantic.

33:57.483 --> 34:00.184
She'd fought with connor.

34:00.185 --> 34:03.954
She hit him with something
during a struggle.

34:03.955 --> 34:05.588
She panicked.

34:05.589 --> 34:08.023
Naturally, she called me.

34:08.024 --> 34:12.360
And you went to help her.

34:12.360 --> 34:14.629
Understand, it was
patty's reaction

34:14.630 --> 34:17.231
To finding out the man
violated our daughter.

34:17.232 --> 34:19.699
There was more than one blow.

34:19.699 --> 34:21.699
No.

34:24.036 --> 34:25.637
Not patty. Me.

34:25.638 --> 34:27.672
You?

34:30.810 --> 34:33.445
When I got there,

34:33.446 --> 34:35.580
Patty's earring was in his hand,

34:35.581 --> 34:37.581
And he wouldn't let go.

34:37.583 --> 34:40.051
Suddenly, he moved.

34:40.052 --> 34:43.585
I reacted. I slammed his
head against the floor.

34:43.587 --> 34:45.987
Finished him off.

34:45.987 --> 34:50.190
I checked his heart.

34:50.192 --> 34:52.426
And he was dead.

34:55.295 --> 34:57.531
Patty didn't kill him.

35:04.506 --> 35:06.941
I did.

35:16.850 --> 35:18.750
We'll be processing your release.

35:18.751 --> 35:20.151
So you know I'm innocent?

35:20.152 --> 35:24.187
Your father gave us a statement.

35:24.188 --> 35:27.357
He killed connor.

35:27.358 --> 35:30.459
He...And your mother.

35:37.067 --> 35:39.803
She reacted to the news you
were sleeping with him,

35:39.804 --> 35:42.206
And acted out of rage, and...

35:42.207 --> 35:44.508
It's my fault for being
with connor, anyway.

35:44.509 --> 35:45.943
No, it's not your fault.

35:45.944 --> 35:47.311
Don't believe that.

35:47.312 --> 35:51.982
Why should I believe
you about anything?

35:51.983 --> 35:56.019
Detective.

35:56.020 --> 35:58.820
We're not letting her go
until we're all finished.

36:01.220 --> 36:02.852
- She's a 17
-year-old girl.

36:02.853 --> 36:03.986
We accused her of murder.

36:03.987 --> 36:05.485
She's alone in a holding cell.

36:05.486 --> 36:06.684
Yeah, where she's gonna stay

36:06.685 --> 36:09.286
Until the voided arrest process.

36:09.287 --> 36:10.721
That's what we do.

36:10.722 --> 36:12.522
If frank's statement
will get it to trial,

36:12.523 --> 36:14.558
There's nothing left for us to do.

36:14.559 --> 36:16.493
Understand her intent.

36:16.494 --> 36:18.061
Patricia's intent?

36:18.062 --> 36:20.530
As a mother, I can almost get
my head around her intent.

36:20.531 --> 36:23.000
No, you can't. She's not you.

36:23.001 --> 36:24.401
You know, you should
have been a shrink

36:24.402 --> 36:26.537
Like your father wanted.

36:29.040 --> 36:33.777
Serena, I don't care
about complaining husbands

36:33.778 --> 36:35.112
And cheating wives

36:35.113 --> 36:36.747
And treating people
with nervous acne.

36:36.748 --> 36:39.817
But I am driven to understand

36:39.818 --> 36:42.587
Why some people are so different

36:42.588 --> 36:44.255
That they disrupt our sense

36:44.256 --> 36:45.757
Of all behavior and logic.

36:45.758 --> 36:47.892
And you'll do whatever it takes.

36:47.893 --> 36:50.728
I don't buy that patricia

36:50.729 --> 36:52.997
Killed to protect her child.

36:52.998 --> 36:54.398
Why not?

36:54.399 --> 36:56.833
It's not who she is.

36:56.834 --> 37:00.236
And who is she?

37:00.237 --> 37:02.672
We don't know.

37:09.578 --> 37:11.546
Ms. Caruso,

37:11.547 --> 37:14.582
Your husband has
told us everything--

37:14.583 --> 37:17.719
How you called him from connor's

37:17.720 --> 37:19.688
On mia's phone.

37:19.689 --> 37:21.690
Don't blame him for lying.

37:21.691 --> 37:23.726
He is desperate to save mia.

37:23.727 --> 37:24.827
I mean, maybe he's right.

37:24.828 --> 37:26.462
Maybe we should sacrifice ourselves

37:26.463 --> 37:29.099
For the sake of our child.

37:29.100 --> 37:32.769
Miss caruso, this tells us

37:32.770 --> 37:36.106
That you were present
when connor died.

37:36.107 --> 37:39.609
He cut his hand...

37:39.610 --> 37:43.346
Clutching... At this earring.

37:46.750 --> 37:50.620
Observe, if you will.

37:50.621 --> 37:52.789
You see that?

37:53.891 --> 37:56.125
See that?

37:56.126 --> 37:57.894
Same...

37:57.895 --> 38:00.897
I've noticed since then
you've worn clip-ons.

38:00.898 --> 38:02.532
Would you remove them?

38:11.175 --> 38:13.877
So when you struggled,

38:13.878 --> 38:16.980
Connor pulled this
earring out of your ear.

38:23.320 --> 38:26.823
- Okay, so what-
- what happened that night?

38:26.824 --> 38:31.193
You, um, somehow wound
up with mia's cell phone,

38:31.194 --> 38:34.762
And you intercepted a text message

38:34.763 --> 38:38.299
From connor that was meant for mia.

38:38.300 --> 38:39.901
Filth.

38:39.902 --> 38:41.603
He bragged.

38:41.604 --> 38:43.740
He described mia's first orgasm

38:43.741 --> 38:47.945
In lugubrious detail.

38:47.946 --> 38:51.714
But we have the text right here,

38:51.715 --> 38:55.317
Ms. Caruso.

38:55.318 --> 38:56.952
This is what he wrote.

38:56.953 --> 38:59.320
"your words, style,
and structure, mia,

38:59.321 --> 39:02.056
"are gifts touched by god's wand.

39:02.057 --> 39:04.525
"nothing is owed to a mother

39:04.526 --> 39:07.527
Who has suppressed and
denied your talent."

39:07.528 --> 39:09.128
Filth?

39:09.129 --> 39:11.763
Considering the purpose,
I'll stick with "filth."

39:14.463 --> 39:16.396
Even I would have to admit

39:16.397 --> 39:21.498
That mia's writing is not
only superior to yours, but--

39:21.499 --> 39:23.032
You're a cop.

39:23.033 --> 39:24.867
You can't judge what I create.

39:24.868 --> 39:29.039
I don't care what you think.

39:29.040 --> 39:31.174
But you did care...

39:31.175 --> 39:34.908
What connor thought, didn't you?

39:34.909 --> 39:38.041
<i>Connor wanted le mot
juste. Flaubert.</i>

39:38.042 --> 39:39.575
Sylvia plath.

39:39.576 --> 39:40.942
I write tough.

39:40.943 --> 39:42.709
<i>Not the sop you see on oprah.</i>

39:42.710 --> 39:46.709
It sells. That is why
I'm running the place.

39:46.710 --> 39:50.244
Don't you feel that
mia has a special gift?

39:50.245 --> 39:53.713
Connor said what
he said to get laid.

39:53.714 --> 39:57.014
A decade ago, I learned
exactly how he works.

40:02.223 --> 40:04.692
Okay, you want the whole story?

40:04.693 --> 40:07.994
I didn't kill connor. Forrest did.

40:07.995 --> 40:10.194
But you struck him
before forrest got there.

40:10.195 --> 40:11.595
Yeah, but when forrest got there,

40:11.596 --> 40:12.595
Connor moved.

40:12.596 --> 40:14.495
Forrest and I both saw it.

40:14.496 --> 40:16.029
So forrest took his head,

40:16.030 --> 40:18.029
And he slammed it into the floor.

40:18.030 --> 40:19.662
And he never moved again.

40:19.663 --> 40:21.495
That was a muscle contraction.

40:21.496 --> 40:24.363
That's a function of rigor mortis.

40:24.364 --> 40:27.928
Your blow actually did
kill connor james.

40:27.929 --> 40:31.895
And for reasons that
are far less noble

40:31.896 --> 40:35.330
Than you'd like us to think.

40:35.331 --> 40:39.565
You've gone from a mother
trying to frame her daughter

40:39.566 --> 40:42.567
To accusing the ex-husband
who still loves you.

40:48.235 --> 40:50.435
I think patricia

40:50.436 --> 40:53.537
Is finally starting
to arrive at reality.

41:01.074 --> 41:04.076
It's time she heard her rights.

41:21.759 --> 41:23.993
You're a stickler
for behavioral theory.

41:23.994 --> 41:25.361
Listen to this.

41:25.362 --> 41:26.996
"these individuals can have

41:26.997 --> 41:28.897
"a grandiose view of themselves,

41:28.898 --> 41:31.033
"and demand excessive admiration.

41:31.034 --> 41:33.402
"they maneuver well in
difficult situations,

41:33.403 --> 41:35.436
"but their self-esteem is fragile.

41:35.437 --> 41:37.672
"any threat to their self-image

41:37.673 --> 41:41.408
Might agitate or even enrage them."

41:41.409 --> 41:44.240
Oh, that's right out
of the psych textbook.

41:44.241 --> 41:47.037
Yeah, narcissistic
personality disorder.

41:47.038 --> 41:48.434
It's a psychopathology

41:48.435 --> 41:50.999
That fits our patricia to a "t".

41:51.000 --> 41:53.898
Or a sign of the zodiac.

41:53.899 --> 41:57.233
She's a scorpio.

41:57.234 --> 41:59.001
Yeah.

41:59.002 --> 42:02.303
Well, you know, my father
would kill me for saying this,

42:02.304 --> 42:04.905
But, uh...

42:04.906 --> 42:06.672
Equally valid.
