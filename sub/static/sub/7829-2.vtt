00:41.291 --> 00:43.835
Aw, all these new
superheroes suck.

00:43.918 --> 00:44.836
None of them
can hold a candle

00:44.919 --> 00:46.129
to Radioactive Man.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.757
The only decent new one
is Radiation Dude.

00:48.840 --> 00:51.009
Naw, he's just a cheap imitation
of Radioactive Man.

00:51.092 --> 00:52.177
Explain.

00:52.260 --> 00:54.888
The similarities
are subtle but many.

00:54.971 --> 00:57.557
For example, Radioactive Man
has his famous catchphrase

00:57.640 --> 00:59.142
"Up and atom!"

00:59.225 --> 01:02.062
with "atom" spelled a-t-o-m
in a delicious pun.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.396
Go on.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.731
While Radiation Dude

01:04.814 --> 01:07.192
has a similar
but lamer catchphrase,

01:07.275 --> 01:08.902
"Up and let's go."

01:08.985 --> 01:11.196
So you kids fancy
yourselves experts, eh?

01:11.279 --> 01:14.032
Well, between us,
we've read all 814 issues

01:14.115 --> 01:15.950
of Radioactive Man.

01:16.034 --> 01:16.993
Yeah, and we both
have the special

01:17.077 --> 01:18.620
limited edition issue

01:18.703 --> 01:21.414
where he and fallout boy
get killed on every page!

01:21.498 --> 01:23.917
Well, I suppose you know then
that Hollywood is planning

01:24.000 --> 01:25.794
a feature film
about Radioactive Man.

01:25.877 --> 01:26.961
(gasping)

01:27.045 --> 01:28.338
I have got
to do something

01:28.421 --> 01:29.798
about that air
conditioner suction.

01:29.881 --> 01:31.883
Who's going to play
Radioactive Man?

01:31.966 --> 01:34.928
I will tell you
in exactly seven minutes.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.892
Okay, here we are.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.166
I don't see why
Rainier Wolfcastle

02:05.250 --> 02:06.501
should be the star.

02:06.584 --> 02:09.879
I think we should
bring back Dirk Richter.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.423
Kids will want to see
the original Radioactive Man.

02:12.507 --> 02:13.925
I keep telling you--

02:14.008 --> 02:16.636
He's 73 years old,
and he's dead.

02:16.719 --> 02:17.971
Granted, but--

02:18.054 --> 02:19.472
Besides, we want to stay
as far away

02:19.556 --> 02:22.851
from the campy '70s
version as possible.

02:22.934 --> 02:25.311
Billowing backpacks,
Radioactive Man!

02:25.395 --> 02:27.147
It's the worst villain
of them all!

02:27.230 --> 02:29.357
The Scoutmaster!

02:29.440 --> 02:31.276
I see him, Fallout Boy.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.153
(a la Paul Lynde)
Go get them, scouts.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.830
Don't be afraid to use
your nails, boys.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.858
So, where could we
shoot this picture?

03:11.941 --> 03:14.652
We need a city that has
a nuclear reactor and a gorge,

03:14.736 --> 03:16.654
and can guarantee us
the full corporation

03:16.738 --> 03:18.072
of city officials.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.325
I'll check Variety.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.996
Wow!
Look at that ad!

03:27.373 --> 03:28.875
All right,
this place must be hot.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.419
They don't need a big ad
or even correct spelling.

03:31.502 --> 03:33.296
I agree
with that logic.

03:33.379 --> 03:34.464
Get me two plane tickets

03:34.547 --> 03:35.590

that Springfield is in.

03:38.384 --> 03:40.428
All right, we have
$30 million to spend.

03:40.511 --> 03:43.056
We'll blow up our dams,
destroy forests, anything.

03:43.139 --> 03:45.475
If there's a species of animal
that's causing you problems,

03:45.558 --> 03:46.935

03:47.018 --> 03:48.353
we'll have it wiped out!

03:48.436 --> 03:50.146
Look, we just want
to make movies,

03:50.230 --> 03:51.940

for me to look in that
exhaust pipe every time

05:29.579 --> 05:31.748

09:34.782 --> 09:36.742
How will you pay

09:36.826 --> 09:39.120
I'm sorry,

09:47.211 --> 09:48.671
George Burns was right.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.424
Show business is
a hideous bitch goddess.

09:51.507 --> 09:52.967
Cheer up, Bart.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.802
Milhouse is still going
to need a true friend.

09:54.885 --> 09:57.805
Someone to tell him he's great,
someone to rub lotion on him

09:57.888 --> 09:59.599
someone he can hurl
whiskey bottles at

09:59.682 --> 10:00.891
when he's feeling low.

10:00.975 --> 10:03.352
You're right, Lis.
I can suck up to him

10:03.436 --> 10:05.688
like the religious people
suck up to God.

10:05.771 --> 10:06.731

$50 a day

10:10.026 --> 10:11.902

of the movie here.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.113

through here.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.241

10:33.424 --> 10:35.551
Why don't you get something
to eat from our food truck?

10:35.635 --> 10:37.136
(distant panting)

10:37.219 --> 10:38.471
Mr. Simpson?

10:40.640 --> 10:44.060
You've got to give me
the part of "Krispy the Klown."

10:44.143 --> 10:46.145
I'm sorry.
You're wrong for the part.

10:46.228 --> 10:48.522
But look at my range.

10:53.569 --> 10:56.072
I'm sorry. "Krispy the Klown"
has been cast

10:56.155 --> 10:58.532
but I will hire you
for "Angry the Clown,"

10:58.616 --> 11:00.785
"Silly Sailor,"
and "Dr. Clowneous."

11:01.911 --> 11:03.746
I won't let you down.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.165
Well, I might let you down
on "Silly Sailor."

11:11.879 --> 11:14.048
Up and atom.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.633
Up and at them.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.635
Up and atom!

11:17.718 --> 11:18.844
Up and at them!

11:18.928 --> 11:20.596
Up and atom!

11:20.680 --> 11:21.847
Up and at them!

11:21.931 --> 11:22.890
Better.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.642
Hi, Milhouse.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.185
Hey, I want you to know

11:26.268 --> 11:28.020
that I'm glad at least
one of us got the part.

11:29.438 --> 11:31.148
Milhouse!

11:31.232 --> 11:33.109
I didn't do it.
I wished him well.

11:33.192 --> 11:34.694
I wished him well!

11:34.777 --> 11:36.570
(screams)

11:36.654 --> 11:39.156
The stupid dummy wasn't
supposed to explode yet.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.199
(sighing)

11:40.282 --> 11:42.368
There's the real Milhouse.

11:42.451 --> 11:44.120
(tires screeching)

11:44.203 --> 11:46.038
(gasping)
Milhouse!

11:46.122 --> 11:48.207
Hey! You're not Milhouse.

11:48.290 --> 11:50.334
No, I'm just Milhouse
when he gets hurt.

11:50.418 --> 11:51.752
(groans)

11:51.836 --> 11:53.713
Okay, let's get
the real Milhouse over here

11:53.796 --> 11:55.506
under the X-ray truck.

11:59.009 --> 12:00.469
Hi, Bart.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.595
Hey, cool, Milhouse.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.431
You get to be crushed
by a truck.

12:03.514 --> 12:06.434
It sounds like more fun
than it really is.

12:06.517 --> 12:09.478
Hey! I think I'm lying
on a broken bottle.

12:09.562 --> 12:10.855
Beautiful! Use it.

12:10.938 --> 12:13.858
Okay, Fallout Boy
origin scene-- Take one.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.276
Action!

12:15.359 --> 12:16.819
(sizzling)

12:16.902 --> 12:17.820
(grunting)

12:17.903 --> 12:19.238
Up and at them.

12:19.321 --> 12:21.949
Thanks for the help,
mysterious stranger.

12:22.032 --> 12:25.786
Say, I think those X-rays
gave me super powers.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.997
DIRECTOR: And, cut!

12:28.080 --> 12:29.832
That was perfect.
Let's do it again.

12:29.915 --> 12:33.002
Uh, these aren't
real x-rays, are they?

12:33.085 --> 12:35.212
Good question!
We'll check into that.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.089
Okay, X-ray machine
to full power

12:37.173 --> 12:38.632
and... Action!

12:38.716 --> 12:40.926
(sizzling)

12:43.262 --> 12:46.056
Uh, sir, why don't you
just use real cows?

12:46.140 --> 12:47.683
Cows don't look
like cows on film.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.518
You got to use
horses.

12:49.602 --> 12:50.603
What do you do
if you want something

12:50.686 --> 12:53.189
that looks
like a horse?

12:53.272 --> 12:55.274
Usually we just tape a
bunch of cats together.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.609
You guys work
on the movie?

12:56.692 --> 12:58.110
You saying
we're not working?

12:58.194 --> 13:00.654
Oh, I always wanted
to be a teamster.

13:00.738 --> 13:02.740
So lazy and surly.

13:02.823 --> 13:05.034
Mind if I relax
next to you?

13:05.117 --> 13:07.286
(yawning)

13:07.369 --> 13:11.248
(yawning)

13:26.555 --> 13:29.141
Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

13:29.225 --> 13:30.226
Oh, here he comes.

13:30.309 --> 13:31.769
What is it now,
Quimby?

13:31.852 --> 13:34.772
Nothing, nothing, only
the city has just passed

13:34.855 --> 13:37.817
another tax
on puffy directing pants.

13:37.900 --> 13:40.069
But I don't wear
puffy pants.

13:40.152 --> 13:43.280
I meant a tax on
not wearing puffy pants.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.282
-Oy!
-I'm sorry.

13:49.745 --> 13:52.623
Wow! You really got it
made now, Milhouse.

13:52.706 --> 13:54.124
This is living.

13:54.208 --> 13:55.417
Is it, Bart?

13:55.501 --> 13:57.419
Is it really?

13:57.503 --> 13:58.671
Yeah.

13:58.754 --> 14:00.631
Ever since I became
a movie star

14:00.714 --> 14:02.174
I've been miserable.

14:02.258 --> 14:04.593
I had to get up
at 5:00 a.m. just for makeup.

14:04.677 --> 14:07.555
I like the way the blush
brings out my cheekbones

14:07.638 --> 14:09.139
but it's not worth it.

14:09.223 --> 14:11.934
And making movies
is so horribly repetitive.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.686
I've said "Jiminy jillikers"
so many times

14:13.769 --> 14:15.604
the words have lost
all meaning.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.440
We've got to do the "Jiminy jillikers"
scene again, Milhouse.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.526
(growling)
But we already did it.

14:20.609 --> 14:23.404
It took seven hours,
but we did it.

14:23.487 --> 14:25.489
It's done.

14:25.573 --> 14:28.576
Yes, but we've got to do it
from different angles

14:28.659 --> 14:30.035
again and again

14:30.119 --> 14:32.162
and again
and again and again.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.747
(screaming)

14:35.958 --> 14:37.001
Yeah...

14:37.084 --> 14:39.086
(sighing)

14:42.298 --> 14:45.759
I can't believe Silly Sailor
beat us both up

14:45.843 --> 14:49.722
and imprisoned us
in his floating aqua world.

14:49.805 --> 14:51.181
Jiminy jillikers!

14:51.265 --> 14:52.766
Tut-tut, now.

14:52.850 --> 14:56.061
There's no need
for profanity, Fallout Boy.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.980
Everyone in town has been
gouging us silly

14:58.063 --> 14:59.523
but it's worth it.

14:59.607 --> 15:01.442
It's all up there
on the screen.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.944
Yes. That Milhouse
is going to be big.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.529
Gabby Hayes big!

15:07.740 --> 15:09.909
Okay, listen up, everybody.

15:09.992 --> 15:11.994
This is the hardest,
most expensive scene in the movie,

15:12.077 --> 15:15.372
and we only get one shot at it,
so we have to do it right.

15:15.456 --> 15:18.167
Fallout Boy will untie
Radioactive Man

15:18.250 --> 15:21.128
and pull him to safety
moments before he's hit

15:21.211 --> 15:24.048
with a 40-foot wall
of sulfuric acid

15:24.131 --> 15:27.051
that will horribly burn
everything in it's path.

15:27.134 --> 15:30.387
Now, that's real acid, so
I want to see goggles, people.

15:31.722 --> 15:33.098
Real acid?

15:33.182 --> 15:36.226
Okay, roll film...

15:36.310 --> 15:38.020
tip the acid vats...

15:38.103 --> 15:40.064
and action!

15:41.190 --> 15:44.318
(grunting)

15:44.401 --> 15:47.529
Only Fallout Boy
can save me now.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.824
Where's Fallout Boy?

15:50.908 --> 15:51.909
(gasps)

15:54.328 --> 15:55.913
Fallout Boy!

15:55.996 --> 15:57.331
Uh-oh.

16:02.544 --> 16:04.546
My eyes!

16:04.630 --> 16:06.465
The goggles do nothing!

16:06.548 --> 16:08.092
(crashing)

16:09.468 --> 16:12.262
Ah, ooh! Ah!

16:17.267 --> 16:19.478
Where in the hell is Milhouse?

16:19.561 --> 16:22.773
That one shot cost us
a million dollars.

16:22.856 --> 16:24.692
KRUSTY:
Where's the producer?

16:24.775 --> 16:27.361
I want to talk
about this coffee.

16:46.046 --> 16:46.964
Milhouse!

16:47.047 --> 16:48.298
Milhouse!

16:48.382 --> 16:49.466
-Milhouse!
-Milhouse!

16:49.550 --> 16:51.593
Milhouse!

16:53.053 --> 16:55.472
Thanks to modern
editing techniques,

16:55.556 --> 16:57.891
we can use existing footage
to complete the film

16:57.975 --> 16:58.851
without Milhouse.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.520
Watch.

17:04.648 --> 17:07.568
It looks like we're
in trouble, Fallout Boy.

17:07.651 --> 17:10.279
Jiminy jillikers,
Radioactive Man.

17:10.362 --> 17:12.114
We'll have to
fight our way out.

17:12.197 --> 17:13.157
Are you ready?

17:13.240 --> 17:14.658
Yes.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.326
(grunting and groaning)

17:17.453 --> 17:18.829
Seamless, huh?

17:20.414 --> 17:22.332
-You're fired.
-And with good cause.

17:22.416 --> 17:23.542
(sniffing)

17:23.625 --> 17:24.585
(growling)

17:24.668 --> 17:25.586
Go!

17:27.629 --> 17:29.131
Okay. We can all
stop worrying now.

17:29.214 --> 17:30.507
These dogs never fail.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.968
But... will they
just find Milhouse

17:33.052 --> 17:34.887
or will they find him
and kill him?

17:34.970 --> 17:38.348
Well, they'll-- When they
find him, they'll, um...

17:38.432 --> 17:40.642
(mumbling)

17:41.894 --> 17:43.395
Uh, excuse me.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.147
You didn't answer me.
You just trailed off.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.191
Yeah.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.109
Yeah, I did kind of
trail off there, didn't I?

17:50.235 --> 17:51.570
I know Milhouse.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.572
I'll just check
all his old haunts.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.036
Have you seen Milhouse?

17:59.119 --> 18:00.120
No. Now, go away.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.205
We're racing
for the title

18:01.288 --> 18:02.164
of the champion
of the universe.

18:05.501 --> 18:06.460
All right.

18:12.508 --> 18:15.344
Yo, Dr. S., have
you seen Milhouse today?

18:15.427 --> 18:16.345
No.

18:16.428 --> 18:17.346
Okay. Thanks.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.722
Wait. Did you know

18:18.806 --> 18:20.015
that there's a
direct correlation

18:20.099 --> 18:21.225
between the decline
of Spirograph

18:21.308 --> 18:22.518
and the rise in
gang activity?

18:22.601 --> 18:23.644
-Think about it.
-I will.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.437
No, you won't.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.401
The only place left
is the tree house.

18:35.656 --> 18:36.698
Aha!

18:36.782 --> 18:38.367
Stay away from me, Bart.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.035
I mean it.
I'm not going back.

18:40.119 --> 18:42.079
I'm not cut out
to be a star.

18:42.162 --> 18:44.206
But, Milhouse,
being a star

18:44.289 --> 18:46.208
is every patriotic
American's dream.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.251
Not mine.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.836
It's a sham, Bart.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.672
You get up on that movie screen
pretending to be a hero

18:51.755 --> 18:53.590
but you're not.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.718
The real heroes are out there,
toiling day and night

18:56.802 --> 18:58.345
on more important things.

18:58.428 --> 19:00.013
Television.

19:00.097 --> 19:03.100
No. Curing heart disease
and wiping out world hunger.

19:03.183 --> 19:06.353
But, Milhouse, they
haven't cured anything.

19:06.436 --> 19:08.564
Heart disease and world hunger
are still rampant.

19:08.647 --> 19:11.525
Those do-gooders are all
a bunch of pitiful losers,

19:11.608 --> 19:13.110
every last one of them.

19:13.193 --> 19:15.112
You want results,
you have to go

19:15.195 --> 19:17.364
to the Schwarzeneggers,
the Stallones,

19:17.447 --> 19:19.074
and to a lesser extent,
the Van Dammes.

19:23.579 --> 19:24.955
BOTH: Mickey Rooney!

19:25.038 --> 19:26.582
Hi, Milhouse.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.083
The studio sent me
to talk to you

19:28.167 --> 19:30.252
being a former child star myself

19:30.335 --> 19:32.796
and the number-one
box office draw

19:32.880 --> 19:35.507
from 1939 through 1940.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.593
Wow, spanning two decades.

19:37.676 --> 19:39.094
How'd you find us?

19:39.178 --> 19:41.680
They tapped your
tree house phone.

19:41.763 --> 19:44.349
(radio signal beeping)

19:44.433 --> 19:47.102
Milhouse, listen, you
can't quit this movie.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.645
I've seen your work.

19:48.729 --> 19:50.689
It's good,
very, very good.

19:50.772 --> 19:52.482
Van Johnson good.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.151
I know I'm good.

19:54.234 --> 19:56.069
Movie stardom
is just so hollow.

19:56.153 --> 19:57.821
Hollow?!

19:57.905 --> 20:00.449
The only thing in
show business that's hollow

20:00.532 --> 20:01.783
is the music industry.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.202
Come on, Milhouse.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.579
You have to do this,
if not for yourself

20:05.662 --> 20:07.414
then for the movie-going public

20:07.497 --> 20:09.208
and for the foreign markets

20:09.291 --> 20:11.877
that are more important
than ever nowadays,

20:11.960 --> 20:17.549
and finally,
for me, the Mickster.

20:17.633 --> 20:18.675
No.

20:18.759 --> 20:20.344
All right. I tried.

20:20.427 --> 20:21.595
Fortunately, we have

20:21.678 --> 20:23.847
a perfectly good
Fallout Boy right here.

20:25.599 --> 20:28.644
Jiminy jillikers.
Jiminy jillikers.

20:28.727 --> 20:29.811
Jiminy jillikers.

20:29.895 --> 20:31.897
We're shutting
down production.

20:31.980 --> 20:34.608
Yeah. Well, we only
have $1,000 left, anyway.

20:34.691 --> 20:36.443
Uh, there's a $1,000
leaving-town tax.

20:40.322 --> 20:41.740
MICKEY: Well, I hope
you're all satisfied.

20:41.823 --> 20:44.117
You bankrupted a bunch
of naive movie folks.

20:44.201 --> 20:47.579
Folks from Hollywood,
where values are different.

20:47.663 --> 20:49.665
They weren't thinking
about the money.

20:49.748 --> 20:51.875
They just wanted
to tell a story,

20:51.959 --> 20:53.961
a story about
a radioactive man

20:54.044 --> 20:55.671
and you slick small-towners

20:55.754 --> 20:57.464
took them for all
they were worth.

20:57.547 --> 21:00.968
(whimpers)

21:01.051 --> 21:02.844
Should we give them
some of their money back?

21:03.720 --> 21:04.638
No.

21:06.807 --> 21:08.183
Hurry, Mr. Rooney.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.184
We've got
a disenchanted little girl

21:09.268 --> 21:10.644
in a Jell-O pudding commercial.

21:10.727 --> 21:11.937
I could play that.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.400
So, Milhouse, it
must be a little tough

21:16.483 --> 21:17.693
giving up all
that glamour

21:17.776 --> 21:19.027
and coming back
to school, huh?

21:19.111 --> 21:21.947
Quiet. Maybe I
can get my citizenship.

21:24.366 --> 21:26.201
(cheering)

21:28.120 --> 21:30.038
We know you don't have
any more money left

21:30.122 --> 21:31.581
but that doesn't matter.

21:31.665 --> 21:34.001
Just take whatever you need
from our boutiques

21:34.084 --> 21:35.961
until you can get back
on your feet.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.046
Thank God we're back
in Hollywood

21:38.130 --> 21:40.465
where people treat
each other right.
