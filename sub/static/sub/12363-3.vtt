00:22.956 --> 00:25.724
All right, how about a hand
for Branch Connally?

00:25.726 --> 00:29.161
we wish him better luck
in the election.

00:29.163 --> 00:30.863
You're the man,
Branch.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.334
Thought you had him.
I did.

00:35.336 --> 00:37.536
Let him win, Ferg.

00:37.538 --> 00:41.073
Quick photo.
Come on, guys.

00:53.921 --> 00:57.656
Ruby tell you where I was?
Yes.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.225
And she also wanted you to know
that the city council called.

01:00.227 --> 01:03.495
They have scheduled a debate
between you and Branch.

01:03.497 --> 01:06.265
I don't remember a debate
last election.

01:06.267 --> 01:07.699
That is because
you ran unopposed.

01:07.701 --> 01:11.537
what?

01:11.539 --> 01:13.872
I can tell you got
something else you want to say.

01:13.874 --> 01:16.775
Only after
you put down the ax.

01:20.914 --> 01:24.516
I heard from cady.

01:28.354 --> 01:30.189
She called you?

01:30.191 --> 01:31.623
She sent me an e-mail.

01:31.625 --> 01:35.027
It did not say much,
only that she is safe.

01:35.029 --> 01:37.863
This, uh, e-mail say where
she was or anything or...?

01:37.865 --> 01:40.632
If cady had wanted me to know,
she would have said so.

01:40.634 --> 01:42.868
she is an adult, walt.

01:42.870 --> 01:44.536
She's my daughter.

01:44.538 --> 01:47.139
Walt,
I am only the messenger.

01:51.411 --> 01:53.412
Hello?

01:53.414 --> 01:54.880
Miss etta place.

01:54.882 --> 01:58.383
Detective fales.
I was hoping to hear from you.

01:58.385 --> 02:00.219
What's with
the assumed name?

02:00.221 --> 02:02.654
I like my privacy.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.289
I'm calling to talk you
out of doing this.

02:04.291 --> 02:05.924
No, I need to
talk to someone

02:05.926 --> 02:07.926
Who will tell me
what happened to my mother.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.761
How long
are you in denver?

02:09.763 --> 02:13.232
As long as I have to be.

02:19.105 --> 02:21.306
The 911 operator said

02:21.308 --> 02:24.076
The call came from
somewhere near here.

02:24.078 --> 02:26.245
Blood.

02:26.247 --> 02:30.315
Sheriff's department.
Hello?

02:30.317 --> 02:32.951
Up here. Hello?

02:32.953 --> 02:36.054
Ohh, thank god.

02:38.258 --> 02:40.359
What's your name, son?

02:40.361 --> 02:43.428
I'm robbie colfer. It's my leg.
I think it's broken.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.632
It's not broken.
Kneecap's dislocated.

02:46.634 --> 02:49.034
That's impressive.
How did you manage that?

02:49.036 --> 02:52.271
I, uh, was riding my bike
up on state park trail.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.805
I guess I got lost.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.208
I didn't think state park
was anywhere near here.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.677
It isn't.
Try again, robbie.

03:02.215 --> 03:06.552
All right,
I know I'm on private property.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.288
But these hills are legendary,
man. I was stoked.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.989
Then I hit a rock,

03:10.991 --> 03:12.658
And next thing you know it,
tail up down the mountain.

03:12.660 --> 03:14.526
he's ass over heels.

03:14.528 --> 03:15.894
I got to see that again.
I'm sorry.

03:15.896 --> 03:20.365
Worse news... fine for
trespassing's $500, son.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.334
What? You got to be shitting...

03:26.173 --> 03:28.040
That's not cool, man.

03:28.042 --> 03:30.242
It'll be tender for a bit,
but you can walk on it.

03:30.244 --> 03:33.545
Hey, walt.
Robbie didn't hit a rock.

03:45.491 --> 03:48.160
No heartbeat.

03:51.664 --> 03:57.736
There's no head trauma.
No blood.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.539
He has no visible wounds.
He looks pretty young.

04:00.541 --> 04:05.611
Marko vayas.
32 years old.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.613
If I had to guess,

04:07.615 --> 04:11.283
I'd say heart attack
or aneurysm?

04:11.285 --> 04:14.453
What's with the beret?
"vayas" isn't french.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.887
Basque... immigrants from

04:16.890 --> 04:20.392
The mountains between
France and Spain.

04:20.394 --> 04:23.095
What are they doing
in wyoming?

04:23.097 --> 04:24.930
Uh, things got bad
in their homeland

04:24.932 --> 04:26.365
Around world war ii,

04:26.367 --> 04:29.301
So they came here
to raise sheep.

04:29.303 --> 04:32.638
I don't see any sheep.

04:34.741 --> 04:37.643
And I don't see his dog.

04:44.817 --> 04:46.818
Young guy dying
of a heart attack, okay,

04:46.820 --> 04:49.454
But his dog dying
at the same time's

04:49.456 --> 04:51.056
A little too coincidental.

04:51.058 --> 04:53.325
What do you think...
poison?

04:53.327 --> 04:54.559
Stop at his house.

04:54.561 --> 04:55.894
If there's poison there,

04:55.896 --> 04:57.829
We don't want
anyone else exposed.

04:57.831 --> 05:02.534
Robbie,
got to make a stop.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.114
Anyone home?

05:16.116 --> 05:18.383
Hello?

05:20.687 --> 05:23.121
Reclusive-bachelor chic.

05:23.123 --> 05:26.024
You and Marko
have the same decorator.

05:27.627 --> 05:30.329
I'll look for poison.

05:49.215 --> 05:51.950
There's no medications
in the cabinet, no food.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.952
This guy
obviously lived alone.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.954
It's kind of sad,
actually.

06:01.794 --> 06:04.796
He might have some family.
We should try to notify them.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.032
Any idea
how to find them?

06:08.735 --> 06:10.502
What's the date today?

06:31.090 --> 06:34.092
Barrabilak, please.

06:34.094 --> 06:35.727
Vic:

06:35.729 --> 06:39.364
Have you ever
had that before?

06:39.366 --> 06:40.766
Here you go.

06:45.705 --> 06:47.606
Thanks.

06:51.244 --> 06:53.745
What did you just eat?

06:55.281 --> 06:56.915
You don't want to know.

06:56.917 --> 07:01.420
Um...You know where we can find
the vayas family?

07:05.359 --> 07:08.226
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

07:08.228 --> 07:11.062
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

07:11.064 --> 07:15.600
hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!

07:15.602 --> 07:19.104
hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

07:35.121 --> 07:37.556
Costa, sal?
Is everything all right?

07:37.558 --> 07:40.459
This is my wife, amaya.
Pleasure.

07:40.461 --> 07:43.328
Sheriff longmire.
W- would you join us?

07:46.933 --> 07:48.767
Uh...

07:48.769 --> 07:52.737
I understand
you're related to Marko vayas.

07:52.739 --> 07:55.440
Mm-hmm.
Marko is our baby brother.

07:55.442 --> 07:56.908
He's not here, though.

07:56.910 --> 07:58.310
He went up into the pasture
three days ago

07:58.312 --> 07:59.778
So we could
compete in the festival.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.414
Have you seen
or talked to him since?

08:02.416 --> 08:03.815
What is this about?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.650
Sorry to tell you,

08:05.652 --> 08:08.086
We found your brother dead
this morning

08:08.088 --> 08:11.490
On his property
near gallitan falls.

08:11.492 --> 08:13.158
Are you sure of this?

08:13.160 --> 08:15.293
I'm afraid so.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.829
What happened?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.531
We're still trying to
figure that out.

08:19.533 --> 08:22.234
Ah.

08:28.342 --> 08:31.343
<i>Can you tell us
anything?</i>

08:31.345 --> 08:33.544
Was it an accident?

08:33.547 --> 08:35.947
Did he die of a heart attack
or something?

08:35.948 --> 08:38.549
Did Marko suffer from
any heart conditions?

08:38.552 --> 08:41.453
No, not that we know of,
but it runs in the family.

08:41.455 --> 08:45.390
Their father died a-a few months
ago from a heart attack.

08:49.161 --> 08:52.397
We found this picture
at his house.

08:52.399 --> 08:55.634
Is that his wife
or girlfriend or...

08:55.636 --> 08:58.036
She's a girl in ecuador.
Marko never met her.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.404
He had it in his head

08:59.406 --> 09:01.873
He was going to bring her
to wyoming to marry.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.309
Like a mail-order bride?

09:04.311 --> 09:07.512
We always call Marko "basati."
it means "crazy boy."

09:07.514 --> 09:10.382
He had these wild ideas
a lot,

09:10.384 --> 09:11.816
But he never
went through with the marriage.

09:11.818 --> 09:14.319
We were able to
talk some sense into him.

09:14.321 --> 09:18.990
Guess he just
held onto the picture.

09:22.029 --> 09:25.997
I'm sorry,
but we're not done yet.

09:25.999 --> 09:28.934
No one's
watching the sheep.

09:28.936 --> 09:30.936
Vic.

09:30.938 --> 09:33.405
Let him go.

09:33.407 --> 09:36.608
That was weird...
sal just leaving like that.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.677
I got four brothers,
and we don't always get along.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.345
But if you told me
one of them was dead,

09:40.347 --> 09:42.814
I wouldn't give a damn
about any sheep.

09:45.284 --> 09:48.453
What you thinking?

09:48.455 --> 09:50.288
I can't tell if Marko's family
is lying to us

09:50.290 --> 09:52.591
Or if Marko
was lying to his family.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.626
What makes you
say that?

09:54.628 --> 09:57.262
This picture
was taken here.

09:57.264 --> 09:59.297
This girl's in wyoming.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.441
What's that?

10:09.443 --> 10:12.644
Uh, this picture that walt found
at the victim's house.

10:12.646 --> 10:14.646
Something about it told him
it was taken from around here.

10:14.648 --> 10:17.248
She's cute.
Got a nice smile.

10:18.585 --> 10:19.985
More than I can say
for some people.

10:23.122 --> 10:25.824
Try cracking a grin
next time.

10:29.996 --> 10:32.063
Ohh.

10:32.065 --> 10:33.465
National crime
information center.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.966
This is david mackey.

10:34.968 --> 10:38.169
David, this is sheriff longmire,
absaroka county.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.472
I need you to run a name
through the computer for me...

10:40.474 --> 10:41.906
Marko vayas.

10:41.908 --> 10:44.909
I'm curious if any other
law-enforcement agency's

10:44.911 --> 10:46.745
Ever run his name
for anything.

10:46.747 --> 10:48.580
Sure,
I'll check the database.

10:48.582 --> 10:50.982
Now, listen...
while I got you on the phone,

10:50.984 --> 10:52.417
Uh, has there been any hit

10:52.419 --> 10:54.619
On that name
I gave you a while back?

10:54.621 --> 10:56.321
Sheriff,
I told you before,

10:56.323 --> 10:59.190
If anyone looks into
this henry "standing bear" guy,

10:59.192 --> 11:00.425
I'll call you.

11:00.427 --> 11:03.094
I appreciate it.

11:05.364 --> 11:07.032
I got it.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.834
It's the mountain.
Nope. It's the bird.

11:09.836 --> 11:12.604
A red-tip meadowlark.
Yeah.

11:12.606 --> 11:14.039
Wyoming native.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.675
Don't go much further south
than the bighorns.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.309
Come out to the pasture
this time of year

11:18.311 --> 11:20.512
To eat the clover that grows
in the sheep droppings.

11:20.514 --> 11:23.715
So, the picture could have been
taken on Marko's land.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.718
You get anything
from the biker's video?

11:26.720 --> 11:28.319
Uh, no.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.555
Besides the crash,
there's really nothing to see.

11:30.557 --> 11:32.991
It's about two hours long.
I watched it in fast forward.

11:32.993 --> 11:35.326
You go too fast,
you miss the little things.

11:35.328 --> 11:37.962
Slow it down, watch it again.
We're not gonna get

11:37.964 --> 11:39.798
Marko's toxicology report back
for a few weeks,

11:39.800 --> 11:41.299
And I have spent
the last two hours

11:41.301 --> 11:43.034
Going through 100
mail-order-bride websites.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.236
Hey, walt?

11:45.238 --> 11:47.672
Why does she get
all the good assignments?

11:47.674 --> 11:49.307
We need to get ahold
of Marko's computer

11:49.309 --> 11:51.409
If we're ever gonna figure out
which services he used.

11:51.411 --> 11:54.813
Marko didn't have
a computer.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.414
Where'd he find the girl,
then?

12:00.052 --> 12:05.090
the old-fashioned way.

12:09.562 --> 12:14.399
"cyrano caballero...
big sky matchmaker.

12:14.401 --> 12:16.067
Say hola
to your new bride."

12:16.069 --> 12:17.869
Hmm.

12:17.871 --> 12:22.006
You know the number-one epidemic
facing american men today

12:22.008 --> 12:23.441
Is heartache.

12:23.443 --> 12:26.077
What you got is a lot of
very frustrated fellas

12:26.079 --> 12:28.580
Looking for
a better class of woman.

12:28.582 --> 12:31.416
Luckily, though, right on
the other side of that border,

12:31.418 --> 12:33.618
You've got plenty of
lovely latin ladies

12:33.620 --> 12:36.788
Who are also looking
to improve their lives.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.857
So I put
these two together,

12:38.859 --> 12:41.392
And bingo...
problemo solved.

12:41.394 --> 12:43.461
A cure, if you will.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.797
I can't believe men actually
pay you for this stuff.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.232
A lot of guys
actually think

12:47.234 --> 12:50.869
American women
are pushy and overbearing.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.370
Sheriff,
I couldn't help but notice

12:52.372 --> 12:54.639
That you don't have a ring
on that finger.

12:54.641 --> 12:57.242
You know, I'd be more than happy
to offer you my services.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.144
No. No, thank you.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.945
A good woman
goes a long way

13:00.947 --> 13:03.882
To easing some of the obvious
stresses of your daily life.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.084
I'm seeing someone.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.720
We're not here to talk
about his love life, okay?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.657
Do you recognize
this girl?

13:12.659 --> 13:15.260
Oh, yeah.
That's Rosa Marquez.

13:15.262 --> 13:18.797
And a true Rose she is.

13:18.799 --> 13:22.801
Married a basquo boy
by the name of Marko vayas.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.303
Couldn't have been
more than a month ago.

13:25.305 --> 13:26.938
Yeah,
we spoke to Marko's family.

13:26.940 --> 13:28.239
They had the impression

13:28.241 --> 13:30.341
He didn't go through
with the marriage.

13:30.343 --> 13:33.578
A lot of times, families have
a hard time understanding love.

13:33.580 --> 13:37.415
But I can assure you
they were married.

13:37.417 --> 13:40.018
I helped her put
her immigration papers in order

13:40.020 --> 13:42.287
And I officiated
the ceremony.

13:42.289 --> 13:43.755
Good. Then you'll have
her immigration papers

13:43.757 --> 13:45.957
And her
last known address.

13:45.959 --> 13:50.328
Mm, my stuff's
not all that computerized.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.797
Besides, I can't just
give you my client's personal information.

13:52.799 --> 13:57.001
Marko vayas was found dead,
possibly murdered, and Rosa...

13:57.003 --> 13:59.537
There was no sign of her
at his house.

13:59.539 --> 14:02.173
Oh, hold on here.
If you think that Rosa

14:02.175 --> 14:03.608
Had anything to do
with Marko's death,

14:03.610 --> 14:05.376
You got
another thing coming.

14:05.378 --> 14:08.379
I put all my girls through
a rigorous background check,

14:08.381 --> 14:11.216
And I'll tell you that Rosa
is as good a girl as they come.

14:11.218 --> 14:14.219
Jeremiah, I'm not
accusing Rosa of anything,

14:14.221 --> 14:16.154
But I do need to
talk to her.

14:16.156 --> 14:17.789
I mean,
I'm sorry about Marko.

14:17.791 --> 14:22.627
My heart goes out to his family
and to Rosa.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.028
But I'll tell you what,

14:24.030 --> 14:25.864
I haven't spoke
to either one of them

14:25.866 --> 14:27.532
Since the day
they got hitched.

14:30.703 --> 14:33.538
All right. You hear from Rosa,
give us a call.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.540
I certainly will,
but I can assure you

14:35.542 --> 14:38.476
You won't find that she had
anything to do with any of this.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.345
Oh, sheriff.

14:40.347 --> 14:43.047
If things don't work out
with your lady friend,

14:43.049 --> 14:44.749
Here's my card.

14:44.751 --> 14:48.720
Give me a call if and when
you change your mind, all right?

14:54.895 --> 14:57.896
I, uh, got the preliminary
autopsy report.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.564
Marko didn't die from
an aneurysm or a heart attack.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.000
It was respiratory failure
caused by,

15:02.002 --> 15:04.836
And I quote, "exposure to
an unknown substance."

15:04.838 --> 15:06.404
Poison.

15:06.406 --> 15:09.274
- Where are we with Rosa Marquez?
- Stuck.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.842
Immigrations and customs

15:10.844 --> 15:12.510
Said they'd get back to me
on Rosa's visa info,

15:12.512 --> 15:14.779
But who knows
how long that'll take, so...

15:16.415 --> 15:20.418
Lizzie brought that by
for you.

15:21.954 --> 15:24.122
So...

15:24.124 --> 15:25.690
What?

15:25.692 --> 15:27.058
Uh...
I found something.

15:27.060 --> 15:29.861
oh, sorry.

15:29.863 --> 15:32.630
Was I interrupting?
No, that's my phone. I think.

15:32.632 --> 15:36.701
Uh, before I show you the video,
I just...

15:36.703 --> 15:38.803
I just
wanted to say that,

15:38.805 --> 15:40.805
About the picture
in the paper...

15:40.807 --> 15:44.409
I wasn't there
supporting Branch.

15:44.411 --> 15:47.412
We were on patrol. He said
he just needed to make a stop.

15:47.414 --> 15:50.148
- I didn't know it was gonna be
for the campaign... - Ferg.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.716
What did you find
on the video?

15:57.623 --> 15:59.624
You see that?

15:59.626 --> 16:02.660
The biker had a bottle of water
with him.

16:02.662 --> 16:04.595
And?

16:04.597 --> 16:06.431
Well, if Marko was
in those hills for a while,

16:06.433 --> 16:08.066
He would have
had drinking water, too.

16:08.068 --> 16:11.436
Hot day and all.
But you didn't find any.

16:11.438 --> 16:15.073
Someone must have
poisoned his canteen

16:15.075 --> 16:17.542
And took it
before you got there.

16:21.013 --> 16:22.847
Okay.

16:22.849 --> 16:26.284
See if you can find
that canteen.

16:26.286 --> 16:29.487
That was immigration.
I underestimated them.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.922
As far as they know,

16:30.924 --> 16:33.124
Rosa hasn't left the country,
but get this.

16:33.126 --> 16:37.328
The address on her visa...
it's not Marko's place.

16:40.699 --> 16:43.034
First mexican drug dealers,
now mail-order brides.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.469
That's
quite the clientele.

16:44.471 --> 16:47.171
I don't judge people.
Warrant.

16:51.143 --> 16:55.146
Sheriff's department.

17:03.889 --> 17:05.890
Something tells me
they're not yours.

17:05.892 --> 17:08.126
Hey!

17:08.127 --> 17:11.061
Rosa just
jumped out the window.

17:15.334 --> 17:18.970
Stop right there!

17:24.009 --> 17:25.843
Look, hear... hear me out, walt.
I- I know how this looks.

17:25.845 --> 17:28.413
But the innocent party here
is Rosa.

17:28.415 --> 17:30.748
Most innocent people don't
jump out the window and run.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.184
She's afraid
she's being deported.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.319
Thinks 'cause
her husband up and died,

17:35.321 --> 17:36.988
She's not a citizen
anymore.

17:36.990 --> 17:39.824
Told her it ain't so,
but she won't listen to me.

17:39.826 --> 17:42.026
Sheriff, I didn't mean to interfere
with your investigation,

17:42.028 --> 17:44.228
But somebody's got to
look out for this girl here.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.999
You seem to care an awful lot
about Rosa.

17:48.001 --> 17:50.935
I care more
about my business.

17:50.937 --> 17:52.503
I guarantee all my girls

17:52.505 --> 17:54.505
They're gonna be safe
from police harassment.

17:54.507 --> 17:58.109
It helps if your girls
don't murder their husbands.

17:58.111 --> 18:01.546
I never kill Marko.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.581
He was a good man.

18:03.583 --> 18:08.252
He gave me a house,
new life.

18:08.254 --> 18:10.955
We searched Marko's house.
No one was living there but him.

18:10.957 --> 18:13.191
No.

18:13.193 --> 18:18.196
I visit once.
It...Was a beautiful land.

18:18.198 --> 18:23.034
But...Marko was scared
of what his brothers say,

18:23.036 --> 18:26.037
So we decide
I could go live at the hotel,

18:26.039 --> 18:28.639
And when Marko
sell his land,

18:28.641 --> 18:32.877
We could get
a new house together.

18:32.879 --> 18:35.279
Marko was selling his land.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.482
You didn't think
to mention that?

18:37.484 --> 18:39.584
I thought about it.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.985
Who was
he selling it to?

18:40.987 --> 18:43.387
No idea.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.958
I think they conned him.

18:46.960 --> 18:49.794
Jeremiah convinces Marko to sell
his land to get the girl,

18:49.796 --> 18:51.929
They kill Marko,
Rosa inherits,

18:51.931 --> 18:54.132
She and jeremiah
split the profits.

18:54.134 --> 18:56.000
Need to confirm that Marko
was selling his land first.

18:56.002 --> 18:58.436
Well, I'll head over
to the county clerk's office,

18:58.438 --> 19:00.738
See if anyone was
pulling permits on the land.

19:00.740 --> 19:03.608
Any luck with the canteen?

19:03.610 --> 19:05.276
No,
but I'll keep looking.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.912
Also, get some search warrants
for jeremiah's office,

19:07.914 --> 19:09.514
Rosa's hotel room.

19:09.516 --> 19:12.517
Look for
any types of poison.

19:12.519 --> 19:15.853
Meantime, I'd say
those two are a flight risk.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.755
Let's lock them up for a bit.
What about Marko's brothers?

19:17.757 --> 19:20.158
Rosa said
Marko was afraid of them.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.593
If he was selling the family
land and they found out,

19:22.595 --> 19:24.629
They'd have reason
to be pissed.

19:24.631 --> 19:27.131
Yeah.

19:27.133 --> 19:30.768
When your mother, uh,
left the hospital

19:30.770 --> 19:33.938
After her chemo treatment
around 8:00,

19:33.940 --> 19:35.940
She stopped into
this café.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.476
The waitress said
she ordered a cup of tea.

19:38.478 --> 19:41.646
About 30 minutes later,
she left,

19:41.648 --> 19:44.048
Heading back to the hotel.

19:46.119 --> 19:50.121
Her attacker came from
this alleyway.

19:50.123 --> 19:52.323
Somewhere in the scuffle,

19:52.325 --> 19:55.459
He stabbed her twice
and took off.

19:59.865 --> 20:02.300
Is this
where she died?

20:02.302 --> 20:05.803
No. She survived
the initial stabbing.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.406
She died
a few hours later.

20:08.408 --> 20:11.809
The hospital managed to
get ahold of your father.

20:11.811 --> 20:14.879
He was with her
when she passed.

20:20.419 --> 20:22.420
Did you ever
catch the guy?

20:22.422 --> 20:25.590
That's why I came
to absaroka last month.

20:25.592 --> 20:29.994
We did find him...Dead.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.900
I want to see his face.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.943
Easy. Come.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.578
He tends to get aggressive
around outsiders.

20:47.580 --> 20:50.681
Just stopped by
costa's house.

20:50.683 --> 20:53.884
Amaya told us
we could find you two up here.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.453
Is costa around?

20:55.455 --> 20:56.887
We need to
speak to both of you.

20:56.889 --> 20:59.090
According to this,

20:59.092 --> 21:04.295
Costa left a day ago
for the north pasture.

21:04.297 --> 21:06.130
That's six miles that way.

21:06.132 --> 21:08.766
What are
all those markings?

21:08.768 --> 21:12.737
70 years of my family's work
is written on this land.

21:12.739 --> 21:14.538
Any of this land
belong to Marko?

21:14.540 --> 21:15.940
When my father died,

21:15.942 --> 21:19.210
He divided the land
between the three of us,

21:19.212 --> 21:23.781
But we work it together...
Equally.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.784
We spoke to some people
said Marko was planning to sell.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.119
Those people lied.

21:28.121 --> 21:30.755
Oh, it's possible
he didn't tell you.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.757
Seem to be a few things
he's kept from you,

21:32.759 --> 21:35.293
Like the fact that he married
that girl from ecuador.

21:35.295 --> 21:36.894
It's strange
that he never mentioned that.

21:36.896 --> 21:40.231
Maybe he was afraid
of how you'd react.

21:40.233 --> 21:42.233
I told him
that was a mistake.

21:42.235 --> 21:45.236
Little basati was foolish
when it came to some things.

21:45.238 --> 21:46.737
But there are
certain things

21:46.739 --> 21:48.639
<i>Even he was not
foolish enough to do.</i>

21:48.641 --> 21:51.509
He would never sell this land
behind our backs.

21:51.511 --> 21:54.645
Too many have tried to steal it
in the past.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.280
Like who, exactly?

21:56.282 --> 21:58.482
Lumber companies.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.918
They cut down our trees
without permission,

22:00.920 --> 22:02.486
Drive their logging trucks
through our pastures.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.689
You asked before
about our enemies.

22:04.691 --> 22:07.992
Those people.
They are our enemies.

22:12.464 --> 22:14.598
Is that a spring?

22:14.600 --> 22:16.500
Our land is full of them.

22:16.502 --> 22:18.436
Freshest water
you'll ever...

22:18.438 --> 22:20.371
walt!

22:20.373 --> 22:22.973
Hang on! Hang on!
Hang on.

22:22.975 --> 22:24.275
Are there any springs
like this

22:24.277 --> 22:26.177
Near where we found
your brother?

22:28.480 --> 22:30.715
Show me.

22:30.717 --> 22:34.218
This weather is insane.

22:34.220 --> 22:36.654
We only went up,
like, 100 feet in elevation.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.889
It's wyoming.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.899
What are those?
Weeds?

22:48.901 --> 22:50.267
It's hemlock.

22:51.703 --> 22:53.404
Looks like
we found our poison.

23:10.021 --> 23:13.591
Hey. Check it out.

23:13.593 --> 23:16.660
It's our new
poker-chip design.

23:16.662 --> 23:18.562
Just came in today.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.500
It's nice.
Keep it.

23:22.502 --> 23:24.402
So, I've been seeing
your new television ads

23:24.404 --> 23:26.036
All over the place.

23:26.038 --> 23:27.271
Good to see you putting
the campaign funds to use.

23:27.273 --> 23:29.707
Trust you're getting
everything you need.

23:29.709 --> 23:32.910
Yes. Thank you.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.513
But I've actually come
about something else today.

23:35.515 --> 23:36.881
What's that?

23:36.883 --> 23:40.084
Big pines timber
recently pulled the permit

23:40.086 --> 23:43.087
On a piece of property
I was looking into.

23:43.089 --> 23:45.723
When I checked to see
who owned the company,

23:45.725 --> 23:48.392
I was surprised to see
your name on the board.

23:48.394 --> 23:50.394
Oh,
I assumed you knew.

23:50.396 --> 23:54.098
My boys at the lumber yard did
just throw you a campaign rally.

23:54.100 --> 23:57.735
I thought you were just
a casino developer.

23:57.737 --> 24:00.738
I had no idea
you were in the timber business.

24:00.740 --> 24:03.374
I prefer to remain
a silent partner.

24:03.376 --> 24:04.642
White people get nervous

24:04.644 --> 24:06.944
When indians
start taking back their land.

24:06.946 --> 24:10.381
Why were you looking
into the company?

24:10.383 --> 24:13.584
The land big pines timber
was looking to buy

24:13.586 --> 24:17.588
Belonged to a basque
sheep herder... Marko vayas.

24:17.590 --> 24:20.491
He was recently
found dead.

24:22.461 --> 24:26.297
Well,
that sounds tragic.

24:26.299 --> 24:31.068
I've heard Marko may have been
reconsidering the sale.

24:31.070 --> 24:34.138
How badly did your company
want that land?

24:37.976 --> 24:40.811
Are you accusing me
of something, Branch?

24:40.813 --> 24:43.013
Jacob, I'm sure
it's just a coincidence,

24:43.015 --> 24:47.017
But a dead body turning up
in the middle of a business deal

24:47.019 --> 24:48.953
Is bad p. R.

24:48.955 --> 24:50.421
I know
you don't need that,

24:50.423 --> 24:54.425
So I'm here to discuss it
with you privately.

24:54.427 --> 24:57.027
But if you don't
give me anything,

24:57.029 --> 25:01.499
Sooner or later,
walt will come knocking.

25:05.437 --> 25:07.271
Well, I can tell you
that our company

25:07.273 --> 25:09.273
Has wanted that parcel
for quite some time.

25:09.275 --> 25:11.775
Mr. Vayas rejected
our first two offers,

25:11.777 --> 25:14.512
But I thought we were finally
nearing a deal.

25:14.514 --> 25:19.783
So, his death now, in fact,
poses a problem for us.

25:22.654 --> 25:24.288
Thanks.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.523
You bet.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.191
What can you tell me
about the case?

25:27.193 --> 25:29.126
You got suspects,
witnesses?

25:29.128 --> 25:31.562
Do you know
who inherits Marko's land?

25:31.564 --> 25:34.565
I can't give you details
about an ongoing investigation.

25:34.567 --> 25:40.204
Branch...I didn't donate
$100,000 to your campaign

25:40.206 --> 25:42.573
Because
I like your smile.

25:45.644 --> 25:50.247
I was up at Marko's wells
looking for hemlock,

25:50.249 --> 25:53.651
And, uh, these are some of
the cuttings that I took.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.653
This is elderberry.

25:55.655 --> 25:57.588
It's almost identical
to hemlock

25:57.590 --> 25:59.823
Except for the berries,
obviously.

25:59.825 --> 26:02.026
Oh,
and it won't kill you.

26:02.028 --> 26:04.094
And how exactly
does that help us?

26:04.096 --> 26:06.397
Well, I didn't actually
find hemlock by the wells,

26:06.399 --> 26:08.032
But I just thought

26:08.034 --> 26:12.036
It might be useful to see
what it sort of looks like.

26:12.038 --> 26:15.239
You get anything from
jeremiah's house or the motel?

26:15.241 --> 26:18.275
No poison, no canteen.

26:18.277 --> 26:20.244
Jeremiah and Rosa
are still in jail.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.745
It's been
almost 24 hours.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.247
If we want to hold them,

26:23.249 --> 26:24.682
We're gonna have to
charge them with something.

26:24.684 --> 26:26.016
Jeremiah's lawyer's
already on his way here.

26:26.018 --> 26:29.219
All right.
Release them, Ferg.

26:29.221 --> 26:32.423
Before you do,
impound their cars

26:32.425 --> 26:34.925
And have Rosa
surrender her passport.

26:38.964 --> 26:40.598
What's all this?

26:40.600 --> 26:43.601
Turns out Marko was poisoned
by hemlock.

26:43.603 --> 26:45.035
He's probably the only person
that died from it

26:45.037 --> 26:47.638
Since socrates.

26:47.640 --> 26:48.973
All right, I googled it.

26:48.975 --> 26:52.109
Poison's nothing new.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.611
Back when the railroad
was coming through,

26:53.613 --> 26:57.047
The u. S. Army used to poison
indian wells on occasion

26:57.049 --> 27:00.317
To kill the natives
and take their land, so...

27:02.087 --> 27:03.721
But Marko's brothers
were the only ones

27:03.723 --> 27:05.322
Who knew
where that well was.

27:05.324 --> 27:06.790
Not the only ones.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.793
Rosa said she spent some time
on the property.

27:09.795 --> 27:12.429
Marko could have
showed her the well,

27:12.431 --> 27:15.065
Showing off the estate
to his bride-to-be,

27:15.067 --> 27:17.067
Or anyone looking
to buy the property

27:17.069 --> 27:19.903
Could have done some surveying,
found the well that way.

27:19.905 --> 27:22.406
You find anything
at the county clerk's office?

27:22.408 --> 27:23.974
Yeah.

27:23.976 --> 27:26.977
Big pines timber
was trying to buy Marko's land.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.813
Spoke with
an official from the company

27:29.815 --> 27:32.016
Who said Marko rejected
the first couple offers,

27:32.018 --> 27:34.351
But looks like they were
close to cutting a deal.

27:34.353 --> 27:35.686
Which official?

27:35.688 --> 27:38.522
Spoke on
the condition of anonymity.

27:38.524 --> 27:41.825
We're not reporters,
Branch.

27:45.865 --> 27:49.299
Big pines timber just called.
We got to get down there.

27:58.978 --> 28:01.178
You think
you can just kill us?

28:01.180 --> 28:02.479
You'll have to do better
than poison.

28:02.481 --> 28:06.450
We won't die so easily.

28:09.889 --> 28:13.390
Hey! Break it up!
Sal, get off!

28:13.392 --> 28:16.060
Break it up!

28:18.663 --> 28:20.798
Come on.

28:20.800 --> 28:25.803
Look.
They've already begun.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.205
They're wiping us out.

28:28.207 --> 28:31.041
You have to do something,
sheriff.

28:31.043 --> 28:33.444
Please.
Take him.

28:39.350 --> 28:43.654
Any truth
in what sal's saying?

28:43.656 --> 28:47.391
His brother came to us wanting
to sell his part of their land,

28:47.393 --> 28:48.759
But the company thought

28:48.761 --> 28:50.594
It would be better
to have the whole thing.

28:50.596 --> 28:54.498
We made the family an offer
for all three plots a week ago.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.900
It was
a very generous offer.

28:56.902 --> 28:59.803
A simple "no"
would have sufficed.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.746
Is this the knife
he used to kill her?

29:08.748 --> 29:11.915
Yeah,
we found it with his body.

29:11.917 --> 29:15.919
Her dna was on the blade.
I know it's tough.

29:15.921 --> 29:18.756
I'm only sorry you had to
get all this from me.

29:18.758 --> 29:21.391
I'm sure this would have been
easier coming from your father.

29:21.393 --> 29:24.027
Unfortunately, he didn't
leave us much of a choice.

29:24.029 --> 29:25.295
Well, it couldn't have been
easy for him

29:25.297 --> 29:26.864
Keeping something like this
from you.

29:26.866 --> 29:29.767
You'd be surprised.
He's gotten pretty good at it.

29:29.769 --> 29:31.969
Don't be so hard on him.

29:31.971 --> 29:34.705
I mean, everything
you're feeling right now,

29:34.707 --> 29:37.141
He's had to
go through it alone.

29:37.143 --> 29:38.642
I mean, besides you,

29:38.644 --> 29:40.878
He only has that friend of his
to talk to.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.647
Um...Uh...
Henry.

29:45.550 --> 29:48.218
Henry. That's right.

29:51.723 --> 29:54.124
Is this his body?

29:54.126 --> 29:56.260
- He didn't die of an overdose?
- No.

29:56.262 --> 29:57.895
Someone broke his neck.

29:57.897 --> 30:00.631
Do you have any idea
who killed him?

30:00.633 --> 30:02.266
None.

30:02.268 --> 30:05.002
But I've been at this
a long time.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.637
And sooner or later,

30:06.639 --> 30:10.340
Everyone tells their secrets
to somebody.

30:12.410 --> 30:15.646
Hey, uh,
I hope all this helped.

30:15.648 --> 30:18.849
It did, I think.

30:18.851 --> 30:21.752
You need anything else,
feel free to call me, okay?

30:21.754 --> 30:24.755
I don't think I'm gonna do that.
No offense.

30:24.757 --> 30:26.490
No offense taken.

30:32.530 --> 30:34.765
Who was that?

30:34.767 --> 30:36.133
She was either sent here

30:36.135 --> 30:38.335
By the prime suspect
in my murder case

30:38.337 --> 30:43.173
To find out what I know,
or she's my new best friend.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.878
That was costa.
Told him the situation.

30:47.880 --> 30:49.046
He said he'd get down here
as soon as he could.

30:49.048 --> 30:51.682
Why am I in this cell?
Why?!

30:51.684 --> 30:55.519
It's those timber people
that should be in here.

30:55.521 --> 30:58.956
There's no crime
trying to buy someone's land.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.959
We know big pines timber
made offers to all your family.

31:01.961 --> 31:05.863
That's a lie. No one came
to offer me anything.

31:05.865 --> 31:08.332
Everything they said so far
has been true.

31:08.334 --> 31:10.167
Whatever
that timber company offered,

31:10.169 --> 31:12.336
Looks like Marko
was gonna accept it.

31:12.338 --> 31:13.637
And you would have done
just about anything

31:13.639 --> 31:15.038
To stop that,
wouldn't you?

31:15.040 --> 31:16.840
That land's
been in your family

31:16.842 --> 31:18.175
For generations.

31:18.177 --> 31:20.477
Marko was about to
sell you all out.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.346
You know nothing.
Nothing!

31:25.351 --> 31:29.653
Settle down!

31:33.925 --> 31:39.429
You ever hear of guernica,
sheriff?

31:41.499 --> 31:43.500
Yeah.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.869
It's a basque
down in Spain.

31:45.871 --> 31:49.006
Hitler bombed it,

31:49.008 --> 31:52.009
Picasso made a painting
about it,

31:52.011 --> 31:55.412
And Marko had a copy of it
in his house.

31:57.515 --> 32:01.351
In 1937,

32:01.353 --> 32:07.224
Franco let hitler use us
for target practice.

32:07.226 --> 32:12.763
My grandparents were the only
ones of their family to survive.

32:12.765 --> 32:17.134
Their land was gone...
destroyed.

32:17.136 --> 32:21.772
But they had each other.

32:21.774 --> 32:26.677
If you think I care more
about land than my brother...

32:29.480 --> 32:31.381
...You're wrong.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.787
But if what you're saying
is true...

32:36.789 --> 32:43.293
If someone killed Marko
over a piece of pasture...

32:46.097 --> 32:49.299
<i>...You best pray you find them,
sheriff.</i>

32:49.301 --> 32:52.502
Because
if I get to them first,

32:52.504 --> 32:56.673
I will rip them apart
with my bare hands.

33:20.665 --> 33:24.267
Death came in
like thunder.

33:24.269 --> 33:26.536
Walt?

33:31.109 --> 33:33.310
If you're a man like sal

33:33.312 --> 33:36.780
And you wanted to
kill someone...

33:40.385 --> 33:43.086
...You do it face-to-face.

33:49.293 --> 33:51.695
You'd want to see him
up close...

33:51.697 --> 33:54.531
Watch the light
go out of their eyes,

33:54.533 --> 33:57.734
And you wouldn't care
if you got caught.

33:57.736 --> 34:00.370
Poison is
a coward's weapon.

34:00.372 --> 34:05.375
Killers that use it
are patient, sneaky.

34:05.377 --> 34:08.078
They want to
get away with it.

34:08.080 --> 34:10.514
Sal doesn't fit that bill.

34:10.516 --> 34:13.583
But there are
a few people that do.

34:13.585 --> 34:17.020
Branch, Ferg,
go find jeremiah and Rosa,

34:17.022 --> 34:18.422
Bring them back in.

34:18.424 --> 34:21.291
Vic, let's go see
costa and his wife.

34:27.665 --> 34:29.666
<i>Now what the hell
is it?</i>

34:29.668 --> 34:32.069
I just stopped by the motel.
Rosa's not there.

34:32.071 --> 34:34.237
I'm guessing
you know where she is.

34:34.239 --> 34:36.873
I don't know anything.

34:36.875 --> 34:38.007
Rosa?

34:40.945 --> 34:42.779
I don't see their truck.

34:42.781 --> 34:45.614
Maybe costa's on his way
to the station to pick up sal?

34:45.617 --> 34:48.851
Walt, it's Ferg.

34:48.853 --> 34:52.255
I got jeremiah in custody,
but it looks like Rosa bolted.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.192
All right,
bring jeremiah in.

34:55.194 --> 34:56.893
And, Branch,
keep looking for Rosa.

34:58.097 --> 35:00.530
Uh, I don't know
where Branch is.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.199
He didn't come with me.

35:04.769 --> 35:07.270
I need to
speak with Jacob.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.272
- He's out at a business dinner.
- Where?

35:09.274 --> 35:11.708
I know times,
I don't know places.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.276
But I'll tell him
you dropped by.

35:13.278 --> 35:15.278
No.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.614
I'll tell him myself.

35:24.123 --> 35:26.756
Costa?

35:26.758 --> 35:29.126
Sheriff longmire.

35:29.128 --> 35:31.294
What the hell
happened here?

35:31.296 --> 35:33.430
What did you say to costa
when you called?

35:33.432 --> 35:37.000
I just told him about sal
and the lumber company.

35:37.002 --> 35:38.368
There's nobody here.

35:41.439 --> 35:43.607
There's no telling
where they went.

35:45.010 --> 35:47.310
There's someone
who might know.

36:03.162 --> 36:04.995
This doesn't concern you,
sheriff!

36:04.997 --> 36:07.030
Pull her up!
Pull her up now!

36:07.032 --> 36:09.666
I just wanted her
to admit what she did.

36:11.270 --> 36:13.003
She sold us out!

36:15.440 --> 36:16.873
Oh, my god!
Amaya?

36:16.875 --> 36:20.477
Stay down!
He was trying to drown me!

36:20.479 --> 36:23.346
I wasn't
trying to kill her!

36:36.194 --> 36:38.261
Yes, you were.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.399
Holding a person's head
in a poisoned well...

36:42.401 --> 36:44.401
That's attempted murder
in my book.

36:44.403 --> 36:46.002
You poisoned this well?

36:46.004 --> 36:47.470
I didn't.
I had no idea.

36:47.472 --> 36:50.006
Then how did this
get here?

36:52.511 --> 36:54.544
- You swallow any of that water?
- Oh, god, I don't know.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.979
hemlock takes
about an hour

36:55.981 --> 36:57.914
To work its way
into your system.

36:57.916 --> 37:00.183
Ambulance may not
get here in time, but if we hurry...

37:00.185 --> 37:02.252
Please,
get me to a hospital.

37:02.254 --> 37:04.721
I will. I will.
Not just yet.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.923
- What?
- Walt, what the hell are you doing?

37:06.925 --> 37:09.426
Getting to
the bottom of this.

37:09.428 --> 37:12.862
I think
the person who killed Marko

37:12.864 --> 37:15.498
Knew that he was
trying to sell his land.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.334
Big pines timber said
you all knew.

37:17.336 --> 37:18.902
They said they made offers
to your whole family

37:18.904 --> 37:20.170
For the property.

37:20.172 --> 37:21.871
Sal said
he never got an offer.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.173
That true for you, costa?

37:23.175 --> 37:26.209
No. No!
I never spoke with anyone!

37:26.211 --> 37:28.411
That's right.

37:28.413 --> 37:31.248
You and sal
were always with the herd.

37:31.250 --> 37:33.283
Days at a time.

37:35.052 --> 37:39.055
Amaya...You were the only one
who was home

37:39.057 --> 37:44.194
When the lumber company came
to make an offer for your land.

37:44.196 --> 37:47.397
They told you that Marko
was planning to sell his land.

37:47.399 --> 37:50.800
You didn't tell your husband
and sal about the offer.

37:50.802 --> 37:53.637
You didn't tell them
what Marko was planning.

37:53.639 --> 37:56.106
You decided to handle
the situation yourself.

37:56.108 --> 37:57.540
I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:57.542 --> 37:59.542
You make it look like
a heart attack

37:59.544 --> 38:02.379
'cause you knew the boys' father
had died of one.

38:02.381 --> 38:05.582
Wouldn't look strange
if Marko died the same way.

38:05.584 --> 38:08.785
I didn't have a choice.

38:08.787 --> 38:12.555
If Marko sold his land,

38:12.557 --> 38:17.227
That would mean less water,
less grazing land for the sheep.

38:17.229 --> 38:19.629
In a year,
half our herd would be dead.

38:19.631 --> 38:22.165
Half our income gone.
We'd be ruined.

38:22.167 --> 38:24.768
You should have told me.

38:24.770 --> 38:29.973
You would have done nothing.
You're weak.

38:29.975 --> 38:32.175
He was the baby...
little basati.

38:32.177 --> 38:34.811
You gave him
anything he wanted.

38:34.813 --> 38:37.347
Someone had to
look out for this family!

38:37.349 --> 38:40.250
You are not our family!
You're not our blood!

38:40.252 --> 38:44.454
Okay, enough.
Walt, this is nuts.

38:44.456 --> 38:46.456
Let me radio the hospital,
tell them we're on our way.

38:46.458 --> 38:50.026
Don't bother.
It's not hemlock.

38:50.028 --> 38:53.263
Actually, this is elderberry
from my pocket.

38:53.265 --> 38:58.535
Looks like hemlock
except for the berries.

38:58.537 --> 39:00.904
And it won't kill you.

39:07.678 --> 39:09.512
Found Rosa Marquez.

39:09.514 --> 39:13.516
She was at big pines timber,
signing the sale papers

39:13.518 --> 39:16.319
For the land she inherited
from her late husband.

39:16.321 --> 39:18.021
How did they find her
so fast?

39:18.023 --> 39:21.291
Hard to say.

39:23.695 --> 39:25.795
Was there something else?

39:31.035 --> 39:32.869
Hello?

39:32.871 --> 39:34.704
Walt?
It's david mackey.

39:34.706 --> 39:37.874
I got a hit off of
one of the names you mentioned.

39:49.186 --> 39:52.021
We need to talk,
henry.

39:52.023 --> 39:54.424
Lizzie was waiting for you
here tonight.

39:54.426 --> 39:56.192
You should talk to her,
walt.

39:56.194 --> 39:58.995
She seems to think she's
in a relationship with you.

40:04.502 --> 40:07.337
There are certain things
that happened in denver

40:07.339 --> 40:09.205
That we've
never talked about.

40:09.207 --> 40:12.842
Things I need to know.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.862
Why now?

40:32.864 --> 40:35.932
Detective fales
is investigating you.

40:35.934 --> 40:39.436
You need to tell me
exactly what happened, henry.

40:44.642 --> 40:47.877
You are an honest man,
walt.

40:47.879 --> 40:50.079
I would like you
to stay that way.

40:50.081 --> 40:51.548
I will not
ask you to lie.

40:51.550 --> 40:53.249
It is not
your job to protect me.

40:53.251 --> 40:55.251
<i>It imy job,</i>

40:55.253 --> 40:56.653
And I wouldn't have to
protect you at all

40:56.655 --> 40:57.954
If you had just let me...

40:57.956 --> 41:00.390
You tried.

41:00.392 --> 41:03.059
And you nearly got yourself
killed in the process.

41:03.061 --> 41:07.464
Wasn't your job
to kill that man.

41:07.466 --> 41:11.668
That was mine to do.
That was my right.

41:19.777 --> 41:24.047
A good woman was murdered.

41:26.617 --> 41:30.820
A bad man is dead.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.722
End of story.

41:39.663 --> 41:43.099
If detective fales
insists on investigating me,

41:43.101 --> 41:46.436
He's free to do so.

41:46.438 --> 41:49.839
He will find
nothing useful.

41:49.841 --> 41:54.677
How can you be so sure?

41:54.679 --> 41:58.882
For such a spiritual man,
walt,

41:58.884 --> 42:02.185
You have a surprising
lack of faith.
