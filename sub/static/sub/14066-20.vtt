Clarence.

00:11.792 --> 00:14.564
Alan, you… you might
want to look at this.

00:14.760 --> 00:16.289
–Paternity suit?
–No.

00:16.816 --> 00:18.464
–Sexual harassment?
–No.

00:18.937 --> 00:21.336
–Emperor's club?
–Just… read it.

00:29.633 --> 00:30.227
I got in.

00:30.976 --> 00:33.286
I got in the auxiliary coast guard.

00:34.072 --> 00:34.560
Denny!

00:36.225 --> 00:36.621
Denny!

00:37.104 --> 00:39.366
Denny! Denny, I got in! I'm
in the coast guard!

00:39.406 --> 00:40.406
–What?
–Yeah.

00:40.727 --> 00:42.677
–Am I in? –I don't know.
Did you get a letter?

00:42.717 --> 00:44.901
I don't know.
I don't know. I…

00:52.188 --> 00:52.716
I'm in!

00:53.124 --> 00:53.886
I got in!

00:54.406 --> 00:56.056
We're in the coast guard!

00:56.456 --> 00:59.353
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
We're in the coast guard!

01:00.137 --> 01:01.440
We're in the coast guard!
Yes!

01:01.480 --> 01:03.526
Alan, we're in the coast guard!

01:04.416 --> 01:06.168
We're in the coast
guard!

01:07.152 --> 01:10.122
Aah! Aah! Coast guard!
Aah! Aah! Coast guard!

01:40.843 --> 01:42.531
You mean
they actually got in?

01:42.571 --> 01:45.723
We evidently need the soldiers.
Good morning, your honor.

01:45.763 --> 01:47.017
I'm not interested.

01:47.258 --> 01:50.426
I'm here to see Alan Shore.
If he's busy, interrupt him.

01:50.466 --> 01:52.275
–May I tell him what—
–No, you may not.

01:52.315 --> 01:55.087
You may tell him who.
Judge Harvey Cooper.

01:55.666 --> 01:57.547
You mean it's not
a social visit?

01:57.587 --> 02:00.123
I will not suffer
your sarcasm, Mr Shore.

02:00.163 --> 02:01.351
I do not like you.

02:01.435 --> 02:02.819
That having been said,

02:02.859 --> 02:04.803
I have enormous respect
for your legal skills.

02:04.843 --> 02:06.738
I'm here to hire you
in that capacity.

02:06.778 --> 02:07.563
Please sit.

02:08.898 --> 02:09.888
Why, thank you.

02:11.234 --> 02:12.752
I'm in the coast guard.

02:18.291 --> 02:20.643
Do you know where
I hail from, Mr Shore?

02:20.683 --> 02:23.282
A dark and scary place
with enchanted creatures?

02:23.322 --> 02:25.354
I'm from Concord, Massachusetts.

02:25.394 --> 02:26.515
Right.

02:26.778 --> 02:29.531
There's a reason I chose to reside
in Concord, Massachusetts.

02:29.571 --> 02:30.712
I'm an American.

02:31.065 --> 02:34.096
Concord, Massachusetts,
is where the minute men

02:34.136 --> 02:36.553
fought off the British,
personifying the heroism

02:36.593 --> 02:39.520
and patriotism of what it means
to be an American.

02:39.560 --> 02:41.408
Oh, I'm the coast guard, so…

02:42.256 --> 02:45.886
I come to you asking you
to represent our historic town

02:46.216 --> 02:48.592
in a rather drastic
cause of action.

02:49.712 --> 02:50.664
Which is?

02:51.272 --> 02:52.460
We wish to secede.

02:53.882 --> 02:54.577
Secede?

02:54.889 --> 02:57.331
From the union. We want independence.

02:57.705 --> 03:01.760
The people of Concord do not like
the direction of this country.

03:01.800 --> 03:06.296
In particular, its oppressive policies,
both abroad and here at home.

03:06.336 --> 03:08.144
It was Thomas Jefferson who said,

03:08.184 --> 03:10.662
“whenever any form of government
becomes destructive,

03:10.702 --> 03:13.846
”it is the right of the people
to alter or to abolish it

03:13.886 --> 03:16.130
”and to establish new government.”

03:17.182 --> 03:18.824
That is what we wish to do.

03:18.864 --> 03:22.824
The town council unanimously
voted to approve it last night.

03:23.197 --> 03:25.920
You wish to secede from
the United States of America?

03:25.960 --> 03:29.392
We wish to secede from
the United States of America.

03:31.654 --> 03:32.910
You're not serious.

03:33.367 --> 03:34.886
They really want to do it.

03:34.926 --> 03:37.047
And you agreed to represent them?

03:37.087 --> 03:40.294
Yes. And how's it going
with that bomb for Nantucket?

03:40.334 --> 03:43.040
–Alan, come on.
–It's been done, Shirley.

03:43.063 --> 03:45.446
In 1820, a rather large
chunk of Massachusetts

03:45.486 --> 03:47.662
seceded from the Commonwealth.
Today we call it Maine.

03:47.702 --> 03:48.950
That was 1820.

03:49.310 --> 03:51.230
Yes, and today there are
five different groups

03:51.270 --> 03:54.542
who are trying to secede from the United States?
–In February, the Secretary of State from Montana

03:54.582 --> 03:57.783
said they'd secede if the supreme court
limited firearm ownership.

03:57.823 --> 03:59.935
Maybe we could have a tea party.

04:09.350 --> 04:12.126
Did they give you a reason
for seceding?

04:12.623 --> 04:16.503
Yes, they want to hold
some neglected truths to be self-evident.

04:16.543 --> 04:18.083
Isn't it exciting?

04:23.154 --> 04:25.860
You left the room
rather abruptly, Denny.

04:26.242 --> 04:28.816
On the very day
we get in the military…

04:33.115 --> 04:34.303
What's the matter?

04:36.659 --> 04:38.754
I don't want you
to take this case.

04:38.794 --> 04:40.114
Well, I already did.

04:42.210 --> 04:46.632
For years, I've sat back, listening
to you criticize the US of A,

04:47.097 --> 04:50.331
accepting your premise
that dissent is patriotic.

04:51.553 --> 04:52.528
But seceding…

04:54.394 --> 04:56.770
I am a founding father of this firm.

04:57.112 --> 05:01.289
as senior partner, I'm asking you,
drop this matter now.

05:02.496 --> 05:03.552
I can't do that.

05:05.146 --> 05:07.553
This will affect
our friendship, Alan.

05:07.593 --> 05:10.553
I have great… faith
in our friendship.

05:11.537 --> 05:15.176
I trust it will survive
my taking this case.

05:18.832 --> 05:19.756
Get out, Alan.

05:21.928 --> 05:24.120
Denny, this isn't personal.
You have to know—

05:24.160 --> 05:25.560
Please, get out.

05:55.768 --> 05:58.440
What do you think
of this lawsuit Alan is bringing?

05:58.480 --> 05:59.866
Uh, Concord seceding?

06:00.224 --> 06:01.214
I'm against it.

06:02.464 --> 06:03.454
I have an idea.

06:04.889 --> 06:05.945
You had an idea.

06:06.016 --> 06:07.855
I get one… every leap year.

06:10.928 --> 06:12.984
Before we get
too far into this,

06:13.024 --> 06:15.856
I trust you've considered that
you and your entire township

06:15.896 --> 06:18.206
will be deemed anti-american.
–Yes.

06:18.552 --> 06:20.120
And that under
the patriot act,

06:20.160 --> 06:22.432
law enforcement
is practically required

06:22.472 --> 06:25.521
to investigate your motives…
Not just the mayor

06:25.561 --> 06:27.488
and the council, but the whole town.

06:27.528 --> 06:29.528
They get to dig into
everything in your lives…

06:29.568 --> 06:31.552
Your political affiliations, your
bank accounts,

06:31.592 --> 06:33.920
credit cards,
your e-mails, phone records,

06:33.960 --> 06:35.944
the books you've checked out
at the library,

06:35.984 --> 06:38.745
the videos you—
–Mr Shore, we understand fully

06:38.785 --> 06:40.232
the provisions of the patriot act

06:40.272 --> 06:43.012
and the litany of
governmental powers it bestows.

06:43.052 --> 06:45.708
That's one of the very reasons
we want to secede.

06:45.748 --> 06:47.244
You won't likely win.

06:47.636 --> 06:49.748
You gotta know that, judgie-boy.

06:51.292 --> 06:52.018
He's right.

06:52.236 --> 06:54.931
There is no way any court
is going to let a town secede

06:54.971 --> 06:57.411
from the United States.
–You just bring the motion.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.596
In an election year,
we'll settle for a shot

06:59.636 --> 07:03.052
heard round the world. –All we're looking
for is to survive summary judgment.

07:03.092 --> 07:05.600
If we can just get to
an actual trial—

07:05.804 --> 07:08.246
Right. There's your
political podium.

07:08.492 --> 07:10.208
You just bring the motion.

07:13.804 --> 07:15.837
Of all the ridiculous,

07:16.228 --> 07:17.372
absurd,

07:18.004 --> 07:19.204
preposterous,

07:19.580 --> 07:20.772
outlandish,

07:21.245 --> 07:24.215
far-fetched, incredulous—
–Bring it home now.

07:24.512 --> 07:26.918
–…outrageous…
–There we go.

07:27.454 --> 07:29.368
…cases you have ever brought.

07:29.630 --> 07:32.022
Your honor, I believe
if you just listened to us

07:32.062 --> 07:34.854
with that mind of yours,
which is so notoriously open,

07:34.894 --> 07:38.350
one can hear huge gusts of wind
swirling through on their way…

07:38.390 --> 07:42.902
A town cannot bring a lawsuit to
secede from the United States.

07:43.285 --> 07:46.350
Of course we can.
There's ample precedent for it,

07:46.390 --> 07:49.198
starting with the declaration
of independence, you hack.

07:49.238 --> 07:53.264
–Mr Cooper… –I am still judge
Cooper, especially to you, sir.

07:53.438 --> 07:54.718
And if you were a decent judge,

07:54.758 --> 07:56.238
you would understand
that the jurisdiction

07:56.278 --> 08:00.109
belongs in federal, not state court.
–And if you were a decent judge,

08:00.149 --> 08:01.440
you'd know that the federal courts,

08:01.480 --> 08:03.576
wanting two bites at
the apple to quash this,

08:03.616 --> 08:05.529
would first kick it
right back to state,

08:05.569 --> 08:09.823
hoping you'll do their work for them.
–And I plan to quash it, don't you worry.

08:09.863 --> 08:12.767
Whoa. Let's not do
any rash quashing, judge.

08:12.904 --> 08:15.192
All I ask is for you
to listen to us before—

08:15.232 --> 08:15.864
Why?

08:17.969 --> 08:18.433
Why?

08:19.368 --> 08:20.719
It's what judges do.

08:21.062 --> 08:23.902
They typically weigh the
merits before ruling on them.

08:23.942 --> 08:25.494
Did they not tell you this
in judging school?

08:25.534 --> 08:26.854
Go ahead and quash it now.

08:26.894 --> 08:29.245
That'll simply allow us to refile
with another judge,

08:29.285 --> 08:32.212
preferably one with an IQ
exceeding that of celery.

08:32.253 --> 08:35.553
So go ahead. Dismiss it.
We don't want you anyway.

08:36.876 --> 08:39.868
Well, you've got me.
I will hear this case.

08:40.364 --> 08:43.212
–Uh, wait. That's ridiculous.
–Of course you think it's ridiculous.

08:43.251 --> 08:44.948
You represent the Commonwealth.

08:44.988 --> 08:47.261
By the way, since
the attorney general's office

08:47.301 --> 08:48.572
is the Commonwealth,

08:48.612 --> 08:50.995
our first order of business
would be to disqualify you.

08:51.035 --> 08:53.267
You're the state. The state
is the defendant, judge.

08:53.307 --> 08:56.612
That would be a very clever tactic
if we weren't one step ahead of you.

08:56.652 --> 08:59.108
We've already hired outside,
independent counsel.

08:59.148 --> 09:01.476
In fact, outside counsel came to us.

09:01.516 --> 09:03.694
Really? Who?
I don't see anybody.

09:08.172 --> 09:09.426
You must be joking.

09:09.675 --> 09:11.596
The Commonwealth
has waived conflicts.

09:11.636 --> 09:14.540
Wait a second. The same
firm for both sides?

09:14.556 --> 09:16.668
–Saves on guest cast.
–Mr Shore?

09:16.948 --> 09:19.588
Concord will waive conflict,
your honor.

09:22.740 --> 09:23.420
5:00.

09:24.028 --> 09:25.216
Isn't it exciting?

09:25.579 --> 09:26.260
Could be.

09:27.580 --> 09:28.147
Denny…

09:28.652 --> 09:30.170
Nothing personal, Alan.

09:35.884 --> 09:37.220
This is a very bad idea.

09:37.260 --> 09:40.092
–It was Denny's.
–Oh, well, then…

09:40.444 --> 09:42.332
Shirley, now it is good
that we oppose.

09:42.372 --> 09:45.107
First, it will offset
any fallout this firm will get

09:45.147 --> 09:46.692
for representing
perceived traitors.

09:46.732 --> 09:48.516
Second, what they're doing
is wrong.

09:48.556 --> 09:50.068
Whatever one's problems
with America…

09:50.108 --> 09:52.780
You should be telling Alan to
withdraw, not Denny and me.

09:52.820 --> 09:53.908
Who's arguing?

09:54.316 --> 09:55.156
I am.

09:56.212 --> 09:59.076
But, Denny, you specifically
came to me and—

09:59.116 --> 10:00.036
For backup.

10:00.492 --> 10:02.556
I'll first chair.
–Well, Denny, I…

10:02.596 --> 10:05.698
I believe the client thinks
they're getting me.

10:05.764 --> 10:08.602
Why would they think that?
I'm Denny Crane.

10:10.068 --> 10:13.116
The problem is,
Alan knows you so well,

10:13.413 --> 10:15.636
he might be able to exploit
your weaknesses.

10:15.676 --> 10:18.453
You forget I know him.
I can exploit his weaknesses.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.935
Besides, I don't have
any weaknesses.

10:21.892 --> 10:23.014
I'll first chair.

10:33.988 --> 10:34.853
Denny, I…

10:36.515 --> 10:37.307
What's that?

10:39.550 --> 10:40.474
Rainbow trout.

10:40.726 --> 10:42.585
You'd know
if you ever caught one.

10:42.625 --> 10:46.861
–Can they survive in a tank like that?
–He won't have to live long.

10:46.901 --> 10:50.397
As soon as I catch him, I'm gonna eat him.
–You plan to fish for him?

10:50.437 --> 10:53.209
–Why wouldn't I?
–Is that really sporting?

10:55.118 --> 10:56.636
What do you want, Alan?

10:56.990 --> 10:59.637
Denny, I think you and I
trying a case…

10:59.973 --> 11:03.533
against each other
is a really, really bad idea.

11:04.245 --> 11:06.413
–Fine. Recuse yourself.
–I can't do that.

11:06.453 --> 11:07.693
I've given my word
to those people

11:07.733 --> 11:11.501
I'll represent them. –And I'm
defending my country against a traitor.

11:11.541 --> 11:14.445
This country was started
by traitors, Denny.

11:15.229 --> 11:17.454
I'm preparing a case.
Please leave.

11:17.494 --> 11:20.134
Denny, I don't want
to see you get hurt.

11:20.262 --> 11:22.157
Oh, you think
you'll win, hmm?

11:22.197 --> 11:24.301
I'll certainly survive
summary judgment.

11:24.341 --> 11:27.773
–$50,000 says you won't.
–I am not going to bet you.

11:27.949 --> 11:29.929
Chicken.
You know you'll lose.

11:30.422 --> 11:31.280
I won't lose.

11:32.111 --> 11:32.853
$50,000.

11:33.325 --> 11:36.309
Denny, I don't have to win
on the merits here.

11:36.349 --> 11:39.997
All I have to show is that
there's a possible case to be made.

11:40.037 --> 11:42.022
$50,000.

11:44.285 --> 11:46.957
How could you wager?
We're certain to lose.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.198
Not at the summary judgment.

11:48.238 --> 11:49.709
All the facts should be
construed in our favor.

11:49.749 --> 11:52.349
We're on the side of the
founding fathers here.

11:52.389 --> 11:54.005
The constitution stands for everything

11:54.045 --> 11:57.677
that the town of Concord is advocating.
–Let's not overplay the founding fathers.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.741
Most of them had slaves,
mistresses.

11:59.781 --> 12:02.071
Maybe that's where Spitzer
found his motivation.

12:02.111 --> 12:03.543
Love the dress, by the way.

12:03.583 --> 12:06.223
You could stop traffic today,
I tell ya.

12:07.495 --> 12:08.419
What was that?

12:09.279 --> 12:12.608
<i>The town of Concord, Massachusetts,
has actually filed a motion</i>

12:12.648 --> 12:14.713
<i>seeking to secede from
the United States</i>

12:14.753 --> 12:16.897
<i>and become
its own sovereign nation.</i>

12:16.937 --> 12:20.042
<i>There is legal precedent for the unusual…</i>
–Hey.

12:20.082 --> 12:21.180
<i>if not extraordinary act…</i>
–Hey.

12:21.220 --> 12:22.408
preparing my case.

12:22.524 --> 12:24.051
I can see that.

12:36.947 --> 12:39.460
You were once
a brilliant attorney.

12:40.651 --> 12:42.628
You're… you're not anymore.

12:43.732 --> 12:45.035
You're forgetful.

12:45.507 --> 12:47.751
You don't stay current
on the law.

12:47.779 --> 12:50.683
The last time I even saw you
open a law book

12:50.771 --> 12:54.335
was because you had a copy
of “rustler” tucked inside,

12:54.355 --> 12:56.027
which I see you found.

13:02.219 --> 13:04.755
The thing…
about Alan is

13:05.099 --> 13:07.524
he's not just
a gifted lawyer.

13:09.323 --> 13:11.369
His competitive ego is extreme.

13:12.036 --> 13:15.835
As much as he loves you, his first
priority will be winning this case.

13:15.875 --> 13:18.770
And, Denny…
he will tear you up.

13:19.468 --> 13:21.844
You are absolutely
no match for him.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.246
I don't want you
to handle this case.

13:28.099 --> 13:29.287
Not your decision.

13:32.539 --> 13:35.971
Now if you'll excuse me,
I've got a case to prepare.

13:39.627 --> 13:40.880
You, too, Alan.

13:58.720 --> 14:02.073
This is not about the people
of Concord hating America.

14:02.113 --> 14:03.301
Just the opposite.

14:03.305 --> 14:06.057
We are simply seeking to form
our own government,

14:06.097 --> 14:09.937
one that reflects the values
of an America that used to be.

14:09.977 --> 14:11.825
Which values are those, sir?

14:12.065 --> 14:13.737
Freedom of speech,
freedom of religion,

14:13.777 --> 14:15.625
majority rule, for starters.

14:15.896 --> 14:18.792
You don't think America
currently values those things?

14:18.832 --> 14:20.350
Certainly much less so.

14:20.618 --> 14:22.793
Today one does not even have
the right to protest

14:22.833 --> 14:24.747
at a presidential appearance.

14:24.977 --> 14:27.617
We have things called
free-speech zones.

14:27.777 --> 14:29.369
News crews are not allowed

14:29.409 --> 14:32.073
to film the return of
military caskets from Iraq,

14:32.113 --> 14:34.824
lest the public get the awful idea
that soldiers are being killed.

14:34.864 --> 14:40.012
This is censorship worthy of the cold war
Soviet Union, not the United States.

14:40.834 --> 14:43.012
Certainly not the America
I love.

14:43.273 --> 14:45.697
Well, since we are in a time of war,
maybe the rules—

14:45.737 --> 14:49.393
Yes, and typically in war, we
observe the Geneva convention.

14:49.433 --> 14:50.825
That's no longer the case.

14:50.865 --> 14:51.591
We torture.

14:52.032 --> 14:53.680
We lock people in prison
camps like Guantanamo,

14:53.720 --> 14:56.737
with no opportunity
for a real hearing.

14:57.240 --> 14:59.137
We are guilty of
the very oppression

14:59.177 --> 15:02.477
the colonists reared up against,
to begin America.

15:04.993 --> 15:05.983
Thank you, sir.

15:21.689 --> 15:24.481
Denny… uh, this would be
the point where you get up

15:24.521 --> 15:26.567
and ask a challenging question.

15:27.056 --> 15:28.112
Do you have any?

15:36.273 --> 15:37.329
What's going on?

15:37.601 --> 15:38.459
Not to worry…

15:39.689 --> 15:40.353
much.

15:41.857 --> 15:42.722
Your honor.

15:43.040 --> 15:44.426
–Mr Crane.
–Mr Crane.

15:52.041 --> 15:54.193
–You miss old America.
–That's exactly right.

15:54.233 --> 15:57.841
Oh, yeah. In old America, we
would never censor free speech.

15:57.881 --> 16:00.984
–No, we would not. –Even though
Woodrow Wilson jailed 5,000 Americans

16:01.024 --> 16:02.913
for speaking out
against World War I.

16:02.953 --> 16:05.705
–That's one example. Would you like a lollipop?
–And locking people up

16:05.745 --> 16:08.847
without giving them a hearing,
like Guantanamo?

16:09.216 --> 16:12.014
–Many of them innocent people.
–FDR jailed 100,000 japanese Americans,

16:12.054 --> 16:14.438
almost all of them innocent,
many of them children.

16:14.478 --> 16:17.799
The japanese internment camps
were an isolated incident

16:17.839 --> 16:19.823
for which we remain ashamed.

16:20.135 --> 16:21.782
One would hope we'd learn from it.

16:21.822 --> 16:24.806
It seems we haven't.
--Spying on our own citizens?

16:24.846 --> 16:27.743
That would never happen in
the America you grew up in. No.

16:27.783 --> 16:29.430
What about Nixon? He spied.

16:29.470 --> 16:31.751
Do I get a lollipop for Watergate?

16:32.167 --> 16:35.079
–Nixon did not represent the American val—
–What about LBJ?

16:35.119 --> 16:37.407
He used the FBI
to spy on reporters.

16:37.447 --> 16:40.493
Bill Clinton—
–You're gonna equate Bill Clinton

16:40.533 --> 16:41.565
with what goes on today?

16:41.605 --> 16:43.057
According to the ACLU,

16:43.133 --> 16:45.421
Bill Clinton expanded
stealth surveillance

16:45.461 --> 16:50.108
far beyond any previous administration ever,
and that was during a time of peace.

16:50.148 --> 16:52.645
Bill Clinton certainly never
tortured people.

16:52.685 --> 16:54.309
No. He practiced rendition.

16:54.349 --> 16:57.693
Shipping suspects off to other countries,
like Saudi Arabia, Egypt,

16:57.733 --> 17:00.069
and they tortured for us.

17:00.981 --> 17:03.925
During the cold war,
we did human experimentation…

17:03.965 --> 17:05.025
Innocent people…

17:05.361 --> 17:07.560
College students, mental
patients.

17:07.601 --> 17:11.123
government-run experiments
on unknowing victims.

17:11.882 --> 17:14.720
We tested everything
from LSD to nerve gas.

17:15.049 --> 17:17.401
We exposed unwitting
black men to syphilis,

17:17.441 --> 17:18.888
trying to discover a cure.

17:18.929 --> 17:20.217
We used them as guinea pigs.

17:20.257 --> 17:24.969
No, judge, you haven't named
one thing America's doing today

17:25.376 --> 17:28.610
that we haven't been doing
for a long, long time.

17:36.753 --> 17:38.871
–He was good.
–He was very good.

17:39.127 --> 17:41.383
Never would know he's dying
from Alzheimer's,

17:41.423 --> 17:44.247
not with that little performance.
–He's not dying.

17:44.287 --> 17:47.375
–I'm sorry. I just meant—
–Why would you say that?

17:47.415 --> 17:48.366
Well…

17:49.815 --> 17:51.399
people with Alzheimer's…

17:51.967 --> 17:54.223
…there's no cure.
–I know there's no cure,

17:54.263 --> 17:56.591
but people can live with it, Jerry,
sometimes for a very long time.

17:56.631 --> 18:00.232
That was a terrible thing to say.
–I'm sorry.

18:08.607 --> 18:09.465
What's wrong?

18:10.583 --> 18:13.255
I'll tell you what's wrong.
I'm not his whipping boy.

18:13.295 --> 18:15.869
Ich fuhle machtig,
dahmi dahmi dahmino.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.048
What language was that?

18:18.088 --> 18:18.946
Swiss-German.

18:19.294 --> 18:21.670
Oh, dear. It's come
to Swiss-German.

18:27.823 --> 18:30.463
Would you excuse us
for a minute, Katie?

18:38.638 --> 18:39.760
Jerry, I'm sorry.

18:43.062 --> 18:46.607
I've been stressed out
with this trial.

18:48.487 --> 18:50.797
And I guess
I've gotten so used to…

18:51.135 --> 18:53.336
calling it “mad cow,” I…

18:55.174 --> 18:56.956
I forget what it really is.

19:02.519 --> 19:08.423
You seem to be going to
the wooden cigarette a lot more lately.

19:09.471 --> 19:10.461
Anything wrong?

19:10.582 --> 19:10.942
No.

19:15.382 --> 19:16.900
I feel as if I haven't…

19:19.039 --> 19:21.415
seen much of you
over the last year.

19:22.415 --> 19:26.309
We haven't really spoken
since, uh, the troubles with Dana.

19:26.439 --> 19:29.238
Well, you've been
really busy, Alan.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.286
So have I, with work.

19:31.886 --> 19:32.918
Work has…

19:36.686 --> 19:40.316
Hey, that's the beauty of being
good friends, isn't it?

19:41.391 --> 19:43.447
Relationships
with long shelf lives,

19:43.487 --> 19:46.589
you can just stick 'em
on the shelf, I tell ya.

19:50.198 --> 19:50.806
What?

19:57.151 --> 19:59.295
I have never, ever
considered myself

19:59.335 --> 20:02.041
someone who puts work
before friendships.

20:07.287 --> 20:08.183
Seems I do.

20:09.647 --> 20:10.703
We all do, Alan.

20:12.671 --> 20:15.151
Friendships are a little like
backyard gardens.

20:15.191 --> 20:16.775
We plan to tend to them…

20:20.078 --> 20:23.312
We just always seem to
put it off till next week.

20:46.902 --> 20:48.023
Catch anything?

20:48.774 --> 20:50.094
Not yet, but I will.

20:51.787 --> 20:53.859
You were quite something
in court yesterday.

20:53.899 --> 20:55.813
Oh, thank you.
Appreciate it.

20:56.675 --> 20:59.513
Denny, could you stop fishing
for a minute?

21:01.058 --> 21:03.747
I'm feeling uncomfortable
about the bet.

21:05.002 --> 21:07.444
We don't need
the kind of competition

21:07.634 --> 21:10.755
or… animosity that a bet
like that can fuel.

21:12.411 --> 21:13.474
Plus—

21:13.842 --> 21:15.771
–You're losing.
–I'm not losing.

21:15.811 --> 21:17.329
Oh, yes, you're losing.

21:17.858 --> 21:20.922
Do you understand
how summary judgment goes?

21:21.522 --> 21:23.964
The burden is totally
on the defense.

21:24.291 --> 21:27.426
You must prove there are
no credible facts whatsoever

21:27.466 --> 21:30.096
upon which relief
can be granted.

21:31.232 --> 21:35.456
It's all but impossible for defendants
to win summary judgments.

21:35.872 --> 21:36.532
Double it?

21:39.050 --> 21:39.409
Fine.

21:39.920 --> 21:40.256
Fine.

21:41.881 --> 21:42.872
Just no doing your closing

21:42.912 --> 21:45.144
in that minuteman outfit
with the musket.

21:45.184 --> 21:47.692
Remember how the jury
just loved that?

21:47.696 --> 21:49.288
Especially with money
riding on this thing,

21:49.328 --> 21:51.753
it would be unfair for you to
take advantage like that.

21:51.793 --> 21:54.895
Promise me you won't wear
the minuteman outfit.

21:57.848 --> 21:58.442
Nice try.

22:09.776 --> 22:10.832
He's doing well?

22:11.913 --> 22:12.573
Extremely.

22:13.817 --> 22:16.589
You know, Denny may have
mad cow, Shirley,

22:16.592 --> 22:18.496
but I don't think
the cow is winning.

22:18.536 --> 22:19.724
Where are you now?

22:20.072 --> 22:24.890
–We've got a retired general testifying,
then we close. –Denny's closing?

22:25.096 --> 22:26.672
He must be on some kind
of medication.

22:26.712 --> 22:30.672
I don't know, but, uh, all
I can say is, he's actually good.

22:32.649 --> 22:35.025
Old America?
Are you kidding me?

22:35.633 --> 22:38.128
We don't live in old America.
This is a new world.

22:38.168 --> 22:41.534
The enemy isn't countries
or states or governments.

22:41.864 --> 22:44.632
It's terrorists capable
of attacking us here.

22:44.672 --> 22:46.528
Hell, they have attacked us here.

22:46.568 --> 22:49.616
This is new warfare
requiring new tactics.

22:50.025 --> 22:52.137
–Including torture?
–Absolutely.

22:52.320 --> 22:55.356
Look, if we have a suspect
who has information

22:55.592 --> 22:59.256
that a bomb is about to go off,
possibly killing thousands of Americans,

22:59.296 --> 23:02.144
are you really suggesting
we… we treat him gently,

23:02.184 --> 23:05.240
that we don't do everything
we can to save american lives?

23:05.280 --> 23:07.128
I… I'm not saying it.
He is.

23:08.441 --> 23:12.176
Look…
I long for yesterday myself.

23:12.640 --> 23:16.680
We used to know how to fight a war
and not trip over ourselves,

23:16.720 --> 23:19.480
but we still stand
for the same principles.

23:19.520 --> 23:20.840
That hasn't changed.

23:23.369 --> 23:24.857
I'm confused.

23:25.416 --> 23:28.456
Those principles you say
we still stand for,

23:28.768 --> 23:33.328
do they include human rights, the
fair and humane treatment of prisoners?

23:33.368 --> 23:36.320
I'm saying, while those values
remain important,

23:36.360 --> 23:38.137
we have to put them in perspective

23:38.177 --> 23:41.873
given the world we now live in.
–And what world is that?

23:42.281 --> 23:44.273
–One of terrorism.
–Right.

23:44.608 --> 23:47.376
One where the muslim world…
much of it… hates us

23:47.416 --> 23:50.224
and would love to see the destruction
of the United States.

23:50.264 --> 23:53.041
Tell me, do you make any room
for the possibility…

23:53.081 --> 23:55.744
any room whatsoever…
that the conduct of our country,

23:55.784 --> 23:58.609
be it starting a war under false pretenses—
–Democrat.

23:58.649 --> 24:01.392
Move to strike. This isn't
republicans vs democrats.

24:01.432 --> 24:03.616
–Oh, right.
–The democrats, virtually all of them,

24:03.656 --> 24:05.648
have supported the worst
of Bush's policies.

24:05.688 --> 24:08.544
Only one democrat in the senate
opposed the patriot act

24:08.584 --> 24:11.793
when it was first proposed. They stumbled
over each other rushing to sign a blank check.

24:11.833 --> 24:15.156
I hardly stand here as a proud democrat.
–Nor do you stand as a loyal American.

24:15.196 --> 24:17.708
–Oh, come on. –We don't question
your country in a time of war.

24:17.748 --> 24:19.660
Why the hell not?
That to me seems like

24:19.700 --> 24:22.332
an especially apt time to ask questions.
–Mr Shore.

24:22.372 --> 24:24.340
I don't know who the hell
came up with the notion that

24:24.380 --> 24:26.396
one can't criticize this
country and still be patriotic.

24:26.436 --> 24:28.484
I bet it was Cheney.
Well, he was wrong.

24:28.524 --> 24:31.692
Some of our most noble
patriots were dissenters…

24:31.747 --> 24:35.594
–Henry David Thoreau, Susan B. Anthony—
–Are we doing closings now?

24:35.634 --> 24:37.346
–Would you like to? I'm ready.
–Would've worn the outfit.

24:37.386 --> 24:38.890
Why don't you just shut up instead?

24:38.930 --> 24:40.712
That's enough, both of you.

24:42.770 --> 24:43.803
Mr Shore…

24:45.002 --> 24:46.718
Do you have anything else?

24:53.346 --> 24:54.242
No.

25:33.330 --> 25:35.244
Working on my closing.
Later.

25:38.322 --> 25:40.896
I'm sorry about
telling you to shut up.

25:45.467 --> 25:50.290
Can we agree just to try this case
and not let it get personal?

25:56.002 --> 25:57.586
Come in, Alan. Sit down.

26:05.746 --> 26:06.986
Something I thought
you understood,

26:07.026 --> 26:09.204
but you clearly don't understand…

26:12.122 --> 26:15.224
for people of my generation,
being an American…

26:15.714 --> 26:16.506
is personal.

26:17.474 --> 26:18.435
I realize—

26:18.770 --> 26:21.291
No, you don't. You don't.

26:22.818 --> 26:24.468
In your life, growing up,

26:24.714 --> 26:27.442
you just took for granted
that America would always be.

26:27.482 --> 26:31.376
Why not? It's a superpower,
strongest country in the world.

26:31.706 --> 26:34.210
In my lifetime, with Hitler
trying to take over the world

26:34.250 --> 26:35.906
and having the means to do so,

26:35.946 --> 26:39.510
we went to bed scared at night
that America would end.

26:41.562 --> 26:43.344
Imagine that feeling, Alan.

26:45.986 --> 26:47.768
The tragedy for me here is…

26:49.098 --> 26:51.804
you have no idea
how deeply offended I am

26:52.035 --> 26:54.873
by the idea that a town…
wanting to secede.

26:54.931 --> 26:55.723
You have no…

27:02.408 --> 27:03.200
Which means…

27:04.614 --> 27:06.198
you don't know me, Alan,

27:07.542 --> 27:08.268
not really.

27:11.046 --> 27:14.676
Our friendship has all the depth
of a jigger of scotch.

27:22.606 --> 27:25.642
I really need to work
on my closing right now.

27:50.270 --> 27:53.174
Why are you wearing
that ridiculous costume?

27:53.814 --> 27:55.860
It's not a costume,
your honor.

27:56.142 --> 27:58.958
I'm a member of the United States
auxiliary coast guard.

27:58.998 --> 28:01.662
I stand ready to defend
my country against enemies,

28:01.702 --> 28:03.220
high crime and treason.

28:03.598 --> 28:05.647
Objection. I object
to the implication—

28:05.687 --> 28:07.294
Oh, Mr Shore, sit down.

28:07.710 --> 28:10.222
Thank you, your honor.
I'll make this short.

28:10.262 --> 28:13.206
It is my belief that the best
closing arguments are short.

28:13.246 --> 28:15.870
There's a lot to criticize
about America today.

28:15.910 --> 28:16.900
I realize that.

28:16.983 --> 28:19.422
Truth be told, I'm embarrassed
by the current administration.

28:19.462 --> 28:20.127
Who isn't?

28:20.590 --> 28:23.759
But whatever one wants to say
about George Bush,

28:24.166 --> 28:27.532
there can be no question
that he loves his country.

28:27.734 --> 28:30.062
He once made a simple statement
that, simply put,

28:30.102 --> 28:32.782
reflects who and what he is.
–Simple?

28:33.158 --> 28:34.015
Mr Shore.

28:34.430 --> 28:37.532
He said, “you're either with
us or against us.”

28:37.575 --> 28:40.038
The town of Concord
comes into court, says…

28:40.078 --> 28:45.142
they no longer choose to be with us.
They want to abandon America.

28:45.910 --> 28:50.080
It is the most unpatriotic
act of heresy imaginable.

28:52.278 --> 28:53.136
It's treason.

28:54.494 --> 28:56.271
Your honor, if you allow
this case to continue

28:56.311 --> 28:58.430
a week, a day, an hour,

28:59.446 --> 29:02.334
you are saying that abandoning
America in a time of war

29:02.374 --> 29:04.350
is conceivably acceptable.

29:05.670 --> 29:09.590
If you love this nation just one
fraction of what George Bush does

29:09.630 --> 29:16.950
or I do or most Americans do,
you cannot possibly find that acceptable.

29:36.502 --> 29:40.622
Not too long ago, we set
the example for the world

29:41.030 --> 29:43.518
on civil liberties
and human rights.

29:45.550 --> 29:46.110
Today…

29:49.334 --> 29:53.758
Today we have this bipartisan
piece of legislation…

29:54.502 --> 29:56.599
the patriot act…
that criminalizes free speech,

29:56.639 --> 29:58.518
authorizes warrantless searches,

29:58.558 --> 30:01.396
allows for wiretaps
without probable cause.

30:01.582 --> 30:04.639
People can now be locked up
on suspicion alone,

30:04.679 --> 30:07.631
denied due process
or even a hearing.

30:08.382 --> 30:09.868
As for foreign nationals,
forget it.

30:09.908 --> 30:11.925
They can be deported
for what they say or think,

30:11.965 --> 30:13.461
even if they're
completely law-abiding.

30:13.501 --> 30:17.178
They can be kept from ever entering this
country under the ideological exclusion rule,

30:17.218 --> 30:19.090
again, based on what
they say or think.

30:19.130 --> 30:22.867
All this accomplished by a bill that
our leaders rushed to pass

30:22.907 --> 30:25.811
just six weeks
after those towers came down.

30:27.618 --> 30:30.138
Did you… read
the patriot act, judge?

30:31.330 --> 30:33.082
Members of congress
certainly didn't.

30:33.122 --> 30:35.138
It was pushed through
with so much haste,

30:35.178 --> 30:37.356
there was
almost no deliberation.

30:37.378 --> 30:40.642
Because few if any members
of the house of senate

30:40.891 --> 30:42.106
had bothered to read it…

30:42.146 --> 30:43.314
—most still haven't—

30:43.354 --> 30:47.970
A bill that mocks our constitution
and moves us ever closer to tyranny.

30:48.010 --> 30:51.904
We now round up suspects
and throw them in detention camps,

30:52.226 --> 30:53.978
claiming they're not
prisoners of war

30:54.018 --> 30:57.442
so that we may torture them
in violation of the Geneva convention.

30:57.482 --> 31:00.930
We set up these camps in Cuba
and other foreign locations.

31:00.970 --> 31:04.787
This is not something done by a
government with moral integrity.

31:04.827 --> 31:07.787
It does not reflect a nation
with a conscience.

31:07.827 --> 31:10.005
And let's talk about the torture.

31:10.130 --> 31:13.114
This isn't slapping around some suspect
who knows of a ticking bomb.

31:13.154 --> 31:15.634
We now use torture
as a matter of course.

31:15.674 --> 31:19.954
We use it against people just to see if
they have information, any information.

31:19.994 --> 31:22.834
Torture is no longer
the exception, but the rule.

31:22.874 --> 31:23.798
It's systemic.

31:24.203 --> 31:26.447
Waterboarding,
sexual humiliation,

31:26.698 --> 31:29.404
extreme psychological
and physical abuse…

31:29.410 --> 31:34.403
We all know the horrors of Abu Ghraib.
And those orders came from the very top.

31:34.443 --> 31:37.667
George Bush knew
and approved of these tactics,

31:37.930 --> 31:42.088
as did Rummy, Condi, Dick,
Ashcroft, Tenent, even Colin Powell.

31:42.106 --> 31:46.290
They all knew and participated in
creating the policy, as did many others,

31:46.330 --> 31:48.443
and yet not one high-ranking officer

31:48.483 --> 31:52.971
or member of this administration has
been held accountable, not one.

31:55.426 --> 31:57.406
We set up these secret prisons

31:57.450 --> 32:00.750
using techniques modeled on
the dungeons of Egypt.

32:00.843 --> 32:02.826
We chain prisoners to ceilings,
we subject them

32:02.866 --> 32:04.715
to simulated drownings
or sexual abuse.

32:04.755 --> 32:06.669
This is not moral leadership.

32:06.706 --> 32:08.683
This is not the conduct of a country

32:08.723 --> 32:11.759
that regards the law or
respects human rights.

32:12.435 --> 32:15.922
And the country I speak of
is not Egypt or Saudi Arabia

32:15.962 --> 32:17.282
or even North Korea.

32:17.498 --> 32:21.458
It's the United States of America…
my country, your country.

32:25.234 --> 32:27.940
Denny Crane said to me
that I cannot know

32:28.178 --> 32:35.570
the experience of lying down at night
and facing the idea of losing America.

32:38.650 --> 32:41.274
Since September 11, 2001,

32:41.602 --> 32:44.002
I think most of us have
laid down on many a night

32:44.042 --> 32:45.758
and imagined exactly that.

32:46.498 --> 32:47.226
But I wonder,

32:47.266 --> 32:50.674
what is it about America
that we most fear losing?

32:51.178 --> 32:54.906
and I wonder, how much of that
have we lost already?

32:58.954 --> 33:01.138
The town of Concord…
what can it really do,

33:01.178 --> 33:05.468
stage a protest, have a rally,
a parade, call a press conference?

33:05.499 --> 33:07.243
Would that even make the news?

33:07.283 --> 33:10.643
But threaten to secede, that
would get some attention.

33:10.683 --> 33:13.058
and if you look at
all the facts here,

33:13.098 --> 33:16.362
you'll see Concord isn't really
seeking to leave America at all.

33:16.402 --> 33:17.858
It's America that has left them.

33:17.898 --> 33:19.298
And, of course, ultimately,

33:19.338 --> 33:21.162
Concord will not be
allowed to secede.

33:21.202 --> 33:22.194
We all know that.

33:22.234 --> 33:25.163
But if you quash this at the
summary judgment stage,

33:25.203 --> 33:27.458
you will, in effect, be ruling
that their concerns

33:27.498 --> 33:28.794
are not even legitimate.

33:28.834 --> 33:31.738
And how can any true American
conclude that?

33:36.251 --> 33:39.946
We stand here today
asking you to defend a democracy

33:40.266 --> 33:43.764
that our congress and
our president refuse to defend.

33:43.795 --> 33:45.706
We're asking you to stand up
for the constitution,

33:45.746 --> 33:48.210
which every judge is
duty-bound to protect.

33:48.250 --> 33:51.626
We ask you to stand up for
an America that, 60 years ago,

33:51.666 --> 33:55.032
our soldiers stormed a beach
in Normandy to defend.

33:56.451 --> 34:00.015
This case is personal to you,
and it's personal to me.

34:00.180 --> 34:03.084
It's personal to everyone
in this courtroom.

34:03.867 --> 34:05.649
I love this country, Denny.

34:07.652 --> 34:08.612
I just…

34:10.773 --> 34:13.956
sometimes, I just don't
recognize it anymore.

35:05.960 --> 35:09.208
I, like many Americans,
am horrified

35:10.264 --> 35:13.234
that our government
tortures prisoners of war

35:13.888 --> 35:15.968
that we've turned
our police powers…

35:16.008 --> 35:18.481
many of them illegal…
against our own citizens.

35:18.521 --> 35:20.761
If the goal of the terrorists
on 9/11

35:20.801 --> 35:22.649
was to knock down democracy,

35:23.571 --> 35:25.683
then they surely have succeeded.

35:26.600 --> 35:28.083
But I, like many Americans,

35:28.123 --> 35:31.225
care more about
the protection of our children,

35:31.350 --> 35:32.526
grandchildren…

35:33.734 --> 35:35.714
than I do our nation's ideals.

35:36.559 --> 35:38.341
I do not doubt for a moment

35:38.855 --> 35:41.985
that the government is acting
in good faith to make us safe.

35:42.025 --> 35:44.752
No do I doubt that if there's
any time in our nation's history

35:44.792 --> 35:47.828
when we must simply
stick together, it is now.

35:50.802 --> 35:53.857
The concerns and questions
you have raised, Mr Shore,

35:53.897 --> 35:59.274
are indeed legitimate, but I cannot
and I will not allow to stand

35:59.601 --> 36:04.251
Concord's motion
to secede from this country.

36:07.240 --> 36:08.296
We're adjourned.

36:16.057 --> 36:16.737
Still undefeated.

36:16.777 --> 36:17.767
Never in doubt.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.243
How about our friendship?

36:22.761 --> 36:25.929
A man is never so rich
as he is with friendship…

36:26.041 --> 36:29.671
except when he's got $50,000.
–I thought we doubled it.

36:29.777 --> 36:33.867
I'll give you half off
'cause I like you.

36:37.168 --> 36:38.290
Walk out with me?

36:38.376 --> 36:38.888
Please.

36:57.537 --> 36:58.337
Men's room.

36:59.464 --> 37:00.561
I got it wrong.

37:01.065 --> 37:03.177
No biggie.
The stalls are empty.

37:03.673 --> 37:07.265
I got it wrong about your no longer
being a brilliant attorney.

37:07.305 --> 37:08.657
Seems you still are.

37:11.584 --> 37:12.177
Sex?

37:14.392 --> 37:15.184
Not tonight.

37:15.448 --> 37:17.272
Oh. I had a dream.

37:18.433 --> 37:21.469
You and I were swimming
in my pool buck naked.

37:21.593 --> 37:23.705
We began
to make ferocious love.

37:23.738 --> 37:24.841
You screamed so loudly

37:24.881 --> 37:26.529
the police came
and looked over the fence

37:26.569 --> 37:30.001
and said, “oh, that's just
Crane, pool and Schmidt.”

37:33.786 --> 37:37.305
And on that lovely note,
good night, Denny.

37:38.465 --> 37:39.601
And way to go.

38:00.313 --> 38:02.161
She's still in love with me.

38:05.976 --> 38:07.626
Everybody loves a winner.

38:10.833 --> 38:12.021
You were pathetic,

38:12.377 --> 38:15.479
trying to get me to wear
that minuteman outfit.

38:17.377 --> 38:18.953
You wore it before.

38:20.890 --> 38:22.865
I actually did listen
to your closing.

38:22.905 --> 38:24.159
Almost made me cry.

38:25.329 --> 38:26.104
Really?

38:26.441 --> 38:29.785
Yeah, 'cause for a second there,
I thought you'd win.

38:29.825 --> 38:31.129
Let me ask you a question.

38:31.169 --> 38:35.249
Don't you get tired of going on
and on and on like that?

38:36.545 --> 38:37.281
Yes.

38:38.625 --> 38:41.473
When you think of the hours
and hours I've spent

38:41.513 --> 38:42.880
standing in front of a jury…

38:42.920 --> 38:43.580
Let's not.

38:46.411 --> 38:47.937
Jerry said something about

38:47.977 --> 38:51.193
how we don't tend to
the friendships in our lives.

38:51.233 --> 38:53.279
We do, every night,
right here.

38:53.489 --> 38:54.409
Yes, but…

38:56.889 --> 39:00.057
When I consider my job,
with all those closings…

39:00.128 --> 39:02.801
–Endless closings.
–…many of them quite personal…

39:02.841 --> 39:04.305
–Long-winded closings.
–All right.

39:04.345 --> 39:05.533
What's your point?

39:06.225 --> 39:09.723
My point is, I've spent perhaps
most of my adult life

39:10.057 --> 39:13.808
talking and talking
and talking to strangers.

39:15.553 --> 39:19.208
Why don't people take more time
to be with the ones they love?

39:19.248 --> 39:20.337
Why don't we take more vacations?

39:20.377 --> 39:22.121
We keep talking about
going fishing again.

39:22.161 --> 39:24.321
My god, you bought a trout
from a pet store.

39:24.361 --> 39:28.873
Alan… Let's go. Now.

39:29.657 --> 39:31.121
I'm being serious, Denny.

39:31.161 --> 39:31.882
So am I.

39:33.697 --> 39:37.377
Let's hang the “gone fishin'”
sign on the door and go.

39:40.073 --> 39:40.489
Where?

39:41.353 --> 39:43.393
We'll start with the Charles river,

39:43.433 --> 39:45.457
go from there.
Road trip, you and me.

39:45.497 --> 39:47.959
–Don't tease me. I'll do it.
–I'm not teasing. Let's go.

39:47.999 --> 39:51.039
We'll camp, we'll fish,
we'll toast marshmallows.

39:51.079 --> 39:51.739
Same tent.

39:52.191 --> 39:56.123
Separate sleeping bags.
Come on. Nature awaits.

39:56.711 --> 39:58.655
Oh, god. Why'd you
have to bring up nature?

39:58.695 --> 40:00.215
You know I hate nature.

40:00.591 --> 40:01.911
I'll hold your hand.

40:01.927 --> 40:05.287
What was that quote you said
from Ralph Waldo Emerson?

40:05.327 --> 40:07.109
He said quite a few things.

40:07.743 --> 40:13.319
