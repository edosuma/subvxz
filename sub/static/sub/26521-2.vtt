Old people. The wrinkled menace.

00:50.216 --> 00:53.261
I agree they're shady, sir,
but how are they a menace?

00:53.344 --> 00:57.223
Babies are the most adorable,
lovable things on the planet.

00:57.307 --> 01:01.853
Old folks are like the raisins of people,
and we're the chocolate chips.

01:01.936 --> 01:05.190
It's not what they are, Stace.
It's what they want.

01:05.273 --> 01:11.029
Mashed food, warm milk, frequent naps,
their family's constant attention.

01:11.196 --> 01:13.364
Quality diaper products.

01:13.448 --> 01:16.117
-I like all those things.
-Exactly.

01:16.201 --> 01:18.036
I can't believe we didn't see it sooner.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.497
Old people
are babies' natural competitors.

01:20.580 --> 01:22.415
-[gasps]
-Indeed.

01:22.499 --> 01:26.044
How long before they come
after babies' share of the world's love?

01:26.127 --> 01:27.921
-Uh--
-Don't answer! Too late.

01:28.254 --> 01:31.758
Because unless I'm mistaken, not possible,
one of these old people

01:31.841 --> 01:34.803
is already looking to take babies down.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.471
Frederic Estes.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.472
[both gasp]

01:37.555 --> 01:40.266
I think he's onto us and after us.

01:40.433 --> 01:44.437
-He could be the next Bootsy Calico!
-Not if we stop him now.

01:44.521 --> 01:46.314
Can you please wrap this up?

01:46.564 --> 01:50.944
Oh, sorry, temporary summertime roommate.
We'll try to keep it down.

01:51.152 --> 01:54.864
We can't sit around and wait for this
crank to blossom into another archnemesis.

01:54.948 --> 02:00.453
No. We're gonna protect Baby Corp's love
and make a splash with our new CEO.

02:00.537 --> 02:04.999
-This time, we strike first.
-Yes, yes, yes!

02:05.083 --> 02:08.336
Jiminy Christmas, you guys.
Don't tell Mom I swore.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.380
Strike plan. Ideas by tomorrow.

02:10.463 --> 02:14.050
I want Frederic Estes' head on a platter
for Turtleneck Superstar CEO Baby

02:14.134 --> 02:15.677
-by the end of the week.
-[Staci] Yeah!

02:15.760 --> 02:18.221
Head guts! Let's ride.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.807
-[Jimbo neighs]
-[Staci laughs]

02:21.141 --> 02:22.600
It's a figure of speech, Staci.

02:22.684 --> 02:24.978
We're not severing any actual--
Well, she's excited.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.356
How about you, Templeton?
Any anti-Estes ideas?

02:28.439 --> 02:32.068
Really not getting involved in this one.
I like old people.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.194
[Boss Baby laughs]

02:33.862 --> 02:35.155
Classic Templeton.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.656
I'm serious.

02:36.739 --> 02:39.117
Bootsy Calico and his cats
were freaky and evil,

02:39.200 --> 02:41.077
but old people aren't either
of those things.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.997
-They make me happy.
-That's mathematically impossible.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.458
You're over a thousand percent closer
to baby age than old people age.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.211
How could they possibly make you happy?

02:50.336 --> 02:54.090
-Oh, this is about her.
-[Gigi] Knock, knock.

02:54.173 --> 02:57.802
Is it too late to say good night
to my big grandson?

02:57.969 --> 02:59.804
Not for either one of us.

03:00.054 --> 03:02.807
What in-- Did you let him out of his crib?

03:02.891 --> 03:06.978
Uh, I guess that's the only explanation
that makes sense.

03:07.103 --> 03:07.937
[Gigi] Unh-unh.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.524
We talked about this, bossy britches.
You don't get to run this house anymore.

03:11.649 --> 03:14.068
Cute and sassy doesn't cut it
with your Gigi.

03:14.152 --> 03:15.737
-[Boss Baby farts, giggles]
-Ugh!

03:15.820 --> 03:19.032
Oh, we are gonna work on that attitude
this summer.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.409
And as for you, young man,

03:21.492 --> 03:24.037
did somebody place an order
at the tickle factory?

03:24.120 --> 03:26.581
Oh, no, I ordered too many.
Send them back!

03:26.664 --> 03:28.499
[Gigi laughs]

03:28.625 --> 03:30.460
Good night, Timmy.

03:34.631 --> 03:35.715
[blows raspberry]

03:36.216 --> 03:39.844
[laughs] She's the best.
You two should try harder to get along.

03:39.928 --> 03:43.097
I like you and I like her,
so, mathematically,

03:43.181 --> 03:45.892
that's like a thousand percent chance
you'll like each other.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.644
[groans] Public schools.

03:47.727 --> 03:51.272
Brass tacks, Templeton.
I'm a baby, she's a senior citizen.

03:51.356 --> 03:54.567
War's coming,
and Gigi and I are in opposite camps.

03:54.651 --> 03:58.321
Sooner or later, you have to pick a side.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.493
-Pick Team Baby!
-[Tim yells]

04:04.077 --> 04:06.829
These are your Frederic Estes
strike plans?

04:06.913 --> 04:08.915
Nunchucks are the only plan I need.

04:08.998 --> 04:11.834
And I brought this thumb
to agree with Staci's plan.

04:12.085 --> 04:12.919
[groaning]

04:13.002 --> 04:14.504
We have to send a message.

04:14.587 --> 04:18.049
Humiliate Estes,
let him know this is a baby town.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.927
You come after our love,
we don't run and hide.

04:21.010 --> 04:22.595
-[Tim and Gigi laugh]
-Ahh! Run and hide!

04:22.679 --> 04:25.765
-You're gonna be on TV?
-[chuckles] Maybe.

04:25.848 --> 04:27.475
Marsha Krinkle's doing a fluff piece

04:27.558 --> 04:29.769
on a charity pinochle tournament
at the senior center.

04:29.852 --> 04:31.604
It was my friend Frederic's idea.

04:31.688 --> 04:32.522
Hmm?

04:33.064 --> 04:35.817
-You wanna come?
-You think I could be on TV?

04:36.150 --> 04:39.696
Who knows? I made the local news once.
Well, my mug shot did.

04:39.779 --> 04:42.115
The boss tried to take away
our dental plan,

04:42.198 --> 04:44.993
so I cracked his tooth with a forearm.
[cracking sound]

04:45.660 --> 04:50.039
-I could make cookies for the old folks.
-Oh, sure. That'd be easier.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.958
Start your baking and we'll head over
in a bit.

04:52.041 --> 04:55.253
I'm gonna be on TV!
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes!

04:56.838 --> 05:01.467
-Jimbo, Staci, I have our strike plan.
-[Staci and Jimbo giggle]

05:02.593 --> 05:07.056
Hi, I'm Timothy Templeton.
Hello, I'm Timothy Templeton.

05:07.432 --> 05:09.350
-Shalom, I'm Tim--
-Templeton!

05:09.434 --> 05:12.145
Stirring like a real pro.
What you got there, cookies?

05:12.228 --> 05:16.357
-I'm gonna be on TV.
-Hey, hey! Check out Mr. Big Time.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.275
[groans]

05:18.735 --> 05:20.903
My mouth's clean. It's fine.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.113
[groans]

05:22.196 --> 05:24.699
Better get Mom and Dad's help
turning on the oven.

05:24.782 --> 05:28.244
Don't wanna burn your eyebrows off
before your big debut, champ. [laughs]

05:28.328 --> 05:29.746
Smart. Be right back.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.336
Engage bubble gum.

05:37.754 --> 05:40.965
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:41.049 --> 05:45.428
Black pepper, ground extra fine. [sneezes]

05:46.721 --> 05:49.974
Don't worry about it, Stace.
This is for the old people.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.060
[all cackling]

05:55.104 --> 05:55.938
Clambake!

05:56.773 --> 06:00.651
-Is our family famous yet?
-Ooh, where's my little celebrity?

06:00.985 --> 06:05.406
Sweet seniors playing cards for charity?
Could this be any more adorable?

06:05.490 --> 06:09.118
I just wanna pinch those wrinkled cheeks
and see how far they stretch. Love it.

06:09.202 --> 06:13.081
[laughs]  Well, you wanna see adorable?
Meet my grandson.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.666
He baked cookies for everyone.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.086
Hey, I know that kid!

06:18.169 --> 06:21.589
Yeah! Go, Tim. Go, Mom!

06:21.672 --> 06:24.675
Hi, I'm Cookie Templeton. No, wait!

06:24.926 --> 06:29.138
[Marsha]  Oh, relax, Cookie.
I'm just your average A-list celebrity.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.350
[gasping breaths, sneezing]

06:32.433 --> 06:35.853
-[sneezing continues on TV]
-Scarf that cookie, Estes.

06:36.771 --> 06:39.607
-Bless you! Bless you!
-[sneezing]

06:39.732 --> 06:40.608
Bless you too!

06:40.691 --> 06:43.194
[sneezing continuing]

06:43.277 --> 06:46.781
Whoa, is it allergy season?
What's going around the infirmary here?

06:46.864 --> 06:49.283
[sneezes] My dentures!

06:49.367 --> 06:51.994
Ugh! Roosevelt, something's going down.

06:52.078 --> 06:53.955
Shake the camera
so it looks more exciting.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.085
[old woman]  What's in these cookies?

06:59.168 --> 07:02.130
[Estes]  My dentures!
Where are my dentures?

07:02.213 --> 07:03.965
[Estes sneezing]

07:04.048 --> 07:05.842
Hey, what's happening?

07:07.385 --> 07:10.680
So you baked these cookies yourself.
Hmm.

07:10.763 --> 07:12.348
Roosevelt, smell that news.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.476
I smell bubble gum. Loosens the dentures.

07:15.560 --> 07:18.896
Pepper, makes you sneeze.
And I smell a very big story.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.773
I'm really gonna shake this camera,
Marsha.

07:20.857 --> 07:22.483
Shake it, shake it, shakety-shake.

07:22.775 --> 07:27.447
Templeton, why'd you sabotage the treats?
Age envy? Grampy never hugged you?

07:27.530 --> 07:28.865
What? No! I didn't--

07:28.948 --> 07:31.659
What's the point in making old people
look super gross?

07:31.742 --> 07:33.453
Someone else must've...

07:34.287 --> 07:37.707
You! You're watching, aren't you?

07:37.790 --> 07:41.836
Can-- can he see us?
No, that's crazy, right?

07:41.919 --> 07:43.588
You did this.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.549
What did we do?
Where did we go wrong, son?

07:46.632 --> 07:49.760
Reporting live from the senior center,
I'm Marsha--

07:51.554 --> 07:52.847
Cut! [retches]

07:52.930 --> 07:56.976
Ahh!

07:57.935 --> 07:59.103
[babies laughing]

07:59.479 --> 08:03.357
To poor Estes,
and a very sad day for old people.

08:04.066 --> 08:04.942
[door bangs]

08:05.902 --> 08:09.822
-How could you do that to us?
-Templeton, I did it to Estes.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.533
You made me and our Gigi look terrible.

08:12.617 --> 08:16.329
I'm sorry you were collateral damage,
Templeton, but we had to be proactive.

08:16.412 --> 08:18.789
We can't let old people
cut into our love share.

08:18.873 --> 08:22.210
-Not happening now, am I right?
-Team Baby!

08:22.293 --> 08:26.422
Come on, join us. Field team celebration.
You're part of this.

08:28.132 --> 08:30.676
I did warn you you'd have to pick a side.

08:30.760 --> 08:33.429
You really gonna throw in
with the flying denture crowd?

08:33.513 --> 08:37.058
I'm not picking sides.
I like babies and old people.

08:37.141 --> 08:40.102
I don't want to be part
of your dirty business.

08:40.269 --> 08:45.149
Ha! You can't just walk away from the warm
embrace of Lady Business, Templeton.

08:45.233 --> 08:49.153
You've been out there in the sauce.
She's in your veins now.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.697
It'd be like cutting out your own soul.

08:51.781 --> 08:54.367
Then maybe I'll run my own business.

08:54.450 --> 08:58.704
Oh, really?
And what slapdash operation might this be?

08:58.788 --> 09:02.875
-It’s super cool.
-Your business is called "super cool"?

09:03.042 --> 09:04.627
For big kids.

09:04.961 --> 09:07.129
Super cool big kids?

09:07.213 --> 09:10.925
Incorporated. No sides, no enemies.

09:11.008 --> 09:14.929
Just cool people doing fun stuff,
incorporated style.

09:15.012 --> 09:18.474
-That's not a business.
-You're not a business. Boom!

09:20.142 --> 09:21.310
[line rings]

09:22.562 --> 09:25.773
Mmm. Petrosky residence.
A Petrosky speaking.

09:25.856 --> 09:28.442
Danny, it's Tim.
Are you out of summer school yet?

09:28.526 --> 09:30.653
I decided to home summer school.

09:30.736 --> 09:34.282
Oh, well, I was hoping you could come over
and help me start a business.

09:34.365 --> 09:36.617
Love to, but I'm really swamped.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.579
It's called
Super Cool Big Kids Incorporated.

09:39.662 --> 09:45.001
Yes! Wait, did you say "super cool"?
I'll be there in one!

09:45.084 --> 09:46.711
[babies laughing]

09:48.504 --> 09:53.759
I'm telling you, it was raining dentures.
Estes was, like... [groaning]

09:54.927 --> 09:56.137
-I love that.
-Hey, Double B,

09:56.220 --> 09:59.098
Turtleneck Superstar CEO Baby
wants to see you in her office.

09:59.390 --> 10:00.891
Ah, thanks, Hendershot.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.518
If you'll all excuse me,

10:02.602 --> 10:06.230
I'm off to cleanse myself
in a shower of praise.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.986
[speaks Japanese]

10:12.903 --> 10:14.989
Lots of good news to share.

10:16.115 --> 10:19.118
First and most importantly,
the serum is absolutely secure.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.246
-I guess that isn't so much news as--
-[CEO Baby] Grizzly bears.

10:22.371 --> 10:25.791
-Not where I was going, but...
-When they sleep, do you poke them?

10:26.751 --> 10:28.919
I feel like there's no good answer here.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.881
Frederic Estes. Dangerous? Incredibly.

10:31.964 --> 10:34.008
Ever since you reported him to Baby Corp,

10:34.091 --> 10:36.594
we've had the triplets
on full-time surveillance.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.721
[Triplet 1]  Can you see my brain?

10:38.804 --> 10:41.349
[Triplet 2]  Just empty darkness
and boogers.

10:41.432 --> 10:44.226
[Triplet 3]  I wanna see darkness
and boogers.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.646
-Hey!
-There's about four hours of this.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.147
-But then...
-Give it.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.192
A baby did this!

10:51.567 --> 10:52.443
Uh-oh.

10:52.526 --> 10:54.070
-[sneezes]
-[man shouts]

10:54.153 --> 10:58.699
-Relax, Freddie. Babies are cute.
-I love my grandbabies.

10:58.866 --> 11:00.910
-Do you?
-Yes.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.412
-Do you?
-Yes.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.830
Do you?

11:05.331 --> 11:07.291
Well, now I don't know anymore.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.751
What do babies want?

11:08.834 --> 11:12.338
Mashed food, warm milk, frequent naps,

11:12.421 --> 11:17.510
their family's constant attention,
quality diaper products.

11:17.593 --> 11:19.261
I like all those things.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.931
Exactly. We were here first.

11:22.014 --> 11:26.435
Are we going to let these puking punks
take what's ours? No!

11:26.602 --> 11:29.438
Today we start taking it all back!

11:30.106 --> 11:36.195
Today, we band together
as the Consortium of Ancients.

11:36.278 --> 11:40.908
-[old woman] Oh, yes!
-Let's teach these babies some manners.

11:40.991 --> 11:42.993
[shouting]

11:43.786 --> 11:45.871
You poked a sleeping grizzly bear.

11:45.955 --> 11:49.166
You started a war
with grandmamas and grandpapas.

11:49.250 --> 11:52.086
You'd better be prepared to win it.

11:52.169 --> 11:55.256
Did you see those dentures flying?
We'll annihilate them!

11:55.339 --> 11:57.842
In market share of love.
No actual homicide.

11:58.008 --> 11:59.802
This ends your portion of my time.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.604
I do have a baby grandson
I'm trying to teach some manners.

12:10.729 --> 12:14.150
-Sure, let's give this a try.
- Gigi.

12:15.025 --> 12:16.944
A great sign is important.

12:17.027 --> 12:19.655
It lets the world know
what we're all about.

12:19.864 --> 12:22.908
Being super cool. No boundaries.

12:23.117 --> 12:28.539
I haven't felt this good since my dad
let me eat two whole pies for breakfast.

12:28.622 --> 12:30.499
-[laughs]
-[Boss Baby clears throat]

12:32.126 --> 12:35.254
Excuse me. The baby wants me
to play with him for a second.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.839
[snoring]

12:39.467 --> 12:42.386
Bad news. Gigi's in with Frederic Estes.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.138
Yeah. He's her friend.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.348
Look, I don't have time for enemy stuff.

12:46.432 --> 12:50.019
Danny and I are super busy
just being cool and setting an example

12:50.102 --> 12:52.396
for how everyone else could get along
if they tried.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.316
How is that going to increase
your market share of love?

12:55.399 --> 12:58.277
That's not what
Super Cool Big Kids Incorporated is about.

12:58.360 --> 13:01.197
Your business model is ludicrous!
Sorry, sorry.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.949
Look, I need you to come back
to the field team.

13:04.033 --> 13:08.162
-Babies and old people are at war.
-That bad, huh?

13:08.787 --> 13:11.832
I know Gigi's been really mad
since the cookie thing.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.834
You want me to help fix things
between you guys?

13:13.918 --> 13:15.461
No, I wanna win!

13:15.544 --> 13:17.338
There can be only one.

13:17.421 --> 13:19.924
That's what I thought
when you came into this family.

13:20.007 --> 13:20.841
Guess what.

13:21.050 --> 13:23.260
-Uh...
-I was stupid and wrong.

13:25.804 --> 13:28.641
Boom! Super Cool Big Kid style!

13:29.308 --> 13:31.101
[mockingly] "Super Cool Big Kid Style!"

13:31.227 --> 13:35.064
Turns out Estes isn't
the shriveled pushover we anticipated.

13:35.147 --> 13:39.568
We're in for a dogfight, people.
But these dogs are people, people.

13:39.777 --> 13:43.572
Taking candy from a baby.
Sounds easy, right?

13:43.656 --> 13:46.367
Get that outta your heads!

13:46.450 --> 13:50.454
There's nothing easy
about taking back what's ours.

13:50.538 --> 13:52.706
We're gonna bring out their cranky sides,

13:52.790 --> 13:54.333
show everyone that old people

13:54.416 --> 13:56.919
-are nothing but crotchety grumps.
-[whimpers]

13:57.044 --> 13:59.380
We're going to send them
into tantrum mode.

13:59.463 --> 14:01.549
Parents will go nuts.

14:01.632 --> 14:04.510
The world will run back to babies
for the antidote,

14:04.593 --> 14:07.555
adorable giggles and warm snuggles.

14:07.638 --> 14:11.767
The world's gonna need
a lot of quiet afternoons

14:11.850 --> 14:17.481
and soothing "back in my day" stories
from their elders.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.859
-[Boss Baby] What do we want?
-Babies number one!

14:19.942 --> 14:22.027
-When do we want it?
-Now!

14:22.111 --> 14:23.988
I don't know, I just like yelling!

14:24.071 --> 14:27.783
So hike up those pants
to action mode because...

14:27.867 --> 14:32.204
-babies are going down!
-Oldies are going down!

14:32.288 --> 14:34.039
-Right after our naps.
-Right after our naps.

14:34.123 --> 14:35.708
[all snoring]

14:38.002 --> 14:39.712
-To war!
-To war!

14:40.254 --> 14:42.131
[old man] Hey, stock boy!

14:42.214 --> 14:45.593
What kind of produce section
only has coconuts?

14:46.218 --> 14:49.430
-We must've sold out!
-[Estes] What? We can't mash these!

14:49.513 --> 14:52.349
What do you think we are,
garbage disposals?

14:52.433 --> 14:55.352
[growls]

14:55.436 --> 14:59.398
Please! I have a grandpop.
I like him a lot!

14:59.481 --> 15:04.069
Then you should know
he likes bananas, berries, soft foods!

15:04.153 --> 15:05.070
[whimpering]

15:05.154 --> 15:08.991
Nanners, you fool!
What happened to the nanners?

15:09.241 --> 15:13.412
We must've sold out!
I don't know, who else likes soft food?

15:13.787 --> 15:15.706
Babies.

15:15.915 --> 15:21.670
How is everyone sold out of baby toys?
It's madness. Madness!

15:22.129 --> 15:23.172
[woman gasps]

15:23.255 --> 15:27.217
Hey, she's got a deck of cards. Get her!

15:27.301 --> 15:30.679
Back off! These will give Scooter
two or three minutes of quiet play time,

15:30.763 --> 15:32.222
and they are mine!

15:32.306 --> 15:35.643
What maniac bought all the baby toys?

15:35.726 --> 15:37.019
Old people.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.687
[horn honks]

15:41.398 --> 15:43.067
[giggling]

15:43.943 --> 15:46.862
-Oh, my goodness.
-[gasps, grunts]

15:47.029 --> 15:50.199
[gasps] Where did this adorable
giggly baby come from?

15:50.282 --> 15:52.993
I'm sure your mom or dad
will be here soon.

15:53.077 --> 15:55.913
You're too cute to forget about.

15:56.288 --> 16:00.459
Ugh! Ah, forget it!
I flew planes in the war.

16:00.542 --> 16:03.003
-Let's dance, traffic.
-[horn honks]

16:03.087 --> 16:05.673
-[tires screech]
-Stick a potato in your tailpipe, sonny!

16:08.759 --> 16:10.219
[baby whimpers]

16:14.348 --> 16:15.516
[crying]

16:15.599 --> 16:16.767
[tapping on window]

16:18.978 --> 16:19.812
[baby whimpers]

16:20.854 --> 16:23.524
-[yells]
-[babies crying]

16:23.607 --> 16:27.111
[man] Somebody turn down the volume
of these babies!

16:27.194 --> 16:28.946
-[shouting]
-[man] Shut up!

16:29.029 --> 16:30.572
-[woman yells]
-Huh?

16:30.656 --> 16:32.658
[old people growling]

16:33.200 --> 16:34.827
[Jimbo whimpering]

16:36.286 --> 16:38.998
[tires screeching]

16:40.457 --> 16:42.960
Old people!

16:44.128 --> 16:46.964
[groans] Rough night. Look alive, Peg!

16:47.047 --> 16:49.800
We got a war going on.
Where's that morning market report?

16:49.883 --> 16:52.761
Did we crush old people
right off the pie chart yet?

16:52.845 --> 16:55.389
Hang on, still updating.

16:55.472 --> 17:01.061
Okay, see that teeny, tiny sliver in gray?
That is love for old people.

17:01.395 --> 17:06.066
Ha! Stay off our turf next time,
you dusty skin racks. Sweet victory.

17:06.150 --> 17:09.862
Hang on.
See that teeny, tiny other sliver?

17:10.320 --> 17:12.573
-That's love for babies!
-What?

17:12.823 --> 17:17.953
How? We're supposed to be--
Wait, who's that big piece of pie, then?

17:18.037 --> 17:20.622
Oh, no. No, unh-unh. No.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.500
[yells, babbles]

17:24.001 --> 17:26.253
-It's okay, he's asleep.
-[sighs]

17:26.378 --> 17:28.630
That kid's really going places, isn't he?

17:29.089 --> 17:32.051
-Okay, Templeton, you were right.
-About what?

17:32.217 --> 17:35.512
Babies made old people look bad,
old people made babies look bad,

17:35.596 --> 17:38.015
and somehow... what are you doing?

17:38.098 --> 17:40.684
Making cool sweatbands
out of shirtsleeves for our business.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.895
-There's a market for that?
-We do our own thing.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.814
That's not a business! Sorry, where was I?

17:45.898 --> 17:48.609
Somehow, by doing your own thing,

17:48.692 --> 17:51.612
big kids like you came out
looking better than all of us,

17:51.695 --> 17:53.030
strictly by default.

17:53.113 --> 17:56.283
-Super cool.
-Yes. Super.

17:56.366 --> 17:58.911
Want some business advice?
Make up with old people.

17:58.994 --> 18:02.081
Learn to be friends with Gigi
and you'll feel so much better.

18:02.164 --> 18:03.082
[gasps]

18:03.916 --> 18:08.295
I guess we have no choice.
We have to get our love share back,

18:08.378 --> 18:12.466
even if that means making friends
with the elderly.

18:12.549 --> 18:15.844
-Really? You promise?
-I promise.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.179
Will you help us?

18:17.805 --> 18:18.764
[Boss Baby] Game day!

18:18.847 --> 18:21.767
Game time? Game o'clock?
I never get into sports metaphors.

18:21.850 --> 18:23.102
Tim, progress report.

18:23.185 --> 18:25.104
Gigi put the word out
to the senior center.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.564
Bocce tournament, three p.m. at the park.

18:27.648 --> 18:29.775
Word traveled fast. She's very gossipy.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.860
One of her many winning traits.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.239
And Danny put up hundreds of fliers
for the big baby playdate.

18:35.322 --> 18:37.032
Three p.m. at the park.

18:37.199 --> 18:40.828
Well, that's babies and old people headed
for the same place, same time.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.330
-I hope this works.
-It's a great plan.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.457
You guys just hang out, be super cool,

18:45.541 --> 18:47.668
and I think you'll see
that old people are, too.

18:47.751 --> 18:51.839
Excellent work, Templeton.
Thank you. We'll take it from here.

18:53.173 --> 18:56.927
All clear.
Time to commence Operation Endgame.

18:57.386 --> 19:00.931
[Boss Baby]  Bocce, a game played
with brightly colored balls.

19:01.014 --> 19:04.810
Old people love it,
and they take it very seriously.

19:05.394 --> 19:09.606
Babies. You know what they love?
Brightly colored balls.

19:10.023 --> 19:11.692
Match, meet fuse.

19:11.775 --> 19:13.610
Marsha Krinkle, Channel Eight News.

19:13.861 --> 19:18.073
I'm standing next to a man who once shot
his teeth at me like a mouth cannon.

19:18.157 --> 19:22.369
-So, where's the news coming from today?
-[chuckles] No news.

19:22.452 --> 19:26.623
Just old people enjoying a park
that rightfully belongs to them,

19:26.707 --> 19:30.252
-free from the tyranny of tiny--
-[old woman] Babies!

19:30.335 --> 19:33.088
-[old woman growls]
-[cooing, giggling]

19:33.172 --> 19:34.756
[overlapping exclamations]

19:35.549 --> 19:39.011
-[Staci] That's gonna get ugly.
-Old people yelling at babies?

19:39.094 --> 19:43.056
-"Ugly" doesn't cover the half of it.
-Hands off my bocce ball!

19:43.140 --> 19:45.184
[Boss Baby]
They're gonna look like monsters.

19:45.267 --> 19:47.186
[Gigi] Hand it over, kiddo.

19:47.269 --> 19:50.063
What is with the babies in this town?
No manners, no respect.

19:50.147 --> 19:52.482
-Breaking scandal in Dangerous Well Park.
-Aah!

19:52.566 --> 19:55.861
This cranky coot
is taking a toy away from a baby.

19:55.944 --> 19:58.822
Oh, this isn't what it looks like.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.407
[sobbing]

20:00.532 --> 20:02.326
What is wrong with you?

20:02.576 --> 20:05.412
-I didn't mean to--
-Don't back down, Mrs. Templeton.

20:05.495 --> 20:09.124
These babies need to learn their place,
once and for all.

20:09.208 --> 20:14.004
For justice, for bocce,
and the Consortium of--

20:14.087 --> 20:17.299
Milk and cookies!
Get your milk and cookies.

20:17.507 --> 20:21.428
Free refreshments
from Super Cool Big Kids Incorporated.

20:21.511 --> 20:24.181
What's he doing here?
This isn't part of the plan.

20:24.264 --> 20:25.307
-[Tim] No.
-[all gasp]

20:25.641 --> 20:26.892
It's part of my plan.

20:26.975 --> 20:30.520
I saw you crossing your fingers
in the reflection of Danny's sunglasses.

20:31.605 --> 20:32.856
I promise.

20:34.983 --> 20:37.110
-[Tim] So I'm stopping this myself.
-[gasps]

20:37.194 --> 20:40.864
With one snack
old people and babies can both agree on.

20:40.948 --> 20:43.033
See? You're not so different after all.

20:43.784 --> 20:47.120
-Want some?
-White heaven? Of course I do.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.373
This changes nothing.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.334
Those old people
are still riled up about their bocce.

20:52.417 --> 20:55.629
When the snacks run dry,
it's gonna get ugly.

20:56.296 --> 21:01.093
And you'll still have to choose
which side you're... [gasps]

21:01.802 --> 21:05.097
Templeton! This milk is warm!

21:09.726 --> 21:10.769
[yawns]

21:11.395 --> 21:16.775
-[slurring] How dare you!
-Night-night, baby.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.569
[slow-motion yelling] No!

21:20.112 --> 21:22.990
[Boss Baby snores, groans]

21:24.032 --> 21:24.866
What happened?

21:25.409 --> 21:27.286
-Why is the park our house now?
-Shh.

21:27.369 --> 21:31.081
An incredible scene
of outrageous adorableness today...

21:31.164 --> 21:31.999
No.

21:32.291 --> 21:37.629
...as a group of pudgy babies took
their nappy-nap with these silver seniors.

21:37.921 --> 21:41.216
Wake up, don't look so peaceful!
You're with an old person!

21:41.300 --> 21:44.303
-This can't be happening.
-It already happened.

21:44.386 --> 21:47.139
Timmy, I'm off to protest
a new grocery store opening

21:47.222 --> 21:49.391
at the site of an old grocery store.
Wanna come?

21:49.641 --> 21:51.643
No, thanks. I'm hanging out with the baby.

21:51.727 --> 21:55.480
-[cooing]
-Oh, it's you. Hey.

21:56.940 --> 21:57.983
[Boss Baby grunts]

21:58.233 --> 22:00.485
I know this is weird.
You're both new to each other.

22:00.569 --> 22:03.113
But whatever happens
between babies and old people,

22:03.196 --> 22:04.865
it doesn't come into this house.

22:04.948 --> 22:08.452
Family is a circle.
Nobody should have to pick sides.

22:09.411 --> 22:14.499
Old and young wrapped warmly
in each other's unnatural embrace.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.627
Cute as a koala on a silk pillow.

22:18.128 --> 22:22.966
-Okay. Family's off-limits.
-Pleasure doing business with you.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.052
I think all of us seniors realize

22:25.135 --> 22:27.345
that ain't the way
to raise our grandbabies.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.723
You and me,
we work this out between us.

22:29.806 --> 22:32.517
No more Consortium of Ancients.

22:32.601 --> 22:36.521
Consortium of Ancients forever!

22:36.605 --> 22:40.317
