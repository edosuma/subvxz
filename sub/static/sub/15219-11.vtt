03:56.592 --> 03:58.685

It's my fault.

03:58.761 --> 04:02.458
I should have had the chimneys cleaned
before reopening the house

Julian is dead,

05:20.743 --> 05:23.871
It's terrible and it's unfair,
but that's the way it is, Sis.

05:23.946 --> 05:26.437
I know Julian is dead.

05:26.516 --> 05:30.111
Then why do you believe
he's talking to you?
Because I heard his voice.

Are you sure
it's not the quack's?

05:32.822 --> 05:35.154

And ifTroian goes bonkers
in the process, who cares, right?
She's rich.

07:09.452 --> 07:12.819
She can check into
a nice, private loony bin.

07:12.888 --> 07:15.652

<i>that was so scary</i>
<i>nobody would ever go near it.</i>

<i>you've never succeeded.</i>

Ziggy says this is

09:57.153 --> 10:00.247
have died violent

10:00.322 --> 10:03.814
I don't believe that.

She used to be

by her husband, Julian.

10:28.384 --> 10:31.148
She stopped painting
three years ago...

10:31.220 --> 10:34.383
when the husband...
drowned...

10:34.457 --> 10:36.448
in that lake out there.

10:36.525 --> 10:38.459
The body was never found.

10:38.527 --> 10:40.825

Al, I think I'm...
I think this Dr. Mintz...

10:43.299 --> 10:46.029
might be driving her over the edge
with all this mumbo jumbo.

10:46.101 --> 10:48.399
It's not mumbo jumbo, Sam.

10:48.471 --> 10:51.099
This Tim Mintz
is legit as they come.

10:51.173 --> 10:54.370
Besides, I think
he's crazy about her.

10:54.443 --> 10:57.571
What?
Well, I just came
from the waiting room.

10:57.646 --> 11:00.479
Even though Mintz thinks
he was abducted by aliens,

11:00.549 --> 11:03.484
all he can worry about
is Troian,

11:03.552 --> 11:05.543
and for good reason...

11:05.621 --> 11:08.818
because in two days,
unless you can do something
to prevent it,

11:10.059 --> 11:13.620
she's gonna drown
in the same lake
that her husband did...

he was bored.

14:27.890 --> 14:30.984

17:38.580 --> 17:40.810
Sometimes I wonder.

17:45.687 --> 17:48.815
<i>I'll tell you</i>
<i>what I think, pal.</i>

17:48.891 --> 17:51.553
That lake is so ice cold...

17:51.627 --> 17:55.256
thatJulian needs someone
to cuddle him.

17:55.330 --> 17:57.798
Al!

17:57.866 --> 18:01.324
Well, can you think of
a better explanation for what's
been going on in this place?

18:01.403 --> 18:05.635
<i>Yes. Someone is trying</i>
<i>to drive Troian insane.</i>

18:05.707 --> 18:09.268
- Who?
- [Sighs] I don't know.

18:10.512 --> 18:13.310
My first vote would be
for Miss Stoltz.

18:13.382 --> 18:15.316
What's Ziggy got on her?

18:16.618 --> 18:19.416
Uh... not much.

18:19.488 --> 18:22.286
She's a house... uh, keeper...

18:22.357 --> 18:24.621
that Troian hired
afterJulian died.

18:24.693 --> 18:27.457
She takes care of this fun house.

18:27.529 --> 18:31.329
Sam, wouldn't you like to
take Troian away for a weekend...

18:31.400 --> 18:33.595
<i>to Vegas?</i>

18:33.669 --> 18:35.796
Ah, to save her life.

18:35.871 --> 18:38.499
She's gonna drown
in the black lagoon tomorrow.

18:39.741 --> 18:41.902
I am not gonna let that happen.

18:41.977 --> 18:44.844
Al, if I take her away,
it's just gonna postpone
the inevitable.

18:46.548 --> 18:49.949
The brother...
What do we got on the brother?

18:50.018 --> 18:54.682
Brother. Uh, he majored in golf.
He dabbles in investment.

18:54.756 --> 18:58.055
It's not the brother.
It's not Miss Stoltz.

18:58.126 --> 19:00.356
It's the Claridges
in that mausoleum...

19:00.429 --> 19:04.195
<i>and the three of them</i>
<i>at the bottom of the lake.</i>
Three?

19:04.266 --> 19:07.667
This family
has suffered more drownings
than unwanted kitty cats.

19:07.736 --> 19:09.897
<i>It all started in 1840,</i>

19:09.972 --> 19:12.702
when Nathaniel Claridge
caught his wife, Priscilla,

19:12.774 --> 19:15.709
with the butler in the attic
in flagrante.

19:17.245 --> 19:21.181
He drowned them both in the lake,
and their bodies have never been found.

19:21.249 --> 19:24.047
Al, I don't care
how many Claridges are in the lake.

19:24.119 --> 19:26.610
None of them
are calling out to Troian...

19:26.688 --> 19:29.179
or leaving fish tracks
in the study.

19:30.759 --> 19:35.389
Well, maybe there is
a... a more natural explanation.

19:35.464 --> 19:37.989
Thank you. What?

19:38.066 --> 19:40.534
Troian.

19:40.602 --> 19:43.833
Maybe she's gaslighting herself.

19:43.905 --> 19:46.169
Why?

19:47.309 --> 19:51.109
I don't know.
My money's still on the ghost.

19:53.815 --> 19:55.976
You know, Al,

19:56.051 --> 20:01.387
this ghost-hunting equipment that
Dr. Mintz has placed around the estate,
it's not bad for '71.

No, here it is.

20:15.637 --> 20:18.697

20:21.810 --> 20:23.744
Uh...
That one.

20:23.812 --> 20:25.803
Well, I'm-I'm not sure
about that.

20:25.881 --> 20:28.975
It resembles a voice pattern,
but, um,

20:29.051 --> 20:32.043
there's something weird about it.

20:32.120 --> 20:35.419
Yeah, right.
That was made by a ghost.

20:35.490 --> 20:38.948
It was not made by a ghost.
There is no such things as ghosts.
That was a ghost.

20:39.027 --> 20:41.723
- If you tell me...
- <i>Damn you, Mintz!</i>

20:41.797 --> 20:43.924

32:54.395 --> 32:57.853
Julian,
I'm taking your silence...

32:57.932 --> 32:59.866
as good-bye.

33:13.981 --> 33:18.213
<i>[Ghostly Voice]</i>
<i>Troian.</i>

33:55.623 --> 33:58.786
It's working.
Of course it's working.

33:58.860 --> 34:01.920
It's picking up a transmission...
a battery transmission
in the tomb.

34:01.996 --> 34:04.931
<i>[Dog Howling]</i>

34:04.999 --> 34:09.663
Ah-ha.
[Laughing]

34:09.737 --> 34:12.228
I think we found it, Al.
[Machinery Clicking]

34:12.306 --> 34:14.603
Whoo!

34:14.675 --> 34:18.577
Oh. This is a fresh one.
1948?

34:20.414 --> 34:23.781
Well, it could still have...

34:23.851 --> 34:26.445
yucky stuff.

34:32.360 --> 34:35.329
<i>[Hammer Tapping]</i>
Geez, Sam.

34:36.397 --> 34:40.333
<i>[Dog Howling]</i>

34:46.040 --> 34:49.032
Ah, look at this!
Do I have to?

34:49.110 --> 34:52.909
Here's your ghost.
Aah! Oh, Sam. Ha, ha, ha.
Don't do that.

34:56.951 --> 34:59.419
<i>That's a very quiet ghost.</i>

34:59.487 --> 35:02.979
I can hear the tape hiss.
Thank God for disks.

35:05.293 --> 35:10.128
<i>[Dog Howling]</i>

35:16.604 --> 35:19.835
<i>Troian.</i>

35:23.711 --> 35:26.703
Would it be possible
to record a voice...

35:26.781 --> 35:30.774
only to be heard by ears
sensitive to high frequencies?

35:30.851 --> 35:33.843
<i>[Dog Howling]</i>
You mean, like dogs?

35:33.921 --> 35:38.620
Yeah, and some people,
usually women.

35:38.693 --> 35:42.527
Be tricky. Would take
an electronic genius.
Yeah, I know.

35:44.131 --> 35:48.534
Sam, this thing
is remote-controlled
and gang-loaded.

35:48.602 --> 35:53.266
If there were any other recorders
around, you might have started
them too when you started...

35:53.341 --> 35:55.502
Sam? Sam! Wait!

35:55.576 --> 35:57.942
I can locate Troian. Sa...

36:01.849 --> 36:05.376
Gooshie? Have Ziggy
center me on Troian.

36:06.754 --> 36:08.745
Troian?

36:10.958 --> 36:12.949
Troian.

36:15.396 --> 36:19.457
<i>Troian.</i>

36:22.303 --> 36:24.294
Troian?

36:27.641 --> 36:31.668
<i>[Dog Howling]</i>
[Sighs]

36:36.851 --> 36:38.910
<i>Oh, God!</i>

36:49.363 --> 36:53.459
What? I don't wanna hear about
"we can't get a lock."

36:53.534 --> 36:57.265
You tell Ziggy if he doesn't
center me on Troian right now,

36:57.338 --> 37:00.068
I'm going to feed
his sex-sensory microchips...

37:00.141 --> 37:02.268
to Tina's crocodile!

37:02.343 --> 37:05.471
<i>[Dog Howling]</i>

<i>You must know that.</i>

37:26.634 --> 37:29.125
<i>[Dog Howling]</i>

37:29.203 --> 37:32.934
Do I have to join you
to prove it?

37:33.007 --> 37:34.998
[Whispers]
No.

37:36.043 --> 37:37.977
Then what <i>do</i> you want?

37:38.045 --> 37:42.243
I want you to live.

37:42.316 --> 37:47.253
But the painting...
why are we together
under the lake?

37:47.321 --> 37:49.687
<i>Because that's where</i>
<i>I need you, Sis.</i>

37:49.757 --> 37:53.921
I really thought I could quietly
drive you to the funny farm,
but I see that's not gonna happen.

37:53.994 --> 37:57.191
<i>You see, I got this I.O.U.</i>
<i>to these bad dudes in Vegas.</i>

37:57.264 --> 38:02.133
And now I gotta kill my sister.
Talk about your bad days.

38:02.203 --> 38:04.967
Stop it!
<i>I wish I could.</i>

38:05.039 --> 38:07.166
Fiscal year's ending,

38:07.241 --> 38:10.836
and when you find out
how much of your bread I've spent,
you're really gonna flip.

38:10.911 --> 38:15.644
You'll revoke my power of attorney,
start running things your way <i>again.</i>

38:15.716 --> 38:18.879
- You're insane.
- Not technically.

38:18.953 --> 38:22.719
See, I know the difference
between right and wrong.

38:22.790 --> 38:25.054
<i>I just choose wrong.</i>

38:25.126 --> 38:27.822
Now, why don't you
do us both a favor
and step off the dock?

38:27.895 --> 38:29.829
Jimmy!
Julian's waiting.

38:29.897 --> 38:32.661
[Whispering]
No, he's not.

38:32.733 --> 38:36.032
- How did you do that?
- <i>She didn't.</i>

38:36.103 --> 38:40.437
Oh, doing a little yin yang on me?

<i>[Water Splashing]</i>
Jimmy, let me help you.

38:53.287 --> 38:55.187
Sure, Sis. Jump.

38:55.256 --> 38:57.520
Jimmy.
<i>[Dog Howling]</i>

Jimmy.

39:09.570 --> 39:11.561
No!

Spook games are over.

39:15.809 --> 39:17.743
Jimmy.

39:17.811 --> 39:21.941
- You gonna jump,
or do I have to push you?
- Jimmy!

39:22.016 --> 39:25.543
I'm not gonna die forJulian,
and I'm damn well not gonna die for you.

39:25.619 --> 39:27.644
I'm gonna hate this.

Jimmy. Stop!

Run. Run, baby, run!

40:54.375 --> 40:58.175
[Gasps, Coughing]

40:59.813 --> 41:02.714
Unbelievable.
Look at these clothes.

41:02.783 --> 41:06.617
I think you'll find
this is Nathaniel Claridge's wife,

41:06.687 --> 41:09.087
and this is his butler.

41:09.156 --> 41:12.057
He drowned them
over 131 years ago.

41:13.894 --> 41:17.660
I don't know
if I can handle this, Tim.

41:17.731 --> 41:19.858
Yes, you can.

41:19.933 --> 41:22.663
My brother tried
to drive me insane.

41:22.736 --> 41:25.569
He wanted to kill me.
How can I live with that?

41:25.639 --> 41:29.598
He was sick, Troian.
Very sick.

41:29.677 --> 41:32.669
I know it's no excuse,
but that's what you
have to remember.

41:34.281 --> 41:36.272
I want to.

41:38.052 --> 41:40.452
You survived
Julian's death...

41:40.521 --> 41:43.581
and all the horrors
thatJimmy put you through.

41:43.657 --> 41:47.650
You'll survive this too.
That's the difference
between you and your brother.

41:47.728 --> 41:50.253
You're a survivor.

41:50.331 --> 41:54.825
There's, uh, no sign of your brother,
Mrs. Claridge. I'm sorry.

41:54.902 --> 41:57.393
He drowned trying to save you,
did he?

42:00.040 --> 42:02.338
Yes.

42:02.409 --> 42:04.343
Who are the bodies?

42:04.411 --> 42:09.405
Well, sir, I believe that one of'em
is Mrs. Claridge's husband.

42:11.785 --> 42:14.276
Julian?
No, no. No.

42:14.355 --> 42:17.552
Look, he... he drowned
over three years ago.

42:17.624 --> 42:21.185
Well, Mrs. Little says
the other two bodies have been
down there over a hundred years.

42:21.261 --> 42:25.391
<i>This lake is deep.</i>
<i>The temperature at the bottom</i>
<i>must be around freezing.</i>

42:25.466 --> 42:28.731
They look better than some
I've seen fresh dead.

42:28.802 --> 42:31.771
- Why would they come up now?
- The quake.

42:31.839 --> 42:34.000
Must have shook 'em free.

42:34.074 --> 42:37.703
I'm sorry, ma'am, but I'm gonna have to
ask you to identify your husband.

42:47.388 --> 42:49.379
I'm scared, Tim.

42:51.692 --> 42:53.683
I'm here.

42:56.964 --> 42:58.955
Yes, you are.

I can do...

No. You've all been very kind.

If you'd like to come up,
I'll have my housekeeper,
Miss Stoltz,

44:03.230 --> 44:05.221
put on some hot tea
and coffee.

44:05.299 --> 44:08.325
Miss Stoltz.
Yes. Do you know her?

44:08.402 --> 44:11.303
No, but it's quite a coincidence.

44:11.371 --> 44:14.670
Uh, Nathaniel's wife, Priscilla,
was a Stoltz.

44:14.741 --> 44:19.405
Yes, um, a Mennonite, I believe,
from Pennsylvania.

44:41.668 --> 44:43.659
[Gasps]

44:53.180 --> 44:57.207

You two look like
