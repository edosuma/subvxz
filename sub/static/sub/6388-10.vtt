00:00.250 --> 00:02.250
Previously
on <i>Californication...</i>

00:02.304 --> 00:03.905
What do you do
in the real world?

00:03.939 --> 00:05.973
I traverse the globe
in the company of musicians.

00:06.008 --> 00:07.808
- You're a groupie.
- Muse...

00:07.843 --> 00:09.610
Would really be more
applicable.

00:09.645 --> 00:11.279
Men have written songs
about me.

00:11.346 --> 00:13.447
I can see why.
Do you want to get high?

00:13.482 --> 00:14.582
Does the Pope shit
in the woods?

00:14.616 --> 00:16.584
Have anything
to roll with?

00:16.618 --> 00:18.085
They don't call it
"The Good Book" for nothing.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.754
I feel so bad.

00:19.788 --> 00:22.089
- I need to hit the road, love.
- This is fate.

00:22.124 --> 00:23.925
Tiny talked about you
all the time.

00:23.959 --> 00:26.661
He said that you had
an uncanny ability

00:26.695 --> 00:28.229
to suck killer riffs
out of him.

00:28.263 --> 00:29.897
I will have you know, Hank,

00:29.932 --> 00:31.465
that I was a very good
little Catholic schoolgirl.

00:31.500 --> 00:33.234
Are you trying
to turn me on?

00:33.268 --> 00:35.403
My parents, they hit me
pretty hard once upon a time.

00:35.437 --> 00:37.138
I'm still smarting.

00:37.172 --> 00:38.932
I played at this stupid
little church social.

00:38.941 --> 00:40.574
Of course, all my mom
had to say was

00:40.609 --> 00:42.143
that I looked like
a slut up there.

00:42.177 --> 00:43.611
Methinks you like
this one, Faith.

00:43.645 --> 00:45.980
She likes him.
I can tell.

00:46.014 --> 00:47.934
You seem to have
a real connection with this one.

00:47.950 --> 00:48.950
It could be a real thing.

00:48.984 --> 00:50.184
I have big news.

00:50.218 --> 00:54.288
Tonight I am making love
to a woman.

00:54.323 --> 00:57.325
Karen, this is bullshit.
He poops on people.

00:57.359 --> 00:59.393
That woman is amazing.

01:03.699 --> 01:06.334
Okay, so the reason I've
summoned you both to dinner--

01:06.368 --> 01:08.636
- Oh, God!
- I have news.

01:08.670 --> 01:10.137
Jesus Christ.

01:10.172 --> 01:11.906
Why do you go there
so quickly?

01:11.940 --> 01:13.708
Because it's never
good news with her.

01:13.742 --> 01:16.310
It's always disgusting,
stomach-churning awful.

01:16.345 --> 01:17.712
She's bad-news Becca.

01:17.746 --> 01:19.146
Could you at least
let her speak first?

01:19.214 --> 01:21.849
Please. I'm sorry.
Go ahead.

01:21.883 --> 01:23.651
- So I've decided--
- To go back to school!

01:23.685 --> 01:25.519
That is awesome.
Shut up!

01:25.554 --> 01:27.421
Of course you have.
Up high.

01:27.456 --> 01:29.290
Someone. Anyone.

01:29.324 --> 01:32.159
I've decided
to go abroad

01:32.194 --> 01:34.028
for an indeterminate
amount of time.

01:34.062 --> 01:35.363
- Wow.
- Why?

01:35.397 --> 01:36.797
I hate L.A.

01:36.832 --> 01:38.065
Okay, word.
I'm with you on that.

01:38.100 --> 01:40.368
But go back to school,
graduate,

01:40.402 --> 01:41.869
and then you can go abroad.

01:41.903 --> 01:43.004
I want to make
a literary pilgrimage.

01:43.038 --> 01:44.505
I want to follow
in the footsteps

01:44.539 --> 01:46.140
of my favorite
expatriate writers...

01:46.174 --> 01:47.375
- I love that.
- Burroughs,

01:47.409 --> 01:48.976
Paul Bowles,
Henry Miller.

01:49.011 --> 01:50.211
Sweetie, that's wonderful.

01:50.245 --> 01:51.545
Going on
a literary pilgrimage

01:51.580 --> 01:52.847
does not make you
a writer.

01:52.881 --> 01:54.315
The only thing
that makes you a writer

01:54.349 --> 01:56.050
is gluing your ass
in a seat

01:56.084 --> 01:57.885
and getting
what's inside your head

01:57.919 --> 01:59.253
out on the paper.

01:59.287 --> 02:00.654
Everything else is a pose.

02:00.689 --> 02:03.591
You can expat yourself
on the back

02:03.625 --> 02:05.893
and go "pilgrimate"
after you've done something,

02:05.927 --> 02:09.229
after you're had some success.
Why can't I do both?

02:09.264 --> 02:11.932
It just seems
so romantic.

02:11.967 --> 02:13.167
That's just it, Becca.

02:13.201 --> 02:15.369
You know, things
that seem romantic

02:15.404 --> 02:17.772
very rarely are.
Ain't that the truth.

02:17.774 --> 02:19.507
Oh, don't get all loaded
with me, woman.

02:19.541 --> 02:22.176
- Another good talk.
- No, sweetie--

02:22.210 --> 02:24.378
Becca, I love the idea.

02:24.413 --> 02:26.013
- You know...
- Ugh!

02:26.048 --> 02:27.748
I think we can get through
all this muck and mire

02:27.783 --> 02:29.617
if we just gave in
to our baser instincts

02:29.651 --> 02:32.553
and engaged in a little
therapeutic hate-fucking.

02:32.587 --> 02:34.455
Okay, fine.

02:34.489 --> 02:36.791
You know, I'm not sure I'd be
into it even if you were.

02:36.825 --> 02:38.893
You know why? Because
you're sullied...and shit.

02:38.927 --> 02:40.928
- You love that shit.
- No, no, you're just--

02:40.962 --> 02:44.899
you're all soiled...
And shit.

02:44.933 --> 02:47.635
Sullied...Shit.

- Hi.

03:50.749 --> 03:52.316
How are you?

03:52.350 --> 03:54.351
- How's it going?
- Is this a bad time?

03:54.386 --> 03:57.021
No, of course not.
This is Beckett.

03:57.055 --> 03:58.556
This is Hank Moody.

03:58.623 --> 04:01.025
He's a writer and a drinker.
Thank you.

04:01.059 --> 04:04.361
He's working on that musical
with your brother.

04:04.396 --> 04:05.863

Or give him a titty twister.

04:14.406 --> 04:15.773
Don't I know it.

04:15.807 --> 04:17.841
Beckett just got
off the road.

04:17.875 --> 04:20.244
Yeah, Faith's been kind enough
to house-sit for me

04:20.278 --> 04:22.112
while I've been gone.
Ah.

04:22.147 --> 04:24.915
And what is my reward?
I get kicked to the curb.

04:24.950 --> 04:27.952
Come on.
I met a model in Australia,

04:27.986 --> 04:30.421
so she's moving in.
Who knows?

04:30.455 --> 04:31.956
She might even be
the one.

04:31.990 --> 04:34.425
Oh, baby,
good luck with that.

04:34.459 --> 04:36.260
Well, I got to try, right?
You got to keep trying.

04:36.294 --> 04:37.661
You do?

04:37.696 --> 04:39.129
It's not as if
you're ever gonna

04:39.164 --> 04:40.264
let me make an honest groupie
out of you.

04:40.298 --> 04:41.298
Well, you never asked, so...

04:41.333 --> 04:42.633
Hey, does Atticus know

04:42.667 --> 04:44.868
about this special
little friendship?

04:44.903 --> 04:46.403
- Fuck, no.
- Oh, God, no.

04:46.438 --> 04:47.871
It would absolutely
destroy him.

04:47.906 --> 04:49.273
His head would explode.
Which would fuck up

04:49.307 --> 04:50.975

I don't need

05:27.345 --> 05:29.146
Okay, well,
then I will retract it,

05:29.180 --> 05:32.149

hide nor hair of it ever again.

05:41.026 --> 05:43.994
Yes, I do.
And I like it that way.

- Here's your beers.
- Thank you, sir.

05:46.731 --> 05:48.699
Things just have a way
of working out.

05:48.733 --> 05:51.168
And men have been
especially kind to me.

05:51.202 --> 05:54.171
Understandably so.
But what is next?

05:54.205 --> 05:55.606
I'm not sure yet.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.474
I think we should
keep drinking,

05:57.509 --> 05:59.376
and something will eventually
suggest itself.

05:59.411 --> 06:02.079
That's what my mom
always used to say.

06:02.147 --> 06:03.947
You can crash at Charlie's
if you need to.

06:03.982 --> 06:06.950
But where would I sleep?

06:17.228 --> 06:20.464
What?

06:20.498 --> 06:21.999
Telemarketers?

06:22.033 --> 06:24.668
Worse--my mother.
She's a bit of a cunt.

06:24.703 --> 06:28.038
Scratch that--she takes the warm
and fuzzy out of "cunt."

06:28.073 --> 06:30.174
Ooh, I like that.
And I'm gonna steal that.

06:30.208 --> 06:32.910
Fair warning--
one day I will use that.

06:32.944 --> 06:34.311
Oh, be my guest.

06:34.346 --> 06:36.413
I guarantee you
she wants me to come home.

06:36.448 --> 06:38.215
Moms are good like that.
Yep.

06:38.249 --> 06:43.320
Well, when I do,
it's always a fucking disaster.

06:43.355 --> 06:45.689
She doesn't exactly approve
of the lifestyle.

06:45.724 --> 06:47.224
Moms are good
like that too.

06:47.258 --> 06:49.693
How long's it been?
Fuck if I know, dude.

06:49.728 --> 06:51.595
I've been with the circus
a while.

06:51.629 --> 06:53.664

it's been a spell.

sow some of her wilder oats,

06:57.736 --> 06:59.203
you should go visit 'em.

06:59.237 --> 07:03.607
What's the harm?
Just throw 'em a bone.

07:03.641 --> 07:07.344
Okay.
I'll go if you go.

07:07.412 --> 07:09.713
- What?
- Come on.

07:09.748 --> 07:11.582
It'll be super awesome
bringing home

07:11.616 --> 07:13.417
a relatively normal
boyfriend type.

Thank you.
Gee, thanks.

you are as sick as they come,

07:17.756 --> 07:19.356
but you're a little bit better
at passing for normal.

Hey.
Oh, look at you.

and the long, filthy hair?

09:05.063 --> 09:07.798
Oh, I-I-I left those
in the car.

09:07.832 --> 09:09.900

a good impression.

09:09.934 --> 09:12.336

in a religious supply store.

Oh, well, that's why
I'm such a slut.

- Jack, guess what.

09:31.589 --> 09:34.391
Faith's here.

09:34.425 --> 09:39.363

What else would he be doing?

09:41.299 --> 09:43.867
Jesus Christ!
What are you doing?

09:43.902 --> 09:46.470
- What?
- You're watching nasty movies?

09:46.504 --> 09:48.972
Oh, the hell I am. I was just
switching through the channels,

09:49.007 --> 09:50.574
and this one caught my eye.

09:50.608 --> 09:52.409
Of course it did,
because it's naked women.

09:52.443 --> 09:54.378
I'm surprised you're not
touching yourself.

09:54.412 --> 09:55.846
Well, who else is
going to?

09:55.880 --> 09:57.881
Will you watch your mouth?
Faith is here.

09:57.916 --> 10:00.784
What?
Why didn't you tell me?

10:00.818 --> 10:03.654
Turn that off
before she gets in here!

10:03.688 --> 10:05.389
Faith.

10:05.423 --> 10:07.024
Dad.

10:07.058 --> 10:09.760
Hi. Ahh.

10:09.794 --> 10:12.229
Who's this clown?

10:12.263 --> 10:14.398
Hank Moody, sir.
Nice to meet you.

10:14.432 --> 10:15.933
Where's the tattoo
and long hair?

10:15.967 --> 10:18.035
It would appear
you have a type, young lady.

10:18.069 --> 10:19.570
- Well...
- You staying for dinner?

10:19.604 --> 10:21.805
Why not?

10:21.839 --> 10:23.440
Hey, do me a favor.

10:23.474 --> 10:25.208
Will you run to the liquor store
and get me some booze?

10:25.243 --> 10:26.910
Your mother refuses
to buy it for me.

10:26.945 --> 10:28.612
She--she thinks
I drink too much.

10:28.646 --> 10:30.080
She's probably right, Dad.

10:30.114 --> 10:31.415
Well, wouldn't you?

10:31.449 --> 10:33.417
Hey, you like to drink?

10:33.451 --> 10:34.751
Does the Pope shit
in the woods?

10:34.786 --> 10:36.453
You better watch it, pal.

10:36.487 --> 10:38.455
That woman will burn you
at the stake

10:38.489 --> 10:39.556
for talking like that.

10:42.460 --> 10:46.229
♪

10:51.369 --> 10:54.338
What was that for?
No, no, don't tell me.

10:54.372 --> 10:57.074
Just--just do it again.

10:57.108 --> 11:00.544
Okay, now,
what was that for?

11:00.578 --> 11:02.913
For encouraging me
to come.

11:02.947 --> 11:04.748
Oh, I always encourage women
to come.

11:04.782 --> 11:07.651
It--it does not always happen,
but I like to think

11:07.685 --> 11:09.620
that I'm at least
encouraging.

11:09.654 --> 11:13.590
- Classy.
- Is that...?

11:13.658 --> 11:18.395
Faith?
Is that you?

11:18.463 --> 11:20.597
Oh, my God, it is you.

11:20.632 --> 11:23.166
Holy shit.
You look fucking amazing!

11:23.201 --> 11:25.702
- Thanks. You too.
- Shannon.

11:25.737 --> 11:27.037
Shannon Mitchell.

11:27.071 --> 11:29.773
No, of course.
Shannon--hi. Hi.

11:29.807 --> 11:31.508
I look like a fucking
fat pig.

11:31.542 --> 11:33.010
That's probably why
you don't even recognize me.

11:33.044 --> 11:35.512
Oh, stop, stop.
This is amazing.

11:35.546 --> 11:37.514
You're first?
Pbbbt. I wish, dude.

11:37.548 --> 11:39.316
My third.
Wow.

11:39.350 --> 11:40.884
Who's that guy?
Is that your husband?

11:40.918 --> 11:42.119
- No. No, no, no.
- God, no.

11:42.153 --> 11:44.888
Fiance.
Charles Wolfgang Runkle.

11:44.922 --> 11:46.890
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

11:46.924 --> 11:49.192
Congrats.

11:49.227 --> 11:50.827
- Thank you.
- This is so weird.

11:50.862 --> 11:53.063
I never thought
you'd have a fiance.

11:53.097 --> 11:55.232
I heard you were, like,
out there slutting around,

11:55.266 --> 11:56.700
like, fucking a bunch
of rock dudes.

11:56.734 --> 11:59.336
Somebody said they saw you
in a music video,

11:59.370 --> 12:01.338
or, like, on a sex tape
or something.

12:01.372 --> 12:03.040
Well, what's
the difference, really?

12:03.074 --> 12:05.142
Don't believe everything
you hear.

12:05.176 --> 12:06.376
This girl right here--

12:06.411 --> 12:08.445
she used to be quiet
as a mouse.

12:08.513 --> 12:10.647
Always had her face buried
in some book.

12:10.682 --> 12:12.783
And then one day
she exploded.

12:12.817 --> 12:15.419
She got super hot
and fucked everyone.

12:15.453 --> 12:17.521
- Oh, good for you, honey.
- Okay. All right, all right.

12:17.555 --> 12:19.322
That's not entirely true.

12:19.357 --> 12:21.725
She fucked my husband, even.

12:21.759 --> 12:24.528
- Really? Did I?
- Yeah. Larry Walters.

12:24.562 --> 12:26.530
Remember, you fucked
Larry Walters?

12:26.564 --> 12:29.332
- Larry Walters.
- I--vaguely, yeah.

12:29.367 --> 12:31.735
He played guitar for Mysstery,
two "s"s.

12:31.769 --> 12:33.537
Well, he sure remembers you.
Guitar player.

12:33.571 --> 12:36.540
Larry.
Dude, get your ass over here.

12:36.574 --> 12:38.675
It's Faith
from American Martyrs.

12:38.710 --> 12:41.244
Oh, Faith.
Holy shit!

12:41.279 --> 12:44.081
Larry...
Looking good. Hey.

12:44.115 --> 12:45.415
- This is so awesome.
- Hey.

12:45.450 --> 12:46.850
So fucking abso--
it just is.

12:46.884 --> 12:48.185
Sir, don't forget
your change.

12:48.219 --> 12:49.853
How's your mom and dad,
Faith?

12:49.887 --> 12:51.354
I bet they're
so happy to see you,

12:51.389 --> 12:53.390
'cause you never
come home, ever.

12:53.424 --> 12:55.192
I see your mom
in target sometimes,

12:55.226 --> 12:57.227
and she tries to tell everyone
that you ran off

12:57.261 --> 13:00.063
and joined the Peace Corps,
which is funny,

13:00.098 --> 13:01.698
'cause we all know that you,
like, just hopped

13:01.733 --> 13:04.401
on a rock-and-roll tour bus
and never looked back.

13:04.435 --> 13:06.436
I guess maybe she's still
kind of embarrassed

13:06.471 --> 13:08.105
about all that stuff that--
yeah, well, you know...

13:08.139 --> 13:09.573
- What--what happened?
- It's--it's not--

13:09.607 --> 13:11.141
it's another story
for another day.

13:11.175 --> 13:12.209
Oh, well, then...

13:12.243 --> 13:13.577
We should get together...

13:13.611 --> 13:15.145
Grab a drink.

13:15.179 --> 13:17.581
- Yeah, we totally should.
- We totally should.

13:17.615 --> 13:19.416
You probably shouldn't
be drinking in your condition.

13:19.450 --> 13:22.152
Pbbbt. Come on,
spritzers don't hurt--

13:22.186 --> 13:24.221
little puff of weed
every now and then.

13:24.255 --> 13:26.223
They try to tell you
it hurts the baby.

13:26.257 --> 13:27.424
It don't.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.593
I think cletus the fetus
in there

13:29.627 --> 13:30.994
might disagree with you.

13:31.028 --> 13:34.064
He's fine.
He's seen a lot.

13:34.098 --> 13:36.266
- Ow. Ow! Oh.
- What? What?

13:36.300 --> 13:37.667
Ooh. Look at that.

13:37.702 --> 13:40.170
Oh, look at that, honey.
I should probably--

13:40.204 --> 13:41.638
we should take this together.
- Oh, we should.

13:41.672 --> 13:42.753
We should probably
get this.

13:42.774 --> 13:44.307
Your phone's not ringing.

13:44.342 --> 13:46.109
I have it on silent.
You didn't hear that?

13:46.144 --> 13:47.705
Yeah, but there's nothing
on the screen.

13:47.712 --> 13:49.146
- It's on vibrate.
- Yeah, but I can tell

13:49.180 --> 13:50.914
you're shaking your phone
right now.

13:50.948 --> 13:53.116
Well, guess what.
I have bell's palsy.

13:53.151 --> 13:54.751
- Sorry.
- Oh, it's--it's fine.

13:54.819 --> 13:56.119
Great seeing you.
Bye, Larry.

13:56.154 --> 13:57.621
Yeah, you too.
See you soon, hopefully.

13:57.655 --> 14:00.290
Stop staring,
you fat fuck.

14:00.324 --> 14:01.658
I totally fucked her.

14:01.692 --> 14:04.161
Mom, thank you.
This looks amazing.

14:04.195 --> 14:06.496
Oh, who wants
to say grace?

14:06.531 --> 14:08.331
Oh, uh, hey, why don't
we just take a break

14:08.366 --> 14:10.867
from mumbling over our food
before we eat?

14:10.902 --> 14:12.202
What do you think, guys?

14:12.236 --> 14:13.970
What is this?
You've got an audience?

14:14.005 --> 14:15.438
What, you're showing off?

14:15.473 --> 14:17.707
You know something?
I grew up in a house

14:17.742 --> 14:19.609
where we closed our eyes
and mumbled almost every meal.

14:19.644 --> 14:21.545
I'm--I'm--
I'm good with it.

14:21.579 --> 14:23.046
Come on, Dad.

14:23.080 --> 14:25.315
Bless us, oh, Lord,
for these, thy gifts,

14:25.349 --> 14:27.517
for which we are about
to receive

14:27.552 --> 14:29.853
from thy bounty,
through Christ, our Lord.

14:29.887 --> 14:30.987
- Amen.
- Amen.

14:31.022 --> 14:32.155
- Pass the--
- and...And...

14:32.190 --> 14:36.193
Dear Lord,
thank you so much

14:36.260 --> 14:40.130
for bringing our daughter Faith
home to us

14:40.164 --> 14:42.165
and watching over her
while she's been out whoring

14:42.200 --> 14:44.334
with the devil's children

14:44.368 --> 14:47.070
and protecting her
and keeping her from harm

14:47.104 --> 14:51.241
and keeping her from
sexually transmitted diseases.

14:51.275 --> 14:52.715
- Ooh.
- Through Jesus' name we pray.

14:52.743 --> 14:54.377
- Amen.
- Amen.

14:54.412 --> 14:56.880
So...that happened.

14:56.914 --> 14:58.582
Yeah.

14:58.616 --> 15:00.150
So how did you two meet?

15:00.184 --> 15:01.885
Oh, it's a really
funny story, actually.

15:01.919 --> 15:04.821
It's actually the cutest
of meets.

15:04.856 --> 15:08.725
I wasn't feeling very well
about myself at the time,

15:08.759 --> 15:10.894
and I ended up at, um...

15:10.928 --> 15:13.063
What, a church?

15:13.097 --> 15:14.564
It's a church-like place.

15:14.599 --> 15:16.533
I mean, they talked a lot
about God there.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.002
- They did.
- Anyway, there she was.

15:19.036 --> 15:20.237
And, uh...

15:20.271 --> 15:21.905
I was feeling
pretty lousy myself.

15:21.939 --> 15:24.374
- Yeah.
- Oh, Faith, I'm so glad

15:24.408 --> 15:26.843
you're still talking to him.
Yeah, me too.

15:26.878 --> 15:28.845
- Okay...
- So this one over here

15:28.913 --> 15:31.014
was pretty annoying.
Oh, I was annoying?

15:31.048 --> 15:33.016
Really, he was--

15:33.050 --> 15:34.718
He went out of his way,
really.

15:34.752 --> 15:37.053
We got to talking, and
we actually--we actually bonded

15:37.088 --> 15:38.722
over a page
of the old testament.

15:38.756 --> 15:40.857
How wonderful.

15:40.925 --> 15:43.927
Faith certainly knows her Bible
backwards and forwards.

15:43.929 --> 15:46.730
- She inhales her Bible.
- All true.

15:46.764 --> 15:48.925
She made me feel a lot better
about myself at the time,

15:48.933 --> 15:50.901
and we've been hanging out
ever since.

15:50.935 --> 15:53.270
Well, that is
a very nice story.

15:53.304 --> 15:56.239
Does this mean you're turning
over a new leaf, sweetheart?

15:56.274 --> 15:58.642
What
what does that mean?

15:58.676 --> 16:01.111
Well, it sounds like you're
no longer degrading yourself

16:01.145 --> 16:03.613
by hanging out
with those perverted musicians

16:03.648 --> 16:05.282
all the time.
Okay...

16:05.316 --> 16:06.883
Well, you know, some
of those perverted musicians

16:06.951 --> 16:08.585
have written songs
about her.

16:08.619 --> 16:10.654
Well, sure, after she sucked
their filthy penises.

16:10.688 --> 16:13.056
- All right--
- come on, oh...

16:13.090 --> 16:14.970
Mom, why do you just assume
that they're filthy?

16:14.992 --> 16:16.993
And what's so bad about
a blow job between friends?

16:17.028 --> 16:18.795
You know, men love it
when you suck their dicks.

16:18.829 --> 16:21.932
It makes them so happy, mom.
Amen!

16:21.966 --> 16:23.767
Amen, huh?

16:23.801 --> 16:26.102
What?
Watch yourself.

16:26.137 --> 16:28.672
Hey, I agree with
Mrs. Faith's mom on this one.

16:28.706 --> 16:30.640
I-I find penises
unilaterally disgusting.

16:30.675 --> 16:33.276
Can we, uh, talk about
something other than penises--

16:33.311 --> 16:36.346
I mean, filthy or otherwise?
You like sports?

16:36.380 --> 16:39.416
Sadly, I am not--I know you're
gonna deduct points for that.

16:39.450 --> 16:42.919
My apologies. But I'm
a huge fan of your daughter.

16:42.987 --> 16:44.487
I think she's amazing.

16:44.522 --> 16:46.489
And I think you two
should be very proud.

16:46.524 --> 16:47.524
I'll drink to that.

16:47.558 --> 16:49.292
We were very, very proud

16:49.327 --> 16:52.128
when she dedicated her life
to him and--

16:52.163 --> 16:54.431
- Who?
- Him.

16:54.465 --> 16:58.401
Oh, him. That guy.
Of course. Of course.

16:58.436 --> 17:01.204
What-what did that entail?
Can we just not?

17:01.238 --> 17:04.874
But then
she abandoned him

17:04.909 --> 17:06.810
and kind of humiliated
our family.

17:06.844 --> 17:09.679
I don't really know how many
times I can say I'm sorry, Mom.

17:09.714 --> 17:11.714
- Green beans?
- Please.

17:11.749 --> 17:13.049
He forgives
all of his children.

17:13.084 --> 17:14.351
Good. Good to know.

17:14.417 --> 17:16.720
Unfortunately,
I have not.

17:16.753 --> 17:18.188
There it is.
Shocker.

17:18.222 --> 17:20.790
- Roll?
- No.

17:20.825 --> 17:22.058
In spite of your limitations

17:22.093 --> 17:23.560
and you're mean-spirited
bullshit,

17:23.594 --> 17:25.362
I love you--I forgive you.
You forgive me?

17:25.396 --> 17:26.863
God damn it!

17:26.896 --> 17:28.330
She didn't want to become
a fucking nun!

17:28.366 --> 17:29.966
I mean,
what's wrong with that?

17:30.034 --> 17:31.501
How can you blame her?

17:31.535 --> 17:33.236
What kind of life is that
for someone?

17:33.270 --> 17:36.806
Excuse me.

17:36.841 --> 17:40.076
Mary...

17:40.111 --> 17:41.411
- Thanks, Dad.
- Jesus.

17:41.445 --> 17:43.880
"Thanks, dad"?
Thanks for what?

17:43.914 --> 17:46.850
Why do you got to get her
all worked up over this?

17:46.884 --> 17:48.752
You know, you know
this is gonna happen.

17:48.786 --> 17:50.687
You don't come and visit,
and when you do,

17:50.721 --> 17:53.890
we--we always end up talking
about the same thing.

17:53.924 --> 17:55.658
Why can't we just
have dinner

17:55.693 --> 17:58.862
and talk about--I don't know--
the fucking weather?

18:08.906 --> 18:10.874
You were a nun?

18:10.908 --> 18:12.575
Kind of gross, huh?

18:12.610 --> 18:14.277
Well, it would be
if you were one of those

18:14.311 --> 18:16.379
wrinkly old war horses,
but you're not.

18:16.414 --> 18:18.381
So it's kind of hot.

18:18.416 --> 18:20.917
Well, I know it was
a little extreme,

18:20.951 --> 18:25.422
but I have been looking
for something...

18:25.489 --> 18:27.891
bigger than myself
my whole life.

18:27.925 --> 18:30.927
And for a while,
it was really nice.

18:30.961 --> 18:33.997
But I just couldn't live
that way.

18:34.031 --> 18:35.565
Oh, I understand.

18:35.599 --> 18:39.969
The nunnery's loss
is humanity's gain.

18:40.004 --> 18:43.139
The sisters caught me
getting off once,

18:43.174 --> 18:46.576
which was hugely,
hugely embarrassing.

18:46.610 --> 18:48.011
- Uh-huh.
- But...

18:48.045 --> 18:49.612
They told you not to
make a habit of it.

18:51.348 --> 18:56.286
The funny thing is,
I'm still looking, searching.

18:56.320 --> 18:58.321
I still believe.

18:58.355 --> 19:00.290
It's all connected somehow,

19:00.324 --> 19:02.492
even sex and God
and rock and roll.

19:02.526 --> 19:05.829
Well, believe it or not,
I have this recurring dream

19:05.863 --> 19:07.130
about church and a nun.

19:07.164 --> 19:08.598
- Really?
- Yeah.

19:08.632 --> 19:10.667
And what typically happens
in such a dream?

19:10.701 --> 19:12.769
Typically, I come in
filled with angst.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.003
Mmhmm.

19:14.038 --> 19:15.338
And I want have
a conversation

19:15.372 --> 19:17.474
with the guy
up on the wall there.

19:17.508 --> 19:21.144
And then this nun shows up.
She's very pleasant...

19:21.178 --> 19:23.513
Very agreeable.
And how does it end?

19:23.547 --> 19:25.615
In a very blasphemous manner.

19:25.649 --> 19:27.150
Hmm.

19:45.503 --> 19:48.771
Uh...eyes up here, you.

19:50.374 --> 19:54.344
Who says dreams
don't come true?

19:57.214 --> 20:00.316
Faith?
Hey, do me a favor.

20:00.351 --> 20:02.619
Go apologize
to your mother, will you?

20:02.653 --> 20:04.854
She's been crying and praying
ever since you left.

20:04.889 --> 20:07.157
- Come on.
- Please?

20:07.191 --> 20:08.631
I know she's
out of her fucking mind,

20:08.659 --> 20:09.993
but she's still
your mother.

20:10.027 --> 20:14.297
All right.
All right.

20:14.331 --> 20:17.700
Hey, Hank,
grab a seat.

20:20.437 --> 20:22.939
Want a beer?
Don't mind if I do.

20:23.007 --> 20:24.574
Here you go.

20:24.608 --> 20:26.509
You got kids?

20:26.544 --> 20:28.378
Yeah, one daughter,

20:28.412 --> 20:31.080
from a previous
romantic entanglement.

20:31.115 --> 20:33.049
Oh, yeah, daughters are
the fucking worst.

20:33.083 --> 20:35.018
Tell me about it.

20:35.052 --> 20:37.320
I got two.

20:37.354 --> 20:39.556
One's gonna end up
just like her mother,

20:39.590 --> 20:41.090
and the other one
looking for God

20:41.125 --> 20:42.525
in the back of a tour bus.

20:42.560 --> 20:44.227
Is that really how you feel
about her?

20:44.261 --> 20:46.362
'Cause if you do,
then I feel sorry for you.

20:46.397 --> 20:50.033
Well, then
feel sorry for me.

20:50.067 --> 20:51.868
I don't really know her
anymore.

20:51.902 --> 20:53.336
You should get to know her.

20:53.370 --> 20:54.771
She's pretty great.

20:54.805 --> 20:56.105
I think you'd be surprised.

20:56.140 --> 21:00.043
You know,
I never told her this,

21:00.077 --> 21:02.946
but I was so happy when she got
into all that Jesus stuff.

21:02.980 --> 21:04.714
You know, as a father, you--

21:04.748 --> 21:06.749
you know, you worry about
all those dirtbags out there.

21:06.784 --> 21:09.052
And I just thought,
"well, she'll be safe."

21:09.086 --> 21:12.455
Yeah, that's--that's generally
how I feel about my daughter.

21:12.489 --> 21:15.391
In fact, I-I secretly hope
that she's a lesbian.

21:15.459 --> 21:17.060
It's not very secret.

21:17.094 --> 21:19.395
I say it every chance
I get, actually.

21:19.463 --> 21:21.464
You're a weird fucking guy,
you know that?

21:21.498 --> 21:24.067
Pretty much, yeah.

21:26.737 --> 21:30.039
If I had it to do
all over again,

21:30.074 --> 21:32.442
I'd encourage
her every fucking whim.

21:32.476 --> 21:34.944
I'd say yes
instead of no.

21:34.979 --> 21:37.046
I'd laugh
instead of yell.

21:37.081 --> 21:38.815
This house was
too fucking strict.

21:38.849 --> 21:41.084
She must have felt like
a rat in a cage.

21:41.118 --> 21:45.054
Between me and her mother,
she couldn't do anything right.

21:45.089 --> 21:48.224
People do strange things when
they're judged all the time,

21:48.259 --> 21:51.094
instead of just being loved.

21:51.128 --> 21:54.097
Cheers.

22:03.474 --> 22:05.075
I'm still shocked
you haven't turned this

22:05.109 --> 22:06.809
into a sewing room
or something.

22:06.844 --> 22:10.446
Too many memories of
the little girl I used to know.

22:10.514 --> 22:12.815
It's all I have left.

22:12.850 --> 22:14.651
Don't be so dramatic,
please.

22:14.685 --> 22:19.122
Look, I'm sorry...

22:19.156 --> 22:22.325
I'm sorry too.

22:22.359 --> 22:23.960
There were a lot
of nasty things

22:23.994 --> 22:25.962
that just came flying
out of my mouth.

22:25.996 --> 22:27.630
I-I don't know why
I always do that.

22:27.665 --> 22:30.333
Old habits, I guess.

22:30.367 --> 22:32.168
We would just like
to see you more often.

22:32.202 --> 22:35.138
Oh, can you just be happy
that I'm here right now?

22:35.172 --> 22:36.673
I know. I know.

22:36.707 --> 22:38.308
It's just that we may not be
around forever,

22:38.342 --> 22:39.509
and your father
really misses you.

22:39.543 --> 22:41.010
Is he okay?

22:41.045 --> 22:42.779
Well, he's a raging alcoholic

22:42.813 --> 22:44.847
on the highway to hell,
but other than that,

22:44.882 --> 22:46.416
yeah, he's fine.

22:46.450 --> 22:50.853
And you? Are you trying
to tell me something?

22:50.888 --> 22:54.490
- Oh, what a beautiful cross.
- Thanks.

22:54.558 --> 22:56.893
It was a present
from a really special guy.

22:56.927 --> 23:00.029
Of course.
There's always a guy.

23:00.064 --> 23:02.065
- Mmm.
- I'm sorry to interrupt,

23:02.099 --> 23:06.336
but your father started watching
soft-core pornography again.

23:06.370 --> 23:07.737
I got uncomfortable.

23:07.771 --> 23:10.039
What a poor, lost soul.
Okay.

23:10.074 --> 23:12.842
Well, I guess
you two are--whoa--tired

23:12.876 --> 23:14.977
and maybe a little drunk.

23:15.012 --> 23:17.747
I can smell it on both of you.
It's kind of hideous.

23:17.781 --> 23:19.349
Good night, honey.
Good night.

23:19.383 --> 23:21.684
- Okay.
- Good night.

23:21.719 --> 23:24.187
Oh, no. You are going
to the couch.

23:24.221 --> 23:25.788
- Oh, come on.
- No.

23:25.823 --> 23:28.191
Do I see a ring on that finger?
Are you married?

23:28.225 --> 23:31.594
Otherwise, you're not gonna
sleep together in that bed,

23:31.628 --> 23:33.262
not under this roof.
