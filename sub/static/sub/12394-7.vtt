04:08.310 --> 04:10.403

MAMAAAAA!

08:41.620 --> 08:43.645
MAN, YOU JUST GOT KNOCKED THE--
- WOW. REALLY, SHAWN?

08:43.690 --> 08:46.579
- WE WANNA BE USED.
HOW CAN WE HELP?

08:46.620 --> 08:50.920
- OH. YEAH. Y'ALL KNOW
WHERE WE CAN GET SOME SUPPLIES?

08:50.960 --> 08:52.825
- I BELIEVE WE DO.

08:52.860 --> 08:54.999
- THEN RIGHT AFI'ER THAT,
WE SPENT THREE MONTHS

08:55.030 --> 08:57.123
IN THE AMAZON RAIN FOREST.

08:57.170 --> 08:58.990
- AMAZON.
RAIN FOREST.

08:59.030 --> 09:01.032
- TRUE, DAT.

09:01.070 --> 09:02.799
HEY, THE GUSTER!

09:02.840 --> 09:04.205
[laughter]

09:04.240 --> 09:06.333
WE WERE TEACHING THE NATIVES
HOW TO COMPOST.

09:06.370 --> 09:07.803
- IN HINDSIGHT,

09:07.840 --> 09:09.307
I THINK ALL THEY REALLY
WANTED WAS FOOD.

09:09.340 --> 09:12.571
- WHY WOULD YOU SAY THAT, CARL?
- WELL, THEY WERE HUNGRY.

09:16.220 --> 09:17.949
- PSST.

09:17.990 --> 09:20.311
[whispers]
COME HERE, COME HERE.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.180
WHAT YA GOT?
- HERE.

09:24.360 --> 09:27.158
- OH, YEAH, SOME ROPE.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.668
AH! BINOCULARS.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.622
YES, WALKIES!

09:31.670 --> 09:34.138
YES, BINOCULARS, WALKIES,
HEMP ROPE.

09:34.170 --> 09:35.262
- IS THERE BY CHANCE
A HEMP RIFLE IN THERE?

09:35.300 --> 09:38.030
LET'S NOT FORGET THE ARMED PART
OF ARMED AND DANGEROUS.

09:38.070 --> 09:39.879
- OR THE JOHN CANDY PART.

09:39.910 --> 09:41.036
- SHAWN, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
RIGHT NOW?

09:41.080 --> 09:42.229
- EATING A FRUIT ROLL-UP.

09:42.280 --> 09:44.999
- LOOK, GUYS,
WE'RE GONNA SPLIT UP.

09:45.050 --> 09:46.847
USE THE WALKIES
TO COMMUNICATE.

09:46.880 --> 09:49.178
SHAWN, I WANT Y'ALL
TO GO UP HIGH.

09:49.220 --> 09:50.642
LOOK OUT FOR ANYTHING,

09:50.690 --> 09:52.681
ANYTHING IN ORDER
TO GIVE YOU A CLUE

09:52.720 --> 09:54.358
AS TO THESE CONVICTS'
WHEREABOUTS,

09:54.390 --> 09:56.779
LIKE PASSENGERS
ACTING FUNNY OR SCARED

09:56.830 --> 09:58.183
OR BLACKED-OUT WINDOWS--
ANYTHING.

09:58.230 --> 09:59.993
- GOT IT.

10:00.030 --> 10:01.657
- WHERE YOU GONNA BE?

10:01.700 --> 10:03.622
- ONCE Y'ALL RADIO ME
THE CONVICTS' LOCATION,

10:03.670 --> 10:05.228
I'M GONNA ISOLATE THEM
FROM THE CIVILIANS.

10:05.270 --> 10:07.192
THAT'S WHEN I'M GONNA
MAKE MY MOVE.

10:07.240 --> 10:08.036
- BY YOURSELF?

10:08.070 --> 10:10.106
- I GOT THE LORD
ON MY SIDE, BROTHER.

10:10.140 --> 10:12.301
- I ADMIRE YOUR FAITH.
- OH, YEAH.

10:12.340 --> 10:14.103
LET'S BOUNCE.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.617
- [whispers]
THERE THEY ARE.

10:23.720 --> 10:26.689
- UH, CRAIG, YOU THERE?

10:26.720 --> 10:28.711
- YOU REALIZE YOU'RE USING
YOUR RADIO VOICE?

10:28.760 --> 10:30.421
NOT TO BE CONFUSED
WITH YOUR CELL PHONE VOICE

10:30.460 --> 10:33.054
OR YOUR WHITE DUDE VOICE.
- I DO NOT HAVE A RADIO VOICE.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.295
- WHO IS THIS?
- GUS.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.298
- THIS DON'T SOUND LIKE YOU.

10:37.330 --> 10:39.389
YOU USING SOME KIND OF
RADIO VOICE OR SOMETHING, MAN?

10:39.430 --> 10:43.036
- LISTEN. WE HAVE A VISUAL
ON THE SUSPECT S.

10:43.070 --> 10:45.129
THEY'RE SNEAKING ONTO
THE LIFEBOAT.

10:45.170 --> 10:47.206
- I'M ON IT. 10-4.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.400
- [quietly]
COOL.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.186
- DAMN!

11:03.230 --> 11:05.118
SHAWN, GUS, THEY SEALED OFF
ALL THE DOORS

11:05.160 --> 11:06.855
TO THE OUTER DECK.

11:06.900 --> 11:08.891
- DAMN. OKAY.
WE'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

11:08.930 --> 11:11.125
- YOU READY?

11:11.170 --> 11:13.263
- Y--WH--

11:13.300 --> 11:16.235
- HEY, IF I'M GONNA DIE,
YOU'D BE'I'I'ER BE RIGHT BEHIND ME,

11:16.270 --> 11:20.172
OR I WILL HAUNT YOUR KITCHEN
CABINETS TILL THE DAY YOU DIE.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.115
[clang]

11:34.160 --> 11:35.957
both: SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH!

11:43.830 --> 11:45.297
- GET THE HELL OU'I'I'A HERE.

11:53.140 --> 11:54.368
NO!

11:54.410 --> 11:56.173
- HOW IS THAT POSSIBLY
A GOOD IDEA?

11:56.210 --> 11:57.472
- SORRY, PRISON DUDES.

11:57.510 --> 11:59.501
WE SIMPLY COULD NOT
LET YOU TAKE THAT LIFEBOAT.

11:59.550 --> 12:01.370
NOW YOU HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO STAY HERE

12:01.420 --> 12:03.240
AND WAIT FOR THE POLICE
TO TAKE YOU IN.

12:03.290 --> 12:05.747
- ACTUALLY,
THERE IS ANOTHER CHOICE.

12:08.320 --> 12:10.880
[telephone rings]

12:10.930 --> 12:11.885
- LASSITER.

12:11.930 --> 12:13.192
- TELL MY DAD

12:13.230 --> 12:16.222
I KIND OF TOOK MATTERS
INTO MY OWN HANDS.

12:25.140 --> 12:27.404
- OKAY, MR. NORTHCUTI',
THERE'S A WAY THIS PLAYS OUT

12:27.440 --> 12:30.102
WHERE NO ONE, INCLUDING YOU
OR YOUR FELLOW INMATES,

12:30.150 --> 12:31.549
GETS HURT.

12:31.580 --> 12:33.275
BUT FIRST AND FOREMOST,
WE NEED CONFIRMATION

12:33.320 --> 12:35.208
THAT THE HOSTAGES ARE SAFE.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.411
- WELL, THEY ARE.

12:37.450 --> 12:41.079
BUT IF YOU WANT THEM
TO STAY THAT WAY,

12:41.120 --> 12:43.953
THEN YOU PROVIDE US
WITH A FULLY FUELED BOAT,

12:43.990 --> 12:46.026
A GPS DESCRAMBLER,

12:46.060 --> 12:47.994
AND ASSURE US...

12:48.030 --> 12:50.225
THAT NO ONE'S GONNA FOLLOW US.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.158
CALL ME BACK
WHEN WE'VE GOT A DEAL.

12:52.200 --> 12:53.792
[click]

12:53.840 --> 12:56.161
- O'HARA, DO WE HAVE
THAT INTEL YET?

12:56.200 --> 12:57.565
- "DANE NORTHCUTI'.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.339
"SAN FUS SANDERS,
ADAM GEORGE,

12:59.370 --> 13:00.974
GABRIEL APPEL."

13:01.010 --> 13:02.034
EACH HAS A MULTIPAGE RAP SHEET.

13:02.080 --> 13:05.106
CRIMES RANGE FROM GRAND LARCENY
TO ARMED ROBBERY.

13:05.150 --> 13:07.038
THEY'VE BEEN MODEL PRISONERS
UP UNTIL NOW.

13:07.080 --> 13:09.412
THIS WORK FURLOUGH
WAS A REWARD FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR.

13:09.450 --> 13:12.146
- THEY'RE CURRENTLY ARMED
AND CONSIDERED VERY DANGEROUS.

13:12.190 --> 13:13.885
- THEY ALL ORCHESTRATED

13:13.920 --> 13:15.808
BEING ON WORK DETAIL
AT THE SAME TIME.

13:15.860 --> 13:17.987
I'M WILLING TO BET
THIS WAS THEIR PLAN ALL ALONG.

13:18.030 --> 13:19.486
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE,

13:19.530 --> 13:21.259
BUT I DO KNOW THIS MUCH--

13:21.300 --> 13:23.120
IT WAS THAT JACKASS
SPENCER'S FAULT.

13:23.170 --> 13:24.865
- LASSITER, NOT REALLY
HELPFUL RIGHT NOW.

13:24.900 --> 13:26.322
- CARLTON, I'M SURE THAT
WHATEVER SHAWN DID

13:26.370 --> 13:28.497
IT WAS BECAUSE HE FELT
HE HAD NO CHOICE.

13:28.540 --> 13:31.168
- CHOICE 17--YOU COULD HAVE
LET THEM GET IN THE BOAT

13:31.210 --> 13:32.609
AND LEFI' YOUR PHONE NEAR
TO TRACK IT.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.039
- CHOICE 18.

13:34.080 --> 13:36.173
YOU COULD HAVE SAT YOUR
MARK ASS DOWN SOMEWHERE

13:36.210 --> 13:37.609
AND LET ME HANDLE IT.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.847
- CHOICE 19--WE COULD HAVE
GOT IN THE BOAT AND GOT AWAY!

13:40.880 --> 13:45.340
- EVERYONE EMPTY THEIR POCKETS
INTO THIS BAG.

13:45.390 --> 13:47.415
- HEY, MAN.
- COME ON, GIVE IT UP.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.212
- HEY, DUDE, DUDE.
- WHAT?

13:49.260 --> 13:51.888
- WHY DON'T YOU LET
THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN

13:51.930 --> 13:53.591
AND MEN GO?

13:53.630 --> 13:55.598
- WHY DON'T YOU SHUT UP?
- ALL RIGHT.

13:55.630 --> 13:58.064
- COME ON, GIVE IT UP.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.898
COME ON, GIVE IT UP!

14:00.940 --> 14:02.362
- [whispers]
WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING

14:02.400 --> 14:04.163
TO LET THEM KNOW
THEY CAN TRUST US.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.007
GIVE THEM THE NOD.

14:06.040 --> 14:07.075
- SHAWN, THE NOD WORKS

14:07.110 --> 14:08.930
WHEN IT'S ME GIVING IT
TO A BROTHER

14:08.980 --> 14:10.004
BEHIND THE COUNTER
AT JAMBA JUICE,

14:10.050 --> 14:11.540
NOT AN ARMED CONVICT.
- TCH!

14:13.080 --> 14:15.014
WE GOTI'A CREATE
AN UNEXPECTED EMERGENCY,

14:15.050 --> 14:17.541
ONE THEY AIN'T GONNA
BE ABLE TO HANDLE.

14:17.590 --> 14:18.614
THEN, WE'LL THROW 'EM OFF,

14:18.650 --> 14:21.255
AND WE CAN EXPLOIT THAT
TO BREAK DOWN THEIR UNITY.

14:21.290 --> 14:23.326
- WHAT KIND OF EMERGENCY?
- I GOT AN IDEA.

14:23.360 --> 14:26.557
- DOES IT INVOLVE A BEAR?

14:26.590 --> 14:28.228
I'VE GOT A BETTER IDEA.

14:28.260 --> 14:29.966
[rip]
_ WH--

14:30.000 --> 14:30.967
[rip]
SHAWN!

14:32.940 --> 14:36.068
- SORRY.
- [groans]

14:36.100 --> 14:37.909
MM...

14:37.940 --> 14:38.907
MOMMY.

14:38.940 --> 14:40.032
- HELP!

14:40.080 --> 14:42.105
SOMEBODY! SOMEBODY HELP!
- YO, YO!

14:42.140 --> 14:43.676
MAN DOWN, MAN DOWN!

14:43.710 --> 14:45.246
HEY, HEY.
- WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

14:45.280 --> 14:48.215
- Y'ALL TWO GOTI'A DO SOMETHING,
OR DUDE IS GONNA DIE.

14:48.250 --> 14:50.081
- STAY WITH US, GUS.
HANG IN THERE, BUDDY.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.315
- WE LOSIN' HIM!
WE LOSIN' HIM, MAN!

14:52.350 --> 14:54.955
HEY, IF HOSTAGES
START DROPPIN' UP IN HERE,

14:54.990 --> 14:56.287
COPS GONNA BE
ALL OVER THIS PIECE!

14:56.320 --> 14:57.287
- YOU TWO PICK HIM UP.

14:57.330 --> 14:59.958
- WHAT THE HELL ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO WITH HIM?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.126
- YEAH, MAN.
WE AIN'T NO DOCTORS.

15:01.160 --> 15:04.129
- HE'S JUST SEASICK,
YOU FREAKIN' IDIOTS.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.468
JUST GET HIM O_U'|'|'A HERE.
- [groaning]

15:06.500 --> 15:07.637
- DON'T WORRY, GUS.

15:07.670 --> 15:11.003
HERE. HERE'S ANOTHER PATCH.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.667
OKAY, WORRY A LITTLE.

15:14.040 --> 15:16.201
- UP, UP.

15:25.220 --> 15:27.950
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

15:27.990 --> 15:29.719
IT'S TAKEN THE COPS
WAY TOO LONG TO RESPOND.

15:29.760 --> 15:31.079
- YEAH, WAY TOO LONG.

15:31.130 --> 15:33.951
- WHAT'S THE ETA
ON THE SNIPERS?

15:36.230 --> 15:38.164
- THEY'RE ALMOST IN POSITION.

15:38.200 --> 15:40.168
- YEAH, WELL, "ALMOST"
ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

15:45.540 --> 15:48.031
- [whispers] THAT'S IT.
THEY'RE STARTING TO BREAK.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.174
THIS IS MY CHANCE
TO CONVINCE THEM TO LET US GO.

15:51.210 --> 15:53.144
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN.

15:53.180 --> 15:55.171
YOU GOTTA COME
AT THESE GUYS HARD

15:55.220 --> 15:57.188
IF YOU WANT THEM
TO RESPECT YOU, OKAY?

15:57.220 --> 16:01.213
NO SILLINESS.
NO RANDOM MOVIE REFERENCES.

16:01.260 --> 16:04.024
- THIS IS JUST LIKE
COLLATERAL.

16:04.060 --> 16:06.153
EXCEPT I'M JAMIE FOXX
AND YOU'RE TOM CRUISE.

16:06.190 --> 16:07.726
YOU'RE CRUISE.

16:07.760 --> 16:09.625
- YOU FINISHED?

16:09.660 --> 16:10.763
- OH, YEAH, MAN.
- YOU SURE?

16:10.800 --> 16:13.030
YOU SURE, 'CAUSE IF YOU'RE NOT--
- I'M DONE, I PROMISE.

16:13.070 --> 16:14.469
- NO, 'CAUSE YOU SEEM TO THINK
I AIN'T GOT NOTHING ELSE

16:14.500 --> 16:16.559
BETTER TO DO WITH MY TIME.
- WE'RE IN THIS THING TOGETHER.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.261
PLEASE.
FINISH WHAT YOU WERE SAYING.

16:20.210 --> 16:23.771
- WELL, ONE WAY FOR YOU
TO COME OFF HARD...

16:23.810 --> 16:26.005
TAKE THE LAST THING THEY SAID,

16:26.050 --> 16:28.018
AND THEN YOU REPEAT IT
BACK TO THEM.

16:28.050 --> 16:29.745
YOU KNOW,
LIKE A ANGRY QUESTION.

16:29.780 --> 16:32.112
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE
ANY SENSE.

16:32.150 --> 16:34.186
- THAT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE?

16:34.220 --> 16:35.756
- OH, I STAND CORRECTED.

16:35.790 --> 16:37.326
- OH, YOU STAND CORRECTED!
- OKAY, I GOT IT.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.657
- YOU SURE?
- YEAH, YEAH.

16:38.690 --> 16:40.328
- 'CAUSE IT'S SUBTLE.
YOU WANNA PRACTICE?

16:40.360 --> 16:42.294
- IT'S NOT SUBTLE.
I GOT IT.

16:42.330 --> 16:44.161
- THE TWO OF YOU
NEED TO SHUT UP RIGHT NOW.

16:44.200 --> 16:45.599
I DON'T WANNA SHOOT YOU.

16:45.630 --> 16:47.495
- OH, YOU DON'T WANNA
SHOOT US?

16:47.540 --> 16:49.064
YOU DON'T WANNA SHOOT US?

16:49.100 --> 16:51.807
MAN, HOW DARE YOU SAY,
"YOU DON'T WANNA SHOOT US"?

16:51.840 --> 16:54.172
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, MAN.
JUST CALM DOWN.

16:54.210 --> 16:56.030
NOW...

17:01.720 --> 17:03.187
- OH...

17:03.220 --> 17:06.747
- WE TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP.

17:06.790 --> 17:07.882
- YO.

17:07.920 --> 17:10.559
WE JUST SAW THE COPS LOADING UP
TWO BOATS WITH SNIPERS.

17:10.590 --> 17:12.182
- DAMN IT!

17:12.230 --> 17:14.596
- OHH...UHH...

17:14.630 --> 17:16.359
- YOU SAID IF WE WENT ALONG
WITH YOU,

17:16.400 --> 17:18.061
IT'D ALL BE SMOOTH.

17:18.100 --> 17:20.694
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT NO SNIPERS.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.163
- YEAH, MAN, HE'S RIGHT.
I AIN'T TRYING TO DIE.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.734
LOOK, MAN, YOU AIN'T
THE ONLY ONE WITH A DIME PIECE

17:24.770 --> 17:26.101
WAITIN' FOR HIM OUT THERE.

17:26.140 --> 17:27.778
- YOU THINK
I WANTED THIS TO HAPPEN?

17:27.810 --> 17:30.301
- HEY. PRISON DUDE.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.102
COPS AREN'T PLAYING AROUND,
OKAY?

17:32.150 --> 17:35.142
I THINK IT'S TIME
YOU RETHINK YOUR PLAN.

17:35.180 --> 17:36.272
I'M SURE THEY'D BE WILLING
TO MAKE A DEAL

17:36.320 --> 17:38.288
IF YOU SHOW 'EM
SOME GOOD FAITH,

17:38.320 --> 17:40.356
A GESTURE, YOU KNOW?

17:40.390 --> 17:42.187
LIKE THAT ALL THE HOSTAGES
ARE SAFE.

17:42.220 --> 17:44.154
THAT'S ALL THEY CARE ABOUT
IN THESE SITUATIONS.

17:44.190 --> 17:46.181
DIDN'T YOU SEE DOG DAY?

17:46.230 --> 17:47.629
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:47.660 --> 17:51.460
YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

17:51.500 --> 17:54.799
- CHOICE 21--
YOU COULD HAVE USED HYPNOSIS

17:54.840 --> 17:56.398
TO CONVINCE HIM
TO LET US ALL GO.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.408
- GUS, I WAS HOPING
HE WOULD RELEASE THE HOSTAGES,

17:58.440 --> 18:01.204
NOT USE US
AS A HUMAN SHIELD.

18:01.240 --> 18:02.229
- THIS IS VICK.

18:02.280 --> 18:04.578
WE'RE STILL WORKING
ON GETTING YOU THAT BOAT.

18:04.610 --> 18:06.578
- NICE TRY, BUT IT'S TOO LATE.

18:06.610 --> 18:08.544
YOU CALL OFF YOUR SNIPERS
RIGHT NOW.

18:08.580 --> 18:11.811
YOU'LL SEE THEY HAVE
NO CLEAR SHOTS.

18:13.190 --> 18:15.158
- DAMN IT.
THEY'RE ALL IN THE WAY.

18:15.190 --> 18:18.853
- OKAY, MR. NORTHCUTT.
LET'S JUST REMAIN CALM.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.450
THERE IS AN EASIER WAY OUT
IF YOU JUST SURRENDER NOW.

18:21.500 --> 18:23.127
- YOU LISTEN TO ME!

18:23.170 --> 18:25.764
IF WE'RE NOT PROVIDED THAT BOAT
IN TEN MINUTES,

18:25.800 --> 18:27.836
I'M GONNA START KILLING
YOUR HOSTAGES.

18:27.870 --> 18:29.132
YOU GOT THAT?

18:29.170 --> 18:29.932
[click]

18:29.970 --> 18:31.699
- CHIEF, WE HAVE TO LISTEN
TO THEM.

18:31.740 --> 18:33.207
TWO OF OUR OWN
ARE ON BOARD.

18:33.240 --> 18:35.834
- WELL, 1 1/2 AT BEST.
- STILL NOT HELPFUL.

18:35.880 --> 18:36.778
- COME ON, HENRY,
YOU AND I BOTH KNOW

18:36.810 --> 18:38.402
WE HAVE A STRICT POLICY
OF NONNEGOTIATING

18:38.450 --> 18:39.701
IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS.

18:39.750 --> 18:41.513
CHIEF, MAKE THE CALL.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.289
- WE'RE GOIN' IN.

18:45.320 --> 18:48.312
- THE BOYS ARE GOIN' HARD!

19:03.570 --> 19:04.707
- GO.
- GO!

19:04.740 --> 19:06.230
- OH, COME ON, MAN, PLEASE.
- SHUT UP!

19:06.270 --> 19:07.635
- I VOTED FOR OBAMA!

19:07.680 --> 19:09.932
- SHUT UP! MOVE!
- COME ON!

19:09.980 --> 19:12.244
JUST TAKE KYLE!
- GO! GO! GO!

19:12.280 --> 19:14.612
SHUT UP!

19:18.450 --> 19:20.452
[two gunshots]

19:20.490 --> 19:21.809
[passengers cry out]

19:21.860 --> 19:24.522
[sniffling, crying]

19:28.000 --> 19:30.389
passengers: OH!

19:30.430 --> 19:33.934
[commotion]

19:44.980 --> 19:46.948
[overlapping yelling]

19:51.950 --> 19:55.488
- BOYS! PUT THIS ON!

19:55.520 --> 19:57.385
WHERE'S ALL THE INMATES?
- YOU HAVE TO GO DOWN.

19:57.430 --> 19:58.988
YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH
THE DOOR AND DOWN.

19:59.030 --> 20:01.225
- I GOT FOUR!
FOUR PRISONERS ON THIS BOAT.

20:01.260 --> 20:03.262
I GOT FOUR PRISONERS.

20:16.680 --> 20:17.874
- I THINK WE GOT 'EM!

20:17.910 --> 20:19.946
- NO!

20:19.980 --> 20:21.618
LASSIE, NO!

20:21.650 --> 20:23.288
THOSE TWO AREN'T PRISONERS!

20:23.320 --> 20:24.582
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

20:30.760 --> 20:32.955
- THEY'RE NOT PRISONERS!

20:32.990 --> 20:35.629
- WHO ARE THEY?
- UM...

20:35.660 --> 20:38.823
- D.C. AND C.C.?

20:47.540 --> 20:48.609
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN UP.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.949
BY THE TIME WE CAUGHT UP
WITH THE STOLEN MEDIC BOAT,

20:50.980 --> 20:54.040
NORTHCUTT AND SANDERS
HAD ALREADY MADE THEIR ESCAPE.

20:54.080 --> 20:56.947
THE HUNT IS NOW
AN INTERAGENCY TOP PRIORITY,

20:56.980 --> 20:58.845
SO WE ARE
COORDINATING EVERYTHING

20:58.890 --> 21:01.415
WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT
AS WELL AS THE COAST GUARD.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.826
YOUR PERSONAL ASSIGNMENTS
HAVE BEEN SENT TO YOUR INBOXES.

21:03.860 --> 21:05.487
- CHIEF, ANYTHING
ON NORTHCUTT OR SANDERS

21:05.530 --> 21:07.054
OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT
OF CORRECTIONS

21:07.090 --> 21:09.456
THAT CAN HELP US ON THIS?

21:10.700 --> 21:13.021
- I'VE GOT SOMETHING, CHIEF.

21:13.070 --> 21:15.994
I'M SENSING THESE MEN
BELONG TO A PRISON BROTHERHOOD,

21:16.040 --> 21:17.632
A SMALL CADRE, IF YOU WILL.

21:17.670 --> 21:19.638
THIS INDICATES
THERE COULD BE AN ACCOMPLICE

21:19.670 --> 21:21.501
WHO POTENTIALLY AIDED
IN THE ESCAPE OF NORTHCUTT

21:21.540 --> 21:23.030
AND SANFUS SANDERS.

21:23.080 --> 21:25.002
- WELL, AT THIS POINT I'LL TAKE
ANY LEAD THAT I CAN GET.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.416
OKAY, MR. SPENCER,

21:27.450 --> 21:29.873
LET'S TRY TO FIND OTHER MEMBERS,
IF ANY EVEN EXIST.

21:29.920 --> 21:31.547
AND THE REST OF YOU,
LET'S GET TO WORK.

21:31.590 --> 21:33.751
WE'VE GOT AN HOUR OR TWO
AT MOST TO CATCH THESE GUYS,

21:33.790 --> 21:35.018
AND THEN THEY'RE GONE.

21:35.060 --> 21:36.880
- DEFENSE!

21:38.660 --> 21:40.628
WHAT, WHAT, WHAT?

21:43.060 --> 21:45.028
- HEY, MAN,
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' HERE?

21:45.070 --> 21:48.597
- I HAD TO COME IN TO GIVE MY
STATEMENT TO DETECTIVE LASSITER.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.437
- THAT EXPLAINS THE LONG FACE.

21:50.470 --> 21:52.665
I KNOW DEALING WITH LASSIE
CAN BE VERY UNPLEASANT,

21:52.710 --> 21:55.804
LIKE CRAWLING OVER BROKEN GLASS
OR ANY KIND OF WEINER SURGERY.

21:55.840 --> 21:58.047
- THAT'S NOT REALLY IT.
THE WARDEN CALLED.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.945
HE FIRED ME.

21:59.980 --> 22:01.777
- WHAT?
WHY?

22:01.820 --> 22:04.812
- TWO DANGEROUS CONVICTS
ESCAPED ON MY WATCH.

22:04.850 --> 22:06.784
- COME ON,
I'M SURE A SNAFU LIKE THAT'S

22:06.820 --> 22:08.412
HAPPENED AT THE PRISON BEFORE.

22:08.460 --> 22:10.109
- FIRST TIME.
- OOH.

22:10.160 --> 22:11.479
IN THAT CASE...

22:11.530 --> 22:12.883
- MAN, I'M--
I'M REALLY SORRY.

22:12.930 --> 22:14.124
- I'M NOT.

22:14.160 --> 22:15.627
THERE'S NO EXCUSE
FOR LETTING THOSE MEN

22:15.660 --> 22:16.820
GET THE JUMP ON YOU

22:16.860 --> 22:18.418
AND PUTTING THOSE CIVILIANS
AT RISK.

22:18.470 --> 22:20.995
THE VERY LEAST, YOU SHOULD BE
BLEEDING TO DEATH

22:21.040 --> 22:23.600
FROM A BULLET TAKEN WHILE
TRYING TO STOP THEIR ESCAPE.

22:23.640 --> 22:24.834
- COME ON, LASSIE,
THAT'S NOT REASON

22:24.870 --> 22:26.565
TO KICK A MAN
WHEN HE'S ALREADY DOWN.

22:26.610 --> 22:28.407
- THAT'S EXACTLY
WHEN A MAN SHOULD BE KICKED,

22:28.440 --> 22:30.601
BECAUSE THAT'S
THE ONLY WAY HE LEARNS.

22:30.650 --> 22:32.675
THE NUNS TAUGHT ME THAT.
- WOW.

22:32.710 --> 22:34.473
LASSIE, THE MORE I LEARN
ABOUT YOU,

22:34.520 --> 22:35.771
THE MORE I'M CONVINCED
YOU ARE THE PENGUIN.

22:35.820 --> 22:36.775
- EXCEPT LANKIER.

22:36.820 --> 22:38.708
- I DO MY JOB

22:38.750 --> 22:40.559
AND PUT THOSE
ANIMALS BEHIND BARS.

22:40.590 --> 22:42.785
IT WAS YOUR JOB
TO KEEP THEM THERE.

22:42.820 --> 22:44.788
- YEAH, WELL, YOUR NEXT JOB
IS ABOUT TO BE

22:44.830 --> 22:47.424
THE YOU BETTER GET UP
OUTTA MY FACE KIND.

22:47.460 --> 22:49.155
- GLADLY.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.929
[sniffs]

22:50.970 --> 22:52.892
YOU REEK OF FAILURE.

22:57.070 --> 22:59.630
- GAY DUDE IS RIGHT.
I AM A FAILURE.

22:59.670 --> 23:01.729
I MESSED UP THE ONLY JOB
I EVER HAD.

23:01.780 --> 23:03.975
ONLY THING I KNOW HOW TO DO
IS BE A PRISON GUARD.

23:04.010 --> 23:05.944
I GOT NO OTHER SKILLS.

23:05.980 --> 23:07.470
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
HELPING MY MOM AND DAD

23:07.520 --> 23:08.817
WITH THEIR MEDICAL BILLS.

23:08.850 --> 23:10.738
- HEY, MAN, LOOK...
OFTEN WHEN ONE DOOR CLOSES,

23:10.790 --> 23:13.452
ANOTHER EVEN BETTER DOOR
WILL OPEN IN THE FUTURE.

23:13.490 --> 23:14.286
- WHATEVER.

23:14.320 --> 23:16.083
- GUS AND I CAN GIVE YOU
SOME MONEY.

23:16.120 --> 23:18.088
- THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF DOOR
I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.690
- FELLAS, I APPRECIATE IT,
BUT I CAN'T TAKE YOUR CHARITY.

23:20.730 --> 23:22.493
THAT'S NOT HOW I WAS RAISED.

23:22.530 --> 23:24.020
- I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
CHARITY, CRAIG.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.094
I'M TALKING ABOUT
GIVING YOU A JOB.

23:25.130 --> 23:27.098
TRUTH IS, WE NEED YOU, MAN.
YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT

23:27.130 --> 23:28.995
NORTHCUTT AND SANDERS
THAN ANYBODY.

23:29.040 --> 23:30.564
YOU HELP US FIND THESE GUYS,

23:30.610 --> 23:32.100
AND WE WILL SPLIT OUR FEE
FOR THE CASE.

23:32.140 --> 23:33.573
- STILL NOT THE DOOR
I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

23:33.610 --> 23:34.702
- [high-pitched noise]

23:34.740 --> 23:37.038
- THAT MIGHT BE COOL.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.638
ALL RIGHT, DEAL.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.204
YEAH.
- CRAIG IS BACK!

23:40.250 --> 23:42.218
- ALL RIGHT.
- LET'S GET CRACKIN', MAN.

23:42.250 --> 23:44.514
TO THE BLUEBERRY.
- I'LL GET MY COAT

23:44.550 --> 23:45.687
AND MEET YOU
IN THE PARKING LOT.

23:45.720 --> 23:48.712
MY MAN!
YEAH, BROTHER!

23:48.760 --> 23:50.853
- [laughing] MAN, HOW'S HE
GONNA FIT IN THE CAR?

23:50.890 --> 23:52.187
- I DON'T KNOW!

23:52.230 --> 23:53.754
SHAWN, I'M ALL ABOUT
HELPING A BROTHER OUT,

23:53.800 --> 23:55.199
BUT DID YOU HAVE TO
OFFER HIM HALF?

23:55.230 --> 23:56.891
- DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL GIVE HIM MY HALF.

23:56.930 --> 23:59.569
WON'T COST YOU A CENT.
- SO NOW I'M THE GREEDY MISER?

23:59.600 --> 24:02.433
NO. WE'LL GIVE HIM MY HALF.
- AND...DONE.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.208
- ALL RIGHT, COOL.
THANKS, HECTOR.

24:08.240 --> 24:12.199
ALL RIGHT, SO...MY MAN
WHO'S A GUARD IN UNIT B

24:12.250 --> 24:14.013
SAYS THAT SANDERS
AND NORTHCUTT

24:14.050 --> 24:16.075
FORMED THE TRES DIABLOS
FIVE YEARS AGO

24:16.120 --> 24:17.485
WITH NORTHCUTT'S CELLMATE.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.147
HIS NAME'S PERCY DUNN.

24:19.190 --> 24:21.579
- PERCY DUNN.
THE LIGHTNING THIEF.

24:21.620 --> 24:23.212
- NO. THAT'S PERCY JACKSON,
SHAWN.

24:23.260 --> 24:25.478
- BY THE WAY, HE COULD HAVE
HELPED THEM PLOT THEIR ESCAPE.

24:25.530 --> 24:26.451
LET'S QUESTION HIM.

24:26.490 --> 24:28.526
- YOU AIN'T GETTIN' NOTHING
OUTTA DUNN, MAN.

24:28.560 --> 24:31.028
HE BEEN DEAD TWO YEARS.
- HMM.

24:31.070 --> 24:32.162
- DUNN. I FEEL LIKE
I SAW THAT NAME

24:32.200 --> 24:33.531
IN ONE OF THE ESCAPEE FILES.

24:33.570 --> 24:34.696
- COME ON, GUS...
DON'T SAY THINGS

24:34.740 --> 24:36.139
JUST FOR THE SAKE
OF MAKING NOISE.

24:36.170 --> 24:37.808
- NO. HERE IT IS RIGHT HERE.

24:37.840 --> 24:41.571
"LORRAINE DUNN.
2409 VIA ESPERANZA."

24:41.610 --> 24:43.578
SHE'S A VOLUNTEER
G.E.D. TUTOR AT THE PRISON.

24:43.610 --> 24:45.976
AND GUESS WHO'S BEEN
ONE OF HER REGULAR STUDENTS

24:46.010 --> 24:47.819
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS.

24:47.850 --> 24:48.817
NORTHCUTT.

24:48.850 --> 24:50.681
- MM-MM...

24:50.720 --> 24:52.984
- TO THE BLUE--
- SHAWN.

24:54.320 --> 24:55.981
- [whispers]
BERRY.

25:01.800 --> 25:06.089
- I MET DANE WHEN HE SHARED
A CELL WITH MY LATE SON...

25:06.130 --> 25:07.563
PERCY.

25:07.600 --> 25:10.137
- HMM. IS THAT YOU
AND PERCY THERE?

25:10.170 --> 25:12.263
- YES. I USED TO WORK
AT THAT CHURCH.

25:12.310 --> 25:15.632
AND PERCY WOULD HELP ME
CLEAN THE PLACE AFTER SCHOOL.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.170
WE DIDN'T MAKE MUCH MONEY,

25:17.210 --> 25:19.678
BUT IT WAS ENOUGH
TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE

25:19.710 --> 25:21.177
AND KEEP PERCY OUT OF TROUBLE.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.916
IT'S NO COINCIDENCE

25:23.950 --> 25:25.542
THAT WHEN THE CHURCH
WAS BOARDED UP,

25:25.590 --> 25:27.182
PERCY STARTED RUNNING
WITH THE GANGS.

25:27.220 --> 25:29.256
AND WE KNOW HOW THAT ENDED.

25:29.290 --> 25:31.588
DANE REALLY HELPED ME
WITH MY GRIEF

25:31.630 --> 25:33.188
AFTER PERCY PASSED AWAY.

25:33.230 --> 25:35.027
- THE TWO OF YOU GOT PRETTY
CLOSE OVER THE YEARS.

25:35.060 --> 25:38.188
- DANE...MEANS THE WORLD
TO ME.

25:38.230 --> 25:40.733
- 'SCUSE ME.
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS DRINK?

25:40.770 --> 25:43.068
- IT'S MY HOMEMADE HORCHATA.

25:43.100 --> 25:45.034
- IT IS SURPRISINGLY TASTY.

25:45.070 --> 25:47.163
- AH, GRACIAS.
- GUS, DO YOU MIND?

25:47.210 --> 25:49.337
WE'RE SORT OF
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.

25:49.380 --> 25:51.348
[scoffs]
MRS. DUNN...

25:51.380 --> 25:53.678
THIS IS MUY IMPORTANTE.

25:55.120 --> 25:58.317
DID DANE TRY TO CONTACT YOU
AFTER HE ESCAPED CUSTODY?

25:58.350 --> 26:00.147
- NO. HE HASN'T.

26:00.190 --> 26:01.316
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:01.360 --> 26:02.782
I THINK I'LL HAVE
ONE MORE GLASS

26:02.820 --> 26:06.085
OF THIS DELICIOUS HORCHATA,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

26:09.030 --> 26:10.588
- EH--I--

26:10.630 --> 26:12.598
I JUST CLEANED THIS TABLE.

26:18.270 --> 26:19.806
- UH, SHAWN,

26:19.840 --> 26:21.603
LET ME HOLLER AT YOU
FOR A SECOND.

26:28.120 --> 26:31.681
- THIS CRACKER'S LYING.
- I KNOW, BUT, UH...

26:31.720 --> 26:33.381
CRACKER?

26:33.420 --> 26:35.388
- IT'S PRISON 101, SHAWN.

26:35.420 --> 26:37.115
CONVICTS' MOMS
LIE TO PROTECT THEIR SONS.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.650
YOU HEARD HER.

26:38.690 --> 26:40.226
NORTHCUTT IS LIKE
HER OWN FLESH AND BLOOD.

26:40.260 --> 26:42.956
NO WAY HE WOULD HAVE LEFT TOWN
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE.

26:52.140 --> 26:54.199
SO HOW YOU WANNA HANDLE IT?

26:54.240 --> 26:56.401
- I'M A PSYCHIC DETECTIVE,
REMEMBER?

26:56.440 --> 26:58.249
- NOT REALLY.

26:59.380 --> 27:01.314
- MRS. DUNN...

27:01.350 --> 27:03.238
I'M AFRAID YOU LIED TO US.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.646
NOW, DO WE NEED TO CALL
THE POLICE?

27:05.690 --> 27:07.180
BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO KNOW
A DETECTIVE

27:07.220 --> 27:10.417
WHO DOESN'T MIND
ROUGHING UP OLDER WOMEN.

27:10.460 --> 27:12.826
- OKAY.

27:12.860 --> 27:14.088
HE WAS HERE.

27:14.130 --> 27:15.791
DANE WAS HERE EARLIER.

27:15.830 --> 27:17.764
- WHAT DID HE SAY?
WHERE'S HE HEADED?

27:17.800 --> 27:19.290
- HE DIDN'T TELL ME.

27:19.330 --> 27:22.128
HE JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE
I WAS OKAY.

27:22.170 --> 27:24.331
AND TO SEE THE ROOM
WHERE PERCY GREW UP...

27:24.370 --> 27:26.031
TO PAY HIS RESPECT S.

27:26.070 --> 27:28.675
THAT'S ALL, I SWEAR.

27:30.480 --> 27:31.742
- GUS.

27:39.090 --> 27:41.183
- MS. DUNN ISN'T MUCH
OF A HOUSE CLEANER

27:41.220 --> 27:43.381
FOR SOMEONE SO TRIGGER-HAPPY
WITH THEIR PLEDGE.

28:11.450 --> 28:14.089
- GUS, CRAIG.

28:14.120 --> 28:16.384
I'VE ARRIVED AT THE FOLLOWING
TWO CONCLUSIONS.

28:16.420 --> 28:18.251
FIRST, THIS IS LIKELY

28:18.290 --> 28:20.281
ONE OF THE LARGEST PENCILS
IN NORTH AMERICA.

28:20.330 --> 28:21.297
- AGREED.
- AND I KNOW

28:21.330 --> 28:24.390
WHAT NORTHCUTT
WAS LOOKING FOR.

28:24.430 --> 28:26.967
A KEY.
AND HE FOUND IT.

28:30.470 --> 28:32.461
CHIEF, I'M SENSING THE KEY
THAT NORTHCUTT FOUND IN THE VENT

28:32.510 --> 28:34.375
IS ALSO THE KEY
TO WHERE HE IS GOING.

28:34.410 --> 28:35.968
PUN INTENDED.
- IT WASN'T A PUN.

28:36.010 --> 28:38.149
YOU JUST USED
THE SAME WORD TWICE.

28:38.180 --> 28:40.478
- NOTED AND IGNORED.
- I JUST GOT A TIP FROM MY CI.

28:40.510 --> 28:42.478
TWO MEN MATCHING
THE DESCRIPTION OF OUR SUSPECT S

28:42.520 --> 28:44.385
JUST HIRED AN IMMIGRANT SMUGGLER
TO GET THEM OUT OF THE COUNTRY.

28:44.420 --> 28:46.183
IT'S FAIRLY CERTAIN THE VEHICLE
BEING USED IN THE JOB

28:46.220 --> 28:47.448
IS A LOCALLY OWNED BIG RIG

28:47.490 --> 28:49.185
SET TO LEAVE SANTA BARBARA
IN TWO HOURS.

28:49.220 --> 28:51.825
WHAT IS THIS EMBARRASSMENT
TO LAW ENFORCEMENT DOING HERE?

28:51.860 --> 28:54.397
- I'M ABOUT TO KICK YOUR
ICHABOD CRANE-LOOKING ASS,

28:54.430 --> 28:55.920
THAT'S WHAT.
- ENOUGH, ENOUGH!

28:55.960 --> 28:57.450
WE ARE RUNNING SHORT OF TIME.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.263
- LET'S GO, COME ON.
- I NEED YOU--LASSITER.

28:59.300 --> 29:00.836
LASSITER.

29:00.870 --> 29:03.395
I NEED YOU TO TRACK DOWN ASAP

29:03.440 --> 29:06.409
EVERY COYOTE THAT'S BEEN BUSTED
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS.

29:06.440 --> 29:09.136
AND PULL THE MANIFEST
FROM EVERY TRUCKING COMPANY

29:09.180 --> 29:10.431
AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR

29:10.480 --> 29:14.109
WHO HAS A RIG THAT MEETS
THESE CRITERIA...PLEASE.

29:14.150 --> 29:16.345
- YES, MA'AM.
- YES, MA'AM.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.416
- OH...

29:18.450 --> 29:21.317
YOU ARE SO LUCKY
SHE'S STANDING THERE.

29:22.860 --> 29:24.987
- MR. GUSTER, MR. SPENCER,

29:25.030 --> 29:26.986
JUST GO FOLLOW THE KEY LEAD.

29:27.030 --> 29:28.998
- YOU GOT IT.
- WE'RE ON IT.

29:29.030 --> 29:30.452
- LET'S GO, BABY.

29:33.970 --> 29:36.438
WE NEED TO ACCESS
PERCY DUNN'S PRISON FILE,

29:36.470 --> 29:38.006
SEE IF THERE'S ANYTHING
IN THERE

29:38.040 --> 29:40.429
TO TELL US
WHAT THAT KEY MIGHT BE FOR.

29:40.470 --> 29:42.438
CRAIG, I HAVE AN IDEA.

29:42.480 --> 29:44.505
WHY DON'T YOU USE
MY DAD'S COMPUTER?

29:47.450 --> 29:49.816
- MY SECURITY CODE STILL WORKS
IN THE PRISON DATABASE.

29:49.850 --> 29:51.408
- SWEET.
- PERCY DUNN.

29:51.450 --> 29:54.817
IT SAYS HERE HIS LAST STRETCH
WAS 20 YEARS FOR ARMED ROBBERY.

29:54.860 --> 29:57.249
- DUNN WAS INVOLVED IN THE
CALIFORNIA FEDERAL HEIST OF '99.

29:57.290 --> 29:58.427
I REMEMBER READING
ABOUT THAT.

29:58.460 --> 30:00.451
SOMETHING ABOUT IT
WAS NEVER SOLVED.

30:00.490 --> 30:01.457
- YEAH, I HEARD THERE WAS
$1 MILLION IN CASH

30:01.500 --> 30:03.252
THAT WAS NEVER RECOVERED.

30:03.300 --> 30:04.562
- FELLAS, THAT'S IT--DUNN
AND NORTHCUTT WERE CELLMATES.

30:04.600 --> 30:06.090
DUNN KNEW
HE WASN'T GONNA MAKE IT,

30:06.130 --> 30:07.358
SO HE TOLD NORTHCUTT
WHERE HE STASHED THE MILLION,

30:07.400 --> 30:10.494
AND THAT IS WHAT
THE KEY IS FOR.

30:10.540 --> 30:14.408
- BUT WHERE'S THE KEY TO?
- LOCKER.

30:14.440 --> 30:16.499
- A STORAGE ROOM?
- SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX.

30:19.350 --> 30:21.477
- HEY, GUYS, ANY NEW LEADS?

30:21.520 --> 30:23.579
- HOW YOU FEEL, MAMA?

30:23.620 --> 30:25.986
- DUDE...REALLY?

30:26.020 --> 30:28.386
- SHE A DIME PIECE.

30:28.420 --> 30:29.978
- DIME PIECE?

30:30.020 --> 30:31.624
WHAT IS THAT,
LIKE AN INVISIBLE STOPWATCH

30:31.660 --> 30:33.389
OR A CHOCOLATE COIN?

30:33.430 --> 30:35.489
- IT'S A HOT WOMAN.
A TEN.

30:35.530 --> 30:37.054
AND THANK YOU.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.419
- OH, YEAH.

30:40.670 --> 30:41.864
- WOW.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.065
- YOU AIN'T THE ONLY ONE

30:45.110 --> 30:46.964
WITH A DIME PIECE
WAITING FOR HIM OUT THERE.

30:47.010 --> 30:50.275
- DIME PIECE.
NORTHCUTT HAS A GIRLFRIEND.

30:54.350 --> 30:56.011
- LOOK, I'M GONNA TELL YOU BOYS

30:56.050 --> 30:57.369
THE SAME THING
THAT I TOLD THE COPS--

30:57.420 --> 31:00.480
I HAVEN'T SEEN OR HEARD
FROM DANE IN WEEKS, OKAY?

31:00.520 --> 31:02.954
- UM, SHAWN, CAN I HOLLER
AT YOU FOR A MINUTE?

31:05.030 --> 31:06.383
SHE'S LYING.

31:06.430 --> 31:07.328
- I KNOW.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.351
I ALSO NOTICED
YOU DIDN'T USE "CRACKER."

31:09.400 --> 31:10.492
- I'M COM PLICATED.

31:13.530 --> 31:15.589
- [making engine sounds]

31:15.640 --> 31:18.438
- EVERYONE EMPTY THEIR POCKETS
INTO THIS BAG.

31:20.070 --> 31:21.503
COME ON, GIVE IT UP.

31:21.540 --> 31:23.474
- PATTY.

31:23.510 --> 31:25.046
I'M SENSING THAT WHILE
YOU AND DANE

31:25.080 --> 31:27.298
HAVE HAD YOUR FAIR SHARE
OF PROBLEMS IN THE PAST,

31:27.350 --> 31:31.047
RECENTLY, HE'S TRIED TO BE
A MUCH BETTER FATHER TO TRAVIS.

31:35.020 --> 31:36.453
- OKAY, YEAH,
HE CAME THROUGH HERE EARLIER.

31:36.490 --> 31:39.459
HE WAS BEING
ALL SWEET TO TRAVIS

31:39.490 --> 31:41.424
AND TALKING ABOUT
BUYING US A NEW PLACE

31:41.460 --> 31:43.121
IN A NICE NEW NEIGHBORHOOD.

31:43.160 --> 31:46.197
HE WAS EVEN TALKING ABOUT
GOING TO CHURCH TONIGHT.

31:47.270 --> 31:48.339
- IT'S NO COINCIDENCE

31:48.370 --> 31:50.258
THAT AFTER THE CHURCH
WAS BOARDED UP,

31:50.300 --> 31:52.530
PERCY STARTED
RUNNING WITH THE GANGS.

31:56.710 --> 31:58.246
- I KNOW WHERE
THE MONEY IS.

31:58.280 --> 32:01.374
AND I KNOW WHAT
THE KEY WAS FOR.

32:01.420 --> 32:03.411
- THANK YOU.

32:14.530 --> 32:17.249
- CAN YOU IMAGINE LUGGING
AROUND ALL THAT DOUGH?

32:17.300 --> 32:20.519
YOU HAVE AN IDEA HOW MUCH
A MILLION IN CASH MUST WEIGH?

32:20.570 --> 32:21.559
SERIOUSLY, DO YOU?

32:21.600 --> 32:23.033
- IT'S NOT THAT MUCH, SHAWN.

32:23.070 --> 32:24.537
IT'S LIKE A HUNDRED--
A HUNDRED STACKS.

32:24.570 --> 32:26.435
IT PROBABLY WEIGHS
AS MUCH AS A PUMPKIN.

32:26.470 --> 32:28.631
- AGREE TO DISAGREE.
- THEN WHY DID YOU ASK?

32:28.680 --> 32:29.635
- SHH.
- YOU ASKED ME.

32:29.680 --> 32:30.669
- SHH!

32:34.480 --> 32:36.016
WE'VE GOTTA STOP THOSE GUYS.

32:36.050 --> 32:37.745
- NO. WHAT WE NEED TO DO
IS CALL LASSIE AND JULIET

32:37.780 --> 32:39.247
AND LET THEM STOP THESE GUYS.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.689
- THERE'S NO TIME.
- I AGREE WITH SHAWN.

32:40.720 --> 32:42.517
WE NEED TO MAKE A MOVE
RIGHT NOW.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.584
- FINE.

32:43.620 --> 32:46.726
- EVERYBODY FIND SOMETHING
YOU CAN USE AS A WEAPON.

33:02.740 --> 33:04.742
- SHAWN...

33:27.470 --> 33:28.789
THAT'S WHAT YOU PICKED
AS A WEAPON--

33:28.840 --> 33:30.239
A CANDLE?

33:32.110 --> 33:33.600
- HERE. TAKE THIS.

33:35.510 --> 33:36.704
- IT'S THE BIBLE!

33:36.740 --> 33:38.469
- "AS FOR THE DEEDS OF MEN

33:38.510 --> 33:39.738
"BY THE WORDS OF YOUR LIPS

33:39.780 --> 33:41.418
I HAVE KEPT FROM THE PATHS
OF THE VIOLENT."

33:41.450 --> 33:43.441
PSALMS 17:4.

33:43.480 --> 33:45.289
- WHAT?

33:45.320 --> 33:47.641
- NOW LET US GO FORTH...
AND KICK MUCH ASS.

33:47.690 --> 33:49.555
CRAIG 1:1.

33:57.300 --> 33:59.165
- HAAAH'
-AAH!'

34:02.800 --> 34:05.803
- BETTER THINK ABOUT THAT LITTLE
BOY OF YOURS, NORTHCUTT.

34:15.850 --> 34:17.511
- GUS, IT WORKED.
IT'S A MIRACLE.

34:17.550 --> 34:19.438
- NO, SHAWN, IT'S NOT.

34:20.790 --> 34:22.280
- I'LL TAKE THAT.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.527
- CRAIG.

34:30.730 --> 34:32.823
- I CAN'T BELIEVE CRAIG
TURNED ON US LIKE THAT.

34:32.870 --> 34:33.928
- REALLY? THAT'S FUNNY.

34:33.970 --> 34:34.868
SEEING AS HOW YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT GAVE HIM THE IDEA.

34:34.900 --> 34:37.289
- EXCUSE ME?
- AT THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

34:37.340 --> 34:39.205
YOU TOLD HIM THAT
HE SHOULD HAVE FAITH,

34:39.240 --> 34:41.128
AND GOOD THINGS WOULD HAPPEN
IN HIS LIFE

34:41.180 --> 34:42.738
LIKE, OH, I DON'T KNOW--
FINDING $1 MILLION!

34:42.780 --> 34:44.771
- NO, SHAWN, I MEANT THE KIND
OF FAITH YOU FIND IN THE BIBLE.

34:44.810 --> 34:47.347
YOU KNOW, LIKE "FAITH IS THE
SUBSTANCE OF THINGS HOPED FOR"?

34:47.380 --> 34:48.779
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA CONFUSE ME
BY SWITCHING LANGUAGES.

34:48.820 --> 34:52.119
- JUST SO YOU PUNKS KNOW,
WE'RE GONNA KILL YOU.

34:52.150 --> 34:55.210
THEN WE'RE GONNA GET OUR MONEY
BACK FROM THAT HACK.

34:55.260 --> 34:57.148
- AND KILL HIM.

34:57.190 --> 34:58.555
YEAH !

35:00.760 --> 35:03.194
- YOU'RE NOT WRIGGLING ENOUGH!
- I'M WIGGLING AS MUCH AS I CAN.

35:03.230 --> 35:05.198
- I SAID WRIGGLING, GUS.
- WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE?

35:05.230 --> 35:07.266
I'M DOING AS MUCH AS I CAN.
USE YOUR TEETH TO TEAR THE TAPE.

35:07.300 --> 35:08.790
- I JUST GOT THEM CLEANED.
- SHAWN--

35:08.840 --> 35:10.728
- WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO COME UP
WITH ANOTHER WAY OUT OF THIS.

35:10.770 --> 35:11.737
- I KNOW!

35:11.770 --> 35:13.408
- WHAT'S THE FIRST THING
THAT COMES TO YOUR MIND?

35:13.440 --> 35:15.408
- I'M ABOUT TO DIE.
- WHAT'S THE SECOND THING?

35:15.440 --> 35:16.702
- I'M ABOUT TO DIE
ON AN EMPTY STOMACH!

35:16.740 --> 35:18.173
- MAN, WHAT'S THE THIRD THING?
- I DON'T KNOW!

35:18.210 --> 35:20.303
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME,
SHAWN--THE CABINET?

35:20.350 --> 35:21.772
both: THE CABINET!

35:21.820 --> 35:23.412
- OH, WE GOT THE DROP ON YOU!

35:23.450 --> 35:25.418
- LET'S GO!
- THIS WAY!

35:34.830 --> 35:35.854
[thunk]

35:35.900 --> 35:37.390
[pounding]

35:37.430 --> 35:39.421
- LET'S GO, LET'S GO!

35:46.440 --> 35:49.807
- HOLD UP, CRAIG!
- HEY!

35:49.840 --> 35:51.876
THAT'S A COMPANY CAR!
- CRAIG!

35:54.850 --> 35:56.647
- DAMN.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.787
- DUDE, IF WE GO THROUGH
THOSE WOODS,

36:00.820 --> 36:03.550
WE CAN CUT HIM OFF BEFORE
HE HITS THE BOTTOM OF THE DRIVE.

36:03.590 --> 36:06.650
THE QUESTION IS...
DO WE STILL HAVE OUR GOOD STUFF?

36:06.690 --> 36:08.794
- OF COURSE WE DO.
WE CAN DO THIS, SHAWN.

36:08.830 --> 36:10.957
- DAMN RIGHT, WE CAN.
WE'RE THE BEST THERE EVER WAS.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.491
- WHAT?
- SHARED LEG FIRST.

36:14.540 --> 36:15.893
SYNCOPATED BREATHING.

36:21.810 --> 36:23.573
- OH!
-AAH!

36:31.520 --> 36:33.909
- HA HA HA HA!

36:33.950 --> 36:34.917
OH, HELL!

36:34.960 --> 36:35.915
NO!

36:35.960 --> 36:37.279
NO, NO, NO.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.651
[tires screeching]

36:38.690 --> 36:40.851
both: AAH!

36:44.500 --> 36:48.231
[Gus whimpers]

36:48.270 --> 36:50.989
- SHAWN. SHAWN, GUS.

36:51.040 --> 36:53.008
COME ON, HERE YOU GO.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.576
- [grunting]

36:54.610 --> 36:58.398
- OH, MAN, I'M SO GLAD
YOU TWO ARE ALL RIGHT.

36:58.450 --> 36:59.940
I MEAN, I COULD NEVER
LIVE WITH MYSELF

36:59.980 --> 37:02.369
IF I HURT EITHER ONE OF YOU.

37:02.420 --> 37:03.944
OKAY.

37:03.980 --> 37:04.947
BYE.

37:04.990 --> 37:06.548
- WHAT?
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

37:06.590 --> 37:08.251
ISN'T THIS WHERE YOU'RE
SUPPOSED TO RECONSIDER

37:08.290 --> 37:09.552
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

37:09.590 --> 37:11.649
- WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
- BECAUSE IT'S WRONG.

37:11.690 --> 37:13.328
- YOU'RE BETTER THAN THIS,
CRAIG!

37:13.360 --> 37:15.897
- I USED TO BE.
HELL, I HAD A GOOD CAREER.

37:15.930 --> 37:18.592
I WAS MAKING AROUND 40K A YEAR
WITH EXCELLENT BENEFITS,

37:18.630 --> 37:19.699
BUT THAT'S ALL GONE NOW.

37:19.730 --> 37:21.732
HELL, IN THIS JOB CLIMATE,

37:21.770 --> 37:23.829
I'D BE LUCKY TO LAND
A PART-TIME GIG SOMEWHERE

37:23.870 --> 37:25.633
AS A NIGHT WATCHMAN MAKING 15.

37:25.670 --> 37:26.762
- DUDE, I HAD NO IDEA
IT WAS SO ROUGH OUT THERE.

37:26.810 --> 37:27.799
- YEAH, IT IS.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.034
- HOW MUCH DID WE MAKE
LAST YEAR?

37:29.080 --> 37:30.331
- I'M NOT TELLING YOU.
- THAT'S FAIR.

37:30.380 --> 37:32.348
- HELL, WITH THIS MONEY,

37:32.380 --> 37:34.575
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MY PARENTS,
MY GRANDPARENTS,

37:34.620 --> 37:36.042
MY AUNTIES, MY UNCLES,

37:36.080 --> 37:38.287
MY LITTLE COUSIN BRUCIE
AND MIN-MIN AND THEM.

37:38.320 --> 37:39.582
I CAN GET THESE CORNS REMOVED,

37:39.620 --> 37:41.019
AND I MIGHT EVEN HAVE
A LITTLE LEFT OVER

37:41.050 --> 37:42.859
TO FULFILL MY LIFELONG DREAM

37:42.890 --> 37:45.029
OF OPENING A WINE BAR
IN BANGKOK.

37:45.060 --> 37:47.528
- THOSE SEEM LIKE
WORTHY GOALS, CRAIG.

37:47.560 --> 37:49.721
THE QUESTION
YOU WAN NA ASK YOURSELF--

37:49.760 --> 37:51.728
DOES BANGKOK
NEED ANOTHER WINE BAR?

37:51.770 --> 37:53.590
- SERIOUSLY, SHAWN, THAT'S
THE QUESTION YOU WANNA ASK?

37:53.630 --> 37:54.699
- I'M CONCERNED
THAT THE TURKISH MARKET

37:54.740 --> 37:55.968
IS A LITTLE OVERSATURATED.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.036
- BANGKOK IS IN THAILAND,
SHAWN.

37:58.070 --> 37:59.867
THE MORE IMPORTANT QUESTION
IS, CRAIG,

37:59.910 --> 38:02.401
DO YOU WANNA THROW AWAY
AN ENTIRE LIFE OF DOING RIGHT

38:02.440 --> 38:04.544
FOR THIS ONE WRONG?

38:04.580 --> 38:07.708
- THINK ABOUT IT.

38:07.750 --> 38:09.877
NOW, GIMME THE GUN, CRAIG.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.584
- NO.

38:15.620 --> 38:17.759
both: AAH!

38:20.630 --> 38:22.928
- [groaning]

38:25.630 --> 38:26.767
- YES!
- YES!

38:26.800 --> 38:29.667
- WHAT?
- DUDE, I AM SO PROUD OF YOU!

38:29.700 --> 38:31.668
I BETTER CALL LASSIE
AND JULES.

38:31.710 --> 38:34.770
GUS, YOU AND CRAIG MAKE SURE
THOSE GUYS STAY PUT.

38:34.810 --> 38:35.970
- YOU GOT IT, PARTNER.

38:36.010 --> 38:37.773
- WAIT--NO--YAH!
- WAIT, WAIT!

38:37.810 --> 38:39.801
_ AAHI
[thud]

38:45.120 --> 38:46.280
- HOPE YOU ENJOYED
YOUR FURLOUGH, FELLOWS.

38:46.320 --> 38:50.814
- BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE GETTING
A NEXT ONE UNTIL FOREVER.

38:50.860 --> 38:52.487
- YEAH, UM...

38:52.530 --> 38:53.758
PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA

38:53.790 --> 38:56.099
TO TAUNT
VIOLENT CRIMINALS, FELLOWS.

38:56.130 --> 38:57.097
YOU NEVER KNOW,
THEY MIGHT ESCAPE

38:57.130 --> 38:58.722
OR, YOU KNOW, GET OUT SOMEDAY,

38:58.770 --> 39:00.897
AND BELIEVE ME, THEY--
THEY HOLD GRUDGES.

39:00.930 --> 39:02.488
- 'EXCUSE THE SARCASM!
- JUST KIDDING!

39:02.540 --> 39:03.734
LITTLE JOKE.

39:03.770 --> 39:06.034
- MESSIN' AROUND
WITH YOU GUYS.

39:06.070 --> 39:08.971
- HEY, LISTEN,
I'M REALLY SORRY.

39:09.010 --> 39:11.103
I LOST MY HEAD BACK THERE
AT THE CHURCH.

39:11.140 --> 39:13.677
I KNOW WE PROBABLY CAN'T BE
FRIENDS AFTER WHAT I'VE DONE,

39:13.710 --> 39:14.972
BUT I HOPE YOU FORGIVE ME.

39:15.020 --> 39:17.443
- LISTEN, CRAIG,
EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES.

39:17.480 --> 39:18.708
- THAT'S WHAT MAKES US HUMAN.

39:18.750 --> 39:20.911
THE IMPORTANT THING IS
IS THAT IN THE END

39:20.950 --> 39:23.487
YOU MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE.

39:23.520 --> 39:24.987
- SOUNDS LIKE THE WRAP UP
TO A SCOOBY-DOO EPISODE.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.054
- I KNOW.

39:26.090 --> 39:27.648
- I DIDN'T REALLY...

39:27.690 --> 39:30.796
JUST TO PROVE TO YOU
THAT WE DO NOT HOLD GRUDGES,

39:30.830 --> 39:33.822
WE ARE STILL GONNA
SPLIT OUR FEE WITH YOU.

39:33.870 --> 39:35.735
- I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

39:35.770 --> 39:37.738
I MEAN, ESPECIALLY SINCE
I'M THE ONE THAT OWES YOU.

39:37.770 --> 39:39.658
- I KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

39:39.710 --> 39:41.109
- HEY, SOUNDS LIKE THINGS
GOT A LITTLE HAIRY

39:41.140 --> 39:42.676
DOWN AT THE CHURCH.

39:42.710 --> 39:45.144
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?

39:46.680 --> 39:47.806
- UH...

39:47.850 --> 39:50.148
WELL...

39:50.180 --> 39:52.489
NORTHCUTT AND SANDERS THERE,

39:52.520 --> 39:54.681
GOT THE DROP ON GUS AND I,
WHICH IS RARE.

39:54.720 --> 39:57.917
BUT LUCKILY, CRAIG
WAS THERE TO SAVE THE DAY.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.428
- IT WAS PRETTY CUT AND DRY.

40:00.460 --> 40:02.052
- WELL, GREAT JOB, OFFICER.

40:02.100 --> 40:05.024
AND I'LL HAVE YOU KNOW I'VE
ALREADY SPOKEN TO THE WARDEN,

40:05.070 --> 40:06.662
AND IN LIGHT OF
YOUR ACTIONS TODAY,

40:06.700 --> 40:07.894
I THINK THERE'S
AN EXCELLENT CHANCE

40:07.930 --> 40:09.466
YOU'RE GOING TO GET
YOUR JOB BACK.

40:09.500 --> 40:10.865
- BOOM!
- WHAT?! SEE?

40:10.900 --> 40:14.870
I TOLD YOU THINGS WORK OUT
IF YOU HAVE A LITTLE FAITH.

40:14.910 --> 40:16.730
- AND THERE'S MORE GOOD NEWS.

40:16.780 --> 40:18.645
THERE'S $100,000 REWARD

40:18.680 --> 40:21.444
FOR RETURNING THE STOLEN MONEY
FROM THE CAL FED ROBBERY.

40:21.480 --> 40:22.617
- ALL RIGHT!

40:22.650 --> 40:24.140
- SO CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN,
CRAIG.

40:24.180 --> 40:25.716
- UH, IT'S "CRAYG."

40:25.750 --> 40:27.889
- "CRAYG."
OKAY.

40:27.920 --> 40:30.753
- HERCULES, HERCULES,
HERCULES.

40:30.790 --> 40:32.018
HA HA HA HA!

40:32.060 --> 40:33.755
DUDE, THAT'S AWESOME!

40:33.790 --> 40:35.018
- OH, WOW!

40:35.060 --> 40:36.527
GUS, YOU WERE SO RIGHT!

40:36.560 --> 40:38.027
- YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

40:38.060 --> 40:40.028
- THIS TURNED OUT BETTER THAN
I COULD EVER IMAGINE!

40:40.070 --> 40:41.162
- 100 Gs!

40:41.200 --> 40:43.691
- OKAY'
- H00!-

40:43.740 --> 40:45.162
- BYE.

40:45.210 --> 40:47.838
- HA HA HA!

40:47.870 --> 40:48.837
TAKE CARE, MAN.

40:51.610 --> 40:53.749
WAIT A MINUTE.
ISN'T HE FORGETTING SOMETHING?

40:53.780 --> 40:54.872
- THE PART ABOUT
HOW HE OWES US.

40:54.920 --> 40:56.171
- YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.

40:56.220 --> 40:57.175
- CRAIG!

40:57.220 --> 40:59.211
- NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, CRAIG.

41:03.060 --> 41:05.085
- DUDE, WE GOT A POST CARD
FROM CRAIG.

41:07.090 --> 41:08.728
- OH. I GUESS YOU WERE WRONG

41:08.760 --> 41:11.058
ABOUT THE BANGKOK
WINE BAR MARKET.

41:11.100 --> 41:13.022
- YOU KNOW, TECHNICALLY
HALF OF THAT WINE BAR IS OURS.

41:13.070 --> 41:14.492
WE SHOULD GO OVER THERE
AND CLAIM IT.

41:14.540 --> 41:15.791
- EXCEPT WE CAN'T AFFORD
THE AIR FARE

41:15.840 --> 41:17.660
BECAUSE YOU GAVE AWAY
HALF OUR FEE.

41:17.700 --> 41:19.065
- IT WAS FOR A WORTHY CAUSE.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.829
- SPEAKING OF A WORTHY CAUSE,

41:21.880 --> 41:22.801
THERE'S ANOTHER
ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP

41:22.840 --> 41:24.649
ON THE ISLAND THIS AFTERNOON.

41:24.680 --> 41:26.238
- GUS, I WILL TELL YOU EXACTLY
THE SAME THING

41:26.280 --> 41:28.043
I TOLD YOU LAST TIME--NO.

41:28.080 --> 41:30.139
- COOL.
I GET IT.

41:30.180 --> 41:32.819
- [gasp5]
THANKS, MAN, I WAS STARVING.

41:32.850 --> 41:34.511
- SO EASY.
- PACKED WITH PEANUTS!
