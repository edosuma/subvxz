WEBVTT

00:00.671 --> 00:02.133
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.335
THAT MANIAC WAS SERVING
A LIFE SENTENCE.

00:04.335 --> 00:06.037
(Paul) HELLO, LADIES.

00:06.037 --> 00:08.079
PAUL YOUNG CAME BACK.

00:08.079 --> 00:11.282
DOUG IS LEAVING ME.
 LYNETTE'S FRIEND HAD
NOWHERE TO GO.

00:11.282 --> 00:14.115
I'VE SPENT EIGHT YEARS
LOVING SOMEONE ELSE'S DAUGHTER.

00:14.115 --> 00:18.649
A BABY WAS SWITCHED LONG AGO,
AND CARLOS MADE A DECISION.

00:18.649 --> 00:21.122
WE'RE NOT TELLING GABY.
 SUSAN GOT A JOB OFFER.

00:21.122 --> 00:23.654
WOMEN DOING HOUSEWORK
IN LINGERIE.

00:23.654 --> 00:26.127
WHILE BREE'S CONTRACTOR...

00:26.127 --> 00:27.698
WITH YOUR RED HAIR, YOU WILL
LOOK SO HOT IN THIS ROOM.

00:27.698 --> 00:30.801
BROUGHT POSSIBILITIES TO LIGHT.

00:33.404 --> 00:35.806
(grunts) ALL SET.

00:35.806 --> 00:37.808
NOW THAT YOU'RE
A BIKER CHICK,

00:37.808 --> 00:41.572
THERE'S ONE OTHER THING
YOU GOTTA KNOW HOW TO DO.

00:44.375 --> 00:46.077
THANKS, MISTER.

00:46.077 --> 00:49.080
(bicycle bell rings)

00:50.821 --> 00:53.324
(Mary Alice)
IT HAD BEEN A LONG TIME

00:53.324 --> 00:57.088
SINCE BREE VAN DE KAMP
WAS A LITTLE GIRL,

00:57.088 --> 00:59.660
BUT SHE COULD STILL REMEMBER

00:59.660 --> 01:04.194
EVERYTHING SHE'D EVER BEEN TOLD
ABOUT SEX.

01:04.194 --> 01:09.640
HER GRANDMOTHER INFORMED HER
IT WAS A WOMAN'S BURDEN.

01:09.640 --> 01:14.305
HER MINISTER WARNED HER
IT WAS A SIN.

01:14.305 --> 01:19.110
HER TEACHER TAUGHT HER
IT WAS UNHEALTHY.

01:19.110 --> 01:22.082
YES, EVERYONE HAD TOLD BREE

01:22.082 --> 01:25.816
HER SEXUAL URGES
WERE DANGEROUS.

01:25.816 --> 01:29.690
BUT NO ONE HAD EVER TOLD HER...

01:29.690 --> 01:32.393
HOW TO GET RID OF THEM.

01:32.393 --> 01:35.095
HEY. THERE YOU ARE.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.168
I'M OFF TO THE BANK.

01:37.168 --> 01:39.230
BEFORE YOU GO,
I WANNA SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

01:39.230 --> 01:41.232
COME HERE. WHOLE NEW IDEA.

01:41.232 --> 01:44.205
I WANNA PANEL THE STUDY
IN THIS.

01:44.205 --> 01:46.777
OH. WELL, THAT'S, UH,
UNUSUAL.

01:46.777 --> 01:48.779
HISTORICAL BIRCH
FROM A WYOMING SNOW FENCE.

01:48.779 --> 01:50.881
OVER 200 YEARS OLD.
FEEL IT.

01:50.881 --> 01:53.314
NO. REALLY.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.846
FEEL IT.

01:55.846 --> 01:58.649
YOU KNOW WHAT
THEY CALL THIS?

01:58.649 --> 02:00.851
WITNESS WOOD, 'CAUSE IT'S SEEN
SO MUCH HISTORY,

02:00.851 --> 02:02.853
UNLIKE ME,
WHO SLEPT THROUGH HISTORY

02:02.853 --> 02:04.855
AND HAD TO GO
TO SUMMER SCHOOL.

02:04.855 --> 02:06.457
(laughs)

02:06.457 --> 02:08.829
I HAVE TO GO. IT'S LATE.

02:16.637 --> 02:20.711
YES, WHEN BREE WAS
A LITTLE GIRL,

02:20.711 --> 02:22.213
SHE'D BEEN TAUGHT

02:22.213 --> 02:25.145
HER SEXUAL URGES
WERE DANGEROUS.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.849
UNFORTUNATELY,
SHE WAS ABOUT TO LEARN...

02:28.849 --> 02:31.151
(gasps)
 (thud, bicycle bell rings)

02:31.151 --> 02:34.355
THOSE URGES WERE DANGEROUS...
 (gasps)

02:34.355 --> 02:35.886
FOR EVERYONE.

02:35.886 --> 02:38.929
(whispers) JUANITA.
OH, HEY. OH.

02:49.840 --> 02:52.403
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

02:52.403 --> 02:55.376
THE DOCTORS AND NURSES
AT FAIRVIEW HOSPITAL

02:55.376 --> 02:57.848
ARE EXPERTS AT HEALING.

02:57.848 --> 03:00.881
THEY CAN SET BONES...

03:00.881 --> 03:03.454
BANDAGE WOUNDS...

03:03.454 --> 03:07.187
AND TREAT DISEASES.

03:07.187 --> 03:11.762
SADLY, ONE THING
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO HEAL

03:11.762 --> 03:13.824
IS A GUILTY CONSCIENCE.

03:13.824 --> 03:16.597
I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
SHE JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.

03:16.597 --> 03:18.729
OH, HONEY, THIS COULD'VE BEEN
ANY OF US.

03:18.729 --> 03:21.402
KIDS ON THAT STREET ARE ALWAYS
PLAYING WHERE THEY SHOULDN'T BE.

03:21.402 --> 03:23.404
STILL, I WOULD JUST FEEL BETTER
IF THEY WOULD COME OUT

03:23.404 --> 03:26.477
AND TELL US SOMETHING.
 JUANITA WAS TALKING WHEN
THEY PUT HER IN THE AMBULANCE,

03:26.477 --> 03:28.479
SO I'M SURE EVERYTHING'S
GONNA BE FINE.

03:28.479 --> 03:31.242
AND I JUST SPOKE
TO ONE OF THE NURSES.

03:31.242 --> 03:33.544
SHE SEEMED PRETTY POSITIVE.
 (Paul) WELL, THAT'S A RELIEF.

03:34.785 --> 03:35.946
PAUL?

03:35.946 --> 03:37.748
W-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:37.748 --> 03:40.991
I HEARD ABOUT THE ACCIDENT,
SO I-I RUSHED RIGHT OVER.

03:40.991 --> 03:42.993
THAT'S WHAT NEIGHBORS DO,
RIGHT?

03:42.993 --> 03:45.796
WELL,
THAT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL.

03:45.796 --> 03:48.359
WE'LL TELL GABY YOU STOPPED BY.

03:48.359 --> 03:50.401
YEAH, DON'T FEEL LIKE
YOU HAVE TO HANG AROUND.

03:50.401 --> 03:52.403
THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO.

03:52.403 --> 03:54.535
WE CAN PRAY.

04:06.817 --> 04:09.820
DEAR LORD, WE ASK THAT
YOU BE WITH THIS YOUNG CHILD

04:09.820 --> 04:11.952
AND WITH THE DOCTORS
CARING FOR HER...
 (mouths words)

04:11.952 --> 04:14.785
(mouths words)
 AND THAT SHE MAY BE RETURNED
IN FULL HEALTH

04:14.785 --> 04:16.957
TO HER LOVING FAMILY.
AMEN.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.390
(all) AMEN.

04:19.390 --> 04:23.033
WELL, I HAVE TO GET HOME.
I'M EXPECTING SOMEONE.

04:23.033 --> 04:25.996
PLEASE EXTEND MY GOOD WISHES
TO GABY.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.743
DEAR LORD, PLEASE DON'T LET
THAT CREEP EVER TOUCH ME AGAIN.

04:32.743 --> 04:33.904
AMEN.

04:35.406 --> 04:37.878
(gasps) OH, GABY,
THANK GOD.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.049
HOW IS JUANITA?

04:39.049 --> 04:40.781
(sighs) SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.484
THEY'RE KEEPING HER
A COUPLE DAYS FOR OBSERVATION.
 OH.

04:43.484 --> 04:46.787
SO I TOLD CARLOS
HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO FLY BACK

04:46.787 --> 04:49.059
FROM HIS BUSINESS TRIP.
 THAT'S GREAT NEWS.

04:49.059 --> 04:50.721
YEAH, IT IS. (chuckles)

04:50.721 --> 04:53.764
UH, BREE, ANDREW, CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

04:55.696 --> 04:56.967
MM.

04:56.967 --> 04:58.669
THANKS FOR COMING.

04:58.669 --> 05:00.401
I FEEL SO BLESSED
TO HAVE SUCH WONDERFUL...

05:00.401 --> 05:03.033
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?!

05:03.033 --> 05:05.305
FIRST YOU TAKE OUT
MY MOTHER-IN-LAW,

05:05.305 --> 05:07.307
THEN YOU GO AFTER
MY DAUGHTER.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.040
ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL OFF EVERY
JUANITA SOLIS ON THE PLANET?!

05:10.040 --> 05:12.042
I ADMIT IT WAS
A TERRIBLE COINCIDENCE.

05:12.042 --> 05:15.486
YOU'RE GETTIN' SLOPPY, YOU KNOW.
THIS ONE WAS IN BROAD DAYLIGHT.
 I'M SORRY.

05:15.486 --> 05:18.549
SHE JUST CAME OUT OF NOWHERE.
 HAVE YOU SEEN MY DAUGHTER?
SHE NEVER COMES OUT OF NOWHERE.

05:18.549 --> 05:21.822
UH, ON A RELATED NOTE, I JUST
WANNA SAY HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE

05:21.822 --> 05:24.825
YOU NOT TELLING CARLOS
ABOUT ME RUNNING OVER HIS MOM.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.828
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THAT ONE
'CAUSE I WASN'T FOND OF HER.

05:27.828 --> 05:31.732
BUT AS FOR THE REST
OF MY FAMILY, LEARN TO SWERVE!

05:31.732 --> 05:32.903
(sighs)

05:32.903 --> 05:35.035
WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING?

05:35.035 --> 05:37.908
I DON'T KNOW. I MEAN,
MAYBE GOD'S PUNISHING US.

05:37.908 --> 05:40.971
OR GOD IS PUNISHING
THE SOLISES,

05:40.971 --> 05:43.043
AND WE'RE JUST DOING
GOD'S WORK.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.646
(sighs) I FEEL AWFUL.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.018
I SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN
FIDDLING WITH THAT RADIO.

05:48.018 --> 05:50.581
RADIO? MOM, I SAW YOU
FROM ACROSS THE STREET.

05:50.581 --> 05:52.583
YOU WERE CHECKING OUT
KEITH'S ASS.

05:52.583 --> 05:54.385
(scoffs) THAT'S PREPOSTEROUS.

05:54.385 --> 05:56.387
YOU WERE LOOKING
AT THAT CONTRACTOR'S BUTT

05:56.387 --> 05:58.559
LIKE YOU WERE WAITING
FOR A SIDE OF STEAK SAUCE.

05:58.559 --> 06:01.632
WATCH YOUR MOUTH. THIS ISN'T ONE
OF YOUR HOMOSEXUAL DANCE CLUBS.

06:01.632 --> 06:03.934
I'M TELLING YOU,
IT WAS THE RADIO.

06:03.934 --> 06:06.637
OKAY. FINE. BUT WHILE WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT THE RADIO,

06:06.637 --> 06:09.039
UH, YOU DO KNOW THAT
THAT PARTICULAR MODEL IS, LIKE,

06:09.039 --> 06:11.041
15 YEARS TOO YOUNG FOR YOU,
RIGHT?

06:14.575 --> 06:18.108
(vacuum whirring)

06:30.060 --> 06:32.463
(doorbell rings)
 WHO IS IT?

06:32.463 --> 06:33.924
MAXINE.

06:33.924 --> 06:35.926
OH!
 (turns off vacuum)

06:35.926 --> 06:39.099
OH, UH, HANG ON A SECOND.

06:39.099 --> 06:42.402
AH, I WAS JUST WRAPPING UP
MY FIRST SESSION.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.105
I KNOW. I WAS WATCHING.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.037
AND?

06:47.037 --> 06:48.909
WHAT'D YOU THINK?

06:48.909 --> 06:50.911
IT WAS LIKE WATCHING A DREAM.

06:50.911 --> 06:53.744
AND YOU KNOW WHY?
'CAUSE I WAS ASLEEP.

06:53.744 --> 06:55.846
(sighs) SIT DOWN, HONEY.

06:55.846 --> 06:58.148
IT'S TIME I GAVE YOU
A FEW POINTERS.

06:59.920 --> 07:00.951
(click)

07:02.953 --> 07:06.557
NOW... YOU SEE WHAT
I'M DOING HERE?

07:06.557 --> 07:07.728
(inhales deeply)

07:07.728 --> 07:10.030
OHH.

07:10.030 --> 07:14.164
AND LET'S NOT FORGET
THE DUSTER.

07:18.569 --> 07:21.872
OKAY. OKAY, I-I GET IT.

07:21.872 --> 07:23.043
(gasps)

07:23.043 --> 07:26.116
AND WHAT HAVE WE HERE?
SMUDGES.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.182
UH, WE EAT OFF THAT TABLE.

07:32.182 --> 07:34.184
AM I MAKING MY POINT?

07:34.184 --> 07:36.727
WE ARE SELLING
A FANTASY HERE.

07:36.727 --> 07:39.459
YOU GOTTA, YOU KNOW,
LOOSEN UP.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.032
I WANT TO. I JUST...

07:42.032 --> 07:46.597
(sighs) I CAN'T STOP THINKING
ABOUT ALL THOSE MEN OUT THERE

07:46.597 --> 07:47.938
WATCHING ME.

07:47.938 --> 07:49.640
YES, THEY'RE WATCHING YOU.

07:49.640 --> 07:52.142
THEY ARE SPENDING
THEIR HARD-EARNED DOLLARS

07:52.142 --> 07:54.144
TO SEE THE PERFECT WOMAN.

07:54.144 --> 07:55.646
(sighs)

07:55.646 --> 07:57.978
YOU, MY DARLING,

07:57.978 --> 08:01.852
HAVE ALL THE POWER HERE.

08:03.053 --> 08:04.685
NOW...

08:04.685 --> 08:07.818
IS THAT A CRUMB I SEE
ON THAT RUG?

08:10.220 --> 08:11.592
(sighs)

08:13.794 --> 08:16.026
(click, vacuum whirring)

08:18.869 --> 08:20.270
MM. OH.

08:20.270 --> 08:22.633
OH.

08:22.633 --> 08:24.104
THAT'S IT.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.636
AH! (laughs)

08:25.636 --> 08:28.008
(laughs) THAT'S MY GIRL.
 OOH! (laughs)

08:28.008 --> 08:30.681
DOUG, IF YOUR LAWYERS DON'T
SWEETEN THE SETTLEMENT OFFER,

08:30.681 --> 08:32.842
I WILL SUE YOU
FOR HALF OF EVERYTHING,

08:32.842 --> 08:34.845
AND THAT INCLUDES
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S NEW IMPLANTS.

08:34.845 --> 08:37.147
YOU PAID FOR 'EM
OUT OF OUR JOINT ACCOUNT,

08:37.147 --> 08:39.519
SO TECHNICALLY,
ONE OF THOSE PUPPIES IS MINE.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.822
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THROW IT IN THE POOL

08:41.822 --> 08:43.823
AND USE IT AS A FLOATIE.
 (beep)

08:43.823 --> 08:45.596
UH, RENEE.

08:45.596 --> 08:48.098
OH, SHE'S GONNA BE DATING
SOON ENOUGH.

08:48.098 --> 08:50.901
IT'S TIME SHE LEARNED
WHAT MEN ARE ALL ABOUT.

08:50.901 --> 08:52.032
NOW, SWEETIE,

08:52.032 --> 08:55.105
WHAT DID AUNTIE RENEE
TEACH YOU ABOUT MARRIAGE?

08:55.105 --> 08:57.037
NEVER SIGN A PRENUP.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.910
OH! JEEZ!
 (door closes)

08:59.910 --> 09:01.742
(Lynette) HEY!

09:01.742 --> 09:05.145
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
HOME FROM WORK?
 I'M NOT FEELING WELL.

09:05.145 --> 09:06.747
AGAIN?
 YEAH.

09:06.747 --> 09:10.220
THAT'S THE THIRD TIME THIS WEEK.
YOU NEED TO GO TO THE DOCTOR.

09:10.220 --> 09:11.922
NO, I'M FINE.

09:11.922 --> 09:15.055
I'M JUST GONNA LIE ON THE COUCH
AND WATCH SOME TV.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.056
OKAY.

09:16.056 --> 09:17.227
OH!

09:17.227 --> 09:19.559
BEFORE YOU FIRE UP
THE GOLF CHANNEL,

09:19.559 --> 09:22.132
YOU THINK MAYBE
YOU COULD MAKE A QUICK RUN

09:22.132 --> 09:24.564
TO THE GROCERY STORE?
 I'M TIRED. CAN'T YOU DO IT?

09:24.564 --> 09:26.566
I'M A LITTLE BUSY RIGHT NOW.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.568
I'VE GOT FIVE KIDS
AND A USELESS HOUSEGUEST.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.569
HI THERE.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.071
(groans)

09:31.071 --> 09:33.073
I NEED YOU FUNCTIONAL.

09:33.073 --> 09:35.175
EITHER GO TO THE DOCTOR
AND GET SOME HELP

09:35.175 --> 09:37.077
OR QUIT COMPLAINING
AND GIVE ME SOME HELP.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.949
FINE. I'LL GO TOMORROW.

09:38.949 --> 09:42.152
MAN, THE SYMPATHY IN HERE
IS JUST OVERWHELMING.

09:42.152 --> 09:45.055
(scoffs)

09:45.055 --> 09:46.617
WHAT?

09:46.617 --> 09:48.989
NOTHING.
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.220
(mouths word)

09:50.220 --> 09:51.622
BUT...

09:51.622 --> 09:53.624
YOU MAY WANNA BE CAREFUL.

09:53.624 --> 09:56.126
YOU TWO ARE STARTING TO SOUND
A LOT LIKE ME AND DOUG.

09:56.126 --> 09:59.670
I APPRECIATE THE CONCERN,
BUT TOM AND I ALWAYS DO THAT.

09:59.670 --> 10:01.972
DOUG AND I ALWAYS
DID THAT, TOO.

10:01.972 --> 10:03.273
LOOK AT US NOW.

10:03.273 --> 10:05.605
I'M TELLING YOU, WE'RE FINE.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.138
(mouths words)

10:08.138 --> 10:10.610
IF YOU SAY SO.

10:10.610 --> 10:11.882
(whispers) GOOD.

10:13.283 --> 10:15.285
THE DOCTORS SAY
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.

10:15.285 --> 10:17.648
THEY'RE ONLY KEEPING HER
IN THE HOSPITAL AS A PRECAUTION.

10:17.648 --> 10:19.820
SHE'LL BE HOME
IN A FEW DAYS.
 OH, THANK GOD.

10:19.820 --> 10:22.192
WELL, LOOK WHO'S HERE.

10:22.192 --> 10:25.025
CAN WE PLEASE NOT HAVE
ANOTHER UGLY SCENE?

10:25.025 --> 10:27.798
I ONLY CAME
TO CHECK ON JUANITA.
 SHE'S FINE.

10:27.798 --> 10:28.959
FANTASTIC.

10:28.959 --> 10:31.001
SO I SEE YOU LET
OUR TOMATO PLANTS WHITHER...

10:31.001 --> 10:33.003
JUST LIKE YOU DID
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

10:33.003 --> 10:36.066
WELL, THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN
YOU GROW NEEDY, WHINY TOMATOES.

10:36.066 --> 10:38.068
BOYS, BOYS, IT'S BEEN A MONTH.

10:38.068 --> 10:41.812
CAN'T YOU JUST KISS EACH OTHER'S
BOTTOMS AND MAKE UP?

10:41.812 --> 10:43.744
ISN'T THAT WHAT THEY DO?

10:43.744 --> 10:45.415
(footsteps approaching)

10:45.415 --> 10:47.247
WHO IS THAT?

10:49.649 --> 10:52.082
SHE LOOKS LOST.

10:52.082 --> 10:55.285
SHOULD WE HELP HER?

10:55.285 --> 10:57.858
AAH! SON OF A BITCH!

10:57.858 --> 11:00.390
WE SHOULD HELP HER.
 SON OF A...

11:00.390 --> 11:02.292
OH! OH!

11:02.292 --> 11:04.194
(panting)

11:04.194 --> 11:07.037
MISS, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

11:07.037 --> 11:09.039
NO. (sighs)

11:09.039 --> 11:12.402
I AM SO LOST.

11:12.402 --> 11:14.404
I GAVE THE CAB DRIVER
THE ADDRESS,

11:14.404 --> 11:16.376
BUT I ONLY HAD A $20,
AND IT TURNS OUT

11:16.376 --> 11:19.149
THAT ONLY GETS YOU AS FAR
AS HIBISCUS CIRCLE,

11:19.149 --> 11:20.811
SO HE DUMPED ME,

11:20.811 --> 11:22.813
AND I HAD TO WALK
IN THESE SHOES, WHICH BROKE,

11:22.813 --> 11:25.015
AND THAT IS THE LAST TIME
I AM BUYING FOOTWEAR

11:25.015 --> 11:27.357
OVER THE INTERNET.
 UH, WERE YOU LOOKING
FOR WISTERIA LANE?

11:27.357 --> 11:29.119
YEAH, THAT SOUNDS RIGHT.

11:29.119 --> 11:31.161
IS MY FISH MOVING?

11:31.161 --> 11:34.024
IF HE GOES BELLY-UP, THIS IS
GOING TO BE THE WORST DAY EVER.

11:34.024 --> 11:36.366
WHO IS IT
YOU'RE HERE TO SEE?

11:36.366 --> 11:38.729
UH, PAUL YOUNG.

11:38.729 --> 11:41.031
REALLY?
A-ARE YOU A FRIEND OF HIS?

11:41.031 --> 11:42.903
W-WELL...

11:42.903 --> 11:44.704
BETH!

11:44.704 --> 11:49.039
OH! I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA
BE HERE HOURS AGO.

11:49.039 --> 11:53.113
WELL... I SEE YOU'VE ALL MET
MY WIFE.

12:05.756 --> 12:07.097
(gasps)

12:07.097 --> 12:10.000
(clears throat)

12:10.000 --> 12:12.362
SORRY, IT GOT...
REALLY HOT IN HERE,

12:12.362 --> 12:15.305
AND I THOUGHT YOU'D BE GONE
FOR A WHILE.

12:15.305 --> 12:17.467
SO HOW IS JUANITA?
IS SHE OKAY?

12:17.467 --> 12:20.841
UM, SHE'S DOING MUCH BETTER.

12:20.841 --> 12:22.913
THANK YOU FOR ASKING.

12:22.913 --> 12:24.915
THANK GOD.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

12:24.915 --> 12:27.948
UM, ME? I'M OKAY.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.449
HOW'S THE WORK COMING?

12:29.449 --> 12:31.181
PRETTY GOOD.

12:31.181 --> 12:33.954
JUST GETTING READY
TO PUT, UH... (chuckles)

12:33.954 --> 12:36.056
SHOOT. IT'S ON BACKWARDS.

12:38.228 --> 12:39.389
(clears throat)

12:39.389 --> 12:40.791
BREE?

12:43.193 --> 12:44.764
YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY?

12:44.764 --> 12:46.236
I'M FINE. FINE.

12:46.236 --> 12:49.870
IT'S JUST BEEN A VERY...
STRESSFUL DAY.

12:49.870 --> 12:53.503
I THINK
I KNOW WHAT YOU NEED.

12:57.547 --> 12:59.349
IT'S OKAY.

12:59.349 --> 13:01.381
HITTING THAT LITTLE GIRL
WAS AN ACCIDENT.

13:01.381 --> 13:04.354
IT COULD'VE HAPPENED TO ANYONE.

13:04.354 --> 13:06.186
I HAVE TO LET YOU GO!

13:06.186 --> 13:07.487
HUH?

13:07.487 --> 13:10.861
AFTER YOU LET ME GO.
EVERYONE SHOULD JUST LET GO!

13:14.825 --> 13:16.396
ARE YOU FIRING ME?

13:16.396 --> 13:17.567
WHY?

13:17.567 --> 13:19.069
YOU'RE TOO MESSY.

13:19.069 --> 13:21.401
YOUR TOOLS--
THEY'RE SCATTERED EVERYWHERE.

13:21.401 --> 13:25.505
WELL, THIS IS
 A CONSTRUCTION SITE.
 AND YOU'RE GETTING PAINT
ALL OVER THE PLACE.

13:25.505 --> 13:28.038
AND THAT COLOGNE OF YOURS--
IT'S OVERPOWERING.

13:28.038 --> 13:30.210
I DON'T WEAR COLOGNE.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.912
THAT'S JUST YOU?

13:31.912 --> 13:32.943
OH, DEAR.

13:32.943 --> 13:34.244
ANYWAY, OBVIOUSLY...

13:34.244 --> 13:36.216
(bottles clink and rattle)

13:36.216 --> 13:39.249
I WILL PAY YOU
FOR THE TIME YOU'VE PUT IN,

13:39.249 --> 13:42.252
BUT I THINK YOU SHOULD GO.
 YOU CAN... SEND ME A CHECK.

13:45.355 --> 13:49.099
(door opens and closes)

13:49.099 --> 13:51.261
BYE, GUYS. (chuckles)

13:51.261 --> 13:53.003
HAVE A GREAT DAY.

13:53.003 --> 13:54.034
MWAH.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.036
HEY, AREN'T YOU GOING
TO WORK?

13:56.036 --> 13:58.038
OH, MY FIRST CLASS
ISN'T TILL 11:00.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.440
I THOUGHT I'D SPEND THE MORNING
MAKING MORE JEWELRY.

14:00.440 --> 14:03.113
WOW, YOU REALLY ARE DETERMINED
TO BRING IN SOME EXTRA MONEY.

14:03.113 --> 14:05.175
(chuckles) YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

14:05.175 --> 14:07.147
(sighs)

14:09.019 --> 14:10.150
(sighs)

14:10.150 --> 14:11.851
(beep)

14:28.198 --> 14:30.600
AND YOU DON'T LET ME
PUT MY FEET ON THAT TABLE.

14:30.600 --> 14:33.273
MIKE! UH, WHAT ARE YOU--WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HOME SO QUICK?

14:33.273 --> 14:35.605
I FORGOT MY THERMOS.
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

14:35.605 --> 14:37.147
UH...

14:37.147 --> 14:40.050
UH, I WAS, UH, JUST--
JUST DOING HOUSEWORK...

14:40.050 --> 14:42.082
(chuckles) O-OBVIOUSLY,

14:42.082 --> 14:44.454
AND, UH, THE AIR CONDITIONING
ISN'T WORKING,

14:44.454 --> 14:46.886
SO IT GOT REALLY HOT
IN HERE.

14:48.158 --> 14:50.020
I'LL SAY.

14:50.020 --> 14:51.321
MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

14:51.321 --> 14:53.423
NO! NO! UH...

14:53.423 --> 14:54.594
OH!

14:54.594 --> 14:56.596
UH... (laughs)
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:56.596 --> 14:58.428
WHY DON'T WE TAKE THIS
IN THE BEDROOM?

14:58.428 --> 15:00.931
WHAT'S WRONG WITH RIGHT HERE?

15:00.931 --> 15:02.672
(grunts) I AM ONE LUCKY GUY...

15:02.672 --> 15:04.134
(grunts)

15:04.134 --> 15:07.207
TO COME HOME
TO A HOT FANTASY LIKE THIS.

15:07.207 --> 15:10.640
YEP. (grunts)
AND I AM ONE LUCKY GIRL

15:10.640 --> 15:14.014
TO HAVE A...
HAVE A HUSBAND LIKE...

15:15.185 --> 15:17.017
(grunts)

15:17.017 --> 15:20.220
YOU. OHH.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.122
(pants) OHH.

15:24.494 --> 15:26.496
ANY LUCK FINDING
AN APARTMENT?

15:26.496 --> 15:28.498
NOT WITH MY SETTLEMENT.
WITH NEW YORK PRICES,

15:28.498 --> 15:32.062
I'LL BE FORCED TO LIVE
IN A PLACE SMALLER THAN THIS.

15:32.062 --> 15:35.405
OH, MY GOD. HOW WILL YOU KEEP
FROM BUMPING INTO YOURSELF?

15:35.405 --> 15:37.507
YOU KNOW WHAT I WAS THINKING?

15:37.507 --> 15:40.140
WHY DON'T I JUST
FIND A PLACE HERE IN FAIRVIEW?

15:40.140 --> 15:42.472
(dishes clatter)

15:42.472 --> 15:44.274
FAIRVIEW?

15:44.274 --> 15:45.945
UH... NO.

15:45.945 --> 15:47.247
(laughs) NO, NO!

15:47.247 --> 15:51.151
YOU'RE A NEW YORKER.
YOU LOVE THE THEATER, MUSEUMS.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.652
YOU SAID YOURSELF,

15:52.652 --> 15:55.025
YOU CAN'T EVEN GET A DECENT
CUP OF COFFEE AROUND HERE.

15:55.025 --> 15:57.027
UH, NO, I MEANT HERE,
 LYNETTE.

15:57.027 --> 15:59.159
REALLY, HOW HARD IS IT
TO CLEAN THE POT?

16:02.162 --> 16:05.495
HEY!
HOW'D IT GO WITH THE DOCTOR?

16:05.495 --> 16:09.169
YEAH, CAN, UH, WE, UM...

16:09.169 --> 16:11.271
TALK ABOUT THAT?

16:11.271 --> 16:14.044
SO WHAT DID THE DOCTOR SAY?

16:14.044 --> 16:16.346
YOU'RE GONNA WANNA SIT DOWN.

16:16.346 --> 16:19.679
TOM, YOU ARE SCARING ME.
WHAT IS IT?

16:19.679 --> 16:22.152
(exhales deeply)

16:22.152 --> 16:26.586
I HAVE
POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION.

16:26.586 --> 16:28.418
COME AGAIN?

16:28.418 --> 16:31.361
I KNOW IT SOUNDS WEIRD,
B-BUT IT'S--IT'S--

16:31.361 --> 16:34.394
IT'S A RECOGNIZED PROBLEM
FOR FATHERS MY AGE.

16:34.394 --> 16:37.127
I'VE GOT
ALL THE CLASSIC SYMPTOMS--

16:37.127 --> 16:39.269
HEADACHES, MOOD SWINGS,

16:39.269 --> 16:40.470
FATIGUE.

16:40.470 --> 16:42.272
WOW.

16:42.272 --> 16:45.275
TELL ME, DID HE CHECK YOU
FOR A YEAST INFECTION

16:45.275 --> 16:47.777
WHILE HE WAS DOWN THERE,
TOO?

16:47.777 --> 16:52.612
WHY DON'T YOU LEARN THE FACTS
BEFORE YOU MAKE FUN OF IT?

16:52.612 --> 16:55.115
"MEN AND POSTPARTUM:

16:55.115 --> 16:57.587
THE BITTER SEED."

16:57.587 --> 17:00.190
YEAH, I'M... NOT BUYING IT.

17:00.190 --> 17:02.492
SHOW ME ONE STRETCH MARK,
ONE CHAPPED NIPPLE,

17:02.492 --> 17:04.493
AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT
YOUR POSTPARTUM.

17:04.493 --> 17:06.296
IT'S A LEGITIMATE
MEDICAL CONDITION.

17:06.296 --> 17:09.299
AND YOU'RE THE ONE WHO TOLD ME
TO GO TO THE DOCTOR.

17:09.299 --> 17:11.300
SO YOU COULD BE OF SOME USE
AROUND HERE,

17:11.300 --> 17:13.262
NOT SO YOU COULD, UH...

17:13.262 --> 17:16.205
OH, "TAKE LONG BATHS
OR GET IN SOME EXTRA NAPS"?

17:16.205 --> 17:18.238
DO ME A FAVOR.
READ THE WHOLE PAMPHLET.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.239
(baby crying)

17:19.239 --> 17:21.241
GOSH, I WISH I COULD, TOM.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.243
UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE TO GO
TAKE CARE OF MY OTHER BABY.

17:24.243 --> 17:27.247
(crying continues)

17:41.591 --> 17:44.594
(clock chiming)

17:57.207 --> 17:58.848
I LOVE THE HOUSE.

17:58.848 --> 18:02.352
OH. WELL,
I DID THE BEST I COULD.

18:02.352 --> 18:04.314
I THINK IT NEEDS
A WOMAN'S TOUCH.

18:04.314 --> 18:05.515
OH.

18:05.515 --> 18:08.818
I-I DON'T HAVE MUCH EXPERIENCE
WITH DECORATING.

18:08.818 --> 18:12.222
IF I SO MUCH AS MOVED A CHAIR,
MAMA WOULD THROW A FIT.

18:12.222 --> 18:16.166
MM, THEN YOU MUST BE HAPPY
TO FINALLY HAVE YOUR OWN HOME.

18:16.166 --> 18:18.268
I GUESS.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.771
(utensil clatters)

18:21.771 --> 18:23.333
LOOK AT THIS--

18:23.333 --> 18:24.674
NO PLEXIGLAS.

18:24.674 --> 18:27.277
I NEVER DREAMED
THE DAY WOULD COME

18:27.277 --> 18:29.439
WHEN I COULD REACH OUT
AND TOUCH YOU.

18:31.281 --> 18:33.213
I DIDN'T EITHER.

18:37.687 --> 18:40.250
THERE IS ONE THING
I'LL MISS ABOUT PRISON--

18:40.250 --> 18:41.851
YOUR LETTERS.

18:41.851 --> 18:44.854
SOME DAYS, THEY WERE THE ONLY
THINGS KEEPING ME GOING.

18:44.854 --> 18:47.857
I'M GLAD YOU LIKED THEM.

18:47.857 --> 18:51.361
UH, THANK YOU AGAIN
FOR GOING TO SO MUCH TROUBLE.

18:51.361 --> 18:53.163
DINNER IS WONDERFUL.

18:53.163 --> 18:55.335
I WANTED TONIGHT
TO BE SPECIAL.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.337
SINCE THE PRISON DIDN'T
ALLOW CONJUGAL VISITS,

18:57.337 --> 18:59.209
THIS IS... KIND OF
OUR WEDDING NIGHT.

19:01.311 --> 19:03.473
ABOUT THAT..

19:03.473 --> 19:06.676
I CAN'T WAIT
TO START COOKING FOR YOU

19:06.676 --> 19:08.878
AND MAKING THINGS NICE
AROUND HERE,

19:08.878 --> 19:11.851
BUT THERE ARE
CERTAIN OTHER...

19:11.851 --> 19:16.686
WIFELY DUTIES THAT
I DON'T WANT TO RUSH INTO.

19:16.686 --> 19:19.229
OH?

19:19.229 --> 19:21.791
WE'RE STILL
GETTING TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

19:21.791 --> 19:24.364
MAMA SAID YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.368
OH, I SUPPOSE I DO.

19:28.368 --> 19:30.300
YOU'RE NOT UPSET?

19:30.300 --> 19:32.572
OF COURSE NOT.

19:32.572 --> 19:34.904
THERE'S MORE TO MARRIAGE
THAN SEX.

19:38.248 --> 19:40.350
(woman speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

19:40.350 --> 19:44.584
OH, MRS. SOLIS,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

19:44.584 --> 19:47.287
IF THIS IS ABOUT JUANITA
AND THE DESSERT CART,

19:47.287 --> 19:49.589
I TOLD YOU NOT TO LEAVE IT
UNATTENDED.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.591
NO, I WAS REVIEWING
HER CHART,

19:51.591 --> 19:53.593
AND I REALIZED WE STILL HAD
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

19:53.593 --> 19:57.227
IS SHE ALLERGIC
TO ANY MEDICATIONS?
 UH, NOT THAT I'M AWARE OF.

19:57.227 --> 19:59.729
OKAY. ALL HER VACCINATIONS
UP-TO-DATE?
 YES.

19:59.729 --> 20:02.602
AND HOW OLD WAS SHE
WHEN YOU ADOPTED HER?

20:02.602 --> 20:05.735
(laughs)

20:05.735 --> 20:07.737
I KNOW IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

20:07.737 --> 20:10.209
THAT THE LITTLE ACORN
GAVE BIRTH TO THE MIGHTY OAK,

20:10.209 --> 20:12.211
BUT BELIEVE ME, I DID.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.643
OKAY.

20:13.643 --> 20:15.645
MAYBE I'M CONFUSED,
BUT THE OTHER DAY

20:15.645 --> 20:18.348
WHEN WE TALKED ABOUT
POSSIBLE BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS,

20:18.348 --> 20:20.950
YOU TOLD ME YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND
WERE TYPE-O.

20:20.950 --> 20:22.692
YEAH, WE ARE.

20:22.692 --> 20:24.254
SO?

20:24.254 --> 20:28.358
W-WELL, YOUR DAUGHTER IS TYPE-A.
TWO O's CAN'T HAVE AN "A."

20:29.859 --> 20:32.231
OH.

20:33.663 --> 20:35.405
NEVER MIND.

20:35.405 --> 20:39.269
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. WHAT...
(scoffs) WHAT WAS THAT?

20:39.269 --> 20:41.271
WHAT WAS THAT
"OH. NEVER MIND"?

20:41.271 --> 20:43.943
IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.276
NO, NO, TELL ME.
WHAT ARE YOU IMPLYING?

20:46.276 --> 20:47.617
NOTHING.

20:47.617 --> 20:50.480
I'M SIMPLY STATING THAT
THE ODDS OF MR. SOLIS BEING

20:50.480 --> 20:52.982
THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER
OF A TYPE-A BABY

20:52.982 --> 20:55.625
ARE ROUGHLY...
(clicks tongue) NIL.

20:55.625 --> 20:58.328
ARE YOU SUGGESTING
I CHEATED ON HIM?

20:58.328 --> 21:00.590
I'M SIMPLY STATING THAT
THE ODDS OF MR. SOLIS BEING

21:00.590 --> 21:02.592
THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER ARE--
 LISTEN, NURSIE.

21:02.592 --> 21:04.594
I KNOW YOU SPEND YOUR DAYS
EMPTYING BEDPANS

21:04.594 --> 21:06.536
AND SHAVING THE GROINS
OF SENIOR CITIZENS,

21:06.536 --> 21:08.838
BUT THERE'S NO DRAMA HERE.

21:08.838 --> 21:10.840
I'VE BEEN FAITHFUL
TO MY HUSBAND.

21:10.840 --> 21:13.303
I HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE.

21:19.008 --> 21:20.910
GIVE ME THAT.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.986
AH.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.658
GOOD MORNING.

21:28.658 --> 21:30.059
(yawns) GOOD MORNING.

21:30.059 --> 21:32.291
DID YOU HAVE TROUBLE
SLEEPING?

21:32.291 --> 21:35.325
AH, I WAS UP KINDA LATE.

21:35.325 --> 21:37.927
BOY, THAT TOM SURE CAN TALK.

21:40.630 --> 21:43.032
YOU WERE UP WITH TOM?

21:43.032 --> 21:46.376
HUH? OH. YEAH. I GUESS
HE HAD A LOT ON HIS MIND.

21:46.376 --> 21:51.080
NO SURPRISE AFTER THE WAY THINGS
WENT BETWEEN YOU TWO YESTERDAY.

21:51.080 --> 21:53.312
HE WAS COMPLAINING
ABOUT THAT?

21:53.312 --> 21:55.685
OH, I DON'T WANT
TO GET IN THE MIDDLE.

21:55.685 --> 21:58.317
HONEY, YOU HAD A PAJAMA PARTY
WITH MY HUSBAND

21:58.317 --> 22:00.390
AT 3:00 IN THE MORNING.

22:00.390 --> 22:02.392
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE.

22:02.392 --> 22:03.723
WELL... (sighs)

22:03.723 --> 22:07.026
TOM FEELS
THAT YOU DON'T LISTEN TO HIM.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.428
OY.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.929
G--SURE I DO.

22:09.929 --> 22:12.432
I HEARD THAT WHOLE SPIEL
ABOUT MALE POSTPARTUM,

22:12.432 --> 22:14.434
OTHERWISE KNOWN BY
ITS INITIALS--B.S.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.065
SEE, THAT'S JUST THE THING.

22:16.065 --> 22:18.838
HE THINKS YOU HEAR,
BUT YOU DON'T LISTEN.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.009
OKAY.

22:20.009 --> 22:22.572
OKAY, YOU STOP.

22:22.572 --> 22:24.774
I DON'T NEED YOU
TROUBLESHOOTING MY MARRIAGE.

22:24.774 --> 22:26.776
AND I DON'T WANT YOU
HAVING ANY MORE

22:26.776 --> 22:28.778
OF THESE LITTLE CONVERSATIONS
WITH MY HUSBAND.

22:28.778 --> 22:30.119
OKAY. FINE.

22:31.621 --> 22:33.483
(mouths words)

22:33.483 --> 22:34.984
AND I MEAN IT.

22:37.687 --> 22:39.559
(sighs)

22:39.559 --> 22:42.562
(exhales deeply)

22:45.865 --> 22:47.937
THERE YOU ARE!
I CALLED YOU AN HOUR AGO!

22:47.937 --> 22:49.599
I WAS AT SCHOOL.

22:49.599 --> 22:53.042
HI, SWEETIE! THE KIDS
IN YOUR CLASS MADE YOU A POSTER.

22:53.042 --> 22:56.446
LOOK WHAT BRITTANY SAID.
 YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
SHE LOVES IT. COME ON!

22:56.446 --> 22:57.947
COME ON!

23:00.850 --> 23:02.081
OOH! OOH!

23:02.081 --> 23:04.083
OH! WHAT IS GOING ON?!

23:04.083 --> 23:05.455
OKAY.

23:05.455 --> 23:07.457
DO YOU REMEMBER
EIGHT YEARS AGO

23:07.457 --> 23:09.819
WHEN WE WENT
ON THAT SKI WEEKEND?

23:09.819 --> 23:11.991
UH... (scoffs) VAGUELY.

23:11.991 --> 23:13.993
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!
IT CAN'T BE "VAGUELY."

23:13.993 --> 23:16.065
I NEED YOU TO FOCUS.
 OH! OH! OKAY.

23:16.065 --> 23:17.597
OKAY.

23:17.597 --> 23:20.700
REMEMBER HOW YOU AND I HAD
DINNER WITH THAT FRENCH GUY?

23:20.700 --> 23:23.102
THE ONE YOU REFERRED TO
AS LE PACKAGE?

23:23.102 --> 23:24.474
EXACTLY.

23:24.474 --> 23:26.976
OKAY. TELL ME EVERYTHING
YOU REMEMBER.

23:28.638 --> 23:31.981
OOH! I REMEMBER I HAD THE FONDUE
AND I LOST MY STRAWBERRY,

23:31.981 --> 23:34.984
AND THE WAITER ALMOST
CAUGHT ME WHEN I PUT MY--

23:34.984 --> 23:37.847
I'M TALKING ABOUT
ME AND THE PACKAGE!

23:37.847 --> 23:40.850
WHY ARE YOU YELLING AT ME?
 'CAUSE I'M MAD!
YOU WENT OFF TO BED

23:40.850 --> 23:43.192
AND LEFT ME AND FRENCHIE
DRINKING AT THE HOTEL BAR,

23:43.192 --> 23:45.424
AND FRIENDS DON'T LET
FRIENDS FLIRT DRUNK!

23:45.424 --> 23:47.527
NOW FOR THE LOVE OF GOD,

23:47.527 --> 23:50.530
DO YOU AT LEAST REMEMBER
WHEN I CAME BACK TO THE ROOM?

23:50.530 --> 23:52.061
(sighs)

23:52.061 --> 23:54.534
I REMEMBER
THE SUN WAS COMING UP.

23:54.534 --> 23:56.165
OH, GOD.

23:56.165 --> 23:58.107
GABY, YOU'RE NOT SAYING...

23:58.107 --> 24:00.510
YEAH.

24:00.510 --> 24:03.513
(voice breaks) I THINK
JUANITA MIGHT BE FRENCH.

24:03.513 --> 24:04.814
(gasps)

24:12.982 --> 24:15.485
WHEN CARLOS RETURNED
FROM HIS BUSINESS TRIP.

24:15.485 --> 24:17.987
HE STOPPED AT THE HOSPITAL
TO VISIT HIS DAUGHTER,

24:17.987 --> 24:21.190
WHO HAD BEEN SLEEPING
PEACEFULLY.

24:21.190 --> 24:24.463
THEN HE CAME HOME
TO SEE HIS WIFE,

24:24.463 --> 24:27.466
WHO HAD BEEN PLOTTING
FRANTICALLY.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.971
(sighs)

24:35.074 --> 24:37.076
(groans)

24:37.076 --> 24:39.148
(grunts)

24:45.114 --> 24:49.088
(groaning)

24:49.088 --> 24:50.760
(grunts)

24:50.760 --> 24:52.892
OH, YOU'RE AWAKE. (groans)

24:52.892 --> 24:55.094
MM.

24:55.094 --> 24:58.898
(sighs)

24:58.898 --> 25:01.971
MMM. YOU'RE REALLY AWAKE.

25:04.133 --> 25:06.105
MMM.

25:06.105 --> 25:08.678
(gasps)

25:08.678 --> 25:09.879
WHAT...

25:09.879 --> 25:11.881
CARLOS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

25:11.881 --> 25:15.715
ME? I JUST GOT INTO BED!
 YOU CLIMBED ON TOP OF ME.

25:15.715 --> 25:17.987
I DID?
 YEAH.

25:17.987 --> 25:20.149
YOU WERE KINDA MAKING OUT WITH
ME. NOT THAT I'M COMPLAINING.

25:20.149 --> 25:22.992
OH, NO.
IT'S HAPPENING AGAIN!

25:22.992 --> 25:25.024
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

25:25.024 --> 25:26.255
(sighs)

25:26.255 --> 25:27.857
MY SEXSOMNIA.

25:27.857 --> 25:30.229
YOUR WHAT?

25:30.229 --> 25:33.763
YEAH, IT'S LIKE SLEEPWALKING,
EXCEPT...

25:33.763 --> 25:37.136
INSTEAD OF USING YOUR LEGS,
YOU USE YOUR... YOU KNOW.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.670
SEXSOMNIA.

25:40.670 --> 25:42.672
IT'S REAL. LOOK IT UP.

25:42.672 --> 25:45.675
SINCE WHEN
HAVE YOU HAD THAT?

25:45.675 --> 25:48.177
(blows air) WELL, DEFINITELY
BEFORE THE GIRLS WERE BORN.

25:48.177 --> 25:50.279
I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU DO IT BEFORE.

25:50.279 --> 25:54.283
WELL, IT MOSTLY ONLY HAPPENS
WHEN I'M REALLY TIRED,

25:54.283 --> 25:56.155
LIKE WHEN I WORK OUT TOO MUCH

25:56.155 --> 25:58.287
OR GO SKIING.

25:58.287 --> 26:00.289
WELL,
THEN FIRST THING TOMORROW,

26:00.289 --> 26:02.331
I'M CHECKING OUT AIRFARE
TO ASPEN.

26:02.331 --> 26:05.264
NO! NO, NO, NO. IT'S NOT A JOKE.
IT'S DANGEROUS.

26:05.264 --> 26:07.266
IT DOESN'T MATTER
WHO I'M NEXT TO.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.298
I COULD HAVE SEX
AND NOT EVEN KNOW IT.

26:09.298 --> 26:11.100
WOW.

26:11.100 --> 26:13.302
WELL, SINCE YOU'RE UP...

26:13.302 --> 26:14.744
NO, I'M TOO TIRED...

26:14.744 --> 26:16.876
AND ASHAMED. GOOD NIGHT.

26:21.150 --> 26:23.152
HEY, I THOUGHT
I'D RETURN THIS.

26:23.152 --> 26:26.155
I BORROWED IT FROM ORSON
A WHILE BACK.
 OH. THANK YOU.

26:26.155 --> 26:28.117
SO WHERE'S
THAT CHIPPENDALE DANCER

26:28.117 --> 26:30.119
YOU HIRED TO FIX YOUR HOUSE?

26:30.119 --> 26:32.121
IF YOU MEAN MY CONTRACTOR,
HIS NAME IS KEITH,

26:32.121 --> 26:34.123
AND I HAD TO LET HIM GO.

26:34.123 --> 26:38.127
WHY? YOU CATCH HIM, UH,
GRATING CHEESE ON HIS ABS?

26:38.127 --> 26:41.370
IT JUST WASN'T WORKING OUT.

26:41.370 --> 26:43.372
(chuckles) MUST'VE BEEN
PRETTY BAD FOR YOU

26:43.372 --> 26:46.906
TO KICK THAT SHIRTLESS WONDER
OUT OF YOUR FRONT YARD.

26:46.906 --> 26:49.909
I WAS FINALLY REACHING
MY TARGET HEART RATE ON MY WALK.

26:49.909 --> 26:52.942
YOU MEAN AT YOUR AGE,
YOU STILL HAVE URGES TO--

26:52.942 --> 26:54.383
I'M NOT DEAD, BREE.

26:54.383 --> 26:57.146
I MAY LIKE MY BED
AND MY FOOD SOFT,

26:57.146 --> 27:00.920
BUT I LIKE MY MEN--
 OKAY. OKAY. JUST CURIOUS.

27:00.920 --> 27:02.251
MM.

27:02.251 --> 27:05.154
(sighs)
I GUESS I WAS HOPING...

27:05.154 --> 27:07.296
HOPING WHAT?

27:07.296 --> 27:10.229
THAT ONE DAY
I MIGHT OUTGROW ALL THIS.

27:10.229 --> 27:13.302
AH, THAT'S WHY
YOU FIRED KEITH.

27:13.302 --> 27:16.635
I JUST CAN'T HAVE HIM AROUND.
HE'S TOO DISTRACTING.

27:16.635 --> 27:19.268
AND I REFUSE
TO MAKE A FOOL OF MYSELF.

27:19.268 --> 27:20.970
AND HOW WOULD THAT HAPPEN?

27:20.970 --> 27:22.972
WELL, LET ME RUN THE NUMBERS
FOR YOU.

27:22.972 --> 27:24.974
MY MARRIAGE ENDED
SIX DAYS AGO,

27:24.974 --> 27:27.046
KEITH IS 15 YEARS TOO YOUNG
FOR ME,

27:27.046 --> 27:29.048
AND MY TRACK RECORD
WITH LOVERS--

27:29.048 --> 27:31.721
TWO DEAD,
ONE IN A WHEELCHAIR.

27:31.721 --> 27:33.723
BREE, I CAN'T TELL YOU
HOW TO LIVE YOUR LIFE.

27:33.723 --> 27:36.425
ALL I KNOW IS THAT NOT LIVING
YOUR LIFE ISN'T THE ANSWER.

27:36.425 --> 27:40.229
I'VE JUST... NEVER BEEN
VERY GOOD AT TAKING RISKS.

27:40.229 --> 27:43.162
WELL, THEN GET GOOD,
BECAUSE TAKE MY WORD FOR IT,

27:43.162 --> 27:46.896
ONCE THEY TURN INTO REGRETS,
IT'S TOO LATE.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.074
(TV playing indistinctly)
 OKAY.

27:55.074 --> 27:58.277
(pants) HI.

27:58.277 --> 28:01.050
DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO HELP
OR ANYTHING.

28:01.050 --> 28:02.211
COOL.

28:02.211 --> 28:03.382
OH.

28:03.382 --> 28:06.115
WHERE'S YOUR DAD?
HIS CAR'S GONE.

28:06.115 --> 28:08.687
UH, HE AND RENEE
WENT OUT TO DINNER.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.860
(bag thuds)
 HE AND RENEE?

28:10.860 --> 28:13.292
YEAH. THEY WENT TO THAT
FRENCH RESTAURANT DAD LIKES.

28:13.292 --> 28:15.294
THEY SAID YOU COULD JOIN THEM
IF YOU WANT.

28:15.294 --> 28:17.827
OH, I WANT.

28:17.827 --> 28:21.130
OKAY, YOU UNLOAD
THESE GROCERIES

28:21.130 --> 28:23.803
AND LOOK AFTER YOUR SISTER.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.775
NAH, I'VE GOT PLANS TONIGHT.

28:25.775 --> 28:27.777
I DON'T WANT
TO GET STUCK BABYSITTING.

28:27.777 --> 28:28.938
COOL.

28:28.938 --> 28:31.310
(sighs)

28:31.310 --> 28:32.441
(door closes)

28:32.441 --> 28:36.215
(indistinct conversations)

28:39.789 --> 28:42.792
(speaking inaudibly)

28:49.728 --> 28:50.960
HEY.

28:50.960 --> 28:53.202
HEY. GOOD,
YOU GOT THE MESSAGE.

28:53.202 --> 28:56.205
LOUD AND CLEAR.
SO YOU GUYS SURE LOOK LIKE

28:56.205 --> 28:58.167
YOU'RE DISCUSSING
SOMETHING HEAVY.

28:58.167 --> 29:00.209
AHEM. WHAT'S UP?

29:02.211 --> 29:05.274
TO BE HONEST,
I WAS TALKING ABOUT YOU...

29:07.116 --> 29:09.979
AND YOUR TENDENCY
TO BE CRITICAL,

29:09.979 --> 29:12.982
AND HOW FRUSTRATING IT IS
TO HAVE MY FEELINGS INVALIDATED

29:12.982 --> 29:15.985
WHENEVER I BRING UP
SOMETHING YOU DON'T LIKE.

29:15.985 --> 29:18.227
UH-HUH.

29:18.227 --> 29:21.290
RENEE, SIDEBAR.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.238
DID I
OR DID I NOT TELL YOU

29:29.238 --> 29:31.240
TO BUTT THE HELL
OUT OF MY MARRIAGE?

29:31.240 --> 29:32.541
WHAT DID I DO?

29:32.541 --> 29:35.374
I WAS JUST FINISHING MY DESSERT
AND LISTENING TO THE GUY TALK.

29:35.374 --> 29:38.447
"HOW FRUSTRATING IT IS TO HAVE
MY FEELINGS INVALIDATED"?

29:38.447 --> 29:43.282
THAT'S GOT YOUR $500-AN-HOUR
SHRINK WRITTEN ALL OVER IT.

29:43.282 --> 29:46.816
I WAS JUST TRYING TO HELP.
 THAT'S A LOAD OF CRAP.

29:46.816 --> 29:49.318
YOU NEED A PROJECT, AND SINCE
YOU'RE CURRENTLY WITHOUT

29:49.318 --> 29:51.320
A HOUSE TO REMODEL,
YOU'VE DECIDED

29:51.320 --> 29:53.362
TO PUT THE WRECKING BALL
TO MY MARRIAGE.

29:53.362 --> 29:56.325
OH, PLEASE.
 THIS IS WHAT YOU DO.

29:56.325 --> 29:59.328
YOU TAKE OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES
APART FOR YOUR OWN AMUSEMENT,

29:59.328 --> 30:02.201
AND THEN YOU GET THE FUN
OF PUTTING THEM BACK TOGETHER.

30:02.201 --> 30:04.333
WELL, I'M NOT LETTING YOU DO IT
THIS TIME.

30:04.333 --> 30:08.507
MY MARRIAGE
IS NOT SOME GUEST BATHROOM

30:08.507 --> 30:11.911
IN YOUR SUMMER HOUSE.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.913
FINE. LET'S JUST SAY
THAT YOU'RE RIGHT,

30:13.913 --> 30:15.915
AND I'M A TERRIBLE PERSON.

30:15.915 --> 30:18.918
BUT THERE'S STILL
A MAN IN THERE WHO IS IN PAIN,

30:18.918 --> 30:22.291
AND HIS WIFE WON'T LISTEN
TO HIM. THAT'S NOT MY DOING.

30:22.291 --> 30:24.593
I THINK THIS SIDEBAR
IS OVER.

30:40.209 --> 30:41.911
(keys jangle)

30:41.911 --> 30:44.213
(door unlocks)

30:44.213 --> 30:46.045
HEY, SUSAN?

30:46.045 --> 30:47.216
HEY. (chuckles)

30:47.216 --> 30:51.050
OH, THOSE ARE BEAUTIFUL.
WHAT'S THE OCCASION?

30:51.050 --> 30:52.521
I CALLED THE BANK

30:52.521 --> 30:55.885
TO SEE IF THEY WOULD GIVE US
AN EXTENSION ON OUR CAR PAYMENT,

30:55.885 --> 30:58.387
AND THE GUY TOLD ME
YOU ALREADY PAID IT.

30:58.387 --> 31:02.161
HAD A GOOD WEEK
WITH MY JEWELRY. (chuckles)

31:02.161 --> 31:03.362
YOU'RE AMAZING.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.463
YOU TEACH,

31:04.463 --> 31:07.396
YOU BUST YOUR ASS
WITH THIS JEWELRY BUSINESS,

31:07.396 --> 31:09.398
AND I COME HOME YESTERDAY,

31:09.398 --> 31:11.400
AND HERE YOU ARE,
AS HAPPY AS CAN BE,

31:11.400 --> 31:13.472
WORKING TO MAKE THIS PLACE
A HOME.

31:13.472 --> 31:16.275
I'M SO LUCKY
TO HAVE A WIFE LIKE YOU.

31:18.577 --> 31:20.279
MMM.

31:26.315 --> 31:28.187
(sighs)

31:30.059 --> 31:32.291
WOW. (chuckles)

31:32.291 --> 31:33.592
THERE YA GO.

31:33.592 --> 31:35.394
THAT'S QUITE A HAUL.

31:35.394 --> 31:37.396
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE GETTIN' GOOD AS THIS.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.898
I DIDN'T THINK
THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

31:39.898 --> 31:43.602
I'M ALSO GETTING GOOD
AT LYING TO MY HUSBAND.

31:43.602 --> 31:47.476
I DIDN'T THINK
THAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN EITHER.

31:49.578 --> 31:52.581
(rock music playing)

31:59.248 --> 32:02.321
(billiard balls clack)

32:04.053 --> 32:06.095
HELLO, KEITH.

32:06.095 --> 32:08.157
(scoffs)

32:08.157 --> 32:09.498
HOW'D YOU FIND ME?

32:09.498 --> 32:13.262
YOU FOLLOW THE SCENT
OF MY NONEXISTENT COLOGNE?

32:13.262 --> 32:16.605
NO. YOUR ANSWERING SERVICE SAID
I MIGHT FIND YOU HERE.

32:20.069 --> 32:22.941
I WAS A LITTLE OUT OF SORTS
THE OTHER DAY,

32:22.941 --> 32:25.514
AND. UH, WELL,
LONG STORY SHORT,

32:25.514 --> 32:29.148
I WAS HOPING YOU'D CONSIDER
COMING BACK.

32:29.148 --> 32:32.651
(laughs)

32:34.523 --> 32:38.227
I'VE GOT A BUDDY,
LOVES SPORTS CARS.

32:38.227 --> 32:40.659
I TOLD HIM TO BUY
AN OLD PONTIAC G.T.O.

32:40.659 --> 32:43.292
THEY RUN GREAT,
THEY'RE EASY TO WORK ON.

32:43.292 --> 32:45.164
BUT HE BOUGHT A MASERATI.

32:45.164 --> 32:48.097
THE THING IS
ALWAYS IN THE SHOP,

32:48.097 --> 32:49.438
VERY TEMPERAMENTAL,

32:49.438 --> 32:52.101
REAL PAIN IN THE ASS.

32:53.702 --> 32:57.446
YOU SEEM LIKE
KIND OF A MASERATI TO ME.

33:01.150 --> 33:02.611
I'M NO MASERATI, KEITH.

33:02.611 --> 33:06.115
I'M A FAMILY SEDAN
WITH A BEIGE INTERIOR

33:06.115 --> 33:08.757
WHO'S GOING THROUGH
A DIVORCE.

33:08.757 --> 33:12.161
WELL, I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT,

33:12.161 --> 33:14.463
BUT I'M STILL GONNA PASS.

33:25.234 --> 33:26.705
I-I NEED YOU.

33:29.078 --> 33:31.380
YOU'VE SEEN MY HOUSE.
IT'S KIND OF A MESS.

33:31.380 --> 33:34.583
AND THE TRUTH IS, MY LIFE'S
KIND OF A MESS, TOO.

33:34.583 --> 33:36.585
AND WHEN YOU CAME IN

33:36.585 --> 33:39.418
WITH ALL YOUR ENERGY
AND YOUR WONDERFUL IDEAS,

33:39.418 --> 33:40.719
I STARTED FEELING LIKE

33:40.719 --> 33:45.294
MAYBE YOU WERE GONNA HELP ME
PUT IT ALL BACK TOGETHER...

33:45.294 --> 33:48.327
MY HOUSE, NOT MY LIFE.

33:48.327 --> 33:51.560
I JUST WANT YOU
TO WORK ON THE HOUSE.

33:55.364 --> 33:57.766
WOW.

33:57.766 --> 34:00.139
I REALLY DO SOUND LIKE
A MASERATI.

34:00.139 --> 34:01.410
UM...

34:04.113 --> 34:05.574
THANKS FOR LISTENING.

34:16.155 --> 34:17.456
(seat belt clicks)

34:19.458 --> 34:21.159
(Keith) HEY!
 (brakes screech, thud)

34:21.159 --> 34:22.460
(whispers) OH, MY GOD.

34:22.460 --> 34:25.164
(normal voice) OH, MY GOD.
OH, MY GOD. (gasps)

34:25.164 --> 34:27.666
OH, MY GOD!
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

34:27.666 --> 34:30.438
I DIDN'T SEE YOU THERE.
 YOU'VE GOT GREAT LEGS.

34:30.438 --> 34:33.302
YOU EVER CONSIDER JUST
JOGGING FROM PLACE TO PLACE?

34:33.302 --> 34:35.474
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
BEHIND MY CAR?

34:35.474 --> 34:39.447
I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT YOU SAID. (pants)

34:39.447 --> 34:42.451
IT'D BE A SHAME IF WE DIDN'T
FINISH WHAT WE STARTED.

34:43.782 --> 34:47.656
ARE YOU SURE? IT'S A BIG JOB,
AND THE BOSS IS KINDA NUTTY.

34:47.656 --> 34:50.359
(panting)
I LOVE A CHALLENGE.

34:50.359 --> 34:51.520
(sighs)

34:51.520 --> 34:54.563
NOW CAN I GET
YOUR INSURANCE INFORMATION?

34:54.563 --> 34:56.764
(laughs)

34:59.568 --> 35:03.172
(door closes)

35:03.172 --> 35:05.674
SO...

35:05.674 --> 35:08.337
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

35:08.337 --> 35:11.109
WHAT'S THIS?
GENUINE CONCERN?

35:11.109 --> 35:13.282
NO ASKING IF
MY BREASTS FEEL SWOLLEN

35:13.282 --> 35:15.484
OR IF IT'S A HEAVY FLOW DAY?

35:15.484 --> 35:18.187
I KNOW
 I WAS DISMISSIVE BEFORE,

35:18.187 --> 35:20.849
AND I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

35:20.849 --> 35:24.193
I READ THE PAMPHLET,
AND IT ACTUALLY MADE SENSE.

35:24.193 --> 35:27.856
BECOMING A NEW DAD AT YOUR AGE
CAN BE PRETTY SCARY.

35:27.856 --> 35:30.799
I MEAN, JUST LOOKING
AT THAT LITTLE GIRL

35:30.799 --> 35:34.333
AND KNOWING YOU MIGHT NOT
BE AROUND FOR HER WEDDING...

35:34.333 --> 35:36.765
IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE HELPING ME?

35:36.765 --> 35:39.708
I'M SAYING IT'S REAL,
AND I GET IT.

35:39.708 --> 35:42.441
AND NOW IN ORDER
TO DEMONSTRATE THAT

35:42.441 --> 35:45.174
I AM A LOVING AND CARING WIFE,
I HAVE TWO OPTIONS.

35:45.174 --> 35:47.176
ONE, WE CAN HAVE A LONG,
SENSITIVE CONVERSATION

35:47.176 --> 35:50.819
ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS,
OR OPTION TWO...

35:55.184 --> 35:58.757
(laughs)

35:58.757 --> 36:00.759
MMM.

36:00.759 --> 36:04.493
AS MUCH I LIKE OPTION TWO,

36:04.493 --> 36:06.495
I THINK TONIGHT...

36:06.495 --> 36:08.637
I WANNA TALK.

36:08.637 --> 36:10.939
(whispers) OH.

36:10.939 --> 36:13.342
(normal voice) YOU GOT IT.

36:19.348 --> 36:20.849
WHAT--WHAT'S THAT?

36:20.849 --> 36:22.881
I GOT YOU
A LITTLE SOMETHING.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.383
OH. (chuckles)

36:31.189 --> 36:32.961
TRY IT ON.

36:35.394 --> 36:37.366
PAUL...

36:37.366 --> 36:39.828
THIS ISN'T...
REALLY MY STYLE.

36:39.828 --> 36:41.900
LET ME BE THE JUDGE OF THAT.

36:41.900 --> 36:45.734
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.
YOU SAID WE COULD TAKE IT SLOW.

36:45.734 --> 36:48.206
IT'S BEEN ALMOST A WEEK.
ISN'T THAT SLOW ENOUGH?

36:48.206 --> 36:50.379
TRY IT. MAYBE IT'LL
PUT YOU IN THE MOOD.

36:50.379 --> 36:52.481
IT WON'T.
 COME ON.

36:52.481 --> 36:53.842
PAUL, NO.

36:53.842 --> 36:57.446
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY THINK I
WOULD WEAR SOMETHING LIKE THIS?

37:00.949 --> 37:04.222
(drawer opens)

37:07.356 --> 37:08.857
WHAT ARE THOSE?

37:08.857 --> 37:10.859
THE LETTERS YOU SENT ME
IN PRISON.

37:10.859 --> 37:12.901
OH.

37:12.901 --> 37:14.303
READ THIS.

37:14.303 --> 37:16.865
PAUL, PLEASE DON'T GET UPSET--
 OUT LOUD.

37:20.008 --> 37:22.471
"I LONG FOR YOU
TO KISS MY NECK,

37:22.471 --> 37:25.714
TO WHISPER IN MY EAR
WHILE YOU UNBUTTON MY BLOUSE."

37:25.714 --> 37:27.346
GO ON.

37:27.346 --> 37:30.579
"AND THEN...

37:30.579 --> 37:32.551
"MAKE LOVE TO ME...

37:32.551 --> 37:34.483
ALL NIGHT LONG."

37:34.483 --> 37:35.984
DID YOU WRITE THESE?

37:35.984 --> 37:37.486
IT WAS A FANTASY.

37:37.486 --> 37:39.788
I NEVER THOUGHT
IT WOULD BE REAL.
 IT IS REAL.

37:39.788 --> 37:41.890
PAUL, PLEASE--
 WE'RE MARRIED NOW.
WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

37:41.890 --> 37:44.663
I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
STAY IN PRISON.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.698
I DIDN'T MEAN THAT.

37:49.698 --> 37:51.400
I'M SORRY.

37:57.706 --> 37:59.878
(sighs)

37:59.878 --> 38:03.582
IT'S NOT A SURPRISE TO ME
THAT YOU HAVE SOME ISSUES.

38:03.582 --> 38:06.785
I MEAN, YOU MARRIED A MAN
IN PRISON FOR MURDER.

38:06.785 --> 38:10.559
CLEARLY, YOU ARE
A DISTURBED YOUNG WOMAN.

38:10.559 --> 38:12.521
THE GOOD NEWS IS,

38:12.521 --> 38:14.623
I'M WILLING TO HELP YOU.

38:14.623 --> 38:17.926
ALL I ASK IN RETURN
IS FOR A LITTLE AFFECTION.

38:17.926 --> 38:20.429
DO YOU THINK
YOU CAN OFFER ME THAT?

38:22.871 --> 38:24.833
I'LL TRY.

38:24.833 --> 38:26.835
GOOD.

38:33.882 --> 38:36.345
I'M A PATIENT MAN, BETH.

38:36.345 --> 38:38.647
BUT JUST SO WE'RE CLEAR,

38:38.647 --> 38:41.450
I WON'T BE PATIENT FOREVER.

38:41.450 --> 38:42.751
(kisses)

38:55.904 --> 38:57.606
(door closes)

39:00.369 --> 39:02.411
DON'T WORRY.
I CLEANED THE POT.

39:03.572 --> 39:05.574
THE WAY THINGS
HAVE BEEN GOING LATELY,

39:05.574 --> 39:08.577
I'M NOT AS WORRIED ABOUT TASTE
AS I AM POISON.

39:08.577 --> 39:11.950
LOOK, WHAT YOU DID
WAS BORDERLINE EVIL.

39:11.950 --> 39:14.453
BUT YOU WERE RIGHT
TO MAKE ME TALK TO TOM,

39:14.453 --> 39:16.425
SO I THANK YOU
FOR BEING A GOOD FRIEND,

39:16.425 --> 39:18.827
AND DON'T EVER DO IT AGAIN.

39:18.827 --> 39:22.090
YOU'RE WELCOME. (laughs)

39:22.090 --> 39:24.533
YOU KNOW, WHEN I DON'T
FEEL LIKE KILLING YOU,

39:24.533 --> 39:27.766
I THINK I LIKE
HAVING YOU AROUND.

39:27.766 --> 39:31.369
GOOD TO KNOW SINCE I JUST RENTED
THE MOST CHARMING BUNGALOW

39:31.369 --> 39:34.943
RIGHT HERE ON WISTERIA LANE.

39:34.943 --> 39:36.805
YOU'RE KIDDING.

39:36.805 --> 39:38.477
EDIE'S OLD HOUSE?

39:38.477 --> 39:42.481
WOW, THAT IS SO...

39:42.481 --> 39:43.552
WONDERFUL?

39:43.552 --> 39:44.983
CLOSE.

39:44.983 --> 39:46.054
(sighs)

39:46.054 --> 39:48.687
(chuckles)
 (baby crying)

39:48.687 --> 39:51.059
UM, I-I'M TRYING
TO CALM THE BABY,

39:51.059 --> 39:53.462
BUT APPARENTLY I DON'T HAVE
THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT.

39:53.462 --> 39:55.464
DID YOU HEAR THE BIG NEWS?

39:55.464 --> 39:57.796
RENEE IS MOVING IN JUST
A STONE'S THROW AWAY FROM US.

39:57.796 --> 39:59.468
(baby continues crying)

39:59.468 --> 40:01.570
YOU DO KNOW THAT'S
JUST AN EXPRESSION, RIGHT?

40:01.570 --> 40:03.532
WE'LL SEE.
 (chuckles)

40:07.436 --> 40:09.438
DO YOU REALLY THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA

40:09.438 --> 40:11.409
FOR YOU TO MOVE HERE?

40:11.409 --> 40:13.411
OF COURSE.
IT'LL BE A NICE, FRESH START.

40:13.411 --> 40:16.114
PLUS I CAN BE CLOSE
TO MY DEAR FRIEND.

40:16.114 --> 40:18.116
(lowered voice)
IT'S JUST, UM...

40:20.489 --> 40:23.792
I WANNA BE SURE--
 TOM, THAT WAS
A MILLION YEARS AGO.

40:23.792 --> 40:27.556
IT DOESN'T MATTER. SHE CAN NEVER
KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN US.

40:32.461 --> 40:35.604
(telephone ringing in distance)

40:35.604 --> 40:37.606
HAVE YOU SEEN MY WIFE?

40:37.606 --> 40:40.469
YEAH, SHE'S IN THE CAFETERIA.
OH, WHILE I'VE GOT YOU,

40:40.469 --> 40:43.672
COULD I HAVE YOU SIGN
THESE RELEASE FORMS?

40:43.672 --> 40:46.515
THEN YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO TAKE JUANITA HOME.

40:46.515 --> 40:48.817
WHAT'S THIS TORN PAGE
ON HER CHART?

40:48.817 --> 40:52.150
LET'S JUST SAY YOUR WIFE
HAS A BIT OF A TEMPER.

40:52.150 --> 40:54.623
(sighs) WHAT HAPPENED?

40:54.623 --> 40:56.785
WELL,
IT'S NOT REALLY MY PLACE,

40:56.785 --> 40:59.488
BUT SHE DID HAVE
A STRONG REACTION

40:59.488 --> 41:02.531
WHEN I TOLD HER
YOUR DAUGHTER'S BLOOD TYPE.

41:02.531 --> 41:03.692
(elevator bell dings)

41:05.494 --> 41:07.696
GABY DID THIS?

41:07.696 --> 41:12.040
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.102
OH, CRAP.

41:14.102 --> 41:16.705
GABY, COME BACK HERE!

41:16.705 --> 41:18.707
IT'S NOT MY FAULT!
I HAVE A DISORDER!

41:18.707 --> 41:21.179
GABY, WE HAVE TO TALK!
 DAMN IT! AAH!

41:21.179 --> 41:23.051
GABY!

41:23.051 --> 41:26.214
SEE YOU IN ABOUT TWO SECONDS.
OKAY, HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED.

41:26.214 --> 41:28.216
IT WAS ON THAT SKI WEEKEND
EIGHT YEARS AGO.

41:28.216 --> 41:30.218
I DON'T NORMALLY
GO FOR FRENCH GUYS,

41:30.218 --> 41:33.191
BUT YOU KNOW HOW I GET
WHEN I DRINK TOO MUCH CHAMPAGNE.
 WHAT?

41:33.191 --> 41:36.164
WELL, I DIDN'T THINK I SLEPT
WITH HIM, BUT I MUST HAVE,

41:36.164 --> 41:40.028
BECAUSE WHY ELSE WOULD
OUR DAUGHTER HAVE TYPE-A BLOOD?

41:40.028 --> 41:43.201
YOU'RE NOT KILLING ME.
WHY AREN'T YOU KILLING ME?

41:45.604 --> 41:48.236
(sighs) BABY, COME WITH ME.

41:48.236 --> 41:51.279
THERE'S SOMETHING
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

41:53.241 --> 41:56.244
(speaking inaudibly)

42:00.048 --> 42:02.120
THERE ARE CERTAIN KINDS OF PAIN

42:02.120 --> 42:05.554
THAT CAN'T BE TREATED
IN A HOSPITAL,

42:05.554 --> 42:08.296
SO THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING
DO WHAT THEY CAN

42:08.296 --> 42:10.829
TO HEAL THEMSELVES.

42:13.001 --> 42:15.634
SOME CURE
THE ACHE OF LONELINESS

42:15.634 --> 42:19.738
BY MAKING NEW FRIENDS.

42:19.738 --> 42:22.971
SOME SOOTHE
THEIR EXCRUCIATING GUILT

42:22.971 --> 42:27.576
WITH AN INFUSION OF CASH.

42:27.576 --> 42:30.779
SOME ALLEVIATE
THEIR BURNING DESIRE

42:30.779 --> 42:35.323
WITH SMALL ACTS OF KINDNESS.

42:35.323 --> 42:37.025
BUT SADLY,

42:37.025 --> 42:40.689
THERE WILL ALWAYS BE THOSE
WHO CAN'T BEGIN TO HEAL...

42:42.560 --> 42:45.594
BECAUSE THEY REALIZE
THERE IS MORE PAIN

42:45.594 --> 42:48.566
YET TO COME.
