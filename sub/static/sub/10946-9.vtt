WEBVTT

00:00.300 --> 00:01.634
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:01.669 --> 00:04.403
I've been convincing
myself that we're good,

00:04.438 --> 00:05.848
but I'm not so sure right now.

00:05.868 --> 00:08.438
- Amy: We are good.
- Ty: Amy, listen to me. You've changed.

00:08.458 --> 00:10.710
- Amy: How have I changed?
- Ty: You're not the same girl.

00:10.744 --> 00:12.945
- Amy: So you miss Casey.
- Tim: Yeah, yeah, I do.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.613
Amy: Then what are you doing, dad?

00:14.648 --> 00:17.183
You were the one who told me
to fight for what you want.

00:17.217 --> 00:19.117
You know,
you wanting us to get back together

00:19.152 --> 00:20.919
might be one of the smarter
things you've done in a while.

00:20.953 --> 00:23.322
Ungh!

00:23.356 --> 00:25.757
Casey: You asked to get back
together with me! (Laughing)

00:25.792 --> 00:26.992
Tim: Good call on my part.

00:27.026 --> 00:28.294
(Laughing)

00:28.328 --> 00:30.563
Amy: You're hung over, you look terrible...

00:30.597 --> 00:32.564
Ty: Let's just say that
beer and business don't mix.

00:32.598 --> 00:34.667
Of all people, why did you call me?

00:34.701 --> 00:36.989
I just didn't really know who else to call.

00:39.305 --> 00:40.772
(Hooves thunder)

00:48.647 --> 00:50.949
(Hooves thunder)

00:57.189 --> 00:58.590
(Hooves plod heavily, horse pants)

01:01.093 --> 01:02.893
(Black horse snorts and whinnies)

01:05.531 --> 01:08.232
Will: How're you doing?

01:08.266 --> 01:10.234
(High-pitched whinnies)

01:12.303 --> 01:14.705
(ATV rumbles nearby)

01:20.245 --> 01:21.746
Matt:
(Yelling) You know you got fences down?

01:21.780 --> 01:23.714
Will: What?

01:23.749 --> 01:25.982
Those wild horses,
they're all over my land.

01:26.016 --> 01:27.517
Ate the grass.
There's nothing left for my cows.

01:27.552 --> 01:29.586
Oh, come on, Matt.

01:29.621 --> 01:31.888
No! It's all your fault, Will.
Encouraging them like you do!

01:31.922 --> 01:33.423
Will: I don't encourage them.

01:33.458 --> 01:36.059
But these horses have
been up here for years.

01:36.093 --> 01:38.895
Well, what do you call putting
hay out for them all winter, huh?

01:38.929 --> 01:40.830
Now, let me tell you something!
I'm pushing for that cull to happen.

01:40.865 --> 01:42.866
And when it does,

01:42.900 --> 01:45.601
those damn horses are
gonna be the first to go.

01:45.636 --> 01:47.436
Ain't nothing you can do to stop it.

01:47.471 --> 01:49.005
Is that right?

01:56.046 --> 01:58.180
(ATV rumbles away, Will coughs)

02:01.351 --> 02:03.319
(Birds chirp)

02:08.592 --> 02:09.892
(Dish and cutlery clanks)

02:11.662 --> 02:14.696
(Truck rumbles outside)

02:14.730 --> 02:17.032
(Truck rumbles to a halt)

02:21.871 --> 02:25.340
Joanna: Hey, dad!
Got your breakfast all ready.

02:25.374 --> 02:28.210
Will: That damn fool Matt Pincher,
you know what he's doing?

02:28.244 --> 02:30.078
He's gunning for my little horses!

02:30.113 --> 02:32.246
It's a good thing his dad's dead,

02:32.281 --> 02:34.816
because if he were alive he'd be
kicking him from here to Thursday.

02:34.850 --> 02:36.351
(Birds chirp in the silence)

02:41.857 --> 02:45.908
Oh, yeah? W-w-what's all this?

02:45.928 --> 02:48.729
I told you I'm gonna sell.

02:48.763 --> 02:50.664
Oh, this is a great day.

02:50.699 --> 02:53.968
Joanna: Listen, dad...

02:54.002 --> 02:56.704
Dad, I know this is hard.
It's hard for me too.

02:56.738 --> 02:58.806
Yeah, yeah, I know.
You got your reasons for wanting to go.

02:58.841 --> 03:01.008
I'm clear on that.

03:01.043 --> 03:03.311
I want you to come with me,
I told you that!

03:03.345 --> 03:05.546
Will: And I'm not leaving my house,
and I told you that.

03:05.580 --> 03:08.281
I'm not!

03:08.316 --> 03:10.517
Listen, dad.
This is the best step for both of us.

03:10.552 --> 03:12.185
Both of us?

03:12.220 --> 03:14.020
I don't know...

03:14.055 --> 03:15.922
I don't why it's so hard
for you to understand,

03:15.957 --> 03:18.659
but I'm not gonna leave
Pike River without you!

03:18.693 --> 03:22.762
I'd say we got ourselves a problem, Joanna.

03:22.796 --> 03:26.399
'Cause the only way I'm
leaving my farm is in a box.

03:26.433 --> 03:29.269
In a box!

03:29.303 --> 03:30.971
Dad.

03:31.005 --> 03:34.941
I got nothing more to say.

03:34.976 --> 03:37.877
(Door bangs shut, engine starts)

03:37.911 --> 03:40.312
(Rooster crows, birds chirp)

03:40.347 --> 03:44.016
- Lou: Why don't you just call him, Amy?
- Jack: Lou, let it go.

03:44.050 --> 03:47.687
Amy: No! Why should I call him?
Ty hasn't even thanked me

03:47.721 --> 03:49.856
for picking him up from jail when he
was thrown in. He should be calling me.

03:49.890 --> 03:51.758
Relationships take work,

03:51.792 --> 03:53.792
and nothing happens
unless you make it happen.

03:53.826 --> 03:55.827
Amy: Well,
I'm not gonna force it to happen, Lou.

03:55.862 --> 03:58.463
You know,
maybe I should just let go and move on.

03:58.498 --> 03:59.865
Tim: Sometimes you have to
give it a second chance.

03:59.900 --> 04:02.201
(Screen door bangs shut) Amy: No. I don't.

04:02.235 --> 04:04.970
- Georgie: Has Peter called yet?
- Lou: Uh, he texted.

04:05.005 --> 04:08.073
His flight last night was apparently...
canceled,

04:08.108 --> 04:11.142
but, um, he's flying in this morning...
I think.

04:11.176 --> 04:14.145
So are we still going to the dude ranch
for our family "staycation."

04:14.179 --> 04:16.581
Lou: Yes, we are.
We planned it and we're doing it.

04:16.616 --> 04:19.221
Georgie: But what if he doesn't get here?

04:21.220 --> 04:22.854
Amy: Maybe you should give him a call, Lou.

04:22.889 --> 04:24.423
"Nothing happens unless
you make it happen."

04:24.457 --> 04:27.425
(Phone rings) Lou: Very funny.

04:27.459 --> 04:29.127
(Phone beeps) Jack: Hello.

04:29.161 --> 04:31.695
Yeah, speaking.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.532
Well, Joanna Hawke? It's been a while.

04:34.566 --> 04:37.635
How're you doing?

04:37.669 --> 04:39.170
Oh? What seems to be the problem?

04:39.204 --> 04:41.439
Is Will okay?

04:42.970 --> 04:46.429

Georgie: What's a cull?

05:24.305 --> 05:28.007
Lou: The um... a government committee
decides there are too many wild horses,

05:28.027 --> 05:30.267
so they give out permits to capture them.

05:30.287 --> 05:33.222
- But then they re-home them, right?
- Amy: That's the intention.

05:33.256 --> 05:34.590
Tim:
They usually end up in the slaughterhouse.

05:34.624 --> 05:36.058
- Amy: Dad!
- Georgie: What?!

05:36.092 --> 05:37.693
How could they? They're so beautiful!

05:37.727 --> 05:39.662
Lou: But why you, grandpa?

05:39.696 --> 05:42.364
I mean, what does Joanna
realistically think you can do?

05:42.399 --> 05:44.400
Jack: Well,
she figures he might listen to me.

05:44.434 --> 05:47.169
I'm probably his last friend standing.

05:47.204 --> 05:48.770
Amy: Okay, but wait, wait, wait.
Grandpa, if Joanna called,

05:48.805 --> 05:50.338
she's obviously seriously worried,

05:50.372 --> 05:52.407
so we better go out there, and...

05:52.441 --> 05:54.009
Besides,
maybe I can help gentle some of the horses

05:54.043 --> 05:55.744
and re-home them?

05:55.778 --> 05:56.878
- Georgie: I'm going too.
- Lou: No, no, no.

05:56.913 --> 05:58.646
Georgie, this weekend is planned.

05:58.681 --> 06:01.216
And besides, your arm.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.719
Georgie: My arm is fine,
and I can still help Amy with the horses.

06:03.753 --> 06:06.053
Georgie, Peter was really looking
forward to some family time.

06:06.088 --> 06:07.922
He's not even here.

06:07.956 --> 06:09.457
Well,
it's probably best if just Amy and I go.

06:09.491 --> 06:11.326
You've never met Will.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.794
He's not exactly the most
social guy in the world.

06:13.829 --> 06:16.231
The less people, the better. Believe me.

06:16.265 --> 06:19.667
Tim: I see an opportunity.

06:19.702 --> 06:22.737
Jack, you gotta make sure that
Ty goes to Pike River too.

06:22.771 --> 06:24.939
Jack: Why is that?

06:24.973 --> 06:27.742
Tim: It'd be a good chance to throw
him and Amy together - to talk.

06:27.776 --> 06:30.577
Since when did you become a
fan of getting them together?

06:30.612 --> 06:32.679
Since I got sick of watching Amy

06:32.714 --> 06:34.181
mooning around here all the time.

06:34.216 --> 06:36.250
I can't stand it. You heard her in there.

06:36.284 --> 06:38.585
Pike River holds good memories for them.

06:38.620 --> 06:40.621
Once they're together,
they're gonna be forced to deal.

06:40.655 --> 06:42.822
Jack: Yeah, or not.

06:42.857 --> 06:47.127
Don't be so negative.
This is a perfect plan.

06:47.161 --> 06:49.429
Ty and Amy need to work
their stuff out on their own.

06:49.464 --> 06:51.365
You leave it alone.

06:51.399 --> 06:53.600
(Loud clank)

06:53.635 --> 06:56.302
Ty: Okay, so...
Will's refusing to move out of his house?

06:56.336 --> 06:59.472
Tim: Yeah.
Jack wants to go help his old buddy -

06:59.506 --> 07:02.708
drive up there,
see if he can change his mind.

07:02.743 --> 07:05.879
Really. That's a long drive.

07:05.913 --> 07:09.082
Tim: Well, it seems Will's
health's not so good either.

07:09.116 --> 07:11.151
And there are some wild horses involved

07:11.185 --> 07:13.753
that he's been looking after -
they need medical attention,

07:13.787 --> 07:16.389
and there's talk of a... of a cull.

07:16.423 --> 07:20.304
Yeah, I've heard about that, but uh...

07:21.027 --> 07:22.627
I'm not so sure you
came all the way up here

07:22.647 --> 07:24.710
to talk to me about Will.

07:24.896 --> 07:26.732
It's about Jack.

07:26.767 --> 07:30.002
You haven't been around a lot lately,
but he is really going downhill.

07:30.036 --> 07:32.004
I don't think that he should go alone.

07:32.038 --> 07:33.638
So, what? You're saying that
I should go up there too?

07:33.673 --> 07:35.607
I hate to ask, you know?

07:35.641 --> 07:38.955
But I didn't come here for a visit.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.614
But I get it.

07:42.648 --> 07:45.049
I know, you're busy. Forget it.

07:45.083 --> 07:47.285
- Ty: No, no, no, no. I...
- Tim: No... no. Forget it.

07:47.320 --> 07:50.422
Tim, I wanna help Jack, okay? It's just...

07:50.456 --> 07:52.156
My truck's pretty unpredictable right now

07:52.191 --> 07:53.325
and I'm not even sure if
I can make it up there.

07:53.359 --> 07:56.093
- Tim: Well, mine's good.
- Ty: Uh...

07:56.128 --> 07:58.177
- Tim: We can go together.
- Ty: You and I?

07:58.197 --> 07:59.564
Tim: Yeah.

07:59.598 --> 08:03.667
- Ty: Uh... well, it's a long drive.
- It's for Jack. It's...

08:03.702 --> 08:06.637
It's not... It's for Jack.

08:06.671 --> 08:07.972
Yeah. (Trailer door opens)

08:08.006 --> 08:10.945
(SUV doors open and close, gravel clatters)

08:12.644 --> 08:15.980
Lou: Look, Georgie, honey,
I know you're disappointed,

08:16.014 --> 08:18.682
but it's gonna be a really great weekend,
okay?

08:18.717 --> 08:21.051
I promise. Let's unpack, come on.

08:21.085 --> 08:22.886
(Vehicle rumbles)

08:22.920 --> 08:24.956
Lou: Well, look who it is.

08:24.976 --> 08:26.915
(Taxi rumbles)

08:29.707 --> 08:31.398
(Door opens)

08:31.693 --> 08:34.717
- Katie: Daddy!
- Peter: Hey, you! Hi! Hey!

08:36.366 --> 08:38.634
Georgie: Hi!

08:38.669 --> 08:39.802
Peter: Let's get this party started!

08:39.837 --> 08:41.972
- Katie: Come on!
- Georgie: All right.

08:42.006 --> 08:43.806
It's nice of you to come.

08:43.841 --> 08:45.742
What's that supposed to mean?

08:45.776 --> 08:47.744
It means I know your flight
wasn't canceled last night.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.479
I checked online.

08:51.515 --> 08:53.315
(Truck rumbles)

08:53.350 --> 08:56.097
Jack: Boy, what a mess.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.354
Amy: Wow. Joanna's selling?

08:59.389 --> 09:01.423
Jack: Looks like it.

09:06.963 --> 09:08.597
(Engine shuts off, doors open)

09:11.334 --> 09:13.302
(Doors bang shut)

09:16.639 --> 09:19.341
Joanna: Hey! It's so good to see you!

09:19.375 --> 09:21.976
You too, Joanna! Hi.

09:22.011 --> 09:23.845
Amy: It's been so long!

09:23.879 --> 09:26.647
(Sharp exhale)

09:26.682 --> 09:28.149
Joanna: (Sighs) You think it looks bad now?

09:28.184 --> 09:32.287
Believe me, it's way better than it was
right after the flood.

09:32.321 --> 09:34.823
It's kinda quiet around here.

09:34.857 --> 09:37.025
Well, people left...
To live with relatives,

09:37.059 --> 09:39.627
temporary housing. You know.

09:39.661 --> 09:41.729
And even though it's
getting cleaned up now,

09:41.763 --> 09:44.684
a lot of people just haven't come back.

09:45.734 --> 09:47.735
Amy: So how's your son doing?

09:47.769 --> 09:50.571
Joanna: Sam? You wouldn't recognize him.
He's this tall.

09:50.605 --> 09:51.972
He's in first year university in Calgary.

09:52.006 --> 09:53.541
Amy: No way.
Joanna: (Laughs)

09:53.575 --> 09:56.109
Jack: All grown up.

09:56.144 --> 09:58.712
So when do you want me to go see Will?

09:58.746 --> 10:00.413
Joanna: (Sighs) We had a little
disagreement this morning.

10:00.448 --> 10:02.482
You might wanna wait till tomorrow.

10:02.516 --> 10:05.652
- Wait till he's cooled off, I guess.
- Jack: Oh. Hmm.

10:05.686 --> 10:07.387
Joanna: I figured you guys
might wanna stay here again.

10:07.421 --> 10:09.656
(Awkward silence)

10:09.690 --> 10:11.124
Is that okay?

10:11.159 --> 10:14.293
- Jack: Of course.
- Amy: Yeah.

10:14.328 --> 10:16.126
Joanna: Anyway, when you're ready,
come on down, I'll make some dinner.

10:16.146 --> 10:17.930
Terrific.

10:20.934 --> 10:24.136
(Amy sighs heavily, cabin door opens)

10:24.171 --> 10:26.439
Jack: (Laughs)

10:26.474 --> 10:28.742
Boy, this brings back some memories, huh?

10:28.776 --> 10:30.509
(Door creaks closed)

10:33.247 --> 10:34.713
- Ty: Oh, thank you.
- Amy: You're welcome.

10:34.748 --> 10:37.116
(Fire crackles) Ty: All right.

10:37.150 --> 10:39.150
- Ty: Comfy?
- Amy: Mm-hmm.

10:42.589 --> 10:43.990
Amy: (Laughing) Are you cold?

10:44.024 --> 10:45.624
Ty: (Laughs)

10:45.658 --> 10:47.393
Amy: I'll make you some tea.
It'll warm you up.

10:47.427 --> 10:48.761
Ty: All right. (Faucet squeaks)

10:48.795 --> 10:51.229
- Amy: Or... not.
- Ty: Oh, forget it.

10:51.264 --> 10:53.699
(Water spurts violently) Ty: Oh!

10:53.733 --> 10:56.301
Ty: Agh!
Amy: (Laughing)

10:56.335 --> 10:59.337
Jack: Amy, remember that one night,
it was so cold

10:59.372 --> 11:03.212
we all had to bunk in
front of this fireplace.

11:10.224 --> 11:12.284
(Sighs) I'm here to work, grandpa.

11:12.318 --> 11:14.352
No place for a diamond ring.

11:14.387 --> 11:17.789
How're you doing?

11:17.823 --> 11:20.994
I didn't think it would be this hard.

11:22.499 --> 11:25.797
(Flap rustles)

11:25.831 --> 11:27.832
Peter: (Chuckles and groans) Whoa.

11:32.170 --> 11:34.825
Georgie: Wow!
Peter: You sure you wanna sleep in here?

11:34.845 --> 11:36.673
Yeah! Absolutely!

11:36.707 --> 11:39.244
Okay.
Well, we'll clean it out then, I guess.

11:39.264 --> 11:41.678
Great.

11:41.712 --> 11:43.780
I can stay in here with you if you want,
you know?

11:43.815 --> 11:46.183
Oh, no, it's all right.
A few cobwebs don't scare me.

11:46.217 --> 11:49.053
(Chuckles) Okay. If you say so.

11:49.087 --> 11:50.654
Hey, you know what? Uh...

11:50.688 --> 11:52.323
Mom said that you were kind of bummed

11:52.357 --> 11:54.424
that you didn't get to go to Pike River.

11:54.459 --> 11:56.359
But selfishly, I'm really glad you didn't

11:56.393 --> 11:58.361
because I've been travelling so much,

11:58.395 --> 12:00.897
I never get to see you guys and I miss you.

12:00.932 --> 12:03.800
Georgie: I miss you too. So does Lou.

12:03.835 --> 12:06.503
A lot, actually.

12:06.537 --> 12:08.505
She really wants you to
spend more time with us.

12:08.539 --> 12:10.273
You know, she gets really angry

12:10.307 --> 12:11.807
when you don't come home
when you say you Will.

12:11.842 --> 12:14.810
She goes on and on and on.

12:14.845 --> 12:18.066
Hmm. Good to know.

12:21.018 --> 12:23.127
(Door opens and closes)

12:24.754 --> 12:27.356
Chad: Well, look who it is.

12:27.390 --> 12:30.125
Amy Fleming and Jack Bartlett!
The horse rescuers!

12:30.159 --> 12:31.426
Jack: Chad! Good to see you, man.

12:31.461 --> 12:34.262
- So what brings you here?
- Amy: Oh, we're visiting Joanna.

12:34.297 --> 12:38.166
- Yeah, and Will.
- Chad: Oh, is that all?

12:38.201 --> 12:40.068
It wouldn't have anything to do with,
you know, the cull now, would it?

12:40.103 --> 12:42.804
Amy: Uh... maybe.

12:42.838 --> 12:45.307
(Sighs) Well, here we go again.

12:45.341 --> 12:47.775
No matter. Welcome back!

12:47.810 --> 12:50.412
Amy: (Laughs)
Jack: (Chuckling) Thanks.

12:50.446 --> 12:53.515
(Low hum of chatter)

12:53.549 --> 12:58.520
(Old country music) ♪...Won't make me
happy, but it surely pays the bills ♪

12:58.554 --> 13:03.939
♪ I keep going down town,
spending it, honey- ♪

13:03.959 --> 13:06.561
(Engine cuts out) Tim: Wow!

13:06.595 --> 13:10.364
That went by pretty fast.

13:10.399 --> 13:14.602
Nothing like a good cd to help time fly by,
huh?

13:14.637 --> 13:16.837
Ty: Yeah, especially when
it's on a loop for five hours.

13:16.871 --> 13:18.717
- Tim: Yeah.
- Ty: Yeah.

13:18.737 --> 13:21.126
(Door opens and closes)

13:22.777 --> 13:24.211
What the...?

13:24.246 --> 13:26.313
Hey, Jack.

13:26.348 --> 13:28.715
You're looking good. Really good.

13:28.750 --> 13:29.917
How're you feeling?

13:29.951 --> 13:32.085
I'm feeling just fine. Why?

13:32.119 --> 13:34.487
What are you doing here, Tim?

13:34.522 --> 13:36.690
Chad: Ty Borden!

13:36.724 --> 13:38.425
Ty: Hey, Chad! Good to see you!

13:38.459 --> 13:40.027
- Chad: Good to see you. Tim.
- Tim: Chad.

13:40.061 --> 13:43.196
(Amy and Joanna chatter)

13:44.021 --> 13:46.066
Ty: Amy.

13:46.984 --> 13:48.834
Hi, Joanna.

13:48.869 --> 13:52.238
Joanna: This is a surprise.
Ty, it's good to see you.

13:52.273 --> 13:54.671
What're you doing here? Grandpa?

13:54.691 --> 13:56.276
Don't look at me.

13:56.310 --> 13:57.710
Ty: I came to help with Will's horses.

13:57.744 --> 13:59.546
Tim said they need medical attention.

13:59.580 --> 14:01.381
Matt: Will's horses?

14:01.415 --> 14:03.316
You talking about his wild horses?

14:03.350 --> 14:05.417
'Cause there's no helping them, buddy.

14:05.452 --> 14:07.081
And if that's what you're here for,

14:07.101 --> 14:08.745
I'd go right back where you came from

14:08.765 --> 14:13.492
'cause, those horses, their time is up.

14:21.677 --> 14:23.461
Dad you can't be serious.

14:23.462 --> 14:26.125
Chad: Look, uh...
I don't like Matt t Pincher

14:26.159 --> 14:28.894
or the way he goes about things,

14:28.929 --> 14:30.629
but those horses have got to go.

14:30.663 --> 14:32.698
I... I... I agree with him.

14:32.733 --> 14:34.166
Amy: How can you agree with him?

14:34.201 --> 14:36.035
Those horses have every right to be there.

14:36.069 --> 14:38.437
I mean, you can't cull them. That's wrong.

14:38.471 --> 14:40.372
Chad: No offence,
but you can't possibly know

14:40.406 --> 14:42.674
how much of a problem it is
unless you've lived here.

14:42.709 --> 14:44.443
I can't count the number of times

14:44.477 --> 14:47.045
they've taken out my fences.
But... but never mind that.

14:47.079 --> 14:49.481
It's a, it's a total environmental concern.

14:49.515 --> 14:51.916
- Amy: How?
- Chad: Because they eat the grass,

14:51.951 --> 14:53.719
and so do the deer, and the elk,

14:53.753 --> 14:56.288
so it's a case of overgrazing.

14:56.322 --> 14:59.958
Jack: (Frustrated sigh) We're talking
tens of thousands of acres here, Chad.

14:59.992 --> 15:02.628
They're not exactly
overrunning the countryside!

15:02.662 --> 15:05.463
Fact is, the population's way up

15:05.497 --> 15:08.099
and there isn't enough predators
to naturally cull them out.

15:08.134 --> 15:10.168
Not enough predators?! Are you kidding me?

15:10.202 --> 15:12.170
There's wolves, cougars, coyotes,

15:12.204 --> 15:14.239
there was the flood and the bad winter...

15:14.273 --> 15:16.941
Chad: Look, guys, you've got
this fairy tale idea in your head

15:16.976 --> 15:20.110
of the noble wild horses running free.

15:20.145 --> 15:22.380
There is way more to it than that.

15:22.414 --> 15:25.683
Chad: Yeah? Would it be different
if they were ugly feral boars

15:25.717 --> 15:26.717
running out there wrecking everything?

15:26.752 --> 15:28.352
You'd shoot 'em on sight.

15:28.387 --> 15:30.954
Amy: No, I wouldn't,
but you can't compare the two.

15:30.989 --> 15:33.857
Chad: Yes, you can.
It's called a double standard...

15:37.361 --> 15:39.997
I'm sorry, Joanna,
but that's the way it is,

15:40.031 --> 15:41.799
and the sooner your dad realizes that,
the better.

15:41.833 --> 15:44.868
I mean, y-you heard him.
Matt's on the warpath,

15:44.903 --> 15:46.603
especially when it comes to Will's horses.

15:46.637 --> 15:47.604
Joanna: That's enough,
Chad, they just got here.

15:47.638 --> 15:49.739
Let 'em eat.

15:52.643 --> 15:54.944
Chad: Yeah.

15:54.978 --> 15:57.246
(Door opens, crow caws in the distance)

16:00.083 --> 16:03.052
Jack: So Amy and me,
we're in Joanna's cabin.

16:03.086 --> 16:04.621
Tim: Okay, well,
Ty and I'll be at the hotel.

16:04.655 --> 16:06.623
Amy: 'Kay. Good night.

16:06.657 --> 16:09.391
(Low hum of chatter)

16:09.426 --> 16:11.227
(Quietly) Thanks, Tim.

16:11.261 --> 16:13.162
Why didn't you tell me
that Amy was gonna be here?

16:13.197 --> 16:14.997
You didn't ask.

16:15.032 --> 16:19.001
(Crow caws, low hum of chatter)

16:19.036 --> 16:20.970
Amy: Why is Ty here?

16:21.004 --> 16:23.439
Jack: Look,
I don't know what your dad told him.

16:23.473 --> 16:25.541
He thought it was a good
idea for you guys to talk.

16:25.575 --> 16:28.143
I didn't agree.

16:28.177 --> 16:30.579
But now that we're all here, Amy,

16:30.613 --> 16:32.981
we gotta get on with what needs doing.

16:33.015 --> 16:35.651
But doesn't dad realize
how awkward this is for us?

16:35.685 --> 16:37.953
Especially here of all places.

16:37.987 --> 16:40.589
It's just... It's too painful.

16:40.623 --> 16:42.423
Help me keep a safe distance, okay?

16:42.458 --> 16:46.261
(Door bursts open)

16:46.295 --> 16:48.429
Tim: Joanna failed to mention
that there is no water

16:48.464 --> 16:49.965
or electricity at the
hotel since the flood,

16:49.999 --> 16:51.366
so I'm here with you.

16:51.400 --> 16:53.468
Uh, so where's Ty?

16:53.502 --> 16:56.570
He chose to stay in the truck.

16:59.241 --> 17:01.609
(Crickets chirp, coyotes and wolves howl)

17:04.680 --> 17:06.347
(Georgie sighs, rustling sounds)

17:06.382 --> 17:07.915
(Squeaking)

17:14.256 --> 17:16.190
(Frightened, but determined sigh)

17:16.223 --> 17:19.260
(Door closes, slow, even footsteps)

17:28.336 --> 17:30.137
(Cupboard opens)

17:35.777 --> 17:38.578
(Padding footsteps, loud gasp)

17:38.613 --> 17:43.116
Amy: Oh... (Sighs) Ty.
I didn't- I didn't know you were here.

17:43.150 --> 17:44.885
- Ty: Sorry.
- Amy: I'm just getting some orange juice.

17:44.919 --> 17:46.152
Ty: Getting some water.

17:48.722 --> 17:51.090
(Tap runs, fridge closes)

17:51.125 --> 17:53.159
Do you remember the last time we were here,

17:53.193 --> 17:55.347
that water was so... (Laughing)

17:55.367 --> 17:56.963
Gross.

17:56.997 --> 18:01.614
Yeah. And the blocked
chimney and all the smoke...

18:03.971 --> 18:08.073
Hey, Ty,
thank you for standing up for me tonight.

18:08.107 --> 18:11.276
I like Chad, I do, but really,

18:11.311 --> 18:13.312
all that stuff about those horses
not having any predators...?

18:13.346 --> 18:15.781
- It was a bunch of crap.
- Yeah.

18:18.151 --> 18:21.453
Hey, Amy... (Whispering) Is Jack okay?

18:21.487 --> 18:24.156
Yeah. Of course. Why?

18:24.190 --> 18:27.826
Ty: Well, your dad said that he...

18:27.860 --> 18:31.263
Never mind, it... it's your dad.
I should've known.

18:31.985 --> 18:33.792
Yeah.

18:37.259 --> 18:39.604
Good night.

18:39.638 --> 18:41.205
Good night. (Receding footsteps)

18:49.414 --> 18:51.360
- Amy: What was that?
- Ty: It's the damper! Ugh!

18:51.380 --> 18:52.315
(Fire crackles)

18:52.335 --> 18:54.452
- Amy: Oh... (Laughs)
- Ty: Oh, man.

18:54.486 --> 18:56.020
Ty: (Coughing)

18:58.823 --> 19:01.592
Whoa! It's like your dad rigged the place.

19:01.626 --> 19:03.227
Oh!

19:07.232 --> 19:09.100
(Door creaks closed)

19:09.134 --> 19:13.523
Katie is fast asleep, finally.

19:15.099 --> 19:16.917
(Wolves howl in the distance)

19:19.957 --> 19:22.212
(Blows out breath) So,
I need to know, Peter.

19:22.246 --> 19:26.182
Why...
why didn't you take that flight last night?

19:26.217 --> 19:29.831
Why did you tell me it was
canceled when it wasn't?

19:31.088 --> 19:32.489
How do you think I felt?
I go online, and there it is.

19:32.523 --> 19:34.524
Flight status: On time.

19:34.558 --> 19:37.427
What am I supposed to think?

19:37.461 --> 19:40.440
Why didn't you just tell me?

19:41.265 --> 19:44.867
Peter: Because Lou, um, if I told you,

19:44.902 --> 19:48.004
I was afraid that you would just...

19:48.038 --> 19:51.641
You're head would just explode
like it usually does, okay?

19:51.675 --> 19:53.743
I would rather you just told me the truth.

19:53.777 --> 19:55.945
Okay, well, I'd had two weeks

19:55.979 --> 19:58.313
of incredibly intense and
stressful negotiations,

19:58.348 --> 20:00.715
I was at meeting,
after meeting, after meeting,

20:00.750 --> 20:03.052
and I just needed one night...

20:03.086 --> 20:04.819
One night to just decompress
before I came home.

20:04.854 --> 20:07.189
What about my night to...?

20:07.223 --> 20:10.592
I never get a chance to decompress, honey.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.429
Okay... point taken.

20:13.463 --> 20:16.365
(Sighs heavily)

20:16.399 --> 20:18.867
You know what?
Georgie's been telling me how angry you get

20:18.901 --> 20:20.802
when I don't come home as
often as you think I should.

20:20.836 --> 20:22.370
So, apparently, now you're sharing

20:22.404 --> 20:24.372
all these negative feelings with our...
with our kids?

20:24.406 --> 20:27.008
- Lou: No, I don't.
- Peter: So I'm always the bad guy?

20:27.043 --> 20:28.610
You can't involve them in our
personal issues like that, Lou.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.979
It-it's not fair.

20:31.013 --> 20:32.246
They shouldn't have to
shoulder that burden.

20:32.281 --> 20:35.083
If anything, I am covering for you.

20:35.117 --> 20:37.785
(Door opens) Georgie:
Can I sleep with you guys?

20:37.819 --> 20:40.020
I mean, it is way too scary out
there for me to sleep by myself!

20:40.055 --> 20:42.890
Lou: Shh... Katie is sleeping, okay?

20:42.924 --> 20:45.426
Peter: Hey, I'll tell you what.

20:45.461 --> 20:48.496
Why don't you and I bunk
together in the teepee?

20:48.530 --> 20:50.430
- Georgie: Oh, okay.
- Peter: Huh?

20:50.465 --> 20:51.865
It's been a while since I've
slept under the stars myself.

20:51.900 --> 20:54.568
Georgie: (Giggles)
Lou: Peter...

20:54.603 --> 20:57.437
Georgie: You got bug spray?
Bear spray? Good night, Lou!

20:57.472 --> 20:59.372
(Door shuts, fire crackles)

21:01.843 --> 21:03.343
(Birds chirp)

21:03.377 --> 21:05.946
(Truck rumbles)

21:13.982 --> 21:17.163
Will: Well, would you look what
an ill wind blew up right here.

21:17.183 --> 21:18.191
Jack Bartlett!

21:18.226 --> 21:20.360
Jack: How are you doing,
you miserable old dog?

21:20.394 --> 21:21.928
Will: You watch who you're calling a dog.

21:21.962 --> 21:25.031
Jack: (Laughing)
Will: Good to see you!

21:25.065 --> 21:29.135
Oh, Amy! This is a nice surprise.

21:29.169 --> 21:30.536
- It's good to see ya.
- Amy: You too.

21:30.570 --> 21:32.138
- Ty: Hey, Will.
- Will: And Ty!

21:32.172 --> 21:35.274
- Ty: Good to see you.
- Will: Yeah. Looking good.

21:35.308 --> 21:37.710
I don't suppose you guys remember

21:37.745 --> 21:40.712
that pregnant mare you rescued?

21:40.747 --> 21:45.451
Look over there. That's her foal, Lucky,
and that's his younger brother Sky,

21:45.485 --> 21:46.685
who's a bit of a character.

21:46.719 --> 21:49.188
Jack and Amy: (Laughing)

21:49.222 --> 21:51.190
Tim: It must have been pretty
rough here after the flood.

21:51.224 --> 21:55.004
It was. I think it changed people.

21:55.662 --> 21:56.795
Well, you haven't changed.

21:56.829 --> 21:58.897
Ah... (Laughs)

21:59.534 --> 22:03.234
You know, actually I have.

22:03.269 --> 22:06.535
I'm uh... I'm sorry I didn't call you.

22:06.555 --> 22:07.539
(Laughs)

22:08.280 --> 22:10.742
Life gets in the way.

22:11.283 --> 22:14.038
I didn't call you either.

22:14.913 --> 22:17.715
So with this place for sale,
what're your plans?

22:17.749 --> 22:20.418
Joanna: Well, there's a nice
area near Okotoks I'm looking at.

22:20.452 --> 22:22.420
It's close to Calgary,
so I'd get to see Sam a lot more.

22:22.454 --> 22:24.189
What about your dad?

22:24.223 --> 22:26.624
He's digging in his heels as usual.

22:26.659 --> 22:28.826
I'm hoping Jack might change his mind.

22:28.860 --> 22:30.661
I'm afraid I used the wild horses

22:30.696 --> 22:32.462
as an excuse to get Jack and Amy up here.

22:32.497 --> 22:35.566
Guilty of the same offence.

22:35.600 --> 22:38.002
Ty's studying to be a vet...

22:38.036 --> 22:41.172
Joanna: And you lured him up here too?
Because of Amy?

22:41.206 --> 22:44.775
Well... they're engaged. They were engaged.

22:44.810 --> 22:47.844
They-they... They should be engaged.

22:47.878 --> 22:50.733
And I just thought if I
could throw them together...

22:50.753 --> 22:53.384
You could trap them up here.

22:53.769 --> 22:55.051
We're bad.

22:55.086 --> 22:59.489
(Laughs) Yeah, we are...
Well, in a good way.

23:00.027 --> 23:01.745
It's really good to see you.

23:01.765 --> 23:04.027
You, too. (Mugs clink)

23:04.061 --> 23:05.628
Amy: I remember the night Lucky was born.

23:05.662 --> 23:08.464
It feels like so long ago.

23:08.498 --> 23:10.767
He seems pretty interested
in the wild horses.

23:10.801 --> 23:12.435
Will: Oh, he is that.

23:12.469 --> 23:15.605
Sometimes I worry that he's
gonna take off with them.

23:15.639 --> 23:18.674
Amy: Would you mind if I got
a closer look at the herd?

23:18.709 --> 23:22.535
Will: Well, sure, if you want to.
I mean, they're pretty wary though.

23:26.208 --> 23:28.283
- Jack: Hey, Will.
- Will: Yeah?

23:28.318 --> 23:30.785
- Jack: You got time for a chat?
- Will: Well, sure. You want some tea?

23:30.820 --> 23:33.526
- Jack: Well, I'd love some tea.
- Will: Well, let's go.

23:38.546 --> 23:40.528
Will: What's going on with you?

23:40.563 --> 23:43.237
Jack: Well... I had a heart attack.

23:44.800 --> 23:46.434
I had three.

23:46.469 --> 23:48.970
- Jack: No kidding.
- Will: Yeah.

23:49.004 --> 23:50.572
Well, okay, I guess you got me beat.

23:50.606 --> 23:52.606
Will: Again.
Jack and Will: (Laugh)

23:52.640 --> 23:55.542
I'm the big winner.

23:55.577 --> 23:58.712
Since I last saw you, I got married.

23:58.746 --> 24:00.414
- Will: No you didn't!
- Jack: Yes, I did.

24:00.449 --> 24:01.949
Who the hell'd marry you?

24:01.984 --> 24:05.686
Only the most beautiful
woman you've ever seen.

24:05.720 --> 24:08.344
- Will: Really?
- Jack: Yup.

24:08.364 --> 24:10.557
Yeah,
my heart attack almost put an end to us.

24:10.592 --> 24:12.125
She couldn't cope?

24:12.159 --> 24:15.729
No. No, she was great.

24:15.763 --> 24:18.079
It was me that couldn't cope.

24:18.099 --> 24:19.766
It makes you look in the mirror, you know?

24:19.801 --> 24:21.568
Yes it does.

24:21.603 --> 24:25.138
Anyway, we're married. Independent.

24:25.172 --> 24:28.112
She travels. I don't.

24:28.132 --> 24:29.675
Will: Isn't life weird? Jack: (Chuckles)

24:29.710 --> 24:31.844
Will: It is, you know?

24:31.879 --> 24:33.646
You know,
here it is we kinda come up together,

24:33.680 --> 24:35.648
started out the same time,
and we rodeoed...

24:35.682 --> 24:37.527
- Jack: (Chuckles) Yeah.
- Will: Played music.

24:37.549 --> 24:40.687
And then we met these wonderful women,
we had kids.

24:40.722 --> 24:43.590
But you...
you're still right there, aren't you?

24:43.624 --> 24:46.092
Well, I think you need to get
back in the centre of things.

24:46.127 --> 24:49.307
See Sam, move with Joanna.

24:50.275 --> 24:55.168
Will: Okay. Now I get it.
'Cause it's not like you

24:55.202 --> 24:58.678
to show up outta the blue anywhere, is it?

25:03.644 --> 25:06.311
What the hell business has she going and
involving you in our private affairs?!

25:06.346 --> 25:08.413
She's worried about you, Will.

25:08.448 --> 25:10.916
She wants to move, be closer to Sam,

25:10.951 --> 25:12.685
she wants you to go with her.

25:12.719 --> 25:15.754
Will: Well, I'm staying here!
(Slaps table) Right here!

25:15.788 --> 25:18.589
I really don't need anyone coming
here handing out stupid advice.

25:18.624 --> 25:20.558
You're just wasting your own good time,

25:20.592 --> 25:22.560
and you're wasting mine.

25:27.432 --> 25:28.933
Now what the...?

25:28.968 --> 25:30.902
(Horse whinnies)

25:39.044 --> 25:42.180
(Wild horse snorts threateningly)

25:47.553 --> 25:49.320
(Snorting and stamping
ground threateningly)

25:57.028 --> 25:58.195
(Horses whinny)

26:01.966 --> 26:03.901
I've been feeding these horses for years

26:03.935 --> 26:06.369
and never got that close to 'em.

26:06.404 --> 26:08.938
That's Amy for you. She's got a way.

26:08.972 --> 26:10.207
Will: Wow.

26:14.912 --> 26:17.247
I know you think I'm just being
kinda stubborn about all this,

26:17.281 --> 26:19.916
but I just really can't leave them.

26:19.950 --> 26:21.951
I can't leave them, Jack. Not now.

26:21.985 --> 26:25.387
I get why you wanna protect 'em.

26:25.422 --> 26:27.656
Will: You know it's my neighbour,
my good friend there.

26:27.691 --> 26:30.026
We looked after these horses,

26:30.060 --> 26:31.460
and there were some serious cold days.

26:31.494 --> 26:33.963
Without us, they definitely would've died.

26:33.997 --> 26:36.265
Malcolm Pincher, what a guy.

26:36.299 --> 26:38.601
Painted 'em! Really good painter.

26:38.635 --> 26:41.169
You should see some of his paintings.
Beautiful.

26:41.204 --> 26:44.973
Malcolm Pincher?
It's uh... related to Matt Pincher?

26:45.007 --> 26:47.042
Yeah. Father and son. That's his father.

26:47.076 --> 26:49.211
- Jack: No kidding.
- Will: For God sakes.

26:49.246 --> 26:52.981
So look, Jack,
it's always great to see you.

26:53.015 --> 26:55.384
- Jack: Yeah.
- Don't ever get me wrong on that point.

26:55.418 --> 26:57.252
But, you know,
Joanna should never have called you.

26:57.286 --> 26:58.286
She should never have brought
you all the way up here.

26:58.320 --> 26:59.988
- Stupid.
- Jack: Well, listen.

27:00.022 --> 27:02.023
Before I go, can we just...

27:02.058 --> 27:04.159
see if Amy can help those horses?

27:04.193 --> 27:05.393
And what is it do you think she can do?

27:05.427 --> 27:06.828
Well, she can gentle some of 'em.

27:06.863 --> 27:09.264
And find homes for 'em.

27:09.298 --> 27:12.667
I don't know. It feels wrong to me somehow.

27:12.701 --> 27:14.469
Well, if there's a cull,

27:14.503 --> 27:17.938
it's a better alternative wouldn't you say?

27:17.973 --> 27:20.174
Will: Oh... (Groans) Oh, God...

27:20.208 --> 27:21.242
Hey, are you okay? Hey, hey, hey...

27:21.277 --> 27:26.414
Yeah... yeah, I'm good.

27:26.448 --> 27:28.616
(Sighs)

27:32.982 --> 27:34.885
Just gotta sit down.

28:02.492 --> 28:05.615
Amy: It's okay.
You don't need to be afraid.

28:05.635 --> 28:07.322
(Horse sniffs and snorts)

28:07.342 --> 28:09.712
Hi... hey...

28:11.100 --> 28:12.997
That's it.

28:13.769 --> 28:15.704
Come on! Here!

28:15.738 --> 28:17.592
(Spartan grunts)

28:22.411 --> 28:24.045
(Spartan grunts)

28:24.079 --> 28:25.680
(Laughs)

28:30.418 --> 28:32.253
Aren't they incredible?

28:39.245 --> 28:40.959
Hello.

28:41.496 --> 28:43.970
Casey. You're breaking up.

28:44.900 --> 28:47.557
Case? Hey! There you are.

28:47.577 --> 28:49.436
No, no, no. The phone was breaking up,

28:49.470 --> 28:51.903
(laughing) Not-not us.

28:52.846 --> 28:55.442
Yeah, okay, I miss you too. I'll see you.

28:55.476 --> 28:57.644
Okay. Couple days. Bye.

28:57.679 --> 28:59.446
(Phone beeps off) Oh...

28:59.480 --> 29:02.148
I always forget you get
lousy reception up here.

29:02.183 --> 29:03.850
Thank you.

29:07.822 --> 29:10.457
Joanna: So? It's your turn.

29:10.491 --> 29:12.192
What's been going on in your
life since I saw you last?

29:12.226 --> 29:15.291
Tim: Oh, wow. Where do I begin?

29:16.234 --> 29:19.546
Well, I found out that I have
a son I didn't know about.

29:19.567 --> 29:22.769
Yeah, that was a big surprise.
His name is Shane.

29:22.804 --> 29:25.238
He's a good kid.
We spend a lot of time together.

29:25.272 --> 29:27.240
Joanna: And his mother?

29:27.274 --> 29:32.312
Ty: Uh... girlfriend from my
misspent post-divorce days.

29:32.346 --> 29:34.613
So we tried to spend some time together,

29:34.648 --> 29:37.383
make it work for Shane, but... it didn't,

29:37.418 --> 29:40.386
and now she's seeing a lawyer.
A young lawyer.

29:40.421 --> 29:42.088
Young, good-looking lawyer.

29:42.122 --> 29:45.090
That must just about kill you.

29:45.124 --> 29:48.461
I've come to terms with it.
(Laughing)

29:48.495 --> 29:50.362
What's new with you?

29:50.396 --> 29:51.931
I thought you might be heartbroken

29:51.965 --> 29:55.307
when I didn't call you,
but you seem to be fine.

29:55.327 --> 29:59.941
Joanna: I am. I put the past behind
me like you told me to, remember?

29:59.961 --> 30:01.239
Tim: Yeah.

30:01.274 --> 30:04.542
Joanna: Took me awhile,
but I've met someone that...

30:04.577 --> 30:06.647
I don't know,
I think I could be serious about.

30:06.667 --> 30:08.546
Tim: Good!

30:09.174 --> 30:11.544
Well, I met someone too.

30:12.218 --> 30:14.477
Yeah, her name's Casey McMurtry.

30:14.497 --> 30:16.188
She runs rodeos.

30:16.222 --> 30:18.723
- Joanna: You should go for it.
- Tim: Yeah, I don't know.

30:18.757 --> 30:20.859
I don't wanna get too serious, too fast.

30:20.893 --> 30:23.595
I don't have the best track record.

30:23.629 --> 30:25.497
(Joanna chuckles, birds chirp)

30:25.531 --> 30:27.765
(Canoe Bobs in the water)

30:27.800 --> 30:30.368
Georgie, grab a life jacket! Let's go.

30:30.402 --> 30:32.336
(Twigs clatter) Lou: What're you doing?

30:32.371 --> 30:34.338
We're gonna take the canoe out.

30:34.373 --> 30:35.772
I can't wait to teach you how to paddle.

30:35.807 --> 30:37.774
I was really good at
it when I was your age.

30:37.809 --> 30:40.344
- Georgie: Okay!
- Lou: Um, Peter,

30:40.379 --> 30:42.779
your daughter has a broken arm.

30:42.814 --> 30:43.981
I don't know how she's
gonna get in the canoe,

30:44.016 --> 30:46.217
much less... paddle.

30:46.251 --> 30:47.751
(Laughs) Oh, yeah, right.

30:47.785 --> 30:50.154
- Georgie: Great.
- Peter: Ah... okay!

30:50.188 --> 30:52.355
Well,
let's go fish off the end of the dock then?

30:52.390 --> 30:54.445
Georgie: Same thing!
How am I supposed to reel anything in?

30:54.465 --> 30:56.994
Peter... she can't.

30:57.028 --> 30:59.029
Peter: Sure you can. We can be a team.

30:59.063 --> 31:00.831
You work the rod, I'll do the reel,

31:00.865 --> 31:03.099
if we're lucky enough to get something.

31:03.134 --> 31:05.794
- Go get the rods, come on!
- Georgie: Okay, fine!

31:05.937 --> 31:07.504
(Laughing)

31:12.410 --> 31:14.234
Come on.

31:16.306 --> 31:19.297
(Running hooves, high-pitched whinny)

31:27.790 --> 31:29.658
Amy: Hey, Ty,
this one's got a bad cut on him.

31:29.692 --> 31:31.960
Do you have anything that'll help?

31:31.994 --> 31:34.596
Ty: Well,
I have my kit in your dad's truck.

31:34.630 --> 31:37.498
He'll probably need to be dewormed too.

31:37.533 --> 31:39.734
(Horse whinnies sharply)

31:39.769 --> 31:43.071
(Wild horses thunder away)

31:47.976 --> 31:51.112
Sorry about that.

31:51.146 --> 31:53.981
(Birds chirp)

31:54.846 --> 31:56.893
Hey, uh...

31:57.586 --> 32:00.352
What do you think about
taking Sky and Lucky out

32:00.372 --> 32:01.755
for a little ride?

32:01.775 --> 32:05.763
Amy: Um... yeah, sure.

32:05.783 --> 32:07.527
All right.

32:07.562 --> 32:10.497
(Hooves plod lightly, tack jingles)

32:15.003 --> 32:16.570
(Birds chirp)

32:21.976 --> 32:25.845
Ty: What's this?

32:25.879 --> 32:27.947
Amy: It's a horse trap.

32:27.982 --> 32:30.217
(Whispers) Ty...

32:30.251 --> 32:32.819
(ATV rumbles nearby)

32:37.290 --> 32:39.826
(ATV rumbles to a stop)

32:52.239 --> 32:53.805
(Saltlick thumps on ground)

32:53.840 --> 32:55.407
Amy: He's baiting the horses with salt.

32:55.442 --> 32:57.809
(Gate creaks open)

33:00.913 --> 33:03.081
(Horse snorts)

33:05.152 --> 33:07.653
(Birds chirp)

33:15.294 --> 33:18.730
(ATV rumbles away)

33:26.138 --> 33:29.073
(Birds chirp, fire crackles)

33:32.478 --> 33:35.046
(Reel winds)

33:35.080 --> 33:37.815
Georgie: Peter, I got something!
I got it, Peter!

33:37.849 --> 33:38.916
Peter: Oh, good, good, good!
You're doing good!

33:38.950 --> 33:41.352
Here. (Laughs) All right, hold it!

33:41.387 --> 33:42.687
Georgie: Okay, okay, okay.
I'll hold it, I'll hold it.

33:42.721 --> 33:44.021
- Peter: Okay, I'll reel it in.
- Georgie: Okay. Oh!

33:44.056 --> 33:47.257
- Peter: Woo! (Laughing)
- Georgie: Okay! (Laughing)

33:47.292 --> 33:48.159
- Georgie: Okay, okay.
- Peter: You got him, you got him.

33:48.193 --> 33:49.493
- Georgie: Okay, okay.
- Peter: Easy, easy.

33:49.527 --> 33:50.594
Georgie: I'll try to reel him in.

33:50.628 --> 33:53.798
(Water splashes) Okay, okay.

33:53.832 --> 33:55.806
- Georgie: (Squeals) Oh my God!
- Katie: Mama, they caught a fish!

33:55.826 --> 33:57.134
Lou: Yeah.

33:57.169 --> 33:59.670
- Georgie: (Laughing) Okay!
- Peter: Closer, closer.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.705
Georgie and Peter: (Laughing excitedly)

34:01.739 --> 34:04.575
- Georgie: We got one!
- Peter: Good job!

34:04.609 --> 34:06.710
Georgie: (Laughing) Woo-hoo!

34:08.513 --> 34:10.480
Joanna: Hey, Jack.

34:10.514 --> 34:12.639
So did you get a chance to
talk to dad about the move?

34:12.659 --> 34:14.117
Jack: Yeah, I did.

34:14.150 --> 34:17.453
It seems his herd of horses is
a bigger issue than you thought.

34:17.487 --> 34:19.734
There's no way he's gonna
even consider moving

34:19.754 --> 34:21.789
until that's put to rest.

34:21.987 --> 34:23.193
(Door closes)

34:23.226 --> 34:26.877
Matt: Listen up, everyone.
I just came from the meeting.

34:27.496 --> 34:31.101
Stamped, sealed and approved.
The cull is on.

34:31.375 --> 34:32.935
Here's my permit.

34:32.969 --> 34:35.638
Chad: So you ingratiated yourself
into that group, right, Matt?

34:35.672 --> 34:37.592
I got the permit totally without prejudice.

34:37.612 --> 34:40.456
(Laughing) There's no way that's true.

34:40.476 --> 34:43.911
You can't make friends with all those reps
and then give yourself the only permit

34:43.947 --> 34:47.116
before any of us even
know the cull's happening.

34:47.150 --> 34:49.900
I had no more knowledge of when or if
this cull was actually gonna happen

34:49.920 --> 34:51.620
than any of you guys did.

34:51.654 --> 34:53.355
Amy: Okay,
so if you didn't know it was happening,

34:53.389 --> 34:55.791
then why did you build a corral
in the middle of nowhere,

34:55.824 --> 34:57.993
just waiting and ready for
those horses to be penned up in?

34:58.027 --> 35:00.867
Chad: Is that... true?

35:01.996 --> 35:05.634
Oh...
so you did have an inside word before us.

35:05.668 --> 35:08.169
You all knew that this cull was coming.

35:08.647 --> 35:10.672
Anyone of you could've prepared,
but you didn't.

35:10.706 --> 35:12.507
Tim: Yeah, but like Amy said,

35:12.541 --> 35:15.323
sounds like you knew before anybody else.

35:15.343 --> 35:17.999
Excuse me, who are you?

35:20.245 --> 35:21.792
You tell your dad,

35:21.812 --> 35:24.249
he better not try to protect those horses.

35:24.269 --> 35:26.535
'Cause if he tries to fight me,
he's gonna lose.

35:26.555 --> 35:29.223
Amy: Okay. Okay.
So the cull has been ordered.

35:29.804 --> 35:31.925
It's Matt, right?

35:31.960 --> 35:34.361
Why don't we at least try to
gentle some of the horses.

35:34.396 --> 35:35.596
Ty:
We could get them a clean bill of health...

35:35.630 --> 35:37.231
Amy: And we could re-home them.

35:37.265 --> 35:39.600
Matt: Yeah, that all sounds wonderful,

35:39.634 --> 35:42.535
but you're not gonna have time to put
those splendid plans into practice.

35:42.570 --> 35:45.438
You're a bit late to the game.

35:45.473 --> 35:48.976
(Door opens and closes)

35:55.249 --> 35:56.962
Hey, Amy.

35:59.121 --> 36:03.925
I just wanted to say um...
how proud I am of you...

36:03.959 --> 36:06.276
For standing up to Matt
like you did in there.

36:06.296 --> 36:07.889
That was great.

36:07.909 --> 36:09.963
Thanks.

36:09.998 --> 36:12.166
(Chuckles)

36:12.200 --> 36:15.536
I guess that's one good
thing about being on tour.

36:15.570 --> 36:18.539
I learned to deal with a very opinionated

36:18.573 --> 36:20.107
and aggressive group of people.

36:20.142 --> 36:21.975
(Chuckles awkwardly, crow caws)

36:25.013 --> 36:26.913
I can't believe what this flood did.

36:26.948 --> 36:29.415
Look at this.

36:30.178 --> 36:33.120
(Sighs) Yeah.

36:33.154 --> 36:36.213
The whole course of the river's
changed since we were here.

36:42.616 --> 36:43.963
I'm gonna head in.

36:43.997 --> 36:46.799
(Receding footsteps)

36:53.507 --> 36:55.708
(Fire crackles, birds chirp)

37:02.015 --> 37:03.848
Lou: So cute.

37:03.883 --> 37:07.365
Georgie's reading Katie a bedtime story.

37:08.320 --> 37:11.646
- Yeah. She's amazing with her, eh?
- Yeah.

37:13.525 --> 37:17.611
So...
um, we haven't had much time alone to talk.

37:17.631 --> 37:19.604
I know... (Sigh)

37:20.063 --> 37:21.626
Um...

37:23.735 --> 37:25.570
You made it pretty clear
to me that you don't feel

37:25.604 --> 37:28.990
like I'm supporting you
in the way that I should.

37:30.275 --> 37:35.360
I feel like I'm...
outside this family looking in.

37:35.380 --> 37:37.181
You know, that's- that's just how I feel.

37:37.215 --> 37:39.883
That's not my fault, Peter.

37:39.918 --> 37:42.086
I'm not trying to point fingers and blame,
here.

37:42.120 --> 37:44.487
- I'm trying to...
- Lou: You've done it to yourself, though.

37:44.522 --> 37:46.556
You're away so much that you feel left out,

37:46.591 --> 37:49.226
and because you feel left
out you stay away longer.

37:49.260 --> 37:50.260
That... that makes no sense.

37:50.294 --> 37:52.696
It makes perfect sense to me.

37:52.730 --> 37:54.598
And then you lie about
flights being canceled

37:54.632 --> 37:56.966
to justify staying away longer.

37:57.000 --> 38:00.036
Peter: It was one time, Lou!
That was one time, you know?

38:00.070 --> 38:01.838
And I didn't say anything because
I knew you'd react like this!

38:01.872 --> 38:03.740
This is my fault because - wow! -

38:03.774 --> 38:06.109
I react badly to being lied to?!

38:06.143 --> 38:07.611
(Fire crackles)

38:11.915 --> 38:13.616
(Peter sighs)

38:18.288 --> 38:19.822
(Birds chirp, rooster crows)

38:22.659 --> 38:25.561
(Hay rustles, low hum of ATV)

38:28.965 --> 38:31.333
(ATV rumbles nearby)

38:31.368 --> 38:34.102
Man: Yah! Yah!

38:34.137 --> 38:38.574
Will: Oh! Matt!

38:38.608 --> 38:40.476
(Horses whinny) Riders: Yah! Yah!

38:40.510 --> 38:42.543
Matt, what're you doing?!

38:42.578 --> 38:44.746
(ATV rumbles) Man: Yah!

38:44.781 --> 38:47.282
(Horses whinny, ATV rumbles)

38:47.316 --> 38:49.350
(Hooves thunder)

38:49.385 --> 38:51.286
(Horses whinny)

38:51.320 --> 38:53.521
(Horses whinny)

38:56.959 --> 39:01.596
(Horses whinny)

39:01.630 --> 39:04.231
Rider: Yah! Come on! Yah!

39:04.266 --> 39:06.304
Rider 2: Keep that line!

39:06.324 --> 39:08.436
(ATV rumbles)

39:08.470 --> 39:10.320
(High-pitched whinnies)

39:11.607 --> 39:13.341
(High-pitched whinnies)

39:13.375 --> 39:14.875
Rider: Yah!

39:17.112 --> 39:20.881
(Hooves thunder, horses whinny)

39:20.916 --> 39:23.184
Rider: Got 'em, got 'em! Yah, yah, yah!

39:23.218 --> 39:25.920
Come on! Yah! Hi-yah! Hi-yah!

39:29.490 --> 39:31.434
(Gates clank shut)

39:37.398 --> 39:40.534
(Horses snort nervously) Rider: Good job.

39:40.568 --> 39:42.791
(Chain clanks, gate rattles)

39:55.930 --> 39:57.556
Amy: Hey, Will?!

39:57.576 --> 39:59.269
(Door bangs shut) Ty: Will!

39:59.289 --> 40:01.353
Amy: Will! (Phone chimes)

40:03.972 --> 40:06.740
(Ty bangs on door) Amy: Joanna, hi.

40:06.774 --> 40:09.009
Whoa. Whoa, slow down.
(Ty rattles doorknob)

40:09.043 --> 40:11.078
Don't worry, we'll find him.

40:11.112 --> 40:13.704
Okay, bye. (Phone beeps off)

40:13.724 --> 40:17.779
Matt's rounded up those horses,
and Joanna can't find her dad.

40:18.387 --> 40:20.587
Georgie: Give me something to carry, dad!

40:20.622 --> 40:22.618
(Doors bang shut) Peter: Okay!

40:25.927 --> 40:28.795
- Peter: There you go, buddy.
- Georgie: Thanks!

40:28.830 --> 40:30.797
Peter: And here's one for you, Kitty Kat.

40:30.832 --> 40:32.020
Georgie: All right, come on, Katie.
Let's go.

40:32.040 --> 40:34.735
Peter: Good job!

40:34.769 --> 40:38.571
Lou: So um... can you stay for a few days?

40:38.606 --> 40:41.508
I know that wasn't the best
"staycation" in the world,

40:41.542 --> 40:45.311
but...
the girls really love having you around.

40:45.346 --> 40:49.360
Um... can I say something here?

40:51.718 --> 40:53.914
I don't think this is working out.

40:53.934 --> 40:56.091
That's what I've been saying.
(Vehicle rumbles down driveway)

40:56.111 --> 40:57.311
Peter: Yeah.

40:57.331 --> 40:59.106
(Rumbling)

41:02.791 --> 41:04.396
Um, we need to do something about it.

41:04.430 --> 41:07.332
I agree.
Stay home more and we'll work on it.

41:07.367 --> 41:09.939
(Door opens)

41:10.845 --> 41:14.439
Peter: That's not where I
was going with this, but I...

41:14.474 --> 41:16.875
Peter: Hi. Can I help you with something?

41:16.909 --> 41:19.611
Abby: Are you Peter Morris
and Lou Flemming Morris?

41:19.646 --> 41:21.946
- Peter: Yeah.
- Abby: Abby Turnbull.

41:21.966 --> 41:24.435
I'm with the child protection society.

41:27.720 --> 41:30.822
(Metallic clanking and rattling)

41:34.526 --> 41:35.727
Ty: Hey, Will, what's your plan?

41:35.761 --> 41:38.429
Will: Let's get 'em outta here!

41:39.022 --> 41:40.732
Let's go, let's go!

41:40.766 --> 41:43.601
- Ty: Yah! Yah!
- Amy: Come on!

41:43.635 --> 41:45.170
Let's go! Get on! Yah!

41:45.204 --> 41:47.905
(ATV rumbles)

41:47.939 --> 41:50.698
Matt: Hey! What the hell are you doing?

41:52.977 --> 41:54.412
Ty: Whoa! Put the gun down, Matt!

41:54.446 --> 41:55.846
(Matt cocks the gun) Matt: Are you crazy?

41:55.880 --> 41:58.683
I told you not to fight me on this!

41:58.717 --> 42:00.218
Close the gate, Will! I mean it!

42:00.252 --> 42:02.086
(Loud gunshot blast, horses whinny)

42:02.120 --> 42:05.255
(Hooves thunder) Amy: Get 'em out!

42:05.289 --> 42:08.658
(Hooves thunder, horses whinny)

42:08.693 --> 42:10.894
Matt: You'll regret this! All o' ya!

42:10.929 --> 42:13.697
Will: (Groans)
Amy: Will?

42:13.732 --> 42:15.833
Will: I'm fine. Just keep going!
Keep 'em moving!

42:15.867 --> 42:17.367
(Horses whinny)

42:20.047 --> 42:22.439
- There's been a complaint.
- A complaint.

42:22.473 --> 42:24.407
About Georgie's living
conditions and welfare.

42:24.442 --> 42:26.409
Wh-who made this complaint?

42:26.444 --> 42:29.218
Abby: That's confidential information.

42:29.680 --> 42:31.914
You'll both need to cooperate with us fully

42:31.949 --> 42:35.092
or measures will be taken to
remove Georgie from your household.

42:35.112 --> 42:36.853
Excuse me?!

42:36.887 --> 42:38.683
(Receding footsteps)

42:43.026 --> 42:45.223
Ty: (Panting)

42:47.742 --> 42:49.927
Amy: (Laughing) Can you
believe what we just did?!

42:49.947 --> 42:51.776
(Sighs) No. I can't.

42:51.796 --> 42:54.824
That was completely awesome!

42:58.311 --> 43:00.466
(Kissing)

43:06.646 --> 43:08.942
(SUV rumbles)

43:13.289 --> 43:15.457
(SUV rumbles to a halt)

43:19.837 --> 43:21.328
(Doors bang shut)

43:21.362 --> 43:24.865
Rcmp officer: Ty Borden? Amy Fleming?

43:24.900 --> 43:27.795
You're under arrest for horse theft.

43:31.338 --> 43:32.666
Announcer: On the next Heartland.

43:32.686 --> 43:34.153
I'm with the child protection society.

43:34.173 --> 43:35.208
There's been a complaint.

43:35.228 --> 43:37.801
You're trying to take me away
from all the people that I've ever loved.

43:37.821 --> 43:39.946
Announcer: The ties that bind break apart.

43:39.948 --> 43:40.781
What do you want?

43:40.783 --> 43:43.016
Announcer: What happens next
when Heartland returns,

43:43.018 --> 43:45.919
