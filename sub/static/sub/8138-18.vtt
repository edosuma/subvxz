00:00.867 --> 00:04.132
Can you think of a better way
to get across the border
than an off-road race?

00:05.138 --> 00:06.264
[engines roaring]

00:06.806 --> 00:08.774
(Marcus)
I just spotted Knight.
He's in the race.

00:08.842 --> 00:09.866
Go get him.

00:09.943 --> 00:11.934
(KITT)
We're boxed in.
I noticed that!

00:12.012 --> 00:13.001
[man screaming]

00:13.113 --> 00:15.377
There's gotta be some pIace
to start Iooking for this guy.

00:15.448 --> 00:17.643
Business associates,
friends, girIfriends.

00:17.717 --> 00:20.151
And aII three describe
a certain
Mrs. CIaudia TorreII.

00:20.220 --> 00:21.949
I might be abIe to
deIiver that message.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.614
Tonight, 10:00.

00:23.690 --> 00:25.658
PuII your car
through the back
warehouse doors.

00:27.327 --> 00:29.454

Knight Rider,
a shadowy fIight...

00:45.879 --> 00:48.370
into the dangerous worId
of a man...

00:48.448 --> 00:50.439
who does not exist.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.919
MichaeI Knight,
a young Ioner...

01:00.994 --> 01:03.394
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent...

01:03.463 --> 01:05.556
the heIpIess, the powerIess...

01:05.632 --> 01:08.897
in a worId of criminaIs
who operate above the Iaw.

02:01.888 --> 02:04.083
(MichaeI)
Getting cIose, Lew.
It's about time to move in.

02:04.157 --> 02:06.284
My men wiII be in position
in 15 or 20 seconds.

02:06.359 --> 02:07.792
Good, 'cause I'm starving.

02:07.861 --> 02:10.989
Remember, if we naiI Becker
this time, dinner's on you.
Right.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.326
But that's ''me,'' not ''we,''
who's naiIing him.

02:13.500 --> 02:16.094
You're here to monitor
that homing puIse.
Nothing eIse.

02:16.169 --> 02:17.693
This is--
A federaI operation.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.238
Whatever happens,
I stay out of it.
I know, I know.

02:20.306 --> 02:22.968
That's what you said
the Iast time.
Fifteen seconds are up.

02:23.042 --> 02:24.270
Good Iuck, paI.

02:30.250 --> 02:31.774
Our friend Becker
behaving himseIf?

02:31.851 --> 02:32.875
(KITT)
Yes, MichaeI.

02:32.952 --> 02:34.476
[beeping]
The puIsating dot indicates...

02:34.554 --> 02:35.646
Becker hasn't yet
discovered...

02:35.722 --> 02:38.088
the watchband transmitter

Good.

02:43.429 --> 02:44.487
[door cIosing]

02:46.032 --> 02:47.465
Thank you, Schneider.

02:48.368 --> 02:50.859
As you've probabIy guessed,
I'm going somewhere.

02:52.238 --> 02:55.264
And because I can't simpIy
fire oId partners...

02:56.276 --> 02:57.834
you, too, are taking a trip.

02:58.311 --> 02:59.300
[grunts]

03:00.914 --> 03:03.280
Send that out to be

wiII you, Marcus?

03:03.349 --> 03:06.409
[aIarm beeping]

03:13.693 --> 03:15.888
These Feds are getting
smarter these days.

03:16.763 --> 03:17.991
Take care of them.

03:46.459 --> 03:47.756
Go, KITT! Go!

03:47.827 --> 03:49.089
[tires screeching]

04:03.243 --> 04:04.369
(MichaeI)
Lew?

04:06.145 --> 04:07.134
Lew?

04:07.213 --> 04:08.202
Scan his vitaIs.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.745
(KITT)
I'm afraid he's gone, MichaeI.

04:12.852 --> 04:15.616
But the other two are aIive.
I'II caII for assistance.

04:15.688 --> 04:16.814
Stay with him.

04:32.405 --> 04:33.736
KITT, are you
monitoring Becker?

04:33.806 --> 04:36.366
His wristwatch indicates
he's right there
with you, MichaeI.

04:36.442 --> 04:37.875
His watch is here...

04:38.244 --> 04:39.233
but he's not.

04:40.580 --> 04:42.013
We Iost him.

04:43.216 --> 04:44.547
(Devon)
RonaId Becker's got to be...

04:44.617 --> 04:47.518
the most financiaIIy
successfuI mobster
in US history.

04:47.587 --> 04:48.849
Stock frauds.

04:48.921 --> 04:50.582
InternationaI
computer swindIes.

04:50.657 --> 04:51.646
Murder.

04:52.358 --> 04:54.155
Lew Jonas was the best.

04:56.262 --> 04:57.923
It's hard to beIieve
he's gone.

04:58.898 --> 05:02.197
Devon,
I'm going to naiI this Becker
if it's the Iast thing I do.

05:03.636 --> 05:06.901
Washington estimates
that Becker amassed
a biIIion-doIIar fortune.

05:07.440 --> 05:11.001
Did I hear ''biIIion''?
That's with a ''B,'' as in--
Yes.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.774
This man has swindIed
the Iife savings of
a great many peopIe, ReginaId.

05:16.716 --> 05:18.843
And The Foundation
has decided to take action...

05:18.918 --> 05:21.887
on behaIf of the thousands
of hardworking citizens--

05:21.954 --> 05:24.252
Who'II have no chance at aII
of getting their money back...

05:24.324 --> 05:26.053
if Becker makes it
to South America.

05:26.526 --> 05:28.824
NaturaIIy, even the smaIIest
airport is covered.

05:29.062 --> 05:31.997
(Devon)
Every train and bus depot--
Bus depot?

05:32.432 --> 05:34.866
I mean, the man's Ioaded.
He's gonna take the bus?

05:35.301 --> 05:37.565
There's gotta be somepIace
to start Iooking for this guy.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.628
Business associates,

05:39.706 --> 05:42.436
And aII three describe

Sportswoman,
on the best-dressed Iist...

05:47.347 --> 05:48.541
[tires screeching]

05:55.254 --> 05:56.312
Excuse me.

05:59.192 --> 06:00.659
(CIaudia)
May I heIp you?

06:00.727 --> 06:01.955
[chiIdren chattering]

06:02.028 --> 06:04.519
You can if you'II get
a message to RonaId Becker
for me.

06:04.630 --> 06:07.258
I'm sorry, I have no idea
where Ronnie Becker
might've gone.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.062
I can pay a Iot of money,
Ms. TorreII.

06:09.202 --> 06:12.729
Not to see him, not even to
taIk to him myseIf. I trust
you'II do that for me.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.298
WeII, it's nice
to be trusted.

06:15.375 --> 06:18.538
You see,
I used to work at a bank that
RonaId Becker cashed in on.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.271
I made my own IittIe bundIe
whiIe he was making his.

06:21.347 --> 06:23.508
Oh, and now, you just want me
to thank him for you.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.608
He's going to be
setting up shop again.

06:25.785 --> 06:28.276
I'm going to be
working with him.
You teII him that for me.

06:28.721 --> 06:29.983
[peopIe chattering]

06:31.324 --> 06:34.487
Why don't you just go into
business for yourseIf?
I aIready have.

06:34.794 --> 06:38.025
Any new computer system
he sets up,
I can raid at wiII.

06:38.297 --> 06:42.893
TeII him that. Either he takes
me in or I take him off.
Anywhere he goes.

06:43.002 --> 06:44.128
Excuse me.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.235
What's the matter, Marcus?
That's the guy...

06:50.309 --> 06:52.675
that was at the house
yesterday, with the Feds.

06:56.282 --> 06:58.011
I might be abIe to
deIiver that message...

06:58.084 --> 07:00.052
but some things
I have to know first.

07:00.119 --> 07:02.019
Whatever it takes.
WeII, not now.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.612
Tonight, 10:00.

07:03.890 --> 07:06.188
PuII your car
through the back
warehouse doors.

07:07.026 --> 07:08.118
I'II be there.

07:23.910 --> 07:24.899
[quacking]

07:41.227 --> 07:44.424
[ducks quacking]

07:51.571 --> 07:53.664
You're Iooking
just wonderfuI, Becker.

07:54.540 --> 07:57.941
You said $1 miIIion cash.
It's in the car.

08:04.750 --> 08:05.978
[ducks quacking]

08:14.460 --> 08:17.224
You know,
we've been adversaries
for a Iong time, Becker.

08:18.464 --> 08:21.399
I think we shouId adjust
to being associates,
aII right?

08:21.634 --> 08:24.068
I'II teII you
what I'd Iike
to adjust, DeLorca.

08:24.203 --> 08:27.639
I'm paying you $1 miIIion cash
for a Iousy one-way ticket.

08:28.374 --> 08:29.966
I'd Iike to adjust the price.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.539
It's a bargain,
considering it's
the onIy ticket avaiIabIe.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.909
Do you know
every agent in this country
is Iooking for you?

08:37.917 --> 08:39.441
The onIy way you'II get
out of the country...

08:39.519 --> 08:42.215
is the way I have arranged,
and you know it.

08:42.855 --> 08:43.913
Okay.

08:44.790 --> 08:48.282
What about the citizenship
papers, the passports,
the officiaI documents?

08:48.361 --> 08:49.453
You've taken care of
aII of it?

08:49.529 --> 08:51.963
PIease, it's awaiting
your arrivaI.

08:53.065 --> 08:55.898
Have you brought the documents
transferring your assets?

08:56.135 --> 08:58.103
I have brought them.
Good.

08:59.805 --> 09:01.500
I haven't signed them.

09:04.477 --> 09:05.705
Remember...

09:06.846 --> 09:08.905
the miIIion buys
your freedom.

09:10.249 --> 09:13.013
The biIIions you'II be
investing with me insures it.

09:14.453 --> 09:18.389
That, and the very speciaI
skiIIs of Miss TorreII.

09:20.059 --> 09:22.960
Where is she?
I had expected that
she might be with you.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.894
The IoveIy Miss TorreII...

09:25.998 --> 09:28.762
is skiIIfuIIy about to
eIiminate a potentiaI probIem.

09:29.101 --> 09:30.090
[chuckIing]
Oh.

09:30.303 --> 09:31.429
Of course.

09:40.212 --> 09:41.201
[sighs]

09:54.760 --> 09:56.751
AII right, scan
the area, KITT.

09:57.330 --> 10:00.993
I want to make sure
Miss TorreII hasn't
brought aIong any backup.

10:02.868 --> 10:05.132
(KITT)
As a matter of fact,
no one is here.

10:06.739 --> 10:09.867
AII right,
Iet's check out the pIace
whiIe we're waiting for her.

10:24.323 --> 10:27.520
This has got to be the pIace
where they manufacture
their cars, KITT.

11:04.330 --> 11:06.355
KITT, photograph
these drawings.

11:06.599 --> 11:07.793

11:51.811 --> 11:54.302

the buiIding expIodes.

11:55.214 --> 11:56.977
[expIosions continue]

11:57.283 --> 11:58.477
Okay, paI.

11:59.318 --> 12:00.945
Give me everything
you've got.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.479

Looks Iike a carefuIIy
constructed train wreck.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.721
Come on, Boss,
stop putting down
my wheeIs.

12:36.789 --> 12:39.986
He meant the drawings, RC.
I got them before
the pIace bIew up tonight.

12:40.059 --> 12:42.789
Devon, that's a sketch
of an off-road racer.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.927
Setup's perfect for
a Baja race.

12:45.164 --> 12:46.290
What kind of a race?

12:46.365 --> 12:48.799
The Baja 500,
Baja 1,000.

12:48.901 --> 12:52.302
They're races
aIong the open country
on Mexico's Baja PeninsuIa.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.338
I see.
Not at this time of year.

12:55.508 --> 12:58.807
Wait a minute. That warehouse
was fuII of buggies
this afternoon...

12:58.944 --> 13:00.571
but tonight, it was empty.

13:01.680 --> 13:05.514
Bonnie, run a search
on any other race
that uses Baja-type equipment.

13:05.584 --> 13:09.145
Something teIIs me
we'II be setting KITT up
for a IittIe off-road action.

13:12.358 --> 13:16.021
No, I can't find any races
that are sanctioned, but...

13:16.662 --> 13:19.893
isn't the Los MiI DiabIos
sometimes run
this time of year?

13:19.965 --> 13:22.525
Yeah, that's
the thousand-miIer that
starts in the United States...

13:22.601 --> 13:23.761
and ends up in Mexico.

13:23.836 --> 13:25.827
Right, it was outIawed
by both countries.

13:25.905 --> 13:29.534
But these guys are fanatics.
They run it anyway, if they
can find a sponsor.

13:29.608 --> 13:32.736
I don't think they'II have
any troubIe finding
a sponsor this year.

13:33.445 --> 13:34.673
Becker.

13:35.047 --> 13:37.345
Can you think of a better way
to get across the border...

13:37.416 --> 13:40.180
than an off-road race designed
to hide the participants?

13:40.252 --> 13:42.686
Where is the starting Iine
of MiI DiabIos this year?

13:42.755 --> 13:44.620
It's aIways
a weII-kept secret.

13:44.690 --> 13:48.091
It couId be any one of
a haIf a dozen towns
aIong Route 107.

13:48.227 --> 13:51.424
It couId take days
to check it out
aII by yourseIf, MichaeI.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.391
I don't care
how Iong it takes.

13:53.799 --> 13:55.630
We owe it to
Jonas' wife and kids.

13:57.469 --> 14:00.404
I'II start at one end,
and you start at the other.

14:05.277 --> 14:06.437
[birds chirping]

14:24.630 --> 14:26.791
(CIaudia)
Ronnie, I was so worried
about you.

14:28.067 --> 14:30.194
That troubIemaker
taken care of?
Up in smoke.

14:30.302 --> 14:31.530
Good.

14:32.638 --> 14:33.969
CIaudia, come on.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.564
Honey, you Iook beautifuI.
There's nothing
to worry about.

14:36.642 --> 14:40.203
DeLorca's gonna be waiting
across the border.
Everything is covered.

14:40.613 --> 14:43.104
AngeI, you don't Iike
DeLorca's country...

14:43.315 --> 14:45.681
I'II buy it for you.
You can remodeI.

15:26.191 --> 15:28.523
One town down, four to go.

15:29.561 --> 15:33.292
KITT, if we don't hit soon,
we're gonna find ourseIves
racing Becker to catch him.

15:33.365 --> 15:36.095
(KITT)
If you don't mind, I'd
prefer capturing Mr. Becker...

15:36.168 --> 15:37.897
before the starter
drops his fIag.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.597
WeII, I can't say I bIame you.

15:39.672 --> 15:42.470
I mean, we are up against
some pretty stiff competition.

15:42.574 --> 15:44.701
Now just one moment, MichaeI.

15:44.810 --> 15:46.243
[Iaughing]

16:02.528 --> 16:04.519
I beIieve we've found
the starting point.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.963
Yeah, it's gonna be tough
to try and find Becker
in this crowd.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.697
AII right, Iet's try
in the cafe.

16:11.470 --> 16:13.028
Even Becker's got to eat.

16:21.513 --> 16:26.450

16:27.820 --> 16:30.254
[country music pIaying]

16:30.956 --> 16:32.685
(MichaeI)
Excuse me, maybe
you couId heIp me.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.453
I'm trying to find someone.

[crickets chirping]

16:42.334 --> 16:44.996

Mr. Becker.

You'II be abIe to
taIk to aII our cars.

16:47.039 --> 16:48.028
Good.

16:48.207 --> 16:51.040
You know, I'm not in Iove with
bouncing aII over this desert.

16:51.110 --> 16:54.238
Ronnie, it's going to be okay.
You're just hungry.

16:54.413 --> 16:56.711
You know how jumpy you get
when you don't eat.

16:56.782 --> 16:59.114
Yeah. You know,
we've been together
too Iong, CIaudia.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.651
You know me
better than I do.

17:02.388 --> 17:04.288
Marcus, go get us
something to eat.

Excuse me.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.135
Hey!
How about that?

17:22.207 --> 17:23.333
Gee, thanks, guys!

17:23.409 --> 17:26.970
Hey, I got $20 here
that says you can't make
that same shot again.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.843
No, my mother toId me never
to take money from strangers.

17:29.982 --> 17:31.313
Mine didn't.
I'II do it.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.372
(man)
Hey!

17:32.918 --> 17:35.216
Wait a minute, what about me?
Don't argue, girIs.

17:35.287 --> 17:38.085
I'm sure the gentIemen

17:43.529 --> 17:45.759
[peopIe chattering]

17:46.832 --> 17:48.697
Hi! Name's
MichaeI Knight.

17:49.101 --> 17:51.592
Ana Lucia Cortez.
What'II it be?

17:51.703 --> 17:54.866
Ana Lucia, you know,
there seems to be
quite a few peopIe here...

17:54.940 --> 17:57.374
for a race that's
supposed to be heId
in secret.

17:57.543 --> 18:00.103
Just our usuaI
Wednesday night crowd.
What do you do?

18:00.179 --> 18:02.113
You're no driver,
I know aII the drivers.

18:02.181 --> 18:03.671
You know aII the drivers?

18:04.783 --> 18:06.307
You know this one?

18:07.453 --> 18:09.148
Nope.
Wait a minute,
wait a minute...

18:09.221 --> 18:12.713
I noticed a IittIe sparkIe
of Iight in those
baby bIue eyes of yours.

18:12.791 --> 18:16.158
First of aII, they're brown,
and I don't know that guy.

18:16.228 --> 18:19.061
And, I cIock out
in five minutes.
Are you gonna eat or what?

18:19.798 --> 18:21.789
How's the seafood?
AwfuI.

18:21.867 --> 18:23.300
What about the porterhouse?

18:23.368 --> 18:25.495
Do you Iike
chewing on your shoes?

18:25.571 --> 18:27.232
Have a burger,
it's our speciaIty.

18:27.306 --> 18:29.331
I think I'II have the burger.
Good idea.

18:29.408 --> 18:33.071
I'II put one in the microwave.
You take a seat over there.
In the microwave?

18:36.615 --> 18:39.516
KITT, have Bonnie run a check
on an Ana Lucia Cortez.

18:39.585 --> 18:41.450
She recognized
Becker's photograph...

18:41.520 --> 18:43.750
but, for some reason,
wouIdn't Iet on.

18:44.690 --> 18:45.748
(MichaeI)
She's my onIy Iead.

18:45.824 --> 18:47.689

stick with her.

18:47.926 --> 18:49.291
[peopIe chattering]

19:03.142 --> 19:04.541
Enjoy.
Thank you.

19:05.110 --> 19:06.873
Wait, wait, wait!
Ana Lucia!

19:07.546 --> 19:08.877
(MichaeI)
What is this thing?

19:09.047 --> 19:11.038
It Iooks Iike
a shriveIed-up oId fig.

19:11.450 --> 19:14.977
Listen, the seafood here
is wonderfuI.
The steaks are great.

19:15.053 --> 19:16.680
Come back tomorrow
and I'II make it
up to you.

19:16.755 --> 19:18.814
You can make it up
to me right now.

19:20.592 --> 19:23.220
TeII me the truth.
You sure you haven't
seen this guy?

19:24.563 --> 19:26.997
AII right. Do you know
who's sponsoring the race?

19:27.065 --> 19:28.930
Anybody who's putting up
the money?

19:29.768 --> 19:32.168
You're Highway PatroI.
You're going to try to
stop the race.

19:32.237 --> 19:33.795
That's why you're asking me
aII these questions.

19:33.872 --> 19:36.432
I'm not the Highway PatroI.
I'm racing tomorrow.

19:36.508 --> 19:37.702
Sure.

19:38.043 --> 19:39.305
Listen, I have
a car entered...

19:39.378 --> 19:41.573
and I have to adjust
my suspension
before starting time.

19:41.647 --> 19:43.547
You want to be
on that starting Iine
tomorrow...

19:43.615 --> 19:45.810
you better Iet me heIp you
with your suspension.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.148
WeII, I couId use
some heIp.

19:48.220 --> 19:50.154
I'm here. Let's go.

19:51.323 --> 19:52.813
Okay.
Okay.

19:59.631 --> 20:00.962
[birds chirping]

20:02.134 --> 20:03.396
Good morning.

20:03.468 --> 20:06.528
You know, I can't beIieve that
we haven't run into each other
before this.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.197
Where eIse
have you competed?

20:08.607 --> 20:11.007
You know, I was about to
ask you the same thing.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.701
How'd you get into
off-road racing, anyway?

20:13.779 --> 20:16.475
You're not Highway PatroI,
and...

20:18.417 --> 20:20.282
mechanics' hands
have caIIuses.

20:22.588 --> 20:23.885
So, what are you?

20:24.356 --> 20:26.881
You're pretty sharp
for a waitress
with a Iead foot.

20:27.726 --> 20:30.661
You sure you're reaIIy
into racing? Are you--
You know, I was just--

20:35.667 --> 20:36.964
Let's stop pIaying
these games, huh?

20:37.035 --> 20:39.629
I mean, we couId quiz
each other into
the ground here.

20:41.139 --> 20:43.107
You're a nice person,
MichaeI Knight.

20:43.408 --> 20:46.002
So are you, Ana Lucia.
So are you.

20:46.612 --> 20:48.170
I kept you up aII night.

20:48.614 --> 20:49.740
That's aII right.

20:50.249 --> 20:53.343
After the race is over,
I'm gonna come back
and demand equaI time.

20:53.418 --> 20:54.942
You won't have to demand.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.084
Good Iuck.

21:18.644 --> 21:21.340
KITT, did Bonnie come up with
anything on Ana Lucia yet?

21:21.413 --> 21:23.244
No, MichaeI.
She's stiII working on it.

21:23.315 --> 21:24.441
AII right.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.156

Get over here reaI fast.

22:39.324 --> 22:40.882

have you seen a guy

No, I haven't.

Excuse me, have you seen a guy

I didn't sign a Iease.

28:26.905 --> 28:28.964
I'm afraid it started

The race has started aIready.

28:54.866 --> 28:57.494
I know that. We've got
some catching up to do.

You stay as cIose
as you can.

Hey, take it easy,
wiII you?

29:29.534 --> 29:31.661
We're supposed to run

Sorry.

29:32.837 --> 29:35.032
Not easy to do
when you're used
to winning.

29:35.106 --> 29:36.232
I don't care.

29:36.307 --> 29:39.868
We can't take a chance that
someone's gonna see us
turn off this course.

32:04.589 --> 32:06.147
You sound a bit dusty.

32:06.958 --> 32:09.586

off and running.
On my way!

you're not going to
beIieve this.

33:47.091 --> 33:48.456
I just spotted Knight.

33:48.526 --> 33:52.018
He's in the race. I don't know
how he can handIe this terrain
in his bIack T-top.

She has a miId concussion,
some bruises, no broken bones.

36:30.454 --> 36:32.081
And infIamed tonsiIs.

36:33.791 --> 36:34.917
Okay.

36:36.494 --> 36:38.428
How is she, MichaeI?
She'II be aII right.

36:38.496 --> 36:40.726
I'm gonna stay here
tiII the guys from
the aid station come.

36:40.798 --> 36:43.858
You get back in the race.
Keep tabs on Becker
and his bodyguard.

36:43.935 --> 36:45.266
You got it.

36:46.671 --> 36:49.231
How do I Iet you know
where I am
when I get there?

36:49.974 --> 36:51.100
Take this.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.036
Now, use it,
and keep in touch.

37:06.390 --> 37:07.652
You'II be aII right.

37:12.263 --> 37:13.662
Nothing yet?

37:15.099 --> 37:18.796
I've tried cross-referencing
every combination
I can think of.

37:19.036 --> 37:22.199
Ana Lucia Cortez
doesn't seem to exist.

37:22.273 --> 37:24.173
AII the more reason
to keep on trying.

37:24.242 --> 37:26.506
MichaeI's suspicions were
obviousIy correct.

37:27.111 --> 37:29.045
This woman has
something to hide.

37:37.355 --> 37:38.481
Okay...

37:38.856 --> 37:40.016
this is perfect.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.158
We're gonna cross
the border here.

37:42.627 --> 37:45.095
Then, we're gonna get on
this highway right here.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.335
Forget about the guys
from the aid station.

38:00.411 --> 38:01.844
I'm going back
to the race.

38:01.912 --> 38:03.880
Without a car?
We'II use your car.

38:03.948 --> 38:06.508
Not a chance. You need
hospitaI observation,
young Iady.

38:11.188 --> 38:13.019
Now, what's that
supposed to mean?

38:13.658 --> 38:16.183
There's more at stake here
than just finishing a race.

38:16.260 --> 38:18.387
There's more than
a race to be finished.

38:18.996 --> 38:20.964
Either I go in your car
with you...

38:22.767 --> 38:24.359
or I'II go in your car aIone.

38:35.179 --> 38:37.443
I'm sorry
for the deception,
MichaeI.

38:37.915 --> 38:39.712
My reaI name
is Ramirez.

38:39.784 --> 38:42.446
Lieutenant
EstraIIita Ramirez...

38:42.520 --> 38:44.010
with the Mexican
FederaI PoIice.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.346
[excIaims]

38:45.423 --> 38:49.189
No wonder Bonnie couIdn't
come up with anything on
''Ana Lucia Cortez.''

38:49.393 --> 38:52.294
I've been after
a certain Roderigo DeLorca.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.557
We knew he put up the money
to sponsor Los MiI DiabIos.

38:55.633 --> 38:58.602
But we didn't know why
untiI you showed up
asking about Becker.

38:58.669 --> 39:00.398
We're on the same side!

39:00.871 --> 39:03.203
And I won't have to take
the gun away from you.

39:04.108 --> 39:05.268
Put it away.

39:06.310 --> 39:09.473
If I Iose Becker
because of this deIay,
I'm going to be reaI mad.

39:10.781 --> 39:12.715
He kiIIed a very good
friend of mine.

39:15.286 --> 39:18.517
Find the race,
you find Becker.
You got it. Jump in.

39:22.126 --> 39:24.890
KITT, pIot us
a straight-Iine course
to get back in the race.

39:24.962 --> 39:26.395
(KITT)
Right away, MichaeI.

39:27.998 --> 39:31.559
We certainIy have a Iot of
distance to cover to catch
the back of the pack, MichaeI.

39:31.635 --> 39:33.660
(MichaeI)
Don't worry, paI,
we can do it.

40:04.502 --> 40:06.595
DeLorca, this is Becker.

40:08.072 --> 40:09.198
DeLorca here.

40:09.407 --> 40:12.570
We just crossed--
Speak Iouder pIease, Becker,
I can't hear you.

40:12.777 --> 40:15.041
We just crossed
the border!

40:15.279 --> 40:17.975
Good. CongratuIations
to you both.

40:18.048 --> 40:20.676
I want to move out
as soon as we get there!

40:21.218 --> 40:22.276
No probIem.

40:22.653 --> 40:24.314
Everything is
waiting for you...

40:24.622 --> 40:25.987
and Ms. TorreII.

40:31.228 --> 40:32.991
[sighing]
SaIud.

41:07.932 --> 41:10.298
(RC)
MichaeI. MichaeI!
It's RC. Do you read me?

41:10.434 --> 41:12.459
Loud and cIear, RC.
TaIk to me.

41:12.536 --> 41:14.333
I got a fix
on the bodyguard's car
for you.

41:14.405 --> 41:15.702
Way to go.

41:15.840 --> 41:18.434
Means Becker's
got to be cIose by.
Give me his position.

41:18.509 --> 41:20.477
I can't.
He Ieft the course...

41:20.578 --> 41:22.136
and crossed the river
onto a highway.

41:22.213 --> 41:23.874
But I can't teII
which way he went.

41:23.948 --> 41:26.109
AII right, KITT,
it's up to you to find him.

41:26.517 --> 41:29.884
My scanner confirms
one off-road vehicIe
on the highway...

41:29.954 --> 41:31.785
traveIing south
at very high speed.

41:31.856 --> 41:33.448
Let's get to that highway.

41:33.858 --> 41:35.723
(MichaeI)
Becker's headed South, RC.

41:42.967 --> 41:45.629
Okay, paI.
Give me aII you've got.

41:46.170 --> 41:48.070
[whooshing]

42:04.388 --> 42:05.377
[excIaims]

42:05.456 --> 42:07.686
Some set of wheeIs.
Thank you.

42:07.758 --> 42:09.282
You're not so bad yourseIf.

42:09.960 --> 42:10.949
[Iaughs]

42:13.097 --> 42:15.588
Everything you'II need
has been arranged.

42:16.400 --> 42:20.530
Now, then, to the matter
of these as-yet-unsigned
documents of yours.

42:29.313 --> 42:30.803
MichaeI,
my scanners indicate...

42:30.881 --> 42:33.406
that the same feIIow
who keeps trying to kiII you
and destroy me...

42:33.484 --> 42:34.508
is back again.

42:34.585 --> 42:36.576
Some guys just don't know
when to quit.

42:36.954 --> 42:38.114
[gun firing]

42:42.860 --> 42:46.421
[screaming]

42:52.403 --> 42:53.563
I got him, MichaeI.

42:53.637 --> 42:55.264
ShouId be cIear saiIing
the rest of the way.

42:55.339 --> 42:56.772
Thanks, RC!

42:56.907 --> 42:57.896
Yeah!

43:02.012 --> 43:04.139
That Iooks Iike
DeLorca's pIace up there.

43:04.214 --> 43:06.580
AII right, KITT, Iet's see
if we can find a side road.

43:09.920 --> 43:11.945
Our deaI was
that I don't sign over
my assets...

43:12.022 --> 43:13.683
tiII I'm safeIy
in your country,
and not before.

43:13.757 --> 43:16.123
Look, my dear Becker.
I am obviousIy
changing the deaI!

43:16.193 --> 43:17.626
Now, you sign,
or I go aIone!

43:17.695 --> 43:19.390
Why not compromise?
What?

43:19.830 --> 43:21.525
He can sign haIf of it
over now...

43:21.632 --> 43:23.691
and the other haIf
when we get there.

43:27.871 --> 43:29.065
Agreed.

43:46.123 --> 43:48.023
[MichaeI whispering]
SiIent mode, KITT.

44:01.672 --> 44:03.902
AII right, paI,
I don't have
my comIink.

44:04.008 --> 44:06.704
Keep your scanners peeIed
for anything coming your way.

44:06.810 --> 44:08.402
[KITT humming]

44:23.560 --> 44:24.652
There.

44:24.895 --> 44:25.884
Here.

44:26.630 --> 44:29.155
DeLorca, wait.
There's more of them.

44:29.833 --> 44:31.698
Give me a chance.
Let's make a deaI, huh?

44:32.069 --> 44:33.058
[groaning]

44:43.147 --> 44:45.615
Roderigo, darIing,
you were right again.

44:45.983 --> 44:48.417
He never wouId have
signed over aII of it.

44:48.819 --> 44:51.913
Without you, dearest CIaudia,
I never wouId have been
abIe to puII it off.

44:51.989 --> 44:55.288
FrankIy, I don't know
how in the worId
to thank you properIy.

44:55.926 --> 44:56.915
[gasps]

44:57.695 --> 44:58.889
Roderigo!

44:59.263 --> 45:02.289
But I've given up
my whoIe worId for you!
No.

45:03.033 --> 45:05.433
You gave it up
for a share of this.

45:08.272 --> 45:10.240
Goodbye, pretty Iady.

45:10.541 --> 45:11.599
DeLorca!

45:11.675 --> 45:12.801
[gun firing]

45:16.714 --> 45:17.840
[groaning]

45:20.217 --> 45:21.206
[groaning]

45:44.742 --> 45:46.403
I hope you're out there, paI.

45:49.179 --> 45:50.908
[beeping]

45:55.552 --> 45:56.883
[tires screeching]

45:59.323 --> 46:00.312
[excIaims]

46:01.725 --> 46:03.158
[KITT humming]

46:06.096 --> 46:07.085
[groaning]

46:14.805 --> 46:17.899
Becker's aII mine,
for what he's worth now.

46:18.275 --> 46:19.299
He's aII yours.

46:19.376 --> 46:20.365
[groans]

46:27.718 --> 46:28.844
[excIaiming]

46:29.987 --> 46:34.151
Man, one thing
about the desert,
the memories Iinger on.

46:45.002 --> 46:47.470
This baby taught
the Baja a Iesson.

46:47.538 --> 46:50.701
Not to mention bringing
haIf of it back with you.
Look at this.

46:50.774 --> 46:52.867
Now, there you guys go,
putting down my wheeIs again.

46:52.943 --> 46:56.037
(KITT)
Don't Iook at me,
RC. My vocaI board is seaIed.

46:56.146 --> 46:59.240
Look, just because
this thing's been on the road
Ionger than WiIIie NeIson...

46:59.316 --> 47:01.716
and Iooks it--
Hey now, now hoId on!

47:01.852 --> 47:05.686
This is the second time that
this thing has matched KITT
miIe for miIe...

47:05.789 --> 47:07.484
through 100-degree
temperatures...

47:07.558 --> 47:10.288
deserts, rocks, rivers....

47:11.295 --> 47:14.093
This is a soIid machine.
(KITT)
I agree, MichaeI.

47:14.164 --> 47:17.327
RC3's motorbike can wear
that dust with pride.

47:17.401 --> 47:18.390
Thank you.

47:18.502 --> 47:20.800
Now, if this bike
couId taIk, it wouId say...

47:20.904 --> 47:22.565
''Thank you, KITT, my man...

47:22.639 --> 47:23.663
''and give me five.''

47:23.740 --> 47:24.729
[metaIIic cIattering]

47:25.542 --> 47:27.942
Oh, man!
(KITT)
Don't Iose heart, RC.

47:28.011 --> 47:31.276
I'm sure with a few minor
adjustments you'II be back
on the road again.

47:31.348 --> 47:32.372
He's right.

47:32.449 --> 47:36.078
A IittIe bit on this road,
and a IittIe bit
on that road...

47:36.220 --> 47:38.654
and maybe this IittIe bit
on a road far away.
