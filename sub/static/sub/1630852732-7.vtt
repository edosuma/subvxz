WEBVTT

00:26.359 --> 00:28.570
Who left him unattended?
Oh my God.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.325
Check his pulse.

00:37.370 --> 00:39.581
-Weak, but alive.
-We need to get him to the medical unit.

00:39.664 --> 00:41.374
-Get the gurney.
-I'm on it.

00:57.474 --> 01:00.060
-Pulse is fading. We're losing him.
-Let's go, let's go!

01:00.143 --> 01:04.647
Fast car ready at the ESS.
I'm gonna need Chem 8, Utox, UA, LFTs!

02:43.830 --> 02:46.416
-Wake up, Bug.
-Mm-mm.

02:46.499 --> 02:49.294
-Big day today.
-No, it's not.

02:49.377 --> 02:51.713
Yes, it is. Wake up.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.384
Hey, don't be sad.

02:57.093 --> 02:59.512
I'm sad too, but I'm here now,

03:00.221 --> 03:01.931
and I want today to be special.

03:05.143 --> 03:06.477
I don't.

03:07.896 --> 03:09.606
I don't want today to be anything.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.359
I can't wait to hear you sing.

03:13.943 --> 03:16.779
Kwame told me that you have
a solo in the opening number.

03:18.615 --> 03:19.449
What?

03:20.033 --> 03:21.618
I don't wanna sing that song.

03:21.701 --> 03:24.412
It's called "Steppin' to the Bad Side,"
and I'm a hero.

03:25.747 --> 03:28.458
Yeah, sometimes bad guys step to you.

03:29.167 --> 03:30.418
So you gotta step to them.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.630
Can I just stay with you?

03:35.340 --> 03:36.966
I have to take care
of some things.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.219
-What is more important than--
-Hey, listen.

03:41.095 --> 03:44.182
I want to spend every waking moment
I have left with you,

03:45.683 --> 03:51.773
but I gotta put some things
and-and people together for you.

03:52.607 --> 03:53.483
For your future.

03:54.734 --> 03:57.403
So that I'll know
you'll never have to go at it alone.

04:02.784 --> 04:06.412
Besides, if you spent
your whole day with me,

04:06.496 --> 04:08.498
how are you gonna
ride your bike to school?

04:10.333 --> 04:11.209
By myself?

04:11.834 --> 04:13.628
By yourself.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.046
I'd say it's about that time.

05:16.024 --> 05:17.817
Did you ride your bike to school today?

05:21.279 --> 05:23.239
-Mm-hm.
-All by yourself?

05:24.449 --> 05:25.867
-Yup.
-This is a big day.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.952
You've been dreaming of this for so long.

05:28.453 --> 05:31.456
-Was it everything you hoped it would be?
-It was cool.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.459
Why aren't you more excited?

05:34.542 --> 05:36.794
I wish I could drive myself to school.

05:36.878 --> 05:39.172
But I have to wait
until I get my driver's license,

05:39.255 --> 05:40.798
and my own tricked out van.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.383
It's gonna be pink, by the way.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.679
What's wrong?

05:46.763 --> 05:49.974
Your mom is finally letting you grow up.
Isn't that what you wanted?

05:51.559 --> 05:53.686
I wouldn't mind
holding off a little bit longer.

05:56.856 --> 05:58.107
Ready for the show tonight?

05:58.775 --> 06:02.070
I'm gonna need you and Jonathan
backstage with me before I go on.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.447
-We'll be there.
-Yes.

06:11.871 --> 06:15.333
We've been able to stabilize him,
but I'm not gonna lie,

06:15.833 --> 06:17.543
we're in uncharted territory here.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.880
-Can he even hear us?
-His EEG is flat.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.425
I don't think he's coming back.

06:25.635 --> 06:26.886
Is he brain-dead?

06:26.969 --> 06:30.807
A coma this deep could mean
that his mind is rebuilding itself,

06:30.890 --> 06:33.184
but that might take a while.

06:33.267 --> 06:35.812
And we have no idea what
that Powered DNA might be doing to him.

06:35.895 --> 06:40.775
True. Yeah. His breathing's erratic.
His heart rate is up and then down.

06:40.858 --> 06:44.153
There's some weird CNS electrical surge.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.988
What's this bottom line here?

06:46.572 --> 06:50.618
In highly scientific terms,
either he's turning into Superman,

06:50.701 --> 06:52.745
or disintegrating from the inside out.

07:14.475 --> 07:18.438
I just don't understand how,
knowing what you know,

07:18.521 --> 07:22.483
you can just sit here eating lunch.

07:22.567 --> 07:24.026
I'm hungry.

07:24.527 --> 07:27.530
-Here you go. Enjoy.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.573
Thank you.

07:33.744 --> 07:36.038
Um, there's something I wanted to ask you.

07:37.832 --> 07:38.666
Um…

07:39.625 --> 07:42.378
-I don't really know what to call it.
-A favor?

07:44.046 --> 07:46.257
Yeah. It's about Dion.

07:47.383 --> 07:50.303
You know they say
it takes a village to raise a child.

07:51.679 --> 07:54.056
So I'm using what time I have left
to build one.

07:55.016 --> 07:58.269
-You want <i>me </i>to raise Dion?
-My sister is gonna do that.

08:00.480 --> 08:02.023
But I would love your help.

08:03.649 --> 08:05.943
BIONA is gonna be
a big part of Dion's life.

08:06.611 --> 08:10.323
That's a good thing. But I…
I don't want him to grow up in a lab.

08:10.948 --> 08:14.911
Or spend all of his free time
with employees of a corporation

08:14.994 --> 08:17.497
that might not always
have his best interests at heart.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.457
I don't want that for Janelle either.

08:23.252 --> 08:25.254
So while you're looking out for Janelle,

08:26.797 --> 08:28.299
can you look out for Dion too?

08:30.551 --> 08:32.678
I know we don't know each other
that well, but…

08:33.513 --> 08:35.515
No, no, I get it.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.017
We're part of a very specific club.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.396
You've been a lifesaver for me, Nicole.

08:43.064 --> 08:46.192
You got through to my daughter,
brought her out of her shell,

08:46.692 --> 08:49.362
and for the first time
in I can't tell you how long, I…

08:49.445 --> 08:51.030
kind of think she's gonna be okay.

08:51.113 --> 08:55.201
-Janelle is gonna be unstoppable.
-I owe you so much. So whatever I can do.

08:56.994 --> 08:57.828
Thank you.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.499
But, look, I don't want you
to agree to this

09:01.582 --> 09:03.834
until you understand
the danger that's in it.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.127
Dion's not violent.

09:05.211 --> 09:07.463
No. Of course not.

09:09.173 --> 09:14.929
But there's a Powered entity
that has targeted Dion,

09:15.513 --> 09:17.515
and it's killed a lot of Powered people.

09:17.598 --> 09:19.600
But it hasn't been able to hurt him, and

09:20.685 --> 09:22.436
I think it sees him as a threat.

09:24.605 --> 09:25.439
To what?

09:25.523 --> 09:27.608
Whatever it has planned
for the future.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.360
Why Dion?

09:29.443 --> 09:31.946
Because I think
Dion has what it takes to destroy it.

09:34.865 --> 09:37.535
He's the only one
that's fought it and lived.

09:38.494 --> 09:43.124
But he's just a kid.
He needs time to develop his powers.

09:46.335 --> 09:50.840
Every Powered person is at risk
as long as that thing is out there.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.636
You just need to keep Dion safe

09:55.720 --> 09:58.848
so that he can grow up
and destroy it for good.

10:01.851 --> 10:04.895
Wow. Uh, that was… a lot.

10:04.979 --> 10:06.939
Um, just tell me you'll think about it.

10:09.066 --> 10:09.984
Of course.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.404
But don't take too long.

10:18.367 --> 10:20.620
We're coming to Dion's show tonight.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.163
So can we talk then?

10:24.498 --> 10:25.374
Of course we can.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.598
I'm so sorry this is happening to you.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.398
Okay, Janelle. This is boss-level stuff.

10:51.525 --> 10:52.735
Multiple objects,

10:52.818 --> 10:54.695
and for an added level of difficulty,

10:55.738 --> 10:58.574
wildly differing masses
and molecular structures.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.117
Are you up for this?

11:00.201 --> 11:02.203
Bring it.

11:02.286 --> 11:05.039
-I'm ready to dematerialize.
-That's what I like to hear.

11:15.466 --> 11:19.011
-Yes.
-Yes! That's what I'm talking about.

11:19.595 --> 11:22.056
-See?
-I'm so proud of you. Want to go again?

11:22.139 --> 11:23.474
Yeah.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.643
How about we call it early today?

11:25.726 --> 11:28.312
Dion's show is tonight,
so we need to get going.

11:29.146 --> 11:31.315
Uh, yeah, don't wanna be late for that.

11:32.066 --> 11:34.694
Uh, we'll disintegrate some stuff
another time.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.903
Okay.

11:42.034 --> 11:44.286
Janelle, hey.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.204
Hi.

11:45.287 --> 11:46.997
I-I wasn't watching.

11:47.081 --> 11:49.083
N-No, you can watch. It's fine.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.168
Really? I…
I thought you hated that.

11:51.669 --> 11:53.254
That was before.

11:53.921 --> 11:55.798
I just didn't want you
to think I was a freak.

11:59.176 --> 12:01.637
So, of course,
I started acting more like a freak.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.433
Um, here, I just, um…

12:06.058 --> 12:07.977
I just, uh, airdropped you a playlist.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.062
Oh, wow.

12:12.565 --> 12:15.192
I'm sorry. I just really wanted
you to hear this. Um…

12:16.026 --> 12:16.902
I'm in a band.

12:18.112 --> 12:19.363
We're… We're pretty good.

12:20.281 --> 12:23.367
-Aristotle's Backpack.
-Yeah, our-our lyrics are insane.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.370
Anyway, uh, listen.

12:27.955 --> 12:30.249
I don't know if your mom lets you hang out

12:30.332 --> 12:32.918
or if you want to hang out,

12:33.002 --> 12:36.505
but I'd be down
if you would want to, you know, uh--

12:36.589 --> 12:37.590
Yeah.

12:37.673 --> 12:38.883
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

12:39.842 --> 12:40.885
-Yeah.
-Great.

12:40.968 --> 12:43.512
I'm going to Dion's show tonight,
actually, but I mean--

12:43.596 --> 12:46.432
-Me too.
-Okay, great. Yeah. I'll, um…

12:47.308 --> 12:49.435
-I'll save you a seat?
-Okay.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.104
-Okay.

12:58.861 --> 12:59.695
Huh.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.864
<i>So are you going</i>
<i>to the show tonight?</i>

13:01.947 --> 13:03.491
Mm-hm. Yeah. Wouldn't miss it.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.118
Or Nicole?

13:10.080 --> 13:12.082
It's happening pretty fast, isn't it?

13:14.710 --> 13:15.544
Yeah.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.546
She'll be gone by tomorrow.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.926
Did you talk to her about the village?

13:22.009 --> 13:26.722
Simone, I'm… I'm the mayor
of said village.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.766
Looking to relocate?

13:31.060 --> 13:32.895
It does look like a nice village.

13:34.146 --> 13:35.397
Hey. Let's go, Mom.

13:37.358 --> 13:38.609
I'll see you there.

13:45.241 --> 13:48.160
Mom, my sessions with Tevin
just keep getting better and better.

13:48.244 --> 13:49.870
I have so much more control.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.330
It's like somebody flipped a switch

13:51.413 --> 13:53.624
and suddenly
I'm on the other side of my abilities.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.085
Good. That's good.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.838
It is. And you know what? I had an idea.

13:58.921 --> 14:01.966
You know how Nicole asked me to represent
the Powered on the Advisory Board?

14:02.466 --> 14:03.551
Well, I wanna do more.

14:04.051 --> 14:05.845
I want to mentor Powered kids, like Dion.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.097
I'm sorry. What are you talking about?

14:08.848 --> 14:11.141
Well, the Powered adults,
you know, they're cool,

14:11.225 --> 14:13.352
but kids want to talk
to other kids, you know?

14:13.435 --> 14:15.563
We have our own stuff
that we're dealing with,

14:15.646 --> 14:17.940
and Dion and I, we have a lot in common.

14:18.023 --> 14:20.693
He's an only child and I'm an only child.

14:20.776 --> 14:24.864
I could be like his big sister, you know?
Show him the ropes, scare off the bullies.

14:24.947 --> 14:25.781
No.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.283
No?

14:27.366 --> 14:32.121
You need to worry about yourself first.
You're just getting started with all this.

14:32.204 --> 14:34.373
You don't need to be mentoring anybody.

14:34.456 --> 14:37.459
-Why do you always have to be so negative?
-I'm not negative.

14:39.169 --> 14:41.797
It's just things are happening very fast

14:42.464 --> 14:46.135
and I think we need to be very careful
about committing ourselves to other people

14:46.218 --> 14:47.845
before we know what we're doing.

14:50.764 --> 14:51.849
Never mind.

14:52.808 --> 14:55.811
Do we have time to go home?
I want to change before the show.

14:57.897 --> 14:58.731
Yeah.

14:59.732 --> 15:01.650
I need to pick up a few things myself.

15:17.249 --> 15:18.709
<i>Hi, Bug.</i>

15:19.877 --> 15:23.005
So your dad used
to make these videos for me,

15:23.088 --> 15:25.716
and now you're making
the videos for Dad, so…

15:25.799 --> 15:28.510
…it's my turn.

15:28.594 --> 15:29.970
Because this one's for you.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.807
When you see this…

15:35.851 --> 15:39.521
you're gonna have a lot of questions,
and I won't be there to answer them.

15:41.023 --> 15:44.109
But I <i>can</i> tell you this.

15:47.905 --> 15:51.283
<i>I always keep a coffee can</i>

15:52.326 --> 15:55.329
<i>with 100 dollars</i>
<i>tucked at the very back of the pantry.</i>

15:58.582 --> 16:00.542
Why did I lead with that?

16:00.626 --> 16:03.921
You're just gonna buy
100 dollars-worth of Twix bars.

16:04.838 --> 16:05.756
But you know what?

16:06.799 --> 16:07.633
Enjoy.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.886
Just make sure
you don't eat them all in the same day.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.649
I can tell you
where I stashed the insurance papers

16:24.483 --> 16:25.776
<i>and the extra checkbooks.</i>

16:35.869 --> 16:38.497
And, by the way,
your passport's expired.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.416
<i>I'm really, really sorry about that.</i>

16:44.878 --> 16:50.426
I even wrote down the recipe
for your favorite mac and cheese.

16:51.385 --> 16:54.763
But, Dion, you have to promise me,
please never, never forget,

16:56.056 --> 16:58.726
sharp cheddar is for flavor.

16:58.809 --> 17:02.813
Colby Jack is for that
below-the-surface mouthfeel.

17:03.731 --> 17:10.029
Mozzarella is for the stringy-melty…
American cheese for the golden crust.

17:10.112 --> 17:13.741
And then, cream cheese
for that extra special flavor,

17:13.824 --> 17:17.494
and I'm not talking about
the bougie garlic and chives cream cheese.

17:17.578 --> 17:19.163
I'm talking Philadelphia.

17:19.246 --> 17:22.166
Because, "If it ain't broke,
don't fix it."

17:25.919 --> 17:27.671
There's so much I want to tell you.

17:29.465 --> 17:33.427
You gotta let the girl know
if it's gonna be a date.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.389
And when you have kids of your own,

17:38.474 --> 17:40.017
hide the Sharpies.

17:47.357 --> 17:49.735
You're gonna have to grow up…

17:52.071 --> 17:54.406
a lot faster than you should.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.660
But you're gonna be okay.

18:00.412 --> 18:03.791
And even if you're not okay…

18:06.126 --> 18:07.127
that's okay.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.255
Because you have a great heart,

18:11.131 --> 18:12.299
powers or no powers.

18:16.678 --> 18:17.554
Huh.

18:19.681 --> 18:20.849
Being your mom…

18:23.811 --> 18:27.314
has, hands down,
been one of the greatest things I've ever…

19:06.103 --> 19:08.647
Should we wait
for Chairman Cutler to join us?

19:08.730 --> 19:09.857
As of this morning,

19:09.940 --> 19:12.693
Mr. Cutler is stepping back
from his duties as chairman.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.154
Oh.

19:17.573 --> 19:21.118
But the board is very intrigued
by your urgent appeal.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.579
We're all ears. Proceed when ready.

19:28.667 --> 19:32.087
In our work to create
a cure for the parasitic infection

19:32.171 --> 19:33.630
afflicting Nicole Warren,

19:35.048 --> 19:37.217
we have identified the primary difference

19:37.301 --> 19:40.095
between our Supers
and an ordinary human being.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.473
Aside from things
like telekinesis and teleportation?

19:47.603 --> 19:48.437
Yes.

19:49.521 --> 19:50.480
Aside from that.

19:51.607 --> 19:55.194
The crucial difference
is a third strand of DNA,

19:56.486 --> 19:59.823
which we believe not only defines
the abilities gifted to the Supers,

19:59.907 --> 20:01.658
but which…

20:02.326 --> 20:04.369
And this is the really interesting part.

20:05.245 --> 20:07.539
We may just be able
to create a gene therapy

20:07.623 --> 20:11.084
to give exceptional powers to non-Supers.

20:17.341 --> 20:21.011
I hope the reason you are speechless
is because I just handed you

20:21.094 --> 20:24.598
the scientific growth area
and profit center of the next century.

20:26.391 --> 20:28.518
Custom tailored superpowers

20:29.102 --> 20:32.898
for any human being, agency,
or army with deep enough pockets.

20:34.149 --> 20:38.153
We stand on a threshold,
and on the other side is BIONA,

20:38.237 --> 20:42.741
a world leader that will dwarf
Google, Apple, and Amazon.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.286
All you have to do is fund a new team,

20:46.995 --> 20:47.955
my team,

20:48.038 --> 20:50.415
to immediately launch
into this new application.

20:54.836 --> 20:56.755
Do you have a head injury?

20:58.215 --> 21:01.510
-Excuse me?
-I asked if you had a head injury.

21:02.094 --> 21:05.722
Because only a person
with something seriously wrong with them

21:05.806 --> 21:08.308
could present this insanity
with a straight face.

21:10.060 --> 21:11.270
I mean…

21:11.353 --> 21:13.772
Look, we don't have this
completely worked out,

21:13.855 --> 21:15.023
but with proper funding--

21:15.107 --> 21:16.275
Proper funding?

21:16.358 --> 21:18.485
How about a half a billion dollars?

21:19.069 --> 21:22.614
Because that's how much money
BIONA, under Ben Cutler,

21:22.698 --> 21:25.200
poured into covering up
what happened in Iceland.

21:25.784 --> 21:28.704
Settlements, hush money,
medical treatments, relocation--

21:28.787 --> 21:31.790
Yes, and I-I-I realize
we've had a few setbacks--

21:31.873 --> 21:33.250
Setbacks?

21:33.333 --> 21:36.920
It's my understanding that we straight up
killed a man in a lab a few days ago.

21:37.004 --> 21:40.048
Now, maybe you don't
find that to be an issue,

21:40.132 --> 21:44.219
but to those of us who actually
care about the welfare of humanity,

21:44.303 --> 21:46.680
not to mention this organization,

21:47.180 --> 21:48.932
that's kind of a black mark.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.602
I was hoping you were offering us
a way past this reckless error.

21:52.686 --> 21:56.732
But instead, you come before this board
and ask us for even more money

21:56.815 --> 21:59.568
so that you can figure out
a way to do this to people.

22:00.485 --> 22:01.570
On purpose.

22:05.574 --> 22:06.992
You can thank us for our time later.

22:08.618 --> 22:10.037
Oh, and on a personal note,

22:10.120 --> 22:13.415
this might be a good time
for you to beef up your CV.

22:28.513 --> 22:30.724
I'm gonna
make billions of dollars.

22:31.683 --> 22:34.311
The most important
scientific discovery of all time.

23:06.593 --> 23:07.677
You're going the wrong way.

23:09.554 --> 23:12.307
-No, I'm not.
-Yeah, Dion's school is back that way.

23:12.391 --> 23:13.350
It's up by the, um…

23:19.439 --> 23:20.565
What's with the suitcases?

23:23.693 --> 23:24.736
Mom, where are we going?

23:25.237 --> 23:26.071
Home.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.697
To Chicago? Why?

23:28.198 --> 23:29.032
It's time.

23:29.783 --> 23:30.784
Did something happen?

23:33.245 --> 23:35.747
-Mom, I don't wanna go back.
-Decision's been made.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.375
I finally have a place
where people accept me,

23:38.458 --> 23:39.876
where I'm figuring out what…

23:40.585 --> 23:42.796
What I am, and who I am.

23:42.879 --> 23:44.464
And you just decide to pull me out

23:44.548 --> 23:46.842
and drag me back to Chicago
without even talking about it?

23:49.428 --> 23:51.847
-Ma, you can't do this.
-What is my job?

23:52.639 --> 23:54.516
Janelle, what is my job?

23:55.267 --> 23:57.853
-To keep me safe.
-And that is exactly what I'm doing.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.939
-Safe from what? My friends?
-You mean that boy?

24:01.690 --> 24:06.319
-Baby, there'll be other boys.
-What about Tevin and Dion and Nicole?

24:07.946 --> 24:08.780
Baby,

24:10.115 --> 24:10.949
Nicole's dying.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.411
No, she's not, I saved her.

24:16.830 --> 24:17.914
It wasn't enough.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.585
She's gonna die. She told me herself.

24:27.048 --> 24:27.883
I need to see her.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.468
-No.
-Yes!

24:30.844 --> 24:32.554
-Stop it.
-She believed in me.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.431
And Dion's gonna be all alone.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.099
-Mom, we have to go back.
-No.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.353
There's something hunting him, Janelle.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.189
Something that wants
to kill Powered people.

24:42.272 --> 24:45.317
And so we're running away
while he's in danger?

24:45.400 --> 24:46.401
You're Powered.

24:46.485 --> 24:50.280
That thing could come for you,
and my job is to keep you safe.

24:52.407 --> 24:54.701
-Stop it!
-I'm not safe in Chicago.

24:54.784 --> 24:56.912
I'm safe at BIONA,
with people who understand me.

24:56.995 --> 25:00.415
We are going home
and we're gonna put this behind us.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.250
You are not one of those people.

25:02.334 --> 25:04.419
You have no idea who I am
and you don't wanna know!

25:05.086 --> 25:07.172
You just want me to shut up,
put my head down

25:07.255 --> 25:08.673
and pretend to be somebody else.

25:08.757 --> 25:11.343
I want you to be okay. Okay?

25:11.426 --> 25:15.180
-I want things to be normal.
-I'll never be normal!

25:15.263 --> 25:16.181
Janelle!

25:17.599 --> 25:18.475
Janelle!

25:18.558 --> 25:20.101
-Janelle!

25:22.187 --> 25:24.523
Janelle! Janelle?

25:25.690 --> 25:26.775
Janelle, baby.

25:28.777 --> 25:30.904
Baby! Where are you? Come back!

25:35.242 --> 25:36.910
Okay, let's try on this one.

26:02.394 --> 26:03.937
Cut! Cut!

26:04.020 --> 26:07.691
You done singing? 'Cause I have a set
of sheet music here that says otherwise.

26:07.774 --> 26:11.987
-I'm sorry, Mr. Kwame, it's just today--
-Dion, this is our opening number.

26:12.070 --> 26:15.365
Your solo kicks off the show.
You cannot let the energy drop, you hear?

26:16.741 --> 26:18.118
You gotta give it this.

26:29.504 --> 26:32.173
Strong arms. Project to the back row.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.800
This is your moment to shine.

26:34.593 --> 26:35.844
I'm sorry, Mr. Kwame.

26:37.137 --> 26:38.346
I can't.

26:40.307 --> 26:41.725
You got people in that audience?

26:44.603 --> 26:46.313
-Who?
-My mom.

26:48.148 --> 26:48.982
Your mom.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.902
I've been on stage
many times with your mama.

26:53.820 --> 26:56.031
Sometimes she was up,
sometimes she was down,

26:56.114 --> 26:58.783
but she always gave her best.

27:00.535 --> 27:03.204
She never let her little personal drama
shut her down.

27:03.747 --> 27:08.084
She did it for them.
For her friends, for her family,

27:08.168 --> 27:11.338
for the people who came to the theater
that night to feel something.

27:12.422 --> 27:15.925
You know what she said to me when
she asked me to direct this extravaganza?

27:16.009 --> 27:18.970
She said, "Kwame,
I love musicals, you know that,

27:19.679 --> 27:21.348
and Dion is a natural performer."

27:23.058 --> 27:24.726
"I want to see him shine."

27:24.809 --> 27:28.772
"And I know you, Kwame, you will
get that boy to shine his brightest."

27:29.439 --> 27:30.357
And you know what?

27:31.316 --> 27:35.111
I'm not gonna let your mama down.
Are you gonna let your mama down?

27:36.279 --> 27:37.113
No.

27:37.739 --> 27:39.449
You gonna shine for your mama?

27:40.116 --> 27:40.950
Yes.

27:41.660 --> 27:42.535
Yes?

27:42.619 --> 27:45.038
Is that… "Yes."

27:45.789 --> 27:47.207
Or… "Yes!"?

27:48.541 --> 27:49.376
The last one.

27:50.543 --> 27:51.920
That's what I want to hear.

27:54.422 --> 27:57.592
-Thirty minutes till places. Come on.
-Thirty minutes, people!

27:57.676 --> 28:00.512
That means the house is open,
audience is coming in.

28:00.595 --> 28:02.514
Get ready to make magic!

28:04.683 --> 28:05.934
Don't let your mama down.

28:07.727 --> 28:10.480
Come on, let's get these costumes.
Let's move, move, move.

28:22.283 --> 28:23.118
Ms. Warren.

28:24.160 --> 28:24.994
Tevin.

28:26.329 --> 28:27.872
You do clean up good.

28:29.290 --> 28:31.626
Well, you know,
I really tried for my date tonight.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.211
Oh, you have a date. Where is she?

28:33.294 --> 28:35.505
Yeah, she's supposed to be…
You haven't seen her?

28:35.588 --> 28:36.631
-No.
-No?

28:36.715 --> 28:37.716
Mm-mm.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.388
Are those for me?

28:43.471 --> 28:44.889
Are you performing tonight?

28:44.973 --> 28:46.182
No, but

28:47.058 --> 28:49.102
Dion's not much of a red roses type.

28:49.185 --> 28:51.938
You know, you might be right.
You wanna hang on to 'em for me?

28:54.190 --> 28:55.900
Yeah, I can find a place for 'em.

29:04.159 --> 29:07.662
For the love of all things holy,
will you two kiss already?

29:07.746 --> 29:08.663
Hi, sis.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.081
How you doin'?

29:10.707 --> 29:11.583
Ask my date.

29:30.518 --> 29:31.394
I got this.

29:33.104 --> 29:33.938
I got this.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.149
-Ow!

29:36.232 --> 29:38.777
-Yo, Dion, are you okay?

29:38.860 --> 29:41.112
-Easy on the curtain!

29:41.196 --> 29:43.239
-We don't want the audience to see us.

29:49.370 --> 29:51.080
Can you hear that?

29:51.164 --> 29:54.125
Hear what?
Dion, we're like 15 minutes away!

29:54.209 --> 29:55.919
You're gonna take your spot, right?

29:56.002 --> 29:56.920
Yeah.

29:57.420 --> 30:00.381
-Do you want me to get Mr. Kwame?
-No! No!

30:00.465 --> 30:01.549
Where are you going?

30:08.848 --> 30:10.517
Is it time for another injection?

30:11.476 --> 30:13.770
I'm trying to hold out as long as I can.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.899
Is it the, uh… The last one?

30:21.986 --> 30:24.239
I'm just not ready
to start the countdown yet.

30:28.076 --> 30:30.870
I'm gonna hold out
for every last moment with Dion.

30:34.457 --> 30:35.583
Don't cry.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.210
Don't tell me what to do.

30:41.130 --> 30:44.801
I'm gonna give Dion
his opening night gift.

30:44.884 --> 30:46.886
You're gonna give him<i> that</i>
before the show?

30:46.970 --> 30:50.014
You know, go backstage,
give it to him, tell him to break legs.

30:50.098 --> 30:50.932
"Theater."

30:52.183 --> 30:54.102
-All right, come on.
-I got this.

30:54.894 --> 30:57.146
Okay, listen. Tell him
not to eat that before the show,

30:57.230 --> 30:59.023
or he's gonna be dancing on the ceiling.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.150
-Noted. I'll be right back.
-Okay.

31:07.490 --> 31:09.534
-What's up?
-Kat, I am sorry to bother you.

31:09.617 --> 31:12.120
I know you're with Nicole,
but we have a situation here.

31:12.203 --> 31:14.747
Pat injected himself
with the isolated strands of P-DNA.

31:14.831 --> 31:18.418
-What? Which ones?
-Every single strand.

31:18.501 --> 31:22.005
-Good Lord. Is he dead?
-Not yet, but doesn't look good.

31:22.088 --> 31:24.841
Wait, if he injected
all that separated DNA,

31:24.924 --> 31:26.718
how are you gonna work
on a cure for Nicole?

31:26.801 --> 31:29.262
-She's down to her last shot.
-<i>That's why I'm calling.</i>

31:29.345 --> 31:32.140
<i>If we have to start over,</i>
<i>collect new samples, try to separate them,</i>

31:32.223 --> 31:33.224
there's no time.

31:33.308 --> 31:34.392
So I need to know,

31:34.475 --> 31:37.437
is it medically possible to recover
any of that material from Pat?

31:37.520 --> 31:41.024
We could use metallurgic enzymes
to extract the metallic P-DNA.

31:41.107 --> 31:43.443
That would bring with it
the telekinetic strands.

31:43.526 --> 31:46.362
-Well, how fast can you get here?
-Ten minutes.

31:46.446 --> 31:49.574
But, Suzanne, listen,
if Pat dies, none of this works.

31:49.657 --> 31:50.617
Then you'd better hurry.

31:54.162 --> 31:56.247
I need you to give Nicole
a message for me.

31:58.374 --> 32:00.668
-<i>Dion.</i>

32:01.294 --> 32:03.379
<i>Did you miss me?</i>
-<i>Brayden?</i>

32:03.880 --> 32:06.382
<i>You didn't think</i>
<i>I'd be gone forever, did you?</i>

32:06.883 --> 32:10.887
<i>You think you and the nerd Avengers</i>
<i>would be enough to get rid of me?</i>

32:10.970 --> 32:12.263
<i>Where are you?</i>

32:15.725 --> 32:19.145
<i>I think you know</i>
<i>exactly where I am,</i>

32:19.228 --> 32:21.606
<i>and exactly what I'm going to do.</i>

32:21.689 --> 32:26.152
I'm not gonna let you hurt my friends.

32:26.235 --> 32:29.781
<i>The time for you</i>
<i>letting me do anything is over.</i>

32:30.573 --> 32:32.158
<i>I'm stronger than you.</i>

32:32.241 --> 32:33.701
<i>I'm better than you.</i>

32:33.785 --> 32:37.246
<i>And when I'm done,</i>
<i>there isn't going to be any you left.</i>

32:38.164 --> 32:41.000
<i>Just me with all your powers.</i>

32:41.084 --> 32:43.836
You want me? Fine, let's do this!

32:44.462 --> 32:46.047
<i>Meet me on the football field.</i>

32:46.130 --> 32:48.257
You mean the one
where I kicked The Crooked Man's butt?

32:49.842 --> 32:53.554
<i>This night</i>
<i>is going to end very differently.</i>

34:56.844 --> 34:59.347
