is to not say anything

the repercussions.

she gave to a kill shelter."

as propaganda

33:58.767 --> 34:01.133

34:01.166 --> 34:02.734
- 'Cause that's the use
of propaganda,

34:02.767 --> 34:05.767
is to drive a wedge
between groups,

34:06.000 --> 34:08.266

42:41.066 --> 42:42.300
to tell me I am a liar,
and I don't appreciate that.

42:42.333 --> 42:43.266
- I came here to tell you
that I have a hard time

42:43.300 --> 42:45.000
defending you

42:45.033 --> 42:46.166
when all of these people think
the exact same thing.

42:46.200 --> 42:47.367
- Okay. Okay.
And you know what?

42:47.400 --> 42:49.000
Please don't.
And you know what?

42:49.033 --> 42:50.266
If you turned around
and you said to me,

42:50.300 --> 42:51.734
"I'm telling you
on Farrah's life,

42:51.767 --> 42:53.166
"on Portia's life,
that is not the truth,

42:53.200 --> 42:55.000
and I know nothing
about that story,"

42:55.033 --> 42:57.333
you know what, sweetie?
I'd believe you. We're done.

42:58.333 --> 43:00.667
- Lisa's gone so far with this.

43:00.700 --> 43:03.066
She's in so deep
with what she said.

43:03.100 --> 43:04.333
There's no turning back.

43:04.367 --> 43:06.333
- Goodbye, Kyle!

43:06.367 --> 43:11.200
- So how are we ever going
to repair this situation?

43:11.233 --> 43:12.667
- Get the (BLEEP) out
of my house!

43:12.700 --> 43:14.633
I'm swear to you
I'm done with it.

43:14.667 --> 43:16.433
The lying bitches.
They can go (BLEEP) themselves,

43:16.467 --> 43:19.300
all of them,
but Kyle to say that to me?

43:19.333 --> 43:21.133
I'm done with her.
[sniffling]

43:25.200 --> 43:28.333
- Next time on "The Real
Housewives of Beverly Hills":

43:28.367 --> 43:29.700
- Oh!

43:29.734 --> 43:31.066
- Yes.
- Does this hurt our Botox?

43:31.100 --> 43:32.333
- Yeah.

43:32.367 --> 43:33.433
- We might want to rethink
the invention.

43:33.467 --> 43:35.367
- 318.
- That's bad.

43:35.400 --> 43:36.734
- 318.
- That's, like,

43:36.767 --> 43:38.667
close to diabetic coma.

43:38.700 --> 43:41.100
- I went to Lisa's house,
and she said,

43:41.133 --> 43:43.066
"You think that I did this
on purpose?

43:43.100 --> 43:46.066
Then there's nothing left
to say. Get out of our house."

43:46.100 --> 43:47.467
- Wow.
- That's not friendship.

43:47.500 --> 43:49.200
That's bullsh--.

43:49.233 --> 43:51.233
- I don't want to get
on her ----ing bad side.

43:51.266 --> 43:53.100
She plays ----ing dirty.

43:53.133 --> 43:56.767
- I can say I'm hurt,
but I'm not going to stand here

43:57.000 --> 44:00.266
and say
what a ----ing bitch she was.

44:00.300 --> 44:02.367
Ah, I said it.

44:02.400 --> 44:04.033
