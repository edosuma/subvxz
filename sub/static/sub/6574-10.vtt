17:54.815 --> 17:56.954
- But Blue!
- We can't help him if we drown...

17:57.117 --> 17:59.825
or are crushed
by the pressure at this depth.

18:33.187 --> 18:34.666
[GROWLS]

19:09.957 --> 19:11.163
It's me! It's me!

19:11.825 --> 19:13.065
Course it is.

19:13.227 --> 19:15.730
Mission accomplished, everyone.
Well done.

19:16.096 --> 19:18.440
Care to take the controls, Miss M?

19:18.599 --> 19:21.136
Think she's still basking
in the glow of victory.

19:21.301 --> 19:23.747
She totally nailed Aqualad.
You should have seen it.

19:23.904 --> 19:26.180
Well, actually, it didn't look like much.

19:26.340 --> 19:29.583
But I'm sure it was very cool
inside their heads.

19:35.682 --> 19:37.383
<i>By now they'll have moved
their ship.</i>

19:37.409 --> 19:39.665
<i>There's still the Beetle
connection to figure out.</i>

19:39.686 --> 19:41.666
<i>But you can tell the world they're here.</i>

19:41.822 --> 19:44.166
<i>Their secret invasion
is no secret anymore.</i>

19:44.324 --> 19:46.531
AQUAMAN:
That would be an understatement.

19:48.695 --> 19:50.003
[BEEPING]

19:50.864 --> 19:54.979
<i>CAT GRANT [ON SCREEN]: Repeating today's top
story: a small group of extra-terrestrials...</i>

19:55.002 --> 19:57.812
<i>the Reach, have arrived
at United Nations Headquarters...</i>

19:57.971 --> 19:59.171
<i>in New York City.</i>

19:59.206 --> 20:04.451
<i>For more on this, we go live
to GBS' own G. Gordon Godfrey at the U.N.</i>

20:04.778 --> 20:10.194
<i>Thanks, Cat. And, yes, folks,
it seems Earth's finally met some aliens...</i>

20:10.350 --> 20:13.422
<i>who know how to get it right.</i>

20:13.587 --> 20:16.466
<i>The Reach comes to your world
as friends.</i>

20:16.623 --> 20:20.264
<i>We come with open arms,
extending our hands...</i>

20:20.427 --> 20:23.601
<i>our reach, if you will, to help.</i>

20:25.466 --> 20:28.504
<i>Well, thumbs up to the Reach.</i>

20:28.669 --> 20:30.842
<i>Oh, I know what you're thinking.</i>

20:31.004 --> 20:35.043
<i>Old G. Gordon's gone soft
on the spacemen.</i>

20:35.209 --> 20:40.784
<i>But don't you see? This is exactly
how aliens should come to Earth.</i>

20:40.948 --> 20:43.019
<i>Knocking on our front door...</i>

20:43.183 --> 20:48.656
<i>not sneaking in the back,
like some Leaguers we know.</i>

20:50.491 --> 20:53.938
<i>So before we warn the public,
they go public.</i>

20:54.294 --> 20:55.494
It could be worse.

20:55.629 --> 20:58.337
At least we know exactly where they are.

20:58.699 --> 20:59.899
<i>That's right.</i>

21:00.167 --> 21:02.738
<i>We know what we're up against.</i>
