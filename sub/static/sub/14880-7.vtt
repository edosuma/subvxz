00:08.731 --> 00:12.367
Simon, it's me.
Can I see you?

00:12.434 --> 00:14.235
I'm on the short list, Joan,

of the Chinese ambassador post

01:03.690 --> 01:05.825
Oh, I have my finger
in a number of...

01:05.892 --> 01:09.161

Pies. Yeah, I know.

01:09.229 --> 01:11.564
What kind of pies,
specifically?

01:11.632 --> 01:13.232
Apple, rhubarb...

01:13.300 --> 01:15.568
cherry,

01:31.418 --> 01:33.085

01:33.153 --> 01:34.220
You have to work.

01:34.287 --> 01:36.355
I don't want to interfere.

01:36.423 --> 01:40.626
Well, I've never had a problem
mixing business and pleasure.

01:40.694 --> 01:43.262

01:43.330 --> 01:46.432
I do have some vacation time
saved up and...

01:46.500 --> 01:49.350
a bikini I've been dying
to wear.

01:49.861 --> 01:53.364
Or not wear.

01:53.432 --> 01:56.333
Where are you going--
Bahamas, Caymans?

01:56.401 --> 01:58.769
Cuba.

01:58.837 --> 02:02.139
Still interested?

02:05.177 --> 02:07.611
When do we leave?

02:12.784 --> 02:14.318
Hey. Thanks for seeing me
before work.

02:14.386 --> 02:16.153
My door is always open.

02:16.221 --> 02:20.524
It doesn't matter which door.
Come on in.

02:20.592 --> 02:24.095
So you want to go on vacation
with a seasoned FSB operative

02:24.162 --> 02:26.897
who very well
may be on to you.

02:26.965 --> 02:28.999
Or he may be letting his
emotions guide his decisions.

02:29.067 --> 02:31.735
And he's taking you to Cuba?

02:31.803 --> 02:33.003
I know the risks.

02:33.071 --> 02:34.605
If I got caught,

02:34.673 --> 02:36.774
the extraction
would be extremely high risk.

02:36.842 --> 02:38.709
Extraction?

02:38.777 --> 02:40.077
There would be no extraction.

02:40.145 --> 02:44.248
If you got caught, the Agency
would have no recourse.

02:44.316 --> 02:45.850
North Korea would be easier.

02:45.917 --> 02:49.120
Still,
the potential benefit is huge.

02:49.187 --> 02:52.022
Are you asking me to authorize
a mission to Cuba?

02:52.090 --> 02:55.459
'Cause if you are,
I can't give you that.

02:55.527 --> 02:58.696
But if you're telling me
you're gonna go anyway,

02:58.763 --> 03:02.199
I can't stop you.

03:02.267 --> 03:05.035
I can't use
my regular passport.

03:05.103 --> 03:07.338
The Agency
would be able to track me.

03:07.405 --> 03:09.039
So I need an outside forgery.

03:09.107 --> 03:10.174
I know a guy.

03:10.242 --> 03:11.775
Simon saw my passport
in Morocco,

03:11.843 --> 03:14.311
so the stamps
would have to match exactly.

03:14.379 --> 03:16.480
A replacement will find its
way to you before your flight.

03:16.548 --> 03:18.949
Now, Simon will probably fly you
through Mexico.

03:19.017 --> 03:21.318
It's the easiest way
to get Americans into Cuba.

03:21.386 --> 03:22.820
Once I land,
there will be eyes on me.

03:22.888 --> 03:24.722
Cuba has always been
a hotbed of Russian spies.

03:24.789 --> 03:26.857
They'd love to catch
an outside player.

03:26.925 --> 03:28.726
So don't get caught.

03:28.793 --> 03:30.794
Spycraft wouldn't be that much
fun without the bad guys,

03:30.862 --> 03:33.931
now, would it?

Hey, are you busy?
I'm stuck on something.

03:36.301 --> 03:37.968

your own blind joke.

a bottle over anyone's head,

assignment I don't know about?

04:01.393 --> 04:03.060
I'm taking
a few days vacation.

04:03.128 --> 04:04.395

who's never taken a day off work

04:07.499 --> 04:09.466

or Kwanzaa.

04:09.534 --> 04:11.869

the Annie Walker that I know.

04:20.411 --> 04:21.712

04:21.779 --> 04:24.315

you to come out?

for my flight.

We'll catch up when I get back.

a job like this in three hours.

Why the change of heart?

11:26.571 --> 11:28.606
Because it's clear
how much it means to you.

11:28.674 --> 11:30.441
What happens
if you actually get it,

11:30.509 --> 11:31.909
we'll have to deal with.

11:31.977 --> 11:36.314
Until then,
I am here to support you.

11:36.381 --> 11:38.883
But...
Oh, I knew there was a "but."

11:38.950 --> 11:40.751
You got to put on
a full-court press.

11:40.819 --> 11:42.520
You got to lobby,

11:42.587 --> 11:44.355
politick, schmooze.

11:44.423 --> 11:46.457
And a 45-minute sit-down
at the Hart Office building

11:46.525 --> 11:47.558
is not gonna cut it.

11:47.626 --> 11:48.626
What were you thinking?

11:48.694 --> 11:51.028
Dinner, our house,
with wives.

11:51.096 --> 11:53.297
- You hate hostessing.
- I know. I do.

11:53.365 --> 11:55.566
But I can put on a good show
if I need to.

12:11.783 --> 12:14.552
These are hands-down the best
croquetas I've ever had.

12:14.619 --> 12:16.854
This was my favorite part
of living on the move as a kid--

12:16.922 --> 12:19.056
all the new food.

12:19.124 --> 12:21.292
I'm sure it was a relief
to get away

12:21.360 --> 12:23.361
from the Moscow cuisine.
You got that right.

12:23.428 --> 12:25.596
At eight years old,
I'd had enough borscht

12:25.664 --> 12:26.831
to last a lifetime.

12:26.898 --> 12:28.032
You defected
when you were eight?

12:28.100 --> 12:30.134
- Mm-hmm.
- You must've been scared.

12:30.202 --> 12:31.635
My sister was even younger.

12:31.703 --> 12:33.637
We were terrified.

12:33.705 --> 12:35.206
My parents woke us up
in the dead of night,

12:35.273 --> 12:37.575
told us we were leaving
and never coming home.

12:37.642 --> 12:40.244
But they also told us
not to be frightened,

12:40.312 --> 12:42.012
because
they were bringing along

12:42.080 --> 12:45.182
this weathered old steamer trunk
that contained everything

12:45.250 --> 12:47.017
we needed to be protected
from danger.

12:47.085 --> 12:48.452
And what was in it?

12:48.520 --> 12:50.521
It didn't matter.

12:50.589 --> 12:52.823
We felt protected.

12:58.096 --> 12:59.363
You grew up in D.C.?

12:59.431 --> 13:01.966
Mm, I moved around a lot,
like you.

13:02.033 --> 13:04.101
I was a military brat.
Did you find that hard-

13:04.169 --> 13:06.604
adjusting to all the moves?
- At first.

13:06.671 --> 13:10.808
But my dad bought me
a little souvenir postcard

13:10.876 --> 13:12.343
every city we went to.

13:12.411 --> 13:15.146
That made me feel like home.

13:15.213 --> 13:16.580
I know it sounds silly--

13:16.648 --> 13:19.083
a postcard from the place
you just moved to,

13:19.151 --> 13:20.551
but from a guy like my dad,

13:20.619 --> 13:23.154
who had trouble
showing emotion...

13:23.221 --> 13:24.688
I knew it didn't come easily.

13:24.756 --> 13:29.026
Does he still send
you postcards?

13:29.094 --> 13:32.029
Not anymore.

13:36.635 --> 13:39.170
I seem to have lost track
of the time.

13:39.237 --> 13:40.337
I'm late for this meeting.

13:40.405 --> 13:41.772
What was that you said

13:41.840 --> 13:44.041
about balancing business
and pleasure?

13:44.109 --> 13:46.577
I'll be back
at the house in an hour.

13:46.645 --> 13:48.779
In the meantime,
try the plantains.

13:48.847 --> 13:51.415
They put the croquetas
to shame.

15:03.488 --> 15:05.222
What are you doing?
You here for pleasure?

15:05.290 --> 15:07.758
I had to come look for you.

15:07.826 --> 15:10.394
Come on, let's go.
Get in.

16:21.700 --> 16:23.267
Glad you called.

16:23.335 --> 16:25.502
I've had this line scrubbed
and back-checked,

16:25.570 --> 16:27.738
and I'm clear to talk on my end.
Can you speak freely?

16:27.806 --> 16:28.906
You can.

16:28.974 --> 16:31.342
Did you get eyes
on Simon's project?

16:31.409 --> 16:33.243
I did, but it was a little
hard to get cell reception

16:33.311 --> 16:36.347
12 miles outside of Havana.

16:36.414 --> 16:39.450
I know exactly
where you were.

16:39.517 --> 16:42.252
Get me the latest GSA images
of Lourdes, Cuba.

16:45.390 --> 16:48.125
Yep.
Used to be KGB's largest

16:48.193 --> 16:50.094
listening station
outside of Russia

16:50.161 --> 16:51.629
until they closed it in '01.

16:51.696 --> 16:54.898
From a bird's eye, it looks like
the facility is still dormant.

16:54.966 --> 16:57.635
I heard it loud and clear.

16:57.702 --> 17:00.170
Heard it?

17:00.238 --> 17:01.872
It's already operational?
Jesus.

17:01.940 --> 17:05.442
With the microchip substrates
that Simon took,

17:05.510 --> 17:08.779
they can turn Lourdes into
a cellular jamming station--

17:08.847 --> 17:11.415
disrupt cell signals,
FAA communications,

17:11.483 --> 17:13.983
military command and control.

17:14.051 --> 17:15.319
This is huge.

17:15.387 --> 17:18.122
And this is the kind of find
that makes careers.

17:18.189 --> 17:19.556
Now, you got to get
your ass back home

17:19.624 --> 17:20.958
so we can plan our next move.

17:21.026 --> 17:22.192
Easier said than done.

17:22.260 --> 17:24.528
There's a little problem
with our art project.

17:24.596 --> 17:26.997
It got locked away
for safekeeping,

17:27.065 --> 17:29.133
and I can't get
out of here without it.

17:29.200 --> 17:32.903
Even if you could somehow
sneak out without your passport,

17:32.971 --> 17:34.638
an escape like that would burn
you with Simon.

17:34.706 --> 17:36.507
It's just not worth it.

17:36.574 --> 17:38.509
My host has a new friend.

17:38.576 --> 17:40.878
Is he 6'0", 190 pounds,
with a scar on his right arm?

17:40.945 --> 17:42.513
That's him.

17:42.580 --> 17:45.849
Yeah, that's Hector Serrano,
FSB's top man in Cuba.

17:45.917 --> 17:48.152
Look, you know
I'm not risk-averse,

17:48.219 --> 17:51.221
but Serrano's not the kind
of guy you actively seek out.

17:51.289 --> 17:54.692
He's a former FSB hit man
with two dozen confirmed kills,

17:54.759 --> 17:56.226
including one of ours.

17:56.294 --> 17:58.462
As long as he's on the ground,
you are not safe.

18:13.645 --> 18:16.280
Simon?

18:16.347 --> 18:17.514
There you are.

18:17.582 --> 18:20.217
I came home,
and you weren't here.

18:20.285 --> 18:21.919
- I--
- Your foot.

18:21.986 --> 18:23.554
Are you hurt?

18:23.621 --> 18:24.855
Oh, no.

on the cobblestones,

18:26.558 --> 18:28.892

and--and not noticed.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.160
Well, I'm glad you're safe.

18:30.228 --> 18:32.496
You must be Annie!

18:32.564 --> 18:34.531
Uh, I am.

I forgot to tell you
we have dinner guests.

Blanca Gonzalez

Hector Serrano.

It's lovely
to finally meet you.

18:46.578 --> 18:47.511
Yes.

Really? How often
do you get to see him?

19:08.400 --> 19:09.934
Every few weeks.

19:10.002 --> 19:13.271
He's doing some business deal
with Hector.

19:13.339 --> 19:14.639
That must be frustrating--

19:14.707 --> 19:16.641
always losing your boyfriend
to a business meeting.

19:16.709 --> 19:18.343
Tell me about it.

19:18.410 --> 19:21.879
Hopefully I'll have him
back to myself soon.

He tells me this deal
is basically finished.

Three mojitos--

19:26.352 --> 19:27.919
the personal vice
of your countryman

19:27.986 --> 19:31.823
and fellow Cubaphile,
Ernest Hemingway.

19:34.126 --> 19:35.326
I wonder what

19:35.394 --> 19:38.062
Hemingway would think
if he saw our country

19:38.130 --> 19:39.997
after 50 years of the embargo?

19:40.065 --> 19:41.933
I bet he'd still be enchanted
with its natural beauty

19:42.000 --> 19:44.902
and free-spirited people.

19:44.970 --> 19:46.003
I know I am.

19:46.071 --> 19:47.405
Mm.

19:47.473 --> 19:50.475
We hear that sentiment
a lot from tourists.

19:50.542 --> 19:52.477
I find it
incredibly condescending.

19:52.544 --> 19:54.712
Hector, please.

19:54.780 --> 19:57.448
Annie is a guest
in our country.

20:02.020 --> 20:05.623
Americans tout our natural
beauty and demonize Castro,

20:05.691 --> 20:08.259
but it's the embargo
that is choking our economy.

20:08.327 --> 20:09.660
Well, I hope they repeal it.

20:09.728 --> 20:11.629
I'm sure the influx
of tourist dollars

20:11.697 --> 20:13.264
would be a boost
to the economy.

20:13.332 --> 20:15.767
Hmm.
Typical capitalist fantasy.

20:17.836 --> 20:19.937
Enough political debate,
Hector.

20:20.005 --> 20:21.038
Let's eat.

20:24.710 --> 20:27.578
Perfect timing--
the Gottfrieds are t-minus 30.

20:27.646 --> 20:28.746
This is your doing, mind you.

20:28.814 --> 20:30.848

my fault?

20:32.751 --> 20:34.786
the entire
foreign-policy establishment

20:34.853 --> 20:36.020
wants their pound of flesh.

20:36.088 --> 20:37.889
And one of them wants you
to join the cast

20:37.956 --> 20:39.323
of <i>Deadliest Catch?</i>

The assistant secretary of state

20:41.126 --> 20:42.393
for East Asian affairs

20:42.461 --> 20:44.028
is apparently
an avid fly fisherman.

Don't laugh. Come on, help me
take these tags off.

20:59.678 --> 21:01.145
If I knew
I was getting visitors,

21:01.213 --> 21:03.047
I'd have worn my good jumpsuit.

21:03.115 --> 21:04.382
Wouldn't make
any difference to me.

21:04.450 --> 21:08.085
You could be wearing
a prom dress for all I know.

21:11.123 --> 21:13.357
Well, I'll get to the point.

21:13.425 --> 21:16.093
I've read the transcripts,
and it is clear to me

21:16.161 --> 21:18.095
that you're holding
something back that could help

21:18.163 --> 21:19.797
with the investigation
into Jai's murder.

21:19.865 --> 21:21.499
What gives
you that impression?

21:21.567 --> 21:23.501
Call it a gut feeling.

If I knew something that would
help find my son's murderer,

21:26.939 --> 21:29.474
why in the world
would I hold that back?

21:29.541 --> 21:31.909
Maybe you're delusional enough
that you think that someday

21:31.977 --> 21:33.778
you're gonna get
out of here...

21:33.846 --> 21:36.781
and you can solve it yourself.

21:36.849 --> 21:38.983
Or maybe you're just enough
of an asshole

21:39.051 --> 21:41.552
to hold back out of spite.

21:41.620 --> 21:44.856
Just like
an Arthur Campbell disciple...

26:23.904 --> 26:25.437
What did you
and Blanca talk about?

26:25.505 --> 26:29.008
Honestly...

26:29.075 --> 26:31.177
you.

26:32.712 --> 26:36.048
She said she'd never seen
you so happy.

26:36.116 --> 26:38.117
She's right.

26:40.921 --> 26:44.690
I've never met
a woman like you...

26:44.758 --> 26:46.692
ever.

26:49.429 --> 26:52.364
And I don't think
I ever will again.

26:54.434 --> 26:56.502
I'm sorry.
Is that too forward?

26:56.570 --> 26:58.871
This is new territory for me.

26:58.939 --> 27:01.273
No, it's new for me too.
I, uh...

27:05.378 --> 27:08.547
Maybe this trip
and the juggling everything...

27:10.283 --> 27:13.052
Too much, too fast.

27:15.488 --> 27:18.857
I think you're right.

27:18.925 --> 27:21.727
Maybe we should go home
tomorrow.

27:23.797 --> 27:26.832
Yeah, I think--
I think that'd be best.

27:34.307 --> 27:42.581
♪

28:15.181 --> 28:17.149
So I'm the best man,
standing in front of...

28:17.217 --> 28:18.350
300 people?
Mmhmm.

28:18.418 --> 28:21.220
And I hear "beep, beep, beep."

28:21.288 --> 28:23.522
So I silence my pager.
It was a pager.

28:23.590 --> 28:24.957
90 seconds later,

28:25.025 --> 28:26.492
"beep, beep, beep, beep."

28:26.559 --> 28:27.826
You got to be panicking
at this point.

28:27.894 --> 28:29.161
Think about how
the guests feel.

28:29.229 --> 28:31.263
Everyone assumes
it's an international emergency.

28:31.331 --> 28:32.464
I know I have to take it,

28:32.532 --> 28:34.166
but it's in the middle
of the ceremony,

28:34.234 --> 28:36.201
so I go back down the aisle,
past the 300 people,

28:36.269 --> 28:37.469
and out the door.

28:37.537 --> 28:39.705
Everyone must think
China's invaded Russia.

28:39.773 --> 28:42.141
Everybody's thinking
China's invaded America.

28:43.643 --> 28:46.578
So Arthur's outside making
the call, and the priest--

28:46.646 --> 28:48.080
and I swear to God
this is true--

28:48.148 --> 28:50.015
Starts leading the church

28:50.083 --> 28:52.284
in a prayer
for our nation's safety.

28:52.352 --> 28:54.820
So what was the page?

28:54.888 --> 28:55.954
Low battery.

28:58.658 --> 29:01.427
You two are like
a comedy team.

29:01.494 --> 29:03.362
Yeah, we're thinking about
taking our show on the road.

29:03.430 --> 29:04.730
Well, from what I hear,

29:04.798 --> 29:08.067
you'll get to do that sooner
rather than later.

29:08.134 --> 29:10.169
Come on, we both know
you invited us here

29:10.236 --> 29:12.037
to talk
about the ambassadorship.

29:12.105 --> 29:15.274
- Guilty.
- No. It wasn't necessary.

29:15.342 --> 29:16.742
You're a shoo-in for the nom,

29:16.810 --> 29:18.477
and you're gonna sail through
the confirmation hearings.

29:18.545 --> 29:19.945
Are you sure?

29:20.013 --> 29:22.047
From what I hear, these things
are a bit of a trap game.

29:22.115 --> 29:23.882
No, no, the committee
loves the idea

29:23.950 --> 29:26.485
of having a heavyweight
in Beijing.

29:26.553 --> 29:30.055
And for you, the timing
couldn't be better.

29:30.123 --> 29:32.424
Well, everyone knows
that your trilateral commission

29:32.492 --> 29:34.593
hasn't come up
with any answers.

29:36.963 --> 29:38.630
Here's your parachute.

29:38.698 --> 29:41.233
Let your replacement
take the fall.

29:41.301 --> 29:43.969
You think that's why
I want the ambassadorship?

29:44.037 --> 29:47.172
Well, no, of course that's
not why you want the job.

29:47.240 --> 29:49.041
Call it a side benefit.

29:49.109 --> 29:50.809
So you think I'm gonna let
the next guy clean up my mess,

29:50.877 --> 29:53.579
while I'm 7,000 miles away
sipping scorpion bowls

29:53.646 --> 29:55.214
in Beijing.
Okay, relax.

29:55.281 --> 29:56.648
It was an innocent comment.

29:56.716 --> 29:59.651
From a career politician--
that's got to be a first.

29:59.719 --> 30:01.253
I don't know that
I have what it takes

30:01.321 --> 30:02.755
to join your ranks.

30:02.822 --> 30:04.590
I'm afraid I'll be bored
out of my mind

30:04.657 --> 30:07.559
if all I did all day long
was look out for my own ass.

30:07.627 --> 30:09.294
Jesus, I didn't mean
anything by it.

30:09.362 --> 30:12.931
- Why don't I get the dessert?
- I'm not hungry.

30:29.916 --> 30:33.986
I got this.
I got it.

31:02.315 --> 31:04.516
Change of plans--

31:04.584 --> 31:06.752
my jet doesn't arrive
at Jose Marti till noon.

31:06.820 --> 31:09.121
That gives us time to squeeze in
some sightseeing,

31:09.189 --> 31:12.157
one last bit
of Cuba before you go.

31:12.225 --> 31:14.726
Hector's gonna join us...

31:14.794 --> 31:17.563
so we'll take the convertible.

31:17.630 --> 31:19.031
Where's Blanca?

31:19.098 --> 31:20.766
She wasn't feeling well.

31:20.834 --> 31:23.001
I thought
I'd let her sleep in.

31:26.239 --> 31:28.340
Are you sure we have time?

31:31.044 --> 31:33.445
Don't look so worried.

31:33.513 --> 31:34.680
The beauty
of private aviation--

31:34.747 --> 31:38.217
you never have to miss
your flight.

32:24.667 --> 32:26.935
I don't think
they allow tourists.

32:27.003 --> 32:28.403
Exactly.

32:28.471 --> 32:31.673
This isn't one of those tourist
traps from the guide books.

32:37.680 --> 32:39.014
<i>Hola.</i>

32:52.328 --> 32:54.696
They don't allow talking
on the floor.

32:54.764 --> 32:56.765
You'll see why.

34:02.632 --> 34:07.102
The lector kept the workers
educated and entertained.

34:07.169 --> 34:10.272
Nowadays, most factories
outside Cuba use iPods,

34:10.339 --> 34:12.474
but these guys still use
the real thing.

34:12.542 --> 34:15.010
I want to show you
the storage room.

34:18.915 --> 34:21.516
It's been around
since the '20s.

34:25.254 --> 34:27.188
After you.

34:30.426 --> 34:33.194
- Go ahead.
- I insist.

34:48.277 --> 34:50.045
Simon!

34:50.112 --> 34:52.947
Simon?

35:15.638 --> 35:17.272
We have to go...

35:17.340 --> 35:19.407
now.

36:00.516 --> 36:02.283
Here we are again...

36:02.351 --> 36:04.319
another end.

36:06.956 --> 36:09.557
When will I see you again?

36:09.625 --> 36:11.159
I need to go home
for a few days,

36:11.227 --> 36:12.961
take care of some...

36:13.029 --> 36:14.562
loose ends.

36:14.630 --> 36:15.597
But soon.

36:15.665 --> 36:17.365
I got you a gift.

36:21.570 --> 36:23.004
It's nothing fancy,

36:23.072 --> 36:27.375
but it's a little more portable
than a steamer trunk.

36:29.912 --> 36:33.014
I love it.

36:37.653 --> 36:40.622
I finally did open that trunk

36:40.690 --> 36:42.691
when we got to London,
by the way.

36:42.758 --> 36:46.194
My imagination had built
the contents up so much, I--

36:46.262 --> 36:48.329
my curiosity
just got the better of me.

36:48.397 --> 36:50.899
And?

36:50.966 --> 36:52.067
What was inside?

36:53.836 --> 36:56.337
Clothes.

36:56.405 --> 36:58.073
Not guns, not knives...

36:58.140 --> 37:00.675
clothes.

37:00.743 --> 37:04.245
You were protected
by your parents' love.

37:06.749 --> 37:09.684
Love makes us
do remarkable things.

37:15.091 --> 37:18.159
Oh, wait.
I almost forgot.

37:18.227 --> 37:20.829
You'll need this.

37:50.266 --> 37:52.904
As you know,
working at the CIA

37:53.004 --> 37:57.174
gives me
certain privileges too.

37:57.242 --> 37:59.743
And they include summoning
a federal prisoner

37:59.811 --> 38:03.013
whenever I damn well please.

38:03.081 --> 38:05.983
Fair enough.

38:06.050 --> 38:09.519
Guard, hold all my calls.

38:10.755 --> 38:12.723
I'm here to tell you a story

38:12.790 --> 38:16.560
out the first time
I met Jai.

38:16.628 --> 38:19.162
Langley was buzzing.

38:19.230 --> 38:23.634
The son of a DCS
was coming off the farm.

38:23.701 --> 38:26.737
And everyone said
he was arrogant,

38:26.804 --> 38:29.406
entitled,

38:29.474 --> 38:31.708
selfabsorbed.
Just like dad.

38:31.776 --> 38:35.812
Exactly. But that wasn't
my impression of him.

38:35.880 --> 38:37.781
Maybe it's because I was blind

38:37.849 --> 38:40.484
and I couldn't see
the $1,000 John Lobbs

38:40.551 --> 38:42.919
or that hardened glare.

38:42.987 --> 38:47.591
What was
your impression, then?

38:47.659 --> 38:51.361
Jai had this unstoppable
thirst for knowledge...

38:52.930 --> 38:55.699
A yen for solving puzzles

38:55.767 --> 38:58.802
and understanding
the complexities of this world.

39:05.276 --> 39:08.378
He got that from his mother.

39:12.884 --> 39:15.986
If I did have something...

39:16.054 --> 39:18.488
what could you give
me in return?

39:18.556 --> 39:19.856
Nothing.

39:19.924 --> 39:22.492
You want to keep playing
these angles,

39:22.560 --> 39:26.229
Jai's murder
will remain unsolved.

39:26.297 --> 39:30.634
But for once, instead of son
trying to emulate father,

39:30.702 --> 39:33.670
maybe father
should try to emulate son.

39:40.878 --> 39:44.348
Chantilly Lofts,
Unit 317.

39:44.415 --> 39:45.515
What is that?

39:45.583 --> 39:50.120
The location
of Jai's safe house.

39:56.928 --> 40:00.197
So how long are we gonna wait
before we talk about last night?

40:00.264 --> 40:01.865
Oh, what's there
to talk about?

40:01.933 --> 40:03.333
I got a trash can full
of broken plates

40:03.401 --> 40:04.735
that might jog your memory.

40:04.802 --> 40:06.169
That might have been
a bit excessive.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.671
If you wanted off
the short list,

40:07.739 --> 40:09.306
you chose a hell
of a way to announce it.

40:09.374 --> 40:10.774
Well, maybe I don't want it
as much as I thought,

40:10.842 --> 40:12.743
not if it means selling
out the Agency.

40:12.810 --> 40:14.177
But it doesn't.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.480
Jai's murderer
is still out there.

40:16.547 --> 40:20.217
And the investigation
will continue without you.

40:20.284 --> 40:21.351
Arthur, at some point,

40:21.419 --> 40:23.253
you're going
to leave the Agency,

40:23.321 --> 40:27.391
and you're going to have
to leave something unfinished.

40:27.458 --> 40:29.426
- Not this.
- Why?

40:29.494 --> 40:30.761
I mean, why now?

40:30.828 --> 40:33.029
Why agree to be vetted,
get this far down the line,

40:33.097 --> 40:35.866
and then change your mind?

40:35.933 --> 40:38.301
I can't leave yet.

40:38.369 --> 40:39.369
Gottfried was right.

40:39.437 --> 40:40.737
To a military man,

40:40.805 --> 40:43.206
desertion is the single worst
accusation you can make.

40:43.274 --> 40:47.811
Since when do you care
about what some senator thinks?

40:47.879 --> 40:49.513
What's going on here?

40:49.580 --> 40:51.681
We better hit the road
if we're gonna miss

40:51.749 --> 40:54.718
the construction traffic on 66.

40:58.156 --> 41:00.524
And Serrano didn't
physically threaten Simon?

41:00.591 --> 41:03.660
It wasn't self-defense?
Not at all.

41:03.728 --> 41:06.430
So he killed his handler.

41:06.497 --> 41:09.232
That is the most transgressive
thing a spy can do,

41:09.300 --> 41:10.867
and he did it to protect you.

41:10.935 --> 41:14.004
That explains why he took
you on a mission,

41:14.071 --> 41:16.907
ignored the red flags.

41:16.974 --> 41:19.009
He's in love with you.

41:21.913 --> 41:23.814
The question is,
what do I do about it?

41:23.881 --> 41:25.515
You're already doing it.

41:25.583 --> 41:27.684
You're forcing Simon
to act irrationally.

41:27.752 --> 41:29.152
Now we can manipulate him.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.688
- Manipulate him to do what?
- Whatever we want...

41:31.756 --> 41:35.325
Whatever we need.

41:35.393 --> 41:38.528
What else did you think we were
doing here--playing house?

41:38.596 --> 41:39.996
This is what we set out to do.

41:40.064 --> 41:42.632
This is why we inserted you
with Simon in the first place--

41:42.700 --> 41:46.303
to build his trust.

41:46.370 --> 41:51.274
And there is no greater form
of trust than love.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.777
Annie, this is it.

41:53.845 --> 41:58.048
This is the brass ring.

41:58.115 --> 42:02.452
Now go home.
Get some rest, okay?
