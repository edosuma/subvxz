00:19.666 --> 00:20.708
How good of you to come.

00:21.291 --> 00:22.791
<i>Hola!</i> Nice to see you.

00:23.500 --> 00:24.958
How's the family?

00:25.041 --> 00:27.291
Thank you for coming.
Thank you.

00:27.375 --> 00:29.125
<i>Buenas noches!</i> Nice to see you.

00:30.791 --> 00:31.625
Good to see you.

00:35.000 --> 00:37.666
Man, boss,
what a great party.

00:39.375 --> 00:40.333
Jefe, no!

01:01.791 --> 01:03.583
Go back to your own country.

01:04.583 --> 01:09.291
Don't ignore me. Get out of here.
This is my country. Go back to Africa.

01:09.375 --> 01:10.833
Take it easy, kid!

01:10.916 --> 01:12.125
Shut up, asshole.

01:12.208 --> 01:13.666
What did you just say?

01:13.750 --> 01:14.833
Watch out.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.916
Hey, Dad. It's me.

02:49.458 --> 02:52.333
Just calling to let you know
that Mom and I landed safely.

02:52.416 --> 02:56.708
Just on the way to the hotel now.
Call me when you get a minute. Love you.

02:57.500 --> 02:58.500
That was nice.

02:58.583 --> 02:59.541
Mm-hmm.

02:59.625 --> 03:01.000
Sure he'll appreciate that.

03:01.625 --> 03:02.583
Yeah.

03:06.208 --> 03:07.416
Spring in Madrid.

03:08.083 --> 03:10.041
Oh, my God, honey. Look at this.

03:25.083 --> 03:26.416
Come on, baby. We're here.

03:26.500 --> 03:28.458
Mom, cut it with the baby stuff. Okay?

03:29.375 --> 03:31.791
It's just a term
of endearment, Becca.

03:31.875 --> 03:34.833
Well, it's beyond embarrassing.
So are you right now.

03:35.541 --> 03:36.375
Fine.

03:36.458 --> 03:38.250
Let's go. Don't forget your things.

03:38.333 --> 03:42.416
Rebecca Mary Leah Franklin, we're here.
Get the hell out of the car now.

03:43.583 --> 03:45.041
-Better?
-You're a monster.

03:45.166 --> 03:47.541
Okay. Make sure. You got your IDs?

03:48.791 --> 03:50.333
Don't laugh at me. It's not funny.

03:50.416 --> 03:53.625
It's fine.
You know your mom is overprotective.

03:53.708 --> 03:55.791
-This is just a phase, right?

03:55.875 --> 03:59.750
It better be. I'm about ready to strangle
one of these moody little bitches.

03:59.833 --> 04:02.250
Check this. It's us. Figure skating team.

04:02.875 --> 04:04.833
-Did you sleep at all on the plane?
-I tried.

04:04.916 --> 04:07.833
-Those children will not stop talking.
-Little voices in my ear.

04:07.916 --> 04:11.833
-Um… Uh…

04:11.916 --> 04:13.958
<i>-Español…</i>
<i>-Tu es…</i>

04:14.041 --> 04:16.125
<i>Un poquito español, poquito.</i>

04:16.208 --> 04:17.625
Here we are.

04:21.666 --> 04:22.875
-Whoa.
-Wow.

04:22.958 --> 04:24.250
We've got two rooms?

04:24.333 --> 04:27.791
I had my points
and they told me they upgraded.

04:27.875 --> 04:29.250
How about that, huh?

05:07.791 --> 05:13.166
I'm sorry about earlier. I'm tired
and shouldn't have been so short.

05:15.250 --> 05:18.875
I'm about to get my period, so I'm not
exactly sunshine and rainbows either.

05:21.833 --> 05:22.791
That all?

05:24.666 --> 05:27.875
I think I'm just still getting used
to the idea that you're here.

05:31.291 --> 05:34.500
I thought you were cool with me
covering for Claire's mom.

05:34.583 --> 05:39.000
I am. I mean, it's just different
than I imagined. That's all.

05:43.083 --> 05:44.166
You want some Motrin?

05:44.708 --> 05:46.291
I'm gonna hit the bathroom first.

05:53.625 --> 05:54.666
Feel better.

06:15.500 --> 06:16.541
Shit!

06:17.375 --> 06:18.541
Becca, what's wrong?

06:18.625 --> 06:20.708
I forgot freaking tampons. You bring any?

06:22.291 --> 06:25.541
No. Between putting the dog in the kennel,

06:25.625 --> 06:29.250
and the gardener and everything else,
it seems I forgot a whole bunch of stuff.

06:30.583 --> 06:34.416
But I saw a store just around the corner.
I'll be right back.

06:48.291 --> 06:52.708
No! Someone help me. Please.
What is happening?

06:52.791 --> 06:56.666
Someone, please help.
Please. Someone help me.

07:14.958 --> 07:16.041
The key has turned.

07:16.833 --> 07:17.666
Where am I?

07:18.291 --> 07:20.916
Where's my daughter?
What is going on here?

07:22.208 --> 07:23.583
Who the fuck are you people?

07:23.666 --> 07:26.083
I'm an American.
You can't take me off the street.

07:26.166 --> 07:29.958
Technically, you shouldn't be able
to take anyone off the street.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.375
Regardless of their nationality.

07:33.916 --> 07:34.916
Here we are.

07:37.916 --> 07:38.958
Come sit.

07:40.666 --> 07:41.750
Who the hell are you?

07:41.833 --> 07:46.166
The, uh, black suits
and Tom Cruise sunglasses

07:46.250 --> 07:48.125
sort of give it away, don't you think?

07:56.000 --> 07:57.083
You're the CIA?

07:57.625 --> 08:01.083
Sorry about the doodling.
It, um, helps me focus.

08:02.125 --> 08:04.625
Been doing it since I was a kid.
It used to get me in trouble,

08:04.708 --> 08:07.958
but it is now proven
to help with cognitive thinking.

08:08.625 --> 08:11.500
What the hell does the CIA want with me?

08:11.583 --> 08:15.583
The city in the '90s,
New York City, was quite the spot.

08:15.666 --> 08:22.250
Tons of artists, musicians, dignitaries,
and a whole bevy of foreign assets.

08:22.833 --> 08:28.500
There was one asset in particular.
Female, young, and she was…

08:30.333 --> 08:31.791
truly special.

08:32.916 --> 08:34.666
An artist in her trade.

08:34.750 --> 08:38.041
Five confirmed kills. All powerful people

08:38.125 --> 08:40.375
-with even more powerful enemies.

08:41.291 --> 08:44.166
They called her "The Whisper."

08:45.541 --> 08:48.875
Because she was never fully seen
or heard or even photographed.

08:48.958 --> 08:51.666
And it was always somebody else
left holding the bag.

08:52.875 --> 08:56.291
We were able to collect these bits
and pieces of her through various sources,

08:56.375 --> 09:00.333
but before we could put it all together,
the bottom fell out of Russia's economy.

09:00.916 --> 09:05.291
Its intelligence services nearly collapsed
and like that, The Whisper was gone.

09:07.000 --> 09:11.708
Some said she joined the Mossad.
Others, a revolution in Bolivia.

09:11.791 --> 09:14.500
But you wanna know what I think happened?

09:16.000 --> 09:19.041
Once Russia wasn't watching anymore,
The Whisper…

09:19.875 --> 09:22.583
Well, she saw a chance
to have her freedom.

09:24.291 --> 09:30.750
So she got a new identity,
fell in love, got married and had a kid.

09:31.333 --> 09:35.166
And she stopped worrying
that she'd ever be found.

09:36.833 --> 09:37.791
Isn't that right?

09:39.375 --> 09:44.541
Anya Petrova, aka The Whisper.

09:48.458 --> 09:52.208
It's 12 euros for that.
That size? I mean, not… Look.

09:52.291 --> 09:56.416
My mom's gonna see this bill, so you need
to work out a way so it doesn't show up.

09:56.500 --> 09:58.333
-Well, I'm not paying for it.

10:01.791 --> 10:03.541
Jesus, B. You scared us.

10:03.625 --> 10:07.208
Sorry. I didn't realize
everyone else would be here too.

10:07.291 --> 10:10.125
Well, why wouldn't we be here?
We're all sharing a room.

10:11.791 --> 10:13.000
So what's up, Becca?

10:13.500 --> 10:16.083
Um, by any chance, you got any tampons?

10:16.166 --> 10:18.125
Uh… Yeah, I think so.

10:18.208 --> 10:21.208
Good. Because I forgot mine
and then my mom went to get me some

10:21.291 --> 10:24.750
and now she's apparently lost
and not answering her phone.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.458
If I don't answer my phone, I'm dead.

10:26.541 --> 10:28.500
-Is she still talking?

10:28.583 --> 10:32.958
What are you waiting for? Just take them
and we'll fill them back up with water.

10:33.041 --> 10:38.000
But it has sensors on it. So as soon as
you lift a bottle it charges the room.

10:38.083 --> 10:40.041
Oh, great. So, we're basically fucked.

10:40.125 --> 10:42.333
Or you could find some straws.

10:45.375 --> 10:47.958
That's not a bad idea.
Straws, straws, straws.

10:48.041 --> 10:49.208
A-ha!

10:52.500 --> 10:54.833
You think
that I'm a Russian spy?

10:58.041 --> 11:03.666
I'm gonna give you one chance to come
clean and do this the simple way, Anya.

11:04.375 --> 11:08.708
My name is Jenny Franklin.
I'm from Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

11:08.791 --> 11:13.166
The last fight I had was with Susie Heyser
in eighth grade and she kicked my ass.

11:13.750 --> 11:16.083
I'm telling you.
You got the wrong lady, buddy.

11:18.000 --> 11:18.833
Fine.

11:21.416 --> 11:22.500
We'll do it your way.

11:24.416 --> 11:25.458
Kill her.

11:27.375 --> 11:31.250
Kill me? No. No, no, no.

11:31.333 --> 11:34.333
I'm not who he says I am.
I'm a single mom.

11:34.416 --> 11:36.375
I can't even get elected to the PTA.

11:36.458 --> 11:37.916
Please, you have to listen to me.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.375
-Please--

13:26.916 --> 13:28.208
Welcome back, Anya.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.083


13:42.416 --> 13:45.875


13:51.333 --> 13:52.583
You have a light?

15:00.333 --> 15:02.250
Excuse me, Woo Lao-Tzu?

15:03.458 --> 15:04.625
Why do you want to know?

15:04.708 --> 15:09.208
Because I'm supposed to meet Lao-Tzu
here to score some Levi's. You him?

15:09.291 --> 15:12.791
No, but I'm willing to bet
he's not as good-looking as I am.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.958
-I'm Su-Yin.

15:20.208 --> 15:21.333
Anya.

15:23.666 --> 15:27.875
You going to ask what her
astrology sign is next, dweeb?

15:27.958 --> 15:29.833
You've got your game. I've got mine.

15:29.916 --> 15:32.583
And that's why you never get laid.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.416
You know what? You're a mean drunk.

15:34.500 --> 15:36.583
She doesn't even like boys.

15:36.666 --> 15:38.833
You wanna bet?

15:38.916 --> 15:41.083
So I can take more of your daddy's money?

15:42.166 --> 15:46.375
I'm a Leo.
With Virgo rising.

15:46.458 --> 15:48.500
But my Chinese sign is Monkey.

15:50.833 --> 15:52.416
And I like boys.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.041
And girls.

16:00.666 --> 16:02.750
But I'm done talking.

16:05.958 --> 16:07.208
Let's dance.

16:41.166 --> 16:42.458
Mom.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.500
-Mom? Mom?

16:49.791 --> 16:50.958
Are you okay?

16:52.333 --> 16:55.000
Yeah. Think so.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.708
Where'd you go? I thought the store
was right around the corner.

16:58.375 --> 16:59.625
Um…

16:59.708 --> 17:03.625
The store was closed.
So I went looking for another and…

17:05.000 --> 17:06.166
got lost.

17:06.250 --> 17:09.916
Okay. Like you say,
text me next time so I know you're okay.

17:10.583 --> 17:14.041
'Course. Sorry. How long have I been out?

17:14.875 --> 17:15.958
No idea.

17:16.041 --> 17:19.958
I was in Maddie's room hanging and when
I got back you were totally passed out.

17:20.625 --> 17:21.833
Got it.

17:24.000 --> 17:25.000
Where are you going?

17:25.625 --> 17:29.541
Oh. Heading out with Maddie and the team
to get some dinner. See a show.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.958
Good. So the girls invited you?

17:32.041 --> 17:33.958
Pretty sure Maddie forced them,
but who cares?

17:34.041 --> 17:35.208
Let's be positive.

17:35.958 --> 17:36.791
Better?

17:36.875 --> 17:39.041
-I just want you to be--
-Normal?

17:40.375 --> 17:41.541
Happy.

17:41.625 --> 17:43.250
Stop worrying. I'm fine.

17:44.625 --> 17:45.541
Love you.

17:47.291 --> 17:48.583
Love you too.

18:09.250 --> 18:10.875
<i>It's gonna be so fun.</i>

18:11.666 --> 18:14.458
I've heard great things
about this restaurant as well.

18:14.541 --> 18:16.250
Gonna be amazing.

18:18.791 --> 18:20.083
And we're in Spain!

18:20.583 --> 18:22.291
Okay, do we have everybody?

18:22.375 --> 18:24.875
Oh, damn it. I forgot my phone.

18:24.958 --> 18:27.625
Are you kidding? Come on,
we're gonna be late for our reservation.

18:27.708 --> 18:31.083
Then go. Becca will roll with me
and we'll catch up later.

18:31.166 --> 18:33.666
And don't wait for us
to get the party started.

18:33.750 --> 18:36.166
Remember, the drinking age is 18, bitches!

18:36.958 --> 18:39.000
Okay, come on. This is gonna be so fun.

18:40.166 --> 18:43.375
Oh, my God.
I can't wait to get out of these clothes.

18:44.500 --> 18:45.875
Got the practice rink's address?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.875
Yeah.
We can actually walk from here.

18:47.958 --> 18:48.875
Nice.

19:13.416 --> 19:14.416
Feeling better?

19:15.375 --> 19:16.625
Not so much now.

19:17.125 --> 19:18.750
This doesn't have to be hard.

19:19.500 --> 19:21.125
Says the guy who kidnapped me.

19:21.208 --> 19:23.208
Seemed like the best way
to not make a scene.

19:24.708 --> 19:25.666
What do you want?

19:26.416 --> 19:29.208
You. To do what you do best.

19:31.291 --> 19:32.750
I'm no longer that person.

19:34.375 --> 19:39.041
Well, I suggest you find her,
because you're about to get busy.

19:41.375 --> 19:42.666
And if I refuse?

19:42.750 --> 19:46.916
Then, based on Title 18,
Chapter 37 of the Espionage Act,

19:47.000 --> 19:50.333
you'll be spending the rest of your life
in a maximum security prison.

19:50.416 --> 19:53.166
Without an address or any running water.

19:53.708 --> 19:55.708
Your daughter
is gonna carry all the burden

19:55.791 --> 19:58.208
that her mother being
a secret Russian spy bears.

19:58.791 --> 20:02.625
Starting with all those college admission
offices pulling her acceptance letters.

20:07.875 --> 20:08.958
I do not like you.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.041
Yeah. I get that a lot.

20:15.125 --> 20:16.333
Follow me.

20:26.583 --> 20:28.083
Across the hall? Seriously?

20:28.166 --> 20:32.000
It's time I introduced myself.
I'm Special Unit Agent Chauncey Lew

20:32.083 --> 20:34.541
and this is my technical support
Christopher Clarke.

20:34.625 --> 20:38.333
Chris. Clarke. It's a pleasure, Miss Anya.

20:39.666 --> 20:40.791
-It's Jenny.

20:40.875 --> 20:44.041
Okay, Jenny. Tight-ass grip.

20:44.583 --> 20:46.458
Chris, let's, uh, walk her through this.

20:46.541 --> 20:48.958
All right. Uh, please turn your attention
to the monitors.

20:49.416 --> 20:50.958
Forty-eight hours ago,

20:51.041 --> 20:55.375
these three seemingly normal
Spanish citizens were all compromised.

20:55.458 --> 20:58.250
Their reputations and lives ruined by

20:58.333 --> 21:01.583
exhibiting behaviors
outrageously uncharacteristic.

21:01.666 --> 21:05.583
And which ultimately left one of
them dead, one beaten into a coma,

21:06.208 --> 21:07.916
and another in a padded room.

21:08.000 --> 21:11.708
Mass hysteria.
Collective delusions.

21:11.791 --> 21:16.041
Or what we see here suggests
your espionage work

21:16.666 --> 21:17.750
as The Whisper.

21:17.833 --> 21:21.625
How you could assume or manipulate
someone's identity like a, uh,

21:21.708 --> 21:24.666
master of disguise. Or maybe it was drugs.

21:24.750 --> 21:26.375
A girl has her secrets.

21:26.458 --> 21:27.625
I bet she does.

21:27.708 --> 21:31.708
However you managed it,
then you would destroy their reputation,

21:31.791 --> 21:36.416
leaving them no other option
but to be killed or to kill themselves.

21:36.500 --> 21:39.416
I was in the United States
48 hours ago, so there's--

21:39.500 --> 21:41.041
We know this wasn't you.

21:41.125 --> 21:45.666
But if there is somebody out there
copying your old Whisper MO

21:45.750 --> 21:48.125
of seek, meet and delete,
wouldn't you be interested?

21:48.208 --> 21:49.208
Not really.

21:49.291 --> 21:53.041
Well, lucky for you, the CIA wants to know
who that somebody is.

21:53.125 --> 21:55.666
And why they're choosing to do it.

21:55.750 --> 21:59.958
I can tell you our only solid lead
right now is all three so-called victims

22:00.041 --> 22:05.041
have a connection to an Austrian gunrunner
we've identified as Yannick Mair.

22:05.125 --> 22:09.250
Unfortunately, Mr. Mair
is hard to interrogate at the moment

22:09.333 --> 22:11.791
because he's being held
at a Spanish military hospital.

22:12.375 --> 22:14.500
But, 'cause I'm lit,

22:15.041 --> 22:17.708
I was able to find the weak link
in that hospital security.

22:17.791 --> 22:20.791
A maintenance manager named Tiago Vento.

22:20.875 --> 22:24.791
Tiago likes to get his swerve on
at this biker bar called El Pirata Loco

22:24.875 --> 22:26.916
nearly every night
before his graveyard shift.

22:27.000 --> 22:31.958
So it's time to slip on some high heels
and say hi to Tiago.

22:33.208 --> 22:37.916
Wait. You're bringing me out of retirement
for a honey trap?

22:38.500 --> 22:40.750
Sure. It's not your first.

22:40.833 --> 22:43.666
It's my first with cracked nipples
and a C-section scar.

22:43.750 --> 22:45.416
You're giving men too much credit.

22:45.500 --> 22:47.458
I'm not talking about men.

22:48.375 --> 22:51.000
I'm talking about me.
I'm not 20 years old anymore.

22:51.083 --> 22:55.125
I've had a kid.
I've been a mother, a wife.

22:55.208 --> 22:58.250
I know it might seem like a lie to you,
but it is my life.

22:58.333 --> 22:59.625
I have a feeling you'll manage.

22:59.708 --> 23:02.916
If you're so confident about it,
why don't you spread your ass cheeks

23:03.000 --> 23:05.375
and take one up
the old gloryhole for Uncle Sam.

23:05.458 --> 23:08.458
Because I didn't get caught.
Which is what you're really angry about.

23:09.291 --> 23:13.375
You got cocky,
stopped covering your tracks. I found you.

23:13.458 --> 23:17.375
And now you want me
to cut a guy's fucking eye out

23:17.458 --> 23:20.625
so you guys can get to
this Yannick-fucking-whatever.

23:20.708 --> 23:22.833
Sorry if I'm not all kumbaya about it.

23:22.916 --> 23:25.833
Actually, no.
We're not cuttin' no eyes out.

23:25.916 --> 23:28.500
I'm gonna give you this device.
Hooks onto a cell phone.

23:28.583 --> 23:32.166
It will clamp onto Tiago's eye,
which pretty much will replicate it.

23:34.875 --> 23:36.375
I don't know if I can do this.

23:51.166 --> 23:52.208
Hey.

23:54.916 --> 23:58.125
I don't give a shit what you need to do
to get back on that bike.

23:59.208 --> 24:03.666
Just get back on it. And get to work
before I lock your ass up.

24:06.833 --> 24:07.875
Anya?

24:08.583 --> 24:09.875
Anya's dead.

24:10.500 --> 24:11.750
You better hope not.

24:15.708 --> 24:16.958
Can you believe it?

24:17.041 --> 24:20.750
I mean, we started talking about
this competition in what, eighth grade?

24:20.833 --> 24:25.166
Probably. Because I just got my braces off
and had to wear that derpy retainer.

24:25.250 --> 24:26.083
It wasn't that bad.

24:26.166 --> 24:27.583
Tell that to Brad Abrams.

24:28.083 --> 24:31.000
Oh, my God. That's right.
You gave Brad a second circumcision.

24:31.083 --> 24:34.208
That's what he gets for pushing
my head down like that.

24:34.291 --> 24:35.750
Still can't believe you blew him.

24:35.833 --> 24:38.875
Had nothing to do with Brad.
I was just checking it off the list.

24:39.583 --> 24:41.541
Will we get in trouble
for being here?

24:41.625 --> 24:42.541
Probably.

24:42.625 --> 24:44.291
Then what are we doing?

24:45.583 --> 24:47.875
Getting a feeling
for the ice here

24:47.958 --> 24:50.458
while the pussy posse parties it up.

24:51.833 --> 24:54.791
I'll take any kind
of competitive edge I can get.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.708
You've only got one person to beat.

25:01.791 --> 25:04.041
Claire. I know.

25:07.791 --> 25:09.208
At least you stand a chance.

25:09.750 --> 25:11.916
Look, I know
you're a last-minute replacement

25:12.000 --> 25:16.458
because someone got injured,
but you're here now. Take your shot.

25:16.541 --> 25:17.583
Yes, Mom.

25:20.083 --> 25:23.958
Speaking of, how's that going?
Still clueless about the divorce?

25:24.041 --> 25:25.291
Radio silence.

25:26.166 --> 25:28.916
I bet your dad,
with all his travelling, screwed around.

25:29.000 --> 25:31.166
Knowing my mom, she did nothing about it.

25:31.708 --> 25:37.166
I actually wish she'd take some risks
in her life. Be more… adventurous.

25:45.916 --> 25:49.541
Oh, shit. Think, Jenny.

25:52.791 --> 25:54.166
Think, Jenny.

25:55.500 --> 25:56.333
Think.

25:57.958 --> 25:58.791
Fuck.

26:08.375 --> 26:09.208
Fuck!

26:23.416 --> 26:25.583
I can't fucking do this!

26:26.458 --> 26:27.875
Oh, come on, Jenny.

26:29.708 --> 26:32.250
You can do this. Come on.

26:33.958 --> 26:34.791
Oh, fuck it.

27:58.916 --> 28:00.125
There you are.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.083
What about Su-Yin?

28:05.625 --> 28:06.833
He'll find us.

28:07.583 --> 28:08.416
How?

28:09.291 --> 28:10.958
We live together in the Chinese Embassy.

28:11.041 --> 28:12.625
Must be nice.

28:13.500 --> 28:17.791
Yeah. Su-Yin's dad
is the Ambassador from China.

28:17.875 --> 28:20.041
So they got money.

28:20.125 --> 28:22.416
But my dad's a paper pusher.

28:25.333 --> 28:27.333
What do you want to do in your life?

28:28.041 --> 28:30.750
No idea. But I'm not staying here.

28:31.291 --> 28:34.333
Most of my family's life
has been about just scraping by.

28:34.916 --> 28:36.208
-Seriously?
-Mmm.

28:36.291 --> 28:38.708
So, why's a Russian "paper pusher"
and his daughter

28:38.791 --> 28:40.208
living in the Chinese Embassy?

28:40.291 --> 28:42.708
Boring story.

28:42.791 --> 28:44.791
Let's go, the train's coming.

28:46.875 --> 28:48.583
Wait, you have something there.

28:49.416 --> 28:50.625
Maybe a hair.

28:52.791 --> 28:53.708
Did you get it?

28:54.208 --> 28:56.041
-Yes.
-Thank you.

28:59.458 --> 29:00.666
Can I hold your hand?

29:27.500 --> 29:29.166
Where did you learn Mandarin?

29:30.208 --> 29:34.250
Uh… I grew up above Fu's Laundry.

29:34.333 --> 29:37.000
Mrs. Fu took me under her wing.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.666
She put me to work, um…

29:43.500 --> 29:45.833
Washing, drying,

29:46.666 --> 29:49.458
ironing and folding.

29:49.541 --> 29:51.583
That sounds horrible.

29:52.250 --> 29:53.708
It wasn't so bad.

29:55.625 --> 29:57.458
She cooked for me.

29:57.541 --> 30:02.333
So, all the wontons I could eat.

30:02.958 --> 30:04.916
You telling me that's the way
to your heart?

30:05.458 --> 30:06.541
Wontons?

30:06.625 --> 30:10.458
Throw in some shrimp with
lobster sauce and I'm all yours.

30:10.541 --> 30:11.708
Mmm.

30:13.791 --> 30:15.291
Why do I not believe you?

30:17.166 --> 30:18.083
What do you mean?

30:19.583 --> 30:21.125
Nothing is that easy.

30:24.125 --> 30:26.541
Or maybe some things
aren't as hard as you think.

30:34.791 --> 30:38.958
Look at the little pussies holding hands.

30:39.041 --> 30:43.000
You think we're like America
now with all their homos?

30:43.666 --> 30:45.875
What's wrong? Jealous?

30:46.416 --> 30:49.208
Jealous of what? A couple of lickers?

30:49.291 --> 30:51.000
Don't provoke them, Faina.

30:51.541 --> 30:53.041
Of course not.

30:53.125 --> 30:58.000
Uh, so, which one of you holds the mirror
while the other two suck each other off?

30:58.083 --> 31:00.416
Shut your mouth, perverts!

31:04.208 --> 31:06.083
You know what you two need?

31:06.666 --> 31:08.750
Some real dick.

31:09.916 --> 31:13.000
I don't know, Anya.

31:13.083 --> 31:15.375
Maybe they're right.

31:15.916 --> 31:17.541
What?

31:18.125 --> 31:20.958
Maybe some good dick
will turn us straight.

31:21.041 --> 31:23.458
So whip them out, boys. Let's have a look.

31:24.458 --> 31:25.291
Seriously?

31:25.375 --> 31:28.916
Yes. I've never seen one before.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.875
But I'm sure once I do

31:31.958 --> 31:34.666
I won't be able
to keep my hands off of it.

31:35.666 --> 31:38.958
If you're too shy…

31:40.291 --> 31:43.750
we can find other guys
with dicks to show us.

31:43.833 --> 31:44.666
No.

31:45.541 --> 31:47.125
Ease up. We got it.

31:49.750 --> 31:52.416
Mm-hmm. Wow.

32:03.708 --> 32:05.375
Come on, let's go!

32:14.750 --> 32:16.750
Hey.
I think you're lost, baby.

32:16.833 --> 32:18.666
'Cause you should be sitting on my face.

32:19.666 --> 32:20.958
<i>Makin' friends I see.</i>

32:21.041 --> 32:25.750
And here I thought seeing you was bad.
Hearing you is even worse.

32:25.833 --> 32:28.500
I'm not gonna lie,
you're growing quickly on me.

32:28.583 --> 32:32.791
Hopefully, like a fungus that spreads
down your throat and chokes you to death.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.833
Always get like this when
you're on a fuck-and-pluck?

32:35.916 --> 32:37.583
You always such a douche?

32:37.666 --> 32:39.916
Wow. Okay, you two, let's focus.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.416
<i>You're a few meters away from the bar,</i>
<i>Jenny. I need you in full Whisper mode.</i>

32:46.125 --> 32:49.041
<i>Okay. Let's get eyes on the mark</i>
<i>and confirm he's there.</i>

32:49.666 --> 32:50.875
Copy that.

32:51.916 --> 32:53.750
<i>Remember,</i>
<i>you have the eye scanner.</i>

32:53.833 --> 32:57.541
<i>When the target is in a nice, safe place,</i>
<i>put the device up to his left eye</i>

32:57.625 --> 32:58.791
<i>and I'll handle the rest.</i>

33:00.208 --> 33:02.916
Tiago Vento's bike. He's here.

33:05.125 --> 33:07.125
<i>Showtime. You know what to do.</i>

33:09.041 --> 33:11.416
I'm not ready for that.
Change of plans.

33:16.125 --> 33:19.208
Tiago, come quickly.
Tiago, it's your motorbike.

33:19.291 --> 33:20.625
What?

33:24.291 --> 33:27.416
-You see who did this?
-My Spanish sucks.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.208
Uh, two guys did it. Laughed.

33:29.291 --> 33:31.291
Went up the staircase in the parking lot.

33:31.375 --> 33:32.958
Son of a bitch!

33:33.041 --> 33:34.208
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

33:35.625 --> 33:37.541
-Asshole!

33:45.666 --> 33:48.833
All right, Chris.
The device is in position. Do your thing.

33:48.916 --> 33:49.916
<i>Yes, Ma'am.</i>

33:50.458 --> 33:52.666
Manners? Someone raised you right.

33:52.750 --> 33:55.083
That'd be my momma.
I owe everything to her.

33:55.166 --> 33:56.625
A man who loves his momma.

33:57.750 --> 34:00.750
Love is part of it. The rest is pure fear.

34:01.875 --> 34:04.833
Okay. Our eye-scan is complete.

34:06.291 --> 34:07.750
<i>You can roll on home, Jenny.</i>

34:09.083 --> 34:10.083
That was easy.

34:10.166 --> 34:11.458
<i>Good work.</i>

34:16.458 --> 34:17.750


34:17.833 --> 34:19.791


34:19.875 --> 34:21.875
That was pretty cool.

34:21.958 --> 34:24.458
No one's going to mess
with you while I'm around.

34:33.833 --> 34:34.833
What's wrong?

34:37.666 --> 34:44.333
I don't want to be the prize for some
bet you have with Su-Yin.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.333
It's not like that.

34:48.666 --> 34:49.750
I like you.

34:50.416 --> 34:51.916
You don't even know me, Faina.

34:53.125 --> 34:55.583
Then let's change that.

34:57.958 --> 35:02.333
Meet me tomorrow night.
Same time. Same place.

35:02.416 --> 35:04.708
-We can hold hands more.

35:22.875 --> 35:27.708
Where were you?
Don't you know I worry?

35:27.791 --> 35:29.583
Not now, Papa.

35:49.500 --> 35:50.500
How's that feel?

35:50.583 --> 35:53.500
Like someone is sticking
a hot poker into my eye.

35:53.583 --> 35:55.041
Good. That means it's working.

35:55.625 --> 35:56.666
Okay. Listen up.

35:57.541 --> 35:59.708
Here's a map of the military hospital.

35:59.791 --> 36:03.250
You're going to start out down below.
Ingress is via the maintenance entrance,

36:03.333 --> 36:05.166
compliments of Tiago's eye-scan.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.458
You'll work your way along
these corridors here

36:07.541 --> 36:11.875
until you reach this utility door.
Which leads to the main access point.

36:12.625 --> 36:14.125
How do I get through that door?

36:14.208 --> 36:15.500
I'll handle that.

36:16.000 --> 36:18.541
So, uh, why do I need to do this again?

36:18.625 --> 36:19.750
Versus who?

36:19.833 --> 36:20.708
What about Chris?

36:20.791 --> 36:23.375
-Oh, no. I'm not CIA.
-What are you talking about?

36:23.458 --> 36:24.541
I'm a computer architect.

36:24.625 --> 36:25.666
You're a hacker.

36:25.750 --> 36:28.583
Goddamn. Why you always
gotta put salt in my game, man?

36:30.000 --> 36:33.125
I was black-hatting a cybersecurity system
to phish for pin numbers

36:33.208 --> 36:36.541
when I got knocked by the Company.
It was either do hard time…

36:37.375 --> 36:39.375
or become crackerjack here's IT guy.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.000
That explains the watch, then.

36:41.541 --> 36:43.750
There's no way you got that
on a CIA salary.

36:44.541 --> 36:45.791
It's my lucky watch.

36:45.875 --> 36:50.875
Look. You're the only one with the skills
necessary to get inside that hospital,

36:50.958 --> 36:54.458
find Yannick Mair and extract what
he knows about his three associates

36:54.541 --> 36:56.958
and why they were taken out
the way they were.

36:57.041 --> 36:59.708
What do you mean, find him?
Don't you know where he is?

37:00.500 --> 37:01.583
Not exactly.

37:03.375 --> 37:04.208
Great.

37:04.291 --> 37:05.625
But don't sweat it.

37:05.708 --> 37:08.041
I'll show you
the hospital's mainframe computer.

37:08.125 --> 37:11.708
And how you can access it so you
can find out where the hell Yannick is.

37:13.166 --> 37:14.416
What's wrong?

37:14.500 --> 37:17.375
My daughter will be back in an hour.
She'll freak if I'm not there.

37:17.458 --> 37:18.791
You will be.

37:18.875 --> 37:21.500
This will take less than an hour.
In and out. Promise.

37:21.583 --> 37:23.958
All right. Let's get this over with.

37:24.541 --> 37:25.750
One last thing.

37:30.833 --> 37:32.291
Yes indeed.

37:45.375 --> 37:46.750
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

37:47.625 --> 37:48.583
CIA certified.

37:51.250 --> 37:54.208
For whom? <i>Sports Illustrated</i> models?

37:54.291 --> 37:55.875
Your point?

37:56.750 --> 37:58.375
I bet anything a man designed this.

37:58.458 --> 38:01.125
Jenny, just forget the design
for a second, okay?

38:01.208 --> 38:04.458
This suit has state-of-the-art technology
built into it, okay?

38:04.541 --> 38:07.041
Weaponry… I mean,
this shit is made of Kevlar.

38:07.125 --> 38:10.500
This is our best chance of getting
you back to Becca in one piece.

38:47.333 --> 38:49.208
You stupid cow.

38:49.291 --> 38:52.750
Didn't you recognize the girl
whose hand you were holding? Hmm?

38:52.833 --> 38:56.375
It was in the file you were given
and supposed to read. But you didn't.

38:56.458 --> 38:58.041
I did.

38:58.125 --> 38:59.333
Then who is she?

39:00.125 --> 39:02.208
The daughter of Artur Orlov,
the biophysicist

39:02.291 --> 39:06.041
who is trying to ferret the secret
Yaroslav Program out of Mother Russia.

39:07.041 --> 39:09.041
Then why did you not kidnap her?

39:10.833 --> 39:14.208
There is no reason to scare her
or her father. Because I think--

39:15.166 --> 39:17.541
You don't think. You act.

39:29.666 --> 39:30.916
<i>How you doin', Jenny?</i>

39:31.000 --> 39:34.833
Scared shitless. Sore.
I don't know if I can do this.

39:34.916 --> 39:36.625
<i>Look, it's all muscle memory.</i>

39:36.708 --> 39:39.875
Tell that to my muscles.
God, this suit is so tight.

39:39.958 --> 39:44.625
Look on the bright side. It's helping us
monitor you, so I got you the whole way.

39:45.166 --> 39:47.583
<i>You sure</i>
<i>this is a military hospital?</i>

39:48.291 --> 39:50.041
It looks like an industrial park.

39:50.583 --> 39:54.250
<i>The best place to hide is in plain sight.</i>
<i>But you know that better than anyone.</i>

39:54.333 --> 39:58.500
Yes, I do. Thank you.
You're like an asshole Jiminy Cricket.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.125
That was easy.

40:17.791 --> 40:19.791
<i>What I tell you? I got you.</i>

40:20.458 --> 40:24.458
<i>Keep moving so we can get you home before</i>
<i>your daughter realizes you're missing.</i>

40:25.291 --> 40:27.791
<i>That's the smartest thing</i>
<i>you've said so far.</i>

40:30.708 --> 40:32.833
Thanks for inviting me
to work out.

40:33.500 --> 40:34.916
Maddie? You good?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Sorry. I'm just thinking
about the competition

40:37.083 --> 40:39.166
and that boring-ass outfit I have to wear.

40:39.250 --> 40:40.875
At least the skirt's cute.

40:40.958 --> 40:46.541
That's so fucked up. I need an edge.
Something to make me stand out on the ice.

40:49.541 --> 40:52.291
Let's try in here.
Maybe I'll find some inspiration.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.416
Ooh…

41:02.500 --> 41:06.500
And it's my size, too…
This is a straight freakum dress.

41:06.583 --> 41:08.958
-You'd totally kill in that dress.
-I know, right?

41:09.041 --> 41:11.208
Okay, what about this one for me?

41:11.875 --> 41:16.125
Yeah. That's a Dolce & Gabbana.
But your mother would kill you.

41:16.791 --> 41:18.791
Yeah, you're right. She totally would.

41:18.875 --> 41:22.708
Okay. You're about six yards
from that utility door.

41:22.791 --> 41:25.291
<i>It'll be on your right</i>
<i>next to what looks like a grill pit.</i>

41:30.000 --> 41:31.250
I'm here. What now?

41:31.333 --> 41:33.250
<i>Wait for the distraction.</i>

41:33.333 --> 41:34.416
What distraction?

41:36.166 --> 41:38.458
-That distraction. Move.

41:49.125 --> 41:51.625
-What the hell? I got a proximity alert.

41:51.708 --> 41:54.416
Jenny, I'm reading hostiles
right in front of you.

41:56.541 --> 41:58.500
Chauncey, you're so dead.

42:02.208 --> 42:04.458
Let's have some fun!

42:04.541 --> 42:06.666
<i>You've got</i>
<i>a dozen hostiles chasing you.</i>

42:06.750 --> 42:08.666
I noticed. Which way?

42:08.750 --> 42:09.625
<i>Go left.</i>

42:11.750 --> 42:15.583
They're right behind her.
Make a right through that door.

42:19.250 --> 42:23.375
<i>There should be a door that leads</i>
<i>to a locker room. Right. Yes.</i>

42:25.125 --> 42:26.916
She's here.

42:34.916 --> 42:36.333
Open the door, slut.

42:37.416 --> 42:39.750
She might have
bought herself some time.

42:39.833 --> 42:41.833
But she don't have a lot of options.

42:41.916 --> 42:42.791
We'll see.

42:54.666 --> 42:55.875
Shit.

43:01.416 --> 43:02.666
Mom?

43:13.250 --> 43:14.916
<i>Jenny, do you read me?</i>

43:15.000 --> 43:17.333
<i>It looks like the hostiles</i>
<i>made it past your barricade.</i>

43:18.416 --> 43:22.291
I don't have this area mapped, but I can
still get telemetry data from her suit.

43:26.000 --> 43:26.916
Mom?

43:28.625 --> 43:29.500
Fuck!

43:33.166 --> 43:36.208
"Mom, are you okay? Where are you?"

43:38.250 --> 43:40.416
<i>Jenny, that's a dead end.</i>
<i>Get out of there.</i>

43:53.625 --> 43:55.250
I cannot believe I have to do this.

43:56.166 --> 43:57.291
<i>Chauncey, you asshole.</i>

43:57.916 --> 43:59.958
Do what? What's she talking about?

44:00.041 --> 44:02.500
-Hold up. Her vitals are spiking. Jenny.

44:03.250 --> 44:05.208
Wait, I just lost all her biometrics.

44:11.833 --> 44:12.875
Mom?

44:43.208 --> 44:47.333
What the fuck is going on?
