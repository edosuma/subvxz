00:04.070 --> 00:05.070
<i>[Lucas] Throughout my life,</i>

00:05.072 --> 00:08.941
<i>my emotions have been
a very big struggle.</i>

00:16.082 --> 00:16.948
<i>[woman crying] Somewhere in me</i>

00:16.950 --> 00:19.785
<i>is this little glimmer of hope.</i>

00:19.787 --> 00:22.054
<i>I just wanna be a normal person.</i>

00:22.389 --> 00:24.256
[grunts and sighs]

00:32.832 --> 00:35.801
<i>[man] You can't do it,
and then I just get mad.</i>

00:35.803 --> 00:38.070
<i>[woman 2] If I don't
make a change now,</i>

00:38.072 --> 00:39.371
<i>I'm scared it's gonna be
too late.</i>

00:43.777 --> 00:45.044
[straining] No!

00:45.046 --> 00:46.645
You're making me hurt!

00:46.647 --> 00:49.148
<i>[woman 3] I refuse
to stop fighting.</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:51.250
<i>I have to do this
for my children.</i>

00:57.424 --> 01:00.225
One, two... hang on.

01:01.528 --> 01:03.228
Are you okay?

01:43.303 --> 01:46.105
<i>[Lucas] I dread waking up
in this body every morning</i>

01:50.777 --> 01:53.145
<i>because these days, it's
just too difficult for me to face.</i>

01:55.615 --> 01:56.815
<i>My body hurts</i>

01:56.817 --> 01:57.983
<i>and the stuff I have
to go through</i>

01:57.985 --> 01:59.785
<i>just to have a normal day</i>

01:59.787 --> 02:01.987
<i>is painful on every level.</i>

02:03.857 --> 02:05.424
<i>And so I live in despair.</i>

02:09.729 --> 02:11.063
<i>At the size that I'm at now,</i>

02:11.065 --> 02:12.631
<i>I could still get around,</i>

02:12.633 --> 02:14.166
<i>but it's difficult.</i>

02:15.768 --> 02:17.936
<i>I feel pain in all parts
of my body</i>

02:18.404 --> 02:20.339
<i>and I'm exhausted all the time.</i>

02:25.445 --> 02:27.946
<i>My parents built
an outdoor shower for me</i>

02:27.948 --> 02:30.015
<i>but I can't get the water
to go all over my body</i>

02:30.017 --> 02:31.550
<i>'cause I'm too big,</i>

02:31.552 --> 02:33.318
<i>so that doesn't work for me.</i>

02:34.721 --> 02:37.422
<i>And the only shower I could
fit in is at my sister's place,</i>

02:38.658 --> 02:40.425
<i>so I have to go there
to get cleaned.</i>

02:43.029 --> 02:46.665
<i>I'm too big for chairs,
hallways, doors,</i>

02:46.667 --> 02:49.701
<i>bathrooms, toilets, my bed...</i>

02:49.703 --> 02:52.337
<i>I'm too big for bathtubs.</i>

02:53.640 --> 02:57.042
<i>My family has a compound
here in Conroe, Texas</i>

02:58.678 --> 03:00.779
Basically, they're just little
buildings that we've purchased

03:00.781 --> 03:04.149
and then everybody has
their own little personal space.

03:04.684 --> 03:07.819
<i>So, I sleep in the building
next to my sister's.</i>

03:07.821 --> 03:10.522
<i>And then my parents live
in the bigger unit.</i>

03:10.524 --> 03:14.293
<i>But my life has become just
one challenge after another.</i>

03:19.699 --> 03:21.934
<i>By the time I get
to my sister's front steps,</i>

03:21.936 --> 03:24.136
<i>my breathing has gotten
pretty bad,</i>

03:24.771 --> 03:26.371
<i>my muscles are burning.</i>

03:26.839 --> 03:28.874
<i>I feel like I'm moving
a whole pile</i>

03:28.876 --> 03:30.742
<i>at the line of scrimmage
in football,</i>

03:30.744 --> 03:33.078
<i>but it's just the fat
on my body.</i>

03:37.083 --> 03:39.051
<i>And that's not even
the main event yet.</i>

03:39.053 --> 03:40.819
<i>Getting a shower,</i>

03:40.821 --> 03:42.387
<i>that's a workout by itself.</i>

03:46.726 --> 03:49.361
<i>I'm thankful I can still
clean myself.</i>

03:49.363 --> 03:52.564
<i>I could picture a time
where I can no longer do that</i>

03:52.566 --> 03:54.233
<i>and it's a pretty scary thought.</i>

03:56.603 --> 03:58.337
<i>Every part of my body is heavy,</i>

03:58.871 --> 04:01.139
<i>so lifting my arms
to clean myself</i>

04:01.141 --> 04:04.509
<i>is just as hard
as lifting my legs to walk.</i>

04:04.511 --> 04:06.211
<i>And the pain
from the weight of my belly</i>

04:06.213 --> 04:08.180
<i>pulling down
on my legs and back,</i>

04:08.448 --> 04:09.881
<i>it's a lot.</i>

04:09.883 --> 04:12.351
<i>I get anxiety about
slipping over and falling.</i>

04:13.920 --> 04:15.254
<i>By the time I get done,</i>

04:15.256 --> 04:17.356
<i>I still have to dry off
and get dressed.</i>

04:18.591 --> 04:22.060
<i>I do it sitting down 'cause
there's no way I could stand for it.</i>

04:22.695 --> 04:25.364
<i>And the exertion from that
can be difficult.</i>

04:26.833 --> 04:29.234
<i>I'm going to start
swearing again,</i>

04:30.470 --> 04:33.305
<i>but I sweat pretty much
all the time anyway.</i>

04:35.575 --> 04:40.112
<i>Once I'm dressed, then it's time to
move on to something much happier,</i>

04:40.114 --> 04:42.914
<i>something that brightens
my day every day of my life.</i>

04:42.949 --> 04:44.950
<i>Food.</i>

04:48.588 --> 04:50.789
<i>Food is the highlight of my day.</i>

04:50.791 --> 04:53.592
<i>It always gives me something
to look forward to.</i>

04:53.594 --> 04:55.827
<i>And while I'm cooking,
I make a lot of it</i>

04:55.829 --> 04:58.997
<i>because I have to feed
my sister's kids,</i>

04:58.999 --> 05:00.432
<i>but also because
the more food there is,</i>

05:00.434 --> 05:03.669
<i>the longer I can stay in
that place food takes me to.</i>

05:03.671 --> 05:07.839
<i>Food is my happy place,
and kind of always has been.</i>

05:07.841 --> 05:10.275
<i>It's been there for me
ever since I was a little kid.</i>

05:14.881 --> 05:17.582
<i>I was born at Conroe Regional.</i>

05:17.584 --> 05:19.518
<i>I don't remember exactly
tales about my weight,</i>

05:19.520 --> 05:20.952
<i>my height or anything like that,</i>

05:20.954 --> 05:24.022
<i>I just do know my mom says
I was a difficult baby.</i>

05:25.558 --> 05:26.858
<i>The way my mother describes it</i>

05:26.860 --> 05:28.860
<i>was everything
was stressful for me.</i>

05:28.862 --> 05:30.929
<i>And I think the reason was</i>

05:30.931 --> 05:32.397
<i>because the household,
growing up,</i>

05:32.399 --> 05:33.665
<i>was very chaotic.</i>

05:33.667 --> 05:36.435
<i>I have six brothers and sisters,</i>

05:36.437 --> 05:40.739
<i>but I'm the only one with the
combination of parents that I have,</i>

05:40.741 --> 05:44.142
<i>so all my siblings are either
half- or step-siblings.</i>

05:48.147 --> 05:52.084
<i>Most of the time, our parents
were unhappy parents.</i>

05:52.086 --> 05:54.586
<i>They broke up and got
back together a few times,</i>

05:54.588 --> 05:56.154
<i>so it never felt stable.</i>

05:56.156 --> 05:58.357
<i>They separated after I was born,</i>

05:58.359 --> 06:01.960
<i>that's when she met
my sisters' father</i>

06:01.962 --> 06:04.730
and she conceived my two
little sisters, who are twins,

06:04.732 --> 06:06.231
Jessica and Maegen.

06:06.599 --> 06:08.967
<i>So, the twins have
a separate dad.</i>

06:08.969 --> 06:11.903
<i>Even though they refer to my
dad as their dad a lot of the time,</i>

06:11.905 --> 06:13.705
<i>he's actually their step-dad.</i>

06:13.707 --> 06:16.808
<i>In fact, I remember
being up there, the hospital,</i>

06:16.810 --> 06:18.777
<i>and I remember
seeing my dad there,</i>

06:18.779 --> 06:20.912
<i>at the window,
he was waving at us</i>

06:20.914 --> 06:23.782
<i>and he was showing
the girls off.</i>

06:23.784 --> 06:25.016
<i>But their dad wasn't there.</i>

06:25.018 --> 06:26.418
<i>And I was just, like,</i>

06:26.819 --> 06:28.787
<i>"I don't know how to handle
this. I don't know what to say."</i>

06:28.789 --> 06:29.755
<i>So that was weird.</i>

06:29.757 --> 06:31.923
<i>But after that,
when the girls came home,</i>

06:31.925 --> 06:33.892
<i>I had a tough time
with them at first.</i>

06:33.894 --> 06:35.594
I guess I was just
jealous of them,

06:35.596 --> 06:38.597
just that they got
more attention than I did.

06:38.599 --> 06:41.400
<i>So what I did when I
felt that way is to go eat.</i>

06:41.402 --> 06:43.568
<i>And when I was eating
something good,</i>

06:43.570 --> 06:45.771
<i>I could just focus
on how good it tasted,</i>

06:45.773 --> 06:47.906
<i>and that's how I got myself
to feel better.</i>

06:47.908 --> 06:49.941
I don't think my parents
watched what I ate.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.043
I don't recall
if they ever cared

06:52.045 --> 06:53.712
about how much I weighed
when I was a kid,

06:53.714 --> 06:54.913
because I was neglected.

06:54.915 --> 06:56.848
<i>I didn't understand at first.</i>

06:56.850 --> 06:57.849
<i>I was questioning myself,
you know,</i>

06:57.851 --> 06:59.651
<i>"Do my parents love me?</i>

06:59.653 --> 07:02.454
<i>Do they care?
Am I doing something wrong?"</i>

07:02.456 --> 07:05.957
<i>I don't know if that contributed
to how everything feels.</i>

07:05.959 --> 07:08.560
I just know I didn't want to be around
my parents when I was a young kid

07:08.562 --> 07:12.030
because I just, I don't know,
it was just stressful.

07:13.766 --> 07:15.934
<i>[Sheryl] Through all the struggles
that he's had through his life,</i>

07:15.936 --> 07:18.403
<i>I guess it started
when he was four.</i>

07:18.405 --> 07:21.373
<i>He had two sisters all at once.</i>

07:22.275 --> 07:26.011
And he was the object
of our attention

07:26.013 --> 07:28.680
until twins came along,
newborns.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.883
<i>And now he wasn't getting hardly
any attention that he was used to,</i>

07:31.885 --> 07:34.653
<i>and he had to learn
to deal with that.</i>

07:34.655 --> 07:36.588
My life was stressful,
family was stressful,

07:36.590 --> 07:37.889
<i>school was pretty stressful.</i>

07:37.891 --> 07:40.492
<i>Elementary school, I was
made fun of for being big.</i>

07:40.494 --> 07:43.028
<i>My teachers didn't like me.</i>

07:43.030 --> 07:47.732
<i>I think it was mostly because, I
think growing up, I was just very hyper,</i>

07:47.734 --> 07:49.835
I always had
a hard time focusing.

07:49.837 --> 07:52.971
<i>Whenever I felt neglect
from my mom and dad,</i>

07:52.973 --> 07:55.407
<i>or I had teachers
that just didn't like me,</i>

07:55.409 --> 07:56.908
<i>and if I was sad or scared,</i>

07:56.910 --> 07:59.144
<i>I always ran to eat food.</i>

07:59.146 --> 08:00.979
<i>Food made me feel full,</i>

08:00.981 --> 08:02.414
<i>it made me feel satisfied,</i>

08:02.416 --> 08:03.882
<i>and it made me feel happy,</i>

08:03.884 --> 08:07.419
<i>like I didn't need
to be sad anymore.</i>

08:07.421 --> 08:09.087
<i>And yes, it made me gain weight.</i>

08:09.089 --> 08:12.257
<i>When I was 10 years old,
I weighed 160 pounds.</i>

08:12.825 --> 08:14.559
Now, he didn't over-eat,

08:14.561 --> 08:16.628
but he would have seconds.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.964
<i>And that was when
we started noticing</i>

08:18.966 --> 08:22.000
<i>that he was a very hyper child.</i>

08:23.002 --> 08:24.636
<i>Basically, he was hyper.</i>

08:24.638 --> 08:26.872
<i>We had to put locks
at the tops of the doors</i>

08:26.874 --> 08:30.008
<i>because he would sneak out
at the age of three</i>

08:30.610 --> 08:32.777
and I would find him
on a busy highway

08:32.779 --> 08:34.980
with people going
90 miles an hour.

08:36.015 --> 08:36.581
Three years of age.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.116
Terrified me.

08:38.918 --> 08:41.052
<i>[Lucas] Fourth grade,
fifth grade and sixth grade</i>

08:41.054 --> 08:42.687
<i>was at the private school.</i>

08:42.689 --> 08:44.256
<i>I felt out of place.</i>

08:44.258 --> 08:47.392
<i>I felt like, you know,
maybe I didn't belong.</i>

08:48.794 --> 08:51.396
<i>I did look to food for comfort.</i>

08:51.398 --> 08:55.767
<i>And so, I do recall going
from age 10 to age 12, 13,</i>

08:55.769 --> 08:58.403
<i>I did gain about 100 pounds,
close to it.</i>

08:58.405 --> 09:00.805
So going onto junior high,

09:00.807 --> 09:02.841
I weighed about 250 pounds,

09:02.843 --> 09:05.143
and it was just
increasing over time.

09:05.678 --> 09:08.013
<i>I think I was 11
or 12 years old,</i>

09:08.015 --> 09:09.748
<i>and my mom and dad
got back together,</i>

09:09.750 --> 09:10.982
<i>they did get married.</i>

09:10.984 --> 09:13.585
<i>And then, I think the next year,</i>

09:13.587 --> 09:15.120
<i>eighth grade, they divorced.</i>

09:15.122 --> 09:17.255
<i>That was really,
really difficult on me.</i>

09:18.891 --> 09:19.925
<i>After the divorce,</i>

09:19.927 --> 09:21.393
<i>I wanted to hate somebody</i>

09:21.395 --> 09:22.861
<i>and I wanted to love someone.</i>

09:22.863 --> 09:25.063
<i>I didn't know who to choose.</i>

09:25.065 --> 09:26.431
<i>I did turn to food
to ease the stress.</i>

09:28.668 --> 09:30.135
[Maegen]
<i>Me and my brother Lucas,</i>

09:30.202 --> 09:33.638
<i>when I was younger, we didn't
really have much of a relationship.</i>

09:33.640 --> 09:37.709
I guess I could say that Luke
kinda got left on the back-burner a lot.

09:37.711 --> 09:41.012
<i>I do remember when my mom
and stepdad split,</i>

09:41.014 --> 09:42.581
<i>it hurt him really bad.</i>

09:42.583 --> 09:43.982
<i>My mom and my stepdad,</i>

09:43.984 --> 09:46.651
<i>they've had at least
three separations</i>

09:46.653 --> 09:48.520
<i>in our lifetime.</i>

09:48.522 --> 09:50.889
Literally can't
get married again,

09:50.891 --> 09:53.425
and if they happen to divorce
in the state of Texas, it's...

09:53.893 --> 09:55.894
They've reached their limit.

09:55.896 --> 10:00.265
<i>But basically, anything that's
emotionally traumatic for Lucas</i>

10:00.766 --> 10:02.834
<i>causes him to binge eat</i>

10:02.836 --> 10:04.836
<i>and not take care of himself.</i>

10:04.838 --> 10:08.106
And it really does
affect us emotionally.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.476
<i>[Lucas] My weight increased
to 300 pounds.</i>

10:11.478 --> 10:12.744
<i>When I hit high school,</i>

10:12.746 --> 10:14.746
<i>that's when I started
playing football.</i>

10:14.748 --> 10:17.382
And my coaches
were my impact factor.

10:17.384 --> 10:19.017
They were the ones
that pushed me.

10:19.051 --> 10:20.852
<i>Going into sophomore year,</i>

10:20.854 --> 10:22.754
<i>I weighed close to 400 pounds</i>

10:22.756 --> 10:24.656
<i>and this coach just told me,</i>

10:24.658 --> 10:26.858
"Hey, if you wanna be
playing football with us,

10:26.860 --> 10:28.560
you gotta lose the weight."

10:28.562 --> 10:30.195
And I was like,
"I have to do it."

10:31.864 --> 10:35.367
<i>[Glenn] I don't remember
him over-eating.</i>

10:35.369 --> 10:38.403
<i>When he played football,
he was big.</i>

10:38.405 --> 10:41.973
So big, the coach made him
lose weight to play football.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.275
And he did that,
did that very successfully.

10:44.610 --> 10:45.777
<i>He dropped 100 pounds.</i>

10:45.779 --> 10:47.879
<i>He had his mind set
to play football.</i>

10:47.881 --> 10:51.783
<i>And the doctor gave him
a diet to stay on,</i>

10:51.785 --> 10:53.051
<i>and he'd done it,
he'd done good.</i>

10:53.053 --> 10:55.186
<i>He was a go-getter.</i>

10:55.188 --> 10:56.955
Junior year, I lost 75 pounds.

10:56.957 --> 10:59.991
I went from 375 down to 300.

10:59.993 --> 11:01.559
And then on my senior year,

11:01.561 --> 11:03.662
<i>I dropped another 50 pounds.</i>

11:03.664 --> 11:06.564
<i>And I was around 250,
close to 240,</i>

11:06.566 --> 11:08.166
<i>and I had never felt better,</i>

11:08.168 --> 11:10.268
<i>it was the best time in my life.</i>

11:11.037 --> 11:12.671
Ready for prayer.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.272
- God is good.
- [together] God is good.

11:14.274 --> 11:15.840
- God is great.
- [together] God is great.

11:15.842 --> 11:18.677
- We thank you for our food.
- [together] We thank you for our food.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.446
- Amen. Thank you, Jesus.
- Amen. Thank you, Jesus.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.817
<i>[Lucas] But then
football season ended</i>

11:25.819 --> 11:29.654
<i>and we were no longer
required to work out.</i>

11:29.656 --> 11:32.257
<i>That's when the success
turned into a failure.</i>

11:32.259 --> 11:35.694
I didn't stay on my regimen
and I just gained it all back.

11:35.696 --> 11:38.963
<i>That's when I got into my
addiction to videogames, as well.</i>

11:38.965 --> 11:43.168
<i>I remember graduating
weighing about 320 pounds.</i>

11:43.469 --> 11:44.636
<i>After high school,</i>

11:44.638 --> 11:47.572
<i>I moved in with my brother
in Corpus Christi</i>

11:47.574 --> 11:50.542
and I started working at a
pizza place while going to college.

11:50.544 --> 11:54.245
And in that pizza place, I would be
given free pizza almost every night.

11:55.848 --> 11:59.517
<i>And it became
a downward spiral after that.</i>

11:59.519 --> 12:01.486
<i>I started gaining
a lot of weight.</i>

12:01.488 --> 12:04.989
<i>Going to college,
I went from 300 to 400 pounds</i>

12:04.991 --> 12:07.425
<i>and then 500 pounds
going into my 20s.</i>

12:07.427 --> 12:09.728
<i>I was actually really close
to graduating,</i>

12:09.730 --> 12:13.164
<i>but my dad wanted me to drop
out of school and learn a trade.</i>

12:13.166 --> 12:14.632
<i>And he's been a machinist
most of his life,</i>

12:14.634 --> 12:17.969
<i>so I tried to go into machining.</i>

12:17.971 --> 12:20.371
<i>Problem was, it's not
something I really enjoyed.</i>

12:22.675 --> 12:23.942
<i>[Glenn] What he wants to do,</i>

12:23.944 --> 12:25.110
<i>he's not been able to do it.</i>

12:25.112 --> 12:26.644
<i>He likes videogames</i>

12:26.646 --> 12:29.948
and that's...
I guess that's fine.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.951
<i>But I grew up being a part
of the Vietnam War.</i>

12:32.953 --> 12:34.419
<i>In our mind frame,</i>

12:34.421 --> 12:36.788
<i>you can't push reset
and start a new game.</i>

12:36.790 --> 12:38.423
<i>You had to live your life.</i>

12:40.025 --> 12:41.826
All right, y'all ready,
you can clean up

12:41.828 --> 12:42.827
and then we start school, okay?

12:42.829 --> 12:45.964
- [both] Okay.
- Start cleaning up.

12:47.566 --> 12:50.034
<i>My next job was three
or four years later.</i>

12:50.036 --> 12:52.537
<i>I was working
doing grocery delivery.</i>

12:52.539 --> 12:54.672
<i>It was working at first,</i>

12:54.674 --> 12:55.640
<i>and then things
got really stressful</i>

12:55.642 --> 12:58.209
and it just got... [sighs]

12:58.211 --> 13:00.745
it got really difficult to handle
the depression and anxiety.

13:00.747 --> 13:02.914
<i>And so I had put
my 30-day notice in</i>

13:02.916 --> 13:05.383
<i>for being discharged medically
and I crashed.</i>

13:05.951 --> 13:07.619
<i>And fast-forward to...</i>

13:07.621 --> 13:10.789
Now I'm in my 30s
and I'm at 600 pounds.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.991
Okay, Junior, I want you to go
get your books over here

13:12.993 --> 13:16.060
and get set up
right there, okay?

13:16.062 --> 13:17.562
Grace, I want you
to go get your books

13:17.564 --> 13:18.797
and set up right here, too.

13:18.799 --> 13:20.999
Make sure you bring
the pencils, too, okay?

13:21.834 --> 13:23.401
<i>And then know that my weight</i>

13:23.403 --> 13:25.403
<i>is contributing to my depression</i>

13:25.405 --> 13:27.138
<i>and I still can't stop eating</i>

13:27.907 --> 13:29.874
<i>because food is one
of the only things</i>

13:29.876 --> 13:31.109
<i>that makes me feel good.</i>

13:32.711 --> 13:34.412
I can't do this.

13:34.414 --> 13:35.780
Yes, you can. Come here.

13:35.782 --> 13:36.748
I have to clean it up, okay?

13:36.750 --> 13:38.383
So, I'll do that.

13:39.919 --> 13:41.653
<i>At this point,
I can't really get a job.</i>

13:41.655 --> 13:45.089
<i>Or not a normal one, anyway.</i>

13:45.091 --> 13:48.193
<i>Thankfully, my sister has been
able to find work for me to do.</i>

13:48.828 --> 13:50.895
What does this mean?

13:50.897 --> 13:53.031
I don't know, let me read it
for you, okay?

13:54.633 --> 13:58.403
"Patty Pig picks peppers
to sell at the market.

13:58.405 --> 14:00.405
Help Patty track her peppers."

14:00.407 --> 14:03.741
Oh, okay, got it. That's easy.

14:03.743 --> 14:09.380
[Lucas] My job today is I teach my
little niece and nephew, with homeschool,

14:09.382 --> 14:14.552
and then I also babysit them whenever
their parents need me to babysit.

14:14.554 --> 14:19.424
<i>[Maegen] I had gotten the idea to
employ my brother homeschooling my kids</i>

14:19.426 --> 14:22.493
mostly to help him
kind of financially.

14:22.495 --> 14:27.031
But seeing him spending time
with his niece and nephew,

14:27.033 --> 14:32.003
<i>it makes me happy because beforehand
they didn't spend any time together.</i>

14:32.005 --> 14:34.105
But he's very smart,

14:34.107 --> 14:38.309
he retains almost everything
he learned in school.

14:38.544 --> 14:39.611
<i>So, yeah...</i>

14:39.613 --> 14:42.981
<i>He's the perfect
candidate to teach them.</i>

14:43.816 --> 14:45.583
This letter, Grace,
what's this letter say?

14:45.585 --> 14:48.853
<i>- G. G!
- There you go, g.</i>

14:48.855 --> 14:51.222
All right, you wanna
get the books for me?

14:51.224 --> 14:52.924
- Yeah.
- Okay. Thank you so much.

14:52.926 --> 14:53.925
Okay.

14:53.927 --> 14:55.393
Your mom's gonna be home soon

14:55.395 --> 14:58.196
so y'all go ahead
and watch some TV, okay?

15:06.472 --> 15:08.306
- Howdy, bubba.
- Hey.

15:09.308 --> 15:12.143
All right, we'll go shopping
at the grocery store.

15:24.189 --> 15:28.059
<i>[Lucas] I haven't been to a grocery
store on my own for four or five years.</i>

15:28.360 --> 15:30.295
[Lucas pants]

15:32.932 --> 15:36.768
<i>At this size, the thought
of falling over in public</i>

15:36.770 --> 15:39.237
<i>is about enough to keep me
from ever going anywhere.</i>

15:53.986 --> 15:55.620
Let's grab some of these.

15:55.622 --> 15:58.323
- Oh, get those.
- Cinnabons, all right.

16:00.659 --> 16:02.527
<i>Once I'm there,
I can lean on the cart</i>

16:02.529 --> 16:04.529
<i>or ride in the motorized cart,</i>

16:04.531 --> 16:07.098
<i>but I wouldn't be able
to come here without Maegen.</i>

16:07.566 --> 16:10.735
Can you grab some bacon?
A couple of them.

16:10.737 --> 16:14.138
- This one?
- Yeah, let's grab about two more of those.

16:14.840 --> 16:18.977
<i>Even though I'm living with my
family basically almost for free,</i>

16:18.979 --> 16:21.079
<i>I don't like being dependent
on other people.</i>

16:21.081 --> 16:23.014
<i>It makes me feel weak.</i>

16:23.048 --> 16:24.849
Let's grab one of each.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.851
<i>And as much as I love my family</i>

16:26.853 --> 16:28.252
<i>and I'm grateful for them,</i>

16:28.254 --> 16:31.022
<i>I know that being dependent
on them is part of the problem.</i>

16:31.790 --> 16:32.523
You want any chips?

16:32.525 --> 16:34.392
Yeah, let's grab some of these.

16:36.061 --> 16:39.397
<i>But also because of the motions
that go along with living with my family</i>

16:39.399 --> 16:40.798
<i>are stressful.</i>

16:40.800 --> 16:43.501
<i>And as much as I appreciate
their help, it's difficult.</i>

16:43.503 --> 16:44.869
<i>I don't tell my family this</i>

16:44.871 --> 16:49.340
because I don't want them
feeling like they're responsible for it.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.744
Where I live today has been a
big factor of my increasing weight

16:52.746 --> 16:55.813
<i>'cause a lot of my stress
and anxiety comes from them.</i>

16:55.815 --> 16:58.549
<i>Whenever they stress me out,
or they fight,</i>

16:58.551 --> 17:00.885
or they argue with me
or something like that,

17:00.887 --> 17:04.889
I have to go and eat
something, and I hate it.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.791
- Is this enough?
- That'll be enough.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.459
- All right.
- Should be enough.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.061
<i>But hopefully that'll change.</i>

17:10.063 --> 17:13.931
<i>Hopefully, I can take away
the habit and do better coping,</i>

17:13.966 --> 17:16.200
because it really is on me

17:16.202 --> 17:18.403
when I decide
if I wanna eat or not.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.051
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.385
Y'all have a wonderful day.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.055
[panting]

17:50.769 --> 17:52.336
[breathing heavily] Okay.

18:42.287 --> 18:44.689
I'm not gonna be able
to do anything tonight.

18:44.691 --> 18:47.125
- That was a lot of walking for you.
- Mmm-hmm.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.093
<i>[Maegen] Seeing my brother</i>

18:49.095 --> 18:50.862
<i>trying to do things for himself</i>

18:50.864 --> 18:52.330
<i>and being in so much pain,</i>

18:52.664 --> 18:54.799
<i>it really breaks my heart.</i>

18:54.801 --> 18:57.401
<i>Us watching him, my mom,
my dad especially,</i>

18:57.403 --> 18:58.669
<i>it's heartbreaking.</i>

18:58.671 --> 19:00.872
<i>It's kind of devastating,
almost.</i>

19:00.874 --> 19:04.208
- All right, good night, bub.
- Good night, Maegen.

19:10.949 --> 19:12.950
<i>Given my current living
and income situation,</i>

19:12.952 --> 19:17.822
<i>I don't see myself being able to
get out of this without outside help.</i>

19:17.824 --> 19:19.957
<i>I know that how
I'm living right now</i>

19:19.959 --> 19:21.425
<i>can't go on for much longer.</i>

19:21.827 --> 19:23.261
I wake up hopeless

19:23.263 --> 19:24.695
and desperate
for something to change.

19:26.932 --> 19:30.134
<i>This feels like this is my last
chance to turn my life around.</i>

19:30.136 --> 19:33.304
<i>Otherwise, I'm stuck
in this storage shed,</i>

19:33.939 --> 19:35.206
<i>waiting to die.</i>

19:56.128 --> 19:57.528
- Hey, bub.
- Hey.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.996
You excited, you ready?

19:58.998 --> 20:01.832
Yeah, I'm nervous.
I'm pretty ready, though.

20:01.834 --> 20:02.733
We got a drive ahead of us.

20:02.735 --> 20:05.002
All right, let's get going.

20:05.004 --> 20:08.072
<i>Today, my sister Maegen
is gonna drive me to Houston.</i>

20:08.607 --> 20:12.176
- Ready when you are.
- Yeah, let's go.

20:12.178 --> 20:14.278
<i>So I can meet Dr. Now
and try to get on the path</i>

20:14.280 --> 20:17.415
<i>to having him do
weight loss surgery on me.</i>

20:17.417 --> 20:20.718
<i>I'm definitely nervous and
scared of getting rejected.</i>

20:20.720 --> 20:22.853
<i>But funny enough,
when I woke up this morning,</i>

20:22.855 --> 20:25.723
<i>I felt kinda great
because today is really</i>

20:25.725 --> 20:27.792
<i>just, like,
the best day of my life</i>

20:27.794 --> 20:30.094
<i>because it's basically
when I start fixing my life</i>

20:30.096 --> 20:31.896
<i>way it needs to be.</i>

20:31.898 --> 20:33.664
<i>I'm ready to go see Dr. Now</i>

20:33.666 --> 20:36.867
<i>and I believe
he can help me out.</i>

20:36.869 --> 20:37.602
<i>Because once I lose
all this weight,</i>

20:37.604 --> 20:39.737
<i>I'll be able to be more mobile</i>

20:39.739 --> 20:43.040
<i>and I won't have to sit in the
back seat of the car like this.</i>

20:45.310 --> 20:47.278
<i>And I'll be able to do
a lot more in my life.</i>

20:48.947 --> 20:51.315
<i>I'll be able to move out,
get a better job...</i>

20:51.650 --> 20:53.251
<i>I'll be able to do a lot more.</i>

21:03.895 --> 21:08.132
So, when was the last time
you actually weighed yourself?

21:10.802 --> 21:12.336
The last time I weighed myself

21:12.871 --> 21:15.740
I think I was 545 pounds

21:15.742 --> 21:19.744
and that was back
in 20... 2017.

21:19.746 --> 21:21.846
You haven't stepped
on a scale since?

21:21.848 --> 21:23.014
No, I don't want to, I'm scared.

21:23.016 --> 21:24.415
Hey, I don't blame you.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.384
<i>I lost all that weight, right?</i>

21:26.386 --> 21:28.753
And then I put it all back on
in a matter of a couple months.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.989
I haven't stepped on a scale
since I weighted 135.

21:38.964 --> 21:42.099
I just... I'm really...
I'm still nervous, so...

21:42.634 --> 21:44.769
You can do this.
I've seen you drop

21:44.771 --> 21:49.573
an enormous amount of weight
for football, you know?

21:49.575 --> 21:52.910
This is for your life,
not just for some game.

21:52.912 --> 21:56.847
This is... You're starting
your life basically over.

21:56.849 --> 21:59.016
<i>[Lucas] A lot of my life,
it's been, um...</i>

21:59.018 --> 22:01.552
<i>There was times where I was
so deep in a hole</i>

22:01.554 --> 22:03.654
<i>where I just wanted
to end it all.</i>

22:03.656 --> 22:05.890
<i>And having my sister Maegen,
she's like,</i>

22:05.892 --> 22:09.126
<i>"Hey I'm here for you,
I'm here to help you.</i>

22:09.128 --> 22:11.062
<i>And I'm here cheering you on."</i>

22:11.064 --> 22:12.129
I'm ready.

22:12.131 --> 22:15.199
<i>I really am very happy
I have that in my life.</i>

22:36.688 --> 22:37.554
Thank you.

22:50.936 --> 22:54.305
- Doing good?
- Just hot today, humid.

22:54.606 --> 22:55.906
Yeah.

22:55.908 --> 22:58.442
- Nervous meeting him too?
- [sighs] Nervous.

23:00.479 --> 23:02.046
Lucas.

23:07.552 --> 23:11.756
<i>[Lucas] I feel very nervous
about what the scale's gonna say.</i>

23:11.758 --> 23:15.292
<i>Because it's almost been five
years since I've stepped on a scale.</i>

23:17.362 --> 23:18.896
Okay, you can step up
on the scale.

23:18.898 --> 23:21.499
<i>[Lucas] I'm hoping that
I haven't gained any weight.</i>

23:21.501 --> 23:25.035
<i>That's I'm still somewhere
in the mid-500's.</i>

23:25.037 --> 23:28.005
<i>And that I'm not worse off than
I've been thinking this whole time.</i>

23:29.775 --> 23:31.442
[suspenseful music playing]

23:49.628 --> 23:53.397
Your weight is 619.
You can step off.

23:57.402 --> 24:00.070
- [nurse] And we're gonna be going to room five.
- Room five?

24:00.072 --> 24:01.405
Yes, sir.

24:06.011 --> 24:10.080
<i>I was pretty surprised to
see my weight at 619 pounds.</i>

24:10.082 --> 24:14.785
<i>I thought I was still gonna be in the
500's area, maybe in the high 500's.</i>

24:14.787 --> 24:19.290
And I'm over 600 and I'm
well into it now and it's scary.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.331
[knocking at door]

24:30.402 --> 24:32.203
Hello, how y'all doing?

24:32.205 --> 24:33.771
-Good.
-[Lucas] Doing all right, sir. How're you doing?

24:33.773 --> 24:35.105
Good.

24:35.740 --> 24:38.042
- You must be Lucas, yeah?
- Yes, sir.

24:38.044 --> 24:40.411
All right,
where you coming from?

24:40.413 --> 24:41.812
We come from Conroe, Texas.

24:41.814 --> 24:44.048
Conroe, Texas.

24:44.050 --> 24:47.785
All right, and you are
over 600 pounds, huh?

24:47.787 --> 24:48.619
Yes, sir.

24:48.621 --> 24:51.989
And you only 33 years old, huh?

24:51.991 --> 24:55.960
- Yes, sir.
- Okay. So, you've been overweight for a while.

24:58.930 --> 24:59.930
Yes, sir.

24:59.932 --> 25:03.267
- And, are you working?
- No, sir. I can't work.

25:03.269 --> 25:04.735
How long
you haven't been working?

25:04.737 --> 25:06.837
It's been over a year now.

25:06.839 --> 25:09.673
And before that, what
kind of job were you doing?

25:09.675 --> 25:11.842
I was a pizza delivery driver.

25:11.844 --> 25:14.478
That's unfortunate
for your situation.

25:14.480 --> 25:16.780
And got to the point
that you couldn't do it?

25:16.782 --> 25:18.749
Got to the point that I
just couldn't do it anymore.

25:18.751 --> 25:22.887
So, what is going on
with your eating habits?

25:22.889 --> 25:26.757
My eating habits is more related
to my stress and my depression.

25:26.759 --> 25:30.728
And when I feel stress
or anxiety, I eat.

25:30.730 --> 25:34.164
I tend to eat
when I feel that, I snack.

25:34.166 --> 25:37.701
And then during meals,
I tend to overeat.

25:37.703 --> 25:42.706
Could it be that you convince yourself
that it's stress that's making you eating?

25:42.708 --> 25:46.577
I try to convince myself
to just find different ways,

25:46.579 --> 25:49.547
but I tend to become addicted
to certain things.

25:49.549 --> 25:54.985
Like, videogaming or watching
TV, sitting down and doing nothing.

25:54.987 --> 26:00.824
Just trying to escape those things
that cause me to eat, stress and anxiety.

26:00.826 --> 26:03.193
So, it becomes very,
very difficult.

26:12.971 --> 26:14.838
I usually eat at home,
for the most part.

26:14.840 --> 26:17.074
But sometimes
I do go get fast food.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.709
All right,
so what do you do all day?

26:18.711 --> 26:25.849
Uh, I mostly help out the family by
babysitting and teaching my sister's kids.

26:25.851 --> 26:28.118
Um, but, most of the time,
I'm sitting down.

26:28.120 --> 26:31.789
And my activity is very,
like, scarce.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.724
I don't do very much.

26:33.726 --> 26:36.393
And it's very, very, very
little that we move around.

26:36.395 --> 26:37.828
So, do you choose to overeat?

26:37.830 --> 26:41.632
Or does somebody push you
to overeat in the family?

26:41.634 --> 26:44.735
I tend to overeat myself,
I tend to choose that.

26:44.737 --> 26:48.939
I don't... I don't think
anybody really enables me.

26:49.841 --> 26:51.342
- It's just me.
- Is he telling me the truth?

26:52.043 --> 26:54.011
Um, yes. Mostly, yes.

26:54.379 --> 26:55.646
Mostly, huh?

26:55.713 --> 26:59.717
We've already established a
dynamic that the family feeds him.

26:59.719 --> 27:03.687
So, are you all doing anything
to help him lose weight?

27:03.689 --> 27:07.524
We do. We have been
trying for years to help him.

27:07.526 --> 27:10.394
Do you all bring him
food to eat, too?

27:10.396 --> 27:15.399
I... I'll bring him lunch sometimes
when he's watching my kids. Yeah.

27:15.401 --> 27:18.736
So, you think you are helping
him to bring him some food?

27:18.738 --> 27:22.806
Or, is that because you are showing
that you like him or you love him?

27:22.808 --> 27:26.410
It's because I'm not gonna
feed my kids and not,

27:26.412 --> 27:29.380
you know,
have food for my brother.

27:29.382 --> 27:33.417
And if he's happy, he keeps
doing what you want, right?

27:33.419 --> 27:37.888
Um, no, I'm just trying to make
sure he has what he needs.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.958
All right. Lucas, do you
have any goal in your life?

27:41.025 --> 27:42.826
- Goal?
- Yeah.

27:42.828 --> 27:45.663
I would like to become
an IT tech.

27:45.665 --> 27:49.767
I would like to get back into
working again as one of my goals.

27:49.769 --> 27:52.436
Um, it's just that
unfortunately I don't...

27:52.438 --> 27:55.372
I can't work to make the money
to go to school.

27:55.374 --> 28:00.444
I can't afford online classes
or anything like that.

28:00.446 --> 28:04.581
I don't want to ask my family for
the money to do something like that.

28:04.583 --> 28:08.652
Okay. And, what are you
willing to do to change all that?

28:08.654 --> 28:10.854
I'm willing to change
everything, sir.

28:10.856 --> 28:11.755
[Meagen] Whatever it takes.

28:11.757 --> 28:13.457
Whatever it takes.

28:13.459 --> 28:18.829
To the point where even if I have
to come up with different habits to...

28:18.831 --> 28:21.498
To go through my anxiety,
to go through my stress.

28:21.500 --> 28:24.034
[Meagen] To be able to
deal with it right.

28:24.036 --> 28:28.272
To deal with it properly, instead of
just going to something that comforts me.

28:28.274 --> 28:33.010
All right, so, what we need to do
is try to change your eating habit.

28:33.012 --> 28:36.346
So the first step is gonna be
that you have to discipline yourself.

28:36.348 --> 28:37.948
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

28:37.950 --> 28:41.785
What I wanna do is give you some stuff
that I want you to start reading those.

28:41.787 --> 28:44.288
And also gonna give you
some exercise.

28:44.290 --> 28:46.757
So I'm gonna bring you
some instruction.

28:46.759 --> 28:48.625
Want you to follow those things,

28:48.627 --> 28:49.960
and I'm gonna give you
four weeks.

28:49.962 --> 28:52.730
And if you do that, I want you
to lose 30 pounds in one month.

28:52.732 --> 28:55.332
And stick with
the health eating habits.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.968
If you do that, then we're
gonna be able to help you out.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.904
But if you come back and
you haven't lost any weight,

29:00.906 --> 29:02.439
then there's not much we can do.

29:02.441 --> 29:06.410
Because you're not gonna be able to
tolerate any kind of surgery at this point.

29:06.412 --> 29:07.711
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

29:07.713 --> 29:10.714
All right, so, let me go
get some stuff for you.

29:10.716 --> 29:13.317
And bring it for you
and we go over it, okay?

29:13.319 --> 29:15.953
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

29:21.526 --> 29:26.396
My biggest concern with Lucas is that
he seems to have a dynamic of household

29:26.398 --> 29:28.832
<i>that encourage him to eat more.</i>

29:28.834 --> 29:33.704
He was delivering pizza which wasn't
a great occupation for his situation.

29:33.706 --> 29:37.775
<i>But at least he was active
and out on his own.</i>

29:37.777 --> 29:42.579
<i>But now that he can't do that,
he's become an in-house babysitter.</i>

29:42.581 --> 29:45.949
And I think the family maybe
enjoys that dynamic with him.

29:45.951 --> 29:48.552
<i>Where they can count on him
to stay at home.</i>

29:48.554 --> 29:51.789
<i>And doing what they need all
day, as long as he's like this.</i>

29:51.791 --> 29:55.459
So that is an issue,
because they are enabling him.

29:55.461 --> 30:00.130
<i>And this is not helping him
to be productive for himself.</i>

30:00.932 --> 30:07.771
All right, so, the first
thing I wanted to focus on

30:07.773 --> 30:11.408
is this, that I want
you to read everyday.

30:11.410 --> 30:15.813
It's a 1,200 calorie,
low-carb, high protein diet.

30:15.815 --> 30:19.550
That we will go over that I
want you to start today, okay?

30:19.552 --> 30:20.384
Yes, sir.

30:20.386 --> 30:22.820
Then I also have
some exercises for you

30:22.822 --> 30:25.656
that I want you to do everyday.

30:25.658 --> 30:30.427
It's gonna be up to Lucas to start
to break free from the cycle he's in.

30:30.429 --> 30:32.696
<i>And the dynamic he has at home.</i>

30:32.698 --> 30:35.699
<i>I gave him a goal to lose
30 pounds in one month.</i>

30:35.701 --> 30:37.968
<i>If he sticks with
the 1,200 calorie diet,</i>

30:37.970 --> 30:39.603
<i>he can lose three times of that.</i>

30:39.605 --> 30:41.805
So, I gave him a very easy goal.

30:41.807 --> 30:46.743
<i>And, what I'm hoping is, that
if he just takes the first step</i>

30:46.745 --> 30:50.747
<i>to change his eating habits,
in even a small way.</i>

30:50.749 --> 30:54.484
<i>If he does then he will see
that he will start to feel better</i>

30:54.552 --> 30:55.619
in his depression.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.888
<i>And how he feels
will start to improve</i>

30:57.890 --> 31:01.291
<i>as he slowly comes out
of that cycle he's in.</i>

31:01.293 --> 31:04.828
<i>That starts with his unhealthy
eating habits.</i>

31:04.830 --> 31:09.766
So the bar is low for him to start
to turn things around for himself.

31:09.768 --> 31:11.969
<i>But if he takes this first step,</i>

31:11.971 --> 31:16.106
<i>it will get easier for him
and we can help him.</i>

31:16.108 --> 31:20.177
So, you start doing that and then we're
gonna see how you do in the four weeks.

31:20.179 --> 31:21.812
- Okay?
- Okay, sir.

31:21.814 --> 31:25.415
And it's gonna be all up to you to
make the changes that you need.

31:25.417 --> 31:27.117
- All right?
- Yes, sir.

31:27.119 --> 31:30.120
- Okay, nice to meet you all.
- [Lucas] Nice to meet you too, sir.

31:30.122 --> 31:31.221
Okay.

31:36.394 --> 31:37.794
Let me see that.

31:38.763 --> 31:42.566
I think this is what's gonna help
you drop the weight really fast.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.801
- Mom and I are doing this with you.
- Okay.

31:44.803 --> 31:47.104
She may not be able to do
the intermittent fasting

31:47.106 --> 31:50.841
but she's definitely doing
the diet.

31:50.843 --> 31:55.412
<i>[Lucas] I didn't want to say, "Oh, no,
my sister's the one that gives me food."</i>

31:55.414 --> 31:58.348
<i>Yes, on a regular basis
we do, kinda, eat pretty bad.</i>

31:58.350 --> 32:01.818
But I feel like my family doesn't
really enable me, it's more of me.

32:01.820 --> 32:05.222
Cause I can make my own
decisions, so I put it more on myself.

32:05.224 --> 32:07.024
- This starts...
- Today?

32:07.026 --> 32:07.991
- Yeah.
- [Lucas] Today.

32:07.993 --> 32:10.160
- Today.
- [Lucas] Today.

32:10.895 --> 32:14.031
We gotta throw out
all that stuff.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.435
- No more temptations.
- No more temptations.

32:19.037 --> 32:21.705
- So.
- Oh, my kids are gonna hate me.

32:21.707 --> 32:23.173
- Okay, come on.
- Oh, well.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.443
- [Meagen] Good?
- Yep.

32:30.481 --> 32:32.316
I was really nervous
when he first came in.

32:32.318 --> 32:35.752
<i>Dr. Now is somebody
I don't want to disappoint.</i>

32:35.754 --> 32:39.323
<i>He's someone who's gonna decide
whether or not I'm gonna get the surgery.</i>

32:39.325 --> 32:42.092
I can definitely feel the,
like, aura around him.

32:42.094 --> 32:44.861
Where you can definitely see
him being, like, a coach figure.

32:44.863 --> 32:47.397
<i>What he sounded like was
what my coach sounded like,</i>

32:47.399 --> 32:48.832
<i>hey, you need
to lose this weight</i>

32:48.834 --> 32:50.300
<i>or you're not gonna be
able to play.</i>

32:50.302 --> 32:51.668
And for him it's like,

32:51.670 --> 32:53.337
hey you need to lose this weight,
or your not gonna get this surgery.

32:55.873 --> 32:58.408
<i>And it made me feel like,
okay, then I'll definitely do it.</i>

32:59.711 --> 33:02.212
I feel motivated.
Like I can do this.

33:02.847 --> 33:04.982
Like I definitely can do this.

33:14.492 --> 33:17.394
Missing Mars
and you're missing Venus, so.

33:17.396 --> 33:20.664
Um, Mars is right here.
So, this is Venus.

33:20.666 --> 33:24.634
<i>[Lucas] The first few weeks of doing
Dr. Now diet and exercise program,</i>

33:24.636 --> 33:26.870
<i>basically getting control
of my eating habits,</i>

33:26.872 --> 33:29.773
<i>it's been
a pretty big adjustment.</i>

33:29.775 --> 33:32.676
<i>It's been
a very tough challenge.</i>

33:32.678 --> 33:35.412
<i>There were many struggles
that I have encountered.</i>

33:35.414 --> 33:37.714
<i>The good news is,
most of the time,</i>

33:37.716 --> 33:39.483
<i>I have the kids to keep me busy.</i>

33:39.485 --> 33:41.885
- I'm done!
- [Lucas] Yay!

33:41.887 --> 33:44.554
<i>And I've been trying
to throw myself into that.</i>

33:44.556 --> 33:46.723
<i>And trying to push myself
to do more with them.</i>

33:46.725 --> 33:49.226
We're gonna have PE.
Y'all ready for PE?

33:49.228 --> 33:51.928
We're gonna do jumping jacks
and we're gonna play with the ball.

33:51.996 --> 33:53.397
Okay?

33:53.399 --> 33:54.931
I'll meet you guys outside,
okay?

33:54.933 --> 33:56.767
<i>Days when I have to watch
the kids,</i>

33:56.769 --> 33:59.836
<i>it's actually difficult to get
everything done for Dr. Now.</i>

33:59.838 --> 34:02.406
<i>That I'm supposed to do,
in terms of exercise.</i>

34:02.408 --> 34:05.375
[Robert] What a good day
to do some recess.

34:07.211 --> 34:09.546
<i>[Lucas] So this week,
I'm trying to combine it.</i>

34:09.548 --> 34:12.282
<i>To where I get some exercise
during the homeschool hours.</i>

34:12.284 --> 34:14.885
<i>So today, I'm taking
them outside with me</i>

34:14.887 --> 34:18.955
<i>and getting my exercises in
that way, as part of their PE class.</i>

34:18.957 --> 34:20.991
Come on, we're gonna do jumping
jacks. You know how to do jumping jacks?

34:20.993 --> 34:23.193
I think.
Like this?

34:23.195 --> 34:25.062
Like that.
Can you do it for me?

34:27.698 --> 34:29.900
That was pretty good.
Try it again.

34:29.902 --> 34:32.202
[Lucas] Okay,
I'm gonna try it too.

34:33.738 --> 34:34.638
Okay?

34:34.640 --> 34:36.239
That's really hard for me.

34:36.241 --> 34:37.974
We're gonna do 10 of those,
all right?

34:38.042 --> 34:39.409
One, two,

34:39.977 --> 34:41.378
three, four,

34:41.879 --> 34:43.046
five, six--

34:43.048 --> 34:44.314
<i>And it's going good.</i>

34:44.549 --> 34:47.784
eight, nine, ten.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.253
Okay. Can one of y'all
get me the chair over there?

34:51.889 --> 34:52.956
[Grace] Play catch now?

34:52.958 --> 34:54.291
Yeah, we're gonna
play catch now.

34:54.992 --> 34:57.260
- [Grace] Okay.
- Hang on.

34:59.397 --> 35:00.664
[Robert] I love this day!

35:00.666 --> 35:03.400
- We're gonna have to stand up for this one, okay?
- Okay.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.802
[Robert] It's pretty hard for
him to get up, it take a bit.

35:05.804 --> 35:08.071
- Okay.
- [Robert] Oh, wow!

35:09.006 --> 35:11.141
<i>These days I've been
more tired than ever.</i>

35:11.709 --> 35:13.143
This is good exercise.

35:13.711 --> 35:15.312
<i>But it's a good kind of tired.</i>

35:16.047 --> 35:17.948
<i>That feels like I've earned it.</i>

35:18.015 --> 35:19.249
Um, are you okay?

35:19.917 --> 35:21.218
I'll be fine, man.

35:22.420 --> 35:23.987
Just have to catch my breath.

35:24.288 --> 35:25.322
I'll be all right.

35:27.525 --> 35:29.126
Okay.

35:29.128 --> 35:31.661
- All right, who's ready for lunch?
- [kids] Me!

35:31.663 --> 35:33.763
You. All right. I'll meet
y'all in the house, okay?

35:33.765 --> 35:35.432
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

35:38.402 --> 35:39.836
<i>And there has been
a lot of struggles</i>

35:39.838 --> 35:41.805
<i>where I had to overcome
the cravings.</i>

35:41.807 --> 35:44.040
<i>Or the desire to go eat.</i>

35:48.012 --> 35:50.447
<i>I'm trying to do the diet
by making my own meals.</i>

35:50.449 --> 35:51.615
Hey, kiddos.

35:51.617 --> 35:54.618
<i>And not eating anything else
that anyone brings in.</i>

35:54.620 --> 35:58.355
<i>Because my family's still eating
some bad stuff around the edges.</i>

35:59.924 --> 36:03.293
[Robert] When you're gonna play,
mommy and I are gonna play chess.

36:04.228 --> 36:05.996
[Grace] Chess.

36:05.998 --> 36:09.933
<i>But I've been counting calories
the way Dr. Now said to in this book.</i>

36:11.536 --> 36:15.639
<i>And I'm pretty sure I'm staying
in my right range that I need to hit,</i>

36:15.641 --> 36:18.808
<i>to get to the goal he gave me
of losing 30 pounds this month.</i>

36:18.810 --> 36:21.878
Mommy's trying to remember
how to set this up.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.014
<i>My sister has been
showing me support.</i>

36:24.016 --> 36:28.018
<i>And she's the one pushing me more
than anyone to do Dr. Now program.</i>

36:28.619 --> 36:31.221
Serving size is 3 ounces.

36:34.058 --> 36:38.828
4.5 ounces
for nine pieces of chicken.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.730
So how many calories is that?

36:40.732 --> 36:42.232
That's 167 calories.

36:42.867 --> 36:43.933
Are you good with that?

36:43.935 --> 36:46.970
- That should be pretty good.
- You can afford that?

36:46.972 --> 36:48.371
<i>[Meagen] Lucas has been doing
really well.</i>

36:48.406 --> 36:51.641
<i>I'm super proud of him.</i>

36:51.643 --> 36:56.980
<i>I know how hard it is and seeing him
overcome that is really great to watch.</i>

36:57.415 --> 36:59.849
<i>In fact,
he's been doing so well,</i>

36:59.851 --> 37:03.720
<i>that he's getting better
almost a little too fast for me.</i>

37:03.722 --> 37:05.889
<i>Because it means
that pretty soon</i>

37:05.891 --> 37:07.524
<i>I'm gonna need a new babysitter</i>

37:07.526 --> 37:09.893
<i>and a new homeschool teacher.</i>

37:09.895 --> 37:12.329
[Meagen] I'm still trying to figure
out what move I'm gonna make.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.497
<i>And it won't be easy
to find someone</i>

37:14.499 --> 37:17.934
<i>who's as much of a natural
for the job as Lucas's been.</i>

37:19.737 --> 37:21.805
<i>It's been really great
having him in that role.</i>

37:21.807 --> 37:23.807
[Meagen] Oh, that looks awesome!

37:23.809 --> 37:25.742
It does, it looks really good.

37:25.744 --> 37:29.412
<i>[Meagen] So, I've known
all along it is just temporary.</i>

37:29.414 --> 37:32.015
<i>And now it's actually happening.</i>

37:32.017 --> 37:33.950
<i>And we'll have to make
some adjustments.</i>

37:34.485 --> 37:38.421
<i>But, you know, we're all really
eager for him to get better.</i>

37:38.423 --> 37:43.426
<i>And seeing it happen before
our eyes, is really exciting.</i>

37:43.428 --> 37:47.931
<i>Having Lucas here at home he's
been, sorta, like a fixture around here.</i>

37:47.933 --> 37:49.766
<i>And it's gonna be
hard to see him go</i>

37:49.768 --> 37:53.837
<i>if he does succeed at this
and achieve what he wants.</i>

37:53.839 --> 37:58.942
<i>Which is to spread his wings
and go out into the world.</i>

37:58.944 --> 38:02.145
<i>Because he needs more
than this, and I know it.</i>

38:02.147 --> 38:04.914
Junior, get Mommy a spoon.

38:04.916 --> 38:06.216
Blue one? That's it.

38:06.450 --> 38:07.884
Careful.

38:07.886 --> 38:12.389
Meagen, I notice when I get...
When I eat slower I get fuller faster.

38:12.391 --> 38:16.092
Yeah, that's what I've been telling
you. You gotta drink, take a bite.

38:16.827 --> 38:17.927
And then drink a little bit.

38:17.929 --> 38:19.229
Take a bite.

38:19.231 --> 38:21.298
You know,
it fills you up faster.

38:21.866 --> 38:23.066
Yeah.

38:23.901 --> 38:25.502
[Meagen] Over here, Grace.

38:25.504 --> 38:27.837
<i>We love
having him here obviously.</i>

38:27.839 --> 38:31.508
<i>It makes me so happy
that he's here with my kids.</i>

38:31.510 --> 38:35.312
<i>And he's a great babysitter.
And homeschool teacher.</i>

38:35.314 --> 38:38.315
<i>But I also know
that he needs to get out.</i>

38:38.317 --> 38:41.851
<i>And experience more of
the world and get his life back.</i>

38:41.853 --> 38:45.789
<i>So that he can be an adult
and an independent person.</i>

38:45.791 --> 38:48.825
<i>Because he's really
never had that.</i>

38:48.827 --> 38:51.861
<i>And I think he's been ready
for that in his heart</i>

38:51.863 --> 38:54.264
<i>since before his body
has been ready.</i>

38:55.566 --> 38:58.368
<i>And now his body is catching up.</i>

38:58.370 --> 39:00.770
<i>So, we'll be sad to see him go.</i>

39:00.772 --> 39:04.774
<i>But really, really happy
that he's getting healthy.</i>

39:04.776 --> 39:08.411
<i>And then he'll be around
for a lot longer that way.</i>

39:08.413 --> 39:10.380
<i>If he can keep up the good work.</i>

39:24.895 --> 39:25.995
[Meagen] Voilà

39:49.887 --> 39:51.121
Lucas.

39:54.925 --> 39:57.093
- Hello.
- [nurse] Hello.

39:57.095 --> 39:58.762
- How are you today?
- [nurse] I'm good, how are you?

39:58.764 --> 40:00.630
I'm doing good.

40:00.632 --> 40:03.700
<i>[Lucas] At my first appointment
a month ago, I weighed 619.</i>

40:03.702 --> 40:06.035
- You can step on the scale.
- Okay.

40:07.671 --> 40:10.874
<i>[Lucas] And Dr. Now told me
to lose 30 pounds.</i>

40:10.876 --> 40:14.310
<i>So if I did that, I should
be under 589 right now.</i>

40:15.880 --> 40:19.416
<i>And I really hope that I am, because
I can't take a big failure right now.</i>

40:21.886 --> 40:24.053
Your weight is 590.

40:25.055 --> 40:26.556
- [Meagen] Yay!
- Yes.

40:26.558 --> 40:28.158
[Meagen] Way to go!

40:30.327 --> 40:33.863
- We're gonna go to room number five.
- Number five? Got ya.

40:33.865 --> 40:37.400
<i>[Lucas] Off by one pound.
And I think that's close enough.</i>

40:38.869 --> 40:40.370
<i>I guess we're about to find out.</i>

40:56.187 --> 40:58.121
It's a good job.

40:59.423 --> 41:00.390
[knocking at door]

41:04.395 --> 41:05.962
Hello. How y'all doing?

41:05.964 --> 41:06.830
Doing good, sir.
How you doing?

41:06.832 --> 41:09.098
Good.

41:09.100 --> 41:11.267
All right, I see that
you lost some weight.

41:11.269 --> 41:13.002
Yes, sir.

41:13.004 --> 41:15.805
All right, so what kind of changes
y'all made in eating habits?

41:15.807 --> 41:18.842
Uh, we have followed
your plan, sir.

41:18.844 --> 41:21.711
We have changed our diet
down to 1,200 calories.

41:21.713 --> 41:23.780
We have it down to
400 calories per meal.

41:23.782 --> 41:28.151
Uh, we have a high
protein diet, low carb.

41:28.153 --> 41:32.422
Uh, low fats, some fruits
but not high sugary fruits.

41:37.761 --> 41:38.962
[Lucas] Right.

41:38.964 --> 41:42.398
So you need to study
the diet a little closer.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.767
To make sure
you don't eat sugary things.

41:44.769 --> 41:48.304
And as happy as I am
to see your progress.

41:48.306 --> 41:52.909
The reality is, you haven't been
sticking to just 1,200 calories.

41:52.911 --> 41:57.947
Because you would have lost
three times what you did, if you had.

41:57.949 --> 42:00.950
So, nobody in the family
is enabling you anymore?

42:00.952 --> 42:02.352
No, sir.

42:02.354 --> 42:04.521
[Meagen] We've been very strict.

42:04.523 --> 42:08.892
Like, my mom and I are both
on the same diet as Lucas, so.

42:08.894 --> 42:11.861
I feel like it helps him
to stay motivated

42:11.863 --> 42:14.631
and it also helps him
to stay disciplined.

42:14.633 --> 42:16.799
Um, and it's been challenging.

42:16.801 --> 42:18.735
But, you know what?
I'm very proud of him.

42:18.737 --> 42:21.404
And what he's accomplished
so far.

42:21.406 --> 42:24.908
Well, I'm glad to see the
progress being made by all of you.

42:24.910 --> 42:29.512
And that you all are working to
change your dynamic of household.

42:29.514 --> 42:31.614
So, how is your depression?

42:31.616 --> 42:33.850
Now that you've lost some
weight, do you feel better?

42:33.852 --> 42:36.519
I feel... Actually,
it's been pretty great.

42:36.521 --> 42:39.122
Um, I still have moments
where I struggle,

42:39.124 --> 42:40.757
but I've been feeling
a lot better overall.

42:40.759 --> 42:43.693
All right, so you're
on the right track.

42:43.695 --> 42:47.697
But the reality is, if you
did the 1,200 calorie diet

42:47.699 --> 42:49.566
then you would have lost
three times that.

42:49.568 --> 42:51.701
So, what I want you to do is,

42:51.703 --> 42:55.638
show me that you're gonna at
least stick with what you're doing now.

42:55.640 --> 42:59.709
By losing another 60 pounds
over the next two months.

42:59.711 --> 43:02.745
If you do that, then I
will know you are serious.

43:02.747 --> 43:05.114
And I will approve you
for weight loss surgery.

43:05.116 --> 43:06.783
You think you can do that?

43:06.785 --> 43:07.884
Oh, I can do that, sir.

43:07.918 --> 43:09.519
Okay. All right.

43:09.521 --> 43:12.822
I'm encouraged with your
progress. So, stick to it.

43:12.824 --> 43:15.925
And then we'll see
what we can do with you, okay?

43:15.927 --> 43:17.193
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

43:17.195 --> 43:18.661
So, we'll see you in two months.

43:18.663 --> 43:20.163
Yes, sir.

43:20.165 --> 43:21.764
If you need anything
before then, give me a call.

43:21.766 --> 43:23.399
- [both] Yes, sir.
- I will.

43:23.401 --> 43:25.268
- All right, we'll see you then.
- Yes, sir.

43:30.774 --> 43:34.043
- I told you there was nothing to worry about.
- You're right.

43:34.712 --> 43:36.245
You've done a very good job.

43:36.714 --> 43:39.215
- And we're gonna keep it up.
- Yes.

43:40.651 --> 43:44.754
I'm happy to see that Lucas
has made some progress.

43:44.756 --> 43:48.858
<i>It looks like he's taking some
initiative to turn his situation around.</i>

43:48.860 --> 43:53.429
And that's very positive,
even if it is baby steps.

43:53.431 --> 43:56.399
Now the question is,
if he's gonna stick with it.

43:56.401 --> 43:59.569
<i>Or if this was a short term
change for him.</i>

43:59.571 --> 44:05.942
But hopefully, giving him an easier goal
to start will lead to him being able to

44:05.944 --> 44:09.779
pull himself further out
of this pattern of poor health

44:09.781 --> 44:12.915
and depression
that he's been in,

44:12.917 --> 44:16.986
as he gains more self
confidence with his progress.

44:16.988 --> 44:18.221
<i>But we'll see.</i>

44:19.723 --> 44:22.291
<i>[Lucas] It was very nice
to be able to talk Dr. Now</i>

44:22.293 --> 44:26.529
<i>and to excitedly have news
over the weight loss we had.</i>

44:26.531 --> 44:31.334
<i>And it was just super exciting to talk
about the goals we achieved so far.</i>

44:32.770 --> 44:35.371
<i>It was a very encouraging
visit for me.</i>

44:35.373 --> 44:38.608
<i>I was very thrilled to hear
that he was very proud of me.</i>

44:38.610 --> 44:43.746
<i>I was actually very nervous to disappoint
him because he, kinda, feels like a coach.</i>

44:43.748 --> 44:46.482
<i>I did not want to disappoint my
coaches when I was in high school.</i>

44:46.484 --> 44:49.018
<i>And I don't want to
disappoint my coach.</i>

44:50.320 --> 44:53.256
<i>Next time I come I want to
be at least 60 pounds lighter.</i>

45:25.889 --> 45:28.424
<i>[Lucas] It's been a couple
weeks since I saw Dr. Now.</i>

45:30.828 --> 45:32.595
<i>I was really happy
that I had lost weight.</i>

45:32.597 --> 45:36.332
<i>And been successful in getting
close to my first 30 day goal.</i>

45:38.969 --> 45:42.338
<i>It felt so good to have Dr. Now
be proud of my progress.</i>

45:45.642 --> 45:48.010
<i>I don't want to disappoint him
this time.</i>

45:49.780 --> 45:51.848
<i>So lately I've been
working even harder</i>

45:51.850 --> 45:54.250
<i>to do everything
that Dr. Now says.</i>

45:56.854 --> 46:00.056
<i>But it's been
more difficult this month.</i>

46:00.058 --> 46:02.358
<i>I feel like my depression
has lessen a bit.</i>

46:03.927 --> 46:05.294
<i>Because I feel better
about myself.</i>

46:05.296 --> 46:08.664
<i>But the temptations
are stronger when they come.</i>

46:08.666 --> 46:12.368
<i>So as a defense against that, I
decided to get out of the house more.</i>

46:14.238 --> 46:16.873
<i>And find something to do
that's not here.</i>

46:16.875 --> 46:20.409
<i>So today I'm meeting, for the
first time, with a trainer at a gym.</i>

46:25.749 --> 46:27.884
Hey, you wanna go
to the gym today?

46:27.886 --> 46:30.319
-Yeah. I can take you to the gym.
-Cool.

46:31.855 --> 46:33.756
- Don't forget your socks.
- Yep

46:33.758 --> 46:36.192
- Ready when you are.
- Yeah, let's go.

46:38.428 --> 46:40.997
<i>Meagen has been supporting me
really well.</i>

46:40.999 --> 46:45.101
<i>She's trying to be more on the
same page with what I'm doing.</i>

46:45.103 --> 46:47.403
<i>And she feels she's pretty
much all the way on board.</i>

46:51.275 --> 46:53.309
[Meagen] Let me move up.

46:53.311 --> 46:56.546
<i>[Lucas] So I'm feeling confident
when I go see Dr. Now next month,</i>

46:56.548 --> 46:59.048
<i>I'm gonna be at the goal
he needs me to be at.</i>

47:00.751 --> 47:03.119
<i>And he's going to approve me
for weight loss surgery.</i>

47:13.764 --> 47:15.331
I'll see ya later, Meagen.

47:20.737 --> 47:23.372
- Hey, Kimberly.
- Are you ready to get some of that weight off?

47:24.775 --> 47:26.075
Sit down right here?

47:26.077 --> 47:29.045
- There ya go.
- Okay.

47:31.448 --> 47:32.882
[Kim] Okay. All right.

47:32.916 --> 47:34.784
- So I'm gonna do some warm-up exercises with your shoulders.
- Okay.

47:34.786 --> 47:36.419
We're gonna do some
small baby circles.

47:36.421 --> 47:38.588
- Just some small ones, we're gonna count to 20.
- Okay.

47:38.590 --> 47:40.723
All right, so, whenever you're
ready. Just stick your arms out.

47:40.725 --> 47:42.992
- All right.
- We're gonna do the baby ones first.

47:43.460 --> 47:44.727
Okay?
Just the little bitty ones.

47:44.729 --> 47:48.264
One, two, three. Tell me
when you feel the burn.

47:56.406 --> 47:59.175
18, 19, now we're gonna go
forward. Gonna do some big ones.

47:59.177 --> 48:00.509
- Okay.
- Big, one,

48:00.511 --> 48:01.777
One, two--

48:01.779 --> 48:04.847
<i>Pushing myself physically
is really hard.</i>

48:04.849 --> 48:07.016
<i>But at the same time
it feels good.</i>

48:07.018 --> 48:08.718
<i>It takes me back
to my high school days.</i>

48:08.720 --> 48:11.821
<i>When people looked up to me
for how strong I was.</i>

48:11.823 --> 48:14.790
I'm gonna try to get your arms
out in front of you, so, we'll see.

48:14.792 --> 48:16.792
There ya go.
Kinda little bit far forward.

48:16.794 --> 48:18.160
Two, go down.

48:18.729 --> 48:20.229
Okay. Three.

48:20.231 --> 48:22.064
Let's go to about right here
and keep the tension.

48:22.132 --> 48:23.332
Four.

48:24.868 --> 48:26.168
Five, just a little heavier.

48:26.670 --> 48:27.637
Feel the burn yet?

48:27.639 --> 48:29.872
- Okay, good.
- [grunts]

48:29.874 --> 48:33.309
[Kimberly] Very good. Hit
'em. All right. Good stuff.

48:45.622 --> 48:48.090
You're gonna bend
those wrists, just like this.

48:48.825 --> 48:50.226
- There you go. Up.
- [breathes heavily]

48:51.929 --> 48:53.296
Does it burn?
Good.

48:53.931 --> 48:55.331
Six, don't go too high.

49:00.871 --> 49:02.271
All right. Yeah.

49:04.408 --> 49:05.608
Feel lightheaded?

49:05.610 --> 49:07.343
- It's getting there.
- [Kimberly] Okay.

49:08.478 --> 49:10.780
All right, well,
we did a good job today.

49:10.782 --> 49:12.181
That's what it's all about,
right?

49:12.183 --> 49:13.382
We're gonna do it again.

49:13.384 --> 49:14.784
- Doing it again.
- And again and again.

49:14.786 --> 49:16.652
- [both] And again and again.
- Gonna get you a water.

49:16.654 --> 49:18.220
- I'll be right back.
- Got ya.

49:19.690 --> 49:21.324
<i>[Lucas] My first workout
in a couple of years.</i>

49:21.326 --> 49:25.728
It was tough,
but I managed to push through.

49:25.730 --> 49:29.432
<i>I feel a little bit exhilarated
and tired at the same time.</i>

49:30.667 --> 49:33.035
I would love to work
with you more

49:33.037 --> 49:34.670
and, uh, we'll see how far
we can take it.

49:34.672 --> 49:35.671
- [Lucas] Sounds great.
- You in?

49:35.673 --> 49:37.540
- Yeah.
- [Kimberly] Let's get out of here.

49:37.542 --> 49:39.775
-Okay.
<i>- Lucas did fantastic. I'm so proud of him.</i>

49:39.777 --> 49:43.412
He pushed, he showed
the want that he wants it,

49:43.414 --> 49:45.448
which is important 'cause
sometimes people wanna get lazy

49:45.450 --> 49:46.649
and they don't show the want.

49:46.651 --> 49:48.484
<i>I'm looking forward
to working with him.</i>

49:48.486 --> 49:49.618
<i>We're gonna get a couple
days in a week,</i>

49:49.620 --> 49:51.654
<i>and we're just gonna see
how far we can take it.</i>

49:51.656 --> 49:54.290
Hopefully he's gonna be in
here raising the whole house.

50:02.699 --> 50:05.434
<i>[Lucas] Today,
I'm going to see Dr. Now.</i>

50:06.503 --> 50:08.637
<i>I am very nervous about
what the scale's gonna say</i>

50:08.639 --> 50:11.540
<i>because I have encountered
many challenges.</i>

50:11.542 --> 50:15.745
<i>There were many temptations where I've
seen my family had eaten in front of me.</i>

50:15.747 --> 50:19.415
<i>Foods that I would've wanted
to eat, but I cannot eat them.</i>

50:20.550 --> 50:22.151
I've had to sit there
and say, "No."

50:22.819 --> 50:26.389
<i>I've had to do some exercises that
were kind of uncomfortable for me.</i>

50:26.391 --> 50:27.723
<i>I've had to do some walking.</i>

50:27.725 --> 50:31.093
<i>Reaching that goal
was my determination.</i>

50:36.600 --> 50:39.335
<i>I know scales don't lie,
according to Dr. Now,</i>

50:39.337 --> 50:43.906
but I worked really hard to lose the
weight and I don't wanna disappoint him.

50:43.908 --> 50:47.977
I don't wanna get any yelling
from him, so hopefully I lost enough.

50:49.379 --> 50:52.148
<i>It feels really good
to be doing well.</i>

50:53.950 --> 50:56.719
<i>And I know it would feel
awful to find out if I was way off.</i>

50:56.721 --> 50:58.054
Lucas?

51:00.657 --> 51:03.159
- [Lucas] Hello.
- Hello.

51:03.161 --> 51:05.661
<i>[Lucas] Because it would mean
I'm not learning how to do this.</i>

51:05.663 --> 51:09.665
<i>And that's the type of setback that's
really hard for me to recover from.</i>

51:09.667 --> 51:12.268
Go ahead and step on the scale
when you're ready.

51:14.571 --> 51:17.640
<i>[Lucas] I was supposed
to lose 60 pounds by today</i>

51:17.642 --> 51:22.111
<i>and if I did, I feel certain he'll
approve me for weight-loss surgery.</i>

51:37.494 --> 51:40.062
[woman] Go ahead and step
on the scale.

51:40.064 --> 51:42.665
<i>[Lucas] I'm at Dr. Now's
to see where my weight's at.</i>

51:42.667 --> 51:46.235
<i>At my last appointment,
I weighed 590 pounds.</i>

51:47.471 --> 51:50.339
<i>And Dr. Now told me
to lose 60 pounds.</i>

51:53.076 --> 51:57.179
<i>So if I did that, then I should
weigh 530 or less today.</i>

51:57.181 --> 51:58.914
<i>I'm just praying
that I did that,</i>

51:58.916 --> 52:01.250
<i>so I can get approved
for weight-loss surgery.</i>

52:09.459 --> 52:10.426
[woman] We're going
to room five.

52:10.428 --> 52:13.762
<i>[Lucas] Dang,
that's short of the mark.</i>

52:13.764 --> 52:17.633
<i>I'm still happy that I lost as much
as I did, but that's too far off for me</i>

52:17.635 --> 52:20.870
<i>to feel all the way good
about it.</i>

52:20.872 --> 52:25.975
<i>I just hope Dr. Now sees how hard I've
been working and he goes easy on me.</i>

52:27.944 --> 52:31.247
<i>But that's not good enough for
me to feel very good right now.</i>

52:35.819 --> 52:36.952
Hello, how are you all doing?

52:36.954 --> 52:39.188
Doing good, sir,
how are you doing?

52:39.489 --> 52:43.926
All right, you're down
to 539, no?

52:43.928 --> 52:47.530
- Mmm-hmm, yes, sir.
- All right, that's great, so you've lost 52 pounds.

52:47.532 --> 52:48.597
Over the last two months.

52:48.599 --> 52:51.400
- Yes, sir.
- [Dr. Now] Did you do any exercise?

52:51.402 --> 52:55.771
Yes, sir, I work out at a gym and my
trainer helps me work out two days a week.

52:55.773 --> 52:59.708
Okay, that's good,
so what is your goal weight?

52:59.710 --> 53:03.012
My goal weight
would be 200 pounds.

53:03.014 --> 53:06.782
Ah, that's too high.
Your goal weight is 167,

53:06.784 --> 53:08.184
167?

53:08.585 --> 53:10.886
Okay, then I will shoot
for that.

53:10.888 --> 53:14.390
So, that means that you gotta
have 400 pounds to lose, huh?

53:14.991 --> 53:17.860
That's gonna be awhile,
but I got it.

53:17.862 --> 53:20.729
All right, I think, realistically, the
only way you're gonna get to that

53:20.731 --> 53:23.832
is weight-loss surgery, okay?

53:23.834 --> 53:27.536
So now that you lost weight
and you stay focused,

53:27.538 --> 53:30.606
uh, I'm gonna approve you
for weight-loss surgery.

53:30.608 --> 53:33.842
So we'll go ahead
and run some testing on you.

53:33.844 --> 53:37.913
And if everything looks good,
we'll schedule you for next month.

53:37.915 --> 53:39.582
So how does that sound?

53:39.584 --> 53:40.883
- That sounds great.
- Awesome.

53:40.885 --> 53:44.820
All right, continue with your
eating habit and weight-loss

53:44.822 --> 53:48.090
and continue to lose
what you're losing right now,

53:48.092 --> 53:50.326
even tighten up
a little bit more.

53:57.367 --> 54:00.035
- Yes, sir.
- [Dr. Now] Okay.

54:00.037 --> 54:03.138
- All right, if you need anything, give me a call.
- [Lucas] Yes, sir.

54:03.140 --> 54:05.007
All right,
I'll see you all later.

54:05.009 --> 54:06.175
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

54:06.177 --> 54:07.409
[Lucas] See you later, sir.

54:14.918 --> 54:16.118
Yeah.

54:16.353 --> 54:17.386
[inhales deeply]

54:19.122 --> 54:20.389
[exhales deeply]

54:22.058 --> 54:24.059
I've been very nervous.

54:24.628 --> 54:26.295
Scared I wasn't gonna make it.

54:28.865 --> 54:32.801
I'm encouraged to see Lucas
continue to lose weight

54:32.803 --> 54:35.537
in past few month
and he has done a good job

54:35.539 --> 54:38.841
<i>in maintaining his eating
habit and doing exercise.</i>

54:38.843 --> 54:41.777
<i>So I think he's ready
for weight-loss surgery</i>

54:41.779 --> 54:43.545
<i>and I think he's going
to do well,</i>

54:43.547 --> 54:45.981
but we still have a long way
to go with him.

54:45.983 --> 54:50.452
<i>And I think the real hard work
for him will start after surgery</i>

54:50.454 --> 54:53.989
because the key
to his long-term success

54:53.991 --> 54:58.694
<i>is gonna be for him to keep working
on changing his home dynamic</i>

54:58.696 --> 55:00.963
<i>and becoming more independent.</i>

55:00.965 --> 55:03.699
And that's gonna get harder
as time goes on,

55:03.701 --> 55:07.636
<i>but for right now, he's
moving in the right direction.</i>

55:07.638 --> 55:11.440
And he's breaking out of the
unhealthy cycle he's been in.

55:11.442 --> 55:13.776
<i>He's moving
in the right direction.</i>

55:13.778 --> 55:17.880
<i>And we'll see if surgery
will help him maintain that.</i>

55:17.882 --> 55:20.416
And he's ready
for this next step.

55:21.951 --> 55:26.689
<i>[Lucas] Today I got approved for
surgery and I am very, very excited.</i>

55:26.691 --> 55:30.759
<i>I finally reached a milestone that was
probably one of my biggest milestones</i>

55:30.761 --> 55:32.728
<i>I've had in a long time.</i>

55:32.730 --> 55:37.299
It felt exciting, at the same
time it felt like a shock.

55:38.335 --> 55:41.103
<i>I did not reach the weight
that he wanted.</i>

55:41.504 --> 55:43.872
<i>I was off by seven pounds.</i>

55:43.874 --> 55:47.609
But I've shown that I'm
capable of staying on track

55:47.611 --> 55:50.112
and I'm staying focused.

55:50.114 --> 55:53.716
<i>I still have to continue losing
weight, which is what I will be doing.</i>

55:53.718 --> 55:55.517
<i>I will still be focused
on what I need to do,</i>

55:55.519 --> 55:56.985
<i>I'm not gonna go out and party,</i>

55:56.987 --> 55:59.855
<i>I'm not gonna go out and
just pig out or anything like that.</i>

55:59.857 --> 56:01.523
<i>I'm gonna continue
what I'm doing</i>

56:01.525 --> 56:03.258
<i>because this is what
I need to do.</i>

56:03.260 --> 56:05.761
<i>And I've come too far
to turn back now.</i>

56:05.763 --> 56:10.933
<i>This first goal is just the first
of many goals I want to reach.</i>

56:10.935 --> 56:12.835
<i>So even if it feels
like I finally made it,</i>

56:12.837 --> 56:15.504
<i>I know I still have
a long way to go.</i>

56:15.506 --> 56:18.874
<i>And I'm not gonna waste
any of this momentum.</i>

56:18.876 --> 56:21.910
<i>I want to build on it to be
sure I get where I wanna go.</i>

56:21.912 --> 56:24.646
<i>So I'm gonna let myself
enjoy this moment,</i>

56:24.648 --> 56:27.049
<i>but not with food
and only for a minute</i>

56:27.051 --> 56:28.884
<i>'cause then I have
to buckle down</i>

56:28.886 --> 56:32.221
<i>and get ready for weight-loss
surgery by losing some more weight.</i>

56:50.407 --> 56:53.409
I'm feeling pretty nervous
about this.

56:53.576 --> 56:56.078
But this is it.

57:02.152 --> 57:05.854
<i>Today's the day of my surgery and my
brother, Kenneth, came through to take me</i>

57:05.856 --> 57:09.958
<i>since our parents are working and
I'm grateful that he's here for me today,</i>

57:09.960 --> 57:12.394
<i>so I can share this moment
with someone,</i>

57:12.396 --> 57:14.396
<i>and so I don't have to be alone.</i>

57:22.172 --> 57:24.440
<i>I'm excited for what this day
means to me</i>

57:24.442 --> 57:29.978
<i>and I'm proud of myself for making
it this far, but I'm also a little scared</i>

57:29.980 --> 57:32.714
<i>because anytime you have
surgery, something could go wrong.</i>

57:32.716 --> 57:34.917
<i>And even though I've been
losing weight,</i>

57:34.919 --> 57:38.320
<i>Dr. Now says there's still a risk
factor because of how big I am.</i>

57:39.722 --> 57:42.157
- [Kenneth] You okay, dude?
- Yeah.

57:42.159 --> 57:44.259
[Kenneth] It's cold as hell
in here.

57:45.161 --> 57:46.428
[Lucas] Pretty cold.

57:48.565 --> 57:50.466
- [Vana] Hi.
- Hi.

57:50.468 --> 57:52.768
My name's Vana, one of
the nurses that's working here.

57:52.770 --> 57:55.537
- I'll be getting you ready for this procedure, okay?
- Okay.

57:55.539 --> 57:58.407
<i>Over the course of last week,
me and my family</i>

57:58.409 --> 58:03.011
did talk about a lot of things about this
surgery and how everybody's excited,

58:03.013 --> 58:07.216
<i>that even I should be excited that
this is a whole big change in my life.</i>

58:10.920 --> 58:12.821
- [Dr. Now] Hi, Lucas.
- Hey, Dr. Now.

58:12.823 --> 58:13.856
How are you?

58:13.858 --> 58:15.691
Today I'm doing okay.

58:15.693 --> 58:18.927
All right, are you ready
for your surgery today?

58:18.929 --> 58:21.396
- I am ready.
- So who's with you today?

58:21.398 --> 58:24.099
Today with me is my brother,
Kenneth.

58:24.200 --> 58:25.467
Nice to meet you.

58:25.469 --> 58:28.937
All right, we go ahead and
get you started in a few minutes.

58:28.939 --> 58:33.375
And surgery will be finished,
you're gonna be in the recovery room.

58:33.377 --> 58:35.878
Then after that,
we get you up on the floor.

58:35.880 --> 58:39.715
Later on today, you're gonna be
able to walk and get some liquid, okay?

58:39.717 --> 58:41.917
- Okay.
- And if everything goes okay,

58:41.919 --> 58:44.186
then maybe we send you home
tomorrow or the next day.

58:44.188 --> 58:45.954
- Okay.
- [Dr. Now] Okay.

58:45.956 --> 58:47.789
Any questions?

58:47.791 --> 58:49.324
Uh, no, I think I'm good.

58:49.326 --> 58:50.826
You're ready for it, huh?

58:50.828 --> 58:54.596
- I'm ready for it.
- All right, we'll get you fixed up shortly, okay?

58:54.598 --> 58:56.398
- Okay, thank you.
- [Dr. Now] All right.

59:09.445 --> 59:12.047
- See you on the other side.
- [Lucas] Yeah.

59:16.452 --> 59:20.656
<i>I feel very nervous, but at
the same time I'm excited.</i>

59:20.658 --> 59:25.027
I'm excited that I've reached a big
milestone in this journey that I'm on.

59:27.964 --> 59:30.165
- I'll see you.
- Okay, I'll see you later.

59:33.069 --> 59:34.403
I'm ready for this.

59:34.771 --> 59:37.172
<i>I am very ready for this.</i>

59:45.148 --> 59:46.848
<i>[Dr. Now] Today
we are attempting to perform</i>

59:46.850 --> 59:49.818
<i>a gastric sleeve procedure
on Lucas.</i>

59:49.820 --> 59:52.754
<i>Since his last appointment
a month ago,</i>

59:52.756 --> 59:55.424
<i>he has lost another 24 pounds</i>

59:55.426 --> 1:00:01.029
<i>to get down to 515, so he has
continued to make progress</i>

1:00:01.031 --> 1:00:04.132
<i>and lose weight
over the last four months.</i>

1:00:04.567 --> 1:00:05.968
In my two hands.

1:00:05.970 --> 1:00:10.472
<i>So I'm confident he ready for
a tool like weight-loss surgery</i>

1:00:10.474 --> 1:00:16.745
<i>because what this operation does
is that it reduce his stomach by 90%.</i>

1:00:16.747 --> 1:00:21.984
<i>Leaving a small, narrow tube
that looks similar to a sleeve.</i>

1:00:21.986 --> 1:00:25.420
<i>So the patient's food intake
is physically limited</i>

1:00:25.422 --> 1:00:28.190
<i>and the patient is less hungry.</i>

1:00:28.192 --> 1:00:33.695
<i>So this operation will give them an
opportunity to lose even more weight.</i>

1:00:33.697 --> 1:00:35.263
Okay.

1:00:37.967 --> 1:00:42.404
<i>But, ultimately, whether this
surgery helps Lucas for the long-term</i>

1:00:42.406 --> 1:00:47.409
<i>will be completely up to him
and the choices he makes.</i>

1:00:47.411 --> 1:00:50.679
Okay, go forward. We
can turn the room lights off.

1:00:50.681 --> 1:00:52.080
[doctor] Room lights off,
please, guys.

1:00:53.950 --> 1:00:58.320
<i>So first I'm gonna tend to fix
his hernia as best as possible.</i>

1:00:59.355 --> 1:01:01.156
[Dr. Now speaking]

1:01:03.893 --> 1:01:09.431
<i>Then I will move ahead and attempt
to do a gastric sleeve procedure on him.</i>

1:01:10.933 --> 1:01:12.667
<i>And if we are able
to complete that,</i>

1:01:12.669 --> 1:01:19.341
<i>then I will give Lucas an important
tool to help him continue to lose weight.</i>

1:01:19.343 --> 1:01:23.578
<i>So this will be a big help to keep
him on track, while we work with him</i>

1:01:23.580 --> 1:01:28.517
<i>to get him to where he's able to
maintain his progress for the long-term.</i>

1:01:28.519 --> 1:01:34.022
<i>But my concern with that is not
having enough time to do both surgeries.</i>

1:01:34.024 --> 1:01:38.527
<i>If the situation with his hernia is
too severe because at his weight,</i>

1:01:38.529 --> 1:01:40.128
<i>this is a high-risk surgery.</i>

1:01:40.130 --> 1:01:44.599
<i>And because of that, we want to
limit the time he is under anesthesia</i>

1:01:44.601 --> 1:01:50.338
<i>because it could start to put too much strain
on his system if we keep him under too long.</i>

1:01:50.340 --> 1:01:55.410
<i>So we'll have to see what's
possible to do safely with him today.</i>

1:01:55.412 --> 1:02:02.117
Okay, I finished a portion of the hernia,
so now I'm gonna complete the sleeve.

1:02:08.491 --> 1:02:12.994
All right, we are almost done
removing his stomach.

1:02:18.167 --> 1:02:24.973
Lucas is really the epitome of
resilience for us in our family.

1:02:24.975 --> 1:02:28.977
Since I've been waiting here, I have
reached out to my parents to let them know

1:02:28.979 --> 1:02:29.911
that he went into surgery.

1:02:29.913 --> 1:02:33.381
<i>My mom has actually been
really nervous,</i>

1:02:33.383 --> 1:02:35.951
<i>and I would say that my dad
has been nervous, too.</i>

1:02:35.953 --> 1:02:39.221
<i>And I've been keeping him
up to date as well.</i>

1:02:42.792 --> 1:02:44.092
[Dr. Now speaking]

1:03:07.717 --> 1:03:10.085
[Dr. Now] Okay. All finished.

1:03:16.125 --> 1:03:18.693
<i>[Dr. Now] Lucas' surgery
went very well today.</i>

1:03:18.695 --> 1:03:24.533
<i>We were able to completely perform a sleeve
gastrectomy on Lucas without any issue.</i>

1:03:24.535 --> 1:03:28.069
Fortunately, we didn't have
any issues with anesthesia

1:03:28.071 --> 1:03:32.641
<i>or any complication with his
surgery and everything went very well.</i>

1:03:32.643 --> 1:03:35.210
That's a huge lung stone.

1:03:35.212 --> 1:03:37.646
<i>Now that he has had his surgery,</i>

1:03:37.648 --> 1:03:41.883
Lucas is gonna be able to lose
weight much easier with this operation.

1:03:41.885 --> 1:03:44.653
<i>For the next month,
he will be on a liquid diet</i>

1:03:44.655 --> 1:03:49.224
<i>and in that time, he should be
able to lose another 30 pounds.</i>

1:03:49.226 --> 1:03:53.795
<i>And after that, he should lose,
at least, 20 to 25 pounds a month</i>

1:03:53.797 --> 1:03:59.234
<i>until he gets close to his target
weight, if he is staying on track.</i>

1:03:59.236 --> 1:04:03.171
<i>But now, the real work
is gonna start for Lucas.</i>

1:04:03.173 --> 1:04:07.809
<i>So far, he's been taking small
steps towards a healthier life.</i>

1:04:07.811 --> 1:04:12.681
<i>But now it is important for
him to start taking bigger steps</i>

1:04:12.683 --> 1:04:15.483
<i>if he wants to keep
his progress going</i>

1:04:15.485 --> 1:04:17.919
<i>and make it last
for the long-term.</i>

1:04:17.921 --> 1:04:23.658
<i>And that's not gonna be easy for him
because it means he's gonna have to work</i>

1:04:23.660 --> 1:04:25.861
<i>to become even more independent.</i>

1:04:25.863 --> 1:04:30.699
<i>To the point that may be uncomfortable
for him because of how much</i>

1:04:30.701 --> 1:04:33.435
<i>it will change the dynamic
he has at home</i>

1:04:33.437 --> 1:04:36.872
<i>and take him out
of what's familiar for him.</i>

1:04:36.874 --> 1:04:43.945
<i>But if he doesn't do that now, he's gonna
risk slowly falling back into old habits,</i>

1:04:43.947 --> 1:04:46.248
<i>to start going back
in the wrong direction.</i>

1:04:46.250 --> 1:04:49.451
<i>So the next few months
will be very telling</i>

1:04:49.453 --> 1:04:54.489
<i>because we will either start to
see that Lucas is going to keep going</i>

1:04:54.491 --> 1:04:59.461
<i>in the direction he needs
and start to do better and better</i>

1:04:59.463 --> 1:05:04.199
<i>or see his progress slow down
and head in the wrong direction.</i>

1:05:04.201 --> 1:05:08.303
<i>And if the latter happens,
it won't be a good sign.</i>

1:05:08.938 --> 1:05:10.138
Hi, Lucas.

1:05:11.007 --> 1:05:12.007
Hey, Dr. Now.

1:05:12.009 --> 1:05:13.775
You waking up?

1:05:13.777 --> 1:05:15.810
- Yeah.
- All right, the surgery went very well.

1:05:15.812 --> 1:05:18.780
Okay, you're in recovery room.

1:05:18.782 --> 1:05:23.685
- Awesome.
- Okay, so we're gonna get you upstairs pretty soon.

1:05:23.687 --> 1:05:26.855
And let you rest
and after four hours,

1:05:26.857 --> 1:05:28.290
we can get you up
walking around.

1:05:29.191 --> 1:05:30.625
Okay.

1:05:30.627 --> 1:05:35.697
And you get up and do some walking
and you can have some liquid, okay?

1:05:35.699 --> 1:05:38.733
- [Lucas] Thank you.
- All right, everything went very well.

1:05:38.735 --> 1:05:41.102
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

1:05:41.104 --> 1:05:42.938
All right, I'll see you later.

1:05:42.940 --> 1:05:43.638
I'll see you later, sir.

1:05:43.640 --> 1:05:46.107
Okay. Take care.

1:06:15.771 --> 1:06:18.540
<i>[Lucas] It's been about
two weeks since my surgery</i>

1:06:18.542 --> 1:06:20.241
<i>and I'm feeling pretty good.</i>

1:06:20.843 --> 1:06:22.477
<i>When I came home
from the hospital,</i>

1:06:22.479 --> 1:06:26.081
<i>I started staying
at my mom and dad's place.</i>

1:06:26.083 --> 1:06:29.918
<i>So they can keep an eye on me and
make sure I have everything I need.</i>

1:06:29.920 --> 1:06:33.188
<i>But it was only about a day
or two that I really needed help.</i>

1:06:34.724 --> 1:06:39.294
<i>And even after day one, I was able
to get up and move around some.</i>

1:06:39.296 --> 1:06:44.232
<i>The good news is ever since the surgery,
my hunger's pretty much gone away.</i>

1:06:45.334 --> 1:06:47.869
<i>But it's weird because I don't
really like eating anymore.</i>

1:06:47.871 --> 1:06:51.039
<i>And that was one of my
favorite things before surgery.</i>

1:06:52.975 --> 1:06:56.411
<i>It's like I don't know myself
or something</i>

1:06:56.413 --> 1:06:58.913
<i>or, like, being
a different person,</i>

1:06:58.915 --> 1:07:00.515
<i>but I know
that it's good for me.</i>

1:07:07.690 --> 1:07:11.393
<i>Dr. Now says I've already eaten
enough food for the next four years.</i>

1:07:11.395 --> 1:07:14.062
<i>So I guess that's enjoyment
I've already used up.</i>

1:07:15.431 --> 1:07:19.401
<i>It's been a little bit difficult because,
at first, I wasn't able to exercise</i>

1:07:19.403 --> 1:07:21.970
<i>and that's been my main thing
to do to avoid the boredom.</i>

1:07:21.972 --> 1:07:24.839
<i>But I've been able to start
playing videogames again</i>

1:07:24.841 --> 1:07:27.108
<i>and I think
it's going pretty well</i>

1:07:27.977 --> 1:07:30.145
<i>because I've only been
doing it a little bit.</i>

1:07:30.147 --> 1:07:33.548
<i>And my friends online have all been really
supportive with what I'm going through.</i>

1:07:33.550 --> 1:07:37.485
<i>And they're all real excited for
me that I got weight-loss surgery.</i>

1:07:37.487 --> 1:07:40.422
<i>My depression and anxiety
are in pretty good shape, too.</i>

1:07:41.390 --> 1:07:43.958
<i>Overall, I'm feeling
pretty positive,</i>

1:07:43.960 --> 1:07:45.960
<i>but it still feels
like something's missing.</i>

1:07:45.962 --> 1:07:48.830
<i>And I'm hoping that
that feeling goes away</i>

1:07:48.832 --> 1:07:50.965
<i>when I start eating
real food again.</i>

1:07:52.902 --> 1:07:55.003
I just hope
it gets a little easier

1:07:55.005 --> 1:07:57.238
<i>because this liquid diet
is pretty rough.</i>

1:08:11.687 --> 1:08:12.887
[Maegen] So you excited
about going

1:08:12.889 --> 1:08:15.423
to see Dr. Now today
after your surgery?

1:08:16.425 --> 1:08:19.527
I'm eager to find out
what he's gonna say today.

1:08:19.529 --> 1:08:20.462
- [Maegen] Why?
- I mainly want to know

1:08:20.464 --> 1:08:24.499
what he wants to say
about my progress.

1:08:24.501 --> 1:08:29.204
[Maegen] I'm sure he's gonna be happy with
your progress. I mean, everybody can see it.

1:08:29.605 --> 1:08:32.407
I think he'll say
that he's proud of you.

1:08:33.542 --> 1:08:35.777
<i>[Lucas] Me and Maegen are
gonna go see Dr. Now today.</i>

1:08:35.779 --> 1:08:38.513
<i>And I'm excited to see
how much weight I've lost</i>

1:08:38.515 --> 1:08:41.316
<i>because it feels like
I've lost another good bit.</i>

1:08:43.619 --> 1:08:46.087
<i>It's been two months
since my weight-loss surgery.</i>

1:08:46.089 --> 1:08:49.657
<i>The first month was hard because
being on liquids for that long</i>

1:08:49.659 --> 1:08:50.458
<i>didn't sit well with me.</i>

1:08:50.460 --> 1:08:51.993
<i>It was a big adjustment.</i>

1:08:51.995 --> 1:08:55.029
<i>The surgery made it so that
I'm never really all that hungry,</i>

1:08:55.031 --> 1:08:56.564
<i>so I never
really feel satisfied.</i>

1:08:56.566 --> 1:08:59.400
- All right, you ready?
- Yep.

1:08:59.402 --> 1:09:03.238
<i>But it's not a big deal to me because
I don't want it that much anymore.</i>

1:09:04.540 --> 1:09:08.676
<i>Now that I'm back to solid
foods, I'm getting more used to it.</i>

1:09:08.678 --> 1:09:13.214
<i>Food just isn't a big deal as it
used to be and that's all there is to it.</i>

1:09:13.216 --> 1:09:16.084
<i>So I'm trying to stay on track
and stay focused.</i>

1:09:16.719 --> 1:09:18.653
Oh, thank you.

1:09:18.655 --> 1:09:21.289
<i>I've been able to start
working out again, so that helps.</i>

1:09:21.624 --> 1:09:24.192
<i>And I set some boundaries
with my gaming,</i>

1:09:24.194 --> 1:09:26.661
<i>so I could play a little bit
and visit my old friends online,</i>

1:09:26.663 --> 1:09:29.998
<i>but not sit there all day and
definitely not eat while I'm doing it.</i>

1:09:30.000 --> 1:09:33.101
<i>And the best part is I
don't even want to do that</i>

1:09:33.103 --> 1:09:34.402
<i>because being healthy
feels good.</i>

1:09:35.704 --> 1:09:37.238
Lucas.

1:09:51.954 --> 1:09:54.222
Okay, you can go ahead
and step on the scale.

1:10:15.010 --> 1:10:17.145
- [Maegen] Way to go, Luke.
- Yay.

1:10:17.846 --> 1:10:20.582
- It's fantastic.
- Mmm-hmm.

1:10:20.584 --> 1:10:23.051
- Okay, we're gonna go to room five.
- Okay.

1:10:24.486 --> 1:10:26.754
<i>It's a little bit more
than I expected.</i>

1:10:26.756 --> 1:10:29.791
<i>Was pretty excited,
pretty stoked about it.</i>

1:10:29.793 --> 1:10:33.828
<i>But at the same time,
I'm also ready for more.</i>

1:10:33.830 --> 1:10:37.832
<i>I feel incredibly great
actually, I feel wonderful.</i>

1:10:37.834 --> 1:10:40.768
<i>I'm ready to see more drop off.</i>

1:10:40.770 --> 1:10:43.304
<i>I've been eating right,
make sure I stick to the diet,</i>

1:10:43.306 --> 1:10:46.407
<i>making sure I stick
to the routine,</i>

1:10:46.409 --> 1:10:50.044
<i>make sure I don't break way
from it, making sure I don't cheat,</i>

1:10:50.046 --> 1:10:53.014
<i>making sure I say no to
the things that I really want</i>

1:10:53.016 --> 1:10:57.051
<i>and, uh, staying active, just
doing what I can to stay active.</i>

1:11:00.656 --> 1:11:02.056
[knocking at door]

1:11:04.927 --> 1:11:07.295
- Hello, how y'all doing?
- Hey, Dr. Now.

1:11:07.930 --> 1:11:08.963
I'm good, how are you doing?

1:11:08.965 --> 1:11:11.099
- Good.
- [Lucas] Yes, yes.

1:11:11.101 --> 1:11:14.802
So, Lucas,
how are you getting along?

1:11:14.804 --> 1:11:16.938
- Doing pretty good, sir.
- [Dr. Now] Good.

1:11:16.940 --> 1:11:20.441
All right, you're down
to 469 today.

1:11:20.443 --> 1:11:22.277
Mmm-hmm.

1:11:22.279 --> 1:11:27.048
So, actually, you're 150 pounds
lighter than the first day I saw you.

1:11:27.050 --> 1:11:28.716
Yeah.

1:11:28.718 --> 1:11:29.617
[Dr. Now] So how you feel?

1:11:29.619 --> 1:11:31.853
I feel wonderful actually.

1:11:31.855 --> 1:11:35.089
- Has your depression continued to improve?
- Yes, sir.

1:11:35.091 --> 1:11:37.425
Great, are you able
to do a lot more

1:11:37.427 --> 1:11:38.660
- at this point?
- [Lucas] Yes, sir.

1:11:38.662 --> 1:11:42.196
I'm able to do a lot more
than I used to.

1:11:42.198 --> 1:11:45.833
I wasn't able to move around or
lift weights as easily as I can now.

1:11:45.835 --> 1:11:46.901
That's great.

1:11:46.903 --> 1:11:49.637
Well, you're doing good
and if you stay on track,

1:11:49.639 --> 1:11:53.408
in about three months,
probably getting 300,

1:11:53.410 --> 1:11:56.444
and that time, we're gonna take a
look and see what is the potential

1:11:56.446 --> 1:11:58.613
for getting some extra skin off.

1:11:58.615 --> 1:12:03.818
And you got this large apron of the
skin hanging in the front of your abdomen.

1:12:03.820 --> 1:12:06.621
The more weight that you lose,
the more hanging it become

1:12:06.623 --> 1:12:10.658
and sometime it become an issue
whether you're able to do exercise.

1:12:10.660 --> 1:12:13.361
And if that start
being a problem,

1:12:13.363 --> 1:12:18.566
then we'll look into the possibility
of doing extra skin removal, okay?

1:12:18.568 --> 1:12:21.903
- Okay.
- And a year from now, you're gonna be 200 pounds

1:12:21.905 --> 1:12:25.840
and much lighter,
so how life is gonna change

1:12:25.842 --> 1:12:29.344
from being a 600 plus pound
to 200?

1:12:29.346 --> 1:12:31.879
Life is gonna
be drastically different.

1:12:31.881 --> 1:12:34.882
- Completely different.
- It's gonna be, I mean, amazingly different.

1:12:34.884 --> 1:12:37.118
I can't wait.
I really can't wait.

1:12:37.120 --> 1:12:38.653
So what is your goal
in your life?

1:12:38.655 --> 1:12:43.658
My goal is I just wanna
be able to get a job,

1:12:43.660 --> 1:12:47.628
I wanna be able to move out of my
family's house and get on my own,

1:12:47.630 --> 1:12:50.565
I wanna be able to travel, I
wanna be able to do a lot of things.

1:12:50.567 --> 1:12:53.000
I wanna travel
for the most part.

1:12:53.002 --> 1:12:55.670
I really wanna get out, do
a bit more than I used to.

1:12:55.672 --> 1:12:59.874
And lately, I may have got the motivation
to go back and check out some colleges

1:12:59.876 --> 1:13:02.110
to see about going back
to school.

1:13:02.112 --> 1:13:05.079
And hopefully be able
to get a job and move out.

1:13:05.081 --> 1:13:11.452
Well, that'd be good. You have to pursue
your dreams and be the best you can be.

1:13:11.454 --> 1:13:12.754
- Yes, sir.
- [Dr. Now] Okay.

1:13:12.756 --> 1:13:16.591
Well, keep it up and you'll
be able to do all of that soon.

1:13:16.593 --> 1:13:18.059
I'm looking forward
to that, too.

1:13:18.061 --> 1:13:21.763
-I am, too. I think we all are.
-Yeah. [laughs]

1:13:21.765 --> 1:13:22.563
Well, I'm proud of your progress

1:13:22.565 --> 1:13:24.699
and your family supporting you.

1:13:24.701 --> 1:13:28.870
And I'm sure within a year, we're
gonna get you under 200 pounds.

1:13:28.872 --> 1:13:30.838
- All right, I look forward to it.
- [Dr. Now] Okay?

1:13:30.840 --> 1:13:31.773
All right, you all take care.

1:13:31.775 --> 1:13:33.207
You take care, sir.

1:13:38.714 --> 1:13:40.615
[Maegen] Told you
he said he was gonna be proud.

1:13:40.617 --> 1:13:42.750
- Yeah.
- We just keep it up.

1:13:42.752 --> 1:13:46.721
And don't let, you know,
depression sink in, okay?

1:13:46.723 --> 1:13:48.556
- Yeah.
- [Maegen] You do have your support group.

1:13:48.558 --> 1:13:51.025
You have a very good
support group.

1:13:51.027 --> 1:13:53.661
And we're gonna be with
you every step of the way.

1:13:53.663 --> 1:13:56.531
Thank you. I appreciate it.

1:13:56.533 --> 1:14:00.535
So far, I'm encouraged
by what I see from Lucas.

1:14:00.537 --> 1:14:04.839
<i>His recent progress could
be a little better, but overall,</i>

1:14:04.841 --> 1:14:08.142
he's staying on track and still
moving in the right direction.

1:14:08.144 --> 1:14:09.710
<i>And surely, he's committed</i>

1:14:09.712 --> 1:14:11.879
<i>to doing what he needs</i>

1:14:11.881 --> 1:14:16.184
and to taking the bigger step that
move him out of his comfort zone.

1:14:16.186 --> 1:14:17.885
<i>So I'm very proud of him</i>

1:14:17.920 --> 1:14:23.124
<i>and I'm also proud of his family for
the support that they are giving him.</i>

1:14:23.126 --> 1:14:25.693
<i>They seem to be doing
all they can</i>

1:14:25.695 --> 1:14:28.496
<i>to help change the dynamic
they have with him for the better</i>

1:14:28.498 --> 1:14:30.932
so he can live a healthier life.

1:14:30.934 --> 1:14:34.869
<i>So the vicious cycle he's been
living under seems to be broken.</i>

1:14:34.871 --> 1:14:37.338
And I think, with the momentum
he has now,

1:14:37.340 --> 1:14:42.243
<i>he's gonna keep doing more and
more to achieve all the goals he wants</i>

1:14:42.245 --> 1:14:46.681
<i>and stick to it for the long-term
so he can live a healthy life</i>

1:14:46.683 --> 1:14:49.584
<i>where he's able to pursue his
dreams and the things he wants.</i>

1:14:49.586 --> 1:14:52.587
And I'm very proud
of him for that,

1:14:52.589 --> 1:14:57.992
<i>and I'm excited to see what he
accomplishes going forward from here.</i>

1:14:58.360 --> 1:15:00.862
<i>[Lucas] Now that I'm in it
to this point,</i>

1:15:00.864 --> 1:15:04.232
<i>it's like the things that I had as
goals, I'm ready to start doing them.</i>

1:15:04.234 --> 1:15:05.399
<i>It's time.</i>

1:15:05.401 --> 1:15:07.568
<i>It's time to start living
the life I want,</i>

1:15:07.570 --> 1:15:10.137
<i>and I'm really excited
to make that happen.</i>

1:15:10.939 --> 1:15:14.242
<i>I made some big changes
but that's just the beginning.</i>

1:15:14.610 --> 1:15:16.844
<i>I am just getting started.</i>

1:15:16.846 --> 1:15:19.313
<i>These next few months
are gonna be big.</i>

1:15:35.430 --> 1:15:37.698
<i>[Lucas] Today, I'm going
to a local community college</i>

1:15:37.700 --> 1:15:39.667
<i>to see what kind of offerings
they have for me</i>

1:15:39.669 --> 1:15:41.802
<i>and to plan the next steps
that I want to take</i>

1:15:41.804 --> 1:15:44.739
<i>to start building the career
that I've always wanted to have</i>

1:15:44.741 --> 1:15:48.976
<i>but never could because I was
too big and I couldn't get around.</i>

1:15:48.978 --> 1:15:50.478
- [Lucas] Hello.
- [receptionist] How are you?

1:15:50.480 --> 1:15:51.445
[Lucas] Doing good.

1:15:51.447 --> 1:15:52.647
[receptionist] What can I do
for you today?

1:15:52.649 --> 1:15:54.549
- [Lucas] I'm here to see an advisor.
- [receptionist] Okay.

1:15:54.551 --> 1:15:56.183
<i>[Lucas] I've always liked
working on computers.</i>

1:15:56.185 --> 1:15:58.786
<i>I always did pretty well
in school, too.</i>

1:15:58.788 --> 1:16:03.190
<i>The only thing that kept me back from
pursuing a career like this was my weight.</i>

1:16:03.592 --> 1:16:06.394
<i>So now that I'm getting
that under control,</i>

1:16:06.396 --> 1:16:09.597
<i>it feels like that I'm finally
getting a shot to redo the stuff</i>

1:16:09.599 --> 1:16:11.832
<i>that I messed up because
of my eating habits.</i>

1:16:11.834 --> 1:16:13.801
[receptionist] They'll be
up here in just a moment.

1:16:13.803 --> 1:16:15.136
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1:16:18.674 --> 1:16:19.974
- Lucas?
- Yes, sir.

1:16:19.976 --> 1:16:22.777
How're you doing, Lucas? My
name is Brett, I'm an advisor here.

1:16:22.779 --> 1:16:23.811
[Lucas] Nice to meet you.

1:16:23.813 --> 1:16:26.247
- You wanna come and talk about classes?
- Sure.

1:16:33.589 --> 1:16:35.056
[Lucas] How is your day
today, Brett?

1:16:35.058 --> 1:16:36.791
[Brett] I'm doing all right,
how are you doing?

1:16:36.793 --> 1:16:37.892
[Lucas] Doing pretty good.

1:16:37.894 --> 1:16:39.093
[Brett] Yeah?

1:16:39.161 --> 1:16:41.128
[Lucas]

1:16:48.804 --> 1:16:51.806
<i>Part of the time,
I felt like my life was over.</i>

1:16:51.808 --> 1:16:53.908
<i>But all it took was the love
and support of my family,</i>

1:16:53.910 --> 1:16:57.411
<i>Dr. Now's help,
and some hard work.</i>

1:16:57.413 --> 1:16:59.280
<i>And it feels like, now,
I've got my life back.</i>

1:17:00.449 --> 1:17:02.116
<i>And I'm so happy for that.</i>

1:17:02.784 --> 1:17:05.219
<i>I wouldn't wish being
that size on anybody,</i>

1:17:05.221 --> 1:17:07.822
<i>and I never want to go back
to being like that.</i>

1:17:07.824 --> 1:17:10.691
<i>But I do know that my experience
as a 600-pound individual</i>

1:17:10.693 --> 1:17:15.963
<i>definitely makes it easier for me
to be grateful for the life that I have.</i>

1:17:15.965 --> 1:17:18.799
<i>And never again will I let myself
forget how it felt to be hopeless.</i>

1:17:18.801 --> 1:17:20.768
All right, class is over.

1:17:20.770 --> 1:17:22.770
<i>[Lucas] Because that's
always going to remind me</i>

1:17:22.772 --> 1:17:25.072
<i>to be grateful for the life
that I have.</i>

1:17:26.074 --> 1:17:28.943
<i>And now, I'm ready
to start giving back.</i>

1:17:41.556 --> 1:17:42.823
Hey, Kimberly.

1:17:42.825 --> 1:17:44.992
What's up, Lucas?
It's so good to see you.

1:17:44.994 --> 1:17:45.926
How are you feeling?

1:17:45.928 --> 1:17:47.495
Uh, I'm doing pretty good.

1:17:47.497 --> 1:17:48.796
Your shorts about
to fall off of you.

1:17:48.798 --> 1:17:50.798
- My shorts are fixing to fall off.
- [Kim] That's awesome.

1:17:50.800 --> 1:17:53.100
- That's the whole point, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1:17:54.136 --> 1:17:55.770
Let's just start today
with a little bit of lifting.

1:17:55.772 --> 1:17:57.271
Okay.

1:17:58.340 --> 1:18:01.075
<i>The other day,
I had a bit of a setback.</i>

1:18:01.077 --> 1:18:03.644
<i>Not with my eating. I still
haven't wanted to eat that much.</i>

1:18:03.646 --> 1:18:05.413
<i>It was with my video gaming.</i>

1:18:05.415 --> 1:18:07.715
<i>I was on a mission
with some of my friends.</i>

1:18:07.717 --> 1:18:10.718
<i>And it turned into a really
long quest doing some raiding.</i>

1:18:10.720 --> 1:18:13.354
<i>And I forgot about something
I promised Maegen I would do.</i>

1:18:13.356 --> 1:18:15.623
<i>And she got really upset,
and rightfully so.</i>

1:18:15.625 --> 1:18:19.393
<i>And it was the first time in a
long time that I really messed up.</i>

1:18:19.395 --> 1:18:22.863
<i>And my behavior had a negative
effect on someone I cared about</i>

1:18:22.865 --> 1:18:26.834
<i>because I was playing so long
and I lost track of time.</i>

1:18:26.836 --> 1:18:27.668
So over here, we'll do some
ball slams real quick.

1:18:27.670 --> 1:18:29.270
Okay.

1:18:33.008 --> 1:18:35.409
<i>It made me think about
going back to the way I was.</i>

1:18:35.711 --> 1:18:37.378
<i>And it really scared me.</i>

1:18:38.346 --> 1:18:42.016
<i>So today, I'm gonna work out
extra hard with my trainer.</i>

1:18:42.018 --> 1:18:44.351
<i>Because I need to feel like I'm
in control of my journey again.</i>

1:18:46.121 --> 1:18:48.322
[Kim] Control your breathing,
and we're gonna shoot it back up.

1:18:52.094 --> 1:18:54.495
Perfect. All right, you know
what to do with that bad boy.

1:18:54.497 --> 1:18:55.996
Okay.

1:18:55.998 --> 1:18:58.265
Control your breathing and
just stay leaning forward, okay?

1:18:58.267 --> 1:18:59.800
- Okay.
- There you go.

1:18:59.802 --> 1:19:02.703
<i>[Lucas] I still have way too much to
accomplish and far too much to do.</i>

1:19:02.705 --> 1:19:06.607
<i>And I need to prove to myself
all this is not just temporary.</i>

1:19:06.609 --> 1:19:09.176
<i>But I'm making
permanent changes to my life</i>

1:19:09.178 --> 1:19:11.412
<i>that's gonna last me
till I grow old.</i>

1:19:12.681 --> 1:19:13.981
[Kim] Very good.

1:19:15.917 --> 1:19:17.618
You ready to do some triceps.

1:19:17.620 --> 1:19:19.420
- Yes, I'm ready.
- All right, let's get it.

1:19:19.422 --> 1:19:21.889
<i>[Lucas] I gotta remember
that this is a process.</i>

1:19:21.891 --> 1:19:24.658
<i>It's not like flipping
a switch that always stays on.</i>

1:19:24.660 --> 1:19:26.427
<i>I'm gonna have to work at it.</i>

1:19:27.429 --> 1:19:29.597
<i>When you've lost
175 pounds or more,</i>

1:19:29.599 --> 1:19:32.967
<i>you want to celebrate,
you want to relax.</i>

1:19:33.802 --> 1:19:38.005
<i>And then you remember, "Oh, I
still have more than 250 to lose."</i>

1:19:38.007 --> 1:19:40.307
<i>And it's like,
"Man, I gotta keep going."</i>

1:19:40.542 --> 1:19:41.975
Four, there you go.

1:19:41.977 --> 1:19:44.745
<i>[Lucas] So it might be a slow
pace because it's a marathon.</i>

1:19:44.747 --> 1:19:47.581
<i>But there's no slowing down
and there's no stopping.</i>

1:19:47.583 --> 1:19:48.515
[Kim] Perfect. Eight, come on.

1:19:48.517 --> 1:19:50.818
<i>[Lucas] Surgery
was just the beginning.</i>

1:19:50.820 --> 1:19:54.722
<i>And no matter how well I've done
so far, I still have a long way to go.</i>

1:19:54.724 --> 1:19:55.823
- [exhales] Okay.
- Very good.

1:19:55.825 --> 1:19:57.658
- Great job. Great job.
- Yeah. Thank you.

1:19:57.660 --> 1:19:58.626
You didn't lose
too much strength.

1:19:58.628 --> 1:19:59.860
I mean, everything looks good.

1:19:59.862 --> 1:20:00.994
- You feel good? Okay.
- I feel good.

1:20:00.996 --> 1:20:02.897
I also was worried about
if I was losing my muscle.

1:20:02.899 --> 1:20:04.899
- I don't wanna lose my muscle.
- We're gonna get started back next Tuesday.

1:20:04.901 --> 1:20:06.901
- So I'm all ready for it.
- Nice.

1:20:06.903 --> 1:20:09.470
- Amazing. I love you, man.
- Love you, too.

1:20:09.472 --> 1:20:12.139
- We'll see you next week.
- Okay.

1:20:12.141 --> 1:20:14.675
<i>[Lucas] Today was a really good
day to come back and work out.</i>

1:20:14.677 --> 1:20:18.245
<i>Starting next week, I'll be coming back
to the gym two to three times a week.</i>

1:20:18.247 --> 1:20:21.315
That way I can get fit and have
my life... Get my life back together.

1:20:26.621 --> 1:20:28.055
Okay.

1:20:58.486 --> 1:21:00.654
<i>[Lucas] It hasn't even
been a year yet</i>

1:21:00.656 --> 1:21:03.324
<i>and it's awesome to see
how much my life has changed.</i>

1:21:08.864 --> 1:21:11.632
<i>My sister has been hiring
a baby sitter</i>

1:21:11.634 --> 1:21:14.201
<i>and that has freed me up
to get my own real job,</i>

1:21:14.203 --> 1:21:16.003
<i>and I'm really enjoying that.</i>

1:21:26.014 --> 1:21:27.514
Hey, John. I'm here, man.

1:21:27.516 --> 1:21:29.083
Hey, good morning.

1:21:35.724 --> 1:21:38.893
Hey, so what we got,
this one came in Sunday.

1:21:38.895 --> 1:21:41.729
It's, uh... It's having issues
<i>with Halo, the new one.</i>

1:21:41.731 --> 1:21:43.597
So we're gonna swap out
some video cards.

1:21:43.599 --> 1:21:45.399
- Okay.
- And see if that fixes the problem.

1:21:45.401 --> 1:21:47.668
- Got you.
- You need any help, you just let me know.

1:21:47.670 --> 1:21:49.503
- Got you, so you want me to start with the 8 gig first?
- Yes.

1:21:49.505 --> 1:21:51.071
Okay, yeah. I can do that.

1:21:53.608 --> 1:21:56.143
<i>[Lucas] Lately,
I've been feeling great.</i>

1:21:56.745 --> 1:21:59.346
<i>I make a big effort
to find time for myself.</i>

1:22:00.248 --> 1:22:03.417
<i>And even though I'm still
living at the homestead,</i>

1:22:03.419 --> 1:22:07.755
<i>I'm still making sure I protect my
time and space and keep it for myself,</i>

1:22:07.757 --> 1:22:12.026
<i>so that I can keep making the
steps that I need to be healthy.</i>

1:22:15.931 --> 1:22:18.299
<i>And I haven't been feeling
depressed nearly as much.</i>

1:22:19.935 --> 1:22:22.236
<i>I struggle some,
but it's a lot better now.</i>

1:22:24.306 --> 1:22:26.707
<i>Dr. Now says that if
I keep losing weight,</i>

1:22:26.709 --> 1:22:30.377
<i>when I get in the 300s, I should
be able to get skin surgery.</i>

1:22:30.379 --> 1:22:32.880
<i>And that'll take
a lot of weight off, too.</i>

1:22:32.882 --> 1:22:36.083
<i>And he hopes that I'll get
there in the next few months.</i>

1:22:37.252 --> 1:22:38.919
<i>Then after that,
if I keep losing,</i>

1:22:39.387 --> 1:22:43.724
<i>he says my target weight should be
within reach within the next year or so,</i>

1:22:43.726 --> 1:22:46.961
<i>as long as I keep everything
going in the right direction.</i>

1:22:48.129 --> 1:22:50.397
<i>And that sounds
just incredible to me</i>

1:22:50.399 --> 1:22:54.034
<i>when I think about on how I
used to be not that long ago.</i>

1:22:55.804 --> 1:22:57.571
All right, John,
I got the 8 gig in there.

1:22:57.573 --> 1:22:58.505
[John] Okay.

1:22:58.507 --> 1:23:00.975
[Lucas] And I'm gonna
go out to lunch.

1:23:00.977 --> 1:23:02.743
Okay, great. I'll call the
customer to come pick it up.

1:23:02.745 --> 1:23:04.345
[Lucas] All right, cool.

1:23:15.457 --> 1:23:17.458
<i>You know, my dad doesn't like
the video games I play</i>

1:23:17.460 --> 1:23:20.728
<i>because of the way you die
and come back to life.</i>

1:23:20.730 --> 1:23:23.230
<i>He says that's not right
because that's not the way it is.</i>

1:23:24.733 --> 1:23:27.134
<i>And I used to think he was
just being old-fashioned.</i>

1:23:27.836 --> 1:23:29.636
<i>But since I've been
on this journey,</i>

1:23:29.638 --> 1:23:31.338
<i>I kind of know what
he means now.</i>

1:23:32.774 --> 1:23:36.310
<i>Because when I was 600 pounds,
it was like I was almost dead.</i>

1:23:37.846 --> 1:23:39.446
<i>And now that I got my life back,</i>

1:23:39.448 --> 1:23:41.949
<i>I can see
just how precious it is</i>

1:23:41.951 --> 1:23:46.020
<i>and how my dad might think that
dying over and over in a video game</i>

1:23:46.022 --> 1:23:49.056
<i>is the wrong idea to send
about how important life is.</i>

1:23:51.626 --> 1:23:53.293
<i>I still disagree about
the gaming.</i>

1:23:54.396 --> 1:23:56.163
<i>But I can see
his perspective more now.</i>

1:23:58.566 --> 1:24:00.334
I had a good,
productive morning at work.

1:24:00.336 --> 1:24:05.005
And right now, I'm on my way
to the park to have lunch.

1:24:06.508 --> 1:24:11.612
<i>A morning of work and lunch at
the park was not possible a year ago.</i>

1:24:11.614 --> 1:24:14.381
<i>I really like the fact that I can
be outside and mobile now.</i>

1:24:18.787 --> 1:24:21.488
<i>Now that I'm out in the world
and I joined the workforce,</i>

1:24:21.490 --> 1:24:24.391
<i>I might be too tired to get
out of bed some mornings.</i>

1:24:26.995 --> 1:24:30.831
<i>But I remember what it was like
when I had no job and no hope.</i>

1:24:30.833 --> 1:24:33.500
<i>And then I'm up and going
and ready to face the day</i>

1:24:33.502 --> 1:24:36.103
<i>because I got a whole future
ahead of me now.</i>

1:24:43.445 --> 1:24:46.246
<i>I'm not just facing one day,
I'm facing all of them.</i>

1:24:48.416 --> 1:24:51.552
<i>Even the days when the sun
is not so shiny and bright,</i>

1:24:51.554 --> 1:24:55.355
<i>I'm okay with it because I'm
alive and I'm so grateful for that.</i>

1:24:56.491 --> 1:24:59.059
<i>And now that I can,
I want to do it all.</i>

1:24:59.761 --> 1:25:02.396
<i>I want to travel
and see the world a bit.</i>

1:25:03.865 --> 1:25:07.034
<i>And I wanna go to South Korea
where the technology is great.</i>

1:25:08.903 --> 1:25:12.372
<i>I wanna meet new people, and date,
and maybe have a family of my own.</i>

1:25:13.575 --> 1:25:16.143
<i>I know that it won't all be easy</i>

1:25:16.145 --> 1:25:19.146
<i>and some days, it will be harder
to face my demons than others.</i>

1:25:20.248 --> 1:25:22.082
<i>But now that I made it this far,</i>

1:25:22.084 --> 1:25:24.918
<i>I feel ready to take on
just about anything.</i>
