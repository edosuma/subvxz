that was here.

00:22.323 --> 00:24.225
- Talk to her. She's the one
that brought it to me.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.726
- Who are you?
- I'm just an assistant.

00:25.759 --> 00:27.395
- No.

00:27.428 --> 00:30.131
- My reign is coming
to a premature end.

00:30.164 --> 00:31.165
I want your boss
to replace me.

00:31.199 --> 00:32.733
- And what's the price?

00:32.766 --> 00:35.069
- I want at least a level three
job in the Authority.

00:35.103 --> 00:37.438

that he's at a labor camp.

Searched all night.

No cameras or mics.

You're a lifesaver.

into that room

02:50.504 --> 02:51.805
while you were on
the computer--

02:51.839 --> 02:53.607

Bram's name...

02:57.778 --> 03:00.648
- Shit.
- Unknown file format?

03:00.681 --> 03:02.583
- I guess you can only open it
on an Occupation computer.

information on--

03:04.485 --> 03:07.455
on where Bram's being held or--
or how long?

It's okay.

I'll take it to work.
Try to open it there.

was a viper pit.

Can't stay here.

04:37.378 --> 04:39.079
Think he gives a shit about us?

04:39.112 --> 04:40.548
Then where the hell is he?

04:40.581 --> 04:43.551
- You know where.
- No, I don't.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.819
And neither do you.

- Guys, we're getting close
to something here.

Have a little faith.

won't cure.

Do you know what happened
to her?

That's what I heard.

If they found out
I broke the rules, it's just--

You know me.
I'm on your side.

conspiring about?

08:44.992 --> 08:47.127

08:47.160 --> 08:50.197
through the new
system procedures.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.099
- Why would you be doing that?

08:52.132 --> 08:55.335
Agent Bowman isn't authorized
to use the computer system.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.005
- How in the hell
am I supposed to do my job?

08:58.038 --> 08:59.239
- If you want something,
you put in a request

08:59.272 --> 09:00.941
through the proper channels.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.276
- That's not a very efficient
way to run a department.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.078
- But it is a secure way.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.915
And it allows everyone
to focus on their job.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.651
You, for example,
are a bloodhound.

09:10.684 --> 09:13.787

a dog to use a computer.

He's...collapsed.
Got sores all over his face.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.304
- I have to get him
to a hospital.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.072
- You can't do that.
You can't do that.

10:39.106 --> 10:42.876

that LA's Deputy Proxy

11:14.007 --> 11:15.008

11:15.042 --> 11:16.877

do we owe the pleasure?

11:39.166 --> 11:41.769

a routine inspection.

11:41.802 --> 11:46.273
Want to make sure things
are running smoothly.

11:46.306 --> 11:48.308

to see her nephew.

His name is Bram.

drive you over.

- He doesn't have a mother?

14:07.147 --> 14:11.418
Oh, by the way,
I had your friend transferred.

14:11.451 --> 14:14.154
Betsy, right?

14:14.187 --> 14:16.990
Thank you for calling her out
to me.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.425
- Calling her out?

14:18.458 --> 14:20.393
- "Order and duty."

14:20.427 --> 14:23.931
When Betsy decided the rules
didn't apply to her,

14:23.964 --> 14:27.567
she identified herself
as a problem.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.402
I owe you for that one.

[indistinct radio chatter]

14:47.320 --> 14:48.288
- What's wrong?

14:48.321 --> 14:49.556
- Broussard.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.091
One of his cell
came knocking on my door,

14:51.124 --> 14:53.160
asking for help.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.461
- And you told him
you were done.

14:54.494 --> 14:57.030
- It's not that.
One of them's sick.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.199
Will, he's really,
really sick.

14:59.232 --> 15:00.467
- That's not your problem.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.303
- It is if they take him
to a hospital.

15:03.336 --> 15:04.471
- Broussard's not that dumb.

15:04.504 --> 15:05.472
- Broussard isn't there.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.640
It's just the kids.

15:07.674 --> 15:10.610
And I'm scared about
what they're gonna do.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.212
- The Occupation is watching us.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.947
And my new partner
is up my ass.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.648
One wrong move--
- I know.

15:15.682 --> 15:19.186
Will,
if we don't step in,

15:19.219 --> 15:20.353
they will get caught.

15:20.387 --> 15:23.656

15:23.690 --> 15:25.592
We will get caught.

15:43.610 --> 15:44.011
.

15:44.044 --> 15:44.344
- Go ahead.

15:45.478 --> 15:47.180
Help yourself.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.715
I'm sure it's not easy
to get the good stuff

15:48.748 --> 15:51.151
all the way out here.

15:51.184 --> 15:52.619
- I'm on the clock.

15:52.652 --> 15:54.621
And...

15:54.654 --> 15:58.725
you know how seriously
I take my job.

15:58.758 --> 16:02.629
- You don't blame me for
your current situation, do you?

16:02.662 --> 16:06.166
- Remember who set you up in
that cushy new office of yours?

16:06.199 --> 16:09.069
You and Alcala,
you made promises.

16:10.670 --> 16:12.605
- And I kept them.

16:12.639 --> 16:15.108
They were lined up
around the bloc to bury you

16:15.142 --> 16:18.378
and I talked them out of it.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.580
So maybe you want to show
some gratitude, huh?

16:24.217 --> 16:25.218
Hm?

16:25.252 --> 16:27.520
- You're right.

16:27.554 --> 16:31.191
So...what can I do
for the Deputy Proxy?

16:31.224 --> 16:33.193
- [chuckles]

16:33.226 --> 16:37.197
Well, this place is critical
to the success of the Colony.

16:37.230 --> 16:41.401
I just wanted to see
how things...worked.

16:41.434 --> 16:43.070
- [soft chuckle]

16:43.103 --> 16:44.804
Uh, we both know you didn't
come all this way

16:44.837 --> 16:47.674
to inspect the latrines.

16:47.707 --> 16:51.278
- Well, there is
a special shipment

16:51.311 --> 16:53.646
coming through your camp.

16:53.680 --> 16:56.316
It's headed off-planet.

16:59.452 --> 17:02.322
- I think I might know the one.

17:02.355 --> 17:06.226
But there are some very serious
rules about who's allowed

17:06.259 --> 17:10.530
to inspect shipments
from the Global Authority.

17:10.563 --> 17:12.832
- In my experience,
friends sometimes

17:12.865 --> 17:15.368
bend those rules
for other friends.

17:21.241 --> 17:23.776
We are friends...

17:23.810 --> 17:25.478
right, Alan?

17:30.650 --> 17:32.452
- BB, report
to the loading dock

17:32.485 --> 17:35.155
in five minutes
for an off-load.

17:35.188 --> 17:38.191
BB, report to the loading dock
in five minutes

17:38.225 --> 17:39.526
for an off-load.

17:42.629 --> 17:44.397
- I saw Snyder coming out
of a warehouse

17:44.431 --> 17:47.600
on the other side
of the loading dock.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.469
I think that's where
they're keeping the shipment.

17:49.502 --> 17:50.870
- Yeah, we know.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.173
- We think he uses
a keycard to access it.

17:53.206 --> 17:55.175
Have you seen one
around his office?

17:55.208 --> 17:57.144
- 6149!

17:57.177 --> 17:58.411
Let's go!

18:00.513 --> 18:02.415
That wasn't a request!

What is it?

18:19.666 --> 18:20.833
- It's nothing.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.635
- What the hell happened
to you, Bram?

18:22.669 --> 18:24.137
- It's nothing.
It's a loading dock accident.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.905
I'm fine, okay?

18:25.938 --> 18:29.142
- [sighs]
I brought you something.

18:31.278 --> 18:32.612
Here, take it.

18:32.645 --> 18:36.283
[gentle music]

18:36.316 --> 18:38.251
- What am I supposed
to do with this?

18:38.285 --> 18:39.786
- I-I figured the food
wasn't so good.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.788
I thought it would help.
- You want to help?

18:41.821 --> 18:45.258
Then get me out of here.

18:45.292 --> 18:48.595
- [sighs]
It's not that simple.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.897
Hey,
hey-hey-hey-hey,

18:50.930 --> 18:54.667
it's good news about Charlie,
right?

18:54.701 --> 18:55.935
You didn't hear?

18:55.968 --> 18:57.404
- I've been a little out
of the loop.

18:57.437 --> 18:58.671
- He's home.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.173
Your dad found him
in Santa Monica

19:00.207 --> 19:01.374
and brought him back.

19:01.408 --> 19:08.415

19:09.749 --> 19:11.618
- Do Mom and Dad
know where I am?

19:11.651 --> 19:13.220
- Yeah.
Yeah.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.522
- Then why haven't
they done anything?

19:18.425 --> 19:20.727
- There are rules, Bram.

19:20.760 --> 19:24.397
We are trying.
I promise you.

19:24.431 --> 19:27.300
You won't be here much longer.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.668
- Right.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.939
- Bram.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.525
- [knocks on door]

20:00.767 --> 20:02.001
- Will?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.836

I need to talk to you.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.473

20:06.506 --> 20:07.607

20:07.640 --> 20:09.576

20:14.747 --> 20:17.817
- This is the Green Zone.
You can't just barge in here.

20:17.850 --> 20:19.486
- I need you
to take a ride with me.

20:19.519 --> 20:22.389
- [scoffs]
And why would I do that?

20:22.422 --> 20:23.856
- Look, Doc,

20:23.890 --> 20:26.025
our boys played Little League
together,

20:26.058 --> 20:28.528
which is the only reason
I didn't come with an APC

20:28.561 --> 20:30.397
and an assault team,
break your door down,

20:30.430 --> 20:32.632
and have them drag you out
of here in front of your family.

20:32.665 --> 20:35.902
[children laughing]

20:35.935 --> 20:38.971
I did you a favor today.
Why don't you do me one?

20:42.775 --> 20:44.010
- All right.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.912
- Grab your medical bag.

20:45.945 --> 20:47.414
- My medical bag?

Step across.

- He's a doctor.

21:24.817 --> 21:26.353
- Can we trust him?

21:26.386 --> 21:27.887
- We can trust him
to want to keep his good job

21:27.920 --> 21:28.888
and his Green Zone house.

21:28.921 --> 21:30.490
- What the hell is this?

Take it easy, Doc.

21:40.633 --> 21:43.370
You're just here
to see a patient.

21:43.403 --> 21:46.473
If I cut you loose,
you're gonna behave yourself?

- Bad.

- How bad?

22:27.013 --> 22:28.515
- Critical.

22:28.548 --> 22:31.718
He has high fever,
tachycardia, hemoptysis.

22:31.751 --> 22:32.785
- Why?
What's wrong with him?

22:32.819 --> 22:34.887
- How the hell should I know?

22:34.921 --> 22:37.390
- [sighs]

- Look, it doesn't seem like any
of you are presenting symptoms,

22:40.893 --> 22:44.631
which excludes any pathogen,
but without lab tests,

22:44.664 --> 22:47.600
there's no way to tell
whether this is food poisoning

22:47.634 --> 22:49.602
or esophageal cancer

22:49.636 --> 22:52.439
or one of a thousand
possibilities in between.

22:52.472 --> 22:53.940
- How do we treat him?

22:53.973 --> 22:56.409
- You get him to a hospital.
- We could take him.

the hospital staff

22:58.010 --> 22:59.512

There's no way.

what to tell you.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.415

He needs your help.

If we could get back there,
then maybe.

23:09.656 --> 23:11.524

Let's try that.

by having you two up there.

but sure as hell
looks to me like

28:35.014 --> 28:37.383
he's been exposed to radiation.

28:37.416 --> 28:38.951
- Radiation?

28:38.985 --> 28:40.319
When would he have been exposed
to radiation?

28:40.352 --> 28:42.989
- That's exactly my question.

28:43.022 --> 28:46.025
Have you been trying to build
some sort of dirty bomb?

28:46.058 --> 28:47.760
- No.
Of course not.

28:47.794 --> 28:49.261
- Well, whatever it is
you've been working on,

28:49.295 --> 28:50.897
I suggest you stop,

28:50.930 --> 28:52.364
before you all end up like him.

28:52.398 --> 28:53.966
- How long does he have
if we keep him here

28:54.000 --> 28:56.402
and pump him full of pills?

28:56.435 --> 28:59.038
- 48 hours.

28:59.071 --> 29:02.041
At best.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.776
And it's not gonna be pretty.

29:13.352 --> 29:13.752
.

29:13.786 --> 29:15.888
[wine sloshing in glasses]

29:20.226 --> 29:22.494
- We can't just leave him there.

29:30.369 --> 29:34.206
You had Snyder
eating out of your hand.

29:34.240 --> 29:35.942
If you told him
we were taking Bram home,

29:35.975 --> 29:39.378
he'd have no choice.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.948
- Look, I understand
why you're upset.

29:41.981 --> 29:43.983
But you got to look
at the situation objectively.

29:44.016 --> 29:45.818
Where are Bram's parents
in all this?

29:45.852 --> 29:48.554
Where are the sacrifices
that they're making?

29:48.587 --> 29:51.157
Your brother-in-law works
in law enforcement.

29:51.190 --> 29:53.359
If there were strings
to be pulled,

29:53.392 --> 29:57.864
I mean, he'd be pulling them,
don't you think?

29:57.897 --> 30:01.167
- [sighs]

30:01.200 --> 30:05.271
- Maddie, we've come...so far.

30:06.338 --> 30:08.540
And now we have position.

30:08.574 --> 30:11.978
We have power.

30:12.011 --> 30:13.980
To risk our family
for someone else's

30:14.013 --> 30:16.482
would just be foolish.

30:20.052 --> 30:22.521
We are so close

30:22.554 --> 30:24.991
to getting everything we want.

30:25.024 --> 30:28.394

[dogs barking in distance]

30:46.045 --> 30:47.379
- This is your stop.

30:50.582 --> 30:52.284
- I did everything you asked.

30:52.318 --> 30:54.453
I tried to help him--
- We're not gonna hurt you.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.422
- But understand this.

30:56.455 --> 30:58.057
You've helped the Resistance.

30:58.090 --> 30:59.892
As far as anyone who matters
is concerned,

30:59.926 --> 31:01.193
that makes you one of us.

[camera beeps]

31:08.935 --> 31:09.936
- What are those?

31:09.969 --> 31:12.171
- It's insurance.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.306
Imagine someday the Redhats
come knocking on my door,

31:14.340 --> 31:16.508
asking questions.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.044
I want them to know
just how helpful

31:18.077 --> 31:20.579
you've been to the cause.

31:20.612 --> 31:21.613
[vehicle door closes]

31:39.398 --> 31:42.134
- What happened?

31:42.168 --> 31:43.502

32:11.063 --> 32:13.632

I love what they've done
to my place.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.103
[coughing]

32:17.136 --> 32:19.171

Watch your step.

- [coughing]

32:55.174 --> 32:57.076
- We can't, Katie.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.610
- I know.

33:00.246 --> 33:02.714
- Even if we dropped him
at the Green Zone gates,

33:02.748 --> 33:04.416
best case scenario:

33:04.450 --> 33:07.419
they'll just get him
healthy enough to torture.

33:07.453 --> 33:12.158
Then he gives up you
and everybody else.

33:12.191 --> 33:15.561
There's no good out here.

33:15.594 --> 33:18.030

You're lucky, you know?

33:44.390 --> 33:47.526
The two of you.

33:47.559 --> 33:51.230
Not everyone gets
what you have.

33:51.263 --> 33:54.266
[coughing]

33:57.136 --> 33:58.537
- What do you need, son?

33:58.570 --> 34:01.340
- When I decided to fight,

34:01.373 --> 34:04.410
I knew it meant I probably
wouldn't live to be an old man.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.212
I guess...
[coughs]

34:06.245 --> 34:08.780
I guess I sort of fantasized

34:08.814 --> 34:12.218
that if I did die,

34:12.251 --> 34:14.286
I'd at least make a difference.

34:18.857 --> 34:23.662
- That's the thing
they don't tell you.

34:23.695 --> 34:27.099
There's no glory in any of it.

34:27.133 --> 34:29.701
- I know.

34:29.735 --> 34:32.671
But I still didn't think
I'd go out like this.

34:37.809 --> 34:40.879
I just want a soldier's death.

34:44.750 --> 34:47.419
Please, Will.

34:49.688 --> 34:52.791
I know it's over.

34:52.824 --> 34:55.794
If Homeland catches up to me,
I can't run.

34:55.827 --> 34:57.596
And I won't be able
to hold out.

34:57.629 --> 35:01.600
I--
[coughing]

35:01.633 --> 35:04.703
- You don't know
what you're asking.

35:04.736 --> 35:07.306
- Yeah, I do.

35:11.877 --> 35:15.347
Are you really gonna
make me die like this?

Your all is imp--

36:23.915 --> 36:25.884
- Alan.
This is a surprise.

36:25.917 --> 36:28.620
- Uh, a pleasant one, I hope.

36:28.654 --> 36:30.922
- I'm afraid
I actually don't have long.

36:30.956 --> 36:32.224
You know how it is.

36:32.258 --> 36:33.759
- Oh, uh, of course.

36:33.792 --> 36:35.927
Um, I-I just thought
you might be interested

36:35.961 --> 36:37.763
to hear about the visit

36:37.796 --> 36:41.267
I had today
from one Mr. Nolan Burgess.

36:43.869 --> 36:46.372
- I see.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.574
And what did he want?

36:48.607 --> 36:51.910
- He was very interested
in the Global Authority property

36:51.943 --> 36:54.580
that recently
came under my protection.

36:54.613 --> 36:56.248
And who could blame him?

36:56.282 --> 36:57.449
It's fascinating stuff.

36:57.483 --> 36:58.784
- Those shipments

36:58.817 --> 37:00.919
are supposed to be
strictly eyes-only.

37:00.952 --> 37:03.789
- That's exactly
what I told Nolan.

37:03.822 --> 37:06.292
But given my lowly position,
who am I

37:06.325 --> 37:09.261
to deny the request
of the Deputy Proxy?

37:09.295 --> 37:10.696
- What did he see?

37:10.729 --> 37:13.332
- I made sure to only show him
the empty ones

37:13.365 --> 37:15.867
and that seemed
to satisfy his curiosity.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.837
For the moment.
[clears throat]

37:18.870 --> 37:22.274
I know Nolan very well, which
means I know his ambitions.

37:22.308 --> 37:24.276
He isn't satisfied
with merely being the deputy

37:24.310 --> 37:25.711
to a bloc governor.

37:25.744 --> 37:28.280
And that's why I felt
it was my duty

37:28.314 --> 37:30.716
to alert you about his visit.

37:30.749 --> 37:35.287
You know, in--in case
his actions have broken rank

37:35.321 --> 37:38.690
in any way.

37:38.724 --> 37:41.460
- Well, thank you
for the call, Alan.

37:41.493 --> 37:43.595
I appreciate it.

37:43.629 --> 37:45.597

38:40.786 --> 38:42.688
- BB?

38:42.721 --> 38:44.756
- It was the RAP gauntlet.

38:44.790 --> 38:46.825
He was exposed to something.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.063
And then he wanted
to go out like a soldier.

38:55.133 --> 38:57.068
Where were you?

38:58.437 --> 39:02.073
- I was...working.

39:02.107 --> 39:04.976
Everything takes longer now.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.045
Can't just walk
down the street anymore.

almost fell apart today.

39:10.015 --> 39:12.518
You need to be there
to protect them from themselves.

39:12.551 --> 39:13.819
- I never asked for this.

39:13.852 --> 39:16.054
To have my face plastered
all over the bloc

39:16.087 --> 39:17.456
like some kind of revolutionary.

39:17.489 --> 39:18.790
- No, you didn't.

39:18.824 --> 39:20.125
But it's who you are now.

39:20.158 --> 39:21.793
You took those kids
under your wing.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.862
You put them on the run.
Now you have to lead.

39:23.895 --> 39:27.433
- They're not ready.
- So get them ready.

39:27.466 --> 39:28.800
You need to get
your house in order

on all of us.

Then why are we sealing it
in a lead-lined box?
