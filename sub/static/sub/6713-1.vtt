They want to know, "Where do l go?"

05:58.650 --> 06:01.152
So, what you do is sell them this map...

06:01.319 --> 06:03.112

-He's so good.

12:26.871 --> 12:30.207
l remember l was drinking
a grande espresso when l met you.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.419
That's right, and l thought
that was really sexy.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.838
-l was drinking cappuccinos.
-l remember.

12:36.005 --> 12:39.800
Then l went to lattes, and then now,
double espressos macchiato.

12:39.968 --> 12:44.096
And l'm now a big old, you know,
Chai-tea-latte, soy milk kind of guy.

12:44.305 --> 12:45.973
-Soy. Yeah.
-Because of the lactose.

12:46.141 --> 12:48.976
-Mm-hm. You're lactose intolerant now.
-Mm-hm.

12:49.144 --> 12:52.938
And l walked across the street,
and there you were and....

12:53.106 --> 12:54.231
Working on my Mac.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.358
-And l had my Mac.
-Your Mac.

12:56.568 --> 13:01.572
And there, and then, l look over
and she's reading J. Crew.

13:01.781 --> 13:06.368
That's so weird, as l was such a huge
J. Crew person then too. Still am.

13:06.536 --> 13:07.578
Mm-hm.

13:07.745 --> 13:10.706
We sometimes like to just go to
Starbucks on weekends and...

13:10.915 --> 13:12.249
...take an L.L. Bean catalog.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.042
l'll say, "Honey, what's new?"

13:14.252 --> 13:16.879
She has five minutes to look
and find what's new.

13:17.088 --> 13:19.214
They've been around forever.
We are so lucky.

13:19.382 --> 13:22.885
We were so lucky to have been raised
amongst catalogs.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.803
Oh, it's so much easier.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.514
You don't have to deal with people as much.

13:27.724 --> 13:29.725
You can just talk to the person
on the phone.

-Yeah.

HARLAN: l like to take Hubert
for a walk in the woods before...

13:37.108 --> 13:39.151
...l show him, because...

13:39.360 --> 13:42.613
...it's a more natural
kind of environment for him...

13:42.822 --> 13:44.781
...and it makes him relax,
and it makes me...

13:45.325 --> 13:48.410
...relax too, to not think about
the competition.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.497

13:51.664 --> 13:55.000
...smell the ground and all that, and, uh....

13:55.168 --> 13:57.336
What'd you smell? What'd you smell?

13:57.545 --> 14:01.298
See, a lot of times,
what he's doing is, he's--

14:01.466 --> 14:04.510
A bloodhound not only has a great nose,
but he also--

14:04.677 --> 14:07.304
They can talk.
So, what he's doing, he's talking.

14:07.472 --> 14:09.389
He's saying, "What'd you talk?"

14:09.599 --> 14:11.725
What'd you talk? What'd you talk?

14:11.935 --> 14:14.770
He's saying, "l'm ready."
That's when he's ready for a show.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.814
Because he says, "l'm ready. l'm ready."

14:18.024 --> 14:21.401

What is it, boy?

14:21.611 --> 14:24.905
He says, "l'm ready.
l've walked and l'm ready."

14:27.784 --> 14:30.744
...we'll get going
and it'll be showtime for you, right?

14:30.954 --> 14:33.914
Now, look at that.
The judge will look at him and say....

14:34.207 --> 14:38.210
"Hey. Hey. Hey."

14:38.378 --> 14:40.796
Sometimes l think he'll talk
to the judge and say:

14:41.005 --> 14:44.758
"Hey, judge. Hey, judge. Look at me."

14:44.968 --> 14:47.427
l mean, the dog isn't going to talk.

14:47.637 --> 14:50.389
But his mind is like a telepathy...

14:51.266 --> 14:52.641
...thing where he says:

14:52.850 --> 14:57.312
"l'm the best one here.
l'm the best one you've ever seen."

14:57.814 --> 15:00.482
The judge, in his mind,
because he can pick up...

15:00.692 --> 15:02.568
...on the telepathy, will...

15:03.027 --> 15:04.987
...sometimes give him...

15:05.989 --> 15:07.364
...the blue ribbon.

15:07.615 --> 15:11.743
"Hey, judge! What's going on in there?

15:11.995 --> 15:13.829
l know what you're thinking.

15:14.038 --> 15:18.292
And l'm the best dog in the whole ring."
See?

15:18.501 --> 15:21.128
That's not a bad idea.
Maybe l just should...

33:08.612 --> 33:11.489
ROBlN: You were wonderful.
CHEF: You were magic.

33:11.698 --> 33:14.158
ROBlN: Don't forget, Saturday
we have reservations.

33:14.368 --> 33:17.036
Look. They're having spring rolls. Hi.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.996
-Hi.
-Hey! Hi, l'm Robin.

33:19.206 --> 33:20.998
-l'm Christy.
-How are you?

33:21.208 --> 33:23.292
-l'm Chuck.
-My God! You're so short!

33:23.543 --> 33:24.877
Camera adds a few inches.

33:25.087 --> 33:28.297
l saw you in a store a year ago.
You looked beautiful.

33:28.507 --> 33:29.548
ROBlN:
Oh, thank you.

33:29.800 --> 33:33.427
-And this is....
CHRlSTY: Butch! "Rhapsody in White."

33:33.637 --> 33:35.638
Butch? But isn't Butch a bitch?

33:35.847 --> 33:38.891
-Butch is a bitch.
MAN: Robin and Chuck, be ready in 1 0.

33:39.101 --> 33:42.478
-There's coffee if you're interested.
CHRlSTY: Oh, thank you. Yes.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.355
MAN: Five seconds.
-Here we go.

33:44.564 --> 33:47.692
CHRlSTY: l love Japanese food.
-l have to rearrange.

33:47.901 --> 33:49.151
Energy.

33:49.653 --> 33:50.695
And we're back!

33:50.904 --> 33:52.863
And it is a big night here tomorrow.

33:53.073 --> 33:56.033
The Mayflower's
Annual Kennel Club Dog Show.

33:56.243 --> 34:00.371
And with us, owner Sherri Ann Cabot
and handler Christy Cummings...

34:00.580 --> 34:03.749
...with their two-time champion,
Rhapsody in White. Welcome.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.501
-Welcome-- Thank you!
ROBlN: Yes.

34:05.711 --> 34:08.003
Well, l am particular about my hair.

34:08.213 --> 34:11.047
-But this....
-Well, this takes about two hours.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.299
[CHUCKLES]

34:12.467 --> 34:15.177
What's with the plumber-butt thing
happening on the hip?

34:15.554 --> 34:19.681
These pom-poms are keeping, um,
Butch's hips warm from the cold water.

34:19.933 --> 34:23.893
-The hip joints. lt's very important.
ROBlN: The little drummerette things--

34:24.146 --> 34:26.731
-Right. We keep--
-Those act as flippers.

34:27.690 --> 34:28.733
Right.

34:29.359 --> 34:32.987
-Look at this, sweetie.
-Look, Winky! Look, at the lights.

34:35.991 --> 34:37.574
Welcome to the Taft. May l help you?

34:37.784 --> 34:40.953
Yes. You should have a reservation
for Fleck.

34:41.163 --> 34:42.580
Mayflower group.

34:43.915 --> 34:47.293
Great. Gerald and Cookie Fleck.
We got you for two nights.

34:47.460 --> 34:50.588
-Queen-size, nonsmoking.
-That is correct, sir.

34:50.797 --> 34:53.757
MARK: You want to put this on a credit card?
-Yes.

34:54.301 --> 34:56.385
Drove up from, uh, Florida.

34:56.594 --> 34:57.595
Well, welcome.

34:57.804 --> 35:00.347
-Thank you very much.
-How was the drive?

35:00.557 --> 35:04.059
Oh, just a super drive.
Put a few clicks on the old odometer...

35:04.269 --> 35:07.229
...let me put it that way.
Good weather for most of it.

35:07.439 --> 35:10.316
A little cloudy
coming up through West Virginia.

35:10.525 --> 35:13.319
Then it stayed overcast through Virginia.

35:13.528 --> 35:17.656
But once we get into Pennsylvania,
it's still overcast.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.825
Now, there's a little problem.

35:19.993 --> 35:23.454
Um, l'm not sure--
Do you have another credit card?

35:23.914 --> 35:25.873
No. That's the good one.

35:26.124 --> 35:27.875
-That should work.
-Give it a rub.

35:28.084 --> 35:30.628
Yeah, check the strip.
Sometimes the change or the keys....

35:30.796 --> 35:32.129
Hmm.

35:32.297 --> 35:36.300
No, you see, it's coming up bad each time.

35:36.510 --> 35:38.552
No, that's a mistake. That's the good card.

35:38.762 --> 35:40.971
MARK: Do you have another--?
-That's the good card.

35:41.223 --> 35:44.141
l think you should call them,
because that's a mistake.

35:44.392 --> 35:46.852
-Let me give them a ring.
COOKlE: Don't worry, Gerry.

35:47.020 --> 35:50.189
l had to pay the cable, the gas,
and the water. They're covered.

35:50.357 --> 35:53.317
-lt's gotta be a mistake, honey.
-They're off our backs, but this....

35:53.485 --> 35:54.860
Yeah, no. lt's okay.

35:55.111 --> 35:59.114
Do you want to talk to the cardholder?
Because he wants to talk to you.

35:59.324 --> 36:03.828
Yes, yes. Hello? Yes. Who am l speaking to?

36:04.037 --> 36:05.913
Doreen? This is Gerry Fleck--

36:06.122 --> 36:07.873
Tell them they sent one notice.

36:08.083 --> 36:11.502
We're having a problem
with our card here, and-- Yes.

36:11.711 --> 36:14.630
We have till two to pay it.
Tell her we have till two.

36:14.840 --> 36:17.049
Till two notices.
We don't have to pay on--

36:17.259 --> 36:18.801
Well, two notices.

36:19.010 --> 36:23.764
My wife does all the bill-paying.
She's not a forgetful person.

36:24.766 --> 36:25.808
Hang on.

36:26.476 --> 36:28.310
Two notices, honey. They've--

36:28.520 --> 36:31.522
-Could l offer another suggestion?
-That's bull!

36:31.731 --> 36:34.692
lf you had cash
for two nights' deposit, then we'll--

36:34.901 --> 36:37.236
Yes. Yes.

36:37.654 --> 36:38.988
Uh, how much?

36:39.197 --> 36:41.323
Hundred and fifty dollars a night.
That's $300.

36:41.533 --> 36:45.244
And you'd be refunded a substantial
portion of that on checkout.

36:47.831 --> 36:50.040
We don't have $300.

36:50.250 --> 36:51.500
We....

36:51.710 --> 36:53.335
Well, l've got...

36:53.753 --> 36:55.504
...34.

36:56.464 --> 36:59.133
Uh, what about traveler's checks?

36:59.301 --> 37:01.468
Yes. We certainly take traveler's checks.

37:02.554 --> 37:05.306
-Did you get some?
-No.

37:08.310 --> 37:10.060
Let me see what l can do.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.856
CHRlSTY:
The excitement's starting to build.

37:14.024 --> 37:18.694
And, um, Butch has a light in her eyes
that says it's showtime.

37:18.904 --> 37:21.572
This is the beginning of our ritual...

37:21.740 --> 37:24.700
...this party, our preshow ritual
for the Mayflower.

37:24.910 --> 37:27.202
And we just did the official toast.

37:27.412 --> 37:31.040
And, um, the way it goes is that
when the ice sculpture--

37:31.249 --> 37:33.709
--which, as you can see, is Butch--

37:33.960 --> 37:37.463
--when the ice sculpture melts
all the way down, the party's over.

37:37.672 --> 37:41.008
And it looks like tomorrow's
gonna be a beautiful day.

37:41.176 --> 37:42.176
Mm.

37:42.344 --> 37:45.387
This year, we're adding a new element
to the preshow ritual.

37:45.597 --> 37:48.265
Sherri will do my makeup. l'm very excited--

37:48.516 --> 37:53.520
lt's a way for me to relax, and it's also
a way for me to show, again, my art.

37:53.730 --> 37:56.315
And she's the epitome of glamour,
you know...

37:56.524 --> 37:59.026
...so l feel like l'm in good hands.

37:59.235 --> 38:01.362
l think she could use some glamour.

38:01.571 --> 38:04.615
Well, l don't know.
l'm not you, that's for sure.

38:04.783 --> 38:06.742
l apologize. This is all we have.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.078
We are so full up.

38:09.245 --> 38:13.207
Um, this is literally--
We don't want you out in the cold.

38:13.458 --> 38:16.794
So this will give you some sort of a place
to stay while you're here.

38:16.962 --> 38:20.005
Don't judge it by this.
We're gonna clean this stuff out...

38:20.215 --> 38:22.800
...and bring in a cot,
make it comfy for you.

38:23.009 --> 38:25.844
-Good. Oh, it's super. Really super.
-Yeah.

38:26.012 --> 38:28.097
-ls there a bathroom?
-Uh, yes. Two flights down.

38:28.306 --> 38:30.140
lt's the lobby bathroom.

38:30.350 --> 38:33.352
lt's stocked with paper towels,
toilet tissue and soap.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.396
You can freshen up in there.

38:36.356 --> 38:37.439
Thank you.

38:37.857 --> 38:41.318
-Um, room service?
-That's the good news.

38:41.486 --> 38:43.696
You're next to the kitchen. Literally.

38:43.905 --> 38:48.659
Grab somebody and get a menu.
And you'll be able to order from them.

38:48.868 --> 38:52.454
And say just "utility closet"?

38:52.664 --> 38:56.166
As a matter of fact, yeah.
l don't think we'll have a problem.

38:56.376 --> 38:58.711
l'll alert the staff to your presence too.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.921
And, um, l've gotta get back to the desk...

39:01.131 --> 39:03.882
...but anything you need,
just ask for Mark Schaefer.

39:04.092 --> 39:05.843
-Thanks so much.
-Thank you, Mark.

39:06.052 --> 39:07.553
-Thank you.
MARK: Bye-bye.

39:09.222 --> 39:11.849
l'm thinking about switching
to the mock turtleneck.

39:12.058 --> 39:14.852
-The charcoal one from Saks.
-Great. Okay.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.478
ls that not breathing or...?

39:16.688 --> 39:19.189
Well, it's breathing now, but at the party...

39:19.357 --> 39:21.525
...it's gonna be hot down there.

39:21.985 --> 39:25.696
Then again, it goes so well
with the trousers.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.532
Or l could go with the lamb's wool.

39:29.034 --> 39:31.994
But then again, you're gonna see
a lot of khaki down there.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.747
And this merlot looks good
with the gray.

39:35.040 --> 39:36.540
You know what?

39:37.083 --> 39:39.043
-Maybe we should stay.
-What?

39:39.252 --> 39:41.670
We should stay.
We shouldn't leave her up here alone.

39:41.880 --> 39:45.382
No, we have to go. We have to make
an appearance. You know that.

39:45.592 --> 39:48.719
-Are you upset, baby?
-Yes, of course she's upset.

39:48.928 --> 39:50.387
Don't be upset.

39:50.597 --> 39:53.724
Mommy and Daddy are only gonna--
Don't, not the lips.

39:53.933 --> 39:56.393
Mommy and Daddy are only gonna go
for a little bit.

39:56.644 --> 40:00.189
And we'll be back. Huh?
You got your busy bee.

40:00.398 --> 40:02.566
-You got busy bee.
-Oh, l want to stay.

40:02.776 --> 40:05.277
-You can't.
-l want to.

40:05.487 --> 40:06.862
You can't stay.

40:11.493 --> 40:14.286
-More Gouda, honey?
-No, thanks, Gerry.

40:14.704 --> 40:16.705
-Super party, huh?
-Yeah, but--

40:16.915 --> 40:19.917
You know, l ran into that woman
that owned the terrier.

40:20.085 --> 40:21.668
-Yeah?
-From Florida.

40:21.836 --> 40:25.714
We were in that show.
The Elvis, not Costello.

40:25.965 --> 40:29.343
-Remember that little terrier?
-The bitch that pushed Winky?

40:29.552 --> 40:31.345
Pushed him way off his gait?

40:31.554 --> 40:33.639
Cookie Googleman?

40:33.848 --> 40:36.517
-Yeah.
-lt is you. Malcolm.

40:37.018 --> 40:38.602
Malcolm?

40:39.687 --> 40:42.022
Gerry, my husband. This is Malcolm.

40:42.190 --> 40:45.025
-Malcolm, what's shaking?
-Not much, Gary. How are you?

40:45.193 --> 40:47.611
-Doesn't she look fantastic?
-Boy, l'll say.

40:47.862 --> 40:49.404
COOKlE: Thank you.
-Just fantastic.

40:49.614 --> 40:52.908
Been what? l don't know,
1 8, 1 9 years? Louisville.

40:53.827 --> 40:56.537
The Mint Julep.
You were working as a waitress.

40:56.746 --> 40:57.955
Wow.

40:58.832 --> 41:01.041
Malcolm. Malcolm, Malcolm, Malcolm.

41:02.127 --> 41:04.503
You know, l've banged a lot
of waitresses in my day.

41:04.712 --> 41:06.588
But you were the best. By far.

41:06.798 --> 41:09.383
-You don't forget the best.
-Nope.

41:09.634 --> 41:11.385
Oh, Gerry. Oh, Gerry.

41:11.594 --> 41:14.429
They gotta do something
about the air conditioning.

41:14.639 --> 41:15.722
Great to see you.

41:15.974 --> 41:17.307
Nice to see you, Malcolm.

41:17.517 --> 41:18.934
Keep them up. Keep them up.

41:19.185 --> 41:23.605
The beat goes on, okay?
The beat goes on. Gerry, my husband.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.524
Don't worry, l know where l am.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.651
-Just....
-But that was fun.

41:29.320 --> 41:32.197
THEODORE: Your house is beautiful.
The food is delicious.

41:32.407 --> 41:35.742
And to see Butch with her crown on.
lt's so cute.

41:35.952 --> 41:38.287
CHRlSTY: That's her game face.
Absolutely right.

41:38.496 --> 41:40.164
THEODORE: She winked at me.
-Did she?

41:40.373 --> 41:42.416
THEODORE: She winked at me.
-You little flirt.

41:43.168 --> 41:46.003
She's not gonna wear
the crown tomorrow, is she?

41:46.212 --> 41:50.632
-No, she'll walk around as if she were.
-lt is. lt's a fun party.

41:50.842 --> 41:53.969
-We only do that once a year.
-She must be very proud.

41:54.179 --> 41:55.387
-You bet.
-Oh, yeah.

41:55.597 --> 41:57.806
-lt's her night.
-lt is. She's the star.

41:58.016 --> 42:00.767
And hopefully, she's going to be
the star tomorrow.

42:00.977 --> 42:02.936
-We'll have to see.
-That's up to her.

42:03.146 --> 42:06.440
-l guess. And some other people.
-lt's in her hands.

42:06.608 --> 42:09.568
Some think if you're on a small creek,
a small body of water...

42:09.777 --> 42:11.612
...that you have to use a small fly.

42:11.821 --> 42:14.489
But l've been in situations,
even on a big river...

42:14.699 --> 42:18.660
...where l'm using a size 1 8,
a size 20, a size 22.

42:18.870 --> 42:21.830
l go with a dropper
or with a Parachute Adams.

42:22.040 --> 42:25.459
A PT Nymph on the end,
and you could hook a big fish.

42:25.668 --> 42:27.502
Many think you have to go with...

42:27.712 --> 42:30.839
...a Woolly Bugger or Sculpin pattern
of some kind.

42:31.049 --> 42:36.011
Maybe Egg-Sucking Leech, which l've
never had any luck with myself.

42:36.179 --> 42:37.930
ls that L.L. Bean?

42:38.139 --> 42:39.556
-ls this L.L. Bean?
-This?

42:39.766 --> 42:40.766
Can l check?

42:40.975 --> 42:42.684
-l don't know.
-Oh, Hamilton.

42:42.894 --> 42:44.978
What? Just checking.

42:45.146 --> 42:48.357
Stefan, Stefan.
This is my "euphemism," Stefan.

42:48.566 --> 42:50.442
l want you to meet my new friends.

42:50.652 --> 42:53.362
-How are you, Gerry?
-Stefan.

42:53.571 --> 42:56.573
-Hello. You're Coo...?
-No, it's Cookie.

42:56.783 --> 42:58.659
lt's Cookie!

42:58.868 --> 43:01.328
-l was noticing your pants.
-That's not all.

43:01.496 --> 43:02.496
And then l noticed this.

43:02.705 --> 43:03.747
-Very funny.
-To death.

43:03.957 --> 43:06.750
Did he tell you his name's Mary,
as well as advertising it?

43:06.960 --> 43:11.505
-He was introduced as Mary, but--
-You know what? My name's not Mary.

43:12.048 --> 43:14.091
-lt's Debbie!
-lt's not. lt's Debra!

43:14.300 --> 43:15.300
No, it's Scott.

43:15.468 --> 43:19.137
Do you have an appreciation for the

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,

they come to the Mayflower...

in this building is as excited as l am.

-l did. l did. Follow the Lead.

of schools around--

So this is right down your alley.

-Yes.
-She looks at the teeth....

all attributes are examined.

Ouch! Do l see right?
Where's she putting her hand?

and then back up?

49:32.386 --> 49:33.803

For the dog's gait and movement,
to see the small angles.

this thing in particular.

a Sherlock Holmes hat on it...

a dog in a funny way?

if you put them on a football team...

which would be your tight end?
