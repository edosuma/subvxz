WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:03.271
You jerk.
It's not funny.

00:03.304 --> 00:05.273
Yes, it is.
Stop it!

00:05.306 --> 00:07.341
(running footsteps)
(door slams)

00:07.375 --> 00:09.777
ANNOUNCER: Better Things.
All new Thursdays at 10:00
on FX.

00:13.081 --> 00:16.617
FXX presents You're the Worst.

00:23.191 --> 00:26.127
Jimmy, brah,

00:26.160 --> 00:29.397
you will not believe the illness
I got into last night.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.265
Where the hell have you been?!

00:31.299 --> 00:33.167
People magazine is coming
to interview me.

00:33.201 --> 00:34.535
And thus, as per
our munificent

00:34.568 --> 00:36.670
landlord-transient
squatter agreement,

00:36.704 --> 00:39.707
you need to make me some
toast soldiers for sustenance.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.542
Then, when they arrive,

00:41.575 --> 00:43.677
tell them how I
selflessly saved you

00:43.711 --> 00:46.147
from a life living
in a trash can

00:46.180 --> 00:48.716
like the green fellow
in that puppet slum.

00:48.749 --> 00:50.751
Come on, now.
Oh, and as you cook,

00:50.784 --> 00:52.820
do that thing
where you babble incessantly,

00:52.853 --> 00:55.556
and my mind goes blank
like I'm in a hot air balloon,

00:55.589 --> 00:57.425
floating, floating.

00:57.458 --> 00:59.427
It so calms my nerves.

00:59.460 --> 01:04.198
Cool. So, there I was at Boudoir
Bar for New School Rap Night.

01:04.232 --> 01:08.202
My Tinder date: a strawberry
blonde with respectable Cs.

01:08.236 --> 01:10.704
Oh, side note: I've developed
this dating technique.

01:10.738 --> 01:13.441
It's like negging,
but wicked sensitive.

01:13.474 --> 01:15.743
Ah, yes, that's it.
(toilet flushes)

01:15.776 --> 01:17.745
So what happened?
She eat your dick or what?

01:20.414 --> 01:21.749
Uh...

01:21.782 --> 01:24.185
mo-mostly hand stuff.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.254
Nice!

01:26.287 --> 01:28.522
Gettin' some knuckle
on the first date.

01:28.556 --> 01:29.523
(mouthing)

01:29.557 --> 01:31.091
(whispering):
I don't know.

01:31.825 --> 01:34.762
No. Just go...

01:36.897 --> 01:40.768
So, Jimmy, uh, te-tell me more
about this interview.

01:40.801 --> 01:44.205
Uh, well, my
publisher arranged it.

01:44.238 --> 01:47.675
Um, I'm going to suggest
we do it at Soho House.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.877
Soho House?
Last time I was there,

01:49.910 --> 01:52.213
I puked
in Kristen Stewart's bowler hat.

01:52.246 --> 01:55.516
Shit, I'm still fungry!

01:56.717 --> 01:58.252
(gasps)
Yo!

01:58.286 --> 02:00.621
We got hella new snackies!

02:00.654 --> 02:02.656
Cheesy crackers?
"F" to the yeah.

02:02.690 --> 02:05.259
Edgar, you're a goddamn genius.

02:07.928 --> 02:09.763
Okay.

02:09.797 --> 02:11.399
(sighs)

02:11.432 --> 02:13.167
I'm heading to my room.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.637
But first,

02:16.670 --> 02:19.740
I got to hork down all these
cheesy bitches right quick.

02:27.881 --> 02:30.318
(coughing)

02:36.457 --> 02:39.660
* I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:39.693 --> 02:41.729
* I'm gonna leave you
anyway *

02:41.762 --> 02:44.232
* Gonna leave you anyway.

02:50.471 --> 02:52.273
What's she doing here?
I don't know.

02:52.306 --> 02:54.275
Well, are you guys
back together?
I don't know!

02:54.308 --> 02:56.410
Oh, man, this sort of
situational murkiness

02:56.444 --> 02:58.712
with no road map for
success makes me anxious.

02:58.746 --> 03:00.548
It's the fog of war, bro.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.816
It reminds me of this one time
in the Al Anbar province.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.853
There was this little
boy who was wearing...
(knocking)

03:05.886 --> 03:07.355
They're here.

03:07.388 --> 03:09.323
Okay, um...
I'll invite them in.

03:09.357 --> 03:10.958
"Hello, hello.
Jimmy's a saint."

03:10.991 --> 03:12.560
Then you disappear,

03:12.593 --> 03:14.495
and we'll head down Sunset

03:14.528 --> 03:16.897
and straight into the pages
of America's favorite purveyor

03:16.930 --> 03:19.300
of soft journalism.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.969
(sighs)

03:22.002 --> 03:24.838
James, so lovely
to see you again.
I... (mutters)

03:24.872 --> 03:27.241
Oh. Oh.
Oh. Oh. Yup.

03:27.275 --> 03:29.643
Oh. Three.
(both chuckle)

03:29.677 --> 03:31.779
This is Genevieve
from People.
Okay.

03:31.812 --> 03:33.881
Um, why is there a camera crew?

03:33.914 --> 03:35.883
It's an on-camera
interview?

03:35.916 --> 03:37.918
For People's
streaming series,

03:37.951 --> 03:39.720
Where the Magic Happens.

03:39.753 --> 03:42.323
They come and interview
artists in their homes.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.858
It was in the e-mail I sent you.

03:44.892 --> 03:48.596
Okay, quick note:
I never read past the subject

03:48.629 --> 03:51.732
unless the e-mail's subject is,
"Read Past Subject!"

03:51.765 --> 03:54.502
Or "Big Fan!"
GENEVIEVE:
Let's set up

03:54.535 --> 03:56.537
by the windows.
That way, we can frame him

03:56.570 --> 03:58.472
with the sun setting
over the reservoir.
Mm.

03:58.506 --> 04:02.276
Well, that's east,
and it's morning.
We'll fix it in post.

04:02.310 --> 04:04.778
(quietly):
Can I, uh...?
Oh.

04:07.848 --> 04:11.485
So, um, Gretchen is here.

04:11.519 --> 04:13.020
You two aren't back
together, are you?

04:13.053 --> 04:14.788
No.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.057
Um, I mean, we haven't really
discussed our status.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.692
Because that would
really interfere

04:18.726 --> 04:20.428
with the marketing
of the book.

04:20.461 --> 04:22.963
We're selling you
as a bachelor Brit

04:22.996 --> 04:24.632
with eyes of frosted steel.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.634
Steel is a bit cold.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.536
I mean, maybe cornflower?

04:28.569 --> 04:30.671
I worked my ass off
getting you this interview.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.907
Usually, People magazine will
not touch an unknown author

04:33.941 --> 04:37.044
unless they just escaped from
a kidnapper's sex dungeon.

04:37.077 --> 04:39.580
So you need to make sure
she doesn't come upstairs.

04:39.613 --> 04:43.317
If you tell Gretchen there's a
place she can't go, she's going.

04:43.351 --> 04:45.653
Whether it's a bar,
a McDonald's PlayPlace,

04:45.686 --> 04:47.821
a public pool
during kids' swim.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.290
Deal with it... now.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.397
Um...

04:56.430 --> 04:58.399
Jimmy saved my life.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.934
Oh.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.671
We can CGI him into
a floor lamp, right?

05:03.704 --> 05:05.272
Yeah, totally.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.412
(man and woman moaning
on computer screen)

05:11.445 --> 05:13.747
Konnichiwa.

05:13.781 --> 05:16.817
(moaning continues on computer)

05:16.850 --> 05:20.554
So, apparently, this interview
is happening upstairs.

05:20.588 --> 05:24.625
And so, it's vital that
you stay down here.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.894
(moaning continues)

05:26.927 --> 05:30.998
That doesn't mean
you can't go upstairs.

05:31.031 --> 05:33.501
Gretchen can go anywhere.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.102
I can go anywhere!
Yeah. I would just

05:35.135 --> 05:38.906
personally really, really
appreciate it if you laid low.

05:41.742 --> 05:45.045
Hmm.

05:45.078 --> 05:47.415
Hmm.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.520
Hmm.

05:54.054 --> 05:56.624
Hmm. Oh.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.526
(moaning continues)

05:58.559 --> 06:01.361
Hmm.
(hammering)

06:02.763 --> 06:04.865
I can probably make that work.

06:04.898 --> 06:06.600
I have to finish

06:06.634 --> 06:08.469
this pint of Bubble Cream.

06:08.502 --> 06:11.171
Plus, I really need to find out
where this bang bus is headed.

06:11.204 --> 06:14.542
They said they're going
to San Diego, but they just keep

06:14.575 --> 06:16.644
driving around the same
neighborhood in the Valley.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.045
Something is up.

06:18.078 --> 06:20.514
Mmm. Gum?

06:23.851 --> 06:25.953
MAN:
Oh, yeah, baby, oh, yeah.

06:25.986 --> 06:28.388
(moaning continues on computer)

06:35.095 --> 06:37.431
(chuckles, sighs)

06:37.465 --> 06:40.100
Psst, psst, psst,
psst, psst. Come on.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.703
Right, she's acting
really weird.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.438
Like David Bowie
in Labyrint weird,

06:44.472 --> 06:46.039
or like Kevin in We Need
to Talk about Kevin weird?

06:46.073 --> 06:48.776
She's watching pornography
fully clothed.
Kevin weird.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.844
All right, that's it. I need
to get her out of the house.

06:50.878 --> 06:53.046
Well, I could try to talk
to her, but Gretchen...
Oh, thank you, Edgar.

06:53.080 --> 06:54.715
I'll get you something nice
in return,

06:54.748 --> 06:56.550
like an Olive
Garden gift card

06:56.584 --> 06:57.951
from that rack for poors
at Rite Aid.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.722
(sighs heavily)

07:01.755 --> 07:03.123
(knocking)

07:03.156 --> 07:05.659
Hey, Gretchen.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.995
Hey yourself,
you big stud!

07:10.831 --> 07:13.100
Uh, I was just thinking.

07:13.133 --> 07:17.671
It is such a beautiful day
outside.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.807
You know, just in case you...

07:19.840 --> 07:21.742
wanted to

07:21.775 --> 07:23.844
get out of the house for...

07:23.877 --> 07:25.679
Um...

07:25.713 --> 07:27.681
I-I-I found a, um...

07:27.715 --> 07:29.817
a discount ticket Web site
that's full

07:29.850 --> 07:31.952
of amazing cultural events.

07:31.985 --> 07:36.490
There's Uterus the Musical
at Glendale Community College.

07:36.524 --> 07:39.693
Huh? The El Capitan Theatre
is showing

07:39.727 --> 07:42.229
Pixar's Birds with a live show.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.832
Gary Sinise and the
Lieutenant Dan Band are playing

07:44.865 --> 07:46.834
the San Pedro Lobster Chomp!

07:46.867 --> 07:48.802
I'm not
leaving, Edgar.

07:51.772 --> 07:54.808
(in guttural voice):
I'm staying here.

07:56.610 --> 07:58.746
Forever.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.282
For...

08:02.315 --> 08:04.618
eh...

08:04.652 --> 08:07.655
ver...

08:07.688 --> 08:09.122
(guttural utterance)

08:09.156 --> 08:12.125
Shit!

08:12.159 --> 08:14.662
(panting)

08:18.832 --> 08:21.168
(whimpering)

08:22.169 --> 08:24.137
(panting)

08:24.171 --> 08:26.006
She's crazy, Jimmy.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.875
How about I get my go bag
and we both just move

08:27.908 --> 08:29.309
to the Safari Inn in Burbank?

08:29.342 --> 08:31.144
We can't do that.
I've done it before.

08:31.178 --> 08:33.146
One time we found a nest
of camel spiders on base,

08:33.180 --> 08:34.948
so we packed up, hit the
entrance with a truck-bomb,

08:34.982 --> 08:36.617
and pretended
the Taliban did it.

08:36.650 --> 08:38.018
What were they gonna say?

08:38.051 --> 08:39.086
CANDACE:
We're almost ready
for you, Jimmy!

08:39.119 --> 08:40.921
I cannot believe she'd threaten
my job like this.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.790
Why isn't she at her job?

08:42.823 --> 08:44.792
She's told her clients
she's in Europe.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.760
Jimmy. That's
compromising material.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.061
Blackmail her.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.630
(glass shattering)
I'm out.

08:49.663 --> 08:50.998
Save yourself.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.302
(thud, groans)

08:55.335 --> 08:57.571
What?

08:57.605 --> 08:59.607
(glass shattering)

09:06.947 --> 09:09.650
(whistling)

09:09.683 --> 09:11.218
(clattering nearby)

09:14.387 --> 09:16.857
Where's the box spring?

09:18.358 --> 09:20.227
Down there.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.197
Oh. Why the
sad face, Puppy?

09:24.231 --> 09:28.335
You still worried I'm coming
upstairs to nuke your interview?

09:28.368 --> 09:32.072
No, because I have my own nuke.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.274
It's a text to Slim,

09:34.307 --> 09:36.677
Shit-Show, and Honey Cake,

09:36.710 --> 09:40.147
revealing that you
are not in Europe.

09:40.180 --> 09:41.214
(camera shutter clicks)

09:41.248 --> 09:43.717
Complete with a
time-stamped photo.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.154
Leave now or I will expose you

09:47.187 --> 09:49.222
as the fraud you are.

09:49.256 --> 09:50.991
Boom.

09:53.426 --> 09:54.962
New rule:

09:54.995 --> 09:56.630
no matter what happens,

09:56.664 --> 09:59.132
we don't ruin profesh shit
for each other.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.070
Truce?

10:08.408 --> 10:10.878
Truce.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.913
So, are we all good?

10:12.946 --> 10:14.147
Oh, hold on.

10:15.683 --> 10:17.250
(clattering and thud)

10:17.284 --> 10:19.019
Yeah, we're good.

10:20.420 --> 10:22.255
Your lemon tree,
on the other hand...

10:22.289 --> 10:23.991
What?

10:24.024 --> 10:26.226
(whining):
Oh, Juicy.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.731
Uh, she's not leaving,

10:30.764 --> 10:32.933
but it's fine,
this is fine.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.735
You trust that she's
gonna stay down there?

10:34.768 --> 10:36.737
I don't trust her to
drive a bumper car.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.438
Don't screw me here.
I cannot jeopardize

10:38.471 --> 10:40.407
my longstanding
relationship with People,

10:40.440 --> 10:42.442
which dates back to when
they asked me for a quote

10:42.475 --> 10:46.279
that Ben Affleck did deserve
to be 2002's Sexiest Man Alive,

10:46.313 --> 10:48.348
even though, let's be honest,
it's like somebody put

10:48.381 --> 10:50.818
Tom Brady's chin
on Rachel Maddow.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.753
Well, let's just say

10:52.786 --> 10:54.888
that she and I have
reached a dГ©tente.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.357
Good boy.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.028
Okay, we ready?

11:01.061 --> 11:04.031
So, Genevieve, as you know,

11:04.064 --> 11:06.033
the book release is next week,

11:06.066 --> 11:08.435
and we're making
a big push at the Romance

11:08.468 --> 11:10.804
and Erotica Book Expo.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.906
So this will time
to drop with that.
Yes, thanks.

11:12.940 --> 11:16.076
So, Jimmy, what
inspired your book?

11:16.109 --> 11:17.778
The Width of a Peach was borne

11:17.811 --> 11:20.213
of the sensual stories
I wrote as a boy.

11:20.247 --> 11:22.916
See, Manchester was a harsh
place for a sensitive child

11:22.950 --> 11:25.052
who managed to escape
rat attack,

11:25.085 --> 11:27.788
cholera, laudanum overdose,

11:27.821 --> 11:30.791
and coming across an unexploded
German ordinance.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.126
But armed with a notebook

11:33.160 --> 11:35.796
and a piece of lead, I would
hide under the covers,

11:35.829 --> 11:40.000
using language to express
my forbidden desires.

11:46.106 --> 11:48.141
(knocking on door)
What? Why am I awake?

11:48.175 --> 11:49.409
Why were you asleep?

11:49.442 --> 11:50.978
It's like 2:00 in the afternoon.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.412
I was at my job
till 6:00 a.m.

11:52.445 --> 11:56.283
I did night work so long,
it turned into day.

11:56.316 --> 11:58.151
(groans)

11:58.185 --> 11:59.753
What happened to you?

11:59.787 --> 12:01.354
I fell down the hill behind
Jimmy's-- long story.

12:01.388 --> 12:02.990
Basically, (sighs)

12:03.023 --> 12:06.026
there's a real fubar situation
over there.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.295
Did that round tweenager
show up begging again?

12:08.328 --> 12:10.263
Just throw lemons at his belly

12:10.297 --> 12:12.232
till he runs back
to his side of the block.

12:12.265 --> 12:13.967
Gretchen's there.
What?!

12:14.001 --> 12:16.003
And she's acting
like a Japanese ghost.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.871
It is so spooky.

12:17.905 --> 12:20.841
God, I've been so distracted
at my job.

12:20.874 --> 12:23.376
I thought Gretchen was in
Eagle Rock boning that hunk.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.012
What hunk?

12:25.045 --> 12:27.114
Some married guy.
They hump in cars.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.249
See, this is why we need
to start a group text.

12:29.282 --> 12:31.418
I keep starting a chain
but no one responds.

12:31.451 --> 12:34.254
You guys probably aren't getting
them because my phone's so old.

12:34.287 --> 12:37.891
Yes. That's why
no one's responding.
Anyway,

12:37.925 --> 12:39.526
I can't go back
into that crazy house.

12:39.559 --> 12:41.128
It's triggering me.

12:41.161 --> 12:43.130
It's like when Dad moved out

12:43.163 --> 12:45.065
and no one told me,
and then, one day,

12:45.098 --> 12:47.801
there was a new guy living
in Mom's master suite.

12:47.835 --> 12:50.003
You got to call Gretchen
and get her to leave Jimmy's,

12:50.037 --> 12:53.340
but don't tell her
I told you she's there.

12:53.373 --> 12:54.942
Obviously.

13:00.580 --> 13:02.582
(grunts)
(phone ringing)

13:06.453 --> 13:08.088
Hey, girl.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.324
LINDSAY (singsongy):
Hey. What you up to?

13:14.361 --> 13:18.198
I just woke up
and you weren't here,

13:18.231 --> 13:21.468
so I thought, "Hey, where's
Gretchen?" And then I thought,

13:21.501 --> 13:23.070
"Probably with that married
guy," and then I thought,

13:23.103 --> 13:25.038
"Good one, Linds.
You're not as stupid

13:25.072 --> 13:27.174
as your swimming teacher
keeps saying you are."

13:27.207 --> 13:28.441
Want to hang out?

13:28.475 --> 13:29.843
Hang out where?

13:29.877 --> 13:31.311
It depends where you are.

13:31.344 --> 13:34.181
Like, you're not at Jimmy's
or anything?

13:34.214 --> 13:35.182
Too much.

13:35.215 --> 13:36.449
Shit.

13:36.483 --> 13:37.918
I'm at home.

13:37.951 --> 13:39.853
Where home?
Here home.

13:39.887 --> 13:42.455
Where are you exactly?
Linds...

13:42.489 --> 13:45.192
I live with Jimmy, just like
I have for a long time.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.960
But...

13:46.994 --> 13:49.462
I thought you lived here?
What?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.198
When did I live at your house?

13:51.231 --> 13:53.333
You've been here
for a few months.

13:53.366 --> 13:56.236
Oh, Puppy,
if I live at your house,

13:56.269 --> 13:57.971
then where's all my stuff?

13:58.972 --> 14:00.974
I don't know.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.343
I thought...

14:03.376 --> 14:05.545
You farted on my couch, right?

14:05.578 --> 14:07.614
You're very tired.

14:07.647 --> 14:09.983
I did night work for so long.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.484
I know.

14:11.518 --> 14:13.153
Get some sleep, sweetie.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.890
Okay. Bye, Gretchen.

14:18.458 --> 14:21.861
EDGAR:
So... what did you learn?

14:23.263 --> 14:25.265
I don't know what's real.

14:25.298 --> 14:26.967
JIMMY:
I write

14:27.000 --> 14:29.269
till 4:00 or 5:00 a.m.

14:29.302 --> 14:31.638
At dawn, I make my way down
to the reservoir,

14:31.671 --> 14:35.008
where the street vendors hawk
mangos y papayas.

14:35.042 --> 14:38.178
From them, I draw
both sustenance

14:38.211 --> 14:40.280
and cultural inspiration.

14:43.716 --> 14:45.685
Where's bitch?!

14:45.718 --> 14:48.188
She's not here.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.689
You texted us
that she was here.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.191
Now-now either you're lying

14:51.224 --> 14:53.026
or MetroPCS is lying,

14:53.060 --> 14:55.262
and I know MetroPCS
ain't got no angle here.

14:55.295 --> 14:57.264
What? No.
Uh, I was going to,

14:57.297 --> 15:00.333
but I hit the blue
send-to-trash button.

15:00.367 --> 15:02.970
And, clearly, I haven't used
my phone in a few months.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.274
Listen, fellas,
you have to vacate.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.576
(whispering):
People magazine's
interviewing me.

15:09.609 --> 15:11.311
No shit?

15:13.246 --> 15:14.681
Yo.
Crossing.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.149
The cover story you did

15:16.183 --> 15:18.718
on the Hannah Montana reunion
made me cry.

15:18.751 --> 15:21.054
Billy Ray is so proud
of Miley.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.455
Thanks.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.057
Who are you guys?

15:25.658 --> 15:28.028
We really need
a better publicist.

15:28.061 --> 15:29.696
Speak of the bitch.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.198
Crossing.

15:33.233 --> 15:35.468
All right, see you
in a bit, fellas.

15:37.270 --> 15:40.607
* Her glance hits me
like lightning *

15:40.640 --> 15:42.575
* I heard that girl
is fast and frightening *

15:42.609 --> 15:46.246
No! No, no, no, no, no, no.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.448
You lied to us!

15:48.481 --> 15:49.616
You have not
been in Europe.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.584
(whining):
I was.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.586
I just got back.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.455
Honestly,

15:55.488 --> 15:57.124
Europe was a dream.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.326
So many bicycles and castles.

15:59.359 --> 16:01.094
One afternoon,
in South Berlin,

16:01.128 --> 16:04.331
I watched an old woman
play harmonium

16:04.364 --> 16:07.367
while a stray dog ate a
cheese sandwich out of my hand.

16:07.400 --> 16:09.469
SAM: There are no
stray dogs in Berlin.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.471
The animal welfare system
is tight.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.606
It was the old lady's dog.

16:13.640 --> 16:16.409
What kind of cheese
was on that sandwich?

16:16.443 --> 16:20.213
Resspelutchenbidenzer.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.414
Bitch, we know you've
been here this whole time!

16:21.448 --> 16:22.482
SHITSTAIN:
Yeah, Jimmy texted us

16:22.515 --> 16:23.616
and he ratted you out
pretty hard.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.352
Damn it, Jimmy!

16:25.385 --> 16:27.620
You said you befriended
Fatboy Slim on our behalf.

16:27.654 --> 16:31.124
Okay, guys, but think about
that-- what does that even mean?

16:31.158 --> 16:32.492
You are the worst--

16:32.525 --> 16:35.562
and I mean worst--
publicist I have ever met!

16:35.595 --> 16:38.165
And my dad is friends
with Paul Manafort!

16:38.198 --> 16:39.499
We needed you.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.534
Do you even know what's
going on right now?

16:41.568 --> 16:42.702
No.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.537
You want to tell her?

16:44.571 --> 16:45.772
You tell her.

16:45.805 --> 16:46.806
Tell me what?

16:46.839 --> 16:48.408
Turns out Zachary is

16:48.441 --> 16:50.143
45 years old!

16:51.278 --> 16:53.113
(laughs):
Honey Nutz is 45?

16:53.146 --> 16:55.515
We can't have a 45-year-old in
the group! This is a crisis!

16:55.548 --> 16:56.516
The other day he
was freestyling

16:56.549 --> 16:58.251
about how
the Challeng explosion

16:58.285 --> 17:00.253
really messed him up,
and the truth came out.

17:00.287 --> 17:01.654
We needed you,

17:01.688 --> 17:04.257
and you were nowhere
to be found!

17:04.291 --> 17:07.260
You better have some
mind-blowing explanation

17:07.294 --> 17:10.630
for lying to us, or we are
firing your ass for reals!

17:11.864 --> 17:13.833
Hey. You guys don't even know

17:13.866 --> 17:15.835
what happened with Jimmy,
do you?

17:15.868 --> 17:18.305
Uh-uh. No more
lies, bitch.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.174
God's truth,
stick a needle in my eye.

17:22.175 --> 17:23.576
(patting mattress)

17:26.313 --> 17:28.081
Okay.

17:28.115 --> 17:30.183
Three months ago
Jimmy took me to this spot

17:30.217 --> 17:31.584
above the Hollywood Bowl,

17:31.618 --> 17:33.720
pretending we were looking
for murder clues.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.288
GENEVIEVE:
Who are your favorite

17:35.322 --> 17:37.357
erotica authors?
Uh...

17:37.390 --> 17:39.426
see, there's a fine line
between erotica

17:39.459 --> 17:41.694
Mm.
and litera...
(stammering)

17:41.728 --> 17:43.263
Um...

17:45.598 --> 17:47.300
It's, uh...

17:47.334 --> 17:49.369
Hmm.

17:49.402 --> 17:50.870
(sighs)

17:50.903 --> 17:53.740
*

18:02.915 --> 18:04.351
SHITSTAIN:
You're a bad person,

18:04.384 --> 18:06.319
Jimmy Shive-Overly.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.587
(Sam chuckles)

18:07.620 --> 18:09.556
You dead, dude.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.726
Okay. Ha-ha!

18:13.760 --> 18:15.395
(door closes)
Yeah, bye, fellas!

18:15.428 --> 18:18.598
Okay. Uh, where were we?
Where were... um...

18:18.631 --> 18:21.601
Oh, God, Lindsay.
Does this mean we're in charge?

18:21.634 --> 18:23.736
I can't be in charge
of anything.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.339
I was in charge once in Iraq,
and it did not go well.

18:26.373 --> 18:28.608
In fact, that was the last time
we did Secret Santa.

18:28.641 --> 18:29.876
Maybe we could
get them back together

18:29.909 --> 18:31.411
while they're
under the same roof!

18:31.444 --> 18:32.745
LINDSAY:
I wish I'd thought of that

18:32.779 --> 18:34.614
when Mom was breaking up
with Uncle.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.350
I could have Parent-Trapped them
that weekend in Solvang.

18:37.384 --> 18:39.219
This is scary. Hold me.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.354
I'm getting
all cranked up.
Me, too, bud.

18:41.388 --> 18:42.522
Now, make my body
feel good.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.556
Mmm.

18:48.861 --> 18:50.263
What's more important,
characters or plot?

18:50.297 --> 18:52.532
I think characters

18:52.565 --> 18:54.501
are obviously...

18:54.534 --> 18:57.370
(footfalls approaching)
the essential...

18:57.404 --> 18:58.838
Why don't we finish this
at a coffee shop?

18:58.871 --> 19:00.407
Hi, sweetie.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.311
Oh! Oh, don't mind me.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.912
I am not here.

19:05.945 --> 19:08.448
Hi. I'm Gretchen Cutler,
Jimmy's fiancГ©e,

19:08.481 --> 19:10.650
The future Mrs....

19:10.683 --> 19:11.918
Is it Shive-Overly?
(chuckles)

19:11.951 --> 19:13.953
Maybe we'll do one
of those hybrid names

19:13.986 --> 19:15.555
the kids are
getting into.

19:15.588 --> 19:16.589
Cutler-y.

19:16.623 --> 19:17.590
Shitler.

19:17.624 --> 19:18.558
(laughing)

19:18.591 --> 19:19.392
GENEVIEVE:
What's going on?

19:19.426 --> 19:20.927
I just interviewed
him for an hour

19:20.960 --> 19:22.195
about his single life.

19:22.229 --> 19:22.895
Single?

19:23.796 --> 19:25.665
Why are they saying
you're single, Jimmy?

19:25.698 --> 19:26.933
What are you doing?

19:26.966 --> 19:28.601
What are you doing?

19:31.604 --> 19:33.273
Okay. You're right.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.442
I have been acting crazy.
Mm.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.677
But what is it that
happened to us, exactly?

19:37.710 --> 19:39.412
One,

19:39.446 --> 19:40.947
you asked me to marry you.

19:40.980 --> 19:42.815
Two, I said yes.

19:42.849 --> 19:45.218
Three, you left.

19:45.252 --> 19:46.486
And then four,
you came back,

19:46.519 --> 19:48.488
apologized,
and I said it was fine.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.822
Isn't that what happened?

19:49.856 --> 19:53.360
Ye-Yes. Technically.

19:53.393 --> 19:55.428
GRETCHEN:
Which means we
never stopped

19:55.462 --> 19:57.330
being engaged.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.635
We're still engaged,
Jimmy, right?

20:04.471 --> 20:06.205
Jimmy?

20:08.341 --> 20:11.544
Uh, c... can you just
give us a second?

20:12.679 --> 20:14.314
So, wait...

20:14.347 --> 20:16.449
you haven't been punishing me

20:16.483 --> 20:18.318
by taking over
the bedroom

20:18.351 --> 20:20.653
and refusing to leave?

20:20.687 --> 20:22.655
I just wanted you
to squirm a little.

20:22.689 --> 20:24.324
But now I find out

20:24.357 --> 20:26.025
you're supposed to be single
for the book?

20:26.058 --> 20:28.495
Maybe I should
move back out?

20:28.528 --> 20:30.463
Oh, don't. N...
Well, how are we

20:30.497 --> 20:32.231
gonna make this all work, then?

20:36.403 --> 20:38.938
What if I wasn't single?

20:38.971 --> 20:40.607
Jimmy...
What about

20:40.640 --> 20:43.610
a writer who isn't single

20:43.643 --> 20:46.012
and maybe makes mistakes?

20:46.045 --> 20:48.615
Human ones. But at
the end of the day,

20:48.648 --> 20:50.417
his heart's in
the right place.

20:50.450 --> 20:52.885
Is... is there something
you could do with that?

20:52.919 --> 20:54.887
I-It could be
aspirational.

20:54.921 --> 20:58.291
Everyone deserves love.

20:58.325 --> 21:00.460
That sounds very People.
Yeah.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.296
We could adjust
our strategy.

21:03.330 --> 21:04.497
It'll work.

21:04.531 --> 21:06.499
I'm a publicist.
You ever hear

21:06.533 --> 21:08.835
of the one that goes,
"Courtney Love is smart now"?

21:08.868 --> 21:11.704
That was you?
JIMMY: See, the
honest truth is,

21:11.738 --> 21:13.039
this book...

21:13.072 --> 21:15.508
this is our love story.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.710
And our story is chaotic,

21:17.744 --> 21:20.580
but love is chaos.

21:20.613 --> 21:24.551
And it's the only game
in town worth playing.

21:25.718 --> 21:27.987
What do you think?

21:28.020 --> 21:29.989
She can stay.

21:30.022 --> 21:32.925
Can we get
Gretchen miked?

21:32.959 --> 21:34.060
(sighs heavily)

21:34.093 --> 21:35.795
Hi.

21:35.828 --> 21:37.964
Hi.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.532
(knocking)

21:39.566 --> 21:40.800
Oh, 'scuse me

21:40.833 --> 21:42.969
(door opens)

21:43.002 --> 21:45.405
Hi, Booner!
Gretch, what's wrong?

21:45.438 --> 21:47.574
You said you had
an emergency?
Yup.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.542
Uh, it's downstairs.

21:49.576 --> 21:51.411
In the bedroom.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.045
I'll show you.

22:00.853 --> 22:02.389
Hello.

22:03.390 --> 22:04.724
(both chuckle)

22:07.159 --> 22:09.862
Shouldn't have texted the boys.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.566
Mushroom cloud, bitch!

22:13.600 --> 22:14.967
(imitates explosion)

22:15.001 --> 22:17.737
*

22:23.943 --> 22:26.879
(video game weapons firing)

22:29.749 --> 22:31.017
(door opens)

22:31.050 --> 22:32.719
Jimmy...

22:32.752 --> 22:34.454
we have to talk.

22:34.487 --> 22:37.457
We know you and Gretch
are going through a thing,

22:37.490 --> 22:39.726
but it's messing
with our brains.
Yeah,

22:39.759 --> 22:42.862
so there's something very
important we need you to hear.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.597
BOTH:
And-a one and-a two

22:44.631 --> 22:45.898
and-a one, two, three and...

22:45.932 --> 22:47.467
* There's one and one

22:47.500 --> 22:48.935
* And that makes two

22:48.968 --> 22:51.771
* But the two of you
are making us blue *

22:51.804 --> 22:54.907
* So let's end the fighting,
let's have fun *

22:54.941 --> 22:57.143
* And make two hearts
back into one... *

22:57.176 --> 22:59.912
(harmonizing):
* Back into one.

22:59.946 --> 23:02.415
(holding last notes)

23:03.182 --> 23:05.051
That was really beautiful.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.486
Why don't you go
downstairs

23:06.519 --> 23:07.920
and sing it to Gretchen.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.790
She's in the bedroom.

23:14.193 --> 23:16.663
(video game weapons firing)

23:18.531 --> 23:20.900
LINDSAY (whispers):
And-a one, and-a two,

23:20.933 --> 23:22.635
and-a one, two, three.

23:22.669 --> 23:25.905
* There's one and one...
(moaning,
gasping)

23:25.938 --> 23:26.906
(grunting)

23:26.939 --> 23:28.875
* I am alone

23:31.711 --> 23:34.514
* In this cold

23:34.547 --> 23:36.916
* After all

23:36.949 --> 23:40.653
We get two
Christmases now.

23:40.687 --> 23:43.122
* So hard

23:44.857 --> 23:46.926
* To hold back these tears

23:46.959 --> 23:48.528
* I'm caving in

23:48.561 --> 23:51.531
* Call me back one more *

23:51.564 --> 23:52.665
* Time *
* I

23:52.699 --> 23:54.801
* Live with a troubled mind

23:54.834 --> 23:56.469
* Call me back *

23:56.503 --> 23:58.070
* One more time *

23:58.104 --> 23:59.939
* You won't call me

23:59.972 --> 24:01.207
* One more time

24:01.240 --> 24:02.942
* Call me back *

24:02.975 --> 24:04.577
* One more time *

24:04.611 --> 24:06.746
* But I'm much too proud

24:06.779 --> 24:09.148
* To question why.

24:09.181 --> 24:12.451

24:15.121 --> 24:17.123
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH

24:19.692 --> 24:21.728
I don't know.
The timing just felt right.

24:21.761 --> 24:24.096
I was like,
"Is this really happening?"

24:24.130 --> 24:26.799
I looked her in the eyes
and just knew.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.035
It's a moment
I'll never forget.

24:29.068 --> 24:31.137
-(sighs)
-(sighs)

24:31.170 --> 24:33.072
I would dump her again
in a heartbeat.

24:35.542 --> 24:46.586
I hope he's morbidly
disfigured in a horrific
Jet Skiing accident.

ANNOUNCER:
American Horror Story: Cult.

24:48.154 --> 24:50.156
All new,
Tuesdays at 10:00 on FX.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.626
I have to eat
this onion?

24:53.660 --> 24:55.595
-Honey, trust me.
-(sighs)

24:55.628 --> 24:59.498
Your mom knows.
It's time for you
to learn these secrets.

25:04.270 --> 25:07.039
-How does this help?
-It doesn't. Ha!

25:07.073 --> 25:09.041
Oh, my God.
