00:01.935 --> 00:03.502
- <i>Previously on the strain...</i>

00:03.504 --> 00:05.104
- Regis 753 kennedy ground
please respond, over.

00:05.106 --> 00:09.675
- Oh my god.
- They're all dead.

00:09.677 --> 00:12.011
- We've got survivors.

00:12.013 --> 00:14.279
- 206 passengers are dead
and we don't know why.

00:14.281 --> 00:17.349
Four passengers survived
and we don't know why.

00:17.351 --> 00:20.319
- These regis air documents
point to a systems failure

00:20.321 --> 00:24.623
Aboard flight 753.
It's not a cdc case anymore.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.992
- There's that hum again.
- It's almost like an echo.

00:26.994 --> 00:29.995
- Doctor did you find
the coffin? It is not too late!

00:29.997 --> 00:32.297
Do not allow it
across the river!

00:32.299 --> 00:34.299
- Where is your master now?

00:34.301 --> 00:38.470
- What's your use for me?
- I want you to watch it unfold.

00:38.472 --> 00:41.540
Unable to do anything
to stop it.

00:41.542 --> 00:43.742
- I wanted to talk about
custody hearing tomorrow.

00:43.744 --> 00:45.744
- Mom says I should
just say how I feel.

00:45.746 --> 00:47.546
- And that I want
joint custody.

00:47.548 --> 00:50.215
- This is gary arnot.
Thank you for sending

00:50.217 --> 00:52.151
My little girl home to me.
- Are you saying someone

00:52.153 --> 00:54.820
Released her body to you?
- No, not her body.

00:54.822 --> 00:57.556
Emma's alive, she showed up
on my doorstep this morning.

01:09.836 --> 01:12.771
(classical music playing)

01:57.050 --> 02:00.786
(hissing)

03:06.986 --> 03:09.688
♪

03:25.805 --> 03:27.639
- I know...
- You know what?

03:27.641 --> 03:29.641
Where did they take the bodies?
- All 206 casualties are gone

03:29.643 --> 03:33.412
And the medical examiner,
so far as I can tell.

03:33.414 --> 03:35.414
- Well whaddya think?
Was it the government...?

03:35.416 --> 03:37.649
- We are the government, jim.
We can barely tie

03:37.651 --> 03:39.651
Our own shoes sometimes.
My money is on the military.

03:39.653 --> 03:41.587
- Why would they take
the bodies?

03:41.589 --> 03:43.589
- 'cause they don't want
them autopsied.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.324
- Is there more that
you know, everett?

03:45.326 --> 03:48.327
- No, and I don't want
to know, really.

03:48.329 --> 03:51.196
- The story that they all died
from an air floatation problem?

03:51.198 --> 03:53.332
Carbon monoxide poisoning?
We saw those bodies.

03:53.334 --> 03:56.201
There were no signs of that.
- It's ludicrous. Contemptuous.

03:56.203 --> 03:58.203
- So be it, as long as
it's not our diagnosis.

03:58.205 --> 04:00.005
- We have a responsibility,
everett.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.174
- If I remember correctly,
ephraim, you no longer have any

04:02.176 --> 04:04.443
Responsibility here, whatsoever.
You make sure

04:04.445 --> 04:07.212
The press gets nothing.
- Ok.

04:07.214 --> 04:10.382
- Radio silence from us.
- So what do we do now?

04:10.384 --> 04:13.418
- We do nothing. This is no
longer about disease control,

04:13.420 --> 04:15.721
This is about damage control.
And as of this moment,

04:15.723 --> 04:17.756
The cdc is an interested
observer, nothing more.

04:17.758 --> 04:21.226
Which I will be sure to stress
to the secretary of health

04:21.228 --> 04:24.429
And human services over
breakfast...

04:28.434 --> 04:30.969
- Why would the military
leave four surviving passengers?

04:30.971 --> 04:33.338
(elevator bell rings)

04:35.241 --> 04:40.112
- Jesus. Jesus, what did I do?

04:40.114 --> 04:42.781
(phone ringing)

04:42.783 --> 04:45.417
- Answering machine:
[you've reached greg nelson]

04:45.419 --> 04:47.953
[leave me a message]
- hey it's jim kent.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.822
We need to talk.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.833
- Gertie!

05:30.129 --> 05:32.431
- (whisper): <i>Ansel</i> ...

05:40.039 --> 05:42.341
- Ow!

05:47.947 --> 05:50.015
- Go play in the backyard.

05:50.017 --> 05:53.952
- You too, benji. Go on.

06:04.130 --> 06:06.465
- How are you feeling?

06:06.467 --> 06:10.402
- Much better. Uh, my throat
still hurts though.

06:10.404 --> 06:12.337
- I took the phone
off the hook.

06:12.339 --> 06:14.873
They showed our house
on the t.V. News.

06:14.875 --> 06:17.008
They're interviewing
the neighbours about us.

06:17.010 --> 06:21.880
- It'll pass. I'm home honey,
I'm fine. We're gonna be fine.

06:24.350 --> 06:26.385
- What if you have to go
back to the hospital?

06:26.387 --> 06:28.520
- I'm not going back
to the hospital.

06:28.522 --> 06:30.522
- Well you told me
that one of the doctors

06:30.524 --> 06:32.524
Wanted to quarantine you.
- Ann marie!

06:32.526 --> 06:36.428
- What if he finds out
that you're still sick?

06:40.032 --> 06:42.768
- They kept showing footage
of the plane just sitting there.

06:42.770 --> 06:46.671
Dark - dead on the tarmac -
over and over again.

06:46.673 --> 06:49.040
Like the trade centre,
remember?

06:49.042 --> 06:52.677
Why do they do that to us?
It's so painful to watch.

06:52.679 --> 06:54.913
I knew you shouldn't
have gone on that trip.

06:54.915 --> 06:59.918
- Ann marie!
- I just... I get so overwhelmed

06:59.920 --> 07:02.254
When you're gone.

07:02.256 --> 07:06.691
Gertie got out once.
She was missing all night.

07:06.693 --> 07:10.529
She came back hurt,
but I just hate chaining her up

07:10.531 --> 07:12.697
In the shed.
- Wait - gertie came back hurt?

07:12.699 --> 07:16.468
- She was hit
with something.

07:16.470 --> 07:19.504
(sound of bones cracking)
- ah!

07:21.707 --> 07:24.176
- You came back
hurt, too.

07:28.714 --> 07:31.116
(thumping sound)

07:31.118 --> 07:33.718
- Do you hear that?

07:33.720 --> 07:38.056
- Please, ansel.
Go back to bed.

07:38.058 --> 07:41.560
You have to
get better, ok?

07:51.771 --> 07:54.573
- (flaxton): <i>The documents that</i>
<i>have been haphazardly released</i>

07:54.575 --> 07:56.975
<i>Through the internet paints</i>
<i>an incomplete, distorted</i>

07:56.977 --> 08:00.579
<i>And untrue picture</i>
<i>of my airline's protocols.</i>

08:00.581 --> 08:02.581
<i>We're maintaining</i>
<i>the highest level</i>

08:02.583 --> 08:04.816
<i>Of safety in our industry.</i>
<i>(phone rings)</i>

08:04.818 --> 08:09.688
- Pest control services,
hold please.

08:09.690 --> 08:13.158
- <i>I have made safety</i>
<i>my number one priority...</i>

08:17.129 --> 08:20.966
<i>We must wait</i>
<i>for the ntsb's full report...</i>

08:20.968 --> 08:23.268
- The phone keeps ringing
but all I want to do

08:23.270 --> 08:25.770
Is watch this airplane coverage.
- <i>Any allegations...</i>

08:25.772 --> 08:28.306
- I'm never flying again.

08:28.308 --> 08:31.176
<i>- ... Of the aircraft being</i>

08:31.178 --> 08:35.714
- I mean shouldn't this man
be arrested or something?

08:35.716 --> 08:38.016
- He'll probably
get a bonus.

08:38.018 --> 08:40.852
This is a week's worth
of rat calls in one day.

08:40.854 --> 08:44.789
Why so many, huh?
Why? Why so many?

08:44.791 --> 08:46.791
- It's not a "why" business,
vasiliy.

08:46.793 --> 08:50.395
This is a "now" business. Rat
bite. First on your list today.

08:50.397 --> 08:52.364
Mayor's office
special request.

08:52.366 --> 08:54.165
- I don't work
for the mayor.

08:54.167 --> 08:57.636
- I do, and you work for me.
- I got an elementary school,

08:57.638 --> 09:00.338
A hospital and a church and you
want me to go to this guy first?

09:00.340 --> 09:02.908
- His daughter was bitten
by a muncher,

09:02.910 --> 09:05.577
And he's a hedge fund manager
and a major contributor.

09:05.579 --> 09:08.547
So yes, you will go there
first and you will be

09:08.549 --> 09:10.549
On your best behaviour. Got it?
- I'll wear my top hat

09:10.551 --> 09:12.751
And monacle.
- Just don't piss him off,

09:12.753 --> 09:14.920
Alright?

09:16.088 --> 09:17.889
(scoffs)

09:17.891 --> 09:20.525
- Neck rigidity, sensitivity
to natural light,

09:20.527 --> 09:23.495
Mental disorientation.
All clinical features

09:23.497 --> 09:25.263
Of a central nervous system
infection.

09:25.265 --> 09:28.833
- It could be a pam - primary
amebic meningoencephalitis.

09:28.835 --> 09:30.835
A very rare parasitic
meningitis.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.938
- It's a bloodworm,
and a nasty one.

09:32.940 --> 09:34.940
I know I'm asking
a lot of you but

09:34.942 --> 09:36.942
I'd appreciate it
if you'd all hang in there

09:36.944 --> 09:38.677
And develop a protocol
for captain redfern's treatment.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.780
I need all hands on deck here.
Thank you.

09:47.753 --> 09:53.091
- Doctor, I'm scared.
Am I going to die?

09:53.093 --> 09:57.696
- Doyle, we're going to
find out what's infecting you,

09:57.698 --> 10:00.599
And we're going
to make you well again.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.103
You have my word.

10:14.880 --> 10:18.483
- You can't promise him that.
- He's stuck in a plastic

10:18.485 --> 10:21.586
Containment tube, surrounded by
doctors who don't know anything.

10:21.588 --> 10:23.989
He needs a little hope.

10:25.591 --> 10:27.726
My hearing with zack's
in 45 minutes.

10:27.728 --> 10:29.728
- Go, redfern's covered.
- Alright, just let me know

10:29.730 --> 10:31.730
If anything changes. And we have
to check up on the health

10:31.732 --> 10:33.732
Of the other survivors, too.
- And I want talk

10:33.734 --> 10:36.601
To that old man.
- Who?

10:36.603 --> 10:39.738
- The one we had arrested
at the airport.

10:39.740 --> 10:41.740
He knew things, eph.

10:41.742 --> 10:44.476
- Fine. Anything, just--

10:44.478 --> 10:47.112
Yes. I'll call you.

10:47.114 --> 10:49.981
- Where the hell is jim?
(elevator rings)

11:05.264 --> 11:07.799
- Mr. Jim kent.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.335
- I'm here to see greg.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.137
- Yes, greg could not
be present.

11:12.139 --> 11:16.174
But we got your call.
Urgent, from the sound of it.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.476
- Well I'll come back
another time, then--

11:18.478 --> 11:21.112
- You are a member
of the canary project,

11:21.114 --> 11:24.649
The cdc's rapid response team
of field epidemiologists?

11:24.651 --> 11:28.553
- Who are you?
- I presume you're here about

11:28.555 --> 11:31.523
The airplane cargo.
The box?

11:31.525 --> 11:34.292
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

11:34.294 --> 11:37.395
- I refer specifically
to an ornately-carved cabinet

11:37.397 --> 11:42.867
You allowed out of
the airport security perimeter.

11:44.370 --> 11:47.205
- I made a deal with greg
to provide some information

11:47.207 --> 11:50.975
And let a piece of medical cargo
through customs. That's it.

11:50.977 --> 11:53.645
- Yes, and here is
the rest of the money

11:53.647 --> 11:56.781
Greg promised you
in return.

12:02.555 --> 12:06.825
- What was in the box?
Where are the corpses?

12:08.494 --> 12:10.695
I'm going to the police.

12:10.697 --> 12:15.066
- You must love
your wife very much.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.106
- What?
- To violate your terms

12:21.108 --> 12:24.109
Of employment
and to break the law.

12:24.111 --> 12:27.712
I understand there is a very
promising monoclonal antibody

12:27.714 --> 12:32.584
Trial for her form
of cancer in palo alto.

12:32.586 --> 12:36.121
30 000 people applied
but only 100 were accepted

12:36.123 --> 12:39.858
And your sylvia
was cruelly denied.

12:39.860 --> 12:42.127
- How do you know that?
I never said anything to greg.

12:42.129 --> 12:45.864
- Our company finances
the entire research program.

12:48.467 --> 12:50.702
The decision can
be reversed.

12:50.704 --> 12:52.871
It is not too late

12:52.873 --> 12:56.307
To see sylvia admitted
to the trial.

13:07.086 --> 13:10.221
I'm only doing this
to pay for her treatment.

13:10.223 --> 13:13.158
- Not only do I think
you will not go to the police.

13:13.160 --> 13:17.061
I feel confident
that we may continue

13:17.063 --> 13:20.799
To rely on your
good services.

13:24.904 --> 13:28.773
You have two bosses now,
jim kent.

13:28.775 --> 13:34.179
The ones you report
to at the cdc, and me.

13:44.356 --> 13:46.157
- Criminal trespass

13:46.159 --> 13:49.828
And interference
with a criminal investigation.

13:51.130 --> 13:55.200
Mister uh, is it set-rake-ian,
set-rack-ian?

13:55.202 --> 14:00.171
- As you like, your honour.
- Mr. Set-rack-ian,

14:00.173 --> 14:02.207
What in the name of
john f. Kennedy were you doing

14:02.209 --> 14:04.108
At the airport Saturday night?

14:04.110 --> 14:11.115
- I, uh, saw a story
on television about a plane

14:11.117 --> 14:15.854
That landed, I-- I guess I'm not
quite sure, your honour.

14:15.856 --> 14:18.857
I'm old an uh, things are not
that clear anymore.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.494
- I have here that
you own a pawn shop,

14:23.496 --> 14:27.332
Knickerbocker loans and curios
on east 118th street?

14:27.334 --> 14:32.537
- Yes, sir. All licensed
and, uh, registered.

14:32.539 --> 14:36.040
I--, I came here
after world war ii

14:36.042 --> 14:39.544
After the, uh, the camps
were liberated.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.980
(whispering)

14:41.982 --> 14:44.515
- Anybody live with you?
Any family?

14:44.517 --> 14:46.718
- I'm a widower,
your honour.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.653
- Children, grandchildren?

14:48.655 --> 14:51.055
- We were never so blessed.

14:53.826 --> 14:56.694
- Trespassing is
a nuisance charge,

14:56.696 --> 15:00.698
But what does
concern me is this.

15:00.700 --> 15:04.869
This is a concealed weapon,
mr. Setrakian.

15:04.871 --> 15:08.006
And we have strict laws
in new york city.

15:08.008 --> 15:11.676
- I-- it, it is an antique
piece, your honour,

15:11.678 --> 15:15.013
Th-- that I use
for my mobility only.

15:15.015 --> 15:18.049
It is of great
sentimental value, uh,

15:18.051 --> 15:23.021
A family trophy, you might say.
I-- I will have the blade

15:23.023 --> 15:28.026
Removed and melted,
y-- you have my word.

15:30.696 --> 15:33.731
- Trade it for a nice aluminium
cane with a rubber foot.

15:33.733 --> 15:35.767
Case dismissed.

15:35.769 --> 15:39.437
- Thank you, your honour.

15:42.207 --> 15:45.043
- How much of
that was an act?

15:45.045 --> 15:48.046
- Do I know you?
- I'm dr. Nora martinez from

15:48.048 --> 15:51.416
The cdc. We met
at the airport.

15:51.418 --> 15:53.484
Ok I get it.
You're upset.

15:53.486 --> 15:57.722
- You're here because
the bodies have disappeared.

15:57.724 --> 16:01.225
- Do you know where they are?
- I know where they're going.

16:01.227 --> 16:04.929
- Going? Sir, please.
Come with me. Help us.

16:04.931 --> 16:08.800
- Already it may be too late.
- Too late for what?

16:08.802 --> 16:11.302
What was in
that coffin?

16:11.304 --> 16:15.073
- A thing of enormous power
and terrible will.

16:15.075 --> 16:18.977
A will to devour the world
and swallow the light.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.112
- Is the military
covering it up?

16:21.114 --> 16:23.414
- Do not be so easily
distracted.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.783
He thrives on human
self-interest

16:25.785 --> 16:27.852
And bureaucratic
complacency.

16:27.854 --> 16:30.955
You and dr. Goodweather,

16:30.957 --> 16:33.324
You think that
being good is enough?

16:33.326 --> 16:37.261
Being good means nothing,
unless you are willing to do

16:37.263 --> 16:40.264
What needs to be done,
when it needs to be done.

16:40.266 --> 16:43.267
- Ok then tell me.
What needs to be done?

16:43.269 --> 16:46.804
- You have a complete
passenger manifest with you?

16:46.806 --> 16:48.506
- Not right here, why?

16:48.508 --> 16:51.976
- Because you need
to find every last passenger

16:51.978 --> 16:55.346
And destroy the bodies
and anyone in contact with them.

16:58.283 --> 17:01.519
This is pointless.
You're not ready.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.721
- Explain to my why,
if they're already dead,

17:03.723 --> 17:06.357
We need to
destroy the bodies?

17:06.359 --> 17:08.960
- Until you are willing to do
what needs to be done,

17:08.962 --> 17:12.563
You're of
no use to me.

17:18.504 --> 17:20.805
- I have a few questions
for you, zachary.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.473
And it's important
that you understand

17:22.475 --> 17:25.476
That there are no right
or wrong answers.

17:25.478 --> 17:27.678
The court will make
all final determinations

17:27.680 --> 17:30.982
But your input
is important.

17:30.984 --> 17:36.320
Zachary, what do you think
would be the best solution

17:36.322 --> 17:41.659
For your mom and dad, regarding
custody and visitation rights?

17:41.661 --> 17:45.096
- Well, I guess I
think that...

17:45.098 --> 17:47.532
I know that they both want
what's best for me.

17:47.534 --> 17:51.302
- What do you think would be
best for you?

17:57.009 --> 17:59.010
- I feel like,
if my dad could visit

17:59.012 --> 18:02.046
Like one or
two weekends a month,

18:02.048 --> 18:04.215
That would be
really good.

18:04.217 --> 18:07.085
Because he has a really
important job, and this way

18:07.087 --> 18:09.454
He wouldn't be too stressed
about being late or having

18:09.456 --> 18:11.522
Something come up.
- Um excuse me, your honour,

18:11.524 --> 18:13.858
I think there's been a mistake.
I think ah, what he means

18:13.860 --> 18:15.626
To say is that...

18:15.628 --> 18:19.030
Joint custody would be--
- dr. Goodweather, you need--

18:19.032 --> 18:21.532
- No, no. It's the way
you asked the question,

18:21.534 --> 18:24.068
So just, ask it again.
- Dr. Goodweather!

18:24.070 --> 18:26.437
- I want what's best
for my dad, that's all.

18:44.056 --> 18:47.225
- Are you good?
- Yeah, I'm ok.

18:48.961 --> 18:53.197
- Just, give me
a second, ok?

18:56.401 --> 18:59.337
- Hey...

18:59.339 --> 19:03.307
Are you ok?

19:06.912 --> 19:09.747
- How could zack not know
he's the most important thing

19:09.749 --> 19:12.183
In the world to me?

19:17.289 --> 19:20.591
- Telling him is one thing.
Showing it, proving it -

19:20.593 --> 19:24.595
It's the little things, day in,
day out - that's everything.

19:24.597 --> 19:31.035
You can still have that, eph.
Zack needs it.

19:31.037 --> 19:33.104
Regardless of the ruling
the judge imposed.

19:33.106 --> 19:35.106
Anytime you want
to see him,

19:35.108 --> 19:37.341
So long as you give me
some notice.

19:38.977 --> 19:43.114
- Oh you're loving this, huh?
You take zack away from me.

19:43.116 --> 19:46.184
I never thought
you'd be one to gloat.

19:46.186 --> 19:48.452
- You coached zack!
You tried to coerce him

19:48.454 --> 19:51.455
Into say what you wanted.
- I love my son and I will do

19:51.457 --> 19:53.691
Anything for him.
- It wasn't enough that he had

19:53.693 --> 19:55.826
To get up there and choose
between his mother and father?

19:55.828 --> 19:58.462
- I never asked him to choose.
- He spoke from his heart

19:58.464 --> 20:01.666
In there and he did what he
thought was best for you, eph.

20:01.668 --> 20:05.203
Not him. You.

20:14.846 --> 20:14.979
♪

20:19.484 --> 20:21.485
- Hold up, hold up,
hold up!

20:21.487 --> 20:25.356
Ears, guys. Check it out.
Hold on.

20:25.358 --> 20:27.892
- How 'bout another
go at it?

20:29.828 --> 20:32.597
- It's not gonna
happen today.

20:32.599 --> 20:35.366
- Between that airplane thing,
and you taking a bite

20:35.368 --> 20:39.670
Outta that girl,
your downloads are up ten-fold.

20:39.672 --> 20:42.907
And the youtube video
has over 2 million views.

20:44.676 --> 20:48.512
We just need you focused.
Timing is everything, gabe.

20:48.514 --> 20:50.514
(sighs)
- your cash machine has a cold.

20:50.516 --> 20:56.787
Flu or something.
No voice, no concert.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.531
(knocking)

21:09.868 --> 21:11.936
- Hello?

21:14.206 --> 21:16.674
Mr. Arnot?

21:26.785 --> 21:30.821
It's dr. Goodweather from
the centres for disease control.

21:53.945 --> 21:56.013
Mr. Arnot?

22:11.997 --> 22:14.065
(water dripping)

22:33.151 --> 22:36.120
(sound of door closing)

22:36.122 --> 22:38.522
(phone rings)

22:43.462 --> 22:46.297
- Hey, nora. Have any of the
personal effects of the deceased

22:46.299 --> 22:48.799
Been returned to the next
of kin, by any chance?

22:48.801 --> 22:52.870
What? What! When?
Ok, I'm on my way.

23:17.929 --> 23:20.164
- This thing was on her pillow.
When she woke up,

23:20.166 --> 23:22.533
Bit her in the face.
- Hm.

23:22.535 --> 23:26.170
- I want this rat
found and killed.

23:26.172 --> 23:28.572
- I'm not here
to rehabilitate it.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.574
- Can we speed
this up, then?

23:30.576 --> 23:34.512
This regis air fiasco's
crushing my portfolio.

23:34.514 --> 23:36.514
Market opened down 600 points,
we're already into

23:36.516 --> 23:38.516
Program selling, my phone's
blowing up and I'm stuck here

23:38.518 --> 23:41.419
Waiting on you.
- Ah.

23:43.588 --> 23:45.923
- Scary, huh, hun?
- Yes.

23:45.925 --> 23:49.794
- Yeah. Seven times
I've been bitten already

23:49.796 --> 23:53.864
And I know it
doesn't tickle, eh?

23:53.866 --> 23:55.900
You know - rats,
they have bad eyes

23:55.902 --> 23:58.402
But a very keen sense
of smell and taste.

23:58.404 --> 24:01.539
That's why they usually bite
children around the mouth.

24:01.541 --> 24:07.478
Because that's where the food
smell is, you understand?

24:07.480 --> 24:11.115
You stick right here, I'll be
right back. Yeah? Alright.

24:36.741 --> 24:38.709
(door slams)
(russian expletives)

24:42.180 --> 24:45.316
(whistling)
- here, hold this.

24:45.318 --> 24:47.184
- No, I don't--
I don't want this.

24:47.186 --> 24:51.989
What is that?
- Anesthetic.

24:53.758 --> 24:57.027
Cubans, huh?
Cohiba maduro 5's.

24:57.029 --> 25:01.999
Like smoking coffee and cream.
50 bucks a piece though, eh?

25:02.001 --> 25:07.605
You know a customer of mine,
he gave me one of those once.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.573
(squeaking from bag)

25:12.010 --> 25:16.180
You know who else
likes cigars? Do you?

25:16.182 --> 25:22.686
Rats. This neighbourhood was
still a slum in 1931, yeah.

25:22.688 --> 25:26.123
Put up this building and
knocked down a cigar factory.

25:26.125 --> 25:28.893
And they built right
over the original foundation.

25:28.895 --> 25:32.129
You paid what?
14 and a quarter million

25:32.131 --> 25:34.031
For this six
bedroom duplex?

25:34.033 --> 25:37.902
It's on zillow. This place has
changed hands three times

25:37.904 --> 25:40.371
In the past seven years
and now you know why.

25:40.373 --> 25:42.172
Alright!

25:42.174 --> 25:48.212
Hey hun, no more eating in bed,
alright? Is that a deal?

25:48.214 --> 25:53.784
- Deal.
- Alright. Have a nice day.

26:24.282 --> 26:26.817
(squeaking)

26:36.461 --> 26:38.829
- Sylvia?

26:42.300 --> 26:45.703
- Hey, that was quick.
- Hey.

26:45.705 --> 26:48.138
- You got my text?
- What text?

26:48.140 --> 26:53.110
- Stanford called.
There was a clerical error.

26:53.112 --> 26:58.382
They are accepting me
into the drug trial.

26:58.384 --> 27:01.952
I'm one of
the lucky 100.

27:03.321 --> 27:07.157
- That's great.
- You were right.

27:07.159 --> 27:09.627
You said never
give up hope

27:09.629 --> 27:16.066
And good things happen
to good people, right? Right?

27:25.243 --> 27:27.945
(growling)

27:27.947 --> 27:29.980
(louder)

27:36.521 --> 27:38.389
(growling)

27:41.259 --> 27:43.293
(barking)

27:43.295 --> 27:45.929
(goes quiet)

28:02.280 --> 28:04.381
- (whisper): <i>Ansel... Drink.</i>

28:13.658 --> 28:16.860
(thumping sound)

28:19.998 --> 28:22.232
- (whisper): <i>Ansel... Drink.</i>

28:22.234 --> 28:24.735
<i>Ansel</i> ...

29:03.675 --> 29:05.676
So pre-tour jitters, huh?
I get that, totally.

29:05.678 --> 29:09.213
Tranquilizers'll take
the edge off nicely.

29:09.215 --> 29:11.615
You've heard of
the "morning after" pill?

29:11.617 --> 29:14.084
Well klonopin is
the "night before" pill.

29:14.086 --> 29:18.522
- I'm hearing things, doc.
Strange things.

29:18.524 --> 29:21.225
- Voices, right? Get that too.
- One voice, it's calling

29:21.227 --> 29:23.127
My name. A distant pounding...
- Mmhm. Yep.

29:23.129 --> 29:26.363
- I can't focus.
- Alrighty, all over that.

29:26.365 --> 29:29.233
And we'll throw a little
adderall in there to help you

29:29.235 --> 29:31.969
Remember those lyrics, eh?

29:31.971 --> 29:35.973
Alrighty, any other
"performance" related issues?

29:35.975 --> 29:38.609
- Well, now that you
mention it.

29:38.611 --> 29:42.146
- Agh! Oh.
(clears throat)

29:42.148 --> 29:44.715
Yeah, that does not...
Look good.

29:44.717 --> 29:46.550
What I need for you
to do right now

29:46.552 --> 29:48.819
Is to have somebody drive you
to the nearest hospital.

29:48.821 --> 29:51.388
And I mean like,
yesterday.

29:53.057 --> 29:55.159
- And what have these pictures
up on gawker 10 minutes later?

29:55.161 --> 29:58.495
No way, doc.
You need to do something.

29:58.497 --> 30:01.064
- No, we are
way beyond that.

30:01.066 --> 30:04.001
This is so out
of my bandwidth.

30:04.003 --> 30:07.104
Look, I know a urologist
who might be persuaded

30:07.106 --> 30:09.640
To make an
emergency house-call.

30:09.642 --> 30:12.342
Trust me,
she's very discreet.

30:26.424 --> 30:28.425
(rings bell)

30:29.761 --> 30:32.062
- Next time,
challenge me.

30:34.666 --> 30:37.367
- Yes, very good.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.970
Were all the names here?
- Every damn passenger.

30:39.972 --> 30:42.673
You want their
social security numbers?

30:42.675 --> 30:45.275
Email passwords?
Facebook? Twitter?

30:45.277 --> 30:48.812
Whatever you want,
I can get it.

30:48.814 --> 30:54.718
- And here's your video-gaming
waste of time.

30:54.720 --> 30:57.221
- Why do you want
that list anyway?

30:57.223 --> 31:02.059
- I'm going to visit
their families. Pay my respects.

31:14.405 --> 31:17.174
- This speed of progression
is medically impossible.

31:17.176 --> 31:19.309
We need to get him into surgery,
find out what's happening

31:19.311 --> 31:21.211
Inside him right now.
- We'll prep him right here.

31:21.213 --> 31:23.981
We're getting the operating room
ready. It won't be long.

31:23.983 --> 31:26.884

Who's here?

32:04.522 --> 32:06.590

32:09.394 --> 32:11.194

- Hey guys, sorry.

37:53.639 --> 37:55.705
- Where they hell have you been?
We've been calling you.

37:55.707 --> 37:58.275
We can't find any of the other
3 survivors or even gary arnot.

37:58.277 --> 38:00.543
Redfern's going into
emergency surgery.

38:00.545 --> 38:02.946
- Jim, what's
the matter?

38:02.948 --> 38:07.450
- Ah. You know the new, um,
monoclonal antibody trial

38:07.452 --> 38:10.887
They're doing at stanford?
They accepted sylvia, after all.

38:10.889 --> 38:14.557
- Finally, some good news.
- You said she didn't.

38:14.559 --> 38:17.394
- I-- they must have made some
sort of clerical mistake

38:17.396 --> 38:19.896
Or something - I don't know.
But, it's insane, she's in.

38:19.898 --> 38:22.232
- That's great.

38:22.234 --> 38:24.067
- Intercom: <i>Paging</i>
<i>dr. Goodweather.</i>

38:24.069 --> 38:26.903
<i>Dr. Goodweather</i>
<i>to the iso unit, stat.</i>

38:32.476 --> 38:35.111
- Dr. Goodweather.
Your patient... He's gone.

38:35.113 --> 38:37.180
- He coded?
- No, he's gone.

38:37.182 --> 38:39.749
- He was ready for
surgery, I left

38:39.751 --> 38:43.453
To make final preparations...
He was only alone for a minute.

38:43.455 --> 38:45.989
- Alright, spread out.
He's still here somewhere,

38:45.991 --> 38:49.326
So is whoever took him. Jim,
conference us in on our phones.

38:51.595 --> 38:53.596
- Hey! Hey, did you see
a patient come by here

38:53.598 --> 38:55.832
About five minutes ago?
Probably pushing a wheelchair,

38:55.834 --> 38:57.634
Bald, very sick?

38:57.636 --> 39:00.303
- Nothing here.
No sign of him.

39:00.305 --> 39:02.772
- Is anybody up high?
Anybody got a view?

39:04.108 --> 39:07.744
- Nothing, I don't see anything.
- Jim: [I'm checking downstairs]

39:12.783 --> 39:15.719
- Jim, where are you?
- In the basement.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.196
(eating sounds)

39:26.198 --> 39:28.865
Ok I found him.
He's in the kitchen.

39:28.867 --> 39:34.371
The kitchen in the basement,
eph, you got--, eph?

39:47.051 --> 39:50.253
Captain redfern?

39:50.255 --> 39:52.555
(growling)

39:57.061 --> 39:58.895
- (whisper): <i>Jim...</i>

40:00.231 --> 40:02.432
- Jim.

40:03.501 --> 40:05.735
- Captain redfern.

40:16.747 --> 40:18.848
- Jim?

40:18.850 --> 40:22.018
- Eph!
- Doyle, what are you doing?

40:22.020 --> 40:24.654
- Stay away from him.

40:36.066 --> 40:39.602
- Ah! Oh!
- Ah!

40:48.712 --> 40:50.780
- Huh!

40:53.417 --> 40:55.985
(gasping)

41:13.471 --> 41:15.905
- Stop it!
- Alright!

41:21.345 --> 41:24.647
- Oh god.
