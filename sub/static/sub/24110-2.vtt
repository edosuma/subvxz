Previously onInstinct:

00:02.959 --> 00:04.526
Welcome to
Abnormal Behavioral Analysis.

00:04.569 --> 00:06.223
My name is
Professor Dylan Reinhart.

00:06.267 --> 00:07.311
You read my book?

00:07.355 --> 00:08.138
What's it about?

00:08.182 --> 00:09.661
Abnormal behavior.

00:09.705 --> 00:12.577
You need to focus
on getting yourself

00:12.621 --> 00:14.144
and this book into better shape.

00:14.188 --> 00:15.493
It's funny you should say that.

00:15.537 --> 00:17.147
A cop came to my class today.

00:17.191 --> 00:18.496
Detective Elizabeth
Needham, NYPD.

00:18.540 --> 00:19.889
Dino Moretti was found

00:19.932 --> 00:21.978
dead in a nightclub in
the Meatpacking District.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.675
Before Dino died, the
killer sent your book

00:23.719 --> 00:25.025
to the homicide
division.

00:25.068 --> 00:27.027
I want to go see a friend
who may be able to help.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.985
Great. I'll drive.He works undercover.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.074
You think it's someone
who found out you're CIA?

00:31.118 --> 00:33.816
LIZZIE:
Wait. Andy is your husband?

00:33.859 --> 00:35.296
If the teaching thing
gets boring,

00:35.339 --> 00:37.515
I could use a partner
in any form I can get.

00:37.559 --> 00:38.777
Maybe you should
have been a cop.

00:41.432 --> 00:43.434
♪

00:52.313 --> 00:54.271
MAN:
Nora.

00:54.315 --> 00:55.272
Oh.

00:55.316 --> 00:56.882
This is a surprise.

00:56.926 --> 00:59.015
Sebastian, how are you?

00:59.059 --> 01:00.495
Selena still away?

01:00.538 --> 01:02.192
Yeah, she gets home
tomorrow.

01:02.236 --> 01:03.889
Um, come in.
I'll put some coffee on.

01:03.933 --> 01:06.022
No, that's okay.
I-I wanted to deliver this.

01:06.066 --> 01:09.417
It's a new
partnership proposal.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.550
Well, I'm happy to
take a look at it,

01:12.594 --> 01:14.335
but I... I really
can't extend

01:14.378 --> 01:16.554
your repayment
deadline again.

01:17.642 --> 01:19.775
Look, I know
how vulnerable

01:19.818 --> 01:22.517
things are right now
for you and Roman.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.475
What, you mean in our marriage

01:24.519 --> 01:26.825
or in the fact that we're
losing our business to you?

01:26.869 --> 01:28.392
Both.

01:28.436 --> 01:30.046
And I'm... I'm-I'm really sorry,

01:30.090 --> 01:32.570
but that's the contract
we signed.

01:32.614 --> 01:34.137
Well, I thought I'd

01:34.181 --> 01:36.052
give it one last shot, but...

01:36.096 --> 01:37.358
no, I get it.

01:37.401 --> 01:40.448
We were so desperate
for capital,

01:40.491 --> 01:42.276
we signed a deal with the devil.

01:42.319 --> 01:46.149
:
Nora, I am not the devil.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.282
I... I love your restaurant.

01:48.325 --> 01:50.806
And you won't be satisfied
until it's yours.

02:21.489 --> 02:23.447
Hey, sweetheart.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.232
You boarding?
Not yet.

02:25.275 --> 02:27.190
But don't worry,
I'll be home soon.

02:27.234 --> 02:28.452
Really

02:28.496 --> 02:31.151
Good night, honey.

02:44.947 --> 02:47.297
DYLAN: When thinking
about abnormal behavior,

02:47.341 --> 02:51.301
ask yourself who gets to define
what "abnormal" means.

02:51.345 --> 02:55.131
Abnormal is a departure
from the norm.

02:55.175 --> 02:58.700
People who are different,
like Michelangelo or Lady Gaga,

02:58.743 --> 03:00.528
must be abnormal,

03:00.571 --> 03:03.444
so clearly normal is boring.

03:06.577 --> 03:11.365
Sometimes normal can mean
not thinking, just doing.

03:11.408 --> 03:15.369
Sometimes people get
so focused on the spoken word

03:15.412 --> 03:17.414
that they totally miss
what is going on

03:17.458 --> 03:19.416
in front of their very eyes.

03:19.460 --> 03:20.548
Cory, what are you doing?

03:20.591 --> 03:22.680
Taking notes.
Mm-hmm.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.029
So, what did I just say?

03:24.073 --> 03:25.988
Nope, don't look.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.251
Today we are going to try
something really abnormal

03:28.295 --> 03:30.253
for students,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.429
We're gonna try and listen
without taking notes.

03:32.473 --> 03:35.650
Does anyone have a boyfriend
or a girlfriend?

03:35.693 --> 03:38.914
Mm-hmm, so when you're out
in the moonlight

03:38.957 --> 03:40.655
or the light of your devices

03:40.698 --> 03:42.352
and you're listening
to your beloved pour out

03:42.396 --> 03:44.702
their heart and souls to you,
do you take notes?

03:44.746 --> 03:46.791
STUDENTS: No.No, of course you don't.

03:46.835 --> 03:49.794
Because watching someone's eyes
or affect

03:49.838 --> 03:53.842
can increase the brain's ability
to process words.

03:53.885 --> 03:56.497
And avoid a nasty breakup.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.720
Cory, you're gonna have to go.

04:04.722 --> 04:06.724
Professor Reinhart,
I'm really sorry.

04:13.992 --> 04:15.690
DYLAN:
Cory.

04:15.733 --> 04:19.607
My guess is you won't soon
forget this experience.

04:19.650 --> 04:21.391
Is that true?

04:21.435 --> 04:23.393
Yes, Professor.

04:23.437 --> 04:27.136
And you didn't write down
a single word about it.

04:27.179 --> 04:28.920
Come on back to your seat.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.618
Give the kid a hand.

04:46.329 --> 04:48.070
I've never seen
anything like it.

04:48.113 --> 04:50.246
It is strange.

04:50.290 --> 04:51.726
JASMINE:
Lizzie.

04:51.769 --> 04:53.293
Hey, Lieutenant.

04:53.336 --> 04:54.729
What's this about?

04:54.772 --> 04:56.600
So, uh...

04:56.644 --> 04:58.602
vic's name is
Sebastian Trevor.

04:58.646 --> 05:00.300
43, venture capitalist.

05:00.343 --> 05:02.650
His widow is flying
back from Bogotá,

05:02.693 --> 05:04.173
where she was
visiting family.

05:04.216 --> 05:06.958
Lot of weirdo going on here,
but likely cause of death

05:07.002 --> 05:09.483
is slow bleed from perhaps
a pronged projectile.

05:09.526 --> 05:10.875
No weapon found.

05:10.919 --> 05:12.921
All good to know,
but I'm asking--

05:12.964 --> 05:14.531
what are you doing here?

05:14.575 --> 05:16.838
It's my case. I'm up.

05:16.881 --> 05:18.056
You're on medical leave.

05:18.100 --> 05:19.493
You got shot on duty.
Go home.

05:19.536 --> 05:20.842
Two weeks ago.

05:20.885 --> 05:21.973
I'm cured early.

05:22.017 --> 05:23.758
Doc agreed. This one's mine.

05:23.801 --> 05:25.847
Well, I'll call Sosa
to partner.

05:25.890 --> 05:27.675
He's on a case.

05:27.718 --> 05:28.850
Fucci, then.

05:28.893 --> 05:31.505
With his
weak stomach, no way.

05:31.548 --> 05:34.334
You do know that I'm your boss?

05:34.377 --> 05:35.552
And dearest friend.

05:36.597 --> 05:37.902
If you are cured,

05:37.946 --> 05:39.774
then it's time for you
to know--

05:39.817 --> 05:42.124
you will have a partner
on this case.

05:42.167 --> 05:43.995
Now, I cut you slack
because of Charlie...

05:44.039 --> 05:45.606
Jas...No, tough girl.

05:45.649 --> 05:46.781
We're getting real.

05:46.824 --> 05:50.306
I am so sorry Charlie died,

05:50.350 --> 05:52.221
but you can't
work alone anymore.

05:52.264 --> 05:54.702
You need a partner. So...

05:54.745 --> 05:56.530
how about Dylan Reinhart?

05:56.573 --> 05:57.618
The professor?

05:57.661 --> 05:58.532
No, he's too busy,

05:58.575 --> 06:00.098
not interested,
not a cop.

06:00.142 --> 06:02.405
Yeah, but didn't he say
that if you ever had

06:02.449 --> 06:04.625
a special case that spoke
to his expertise...?

06:04.668 --> 06:06.235
Yeah, he was just being polite.

06:06.278 --> 06:08.803
Wait, this murder--
highly ritualized,

06:08.846 --> 06:10.631
the work of a sick mind.

06:10.674 --> 06:12.720
It's right up his alley.

06:12.763 --> 06:13.982
Call him.

06:14.025 --> 06:16.376
I'll get off your back.

06:25.341 --> 06:26.864
Oh, Detective Needham.

06:26.908 --> 06:28.736
Hey. Privacy.

06:28.779 --> 06:30.607
:
Darling...

06:30.651 --> 06:32.087
I'm your book editor.

06:32.130 --> 06:33.828
You owe me another best seller.

06:33.871 --> 06:35.699
You have no right to privacy.

06:35.743 --> 06:37.701
And I can't believe
you got here on time.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.529
And why don't you
want to talk to her?

06:42.489 --> 06:43.881
Because I'm meeting
with you.

06:43.925 --> 06:46.014
We have nothing to talk about

06:46.057 --> 06:48.059
since you've turned your
back on your next book.

06:48.103 --> 06:50.758
I have not turned my back.

06:50.801 --> 06:55.284
I just had second thoughts
about working with the NYPD.

06:55.327 --> 06:59.027
Dylan, Freaks--
that was a best seller

06:59.070 --> 07:01.333
because people really love

07:01.377 --> 07:04.424
the Dylan Reinhart take
on abnormal behavior.

07:04.467 --> 07:07.644
Follow it up by the
Dylan Reinhart take

07:07.688 --> 07:09.385
on working
with the NYPD.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.952
So I suppose my third book

07:10.995 --> 07:13.781
will be the Dylan Reinhart take
on world peace?

07:13.824 --> 07:15.478
Well, no, 'cause there'll be
no third book

07:15.522 --> 07:17.132
if we can't sell the second one.

07:17.175 --> 07:19.526
See? You know,
people really

07:19.569 --> 07:23.051
love your... your
"adrenaline junkie" thing.

07:23.094 --> 07:24.966
I have a normal life now.

07:25.009 --> 07:27.403
Teaching and Andy.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.753
I didn't want to upend all that.

07:29.797 --> 07:32.452
You know, she just might be
calling to say, "Hey..."

07:35.542 --> 07:37.718
Hey... Detective.

07:42.244 --> 07:44.812
Oh. Prof... uh...

07:44.855 --> 07:45.856
Professor Reinhart.

07:45.900 --> 07:47.815
Thank you for coming.
Ah.

07:47.858 --> 07:50.644
It's good to see you back at
work so soon, Detective Needham.

07:50.687 --> 07:52.428
Please call me Lizzie.
And I appreciate you

07:52.472 --> 07:53.821
taking my call.My pleasure.

07:53.864 --> 07:55.823
And please call me Dr. Reinhart.

07:55.866 --> 07:56.954
Oh.

07:56.998 --> 07:58.042
Kidding.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.393
Call me Dylan.
Just Dylan, remember?
Okay.

08:01.437 --> 08:02.569
Okay. Dylan.

08:02.612 --> 08:03.700
Thank you for coming so quickly.

08:03.744 --> 08:05.485
I-I know how busy you are.Sure.

08:05.528 --> 08:09.837
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry I changed my mind.

08:09.880 --> 08:12.492
My life is so incredibly busy
at the moment, and I just...

08:12.535 --> 08:13.754
Totally understand.
You're not a cop.

08:13.797 --> 08:15.582
But you did say
that if I ever

08:15.625 --> 08:17.192
had a case that spoke
to your expertise...

08:17.235 --> 08:18.889
I will totally weigh in.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.283
Great. So, I just need
a couple hours of your time

08:21.326 --> 08:22.719
to help me profile a killer.

08:22.763 --> 08:24.199
Body's still here?

08:24.242 --> 08:26.157
Let's do it.

08:28.943 --> 08:30.640
Thanks.

08:32.207 --> 08:35.210
Head shaving
in a tonsure pattern,

08:35.253 --> 08:36.777
body displayed rack-like,

08:36.820 --> 08:40.128
so maybe an historic
or mythological fixation.

08:40.171 --> 08:41.608
Definitely punishment.

08:41.651 --> 08:43.697
Was the murder weapon an arrow?

08:43.740 --> 08:46.351
Possibly.
This shard was found.

08:46.395 --> 08:48.745
Could be part
of the weapon.Get it carbon-dated.

08:48.789 --> 08:51.182
And test the substance
in the mouth.

08:51.226 --> 08:52.401
Already happening.

08:52.444 --> 08:53.620
My guess is bread.

08:53.663 --> 08:55.404
Bread? Don't touch.

08:55.447 --> 08:56.927
Or taste.

08:56.971 --> 08:58.450
Smell's okay?

08:59.974 --> 09:01.976
This is gonna take more
than a few hours.

09:02.019 --> 09:03.934
But you can help?

09:05.153 --> 09:07.024
Oh, I'm in.

09:12.682 --> 09:14.815
♪

09:20.168 --> 09:22.736
Again, I am so sorry
for your loss.

09:22.779 --> 09:25.652
And we are as anxious as you
to catch your husband's killer.

09:25.695 --> 09:27.741
If you could just answer
a few questions for me...

09:27.784 --> 09:31.266
Selena! Oh, my God,
I just got your message.

09:31.309 --> 09:32.528
Honey.
Oh, Nora!

09:32.572 --> 09:34.138
SELENA: What am
I going to do?

09:34.182 --> 09:35.879
Oh, honey.

09:35.923 --> 09:37.707
Oh, I'm-I'm sorry.

09:37.751 --> 09:39.579
I'm-I'm Selena's friend,
Nora Cecchino.

09:39.622 --> 09:40.971
I'm sorry to
interrupt.

09:41.015 --> 09:42.712
SELENA:
Oh, Nora, this wasn't

09:42.756 --> 09:43.844
how it was supposed
to happen.

09:43.887 --> 09:45.410
Oh, honey, I know.

09:45.454 --> 09:46.847
I know.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.500
SELENA: And now the police
are questioning me.

09:48.544 --> 09:50.633
Oh, it's just procedure.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.855
You know, my friend has just
suffered a terrible loss.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.726
I think she needs
some time.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.772
Any chance you
could do this later?

09:58.815 --> 10:00.295
Sure.

10:00.338 --> 10:02.297
Honey...

10:02.340 --> 10:03.690
NORA:
My God.

10:05.169 --> 10:06.867
LIZZIE:
Lab results came back.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.695
It was bread in
the vic's mouth.

10:08.738 --> 10:09.870
How'd you know?

10:09.913 --> 10:11.654
Bread could be
a twisted form of penitence

10:11.698 --> 10:13.221
in the killer's mind.

10:13.264 --> 10:16.224
Did you know that last rites
only began in the Middle Ages?

10:16.267 --> 10:18.443
I did not know.
Now I do.

10:18.487 --> 10:20.620
That would work
with the monk's haircut

10:20.663 --> 10:22.360
and the ritualized display.Huh.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.362
And, presumably, as a new widow,

10:24.406 --> 10:25.668
Selena is set
to inherit a fortune.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.409
Yeah, of course,
and she could have

10:27.452 --> 10:29.541
hired someone to do the
job, but here's a twist:

10:29.585 --> 10:32.675
Nora Cecchino isn't just
Selena's dear friend.

10:32.719 --> 10:34.634
Legal papers at
the residence show

10:34.677 --> 10:36.810
that Nora and her
husband Roman Cecchino

10:36.853 --> 10:39.639
were deeply in debt to Trevor.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.729
When you said "a late lunch"...

10:42.772 --> 10:44.644
Uh...

10:44.687 --> 10:46.384
bacon cheeseburger
and fries, please, and...

10:46.428 --> 10:48.691
Um...
it's my first time here.

10:48.735 --> 10:49.823
I need a minute.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.738
Burgers are really good.

10:51.781 --> 10:55.132
Wait. Are the Cecchinos
the Cecchinos

10:55.176 --> 10:56.830
of Cecchino's Restaurant,
one of the

10:56.873 --> 10:58.483
hardest-to-get reservations
in all of Manhattan?

10:58.527 --> 10:59.789
Yeah, Cecchino's.

10:59.833 --> 11:01.182
Farm to table,
very popular spot.

11:01.225 --> 11:03.880
And also cash poor
and looking to expand.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.490
Just, uh, get a burger.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.710
Fast food slows down the brain.

11:09.886 --> 11:12.062
Most new restaurants
don't turn a profit right away.

11:12.106 --> 11:14.108
You know, more success,
more pressure.

11:14.151 --> 11:16.850
He'll have a burger.

11:16.893 --> 11:18.678
So, Trevor also drafted
a deadline for repayment

11:18.721 --> 11:20.549
into the deal.
It's next week.

11:20.592 --> 11:22.682
If the Cecchinos were unable
to return the investment,

11:22.725 --> 11:24.031
he stood to acquire
their restaurant

11:24.074 --> 11:25.728
and deed to their 40-acre farm.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.121
Wow.

11:27.164 --> 11:28.731
MAN:
Here you go.

11:28.775 --> 11:29.732
Oh, thanks.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.516
Thank you.
You can keep the change.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.953
Shouldn't we be going
to Cecchino's now?

11:32.996 --> 11:35.433
Yeah, we are. Next stop.

11:36.783 --> 11:39.524
They why are we eating
from a truck?

11:41.526 --> 11:42.745
MAN:
Please, Detectives, this way.

11:42.789 --> 11:44.094
We are a little slammed today.

11:44.138 --> 11:45.879
Our hostess didn't show,
but, um,

11:45.922 --> 11:47.184
we have someone else coming in.

11:47.228 --> 11:48.708
Oh, no worries, Mr. Cecchino.

11:48.751 --> 11:50.274
What a place.Thank you.

11:50.318 --> 11:52.886
Please, um...

11:52.929 --> 11:55.323
We can't believe
this tragedy.

11:55.366 --> 11:57.760
Are you sure
it was foul play?

11:57.804 --> 11:59.414
Oh, yes. The cause
of death was...

11:59.457 --> 12:01.068
Oh, we're still investigating.

12:01.111 --> 12:03.548
Oh. Uh, forgive me.

12:08.466 --> 12:11.078
We do not broadcast
the details.

12:11.121 --> 12:13.167
Being honest engenders trust.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.908
He could be a suspect.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.866
Just saying.

12:16.910 --> 12:19.042
So sorry. Uh...

12:19.086 --> 12:21.175
Can I offer you anything
from today's menu?

12:21.218 --> 12:23.612
Yes, please.Oh, no, thank you.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.745
LIZZIE:
So you and your wife are owners,

12:25.788 --> 12:27.485
but Trevor provided
the financing.

12:27.529 --> 12:30.619
Yes, and Trevor could drive
a tough bargain.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.055
Uh, but it was his money.

12:32.099 --> 12:36.190
He was positioned
to take over the farm.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.888
Um...

12:38.932 --> 12:40.716
He knew we wanted to grow.

12:40.760 --> 12:44.981
I... I think he would have
come through for us in the end.

12:45.025 --> 12:48.289
I have a question,
Mr. Cecchino.

12:48.332 --> 12:50.900
Is there basil
in this béarnaise sauce?

12:50.944 --> 12:52.684
I'll, um...

12:52.728 --> 12:54.817
I'll get you the expert
who can answer that.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.559
What?

12:57.602 --> 12:59.517
Accepting gifts can
be a slippery slope.

12:59.561 --> 13:00.954
I draw a bright line.

13:00.997 --> 13:02.390
Even a free coffee
can be misconstrued

13:02.433 --> 13:03.957
as a quid pro quo
for a cop.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.089
Good thing I'm not a cop.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.831
Detectives, this is
Haley, our chef.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.180
Mmm. Love your food.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.921
Love that you
love my food.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.618
Without Haley,
I'd still be a farmer,

13:13.662 --> 13:15.142
a wannabe restaurateur.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.143
She's Cecchino's
secret weapon.

13:16.186 --> 13:17.666
I...MAN: Roman.

13:17.709 --> 13:20.190
Uh, I should say hello to him.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.018
Oh, go ahead.

13:22.062 --> 13:24.847
So, do you know
Sebastian Trevor?

13:24.891 --> 13:26.849
Our sugar daddy? Sure.

13:26.893 --> 13:28.633
Threw his weight around.

13:28.677 --> 13:30.679
Endless string of
menu suggestions from the '90s.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.637
Chewed with his
mouth open.

13:32.681 --> 13:33.638
Not a fan.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.990
I have to get back.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.818
This excellent food
won't cook itself.

13:39.731 --> 13:40.950
We'll be in touch.

13:40.994 --> 13:41.995
Thanks.

13:43.387 --> 13:44.867
We can pick this up tomorrow.

13:44.911 --> 13:47.000
We'll do better getting them
in sit-down interviews.

13:47.043 --> 13:48.871
And didn't we learn
more about them

13:48.915 --> 13:50.830
by observing them
in their natural habitat?

13:50.873 --> 13:52.919
He is nervous
and eager to please.

13:52.962 --> 13:56.444
HALEY: Not acceptable.

13:56.487 --> 13:58.881
And she is exacting
and gets her own way.Mm-hmm.

13:58.925 --> 14:00.883
We should get
some of this to go.

14:00.927 --> 14:02.580
Mmm. Done.

14:04.931 --> 14:07.020
In the future, we do not stuff

14:07.063 --> 14:08.848
potential evidence
into our pockets.

14:08.891 --> 14:10.893
We're investigating.

14:10.937 --> 14:12.895
:
Ay, ay, ay.

14:15.289 --> 14:17.508
DYLAN:
What are you doing?

14:17.552 --> 14:19.902
Is the honeymoon over No.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.949
Actually, I am making this
your own private study.

14:22.992 --> 14:25.038
I'm moving the piano to give
you more room to catch killers.

14:25.081 --> 14:26.474
I saw how much space

14:26.517 --> 14:27.954
you needed for your last
investigation, so...

14:27.997 --> 14:30.608
But this time, they only need me
for a couple of hours.

14:30.652 --> 14:32.480
Huh. And yet it seemed
to take all day.

14:32.523 --> 14:34.308
You know me too well.Mm-hmm.

14:34.351 --> 14:35.918
But what about your desk?

14:35.962 --> 14:37.615
Well, I have an office
at the bar.

14:37.659 --> 14:39.922
One of the perks
of leaving my law practice--

14:39.966 --> 14:41.054
less work to bring home.

14:41.097 --> 14:42.925
So help me move
this piano,

14:42.969 --> 14:45.101
and tell me about
your new case.

14:45.145 --> 14:49.758
Oh, it's an intriguing mix
of brutality and ritual.

14:49.801 --> 14:51.934
The whole judge,
jury and executioner

14:51.978 --> 14:53.631
implies splitting.A little help?

14:53.675 --> 14:55.807
A... a primitive
defense mechanism,

14:55.851 --> 14:58.941
a rigid sense of good or bad,
all or nothing.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.943
All or nothing?
That sounds like someone I know.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.423
Ah, well, it's true.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.164
But in order to appreciate
the deviant mind,

15:04.207 --> 15:05.861
it helps to be able to recognize

15:05.905 --> 15:07.167
the less extreme forms
of those syndromes

15:07.210 --> 15:08.603
within oneself.

15:08.646 --> 15:10.213
Imagine looking
at others

15:10.257 --> 15:12.259
and seeing either angels
or devils.

15:12.302 --> 15:13.825
Look at you.

15:13.869 --> 15:16.045
All fired up,
excited to save the world.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.525
I love this
part of you.

15:17.568 --> 15:19.962
Which is why I'm
giving you the office.

15:20.006 --> 15:21.485
Now, help me with this piano,
will you,

15:21.529 --> 15:22.834
before I pull something.

15:22.878 --> 15:24.184
LIZZIE:
Turns out our chef

15:24.227 --> 15:26.012
wasn't just too busy
to talk yesterday.

15:26.055 --> 15:27.491
She was hiding a record.

15:27.535 --> 15:29.232
Arrested for assault
two years ago.

15:29.276 --> 15:31.669
She also has a restraining
order against her.

15:31.713 --> 15:33.062
Recent?

15:33.106 --> 15:34.672
Filed last week by
Sebastian Trevor.

15:34.716 --> 15:36.152
Right before his murder.

15:36.196 --> 15:38.720
I wouldn't want to get
on her bad side.

15:46.075 --> 15:47.294
Out of my ear!

16:00.046 --> 16:01.438
Shut up!
That wasn't even fair.

16:01.482 --> 16:02.962
You had a head start.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.138
Rage certainly
fits the profile.

16:05.181 --> 16:07.140
And labile mood swings.

16:07.183 --> 16:08.315
"Labile"?

16:08.358 --> 16:10.099
Oh, it means a sudden
emotional response.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.231
Bull!

16:13.581 --> 16:15.017
Got it.

16:21.850 --> 16:23.547
The restraining order
was bull.

16:23.591 --> 16:24.809
Trevor only filed it
because I threatened

16:24.853 --> 16:26.028
to do the same to him.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.769
What was the problem?

16:27.812 --> 16:30.163
Trevor was one of
those guys who thought

16:30.206 --> 16:33.166
that every woman he met
should submit to his charms,

16:33.209 --> 16:35.603
especially those
he thought he could rescue.

16:35.646 --> 16:36.952
Did he force himself on you?

16:36.996 --> 16:38.388
He was smarter than that.

16:38.432 --> 16:39.737
It was a power thing.

16:39.781 --> 16:42.131
And, uh, what about
your assault charges?

16:42.175 --> 16:43.567
Yeah.

16:43.611 --> 16:46.962
Uh, that was a chef
I worked under coming up.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.182
He didn't want a woman
in his kitchen.

16:49.225 --> 16:51.401
I took his abuse until I didn't.

16:51.445 --> 16:52.794
It was a mistake
to hit him,

16:52.837 --> 16:54.056
but I did
my community service,

16:54.100 --> 16:56.624
and I completed
my anger management therapy.

16:56.667 --> 16:58.800
Also, I'm sober now.
That really helped.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.671
Didn't seem to help much
back there

17:00.715 --> 17:02.195
when you lost your competition.

17:02.238 --> 17:03.631
You should have seen the old me.

17:03.674 --> 17:04.675
You'd have that girl in cuffs.

17:04.719 --> 17:05.676
:
Oh.

17:05.720 --> 17:06.895
If I'm free to go,

17:06.938 --> 17:08.331
this steak needs
to be sliced,

17:08.375 --> 17:09.985
seared and curled
onto butter lettuce

17:10.029 --> 17:11.987
with mango confit
by lunchtime.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.336
You're free to go.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.903
Please don't leave town.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.733
LIZZIE:
Her history is troubling,

17:18.776 --> 17:21.257
and her alibi is weak:
"sleeping in alone."

17:21.301 --> 17:23.085
I could take her in
on reckless endangerment

17:23.129 --> 17:24.695
just for that knife throw.

17:24.739 --> 17:26.741
People change.Yeah.

17:26.784 --> 17:29.613
You should try it someday.
I've changed myself.

17:29.657 --> 17:32.964
Oh. You mean you used to be
a more pompous know

17:33.008 --> 17:34.575
Haley's temper flair
could be consistent

17:34.618 --> 17:36.098
with a borderline personality.

17:36.142 --> 17:37.969
But she's steady now,
and I couldn't goad her.

17:38.013 --> 17:39.623
For a fuller profile,

17:39.667 --> 17:41.364
I'd need to spend
more time with her.

17:41.408 --> 17:43.279
Maybe check out
that mango confit.

17:43.323 --> 17:45.325
I'll take it from here
and be in touch.

17:45.368 --> 17:46.891
Thank you.

17:53.811 --> 17:55.161
Hello, Julian.

17:55.204 --> 17:56.597
Who is it today?

17:56.640 --> 17:58.686
MI6 GDSE?

17:58.729 --> 18:00.296
CIA.

18:00.340 --> 18:01.689
I didn't know you
were still doing

18:01.732 --> 18:03.560
surveillance work for the CIA.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.388
Rather like the old days,
isn't it?

18:05.432 --> 18:07.477
Feeling nostalgic?

18:07.521 --> 18:09.653
Makes me wonder
just how many times

18:09.697 --> 18:13.048
I have to remind you--
I am not a spy anymore.

18:13.092 --> 18:16.486
Right, Professor, author
and local hero.Mm-hmm.

18:16.530 --> 18:20.229
Do you know of any cartels
or international syndicates

18:20.273 --> 18:22.840
that shave their victims' heads?

18:22.884 --> 18:25.060
Man or woman?
Man.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.758
Doubtful.
They prefer to cut deeper.

18:27.802 --> 18:29.673
And how good are your sources
in Colombia?

18:29.717 --> 18:31.936
I have a grieving widow whose
background needs to be checked.

18:31.980 --> 18:34.504
The NYPD isn't on it?As you well know,

18:34.548 --> 18:36.680
the official records don't
always tell the whole story.

18:36.724 --> 18:38.813
Tell me what you need.
I'll see what I can find.

18:38.856 --> 18:41.294
But then I'll owe you one.

18:42.556 --> 18:44.732
Who's keeping score?

18:55.351 --> 18:57.048
I thought I'd been dismissed.

18:57.092 --> 18:59.921
Have I been un-dismissed
so soon?

18:59.964 --> 19:02.271
Or have I inspired you
to enroll?

19:03.838 --> 19:05.840
I rushed the lab report.

19:05.883 --> 19:07.885
The bread is a match.

19:07.929 --> 19:09.322
Same heirloom wheat
as Cecchino's.

19:09.365 --> 19:12.368
And the metal fragment is from
an old Apache arrowhead.

19:12.412 --> 19:14.457
Which means...?

19:14.501 --> 19:16.938
Go on, you can say it.

19:19.897 --> 19:21.247
Your instincts were right.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.857
Mm-hmm.
So...

19:22.900 --> 19:25.947
the metal fragment
is dated back to the 1870s.

19:25.990 --> 19:28.384
Actually, I was hoping
for something older.

19:28.428 --> 19:30.908
A medieval artifact
would pair neatly

19:30.952 --> 19:32.171
with the head
shaving, suggesting

19:32.214 --> 19:33.868
an obsession
with penitence.

19:33.911 --> 19:35.696
Oh, well, scratch that.

19:35.739 --> 19:37.872
Maybe our killer's symbolism
is more personal than historic.

19:37.915 --> 19:39.787
Who has a collection
of 19th century weapons?

19:39.830 --> 19:41.919
Okay, so now you're in
my area of expertise.

19:41.963 --> 19:43.573
There is nothing missing
from the Met,

19:43.617 --> 19:45.793
but guess whose family has
a vintage weapons collection,

19:45.836 --> 19:47.882
and guess who was
a Junior Olympian in archery.

19:47.925 --> 19:50.014
I'll give you a hint--
they're alive in this century.

19:50.058 --> 19:51.973
Nora Cecchino.

19:52.016 --> 19:53.844
You didn't let me guess.

19:53.888 --> 19:56.499
So Cecchino's wife,
co-owner of the restaurant...

19:56.543 --> 19:57.979
And dear friend
of the victim's widow.

19:58.022 --> 20:00.068
Showed up on some CCTV footage
near the scene.

20:00.111 --> 20:01.200
Really?

20:01.243 --> 20:02.853
Their farm is a few miles north.

20:02.897 --> 20:04.072
Wow.

20:04.115 --> 20:06.205
This is a big step forward.

20:06.248 --> 20:08.250
Mm.Not just with the case,

20:08.294 --> 20:10.818
but this almost felt
like teamwork.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.254
Let's go.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.821
Uh...

20:13.864 --> 20:15.692
Oh, oh, I-I'm happy
for you to join,

20:15.736 --> 20:17.477
but please don't
interrupt my interview

20:17.520 --> 20:19.870
with your random
questions.

20:19.914 --> 20:22.960
Okay, maybe just a baby step.

20:31.882 --> 20:33.406
Here you go.
She's a hardy layer.

20:33.449 --> 20:34.624
Oh, oh...
Oh.

20:34.668 --> 20:36.757
Rhode Island red.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.149
Comparable to Faiyumi.

20:38.193 --> 20:39.673
I kept a few in Egypt.

20:39.716 --> 20:41.022
Well, you'll need
at least a pair.

20:41.065 --> 20:42.937
Hens will die of loneliness.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.460
Yeah.NORA: Oh, I'm sorry.

20:44.504 --> 20:46.288
Hello.
Um, you know what, Gwen?

20:46.332 --> 20:47.550
Th-These are actually not

20:47.594 --> 20:48.812
our customers.

20:48.856 --> 20:51.859
Oh. I'm so sorry about that.Got it?

20:51.902 --> 20:54.775
NORA:
Trevor's wife Selena and I
bonded as soon as we first met.

20:54.818 --> 20:56.733
And we promised
we would never

20:56.777 --> 20:59.301
let money interfere
with our friendship.

20:59.345 --> 21:02.522
But now that Selena is
heir to a big fortune,

21:02.565 --> 21:04.872
your friendship
may pay off.

21:04.915 --> 21:06.352
DYLAN:
Your farm is lovely.

21:06.395 --> 21:08.179
That wasn't a question.

21:08.223 --> 21:11.400
NORA:
Yes, it's been in Roman's
family for generations.

21:11.444 --> 21:13.010
And I grew up
right over there.

21:13.054 --> 21:14.142
Hi, honey.

21:14.185 --> 21:15.361
Hey, Mom.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.450
You and Roman,
you were childhood friends?

21:17.493 --> 21:19.103
When we were eight,
we promised

21:19.147 --> 21:20.975
we'd get married.
DYLAN: Oh.

21:21.018 --> 21:23.673
It's both romantic
and a little weird.

21:23.717 --> 21:26.328
But, um, when
we did marry,

21:26.372 --> 21:27.851
we were so in love.

21:27.895 --> 21:30.724
My dream of owning
our own restaurant,

21:30.767 --> 21:32.943
getting the financing,
hiring Haley,

21:32.987 --> 21:35.294
it all came together
like it was meant to be.

21:35.337 --> 21:37.296
Is your marriage over?

21:39.080 --> 21:41.691
You talked about Roman
in the past tense.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.214
You said you were

21:43.258 --> 21:46.000
in love.

21:46.043 --> 21:47.958
Um, that's true, yeah.

21:48.002 --> 21:51.048
It's all very amicable.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.223
Everything is with Roman.

21:52.267 --> 21:54.182
Um...

21:54.225 --> 21:56.880
but I have my own place
in the city now.

21:56.924 --> 21:58.969
We stay together
for the sake of our business

21:59.013 --> 22:01.842
and, um, our daughter Bea.

22:01.885 --> 22:03.757
ROMAN:
Hey there. Welcome.

22:03.800 --> 22:04.888
Hey.

22:04.932 --> 22:07.195
Oh, uh, Mr., uh, Cecchino.

22:07.238 --> 22:09.284
Your wife was just
showing us your farm.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.808
I almost didn't recognize you.ROMAN: Yeah.

22:11.852 --> 22:13.332
:
This is the real me.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.811
If Nora hadn't kicked my butt,

22:14.855 --> 22:16.596
telling me we can
be more than just

22:16.639 --> 22:18.380
family farmers, but...

22:18.424 --> 22:21.165
I'm just an old-fashioned
country boy at heart.

22:22.515 --> 22:24.299
Would y'all like some ice cream?

22:24.343 --> 22:25.779
We make it here
ourselves.

22:25.822 --> 22:28.347
We...
Um, yes, we would.

22:35.528 --> 22:38.182
NORA:
The collection belonged
to Roman's father.

22:38.226 --> 22:42.056
As kids, we'd sneak them
and play make-believe,

22:42.099 --> 22:43.362
everything from cowboys

22:43.405 --> 22:44.624
to Camelot.

22:44.667 --> 22:46.016
I hope to donate them to...

22:46.060 --> 22:48.715
But because of our
financial situation,

22:48.758 --> 22:50.934
we reached out to
several auction houses

22:50.978 --> 22:52.371
to appraise the lot.

22:52.414 --> 22:53.850
ROMAN:
I still think Trevor

22:53.894 --> 22:57.071
would have come through,
helped us out.

22:57.114 --> 22:59.943
NORA:
Roman believes
in everyone.

22:59.987 --> 23:01.989
He's far more trusting than me.

23:02.032 --> 23:03.773
Your daddy's the best.Yay, Daddy!

23:03.817 --> 23:05.253
LIZZIE:
We may need to take

23:05.296 --> 23:07.168
some of these,
dust them for prints.

23:07.211 --> 23:09.126
We should check with
our lawyer on that.

23:09.170 --> 23:11.041
They're quite valuable.

23:11.085 --> 23:13.435
Oh, and I just cleaned them
for the appraisal,

23:13.479 --> 23:15.437
so you'd only
find my prints.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.004
LIZZIE:
Uh-huh.

23:18.527 --> 23:21.269
Nora, is it true
you're an expert archer?

23:22.879 --> 23:24.098
Used to be.

23:24.141 --> 23:26.056
All kids around here
grow up bow-hunting,

23:26.100 --> 23:27.318
but I haven't shot in ages.

23:27.362 --> 23:28.711
DYLAN:
Was the carved

23:28.755 --> 23:32.933
Apache arrow, circa 1870,
sold or...

23:32.976 --> 23:34.064
removed?

23:34.108 --> 23:35.849
What are you...?

23:35.892 --> 23:37.764
No. It's gone?

23:38.982 --> 23:40.244
NORA:
Oh, my God.

23:40.288 --> 23:41.507
Was Trevor shot with an arrow?

23:44.510 --> 23:48.078
So, we have one
murdered financier,

23:48.122 --> 23:50.472
one missing murder weapon
and four suspects.

23:50.516 --> 23:52.039
Why so ritualized?

23:52.082 --> 23:53.475
The killer seemed to have

23:53.519 --> 23:55.956
a disturbed need
to punish Trevor,

23:55.999 --> 23:58.262
but also perhaps
to protect themselves.

23:59.525 --> 24:01.048
Excuse me.
I'll catch up.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.050
Uh-huh.

24:03.093 --> 24:05.182
About your grieving widow.What about her?

24:05.226 --> 24:07.402
She made multiple calls
to a burner phone in Bogotá

24:07.446 --> 24:08.795
before her trip.

24:08.838 --> 24:10.361
And here's a tidbit
from her prenup:

24:10.405 --> 24:12.233
There was a stipulation
that if no heir

24:12.276 --> 24:14.627
was produced in the first
five years of marriage,

24:14.670 --> 24:17.847
her access to his fortune
would be severely limited.

24:17.891 --> 24:19.980
LIZZIE: So Selena stood
to gain millions

24:20.023 --> 24:21.372
on her husband's death.

24:21.416 --> 24:23.113
And their fifth
wedding anniversary

24:23.157 --> 24:24.419
was coming up.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.421
So, if she wanted
access to his wealth,

24:26.465 --> 24:27.640
divorce was not an option.

24:27.683 --> 24:28.989
She needed Trevor dead.

24:29.032 --> 24:31.165
Where did you find out all this?

24:31.208 --> 24:32.296
Who just called?

24:32.340 --> 24:33.515
Does it matter?

24:33.559 --> 24:35.386
It matters if I want
to get a warrant

24:35.430 --> 24:37.258
to back these rumors up.
Yeah.

24:37.301 --> 24:39.086
Well, you're getting a warrant
for the Cecchinos' farm.

24:39.129 --> 24:40.566
Just get two.Come on.

24:40.609 --> 24:42.437
You know it's not that simple.
It takes time.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.265
I need to file
with probable cause,

24:44.308 --> 24:46.789
or a judge won't even...Oh, you lost me at:
"It takes time."

24:46.833 --> 24:48.138
Don't you want
to catch this killer?

24:48.182 --> 24:50.097
Always, but it has to be
by the book.

24:50.140 --> 24:51.272
Well, I guess
I'm just a sort of

24:51.315 --> 24:53.274
"by any means possible"
kind of guy.

24:53.317 --> 24:55.145
Which is just one more reason
that you're not a cop.

24:55.189 --> 24:57.017
Moving on-- the chef.

24:57.060 --> 24:59.106
I don't think...I know you don't think

24:59.149 --> 25:01.412
Haley's our killer, but she has
a history of violence,

25:01.456 --> 25:03.066
a weak alibi,
she hated Trevor, she...

25:03.110 --> 25:04.720
Hey, what I
was gonna say

25:04.764 --> 25:07.244
before you cut me off
is that I don't think

25:07.288 --> 25:10.030
you're wrong to keep
the chef as a suspect.

25:10.073 --> 25:12.685
She's the only one
who's shown a capacity for rage.

25:12.728 --> 25:14.077
Oh. Sorry.

25:14.121 --> 25:15.383
Thank you.You're welcome.

25:15.426 --> 25:16.689
Listen to this.

25:16.732 --> 25:19.256
A call came in
a half a minute ago

25:19.300 --> 25:21.432
for a disturbance--
a loud altercation

25:21.476 --> 25:23.522
at Cecchino's Restaurant.

25:23.565 --> 25:25.524
Wouldn't they
be closed by now?

25:31.486 --> 25:33.183
Anybody here?

25:33.227 --> 25:34.663
Police.

25:37.623 --> 25:39.886
Oh, no.

25:41.627 --> 25:45.326
Well, we can remove the chef
as a suspect.

25:51.375 --> 25:54.204
Another bizarre display.

26:01.429 --> 26:03.213
How many enemies
does this killer have?

26:13.702 --> 26:17.053
DYLAN: I mean,
first Trevor dead, now Haley.

26:17.097 --> 26:20.753
Two bodies on display,
bizarre punishment rituals.

26:20.796 --> 26:22.842
This killer may have
enemies and motives

26:22.885 --> 26:24.408
we may never understand.

26:24.452 --> 26:26.236
What I don't understand
is why Roman Cecchino

26:26.280 --> 26:28.238
hasn't responded to
any of our messages

26:28.282 --> 26:30.371
about his chef
being dead.
Yeah.

26:30.414 --> 26:32.765
Do you think he has
a deeply disturbed mind?

26:32.808 --> 26:34.027
Could have.

26:34.070 --> 26:35.681
Urban entrepreneur
who's really

26:35.724 --> 26:37.900
a country boy
at heart.

26:39.815 --> 26:42.252
Let's try the barn.

26:42.296 --> 26:44.864
Most of us see our sense
of self as a gray area,

26:44.907 --> 26:47.301
and we view others as such,
but some psyches

26:47.344 --> 26:49.825
can get trapped
in black or white worlds.

26:49.869 --> 26:51.261
That "splitting"
theory again?

26:51.305 --> 26:52.915
Yeah, the extreme
defense mechanism,

26:52.959 --> 26:55.526
where one's enemies
are 100% bad.

26:55.570 --> 26:57.311
LIZZIE: So Roman
might have seen

26:57.354 --> 26:58.704
Haley's ambition
and Trevor's greed

26:58.747 --> 27:00.662
sucking him deeper into
a life that he hated?

27:00.706 --> 27:03.099
The only problem
is Roman is a quiet guy.

27:03.143 --> 27:04.666
He could be hiding
duplicitous traits,

27:04.710 --> 27:06.799
but these people
tend to be borderline.

27:06.842 --> 27:08.757
They have tempers
and are overly dramatic.

27:11.238 --> 27:12.108
Gwen

27:12.152 --> 27:13.370
LIZZIE:
She's bleeding.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.200
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.

27:17.244 --> 27:18.637
Detective Needham,
Dr. Reinhart, what's up?

27:18.680 --> 27:20.116
Did you get our messages?
What's going on?

27:20.160 --> 27:21.944
Uh, we just
saved two lives.

27:21.988 --> 27:23.206
DYLAN:
What?

27:23.250 --> 27:24.555
We, uh, been up all night,

27:24.599 --> 27:26.166
uh, birthing a calf.

27:26.209 --> 27:28.037
GWEN:
Breach.

27:28.081 --> 27:29.952
Roman saved 'em both.

27:29.996 --> 27:31.780
I couldn't have done it
without you.

27:31.824 --> 27:34.174
LIZZIE: Sorry to bring
bad news, but, uh,

27:34.217 --> 27:36.176
there's been another murder.

27:36.219 --> 27:37.917
Your chef, Haley,
was found dead

27:37.960 --> 27:39.222
earlier at the
restaurant.

27:39.266 --> 27:40.963
What?We're gonna need

27:41.007 --> 27:42.356
to take a look around.

27:42.399 --> 27:44.358
But you can't
think that...

27:44.401 --> 27:45.707
Roman would never...

27:45.751 --> 27:47.317
No, it's okay.LIZZIE: Okay.

27:47.361 --> 27:48.536
Detectives are just
doing their job.

27:48.579 --> 27:49.711
LIZZIE:
Thank you.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.365
ROMAN:
Does my wife know?

27:51.408 --> 27:52.932
She's at the restaurant now.

27:52.975 --> 27:55.195
This is unreal. I...

27:56.892 --> 27:58.720
Where do you want to start?

27:58.764 --> 28:01.331
LIZZIE: Thank you so much
for coming in, Mrs. Trevor.

28:01.375 --> 28:04.595
Honestly, it's good to
get out of the house.

28:04.639 --> 28:07.337
And now another victim.

28:07.381 --> 28:09.296
Nora called me.

28:09.339 --> 28:11.690
She said you
searched their farm.

28:11.733 --> 28:13.169
But they
are true friends

28:13.213 --> 28:15.171
who just need more time
to repay their debt.

28:15.215 --> 28:19.567
I don't think you will find
anything against Roman or Nora.

28:19.610 --> 28:21.090
Uh, and we haven't.

28:21.134 --> 28:24.137
So, what is going on?

28:24.180 --> 28:25.878
Well...

28:25.921 --> 28:28.315
we were hoping you might
be able to help us with that.

28:28.358 --> 28:31.318
Of course. How can I help?

28:31.361 --> 28:33.059
Were you or your husband
involved in any

28:33.102 --> 28:34.930
business dealings
in Colombia?

28:34.974 --> 28:37.498
Sebastian had business
everywhere.

28:37.541 --> 28:40.501
Anything that might require
the use of burner phones?

28:41.763 --> 28:44.157
I know this
is hard.

28:46.420 --> 28:51.468
My husband and I were adopting
a baby in Colombia.

28:52.295 --> 28:54.950
Uh... a baby?

28:54.994 --> 28:57.431
The birth mother
is almost full term.

28:57.474 --> 29:01.087
She's very young
and from a prominent family,

29:01.130 --> 29:06.701
and we were using burner phones
to protect her identity.

29:07.833 --> 29:10.836
Oh. So, well, um...

29:10.879 --> 29:13.795
we don't have any
further questions,

29:13.839 --> 29:14.970
Detective Needham, do we?

29:15.014 --> 29:16.798
Uh, I...

29:16.842 --> 29:19.235
SELENA:
I loved my husband.

29:19.279 --> 29:22.412
He might have made enemies
in business.

29:22.456 --> 29:26.199
He might have not even
been nice in business.

29:26.242 --> 29:28.027
But to me,

29:28.070 --> 29:30.507
he was my white knight.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.902
He changed everything.

29:33.946 --> 29:35.338
Your what?

29:35.382 --> 29:36.818
My white knight.

29:40.256 --> 29:42.476
He saved me.

29:43.346 --> 29:45.871
Thank you, Selena,

29:45.914 --> 29:48.917
very, very much.

29:53.487 --> 29:54.880
White knight?
This is a real thing?

29:54.923 --> 29:57.752
Yes, a syndrome--
a... a subset of splitting.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.407
As soon as Selena said it,
it just came to me.

30:00.450 --> 30:01.930
We should be looking for someone

30:01.974 --> 30:03.932
who thinks of themself
as a savior.

30:03.976 --> 30:05.499
Those suffering
from this syndrome

30:05.542 --> 30:07.022
don't think they
have mortal enemies,

30:07.066 --> 30:08.763
but instead think that
someone they love

30:08.807 --> 30:12.158
is in danger and needs
their protection at all costs.

30:12.201 --> 30:14.856
The only person we have met
who may fit this profile

30:14.900 --> 30:17.250
is the Cecchinos'
farmhand, Gwen.

30:17.293 --> 30:18.947
She certainly seemed
to dote on Roman,

30:18.991 --> 30:21.515
and we've been able to document
her violent father,

30:21.558 --> 30:23.473
but otherwise I...

30:23.517 --> 30:25.954
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
A Gwen Anderson was rejected

30:25.998 --> 30:28.304
for military service,
deemed unfit.

30:28.348 --> 30:29.523
Another red flag.
Let's go.

30:29.566 --> 30:30.916
Okay, okay, but
not to Gwen.

30:30.959 --> 30:32.308
Not yet.
Why not?

30:32.352 --> 30:33.657
We don't have
hard evidence

30:33.701 --> 30:36.051
or probable cause,
but also, this theory...

30:36.095 --> 30:37.705
Needs to be fleshed out.

30:37.748 --> 30:40.751
And fleshed out by
someone who knows her.

30:40.795 --> 30:43.493
How well do you know
Gwen Anderson?

30:43.537 --> 30:45.365
ROMAN:
Uh... I grew up with Gwen.

30:45.408 --> 30:48.411
Her father ran our dairy
when we were kids.

30:48.455 --> 30:51.414
And did she take part in your
childhood games of make

30:51.458 --> 30:53.547
Good guys
against the bad?

30:54.591 --> 30:55.810
ROMAN:
Yeah.

30:55.854 --> 30:59.074
Um, she was family.

30:59.118 --> 31:04.297
Gwen's had a lot to overcome:
no mom, a violent dad.

31:04.340 --> 31:05.907
Nora didn't agree,

31:05.951 --> 31:07.778
but, um, I always

31:07.822 --> 31:09.824
felt the need to keep Gwen on.

31:09.868 --> 31:12.348
And she was grateful, I'm sure.

31:12.392 --> 31:14.307
Maybe too grateful.

31:14.350 --> 31:15.525
What do you mean?

31:15.569 --> 31:16.787
Would you say Gwen had

31:16.831 --> 31:18.572
a rigid sense
of right and wrong?

31:19.616 --> 31:21.967
She can be judgmental.

31:22.010 --> 31:23.446
Doesn't really keep friends.

31:23.490 --> 31:25.884
They always do
something to anger her.

31:25.927 --> 31:27.973
Drives them away.

31:28.016 --> 31:31.150
She didn't like Trevor
when he'd visit the farm.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.414
And she resented Haley.

31:34.457 --> 31:36.633
Accused her of flirting with me.

31:36.677 --> 31:37.852
But why would
she murder them?

31:37.896 --> 31:39.201
To protect you.

31:39.245 --> 31:40.420
She saw them as your enemies.

31:40.463 --> 31:41.900
Trevor was taking your farm.

31:41.943 --> 31:43.118
Haley's ambition

31:43.162 --> 31:44.554
was pulling you
into the city,

31:44.598 --> 31:46.905
away from your country life,
away from her.

31:46.948 --> 31:49.211
Gwen possibly suffered
severe trauma

31:49.255 --> 31:50.691
at a young age, and these...

31:50.734 --> 31:53.476
games of make-believe--
the cowboys and Camelot--

31:53.520 --> 31:54.913
she clung to bits of myth

31:54.956 --> 31:58.351
and formed her own
fantasy moral code.

31:59.439 --> 32:02.094
She did like to play
the executioner,

32:02.137 --> 32:03.530
avenger of wrongs.

32:03.573 --> 32:05.662
You were good to her,

32:05.706 --> 32:08.970
and so she fastened
her love onto you.

32:09.014 --> 32:12.495
She felt you needed protecting

32:12.539 --> 32:14.845
because she
needed protecting.

32:14.889 --> 32:17.718
My God.

32:17.761 --> 32:20.590
Was Gwen with you all night
during the calving?

32:21.852 --> 32:23.419
She joined me at dawn.

32:23.463 --> 32:25.421
What about when Trevor
was killed?

32:25.465 --> 32:28.033
ROMAN: She drives produce in
to the restaurant Mondays.

32:28.076 --> 32:30.731
And like Nora said,
we all grew up bow-hunting.

32:30.774 --> 32:33.560
Would Gwen see your wife
and daughter as enemies?

32:33.603 --> 32:34.778
ROMAN:
Um...

32:34.822 --> 32:35.954
well, never Bea.

32:35.997 --> 32:37.868
Bea's her little angel, but...

32:37.912 --> 32:39.609
Gwen's been worried
since the separation

32:39.653 --> 32:41.655
that Nora will take
Bea away from me.

32:41.698 --> 32:43.265
I... Oh, my God.

32:43.309 --> 32:44.832
Um...

32:44.875 --> 32:46.529
Bea's at school,

32:46.573 --> 32:48.618
and Nora's stopping by the farm.
They'll be alone.

32:48.662 --> 32:50.620
Come on, baby.
Come on, come on.

32:50.664 --> 32:52.057
Nora's not picking up.Okay.

32:52.100 --> 32:53.232
Keep trying. I'll drive.

32:53.275 --> 32:54.624
Please hurry.

33:04.243 --> 33:06.854
I should go in.
I know how to approach her.

33:06.897 --> 33:08.290
Protocol dictates that...

33:08.334 --> 33:09.988
I am not constrained
by protocol.

33:10.031 --> 33:11.511
And she's seen your warrant.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.861
She's already under pressure,
her violence erupting.

33:13.904 --> 33:15.341
I'm a police officer.

33:15.384 --> 33:16.646
You would be a trespasser.

33:16.690 --> 33:18.735
It's dangerous,
and you'll need backup.

33:18.779 --> 33:20.520
So you'll be here to meet
backup when they arrive

33:20.563 --> 33:21.564
or meet Nora
if she arrives.

33:21.608 --> 33:23.305
Nora may already
be here.

33:23.349 --> 33:25.699
Which is what I'm going
to scope out very carefully.

33:25.742 --> 33:28.006
If you get into trouble,
I won't know how to find you.

33:28.049 --> 33:29.659
I can take care of myself.

33:59.733 --> 34:01.517
LIZZIE :
Hi. You've reached Lizzie.

34:01.561 --> 34:02.823
Leave a message.Damn it, Lizzie.

34:02.866 --> 34:04.955
Put your phone on.

34:04.999 --> 34:07.697
Hey. Nora is already here.

34:07.741 --> 34:09.090
I'm coming to you.

34:09.134 --> 34:12.137
We may not have much time
to save her life.

34:21.842 --> 34:23.539
BEA:
Can I help?

34:23.583 --> 34:24.845
GWEN:
Yes, angel.

34:24.888 --> 34:26.890
Isn't this more
fun than school?

34:26.934 --> 34:28.283
Of course.

34:28.327 --> 34:29.719
You keep kneading.

34:29.763 --> 34:31.112
I'm gonna check
on something.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.461
Okay.

34:32.505 --> 34:34.420
When's my mom gonna be here?

34:34.463 --> 34:35.725
You don't need Mom.

34:35.769 --> 34:37.553
You got me.

35:00.794 --> 35:02.796
♪

35:24.034 --> 35:26.863
♪

35:31.781 --> 35:33.740
Nora.

35:43.532 --> 35:45.360
Can I help you?

35:45.404 --> 35:47.101
I'm looking for Roman.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.277
Roman isn't here.

36:10.820 --> 36:12.648
He has an enemy.

36:12.692 --> 36:14.302
He had more.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.870
You mean Trevor and Haley.

36:16.913 --> 36:19.873
They didn't deserve to breathe
the same air as Roman.

36:22.136 --> 36:24.312
Nora, I'm coming down.

36:26.793 --> 36:28.838
But did they deserve to die?

36:30.231 --> 36:31.624
Was there no chance
of penitence?

36:32.451 --> 36:33.930
It was too late.

36:41.416 --> 36:42.678
You had to protect him.

36:42.722 --> 36:44.027
You're here to arrest Roman.

36:44.071 --> 36:45.290
You're his enemy, too.

36:45.333 --> 36:46.639
But surely you'll let me
confess.

36:46.682 --> 36:49.946
Go on.
I confess I know
about your father.

36:49.990 --> 36:52.035
I know what
he did to you.

36:55.213 --> 36:57.780
I know that Roman
was kind to you.

36:57.824 --> 36:59.173
The only one.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.175
He's a pure soul.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.221
But he's safe now.

37:03.264 --> 37:04.874
You can stop.

37:05.919 --> 37:07.834
I got you. It's okay.

37:07.877 --> 37:09.227
It's okay.

37:13.535 --> 37:14.884
No.

37:14.928 --> 37:16.669
There's still the one
who betrayed him,

37:16.712 --> 37:18.236
who wants to take my angel away.

37:18.279 --> 37:20.586
Nora is not your enemy.

37:23.328 --> 37:24.459
Not for long.

37:27.245 --> 37:28.202
DYLAN:
Lizzie!

37:28.246 --> 37:29.769
Hey.

37:33.599 --> 37:35.514
We're gonna go.

37:41.737 --> 37:43.304
Now! Come on!

37:43.348 --> 37:44.305
Come on.

38:00.408 --> 38:02.976
No, no, no...You're okay. You're okay.

38:03.019 --> 38:04.673
BeaShe's fine. She's fine.

38:04.717 --> 38:05.805
Lizzie, cuffs.

38:05.848 --> 38:09.156
Just breathe. Just breathe.

38:11.201 --> 38:13.291
No, no.I'm sorry, Gwen.

38:13.334 --> 38:15.641
I'm truly sorry your life
went this way.

38:16.990 --> 38:18.774
LIZZIE:
With the consultant's assist,

38:18.818 --> 38:21.168
suspect was apprehended,
and backup arrived.

38:21.211 --> 38:24.867
Suspect was transported
to local precinct for booking.

38:26.608 --> 38:28.088
All physical evidence--

38:28.131 --> 38:30.351
including shears,
arrow and sickle--

38:30.395 --> 38:33.398
have been recovered
and catalogued.

38:36.749 --> 38:39.012
Per protocol,
acknowledgement sent

38:39.055 --> 38:40.840
to Dr. Dylan Reinhart.

38:42.232 --> 38:44.496
DYLAN: Okay, yeah,
so we're talking about

38:44.539 --> 38:46.193
splitting
and the three categories

38:46.236 --> 38:48.804
of borderline
personality disorder.

38:48.848 --> 38:51.067
Emotional/impulsive,
characterized

38:51.111 --> 38:53.983
by histrionic acts and...

38:55.071 --> 38:57.030
Uh...

38:57.073 --> 38:58.292
So sorry.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.512
I just totally lost
my train of thought.

39:00.555 --> 39:02.862
Um, maybe I should
have taken notes.

39:04.037 --> 39:05.647
Uh, Cory, can you help me out?

39:05.691 --> 39:07.127
Nope.

39:08.607 --> 39:10.870
LIZZIE:
Could it be narcissism...

39:10.913 --> 39:12.872
Professor?

39:12.915 --> 39:14.700
Or maybe someone
who doesn't

39:14.743 --> 39:16.615
work well with others?

39:16.658 --> 39:18.399
What's the term for that?

39:18.443 --> 39:20.140
Well, that's
not a symptom.

39:20.183 --> 39:21.663
That's a habit.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.319
And it can change.

39:25.363 --> 39:27.930
LIZZIE:
I know it's not logical,

39:27.974 --> 39:30.411
but I feel it anyway--
like it's my fault.

39:30.455 --> 39:32.979
If I wasn't able to keep
my old partner safe...

39:33.022 --> 39:34.372
Then you don't
deserve a new one.

39:34.415 --> 39:36.504
Even though I know
I could use one.

39:36.548 --> 39:39.115
Maybe you have a touch of
white knight syndrome yourself.

39:39.159 --> 39:42.902
: Ooh.
It's not such
a bad thing for a cop.

39:42.945 --> 39:44.991
It is so lovely here.

39:45.034 --> 39:46.993
Yeah. And safe.

39:48.777 --> 39:52.346
I can see why someone would
rather teach than do.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.782
Better hours, too.

39:53.826 --> 39:55.436
And all that
procedural stuff--

39:55.480 --> 39:56.916
it's not really
your thing.

39:56.959 --> 39:58.961
Boring!

39:59.005 --> 40:01.616
And obstructionist.

40:01.660 --> 40:03.618
And teamwork is really
awkward for me.

40:03.662 --> 40:05.011
I like to be
in charge.

40:05.054 --> 40:05.968
I noticed.

40:06.012 --> 40:07.927
And you always
follow the rules.

40:07.970 --> 40:10.146
While you always
break them.

40:10.190 --> 40:12.453
So I think we agree.

40:12.497 --> 40:15.021
Yeah, I think we do.Mm-hmm.

40:16.892 --> 40:19.025
We should be partners.Absolutely.
