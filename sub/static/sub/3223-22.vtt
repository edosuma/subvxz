WEBVTT

00:04.420 --> 00:06.756
Takes a painful, long time
to bleed out from the gut.

00:06.923 --> 00:08.591
Do whatever you want, Crowley.

00:08.758 --> 00:11.594
Metatron. He's an angel.
He's the scribe of God.

00:11.761 --> 00:13.638
This is Metatron? This is Metatron?

00:13.804 --> 00:17.433
I'm not one of them. I'm not an archangel.
I worked in the secretarial pool...

00:17.642 --> 00:19.769
...before God chose me
to take down the word.

00:24.982 --> 00:26.609
I've got it. The third trial.

00:26.776 --> 00:28.611
- What is it?
- To cure a demon.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.909
- Cass?
- A little help here.

00:36.202 --> 00:39.664
Abaddon. She's a demon. SAM:
Who, it turns out, is a Knight of Hell.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.792
Knights of Hell are handpicked
by Lucifer himself.

00:44.126 --> 00:46.963
That demon trap in your noggin
is gonna keep you from smoking out.

00:47.129 --> 00:50.216
We're gonna cut you into steaks,
and bury each strip under cement.

01:06.816 --> 01:10.653
I can't believe
you finally came up here with me.

01:11.028 --> 01:12.905
Why wouldn't I?

01:13.155 --> 01:14.657
I love this place.

01:14.865 --> 01:18.494
It's like I can breathe, you know?

01:20.621 --> 01:22.123
Tommy.

01:23.165 --> 01:24.166
You okay?

01:30.256 --> 01:32.842
Yeah. Yeah, I'm good. Heh.

01:37.722 --> 01:40.182
- Did you hear that?
- What?

01:41.309 --> 01:42.351
The growl.

01:42.518 --> 01:44.979
No. Maybe it's a bear.

01:47.690 --> 01:50.860
- Shelly, get back.
- Baby, what is wrong?

01:51.027 --> 01:53.112
It's not a bear. It's a Wendigo.

01:59.994 --> 02:02.121
Hide in the bedroom. Right now.
Hide, Shelly.

02:02.288 --> 02:04.373
Tommy, I don't hear anything.

02:05.124 --> 02:06.959
What are you doing?

02:07.168 --> 02:10.170
I'm gonna light his ugly ass on fire.
Get back.

02:25.436 --> 02:28.189
What's happening?

02:28.397 --> 02:30.191
Tommy!

02:47.583 --> 02:49.460
- Please tell me that's everything.
- Yeah.

02:49.627 --> 02:52.213
Heh, no, not even close.

02:52.421 --> 02:56.509
See, the Men of Letters kept files on every
demonic possession for the last 300 years.

02:56.676 --> 03:02.139
We got, uh, Borden, Lizzie,
all the way to Crane, Ichabod.

03:07.436 --> 03:10.064
- How you feeling?
- Honestly? Um...

03:10.940 --> 03:13.442
My, uh... My whole body hurts.

03:13.818 --> 03:17.947
I feel nauseous and like I'm starving
at the same time.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.325
And everything smells like rotting meat.

03:21.492 --> 03:23.577
I've had that hangover.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.329
JÃ¤ger, man. Pfft.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.124
Maybe you should, uh,
take a break, get some air.

03:28.290 --> 03:31.127
Only thing that's gonna make me feel better
is finishing this.

03:31.335 --> 03:32.628
All right.

03:32.795 --> 03:35.464
Well, I'll go get you some grub.
Keep your strength up.

03:36.465 --> 03:38.175
Morning.

03:42.471 --> 03:44.390
I like this bunker.

03:44.974 --> 03:46.267
It's orderly.

03:47.059 --> 03:50.229
Well, give us a few months.
Dean wants to get a Ping-Pong table.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.273
Heard of that. It's a game, right?

03:56.318 --> 03:57.778
You okay?

03:57.987 --> 04:00.948
My wound isn't healing
as quickly as I'd hoped.

04:01.115 --> 04:02.867
But I am getting better.

04:04.827 --> 04:07.288
And you're getting worse.

04:07.913 --> 04:11.083
Well, two trials down, one to go.

04:12.209 --> 04:14.378
And the final test, you know what it is?

04:14.587 --> 04:16.338
I have to cure a demon.

04:16.547 --> 04:18.298
Of what?

04:19.257 --> 04:21.385
That's what we're trying to figure out.

04:21.552 --> 04:22.595
Soup's on.

04:28.517 --> 04:31.604
Here we go. I think this is, uh...

04:32.646 --> 04:34.523
Ah, it's still good.

04:35.149 --> 04:37.151
A half-drunk beer, um...

04:37.318 --> 04:39.528
...jerky and three peanut-butter cups?

04:39.737 --> 04:41.363
Yeah, we're running a little low.

04:43.282 --> 04:44.784
I'll make a run.

04:45.034 --> 04:47.036
Dean, I can go with you.

04:49.538 --> 04:50.956
Dean.

04:51.874 --> 04:52.917
I'm sorry.

04:55.544 --> 04:56.587
For what?

04:59.173 --> 05:00.549
For everything.

05:00.758 --> 05:02.259
Everything?

05:02.718 --> 05:05.805
Like, uh...? Like ignoring us?

05:07.723 --> 05:08.766
Yes.

05:08.933 --> 05:12.436
Or like bolting off with the angel tablet
then losing it.

05:13.312 --> 05:16.065
Because you didn't trust me?
You didn't trust me?

05:17.775 --> 05:20.277
- Yes.
- Yeah.

05:21.487 --> 05:24.156
No, that's not gonna cut it. Not this time.

05:25.574 --> 05:28.494
So you can take your little apology
and you cram it up your ass.

05:29.578 --> 05:33.332
Dean,
I thought I was doing the right thing.

05:33.499 --> 05:35.835
Yeah, you always do.

05:39.588 --> 05:42.299
Hey, uh, do we have a room 7B?

05:47.888 --> 05:51.934
Dude, go easy on Cass, okay?
He's one of the good guys.

05:53.435 --> 05:56.480
Look, if anybody else, I mean anybody,
pulled that kind of crap...

05:56.647 --> 06:00.901
...I'd stab them in their neck on principle.
Why should I give him a free pass?

06:01.819 --> 06:04.238
Because it's Cass.

06:06.031 --> 06:07.950
What are we supposed to be
looking for down here?

06:08.117 --> 06:10.119
Um, anything on case 1138.

06:10.286 --> 06:16.125
It was a Class 5 infernal event.
St. Louis, March 8th, 1957.

06:16.750 --> 06:18.502
Class 5 infernal event?

06:18.669 --> 06:21.338
Yeah. See, the Letters had this whole
rating system.

06:21.505 --> 06:23.507
The Exorcist would have been a Class 2.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.594
All right, so, what makes
this puppet show so special?

06:26.760 --> 06:29.179
- It was weird.
- Weird how?

06:29.346 --> 06:33.517
No clue. One of the files just had a note
written in the margin about room 7B...

06:33.684 --> 06:37.146
...and the word "weird"
with three exclamation points.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.899
- Good times.
- Yeah.

06:45.988 --> 06:47.489
Hmm.

06:48.240 --> 06:49.867
Got it.

06:58.876 --> 07:00.377
Sammy, check this out.

07:03.505 --> 07:04.798
Whoa.

07:07.343 --> 07:08.928
Is that a devil's trap?

07:09.386 --> 07:11.680
Takes up half the room.

07:20.856 --> 07:24.193
These chains,
there's spellwork etched into them.

07:27.821 --> 07:28.906
So we have a dungeon.

07:30.491 --> 07:31.742
Finally.

07:34.870 --> 07:36.747
- What do you got there?
- Oh.

07:44.505 --> 07:45.714
Movie night?

07:56.767 --> 08:00.020
Simon. We're filming.

08:00.980 --> 08:02.231
Uh...

08:02.564 --> 08:04.483
Hello, world.

08:04.650 --> 08:09.238
So this new ritual we're going to see, this
new type of exorcism, how does it work?

08:12.366 --> 08:14.868
Simon, come.

08:19.164 --> 08:22.960
I don't know, it's my first time.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.260
Is that Abaddon?

08:33.386 --> 08:37.515
She's not kill-y enough. It's gotta be
the, uh, the chick she possessed.

08:47.276 --> 08:49.778
Hurry. We must do it now.

08:56.660 --> 08:58.787
Dead. They're all dead.

08:59.872 --> 09:01.999
Everyone you ever loved.

09:02.166 --> 09:04.752
Those chains look exactly
like the ones in our dungeon.

09:04.918 --> 09:08.464
- In your what?
- Demon on a leash, cool.

09:51.465 --> 09:53.217
Where's the demon?

09:55.260 --> 09:57.513
Stop filming.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.515
What happened?

09:59.681 --> 10:00.974
Would you just stop?

10:08.690 --> 10:12.528
Well, that was weird,
with three exclamation points.

10:12.736 --> 10:17.407
That wasn't a normal exorcism.
They changed the words.

10:17.991 --> 10:21.620
I believe lustra is Latin
for "wash" or "cleanse."

10:21.787 --> 10:24.832
Yeah, because that was the most
freaky thing was the vocabulary.

10:24.998 --> 10:28.585
What about the, uh, bloody high-five
or the chest-burster?

10:28.752 --> 10:31.255
Anything else on the film?
Like director's commentary?

10:31.421 --> 10:32.714
A sequel, maybe?

10:32.881 --> 10:34.591
Yeah. Listen to this.

10:34.758 --> 10:37.678
The older priest, Max Thompson,
bit the dust in '58...

10:37.886 --> 10:42.141
...but the younger one is still alive
and still in St. Louis.

10:42.391 --> 10:45.936
- Think this kind of weird is worth the drive?
- Everything in those folders...

10:46.103 --> 10:49.731
...the possessions, the deals, all of it,
we've seen that before. But that...

10:51.900 --> 10:52.943
...that was all new.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.654
- Yeah, it's worth the drive.
- All right, let's roll.

10:56.113 --> 10:57.906
Not you.

10:58.699 --> 11:00.534
Sam is more damaged than I am.

11:00.701 --> 11:04.454
Yeah, well, you know, even banged up,
Sammy comes through.

11:04.621 --> 11:07.207
- Dean, I just wanna help.
- We don't need your help.

11:08.292 --> 11:10.127
Just stay here...

11:10.794 --> 11:11.920
...and get better.

11:14.923 --> 11:18.385
Father Thompson
had some unorthodox ideas...

11:18.552 --> 11:21.805
...which is why the Men of Letters
were interested.

11:21.972 --> 11:23.223
Unorthodox how?

11:23.432 --> 11:25.434
He believed demons could be saved.

11:26.977 --> 11:29.062
What exactly do you mean, "saved"?

11:30.355 --> 11:35.277
A demon is a human soul
twisted and corrupted by its time in hell.

11:35.444 --> 11:39.198
Father Thompson believed
that you could wash that taint away...

11:39.364 --> 11:41.366
...and restore their humanity.

11:41.533 --> 11:44.912
So, what, they just stay in whatever
schmuck they're possessing...

11:45.078 --> 11:46.622
...and get a ticket upstairs?

11:46.788 --> 11:48.874
I wish I knew.

11:50.000 --> 11:55.297
Okay, but this, this ritual,
can cure a demon?

11:55.464 --> 11:58.425
I suppose, if it worked.

11:58.592 --> 12:02.221
But that night,
something went terribly wrong.

12:02.596 --> 12:07.267
The demon escaped into the world,
and that poor old woman...

12:08.143 --> 12:09.645
It was horrible.

12:11.647 --> 12:13.941
I know Father Thompson kept trying.

12:14.107 --> 12:17.319
There were other possessions,
experiments...

12:17.486 --> 12:20.906
...but I couldn't face that, not again.

12:21.323 --> 12:25.494
And then, a few months later...

12:26.578 --> 12:27.955
...he was dead.

12:28.121 --> 12:33.252
- How'd that happen?
- Something tore him apart.

12:35.504 --> 12:38.632
Did he keep any, uh...?

12:40.300 --> 12:42.970
Did he keep records or...?

12:51.103 --> 12:54.231
Uh, ahem. You have a bathroom, maybe?

12:56.733 --> 12:58.235
Thanks.

13:03.865 --> 13:06.952
- Is he all right?
- Uh...

13:08.161 --> 13:13.375
No, Padre.
He's pretty damn far from all right.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.710
That's why we're here.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.378
I don't understand.

13:16.545 --> 13:20.424
Well, the short story is, Sammy there is
gonna take whatever shredded your friend...

13:20.590 --> 13:24.594
...and every other black-eyed bitch out there
and he's gonna get rid of them, for good.

13:25.762 --> 13:27.681
He is?

13:28.181 --> 13:30.058
- In his condition?
- Heh.

13:30.809 --> 13:33.312
Over the past couple of months
I've seen him do crap...

13:33.478 --> 13:35.272
...I didn't even think was possible.

13:35.439 --> 13:38.942
I mean, sure, he's miserable
and he's hurting, but you know what?

13:39.109 --> 13:43.572
Well, there's not a doubt in my mind that
he's gonna cross that finish line. Not one.

13:45.324 --> 13:46.783
So will you help us?

13:48.452 --> 13:52.331
- I'll get Father Thompson's things for you.
- Thank you.

14:30.452 --> 14:31.453
Dude.

14:35.499 --> 14:36.792
Ugh.

14:38.293 --> 14:39.628
Dude.

14:45.008 --> 14:47.886
- Dude.
- I have money.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.726
Where is the pie?

14:55.560 --> 14:56.645
I think we're out.

14:58.355 --> 15:01.441
You don't understand. I need pie.

15:02.943 --> 15:06.238
Put the virgin down, Castiel.

15:09.741 --> 15:11.326
We need to talk.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.833
- Wait, you're Metatron?
- Yeah.

15:17.999 --> 15:20.627
- The Metatron?
- Please.

15:23.672 --> 15:27.426
- In public, it's Marv.
- Marv.

15:27.592 --> 15:29.219
And you're Castiel.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.597
Kevin Tran told me about you.

15:32.764 --> 15:34.099
- He did?
- Yeah.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.643
According to him,
you and I have a lot in common.

15:36.810 --> 15:40.355
We're both free thinkers,
we're both on heaven's most-wanted list.

15:40.522 --> 15:43.024
I thought we could socialize.
Maybe grab a bite.

15:43.525 --> 15:44.901
I'm sorry, we can what?

15:45.569 --> 15:49.406
Look, I've been on sabbatical.
I'm trying to play catch-up...

15:49.573 --> 15:52.909
...but I have to talk to somebody
about what's going on back home.

15:53.452 --> 15:56.371
- And by home, you mean heaven?
- Right.

15:56.538 --> 16:00.834
I've been looking around, crawling through
a few divine nooks and crannies...

16:01.042 --> 16:02.627
...and from what I can see...

16:02.794 --> 16:05.464
...without the archangels,
it's a mess up there.

16:05.630 --> 16:06.840
Open warfare.

16:07.215 --> 16:10.469
I thought Naomi was running things now.

16:10.635 --> 16:12.554
Is that what she told you?

16:13.472 --> 16:17.559
I mean, Naomi's a player,
don't get me wrong, just one of many.

16:17.726 --> 16:22.981
There are factions upon factions,
all fighting, betraying each other.

16:23.148 --> 16:26.902
It's just a matter of time
before they start ripping each other apart.

16:27.068 --> 16:30.155
- It's all broken.
- I know, I'm the one that broke it.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.074
There was a time when I thought
I could lead our people...

16:33.241 --> 16:34.826
...but I was mistaken.

16:34.993 --> 16:36.912
I spilled so much blood.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.338
And I've tried to atone for my sins,
and I did penance...

16:46.505 --> 16:50.383
...and I betrayed my friends to protect
our secrets, but I've just failed.

16:50.592 --> 16:52.761
- And now...
- Look, I know.

16:53.762 --> 16:58.058
But now the angels, heaven...

16:58.225 --> 17:00.936
...need someone to come to the rescue.

17:01.102 --> 17:02.521
They need us.

17:02.687 --> 17:04.814
- Us?
- Yeah, just picture it.

17:05.523 --> 17:08.401
We ride to the rescue, save the day.

17:08.609 --> 17:10.237
Make a great story.

17:11.988 --> 17:16.535
Look, the angels are like
a big dysfunctional family.

17:16.701 --> 17:21.957
We need to lock them all in a room
until we work these problems out.

17:22.123 --> 17:25.502
- All the factions, you, me.
- What, like a big family meeting?

17:26.169 --> 17:27.378
Exactly.

17:28.128 --> 17:31.132
Which is why
we have to shut down heaven.

17:31.299 --> 17:32.926
What?

17:34.010 --> 17:35.387
Do you like crepes?

17:35.554 --> 17:37.973
- Wait...
- Eugenie's in Ojai...

17:38.139 --> 17:41.434
...makes the greatest
caramel apple crepes.

17:42.143 --> 17:43.895
Metatron. Marv.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.320
I can't find Cass.

17:52.487 --> 17:53.655
You think he blew town?

17:53.822 --> 17:55.407
Sounds like him.

17:55.574 --> 18:00.412
So it turns out that, uh, Father Thompson
recorded all of his demon-cure tests.

18:00.579 --> 18:05.000
This one here, this was the last one.
Two days before he died.

18:08.169 --> 18:11.172
The date is August 3rd, 1958.

18:11.339 --> 18:14.884
This is trial 19, hour one.

18:15.051 --> 18:18.388
My subject is Peter Kent.

18:19.514 --> 18:23.602
Mr. Kent is the father
of two young sons...

18:23.768 --> 18:29.065
...and three weeks ago,
he was possessed by a demon.

18:33.862 --> 18:35.739
I'm going to ask you a question now.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.994
When you crawled into Mr. Kent...

18:41.202 --> 18:43.455
...and ate his children...

18:43.622 --> 18:44.998
...how did it feel?

18:46.583 --> 18:48.501
Orgasmic.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.554
The first dose has been administered.

18:59.721 --> 19:03.516
Do we know what Padre
was, uh, dosing number-one dad up with?

19:03.975 --> 19:06.478
Uh, yeah. His own purified blood.

19:07.562 --> 19:08.605
Purified how?

19:08.772 --> 19:11.399
Before he started,
Father Thompson went to confession.

19:11.566 --> 19:15.070
This is trial 19, hour two.

19:15.987 --> 19:19.032
When you ate his children,
how did it feel?

19:19.240 --> 19:20.241
Stringy!

19:23.078 --> 19:25.538
A second dose has been administered.

19:25.747 --> 19:28.708
Hour four. When you ate his children...

19:28.875 --> 19:31.211
- Kiss my ass.
- ...how did it feel?

19:31.378 --> 19:32.754
Soft.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.676
The sixth dose has been administered.

19:37.842 --> 19:39.260
- Stop.
- How...

19:39.427 --> 19:40.929
Please.

19:42.555 --> 19:43.640
...did it...

19:45.517 --> 19:49.979
- ...feel?
- Stop!

20:02.951 --> 20:06.413
Hour eight. The subject is prepped.

20:36.317 --> 20:41.573
When you ate his children,
how did it feel?

20:42.449 --> 20:43.950
They were screaming...

20:44.325 --> 20:46.327
...and I laughed.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.538
Why did I laugh?

20:50.457 --> 20:52.417
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

20:52.584 --> 20:53.668
God. I was a monster.

20:53.835 --> 20:56.838
But now you are a man again.

20:57.255 --> 20:59.924
You have been saved.

21:03.344 --> 21:07.098
Did he just cure a demon?

21:07.265 --> 21:08.516
Maybe.

21:09.893 --> 21:13.062
- Can we take this hoodoo on a test drive?
- Um...

21:13.229 --> 21:16.357
I mean, I have the exorcism right here,
all we need is the blood...

21:16.524 --> 21:19.027
...consecrated ground and a demon.

21:19.194 --> 21:21.196
So, what, we summon a demon, trap it...?

21:21.780 --> 21:24.365
Or we use one that we've already tagged.

21:24.699 --> 21:27.702
Do we still have Dad's
old, uh, Army field-surgeon's kit?

21:27.869 --> 21:29.287
It's in the trunk. Why?

21:29.454 --> 21:32.916
Yeah, I think it's time we put
Humpty Dumpty back together again.

21:40.757 --> 21:42.550
Why did you leave?

21:42.717 --> 21:45.887
I can't have this conversation
on an empty stomach.

21:46.054 --> 21:48.181
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

21:48.389 --> 21:49.432
Can I get you anything?

21:49.641 --> 21:51.059
- Coffee, please.
- Sure.

21:51.434 --> 21:52.769
Cool coat.

21:52.977 --> 21:55.688
No, it's actually quite warm.

21:56.564 --> 21:59.400
Cute and funny. Okay.

22:04.197 --> 22:07.450
I should have picked
a better-looking vessel.

22:07.617 --> 22:09.244
What did you mean
we can shut down heaven?

22:09.410 --> 22:12.705
Oh, you know, the trials.

22:12.872 --> 22:15.166
God's little "pull in case of emergency."

22:15.416 --> 22:18.920
The Leviathans get out of control,
you put them in purgatory.

22:19.087 --> 22:23.716
Demons get a little too demonic,
toss them into hell.

22:23.883 --> 22:26.761
Angels get uppity, slam the Pearly Gates.

22:26.928 --> 22:30.765
You say you know the trials
to close heaven?

22:30.932 --> 22:32.976
I wrote them down.

22:34.102 --> 22:35.478
It's not something you forget.

22:37.605 --> 22:40.733
Look, I think a little alone time
would be good for the angels.

22:40.942 --> 22:42.944
At the very least...

22:43.570 --> 22:47.365
...it would stop the fighting up there
from spilling out down here.

22:47.532 --> 22:50.577
Which will happen. It always does.

22:51.077 --> 22:52.829
You're gonna complete these tests?

22:53.037 --> 22:54.622
No.

22:55.456 --> 22:57.208
I can't.

22:57.458 --> 22:59.586
I am a pencil pusher.

23:00.879 --> 23:02.171
Always have been.

23:02.380 --> 23:04.299
I'm not strong enough.

23:04.465 --> 23:07.677
But you, you are a warrior.

23:08.803 --> 23:12.974
I've got the plan, you got the muscle.

23:13.641 --> 23:15.059
We can do this.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.980
Heaven needs your help, Castiel.

23:19.647 --> 23:23.026
I am the one that caused these problems,
I should be the one to fix them.

23:23.192 --> 23:27.030
But you understand this is,
uh, not gonna be easy.

23:28.031 --> 23:29.282
I understand.

23:29.490 --> 23:30.617
No, you don't.

23:31.701 --> 23:33.870
See our waitress?

23:38.541 --> 23:39.918
She's the first trial.

23:41.044 --> 23:42.378
Gotta cut her heart out.

23:42.587 --> 23:43.922
What?

23:44.088 --> 23:45.173
No. She's...

23:46.424 --> 23:47.717
She's just a girl.

23:47.884 --> 23:51.054
No, she isn't. She's a Nephilim.

23:51.220 --> 23:53.014
An abomination.

23:53.181 --> 23:55.183
She's the offspring of an angel
and a human?

23:55.350 --> 23:57.727
- I thought that wasn't allowed.
- It's not.

23:57.894 --> 24:00.188
There's only one on Earth...

24:00.772 --> 24:02.523
...and you are looking at it.

24:02.690 --> 24:05.902
But she didn't choose to be a Nephilim,
so she's innocent.

24:06.110 --> 24:07.445
Yes, she is.

24:08.071 --> 24:10.156
I told you it wasn't gonna be easy.

24:10.615 --> 24:14.619
But if you wanna do this,
Castiel, if you really wanna do this...

24:14.786 --> 24:17.538
...you gotta ask yourself
what's more important...

24:17.705 --> 24:21.209
...her life or your family?

24:28.549 --> 24:30.593
So you really think this'll work?

24:30.760 --> 24:32.929
Dude, we got needles, we got thread.

24:33.096 --> 24:35.515
We've seen Young Frankenstein
about a thousand times.

24:35.682 --> 24:36.766
Yeah, we're golden.

24:41.854 --> 24:44.273
This is gonna be disgusting.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.234
Uh-huh.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.978
Morning, sunshines.

25:22.979 --> 25:24.689
It worked.

25:24.856 --> 25:25.898
You owe me a beer.

25:26.107 --> 25:29.986
And I owe you both so, so much.

25:30.611 --> 25:33.114
I can't wait to tear out
those pretty green eyes.

25:35.116 --> 25:36.993
Good luck with that.

25:37.702 --> 25:39.829
We figured kitty didn't need her claws.

25:43.833 --> 25:45.877
Then I'll stump you to death,
it'll be swell.

25:47.587 --> 25:49.130
Yeah, not gonna happen either.

25:49.297 --> 25:50.965
The bullet, remember?

25:54.635 --> 25:56.554
So you sit there like a good little bitch.

25:56.721 --> 26:00.433
We're gonna consecrate the ground,
and you're gonna get to fessing up.

26:00.641 --> 26:02.852
- Oh, I know this tune.
- I doubt that.

26:03.061 --> 26:07.523
Father Max Thompson.
Born October 12th, 1910.

26:07.732 --> 26:09.817
Died August 5th, 1958.

26:09.984 --> 26:12.528
Who do you think ripped him apart?

26:14.155 --> 26:17.909
Word got back to home office
that Maxie was messing with things...

26:18.451 --> 26:20.036
...so we made an example.

26:20.244 --> 26:23.581
It wasn't my most artful kill,
but it was effective.

26:24.207 --> 26:28.461
And, bonus, before he died,
he told me all about Josie Sands.

26:28.669 --> 26:31.214
I found her, and
I rode her into the Men Of Letters...

26:31.380 --> 26:33.549
...and what I did to them...

26:33.758 --> 26:34.884
...that was art.

26:35.093 --> 26:39.222
- So you know what Max was doing?
- Fella screamed the basics...

26:39.847 --> 26:41.057
...but it'll never work.

26:41.265 --> 26:42.558
You keep telling yourself that.

26:51.317 --> 26:53.111
Hello, boy.

26:53.319 --> 26:55.029
Crowley.

26:55.404 --> 26:56.739
Crowley?

26:58.199 --> 26:59.325
The salesman?

26:59.534 --> 27:00.701
Try the King of Hell.

27:01.410 --> 27:02.703
This is a joke, right?

27:05.498 --> 27:07.125
Stay.

27:14.757 --> 27:16.467
Hold on.

27:16.926 --> 27:18.636
- How'd you get this number?
- Ah.

27:18.803 --> 27:19.887
First thing's first.

27:20.096 --> 27:21.639
What are you wearing?

27:21.848 --> 27:25.434
- Okay, hanging up now. Hang up.
- Fine. This isn't a social call.

27:25.643 --> 27:29.313
I was wondering,
you lads been reading the papers?

27:29.480 --> 27:33.234
Say, Denver Times from yesterday?

27:33.401 --> 27:35.736
No? Well, you should.

27:35.903 --> 27:37.321
It's sidesplitting.

27:58.301 --> 28:01.721
What the hell,
I'm sexting you an address.

28:01.888 --> 28:05.224
Check it out then we'll talk. Ta-ra.

28:05.391 --> 28:07.768
Wait. What?

28:07.977 --> 28:09.395
Crowley.

28:39.383 --> 28:41.928
- Here it is. Vic's name is Tommy Collins.
- Tommy.

28:42.428 --> 28:44.305
- Why do I know that name?
- Tommy Collins.

28:44.472 --> 28:47.183
We saved him from a Wendigo,
like, forever ago.

28:47.350 --> 28:49.977
Okay, and what,
you think that Crowley blew his head off?

28:50.144 --> 28:52.897
What are we dealing with here,
some demon-Wendigo team-up?

28:53.606 --> 28:55.191
Yeah, no clue.

28:55.399 --> 28:58.152
All right, well,
I'll pour one out for Tommy later.

28:58.527 --> 29:00.154
As far as Crowley goes, screw him.

29:00.321 --> 29:03.824
We got everything we need
to put him in a permanent time-out.

29:07.662 --> 29:08.704
No.

29:08.913 --> 29:11.374
No, no, no.

29:11.999 --> 29:15.544
She's gone. She's... Son of a bitch.

29:31.435 --> 29:32.853
Dean.

29:33.062 --> 29:34.647
Dean.

29:37.733 --> 29:39.026
Text message from Crowley.

29:39.527 --> 29:43.197
- An address in Prosperity, Indiana.
- Prosperity, Indiana.

29:43.614 --> 29:44.907
Didn't we work a case there?

29:45.074 --> 29:47.785
Yeah, yeah. The one with the witches
and the baked goods.

29:48.369 --> 29:52.581
- So he's going after somebody there now?
- I don't know. We gotta check it out.

29:52.790 --> 29:54.875
- You know it's a trap.
- Of course it's a trap.

29:55.084 --> 29:58.421
But a trap means demons,
and we could use one right now.

30:37.418 --> 30:39.086
Sam.

30:43.090 --> 30:44.759
Is that Jenny?

30:54.560 --> 30:56.187
You were a great gal, Jenny Klein.

31:04.695 --> 31:06.322
Hey.

31:06.781 --> 31:08.949
What the hell are you doing, Crowley?

31:09.116 --> 31:11.952
Oh, Moosie, isn't it obvious?

31:12.119 --> 31:15.081
I'm killing everyone you've ever saved.

31:15.289 --> 31:18.793
The damsels in distress,
the innocent whippersnappers...

31:19.001 --> 31:20.669
...the would-be vampire chow.

31:20.878 --> 31:22.755
- All of them.
- How do you even know...?

31:22.963 --> 31:26.258
I have my sources
and a cracking research team.

31:27.134 --> 31:30.888
When you boys hit a town,
you tend to leave a mess.

31:31.097 --> 31:34.100
Now, you're probably wondering
why my droogs aren't in there...

31:34.266 --> 31:38.979
...giving you the bum's rush,
so let's brass these tacks, shall we?

31:39.188 --> 31:44.151
I'm gonna gut one person every 12 hours
until you bring me the demon tablet...

31:44.318 --> 31:48.656
...and stop this whole trials nonsense.

31:48.864 --> 31:50.908
We don't have the tablet,
Kevin took it and...

31:51.075 --> 31:53.077
I took Kevin.

31:53.411 --> 31:56.163
Then someone took him back.

31:56.372 --> 31:58.874
Word from the cloud is
that it wasn't heaven...

31:59.041 --> 32:02.503
...so either the cutest little prophet
in the world is with you two lugs...

32:02.670 --> 32:05.589
...or you'd better find him
tout bloody suite.

32:05.756 --> 32:08.509
Because time, she is a-wasting.

32:08.676 --> 32:13.013
About now,
you're thinking of ways to stop me.

32:13.180 --> 32:16.350
You won't be able to, but you'll try.

32:16.517 --> 32:19.186
Because that's what you do...

32:20.020 --> 32:21.772
...you try.

32:22.022 --> 32:25.067
So time for an object lesson.

32:25.276 --> 32:30.739
Indianapolis, The Ivy Motel, Room 116.

32:31.574 --> 32:34.160
You have 57 minutes.

32:43.335 --> 32:45.921
What's it gonna be, Castiel?

32:58.267 --> 32:59.310
Sarah.

32:59.768 --> 33:00.895
Sam?

33:02.229 --> 33:04.231
- I'm Sarah Blake.
- I'm Sam.

33:11.238 --> 33:12.948
What's going on?

33:30.883 --> 33:33.135
I know what you are.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.555
I could see your halos.

33:36.722 --> 33:39.767
And we know what you are, abomination.

33:41.101 --> 33:43.395
Please, I'm not...

33:43.812 --> 33:45.731
I try to be nice.

33:45.898 --> 33:47.358
I just wanna live my life.

33:48.275 --> 33:49.818
We know.

33:51.612 --> 33:52.780
I am sorry.

33:54.114 --> 33:55.157
You will be.

34:10.422 --> 34:11.757
Having fun?

34:26.605 --> 34:28.315
You want an abomination?

34:28.482 --> 34:30.985
I'll show you an abomination.

34:47.585 --> 34:51.005
So a demon named Crowley...

34:51.170 --> 34:54.091
...is gonna kill me...

34:54.717 --> 34:55.967
...in 16 minutes.

34:56.176 --> 34:57.511
No.

34:58.095 --> 34:59.763
No, he's not.

35:10.899 --> 35:12.985
Sarah. Long time.

35:13.694 --> 35:15.863
What you doing in Indy?

35:16.030 --> 35:20.534
I was scouting an estate sale for my dad.

35:20.784 --> 35:22.369
Oh. Eh.

35:22.703 --> 35:26.206
Look, we're gonna put devil's traps
everywhere, the windows, the door.

35:26.373 --> 35:27.875
We've got holy water...

35:28.042 --> 35:30.419
...an exorcism ready to play on a loop.

35:30.628 --> 35:33.047
And anything comes through that door...

35:35.215 --> 35:37.134
...is meat.

35:37.718 --> 35:40.929
Look, I know this is insane...

35:41.138 --> 35:42.765
...but insane is kind of what we do.

35:43.390 --> 35:45.392
We'll keep you safe.

35:46.894 --> 35:48.020
Okay.

35:48.395 --> 35:50.689
Okay? That's it?

35:52.024 --> 35:53.901
You've done it before.

36:08.415 --> 36:09.792
That's new.

36:09.958 --> 36:12.795
Yeah. I...

36:13.170 --> 36:16.590
His name is Ian.
He works search and rescue.

36:17.091 --> 36:19.093
Guess I have a type.

36:19.760 --> 36:23.472
Our daughter, Bess,
she'll be 1 in a month.

36:27.935 --> 36:30.813
That's, uh, great.

36:31.188 --> 36:33.732
I mean it. I'm really, uh...

36:34.608 --> 36:35.901
I'm really happy for you.

36:37.069 --> 36:38.946
Thanks, Sam.

36:46.829 --> 36:49.748
- What about you?
- Me? Heh.

36:51.625 --> 36:53.460
Pretty much the same, I guess.

36:53.919 --> 36:56.588
No, you're not. You're not the same.

36:58.841 --> 37:01.135
Look, it's been years...

37:01.301 --> 37:05.973
...and I can't even imagine
the things you've been through.

37:07.474 --> 37:10.227
But, I don't know, you just seem...

37:10.811 --> 37:13.105
...more focused, confident.

37:13.313 --> 37:14.648
Like...

37:15.482 --> 37:16.859
Like you know what you want.

37:20.320 --> 37:23.157
- You grew up, Sam.
- Hmm.

37:25.659 --> 37:27.453
I do miss the old haircut, though.

37:37.171 --> 37:38.547
Crowley?

37:38.797 --> 37:39.965
Five...

37:40.174 --> 37:41.300
...four...

37:41.842 --> 37:44.678
...trois, zwei...

37:45.846 --> 37:47.264
...uno.

37:54.897 --> 37:56.982
Sarah. Hey, hey, hey.

37:57.149 --> 37:58.692
Can you hear me?

37:59.401 --> 38:01.236
- Sarah.
- She's dying...

38:01.403 --> 38:04.865
- ...and there's nothing you can do about it.
- You son of a bitch.

38:05.032 --> 38:06.742
Son of a witch, actually.

38:06.909 --> 38:08.702
My mommy taught me a few tricks.

38:08.869 --> 38:10.204
It's a spell.

38:10.370 --> 38:11.872
Find the hex bag.

38:12.039 --> 38:15.334
I thought of sending in
a few of my bruisers...

38:15.542 --> 38:17.211
...really letting them go to town.

38:17.377 --> 38:21.256
But then,
well, trial one was kill a hellhound...

38:21.423 --> 38:24.384
...trial two was
rescue a soul from the pit.

38:24.551 --> 38:28.764
So from here on,
I'm gonna keep everything hell-related...

38:28.931 --> 38:31.558
...demons, et cetera, away from you lads.

38:31.725 --> 38:33.060
Safe side, and all that.

38:33.310 --> 38:37.314
Plus, I just thought it seemed fitting.

38:37.523 --> 38:41.568
From what I understand,
Sammy took that bird's breath away.

38:43.237 --> 38:44.947
What's the line?

38:45.197 --> 38:49.910
Saving people, hunting things,
the family business.

38:50.118 --> 38:52.412
Well, I think the people you save...

38:52.579 --> 38:58.126
...they're how you justify
your pathetic little lives.

38:58.377 --> 38:59.545
The alcoholism...

38:59.962 --> 39:03.924
...the collateral damage,
the pain you've caused.

39:04.132 --> 39:07.135
The one thing that allows you
to sleep at night...

39:07.344 --> 39:11.890
...the one thing,
is knowing that these folks are out there.

39:12.057 --> 39:16.603
Still out there, happy and healthy,
because of you...

39:16.770 --> 39:20.274
...you great big bloody heroes.

39:20.649 --> 39:22.568
Hey, hey. You're gonna be okay.

39:22.734 --> 39:24.361
- They're your life's work.
- Sarah.

39:24.528 --> 39:29.116
And I'm going to rip it apart,
piece by piece.

39:29.283 --> 39:32.661
Because I can.

39:32.870 --> 39:35.747
Because you can't stop me.

39:36.081 --> 39:40.752
And because when they're all gone,
what will you have left?

39:40.961 --> 39:43.255
No. No, no, no.

39:44.965 --> 39:46.133
No, please, no.

39:46.300 --> 39:49.094
You want to keep those people alive?

39:49.303 --> 39:52.097
I want complete and utter surrender.

39:52.306 --> 39:55.392
The tablet, the trials,
you'll give them up...

39:55.601 --> 39:57.978
...or we'll keep doing this dance.

39:58.395 --> 40:00.689
Your choice, my darlings.

40:39.561 --> 40:40.604
You okay?

40:44.816 --> 40:46.735
What do you think?

40:48.570 --> 40:50.364
Look, I know it's bad right now, okay?

40:50.530 --> 40:52.741
But we stick to the plan.
We shut down hell.

40:52.950 --> 40:54.618
How exactly?

40:55.953 --> 40:57.621
- We get a demon...
- You heard Crowley.

40:57.829 --> 40:59.665
He's not gonna let one near us.

40:59.873 --> 41:02.501
And without a demon,
all we can do is sit back...

41:02.668 --> 41:07.547
...and watch people we know,
people we saved, die.

41:07.714 --> 41:08.882
Like Sarah.

41:09.049 --> 41:10.926
So, what are you saying?

41:11.635 --> 41:13.470
I'm saying...

41:14.721 --> 41:16.848
...maybe this isn't one we can win.

41:17.015 --> 41:19.059
Maybe we should just take the deal.

41:22.980 --> 41:24.064
We'll figure this out.

41:24.439 --> 41:26.108
We will.

41:26.400 --> 41:27.442
And we'll get it done.

41:27.609 --> 41:30.404
We'll kick it in the ass,
like we always do.

41:34.783 --> 41:36.284
Are you with me?
