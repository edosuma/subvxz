00:03.640 --> 00:06.376
Leonard, when are you leaving
to pick your mother up from the airport?

00:06.400 --> 00:08.960
Uh... Well, let's see,
her plane gets in at 3:00,

00:09.040 --> 00:11.475
figure half an hour to get her luggage,
so... Never.

00:13.480 --> 00:14.480
Never?

00:14.760 --> 00:16.911
Isn't that usually
when you go to the gym?

00:18.320 --> 00:20.312
Are you really
not gonna pick up your mother?

00:20.400 --> 00:22.790
No, it's fine,
she likes to take a cab or a shuttle.

00:22.880 --> 00:24.439
That way she can meet people.

00:24.520 --> 00:25.560
Well, that's kind of nice.

00:25.600 --> 00:27.637
Yeah, she always says
that a stranger is just

00:27.720 --> 00:30.599
a person whose emotional weak point
you haven't found yet.

00:32.280 --> 00:33.760
Your mom is the best.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.434
Hey, maybe I should pick her up.

00:36.520 --> 00:37.556
You don't drive.

00:37.680 --> 00:39.399
That's what makes
you and me a great team.

00:39.480 --> 00:40.480
Go get your keys.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.235
You can't pick her up.
It'll make me look like a bad son.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.880
I imagine that's one of the things
we'll talk about on the ride.

00:47.880 --> 00:51.476
That and Amy's recent reluctance
to use turn signals.

00:51.560 --> 00:53.472
We were in a parking garage.

00:54.680 --> 00:56.160
Come on, she gave birth to you.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.515
Fine, I'll pick her up.

00:57.600 --> 00:58.431
Good, I'll go with you.

00:58.520 --> 00:59.896
- I call back seat.
- I don't want to be

00:59.920 --> 01:01.559
the only one who doesn't go.

01:01.640 --> 01:03.776
I'll just sit here afraid
that you're all talking about me.

01:03.800 --> 01:05.075
We're not gonna talk about you.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.310
Well, that's my other fear.

01:07.680 --> 01:10.195
This is crazy.
I can pick her up by myself.

01:14.560 --> 01:15.710
So it's just you?

01:17.160 --> 01:20.437
<i>Our whole universe
was in a hot dense state</i>

01:20.520 --> 01:23.638
<i>Then nearly fourteen billion years ago
expansion started...</i>

01:23.720 --> 01:24.720
<i>Wait!</i>

01:24.800 --> 01:25.800
<i>The earth began to cool</i>

01:25.880 --> 01:27.109
<i>The autotrophs began to drool</i>

01:27.200 --> 01:28.759
<i>Neanderthals developed tools</i>

01:28.840 --> 01:30.832
<i>We built a wall
We built the pyramids</i>

01:30.920 --> 01:33.560
<i>Math, science, history
Unraveling the mystery</i>

01:33.640 --> 01:35.552
<i>It all started with the Big Bang!</i>

01:35.640 --> 01:36.756
<i>Bang!</i>

01:45.400 --> 01:46.400
How was your flight?

01:46.440 --> 01:48.796
There were some parents with a baby.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.149
A lot of crying.

01:50.640 --> 01:51.994
Well, babies do that.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.514
No, it was the parents.

01:55.360 --> 01:58.194
It seems they couldn't handle
some constructive criticism.

02:00.560 --> 02:03.075
Uh, hey, on a completely unrelated note,

02:03.160 --> 02:04.992
you know,
if you'd rather stay at a hotel,

02:05.080 --> 02:06.514
we wouldn't be offended.

02:06.600 --> 02:09.638
Actually, I've been
looking forward to staying with you.

02:09.720 --> 02:13.111
Really? It's just,
normally, you stay at a hotel.

02:14.360 --> 02:17.159
- Would you like me to stay at a hotel?
- No, no, no.

02:17.280 --> 02:19.033
I invited you to stay with us.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.273
And I accepted,

02:21.360 --> 02:22.635
so everyone is happy.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.549
Yep.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.350
I'm happy, you're happy,

02:28.840 --> 02:30.752
everyone's happy.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.656
How come
we never eat in the dining room?

02:35.680 --> 02:36.796
Oh, that's for company.

02:41.080 --> 02:42.080
What am I?

02:42.320 --> 02:44.440
Apparently, a guy
who wants to have his feelings hurt.

02:46.440 --> 02:47.880
When does Anu come back from London?

02:48.320 --> 02:50.232
Next week. But it's been good, you know?

02:50.320 --> 02:53.154
Really given me a chance
to focus on myself.

02:53.240 --> 02:54.560
How's that going?

02:54.640 --> 02:57.200
I didn't like what I saw,
got in my car, drove over here.

02:58.880 --> 03:00.439
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

03:00.520 --> 03:01.536
I'm sorry,
I didn't know you had company.

03:01.560 --> 03:03.153
It's all right, neither did they.

03:05.000 --> 03:05.831
Is Stuart home?

03:05.920 --> 03:07.195
No, he's at work.

03:07.280 --> 03:09.556
The last juice.
I'm gonna add it to the list.

03:18.040 --> 03:19.633
That's whose handwriting that is.

03:21.320 --> 03:23.277
I've noticed
she's been over here a lot lately.

03:23.360 --> 03:26.353
You know how you noticed that?
Because you're over here a lot lately.

03:27.480 --> 03:29.676
She has slept over
every night this week.

03:29.760 --> 03:31.433
No, no, she wasn't here Wednesday night.

03:31.600 --> 03:32.431
Yes, she was. You didn't notice

03:32.520 --> 03:34.920
because you were in the hot tub
in the backyard eating Oreos.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.677
That reminds me.

03:40.360 --> 03:41.360
Oreos.

03:44.160 --> 03:45.355
Really?

03:45.440 --> 03:47.272
A photon entanglement team.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.352
Yeah, I'm actually the co-lead.

03:49.440 --> 03:51.830
Yeah, if you like photons
and how they get entangled,

03:51.960 --> 03:53.520
he's your co-guy.

03:54.760 --> 03:56.274
I would enjoy seeing your lab.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.360
Oh!

03:58.960 --> 04:01.191
Yeah, sure. Uh...
If you want, you can come tomorrow.

04:01.720 --> 04:03.120
I look forward to it.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.839
Well, I think I'm going to turn in.

04:04.920 --> 04:06.912
Good night, Penny. Good night, dear.

04:07.400 --> 04:08.600
- Good night.
- Night, Beverly.

04:10.520 --> 04:12.159
Wow, she's being really nice.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.158
Yeah, clearly, one of us is dying.

04:16.240 --> 04:17.240
Come on, her.

04:18.760 --> 04:22.470
Or you accomplished something great,
and she's genuinely proud.

04:22.560 --> 04:23.960
Yeah, all right, you've had enough.

04:28.240 --> 04:29.071
Hi.

04:29.160 --> 04:32.278
<i>- Hey.</i>
- Oh, it's so good to see your face.

04:32.440 --> 04:34.432
How's the concierge conference?

04:34.520 --> 04:37.035
You guys just get theater tickets
for each other all day long?

04:38.880 --> 04:40.155
<i>It's going great,</i>

04:40.240 --> 04:42.400
<i>and the company put me
in a nice place in Notting Hill.</i>

04:42.800 --> 04:45.235
Notting Hill? Like the movie?

04:45.320 --> 04:48.836
"I'm just a boy standing
in front of a girl saying..."

04:48.920 --> 04:50.718
you better bring me home a T-shirt.

04:52.680 --> 04:54.040
I can't wait for you to come home.

04:54.840 --> 04:57.230
<i>Actually, that's one of the reasons
I called.</i>

04:58.480 --> 05:00.631
<i>They offered me a management position.</i>

05:00.720 --> 05:03.235
That's amazing. That's your dream.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.239
<i>It's here in London.</i>

05:06.320 --> 05:07.390
Oh...

05:07.920 --> 05:10.879
<i>And they want me to start right away.</i>

05:11.760 --> 05:13.353
What does that mean for us?

05:13.640 --> 05:17.077
<i>Well, how committed are you
to staying in California?</i>

05:17.720 --> 05:20.838
This is where my work is,
this is where my friends are.

05:21.280 --> 05:22.316
<i>But are you happy?</i>

05:22.400 --> 05:24.278
Not for years. What's your point?

05:28.040 --> 05:30.271
All right,
I got to head out to my drawing class.

05:30.920 --> 05:32.400
Fruit or naked dudes?

05:33.760 --> 05:35.680
Actually, it doesn't matter,
I'm jealous of both.

05:37.560 --> 05:38.960
- I'll see you tonight?
- Yeah.

05:42.160 --> 05:43.753
So she's coming over again, huh?

05:43.840 --> 05:45.638
Yeah, we're gonna do a movie night.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.672
It's my house.
Don't you think you should ask me?

05:50.200 --> 05:51.520
You're right, I'm sorry.

05:52.280 --> 05:54.511
Howard, would you like
to come to movie night?

05:57.240 --> 06:00.312
Doesn't she have her own place?
Why don't you guys hang out there?

06:00.920 --> 06:03.674
She has a roommate,
and he's kind of creepy.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.880
And that's coming from me.

06:08.200 --> 06:11.477
It just feels like
Denise is basically living with us.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.956
You know, maybe you can spend
half the time at her place.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.675
Hey, when I moved in,

06:15.760 --> 06:18.120
you and Bernadette said
it was okay if I brought girls over.

06:18.200 --> 06:20.635
Oh... We were making fun of you.

06:25.400 --> 06:28.711
And this is a high-pulse laser
with a BBO crystal.

06:28.800 --> 06:29.950
It's pretty cool.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.760
It emits photons in discrete bursts.

06:32.880 --> 06:33.791
Hmm.

06:33.880 --> 06:35.553
Very impressive.

06:36.120 --> 06:37.120
But...

06:39.960 --> 06:40.960
But what, dear?

06:41.400 --> 06:42.800
I don't know.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.116
It's just, usually there's a "but"

06:45.200 --> 06:48.830
followed by something
that makes me feel bad.

06:48.920 --> 06:50.434
Ah, Beverly, there you are.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.512
Sheldon, how nice to see you.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.797
Leonard was just showing me his new lab.

06:54.960 --> 06:57.156
Oh, yes, experimental physics,

06:57.240 --> 06:59.630
the carpentry of the science world.
Well...

07:01.160 --> 07:03.550
I'm here to rescue you from the boredom.

07:03.880 --> 07:06.156
Not necessary.
This is really quite interesting.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.200
But...

07:09.960 --> 07:10.960
But nothing.

07:11.600 --> 07:12.636
Oh.

07:12.720 --> 07:14.696
Well, if you want to see something
really interesting,

07:14.720 --> 07:15.720
I could show you my work,

07:15.760 --> 07:17.877
which is being talked about
for a Nobel Prize.

07:17.960 --> 07:19.713
Hmm. Well, I'd love to see it later,

07:19.800 --> 07:21.632
but right now,
I'm spending time with my son.

07:21.720 --> 07:24.189
Ha-ha, I knew
there was a "but"... Wait, what?

07:27.520 --> 07:28.431
Ready?

07:28.520 --> 07:30.557
You sure
I didn't need to see <i>Paddington 1?</i>

07:31.040 --> 07:33.680
He's a bear, he talks, no one knows why.
You're all caught up.

07:35.360 --> 07:36.476
Push play.

07:36.600 --> 07:38.159
May I join you?

07:41.120 --> 07:44.272
Oh. Hey, Mitch, I didn't see you there.

07:44.400 --> 07:47.791
Really? I've been standing here
the whole time.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.917
Well, sure. Yeah, join us.

08:03.040 --> 08:03.917
Movie's up there.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.000
I've seen it.

08:08.440 --> 08:09.840
It's wonderful.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.474
So she's staying in London?

08:16.600 --> 08:18.240
What does that mean
for your relationship?

08:18.320 --> 08:19.549
It's great.

08:19.720 --> 08:22.080
I can see why she would say that,
but why do you?

08:22.840 --> 08:25.674
Well, we got into this
because we both wanted to get married,

08:25.760 --> 08:27.672
and honestly,
we've been dragging our feet,

08:27.760 --> 08:30.116
and I think this
is the push that we need.

08:30.200 --> 08:32.874
Wait, so you're gonna
ask her to marry you?

08:33.200 --> 08:34.270
Why not?

08:34.679 --> 08:37.639
We like each other, plus,
we both want to start a family.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.535
Hey, I can work from anywhere,
I'm an astronomer.

08:39.559 --> 08:40.390
They have stars in London,

08:40.480 --> 08:42.517
and I'm not just talking
about Dame Judi Dench.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.036
No one thought you were.

08:45.360 --> 08:46.360
I thought he was.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.953
So you're really gonna
move halfway across the world?

08:52.440 --> 08:53.476
If she says yes,

08:54.320 --> 08:58.234
and if that's what she wants to do,
then... yeah.

08:58.920 --> 08:59.751
Wow.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.516
Yeah, I know. I'm flying out tomorrow.
I'm gonna surprise her with a ring.

09:03.600 --> 09:04.397
You already have a ring?

09:04.520 --> 09:05.954
Well, it's the same one as before.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.776
I thought you gave it to her
the first time you got engaged?

09:09.800 --> 09:10.916
I did, but I took it back.

09:13.240 --> 09:16.551
So, you're an Indian giver?

09:20.320 --> 09:21.151
Howie.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.960
What? If he's gonna move to England,
I need to get all these out now.

09:26.960 --> 09:29.191
Here you go. Light cream, no sugar.

09:29.280 --> 09:30.634
That's perfect, thank you.

09:30.720 --> 09:34.350
Beverly, I have to say, it's so nice
seeing the two of you get along.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.591
I've always gotten along with Leonard.

09:36.720 --> 09:39.155
Of all of my children,
he's the most docile.

09:41.320 --> 09:43.994
She wrote that in a birthday card once.
I keep it in my nightstand.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.032
Still, it made him so happy
showing you around his lab yesterday.

09:49.640 --> 09:50.640
Interesting.

09:51.800 --> 09:55.589
Would you say that that made him,
much happier than usual,

09:55.680 --> 09:59.674
somewhat happier than usual
or as happy as usual?

09:59.840 --> 10:01.877
Hmm. Multiple choice.

10:01.960 --> 10:05.192
Um, I'm-a go with D,
"that's a weird question."

10:07.400 --> 10:09.278
It made me really happy.

10:09.960 --> 10:12.998
We haven't always had
the easiest relationship.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.958
But, well, looking back,

10:15.040 --> 10:18.875
I guess you were just trying to push me
to be the best version of myself.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.071
So you would say
that my parenting strategies,

10:21.160 --> 10:22.879
although difficult at times,

10:22.960 --> 10:25.794
directly contributed
to your current success?

10:25.880 --> 10:27.776
Well, I may have had
a little something to do with it.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.315
I mean, how often do you wear
your superhero underwear now?

10:32.640 --> 10:35.599
- Only Fridays and my birthday.
- Yeah, that was all me. That was me.

10:35.680 --> 10:39.310
Yeah, that's a fair point.
I hadn't considered your influence.

10:39.400 --> 10:42.279
Perhaps tomorrow
I could observe the two of you together?

10:42.360 --> 10:45.876
Um... "Observe"?
What is going on?

10:46.360 --> 10:48.955
I'm just visiting with my son
and doing research

10:49.040 --> 10:51.919
for my book
on how various parenting strategies

10:52.000 --> 10:54.390
affected my children as adults.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.994
This has all been work to you?

10:59.760 --> 11:02.434
Hanging out with me
and coming to my lab, I...

11:03.880 --> 11:05.872
I thought we were
enjoying each other's company,

11:05.960 --> 11:07.076
but it was just research.

11:07.160 --> 11:09.720
I was enjoying it,
you know I love research.

11:12.160 --> 11:13.196
I can't believe this.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.920
- What? You seem angry.
- Of course I'm angry!

11:18.760 --> 11:21.480
Well, so would you say
that you're somewhat angry,

11:21.560 --> 11:23.517
very angry or extremely angry?

11:24.440 --> 11:26.591
Never mind.
I can see it in your face, dear.

11:33.480 --> 11:36.632
I'm looking over my text correspondence
with Beverly

11:36.720 --> 11:39.189
and I don't see anything
that would have given her offense.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.398
Nothing's ambiguous,
I spell everything out.

11:42.480 --> 11:44.870
Including "laugh out loud"
and "what's the fracas?"

11:46.480 --> 11:48.437
I'm sure she's not mad at you.

11:48.560 --> 11:51.075
Well, then why would she rather
spend the day with Leonard?

11:52.800 --> 11:54.439
Because he's her son?

11:56.240 --> 11:58.152
Amy, I just feel like
we're going in circles.

11:59.600 --> 12:02.240
You... What? No knock? What's the fracas?

12:03.920 --> 12:05.593
I am so stupid.

12:05.680 --> 12:08.593
I actually thought
my mom was genuinely proud of me.

12:08.680 --> 12:11.593
It turns out, she's just using me
as research for her new book.

12:11.680 --> 12:13.080
Oh, what a relief.

12:13.160 --> 12:15.231
I thought Beverly was mad at me.
Thank you, Leonard.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.359
That is a weight off my shoulders.

12:20.120 --> 12:22.715
If you like her so much
you can have her, 'cause I'm done.

12:23.040 --> 12:24.560
Oh, great. Catch the two of you later.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.191
- Sheldon, no.
- Why?

12:27.320 --> 12:29.471
Well, it's an emotionally complex issue.

12:29.600 --> 12:31.353
I don't have time
to explain it right now.

12:31.440 --> 12:33.671
Okay, but that excuse
is running out of steam.

12:37.000 --> 12:39.469
Well, Raj is probably
on his way to the airport.

12:39.560 --> 12:40.755
Yeah.

12:41.400 --> 12:44.518
Guess he's finally getting
his big romantic movie moment.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.800
With a woman who doesn't care about
big romantic movie moments.

12:47.880 --> 12:51.237
Well, he'll have the rest of his life
to explain them to her.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.631
You can't really think
this is a good idea.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.277
Of course I don't.
What am I supposed to do?

12:57.680 --> 12:59.876
Go stop him. Get your best friend back.

13:01.280 --> 13:03.840
- You're my best friend.
- We don't have time for this! Go!

13:07.400 --> 13:11.314
You know, Leonard was really upset.
Shouldn't you go talk to him?

13:11.400 --> 13:14.393
And send the message that he can get
what he wants by throwing a tantrum?

13:14.520 --> 13:15.795
I don't think so.

13:17.800 --> 13:20.998
Beverly, put down your phone
and go apologize to your son.

13:25.800 --> 13:27.519
Oh, so now you're not talking to me?

13:27.600 --> 13:30.195
When you're finished with your tantrum,
I'd be glad to.

13:32.280 --> 13:33.640
Just let me know when you're done.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.478
Oh, my God.

13:36.360 --> 13:39.159
When am I gonna stop
trying to win her approval?

13:39.240 --> 13:41.072
Every time I'm around her,

13:41.160 --> 13:44.278
I turn into this needy
little eight-year-old boy.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.990
You sound like that now
and she's not even here.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.598
If I could respond
more compassionately than Sheldon,

13:54.080 --> 13:56.800
and thank you for making it so easy.

13:58.960 --> 14:02.874
The need for a mother's approval
is baked into our biology.

14:02.960 --> 14:05.077
I know that, it's just...

14:05.160 --> 14:07.959
After all these years,
you'd think I would have learned.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.271
Hmm. It's too bad you didn't.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.477
Well, see? Compassion.

14:20.000 --> 14:22.720
- You okay?
- Yeah. My neck's a little stiff.

14:23.240 --> 14:26.160
Maybe because my boyfriend made me
sleep in a comic book store last night.

14:27.800 --> 14:30.360
Bet your neck would hurt
if you slept in any store.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.078
Except maybe a mattress store.

14:35.280 --> 14:37.636
I'm sorry,
but I couldn't sleep at your place.

14:37.720 --> 14:39.473
Mitch was really freaking me out.

14:39.560 --> 14:42.678
He was freaking me out, too,
but there has to be a better solution.

14:42.760 --> 14:45.514
- Tonight we'll go back to my place.
- And tomorrow?

14:46.880 --> 14:49.714
With my health being what it is,
I try to live one day at a time.

14:51.600 --> 14:52.640
I don't want to blame you,

14:52.720 --> 14:54.616
but if you'd moved in with me
when I asked you to,

14:54.640 --> 14:56.120
we wouldn't be in this situation.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.635
You're right. It's my fault.

15:03.320 --> 15:05.551
When I had the chance, I was scared

15:05.640 --> 15:08.792
and now that I want to,
you're stuck with Mitch.

15:09.360 --> 15:11.431
So you do want to move in with me?

15:12.560 --> 15:15.553
More than Galactus
wants to devour worlds.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.376
Well, that's great 'cause
I want to move in with you

15:19.400 --> 15:21.357
more than the Thing wants to clobber.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.630
More than Hulk wants to smash?

15:26.600 --> 15:29.911
More than Batman wants to ignore
the due process of law.

15:32.400 --> 15:33.914
We are so weird.

15:38.240 --> 15:39.720
Raj! Stop!

15:41.080 --> 15:41.877
What?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.150
What are you doing here?

15:44.320 --> 15:45.320
Look...

15:45.920 --> 15:47.559
If you're getting on that plane

15:47.640 --> 15:49.632
because you love Anu

15:49.760 --> 15:51.240
and you can't stand the thought

15:51.320 --> 15:52.879
of spending another day without her,

15:54.160 --> 15:55.160
then go.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.919
If not, then stay here

15:59.000 --> 16:01.595
with the people who love you.

16:02.440 --> 16:05.558
But what if this is my last chance
at marriage and family?

16:05.640 --> 16:06.790
I promise you it's not.

16:06.880 --> 16:08.758
Believe me, somewhere out there

16:08.840 --> 16:13.995
is a woman who loves cooking shows
and sweater vests

16:14.680 --> 16:16.797
and all the other dumb things you love.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.920
- You really think so?
- Yes.

16:21.320 --> 16:24.711
And I don't think
she's waiting for you in England.

16:26.240 --> 16:28.880
When you propose to someone
in Notting Hill,

16:29.480 --> 16:32.075
it should be to someone
who knows what that movie is.

16:33.600 --> 16:34.716
Are you saying...

16:35.960 --> 16:37.440
you're just a boy,

16:38.920 --> 16:41.151
standing in front of another boy,

16:42.360 --> 16:44.033
saying you don't want him to leave?

16:46.960 --> 16:47.960
Sure.

16:52.600 --> 16:54.080
I love you, buddy.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.074
I love you, too.

16:59.760 --> 17:00.591
No.

17:00.680 --> 17:03.149
No, no,
that's not what's happening here.

17:04.200 --> 17:05.200
Come on.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.695
How'd you get past security?

17:06.720 --> 17:09.234
I had to buy a ticket.
You owe me 1,300 bucks.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.136
Penny, can I have a moment
alone with my...

17:14.160 --> 17:15.160
Yep, bye.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.309
Have you calmed down?

17:20.400 --> 17:22.039
No, I'm not calm. You really hurt me.

17:23.280 --> 17:26.910
- That wasn't my intention.
- It doesn't matter what you intended.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.992
What matters
is the way you made me feel.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.879
Actually, the way
you've always made me feel.

17:34.040 --> 17:35.679
I see, so...

17:35.760 --> 17:38.360
you're here to tell me all the ways
that I failed you as a mother.

17:38.440 --> 17:39.440
Yeah.

17:40.320 --> 17:42.915
And get comfortable,
'cause it's a long list.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.512
Is it happening soon?

17:54.800 --> 17:56.120
You know what? It doesn't matter.

17:58.760 --> 18:00.717
Doesn't matter,
you're never gonna change.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.394
If I want you to accept me for me,

18:05.520 --> 18:08.194
then I guess I'm gonna
have to accept you for you.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.280
So...

18:11.720 --> 18:13.040
I forgive you.

18:14.120 --> 18:17.477
- I didn't ask you to forgive me.
- Too bad. I forgive you anyway.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.232
And I forgive myself
for taking so long to do it.

18:23.320 --> 18:25.596
Oh, my God, that feels so good.

18:29.040 --> 18:30.679
I must admit, it...

18:32.160 --> 18:33.640
It does feel good.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.200
What does?

18:39.560 --> 18:41.358
You forgiving me.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.280
It means a lot.

18:48.640 --> 18:49.790
Thank you.

19:26.200 --> 19:29.557
Look, I was scared to move in,

19:29.640 --> 19:32.394
but that was a mistake
because she is amazing

19:32.480 --> 19:35.040
and I really want to live with her.

19:35.680 --> 19:38.912
So think you'd be willing
to find another place?

19:39.480 --> 19:41.597
- Do you love her?
- We haven't really said that yet.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.353
Yeah, I do.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.477
Don't say it to me, say it to her.

19:49.560 --> 19:50.835
I love you.

19:51.600 --> 19:52.954
I love you, too.

19:55.040 --> 19:56.997
Now both of you say it to me.
