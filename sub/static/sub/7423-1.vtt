03:06.919 --> 03:10.687
What the hell? Guys like me
shouldn't dream anyway.

04:17.786 --> 04:19.920
<i>I'm alive.</i>

04:19.922 --> 04:25.292
<i>And the world shines</i>
<i>for me today.</i>

04:25.294 --> 04:27.360
<i>I'm alive.</i>

04:27.362 --> 04:32.831
<i>Suddenly I am here today.</i>

04:32.833 --> 04:36.601
<i>Seems like forever And a day.</i>

04:36.603 --> 04:40.371
<i>Thought I could never</i>
<i>Feel this way.</i>

04:40.373 --> 04:42.973
<i>Is this really me?</i>

04:42.975 --> 04:46.977
<i>I'm alive.</i>

04:46.979 --> 04:50.680
<i>I'm alive.</i>

04:50.682 --> 04:52.815
<i>I'm alive.</i>

04:52.817 --> 04:58.019
<i>And the dawn breaks</i>
<i>across the sky.</i>

04:58.021 --> 05:00.588
<i>I'm alive.</i>

05:00.590 --> 05:05.625
<i>And the sun rises up so high.</i>

05:05.627 --> 05:09.662
<i>Lost in another world Far away.</i>

05:09.664 --> 05:13.298
<i>Never another word Till today.</i>

05:13.300 --> 05:16.067
<i>But what can I say?</i>

05:16.069 --> 05:19.804
<i>I'm alive.</i>

05:19.806 --> 05:23.607
<i>I'm alive.</i>

05:23.609 --> 05:28.712
<i>I'm alive.</i>

05:46.364 --> 05:49.965
<i>Suddenly came the dawn</i>
<i>From the night.</i>

05:49.967 --> 05:53.702
<i>Suddenly I was born Into light.</i>

05:53.704 --> 05:57.472
<i>How can it be real? I'm alive.</i>

05:57.474 --> 06:01.042
<i>I'm alive.</i>

06:01.044 --> 06:05.012
<i>I'm alive.</i>

06:05.014 --> 06:07.347
<i>I'm alive.</i>

06:07.349 --> 06:12.551
<i>And the world shines</i>
<i>for me today.</i>

06:12.553 --> 06:14.553
<i>I'm alive.</i>

06:14.555 --> 06:20.024
<i>Suddenly I am here today.</i>

06:20.026 --> 06:23.861
<i>Seems like forever And a day.</i>

06:23.863 --> 06:27.364
<i>Thought I could never</i>
<i>Feel this way.</i>

06:27.366 --> 06:30.367
<i>Is this really me?</i>

06:30.369 --> 06:34.371
<i>I'm alive.</i>

06:34.373 --> 06:37.941
<i>I'm alive.</i>

06:37.943 --> 06:43.046
<i>I'm alive.</i>

07:19.149 --> 07:23.151
<i>I'm alive.</i>

07:23.153 --> 07:26.888
<i>I'm alive.</i>

07:26.890 --> 07:30.658
<i>I'm alive.</i>

07:30.660 --> 07:33.894
<i>I'm alive.</i>

07:52.513 --> 07:53.845
What the...

08:00.786 --> 08:04.521
Hey, Sonny. Never thought
we'd see you back here again.

08:04.523 --> 08:06.823
Yeah. Well, I'm not exactly
thrilled about it.

08:06.825 --> 08:09.058
Yeah. You said this place
made you crazy.

08:09.060 --> 08:11.794
I decided I'd rather
be crazy than hungry.

08:13.731 --> 08:17.632
"The calculation is sensitive to the
time you plan to own your house.

08:17.634 --> 08:21.102
"The factor increases if you pay
off your mortgage in five years."

08:21.104 --> 08:22.536
Five years?

08:23.672 --> 08:25.872
He'd be lucky
if he paid off the movers.

08:25.874 --> 08:28.040
Who could pay off a house
in only five years?

08:28.042 --> 08:31.176
Hey, rock stars don't even
need that long. They pay cash.

08:31.178 --> 08:34.245
"A million dollars, man? See my manager.
I'm busy, you know."

08:34.246 --> 08:35.813
Last one in, first one home.

08:35.815 --> 08:36.980
Hey, it's Sonny.

08:36.982 --> 08:39.215
It's Michelangelo Malone.

08:39.217 --> 08:41.784
Michelangelo, glad you're here.
The ceiling needs painting.

08:41.785 --> 08:43.986
Uh-huh, all right,
that's enough.

08:43.988 --> 08:46.989
Well, the great Sonny Malone
returns to AirFlo Records,

08:46.991 --> 08:49.624
welcomed by cheering throngs
of thousands.

08:49.626 --> 08:51.926
Art world fails to suffer.
News at 11:00.

08:51.928 --> 08:53.928
Cut it out.

08:53.930 --> 08:56.263
You know I wouldn't come back
to all this unless I had to.

08:56.265 --> 08:58.131
You know, we were all
really pulling for you.

08:58.133 --> 09:00.867
Yeah, you know, like
one of us breaking away.

09:00.869 --> 09:03.069
Going out on his own.
Really doing it.

09:03.071 --> 09:06.505
Yeah, no paint by numbers, no assembly line art.
So what happened?

09:06.507 --> 09:09.941
It's what didn't happen.
No bread.

09:09.943 --> 09:11.809
I fought it, that's for sure.

09:11.811 --> 09:13.544
Don't worry.

09:13.546 --> 09:16.513
I spend my whole life painting
what other people want.

09:16.515 --> 09:19.215
I paint his van.
I paint somebody else's mural.

09:19.217 --> 09:21.584
I paint Simpson's album covers.

09:21.586 --> 09:24.620
Then when I finally quit
to freelance,

09:24.622 --> 09:26.521
not only do I almost
starve to death,

09:26.523 --> 09:27.989
but I can't figure out
what I wanna do.

09:27.991 --> 09:29.724
Well, you can try it again.

09:29.726 --> 09:31.592
You will, won't you?

09:31.594 --> 09:35.662
Look who decided to drop in.
Where's your white flag?

09:35.664 --> 09:38.598
You have a way with words,
Simpson. You know that?

09:38.600 --> 09:40.733
Same old wise-ass attitude.

09:40.735 --> 09:44.903
I thought we discussed this on the
phone when I decided to take you back.

09:44.905 --> 09:47.906
We did.
But I have one question.

09:47.908 --> 09:49.707
Why the hell did you
take me back?

09:49.709 --> 09:53.143
Simple. You're good, and you're
the fastest painter around.

09:53.145 --> 09:57.113
But this time no more artsy-craftsy
Sonny Malone touches, huh?

09:57.115 --> 09:59.548
Just enlarge the album cover
the way I give it to you.

09:59.550 --> 10:01.550
Am I coming in loud and clear?

10:01.552 --> 10:03.585
Yeah. Good. Here.

10:03.587 --> 10:06.867
You're on your way to your
next masterpiece. Get started.

10:10.025 --> 10:11.257
That's great, isn't it?

10:11.259 --> 10:13.659
Picasso only gets
to be called a genius.

10:13.661 --> 10:16.028
I get to be called
the fastest painter around.

10:16.030 --> 10:19.131
Hey, Sonny, I have this terrific friend.
You interested?

10:19.133 --> 10:21.967
Not right now. Hey.

10:21.969 --> 10:24.002
Mmm, she's great looking.

10:24.004 --> 10:26.671
I think that's this crazy girl
I just ran into.

10:26.673 --> 10:27.938
Yeah? I was walking
through the park.

10:27.940 --> 10:30.907
She nearly ran over me,
then she kissed me.

10:30.909 --> 10:32.942
Okay, now, let's hear
the X-rated version.

10:32.944 --> 10:35.644
What did you do?
Nothing. She took off.

10:35.646 --> 10:37.579
She took off? Come on!

10:37.581 --> 10:40.281
Is this the same Sonny Malone
that drives women crazy?

10:40.283 --> 10:42.249
I'm gonna go find out
who she is.

10:42.251 --> 10:44.635
You mean right now?

10:44.636 --> 10:47.020
Hey, you're definitely gonna be a
successful artist, Malone. You know why?

10:47.022 --> 10:50.256
- Because you're nuts!
- Simpson's gonna kill him.

10:50.258 --> 10:53.325
Listen, Sonny, I told you.
I don't know who she is.

10:53.327 --> 10:56.594
She never filed a W-2
and she never got a check.

10:56.596 --> 10:59.163
And if I never paid her,
she just doesn't exist.

10:59.165 --> 11:00.864
What do you mean,
she doesn't exist?

11:00.866 --> 11:02.966
I'm looking right at her. She's
on the Nine Sisters album.

11:02.968 --> 11:05.268
Not if I didn't pay her,
she isn't!

11:05.270 --> 11:07.837
- Down here at me.
- Now look to your right.

11:07.839 --> 11:09.839
Yeah, that's good.

11:09.841 --> 11:11.273
Listen, Sonny,
I don't know who she is.

11:11.275 --> 11:14.943
How can you not know who she is?
You took the picture.

11:14.945 --> 11:20.381
Listen, this sounds strange, but there
wasn't supposed to be a model on this cover.

11:20.383 --> 11:22.616
I snapped maybe 100 shots.

11:22.618 --> 11:25.251
In one of them, this girl
just jumped into frame.

11:25.253 --> 11:28.120
The next time I saw her
was on the contact sheets.

11:28.122 --> 11:30.722
I liked it, so I used it.
That's the whole story.

11:30.724 --> 11:31.989
She just appeared?

11:31.991 --> 11:35.176
No, no, appeared
then disappeared.

11:35.177 --> 11:38.362
Now, don't you go spreading this around.
This is one of my best covers.

11:38.364 --> 11:40.230
Why do you want to know
who she is, anyway?

11:40.232 --> 11:41.897
I like her.

11:45.302 --> 11:48.202
Hey, Lou. You seen
her around here?

11:48.204 --> 11:52.806
No. Pretty. Hey, you're single, right?
Let me show you my daughters.

11:52.808 --> 11:56.142
That's great, Lou. I'm gonna go
look where I saw her this morning.

11:56.144 --> 11:57.705
Come on, get your balloons.

11:59.079 --> 12:01.145
Seventy-five cents.

12:02.715 --> 12:05.015
- I'll meet you later.
- All right.

12:05.017 --> 12:06.249
Come on, come on over here.

12:06.251 --> 12:08.251
Hi. Hi.

12:08.253 --> 12:10.186
I'll take one, please.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.087
There you go. See you.

12:13.390 --> 12:14.311
All right, come on now.

12:37.044 --> 12:39.844
Hey, mister.
What are you doing up there?

12:41.314 --> 12:44.081
Hope you don't mind
a little noontime music, kid.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.982
A little lunchtime serenade?

12:45.984 --> 12:48.384
I don't mind.
It's kind of nice.

12:48.386 --> 12:50.386
But I was just wondering
where they laid out the body.

12:50.388 --> 12:52.788
I mean, you got something
a little more upbeat?

12:52.790 --> 12:53.988
Sure.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.426
Better? At least it's faster.

13:01.062 --> 13:03.262
Here, give me a hand, kid.
Sure.

13:03.264 --> 13:06.265
Boy, oh, boy, they sure don't
make rocks like they used to.

13:06.267 --> 13:08.734
Want some popcorn?
Yeah, thanks.

13:08.736 --> 13:10.235
You work around here, kid?

13:10.237 --> 13:12.370
Pretty near. I'm over
at AirFlo Records.

13:12.372 --> 13:14.038
You in the music business?

13:14.040 --> 13:16.740
What are you? Are you a record producer?
A sound engineer?

13:16.742 --> 13:19.042
No. I'm sort of a painter.

13:19.044 --> 13:22.078
You, you paint
at a record business?

13:22.080 --> 13:26.182
Well, not exactly paint. What I
do is, I duplicate record covers.

13:26.184 --> 13:28.718
But why?

13:28.719 --> 13:31.253
I make album covers bigger so you can
hang them outside record stores.

13:31.255 --> 13:33.989
Promotion. Sounds like
an interesting job, huh?

13:33.991 --> 13:36.491
Yeah. Sounds like you should
take real long lunch hours.

13:36.493 --> 13:37.925
You got it.

13:37.927 --> 13:39.293
You know, I used to be
in the music business,

13:39.295 --> 13:41.962
but now I'm
what you might call retired.

13:41.964 --> 13:44.097
It's a refined name for "bum."

13:46.501 --> 13:48.434
I don't believe it.

13:48.436 --> 13:51.003
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

13:51.005 --> 13:53.271
Hey, kid. Hey, wait up!
Where are you going?

13:53.273 --> 13:55.806
Hey, you! Come on! Hold on!

13:58.076 --> 14:00.109
Oh, hi. Listen, I gotta borrow this.
I'll bring it back.

14:00.111 --> 14:01.877
Sure. If you bring
it back in person.

14:01.879 --> 14:03.211
You got it.

14:17.191 --> 14:18.123
Hey!

14:23.296 --> 14:26.263
Hey, wait a minute!
Where are you going?

14:36.241 --> 14:38.274
Get that bike off the pier!

14:45.515 --> 14:47.381
Oh, shit!

14:57.492 --> 14:59.391
Whoo!

14:59.393 --> 15:01.926
You're a real Errol Flynn, kid.

15:01.928 --> 15:04.395
What other stunts do you do?

15:04.397 --> 15:06.029
Man, this whole thing
is screwing me up.

15:06.031 --> 15:07.231
What whole thing? Ah, nothing.

15:07.232 --> 15:09.365
Come on, have a cup of coffee.

15:11.635 --> 15:15.503
Sometimes the best person to
tell something to is a stranger.

15:15.505 --> 15:17.972
Go on. What's on your mind?

15:17.974 --> 15:19.173
Okay.

15:20.342 --> 15:22.141
I run into this girl
this morning.

15:22.143 --> 15:23.542
Never saw her before
in my life.

15:23.544 --> 15:25.911
She kisses me and disappears.

15:25.913 --> 15:28.079
So what's so weird about that?

15:28.081 --> 15:30.598
What's so weird about that is

15:30.599 --> 15:33.116
that 10 minutes later I see her picture
on an album cover I'm supposed to paint.

15:33.119 --> 15:35.986
I mean, that's crazy, right?

15:35.988 --> 15:39.923
Well, if I said it sounded crazy,
would you stop looking for her?

15:39.925 --> 15:41.925
No. Then why ask?

15:43.028 --> 15:45.194
So I'll keep looking for her.

15:46.197 --> 15:48.478
Okay, kid, but take
a tip from me.

15:49.466 --> 15:51.532
What's that?

15:51.534 --> 15:53.667
Don't look underwater anymore.

15:55.637 --> 15:57.336
Thanks a lot.

16:02.008 --> 16:03.340
Hey, Al, where you going?

16:03.342 --> 16:05.709
Hey, Sonny.
It's good to see you, man.

16:05.711 --> 16:08.045
How you doing, Big Al?

16:08.046 --> 16:10.380
How could I go wrong with the great
paint job you did on my van?

16:10.382 --> 16:12.081
Hey, and the chicks love it.

16:12.083 --> 16:14.316
Yeah. It's one of the
finer examples of my work.

16:14.318 --> 16:16.184
It's beautiful, man.
Where you headed?

16:16.186 --> 16:17.451
East. Where you going? West.

16:17.453 --> 16:19.519
Hang on. I'll give you a ride.
No, that's cool.

16:19.521 --> 16:23.022
Forget it. I owe you one.
All right. Okay, hit it.

16:25.659 --> 16:29.394
Relax and enjoy it, man.
We're taking the scenic route.

16:29.396 --> 16:32.230
Yeah, just don't forget
I'm back here.

16:37.370 --> 16:39.336
Hey, that's the place
on the album cover!

16:39.338 --> 16:40.603
Slow down, I wanna
get off here.

16:40.605 --> 16:43.272
Here? Thanks for the ride.

16:43.274 --> 16:45.307
Anytime, Sonny.

17:36.458 --> 17:40.493
<i>I've always been in your mind.</i>

17:42.163 --> 17:45.130
<i>You know I will be kind.</i>

17:45.132 --> 17:48.500
<i>I'll be guiding you.</i>

17:48.502 --> 17:51.769
<i>Building your dream.</i>

17:51.771 --> 17:54.638
<i>Has to start now.</i>

17:54.640 --> 17:58.541
<i>There's no other road to take.</i>

18:00.344 --> 18:03.244
<i>You won't make a mistake.</i>

18:03.246 --> 18:07.514
<i>I'll be guiding you.</i>

18:09.050 --> 18:11.150
Wow.

18:11.152 --> 18:15.587
<i>We have to believe</i>
<i>we are magic.</i>

18:15.589 --> 18:20.391
<i>Nothing can stand in our way.</i>

18:20.393 --> 18:25.062
<i>You have to believe</i>
<i>we are magic.</i>

18:25.064 --> 18:29.399
<i>Don't let your aim ever stray.</i>

18:29.401 --> 18:34.102
<i>And if all your hopes survive.</i>

18:34.104 --> 18:38.105
<i>Destiny will arrive.</i>

18:40.109 --> 18:43.442
<i>Bring all your dreams alive.</i>

18:45.112 --> 18:47.479
<i>For you.</i>

18:49.382 --> 18:52.549
<i>Bring all your dreams alive.</i>

18:54.352 --> 18:56.318
<i>For you.</i>

18:59.323 --> 19:00.555
You.

19:01.591 --> 19:02.590
Me.

19:04.126 --> 19:07.460
Hey, I've been asking
about you all day.

19:07.462 --> 19:10.296
You may not believe this, but I'm
painting an album cover and you're on it.

19:10.298 --> 19:12.398
Why shouldn't I believe it?

19:12.400 --> 19:14.867
Because before today,
I never laid eyes on you.

19:14.869 --> 19:17.236
Now I've seen you three times
in one day.

19:17.238 --> 19:19.438
That's a little
too coincidental.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.840
Sounds like
you don't believe it.

19:21.842 --> 19:23.508
Well, with all
that's happened to me today,

19:23.510 --> 19:25.877
to tell you the truth,
I don't believe it.

19:25.879 --> 19:29.881
You're right. It's too coincidental.
Someone must be setting us up.

19:29.883 --> 19:32.116
What do you mean?
Hey, wait a minute!

19:32.118 --> 19:33.617
I didn't have anything
to do with this!

19:33.619 --> 19:34.884
Really?

19:34.886 --> 19:36.852
Yeah, really, I didn't.

19:37.387 --> 19:38.753
Hey!

19:43.526 --> 19:45.859
Who said I was talking
about you?

19:47.195 --> 19:49.461
You come here often?

19:49.463 --> 19:52.564
Yes. I can practice my skating
and no one bothers me.

19:53.500 --> 19:55.366
You must live around here then.

19:55.368 --> 19:57.634
Sometimes.

19:57.636 --> 20:01.270
Say, you think we could...
See each other again?

20:01.272 --> 20:02.871
Yeah. Would you like that?

20:02.873 --> 20:04.372
Why?

20:04.374 --> 20:06.540
I don't know. I don't have
a very good reason.

20:06.542 --> 20:08.783
I'd just like to see you again.

20:09.845 --> 20:11.444
Where are you?

20:13.414 --> 20:14.780
I don't know where
I'm supposed to look.

20:14.782 --> 20:18.316
<i>Bring all your dreams alive.</i>

20:19.752 --> 20:21.184
<i>For you.</i>

20:24.189 --> 20:26.488
We'll see each other again.
Bye, Sonny.

20:29.192 --> 20:30.791
How'd you know my name?

20:33.829 --> 20:36.229
Hey, wait a minute!
I don't know your name.

20:36.231 --> 20:37.596
<i>Kira.</i>

20:40.334 --> 20:41.533
Kira.

20:49.642 --> 20:51.241
I was in big trouble.

20:51.243 --> 20:52.275
So what did you do about it?

20:52.277 --> 20:54.443
Nothing. Hi, Sonny.

20:54.445 --> 20:55.777
What are you doing here?
It's early.

20:55.779 --> 20:57.378
Yeah, it's really early.

20:57.380 --> 20:58.912
I'm working.

20:58.914 --> 21:00.480
Well, that's wonderful.

21:00.482 --> 21:02.782
Oh, hello there.

21:02.784 --> 21:05.184
Why, do you know
you bear a strong resemblance

21:05.186 --> 21:06.685
to a fellow by the name
of Sonny?

21:06.687 --> 21:08.420
Oh, yeah. He works here.

21:08.422 --> 21:13.191
Always comes in late, though.
Say, that's pretty damn good.

21:13.193 --> 21:17.595
It is. It's too good.
That's what's wrong with it.

21:17.597 --> 21:21.231
It is supposed to look exactly
like the album cover I gave you.

21:21.233 --> 21:22.899
Is that too difficult?

21:22.901 --> 21:25.434
If you want me to work,
I'll work.

21:25.436 --> 21:28.270
If you want to stand there and
argue, I can get into that, too.

21:28.272 --> 21:31.573
Don't be a wise ass, Malone.
That painting should be done.

21:31.575 --> 21:33.708
What are you wasting
all this time on the girl for?

21:33.710 --> 21:35.910
Because that's how
she really looks.

21:35.912 --> 21:40.547
I don't give a damn how she really looks.
Just get it finished.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.215
Now, when are you gonna
have it done?

21:42.217 --> 21:44.750
Well, I'd say it probably
will be done

21:46.687 --> 21:48.620
when it's done.

21:48.622 --> 21:50.822
But that's only
an approximate guess.

21:52.826 --> 21:56.427
Five minutes, my office.
If it's six, keep walking.

22:00.266 --> 22:01.932
Sonny, what did you do?

22:04.369 --> 22:07.336
Nobody likes it, but we all
say yes and then forget it.

22:07.338 --> 22:10.238
It goes with the job.
Four minutes.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.572
What difference does it make?

22:11.574 --> 22:13.440
I'll say it's Tuesday,
he'll say it's Wednesday.

22:13.442 --> 22:15.909
So, big deal. Tell him it's Wednesday.
What does it cost?

22:15.911 --> 22:19.279
Oh, nothing.
Maybe just the truth.

22:19.281 --> 22:21.681
Just go in there and agree with him.
That's all he wants.

22:21.683 --> 22:23.482
You want me to say that
Tuesday's Wednesday, right?

22:23.484 --> 22:24.716
Everyday of the week.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.884
Three and a half minutes.

22:26.886 --> 22:28.352
All right!

22:30.289 --> 22:31.954
I'll be right back.

22:34.458 --> 22:35.658
Sit down.

22:40.796 --> 22:42.762
You think you're pretty special
around here, don't you?

22:42.764 --> 22:44.029
No. I never said I was special.

22:44.031 --> 22:45.964
Well, you're not.

22:45.966 --> 22:49.800
I mean, you didn't discover art, you know.
Who do you think did that?

22:51.436 --> 22:53.637
I did. Surprises you,
doesn't it?

22:53.639 --> 22:54.838
No, not really.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.440
Now, I've got an office,

22:57.442 --> 22:59.675
I make a lot of money,

22:59.677 --> 23:02.377
and people respond when I call.

23:02.379 --> 23:05.413
That's because I smartened up
and I gave up art.

23:05.415 --> 23:07.448
I think you made
the right decision.

23:07.450 --> 23:09.934
I want you to smarten up, too.

23:09.935 --> 23:12.419
Start doing things the company way,
not the way you want to do them.

23:12.421 --> 23:15.722
But sometimes I see more in these
covers than what's really there.

23:15.724 --> 23:18.024
That's art.

23:18.026 --> 23:20.493
Just paint what
you're told to paint.

23:20.495 --> 23:22.828
If you start making changes, then
other people start making changes.

23:22.830 --> 23:24.462
And before you know it,
you got a lot of people

23:24.464 --> 23:25.830
running around,
doing what they want to do.

23:25.832 --> 23:28.165
That's not a company.
That's chaos.

23:30.402 --> 23:33.169
Now, I want you to hang
some of your precious covers.

23:33.171 --> 23:36.771
Pick up the van and hustle your
butt over to the Platinum Palace.

23:40.409 --> 23:42.041
Tuesday's Wednesday.

24:05.733 --> 24:07.999
Hey, clarinet. How you doing?

24:08.001 --> 24:10.768
Hey, what do you say, kid.
What're you doing up there?

24:10.770 --> 24:12.035
Trying to get down.
Grab a hold of the ladder.

24:12.037 --> 24:14.070
Sure.

24:14.072 --> 24:16.772
Hey, if we keep meeting like this, we
might as well introduce ourselves.

24:16.774 --> 24:19.007
Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire.

24:19.009 --> 24:21.943
Malone and McGuire.
Sounds like a vaudeville team.

24:21.945 --> 24:23.678
What you got there?
Oh, this is a real gem.

24:23.680 --> 24:24.979
I've been waiting
months for it.

24:24.981 --> 24:26.547
Ah, Glenn Miller.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.949
You wouldn't know about him.
He was before your time.

24:28.951 --> 24:31.484
So was Beethoven,
but I know who he is.

24:31.486 --> 24:32.952
Do you like Glenn Miller?

24:32.954 --> 24:35.054
Do you like rock and roll?
I love rock and roll.

24:35.056 --> 24:36.455
I love Glenn Miller.

24:43.896 --> 24:45.662
This place is incredible.

24:45.664 --> 24:47.797
It belonged to a silent
movie star.

24:47.799 --> 24:51.500
Obviously, they did things
big in those days.

24:51.502 --> 24:53.101
What do you do
with all this space?

24:53.103 --> 24:55.453
Nothing really.

24:55.454 --> 24:57.804
But I love this room because it
makes my records sound great.

24:57.807 --> 25:00.174
Well, I've only got
one thing to say.

25:00.176 --> 25:01.975
Remember, I gave you
some popcorn.

25:01.977 --> 25:05.745
Okay. But you came here
to listen to Glenn Miller.

25:05.747 --> 25:09.148
So, all set up. There he goes.

25:09.150 --> 25:13.485
Nothing like that sound, huh?
That sound was a miracle.

25:13.487 --> 25:14.519
Hey, Danny, that's you.

25:14.521 --> 25:15.820
Yeah.

25:17.123 --> 25:20.057
Hey, this girl...
Danny, there's this girl...

25:20.659 --> 25:21.991
Listen.

25:24.695 --> 25:26.027
That's me.

25:26.029 --> 25:28.896
Hey, that's all right.
You got anymore surprises?

25:30.933 --> 25:33.900
This is what I call
my memorabilia room.

25:33.902 --> 25:36.702
Sort of the story
of Danny McGuire.

25:36.704 --> 25:39.071
Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman.
You really knew those guys?

25:39.073 --> 25:41.573
Yeah. We used to all
hang out together.

25:41.575 --> 25:43.875
After I toured with Miller,
I got my own band

25:43.877 --> 25:47.044
and my own club
on West 51st Street.

25:47.046 --> 25:49.980
It was small and jam-packed,

25:49.982 --> 25:51.948
but everybody who was in town
would drop by.

25:51.950 --> 25:55.284
Sometimes they'd sit in
for a set or two.

25:56.520 --> 25:58.653
Well, now it's a parking lot.

26:00.289 --> 26:01.788
Why did you give it up?

26:01.790 --> 26:03.923
Oh, it was one of those
turning points

26:03.925 --> 26:06.058
where you turn
in the wrong direction.

26:06.994 --> 26:08.760
It was a girl.

26:08.762 --> 26:10.695
The girl on the album.

26:12.031 --> 26:13.030
Yeah.

26:14.700 --> 26:16.933
The singer with the band.

26:16.935 --> 26:21.170
When she left,
I figured she'd be back,

26:21.172 --> 26:23.972
and I wasn't about
to run after her, right?

26:25.241 --> 26:27.641
Boy, did I teach her a lesson.

26:28.644 --> 26:30.577
Never saw her again.

26:32.247 --> 26:34.947
After that, the heart went
out of my music.

26:34.949 --> 26:36.982
I went into the family
construction business

26:36.984 --> 26:39.617
and became what
they call comfortable.

26:40.653 --> 26:42.119
Three cheers for comfort.

26:42.121 --> 26:43.887
You ever think about
going back into music?

26:43.889 --> 26:47.824
No. Only about
20 or 30 times a day.

26:49.661 --> 26:51.794
So, you gonna do it?

26:51.796 --> 26:54.863
Well, I can't play clarinet
like I did in the old days.

26:54.865 --> 26:58.299
But you know something, kid? I'd
love to open up another joint again.

26:58.301 --> 27:00.634
Why don't you?

27:00.636 --> 27:02.936
I've had real estate agents
looking for two years.

27:02.938 --> 27:04.938
They can't find
the right place.

27:04.940 --> 27:07.740
Well, if it's just a place you
want, that seems pretty easy.

27:07.742 --> 27:10.175
No, it's not easy. It's kind
of like falling in love.

27:10.177 --> 27:13.344
You gotta feel a special
attachment, a special...

27:13.346 --> 27:15.813
Like you and your friend...
Kira.

27:15.815 --> 27:17.781
Kira.

27:17.783 --> 27:20.283
Hey, why don't you
help me look?

27:20.285 --> 27:22.184
Maybe you can come up
with something.

27:22.186 --> 27:23.318
Me?

27:23.320 --> 27:24.986
Sure. You've got a good eye.

27:24.988 --> 27:26.687
Stranger things have happened.

27:26.689 --> 27:28.121
Yeah, I guess they have.

27:30.024 --> 27:32.024
Listen, I gotta go.
I understand.

27:32.026 --> 27:34.092
I'll let myself out? Sure.

27:35.228 --> 27:37.895
So long. See you around.

27:43.368 --> 27:45.835
Now how'd that kid figure
out about us?

27:45.837 --> 27:49.171
<i>You made me feel so bad</i>

27:49.173 --> 27:51.339
I guess it still shows on me.

27:53.676 --> 27:59.345
<i>You made me sigh for you.</i>

27:59.347 --> 28:02.047
<i>I didn't wanna tell you.</i>

28:02.049 --> 28:04.248
You're getting old, boy.

28:07.386 --> 28:09.819
I'm getting old, babe.

28:09.821 --> 28:11.987
You wouldn't even know me now.

28:14.024 --> 28:15.656
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

28:15.658 --> 28:16.923
But I'd know you.

28:16.925 --> 28:20.393
<i>You know I do.</i>

28:20.395 --> 28:22.828
<i>Give me, give me...</i>

28:22.830 --> 28:25.397
Yes, I'd certainly know you.

28:26.733 --> 28:28.632
<i>You know you've got</i>
<i>the kind of kisses.</i>

28:28.634 --> 28:32.068
But I remember... everything.

28:32.070 --> 28:34.370
<i>That I'd die for.</i>

28:35.172 --> 28:36.337
Oh!

28:37.306 --> 28:38.405
How I remember.

28:38.407 --> 28:42.175
<i>You made me.</i>

28:42.177 --> 28:42.789
<i>Love you.</i>

28:57.756 --> 29:03.859
<i>No other face could</i>
<i>take you off my mind.</i>

29:04.928 --> 29:07.928
<i>You're so refined.</i>

29:09.431 --> 29:12.131
<i>You're much too kind.</i>

29:13.667 --> 29:16.968
<i>I have to warn you.</i>

29:16.970 --> 29:21.405
<i>I'm never gonna set you free</i>

29:21.407 --> 29:24.841
<i>'Cause I was born to.</i>

29:24.843 --> 29:30.079
<i>Love you for eternity.</i>

29:33.784 --> 29:37.352
<i>Whenever you're away from me.</i>

29:37.354 --> 29:41.723
<i>Wherever you go.</i>

29:41.725 --> 29:45.693
<i>You're never far away from me.</i>

29:45.695 --> 29:50.464
<i>I want you to know.</i>

29:50.466 --> 29:54.367
<i>I only have to close</i>
<i>my eyes dear.</i>

29:54.369 --> 29:58.371
<i>And suddenly I'm where you are.</i>

29:58.373 --> 30:00.072
<i>You better never stray</i>

30:00.074 --> 30:04.209
<i>'Cause I'll never be far away.</i>

30:16.856 --> 30:22.092
<i>On every breeze</i>
<i>I seem to hear your name.</i>

30:23.762 --> 30:26.762
<i>My heart's aflame.</i>

30:28.732 --> 30:32.734
<i>I feel the same.</i>

30:32.736 --> 30:35.870
<i>I'd fall apart dear.</i>

30:35.872 --> 30:40.474
<i>If you'd let the feeling end.</i>

30:40.476 --> 30:43.743
<i>Don't break a heart dear.</i>

30:43.745 --> 30:48.914
<i>Nobody else could mend.</i>

30:48.916 --> 30:52.784
<i>Whenever you're away from me.</i>

30:52.786 --> 30:56.821
<i>Wherever you go.</i>

30:56.823 --> 31:00.791
<i>You're never far away from me.</i>

31:00.793 --> 31:05.762
<i>I want you to know.</i>

31:05.764 --> 31:09.633
<i>I only have to close</i>
<i>my eyes dear.</i>

31:09.635 --> 31:13.603
<i>And suddenly I'm where you are.</i>

31:13.605 --> 31:15.237
<i>You better never stray</i>

31:15.239 --> 31:20.375
<i>'Cause I'll never be far away.</i>

32:50.998 --> 32:52.964
<i>You better never stray</i>

32:52.966 --> 32:57.434
<i>'Cause I'll never be far.</i>

32:58.570 --> 32:59.070
<i>Away.</i>

34:06.368 --> 34:07.600
Hello. Hey!

34:07.602 --> 34:09.168
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:10.103 --> 34:12.337
You scared the hell out of me.

34:12.339 --> 34:14.772
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I tried to be quiet.

34:14.774 --> 34:16.340
How long you been
standing there?

34:16.342 --> 34:17.808
Just a few seconds.

34:17.810 --> 34:20.143
Should I go? Oh, no, stay.

34:20.145 --> 34:22.178
You paint beautifully.

34:22.179 --> 34:25.681
This is the first time I've cared about
what I've painted in a long time.

34:25.683 --> 34:27.416
That's a shame.

34:27.418 --> 34:29.384
It must be frustrating to
waste your talents on things

34:29.386 --> 34:31.552
that don't really matter
to you.

34:31.554 --> 34:34.121
Yeah.

34:34.121 --> 34:36.688
I met a guy the other day. He told
me I should take long lunch hours.

34:36.692 --> 34:38.692
A guy?

34:38.694 --> 34:40.726
Yeah. Someone I met
at the beach.

34:40.728 --> 34:43.596
He's got this crazy idea
he wants to build a club,

34:43.598 --> 34:45.764
and he asked me
if I'd help him find a place.

34:45.766 --> 34:48.399
All the real estate agents in
this town, he asks me, right.

34:48.400 --> 34:51.368
That's not such a crazy idea.
You've got a good eye.

34:51.370 --> 34:54.371
That's what he said.

34:54.373 --> 34:57.139
If it's a place you want,
what about this one?

34:57.141 --> 34:59.242
My place, where we met.

34:59.244 --> 35:01.477
That? Forget it.

35:01.479 --> 35:04.112
I think it has a very special
aura about it.

35:04.114 --> 35:05.546
It's a dump!

35:06.815 --> 35:09.215
You're supposed to be an artist.
Use your imagination.

35:09.217 --> 35:11.750
Thanks a lot, I'm all out.

35:11.752 --> 35:14.419
You know, I really think
you believe that.

35:14.421 --> 35:17.255
I've had enough for tonight.

35:17.257 --> 35:18.456
Come on, let's get out of here.

35:18.458 --> 35:19.423
Okay.

35:24.396 --> 35:26.329
What's this?
Shh, we gotta be quiet.

35:26.331 --> 35:28.097
I thought we were
going skating.

35:28.099 --> 35:30.833
I wanna show you
the special studio first.

35:30.835 --> 35:33.502
Only the biggest groups
get to record here.

35:35.138 --> 35:37.371
It's really kind of magic. Mmm?

35:37.373 --> 35:40.540
Yeah. They flash all sorts
of pictures on screens.

35:40.542 --> 35:42.308
Really? Can we see it?

35:42.310 --> 35:43.742
Straight ahead.

35:45.512 --> 35:49.113
But pictures
in a recording studio? Why?

35:49.115 --> 35:50.481
For inspiration.

35:50.483 --> 35:53.450
Oh, inspiration.
Sounds perfect.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.385
I've only watched them do this
a couple of times before.

35:55.387 --> 35:59.188
Let's see...
Turn on that one. And this.

35:59.190 --> 36:01.157
I don't know how to
make the whole thing work.

36:01.158 --> 36:03.125
Do everything. Go on. Press them all.
I don't wanna break it.

36:03.127 --> 36:05.293
Then press them carefully!
What the hell.

36:05.295 --> 36:07.228
I didn't like the job anyway.

36:07.230 --> 36:08.495
Let's see...

36:08.497 --> 36:10.396
Now will we see the magic?

36:10.398 --> 36:11.864
Sure. Come on.

36:13.434 --> 36:14.900
Careful.

36:21.807 --> 36:28.210
<i>She walks in,</i>
<i>and I'm suddenly a hero.</i>

36:29.513 --> 36:35.850
<i>I'm taken in,</i>
<i>my hopes begin to rise.</i>

36:41.189 --> 36:43.689
<i>Look at me.</i>

36:45.192 --> 36:50.928
<i>Can't you tell</i>
<i>I'd be so thrilled to see.</i>

36:52.231 --> 36:53.797
<i>The message in your eyes.</i>

36:53.799 --> 36:56.466
<i>You make it seem</i>
<i>I'm so close to my dream.</i>

36:56.468 --> 36:59.469
<i>And then suddenly</i>
<i>it's all there.</i>

36:59.471 --> 37:03.906
<i>Suddenly the wheels</i>
<i>are in motion.</i>

37:03.908 --> 37:06.575
<i>And I.</i>

37:06.577 --> 37:11.546
<i>I'm ready to sail any ocean.</i>

37:11.548 --> 37:16.217
<i>Suddenly I don't need</i>
<i>the answers</i>

37:16.219 --> 37:18.953
<i>'Cause I.</i>

37:18.955 --> 37:24.825
<i>I'm ready to take</i>
<i>all my chances with you.</i>

37:38.940 --> 37:41.807
<i>And how can I.</i>

37:43.377 --> 37:46.678
<i>Feel you're all that matters.</i>

37:46.680 --> 37:52.817
<i>I'd rely on anything you say.</i>

37:58.724 --> 38:02.392
<i>I'll take care.</i>

38:02.394 --> 38:06.429
<i>That no illusions shatter.</i>

38:06.431 --> 38:11.267
<i>If you dare to say</i>
<i>what you should say.</i>

38:11.269 --> 38:14.003
<i>You make it seem</i>
<i>I'm so close to my dream.</i>

38:14.005 --> 38:16.772
<i>And then suddenly</i>
<i>it's all there.</i>

38:16.774 --> 38:21.476
<i>Suddenly the wheels</i>
<i>are in motion.</i>

38:21.478 --> 38:24.278
<i>And I.</i>

38:24.280 --> 38:29.316
<i>I'm ready to sail any ocean.</i>

38:29.318 --> 38:33.753
<i>Suddenly I don't need</i>
<i>the answers</i>

38:33.755 --> 38:36.622
<i>'Cause I.</i>

38:36.624 --> 38:42.761
<i>I'm ready to take</i>
<i>all my chances with you.</i>

38:58.578 --> 39:03.279
<i>Why do I feel so alive.</i>

39:03.281 --> 39:05.014
<i>When you're near.</i>

39:05.016 --> 39:08.283
<i>There's no way any hurt.</i>

39:08.285 --> 39:12.687
<i>Can get through.</i>

39:12.689 --> 39:18.926
<i>Longing to spend every moment</i>
<i>of the day.</i>

39:18.928 --> 39:22.796
<i>With you.</i>

39:22.798 --> 39:27.467
<i>With you.</i>

39:27.469 --> 39:31.871
<i>Suddenly the wheels</i>
<i>are in motion.</i>

39:31.873 --> 39:34.607
<i>And I.</i>

39:34.609 --> 39:39.745
<i>I'm ready to sail any ocean.</i>

39:39.747 --> 39:44.049
<i>Suddenly I don't need</i>
<i>the answers</i>

39:44.051 --> 39:46.885
<i>'Cause I.</i>

39:46.887 --> 39:52.891
<i>I'm ready to take</i>
<i>all my chances with you.</i>

39:59.799 --> 40:02.065
Hey! What the hell's
going on in here?

40:03.034 --> 40:04.933
Malone! Is that you?

40:04.935 --> 40:08.836
Yes! No, it's not me.
It's somebody else.

40:08.838 --> 40:12.039
Do you have any idea how much
this equipment costs? Huh?

40:12.608 --> 40:14.674
Oh, shit!

40:14.676 --> 40:16.575
That was great. You were great.

40:16.577 --> 40:18.076
Our first dance together.

40:18.078 --> 40:20.478
Followed by our first
being-kicked-out together.

40:21.814 --> 40:24.014
Now I want to go somewhere else.
Where?

40:24.016 --> 40:25.715
Find out more about you.

40:27.118 --> 40:30.018
You know enough about me.
I wanna know about you.

40:30.020 --> 40:31.886
I'm serious.

40:31.888 --> 40:34.655
So am I.

40:34.657 --> 40:37.524
Well, after all that, do you think you'd
let your imagination roam a little?

40:37.526 --> 40:40.393
Look, I won't even start
in on that one.

40:41.896 --> 40:43.562
What are you doing?

40:43.564 --> 40:46.097
What do you think you're doing?
Oh, nothing.

40:46.099 --> 40:50.834
Oh. Well, well, well.
Now, what a coincidence.

40:51.970 --> 40:54.770
Look where we just happened
to end up.

40:56.473 --> 40:59.107
You think you're real clever,
don't you?

40:59.108 --> 41:02.508
Well, I just didn't want you to close
your eyes to any possibilities.

41:03.412 --> 41:05.812
You really think
this could work out for Danny?

41:05.814 --> 41:08.948
I think this place could be
anything you want it to be.

41:10.451 --> 41:14.419
See, it's simple.
Your friend has a dream,

41:14.421 --> 41:18.456
and you want to be involved in
something you really believe in.

41:18.458 --> 41:22.793
Well, maybe his dream is big
enough for the both of you.

41:22.795 --> 41:26.029
So here we are. Someone who believes
that dreams come easy, and...

41:26.031 --> 41:30.033
Someone who doesn't know
what they believe in.

41:30.035 --> 41:33.636
So just think about it, okay?
Just think about it.

41:46.650 --> 41:49.183
You gotta be kidding.
This place?

41:49.185 --> 41:50.884
They used to have
wrestling here.

41:50.886 --> 41:53.586
So it's got
a history of success.

41:53.588 --> 41:56.188
It needs some fixing up. I
think it could look terrific.

41:56.190 --> 41:58.156
So could the <i> Titanic.</i>

41:58.158 --> 42:02.026
Kid, you don't need a builder.
You need a demolition team.

42:02.028 --> 42:04.795
Look, I know it's a wreck now, but
I can see it coming to life again.

42:04.797 --> 42:06.830
Just check it out, Danny.
That's all I'm asking.

42:06.832 --> 42:08.998
Well, what put you onto this?

42:09.000 --> 42:10.132
A girl.

42:10.134 --> 42:13.602
Oh, that explains everything.

42:13.604 --> 42:18.506
Hey, Danny, don't you think there's a
certain kind of aura about this place?

42:18.508 --> 42:21.642
Well, if that's what you call
it, it's got it all right.

42:21.644 --> 42:24.077
Let's see the rest of it.

42:24.079 --> 42:27.447
Of course, it's not small and
intimate like my club in New York.

42:27.449 --> 42:32.951
But then again, that was back in
1945 and things are bigger now.

42:32.953 --> 42:36.554
And this place...
Whoo. Sure is big.

42:36.556 --> 42:37.922
Yeah, it is.

42:37.924 --> 42:40.491
Yeah. Well, I don't know.
I don't know.

42:40.493 --> 42:43.660
Naturally, I can't take
all this too seriously.

42:43.662 --> 42:47.664
But if I were going to do something
about it, and I can't say I am

42:47.666 --> 42:49.198
because, you see,
I'm a builder,

42:49.200 --> 42:52.669
and a builder has to take his
time deciding these things.

42:52.671 --> 42:56.072
But if I were going to
do something about it,

42:56.074 --> 43:01.177
just speaking hypothetically,
it just might work.

43:01.179 --> 43:02.745
You think so?

43:02.747 --> 43:04.913
Might. If I planned it right.

43:05.949 --> 43:09.216
Let's see... Stage over there.

43:09.218 --> 43:12.986
Stairs there and there
and back there.

43:12.988 --> 43:15.088
Kid, can you imagine it?
Imagine what?

43:15.090 --> 43:17.123
A bandstand right over there
in that corner.

43:17.125 --> 43:19.892
And a big band,
like in the '40s.

43:25.631 --> 43:29.933
No, no, no. Bandstands went out
with running boards. Over there...

43:29.935 --> 43:33.036
- A great rock and roll band.
- This is the '80s.

43:39.643 --> 43:42.944
Real smooth dancers.
Wild trombone.

43:42.946 --> 43:45.746
The band decked out in tuxedos.

43:51.186 --> 43:53.085
Six guys wearing
electric orange.

43:53.087 --> 43:56.854
Synthesizer, heavy percussion,
electric guitar.

44:04.862 --> 44:08.262
Lots of glamour. Everybody
dressed in elegance and style.

44:39.158 --> 44:41.158
Do it, Daddy, do it.

44:48.233 --> 44:49.432
Yeah, man.

44:50.668 --> 44:51.967
Yes!

45:24.166 --> 45:26.799
<i>Anybody blue.</i>

45:26.801 --> 45:31.803
<i>Anybody needing someone, too.</i>

45:31.805 --> 45:36.706
<i>Anyone feeling cold.</i>

45:36.708 --> 45:42.745
<i>No one there you can hold.</i>

45:42.747 --> 45:44.713
<i>Don't wait to get old and gray.</i>

45:44.715 --> 45:47.115
<i>I'm gonna blow</i>
<i>all the clouds away</i>

45:47.117 --> 45:51.218
<i>'Cause there is nothing</i>
<i>I would rather do.</i>

45:54.223 --> 45:59.192
<i>Forget about the blues</i>
<i>tonight, sweet thing.</i>

45:59.194 --> 46:04.230
<i>Forget about the rules</i>
<i>tonight, sweet thing.</i>

46:04.232 --> 46:07.032
<i>I want to dance with you.</i>

46:07.034 --> 46:09.267
<i>Until the sun comes</i>
<i>creeping through.</i>

46:09.269 --> 46:12.103
<i>I want to dance with you.</i>

46:12.105 --> 46:14.371
<i>I won't stop pleasing you.</i>

46:19.044 --> 46:21.778
<i>Honey, for a while.</i>

46:21.780 --> 46:26.482
<i>Give a girl a chance</i>
<i>to show some style.</i>

46:26.484 --> 46:31.453
<i>If you've got no love to spare.</i>

46:31.455 --> 46:34.055
<i>Tell me lies.</i>

46:34.057 --> 46:36.524
<i>I don't care.</i>

46:37.460 --> 46:39.259
<i>You better believe that I.</i>

46:39.261 --> 46:42.295
<i>I know some moves</i>
<i>that we've gotta try</i>

46:42.297 --> 46:45.831
<i>'Cause there is nothing</i>
<i>I would rather do.</i>

46:49.036 --> 46:54.105
<i>Forget about the blues</i>
<i>tonight, sweet thing.</i>

46:54.107 --> 46:59.210
<i>Forget about the rules</i>
<i>tonight, sweet thing.</i>

46:59.212 --> 47:01.946
<i>I want to dance with you.</i>

47:01.948 --> 47:04.214
<i>Until the sun comes</i>
<i>creeping through.</i>

47:04.216 --> 47:06.916
<i>I want to dance with you.</i>

47:06.918 --> 47:09.151
<i>I won't stop pleasing you.</i>

47:24.935 --> 47:28.002
<i>Lover, I wanna let you know.</i>

47:28.004 --> 47:30.037
<i>I won't take a backseat.</i>

47:30.039 --> 47:33.073
<i>Ain't willing to let you go.</i>

47:33.075 --> 47:34.908
<i>I won't take a backseat.</i>

47:34.910 --> 47:37.343
<i>Don't wanna hear what you want.</i>

47:37.345 --> 47:40.112
<i>It's gotta be all my way.</i>

47:40.114 --> 47:42.446
<i>And I'm making sure</i>
<i>you stay to see.</i>

47:44.850 --> 47:47.383
<i>I'm really a selfish man.</i>

47:47.385 --> 47:50.219
<i>I gotta get right to it.</i>

47:50.221 --> 47:53.222
<i>Lover, tonight</i>
<i>I'm thinking of me.</i>

47:54.825 --> 47:58.159
<i>Lover, I won't take</i>
<i>a backseat tonight.</i>

47:59.829 --> 48:03.296
<i>Lover, getting on my</i>
<i>two feet tonight.</i>

48:05.233 --> 48:07.600
<i>Got some dancing to do.</i>

48:07.602 --> 48:10.002
<i>Got some dancing to do.</i>

48:10.004 --> 48:12.437
<i>Got some dancing to do.</i>

48:12.439 --> 48:14.906
<i>Got some dancing to do.</i>

48:24.617 --> 48:27.918
<i>Can't let anyone dance</i>
<i>with you.</i>

48:27.920 --> 48:29.586
<i>I won't take a backseat.</i>

48:29.588 --> 48:32.922
<i>Let me show you what I can do.</i>

48:32.924 --> 48:34.590
<i>I won't take a backseat.</i>

48:34.592 --> 48:37.392
<i>Ain't funny to fool with me.</i>

48:37.394 --> 48:39.627
<i>I'll be a bad loser.</i>

48:39.629 --> 48:42.563
<i>You're getting me mad,</i>
<i>using me.</i>

48:44.567 --> 48:47.301
<i>Tried putting a spell on me</i>

48:47.303 --> 48:49.970
<i>'Cause I had a strange feeling.</i>

48:49.972 --> 48:52.872
<i>You better get down</i>
<i>to healing me.</i>

48:54.542 --> 48:58.076
<i>Lover, I won't take</i>
<i>a backseat tonight.</i>

48:59.512 --> 49:03.112
<i>Lover, getting on my</i>

49:04.982 --> 49:07.482
<i>Got some dancing to do.</i>

49:07.484 --> 49:10.051
<i>Got some dancing to do.</i>

49:10.053 --> 49:12.420
<i>Got some dancing to do.</i>

49:12.422 --> 49:14.355
<i>Got some dancing to do.</i>

49:23.466 --> 49:25.299
<i>Forget about the blues</i>
<i>tonight, sweet thing.</i>

49:25.301 --> 49:28.268
<i>Lover, I won't take</i>
<i>a backseat tonight.</i>

49:28.270 --> 49:30.236
<i>Forget about the rules</i>
<i>tonight, sweet thing.</i>

49:30.238 --> 49:33.672
<i>Lover, getting on my</i>
<i>two feet tonight.</i>

49:33.674 --> 49:36.374
<i>I want to dance with you</i>
<i>Got some dancing to do.</i>

49:36.376 --> 49:38.542
<i>Until the sun comes creeping
through Got some dancing to do.</i>

49:38.544 --> 49:41.611
<i>I want to dance with you</i>
<i>Got some dancing to do.</i>

49:41.613 --> 49:43.446
<i>I won't stop pleasing you</i>
<i>Got some dancing to do.</i>

49:43.448 --> 49:45.247
<i>Forget about the blues</i>
<i>tonight, sweet thing.</i>

49:45.249 --> 49:48.316
<i>Lover, I won't take</i>
<i>a backseat tonight.</i>

49:48.318 --> 49:50.184
<i>Forget about the rules</i>
<i>tonight, sweet thing.</i>

49:50.186 --> 49:53.620
<i>Lover, getting on my</i>
<i>two feet tonight.</i>

49:53.622 --> 49:56.055
<i>I want to dance with you</i>
<i>Got some dancing to do.</i>

49:56.057 --> 49:58.190
<i>Until the sun comes creeping
through Got some dancing to do.</i>

49:58.192 --> 50:01.159
<i>I want to dance with you</i>
<i>Got some dancing to do.</i>

50:01.161 --> 50:03.995
<i>I won't stop pleasing you</i>
<i>Got some dancing to do</i>

50:09.501 --> 50:12.068
I love it! I'll do it!

50:12.070 --> 50:14.403
Maybe I'm crazy,
but what the hell!

50:14.405 --> 50:16.638
I haven't been crazy
for over 35 years.

50:16.640 --> 50:20.141
I'm gonna do it. And, kid, I'm
giving you half the place.

50:20.143 --> 50:22.276
You're gonna be my partner.

50:22.278 --> 50:24.211
I can't do that, Danny.
I can't take that.

50:24.213 --> 50:25.679
Why?

50:25.681 --> 50:27.514
I don't know the first thing
about being a partner.

50:27.516 --> 50:32.552
Well, it's easy. We share the
responsibilities and we argue a lot.

50:32.554 --> 50:35.021
It's like being married,
without the good part.

50:37.025 --> 50:39.325
Come on, kid. Is it a deal?

50:39.327 --> 50:40.726
Okay. It's a deal.

50:40.728 --> 50:42.594
What do you know!

50:42.596 --> 50:44.596
I'm back in show business.

50:44.598 --> 50:48.166
Now, I can't wait. I gotta look
over every inch of this place.

50:48.168 --> 50:49.700
I only wish
we could see better.

50:49.702 --> 50:51.168
I got a flashlight in the car.

50:51.170 --> 50:53.170
Will you get it? Yeah.

50:53.172 --> 50:56.072
It's our first collaboration
as partners.

50:56.074 --> 50:59.675
And, oh, partner? Partner,
what'll we name the place?

51:05.281 --> 51:08.148
Yeah. What the hell to call it?

51:12.420 --> 51:17.189
"In Xanadu did Kubla Khan A
stately pleasure-dome decree..."

51:21.361 --> 51:24.328
"Where Alph,
the sacred river, ran.

51:24.330 --> 51:27.164
"Through caverns measureless
to man.

51:27.166 --> 51:29.666
"Down to a sunless sea."
"Down to a sunless sea."

51:29.668 --> 51:32.201
Yes, Xanadu.

51:32.203 --> 51:34.770
I'm Kira. Of course.

51:35.339 --> 51:36.671
You're Kira.

51:37.440 --> 51:39.506
But... But?

51:39.508 --> 51:43.009
I mean... Don't I know you?

51:44.078 --> 51:45.444
I don't think so.

51:47.714 --> 51:49.547
Are you sure because...

51:49.549 --> 51:51.148
Because?

51:51.150 --> 51:56.052
Well, I mean... I don't know.
I was thinking that I...

51:56.054 --> 51:58.454
Oh, I'm sorry. Forget it.

51:59.523 --> 52:01.523
So, you're gonna do it?

52:02.158 --> 52:04.725
Yes, we're gonna do it.

52:04.727 --> 52:07.494
Total insanity.
Only if you think so.

52:07.496 --> 52:10.763
Well, even if it is,
it's worth a try.

52:13.634 --> 52:17.435
Xanadu. How do you think
that'll look on a marquee?

52:18.271 --> 52:21.272
- Hmm, wonderful.
- Hey!

52:21.274 --> 52:24.575
When did you get here?
Just a minute ago.

52:24.577 --> 52:28.378
What'd I tell you, Danny? One minute
she's here, the next minute, who knows?

52:28.380 --> 52:31.080
Guess what you own
half of, partner.

52:31.082 --> 52:32.281
What?

52:32.583 --> 52:34.416
Xanadu.

52:34.418 --> 52:36.751
Xanadu. Xanadu.

52:39.922 --> 52:41.521
Hi, guys.

52:41.523 --> 52:43.289
Hey, Picasso. Hey.

52:43.291 --> 52:44.923
How you doing?

52:46.760 --> 52:49.494
Let's see, what's first
on the agenda?

52:52.232 --> 52:54.513
- Hey, who are you calling?
- Leave a dime on the counter.

52:55.735 --> 52:57.835
Hello, Simpson? Sonny Malone.

52:57.837 --> 52:59.803
I wanna see you right away.

52:59.805 --> 53:01.822
Hey, what's going on here?

53:01.823 --> 53:03.840
Who cares what's going on. Just
get out before he gets here.

53:03.842 --> 53:05.641
Yeah. I'll fix everything up.
I'll tell him it was a joke.

53:05.643 --> 53:08.543
Hey, wait a minute. Relax. It's okay.
Are you loaded?

53:08.545 --> 53:10.278
Because, when you sober up,
you're gonna be real sorry.

53:10.280 --> 53:12.380
He should be coming in
just about now.

53:12.382 --> 53:14.749
Malone, what the hell
is going on?

53:14.751 --> 53:18.953
Simpson, I've worked like a dog
trying to make Tuesday Wednesday.

53:18.955 --> 53:21.554
I couldn't do it.
I must be a failure.

53:23.891 --> 53:25.657
Is he straight?

53:25.658 --> 53:27.424
You told me if I didn't do things
the right way, I'd be fired.

53:27.427 --> 53:28.826
Well, you were right.

53:28.828 --> 53:29.693
Huh?

53:30.562 --> 53:32.762
I'm fired!

53:32.764 --> 53:35.431
Malone, I want you
out of here in five minutes.

53:35.433 --> 53:39.735
That's five minutes, Malone, and if
it's six, just keep walking. Got it?

53:39.737 --> 53:42.904
I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
I'm doing it!

53:42.906 --> 53:44.705
You know that dream of mine
to get out of here?

53:44.707 --> 53:46.807
Well, it's happening,
and you're all invited.

53:46.809 --> 53:50.944
Opening night, whatever
you want, it's on the house.

53:50.946 --> 53:53.646
You know, I always wanted
to say that line.

54:00.487 --> 54:01.686
Shit.

54:07.859 --> 54:09.625
Okay.

54:11.996 --> 54:14.596
To Xanadu. To dreams.

54:14.598 --> 54:16.731
I couldn't have done
it without you.

54:18.568 --> 54:19.767
How is it?

54:19.769 --> 54:21.235
Heavenly.

54:21.237 --> 54:23.336
You're the one that's heavenly.

54:25.773 --> 54:27.639
No, don't.

54:27.641 --> 54:30.775
What's the matter?
Did I do something?

54:30.777 --> 54:32.777
No.

54:32.779 --> 54:35.012
You know, I don't know
anything about you.

54:35.014 --> 54:37.447
Where you live,
where you were born.

54:37.449 --> 54:39.015
There's nothing to know.

54:39.017 --> 54:40.816
Where do you live?

54:40.818 --> 54:42.484
With my sisters.

54:42.486 --> 54:44.619
Where? In an apartment.

54:44.621 --> 54:46.320
Yeah, but where's
the apartment?

54:46.322 --> 54:47.921
On the second floor.

54:47.923 --> 54:49.756
Look, I don't even know
how to find you.

54:49.758 --> 54:52.425
Yeah, but you always do. Okay.

54:52.994 --> 54:55.327
That's a dead end.

54:55.329 --> 54:56.795
What's your last name?

54:56.797 --> 54:58.463
Same as my father's
and mother's.

54:58.465 --> 55:00.798
Yeah, but what is it? What?
My father's or my mother's?

55:00.800 --> 55:03.734
I don't care. Either one.
Same as mine.

55:03.736 --> 55:05.936
Okay, I get it. No questions.

55:06.738 --> 55:08.671
No questions, no lies.

55:09.607 --> 55:11.740
No questions, no truth either.

55:11.742 --> 55:13.708
Listen, you know enough
about me already.

55:13.710 --> 55:15.943
Any more, you're gonna
get a headache.

55:15.945 --> 55:18.011
Are you living with somebody?

55:18.513 --> 55:20.679
Yes.

55:20.681 --> 55:23.982
I'm living with my sisters.
I told you already.

55:23.984 --> 55:27.285
Yeah, I know, in an apartment
on the second floor.

55:49.976 --> 55:53.744
<i>Why do I say.</i>

55:53.746 --> 55:55.879
<i>Don't walk away.</i>

55:57.582 --> 56:01.450
<i>You'll be the way</i>
<i>you were before.</i>

56:01.452 --> 56:05.487
<i>When you don't want me anymore.</i>

56:05.489 --> 56:07.055
<i>Don't turn around.</i>

56:08.992 --> 56:10.992
<i>Don't ever leave.</i>

56:12.762 --> 56:16.563
<i>A lonely room where empty days.</i>

56:16.565 --> 56:19.632
<i>Are gathering to meet me.</i>

56:19.634 --> 56:21.667
<i>When you're gone.</i>

56:22.569 --> 56:24.435
<i>Gone.</i>

56:24.437 --> 56:29.105
<i>How in the world will I go on?</i>

56:29.107 --> 56:33.843
<i>Don't walk away.</i>

56:33.845 --> 56:36.946
<i>All you gotta do is stay.</i>

56:36.948 --> 56:41.517
<i>Don't walk away.</i>

56:41.519 --> 56:44.586
<i>All you gotta do is stay.</i>

56:44.588 --> 56:49.823
<i>Don't walk away.</i>

56:49.825 --> 56:51.724
<i>Don't walk away.</i>

56:51.726 --> 56:53.625
<i>Don't walk away.</i>

56:53.627 --> 56:55.460
<i>Don't say goodbye.</i>

56:55.462 --> 56:57.094
<i>Don't say goodbye.</i>

56:57.096 --> 56:59.396
<i>Don't turn around.</i>

56:59.398 --> 57:01.698
<i>Don't turn around.</i>

57:01.700 --> 57:03.066
<i>Don't let it die.</i>

57:03.068 --> 57:05.068
<i>Don't let it die.</i>

57:05.070 --> 57:06.903
<i>When shadows fall.</i>

57:06.905 --> 57:08.838
<i>When shadows fall.</i>

57:08.840 --> 57:10.906
<i>When day is done.</i>

57:10.908 --> 57:12.607
<i>When day is done.</i>

57:12.609 --> 57:14.508
<i>All through the night.</i>

57:14.510 --> 57:16.376
<i>All through the night.</i>

57:16.378 --> 57:18.077
<i>All of my life.</i>

57:18.079 --> 57:20.579
<i>All of my life.</i>

57:22.583 --> 57:27.751
<i>Don't walk away.</i>

57:27.753 --> 57:29.586
<i>Don't walk away.</i>

57:29.588 --> 57:31.521
<i>Don't walk away.</i>

57:31.523 --> 57:33.489
<i>Don't say goodbye.</i>

57:33.491 --> 57:35.090
<i>Don't say goodbye.</i>

57:35.092 --> 57:37.125
<i>Don't turn around.</i>

57:37.127 --> 57:39.494
<i>Don't turn around.</i>

57:39.496 --> 57:40.928
<i>Don't let it die.</i>

57:40.930 --> 57:42.796
<i>Don't let it die.</i>

57:42.798 --> 57:44.798
<i>When shadows fall.</i>

57:44.800 --> 57:46.533
<i>When shadows fall.</i>

57:46.535 --> 57:48.568
<i>When day is done.</i>

57:48.570 --> 57:50.570
<i>When day is done.</i>

57:50.572 --> 57:52.171
<i>All through the night.</i>

57:53.107 --> 57:54.906
All right.

57:54.908 --> 57:57.408
Come on, you guys,
does anyone want some more?

57:57.410 --> 57:59.943
Hey, hey. Give me a break. It's
only the end of the first week.

57:59.945 --> 58:02.146
So what? We're gonna celebrate
at the end of every week.

58:02.147 --> 58:03.946
All right. I won't argue
with that. Cheers.

58:03.948 --> 58:06.648
Two cheers. Two cheers.

58:06.650 --> 58:08.916
You know, when you guys told
me you were building a dream,

58:08.918 --> 58:10.951
I thought you were crazy. Yeah?

58:10.953 --> 58:14.154
Most people want skyscrapers
you put up in 20 minutes.

58:14.156 --> 58:16.589
It's gonna be beautiful in there.
Thank you.

58:16.591 --> 58:19.725
All right. See you guys next week.
You bet.

58:19.727 --> 58:24.963
Hey, Sonny, I thought we should have
one special toast, just the two of us.

58:24.965 --> 58:26.798
I've never had
a partner before.

58:26.800 --> 58:29.767
I've never watched
a dream come true.

58:29.769 --> 58:32.736
Hey, there's not much left.
But, still vintage.

58:32.738 --> 58:34.771
Only the best.

58:34.773 --> 58:37.173
To Sonny Malone. Danny McGuire.

58:37.175 --> 58:39.108
And Glenn Miller.

58:39.110 --> 58:40.776
Hello.

58:41.478 --> 58:42.944
How's it all going?

58:42.946 --> 58:45.680
So far so good.

58:45.682 --> 58:47.748
Kira, I want you
to promise me one thing.

58:47.750 --> 58:49.015
Anything.

58:49.017 --> 58:51.183
On opening night,
I get the first dance.

58:51.185 --> 58:53.585
Okay. You're gonna dance?

58:53.587 --> 58:56.454
Oh, I've been known
to twinkle a toe or two.

58:56.456 --> 59:00.024
Listen, if you're gonna dance,
you have to wear something...

59:00.026 --> 59:02.526
That looks special.
You need some...

59:02.528 --> 59:03.860
Glitz.

59:03.862 --> 59:06.028
"Glitz"?
Something sharp looking.

59:06.030 --> 59:08.930
You know, something with
a bit of pizzazz to it.

59:08.932 --> 59:10.698
- Hot.
- Oh.

59:10.700 --> 59:13.667
Well, if I need some... Glitz.

59:13.669 --> 59:17.070
...glitz, then I gotta go get some.
Where do you go to get it?

59:17.072 --> 59:19.639
At a franchised glitz dealer.
At a franchised glitz dealer.

59:19.641 --> 59:22.642
Well, wherever it is
you go, let's go.

59:49.667 --> 59:53.602
<i>Everybody all around the world.</i>

59:53.604 --> 59:57.706
<i>Gotta tell you</i>
<i>what I just heard.</i>

59:57.708 --> 01:00:02.010
<i>That there's gonna be a party</i>
<i>all over the world.</i>

01:00:04.848 --> 01:00:08.916
<i>I got a message on the radio.</i>

01:00:08.918 --> 01:00:12.019
<i>But where it came from</i>
<i>I don't really know.</i>

01:00:12.021 --> 01:00:15.022
<i>And I heard these</i>
<i>voices calling.</i>

01:00:15.024 --> 01:00:18.058
<i>All over the world.</i>

01:00:20.629 --> 01:00:23.663
<i>All over the world.</i>

01:00:24.565 --> 01:00:28.700
<i>Everybody got the word.</i>

01:00:28.702 --> 01:00:32.136
<i>Everybody, everywhere</i>
<i>is gonna feel it tonight.</i>

01:00:32.138 --> 01:00:33.804
<i>Tonight.</i>

01:00:40.178 --> 01:00:44.079
<i>Everybody walking</i>
<i>down the street.</i>

01:00:44.081 --> 01:00:46.748
<i>Everybody moving to the beat.</i>

01:00:48.184 --> 01:00:51.818
<i>They gonna get hot</i>
<i>down in the USA.</i>

01:00:51.820 --> 01:00:55.721
<i>New York, Detroit, LA.</i>

01:00:55.723 --> 01:00:59.858
<i>We gonna take a trip</i>
<i>across the sea.</i>

01:00:59.860 --> 01:01:03.561
<i>Everybody come along with me.</i>

01:01:03.563 --> 01:01:07.865
<i>We're gonna hit the nights</i>
<i>down in gay Paris.</i>

01:01:07.867 --> 01:01:11.568
<i>See the Duke</i>
<i>Then we'll pick up the team.</i>

01:01:11.570 --> 01:01:15.238
<i>All over the world.</i>

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.141
<i>Everybody got the word.</i>

01:01:19.143 --> 01:01:22.911
<i>Everybody, everywhere</i>
<i>is gonna feel it tonight.</i>

01:01:29.219 --> 01:01:31.252
<i>All over the world.</i>

01:01:38.225 --> 01:01:42.260
<i>London, Tampa, Hollywood.</i>

01:01:42.262 --> 01:01:46.030
<i>New York, Hong Kong, Tokyo.</i>

01:01:46.032 --> 01:01:49.900
<i>LA, New York, Amsterdam.</i>

01:01:49.902 --> 01:01:53.069
<i>Monte Carlo, China, and then.</i>

01:01:54.305 --> 01:01:58.273
<i>All over the world.</i>

01:01:58.275 --> 01:02:02.310
<i>Everybody got the word.</i>

01:02:02.312 --> 01:02:06.013
<i>Everybody, everywhere</i>
<i>is gonna feel it tonight.</i>

01:02:13.822 --> 01:02:17.924
<i>Everybody all around the world.</i>

01:02:17.926 --> 01:02:21.794
<i>Gotta tell you what</i>
<i>I just heard.</i>

01:02:21.796 --> 01:02:25.264
<i>Everybody walking</i>
<i>down the street.</i>

01:02:25.266 --> 01:02:29.334
<i>I know a place where</i>
<i>we all can meet.</i>

01:02:29.336 --> 01:02:33.304
<i>Everybody gonna have</i>
<i>a good time.</i>

01:02:33.306 --> 01:02:37.174
<i>Everybody will shine</i>
<i>till the daylight.</i>

01:02:37.176 --> 01:02:41.144
<i>All over the world.</i>

01:02:41.146 --> 01:02:45.248
<i>Everybody got the word.</i>

01:02:45.250 --> 01:02:49.251
<i>Everybody, everywhere</i>
<i>is gonna feel it tonight.</i>

01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:56.891
<i>All over the world.</i>

01:02:56.893 --> 01:03:00.794
<i>Everybody got the word.</i>

01:03:00.796 --> 01:03:04.497
<i>All over the world.</i>

01:03:04.499 --> 01:03:08.367
<i>Everybody got the word, word</i>
<i>Word, word, word, word, word.</i>

01:03:08.369 --> 01:03:12.137
<i>All over the world.</i>

01:03:12.139 --> 01:03:15.073
<i>Everybody got the word.</i>

01:03:21.514 --> 01:03:24.548
Yeah, that's right.
We're opening tomorrow night.

01:03:24.550 --> 01:03:27.450
Well, you can bring your
TV cameras if you like,

01:03:27.452 --> 01:03:30.319
but we're not gonna do
any of that celebrity stuff.

01:03:30.321 --> 01:03:32.454
No, no, just people.

01:03:33.223 --> 01:03:35.189
Anybody who shows up.

01:03:35.191 --> 01:03:38.992
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
So long.

01:03:38.994 --> 01:03:41.828
I wonder what would have happened
if I got that album to paint?

01:03:41.830 --> 01:03:44.797
Don't worry.
Your turn will come.

01:03:44.799 --> 01:03:47.833
Everyone gets at least one
chance at feeling like that.

01:03:47.835 --> 01:03:49.434
Yeah. That's what they say.

01:03:49.436 --> 01:03:51.402
That's what I say.

01:03:51.404 --> 01:03:54.471
All right, what's next, boss?

01:03:54.473 --> 01:03:57.907
Well, we're down to little
details. Fountains, yes.

01:03:57.909 --> 01:04:01.443
The mirrors, yes. Next, we
need those new parking signs.

01:04:01.445 --> 01:04:03.278
Oh, the signs are here. We
just haven't put them up yet.

01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:05.380
Well, come on. Give me a hand.
Let's get them up.

01:04:05.382 --> 01:04:07.415
I'll be right back. I wanna talk
to you about the sound system.

01:04:07.417 --> 01:04:09.450
Sure.

01:04:09.452 --> 01:04:11.885
You've made the place
look beautiful.

01:04:11.887 --> 01:04:13.453
Just did what the kid said.

01:04:13.455 --> 01:04:16.189
Oh, I see a little
Danny McGuire here and there.

01:04:16.191 --> 01:04:21.159
Oh, just here and there. Don't
tell anybody, but I'm nervous.

01:04:21.161 --> 01:04:23.194
What about?

01:04:23.196 --> 01:04:27.598
Well, I haven't had
an opening night since 1945.

01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:30.334
Wow! I guess I got the jitters.

01:04:30.336 --> 01:04:33.603
Well, just pretend we're
back in 1945 all over again.

01:04:33.605 --> 01:04:36.472
I don't have to pretend.

01:04:36.474 --> 01:04:39.474
It is 1945 all over again.

01:04:42.579 --> 01:04:44.579
Well, that takes care of that.

01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:46.547
Sonny, don't worry
about that sound system.

01:04:46.549 --> 01:04:49.283
I looked over it twice today
and it's fine.

01:04:49.285 --> 01:04:51.118
You kids go on home.

01:04:54.990 --> 01:04:58.057
Bye, Danny. 1945.

01:05:04.298 --> 01:05:07.599
You did it. Tomorrow's your big day.
It's all gonna come true.

01:05:07.601 --> 01:05:11.035
Tomorrow's gonna be the most
beautiful day in the world.

01:05:11.037 --> 01:05:12.269
Kira.

01:05:14.039 --> 01:05:15.304
I love you.

01:05:16.507 --> 01:05:18.206
I love you, Sonny.

01:05:25.014 --> 01:05:26.446
What's the matter?

01:05:26.448 --> 01:05:29.449
All of it, everything.

01:05:29.451 --> 01:05:32.185
We can't go on pretending
this is for real.

01:05:32.187 --> 01:05:34.387
I know, it is hard to believe.

01:05:34.389 --> 01:05:37.957
I can't have
these kind of feelings.

01:05:37.959 --> 01:05:40.092
It's beginning to hurt.

01:05:40.094 --> 01:05:42.894
This part of it was
never supposed to happen.

01:05:42.896 --> 01:05:44.362
I don't understand.

01:05:46.199 --> 01:05:48.666
What do you mean, "hurt"?

01:05:48.668 --> 01:05:51.502
I know I shouldn't,
but I do, and it's crazy.

01:05:53.405 --> 01:05:56.139
Sonny, there's something I
have to tell you about myself.

01:05:56.141 --> 01:05:57.440
I know all I need to know.

01:05:57.442 --> 01:05:59.683
No, I have to tell you.
I have no choice.

01:06:01.111 --> 01:06:03.344
All I was sent to do
was to make Xanadu happen.

01:06:03.346 --> 01:06:05.512
I don't get it.

01:06:05.514 --> 01:06:09.382
Sonny, you have to believe me when I tell
you that I never wanted to hurt you.

01:06:09.384 --> 01:06:12.351
That was the last thing
I wanted to happen.

01:06:13.921 --> 01:06:16.955
I'm not as I appear to you.

01:06:16.957 --> 01:06:19.490
Have you ever heard the
expression, "Kissed by a muse"?

01:06:19.492 --> 01:06:22.326
That's what I am. I'm a muse.

01:06:22.328 --> 01:06:24.094
I'm glad somebody's
having a good time.

01:06:24.096 --> 01:06:26.396
Please don't make a joke.
I'm serious.

01:06:27.599 --> 01:06:30.199
I come from Mount Helicon.

01:06:30.201 --> 01:06:34.569
I'm the daughter of Zeus. I have eight sisters.
My real name is...

01:06:37.574 --> 01:06:40.074
Are you telling me
that's not real?

01:06:40.076 --> 01:06:44.311
I'm trying to tell you the truth.
Why don't you believe me?

01:06:44.313 --> 01:06:46.646
Look up the word "muse"
in the dictionary. Go on.

01:06:46.648 --> 01:06:49.081
Page 728. Read it.

01:06:49.083 --> 01:06:51.282
Okay. All right, I'll read it.

01:06:54.253 --> 01:06:56.419
"Muse. Any of the
nine sister..."

01:06:56.421 --> 01:06:58.320
Like the album cover?

01:06:58.989 --> 01:07:01.322
Hmm.

01:07:01.324 --> 01:07:04.491
"Any of the nine sister
goddesses in Greek mythology

01:07:04.493 --> 01:07:08.261
"presiding over song and poetry
and the arts and sciences.

01:07:08.263 --> 01:07:10.363
"And do you believe me now,
Sonny?"

01:07:12.633 --> 01:07:15.333
How'd you do that?
What's going on?

01:07:15.335 --> 01:07:16.734
The television.

01:07:20.973 --> 01:07:24.341
<i>Well, well, look who's here.</i>

01:07:24.343 --> 01:07:28.345
<i>Who's chasing you this time, Vargas?
The cops? Or the mob?</i>

01:07:28.347 --> 01:07:31.047
<i>Don't get smart with me, Nick.</i>

01:07:31.049 --> 01:07:33.716
<i>I told you to stay away</i>
<i>from Brenda Trent.</i>

01:07:33.718 --> 01:07:38.654
<i>Yes, you did tell me.</i>
<i>What should I do, Sonny?</i>

01:07:38.656 --> 01:07:41.123
<i>Dive at him or make a martini?</i>

01:07:41.125 --> 01:07:43.725
- What?
<i>- Who you talking to?</i>

01:07:43.727 --> 01:07:47.662
<i>Sonny Malone. He doesn't</i>
<i>believe Kira's a muse.</i>

01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:50.364
How can you be talking to me?
You're a movie.

01:07:50.366 --> 01:07:53.300
<i>I ain't got time</i>
<i>for this, Malone.</i>

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:56.603
<i>Brenda's the only one</i>
<i>that saw me at the racetrack.</i>

01:07:56.605 --> 01:08:00.707
<i>Now if the lady says</i>
<i>she's a muse, she's a muse.</i>

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:03.443
<i>Who's that? Brenda!</i>

01:08:03.745 --> 01:08:05.044
Kira.

01:08:05.513 --> 01:08:06.712
<i>Sonny.</i>

01:08:10.383 --> 01:08:12.349
<i>I think he needs a drink.</i>

01:08:12.351 --> 01:08:15.218
It's okay.
I'll take care of it. Thanks.

01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:18.319
<i>Good luck on the opening</i>
<i>of your joint, kid.</i>

01:08:20.290 --> 01:08:22.223
<i>Wish I could be there.</i>

01:08:26.629 --> 01:08:27.761
Oh, wow!

01:08:29.765 --> 01:08:31.363
Oh, Sonny.

01:08:32.367 --> 01:08:35.267
We've been painted
by Michelangelo.

01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:38.236
Shakespeare's written
sonnets about us.

01:08:38.238 --> 01:08:41.238
Beethoven's played
music for us.

01:08:41.241 --> 01:08:45.276
We're not supposed to feel
emotion or show any feelings.

01:08:45.278 --> 01:08:47.511
Muses are just supposed
to inspire.

01:08:50.782 --> 01:08:52.448
I fell in love.

01:08:53.384 --> 01:08:55.517
You did?

01:08:55.519 --> 01:08:58.553
Well, what do you think
happened to me?

01:08:58.555 --> 01:09:01.354
It was a mistake.
I broke the rules.

01:09:01.357 --> 01:09:03.689
Well, now what the hell
do we do, huh?

01:09:03.692 --> 01:09:05.258
Answer that, muse!

01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:06.559
I don't know.

01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:09.728
I'm sorry. It just never
should have happened.

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:12.063
Well, it did.

01:09:12.064 --> 01:09:13.397
I love you, Sonny.

01:09:18.136 --> 01:09:19.435
Kira.

01:09:21.138 --> 01:09:22.703
I'll love you forever.

01:09:24.207 --> 01:09:25.738
I will.

01:09:25.741 --> 01:09:27.506
I'll love you forever.

01:09:29.810 --> 01:09:31.577
Kira! Wait!

01:09:33.113 --> 01:09:35.113
<i>I'll love you forever.</i>

01:09:42.854 --> 01:09:46.622
Hey, painter! I've been looking for you.
Where you been?

01:09:46.625 --> 01:09:47.624
Here.

01:09:48.727 --> 01:09:50.460
Well, how do I look?

01:09:50.462 --> 01:09:53.595
Aren't you gonna say anything
about my new threads?

01:09:54.532 --> 01:09:55.864
Hubba, hubba.

01:09:57.534 --> 01:10:01.269
Well, we're gonna
miss you tonight.

01:10:01.271 --> 01:10:03.204
It won't be any fun
without you.

01:10:03.206 --> 01:10:05.339
I told you. I can't go.

01:10:06.208 --> 01:10:08.708
Xanadu doesn't matter anymore.

01:10:08.710 --> 01:10:12.445
What do you mean, it doesn't matter?
How can it not matter?

01:10:12.447 --> 01:10:15.547
This was our dream.
Well, wasn't it?

01:10:17.551 --> 01:10:20.585
There's no Xanadu
'cause there's no Kira.

01:10:22.121 --> 01:10:24.354
She made it real.

01:10:24.356 --> 01:10:26.622
So find her! Bring her back!

01:10:27.858 --> 01:10:29.457
Dreams die.

01:10:29.459 --> 01:10:30.758
No.

01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:34.762
No, no, no. Not by themselves.
We kill them.

01:10:34.764 --> 01:10:37.731
Now, if you give up,
you'll be sitting on that rock

01:10:37.733 --> 01:10:40.734
30 years from now,
just like I was.

01:10:40.736 --> 01:10:45.305
I know how you feel, kid. I
felt the same way once. I did.

01:10:45.307 --> 01:10:47.707
I didn't know
how important love is.

01:10:48.443 --> 01:10:50.709
But let me tell you something.

01:10:50.711 --> 01:10:54.846
Somehow, somewhere,
there's a way to get her!

01:10:54.848 --> 01:10:57.682
If she got here,
there's a way to get there.

01:10:57.684 --> 01:11:00.417
Believe me, kid,
it's up to you.

01:11:02.687 --> 01:11:04.286
It's up to you.

01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:30.542
<i>I see the early glow.</i>

01:11:30.544 --> 01:11:33.545
<i>I hear you say hello.</i>

01:11:34.681 --> 01:11:38.816
<i>I watch the shadows fall.</i>

01:11:38.818 --> 01:11:41.385
<i>I don't see you at all.</i>

01:11:41.387 --> 01:11:45.389
<i>It's a lie</i>
<i>I don't believe it's so.</i>

01:11:45.391 --> 01:11:49.459
<i>It's a lie.</i>

01:11:49.461 --> 01:11:53.563
<i>I see the autumn rain.</i>

01:11:53.565 --> 01:11:57.600
<i>Falling on my window pane.</i>

01:11:57.602 --> 01:12:00.903
<i>I hear you say goodbye.</i>

01:12:01.705 --> 01:12:04.072
<i>I see a tear in your eye.</i>

01:12:04.074 --> 01:12:08.342
<i>It's a lie</i>
<i>I don't believe it's so.</i>

01:12:08.344 --> 01:12:12.579
<i>It's a lie.</i>

01:12:12.581 --> 01:12:16.049
<i>Our love couldn't go wrong.</i>

01:12:16.051 --> 01:12:18.084
<i>How could I know.</i>

01:12:18.086 --> 01:12:20.953
<i>I was only dreaming.</i>

01:12:20.955 --> 01:12:22.487
<i>And now.</i>

01:12:22.489 --> 01:12:24.555
<i>Now that you're gone.</i>

01:12:24.557 --> 01:12:29.059
<i>I will go on really believing.</i>

01:12:30.829 --> 01:12:32.728
<i>I take the fall.</i>

01:12:47.443 --> 01:12:49.843
<i>I take the fall.</i>

01:12:51.613 --> 01:12:55.715
<i>I see you in a dream.</i>

01:12:55.717 --> 01:12:58.684
<i>You turn and start to go.</i>

01:12:59.887 --> 01:13:03.054
<i>I call to you once more.</i>

01:13:04.023 --> 01:13:06.590
<i>Guess that I'm taking the fall.</i>

01:13:06.592 --> 01:13:10.560
<i>It's a lie</i>
<i>I don't believe it's so.</i>

01:13:10.562 --> 01:13:12.962
<i>It's a lie.</i>

01:13:14.899 --> 01:13:18.567
<i>Our love couldn't go wrong.</i>

01:13:18.569 --> 01:13:20.368
<i>How could I know.</i>

01:13:20.370 --> 01:13:23.070
<i>I was only dreaming.</i>

01:13:23.072 --> 01:13:24.838
<i>And now.</i>

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.906
<i>Now that you're gone.</i>

01:13:26.908 --> 01:13:31.577
<i>I will go on really believing.</i>

01:13:35.416 --> 01:13:37.716
<i>I take the fall.</i>

01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:28.799
Kira.

01:14:28.801 --> 01:14:31.835
Sonny. How did you get here?

01:14:31.837 --> 01:14:34.137
You didn't think I'd let you
get away from me, did you?

01:14:34.139 --> 01:14:35.638
You'll have to go back.

01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:37.740
Okay, I'm ready. Let's go.

01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:45.012
I can't go with you, but you have
to get out before it's too late.

01:14:45.014 --> 01:14:46.913
Too late for what?

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:50.716
Oh, please, you took
a big chance coming here.

01:14:50.718 --> 01:14:54.152
What's going on here? I'm
taking you back with me, Kira.

01:14:54.154 --> 01:14:57.688
It can't be done. Nobody's
ever taken anyone out of here.

01:14:57.690 --> 01:15:00.090
Not in the whole history of...
The whole history.

01:15:00.092 --> 01:15:02.025
I'll make them let you go.

01:15:03.094 --> 01:15:04.693
Hey, Zeus!

01:15:04.695 --> 01:15:07.595
Zeus, you hear me? Oh, God.

01:15:07.597 --> 01:15:09.964
I wanna talk to you.

01:15:09.966 --> 01:15:14.201
<i>We don't use those</i>
<i>old-fashioned names anymore.</i>

01:15:14.203 --> 01:15:17.938
<i>In any case, it's me</i>
<i>you want to speak to.</i>

01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:19.923
I've come to get Kira.

01:15:19.924 --> 01:15:21.907
<i>She's not leaving!</i>
<i>It's impossible!</i>

01:15:23.544 --> 01:15:27.145
That's what you think.
<i>That's what you think.</i>

01:15:27.147 --> 01:15:28.713
How'd you know
I was gonna say that?

01:15:28.715 --> 01:15:31.082
<i>Put it this way.</i>
<i>I'm a good guesser.</i>

01:15:32.151 --> 01:15:33.483
What else do you know?

01:15:33.485 --> 01:15:34.817
<i>Everything.</i>

01:15:34.819 --> 01:15:37.085
All right, then. You know this.

01:15:37.087 --> 01:15:39.854
I'm sticking to this place
till hell freezes over.

01:15:39.856 --> 01:15:42.407
Sonny!

01:15:42.408 --> 01:15:44.959
<i>You'll leave now</i>
<i>and you'll leave without Kira!</i>

01:15:44.961 --> 01:15:48.662
Why? <i> Because other
people have dreams.</i>

01:15:48.664 --> 01:15:50.096
So send another muse.

01:15:50.098 --> 01:15:52.698
You got muses running
around all over the place.

01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:56.134
<i>One dream, one muse.</i>

01:15:56.136 --> 01:15:58.870
Wait... Wait a minute.
Just listen to me, okay?

01:16:01.674 --> 01:16:04.608
Kira and I love each other.

01:16:04.610 --> 01:16:07.143
Now I don't know how often that
happens in this kind of place,

01:16:07.145 --> 01:16:09.778
but back on Earth,
it's pretty rare.

01:16:12.649 --> 01:16:13.914
We need to be together.

01:16:13.916 --> 01:16:16.483
<i>All right, that's enough.</i>

01:16:16.484 --> 01:16:19.051
<i>You're leaving. Kira's staying.
No more discussions.</i>

01:16:19.054 --> 01:16:22.221
<i>Those are the rules</i>
<i>and that's all there is to it.</i>

01:16:22.223 --> 01:16:25.524
<i>On the other hand, dear, rules
were made to be broken.</i>

01:16:25.526 --> 01:16:27.025
<i>We'll talk about that later.</i>

01:16:27.027 --> 01:16:29.927
<i>Which is later</i>
<i>and which is earlier?</i>

01:16:29.929 --> 01:16:32.963
<i>- I keep forgetting.</i>
- Just a minute!

01:16:32.965 --> 01:16:35.565
Isn't anyone interested
in my feelings?

01:16:35.567 --> 01:16:37.600
<i>What do you mean, "feelings"?</i>

01:16:37.602 --> 01:16:40.069
<i>Oh, you remember, pet.</i>

01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:42.537
<i>We learnt about feelings</i>
<i>in our mortal history class.</i>

01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:43.872
Yes, feelings.

01:16:45.275 --> 01:16:48.209
I guess that's what
you call them.

01:16:48.211 --> 01:16:51.011
I've never really
had them before.

01:16:51.013 --> 01:16:54.013
I've never felt this way
about anyone before.

01:16:57.051 --> 01:16:58.884
And I've never asked
to leave here. Not ever.

01:16:58.886 --> 01:17:02.020
Not once in the whole
time I've been here.

01:17:02.021 --> 01:17:05.155
<i>No, it's true, dear, she hasn't.
Not in all these centuries.</i>

01:17:05.158 --> 01:17:08.826
<i>Or is it minutes?</i>
<i>I do keep mixing them up.</i>

01:17:08.828 --> 01:17:13.597
Please, can't we just have this one night?
Just one night?

01:17:13.599 --> 01:17:17.567
<i>No, no, it's just not possible.
Goodbye, Sonny Malone.</i>

01:17:17.569 --> 01:17:19.001
Hey, Kira?

01:17:19.837 --> 01:17:21.903
Just one moment?

01:17:21.905 --> 01:17:23.771
<i>Goodbye, Sonny.</i>

01:17:24.073 --> 01:17:25.806
Kira!

01:17:36.584 --> 01:17:41.353
<i>A child and a fool in one.</i>

01:17:41.355 --> 01:17:46.291
<i>So sure I could need no one.</i>

01:17:46.293 --> 01:17:52.630
<i>My heart always on the run</i>
<i>to nowhere.</i>

01:17:56.068 --> 01:18:01.037
<i>Now as you're holding me.</i>

01:18:01.039 --> 01:18:05.974
<i>My heart is reminding me.</i>

01:18:05.976 --> 01:18:10.378
<i>That now I could never be.</i>

01:18:10.380 --> 01:18:12.779
<i>Without you.</i>

01:18:15.717 --> 01:18:20.618
<i>But how can our love succeed?</i>

01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:25.322
<i>A miracle is what we need.</i>

01:18:25.324 --> 01:18:29.625
<i>And so I appeal to you.</i>

01:18:32.830 --> 01:18:37.865
<i>To keep me suspended</i>
<i>in time with you.</i>

01:18:37.867 --> 01:18:41.301
<i>Don't let this moment die.</i>

01:18:42.904 --> 01:18:47.673
<i>I get a feeling</i>
<i>when I'm with you.</i>

01:18:47.675 --> 01:18:52.310
<i>None of the rules apply.</i>

01:18:52.312 --> 01:18:57.281
<i>But I know for certain</i>
<i>Goodbye is a crime.</i>

01:18:57.283 --> 01:19:03.687
<i>So, love, if you need me</i>
<i>Suspend me in time.</i>

01:19:19.837 --> 01:19:25.173
<i>Wasted the time away.</i>

01:19:25.175 --> 01:19:29.910
<i>Holding our love at bay.</i>

01:19:29.912 --> 01:19:34.147
<i>Now I can't last a day.</i>

01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:36.115
<i>Without you.</i>

01:19:38.986 --> 01:19:44.221
<i>Your smile is a thrill to see.</i>

01:19:44.223 --> 01:19:49.459
<i>Your eyes hold me tenderly.</i>

01:19:49.461 --> 01:19:55.431
<i>They'll shine in my memory</i>
<i>forever.</i>

01:19:58.869 --> 01:20:03.737
<i>But how can our love succeed.</i>

01:20:03.739 --> 01:20:08.708
<i>A miracle is what we need.</i>

01:20:08.710 --> 01:20:13.011
<i>And so I appeal to you.</i>

01:20:15.949 --> 01:20:21.017
<i>To keep me suspended</i>
<i>in time with you.</i>

01:20:21.019 --> 01:20:24.419
<i>Don't let this moment die.</i>

01:20:26.122 --> 01:20:30.958
<i>I get a feeling</i>
<i>when I'm with you.</i>

01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:35.829
<i>None of the rules apply.</i>

01:20:35.831 --> 01:20:40.500
<i>But I know for certain</i>
<i>Goodbye is a crime.</i>

01:20:40.502 --> 01:20:47.139
<i>So, love, if you need me</i>
<i>Suspend me in time.</i>

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:53.624
<i>In time.</i>

01:21:10.897 --> 01:21:14.465
<i>Maybe just one moment, darling.</i>

01:21:14.467 --> 01:21:20.237
<i>Well, maybe just</i>
<i>one moment, or forever.</i>

01:21:20.239 --> 01:21:22.539
<i>I keep getting them</i>
<i>mixed up, too.</i>

01:21:37.287 --> 01:21:40.254
All right, everybody,
let's skate!

01:21:40.256 --> 01:21:41.922
Let's skate!

01:21:42.491 --> 01:21:45.057
Everybody! Come on!

01:21:50.663 --> 01:21:52.095
Go!

01:22:01.973 --> 01:22:03.472
I don't know yet.

01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:21.489
Up!

01:22:23.993 --> 01:22:25.359
Hey!

01:22:54.590 --> 01:22:56.222
Xanadu!

01:22:58.492 --> 01:22:59.724
Xanadu!

01:23:02.228 --> 01:23:03.527
Xanadu!

01:23:06.031 --> 01:23:07.296
Xanadu!

01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:11.232
Xanadu!

01:23:13.536 --> 01:23:14.635
Xanadu!

01:23:44.199 --> 01:23:45.398
Ho!

01:23:47.769 --> 01:23:49.068
Ho!

01:23:51.505 --> 01:23:52.737
Ho!

01:23:55.508 --> 01:23:56.473
Ho!

01:23:59.277 --> 01:24:00.476
Ho!

01:24:03.047 --> 01:24:04.212
Ho!

01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:07.782
Ho!

01:24:10.553 --> 01:24:11.652
Ho!

01:24:15.658 --> 01:24:17.124
Xanadu!

01:24:19.595 --> 01:24:20.794
Xanadu!

01:24:23.365 --> 01:24:24.430
Xanadu!

01:24:27.134 --> 01:24:28.399
Xanadu!

01:24:30.669 --> 01:24:32.201
Xanadu!

01:24:34.672 --> 01:24:35.804
Xanadu!

01:24:43.113 --> 01:24:44.312
Ho!

01:24:46.683 --> 01:24:47.815
Ho!

01:24:50.619 --> 01:24:52.118
Ho!

01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:54.253
<i>A place.</i>

01:24:54.255 --> 01:24:58.223
<i>Where nobody dared to go.</i>

01:24:58.225 --> 01:25:01.092
<i>The love that we came to know.</i>

01:25:01.094 --> 01:25:04.328
<i>They call it Xanadu.</i>

01:25:04.330 --> 01:25:07.230
<i>It takes your breath</i>
<i>and it'll leave you blind.</i>

01:25:07.232 --> 01:25:09.565
<i>And now.</i>

01:25:09.567 --> 01:25:13.201
<i>Open your eyes and see.</i>

01:25:13.203 --> 01:25:16.170
<i>What we have made is real.</i>

01:25:16.172 --> 01:25:19.273
<i>We are in Xanadu.</i>

01:25:19.275 --> 01:25:21.708
<i>A dream of it, we offer you.</i>

01:25:23.478 --> 01:25:26.278
<i>A million lights are dancing.</i>

01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:31.215
<i>And there you are</i>
<i>A shooting star.</i>

01:25:31.217 --> 01:25:33.450
<i>An everlasting world.</i>

01:25:33.452 --> 01:25:37.787
<i>And you're here with me</i>
<i>eternally.</i>

01:25:39.657 --> 01:25:42.190
<i>Xanadu.</i>

01:25:43.593 --> 01:25:46.627
<i>Xanadu.</i>

01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:49.262
<i>Now we are here In Xanadu.</i>

01:25:49.264 --> 01:25:51.197
<i>Xanadu.</i>

01:25:54.735 --> 01:25:56.801
<i>Xanadu.</i>

01:25:58.704 --> 01:26:01.538
<i>Xanadu.</i>

01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:06.476
<i>Now we are here In Xanadu.</i>

01:26:06.478 --> 01:26:11.480
<i>Xanadu</i>
<i>Your neon lights will shine.</i>

01:26:11.482 --> 01:26:15.317
<i>For you, Xanadu.</i>

01:26:17.154 --> 01:26:19.287
<i>The love.</i>

01:26:19.289 --> 01:26:23.224
<i>The echoes of long ago.</i>

01:26:23.226 --> 01:26:26.160
<i>You needed the world to know.</i>

01:26:26.162 --> 01:26:29.396
<i>They are in Xanadu.</i>

01:26:29.398 --> 01:26:32.265
<i>With every breath</i>
<i>you drift away.</i>

01:26:32.267 --> 01:26:34.600
<i>The dream.</i>

01:26:34.602 --> 01:26:38.136
<i>That came through</i>
<i>a million years.</i>

01:26:38.138 --> 01:26:41.205
<i>That lived on through</i>
<i>all the tears.</i>

01:26:41.207 --> 01:26:44.208
<i>It came to Xanadu.</i>

01:26:44.210 --> 01:26:48.579
<i>The dream you dream</i>
<i>Well, it will happen to you.</i>

01:26:48.581 --> 01:26:51.448
<i>A million lights are dancing.</i>

01:26:51.450 --> 01:26:56.151
<i>And there you are</i>
<i>A shooting star.</i>

01:26:56.153 --> 01:26:58.553
<i>An everlasting love.</i>

01:26:58.555 --> 01:27:03.190
<i>And you're here with me</i>
<i>eternally.</i>

01:27:04.860 --> 01:27:06.726
<i>Xanadu.</i>

01:27:08.563 --> 01:27:11.463
<i>Xanadu.</i>

01:27:11.465 --> 01:27:14.332
<i>Now we are here In Xanadu.</i>

01:27:14.334 --> 01:27:16.333
<i>Xanadu.</i>

01:27:19.738 --> 01:27:21.804
<i>Xanadu.</i>

01:27:23.774 --> 01:27:26.574
<i>Xanadu.</i>

01:27:26.576 --> 01:27:30.210
<i>Now we are here In Xanadu.</i>

01:27:30.212 --> 01:27:31.811
<i>Xanadu, Xanadu.</i>

01:27:31.813 --> 01:27:36.581
<i>Now that I'm here</i>
<i>Now that you're near.</i>

01:27:36.583 --> 01:27:39.517
<i>In Xanadu.</i>

01:27:39.519 --> 01:27:43.854
<i>Now that I'm here</i>
<i>Now that you're near.</i>

01:27:43.856 --> 01:27:44.536
<i>In Xanadu.</i>

01:28:54.392 --> 01:28:55.758
Way to go!

01:28:59.796 --> 01:29:01.529
<i>Fool.</i>

01:29:01.531 --> 01:29:04.298
<i>Whatever you do</i>
<i>you're reminded.</i>

01:29:05.701 --> 01:29:07.500
<i>Fool.</i>

01:29:07.502 --> 01:29:11.537
<i>Wherever you go</i>
<i>you won't find it.</i>

01:29:11.539 --> 01:29:14.873
<i>I'm really down on love</i>
<i>So save all your smiles.</i>

01:29:14.875 --> 01:29:17.475
<i>Ooh, I won't be needing</i>
<i>any love for a while.</i>

01:29:17.477 --> 01:29:20.744
<i>I'm really down on love</i>
<i>So save all your smiles.</i>

01:29:20.746 --> 01:29:22.979
<i>Ooh, I won't be needing</i>
<i>any love for a while.</i>

01:29:22.981 --> 01:29:25.948
<i>Fool, fool, fool.</i>

01:29:25.950 --> 01:29:28.617
<i>Fool, fool, fool.</i>

01:29:30.787 --> 01:29:35.322
