WEBVTT

00:06.800 --> 00:08.880
Ex on the Beach is back.

00:10.800 --> 00:13.320
This time they are balling in Bali.

00:14.360 --> 00:15.960
Party!

00:17.520 --> 00:20.200
Eight sexy singles
looking for love...

00:21.680 --> 00:24.800
He's the only person
that I've ever loved.

00:24.880 --> 00:27.800
I love this girl.
I'm gonna fucking be with her.

00:27.880 --> 00:32.759
...by getting over the ghosts of
their pasts on the beach of doom.

00:35.920 --> 00:36.960
Fuck's sake.

00:37.040 --> 00:38.960
(shout over each other)
I said that?

00:39.040 --> 00:41.240
He gets with anyone,
I'll go fucking mad.

00:41.320 --> 00:44.680
There'll be tantrums...
I am fucking fuming!

00:46.320 --> 00:48.960
You shagged my good mate
behind my back!

00:49.040 --> 00:50.400
...trauma...

00:50.480 --> 00:52.760
(shouting)
Come on, then.

00:52.840 --> 00:54.360
...and, as always,

00:54.440 --> 00:58.960
the Tablet of Terror is on hand
to cause misery...

00:59.040 --> 01:02.040
I'm sick of being like this
every single time.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.080
...and mischief.
Guys.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.160
Love hurts.

01:06.240 --> 01:09.680
And it hurts like hell.
Five exes have arrived.

01:12.080 --> 01:14.200
Coo-coo! (laughs)

01:15.720 --> 01:18.120
Bring it on, pencil dick.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.400
I fucking love it!

01:22.000 --> 01:28.074

01:44.680 --> 01:48.840
Me and Dean got back from our date
and we went up to the penthouse.

01:48.920 --> 01:50.800
It was more short than sweet.

01:50.880 --> 01:54.560
Had a little drink, a little chat,
had a little shag.

01:55.920 --> 01:58.040
I'm not really vibing Dean
this morning.

01:58.120 --> 02:00.120
Probably have to vibe myself
later on.

02:01.400 --> 02:03.240
Che and Dean's having a lie-in.

02:03.320 --> 02:06.000
Probably fucking sucking him off,
the tramp.

02:06.080 --> 02:09.000
After last night,
she's a two-faced bitch.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.199
Oi!

02:11.240 --> 02:13.200
Are you fucking coming down or not?

02:14.320 --> 02:16.200
Pull your finger out her arse.

02:16.280 --> 02:19.080
Looks like I'm in trouble again.
Here he is.

02:22.200 --> 02:25.200
(laughter, jeering)
A minute?

02:25.280 --> 02:28.240
Do you not think
you didn't need to walk in cocky?

02:28.320 --> 02:30.760
Why have you got
such a bee in your bonnet?

02:30.840 --> 02:33.600
I didn't think living with Dean
was gonna be as hard.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.680
Fucking sending me over the edge.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.680
Things went really well with Marty.

02:38.760 --> 02:41.680
We didn't argue.
I feel like I'm in a good place.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.720
I don't think Marty understands
how much I love him.

02:44.800 --> 02:48.160
When me and him argue,
it really drains us and affects us.

02:48.240 --> 02:50.320
So I'm so glad
me and him are friends.

02:50.400 --> 02:53.360
Everything is class with Chloe now,
we're getting on.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.640
But I've been having
a few secret kisses.

02:55.720 --> 02:57.920
I'm starting to get a bit bored.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.200
I want to kiss down the pool,
but I can't

03:00.280 --> 03:02.360
cos she's shit-scared of Chloe.

03:02.440 --> 03:04.080
I might try and finger her.

03:04.160 --> 03:07.040
Ugh, Marty!
Let your breakfast go down first.

03:14.520 --> 03:17.520
We've cooled things off now.
The girl is mental.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.880
The girl is absolutely crackers.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.160
But if she wants a shag,
I'll shag her.

03:22.240 --> 03:25.040
He says he just wants to be friends.
I know it's a game.

03:25.120 --> 03:26.720
I know he likes me.

03:26.800 --> 03:30.480
I just hope a fit lad comes out
the water to make Max jealous.

03:30.560 --> 03:33.720
And Max won't be the only one
to get jealous

03:33.800 --> 03:37.120
when more exes come rampaging
onto the beach.

03:37.200 --> 03:39.520
Whose ex is next?

03:43.880 --> 03:44.960
(beeps)

03:45.040 --> 03:47.200
(all) Oh!
(laughter)

03:47.280 --> 03:49.160
Tablet of Terror, fuck off.

03:49.240 --> 03:52.040
"Things are getting pretty relaxed
in the villa."

03:52.120 --> 03:55.320
"It's time to ramp up the tension.
Georgia, Jordan and Chloe

03:55.400 --> 03:57.720
are off to the beach
to meet the new arrival."

03:57.800 --> 03:59.160
(all) Oh!

03:59.240 --> 04:02.880
In the past, the Tablet of Terror
has dug me out. It's doing the same.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.200
Oh, my God, I feel physically sick!

04:05.280 --> 04:06.800
I hope it's not my ex.

04:06.880 --> 04:10.240
Marty and my ex don't like
each other. They hate each other.

04:10.320 --> 04:12.000
Who's your ex?
He's called Sam.

04:12.080 --> 04:13.880
I really wanna get back with him,

04:13.960 --> 04:16.360
but I'm really nervous
how Marty will react.

04:16.440 --> 04:20.640
Marty's not seen us with someone
I like before, so it'll be a shock.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.920
My ex was marriage material
and he's such a good lad,

04:24.000 --> 04:25.760
but we just fell out of love.

04:25.840 --> 04:29.120
When me and John broke up,
I started seeing someone new.

04:29.200 --> 04:32.280
That hurt him. If he sees me
with a lad, he'll go crazy.

04:36.120 --> 04:39.680
If one of my naughty exes comes,
it could end up in tears.

04:39.760 --> 04:41.760
(yells)

04:41.840 --> 04:43.840
(yells)

04:44.920 --> 04:47.640
With Chloe out of the way,
the Tablet of Terror

04:47.720 --> 04:52.320
sent Marty on a date with Savannah to
see if he can ride more than waves.

04:52.400 --> 04:55.160
I see this little lad
with a funny fucking haircut.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.960
You two have got matching hair.
Hair's good, huh?

04:58.040 --> 05:01.040
His hair's pure shit.
Am I gonna ruin my eyelashes?

05:02.040 --> 05:03.320
Er, I-I don't know.

05:03.400 --> 05:06.760
It's so nice to get out of the
villa with Marty, do what we want

05:06.840 --> 05:08.760
and not worry about anyone seeing.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.600
Can we ride some waves or what?

05:13.440 --> 05:16.200
I love surfing.
Everything's so calm.

05:16.280 --> 05:19.720
Then I see a beasty wave,
"Yeah, I'm gonna ride this."

05:19.800 --> 05:22.480
Just like I'm gonna
ride Savannah up the bum.

05:22.560 --> 05:25.000
Marty is actually
really good at surfing.

05:25.080 --> 05:27.520
Like, I'm in shock,
it's very impressive.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.760
All Savannah was doing
was lying there.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.800
Hope that's not what
she'll do later.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.040
Here.
So bad, isn't it?

05:39.640 --> 05:41.880
How do you feel about danger kisses?

05:41.960 --> 05:44.240
I feel like,
am I being fucking sneaky

05:44.320 --> 05:46.040
by, like, not saying owt to her?

05:46.120 --> 05:48.440
I'm starting
to feel really bad for Chloe.

05:48.520 --> 05:50.240
I know deep down she is bothered.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.840
I think that
she does still actually like you.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.920
I think it'll be really hard
for her.

05:55.000 --> 05:56.840
Savannah is worried about Chloe.

05:56.920 --> 05:59.680
If Chloe's ex-lad comes in,
everything'll be cut.

05:59.760 --> 06:02.440
It's really hard for her
at the moment,

06:02.520 --> 06:04.920
to see you with any other girls.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.800
But I do think it's a case of...

06:09.880 --> 06:12.640
...what she doesn't know
can't hurt her.

06:12.720 --> 06:15.000
(laughs) Yes!

06:15.080 --> 06:16.640
Why don't we bang as well?

06:16.720 --> 06:18.360
I'm fucking mint, me.

06:21.160 --> 06:25.120
Me and Marty both agreed we won't
tell anyone about any secret kisses.

06:25.200 --> 06:28.280
That means no-one can get hurt.
We need a secret bang.

06:28.360 --> 06:30.680
Tonight, I'm gonna go in
for a secret shag,

06:30.760 --> 06:32.600
cos I am getting horny.

06:32.680 --> 06:34.120
(laughs)

06:38.640 --> 06:41.080
Do you think Max will be jealous
about your ex?

06:41.160 --> 06:43.320
If he was jealous,
it'd be nice to see.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.960
I've had a hard time with Max,

06:45.040 --> 06:47.560
but if my ex comes in,
it will change everything.

06:47.640 --> 06:49.080
Where is my ex?

06:49.160 --> 06:52.600
My ex Sydney is a bit fiery.
She could really stir things up.

06:52.680 --> 06:55.480
If your ex Sam comes in,
how would Marty be with him?

06:55.560 --> 06:59.240
I would spend more time with him,
so Marty would feel, like, ugh.

06:59.320 --> 07:01.880
My head's like a yo-yo,
all over the place.

07:02.880 --> 07:04.120
This is bad.

07:04.200 --> 07:07.120
It will change everything.
Really stir things up.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.600
(gasps)

07:23.680 --> 07:25.480
Oh, my God, it's my ex Sam!

07:26.880 --> 07:28.840
Thank fuck it's not my ex.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.400
Hello.You all right?
I'm so happy to see you.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.440
Are you?
God, yes.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.560
I'm Sam, from Northampton.

07:36.640 --> 07:39.800
I'm a part-time DJ
but full-time party boy.

07:39.880 --> 07:42.720
I've co-run the biggest night club
in Northampton.

07:44.360 --> 07:47.560
You can either find me in
the DJ booth or, most likely,

07:47.640 --> 07:48.960
in the VIP booth.

07:50.120 --> 07:53.360
Bottle service, Ciroc.
If it's good enough for Puff Daddy,

07:53.440 --> 07:54.720
it's good enough for me.

07:57.120 --> 07:58.840
For me and Chlo it was hard.

07:58.920 --> 08:02.680
There was no trust,
fights all the time, arguments.

08:02.760 --> 08:04.280
It was just... drama.

08:06.520 --> 08:10.120
People like Marty don't intimidate
me. I don't fucking like him.

08:10.200 --> 08:15.200
I think he's a dickhead.
He's mugged her off for years now.

08:15.280 --> 08:18.200
If he tries to come at me,
then he's gonna know.

08:20.320 --> 08:23.160
We've actually never
actually physically

08:23.240 --> 08:28.200
had a... exchange of words,
but if looks could kill... yeah.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.920
I'm so happy you're here.
What's been going on?

08:31.000 --> 08:33.159
Are you over Martin?
What's going on?

08:33.240 --> 08:36.360
With Chloe you get a lot of baggage,
including her ex, Marty.

08:36.440 --> 08:38.159
I do still have feelings for her,

08:38.240 --> 08:41.440
but how am I meant to trust her,
when she's always with her ex?

08:41.520 --> 08:42.760
Oh, God!

08:42.840 --> 08:45.760
I need to talk to Sam and tell him
about me kissing Marty.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.680
I have something to tell you
which I really regret.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.080
The first night I did kiss Marty.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.920
She kissed Martin. What the fuck?

09:01.000 --> 09:02.920
Why do I wanna commit to someone

09:03.000 --> 09:05.320
that's constantly going back
to their ex?

09:05.400 --> 09:07.480
But I'm not going back.
You are.

09:07.560 --> 09:10.200
The first night, I was drunk.
You didn't need to.

09:12.080 --> 09:15.600
You constantly say you're over him
but only cos I'm in the villa.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.080
I don't want to be with Marty.

09:18.160 --> 09:20.520
She is still in love with Marty.

09:20.600 --> 09:23.800
You need to prove to them
why they wanna commit to you.

09:23.880 --> 09:25.760
I will now!
Give her a chance.

09:25.840 --> 09:28.920
I do feel for her. Cos I know
she's got feelings for him.

09:31.040 --> 09:33.800
Deep down,
I do want to give Chloe a chance.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.880
But I know that
she is not over Marty.

09:35.960 --> 09:39.520
It's time to fucking move on, get in
that villa, see what going on.

09:40.680 --> 09:43.080
(tablet dings)
(laughs)

09:44.240 --> 09:47.440
"Welcome, Sam. It's time for you
and Georgia to go on a date

09:47.520 --> 09:49.280
and get fruity with each other."

09:49.360 --> 09:51.520
I fucked off the girl code
with the bitch,

09:51.600 --> 09:54.080
but with Chloe, I respect you,
you respect me.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.600
I'm going on a date with Georgia.
Girl code, who gives a fuck?

09:57.680 --> 10:00.120
I'm still gonna try.
Have you seen the rack?

10:01.160 --> 10:02.680
Sam is not my type at all.

10:02.760 --> 10:05.360
He's skinny,
and he's like a camp Marty.

10:05.440 --> 10:06.640
I trust you, Georgia,

10:06.720 --> 10:09.920
and I know that, Sam,
you are not like that with girls.

10:13.400 --> 10:14.680
Enjoy.

10:16.760 --> 10:18.400
(groans)

10:18.480 --> 10:21.640
Hold this. I'm going back
to Newcastle now on this.

10:21.720 --> 10:24.720
Fuck this,
I'm getting the fuck out of here.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.200
To me, to you, to me, to you.
(laughs)

10:34.040 --> 10:36.000
This deck chair's shit!

10:44.520 --> 10:45.800
Hi.

10:45.880 --> 10:47.840
Hey. This is nice.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.840
Me and Georgia have walked in.
Fucking fruit carving.

10:50.920 --> 10:52.800
This is not romantic.

10:52.880 --> 10:55.080
I don't know how I'll crack on
but I'll try.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.520
Oh, Sam, you old smoothie!

10:57.600 --> 11:01.000
What are you gonna put on it?
I love...

11:01.080 --> 11:02.600
Cock?
No.

11:02.680 --> 11:04.000
Not a great start.

11:04.080 --> 11:07.200
Even if I didn't have a girl code
with Chloe,

11:07.280 --> 11:10.120
I don't think Sam is attractive.
What do you do?

11:10.200 --> 11:12.640
I'm a DJ/promoter.

11:12.720 --> 11:17.520
All I do is party 24/7,
three or four times a week.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.840
Why are you here?
I'm here to have a good time.

11:21.920 --> 11:23.520
Good.
I can do what I want.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.600
And so can she.

11:24.680 --> 11:28.680
I'm sure there'll be a girl
that doesn't know about girl code.

11:28.760 --> 11:30.440
What type are you looking for?

11:30.520 --> 11:34.440
I do like girls that have had
a bit of work. I like the fake look.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.080
Bit like you really.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.440
Wow!

11:37.520 --> 11:39.240
I'm not that fake.

11:39.320 --> 11:42.200
Lips aren't normal.So?
And your boobs ain't natural.

11:42.280 --> 11:44.360
That's it.
Two things I spotted.

11:45.360 --> 11:46.480
I'm not for him.

11:46.560 --> 11:49.200
This is going wonderfully(!)

11:49.280 --> 11:52.400
So your intentions are...?
I'm gonna have fun.

11:52.480 --> 11:55.240
Chloe's not gonna like that.
Chloe's a psychopath.

11:55.320 --> 11:59.480
I know all girls are psycho...
Yeah. All the best ones are.

11:59.560 --> 12:01.480
The Martin thing, it's proved to me

12:01.560 --> 12:04.000
I've gotta be there
for her to behave.

12:04.080 --> 12:08.440
I feel so sorry for Chloe, cos she
wants him, and he doesn't want her.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.640
She slept with Martin.
Slept with him?

12:10.720 --> 12:12.600
We weren't official, but she did.

12:12.680 --> 12:15.760
You need to show somebody
you can trust them. She hasn't.

12:15.840 --> 12:19.280
When I get back to the villa,
me and Chloe need to have a chat,

12:19.360 --> 12:20.680
cos she has hope for us,

12:20.760 --> 12:23.640
but right now I'm not ready for it.

12:29.680 --> 12:30.760
(boy) Oh!

12:34.840 --> 12:37.360
Is that Sam?
He won't get back with us.

12:37.440 --> 12:41.520
I want to try, but I feel he's not
gonna give us that second chance.

12:41.600 --> 12:44.920
He cannot stand me. I think it's cos
I kiss Chloe all the time.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.400
He was like, "How can I be with
someone who goes back to Marty?"

12:48.480 --> 12:50.720
It's not...
I've totally changed, 100%.

12:50.800 --> 12:52.320
Would you tell him that?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.520
When Sam comes in, I'll go,

12:55.600 --> 12:58.640
"Me and Chloe kissed
but it didn't mean anything."

12:58.720 --> 13:01.560
Hopefully they get back
with each other. If they do,

13:01.640 --> 13:04.600
then I can just shag Savannah
in the main room.

13:04.680 --> 13:08.480
All I can do is try.This takes
so much pressure off me and Marty.

13:08.560 --> 13:10.680
The attention will go from him
to Sam.

13:10.760 --> 13:14.080
With you girls here,
please don't go anywhere near him.

13:14.160 --> 13:17.160
Girls shouldn't do that.
If you care about someone,

13:17.240 --> 13:19.520
you shouldn't ask that.
This is fucked up.

13:19.600 --> 13:23.600
I've been trying to convince myself
I'm over Dean, but it's not working.

13:23.680 --> 13:27.200
Living with your ex is like
some kind of sick form of torture.

13:27.280 --> 13:30.280
Well, if you're feeling
the strain now, Stevie,

13:30.360 --> 13:34.960
you might just snap when the next ex
gets catapulted onto the beach.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.640
Whose ex is next?

13:37.720 --> 13:40.800
As the villa holds its breath
for Sam's arrival,

13:40.880 --> 13:44.560
Stevie's had the wind
taken out of her by ex Dean.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.320
Being around you is hard.
Are you struggling?

13:47.400 --> 13:49.040
Yeah, a little bit.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.640
It's like a delayed reaction
seeing Dean.

13:54.880 --> 13:57.880
I put on this big front,
but I have got a heart.

13:57.960 --> 13:59.280
I don't want her upset.

13:59.360 --> 14:02.120
You're the only person
I wanna talk to when I'm upset

14:02.200 --> 14:06.080
because you're the only person...
like, that properly knows me,

14:06.160 --> 14:07.360
you know what I mean?

14:07.440 --> 14:09.040
(snivels)

14:10.800 --> 14:13.480
Come on.
(mumbles, whimpers)

14:13.560 --> 14:15.200
Stop crying.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.720
Ah, this is hard. This is hard.

14:17.800 --> 14:21.200
I don't... I don't love her,
but I don't want to hurt her.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.600
You know I'm here for you.
I know, I know.

14:23.680 --> 14:27.000
I'm gonna distance myself from her.
I don't want to hurt her.

14:27.080 --> 14:30.280
But if she wants a ride,
well, then let's have it. (laughs)

14:30.360 --> 14:31.840
Oh, Deano...

14:31.920 --> 14:35.040
(laughs)
...you had to go and ruin it.

14:41.000 --> 14:44.000
What would you do
if they walked in holding hands?

14:44.080 --> 14:45.320
I'd be really angry.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.800
I'm feeling so nervous
with Sam coming in.

14:47.880 --> 14:50.720
I just hope he hasn't tried
to crack on with Georgia.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.800
Georgia has done bad things
but she has got respect.

14:53.880 --> 14:57.560
I wouldn't worry about Georgia.
She fucked with me, but still...

14:57.640 --> 15:00.480
Georgia isn't a normal person.
She clearly isn't.

15:00.560 --> 15:04.360
But if she does wanna jump into
my bed, "friends with benefits".

15:09.120 --> 15:11.640
This situation is so fucked up, man.

15:11.720 --> 15:14.600
I'm living with my ex
and the lad I like is coming in.

15:14.680 --> 15:17.000
My gut is literally in my arse.

15:17.080 --> 15:20.800
Oof! You should get that looked at.
Here we go.(cheering)

15:20.880 --> 15:22.880
He's got the same hair as Marty.

15:22.960 --> 15:25.680
Chloe was making out
this Sam was like a Greek god,

15:25.760 --> 15:27.120
beautiful, gorgeous.

15:27.200 --> 15:31.560
I'm looking at Marty, looking at
Sam, thinking, "You two are twins."

15:31.640 --> 15:35.320
You all right? (indistinct speech)
Yeah, I'm sweet, mate. You?

15:35.400 --> 15:36.920
Sound, man.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.480
I'm expecting this Sam kid
to come in kicking off with me.

15:40.560 --> 15:44.680
No, no. The only vibe I get from him
is, how feminine are you?

15:44.760 --> 15:47.320
Basically, on our date Sam says,

15:47.400 --> 15:50.400
"You're good-looking, I fancy you,"
whatever.

15:50.480 --> 15:52.520
He'd like to crack on with Georgia.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.080
I think tonight
it's best not to speak to Sam.

15:55.160 --> 15:58.360
Me and him will fucking argue
and I'll end up belting him.

15:58.440 --> 16:00.640
Have you come for Chloe
or something else?

16:00.720 --> 16:03.360
I think she needs to realise
she's over you.

16:03.440 --> 16:07.200
I need to take Sam away from this
conversation and have a one on one,

16:07.280 --> 16:10.880
cos Sam needs to realise that
me and Chloe now are just friends.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.840
I understand how it looks for you,

16:12.920 --> 16:16.400
to see Chloe, she says,
"I kissed Marty on the first night."

16:16.480 --> 16:20.320
If I was you, I'd be pissed off.
All she can do is talk about you.

16:20.400 --> 16:23.000
Martin wants to look like
the fucking good boy,

16:23.080 --> 16:25.920
but I know deep down
he's nothing but a little boy.

16:27.160 --> 16:30.920
I know that you two fucked last
year. For me, she ain't over you.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.720
I think you need to be here and
before you try getting with girls,

16:34.800 --> 16:39.000
spend a full day around me and her.
Then you're realise that we're not.

16:39.080 --> 16:42.040
It is what it is.
The case is closed for the minute.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.920
But I'm sure there'll be drama.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.640
I will be mates with Sam
for Chloe's sake.

16:46.720 --> 16:50.680
And if he tries to disrespect her
in here, I'll fuck him up.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.760
(laughs)
A friend in need is a friend indeed.

17:02.800 --> 17:07.040
After an unsuccessful date with Sam,
Georgia's craving male attention,

17:07.119 --> 17:09.119
and taking things to the max.

17:16.280 --> 17:19.200
I think she's still a bit of
a lunatic but I am in there.

17:23.480 --> 17:27.160
We're having fun. You can't go mad
if I crack on with anyone else.

17:27.240 --> 17:30.760
You go and do what you wanna do.
I'll do what I wanna do. Simple.

17:30.840 --> 17:35.000
Well, Max, looks like you got
yourself friends with benefits.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.640
No-one can fuck with the king.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.200
Apart from his queen.

17:40.200 --> 17:43.040
Lee seems like a nice guy
and different to the rest.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.640
She's a Scouser.
I love a Scouse accent.

17:59.560 --> 18:03.200
I feel a bit sorry for Max,
because he's a nice guy.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.960
Does she really think
she can get away with that?

18:10.040 --> 18:11.680
Fuck off!

18:16.600 --> 18:18.040
Max! Max!

18:18.120 --> 18:21.400
You want me to tell you
something interesting?Go on.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.600
Georgia... and Lee...

18:24.680 --> 18:26.040
Been kissing?

18:27.240 --> 18:31.680
Two minutes later she's cracking on
with Lee. Are you joking?

18:31.760 --> 18:34.800
I ain't getting hurt.
She's here for the wrong reasons.

18:34.880 --> 18:37.520
She's a snake and that upsets me.

18:37.600 --> 18:39.840
Tells me she wants
friends with benefits,

18:39.920 --> 18:42.720
but she's cracking on with
other lads. Fucking liar.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.560
I know the girl's a snake,
but I wanna bang the bird.

18:45.640 --> 18:48.920
She cracks on with me, with you,
cracks on with your pal.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.760
Now she's cracking on with Lee.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.920
Georgia is a rotten egg.

18:53.000 --> 18:56.520
I didn't know you were necking her.
I necked her 20 minutes ago.

18:56.600 --> 19:00.240
If I'd known they had been kissing,
I wouldn't have went near her.

19:00.320 --> 19:01.800
She rattles my cage.

19:01.880 --> 19:05.520
You rattle my cage and you know
you rattle my cage.What?

19:05.600 --> 19:07.640
We both said, at the end of it,

19:07.720 --> 19:10.400
you crack on if you want,
I'll do what I wanna do.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.320
And as soon as I do that,
he flips out.

19:13.400 --> 19:15.960
Were me and you not necking on
five minutes ago?

19:16.040 --> 19:17.080
I can do what I want.

19:18.680 --> 19:21.880
All you had to do was, "Let's not.
I wanna neck on with Lee."

19:21.960 --> 19:24.520
Not, "Yeah, let's be friends
with benefits..."

19:24.600 --> 19:27.560
I didn't say that, babe.
This girl's a fucking slag.

19:27.640 --> 19:31.080
You're an absolute moron,
an absolute joker.

19:31.160 --> 19:34.960
Max doesn't want me, but he doesn't
wanna see anyone else with me.

19:35.040 --> 19:38.880
Can anybody else see through her?
(shout over each other)

19:42.160 --> 19:45.000
Why are you fuming?
Cos I'm over you?

19:45.080 --> 19:48.000
Over me? Over me? Pfft!

19:48.080 --> 19:51.520
Get over yourself.If you think
that makes me jealous..

19:51.600 --> 19:55.400
I'm not trying to make you jealous.
If I cracked on with a bird in here,

19:55.480 --> 19:56.840
she'd be gutted.

19:56.920 --> 20:00.560
I swear, for the rest of the time
in here, do not speak to me.

20:00.640 --> 20:04.040
What have I done tonight?
I can't do with nothing about you.

20:04.120 --> 20:06.720
Shut the fuck up.
You ain't got a leg to stand on.

20:06.800 --> 20:08.920
We are over. I don't give a fuck.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.240
Max, fuck off and leave me alone.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.160
Whoo!

20:15.240 --> 20:16.760
She's such a bitch.

20:17.760 --> 20:19.680
Oh, poor Georgia.

20:19.760 --> 20:22.400
Maybe she should have been
a little more subtle.

20:22.480 --> 20:24.480
Secret danger kisses are one thing.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.520
But what do I do
to get a secret bang?

20:27.560 --> 20:31.120
I'm starting to get nervous
about this going any further.

20:31.200 --> 20:34.120
Chloe's not the person
to get on the wrong side of.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.480
But it is so hard to resist.

20:39.920 --> 20:41.320
I really wanna fuck her.

20:44.160 --> 20:47.520
I'm gonna end up with
the biggest balls in fucking Bali.

20:53.040 --> 20:55.240
With no-one going to sleep in pairs,

20:55.320 --> 20:58.800
Chloe's having
one last bite of the apple with Sam.

20:58.880 --> 21:01.560
I want to be with you. I do.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.360
Me and Chloe are trying
to talk through things.

21:04.440 --> 21:07.000
It's still very raw between us.

21:07.080 --> 21:11.360
You've changed me so much. Marty
was my type of lad, banter, funny.

21:11.440 --> 21:13.200
Now I like... plain ones.

21:13.280 --> 21:17.040
You're not that plain, but, like,
you're... you're a bit plainer.

21:17.120 --> 21:19.600
I'm not surprised
why Sam feels so angry.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.640
Cos he has been mugged off a bit.
I wanna be with you.

21:23.680 --> 21:26.400
As much as Chloe
does my fucking head in,

21:26.480 --> 21:29.000
I can't help keep thinking
all the good times.

21:32.800 --> 21:34.760
I'm not.
Chloe, don't fuck this up.

21:34.840 --> 21:38.080
I'm giving you one more chance.
Do not go running back to Marty.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.880
With Sam giving Chloe
a second chance,

21:43.960 --> 21:46.160
it seems Dean's looking for one
with Che.

21:47.200 --> 21:48.360
What do you mean, no?

21:48.440 --> 21:50.760
What are you trying to be muggy for?

21:50.840 --> 21:54.040
It's been a mental night.
But one thing I do know is

21:54.120 --> 21:56.160
I'm gonna try and get
Che back in bed,

21:56.240 --> 22:00.520
and let her ride the
choo-choo train. Coo-coo! (laughs)

22:00.600 --> 22:01.720
What do you mean?

22:03.640 --> 22:07.600
Stevie obviously has a lot more
feelings for Dean than she thought.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.120
She's moved on.

22:12.200 --> 22:13.360
She's not!

22:13.440 --> 22:17.320
Fuck this, I'm jumping ship.
I'll try and crack on with Stevie.

22:17.400 --> 22:19.840
Well, this won't be a train wreck.

22:31.480 --> 22:34.920
I did not expect on my first morning
to wake up next to Chloe.

22:35.000 --> 22:39.000
I can smell her terrible breath.
I don't even know how I got here.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.520
Did these two shag last night?

22:41.600 --> 22:42.680
No.
Did you not?

22:42.760 --> 22:44.840
Sam knows the crack.
I wanna be with Sam.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.760
We all know what it's like
when you've got feelings,

22:47.840 --> 22:50.040
there's a history,
and you've had a few.

22:50.120 --> 22:52.160
We need to see how she behaves.

22:52.240 --> 22:55.200
Chloe needs to respect that
I wanna take baby steps.

22:55.280 --> 22:59.120
I wanna just try and get back with
you. Even though I am very horny.

22:59.200 --> 23:01.840
I just need to keep my distance
away from Marty,

23:01.920 --> 23:04.320
so I can prove to Sam I'm over him.

23:04.400 --> 23:08.720
I'm getting bored with Savannah.
My life revolves around easy birds.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.880
And not being round them
at the minute, it's killing us.

23:11.960 --> 23:15.000
I still don't think Savannah's
ever gonna fuck me.

23:16.040 --> 23:19.480
I let myself down last night.
I kissed a girl I knew I shouldn't.

23:19.560 --> 23:23.560
I'm a proud geezer. When you
kick me down, I'm gonna be annoyed.

23:23.640 --> 23:25.840
If I'm in a relationship,
I'm committed.

23:25.920 --> 23:27.840
Obviously we never would be.

23:27.920 --> 23:31.320
I can't trust her. I need to move
on. I'm so much better than that.

23:31.400 --> 23:35.920
Basically what happened last night
Stevie jumped into bed with Deano.

23:36.000 --> 23:38.160
I'm confused about
the Dean situation.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.480
He says he's there for me,
we're friends,

23:40.560 --> 23:43.880
he cares in a mate's way. Then
he tells me to get in bed with him.

23:43.960 --> 23:46.800
Weren't you trying to crack on
with Che first and...

23:49.360 --> 23:50.440
Huh?

23:50.520 --> 23:53.080
Fucking hell, Brad, mate,
what are you doing?

23:55.280 --> 23:57.320
Was you trying to get with Che?
No.

23:57.400 --> 23:58.920
You're so full of shit.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.120
Is he joking?

24:00.200 --> 24:03.080
You're fucking horrible.
Why am I horrible?

24:03.160 --> 24:04.960
You just are.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.840
(sighs) I can't get my words out

24:06.920 --> 24:10.240
cos my head's all over the place.
I need to just have a minute.

24:11.560 --> 24:14.600
I've gone about things wrong
over the last few days,

24:14.680 --> 24:16.440
so I put on some Deano charm.

24:16.520 --> 24:18.720
Never know,
you could get a three-way.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.120
Oh, Dean, ever the optimist!

24:21.200 --> 24:24.360
You shouldn't be kissing her
if you don't like her.

24:24.440 --> 24:26.320
You're confusing her.

24:26.400 --> 24:30.000
What a dickhead.
This fella is fucking mental.

24:30.080 --> 24:32.640
It literally
makes you lose your shit.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.440
I do wish that
I had a bit more support in here.

24:37.160 --> 24:41.960
Be careful what you wish for, Che.
Some support isn't the kind you want.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.760
Next arrival, T minus ten hours.

24:47.320 --> 24:51.360
The Tablet of Terror sent them
all on a team-building exercise.

24:51.440 --> 24:55.280
As the old saying goes,
all's fair in love and paintball.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.920
I fucking love paintballing.

24:58.280 --> 25:01.320
I'm not a paintball guy.
I see myself more of a ref.

25:02.480 --> 25:03.760
Do they need a ref?

25:08.520 --> 25:11.920
My only target today is Dean.
I'm gonna try and make him bleed.

25:12.000 --> 25:14.480
(As Tony Montana)
I'm Demolition Deano.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.880
Have you met my little friend?
(gunshots)

25:17.800 --> 25:20.720
These planks don't have a clue
what will hit them.

25:21.800 --> 25:23.200
We are ready for war.

25:23.280 --> 25:26.960
And Marty and his bitches
are going down!

25:28.160 --> 25:30.520
Ready for me
to shoot you in the fanny.

25:30.600 --> 25:32.800
Then your boyfriend in the dick.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.080
Fuck all this. Let's just have it.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.520
Come on, then!
(hooter blares, laughter)

25:43.240 --> 25:46.960
(gunshots) It's fucking carnage!
Everyone's shooting each other.

25:47.040 --> 25:50.080
I'm getting shot
left, right and centre.

25:51.080 --> 25:54.760
I've only got one fucking target
and that's Marty McKenna.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.240
(Marty) Argh! Fuck!

25:58.320 --> 26:00.000
That will keep the prick quiet.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.440
Someone just blasted me in the ribs.

26:04.760 --> 26:07.840
That team is fucked,
squealing like little girls.

26:07.920 --> 26:10.400
Who fucking wants it, then?
(Stevie) Not me!

26:19.240 --> 26:21.440
Back! Che.

26:21.520 --> 26:22.840
Oop!

26:24.400 --> 26:25.480
Fucking hell.

26:25.560 --> 26:29.400
Me and Che haven't talked properly
about the shit with Dean.

26:29.480 --> 26:33.480
I know that me and you have...
I was pissed off at you.Yeah.

26:33.560 --> 26:36.240
Obviously I said
I wasn't keen on him.

26:36.320 --> 26:39.040
We went on the date
and the date was very romantic.

26:39.120 --> 26:42.440
You got in the moment?
I completely understand.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.920
Yeah, of course.
I would be pissed off, too.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.040
Me and Dean was just a shag.

26:47.120 --> 26:50.320
For Stevie it's different.
There's a lot more feelings.

26:50.400 --> 26:55.040
He hasn't even spoken to me today.
What the fuck? He's such a dick.

26:55.120 --> 26:58.680
All Dean had to do was come up to
me, apologise about last night.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.680
That way I wouldn't feel so angry.

27:00.760 --> 27:03.360
I didn't know he was trying
to get with you.

27:03.440 --> 27:07.840
He asked me to get in bed with him.
I was like, we're meant to be mates.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.000
He's meant to be this nice person.

27:10.080 --> 27:13.040
Don't try and be my mate
and then get me in bed with you.

27:13.120 --> 27:15.800
I'm not gonna talk to him.
He can do what he wants.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.600
I'm gonna go back tonight,
just see what happens,

27:18.680 --> 27:21.000
and not fucking speak to Dean.

27:21.080 --> 27:24.760
My emotions have been up and down
in this Dean situation.

27:24.840 --> 27:28.680
But after last night, I'm kind of
glad. I wanna steer clear of him.

27:28.760 --> 27:32.200
To be honest, I'm so glad
that you've came into this villa.

27:32.280 --> 27:34.360
You remind me
of my twin sister so much.

27:34.440 --> 27:39.320
I wish she was here. You are so like
her. She's fiery. It's really good.

27:39.400 --> 27:41.960
Those girls are all dry,
got no personality.

27:42.040 --> 27:43.720
Me and you will have a laugh.

27:43.800 --> 27:47.320
I've got your back from now on.
We'll have some fun.Yeah.

27:47.400 --> 27:49.800
(talk over each other, laugh)

28:07.760 --> 28:11.240
I've got a flag in my hand
but someone's fucking shooting me.

28:11.320 --> 28:13.520
What the fuck? (squeals)

28:13.600 --> 28:15.080
Stop, stop!

28:16.160 --> 28:17.880
Out!

28:17.960 --> 28:19.680
Stop.

28:23.240 --> 28:26.000
As testosterone levels
reach their maximum,

28:26.080 --> 28:29.280
the lads have snuck off
to discuss their feelings.

28:29.360 --> 28:32.240
Dean, where are you at
with the birds?I'd fuck Stevie.

28:32.320 --> 28:33.840
But I don't wanna hurt her.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.520
My initial plan was
to try and crack on with Che.

28:36.600 --> 28:39.280
But I've now kissed Ste...
It's all in the air.

28:39.360 --> 28:42.160
Yeah, Stevie likes you a lot.
She fucking does.

28:42.240 --> 28:46.040
I'm half glad I didn't fuck Stevie
last night. The girl's a nutter.

28:46.120 --> 28:47.840
She's clearly in love with me.

28:47.920 --> 28:52.400
I've fucked both of them now so I'd
rather a bit of new meat.(laughter)

28:52.480 --> 28:56.560
(indistinct) I don't think
any of the boys really trust Sam.

28:56.640 --> 28:59.960
I don't think anyone understands
the kid. I cannot read him.

29:00.040 --> 29:03.120
How the fuck is Chloe with him?
They are opposite.

29:03.200 --> 29:06.480
He's a camp version of you.
If he does pie Chloe off,

29:06.560 --> 29:09.440
who else is gonna get with him?
No-one.(laughter)

29:09.520 --> 29:11.280
Georgia's a bit desperate.

29:11.360 --> 29:14.360
I beat Sam
in every single aspect of life.

29:14.440 --> 29:17.080
I've got a better quiff,
I beat him at paintball,

29:17.160 --> 29:19.960
his bird still loves us,
and I'm a better shag.

29:22.480 --> 29:25.680
As the sun sets on Bali,
the devilish Tablet of Terror

29:25.760 --> 29:28.080
has thrown the villa
a fancy-dress party.

29:28.160 --> 29:30.240
Devils and angels!
(cheering)

29:30.320 --> 29:34.680
Chloe is wearing the right outfit.
She does look fucking naughty.

29:34.760 --> 29:37.200
The biggest devilish thing
anyone has done?

29:37.280 --> 29:40.160
I pinched someone's bike
at Christmas.(laughter)

29:40.240 --> 29:42.480
I stole someone's bike
on Christmas Day.

29:42.560 --> 29:44.600
And I'll never steal again.

29:44.680 --> 29:47.560
When me and Max broke up,
I slept with one of his mates.

29:47.640 --> 29:48.880
Most devilish thing.

29:48.960 --> 29:51.880
I'll be the first to admit that
and say I'm sorry.

29:51.960 --> 29:55.520
We're not going over this again.
No-one's asked about that.

29:55.600 --> 29:57.320
But I got asked the question.

29:58.320 --> 30:01.160
I shagged a bird, sent her home,

30:01.240 --> 30:04.200
just so I could get
another bird round and shagged her.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.560
What a knob he is.

30:05.640 --> 30:07.960
Let's mix this game up a bit.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.000
I wanna play the most devilish thing
done in this villa.

30:11.080 --> 30:13.760
I'll start. (imitates drumroll)

30:13.840 --> 30:17.640
I like being a little bastard,
so I wanna spice things up.

30:21.320 --> 30:26.440
I've been kissing Savannah for the
last four days. (cheering, laughter)

30:26.520 --> 30:29.080
Marty's gone and dropped us
right in it.

30:33.240 --> 30:35.920
I've been doing it away from Chloe
to respect her.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.120
Chloe hasn't even batted an eyelid.

30:38.200 --> 30:40.760
Did you know they'd been kissing?
No.

30:40.840 --> 30:42.960
Chloe, man, kick off!

30:45.800 --> 30:47.840
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

30:47.920 --> 30:52.160
If Sam wasn't here, I would be
annoyed. But my focus is on him.

30:52.240 --> 30:54.720
It's a thing about
doing it in front of her face.

30:54.800 --> 30:56.360
It's not behind her back?

30:56.440 --> 31:00.240
I can't believe they've been having
kisses and she's up Chloe's arse.

31:00.320 --> 31:05.000
You haven't been here from the start.
Can't fucking use that, you idiot!

31:05.080 --> 31:07.760
Fuck off, Stevie.
You're the fucking idiot.

31:07.840 --> 31:10.640
(shouting) If I had been there
from the start...

31:10.720 --> 31:13.440
Why the fuck
is Stevie going so ballistic?

31:13.520 --> 31:15.120
Does she wanna bounce on this?

31:15.200 --> 31:18.120
Don't say I haven't been here
from the start.

31:18.200 --> 31:21.600
Don't fucking talk to me like that!
I swear to you.

31:21.680 --> 31:25.000
Fuck off, you dickhead!
Why the fuck is she swilling me?

31:25.080 --> 31:29.520
You fucking... I swear to God!
Don't fucking talk to me like that!

31:29.600 --> 31:32.320
I swear to God.
What the fuck are you on about?

31:32.400 --> 31:35.760
Are you deaf? Do you want me
to get you a hearing aid?

31:35.840 --> 31:38.760
Stevie and Savannah have kicked off,
but Chloe...

31:38.840 --> 31:40.400
she's cush.

31:40.480 --> 31:43.920
I could have had that conversation
with Chloe at the right time.

31:44.000 --> 31:47.600
Now Marty's fucked it.
Now I've got an eyelash missing.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.760
With Chloe keeping her cool
after that bombshell,

31:52.840 --> 31:56.440
she's looking to score some
brownie points from her ex, Sam.

31:56.520 --> 31:58.920
I wasn't even arsed
and you didn't blink.

31:59.000 --> 32:02.920
Yeah, it's the right direction for
us, how you're being, yeah. It is.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.800
Chloe not kicking off
is definitely making me feel

32:05.880 --> 32:08.320
we're taking a step
in the right direction.

32:08.400 --> 32:12.000
I'm starting to see that you
and Martin are on a friend level.

32:12.080 --> 32:15.640
We're 100% friendly.But I think
the way you look at him sometimes

32:15.720 --> 32:19.880
is like...
is it 100% over between you two?

32:19.960 --> 32:22.680
I don't look at Marty like that
any more, I swear.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.760
It's early days, my second night.

32:24.840 --> 32:27.680
But me and Chloe
are 100% on the pathway.

32:27.760 --> 32:29.960
I'm glad you dressed
as the right person.

32:30.040 --> 32:33.480
I want some fucking hanky-panky.
I'm pure fucking horny.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.680
You're not.
I'm a fucking angel.

32:35.760 --> 32:39.240
Yes, I'm dressed as a fucking fairy
but things will get naughty.

32:39.320 --> 32:43.720
I can't be an angel 24/7.
And I am dressed as a fucking fairy.

32:45.400 --> 32:49.880
With Chloe on the stairway to heaven,
Max is dancing with the devil.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.080
Again.

32:51.160 --> 32:53.680
I would have loved
things to work with you.

32:53.760 --> 32:56.360
Friends.
Because we know one way or another,

32:56.440 --> 32:58.040
one's gonna hurt each other.

32:58.120 --> 33:01.000
The Georgia situation
needs to be put to bed.

33:01.080 --> 33:05.560
We both know we fancy each other,
we know we're sexually attracted.

33:05.640 --> 33:06.840
We have mint sex.

33:07.920 --> 33:12.440
But...I said you're the best sex
I've had, and you went, "It was OK."

33:12.520 --> 33:15.960
No, only because Sam said
you said I've got a small dick.

33:16.040 --> 33:19.120
Yeah, I said Max hasn't got
the biggest dick I've seen.

33:20.640 --> 33:23.560
But you are the best I ever had.
I don't want a big dick.

33:23.640 --> 33:26.760
I might have a little roger.
I don't give a fuck,

33:26.840 --> 33:28.560
cos I'm a world-class shagger.

33:34.120 --> 33:35.680
But we're not for each other.

33:35.760 --> 33:40.280
This proves that you can never have
friends with benefits.

33:40.360 --> 33:43.720
One person's gonna get hurt
and the other person confused.

33:43.800 --> 33:45.480
And that is the situation now.

33:45.560 --> 33:48.600
Let's be amicable. Let's be friends.
Still be friends.

33:48.680 --> 33:50.360
100%. Honestly.

33:50.440 --> 33:53.640
We seem not to be right
for each other, but tonight...

33:53.720 --> 33:55.080
we'll see what happens.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.800
You... are... bonkers.

33:57.880 --> 34:00.200
The villa's feeling heavenly
right now.

34:00.280 --> 34:03.840
Time to turn it back
to a living hell.

34:03.920 --> 34:06.000
Three, two, one.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.400
(tablet dings)

34:07.480 --> 34:09.280
(laughs evilly)

34:09.360 --> 34:12.960
Tablet of Terror, piss off!
And leave us alone!

34:13.040 --> 34:17.360
"The Tablet of Terror is in a
particularly devilish mood tonight."

34:17.440 --> 34:21.280
Oh! "Please welcome
your horny new arrival."

34:21.360 --> 34:23.560
"For every angel, you need a devil."

34:26.840 --> 34:28.320
Oh, my God!

34:32.320 --> 34:34.080
This is absolutely mental.

34:36.920 --> 34:39.199
(Stevie) No! Shut up!

34:45.880 --> 34:47.880
(shouting)

34:54.320 --> 34:56.840
Time to get this party started.

34:58.160 --> 35:01.080
It's my twin sister!
I look at the balcony,

35:01.160 --> 35:03.120
and there's Che!

35:05.160 --> 35:07.480
It's just an ugly version of Che.

35:08.920 --> 35:12.080
I couldn't be happier.
I've needed her here.

35:12.160 --> 35:13.840
I can't believe she showed up.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.440
I'm Leonie. I'm the evil twin.

35:20.520 --> 35:22.520
And I don't give a fuck.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.920
I'm a self-confessed bitch.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.680
It really pisses me off
when guys I've been with

35:31.760 --> 35:33.520
try getting about my sister.

35:33.600 --> 35:36.440
Like, one or the other,
you can't have both.

35:36.520 --> 35:41.160
I'm coming in to make sure
Che hasn't done anything stupid.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.400
And I'm here to shake shit up.

35:44.800 --> 35:49.080
Out of all the boys in this villa,
who do you fancy the most?

35:49.160 --> 35:51.760
Apart from him,
cos I'd have to belt you.

35:51.840 --> 35:54.360
Straight away, Chloe's in there,
"He's mine."

35:54.440 --> 35:56.880
We are not together.
I'm giving her a chance,

35:56.960 --> 35:59.200
but we are not boyfriend
and girlfriend.

35:59.280 --> 36:00.360
Him.

36:00.440 --> 36:03.080
Oh! Twins alike.

36:03.160 --> 36:04.600
I'm loving this.

36:04.680 --> 36:07.480
I fucked one,
it'd be rude not to fuck the other.

36:07.560 --> 36:10.520
We can get to know each other better.
Who's your ex?

36:10.600 --> 36:12.600
Your sister.
(laughter)

36:13.880 --> 36:17.760
Me and Che just do not shag
the same guys. Sorry, Dean.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.200
(laughter)
Fuck!

36:23.880 --> 36:25.720
After getting back on track,

36:25.800 --> 36:28.480
Leonie's arrival
has derailed Chloe and Sam.

36:28.560 --> 36:31.760
As soon as she's come in,
you've gone, "Not him."

36:31.840 --> 36:34.160
I don't understand
what I've done wrong.

36:34.240 --> 36:37.920
I told Leonie she can crack on
with anyone apart from Sam.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.480
Tell me if I'm fucking wrong.

36:40.560 --> 36:44.720
Trust us, she would not
fucking pick you anyway. Fuck off.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.200
I'm so fucking pissed off.

36:47.280 --> 36:51.080
What do you want from me?!
(shouts indistinctly) Would you?

36:52.240 --> 36:54.240
Fuck off, you skinny little fuck!

36:54.320 --> 36:56.120
Psycho prick, fuck off.

36:56.200 --> 36:59.600
Chloe's kicking off and not letting
me get a word in. Shock(!)

36:59.680 --> 37:02.400
This is exactly why
me and her do not work.

37:02.480 --> 37:05.080
Fucking dick!
Fuck that bullshit.

37:06.320 --> 37:09.400
What's he saying?
He went, "You put a hold on us."

37:09.480 --> 37:12.520
What do you want us to say?
"He's not mine? He's single?"

37:12.600 --> 37:15.200
I think the kid
is a fucking pure divvy.

37:15.280 --> 37:17.280
Where is he?
Don't say anything.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.680
Where is he? Martin.
Where is he?

37:19.760 --> 37:21.360
I will knock him straight out.

37:21.440 --> 37:25.400
Sam, kid! We need a word.

37:25.480 --> 37:29.720
Here comes Marty trying to be
a fucking hero. Fuck off.

37:29.800 --> 37:32.960
Why are you pulling Chloe out...
(talk over each other)

37:33.040 --> 37:35.560
You said to Chloe,
"She's cock-blocked us."

37:35.640 --> 37:39.440
What did I say to you upstairs?
You want us to send Leonie a signal?

37:39.520 --> 37:42.560
I went, "He's mine."
What do you want us to fucking say?

37:42.640 --> 37:45.520
Oh, fuck off.
Are you two teaming up now?

37:45.600 --> 37:48.000
I've tried to keep me cool
since Sam come in.

37:48.080 --> 37:50.840
But he has fucking made me so angry.

37:50.920 --> 37:53.600
If you wanna get with Chloe,
why didn't you shag her?

37:53.680 --> 37:56.520
I've got more respect for her.
Have you fuck, man!

37:56.600 --> 37:59.720
You're full of shit.
Who the fuck does he think he is?

37:59.800 --> 38:02.440
Fuck off.
You're a fucking little bitch.

38:02.520 --> 38:04.960
No, you're a little boy.
Lying little bitch.

38:08.120 --> 38:11.480
I'm on Marty's side cos he's
my best mate. I love the geezer.

38:11.560 --> 38:13.880
I understand
why Marty doesn't trust Sam.

38:13.960 --> 38:15.800
I don't know why the geezer's here.

38:18.440 --> 38:19.440
What's that, son?

38:19.520 --> 38:22.600
Oh! Oh! No!
What's that, son?

38:22.680 --> 38:25.160
I'll pull his little shit quiff
clean off.

38:25.240 --> 38:27.080
Do you wanna be here for Chloe?

38:27.160 --> 38:29.480
I have not tried to
crack on with anybody.

38:29.560 --> 38:33.880
Different circumstances, I'd slap
the head off you. Oh, fuck off.

38:33.960 --> 38:36.320
I'm surprised Marty's defending us.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.800
That shows he actually wants us
to be happy.

38:38.880 --> 38:40.440
Martin!
What?

38:46.480 --> 38:49.480
And look at her.
Who's she fucking gone off to?

38:49.560 --> 38:50.880
Who's she gone off to?

38:50.960 --> 38:52.960
Surprise, sur-fucking-prise.

38:53.040 --> 38:56.040
Chloe has tootled off
straight back to Marty.

38:56.120 --> 38:59.640
Who did you fucking run to there?
He stuck up for us.

38:59.720 --> 39:02.280
How can you trust her
when she's back to her ex?

39:02.360 --> 39:05.520
Still chasing your ex.
He's mugged you off for two years.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.880
Made her fucking bed
and she can lay in it.

39:07.960 --> 39:09.960
She has fucked it now.

39:10.305 --> 39:16.928
