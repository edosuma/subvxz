02:23.240 --> 02:25.160
-Congressman.
-General.

02:55.800 --> 02:58.720
Herzlich Willkommen in Berlin.

03:03.040 --> 03:04.480
Who is that guy?

03:04.680 --> 03:07.720
lt's Breimer. He's a congressman.

03:08.680 --> 03:11.680
-You're here for the peace conference?
-here to write about it.

03:11.880 --> 03:15.320
-You ever hear of The New Republic?
-No.

03:16.080 --> 03:19.080
The uniform is the Army's idea of a joke.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.040
You see any action?

03:23.480 --> 03:26.480
l was in London when Franz Bettmann
aimed one of his Roman candles...

03:26.680 --> 03:31.120
...about a hundred feet away from me.
Broke all my martini glasses.

03:31.960 --> 03:34.520
Who is Franz Bettmann?

03:34.720 --> 03:36.920
Bettmann, Von Braun.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.920
The Kraut brain trust,the guys who built the V-2s.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.080
l actually wrote a column about it.

03:43.360 --> 03:45.080
l wish l could write.

03:45.640 --> 03:48.880
l have some great stories l could tell.

03:50.600 --> 03:54.120
No sense beating up on the Germans.
The Russians are the enemy now.

03:54.120 --> 03:57.560
They're godless people. 
Go down to the railyard and see for yourself.

03:57.760 --> 04:01.120
Anything's not nailed down, they're taking it, sending it to Moscow.

04:01.160 --> 04:03.440
Well, why not? They took most of the bullets.

04:03.680 --> 04:07.560
We've been teaching the lvans to play
ball. Some of those fellas can really hit.

04:07.760 --> 04:09.960
l bet you can't wait
to go home, huh, soldier?

04:10.160 --> 04:13.080
oh Yes, sir. You know the Germans.
They make excellent Danish pastry...

04:13.080 --> 04:15.600
...but they can't bake apple pie like my mom.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.079
Nothing wrong with the Germans.

04:18.079 --> 04:20.720
Plenty of good German folk back in Schenectady.

04:41.680 --> 04:43.920
Oh, excuse me. 
Let me help you with that, sir.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.800
l got it, Tully.

04:46.000 --> 04:49.000
-Being helpful is all. 
-You know who's driving me tomorrow?

04:49.000 --> 04:52.840
Got my trip ticket. l'm your driver
for the duration of your stay in Berlin.

04:53.040 --> 04:55.760
And l got you...

04:55.960 --> 04:58.360
...a little housewarming present.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.120
Thanks, Tully.

05:00.320 --> 05:04.800
-See you in the morning. Say, 0800?
-0800.

05:07.400 --> 05:11.280
I wouldn't myself have sized him up that way, you know? 
Just meeting the guy...

05:11.480 --> 05:15.160
...you wouldn't think of him as a patsy.
That's what I loved about Berlin:

05:15.160 --> 05:19.280
Even a guy who wasn't a patsy back
home turned into one. It was inevitable.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.360
The city spread its legs.

05:21.560 --> 05:24.640
All that ''eat, drink and be merry'' bullshit, ''seize the day. ''

05:24.840 --> 05:26.760
It sure didn't make anyone smarter.

05:26.960 --> 05:29.080
And the best part of it was no one got hurt.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.760
There was too much money around for anybody to fall...

05:31.960 --> 05:33.640
...without a nice soft cushion.

05:33.840 --> 05:37.800
Occupation marks printed just for us.Funny money.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.800
It didn't feel like losing it when they lost it.

05:41.040 --> 05:43.640
The Russians, they had to spend it before they went home.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.120
Which was all anyone talked about: Going home.

05:46.160 --> 05:50.080
Everyone, even the Russians. 
God, who would ever want to?

05:50.280 --> 05:52.040
Say what you want about the war.

05:52.040 --> 05:55.080
I would never wish
for all those millions of people to die...

05:55.280 --> 05:59.120
...but the war was the best thing that ever happened to me.

05:59.320 --> 06:02.400
When you have money, then, for the first time in your life...

06:02.600 --> 06:05.680
...you understand it,what money does for you.

06:06.320 --> 06:10.040
Where before all you understood was not having it.

06:10.240 --> 06:14.320
Money allows you
to be who you truly are.

06:20.720 --> 06:23.280
So you like your job?

06:23.800 --> 06:25.080
What?

06:25.080 --> 06:26.640
Your job.

06:28.560 --> 06:29.840
Sure.

06:30.040 --> 06:32.080
Yeah?

06:33.640 --> 06:35.880
What are you doing with that cigarette?

06:36.080 --> 06:38.720
Waste not, want not.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.880
lt is a job, right?

06:41.080 --> 06:43.880
How do you like your job?

06:44.280 --> 06:46.880
How do you like working in the motor pool?

06:49.000 --> 06:50.520
What the hell does that mean?

06:51.520 --> 06:53.480
-Nothing.
-That doesn't even follow.

06:54.160 --> 06:55.280
Perhaps my English.

06:55.480 --> 06:58.920
Like you should be fucking Dwight
Eisenhower, Countess Roundheels?

06:59.120 --> 07:01.320
-l was making conversation.
-No, you weren't.

07:01.520 --> 07:04.000
That's what l was doing. Don't tell me my business.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.720
Two thousand yards of silk in the Russian zone.

07:06.920 --> 07:09.520
l get in and out anywhere.The British zone, the French.

07:09.720 --> 07:13.000
l got the vehicle. The motor pool's the best job in the fucking Army!

07:13.240 --> 07:15.080
l'm sorry.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.040
l thought you were going to help me get out of Germany.

07:54.080 --> 07:58.000
lt's gonna get harder,not easier. Watch.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.920
They put your name on a list,and then that's it.

08:12.920 --> 08:17.040
l forget sometimes what a boy you are.

08:17.640 --> 08:20.360
Such a boy.

08:22.920 --> 08:25.160
-A sweet little boy.
-No, cut it out.

08:25.200 --> 08:27.160
Does that bother you?

08:27.200 --> 08:29.120
Why should it?

08:29.360 --> 08:32.440
My husband was a boy too.

08:33.640 --> 08:37.600
A little boy who saw numbers in his head.

08:45.120 --> 08:47.320
l'm your fellow, okay?

08:47.520 --> 08:50.080
l'll get you out of here.

08:50.680 --> 08:53.120
You watch.

08:58.720 --> 09:01.480
My girl, she's not just a pretty face, no, sir.

09:01.720 --> 09:05.720
She won first prize last year with her rhubarb pie, 
and second with her gourds.

09:06.000 --> 09:09.160
-That's terrific, Tully.
-Oh, she's pretty terrific, sir.

09:09.400 --> 09:11.680
Any luck, l'll be home for the harvest dance.

09:11.880 --> 09:14.480
Well, at this rate we'll still be driving to Potsdam.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.840
Somebody got up on the wrong side of the bed.

09:18.040 --> 09:21.080
-Some son of a bitch stole my wallet.
-No kidding.

09:21.280 --> 09:24.840
lt must have been in that crowd at the airport.

09:25.080 --> 09:26.840
l can loan you money if you need it.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.080
Thanks, Tully.

09:30.080 --> 09:33.320
Don't want you to miss all the great things Berlin has to offer.

09:33.560 --> 09:35.840
l used to live here before the war.

09:36.080 --> 09:38.280
-Really? 
-Ran the AP bureau.

09:39.800 --> 09:42.600
They're not really gonna put the country on trial, are they?

09:42.800 --> 09:44.480
Do you think they shouldn't?

09:44.680 --> 09:46.760
Doesn't seem American to lock a person up...

09:46.960 --> 09:49.800
...for something they didn't have anything to do with.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.160
Somebody you know, Tully?

09:54.520 --> 09:56.160
l'm just saying.

09:56.160 --> 09:59.920
Well, there's a piece that would sell:
''Fallen Women of the Third Reich.''

10:01.080 --> 10:02.360
That's pretty raw, sir.

10:02.560 --> 10:06.120
Millions of people didn't disappear
because the elves came out at night.

10:06.160 --> 10:09.960
Your Fraulein knew exactly
what Hitler was doing. They all knew.

10:10.000 --> 10:13.120
-Did she lift a finger?
-You don't know a thing about her.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.680
And you do?

10:15.480 --> 10:18.000
Just because you're a German doesn't make you a Nazi.

10:24.720 --> 10:28.040
You heard Breimer.lt's on to the Russians.

10:28.040 --> 10:30.120
The next war.

10:30.120 --> 10:34.160
They'll leave your girlfriend alone unless 
there's some special reason not to.

10:34.160 --> 10:36.600
lt's gonna cost me
to get her out of Germany...

10:36.800 --> 10:39.120
...l can tell you that right now.

10:39.160 --> 10:41.480
l wish l could help you out, kid.

10:43.640 --> 10:44.920
You want an hour with her?

11:52.080 --> 11:54.680
Beautiful day, huh?

11:54.920 --> 11:57.880
Are you looking for an argument?

12:03.040 --> 12:06.680
l'm sorry l broke your tooth.
lt was an honest disagreement.

12:06.880 --> 12:08.080
What do you need?

12:08.280 --> 12:11.240
Papers.To get someone out of Germany.

12:11.440 --> 12:14.840
-A Nazi?
-Not a Nazi. A friend of mine.

12:15.040 --> 12:18.360
With what l've been through, you'd 
ask me to help a Nazi escape Germany?

12:18.600 --> 12:20.600
Hey, cry me a river.

12:20.800 --> 12:25.320
Fuck, everyone in this town's got a hard-luck story.

12:27.760 --> 12:30.480
You gonna help me or not?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.480
l'll see what l can do.

12:36.680 --> 12:39.200
Great. Just don't Jew me on the price.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.600
Lena?

13:40.560 --> 13:44.000
-Where's Emil Brandt?|-Who?

13:44.480 --> 13:48.560
-Emil Brandt.
-Who the fuck is Emil Brandt?

13:49.040 --> 13:51.000
-Where's Emil Brandt?
-Fuck you!

13:59.800 --> 14:01.280
Fuck!

14:30.880 --> 14:32.040
Who's Emil Brandt?

14:32.240 --> 14:34.280
-Emil?
-Who is he?

14:34.520 --> 14:37.480
They were looking for him in your place, Lena. Where is he?

14:37.720 --> 14:40.480
-He's dead.
-Don't lie to me!

14:40.680 --> 14:42.480
He died.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.160
He died in the war.

14:44.200 --> 14:47.120
Like you fucking know! Who is he?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.640
He was my husband.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.040
Lena?

14:58.520 --> 15:02.800
-Emil Brandt. That's your husband?
-Yes.

15:03.280 --> 15:04.800
l'm Lena Brandt.

15:05.720 --> 15:08.440
-A last name. What a cozy feeling.|-Tully--

15:08.680 --> 15:11.560
He must have done something
if they're hopped up to find him.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.760
l'm gonna find out sooner or later!

15:14.960 --> 15:16.720
He was a mathematician.

15:16.920 --> 15:20.320
He saw numbers in his head?
lt's bullshit! They broke my fucking arm!

15:20.520 --> 15:21.960
He was a nobody.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.160
-Somebody's secretary.
-Whose secretary?

15:24.360 --> 15:26.200
What does it matter who?

15:26.400 --> 15:28.800
My husband brought him his coffee
and took steno.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.720
When's the last time you saw him?

15:30.920 --> 15:32.680
Three-- Three years ago.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.560
l'm with you now, Tully.

15:34.760 --> 15:37.480
How am l supposed to help you, Lena,
if you won't help me?

15:39.120 --> 15:42.040
l would never hurt you, Tully.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.920
Never.

15:49.800 --> 15:51.720
You can get anything
on the black market.

15:52.280 --> 15:54.960
l talked to someone.
A little lop-cock, no legs...

15:55.160 --> 15:56.800
...but he can run down anything.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.120
He can get you on a train out.
That's what you want, right?

16:00.640 --> 16:03.800
They told me he was dead.

16:04.520 --> 16:08.280
One more dead, or not dead.

16:08.880 --> 16:11.120
Who would know?

16:14.800 --> 16:17.960
Poor, fucking stupid Lena.

16:19.160 --> 16:22.320
You don't know fucking nothing,do you?

17:05.240 --> 17:07.000
Hey, Sikorsky.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.720
What happened to your arm?

17:09.960 --> 17:13.640
Scotch from Scotland. Forty cases.

17:15.079 --> 17:16.119
Good?

17:16.359 --> 17:19.040
They flew it in for Churchill.

17:20.720 --> 17:22.119
Can't afford it.

17:22.400 --> 17:26.640
Hey, who's your comrade?
Don't worry, l'll give you a price.

17:40.120 --> 17:42.680
l got something else for you.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.960
Really? What's that?

17:45.160 --> 17:46.400
Emil Brandt.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.480
Remind me who that is.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.240
You should know.
You've been looking for him.

17:53.480 --> 17:54.760
Have l?

17:56.760 --> 18:00.080
Names, names, so many names.

18:00.320 --> 18:03.080
Maybe l should just turn him over 
to the Americans.

18:03.080 --> 18:04.400
Why don't you?

18:04.600 --> 18:07.000
Because when everyone else|pulls up their tents...

18:07.200 --> 18:10.320
...you lvans will be the only game in Berlin, and the fact is...

18:10.520 --> 18:13.280
-...l like it here.
-That's it?

18:13.480 --> 18:15.960
A favor?

18:19.440 --> 18:20.760
Two hundred thousand marks.

18:23.960 --> 18:28.320
lt's not like l'm asking for real money.
Have the printing press work overtime.

18:29.000 --> 18:32.000
Plus papers, so l can get my girlfriend
on a train out of here.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.320
The trouble is, Tully...

18:34.520 --> 18:38.480
...l have seen Emil Brandt's
death certificate with my own eyes.

18:39.520 --> 18:42.760
l thought you weren't looking for him.

18:52.160 --> 18:55.000
Now, let me do you a favor.

18:55.000 --> 19:00.160
You remind me of my son, a little bit
of a buffoon, but good-natured.

19:00.400 --> 19:04.160
Get out. Now. Before you get hurt.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.160
Suit yourself.

19:19.360 --> 19:23.000
l just gotta figure out how to get my girlfriend on that train.

19:24.160 --> 19:25.560
What's your girlfriend's name?

19:28.120 --> 19:30.360
Mrs. Emil Brandt.

19:30.560 --> 19:34.280
lmagine her surprise when he turned up like that.

19:34.560 --> 19:36.800
And mine too.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.000
Hey, Tully.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.120
l'll take your offer.

19:53.120 --> 19:55.600
Two hundred thousand marks.

19:57.280 --> 20:01.480
A lot to arrange, getting him out of the American zone. You follow?

20:02.880 --> 20:06.800
Come back in two hours.l'll advance you half.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.160
And bring Mrs. Brandt.

20:38.120 --> 20:40.160
l'm not going with you to the Russian zone.

20:40.400 --> 20:42.960
Lena, half up front,1 00,000 marks.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.160
Have you checked
the exchange rate lately?

20:45.200 --> 20:47.760
What happens when they find out
you don't have Emil?

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
What happens is, we're in London
with 1 0,000 fucking dollars.

20:51.200 --> 20:53.400
You're out, l'm out.
lt's a perfect plan.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.520
l won't go to the Russian zone.l won't.

20:56.080 --> 20:59.960
He just wants to see you. What's the big deal? 
He wants to know l have him.

21:00.160 --> 21:04.040
-But you don't have him.
-You're out selling love you don't have.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.920
Hey, fish.

21:09.120 --> 21:11.760
l had to hitch a ride from the conference. What happened?

21:11.960 --> 21:13.080
Blow.

21:13.320 --> 21:16.800
l hate to pull rank on you,but you are my fucking driver.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.160
l'm off the clock, sir.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.000
Lena?

21:38.200 --> 21:39.920
l'm off the clock too.

21:40.840 --> 21:43.920
l'll pick you up in the morning.
l'm in the middle of something.

21:44.120 --> 21:46.560
-We know each other.
-l'm in the middle of something.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.360
-What happened to you?
-l need a minute to think, Tully.

21:49.600 --> 21:52.160
You can think on the way.

21:52.160 --> 21:55.160
-Hey, don't push her around like that.
-Fuck you!

21:56.080 --> 21:58.280
Move!

22:05.720 --> 22:07.240
Get in.

22:07.440 --> 22:09.600
Hey!

22:12.360 --> 22:14.160
-Tully, stop.
-Shut up!

22:16.120 --> 22:17.480
Stupid fuck!

22:31.240 --> 22:35.040
They gave me a choice:London or Berlin.

22:35.040 --> 22:37.080
For me there was no choice.

22:37.080 --> 22:40.800
The minute it came over the wire
that the war in Europe was finally over...

22:41.000 --> 22:43.440
...all I thought of was Lena.

22:44.320 --> 22:46.720
I didn't expect to run into her.|Not that way.

22:46.920 --> 22:49.080
Not my first week in town.

22:49.280 --> 22:51.040
But that was just like Lena.

22:51.040 --> 22:54.120
She always kept me off balance.

22:54.200 --> 22:57.680
Tully wouldn't be a problem,or not anything I couldn't figure out.

22:57.880 --> 23:00.720
I just had to find her again.

23:01.720 --> 23:03.480
I knew the bartender would help.

23:03.680 --> 23:07.120
Tell a bartender you're looking for
a friend, and you have two friends:

23:07.120 --> 23:10.880
Him, and the girl he steers you to.

23:11.080 --> 23:13.120
-What the hell is she doing with him?
-Who?

23:13.320 --> 23:14.840
-Lena.|-Tully?

23:15.040 --> 23:17.520
He's not a bad sort.|Just a bit of a cunt.

23:17.720 --> 23:19.360
Yesterday he tried to pimp her to me.

23:20.200 --> 23:23.640
Well, she and her friend Hannelore
come around and cheer up the Gls.

23:23.840 --> 23:25.040
We're all trying to get by.

23:25.240 --> 23:30.040
This whole goddamn country,she winds up fucking my fucking driver.

23:30.080 --> 23:31.320
Oh, you knew her?

23:31.560 --> 23:33.360
l hired her as a stringer.

23:33.560 --> 23:35.920
Her husband was never home.There were no kids.

23:36.120 --> 23:39.160
She got tired of rattling around the house all day.

23:39.160 --> 23:41.560
She was good at it too.

23:41.760 --> 23:45.560
She could get people to do things,
and they didn't know how she did it.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.920
-You were screwing your secretary.
-Stringer.

23:48.120 --> 23:49.320
Sorry.

23:49.520 --> 23:52.160
What the hell does it mean
she's with him, anyway?

23:53.520 --> 23:55.960
She seems to have made
quite an impression on you.

23:59.080 --> 24:03.000
l just didn't expect
l'd find her like this.

24:04.000 --> 24:05.880
l didn't expect l'd find her.

24:06.640 --> 24:10.040
When you say to yourself,
''That's the worst thing l've ever heard'' ...

24:10.040 --> 24:15.160
...stick around.
That's Berlin. Now it is.

24:15.360 --> 24:18.760
There's always something worse.

24:55.560 --> 25:00.600
-Geismer. G-E-l-S-M-E-R. Geismer.
-Yes, yes, l understand.

25:00.800 --> 25:04.000
l'm sorry, The New Republic
is not credentialed for today's schedule.

25:04.200 --> 25:08.040
-We can't have you without a press card.
-l told you my wallet was stolen.

25:08.080 --> 25:09.880
l have a line of people behind you.

25:10.120 --> 25:13.040
You should speak to General Sikorsky.
He's in charge of security.

25:18.360 --> 25:19.520
Where's Charlie Ross?

25:19.720 --> 25:25.080
l played poker with him in St. Louis.
lf l could just talk to Charlie Ross.

25:25.840 --> 25:28.240
Oh, fuck a duck.

25:29.680 --> 25:31.800
General, over here, please.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.480
Welcome.

25:36.000 --> 25:38.640
Wonderful, wonderful.

25:39.080 --> 25:40.520
Congratulations.

27:22.960 --> 27:24.480
General.

27:31.640 --> 27:34.280
General, l'm with the office
of the military governor.

27:34.520 --> 27:37.880
l'll be escorting the captain
back to the American zone.

28:24.920 --> 28:27.400
Were you with Corporal Tully
last night?

28:27.640 --> 28:30.640
l was in a club up till dawn|drinking with the bartender...

28:30.880 --> 28:33.600
...if your girl Friday
had bothered to check.

28:34.040 --> 28:37.880
Checkpoint recorded Jacob Geismer
crossing into the Russian zone...

28:38.080 --> 28:40.120
...just after midnight.

28:43.920 --> 28:46.120
-Fucking Tully.|-What's that?

28:46.120 --> 28:48.160
My wallet was stolen at the airport.

28:48.360 --> 28:51.080
-Did you report it?
-lt's not exactly a war crime.

28:51.080 --> 28:52.880
Where did you get those bruises?

28:53.080 --> 28:54.760
l got in a fight with Tully.

28:54.960 --> 28:57.360
-Over...?
-He rode the brake.

28:59.480 --> 29:01.600
Wasn't over a girl, was it?

29:03.120 --> 29:07.120
He was supposed to pick me up.
He didn't show. l got pissy about it.

29:09.000 --> 29:11.280
The Russians want this to go away.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.960
An American serviceman turns up dead|in Potsdam...

29:14.160 --> 29:16.360
...on the eve of the peace conference?

29:16.880 --> 29:18.880
lt's pretty damn embarrassing.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.800
Good news for you, frankly.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.880
We want it to go away too.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.200
Well, maybe l should talk directly
to the MG.

29:26.400 --> 29:28.080
He won't wanna bother with this.

29:28.280 --> 29:31.200
He doesn't wanna know
what Tully was doing in Potsdam?

29:31.480 --> 29:33.960
We're doing a hell of a job in Berlin.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.120
ls there a black market? Sure there is.

29:36.120 --> 29:38.920
Are some of our boys involved in it?
Yes, they are.

29:39.160 --> 29:42.440
-lf the Russians killed Tully--
-Then he deserved whatever he got.

29:42.680 --> 29:45.320
And his poor family
doesn't need to know anything more...

29:45.520 --> 29:48.800
...than that he crashed his jeep
trying to avoid a bunny rabbit.

29:49.000 --> 29:51.800
We're not gonna start World War lll
over some dumb Gl...

29:52.040 --> 29:54.520
...who got his dick stuck
in a pitchpot.

29:55.120 --> 29:58.640
You stay out of the Russian sector
for the rest of your time here.

29:58.840 --> 30:01.120
Now, we can't protect you over there.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.280
Thanks.

30:11.800 --> 30:13.480
And if you find that girl...

30:17.840 --> 30:19.440
...we'd like to talk to her.

30:49.520 --> 30:53.800
Kids. Two months ago,they were shooting at us.

31:24.080 --> 31:27.040
lf it isn't Jake Geismer.
Who did you insult this time?

31:27.080 --> 31:30.280
-You got a second? l'll tell you.
-Yeah, why don't we catch up?

31:30.480 --> 31:33.240
-How's 1 946?
-You mean you're not interested?

31:33.440 --> 31:36.040
l know you, Jake. We're a long way
from South Street.

31:36.040 --> 31:40.120
That's funny. l haven't met a DA yet
that could resist a murder.

31:45.680 --> 31:49.040
Nothing better for a prosecutor
than a criminal with a sense of history.

31:49.280 --> 31:52.280
Everything got written down.
Who they killed and what it cost.

31:52.520 --> 31:55.120
Meticulous record keepers.

31:56.000 --> 32:02.160
--forces from the west are poised
to strike the final blows upon Japan.

32:02.360 --> 32:07.080
This military power is sustained
and inspired by the determination...

32:07.080 --> 32:11.280
...of all the Allied nations
to prosecute the war against Japan...

32:11.480 --> 32:14.600
-...until she ceases to exist.
-lt looks like you're putting...

32:14.840 --> 32:18.080
-...the whole country on trial.
-These are just the active cases.

32:18.080 --> 32:20.880
The rest are kept under
lock and key at Kransberg.

32:21.120 --> 32:23.920
They want me to decide
who the ardent Nazis were.

32:24.120 --> 32:27.960
Truth is, it was the whole country.
Nobody's hands are clean.

32:28.160 --> 32:30.920
Twenty-hour days
just to get my arms around it.

32:31.120 --> 32:33.640
So, what's the murder
you wanted to tell me about?

32:38.640 --> 32:41.360
What, Gunther?
He used to be a cop here in Berlin.

32:41.560 --> 32:44.320
Don't worry, he doesn't
speak a word of English.

32:45.000 --> 32:48.120
My driver, a kid named Tully,
turned up dead in Potsdam.

32:48.120 --> 32:50.240
Potsdam? Potsdam's closed
for the conference.

32:50.440 --> 32:53.120
Whoever wanted him dead
had access to the delegations.

32:53.120 --> 32:55.920
-That's somebody high up.
-Why haven't l heard about it?

32:56.160 --> 32:59.040
Muller didn't want you to.
He ordered me to leave it alone.

32:59.080 --> 33:01.640
Nobody around here's
acting like the war is over.

33:01.920 --> 33:05.320
Not the Russians. Not the MG.

33:05.600 --> 33:07.960
-What's your angle?
-Why should l have an angle?

33:08.160 --> 33:09.560
lt just doesn't sound like you.

33:09.760 --> 33:13.360
You came home, all you talked about
was what a great lay your secretary was.

33:13.560 --> 33:15.880
-Stringer.
-Stringer. Sorry.

33:16.080 --> 33:19.440
A bullet through the chest, in the river.
lt's like it never happened.

33:19.640 --> 33:23.040
lsn't that what we fought a war about?
Even a louse like Tully?

33:26.040 --> 33:27.680
Okay.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.680
Okay.

33:30.600 --> 33:31.800
What?

33:32.040 --> 33:36.000
The Russians will have to do
a police report. Can you get me a copy?

33:39.720 --> 33:43.000
This guy drove one of the gas vans.

33:43.000 --> 33:46.840
They would load the Jews in back,
run the exhaust inside.

33:47.040 --> 33:51.120
By the time they got where they were
going, they were dead. Very efficient.

33:51.360 --> 33:54.720
Driving to work he killed more people
than Al Capone in all his years.

33:54.960 --> 33:59.040
But if you asked him,
he isn't a murderer, he's a truck driver.

33:59.040 --> 34:01.360
And he still thinks that.

34:03.920 --> 34:06.480
Thanks, Bernie. l owe you one.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.560
Thank you, Danny.

35:18.120 --> 35:22.160
l can't be out after curfew.
Would you walk with me?

35:51.200 --> 35:53.400
You live here with someone?

35:54.880 --> 35:56.440
Big man.

35:56.640 --> 35:59.040
You want two girls?

36:03.080 --> 36:05.080
You know a girl named Lena?

36:06.000 --> 36:08.000
Who told you about Lena?

36:08.000 --> 36:10.760
l'm not trying to get something
for nothing.

36:13.160 --> 36:15.880
Aren't you going to offer me
a cigarette?

36:20.800 --> 36:23.000
l didn't see her at the club.

36:24.160 --> 36:25.880
Skinny Lena.

36:26.080 --> 36:29.920
A big Yank in the saddle,
you'd break her in two.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.640
Can l look in your bedroom?

36:55.960 --> 36:59.680
Come. Fuck me, Dutch.

37:11.000 --> 37:14.040
The princess,
who knows where she is?

37:17.080 --> 37:20.080
Lena was raped by the Russians.

37:20.080 --> 37:22.920
You'll get yourself a good dose.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.720
l apologize if l hurt your feelings.

37:31.960 --> 37:34.000
She's not so special.

37:34.040 --> 37:37.560
They raped everyone:
cripples, children.

37:57.080 --> 37:59.720
How did you find this place?

38:05.920 --> 38:07.760
Five hundred just to talk.

38:08.760 --> 38:11.360
That's what l call a real pervert.

38:14.120 --> 38:16.600
Take a couple hours off, would you?

38:55.640 --> 38:57.840
l have nothing to be ashamed of.

38:58.040 --> 39:01.800
-l didn't say you did.
-The war, it's convenient.

39:02.040 --> 39:05.200
We can all blame everything
on the war.

39:06.040 --> 39:07.840
lsn't that why you left?

39:08.680 --> 39:10.320
The war?

39:12.680 --> 39:15.000
l found that blue dress l bought you.

39:15.240 --> 39:18.800
All the old things. All the old times.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.000
This is my life now.

39:21.200 --> 39:23.200
Tully at least understood that.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.520
What was Tully doing
in Potsdam last night?

39:26.800 --> 39:29.320
-l don't know.
-You weren't with him?

39:29.520 --> 39:32.680
Potsdam is in the Russian zone.
l don't go to the Russian zone.

39:34.560 --> 39:37.840
Lena, if l can find you, so can they.

39:39.080 --> 39:41.800
As if l'm the only one|who needed help.

39:42.040 --> 39:45.360
-Look at you.
-What is it you're not telling me?

39:47.120 --> 39:49.040
lt couldn't be that l loved him?

39:49.480 --> 39:52.040
You don't need
to be afraid of him anymore.

39:52.240 --> 39:54.120
You don't need
to protect him anymore.

39:57.080 --> 39:59.480
l think if you hadn't left, Jacob...

39:59.680 --> 40:02.520
...nothing would be any different.

40:03.080 --> 40:04.520
Nothing.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.720
lf.

40:14.480 --> 40:17.600
lf you want to stay, it's 500 marks.

40:18.360 --> 40:20.160
Make up your mind.

40:22.000 --> 40:24.320
l'm going to sleep.

41:00.160 --> 41:01.520
Did you get the report?

41:01.720 --> 41:05.120
l had to get it from a friend of mine.
Even Muller hasn't seen that yet.

41:05.320 --> 41:09.120
-lnteresting reading?
-They found 50,000 marks on him.

41:09.120 --> 41:11.960
So figuring they stole half, 1 00?

41:12.160 --> 41:15.600
They found a slug lodged
in his backpack, .32 caliber.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.320
Our guns are .45.

41:21.320 --> 41:23.000
Thanks.

41:32.040 --> 41:34.760
Now, listen,
l'm the first to recognize...

41:34.960 --> 41:37.960
...there were excesses
in the Nazi leadership.

41:38.160 --> 41:41.760
But if we besmirch an entire people
because of a few bad apples...

41:41.960 --> 41:43.560
...we're no better than Hitler.

41:43.760 --> 41:47.440
Then it's not about war crimes at all.

41:48.240 --> 41:50.400
lt's about revenge.

41:54.440 --> 41:57.960
Revenge. Right. Got it.

41:58.360 --> 42:01.280
Exactly. Revenge.

43:15.080 --> 43:18.160
l found that in the dirt
where Tully's body washed up.

43:18.960 --> 43:24.160
The little dash that you'll sometimes find
near the serial number? lt's not there.

43:27.120 --> 43:30.120
-That's meaningful?
-lt means Tully had something to sell.

43:30.160 --> 43:32.160
Something that our side
badly wanted...

43:32.160 --> 43:34.760
...and you very badly
didn't want us to have.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
You solved it
the way Russians know how to:

43:37.200 --> 43:41.120
You put a bullet in him. ln Potsdam.
Where he thought he'd be safe.

43:43.240 --> 43:45.320
All that from a mark of punctuation.

43:45.560 --> 43:47.800
No dash means that it's American.

43:48.000 --> 43:51.120
You could check it against the money
you stole from him...

43:51.320 --> 43:53.400
...if you felt like it.

44:29.120 --> 44:31.000
l was expecting Tully that night.

44:32.280 --> 44:34.040
Here. Not in Potsdam.

44:34.280 --> 44:36.160
He never showed up.

44:36.240 --> 44:40.040
lnstead of the usual Scotch
and cameras, he was selling...

44:40.240 --> 44:44.480
...for the price of 200,000 marks,a man...

44:46.040 --> 44:48.160
...named Emil Brandt.

44:51.600 --> 44:54.040
What's so interesting
about Emil Brandt?

44:56.640 --> 44:59.240
The Americans were looking for him.

44:59.440 --> 45:00.920
That made me curious.

45:02.080 --> 45:06.280
We pack up entire factories
and ship them back to Moscow.

45:06.480 --> 45:08.640
Now the peace conference...

45:08.880 --> 45:13.040
...Poland, Romania,half of Europe, a windfall.

45:13.240 --> 45:16.200
Something for the sacrifice and suffering.

45:16.440 --> 45:18.680
Now ask yourself:

45:19.080 --> 45:20.920
What do the Americans get?

45:22.120 --> 45:25.320
Sounds to me like we're getting a good fleecing.

45:28.720 --> 45:32.880
You may not be as safe
on the American side as you think.

45:52.080 --> 45:54.160
Hannelore, Lena.

48:22.840 --> 48:25.720
Even radar couldn't find you here.

48:26.160 --> 48:28.320
Of course, you won't be earning...

48:28.560 --> 48:32.080
...but Jacob here volunteered
to carry you girls on the cuff...

48:32.080 --> 48:34.120
...till things have settled down.

48:34.360 --> 48:36.920
l'll check in on you when l can.

48:38.600 --> 48:41.480
As long as it's on the cuff
and not on my back.

48:41.680 --> 48:43.960
He gives me the creeps.

48:44.680 --> 48:48.160
Fixing your mouth,
with where it's going, sweetheart?

48:48.960 --> 48:50.720
Let's give them a minute.

49:02.000 --> 49:03.960
l don't want you to go out anymore.

49:04.160 --> 49:06.800
lt's a good thing l wasn't there,
don't you think?

49:07.040 --> 49:10.400
-l went for a loaf of bread.
-l can bring you anything you need.

49:12.880 --> 49:15.640
Stare at the same four walls.

49:15.880 --> 49:17.520
l'd go mad.

49:18.800 --> 49:23.560
You wanna tell me why Emil would be
worth 1 00,000 marks to someone?

49:24.800 --> 49:26.160
There'd be no reason.

49:26.360 --> 49:29.360
That's how much money
they found on Tully's body.

49:30.640 --> 49:32.400
That doesn't make any sense.

49:32.600 --> 49:34.720
Might have been nice to know,
Mrs. Brandt...

49:35.000 --> 49:37.400
...that Tully was auctioning off
your husband.

49:37.640 --> 49:40.440
We never talked
about Emil, remember?

49:40.640 --> 49:42.960
One of our rules.

49:43.160 --> 49:45.040
An affair has more rules
than marriage.

49:45.240 --> 49:48.680
The Americans are looking for him,
and the Russians. Why?

49:48.920 --> 49:51.040
-l don't know.|-Where is he, Lena? Where's Emil?

49:51.240 --> 49:54.600
Emil's dead. He died six months ago
in the bombing.

49:54.800 --> 49:57.240
Tully found out the Americans
were looking for Emil...

49:57.440 --> 50:01.960
...so he offered him to the Russians.
One of his schemes. Stupid.

50:02.160 --> 50:05.760
A way to get money to get me
out of Germany. Sell them a dead man.

50:05.960 --> 50:09.200
Now he's dead too. Maybe you next,
if you don't watch yourself.

50:09.440 --> 50:11.600
This isn't gonna go away
because Tully's dead.

50:11.840 --> 50:13.840
-That's all l know.
-Emil was with the SS?

50:14.080 --> 50:15.720
Two years ago they all got uniforms.

50:15.960 --> 50:17.400
-Who knows why?
-Stop lying to me.

50:17.640 --> 50:20.960
l'm a Nazi myself, did you know that?
lt's true.

50:21.000 --> 50:23.440
-You're not a Nazi.
-No, not a Nazi. None of us.

50:23.640 --> 50:25.880
Just something to join,
like a sport club.

50:26.080 --> 50:29.040
How could you fuck someone
for all those years and not know them?

50:29.240 --> 50:31.440
-Stop it.
-Did you ever fuck a Nazi?

50:31.680 --> 50:33.120
-Cut it out.
-How about a Jew?

50:33.120 --> 50:36.520
-Why won't you let me help you?
-A Nazi and a Jew both, better yet.

50:36.800 --> 50:40.200
-You did nothing wrong!
-l survived.

51:20.120 --> 51:22.920
What happened
to the rest of your family?

51:23.720 --> 51:26.320
They got sent to the camps.

51:26.520 --> 51:30.760
Everyone. My mother, uncles, cousins.

51:30.960 --> 51:33.200
Everyone dead.

51:33.440 --> 51:36.480
As the wife of an SS man...

51:36.680 --> 51:38.280
...l was exempt.

51:38.480 --> 51:42.600
''A Jewess is not a Jew,''
that's the way they used to put it.

51:43.520 --> 51:46.760
lt's not something
l have ever told anyone.

51:48.200 --> 51:50.320
And at the end...

51:51.080 --> 51:53.680
...no one was exempt.

51:55.320 --> 52:00.160
Hannelore told me
that you were raped by a Russian?

52:00.360 --> 52:02.800
Hannelore can't tell a joke.

52:03.000 --> 52:06.560
-l didn't realize it was funny.
-Hannelore's funny.

52:06.760 --> 52:10.560
-She always leaves something out.
-Why?

52:11.000 --> 52:13.160
What did she leave out?

52:32.360 --> 52:35.360
And then l met Tully.

52:54.600 --> 52:58.560
God in heaven, l never thought
l'd eat real ham again.

53:01.160 --> 53:02.880
Aren't you gonna have any?

53:03.080 --> 53:05.600
-None for me.|-No?

53:06.000 --> 53:08.640
ls that a Jewish name, Jacob?

53:08.840 --> 53:11.440
The way you're eating that ham
could turn anyone kosher.

53:16.040 --> 53:19.120
lt's easy now to say Hitler
was wrong about the Jews.

53:19.120 --> 53:23.880
Let me tell you something.
Nobody said he was wrong at the time.

53:30.000 --> 53:31.320
You're up early.

53:33.280 --> 53:35.680
l went down to the PX first thing
and stocked up.

53:35.880 --> 53:37.080
Do you want some coffee?

53:38.640 --> 53:40.720
Real coffee.

53:41.320 --> 53:44.120
No wonder you won the war,eating like this.

53:44.680 --> 53:47.600
The little girl in the photograph,
is that Dora?

53:48.080 --> 53:49.960
The notebook said ''Dora.''

53:50.000 --> 53:52.960
What do you think you'll find in here?

53:53.000 --> 53:55.600
lt's all l have left of him.

53:57.600 --> 54:02.000
Very dramatic, the princess.

54:03.480 --> 54:05.240
Don't believe her.

54:05.480 --> 54:08.200
She didn't give two shits for him,
alive or dead.

54:08.400 --> 54:11.360
Dragging around that shrine
of crap and papers.

54:11.640 --> 54:14.920
Meanwhile, fucking with you
the whole time before the war.

54:16.080 --> 54:18.160
She'd make you a good wife, Lena.

54:18.360 --> 54:21.080
She knows all the tricks.

54:33.280 --> 54:35.200
At ease.

54:35.440 --> 54:37.800
Jake, come on into my office.

54:42.040 --> 54:46.360
lt takes two MPs to invite a friend over?
No wonder you don't get many dates.

54:46.560 --> 54:49.240
You haven't been home
the last couple of nights. How come?

54:49.440 --> 54:51.960
-Keeping tabs on me, Bernie?
-Those are classified.

54:52.160 --> 54:53.200
l can keep a secret.

54:53.400 --> 54:55.760
What the hell happened between you
and Sikorsky?

54:55.960 --> 54:57.160
Who's asking, you or Muller?

54:57.760 --> 55:00.960
Don't be stupid.
Muller thought l should arrest you.

55:01.120 --> 55:02.560
Like you just did?

55:03.200 --> 55:05.240
What happened to your ear?

55:05.560 --> 55:08.760
Sikorsky says it's safer for me
on the Russian side than on ours.

55:09.000 --> 55:12.000
-l'm starting to think he's right.
-What else did Sikorsky say?

55:12.040 --> 55:15.000
Come on, l show up in Berlin,
and the driver assigned to me...

55:15.200 --> 55:18.400
...is running around with my old
girlfriend? That's a coincidence.

55:18.800 --> 55:20.880
l knew it was a mistake
to try to help you.

55:21.080 --> 55:24.120
You put me in a car with Tully
because you want Emil Brandt.

55:25.160 --> 55:27.080
-Why?
-My apologies, Jake.

55:27.280 --> 55:30.160
But l'm spending my days
trying to find Adolf Eichmann...

55:30.160 --> 55:32.080
...not filling out trip tickets.

55:32.800 --> 55:35.560
Why don't you get some sleep?
You look like shit.

55:36.160 --> 55:37.200
Thanks for coming in.

55:39.560 --> 55:43.400
We're speaking to you from the end
of a long, smooth runway of an airfield--

55:43.600 --> 55:46.600
-Hi.
-Can l help you, sir?

55:46.840 --> 55:48.600
l need a trip ticket.

55:48.880 --> 55:50.920
That's form 48.

55:58.040 --> 56:02.000
Thank you. Now, if l wanted
to request a specific driver--?

56:02.000 --> 56:06.800
-The same form. Just fill in the name.
-lt's a fella l used a few days ago.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.760
Could you pull that trip ticket?

56:08.960 --> 56:12.040
-What's your name, sir?
-Geismer.

56:17.040 --> 56:20.400
G-E-l-S....

56:29.080 --> 56:32.080
-Thank you.
-You're welcome, sir.

58:17.080 --> 58:18.480
Emil Brandt.

59:20.680 --> 59:23.000
Champagne from the cellar
of Admiral Donitz.

59:23.200 --> 59:25.040
Care for some?

59:25.600 --> 59:28.280
-l wouldn't want it to go to waste.
-Size of the bubbles.

59:28.520 --> 59:31.280
Smaller the better,
that's the key to champagne.

59:31.520 --> 59:36.880
This time last year l was in Anzio,
up to my balls in mud.

59:37.280 --> 59:41.160
Six months ago l was freezing
my ass off in the Ardennes.

59:41.160 --> 59:42.560
The good old days.

59:42.800 --> 59:46.640
When you could tell who the bad guy
was by who was shooting at you.

59:47.920 --> 59:50.080
Something on your mind?

59:51.440 --> 59:54.280
You're hiding someone
in a safe house in Kreuzberg.

59:54.480 --> 59:56.080
Who is it?

59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.080
Lieutenant Schaeffer should be
more careful about who follows him.

01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:03.200
l wouldn't blame Schaeffer.
His name was on the trip ticket.

01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:06.040
lt could be
l'm just a very attentive host.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:10.040
Either that, or you thought
l could lead you to Emil Brandt.

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.840
What do you think this peace conference
is really about, who gets Poland?

01:00:42.040 --> 01:00:45.560
The future. That's why everyone's
come to Potsdam.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.680
What do the next hundred years look like?

01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:51.520
All those V-2 rockets that hit London during the war.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.480
Well, you were there.

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:57.320
lf it lasted another year,
that would have been New York...

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:00.080
-...Chicago.
-What's this got to do...

01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:01.720
...with the peace conference?

01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:05.000
l thought you might have
recognized him.

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.520
Our friend in the safe house...

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.040
...is Franz Bettmann.

01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.080
The Russians get Poland...

01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.960
-...and we get the brains.
-ln a perfect world...

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:24.880
...doesn't a man like Franz Bettmann
wind up building rockets for our side?

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.040
But it's not a perfect world.

01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.360
lt doesn't surprise you
that there are those...

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:31.440
...who don't wish
America well, does it?

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.920
And Emil Brandt?

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.560
Brandt was Bettmann's secretary.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:41.520
Like a son to him. Bettmann
wants to bring him along to America.

01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:45.520
Awfully sentimental. Hundred thousand
marks for somebody's secretary?

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:49.200
All of them.
As many as we can track down.

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.240
Split-level with a Ford in the garage.

01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.800
Kids in the back yard
playing in the sprinklers.

01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.000
Strange if you wanted
anything different.

01:01:57.040 --> 01:01:59.200
Wives too.

01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:03.120
l wouldn't put too much stock
in that SS stuff.

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:08.120
When l was at West Point,
we put a uniform on a mule.

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:17.320
Look at these sleeves
and all this ruching.

01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.360
Nobody wears
anything like this anymore.

01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.840
l thought we weren't gonna reminisce.
Your rules. Not that we'd have time.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.960
-Why? What's going on?
-Why didn't you tell me Emil...

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:30.080
-...was with the rocket program?
-l didn't think it mattered.

01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.880
He worked directly under Bettmann
and it didn't matter?

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.960
-Who told you about Bettmann?
-Muller.

01:03:36.160 --> 01:03:38.120
They graduated
from the same polytechnic.

01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.120
That's why Bettmann hired him.

01:03:40.360 --> 01:03:41.800
Why did you talk to Muller?

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.760
He has Bettmann in a safe house,
on his way to America to make rockets.

01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:47.600
That's why they're looking for Emil.

01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:51.360
They're all going, including the wives.
Why didn't you tell me, Lena?

01:03:51.560 --> 01:03:54.200
-You know what Bettmann did.
-Everybody knows who he is.

01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:57.720
He was famous before the war.
Now, you can either tell me or Bernie.

01:03:57.920 --> 01:04:00.160
-He'll be here in two minutes.
-No.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.360
What was Tully selling that was worth
so much money? Some rocket secret?

01:04:04.560 --> 01:04:06.000
-No.
-Lena.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.600
-How the rockets were built.
-ls that what's in here?

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:10.120
How they were built?

01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.080
Lena, please.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:18.160
A factory inside a mountain.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:22.160
Tunnels where the American bombs
couldn't reach.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.000
What were once sulfur mines.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.160
Someone had to take them out.

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:29.640
Slave labor. Prisoners, detainees.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.000
That was how they built the rockets.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.040
Emil was asked to calculate
how much to feed them...

01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:39.800
...to keep them alive just three months
until the tunnels were completed.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.600
lt's here, in his notebooks.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.960
Eight hundred calories a day.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:51.840
After that, let them die
and bring in new workers.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:55.160
The correct answer, it turned out.

01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:57.040
lt was more efficient.

01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.440
They called it Dora. Camp Dora.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.960
Thirty thousand died in that camp.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.640
Bettmann ran it.

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.080
Every detail.

01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:15.800
He hanged people from a crane
right outside his office window.

01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:36.000
Take the back stairs. Find Danny
and tell him we have to move again.

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:37.840
And, Lena?

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.960
Make sure he knows
where l can find you.

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.120
She's playing you, Jake.

01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.080
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

01:05:57.160 --> 01:05:59.880
Muller paid Tully
1 00,000 marks for Emil Brandt...

01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:03.160
...because he worked for the rocket
program. One big happy family.

01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:05.280
They're all coming over|to our side now.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:08.040
Muller's hiding Franz Bettmann
in a safe house.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.080
Of course he is. The Russians
want them worse than we do.

01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.680
-They're kidnapping them.
-Not from the Russians...

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:16.520
...you dumb fucking cheesehead,
he's hiding him from you.

01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:19.080
They built the rockets
in concentration camps.

01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:22.080
Slave labor. Bettmann ran it.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:27.000
l don't wanna call
your girlfriend a liar.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.160
Let's just say l've met 1 2 people
who swear on their mother...

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:34.160
...they can deliver me Adolf Hitler
if l'll cut them a deal.

01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:38.000
Her husband was Bettmann's secretary.
l've seen the notebooks.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:42.600
Be honest with yourself
for a change, Jake.

01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:46.080
Has anything good happened
since you came back?

01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:23.080
Can l help you?

01:08:23.479 --> 01:08:25.000
A watch, perhaps?

01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:28.080
-No, thanks.
-How about a cigarette case?

01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.720
What happened to you?

01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:32.439
An experiment
to see if you can transplant...

01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.040
...a bone from one man into another.

01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:36.600
lt turns out you can't.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.840
-Always something worse.
-You can get such stories anywhere.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.479
l have plenty of those.
The Russians trade them for Lugers.

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.040
-No, thanks.
-How about a camera?

01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:53.000
Rolleiflex.

01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:57.080
The old ones used to turn the image
upside-down in the viewfinder.

01:08:57.279 --> 01:08:59.040
Little mirror sets it right.

01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:01.960
To set things right,
a thing to wish for.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.840
The woman who was just in here,
what did she want?

01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:09.160
Nothing. She bought nothing.

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:13.560
l know her. Lena Brandt.
l know she was here for a reason.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.319
Why?

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.000
Papers.

01:09:18.319 --> 01:09:21.160
She wanted papers
to get out of Germany.

01:09:21.359 --> 01:09:24.680
A Persilschein, like the soap.
That's what they call it.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:28.000
-To wash the sins away.
-Papers for who?

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:30.160
For herself.

01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.479
What did she do
that she has to wash away?

01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:38.720
Better to ask why l would help her.

01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:41.640
Me, with what l survived.

01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:47.000
l wanna know.

01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:03.120
At the Little White House in Potsdam...

01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:07.040
...Generalissimo Stalin of Russia is one
of the first to welcome the president.

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:11.080
As the meeting is recorded
by Signal Corps and newsreel cameras.

01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:17.840
Next to join the group
is Prime Minister Churchill...

01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:20.560
...who meets an old conference friend.

01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:27.000
The Big Three meetings are held in
Kaiser Wilhelm's former palace.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.160
And President Truman is selected
as chairman of the conference.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:34.040
Here, the fate of Germany and the end
of Japanese aggression will be settled.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.600
Under the flag
that flew over the White House...

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:40.840
...when we declared war on the Axis,
the president states our aims.

01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:45.240
We are here today
to raise the flag of victory...

01:10:45.440 --> 01:10:50.880
...over the capital
of our greatest adversary.

01:10:51.080 --> 01:10:55.760
Let's not forget
that we are fighting for peace...

01:10:56.200 --> 01:10:59.720
...and for the welfare of mankind.

01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:05.920
There's not one piece of territory,or one thing...

01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:08.880
...of a monetary nature
that we want out of this war.

01:11:09.080 --> 01:11:14.480
We want peace and prosperity
for the world as a whole.

01:11:14.680 --> 01:11:17.880
If we can put this
tremendous machine of ours...

01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:22.400
...which has made this victory possible,to work for peace...

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:26.760
...we can look forward to the greatest
age in the history of mankind.

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:09.120
They have a file on her.
l thought Bernie's golem broke into...

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:12.520
...her place looking for Emil,
but it was Lena they were looking for.

01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:16.120
That's why she had to get out.
Something she did during the war.

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:19.000
Tully wasn't killed in Potsdam,he was killed at Muller's.

01:12:19.240 --> 01:12:22.400
The body floated with the current.
lt didn't have to be someone...

01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:26.080
...with access to the conference.
The Russian gun? Get it at a pawnshop.

01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.880
-lt could have been anyone.
-Always something worse.

01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.520
-Did she ask you?
-What?

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:34.000
-To get her out of Berlin.
-She asked Tully.

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:37.160
You want my advice?
You'll forget all this.

01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.960
You'll only get hurt here.
Or hurt someone.

01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.360
-Where is she, Danny?
-Jake.

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:44.040
-Where is she, Danny?
-Jake.

01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:08.040
-Where are you going?
-l have someone to meet.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.960
-Who?
-Stop following me.

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.800
-What about the curfew?
-Life is inconvenient sometimes.

01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.480
-lt's not safe.
-And always, it seems not safe.

01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:17.960
-Who?
-Someone who can get me out of Berlin.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:20.160
-l'll go with you.
-No.

01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.400
Tully tried to get you out,
now he's dead.

01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:25.560
-Someone is waiting.
-Why is it so important for you to leave?

01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:28.400
-Please.
-What are you running away from?

01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:39.080
You should never have come back
to Berlin.

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:56.080
Why didn't Jake follow me?

01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.480
Why didn't he try?

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.120
He was scared.

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:05.080
Scared I'd really do it.

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.120
That I'd shoot him...

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.600
...just like Tully.

01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.680
All these men...

01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:15.080
...they want you to cry in their arms.

01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.960
I had no more tears.

01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:21.840
I knew what I had become.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.960
I had to kill Tully.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.120
He was getting
too close to the truth.

01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:31.320
Which was that the only way
out of Berlin for me...

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:34.280
...was to do one thing good.

01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:36.840
One thing noble.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.720
Otherwise,
Berlin would just follow me.

01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:46.000
A wife should help her husband.

01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.280
Isn't that noble?

01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.720
Isn't that good?

01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.280
Emil.

01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:57.240
l'll be candid. l'd think l'm the last
person you'd wanna contact.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.120
Sometimes people surprise you.

01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:03.160
Then your husband is alive?

01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:10.320
We're going to have to decide
to trust each other, Mrs. Brandt.

01:18:10.600 --> 01:18:13.920
To ask to meet me here
in the Russian sector is not a good start.

01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:16.160
l'm frightened.

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:19.680
That's not so difficult to understand.

01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:24.240
When our Gls liberated Camp Dora,
they found bodies stacked up in a room.

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.840
Stopped counting at a thousand.

01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:29.760
That was the first thing they found.

01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:33.200
There's nothing.
Nothing to link Bettmann to any of it.

01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:36.440
Not one sheet of paper,
not one witness.

01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:42.760
Your husband sat in
on every single meeting and took notes.

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:45.800
lf he were alive...

01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:49.000
...it would be extremely significant.

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:53.360
Yes. He's alive.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:55.440
He's a good German.

01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:58.000
He wants to tell the truth
about Camp Dora.

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:00.800
What is it you want, Mrs. Brandt?

01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:05.640
l want to get out of Berlin.

01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.040
Without my husband.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.720
Does he know that?

01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.480
No.

01:19:16.160 --> 01:19:19.160
lf l let you go,
l'm part of the same hypocrisy as Muller.

01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:21.120
But you'll do it.

01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.800
Bring him in. Bring your husband in.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:26.000
We'll talk about it.

01:19:27.920 --> 01:19:30.080
Why'd you leave the money on him?

01:19:30.680 --> 01:19:33.720
Tully. Did you panic?

01:19:33.920 --> 01:19:36.320
l don't know
what you're talking about.

01:19:42.800 --> 01:19:45.120
You sure you wouldn't be better off
staying put?

01:19:45.200 --> 01:19:47.240
l'm nervous
someone followed me here.

01:19:47.480 --> 01:19:50.040
l'm close, Danny,
really close to getting out.

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.320
That's when people get careless.

01:19:52.520 --> 01:19:56.160
Because you can trust Jake,
if that's who you're worried about.

01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:58.960
Have you got somewhere
you can put me?

01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.360
l've got a Kino
l bought in the French sector.

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:03.440
You know how they are about cinema.

01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:07.160
Matinee only until the curfew's lifted,
but it still turns a dollar.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:10.480
After that,
l'm fresh out of places to park you.

01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:18.920
l'm going to need some money
when l get to London.

01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:21.360
You got a john for me? A rich one?

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:25.160
l've got a bloke in the club
who'll give you a thousand marks.

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.480
Thinking about it?

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:32.160
When l met you,
you'd have a go for a can of tuna.

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:24.520
Hello?

01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:03.320
Don't let me interrupt you.

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:11.320
A thousand marks.

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:13.720
That's the deal, isn't it?

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:21.040
You want it straight
or something special?

01:22:21.040 --> 01:22:23.080
What's special?

01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:25.840
Whatever you want.

01:22:26.040 --> 01:22:29.280
-How did Tully like it?
-Rough.

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:35.480
You going to take off your clothes?

01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:41.080
You do it.

01:23:06.120 --> 01:23:07.840
Forget it.

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:11.400
You keep the money.

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.280
No. l want to.

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:21.120
l would have gotten you out.

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:24.560
l still would.

01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:30.720
You can never really get out of Berlin.

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:11.720
l followed you.

01:29:11.960 --> 01:29:14.080
lt's a good thing too.

01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.960
Go down to the Zoo Station.

01:29:17.160 --> 01:29:20.560
Find Danny and wait there until l get
enough money to get both of you out.

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.240
Pal, l'm the one sticking my neck out.

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:26.360
We're supposed to meet
Hauptmann Teitel.

01:29:28.160 --> 01:29:31.560
Do l have to draw a picture? Someone
got to him. Even Bernie they got to.

01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:47.520
Stand over there like you're waiting.
You answer the door.

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:04.760
Mrs. Brandt.

01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:07.040
And this must be the famous--

01:30:12.480 --> 01:30:14.000
Go!

01:30:57.680 --> 01:30:59.320
Help him.

01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:14.840
Go.

01:34:07.360 --> 01:34:09.480
How's your shoulder?

01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:17.120
The nurses are very kind.

01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:21.000
We were told that, if we found you,your husband would follow.

01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:23.400
That he was devoted to you.

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:26.120
Now l understand why.

01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:28.360
You're a lovely woman.

01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:31.680
Remind me of the gals back home.

01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.480
Schenectady.

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.760
You'd like it there.

01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:45.160
Lots of good German folk.

01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:47.720
The Sauerfleisch
would make you forget Berlin.

01:34:47.960 --> 01:34:51.400
Forgetting would be better
than the Sauerfleisch.

01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:55.200
Well, forgetting's a two-way street.

01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:59.040
There are things you wanna forget
and things we wanna forget.

01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:04.040
Where are your husband's documents,Mrs. Brandt?

01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.560
We can't seem to find them.

01:35:06.920 --> 01:35:10.520
Oh, they're not with my other things?

01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:12.920
You know they're not.

01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:17.000
l don't know,l can't remember anything.

01:35:18.040 --> 01:35:23.080
The medicine they've given me,it's making me feel all dizzy.

01:35:29.480 --> 01:35:32.040
Most important thing right now...

01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:35.400
...is for you to get well.

01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:41.200
Mrs. Brandt.

01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000
-What the hell are you doing here?
-Why, Mr. Geismer.

01:35:53.240 --> 01:35:57.000
lt's after visiting hours, but l guess
some people just can't follow the rules.

01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:59.160
Leave her alone. l mean it.

01:35:59.400 --> 01:36:02.240
l came here to make sure
she makes the right decision.

01:36:02.440 --> 01:36:04.040
You really wanna push me?

01:36:04.040 --> 01:36:05.840
l wouldn't.

01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:09.760
You don't have those documents,do you, Jake?

01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:17.600
You've seen what months of bombing
can do to a city.

01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:21.040
lmagine one bomb
could do the same thing.

01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:22.800
One bomb.

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:26.800
Stick it on the end of a rocket,
press a button here, goes off over there.

01:36:27.040 --> 01:36:29.120
Anywhere, halfway around the world.

01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:31.160
That's the future.

01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:33.280
The future of mankind's in our hands.

01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:36.960
lt's our destiny.
Hell, don't you read the papers?

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:10.000
-How'd you get in here?
-Who got to you? Was it Muller?

01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:12.920
-Do l need to call an MP?
-Not just yet.

01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:14.480
What's ''Overcast''?

01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:18.960
-Who told you about Overcast?
-ls it a code name?

01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:21.120
What's it got to do with Lena?

01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:25.680
Come on, Bernie, trot out one of your
atrocity stories to get me off your back.

01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:28.320
l had nothing to do with what happened
to Emil Brandt.

01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:30.880
You're the only one that knew
about me and Lena.

01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:32.360
So what? They got to me.

01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:35.560
Least l got something for it.

01:37:35.800 --> 01:37:40.320
l get to hang a half dozen Nazis
they wanted to just send to jail.

01:37:40.520 --> 01:37:42.920
Not like your girlfriend, though.

01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:47.000
She got everything she wanted,
didn't she?

01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:48.640
She's good at that.

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:53.200
Well, you can tell your boy Gunther
that he left one big, swinging loose end.

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:56.320
Lena doesn't have Emil's documents.

01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:58.400
l do.

01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:01.200
-Don't do it, Jake.
-l'll call you later for your quote.

01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:04.120
You never saw Lena's file, did you?

01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.000
Yeah. You get me those documents...

01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:11.160
...or l'll put her in jail
for the rest of her life.

01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:13.920
l have everything l need
and then some.

01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:16.920
Don't think l won't do it.

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:26.440
lf l give you those documents,
then she leaves with me.

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:30.040
-Breimer's already taken care of that.
-Not with Bettmann. With me.

01:38:30.040 --> 01:38:33.200
Anyplace she wants to go.
Anyplace l wanna take her.

01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:40.320
You've been wrong every step
of the way, Jake. Why stop now?

01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:45.840
What's in her file, Bernie?

01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:52.680
Why don't you ask her?

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:22.040
-You have your papers?
-They won't stop me. l'm with you.

01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:25.480
-Where are they?
-They're in my purse.

01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:27.760
There's something wrong.

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:31.360
Jake?

01:39:31.560 --> 01:39:35.320
Why was it so important
to get Emil out of Berlin?

01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:37.840
And why does Bernie
have a file on you?

01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:43.040
He had a file on everyone. l told you,
l was the wife of an SS man.

01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:46.120
Hitler put the rocket program
under the SS two years ago.

01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:49.840
That's what you told me. That as the
wife of an SS man, you were exempt.

01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:52.400
That's true. l told you the truth.

01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:55.800
How many Jews
were still in Germany in 1 943?

01:39:56.040 --> 01:40:00.040
By the time Emil could help you,
you should have been deported or dead.

01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.360
There were not so many.
You are right.

01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:12.760
So when they caught me,
l turned that to my advantage.

01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:16.720
l used the skills you taught me.
When l worked for you, for the newspaper.

01:40:16.920 --> 01:40:19.720
Watch, observe.

01:40:19.960 --> 01:40:21.840
The stupid risks they would take--

01:40:22.080 --> 01:40:26.240
Lunch at Aschinger's. 
--just to remind themselves they were still human.

01:40:29.960 --> 01:40:32.040
l found 12.

01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:38.600
l turned 12 people 
over to the Gestapo.

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.960
That's how l survived.

01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:43.120
lt was all to survive.

01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:45.080
Everything.

01:40:57.760 --> 01:40:59.840
Now you know.

01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:04.120
The last piece in your puzzle.
