00:23.160 --> 00:24.559
(door beeps)

00:26.360 --> 00:27.634
(door beeps)

00:28.520 --> 00:30.795
(sighs) Alright, come in!

00:34.320 --> 00:37.392
- Guinan, what's wrong?
- I need a doctor.

00:37.480 --> 00:41.029
Geordi beat me in straight sets.
I think I have tennis elbow.

00:41.520 --> 00:45.672
Well, you better go to sickbay.
I think Dr Selar's on duty.

00:45.760 --> 00:50.072
I don't want to see Dr Selar.
I'm particular about my doctors.

00:50.160 --> 00:53.948
You better get a new one. I'm not
a doctor on this ship any more.

01:23.880 --> 01:27.395
Space, the final frontier.

01:28.320 --> 01:32.199
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

01:32.280 --> 01:36.512
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

01:37.520 --> 01:40.956
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

01:41.960 --> 01:45.635
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

02:47.640 --> 02:51.918
A three-day shuttle to Starbase 23,
transport back to Earth.

02:52.000 --> 02:56.437
I can hear Admiral Brooks telling me
how I've disgraced Starfleet Medical.

02:56.520 --> 03:01.469
Then a day and a half before the
inquiry begins and my career ends.

03:02.440 --> 03:03.759
Beverly?

03:04.760 --> 03:07.558
- My elbow.
- Your elbow.

03:07.640 --> 03:09.631
Let me see it.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.313
Does this hurt?

03:12.400 --> 03:15.949
- Ow! Yes, right there.
- That's tennis elbow alright.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.395
Here, hold your arm like this.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.438
You know,
I've never been to a formal inquiry.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.795
I'll see if I can
arrange one for you!

03:23.880 --> 03:28.032
All you have to do is disobey orders,
violate medical ethics

03:28.120 --> 03:30.793
and cause an interstellar incident.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.632
I guess that would do it.

03:34.880 --> 03:36.677
Make a fist.

03:37.880 --> 03:41.350
Do I have to hit you with my fist
before you tell me what happened?

03:43.480 --> 03:46.438
It started when those scientists
came on board.

03:46.520 --> 03:49.830
No. It started when I got curious.

03:50.400 --> 03:51.992
Nothing wrong with that.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.799
That's why I went to
the Altine Conference.

03:54.880 --> 03:59.192
I'd heard of a subspace technology
developed by a Ferengi, a Dr Reyga.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.674
A Ferengi scientist. Hmm.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.354
His invention was based on
metaphasic fields,

04:05.440 --> 04:07.874
but his methodology
was most unorthodox.

04:07.960 --> 04:11.032
- I like unorthodox.
- Too bad you weren't there.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.031
Nobody else would listen to him.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.395
They all but jeered him
off the stage.

04:15.480 --> 04:18.711
But I had read his paper
and his work was extraordinary.

04:19.480 --> 04:23.951
So you gathered all these scientists
to come hear this Ferengi.

04:24.040 --> 04:26.713
Yes. I hoped
I could be a facilitator.

04:26.800 --> 04:30.270
I thought if I invited scientists
from various cultures,

04:30.360 --> 04:33.670
I could help them to understand
the value of his ideas.

04:34.040 --> 04:36.998
- Like a scientific diplomat.
- Exactly.

04:37.080 --> 04:40.868
After asking the Captain, I rounded
up as many scientists as I could

04:40.960 --> 04:43.713
from the field of
subspace technology.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.390
But of all the scientists I invited,

04:46.480 --> 04:50.393
only four were interested in
hearing about Dr Reyga's invention.

04:50.480 --> 04:54.519
And I wasn't altogether sure
they were going to be compatible.

04:54.600 --> 04:58.070
Kurak was a warp-field specialist
on the Klingon Homeworld.

04:58.160 --> 05:01.118
I don't think Klingons
regard scientists highly.

05:01.200 --> 05:04.237
She always seemed a little defensive.

05:04.800 --> 05:08.839
Dr T'Pan is practically a legend
in the field of subspace morphology.

05:08.920 --> 05:13.118
She's been Director of the Vulcan
Science Academy for 15 years.

05:13.200 --> 05:16.670
Her husband, Dr Christopher,
came with her.

05:16.760 --> 05:20.230
He was some kind of
subspace theoretician.

05:20.640 --> 05:24.315
Jo'Bril was a Takaran,
the first one I'd ever met.

05:24.400 --> 05:27.517
I had no idea
what to expect from him.

05:27.840 --> 05:31.594
And then there was Dr Reyga,
the Ferengi scientist.

05:31.680 --> 05:34.399
You've all seen
my experimental data.

05:34.480 --> 05:36.914
The metaphasic shield
has been proven.

05:37.000 --> 05:40.879
Forgive my scepticism, Doctor,
but your claims are extravagant.

05:40.960 --> 05:43.349
Protect a shuttle
within a star's corona?

05:43.440 --> 05:45.635
Not even your government believes it.

05:45.720 --> 05:48.712
That's why I've invited you all here.

05:48.800 --> 05:53.590
You have the vision to see the
potential of the metaphasic shield.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.035
I need help to develop the shield.

05:56.120 --> 06:00.477
I will grant exclusive rights
to whoever provides the resources.

06:00.560 --> 06:04.439
I think you all realize what this
shielding process could mean.

06:04.520 --> 06:08.035
The possibilities of exploration
and research are endless.

06:08.120 --> 06:10.111
But only if it works.

06:10.680 --> 06:14.116
I'm not convinced
this metaphasic shield can withstand

06:14.200 --> 06:17.476
the temperature or the radiation
it would be exposed to.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.757
But it has!
Not only in countless simulations,

06:20.840 --> 06:24.150
but in a field test
that I conducted myself.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.879
For which, of course,
we have only your word.

06:26.960 --> 06:30.191
Are you accusing me of
falsifying my data?

06:30.280 --> 06:35.195
You would not be the first scientist
to manipulate experimental data.

06:35.280 --> 06:39.068
Dr Reyga has offered
to demonstrate his invention.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.197
He's outfitted one of our shuttles
with his shield.

06:42.280 --> 06:44.919
I will take it into the corona
of the star Vaytan.

06:45.000 --> 06:49.630
That star has a dense corona and
would emit very intense radiation.

06:50.160 --> 06:53.152
It would be wise to choose
a star of lesser magnitude.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.514
I agree.

06:54.600 --> 07:00.391
My own research suggests Vaytan's
corona is extremely unstable.

07:00.760 --> 07:03.320
What better way to test my invention?

07:03.400 --> 07:06.631
I'm not concerned.
The shield will hold.

07:07.040 --> 07:11.079
I for one would feel more comfortable
if someone else flew the shuttle.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.832
Someone more objective.

07:12.920 --> 07:15.150
(Jo'Bril) I will volunteer for that.

07:15.720 --> 07:19.599
I've spent years studying
solar-plasma reactions.

07:19.680 --> 07:24.117
The thought of being able
to penetrate a star's corona.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.031
It is a remarkable opportunity.

07:26.840 --> 07:31.072
I've studied your data, Dr Reyga.
You're on solid scientific ground.

07:31.400 --> 07:36.520
I do not share your optimism,
but if you wish to pilot the craft,

07:36.600 --> 07:40.309
I would be more confident
in your assessment than Dr Reyga's.

07:40.400 --> 07:43.597
I agree.
We need an impartial evaluation.

07:43.680 --> 07:48.310
You'll have to know the controls
and Dr Reyga's modifications.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.073
I am an accomplished pilot.
It will be no problem.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.351
Well, what do you think?

07:55.520 --> 07:57.875
I am gratified, Dr Jo'Bril.

07:57.960 --> 08:01.475
It will not be difficult
to operate the metaphasic controls.

08:01.560 --> 08:05.553
The system activates automatically
as you approach the star.

08:05.640 --> 08:09.030
Well, then,
we'll proceed at 1500 hours.

08:09.120 --> 08:11.156
We'll meet on the bridge.

08:14.000 --> 08:18.516
It wasn't exactly an enthusiastic
response to Dr Reyga's technology,

08:18.600 --> 08:22.912
but given the circumstances
and the quarrelsome personalities,

08:23.000 --> 08:25.116
I was quite pleased.

08:25.200 --> 08:28.476
- I thought it went well. Didn't you?
- Thanks to you, Doctor.

08:28.560 --> 08:30.551
I didn't do anything.

08:34.720 --> 08:39.111
This is a chance I would never have
had without you. I won't forget it.

08:39.200 --> 08:43.477
Some of them still seem doubtful,
but I'm sure they'll come around.

08:43.559 --> 08:46.154
If I'm used to anything,
it's scepticism.

08:46.240 --> 08:50.677
After all, a Ferengi scientist
is almost a contradiction in terms.

08:50.760 --> 08:54.355
No, don't deny it.
I know how the Ferengi are regarded.

08:54.440 --> 08:58.513
I still expect the scientific
community to be a little more open.

08:58.600 --> 09:03.355
Well, the shield is a breakthrough.
Many have tried to develop it.

09:04.040 --> 09:07.669
It's only natural that
there would be some... resistance.

09:07.760 --> 09:09.671
You mean jealousy. I know.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.478
That might account
for Dr T'Pan's attitude.

09:13.560 --> 09:18.031
She's been working on that technology
for years and you beat her to it.

09:18.120 --> 09:20.315
I'm not interested in competition.

09:20.400 --> 09:25.269
All I want is to be acknowledged.
Respected as a scientist.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.749
This invention will finally do that.

09:28.720 --> 09:30.472
I figured the hard part was over.

09:30.560 --> 09:33.074
I'd stepped out on a limb
and it hadn't broken.

09:33.520 --> 09:37.069
Not bad for my first venture
into scientific diplomacy.

09:37.760 --> 09:40.593
Captain,
the shuttle has been launched.

09:40.680 --> 09:42.750
On screen. Open a channel.

09:44.600 --> 09:47.831
I am one million kilometers
from the star's corona.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.990
At three-quarters impulse,

09:50.080 --> 09:53.311
I should reach it
in approximately three minutes.

09:55.120 --> 09:57.759
The metaphasic shielding
has begun to form.

09:57.840 --> 10:01.150
External temperature
is 0.9 million Kelvins and rising.

10:01.480 --> 10:04.199
Radiation levels
are nearing 10,000 rads.

10:04.280 --> 10:07.511
- That shouldn't effect the shuttle.
- That's right.

10:07.600 --> 10:12.469
Cabin temperature is 21 degrees
and the radiation levels are normal.

10:12.560 --> 10:15.791
Wait. I'm reading elevated
neutrino levels in the cabin.

10:15.880 --> 10:19.429
Those are from the subspace field
around the shuttle.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.795
Well within acceptable parameters.

10:21.880 --> 10:26.032
Outside temperature rising rapidly.
1.7 million Kelvins.

10:26.120 --> 10:29.749
Temperature is still 21 degrees
and the shield is holding.

10:31.640 --> 10:34.632
350,000 kilometers and closing.

10:35.600 --> 10:41.038
This is incredible.
I am actually flying into a star!

10:41.120 --> 10:44.829
Congratulations, Doctor.
This is an amazing achievement.

10:51.200 --> 10:55.113
Radiation levels outside the shuttle
are nearing 14,000 rads.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.555
Cabin temperature is still normal.

10:57.640 --> 11:02.475
I am now engulfed in the corona.
It's astonishing.

11:04.200 --> 11:08.591
You see, Doctors?
Metaphasic shielding is a reality.

11:10.200 --> 11:14.398
Dr Jo'Bril, can you give us
an estimate of the plasma turbulence?

11:16.240 --> 11:17.992
- (gasps)
- Dr Jo'Bril?

11:18.080 --> 11:21.356
- Something's wrong.
- What's going on, Mr Data?

11:21.800 --> 11:25.156
Sensors indicate increased
baryon particles in the cabin.

11:25.240 --> 11:28.038
No! That's not possible.

11:28.880 --> 11:32.429
Dr Jo'Bril, can you hear me?
Please respond.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.991
(gasps)

11:36.520 --> 11:39.080
Baryon levels
are continuing to rise, sir.

11:41.400 --> 11:44.119
I don't understand.
This shouldn't happen!

11:44.200 --> 11:48.352
- Mr Worf, can you beam him out?
- The solar radiation is interfering.

11:48.440 --> 11:51.079
He must be
at least 500,000 kilometers

11:51.160 --> 11:54.869
from the star
before we can get a transporter lock.

11:56.720 --> 12:00.030
- We're losing him.
- Dr Jo'Bril, listen to me.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.429
It is imperative
that you turn the shuttle.

12:02.520 --> 12:06.672
Take it out of the corona.
Do you understand me?

12:06.760 --> 12:09.672
Pilot the shuttle away from the star.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.872
The shuttle is emerging.

12:19.960 --> 12:24.112
- Mr Worf, get a lock on him.
- Beam him directly to sickbay.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.397
At that point the doubts of
the others seemed justified.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.789
I had no idea what had gone wrong

12:30.880 --> 12:33.474
or how badly Dr Jo'Bril
had been injured,

12:33.560 --> 12:35.391
but I knew this could stop Reyga

12:35.480 --> 12:39.553
being accepted
by the scientific community.

12:41.480 --> 12:43.471
20cc inaprovaline.

12:46.240 --> 12:48.231
(laboured breathing)

12:51.200 --> 12:53.668
It's not working.
Cortical stimulators.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.558
Now.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.592
Again.

13:19.080 --> 13:23.153
I saw... the sun.

13:41.600 --> 13:45.036
So that was my first experience
as a scientific diplomat.

13:45.120 --> 13:47.111
A complete failure.

13:49.480 --> 13:52.358
- I don't understand.
- No?

13:52.840 --> 13:55.274
I mean, I've lost patients before.

13:55.640 --> 13:59.076
- But this was different.
- Hm-hmm.

14:00.000 --> 14:04.835
You know, when you're a doctor and
you have patients, you're in control.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.514
But when you send somebody
on a mission,

14:07.600 --> 14:09.397
all you can do is sit and watch.

14:11.360 --> 14:13.999
That's what I felt. Helpless.

14:14.080 --> 14:18.517
Anybody would.
Don't be too hard on yourself.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.870
What you say reminds me
of something Jean-Luc said to me

14:24.960 --> 14:27.872
when I was doing the autopsy
on Jo'Bril.

14:27.960 --> 14:32.715
It was the most puzzling autopsy
I've done, and the most frustrating.

14:32.800 --> 14:36.679
Jo'Bril's anatomy
was unlike any I'd encountered,

14:36.760 --> 14:39.991
and I've run into
some unusual specimens.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.991
How's it going?

14:42.080 --> 14:45.516
I've never run into
a humanoid species like this before.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.750
His internal physiology is baffling.

14:47.840 --> 14:50.308
He doesn't seem to have
any discrete organs,

14:50.400 --> 14:52.391
not in the traditional sense.

14:52.480 --> 14:56.439
Practically every system is equally
distributed throughout the body.

14:56.520 --> 15:00.593
That should make him
incredibly resistant to any injury.

15:00.680 --> 15:03.797
So whatever killed him
occurred at the cellular level.

15:04.600 --> 15:06.795
- Any idea what it was?
- No.

15:06.880 --> 15:11.351
Something caused a system-wide
failure, but I don't know what.

15:11.440 --> 15:15.035
Were the solar radiation levels
high enough to kill him?

15:15.120 --> 15:18.157
His exposure to the star's radiation
was minimal.

15:18.240 --> 15:19.832
It's all very strange.

15:20.240 --> 15:22.470
There's no apparent cause of death.

15:22.560 --> 15:26.314
Doctor, here's the result
of the tissue scan you asked for.

15:26.400 --> 15:30.996
That's odd. The rate
of cellular decay is extremely low.

15:33.960 --> 15:36.110
Beverly, the answers will come.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.760
Maybe even minimal exposure
to radiation

15:38.840 --> 15:41.149
altered the cellular physiology.

15:41.960 --> 15:44.520
You know,
you've been at this for hours.

15:44.600 --> 15:47.797
- You need a good night's sleep.
- I can't sleep.

15:47.880 --> 15:51.270
I want to find out what killed him.
I owe that to Dr Reyga.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.915
You're doing it for him or yourself?

15:55.800 --> 15:57.119
What do you mean?

15:57.200 --> 15:59.760
You're the loneliest person
in the world now.

15:59.840 --> 16:03.799
No one can say anything, no one
can do anything that will help.

16:03.880 --> 16:08.271
And you think it will never go away.
And you're right, it won't.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.152
But you can get used to it.

16:11.440 --> 16:15.991
I know it doesn't feel like that now,
but you can.

16:18.440 --> 16:21.318
At the time, I was too preoccupied
with my problems

16:21.400 --> 16:23.311
to understand what he was saying.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.868
I wasn't thinking
about the rest of my life.

16:25.960 --> 16:28.872
I was trying to make sense
of what had happened.

16:28.960 --> 16:30.837
And I wasn't alone.

16:30.920 --> 16:33.559
Jo'Bril's death
had raised a lot of questions.

16:33.640 --> 16:37.349
Geordi and Data were determined
to find out what had gone wrong.

16:37.440 --> 16:41.956
They went over every millimeter
of the shuttle, with Dr Reyga's help.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.637
Run a diagnostic
on the EPS flow regulator.

16:48.720 --> 16:51.280
The flow regulator
is functioning normally.

16:51.360 --> 16:54.193
And the fuel emitter?
Has it maintained polarity?

16:54.280 --> 16:55.235
Yes.

16:55.320 --> 16:59.598
- The radial-force compensator?
- I cannot locate any malfunctions.

16:59.680 --> 17:03.958
All systems are operating according
to your design specifications.

17:06.640 --> 17:08.392
- Did you find anything?
- No.

17:08.480 --> 17:11.153
There must be something
we've overlooked.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.356
I've found damage to the hull.

17:13.440 --> 17:16.954
That confirms your shield was
breached by baryonic radiation.

17:17.040 --> 17:19.679
Were the levels high enough
to damage tissue?

17:19.760 --> 17:20.909
I don't know.

17:21.000 --> 17:24.959
Perhaps there was an interaction
between the radiation and the shield.

17:25.040 --> 17:27.634
No, that's not possible!

17:28.280 --> 17:30.919
I anticipated every contingency.

17:31.000 --> 17:34.834
Then maybe Jo'Bril ran into something
which you didn't anticipate

17:34.920 --> 17:37.639
and your shield
just wasn't able to protect him.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.233
My shield was not at fault.

17:39.320 --> 17:43.711
Reyga seemed angry, but I knew it was
because he was so disappointed.

17:43.800 --> 17:47.554
Everything he'd worked for,
hoped for, was slipping away.

17:47.640 --> 17:51.474
And that made what I had to do next
even harder.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.430
In light of what happened,

17:54.520 --> 17:57.956
it would be inappropriate
to continue further testing.

17:58.040 --> 18:02.511
If Dr Reyga perfects his metaphasic
technology, we can try again.

18:02.600 --> 18:05.239
Dr Crusher, please.

18:05.320 --> 18:08.153
If I could have a little more time
to investigate,

18:08.240 --> 18:09.912
I could find what went wrong.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.434
But that won't bring back Jo'Bril,
will it?

18:12.520 --> 18:15.273
I do not believe the shield
will ever work.

18:15.360 --> 18:18.079
Its very concept is flawed.

18:19.680 --> 18:22.240
Just one more test.

18:22.320 --> 18:24.880
Whom do you propose
we sacrifice next?

18:26.120 --> 18:29.510
- I will pilot the shuttle myself.
- I'm sorry.

18:29.600 --> 18:34.116
I'm responsible for the health
and safety of all the people aboard.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.395
I will not authorize further tests.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.597
Very well.

18:40.680 --> 18:43.433
But I will prove myself!

18:45.000 --> 18:49.516
I had to admire his tenacity.
He just wouldn't accept defeat.

18:49.600 --> 18:52.034
I hoped he would prove himself.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.110
But that was the last time
I saw him alive.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.758
We were in science lab four

19:01.840 --> 19:05.958
when the ship's sensors registered
a sizable plasma surge there.

19:07.040 --> 19:09.395
Look at this. A plasma infuser.

19:09.480 --> 19:13.155
It's completely discharged.
It must have killed him instantly.

19:14.160 --> 19:18.597
Perhaps he could not live with
his failure and took his own life.

19:18.680 --> 19:22.229
Or perhaps someone
just wanted it to look that way.

19:22.320 --> 19:26.632
Isn't it odd he held on so tightly to
the infuser when it was discharged?

19:26.720 --> 19:29.439
The normal reflex
would be to drop it.

19:29.520 --> 19:31.909
It could have affected
his nervous system,

19:32.000 --> 19:33.911
causing him to grip tighter.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.195
I'll know when I do the autopsy.

19:37.560 --> 19:40.199
- Is your examination complete?
- For now.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.556
- Have his body taken to the morgue.
- Very well.

19:45.680 --> 19:48.558
I remembered his passion
and commitment

19:48.640 --> 19:51.108
and his determination
to prove himself,

19:51.200 --> 19:55.352
and I was sure that this man
had not taken his own life.

19:56.120 --> 20:00.079
If anyone could understand that,
I knew it would be Capt Picard.

20:01.840 --> 20:05.594
I was with him right before he died.
He was not suicidal.

20:06.480 --> 20:11.315
But by your own admission, Reyga
was a difficult man to understand.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.870
Isn't it possible that
he was simply masking his feelings?

20:14.960 --> 20:16.439
I don't think so.

20:16.520 --> 20:19.557
He was disappointed
at the failure of his device

20:19.640 --> 20:22.632
and he was upset at Jo'Bril's death,

20:22.720 --> 20:25.518
but I never felt
he was ready to end his own life.

20:25.600 --> 20:28.068
If that's true,
then someone killed him.

20:28.360 --> 20:31.796
- Do you have any evidence of that?
- Not yet.

20:31.880 --> 20:35.190
But when I finish the autopsy,
I hope I'll have it.

20:36.400 --> 20:37.992
Beverly.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.989
I'm afraid there will be no autopsy.
The family were contacted.

20:43.080 --> 20:47.153
They insist he must not be touched
until they perform the death ritual.

20:47.240 --> 20:49.754
But there's a question
as to how he died.

20:49.840 --> 20:52.513
- To them it's irrelevant.
- I'll speak to them.

20:52.600 --> 20:54.909
Believe me, they're adamant.

20:55.000 --> 20:58.356
We rendezvous with a Ferengi vessel
in 17 hours.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.670
They will pick up Reyga's body then.

21:00.760 --> 21:05.072
- Sorry. There will be no autopsy.
- Jean-Luc, I cannot just drop this.

21:05.160 --> 21:08.152
Don't you see?
There may have been a murder.

21:08.240 --> 21:12.358
Then you will have to find evidence
some way other than an autopsy.

21:21.480 --> 21:25.519
Isn't it pretty clear that Reyga died
from a plasma discharge?

21:25.600 --> 21:28.160
It won't be clear
until after an autopsy.

21:28.240 --> 21:29.878
He could have been poisoned

21:29.960 --> 21:32.713
and had the infuser
put in his hand after he died.

21:32.800 --> 21:35.951
- He was murdered?
- I don't discount the possibility.

21:36.040 --> 21:40.113
Without a complete autopsy,
there's no way to know for certain.

21:40.200 --> 21:43.715
- Why won't the Ferengi allow it?
- It's their death rituals.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.553
A body can't be violated
before it's buried.

21:46.640 --> 21:50.394
The family cares more about ritual
than finding out how he died.

21:51.200 --> 21:55.352
I just can't get the information
I need from a tricorder scan.

21:56.440 --> 22:00.592
Suspects. If Reyga didn't
kill himself, someone else did.

22:00.680 --> 22:02.910
So who are the possible suspects?

22:03.000 --> 22:05.036
Whoever would gain from his death.

22:05.120 --> 22:08.874
The only ones to fit that category
are the other scientists.

22:19.240 --> 22:24.314
I don't understand. Do you have
evidence that Reyga was murdered?

22:24.400 --> 22:26.994
No, but I can't believe
he took his own life

22:27.080 --> 22:29.753
and I would like to explore
any possibilities.

22:29.840 --> 22:31.876
Why would anyone kill him?

22:31.960 --> 22:35.589
I was wondering if you had
some thoughts along that line.

22:36.400 --> 22:40.678
I see. You are suggesting
that I had such a motive.

22:40.760 --> 22:43.115
Had Reyga's technology
been successful,

22:43.200 --> 22:47.352
you might have been displaced
as the top scientist in your field.

22:47.440 --> 22:52.150
But since it wasn't successful, it's
illogical to say I had such a motive.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.831
I must say I resent this, Doctor.

22:56.920 --> 22:59.275
We have all been shocked
by recent events.

22:59.360 --> 23:03.592
There's nothing to gain by dragging
us through these insinuations.

23:04.120 --> 23:08.113
I'm just trying to uncover the truth
and I need your help to do it.

23:08.200 --> 23:09.997
Have you seen or heard anything

23:10.080 --> 23:12.719
that might suggest someone else
had a motive?

23:12.800 --> 23:16.429
We want to forget the unpleasantness
of these past several days,

23:16.520 --> 23:18.795
not have it stirred up again.

23:18.880 --> 23:22.919
I find it disturbing that you would
try to foster suspicions among us.

23:23.000 --> 23:26.515
Forgive me.
I don't mean to upset you.

23:26.600 --> 23:28.909
But have you noticed
anything unusual?

23:29.000 --> 23:31.275
I find your question distasteful.

23:39.520 --> 23:42.080
Is there something
you're not telling me?

23:46.600 --> 23:48.591
I'm sure it's nothing.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.951
I was in the science-laboratory
store room yesterday.

23:54.040 --> 23:56.349
Kurak was working in the lab.

23:56.440 --> 24:01.514
Reyga came in
and they got into an... an argument.

24:02.720 --> 24:04.472
About what?

24:04.560 --> 24:06.232
I don't know.

24:06.320 --> 24:09.437
I couldn't hear anything clearly

24:09.520 --> 24:11.954
until they started to shout
at one another.

24:12.920 --> 24:16.595
Then I heard Kurak say
that Reyga had insulted her honor

24:16.680 --> 24:19.558
and no Klingon would stand for that.

24:19.640 --> 24:22.200
I do not believe she killed him.

24:22.280 --> 24:24.430
These were words spoken in anger.

24:25.160 --> 24:30.712
Kurak is volatile, passionate,
but not a killer.

24:33.520 --> 24:35.829
And, Doctor, neither are we.

24:37.800 --> 24:39.791
Thank you.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.669
I knew he might be right about Kurak.

24:42.760 --> 24:45.399
Klingons make threats
as a matter of course.

24:45.480 --> 24:49.189
On the other hand,
sometimes they follow through.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.868
That looks like one of Dr Reyga's
shield configurations.

25:01.960 --> 25:05.316
Yes. Personal research.

25:11.200 --> 25:13.839
Even though this technology failed?

25:14.320 --> 25:17.710
No one has denied
there is potential in the idea.

25:17.800 --> 25:19.756
Which you're now free to develop.

25:22.120 --> 25:24.759
Are you accusing me of something?

25:24.840 --> 25:28.833
No. But I want to know
why you threatened Dr Reyga.

25:30.440 --> 25:32.874
I warned Dr Reyga

25:32.960 --> 25:36.555
that if he persisted in his slander,
he would pay the price.

25:37.080 --> 25:39.355
What was his accusation?

25:40.240 --> 25:42.037
I will not repeat his lies.

25:42.520 --> 25:44.511
Were they lies?

25:46.720 --> 25:48.711
Be careful, Doctor.

25:49.960 --> 25:54.909
Insulting the honor of a Klingon
can be extremely dangerous.

25:55.760 --> 25:57.671
Did Reyga make that mistake?

26:01.400 --> 26:04.233
I have heard enough
of your accusations!

26:04.320 --> 26:07.551
Now I will have your silence!

26:10.680 --> 26:15.231
Well, you'll have to throw me
a lot harder than that.

26:15.320 --> 26:18.756
Now... what did he accuse you of?

26:22.120 --> 26:23.678
Sabotage.

26:23.760 --> 26:26.991
Of the metaphasic shield?
Was that why it failed?

26:27.080 --> 26:30.550
- How would I know?
- Did you sabotage the project?

26:34.120 --> 26:37.669
No. I did not.

26:44.560 --> 26:45.549
Goodbye, Doctor!

26:49.320 --> 26:52.153
Kurak refused to say anything more.

26:52.240 --> 26:55.437
I wasn't sure if her silence
was motivated by guilt

26:55.520 --> 26:57.795
or just Klingon pride.

26:57.880 --> 27:00.838
I was finding out
that investigating a murder

27:00.920 --> 27:04.196
was a little more perilous
than I'd thought.

27:04.280 --> 27:06.840
And for everything I'd been through,

27:06.920 --> 27:10.629
I didn't have any more insight
than I did before I started.

27:11.800 --> 27:14.314
Which brought me back
to Reyga's body.

27:14.400 --> 27:16.072
The more I thought about it,

27:16.160 --> 27:19.391
the more it seemed that
the answers had to be there.

27:19.480 --> 27:21.710
DNA traces, tissue anomalies,

27:21.800 --> 27:25.918
a wealth of forensic clues
that could shed light on the mystery.

27:26.000 --> 27:28.468
So I made the decision.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.314
(door beeps)

28:03.400 --> 28:04.992
Come.

28:06.440 --> 28:08.032
Beverly.

28:11.520 --> 28:15.877
This is something you need to know,
but you're not gonna like it.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.509
I did an autopsy on Dr Reyga.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.991
What did you find?

28:27.720 --> 28:29.711
Nothing.

28:31.640 --> 28:34.234
I'm sorry.
I know I shouldn't have done it.

28:34.680 --> 28:37.114
You most certainly should not.

28:37.200 --> 28:40.033
I made it clear
that the family would not allow it.

28:40.120 --> 28:42.350
Not only have you
disobeyed my orders,

28:42.440 --> 28:46.399
but you've interfered
in the rituals of another culture.

28:50.040 --> 28:52.838
You've put both of us
in a difficult position.

28:52.920 --> 28:54.911
The family will have to be notified.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.072
I don't doubt that
they will react strongly.

28:59.160 --> 29:03.756
If the Ferengi government becomes
involved, as I'm certain they will,

29:03.840 --> 29:07.116
this could have
very significant repercussions.

29:07.200 --> 29:09.873
I'm not sure
how much I can protect you.

29:10.800 --> 29:12.791
You don't have to, Jean-Luc.

29:14.360 --> 29:18.558
I knew what I was doing and I'm
prepared to accept the consequences.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.798
I could tell
he was terribly disappointed in me

29:26.880 --> 29:29.792
and that was almost
the hardest part of all.

29:29.880 --> 29:34.192
So that's the story.
That's how I ended my career.

29:36.360 --> 29:38.669
- Backhand volley.
- What?

29:38.760 --> 29:42.389
That's how I did it.
Geordi kept hitting to my backhand.

29:43.560 --> 29:47.758
Guinan, two people died on this ship,
two lives ended horribly,

29:47.840 --> 29:50.434
and you're worried about
your tennis game?

29:50.520 --> 29:52.636
- Are you upset?
- You tell me.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.109
You're supposed to be wise.

29:55.200 --> 29:59.398
If you are upset, why mope here?
Why don't you do something about it?

29:59.480 --> 30:02.631
I've done all I could think of.
It got me fired.

30:02.720 --> 30:06.395
- You think Dr Reyga killed himself?
- No.

30:06.480 --> 30:09.517
- You think a murderer is on board?
- Yes.

30:09.600 --> 30:14.276
- Then why are you sitting here?
- If I start digging around again...

30:14.360 --> 30:17.033
You could be relieved of duty.

30:25.400 --> 30:30.428
Chief Medical Officer's log,
personal, stardate 46830.1.

30:30.520 --> 30:34.069
I leave the ship tomorrow
to attend the board of inquiry.

30:34.160 --> 30:38.438
That means I have less than 24 hours
to get to the bottom of this mystery.

30:44.800 --> 30:46.552
What are you doing?

30:46.640 --> 30:48.232
I am running diagnostics

30:48.320 --> 30:53.110
to make sure there was no permanent
radiation damage to the shuttle hull.

30:53.800 --> 30:57.110
You've studied
Dr Reyga's shield system.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.350
Do you think it was sabotaged?

30:59.440 --> 31:01.795
There was no evidence
to support that.

31:01.880 --> 31:04.394
Just consider the possibility.

31:05.440 --> 31:09.718
Access to the circuitry is prevented
unless the shield emitter is active.

31:09.800 --> 31:13.679
Any attempt at sabotage had to be
made with the shield in operation.

31:14.200 --> 31:18.193
The only time the shield was active
was during the test flight.

31:18.280 --> 31:19.349
Correct.

31:19.440 --> 31:24.036
It is unlikely Jo'Bril would perform
sabotage resulting in his own death.

31:24.120 --> 31:26.031
I agree.

31:26.120 --> 31:31.240
Would it be possible to sabotage the
shuttle by remote during the flight?

31:31.320 --> 31:34.915
A phased ionic pulse
beamed into the metaphasic matrix

31:35.000 --> 31:38.231
would result
in a temporary system malfunction.

31:38.320 --> 31:41.118
Where on board
could you generate such a pulse?

31:41.200 --> 31:44.636
It could be initiated
from the lateral sensor array,

31:44.720 --> 31:49.316
science labs one, four and 16,
or the bridge science stations.

31:49.400 --> 31:52.551
Let's assume someone did send out
a phased ionic pulse.

31:52.640 --> 31:55.234
What would have happened
inside the shuttle?

31:55.320 --> 31:58.039
A tetryon field
would be formed in the cabin,

31:58.120 --> 32:00.395
disrupting the metaphasic shield.

32:01.760 --> 32:03.751
A tetryon field?

32:04.440 --> 32:07.113
If Jo'Bril was exposed
to a tetryon field,

32:07.200 --> 32:09.794
it might have left traces
in his tissue.

32:13.080 --> 32:15.071
Thanks, Data.

32:27.080 --> 32:29.469
- Beverly?
- Yes?

32:29.560 --> 32:32.358
The shuttle will take you
to Starbase 23.

32:32.440 --> 32:35.432
- You leave at 0700 hours tomorrow.
- Thank you.

32:35.520 --> 32:38.273
About everything that's going on.
I'm sorry.

32:38.360 --> 32:40.794
- I'm sure it will all work out.
- Of course.

32:40.880 --> 32:43.155
You know the inquiry
is just a formality.

32:43.240 --> 32:46.516
- Capt Picard will do all he can.
- I'm sure that'll help.

32:46.600 --> 32:50.195
But if you do anything foolish
before that, it won't look good.

32:50.280 --> 32:54.114
- I don't know what you mean.
- I think you do know what I mean.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.272
You ought to go to your quarters
and read a good book.

32:57.360 --> 33:01.069
If you make the situation worse,
it'll be that much harder on you.

33:01.160 --> 33:04.311
- Thank you. Your concern is noted.
- Beverly!

33:05.160 --> 33:07.720
I'm saying this to you as a friend.

33:07.800 --> 33:09.392
Yes, Will, I know.

33:09.480 --> 33:13.189
But, as a friend, please try to
understand that I can't quit now

33:13.280 --> 33:16.192
and I don't want you
to become involved in this.

33:23.720 --> 33:28.635
Computer, access ship's Medical logs
and download current autopsy files.

33:28.720 --> 33:32.395
Autopsy files are restricted to
active Medical personnel only.

33:32.480 --> 33:34.630
- Access denied.
- Damn!

33:34.720 --> 33:38.474
Dr Crusher? What do you need
the autopsy files for?

33:40.600 --> 33:44.912
Don't worry.
I know I shouldn't be here. I'll go.

33:50.360 --> 33:52.078
Computer...

33:53.400 --> 33:55.391
...access autopsy files.

33:56.160 --> 33:59.038
You'll need the files
on Dr Reyga and Jo'Bril?

33:59.120 --> 34:01.953
- Alyssa...
- I can see this is important to you.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.396
- I don't want you to get involved.
- Is that an order?

34:05.480 --> 34:08.949
- Yes.
- Too bad you're not my boss now.

34:09.800 --> 34:11.677
Thank you.

34:12.080 --> 34:15.311
- So what do we do now?
- Review the physiology records.

34:15.400 --> 34:18.949
Then look again at the body
to see if there's any tetryon traces.

34:19.040 --> 34:21.031
Let's do it.

34:36.679 --> 34:40.309
We need to run a tissue scan
at the molecular level.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.312
Calibrate the scanner
to pick up tetryon particles.

34:43.400 --> 34:45.550
Yes, Doctor.

34:45.639 --> 34:48.791
- Recalibration complete.
- Activate the scan.

34:54.040 --> 34:55.792
Nothing.

34:55.880 --> 34:57.393
Let's do it again.

34:57.480 --> 35:01.189
Use the enhanced resolution mode
to boost the sensitivity.

35:01.960 --> 35:05.999
- Something in the subdermal tissue.
- Narrow the scan field.

35:06.760 --> 35:07.988
(beeping)

35:08.680 --> 35:10.557
Tetryon traces!

35:11.040 --> 35:13.156
Someone did sabotage the shield.

35:13.240 --> 35:18.030
That's a possibility, but this
is very circumstantial evidence.

35:18.120 --> 35:20.634
There's only one way
to know for certain.

35:29.040 --> 35:32.555
Captain,
I'm concerned about Beverly.

35:32.640 --> 35:35.552
I've tried to talk to her
but she's been avoiding me.

35:35.640 --> 35:37.676
I'm not surprised.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.637
This experience has been...

35:39.720 --> 35:43.952
Captain. An unscheduled launch
is taking place in shuttlebay two.

35:48.240 --> 35:50.674
No idea.
No one's filed a flight plan.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.557
On screen.

35:56.480 --> 35:59.870
That's the Justman,
the shuttle Reyga modified.

35:59.960 --> 36:01.951
Open a hailing frequency.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.958
Dr Crusher,
what do you think you're doing?

36:10.040 --> 36:12.156
Testing a theory, Captain.

36:18.040 --> 36:19.155
A theory?

36:19.240 --> 36:21.515
I think Dr Reyga's shield does work.

36:23.080 --> 36:25.071
Return to the ship immediately.

36:25.760 --> 36:27.398
I'm sorry.

36:28.560 --> 36:31.358
Mr Worf,
override the shuttle's computer.

36:31.440 --> 36:33.431
Aye, sir.

36:34.120 --> 36:36.953
Sir, she has isolated
her navigational control.

36:37.040 --> 36:39.679
Remote operation is not possible.

36:39.760 --> 36:41.716
Get a tractor beam on her.

36:41.800 --> 36:46.271
I cannot establish a lock.
Solar interference is too high.

36:46.360 --> 36:49.875
- Mr Data, what is her heading?
- Bearing 271, mark four, sir.

36:49.960 --> 36:52.349
She is headed into the sun's corona.

36:56.760 --> 37:00.070
Computer, begin monitoring
external temperature.

37:00.160 --> 37:04.836
External temperature
0.8 million Kelvins and rising.

37:04.920 --> 37:06.876
What do you hope to accomplish?

37:06.960 --> 37:09.554
I think Dr Reyga was right
about his shield.

37:09.640 --> 37:13.030
It failed because it was sabotaged.
I'm going to prove it.

37:13.120 --> 37:17.193
You can't be certain. You're betting
your life on a hypothesis.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.431
I'm not wrong.

37:19.880 --> 37:23.839
(computer) External temperature
1.9 million Kelvins.

37:29.440 --> 37:31.954
Sir, the shuttle
is entering the corona.

37:33.520 --> 37:35.112
What's happening?

37:35.960 --> 37:37.234
I'm alright.

37:38.240 --> 37:42.392
- Computer? Shield status.
- Metaphasic shield holding.

37:42.480 --> 37:46.234
All systems within
normal operating parameters.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.992
Congratulations, Dr Reyga.
You did it.

37:50.720 --> 37:54.872
Captain, post Security guards around
the three visiting scientists.

37:54.960 --> 37:58.350
One of them is responsible
for sabotaging the first test.

37:58.440 --> 37:59.953
I think if we...

38:00.040 --> 38:02.031
(beeping)

38:02.720 --> 38:05.393
Sir, we have lost contact.

38:12.560 --> 38:15.836
Crusher to Enterprise.
I've lost you. Come in.

38:16.520 --> 38:18.954
Justman to Enterprise. Come in.

38:20.560 --> 38:22.551
Enterprise, do you hear me?

38:22.640 --> 38:24.835
They cannot hear you.

38:24.920 --> 38:29.118
- I have severed communications.
- How can you be alive?

38:29.200 --> 38:33.113
I'd think after your autopsy on me
you'd know the answer to that.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.591
The slow rate of cellular decay.

38:35.680 --> 38:39.150
It is a natural result
of physiostasis.

38:39.240 --> 38:42.835
Takarans can control their physiology
at a cellular level.

38:42.920 --> 38:45.275
We can create
the appearance of death.

38:45.360 --> 38:49.353
In the morgue, you were conscious.
You heard everything we said.

38:49.440 --> 38:51.715
You knew everything
we were going to do.

38:51.800 --> 38:53.870
Move away.

38:53.960 --> 38:55.951
Move away.

39:03.080 --> 39:04.354
What are you doing?

39:04.440 --> 39:07.876
I'm sending out
a transient subspace signal.

39:07.960 --> 39:11.157
It will obscure the shuttle
from the Enterprise sensors.

39:11.240 --> 39:14.277
They will interpret it
as a warp-engine breach.

39:14.360 --> 39:17.238
They will believe
that you have been destroyed.

39:17.760 --> 39:20.593
- I'd like to thank you, Doctor.
- For what?

39:20.680 --> 39:23.114
All I wanted to do
was discredit Reyga

39:23.200 --> 39:27.193
so that no one would pursue
his technology except me.

39:27.280 --> 39:31.398
But you have given me
more than I could have hoped.

39:31.480 --> 39:35.234
Now I can take the prototype itself
back to Takara,

39:35.320 --> 39:37.788
where I will develop it
into a weapon.

39:38.600 --> 39:41.319
All I need do is wait here

39:41.400 --> 39:45.837
until the Enterprise is convinced
you are dead and leaves.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.639
Captain, there is no
indication of debris.

40:32.720 --> 40:36.872
However, the subspace signal
indicates a warp-engine breach.

40:36.960 --> 40:41.158
Begin a search, starting with
the shuttle's last known coordinates.

40:41.240 --> 40:42.912
Plot a course toward the star.

40:43.000 --> 40:46.595
Sir, we are picking up an object
emerging from the corona.

40:51.920 --> 40:56.755
Crusher to Enterprise.
I'm alright. Returning to the ship.

40:56.840 --> 41:00.435
And I finally have the answers
I've been looking for.

41:02.440 --> 41:06.592
Chief Medical Officer's log,
stardate 46831.2.

41:06.680 --> 41:10.355
I have been reinstated
and I will resume my duties shortly.

41:10.440 --> 41:15.275
In the meantime, I have
a personal matter to attend to.

41:15.360 --> 41:19.069
- Hi, Guinan.
- Hello. Somebody's birthday?

41:19.160 --> 41:21.276
Not unless it's yours. It's for you.

41:21.360 --> 41:22.952
What's the occasion?

41:23.040 --> 41:25.952
It's a thank-you.
For giving me a kick in the butt.

41:26.520 --> 41:27.999
Now, I didn't...

41:28.080 --> 41:31.914
I did some research. This is
the latest design, state of the art.

41:32.000 --> 41:35.436
It is specifically designed
to cushion all vibrations,

41:35.520 --> 41:38.159
so you will never have
tennis elbow again.

41:40.760 --> 41:42.159
Thank you, Doctor.

41:42.240 --> 41:48.793
This looks like a great racket,
but I don't play tennis. Never have.
