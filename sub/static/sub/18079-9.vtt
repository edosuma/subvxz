01:24.684 --> 01:26.447
(Chin)
You're late, Rajiv.

01:27.587 --> 01:29.680
(Rajiv)
There were things
to take care of.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.156
(Lin Wu)
We are very pleased...

01:36.229 --> 01:37.821
you came through for us,
Rajiv.

01:37.897 --> 01:41.663
Let us hope this is
the beginning of a long
and profitable arrangement.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.996
[grunting in pain]
Are you all right?

01:46.072 --> 01:48.632
(Rajiv)
I'm not feeling well.
I've had little sleep.

01:48.808 --> 01:50.469
We have another job
for you.

01:50.543 --> 01:53.637
There'll be no other job.
I'll be content
with what you pay me now.

01:53.713 --> 01:55.180
(Lin Wu)
You don't get paid now.

01:55.582 --> 01:57.072
[footsteps approaching]

02:01.154 --> 02:02.280
Hi, guys.

02:02.355 --> 02:03.583
[gun clicking]

02:03.656 --> 02:04.748
Here.

02:06.693 --> 02:09.025
[gun firing]

02:29.482 --> 02:31.177
Empress Seven to Mama Bear.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.048
Code Orange.
Repeat, Code Orange.

02:35.388 --> 02:37.481
36 hours to match point.

02:48.234 --> 02:49.326
[ringing]

02:52.272 --> 02:53.398
Yes.

02:53.473 --> 02:55.532
Colonel Smith managed
to get a message through.

02:55.608 --> 02:58.304
36 hours to match point.
Code Orange.

02:58.511 --> 03:01.674
I see.
And the Colonel's status?
No verification.

03:01.981 --> 03:06.008
All right,
shift red sector plan one day
and meet me in Langley.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.849
[gun firing]

04:49.822 --> 04:52.484
(Face)
Boy, Stockwell, this one
really takes the cake.

04:52.558 --> 04:54.822
It was a stupid idea
in the first place.

04:54.894 --> 04:56.452
I told you it wouldn't work.

04:56.629 --> 04:59.530
And now you tell us
that you don't even know
where Hannibal is.

04:59.599 --> 05:01.794
What about
all these backup people
you were supposed to have?

05:01.868 --> 05:03.267
Weren't they able
to tell you anything?

05:03.336 --> 05:05.634
Yeah. Aren't there supposed
to be contingency plans...

05:05.705 --> 05:07.070
when something
like this happens?

05:07.140 --> 05:09.438
We simply don't have
complete information
at this time.

05:09.509 --> 05:10.703
Give us a break.

05:10.777 --> 05:13.644
Come on, Carla, you know
how this ship operates.

05:13.713 --> 05:16.841
The two of you,
you never give us
all the information you have.

05:16.916 --> 05:19.646
Only this time,
we're talking about
the Colonel's life.

05:20.186 --> 05:23.587
So a little information
isn't enough.

05:29.429 --> 05:31.693
All right.
Colonel Smith was undercover.

05:32.198 --> 05:33.688
He was tracking
a cache of plutonium...

05:33.766 --> 05:36.200
that was stolen last week
from a nuclear facility
in lndia.

05:36.269 --> 05:38.066
The last message
we had from him indicated...

05:38.137 --> 05:40.935
that he had discovered
a vital piece of information.

05:41.741 --> 05:44.869
He advanced the mission
to Code Orange,
an extreme emergency...

05:44.944 --> 05:48.209
and started the clock.
36 hours to match point.

05:48.281 --> 05:49.441
As you know...

05:49.515 --> 05:52.245
plutonium is
the essential element
in any nuclear weapon.

05:52.719 --> 05:54.880
We must consider
the possibilities
if it were...

05:54.954 --> 05:57.252
to fall into the hands
of a lunatic terrorist group--

05:57.323 --> 06:00.383
Look. We know how serious
the situation is, General.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.894
What we want to know is
what has happened
to Hannibal?

06:02.962 --> 06:05.021
We've had no further contact
from Colonel Smith...

06:05.565 --> 06:07.795
or our other operative
Alice Heath.

06:09.001 --> 06:10.468
So at this point...

06:11.671 --> 06:14.071
we must assume
that the network...

06:15.742 --> 06:17.004
has been terminated.

06:17.076 --> 06:18.703
What kind of operation
is this?

06:18.778 --> 06:21.975
Nobody knows where anyone is,
who anyone is.

06:22.849 --> 06:26.114
Johnny has his own methods.
He's probably fine.

06:26.586 --> 06:28.076
Yeah, well,
we're gonna go get him.

06:28.154 --> 06:30.019
No, we are not
going to do anything.

06:30.089 --> 06:32.080
I'm going to do
the follow-up personally.

06:32.158 --> 06:35.616
Personally?
When was the last time
you did anything personally?

06:36.262 --> 06:39.197
General Stockwell was
an operative in Hong Kong
for many years.

06:39.265 --> 06:41.825
Nobody knows the territory
as well as he does.

06:42.001 --> 06:44.595
Yeah.
But we're going after Johnny.

06:44.737 --> 06:47.205
You're all
confined to quarters
until further notice.

06:47.273 --> 06:50.140
Well, if you want to enforce
that order, General...

06:50.343 --> 06:53.005
you better seriously think
about terminating us.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.479
Hey, man, this time
we're gonna do it my way.

07:19.305 --> 07:20.431
[honking]

08:08.521 --> 08:10.512
Check us in.
The name is Robins.

08:11.691 --> 08:13.386
Come on, Murdock,
let's go.

08:13.459 --> 08:16.087
Hey, where you guys going?
What's happening?

08:16.162 --> 08:18.187
Well, if you're
in a strange town...

08:18.264 --> 08:20.698
and you need
to find somebody,
who do you ask?

08:20.766 --> 08:22.131
Cab driver.

08:22.301 --> 08:25.702
Yeah, but Stockwell
said to stay right here
and check in.

08:25.771 --> 08:29.332
Well, that's great.
That's great. You just
do that. That's great.

08:30.309 --> 08:31.367
Come on.

08:32.912 --> 08:35.506
If these guys
stand around here
all day...

08:35.581 --> 08:39.142
one of them had
to see Hannibal
leave the hotel.

08:39.485 --> 08:40.611
That one.

08:41.754 --> 08:42.914
See this man?

08:48.928 --> 08:50.555
You see this man?

08:51.931 --> 08:54.422
He certainly doesn't seem
to have made an impression
on anybody.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.127
You don't think
he's a bad tipper,
do you?

08:56.202 --> 08:57.499
Here.

08:57.837 --> 08:59.304
The tide is rising.

09:05.878 --> 09:07.846
Have you seen this guy?

09:07.947 --> 09:10.006
Yes. Maybe so.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.986
Ah! It's beginning
to come to me now.

09:21.594 --> 09:25.086
Yes.
Maybe two, three days ago.

09:25.197 --> 09:27.688
And where,
where did you take him?
Do you remember?

09:28.067 --> 09:29.694
Oh, I don't know.

09:34.774 --> 09:36.935
So many people to remember.

09:40.947 --> 09:42.744
And that's it.
All right?

09:45.017 --> 09:46.575
As a grandfather saying...

09:46.652 --> 09:49.678
"Like wilting rose in field,
I am the chosen one."

09:49.755 --> 09:52.451
Terrific.
Now where did you take him?

09:53.459 --> 09:56.860
I will give you
class A deluxe tour.

09:56.929 --> 10:00.695
To tell you the truth,
amigo, we're in
a bit of rush for time.

10:01.701 --> 10:05.364
Time is like
empty bottle of wine.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.871
Only good when filled.

10:07.173 --> 10:08.265
[scoffs]

10:09.542 --> 10:11.476
[Bobby whistling]

10:19.819 --> 10:22.413
[Fong and Stockwell
speaking Chinese]

10:25.858 --> 10:29.021
What have you found out?
Your man Benson
was in room 314.

10:29.095 --> 10:31.256
It has been untouched
since you called.

10:31.330 --> 10:32.592
Benson made
two phone calls.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.656
One to the States
when he arrived.

10:34.734 --> 10:36.793
We were unable
to confirm the number.

10:36.869 --> 10:38.666
The second was
to a local residence.

10:38.738 --> 10:40.535
How many of our men
are still in place?

10:40.606 --> 10:42.096
(Fong)
Quang Tai is dead.

10:42.174 --> 10:44.404
Chung Loo has
returned to Peking.

10:44.577 --> 10:46.977
The others I have to check.
It may take some time.

10:47.046 --> 10:49.640
Time is one thing
I can't give right now.

10:49.715 --> 10:52.582
It must be big
to bring you back
after all these years.

10:52.652 --> 10:56.247
You'll be informed
on a need-to-know basis
as before.

10:56.455 --> 10:59.822
You have not changed, Major.
General.

11:00.693 --> 11:02.718
I see no need to change.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.330
Where are Peck
and Murdock?

11:16.409 --> 11:19.310
Well, Face.
He saw a woman...

11:19.378 --> 11:22.779
that he knows.
And Murdock, he saw....

11:22.848 --> 11:25.373
Something in his head.
Ain't no telling
what it was.

11:25.451 --> 11:28.420
I believe my instructions
to stand by were quite clear.

11:28.487 --> 11:30.955
Well, you know
how impulsive
boys can be.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.018
All right.
I'll deal with them later.
We've got things to do.

11:34.093 --> 11:36.755
Where are we going?
Colonel Smith's room.

11:58.517 --> 12:00.849
(Frankie)
Johnny never kept his room
like this at home.

12:00.920 --> 12:02.911
How are we gonna
find clues in this mess?

12:02.988 --> 12:04.979
If anybody hurt him,
they're gonna pay.

12:05.057 --> 12:06.547
All right,
check everything.

12:11.964 --> 12:13.090
[metallic rattling]

12:15.568 --> 12:16.830
Psst, B.A.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.566
[sighs]

12:29.248 --> 12:30.977
[sighing in relief]

12:31.617 --> 12:35.917
Oh, man!
It's just Hannibal's
designer collection.

12:36.989 --> 12:38.081
General...

12:38.157 --> 12:40.421
[gun cocking]
I think
I found my first clue.

12:48.601 --> 12:49.966
[speaking Chinese]

12:50.069 --> 12:51.934
[speaking Chinese]

12:52.605 --> 12:55.039
Gentlemen,
meet Alice Heath.

12:55.674 --> 12:56.766
Johnny's contact?

13:00.012 --> 13:01.240
We thought you were dead.

13:01.313 --> 13:03.338
Where's Hannibal?
I don't know.

13:03.649 --> 13:05.583
He called yesterday
and asked me to check...

13:05.651 --> 13:08.279
points of entry
for an lndian named Rajiv.

13:08.354 --> 13:11.289
We scheduled to meet
a few hours later.
He didn't show.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.917
I tried to reach him here,
but wasn't successful.

13:13.993 --> 13:15.460
Why haven't you reported in?

13:15.528 --> 13:18.224
Security had been breached
with Colonel Smith missing.

13:18.297 --> 13:20.857
I wasn't sure if the codes
were still protected.

13:20.933 --> 13:24.528
So I came here to see
if I could find any clues
to his whereabouts.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.999
(Stockwell)
All right. Continue
looking for Rajiv.

13:27.072 --> 13:30.439
According to our last contact
with Colonel Smith,
we have only...

13:30.743 --> 13:32.438
22 hours left till delivery.

13:33.846 --> 13:37.304
And Johnny sure got himself
in a big kettle this time.

13:37.383 --> 13:41.547
Sometimes size of fish
not important,
size of hunger is.

13:41.687 --> 13:44.087
(Face)
If this kid quotes his
grandfather one more time...

13:44.156 --> 13:45.316
you know, I'm gonna--
Bobby!

13:45.391 --> 13:47.882
Bobby,
are we getting any closer
to where you took our friend?

13:47.960 --> 13:49.587
Yes. Very close.

13:50.095 --> 13:52.791
The road is long
with many a winding turn.

13:53.032 --> 13:55.592
Yeah, well, we heard
that one before, Bobby.

14:06.979 --> 14:08.503
We got company.

14:23.529 --> 14:27.056
So, honorable friend
go to that camera store.

14:27.132 --> 14:29.066
He say he want
to buy stuff.

14:30.336 --> 14:33.305
So, please enjoy
honorable city.
Bobby must go now.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.170
Listen, Bugsy, stick around,
introduce us to your friend.

14:36.242 --> 14:38.403
Forget that, Jack.
I'm out of here, man.

14:38.477 --> 14:42.072
On break, taking a leave.
I'm history, man.
Bonzai, babes.

15:06.672 --> 15:08.697
At least that takes care
of one of them. Now what?

15:08.774 --> 15:10.765
What would the Colonel do
if he was here now?

15:10.843 --> 15:13.038
[panting]
I know.
You slime ball!

15:13.812 --> 15:14.972
All right.

15:15.347 --> 15:17.315
You got 10 seconds
to tell us what you know.

15:17.383 --> 15:18.816
I will tell you nothing.

15:19.785 --> 15:21.082
It didn't work.

15:21.387 --> 15:24.117
Well,
that's because you....
You didn't do this.

15:24.857 --> 15:27.257
All right.
What happened to this man?

15:28.127 --> 15:30.391
This man?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where is he?

15:31.130 --> 15:32.290
This man is dead.

15:40.239 --> 15:41.433
(Stockwell)
Wake him.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.472
[speaking Chinese]

15:58.490 --> 16:01.084
I guess he must be
more afraid of someone else
than he is of us.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.628
I think I recognize
this man, General.

16:03.696 --> 16:07.393
He looks like a man
I've seen working as a bouncer
at Hop Louie's.

16:07.666 --> 16:10.328
Interesting. Maybe we are
making some progress.

16:15.341 --> 16:17.605
(Stockwell)
What do you know
about the plutonium?

16:18.277 --> 16:20.370
What happened
to Colonel Smith's body?

16:20.446 --> 16:23.040
I've always
thought of Johnny
as some kind of a...

16:23.649 --> 16:26.083
superman, you know.
There ain't no body.

16:26.185 --> 16:28.210
Are you working
for Byron Chin?

16:28.287 --> 16:29.720
They don't always
find a body, B.A.

16:29.788 --> 16:32.018
(Murdock)
Hey, Frankie, do you know
something we don't know?

16:32.091 --> 16:34.457
Why are you trying so hard
to convince us
that Hannibal's dead?

16:34.526 --> 16:35.584
I'm not!

16:36.528 --> 16:38.052
Just trying
to face facts.

16:39.231 --> 16:42.792
Everything we've heard
so far says that
Johnny is not alive.

16:42.868 --> 16:46.736
Frankie, there's not
one shred of hard evidence
that says he's dead.

16:46.805 --> 16:49.296
Yeah, except that goon
back there who says
he was killed.

16:49.375 --> 16:51.639
Well, you shouldn't be
listening to goons!

16:54.847 --> 16:56.940
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

16:58.984 --> 17:02.647
It's just that goons are
not a very reliable source
of information, you know.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.346
Yeah, see the bottom line
here, Frankie, is...

17:05.424 --> 17:08.915
we're not gonna believe
Hannibal is dead
until we get some proof.

17:09.261 --> 17:11.957
If there's no body,
Hannibal is alive.

17:13.999 --> 17:17.594
I think the key to this
whole mess is Bobby.

17:17.669 --> 17:19.102
That little pedicab pedaller.

17:19.171 --> 17:21.765
Yeah, how come
you haven't let Stockwell
in on that one?

17:21.839 --> 17:23.068
Stockwell?

17:23.142 --> 17:27.203
Stockwell doesn't give
a rat's tail whether
Hannibal is alive or dead.

17:27.579 --> 17:29.137
You got that right,
crazy man.

17:30.215 --> 17:33.446
All right, we're upgrading
the status of this mission
to Code Red.

17:34.019 --> 17:35.646
Now, according to
Colonel Smith's message...

17:35.721 --> 17:38.656
we've got 16 hours
before the plutonium shipment
changes hands.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.453
I have arranged for
our friend back there...

17:40.526 --> 17:42.050
to be picked up here
in half an hour.

17:42.127 --> 17:43.594
So I want you
to stay here until then.

17:43.662 --> 17:46.893
B.A. and Frankie will
cover this end here for you.

17:46.965 --> 17:48.865
Murdock and I have something
we got to check out.

17:48.934 --> 17:52.131
No, you're not
checking anything out till
the prisoner is picked up.

17:52.204 --> 17:55.605
And I want you to meet
Alice and me at Hop Louie's.
Understood?

18:03.415 --> 18:04.780
Is there a problem?

18:05.551 --> 18:09.317
Yes. I do not believe that
Hannibal is dead, General.

18:09.788 --> 18:13.155
That's an interesting fantasy.
But we don't deal in fantasy
in this business.

18:13.225 --> 18:15.750
Fantasy?
Wait just a minute
here.

18:16.195 --> 18:18.663
This situation
is no fantasy!

18:22.868 --> 18:25.894
All right. Perhaps that was
the wrong choice of words.

18:27.339 --> 18:30.934
No commander rests easily
when one of his men
has fallen.

18:31.009 --> 18:32.533
But men do die!

18:33.045 --> 18:34.842
Colonel Smith
understood that.

18:35.047 --> 18:36.912
He took that responsibility.

18:39.451 --> 18:42.045
Now we've got
15 hours and 58 minutes
to find the plutonium...

18:42.121 --> 18:44.612
or it won't matter
whether Hannibal Smith
is alive or dead.

18:44.690 --> 18:47.750
The only thing
that will matter is
whether he died in vain.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.326
Now, you went against
my instructions...

18:54.399 --> 18:56.390
and got involved
in this pedicab mess.

18:56.468 --> 18:57.901
They tied to kill you.

18:57.970 --> 19:01.167
Obviously our cover was blown
the minute you stepped
in the hotel.

19:10.382 --> 19:11.906
Face saw a girl.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.176
And Murdock saw
something in his head.

19:18.524 --> 19:20.082
(Murdock)
See, I told you
he'd be running.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.524
He's not gonna
want to talk to us.

19:21.593 --> 19:23.493
I disagree, Murdock.
Once I get through
with him...

19:23.562 --> 19:25.427
he won't be able
to talk fast enough.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.268
Excuse me. We're looking
for a little driver
named Bobby.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.634
A little Chinese guy.
Talks about
his grandfather a lot.

19:33.705 --> 19:36.435
Yes, yes.
What did he take you for?
A ride.

19:36.975 --> 19:39.808
Actually, see, we're looking
for a little action...

19:39.878 --> 19:42.142
and we were told that...

19:42.214 --> 19:44.114
you were the man to talk to.

19:44.416 --> 19:46.646
I have an idea
where we can do some business.

19:46.718 --> 19:49.653
Somewhere I take
all my customers of quality.

19:49.721 --> 19:50.881
Hop in, boys.

19:59.731 --> 20:04.031
How can a guy
who pedals around all day
be so large?

20:07.906 --> 20:08.895
(Albert)
Here we are.

20:08.974 --> 20:10.737
There's a gambling club
in this pastry shop...

20:10.809 --> 20:12.606
that I take
all my customers to.

20:12.678 --> 20:14.441
Bobby is a bit of
a regular here.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.038
Listen, can you
get us in?

20:18.383 --> 20:19.714
Getting in is easy.

20:19.785 --> 20:21.946
Getting out
with your shirt
is the challenge.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.977
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,
my inscrutable little friend.

20:50.048 --> 20:52.141
You have
some talking to do.

20:53.752 --> 20:55.014
These are the Colonel's
dog tags.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.577
(Bobby)
He gave them to me.
I swear.

20:56.655 --> 20:59.818
He said he couldn't trust
anyone else in Hong Kong.
Please don't hurt me.

20:59.891 --> 21:02.792
And what else
did he tell you?
Well, he said...

21:02.861 --> 21:04.556
he was out of touch
with everyone else...

21:04.630 --> 21:06.689
and he said if you guys
showed up, I should--

21:06.765 --> 21:09.996
That doesn't make sense.
Colonel already had
a contact with Alice....

21:12.170 --> 21:15.333
If he didn't trust anybody
in Hong Kong, that means
he didn't trust Alice.

21:15.407 --> 21:17.773
Wait a minute.
Isn't Stockwell meeting
with her right now?

21:17.843 --> 21:18.867
Yeah.

21:21.513 --> 21:23.310
##[Oriental instrumental
music playing]

21:23.382 --> 21:25.475
Good evening.
Reservation for Stockwell.

21:42.567 --> 21:43.591
Thank you.

21:43.669 --> 21:46.001
I'd like to see Mr. Chin,
please.

22:04.289 --> 22:07.520
Hunt Stockwell.
After all these years.

22:08.393 --> 22:10.452
Byron Chin,
this is Alice Heath.

22:10.529 --> 22:12.019
Byron runs
this establishment...

22:12.097 --> 22:14.361
along with
a few of the patrons.

22:14.466 --> 22:16.525
You must be thinking
of someone else.

22:16.702 --> 22:20.399
I follow the law implicitly.

22:21.573 --> 22:25.509
So, what brings you
back to my little club
after 20 years?

22:25.911 --> 22:27.572
The food. You know how it is.

22:27.646 --> 22:29.705
Two decades later,
you get hungry again.

22:49.401 --> 22:52.802
Would you mind
if we speak privately
for a moment?

22:53.939 --> 22:55.839
Not at all.
Excuse me.

23:18.764 --> 23:21.062
You know I'm looking
for Colonel Smith, right?

23:21.366 --> 23:23.231
How would I know
such a thing?

23:23.301 --> 23:25.132
Don't play games
with me, Chin.

23:25.637 --> 23:27.628
We caught your goon
and he sang like a bird.

23:27.706 --> 23:29.606
He told us that
you're holding Smith...

23:29.674 --> 23:31.107
and the plutonium.

23:31.710 --> 23:32.734
He did?

23:33.945 --> 23:36.505
I'm certain
he was confused.

23:38.683 --> 23:41.777
A pleasure seeing you again,
General.

23:49.394 --> 23:50.861
[man yelling in pain]

23:54.199 --> 23:55.689
[bell gonging]

24:17.222 --> 24:18.814
Is everything all right,
General?

24:18.890 --> 24:19.914
Perfect.

24:19.991 --> 24:22.118
We seem to be pushing
all the right buttons.

24:39.110 --> 24:40.509
Hey, pal.
Where's Stockwell?

24:40.579 --> 24:42.069
He's inside
with Alice.

24:42.280 --> 24:43.975
Listen, B.A. and l
will cover the alley.

24:44.049 --> 24:46.483
All right, you stay here,
keep the wheels clean.

24:46.685 --> 24:48.380
(B.A.)
Right behind you,
Faceman.

25:06.037 --> 25:07.561
General Stockwell, did....

25:09.107 --> 25:12.008
You're not.... No.
Never mind. Just never mind.

25:14.379 --> 25:15.676
Yo, yo, yo.

25:16.214 --> 25:18.079
[stuttering]
He's not here.

25:20.318 --> 25:22.343
We were ready for this.
Come on.

25:27.125 --> 25:29.184
(Frankie)
You got to keep heading
north, B.A.

25:30.729 --> 25:32.162
Make a left
at the next corner.

25:32.230 --> 25:33.390
[tires screeching]

25:33.465 --> 25:35.399
[GPS beeping]

25:45.043 --> 25:47.978
[both speaking Chinese]

25:51.249 --> 25:54.241
Well, how kind of you
to join us...

25:54.419 --> 25:56.046
General Stockwell.

25:56.621 --> 25:59.590
Seems I found your invitation
irresistible, Lin Wu.

26:00.692 --> 26:03.126
Alice, I hope you know
this means a cut in pay.

26:03.194 --> 26:05.526
You know me?
I'm flattered.

26:05.597 --> 26:09.590
Anyone who's spend any time
in this part of the world,
knows the infamous Lin Wu.

26:09.668 --> 26:12.569
Prostitution,
illegal weapons, dope...

26:12.637 --> 26:14.605
if you need it,
Lin Wu can get it for you.

26:14.673 --> 26:16.197
You know,
I always suspected...

26:16.274 --> 26:18.003
that you were
Chin's silent partner.

26:18.076 --> 26:19.134
[chuckles]

26:19.210 --> 26:21.838
I should hire you
as my press agent.

26:21.913 --> 26:24.211
She offers
a better health plan.

26:24.616 --> 26:27.210
You could never tell
by looking at the clients.

26:27.285 --> 26:30.448
I suppose this is Rajiv.
Quite correct.

26:31.222 --> 26:33.622
He chose not to
cooperate with us.

26:33.959 --> 26:35.950
This the same treatment
you gave Colonel Smith?

26:36.027 --> 26:39.224
We had a better way of
dealing with Colonel Smith.

26:40.265 --> 26:43.325
More interesting than this?
Take a close look at Rajiv.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.532
(Stockwell)
You recognize the symptoms?

26:48.006 --> 26:49.633
It's radiation poisoning.

26:53.078 --> 26:55.569
How he dies
is of no concern to us.

26:55.647 --> 26:57.114
How he got it should be.

26:57.582 --> 27:00.142
There's obviously a leak,
in the plutonium casing.

27:00.752 --> 27:02.413
I hate to think
what radiation would do...

27:02.487 --> 27:04.546
to that beautiful face
of yours, Lin Wu.

27:05.624 --> 27:07.353
Probably already exposed.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.283
Now, where's the plutonium?

27:10.362 --> 27:12.887
What if he's right?
Let's not waste anymore time.

27:13.031 --> 27:14.464
Why don't you just surrender?

27:14.532 --> 27:16.693
You underestimate us,
General.

27:17.202 --> 27:20.330
We've been onto your operation
from the moment you arrived.

27:20.405 --> 27:22.396
We know
about your accomplices...

27:22.474 --> 27:25.238
we know about your man
in the tobacco shop.

27:25.310 --> 27:28.245
We even know
about your pedicab driver.

27:28.313 --> 27:30.110
I wonder when you make
your move, Alice.

27:30.181 --> 27:32.115
Did I surprise you?
Hardly.

27:33.218 --> 27:35.186
Matter of fact,
my men are on their way here.

27:35.253 --> 27:38.450
So, you see, your only option
is to do it my way.

27:38.556 --> 27:41.081
I've had enough
of the General's witticism.

27:42.127 --> 27:43.594
Kill him now.

28:00.211 --> 28:02.702
Any closer,
General will die.

28:04.115 --> 28:05.582
You're late, gentlemen.

28:05.650 --> 28:06.844
[grunts]

28:09.854 --> 28:12.618
Well, General,
is that an old trick
you learnt in spy school?

28:12.691 --> 28:15.387
That's Preservation 101.
Nice entrance, huh?

28:17.896 --> 28:20.626
Where's Baracus?
Covering perimeters.

28:20.965 --> 28:23.263
I guess you know by now
that Alice is a double agent?

28:23.334 --> 28:24.392
It wasn't on her resume...

28:24.469 --> 28:26.596
but as you can see,
I was prepared
for that eventuality.

28:26.671 --> 28:29.037
Are you gonna introduce us
to your friend?
Stop, don't touch him!

28:29.107 --> 28:30.472
It's Rajiv.

28:30.542 --> 28:31.941
The man
who stole the plutonium.

28:32.844 --> 28:34.812
He's dying
of radiation poisoning.

28:35.413 --> 28:37.938
There was a leak
in the plutonium canister.

28:38.016 --> 28:39.210
Oh, no.

28:39.884 --> 28:41.215
Oh, great.

28:41.686 --> 28:44.211
I'm gonna die.
I'm gonna die.

28:48.793 --> 28:50.693
[speaking Chinese]

29:03.641 --> 29:05.541
[speaking Chinese]

29:07.178 --> 29:09.669
For you, no problem.

29:10.081 --> 29:12.811
It has been many years
since your last visit.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.885
I go get your clothes now.

29:15.253 --> 29:16.845
And plenty
of sponges.

29:17.355 --> 29:19.823
Sponges?
You know, sponges?

29:22.327 --> 29:23.624
Sponges.

29:24.129 --> 29:25.187
Yes.

29:26.865 --> 29:28.799
All right,
take off your clothes.

29:32.570 --> 29:34.595
(Stockwell)
All right,
let's get to it, gentlemen.

29:34.672 --> 29:36.367
We don't have much time.

29:38.176 --> 29:39.734
What's with the salt?

29:39.811 --> 29:41.278
It's iodized salt.

29:41.346 --> 29:44.747
We use it as a back up
to the radioactive pellets
we've already taken.

29:44.816 --> 29:48.582
Since we only had minimal
exposure, it's unlikely that
we have radiation poisoning.

29:48.653 --> 29:51.520
The iodine is to
protect the thyroid gland,
just in case.

29:51.589 --> 29:53.216
It's like a precaution.

29:53.558 --> 29:57.085
Right, like scrubbing down,
burning your clothes,
stuff like that.

29:57.162 --> 29:58.288
You got it.

29:58.396 --> 30:00.591
How do I look?
Good. You look good.

30:03.434 --> 30:06.198
Mr. Luk Toy
better hurry back,
or Alice is gone.

30:06.271 --> 30:08.398
Not necessarily.
She still thinks we're dead.

30:08.473 --> 30:11.374
Yeah, if she does show up,
B.A.'s in position.
He knows what to do.

30:11.910 --> 30:15.573
Ah, Mr. Santana,
you're sponges have arrived.

30:36.134 --> 30:37.294
Oh!

30:38.469 --> 30:41.632
Thank heaven you're here.
I was going to call you.

30:41.706 --> 30:43.230
You wouldn't believe
what happened.

30:43.308 --> 30:45.333
They grabbed us
right out of the club.

30:45.410 --> 30:46.570
They?

30:46.778 --> 30:48.712
Yes.
I don't know who they were.

30:48.780 --> 30:51.340
They left me alone
for a moment. I got away.

30:51.716 --> 30:54.913
I don't know what happened
with poor General Stockwell.

30:54.986 --> 30:56.749
I'm afraid he's--
(Stockwell)
Gone.

30:57.422 --> 30:58.821
But not forgotten.

30:59.123 --> 31:01.421
Why, General, it's a miracle.

31:02.427 --> 31:04.190
Indeed, it is.

31:06.931 --> 31:08.694
[gun firing]

31:30.021 --> 31:31.283
Perfect.

31:31.356 --> 31:33.517
Everything is going
as according to plan.

31:34.459 --> 31:36.757
Was an awesome idea,
Captain.

31:36.861 --> 31:39.386
Thank you, General.
But it's nothing Hannibal
wouldn't have done...

31:39.464 --> 31:40.954
if he'd had
the opportunity.

31:41.032 --> 31:44.798
Hopefully,
it's convincing enough
for Alice to run to Lin Wu.

31:44.936 --> 31:46.904
Yeah, and to Johnny,
and the plutonium.

31:47.238 --> 31:48.398
B.A., look.

31:49.040 --> 31:51.304
Look at that flower.
It's started.

31:51.376 --> 31:53.742
What you talking about?
That flower.

31:53.811 --> 31:56.507
Where I touched it,
it's turned brown.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.981
I killed that flower
with radioactivity.

31:59.083 --> 32:02.814
My hair is falling out,
I have started down
the long...

32:02.887 --> 32:05.720
Iast road to
Dante's nuclear fires.

32:06.124 --> 32:07.591
It's plastic, fool.

32:09.694 --> 32:11.685
Then it's worse
than I thought.

32:36.087 --> 32:37.145
Hello?

32:37.855 --> 32:40.688
(Bobby)
Hello? Is anybody there?
Go ahead.

32:41.859 --> 32:43.486
Just like ancient ancestors...

32:43.561 --> 32:44.823
speaking from
beyond the grave.

32:44.929 --> 32:47.159
All right,
save it for the tourists,
Bobby. What's going on?

32:47.231 --> 32:50.098
I'm at the lmperial Bank
of Hong Kong. She's inside.

32:50.168 --> 32:52.159
All right, stay with her.
We're on our way.

32:57.608 --> 32:59.269
Were you followed?

32:59.477 --> 33:02.139
Of course not.
I managed to take out
two of them.

33:02.213 --> 33:04.579
But Stockwell's going
to come after me.

33:04.649 --> 33:08.346
The plutonium is in place,
and ready for shipment
to the Libyans.

33:08.553 --> 33:10.783
When they pay us,
we are done with it.

33:10.855 --> 33:12.516
If they pay us.

33:12.590 --> 33:14.023
I thought it was leaking.

33:14.092 --> 33:16.617
They don't know that.
In one hour...

33:17.061 --> 33:18.528
it'll be their problem.

33:22.200 --> 33:26.034
All right, signal me
when you locate Colonel Smith,
and I'll activate Phase Two.

33:26.104 --> 33:28.572
Now, how do we know
Johnny's even inside there?

33:28.639 --> 33:29.901
We don't.

33:30.074 --> 33:31.371
We know that
Alice is.

33:31.442 --> 33:34.741
We know that
Wu is actively involved
in the financial community.

33:34.812 --> 33:37.280
What better place
to handle your investments
than the bank?

33:37.348 --> 33:38.713
And hopefully,
those investments...

33:38.783 --> 33:40.648
include Colonel Smith
and the plutonium.

33:40.718 --> 33:42.879
You couldn't arrange
for a floor plan in English?

33:42.954 --> 33:44.581
This is a pretty
complicated setup,
you know?

33:44.655 --> 33:46.623
(Stockwell)
This is no run-of-the-mill
bank security.

33:46.691 --> 33:49.592
Which is another reason
to believe that Wu
was involved with this bank.

33:49.660 --> 33:52.026
Every room has it's own
security camera.

33:52.096 --> 33:54.894
The security monitors
are located through
this door on the right.

33:54.966 --> 33:55.955
By using
the monitors...

33:56.034 --> 33:58.628
you'd be able
to cover the entire bank
in a couple of minutes.

33:58.703 --> 34:01.001
On the signal,
you have 10 minutes.

34:01.072 --> 34:02.300
Not a second more.

34:02.373 --> 34:05.365
Be sure to use your time
appropriately.

34:05.743 --> 34:07.005
Ten min....

34:07.412 --> 34:08.538
Ten min....

34:09.313 --> 34:10.643
My watch just stopped.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.911
First it's the plastic leaf,
now it's my watch.

34:17.088 --> 34:18.817
[both speaking Chinese]

34:20.525 --> 34:22.458
[Bobby speaking Chinese]

34:49.152 --> 34:50.677
[alarm ringing]

34:57.929 --> 35:00.022
Hello? What's going on
out there?

35:00.965 --> 35:02.660
Now my ears are ringing.

35:02.967 --> 35:04.696
They're playing our song.

35:05.536 --> 35:06.696
It's on you.

35:11.509 --> 35:12.976
He said first door
on the right.

35:13.044 --> 35:15.638
Yeah, but did he mean
first door on the right...

35:15.713 --> 35:17.647
or did he mean first door
on the right?

35:17.715 --> 35:20.479
No, he's....
I think it was....
There it is right there.

35:23.955 --> 35:25.013
Great.

35:25.089 --> 35:26.818
Have Chang come to me now.

35:28.659 --> 35:31.219
An old man tripped
one of our security beams.

35:32.096 --> 35:35.463
Nonetheless,
we move in 15 minutes.

35:40.805 --> 35:43.171
How are we supposed
to get through this....

35:45.576 --> 35:48.773
You don't suppose--
I don't want to.... I don't
even want to think about it.

35:48.846 --> 35:49.938
Okay.

35:57.755 --> 35:59.154
[grunts]

36:04.462 --> 36:06.521
(Murdock)
I've got to find Hannibal.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.566
And do you see anything,
Sergeant?

36:18.643 --> 36:19.803
Nothing yet.

36:22.713 --> 36:24.408
(Stockwell)
All right, hold your position,
Lieutenant.

36:24.482 --> 36:26.040
We're gonna need
more time.

36:26.117 --> 36:27.175
Yeah.

36:28.553 --> 36:29.747
[whispering]
Stall.

36:30.421 --> 36:31.513
What?

36:32.390 --> 36:33.789
I said stall.

36:36.694 --> 36:38.423
[speaking Chinese]

36:51.776 --> 36:52.936
Restroom.

37:05.656 --> 37:08.625
Frankie, you think
we're gonna have to
go in for checkups...

37:08.693 --> 37:11.628
and find out whether
our nose hairs are gonna
glow in the dark or not?

37:11.696 --> 37:13.391
I wanted to have a family.

37:13.464 --> 37:15.455
You think we can still
have children, Murdock?

37:15.833 --> 37:17.892
I don't think
I know you well enough.

37:23.841 --> 37:26.435
Bingo! I think
we got a winner.

37:26.978 --> 37:28.605
Zoom in on him,
Murdock.

37:37.388 --> 37:38.412
Hannibal.

37:38.889 --> 37:40.754
Hannibal.
How's he doing?

37:41.325 --> 37:43.919
Well, he's alive.
He's definitely alive.
All right.

37:44.061 --> 37:46.052
Come on, let's get him
out of here, pronto.

37:46.264 --> 37:48.323
Oh, I hope this
doesn't mean anything...

37:48.399 --> 37:50.060
but I'm developing
a splitting headache.

37:50.134 --> 37:51.192
Look, he's on
some kind of--

37:51.269 --> 37:53.863
Perhaps you would like
a pain reliever.

37:54.138 --> 37:56.333
Anything without aspirin
will be fine.

37:56.407 --> 37:59.433
Chang, will you
take these gentlemen
for a ride...

37:59.944 --> 38:01.206
and kill them?

38:02.647 --> 38:05.343
Gentlemen, we have a problem.

38:16.127 --> 38:18.254
Stockwell, this is
Empress eight. Do you read?

38:18.696 --> 38:20.664
Empress eight,
are you in position?

38:20.731 --> 38:23.222
Yes, yes. But we got
a loiterer here.

38:23.301 --> 38:24.393
All right, drop him.

38:24.468 --> 38:27.198
We need visual confirmation
on Empress nine and twelve.

38:27.271 --> 38:28.533
They are in distress.

38:28.606 --> 38:29.630
Distress?

38:29.707 --> 38:31.504
We don't make contact
in two minutes...

38:31.575 --> 38:32.974
we bring down the house.

38:33.044 --> 38:35.512
Roger. Two minutes. Out.

38:36.747 --> 38:37.975
[sighing]

38:42.320 --> 38:44.151
[groaning]

38:46.891 --> 38:48.518
Thanks for waiting, pal.

38:50.394 --> 38:53.329
You didn't like
the facilities?
Yeah. Come on, let's go.

39:17.655 --> 39:20.249
Visual confirmation.
Three escorts, back door.

39:20.558 --> 39:21.991
Condition of operatives?

39:25.229 --> 39:26.423
Bagged.

39:26.530 --> 39:27.758
Move on my signal.

39:31.235 --> 39:33.760
(B.A.)
Okay, Stockwell,
they're coming out now.

39:52.723 --> 39:53.849
All right, let's move.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.159
[Face grunting]

39:57.862 --> 39:59.523
[exclaiming]

40:01.732 --> 40:02.960
[grunts]

40:05.503 --> 40:07.528
Now I know
what a sack lunch
feels like.

40:08.038 --> 40:09.938
Hey, General,
what's keeping those fools?

40:18.249 --> 40:19.910
[both grunting]

40:58.022 --> 40:59.387
[groaning]

40:59.990 --> 41:01.685
Dr. Stockwell, I assume.

41:02.159 --> 41:03.421
You okay, Hannibal?

41:03.694 --> 41:05.184
Yeah, what took
you guys so long?

41:05.262 --> 41:07.628
Well, you didn't leave
a forwarding address,
Hannibal.

41:07.698 --> 41:10.064
Hannibal,
down and dirty, man.

41:10.167 --> 41:11.896
Good to have you
back with us, Colonel.

41:11.969 --> 41:13.800
Let's get back
to the matter at hand.

41:13.871 --> 41:15.395
Status of the mission?

41:15.473 --> 41:17.873
Code Red. And according
to your message...

41:17.942 --> 41:20.877
match point
is in 22 minutes.

41:21.045 --> 41:22.273
Let's go, B.A.

41:22.346 --> 41:25.008
The plutonium's at Pier 26.
Right, Hannibal.

41:39.763 --> 41:41.594
Well, I knew Alice
would try to set me up.

41:41.665 --> 41:43.326
But they moved quicker
than I figured.

41:43.400 --> 41:45.129
Probably followed you
back from the hotel.

41:45.202 --> 41:46.965
I should have
picked up on it.

41:47.037 --> 41:49.562
Sorry, Hannibal.
Don't worry about it,
Bobby.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.198
We couldn't have
done it without you.

41:51.275 --> 41:53.436
You mean the A-Team
couldn't have done it
without me?

41:53.611 --> 41:55.010
Primo, man.

42:14.999 --> 42:16.466
Pier 26, Hannibal.

42:29.046 --> 42:30.980
Looks like they're already
loaded up.

42:31.282 --> 42:33.375
Go, B.A.
Right, Hannibal.

42:37.488 --> 42:38.921
Are you
out of your mind?

42:38.989 --> 42:39.978
[chuckles]

42:53.070 --> 42:54.697
[men shouting]

43:03.380 --> 43:05.143
[guns firing]

43:36.347 --> 43:38.247
[all coughing]

43:46.790 --> 43:49.850
I don't know much
about nuclear materials,
General...

43:49.960 --> 43:53.361
but I don't think
it would be healthy
if I were to fire right now.

43:53.430 --> 43:56.365
Well now, that would ruin
a perfectly nice day.

43:56.433 --> 43:58.060
You don't possibly think
you can win?

43:58.135 --> 44:01.468
Like you said,
I'm probably already exposed.

44:01.905 --> 44:03.395
I got nothing to lose.

44:03.540 --> 44:04.802
[yelling]

44:36.607 --> 44:37.767
Well, now.

44:37.941 --> 44:40.102
Love it when our plans
comes together.

44:40.577 --> 44:41.805
Well said.

44:46.517 --> 44:48.542
(Face)
I'm telling you,
according to the tests...

44:48.619 --> 44:52.953
we haven't been exposed
to enough radiation to
have any immediate effects.

44:53.023 --> 44:54.752
(Murdock)
Well, that's good,
'cause I'm too cute...

44:54.825 --> 44:56.816
to go through life
like a night-light.

44:57.127 --> 44:59.994
What do you mean,
"immediate effects"?

45:00.064 --> 45:01.998
I wouldn't lose
any sleep over it.

45:02.066 --> 45:03.761
Yeah, I don't suppose
you might wanna...

45:03.834 --> 45:06.132
take along a healthy
Chinese kid with you?

45:06.336 --> 45:08.566
Enjoy your freedom
while you can, kid.

45:08.639 --> 45:10.163
I know I would.

45:10.641 --> 45:13.508
Grandfather say,
"Freedom is like hiccup.

45:13.711 --> 45:16.077
"You must lose it
before it is appreciated."

45:16.146 --> 45:18.011
Your grandfather
must be quite a guy.

45:18.082 --> 45:20.107
Don't know.
Never met him.

45:20.184 --> 45:21.947
See, tourists eat
this stuff up.

45:22.019 --> 45:23.680
[all laughing]

45:23.921 --> 45:25.889
Gentlemen,
you'll be happy to know...

45:25.956 --> 45:28.481
that Sergeant Baracus has
completed his examination...

45:28.559 --> 45:31.619
and he is as unaffected
by the radiation
as the rest of us.

45:31.829 --> 45:33.729
So, in the light
of this good news...

45:33.797 --> 45:35.424
we're going home in 12 hours.

45:35.499 --> 45:38.093
I thought we were
entitled to a vacation,
General.

45:38.569 --> 45:40.434
Correct. 1 2 hours worth.

45:41.171 --> 45:42.695
Gentlemen, eyes here.

45:44.575 --> 45:46.042
Now that I've had
an opportunity...

45:46.110 --> 45:48.340
to evaluate your methods
more intimately...

45:48.412 --> 45:50.403
I am anxious
to get you
back to work.

45:51.348 --> 45:53.339
(Frankie)
General, how come
all the sponges?

45:53.984 --> 45:57.078
One of the rewards
of doing it my way.
