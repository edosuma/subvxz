WEBVTT

00:07.638 --> 00:13.013
( sniffing ) UGH!
SMELLS LIKE SOMETHING
DIED IN HERE.

00:13.013 --> 00:17.288
WHOA! SOMETHING
DID DIE IN HERE!
CHASE, LOOK AT THIS!

00:17.288 --> 00:18.649
NO!

00:18.649 --> 00:21.452
WELL, AT LEAST TELL ME
IF THIS IS FUR OR MOLD.

00:21.452 --> 00:22.553
NO!

00:27.458 --> 00:29.500
ADAM, WHAT DID
YOU DO TO YOUR SHOE?

00:29.500 --> 00:31.362
I GUESS I DON'T KNOW
MY OWN STRENGTH.

00:31.362 --> 00:34.505
THE SAME THING HAPPENED
YESTERDAY WITH MY UNDERWEAR.

00:34.505 --> 00:37.808
OH, THAT REMINDS ME,
I GOT YOU A NEW
HEADBAND FOR GYM CLASS.

00:41.812 --> 00:44.115
MAN, MR. DAVENPORT
WARNED US ABOUT THIS.

00:44.115 --> 00:48.479
AS WE GET OLDER, OUR CHIPS
HAVE TO BE RE-CALIBRATED
TO ADJUST FOR OUR GROWTH.

00:48.479 --> 00:52.283
( laughing )
OH, WELL, THEN YOURS WILL
NEVER HAVE TO BE ADJUSTED.

00:52.283 --> 00:55.326
'CAUSE YOUR BODY
DOESN'T GROW, GET IT?

00:55.326 --> 00:58.629
I'M SAYING
YOU'RE SMALL.
 I GET IT!

00:58.629 --> 01:00.491
WHEN MR. DAVENPORT
GETS BACK,

01:00.491 --> 01:02.463
HE CAN RE-CALIBRATE
YOUR SUPER STRENGTH.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.265
TOSS ME MY BACKPACK.

01:08.439 --> 01:10.271
OR WE COULD DO IT NOW.

01:11.542 --> 01:12.703
QUICK, GET IN YOUR CAPSULE.

01:12.703 --> 01:15.075
AH, BUT I LIKE BEING
RIDICULOUSLY STRONG.

01:15.075 --> 01:18.579
I'M LIKE KING KONG WITHOUT
THE LITTLE LADY IN HIS HAND.

01:18.579 --> 01:22.113
GO AHEAD, CHASE,
JUMP IN.

01:22.113 --> 01:24.555
GO!
 FINE.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.360
ALL RIGHT, LET'S SEE,
ADAM'S SIZE PARAMETERS.

01:29.360 --> 01:32.223
SIX-ONE, HUNDRED
AND SEVENTY-FIVE POUNDS.

01:32.223 --> 01:36.367
MAKE IT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY.
HAD A BIG BREAKFAST.

01:36.367 --> 01:38.269
SINCE YOUR STRENGTH
HAS INTENSIFIED,

01:38.269 --> 01:40.531
I'M GONNA DIAL IT BACK
FROM AN EIGHT TO A SIX.

01:40.531 --> 01:43.204
HOLD ON, YOU CAN
ADJUST MY STRENGTH?

01:43.204 --> 01:45.606
WELL, DON'T DIAL ME DOWN,
MAKE ME A TEN!

01:45.606 --> 01:47.138
NO WAY.
THAT WOULD BE LIKE

01:47.138 --> 01:50.311
GIVING A STICK OF DYNAMITE
TO A...

01:50.311 --> 01:52.243
WELL, YOU.

01:59.450 --> 02:03.224
THERE. DONE. NOW HURRY.
WE'RE GONNA BE LATE FOR SCHOOL.

02:05.456 --> 02:07.498
UH, YEAH, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE!
I JUST HAVE TO

02:07.498 --> 02:09.660
NOT DO SOMETHING
FOR A MINUTE.

02:22.843 --> 02:25.616
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
IF IT WORKED!

02:25.616 --> 02:28.679
THE WORLD'S FIRST BIONIC
SUPER-HUMANS.

02:28.679 --> 02:32.783
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,
FASTER, SMARTER.

02:32.783 --> 02:35.486
THE NEXT GENERATION OF
THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:35.486 --> 02:37.558
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

02:37.558 --> 02:40.431
♪♪

02:40.431 --> 02:41.632
♪ LAB RATS ♪

02:43.664 --> 02:45.296
♪ LAB RATS ♪

02:54.675 --> 02:55.776

02:57.678 --> 02:59.350
♪ LAB RATS ♪

03:06.717 --> 03:08.389
♪ LAB RATS ♪

03:16.527 --> 03:19.400
MAN, I ALWAYS GET STUCK
WITH THE WOBBLY CHAIR.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.202
HERE, LET ME FIX IT.
HOLD MY TRAY.

03:25.976 --> 03:27.338
ADAM!

03:27.338 --> 03:28.709
( laughing )

03:28.709 --> 03:30.681
BUDGET CUTS, AM I RIGHT?

03:30.681 --> 03:32.683
THE EVIDENCE IS
ALL AROUND US, PEOPLE.

03:32.683 --> 03:34.685
( laughing )

03:34.685 --> 03:36.917
YOU MAXED OUT YOUR SUPER
STRENGTH, DIDN'T YOU?

03:36.917 --> 03:40.551
OF COURSE I DID.
LOOK WHO YOU'RE TALKING TO.

03:40.551 --> 03:41.992
THIS IS SO DANGEROUS.

03:41.992 --> 03:43.854
YOU CAN'T CONTROL
YOUR STRENGTH,

03:43.854 --> 03:45.626
AND IT COULD CAUSE
A TON OF GLITCHES.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.227
WE HAVE TO CHANGE
YOU BACK, NOW!

03:47.227 --> 03:49.430
CALM DOWN,
YOU'RE OVER-REACTING.

03:56.437 --> 03:58.739
OKAY, YOU CAN DIAL ME
DOWN TO A NINE.

04:02.913 --> 04:06.347
MORNING, OXYGEN HOGS!

04:06.347 --> 04:08.619
TIME FOR ANOTHER SURPRISE
LOCKER INSPECTION!

04:08.619 --> 04:11.722
WHY, YOU ASK?
THE SUPERINTENDENT SAYS

04:11.722 --> 04:14.725
THAT IF I'M GONNA ACCUSE YOU
LITTLE CRIMINALS OF DOING STUFF

04:14.725 --> 04:18.629
I NEED "EVIDENCE."

04:18.629 --> 04:20.630
LINDSEY, YOU'RE UP.

04:21.661 --> 04:24.295
( annoyed sound )

04:24.295 --> 04:25.566
( laughing )

04:25.566 --> 04:28.599
STUFFED ANIMAL?
WHAT IS THIS, YOUR PROM DATE?

04:30.541 --> 04:33.674
MAKEUP? YOU'VE ALREADY LOST
THAT BATTLE, SWEETHEART.

04:35.606 --> 04:38.449
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I AM SO TIRED
OF PRINCIPAL PERRY

04:38.449 --> 04:39.810
AND HER POWER TRIPS.
HOW, HOW DOES SHE

04:39.810 --> 04:41.752
KEEP GETTING AWAY
WITH THIS STUFF?

04:41.752 --> 04:45.556
JUST ACCEPT IT.
IT'S A LOT EASIER ONCE
YOU LET GO OF THE HOPE.

04:45.556 --> 04:49.990
OOH, PRETZEL LOGS! JACKPOT!

04:49.990 --> 04:52.963
YOU'RE NEXT,
GLOW STICK.

04:54.425 --> 04:56.727
I DON'T THINK SO.

04:56.727 --> 04:58.999
( grunts )

04:58.999 --> 05:00.501
( yells )

05:00.501 --> 05:02.773
( laughing )
STIFF ARM. LEGAL PLAY.

05:02.773 --> 05:06.577
OKAY, PRINCIPAL PERRY,
THIS IS NOT FAIR.

05:06.577 --> 05:08.709
YOU WALK AROUND HERE
LIKE A DICTATOR

05:08.709 --> 05:10.681
AND TREAT THE STUDENT
BODY LIKE PRISONERS.

05:10.681 --> 05:14.515
AWW, YOU NOTICED.
IT'S SO GOOD
TO BE APPRECIATED.

05:14.515 --> 05:17.688
NO. THIS IS NO WAY
TO RUN A SCHOOL.

05:17.688 --> 05:20.551
AND I THINK THAT
I SPEAK FOR EVERYONE

05:20.551 --> 05:22.823
WHEN I SAY WE'RE NOT
GONNA TAKE IT ANYMORE!

05:22.823 --> 05:26.997
( students gasping )

05:26.997 --> 05:30.631
AND BY "WE" SHE MEANS HER.
YOU AND ME, ROCK SOLID.

05:33.033 --> 05:36.066
ARE YOU CHALLENGING
MY AUTHORITY?

05:36.066 --> 05:40.340
SHE'S SWEATING
THROUGH HER PANT SUIT.
RETREAT, RETREAT!

05:40.340 --> 05:42.973
LISTEN, LIPSTICK,
I DIDN'T COMMAND A SHIP

05:42.973 --> 05:46.747
IN THE MERCHANT MARINES
TO TAKE GUFF FROM YOU.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.550
YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK
THE SCHOOL MIGHT BE
A BIT MORE ENJOYABLE

05:49.550 --> 05:51.051
IF WE WERE TREATED
LIKE ADULTS

05:51.051 --> 05:52.883
AND HAD MORE FREEDOM.

05:52.883 --> 05:56.457
RIGHT, AND THEN
WE COULD ALL RIDE
UNICORNS TO SCHOOL

05:56.457 --> 06:00.060
AND EAT FOOD THAT PASSES
A HEALTH INSPECTION.

06:00.060 --> 06:02.433
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE
TO BE LIKE THIS.

06:02.433 --> 06:05.396
OH, YES, IT DOES. I LEARNED
ONE THING FROM MY MOTHER:

06:05.396 --> 06:06.967
TO RULE WITH AN IRON FIST.

06:06.967 --> 06:10.671
OH, AND THAT SALAD TAKES UP
SPACE WHERE MEAT SHOULD BE.

06:11.972 --> 06:15.676
SHE SOUNDS
LIKE A LOVELY WOMAN.
 SHE ISN'T!

06:15.676 --> 06:19.580
YOU KIDS THINK MY JOB
IS SO EASY, DON'T YA?

06:19.580 --> 06:22.953
( laughing ) WELL, I MEAN, HOW
HARD CAN IT BE? YOU DO IT.

06:22.953 --> 06:25.085
( students gasping )

06:25.085 --> 06:27.918
YOU THINK YOU CAN
DO BETTER? ALL RIGHT!

06:27.918 --> 06:30.160
HAVE AT IT.
SCHOOL'S YOURS.

06:30.160 --> 06:32.463
YOU GO AHEAD
AND BE PRINCIPAL FOR A DAY.

06:32.463 --> 06:34.164
WHAT?
 YEAH.

06:34.164 --> 06:36.166
GO AHEAD AND BE
THE NICE PRINCIPAL.

06:36.166 --> 06:39.670
THESE MAGGOTS WILL
EAT YOU ALIVE IN TWO HOURS.
 HMM.

06:39.670 --> 06:42.032
YOU COULDA USE
YOUR LAST BREATH
TO SCREAM FOR HELP,

06:42.032 --> 06:44.905
BUT YOU SHOULDA USED
IT TO SAY "I'M SORRY."
 OH!

06:48.509 --> 06:52.443
ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE ON.
BUT IF I'M GONNA BE
PRINCIPAL FOR THE DAY,

06:52.443 --> 06:54.985
I'LL NEED THE KEYS
TO YOUR OFFICE.
 ALL RIGHT.

06:54.985 --> 06:57.788
BUT REMEMBER,
NO MATTER HOW LOUD
THE BANGING GETS

06:57.788 --> 07:00.420
IN THE FILE CABINET,
DON'T OPEN IT.

07:06.797 --> 07:08.629
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
MAXED OUT YOUR STRENGTH

07:08.629 --> 07:10.901
AFTER I SPECIFICALLY
TOLD YOU NOT TO.

07:10.901 --> 07:13.133
IN MY DEFENSE,
YOU TELLING ME
WHAT TO DO IS LIKE

07:13.133 --> 07:17.538
A MONKEY TELLING
A HEDGEHOG WHAT TO DO--
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.541
BUT IT WOULD MAKE AN
AWESOME BUDDY COP MOVIE.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.843
CAN WE JUST PLEASE
GET THIS OVER WITH?

07:22.843 --> 07:25.115
I GOTTA GET BACK
TO SCHOOL.
IT'S KARAOKE DAY

07:25.115 --> 07:29.019
IN LATIN CLASS AND
I'M SINGING TWINKLE
TWINKLE LITTLE STAR.

07:29.019 --> 07:33.123
( singing in Latin )
 SCINTILLAT SCINTILLAT
PAULO STELLA...

07:34.785 --> 07:36.687
( laughing )

07:36.687 --> 07:39.860
YOU DO KNOW YOU'RE
NEVER GONNA HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND, RIGHT?

07:39.860 --> 07:44.565
YEAH? AND YOURS IS GONNA
HAVE TO CUT YOUR FOOD,
SO WE'RE EVEN.

07:44.565 --> 07:47.998
GET IN YOUR CAPSULE!

07:47.998 --> 07:53.744
ALL RIGHT, REDUCING
SUPER STRENGTH IN
THREE, TWO, ONE...

07:58.909 --> 08:00.911
ALL RIGHT, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY TEST IT OUT

08:00.911 --> 08:02.783
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE
BACK TO NORMAL. COME HERE.

08:05.856 --> 08:09.119
THIS IS MADE OUT OF
ULTRA-STRENGTH TITANIUM.

08:09.119 --> 08:10.861
THINK YOU CAN BREAK IT?
 SURE,

08:10.861 --> 08:14.625
STAND STILL WHILE
I SMASH IT OVER YOUR HEAD.

08:14.625 --> 08:17.968
NO, WITH YOUR HAND.
 NOT AS FUN,
BUT OKAY.

08:17.968 --> 08:19.970
( exhales )

08:22.873 --> 08:25.075
AH, I'M BACK
TO NORMAL.

08:25.075 --> 08:27.778
NOW I'M ONLY A HUNDRED
TIMES STRONGER THAN YOU.

08:27.778 --> 08:28.939
( sighing )
I GUESS I'M GONNA
HAVE TO HIT YOU

08:28.939 --> 08:31.642
MORE OFTEN
TO MAKE UP FOR IT.

08:31.642 --> 08:34.514
YOU REALLY DON'T
HAVE TO.
 OH, THAT'S SWEET.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.787
BUT I REALLY DO.

08:36.787 --> 08:37.948
NO, YOU DON'T.
 YES, I DO.

08:37.948 --> 08:39.119
NO, YOU DON'T.
 COME HERE.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.650
STOP. GET AWAY.
DON'T TOUCH ME.

08:40.650 --> 08:43.222
DON'T-- GET AWAY,
GET AWAY. NO, NO!
( yells )

08:47.257 --> 08:48.759
( laughs )

08:51.632 --> 08:53.764
WHOA! IT'S ONLY
BEEN A FEW HOURS,

08:53.764 --> 08:56.667
BUT LOOK HOW MUCH
HAPPIER EVERYONE
IS UNDER PRINCIPAL BREE.

08:56.667 --> 08:59.870
WELL, THAT IS
JUST HOW I ROLL,
VICE PRINCIPAL LEO.

08:59.870 --> 09:02.042
( laughing )

09:02.042 --> 09:04.675
I MEAN, ISN'T IT AMAZING
HOW MUCH HAPPIER

09:04.675 --> 09:05.976
AND MORE PRODUCTIVE
STUDENTS ARE WHEN

09:05.976 --> 09:07.578
THEY'RE GIVEN
A LITTLE BIT OF FREEDOM?

09:07.578 --> 09:10.581
LET BREEDOM RING!

09:12.723 --> 09:14.955
OH, UH, BY THE WAY,
I HAVE SOME PAPERWORK
FOR YOU TO SIGN.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.286
SURE. WHAT IS IT?

09:16.286 --> 09:18.558
YOU KNOW,
JUST AN APPROVAL FORM,

09:18.558 --> 09:20.330
FORCING ALL GIRLS
TO BE MY FRIEND.

09:21.892 --> 09:25.666
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
STOP TALKING ON THE PHONE!

09:25.666 --> 09:27.638
SPIT OUT THAT GUM!

09:27.638 --> 09:28.969
UH-UH, DON'T YOU
LISTEN TO HER!

09:28.969 --> 09:30.971
PUT THAT GUM BACK
IN YOUR MOUTH.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.644
HEY--

09:33.644 --> 09:35.205
THIS IS MY SCHOOL NOW.

09:35.205 --> 09:38.679
SEE HOW SMOOTHLY THINGS
ARE RUNNING AND HOW
HAPPY EVERYONE IS?

09:38.679 --> 09:42.282
( grunting )
I KNOW, IT'S DISGUSTING!

09:42.282 --> 09:45.015
ALL THESE SMILING FACES.

09:45.015 --> 09:49.890
I HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MANY
TEETH SINCE I KEPT DENTAL
RECORDS AT THE MORGUE.

09:49.890 --> 09:53.724
SORRY, PRINCIPAL PERRY,
BUT I GUESS IT IS EASY
DOING YOUR JOB.
 ( scoffs )

09:53.724 --> 09:55.626
YEAH!
 WATCH IT, DOOLEY!

09:55.626 --> 09:58.699
AH-AH-AH-AH!
CORRECTION:

09:58.699 --> 10:02.703
VICE PRINCIPAL DOOLEY.
AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,

10:02.703 --> 10:05.035
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO BE HERE UNLESS YOU'RE
A STUDENT OR FACULTY.

10:05.035 --> 10:08.979
SO I'M AFRAID,
I'M GOING TO HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE...

10:08.979 --> 10:10.110
TERRY.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.043
( grunting )
THIS ISN'T OVER!

10:13.043 --> 10:16.687
( phone ringing )

10:16.687 --> 10:19.219
WHAT, MOM? I'M AT WORK!

10:19.219 --> 10:22.693
SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN
TO RAISE MY VOICE.

10:22.693 --> 10:24.795
YES, I'VE BEEN A BAD GIRL.

10:27.698 --> 10:29.399
( bell rings )

10:32.863 --> 10:34.705
HEY, CHASE,
WHEN YOU ZAPPED ME
I THINK YOU TOOK

10:34.705 --> 10:36.667
A LITTLE BIT
OF WEIGHT OFF.
 ADAM,

10:36.667 --> 10:38.709
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT.

10:38.709 --> 10:41.141
THE RE-CALIBRATION
ADJUSTS THE RATIO
OF YOUR MUSCLE MASS

10:41.141 --> 10:44.174
TO YOUR BODY FRAME AND,
AND, WHO AM I KIDDING?

10:44.174 --> 10:46.977
YOU STOPPED LISTENING
FIVE SECONDS AGO, RIGHT?

10:48.979 --> 10:50.781
ADAM?

10:52.422 --> 10:53.954
ADAM?

10:53.954 --> 10:55.956
( in high-pitched voice )
I'M DOWN HERE!

10:58.358 --> 11:00.891
TOLD YOU I WAS
LOSING WEIGHT.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.269
CHASE, WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:09.269 --> 11:11.802
I, I, I GUESS I WAS
IN SUCH A RUSH
TO RE-CALIBRATE

11:11.802 --> 11:13.774
YOUR CHIP, I,
I ACCIDENTALLY
FORGOT TO ENTER

11:13.774 --> 11:16.376
THE SIZE PARAMETERS,
WHICH CAUSED A GLITCH AND--

11:16.376 --> 11:19.910
I'M TWO INCHES TALL
AND NAKED! DO SOMETHING!

11:22.753 --> 11:25.716
REALLY, CHASE?
A PURPLE NINJA OUTFIT?

11:25.716 --> 11:28.058
YOU KNOW PURPLE'S
NOT MY COLOR!

11:28.058 --> 11:29.990
IT WAS FROM
THE LOST AND FOUND.

11:29.990 --> 11:32.422
THERE WERE ONLY TWO ACTION
FIGURES, THIS AND POWER GIRL.

11:32.422 --> 11:35.866
AND YOU DON NOT HAVE
THE LEGS TO WORK THAT SKIRT.

11:35.866 --> 11:38.368
HA. JUST HURRY UP
AND FIX THIS!

11:38.368 --> 11:40.801
I CAN'T STAND BEING
SMALLER THAN YOU.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.774
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN SMALLER
THAN YOU FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE.

11:43.774 --> 11:44.975
NOW YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE.

11:44.975 --> 11:47.077
DO YOU REMEMBER ALL
THE NAMES YOU CALLED ME?

11:47.077 --> 11:49.239
NOT ALL OF 'EM,
BUT I REMEMBER THERE WAS

11:49.239 --> 11:53.784
TINYPANTS MCGOO, MICROMAN,
TINY BOY, ANT BOY, EENCY MEENCY,

11:53.784 --> 11:55.916
LITTLE WOMAN...
( laughing )

11:55.916 --> 11:57.447
HEY! WHOA, HEY!

11:57.447 --> 12:00.420
Adam: WHY IS IT DARK?
WHAT'S GOING ON? LET ME OUT!

12:01.721 --> 12:03.854
HEY, WHAT'D YOU
DO THAT FOR?

12:03.854 --> 12:05.295
I WANTED YOU TO SEE
WHAT IT'S LIKE

12:05.295 --> 12:07.297
TO BE PICKED ON BY
SOMEONE LARGER THAN YOU.

12:07.297 --> 12:09.229
BUT, SINCE
I'M A NICE GUY,

12:09.229 --> 12:10.500
NOW I'LL TAKE YOU
HOME TO FIX YOU.

12:10.500 --> 12:13.163
THANK YOU, CHASE,
IT'S REALLY BIG OF YOU.

12:13.163 --> 12:16.106
AND I DON'T GET TO SAY
THAT VERY OFTEN. HA HA.

12:16.106 --> 12:18.008
YOU JUST CAN'T
STOP YOURSELF,
CAN YOU?

12:18.008 --> 12:22.112
I'LL TRY.
UM, YOU'RE HUGE...

12:22.112 --> 12:24.214
LY SMALL.
NOPE, CAN'T DO IT.

12:25.445 --> 12:27.517
YOU KNOW WHAT?
FORGET HOME.

12:27.517 --> 12:29.479
WE'RE GONNA HAVE
A LITTLE FUN.

12:29.479 --> 12:31.221
NO, NO, NO, NO. NO! NO!

12:32.783 --> 12:35.025
YOU KNOW THAT NEW TARANTULA
IN THE SCIENCE LAB?

12:35.025 --> 12:37.327
OH, YEAH, HARVEY!
HE'S GREAT.

12:37.327 --> 12:39.759
WELL, LET'S SEE
HOW GREAT HE IS
WHEN HE GETS

12:39.759 --> 12:42.362
A SURPRISE VISIT FROM
A TINY, PURPLE NINJA.

12:42.362 --> 12:45.465
NO!
( yelling )

12:48.538 --> 12:51.001
HEY, WHERE IS EVERYONE?

12:51.001 --> 12:52.772
WHY IS NO ONE IN CLASS?

12:52.772 --> 12:56.076
( music playing distantly )

12:58.809 --> 13:00.350
( music playing )

13:07.117 --> 13:08.358
PRINCIPAL PERRY?

13:08.358 --> 13:10.861
WHO WANTS TO KNOW?
( laughing )

13:10.861 --> 13:16.026
THE NAME'S TERRY.
ON THE STREET THEY CALL
ME T.P. 'CAUSE I CLEAN UP.

13:16.026 --> 13:21.832
UM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
 NEVER MIND THAT,
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

13:21.832 --> 13:24.304
WELL, THE MORE
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT,
IT SEEMED ONLY FAIR

13:24.304 --> 13:26.306
THAT IF YOU GET TO BE
PRINCIPAL FOR A DAY,

13:26.306 --> 13:29.809
THEN I GET TO BE
A STUDENT FOR A DAY.
( laughing )

13:31.311 --> 13:32.983
SINCE YOU'RE SUCH
A BIG FAN OF FREEDOM,

13:32.983 --> 13:35.145
I THOUGHT I'D SHOW YOU
WHAT IT REALLY LOOKS LIKE.

13:35.145 --> 13:38.488
BERTHA, RUTHIE,
SADDLE UP!

13:38.488 --> 13:40.250
( students chanting )
GO, GO, GO, GO,

13:40.250 --> 13:41.591
GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!

13:41.591 --> 13:43.353
( students cheering )

13:43.353 --> 13:45.926
( crashing sound )

13:45.926 --> 13:50.130
OH! SHE JUST GOT LOAFED!
( laughing )

13:50.130 --> 13:53.964
IF SHE GETS HURT
WHILE YOU'RE PRINCIPAL,
YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE.

13:53.964 --> 13:56.937
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY DO
TO PRINCIPALS IN PRISON?

13:56.937 --> 14:00.110
WELL, YOU CAN'T
THREATEN ME.
VICE PRINCIPAL LEO?

14:00.110 --> 14:01.841
MY PLEASURE.
 HMM.

14:01.841 --> 14:05.215
YOU JUST GOT DETENTION,
SQUAT MUG.

14:05.215 --> 14:07.117
DO YOU REALLY
WANNA GO THERE,
KNOWING THAT

14:07.117 --> 14:10.180
I'M BACK TO RUNNING
THIS PLACE TOMORROW?

14:10.180 --> 14:13.383
AND I QUIT.
YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN, BREE.

14:13.383 --> 14:14.885
WHAT?

14:14.885 --> 14:17.127
SO, YOU READY TO GIVE UP?

14:17.127 --> 14:20.991
( scoffing ) NOT A CHANCE.
BECAUSE FREEDOM IS ALWAYS--

14:20.991 --> 14:23.463
Principal Perry:
OH!
( laughing )

14:23.463 --> 14:26.466
SORRY, I COULDN'T HEAR
YOU WITH ALL THAT
FREEDOM ON YOUR FACE.

14:26.466 --> 14:27.968
( laughing )

14:27.968 --> 14:30.370
SOMEBODY GET THIS GIRL
SOME GRAVY.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.042
( laughing )

14:33.873 --> 14:37.647
ALL RIGHT, ADAM,
TIME FOR A WATER
FOUNTAIN JERK BATH.

14:38.578 --> 14:42.612
ADAM? ADAM?
OH, NO! ADAM?

14:44.484 --> 14:46.216
ADAM?

14:47.617 --> 14:50.520
( laughing )
NEW INTERNET DANCE CRAZE.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.622
LOOK IT UP.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.496
LEO!
 'SUP?

14:56.496 --> 14:58.898
I NEED YOUR HELP.
I ACCIDENTALLY SHRUNK
ADAM AND HE IS GONE!

14:58.898 --> 15:01.031
I GOT YOUR BACK.
YOU WERE WITH ME,
WE WERE KAYAKING.

15:01.031 --> 15:03.303
NO QUESTIONS ASKED.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.536
NO! HE WAS IN MY
POCKET BUT HE FELL OUT.
I LOST HIM!

15:06.536 --> 15:08.608
THEY'LL NEVER BUY IT.
STICK TO THE KAYAK.

15:10.280 --> 15:12.582
I DON'T KNOW WHERE HE IS.
HE COULD BE ANYWHERE!

15:12.582 --> 15:15.385
CHASE! LEO!
I'M OVER HERE!

15:15.385 --> 15:17.517
OVER HERE!

15:17.517 --> 15:19.549
AAH! INCOMING BUTT!

15:21.551 --> 15:25.555
HA! NO ONE CAN
DEFEAT THE BUTT-NINJA.

15:29.399 --> 15:32.032
HEY, I HAVE THOSE JEANS!

15:32.032 --> 15:33.663
NO, DON'T SIT DOWN,
DON'T SIT DOWN!

15:33.663 --> 15:35.565
( yells )

15:35.565 --> 15:38.038
CHASE, I THINK
I JUST SAW A LITTLE,

15:38.038 --> 15:41.571
PURPLE NINJA DIVE
INTO THAT BOOK BAG.

15:41.571 --> 15:44.374
AND THERE'S SOMETHING
I'LL NEVER SAY AGAIN.

15:44.374 --> 15:47.077
GO, GO!

15:54.724 --> 15:56.686
SORRY, MA'AM.
RANDOM BAG SEARCH.

15:56.686 --> 15:59.629
THERE'S BEEN A RASH OF CROUTON
THEFT AT THE SALAD BAR.

15:59.629 --> 16:02.532
WE'RE NOT SAYING IT'S YOU,
BUT WE'RE ALL THINKIN' IT.

16:04.964 --> 16:08.098
A-HA! I GOT HIM.
 YOU GOT HIM?

16:08.098 --> 16:12.502
DUDE! YOU ALMOST
SPILLED MY THIRD LUNCH.

16:12.502 --> 16:14.104
RIGHT. SORRY.

16:17.177 --> 16:21.651
OH!

16:21.651 --> 16:26.616
OH, WOW, GIGANTIC FOOD.
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.560
OOH, PICKLES!

16:34.324 --> 16:36.496
ADAM, GET OUT OF THERE!

16:36.496 --> 16:37.497
OH!

16:42.632 --> 16:44.604
( yelling )

16:44.604 --> 16:47.006
( grunting )

16:47.006 --> 16:49.609
BRAVER MEN THAN YOU HAVE
TRIED TO TAKE MY FOOD BEFORE.

16:49.609 --> 16:50.780
THEY AIN'T MEN NOW.

16:53.683 --> 16:55.515
I WON'T LET YOU
EAT MY BROTHER!

16:55.515 --> 17:00.450
( scoffs )
YOU VEGETARIANS
MAKE ME SICK.

17:00.450 --> 17:02.292
IT'S A TURKEY,
NOT YOUR BROTHER.

17:02.292 --> 17:04.794
NOW GIVE ME BACK
THAT BIRD, HIPPIE!
 NO!

17:04.794 --> 17:06.425
NO, NO!
 YES, YES!

17:06.425 --> 17:07.527
GE-- LET GO
OF THE BIRD!

17:07.527 --> 17:09.529
DROP THE BURGER,
TERRY!

17:09.529 --> 17:12.232
HOW ABOUT I DROP YOU,
GIRLIE?

17:12.232 --> 17:15.065
HMM, I HAD A FEELING
YOU MIGHT SAY THAT.

17:15.065 --> 17:17.067
WHICH IS WHY I BROUGHT
IN THE BIG GUNS.

17:17.067 --> 17:19.069
THERESA!

17:21.411 --> 17:23.413
MOTHER?

17:23.413 --> 17:25.275
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:25.275 --> 17:29.649
THIS LOVELY YOUNG LADY
CALLED ME AND SAID
YOU WERE CAUSING TROUBLE.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.682
WHAT DID I TELL YOU
ABOUT WRESTLING FOR FOOD?

17:32.682 --> 17:36.386
OH! THAT IF
YOU'RE GONNA DO IT,
YOU BETTER WIN?

17:36.386 --> 17:40.130
DON'T YOU SASS
YOUR MOMMA!
 SORRY, MOTHER.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.364
HANDS OFF, TROLL!

17:46.196 --> 17:49.669
I APOLOGIZE FOR HER
CAUSING SO MUCH TROUBLE.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.371
SHE'S NOT REALLY
THE PRINCIPAL!

17:51.371 --> 17:54.244
AND YOU'RE NOT
REALLY A CHILD,
SO STOP ACTING LIKE ONE!

17:54.244 --> 17:56.506
( grunting )

17:56.506 --> 18:00.580
THERESA, WHAT DO YOU
SAY TO PRINCIPAL BREE?

18:00.580 --> 18:03.583
( yelling )

18:05.655 --> 18:08.558
SORRY.
 BIG GIRL VOICE!

18:08.558 --> 18:11.321
SORRY!

18:11.321 --> 18:16.095
I'M GOING TO TAKE HER HOME
AND GIVE HER A GOOD TALKING TO.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.668
MM, I THINK
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

18:18.668 --> 18:20.370
NO, MOMMA, NO,
NO, NO, MOMMA!

18:20.370 --> 18:22.632
NO, MOMMA, NO,
NO, NO, NO! NO--

18:22.632 --> 18:24.374
HEY, HEY, HEY!

18:24.374 --> 18:26.276
( yelling )

18:32.142 --> 18:33.643
THANKS A LOT, RUTHIE.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.618
Both:
I LOST MY RETAINER.

18:40.820 --> 18:42.892
( laughing nervously )

18:49.599 --> 18:52.462
GOT HIM! OH, WAIT,
NO, THAT'S A CELERY STICK.

18:53.903 --> 18:57.607
AH, GOT HIM!
WAIT, NO,
THAT'S A CHICKEN BONE.

18:59.309 --> 19:01.341
OOH, I FOUND HIM!

19:05.415 --> 19:07.447
HE WAS CURLED UP
INSIDE A BURRITO.

19:10.180 --> 19:12.352
THANKS.

19:12.352 --> 19:17.487
UH, ADAM SIZE PARAMETERS,
SIX-ONE, HUNDRED
AND SEVENTY-FIVE POUNDS.

19:17.487 --> 19:21.361
STRENGTH LEVEL, SIX.
CLOTHING--
YES, PLEASE.

19:27.667 --> 19:32.542
WHOA! CHASE, I JUST HAD
THE MOST AWESOME DREAM.

19:32.542 --> 19:35.575
I WAS A TINY NINJA
IN A LAND OF BUTT GIANTS.

19:35.575 --> 19:38.278
NO, ADAM, THAT
WASN'T A DREAM.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.910
I MADE A MISTAKE
AND SHRUNK YOU.

19:40.910 --> 19:43.583
THAT'S RIGHT!
AND I HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH IT.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.885
FOR ONCE, LEO'S
PART OF THE SOLUTION
TO A PROBLEM

19:45.885 --> 19:48.688
HE DIDN'T CREATE!
YES!

19:49.819 --> 19:53.323
WOW, I THINK I FINALLY
UNDERSTAND WHAT IT FEELS

19:53.323 --> 19:54.694
LIKE TO BE
THE SMALLER BROTHER.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.896
( sighing )
FINALLY!

19:56.896 --> 19:58.668
SO DOES THIS MEAN
THAT YOU'RE NOT
GONNA MAKE SHORT

19:58.668 --> 20:00.500
JOKES AT
MY EXPENSE ANYMORE?

20:00.500 --> 20:03.833
I'M SORRY, CAN YOU
SPEAK UP? I CAN'T
HEAR YOU DOWN THERE.

20:03.833 --> 20:05.835
YOU JUST CANNOT
HELP YOURSELF, CAN YOU?

20:05.835 --> 20:09.239
OH, I'M JUST KIDDING.
LOOK, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE THAT SMALL.

20:09.239 --> 20:11.711
AND FOR TURNING
ME BACK TO NORMAL,
I GOT YOU A GIFT.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.883
OKAY, CLOSE YOUR EYES.

20:17.717 --> 20:18.548
OPEN 'EM.

20:21.251 --> 20:23.393
IT'S A TINY NINJA COSTUME!

20:25.595 --> 20:27.727
OH, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE SIZE.
YOU'LL GROW INTO IT.

20:34.964 --> 20:38.568
UGH, I AM SO
HAPPY TO JUST BE
A STUDENT AGAIN.

20:38.568 --> 20:42.712
AND I AM SO HAPPY YOU'VE
FORGIVEN ME FOR QUITTING
AS VICE PRINCIPAL.

20:42.712 --> 20:44.574
I DIDN'T.

20:44.574 --> 20:46.616
SO WE'RE GOOD?

20:48.017 --> 20:51.551
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
THE FORMER ADMINISTRATION.

20:51.551 --> 20:55.355
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
THE FAILED ADMINISTRATION.

20:55.355 --> 20:59.559
THAT WAS MY DIS!
YOU ONLY CHANGED ONE WORD!

20:59.559 --> 21:02.632
NOW THAT I'M BACK IN
CHARGE, I'M GONNA MAKE
YOUR LIVES MISERABLE.

21:02.632 --> 21:05.565
I THINK YOU MEAN
HER LIFE, BECAUSE
I RESIGNED MY POSITION.

21:05.565 --> 21:07.797
YOU AND ME, ROCK SOLID.

21:09.699 --> 21:10.970
NOT A CHANCE.
YOU TWO ARE GONNA
SPEND THE REST

21:10.970 --> 21:13.272
OF THE DAY CLEANING
UP THE CAFETERIA.

21:14.704 --> 21:18.508
OH, ( laughing )
I DON'T THINK SO.

21:18.508 --> 21:20.580
I MAY NOT BE PRINCIPAL
ANYMORE, BUT, UH,

21:20.580 --> 21:22.682
I DO STILL HAVE ONE THING:

21:22.682 --> 21:23.883
YOUR MOTHER'S PHONE NUMBER.

21:25.755 --> 21:27.957
THERESA!

21:27.957 --> 21:29.889
ON, NO!
NO, MOMMY, NO!

21:29.889 --> 21:32.792
I'VE BEEN A GOOD GIRL!
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

21:32.792 --> 21:34.994
Mother:
THERESA! THERESA!
