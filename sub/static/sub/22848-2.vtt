00:06.089 --> 00:07.298
-[therapist] How are you guys?
-[Andi] Hi.

00:07.382 --> 00:08.925
-[Kyle] Hey.
-[therapist] Hi.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.761
-[therapist] How are you feeling?
-Really good.

00:13.388 --> 00:18.268
Uh, Kyle? Uh, whenever I ask that,
you always look immediately over to Andi.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.562
Is there a reason for that?

00:20.645 --> 00:23.231
Oh, um... [sniffs]

00:25.984 --> 00:32.532
I guess, uh, it was initially
Andi's idea to start coming here,

00:32.615 --> 00:34.743
um, and seeing you, so, um...

00:35.660 --> 00:40.123
I just always then, uh, check in with you
to see how you're feeling.

00:42.667 --> 00:43.668
It's nice.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.379
So, Andi, how are you doing?

00:47.589 --> 00:48.631
[sighs]

00:49.257 --> 00:50.759
I feel ready.

00:50.842 --> 00:56.014
I feel like this has been such
an important part of the process,

00:56.097 --> 00:58.391
as a very, very adult sort of thing to do,

00:58.475 --> 01:02.270
of talking it out
and making it super conscious,

01:02.353 --> 01:06.858
but at a certain point, I feel like
it's getting into a heady zone.

01:06.941 --> 01:12.655
Um, and it just feels so abstract
at this point, and...

01:14.491 --> 01:18.119
it's unanswerable in this room.
Uh, you know?

01:18.203 --> 01:20.830
So I feel like we should just do it.

01:22.582 --> 01:27.045
Well, just so we're all on the same page,
what do you mean by "do it"?

01:27.712 --> 01:29.297
Open marriage.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.510
[Andi chuckles]

01:33.593 --> 01:38.473
Having sex with other people. [chuckles]

01:38.556 --> 01:40.058
Kyle, you look surprised.

01:42.227 --> 01:44.729
I didn't know you were there yet.
I didn't know you were ready.

01:44.813 --> 01:47.690
I didn't know we were
at that moment. [chuckles]

01:48.733 --> 01:50.610
-You okay?
-[chuckles]

01:50.693 --> 01:53.655
Yeah, I'm okay.
I mean, it's a lot to take in.

01:53.738 --> 01:55.657
We hadn't, uh, exactly
discussed that beforehand.

01:55.740 --> 01:58.952
-No, I'm sorry to just drop it like that.
-[chuckles]

01:59.035 --> 02:00.161
-I just...
-Sure.

02:00.245 --> 02:03.498
I like when we're in there
because it makes it safe...

02:03.581 --> 02:06.709
-Yeah.
-to say what-- you know...

02:06.793 --> 02:08.586
Totally. So now what, though?

02:08.670 --> 02:11.548
-We just start?
-[sighs]

02:11.631 --> 02:13.091
Yeah.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.300
-Okay.
-I guess, right?

02:14.384 --> 02:16.678
I guess. I mean,
do we need to set some rules or--

02:16.761 --> 02:19.764
I don't think we need rules.
I feel like we've done the work...

02:19.848 --> 02:20.765
Mm-hmm.

02:20.849 --> 02:25.520
in there and in our life,
and we have so much love, and...

02:27.647 --> 02:30.483
-I feel connected to you.
-Yeah, totally. Me, too.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.778
Um, I guess, I just gotta ask...

02:33.862 --> 02:35.864
Are you now ready to start trying

02:35.947 --> 02:40.952
because there's someone specific
that you wanna try with?

02:41.035 --> 02:44.998
No. No. No. Do you have...

02:45.081 --> 02:49.419
Oh, no, no. No, I mean, there are people
I have little crushes on,

02:49.502 --> 02:51.629
or who I think are hot. But...

02:52.171 --> 02:54.883
-I've got my little list. But...
-Shut up. [groans]

02:54.966 --> 02:57.093
-Oh, my gosh, thank you so much.
-[Kyle] Seriously.

02:57.176 --> 02:59.387
-[man] Not a problem.
-[Andi] Once again saved the day.

02:59.470 --> 03:02.390
[man] I got my butt kicked
in  Sorry!  a couple times.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.350
-[Kyle] Oh, right.
-[Andi] Good, I like to hear that.

03:04.434 --> 03:07.353
-I got schooled. Take it easy, you guys.
-[Kyle] Uh-oh.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.439
-Thank you so much.
-[man] Sure thing.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.483
If you should ever need
extra time or something,

03:12.567 --> 03:14.986
let me know and the kids can
hang out. It's not a problem.

03:15.069 --> 03:16.070
Thanks, Tom.

03:16.154 --> 03:17.780
-No problem.
-I appreciate it so much.

03:17.864 --> 03:18.907
I get it.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.366
-Okay.
-Just let me know, okay?

03:20.450 --> 03:21.868
[Kyle] That's amazing, awesome.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.081
[director] 'Cause this is...

03:27.165 --> 03:30.585
The last time you saw Tony,
he's in a pool of blood.

03:30.668 --> 03:31.920
-[Kyle] Yeah.
-[director] You're processing this.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.088
This is bringing us down
and then you're down here.

03:34.172 --> 03:36.382
I'm just saying, what are you,
a fucking robot?

03:36.466 --> 03:38.801
Tony Pony's dead,
and whose side are you on?

03:38.885 --> 03:39.886
The humans or the suits?

03:39.969 --> 03:44.307
Jesus Christ! Elias, how about
let's just say I'm on both sides, huh?

03:44.390 --> 03:45.975
How about let's just go with that?

03:46.517 --> 03:49.562
Andi? Can I borrow you for a quick sec?

03:49.646 --> 03:52.315
-I don't feel like he's petulant at all.
-[Kyle] Of course.

03:52.398 --> 03:55.985
I feel like, you know,
even a thumbs up and such...

03:56.069 --> 03:58.154
[director] I know you didn't want it
to be really good.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.489
You cut the whole monologue.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.908
I'm not touching that.
I'm out of here.

04:01.991 --> 04:04.327
Great work today. Good job, great work.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.412
Oh, hey, dude. How's it going?

04:08.164 --> 04:09.666
-Hey.
-Oh, hello.

04:09.749 --> 04:13.253
Oh, hello. What, do you got
any weekend plans?

04:13.336 --> 04:17.840
Um, I have...
Well, I have a date on Friday.

04:17.924 --> 04:20.885
-But I think I'm gonna cancel it.
-Why? Tell me everything.

04:20.969 --> 04:23.596
How do I cancel it? [laughs]

04:23.680 --> 04:27.475
Tell him there's some hotshot actor
at the theater you work at [clicks tongue]

04:28.184 --> 04:31.271
-a big Chicago star.
-That's a good idea.

04:31.354 --> 04:34.023
If he's a big fan of the theater,
he'll be very intimidated.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.817
-That's a very good plan.
-Thank you.

04:35.900 --> 04:37.193
I'll say I'm hanging out with you.

04:37.277 --> 04:39.904
Maybe he saw me in
Much Ado About Nothing  last summer.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.614
Are you asking me on a date? [laughs]

04:41.698 --> 04:44.659
[chuckles] Do you wanna come
watch my kids with me?

04:44.742 --> 04:46.077
Yeah, kind of.

04:46.160 --> 04:47.328
Uh, you don't.

04:47.412 --> 04:51.249
Uh... Well, I'm thrilled to be
back here working again.

04:51.332 --> 04:52.917
-It's been a minute.
-Yeah, I know.

04:53.001 --> 04:55.128
Mostly 'cause I get to come in here
and annoy you.

04:55.211 --> 04:56.921
I love it when you come here and annoy me.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.006
Thank you.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.924
-Your turn, Dad.
-[Kyle smacks lips]

05:00.717 --> 05:03.094
Okay,
I'm gonna grab these two white cards,

05:04.345 --> 05:07.932
and that gives me three white cards,

05:08.016 --> 05:11.019
and I can lay some track

05:11.102 --> 05:16.441
-between Nashville and Little Rock.
-[Andi clears throat]

05:16.524 --> 05:17.859
[cell phone chimes]

05:18.776 --> 05:20.570
I can also...

05:25.408 --> 05:26.326
Um...

05:26.409 --> 05:28.953
Actually, that's all I can do.
I'm gonna pass.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.793
-Mom, it's your turn.
-It's your turn.

05:35.877 --> 05:39.338
Okay, okay, okay. Um...

05:42.842 --> 05:44.844
Let me see. I'll take the wild.

05:55.313 --> 05:58.775
[Kyle]   What was going on on your phone
during the board game?

05:58.858 --> 06:02.820
-Oh, um... Possibly.
-Hot date? Setting up a hot date?

06:02.904 --> 06:03.946
-Oh.
-Yeah.

06:04.030 --> 06:07.408
I've been sort of fielding offers.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.202
-[chuckles]
-Mmm.

06:09.285 --> 06:10.953
-Mm-hmm.
-Offers, plural.

06:11.037 --> 06:14.457
Well, you know, once the word gets out
that Andi's avails...

06:14.540 --> 06:16.375
[both laugh]

06:17.627 --> 06:18.878
And what about you?

06:18.961 --> 06:20.797
[inhales sharply] Um...

06:21.339 --> 06:22.965
-Yeah.
-Oh.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.636
-Wow, wow. You're swinging it around.
-Yeah, shit's getting real.

06:26.719 --> 06:27.970
I'll swing it around.

06:28.054 --> 06:31.557
-They can smell it. They know.
-[both chuckle]

06:34.102 --> 06:35.186
I want you.

06:35.937 --> 06:38.481
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm. I want you.

06:38.564 --> 06:41.859
-Oh, yeah? Well, come and get it.
-[both laugh]

06:49.992 --> 06:53.746
We should have opened this up
a long time ago. [laughs]

06:53.830 --> 06:57.041
-Shut up.
-[laughing] Ow!

06:58.209 --> 07:00.503
You dick. [chuckles]

07:00.586 --> 07:03.464
[Andi] What do you think?
Should I cancel the sitter?

07:03.548 --> 07:05.174
-Are you gonna be around?
-Um...

07:05.258 --> 07:08.469
I don't know yet. I don't know what
I'll do after rehearsal tonight.

07:08.553 --> 07:09.971
Can I let you know at lunch?

07:10.054 --> 07:11.848
No. I have to tell her now

07:11.931 --> 07:14.725
because she's gonna
pick them up from school.

07:14.809 --> 07:17.228
-Right. Um... Uh...
-So...

07:17.520 --> 07:20.940
-Then yeah, I think we should confirm.
-Okay.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.651
I'll just get a drink with someone
or something, um,

07:24.235 --> 07:28.156
'cause I don't want to be home alone
with the kids when you're out on a date.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.908
Um... [chuckles]

07:30.992 --> 07:33.161
Are you cool, still?

07:33.244 --> 07:35.580
-Are we...
-Yes, totally cool.

07:35.663 --> 07:36.831
-Okay.
-Absolutely.

07:37.373 --> 07:38.374
Okay, great.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.544
Remind me who this is again.
He's from the ad agency?

07:41.627 --> 07:43.296
-[Andi] Justin...
-[Kyle] Justin, right.

07:43.379 --> 07:46.591
[Andi chuckling] We're gonna have
a little cocktail after work.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.176
[Kyle] Cool.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.146
[bartender] Hi. How are you?

08:00.229 --> 08:02.398
-Hey. Good. How are you?
-I'm well.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.569
-[Kyle] How are you doing, man?
-I feel super behind.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.279
Oh, my God. You're doing great.

08:08.362 --> 08:10.698
How you liking Chicago?
How's it feeling?

08:11.908 --> 08:13.701
-A little lonely.
-Really?

08:13.784 --> 08:16.746
-Yeah. I don't know anyone out here.
-Makes sense.

08:16.829 --> 08:19.290
Uh, you don't wanna grab
some drinks tonight? You got plans?

08:19.373 --> 08:21.334
-No, I got nothing. I'd love it, actually.
-Yeah?

08:21.417 --> 08:23.252
-I could use getting out.
-Get a couple of beers.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.754
-Really.
-Blow off some steam.

08:24.837 --> 08:26.589
-That'd be fun.
-Cool. Let's do it.

08:26.672 --> 08:27.882
Oh. What, now? Great.

08:27.965 --> 08:29.717
-Yeah.
-Good night, guys. Thank you.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.093
-See ya.
-Bye. Good night.

08:31.177 --> 08:33.804
-Let's get off book.
-Trying. Trying.

08:33.888 --> 08:36.140
Hey, Amy!

08:36.224 --> 08:37.767
[Amy laughs]

08:37.850 --> 08:39.936
-Kyle!
-What's up?

08:40.019 --> 08:41.354
-Nothing.
-We're done with the rehearsal,

08:41.437 --> 08:43.481
and Frank and I are gonna
grab some beers.

08:43.564 --> 08:44.565
You wanna come?

08:44.649 --> 08:46.567
[bartender] Drinks on this side,
food on the other.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.778
-Oh.
-It is our happy hour as well.

08:48.861 --> 08:53.241
Um, if I order something here and took it
to the table, would that be okay?

08:53.324 --> 08:55.243
I'll transfer it over, no problem.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.621
-What can I do for you?
-Uh, two vodka sodas and a Hopewell.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.206
-Oh, absolutely.
-Thanks, man.

09:01.999 --> 09:03.417
[sighs]

09:05.920 --> 09:09.382
-How you doing?
-[chuckling] I'm fine. I'm fine.

09:09.465 --> 09:11.133
What are you laughing at?

09:11.217 --> 09:12.843
-I'm losing it.
-Why?

09:13.719 --> 09:18.307
Uh, I'm just-- I'm really nerv--
I'm going--

09:18.391 --> 09:19.517
Uh-huh.

09:19.600 --> 09:25.273
I'm embarking on a date,
and I haven't been on a date in 20 years.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.524
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

09:26.607 --> 09:29.402
-Like a coma situation, or...
-[both chuckle]

09:30.695 --> 09:32.780
Little bit. No, um, I'm married.

09:32.863 --> 09:35.241
I've been married for 100 years, so...

09:35.324 --> 09:38.035
Oh, is this like
a rekindling-your-marriage-type thing?

09:38.119 --> 09:41.831
-Like, with your husband?
-Hmm. Not directly, uh,

09:41.914 --> 09:45.334
but no, we're open. [laughs]

09:46.335 --> 09:48.087
-Like an open marriage?
-Yeah.

09:49.380 --> 09:50.506
Who are you meeting?

09:51.132 --> 09:53.426
-Justin?
-[laughs] Why do you say it like that?

09:53.509 --> 09:56.053
-I don't know.
-Justin. Do you know him?

09:56.137 --> 09:58.306
-I know him, but I don't, like, know him.
-Vodka sodas.

09:58.389 --> 09:59.223
Thanks, man.

09:59.932 --> 10:04.103
-Huh. Good luck with, uh, Justin.
-Thank you.

10:04.186 --> 10:07.106
-[chuckles] Have a good night.
-Good night.

10:07.940 --> 10:11.277
-Hey.
-Oh, my gosh. Hi. How are you?

10:11.360 --> 10:13.321
-Hi. I'm good.
-[chuckles] Oh.

10:13.404 --> 10:14.947
-So good to see you.
-Absolutely.

10:15.031 --> 10:17.199
Do you want to do a table or bar?

10:17.283 --> 10:18.826
I love the bar.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.955
[Amy] Where are the kids tonight?
Are they with Andi, or...

10:23.039 --> 10:25.082
[Kyle] No, we have a sitter watching them.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.752
[Frank] Nice. What you got going on?

10:27.835 --> 10:30.838
-[smacks lips] I got this, bro.
-[Frank] Nice.

10:30.921 --> 10:35.259
She has plans, and I,
uh, just didn't want--

10:35.343 --> 10:37.595
I wanted a night off, didn't want
to take care of the kids again.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.805
-[Frank] Thanks, man.
-Thanks. Uh...

10:39.889 --> 10:40.723
Yeah.

10:42.475 --> 10:46.312
Okay. Let's just, uh... [sniffs]
Why not? Let's get into it. Um...

10:47.521 --> 10:52.693
Andi, my wife, is on a date tonight
with someone.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.572
[stammers] A romantic date?

10:58.032 --> 10:59.325
I think that's the hope.

11:01.243 --> 11:04.580
-[Amy] Uh, does she know that you know?
-Oh, yeah.

11:04.664 --> 11:10.378
We are, um, testing the waters
of having, uh, an open relationship.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.172
A non-monogamous marriage.

11:15.007 --> 11:15.925
Whoa.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.010
-Yeah.
-[imitates explosion]

11:18.094 --> 11:20.638
-[Frank] Yeah. Cool.
-[laughing]

11:20.721 --> 11:22.556
-Did you just start it?
-I hope so.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.266
Yeah, you're literally, uh...

11:24.350 --> 11:27.311
This is... This is night one.

11:27.395 --> 11:28.771
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

11:28.854 --> 11:33.234
We've been together
for a really, really long time, and, uh...

11:33.859 --> 11:37.905
She's my best friend. She's my partner.

11:37.988 --> 11:39.865
She's the mother of my children,

11:39.949 --> 11:43.119
and I think we're
fucking kick-ass parents together.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.704
Um, we have a life. We have a great life.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.124
I mean, last night we had good sex.

11:48.207 --> 11:51.627
But it's just sort of a little less, uh...

11:52.878 --> 11:54.338
alive than it used to be.

11:54.422 --> 11:57.341
Sounds like you're having more sex
than I am. [laughing]

11:57.425 --> 12:00.219
[Kyle] What? Seriously?

12:00.302 --> 12:04.306
Well, I mean, you know,
it's just a quiet moment, but... [laughs]

12:04.390 --> 12:08.602
-Get out of town. Really?
-[Amy] No. Well, yeah. Yeah.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.396
I find that shocking.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.981
No, I mean, it's...

12:12.731 --> 12:15.109
Thanks, but, uh, no.

12:15.192 --> 12:18.362
After my last breakup, I--
At first, it was intentional,

12:18.446 --> 12:21.323
and then it became unintentional
at some point. [chuckles]

12:21.407 --> 12:26.412
I'm sure there are tons of guys
who would love to sleep with you.

12:26.495 --> 12:29.123
-Thanks. Thanks.
-[Frank chuckles]

12:30.499 --> 12:32.793
But... Yeah.

12:33.586 --> 12:34.545
[Kyle] Wow.

12:34.628 --> 12:35.629
-Cheers.
-[Justin] New beginning?

12:35.713 --> 12:37.882
-Something like that, sounds right?
-Sure.

12:37.965 --> 12:39.258
[chuckles]

12:40.718 --> 12:43.637
-[both chuckling]
-It's so on the nose.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.893
Where's your edge, Justin?

12:48.976 --> 12:51.604
Well, it's that or that Irish toast
where it ends with,

12:51.687 --> 12:54.440
"May he hold you in the palm of his hand."
So I thought I'd go, "New beginning."

12:54.523 --> 12:56.484
It sounds like that song, um,

12:56.567 --> 12:59.278
"He will raise you up on eagle's wings."
You know that song?

12:59.361 --> 13:01.864
It's my mother's favorite funeral dirge.

13:01.947 --> 13:05.117
My mother asked me
to sing it at her funeral.

13:05.201 --> 13:07.161
-[both laugh]
-I'm not a singer.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.455
Does it make you uncomfortable
when your parents ask you

13:09.538 --> 13:11.332
-to plan for that kind of stuff?
-Mnh-mnh.

13:11.415 --> 13:13.292
-Oh, that's great. Morbid.
-[both chuckle]

13:13.375 --> 13:15.127
-I'm ready. [chuckles]
-Mnh-mnh.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.046
-[Amy] I hate to leave, but...
-[Frank] You have to go walk a cat?

13:17.129 --> 13:18.547
I'm not walking it, I'm feeding it.

13:18.631 --> 13:21.550
The cat can wait. One more drink
isn't gonna kill the cat.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.177
Do you think you guys will, uh...

13:23.260 --> 13:25.429
Maybe you'll be out for a while
and I'll come back?

13:26.055 --> 13:28.265
-Yeah, go walk the cat and come back.
-[Amy] Okay.

13:29.141 --> 13:32.811
Yeah, if I take care of it,
then I can just... Yeah.

13:32.895 --> 13:34.897
-This is, um...
-[Kyle] Yeah. Right?

13:34.980 --> 13:36.899
-fascinating.
-[Frank] I'm down to drink.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.651
-Okay. Um...
-We'll be here.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.822
-I've got a babysitter.
-[laughs]

13:42.905 --> 13:44.657
-Your wife's not home, okay.
-[Kyle] Yeah.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.826
I gotta go.
See you guys later. [chuckles]

13:56.377 --> 13:57.503
[both laugh]

13:57.586 --> 13:59.171
Um...

13:59.255 --> 14:00.756
Uh, cheers.

14:00.839 --> 14:02.925
-Cheers.
-Holy shit.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.136
Your move.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.723
-What do you mean?
-What are you gonna do?

14:10.850 --> 14:13.102
I'm gonna probably have
another beer with you

14:13.185 --> 14:16.647
and then go home
and relieve the babysitter, and, uh...

14:16.730 --> 14:18.274
And maybe text Amy?

14:19.191 --> 14:20.526
-No.
-Why not?

14:22.486 --> 14:24.947
She more than insinuated she wanted
to hang out later.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.992
I do not think she was interested
in chatting with me.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.618
I want to. I hear that,

14:29.702 --> 14:31.996
but I don't know
if tonight's the night. I think...

14:32.079 --> 14:32.955
That's fair.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.458
You know, I'm a little drunk now,
and like...

14:36.542 --> 14:38.127
I don't know. I'm confused about this.

14:38.210 --> 14:41.213
I actually think I want
something much more anonymous.

14:41.297 --> 14:44.425
I'm not looking
to get into another relationship.

14:44.508 --> 14:47.386
The whole goal of this isn't
to add a second wife.

14:48.053 --> 14:50.514
I just want to fuck a stranger.

14:51.348 --> 14:53.058
That's even easier, man.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.394
Why don't you go downtown
and get a massage?

14:56.854 --> 14:58.230
It's simple. In and out.

14:58.898 --> 15:02.902
You'll relieve some stress.
It's like a baby step. It's like tee-ball.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.947
You mean, like, a happy ending?

15:07.031 --> 15:10.743
Sure. Yeah.
That's a good first step for you.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.455
Is that kind of thing even real?

15:14.997 --> 15:17.166
[chuckles]

15:17.249 --> 15:19.209
-That was fun.
-That was fun.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.669
-Absolutely.
-Yeah.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.962
I'd like to do it again sometime.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.422
-I'll give you a call.
-Okay.

15:23.505 --> 15:25.466
-All right.
-Sounds good.

15:25.549 --> 15:28.218
-I drove, if you need a ride.
-I drove.

15:28.302 --> 15:30.346
-All right.
-Yeah. Thank you, though.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.680
-All right.
-[chuckles]

15:31.764 --> 15:33.432
-Good night.
-Bye. Oh. [chuckles]

15:34.683 --> 15:36.435
-Take care.
-Bye. You, too.

15:37.478 --> 15:39.188
[sighs, clears throat]

15:40.481 --> 15:41.774
Oh.

15:41.857 --> 15:42.942
Hey.

15:43.651 --> 15:44.985
So how'd it go?

15:45.069 --> 15:46.028
Uh...

15:47.112 --> 15:49.448
Not so hot. Can I get a cigarette?

15:49.531 --> 15:50.616
Yes.

15:54.036 --> 15:55.037
Thank you.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.834
-My name's Jason, by the way.
-Oh, hi. I'm Andi.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.586
[chuckles]

16:06.423 --> 16:07.466
[Jason] Mmm.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.054
-Yeah? Do you wanna...
-Come on.

16:12.137 --> 16:13.222
[lighter clicking]

16:14.139 --> 16:16.392
-You got it?
-[laughs] Can't do it.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.935
[lighter clicking]

16:20.854 --> 16:23.732
-It's not working.
-[chuckles] Hold on. I got it.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.151
-All right?
-Mm-hmm.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.613
-Mmm. Thank God!
-Magic touch.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.282
How's everything feeling?

16:33.367 --> 16:36.161
Uh, good. Great. Thank you.

16:38.789 --> 16:39.873
[masseuse] Good.

16:42.001 --> 16:44.128
[sighs] Is this pressure okay?

16:45.004 --> 16:48.382
Yeah. Yep, uh, it's great.

16:49.341 --> 16:53.345
How long have you been working here?

16:53.429 --> 16:54.972
Um, a couple of years.

16:56.557 --> 16:57.558
Wow.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.145
-Brian, can I get the bill, man?
-Oh, absolutely.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.481
[chuckles] Do you, uh... What?

17:05.274 --> 17:06.900
Do you have to know everyone's name?

17:06.984 --> 17:10.029
-I know his name. Thank you.
-That's impressive. Thank you.

17:10.112 --> 17:13.991
Uh, listen. Do you want to get one more,
back at mine?

17:15.534 --> 17:17.870
-Okay. [chuckles]
-Okay.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.165
Um, I have to make a quick call.

17:21.248 --> 17:24.501
I know this is gonna sound crazy,
but I need to call my husband

17:24.585 --> 17:25.544
and let him know

17:25.627 --> 17:27.796
-that I'm gonna be later.
-Right.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.881
I get it.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.800
[both chuckle]

17:38.223 --> 17:39.641
[cell phone buzzing]

17:42.227 --> 17:43.312
Do you need your phone?

17:44.396 --> 17:47.024
No, no, I don't.
Sorry, I should have turned that off.

17:47.107 --> 17:48.150
All of your back is done,

17:48.233 --> 17:49.985
-so you can go ahead and flip over.
-Okay.

17:51.528 --> 17:52.863
Let me just flip.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.451
[grunts]

17:58.160 --> 17:59.078
[sighs]

17:59.161 --> 18:01.955
Do you have a pillow or anything?

18:02.039 --> 18:04.124
Uh, you can scoot down.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.087
Maybe the leg thing?

18:10.881 --> 18:11.757
Here.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.510
-Thanks.
-Is that good?

18:15.594 --> 18:16.929
-That's great.
-Okay.

18:17.012 --> 18:20.224
Um, this is where I offer you a hand job
for $50.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.144
Oh, wow.

18:25.395 --> 18:27.147
-Um...
-It'll be really quick.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.151
[stammers] No, I think, yeah... I...

18:32.277 --> 18:36.907
You're really attractive,
but, uh, I'm married, so...

18:36.990 --> 18:39.701
Okay. Everyone that comes in here
is married.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.995
It's not a big deal.
Don't worry about it.

18:43.038 --> 18:44.206
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.128
Um, hey, uh...

18:50.254 --> 18:52.756
Uh, no, I don't think so. Sorry.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.091
-You sure?
-Yeah.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.345
Okay.

19:03.976 --> 19:04.810
Here.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.186
[beeps]

19:10.107 --> 19:11.608
[elevator beeping]

19:18.615 --> 19:20.075
[Andi giggling]

19:29.501 --> 19:31.003
[Andi laughing]

19:54.776 --> 19:56.069
[cell phone vibrates]

20:08.498 --> 20:10.083
[vibrates]

20:15.339 --> 20:17.591
[Andi breathing heavily]

20:26.475 --> 20:28.060
[both giggle]

20:29.519 --> 20:30.896
[Jason chuckles]

20:36.485 --> 20:37.945
[Andi moaning]

20:46.036 --> 20:47.746
[moaning continues]

20:47.829 --> 20:48.830
Oh, God.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.750
[Andi breathing heavily]

20:55.504 --> 20:57.756
[moaning]

21:11.436 --> 21:13.605
I feel it. I feel it.

21:14.231 --> 21:18.110
[Amy] Careful, you can accidentally get
too high kind of easily, sorry.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.195
-I should have told you first.
-Now you tell me.

21:21.697 --> 21:24.533
-That tastes good. There's a flavor.
-[inhales deeply]

21:25.367 --> 21:26.952
It's like watermelon or something.

21:27.744 --> 21:30.706
Yeah. Maybe a little. [chuckles]

21:30.789 --> 21:32.457
-Maybe a lot.
-[giggling]

21:35.210 --> 21:37.504
-Are you high already?
-No.

21:38.505 --> 21:39.840
You're a little giggly.

21:39.923 --> 21:44.344
I'm not high. [chuckles]
I'm just glad you're here.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.096
Oh, good.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.390
I'm glad I'm here, too.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.386
-What are we doing? [chuckles]
-Uh...

22:28.138 --> 22:29.473
Yeah, um...

22:30.974 --> 22:32.017
All right.

22:34.102 --> 22:37.022
[stammers] I don't know.
I don't know. I...

22:39.733 --> 22:41.276
I mean, we're doing...

22:41.359 --> 22:42.694
-Okay.
-We're doing this.

22:42.778 --> 22:45.363
If you're not okay, I totally understand.

22:45.447 --> 22:48.492
-I'm okay.
-This is brand-new for me.

22:48.575 --> 22:49.868
-I think I understand.
-Right?

22:49.951 --> 22:52.079
And this is the first time.

22:53.830 --> 22:56.500
This is the first time, so I don't know.

22:59.169 --> 23:01.546
If you're asking what's gonna--

23:01.630 --> 23:03.924
What happens tomorrow...

23:05.342 --> 23:06.927
it's a good question.

23:16.937 --> 23:19.648
[Andi moaning]

23:19.731 --> 23:22.275
[grunting, panting]

23:28.323 --> 23:30.033
[grunting]

23:38.041 --> 23:41.128
[both breathing heavily]

24:08.530 --> 24:10.407
[door opens and closes]

24:13.368 --> 24:14.953
[water running]

24:29.176 --> 24:34.139
Um, I don't think I wanna have sex
with you tonight.

24:35.682 --> 24:39.811
Yeah.
Totally, I wasn't thinking that we would.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.229
Oh, okay. [chuckles]

24:41.313 --> 24:43.648
I don't want to have sex with you tonight.

24:44.399 --> 24:45.901
-Okay.
-Great.

24:46.526 --> 24:47.360
Great.

24:48.069 --> 24:50.989
-But can we keep doing other stuff?
-Yeah.

24:51.114 --> 24:52.782
[both chuckle]

24:59.289 --> 25:00.874
Want to get under the covers?

25:02.042 --> 25:03.376
Yeah. Sure.

25:03.460 --> 25:06.254
-Sorry. It's cold. [chuckles]
-It's cold in Chicago.

25:11.468 --> 25:12.302
[Kyle] Is this okay?

25:14.930 --> 25:16.723
-You sure?
-Mm-hmm.

25:27.484 --> 25:28.526
[gasps]

25:32.989 --> 25:35.200
-[Kyle] All right?
-Mm-hmm.

25:37.160 --> 25:38.578
[Kyle grunting]

25:44.167 --> 25:45.335
Oh, fuck.

25:48.088 --> 25:50.340
-Is this okay?
-Um, you know what?

25:51.716 --> 25:55.887
I'm actually-- I'm really good
to just take it slow.

25:57.806 --> 25:58.640
Okay.

25:59.766 --> 26:01.017
[Kyle sighs]

26:01.559 --> 26:03.061
-You sure?
-Yeah.

26:04.062 --> 26:05.146
All right.

26:06.314 --> 26:09.609
-Is that okay?
-It's probably very wise.

26:12.362 --> 26:13.655
[Kyle sighing]

26:16.366 --> 26:18.201
-Don't get me wrong.
-[chuckling]

26:19.286 --> 26:21.037
I want to, just...

26:22.455 --> 26:24.165
one step at a time, you know?

26:34.175 --> 26:35.427
[Kyle sighs]

26:39.889 --> 26:41.725
-Well, this was fun.
-Thank you. [chuckles]

26:41.808 --> 26:43.435
-You all right?
-Yes, thank you.

26:43.518 --> 26:44.519
Get home safe.

26:45.353 --> 26:47.480
-Okay. Bye.
-Bye.

27:37.530 --> 27:38.531
Hey.

27:40.116 --> 27:40.950
Hey.

27:42.410 --> 27:43.912
Sorry I woke you.

27:43.995 --> 27:45.080
You didn't.

27:46.122 --> 27:48.708
-No? [chuckles]
-Will you get over here, please?

27:48.792 --> 27:52.670
-I missed you. [sighs]
-Hey. I missed you.

27:52.754 --> 27:54.881
-Oh.
-[grunts]

27:55.632 --> 27:57.258
Oh, my God.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.551
Yeah. Get in there.

27:58.635 --> 27:59.677
Yes.

28:01.137 --> 28:02.305
[both sigh]

28:04.265 --> 28:05.350
[Kyle] Hmm.

28:06.893 --> 28:08.186
[sighs]

28:12.315 --> 28:14.275
-Did you have fun?
-[chuckles]

28:14.359 --> 28:16.903
It was weird.

28:16.986 --> 28:19.364
Hmm. I had a weird night, too.

28:20.198 --> 28:21.241
Why?

28:23.368 --> 28:25.203
I hooked up with that girl from work.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.207
[chuckles] Wow.

28:29.290 --> 28:30.291
Yeah.

28:31.876 --> 28:36.464
I had sex with a stranger.

28:39.092 --> 28:40.009
Wow.

28:44.472 --> 28:45.932
Do you want to talk about it?

28:46.015 --> 28:47.892
[groans] No.

28:48.893 --> 28:51.062
-Not now.
-[both chuckle]

28:51.146 --> 28:52.939
-Maybe in the morning.
-Cool.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.608
[Andi sighs]

28:55.692 --> 28:58.069
-I love you.
-I love you.

29:00.155 --> 29:02.699
[sighs] I love you.

29:05.535 --> 29:07.036
[both chuckle]

29:10.623 --> 29:11.916
[Andi] Mmm.

29:14.252 --> 29:15.295
[sighs]
