Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:03.902 --> 00:06.496
For over a century,
I have lived in secret. Until now.

00:06.672 --> 00:08.537
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

00:08.707 --> 00:10.675
Elena. She's a dead ringer
for Katherine.

00:10.843 --> 00:13.073
- What are you?
- I'm a vampire.

00:13.312 --> 00:15.872
I've been 17 years old since 1864.

00:16.081 --> 00:19.312
I promise I will keep your secret,
but I can't be with you, Stefan.

00:19.485 --> 00:22.147
- Five bodies all drained of blood.
- They've come back.

00:22.321 --> 00:24.186
- Hello, brother.
- Damon.

00:25.691 --> 00:27.158
She's transitioning.

00:27.326 --> 00:28.486
- Into what?
- A vampire.

00:28.660 --> 00:30.059
Vicki, what the hell?

00:31.330 --> 00:34.094
- Why does everybody die on me
- Can you make him forget?

00:34.299 --> 00:36.927
- What do you want him to know?
- That Vicki left town.

00:37.102 --> 00:40.401
He's gonna miss her,
but he knows it's for the best.

01:39.631 --> 01:41.292
Damon?

01:51.643 --> 01:53.406
Lexi?

01:55.180 --> 01:56.613
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

01:57.282 --> 01:59.648
How could you even ask that?

02:00.119 --> 02:01.677
I missed you.

02:02.921 --> 02:04.513
Happy birthday.

02:13.165 --> 02:15.156
Stop. I don't know, okay?

02:15.334 --> 02:18.667
If some freak shot at me with
wooden bullets, I'd bail in under 60.

02:18.837 --> 02:21.328
And why is a news reporter
hunting vampires?

02:21.507 --> 02:24.533
I don't know who knows about us.
That guy did. There could be others.

02:24.710 --> 02:26.940
Hey, do me a favor?
While you're here, please be careful.

02:27.112 --> 02:29.103
Ugh! Why stay?

02:29.314 --> 02:31.612
I'm headed to New York
for the weekend.

02:31.783 --> 02:33.478
Bon Jovi, in The Garden.

02:33.652 --> 02:36.621
"Wanted Dead or Alive."
It's our theme song.

02:37.055 --> 02:38.317
It'll be a blast.

02:38.524 --> 02:41.015
Hey, do you think
that he would actually remember us?

02:41.193 --> 02:42.990
That was a pretty crazy
weekend, huh?

02:43.195 --> 02:45.356
We can make him remember us.

02:45.564 --> 02:49.694
Come on. Let's go.
I mean, what's keeping you here?

02:49.868 --> 02:52.496
I told you. Her name is Elena.

02:52.704 --> 02:56.834
Well, let's hope she's better
than the last girl you got all sprung over.

02:57.009 --> 02:58.636
You didn't even know Katherine.

02:58.810 --> 03:01.244
Because if I did I'd kick her ass,
the little bitch.

03:01.446 --> 03:03.971
Speaking of, where's Damon?

03:04.183 --> 03:06.845
- Inflicting misery somewhere.
- Uh-huh.

03:07.019 --> 03:10.648
Hey, you gonna be okay here? Alone?
I got some things I gotta take care of.

03:10.822 --> 03:13.154
Well, it's not exactly
like I can go anywhere.

03:13.358 --> 03:17.658
And you and Damon are the only ones
with these nifty little daylight rings.

03:17.863 --> 03:20.661
I have a mood ring from '75.
Trade you?

03:21.200 --> 03:23.361
Doesn't work that way
and you know it.

03:23.569 --> 03:25.696
- Yeah.
- Hey, Lex.

03:25.871 --> 03:29.398
- I'm really glad that you came here.
- What are we doing for your birthday?

03:29.575 --> 03:34.376
It's not every day
a guy turns 162 years old.

03:35.013 --> 03:37.607
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

03:38.884 --> 03:41.910
- Where did Vicki say she was going?
- She didn't.

03:42.087 --> 03:44.248
Did she tell her brother
where she was going?

03:44.489 --> 03:45.786
No, she didn't say anything.

03:45.991 --> 03:48.016
She told Jeremy to tell me
she was leaving.

03:48.193 --> 03:50.684
Is there anyone that may know
what happened to her...

03:50.862 --> 03:52.352
...prior to her leaving town?

03:52.564 --> 03:56.193
Stefan Salvatore may know. He came
to see her but she wouldn't talk to him.

03:56.368 --> 03:58.268
- What was he doing?
- Trying to help her.

03:58.437 --> 04:02.134
I knew Elena was worried about
her brother and he was dating Vicki...

04:02.307 --> 04:04.707
...and she had a drug problem,
so I tried to help.

04:04.910 --> 04:06.901
You got involved
because Elena asked you to?

04:07.079 --> 04:08.307
I asked Stefan to help.

04:08.547 --> 04:11.710
I thought that by helping Vicki,
he was helping my brother.

04:11.883 --> 04:14.716
What was her behavior like
those last days before she left?

04:14.886 --> 04:17.753
Up and down. Very sketchy.

04:17.923 --> 04:21.051
Like she was coming down
from some major partying.

04:21.226 --> 04:23.387
Any signs of aggression or violence?

04:23.829 --> 04:25.023
Not that I remember.

04:25.230 --> 04:26.561
- No.
- No.

04:26.765 --> 04:29.427
So you believe
Vicki really has left town?

04:30.302 --> 04:32.099
- Yes.
- Yes.

04:32.304 --> 04:35.296
- Yes.
- I'll miss her...

04:35.474 --> 04:37.840
...but I think it's for the best.

04:49.121 --> 04:52.579
I was trying to help her, Matt.
That's all.

04:58.997 --> 05:01.830
- I'll meet you guys at the car.
- Okay.

05:08.573 --> 05:09.597
You okay?

05:09.775 --> 05:12.107
I don't think
the sheriff suspected anything.

05:12.277 --> 05:13.574
Jeremy had no memory at all.

05:13.745 --> 05:15.770
All he knew
was what Damon made him know.

05:17.883 --> 05:19.180
Thank you.

05:20.085 --> 05:21.609
I can't do this, Stefan.

05:22.354 --> 05:24.288
Every time I look at Matt or Jeremy...

05:24.456 --> 05:27.789
...all I think is that
Vicki is never gonna come back.

05:28.593 --> 05:30.322
And they'll never know why.

05:30.495 --> 05:33.123
Around you, people get hurt
and people die and I just...

05:33.298 --> 05:35.596
I can't. It's just too much.

05:35.767 --> 05:38.736
- Why don't we go and talk about it?
- No.

05:39.137 --> 05:42.197
Stefan, you have to stay away
from me.

05:52.751 --> 05:55.413
- Boo.
- Ugh.

05:57.222 --> 05:59.019
Hello, Lexi.

05:59.191 --> 06:01.489
What an unexpected surprise.

06:02.160 --> 06:04.526
"Unexpected surprise"?

06:04.696 --> 06:06.823
The wrong brother
went back to high school.

06:07.032 --> 06:09.762
- How long you here for?
- Just for Stefan's b-day.

06:10.001 --> 06:12.265
You mean you didn't come all this way
to see me?

06:12.437 --> 06:14.405
That's it, Damon. After a century...

06:14.573 --> 06:18.339
...I finally realized death means nothing
without you.

06:18.510 --> 06:19.534
Do me.

06:20.145 --> 06:23.376
Oh, why are you so mean to me?

06:24.015 --> 06:26.245
Have you met you?
You're not a nice person.

06:26.451 --> 06:29.909
- Well, because I'm a vampire.
- But you're only the bad parts.

06:30.722 --> 06:31.950
Teach me to be good.

06:32.891 --> 06:34.756
I'm older and that means stronger.

06:34.960 --> 06:37.758
- I'm sorry.
- Don't ruin my time with Stefan.

06:37.963 --> 06:39.396
Because I'll hurt you.

06:39.598 --> 06:41.589
- And you know I can do it.
- Yeah.

06:53.044 --> 06:54.477
You leaving?

06:54.679 --> 06:56.806
Dad doesn't like it
when I stay here too much.

06:56.982 --> 06:59.815
Because he misses you
or because he doesn't trust me?

07:00.051 --> 07:02.611
Your father's problem is
he lacks imagination.

07:02.788 --> 07:06.315
He thinks I'll fill your head
with all my witchy juju.

07:06.558 --> 07:08.219
- He's right.
- He's always right.

07:08.427 --> 07:10.088
That's his other problem.

07:11.763 --> 07:13.287
You need to be wearing that.

07:13.465 --> 07:15.865
I gotta get it to Caroline.
It doesn't belong to me.

07:16.034 --> 07:18.366
It does. It was your ancestor's
and now it's yours.

07:18.537 --> 07:21.062
Emily was your ancestor too.
Why don't you wear it?

07:21.273 --> 07:24.606
It didn't find me, it found you.
Protected you.

07:24.810 --> 07:27.574
A witch's talisman is a powerful tool.

07:27.746 --> 07:30.715
Don't be giving that back to anybody.

07:30.916 --> 07:32.315
Okay.

07:37.489 --> 07:39.719
I just wish it was prettier.

07:43.728 --> 07:46.993
- You're wallowing.
- So are you.

07:47.165 --> 07:49.656
My wallow is legitimate.
I was dumped.

07:49.868 --> 07:51.233
Yeah, well, Logan's a jerk.

07:51.403 --> 07:55.806
You didn't get a brush-off e-mail saying,
"I'm leaving town. See you."

07:55.974 --> 07:57.441
Wanna keep it down over there?

07:57.642 --> 07:59.735
- Why? What are you doing?
- Homework.

08:01.146 --> 08:02.613
Since when do you do homework?

08:02.781 --> 08:07.980
I gotta finish this. I'm way behind
and I have a quiz tomorrow, so...

08:09.521 --> 08:12.456
What do you think? Alien?

08:12.624 --> 08:14.785
Some sort of replicant.

08:14.960 --> 08:16.951
He can hear you.

08:22.834 --> 08:24.324
Yeah?

08:24.669 --> 08:26.000
Send him in.

08:28.073 --> 08:30.200
Mr. Salvatore. Come on in.

08:30.408 --> 08:32.273
- Could you get the door for me?
- Sure.

08:32.477 --> 08:36.140
I understand from Mrs. Lockwood
that your uncle's out of town.

08:36.313 --> 08:39.909
Yes, he is, but I spoke with Zach
and he filled me in...

08:40.085 --> 08:43.577
...and asked if I could bring this to you.

08:54.366 --> 08:56.266
- Vervain.
- It's all we have at the moment.

08:56.434 --> 08:58.231
I hope it's enough.

09:03.241 --> 09:04.538
It's a small circle.

09:05.043 --> 09:07.307
Founding families, a few city officials.

09:07.512 --> 09:10.003
And your deputies, of course, right?

09:12.017 --> 09:13.245
Are we any closer?

09:14.352 --> 09:16.183
I think our facts are wrong.

09:17.022 --> 09:20.856
We've always believed that vampires
can only come out in the dark.

09:21.059 --> 09:24.051
- What if that's changed?
- So is that even possible?

09:24.229 --> 09:26.129
We've exhausted every other option.

09:26.331 --> 09:29.732
We have to consider the vampire
may be walking around during the day...

09:29.901 --> 09:32.199
...right in front of us.

09:36.575 --> 09:37.872
So, what's the next step?

09:38.043 --> 09:42.139
We're now looking at anyone
new to town since the deaths began.

09:42.347 --> 09:43.939
Should turn up a suspect or two.

09:44.115 --> 09:46.982
And I, of course,
will do anything I can to help.

09:55.493 --> 09:57.120
You up?

09:58.096 --> 09:59.654
No.

10:03.168 --> 10:04.465
No, no.

10:04.636 --> 10:06.797
Why haven't you called me back?

10:07.172 --> 10:08.400
I'm sorry.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.802
- Are you gonna stay in there forever?
- Yep.

10:12.310 --> 10:13.470
Move over.

10:19.618 --> 10:21.108
I'm officially worried.

10:22.087 --> 10:23.645
What's going on?

10:25.190 --> 10:29.320
I'm tired of thinking, of talking.

10:29.494 --> 10:32.520
Can I get a one-line version
so I can pretend to be helpful?

10:32.764 --> 10:34.823
Stefan and I broke up.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.833
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

10:38.003 --> 10:40.665
Right. Stupid question.

10:41.673 --> 10:46.406
I know I've been kind of MIA
when you need me the most.

10:46.911 --> 10:48.105
I suck.

10:48.313 --> 10:50.213
You wanna make it up to me?

10:50.448 --> 10:52.439
Get my mind off of it.

10:54.986 --> 10:56.476
Just remember you asked for it.

11:07.432 --> 11:08.831
Hey.

11:11.202 --> 11:14.467
- Be patient.
- Okay.

11:15.507 --> 11:17.031
I need to swear you to secrecy.

11:17.509 --> 11:19.374
It's a bad week for that kind of stuff.

11:19.544 --> 11:21.705
Swear. I'm not supposed
to be showing this.

11:21.946 --> 11:23.174
- Okay. I swear.
- Okay.

11:23.348 --> 11:25.509
There's no windows open, right?

11:25.684 --> 11:27.948
- Right.
- There's no fan, no air conditioning.

11:28.119 --> 11:29.677
None. What are you doing?

11:29.854 --> 11:33.017
Grams just showed me this.
You're gonna love it.

11:33.191 --> 11:34.852
You ready?

11:51.910 --> 11:53.673
Bonnie, what's going on?

12:21.206 --> 12:25.074
It's true, Elena.
Everything my grams told me.

12:25.243 --> 12:28.610
It's impossible, and it's true.

12:29.781 --> 12:31.806
I'm a witch.

12:34.219 --> 12:36.380
I believe you.

12:44.963 --> 12:48.228
Look, dungeon boy,
I'm done being your little slave girl.

12:48.733 --> 12:52.396
You seriously hurt me
and I will be damned if you think...

12:54.239 --> 12:57.766
Oh, my God, where have you been?

12:57.942 --> 12:59.967
- It's really good to see you.
- Much better.

13:00.612 --> 13:02.978
You wanna throw a party
here at the Grill tonight.

13:03.815 --> 13:05.077
Why don't you do it?

13:05.250 --> 13:07.275
Because then Stefan
and his BFF won't come.

13:07.485 --> 13:09.953
I need a lot of people. Big crowd.
Invite everyone.

13:10.555 --> 13:12.079
And why am I having this party?

13:12.257 --> 13:16.159
Because you are gonna help me solve
this town's little vampire problem.

13:16.861 --> 13:18.294
And I want my crystal back.

13:18.997 --> 13:20.294
Oh, but Bonnie has it.

13:20.865 --> 13:23.698
I know that. Get it from her.

13:26.204 --> 13:29.696
So this Elena girl.
She'll come around. I'm sure of it.

13:30.208 --> 13:31.937
- Have you had sex yet?
- No.

13:32.110 --> 13:33.771
Sex always works.

13:33.945 --> 13:37.472
You'll rock her world so hard with
your vamp sex, she'll be yours forever.

13:37.649 --> 13:41.608
Yeah, but see, this isn't about
sex or compulsion...

13:41.786 --> 13:43.651
...or any of our other tricks.

13:43.822 --> 13:47.121
She has to want to be with me,
on her own terms.

13:47.292 --> 13:50.125
Wow. That sounded all mature
and grown-up.

13:50.328 --> 13:51.989
Well, I'm not getting any older.

14:01.806 --> 14:05.173
- Want some?
- No, thank you.

14:05.343 --> 14:07.402
Relax. I didn't kill anyone for it.

14:07.645 --> 14:11.103
This phlebotomist I went out with
a few times, he's my supplier.

14:12.183 --> 14:13.741
Oh, don't judge, okay?

14:13.918 --> 14:16.910
Listen, I tried the animal diet,
lasted three weeks.

14:17.121 --> 14:20.215
Doesn't matter. If I started again,
I would just... I don't know.

14:20.391 --> 14:22.256
You could stop.

14:25.029 --> 14:27.020
Lexi, I'd never judge you.

14:27.198 --> 14:29.132
I'm just jealous of your restraint.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.996
I have none. I delight in hedonism.

14:32.203 --> 14:35.434
Speaking of which,
what are we doing tonight?

14:35.673 --> 14:39.234
- Funny you should ask.
- Well, I wasn't asking you.

14:39.410 --> 14:41.571
There's a party. At the Grill.
You'll love it.

14:42.046 --> 14:45.174
Banquettes, tacky wait staff.
All of Stefan's friends.

14:45.350 --> 14:47.944
- Yeah, I don't want a birthday party.
- It's not for you.

14:48.186 --> 14:51.087
It's a "party" party.
No one's gonna know it's your birthday.

14:51.656 --> 14:54.386
- Caroline's throwing it.
- Damon, stay away from Caroline.

14:54.559 --> 14:55.753
We're friends. It's cool.

14:55.927 --> 14:59.590
It's important for the town to see us
out and about like normal folk.

14:59.764 --> 15:01.163
We need to blend.

15:04.135 --> 15:05.602
Ugh.

15:05.770 --> 15:08.170
I prefer mine at 98.6.

15:12.310 --> 15:14.175
Let's go.

15:16.481 --> 15:18.278
Please?

15:18.449 --> 15:22.283
It's weird, huh? After all this time
joking about being psychic...

15:22.453 --> 15:24.421
...I really am a witch.

15:26.925 --> 15:29.120
You don't think
I'm a freak now, do you?

15:29.294 --> 15:30.454
No, of course not.

15:31.095 --> 15:33.120
Bonnie, I just...
I don't understand, though.

15:33.298 --> 15:36.699
If your grams asked you to keep this
a secret, why did you tell me?

15:36.901 --> 15:40.564
You're my best friend.
I can't keep secrets from you.

15:45.843 --> 15:46.901
I'm almost ready.

15:47.078 --> 15:49.740
I can't believe you think
that we should go to this thing.

15:49.914 --> 15:52.849
It's not like I'm asking you to run
outside, midday, without your ring.

15:53.017 --> 15:56.976
- I mean, seriously, it's a party.
- A party that Damon wants us to go to.

15:57.221 --> 15:59.781
So my question is, why?
I think he's up to something.

15:59.991 --> 16:03.654
Who cares? What can he possibly do
in front of people in a public place?

16:03.828 --> 16:06.262
He knows how to keep a low profile.
Believe me.

16:06.431 --> 16:08.626
Okay, so he'll behave.

16:08.800 --> 16:10.995
Come on. One day a year I get you.

16:11.235 --> 16:15.262
One day that you're not brooding
and existing in your own head.

16:16.107 --> 16:17.836
- It's my birthday, huh?
- It's my day.

16:18.009 --> 16:20.807
And that guy that jumped naked
in the Trevi Fountain...

16:20.979 --> 16:24.039
...and got drunk on the torch
of the Statue of Liberty?

16:24.282 --> 16:27.479
That guy can take a break
from all of his worrying for one night...

16:27.652 --> 16:29.381
...and go to a stupid party.

16:29.554 --> 16:33.183
So quit your whining
and go get ready.

16:35.994 --> 16:37.188
Fine.

16:52.377 --> 16:55.073
It's open. Come on in.

17:02.053 --> 17:04.078
Oh, my God.

17:04.888 --> 17:06.220
How...? Uh...

17:09.527 --> 17:11.290
- Who...?
- I'm Elena.

17:13.330 --> 17:14.457
Who are you?

17:14.632 --> 17:17.430
Lexi. A friend of Stefan's.

17:19.170 --> 17:22.696
- Is he here?
- He's in the shower.

17:23.107 --> 17:25.666
- Do you wanna wait?
- No.

17:26.711 --> 17:30.579
- I'll tell him you stopped by.
- That's okay.

17:36.521 --> 17:38.921
Are you out of your freaking mind?

17:39.390 --> 17:41.119
What are you talking about?

17:42.460 --> 17:44.325
I just met Elena.

17:46.230 --> 17:49.461
You have some serious explaining
to do.

17:55.773 --> 17:57.604
You have some serious
emotional damage.

17:57.775 --> 18:00.141
No, it's not what you think.
She's not Katherine.

18:00.344 --> 18:02.710
Then they're related
because they could be twins.

18:03.147 --> 18:04.842
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

18:05.049 --> 18:07.950
- You didn't find out?
- No, maybe I don't wanna know.

18:08.119 --> 18:10.883
I have no desire
to tie Elena to Katherine.

18:11.789 --> 18:17.728
Okay, yes, yes, the resemblance
is what drew me in, but that's it.

18:17.929 --> 18:21.421
Katherine and Elena
may look the same on the outside...

18:21.599 --> 18:24.090
...but on the inside
they are completely different.

18:24.268 --> 18:27.760
Oh, so Elena's not a raging bitch,
then, huh?

18:28.973 --> 18:30.304
No.

18:30.475 --> 18:32.773
No, Elena is...

18:34.479 --> 18:38.813
Elena's warm and she's kind.

18:38.983 --> 18:42.441
And she's caring and she's selfless.

18:43.187 --> 18:44.984
And it's real.

18:45.590 --> 18:51.790
And, honestly, when I'm around her,
I completely forget what I am.

18:52.196 --> 18:54.255
Oh, my God.

18:54.899 --> 18:56.196
You're in love with her.

19:00.838 --> 19:05.468
- Yeah. Now I am.
- Wow.

19:16.053 --> 19:17.782
Rushes in

19:17.955 --> 19:19.684
Here to stay

19:19.857 --> 19:21.518
Rushes in

19:22.160 --> 19:23.184
You are here to stay

19:23.361 --> 19:26.660
Rushes in to
My heart and my soul

19:26.831 --> 19:29.197
I can't control
Think about it

19:29.367 --> 19:31.562
Amazing party, right?

19:31.802 --> 19:33.064
Glad you thought of it.

19:34.672 --> 19:36.799
Are you having a good time?

19:36.974 --> 19:39.374
- Do you have my crystal?
- No.

19:40.344 --> 19:41.868
Then I'm not having a good time.

19:53.524 --> 19:55.822
- Where's my brother?
- He said he'd meet me here.

19:55.993 --> 19:57.688
Buy you a?

20:02.600 --> 20:04.067
Hey.

20:04.835 --> 20:06.564
What are you doing here?

20:06.737 --> 20:10.696
Lexi said that you came by
and you seemed upset.

20:11.709 --> 20:14.610
Right. The girl in the towel.

20:15.413 --> 20:17.472
- The towel?
- Mm-hm.

20:18.749 --> 20:21.547
Oh, no, no. No, no, no.

20:22.220 --> 20:26.350
Not like that, no.
She's not exactly a girl. Lexi's, um...

20:26.524 --> 20:28.549
She's 350 years old.

20:29.427 --> 20:30.485
You means she's a...?

20:31.229 --> 20:32.753
And she's my oldest friend.

20:32.930 --> 20:36.593
Nothing romantic. Ever.

20:37.902 --> 20:42.032
Oh. Okay, well, she kept staring at me.

20:42.206 --> 20:44.265
It was weird.

20:45.042 --> 20:47.704
Well, you know,
I've talked about you. A lot.

20:47.912 --> 20:51.643
So guess she felt like she knew you.

20:54.252 --> 20:55.742
So why'd you come by?

20:57.221 --> 20:59.246
I, uh...

20:59.724 --> 21:01.248
It was a mistake.

21:04.795 --> 21:07.730
- Elena, talk to me.
- I can't.

21:09.433 --> 21:11.958
Stefan, I can't,
and that's the problem.

21:12.169 --> 21:16.333
I'm keeping these secrets from everyone.
I can't even tell my best friend.

21:16.574 --> 21:18.405
Do you know how hard that is?

21:18.943 --> 21:23.039
It's like I need to talk to someone
but the only person I can talk to is...

21:23.214 --> 21:25.739
...you and...

21:29.053 --> 21:31.283
I want you to know...

21:31.656 --> 21:35.490
...that I will always be here for you.

21:35.693 --> 21:39.686
You can come to me
about anything, okay?

21:42.300 --> 21:45.326
Well, thank you for coming by.

21:53.377 --> 21:57.211
Hey, do you need a ride
to the Grill tonight?

21:57.448 --> 21:59.507
Are you going to Caroline's party?

21:59.717 --> 22:01.446
Lexi's dragging me.

22:02.486 --> 22:05.353
And it's my birthday.

22:07.291 --> 22:08.815
Really?

22:09.126 --> 22:10.457
Wow. Um...

22:10.628 --> 22:13.688
- Happy birthday, then.
- Thank you.

22:14.365 --> 22:19.496
Actually, I think
I'm gonna stay in tonight.

22:22.540 --> 22:23.598
Okay.

22:28.312 --> 22:31.179
Well, have a good night.

22:44.228 --> 22:46.128
I don't wanna deny

22:49.800 --> 22:52.667
Bonnie. Hey, I've been looking for you.

22:52.837 --> 22:55.863
I'm totally sorry to do this.
I know it's so Indian giver...

22:56.040 --> 22:58.873
...and I know we're not even supposed
to say that anymore.

22:59.076 --> 23:02.842
- But I need my crystal back.
- Why? You said you hated it.

23:03.013 --> 23:06.574
But then I saw it on you
and I realized how great it is.

23:06.751 --> 23:09.845
And I've got, like, three outfits
I can coordinate it with, so...

23:10.020 --> 23:12.215
I can't give it back to you.

23:12.957 --> 23:18.418
Okay. Well, I didn't wanna have
to tell you this, but I'm your friend.

23:18.596 --> 23:21.224
When you wear it,
it makes you look fat.

23:21.432 --> 23:24.196
There, I said it.
But it's because I'm your friend, so...

23:24.368 --> 23:26.529
I'm sorry. Caroline, I can't.

23:27.438 --> 23:30.407
Well, what do you mean
that you can't, Bonnie? It's mine.

23:30.608 --> 23:32.405
- You said it was Damon's.
- It is...

23:32.610 --> 23:34.578
So he's the one
who really wants it back.

23:34.745 --> 23:36.406
No.

23:36.981 --> 23:38.414
Maybe it just...

23:39.750 --> 23:40.876
Ow!

23:41.385 --> 23:42.613
Are you wearing polyester?

23:42.787 --> 23:45.278
You were really gonna pull it
from my neck?

23:46.290 --> 23:48.758
What the hell is wrong with you?

24:01.439 --> 24:02.906
Matt.

24:06.110 --> 24:08.010
Just hear me out, please?

24:08.212 --> 24:10.476
I was just trying to help Vicki.

24:10.714 --> 24:13.774
I went through something similar once.

24:15.986 --> 24:17.010
I'm really sorry.

24:18.656 --> 24:21.989
Don't be.
It's not the first time she's run off.

24:22.526 --> 24:26.462
Turns out Vicki's just like her mother.
I can't count on either of them.

24:28.966 --> 24:30.797
Thanks for trying.

24:38.175 --> 24:39.506
Where is it?

24:39.677 --> 24:42.373
- Bonnie won't give it to me.
- So rip it off her neck.

24:42.546 --> 24:45.447
Well, I tried. It shocked me.

24:45.649 --> 24:48.482
Damn it. Why does it do that?

24:48.652 --> 24:51.746
- I need that crystal.
- Why are you being like this?

24:51.956 --> 24:54.789
I'm so good to you
and I'd do anything.

24:54.959 --> 24:58.258
You know,
it's just some stupid necklace.

24:58.896 --> 25:01.558
No, you are the only stupid thing here.

25:02.032 --> 25:03.829
And shallow.

25:04.535 --> 25:07.197
And useless.

25:11.141 --> 25:13.473
Okay, I'm gonna need
a little more foot movement.

25:13.644 --> 25:16.408
I'm not really interested
in making a fool out of myself.

25:16.580 --> 25:19.481
- Come on, you're not that bad.
- Just do me a favor.

25:19.650 --> 25:21.880
Tell me if you see Damon
with his camera phone.

25:22.052 --> 25:24.179
- Right.
- Yeah.

25:29.326 --> 25:31.226
- Hey.
- Where are we going?

25:31.395 --> 25:34.660
- No one's gonna see us down here.
- Are you gonna go outside?

25:56.086 --> 25:57.246
Did you hear something?

25:57.421 --> 26:00.322
No, it's cool.
There's no one coming down here.

26:15.172 --> 26:16.662
- Whoo.
- Nice.

26:18.675 --> 26:21.007
Only in my dreams
Because they're all I know

26:23.447 --> 26:26.610
Cruisin' through the city
On a bullet train

26:26.783 --> 26:29.616
Dove into the depths
Of the deepest sea

26:29.786 --> 26:32.949
I know I can't swim
That's the funny thing

26:33.123 --> 26:35.921
Only in my dreams
Only in my dreams

26:36.093 --> 26:39.324
Only in my dreams
Only in my dreams

26:41.098 --> 26:44.499
Stefan smiles. Alert the media.

26:44.668 --> 26:47.466
You haven't given him a lot of reasons
to be happy lately.

26:47.638 --> 26:50.630
No, you're right. Poor Stefan.

26:50.841 --> 26:55.210
Persecuted throughout eternity
by his depraved brother.

26:57.948 --> 27:01.179
Does it get tiring, being so righteous?

27:01.351 --> 27:04.013
It flares up in the presence
of psychopaths.

27:04.187 --> 27:07.281
Ouch. Well, consider this psychopath's
feelings hurt.

27:09.226 --> 27:12.662
- What did you do to my brother?
- I'm gonna need a less vague question.

27:12.829 --> 27:17.163
When you did what you did
to Jeremy's memory of Vicki...

27:17.367 --> 27:19.164
...what else did you do to him?

27:19.369 --> 27:21.963
You asked me to take away

27:23.340 --> 27:25.001
And all the bad stuff.

27:25.175 --> 27:28.633
- Wanted me to take away his suffering.
- But he's acting different.

27:28.812 --> 27:31.804
He seems okay with everything.
And a little too okay.

27:32.015 --> 27:34.950
He's studying, he's not doing drugs,
he's not drinking.

27:35.152 --> 27:36.949
You sure you didn't do
something else?

27:37.154 --> 27:41.147
Elena, I took away his suffering.

27:43.360 --> 27:44.657
- Caroline.
- Don't talk to me.

27:44.828 --> 27:47.729
- Don't do that, let me explain.
- What is there to explain?

27:47.965 --> 27:49.091
You got what you wanted.

27:49.266 --> 27:51.700
Something that doesn't belong to you,
by the way.

27:51.902 --> 27:54.996
And I get called a shallow, useless
waste of space.

27:55.172 --> 27:57.106
- Who said that to you?
- Who do you think?

27:57.274 --> 27:59.765
That's not true.
Don't let him treat you like that.

28:00.010 --> 28:03.377
Yeah, as opposed
to how my best friend treats me.

28:10.721 --> 28:12.086
Help me.

28:13.991 --> 28:16.221
Oh, my God.

28:36.380 --> 28:38.314
Two shots of tequila.

28:43.587 --> 28:44.884
Make that three.

28:46.223 --> 28:48.316
I'm gonna need to see some ID.

28:48.525 --> 28:50.390
No, you don't.

28:54.264 --> 28:56.164
- That will be...
- Free.

28:56.400 --> 28:58.834
- On the house.
- Thanks.

29:06.209 --> 29:08.473
Ah. The famous Elena.

29:09.579 --> 29:11.638
Towel girl.

29:11.815 --> 29:14.579
I've been called worse. Here.

29:15.419 --> 29:17.410
I didn't know
that you guys could drink.

29:17.621 --> 29:19.782
Oh, yeah. It helps curb the cravings.

29:20.457 --> 29:23.255
But makes for a lot of lushy vamps.

29:24.594 --> 29:27.358
You know,
I've never seen Stefan drunk.

29:27.597 --> 29:29.861
- He always seems so...
- Uptight?

29:30.333 --> 29:31.960
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

29:32.436 --> 29:33.494
But not with you.

29:33.670 --> 29:36.662
That's the benefit of knowing someone
for over a hundred years.

29:36.840 --> 29:38.705
You can just be yourself.

29:39.476 --> 29:41.137
Yeah, he can't be himself with me.

29:41.311 --> 29:44.007
Well, not yet.
The first step was him telling you.

29:44.881 --> 29:46.644
The rest comes with time.

29:47.951 --> 29:49.680
You seem so sure.

29:51.888 --> 29:54.584
The love of my life was human.

29:55.692 --> 29:59.287
He went through what I imagine
you're going through.

29:59.463 --> 30:02.023
Denial, anger, et cetera.

30:02.599 --> 30:04.999
But at the end of the day...

30:05.202 --> 30:07.796
...love really did conquer all.

30:12.342 --> 30:13.673
Are you gonna drink that?

30:13.877 --> 30:15.902
Oh, go for it.

30:19.983 --> 30:21.678
I'm scared.

30:23.520 --> 30:27.479
But you're here.
Because you're crazy about him.

30:27.657 --> 30:32.253
I get it, okay?
I mean, what's not to love?

30:32.429 --> 30:36.661
Listen, take it from someone
who has been around a long time.

30:36.833 --> 30:40.530
When it's real, you can't walk away.

30:44.107 --> 30:45.870
Ooh.

30:46.042 --> 30:47.771
Hey, Lexi.

30:49.012 --> 30:51.207
It was really nice meeting you.

31:01.191 --> 31:04.854
Yep, I drank yours. Sorry.

31:06.530 --> 31:08.259
Thank you.

31:08.899 --> 31:10.764
You weren't supposed to be listening.

31:13.904 --> 31:16.805
I was feeling epic. Whatever.

31:29.386 --> 31:32.378
- Keep this contained.
- That's not all.

31:41.464 --> 31:44.126
Hey. Hey.

31:45.235 --> 31:46.964
Did you see what did this?

31:50.907 --> 31:53.205
Tell me everything you saw.

32:06.656 --> 32:07.953
Hi.

32:08.825 --> 32:10.349
Hey.

32:12.128 --> 32:13.220
You came.

32:14.030 --> 32:18.023
I couldn't miss your
hundredth-and-whatever birthday.

32:29.012 --> 32:30.775
Whoa, hey.

32:30.947 --> 32:34.007
I'm sipped... I'm slipped.

32:34.651 --> 32:37.814
- I slipped.
- Hammered, huh?

32:38.355 --> 32:43.122
Well, a very nice
but not handsome bartender...

32:43.293 --> 32:45.659
...was very kind to me tonight.

32:47.030 --> 32:49.965
Unlike the rest of the global universe.

32:52.269 --> 32:55.033
Are those curly fries?

32:55.872 --> 32:58.363
Coffee for the drunk girl.

33:01.177 --> 33:02.576
Bad night, huh?

33:04.080 --> 33:05.138
Baddest.

33:06.182 --> 33:07.206
Am I shallow?

33:09.085 --> 33:12.054
- Is that a trick question?
- I don't mean to be.

33:12.289 --> 33:14.314
Yeah, I wanna be deep.

33:14.891 --> 33:19.021
I wanna be, like, The Abyss deep.

33:20.497 --> 33:23.489
No offense, Car,
but deep's really not your scene.

33:26.036 --> 33:28.300
Well, it's true.

33:28.705 --> 33:29.729
I'm shallow.

33:30.874 --> 33:33.672
I am worse than shallow.

33:33.877 --> 33:35.845
I'm a kiddie pool.

33:36.012 --> 33:38.037
You're not a kiddie pool.

33:38.214 --> 33:41.308
You're not a kiddie pool.

33:41.952 --> 33:43.681
Can I just go home?

33:43.853 --> 33:45.320
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:45.522 --> 33:47.422
I'll take you. Come on.

33:54.364 --> 33:56.195
Hey, you're okay. She's all right.

33:56.366 --> 33:58.231
Hold still, hold still. I got it.

34:08.110 --> 34:10.944
- What happened? Is she okay?
- Like you care.

34:11.481 --> 34:13.574
- She's drunk?
- As a skunk.

34:13.783 --> 34:15.409
Are they serving you in there?

34:16.585 --> 34:19.612
I'll take her home. It's on my way.
I haven't been drinking.

34:20.956 --> 34:23.152
I would appreciate that, Matt.
Thank you.

34:23.393 --> 34:27.226
- You and I will discuss this later.
- Mm. Can't wait.

34:32.502 --> 34:34.936
Don't let anybody else leave.

34:39.409 --> 34:43.505
All right, the shots are a bribe.
I need you to answer a question.

34:43.746 --> 34:45.737
What are you really doing
in Mystic Falls?

34:45.915 --> 34:48.110
Have you tried the brittle?
Wins awards.

34:48.318 --> 34:50.013
Cut the crap.

34:51.788 --> 34:53.585
Okay.

34:54.324 --> 34:56.451
I have a diabolical master plan.

34:58.428 --> 34:59.452
What is it?

34:59.662 --> 35:02.460
If I told you, it wouldn't be
very diabolical, would it?

35:03.533 --> 35:07.799
Okay, look around.
Let me know if you see anyone.

35:41.938 --> 35:44.532
- What are you doing?
- Thank you for the vervain.

35:44.741 --> 35:46.572
Now if you'll excuse me.

35:47.944 --> 35:49.571
Oh, my God.

35:52.315 --> 35:53.475
What is it?

35:55.585 --> 35:57.018
Step aside, please.

35:57.220 --> 35:58.448
Excuse me. Sorry.

36:02.392 --> 36:04.553
Can't go out this way.

36:38.061 --> 36:39.494
Oh, my God.

36:40.897 --> 36:44.697
- Why?
-  It's part of the plan.

36:59.916 --> 37:01.281
You okay?

37:02.719 --> 37:04.277
Thank you.

37:06.322 --> 37:08.654
- Get it in the car, quickly.
- Yeah.

37:15.465 --> 37:19.424
- Lady, I checked everyone's ID.
- Yeah, apparently you didn't.

37:25.241 --> 37:27.106
You're pretty handy with that stake.

37:27.277 --> 37:31.976
Just a reflex.
Guess the adrenalin kicked in.

37:32.148 --> 37:34.742
- This nightmare is finally over.
- Yeah.

37:35.251 --> 37:37.014
Caught a lucky break
with that witness.

37:37.187 --> 37:39.883
Without her, you wouldn't have
been able to ID the vampire.

37:40.056 --> 37:41.956
Very lucky.

37:43.193 --> 37:45.923
Well, thank you again.

37:46.930 --> 37:48.591
You're welcome.

38:12.121 --> 38:14.817
- You gonna be okay?
- No.

38:24.234 --> 38:29.729
Do you ever feel like there's not a person
in the world who loves you?

38:31.741 --> 38:33.470
Life can be a little rough.

38:33.876 --> 38:35.901
I just wish...

38:37.247 --> 38:38.305
What?

38:39.182 --> 38:41.810
Wish that life was...

38:44.020 --> 38:45.817
...different.

38:46.522 --> 38:48.114
Yeah, me too.

38:56.933 --> 38:58.161
Please.

39:00.703 --> 39:02.330
Don't leave me alone.

39:24.193 --> 39:26.593
Stefan. Stefan.

39:26.763 --> 39:28.754
He killed her.

39:28.965 --> 39:32.594
He killed Zach, he killed Tanner,
he turned Vicki.

39:32.769 --> 39:35.237
- I have to kill him.
- No, you can't do that.

39:35.405 --> 39:37.737
Why are you trying to save him?

39:37.907 --> 39:39.397
Elena, he's never gonna change.

39:39.575 --> 39:41.736
Don't you see that?
He's never gonna change.

39:41.911 --> 39:43.742
I'm trying to save you.

39:43.913 --> 39:46.108
You have no idea
what this will do to you.

39:46.282 --> 39:48.682
Everywhere that I go,
pain and death follow.

39:48.885 --> 39:51.251
Damon follows me. No more.

39:51.421 --> 39:55.221
Stefan, please, please, just talk to me.
Let me be here for you.

39:55.391 --> 39:57.291
- Talk to me.
- No.

40:00.563 --> 40:03.259
You were right to stay away from me.

40:20.950 --> 40:23.282
Told you I'd take care of it.

40:41.304 --> 40:44.239
Come on, I did this for you,
to get them off our trail.

40:44.440 --> 40:46.806
You never do anything for anyone
but yourself.

40:54.050 --> 40:56.678
- You missed.
- No.

40:56.853 --> 41:00.016
You saved my life, I'm sparing yours.

41:00.623 --> 41:02.682
We're even.

41:02.859 --> 41:04.121
And now we're done.

41:42.031 --> 41:43.794
It's coming.
