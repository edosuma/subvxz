WEBVTT

00:13.514 --> 00:15.056
I know that one.

00:15.641 --> 00:18.810
I was at the studio
when Grandfather recorded it.

00:24.149 --> 00:25.566
You thinking about your mom?

00:26.694 --> 00:29.445
Mama, everything, my whole life.

00:31.198 --> 00:34.784
It was all a lie. I never knew you.

00:35.160 --> 00:37.412
I never knew you were my dad.

00:38.122 --> 00:40.206
Your life's gonna be okay, Leona.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.710
You're a good kid. You got it together.

00:44.461 --> 00:47.880
You survived the last eight months
on your own.

00:48.716 --> 00:52.176
You're not your grandfather or your
mom.

00:53.053 --> 00:56.264
You're not gonna make
the same mistakes they did.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.808
I'm proud that I'm your father.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.060
I'm proud
that I'm your father.

01:02.688 --> 01:04.605
Glad I'm getting this chance.

01:04.857 --> 01:07.900
I'm glad I'm getting this chance.
This chance...

01:08.944 --> 01:10.862
Ready for a cookie,
darling?

01:12.364 --> 01:15.366
We gotta go! Get out of here!

01:15.492 --> 01:16.492
Leona!

01:31.008 --> 01:32.008
Leona!

03:46.476 --> 03:49.228
You've reached
a number that has been disconnected

03:49.354 --> 03:50.438
and is no longer in service.

03:50.564 --> 03:53.190
If you feel you've reached this
recording in error, go with it.

03:53.317 --> 03:56.235
Hang up. On three. One, two...

03:58.155 --> 03:59.488
House, pick up.

03:59.615 --> 04:03.618
I know it's your day off,
and no doubt got lots of exciting plans,

04:04.161 --> 04:05.411
but I've got a case.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.915
A 16-year-old girl presenting
with cardiogenic shock,

04:11.335 --> 04:12.835
no heart attack.

04:18.926 --> 04:22.595
Dr. Willis, 5-2-2-1.
Dr. Willis, 5-2-2-1.

04:23.722 --> 04:27.266
Her heart looks fine.
ER did a full cardiac workup.

04:27.768 --> 04:30.937
Tox screen's clean,
blood shows no infection.

04:31.063 --> 04:33.481
All on the top page.
I'm a real good reader.

04:34.191 --> 04:36.859
Personal chart handoff means
there's something else.

04:37.569 --> 04:39.195
I'm hoping it's not personal.

04:39.321 --> 04:42.573
The guy who brought the girl in
says he knows you.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.159
I thought I'd met all your friend.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.163
I was also wondering if you could
take a look at these.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.457
When you have a chance. No hurry.

04:51.583 --> 04:53.167
It's just a couple of medical histories.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.379
- One with a minor cancer concern.
- No problem.

04:57.839 --> 04:59.090
G-man!

05:03.929 --> 05:05.763
You thought I was gonna do it,
didn't you?

05:05.889 --> 05:07.598
Do I know you?

05:08.308 --> 05:11.894
- Come on it's me. Crandall.
- Doesn't ring a bell.

05:12.354 --> 05:13.646
Man, I can't believe...

05:13.772 --> 05:17.608
Unless you mean Dylan Crandall,
a man who will believe anything.

05:17.734 --> 05:21.404
- See, I just made you believe that I...
- You haven't changed.

05:22.531 --> 05:23.864
Heard about your leg.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.325
Yeah.
Pulled a hamstring playing Twister.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.827
Just gonna walk it off.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.790
- So who's the girl?
- Jesse Baker's granddaughter.

05:32.916 --> 05:35.251
You always said you'd give
your right hand to play like him.

05:35.377 --> 05:39.088
No. I said I'd give my right hand
to have his left.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.339
Why is she with you?

05:40.465 --> 05:43.467
She lost her mom in Katrina, her home,
everything.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.011
Wow.

05:47.139 --> 05:48.681
And I'm her father.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.351
Hmm.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.897
Yeah, she looks just like you,
got the same 'fro.

05:57.024 --> 06:00.693
I wrote a book about Baker.
Hung out with him, his daughter.

06:01.319 --> 06:03.696
Yeah, that is how babies are made.

06:03.905 --> 06:08.451
I never knew. She never knew.
Her mom lied for 16 years.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.871
- That's unbelievable.
- Yeah.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.373
No, seriously, I don't believe it.

06:14.499 --> 06:16.417
Her mom was pissed at me about my
book.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.419
I trashed her and her dad.
She wouldn't talk to me,

06:18.545 --> 06:20.296
obviously she's not gonna tell Leona
that...

06:20.422 --> 06:23.174
You're a sucker. You always were.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.927
Does that mean
you're not gonna help her?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.846
Why wouldn't I?

06:29.389 --> 06:31.599
She's not scamming me.

06:38.607 --> 06:42.485
- Acute myocardial infarction?
- ER said no. Retest.

06:42.611 --> 06:46.197
- Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome?
- ER said no. Retest.

06:46.323 --> 06:48.657
- And read the damn file.
- You just gave them to us.

06:48.784 --> 06:51.368
- Delta wave on the EKG...
- It's all a no.

06:51.495 --> 06:54.246
- Everything about her heart is healthy.
- She's a Katrina victim.

06:54.372 --> 06:56.999
It's better than Crandall.
He's a Katrina-victim victim.

06:57.125 --> 06:59.376
I don't think she was expecting
your sympathy.

06:59.503 --> 07:02.213
I think her point was New Orleans
was a Third World country:

07:02.339 --> 07:04.090
toxins, mold, sewage in the streets...

07:04.216 --> 07:06.258
What if her heart is like my bike?

07:07.761 --> 07:11.722
Runs like crap when I'm by myself, but I
take it to the mechanic, it runs great.

07:11.848 --> 07:15.101
- An arrhythmia. A one-time event.
- What are we gonna do?

07:15.227 --> 07:18.062
Keep her in her room on a cardiac
monitor till she has another arrhythmia?

07:18.188 --> 07:20.397
- That could be weeks. Months.
- Relax.

07:20.524 --> 07:23.818
I happen to know she's going to have
one right after lunch. We are golden.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.152
You can't induce an arrhythmia

07:25.278 --> 07:27.738
in someone whose heart nearly gave out
48 hours ago.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.907
Sure you can.
It's kind of technical,

07:30.033 --> 07:32.535
but you stick all these
cool little wires inside her somehow...

07:32.661 --> 07:34.829
- I mean you shouldn't.
- Oh, right.

07:34.955 --> 07:37.748
Cos it'd be much more ethical to let it
happen in an uncontrolled setting,

07:37.874 --> 07:39.583
cos there's always a team
of cardiologists

07:39.709 --> 07:42.545
having lunch at the next table.
This is Jersey.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.673
She's a minor, she's gonna need
consent.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.468
- I'll go talk to him.
- Oh, that's an excellent plan.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.012
We'll give him the form
and tell him it's wrong and dangerous.

07:52.139 --> 07:56.142
- I can handle a simple consent form.
- Okay, I'll be Crandall.

07:57.477 --> 07:58.352
Dr. Cameron.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.146
House, from what you say,
this guy will...

08:00.272 --> 08:03.482
Are you in this scene? Go.

08:03.608 --> 08:07.528
I need to talk to you about a procedure
we'd like to do on Leona.

08:07.654 --> 08:10.531
"Like to do?" Is this fun for you?

08:10.657 --> 08:13.784
- He's not you, he's not gonna mock me.
- Stay in character.

08:14.286 --> 08:16.453
I'm so scared, hold me.

08:16.580 --> 08:18.497
In order to figure out which circuit is
misfiring,

08:18.623 --> 08:21.959
we need to map all the electrical
activity in her heart.

08:22.085 --> 08:25.588
Swear to me on the Bible you'd do this
if it was your kid.

08:26.214 --> 08:27.339
Goodbye.

08:30.719 --> 08:35.264
To map the electrical pathways in a
heart, we send electricity through each,

08:35.390 --> 08:37.516
one at a time, till one fails.

08:37.726 --> 08:41.103
- That sounds dangerous.
- It's a risk I'm prepared to take.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.938
If she's got an electrical problem,

08:43.064 --> 08:45.566
couldn't more electricity
blow her whole system?

08:45.692 --> 08:49.195
Well, look who's been watching
Bill Nye, the Science Guy.

08:50.155 --> 08:53.324
The test is perfectly safe.
We do it every day.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.955
- All right.
- And you believe me?

09:00.874 --> 09:04.543
- I shouldn't do the test?
- It's crazy dangerous.

09:08.048 --> 09:10.049
Just sign the damn form.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.472
I'm not crying. I can handle this.

09:16.598 --> 09:19.808
Then blow your nose,
I need DNA from somewhere.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.477
You're not running a paternity test.

09:21.603 --> 09:23.187
She's gonna stay around just long
enough

09:23.313 --> 09:25.272
to get your bank account,
your credit card numbers,

09:25.398 --> 09:26.941
then she'll be off
with her next daddy.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.109
With what she's been through,
why would you assume...

09:29.236 --> 09:30.653
Because of what she's been through.

09:30.779 --> 09:33.155
Because that's your default position,
always has been.

09:33.281 --> 09:34.865
Because she's still alive.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.701
Raised by a junkie,
living on the streets,

09:37.827 --> 09:39.870
that tends to kick
the sweetness out of you.

09:39.996 --> 09:43.707
- I figured you'd have mellowed.
- Because you're an idiot.

09:44.334 --> 09:47.044
If I let you do the test,
it means I don't trust her.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.546
No. It means I don't trust her.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.430
100, 99,

09:59.724 --> 10:01.725
98... She's out.

10:02.143 --> 10:05.354
Heart rhythm's normal.
Insert the first catheter.

10:07.816 --> 10:08.899
I'm in.

10:10.151 --> 10:11.819
All heart rhythms
still normal.

10:11.987 --> 10:13.737
Haven't zapped her yet.

10:17.033 --> 10:19.451
Send the first electrical pulse.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.621
Sinoatrial node is normal.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.084
Next.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.511
Got supraventricular tachycardia.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.263
- Stop the current.
- Is she hallucinating?

10:39.389 --> 10:42.641
- IV push stat, 12.5 adenosine.
- She's crashing. BP's plummeting.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.728
Foreman, is she hallucinating?
No, normal waves.

10:45.854 --> 10:49.565
Then the AV node is not the bad pathway.
All that was was a heart attack.

10:49.691 --> 10:51.567
Reset her,
so we can find the real problem.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.277
Charging. Clear.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.240
Normal rhythm.

10:59.659 --> 11:03.412
Chase, high right atrium, please.

11:03.538 --> 11:06.749
Her heart's fragile after that last
attack. Chances of tachycardia.

11:06.875 --> 11:10.586
You have my permission to blame
Foreman at any negligence trial.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.841
Send the electrical pulse.

11:21.848 --> 11:25.142
- That's the one. She's hallucinating.
- It's near the coronary sinus.

11:25.894 --> 11:27.019
Freeze it.

11:30.482 --> 11:33.359
Damaged heart muscle gone.
Cryoablation complete.

11:33.485 --> 11:35.944
EEG's back to normal. No hallucinations.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.863
She'll be fine by breakfast.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.374
Interesting reading.

11:48.500 --> 11:51.919
Those are my top two choices
for sperm donors.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.755
I wanted your medical opinion
on genetics.

11:56.424 --> 11:57.925
They're losers.

11:59.135 --> 12:00.469
Medically? Or...

12:00.595 --> 12:05.182
Donor 1284 likes square dancing.
No one likes square dancing.

12:05.642 --> 12:08.644
613, he's been practicing medicine
for five minutes,

12:08.770 --> 12:11.397
calls himself a healer, loves Mozart.

12:11.523 --> 12:14.566
I'm not going dancing with them,
I'm looking for healthy sperm.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.485
He's got four living grandparents.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.654
Who they are, what they do,
that doesn't matter?

12:18.780 --> 12:22.825
- I'm leaning toward 613.
- Oh, sure, go with the Jewish number.

12:23.034 --> 12:25.411
1284 has a cousin that tested positive
for the BRCA gene.

12:25.537 --> 12:27.663
But his mother was negative,
which means so is your baby.

12:27.789 --> 12:28.664
What about the...

12:28.790 --> 12:31.333
Mediterranean/Dutch factor
on the dad's side? It's not a problem,

12:31.459 --> 12:34.169
because his dad's mom didn't carry
the thalassemia gene.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.964
Bigger issue is the jerk
and poser genes.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.967
- This Mozart lie.
- People can't like classical music?

12:40.093 --> 12:44.805
You're designing a kid, a loser kid.
He's already getting pummeled at recess.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.516
Here, knock yourself out.

12:47.642 --> 12:50.811
Go find sperm
that can beat up 613's kids.

12:50.937 --> 12:52.646
And thanks for your help.

12:54.315 --> 12:56.358
Pretentiousness is hereditary.

12:56.484 --> 12:58.652
Just 'cause they haven't found
the gene yet...

13:05.702 --> 13:07.828
Could I have some water,
please?

13:09.706 --> 13:10.956
Hello?

13:12.333 --> 13:14.209
I just need some water.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.423
Is anyone there?

13:38.693 --> 13:39.693
Mama?

13:54.042 --> 13:56.376
The second hallucination
means we didn't fix her heart.

13:56.503 --> 13:57.753
Maybe we missed something.

13:57.879 --> 14:01.215
Her heart's fine. If she hallucinated,
it wasn't caused by her heart.

14:01.341 --> 14:05.093
If? The screaming, the floundering,
it was an hallucination.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.430
What if it wasn't a hallucination?

14:08.556 --> 14:09.973
- We covered...
- Not finished.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.018
- What if it was an atypical seizure?
- Seizure?

14:13.144 --> 14:16.730
She saw her mother. Mother's dead.
Ergo, hallucination.

14:20.401 --> 14:23.070
- Anyone wanna explain that?
- His leg hurts.

14:23.196 --> 14:26.114
- Walking takes his mind off of it.
- Flashback!

14:26.241 --> 14:27.866
All that wind and rain
from the hurricane,

14:27.992 --> 14:29.368
post-traumatic stress syndrome.

14:29.494 --> 14:31.828
Why are you so bent on her not having
a hallucination?

14:31.955 --> 14:34.623
If she did have a hallucination,
the heart problem that we predicted,

14:34.749 --> 14:37.960
found, and fixed was just a gigantic
coincidence.

14:40.338 --> 14:42.506
- His leg always hurts.
- It's getting worse.

14:42.632 --> 14:45.551
What if the heart isn't
a coincidence,

14:45.677 --> 14:48.345
and isn't what caused the hallucination?

14:50.223 --> 14:51.932
An arrhythmia hurts.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.561
What if her hallucination
was caused by pain?

14:55.687 --> 14:57.938
What if she has a disease
that translates pain

14:58.064 --> 15:01.024
into a bizarre physiological response
like a hallucination?

15:01.150 --> 15:02.526
She has an autoimmune disease.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.278
She needs a CRP, a rheumatoid factor...

15:04.404 --> 15:07.114
I can prove an autoimmune disease in
five minutes. She needs a PET scan.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.865
You can't test for autoimmune
in a PET...

15:08.992 --> 15:11.827
I'm proving that her hallucinations
are a consistent response to pain,

15:11.953 --> 15:13.829
which proves that she has
an autoimmune disease.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.872
How do you test someone's response
to pain?

15:15.999 --> 15:17.791
Easy. Hurt them.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.755
It's not gonna hurt at all.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.717
We just need to make sure
you don't move.

15:26.843 --> 15:28.510
I won't.

15:29.721 --> 15:33.515
Okay, give me your arm.
I need to check your muscle responses.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.770
Okay, turn it over. Palm upward.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.776
- Everything okay?
- Yeah.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.531
- What the hell was that?
- Diagnostic test.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.743
Cerebral cortex responded normally.
She's not hallucinating.

15:53.244 --> 15:55.412
You know he's not your father,
don't you?

15:55.538 --> 15:57.497
He's my dad, Mama told me.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.207
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.

16:01.586 --> 16:04.880
- House, leave her alone.
- Come on. We both know it's a hustle.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.884
- Are the walls closing in?
- No. Why are you doing this?

16:09.010 --> 16:11.511
- Spiders coming out of my nose?
- Let me out.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.264
House, the test is over.
Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex...

16:14.390 --> 16:15.682
- Give me your hand.
- No!

16:15.808 --> 16:17.392
Give me your hand.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.562
Forget him.

16:20.688 --> 16:24.066
He's not the perfect mark,
because he was the perfect mark.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.693
Plenty of people got there before you.

16:26.819 --> 16:30.739
He's used up, tainted, pumped dry.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.453
She's hallucinating.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.751
She's lost everything
and you're breaking fingers. A new low.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.753
Diagnostically, she needed to be hurt.

16:44.879 --> 16:47.297
I wanted to hurt her. Win-win.

16:47.423 --> 16:50.467
What I didn't consider was a threshold
to trigger the hallucinations.

16:50.593 --> 16:52.594
Otherwise, I'd have done
the finger-bending first,

16:52.720 --> 16:54.513
instead of stabbing her twice.
That was cruel.

16:54.639 --> 16:56.348
If her autoimmune disease is
this advanced,

16:56.474 --> 16:57.808
usual treatment is not gonna help.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.935
We don't even know
which autoimmune disease she has.

17:00.061 --> 17:01.853
Could be Lambert-Eaton,
could be Graves'...

17:01.979 --> 17:03.605
Good point. Let's kill them all at once.

17:03.731 --> 17:06.608
The only way to do that,
is to replace her entire immune system.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.443
Good point. Let's do that.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.821
Bone marrow transplant requires
an exact match.

17:10.947 --> 17:12.447
Leona has no siblings.

17:12.573 --> 17:17.494
Good point. She's all alone, poor thing.
No one in the whole wide world.

17:45.815 --> 17:50.193
I asked for this tuned.
Did you get

17:50.319 --> 17:51.611
If my daughter needs bone marrow,

17:51.738 --> 17:54.948
why are you looking
in a bone marrow registry?

17:55.074 --> 17:57.409
Because that's where they keep
the bone marrow.

17:57.535 --> 17:58.952
I'm her father.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.414
How does somebody who believes
absolutely anything

18:02.540 --> 18:03.832
become a non-fiction writer?

18:03.958 --> 18:05.459
Test my bone marrow.

18:08.755 --> 18:12.674
Here's how this is gonna end: One day,
you'll be sitting at your computer,

18:12.800 --> 18:15.761
writing one of your little music books,
and your daughter will come home

18:15.887 --> 18:19.014
with a big, angry policeman,
who'll throw you in jail because,

18:19.140 --> 18:20.682
"Daddy touched my poozle."

18:20.808 --> 18:22.517
- Test me.
- Happy to.

18:24.854 --> 18:28.315
Just my marrow.
I'm not authorizing a paternity test.

18:28.775 --> 18:31.568
- You're that afraid of the truth?
- I know the truth.

18:31.694 --> 18:34.738
Easy-Lay Fay's truth was that
she needed a bus ticket home

18:34.864 --> 18:36.364
to see her sick grandma.

18:36.991 --> 18:40.494
You gave her 100 bucks. She bought
weed.

18:40.953 --> 18:44.790
I know, because I told her you'd go
for the sick-grandma story.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.833
If our friendship means anything
to you...

18:46.959 --> 18:48.960
Come on. Do you know me at all?

18:49.086 --> 18:50.962
If you do the test,
one of two things happens.

18:51.088 --> 18:54.216
Either you're right or I'm right.
If you're right, I'll be miserable.

18:54.342 --> 18:58.011
And if I'm right, I'll hate myself
'cause I didn't trust her.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.721
Either way I lose.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.939
They don't itch, not raised.

19:11.442 --> 19:14.361
He's had his MMR, no one's sick at
school.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.072
- His father took him camping.
- We caught two spiders.

19:17.198 --> 19:19.866
- You didn't tell me about the spider.
- Did you get a new couch?

19:19.992 --> 19:21.868
Do you think there might be
some sort of toxin...

19:21.994 --> 19:23.203
What color is it?

19:23.329 --> 19:24.538
Red.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.165
Is that where you watch your cartoons
after you take your bath?

19:27.291 --> 19:28.291
Mmm-hmm.

19:34.465 --> 19:35.924
Fall asleep sometimes?

19:36.050 --> 19:37.175
- Yes.
- Bless you.

19:37.301 --> 19:41.054
- Need you. Now.
- Yes, mistress.

19:43.641 --> 19:47.102
I'll write you a prescription
for one of these. Just wet and apply.

19:54.735 --> 19:56.695
You didn't tell anyone else
what I'm doing?

19:56.821 --> 19:58.613
Not a soul.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.617
Wilson?

20:03.911 --> 20:05.787
Cameron, maybe you mentioned it to
her?

20:05.913 --> 20:08.707
No. I'm a really good secret-keeper.

20:09.500 --> 20:12.043
I've never told anybody
that Wilson wets his bed.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.753
Oh, you tricked me.

20:14.630 --> 20:17.299
Part of the protocol
for in vitro fertilization

20:17.425 --> 20:20.552
is twice-daily injections
of menotropins.

20:21.512 --> 20:23.138
I can't do it myself.

20:25.433 --> 20:26.683
Turn around.

20:29.103 --> 20:33.356
- No clever comments about bending over?
- Not unless you want me to.

20:36.027 --> 20:38.737
I'm just not used to
House the professional.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.786
I was just thinking about
what your mother looked like.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.623
'Cause your father obviously chose her
for breeding purposes...

20:49.749 --> 20:53.460
- Shut up.
- Natural selection sucks.

20:54.545 --> 20:57.631
We pick our mates based on breast size,
cars they drive.

20:57.757 --> 21:02.302
They did autopsies on married couples,
found a correlation in pancreas size.

21:03.179 --> 21:05.221
We're hardwired to pick
for stupid reasons.

21:05.348 --> 21:07.098
You have the chance to pick
for smart reasons.

21:07.224 --> 21:11.269
I think the Germans had a similar theory
about 60 years ago.

21:11.395 --> 21:14.564
I'm not advocating wiping out
entire races, I'm just saying

21:14.690 --> 21:18.652
you don't wanna mate with the first
plastic cup that buys you a drink.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.738
I'm pretty sure you got that.

21:22.865 --> 21:24.741
Microbes can be sneaky.

21:30.581 --> 21:31.581
Thanks.

21:33.376 --> 21:36.169
Twice a day. This is gonna be fun.

21:57.692 --> 21:58.775
I got it.

22:07.785 --> 22:09.911
So why were you friends with this guy?

22:11.914 --> 22:15.000
We were 20 years old. He had a car.

22:15.835 --> 22:18.920
If he'd been a woman,
I would have married him.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.298
- Is he a match?
- No.

22:23.384 --> 22:26.678
Lying girl lucked out,
we found one in the registry.

22:27.179 --> 22:28.638
Is he the dad?

22:29.473 --> 22:32.392
- I don't think so.
- You didn't run the test?

22:32.727 --> 22:34.185
Said I wouldn't.

22:35.855 --> 22:37.731
Okay, so either you lied,

22:37.857 --> 22:41.735
or he has pictures of you being nice.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.696
Stop the radiation.

22:51.078 --> 22:52.662
What the hell is that?

22:55.541 --> 22:56.875
I have no idea.

23:05.760 --> 23:08.928
Lab results on the black ooze.
You're not gonna believe it.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.972
She pooped out of her mouth.

23:11.098 --> 23:13.725
The sample contained stool
and digested blood.

23:13.851 --> 23:15.685
- How did you guess?
- 'Cause it oozed.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.645
If it was in her stomach,
it would've sprayed.

23:17.772 --> 23:19.564
If it was in her lungs,
she would have coughed.

23:19.690 --> 23:23.693
This oozed, as in squeezed, as in
reverse peristalsis. Who's hungry?

23:23.819 --> 23:24.861
Mexican takeout?

23:24.987 --> 23:26.988
In order for digested blood
to be in her intestines,

23:27.114 --> 23:28.490
she had to have internal bleeding.

23:28.616 --> 23:31.367
For whatever was in her intestines
to come up, there had to be a blockage.

23:31.494 --> 23:32.368
Liver failure.

23:32.495 --> 23:33.661
No proteins to clot the blood,

23:33.788 --> 23:35.955
so it would leak into her stomach,
mess up her intestines.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.875
Means, oops, we were wrong,
because no autoimmune disease

23:39.001 --> 23:40.585
shuts down an organ in two hours.

23:40.711 --> 23:43.880
We need to do a liver biopsy,
find out what the real problem is.

23:50.429 --> 23:51.429
Hey.

23:52.181 --> 23:53.890
Need to talk to you.

24:07.655 --> 24:11.282
The good news is, she doesn't have
an autoimmune condition,

24:11.408 --> 24:13.159
so she doesn't need
a bone marrow transplant,

24:13.285 --> 24:16.121
and we were able to stop
the irradiation in time.

24:16.247 --> 24:19.124
The bad news, she has potty mouth.

24:19.834 --> 24:24.003
Her liver is failing which has made
her digestive system go in reverse.

24:25.714 --> 24:27.841
It's actually much worse than it sounds.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.887
We need to do a liver biopsy.

24:34.181 --> 24:37.809
I don't know what's gonna happen
when we stick a needle into her liver.

24:38.435 --> 24:40.311
She could die right then and there.

24:41.772 --> 24:43.898
Ease it. Tell me what to do.

24:45.025 --> 24:47.443
No inside information on this one.

24:50.114 --> 24:53.992
Look, Crandall, three days ago,
you didn't even know this girl.

24:55.828 --> 24:59.789
If she'd been hit by a bus,
you wouldn't lose a moment's sleep.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.710
There are people all over this hospital
in just as much trouble,

25:03.836 --> 25:05.461
just as not related to you.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.505
You telling me I shouldn't care?

25:09.049 --> 25:11.217
Prepping me to handle it
for when she dies?

25:37.411 --> 25:42.624
It's brown, it's lumpy,
I'm going to heave all over my desk.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.959
Chicken mole.

25:45.294 --> 25:47.754
Twenty-one herbs and spices.

25:49.965 --> 25:55.011
I find it very comforting, you defending
a man you haven't seen in years.

25:55.179 --> 25:58.890
To know my friend, no matter what, will
always be my champion, my protector.

25:59.016 --> 26:01.517
I'm not protecting him,
I'm smacking her.

26:01.644 --> 26:03.019
The modesty of the true hero.

26:03.145 --> 26:06.940
Push me and I'll let her die,
just so you'll stop annoying me.

26:08.025 --> 26:10.318
Here's my theory. You're jealous.
He's maturing,

26:10.444 --> 26:14.656
he's accepting responsibility,
you're emotionally stuck at 17.

26:14.782 --> 26:18.034
He's manufacturing responsibility,
he's not maturing.

26:18.369 --> 26:20.161
He hasn't changed at all.

26:21.497 --> 26:25.208
- So, then why do you care?
- That black ooze we saw?

26:25.793 --> 26:27.835
That was a bowel movement

26:29.171 --> 26:30.588
out of her mouth.

26:31.257 --> 26:34.425
You're trying to end this conversation
by grossing me out?

26:34.551 --> 26:35.927
I'm an oncologist.

26:36.053 --> 26:39.138
Half my patients have their skin
sloughing off.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.976
Why are you so worried about this guy?

26:43.435 --> 26:46.521
He was having a rough time
with his girlfriend.

26:47.231 --> 26:50.191
He was in love, he's always in love,

26:51.026 --> 26:52.902
he wanted to marry her.

26:53.028 --> 26:56.531
And I thought she was flaky,
was sending mixed signals.

26:57.366 --> 27:00.159
So you gave him advice,
and she dumped him.

27:01.078 --> 27:04.831
No. I told him that I would talk to her.

27:07.001 --> 27:10.128
- And you blew it?
- Technically...

27:14.383 --> 27:17.302
I was doing him a favor. She was nuts.

28:15.861 --> 28:17.737
Stop the biopsy.

28:19.823 --> 28:22.658
- I'm right at her liver.
- It's House. He says stop.

28:30.209 --> 28:31.584
Check it out.

28:32.628 --> 28:35.922
Look, please tell me you didn't stop
the biopsy to play us some tunes.

28:36.048 --> 28:40.093
The left hand is very subtle,
very delicate.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.135
This girl is dying.

28:41.261 --> 28:45.181
Be dying a lot faster if I let you do
that obviously unnecessary biopsy.

28:45.307 --> 28:46.724
Now, listen.

28:46.850 --> 28:49.936
I asked for this tuned.
Did you get

28:50.062 --> 28:53.356
My God. Grandpa was an angry drunk.
If only we'd known!

28:53.482 --> 28:56.859
Here's how to become a great artist.
First, get miserable.

28:56.985 --> 28:59.070
Misery drives you to become
a great artist,

28:59.196 --> 29:01.239
but the art does nothing
for your misery,

29:01.365 --> 29:04.033
which drives you to drugs,
which makes you a lousy artist.

29:04.159 --> 29:05.910
And this is not lousy.

29:06.537 --> 29:10.832
- You saying he didn't do drugs?
- Not when he played this.

29:10.958 --> 29:13.459
Something was screwing
with his personality.

29:13.585 --> 29:16.254
Yeah. Drugs and alcohol don't do that.

29:16.380 --> 29:19.173
And that note that he says
is out of tune, it's not.

29:19.299 --> 29:22.718
Which means that something is screwing
with his aural perception, too.

29:22.845 --> 29:25.471
Now, what happens when you add
all of that to the liver disease,

29:25.597 --> 29:26.764
which he supposedly died of?

29:26.890 --> 29:28.933
Too much iron.
He could have had hemochromatosis.

29:29.059 --> 29:30.017
That's genetic.

29:30.144 --> 29:32.395
Unless you can tell me Miles Davis
couldn't play stoned...

29:32.521 --> 29:34.105
Played better when he wasn't.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.649
I think. I mean, no one knows for sure.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.693
I'll get Leona a TIBC
and serum ferritin.

29:38.819 --> 29:40.611
We can test this in three minutes.

29:51.415 --> 29:53.332
So, what is she, Foreman,

29:53.834 --> 29:56.836
a light-skinned black chick
or a dark-skinned white chick?

29:56.962 --> 29:59.380
I'm not sure.
Can we hear the music again?

29:59.506 --> 30:01.382
It's too early to see jaundice
from her liver.

30:01.508 --> 30:05.219
True. But this is a photograph of Leona
when she was 13 years old.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.804
She's darker now.

30:07.055 --> 30:10.308
She's been living on the streets
for eight months.

30:11.185 --> 30:12.727
No tan line.

30:13.312 --> 30:16.230
So, unless those streets she's been
living on are indoor streets,

30:16.356 --> 30:18.858
I'm thinking she's got iron deposits
in melanin.

30:18.984 --> 30:23.196
Both byproducts of hemochromatosis,
just like Granddad used to make.

30:23.989 --> 30:27.492
SQUID exam to calculate
the amount of iron in her blood,

30:27.618 --> 30:30.953
and treat her with deferoxamine.
She'll be fine by lunch.

30:31.079 --> 30:34.874
'Cause, you see, I was wrong before
about the breakfast.

30:54.394 --> 30:57.313
There's the iron. Lots of it.

31:04.571 --> 31:06.280
I'm not gonna get this job, am I?

31:06.406 --> 31:09.450
It's a done deal.
I knew it the moment I saw you.

31:09.576 --> 31:11.619
Interview's just a formality.

31:11.995 --> 31:15.706
- House, what are you...
- Lisa Cuddy, this is Patrick Linehan.

31:15.832 --> 31:18.751
Patrick's gonna be the new intern
rotating in my department.

31:18.877 --> 31:21.170
I didn't even know you were looking
for one. Nice to meet you.

31:23.423 --> 31:25.925
Sorry. I laugh when I'm nervous.

31:27.261 --> 31:30.137
Bet you've been doing that
your whole life, huh?

31:30.847 --> 31:33.474
What kind of medicine
are you interested in, Patrick?

31:33.600 --> 31:36.894
Cancer, infectious disease.
The big devils.

31:37.938 --> 31:41.440
I think that medicine has become
too institutionalized.

31:41.733 --> 31:45.444
We need to send a message to our
patients that we're just like them.

31:45.571 --> 31:47.613
I mean, we're all people.

31:49.324 --> 31:52.159
"We're all people." I like that.

31:54.997 --> 31:57.623
See, she's all hard science, facts.

31:57.749 --> 32:00.501
I like to know a person's
hopes and dreams.

32:00.627 --> 32:02.670
- What kind of music do you like?
- Actually, I don't...

32:02.796 --> 32:03.796
I'm a Mozart man.

32:04.214 --> 32:06.882
He says what I feel but can't express.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.679
I'm late for a meeting.

32:11.805 --> 32:15.057
You see, this is why the face-to-face
interview is so important.

32:15.183 --> 32:18.185
You gotta know
who you're getting in bed with.

32:24.651 --> 32:26.110
Get him out of here.

32:34.286 --> 32:36.829
Deferoxamine is a chelating agent.

32:37.831 --> 32:41.292
It binds to the iron,
so that her liver can get rid of it.

32:41.418 --> 32:42.877
Once the iron's out of the liver,

32:43.003 --> 32:46.505
it's finally evacuated by the body
in the form of urine.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.549
Should be quick and painless.

33:09.696 --> 33:12.990
- Leona? What's happening?
- Crash cart. She's not getting any air.

33:34.429 --> 33:36.889
CT showed her lungs
are Swiss cheese.

33:37.015 --> 33:40.976
Ventilator's helping, but at this rate,
her time's basically up.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.814
We developed a theory,
hemochromatosis.

33:44.940 --> 33:48.275
Like good scientists, we tested that
theory. We proved that theory.

33:48.402 --> 33:51.195
We acted based on that proof
and we treated her.

33:51.321 --> 33:54.407
As a result of which,
she is on the verge of death.

33:54.533 --> 33:57.868
Is it just me, or have we discovered
a flaw in the scientific method?

33:57.994 --> 33:59.662
Walk me through it step by step.

33:59.788 --> 34:02.373
What is supposed to happen
when you give someone deferoxamine?

34:02.499 --> 34:04.792
- It's a chelating agent.
- And what does the chelating do?

34:04.918 --> 34:06.752
- It removes excess iron from the liver.
- How?

34:06.878 --> 34:10.673
The iron is heavy, it gets stuck.
Deferoxamine is like a lubricant.

34:10.799 --> 34:13.175
It makes the iron slick,
so it can move around again.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.427
Moves around where?

34:14.553 --> 34:17.513
It's supposed to be discharged
through waste.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.808
Her waste system is a little screwy
right now.

34:20.934 --> 34:23.853
Means the iron can't go
where it wants to go.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.855
What if it moved to her lungs?

34:25.981 --> 34:29.859
Then whatever's in her lungs likes iron,
bound with it, started poking holes.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.110
What likes iron?

34:31.236 --> 34:34.613
Oxygen attaches itself to iron,
which increases her chance of infection.

34:34.740 --> 34:37.199
No, we started massive antibiotics prior
to the radiation.

34:37.325 --> 34:39.744
Some neurodegenerative diseases
like iron.

34:39.870 --> 34:41.787
MRI was clean.
No iron deposits on the brain.

34:41.913 --> 34:42.872
Fungus likes iron.

34:45.167 --> 34:47.042
No objections to that one?

34:47.210 --> 34:49.253
If a fungus is doing all this,
she's dead.

34:49.379 --> 34:51.714
There are 25 antifungals,
if we don't know which fungus...

34:51.840 --> 34:52.923
When in doubt, go broad.

34:53.049 --> 34:56.302
- Most common is aspergillus.
- Continue to ventilate her lungs.

34:56.428 --> 35:00.598
Get her on a voriconazole drip
and hope she has aspergillus.

35:08.482 --> 35:11.692
The process is confidential.
You violated his privacy.

35:11.818 --> 35:12.818
But how did you even...

35:12.944 --> 35:15.362
I looked up "loser" in the cryobank.

35:15.572 --> 35:18.115
You wouldn't go within 100 miles
of that idiot.

35:18.241 --> 35:19.825
Yet you're willing to have his baby.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.911
I'm not looking for a date,
I'm tired of looking.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.167
Cotton ball?

35:29.669 --> 35:32.838
I don't care if you marry this guy,
date this guy, go through his garbage,

35:32.964 --> 35:34.757
but you should know.

35:34.883 --> 35:37.551
Genes matter. Who you are matters.

35:38.011 --> 35:39.762
Find someone you trust.

35:41.598 --> 35:43.140
Someone like you?

35:45.060 --> 35:46.060
Someone you like.

35:54.611 --> 35:56.362
Listen... Oh, sorry. Okay.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.949
- It's not what you think.
- I rub his leg.

36:00.075 --> 36:01.242
Oh, Ingrid.

36:01.618 --> 36:02.743
Hi.

36:02.994 --> 36:07.373
Okay, you feel guilty about stealing
the guy's girl, I get that.

36:07.541 --> 36:09.542
And I'm glad, it's a good thing.

36:09.668 --> 36:11.877
But you did the paternity test.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.547
And either the paternity test
comes back negative

36:14.673 --> 36:16.173
and you shove it in the guy's face,

36:16.299 --> 36:21.512
or it comes back positive, and you
shut up, and your leg starts hurting.

36:21.638 --> 36:23.305
Or I never ran the test.

36:24.140 --> 36:26.976
- Not what you think.
- Leona's lungs collapsed.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.895
The treatment's not working.
We've got the wrong fungus.

36:31.106 --> 36:33.148
You can stop. She ruined it.

36:34.526 --> 36:39.113
Three rules for hunting fungus:
location, location, location.

36:39.239 --> 36:42.616
Crandall says she was living
at the children's shelter in Ridgeland.

36:42.742 --> 36:44.618
Okay. The one thing we know for sure

36:44.744 --> 36:47.121
is she was not living
in the children's shelter in Ridgeland.

36:47.247 --> 36:49.623
- Why would he lie about that?
- He wouldn't.

36:49.749 --> 36:52.084
But he'd believe her story about the
sweet little girl

36:52.210 --> 36:53.460
trying to do the right thing.

36:53.587 --> 36:56.297
We can't ask Leona where she was.
She's intubated.

37:14.149 --> 37:15.316
Don't try to talk.

37:15.442 --> 37:18.027
You got a big medical thing
in your mouth.

37:18.153 --> 37:20.237
Just blink if you understand me.

37:23.283 --> 37:25.075
Fantastic.

37:25.493 --> 37:29.204
Blink if you lied to Crandall
about everything.

37:33.293 --> 37:35.794
You picked up a fungus somewhere.

37:36.630 --> 37:40.090
If you were living at this shelter,
like you told your new daddy,

37:40.216 --> 37:43.093
then I got nothing to go on
and you will die.

37:44.971 --> 37:48.557
So, did you lie to Crandall?

37:53.146 --> 37:55.189
You're a lousy con artist.

37:56.608 --> 37:59.151
First rule of the game
is know your mark.

37:59.277 --> 38:03.113
Once you got Crandall to bite
on the papa thing, you had him.

38:03.239 --> 38:05.074
You could have told him
that you were servicing

38:05.200 --> 38:06.992
Al-Qaeda suicide bombers for crack,

38:07.118 --> 38:11.830
and this guy would still have let you
pick out the colors in your new room.

38:12.248 --> 38:14.875
Did you lie to Crandall?

38:32.394 --> 38:34.019
Where were you?

38:42.487 --> 38:44.780
And the winner is...

38:45.240 --> 38:48.492
Oh, you read it,
I just get so nervous at these things.

38:49.285 --> 38:51.912
- Recording studio?
- She read the book.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.541
She knew how much Crandall hated
that place, what went on there.

38:55.667 --> 38:58.210
- She overplayed her hand.
- She was desperate.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.212
If she didn't sell this,
she was stuck in hell.

39:00.338 --> 39:02.172
Recording studio doesn't help us
medically.

39:02.298 --> 39:03.882
Recording studios.

39:04.009 --> 39:07.052
Why are these buildings different
from all other buildings?

39:07.178 --> 39:10.097
Sound-proofing.
Absorbs sound, also absorbs moisture.

39:10.223 --> 39:13.308
Where there's moisture, a lot of it,
say Katrina-moist...

39:13.435 --> 39:16.979
Zygomycosis. Only occurs
at the highest levels of mold.

39:17.105 --> 39:21.066
Start her on an IV drip of amphotericin
B with colony stimulating factors.

39:21.192 --> 39:22.735
She'll be fine by

39:23.278 --> 39:24.611
dinner.

39:31.494 --> 39:35.205
- She's gonna be fine.
- She said she'd never go back there.

39:38.334 --> 39:42.588
She lied to you. She's your kid.
Get used to it.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.629
Thank you for the injections.

40:25.173 --> 40:26.423
You're welcome.

40:29.761 --> 40:33.013
You came all the way up here
just to tell me that?

40:34.140 --> 40:35.182
No.

40:47.821 --> 40:51.406
Pretty much normal.
Liver function tests are good.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.493
Thanks, G-man.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.997
What makes you think
you'd be a good father?

40:59.666 --> 41:01.250
I don't know.

41:02.377 --> 41:03.877
It feels right.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.213
It feels good.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.423
Well, at least you got a good reason.

41:08.550 --> 41:10.926
Feels good is a good enough reason.

41:15.682 --> 41:18.267
- What's happening?
- She's choking. She can't breathe.

41:18.393 --> 41:20.310
- Get him out of here, will you?
- Come on...

41:20.436 --> 41:21.311
Out!

41:22.605 --> 41:24.148
Quick, the curtain!

41:31.573 --> 41:34.908
You're breathing on your own.
The choking's normal.

41:39.664 --> 41:43.667
I lied to him. I ran a paternity test.

41:46.963 --> 41:51.175
Your lie was a bad one.

41:56.097 --> 41:57.472
He is your dad.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.316
We're even.

42:22.040 --> 42:25.292
Your machine's
broken, there's not even a message.

42:25.460 --> 42:29.004
House? Are you there? Okay.

42:31.174 --> 42:33.133
See you Monday, I guess.
