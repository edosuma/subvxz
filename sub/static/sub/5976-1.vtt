Mission Control, do you read?

Mayday. Mayday.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.575
On reentry into Earth's orbit,
I seem to have fallen into,

00:34.660 --> 00:38.246
I don't know,
some kind of tear
in time and space.

00:38.330 --> 00:42.125
My coordinates are unknown.
Is this even Earth?

00:43.252 --> 00:47.505
Ship's instruments
indicate should be
White Sands, New Mexico.

00:47.589 --> 00:51.300
Obvious error.
Is anyone receiving this?
Come back.

00:52.219 --> 00:54.220

Oh, God. Oh, God.

00:56.974 --> 01:01.060
Recovery team!
Recovery team,
fix coordinates now!

01:02.354 --> 01:05.773
Where the hell am I?
Somebody respond!

01:05.858 --> 01:07.567
Recovery team,
come back, God damn it!

01:07.651 --> 01:08.776

01:10.529 --> 01:12.280
Oh, God. Oh, God!

01:12.740 --> 01:14.240

No!

MALE ANNOUNCER:
This is Today,
with Matt Lauer.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.801
We're back now with
Dr. Rick Marshall,

01:33.886 --> 01:36.387
whose new book arrives
in stores tomorrow.

01:36.722 --> 01:42.268
It was back in Oslo, Doctor,
last month, that you just
startled your colleagues

01:42.352 --> 01:45.897
with this theory of yours
that takes science in
a completely new direction.

01:45.981 --> 01:47.023
Quantum. . .
Quantum Paleontology.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.274
Quantum Paleontology,
that's correct.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.942
What exactly is that?

01:50.027 --> 01:54.280
Well, it's. . .
Not to say modestly,
it's our very future, Matt.

01:54.364 --> 01:56.491
It's the only
real solution

01:56.575 --> 01:58.951
to solving this
fossil fuel crisis
we're experiencing.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.579
And it boils down
to two simple words.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.080
Renewable biofuels.

02:03.165 --> 02:05.208
Close. Time warps.

02:06.627 --> 02:07.627
Time warps?
Time warps.

02:07.711 --> 02:08.669
You're serious about this.

02:08.753 --> 02:10.630
I'm deadly serious.

02:10.714 --> 02:14.091
Five years,
over $50 million
on my research.

02:14.176 --> 02:17.637
You've spent
$50 million of your own
money studying time warps?

02:17.721 --> 02:21.307
No, that's adorable.
No, taxpayers' money.
I don't have $50 million.

02:21.391 --> 02:22.725
And now you're
asking for more.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.268
It's all explained
in my book.

02:24.353 --> 02:25.478
I know.
We've plugged
the book.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.854
(READING)

02:26.939 --> 02:27.939
Yeah.

02:28.023 --> 02:29.106
Bantam Books. Amazon.

02:29.191 --> 02:32.819
We are living
in a time right now
with huge cuts in. . .

02:32.903 --> 02:33.945
I saw.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.404
Huge cuts in spending.
Right.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.989
We're in dire
economic straits,

02:37.074 --> 02:40.952
and you're
spending $50 million
on studying time warps.

02:41.036 --> 02:42.995
How do you not think
that's irresponsible?

02:43.080 --> 02:44.163
Well, I. . .
Are you smoking?

02:44.248 --> 02:45.998
No, I'm making a balloon
animal here, earthling.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.291
But you can't smoke
in the studio.

02:47.376 --> 02:48.543
Okay, no one told me that.

02:49.211 --> 02:50.169
Just, you can't.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.587
Look, look. . . Fine.

02:51.672 --> 02:56.342
There are huge, huge
amounts of trans-dimensional
energy out there

02:56.426 --> 02:58.177
just waiting for us
to throw the switch.

02:58.262 --> 02:59.512
Energy crisis averted.

02:59.596 --> 03:04.141
You are asking people
to stake the entire future
of industrialized civilization

03:04.226 --> 03:06.853
on what you call
"parallel dimensions."

03:07.396 --> 03:09.856
What about the critics
who have a fair question,
Doctor?

03:09.940 --> 03:10.940
Mmm-hmm.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.235
They say this theory
of yours is not science.
It is non-science.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.904
And some are even more blunt,
and they say it's nonsense.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.114
How do you
respond to that?

03:18.198 --> 03:19.407
My critics?
Your critics.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.200
And there are
a lot of them.
Can you be more specific?

03:21.285 --> 03:22.785
Stephen Hawking.

03:22.870 --> 03:26.831
Stephen Hawking
says this is nonsense.
That's his word.

03:26.915 --> 03:28.416
Okay, you know what?
This interview's over.

03:28.500 --> 03:29.625
Why?

03:29.710 --> 03:32.295
Because, like, your
producers said you wouldn't
bring that up, all right?

03:32.379 --> 03:33.379
It's a fair question.

03:33.463 --> 03:35.131
No, it's not!
It's a hatchet job!

03:35.549 --> 03:37.383
That was my guest
Dr. Rick Marshall,

03:37.467 --> 03:38.426
whose book arrives
in stores tomorrow.

03:38.510 --> 03:39.677
RlCK: Goddamn
right it was!

03:39.761 --> 03:40.761
You might want to look for it

03:40.846 --> 03:44.265
in the "I'm out of my
freaking mind" department.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.142

(RlCK SCREAMING)

03:59.156 --> 04:03.159
Ladies and gentlemen,
esteemed colleagues,
I'll conclude with this.

04:03.660 --> 04:06.621
Our very future
depends on one thing.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.039
(RlCK READING)

04:08.498 --> 04:11.083
Subatomic particles that
move so incredibly fast,

04:11.168 --> 04:13.419
they actually travel
backwards in time.

04:13.503 --> 04:18.298
Ask yourself, what if there
was a device that could
harness these tachyons?

04:18.382 --> 04:22.678
We could open
and travel through
warps in time and space.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.932
What's that?
Not in our lifetime?

04:26.850 --> 04:29.977
My friends,
I've designed
such a device.

04:30.062 --> 04:32.688
I give to you
the tachyon amplifier.

04:33.482 --> 04:35.483
Genius in a box.

04:35.567 --> 04:39.570
Only with this device,
you don't travel
forwards or backwards.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.822
You travel sideways in time

04:42.032 --> 04:46.452
to another dimension
where past, present
and future all meet.

04:47.454 --> 04:48.871
And lights!

04:50.415 --> 04:52.541
All right,
any questions?

04:53.126 --> 04:55.795
Oh ! Great. Yes.
You, right there, young man.

04:55.879 --> 04:58.798
Yeah.
If you shot a ton
of pot at the sun,

04:58.882 --> 05:00.967
would it burn up
and get everybody high?

05:01.051 --> 05:02.593
No. No, no.

05:02.678 --> 05:05.513
Are there any real questions
that pertain to science?

05:05.597 --> 05:06.973

05:07.057 --> 05:09.809

in the bathroom
before this presentation?

05:09.893 --> 05:11.894
How come it looks like
you're about to cry now?

05:11.979 --> 05:13.354
Do dinosaurs have boobs?

05:13.438 --> 05:15.189
That's it. That's it.
Everybody out of here.

05:15.273 --> 05:17.858
Get out of here!
Go play in the parking lot.

05:17.943 --> 05:19.151
Go run around
on the freeway,

MAN: Okay, guys,
let's get some sugar!

05:20.821 --> 05:22.488
I have a question.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.241
Did you ever try to make
the tachyon amplifier?

05:25.325 --> 05:26.325
Who are you?

05:26.410 --> 05:27.910
Oh ! I'm sorry.
I'm Holly Cantrell.

05:28.036 --> 05:30.663

work at Cambridge.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.082
I think you're brilliant.

05:34.418 --> 05:37.211
Well, Holly from Cambridge
who thinks I'm brilliant,

05:37.295 --> 05:39.380
I started,
but I didn't finish.
So, no.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.924
No, but you have to build it.
I mean,
it's the most incredible. . .

05:42.467 --> 05:44.301
What are you eating?

05:44.386 --> 05:46.971
It's a donut
stuffed with M&M's.

05:47.389 --> 05:50.599
That way when you finish
the donut, you don't
have to eat any M&M's.

05:50.684 --> 05:53.436
But don't you see?
You were absolutely right.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.562
Everything. . .
Stop!

05:55.188 --> 05:59.817
Chasing that theory got me
laughed out of mainstream
science and landed me here.

05:59.901 --> 06:02.319
And you know what?
I don't have anyone
to blame but myself.

06:02.863 --> 06:08.492
'Cause, as they say,
if you don't make it,
it's your own damn "vault."

06:08.577 --> 06:10.828
That's a bitch-slap
of truth right there.

06:10.912 --> 06:15.082
If your theories
are such rubbish,
then explain this.

06:18.211 --> 06:22.131

of a $1 0 lighter.

along with crystals like this

and lapsed into a food coma.

I've had issues
with food in the past,
and I don't know, you know,

07:53.598 --> 07:56.225
just with the stress
of everything,
I just overdid it.

07:57.269 --> 08:00.980
But I'm in control,
and I don't have to
go back to Phoenix.

08:02.065 --> 08:05.484
I just. . . I wanted to come
and apologize for yesterday.

No. No. I mean, yes.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.788
I don't know.
I finished
building it, yes,

08:17.873 --> 08:21.333
but I didn't have
the nerve to test it out.

08:22.711 --> 08:27.006
So I thought a trip
to Arby's might give me
some courage, but no dice.

08:27.090 --> 08:29.466
Then I had
Popeye's, Del Taco.

calories later,

a 1 2-inch veggie
on whole wheat,

08:37.601 --> 08:39.852
babbling
to a cutout
of Jared.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.395
It still didn't
give me the strength
to turn that thing on.

08:43.899 --> 08:44.857
I'm a coward.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.484
You are not a coward.
You're a visionary.

in the last 1 00 years.

38:15.877 --> 38:16.961
No, Rick Marshall.

38:17.045 --> 38:20.923
I have summoned you here
specifically to help me
stop an evil madman

38:21.007 --> 38:26.220
who has already conquered
my world and now plans
to conquer yours.

38:26.304 --> 38:30.265

with using the power
of these crystals

to conquer the universe.

38:40.318 --> 38:44.029
If he is not stopped,
he will open
a doorway to your world

38:44.114 --> 38:49.159
and lead his army
of Sleestak on a rampage
across time and space.

38:50.161 --> 38:51.912
He must be stopped.

You're a scientist.

you and I can figure
this out. Now. . .

You mustn't
touch the crystals!

Okay!

What do you need from us?

39:11.099 --> 39:15.102
The Zarn lacks only one thing
to enact his evil plan.

A device to amplify tachyons
and unleash the full
power of the crystals.

39:20.191 --> 39:23.569
Well, Marshall's created
a device that isolates
tachyon interference.

39:23.653 --> 39:24.903
Yeah, I did that.

39:24.988 --> 39:26.238
Of course.

focused along the proper

pinpoint its location.

is here in the pylon.

these crystals
are the doorway.

01:26:58.463 --> 01:27:01.132
The door.
It's closing forever!

01:27:15.606 --> 01:27:17.899
It's barely holding.
Let's go!

01:27:21.570 --> 01:27:22.570
(SCOFFS)

01:27:22.654 --> 01:27:26.157
It's your home
or your comrade,
Dr. Marshall.

01:27:26.241 --> 01:27:27.241
(LAUGHS)

01:27:27.326 --> 01:27:29.827
No, it isn't. Reverse!

01:27:31.121 --> 01:27:34.498
You go!
I've got this yellow
bastard in lockdown.

01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:35.750
I'm gonna stay.

01:27:35.834 --> 01:27:36.876
What?
What?

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:39.253
Yeah. I've been
talking to my man Chaka.

01:27:39.338 --> 01:27:41.631
He pitches
a pretty good world.

01:27:41.715 --> 01:27:44.759
I mean, think about it.
My home was never
in the real world.

01:27:44.843 --> 01:27:47.595
I never belonged.
This could be
a fresh start for me.

01:27:47.679 --> 01:27:49.055
You know, make
some new friends.

01:27:49.139 --> 01:27:51.599
I could be somebody,
a winner.

01:27:51.808 --> 01:27:52.850
Ow!

01:27:53.352 --> 01:27:55.269
Wow, I really admire
you right now.

01:27:55.354 --> 01:27:57.313
I just feel
like so many people
go through this life

01:27:57.397 --> 01:27:59.315
looking for what
I've found here,
you know?

01:27:59.399 --> 01:28:02.276
And they themselves,
they never find it.

01:28:02.361 --> 01:28:06.030
Or worse, they find it,
but they let it slip away.

01:28:07.574 --> 01:28:09.283
I am so afraid
of that happening.

01:28:09.368 --> 01:28:11.953
You wouldn't be human
if you didn't feel scared.

01:28:12.037 --> 01:28:14.121
Marshall ! Please.

01:28:14.206 --> 01:28:16.874
You can't leave me here
like this with him !

01:28:16.959 --> 01:28:20.211
As one scientist to another,
I beg you for mercy.

01:28:22.255 --> 01:28:25.508
Science shows no mercy,
and neither do I.

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:28.302
That's good.
Thank you.

01:28:28.762 --> 01:28:30.471
Let's go, Holly.

01:28:33.684 --> 01:28:34.767
Ready?

01:28:34.851 --> 01:28:35.893
Ready.

01:28:37.062 --> 01:28:39.981
Chaka? Technically,
I'm still your master!

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:53.703
HOLLY: Marshall?

01:28:53.996 --> 01:28:55.204
Holly?

01:29:06.675 --> 01:29:08.676
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:29:10.971 --> 01:29:16.434
I just want to say
you have grown into
a beautiful woman.

01:29:21.398 --> 01:29:22.773
Oh, no. . .

01:29:31.283 --> 01:29:32.533

01:29:34.411 --> 01:29:35.995
Where's Will?

01:29:36.747 --> 01:29:39.081
He went to a better place.

01:29:41.043 --> 01:29:42.668
You killed him?

01:29:42.753 --> 01:29:43.753
No.

01:29:45.297 --> 01:29:48.466
No, he went
to a strange world,

01:29:49.801 --> 01:29:54.597
a world of dinosaurs,
monkey people, lizard people,

01:29:55.724 --> 01:30:00.394
a hole in space and time,
a virtual land of the lost.

01:30:02.022 --> 01:30:05.941
And as hard
as it is to believe,
Will chose to stay.

01:30:07.360 --> 01:30:09.153
All right. Cool.

01:30:10.781 --> 01:30:14.575
WlLL: Yeah,
did you see those Sleestaks
kick the crap out of Enik?

01:30:15.077 --> 01:30:17.078
I've never seen
them move so fast.

I couldn't agree more,
little buddy. Tunic.

01:30:22.834 --> 01:30:25.503
Hop up.
I got you, come on.

How's it going?
I'm Will. Pretty much
Chaka's best friend.

01:31:22.227 --> 01:31:25.104
I'm here to offer
y'all protection

01:31:25.188 --> 01:31:28.357
and shelter and really
pretty much anything

01:31:28.441 --> 01:31:31.402
that you guys would
ever need, okay.

Hey, yeah.

Well, look at that, huh?

Hey, you're back there, too.
Okay. This was definitely
a good choice.

ANNOUNCER: This is Today,
with Matt Lauer.

01:31:49.671 --> 01:31:52.882
It's been some time
since my final
guest was here,

01:31:52.966 --> 01:31:57.678
but after the remarkable
events of the past year,

01:31:57.762 --> 01:31:59.305
he needs no introduction.

01:31:59.389 --> 01:32:02.892
He's back with a new book
and more startling evidence

01:32:03.476 --> 01:32:05.019
of, you guessed it,
time warps.

01:32:05.103 --> 01:32:06.979
The pipe's allowed.
I asked.

01:32:07.063 --> 01:32:08.856
That's great news.

01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:11.192
You've had quite a year.

01:32:11.276 --> 01:32:13.360
Actually,
a stellar year, Matt.

01:32:13.445 --> 01:32:15.529
In fact, I brought
you back a dinosaur egg,

01:32:15.614 --> 01:32:18.532
which my beautiful
partner and lover,

01:32:18.617 --> 01:32:21.452
Holly Cantrell,
was gracious
enough to transport.

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:22.703
And I'm obviously
very excited

01:32:22.787 --> 01:32:24.705
about my new tome.
It's a book.

01:32:24.789 --> 01:32:26.874
Sixteen weeks
on the New York Times
bestseller list.

01:32:26.958 --> 01:32:28.667

to your discovery,
Doctor, because. . .

01:32:28.752 --> 01:32:31.003
This is for you.
I signed it.

01:32:34.341 --> 01:32:35.966
You're supposed
to say the title
and the publisher.

01:32:36.051 --> 01:32:37.718
That's not gonna happen.

01:32:37.802 --> 01:32:39.011
Just say it.
No.

01:32:39.095 --> 01:32:40.471
Just say the damn title.

01:32:40.555 --> 01:32:41.555
Fine.

Matt Lauer Can Suck It,
by Dr. Rick Marshall.

01:32:45.894 --> 01:32:48.520
I was so surprised
that your attorney
signed off on that.

01:32:48.605 --> 01:32:50.397
I was like, "Are you sure?
Is this gonna be okay?"

01:32:50.482 --> 01:32:51.857
He said, "Yeah, go for it."

01:32:51.942 --> 01:32:53.359

can you tell him
he forgot his egg?
