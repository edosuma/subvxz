WEBVTT

00:07.274 --> 00:08.774
(gasps)

00:08.776 --> 00:11.210
WHAT ON EARTH?

00:11.212 --> 00:12.745
IS THAT JOEY'S WALLET?

00:12.747 --> 00:15.481
-JOEY!
-(vocalizing tune)

00:17.318 --> 00:18.851
YOU BELLOWED, MOTHER?

00:18.853 --> 00:21.820
WHY DID YOU PUT
YOUR WALLET IN THE TOASTER?

00:21.822 --> 00:23.922
BECAUSE I DROPPED IT
IN THE TOILET.

00:23.924 --> 00:27.192
(chuckles) HOW ELSE
AM I SUPPOSED TO DRY IT?

00:27.194 --> 00:28.260
OH.

00:28.262 --> 00:30.329
JOEY IS VERY INTELLIGENT,

00:30.331 --> 00:32.264
HE'S ACING
COLLEGE-LEVEL MATH,

00:32.266 --> 00:33.966
BUT HE HAS
SOME BLIND SPOTS--

00:33.968 --> 00:37.736
COOKING, CLEANING
AND ANY BASIC LIFE SKILL.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.271
I MEAN, THIS IS
HIS TOOTHBRUSH.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.973
I BUY HIM
A NEW ONE EVERY WEEK.

00:40.975 --> 00:42.741
WHAT DOES HE DO?

00:42.743 --> 00:45.244
YES! IT CAME!

00:45.246 --> 00:46.979
THE INFORMATION PACKET
I REQUESTED

00:46.981 --> 00:49.815
FROM CALIFORNIA
UNIVERSITY OF LOS GATOS.

00:49.817 --> 00:52.684
CALIFORNIA?
WELL, I KNOW YOU'RE STARTING
TO LOOK AT COLLEGES,

00:52.686 --> 00:54.853
BUT THAT'S SO FAR AWAY.

00:54.855 --> 00:59.224
YEAH, BUT THEY HAVE
ONE OF THE BEST VIDEO GAME
DESIGN PROGRAMS IN THE NATION.

00:59.226 --> 01:03.896
-HMM.
-AND ALSO,  <i> LOS GATOS  </i> IS
<i>ESPANOL  </i> FOR "THE KITTIES."

01:03.898 --> 01:06.965
JOEY, DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
GONNA BE READY TO JUST...

01:06.967 --> 01:08.434
GO OFF ON YOUR OWN?

01:08.436 --> 01:10.402
MOM, ARE YOU KIDDING?

01:10.404 --> 01:12.271
I'M READY NOW.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.873
-(sizzling)
-OH! OW! OOH, MY HAND!
MY HAND! MY HAND!

01:14.875 --> 01:17.342
AH! MY HEINIE!
MY HEINIE! MY HEINIE!

02:16.804 --> 02:18.570
OKAY. YAY! YAY!

02:18.572 --> 02:19.972
WHAT DO WE ALL THINK
OF OUR NEW SONG?

02:19.974 --> 02:21.440
AND BEFORE ANY OF YOU ANSWER,

02:21.442 --> 02:22.808
KNOW THAT I TOTALLY THINK
WE CRUSHED IT,

02:22.810 --> 02:24.076
AND I WILL VERY MUCH
JUDGE YOU HARSHLY

02:24.078 --> 02:25.944
FOR NOT LOVING IT EQUALLY.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.347
I LOVE IT,

02:28.349 --> 02:29.581
AND NOT JUST BECAUSE
YOU THREATENED ME.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.416
(laughs) OKAY.

02:31.418 --> 02:33.318
I LOVE IT, TOO.

02:33.320 --> 02:34.853
OH, AND ANDIE'S BASS,
WHEN SHE WAS LIKE...

02:34.855 --> 02:38.090
(mimics bass playing)

02:39.360 --> 02:41.426
HOLDEN,
YOU'RE A WEIRDO,

02:41.428 --> 02:43.762
BUT YOU'RE MY WEIRDO.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.063
OH.

02:45.065 --> 02:47.533
(mimicking jet, gunfire)

02:51.572 --> 02:53.338
RED TEAM LEADER!
RED TEAM LEADER!

02:53.340 --> 02:55.107
STAY ON TARGET!
STAY ON TARGET!

02:56.443 --> 02:59.711
UH... I'M FILMING
A MOVIE HERE, PEOPLE.

02:59.713 --> 03:01.580
MOVE IT OR LOSE IT!

03:02.883 --> 03:05.817
WHOA. WHAT'S WITH
THE SUPER COOL CAMERA?

03:05.819 --> 03:08.954
OH, THE STUDENT FILM CLUB
IS MAKING A MOVIE
ABOUT EVIL ROBOTS,

03:08.956 --> 03:11.490
AND I HAPPEN TO HAVE
RECENTLY BUILT SIX.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.726
SO, I LET THEM
BORROW MY ROBOTS,

03:14.728 --> 03:18.363
AND THEY LET ME BORROW
A CAMERA AND THIS SUPER COOL
STEADICAM VEST.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.399
I FEEL LIKE
MINI IRON MAN.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.036
(laughs) WHOA!

03:24.038 --> 03:25.871
I JUST HAD A BRAIN...

03:25.873 --> 03:28.373
(mimics explosion)
...SPLOSION.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.676
WE SHOULD USE PARKER
AND HIS NEW SUPER COOL CAMERA

03:30.678 --> 03:32.477
TO HELP US SHOOT A MUSIC VIDEO
FOR OUR NEW SONG!

03:32.479 --> 03:34.379
NO!

03:34.381 --> 03:38.083
A MULTI-MEDIA
MUSIC FILM EXPERIENCE.

03:38.085 --> 03:40.953
UHH...

03:40.955 --> 03:42.154
OR WE COULD ALSO
JUST DO THE FIRST THING.

03:42.156 --> 03:44.623
LET'S JUST MAKE
A MUSIC VIDEO! YAY!

03:44.625 --> 03:48.493
(laughs)
WE CAN SHOOT IT IN
MY UNCLE'S OLD CHALK FACTORY.

03:48.495 --> 03:51.129
HE WENT BELLY UP,
BUT THERE WAS A TIME WHEN,

03:51.131 --> 03:53.432
IF YOU PLAYED
HOPSCOTCH IN WISCONSIN,

03:53.434 --> 03:54.900
YOU USED MY UNCLE'S CHALK.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.503
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S RUDE TO BRAG.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.206
PARKER, WILL YOU
FILM IT FOR US?

04:01.208 --> 04:03.609
I'LL DO IT
IF ANDIE REBUILDS MY BIKE.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.010
SURE, BUT WHAT
HAPPENED TO IT?

04:05.012 --> 04:07.546
OH, ONE OF MY ROBOTS
TORE IT APART.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.498
IN HINDSIGHT,

04:09.499 --> 04:11.449
I PROBABLY SHOULD NOT
HAVE MADE ALL MY ROBOTS EVIL.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.423
LET'S REVIEW
THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT

04:18.425 --> 04:20.125
FOR THE BATTLE
OF SPACE STATION X.

04:20.127 --> 04:22.060
AUBREY, STRIKE ARTIE
IN THE NECK.

04:22.062 --> 04:23.795
WHAT? OW!

04:25.799 --> 04:27.199
THAT IS NOT
A LEGAL HIT.

04:27.201 --> 04:28.800
THEN WHY'D
YOU MAKE HER DO IT?

04:28.802 --> 04:31.436
BECAUSE I HATE
YOUR STUPID NECK.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.106
AUBREY, STRIKE HIM
IN HIS STUPID KNEECAP.

04:34.108 --> 04:36.441
OW!

04:36.443 --> 04:39.177
ALSO NOT A LEGAL HIT!

04:39.179 --> 04:41.813
YOU KNOW
THOSE REALLY COOL KIDS

04:41.815 --> 04:43.882
YOU SEE IN THE PARK,
DRESSED UP,

04:43.884 --> 04:47.753
SWINGING FOAM SWORDS
AT EACH OTHER,
LOOKING AWESOME?

04:47.755 --> 04:51.456
THAT'S US,
THE INTERGALACTIC COUNCIL
OF RIDGEWOOD HIGH.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.692
YOU BETTER RECOGNIZE!

04:54.728 --> 04:55.961
OH.
(chuckles)

04:55.963 --> 04:57.696
HEY, INTERGALACTIC COUNCIL,

04:57.698 --> 04:59.665
LOOKS LIKE YOU ARE
WORKING UP QUITE AN APPETITE

04:59.667 --> 05:01.733
WITH YOUR DRESS-UP GAMES.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.737
I KNOW LIV AND MADDIE
ARE GONNA LEAVE HOME
BEFORE JOEY,

05:05.739 --> 05:07.806
BUT HE ISN'T PREPARED
FOR THE WORLD.

05:07.808 --> 05:11.176
IF I DON'T GET HIM READY,
HE'LL NEVER SURVIVE ON HIS OWN.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.678
DO YOU KNOW HOW LONG
IT TOOK ME

05:12.680 --> 05:14.846
TO GET HIM TO STOP
EATING THE WRAPPER ON CHEESE?

05:15.783 --> 05:17.149
YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT BE FUN?

05:17.151 --> 05:19.484
LEARNING HOW
TO BOIL WATER

05:19.486 --> 05:20.819
AND MAKE NOODLES!

05:20.821 --> 05:23.255
NO THANKS, MOM.

05:23.257 --> 05:27.759
TOMORROW WE'RE GOING UP
AGAINST THE INTERCOSMIC
FEDERATION OF MID-CITY HIGH...

05:27.761 --> 05:31.063
AND THE FATE
OF SPACE STATION X
HANGS IN THE BALANCE.

05:31.065 --> 05:34.733
ARTIE, STOP COMPLETING
MY SENTENCES.

05:36.003 --> 05:37.602
WE DON'T WANT
TO MAKE NOODLES...

05:37.604 --> 05:39.671
-WE WANT TO MAKE WAR!
-STOP IT!

05:42.242 --> 05:45.911
HEY, RO-BAT,
IS IT LEGAL TO POKE
SOMEONE IN THE EYE?

05:46.947 --> 05:48.814
DEMONSTRATE
AND WE'LL SEE.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.783
NO. NO. NO. NO.
(screams)

05:55.255 --> 05:57.055
-WHAT'S UP, LITTLE MAN?
-HEY, DIGGIE.

05:57.057 --> 06:00.625
WHOA. YOU FINALLY CUT
YOUR WEIRD TUNDRABANIAN
HAIR-BRAIDY THING.

06:02.363 --> 06:05.163
IT'S CALLED
A  <i> HARSKABUBEN...</i>

06:06.200 --> 06:08.633
AND NO, IT GOT
CAUGHT IN A CAR DOOR.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.271
OH, THAT'S HILAR-SKABUBEN.

06:13.273 --> 06:17.109
HEY, I KNOW
YOU BROKE UP WITH MADDIE,

06:17.111 --> 06:19.211
BUT WE CAN STILL
DO STUFF TOGETHER, RIGHT?

06:19.213 --> 06:20.679
YEAH, YEAH,
ABSOLUTELY.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.981
SO DO YOU WANT
TO HELP ME MAKE
A VIDEO FOR--

06:22.983 --> 06:24.049
NO.

06:25.586 --> 06:27.886
SHE'S BETTER OFF
WITHOUT YOU!

06:27.888 --> 06:30.856
HEY. WHO'S BETTER OFF
WITHOUT WHO?

06:30.858 --> 06:33.959
UH, I'M DEFINITELY NOT
BETTER OFF WITHOUT YOU

06:33.961 --> 06:37.162
HELPING ME MAKE A MUSIC VIDEO
FOR YOUR DEAR TWIN LIV.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.965
WHAT DO YOU SAY?
A LITTLE BROTHER-SISTER TIME?

06:39.967 --> 06:41.967
I HAVE NO ONE ELSE.
PLEASE SAY YES.

06:41.969 --> 06:44.269
(laughs)
YEAH, I'D LOVE TO.

06:44.271 --> 06:46.638
YES! WELCOME ABOARD!

06:46.640 --> 06:50.142
HEY, IF YOU GET BOSSY,
I WALK.

06:51.745 --> 06:53.845
SO, WHO WANTS TO MAKE

06:53.847 --> 06:56.081
-A MOVIE--
-I DO! I DO!
(clears throat)

06:58.285 --> 07:00.852
I DO.
SIGN ME UP, LITTLE MAN.

07:00.854 --> 07:03.622
SERIOUSLY?
WHY THE CHANGE OF HEART?

07:03.624 --> 07:07.092
(scoffs)
'CAUSE YOU'RE MY BOY.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.328
THAT SEEMED SUSPICIOUS,

07:10.330 --> 07:13.698
BUT I NEEDED TO MOVE
LIGHTING EQUIPMENT,
AND HE HAD A CAR,

07:13.700 --> 07:17.169
SO ONE TALL,
MYSTERIOUS DOOFUS-- CHECK.

07:17.171 --> 07:19.171
SO, WHO ELSE
IS SIGNING UP?

07:19.173 --> 07:21.139
LET'S SEE,
WE GOT YOU, ME...

07:21.141 --> 07:23.108
(laughs) MADDIE!

07:24.344 --> 07:25.877
LOOK AT THAT,
MADDIE SIGNED UP.

07:25.879 --> 07:28.013
WOW. COOL.
TOTALLY UNEXPECTED.

07:28.015 --> 07:31.149
SO WHY DON'T
WE ALL GET BURRITOS
AND MAKE A GAME PLAN.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.752
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
I'LL GET MY COAT,
YOU GET MADDIE. ALL RIGHT!

07:34.721 --> 07:38.156
HARSKA-BINGO!
MYSTERY SOLVED.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.325
DIGGIE MISSES MADDIE
AND WANTS TO USE

07:40.327 --> 07:42.961
MY FILM CREW AS AN EXCUSE
TO HANG OUT WITH HER.

07:43.897 --> 07:46.164
OH! GOOD! HI.
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.366
UM, I CAN'T HELP YOU
WITH YOUR VIDEO.

07:48.368 --> 07:50.969
I JUST REMEMBERED
THAT I COMMITTED TO TEACH

07:50.971 --> 07:52.370
KINDERGARTENERS HOW
TO PLAY BASKETBALL,

07:52.372 --> 07:54.306
AND I THINK I TECHNICALLY
COULD'VE GOTTEN OUT OF IT,

07:54.308 --> 07:56.074
BUT IF YOU DITCH LITTLE KIDS,
PEOPLE JUDGE YOU.

07:57.744 --> 08:00.779
DO I TELL DIGGIE
MADDIE WAS OUT?

08:01.448 --> 08:04.683
COME ON.
YOU KNOW ME
BETTER THAN THAT.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.018
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.

08:07.020 --> 08:10.956
-WHERE'S MADDIE?
-OH, MADDIE CAN'T, UH...

08:10.958 --> 08:13.291
MAKE IT TO BURRITOS,

08:13.293 --> 08:16.761
BUT SHE'LL TOTALLY
CATCH UP WITH US LATER.

08:17.731 --> 08:19.698
REALLY? YOU SURE?

08:19.700 --> 08:22.868
TRUST ME,
I'M YOUR BOY.

08:28.675 --> 08:31.343
(squeals)

08:31.345 --> 08:34.446
OH, YOUR UNCLE'S FACTORY
IS SO AWESOME.

08:34.448 --> 08:36.681
LET'S START TALKING
VIDEO IDEAS.

08:36.683 --> 08:39.384
READY, SET, BRAINSTORM.

08:40.787 --> 08:43.989
OKAY, I HAVE
THE PERFECT IDEA
FOR OUR VIDEO.

08:46.960 --> 08:49.461
EXTREME WATER SPORTS.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.432
IT'S THE DREAM
TO EXTREME!

08:56.436 --> 09:00.071
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO PLAY
THE BASS ON A JET SKI?

09:01.108 --> 09:02.507
TO THE EXTREME!

09:03.443 --> 09:05.043
IS THAT GONNA BE
YOUR ANSWER FOR EVERYTHING?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.811
TO THE EXTREME!

09:08.081 --> 09:11.349
OKAY, YOU WENT FIRST,
SO THAT'S HARD.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.387
HOW ABOUT THIS?
IN OUTER SPACE,

09:15.389 --> 09:18.857
THE ONLY SOUND
IS ROCK 'N' ROLL.

09:18.859 --> 09:20.725
WE HOOK OURSELVES
TO WIRES

09:20.727 --> 09:24.296
AND DO THE ENTIRE VIDEO
LIKE WE'RE IN ZERO GRAVITY.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.733
SWEET, HUH?

09:28.735 --> 09:30.101
(chuckles)

09:30.103 --> 09:33.838
YEAH, SO SEE,
AS A FORMER SPACE WEREWOLF,

09:33.840 --> 09:37.042
I THINK SPACE IS A LITTLE
BEEN THERE, ORBITED THAT.
YOU KNOW?

09:37.978 --> 09:40.211
BUT HERE IS AN IDEA

09:40.213 --> 09:42.881
THAT NEVER GOES
OUT OF STYLE.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.953
DANG IT! WRONG ONE.

09:50.290 --> 09:52.524
MAY I PRESENT TO YOU...

09:54.094 --> 09:55.360
LOVE.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.862
MAY I PRESENT TO YOU...

09:57.864 --> 09:59.397
HATE.

09:59.399 --> 10:02.934
(chuckles) OKAY.

10:02.936 --> 10:06.838
I THOUGHT THIS WAS
AN OPEN FORUM FOR IDEAS.

10:06.840 --> 10:10.108
IT IS, IT IS, EXCEPT WHEN
THE IDEAS ARE TERRIBLE!

10:12.045 --> 10:13.545
UNLIKE MINE...

10:13.547 --> 10:15.947
THE POWER OF MUSIC.

10:17.017 --> 10:19.784
THAT LOOKS LIKE AN AD
FOR A DENTIST'S OFFICE.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.320
(both laughing)

10:22.322 --> 10:24.089
WHY? BECAUSE IT'S NOT...

10:24.091 --> 10:25.557
(mockingly)
TO THE EXTREME!

10:25.559 --> 10:27.192
(laughs)

10:28.629 --> 10:32.030
ARE YOU MAKING FUN OF ME?
'CAUSE THAT'D BE THE BIGGEST
MISTAKE YOU EVER MADE.

10:32.032 --> 10:34.332
OH. OKAY.
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS.

10:34.334 --> 10:37.035
CALM DOWN, ALL RIGHT?
BOTH OF YOUR TERRIBLE IDEAS

10:37.037 --> 10:39.004
ARE STILL BETTER THAN LIV'S.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.538
-YEAH.
-(gasps)

10:40.540 --> 10:42.907
I WILL ERASE
YOUR GIANT MOUTH!

10:42.909 --> 10:44.109
WHOA, HOLD ON!
NO, YOU WON'T.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.910
(chattering)

10:48.315 --> 10:52.484
OKAY, GUYS,
THE INTERCOSMIC FEDERATION
WILL ATTACK AT ANY MOMENT.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.586
INTERGALACTIC COUNCIL...

10:54.588 --> 10:57.455
PREPARE FOR WAR!

10:58.392 --> 11:00.392
STOP DOING THAT.

11:00.394 --> 11:02.927
-SHOULD I HIT HIM IN THE NECK?
-I WON'T STOP YOU.

11:02.929 --> 11:04.429
OW!

11:06.533 --> 11:10.201
NEVER FEAR,
TRISTAN LYCANTH IS HERE.

11:11.838 --> 11:15.874
I REALIZED THAT
THE ONLY WAY TO TEACH JOEY
THE LIFE SKILLS HE NEEDS

11:15.876 --> 11:17.876
WAS TO DO IT IN A LANGUAGE
HE COULD UNDERSTAND.

11:17.878 --> 11:19.411
AND LET'S BE HONEST,

11:19.413 --> 11:21.946
MY BOY SPEAKS FLUENT GEEK.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.948
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:23.950 --> 11:27.018
JOINING YOU IN YOUR FIGHT
FOR SPACE STATION X!

11:27.020 --> 11:29.988
-(giggles)
-UH, THAT'S GREAT,

11:29.990 --> 11:34.292
BUT THIS BATTLE TAKES PLACE
IN THE NEBULON GALAXY WHERE...

11:34.294 --> 11:37.862
-NOTHING OVER 40 LIVES.
-(scoffs)

11:37.864 --> 11:39.898
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT DOES LIVE?

11:39.900 --> 11:43.101
PESKY BODY ODOR
IN A POLYESTER SPACE OUTFIT.

11:43.103 --> 11:45.904
IT'S A GOOD THING I BROUGHT
MY STAIN STICK. ARMS UP.

11:45.906 --> 11:49.441
LET'S LEARN HOW
TO PRETREAT THESE PITS.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.343
MOM, QUIT IT!

11:52.345 --> 11:53.978
-HM-MMM.
-(fanfare)

11:56.383 --> 11:59.150
Aubrey:
THE INTERCOSMIC
FEDERATION APPROACHES!

11:59.152 --> 12:01.352
READY YOUR WEAPONS.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.722
COULD YOU...?

12:04.658 --> 12:06.958
-(beeps)
-(distorted)
READY YOUR WEAPONS.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.026
(giggles)

12:08.962 --> 12:11.196
NO, NO. NO, NO, NO.
YOU JUST STAY BACK HERE

12:11.198 --> 12:12.664
WHERE YOU'LL BE SAFE

12:12.666 --> 12:15.066
AND WHERE I WILL BE
LESS EMBARRASSED.

12:17.003 --> 12:20.405
-DIE, INTERCOSMIC SCUM!
-(yelling)

12:22.542 --> 12:25.009
-(screaming)
-Karen: WAIT!

12:25.946 --> 12:29.013
Karen:
WAIT! WAIT!

12:29.015 --> 12:32.350
-WAIT!
-(continues screaming)

12:35.655 --> 12:37.989
(chuckles, growls)

12:37.991 --> 12:41.659
WOULDN'T IT BE BETTER
TO SETTLE THIS DISAGREEMENT

12:41.661 --> 12:44.062
BY TALKING IT OUT
LIKE MATURE ADULTS?

12:44.064 --> 12:46.231
(whining)
MOM, YOU'RE RUINING
OUR BATTLE.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.700
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.
I DON'T THINK SO. NO.

12:48.702 --> 12:50.935
WE ARE GONNA USE
OUR WORDS.

12:50.937 --> 12:54.172
RO-BAT, WHAT DO YOU
HAVE TO SAY TO...

12:54.174 --> 12:56.107
TO SKY ZOMBIE?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.978
-SKY ZOMBIE,
YOU'RE NOT MY ENEMY.
-Karen: YES.

12:59.980 --> 13:02.747
-I DON'T WANT TO FIGHT YOU.
-THAT'S A REAL GOOD START, JOEY.

13:02.749 --> 13:05.049
-I WANT TO FIGHT HER.
-WHAT?

13:05.051 --> 13:07.619
-ATTACK!
-NO!

13:07.621 --> 13:10.421
-(kids yelling)
-ALWAYS CLEAN
BEHIND YOUR EARS! NO!

13:10.423 --> 13:12.056
WAIT!

13:14.694 --> 13:17.662
DON'T YOU DARE ERASE
MY GIANT MOUTH!

13:17.664 --> 13:22.000
-I FORBID IT.
-(guffaws) YOU FORBID IT?

13:22.002 --> 13:26.104
OKAY, YOU ARE
ABOUT ONE FOOT TOO SHORT
TO BE MY DAD, DIPPLEDORF.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.541
LIV, IF YOU TOUCH HIS BOARD,
I'LL ERASE WILLOW'S.

13:29.543 --> 13:33.378
-(gasps) MINE? WHY?
-BECAUSE IT'S SO DUMB,
IT MAKES ME MAD.

13:35.048 --> 13:37.715
-MY MOM SAYS THAT
I'M STILL GROWING,
-(scoffs)

13:37.717 --> 13:41.252
NOBODY CARES, HOLDEN.
NOBODY CARES.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.488
(all shouting)

13:43.490 --> 13:46.658
(screeching)

13:51.164 --> 13:53.031
YOU ALL KNOW ME.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.168
I CAN HELP YOU
MAKE THIS VIDEO, BUT...

13:57.170 --> 13:58.536
YOU'RE ROWING ONE BOAT

13:58.538 --> 14:01.239
(emphatically)
IN FOUR DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.075
GET YOUR BAND IN ORDER.

14:04.077 --> 14:07.312
IN THE MEANTIME,
DIGGIE AND I ARE GOING
FOR PANCAKES!

14:07.314 --> 14:09.280
(grunts)

14:09.282 --> 14:11.783
'CAUSE MADDIE'S GONNA
BE THERE TOO, RIGHT?

14:11.785 --> 14:15.119
YEAH. SHE'LL MEET US THERE...
PROBABLY.

14:15.121 --> 14:16.721
-BRING YOUR WALLET, KID.
-OKAY.

14:21.528 --> 14:24.462
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAKING A VIDEO WAS
A BAD IDEA.

14:24.464 --> 14:28.032
YEAH. MAYBE WE AREN'T
MEANT TO BE IN A BAND
IF WE CAN'T WORK TOGETHER.

14:29.236 --> 14:32.036
LET'S FACE IT:
THE DREAM IS DEAD.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.805
OKAY, WAIT.
(chuckles)

14:33.807 --> 14:35.707
YOU GUYS DON'T REALLY THINK

14:35.708 --> 14:37.608
THAT WE'RE BETTER OFF APART
THAN WE ARE TOGETHER, RIGHT?

14:37.611 --> 14:41.312
YUP. I'M GOING HOME
TO PLAY THE DRUMS BY MYSELF.

14:42.249 --> 14:45.350
REALLY?
DO YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT THAT SOUNDS LIKE?

14:46.686 --> 14:50.054
(clears throat)
THIS IS JUST WILLOW.

14:50.056 --> 14:52.824
(drums playing)

14:54.394 --> 14:57.262
HERE IS JUST... ANDIE.

14:57.264 --> 15:00.531
(bass playing)

15:02.302 --> 15:04.836
AND THIS IS JUST HOLDEN.

15:04.838 --> 15:09.207
<i>♪ I love froyo,</i>
<i>oh, oh, oh ♪</i>

15:09.209 --> 15:12.777
- <i> ♪ I love froyo ♪</i>
-(nervous laughter)

15:12.779 --> 15:14.646
(clears throat)

15:14.648 --> 15:16.481
IT'S THE WRONG SONG.

15:19.352 --> 15:21.219
THIS IS JUST HOLDEN.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.488
-(guitar playing)
-(sighs)

15:25.792 --> 15:29.360
AND HERE IS
ALL OF US... TOGETHER.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.162
<i>♪ Say hey, hey, hey ♪</i>

15:31.164 --> 15:33.564
<i>♪ We're gonna make</i>

15:33.566 --> 15:36.100
<i>♪ Just dance</i>

15:39.806 --> 15:41.406
- <i> ♪ We're living for... ♪</i>
-(chuckles)

15:41.408 --> 15:44.409
YOU'RE RIGHT, LIV.
WE'RE BETTER TOGETHER.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.477
AND WE'RE GONNA
STAY TOGETHER.

15:46.479 --> 15:49.380
-(chuckles)
-YEAH. I MEAN,
ALL WE NEED TO DO

15:49.382 --> 15:51.482
IS COME UP WITH A NEW IDEA
THAT WE ALL LOVE.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.420
(clapping)

16:00.694 --> 16:04.195
AND THE BABY TAKES
ITS FIRST STEPS.

16:05.498 --> 16:07.532
NOW GET TO WORK!

16:09.135 --> 16:11.269
-(screeches)
-OH GOD!

16:11.271 --> 16:12.770
OOH!

16:17.444 --> 16:18.576
HEY, MOM.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.445
LOOK, THINGS GOT
CARRIED AWAY

16:20.447 --> 16:22.313
IN THE HEAT
OF THE BATTLE TODAY,

16:22.315 --> 16:25.550
AND I AM SORRY
FOR SPACE-SLAUGHTERING YOU.

16:25.552 --> 16:28.486
MMM. THAT'S OKAY.
I HAD IT COMING.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.888
I SHOULD'VE KNOWN
YOU DIDN'T NEED ANY HELP.

16:30.890 --> 16:33.291
SO, AS IT TURNS OUT,

16:33.293 --> 16:35.526
I DESTROYED
MY MOTHER'S SOUL.

16:35.528 --> 16:38.730
RO-BAT IS
THE SAVIOR OF SOULS,
NOT THE DESTROYER.

16:38.732 --> 16:41.366
THAT IS
CAPTAIN SOUL DESTROYER.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.469
LOOK, MOM,
I WANNA SAY SOMETHING,

16:44.471 --> 16:46.537
BUT I DO NOT WANT YOU
TO TAKE IT THE WRONG WAY,

16:46.539 --> 16:49.340
SO I'M GONNA SAY IT
WHILE HUGGING.

16:49.342 --> 16:52.610
COME HERE. (sighs)

16:52.612 --> 16:55.546
OH. THIS IS NICE.

16:55.548 --> 16:58.816
GOOD. I'M GONNA NEED YOU
IN A PLACE WHERE
YOU CAN HEAR ME.

16:58.818 --> 17:01.519
YOU ARE DRIVING ME CRAZY.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.789
BACK UP OFF MY GRILL,
YOU HELICOPTER HOVERING
WHACKADOO.

17:07.894 --> 17:09.494
I'M SORRY.

17:09.496 --> 17:12.330
I'VE JUST BEEN WORRIED
ABOUT YOU GOING OFF
TO COLLEGE.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.198
I HAVEN'T PREPARED YOU
FOR THE WORLD!

17:14.200 --> 17:17.502
MOM, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT PREPARING ME
FOR THE WORLD.

17:17.504 --> 17:21.372
YOU HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT
PREPARING THE WORLD FOR ME.

17:22.876 --> 17:24.809
I'M AN UNSTOPPABLE FORCE.

17:25.979 --> 17:28.880
YOU ARE,
AND I LOVE YOU FOR IT.

17:28.882 --> 17:31.449
(chuckles)
BUT YOUR SHIRT IS ON
INSIDE OUT.

17:31.451 --> 17:32.850
DANG IT!

17:38.892 --> 17:41.359
HEY, WHAT DO WE HAVE
THIS GREEN WALL FOR?

17:41.361 --> 17:43.594
HEY, YOU GUYS CAME UP
WITH THE PLAN FOR THE VIDEO.

17:43.596 --> 17:46.364
IF YOU WANT SPECIAL EFFECTS,
YOU NEED A GREEN SCREEN.

17:46.366 --> 17:49.734
NOW MARCH DOWN TO THE CAR
AND HELP LIV AND WILLOW
GET THE REST OF IT!

17:49.736 --> 17:52.270
(amplified)
I NEED IT HERE YESTERDAY!

17:55.608 --> 17:59.010
YOU'RE KIND OF A...
FROSTY LITTLE DUDE,
AREN'T YA?

18:00.246 --> 18:01.779
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST PERSON
TO SAY THAT.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.317
(grunts)
HEY, I'M SO GLAD
YOU GUYS ARE HERE.

18:06.319 --> 18:08.553
DO YOU JUST MIND
HELPING ME WITH ONE
OR TWO OF THESE...

18:08.555 --> 18:09.620
OF THESE...

18:10.757 --> 18:12.356
THAT'S FINE. I GOT IT.

18:15.562 --> 18:16.794
WHOO!

18:16.796 --> 18:19.597
OKAY.
(exasperated sigh)

18:19.599 --> 18:21.666
DO WE REALLY NEED
ALL THIS GEAR?

18:21.668 --> 18:24.836
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T HEAR YOU.
DO YOU KNOW WHY?

18:24.838 --> 18:28.372
(amplified)
BECAUSE SOMEONE HASN'T
SET UP THE SPEAKERS YET!

18:29.509 --> 18:33.377
USUALLY, I'D BE NERVOUS ABOUT
YELLING AT SOMEONE THAT BIG,

18:33.379 --> 18:36.347
BUT DIGGIE'S GOT IT
PRETTY BAD FOR MADDIE,

18:36.349 --> 18:38.683
SO I WILL TREAT HIM
AS I CHOOSE.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.987
OKAY, WHERE ARE
THE SPEAKERS?

18:42.989 --> 18:46.691
PROBABLY NEXT
TO THE GIANT SPEAKERS
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.993
(amplified)
CHOP-CHOP!

18:50.697 --> 18:53.698
(phone rings)

18:53.700 --> 18:55.466
<i>Hey, 'Sup, lil bro?</i>

18:55.468 --> 18:57.735
<i>I just wanted to say</i>
<i>that I'm really sorry</i>

18:57.737 --> 18:59.437
<i>that I couldn't help you</i>
<i>with your video.</i>

19:04.644 --> 19:07.612
WHAT? I MEAN--
I MEAN, BYE, MA--

19:07.614 --> 19:10.748
I MEAN MARK,
MY FRIEND MARK
WITH THE GIRL VOICE.

19:14.787 --> 19:17.889
-HEY.
-HEY.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.659
SO, WHAT ARE THE ODDS
THAT YOU BOUGHT THAT?

19:21.661 --> 19:24.996
PROBABLY ABOUT THE SAME
AS YOU NOT GETTING
A WEDGIE RIGHT NOW.

19:24.998 --> 19:28.933
NO, OKAY,
JUST HEAR ME OUT. I...

19:28.935 --> 19:30.635
PARKER!

19:34.407 --> 19:36.674
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

19:36.676 --> 19:39.443

22:16.002 --> 22:18.602

22:18.604 --> 22:21.706

22:39.792 --> 22:42.860
ABOUT HOW MADDIE WANTS YOU
TO COME TO THE BACK DOOR
WITH A PIZZA.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.965
-YEAH, SO WHERE IS SHE?
-OH, HERE'S THE THING:

22:47.967 --> 22:50.201
SHE JUST LEFT FOR A RUN.

22:50.203 --> 22:52.703
BUT IF YOU HURRY,
YOU CAN CATCH HER.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.072
-REALLY? WOW.
OKAY, THANK YOU.
-OH, WAIT.

22:55.074 --> 22:58.275
DO YOU WANT ME
TO HOLD THE PIZZA
SO IT DOESN'T SLOW YOU DOWN?

23:04.984 --> 23:07.785
YOU REALLY ARE MY BOY.

23:10.289 --> 23:13.824
AH, POOR, LOVESICK DOOFUS.

23:16.229 --> 23:19.697
-HEY, DO I SMELL PIZZA?

23:22.168 --> 23:25.136
