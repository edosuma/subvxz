[Ana] What's this?

10:28.628 --> 10:30.379
[in Spanish] Since you didn't come home
last night

10:30.463 --> 10:33.049
like a dignified,
well-mannered young lady...

10:33.382 --> 10:35.051
I imagined you must have moved out.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.011
Maybe to Hawaii? What do I know?

10:37.345 --> 10:38.888
God almighty, you're so dramatic.

10:38.971 --> 10:40.431
I'm going to my room now.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.725
I packed up all of your junk.

10:42.808 --> 10:44.477
Very neatly packed, too.

10:44.560 --> 10:47.396
Yeah. What would I ever do
without my 50 rosaries?

10:47.480 --> 10:48.981
To scare the devil out of you, cabrona!

10:49.065 --> 10:50.316
OK, fine, look, I'm sorry.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.653
But I brought your favorito,

10:54.195 --> 10:55.279
tres leches.

10:55.821 --> 10:56.656
Sí?

10:56.781 --> 10:58.115
Is it like a Rosca de Reyes?

10:58.699 --> 10:59.909
If I take a bite,

11:00.034 --> 11:02.370
-will the rent money magically appear?
-No.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.038
No, but these are amazing leftovers!

11:04.121 --> 11:06.040
-Look, there's tamales, arroz.
-Just a second.

11:06.123 --> 11:07.500
Ana, do I look like a fool to you?

11:07.583 --> 11:09.752
Ma, these leftovers
will feed us for a week!

11:09.835 --> 11:10.961
They just made us a deal.

11:11.045 --> 11:11.879
Incredible.

11:12.171 --> 11:15.174
That little job you found
pays you in leftovers.

11:15.257 --> 11:18.511
-[sighs] It's not like that, Mom.
-Hold on.

11:19.845 --> 11:20.846
Who are you calling?

11:21.305 --> 11:22.598
Hello? Mr. Edison.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.142
We're gonna pay the light bill

11:25.601 --> 11:26.769
with payments of beans.

11:27.603 --> 11:29.689
OK, you can tell Mr. Edison I get it.

11:29.772 --> 11:31.941
Oh! You want it all in one big sack?

11:32.024 --> 11:33.526
Of course! Not a problem.

11:33.609 --> 11:35.319
OK, fine! More tres leches for me!

11:35.403 --> 11:36.737
You better save me some!

11:37.613 --> 11:38.948
-[door slams shut]
-Babosa.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.791

-[grunts]

11:49.208 --> 11:50.042
Vampire.

11:50.126 --> 11:52.712
This isn't a hotel.
Get up and put some pants on.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.463
I don't do pants anymore.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.048
[in English] I don't do pants anymore.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.049
[in Spanish] Drink this.

11:57.133 --> 11:57.967
What is it?

11:58.426 --> 11:59.552
-Witchcraft.
-[spits]

11:59.885 --> 12:01.846
-[Casimiro] Listen. Hey!
-[groans]

12:02.346 --> 12:05.599
Listen, you and I had an agreement. Sí?

12:05.850 --> 12:09.019
You're living in this house rent-free
because you have a dream, lazy-ass.

12:09.353 --> 12:11.605
But right now you're acting
like Cheechy Chong.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.899
Cheech and Chong, Pop. It's two people.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.401
That's not important.

12:15.526 --> 12:16.736
They're both lazy asses.

12:16.986 --> 12:18.612
I need you to help out at the taco shop.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.573
You know we tried that, Pop.

12:20.656 --> 12:22.032
Erik doesn't want me in the shop,

12:22.366 --> 12:24.452
and nobody gets my superior taste palate.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.287
Stop making excuses.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.788
Just stop...

12:27.997 --> 12:29.165
Don Zacazonapan.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.708
Are you a chef? Then get back to it!

12:30.791 --> 12:33.586
Or who do you think you are?
The prince of Idaho?

12:34.253 --> 12:35.087
I don't know

12:35.838 --> 12:37.256
what I am anymore.

12:37.631 --> 12:38.591
I'm not asking you.

12:43.804 --> 12:46.182
[Casimiro] Alright, listen to Norma.
She's the boss.

12:46.557 --> 12:48.476
And try to have fun, cabrón.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.019
Remember, this is what you're good at.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.104
Just stay away from the blender.

12:52.646 --> 12:53.773
Where are you going?

12:53.856 --> 12:55.149
What's it to you, Cheechy?

12:55.608 --> 12:57.943
Geez, I should have brought your pacifier.

12:59.361 --> 13:01.280
Well, don't just stand there, baboso,
go and make yourself useful.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.657
Do some inventory.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.868
There's some carne asada
and some masa that goes bad today.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.329
We have to throw it away
to make room for the next delivery.

13:08.954 --> 13:10.122
You're throwing away product?

13:12.416 --> 13:14.585
How long has the shop
been throwing away unused food?

13:15.503 --> 13:17.296
Pues, for a while now?

13:17.588 --> 13:19.006
Since business has been slow.

13:20.925 --> 13:21.884
Can I try something?

13:23.761 --> 13:25.763
["Tres Tiros" by Sr Ortegon

13:29.517 --> 13:30.768
That's what I'm saying, fool.

13:36.106 --> 13:37.566
What the hell are Pop's Pies?

13:38.400 --> 13:40.236
[sniffing]

13:40.402 --> 13:42.530
Yo, these are fire.

13:43.239 --> 13:45.407
Let me get on this Pop Pie love.

13:45.491 --> 13:46.909
I'll do all the marketing.

13:47.117 --> 13:49.286
Pops could be like the next Patti LaBelle.

13:51.872 --> 13:54.083
Whussup, mija. Let me get a little sample.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.251
A little sample.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.628
Hey, what the hell's going on out there?

13:57.711 --> 13:59.880
Hey, listen, man.
I don't want any trouble, OK?

13:59.964 --> 14:02.258
-Pop begged me to come help.
-Oh, he begged you, huh?

14:02.591 --> 14:05.177
And you, something wrong with the food
I cook or what?

14:05.261 --> 14:06.345
Hey, no.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.222
Este güey just made carne asada pot pie

14:08.305 --> 14:09.974
with the masa that was gonna go bad.

14:10.057 --> 14:10.891
Hey.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.059
He called it a "Pop Pie."

14:12.142 --> 14:13.769
You get it? Pop Pie?!

14:13.853 --> 14:15.229
Ahh! [laughs]

14:17.064 --> 14:18.107
So what? The güero's cool now

14:18.190 --> 14:20.651
and I'm axed out because
I didn't go to the Pop Pie convention?

14:21.068 --> 14:22.903
[in Spanish] Calm down now, loudmouth.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.781
I was just trying to get him out
of the house and look how well it's going.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.950
What the fuck?

14:28.284 --> 14:29.702
He fucked with the menu and shit,

14:29.785 --> 14:31.203
and then rearranged the kitchen.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.747
And what part of Mexico
are pies from anyway?

14:33.831 --> 14:35.666
He's saved us a ton of money.

14:35.749 --> 14:37.751
What have you done for the shop today?

14:41.755 --> 14:43.090
I got ideas too, Pop.

14:43.340 --> 14:44.425
Yeah,

14:44.717 --> 14:45.593
I'm handing shit.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.682
Oh, looks like he's got it covered.

-[chuckles] Gracias.
-[Clerk] Next, please.

-No. This is--
-Alex.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.979

Hi, Alex.

17:50.402 --> 17:51.236
Nice to meet you.

17:52.446 --> 17:53.280
So, Lidia,

17:54.031 --> 17:56.533
how's everything going
with having my cousin's baby?

18:00.412 --> 18:02.164
-Hm.
-[chuckles]

18:02.331 --> 18:03.791
I'm gonna use the restroom.

18:04.833 --> 18:05.667

18:07.920 --> 18:08.754
I don't like him.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.965
-I don't like him.
-Chris, tone down the aggro.

18:13.801 --> 18:14.635
I'm sorry.

18:15.219 --> 18:16.929
What's up with this Alex cat, huh?

18:17.262 --> 18:19.098
You know he's taking
a massive dump right now.

18:19.348 --> 18:20.599
That's just--
That's a dick move.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.684
He's helping me
with a job application to Stanford.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.311
What?

18:24.728 --> 18:25.604
Stanford?

18:26.647 --> 18:27.731

18:27.815 --> 18:29.274
That's not even a real city.

And what about Erik?

18:32.569 --> 18:34.947
I have someone else's future
to think about, not just mine.

I know you're pissed
about the other night at Mangia,

18:37.241 --> 18:39.159
but it wasn't his fault, I fucked up.

18:39.243 --> 18:40.077
It's not just that.

18:40.577 --> 18:42.079
Erik has a lot of growing up to do,

18:42.162 --> 18:43.664
-and you know that.
-Yeah. Look,

18:44.123 --> 18:45.916
does he have quirks? Yeah, but...

18:46.542 --> 18:47.417
he's trying.

18:47.876 --> 18:49.962
I mean, he's cut down
to smoking two blunts a day.

18:50.045 --> 18:51.755
-[scoffs]
-He filed his taxes this year.

18:51.839 --> 18:53.423
He even bought floss the other day.

18:53.757 --> 18:54.591
Yeah.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.677
Yeah, he hasn't used it yet, but it is

18:56.760 --> 18:57.845
only a matter of time.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.096
That is really cute,

18:59.346 --> 19:01.056
but floss won't raise a baby.

19:01.348 --> 19:02.432
Look, Lidia,

19:03.183 --> 19:04.601
I don't get a lot about him, but...

19:05.435 --> 19:07.604
there's one thing I have never doubted:

19:08.730 --> 19:09.565
You're it for him.

19:10.274 --> 19:11.441
I know that much for sure.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.237
Anyway, just think about it. OK?
