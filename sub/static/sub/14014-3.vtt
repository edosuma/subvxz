<i>(male narrator)</i>
<i>In the criminal</i>
<i>justice system...</i>

00:25.925 --> 00:29.588
<i>the people are represented</i>
<i>by two separate</i>
<i>yet equally important groups:</i>

00:29.662 --> 00:31.562
<i>The police</i>
<i>who investigate crime...</i>

00:31.631 --> 00:34.327
<i>and the district attorneys</i>
<i>who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:34.401 --> 00:36.096
<i>These are their stories.</i>

00:46.913 --> 00:50.940
First time I heard this,
I was in my parent's basement
with Shelly Fern.

00:51.017 --> 00:53.178
Sixth grade,
you listened to Sinatra?

00:53.253 --> 00:56.154
My brother, he was in tenth.
He said it never fails.

00:57.924 --> 00:58.948
[Groaning]

00:59.025 --> 01:01.926
I love hotels,
they make me horny.

01:02.495 --> 01:03.985
This is last call.

01:04.063 --> 01:06.658
I thought this was the city
that never sleeps.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.598
The city doesn't, I do.

01:09.436 --> 01:11.563
Does she have a name?

01:11.838 --> 01:14.329
She's been sitting alone
for the last hour.

01:15.442 --> 01:17.376
I'm a perfect cure for that.

01:19.946 --> 01:21.243
[Clears throat]

01:25.251 --> 01:27.412
You from out of town?

01:29.456 --> 01:31.617
Me and my friend,
we're from Elmira.

01:32.158 --> 01:35.093
I know it sounds corny
but we're kind of overwhelmed.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.689
Maybe you could show us...
Please, leave me alone.

01:39.365 --> 01:41.833
How about a refill?
Hey, Dave.

01:42.202 --> 01:44.432
You want a drink? Here.

01:46.873 --> 01:47.965
[Crashing]

01:49.309 --> 01:51.243
I just want to go home.

01:51.744 --> 01:55.339
Look, miss,
maybe the gentleman
was a little out of line.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.849
It's no reason
to get violent.

01:59.385 --> 02:02.548
In the future,
I suggest you take
your business elsewhere.

02:04.157 --> 02:07.388
Business?
Honey, it's after 1:00.
You're alone.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.694
I want to make a phone call.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.598
[Phone rattles]

02:21.374 --> 02:24.571
Yes.
I'd like to report a rape.

02:25.945 --> 02:27.708
At the Radcliffe Hotel.

02:29.382 --> 02:33.148
Her name is Julia Wood, 19,
junior at Bradfield College.

02:33.219 --> 02:35.244
She says it happened
in one of the hotel suites.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.913
So how bad did it happen?

02:36.990 --> 02:40.187
Positive for semen.
There's some vaginal bruising.

02:40.493 --> 02:43.155
She says it was rape.
And you're not buying it?

02:43.396 --> 02:45.956
She's definitely upset. Rape?

02:46.232 --> 02:50.259
My mother told me that ladies
don't go to rock stars'
hotel suites after midnight.

02:50.336 --> 02:53.430
Wanna give me a hint?
She claims it was C-Square.

02:54.073 --> 02:56.598
She's sedated now.
You'll have to come back.

02:56.843 --> 03:00.904
C-Square?
Smile, Lennie. Heavy metal.

03:00.980 --> 03:03.471
Your kids will probably
want his autograph.

03:52.365 --> 03:54.230
Four platinum records.

03:54.968 --> 03:56.959
You know what kind
of money that is?

03:57.036 --> 04:00.164
Lt'll keep his
great-great-grandchildren
driving Bentleys.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.902
I'm glad about his future.
What about his past?

04:03.676 --> 04:06.839
His real name is, get this...

04:07.213 --> 04:08.646
Clarence Carmichael.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.513
He was born right here
in Hell's Kitchen.
Now he lives in L.A.

04:11.584 --> 04:15.645
Besides being number one
on Tipper Gore's hit list
for dirty words, nothing.

04:16.022 --> 04:19.014
Rock 'r roll rapist.
Not much in
the initial report.

04:19.091 --> 04:22.528
We got some pictures here,
but they don't really
take us anyplace.

04:22.595 --> 04:24.119
I see a lot of
black and blue.

04:24.197 --> 04:26.062
(Logan)
Shoulders, upper arms.

04:26.399 --> 04:28.424
This guy C-Square
weighs a 180.

04:28.501 --> 04:31.334
According to that report,
she was 100 soaking wet.

04:31.604 --> 04:35.040
The doctors
can ascertain intercourse,
but not necessarily rape.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.271
Yeah. I picked
this up on the way in.

04:38.344 --> 04:40.744
Have you ever had
a look at this guy?

04:43.950 --> 04:46.441
dd <i>[music playing]</i>

04:53.293 --> 04:56.285

04:56.596 --> 05:00.123

05:20.920 --> 05:23.013
Great lyrics.
Early Cole Porter.

05:23.089 --> 05:26.286
Okay, okay, so what?
Being hairy
gets him 25-to-life?

05:26.359 --> 05:29.817
Just thinking
maybe he puts his monkey
where his mouth is.

05:32.498 --> 05:35.865
He came to my dorm.
He said we were going dancing.

05:38.204 --> 05:39.899
In his hotel room?

05:41.741 --> 05:44.301
He's rich. He's famous.

05:44.811 --> 05:47.302
Why would anyone believe
a normal person like me?

05:47.380 --> 05:50.349
We believe you, Julia,
but we have to ask.

05:53.019 --> 05:55.453
He was gonna
give me tickets to a concert.

05:56.889 --> 06:00.985
He said they were in his room,
the suite where
the President stayed.

06:01.928 --> 06:04.192
He said I'd get a kick
out of seeing it.

06:04.263 --> 06:06.197
And when you got up there?

06:11.838 --> 06:13.567
When he was done...

06:15.508 --> 06:18.204
he told me I could
find cab fare in his pocket.

06:20.513 --> 06:22.947
Did you scream
or try to get away?

06:26.386 --> 06:28.013
(Logan)
Look, Julia...

06:29.989 --> 06:32.480
we're not saying
that this didn't happen...

06:33.259 --> 06:37.320
but I got to tell you,
everybody knows his act.

06:37.764 --> 06:41.723
What's a jury gonna think,
they know you went
up to his room at that hour?

06:42.935 --> 06:46.496
He can have
any woman he wants.
Why did he do this to me?

06:49.108 --> 06:52.544
So this is why they bounced us
from the presidential suite,
eh?

06:53.279 --> 06:55.008
It's a crime scene.
They have to check it out.

06:55.081 --> 06:58.744
The crime is you guys
waking me up before noon,
okay?

07:00.720 --> 07:01.812
Hey.

07:04.023 --> 07:06.491
This is a fairy tale.
The girl's nuts.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.084
Me, I was up for dancing.

07:10.196 --> 07:12.289
But what's-her-face
had other plans.

07:12.365 --> 07:16.495
So you admit
you went to bed with her?
Yeah. Why wouldn't I?

07:16.669 --> 07:21.072
Well, because Julia
said that this is a bad case
of life imitating art.

07:21.140 --> 07:23.108
I write what sells, man.

07:23.709 --> 07:26.473
Doesrt mean I live it. Okay?
Okay.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.474
Last night,
little Miss College,
dressed up like that <i>...</i>

07:32.285 --> 07:34.253
I guess I was wrong.

07:34.320 --> 07:36.720
She said all she wanted
was some tickets.

07:37.190 --> 07:40.717
She came up to my room
to get her eyeballs
put on the ceiling, okay?

07:40.793 --> 07:42.260
(Logan)
Take it easy.

07:42.528 --> 07:46.055
What, did you get up
on the wrong side of your cage
this morning?

07:46.199 --> 07:47.689
Hey, Teddy...

07:49.802 --> 07:51.326
don't we have lawyers
for this?

07:51.404 --> 07:53.304
Yeah. It's okay, Clarence.
Right.

07:53.372 --> 07:57.274
It's obvious what crap's
going down here.
It is? Fill us in.

07:57.410 --> 08:01.813
Clarence is in town to sign
a six-album, $20-million deal.

08:02.682 --> 08:05.810
You got to see your Miss Wood
wants a little piece.

08:05.885 --> 08:09.321
So it's extortion, not rape?
Like that never happened?

08:09.388 --> 08:13.484
I been in the business
10 years, the last two with
Clarence. Give me a break.

08:13.559 --> 08:15.322
Just check her out.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.392
(Logan)
You know, my cousin
used to play bass in a band.

08:19.465 --> 08:22.798
Biggest joint they ever booked
was Louie's on Varick Street.

08:23.035 --> 08:25.833
They couldn't even
get a record company guy
to look at them.

08:25.905 --> 08:28.738
So now he's pumping gas?
Booze.

08:28.875 --> 08:32.504
But I got to tell you,
something about
rock 'r roll <i>...</i>

08:32.645 --> 08:36.672
The chicks that used
to line up at his dressing
room door was unbelievable.

08:36.749 --> 08:39.980
Yeah, but Julia's
not like the ones we saw
hanging with the band.

08:40.052 --> 08:43.818
Just 'cause she wears
pleated skirts doesn't mean
she listens to Barry Manilow.

08:43.890 --> 08:46.051
You know,
most rape victims...

08:46.125 --> 08:48.889
they run home, grab a shower,
call a close friend.

08:48.961 --> 08:51.293
Julia heads
straight for a bar.

08:51.831 --> 08:54.925
Where the bartender said
she had a couple on the rocks.

08:55.268 --> 08:58.032
I wonder how many she had
to warm up with?

09:01.941 --> 09:05.104
Julia, Marti, and I
had an English exam
in the morning...

09:05.177 --> 09:08.578
and we went over to One Fifth
for lunch. You know,
kind of a celebration.

09:08.648 --> 09:12.015
Yeah? Did you talk
the bartender into giving
you a couple of bloody marys?

09:12.084 --> 09:15.520
We had cobb salads
and club soda.

09:15.955 --> 09:18.116
C-Square was there
with his entourage.

09:18.190 --> 09:20.681
And what? He hit on Julia
in the restaurant?

09:20.760 --> 09:22.751
(Patti)
It wasrt obnoxious
or anything.

09:22.828 --> 09:26.924
We were at a table for four
and he kind of
invited himself to join us.

09:26.999 --> 09:29.433
I hate to admit it,
but it was kind of a kick.

09:29.502 --> 09:32.027
You know,
the whole restaurant
staring at us.

09:33.172 --> 09:36.733
Julia mentioned
something about tickets.
They were for her brother.

09:36.842 --> 09:38.400
He's into heavy metal.

09:38.477 --> 09:42.311
So she was expecting
C-Square to drop by
with two in the front row?

09:42.448 --> 09:44.439
No. He said
he'd send them over.

09:45.017 --> 09:47.986
We were in our room studying,
around midnight...

09:48.054 --> 09:50.181
and C shows up,
looking for Julia.

09:50.256 --> 09:54.022
He said that the tickets
were down in the car.
Julia went down with him.

09:54.093 --> 09:57.187
And a couple of minutes
later, she called us
from his car phone...

09:57.263 --> 09:59.197
said they were
going out dancing.

09:59.265 --> 10:02.098
Julia usually go out dancing
after midnight?

10:02.468 --> 10:03.958
He's C-Square.

10:04.904 --> 10:06.895
(Briscoe)
The people in
the room next to his...

10:06.973 --> 10:08.406
were either
very sound sleepers...

10:08.474 --> 10:11.602
or Julia isn't a screamer,
'cause nobody heard anything.

10:11.978 --> 10:15.141
French silk. Button torn off.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.510
Sounds like
he was a little eager.

10:17.583 --> 10:21.610
You know,
I'm trying awfully hard
to be politically correct...

10:21.787 --> 10:27.157
but I've been eager myself.
It's no crime.
If you don't take no
for an answer, it is.

10:29.595 --> 10:31.893
Unless it was "no"
after the fact.

10:32.264 --> 10:35.665
If Ann-Margret had asked me
to go dancing when I was
standing at the altar...

10:35.735 --> 10:38.704
I would have turned
to the preacher and said,
"I don't."

10:38.771 --> 10:40.705
Fame makes people
do stupid things.

10:40.773 --> 10:42.968
Okay, so Julia's star-struck.

10:43.342 --> 10:45.640
Why does she call foul
after the fact?

10:45.711 --> 10:50.273
Money. Publicity. Guilt.
Probably in that order.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.776
You guys both single?
Three times.

10:55.154 --> 10:56.712
Hey, how about this?

10:56.789 --> 11:00.020
Julia's supposedly studying
when C-Square shows up.

11:00.359 --> 11:03.920
Now, what co-ed bones up on
calculus in a $100 blouse?

11:03.996 --> 11:06.487
Yeah. Maybe
she was expecting somebody.

11:06.565 --> 11:08.931
Do you think it's possible
that someone in the lobby...

11:09.001 --> 11:11.265
saw them on their way
up to his suite?

11:13.005 --> 11:15.633
C-Square checks in,
we put on extra security.

11:15.808 --> 11:17.867
Girls come out of the shag
in the carpet.

11:17.943 --> 11:19.501
What about this girl?

11:20.880 --> 11:22.939
Yeah, sure.
She was with him last night.

11:23.015 --> 11:26.507
They look pretty friendly?
He had his arm around her.

11:26.752 --> 11:29.186
And how accommodating
was the girl?

11:29.255 --> 11:33.248
Like a cat after
five courses of canary.
Happy she made the short list.

11:33.325 --> 11:36.294
So it's the same routine
every night, different girl.

11:36.662 --> 11:38.129
Actually,
he's had a regular.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.791
A tall blond with him
every other night this week.

11:40.866 --> 11:44.632
You got a name for the blond?
We don't keep track
of our guests' guests.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.365
Let me explain something.

11:46.439 --> 11:49.875
This girl in the picture here
had a couple of belts
in the bar.

11:50.109 --> 11:51.633
She's only 19.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.713
[Computer clicking]

11:59.452 --> 12:00.817
[Computer beeps]

12:07.093 --> 12:09.357
(desk clerk)
He could sue me for this.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.564
He called the same
four numbers every day.

12:15.034 --> 12:17.798
I got a feeling
one of them's a blond.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.969
(Sheila)
Whenever he's in town, we have
drinks, dinner. What of it?

12:26.078 --> 12:30.481
We were just wondering,
did he kiss you on the cheek
at the doorstep after dessert?

12:30.850 --> 12:32.511
What's this about?

12:32.818 --> 12:33.807
[Exhales]

12:34.153 --> 12:38.783
We found out that you spent
six of the last seven nights
at his apartment.

12:39.058 --> 12:41.822
Then I'm sure you know
exactly where it was
that he kissed me.

12:41.894 --> 12:44.522
And exactly
what of mine you can kiss.

12:45.831 --> 12:48.026
You guys don't look like Vice.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.192
Look like them?
We don't even know
their phone number.

12:53.639 --> 12:57.973
Teddy Wayne, C-Square's
manager, always puts me
together with the top people.

12:58.477 --> 13:01.071
You might call me
an entertainer's entertainer.

13:01.147 --> 13:04.742
So if he buys off the rack,
you mean, he never really
knows what he's getting.

13:04.817 --> 13:07.980
Guys in C-Square's
stratosphere,
they're sitting ducks...

13:08.053 --> 13:11.420
for people with bad intentions
and <i>l</i> or bad infections.

13:11.991 --> 13:13.515
Teddy looks out for him.

13:13.592 --> 13:17.688
I'm well compensated for
a week's work and everybody
gets a good night's sleep.

13:17.763 --> 13:21.722
Yeah, all right. You got paid
for a week, but what happened
to last night?

13:21.967 --> 13:24.492
C-Square was supposed
to pick me up at 5:00.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.834
4:45 he calls,
says he made other plans.

13:27.907 --> 13:29.465
So I did the same.

13:30.342 --> 13:33.607
Tall drink of water.
Made me break a sweat.

13:33.712 --> 13:37.307
I wonder if she takes
charge cards. Here we go.

13:41.687 --> 13:44.656
Listen,
if you had a sure thing...

13:45.324 --> 13:48.157
you gonna cancel
unless you had someone
waiting in the wings?

13:48.227 --> 13:52.163
You mean Julia?
Not my type.
I like them a little dirty.

13:52.498 --> 13:55.092
Well, maybe C-Square likes
the smell of soap.

13:56.569 --> 13:59.538
What do you say
we ask her over to our place?

14:02.208 --> 14:04.301
<i>I was trying to do something</i>
<i>nice for my brother.</i>

14:04.376 --> 14:07.470
<i>He's into heavy metal.</i>
<i>I thought if I could get him</i>
<i>tickets to the Garden...</i>

14:07.546 --> 14:09.946
<i>So you go up to</i>
<i>this guy's hotel room?</i>

14:10.015 --> 14:13.815
<i>In my grandmother's day</i>
<i>it was etchings.</i>
<i>You think I'm lying?</i>

14:14.320 --> 14:18.950
Guy's a star. Who knows?
A lot of girls
might consider you lucky.

14:19.024 --> 14:22.585
You think I would've
gone up there if I knew
what he was gonna do?

14:22.661 --> 14:25.129
So you went up there
with no expectations.

14:25.631 --> 14:28.623
He's good-looking,
he's famous, rich.

14:28.934 --> 14:32.597
You werert thinking,
"Maybe I'll see what
it's like, just this once."

14:32.671 --> 14:36.072
Why does it matter
what I thought?
He wouldn't let me leave.

14:36.242 --> 14:38.574
He grabbed me.
He stuck his tongue
down my throat.

14:38.644 --> 14:40.475
You try to push him away?

14:43.515 --> 14:45.312
Do I have to do this?

14:48.687 --> 14:52.487
He didn't commit
a Class A felony
with his tongue, Julia.

14:53.325 --> 14:57.318
You made
a serious charge here.
This is part of the drill.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.791
I went into the bathroom.

15:05.204 --> 15:07.434
When I came out he was naked.

15:08.440 --> 15:12.900
He threw me down on the bed,
pulled up my skirt,
tore my underwear off <i>...</i>

15:16.348 --> 15:19.647
You know what happens.
You're helpless.

15:21.086 --> 15:24.180
You just shut your eyes
and want it to be over.

15:33.065 --> 15:36.626
Julia,
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.
You need anything?

15:44.410 --> 15:46.002
Okay, give her a lift home.

15:46.078 --> 15:47.636
We dropping it?
No.

15:48.614 --> 15:50.946
What? Did she slip you
a note in code?

15:51.016 --> 15:54.850
"Shut your eyes
and want it to be over"?
That girl was raped.

16:01.860 --> 16:05.887
We're giving her facts.
She's giving us
feminine intuition.

16:06.765 --> 16:10.098
At this rate,
the precinct's budget's gonna
go swirling down the toilet.

16:10.169 --> 16:12.330
Since when are you
so fiscally responsible?

16:12.404 --> 16:15.601
Come on,
a detective with brains
wouldn't pull this crap.

16:15.708 --> 16:18.404
Maybe the lady lieutenant's
got a take on this
that we don't have.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.378
I mean, what the hell
do we know about what goes on
in a girl's mind...

16:21.447 --> 16:22.744
when some guy's groping her?

16:22.815 --> 16:25.443
You're forgetting,
his other girlfriend said
he was a pussycat.

16:25.517 --> 16:29.248
Yeah,
but she's on the payroll.
We need somebody who isn't.

16:30.689 --> 16:32.850
How about a Mrs. C-Square?

16:33.892 --> 16:36.861
I hate to think of the stories
my exes would tell.

16:39.965 --> 16:41.557
(Sharon)
Remember <i>Different Colors?</i>

16:41.633 --> 16:43.328
Clarence wrote that one
for me.

16:43.402 --> 16:45.700
(Logan)
I guess
those were better times.

16:45.804 --> 16:49.171
What changes?
That boy still likes
his reruns, though.

16:49.441 --> 16:51.909
He comes into town
and it's the same old story.

16:51.977 --> 16:54.002
"Sharon, won't you please
come home."

16:54.079 --> 16:58.778
And what? You turn him down?
Well, that depends.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.386
I mean, I've been going
with this guy since I was 17.

17:02.454 --> 17:05.548
Married him two years later.
Got so, I don't know,
I kind of like it.

17:05.624 --> 17:09.526
So what happened?
You got tired of life
on the cover of <i>Rolling Stone?</i>

17:10.329 --> 17:13.263
Clarence has got
one large sexual appetite.

17:13.499 --> 17:15.398
Any reruns this trip?

17:18.037 --> 17:21.404
Andy, sweetie,
why don't you go inside
for a little bit. Okay?

17:25.778 --> 17:30.511
Two nights ago, he comes over,
and he lays it on thick,
like molasses.

17:30.582 --> 17:32.709
Dinner, flowers,
you name it.

17:33.619 --> 17:38.352
Andy gets me up at 6:00.
It's after midnight.
Maid's on vacation.

17:38.590 --> 17:40.524
How's Clarence take rejection?

17:42.127 --> 17:46.029
About the way Andy takes it
when I tell her
she can't have her rocky road.

17:46.098 --> 17:49.534
Problem for Clarence,
I scream a lot louder
than Andy.

17:50.502 --> 17:53.767
Well, it looks like
C-Square's sure thing
wasrt Julia.

17:53.839 --> 17:58.606
Yeah. He's in heat, his ex
turns him down, he's already
canceled his other date.

17:58.677 --> 18:01.805
Oh, well,
that scenario happens to me
a couple of times a week.

18:01.880 --> 18:02.972
[Chuckles]

18:03.549 --> 18:07.645
So it's too late
to pick up the local virgin
down at the soda shop.

18:07.719 --> 18:09.846
He remembers Julia,
finds her address <i>...</i>

18:09.922 --> 18:12.413
And he and his hormones
head downtown in the limo?

18:12.491 --> 18:16.689
Yeah, but Julia said
C-Square was gonna
give her money for a cab.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.864
Why do you take a cab
when you've got a limo?

18:20.966 --> 18:25.198
I'm on 24 per.
Some nights I sit downstairs,
read the paper.

18:25.804 --> 18:27.066
How about last night?

18:27.139 --> 18:30.802
All right, so maybe
I caught a couple of z's.
That against the law?

18:30.876 --> 18:33.811
How do you know C-Square
wasrt looking for you?

18:33.879 --> 18:36.609
Between me, you,
and the coffee pot,
all right?

18:36.849 --> 18:40.012
My mars in for the night.
So I figure, what the hell,
I'm not tired.

18:40.085 --> 18:43.782
Plenty of time
to pick up some fares.
That's a no-no around here.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.882
How did you know
he was in for the night?
He told me.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.886
Said to come by
around noon for breakfast.

18:50.529 --> 18:51.723
Thanks.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.955
He told us he wanted
to go dancing.

18:54.032 --> 18:57.331
If you send your limo home,
you ain't going dancing.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.805
Do I have to tell you
100 times?

19:00.873 --> 19:03.967
We went up to my room,
the girl jumped me. Okay?

19:04.109 --> 19:06.339
All right. Tell me this.

19:07.045 --> 19:08.512
If Julia jumped you...

19:08.580 --> 19:11.981
how come she was
wearing all her clothes
and you were buck naked?

19:12.050 --> 19:14.075
Hey, whatever floats
her boat.

19:14.720 --> 19:17.553
You know, I don't think
that's very funny.

19:18.190 --> 19:21.785
I got a strong feeling
that the only way you get any
is to take it.

19:22.127 --> 19:23.754
You better be careful, man.

19:23.829 --> 19:27.390
You go too long,
juices back up,
it makes you bonzo.

19:27.799 --> 19:31.599
Well, tell me this, Clarence,
where were you planning
on going dancing?

19:31.670 --> 19:33.831
The girl said she wanted
to go to The Palladium.

19:33.906 --> 19:36.374
Well, what magic carpet
was gonna fly you there?

19:36.441 --> 19:38.068
See,
that club's way downtown...

19:38.143 --> 19:40.839
and we know you told your
limo driver to pack it in.

19:40.913 --> 19:43.780
You want 100 names? 1,000?

19:44.449 --> 19:48.579
Look, if this Julia chick
doesn't want it, I pick up
the phone and presto.

19:48.654 --> 19:53.284
I don't spend a night
by myself, okay? And there's
no way I have to rape anyone.

19:53.692 --> 19:57.184
Well, unless she was a nice,
squeaky-clean, preppy girl.

19:57.262 --> 20:00.959
And there was Julia,
right in your bedroom.
That's right.

20:01.433 --> 20:05.199
Tight young bod,
pleated skirt. Hey,
should have been there, man.

20:05.270 --> 20:06.601
What's the problem?

20:06.672 --> 20:09.300
The problem is,
she told you
to hit the brakes.

20:09.474 --> 20:13.433
You still don't get it,
do you, man? I'm C-Square.

20:13.745 --> 20:15.576
dd <i>[guitar humming]</i>

20:16.114 --> 20:19.413
This piece of cheese thinks
the world owes him something.

20:19.484 --> 20:21.315
(Briscoe)
Yeah, a lot of women
would agree.

20:21.386 --> 20:24.685
I mean,
he says his black book's
into quadruple digits.

20:24.756 --> 20:26.883
If any of these women
told him to stop...

20:26.959 --> 20:29.120
do you think
he's the kind of guy
who'd listen?

20:29.194 --> 20:32.061
I think he's been standing
too close to his speakers
for too long.

20:32.130 --> 20:34.792
These rock 'r rollers
are a traveling menagerie.

20:34.866 --> 20:36.629
You try talking
to any of them?

20:36.702 --> 20:39.899
Hey,
you're on the gravy train,
you don't shoot the conductor.

20:39.972 --> 20:43.499
What's the manager's name?
Teddy Wayne.

20:44.042 --> 20:48.945
He said he took over
C-Square's career
two years ago. Right?

20:49.815 --> 20:52.613
The guy's been
on the charts for what,
five years?

20:52.684 --> 20:56.552
Maybe the guy who had
the privilege of managing
C-Square before Wayne...

20:56.622 --> 20:58.852
might feel like he got raped.

21:02.094 --> 21:03.891
(Feinberg)
Ungrateful bastard.

21:03.962 --> 21:06.988
He'd still be bussing tables
here if it wasrt for me.

21:07.099 --> 21:10.227
A lot of guys forget
the people they met
on the way up the ladder.

21:10.302 --> 21:12.566
I'm not talking
about birthday cards,
Detective.

21:12.638 --> 21:14.037
I got him
his first record deal.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.904
I had him signed
to a 10-year contract
to manage him.

21:16.975 --> 21:19.341
And what happened?
Teddy Wayne's what happened.

21:19.411 --> 21:21.971
Tells Clarence
I'm screwing up his career.

21:22.047 --> 21:25.039
10% of $100 million
should be in my
money market...

21:25.117 --> 21:27.677
and for that
I'd have looked out for him.

21:28.086 --> 21:32.489
You think this girl's
on the up-and-up?
We're looking
for confirmation.

21:34.860 --> 21:38.023
It was about six months
after Clarence left me,
he comes in here.

21:38.096 --> 21:40.690
He's in trouble, see,
so he comes back to me.

21:40.766 --> 21:44.930
Some girl in Passaic
accused him of some
very nasty things.

21:45.070 --> 21:48.301
He's scared.
He sees the whole thing
slipping away.

21:48.473 --> 21:52.534
I remember her name.
McCan'tney. No relation.

21:55.447 --> 21:58.177
Got to the stadium
at 4:00 a.m. On a Monday...

21:58.250 --> 22:01.083
slept on the sidewalk
till Wednesday to get tickets.

22:02.087 --> 22:05.523
I was 18. I was crazy.
I hope you got good seats.

22:06.291 --> 22:07.758
Eighth row.

22:08.627 --> 22:11.619
Right after the first break,
one of the roadies
slips me a note.

22:11.697 --> 22:14.757
C-Square wants
to buy me dinner
after the show.

22:14.900 --> 22:17.494
That's an offer
you couldn't refuse, right?

22:17.569 --> 22:21.266
Refuse?
50,000 people, he chose me?

22:22.941 --> 22:24.374
I was in heaven.

22:24.509 --> 22:28.605
Let me guess, C-Square
had a nice, full refrigerator
back at his hotel suite.

22:29.815 --> 22:32.807
We ordered pizzas.
(Logan)
Just the two of you?

22:34.553 --> 22:37.852
I thought we were gonna eat.
He was all over me.

22:37.956 --> 22:41.187
He got rough.
I kept saying,
"Hey, stop. I don't want to."

22:41.927 --> 22:43.758
It didn't make a difference.

22:43.829 --> 22:47.492
That's called rape, Tina.
I talked to the D.A.

22:47.966 --> 22:50.696
He said I could prosecute
if I wanted to but <i>...</i>

22:52.170 --> 22:54.400
You know.
No, no, we don't know.

22:54.639 --> 22:58.370
Did you take
the D.A.'s advice?
Maybe I did lead him on.

23:01.012 --> 23:04.573
Anyway, I got the money.
Money, how?

23:05.183 --> 23:07.743
C-Square's manager
gave me $10,000.

23:08.954 --> 23:11.889
Said he was sorry
for the misunderstanding.

23:13.792 --> 23:17.922
There's at least
one other victim out there.
It happened the same way
as with Julia.

23:17.996 --> 23:21.227
Girl goes up to his room
willingly and he's only got
one thing on his mind.

23:21.299 --> 23:24.234
It shows predisposition.
Which isn't admissible
in court.

23:24.302 --> 23:26.770
Well, how many rapists
you know are gonna
rent out Shea Stadium?

23:26.838 --> 23:28.237
We're not gonna find
any witnesses.

23:28.306 --> 23:32.037
It's not so much
that I believe her
as I don't believe him.

23:32.511 --> 23:36.140
Call it my male intuition.
Pick him up.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.949
[Crowd screaming]

23:48.860 --> 23:50.919
[Cameras clicking]

23:58.003 --> 24:01.404
Clarence Carmichael.
Okay, you got me.
I shot the sheriff.

24:01.540 --> 24:03.735
But the deputy, I swear,
that was some other dude.

24:03.809 --> 24:05.174
I just love
rock 'r roll.

24:05.243 --> 24:08.110
Clarence Carmichael,
you're under arrest
for the rape of Julia Wood.

24:08.180 --> 24:09.670
You have the right
to remain silent.

24:09.748 --> 24:11.079
You have the right
to kiss my ass...

24:11.149 --> 24:13.674
Just keep quiet, Clarence.
This is harassment.
False arrest.

24:13.752 --> 24:14.810
You'll hear
from our lawyers.

24:14.886 --> 24:17.650
Oh, no. Not the lawyers.
I'm scared. You scared, Mike?

24:17.722 --> 24:20.816
I'm shaking
in my blue suede shoes.

24:20.892 --> 24:22.416
(C-Square)
Bye, honey.

24:22.861 --> 24:25.261
[Crowd shouting]

24:29.234 --> 24:31.828
(clerk)
"Docket number 679073.

24:31.903 --> 24:36.169
"People versus Clarence
Carmichael. Charge is rape
in the first degree."

24:36.875 --> 24:39.207
Nice place
you got here, Judge.

24:41.613 --> 24:43.911
How do you plead?
[Whispers]
Not guilty.

24:44.382 --> 24:45.781
Not guilty.

24:46.084 --> 24:50.077
What do the People
have to say?
People request
bail of $250,000.

24:50.288 --> 24:52.483
Ms. Diamond?
That's fine, Your Honor.

24:52.557 --> 24:55.958
There's no business
like show business. Next.

24:56.795 --> 24:59.491
See you later.
See you later.

25:00.131 --> 25:03.328
Ms. Diamond? Claire Kincaid.

25:03.702 --> 25:05.329
Yes, Ms. Kincaid.

25:05.570 --> 25:07.265
This side of the table's
a long way...

25:07.339 --> 25:09.603
from the doctrine
you presented
in your Harvard lectures.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.642
Not when your side
confuses feminism...

25:11.710 --> 25:14.679
with destroying a mars life
for money and publicity.

25:14.746 --> 25:19.012
It's time we turned in
our passivity and took more
responsibility for our lives.

25:19.084 --> 25:21.416
That's the feminism
I lecture about now.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.119
[Briefcase clicks]

25:24.789 --> 25:27.019
She's one of the top
defense lawyers in the city.

25:27.092 --> 25:30.459
A judicial conference
this early in the case
doesn't make sense.

25:30.529 --> 25:33.794
No papers. She probably
just wants to go over
the parameters of discovery.

25:33.865 --> 25:36.800
Adele Diamond?
I wish life were that simple.

25:38.970 --> 25:40.494
Recuse myself?

25:41.273 --> 25:44.299
I put on my robes,
I leave my politics behind.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.345
In five years
no one's ever even hinted
that I've been biased.

25:47.412 --> 25:51.212
This is ridiculous, Adele.
Half the people sitting on the
bench are former A.D.A.'s...

25:51.283 --> 25:53.547
and most of them
have prosecuted rapes.

25:53.618 --> 25:55.347
Is everybody through?

25:55.420 --> 25:59.618
And it isn't your politics
I object to, Your Honor.
It's your genealogy.

25:59.691 --> 26:01.556
This better be good,
Counselor.

26:01.626 --> 26:04.891
Specifically,
one Gary Bergman.
I believe he's your nephew.

26:06.998 --> 26:10.525
My husband's sister's oldest.
I haven't seen him
since his bar mitzvah.

26:10.602 --> 26:14.094
He's also a limited partner
in a restaurant in L.A.
Called The Amp.

26:14.172 --> 26:17.005
(Kincaid)
We're talking about
a rape trial 3,000 miles away.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.940
What influence
could that possibly have?

26:19.010 --> 26:22.605
If you'll let me finish,
Miss <i>...</i>
Kincaid. Claire Kincaid.

26:24.316 --> 26:26.477
The Amp has been losing money
hand over fist...

26:26.551 --> 26:29.987
and the limited partners
have filed suit against
the general partner.

26:30.055 --> 26:33.218
Let me guess.
The general partner
is your client.

26:34.125 --> 26:36.286
Clarence is scared
that you'll hold it
against him...

26:36.361 --> 26:37.623
and I can hardly say
I blame him.

26:37.696 --> 26:40.130
No, Adele, you're scared of
having a woman hear this case.

26:40.198 --> 26:41.222
Nonsense, Ben.

26:41.299 --> 26:43.199
This connection is so tenuous,
Your Honor...

26:43.268 --> 26:46.567
no bar committee
in the world could
fault you for continuing.

26:47.238 --> 26:51.732
Unfortunately,
it's the appearance of
impropriety I must deal with.

26:53.144 --> 26:56.045
Your motion is granted,
Counselor. I'm off the case.

26:56.581 --> 26:59.573
My clerk will draw up
the papers after lunch.

27:00.385 --> 27:02.910
I thought they had laws
intended to shield us.

27:02.988 --> 27:04.580
(Kincaid)
Someone tipped off
the tabloids.

27:04.656 --> 27:07.716
They prefer to publish today,
worry about the consequences
tomorrow.

27:07.792 --> 27:12.024
Mr. Stone. Mr. Wood and Julia.

27:12.897 --> 27:16.526
How do you do? Ms. Wood.
Please be seated.

27:19.604 --> 27:21.572
Julia and I have been over it.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.803
(Wood)
Backwards and forwards, and
there is only one conclusion.

27:24.876 --> 27:28.744
To pursue this matter
any further is not in
my daughter's best interest.

27:29.914 --> 27:33.077
Ms. Wood, I can't put myself
in your position.

27:33.385 --> 27:34.875
But I can sympathize.

27:34.953 --> 27:37.547
A rape trial
can be very painful.

27:38.189 --> 27:39.713
But balancing
the bad and the good...

27:39.791 --> 27:40.883
(Wood)
Good?

27:40.959 --> 27:43.826
Reporters are already camping
on my front lawn.

27:43.928 --> 27:46.522
They're going
through my garbage.
I can't live like that.

27:46.598 --> 27:50.762
Your daughter was the victim
of a Class A felony, Mr. Wood.
Not you.

27:50.935 --> 27:54.769
This will become
the central fact of her life
for much too long.

27:54.906 --> 27:56.305
(Stone)
Ms. Wood...

27:57.709 --> 28:01.509
I will do everything
in my power to protect
your privacy in the future.

28:03.181 --> 28:06.309
I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

28:10.455 --> 28:14.858
It was the father's decision,
Adam. I doubt if the daughter
was even consulted.

28:14.926 --> 28:17.918
Yeah, well, it's for the best.
You'll have a hell of a time
explaining...

28:17.996 --> 28:20.760
what that girl was doing
in his room after midnight.

28:20.832 --> 28:24.495
But does the 70-year-old
mugging victim
have to explain why...

28:24.569 --> 28:26.867
he was riding alone
on a subway at night?

28:26.938 --> 28:28.428
Well,
it'd make our job easier.

28:28.506 --> 28:31.339
Of course it would.
We wouldn't have
any more victims.

28:31.409 --> 28:34.139
I don't want regret
prosecuted as rape.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.272
She told him to stop, Adam.

28:37.348 --> 28:39.646
Yeah. I tell my grandson:

28:40.752 --> 28:43.186
"Your mother doesn't
want you eating any candy."

28:43.254 --> 28:46.985
And then I leave him
alone in a room
with a jar full of M&Ms.

28:47.358 --> 28:51.795
Julia Wood
is not a piece of candy, Adam.
To Clarence Carmichael she is.

28:51.863 --> 28:54.491
[Knocking on door]
And that's why
we should pursue it.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.033
Yes, come in.

28:59.304 --> 29:01.169
You'd better read this.

29:06.845 --> 29:11.612
"Julia Wood, the co-ed
claiming to have been raped
by rocker C-Square...

29:11.683 --> 29:14.413
"reportedly told her roommates
earlier that day...

29:14.486 --> 29:17.250
"that it was a crime
how much money
the singer earned...

29:17.322 --> 29:21.418
"and that his ex-wife deserved
all the millions she received
in the divorce."

29:23.294 --> 29:25.319
(Schiff)
Well, that's just great.

29:27.332 --> 29:29.323
We can forget about a deal.

29:29.400 --> 29:32.426
Between her father
and the media, no wonder
she's running for cover.

29:32.504 --> 29:35.439
All I want to know is
was she, in fact, raped?

29:35.540 --> 29:38.737
And if she was?
Well, I'll get her into court.

29:38.943 --> 29:42.242
I think you might scare her.
You're probably right.

29:43.381 --> 29:45.008
You talk to her.

29:47.752 --> 29:50.619
I just want to be left alone.
Why can't anyone
understand that?

29:50.688 --> 29:52.485
You mean, you never thought
about his money?

29:52.557 --> 29:55.390
My father dragged me
to a lawyer's office.

29:56.594 --> 30:00.360
You hired an attorney?
I talked to him.
I never hired him.

30:01.499 --> 30:02.796
I was raped.

30:02.867 --> 30:05.893
Do you actually think
that any amount of money
will make that go away?

30:05.970 --> 30:08.438
You must have read
what your roommate
told the newspapers.

30:08.506 --> 30:11.498
You know the impression
that gives.
Of course I read it.

30:11.576 --> 30:15.740
That reporter
put words in her mouth.
It made me feel like a whore.

30:18.016 --> 30:20.849
You can't tell me
you've never been there.

30:21.019 --> 30:25.353
Some guy
has his hand in your <i>...</i>
And he won't stop.

30:29.260 --> 30:30.818
What's the use?

30:31.095 --> 30:34.189
You don't even believe me.
I do believe you.

30:35.366 --> 30:37.129
That's the problem.

30:38.169 --> 30:41.400
You know, Julia,
if you don't pursue this,
he wins.

30:41.606 --> 30:44.131
And you'll always
feel like a whore.

30:52.383 --> 30:55.978
I examined Ms. Wood
within two hours
of the alleged rape.

30:56.120 --> 30:58.520
What were the results
of your examination?

30:58.590 --> 31:02.458
I found semen.
There were hematomas on her
upper arms and shoulders.

31:02.527 --> 31:03.926
Vaginal bruising.

31:03.995 --> 31:07.362
And based on this examination,
what conclusion did you reach?

31:08.166 --> 31:10.634
(Wells)
The physical evidence and
her psychological demeanor...

31:10.702 --> 31:14.399
during the several hours
following her admission
are consistent with rape.

31:14.472 --> 31:15.837
Thank you.

31:17.508 --> 31:20.443
"Her psychological
demeanor." I see.

31:20.612 --> 31:23.410
The patient
was in shock, was she?
No.

31:23.748 --> 31:26.308
She was screaming
hysterically?
No.

31:27.585 --> 31:29.314
I don't understand, Doctor.

31:29.387 --> 31:32.185
What psychological demeanor
are you referring to?

31:33.258 --> 31:36.193
She was depressed,
listless, uncommunicative.

31:38.263 --> 31:42.199
Let's put Ms. Wood's
psychological demeanor
aside for a moment.

31:42.333 --> 31:44.927
Judging from the physical
evidence alone...

31:45.069 --> 31:49.062
could you say beyond
any reasonable doubt
that she was raped...

31:49.173 --> 31:53.109
as opposed to engaging
in enthusiastic intercourse?

31:55.380 --> 31:56.438
No.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.950
As soon as
we got to his suite,
his whole attitude changed.

32:02.053 --> 32:05.716
Julia, could you speak
a little louder, please?

32:08.259 --> 32:11.387
He became,
I don't know, crude.

32:12.063 --> 32:14.122
Like I was just there
to be used.

32:14.766 --> 32:16.393
It turned me off.

32:17.402 --> 32:18.960
So what did you do?

32:20.805 --> 32:23.501
I said it was late
and I was going home...

32:23.975 --> 32:27.240
but he grabbed me and said
I wasrt going anywhere.

32:28.479 --> 32:32.575
He started groping
at my blouse.
He ripped a button.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.108
I asked him to stop.

32:35.653 --> 32:37.314
And did he listen?

32:38.923 --> 32:40.288
He laughed.

32:41.359 --> 32:45.955
I pulled away and went
into the bathroom and locked
the door. I was shaking.

32:50.401 --> 32:54.531
I don't know,
maybe 10 minutes later,
it was quiet.

32:55.006 --> 32:57.839
So I thought maybe
he'd left or passed out.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.576
(Stone)
So you came out
into the bedroom?

33:05.416 --> 33:06.883
He was naked.

33:08.519 --> 33:11.454
He was mad because
I still had my clothes on.

33:12.123 --> 33:13.454
He threw me down on the bed.

33:13.524 --> 33:16.789
Did you say anything
when he did that?
I said, "No."

33:23.001 --> 33:24.662
Continue, please.

33:28.606 --> 33:32.042
He forced my legs open.
He was so strong.

33:35.246 --> 33:37.111
Then he was inside me.

33:43.254 --> 33:44.881
Thank you, Julia.

33:47.725 --> 33:52.458
When he grabbed you and tried
to unbutton your blouse,
did you scream?

33:53.197 --> 33:54.289
No.

33:54.365 --> 33:58.267
Did you call for help?
I thought he would hurt me.
I was scared.

33:58.336 --> 34:01.271
But you had enough
presence of mind
to go into the bathroom.

34:01.339 --> 34:03.466
I just wanted him
to leave me alone.

34:03.541 --> 34:05.668
(Diamond)
Tell me, Julia,
why didn't you...

34:05.743 --> 34:10.077
pick up the telephone
on the wall next to the toilet
and call for help?

34:11.081 --> 34:13.243
I didn't think. I don't know.

34:15.119 --> 34:19.647
Isn't it true, Julia, that you
got a thrill out of being
with a famous rock star?

34:20.992 --> 34:22.118
Yes.

34:22.193 --> 34:24.991
Enough to fantasize
about sleeping with him?

34:25.063 --> 34:29.500
What I thought doesn't
make a difference. I begged
him to stop and he didn't.

34:29.567 --> 34:31.091
Very dramatic, Julia.

34:31.502 --> 34:33.993
Tell me,
has anyone from the media
approached you...

34:34.072 --> 34:36.438
about selling your rights
to this story?

34:37.341 --> 34:38.967
Yes, but I won't talk to them.

34:39.043 --> 34:41.534
Have you been in touch
with any lawyers or agents...

34:41.612 --> 34:45.378
who told you how much
you might make as a result
of these allegations?

34:46.184 --> 34:47.208
No.

34:50.154 --> 34:52.088
(Diamond)
No further questions.

34:56.494 --> 34:59.156
(Stone)
She perjured herself. Lied
about talking to a lawyer.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.219
Yeah.

35:00.398 --> 35:03.094
If you were sufficiently
informed...

35:03.167 --> 35:04.759
to recognize
the girl's perjury...

35:04.836 --> 35:07.634
why werert you sufficiently
prepared to prevent it?

35:07.705 --> 35:09.332
I just found out myself.

35:09.407 --> 35:12.137
Julia told me about it
before the trial.

35:13.010 --> 35:14.739
You didn't think
you ought to tell somebody?

35:14.812 --> 35:17.781
She told me
that her father brought her
to the lawyer's office.

35:17.849 --> 35:20.010
She swore
that she didn't retain him.

35:20.084 --> 35:23.713
I didn't think it was relevant
to whether or not
she was raped. I still don't.

35:23.788 --> 35:27.246
Yeah. Did you notify Diamond?

35:29.894 --> 35:32.795
(Schiff)
She's already planning
her acquittal party.

35:33.397 --> 35:35.695
We can't afford
these mistakes.

35:37.869 --> 35:41.100
I'm very sorry.
I'm sure you are.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.138
We came forward
as soon as we learned
about the perjury.

35:44.208 --> 35:46.438
There is no
ethical violation.

35:46.944 --> 35:50.072
Don't you think
we can rationalize
Julia's lie to the jury?

35:50.148 --> 35:51.638
Ms. Kincaid...

35:52.083 --> 35:56.076
my immediate concern
is something altogether
different from that.

35:56.721 --> 36:00.555
Specifically,
being able to trust
the people that I work with.

36:01.826 --> 36:03.589
You have the right
to be angry. Okay.

36:03.661 --> 36:06.926
I made a mistake
and I'm ready to
take the heat for it.

36:07.231 --> 36:09.995
But I resent the implication
that I breached your trust.

36:10.067 --> 36:12.900
I'm not interested
in what you resent,
Ms. Kincaid.

36:14.672 --> 36:18.540
I think it would be wise
if you requested
a change of assignment...

36:18.609 --> 36:21.601
immediately after
Mr. Carmichael is acquitted.

36:23.381 --> 36:24.473
Fine.

36:33.157 --> 36:36.126
Ms. Wood,
yesterday I asked you...

36:36.194 --> 36:39.254
if you had the occasion
to speak with a lawyer...

36:39.330 --> 36:41.628
about any commercial aspects
of this case.

36:41.699 --> 36:44.031
Do you remember that?
Yes.

36:44.101 --> 36:47.593
And how did you answer
the question?
I said I didn't.

36:47.872 --> 36:51.273
I see. Was that the truth?
No.

36:51.475 --> 36:54.672
So you lied to this court,
is that correct?

36:55.613 --> 36:59.572
All I did was speak
to a lawyer. It doesn't mean
I wasrt raped.

36:59.817 --> 37:03.184
I see. And is that the story
you'd like to stick with?

37:07.592 --> 37:10.390
Maybe this will help
you decide.

37:11.662 --> 37:13.562
Do you recognize this?

37:15.266 --> 37:16.563
Ms. Wood.

37:18.502 --> 37:20.834
It's a retainer agreement
with a lawyer.

37:20.905 --> 37:23.772
(Diamond)
And whose signature
is that at the bottom?

37:23.908 --> 37:25.170
It's mine.

37:26.477 --> 37:29.446
Newspapers, television,
they wouldn't leave us alone.

37:29.680 --> 37:32.478
My father thought
we needed someone
to protect us.

37:32.650 --> 37:34.481
To deal with the reporters.

37:36.220 --> 37:39.018
Books, movies of the week...

37:39.390 --> 37:41.654
and the mother
of all jackpots...

37:41.726 --> 37:45.719
a civil suit after you
already have a conviction
in your pocket.

37:47.331 --> 37:50.391
It's better than the lottery,
isn't it, Julia?

37:51.168 --> 37:53.363
Why are you doing this to me?

37:54.005 --> 37:58.738
It's not me, Julia.
You sold yourself
for a wink and a prayer.

38:01.712 --> 38:03.543
Redirect, Mr. Stone?

38:07.251 --> 38:08.809
No, Your Honor.

38:11.088 --> 38:14.353
They're always all over me
after concerts. Backstage.

38:14.425 --> 38:17.019
I can't even
walk down the street.
She was no different.

38:17.094 --> 38:20.063
In what way
is she like the others,
Clarence?

38:20.364 --> 38:23.561
I talked to her
for maybe five minutes.
She came up to my room.

38:23.634 --> 38:26.228
When did she say
she didn't want sex?

38:26.470 --> 38:30.634
She didn't.
She didn't say anything when
I started with her blouse.

38:32.176 --> 38:36.272
Is this the shirt
she was wearing?
Yeah.

38:36.347 --> 38:38.975
And was it buttoned
clear up to the top button?

38:39.050 --> 38:41.814
No, it was only
closed up to this one,
the one that came off.

38:41.886 --> 38:43.410
The third one from the top.

38:43.487 --> 38:46.115
Look, I'm telling you,
she wanted me.

38:47.258 --> 38:51.456
I know
what happened in that room.
There's no way I raped her.

38:57.735 --> 38:59.430
Mr. C-Square...

39:01.605 --> 39:05.564
did Julia Wood
ever tell you...

39:05.676 --> 39:07.837
that she wanted
to have sex?

39:08.245 --> 39:11.078
She was definitely
putting out a scent, yeah.

39:11.415 --> 39:14.077
By coming to your room?
That's right.

39:14.385 --> 39:17.479
So that any woman
coming into your room...

39:17.555 --> 39:19.887
is implicitly
consenting to sex?

39:20.257 --> 39:23.283
They don't come for the view,
that's for sure.

39:23.361 --> 39:28.196
Look, any time of the week,
I go to a club and I come home
with any lady I want.

39:28.366 --> 39:32.598
And do you make love
to all of them?
That's what I do.

39:35.373 --> 39:39.537
Do you recognize this?
Sure, it's the words
to one of my songs.

39:39.610 --> 39:43.376
Objection, it's irrelevant.
It goes to state of mind,
Your Honor.

39:43.447 --> 39:45.915
Then it's overly
prejudicial and inflammatory.

39:45.983 --> 39:50.477
The witness has sold millions
of albums, Ms. Diamond.
How prejudicial can it be?

39:51.722 --> 39:54.350
All right,
you can proceed, Mr. Stone.

39:54.859 --> 39:58.420
I'd like
the court clerk to read
the highlighted portion.

39:59.330 --> 40:03.460
"One more time, on the kitchen
floor. Your tank's on empty
but I want more.

40:03.534 --> 40:08.130
"I get what I want,
it's a one-way trip. You
ain't my lady, you my bitch."

40:13.644 --> 40:15.544
That's all, your honor.

40:16.714 --> 40:20.616
A man and a woman,
both young, both attractive...

40:21.118 --> 40:23.609
retire to a hotel room
after midnight.

40:24.155 --> 40:28.148
Throw in the fact that the man
is a famous musician...

40:28.492 --> 40:31.120
talented and wealthy
beyond anyone's dreams.

40:31.195 --> 40:35.029
And what do you think
is going to happen
in that room?

40:35.699 --> 40:39.601
Now, Ms. Wood admitted
that she had a little bit
of sex on the brain.

40:39.670 --> 40:42.104
She went up
to Mr. Carmichael's room.

40:42.506 --> 40:46.772
She unbuttoned her blouse
and showed a bit of cleavage.

40:47.711 --> 40:49.679
What was he supposed to think?

40:49.747 --> 40:51.942
Well, exactly
what you must be thinking...

40:52.016 --> 40:54.678
that she wanted it as much,
if not more, than he did.

40:54.752 --> 40:59.121
Now, we all want
to believe a woman
when she says she said no.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.220
But how can we believe her...

41:01.292 --> 41:04.489
after she
lied intentionally...

41:04.562 --> 41:06.655
in this courtroom, under oath.

41:08.332 --> 41:11.165
She says she lied
because she was scared.

41:11.268 --> 41:14.135
But the evidence shows
that she lied...

41:14.271 --> 41:19.038
because she wanted
to take advantage of
my client's wealth and fame...

41:19.109 --> 41:21.600
and didn't want you
to know about it.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.542
Ms. Wood may have said no.

41:25.916 --> 41:29.977
Unfortunately,
she said it a day too late,
and that doesn't count.

41:32.389 --> 41:35.449
Yes. Julia Wood...

41:35.993 --> 41:40.555
willingly joined
Mr. C-Square in his limo.

41:41.799 --> 41:46.566
And, yes, she willingly
went up to his hotel room.

41:48.105 --> 41:52.132
And, yes, she even thought
of having sex with him.

41:52.676 --> 41:55.167
But to give her
the benefit of the doubt...

41:55.980 --> 41:59.848
Mr. Clarence "C-Square"
Carmichael is rich...

42:00.050 --> 42:03.019
and to some people
in this courtroom,
he's attractive.

42:04.388 --> 42:06.822
And, of course,
he's world-famous.

42:09.460 --> 42:12.952
But Julia Wood did not ask...

42:14.465 --> 42:16.365
to be thrown down on the bed.

42:16.700 --> 42:19.328
She did not ask...

42:19.403 --> 42:22.372
to have her legs pried open.

42:23.307 --> 42:25.832
She did not ask
to be pinned down...

42:27.044 --> 42:29.137
and forcibly penetrated.

42:30.614 --> 42:33.082
Julia Wood said no.

42:34.685 --> 42:38.246
And whatever expectations
she had going up
to that hotel suite...

42:38.722 --> 42:42.590
once she got there,
she changed her mind.
And that's her right.

42:43.928 --> 42:46.192
But in Mr. C-Square's world...

42:47.364 --> 42:49.525
a womars rights
are of no consequence.

42:49.600 --> 42:52.763
Sex is an entitlement
of his stardom.

42:52.836 --> 42:54.303
Julia Wood...

42:57.341 --> 42:59.741
ain't a lady.

43:00.244 --> 43:03.304
She a bitch, an amusement.

43:05.983 --> 43:07.814
To be held prisoner...

43:08.485 --> 43:12.751
and used until he decides
that he's through with her.

43:15.025 --> 43:17.619
In our country, one
of the fundamental rights...

43:17.695 --> 43:20.220
is the right of any of us
to say no.

43:20.698 --> 43:25.032
We do it in our religion.
We do it in our politics.

43:26.236 --> 43:28.101
And in our workplace.

43:29.406 --> 43:33.809
And in our world,
when a woman says no
and a man ignores her...

43:34.178 --> 43:36.544
that's rape
in the first degree.

43:49.560 --> 43:52.723
Have you reached a verdict?
(Foreman)
We have, Your Honor.

43:55.165 --> 43:57.224
(Barsky)
On the sole count
of the indictment...

43:57.301 --> 43:59.929
rape in the first degree,
how do you find?

44:00.938 --> 44:04.430
We find the defendant,
Clarence Carmichael, guilty.

44:05.576 --> 44:08.101
[People murmuring]

44:25.062 --> 44:26.120
[Beeps]

44:31.402 --> 44:34.030
I'm preparing a calendar
of pending cases.

44:34.538 --> 44:36.972
I'll forward it
to your secretary.

44:38.676 --> 44:43.204
For all the problems we had,
I do want to thank you
for a learning experience.

44:43.280 --> 44:46.113
These working relationships
they can be...

44:47.117 --> 44:49.950
very difficult.
I remember one assistant...

44:50.120 --> 44:54.284
he stapled an internal memo
to a document
that he then sent...

44:54.591 --> 44:58.391
to defendant's counsel
and that case was lost.

45:00.030 --> 45:02.931
I thought
it was a career-ender
but they <i>...</i>

45:03.367 --> 45:05.494
They gave me another chance.

45:07.905 --> 45:10.703
So, see you in the morning?

45:11.305 --> 45:17.490
