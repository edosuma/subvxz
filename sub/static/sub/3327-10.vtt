00:03.630 --> 00:05.359
(keypad beeping)

00:07.770 --> 00:09.704
*

00:37.570 --> 00:39.094
(doorbell rings)

00:39.140 --> 00:41.267
Hey, are you gonna
get that or...

00:41.300 --> 00:43.439
(TV playing quietly)

00:43.470 --> 00:45.631
Hey, Sherlock's asleep.

00:45.670 --> 00:47.774
I wasn't sure
if I should get the door.

00:49.650 --> 00:52.744
I'm Gwen-- you're
the companion, right?

00:52.780 --> 00:54.645
Yes.
(doorbell rings)

00:54.680 --> 00:57.649
Guess I should
go get dressed.

00:57.690 --> 00:59.248
(laughs)

00:59.290 --> 01:01.656
(doorbell rings)

01:07.700 --> 01:10.168
(doorbell rings)

01:10.200 --> 01:11.792
WOMAN: Sorry, I wasn't
sure if you wanted me

01:11.830 --> 01:13.138
to get...

01:13.170 --> 01:15.661
Oh, you're
not Sherlock.

01:15.700 --> 01:17.201
You're the companion, right?

01:17.240 --> 01:18.730
Yes.

01:18.770 --> 01:20.408
I'm Olivia.
It's nice to meet you.

01:20.440 --> 01:22.146
I think I just met your sister.

01:22.180 --> 01:24.148
Did she mention what time our
car servnce IS getting here?

01:24.180 --> 01:25.442
(doorbell rings)
No.

01:25.480 --> 01:26.811
You should get the door.

01:26.850 --> 01:28.875
There's crepes
downstairs if you want.

01:28.920 --> 01:32.287
Good morning.

01:32.320 --> 01:36.188
Well, if you must know, Watson,
the Lynch sisters and I enjoy

01:36.230 --> 01:37.549
a mutually beneficial
relationship.

01:37.590 --> 01:39.421
"If I must know?"
I didn't ask.

01:39.460 --> 01:41.291
I need to study the difference
between two specimens born

01:41.330 --> 01:42.888
into the world with exactly
the same genetic material.

01:42.930 --> 01:46.195
In the Lynches case,
there are seven major ones.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.491
And they get...

01:47.540 --> 01:49.838
I... didn't... ask.

01:49.870 --> 01:51.337
(doorbell rings)

01:51.370 --> 01:52.701
If that's for me,
I'm not here.

01:52.740 --> 01:53.877
I'm going back to bed,

01:55.740 --> 01:57.844
Good morning.

01:57.880 --> 01:59.916
Does, um,
Sherlock Holmes live here?

01:59.950 --> 02:01.372
I was referred here

02:01.420 --> 02:03.285
by an old colleague
of his in London.

02:03.320 --> 02:05.140
He said I might have
to try more than once.

02:05.190 --> 02:06.851
Good advice.
Would you please tell him

02:06.890 --> 02:08.812
that I need
to speak with him?

02:08.860 --> 02:10.555
Why don't you
tell him yourself.

02:15.530 --> 02:18.624
Casterly Rock Security.

02:18.670 --> 02:21.264
The world's foremost maker
of bank vaults.

02:21.300 --> 02:24.428
And you, Mr. Erlich, are the
president and head engineer.

02:24.470 --> 02:26.506
I am familiar with
your work. Crepe?

02:28.940 --> 02:32.148
Bye, Sherlock.

02:34.880 --> 02:38.316
If you know our work,
you know that

02:38.350 --> 02:40.818
we introduced a new flagship
product in 2009.

02:40.860 --> 02:43.283
The Leviathan.
Yes.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.959
The safe that you marketed
as impregnable.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.367
Did you people learn nothing
from the Titanic?

02:50.400 --> 02:52.231
Bye, Sherlock.

02:58.740 --> 03:01.573
Your company introduced a
supposedly unbreakable safe

03:01.610 --> 03:04.477
in 2009, and then paid
the price for your hubris

03:04.510 --> 03:08.674
when The Leviathan was plundered
within the calendar year.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.245
Thank you.

03:11.290 --> 03:14.214
The four men who robbed
that bank, they were brilliant.

03:14.260 --> 03:17.252
A once-in-a-lifetime assembly
of criminal talent.

03:17.290 --> 03:20.657
Now, eventually all four
were caught and convicted,

03:20.700 --> 03:22.395
but none of them talked.

03:22.430 --> 03:25.228
We did what we could to improve
the product, but the chance

03:25.270 --> 03:28.831
of another four criminals_
that bright collaborating again?

03:31.410 --> 03:36.438
The Svalbard Diamond Exchange
was robbed last night.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.449
They're missing
$40 million in stones.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.368
Stones protected
by your vault.

03:41.420 --> 03:44.947
The Leviathan has
a seven-figure price tag.

03:44.990 --> 03:47.686
If somebody finds out that
another one's been compromised

03:47.720 --> 03:50.655
and we don't know how,
we're done.

03:50.690 --> 03:54.854
Well, the police must be looking
into who robbed your vault.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.596
I take it the "how"
is where I come in?

03:57.630 --> 04:00.963
I think that there must have
been a fifth conspirator.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.400
Someone the other thieves
never told us about.

04:03.440 --> 04:05.465
Poppycock.

04:05.510 --> 04:06.875
The height of
intellectual vanity.

04:06.910 --> 04:08.571
If one group of people
can figure out

04:08.610 --> 04:09.975
how to get past your vault,

04:10.010 --> 04:11.671
so can a second...
No, you don't understand.

04:11.710 --> 04:14.349
We have six layers
of bleeding-edge security,

04:14.380 --> 04:15.916
redundancy at every step.

04:15.950 --> 04:17.440
And if a second group can,
so can a third.

04:17.490 --> 04:18.639
If you want to know the answer,

04:18.690 --> 04:19.918
just take me
to the diamond exchange.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.018
We'll talk fee
on the way,

04:21.060 --> 04:22.823
although I'm not sure I have

04:22.860 --> 04:25.749
a rate for a job that's only
gonna take an hour or two.

04:25.790 --> 04:27.894
HOLMES:
The security upstairs is

04:27.930 --> 04:29.659
rather rudimentary.

04:29.700 --> 04:31.759
I take it anything of value
is stowed in the vault,

04:31.800 --> 04:32.767
after hours.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.495
Mr. Erlich.

04:34.540 --> 04:35.859
The police said
that your consultant

04:35.900 --> 04:37.800
can't see the vault
till they're done.

04:37.840 --> 04:40.308
I'm also a consultant
with the NYPD, Mister...?

04:40.340 --> 04:42.649
Batonvert, David Batonvert.
I'm the floor manager here.

04:42.680 --> 04:44.079
I assure you I know
how to conduct myself

04:44.110 --> 04:45.646
at a crime scene, Mr. Batonvert.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.875
Your name_ means
"green stick" In French.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.478
Uh, yeah?

04:49.520 --> 04:52.751
So, you have a motion sensor

04:52.790 --> 04:55.418
embedded in the ceiling,
a light sensor on the wall.

04:55.460 --> 04:57.826
Cardboard box can take care
of the motion sensor.

04:57.860 --> 05:01.626
The light detector they would
mask with simple black tape.

05:01.660 --> 05:04.094
They made short work
of that lock.

05:04.130 --> 05:06.860
Body heat sensor in the ceiling
could be coated with hair spray,

05:06.900 --> 05:09.903
buy a little time,
which brings us to...

05:09.940 --> 05:12.477
the door itself, yes.

05:12.510 --> 05:14.774
She is beautiful, hmm.

05:14.810 --> 05:17.370
This lock is not pickable.

05:17.410 --> 05:19.048
That key is, what, a foot long?

05:19.080 --> 05:21.378
The tumblers are weighted
so they cannot be manipulated

05:21.420 --> 05:23.012
with a pick.

05:23.050 --> 05:24.642
You could, of course,

05:24.690 --> 05:27.659
put a tiny camera
on this fire extinguisher.

05:27.690 --> 05:28.782
If you knew
an excellent locksmith,

05:28.820 --> 05:30.526
you could provide
an image of the key,

05:30.560 --> 05:31.720
have it duplicated.

05:31.760 --> 05:34.524
Clever, but we
already knew that.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.859
Ten-digit access code?

05:37.900 --> 05:40.869
Yes, it's provided by
a random number generator

05:40.900 --> 05:41.935
that's hardwired
into the system.

05:41.970 --> 05:42.937
The code changes
every two minutes.

05:42.970 --> 05:44.506
Who has the code?

05:44.540 --> 05:46.679
It appears on a key file
that the owner carries.

05:46.710 --> 05:49.508
If you want to get in there,
he's got to read it to you.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.370
He's in Gstaad right now.

05:51.410 --> 05:52.946
He's had the fob on him
the whole time.

05:52.980 --> 05:54.811
You could attack
the random number generator,

05:54.850 --> 05:56.943
make it spit out a pattern,
so you could predict the code.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.379
The number generator
is working perfectly.

06:03.460 --> 06:06.520
I'm gonna need
a little time with this.

06:19.010 --> 06:21.001
(keypad beeping)

06:24.680 --> 06:26.841
What are you doing down here?

06:26.880 --> 06:28.575
Stress testing the keypad.

06:28.620 --> 06:31.111
You think there'd be some tell
in the keys themselves.

06:31.150 --> 06:32.913
No, I mean, what are you
still doing down here?

06:32.960 --> 06:34.712
You said you were gonna
be gone two hours.

06:34.760 --> 06:36.455
It's been all day.
Has it?

06:36.490 --> 06:38.128
How stubborn are you
gonna be about this?

06:38.160 --> 06:40.458
Uh, excuse me?
We're closing now.

06:40.500 --> 06:42.627
Green Stick, do you want
your diamonds back or not?

06:56.040 --> 06:58.873
(gasps)

06:58.910 --> 07:01.049
Oh, she thinks she's
a clever one, doesn't she?
Who's she?

07:01.080 --> 07:02.843
Her.
What time is it?

07:02.890 --> 07:04.482
She generates an ocean
of pure randomness,

07:04.520 --> 07:06.215
and she wants you
to just lose hope and drown

07:06.250 --> 07:09.219
in all those numbers,
but I can see the horizon line.

07:09.260 --> 07:10.488
I can tread water.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.054
Stop.

07:12.090 --> 07:14.092
It is 2:00 in the morning.

07:14.130 --> 07:15.893
You've been down here for
almost, what, 17 hours?

07:17.800 --> 07:20.030
I'm supposed to meet my mother
for brunch in the morning.

07:20.070 --> 07:22.607
Not spending the night
in a bank vault.
So, go then.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.198
I'm not gonna leave you
down here like this either.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.572
In A.A., they'd say
you're on a dry drunk.

07:26.610 --> 07:28.771
You're indulging in all
the obsessions of addiction

07:28.810 --> 07:30.846
without actually using drugs,
so are you gonna admit

07:30.880 --> 07:32.973
that you can't think your
way past that vault door

07:33.020 --> 07:35.079
or am I gonna have to
smash the fire alarm

07:35.120 --> 07:36.678
and get us both
dragged out of here?

07:36.720 --> 07:38.711
You're absolutely
right, Watson.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.786
I can sometimes disappear into
the rabbit hole of my psyche.

07:40.820 --> 07:42.014
Okay, good, then
you're ready to go.

07:42.060 --> 07:43.584
Would you mind terribly
if I just tried

07:43.630 --> 07:45.029
one more idea before we leave?
(groans)

07:45.060 --> 07:46.789
It'll only take a minute.
Fine.

07:48.560 --> 07:49.527
(glass shatters)

07:49.570 --> 07:50.764
What are you doing?!

07:50.800 --> 07:52.893
Oh, my God, put that down!

07:52.940 --> 07:54.794
Put that down!

07:57.710 --> 08:00.201
Before you say anything,

08:00.240 --> 08:03.107
I would like to remind you
that I'm holding an ax.

08:27.240 --> 08:28.969
Did you give the people
at Casterly Rock

08:29.000 --> 08:30.968
my cell phone number
as your contact info?

08:31.010 --> 08:33.103
Well, I didn't want
them to call me.

08:33.140 --> 08:35.677
Yeah, well, they're wondering
who took an ax to their vault.

08:35.710 --> 08:37.575
Apparently the repair bill's
gonna be huge.

08:37.610 --> 08:38.975
Cost of doing business.

08:39.010 --> 08:40.841
They'll get over it
when I figure this out.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.711
We need to figure out

08:42.750 --> 08:45.218
who broke into the safe;
that's the way that we'll learn

08:45.250 --> 08:46.979
how it happened.

08:47.020 --> 08:48.715
It wasn't an inside job.

08:48.760 --> 08:50.284
Everyone at Casterly
Rock who knew

08:50.330 --> 08:52.719
how to get into that
thing has given an alibi.

08:52.760 --> 08:54.728
And I can't see how
the original thieves

08:54.760 --> 08:56.091
would've needed
a fifth conspirator.

08:56.130 --> 08:58.690
The four of them had
all the tools they needed

08:58.730 --> 08:59.867
between them.

08:59.900 --> 09:02.698
No, obvious what happened.

09:02.740 --> 09:05.106
One of the original team
sold the recipe

09:05.140 --> 09:08.598
for breaching The Leviathan
to an outside party.

09:08.640 --> 09:10.676
That's obvious?

09:10.710 --> 09:13.019
When you've eliminated the
impossible, whatever remains,

09:13.050 --> 09:15.712
however improbable,
is the truth.

09:15.750 --> 09:17.911
And what's impossible here
is that you couldn't break

09:17.950 --> 09:20.089
into the safe, but
someone else could.

09:20.120 --> 09:23.829
In other worlds, you are the
smartest man in the world.

09:25.830 --> 09:28.151
Waiting for you to chime in
and say that's ridiculous.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.998
You'd think it would be
easy to get one of the four

09:31.030 --> 09:33.828
original team to admit that
they sold the secret on.

09:33.870 --> 09:35.599
But Carter Averill,

09:35.640 --> 09:37.631
the man who organized the heist
died in prison last year,

09:37.670 --> 09:40.878
and the other three have yet
to respond to my request

09:40.910 --> 09:42.309
for a visit.

09:42.340 --> 09:44.945
(phone ringing)

09:44.980 --> 09:47.210
You should answer that.

09:47.250 --> 09:49.047
Tell them it was
a necessary part of my process.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.980
What are my keys doing here?

09:51.020 --> 09:52.180
They weigh
the right amount.

09:52.220 --> 09:53.949
And enjoy brunch
with your mother.

09:53.990 --> 09:55.981
I hadn't realized
you were still so eager

09:56.020 --> 09:57.726
to impress her.

09:57.760 --> 09:59.625
You're dressed like _
you're gomg to a job InterVIew,

09:59.660 --> 10:01.651
not brunch with
a loved one.

10:08.100 --> 10:10.762
(speaking Mandarin)

10:10.810 --> 10:13.631
Okay, I was still
reading that.

10:13.680 --> 10:15.238
I told them to bring us
whatever's freshest.

10:15.280 --> 10:18.078
So, I'm in the cab

10:18.110 --> 10:20.317
on the way over,
and guess who I hear from.

10:20.350 --> 10:22.045
(phone ringing)

10:24.420 --> 10:25.785
Do you have to take that?

10:25.820 --> 10:27.185
No. Go on.

10:28.390 --> 10:29.982
Your brother called.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.123
He called me; do you know
how rare that is?

10:32.160 --> 10:35.357
I haven't spoken to Oren
in, what, two months?

10:35.400 --> 10:37.061
He's coming to the city.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.965
And he's
bringing Gabrielle.

10:39.000 --> 10:40.365
Wow.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.960
He tried to cut his trip short
in order to come back

10:43.010 --> 10:45.160
for dinner with us tomorrow
night, but It dIdn't work out.

10:45.210 --> 10:46.268
Wait, tomorrow night?

10:46.310 --> 10:47.800
Mm-hmm.

10:47.840 --> 10:49.171
Mom, you know about
my job, right?

10:49.210 --> 10:50.871
I mean, I can't just
leave my client alone.

10:50.910 --> 10:53.014
This is your brother, Joan.

10:53.050 --> 10:54.244
Can't your client just get

10:54.280 --> 10:55.747
a different babysitter
for tomorrow night?

10:55.780 --> 10:58.248
"Babysitter."
Okay, here we go.

10:58.290 --> 10:59.245
(phone ringing)

10:59.290 --> 11:00.814
I didn't mean it that way.

11:00.860 --> 11:03.226
You know, I'm just
gonna get that,

11:03.260 --> 11:05.319
_because it's
just gonna...
Mm.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.827
Hey, everything okay?

11:06.860 --> 11:08.054
HOLMES:
Excellent, actually.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.863
Don't come back
to the brownstone.

11:09.900 --> 11:11.868
Meet me at Sing Sing Prison
at 2:30.

11:11.900 --> 11:14.095
Why do you want me to meet you
at Sing Sing?

11:14.140 --> 11:15.698
Charles Briggs, the lock-pick

11:15.740 --> 11:17.002
from the original team
of thieves--

11:17.040 --> 11:18.860
he's agreed to sit down with us.

11:18.910 --> 11:20.207
Okay.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.105
Okay, I'll see you there.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.700
Sing Sing, the prison?

11:24.750 --> 11:26.968
(door buzzes)
BRIGGS:
You said you want to know

11:27.020 --> 11:28.874
how we got
into Leviathan.

11:28.920 --> 11:31.286
And you think
for some reason,

11:31.320 --> 11:34.756
even though I kept my mouth shut
during the trial,

11:34.790 --> 11:37.020
I'm going to tell you.

11:37.060 --> 11:39.028
You did agree to see me,

11:39.060 --> 11:40.948
which implies
you have a price.

11:41.000 --> 11:43.264
You're one of the
best lock-pickers

11:43.300 --> 11:45.165
in the world,

11:45.200 --> 11:48.294
and I collect_
expertise, Mr. Briggs,

11:48.340 --> 11:50.763
people to help me with
my consultancy work

11:50.810 --> 11:52.402
on an as-needed basis.

11:52.440 --> 11:57.173
I think I could find a use
for a mind as lively as yours.

11:57.210 --> 11:58.871
You want me to work
for the cops?

11:58.910 --> 12:01.174
I want to offer you a
chance to use your brain.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.983
I suspect

12:03.020 --> 12:04.817
it'll be the only
such offer you get

12:04.850 --> 12:06.340
for the rest of
your natural life.

12:09.960 --> 12:12.451
How did you get past
The Leviathan door,

12:12.490 --> 12:14.754
and who did you
sell your secret to?

12:16.560 --> 12:20.337
I don't know exactly
how we got in.

12:20.370 --> 12:22.338
We were specialized.

12:22.370 --> 12:25.100
I was responsible for getting
past the outer door.

12:25.140 --> 12:27.074
Averill figured out the code,

12:27.110 --> 12:29.328
but never told the rest of us
how he did it.

12:29.380 --> 12:32.247
After he got sick, he told me
someone got in touch with him.

12:32.280 --> 12:34.817
Averill said this guy wanted
to know how he did it,

12:34.850 --> 12:36.078
and he was willing to pay.

12:36.120 --> 12:38.884
If you're saying
that somebody else

12:38.920 --> 12:40.410
broke into one
of those vaults,

12:40.460 --> 12:42.485
my guess is Carter saw
an opportunity

12:42.520 --> 12:45.159
to get a little money
for his family before he died,

12:45.190 --> 12:46.953
told the guy his secret.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.228
Who was it?

12:48.260 --> 12:49.921
I only know an alias.

12:53.000 --> 12:57.300
Even if you never find this guy,
which you won't...

12:58.610 --> 13:00.430
...is that enough
to land me this gig?

13:03.350 --> 13:06.103
The guy who Averill said
got in touch with him,

13:06.150 --> 13:09.119
everyone just calls him...

13:09.150 --> 13:11.584
Le Chevalier.

13:11.620 --> 13:13.417
WATSON:
So let me get this straight.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.859
This Le Chevalierguy,
he's a thief

13:14.890 --> 13:16.312
who's allegedly stolen

13:16.360 --> 13:18.248
an original copy
of Shakespeare's first folio,

13:18.290 --> 13:20.019
_a collection _
of anCIent Greek coms...

13:21.930 --> 13:24.262
And no one can give us
a description of him?

13:24.300 --> 13:28.066
No one knows if he's European,
American, a leprechaun.

13:28.100 --> 13:29.533
You're making a point
of some kind.

13:29.570 --> 13:31.128
Sounds like a fairy tale.

13:31.170 --> 13:32.899
Well, some
people think so.

13:32.940 --> 13:34.498
But all five robberies
attributed to Le Chevalier

13:34.540 --> 13:36.098
remain unsolved.

13:36.140 --> 13:38.005
And you asked Charles Briggs
for the name of the man

13:38.050 --> 13:39.915
who bought the secret,
and he gives you a legend,

13:39.950 --> 13:41.349
a man who might not
even exist.

13:41.380 --> 13:42.938
You know,
this is a snipe hunt.

13:42.990 --> 13:44.309
Briggs said it himself.

13:44.350 --> 13:46.318
No one's ever even _come close
to finding him.

13:46.350 --> 13:47.851
You're forgetting
one thing, Watson.

13:47.890 --> 13:49.482
I've never gone
looking for him.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.953
WATSON:
This painting was stolen

13:50.990 --> 13:53.026
the same night
that the Aster Museum

13:53.060 --> 13:54.391
finally unveiled
it to the public.

13:54.430 --> 13:56.022
Now, most people think
it was Le Chevalier.

13:56.060 --> 13:58.062
If he's real,
this guy's got style.

13:58.100 --> 13:59.419
This man is real.

13:59.470 --> 14:01.233
There is a singular sensibility
at work here.

14:01.270 --> 14:02.532
You can't just...

14:02.570 --> 14:04.162
sell these things
on the black market.

14:04.210 --> 14:05.905
They're too unique for that.

14:10.310 --> 14:13.473
Hmm.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.578
Who's that?

14:14.620 --> 14:17.043
HOLMES:
That is Peter Kent.

14:17.090 --> 14:20.150
He is head
of the Kent Philanthropic Trust

14:20.190 --> 14:21.919
andleader
of the fundraising drive

14:21.960 --> 14:25.282
that led to the acquisition
of The Piet.

14:25.330 --> 14:27.992
Look at his cufflinks.

14:31.470 --> 14:33.461
They're fashioned from
silver tetradrachms.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.058
They're Greek coins.

14:35.100 --> 14:39.434
Now... look at the coins

14:39.470 --> 14:42.633
Le Chevalierstole.

14:42.680 --> 14:44.898
WATSON:
They're the same.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.941
HOLMES:
That's Le Chevalier.

14:46.980 --> 14:50.609
Le Chevalier may be
the stuff of legend,

14:50.650 --> 14:52.618
but Peter Kent

14:52.650 --> 14:56.017
is listed in the phone book.

14:59.430 --> 15:01.398
WOMAN:
I'm sorry.

15:01.430 --> 15:02.624
I'm a little confused.

15:02.660 --> 15:04.594
You're here to speak
with Peter Kent?

15:04.630 --> 15:07.098
Yeah, tell him it's
about Greek tetradrachms.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.596
He'll know what I mean.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.538
Is that a real Hopper?

15:16.580 --> 15:19.071
Yeah, they're
all original.

15:19.110 --> 15:21.544
You could buy an island
with the art on these walls.

15:21.580 --> 15:23.684
Except that.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.483
That's a lithograph,

15:25.520 --> 15:28.284
worth maybe $40.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.321
He wouldn't be so brazen.

15:46.610 --> 15:48.999
What are you doing?!

16:10.670 --> 16:13.594
I give you
Van Gogh's Piet.

16:14.740 --> 16:16.389
We found Le Chevalier.

16:16.440 --> 16:20.035
What in God's name
are you doing?

16:20.080 --> 16:21.035
You're not Peter Kent.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.002
No, he's my father.

16:23.050 --> 16:25.268
He's also a thief,
as you can see.

16:25.310 --> 16:28.245
He stole The Piet,
and two nights ago,

16:28.280 --> 16:30.316
he robbed the Svalbard
Diamond Exchange.

16:30.350 --> 16:31.544
Two nights ago?

16:31.590 --> 16:34.184
I know this may come
as a bit of a shock,

16:34.220 --> 16:36.279
but I assure you,

16:36.320 --> 16:37.685
that painting
is genuine.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.686
I don't know anything
about that,

16:39.730 --> 16:41.197
but I'm positive
my father didn't

16:41.230 --> 16:43.027
steal anything two nights ago.

16:43.070 --> 16:46.597
My father had a
stroke two years ago.

16:46.630 --> 16:50.259
He hasn't spoken or stood

16:50.310 --> 16:52.369
in more than 18 months.

16:54.610 --> 16:56.407
You were right.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.499
Charles Briggs sent
us on a snipe hunt.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.411
HOLMES:
Tell you what, I won't
be using Charles Briggs

17:05.450 --> 17:07.213
as a consultant
anytime soon.

17:07.260 --> 17:10.127
I can't believe I got on
the subway with a Chopard watch.

17:10.160 --> 17:13.527
There are 200 carats
of diamonds on that thing.

17:13.560 --> 17:15.755
I don't even want to know
how much it costs.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.768
The watch is
$25 million.

17:17.800 --> 17:19.768
The Pie almost
twice that,

17:19.800 --> 17:22.098
if recen_t auctions
are anything to go by.

17:22.140 --> 17:24.233
Got away with
it, didn't we?

17:24.270 --> 17:27.535
Neither one of us_wa_nted_ to
put a stroke Victim In jail,

17:27.580 --> 17:30.140
and Peter Kent's son doesn't
really want the world

17:30.180 --> 17:32.171
to know what his
father did for a hobby.

17:32.210 --> 17:34.110
Yeah, it's the best
solution for all parties.

17:34.150 --> 17:35.845
I'd like to hear you
explain that in court.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.519
"Your Honor, it's true.
We abetted in grand larceny."

17:38.550 --> 17:40.154
Court, yes.

17:40.190 --> 17:41.384
Well done, Watson.

17:41.420 --> 17:43.251
What?
There was a trial.

17:43.290 --> 17:45.520
When the first heist team
was arrested,

17:45.560 --> 17:47.289
three of them
took plea bargains.

17:47.330 --> 17:49.195
But Carter Averill,
the organizer,

17:49.230 --> 17:50.663
he tried his luck at trial.

17:50.700 --> 17:52.793
All the details
of the original crime,

17:52.830 --> 17:55.139
they were aired in court,
and no one knew exactly

17:55.170 --> 17:57.138
how the foursome got
into The Leviathan,

17:57.170 --> 17:58.535
but it's worth going
over the transcripts.

17:58.570 --> 17:59.662
There would have been
expert Witnesses,

17:59.710 --> 18:01.337
summaries of fact,

18:01.380 --> 18:02.699
_ someone could have_
pieced together the solution.

18:02.740 --> 18:05.277
What? Why are you looking
at me like that?

18:05.310 --> 18:07.119
Because I think the only reason
you're clinging

18:07.150 --> 18:08.412
to this copycat theory

18:08.450 --> 18:09.747
is because you couldn't
figure it out.

18:09.780 --> 18:10.883
I'm playing the probabilities.

18:10.920 --> 18:12.239
That's what I always do.

18:15.660 --> 18:20.825
So, some priceless artifacts
just came into your possession,

18:20.860 --> 18:24.694
and the fewer questions I have
about said artifacts the better.

18:24.730 --> 18:25.890
Correct.

18:25.930 --> 18:28.660
And this just happened
to be on the day

18:28.700 --> 18:31.362
that you were looking
into Le Chevalier,

18:31.410 --> 18:34.470
and this happens to be
the stuff that he stole.

18:34.510 --> 18:37.206
And the culture will be grateful
for their return.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.901
Mm-hmm.

18:39.950 --> 18:41.918
Y-You're not leaving that?

18:41.950 --> 18:44.316
Oh. (chuckles)

18:44.350 --> 18:47.114
No, this is just something
I picked up for my place.

18:54.660 --> 18:56.890
WATSON:
I'm not okay with this.

18:56.930 --> 18:58.591
You don't like
where it's hanging?

18:58.630 --> 19:02.339
You stole a $50
million painting.

19:02.370 --> 19:04.600
I did not steal it;
I'm just delaying its return.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.608
If I'm going to spend
the evening

19:06.640 --> 19:08.870
reading court transcripts,
I might as well do it

19:08.910 --> 19:11.470
in the company
of a masterpiece.

19:11.510 --> 19:13.319
It really ties
the room together.

19:13.350 --> 19:15.318
Well, you're gonna take
that back to the Aster Museum

19:15.350 --> 19:17.215
(phone ringing)
first thing in the morning.

19:17.250 --> 19:19.218
What's my phone doing up here?

19:19.250 --> 19:22.356
(ringing continues)

19:22.390 --> 19:23.880
Hey, Oren.

19:23.930 --> 19:25.249
Joan.

19:25.290 --> 19:27.622
I'm so excited to see you.

19:27.660 --> 19:29.491
I miss you, sis.
I miss you, too,

19:29.530 --> 19:31.395
but didn't Mom tell you
I'm on a job?

19:31.430 --> 19:33.330
She did,
but I just got your text.

19:33.370 --> 19:35.463
It said you're coming.
From me?

19:35.500 --> 19:37.331
Yeah, you're coming to dinner.

19:37.370 --> 19:38.769
You're bringing your client.
My client?

19:38.810 --> 19:41.278
No, I... well...

19:41.310 --> 19:43.505
Oh, come on, Joan.

19:43.550 --> 19:44.676
Tell me you'll be there.

19:44.710 --> 19:46.769
Uh, I... Yeah.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.209
Yeah, yeah, I'll be there.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.740
We'll talk tomorrow, okay?

19:49.780 --> 19:51.384
Okay. Love you.

19:51.420 --> 19:53.251
Bye.

19:53.290 --> 19:54.655
I put a lock code on here

19:54.690 --> 19:56.248
to prevent you from
sending out texts.

19:56.290 --> 19:57.780
I was hired to breach
The Leviathan.

19:57.830 --> 19:59.957
Do you think I wouldn't be able
to get into your phone?

19:59.990 --> 20:01.526
Yeah, well, you're not
gonna meet my family.

20:01.560 --> 20:02.925
Aren't I? I don't know.

20:02.960 --> 20:04.894
I'm not sure I can be
Without your company

20:04.930 --> 20:07.262
for two hours tomorrow night.
Feeling a little relapse-y.

20:07.300 --> 20:08.938
(gasps)
You're only u5ing that word

20:08.970 --> 20:10.665
because you know
that I can't leave you alone

20:10.710 --> 20:11.938
if you say "relapse."

20:11.970 --> 20:12.937
You just want to meet

20:12.970 --> 20:13.937
my family so you can

20:13.980 --> 20:15.504
put them under a microscope.

20:15.540 --> 20:17.440
Nonsense. You search
your conSCIence, Watson.

20:17.480 --> 20:18.674
If you're really comfortable

20:18.710 --> 20:20.769
going out for dinner
while I dream

20:20.820 --> 20:22.845
of chasing the dragon,
then so be it.

20:22.880 --> 20:25.678
I have a transcript to read.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.953
HOLMES:
Good morning.

20:29.990 --> 20:31.548
Coffee,

20:31.590 --> 20:33.592
yogurt, assorted fruits.

20:33.630 --> 20:34.927
Thanks.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.598
Seven minutes for you
to eat and drink,

20:36.630 --> 20:38.461
23 minutes for you
to shower and get dressed,

20:38.500 --> 20:39.990
should get us
to the property clerk's office

20:40.030 --> 20:41.691
just as it opens.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.799
Why are we going to the
property clerk's office?

20:43.840 --> 20:45.535
That's where they keep
Exhibit C.

20:45.570 --> 20:46.662
Exhibit C
from Carter Averill's trial.

20:48.340 --> 20:49.978
The jury looked at it
three separate times

20:50.010 --> 20:51.841
while they were deliberating.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.541
Well, isn't that what
the jury's supposed to do,

20:53.580 --> 20:54.717
look at the exhibits?

20:54.750 --> 20:56.843
This is a scrap of paper

20:56.880 --> 20:58.347
from the trash bag
that the thieves' landlord

20:58.390 --> 20:59.539
gave to the police.

20:59.590 --> 21:00.989
It's a simple,
handwritten note,

21:01.020 --> 21:03.386
_ a scrawled coffee order
With the names of the criminals

21:03.430 --> 21:05.352
written next to the drinks
that they wanted.

21:05.390 --> 21:06.857
Apparently, they made
a Starbucks run

21:06.890 --> 21:08.448
While they were planning
the heist.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.764
So? Thieves drink coffee, too.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.825
Not my point.
The prosecution used it to prove

21:12.870 --> 21:14.735
that the_ four men
were working together.

21:14.770 --> 21:17.534
After that's done, it's hardly
a trove of information, is it?

21:17.570 --> 21:21.301
Why would the jury need to look
at a coffee order three times?

21:22.380 --> 21:25.349
(sighs)

21:25.380 --> 21:27.644
WATSON:
That looks like a coffee order.

21:27.680 --> 21:29.773
Three of them ordered soy.
I'm surprised they were

21:29.820 --> 21:32.380
so health-conscious.

21:32.420 --> 21:34.012
That looks like something
your printer

21:34.060 --> 21:36.551
spits out when it's trying
to test to see if it works.

21:36.590 --> 21:38.057
It looks like sheer nonsense.

21:38.090 --> 21:40.081
That's what it is supposed
to look like.

21:40.130 --> 21:42.928
It's a programming language
called "Malbolge."

21:42.960 --> 21:45.622
It was designed
to be impenetrable.

21:45.670 --> 21:48.332
The language's creator named it
after the eighth circle of hell

21:48.370 --> 21:50.361
in Dante's Inferno.

21:50.410 --> 21:51.661
Now, there are few people
in the world

21:51.710 --> 21:52.836
who can even recognize Malbolge

21:52.870 --> 21:54.406
as anything other
than gibberish.

21:54.440 --> 21:55.976
Fewer still
who can write sobeare

21:56.010 --> 21:57.568
using it.

21:57.610 --> 21:58.872
I learned about the language

21:58.910 --> 22:00.571
from a consultant
I used in London.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.975
She should be _able
to get us a translation soon.

22:03.020 --> 22:06.114
The important thing is
it's a message.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.710
It was hidden in plain sight
throughout the trial.

22:08.760 --> 22:11.524
Do you think someone
from the jury recognized it?

22:11.560 --> 22:14.120
Why else would they ask to see
a coffee order

22:14.160 --> 22:15.855
again and again, hmm?

22:15.900 --> 22:19.666
Here you are. Justin Guthrie.

22:19.700 --> 22:21.463
Unemployed at the time
of the trial,

22:21.500 --> 22:22.660
_ but listed _
his preVIous occupation

22:22.700 --> 22:24.133
as "software engineer."

22:24.170 --> 22:27.936
Shall we see if he's familiar
with Malbolge?

22:27.980 --> 22:30.130
So what do we do
if this guy Guthrie says

22:30.180 --> 22:32.000
he doesn't know what
you're talking about?

22:32.050 --> 22:33.642
We can start
by seeing

22:33.680 --> 22:35.409
if he's got any
diamonds lying around.

22:35.450 --> 22:37.941
(phone chimes)

22:37.990 --> 22:39.787
That's it.

22:39.820 --> 22:42.653
They attacked the
random number generator.

22:43.860 --> 22:45.418
That does not say,

22:45.460 --> 22:47.018
"they attacked
the random number generator."

22:47.060 --> 22:48.652
It's an algorithm,
Watson.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.668
This is a translation
of the coded Malbolge,

22:50.700 --> 22:52.827
sent by my contact
in London.

22:52.870 --> 22:55.964
This is how
the first team

22:56.000 --> 22:57.763
of thieves got into
The Leviathan.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.108
_ The yault's software
is deSIgned to spit out

23:00.140 --> 23:03.109
ten random digits
every two minutes.

23:03.140 --> 23:05.108
This makes it
impossible to predict

23:05.150 --> 23:07.573
the access code at
any given moment.

23:07.620 --> 23:10.589
The genius of the original
plan is this algorithm.

23:10.620 --> 23:13.453
They hacked the software,
fed the equation into it.

23:13.490 --> 23:14.912
It spits out
escalating multiples

23:14.960 --> 23:16.882
of the number pi
every two minutes.

23:16.920 --> 23:18.148
Pi is infinite,

23:18.190 --> 23:19.987
so if you take a
ten-digit sample,

23:20.030 --> 23:21.588
the numbers still
appear random.

23:21.630 --> 23:22.995
But if you know
the algorithm,

23:23.030 --> 23:24.588
you can predict
the code.

23:24.630 --> 23:26.666
Yes. Even after you leave,
it still looks like

23:26.700 --> 23:28.930
the software is
functioning perfectly, hmm?

23:28.970 --> 23:31.131
Justin Guthrie must have
translated the Malbolge,

23:31.170 --> 23:33.775
realized that he had the key
for cracking The Leviathan.

23:33.810 --> 23:35.209
Well, any Leviathan.

23:35.240 --> 23:38.641
So, a guy on the jury
planned a $40-million heist?

23:38.680 --> 23:40.147
Well, he had help,
obviously.

23:40.180 --> 23:42.045
But that's exactly
what he did.

23:42.080 --> 23:43.149
When you've eliminated
the impossible,

23:43.180 --> 23:44.181
Watson, Whatever
remains...

23:44.220 --> 23:45.812
Yeah, you said
that already.

23:45.850 --> 23:48.182
Officer, we need to get
into the building.

23:48.220 --> 23:49.653
Sorry, pal, no can do.

23:49.690 --> 23:51.055
This is an active
investigation.

23:51.090 --> 23:52.648
Yes. I'm a consultant
with the NYPD,

23:52.690 --> 23:54.749
and I need to speak to
one of the tenants.

23:54.800 --> 23:55.949
His name is
Justin Guthrie.

23:56.000 --> 23:57.149
You said Guthrie?

23:57.200 --> 23:59.566
Yes. Shall I spell
it for you? G...

23:59.600 --> 24:01.033
No, but considering he's
the one we're here for,

24:01.070 --> 24:02.628
you might want to talk
to one of the detectives.

24:04.670 --> 24:06.865
of his apartment
a little While ago.

24:13.010 --> 24:15.114
(garbled radio transmission)

24:15.150 --> 24:17.516
(light melody playing)

24:27.800 --> 24:30.769
So the precinct detective says
this is a suicide,

24:30.800 --> 24:35.567
but you think that he stole
$40 million in diamonds

24:35.600 --> 24:37.192
and then got killed
behind it?

24:37.240 --> 24:38.798
So what's the story?

24:40.580 --> 24:41.877
(music stops)

24:41.910 --> 24:45.607
Obviously, a violent
altercation took place.

24:45.650 --> 24:47.538
Blood evidence.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.042
Myself and Miss Watson
found it

24:52.090 --> 24:54.752
and examined it closely.

24:54.790 --> 24:59.250
Spatter pattern indicates
it's a high forced event.

24:59.290 --> 25:02.657
He's saying the blood came from
someone who was hit in the nose.

25:02.700 --> 25:04.918
Okay. It's worth
looking into.

25:04.970 --> 25:07.188
I still don't see the connection
to that robbery.

25:07.230 --> 25:09.835
I was just thinking about
that when you arrived.

25:09.870 --> 25:12.600
The answer, of course,
lies in those vases.

25:15.610 --> 25:18.602
These two has three layers
of decorative rock,

25:18.650 --> 25:20.277
_each one
a different color.

25:20.310 --> 25:23.108
This one has two layers,

25:23.150 --> 25:25.118
but the mineral residue
on the glass indicates

25:25.150 --> 25:26.708
_that it was full
till very recently.

25:26.750 --> 25:28.286
Many of the stones stolen

25:28.320 --> 25:30.754
from the Svalbard Exchange
were uncut diamonds.

25:30.790 --> 25:33.725
They happen to look exactly
like decorative rocks.

25:33.760 --> 25:36.024
Now, if you'd just stolen some,

25:36.060 --> 25:38.620
this vase would be
an ideal hiding place.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.991
I'm guessing that
whichever co-conspirator

25:41.040 --> 25:43.736
just relieved Mr. Guthrie
of his share

25:43.770 --> 25:45.306
of the diamonds
thought the same thing.

25:45.340 --> 25:47.069
He was, however,
in a hurry.

25:53.650 --> 25:55.709
He might have missed one.

25:55.750 --> 25:57.843
You're telling us
that's a...?

25:57.890 --> 25:59.289
Uncut diamond.

25:59.320 --> 26:01.015
Let's get some more
detectives down here.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.914
I want to start
a full-scale canvass.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.858
Looks like we have
a murder on our hands.

26:07.900 --> 26:10.789
Look, it's almost 6:00.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.161
We have to start getting ready.

26:12.200 --> 26:15.863
Oh, right.
Dinner With your family.

26:15.900 --> 26:18.698
Well, as you said, this is now
a murder investigation.

26:18.740 --> 26:20.628
You'll understand
if I can't make it.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.636
Absolutely.

26:26.750 --> 26:28.240
HOLMES: And I would never
have been able

26:28.280 --> 26:30.248
to prove that you
were a murderer.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.645
(laughter)

26:31.690 --> 26:33.112
Joan, you're here.
Excellent.

26:33.150 --> 26:35.755
I was just telling your
family about my work.

26:35.790 --> 26:37.018
Hi there.

26:37.060 --> 26:39.722
This lovely young lady
is Gabrielle.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.625
She's your brother's girlfriend;
soon, I expect, fiance.

26:41.660 --> 26:43.127
_It's so nice to
finally meet you.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.718
It's so nice
to meet you.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.362
Oren talks about you
all the time.
(chuckles)

26:46.400 --> 26:47.833
(quietly):
What happened to,

26:47.870 --> 26:49.633
"this is_a murder
investigation"?

26:49.670 --> 26:51.809
_ In a bit of a lull
right now, actually.

26:51.840 --> 26:52.932
We're awaiting
the results

26:52.970 --> 26:54.733
of the DNA tests
on the blood.

26:54.780 --> 26:57.169
And I saw a chance to spend
some time with your family,

26:57.210 --> 26:58.973
and I took it.

26:59.010 --> 27:02.741
Joan, is it true you helped
prove the CIO of Canon Ebersole

27:02.780 --> 27:04.338
had a secretary who killed
five people?

27:04.390 --> 27:07.018
Uh, not really.
I just helped out a little.

27:07.050 --> 27:09.086
She was instrumental
in solvmg that case.

27:09.120 --> 27:11.953
She also went to the trouble
of saVIng my life.

27:11.990 --> 27:14.094
Quite a promising detective
in her own right.

27:14.130 --> 27:15.791
I'm not a detective.

27:15.830 --> 27:17.695
I just, I'm along for
the ride for a while.

27:17.730 --> 27:19.163
You're being modest.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.339
That's not the only case
she's helped me solve.

27:21.370 --> 27:24.362
Hard to picture
what she does, isn't it?

27:24.410 --> 27:25.809
"Sober companion."

27:25.840 --> 27:27.671
When I first heard
that term,

27:27.710 --> 27:30.201
I couldn't imagine what it
entailed, and I'm an addict.

27:30.240 --> 27:33.073
(laughter)

27:33.110 --> 27:35.340
She practices quite a
unique specialty, your daughter.

27:35.380 --> 27:37.348
She rebuilds lives
from the ground up.

27:37.380 --> 27:41.089
You can measure her success
in careers restored.

27:41.120 --> 27:46.319
In my case, criminals
caught and in lives saved.

27:46.360 --> 27:48.055
Interesting.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.091
Never thought of it like that.

27:50.130 --> 27:51.324
Of course you haven't.

27:51.370 --> 27:53.099
You've raised
a modest daughter.

27:53.130 --> 27:54.267
She would never
say such a thing.

27:54.300 --> 27:56.268
Shall we order?

27:56.300 --> 28:00.703
I hear the rabbit
is a-ma-zmg.

28:02.380 --> 28:04.200
I know you're gonna
blow this off,

28:04.250 --> 28:07.003
but I'm gonna say it
anyway: thank you.

28:07.050 --> 28:11.146
I've never been able to make
my family understand What I do.

28:11.190 --> 28:14.353
Yes, well, I meant very
little of What I said.

28:14.390 --> 28:16.881
There's the blowing-off part.

28:16.920 --> 28:18.353
I know my audience.

28:18.390 --> 28:23.760
I simply told them What
they wanted to hear.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.290
They're nice people,
your family,

28:25.330 --> 28:29.938
but they are, at their
core, conventional.

28:29.970 --> 28:31.835
You make an effort to
appearconvenbonaL

28:31.870 --> 28:36.170
but I know, Watson, you share
my love of all that is bizarre

28:36.210 --> 28:39.179
and outside the humdrum
routine of ordinary life.

28:39.210 --> 28:41.314
Your family Will never
understand this,

28:41.350 --> 28:44.080
so I gave them some words
that they would understand.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.916
What?

28:49.960 --> 28:51.325
I'm just curious

28:51.360 --> 28:53.521
_as to who Justin Guthrie_
might have collaborated With

28:53.560 --> 28:55.323
to rob the
diamond exchange.

28:55.360 --> 28:57.920
I've been sifting through
his phone in my downtime.

28:57.970 --> 29:00.791
That's the dead guy's phone?
Isn't that evidence?

29:00.840 --> 29:03.195
Yeah, well, I will give it
back When I'm finished.

29:03.240 --> 29:06.368
He stored three phone numbers
in his notes section.

29:06.410 --> 29:08.537
Each one has just a first name
next to it:

29:08.580 --> 29:10.036
Jeremy, Amelie, Alex.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.298
These are the names
of three people

29:12.350 --> 29:14.272
with Whom he served
on the jury.

29:14.320 --> 29:16.140
So they kept in touch.

29:16.180 --> 29:18.341
Have you served
jury service?

29:18.390 --> 29:20.449
Did you have
any desire

29:20.490 --> 29:24.449
to see those people
again when it was over?

29:26.460 --> 29:30.328
(opera music playing loudly)

29:32.030 --> 29:33.258
It's 3:00 in the morning!

29:33.300 --> 29:35.097
(volume decreases)

29:35.140 --> 29:37.199
It's nearly finished.
Don't turn it down.

29:37.240 --> 29:38.969
I'm basking.

29:39.010 --> 29:40.204
(volume increases)

29:40.240 --> 29:41.969
Can't you bask
in the morning?

29:42.010 --> 29:42.977
(music stops)

29:43.010 --> 29:45.149
It's this case, Watson.

29:45.180 --> 29:47.842
It_ renews one's_ faith
in the profe55ion.

29:47.880 --> 29:51.247
It's _a life of boundless
surprises, detective work.

29:51.290 --> 29:54.054
Do I have to find you
a drug test?

29:54.090 --> 29:57.218
These are the four men Who broke

29:57.260 --> 29:59.478
into The Leviathan
in 2010.

29:59.530 --> 30:01.953
Now, we've already met
Charles Briggs, lock-pick

30:02.000 --> 30:03.422
and locksmith extraordinaire.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.462
This is Vance Paulson.

30:05.500 --> 30:07.320
He_was the
in5ide man.

30:07.370 --> 30:09.292
The late Carter Averill,

30:09.340 --> 30:11.399
organizer of the crime,
genius.

30:11.440 --> 30:13.135
He mastered everything from
computer coding

30:13.170 --> 30:15.331
to surveillance software.

30:15.380 --> 30:20.147
And, finally, David Retts,
PhD in electrical engineering.

30:20.180 --> 30:22.978
Nothing about this is making me
want to bask.

30:23.020 --> 30:24.385
I haven't got
to the good bit yet.

30:24.420 --> 30:26.217
We already know

30:26.250 --> 30:28.013
that Justin _Guthrie's
programming skills

30:28.060 --> 30:32.281
allowed him to perform much the
same function as Carter Averill.

30:32.330 --> 30:35.549
Now _let's meet
some of his fellow jurors.

30:35.600 --> 30:40.299
Alex Wilson worked as
an electrical engineer

30:40.330 --> 30:44.039
until his employer forced
early retirement on him.

30:44.070 --> 30:45.298
Jeremy Lopez,

30:45.340 --> 30:47.205
son of a locksmith.

30:47.240 --> 30:51.643
Paid his way through school
by plying his father's trade.

30:51.680 --> 30:54.240
So you're saying that Justin
Guthrie committed this robbery

30:54.280 --> 30:55.941
with other members of the jury?

30:55.980 --> 30:57.277
Probably started as a joke.

30:57.320 --> 30:59.288
Jurors spend
a lot of time together.

30:59.320 --> 31:01.117
Lots of idle chitchat, hmm?

31:01.160 --> 31:03.958
They noted that between them,
they had the same skill set

31:03.990 --> 31:06.185
as the thieves
they were trying.

31:06.230 --> 31:08.448
Once Justin Guthrie spotted
the coded programming language,

31:08.500 --> 31:10.149
things turned serious.

31:10.200 --> 31:11.622
They realized
they'd been handed the recipe

31:11.670 --> 31:13.194
for making millions of dollars.

31:13.230 --> 31:16.358
So, who was the inside man?

31:16.400 --> 31:18.607
This is Amelie Widomski,

31:18.640 --> 31:21.473
a homemaker
from Roosevelt Island.

31:21.510 --> 31:24.604
Icouldn't make any sense
of it until I noticed

31:24.650 --> 31:27.346
that she'd written her maiden
name on some paperwork.

31:27.380 --> 31:30.042
Amelie Widomski was born
"Amelie Batonvert."

31:30.080 --> 31:31.047
Green Stick.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.217
The manager of

31:33.250 --> 31:37.482
the Svalbard Diamond Exchange
is her brother.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.125
Whether he was in on it
or whether she just used

31:40.160 --> 31:42.492
the family connection to gain
access during working hours,

31:42.530 --> 31:45.624
these are the four people
who robbed

31:45.670 --> 31:47.968
the Svalbard Diamond Exchange
two days ago.

31:48.000 --> 31:52.107
And one of them is killing
the others to keep the proceeds.

31:52.140 --> 31:53.937
GREGSON: Okay, ten jurors,
two alternates.

31:53.980 --> 31:55.936
The only surviving juror
we couldn't find is Alex Wilson.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.379
That's the engineer.

31:57.410 --> 31:59.549
You think he has something
to do with this, right?

31:59.580 --> 32:01.411
So, assuming you're right
about what happened,

32:01.450 --> 32:03.111
he's probably in the wind.

32:03.150 --> 32:05.038
Seems like
he could be our guy.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.341
Maybe, but I believe

32:06.390 --> 32:08.950
our killer is standing
in that room.

32:08.990 --> 32:10.355
That man is named
Jeremy Lopez.

32:10.390 --> 32:12.688
Even from here, you can
see his face is injured.

32:12.730 --> 32:14.357
You think Justin Guthrie
did that to him?

32:14.400 --> 32:15.697
Should be easy enough
to find out.

32:15.730 --> 32:17.197
(door opens)

32:17.230 --> 32:19.528
Ladies and gentlemen, um,

32:19.570 --> 32:22.437
so I'd like to start
by thanking you all

32:22.470 --> 32:24.062
for fulfilling your civic duty.

32:24.110 --> 32:27.364
The justice system called,
12 of you answered. Yes.

32:27.410 --> 32:29.401
Unfortunately, it seems that

32:29.440 --> 32:33.171
four of your number have become
criminals themselves,

32:33.210 --> 32:34.711
and one of those four

32:34.750 --> 32:37.116
is now a murderer.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.219
Shocking, I know.

32:40.250 --> 32:42.115
But we have
obtained a sample

32:42.160 --> 32:43.616
of the murderer's blood.

32:43.660 --> 32:45.753
Now it's a simple case
of comparing your DNA

32:45.790 --> 32:49.328
to that sample,
and we'll have our killer.

32:49.360 --> 32:52.158
Okay, you can start.

32:53.430 --> 32:55.295
HOLMES:
Please, bear in mind,

32:55.340 --> 32:57.467
we cannot force you
to give samples.

32:57.500 --> 32:59.058
But you've already
demonstrated

32:59.110 --> 33:00.634
your civic-mindedness
by serving as jurors,

33:00.670 --> 33:03.605
and I'm sure that the innocent
amongst you Will relish

33:03.640 --> 33:05.403
the chance to help
catch a murderer.

33:06.810 --> 33:07.777
If, however,
you recently

33:07.810 --> 33:09.675
did murder Justin Guthrie,

33:09.720 --> 33:12.041
you certainly should not
offer a sample.

33:12.090 --> 33:13.409
Uh, that would be folly.

33:18.490 --> 33:20.355
Everything all right, Mr. Lopez?

33:24.570 --> 33:26.720
Fine, fine.

33:28.370 --> 33:29.689
All right, everyone,

33:29.740 --> 33:31.139
you can go now.

33:31.170 --> 33:32.762
Thank you very much
for your time.

33:42.250 --> 33:44.081
make sure they
don't try to flee.

33:44.120 --> 33:46.486
Maybe he gave us that sample
because he knew if he didn't,

33:46.520 --> 33:48.488
we'd know
it was him.
(scoffs)

33:48.520 --> 33:50.681
I know. He seemed
pretty confident.

33:50.720 --> 33:53.086
Why would a killer just
hand off his DNA like that?

33:53.130 --> 33:54.222
I don't believe he would.

33:54.260 --> 33:55.727
BELL:
Captain.

33:55.760 --> 33:58.627
We just heard from an officer
in Irvington, New Jersey.

33:58.670 --> 34:00.422
Guy saw our BOLO
on Alex Wilson.

34:00.470 --> 34:02.768
This cop swears he saw Wilson
couple days ago.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.438
Gave us an address.

34:04.470 --> 34:06.131
We need to find him.

34:06.170 --> 34:08.377
I may have been wrong
about Jeremy Lopez,

34:08.410 --> 34:10.503
and I doubt Amelie Widomski
could throw a man

34:10.540 --> 34:13.577
out of a window,
so if Lopez is not our man,

34:13.610 --> 34:15.669
then Alex Wilson must be.

34:17.550 --> 34:18.517
(knocks)

34:18.550 --> 34:20.245
NYPD! Open up!

34:20.290 --> 34:21.518
(knocks)

34:21.560 --> 34:23.516
Let's go.
Open up or we're coming in.

34:23.560 --> 34:26.529
(flies buzzing)

34:26.560 --> 34:29.449
Detective, uh,
I'm concerned there's no need

34:29.500 --> 34:31.661
to look for Mr. Wilson inside.

34:31.700 --> 34:33.520
Not with this many
coffin flies around.

34:33.570 --> 34:35.128
Coffin flies?

34:35.170 --> 34:38.662
Small, humpbacked members
of the Phoridae family.

34:38.710 --> 34:40.337
They feed on decaying corpses.

34:40.370 --> 34:42.429
They're congregating
on this cardboard.

34:42.480 --> 34:45.699
(flies buzzing)

34:53.890 --> 34:55.687
Looks like he's been
dead at least two days.

34:55.720 --> 34:58.723
He didn't kill
Justin Guthrie yesterday.

35:05.300 --> 35:06.790
Oh, good, you're back.

35:06.830 --> 35:08.730
We just got the preliminary
DNA results

35:08.770 --> 35:10.761
back from
Justin Guthrie's apartment.

35:10.800 --> 35:14.804
It doesn't match Jeremy Lopez,
it doesn't match Alex Wilson.

35:14.840 --> 35:19.209
It belongs to an Army chaplain
by the name of Audrey Higuerra.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.468
What's her connection
to the jury?

35:21.520 --> 35:23.715
As far as we know,
she doesn't have one.

35:23.750 --> 35:25.240
HOLMES:
Seems rather noble,

35:25.290 --> 35:27.508
this Audrey Higuerra,
doesn't she?

35:27.550 --> 35:29.211
Very noble indeed.

35:29.260 --> 35:30.659
I don't like her.

35:30.690 --> 35:32.658
Is that because she's a chaplain
or because she has

35:32.690 --> 35:34.294
a "Habitat For Humanity" sticker
in her window?

35:34.330 --> 35:36.491
I don't like her
because she doesn't fit.

35:36.530 --> 35:38.919
It was a beautiful theory,
not a hair out of place.

35:38.970 --> 35:41.632
The first robbery, the team
of jurors-turned-criminals

35:41.670 --> 35:44.400
who turned on each other
like a pack of rabid dogs.

35:44.440 --> 35:45.862
But this Audrey
Higuerra--

35:45.910 --> 35:47.832
she doesn't have any
connection to these people.

35:47.870 --> 35:49.701
She doesn't
fit anywhere.

35:49.740 --> 35:52.504
Well, we found her blood in
Justin Guthrie's apartment.

35:52.550 --> 35:53.903
And someone once said

35:53.950 --> 35:55.679
once you've eliminated
the impossible,

35:55.720 --> 35:58.484
Whatever remains, no matter
how improbable, is the truth.

35:58.520 --> 35:59.839
Sounds like a Windbag.

36:01.990 --> 36:04.379
I don't see anything here
that supports the idea

36:04.430 --> 36:06.182
that she was
a murderer.

36:06.230 --> 36:07.185
HOLMES:
Quite the opposite.

36:07.230 --> 36:08.857
IfI could attribute

36:08.900 --> 36:13.360
three miracles to her, I would
nominate her for sainthood.

36:13.400 --> 36:16.597
Yeah, looks like she's got the
caring for the sick part down.

36:16.640 --> 36:20.360
She nursed her sister
through cancer.

36:20.410 --> 36:24.506
So, not only is Audrey Higuerra
not to be found in her own home,

36:24.550 --> 36:25.903
she's not even in the country.

36:25.950 --> 36:27.679
We just found her calendar.

36:27.710 --> 36:30.941
Turns out, she was deployed
to Kabul a couple weeks ago.

36:30.980 --> 36:32.516
That can't be.

36:32.550 --> 36:34.381
We just found a fresh
blood sample, hers,

36:34.420 --> 36:35.887
in Justin Guthrie's
apartment yesterday.

36:35.920 --> 36:37.649
We're waiting
on the Army to confirm

36:37.690 --> 36:39.521
that she's posted overseas,
but, I mean, look around.

36:39.560 --> 36:41.790
Does it look like anyone's
been here recently?

36:41.830 --> 36:43.491
Can I take back
everything I said

36:43.530 --> 36:44.929
about eliminating
the impossible?

36:44.970 --> 36:46.267
Why would you want to do that?

36:46.300 --> 36:47.267
Because Audrey Higuerra's sister

36:47.300 --> 36:48.494
died of leukemia.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.929
And then once she was gone,
Audrey did

36:50.970 --> 36:53.268
everything she could to help
people with the same disease.

36:53.310 --> 36:55.369
I used to see this at the
hospital all the time.

36:55.410 --> 36:56.934
They give them
to bone marrow donors.

36:58.310 --> 37:00.505
HOLMES: Do you still
have a police detail

37:00.550 --> 37:01.812
following Jeremy Lopez?

37:01.850 --> 37:04.444
We called it off
when the DNA results came back.

37:04.490 --> 37:06.981
You need to find him,
bring him in immediately.

37:15.360 --> 37:16.793
I don't know
Why I'm back here.

37:16.830 --> 37:18.525
I already gave
you people my DNA.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.424
Yeah, we had a little
problem with that.

37:20.470 --> 37:22.495
Something went wrong
with one of the swabs.

37:22.540 --> 37:25.964
If it's not too much trouble,
we'd like to get a blood sample.

37:26.010 --> 37:27.762
It's a cleaner read.

37:27.810 --> 37:29.903
I've already been very helpful.

37:29.940 --> 37:31.339
Generous, even.

37:31.380 --> 37:32.540
But, honestly,
I don't like needles.

37:32.580 --> 37:34.343
I don't see why I should...

37:34.380 --> 37:35.540
HOLMES:
There they are.

37:35.580 --> 37:36.717
The e_vasions_
and rhetorical curlicues

37:36.750 --> 37:38.342
of a man with something to hide.

37:38.390 --> 37:39.709
I don't have anything to hide.

37:39.750 --> 37:42.617
You had leukemia; is
that correct, Jeremy?

37:42.660 --> 37:44.321
Yeah. Five years ago.

37:44.360 --> 37:45.622
I'm better now.
Good.

37:45.660 --> 37:46.820
And you're better because of

37:46.860 --> 37:48.452
a bone marrow
transplant, right?

37:48.500 --> 37:50.855
Did you know that one
of the side effects

37:50.900 --> 37:53.869
of a bone marrow transplant
is that your body

37:53.900 --> 37:56.869
begins to manufacture cells
that bear the DNA of your donor?

37:56.900 --> 37:58.458
Right.

37:58.510 --> 37:59.932
And bone marrow
manufactures blood.

37:59.970 --> 38:02.837
So you know that every
recipient of a transplant

38:02.880 --> 38:04.745
walks around with the
DNA of their donor

38:04.780 --> 38:06.441
coursing through
their veins.

38:06.480 --> 38:10.576
But the DNA in your skin,
your hair, your saliva,

38:10.620 --> 38:12.941
that's all your own.

38:12.990 --> 38:15.550
The blood that we found at
Justin Guthrie's apartment,

38:15.590 --> 38:17.979
it bears the DNA
of Audrey Higuerra,

38:18.020 --> 38:19.829
but it came
from your body.

38:19.860 --> 38:22.420
You knew that you could
give us a saliva sample,

38:22.460 --> 38:24.496
because the DNA
wouldn't match the blood

38:24.530 --> 38:26.361
that we found at
the crime scene.

38:26.400 --> 38:31.633
I cannot believe that you are
dragging my illness into this.

38:31.670 --> 38:34.878
You stole $40 million, and then
you murdered two people.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.109
I'm leaving.

38:38.140 --> 38:39.471
Don't call me.

38:39.510 --> 38:40.772
Don't expect me
to cooperate.

38:40.810 --> 38:44.041
Oh, we don't need
your cooperation.

38:46.050 --> 38:47.779
What's that?

38:47.820 --> 38:49.014
Court order.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.756
Compels you to give us
a blood sample.

38:51.790 --> 38:52.779
HOLMES:
We neglected to mention

38:52.830 --> 38:53.785
that we had that

38:53.830 --> 38:54.899
when we first came in.

38:54.930 --> 38:55.919
Yes.

38:55.960 --> 38:57.655
Well, we just didn't want

38:57.700 --> 39:00.021
to deny ourselves the pleasure
of watching you squirm.

39:00.070 --> 39:02.493
You give us
enough to arrest

39:02.540 --> 39:05.703
Amelie Widomski for her part
in the robbery, and who knows?

39:05.740 --> 39:09.574
Maybe a parole board
will see you before you're dead.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.717
Such a shame.

39:20.750 --> 39:23.719
Those bottles cost $500 apiece.

39:23.760 --> 39:25.955
You'd think if they wanted
to thank me with champagne,

39:25.990 --> 39:30.552
they'd go to the trouble
of finding out if I drink first.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.488
Have a glass if you like.

39:32.530 --> 39:35.465
You figured out Audrey Higuerra
was a bone marrow donor.

39:35.500 --> 39:38.037
Pretty sure that's
not a good idea.

39:38.070 --> 39:40.709
Is the smell
gonna bother you?

39:40.740 --> 39:45.575
I suppose being proven right
is the best gift of all.

39:45.610 --> 39:46.577
Hmm.

39:46.610 --> 39:47.907
There was no genius

39:47.950 --> 39:50.475
who independently
cracked The Leviathan.

39:50.520 --> 39:52.715
It was a question
of copying the original team.

39:52.750 --> 39:53.887
Ah.

39:53.920 --> 39:55.615
So that means you still might be

39:55.660 --> 39:57.013
the smartest person
in the world.

39:57.060 --> 39:58.482
I would never suggest that.

39:58.530 --> 39:59.758
Really?

39:59.790 --> 40:01.451
I think that's the first time

40:01.500 --> 40:03.195
I've ever heard you say
anything remotely modest.

40:03.230 --> 40:04.925
It's not modesty.

40:04.970 --> 40:07.461
There's just no reliable way
to test the hypothesis.

40:07.500 --> 40:08.990
(doorbell rings)

40:09.040 --> 40:11.804
Triplets?

40:20.780 --> 40:23.010
Mom?

40:23.050 --> 40:25.086
I know I'm not
supposed to come see you

40:25.120 --> 40:26.917
While you're out on a job,

40:26.950 --> 40:29.487
but you did give me your card
the other night.

40:29.520 --> 40:31.488
I was hoping
to talk to my daughter.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.088
HOLMES: _
Mm, please, come in.

40:33.130 --> 40:36.622
Thank you.

40:36.660 --> 40:39.697
I'll leave you
two to chat.

40:43.670 --> 40:47.504
It's, uh... nice.

40:47.540 --> 40:49.201
I've never seen
anything like it,

40:49.240 --> 40:53.040
but it seems like, uh,
it suits your client.

40:53.080 --> 40:55.776
So, you just wanted to come over
here to see Where I'm staying?

40:55.820 --> 40:59.938
I know you think that I
don't like your new career.

40:59.990 --> 41:02.515
To put it mildly.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.084
You're right, I don't like it.

41:04.120 --> 41:07.180
But not for the reasons
that you think.

41:07.230 --> 41:09.255
I'm not happy
that you're a sober companion

41:09.300 --> 41:11.188
because it never seems
to make you happy.

41:11.230 --> 41:13.596
How do you know
what makes me happy?

41:13.630 --> 41:16.030
I know because
you're my daughter.

41:18.070 --> 41:21.233
(sighs)

41:23.840 --> 41:27.776
After you left medicine,
after what happened with Liam,

41:27.810 --> 41:29.778
I've always thought
that this job

41:29.820 --> 41:33.711
was something that
you picked out of...

41:33.750 --> 41:36.514
I don't know, out
of a sense of duty.

41:36.560 --> 41:39.085
When you came to dinner
the other night,

41:39.130 --> 41:41.894
when the two of you talked
about Sherlock's work,

41:41.930 --> 41:45.889
I saw something
in you.

41:45.930 --> 41:48.023
There was a spark.

41:48.070 --> 41:50.595
A sense of
eXCItement.

41:50.640 --> 41:53.165
_ I haven't seen that
in you in a long time.

41:53.210 --> 41:56.236
You like
what he does.

41:56.280 --> 41:59.249
Yes, okay, I enjoy it.

41:59.280 --> 42:01.748
But I'm not a detective, Mom.

42:01.780 --> 42:03.179
And I'm almost done
working with Sherlock,

42:03.220 --> 42:04.983
and then it's on
to another client.

42:05.020 --> 42:07.284
Will the next client
make you happy?

42:08.990 --> 42:13.029
People find their paths
in the strangest of ways.

42:14.900 --> 42:16.595
So sorry to interrupt.

42:16.630 --> 42:17.858
I've just, I've seen

42:17.900 --> 42:19.697
the most incredible thing
on the news.

42:19.730 --> 42:21.869
I'm quite sure
you'd want to see it.

42:21.900 --> 42:23.561
REPORTER: The police
are puzzled by the sudden

42:23.600 --> 42:25.101
and unexplained return

42:25.140 --> 42:27.700
of Vincent Van Gogh's
masterpiece, Piet.

42:27.740 --> 42:29.230
It was delivered
by courier to the head

42:29.280 --> 42:31.305
of the Aster Museum
of Modern Art.

42:31.340 --> 42:34.173
The NYPD is speculating
that the thief must have been

42:34.210 --> 42:35.609
suffering from
a guilty conscience,

42:35.650 --> 42:37.641
but the exact motive
for the return

42:37.680 --> 42:39.887
remains a mystery.
