00:07.549 --> 00:12.043
To keep his identity from being
revealed while turning Super Saiyan,

00:12.262 --> 00:16.096
Gohan had a transformation device made.

00:20.813 --> 00:24.431
Meanwhile, Videl,
with her proficient combat skills,

00:24.650 --> 00:27.187
keeps the peace in the city,

00:27.403 --> 00:31.146
but finds herself in a desperate pinch.

00:35.244 --> 00:40.113
But then, the new hero,
Great Saiyaman, appears!

00:42.000 --> 00:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here

00:53.595 --> 00:55.426
They're gonna crash!

00:55.639 --> 00:57.140
What's that?!

01:07.943 --> 01:09.604
The plane, which was suffering
from engine trouble,

01:09.820 --> 01:12.607
thus made a safe landing at Satan Airport.

01:12.823 --> 01:16.782
Great Saiyaman once again
saved many precious lives today.

01:16.994 --> 01:19.531
Mr. Saiyaman, what do you think
about the fuss being made

01:19.747 --> 01:22.363
that you are the heroic
successor to Mister Satan?

01:22.583 --> 01:23.538
How do you feel about your feats?

01:23.751 --> 01:26.037
Do you have any comment?

01:26.253 --> 01:28.289
What's a guy to do?

01:32.009 --> 01:37.879
Robbery, killing, and hijacking!
From little things to big things!

01:38.098 --> 01:41.090
When I see wrongdoing, I cannot let it stand!

01:49.443 --> 01:51.229
That's who I am.

01:54.072 --> 01:55.903
That's beyond lame.

03:23.412 --> 03:28.873
"Videl's Crisis?! Son Gohan's Urgent Call-out!"

03:31.545 --> 03:33.786
Fire! Fire!

03:35.883 --> 03:37.373
I heard there were some people

03:37.593 --> 03:38.958
who didn't make it out in time on the roof!

03:39.177 --> 03:40.883
Really?!

03:42.514 --> 03:45.847
Help us!

03:46.059 --> 03:47.765
Can't we get any closer?

03:47.978 --> 03:51.061
No, we can't, Videl-san!
With the updraft from the fire,

03:51.273 --> 03:52.763
this is as close as we can get!

03:52.983 --> 03:55.440
Unless we do something, those people...!

04:01.992 --> 04:04.699
Hey, I see a large water tank down there.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.652
Can't we do something with that?

04:06.872 --> 04:08.203
Do something like what?

04:08.415 --> 04:10.781
Like use the water to put out the fire!

04:12.961 --> 04:14.201
If you open the valve,

04:14.421 --> 04:16.332
all it will do is go down
the pipe and be distributed,

04:16.548 --> 04:21.382
not put the fire out. However,
the valve is still disconnected.

04:21.595 --> 04:24.086
And if I open it, water will come out, right?

04:24.306 --> 04:27.173
But, while it will flow out onto the roof,

04:27.392 --> 04:29.804
I doubt it will put out the fire
inside the building.

04:30.020 --> 04:33.057
It should still buy us a little time.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.264
Videl-san, you don't mean...!

04:35.484 --> 04:37.475
It's all or nothing!

04:38.487 --> 04:40.068
Videl-san!

04:43.742 --> 04:44.527
Here it is.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.233
Yow!

04:54.378 --> 04:56.334
|-|t won't open!

05:02.844 --> 05:04.880
It's all over now!

05:17.067 --> 05:19.433
The Great Saiyaman has arrived!

05:19.653 --> 05:21.894
--Huh?
--Now, stand aside.

05:27.119 --> 05:28.609
All right...

05:49.433 --> 05:51.890
Th-They' re saved!

06:14.499 --> 06:16.660
Today, thanks to the actions
of the Great Saiyaman,

06:16.877 --> 06:18.583
more precious lives were saved.

06:18.795 --> 06:22.538
Satan City's new hero is,
indeed, the Great Saiyaman!

06:22.758 --> 06:25.465
Ha! Champion ofjustice, my foot.

06:25.677 --> 06:30.762
Compared to the great Satan-sama,
he's still on too small a scale!

06:34.728 --> 06:36.264
I'm leaving!

06:44.321 --> 06:46.312
Big Brother!

06:46.531 --> 06:48.908
Big Brother, come back safely!

06:49.117 --> 06:52.234
Goten, you've gotten so you can
ride Kinto Un pretty well, huh?

06:52.454 --> 06:55.571
Ha-ha! You're looking good, too, Big Brother!

06:55.791 --> 06:57.782
Okay, off | go!

06:58.001 --> 06:59.741
Bye-bye!

07:04.925 --> 07:07.792
This is such a relief.
Thanks to this transformation device,

07:08.011 --> 07:11.674
I don't have to worry about being late. Hmm?

07:11.890 --> 07:13.596
Isn't that...?

07:13.809 --> 07:15.174
Great Saiyaman?

07:15.393 --> 07:20.808
lt's Videl! I can't head to school
like this. I've got no choice.

07:30.075 --> 07:31.565
You're not getting away from me.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.741
What do you think you're doing, Videl-san?

07:33.954 --> 07:36.536
Chasing me like I'm some kind of criminal...

07:58.854 --> 08:01.516
Today's the day when | find out who you are!

08:14.494 --> 08:15.995
H-Huh...?

08:22.043 --> 08:27.037
--Ah! It's the Great Saiyaman!
--We got pretty far away from the school
playing follow-the-leader.

08:27.257 --> 08:29.589
l have to hurry, or I'll be late--

08:37.308 --> 08:39.095
Morning.

08:39.311 --> 08:43.099
Good morning, Videl-san.
I'm impressed you found me.

08:43.315 --> 08:44.600
You wear something as flashy as that,

08:44.816 --> 08:47.057
and I'll spot you right away.

08:47.277 --> 08:49.734
Say, just who exactly are you?

08:49.946 --> 08:53.939
Oh, uh, well, like I told you before...

08:54.159 --> 08:58.949
I am the champion ofjustice,
who will not tolerate evil...

09:00.957 --> 09:02.697
Great Saiyaman!

09:02.918 --> 09:03.953
Stop messing around.

09:04.169 --> 09:07.002
No, I'm not messing around with you.

09:07.214 --> 09:11.958
You may look lame, but you can fly,
and your strength is remarkable.

09:12.177 --> 09:15.544
| find it hard to believe
you're a regular person.

09:15.764 --> 09:18.426
For us to live normally
with the people around us,

09:18.642 --> 09:21.850
there will be problems if they
find out how strong we are.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.643
Is it a secret, no matter what?

09:23.855 --> 09:25.937
Y-Yeah, no matter what.

09:26.149 --> 09:29.312
When you say that, it just makes
me want to find out even more.

09:38.286 --> 09:39.366
Hey, you!

09:39.579 --> 09:41.080
I'm sorry.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.490
What are you doing?! What are you up to?!

09:49.547 --> 09:52.209
Forgive me, but I'll just leave this here.

09:52.425 --> 09:56.168
Okay, see you at--er, no,
what I mean is, farewell!

09:59.683 --> 10:02.550
I swear, I'm going to find out who you are.

10:04.354 --> 10:06.766
Oh, man, I'm going to be tardy!

10:19.577 --> 10:21.283
Teacher, I'm sorry I'm late.

10:21.496 --> 10:27.036
Oh, Videl-kun, it's all right.
You are always such a busy person.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.459
Now, hurry up and take your seat.

10:29.671 --> 10:31.707
Right.

10:31.923 --> 10:34.630
Was there some early-morning
incident or something?

10:34.843 --> 10:37.129
M-Mm-hmm, you might say.

10:39.431 --> 10:41.387
Well, there's not much
you can do about it, Videl,

10:41.599 --> 10:43.885
but it's unusual for Gohan to be tardy.

10:44.102 --> 10:45.808
Huh? Gohan-kun, too?

10:46.021 --> 10:47.261
He just barely got here.

10:47.480 --> 10:50.392
Yeah, I overslept a little.

10:51.901 --> 10:56.110
Come to think of it, the Great Saiyaman
seemed to be heading toward the school...

10:58.450 --> 11:00.156
Very fishy.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.538
Come on, come on! What's your problem?!

11:21.639 --> 11:26.349
Sheesh. Chief, the cops in
Satan City are no big deal.

11:26.561 --> 11:31.726
Yeah. Once the boss takes over,
they'll be powerless to stop him.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.398
Let's go report this to the boss, right away.

11:36.279 --> 11:39.362
Hey, you two fellows,
reckless driving is wrong.

11:39.574 --> 11:42.111
Huh? Who do you think you are?

11:42.327 --> 11:45.239
Chief, this guy's a high-schooler.

11:45.455 --> 11:47.195
You've got a big mouth for a little kid.

11:47.415 --> 11:52.000
You mess with the almighty
Red Shark Gang, and you're gonna pay.

11:53.421 --> 11:54.797
Gohan-kun!

11:55.006 --> 11:56.462
Violence is wrong.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.175
Shut up!

11:59.886 --> 12:01.751
You leave me no choice.

12:04.182 --> 12:05.672
Videl-san!

12:08.103 --> 12:09.593
Oh, no!

12:11.856 --> 12:13.892
Chief!

12:14.109 --> 12:15.815
Th-That's...!

12:16.027 --> 12:19.269
Damn it! I won't forget this!

12:20.740 --> 12:21.525
Gohan-kun!

12:21.741 --> 12:22.981
Are you all right?

12:23.201 --> 12:24.316
You big dumbass!

12:24.536 --> 12:26.492
Yeah, I'm quite all right.

12:26.704 --> 12:27.614
Huh?

12:27.831 --> 12:30.493
It looked like you took a
powerful punch right in the face.

12:30.708 --> 12:34.997
Oh, that? I don't think that man
was particularly strong.

12:36.923 --> 12:38.208
I'm sorry, Gohan-kun.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.666
I thought that if you were the Great Saiyaman,

12:40.885 --> 12:43.547
you could take those two guys on easily,

12:43.763 --> 12:45.264
so I just stood back and watched.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.429
Huh? Me?

12:47.642 --> 12:50.850
I had the wrong idea.
If I'd been just a little bit later,

12:51.062 --> 12:54.304
I would have let you get
into some serious trouble.

12:54.524 --> 12:56.810
But I'm really glad you weren't hurt.

12:57.026 --> 12:58.857
Oh, yes.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.571
Ah, that one was close!

13:00.780 --> 13:03.863
l was that close to giving
myself away to Videl-san!

13:04.951 --> 13:08.910
Chief, that girl was Mister Satan's daughter.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.704
The stories about her being
pretty strong are true, huh?

13:11.916 --> 13:14.953
It's true, that girl's kick hit me hard,

13:15.170 --> 13:18.662
but even worse is this hand
that I hit the kid with.

13:18.882 --> 13:21.794
It feels like I cracked a bone.

13:22.010 --> 13:25.844
Damn, what a hard face that punk has!

13:42.155 --> 13:46.364
So then, you know what?
We went to the shop we always go to.

13:46.576 --> 13:49.409
And when we got there, those boys said...

13:51.164 --> 13:53.120
Yes, this is Videl.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.574
Bad news! A group calling
themselves the Red Shark Gang

13:55.793 --> 13:57.875
has taken Satan City's mayor hostage!

14:05.595 --> 14:08.462
You guys hurry up and bring Mister Satan here!

14:08.681 --> 14:10.967
Otherwise, the mayor's dead!

14:11.184 --> 14:15.177
J-Just what do you people
want with Mister Satan?

14:15.396 --> 14:18.763
Heh, our boss is here to
challenge him to a duel.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.690
What? A duel?

14:21.903 --> 14:24.360
Ha! That lousy Mister Satan!

14:24.572 --> 14:27.405
I don't care if he is the hero
that saved the Earth--

14:27.617 --> 14:30.950
he's not going to get away
with being a big shot forever.

14:31.162 --> 14:35.701
l, the great Rock-sama, am gonna kill him!

14:35.917 --> 14:40.911
After that, Boss, this city will belong
to the Red Shark Gang, huh?

14:41.130 --> 14:44.338
I think I'll change its name to Rock City.

14:44.551 --> 14:46.633
Right, Mr. Mayor?

14:48.680 --> 14:50.545
Unless you want to let your mayor get killed,

14:50.765 --> 14:53.006
you'll bring Satan here right now!

14:56.729 --> 14:57.935
Where's Mister Satan?

14:58.147 --> 15:00.183
We have been calling him for some time,

15:00.400 --> 15:02.436
but he appears not to be home,
so we can't reach him.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.490
For Pete's sake, once you get famous,

15:19.711 --> 15:22.748
these hare-brained idiots
come out of the woodwork.

15:22.964 --> 15:26.001
I'd like to dash out there and pound him good,

15:26.217 --> 15:28.594
but those guys are packing firearms.

15:28.803 --> 15:32.716
As a hero, it's also my duty
to avoid this kind of danger.

15:32.932 --> 15:35.924
I hate to say it, but I've got
no choice but to restrain myself.

15:36.144 --> 15:39.557
You keep dawdling around,
and we'll kill all you, too!

15:39.772 --> 15:41.353
Teacher, I'll be back in a bit!

15:41.566 --> 15:43.852
That's our girl. Be careful.

15:44.068 --> 15:45.478
--Teacher!
--Yes?

15:45.695 --> 15:48.858
E-Excuse me, but may I use the restroom?

15:49.073 --> 15:50.483
Hmph, again?

15:50.700 --> 15:53.362
Son-kun, you've asked that
several times before

15:53.578 --> 15:55.694
and then left, never to return, haven't you?

15:55.913 --> 16:00.031
I don't care if you do get top grades,
I'm not having it today.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.410
Oh, poor Gohan-kun.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.477
Is that him?

16:20.563 --> 16:23.270
You guys let the mayor go!

16:23.483 --> 16:26.646
Boss, that's Mister Satan's daughter.

16:26.861 --> 16:30.445
Ho, I hear you're pretty good.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.069
But I have no business with the daughter.

16:33.284 --> 16:36.902
I'm here to beat Mister Satan himself, after all.

16:37.121 --> 16:39.498
Every once in a while,
there are people like you

16:39.707 --> 16:42.870
who want to beat up Papa
and make a name for themselves.

16:43.086 --> 16:45.748
But Papa is a busy man, so in these cases,

16:45.963 --> 16:48.295
| get to take them on.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.623
What?

16:49.842 --> 16:55.462
l-lt's true. Videl-san is strong
enough to rival Mister Satan.

16:56.099 --> 16:59.432
Ho, so in other words, if I defeat this little girl,

16:59.644 --> 17:03.057
it's the same as if I'd
defeated Mister Satan, right?

17:03.272 --> 17:06.309
All right, then, that's another story.

17:06.526 --> 17:08.232
Still, you're pretty cute,

17:08.444 --> 17:10.776
being that you're his daughter, aren't you?

17:10.988 --> 17:13.525
Still, I won't hold back.

17:17.912 --> 17:20.528
You seem a little stronger than
the others up until now, huh?

17:20.748 --> 17:24.286
I'm gonna mangle that cute face of yours!

17:24.502 --> 17:28.244
The other guy's Ki is incredible.
Videl-san is in trouble.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.627
But how am I going to
get out of the classroom?

17:31.843 --> 17:34.630
Sister poet dear, brother poet, too.

17:34.846 --> 17:37.679
Wanna be with you 'cause
I need to spend my body.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.007
I'm a music-making man,
and no peace can be released in life...

17:41.227 --> 17:43.138
Hmm, what do I do?

17:43.354 --> 17:45.345
Isn't there some way out?

17:45.565 --> 17:49.057
...like this amplifier can.
Your boy is doing fine,

17:49.277 --> 17:52.861
and the energy you gave him
keeps him trying to unwind.

17:53.072 --> 17:56.280
'Cause I sing a natural rhythm,
play a magnetic chord.

17:56.492 --> 18:01.862
The summer sun is high in the sky,
and love that's in everyone's eye...

18:02.081 --> 18:04.197
Gah! An earthquake!

18:06.919 --> 18:10.286
Okay, everyone, take shelter under your desks!

18:14.302 --> 18:16.384
Now!

18:16.596 --> 18:18.086
Transform!

18:29.150 --> 18:32.358
Heh, you're pretty good, aren't you?

18:38.868 --> 18:41.109
Videl-san!

18:41.329 --> 18:43.411
That was cowardly, you guys!

18:44.665 --> 18:46.371
Who are you?!

18:51.422 --> 18:52.923
lam...

18:54.008 --> 18:58.968
...the champion of justice...
who will never tolerate evil...

18:59.180 --> 19:01.796
--...known to others as--
--Great Saiyaman!

19:03.059 --> 19:05.721
Videl-san, that's my line.

19:05.937 --> 19:10.351
Hey, you! This is my job, so stay out of my way!

19:10.566 --> 19:12.477
No one ever called you here!

19:12.693 --> 19:14.775
A-Aw, man...

19:17.448 --> 19:19.439
What are they doing?

19:19.659 --> 19:21.900
Look, just go somewhere else!

19:22.119 --> 19:25.156
Videl-san, you sure are demanding.

19:25.373 --> 19:26.488
Shut up!

19:26.707 --> 19:29.915
Hey, take care of the goofy-looking dude, too!

19:30.127 --> 19:31.628
Right!

19:35.424 --> 19:36.925
Why, you...!

19:40.054 --> 19:41.635
Are you all right, Mr. Mayor?

19:41.848 --> 19:43.839
Yeah, thank you.

19:44.058 --> 19:45.559
Die!

20:04.453 --> 20:06.284
You little bitch!

20:10.501 --> 20:12.002
Videl-san!

20:19.260 --> 20:21.797
I'm surprised! She really is pretty strong!

20:22.013 --> 20:24.550
She may even be stronger than Mister Satan!

20:25.683 --> 20:26.923
Hurry up and walk.

20:27.143 --> 20:28.633
Come on!

20:30.730 --> 20:31.810
Well, Videl-san...

20:32.023 --> 20:33.513
Wait!

20:34.775 --> 20:35.764
Thank you.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.225
N-Nah...

20:37.445 --> 20:40.983
Now I'm even more curious who you really are.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.484
I'm sure I'll find out before too long.

20:44.952 --> 20:47.068
Well, good luck with that.

20:59.967 --> 21:01.923
Huh? Gohan-kun did?

21:02.136 --> 21:04.422
Right after you left, there was
a big to-do about the earthquake,

21:04.639 --> 21:07.005
and during that, he disappeared.

21:07.224 --> 21:10.136
He came back just a short
while before you did, Videl.

21:10.353 --> 21:12.935
I knew it! Gohan-kun!

21:14.148 --> 21:16.764
He was behind us just a second ago...

21:18.486 --> 21:21.944
The guy's an absolute master of escape.

21:22.156 --> 21:25.489
Once again today, the Great
Saiyaman has been very busy.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.363
But no matter how invincible a hero may be,

21:28.579 --> 21:30.956
Gohan is realizing that
there are still some opponents

21:31.165 --> 21:34.373
who are difficult to deal with.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.271
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:43.487 --> 22:45.773
Kidnapping a monster's baby,
and putting it on display?

22:45.990 --> 22:47.651
There sure are some awful
people out there, huh?

22:47.867 --> 22:50.074
The Great Saiyaman, stealing a monster?

22:50.286 --> 22:51.776
Are you sure you're a champion ofjustice?

22:51.996 --> 22:53.702
Please wait a moment, Videl-san.

22:53.914 --> 22:56.656
This is no time for us to be fighting.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.537
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:58.753 --> 23:02.291
"A Monster is Spirited Away!
The Culprit is Great Saiyaman?!"

23:02.506 --> 23:05.839
Please believe me! I'm not a thief!
