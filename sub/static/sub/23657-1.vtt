<i>(lighter clicks)</i>

00:49.198 --> 00:50.573
And the rabbit?

00:52.064 --> 00:53.391
We found him.

00:57.984 --> 01:00.521
I didn't know it was lost again.

01:00.713 --> 01:02.703
Yeah, it was hopping around
in the woods.

01:03.817 --> 01:05.891
You shouldn't keep him in the closet.

01:07.545 --> 01:08.660
<i>(Sniggers)</i>

01:08.907 --> 01:11.081
He's too horny and hungry to stay there.

01:11.775 --> 01:13.185
Hmm.

01:16.082 --> 01:18.286
Good.

- Goodbye, Laaksonen.
- Goodbye.

Touko Laaksonen. Touko.

06:33.443 --> 06:34.391
Thank you.

06:36.096 --> 06:40.256
Do you have dreams, Touko?

06:41.903 --> 06:43.308
I don't know about that.

06:43.495 --> 06:45.871
What would you like to do
when the war is over'?

06:47.692 --> 06:51.188
I mean, besides
taking walks in the park.

06:55.317 --> 06:56.598
Play the piano.

06:59.567 --> 07:02.020
- And draw.
- An artist.

07:02.622 --> 07:05.906
- Well...
- Louvre.

07:05.960 --> 07:09.704
Laaksonen among the great masters there?

07:09.735 --> 07:11.350
<i>(they laugh)</i>

07:14.317 --> 07:17.400
No one from my hometown
has even been to Paris.

07:17.421 --> 07:20.621
You'll have a big opening pally.
You'll invite me.

07:20.829 --> 07:23.127
I'll tell everyone I know you.

07:23.148 --> 07:25.560
You have to have dreams in life.

07:30.983 --> 07:35.524
The Eastern Front is breaking down.
We'll be transferred there.

07:35.545 --> 07:39.847
There are too many Russians.
Way too many.

07:39.983 --> 07:41.559
<i>(distant explosions rumble)</i>

07:51.026 --> 07:56.230
I'll tell the boys
they have to have dreams...

07:57.115 --> 07:58.858
...and think about winning.

08:02.358 --> 08:03.389
Well...

08:07.983 --> 08:10.899
Sir. Heikki.

08:12.079 --> 08:13.140
Huh!

08:14.524 --> 08:16.349
You can keep it.

08:25.733 --> 08:27.475

08:38.839 --> 08:40.974
- Good morning.
- Morning.

08:41.292 --> 08:43.091
I talked to my boss.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.910
He promised you can give it a try
at our company.

08:47.066 --> 08:50.230
- How come?
- I showed him your work.

08:50.888 --> 08:53.180
That landscape you painted for Dad.

08:54.482 --> 08:56.986
Your boss will change his mind
when he sees me.

08:57.185 --> 08:59.955
C'mon. We need money.

09:01.024 --> 09:04.520
Your veteran discount
isn't helping that much.

09:04.737 --> 09:08.014
Do you even know how much
cheese costs on the black market?

09:14.024 --> 09:17.887
Alrighty. You're feeling better, huh?

09:20.148 --> 09:23.229
- You're looking like yourself again.
- Am I?

09:23.346 --> 09:27.351
Well, at least you vaguely resemble
my brother.

09:35.190 --> 09:36.470
<i>(Sighs)</i>

09:36.607 --> 09:40.470
- I got a straight line.
- What straight line?

09:41.640 --> 09:43.906
I marked the obituaries
of all my friends

09:43.940 --> 09:45.895
who said they'd quit smoking.

09:46.023 --> 09:49.057
Born in 1921, 1922, 1923, 1924, 1925.

09:56.356 --> 09:58.513
Brother, dear, the war is over.

10:22.522 --> 10:23.850
<i>(urinates)</i>

10:26.241 --> 10:27.320
Huh!

10:29.022 --> 10:31.429
<i>(sound of aeropiane in distance)</i>

11:03.689 --> 11:05.395
Damn it, a Russky.

<i>(knocks at door)</i>

12:55.520 --> 12:57.808
Touko. Touko.

12:57.851 --> 12:58.854
Shh.

12:58.954 --> 13:02.018
I'm here. Everything OK.

13:02.145 --> 13:04.302
Everything's OK.

13:05.062 --> 13:06.768
Everything's OK.

13:06.895 --> 13:09.929
Everything's OK. Everything's OK.

13:11.270 --> 13:12.810
Why wouldn't everything be OK?

13:15.499 --> 13:16.874
<i>(she sighs)</i>

13:18.645 --> 13:20.304
Give it to me.

13:38.331 --> 13:40.868
You have to find someone
you can share your life with.

13:42.904 --> 13:47.147
Someone who'll look after you.
Someone special.

13:52.228 --> 13:54.100
I had someone in the war.

13:56.186 --> 13:58.971
Wow. What happened?

14:02.561 --> 14:05.014
Well, what usually happens in war.

14:05.144 --> 14:09.138
- From the women's auxiliary corps?
- No.

14:29.044 --> 14:30.455
You're totally confused.

14:33.477 --> 14:36.820
It's the war. It made you like that.
But it'll pass.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.120
You just have to work and meet people.

14:39.276 --> 14:42.338
A lot of girls would want
a handsome officer like you.

14:42.628 --> 14:48.011
You got that medal
because you fought bravely, right?

14:52.102 --> 14:56.095
- I guess so.
- Pull yourself together. Enjoy life.

14:57.143 --> 14:58.423
Good night.

14:59.958 --> 15:01.534
Good night.

18:05.140 --> 18:07.380
He's a faggot!

18:08.015 --> 18:11.927
Get out or I'll call the police!

18:12.974 --> 18:14.680
You need to know how to behave here.

18:15.169 --> 18:18.437
I'll ban you for a month. Minimum.

18:20.348 --> 18:22.553
Ban me for life while you're at it.

18:26.980 --> 18:28.350
Thanks, honey.

20:22.124 --> 20:25.489
- What's your name?
- Nipa.

20:26.919 --> 20:31.494
- You want to see something?
- I'd rather do something.

20:38.846 --> 20:41.335
<i>(both laugh nervously)</i>

20:41.572 --> 20:42.852
Wow.

20:44.263 --> 20:46.171
May I keep this?

21:04.361 --> 21:07.012

- Police!

21:07.046 --> 21:10.045

21:18.319 --> 21:21.649
You, over there! Stop.

21:23.512 --> 21:26.428
Police! I got one of them.

21:26.554 --> 21:30.168
- Stay where you are.
- Police!

- Good evening. What's happening?

23:08.886 --> 23:11.173
We're clearing the park of criminals.

23:13.440 --> 23:16.935
- Why do you have to do that?
- For the Olympics.

23:17.636 --> 23:23.088
Are you interested
in javelin, pole-vaulting,

23:23.365 --> 23:28.857
-or perhaps wrestling?
- Javelin.

23:28.904 --> 23:33.046
Good. Then hurry up
before the spear throwers are here.

23:35.344 --> 23:37.169
Yes, we'll do our best.

23:39.344 --> 23:41.631
- And your name is?
- Get in the car.

24:03.260 --> 24:04.125
Kake.

24:11.718 --> 24:13.591
<i>(laughs)</i>

24:29.343 --> 24:34.214
- Did you sleep well?
Fantastically. You?

24:35.128 --> 24:38.478
Fantastically.
- Great.

24:40.259 --> 24:41.800
All right, let's go.

24:49.634 --> 24:52.419
Laaksonen,
I can't take this to a client.

24:52.551 --> 24:54.210
Do something.

25:06.301 --> 25:07.758
Excuse me.

25:07.884 --> 25:11.297
Can you come with me?
It'll take just a moment.

25:17.425 --> 25:19.832
Please sit on the couch.

25:21.592 --> 25:23.749
Maria, could you come here for a moment?

25:29.467 --> 25:31.292
A moment, please.

25:34.800 --> 25:36.459
Uh...

25:38.050 --> 25:43.716
Make eye contact.
No, not with me. With Maria.

25:45.300 --> 25:51.131
Good. Pretend it's morning.

25:51.841 --> 25:56.960
The first morning
after you've been... intimate.

25:57.073 --> 25:58.483
Um...

25:59.691 --> 26:01.320
Think about naughty things.

26:01.508 --> 26:03.712
<i>(they giggle)</i>

26:04.635 --> 26:09.790
That's it. Think about
what it feels like to touch each other.

26:10.716 --> 26:15.421
That's it.
Gabriel, think a little harder.

26:15.549 --> 26:17.090
<i>(they giggle)</i>

26:18.049 --> 26:20.835
Touch her in a way that shows
the electricity between you.

26:25.341 --> 26:26.538
Good.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.292
- Guess what?
- What?

26:34.424 --> 26:38.543
- The boss said he's happy with you.
- That's great.

26:38.668 --> 26:41.507
- What are you doing?
- Working. Working.

26:41.632 --> 26:45.622
I'm promoting the consumption
of useless things by unethical means.

26:45.642 --> 26:47.683
Ha-ha. Let me see.

26:47.841 --> 26:52.167
- No.
- Are you afraid I will laugh at you?

26:53.181 --> 26:55.402
- No, no, no.
- I promise.

26:57.549 --> 26:59.457
- Well?
- No, no.

26:59.590 --> 27:01.297
What?

27:02.424 --> 27:04.462
Sit down.

27:05.090 --> 27:07.212
Sit!

27:13.465 --> 27:15.290
No.

27:16.215 --> 27:19.358

- No, I don't.

27:19.412 --> 27:21.296
- Yes, you do.
- Hmm.

- I don't look like that.
- I think you do.

27:46.751 --> 27:49.074
- I'm not that beautiful.
- Yes, you are.

27:49.208 --> 27:50.702
Those legs.

27:51.185 --> 27:55.656
You never learned how to draw legs.
Those look like sticks.

27:55.923 --> 27:59.537
Let me show you how.
Give me that block.

28:01.396 --> 28:03.553
Well?

- You're welcome.

- You're unbelievably good.
- No, I'm not.

28:36.422 --> 28:38.129
Yes, you are.

28:40.397 --> 28:42.222
I've been thinking that...

28:44.214 --> 28:49.098
...some day I might like
to have my own exhibition.

28:49.464 --> 28:53.706
- Why some day'? Why not tomorrow'?
- No.

28:54.464 --> 28:56.143
How can you be an artist

28:56.205 --> 29:00.080
-if nobody sees your work?
- Nobody wants to see it.

29:00.143 --> 29:02.285

You won't even show yours to me.

Countryside landscapes.

Well, I'm not so interested
in country...

33:15.043 --> 33:20.033

35:04.625 --> 35:08.488
<i>(in German then English)
Are you leaving?</i>

35:09.918 --> 35:11.293
(in English) Yes.

35:11.583 --> 35:14.368
Sir, you need to pay for your room.

35:14.499 --> 35:18.806
Yes, I'll arrange and come back and pay.

35:18.827 --> 35:22.041
No, no, you have to pay first,
or I will call the police.

35:40.124 --> 35:42.743
(in Finnish)
Name three streets that intersect

35:42.874 --> 35:45.280
with Runeberginkatu Street in Helsinki.

35:46.666 --> 35:51.785
Apollonkatu, Hesperiankatu
and Topeliuksenkatu Street.

35:52.629 --> 35:56.630
You grew up in Kaarina.
Why don't you speak the dialect?

35:57.303 --> 36:00.668
My parents were teachers.
This is how we spoke at home.

36:02.874 --> 36:05.789
Why did you have a strange man
in your hotel room?

36:06.749 --> 36:11.759
A man, you say, stole
your passport and wallet.

36:15.665 --> 36:18.616
We talked about pheasant hunting.

36:21.521 --> 36:22.932
Is this yours?

36:25.763 --> 36:27.470
It was found in your room.

36:29.082 --> 36:33.206
Well, I'll return to Finland.

36:34.165 --> 36:40.955
Based on your answers,
I can't confirm you're Finnish.

36:42.456 --> 36:46.036
In German eyes,
you're either a spy or a criminal.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.494
But I know what you are.

36:55.290 --> 36:58.122
I'll report to Consul Alijoki

36:58.248 --> 37:01.300
that the man arrested
by the German police is not Finnish.

37:01.339 --> 37:05.872
I'll let these gentlemen
interrogate you. That's it.

37:08.706 --> 37:09.702
Heikki.

37:11.331 --> 37:14.033
- What?
- Heikki Tapio Alijoki.

37:14.067 --> 37:17.075
Captain Heikki Alijoki.

37:17.096 --> 37:20.370
From the Helsinki Coastal Artillery,
during the war.

37:21.623 --> 37:23.780
- What about him?
- I know him.

37:24.289 --> 37:27.121
- May I speak to him?
- About what?

37:28.914 --> 37:30.573
Pheasant hunting.

37:41.747 --> 37:43.904
<i>(in English) You know...</i>

37:45.039 --> 37:48.404
We used to put scum like you
into concentration camps

37:48.539 --> 37:50.447
and gas them to death.

38:00.289 --> 38:01.829
<i>(door opens)</i>

38:07.830 --> 38:11.907
-(In Finnish) Do you know this man'?
- No.

38:12.038 --> 38:14.326
I'm Lieutenant Laaksonen.

38:14.872 --> 38:18.367
We fought together
in Téhtitorninméki Hill Park.

38:18.497 --> 38:23.451
We had a number of close calls.

38:23.580 --> 38:26.365
There were no battles
in Téhtitorninmäki Hill Park.

38:26.557 --> 38:30.203
I meant the air battles over Helsinki.

38:31.163 --> 38:35.820
We served together. I served under you.

38:43.413 --> 38:45.119
I see. I see.

38:45.246 --> 38:49.193
(in German)
Can we speak in private for a moment?

38:50.746 --> 38:52.489
Of course.

39:10.163 --> 39:12.367
(in Finnish) is this some trap?

39:13.556 --> 39:18.486
- Are you trying to trap me?
- I'm the one who's trapped.

39:18.621 --> 39:22.070
- How did you know I was here?
- I didn't.

39:22.204 --> 39:24.112
Your name was mentioned.

39:25.872 --> 39:27.283
I see. I see.

39:28.537 --> 39:32.235
- We know each other. We're both--
- You can't say it.

39:32.316 --> 39:33.773
We're both officers.

39:34.555 --> 39:37.920
This is ridiculous.
Much ado about nothing.

39:39.204 --> 39:43.343
You're asking for trouble
with pictures like these.

39:44.412 --> 39:46.071
It's just a piece of paper.

39:46.204 --> 39:48.361
A dirty picture someone drew for fun.

39:49.079 --> 39:51.034
It's not just a piece of paper.

39:51.162 --> 39:54.611
It's an atomic bomb.
You could go to prison for that.

39:54.745 --> 39:57.862
The police will search your house

39:57.995 --> 40:00.994
and interrogate your family
and colleagues.

40:03.953 --> 40:08.824
I don't care what happens to me,
but my family...

40:11.078 --> 40:13.236
- Can you help me?
- No.

40:22.786 --> 40:28.285
How about you swear
on your officer's honour

40:28.411 --> 40:31.327
that you've never done
anything dishonourable?

40:35.620 --> 40:37.113
<i>(in German) Gentlemen.</i>

40:40.119 --> 40:45.074
Laaksonen is a Finnish officer.

40:46.578 --> 40:48.486
He would like to say something.

40:55.630 --> 40:59.993
Yes. I would like to thank you.

41:00.119 --> 41:01.197
And?

41:04.369 --> 41:06.822
I haven't done anything wrong.

41:12.411 --> 41:15.943
We always want to help Finland.

41:17.452 --> 41:19.989
I consider this case closed.

41:21.632 --> 41:23.652
Thank you.

41:23.785 --> 41:26.985
(in Finnish) Mr Laaksonen,
my wife and I'd like to invite you

41:27.119 --> 41:30.034
over for dinner in Helsinki some day.

41:36.369 --> 41:38.691
- You're married?
- Of course I am.

41:39.494 --> 41:43.535
But I do sometimes invite
special friends over to play poker...

41:44.910 --> 41:46.653
...when I'm in Helsinki.

41:49.868 --> 41:52.239
You could join us.

41:55.327 --> 41:57.566
But you have to keep quiet about it.

41:58.327 --> 42:02.273
- Artists are always welcome.
- Thank you.

42:02.410 --> 42:05.658
My wife is actually very understanding.

42:14.910 --> 42:16.486
Hi.

42:16.993 --> 42:20.442
Did you have a good time in Berlin?
Did you bring me a gift?

42:21.785 --> 42:24.238
The customs officials took it.

44:55.407 --> 44:59.319
- What are you wearing?
- I have a new hobby.

44:59.449 --> 45:03.230
- What?
- You told me to have fun and live.

45:05.042 --> 45:06.360
Hmm...

45:07.490 --> 45:10.856
Our new tenant is coming over.

45:10.990 --> 45:12.701
A religious girl from the countryside?

45:12.722 --> 45:13.670
Hmm...

45:16.699 --> 45:18.192
<i>(both laugh)</i>

45:20.698 --> 45:24.064
You don't have to stand up.
Touko Laaksonen, Kaija's brother.

45:24.704 --> 45:28.563
Veli. My name is Veli Mäkinen.

45:28.698 --> 45:30.239
You may also call me Nipa.

45:30.365 --> 45:32.605
You have a beautiful apartment.

45:32.740 --> 45:36.542
- Where did you find this?
- Our landlady is a war widow.

45:36.563 --> 45:40.817
- We've met before.
- You're mistaken.

45:45.803 --> 45:49.660
- Would you like to see your room?
- Yes. Please.

45:56.490 --> 45:58.480
<i>(hums tune)</i>

48:31.013 --> 48:37.543
- Touko. You're here too?
- Yes. I like dancing.

48:37.820 --> 48:42.146
- You like dancing?
- Yes. I have a season ticket.

48:46.278 --> 48:51.947
- Don't you have a deadline tomorrow'?
- I finished the campaign already.

48:52.145 --> 48:54.062
Oh. What's the slogan?

48:54.195 --> 48:56.945
"Yum-yum, chocolate is delicious."

48:57.070 --> 49:00.151
- It doesn't sound like you finished it.
- Well...

49:00.278 --> 49:02.767
- Could you get us some champagne?
- Sure.

49:03.820 --> 49:06.887
- Would you like a glass?
- Yes, please.

49:06.908 --> 49:09.435
Your solo. I have to...

49:09.570 --> 49:11.443
I forgot my wallet at home.

49:11.570 --> 49:16.236
- How did you pay for the ticket?
- The season ticket!

49:16.332 --> 49:19.497
Can you go get the champagne?
I'll pay you back.

49:21.070 --> 49:23.393
- Sure.
- Thank you.

49:34.278 --> 49:39.481
- We've met.
-If we have, I was drunk.

49:43.900 --> 49:46.066
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

49:46.153 --> 49:50.100
- Thank you for inviting me here.
- Thank you for coming.

49:50.236 --> 49:52.808
- Cheers.
{both} Cheers.

49:52.829 --> 49:57.566
My own projects rarely materialise.
Take my writings, for example.

49:57.694 --> 50:00.729
All the publishers
refused to publish them.

50:00.861 --> 50:04.109
- Finland is not ready.
- You know how it is in this country.

50:04.163 --> 50:08.277
Jalle said to me it's a great thing
to be a good ad man.

50:08.402 --> 50:12.444
And I am. And you, Touko,
also are a good ad man.

50:12.569 --> 50:14.275
That's why you're our art director.

50:14.402 --> 50:17.483
- Congratulations. I almost forgot.
- Thanks.

50:19.069 --> 50:22.068
- Oh, you're interested in motorcycles?
- Yes.

50:22.194 --> 50:24.481
I wish I could ride one like that.

50:24.610 --> 50:28.308
- It would be great to go for a ride.
- Oh, yes.

50:30.654 --> 50:33.480
Gentlemen, why don't we take a photo'?

50:33.610 --> 50:35.353
- Work the camera.
- Grab the handle.

50:35.485 --> 50:37.310
- Here?
- Yes.

50:37.444 --> 50:39.565
Imagine it's the source of power.

50:54.235 --> 50:55.692
Touko, join us!

50:56.818 --> 51:00.481
- It's a children's game.
- In God's eyes, we are all children.

51:00.610 --> 51:04.308
- C'mon, Touko.
- Touko, Touko, Touko!

51:12.318 --> 51:15.150
- Are you a virgin?
- No.

51:15.276 --> 51:16.672
<i>(laughter)</i>

51:16.693 --> 51:19.775
Touko. Truth or dare?

51:20.568 --> 51:23.685
- Choose truth.
- Truth.

51:25.318 --> 51:26.942
Dare.

51:28.193 --> 51:30.231
Kiss Heidi.

51:33.359 --> 51:36.227
Kiss her!

51:36.359 --> 51:39.855
<i>(all) Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!</i>

51:48.234 --> 51:49.977
<i>(laughter and cheering)</i>

51:52.859 --> 51:54.933
All right, I think it's my turn.

51:55.067 --> 51:58.267
Whoa. It's pointing at Kaija.

51:58.299 --> 52:00.088
Truth or dare?

52:00.963 --> 52:04.364
- Truth.
- That is, dare. Uh...

52:05.401 --> 52:08.565
- Kiss Heidi.
- Dear Touko, it's illegal.

52:10.929 --> 52:12.588
C'mon, go ahead.

52:24.317 --> 52:25.692
<i>(laughter)</i>

52:25.817 --> 52:27.523
Almost, Kaija. Almost.

52:29.053 --> 52:32.308
During the war,
there were blackouts in Helsinki.

52:32.442 --> 52:35.938
You might be too young
to remember that.

52:36.067 --> 52:38.141
There was electricity in the air.

52:38.275 --> 52:41.807
Bombers flew over the city.
People met strangers.

52:41.942 --> 52:47.310
It was so dark, we had to grope
each other to find out who was who.

52:47.442 --> 52:48.233
<i>(motor whirrs)</i>

52:48.233 --> 52:49.146

- Hi, Dad.
- My son.

53:13.894 --> 53:15.601
- Hi.
- Lovely to see you.

53:15.733 --> 53:18.221
- Welcome.
- Nipa. Thank you.

53:18.358 --> 53:19.852
Welcome.

53:20.608 --> 53:24.732
Where's my godson, Aaro?
Have you eaten him?

53:35.274 --> 53:38.060
- What?
- Come!

53:43.646 --> 53:49.481
One, two, three, four,

53:49.607 --> 53:55.474
five, six, seven, eight,

53:55.607 --> 53:58.125

53:58.164 --> 53:59.975
Here I come!

54:04.982 --> 54:06.476
<i>(boy) I saw you!</i>

54:36.061 --> 54:37.845
I loved coming here as a child.

54:40.398 --> 54:42.188
What did you do here?

54:46.398 --> 54:47.974
I shined my boots.

55:42.856 --> 55:44.479
In the old days, people believed

55:44.606 --> 55:49.263
that if an unmarried woman rolled
in a hayfield on Midsummer Night,

55:49.397 --> 55:51.850
she'd see her future husband
on the surface of a pond.

55:53.397 --> 55:57.012
The hayfield on the island behind
us is a perfect place for that.

55:59.230 --> 56:01.849
How do the midsummer
love spells work'?

56:01.980 --> 56:06.022
On Midsummer Night, the
sun doesn't go down at all,

56:06.147 --> 56:11.184
so men can't hide.
Your dad tried to hide...

56:12.272 --> 56:15.555
I tried to hide?
Mom is pulling your leg.

57:48.062 --> 57:51.973
I would destroy everything.
Your family and...

57:52.033 --> 57:53.573
No, you wouldn't.

57:57.145 --> 58:01.685
- I'm evil. I'm ruined.
- No, you're not.

Everyone should see your drawings.

- Poker.

Shit, it's the cops!

01:03:09.432 --> 01:03:12.845
Get out from the balcony.
Take all the stuff with you.

01:03:12.974 --> 01:03:16.506
- Heikki, let's go.
- No.

01:03:19.765 --> 01:03:22.551
I'll stay and hold them off. You go.

01:03:23.515 --> 01:03:25.886
- Go. Go.
- Police. Open the door!

01:03:28.682 --> 01:03:29.962

Hey! Not there. This way!

01:04:30.556 --> 01:04:32.594
We should throw parties like that.

01:04:32.722 --> 01:04:35.211
Kaija might find it hard to swallow.

01:04:35.931 --> 01:04:38.337
I'd like us to have an apartment
together.

01:04:38.472 --> 01:04:42.217
Big windows with light-yellow curtains.

01:04:43.222 --> 01:04:45.379
Only sissies like yellow.

01:04:46.222 --> 01:04:51.212
I'd like the curtains to be open
when we dance with friends.

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:55.130
- Where would we get the money for it?
- Sell your works.

01:04:55.264 --> 01:04:58.263
- Where?
Internationally.

01:04:58.988 --> 01:05:02.215
Internationally, maybe.
In Finland, never.

01:05:02.347 --> 01:05:06.009
- We'll get an apartment.
- And throw my little sister out?

01:05:06.139 --> 01:05:08.675
Yes, your little sister, who's only 30!

01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:11.243
Don't build castles in the air.

01:05:11.313 --> 01:05:14.215
I want you to hold my hand
in broad daylight.

01:05:14.347 --> 01:05:16.220
I want the curtains to be open.

01:05:16.347 --> 01:05:19.760
- Nice idea, but totally unrealistic.
- Wanna make a bet?

01:05:19.888 --> 01:05:21.879
- For a bottle of whisky.
- Deal

01:05:22.013 --> 01:05:26.802
- You practically lost already.
- You know what? You're a sissy.

01:05:27.805 --> 01:05:29.464
What?

01:05:29.597 --> 01:05:35.262
No wonder we lost the war with a faggot
like you running after the cannons.

01:05:38.221 --> 01:05:41.256
I'm tired of fighting.
I fought my battles.

01:05:41.388 --> 01:05:43.379
I'm no freedom fighter.

01:05:44.721 --> 01:05:50.173
Oh, you're just a cock artist
who wants to fuck and have fun!

01:05:50.305 --> 01:05:52.129
Only sissies like yellow.

01:06:21.762 --> 01:06:23.836
They almost didn't let me in.

01:06:25.096 --> 01:06:27.086
I told them I'm your brother.

01:06:30.429 --> 01:06:32.337
The treatment here is good.

01:06:37.387 --> 01:06:39.093
Great.

01:06:41.137 --> 01:06:43.590
I need help.

01:06:45.554 --> 01:06:49.252
You need help mixing gin and tonics.

01:06:49.387 --> 01:06:53.049
- I can help you with that.
- You can also be cured.

01:06:55.766 --> 01:07:01.442
Except that I'm not sick.
And you're not either.

01:07:01.637 --> 01:07:04.588
I'll be cured, and we'll have children.

Come with me. Let's get out of here.

01:07:18.130 --> 01:07:20.204
Did you hear we started a club?

01:07:21.386 --> 01:07:23.176
A motorcycle club.

01:07:24.261 --> 01:07:25.885
Without motorcycles.

01:07:31.095 --> 01:07:35.385
Touko. Thanks for coming.

01:07:36.428 --> 01:07:38.799
But I want to be cured.

01:07:40.428 --> 01:07:44.126
I lost my job. I don't want to lose
the rest of what I have.

01:07:44.261 --> 01:07:45.718
Heikki.

01:07:49.652 --> 01:07:51.146
Goodbye, my friend.

01:08:08.136 --> 01:08:09.676
Lieutenant.

01:08:15.511 --> 01:08:17.216
Captain.

01:08:41.469 --> 01:08:43.341
I saw the article.

01:08:44.426 --> 01:08:46.252
Poor Heikki.

01:08:50.301 --> 01:08:52.044
What can we do?

01:09:59.634 --> 01:10:03.047

- Thank you, Frank.

Tom...

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:22.838
This could be cover material.

01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:28.827
We need something more. For a cover
artist, we need something more.

Tom...

Yeah, Tom of Finland.
How do you like that, Frank'?

01:10:51.811 --> 01:10:53.300
Tom of Finland?

01:10:53.425 --> 01:10:55.415
Tom of Sweden would sell more.

01:10:56.466 --> 01:10:59.417
But it seems Finland has bigger cocks.

01:11:08.050 --> 01:11:10.456

Hi. What terrible weather again.

01:14:39.213 --> 01:14:40.754
You have mail from America.

01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:50.253
Your work is on the cover again.

01:14:51.632 --> 01:14:54.493
- There's also a letter from that Doug.
- Hmm.

Your number one fan...
What does he write?

01:14:57.588 --> 01:15:00.076
They want me to travel there.

01:15:00.213 --> 01:15:04.586
They want to have a small exhibition.
Or a couple of them.

He wants to help me.

You're two dirty little boys.
Should I clean here real quick?

01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:41.493
You should hire a cleaning lady.

- Are you having a party?
- You want a glass?

01:16:47.919 --> 01:16:52.080

- Life. The joy of living.

01:27:02.577 --> 01:27:04.283
(in Finnish) 16 marks, please.

01:27:05.035 --> 01:27:06.741
Thank you.

01:27:16.785 --> 01:27:18.112
Good evening.

01:27:42.576 --> 01:27:44.319
<i>(coughs)</i>

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:49.283
- You still have that cough?
- Yeah.

01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:15.699
- Kake made it to America.
- He sure did.

01:28:17.909 --> 01:28:23.242
- Were there beautiful guys in America?
- Yup.

01:28:26.284 --> 01:28:29.567
- The kind you always drew'? Your men'?
- Yes.

01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:32.189
- You had many?
- A couple.

01:28:33.867 --> 01:28:37.067
But none of them were

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:41.989
as smart and elegant and sexy

01:28:42.117 --> 01:28:45.151
as this one dancer I know.

01:28:45.283 --> 01:28:46.315
<i>(coughs)</i>

01:28:47.992 --> 01:28:52.069
- Did everybody sweet-talk like you?
- Yes.

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:53.740
<i>(laughs)</i>

01:29:01.450 --> 01:29:02.695
I'm ill.

01:29:08.200 --> 01:29:11.067
The world's best doctors
are in Los Angeles.

01:29:12.116 --> 01:29:15.446
For them,
throat cancer is like curing the flu.

01:29:16.158 --> 01:29:22.108
We could get a house with a garden.
We could have parrots.

01:29:24.033 --> 01:29:26.071
Parrots sound good.

01:29:27.033 --> 01:29:31.110
It's always warm there.
And the sea is sparkling blue.

01:29:31.241 --> 01:29:34.358
Almost everyone is like us
in California.

01:29:35.283 --> 01:29:39.276
Sometimes heteros
are bullied and harassed,

01:29:39.407 --> 01:29:43.354
and I have to intervene and say,
"They also have a right to exist

01:29:43.491 --> 01:29:46.193
and live their life
the way they want to."

01:29:47.074 --> 01:29:48.484
You're so noble.

01:29:53.282 --> 01:29:54.657
Why didn't you tell me?

01:29:57.449 --> 01:29:59.238
I didn't want you to see me dying.

01:29:59.366 --> 01:30:03.194
There's nothing I want to see more
than... I mean...

01:30:03.324 --> 01:30:05.563
<i>(coughs)</i>

01:30:05.699 --> 01:30:07.441
That's OK.

01:30:24.948 --> 01:30:27.271
<i>(Nipa coughs)</i>

01:30:30.407 --> 01:30:33.322
- Let's make you underwear with this.
- This?

01:30:34.032 --> 01:30:37.564
This might feel good.
At least you could see through it.

01:30:37.698 --> 01:30:39.192
<i>(Nipa laughs)</i>

01:30:51.698 --> 01:30:56.190
- Good evening.
- We'd like to have curtains made.

01:30:56.323 --> 01:30:58.066
How long?

01:30:59.615 --> 01:31:02.482
-2.70 metres?
-2.70 metres.

01:31:02.615 --> 01:31:04.238
2.70 metres.

01:31:05.073 --> 01:31:06.898
Only sissies like yellow.

01:31:07.031 --> 01:31:08.572
<i>(Nipa laughs)</i>

01:31:19.573 --> 01:31:21.563
Well, well.

01:31:21.698 --> 01:31:25.775
- You owe me a bottle of whisky.
- Oh.

01:31:27.072 --> 01:31:31.529
I owe you more than that.

01:31:31.656 --> 01:31:33.943
Do you want me to sew rings on these?

01:31:36.906 --> 01:31:40.189
- I do.
- You want these kinds of rings?

01:31:42.072 --> 01:31:43.945
I do.

01:31:53.822 --> 01:31:57.188
<i>(Nipa)
Make sure everyone knows we exist.</i>

01:31:57.322 --> 01:31:59.230
<i>Promise me?</i>

01:31:59.989 --> 01:32:01.565
<i>(Tom) 1 do.</i>

01:32:02.530 --> 01:32:04.355
<i>(Nip?!) Everyone.</i>

01:32:50.238 --> 01:32:51.732
<i>(buzzer)</i>

01:33:08.404 --> 01:33:11.900
- You've started using the elevator.
- Nonsense.

01:33:13.113 --> 01:33:15.317
Elevators are for old people.

01:33:19.112 --> 01:33:21.862
- How have you been?
- Great.

01:33:32.696 --> 01:33:34.853
I miss Nipa every day.

01:33:39.154 --> 01:33:41.062
All right.

01:33:41.570 --> 01:33:43.230
(Tom) Show me your new ones.

01:33:43.987 --> 01:33:47.317
I don't know if these are any good.

01:33:48.404 --> 01:33:50.063
You'll find out soon.

01:33:51.904 --> 01:33:53.480
Here.

01:34:03.153 --> 01:34:05.690
- You've made tremendous progress.
- Have I?

01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:07.361
You have.

01:34:08.070 --> 01:34:10.025
This is good.

01:34:12.278 --> 01:34:15.359
This is my favourite.

01:34:15.487 --> 01:34:18.319
- Have an exhibition.
- No.

01:34:19.112 --> 01:34:22.276
They're horrible. Nonsense.

01:34:23.986 --> 01:34:26.902
They are. Look at them.
You're just saying they're good.

01:34:27.028 --> 01:34:31.354
We never became real artists.
You and me.

01:34:32.778 --> 01:34:36.026
- We didn't?
Apparently not.

01:34:36.153 --> 01:34:40.775
Shall we clean here'?
You're not throwing this away, are you'?

01:34:44.028 --> 01:34:45.983
Nipa loved this book.

01:34:48.361 --> 01:34:50.316
I think it's my turn.

01:35:07.694 --> 01:35:09.437
I see.

01:35:31.360 --> 01:35:32.901
People appreciate me.

01:35:36.069 --> 01:35:39.482
- Where are you showing these?
- Around the world.

01:35:39.610 --> 01:35:41.850
- These dick drawings?
- People like them.

01:35:42.902 --> 01:35:44.016
Huh...

01:35:46.152 --> 01:35:47.609
Right.

01:35:51.610 --> 01:35:55.853
I'm glad you use that funny pseudonym,

01:35:55.985 --> 01:35:58.735
so that you don't stain
our family's reputation.

01:36:04.610 --> 01:36:07.146
Dirty, cheap sex magazines.

01:36:11.985 --> 01:36:13.940
Where's the vacuum cleaner?

01:36:16.068 --> 01:36:18.687
You could've signed
my exhibition guestbook.

01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:23.815
-(phone rings)
- Kaija, the phone.

01:36:23.943 --> 01:36:25.021
Uh-huh.

01:36:27.193 --> 01:36:28.899
Touko Laaksonen.

01:36:29.026 --> 01:36:30.732
Should I cook something for you?

01:36:32.359 --> 01:36:34.517
I'm on the phone.

01:36:34.651 --> 01:36:37.353
(in English) Sorry, can you wait?

01:36:38.776 --> 01:36:42.770
<i>(in Finnish)
You don't have to. I'll eat out.</i>

01:36:42.901 --> 01:36:44.560
They're calling from America.

<i>(in English) So, hello, Doug.</i>

01:37:02.442 --> 01:37:06.270
<i>How did she take it?
Did you show them?</i>

01:37:07.276 --> 01:37:09.812
I think she's trying
to poison me with her cooking.

01:37:10.942 --> 01:37:13.644
<i>Tom, we have a problem.</i>

01:37:13.775 --> 01:37:16.608
<i>They're blaming our people
for the virus.</i>

01:37:16.734 --> 01:37:18.358
Why?

01:37:18.484 --> 01:37:20.972
<i>Because our people are dying from it.</i>

01:37:21.109 --> 01:37:24.890
<i>And they think
your drawings are dangerous.</i>

01:37:25.025 --> 01:37:27.016
<i>We're not even getting printed.</i>

01:37:35.775 --> 01:37:37.814
<i>(in Finnish)
We're going to lose this war.</i>

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:41.190
We're going to die.

01:37:42.317 --> 01:37:43.644
Right, sir?

01:37:58.941 --> 01:38:00.565
Jalonen.

You're a tenor, right?

01:38:04.400 --> 01:38:06.225
Lahtinen, you're also a tenor, right?

01:38:10.275 --> 01:38:14.684

- Yes, sir.

<i>“if a man also lieth with mankind</i>

01:39:22.898 --> 01:39:25.056
<i>as he lieth with a woman,"</i>

<i>it says, “Even both of them
have committed an abomination.“</i>

<i>"They shall surely be put to death,

We're going to hell.
You wanna come along?

01:40:01.898 --> 01:40:04.648
Excuse me, where are you going?

01:40:04.773 --> 01:40:07.475
To see my friend, my brother...

01:40:07.606 --> 01:40:09.763
- His brother.
- My niece.

01:40:09.898 --> 01:40:11.972
- Our brother, together.
- Nephew.

01:40:12.106 --> 01:40:14.346
And what are you hiding
under your jacket?

01:40:16.189 --> 01:40:17.849
Love.

01:40:17.981 --> 01:40:19.806
Uh-huh...

01:40:19.939 --> 01:40:22.855
You can't bring animals in here,
this is the isolation ward.

01:40:22.981 --> 01:40:27.686
Ma'am, this is a very deadly animal.

01:40:31.272 --> 01:40:32.647
C'mon.

01:40:33.564 --> 01:40:36.349
Two of you can go.
And the other two need to go to...

01:40:36.481 --> 01:40:39.562
Don't let the doctors see you!
You need to go to the cafeteria--

01:40:39.689 --> 01:40:41.146
And wear gloves and a mask.

01:40:47.439 --> 01:40:51.386
- Hey.
- How's it going?

01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:55.638
Here you go.

01:40:56.980 --> 01:40:59.054
He reminded me of you.

01:40:59.189 --> 01:41:01.559
He's just like you. He...

01:41:01.689 --> 01:41:03.064
He also likes to fuck.

- I can't.
- He...

01:41:24.813 --> 01:41:26.519
He hasn't been drawing much lately.

01:41:30.188 --> 01:41:31.515
Why not?

01:41:34.688 --> 01:41:37.853
I caused all this.

01:41:41.438 --> 01:41:43.144
You gave me life.

01:41:44.480 --> 01:41:46.269
You showed me love.

01:41:48.146 --> 01:41:49.640
Wouldn't change a thing.

01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:55.061
- You sure?
Positive.

It's just a fucking virus.

<i>I'm going to draw something to publish.</i>

<i>About life.

(man) Hello, gentlemen.

01:44:22.186 --> 01:44:26.132
- Can I help you?
- Maybe.

01:44:28.852 --> 01:44:29.681
Please.

01:44:29.810 --> 01:44:31.766
We have something

01:44:33.102 --> 01:44:34.975
Ay, ay, av!

01:44:35.852 --> 01:44:37.595
Ay, ay, av!

01:44:41.435 --> 01:44:43.059
Sir, we're here to do business.

01:44:44.935 --> 01:44:47.139
Why did you come to me?

01:44:47.268 --> 01:44:49.840
We were turned down
by the other printing houses.

01:44:49.977 --> 01:44:53.141
- In Santa Monica?
- In all of LA.

01:44:54.352 --> 01:44:57.137
Alphabetically.
-(man) I see.

01:44:57.268 --> 01:44:59.224
You might go to prison for this.

01:45:00.393 --> 01:45:03.842
- Aren't you afraid?
- Mr Zagat...

01:45:03.977 --> 01:45:05.849
I fought Stalin's army with a knife.

01:45:07.268 --> 01:45:08.465
<i>(laughs)</i>

01:45:08.601 --> 01:45:12.050
But as you see,
my business is primarily religious.

This is sacred to me.

01:45:22.601 --> 01:45:25.268
But it is only me and my daughter.

01:45:26.143 --> 01:45:29.142
I can't print and bind 10,000 books
just like that.
