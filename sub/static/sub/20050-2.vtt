WEBVTT

00:13.681 --> 00:15.516
(Springs creaking)

00:15.600 --> 00:17.769
Ricky: Oh, yeah, baby,
that's the stuff.

00:17.852 --> 00:20.104
Oh, that's a nice rhythm,
just like that.

00:20.187 --> 00:23.148
Yeah, just keep going
like that. Ohhh...

00:23.232 --> 00:24.776
Trinity:
Oh, my God, Jacob!

00:24.859 --> 00:26.778
Dad, help!

00:26.861 --> 00:28.821
Ricky:
What the fuck's going
on, Trin, you okay?

00:28.905 --> 00:30.114
Trinity:
It's Jacob, he won't wake up!

00:30.197 --> 00:31.699
I can't tell if he's breathing.

00:31.783 --> 00:34.285
Woman:
Jacob, Jacob, wake up!

00:34.368 --> 00:35.787
Ricky:
Okay, just a minute.
I'll be right in, Trin.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.121
Trinity:
Oh, my God!

00:37.204 --> 00:38.790
He's breathing.

00:38.873 --> 00:40.708
He's not okay.
I don't know what's wrong.

00:40.792 --> 00:42.877
Ricky: Come on, we don't have
a lot of time,
gotta make this quick.

00:42.961 --> 00:44.670
Just ignore the voices!
We can do this. Come on!

00:44.754 --> 00:45.922
Jesus Christ!
Sarah:
Holy shit!

00:46.005 --> 00:47.506
What the fuck are
you doing, Sarah?

00:47.590 --> 00:50.301
What am I doing? What
the fuck are you doing?

00:50.384 --> 00:52.052
Fuck off with the camera!

00:52.136 --> 00:53.471
Who the fuck
were you talking to?

00:53.554 --> 00:54.680
My hand.

00:54.764 --> 00:55.974
What?
Sarah, I'm sorry,

00:56.056 --> 00:57.642
this is all
I got right now.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.978
I find if I talk with my hand,
it works a bit better, okay?

01:00.060 --> 01:01.186
Ricky, you are
so fucked!

01:01.270 --> 01:02.480
What the fuck's
going on with Jacob?

01:02.563 --> 01:04.941
He's fucked up.
Come in.

01:05.024 --> 01:06.150
(Shallow breathing)
Ricky:
Holy fuck!

01:06.233 --> 01:08.152
Holy Fuck! Okay,
Trin, stay calm.

01:08.235 --> 01:09.737
Grab a fucking knife
or something sharp.

01:09.821 --> 01:11.489
You gotta shove it
right through his eye socket

01:11.572 --> 01:13.157
and make sure it comes
out the other side.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.826
Dad, what the fuck
are you talking about?

01:14.909 --> 01:16.160
He's turned, Trin,
he's turned.

01:16.243 --> 01:18.162
It's too late for
him now, okay?

01:18.245 --> 01:19.998
Have you ever seen
"The Walking Of The Dead"?
It's okay, dude.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.958
Stay calm, everyone.
Stay calm. Okay,
get away from him!

01:22.041 --> 01:23.793
I'm gonna shoot him
through the fucking head!

01:23.876 --> 01:25.753
That's what you've gotta do!
I gotta shoot through
the fucking head.

01:25.837 --> 01:27.546
Bubbles:
Ricky! What are you doing?

01:27.630 --> 01:29.882
Stay back! Stay back!
He'll try to bite you!
Dad, stop!

01:29.966 --> 01:31.342
You can't shoot your
son-in-law in the head!

01:31.425 --> 01:33.260
He's not my fucking
son-of-law anymore.

01:33.344 --> 01:35.095
He's a walker zombley!
He's not gonna eat
my fucking family!

01:35.179 --> 01:38.557
(Theme music)

02:17.304 --> 02:19.682
(Mixed yelling)
If he bites us,

02:19.765 --> 02:21.893
we're all going to
be fucking zomblies.

02:21.976 --> 02:23.644
Get out of the way!
(Yells)

02:23.728 --> 02:26.605
(Mixed yelling)

02:26.689 --> 02:29.067
If we don't shoot him, we're
all gonna fucking die here.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.569
Ricky, give me the fucking
gun! What are you doing?
Give it to me.

02:31.652 --> 02:33.237
(Yells)
He's a zomblie.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.656
Would everybody
calm down, please.

02:35.740 --> 02:37.199
Ricky.
What?

02:37.282 --> 02:38.910
There's no such thing
as zombies, okay?

02:38.993 --> 02:40.536
What the fuck is
that, right there?
Rick!

02:40.619 --> 02:42.747
We've got a lot
of work to do.
Stop fucking around.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.083
Dad, you have to take
him to the hospital.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.584
We've got a bit
of running around to do.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.086
I'll take him
right after that.
No, Dad, now.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.294
Look at him.

02:49.378 --> 02:51.547
He needs to go
to the hospital.

02:51.630 --> 02:54.092
I'm sorry, Julian. I know
we got a lot of stuff to
do but family comes first.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.635
I love my fucking family.
Family?
Who? That?

02:56.719 --> 02:59.097
The guy you were gonna shoot
in the head two seconds ago?

02:59.179 --> 03:00.639
Hi, Julian!

03:00.723 --> 03:02.266
Two seconds ago that
wasn't Jacob in my mind.

03:02.349 --> 03:04.143
We've got to take him.
I don't want to catch
this shit

03:04.226 --> 03:05.895
and the rest of my
family catching it!

03:05.978 --> 03:07.271
Julian, it could be a fucking
crazy squirrel disease.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.982
I bet that's what it is.

03:10.066 --> 03:11.776
Fuck's sakes.
All right. Cory,

03:11.859 --> 03:13.819
get him out of those
sex underwear and
strap him on the roof

03:13.903 --> 03:15.738
with some straps and
top up my brake fluid.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.615
My brakes have been fucking
me around lately, all right?
'kay, dude.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.825
Dad, you're not strapping
him to the roof of the car!

03:19.909 --> 03:22.286
He can ride in the car.
I'm not catching that shit.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.288
Put him in the trunk, then.
He's probably gonna fucking
die anyway.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.290
What? You think
I might die?

03:26.373 --> 03:27.666
Have you looked
at yourself?

03:27.750 --> 03:29.961
Yes, you could
fucking die!
You look fucked!

03:30.044 --> 03:31.879
All right, Cory, you're gonna
go with them to the hospital.

03:31.963 --> 03:33.631
Bubs, let's go to
the nutrients store.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.174
Don't worry. We'll
take care of him.

03:35.257 --> 03:36.842
All right, sweetie?
Good to see you guys.

03:36.926 --> 03:39.344
Ricky, stop fucking around.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.680
Promise?
Bubbles:
He promises, Julian.

03:41.764 --> 03:44.308
I'm fucking sorry,
I thought you were a
fucking zombley.

03:44.391 --> 03:45.643
But why would you
go and do this?

03:45.726 --> 03:48.020
Like, you completely
fucked this day up!

03:48.104 --> 03:50.022
I'm really sorry, Ricky.

03:51.273 --> 03:53.484
I'm not jealous, Randy.

03:53.567 --> 03:54.902
I just care about
you, that's all.

03:54.986 --> 03:56.654
And I don't want
to see you get hurt.

03:58.405 --> 04:01.909
And I'm sorry if
I care about you.

04:01.993 --> 04:04.495
Randy, come on and
get your breakfast.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.998
Double sugar bacon!

04:07.081 --> 04:08.582
Randy:
I'm not eating
that, sir.

04:08.666 --> 04:09.875
I'm off the bacon.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.169
Oh, you're off the bacon?

04:11.251 --> 04:12.544
Since when?

04:12.628 --> 04:15.506
You had two whole
packages on Tuesday.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.757
Randy:
Well, no anymore.

04:16.841 --> 04:19.677
I'm in training.

04:19.760 --> 04:20.886
Where did you
get the shirt?

04:20.970 --> 04:22.138
Ted gave it to me.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.347
He's gonna help train me

04:23.430 --> 04:24.682
and he's going to
pull some strings

04:24.765 --> 04:26.350
to get me into the
police college.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.811
Oh, I see.

04:28.894 --> 04:30.980
Is that all he's gonna
be pulling, Randy?

04:32.648 --> 04:33.858
I don't like this, Randy.

04:33.941 --> 04:35.860
I don't fucking
like this one bit!

04:35.943 --> 04:37.611
Well, I'm doing it, sir.

04:37.695 --> 04:39.864
And, if you care
about me as much
as you say you do,

04:39.947 --> 04:42.366
you'll be supportive
and proud of me.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.076
(Car honk beeping)

04:45.410 --> 04:47.079
If anything crazy
goes down here today,

04:47.163 --> 04:49.748
call me on my
cell for back-up.

04:52.835 --> 04:54.045
For fuck's sakes!

04:54.128 --> 04:55.337
(Dishes clatter)

04:59.008 --> 05:01.010
Ricky:
Is he dead yet?

05:01.093 --> 05:02.720
Cory:
Okay, we made it, dude.

05:02.803 --> 05:04.722
You're gonna be all right.
How do you feel?

05:04.805 --> 05:07.099
Oh, I felt better before
we left but I feel worse now.

05:07.183 --> 05:08.976
(Coughs)
I think it's the exhaust fumes.

05:09.060 --> 05:11.020
Cory:
Oh, man, I'm gonna
get a wheelchair.

05:11.103 --> 05:12.479
It could be the
exhaust fumes

05:12.563 --> 05:14.773
or it could be more
Symp-sons coming on.

05:14.857 --> 05:16.358
If it is the exhaust
fumes, here smoke this.

05:16.441 --> 05:17.651
It'll cancel them out.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.238
Listen, Jacob.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.406
There's something I
want you to know, bud.

05:22.489 --> 05:25.910
I know that you probably
think that I think,
you know, you're...

05:25.993 --> 05:29.538
a fucking idiot,
you're like some
weird insect-y man.

05:29.621 --> 05:32.166
You know, my daughter
married a loser
with no fucking money

05:32.250 --> 05:34.376
and no chance of
keeping a good job
because you're too dumb.

05:34.459 --> 05:37.129
But you know what?
It doesn't even matter
if I did think all that.

05:37.213 --> 05:39.006
I actually think...
(Coughs)

05:39.090 --> 05:41.092
that you're a
pretty good guy.

05:41.175 --> 05:42.801
I actually like you.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.095
Thanks, man.

05:44.178 --> 05:46.264
I think I've may
even been...

05:46.346 --> 05:48.473
starting to love
you a little bit.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.434
Anyway I just wanted
you to know all that

05:50.517 --> 05:51.936
'cause you're probably
not gonna make it.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.145
What?

05:53.229 --> 05:54.646
You think I'm
not gonna make it?

05:54.730 --> 05:56.148
Look at your
fucking hair.

05:56.232 --> 05:57.649
It's just coming
right out, buddy.

05:57.733 --> 05:59.777
You're fucked.
(Panting, wheezing)

05:59.860 --> 06:01.028
Don't worry,
though, buddy.

06:01.112 --> 06:02.821
Come on, we'll
get you inside.

06:02.905 --> 06:04.656
Me and Cory
we're gonna be with
you till the end.

06:04.740 --> 06:06.033
The end?

06:06.117 --> 06:07.743
What do you mean,
the end?

06:09.703 --> 06:10.955
What do you mean,
the end?

06:12.372 --> 06:14.250
(Clanking)
Jesus Christ, Cory!

06:15.626 --> 06:17.461
Why is all this shit
so expensive, man?

06:17.544 --> 06:19.671
Look, that's 80 bucks.
Oh, I know.

06:19.755 --> 06:21.715
I've been buying
it. I know how
expensive it is.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.134
Bubs, stop grabbing
at yourself.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.010
I'm not grabbing
at myself.

06:25.094 --> 06:26.971
I get nervous and my
bird starts doing that.

06:27.054 --> 06:29.181
If it's not at the
right angle, I get
a kink into it.

06:29.265 --> 06:31.309
Why are you nervous?
We're not doing
anything illegal.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.311
Oh, no... Nothing
illegal about growing

06:33.393 --> 06:35.854
400 fucking dope plants
in record time!

06:35.938 --> 06:37.273
Nothing illegal there.

06:37.356 --> 06:38.523
We're buying
fertilizer, man.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.192
Yeah!
Fuck, just relax.

06:40.276 --> 06:42.611
Alrighty, fellas,
I've done some digging here.

06:43.988 --> 06:45.906
I can do pretty much everything
on the old list here, buddy.

06:45.990 --> 06:47.158
Perfect.
Except for the...

06:47.241 --> 06:49.493
Nuclear Bloom,
she's on back order.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.703
What? Isn't that the
most important shit?

06:51.787 --> 06:53.289
How in the fuck
is it on back order?

06:53.372 --> 06:55.207
Last week you had
almost a full barrel.

06:55.291 --> 06:57.335
Yeah, but it's Sonny Ding,
the potato farmer.

06:57.417 --> 06:58.669
Come in and
bought it all.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.045
Sonny Ding from
Eastern Shore?

07:00.129 --> 07:02.381
Yeah... Yeah, he's
only got one upper lip.

07:02.464 --> 07:03.882
No, that's not Sonny.

07:03.966 --> 07:05.926
(Chuckles)
Everybody's only
got one upper lip.

07:06.010 --> 07:07.845
I'm just
fucking with you!
You got me.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.180
So when are you
getting more in?

07:09.263 --> 07:11.015
Oh, you're looking
at two weeks.

07:11.098 --> 07:13.017
Yeah... Slow boat
from China shit.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.477
Fuck's sakes.
Fucking China!

07:15.560 --> 07:17.062
And their slow boats!
I know.

07:20.107 --> 07:22.360
A bit of a
wake-up call, huh?

07:22.442 --> 07:24.903
The police force
is not for everybody.

07:24.987 --> 07:26.864
This is ridiculous.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.034
There's lots of cops
fatter than I am around.

07:30.117 --> 07:32.119
Actually, no there's not.

07:32.203 --> 07:33.954
You're gonna have to lose
at least 50 pounds

07:34.038 --> 07:36.999
if I have any hope
in hell of getting
you into the college.

07:38.376 --> 07:40.878
Frig this.
(Panting)

07:40.961 --> 07:44.131
I'm not losing any
frigging weight.

07:44.215 --> 07:47.385
You gotta figure out
a way to get me into
the frigging college

07:47.467 --> 07:49.136
or George is
gonna see this.

07:49.220 --> 07:50.470
(Video recording on phone)
Ted:<i> Harder.</i>

07:50.554 --> 07:52.056
Randy:
<i>Why isn't it working?</i>

07:52.139 --> 07:53.765
Ted:<i> Oh yeah.</i>
Randy:<i> How's that, Ted?</i>

07:53.849 --> 07:57.019
Ted:
<i>Try harder, Randy,</i>
<i>try harder. Ooohh yeah.</i>

07:57.102 --> 07:59.730
Now take me through the
drive thru at the King.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.940
And you're
frigging paying!

08:06.570 --> 08:09.073
Big fuck-up, Cory.
(Chuckles)

08:09.156 --> 08:12.910
(Indistinct call on P.A.)

08:12.993 --> 08:14.245
Bye-bye.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.121
Err, dude, I think
the horse moves in...

08:16.205 --> 08:18.582
the shape of an R or
letter M or something.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.918
What kind of a fucking
hornse would move in the
shape of letters?

08:21.001 --> 08:23.045
It's a hornse. It goes
wherever the fuck it wants.

08:23.128 --> 08:25.756
Unless it tied up but,
see any ropes here?
It's not tied up.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.716
Fuck, you're dumb
sometimes, Cory.

08:27.799 --> 08:30.428
I'm sorry, dude. Man,
I'm just so freaked out
about Jacob, man.

08:30.510 --> 08:32.137
I don't know what to do.
I know.

08:32.221 --> 08:35.099
Fuck, he's so young.
What a shame.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.475
I know it must be
hard on you.

08:36.558 --> 08:38.269
I mean, you already lost
one idiot best friend

08:38.352 --> 08:39.478
and now you're going
to lose another one.

08:39.561 --> 08:41.105
It's not fair.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.441
Well, I don't he's gonna
die or anything, dude.

08:43.523 --> 08:47.027
I think...
Oh, fuck, I knew it!

08:47.111 --> 08:48.446
He didn't make it.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.780
What?

08:49.863 --> 08:51.198
Are you serious?
Fuck!

08:51.282 --> 08:52.616
Jacob's dead?

08:52.699 --> 08:54.493
No! No, no...

08:54.576 --> 08:55.869
Cory, come here, bud.

08:55.953 --> 08:57.246
We're gonna get
through this, man.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.290
How the fuck am I
going to tell Trin?

08:59.373 --> 09:00.499
(Sobbing)
Fuck's sakes!

09:00.582 --> 09:02.460
Guys, guys,
Jacob's not dead.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.336
He just had an allergic
reaction to dog hair.

09:04.420 --> 09:06.130
But a violent one.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.173
That's it?
He's allergic
to dogs?

09:08.257 --> 09:09.549
Oh, my fuck.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.302
Jacob, you
fucking idiot!

09:11.385 --> 09:12.844
I'm really
sorry, Ricky.

09:12.928 --> 09:14.763
It's, uh, it's not
Jacob's fault.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.974
He has a very strange
element in his blood.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.017
I've not been able
to identify it

09:19.101 --> 09:21.479
but I'm guessing
it's related to his
reaction to the dog.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.896
Now, uh, make sure you
keep this bracelet on.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.107
It's got all your
information on it.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.943
If the condition worsens,
I want you to come back
here immediately.

09:28.026 --> 09:29.861
Okay, thanks, Doctor.
(Phone rings)

09:29.945 --> 09:31.155
Hey, Julian.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.031
Still dealing with
Fuckbrains here.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.451
He's allergic to
dogs apparently.

09:35.534 --> 09:38.120
Ooh, I'm going
to make everyone
think I'm fucking dying!

09:38.203 --> 09:41.165
Yeah. Yeah,
it's right here.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.666
Fuck off!
I'm on the phone.

09:42.749 --> 09:44.084
I forgot where
I was, okay?

09:46.003 --> 09:48.506
Yeah. I know exactly
where that is, man.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.215
I'll be there in
15 minutes. Okay.

09:52.217 --> 09:53.677
Hey, Ricky, can we
stop and get this
prescription filled

09:53.760 --> 09:54.928
on the way back
to the park?

09:55.012 --> 09:56.680
Yeah, we can. On the
way back to the park

09:56.763 --> 09:58.349
but right now we're not going
back to the fucking park.

09:58.432 --> 09:59.683
Get the fuck
out to the car!

09:59.766 --> 10:00.934
You've wasted enough
of today already!

10:01.018 --> 10:02.436
Fucking dog allergy!

10:02.520 --> 10:04.229
What are you going to say
you're dying from next?

10:04.313 --> 10:05.897
Getting stanged
by a fucking bee?

10:05.981 --> 10:07.525
I hope not.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.026
How long are you
going to be this
fucking colour?

10:09.109 --> 10:10.402
You look
ridiculous.

10:10.486 --> 10:11.653
I'm really
sorry, Ricky.

10:11.736 --> 10:13.572
I don't know
what's going on.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.199
What are you doing
going through the
fucking door first?

10:15.282 --> 10:16.575
Jesus Christ!
Sorry!

10:18.494 --> 10:19.744
Thanks, dude.

10:21.455 --> 10:23.374
I can't believe he didn't
have a fucking drop left!

10:23.457 --> 10:24.916
Not a fucking drop, Ricky.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.460
She's all
in there somewhere.

10:26.544 --> 10:28.045
Well, just FIY,
there's no fucking way

10:28.128 --> 10:30.255
we'll grow enough weed in
43 days without that shit.

10:30.339 --> 10:33.551
We're fucked!
Way to go, Jacob!

10:33.633 --> 10:35.052
Sorry, dude.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.720
Jacob, all you have
is a fucking allergy?

10:36.803 --> 10:37.929
Yeah.
Well, kinda.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.223
Doctor said
I had some sort

10:39.306 --> 10:40.558
of unidentified
element in my blood.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.394
Unidentified element?

10:43.477 --> 10:45.437
Okay, boys, there's
nobody around.

10:45.521 --> 10:48.357
It looks like the barrels
are up in that first
outbuilding up there, okay?

10:48.440 --> 10:50.234
Cory, Jacob, I want
you to grab the truck,

10:50.317 --> 10:52.194
go up and grab
the fucking barrel.

10:52.277 --> 10:54.112
You got it.
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hang on!

10:54.196 --> 10:56.073
Grab what truck? My truck?
Yeah.

10:56.156 --> 10:58.576
No, no, no. I worked way too
fucking hard for that truck

10:58.658 --> 11:02.746
to let fucking Red ET
and Drewberry Dumb
fucking use the thing.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.331
That's not happening.

11:04.415 --> 11:06.041
Bubs, do you have
insurance?

11:06.124 --> 11:08.460
Yes, I have insurance.
I'm a legit businessman.

11:08.544 --> 11:10.212
Well, circumstances
like this is...

11:10.295 --> 11:12.506
that's why you fucking
have insurance.

11:12.590 --> 11:15.967
Oh, yeah, no, I remember
reading that actually in
the insurance policy.

11:16.051 --> 11:18.429
Paragraph 1: "If you use
your truck to steal something

11:18.512 --> 11:20.305
and it gets fucked over while
the crime is in progress,

11:20.389 --> 11:23.350
you are covered 100%
with zero deductible."

11:23.434 --> 11:25.143
Bubs, if something
get fucked over,

11:25.227 --> 11:26.978
which is not
gonna happen,

11:27.062 --> 11:29.398
we'll just fucking burn the
thing and report it stolen.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.275
You can say
there was tons of
shit in the front,

11:31.358 --> 11:32.734
tons of shit
in the back.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.819
It's a win-win
situation here, man.

11:34.903 --> 11:36.738
And then you can buy
a real fucking truck.

11:36.821 --> 11:39.783
A real t... That is
a fucking real truck!

11:39.866 --> 11:41.868
You know who uses great
big trucks, Julian?

11:41.952 --> 11:43.120
Who drives
around in those?

11:43.203 --> 11:44.580
Guys with little,
tiny wieners.

11:44.663 --> 11:45.830
That's who
drives those.

11:45.914 --> 11:47.124
Oh, wait a second,

11:47.207 --> 11:48.959
don't you have a
ridiculously large

11:49.042 --> 11:50.669
jacked-up fucking
G.I. Joemobile?

11:50.752 --> 11:53.171
Real funny.
Real fucking...
Go fuck yourself!

11:53.255 --> 11:55.299
Look, are we just
gonna say to fuck
with everything?

11:55.382 --> 11:57.342
You know, 'cause I'm quite
happy to go out in the ocean

11:57.426 --> 11:59.010
and fucking fish
lobsters, man.

11:59.094 --> 12:01.138
All right?
It's up to you.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.307
Then maybe we can
hook up at Christmas
time or something.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.601
'Cause I don't
give a fuck!

12:05.684 --> 12:07.227
I know what you're
doing, Julian.

12:07.311 --> 12:10.439
Yeah?
Is it working?

12:10.522 --> 12:12.483
(Sighing)
Fuck off.

12:12.566 --> 12:14.859
All right, give him
those keys. Let's go, boys.

12:14.943 --> 12:16.361
(Sighs)
Here, boys.

12:16.445 --> 12:19.615
Do not fuck
this truck up!

12:19.698 --> 12:21.408
Right on, boys.
(Keys clicking)

12:21.492 --> 12:22.826
Cory, Cory!

12:22.909 --> 12:24.411
That... Come here.

12:24.495 --> 12:26.079
Click that again.
(Clicking)

12:26.163 --> 12:27.372
See the fire
coming out of there?

12:27.456 --> 12:29.667
It's a lighter.
(Soft grunt)

12:29.749 --> 12:32.002
Don't be fucking
with it.

12:33.629 --> 12:34.796
(Clicking continues)
(Long sigh)

12:34.879 --> 12:36.173
If my truck
gets fucked up...

12:36.256 --> 12:37.924
It's not going
to get fucked up.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.176
No, let me finish.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.136
If my truck
gets fucked up,

12:41.219 --> 12:42.471
I'm getting
your truck.

12:42.554 --> 12:44.181
I'm taking it
and I'm selling it.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.391
To somebody else
with a tiny wiener.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.894
(Gunshots)
Ted:
Gentle now, Randy.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.063
Gentle...
Just like that.

12:53.315 --> 12:54.733
(Gunshots)
Ah! Ah!

12:54.816 --> 12:56.360
Jesus!
Fucking Christ!
What the hell are doing?

12:56.443 --> 12:57.569
Well, I've never
frigging fired

12:57.653 --> 12:58.862
one of these
things before!

12:58.945 --> 13:00.197
Come on,
let's just go.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.032
No, I've got to
learn this, Ted.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.576
I suggest you
friggin wrap your
friggin arms around me

13:04.660 --> 13:06.286
and show me
how to hold this.

13:06.370 --> 13:08.205
Unless you want the
guys downtown to know

13:08.288 --> 13:11.041
some of the weird stuff
that you like done to you.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.459
(Gunshots continue)

13:12.543 --> 13:13.877
Come on.

13:13.960 --> 13:15.212
Yeah, yeah,
okay, okay.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.255
Widen your stance.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.049
Straighten your arms.

13:19.132 --> 13:21.092
Also stick your
bum out a little.

13:21.176 --> 13:23.220
Okay... shoot.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.763
(Gunshot)
Ahh!

13:24.846 --> 13:27.558
(Grunts of effort)

13:27.641 --> 13:30.143
(Straining)

13:30.227 --> 13:31.978
Jeez, man!
This is crazy!

13:32.062 --> 13:33.897
It's like, I'm pushing,
I'm pulling,

13:33.980 --> 13:35.273
it's not even locked.

13:35.357 --> 13:37.150
Nothing!

13:37.234 --> 13:38.902
(Grunting)

13:38.985 --> 13:40.612
There we go.

13:40.696 --> 13:42.406
Hey, I knew that.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.865
All right.

13:45.825 --> 13:46.951
No.

13:47.035 --> 13:49.371
(Dull thuds)
No.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.248
No.
Hey, Cory, this one
sounds different.

13:51.331 --> 13:52.957
Listen:
it sounds full...
(Dull thuds)

13:53.041 --> 13:54.834
(Hollow thuds)
...the rest sound empty.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.253
You sure?

13:56.336 --> 13:57.588
Yeah, listen.
(Tapping)

13:57.671 --> 13:59.297
Hear the difference?

13:59.381 --> 14:00.758
Well, what if
this one...
(Hollow thuds)

14:00.840 --> 14:03.051
is full and
that's empty?
(Dull thud)

14:05.262 --> 14:06.638
(Clattering)

14:06.722 --> 14:08.807
See? Full.

14:08.890 --> 14:11.059
Right on, dude,
let's do it.

14:11.142 --> 14:13.270
Ho...ly shit.
(Grunt)

14:13.353 --> 14:15.397
On three.
One...
One, two, three.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.108
(Straining)
Sorry, I didn't
really help.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.235
One, two, three.

14:20.318 --> 14:21.945
Cool.
(Grunt)

14:22.028 --> 14:23.947
Hey, careful.
Okay.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.450
Right.
That's easy, dude.

14:26.533 --> 14:28.493
All right,
just don't drop it.

14:28.577 --> 14:30.161
I'm not saying
there's no such
thing as aliens.

14:30.245 --> 14:33.123
All I'm saying is Jacob
is not a fucking alien.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.792
Ricky, Ricky,
did the doctor say

14:34.874 --> 14:38.002
that Jacob had an
"unidentified element"
in his blood?

14:38.086 --> 14:39.296
That's what he said.
Yeah,

14:39.379 --> 14:40.922
because he's a fucking
alien, Julian.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.216
He's a new species.
He's a Tall Red,

14:43.300 --> 14:45.427
descended from
the Tall Whites,
I guarantee you.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.095
This mean my fucking
grampson's an alien?

14:47.178 --> 14:48.346
Well, he's half.

14:48.430 --> 14:49.807
Mo's not
a fucking alien!

14:49.889 --> 14:51.349
Jacob's not a
fucking alien!

14:51.433 --> 14:53.059
Yeah?
Yeah!

14:53.143 --> 14:54.311
Who have you
ever seen

14:54.394 --> 14:55.895
with four-foot-long
arms, Julian,

14:55.979 --> 14:57.815
that turns red
for no reason?
(Cellphone ringing)

14:57.939 --> 15:00.484
Bubs, he looks
like a fucking alien,
all right?

15:00.567 --> 15:02.986
Ricky's NHL ball hockey camp.
How may I help you?

15:03.069 --> 15:04.529
There's no date
on the poster yet

15:04.613 --> 15:06.531
'cause I haven't
fucking picked one.

15:06.615 --> 15:09.451
'Cause I'm waiting
to see if there's
any interest first.

15:09.534 --> 15:11.495
It says<i> possible</i>
because I can't see
in the future, okay?

15:11.578 --> 15:13.079
They all say
they want to come,

15:13.163 --> 15:14.706
what happens maybe
they're on their way here

15:14.790 --> 15:16.333
and a fucking
earthquake derupts,

15:16.416 --> 15:18.335
it fucking opens up,
swallows the fucking car,

15:18.418 --> 15:20.671
and they're never seen
or heard from again?

15:20.754 --> 15:22.130
It could happen, right?

15:22.213 --> 15:23.715
Then I'd be
a fucking liar.
I'm not a liar.

15:23.799 --> 15:26.343
My poster's not
a fucking liar.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.345
Look, if you're interested,
call me back in a few days.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.847
If you're not, it doesn't
really matter to me,

15:29.929 --> 15:31.097
I don't give a fuck.

15:31.181 --> 15:32.349
Fuck, people are stupid.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.017
Ricky, that had to be

15:34.100 --> 15:36.394
the dumbest conversation
I've ever heard in my life.

15:36.478 --> 15:40.106
But no, you should've
heard what she was saying!

15:40.190 --> 15:41.941
He's a fucking
alien, Julian.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.360
All right, boys...
I'm telling you.

15:43.443 --> 15:44.569
What are you
doing, man?
Hang on, boys!

15:44.653 --> 15:45.863
Why do you always...
Whoo-oo!

15:45.945 --> 15:47.197
Ricky!
Slow the fuck down!

15:47.280 --> 15:48.365
(Cackling)
Ricky, slow
the fuck down!

15:48.448 --> 15:50.367
Aww, fuck! The brakes
ain't working!

15:50.450 --> 15:51.660
(Crash, clattering)
Man:
What the fuck!

15:51.743 --> 15:53.370
Ricky:
Jesus Christ! Fucking Cory!

15:53.453 --> 15:54.621
Julian:
Back it up, Ricky!

15:54.705 --> 15:56.373
Bubbles:
Oh, fucking
nice one, Ricky.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.667
Man: Holy shit!
What the fuck, man!
A nice one.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.879
Fuck's sakes.
Crashed into that
guy's nice truck.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.380
I hope my car's
all right.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.261
What the fuck did
you do to the truck?

16:10.345 --> 16:11.555
It's just
a little scratch.
Fuck!

16:11.638 --> 16:13.348
I got the worst of it,
you fucking dummy.

16:13.431 --> 16:15.392
What?
You heard me.

16:15.475 --> 16:19.103
Take your tiny cock,
get in your truck
and fuck off.

16:19.187 --> 16:21.523
Huh! You got
the worst of it?

16:21.606 --> 16:23.274
(Mirthless chuckle)
Julian:
Gun!

16:23.358 --> 16:24.735
Bubbles:
Jesus Christ!

16:24.818 --> 16:27.612
(Gunshots)
Fuck!

16:27.696 --> 16:29.614
Boys, have I got
to die in Reggie's
junk yard

16:29.698 --> 16:31.950
because of
a fucking power
slide gone wrong?

16:32.033 --> 16:33.243
Can we all put down our guns

16:33.326 --> 16:35.746
and talk like normal
fucking human beings?

16:35.829 --> 16:37.915
(Gunshots)

16:37.997 --> 16:39.249
Oh, shit, dude, man,

16:39.332 --> 16:40.876
you're totally like
my superhero, man.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.920
Like, a real live
superhero, man,
you're my hero!

16:43.002 --> 16:45.255
All red and shit,
lifting the barrel
over your head, man.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.591
You totally did
most of the work.
You know that, right?

16:47.674 --> 16:49.801
I don't
remember, man.
(Awkward chuckle)

16:49.885 --> 16:51.428
I feel like
I'm dying, dude.

16:51.511 --> 16:52.804
Well, that's
just it, man.

16:52.888 --> 16:54.389
It's like, whatever
we put our minds to,

16:54.472 --> 16:56.600
we can do together.
Do you know
what I mean?

16:56.683 --> 16:58.685
Even when we're dying,
we get shit done, man.

16:58.769 --> 16:59.937
Thanks, man.
You know what?

17:00.019 --> 17:01.271
You complete me, man.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.773
Thanks, man.
Hand me off.
Dunk.

17:02.856 --> 17:04.107
Oh, sh...
Careful, man.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.359
Sorry, dude.
Let me get...

17:06.443 --> 17:07.736
Oh, shit, man.

17:07.819 --> 17:10.071
Uh... I think
the barrel's gone.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.698
What, you think
it's gone or it's gone?

17:11.782 --> 17:13.241
Dude, I think
the barrel's gone.

17:13.324 --> 17:15.577
We had a barrel in
the back and the
shit is gone. Look.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.454
Dude, I can't see.
We've got to go
back and get it.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.706
We've got to go
back and get it.
Go, go, go, go...!

17:19.790 --> 17:21.040
(Gunshots, dog barking)

17:21.124 --> 17:22.292
Man:
You got insurance?

17:22.375 --> 17:23.668
Do I look fucking
dumb enough

17:23.752 --> 17:25.503
to buy insurance,
you little shit vacuum?

17:25.587 --> 17:28.924
(Gunshots)

17:29.007 --> 17:31.969
Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa! Whoa!

17:32.051 --> 17:34.220
What the fuck is going on,

17:34.304 --> 17:36.306
you pigeon poking fucks?

17:36.389 --> 17:38.475
You're scaring the shit
out of my cust...

17:38.558 --> 17:40.310
Put the fucking
weapons away!

17:40.393 --> 17:42.145
Hey, Reg.
Reggie:
Moose fuckers!

17:42.228 --> 17:44.815
I fucking slid into
this come gargler's
dicktruck here

17:44.898 --> 17:46.232
and he fucking
lost it on me.

17:46.316 --> 17:48.192
Look at the little
tiny scratch.
Ah, Ricky...

17:48.276 --> 17:50.028
Reggie:
So, Dougie.

17:50.111 --> 17:51.696
Nice.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.531
Here's how this is
going to go down.

17:53.615 --> 17:54.908
You two guys

17:54.992 --> 17:56.367
are going to take
your short, stumpy,

17:56.451 --> 17:57.828
hobbitty asses,

17:57.911 --> 18:00.497
get in this
gigantic truck thing

18:00.580 --> 18:02.666
and get the fuck
off my yard.

18:02.749 --> 18:03.917
Who the fuck are
you calling short,

18:04.001 --> 18:05.502
stubby, and hobbitty,

18:05.585 --> 18:09.047
you long-legged...
arctic-blonde prick?

18:09.130 --> 18:10.841
Go fuck yourself, huh?

18:10.924 --> 18:13.176
No, no, no, I think
it's "go fuck yourself",

18:13.259 --> 18:14.594
you know, 'cause
the universe

18:14.678 --> 18:17.180
is not responsible
for you two dipshits

18:17.263 --> 18:20.350
growing up to be
mouse-diddlers,
are they?

18:20.433 --> 18:23.186
So lose
the fucking attitude

18:23.269 --> 18:27.398
and can we all
just stop<i> shooting</i>
at each other?

18:27.482 --> 18:29.400
Now, you two,
fuck off!

18:29.484 --> 18:31.028
(Quietly)
You fuck off.

18:32.821 --> 18:34.865
Bubbles:
Short guys in big trucks.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.200
There's nothing
fucking worse.

18:37.283 --> 18:38.618
(Engine ignition)

18:42.831 --> 18:44.165
Now what, pray tell,
can I do

18:44.248 --> 18:46.793
for you
turtle jerkers?

18:46.877 --> 18:49.337
Can I just ask
what the fuck
is up with you

18:49.420 --> 18:52.966
and all the
animal sex fucking
references you use?

18:53.050 --> 18:54.885
Well, it's kind
of my thing, dude.

18:54.968 --> 18:56.720
It's cool, man.
Julian :
We need clones.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.722
Lots of them.
Now you have
my attention.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.515
How much is a lot?
300 or 400?

19:00.598 --> 19:03.142
(Laughing)
Yeah, that's good,
Cheech and Chong.

19:03.226 --> 19:05.562
What am I, fucking
Up In fucking Smoke here?

19:05.645 --> 19:07.898
Oh, fuck's sakes,
you can't do it?

19:07.981 --> 19:09.273
Well, now, I
didn't say that,

19:09.357 --> 19:12.736
you porpoise-raping
piece of shit.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.445
I'm Reggie!
Of course I can do it!

19:14.529 --> 19:16.073
Right on!
He's the Reg, boys!

19:16.155 --> 19:17.824
I told ya.

19:17.908 --> 19:19.450
Bubbles:
Yeah, but see,
"porpoise-raping".

19:19.534 --> 19:21.745
Why do you need
to call him that?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.246
It's kind of funny.
I mean,

19:23.329 --> 19:24.455
something in the
ocean probably
does rape them.

19:24.539 --> 19:26.207
Octopusses,
fucking...

19:26.290 --> 19:28.418
Octopusses don't
rape porpoises!

19:28.501 --> 19:30.003
starfish...
How the fuck

19:30.087 --> 19:31.254
could a starfish
rape a porpoise?

19:31.337 --> 19:32.672
Salamanders
probably do.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.799
They don't live
in the ocean, but...

19:34.883 --> 19:37.260
Okay, dude,
minor setback.

19:37.343 --> 19:38.595
Not a big deal, man.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.221
We just get it
up there.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.099
I've seen worse.
It's spilled
a little, but...

19:42.181 --> 19:43.600
Oh, fuck,
it's all over me.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.476
Well, we'll just put
it back in, dude. Look.

19:45.560 --> 19:47.311
It's a good thing
you found it, man.

19:47.395 --> 19:48.939
Hey, I don't remember
it being so white

19:49.022 --> 19:50.648
and sticky and shit.

19:50.732 --> 19:51.900
Let's get it
back on the truck

19:51.983 --> 19:53.110
and get it back
to the park.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.527
(Straining)
Yeah, hoist
it up, dude.

19:54.611 --> 19:56.279
(Straining)
All right.
Ahh, fuck... okay.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.781
You raise your end.
You go first.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.240
Okay, argh...
Yeah, well, put it...

19:59.323 --> 20:01.284
Oh, wait, no...
Okay...
Shit.

20:01.367 --> 20:04.370
(Indistinct muttering,
grunting)

20:04.454 --> 20:05.956
Ugh!
Oh, jeez,

20:06.039 --> 20:07.206
fuck's sakes!
Okay, that's
all right, dude.

20:07.290 --> 20:09.250
Here, do it again.
Okay, up.

20:09.333 --> 20:10.501
(Straining)
Yeah, I got it.

20:10.585 --> 20:13.296
Let's go.
(Both panting)

20:13.379 --> 20:15.465
Oh, perfect, dude.
Okay.
Yeah, man.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.134
Make sure you
strap it down good
this time, eh?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.427
Great idea.
All right.

20:23.431 --> 20:25.224
Bubbles:
There, Dougie,
you take that.

20:25.308 --> 20:26.810
Just feed them
water for now, guys.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.311
We're going to be
over, we'll teach you

20:28.394 --> 20:29.813
exactly the formulas
to use, all right?

20:29.896 --> 20:31.397
She's got two.
There you go.

20:31.481 --> 20:32.857
And remember, the
bigger the plants,

20:32.941 --> 20:34.442
the more money
you're going to make.

20:34.525 --> 20:35.652
That's the last
of 'em. Right on.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.070
This tomato plant
don't look right.

20:37.154 --> 20:38.488
That's 'cause
it's a special, uh,

20:38.571 --> 20:39.823
tomato plant
from Italy.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.240
They grow a lot
bigger there.
Oh, yeah.

20:41.324 --> 20:43.701
It's a special tomato
plant from<i> Jamaica.</i>

20:43.785 --> 20:46.329
Huh?
It's still fucked.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.498
You're fucked.
(Horn honking)

20:48.581 --> 20:50.000
Speaking of fucked.

20:51.126 --> 20:52.543
Cory:
What's up, dudes?

20:52.627 --> 20:55.005
Ricky:
It's about fucking time!
Yo!

20:55.088 --> 20:56.297
Boom! Look at that.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.841
Your fucking brain's
about the size

20:57.924 --> 20:59.676
of fucking tiny little
birds, you know that?

20:59.759 --> 21:01.052
Yo, check it though.

21:01.136 --> 21:02.345
Look.

21:02.428 --> 21:04.181
What the fuck
does that say?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.016
"Power braking fluid".

21:06.099 --> 21:07.851
Power steering fluid!
It eats through
brake lines.

21:07.934 --> 21:10.353
You almost had us
fucking killed,
you idiot!

21:10.436 --> 21:11.604
Ricky.
What?

21:11.688 --> 21:13.439
The nutrient company
change the formula?

21:13.523 --> 21:15.441
When did it start
looking like
vanilla pudding?

21:15.525 --> 21:16.693
What the fuck?

21:16.776 --> 21:17.944
Why is it
that colour?

21:19.362 --> 21:20.738
What the fuck is that?

21:22.782 --> 21:24.201
Bubbles:
Well, Ricky, don't...
That's not it!

21:24.283 --> 21:26.036
What the fuck is that?

21:26.119 --> 21:27.787
Who the fuck is this?

21:29.914 --> 21:31.374
(Door opening, closing)
Fuck!

21:31.457 --> 21:32.959
Who the fuck...?
Man:
Which one

21:33.043 --> 21:35.545
of you cocksuckers
is Jacob?
(Rifle clicking)

21:35.628 --> 21:37.672
There's no fucking
Jacob here there,
flamingo tits!

21:37.755 --> 21:40.050
I found this on the
ground at my farm

21:40.133 --> 21:42.719
and I'm missing a
very valuable barrel.

21:42.802 --> 21:44.554
Julian: Whoopdee shit,
you found something
on the ground.

21:44.637 --> 21:46.181
What the fuck is it?
Hey, dude,

21:46.264 --> 21:48.225
that's your hospital
bracelet, Jacob.

21:48.307 --> 21:49.893
You are the son
of a bitch

21:49.976 --> 21:51.228
that robbed me?
We're not fucking
around here, bud!

21:51.310 --> 21:52.603
Where is it, boy?

21:52.687 --> 21:54.397
Look, none of us
robbed from you, okay?

21:54.480 --> 21:56.649
So get in your truck
and get the fuck
out of our park!

21:56.733 --> 21:59.236
Oh, really, huh?
There it is, Harold.
Load it on the truck.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.695
No, no, no.
You're not fucking
taking that.

22:00.778 --> 22:02.739
We fucking need it.
Oh, we are taking it!

22:02.822 --> 22:05.491
And I'll shoot every
fucking one of you
if I have to!

22:05.575 --> 22:07.660
We'll fucking shoot you
too! I fucking love
shooting people!

22:07.744 --> 22:09.079
Bubbles:
Ricky! Ricky, just wait!
Come on!

22:09.162 --> 22:10.454
Hang the fuck on!

22:10.538 --> 22:11.915
What if we just pay
you for it, okay?

22:11.998 --> 22:13.457
And we'll forget
this ever happened.

22:13.541 --> 22:14.959
Oh no, French guys,

22:15.043 --> 22:16.294
but you don't like
the kind of people

22:16.377 --> 22:18.713
that got 50 grand
lying around.

22:18.796 --> 22:20.798
<i>50 grand?</i> For what?
For that shit?

22:20.882 --> 22:24.135
Well, that's its value
when it's acquired by hand.

22:24.219 --> 22:27.471
It's $280 at the
fucking hydroponics
store, you criminal.

22:27.555 --> 22:30.183
Wait a second.
Hand-acquired?

22:30.267 --> 22:32.060
What the fuck
is this stuff?

22:32.143 --> 22:34.478
Bull semen!
What the fuck did
you think it was?

22:34.562 --> 22:36.106
Bull semen!
(Retching)

22:36.189 --> 22:37.815
Man:
Yeah, it's not just any
ordinary bull semen.

22:37.899 --> 22:39.150
This is grade A,

22:39.234 --> 22:42.320
100% organic,
hand-tossed

22:42.403 --> 22:44.948
liquid fucking gold!
Okay.

22:45.031 --> 22:47.700
(Violent retching)
Look, there's been
a huge mix-up here.

22:47.784 --> 22:49.702
I sent these
two idiots out

22:49.786 --> 22:52.289
to pick up a fucking barrel
of fertilizer in a barn.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.664
They obviously went
to the wrong one

22:53.748 --> 22:54.999
'cause they're dumb.

22:55.083 --> 22:56.459
Ricky:
We had no idea, man.
Just take it

22:56.542 --> 22:58.128
and get it the fuck
out of here, please!

22:58.211 --> 22:59.963
Oh, we're going
to take it out
of here, all right.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.589
Then we're going
to come back
with the cops

23:01.672 --> 23:03.758
and sort this out.
You don't need
to call the cops!

23:03.841 --> 23:05.343
We're giving it
to you back, man.

23:05.426 --> 23:07.137
It's down a couple
of gallons

23:07.220 --> 23:08.263
and these
tired old hands

23:08.346 --> 23:09.722
ain't going to be
able to top it up.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.557
Blisters healed
just a few days ago.

23:11.641 --> 23:13.476
Ricky:
Stop fucking
talking about it!

23:13.559 --> 23:15.436
What if I give you
these guys to jack
off your bulls?

23:15.519 --> 23:17.438
They'll top it up,
we'll be cool.

23:17.521 --> 23:19.690
Uhh, I don't know.
It's, uh...

23:19.774 --> 23:21.609
(Retching continues)

23:21.692 --> 23:23.194
...it's pretty hard
work, you know.

23:23.278 --> 23:24.487
No, no,
they can do it.

23:24.570 --> 23:25.989
They can do it,
believe me.

23:26.072 --> 23:27.991
They've had lots
of experience
in that field.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.368
I'll through a few
crates of lobsters
in there too.

23:30.451 --> 23:32.578
Lobsters, huh?
Crates?

23:32.662 --> 23:33.830
Uh...

23:33.913 --> 23:35.165
Come on, man.

23:35.248 --> 23:37.875
Yeah, well...
yeah, okay.

23:37.959 --> 23:39.752
Oh, yes, I...
Yeah, yeah, okay.

23:39.836 --> 23:41.171
Yeah, we got a deal,
We got a deal.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.006
All right.
Harold,

23:43.089 --> 23:44.341
load the load
of load.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.343
Cory, Jacob,
help him with
the load.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.928
What?
Help him out with
the fucking load.

23:49.012 --> 23:50.388
Ricky, are you
all right?

23:50.471 --> 23:51.681
Ricky! Ricky!

23:51.764 --> 23:54.017
Do not wipe
your lips on me.

23:54.100 --> 23:56.102
How big of a dollop
did you put on
your tongue?

23:56.186 --> 23:58.229
(Groaning)

23:58.313 --> 24:00.357
Oh, my fuck.
Not fucking right now.

24:00.481 --> 24:03.151
What's the commotion here?
None of your fucking
business, Randy.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.069
Julian, what the frig
are you doing here?

24:05.153 --> 24:07.364
You know the rules.
I want you to leave
the park immediately.

24:07.446 --> 24:08.906
Relax, Randy,
I'm just visiting.

24:08.990 --> 24:10.783
Right, Julian.
Just visiting.

24:10.867 --> 24:12.369
Well, you better be.

24:12.451 --> 24:13.744
I'm not afraid
of you anymore,

24:13.828 --> 24:15.872
tough guy!
What the fuck,
Randy?

24:15.955 --> 24:17.707
You've got one
hour, Julian!

24:17.790 --> 24:19.542
Ooooh!

24:19.625 --> 24:22.545
When the fuck did
he start acting so
hard wearing a shirt?

24:22.628 --> 24:25.256
Bubbles:
The same day he started
wearing blue bags.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.799
Fucking cop wannabe.

24:26.883 --> 24:30.553
Barb & Lahey:
(Imitating ducks
quacking, laughing)

24:32.638 --> 24:34.224
Hey, guys!

24:34.307 --> 24:36.393
There's my little man.
Barb:
Hi!

24:36.475 --> 24:38.061
Thank you so much
for looking after him.

24:38.144 --> 24:39.729
Oh!
He's really growing
attached to you guys.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.398
Oh, my gosh,
it's no problem.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.441
We're growing attached
to him. He's so gorgeous!

24:43.524 --> 24:45.902
(Chuckling)
I'm going to
miss you so much

24:45.985 --> 24:47.570
next week
when I'm away,

24:47.653 --> 24:49.906
but I will bring you back
a lovely treat, okay?

24:49.989 --> 24:51.699
Don't worry,
little Mo.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.743
Uncle Jimmy will
still be around
to play with you.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.203
Yes, I will! Mm!

24:55.286 --> 24:56.954
Okay, Mo,
wave bye.

24:57.038 --> 24:58.915
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm coming with you.
Come on.

24:58.998 --> 25:01.792
I'm going to get
my little fix of Mo

25:01.876 --> 25:03.794
before I go.

25:03.878 --> 25:05.171
Come on, let's go.

25:05.255 --> 25:07.090
(Chuckling)
See you, Mo.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.759
Say bye.
Say, "Bye,
Uncle Jimmy!"

25:12.345 --> 25:14.472
Randy:
Hey, guys.
Hey, Randy.

25:14.555 --> 25:16.933
Hey, Mo, how's
it going, buddy?
Say hi.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.184
Randy:
Good to see ya.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.313
We've got to take
Julian and Ricky
down, sir.

25:22.397 --> 25:24.482
Julian?
Yeah, he was
just here.

25:24.607 --> 25:26.776
What?
There were two
farmers with guns,

25:26.859 --> 25:29.779
a barrel of something
big and expensive.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.948
Something big
is going down.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.824
You could
talk to Barb,

25:33.908 --> 25:36.453
convince her to
let Julian move
back to the park

25:36.535 --> 25:39.456
and then we could
take them all
down at once.

25:39.538 --> 25:40.831
It's not going
to happen, Randy.

25:40.915 --> 25:44.043
Oh, you get to decide
just like that, do you?

25:44.127 --> 25:46.129
Yeah...
Well, maybe... maybe
I'll decide then

25:46.212 --> 25:47.964
this isn't going
to happen either.
Randy, Randy, Randy,

25:48.047 --> 25:50.383
Randy, come on now.
Just relax, bud.

25:52.218 --> 25:54.345
Okay, we'll talk.
Okay?

25:55.805 --> 25:56.973
Okay.

25:57.056 --> 25:58.224
You go in and
start supper.

25:58.308 --> 26:00.226
I'll clean up.

26:00.310 --> 26:01.811
Thanks for
listening, sir.

26:07.442 --> 26:08.692
(Sigh)

26:08.776 --> 26:11.570
My sexy Julian
back in the park, huh?

26:16.367 --> 26:17.868
This is pretty much
it, Julian.

26:17.952 --> 26:19.829
Everything comes
in there, you know.

26:19.912 --> 26:21.498
Sliced and diced;

26:21.580 --> 26:22.832
puréed and crushed;

26:22.915 --> 26:24.834
over to the spiceland

26:24.917 --> 26:26.085
for my proprietary
blend.

26:26.169 --> 26:27.837
She gets cooked off
in the boiler,

26:27.920 --> 26:29.339
goes in there,

26:29.422 --> 26:31.674
pumped up into
the saucinator,

26:31.757 --> 26:33.510
out into the bottle
and the capping
department.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.095
It's a pretty fucking
streamlined operation.

26:36.179 --> 26:38.181
No, man, it's pretty
fucking impressive.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.183
No, I know.
So, what's the
profit margin

26:40.266 --> 26:42.519
on each fucking jar?

26:42.601 --> 26:44.687
(Sigh)
You see, profit
margin...

26:44.770 --> 26:46.772
You've got to
know that, man.
I know.

26:46.856 --> 26:48.566
And you know
all that stuff

26:48.649 --> 26:50.193
and that's why you
should be living here

26:50.276 --> 26:51.777
at the park with me.
(Sigh)

26:51.861 --> 26:53.237
Just knowing
words like that,

26:53.321 --> 26:54.697
I'd probably
make more money.

26:54.780 --> 26:56.366
I know,
but I can't, okay?

26:56.449 --> 26:58.409
I've got a good
thing going on at
the container, man.

26:58.493 --> 27:00.161
It's peaceful
out there.

27:00.244 --> 27:02.372
There's no stress
on the ocean, man,
it's beautiful.

27:02.455 --> 27:04.374
(Door opening)
Ricky:
Hey, boys.

27:04.457 --> 27:07.293
Hey, Ricky.
Bubs, I need
a little favour.

27:07.377 --> 27:09.587
Coolnow obviously
can't be around
Jacob any more and...

27:09.670 --> 27:10.963
Stop right there, Ricky.

27:11.047 --> 27:12.549
Don't say another word.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.925
You tell Jacob to put
him on a spaceship

27:15.009 --> 27:17.178
and they can fly
up to Jacob's house
at the North Star.

27:17.261 --> 27:18.929
He's not staying here.

27:19.013 --> 27:21.015
Trin and Mo can't
move 'cause of a
fucking puppy dog,

27:21.098 --> 27:22.892
and we can't get
rid of him, Mo loves
the little bastard.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.894
Well, I'm putting my
foot down, Ricky, 100%.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.146
There's two things
that dogs don't
mix with:

27:27.230 --> 27:28.856
kitties and Bubbles.

27:28.939 --> 27:31.442
Oh, like the...
the ones you blow
with bubble gum?

27:31.526 --> 27:33.694
No! Me, Bubbles. Me.

27:33.777 --> 27:35.363
Why didn't you
say "me"?

27:35.446 --> 27:37.740
Because I sometimes
refer to myself in
the third person.

27:37.823 --> 27:40.451
It's a thing I do.
That's confusing.

27:40.535 --> 27:42.119
Anyway, it's only
for a little while.

27:42.203 --> 27:43.913
It's nothing big
deal, right?
One day or so.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.498
He's not staying,
Ricky...
I know.

27:45.582 --> 27:47.417
I've got to say good night
to Mo, hold him
for a minute.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.626
Ricky!
Thanks, buddy.
Love ya.

27:48.709 --> 27:50.253
You're a good friend.
(Heavy sigh)

27:50.336 --> 27:52.046
This is unbelievable.

27:52.129 --> 27:53.756
Look at this now:
bull semen,

27:53.839 --> 27:55.091
fucking dope clones,
shoot-outs,

27:55.174 --> 27:56.593
and now this,

27:56.675 --> 27:59.095
me looking after a fucking
wrangley old mutt.

27:59.178 --> 28:00.804
It looks a hotdog
with hair on it.

28:00.888 --> 28:03.140
Bubs, things got
a little fucky today,

28:03.224 --> 28:04.683
but you've got
to be positive.

28:04.767 --> 28:06.060
How good is it
to have all of us

28:06.143 --> 28:07.520
back together
again, huh?

28:07.604 --> 28:08.771
Huh?
I don't know.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.356
Oh, come on, man.

28:10.440 --> 28:13.443
Scale of one to ten,
how good does it feel?

28:13.526 --> 28:14.777
Come on,
tiddle-iddle-iddle-
iddle-iddle!

28:14.860 --> 28:16.987
Mmm.
Come on.

28:17.071 --> 28:19.698
Mm...
a million billion.

28:21.200 --> 28:22.535
That's how I feel.

28:22.619 --> 28:24.454
Hey, little buddy.
He's fucking cute, man.

28:24.537 --> 28:26.539
He's not cute.

28:26.623 --> 28:28.666
He's got a big,
long nose.

28:28.749 --> 28:31.127
Nobody likes that.

28:31.210 --> 28:33.129
(Lips smacking)

28:33.212 --> 28:35.339
Nobody likes those
cute little ears

28:35.423 --> 28:37.133
and little tongue.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.552
He's fucking cute, man.
I don't care what you say.

28:39.636 --> 28:42.639
(Theme music)

29:24.096 --> 29:26.516
(Seabirds squawking)

29:37.485 --> 29:41.864
Fish:
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

29:41.947 --> 29:45.117
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

29:48.454 --> 29:49.955
(Whisper)
<i>Fuck.</i>

29:50.039 --> 29:52.041
(Light clicks off)
<i>Fuck off.</i>
