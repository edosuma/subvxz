00:52.800 --> 00:55.291
Captain wants you
to keep 500 feet.

00:55.369 --> 00:58.827
Maneuvering, Control.
Come in shallow to 500 feet.

01:00.140 --> 01:03.109
- Keep 500 feet.
- Keep 500 feet, sir.

01:34.675 --> 01:36.609
What the hell's going on, Eddie?

01:38.612 --> 01:41.604
Emergency stations.
Captain to the control room.

01:43.550 --> 01:45.984
- What's going on?
- Number five bulkhead shut down.

01:46.053 --> 01:48.146
- Control, Maneuvering.
- Control, Captain.

01:48.222 --> 01:51.123
I'm losing electrical frequency.
I'll have to break down the system.

01:51.191 --> 01:52.522
Control, Sound Room.

01:56.764 --> 01:59.824
Total loss of power
on all sonar sets.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.061
Surface.
Blow forward, blow aft, full ahead.

02:02.136 --> 02:04.297
Full rise on both planes.
Raise the search periscope.

02:25.225 --> 02:26.658
Oh, my God.

02:26.727 --> 02:28.854
Yeah, put him through.

02:28.929 --> 02:30.362
Good morning, sir.

02:31.231 --> 02:33.165
No, First Sea Lord.

02:33.233 --> 02:36.498
There's been no contact
with Ranger yet, sir.

02:36.570 --> 02:39.266
No sightings,
no distress signals, sir.

02:40.507 --> 02:42.805
It looks very much like it.

02:42.876 --> 02:44.810
Yes, of course I will, sir.

02:48.315 --> 02:50.783
We've lost one
of our nuclear submarines.

02:54.755 --> 02:57.121
What?

02:57.191 --> 03:01.218
The submarine Potempkin
disappeared without trace?

03:03.330 --> 03:05.924
What a catastrophe, Comrade Chairman.

03:07.534 --> 03:10.094
Yes, of course.
I'll assign our best agent immediately.

03:14.041 --> 03:17.977
- Rubelvitch, where is Agent XXX?
- On leave, General.

03:18.045 --> 03:20.946
At a people's rest
and recuperation center.

03:31.558 --> 03:33.492
It's been a wonderful weekend.

03:35.062 --> 03:37.428
- I shall never forget it.
- Nor will I.

03:37.497 --> 03:39.431
When can we meet again?

03:40.534 --> 03:42.798
As soon as my mission
is accomplished.

03:46.106 --> 03:49.542
I must go.
I have to be in Austria tonight.

03:49.610 --> 03:51.043
Five more minutes.

03:57.818 --> 04:01.276
Agent XXX.
Calling Agent XXX.

04:01.355 --> 04:03.721
You will report to headquarters
immediately.

04:03.790 --> 04:06.725
Agent XXX,
acknowledge and verify.

04:14.635 --> 04:19.163
This is XXX.
Message received and understood.

04:19.238 --> 04:23.369
Yes, Mr. Prime Minister. I understand
the gravity of the situation.

04:24.778 --> 04:27.440
Yes, I'll put our best man on it
at once.

04:28.548 --> 04:29.981
Good-bye.

04:37.357 --> 04:39.484
Moneypenny, where is 007?

04:39.559 --> 04:41.618
He's on a mission, sir,
in Austria.

04:41.695 --> 04:44.391
Tell him to pull out,
immediately.

04:52.706 --> 04:57.336
Oh, James,
I cannot find the words.

04:59.112 --> 05:01.239
Let me try
and enlarge your vocabulary.

05:25.505 --> 05:26.938
What's happened?

05:27.007 --> 05:29.809
- Where are you going?
- Sorry, darling. Something came up.

05:35.514 --> 05:38.108
But, James, I need you.

05:38.184 --> 05:39.617
So does England.

05:49.261 --> 05:51.821
He has just left.

05:51.897 --> 05:53.558
Over and out.

05:53.632 --> 05:56.362
Message received. We are waiting.
Over and out.

06:08.881 --> 06:10.314
Now.

08:11.002 --> 08:15.405
Nobody does it better

08:18.309 --> 08:23.406
Makes me feel sad for the rest

08:25.717 --> 08:29.084
Nobody does it

08:29.154 --> 08:33.784
Half as good as you

08:33.857 --> 08:38.090
Baby, you're the best

08:40.664 --> 08:43.964
I wasn't looking

08:44.034 --> 08:46.765
But somehow you found me

08:47.939 --> 08:49.930
I tried to hide from

08:50.008 --> 08:54.445
Your love light

08:54.512 --> 08:58.039
But like heaven above me

08:58.116 --> 09:01.051
The spy who loved me

09:01.119 --> 09:06.352
Is keeping all my secrets safe tonight

09:08.259 --> 09:13.856
And nobody does it better

09:16.167 --> 09:18.761
Though sometimes I wish

09:18.836 --> 09:22.067
Someone could

09:23.341 --> 09:26.833
Nobody does it

09:26.911 --> 09:30.005
Quite the way you do

09:31.349 --> 09:35.376
Why do you have to be so good

09:37.989 --> 09:41.220
The way that you hold me

09:41.292 --> 09:45.126
Whenever you hold me

09:45.196 --> 09:47.357
There's some kind of magic

09:47.432 --> 09:52.267
Inside you

09:52.337 --> 09:55.500
That keeps me from running

09:55.573 --> 09:58.371
But just keep it coming

09:58.443 --> 10:03.938
How'd you learn
to do the things you do

10:29.374 --> 10:32.434
Baby, baby

10:32.510 --> 10:35.206
Baby, you're the best

10:48.426 --> 10:50.587
Send in Agent XXX.

10:59.869 --> 11:02.337
You sent for me, Comrade General.

11:02.405 --> 11:06.865
Good morning. Major Amasova,
we are facing a most delicate situation.

11:06.943 --> 11:10.572
Our nuclear submarine Potempkin
has disappeared.

11:10.647 --> 11:12.080
Sabotage?

11:12.148 --> 11:15.379
That is for you to find out.
We have one lead:

11:15.451 --> 11:17.385
A connection in Cairo.

11:17.453 --> 11:18.886
You leave tonight.

11:18.955 --> 11:20.650
Will that be all?

11:23.159 --> 11:25.093
There is one more thing.

11:27.597 --> 11:32.125
I regret to inform you, Major, that
Agent Sergei Borzov has been killed.

11:36.372 --> 11:40.103
On a mission at Berngarten
in the Austrian Alps.

11:42.545 --> 11:44.877
A tragic occurrence,
Comrade General.

11:44.947 --> 11:47.541
It had not escaped our notice
that you and Agent Borzov...

11:47.617 --> 11:51.053
had been more than friends
for some time.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.553
I'm very sorry.

11:52.622 --> 11:54.522
How did he die?

11:54.590 --> 11:56.080
We haven't all the details yet.

11:56.159 --> 12:00.289
It appears he'd become involved
in a British Secret Service operation.

12:01.431 --> 12:04.127
Please keep me informed,
Comrade General.

12:04.200 --> 12:06.134
I should very much like to meet...

12:06.202 --> 12:08.568
whoever was responsible
for his death.

12:35.765 --> 12:37.494
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

12:37.567 --> 12:39.501
- Good morning, 007.
- Hello, Q.

12:39.569 --> 12:42.504
- Mission successful?
- On and off.

12:42.572 --> 12:44.904
- Good morning, Commander.
- Good morning, sir.

12:44.974 --> 12:47.568
- Captain Forsyth.
- Sir.

12:47.643 --> 12:49.167
Commander Bond, sir.

12:49.245 --> 12:51.839
- Mr. Fredrick Gray, Minister of Defense.
- Good morning, Commander.

12:51.914 --> 12:54.883
Admiral Hargreaves,
Flag Officer, Submarines.

12:54.951 --> 12:57.351
- Ark Royal, wasn't it?
- Yes, sir.

12:57.420 --> 13:00.651
- I believe M told you about this.
- Yes, Minister.

13:00.723 --> 13:02.657
Over here, please, gentlemen.

13:30.453 --> 13:32.944
This, I take it, is Ranger's
prearranged coastal patrol area.

13:33.022 --> 13:36.856
- That's right.
- How many people knew this course?

13:36.926 --> 13:38.655
Admiral Hargreaves, myself...

13:38.728 --> 13:40.923
and Talbot, the submarine captain.

13:49.672 --> 13:51.105
Good God.

13:54.343 --> 13:56.277
Where did this come from?

13:56.345 --> 13:58.575
I'm sorry, Benson.
For the moment, that's top secret.

13:58.648 --> 14:01.879
I see, sir.
Commander, this tracing means...

14:01.951 --> 14:06.581
that the Russians can track our nuclear
submarines underwater and sink them.

14:06.656 --> 14:09.420
- I believe it does.
- How could they? It's impossible.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.827
It's quite simple.

14:12.895 --> 14:16.729
Heat signature recognition,
most likely.

14:16.799 --> 14:18.892
- With your permission, Minister?
- Yes, of course.

14:18.968 --> 14:20.560
Thank you.

14:20.636 --> 14:23.503
We already know that satellites
with infrared heat sensors...

14:23.573 --> 14:26.838
can detect a nuclear missile
in flight by its tail fire.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.240
Well?

14:28.311 --> 14:31.747
Someone can now locate
a submerged nuclear submarine...

14:31.814 --> 14:36.251
in exactly the same way,
by its wake.

14:36.319 --> 14:40.449
That means they can totally undermine
our Western defense strategy.

14:40.523 --> 14:41.956
Yes, it looks like it.

14:43.392 --> 14:45.360
Where did we get that tracing, Freddie?

14:45.428 --> 14:47.692
Cairo, diplomatic bag.

14:47.763 --> 14:51.790
Somebody got the plans of that tracking
system and is trying to sell them.

14:51.868 --> 14:54.701
They sent us that tracing as proof
that it's genuine.

14:54.770 --> 14:57.739
Then, if there is a deal to be made,
the price will be high.

14:57.807 --> 15:00.935
"High"? Astronomical.

15:01.010 --> 15:04.969
That missing submarine
had 16 Polaris missiles aboard.

15:06.749 --> 15:08.410
We have a contact in Egypt?

15:08.484 --> 15:11.920
M will give you the details.
You leave tonight.

15:22.098 --> 15:24.965
Dr. Bechmann
and Professor Markovitz.

15:25.034 --> 15:26.626
Thank you.

15:26.702 --> 15:30.194
Gentlemen, now that the moment
has come to bid you farewell...

15:30.273 --> 15:33.538
I congratulate both you, Doctor,
and you, Professor...

15:33.609 --> 15:36.669
on your brilliant work
in the development...

15:36.746 --> 15:39.112
of the submarine tracking system.

15:39.181 --> 15:42.275
Thanks primarily to you,
I'm happy to say...

15:42.351 --> 15:45.047
that the first phase
of our operation...

15:45.121 --> 15:47.555
has met with considerable success.

15:47.623 --> 15:49.818
I have instructed my assistant...

15:49.892 --> 15:51.655
to have paid into your...

15:51.727 --> 15:53.627
Swiss bank account...

15:53.696 --> 15:57.223
the sum of $10 million each.

15:57.300 --> 15:59.461
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you, indeed.

15:59.535 --> 16:03.130
And that, I think,
concludes our business.

16:03.940 --> 16:06.204
Before you go, however...

16:06.275 --> 16:08.869
I very much regret to inform you...

16:08.945 --> 16:10.845
that a dangerous development...

16:10.913 --> 16:13.814
has recently been brought
to my notice.

16:13.883 --> 16:16.852
Someone has been attempting
to sell the plans...

16:16.919 --> 16:19.217
of our tracking project...

16:19.288 --> 16:21.222
to competing world powers.

16:21.290 --> 16:24.782
Someone intimately associated
with the project.

16:26.162 --> 16:29.325
My dear, it would be more seemly
if you left us.

16:30.399 --> 16:31.832
Thank you.

17:00.863 --> 17:04.060
It was you
who betrayed me.

17:04.133 --> 17:06.896
You had access
to all the information.

17:06.969 --> 17:09.961
Now you will pay the penalty.

17:33.896 --> 17:38.333
Once again, gentlemen,
my most profound thanks.

18:58.714 --> 19:00.739
- Sandor.
- Yes, sir.

19:04.353 --> 19:05.786
Jaws.

19:07.556 --> 19:09.490
I'm assigning you the task...

19:09.558 --> 19:11.788
of recovering the microfilm copy...

19:11.861 --> 19:13.795
of the tracking system.

19:15.097 --> 19:18.658
Sandor, you will go with him.
Obey him.

19:18.734 --> 19:23.103
Every person who even comes into contact
with that microfilm...

19:23.172 --> 19:25.333
is to be eliminated.

19:39.788 --> 19:42.313
Stand by for helicopter takeoff.

19:42.391 --> 19:45.758
All personnel,
clear the flight deck platform.

20:16.492 --> 20:18.619
Cancel transfer of $20 million.

20:18.694 --> 20:22.824
Inform next of kin
that a tragic accident...

20:22.898 --> 20:25.731
has resulted in the death
of Professor Markovitz...

20:25.801 --> 20:27.792
and Dr. Bechmann.

20:29.205 --> 20:32.073
The funeral was at sea.

21:30.364 --> 21:33.299
May the peace of Allah
descend upon this magnificent abode...

21:33.367 --> 21:35.301
and allow a poor traveler
to enter.

21:35.369 --> 21:37.803
May the hospitality
of these miserable quarters...

21:37.872 --> 21:40.136
be sufficient
to your honored needs.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.539
James Bond, what a delightful surprise
after all these years.

21:49.617 --> 21:51.050
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

21:53.254 --> 21:58.214
I always wondered what you were gonna do
when you went down from Cambridge.

21:58.292 --> 22:01.352
I never had any problems knowing
what you were going to do, Hosein.

22:02.630 --> 22:05.895
We don't only have oil, you know.

22:05.966 --> 22:09.231
What can I offer you?
Sheep's eyes? Dates?

22:09.303 --> 22:12.363
- Vodka martini?
- Information.

22:12.439 --> 22:14.999
Who is putting the submarine
tracking system on the market?

22:16.644 --> 22:19.613
What a pity it is you insist
on being so businesslike.

22:28.722 --> 22:31.054
The gentleman you will
eventually be dealing with...

22:31.125 --> 22:32.854
is a certain Max Kalba.

22:32.927 --> 22:35.191
- "Eventually"?
- To reach Kalba...

22:35.262 --> 22:38.095
you must first make contact
with a man called Fekkesh.

22:38.165 --> 22:41.430
Aziz Fekkesh. I'll give you
his apartment address in Cairo.

22:41.502 --> 22:44.437
It's too late to meet him today.

22:44.505 --> 22:48.601
Can I persuade you to accept a bed
for the night?

22:49.977 --> 22:54.141
That's kind of you, Hosein,
but I really feel I...

23:01.488 --> 23:05.322
Are you quite sure I can't persuade you
to stay the night?

23:07.428 --> 23:09.988
When one is in Egypt...

23:10.064 --> 23:12.191
one should delve deeply
into its treasures.

24:32.946 --> 24:36.507
Yes. Oh, I'm sorry.
The door was open.

24:36.583 --> 24:39.381
Mr. Fekkesh is expecting me.
I phoned him.

24:39.453 --> 24:41.011
He asked me
to give you a message.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.817
He will be late.

24:42.890 --> 24:44.881
May I ask where he is?

24:44.958 --> 24:48.587
Mr. Fekkesh asked me to entertain you
while you are waiting.

24:48.662 --> 24:50.095
Really?

25:01.175 --> 25:03.336
Where is Fekkesh?

25:03.410 --> 25:05.571
You are very suspicious.

25:05.646 --> 25:07.841
I find I live much longer that way.

25:07.915 --> 25:09.849
Now where is he?

25:13.320 --> 25:18.257
If there's anything at all
you would like...

25:18.325 --> 25:22.591
I had lunch,
but I seem to have missed dessert.

25:30.137 --> 25:33.732
As urgent as my appointment is,
I'd hate him to walk in and surprise us.

25:33.807 --> 25:36.799
There is no danger of that.

25:38.178 --> 25:40.112
He'll be some time then?

25:41.415 --> 25:43.349
Is he meeting someone?

25:46.620 --> 25:48.815
I'm sorry,
I cannot answer that question.

25:48.889 --> 25:51.449
Oh, I think you can.

27:12.573 --> 27:14.097
Where's Fekkesh?

27:15.642 --> 27:17.075
Pyramids.

27:21.515 --> 27:22.948
What a helpful chap.

27:30.189 --> 27:33.090
You have come tonight
to the most fabulous...

27:33.159 --> 27:35.753
and celebrated place
in the world.

27:37.296 --> 27:42.324
Here on the Plateau of Giza
stands forever...

27:42.402 --> 27:44.427
the mightiest of human achievements.

27:46.906 --> 27:50.501
No traveler, emperor,
merchant or poet...

27:50.576 --> 27:53.773
has trodden on these sands...

27:53.846 --> 27:56.314
and not gasped in awe.

28:00.186 --> 28:03.713
The curtain of night
is about to rise...

28:03.790 --> 28:06.884
and disclose the stage on which...

28:06.959 --> 28:09.826
the drama of a civilization
took place.

28:12.665 --> 28:17.295
Those involved have been present
since the dawn of history...

28:17.370 --> 28:21.033
pitched stubbornly
against sand and wind.

28:24.243 --> 28:26.711
And the voice of the desert...

28:26.779 --> 28:28.713
has crossed the centuries.

28:40.359 --> 28:43.851
Excuse me, Major.
I'll be back in a moment.

28:53.206 --> 28:57.905
With each new dawn,
I see the sun god rise...

28:57.977 --> 29:00.639
on the far bank of the Nile.

29:49.128 --> 29:54.930
I am the faithful warden
at the foot of his lord.

29:55.001 --> 29:58.266
So faithful, so vigilant...

29:59.372 --> 30:00.930
so near him...

30:01.007 --> 30:04.408
that he gave me his face
for my own.

30:07.146 --> 30:10.411
I am a pharaoh's companion...

30:10.483 --> 30:15.352
and I am he, the pharaoh.

30:56.128 --> 30:57.686
This is the tomb of Cheops...

30:59.031 --> 31:03.832
Pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty
4,500 years ago.

31:03.903 --> 31:07.737
Here is the Great Pyramid
which he built...

31:07.807 --> 31:11.436
to defend himself against death.

31:34.934 --> 31:37.767
Here in the depths of his tomb...

31:37.837 --> 31:40.704
a servant of the king
awaits the call...

31:40.773 --> 31:44.470
to set out upon his journey
into eternity.

31:45.778 --> 31:48.303
Death lies waiting.

32:11.203 --> 32:12.636
Where is Fekkesh?

32:12.705 --> 32:14.866
With the pharaohs.

32:14.941 --> 32:17.842
- You killed him.
- No, he was dead when I found him.

32:42.802 --> 32:45.202
Hope you enjoyed the show.

32:45.271 --> 32:46.704
Good night.

33:24.311 --> 33:28.008
What an unexpected pleasure.
Welcome to the Mujaba Club.

33:28.081 --> 33:31.744
Buy you a drink,
Major Amasova?

33:31.818 --> 33:33.752
Or may I call you XXX?

33:34.888 --> 33:36.685
You know who I am.

33:36.756 --> 33:38.883
You made quite an impression.

33:38.958 --> 33:41.449
I'm sorry about Ivan and Boris.

33:41.528 --> 33:43.325
They exceeded their orders.

33:43.396 --> 33:46.024
Good staff is hard to find these days.

33:46.099 --> 33:47.794
Yes, sir?

33:47.867 --> 33:50.563
The lady will have a Bacardi
on the rocks.

33:50.637 --> 33:55.540
For the gentleman,
vodka martini, shaken not stirred.

33:56.376 --> 33:58.174
Touche.

33:58.244 --> 34:00.235
Commander James Bond.

34:00.313 --> 34:03.805
Recruited to the British Secret Service
from the Royal Navy.

34:03.883 --> 34:07.375
Licensed to kill, and has done so
on numerous occasions.

34:07.454 --> 34:10.217
Many lady friends,
but married only once.

34:10.290 --> 34:13.885
- Wife killed...
- All right, you've made your point.

34:15.462 --> 34:16.952
You're sensitive.

34:17.030 --> 34:18.463
About certain things, yes.

34:19.799 --> 34:21.664
Now, if you'll excuse me.

34:21.735 --> 34:23.998
Tragically,
I have a previous engagement.

34:24.070 --> 34:26.300
Happily enough, so do I.

34:26.373 --> 34:29.501
- Good-bye, Mr. Bond.
- Let's say au revoir.

34:29.576 --> 34:33.103
I have the oddest feeling
we'll be meeting again sometime.

34:42.155 --> 34:43.588
I'm looking for Mr. Kalba.

34:43.656 --> 34:46.386
Mr. Max Kalba is the owner
of the club, sir.

34:46.458 --> 34:47.891
Over there.

35:08.715 --> 35:13.743
Mr. Kalba,
my name is James Bond.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.720
What of it?

35:15.789 --> 35:18.781
You had an appointment
with Mr. Fekkesh.

35:18.858 --> 35:22.487
- Well?
- He won't be joining you.

35:33.606 --> 35:35.574
You have something
I'm interested in buying.

35:35.642 --> 35:38.076
Just a moment.
I would like to bid for it too.

35:41.548 --> 35:43.482
You forgot your drink.

35:44.751 --> 35:46.184
Thank you.

35:47.353 --> 35:50.481
It seems you have competition,
Mr. Bond.

35:50.557 --> 35:52.616
From where I sit...

35:52.692 --> 35:57.823
I fancy you will find the lady's figure
hard to match.

35:57.897 --> 36:01.458
Might the contestants be permitted
to view the article for sale?

36:12.078 --> 36:15.343
Well, now,
who will start the bidding?

36:17.417 --> 36:20.784
Mr. Kalba, sir, the telephone.
An urgent call.

36:20.854 --> 36:22.788
Excuse me.

36:29.762 --> 36:31.195
Pardon me.

36:40.707 --> 36:43.437
This is Kalba. Hello?

37:19.846 --> 37:21.370
Another?

38:35.588 --> 38:37.920
We've really got to stop
meeting like this.

38:39.359 --> 38:42.556
Kalba was called to the phone.
What happened?

38:43.963 --> 38:47.228
He was cut off, permanently.

38:47.300 --> 38:49.894
Where is the microfilm?

38:51.137 --> 38:52.570
Search me.

38:52.639 --> 38:55.301
He must have it,
or you wouldn't be here.

38:55.375 --> 38:56.808
You don't know who he is.

38:56.876 --> 38:59.970
- He's a professional killer.
- Called Jaws?

39:01.047 --> 39:03.345
Make no mistake, Mr. Bond...

39:03.416 --> 39:05.680
I want that microfilm...

39:05.752 --> 39:07.845
and I'm going to get it.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.854
Unless I get it first.

42:25.085 --> 42:26.985
Watch out!

42:38.998 --> 42:40.829
Don't move.

42:46.272 --> 42:49.503
Give me the microfilm.

43:33.386 --> 43:34.819
Egyptian builders.

44:03.650 --> 44:07.916
Sorry.
You're just too late.

44:09.389 --> 44:10.321
Give me the key!

44:12.492 --> 44:14.221
The key!

44:23.236 --> 44:24.396
Try the big one.

44:31.311 --> 44:33.245
Can you play any other tune?

44:37.250 --> 44:39.241
Let's try reverse.
That's backwards.

44:56.402 --> 44:58.336
Would you like me to drive?

45:06.379 --> 45:07.812
Women drivers.

45:07.881 --> 45:09.815
Quiet. Watch this.

45:15.154 --> 45:16.815
Shaken, but not stirred.

45:47.720 --> 45:51.349
That gorilla must have his teeth
fixed by a riveter.

45:51.424 --> 45:54.518
By the way,
thanks for deserting me back there.

45:54.594 --> 45:56.960
Every woman for herself.
Remember?

45:58.498 --> 46:02.025
Still, you did save my life.

46:02.101 --> 46:04.399
We all make mistakes, Mr. Bond.

46:39.539 --> 46:40.972
The cylinder head gasket.

47:28.888 --> 47:30.321
What did he say?

47:30.390 --> 47:33.291
He thinks we're overdressed,
but he'll take us to Cairo.

47:33.359 --> 47:34.792
Good.

48:35.120 --> 48:37.782
It's getting cold.

48:37.856 --> 48:40.654
Is there anything I can do
to warm you up?

48:40.725 --> 48:43.922
You don't have to worry about me.

48:43.995 --> 48:46.429
I went on a survival course
in Siberia.

48:46.498 --> 48:51.435
Yes, I believe a great number
of your countrymen do.

48:51.503 --> 48:52.970
What did they teach you?

48:53.038 --> 48:57.600
That it's very important
to have a positive mental attitude.

48:57.676 --> 49:00.167
Nothing more practical than that?

49:00.245 --> 49:03.612
Food is also very important.

49:05.183 --> 49:06.616
What else?

49:06.685 --> 49:11.213
When necessary,
shared bodily warmth.

49:13.258 --> 49:14.691
That's the part I like.

49:23.468 --> 49:25.561
Is this really what they do
in Siberia?

49:25.637 --> 49:29.403
Yes, but not how they do it.

49:41.987 --> 49:45.047
You're not trying to take advantage
of me, are you?

49:46.524 --> 49:48.719
The thought never crossed my mind.

49:57.268 --> 49:59.998
Just when it was getting interesting.

50:32.404 --> 50:33.837
Where's the girl?

51:47.145 --> 51:48.976
- Morning, Moneypenny.
- Good morning, James.

51:49.047 --> 51:51.174
Is he in?

51:51.249 --> 51:53.581
It must have been quite a party.

51:54.619 --> 51:56.177
Boring.

51:56.254 --> 51:57.744
I dropped off.

52:16.641 --> 52:18.734
Hello, James.
We've been expecting you.

52:18.810 --> 52:20.243
Good morning, sir.

52:20.311 --> 52:23.712
There's been a change in plan.

52:23.782 --> 52:28.242
You probably recognize my opposite
number in the KGB, General Gogol.

52:28.319 --> 52:32.255
I believe you're familiar
with Major Amasova.

52:32.323 --> 52:34.484
Enough to know which brand
of cigarette she smokes.

52:34.559 --> 52:36.186
Our respective governments...

52:36.261 --> 52:40.322
agreed to pool their resources to find
out what happened to our submarines.

52:41.332 --> 52:43.323
We have entered a new era...

52:43.401 --> 52:45.494
of Anglo-Soviet cooperation.

52:45.570 --> 52:48.971
As a sign of Russian good faith...

52:49.040 --> 52:51.008
I'm prepared to make available to you
the microfilm...

52:51.075 --> 52:53.543
recovered by Agent XXX.

52:53.611 --> 52:56.808
With considerable ease,
I might add.

52:57.715 --> 52:59.876
Don't bother. It's useless.

53:00.885 --> 53:02.819
I examined it on the boat.

53:04.122 --> 53:06.352
I assure you it is quite genuine.

53:06.424 --> 53:10.554
Except that the vital technical
information has been taken out.

53:10.628 --> 53:12.789
This was only intended
to whet our appetites.

53:17.969 --> 53:20.802
Maybe Q can make something
out of it.

53:39.424 --> 53:42.025
I want that ready
for Akmid's tea party.

53:43.359 --> 53:44.951
After you, Alexis.

53:45.028 --> 53:47.258
- After you, Miles.
- Thank you.

54:07.050 --> 54:08.984
That could bring tears
to your eyes.

54:17.560 --> 54:19.721
Everybody ready? Right.

54:21.264 --> 54:24.665
We're pretty certain that this drawing
was drafted in Italy.

54:24.734 --> 54:27.635
The size corresponds
with a Venetian octavo...

54:27.703 --> 54:30.137
and the typeface
is an Italian one.

54:30.206 --> 54:34.506
Now, note the slight upward stress
on the transversals.

54:34.577 --> 54:36.841
What's that mark there?

54:38.047 --> 54:40.311
Probably a show-through
of something...

54:40.383 --> 54:42.476
the drawing was resting on
when it was photographed.

54:42.552 --> 54:44.520
Must have been done in a hurry.

54:44.587 --> 54:47.317
- Can you enlarge it?
- Wait a minute.

54:50.560 --> 54:54.690
- "Oratory"? What is that?
- It's another word for chapel.

54:54.764 --> 54:57.824
Looks a bit like a bishop's mitre.

54:59.268 --> 55:01.065
It is a fish.

55:01.137 --> 55:03.935
That is the symbol
of the Stromberg Shipping Line.

55:04.006 --> 55:06.907
Karl Stromberg? He's one
of the richest men in the world.

55:06.976 --> 55:10.412
One of the principle capitalist
exploiters of the West, sir.

55:10.480 --> 55:12.573
So it's not "oratory,"
it's laboratory.

55:12.648 --> 55:15.378
Stromberg has a marine
research laboratory.

55:15.451 --> 55:16.975
On Corsica, I believe.

55:19.055 --> 55:20.488
Well done.

55:21.357 --> 55:23.348
Actually, it is in Sardinia.

55:28.097 --> 55:29.928
That's brilliant.

55:29.999 --> 55:32.866
I'm certain that two such
perceptive talents...

55:32.935 --> 55:36.132
will enjoy working together
in Sardinia...

55:36.205 --> 55:41.074
and that it will help to make
Anglo-Soviet cooperation a reality.

55:57.693 --> 55:59.126
Here we are.

56:01.197 --> 56:03.665
That was a delicious meal.
Thank you.

56:04.934 --> 56:07.300
I didn't realize you had
such a healthy appetite.

56:07.370 --> 56:08.962
Neither did I.

56:09.038 --> 56:12.201
It must be traveling by train.
I always enjoy it.

56:12.275 --> 56:14.835
I remember when...

56:14.911 --> 56:16.503
What do you remember?

56:16.579 --> 56:19.480
I was going to talk about a mission.

56:20.716 --> 56:22.479
Silly, isn't it?

56:22.552 --> 56:24.679
We can't talk,
and yet we're in the same business.

56:24.754 --> 56:28.690
- But with rival companies.
- We're not rivals at the moment.

56:30.693 --> 56:35.960
Then how about a nightcap,
on the company?

56:36.032 --> 56:37.465
My company.

56:37.533 --> 56:41.663
I'm very sorry. I have an idea
tomorrow is going to be a busy day.

56:41.737 --> 56:45.264
- I must sleep.
- Yes.

56:45.341 --> 56:48.777
- Well, then, sleep well.
- And you.

56:50.413 --> 56:51.846
Good night.

59:40.549 --> 59:42.744
What happened?

59:42.818 --> 59:45.252
He just dropped in
for a quick bite.

59:47.990 --> 59:49.423
You're hurt.

59:50.326 --> 59:51.918
Later.

59:51.994 --> 59:54.588
Let's worry about you.

59:54.663 --> 59:59.259
What was it they taught you
on that survival course?

59:59.335 --> 01:00:01.929
A positive mental attitude.

01:00:03.172 --> 01:00:05.606
And shared bodily warmth.

01:00:07.009 --> 01:00:09.443
Nothing about keeping out of drafts?

01:00:11.697 --> 01:00:14.291
Still enjoy traveling by train?

01:00:18.204 --> 01:00:20.138
You saved my life.

01:00:21.507 --> 01:00:22.974
Thank you, James.

01:00:23.843 --> 01:00:25.276
I'm sorry.

01:00:29.882 --> 01:00:32.407
Why don't you lie down
and let me look at it?

01:00:55.841 --> 01:00:58.435
What can we use for a bandage?

01:01:00.346 --> 01:01:01.779
How about this?

01:01:45.157 --> 01:01:46.590
Wait a moment.

01:02:06.844 --> 01:02:08.937
- Good morning, Major Boothroyd.
- Good morning, Major.

01:02:09.013 --> 01:02:11.948
Look what Q has brought for us.
Isn't it nice?

01:02:16.521 --> 01:02:18.455
Right.
Now pay attention, 007.

01:02:18.523 --> 01:02:22.687
Take great care of this equipment.
There are some special accessories...

01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:26.161
- Have I ever let you down?
- Frequently.

01:02:59.664 --> 01:03:02.030
You have a reservation for me.
The name is Sterling.

01:03:02.099 --> 01:03:05.796
Yes. Mr. And Mrs. Sterling.
Booked from Cairo.

01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:07.303
That's right.

01:03:07.371 --> 01:03:12.604
We have Suite A-5 for you;
a sitting room and two bedrooms.

01:03:14.145 --> 01:03:18.639
Moneypenny being over-efficient.
Do you have any messages for me?

01:03:25.022 --> 01:03:26.455
Thank you.

01:03:29.527 --> 01:03:32.894
Excellent.
We have been granted an audience.

01:03:59.557 --> 01:04:02.151
- Mr. Sterling?
- Yes.

01:04:02.226 --> 01:04:06.162
I'm Naomi.
Mr. Stromberg sent me to collect you.

01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:08.562
How do you do?
This is my wife...

01:04:08.633 --> 01:04:10.897
who also happens
to be my assistant.

01:04:10.968 --> 01:04:13.835
- You are on holiday here?
- Where there's an ocean...

01:04:13.904 --> 01:04:16.532
a marine biologist
is never on holiday.

01:04:16.607 --> 01:04:18.837
Can we offer you a drink
before we go?

01:04:18.909 --> 01:04:21.844
No, thank you.
Mr. Stromberg's a very busy man.

01:04:21.912 --> 01:04:23.846
His time is precious.

01:04:26.917 --> 01:04:28.578
What a handsome craft.

01:04:28.653 --> 01:04:30.348
Such lovely lines.

01:05:29.579 --> 01:05:31.012
Thank you.

01:05:32.081 --> 01:05:33.514
Very impressive.

01:05:38.721 --> 01:05:41.656
I wonder if you'd mind
showing my wife around...

01:05:41.724 --> 01:05:44.124
- while I'm with Mr. Stromberg.
- Of course.

01:05:44.193 --> 01:05:45.956
- This way.
- Thank you.

01:05:46.028 --> 01:05:48.690
Don't be a bother
to Naomi, darling.

01:05:48.764 --> 01:05:51.028
- I'll be back soon.
- By the way...

01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:54.126
Mr. Stromberg prefers
not to shake hands.

01:05:54.203 --> 01:05:57.138
- It's the third button.
- Thank you.

01:06:29.138 --> 01:06:31.072
Why do we seek
to conquer space...

01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:36.669
when seven-tenths of our universe
remains to be explored?

01:06:36.746 --> 01:06:38.680
The world beneath the sea.

01:06:38.748 --> 01:06:42.707
You seem to be well-equipped
to repair that oversight.

01:06:45.688 --> 01:06:50.489
My name is Robert Sterling.
It's very kind of you to receive me.

01:06:50.559 --> 01:06:55.053
It's always a pleasure to welcome
someone with a mutual interest.

01:06:57.867 --> 01:06:59.664
An extraordinary number
of rare species.

01:07:03.372 --> 01:07:06.307
You recognize that variety,
of course.

01:07:11.914 --> 01:07:13.347
Of course.

01:07:16.819 --> 01:07:18.946
Other fish avoid it.

01:07:19.021 --> 01:07:23.355
Those dorsal spines
are laden with venom.

01:07:24.326 --> 01:07:25.850
Handsome, but deadly.

01:07:27.897 --> 01:07:30.263
I see you know your subject.

01:07:31.567 --> 01:07:33.501
One tries.

01:07:33.569 --> 01:07:36.663
You have a remarkable
establishment here.

01:07:36.739 --> 01:07:39.833
I'm somewhat of a recluse.

01:07:39.909 --> 01:07:43.606
I wish to conduct my life
on my own terms...

01:07:43.679 --> 01:07:48.616
and in surroundings
with which I can identify.

01:07:48.684 --> 01:07:51.448
That is a privilege of wealth.

01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.785
Don't you miss the outside world?

01:07:55.858 --> 01:07:59.954
For me,
this is all the world.

01:08:01.197 --> 01:08:03.131
There's beauty...

01:08:04.533 --> 01:08:06.125
there's ugliness...

01:08:07.870 --> 01:08:09.804
and there is death.

01:08:11.373 --> 01:08:14.809
I think you will find
this interesting.

01:08:16.578 --> 01:08:18.308
An underwater city.

01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:20.473
Fascinating, isn't it?

01:08:20.549 --> 01:08:23.814
The only hope
for the future of mankind.

01:08:23.886 --> 01:08:25.319
We all have our dreams.

01:08:25.386 --> 01:08:29.823
No dream, Mr. Sterling.
Soon a reality.

01:08:31.993 --> 01:08:35.930
I'm afraid you must excuse me.
I have business to attend to.

01:08:37.066 --> 01:08:38.499
Good-bye.

01:08:38.567 --> 01:08:43.095
If we don't meet again,
I wish you luck with your research.

01:08:43.171 --> 01:08:45.935
Thank you. The brief glimpse
you've afforded me today...

01:08:46.008 --> 01:08:49.603
will only encourage me
to redouble my efforts.

01:08:49.678 --> 01:08:51.111
Good-bye.

01:09:07.029 --> 01:09:09.792
- How interesting.
- There you are.

01:09:09.865 --> 01:09:13.460
Darling, you should look at this model.
It's beautiful.

01:09:14.537 --> 01:09:16.129
This is the Liparus...

01:09:16.205 --> 01:09:18.537
the latest addition
to the Stromberg fleet.

01:09:18.607 --> 01:09:20.471
Launched nine months ago.

01:09:20.542 --> 01:09:23.511
At over a million tons,
it's the largest tanker in the world.

01:09:23.578 --> 01:09:27.481
- After the Karl Marx, of course.
- Really, darling?

01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:30.986
It's amazing the items of information
you store away.

01:09:36.892 --> 01:09:39.587
Were they the two on the train?

01:09:41.330 --> 01:09:43.924
James Bond...

01:09:43.999 --> 01:09:47.332
and the woman is Major Amasova,
a Russian agent.

01:09:49.505 --> 01:09:51.439
Let them get ashore...

01:09:54.009 --> 01:09:56.170
and then kill them.

01:10:09.692 --> 01:10:12.627
You're being very secretive.
Where are we going?

01:10:12.695 --> 01:10:15.459
I want another look
at that Stromberg laboratory.

01:10:15.531 --> 01:10:18.557
Do you think you could operate
the tracking system from there?

01:10:18.634 --> 01:10:20.124
It's possible.

01:10:20.202 --> 01:10:23.035
All we know for sure is that
two nuclear submarines are missing.

01:10:43.225 --> 01:10:45.318
What did you think
of that tanker model?

01:10:45.394 --> 01:10:48.420
There was something strange
about the design of her bows.

01:10:48.497 --> 01:10:50.055
I've asked M to check her out.

01:10:56.872 --> 01:11:00.569
- James, that motorcycle...
- Has been following us for a mile.

01:11:55.163 --> 01:11:57.427
All those feathers
and he still can't fly.

01:12:05.840 --> 01:12:07.432
Yes, I know. Don't tell me.

01:13:22.283 --> 01:13:24.513
You ever get the feeling
somebody doesn't like you?

01:14:46.634 --> 01:14:48.534
Can you swim?

01:15:17.899 --> 01:15:20.732
It's time we said good-bye
to an uninvited guest.

01:15:47.695 --> 01:15:49.287
Alone at last.

01:16:27.735 --> 01:16:29.669
That's what we've come to see.

01:17:40.474 --> 01:17:41.600
Brace yourself.

01:17:49.650 --> 01:17:51.083
Look!

01:18:35.996 --> 01:18:37.691
How did you know about that?

01:18:37.765 --> 01:18:40.996
I stole the blueprints
of this car two years ago.

01:18:43.671 --> 01:18:45.298
Do you think we can make it?

01:19:57.009 --> 01:19:58.943
Hello.

01:19:59.011 --> 01:20:03.505
- I have a message for you.
- I think you just delivered it.

01:20:05.518 --> 01:20:06.951
Thank you.

01:20:21.467 --> 01:20:23.958
Sorry to interrupt you...

01:20:24.036 --> 01:20:26.129
but I asked M for a list
of all the ports...

01:20:26.205 --> 01:20:28.469
the Stromberg tanker
had called at.

01:20:28.541 --> 01:20:30.133
What is the answer?

01:20:30.209 --> 01:20:32.143
In the nine months
since she was fitted out...

01:20:32.211 --> 01:20:35.203
there is no record of her
having put into port anywhere.

01:20:36.549 --> 01:20:39.985
That's very odd,
if it's true.

01:20:41.053 --> 01:20:43.749
We don't make mistakes
of that sort.

01:20:43.823 --> 01:20:46.087
You sound just like a Russian.

01:20:48.828 --> 01:20:52.764
I think we should take a closer look
at that tanker, don't you?

01:20:52.832 --> 01:20:54.265
Yes, I do.

01:20:55.334 --> 01:20:57.097
Shall I contact Gogol?

01:20:57.169 --> 01:20:59.433
There's no need.

01:20:59.505 --> 01:21:04.340
- M has already offered to fix it.
- Very nice.

01:21:04.410 --> 01:21:07.607
It's Austrian.
I bought it in Berngarten.

01:21:11.183 --> 01:21:14.710
- I was doing some skiing.
- When was this?

01:21:14.787 --> 01:21:16.948
About three weeks ago. Why?

01:21:29.368 --> 01:21:31.461
Do you recognize him?

01:21:33.572 --> 01:21:35.005
Who is he?

01:21:36.876 --> 01:21:39.310
The man I loved.

01:21:39.378 --> 01:21:43.109
He was in Berngarten
three weeks ago.

01:21:44.183 --> 01:21:46.117
Did you kill him?

01:21:53.325 --> 01:21:55.589
When someone's behind you on skis
at 40 miles an hour...

01:21:55.661 --> 01:21:58.255
trying to put a bullet
in your back...

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:00.924
you don't always
have time to remember a face.

01:22:03.335 --> 01:22:06.771
In our business,
people get killed.

01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:10.206
We both know that.
So did he.

01:22:11.677 --> 01:22:14.475
It was either him or me.

01:22:14.546 --> 01:22:18.846
The answer to the question is yes.
I did kill him.

01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:24.751
Then, when this mission is over...

01:22:24.823 --> 01:22:26.256
I will kill you.

01:22:53.652 --> 01:22:55.085
Come in.

01:22:59.491 --> 01:23:01.755
- Commander Carter?
- That's right. Welcome aboard.

01:23:01.827 --> 01:23:06.594
Major. Have a seat.
Can I get you something?

01:23:06.665 --> 01:23:08.895
Not for me, thank you.
I don't know about the major.

01:23:14.173 --> 01:23:16.801
I'm sorry.
I hadn't expected you to be a woman.

01:23:16.875 --> 01:23:21.312
Aboard this vessel, Commander,
I am Major Amasova of the Russian Army.

01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:24.679
- Yeah, sure.
- It's good of you to help us out.

01:23:24.750 --> 01:23:26.741
Got a couple cabins at your disposal.

01:23:26.819 --> 01:23:28.286
Thank you.

01:23:28.354 --> 01:23:31.551
Major, you're most welcome
to use the shower in my quarters.

01:23:31.623 --> 01:23:34.717
You do not have to show me
any special favors, Commander.

01:23:34.793 --> 01:23:37.762
All the same,
I think it might be better if I did.

01:23:45.204 --> 01:23:47.604
From Com Sub Atlantic, sir.

01:23:47.673 --> 01:23:49.402
Right.

01:23:55.614 --> 01:23:57.707
What's the matter, sailor?

01:23:57.783 --> 01:24:00.013
You never see a major
taking a shower before?

01:24:22.274 --> 01:24:25.141
Stand by for second observation
on target.

01:24:25.210 --> 01:24:26.643
Up scope.

01:24:31.283 --> 01:24:32.716
Check.

01:24:37.156 --> 01:24:41.286
Target bearing. Mark.
Range. Mark.

01:24:42.361 --> 01:24:44.420
Down scope.

01:24:44.496 --> 01:24:48.159
- One division in high power.
- Range 6,200 yards, sir.

01:24:48.233 --> 01:24:50.167
Angle on the bow, port 50.

01:24:50.235 --> 01:24:52.567
Control, Torpedo Room.
Boarding party ready, sir.

01:24:58.143 --> 01:25:03.080
Captain, sir, our best solution for
the target is 120. Speed three knots.

01:25:03.148 --> 01:25:06.549
Officer of the deck, come right north.
Maneuvering, make turns for 11 knots.

01:25:06.618 --> 01:25:08.108
Officer of the deck, aye, sir.

01:25:08.187 --> 01:25:12.453
Which bullet has my name on it?
The first or the last?

01:25:12.524 --> 01:25:16.858
I have never failed on a mission,
Commander. Any mission.

01:25:18.464 --> 01:25:19.897
In that case, Major...

01:25:19.965 --> 01:25:23.025
one of us is bound
to end up gravely disappointed...

01:25:23.102 --> 01:25:24.535
because neither of the...

01:25:27.573 --> 01:25:30.133
Control, Maneuvering.
We're losing electrical frequency.

01:25:31.577 --> 01:25:34.307
Control, Sonar. Total power
supplies failure on all sets.

01:25:34.379 --> 01:25:37.837
- Surface!
- Blow forward! Blow aft!

01:25:55.033 --> 01:25:57.058
Up scope. Stand by.

01:26:02.975 --> 01:26:04.909
Where the hell is she?

01:26:07.146 --> 01:26:08.579
She's right behind us.

01:26:14.553 --> 01:26:15.986
Impossible.

01:27:20.483 --> 01:27:22.815
Stand by on number two dock.

01:27:25.621 --> 01:27:27.714
Liparus crew, take up positions.

01:27:32.328 --> 01:27:33.989
Dock Officer to Operations.

01:27:34.063 --> 01:27:36.691
Mobilization crew
entering dock area.

01:27:40.236 --> 01:27:42.101
Number two dock to Operations.

01:27:42.171 --> 01:27:44.537
Twenty-five meters to run.
I say again.

01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:54.438
Operation Room to number two dock.
Docking now complete.

01:27:54.517 --> 01:27:57.384
Disembarkation crew
moving into position.

01:28:09.031 --> 01:28:12.967
S Ray program completed.
Magnetic field shut down.

01:28:13.035 --> 01:28:15.196
All systems normal.

01:28:15.271 --> 01:28:17.739
Limpet speaker
in position, sir.

01:28:17.807 --> 01:28:21.675
Commander,
you have precisely two minutes...

01:28:21.744 --> 01:28:24.975
to open your hatches
and surrender your ship.

01:28:25.047 --> 01:28:30.178
The alternative is extermination
by cyanide gas.

01:28:31.721 --> 01:28:34.019
Well?

01:28:34.090 --> 01:28:36.024
There's no alternative.

01:28:39.729 --> 01:28:42.823
Now hear this.
Your Captain speaking.

01:28:42.898 --> 01:28:45.594
Open all hatches and proceed quietly
onto the casing.

01:28:55.711 --> 01:28:58.942
Hurry, Commander.
I'm not renown for my patience.

01:29:02.485 --> 01:29:04.419
Okay, two ranks.
Move it out.

01:29:07.957 --> 01:29:09.925
Stay close to me.
We'll try and hide you.

01:29:11.127 --> 01:29:14.096
Our time is limited, Captain.

01:29:14.163 --> 01:29:16.791
- Commence operations forthwith.
- Yes, sir.

01:29:19.368 --> 01:29:21.836
Attention all personnel.

01:29:21.904 --> 01:29:24.429
Stromberg crews One and Two...

01:29:24.507 --> 01:29:26.441
embark your submarines.

01:29:40.523 --> 01:29:43.287
Put the Americans in
with the others, Captain.

01:29:44.894 --> 01:29:46.327
Remove the prisoners.

01:29:54.403 --> 01:29:56.337
Don't look up.
You're on Candid Camera.

01:29:59.842 --> 01:30:01.776
Complete nuclear missile loading.

01:30:35.211 --> 01:30:38.442
Operations, Radar.
No contacts within 25,000 meters.

01:30:38.514 --> 01:30:40.505
Bring those two prisoners here.

01:31:04.306 --> 01:31:06.866
Let's go. Come on now.

01:31:06.942 --> 01:31:08.705
Operations Room, Sonar.

01:31:08.778 --> 01:31:10.678
No contacts, no transmissions.

01:31:10.746 --> 01:31:12.680
Cease stable hold.

01:31:16.485 --> 01:31:19.010
You have certainly been persistent.

01:31:19.088 --> 01:31:23.525
Very well.
Now your curiosity can be satisfied.

01:31:23.592 --> 01:31:25.287
Both crews aboard, sir.

01:31:25.361 --> 01:31:27.022
Missile onload completed.

01:31:27.096 --> 01:31:29.826
They have already
been given their targets.

01:31:29.899 --> 01:31:33.494
At 12:00 noon, they will have
reached firing positions.

01:31:33.569 --> 01:31:37.972
Within minutes,
New York and Moscow...

01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:39.974
will cease to exist.

01:31:40.042 --> 01:31:42.909
Global destruction will follow.

01:31:44.046 --> 01:31:46.640
The new era will begin.

01:31:46.715 --> 01:31:49.582
Submarines One and Two...

01:31:49.652 --> 01:31:52.712
commence departure drill.

01:31:52.788 --> 01:31:55.780
All right, you've made your point.

01:31:55.858 --> 01:31:57.382
How much do you want?

01:31:57.459 --> 01:31:59.893
"How much?"

01:31:59.962 --> 01:32:01.987
Whatever do you mean, Mr. Bond?

01:32:02.064 --> 01:32:05.124
The price for not firing
those nuclear missiles.

01:32:06.602 --> 01:32:09.264
You're deluded, Mr. Bond.

01:32:09.338 --> 01:32:12.068
I'm not interested in extortion.

01:32:12.141 --> 01:32:14.666
I intend to change the face
of history.

01:32:14.743 --> 01:32:16.506
By destroying the world?

01:32:16.579 --> 01:32:19.207
By creating a world.

01:32:19.281 --> 01:32:22.375
A new and beautiful world
beneath the sea.

01:32:22.451 --> 01:32:26.854
Today, civilization as we know it
is corrupt and decadent.

01:32:26.922 --> 01:32:29.584
Inevitably, it will destroy itself.

01:32:29.658 --> 01:32:33.594
I'm merely accelerating the process.

01:32:33.662 --> 01:32:36.631
That does not justify mass murder.

01:32:36.699 --> 01:32:38.792
For that, Major...

01:32:38.868 --> 01:32:41.837
I will accept the judgment
of posterity.

01:32:43.038 --> 01:32:45.233
Submarines ready for departure, sir.

01:32:46.775 --> 01:32:49.300
Open bow doors, Captain.

01:32:54.516 --> 01:32:56.450
Stromberg One...

01:32:56.518 --> 01:32:59.612
you are clear
to proceed to sea.

01:33:05.127 --> 01:33:09.894
Stromberg Two, you are also clear
to proceed to sea. Forward stern.

01:33:15.104 --> 01:33:18.972
Observe, Mr. Bond,
the instruments of Armageddon.

01:33:50.673 --> 01:33:53.437
Put this man
with the rest of the prisoners.

01:33:55.077 --> 01:33:58.638
The lady will be traveling to Atlantis
with me.

01:34:07.790 --> 01:34:09.724
Farewell, Mr. Bond.

01:34:09.792 --> 01:34:12.022
That word has, I must admit...

01:34:12.094 --> 01:34:15.495
a welcome ring of permanency
about it.

01:34:17.099 --> 01:34:18.862
Au revoir, Anya.

01:34:19.969 --> 01:34:21.402
Bring her.

01:35:04.913 --> 01:35:07.074
Get that man!

01:35:14.123 --> 01:35:16.114
Keep going.

01:35:31.807 --> 01:35:33.365
Call him over.

01:35:49.591 --> 01:35:52.321
- Where's your captain?
- Here.

01:35:52.394 --> 01:35:54.191
Release the other crews,
then make for the armory.

01:35:54.263 --> 01:35:55.787
Follow me, men.
At the double.

01:36:04.073 --> 01:36:05.506
Come on. Let's go.

01:36:13.015 --> 01:36:14.812
Seal the operations room!

01:36:25.461 --> 01:36:28.294
You! Stand by over there!

01:36:37.907 --> 01:36:39.738
Help yourself to firearms!

01:36:44.413 --> 01:36:46.438
Grab a weapon.
Come on, let's go.

01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:45.467
We've taken both sides of the lower dock
area, but your captain's dead.

01:38:45.534 --> 01:38:47.502
We're still no closer
to that control room.

01:38:49.171 --> 01:38:51.105
Leave it to me, sir.

01:38:54.710 --> 01:38:57.645
Andrews, James, Marchal, Purvis.
Follow me.

01:39:27.843 --> 01:39:30.403
That armored plating
must be inches thick.

01:39:30.479 --> 01:39:32.709
- We'll never get through it.
- Let's get to the armory.

01:39:32.781 --> 01:39:34.942
- What do you reckon to find there?
- A nuclear missile.

01:39:35.017 --> 01:39:37.110
A nuc... Hey, wait!

01:39:50.732 --> 01:39:52.825
This could take hours, sir.

01:39:52.901 --> 01:39:54.892
You got a date?

01:39:54.970 --> 01:39:56.528
No, sir.

01:40:00.976 --> 01:40:03.001
Now you are beautiful.

01:40:03.078 --> 01:40:06.411
I'm sorry if you feel
less than comfortable...

01:40:06.482 --> 01:40:10.942
but you have a tendency to violence
that must be controlled.

01:40:14.590 --> 01:40:18.026
- What is it?
- I have to report, sir...

01:40:18.093 --> 01:40:20.493
a breakout by some
of the prisoners.

01:40:20.562 --> 01:40:22.530
That is unfortunate, Captain.

01:40:22.598 --> 01:40:25.692
However, sir, we now
have the situation under control.

01:40:25.767 --> 01:40:28.895
The operations room
is quite impregnable.

01:40:28.971 --> 01:40:34.170
Then we must hope, Captain,
that you will suffer no further mishap.

01:40:45.154 --> 01:40:47.179
All I need out of here
is the detonator.

01:41:06.141 --> 01:41:08.666
James, are you sure
you know what you're doing?

01:41:10.078 --> 01:41:12.012
There has to be a first time
for everything.

01:41:19.021 --> 01:41:20.545
Blast.

01:41:21.857 --> 01:41:23.791
What's the problem?

01:41:23.859 --> 01:41:26.327
I mustn't touch any part
of the impulse conductor circuit.

01:41:27.763 --> 01:41:30.323
This ring houses the impulse conductor
circuit, sir.

01:41:30.399 --> 01:41:35.166
It's magnetic. I mustn't touch it
with any part of the detonator.

01:41:35.237 --> 01:41:38.832
- What happens if you do?
- It'll go off.

01:42:18.213 --> 01:42:20.704
- Get me a number six detonator.
- Aye, aye, sir.

01:42:24.286 --> 01:42:27.346
- Number six, sir.
- Thank you.

01:42:27.422 --> 01:42:29.447
Did you fix that 20-second fuse?

01:42:29.524 --> 01:42:30.957
Yes, sir. Here it is.

01:42:32.294 --> 01:42:35.525
Plastic explosive.

01:42:49.544 --> 01:42:51.512
Is everything proceeding
according to plan?

01:42:51.580 --> 01:42:54.378
- Yes, sir.
- Excellent.

01:44:21.136 --> 01:44:22.797
- Sir?
- What is it?

01:44:22.871 --> 01:44:25.169
The monitors faded.

01:44:48.897 --> 01:44:49.921
Change the circuit.

01:45:21.129 --> 01:45:22.596
Cease fire!

01:45:24.599 --> 01:45:26.965
You're too late, Bond.

01:45:27.035 --> 01:45:30.061
Our submarines are already on station.

01:45:30.138 --> 01:45:33.869
In four minutes,
the missiles will be launched.

01:45:38.713 --> 01:45:40.840
Can you work
the printout transmission unit?

01:45:40.916 --> 01:45:42.941
Sure,
but we've only got three minutes.

01:45:43.018 --> 01:45:47.114
If we can work out the position of those
submarines, maybe we can reprogram them.

01:45:47.189 --> 01:45:49.123
- To do what?
- To destroy each other.

01:46:28.661 --> 01:46:30.424
James! The globe!

01:46:36.102 --> 01:46:41.096
Pass the position of the first submarine
to the second as their target.

01:46:41.173 --> 01:46:43.198
- And vice versa?
- Exactly.

01:47:08.567 --> 01:47:12.333
Missile Control, this is the Captain.
We have a change of target.

01:47:12.404 --> 01:47:17.364
New coordinates are 034285219.

01:47:33.926 --> 01:47:37.225
Missile Control, Captain.
We have a new target.

01:48:57.243 --> 01:49:00.440
Everybody back on board the submarine!
Pass it on!

01:49:00.512 --> 01:49:01.979
Come on! Let's go!

01:49:12.725 --> 01:49:15.922
Foster, get those lines cleared!
Come on!

01:49:15.995 --> 01:49:17.428
Leaver, throw those guys a line!

01:49:18.731 --> 01:49:21.461
Get those block fenders cleared!
Fore and aft!

01:49:21.533 --> 01:49:23.728
Get the submarine
at diving stations!

01:49:33.379 --> 01:49:36.007
Control, Maneuvering.
Reactor at half-power state.

01:49:36.081 --> 01:49:37.514
Ready to check telegraphs.

01:49:37.583 --> 01:49:40.677
All personnel,
take up positions fast!

01:49:40.753 --> 01:49:42.846
- Get Roberts in the gyro unit.
- Right.

01:49:42.921 --> 01:49:44.513
Come on! Move it!

01:49:51.864 --> 01:49:53.957
Stand by to revert
to normal lighting.

01:49:54.033 --> 01:49:56.627
Come on, sailor.
Get that hatch shut quick.

01:49:59.872 --> 01:50:01.464
- Torpedo Room, Control.
- Torpedo Room.

01:50:01.540 --> 01:50:03.974
Load tube one
with mark 46 torpedo.

01:50:13.252 --> 01:50:15.049
Open outer door on tube one.

01:50:16.889 --> 01:50:18.880
Select zero gyro angle.

01:50:20.626 --> 01:50:22.491
Outer door on tube one open.

01:50:22.561 --> 01:50:24.051
Match bearings and shoot.

01:50:24.129 --> 01:50:26.290
- Set.
- Shoot.

01:50:29.134 --> 01:50:30.897
Torpedo running.

01:50:50.289 --> 01:50:53.019
Rudder amidships.
Ahead two-thirds.

01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:04.496
Left seven degrees rudder.

01:52:38.664 --> 01:52:40.097
How far would you say?

01:52:42.401 --> 01:52:46.132
- About 10,000 yards, sir.
- Commander.

01:52:55.013 --> 01:52:56.446
Close it.

01:53:00.185 --> 01:53:02.449
I just got this signal
from the Pentagon.

01:53:02.521 --> 01:53:04.785
On instructions
from the Security Council:

01:53:04.857 --> 01:53:06.950
"Destroy Atlantis fast. "

01:53:07.025 --> 01:53:08.458
What does "fast" mean?

01:53:08.527 --> 01:53:10.791
Battle stations five minutes.

01:53:11.864 --> 01:53:13.957
With torpedoes?

01:53:14.032 --> 01:53:15.795
Yes.

01:53:15.868 --> 01:53:18.132
He has Anya on there.

01:53:18.203 --> 01:53:20.637
- I know. I'm sorry.
- I have to get her off.

01:53:20.706 --> 01:53:23.800
- How?
- Can I have the equipment Q sent?

01:53:23.876 --> 01:53:25.309
Sure.

01:53:27.880 --> 01:53:31.316
Barton. That package
for Commander Bond, bring it in quick.

01:53:34.052 --> 01:53:36.452
- I need an hour.
- That comes from the top!

01:53:36.522 --> 01:53:37.955
Forty minutes!

01:53:39.024 --> 01:53:40.992
You're gonna get me court-martialed.

01:53:43.562 --> 01:53:44.995
One hour.

01:53:46.231 --> 01:53:47.664
Come in.

01:53:51.069 --> 01:53:52.764
I'll give you a hand.

01:54:44.222 --> 01:54:47.817
Good evening, Mr. Bond.
I've been expecting you.

01:54:47.892 --> 01:54:52.420
Stay where you are.
I'll send the elevator down for you.

01:55:06.210 --> 01:55:08.201
Good-bye, Mr. Bond.

01:55:19.857 --> 01:55:21.950
You did want me to drop in.

01:55:33.037 --> 01:55:36.905
- Where's Anya?
- Well, well, well.

01:55:36.975 --> 01:55:41.139
A British agent
in love with a Russian agent.

01:55:41.212 --> 01:55:42.873
Detente, indeed.

01:55:46.384 --> 01:55:48.784
Sit down, Mr. Bond.

01:55:54.225 --> 01:55:57.956
- Your time is running out.
- Yours too, Mr. Bond.

01:55:59.731 --> 01:56:02.165
And faster than you think.

01:56:11.743 --> 01:56:15.144
You shot your bolt.
Now it's my turn.

01:58:21.806 --> 01:58:23.637
How does that grab you?

01:59:12.056 --> 01:59:15.150
We're five minutes overdue, Captain.

01:59:23.734 --> 01:59:25.827
- Stromberg?
- Dead.

01:59:25.903 --> 01:59:27.894
So are we
unless we get out of here fast.

01:59:27.972 --> 01:59:29.496
Match bearings and shoot.

02:01:44.408 --> 02:01:46.501
Maybe I misjudged Stromberg.

02:01:46.577 --> 02:01:50.343
Any man who drinks Dom Perignon '52
can't be all bad.

02:01:54.518 --> 02:01:57.112
The mission is over, Commander.

02:02:12.036 --> 02:02:16.097
In my country, the condemned man
is usually allowed a final request.

02:02:16.173 --> 02:02:17.538
Granted.

02:02:21.212 --> 02:02:23.840
Let's get out of these wet things.

02:02:47.238 --> 02:02:51.971
But, James,
what would our superiors say?

02:02:52.043 --> 02:02:53.476
They'll never know.

02:02:59.350 --> 02:03:01.284
Lower the stern gate.

02:03:01.352 --> 02:03:04.344
- Is there danger of the bends?
- We'll soon find out.

02:03:32.683 --> 02:03:35.516
- 007.
- XXX.

02:03:35.586 --> 02:03:37.019
What are you doing?

02:03:40.057 --> 02:03:42.321
Keeping the British end up, sir.
