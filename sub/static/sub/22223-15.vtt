WEBVTT

00:01.043 --> 00:02.658
Previously on Farscape.

00:02.753 --> 00:05.335
Welcome home, son.

00:05.423 --> 00:10.213
Scorpius is here, looking
for the key to what is
inside my head.

00:10.303 --> 00:12.885
He will use you and the baby.

00:12.972 --> 00:13.882
Skreeth?

00:13.973 --> 00:16.134
I'm confident I can
capture him,

00:16.225 --> 00:18.341
but doubt I can bring
him to you.

00:18.436 --> 00:23.305
Wherever this Earth is,
the journey there is
obviously impractical without wormhole travel,

00:23.399 --> 00:25.390
and only Crichton can
command that.

00:25.484 --> 00:29.102
Learn what we can from him,
then execute him.

00:30.656 --> 00:32.396
Stay. Look, we'll guard
the wormhole.

00:32.491 --> 00:34.277
Nothing'll get through.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.324
No, l have a job to do.

00:37.330 --> 00:38.786
It's over.

00:38.873 --> 00:42.036
There's nothing more
between us.

00:44.921 --> 00:46.286
Nothing.

00:56.933 --> 01:00.221
And now on Farscape.

01:00.311 --> 01:02.597
Pilot:
We have reached the optimal
departure point.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.350
D'Argo, Rygel and Scorpius
are boarding Lo'La.

01:05.441 --> 01:09.434
Chiana, Sikozu and Noranti are
already in a Transport Pod.

01:09.528 --> 01:11.234
Tell 'em we're coming.

01:11.322 --> 01:13.529
Merry Christmas.

01:13.616 --> 01:14.901
Is there something that
comes with this?

01:14.992 --> 01:17.278
It's big. It's taking over
your room.

01:17.370 --> 01:19.611
Okay, tell 'em we're not
coming! We're gonna stay.

01:19.705 --> 01:23.789
We'll watch TV, we'll
eat popcorn, we'll act
like normal people.

01:23.876 --> 01:27.744
Captain D'Argo is asking
where you are.

01:27.838 --> 01:29.703
I gotta go. I gotta go
look after Scorpius.

01:29.799 --> 01:31.039
We should do it together.

01:31.133 --> 01:33.545
No, you know we can't
do that together.

01:33.636 --> 01:35.422
Besides, you gotta look
after the girls.

01:35.513 --> 01:36.628
That's not fun.

01:36.722 --> 01:39.179
It's more fun than mental-arts
training camp.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.973
Don't know. You could do with
the mental discipline.

01:41.060 --> 01:44.803
Ha. Not from someone
Scorpy recommends.
You got the betterjob.

01:44.897 --> 01:48.765
What, rummaging around on a
dead Leviathan settlement
looking for a Moya part?

01:48.859 --> 01:50.520
Oh, that's infinitely
more thrilling.

01:50.611 --> 01:55.696
I'm sorry, but now Chiana
is inquiring where you
are Officer Sun.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.739
I'm coming, Pilot.

01:57.827 --> 01:59.613
We gotta go.

02:01.372 --> 02:03.954
Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

02:09.338 --> 02:12.546
Katoya:
You have all come to
my dwelling to learn.

02:12.633 --> 02:17.047
Your objective is
mental discipline.

02:17.138 --> 02:21.848
To focus your whole mind
on a single task is a skill
few ever achieve.

02:21.934 --> 02:23.845
How much did we pay for this?

02:23.936 --> 02:27.554
The TaskChairs provide access
to a mindscape,

02:27.648 --> 02:32.984
where you'll compete with
an opponent to the point
of great pain.

02:33.070 --> 02:36.187
Embrace the pain and
you shall succeed.

02:36.282 --> 02:40.651
Retreat, and suffer
the consequences.

02:40.745 --> 02:45.489
If you have any self-doubt,
you have 80 microts to exit,

02:45.583 --> 02:50.043
after which, your Juxtowi
crystal will be activated.

02:50.129 --> 02:53.838
Any attempt to leave and
the crystal will bore
through your brain.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.540
Do you think it's worth
going through with this?

02:56.635 --> 02:59.126
Only if this guy can give us
information about that critter

02:59.221 --> 03:01.712
that attacked my family
and killed my friends.

03:01.807 --> 03:05.766
The creature you describe
is neither Peacekeeper
nor Scarran in origin.

03:05.853 --> 03:10.187
If it is from Tormented Space,
Katoya will know about it.

03:10.274 --> 03:12.390
Then why won't he just
frelling tell us...

03:12.485 --> 03:14.271
Shh.
-...about it?

03:14.362 --> 03:15.727
We paid him.

03:15.821 --> 03:18.437
His price is completion
of the course.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.523
Excuse me. Question.

03:20.618 --> 03:22.609
Before we commit to
your class...

03:22.703 --> 03:25.319
Are you afraid that you may not
be able to handle the pain?

03:25.414 --> 03:29.327
Look, I can put up with the
fairy crystal and the jammies,

03:29.418 --> 03:33.206
but I need to know what else
we get in gym membership.

03:33.297 --> 03:35.003
What the plitz is that smell?

03:35.091 --> 03:37.707
Rygel:
The stench of that
frelling Charrid.

03:38.302 --> 03:40.714
No, I know that odor.

03:45.434 --> 03:47.220
D'Argo:
Macton.

03:47.311 --> 03:48.926
(hissing)

03:51.399 --> 03:52.809
You killed my wife.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.265
This is not your fight.
-Your sister!

03:54.360 --> 03:56.146
You set me up and then
you sent me to prison.

03:56.237 --> 03:59.400
Oh, you didn't want the
truth then. You're not
interested now.

03:59.490 --> 04:02.027
Get off him. Come on.

04:02.118 --> 04:03.858
I'm not interested
in your lies.

04:03.953 --> 04:07.195
Oh, let him hit me, like he
hit Lo'Laan. Beat his
own wife to death.

04:07.289 --> 04:09.325
(furious howl )

04:18.801 --> 04:20.587
That ends this.

04:26.350 --> 04:30.263
My name is John Crichton,
an astronaut.

04:30.354 --> 04:34.063
Three years ago I got shot
through a wormhole.

04:34.150 --> 04:35.936
I'm in a distant part
of the universe

04:36.026 --> 04:39.234
aboard this living ship of
escaped prisoners,

04:39.321 --> 04:41.061
my friends.

04:42.158 --> 04:43.944
I've made enemies.

04:44.034 --> 04:47.276
Powerful, dangerous.

04:47.371 --> 04:50.909
Now all I want is to
find a way home

04:51.000 --> 04:53.742
to warn Earth.

04:53.836 --> 04:58.921
Look upward and share
the wonders I've seen.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.329
You okay, bro?

05:34.210 --> 05:36.201
Macton's a liar.

05:36.295 --> 05:37.535
He's a frelling liar.

05:37.630 --> 05:39.495
Rygel:
He's a frelling Peacekeeper.

05:39.590 --> 05:41.876
A frelling Peacekeeper
found us.

05:41.967 --> 05:45.300
Let's go, fast, before
more arrive.

05:45.387 --> 05:50.051
I am afraid it will not
be permitted to leave the
compound prematurely.

05:50.142 --> 05:51.643
Oh, ridiculous.

05:51.727 --> 05:53.342
What does Katoya care?

05:53.437 --> 05:54.552
He's got our currency.

05:54.647 --> 05:58.560
Once you agree to stay,
you must abide the rules.

05:58.651 --> 06:00.266
Crichton:
ldon't give a damn
about the rules,

06:00.361 --> 06:03.228
we're not gonna stick around
till a Marauder lands.

06:03.322 --> 06:08.487
This sector of Tormented Space
is forbidden to Peacekeepers

06:08.577 --> 06:14.322
unless they have received
express orders from First
Command and therefore,

06:14.416 --> 06:18.876
it is highly likely that Macton
is here unofficially...

06:18.963 --> 06:20.203
alone.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.710
Unofficially, Grasshopper,
how the hell did he find us?

06:23.801 --> 06:26.918
I'll be sure to ask him
before I kill him.

06:29.390 --> 06:34.180
Katoya will not allow you or
Macton to kill each other.

06:34.270 --> 06:36.181
To Hezmana with Katoya!

06:36.272 --> 06:38.479
Macton deserves to die!

06:40.734 --> 06:43.567
He destroyed my family.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.819
My wife.

06:47.324 --> 06:48.484
My son.

06:48.576 --> 06:51.158
Lo'Laan:
He loves me.
You mustn't do anything.

06:51.245 --> 06:54.908
D'Argo's done nothing to me.
I'm fine. D'Argo's fine.

06:54.999 --> 06:58.366
You refuse to see him
for what he really is.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.121
He is a Luxan warrior.

07:00.212 --> 07:04.922
Yes. And he cannot
help but hurt you.

07:05.009 --> 07:07.751
D'Argo will never hurt me.

07:07.845 --> 07:10.757
And I won't hurt him either.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.605
Good to see you, brother.

07:34.246 --> 07:36.908
No. We're both here.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.366
One of us must die.

07:42.546 --> 07:46.289
lwouldn't run even ifl could.

07:52.389 --> 07:56.849
D, I got your back on this.

07:56.935 --> 08:00.519
Grasshopper may be
telling the truth.

08:00.606 --> 08:04.224
Katoya won't let us
disrupt his class.

08:05.194 --> 08:08.311
You can deal with Macton
when school is out.

08:09.073 --> 08:10.108
( buzzer)

08:10.199 --> 08:12.781
Katoya:
Return to the arena.

08:17.289 --> 08:19.450
Recess is over.

08:23.212 --> 08:25.544
Now that calmer minds prevail,

08:26.173 --> 08:28.129
a demonstration.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.585
Join me.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.004
I'm just here to watch.

08:42.106 --> 08:44.392
Everyone must participate.

08:44.483 --> 08:48.601
After the probes, land mines,
corkscrews I've had in my head,

08:48.696 --> 08:51.984
I ain't offering up a chunk
for your mind games.

08:52.074 --> 08:53.610
It is not a game.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.566
It ain't gonna happen,
Miss Krabappel.

08:55.661 --> 08:58.277
Fail me. Give me an "F"
on my report card.

08:58.372 --> 09:01.364
But I ain't going in
your icosahedron.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.118
Yes, of course.

09:07.923 --> 09:11.165
Proves nothing to me for you
to win, Grasshopper.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.652
Begin.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.741
Overcome the pain.

09:43.751 --> 09:47.369
Pain. See, that's what
I'm talking about.

09:47.463 --> 09:49.124
Pain.

10:08.317 --> 10:09.978
Try again.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.077
Do not withhold your efforts.

10:23.749 --> 10:27.537
Nor is anger a substitute
for clarity.

10:27.628 --> 10:32.088
The task may be completed with
a minimum of physical harm.

10:43.060 --> 10:48.430
(deep breathing )

10:51.985 --> 10:54.601
Shall we end our demonstration?

10:54.696 --> 10:59.281
(straining):
I was just starting to
enjoy the pain.

11:13.632 --> 11:16.169
Crichton:
Well, that was instructive.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.922
Kind of led with your
chin there.

11:19.012 --> 11:21.503
It's not meant to be painless.

11:26.895 --> 11:30.012
It never will be
painless, John.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.147
Oh.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.863
What the hell are
you doing here?

11:43.954 --> 11:46.115
Responding to D'Argo's
death threats.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.913
He said he was coming for me.

11:49.001 --> 11:50.832
Oh.

11:50.919 --> 11:53.706
See, I was just wondering why
you followed me to the bathroom.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.662
I don't want to kill D'Argo.

11:55.757 --> 11:59.170
But I won't allow him to kill
me to conceal what he did.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.343
He killed his wife.

12:01.430 --> 12:03.887
No. You killed your sister.

12:03.974 --> 12:07.387
D'Argo murdered Lo'Laan
in a fit of hyperrage.

12:07.477 --> 12:09.308
Do you know what Luxan
hyperrage is?

12:09.396 --> 12:12.183
Yes, I do. Do you know
what a "crock" is?

12:12.274 --> 12:14.936
D'Argo says he didn't do it.
That's good enough for me.

12:15.027 --> 12:17.484
You don't understand.
He may not know what he did.

12:17.571 --> 12:21.689
Right, eight cycles and change
just, zoop, slips his mind.

12:21.783 --> 12:25.651
You do know that Luxan
hyperrage causes blackouts?

12:26.705 --> 12:27.945
Is that a fact?

12:28.040 --> 12:29.120
Yes.

12:29.207 --> 12:32.415
And any honest Luxan
can tell you that.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.213
Please.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.667
Rygel:
The Charrid's going next.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.798
I'd love to take him on.

12:43.889 --> 12:46.722
I'd show him some real pain.

12:48.060 --> 12:49.175
What did he say to you?

12:49.269 --> 12:50.429
Nothing. Forget about it.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.805
I can't!

12:51.897 --> 12:54.479
Perhaps you could spend some
of that energy in here.

12:54.566 --> 12:55.681
Rygel:
Not him.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.312
Me.

12:57.402 --> 12:58.482
He chose me, Rygel.

12:58.570 --> 13:01.562
These Charrid frax killed
billions of my people.

13:01.657 --> 13:04.899
This is not a safe place to
settle grudges, Hynerian.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.826
It is not a game.
-It's a war of wills.

13:07.913 --> 13:13.658
Where else will I get a chance
at a fair fight, where l
have the advantage?

13:13.752 --> 13:15.117
Proceed.

13:15.212 --> 13:17.123
At your own risk.

13:17.214 --> 13:18.750
D'Argo:
What lies did Macton tell you?

13:18.840 --> 13:20.876
Ah, he just mentioned you were
sending some threats.

13:20.968 --> 13:24.005
Yeah. It's true.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.264
Katoya:
Begin.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.280
D'Argo:
Come on, he must have
told you more.

13:46.368 --> 13:48.074
Man, I don't wanna
talk about it.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.822
It's just gonna piss you off,
which is what he wants.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.744
D'Argo:
I'm already pissed off.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.618
What'd he say?

13:54.292 --> 13:56.328
He mentioned something.

13:56.420 --> 14:00.413
About hyperrage causing
blackouts. He said all
Luxans get 'em.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.463
D'Argo:
I do not want Macton here!

14:02.551 --> 14:04.382
I refuse to have him
in this house!

14:04.469 --> 14:06.425
You're upsetting yourself
over nothing.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.753
D'Argo, can you hear me?

14:07.848 --> 14:09.713
( screaming )
-D'Argo, can you hear me?

14:09.808 --> 14:12.094
( screaming )

14:14.688 --> 14:16.804
D'Argo...

14:23.947 --> 14:27.815
Blackouts during
hyperrage can...

14:29.286 --> 14:32.323
do happen.

14:36.376 --> 14:39.209
But I learned to
control all that.

14:39.296 --> 14:40.706
So, you got the problem licked.

14:40.797 --> 14:45.291
Young Luxans are
genetically violent.

14:45.385 --> 14:51.221
Their impulses, chemistry,
biology, it takes cycles
to master.

14:51.308 --> 14:53.970
It's why Luxans aren't
allowed to marry young.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.972
And you kids ignored all that.

14:56.063 --> 15:00.102
She said she knew I could
never hurt her.

15:00.192 --> 15:02.308
Even more than that, I gave
her my solemn vow

15:02.402 --> 15:07.112
if I did ever hurt her,
I would leave immediately,
no questions.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.155
Well, it must have worked.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.403
You guys stayed together.

15:11.495 --> 15:14.578
Lo'Laan was always
there for me.

15:15.832 --> 15:19.165
(Rygel groaning)

15:19.252 --> 15:21.789
Excuse me, Master Jedi.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.168
Looks like Sparky's losing more
than a few brain cells in there.

15:25.258 --> 15:27.249
He's expending a lot of energy.

15:27.344 --> 15:29.676
Crichton:
Is he in any real danger
in there?

15:34.935 --> 15:36.516
(groaning)

15:36.603 --> 15:38.468
All right, that's the ball
game. Get him out.

15:38.563 --> 15:40.428
It was his choice.

15:40.524 --> 15:42.230
Let's get him out.

15:59.084 --> 16:01.370
D'Argo:
He's like ice.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.378
Keep him covered.

16:07.509 --> 16:10.717
That's a great job.
Nice of you to step in
before somebody got hurt.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.760
What he did was his choice.

16:12.848 --> 16:14.634
I hope what he learned
will serve him well.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.339
I'll tell you what
we've learned.

16:16.434 --> 16:18.015
We've learned not to take
classes from a head job.

16:18.103 --> 16:20.640
Now we're outta here.
-Your training isn't over.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.311
Oh, yes it is.

16:25.402 --> 16:27.233
It's just begun.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.194
Master.

16:41.126 --> 16:42.457
Crichton is fine.

16:42.544 --> 16:44.785
He's been moved to
remedial training.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.165
Yeah, I know.

16:46.256 --> 16:48.497
The Dominar is
recovering as well.

16:48.592 --> 16:51.550
Yeah, I wasn't thinking
about that, either.

16:51.636 --> 16:54.252
I'm aware of that.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.054
But perhaps you should
heed their example

16:57.142 --> 17:01.181
and attempt to remain focused
on your more immediate
tasks first.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.353
( growls )

17:03.440 --> 17:04.771
Please.

17:12.324 --> 17:14.030
Stay focused.

17:14.576 --> 17:15.782
Lo'Laan:
D'Argo.

17:15.869 --> 17:18.235
D'Argo, can you hear me?

17:25.378 --> 17:26.993
Did I hurt you?

17:27.088 --> 17:29.579
No. I know this upsets you.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.920
It upsets you, too.

17:33.011 --> 17:35.252
We'll get through it.

17:36.765 --> 17:42.260
If I did hurt you, you'd
tell me, wouldn't you?

17:42.354 --> 17:43.810
You promised.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.934
You never hurt me, D'Argo.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.858
But you'd tell me if I did.

17:50.612 --> 17:52.398
Absolutely.

17:52.489 --> 17:55.526
I promise. I would tell you.

18:04.334 --> 18:06.165
(yells)

18:06.253 --> 18:09.871
Katoya:
Avoid pain, and find a way out.

18:13.385 --> 18:15.000
(yells)

18:15.095 --> 18:17.711
Try harder.

18:17.806 --> 18:20.172
Anger will not serve you.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.055
Find your path.

18:26.064 --> 18:27.429
(yells)

18:31.695 --> 18:33.276
(yells)

18:35.865 --> 18:37.947
Release your mind.

18:45.917 --> 18:47.248
(yells)

18:50.630 --> 18:53.372
Stop it now!

18:54.217 --> 18:56.253
I'll kill you!

18:56.344 --> 18:58.050
(yells)

19:03.351 --> 19:07.720
To exert even a microt
of self-control over your
personal impulses

19:07.814 --> 19:10.021
is the point of the exercise.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.688
I'm leaving.

19:18.783 --> 19:21.195
That won't provide you with
the answers you seek.

19:21.286 --> 19:22.617
What answers?

19:22.704 --> 19:23.989
What questions?

19:24.080 --> 19:26.116
Look, I'm not playing any more
of your stupid games,

19:26.207 --> 19:29.335
and I do not need to be reminded
of my mental limitations!

19:29.419 --> 19:31.876
If I stay here,
I will kill Macton!

19:31.963 --> 19:35.376
I... will... kill this man!

19:40.930 --> 19:42.136
You see?

19:42.223 --> 19:44.760
You can control your anger.

19:47.270 --> 19:49.261
You have no limitations.

20:04.788 --> 20:07.154
Ahh! Ahh.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.289
Damn.

20:15.840 --> 20:17.421
Hey!

20:18.385 --> 20:19.921
D'Argo!

20:22.263 --> 20:24.390
Can anybody hear me?!

20:25.642 --> 20:28.349
This must be detention then.

20:38.613 --> 20:41.696
Hey, it's getting kind
of ripe in here.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.774
Macton is lying.

20:43.868 --> 20:44.903
How do you know?

20:44.994 --> 20:47.121
Because he's a Peacekeeper.

20:47.205 --> 20:49.366
Because he has to be.

20:49.457 --> 20:54.872
Look, he's trying to get to
you, and it's working.

20:54.963 --> 20:57.921
Lo'Laan and I were
happy together.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.134
He can't change that.
I won't let him.

21:00.218 --> 21:03.176
He's definitely getting to you.

21:04.848 --> 21:06.304
Ishould've killed him.

21:06.391 --> 21:10.179
Isn't that what you set out to
do when we all left Moya?

21:10.270 --> 21:15.014
Part of me knew it wouldn't
bring Lo'Laan back.

21:15.108 --> 21:20.853
Another part couldn't resist
letting him know that I knew
exactly where he was.

21:20.947 --> 21:25.111
Pay attention to the part
that wants to kill him.

21:25.201 --> 21:29.240
He's given you a second chance
to take your revenge.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.161
I'm not sure I want to.

21:31.249 --> 21:32.989
For yotz sake!

21:33.084 --> 21:36.247
Kill him and be done with it.

21:39.841 --> 21:44.835
(whistles "Colonel
Bogey March")

21:54.397 --> 21:55.728
Are you real?

21:55.815 --> 21:57.271
Are you?

21:57.358 --> 21:59.440
Oh, riddles.

21:59.527 --> 22:01.028
Riddle me this, riddle me that.

22:01.112 --> 22:02.693
I have one.

22:02.780 --> 22:06.739
Why is it neverjust the heat.
It's the humidity?

22:06.826 --> 22:09.818
While you're pondering that,
why don't you let me
the hell outta here.

22:09.913 --> 22:11.528
As you wish.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.072
One thing first.

22:17.337 --> 22:19.373
Here's a key.

22:22.634 --> 22:25.296
You weren't quick enough.

22:25.386 --> 22:28.219
Get a key and you may come out.

22:31.226 --> 22:34.969
( whistles )

22:48.618 --> 22:50.779
I'll say this just once.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.529
Stay away from me.

22:53.623 --> 22:56.160
Stay away from my friends.

22:56.251 --> 22:57.991
And stop spreading your lies.

22:58.086 --> 23:00.202
I'm not the one lying.
-Oh, you're full of dren.

23:00.296 --> 23:01.797
You've always hated me.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.748
You'd have hated any
non-Sebacean who married
your sister.

23:04.842 --> 23:09.256
I may have come to accept the
marriage, until you started
beating her.

23:13.977 --> 23:18.562
I'm violent when
I choose to be.

23:19.941 --> 23:25.857
And right now, I choose
not to kill you.

23:27.490 --> 23:29.071
But that could change.

23:29.158 --> 23:31.444
Really?

23:31.536 --> 23:34.994
Well, if I chose to kill you,
you'd never see me coming.

23:35.081 --> 23:37.288
No, I came to give
you the truth.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.581
Dren.

23:38.668 --> 23:41.125
The truth your blackouts
stopped you from seeing.

23:41.212 --> 23:44.204
That poor Lo'Laan stopped
you from seeing.

23:44.299 --> 23:45.755
You're full of dren.

23:45.842 --> 23:48.128
Am I lying about your hyperrage?

23:48.219 --> 23:51.256
Am I lying about your blackouts?

23:51.347 --> 23:55.340
I say even a stupid Luxan should
be able to see the truth.

23:55.435 --> 23:57.050
You're full of lies!

23:59.230 --> 24:00.640
D'Argo, no.

24:01.441 --> 24:02.851
Look at you.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.977
Your uncontrollable rage.

24:07.739 --> 24:11.197
Your violence.

24:11.284 --> 24:14.321
You really think you'd be able
to protect Lo'Laan from that?

24:15.580 --> 24:17.866
No.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.494
You must have known the truth.

24:20.585 --> 24:22.826
You've always known.

24:29.052 --> 24:30.588
(clinking)
(sizzling)

24:30.678 --> 24:32.418
(yelling with pain)

24:34.307 --> 24:35.922
Son of a...

24:39.646 --> 24:41.182
You'd better have a key.

24:41.272 --> 24:44.605
Katoya informs me you've been
experiencing some setbacks.

24:44.692 --> 24:47.604
He tell you who sicced that
critter on my family?

24:47.695 --> 24:49.811
That is relatively unimportant.

24:49.906 --> 24:51.191
It's important to me.

24:51.282 --> 24:53.113
Because it was unsuccessful.

24:53.201 --> 24:55.943
That's okay, then.
I don't need to be in here.

24:56.037 --> 24:58.699
If Earth is safe,
everything's fine.

24:58.790 --> 25:01.281
No, Earth is not safe.

25:01.376 --> 25:04.914
And neither are you.
The Scarrans know you exist.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.120
They are already coming
for you, John.

25:07.215 --> 25:12.710
You cannot run away for your
whole life, and I cannot
protect you from them.

25:12.804 --> 25:16.262
Little Cat A, I don't want
you to protect me

25:16.349 --> 25:21.139
because Little Cat B, you
haven't been doing such
a bang-up job of that in the first place,

25:21.229 --> 25:25.643
which brings us to
Little Cat C, get me
the hell out of this hole!

25:31.030 --> 25:34.693
You are undergoing a very
specific training.

25:34.784 --> 25:36.194
Anti-Scarran Training.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.321
Well, I figured that
out already.

25:39.622 --> 25:41.863
It's not the heat.

25:41.958 --> 25:43.869
It's the humidity!

25:43.960 --> 25:49.500
The heat mechanisms the
Scarran employs is just
the beginning, John.

25:50.925 --> 25:54.133
If that heat succeeds in
disabling your mind's defenses,

25:54.220 --> 26:01.467
there is no fact, no fear, no
deep secret that they will
be unable to extract.

26:01.561 --> 26:04.223
I'll take my chances on
my own, thank you.

26:05.523 --> 26:08.014
You misunderstand my
objectives, John.

26:08.109 --> 26:11.146
Without Katoya's training,
when the Scarrans find you,

26:11.237 --> 26:15.230
they will take your wormhole
knowledge and then they
will kill you.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.315
I could never allow that.

26:18.286 --> 26:20.527
Oh, Scorpy-Sue.

26:20.621 --> 26:23.328
After all we've meant
to each other.

26:23.416 --> 26:25.702
You'd kill me first.

26:25.793 --> 26:30.708
You... have such a limited
mental capacity, John.

26:30.798 --> 26:35.792
But apparently, an abundant
will to prevail.

26:37.388 --> 26:40.972
Well, my advice to you is
to use that will right
here, right now!

26:41.058 --> 26:47.179
Katoya is the only one that
can give you the tools to
resist the Scarrans.

26:47.273 --> 26:52.233
(whistling "Colonel
Bogey March")

26:52.320 --> 26:55.312
Katoya:
Your Crichton may not
survive the training.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.271
Scorpius:
Oh, he will.

26:57.366 --> 26:59.903
He is like me in that respect.

26:59.994 --> 27:03.452
He'll survive.

27:03.539 --> 27:09.250
For you to have survived
so long, my teachings must
have been helpful.

27:12.256 --> 27:16.169
They've saved my life,

27:16.260 --> 27:18.842
on countless occasions.

27:20.306 --> 27:25.266
I attempted to teach you to
overcome your need for a cooled
suit.

27:26.896 --> 27:31.105
And yet, you still have
use of one.

27:31.192 --> 27:33.274
One can always learn more.

27:37.073 --> 27:41.533
I request three favors.

27:41.619 --> 27:44.235
Do I owe so many?

27:44.330 --> 27:50.701
I did spare you from both
Peacekeeper captivity
and my Aurora Chair.

27:50.795 --> 27:53.628
I would have survived
your Aurora Chair.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.670
( inhales deeply)

27:56.133 --> 27:58.419
Proceed.

27:58.511 --> 28:03.380
Firstly, intensify
Crichton's training.

28:04.809 --> 28:06.595
Even if it kills him?

28:06.686 --> 28:11.430
Without the training,
he will die anyway.

28:12.650 --> 28:17.644
Secondly, Macton has
become a distraction.

28:18.364 --> 28:20.025
Maybe a dangerous one.

28:20.116 --> 28:21.652
He has done nothing wrong.

28:21.742 --> 28:24.825
I believe despite his protests,
he will kill D'Argo.

28:24.912 --> 28:27.289
Or D'Argo will kill him.

28:28.124 --> 28:29.785
I will have neither here.

28:29.876 --> 28:35.587
Still, some preemptive action
could be called for.

28:35.673 --> 28:37.004
Third?

28:37.091 --> 28:40.424
Information, about a species
I have no knowledge of.

28:40.511 --> 28:44.720
This... species...

28:44.807 --> 28:46.638
has recently attacked Crichton.

28:46.726 --> 28:50.935
May I describe it for you?

28:57.612 --> 28:59.773
(coals sizzling )

29:00.281 --> 29:01.817
(clinking)

29:03.075 --> 29:05.782
(grunts, then yells)

29:05.870 --> 29:08.031
John, you okay?

29:08.831 --> 29:10.412
Hey man, help me...

29:10.499 --> 29:13.161
Get this thing open.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.287
( grate creaking )

29:14.378 --> 29:16.289
(grunting)

29:16.380 --> 29:17.586
( groans )

29:17.673 --> 29:19.049
(huffing)

29:19.133 --> 29:20.464
That didn't budge, did it?

29:20.551 --> 29:24.339
It's gonna need at least a
Qualta or a Pulse Grenade.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.263
Here. I brought you
something to drink.

29:27.350 --> 29:29.762
(coals sizzling )

29:29.852 --> 29:32.559
Thanks.
-Listen, John,

29:32.647 --> 29:34.729
this is really doing
my head in.

29:34.815 --> 29:37.147
I've spent thinking about
killing Macton for half my life.

29:37.234 --> 29:39.725
That's a hell of a thing, man.

29:39.820 --> 29:42.653
Look, if you get me out of
here, I'll kill him for
you, all right?

29:42.740 --> 29:43.946
No, no, I can kill him.

29:44.033 --> 29:47.116
Frell knows I've wanted to,
but, uh...

29:47.203 --> 29:49.285
what if Lo'Laan lied?

29:49.372 --> 29:54.787
She lied about the blackouts,
then perhaps without
knowing or remembering,

29:54.877 --> 29:56.788
I hit my wife.

29:56.879 --> 29:58.494
Don't go there.

29:58.589 --> 30:00.045
That's Macton talking.

30:00.132 --> 30:03.920
I am there, John.
If that's possible,

30:04.011 --> 30:06.297
then more...
-D'Argo,

30:06.389 --> 30:09.802
many things are possible.

30:09.892 --> 30:13.885
Macton is just filling you
with possibilities.

30:15.189 --> 30:17.805
What Lo'Laan did...

30:18.859 --> 30:21.020
and that's what matters.

30:21.112 --> 30:24.775
Whatever she did,
she did for you.

30:24.865 --> 30:26.275
That's what's important.

30:26.367 --> 30:27.948
And that means something.

30:28.035 --> 30:34.122
That means... that it's
possible I killed the woman

30:34.208 --> 30:37.371
who loved me more than life.

30:44.677 --> 30:46.258
( inhales deeply)

30:46.345 --> 30:47.881
( exhales )

30:52.268 --> 30:54.304
Um....

30:56.272 --> 30:58.263
it probably won't be apparent
from my actions,

30:58.357 --> 31:01.724
but I really do have a
great deal of respect
for your work here.

31:04.447 --> 31:08.486
I'm sure many warriors
have been made great
from your teachings.

31:09.827 --> 31:12.034
I just won't be one of them.

31:12.121 --> 31:15.158
Do not sell yourself short.

31:15.249 --> 31:18.116
Mental strength is, uh...

31:19.587 --> 31:22.329
well, it's not my strength.
I know that.

31:23.424 --> 31:25.415
That's why I've come to you.

31:26.427 --> 31:28.634
Your mind is troubled?

31:29.430 --> 31:31.341
Whose isn't?

31:34.727 --> 31:36.592
Can you help me...

31:36.687 --> 31:38.723
find an answer?

31:43.360 --> 31:45.225
What would you like to know?

31:46.614 --> 31:50.072
What kind of monster
I really am.

31:54.830 --> 31:57.446
This need not be difficult.

31:57.541 --> 32:00.248
But it probably will be.

32:04.131 --> 32:06.417
Where do we start?

32:07.384 --> 32:09.340
What would you like to see?

32:09.428 --> 32:10.588
I, uh...

32:10.679 --> 32:12.670
(gasping)

32:14.725 --> 32:16.681
I don't wanna see that.

32:18.229 --> 32:20.265
Stay focused.

32:20.356 --> 32:23.393
I realize this is difficult.

32:23.484 --> 32:25.896
Lo'Laan:
I know this upsets you.

32:28.364 --> 32:30.150
(gasps )

32:31.909 --> 32:34.400
I know this upsets you, too.

32:34.495 --> 32:36.781
We'll get through it.

32:36.872 --> 32:39.079
You're upsetting yourself
over nothing.

32:39.166 --> 32:40.372
(hissing)

32:40.459 --> 32:41.244
D'Argo?

32:41.335 --> 32:42.370
(shallow breathing )

32:42.461 --> 32:43.667
D'Argo!

32:43.754 --> 32:45.210
Can you hear me?

32:45.297 --> 32:49.540
Katoya:
Hyperrage is a natural function
of Luxan physiology.

32:49.635 --> 32:52.126
But it's a function to be
controlled, not flaunted.

32:52.221 --> 32:54.257
Not to be used against
someone you love.

32:54.348 --> 32:55.178
Can you hear me?

32:55.266 --> 32:56.631
Did you use it against her?

32:56.725 --> 32:57.430
I don't know.

32:57.518 --> 32:58.473
But you want to know.

32:58.561 --> 32:59.641
Can you hear me?!

32:59.728 --> 33:01.389
No.
-But you came here to know.

33:01.480 --> 33:02.344
Can you hear me?

33:02.439 --> 33:03.303
No!

33:03.399 --> 33:04.309
Oh!

33:05.734 --> 33:07.861
(panting)

33:09.947 --> 33:11.403
I hit her.

33:11.490 --> 33:13.230
(exhales sharply)

33:16.245 --> 33:18.486
Did I hurt you?

33:19.456 --> 33:21.196
No.

33:25.629 --> 33:28.245
But you'd tell me?

33:28.340 --> 33:30.456
Promise me you would, please.

33:31.218 --> 33:34.255
You never hurt me, D'Argo.

33:36.223 --> 33:38.885
You promised you'd tell me.

33:48.569 --> 33:50.935
Why didn't you tell me?

33:52.865 --> 33:55.902
Don't you know how much
I loved you?

33:57.453 --> 33:59.239
Yes.

34:00.039 --> 34:02.030
( crashing )

34:15.638 --> 34:18.926
Sorry to interrupt, Master.

34:40.955 --> 34:43.196
Ka D'Argo.

34:46.418 --> 34:49.205
Time to revisit your memories.

34:53.384 --> 34:54.920
What have you done with Katoya?

34:55.010 --> 34:57.296
I refocused his energies.

35:00.349 --> 35:01.338
Hello, sister.

35:01.433 --> 35:02.809
( hisses )

35:03.894 --> 35:05.680
Welcome home.

35:06.814 --> 35:08.600
Scene of the crime.

35:10.609 --> 35:12.816
Scene of your many crimes.

35:12.903 --> 35:14.063
(yelling)

35:15.614 --> 35:17.855
Lo'Laan:
D'Argo, no!

35:17.950 --> 35:20.191
Macton:
Just like before.

35:21.954 --> 35:23.694
That never happened.

35:25.332 --> 35:28.290
Lo'Laan:
Go ahead, hit her.

35:28.377 --> 35:30.789
( Macton's voice):
Never a problem for you
when she was alive.

35:30.879 --> 35:32.130
No, I never meant to.

35:32.214 --> 35:35.297
( Lo'Laan's voice ):
Oh. Never meant to do this?

35:37.303 --> 35:38.839
Orthis.

35:38.929 --> 35:40.260
Orthis.

35:40.973 --> 35:42.179
Hy-hyperrage.

35:42.266 --> 35:43.551
It was you.

35:43.642 --> 35:46.349
Because you couldn't
control yourself.

35:46.437 --> 35:48.223
Because you were weak!

35:57.489 --> 35:59.195
Recognize the place?

35:59.283 --> 36:00.989
Your cell.

36:01.076 --> 36:03.738
Not here. Not now.

36:03.829 --> 36:05.114
Not like this.

36:05.205 --> 36:08.038
Where else?
This is where you belong.

36:08.125 --> 36:09.285
You're a wild beast.

36:09.376 --> 36:10.582
A mad dog.

36:10.669 --> 36:12.045
( hisses )

36:16.884 --> 36:18.920
You've earned those chains.

36:19.511 --> 36:21.923
And worse.

36:22.014 --> 36:23.504
(clinking)

36:24.933 --> 36:26.264
(gasps )

36:26.352 --> 36:27.808
(clinking)

36:29.438 --> 36:31.099
( screams )

36:32.691 --> 36:35.103
How's it feel to be helpless?

36:37.654 --> 36:39.235
Defenseless?

36:40.407 --> 36:42.648
This is what you did to Lo'Laan.

36:46.038 --> 36:48.324
This is what your
rage felt like.

36:49.958 --> 36:53.667
Rage that destroyed a
beautiful girl.

37:05.307 --> 37:06.843
Come on.

37:12.272 --> 37:13.352
(clinking)

37:13.440 --> 37:15.817
Ha! Gotcha!

37:16.819 --> 37:19.231
( screams )

37:19.321 --> 37:21.437
(grunting)

37:23.409 --> 37:26.492
( screaming )

37:29.415 --> 37:31.155
I didn't kill Lo'Laan.

37:31.250 --> 37:34.242
No. No, you did much worse.

37:34.336 --> 37:37.669
Your violence drove her
to her death.

37:49.184 --> 37:50.435
No.

37:53.147 --> 37:54.478
No...

37:54.565 --> 37:58.274
You beat her beyond her
capacity to endure anymore.

37:59.069 --> 38:00.354
Oh, no.

38:04.199 --> 38:06.485
But I got there first.

38:06.577 --> 38:08.283
I doctored the scene.

38:08.370 --> 38:12.579
Provided the evidence that
put you in prison.

38:14.209 --> 38:15.540
To rot forever.

38:15.627 --> 38:18.744
(sobbing)

38:20.007 --> 38:23.591
Don't try to resist.
It's my gift to you, D'Argo.

38:23.677 --> 38:28.637
Your own hyperrage in a place
where you can rot in it forever.

38:28.724 --> 38:34.139
Just you and your
hyperrage for eternity.

38:34.229 --> 38:37.938
(yelling turns to screaming)

38:38.025 --> 38:39.981
Focus.

38:40.068 --> 38:41.933
( D'Argo's screaming
continues )

38:46.241 --> 38:47.742
Focus.

38:49.286 --> 38:50.366
No.

39:22.402 --> 39:24.939
You're lying.

39:25.030 --> 39:27.487
Every word you've said
is a lie.

39:27.574 --> 39:29.280
No.

39:29.368 --> 39:31.279
You beat her and you
killed her.

39:31.370 --> 39:33.326
You know the truth.

39:33.413 --> 39:37.326
You never knew Lo'Laan and
you knew nothing about love.

39:48.053 --> 39:50.965
I know what Lo'Laan went
through for our love.

39:54.017 --> 39:56.349
Oh, you loved her to death.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.356
You do not have this power.

40:03.443 --> 40:08.278
Lo'Laan told me that I do have
power over my hyperrage.

40:08.365 --> 40:11.027
And it's more than enough
to control you in here.

40:11.118 --> 40:13.985
Oh, you cannot kill me.
Not in here.

40:14.079 --> 40:16.240
I have no intention
of killing you.

40:18.041 --> 40:20.202
I loved my wife.

40:21.461 --> 40:23.497
But you wouldn't know that.

40:23.589 --> 40:25.329
You didn't know Lo'Laan.

40:26.341 --> 40:28.206
Idid.

40:28.302 --> 40:31.294
She could have left me for my
failings. Maybe she should have.

40:31.388 --> 40:32.673
But I know this.

40:32.764 --> 40:38.054
She would never have left her
son without a mother.

40:44.067 --> 40:45.318
So...

40:45.402 --> 40:48.314
I want you to show me
your memories.

40:48.405 --> 40:53.650
And tell me why you
killed Lo'Laan.

40:53.744 --> 40:57.282
Trying to save her from you.

40:57.372 --> 41:02.116
D'Argo will be dishonorably
discharged. Jailed for
as long as you need.

41:02.210 --> 41:03.620
But he's done nothing wrong.

41:03.712 --> 41:06.294
He has done everything wrong.

41:06.381 --> 41:08.588
You'll thank me for
this, sister.

41:11.345 --> 41:13.301
(gasps )

41:14.389 --> 41:16.550
It was your fault.

41:16.642 --> 41:18.382
She attacked me.

41:18.477 --> 41:20.934
My reflexes took control.

41:21.021 --> 41:23.137
My Peacekeeper training.

41:23.231 --> 41:25.358
It was over before I realized.

41:30.197 --> 41:32.233
D'Argo:
It's not the truth.

41:33.367 --> 41:35.403
Not the whole truth.

41:36.536 --> 41:38.697
She was beaten.

41:40.207 --> 41:42.448
It was your fault she died.

41:43.585 --> 41:45.746
You had to pay.

41:46.880 --> 41:50.372
I had to make you pay.

41:50.467 --> 41:55.131
I had to make it look like you'd
done it in a fit of hyperrage.

41:55.222 --> 41:58.134
Had to make sure you
were blamed.

43:07.961 --> 43:10.122
You okay?

43:10.213 --> 43:11.874
I'm fine.

43:11.965 --> 43:15.549
You want me to drive?
-No, I'm fine.

43:15.635 --> 43:20.470
Rygel:
If you were fine, you'd have
killed Macton instead of leaving him there.

43:20.557 --> 43:24.175
He's trapped in a coma with
his own nightmares.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.726
Killing him would have
been merciful.

43:26.813 --> 43:29.099
I'm not that enlightened.

43:32.235 --> 43:34.521
So tell me, John.

43:35.614 --> 43:38.731
Were you able to
obtain the key?

43:38.825 --> 43:42.283
(whistles "Colonel
Bogey March")

43:42.370 --> 43:47.160
Incidentally, that creature
that attacked you on Earth.

43:47.250 --> 43:50.617
It might interest you to know
it is called a Skreeth.

43:50.712 --> 43:55.547
Apparently it can communicate
telepathically over
vast distances.

43:55.634 --> 43:57.295
Yeah, Katoya give you that?

43:57.385 --> 43:59.341
If it did map Earth's location,

43:59.429 --> 44:02.045
it may well have passed
on that information.

44:02.140 --> 44:04.222
Who would it pass it on to?

44:05.435 --> 44:08.051
Grayza, almost certainly.

44:09.231 --> 44:11.688
So the Peacekeepers know
where Earth is.

44:11.775 --> 44:13.606
May know.

44:15.278 --> 44:16.734
Would Grayza go there?

44:16.822 --> 44:18.904
Eventually, perhaps.

44:19.616 --> 44:23.484
Grayza does not want Earth.

44:23.578 --> 44:27.241
Grayza wants you.

44:29.501 --> 44:32.163
Why do I always attract
the psychos?

44:36.341 --> 44:38.957
Hey man, you sure you're okay?

44:40.470 --> 44:42.552
Yeah, I'll be fine. I've...

44:42.639 --> 44:44.846
got things on my mind.

44:46.268 --> 44:48.224
Things I've done.

44:49.312 --> 44:51.849
Things I can't take back.
