MacGYVER: There's nothing like
waking up at home for a change.

01:33.159 --> 01:36.663
Take a look around my own world, sort of

01:36.663 --> 01:40.166
ease into the day.

01:43.169 --> 01:44.671
Not much scheduled.

01:44.671 --> 01:46.673
A guy's supposed to drop by

01:46.673 --> 01:50.176
and see me about some upcoming business.

02:01.688 --> 02:05.191
There has got to be a gigantic
secret factory somewhere

02:05.191 --> 02:08.193
putting out nothing but junk mail.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.709
Nice car.

02:22.709 --> 02:25.712
Sporty. Not too outlandish.

02:25.712 --> 02:28.715
The kind a young architect might drive.

02:28.715 --> 02:31.217
This could be my 10:00 appointment.

02:38.224 --> 02:40.727
Frank Bennet? Are you MacGyver?

02:40.727 --> 02:42.228
Yeah.

02:43.229 --> 02:45.231
How you doing?

02:47.233 --> 02:48.234
Want some coffee?

02:48.735 --> 02:50.236
Yeah.

02:50.236 --> 02:52.238
Sit down.

02:52.238 --> 02:53.740
Black?

02:53.740 --> 02:57.243
. Yeah, that's good--
as long as it's strong

02:57.243 --> 03:00.246
It's guaranteed to melt lead.

03:03.249 --> 03:04.751
You don't look like a, uh,

03:05.251 --> 03:07.754
hotshot expert on personal security.

03:07.754 --> 03:10.757
Well, I don't feel like one,
either, but I've done it before.

03:11.257 --> 03:12.258
Can you make me disappear?

03:12.258 --> 03:13.760
I'm sure gonna try.

03:14.260 --> 03:17.263
Take you to a new place,
start you on a new life.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.265
But this Federal marshal,
this Wiley, tells me

03:19.766 --> 03:22.268
you're gonna testify before
the Crime Commission first.

03:22.769 --> 03:25.271
t. No, I haven't deci
ded about that. Not ye

03:25.271 --> 03:27.774
Where's Wiley? He's
supposed to meet us here.

03:27.774 --> 03:29.776
Try to enjoy your coffee for a second.

03:29.776 --> 03:32.278
I'll give him a call
and see what's happening.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.286
(tires squeal)

03:44.791 --> 03:47.794
(grunting)

03:48.795 --> 03:50.797
Come on, get him in the car!

03:57.303 --> 04:00.807
(tires screeching)

04:32.338 --> 04:35.341
MacGYVER: So much for
easing into the day.

04:35.341 --> 04:36.843
Joey just wants to talk to you.

04:36.843 --> 04:39.345
Yeah, well, if my brother
wants to talk to me,

04:39.345 --> 04:40.346
he can call me on the phone.

04:40.847 --> 04:43.349
I don't need this, Max!

04:43.349 --> 04:45.852
Joey needs it.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.353
Now, be nice, Frank.

04:49.355 --> 04:51.357
Now, technically, I'm driving

04:51.357 --> 04:55.862
a stolen car following a kidnapping...

04:55.862 --> 04:59.365
and I still haven't had
my first cup of coffee.

04:59.365 --> 05:01.367
I got a headache.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.899
Okay, let's go.

05:53.419 --> 05:54.921
Where's Joey?

05:54.921 --> 05:57.423
Oh, he'll be here.

05:57.423 --> 06:00.927
Uh... want a cup of coffee?

06:00.927 --> 06:01.928
No.

06:32.458 --> 06:35.461
(car approaching)

06:57.984 --> 07:00.486
?? ??

07:29.515 --> 07:32.018
?? ??

07:44.530 --> 07:45.531
Hello, Frank.

07:45.531 --> 07:46.532
Joey.

07:47.033 --> 07:49.035
You're mad. I can understand that.

07:49.535 --> 07:50.536
Hey, be polite.

07:51.037 --> 07:52.538
Gonna say hello to your Uncle Vincent?

07:53.039 --> 07:55.041
Sure. When do we serve tea?

07:55.041 --> 07:56.542
(mocking): "When do we serve tea?"

07:56.542 --> 07:59.045
Frankie, don't be like that.

07:59.045 --> 08:00.546
You and
Joey--

08:00.546 --> 08:02.548
look at one another.

08:02.548 --> 08:04.550
Bone, blood, flesh.

08:04.550 --> 08:05.551
Brothe rs.

08:06.052 --> 08:07.053
Why is it necessary to argue?

08:07.553 --> 08:08.554
Listen to Vincent.

08:08.554 --> 08:10.556
There shouldn't be
grievances in the family.

08:10.556 --> 08:12.558
FRANK: If this is about the family...

08:12.558 --> 08:16.062
Good point. Give us a
little privacy, guys.

08:18.564 --> 08:20.566
d Okay, what's so damn
urgent you have to sen

08:20.566 --> 08:22.068
a couple leg-break ers after me?

08:22.068 --> 08:24.070
, JOEY: I call your apartmen
t, I called your office

08:24.570 --> 08:26.572
ck. I left messages,
y ou never called me ba

08:26.572 --> 08:28.074
That's not nice, Frank.

08:28.074 --> 08:30.076
We're brothers, Jo ey. It's just a word.

08:30.076 --> 08:32.578
go. It stopped meaning
anything a long time a

08:32.578 --> 08:34.580
. I'm not in the family anymore

08:34.580 --> 08:35.581
You can't deny your blood.

08:35.581 --> 08:37.082
We have the same father.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.083
FRANK: He was a butcher
in Eastern Europe,

08:38.083 --> 08:39.585
he's a butcher here.

08:39.585 --> 08:40.586
Would you have said that

08:40.586 --> 08:42.087
to his face when he was alive?

08:42.087 --> 08:44.590
s. No, I wouldn't have had the gut

08:44.590 --> 08:46.592
(chuckles)

08:49.595 --> 08:52.598
(sighs): We also have the same mother...

08:52.598 --> 08:54.600
who, by the way, is in the hospital.

08:54.600 --> 08:57.603
I know. I visi ted her last week.

08:57.603 --> 08:59.105
JOEY: She fades in and out.

08:59.105 --> 09:01.607
Oh, I don't know, Frank,

09:01.607 --> 09:03.109
half the time she doesn't
know what's going on.

09:03.609 --> 09:05.611
I guess that's why you think
you can put a knife in me,

09:05.611 --> 09:07.613
in the family, talking
to the Crime Commission.

09:08.114 --> 09:09.615
ey. I haven't talk ed to anybody, Jo

09:09.615 --> 09:12.618
No?

09:12.618 --> 09:15.621
Maybe you want to read the
transcript of the phone conversation.

09:16.122 --> 09:17.623
Hey,theytalked tome.

09:17.623 --> 09:19.125
And you listened...

09:19.125 --> 09:20.626
very good.

09:20.626 --> 09:24.130
All the garbage about...
being a solid citizen.

09:24.130 --> 09:27.133
They're after me,
Frank. They're after me.

09:27.133 --> 09:29.135
Okay, Joey, you're right, I did listen.

09:29.135 --> 09:30.636
You want to know why?

09:30.636 --> 09:33.139
'Cause they talked about
your rotten drug business.

09:33.639 --> 09:34.140
My rotten drug business!

09:34.640 --> 09:35.641
So what, are you offended?

09:36.142 --> 09:38.144
And it's notmyrotten drug
business, it's yours, too.

09:38.144 --> 09:39.645
It's part of our family.

09:39.645 --> 09:40.646
Let me ask you this:

09:40.646 --> 09:42.648
When did you get this sudden conversion?

09:42.648 --> 09:43.649
I mean, why now?

09:44.150 --> 09:47.653
Two weeks ago, a kid in my office died.

09:47.653 --> 09:52.158
OD'd on tailor-made poison,
Joey-- the stuff that you sell!

09:52.158 --> 09:53.159
d, He was a good ki

09:53.159 --> 09:54.160
and you killed him!

09:54.660 --> 09:56.162
I understand that, but...

09:56.662 --> 09:58.164
Frank, it happens.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.166
That's life. It's just business.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.168
FRANK: Joey... look, shut it down.

10:02.168 --> 10:03.669
Shut the drug business down.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.672
Cut it off, and I will
do whatever you want.

10:06.672 --> 10:08.174
JOEY: Shut it down?

10:08.174 --> 10:09.675
Frank, I got a payroll.

10:09.675 --> 10:12.178
I got responsibilities.

10:12.678 --> 10:14.180
I'm the head of the
family, but only so long

10:14.180 --> 10:15.681
as I take care of business.

10:15.681 --> 10:17.683
It's not like shutting
down a hot dog stand.

10:17.683 --> 10:20.186
We're talking about $100
million-a-year gross.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.188
Match that against the dead kid.

10:22.188 --> 10:23.689
Who made him hit the stuff?

10:24.190 --> 10:26.192
He wanted it, he bought it.

10:26.192 --> 10:27.193
It was his choice.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.195
I simply provide the service.

10:29.695 --> 10:31.197
Someone's gonna do it.

10:33.199 --> 10:37.703
. Joey, sometimes yo
u make me so ashamed

10:39.205 --> 10:40.706
You're ashamed of me?

10:41.207 --> 10:42.708
You?

10:45.211 --> 10:48.714
Spilling it to a Federal marshal?

10:48.714 --> 10:49.715
You've had it easy, Frank,

10:49.715 --> 10:52.218
and you know a lot of
pieces of the operation.

10:52.218 --> 10:53.719
We can't trust you,

10:53.719 --> 10:55.721
and we can't let you walk away.

11:00.726 --> 11:02.228
Joey...

11:03.729 --> 11:05.231
Then do it yourself!

11:12.738 --> 11:14.740
Come on, Max.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.253
FRANK: You enjoy this.

11:27.253 --> 11:29.255
You're so smart.

11:29.255 --> 11:32.258
Mr. College.

11:32.258 --> 11:33.759
Mr. Graduate School.

11:34.260 --> 11:36.762
All the while pretending you didn't
know where the money came from,

11:36.762 --> 11:38.764
just like Mama didn't want to know.

11:38.764 --> 11:42.268
Well, it came from Papa!

11:42.268 --> 11:43.769
It came from me!

11:43.769 --> 11:46.772
And you've had contempt!

11:46.772 --> 11:48.274
Now you want to sell us?

11:48.274 --> 11:49.775
Now you want to spill on us?

11:49.775 --> 11:51.777
(cocks gun)

11:52.778 --> 11:55.281
(electric saw whirring)

11:55.281 --> 11:57.283
(shouting)

11:57.283 --> 11:59.285
Turn it off! I can't see!

11:59.785 --> 12:01.787
Tommy! I can't see a thing!

12:02.288 --> 12:05.291
Frank! Frank!

12:05.291 --> 12:06.292
TOMMY: I'm blinded!

12:06.292 --> 12:08.294
JOEY: Max, Tommy, get after them!

12:19.305 --> 12:20.806
He's going to be right after us.

12:21.307 --> 12:21.807
(gunshot)

12:22.308 --> 12:23.309
Yeah.

12:23.309 --> 12:25.311
(gunshot)

12:28.314 --> 12:30.816
. Come on, Frank

12:36.822 --> 12:38.324
(gunshot)

12:38.324 --> 12:41.827
(tires squealing)

12:41.827 --> 12:43.329
Max...

12:43.329 --> 12:45.831
Get in the other car. Follow us.

12:45.831 --> 12:49.335
Right with you, Joey.

13:17.363 --> 13:19.365
How the hell did you know wh...?

13:19.365 --> 13:20.366
ut. I had to get you o

13:20.866 --> 13:22.868
e. You forgot to pay for your coffe

13:22.868 --> 13:26.372
(chuckles)

13:26.372 --> 13:27.873
You see who it was , the other guy?

13:28.374 --> 13:29.375
No.

13:29.375 --> 13:30.376
Well, get on it. I want Frank.

13:30.876 --> 13:32.378
We find him, we'll find his buddy, too.

13:32.378 --> 13:33.379
Joey, it might be more...

13:33.879 --> 13:34.880
I don't want legal advice, Vincent.

13:34.880 --> 13:35.881
I want 'em both dead.

13:55.401 --> 14:00.406
So, have you decided what you're
going to do about testifying?

14:00.406 --> 14:03.409
t. I guess you heard... all tha

14:03.909 --> 14:05.911
I saw your brother try to kill you.

14:06.412 --> 14:07.913
ah. Ye

14:07.913 --> 14:09.415
In spite of what I say, MacGyver,

14:09.415 --> 14:10.916
r, he's still my brothe

14:10.916 --> 14:12.418
still my family.

14:12.418 --> 14:13.919
So you're going to let him blow you away

14:13.919 --> 14:15.921
and keep selling that
junk to kids, is that it?

14:15.921 --> 14:17.423
Come on, MacGyver.

14:17.423 --> 14:19.425
That's what I hear, Frank.

14:19.425 --> 14:20.926
(intercom buzzes)

14:25.431 --> 14:26.932
ah. Ye

14:26.932 --> 14:29.435
MacGyver, this is Federal
Marshal Andrew Wiley.

14:32.438 --> 14:33.939
. Come on up

14:33.939 --> 14:37.443
That's our missing marshal.

14:37.443 --> 14:39.445
I've known you about an hour and a half.

14:39.445 --> 14:41.447
Who elected yo u my conscience?

14:41.447 --> 14:43.449
Well somebody's got to do it.

14:43.449 --> 14:44.950
Look, Frank,

14:45.451 --> 14:48.954
I know you're between the
proverbial rock and hard place.

14:48.954 --> 14:50.956
I guess I really don't
have a choice, huh?

14:51.457 --> 14:53.459
No. That makes it tough.

14:53.959 --> 14:56.462
(knocking at door)

14:58.464 --> 14:59.965
. Come on in

15:02.968 --> 15:05.971
I think I recognize
yo u by now, Marshal.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.973
Regulations.

15:07.973 --> 15:10.476
I hope you're willing to
accept our offer, Mr. Bennet.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.482
I am.

15:16.482 --> 15:17.483
But let me spell it out:

15:17.983 --> 15:19.985
ll. My father's dead. My mother's not we

15:19.985 --> 15:21.487
I'll tell you all you want to
know about the organization--

15:21.987 --> 15:24.490
about Joey's
drug operation--

15:24.490 --> 15:25.491
period.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.493
That's all we ask, all we need.

15:27.993 --> 15:28.994
What's the procedure?

15:28.994 --> 15:30.996
We'll take his deposition immediately,

15:30.996 --> 15:32.498
at the Crime Commission offices.

15:32.998 --> 15:35.000
Then you'll be moved to
a protected safe house

15:35.000 --> 15:35.501
until the hearing is over.

15:35.501 --> 15:37.002
Where?

15:37.002 --> 15:39.004
I'd rather nobody knew the address.

15:39.004 --> 15:40.005
Even him?

15:40.005 --> 15:41.507
It's okay, Frank. He's right.

15:42.007 --> 15:44.510
After the hearing is
done, MacGyver takes over,

15:44.510 --> 15:46.512
arranges relocation,
new identity--

15:46.512 --> 15:48.514
if you'll agree.

15:52.017 --> 15:53.018
I agree.

15:53.519 --> 15:56.522
Well, then, Mr. Bennet...

15:56.522 --> 15:58.023
ay. Ok

15:58.023 --> 16:00.526
I just want to make one stop on the way.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.027
I want to look in on my
mother at the hospital.

16:02.027 --> 16:04.029
That's a chance I'd rather not take.

16:04.029 --> 16:05.030
Frank,

16:05.030 --> 16:06.532
Joey's looking for you.

16:06.532 --> 16:08.534
Listen, MacGyv er, I
already owe you my life,

16:09.034 --> 16:10.035
so why not ask a favor?

16:10.035 --> 16:12.037
Could you check in on my
mother at the hospital?

16:12.538 --> 16:13.539
Tell her, uh...

16:13.539 --> 16:15.541
just tell her I'm all right

16:15.541 --> 16:18.043
and that I'll see her
first chance I get.

16:18.043 --> 16:20.546
Katerina Bennet, St. Matthews.

16:20.546 --> 16:22.047
Yeah, sure.

16:22.548 --> 16:26.051
Okay. I'm all yours.

16:28.554 --> 16:31.056
er. Tell Mama I love h

16:31.056 --> 16:34.059
.. Make her understand.

16:34.059 --> 16:36.061
. if you can

16:38.564 --> 16:40.566
Let's go, Frank.

16:44.069 --> 16:48.073
MacGYVER: Frank's testimony is
going to hurt Joey, Mrs. Bennet.

16:49.575 --> 16:52.077
Brother against brother.

16:52.077 --> 16:54.580
It's the only way to
stop Joey's drug trade.

16:54.580 --> 16:58.083
Tell Frankie t hat I understand.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.585
He must do what he must.

17:00.085 --> 17:02.588
? Can I share a secret
with you, Mr. MacGyver

17:02.588 --> 17:05.089
Something that Frank ie doesn't know?

17:05.089 --> 17:07.092
I'm going to die.

17:07.593 --> 17:10.596
I want to spea k to my son

17:10.596 --> 17:12.598
one more time.

17:12.598 --> 17:17.102
And the doctor says I
don't have much time left.

17:17.102 --> 17:19.104
Can you bring him here to see me?

17:19.104 --> 17:23.608
That might be a little
dangerous for Frank right now.

17:23.608 --> 17:27.112
... Please, Mr. MacGyv
er, tell... tell Frank

17:27.112 --> 17:31.116
m. just tell him I want to see hi

17:31.116 --> 17:33.619
er? Can you do that for me, Mr. MacGyv

17:33.619 --> 17:36.622
Yes, ma'am, I sure can.

17:52.137 --> 17:54.640
No trouble, right? Not here.

17:54.640 --> 17:55.641
But I owe you.

17:55.641 --> 17:57.643
me. I'd love to collect someti

17:57.643 --> 17:59.144
(chuckles)

17:59.645 --> 18:00.646
You got a name?

18:00.646 --> 18:02.648
s. Friend of Frank'

18:02.648 --> 18:05.150
Frank sent you here, huh?

18:05.150 --> 18:06.652
er. He's worried about his moth

18:07.152 --> 18:08.654
I'll worry about his mother.

18:08.654 --> 18:11.156
Tell Frank worry about his brother.

18:11.156 --> 18:12.658
And give him my love.

18:19.665 --> 18:22.167
MacGYVER: Federal courthouse.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.169
Wiley's office.

18:27.172 --> 18:30.175
Good place to start looking for Frank.

18:41.186 --> 18:42.688
Looks like somebody's all set

18:43.188 --> 18:45.691
for a quick getaway.

18:48.193 --> 18:49.695
(sighs)

18:49.695 --> 18:51.697
I do so declare that
everything I've said here

18:51.697 --> 18:54.199
is the truth as I know it.

18:54.199 --> 18:56.201
nk? Tired, Fra

19:00.706 --> 19:02.207
Yeah.

19:02.207 --> 19:03.709
You've earned a rest.

19:03.709 --> 19:06.211
He's earned some kind of award.

19:06.211 --> 19:09.214
My brother wants to
make the presentation.

19:09.214 --> 19:12.217
I'll bet-- considering
the kind of information

19:12.217 --> 19:13.218
you've just given us.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.723
I don't think you have
any idea how much it means.

19:17.723 --> 19:18.724
I think I do.

19:19.224 --> 19:20.726
Your brother Joey?

19:20.726 --> 19:23.729
It's quite a price to pay.

19:23.729 --> 19:25.731
(intercom buzzes)

19:25.731 --> 19:28.734
Wiley.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.736
Yeah. Tell him I'l l be right down.

19:30.736 --> 19:32.237
es. Frank, relax a couple minut

19:32.237 --> 19:33.238
. I'll be right back

19:43.749 --> 19:45.751
Marshal Wiley, how's it going?

19:45.751 --> 19:46.752
e. Just fin

19:47.252 --> 19:48.754
ces But we won't be needing your servi

19:48.754 --> 19:49.755
ks. for another couple wee

19:49.755 --> 19:50.756
No, I know that.

19:50.756 --> 19:53.258
I just have to get a message to Frank.

19:53.258 --> 19:55.260
From his mother?

19:55.761 --> 19:58.263
Yeah, as a matter of fact.

19:58.263 --> 19:59.765
. I can't allow that

20:04.269 --> 20:07.272
Wiley, his mother's dying.

20:07.272 --> 20:08.273
I know that.

20:08.273 --> 20:11.276
We're in communicati
on with the hospital.

20:11.777 --> 20:12.778
You know that?

20:12.778 --> 20:15.280
So why can't I talk to Frank?

20:15.781 --> 20:17.783
Because I don't want him to know it.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.288
Because he will insist on going there.

20:23.288 --> 20:24.790
t? Probably. So wha

20:24.790 --> 20:27.292
So, MacGyver, Joey Bennet
is not a sentimental man.

20:27.292 --> 20:28.293
He'd be happy to kill Frank

20:28.794 --> 20:30.295
right on their mother's deathbed.

20:31.797 --> 20:36.802
ou? Does the thought of securi
ty at the hospital occur to y

20:36.802 --> 20:38.303
I won't risk it.

20:38.303 --> 20:40.305
It's not your choi ce, it's Frank's.

20:40.305 --> 20:43.308
Not anymore. He's too valuable.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.811
Frank Bennet is no t Federal property.

20:45.811 --> 20:47.312
en. He's an American citiz

20:47.813 --> 20:50.816
And please feel free to
correct me if I'm wrong:

20:50.816 --> 20:53.318
. he has some rights

20:56.822 --> 20:58.824
And I promis ed his mother.

20:59.324 --> 21:01.827
. She knows she's dying, Wiley

21:01.827 --> 21:06.832
She thinks this is the last
time she'll ever see her son.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.333
I cannot allow it and that is final.

21:08.333 --> 21:09.334
And if necessary, MacGyver,

21:09.835 --> 21:10.836
I will put you under arrest

21:10.836 --> 21:13.839
and hold you as a material witness.

21:13.839 --> 21:15.340
it: Oh, I get

21:15.340 --> 21:17.843
! you're willing to break
the law in order to uphold it

21:17.843 --> 21:19.344
God...!

21:19.344 --> 21:23.348
Look, I got a mother, I got kids,

21:23.348 --> 21:25.851
I understand how Frank feels,

21:25.851 --> 21:28.353
but testimony like this
comes once in a lifetime.

21:28.854 --> 21:31.356
He has got to live to
testify in open session

21:31.356 --> 21:32.858
and I cannot risk losing him.

21:32.858 --> 21:35.360
? No matter what it does to him

21:35.861 --> 21:38.363
I don't like it...

21:38.363 --> 21:39.865
but I'm an officer of the law

21:40.365 --> 21:42.367
and I will do whatever is necessary

21:42.367 --> 21:43.869
to lock up these indictments.

21:43.869 --> 21:46.371
All right, Wil ey, relax, relax.

21:46.371 --> 21:48.373
Take a load off.

21:48.874 --> 21:51.376
I know a brick wall when it falls on me.

21:54.379 --> 21:56.381
You guys...

21:56.381 --> 21:58.383
I gotta warn you:

21:58.383 --> 22:00.385
I'm on Frank Bennet's side.

22:15.400 --> 22:17.903
Yeah, Acme Auto Tow Rental?

22:27.913 --> 22:31.416
MacGYVER: Lots of people
think a car runs on gas.

22:31.416 --> 22:34.920
Only one-third correct.

22:35.420 --> 22:39.925
A car also runs on air, and water.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.942
What'll it be?

22:56.942 --> 22:58.944
Soda.

22:58.944 --> 23:03.448
Got all kinds: cherry, cola,

23:03.448 --> 23:06.451
d. Mmm... a dozen, mixe

23:06.952 --> 23:08.954
A dozen, mixed.

23:09.454 --> 23:10.956
. Mixed in a box

23:10.956 --> 23:12.958
x? You got a bo

23:15.460 --> 23:18.463
Throw in some of that
ice there too, please.

23:18.463 --> 23:19.464
ce. It's dry i

23:19.464 --> 23:20.966
You can't put it in the drinks.

23:21.466 --> 23:23.969
I know.

23:23.969 --> 23:24.970
And I'm going to need some

23:25.470 --> 23:26.972
of these fizzy dealies here.

23:26.972 --> 23:29.474
Fizzy dealies.

23:29.474 --> 23:33.478
The thing I love about dry ice

23:33.478 --> 23:37.983
is that it's very reactive,
especially with a liquid.

23:56.001 --> 23:59.004
Now, to spice it up a little...

23:59.004 --> 24:02.507
(hissing, sputtering)

24:02.507 --> 24:05.010
(popping, crackling)

24:13.018 --> 24:15.020
The general idea here is:

24:15.020 --> 24:17.022
most people believe that
where there's smoke...

24:23.528 --> 24:24.529
MAN: Sally, get the...

24:24.529 --> 24:25.530
MAN 2: Wait a minute.

24:25.530 --> 24:28.033
Something's happening. Smoke.

24:28.033 --> 24:29.534
Oh, boy.

24:33.538 --> 24:34.539
Do you see the smoke?

24:35.040 --> 24:36.541
MAN (outside door) : Come on, quickly!

24:36.541 --> 24:38.543
Okay, hit the fire alarm,
evacuate the building.

24:38.543 --> 24:40.045
It's all through the building.

24:40.045 --> 24:41.046
It could be a move to get you.

24:41.046 --> 24:42.547
I'll check it out, but right now:

24:42.547 --> 24:44.049
Bridges, Larson, take Frank,

24:44.049 --> 24:45.550
move him to the safe house now.

24:45.550 --> 24:46.551
You got it.

24:46.551 --> 24:47.552
(alarm ringing)

24:48.053 --> 24:50.055
(clamoring)

24:50.055 --> 24:51.056
All right, come on.

24:51.056 --> 24:54.059
Wait up! Over here!

24:56.061 --> 24:58.063
(clamoring continues)

25:03.068 --> 25:04.069
Let's move it.

25:08.073 --> 25:12.077
(alarm continues ringing)

25:12.077 --> 25:14.079
Come this wa y. Quickly.

25:14.079 --> 25:16.081
? Quickly. Sally

25:26.091 --> 25:28.093
LARSON: Hey, Bridges,
know anything about cars?

25:28.593 --> 25:30.095
BRIDGES: Yeah, enough
to take it to a mechanic.

25:30.095 --> 25:31.096
ic. Terrif

25:31.596 --> 25:33.098
Pull it over, let me have a look.

25:33.598 --> 25:34.099
? Are you a mechanic

25:34.599 --> 25:35.100
You have a choice?

25:45.110 --> 25:46.111
Come on.

25:54.619 --> 25:56.621
This engine head looks like burnt toast.

26:00.125 --> 26:02.127
Hey, I think we got lucky, though.

26:04.629 --> 26:06.131
. Okay, stop

26:06.131 --> 26:08.133
! Stop! Stop

26:08.133 --> 26:09.634
Hey, hey, hey! Stop!

26:09.634 --> 26:10.635
Hey, hold it.

26:13.638 --> 26:14.639
What's the problem?

26:15.140 --> 26:16.141
w. We need a to

26:16.141 --> 26:18.143
Well, I'd like to help you guys out,

26:18.143 --> 26:19.144
but I'm on another call.

26:19.144 --> 26:21.146
We need a tow now!

26:21.146 --> 26:23.648
Always got time for a badge. No problem.

26:34.659 --> 26:36.661
o. Come on-- hey,
come on, let's g

26:37.662 --> 26:38.663
Come on back. Come on.

26:39.164 --> 26:40.665
Whoa! Easy!

26:44.669 --> 26:46.671
MacGYVER: What's tha t all about?

26:55.180 --> 26:56.681
Sorry about that.

27:02.187 --> 27:04.689
Ow.

27:04.689 --> 27:06.191
Now what's the problem?

27:06.191 --> 27:08.693
Oh, I've got this old stabilizer
arm on this hoist, here,

27:09.194 --> 27:11.696
and if I don't hook it up
just right, it's liable to rip

27:12.197 --> 27:14.199
the living rivets
right off your bumpe r.

27:14.199 --> 27:16.201
I keep trying to get a
new one of these things,

27:16.201 --> 27:18.703
. but think the company'd
shell out for it? Heck, no

27:18.703 --> 27:21.206
Do you mind getting on
with this, now? Please?

27:24.209 --> 27:26.711
With all due respect,sir,

27:27.212 --> 27:29.214
I do what I do

27:29.214 --> 27:31.716
the way I do it.

27:32.217 --> 27:33.718
, So, like I was saying

27:33.718 --> 27:35.220
I hooked this thin g up last week

27:35.220 --> 27:37.222
f! to this lady's bumpe
r and tore it clean of

27:37.222 --> 27:39.224
Clean. Clean.

27:39.224 --> 27:41.226
And holler? You should
have heard that lady.

27:41.226 --> 27:42.227
You could hear her...

27:42.227 --> 27:43.728
You're gonna hear me
holler, right here...

27:43.728 --> 27:44.729
Hey, hey. right now,

27:44.729 --> 27:45.730
if you don't get on with this.

27:45.730 --> 27:46.731
Now, do you hear that?

27:46.731 --> 27:48.233
I hear you.

27:48.233 --> 27:49.234
Come on, Larson.

27:49.234 --> 27:51.236
. But you can't rush
these things, you know

27:51.736 --> 27:53.738
Haste makes wa ste and all that.

27:54.239 --> 27:56.241
You boys want to m ake yourself useful?

27:56.241 --> 27:57.742
Yeah. What do you need?

27:57.742 --> 27:59.244
Well, just feed this o
ver to this fellow here.

27:59.244 --> 28:01.246
so. Stick it under the bumper when I say

28:01.246 --> 28:02.247
ift Then I'll give her a l

28:02.247 --> 28:03.248
and we'll be on our way.

28:03.248 --> 28:04.249
Yeah, all right.

28:09.754 --> 28:11.756
Where the heck did they get this yo-yo?

28:11.756 --> 28:13.758
s. Aw, who know

28:16.261 --> 28:17.762
Okay, it's under the bumper.

28:17.762 --> 28:19.764
All right.

28:19.764 --> 28:22.267
Why don't you stand clear
now and I'll lift her up.

28:23.268 --> 28:24.769
Okay, come o n.

28:24.769 --> 28:25.770
Let's go.

28:36.781 --> 28:39.284
Man, I can't believe this, can you?

28:39.284 --> 28:41.786
Okay. That ought to do it.

28:44.289 --> 28:45.290
BOTH: Hey!

28:45.290 --> 28:46.291
Hey, wait a minute. Stop!

28:46.291 --> 28:48.793
LARSON: What's going on here?!

28:48.793 --> 28:50.795
What are you doing?! Oh, my God!

28:51.296 --> 28:52.297
(car horn blaring)

28:52.297 --> 28:53.298
op! Hey, Hey! Stop! St

28:53.798 --> 28:55.800
ls. Hold up! Federal marsha

28:56.301 --> 28:57.302
We're taking o ver this vehicle.

28:57.302 --> 28:58.303
. Come on. Get out of it

28:58.803 --> 29:00.305
Let's go!

29:00.305 --> 29:01.806
(engine revs, tires squeal)

29:05.310 --> 29:06.811
I just know you're gonna tell me

29:06.811 --> 29:08.313
what this is all about.

29:08.313 --> 29:10.315
s Well, right now, I'm giving the Fed

29:10.315 --> 29:12.817
a deeper and more profound
understanding of themselves.

29:13.318 --> 29:14.319
an? You know what I me

29:14.319 --> 29:18.823
(tires squealing)

29:25.330 --> 29:26.831
Dumb trick.

29:26.831 --> 29:28.833
He can't outrun us in that thing.

29:53.358 --> 29:54.859
That ought to sl ow 'em down a bit.

29:56.861 --> 29:59.864
b? What was that you said about dum

30:06.871 --> 30:07.872
om. This is her ro

30:07.872 --> 30:08.873
e. I'll wait outsid

30:11.876 --> 30:13.378
er. FRANK: MacGyv

30:13.378 --> 30:14.879
Too late.

30:14.879 --> 30:15.880
e. Excuse m

30:15.880 --> 30:17.882
The patient that
was in here--

30:17.882 --> 30:19.884
? when did she pass away

30:19.884 --> 30:21.886
Oh, she didn't.

30:21.886 --> 30:22.887
No, not at all.

30:22.887 --> 30:23.888
It-it was the family's decision

30:24.389 --> 30:25.890
she would be much more comfortable...

30:25.890 --> 30:26.891
At home.

30:26.891 --> 30:29.894
Her son had her discharged.

30:29.894 --> 30:31.396
She's still alive.

30:31.396 --> 30:33.398
. She's with Joey, you know

30:33.398 --> 30:35.400
It's his way of gettin
g you to go to him.

30:35.400 --> 30:36.401
It's a trap.

30:36.401 --> 30:37.902
I've got to see her, MacGyver.

30:42.774 --> 30:44.776
FRANK: That's the house
I grew up in, MacGyver.

30:44.776 --> 30:45.777
It's a fortress.

30:47.779 --> 30:49.781
That's Mama's room.

30:49.781 --> 30:52.283
Is that you, my son?

30:52.283 --> 30:54.285
y. Everything's going to be oka

30:54.285 --> 30:56.287
I'm so glad you're here.

30:56.287 --> 30:57.288
Me, too, Mama.

30:57.288 --> 31:00.291
And I'll take ca re of everything.

31:00.291 --> 31:02.293
Where's, uh...?

31:10.802 --> 31:12.303
I love you, Mama.

31:15.807 --> 31:18.309
I love you, too, Frank.

31:18.309 --> 31:20.311
Frank?

31:20.311 --> 31:22.313
No, Mama, it's me.

31:22.313 --> 31:23.314
It's Joey, Mama.

31:27.819 --> 31:28.820
It's Joey.

31:50.341 --> 31:51.342
I am....

31:51.342 --> 31:53.845
United States Marshal Andrew T. Wiley.

31:53.845 --> 31:55.346
I've been waiting for you.

31:55.346 --> 31:58.349
I'm Vincent Ivory,
Mr. Bennet's attorney.

31:58.349 --> 31:59.851
I know. I was expectin g you'd be here.

31:59.851 --> 32:00.852
et. We're looking for Frank Benn

32:01.352 --> 32:03.354
He isn't here.

32:03.354 --> 32:04.856
Well, I have to se e that for myself.

32:04.856 --> 32:06.357
A warrant is on the way.

32:06.357 --> 32:07.859
I'm afraid not, Marshal.

32:07.859 --> 32:12.864
You see, Judge Nielsen
turned down your request.

32:12.864 --> 32:16.367
It pays to have friends in high places.

32:22.373 --> 32:23.374
We sit.

32:23.374 --> 32:24.876
Anything comes in or
out, we stop and check.

32:25.376 --> 32:26.377
Right.

32:48.900 --> 32:50.902
I don't get it.

32:50.902 --> 32:52.403
Fence juice is off,

32:52.904 --> 32:53.905
camera's shut down...

32:54.405 --> 32:56.908
This place is usually triple
- rigged with security systems.

32:57.408 --> 32:58.409
t Well, he's got the welcome ma

32:58.409 --> 32:59.911
. out for you, Frank

33:00.411 --> 33:01.913
He wants you inside.

33:01.913 --> 33:03.915
That's the first thing we've agreed on

33:03.915 --> 33:04.916
in a long time.

33:05.416 --> 33:06.417
Okay.

33:06.417 --> 33:07.418
Hey, listen.

33:07.919 --> 33:09.420
You can still change
your mind, you know.

33:09.420 --> 33:11.422
No.

33:11.923 --> 33:13.424
t. All righ

33:13.424 --> 33:15.426
Give me the signal when
you're ready to leave.

33:15.426 --> 33:16.427
FRANK: I'll just walk out.

33:16.427 --> 33:17.428
Joey's not gonna try anything

33:17.929 --> 33:20.431
with the whole Federal
Strike Force out there.

33:20.431 --> 33:23.935
Kind of handy having them out
there looking for me, isn't it?

33:23.935 --> 33:28.439
, Frank, the Feds do
n't know you're inside

33:28.439 --> 33:31.442
. and they won't know
until we're ready to leave

33:31.442 --> 33:33.444
l, So you give me the signa

33:33.444 --> 33:35.947
? then I tip off Wiley's tro
ops and we stroll on out, okay

33:35.947 --> 33:37.448
Okay.

33:37.448 --> 33:38.950
Wish me luck.

33:38.950 --> 33:40.952
.. Hey, listen.

33:40.952 --> 33:43.454
u? give your mother
a kiss for me, will yo

33:57.468 --> 33:58.469
Hey, Frank.

33:58.970 --> 33:59.971
How you doing?

33:59.971 --> 34:01.973
u. We've been expecting yo

34:01.973 --> 34:04.475
There's someone inside
been waiting to see you.

34:08.478 --> 34:09.480
Hello, Frank.

34:09.480 --> 34:10.982
-
- Glad you're here

34:10.982 --> 34:11.983
for Mama's sake.

34:12.483 --> 34:13.484
Where's your buddy?

34:13.484 --> 34:14.985
Who?

34:14.985 --> 34:16.487
(mocking): Who?

34:16.487 --> 34:17.487
. Doesn't matter

34:17.487 --> 34:19.489
ou. What's important
i s Mama gets to see y

34:19.489 --> 34:21.492
. She doesn't have much time

34:21.492 --> 34:23.995
VINCENT: Frank.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.496
So?

34:25.996 --> 34:27.498
This is nice of you, Joey.

34:27.498 --> 34:29.000
Papa would approve.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.001
d. Yes, he woul

34:30.501 --> 34:33.004
That always was important
to you, wasn't it?

34:44.514 --> 34:47.018
LARSON: Wiley--
got a call.

34:47.018 --> 34:49.020
He's on his way now.

34:54.525 --> 34:56.027
Marshal Wiley.

34:56.027 --> 34:57.528
OPERATOR: We're patching a call through.

34:57.528 --> 34:59.030
One moment.

34:59.030 --> 35:01.032
JOEY (imitating Frank):
Wiley-- Frank Bennet.

35:01.032 --> 35:02.533
Where the hell are you?

35:02.533 --> 35:04.035
I'm at MacGyver's apartment.

35:04.035 --> 35:06.037
You realize I've been
looking all over for you?

35:06.037 --> 35:07.538
JOEY: I want to see my mother.

35:07.538 --> 35:09.040
Now we both see it's no use.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.042
Joey's people are all over the place.

35:11.542 --> 35:12.543
She's not in the hospital.

35:13.044 --> 35:14.045
I need protection, Wiley.

35:14.045 --> 35:16.547
Are you sure Joey's
soldiers are there, Frank?

35:18.049 --> 35:19.550
Marshal, do you remember

35:19.550 --> 35:22.053
what you told me the
first time you phoned me?

35:22.053 --> 35:23.554
"We can take care of you, Frank.

35:23.554 --> 35:26.057
Another life, another
chance, if you help us."

35:26.057 --> 35:27.558
Okay. Stay right where you are.

35:27.558 --> 35:29.060
I'm on my way. 10-four.

35:29.060 --> 35:30.561
He's at MacGyver's. Let's move it.

35:30.561 --> 35:35.066
You know, you were right,
Vincent, about Frank and me.

35:35.066 --> 35:39.570
Face, walk,
voice-- all alike.

35:42.573 --> 35:44.575
I'll miss him.

35:55.086 --> 35:57.088
(dogs barking)

36:02.593 --> 36:06.097
(barking)

36:09.600 --> 36:11.602
KATERINA: Frankie...

36:11.602 --> 36:13.104
is that you?

36:13.104 --> 36:16.107
Are-Are you really there?

36:21.112 --> 36:24.115
. Yes, Mama, I'm really here

36:24.115 --> 36:27.618
Remember, when you were a little boy,

36:27.618 --> 36:31.622
you took my hand and we
walked down the street.

36:31.622 --> 36:35.626
You always said, "Watch over me, Mama.

36:35.626 --> 36:40.131
When I grow up, I'll keep you safe."

36:40.131 --> 36:43.634
I remember.

36:43.634 --> 36:48.139
Frank, it's my time.

36:50.141 --> 36:52.143
I'm ready.

36:52.143 --> 36:53.644
I'm only sorry that I won't see

36:53.644 --> 36:56.147
the children you will have.

36:56.147 --> 36:58.649
Mama...

36:58.649 --> 37:03.154
It's good to hold your hand... again.

37:03.154 --> 37:06.157
(moans quietly)

37:24.675 --> 37:27.678
It's okay.

37:27.678 --> 37:29.680
Sleep.

37:50.701 --> 37:51.702
Oh, God.

37:51.702 --> 37:53.704
Wiley and the Feds are gone.

38:06.217 --> 38:09.720
MacGYVER: There's the signal.

38:09.720 --> 38:12.723
Now all I have to do is spring Frank...

38:13.224 --> 38:16.227
before his brother murders him.

38:30.241 --> 38:33.744
(barking)

38:51.762 --> 38:54.765
(barking)

39:04.275 --> 39:05.776
Good dogs.

39:05.776 --> 39:09.780
(barking)

39:24.795 --> 39:25.796
Mama's dead.

39:30.301 --> 39:32.803
I'm gonna miss her, Frank.

39:32.803 --> 39:34.805
I'm gonna miss you, too.

40:12.843 --> 40:14.345
JOEY: In the kitchen, I think.

40:14.345 --> 40:15.846
? What do you say, Frank

40:16.347 --> 40:17.848
) (chuckling

40:28.859 --> 40:32.863
(yelling)

40:34.365 --> 40:36.367
Wiley's gone! I know!

40:36.367 --> 40:38.869
Tommy!

40:38.869 --> 40:39.870
(gunshot)

40:41.872 --> 40:42.373
Back stairs.

40:42.873 --> 40:43.374
Right!

40:45.376 --> 40:47.378
Attic. Right.

41:07.398 --> 41:09.400
(grunting)

41:09.400 --> 41:10.401
They got something behind it.

41:10.401 --> 41:11.902
Tommy, give it a burst!

41:28.919 --> 41:30.421
Get another clip!

41:32.423 --> 41:33.924
What if they try and get out the window?

41:33.924 --> 41:37.928
If the fall doesn't
kill them, the dogs will.

41:42.933 --> 41:44.435
MacGYVER: This problem's kind of tricky.

41:44.435 --> 41:46.437
No place to go,

41:46.437 --> 41:47.938
and no way to get there.

41:50.441 --> 41:53.944
s. Frank, what we need is wing

41:53.944 --> 41:55.946
Cleaning fluid, that's a start.

41:58.449 --> 42:00.451
Now, something to go with it.

42:15.966 --> 42:19.470
Ah, camphor balls... now we're cooking.

42:36.487 --> 42:36.987
MacGyver.

42:37.488 --> 42:38.989
te. Give me a minu

42:39.490 --> 42:41.492
Sure, take all the time you need.

42:45.496 --> 42:47.498
A pulley. Right.

42:54.505 --> 42:57.508
s. Frank, I thi nk we're in busines

43:04.014 --> 43:05.516
Nothing! Nobody there.

43:05.516 --> 43:06.517
No sign of a struggle.

43:06.517 --> 43:08.018
Neighbors didn't see anything.

43:08.018 --> 43:10.020
We got suckered.

43:10.020 --> 43:11.522
They're at the Bennet house.

43:11.522 --> 43:12.523
Let's go!

43:12.523 --> 43:13.524
They got to be.

43:23.534 --> 43:26.036
(grunting)

43:26.036 --> 43:28.038
Watch out, Max!

43:39.049 --> 43:41.552
MacGYVER: Now, I don't
know if anybody ever tried

43:41.552 --> 43:43.554
a rocket-powered harpoon before,

43:43.554 --> 43:46.557
so I figure it's about a 50-50 chance

43:46.557 --> 43:50.060
it'll fire off or blow up.

43:58.068 --> 43:59.570
I hate to rush you, MacGyver...

44:00.070 --> 44:02.072
I'm getting there.

44:17.588 --> 44:19.590
ay. They've got more
hea vy stuff in the w

44:19.590 --> 44:21.592
The bench! There's a
bench! Get the bench!

44:28.599 --> 44:31.101
All right, hold it
steady for me, will you?

44:38.108 --> 44:39.610
Come on! Come on!

44:50.621 --> 44:52.122
MacGYVER: Hold on.

45:10.641 --> 45:12.142
Lean into it!

45:12.142 --> 45:13.644
Okay.

45:19.650 --> 45:20.651
Go.

45:30.160 --> 45:33.664
(barking)

45:51.682 --> 45:52.683
All right.

45:54.685 --> 45:56.186
. We got i t. One last shove

45:59.690 --> 46:02.192
(barking)

46:13.203 --> 46:14.204
You all right?

46:14.705 --> 46:15.706
Yeah.

46:17.708 --> 46:18.709
(sirens approaching)

46:21.211 --> 46:22.713
ey. That'll be Wil

46:23.213 --> 46:26.216
This time, he won't need
a warrant to get Joey.

46:26.216 --> 46:27.718
(sighs)

46:27.718 --> 46:29.219
Pretty slick, Frankie.

46:32.723 --> 46:35.726
Even Papa would be proud.

46:36.226 --> 46:37.728
Well, it's over.

46:37.728 --> 46:39.730
Yeah, it is.

46:39.730 --> 46:42.733
I guess I mean for Joey.

46:44.735 --> 46:46.236
Regrets?

46:46.236 --> 46:52.242
Some, but, uh, that's
how it's got to end.
