I invited Dragon Lord
Ember to Ponyville today.

00:36.603 --> 00:39.204
Reason two, the Dragon
Lord is a dragon.

Reason three: she's coming here

00:42.176 --> 00:43.541

trying to be friends,

more and more fights.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.266
You will, but first how
about we grab a bite to eat?

10:35.335 --> 10:38.803
You know, now that you've said
it, I am a little hungry.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.204
Is there a dining
room in the castle?

10:40.273 --> 10:42.273
NO!

10:42.342 --> 10:46.077
... I mean yeah, but
that's castle food.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.246
If you want the good
stuff, we gotta go to town.

10:51.251 --> 10:53.117
[phew]

10:53.186 --> 10:55.052
... and that's why you should
never let cupcake flavors

10:55.121 --> 10:57.221
get in the way of
your friendship.

10:57.290 --> 11:00.825
I guess I never thought of it
that way. Thanks, Spike.

11:03.429 --> 11:05.296
Oh, come on! Glow!

11:05.365 --> 11:06.731
Spike!

11:06.800 --> 11:08.232
There you are!

11:08.301 --> 11:10.301
Done with your boring
paper work I see.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.437
Ha ha ha!

11:13.506 --> 11:18.075
Yup, I am done with whatever
Starlight says I was doing...

11:18.144 --> 11:20.377
Thorax wanted to get
out of the castle.

11:20.446 --> 11:24.215
I thought coming to town was
a really, really great idea.

11:24.284 --> 11:26.451
Well! Maybe now we can talk.

11:27.954 --> 11:30.087
Sure.

11:30.156 --> 11:31.455
I'll leave you guys to it.

11:31.524 --> 11:35.059
First of all, I want to say
thank you for having me over.

11:35.128 --> 11:36.961
I'm in a bit of a
leadership pickle

11:37.030 --> 11:38.563
and I could use
some advice.

11:38.632 --> 11:43.300
Well, I definitely want to help
you out as quickly as possible.

11:43.369 --> 11:46.303
Here's my problem: there's this
renegade group of changelings

11:46.372 --> 11:48.305
who still feed off of love.

11:48.374 --> 11:51.876
Even though I said, "Hey, let's
not do that anymore," they say,

11:51.945 --> 11:53.878
"Hey this is how we've
been doing things

11:53.947 --> 11:55.479
for hundreds of years."

11:55.548 --> 11:57.348
but it's like they don't
want to even though

11:57.417 --> 11:58.817
I'm the leader and I
asked politely...

12:02.422 --> 12:07.558
[interested chatter]

12:07.627 --> 12:09.093
Hello.

12:09.162 --> 12:12.797
I am Ember, daughter of Torch,
winner of the Gauntlet of Fire

12:12.866 --> 12:14.799
and lord of all dragons!

12:14.868 --> 12:16.200
[whoosh]

12:16.269 --> 12:19.370
[screams]

12:19.439 --> 12:22.273
Usually when I do that, the
dragons are eager to meet me.

12:22.342 --> 12:25.075
That's not how
ponies make friends.

12:25.144 --> 12:27.479
Ahh, I get it.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.917
This is a weird friendship
thing you ponies do, right?

12:32.986 --> 12:34.486
[splat]

12:40.293 --> 12:42.993
Uh... you guys
are in town, too?

12:43.062 --> 12:44.361
What are you
talking about?

12:44.430 --> 12:46.163
You've been with
me this whole time.

12:46.232 --> 12:47.999
No, I'm Starlight.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.403
Riiiiight.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.438
I'm sorry, but you
can't blame me.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.507
You both look and
act so much alike.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.509
What?

12:58.578 --> 13:01.946
And they said to me just
keep saying the same thing.

13:02.015 --> 13:05.115
You know I think my leadership
problems started in childhood.

13:05.184 --> 13:07.384
I must've been three when ...
Three's a different story --

13:07.453 --> 13:08.786
and you definitely
gotta hear it,

13:08.854 --> 13:11.989
but the story about my
brother was when I was two...

13:12.058 --> 13:13.257
Or was I one?

13:13.326 --> 13:14.325
This is my seat!

13:14.394 --> 13:15.526
I saw it first.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.262
Well, I got here first.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.365
Thorax, excuse me for a second.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.403
Ponies, please.

13:25.471 --> 13:29.474
If I may, I think I can help
solve this friendship problem.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.611
You two should sit together.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.646
You both like the same place;
you both ordered muffins;

13:35.715 --> 13:36.714
you're both ponies.

13:36.783 --> 13:38.515
I think if you made
a little effort,

13:38.584 --> 13:40.185
you'd find that you
have a .... whoa!

13:41.955 --> 13:43.454
OK, that had to have done it.

13:43.523 --> 13:45.056
Come on spikes, glow.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.461
Hey, that was
really great advice.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.363
So what do you
think I should do?

13:54.734 --> 13:56.166
[gasp]

13:56.235 --> 13:58.602
Actually, I uh need a minute.

13:58.671 --> 14:02.273
Alone. To really come
up with great advice.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.607
I'll be right back!

14:03.676 --> 14:05.910
Great. No problem.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.511
Leave me again...

14:07.580 --> 14:09.680
It's fine.

14:09.749 --> 14:15.052
I'm just saying, you're both
purple ponies with purple hair.

14:15.121 --> 14:18.622
You both have cutie marks
with sparkle-y things.

14:18.691 --> 14:21.592
Mine's more of
a glimmer!

14:21.661 --> 14:23.928
How is that different?

14:23.997 --> 14:25.663
Oh, good, Spike.

14:25.732 --> 14:28.098
Can you please tell
these two I'm right?

14:28.167 --> 14:30.200
They look very similar.

14:30.269 --> 14:33.637
Well, you know, one thing
friends do is let something go

14:33.706 --> 14:36.006
when it's upsetting
somepony else.

14:36.075 --> 14:37.441
But I'm right.

14:37.510 --> 14:40.377
Besides, who are you to be
telling me about friendship?

14:40.446 --> 14:42.947
I've barely seen
you all day!

14:43.016 --> 14:45.416
I've seen you...

14:45.485 --> 14:47.218
Are you calling me a liar?

14:49.088 --> 14:51.222
Hey! No one yells
at my friend!

14:52.425 --> 14:53.992
[roar]

14:56.362 --> 14:57.962
[crash]

14:58.031 --> 15:00.130
Spike, get away from the bear!

15:00.199 --> 15:03.334
Actually the bear's a changeling
and he's quite gentle.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.969
Not anymore!

15:05.038 --> 15:06.371
[roar]

15:07.673 --> 15:09.307

15:29.529 --> 15:31.462

15:31.531 --> 15:35.032
You back away! I'm not

15:35.101 --> 15:38.135
Wait, did you say you're not
going to let me harm Spike?

15:38.204 --> 15:39.470
Yeah!

15:39.539 --> 15:40.771
But that's what I'm doing.

15:40.840 --> 15:42.606
What?

15:42.675 --> 15:45.442
Yeah, what?

15:45.511 --> 15:47.578
Equestria as we know it is over!

15:47.647 --> 15:49.179
The war that pits
changeling against dragon

15:49.248 --> 15:50.547
is about to begin!

15:50.616 --> 15:51.949
And it's all my fault!

15:52.017 --> 15:55.319
My title of Equestria's
Friendship Ambassador is a lie--

15:55.388 --> 15:58.088
Oh. Hey. You guys
aren't fighting?

15:58.157 --> 16:00.024
Why would we be fighting?

16:00.093 --> 16:02.026
Because I accidentally
invited you both

16:02.095 --> 16:04.795
over to Ponyville
on the same day?

16:04.864 --> 16:07.064
Both: So what?

16:07.133 --> 16:10.067
So, I was trying
to keep you apart,

16:10.136 --> 16:12.203
because I didn't
think you'd get along.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.773
Oh, I get it.

16:15.842 --> 16:18.375
You thought he wouldn't like me
just because I'm a dragon

16:18.444 --> 16:20.477
and I'm bad at friendship?

16:20.546 --> 16:23.080
No! No! Of course not! But...

16:23.149 --> 16:25.816
Wait, isn't that
why you're here?

16:25.885 --> 16:29.586
I can say I'm bad at friendship;
you can't say it about me!

16:29.655 --> 16:31.722
You know what? I don't
want to talk about it.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.724
Wait, please...

16:33.793 --> 16:36.393
[sigh] I'm sorry.

16:36.462 --> 16:38.228
No, no. It's cool.

16:38.297 --> 16:40.564
You thought I'd be too soft
and someone like Ember

16:40.633 --> 16:43.834
would never respect me, just
like my own changelings.

16:43.903 --> 16:45.302
No, that's not it!

16:45.371 --> 16:47.171
Thorax! Wait!

16:47.240 --> 16:48.806
Oh, no.

16:48.875 --> 16:50.375
What have I done?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.044
[splash]

16:59.352 --> 17:01.418
Why are you still here?

17:01.487 --> 17:05.522
[sigh] Because I'm having
trouble leading my pack.

17:05.591 --> 17:08.192
So I don't really
want to go home.

17:08.261 --> 17:10.627
Wait, you're in charge?

17:10.696 --> 17:13.864
Ho boy, you need to
be more assertive.

17:13.933 --> 17:17.301
That's my problem,
I don't know how.

17:17.370 --> 17:20.437
I tried asking them to please
follow my directions

17:20.506 --> 17:22.172
and I even offered
a prize and--

17:22.241 --> 17:24.175
SHH! Stop talking.

17:25.912 --> 17:27.711
That's how you do it.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.547
Whoa. That just
gave me chills.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.182
I know you have
it in you.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.751
You turned into a
bear to defend Spike.

17:34.820 --> 17:37.521
I guess I can be tough when
I'm defending my friends.

17:37.590 --> 17:42.426
But when I'm just enforcing my
rules, I feel unsure of myself.

17:42.495 --> 17:44.428
There's nothing to
be unsure of.

17:44.497 --> 17:46.530
You're the leader
for a reason.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.465
Make a decision and
let it be known

17:48.534 --> 17:50.501
that the decision is final.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.703
And if that doesn't
work, turn into a bear.

17:52.772 --> 17:54.238
[chuckle]

17:54.307 --> 17:55.572
That's good advice.

17:55.641 --> 17:57.241
I know it is.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.143
So what's your deal?

17:59.212 --> 18:01.145
Why do you think you're
so bad at friendship?

18:01.214 --> 18:02.779
I don't want to
talk about it.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.515
Oh, you have to.

18:04.584 --> 18:06.284
How else are you gonna
solve  your problems?

18:08.821 --> 18:11.455
Through feats of strength
and fire duels, of course.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.223
Hiyah!

18:13.292 --> 18:15.359
[whoosh]

18:15.428 --> 18:17.361
[explosion]

18:17.430 --> 18:19.463
Uh,...how did that help?

18:19.532 --> 18:21.398
Crushing another
dragon in competition

18:21.467 --> 18:25.235
establishes my dominance
and makes me feel great!

18:25.304 --> 18:27.938
Right, but how do
you think they feel?

18:28.007 --> 18:29.806
Humiliated! Ashamed!

18:29.875 --> 18:32.176
They probably want to run
away and bury themselves

18:32.245 --> 18:33.710
under a rock and...

18:33.779 --> 18:35.379
... never come out.

18:35.448 --> 18:37.247
They're probably sad.

18:37.316 --> 18:38.549
Kinda low.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.551
Definitely not happy.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.654
That's because that kind of
competition can divide you.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.856
And it doesn't get to
the heart of the issue.

18:45.925 --> 18:48.926
Talking about your
feelings does.

18:48.995 --> 18:49.960
Achoo!

18:50.029 --> 18:51.762
[whoosh]

18:51.831 --> 18:53.830
I think I'm allergic
to feelings.

18:53.899 --> 18:57.768
You know you don't have to  be
sappy or huggy-feely about it,

18:57.837 --> 19:00.971
but you should let your
friends know how you feel.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.907
I know where
we can start.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.209
Where?

19:05.278 --> 19:07.311
Oh. Spike.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.312
I got there.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.683
I think they're gone.

19:12.752 --> 19:14.585
They probably never
want to see me again.

19:14.654 --> 19:15.586
[thud]

19:15.655 --> 19:17.754
Or ... they want
to see you now.

19:17.823 --> 19:19.223
[gulp]

19:19.292 --> 19:20.991
Guess what, Spike?

19:21.060 --> 19:22.960
I know. I'm so sorry--

19:23.029 --> 19:25.229
LET ME TALK ABOUT THIS!

19:25.298 --> 19:27.365

19:30.536 --> 19:31.468
[sigh]

19:31.537 --> 19:34.538
OK, that's a good
first attempt.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.841
Now maybe try to
be more specific.

19:41.347 --> 19:42.379
I'm...

19:42.448 --> 19:43.480
uhm...

19:43.549 --> 19:44.915

19:44.984 --> 19:46.416
You have every right to be.

19:46.485 --> 19:48.418
I KNOW I DO.

19:48.487 --> 19:50.721
And I know I need to
tell you how I feel

19:50.790 --> 19:54.491
because my friend, Thorax said
it would make me feel better.

19:54.560 --> 19:55.959
AND IT DOES!

19:56.028 --> 19:58.362
Yeah! And I have no
problem telling you

19:58.431 --> 19:59.596
what you did
was wrong

19:59.665 --> 20:01.398
because my
friend Ember

more assertive.

I didn't even think about
how it could go right.

Can you forgive me?

20:18.884 --> 20:20.751

feel better.

Yeah, but then I solved
it by learning my lesson.

20:45.444 --> 20:46.810
I should have told
my two friends

20:46.879 --> 20:48.612
about each other immediately,

20:48.681 --> 20:50.647
instead of assuming
they wouldn't get along.

20:50.716 --> 20:52.449
Good job, Spike.

20:52.518 --> 20:54.651
Is this another part
of pony friendship?

20:54.720 --> 20:56.720
Telling each other what
you learned all the time?

20:56.789 --> 20:58.355
[giggle]

20:58.424 --> 20:59.389
Yeah, pretty much!

20:59.458 --> 21:00.757
Yep!

21:00.826 --> 21:02.959
[happy chatter]

21:03.028 --> 21:05.629
Spike: So! As a
show of unity,

21:05.698 --> 21:08.098
I present the Dragon Fire
Flame of Friendship

21:08.167 --> 21:09.800
to both Dragon Lord Ember

21:09.869 --> 21:12.769
and Thorax, Leader of
the Changeling Pack.

21:12.838 --> 21:16.039
May the Flame of Friendship
burn for eternity.

21:16.108 --> 21:20.644
[cheering]

21:20.713 --> 21:21.678
Achoo!

21:21.747 --> 21:23.413
[whoosh]

21:23.482 --> 21:24.749
[gasps all around]

21:26.485 --> 21:29.686
You should have more
things made of rocks.

21:29.755 --> 21:31.656
[laughter]
