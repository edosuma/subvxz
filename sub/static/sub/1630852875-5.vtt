00:04.352 --> 00:05.918
I'm gonna invite everyone
down to our shore house.

00:05.962 --> 00:07.659
I feel like I want to throw
a little pink party,

00:07.703 --> 00:09.444
opposed to a white party.
- Oh, cute.

00:09.487 --> 00:11.054
Teresa rented a shore house,

00:11.098 --> 00:12.664
so she'll be down there
with Louie.

00:12.708 --> 00:15.493
Switch of plans--
I'm staying at Jen's house

00:15.537 --> 00:17.626
because I have
a full house of children.

00:17.669 --> 00:19.584
So we're going to have
the barbecue tonight

00:19.628 --> 00:21.325

00:21.369 --> 00:23.414
I want to like Louie,
but sh-- came out again today.

00:23.458 --> 00:24.589
- You're kidding.
- Again?

00:24.633 --> 00:26.200
I mean,
this stuff keeps leaking.

00:26.243 --> 00:28.289
And let's not forget
that weird video, right?

00:28.332 --> 00:30.378
- Tre, where's Louie?
- He's driving down.

00:30.421 --> 00:32.336
Louie, where are you?
We're waiting for you.

00:32.380 --> 00:33.903
Where was Louie today?

00:33.946 --> 00:35.557
Maybe he doesn't want to deal
with all of us together.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.516
Why?

00:38.560 --> 00:41.128
Teresa just texts me--"Make
sure you back up my boyfriend."

00:41.171 --> 00:42.520
You know what that means?

00:42.564 --> 00:44.174
She's gonna have
a ----ing freak out.

00:44.218 --> 00:46.263
What happened with Louie?

00:50.398 --> 00:52.487
I told him not to come around
if he feels like that.

00:54.141 --> 00:55.577
I don't want to discuss it.

00:55.620 --> 00:58.493

08:36.037 --> 08:38.126
Like, I don't trust Margaret
at all.

08:38.169 --> 08:39.127
She's ruthless.

08:39.170 --> 08:40.607
She's avoided
the conversation

08:40.650 --> 08:41.999
for five or six weeks.

08:42.043 --> 08:43.392
<i>- At Jeffrey's house.</i> <i>
- Yeah.</i>

08:43.435 --> 08:46.700
<i>But I want to go back</i> <i>
and handle the situation</i>

08:46.743 --> 08:48.658
because no one should judge anybody,

08:48.702 --> 08:50.007
<i>especially on their past.</i>

08:50.051 --> 08:51.922
When that happens,
that's when I step in.

08:51.966 --> 08:55.099
At the end of the day, is
there a weirder sh-- out there?

08:55.143 --> 08:57.885
<i>For sure. But guess what.</i> <i>
We've all dealt with it.</i>

08:57.928 --> 08:59.626
<i>Let him handle it.</i> <i>
He's a grown man.</i>

08:59.669 --> 09:00.975
He wants to be with her.

09:01.018 --> 09:04.544
This is what it goes
with the territory.

09:04.587 --> 09:05.806
- Hi, guys.
- Hey.

09:05.849 --> 09:07.895
- Hey-hey!
- Hi.

09:07.938 --> 09:09.853
- Hey, guys.
- Sorry. Hi.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.986
- Hi.
- I brought tequila.

09:12.029 --> 09:13.683
I mean, this is so Teresa.

09:13.727 --> 09:15.729
- You look beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

09:15.772 --> 09:17.905
Hi, Louie.
Been waiting for you all day.

09:17.948 --> 09:19.384
<i>She leaves in a huff</i>

09:19.428 --> 09:21.299
and then comes back
like nothing ever happened.

09:21.343 --> 09:22.300
What are you drinking?

09:22.344 --> 09:23.563
- I'll have tequila.
- Tequila?

09:23.606 --> 09:24.564
Yeah, it's tequila
and pineapple.

09:24.607 --> 09:25.608
On the rocks.

09:25.652 --> 09:26.870
Louie, we were
at the beach, man.

09:26.914 --> 09:28.568
I wish you would have came.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

09:28.611 --> 09:30.221
Joe was wishing you had come

09:30.265 --> 09:31.788
'cause you'd be the only person
with skinnier legs than him.

09:31.832 --> 09:34.051
He don't stop, Frankie.

09:34.095 --> 09:36.053
Louie, what'd play
in high school, like--

09:36.097 --> 09:37.359
I played...

09:37.402 --> 09:39.056
- What was your sport?
- Played with himself.

09:39.100 --> 09:40.928
I played a lot with myself. Yeah.

09:40.971 --> 09:43.060
Frank's on a roll today,
son of a bitch.

09:43.104 --> 09:45.410
All day.
You can laugh and go all day.

09:46.716 --> 09:48.762
- Now I'm full. That was good.
- Yeah.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.112
- That was so good.
- I'm happy.

09:55.377 --> 09:56.857
This is very awkward.

10:00.077 --> 10:02.340
Huh?

10:02.384 --> 10:04.168
Which one is that?

10:06.606 --> 10:08.085
I don't know--
Jennifer said that,

10:08.129 --> 10:10.000
but it doesn't seem that way.
- No.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.481
What? Jennifer said what?

10:12.524 --> 10:15.049
No, I'm saying...

10:15.092 --> 10:16.267
Say it.

10:16.311 --> 10:17.921
- Nothing.
- Say it.

10:17.965 --> 10:19.662
Good?

10:19.706 --> 10:22.186
Teresa, Jennifer said
you left in a fit.

10:25.146 --> 10:27.452

I'm serious.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.158
No, I didn't--

You said that you were
very upset, and you were like,

"I'm not coming back,"

10:41.336 --> 10:44.426
- No, I didn't say that.
- No, Tere--

10:44.469 --> 10:47.124
Is there anything
that anybody has to say to me?

10:47.168 --> 10:49.170

It's not a nosy thing.

I've been with him a year.

- Please, please, please.
- I didn't ask a question.

Please, please.

Somebody goes after him,
they're going after me.

- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- No, one's going after him.

I mean...

13:14.315 --> 13:15.838
<i>I mean, wait a minute.</i>

13:15.882 --> 13:17.709
Does Louie really think
I'm trying to intimidate him?

13:17.753 --> 13:19.276
Whatever you want to say,
talk to me.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.017
I'm trying to help you
explain yourself,

13:21.061 --> 13:23.454
'cause everybody here
thinks that video is crazy.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.413
- He does not owe anybody...
- Teresa, Teresa.

13:25.456 --> 13:26.762
- An explanation.
- Oh, my God.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.069
- Teresa, I'm gonna leave.
- All right, say--

13:29.112 --> 13:30.418
I'm really gonna leave
'cause she won't learn

13:30.461 --> 13:31.723
if I don't leave, right?

13:31.767 --> 13:33.029
You got to stop.
You got to be quiet.

13:33.073 --> 13:34.857
- Don't leave.
- But you have to be quiet

13:34.901 --> 13:36.772
'cause I'm really
getting annoyed.

13:36.816 --> 13:38.513
I want to talk, and I can't
'cause you keep cutting me off.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.254
Like, that's not--
- I want to hear Louie talk.

13:40.297 --> 13:42.778
Two ears, one mouth.
Listen more.

13:42.822 --> 13:43.866
Like, nothing intimidates me,

13:43.910 --> 13:45.346
so what do you want
to say to me?

13:45.389 --> 13:47.043
Nothing.

13:47.087 --> 13:49.089
I was saying the video had
come out all over the Internet.

13:49.132 --> 13:50.699
Unfortunately, people were
saying negative things.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.527
Every single person here
was like,

13:52.570 --> 13:54.921
"What kind of place
is this special camp?"

13:54.964 --> 13:56.313
Listen, here it is.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.359
I became a very good example
in business, right?

13:58.402 --> 14:00.013
No, very successful.
We all say it.

14:00.056 --> 14:02.493
I can speak for myself.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.887
So I grew up with a lot
of trauma in my life,

14:04.931 --> 14:06.889
and, you know,
a friend of mine went out

14:06.933 --> 14:08.935
and started this thing called
Warrior out in California,

14:08.978 --> 14:12.286
and a lot of men go revisit
their pain to see their pain,

14:12.329 --> 14:13.809
get clarity,
certainty there in life,

14:13.853 --> 14:15.376
and I was in a relationship
with a woman,

14:15.419 --> 14:16.812
so I had to learn
in that moment

14:16.856 --> 14:18.683
basically how to be vulnerable
to that woman

14:18.727 --> 14:20.685
and tell them, "Listen,
I'm sorry for not, like"--

14:20.729 --> 14:22.644
'Cause I didn't want to commit
to a marriage.

14:22.687 --> 14:25.125
I didn't want to commit
to a bad woman, you know?

14:25.168 --> 14:28.128
So I went and apologized
to a woman for not being,

14:28.171 --> 14:30.826
like, honest and saying,
"You know what? It's over."

14:30.870 --> 14:32.784
<i>Are we watching</i> <i>
the same video?</i>

14:32.828 --> 14:36.484
The video that I saw had you
asking this woman to marry you.

14:36.527 --> 14:37.833
So that's why I did that.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.530
And that's where
that video came from.

14:39.574 --> 14:40.967
Does that make any sense
to you?

14:41.010 --> 14:43.752
<i>The video that we all saw,</i> <i>
he was proposing.</i>

14:43.795 --> 14:46.189
<i>And now you're saying</i> <i>
that it was a breakup video.</i>

14:46.233 --> 14:48.713
So what, is he just, like,
lying to our faces.

14:48.757 --> 14:51.891
So I had a thirsty ex

14:51.934 --> 14:54.502
who's looking for attention
and went and put that out

14:54.545 --> 14:55.982
to try to humiliate me
and embarrass me.

14:56.025 --> 14:57.984
I'm actually
very proud of that.

14:58.027 --> 15:00.116
I'm proud of my work
and what I've done.

15:00.160 --> 15:01.726
I've marked it on my chest.

15:01.770 --> 15:03.163
That video came
from that situation.

15:03.206 --> 15:04.512
Are you guys happy now?

15:04.555 --> 15:06.601
It's about
a grown-up conversation.

15:06.644 --> 15:07.994
But what are you mad about?

15:08.037 --> 15:10.692
I don't like
people gossiping--

15:10.735 --> 15:12.389
Well, everybody's
gonna gossip, Teresa.

15:12.433 --> 15:13.869
Well,
I don't ----ing like it.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.871
Friend that you ----ing
hang out with every day,

15:15.915 --> 15:18.178
Jennifer,
----ing gossips about me.

15:18.221 --> 15:20.528
She called me a crook.
Is that okay with you?

15:20.571 --> 15:22.834
It's not, but you hang out
with her, right?

15:22.878 --> 15:24.836
<i>Jennifer spread vicious lies</i> <i>
about me</i>

15:24.880 --> 15:26.055
<i>all over the Internet.</i>

15:26.099 --> 15:27.752
I deal with a lot of banks,

15:27.796 --> 15:30.581
and her little petty bullsh--
cost me a big deal.

15:30.625 --> 15:33.367
Oh, hello? You hang out

15:33.410 --> 15:35.282
What did I say
that was so bad?

15:35.325 --> 15:38.024
- She brought up the video.
- Big ----ing deal!

15:38.067 --> 15:39.895
And you ----ing went
after Jennifer.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.810
- I didn't go after Jennifer.
- Yes, you did.

15:41.853 --> 15:42.985
- I didn't.
- Oh, my God.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.421
You should be ashamed
of yourself.

15:44.465 --> 15:46.858
What you did to me was cruel.

15:46.902 --> 15:48.599
No, and by the way,
no, it wasn't.

15:48.643 --> 15:51.037
Jennifer, you've done
mean things to me

15:51.080 --> 15:52.560
your whole life,
since I've known you.

15:52.603 --> 15:53.865
I'm a slut.

15:53.909 --> 15:56.825
You chastised me
for cheating on my husband.

15:56.868 --> 15:59.219
When I talk about things,
don't you insult my things?

15:59.262 --> 16:01.003
Not if it's in my backyard!

16:01.047 --> 16:04.050
Because Bill and I are

24:19.370 --> 24:20.981
Last night
she called me bitch boy.

24:21.024 --> 24:22.591
She called you a bitch
because her husband walks

24:22.635 --> 24:23.940
to the other end of the pier

24:23.984 --> 24:25.551
as she's in
another woman's face.

24:25.594 --> 24:28.510
I mean, Bill has checked
out of the building.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.557
I'm not really in the mood
for coffee.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.342
My stomach's a little upset.
- It was a rough night.

24:34.385 --> 24:37.911
It was like all three of them
ganging up on me,

24:37.954 --> 24:40.000
and you just,
like, stood there.

24:40.043 --> 24:41.436
You were in the back.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.090
I don't know if you were
finishing your meal.

24:43.133 --> 24:44.395
You were a little busy.

24:44.439 --> 24:45.875
You wanted me
to get in the middle of it.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.268
Just so you understand,

24:47.311 --> 24:49.183
that would have been
a real physical fight.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.446
But you didn't say anything.
You didn't show anything.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.188
"He didn't defend her once.
He probably can't stand her."

24:54.231 --> 24:56.407
That's probably what
they're thinking right now.

24:56.451 --> 24:58.671
<i>I mean, Jennifer,</i> <i>
where do I even begin?</i>

24:58.714 --> 25:02.196
Bill wanted no part of that.
Where was he?

25:02.239 --> 25:04.546
But to be honest with you,
when I made that comment

25:04.590 --> 25:06.330
about Bill
sticking his dick in someone,

25:06.374 --> 25:09.203
I made it in the context of,
like, I felt bad for Jennifer.

25:09.246 --> 25:11.031
Now we exposed Bill.

25:11.074 --> 25:12.641
I feel worse for Jen
than I feel for Bill.

25:12.685 --> 25:14.861
How about you don't stick
your dick in someone else?

25:14.904 --> 25:17.733
She took all the blame for
the pain that Bill was feeling,

25:17.777 --> 25:19.561
when it was Bill
who did something.

25:19.605 --> 25:23.217
When there's talk of infidelity
about your husband,

25:23.260 --> 25:24.827
I know how much that hurts you.

25:24.871 --> 25:27.395
And I told her, you are going
through it right now,

25:27.438 --> 25:29.571
and I've been through it, and I
would like to be there for you.

25:29.615 --> 25:32.400
<i>So for Jennifer to think</i> <i>
that I was doing anything</i>

25:32.443 --> 25:35.011
to add to her pain
is very upsetting.

25:35.055 --> 25:37.536

all of that friendship

25:37.579 --> 25:38.928

some contradictory comments

breaking up with that woman,

he's proposing to her.

25:55.641 --> 25:58.600
He just changes the narrative
to whatever perspective

25:58.644 --> 25:59.949

Teresa did not want Louie
to address the video.

"If you tell me to not talk
again, I'm leaving."

26:17.053 --> 26:18.402

What are you guys
talking about?

41:17.213 --> 41:18.780
The crook thing.

41:18.824 --> 41:20.695
Listen, if somebody called
you a crook, I'd back you up.

41:20.739 --> 41:22.175
You understand that?

41:22.218 --> 41:23.568
You got to understand that.

41:23.611 --> 41:25.831
She called him
a little pussy bitch.

41:25.874 --> 41:27.789
She pointed her finger
and said,

41:27.833 --> 41:30.531
"Joe, you're a little bitch boy
for defending Melissa."

41:30.575 --> 41:32.664
You should have said, "Don't
talk to my brother like that."

41:34.230 --> 41:35.884

I'd be like,
"He's my bitch boy."

why the would you

"friends with Traci and Tiki
if they're sitting there be

41:46.068 --> 41:48.288
calling the man
I love a little bitch boy?"

41:48.331 --> 41:49.811
Who cares
about the bitch thing?

41:49.855 --> 41:52.945
You have to stand up for Joe
and Melissa as a family.

41:52.988 --> 41:55.251
You guys are family.
- No, listen--

41:55.295 --> 41:57.079
and stand up 100%
for each other

41:57.123 --> 41:58.428
