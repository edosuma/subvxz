<i>Previously on</i> Californication...

00:01.983 --> 00:04.406
I can't believe you made me get
a vasectomy.

00:04.667 --> 00:07.064
- What do you know about it?
- I know you fucked and punched him,

00:07.406 --> 00:09.311
set him up, stole his book.

00:09.572 --> 00:11.001
What are you gonna do about it?

00:11.175 --> 00:14.483
- You guys are officially back together?
- Until we fuck it up.

00:14.781 --> 00:16.840
We're going to this party
up in Laurel Canyon.

00:19.049 --> 00:20.021
What the fuck!

00:20.355 --> 00:22.992
I leave you alone for 2 seconds.
You're not supposed to do that.

00:23.254 --> 00:25.261
- What are you doing?
- Assuming the posish.

00:25.795 --> 00:26.962
I'll be right back.

Lew, this fucking perv just tried
to mouthrape me.

00:40.279 --> 00:43.033
- I accidently went down on her.
- How is that possible ?

00:43.816 --> 00:45.920
- Have you been drinking, sir?
- Hours ago...

00:46.090 --> 00:47.300
Out of the car.

00:47.470 --> 00:50.019
Why don't you just mind
your own fucking buisiness?

01:12.111 --> 01:13.163
Silent treament?

01:13.930 --> 01:14.580
Yes.

01:15.779 --> 01:17.728
- How long?
- Hard to say.

01:18.043 --> 01:20.707
You think we can skip the part
where I apologize profusely

01:20.877 --> 01:22.906
and tell you
what a lame parental figure I am?

01:23.703 --> 01:24.486
No.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.189
- I'm sorry.
- I know.

01:27.728 --> 01:28.512
Me too.

01:29.235 --> 01:30.359
Why are you sorry?

01:31.008 --> 01:32.728
Because we're not bailing you out.

01:33.070 --> 01:35.497
- You shitting me?
- I shit you not.

01:36.468 --> 01:38.734
Mom says you should
use this time to think.

01:39.052 --> 01:41.103
About what? How much my balls ache?

01:41.483 --> 01:42.838
What about Mom's heart?

01:43.287 --> 01:45.174
Don't you think that aches a bit too?

01:49.440 --> 01:50.579
<i>Touché</i>, daughter.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.509
Check it out.

01:54.253 --> 01:55.625
You're on the*****

02:00.167 --> 02:03.202
- It's a pretty good picture.
- I thought so.

02:10.959 --> 02:12.322
I'll work on her.

02:13.809 --> 02:15.067
In the meantime,

02:15.677 --> 02:17.406
don't bend over for the soap.

03:10.020 --> 03:12.078
- What's the occasion?
- Do we need an occasion?

03:12.248 --> 03:14.053
Life is good, business is better.

03:14.223 --> 03:16.599
Let's party while this bitch
can still get wet!

03:17.094 --> 03:18.426
You guys are great together.

03:18.596 --> 03:20.800
Baby, tonight we are kicking it
old school.

03:20.970 --> 03:23.372
Condoms, coke and lobster claws.

03:23.795 --> 03:24.940
Meet me after work.

03:26.009 --> 03:27.430
I reserved our favorite room.

03:27.735 --> 03:29.978
- Marce...
- Don't "marce" me, short bus.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.945
Turn over. I got to get your tail.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.441
You don't want me to step outside?

03:38.615 --> 03:40.936
Please, I've had way grosser dudes than you

03:41.106 --> 03:43.485
staring into the busines end of my cudra all day long.

03:43.655 --> 03:44.694
Porn.

03:44.954 --> 03:46.049
Thanks, got it.

03:46.219 --> 03:48.325
- How's that working for you?
- I don't know.

03:48.535 --> 03:49.848
I mean, I love it, I do.

03:50.018 --> 03:52.841
But I'm just not getting
the kind of jobs I really want.

03:53.011 --> 03:56.048
You gotta be careful, one wrong move
and you end up the asslicker.

03:57.163 --> 03:58.640
Unloath to ask.

03:58.999 --> 04:01.543
You're watching some porn,
and there is two girls and a guy.

04:01.883 --> 04:04.454
One girl, she's clearly the star,
but the other one...

04:04.624 --> 04:08.171
She ends up tonging the dude's balloon knot while he fucks the shit out of the leading lady.

04:08.910 --> 04:12.520
That's why I'm afraid of:
chocolate starfish duty.

04:13.851 --> 04:15.579
You're far too pretty for such things.

04:15.752 --> 04:17.279
- You really think so?
- I do.

04:17.454 --> 04:19.827
You could cross over.
Go mainstream. I've seen it happen.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.457
Don't tell her that.

04:21.627 --> 04:24.433
Don't fill her pretty little head
full of Hollywood bullshit.

04:24.695 --> 04:27.101
She does what she does
and she's good at it.

04:27.326 --> 04:28.462
That's the secret.

04:28.632 --> 04:31.419
You find your fucking niche
and you stick to it.

04:31.850 --> 04:34.776
Like me: I could branch out.
I could diversify.

04:35.350 --> 04:37.713
But no! I wax hairy tacos.

04:38.163 --> 04:41.116
Maybe I bleech an asshole or two.
That's my thing.

04:41.470 --> 04:43.685
One wrong move,
you end up the asslicker.

04:44.524 --> 04:45.801
Words to live by.

04:46.322 --> 04:47.210
Give me some.

04:50.414 --> 04:51.844
Yeah, Charlie Runkle.

04:53.031 --> 04:55.401
No, he's not at a meeting,
He hates meetings. Come on.

04:55.571 --> 04:56.757
Try his cell.

04:57.394 --> 05:00.467
Don't hang up, listen. Tell him Hank Moody called.
Tell him they set bail.

05:01.359 --> 05:02.246
Just...

05:04.483 --> 05:05.494
One more.

05:06.213 --> 05:07.664
I'm trying to reach my agent.

05:08.138 --> 05:11.436
Maybe you should think about
new representation, homie.

05:11.664 --> 05:13.448
Everybody is a fucking comedian.

05:21.207 --> 05:22.875
What the fuck?

05:27.288 --> 05:28.063
What?

05:28.873 --> 05:30.132
You touched my ass.

05:31.314 --> 05:33.168
Not my thing man, trust me.

05:36.851 --> 05:39.901
My sweet sexy ass,
and you touched it.

05:42.721 --> 05:44.000
Can't say I blame you.

05:44.816 --> 05:46.202
What are you on?
I want some.

05:59.314 --> 06:00.696
Now you're looking at it.

06:00.866 --> 06:03.386
You're not giving me a whole lot
of choice in the matter, are you?

06:03.879 --> 06:05.060
A beauty, ain't it?

06:06.095 --> 06:08.620
This nice white mid-crowd ass of mine.

06:08.973 --> 06:11.640
There's no place like home,
there's no place like home.

06:13.570 --> 06:15.620
Prisoner coming in on the gates.

06:30.854 --> 06:31.654
You?

06:33.082 --> 06:34.167
I know you.

06:34.602 --> 06:35.603
Last night.

06:35.723 --> 06:38.351
The whole cunilingus switcharoo
incident.

06:38.511 --> 06:39.970
- Right!
- Mouthrape!

06:41.903 --> 06:42.951
That chick?

06:43.071 --> 06:45.358
Stone freak.
I ended up banging these other two.

06:45.518 --> 06:48.528
She flips out, calls the cops,
cries domestic abuse.

06:50.100 --> 06:52.235
I'm pretty sure I never
laid a hand on her.

06:53.798 --> 06:54.734
Lew Ashby.

06:55.167 --> 06:56.269
Hank Moody.

07:02.670 --> 07:03.609
The writer?

07:03.938 --> 07:06.379
- So how's the script coming?
- Really good!

07:06.539 --> 07:09.775
I don't see what the big deal is.
Screenplays are easy.

07:10.163 --> 07:14.104
- What's hard is adapting your own work.
- Sure, sure, I would imagine.

07:14.314 --> 07:17.724
I bet you just look at those pages
sometimes and have no idea

07:17.884 --> 07:19.896
where all that brilliance came from.

07:20.253 --> 07:24.230
As one of my agents, I would think
you'd be a whole lot nicer to me.

07:24.571 --> 07:27.278
- I would think so too.
- You know what? Ladies, just

07:27.398 --> 07:29.635
don't gang bang up on me, please.

07:29.996 --> 07:33.005
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
You sweaty little perv.

07:34.841 --> 07:36.172
I've got a meeting.

07:36.895 --> 07:40.813
Good luck. Just be yourself
and a little cleavage is always good.

07:41.081 --> 07:42.273
Done, and...

07:42.770 --> 07:43.583
done.

07:43.743 --> 07:45.752
Don't you have a school to attend,
somewhere?

07:45.912 --> 07:49.000
If it's all the same to you,, I think
I'd rather sit down with David Finsher.

07:49.120 --> 07:51.149
Word of advice:
if he's about to cum,

07:51.269 --> 07:54.484
just let him cum.
Don't punch the poor guy in the face.

07:54.604 --> 07:55.404
Dick.

07:59.616 --> 08:02.305
- What's your problem?
- She's an important client.

08:02.425 --> 08:05.125
- Not to me.
- She is to me and the agency.

08:05.245 --> 08:07.707
She is everything that's wrong
with Hollywood right now.

08:08.073 --> 08:09.521
Much like youself.

08:09.969 --> 08:12.979
- How the mighty have fallen.
- What's that supposed to mean?

08:13.326 --> 08:15.051
You've gone soft, Charlie.

08:15.535 --> 08:18.284
You lost that killer instinct
I used to admire so much.

08:18.444 --> 08:21.136
I see, you've been an agent now for...
What is it? 3 whole months.

08:21.256 --> 08:24.290
- You got it all figured out now?
- I love what I do. I know that much.

08:24.534 --> 08:27.660
Blackmailing your way into a career
doesn't make you a good agent.

08:29.029 --> 08:32.626
- No, just a successful one.
- I'm sorry I ever spanked you.

08:34.102 --> 08:34.993
I'm not.

08:38.957 --> 08:40.361
I miss you, boss.

08:42.236 --> 08:43.635
I miss our little...

08:45.263 --> 08:46.236
playdates.

08:57.114 --> 08:58.591
Wrong move, Charlie.

08:58.751 --> 09:01.427
Wow you are just totally
bad shit crazy now, aren't you?

09:03.954 --> 09:05.260
A year from now,

09:06.413 --> 09:08.634
when you're selling BMWs in the Valley,

09:09.433 --> 09:12.368
- remember this moment.
- I've had enough of this, alright?

09:12.488 --> 09:14.878
It's time I go have
a little chat with our president.

09:15.001 --> 09:16.968
He's had his share of psycho
hose bag assistants.

09:17.088 --> 09:18.845
I'm thinking he's gonna have my back.

09:19.248 --> 09:20.746
Don't go there, Charlie.

09:21.021 --> 09:24.059
Instead, maybe it's time
to think about doing something

09:24.179 --> 09:26.454
a little bit different
with your skill set.

09:26.574 --> 09:27.920
What about producing?

09:28.080 --> 09:30.890
The only thing I'd like to produce
right now is a fist up your ass.

09:31.196 --> 09:33.593
Once upon a time
I might have taken you up on that.

09:35.745 --> 09:37.060
Good luck, boss.

09:43.125 --> 09:45.108
You've got a lot of fans
in the music business.

09:45.648 --> 09:46.668
Ah? Yeah?

09:47.659 --> 09:49.130
Your writing always had this

09:49.250 --> 09:51.454
"in your face rock and roll energy"
to it.

09:51.574 --> 09:53.954
Dolorès Thomson
meets the last Stoogees on.

09:54.812 --> 09:57.557
God hates us all.
How was your Gatsby?

09:58.095 --> 10:00.478
- What happened to you, man?
- What happened to me?

10:02.359 --> 10:04.969
I came out here from New York
to fight the good fight.

10:05.089 --> 10:07.298
I lost.
This fucking city happened to me.

10:07.418 --> 10:09.462
Please. All you haters can go

10:09.622 --> 10:12.193
fellate yourselves.
I mean, always whining about L.A.

10:12.313 --> 10:15.801
and how New York is like a holy land.
Go the fuck move back there.

10:16.103 --> 10:19.329
The sheer amount of talent in this town,
any given time?

10:19.723 --> 10:22.594
Mind-boggling. That caveman over there,
farting in his sleep?

10:22.714 --> 10:25.573
One of the greatest
rock n' roll guitar players of all time.

10:27.884 --> 10:29.065
I got a...

10:29.664 --> 10:31.461
I got this book deal.

10:32.471 --> 10:34.474
You wanna write about
why everything I touch

10:34.594 --> 10:37.592
turns to gold or platinum,
zirconium or some sick shit

10:37.712 --> 10:41.421
*** is trying to push these dweeby
Rolling Stone writers on me?

10:43.247 --> 10:44.370
You'll write it.

10:44.883 --> 10:46.299
Be my buzz well.

10:47.397 --> 10:50.303
Slow down, there, charm school.
I don't put out on the first date.

10:50.463 --> 10:53.940
I'm not trying to put in your pale,
I got instincts about these things.

10:54.418 --> 10:56.489
Yeah, but I'm one of the haters.

10:56.609 --> 10:59.220
I'm actually doing something about it.
I'm moving back to Mecca.

10:59.340 --> 11:01.828
Bullshit, not going anywhere.
You took a swing at a cop,

11:01.948 --> 11:03.981
- you need a bucket lawyer.
- Ashby!

11:04.101 --> 11:06.285
A good lawyer is everything.
I got a great one.

11:08.043 --> 11:09.455
Good hanging with you Moody

11:09.615 --> 11:11.457
- Ashby!
- Get writing again.

11:11.826 --> 11:12.647
Peace.

11:15.035 --> 11:16.079
Thank you.

11:25.576 --> 11:29.028
Okay, look. I know I'm supposed
to be like a sister here, but...

11:29.198 --> 11:31.113
not like he did it on purpose.

11:31.586 --> 11:32.493
Sonia,

11:33.248 --> 11:36.348
you slept with the father of my child
in my very own bed

11:36.518 --> 11:40.335
and then you vomited all over it.
I would never accuse you of being a sister.

11:40.597 --> 11:43.559
- You hooked me up with him so I mean...
- What was I thinking?

11:43.729 --> 11:45.254
I'm sorry about the comforter.

11:46.194 --> 11:47.108
You ready?

11:47.652 --> 11:48.463
For what?

11:49.561 --> 11:50.378
My pitch.

11:50.900 --> 11:53.348
What are you, peddling screenplays now ?

11:53.610 --> 11:54.768
God, no.

11:55.202 --> 11:56.155
I think we

11:56.767 --> 11:58.306
should go into business together.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.322
I'm flattered, really.

12:00.869 --> 12:02.786
Thank you. But this is a...

12:03.386 --> 12:07.062
This is kind of a hard time for me
right now. The house is on the market,

12:07.324 --> 12:09.081
and I'm interviewing for jobs and...

12:09.458 --> 12:10.585
How would you feel

12:10.854 --> 12:13.468
about restoring an original *Locke* house with me?

12:13.949 --> 12:16.419
- Don't fuck with me.
- I'm not.

12:17.812 --> 12:19.307
I'm bidding on one tomorrow.

12:20.419 --> 12:21.904
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

12:23.933 --> 12:26.055
I got some things to say to you.
Some of it ugly,

12:26.175 --> 12:27.984
some of it embarrassing,
but all of it true.

12:28.104 --> 12:30.245
I am not going down without a fight.

12:56.306 --> 12:57.356
So... what?

12:58.218 --> 13:00.121
You're gonna shitcan
15 years of experience

13:00.241 --> 13:02.017
because a guy messes up one time?

13:29.682 --> 13:32.747
Okay, that's it! I'm ankling!

13:34.311 --> 13:35.540
Runkle is ankling!

13:47.354 --> 13:48.868
Okay, Becca? Dinner.

13:51.042 --> 13:53.022
What are you up to, young lady?

13:53.396 --> 13:56.104
How long are you going to let my father
rot in jail?

13:58.791 --> 14:00.642
Look, I know this is hard for you.

14:01.414 --> 14:03.645
But your father has to understand

14:03.907 --> 14:06.278
that there are consequences
to his actions, OK?

14:06.448 --> 14:08.057
He can't just go around saying

14:08.227 --> 14:10.985
and doing exactly what he wants
at all times.

14:11.247 --> 14:12.785
I mean, you get that, right?

14:17.387 --> 14:18.426
- Hey!
- Hey!

14:19.922 --> 14:21.349
- What's this?
- Galley proofs.

14:21.574 --> 14:25.296
Once upon a time, before you humiliated
my father on his wedding night,

14:25.602 --> 14:28.548
you promised to read my book.
High time I collect, don't you think?

14:28.718 --> 14:30.338
You're right, I did, and I will.

14:30.772 --> 14:32.045
I wanna read it.

14:32.902 --> 14:35.543
I think this one might be
a little too NC-17, for you, Juno.

14:36.741 --> 14:38.409
What are you talking about?

14:38.579 --> 14:41.449
I've read all my father's books,
I'm sure I can handle yours.

14:43.201 --> 14:45.220
Where is the esteemed author
this evening?

14:46.522 --> 14:47.909
In the big house.

14:51.110 --> 14:52.727
Jail. He's in jail.

14:53.596 --> 14:56.297
- No shit. What did he do?
- I'm not allowed to know.

14:57.044 --> 15:00.485
Because I don't wanna turn you
off men for the rest of your life.

15:00.798 --> 15:03.768
What are we gonna do? Shouldn't we be
calling Chico's Bail Bonds?

15:03.938 --> 15:07.342
- Mom thinks he needs time to think.
- He does need time.

15:07.604 --> 15:10.189
What if all he's thinking is
some cholo tosses his salad?

15:10.359 --> 15:11.044
Mia.

15:11.574 --> 15:13.014
What does that mean?

15:13.759 --> 15:14.736
Nothing good.

15:15.950 --> 15:18.137
I gotta say I don't approve
of this course of action.

15:18.257 --> 15:21.460
For all his faults, Hank's a lover.
Not a fighter.

15:21.851 --> 15:23.825
And he's far too pretty for jail, mom.

15:24.505 --> 15:26.281
What if he's someone's bitch right now?

15:26.731 --> 15:28.396
Instead of being yours?

15:29.994 --> 15:32.375
That is not fair... Or nice.

15:32.652 --> 15:34.423
He is who he is, Mom.

15:34.593 --> 15:37.095
You knew that
when you jumped into the car with us.

15:37.265 --> 15:40.408
If you're worried you made a mistake,
that's not his fault.

15:41.255 --> 15:43.523
You have to love him for who he is.

15:44.430 --> 15:46.014
And not his potential.

15:49.491 --> 15:50.719
No, no, sweetie.

15:54.883 --> 15:55.685
Shit.

15:56.867 --> 15:58.922
- Could you watch her?
- Sure.

15:59.186 --> 16:01.286
- Where are you going?
- To bail him out.

16:01.456 --> 16:02.463
Because that

16:02.855 --> 16:03.835
is the...

16:04.053 --> 16:06.206
infuriating magic of Hank.

16:07.452 --> 16:10.041
You can never stay mad at him
for very long.

16:10.455 --> 16:11.655
I'll be back

16:11.825 --> 16:13.047
with the Hank.

16:17.950 --> 16:18.761
Dude?

16:19.065 --> 16:21.780
You ate the wrong pussy.
That's all there is to it.

16:21.950 --> 16:23.644
That shit is fucked up.

16:24.243 --> 16:25.307
Beyond fucked up.

16:25.683 --> 16:26.408
Fuck!

16:26.975 --> 16:29.029
If I got a caught munching
the wrong rug,

16:29.518 --> 16:31.546
the woman would go all Lorena Bobbitt
on my ass.

16:31.978 --> 16:33.328
My sweet sexy ass.

16:33.741 --> 16:35.230
Moody! You're out of here.

16:37.282 --> 16:39.000
Gentlemen... Lady...

16:39.415 --> 16:41.923
It's been a slice. Let's keep in touch.

16:47.075 --> 16:49.311
- You?
- That's right, motherfucker.

16:50.242 --> 16:53.615
- Why the fuck would you bail me out?
- Why the fuck not?

16:54.172 --> 16:56.684
- It's mighty white of you.
- It's only money.

16:57.124 --> 16:58.871
Now, you got to drink with me.

16:59.041 --> 17:02.124
I hate to seem unappreciative,
but I got some girls back home

17:02.294 --> 17:05.133
who deserve the full-court press
on this one so I'm gonna have to pass.

17:05.301 --> 17:07.415
Come on.
One drink and then, I'll drop you off.

17:08.130 --> 17:08.799
One.

17:09.358 --> 17:10.119
Come on.

17:11.294 --> 17:12.967
Yes. Silence is a yes.

17:20.701 --> 17:22.175
Oh, my balls...

17:31.714 --> 17:32.897
Take a whiff...

17:33.871 --> 17:35.856
Smell the history.
This was Led Zeppelin's table.

17:35.976 --> 17:39.343
Jimmy fucking Page used to get
under-the-table oral from Miss Pamela

17:39.646 --> 17:40.562
right here.

17:40.943 --> 17:43.532
I bet you could still scrape
some of his DNA off the floor.

17:43.792 --> 17:46.154
First album I ever bought
with my own money. Zeppelin II.

17:46.437 --> 17:49.018
You had good taste.
Mine was Captain and Tennille.

17:49.188 --> 17:51.678
- I was a homo until I heard the hard stuff.
- Indeed.

17:52.055 --> 17:53.094
Want a blow job?

17:53.544 --> 17:55.563
I think that might ruin the friendship.

17:55.835 --> 17:58.547
Take your pick. I'll hook you up. Her?

17:58.807 --> 18:00.614
- Her? Him?
- No, I'm...

18:00.794 --> 18:02.518
I'm good. I had a big breakfast.

18:02.778 --> 18:05.754
Okay.
You have a problem with blow jobs?

18:06.014 --> 18:07.821
Actually, I'm a big fan of the blow job.

18:08.179 --> 18:10.681
As long as she uses 2 hands
and doesn't meander too much

18:10.850 --> 18:13.079
I just have a woman at home
who might not appreciate

18:13.199 --> 18:15.431
somebody else's lips
wrapped around my monkey.

18:15.691 --> 18:18.439
I imagine she's still a little miffed
about the accidental mouth thing.

18:18.559 --> 18:20.436
You would imagine correctly, right.

18:20.894 --> 18:21.980
Any...

18:23.877 --> 18:25.153
Titsuckers ?

18:25.473 --> 18:26.844
A daughter, Rebecca.

18:27.475 --> 18:29.826
Magic. Plays the guitar.

18:30.039 --> 18:31.847
Loves the heavy metal,
worships Satan.

18:32.107 --> 18:35.817
Shucks. You got yourself a little fam-damly, Moody.

18:37.029 --> 18:38.740
Which is why you should write my

18:38.980 --> 18:41.290
fucking book,
'cause you need to provide for them.

18:41.460 --> 18:43.697
You know what...
What am I going to write about ?

18:44.552 --> 18:47.229
What you were born
a poor Black child, now you're an icon

18:47.399 --> 18:49.795
everything you touch turns to gold.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.297
No offense but I need a bigger theme.

19:08.572 --> 19:10.552
- Thanks, sweetheart.
- Anytime.

19:10.759 --> 19:12.083
Job well done.

19:15.370 --> 19:16.091
Cool.

19:17.281 --> 19:18.296
Very cool.

19:20.045 --> 19:21.830
Let's find ourselves a bigger theme?

19:26.281 --> 19:28.131
Hang the fucking Pope.

19:29.126 --> 19:30.325
You want some, Daddy?

19:32.419 --> 19:33.695
I gotta tell you something.

19:37.773 --> 19:41.483
- I gotta fucking tell you something.
- What? What do you gotta tell me?

19:46.642 --> 19:47.689
I love you.

19:49.482 --> 19:51.126
I fucking love you, babe.

19:51.516 --> 19:52.791
You wanna fuck?

19:52.961 --> 19:54.902
You could choke me if you want.

19:55.140 --> 19:56.084
Just a little.

19:57.141 --> 19:58.720
I don't know if I can do it anymore.

19:58.894 --> 20:01.488
It's cool, take it easy, baby,
slow down.

20:01.658 --> 20:03.305
I won't boggy any of yours.

20:03.565 --> 20:05.604
Not the blow, the job, Jesus Christ,

20:05.774 --> 20:08.133
Marce, you gotta listen to me
once in a while.

20:08.303 --> 20:11.499
OK, OK, but what the fuck
are you talking about ?

20:11.937 --> 20:14.769
You love your job,
you were born to be a ten-percenter.

20:15.019 --> 20:17.556
No, babe, I gotta get off the train.
It's fucking killing me.

20:17.726 --> 20:18.971
Like, you know what?

20:19.623 --> 20:20.975
Maybe I need to produce.

20:22.149 --> 20:23.173
Fuck that.

20:23.332 --> 20:25.962
Fucking asslicker, you're not creative.

20:26.669 --> 20:29.565
You haven't had an original thought
since the day we met.

20:29.825 --> 20:31.118
Which isn't a bad thing.

20:31.276 --> 20:33.845
You need to sell, it is what you do.

20:34.025 --> 20:35.809
And you do the shit out of it.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.370
But what if I couldn't?

20:37.490 --> 20:40.175
What if, all of a sudden,
I just... I fuckin' couldn't?

20:40.435 --> 20:43.979
Like what? Like if you end up in a fucking
wheelchair, all tweaked and shit.

20:44.239 --> 20:47.745
You're not fuckin' listening to me,
you never fuckin' listen to me.

20:51.813 --> 20:54.346
I'm listening, baby. I'm right here.

21:02.537 --> 21:05.100
What the fuck, you're supposed
to be taking me home.

21:05.594 --> 21:09.039
I just thought I would give you a little
something to put in your book.

21:11.294 --> 21:13.535
We drove out here together
in a beat shit,

21:13.705 --> 21:15.892
a Mustang that didn't go in reverse
anymore.

21:16.062 --> 21:19.430
I was gonna be a guitar hero and she was
gonna design my stage clothes.

21:20.294 --> 21:23.000
I ended up producing,
she ended up alone.

21:23.877 --> 21:24.906
All the time.

21:25.651 --> 21:26.936
She wanted the house.

21:27.986 --> 21:29.590
I wanted the freedom.

21:32.079 --> 21:33.665
Sure as fuck got it.

21:34.329 --> 21:36.086
Now I drink what I want,

21:37.029 --> 21:38.293
snort what I want,

21:39.482 --> 21:40.704
fuck what I want.

21:42.996 --> 21:44.550
All I want is her.

21:48.683 --> 21:50.036
Just go knock on her door.

21:50.895 --> 21:52.117
Fuck that.

21:52.986 --> 21:54.599
Not nearly drunk enough for that.

21:56.059 --> 21:57.409
- Thank you.
- For what?

21:57.805 --> 22:01.105
- Reminding me to call my old lady.
- The one that didn't bail you out?

22:01.947 --> 22:04.176
Probably what I dig most about her.

22:07.433 --> 22:08.226
Karen?

22:09.286 --> 22:10.100
Marcy.

22:11.943 --> 22:13.128
Hold on a sec, what?

22:13.647 --> 22:16.471
Is somebody crying?
Charlie's crying, what the...

22:17.392 --> 22:18.823
You guys are fuckin' retarded.

22:28.721 --> 22:30.427
Wassup, cocky smurf?

22:30.846 --> 22:33.337
He's saying some shit about not wanting
to be an agent anymore.

22:33.548 --> 22:36.424
- I didn't know what to do.
- You did the right thing, half pint.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.344
Runkle, open up.

22:39.773 --> 22:41.294
Charlie, come on, let me in.

22:41.691 --> 22:42.580
Charlie?

22:44.026 --> 22:44.938
Charlie?

22:46.287 --> 22:47.268
Come on.

22:48.143 --> 22:49.137
Charlie!

22:57.046 --> 22:58.717
What the fuck, Runkle?

22:59.757 --> 23:00.948
I got the axe today.

23:01.757 --> 23:03.108
You got fired?

23:03.485 --> 23:05.186
Why the fuck didn't you tell me?

23:05.448 --> 23:06.591
I tried.

23:06.815 --> 23:08.621
You weren't fucking listening!

23:08.791 --> 23:11.659
You never fucking
listen to me anymore.

23:11.921 --> 23:14.395
Right, I never listen to you.
Got it.

23:14.657 --> 23:15.563
Asshole.

23:16.381 --> 23:18.888
Scarface, you're not helping.
Go elsewhere.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.839
Okay big boy, lay it on me.

23:30.805 --> 23:32.698
Well, help yourself, whatever.

23:41.955 --> 23:43.673
They shitcanned my ass.

23:44.203 --> 23:47.434
Which makes total sense,
my heart wasn't in it anymore.

23:47.554 --> 23:48.559
Well...

23:49.010 --> 23:50.615
that and the masturbation videos.

23:52.376 --> 23:53.752
Do I even wanna know?

23:54.336 --> 23:55.780
It's sobering Hank.

23:56.630 --> 23:59.725
- Seeing yourself make faces like that.
- I hear you.

24:00.170 --> 24:03.095
No man should ever have
to bear witness to his o-face.

24:03.374 --> 24:04.229
Word.

24:07.087 --> 24:08.848
What's the worse that can happen?

24:08.968 --> 24:11.028
You never work again in this town?

24:11.148 --> 24:12.271
No, okay! Look,

24:12.391 --> 24:14.424
No, sorry, sorry, look.

24:15.166 --> 24:17.984
Let's cross that bridge
when we inevitably come to it.

24:18.104 --> 24:20.779
Look, but till then...
it's me and you broheme.

24:21.174 --> 24:24.238
I'm with you, through Hill and Dale,
through hell and back.

24:24.358 --> 24:26.067
- That's nice.
- I'm right behind you.

24:26.187 --> 24:28.431
But you don't bring in any money.

24:29.633 --> 24:32.321
Just so happens,
Lew Ashby is out there right now.

24:32.441 --> 24:34.092
Wants me to write his biography.

24:34.478 --> 24:36.634
Really? That's a big deal.

24:36.930 --> 24:39.131
They've been trying to put a writer²on that for a while.

24:39.291 --> 24:40.766
Things are looking up already.

24:41.467 --> 24:43.597
You done with your bath there
Kingdog?

24:45.697 --> 24:49.144
Let's towel you off, big boy.
What's with the bib, Bob, come on?

24:49.264 --> 24:50.809
I ate some crustacean.

24:50.969 --> 24:53.424
You look like you crawled out
of a dumpster behind the redlobster.

24:53.544 --> 24:55.712
You smell like a mermaid, asspack.

25:49.606 --> 25:52.437
Any points for saying I'm sorry
in a romance language?

25:53.223 --> 25:54.389
I don't know.

25:57.807 --> 26:00.779
I'll think about it next time
I'm going down on the wrong guy.

26:01.812 --> 26:02.925
Fair enough.

26:03.970 --> 26:06.451
As long as he's thin, bent
and uncircumcized.

26:07.417 --> 26:08.915
That's lovely.

26:14.064 --> 26:15.074
Come to bed.

26:34.974 --> 26:36.129
I'm sorry, baby.

26:37.962 --> 26:38.858
I know.

26:40.611 --> 26:41.531
Me too.

26:44.063 --> 26:45.161
I love you.

26:51.875 --> 26:53.199
I love you too.

26:56.479 --> 26:58.449
But what if that's not enough?

27:03.681 --> 27:05.888
This is not very good pillow talk.

27:07.272 --> 27:08.522
Oh shut up.
