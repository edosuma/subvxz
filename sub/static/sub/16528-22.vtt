00:00.401 --> 00:01.467
ADULT ADAM:
<i> When I was kid,</i>

00:01.469 --> 00:03.235
<i> my mom would use</i>
<i> every opportunity</i>

00:03.237 --> 00:05.904
<i> to squeeze, smooch,</i>
<i> and snuggle her schmoopies.</i>

00:05.906 --> 00:08.007
<i> There was only one time</i>
<i> she expected us</i>

00:08.009 --> 00:10.342
<i> to do it in return...</i>
<i> Mother's Day.</i>

00:10.344 --> 00:12.277
<i> Naturally, we'd use</i>
<i> the opportunity</i>

00:12.279 --> 00:14.146
<i> to mess with her</i>
<i> for a cheap laugh.</i>

00:14.148 --> 00:15.647
Oh, look at my
special calendar

00:15.649 --> 00:17.116
hanging in a
high-traffic area.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.050
How'd that get there?

00:18.052 --> 00:19.485
That's odd.
Didn't notice.

00:19.487 --> 00:21.086
You wanna take a peek,

00:21.088 --> 00:23.389
see if there's
any special day in May

00:23.391 --> 00:24.323
that you need to remember?

00:24.325 --> 00:25.524
Nah, I got Cinco de Mayo
on lock.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.826
I think she's talking
about French Labor Day.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.294
No, it's
<i> Star Wars</i> Day!

00:29.296 --> 00:31.497
May the 4th be
with you, right?

00:31.499 --> 00:32.798
How could I forget!
That's right!

00:32.800 --> 00:34.767
I gotta go shopping.
I love<i> Star Wars</i> Day.

00:34.769 --> 00:36.068
So do I!
No, no.

00:36.070 --> 00:37.169
How did I forget?
Can I give you a hint?

00:37.171 --> 00:38.704
ADULT ADAM:<i> Yep, nothing</i>
<i> brought us kids closer</i>

00:38.706 --> 00:41.440
<i> than using Mother's Day</i>
<i> to torture Beverly Goldberg.</i>

00:41.442 --> 00:44.610
(GASPS) What?
You're home from
school already?

00:44.612 --> 00:45.044
What a surprise.

00:45.046 --> 00:47.813
I was just going through these
beautiful handwritten cards

00:47.815 --> 00:49.281
you gave me
almost a year ago exactly.

00:49.283 --> 00:52.484
Maybe you should come and take
a closer look at this cards,

00:52.486 --> 00:54.286
get a sense
of what they're about

00:54.288 --> 00:55.421
and how they make me feel?

00:55.423 --> 00:56.889
Enough jibber-jabber.

00:56.891 --> 00:58.357
I need a pre-dinner meal...

00:58.359 --> 01:00.726
Maybe something
that'll lay a nice base,

01:00.728 --> 01:01.960
like pancakes.

01:01.962 --> 01:02.694
Screw it. I give up.

01:02.696 --> 01:04.930
Murray, you are taking me
to that Latin place

01:04.932 --> 01:07.166
on Saturday night,
and we are gonna cha-cha

01:07.168 --> 01:08.467
'cause these kids
are ungrateful.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.402
No, I am not
going to cha-cha.

01:10.404 --> 01:13.639
Oh, you will cha-cha,
and I will be dipped.

01:13.641 --> 01:16.475
And you won't drop me
this time.

01:16.477 --> 01:18.677
All right, you've had
enough fun, you morons.

01:18.679 --> 01:20.846
Go tell your mom that
you know it's Mother's Day.

01:20.848 --> 01:23.282
Aw, but we look forward to
torturing her all year long.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.818
It's one of our
better family traditions.

01:25.820 --> 01:26.685
Do it!

01:26.687 --> 01:28.387
(SIGHS) Hey, Mom?

01:28.389 --> 01:32.157
We just realized
that Mother's Day
is this weekend.

01:32.159 --> 01:34.493
What? I had no idea.

01:34.495 --> 01:36.628
Oh, I can't believe
you remembered.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.264
Oh, I just love
my children so much.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.233
Here comes a tearful hug.

01:41.235 --> 01:42.768
Sacrifice the nerd
and run!

01:42.770 --> 01:45.437
(LAUGHING)
Oh, my favorite!

01:45.439 --> 01:47.106
Tell my story!

01:47.108 --> 01:48.474
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

01:48.476 --> 01:52.678
<i> ¶ But nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

01:54.648 --> 01:55.814
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

01:55.816 --> 02:00.285
<i> ¶ But the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

02:00.287 --> 02:02.187
ADULT ADAM:
<i> It was May 3,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

02:02.189 --> 02:04.289
<i> and my brother and his pals</i>
<i> were about to watch</i>

02:04.291 --> 02:06.625
<i> the most famous TV movie</i>
<i> of the decade.</i>

02:06.627 --> 02:08.627
Dad, I demand
you give me the remote

02:08.629 --> 02:11.563
and go make us nachos
as we watch your TV
without you.

02:11.565 --> 02:13.465
Did you really think
that would work?
No.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.134
Yes! Now we're gonna miss
the whole movie.

02:15.136 --> 02:17.669
I got a Sony Watchman.
All we need is
nine batteries.

02:17.671 --> 02:18.770
All we need
is nine batteries.

02:18.772 --> 02:19.972
What are you dummies
going on about?

02:19.974 --> 02:22.941
Tonight, they're airing
a gnarly made-for-TV movie

02:22.943 --> 02:23.675
called<i> The Day After,</i>

02:23.677 --> 02:26.145
where America's in a
nuclear war with Russia.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.279
Ka-boom!
America!

02:27.281 --> 02:27.813
Jason Robards, y'all!

02:27.815 --> 02:30.782
All of the teachers at school
warned us not to see it,

02:30.784 --> 02:31.717
so we have to watch it

02:31.719 --> 02:33.218
to send a clear message
of "Suck it."

02:33.220 --> 02:35.254
If I say yes,
will you shut up?

02:35.256 --> 02:35.721
This is gonna rock!

02:35.723 --> 02:38.724
ADULT ADAM:
<i> But it did not rock.</i>
<i> Not at all.</i>

02:38.726 --> 02:41.727
This does not rock.
Not at all!

02:41.729 --> 02:42.895
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Turns out,</i> The Day After

02:42.897 --> 02:45.264
<i> was a terrifying</i>
<i> and all-too-real depiction</i>

02:45.266 --> 02:47.666
<i> of a small town just like ours</i>
<i> facing the fallout</i>

02:47.668 --> 02:51.336
<i> after the President waged</i>
<i> a horrible nuclear war.</i>

02:51.338 --> 02:52.938
Too real.
War is bad.

02:52.940 --> 02:54.840
So scared.
I'll never be okay.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.441
I like that Steve Guttenberg.

02:56.443 --> 02:57.176
He's got a lot of range.

02:57.178 --> 03:00.012
Dad, don't you care
about what you just saw?

03:00.014 --> 03:01.280
There could be
a mushroom cloud

03:01.282 --> 03:02.281
outside our window
at any moment!

03:02.283 --> 03:05.217
I say, "Bring on the cloud,"
'cause then maybe
you'll shut up

03:05.219 --> 03:06.485
and I can get back
to watching my shows.

03:06.487 --> 03:10.422
ADULT ADAM:
<i> That night, the entire country</i>
<i> watched that movie,</i>

03:10.424 --> 03:11.423
<i> and legit panic ensued.</i>

03:11.425 --> 03:13.559
Okay, students,
even though we
warned you all

03:13.561 --> 03:15.394
not to watch that
terrifying TV movie,

03:15.396 --> 03:17.863
apparently everyone
in this school did,

03:17.865 --> 03:19.398
as well as
100 million other people.

03:19.400 --> 03:22.768
Therefore, we are going to
have an emergency meeting

03:22.770 --> 03:25.504
entitled "The Day After
<i> 'The Day After.'"</i>

03:25.506 --> 03:26.205
Of course,
the gym is booked,

03:26.207 --> 03:29.942
so it'll be "The Day After
The Day After
<i> 'The Day After.'"</i>

03:29.944 --> 03:30.876
So, Wednesday.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.311
Oh, my God.
How are you?

03:32.313 --> 03:33.679
I had nightmares
all night.

03:33.681 --> 03:34.513
I didn't watch
the movie.

03:34.515 --> 03:37.015
I spent the night
organizing my
Garbage Pail Kids

03:37.017 --> 03:37.883
into a protective binder.

03:37.885 --> 03:40.485
Don't want you to feel
like things are going
too fast,

03:40.487 --> 03:41.954
but this is our nest egg.

03:41.956 --> 03:43.388
Well, after watching
that movie,

03:43.390 --> 03:45.991
I realized we don't have
any time to waste.

03:45.993 --> 03:47.726
We should have
our first kiss,

03:47.728 --> 03:48.827
right here, right now.

03:48.829 --> 03:50.796
We talking cheek or lips?

03:55.536 --> 03:56.802
Uh...

03:57.404 --> 03:58.804
Thank you.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.939
I'm a big fan,
big fan of you.

04:00.941 --> 04:03.275
Listen, my parents
are renting a house

04:03.277 --> 04:04.643
at the shore this weekend.

04:04.645 --> 04:05.210
Come with me.

04:05.212 --> 04:06.878
We'll spend each moment
like it's our last.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.380
What is the deal
with this movie?

04:08.382 --> 04:10.349
My mom said
I could bring someone,

04:10.351 --> 04:12.651
Well, okay, then!
so I choose you.

04:15.289 --> 04:18.423
<i> The Day After</i> is
the best movie ever!
(CHUCKLES)

04:18.425 --> 04:22.694
Oh, my God, she just
invited you down the shore!

04:22.696 --> 04:23.161
I know, Dave Kim.

04:23.163 --> 04:25.364
But your mom
will never say yes.
I know, Dave Kim!

04:25.366 --> 04:27.432
You gotta
think of something.
I know, Dave Kim.

04:27.434 --> 04:28.834
ADULT ADAM:<i> Lucky for me,</i>
<i> the timing was perfect.</i>

04:28.836 --> 04:31.270
(BETTE MIDLER'S
<i> WIND BENEATH MY WINGS</i> PLAYS)
<i> It was Mother's Day.</i>

04:31.272 --> 04:33.438
<i> I'd strike hard and fast</i>
<i> with a schmaltzy gift</i>

04:33.440 --> 04:36.074
<i> featuring the vocal power</i>
<i> of Bette Midler.</i>

04:36.076 --> 04:38.443
<i> It would make my mom</i>
<i> say yes to anything.</i>

04:38.445 --> 04:43.181
<i> ¶ I can fly higher</i>
<i> than an eagle</i>

04:45.953 --> 04:52.057
<i> ¶ 'Cause you are the wind</i>
<i> beneath my wings ¶</i>

04:53.160 --> 04:56.795
ADULT ADAM:
<i> Unfortunately, my sister</i>
<i> had the exact same plan.</i>

04:56.797 --> 04:59.264
This is pandering garbage!
You can't do this.

04:59.266 --> 04:59.665
Why not?

04:59.667 --> 05:02.000
Because I'm working
on my own pandering garbage

05:02.002 --> 05:05.370
so that Mom will
let me go to college
5,000 miles away.

05:05.372 --> 05:06.238
Emory is in Georgia.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.106
That's why I need to ask her
on Mother's Day,

05:08.108 --> 05:09.975
when she's all buttered up
and distracted.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.777
But we can't both
lower Mom's defenses

05:11.779 --> 05:14.246
with an insincere, theatrical
show of our love.

05:14.248 --> 05:16.181
Well, you're just
gonna have to back down.

05:16.183 --> 05:19.384
Your dumb thing is
way less important
than college.

05:19.386 --> 05:20.352
But when will
I have the chance

05:20.354 --> 05:22.521
to rub cocoa butter
on my lady's shoulders again?

05:22.523 --> 05:24.523
Honestly, I can't imagine
you ever will.

05:24.525 --> 05:27.125
But still,
this is my whole future.

05:27.127 --> 05:29.061
Okay, fine.
I'll back down.

05:29.063 --> 05:30.295
But only 'cause
you're my sister

05:30.297 --> 05:33.031
and I love you,
so I'll let you have this one.

05:33.033 --> 05:34.633
And you lose, sucker!

05:34.835 --> 05:36.601
Adam, stop!
You stop!

05:36.603 --> 05:37.803
Stop!

05:38.172 --> 05:39.071
Okay, everyone,

05:39.073 --> 05:42.941
welcome to "The Day After"
emergency assembly.

05:42.943 --> 05:45.410
First of all,
I just want to assure you

05:45.412 --> 05:47.179
that everything
is gonna be okay.

05:47.181 --> 05:48.280
It will not be okay!

05:48.282 --> 05:50.949
There's nowhere to hide
in a nuclear winter!
Whoa. (CHUCKLES)

05:50.951 --> 05:53.819
What Coach means is
that there could be
a nuclear winter,

05:53.821 --> 05:54.753
but it definitely
won't happen.

05:54.755 --> 05:58.557
Till it does.
Does not, because
it was just a movie.

05:58.559 --> 05:59.958
That will, for sure,
come true.

05:59.960 --> 06:01.393
Look, I know
a lot of you are scared

06:01.395 --> 06:04.229
that the President is gonna
snap, push a button,

06:04.231 --> 06:05.197
and incinerate us all,

06:05.199 --> 06:07.432
but I assure you,
it will not happen.

06:07.434 --> 06:10.369
When it does,
I'll be safe and snug

06:10.371 --> 06:11.169
in my fallout shelter

06:11.171 --> 06:15.240
while the rest of you mutants
scrounge for cockroaches.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.909
What, you got no argument
for that one?

06:17.911 --> 06:18.643
No, you're right.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.679
That movie has shaken me
to my core.

06:20.681 --> 06:21.713
I have so many regrets.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.482
You got about a week
to fix 'em, Andre.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.717
Well, let's start
with that one right there.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.452
My name is not Andre.

06:27.454 --> 06:28.720
I only said it was
in college

06:28.722 --> 06:31.556
to make myself seem
more interesting
to the ladies.

06:31.558 --> 06:34.025
Let it out!
My name is Jonathan!

06:34.027 --> 06:36.628
And I love you,
Lunch Lady Bernice!

06:36.630 --> 06:38.563
Are you out there?

06:39.566 --> 06:42.434
MR. GLASCOTT: You're probably
mashing potatoes.

06:43.137 --> 06:43.935
Oh, boy.

06:43.937 --> 06:45.971
Okay,
this day is a wash.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.540
Everybody go home
and hug your loved ones.

06:48.542 --> 06:50.075
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

06:50.077 --> 06:52.043
I know I should be happy
to have the day off,

06:52.045 --> 06:53.612
but I'm, like,
genuinely terrified.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.714
Me too.
I feel so helpless.

06:55.716 --> 06:57.015
LAINEY: I never even got
to party in Daytona.

06:57.017 --> 07:00.085
ADULT ADAM:
<i> While Barry was desperate</i>
<i> to survive nuclear war,</i>

07:00.087 --> 07:02.120
<i> I was using Mother's Day</i>
<i> as a weapon</i>

07:02.122 --> 07:03.455
<i> to get what I wanted.</i>

07:03.457 --> 07:06.191
Oh! (SOBBING)

07:06.193 --> 07:07.926
Did you like my movie,
Mama?

07:07.928 --> 07:11.430
I loved it so much,
I wanna crush
your little face!

07:11.432 --> 07:12.697
Apropos of nothing,

07:12.699 --> 07:15.400
can I ask you
a totally random question?

07:15.402 --> 07:16.301
Anything, sweetie.

07:16.303 --> 07:19.171
Well, I have
a really big favor to...

07:19.173 --> 07:19.971
ERICA: (LAUGHING) Mom!

07:19.973 --> 07:21.473
I got into Emory,
and I wanna go to Emory,

07:21.475 --> 07:23.175
so I need a check for Emory
so I can go to Emory.

07:23.177 --> 07:25.811
And Happy Mother's Day.
I love you, snuggle, snuggle!

07:25.813 --> 07:26.978
Aah! Oh, yes!

07:26.980 --> 07:28.814
My baby's going to college!

07:28.816 --> 07:31.950
What? No!
No, no, no, no.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.185
Adam, be happy
for your sister.

07:33.187 --> 07:35.287
This is a huge day.
No, no, no, no, no!

07:35.289 --> 07:37.889
Don't make it about me.
It's your day, Mommy.

07:37.891 --> 07:39.825
No! No, no, no, no, no, no!

07:39.827 --> 07:41.660
Emory may be
a thousand miles away,

07:41.662 --> 07:46.631
but with the love
of my children
and 20 flights a year,

07:46.633 --> 07:47.999
we will manage.

07:48.001 --> 07:48.633

07:48.635 --> 07:50.902
I'm gonna get

07:50.904 --> 07:51.636
Boop!
(LAUGHS)

07:51.638 --> 07:53.805
Um, Mama, know what else
is exciting?

07:53.807 --> 07:56.842
Jackie invited me
down the shore next weekend.

07:56.844 --> 07:57.542
Oh, no, no.

07:57.544 --> 07:59.010
Your sister is going
away to college.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.346
That's enough excitement
for one Mother's Day.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.548
But I made up
a whole tap routine

08:03.550 --> 08:06.818
celebrating my love for you
on this special day.

08:09.790 --> 08:10.388
Yeah!

08:10.390 --> 08:14.059
You love your little
baby boopie tapping
his piggy wiggies.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.899
(CHUCKLING) Oh, yeah.

08:20.901 --> 08:21.833
Happy Mother's Day.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.602

ALL: Sorry!

08:41.522 --> 08:44.556
...I know you're all worried
about a nuclear apocalypse

08:44.558 --> 08:46.157
after seeing
that scary movie on TV,

08:46.159 --> 08:48.927
but I want you to know
everything will be okay.

08:48.929 --> 08:50.729
I call it Barry's Bunker.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.831
Sadly, there's limited room
in the bunker,

08:52.833 --> 08:54.533
so some of you
will be left outside to melt

08:54.535 --> 08:56.835
or be eaten
by post-apocalyptic zombies.

08:56.837 --> 08:57.636
So, who goes and who stays?

08:57.638 --> 09:00.839
Obviously, you're in,
'cause you're my foxy lady,

09:00.841 --> 09:03.308
but the rest of you
much prove your worth.

09:03.310 --> 09:05.010
Geoff Schwartz,
what skills do you have?

09:05.012 --> 09:06.311
I know which berries
are poisonous,

09:06.313 --> 09:07.646
'cause I once ate
some bad ones.

09:07.648 --> 09:09.581
Super useful.
Next, Naked Rob.

09:09.583 --> 09:13.285
What skills do you have?
And don't say "being naked."

09:13.487 --> 09:13.885
Come back to me.

09:13.887 --> 09:17.556
Andy, clearly you're in,
'cause you have
tiny little fingers

09:17.558 --> 09:19.190
that are perfect
for shelling nuts.

09:19.192 --> 09:20.325
Plus, you can sleep
in a drawer.

09:20.327 --> 09:23.061
Very insulted, but
it's more important to live.

09:23.063 --> 09:25.564
Matt Bradley,
looks like you're in
serious trouble here.

09:25.566 --> 09:27.399
I was an Eagle Scout
and a lifeguard,

09:27.401 --> 09:28.733
and I learned
how to frame a house

09:28.735 --> 09:29.968
when I did
Habitat for Humanity.

09:29.970 --> 09:31.937
Fine, I guess
you could cook or something.

09:31.939 --> 09:33.738
Well!
I'm glad you're all here,

09:33.740 --> 09:37.075
'cause I have something
very important to tell you.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.510
Get out!
Don't worry, guys.

09:38.512 --> 09:40.178
We won't have to deal
with this joker

09:40.180 --> 09:42.280
when we're in our
titanium-reinforced bunker.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.215
You do know I raised myself
since I was six,

09:44.217 --> 09:47.185
so if there's
an end-of-the-world situation,

09:47.187 --> 09:48.987
you'd want me there
real bad.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.957
Yelling at a sandwich for
having too much mustard on it

09:51.959 --> 09:52.891
is not a skill.

09:52.893 --> 09:54.025
Well, I can repair a radio,

09:54.027 --> 09:55.860
rebuild an engine,
swing a hammer,

09:55.862 --> 09:58.730
catch a fish, start a fire
with small sticks.

09:58.732 --> 09:59.264
What can you do?

09:59.266 --> 10:03.168
I can basically do anything.
I can break-dance,

10:03.403 --> 10:05.704
kick a light switch
on and off,

10:05.706 --> 10:07.472
use a hockey stick
as an old-timey cane.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.040
Sweetie, those aren't
really survival skills

10:09.042 --> 10:11.810
as much as they are adorable
things I love about you.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.012
Whatever.
I'm your leader.

10:14.014 --> 10:14.679
That's my skill.

10:14.681 --> 10:16.448
It kind of seems like
your dad's our leader,

10:16.450 --> 10:18.049
'cause he's
the oldest and wisest

10:18.051 --> 10:19.184
and actually knows
how to survive.

10:19.186 --> 10:21.019
It's settled.
Your dad will keep us safe

10:21.021 --> 10:22.420

attack.

10:22.422 --> 10:23.254
Okay.
Fine!

10:23.256 --> 10:25.457
I don't need you
or food or water.

It's a little early

10:45.812 --> 10:47.178
wouldn't you say?
Well, before you know it,

10:47.180 --> 10:49.748
she'll be gone to college and
only coming home on holidays.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.583
I guess that's true.
And then, junior year,

10:51.585 --> 10:53.885
she'll fall for
a handsome Southern fella

10:53.887 --> 10:54.586
and get married,

10:54.588 --> 10:56.354
and then she'll see
his family for the holidays.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.789
But then
I won't see her at all.

11:00.794 --> 11:02.527
and then travel gets
too hard with the twins.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.829
Well, the twins
are as much mine
as they are hers.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.532
She's gotta visit!
She has no time.

11:07.534 --> 11:08.333
The twins are in school,

11:08.335 --> 11:10.969
and Erica got a job
working the front office there

11:10.971 --> 11:12.537
and it's way too consuming.

out of the mail.

lost a sister.

Uh, what was that?

15:29.229 --> 15:31.029
They're little

15:31.798 --> 15:33.531
No, I know what Teddy Grahams
are, Adam.

15:33.533 --> 15:34.299
I meant with your sister.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.001
I kinda made a video
that ruined college for her

15:37.003 --> 15:38.569
so we could hit the beach.

15:38.571 --> 15:40.171
Anyway, does it get cold
at night?

15:40.173 --> 15:42.540
Should I bring a jacket?
Um, that's horrible.

15:42.542 --> 15:43.975
Yeah, it doesn't sound
that great

15:43.977 --> 15:44.642
when I hear it out loud.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.511
Maybe a windbreaker,
'cause the ocean breeze.

15:46.513 --> 15:50.782

that I do my own thing
for a while.

I said no!

17:11.164 --> 17:12.764

I lied about that, too.
