Okay folks, this is it. Haley James steps to the line with a flawless 4.0 GPA hanging in the balance.

02:07.348 --> 02:10.047
She’s going to need this free throw to pass Phys-Ed.

02:10.139 --> 02:13.557
Otherwise, her perfect grade point average is history.

02:15.007 --> 02:16.125
Come on, Hales. You can do it.

02:16.237 --> 02:17.956
Don’t miss it, tutor girl.

02:38.448 --> 02:39.459
Peyton.

02:40.499 --> 02:42.760
So, how’s everything with your dad?

02:42.909 --> 02:44.691
- It’s fine, thanks.
- Yeah.

02:46.652 --> 02:51.066
And... how about with us?

02:52.279 --> 02:53.641
Moment of weakness, right?

02:54.880 --> 02:57.502
- I’ve been feeling guilty about it all weekend.
- Me too.

02:59.244 --> 03:01.730
Listen, lets just bury it and pretend it didn’t happen, okay?

03:02.664 --> 03:03.476
Sure.

03:05.918 --> 03:09.703
Hi friend! Girl. Boy. What’s the latest scandal?

03:11.014 --> 03:14.909
You two never have any good gossip. Are we still redoing your bedroom tonight?

03:14.976 --> 03:16.466
- Yes.
- Terrific.

03:16.681 --> 03:18.826
- You up for some heavy lifting?
- Well, I…

03:18.878 --> 03:21.955
- …Would love to help?
- Yeah.

03:22.303 --> 03:26.266
You, me and broody in your bedroom all night. The web cam pervs are gonna love it.

03:28.323 --> 03:32.016
Dan has a son from a previous relationship. Lucas.

03:32.113 --> 03:35.015
She’s know about this kid for years and all of a sudden it’s grounds for separation?

03:35.066 --> 03:39.000
He joined Nathan’s basketball team. That’s when things got worse.

03:39.056 --> 03:42.143
Dan as I recall you chose not to be a part of Lucas’ life.

03:43.378 --> 03:46.434
Richmond University. Wow.

03:46.874 --> 03:50.550
Not exactly the end all and be all to psychology degrees. Am I right, doc?

03:52.285 --> 03:53.945
We were talking about Lucas.

03:54.005 --> 03:57.692
Hey doc, did you ever read that article about the mountain climber who had his arm wedged beneath a boulder?

03:58.849 --> 04:01.635
His arm was caught beneath a thousand pound rock.

04:01.687 --> 04:04.692
So he cut it off just below the elbow using nothing but a pocket knife.

04:06.116 --> 04:09.121
Of course he had to break the bone first.

04:09.422 --> 04:11.137
Some people find that hard to believe.

04:12.772 --> 04:14.077
But it’s simple really.

04:14.794 --> 04:18.495
He found himself faced with a difficult situation, he did what he had to do to survive.

04:19.821 --> 04:21.004
I made a choice.

04:22.099 --> 04:24.055
To cut away the part of me that he me trapped.

04:24.266 --> 04:26.226
You can question my judgment if you want to.

04:26.580 --> 04:30.072
The fact of the matter is, you can never really understand it,

04:30.441 --> 04:32.345
until it’s you that’s caught beneath the weight.

04:34.572 --> 04:36.421
And was I a weight too?

04:37.428 --> 04:40.061
Because I got pregnant shortly after Karen.

04:41.141 --> 04:43.600
How do you explain being with me and not her?

04:46.517 --> 04:48.284
Because with you I saw a future.

05:17.749 --> 05:18.728
Hey, Peyton.

05:20.174 --> 05:24.170
Oh, hey Brooke had to take off early so she said for you to call her.

05:24.709 --> 05:25.512
Okay.

05:26.607 --> 05:27.540
You got a sec?

05:28.506 --> 05:30.622
Uh, yeah. What’s up?

05:31.502 --> 05:32.481
I lied.

05:33.536 --> 05:35.921
Okay, I can’t bury what happened between us.

05:36.075 --> 05:39.546
Lucas, Brooke is my best friend. And she’s your girlfriend.

05:39.608 --> 05:43.295
- I know. But…
- But nothing. Okay?

05:43.681 --> 05:45.091
That’s where we’re at right now.

05:46.679 --> 05:49.438
It’s not fair to her to make a big deal out of what happened.

05:49.665 --> 05:50.795
It didn’t mean anything.

05:52.714 --> 05:54.348
- I’m sorry.
- Peyton.

06:06.979 --> 06:10.641
See? It does mean something.

06:12.484 --> 06:14.347
- It can’t.
- But it does.

06:14.773 --> 06:19.950
- Lucas, you’re dating Brooke.
- I know. And she’s great. Okay?

06:20.001 --> 06:22.874
But, she’s not you.

06:23.856 --> 06:28.325
Look, ever since you came to my room and you told me how you felt about me

06:28.741 --> 06:30.255
I’ve been hiding with Brooke.

06:31.725 --> 06:34.491
Okay? I’ve been trying not to get hurt again.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.133
I don’t want to hide anymore.

06:41.033 --> 06:43.726
Even if we could be together, what makes you think it would work?

06:46.527 --> 06:51.181
Cause I feel it in my heart. Don’t you?

06:52.681 --> 06:53.450
Yes.

06:56.795 --> 06:58.155
So what are we going to do?

07:13.006 --> 07:14.293
What’s up, loser?

07:14.406 --> 07:19.372
Hey, you. I’m just finishing up this email to my mom cause she comes back tomorrow.

07:19.433 --> 07:21.721
Oh cool. Tell her I said ’Hi’.

07:22.669 --> 07:24.451
You’re going to call me when she gets back from the airport, right?

07:24.600 --> 07:25.316
Oh yeah.

07:25.879 --> 07:26.510
Cool.

07:27.139 --> 07:32.532
So, I need to borrow a couple of things from you, like your basketball and you.

07:35.271 --> 07:36.459
Okay, why?

07:36.621 --> 07:41.879
Because I’m totally flagging PE and I need you to show me how to throw a stinking free shot.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.771
- Free throw.
- Whatever

07:47.704 --> 07:52.069
You know I’d love to, Hales, but I’ve got to do some stuff with Brooke and Peyton tonight.

07:52.396 --> 07:53.365
Like what?

07:53.862 --> 07:55.663
I kind of need to talk to you about something.

07:56.014 --> 07:56.902
What’s going on?

07:58.924 --> 08:01.541
- Hey, tutor girl.
- Tiger, what’s up?

08:02.283 --> 08:04.164
Never mind. Rain check?

08:05.884 --> 08:07.496
You kids have fun.

08:10.045 --> 08:10.973
You ready to go?

08:11.760 --> 08:14.602
Yeah, sure.

08:15.554 --> 08:16.999
Then lets go, boyfriend.

08:22.313 --> 08:23.546
What’s the good word, coach?

08:24.535 --> 08:25.922
There is no good word.

08:27.187 --> 08:28.708
What brings you around here?

08:29.584 --> 08:34.631
Oh, a little victory celebration.

08:35.140 --> 08:36.270
What’s the occasion?

08:37.845 --> 08:40.607
I thought you might want to toast your 500th win.

08:41.871 --> 08:46.217
499. I haven’t made it yet.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.238
Yeah, well I’m beating the rush.

08:48.635 --> 08:52.440
Well, I guess this could serve as a dual toast.

08:53.949 --> 08:55.306
Why’s that?

08:55.625 --> 08:57.534
I’m thinking of stepping down.

08:59.438 --> 09:01.907
That come as a big surprise to you, Keith?

09:01.962 --> 09:04.518
Well yeah. Yeah, it does.

09:05.668 --> 09:07.799
A fellow can’t coach forever.

09:09.309 --> 09:13.002
Well, he can’t quit while he still loves the game.

09:14.906 --> 09:16.370
Who says I love it?

09:17.235 --> 09:21.070
You do. Every time you step out onto that court.

09:22.483 --> 09:24.393
This game is what keeps you young.

09:24.690 --> 09:29.934
Without it you’d... I don’t know you’d be off somewhere babbling, wearing a dress.

09:30.662 --> 09:32.392
You haven’t seen me at home.

09:35.746 --> 09:39.349
I promised myself I’d coach for 20 years,

09:39.718 --> 09:42.979
then Camilla and I would start living.

09:44.644 --> 09:49.375
35 years later, here I am.

09:59.913 --> 10:01.222
Was that your jump shot?

10:01.898 --> 10:04.918
Cause if that was your jump shot, I can’t date you anymore.

10:06.007 --> 10:08.718
My mom said you’d be here. Something about a grade?

10:08.943 --> 10:10.730
Yeah. You cannot be here right now.

10:10.899 --> 10:13.305
- Why not?
- Because I look stupid.

10:13.574 --> 10:17.581
You realize I’ve seen you in that crocheted poncho thing you wear, right?

10:18.885 --> 10:24.314
Come on this is embarrassing! I want you to think I’m… not embarrassing.

10:24.626 --> 10:26.158
You don’t embarrass me, Haley.

10:26.531 --> 10:27.838
Oh yeah? Okay.

10:32.435 --> 10:34.355
Okay, I take that back.

10:34.416 --> 10:36.608
- I can’t do it.
- Yes you can. Just...

10:36.875 --> 10:39.796
Alright, square your shoulders, to the basket.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.827
And you’ve got to bring the ball up right past your nose like this. Okay?

10:44.379 --> 10:45.363
Bend your knees a little.

10:47.287 --> 10:48.839
Relax your hips.

10:50.636 --> 10:51.584
And just shoot.

10:54.999 --> 10:58.735
Okay, that wasn’t perfect but it also wasn’t embarrassing.

10:59.199 --> 11:00.664
It was actually kind of sexy.

11:08.248 --> 11:09.575
- Come again.
- Thanks.

11:11.660 --> 11:14.029
I got to hand it to you, Deb. You’ve done one hell of a job here.

11:14.515 --> 11:15.346
Thanks, Keith.

11:16.267 --> 11:18.494
So I hope you don’t take this the wrong way,

11:18.545 --> 11:22.089
but I’m just really excited about Karen coming back.

11:22.318 --> 11:23.989
Yeah, so am I.

11:24.706 --> 11:27.629
If you don’t mind me asking, how are things with you and Dan?

11:29.052 --> 11:34.910
Oh, I don’t know. We’re going to therapy but I’m not sure we can find our way back.

11:35.739 --> 11:36.605
To where?

11:37.326 --> 11:38.678
The people we used to be.

11:39.499 --> 11:43.317
We used to laugh more. We were kind to each other.

11:44.228 --> 11:45.467
We were in love.

11:46.296 --> 11:47.392
What about now?

11:48.704 --> 11:50.055
I honestly don’t know.

11:53.347 --> 11:54.335
A little help!

11:57.796 --> 11:58.755
Thanks.

11:59.171 --> 12:00.086
My pleasure.

12:01.836 --> 12:03.415
- I’m Carrie.
- Dan.

12:04.042 --> 12:06.665
Dan. I was wondering what the name of the attractive man

12:06.709 --> 12:08.675
who jogs past my bungalow every morning was.

12:08.738 --> 12:10.627
Yeah? What was it?

12:12.491 --> 12:14.380
So what are you doing on my beach, Carrie?

12:14.831 --> 12:16.592
I heard it’s a great place to pick up guys.

12:17.033 --> 12:18.169
Only the light ones.

12:20.596 --> 12:23.275
Well, it was a pleasure meeting you.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.290
Even with the ugly hat.

12:27.687 --> 12:28.588
Um, Dan.

12:30.852 --> 12:32.101
The yellow cottage is mine.

12:33.094 --> 12:34.589
Come by and see me sometime.

12:49.708 --> 12:51.628
Hey girly, lets do some damage.

12:55.459 --> 12:56.753
- We’re going to hell.
- Peyton.

12:56.805 --> 12:59.258
No honestly, we are horrible, rotten people.

13:00.098 --> 13:01.808
Come on you two, lets go!

13:02.755 --> 13:06.687
- Lucas, I don’t want to hurt her.
- Neither do I. Okay? But we’ve got to tell her.

13:09.207 --> 13:10.037
Tonight.

13:12.765 --> 13:13.733
Lets go!

13:29.280 --> 13:31.063
Okay, broody show us what you’ve got.

13:41.028 --> 13:43.606
Want to hear a secret? I know you do.

13:44.389 --> 13:45.056
Brooke…

13:45.142 --> 13:48.296
I’m falling for him. Big time.

13:49.166 --> 13:51.374
Speechless right? I know, it’s crazy but...

13:51.604 --> 13:56.232
this is like L-O-V-E mad crushed out, I’m in big trouble.

13:57.538 --> 14:01.582
- That’s…
- What is this? On the stereo.

14:01.838 --> 14:05.326
- It’s Tegan and Sara.
- I know that. But what song?

14:07.108 --> 14:08.234
Don’t confess.

14:11.291 --> 14:14.553
Um, you know what? I totally flaked. I forgot paint brushes.

14:14.656 --> 14:15.637
Well, we could finger paint.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.858
No, really. Maybe we should just do this another time.

14:19.083 --> 14:21.111
I’m kind of not feeling well right now.

14:21.910 --> 14:26.302
Really, you guys should go. Okay? Cause I’m going to launch any second now.

14:26.395 --> 14:29.446
Well how about we do it tomorrow night, after Lucas’ mom gets back.

14:29.493 --> 14:31.499
Fine, tomorrow night.

14:33.435 --> 14:34.182
Okay.

14:34.668 --> 14:36.293
Come on, I’ll let you buy me hot chocolate.

14:36.879 --> 14:39.779
And P. Sawyer, please don’t hurl too much.

14:39.886 --> 14:42.716
Because if you get any thinner, I’m gonna start looking fat.

14:46.748 --> 14:48.292
I cant do this to her.

14:56.704 --> 14:58.707
Have I told you lately how much I like you?

15:00.980 --> 15:01.881
Why?

15:02.196 --> 15:03.454
Why do I tell you?

15:04.682 --> 15:06.474
No, why do you like me?

15:07.197 --> 15:09.516
Hmm, pity mostly.

15:12.055 --> 15:13.545
How come you’re so quiet tonight?

15:14.692 --> 15:17.846
I’m just anxious about my mom coming back tomorrow.

15:18.190 --> 15:19.249
Yeah, me too.

15:20.677 --> 15:21.533
Why are you?

15:22.351 --> 15:23.877
Cause I want her to like me.

15:25.127 --> 15:29.396
Plus she sounds really cool, and I’m not that close with my mom so...

15:29.683 --> 15:31.982
I just think it’d be great if I hit it off with yours.

15:36.298 --> 15:37.815
You can’t control love, you know?

15:40.215 --> 15:42.023
Your mom and Keith.

15:42.964 --> 15:45.069
You’re worried about their relationship, right?

15:46.165 --> 15:47.025
Right.

15:48.495 --> 15:49.606
They’ll be okay.

15:51.200 --> 15:55.165
People that are meant to be together always find their way in the end.

16:18.280 --> 16:19.988
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:20.054 --> 16:22.020
- I was hoping you’d be here.
- What’s up?

16:23.781 --> 16:29.399
Um, I actually need some advice, and I didn’t have anybody to talk to.

16:29.588 --> 16:33.837
Brooke’s not around? Sorry. Where’s the rest of your minions?

16:34.230 --> 16:35.159
What Minions?

16:35.313 --> 16:36.710
You’re like the queen of the hive.

16:37.939 --> 16:43.069
I guess I have a lot of friends, but I don’t really have any I can talk to.

16:43.775 --> 16:47.835
Okay, um, lets just go over…

16:48.471 --> 16:50.227
So what’s on your mind?

16:51.194 --> 16:51.901
Um...

16:54.168 --> 16:59.033
you know when you first realized that you liked Nathan, and you knew that Lucas would flip out?

16:59.796 --> 17:00.871
How’d you deal with that?

17:01.369 --> 17:03.324
Why? What’s going on?

17:03.590 --> 17:05.162
It’s just friend of a friend stuff.

17:06.098 --> 17:07.752
Okay, um...

17:08.977 --> 17:15.040
I sort of asked myself, repeatedly, if this thing with Nathan is really worth losing my best friend over.

17:15.914 --> 17:16.579
Yeah.

17:16.784 --> 17:20.501
Look, if Lucas is really my best friend, then he should just be happy for me.

17:20.977 --> 17:22.422
It’s not like he was dating Nathan.

17:25.521 --> 17:27.167
Are you sure you’re okay?

17:27.588 --> 17:30.209
- I’m good. Thanks Haley.
- Sure.

17:35.521 --> 17:43.245
Coach for 20 years, Win 500 games, Make a difference.

17:47.807 --> 17:48.538
Yeah.

17:49.056 --> 17:50.008
You wanted to see me?

17:52.501 --> 17:55.926
That was an interesting meal the other night, wasn’t it?

17:56.517 --> 17:57.217
Yeah.

18:00.744 --> 18:02.443
Tell me something, Nathan.

18:03.837 --> 18:05.645
Have I made a difference to you?

18:06.459 --> 18:07.350
What do you mean?

18:07.448 --> 18:13.212
I mean being on this team, me rattling on all the time, have you learned anything?

18:14.706 --> 18:16.924
I move my feet better on defense.

18:21.926 --> 18:23.856
Well, that’s something, I guess.

18:28.696 --> 18:32.684
There’s a couple of new plays in that folder that you missed out on.

18:42.776 --> 18:48.280
Coach, I just wanted to say thanks. For letting me back on the team.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.302
Today’s the day, I still suck.

19:03.363 --> 19:05.125
Come on, it’s alright. Just keep your elbows in.

19:08.447 --> 19:09.267
What’s this?

19:11.185 --> 19:14.345
Hey, dad. I’m just giving Haley a few pointers.

19:14.417 --> 19:15.114
I’ll bet.

19:15.804 --> 19:17.710
- Haley.
- Mr. Scott.

19:18.140 --> 19:21.807
So Nathan, I thought we’d grill up some steaks at the beach house for dinner. Just the two of us.

19:22.098 --> 19:27.151
That sounds great, Dad. But... Haley and I have plans tonight.

19:29.114 --> 19:29.926
Okay.

19:30.981 --> 19:32.030
Some other time, huh?

19:32.419 --> 19:37.041
Sure. I heard you were back on the team. I think that’s a good move.

19:37.123 --> 19:37.821
Yeah.

19:41.006 --> 19:42.030
How’s my house?

19:48.255 --> 19:51.174
I’m sorry. You should go with your dad tonight, if you want.

19:51.274 --> 19:54.004
I don’t want to go with my dad. I want to be with you.

19:54.384 --> 19:56.335
Now knock down this shot like I know you can.

20:03.201 --> 20:06.468
It’s okay. This calls for drastic measures.

20:08.245 --> 20:10.635
You’re going to be fine. Try it granny style.

21:27.104 --> 21:30.064
Hey. I so owe you.

21:30.883 --> 21:32.741
Good, cause I need a favor.

21:42.107 --> 21:42.760
Hey.

21:45.689 --> 21:49.352
I just came by to check on you.

21:50.071 --> 21:52.591
You know, considering the throw down with mom and dad and everything.

21:53.036 --> 21:54.772
Oh, so now you’re concerned about me.

21:55.203 --> 21:57.757
After bringing Whitey to my house last week to antagonize me.

21:58.591 --> 21:59.626
I didn’t think it would hurt.

21:59.682 --> 22:01.695
No, Keith, you knew it would. That’s why you did it.

22:02.227 --> 22:05.933
Okay whatever, Danny, look I just came by to see how you were doing. My mistake.

22:06.185 --> 22:07.731
Yet another one by you.

22:09.523 --> 22:11.652
You know, it’s no wonder you’re all alone out here.

22:11.719 --> 22:13.972
You’re right, Keith, I am alone. Now.

22:14.284 --> 22:18.165
But you’re alone period. You want to know why? Because you’re malicious.

22:18.237 --> 22:19.215
I’m malicious?

22:19.523 --> 22:22.522
You bring Whitey to my house, you put Lucas on the basketball team,

22:22.788 --> 22:26.496
so its no wonder I’m out here by myself. It’s almost as if you planed it that way.

22:26.742 --> 22:30.452
Easy on the conspiracy theories, Danny. Maybe you want to take a look in the mirror.

22:32.937 --> 22:34.478
Oh so where are you running off to now?

22:38.025 --> 22:38.814
The airport.

22:39.096 --> 22:43.398
Right, still living that lie huh? Unless of course you and Karen are a couple.

22:43.535 --> 22:45.767
As a matter of fact, after tonight, we will be.

22:45.839 --> 22:49.490
Wow. High School fantasies really do come true.

22:49.761 --> 22:53.043
Well, you always had a thing for her. Even when I was with her.

22:53.714 --> 22:56.412
But you should ask yourself one question, Keith.

22:57.584 --> 23:02.080
If you weren’t good enough for her then, what makes you think you’ll be good enough for her now?

23:18.254 --> 23:19.391
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:19.749 --> 23:21.838
- 3 hours till Karen.
- Yep.

23:23.508 --> 23:25.586
So ask me what mistake I just made.

23:26.876 --> 23:28.561
What mistake did you just make?

23:28.709 --> 23:31.254
I... just went to see Dan.

23:32.252 --> 23:33.242
Why?

23:34.142 --> 23:35.233
I don’t know. Brotherly Love.

23:35.591 --> 23:40.664
I thought maybe he could use someone to talk to, but he’s in a really dark place right now.

23:41.181 --> 23:43.869
I’m sorry, he doesn’t do well alone.

23:44.117 --> 23:48.687
Well sure. No one to tear down when he’s alone. Except himself.

23:50.214 --> 23:51.075
You hungry?

23:51.647 --> 23:54.038
Oh no. But I could use a beer.

23:54.479 --> 23:55.764
3 hours to Karen?

23:56.350 --> 24:00.149
I know. That’s why I could use a breezer.

24:02.660 --> 24:04.396
I never told you this but...

24:05.477 --> 24:09.705
before she left, she kissed me in the airport.

24:09.818 --> 24:12.998
And it wasn’t just one of those, you know, see you later kind of kisses.

24:13.464 --> 24:15.256
Keith, that’s great.

24:15.337 --> 24:19.843
Yeah it is. It’s funny, I feel like I’m about to start the life that I always wanted.

24:21.031 --> 24:23.878
It’s 3 hours away. I’m scared as hell.

24:24.671 --> 24:26.741
Well, it couldn’t happen to two better people.

24:27.263 --> 24:27.903
Thanks.

24:28.373 --> 24:29.300
You’re going to be fine.

24:35.585 --> 24:36.765
Dan. Dan.

24:38.035 --> 24:39.080
You disappoint me.

24:39.522 --> 24:40.595
How’s that, Carrie?

24:40.666 --> 24:42.392
You don’t call, You don’t write.

24:42.772 --> 24:46.483
And when I come over to invite you to dinner, you start without me.

24:52.131 --> 24:55.868
Actually you’re right on time. Would you care to join me?

24:56.493 --> 24:57.757
I’d like that.

25:03.446 --> 25:07.666
Hey, did you know that Whitey’s real name is Brian?

25:08.376 --> 25:09.493
Brian Durham?

25:09.647 --> 25:10.435
Yeah!

25:10.768 --> 25:11.572
Who knew?

25:12.111 --> 25:15.100
Come here, this is great. This site’s got his whole record before Tree Hill.

25:15.468 --> 25:16.374
That’s perfect.

25:18.872 --> 25:20.650
I’m gonna go get something to drink, do you want anything?

25:20.716 --> 25:21.790
No I’m fine, thanks.

25:31.730 --> 25:35.447
This is so wrong. Sneaking around behind Brooke.

25:38.537 --> 25:39.747
Do you think that’s part of it?

25:40.270 --> 25:41.171
Part of what?

25:42.590 --> 25:46.704
Us. You know, that this is wrong.

25:47.263 --> 25:50.403
Somehow it makes it feel deeper.

25:51.560 --> 25:54.975
Lucas, Brooke and I have been best friends since elementary school.

25:55.326 --> 25:58.266
We’ve always put our friendship before guys.

25:59.485 --> 26:02.609
Do you really think I’d risk losing my best friend over a fling?

26:02.655 --> 26:04.969
Cause I wouldn’t do that.

26:07.021 --> 26:07.852
Okay.

26:10.498 --> 26:11.856
Look, I don’t want to hurt Brooke.

26:12.587 --> 26:15.229
And I don’t want to come between the two of you. But...

26:17.927 --> 26:19.341
I have to be with you.

26:38.649 --> 26:40.081
Would you like something to drink, Carrie?

26:41.853 --> 26:43.251
How's your red wine selection?

26:44.454 --> 26:45.370
Excellent.

26:51.356 --> 26:52.365
Do you need a hand?

26:52.666 --> 26:54.446
No, I’m just looking for a cork screw.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.455
Well, you better find one or you’ll never get me drunk.

27:08.170 --> 27:09.068
Dan?

27:11.908 --> 27:12.715
I’m sorry.

27:14.724 --> 27:16.388
I’m sure you’re a great person, Carrie.

27:17.862 --> 27:19.885
But I have a wife I love very much.

27:21.734 --> 27:24.473
That’s sweet, but also a coincidence.

27:25.210 --> 27:28.041
Since I have a husband I love very much.

27:30.561 --> 27:32.834
But then again, our spouses aren’t here, are they?

27:37.544 --> 27:39.098
Or maybe one of them is.

27:43.432 --> 27:46.749
I guess I’ll go.

27:50.099 --> 27:51.127
Deb...

27:57.359 --> 27:58.814
Hey, we’re just about to pick up my mom.

28:00.324 --> 28:01.910
What is going on with you and Peyton?

28:02.871 --> 28:03.743
Nothing.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.515
So you guys weren’t together recently?

28:05.592 --> 28:08.494
No. Why? What’d you talk to Peyton?

28:08.588 --> 28:10.840
Why? Are you trying to figure out what lie to tell me next?

28:13.775 --> 28:16.011
- I wanted to tell you, Hales.
- Tell me what?

28:16.156 --> 28:18.213
- That we’ve been…
- Yeah, I know you’ve been

28:18.264 --> 28:22.063
cause I saw you kissing her which is a really jack ass move considering you have a girlfriend named Brooke.

28:22.135 --> 28:24.300
Don’t lecture me, Haley. I know that.

28:24.358 --> 28:26.835
- So stop it.
- I can’t. It’s complicated.

28:26.911 --> 28:29.616
It’s not complicated, it’s simple. It’s really simple.

28:29.693 --> 28:33.579
What you’re doing is wrong. And if you can’t see that, I don’t like the person you’re becoming.

28:33.645 --> 28:36.297
Okay, the person I’m becoming? What about the person you’re becoming?

28:36.358 --> 28:38.473
- What does that mean?
- You know what it means, Haley.

28:39.544 --> 28:43.092
Nathan says a few nice things to you to get back at me and you fall for it.

28:43.153 --> 28:46.542
Oh my God! If I hear that one more time. You know that I did that for you.

28:46.614 --> 28:47.837
- You did it for me?!
- Yeah.

28:47.905 --> 28:50.218
Okay, is that what you tell yourself every time you’re kissing him?

28:50.295 --> 28:53.874
That you’re doing it for me? You’re the one that’s lying.

28:53.942 --> 28:56.412
Alright, if you’re looking for betrayal, look to yourself.

28:56.582 --> 28:59.885
You know what, Luke? Next time you see me, don’t talk to me.

28:59.957 --> 29:00.674
Fine!

29:00.848 --> 29:01.483
Fine!

29:06.187 --> 29:11.833
It was completely innocent. She has a beach house. I had an extra steak.

29:12.266 --> 29:14.043
And a bottle of wine.

29:15.978 --> 29:17.735
Deb, I was lonely for some company.

29:20.699 --> 29:25.978
I’m lonely too, Dan. But I’m not off frolicking with the pool boy.

29:26.213 --> 29:29.561
Conversation, Deb. Remember? Like we used to have?

29:29.639 --> 29:33.995
Okay, so it’s my fault? My deficiencies as a conversationalist

29:34.052 --> 29:36.765
have driven you to dine with beach whores.

29:39.218 --> 29:40.128
Are you hungry?

29:42.516 --> 29:45.521
Oh Deb, please. Deb. Deb, don’t go.

29:45.926 --> 29:49.003
Deb, wait. Look. Look at this.

29:53.647 --> 29:55.161
Those two people were happy.

29:56.011 --> 29:57.214
They loved each other.

29:59.642 --> 30:02.176
The hurricane that fall washed half the beach away.

30:04.393 --> 30:05.345
Yeah.

30:07.349 --> 30:09.288
And took those people with it.

30:14.149 --> 30:15.437
Deb, don’t go.

30:23.146 --> 30:24.228
I love you.

30:38.237 --> 30:39.537
So you’re just going to quit, huh?

30:40.901 --> 30:42.829
Win 500 games and walk away?

30:45.185 --> 30:46.772
I did a little research in the library.

30:47.397 --> 30:48.773
You were in the library?

30:51.303 --> 30:53.575
Temperature must have dropped in hell.

30:56.899 --> 31:02.095
I promised Camilla I’d win 500 games then walk away.

31:03.591 --> 31:05.394
We were going to grow old together.

31:05.563 --> 31:06.914
You’re already old, coach.

31:07.999 --> 31:09.750
Besides, who’s going to yell at me, huh?

31:10.538 --> 31:13.872
I’m not supposed to yell at you, Nathan, you’re supposed to learn things.

31:13.934 --> 31:16.520
Yeah but what fun would that be? You love yelling at me.

31:16.585 --> 31:17.993
- I do not!
- Yes, you do.

31:18.055 --> 31:20.057
You love to yell at me and I love to make you yell.

31:20.119 --> 31:22.730
Well, if you’d listen once and a while you knucklehead!

31:26.867 --> 31:29.503
You know not many coaches win 500 games.

31:29.673 --> 31:33.697
No not many high school coaches win 500 games, you know why?

31:33.756 --> 31:36.077
Cause they move up to the next level.

31:36.128 --> 31:42.831
To carpeted locker rooms and air-conditioned buses, and games that matter.

31:44.704 --> 31:48.119
That’s a bunch of crap, coach. And you know it.

31:48.730 --> 31:50.363
These are the games that matter.

31:51.202 --> 31:54.050
They matter to kids who are just trying to figure themselves out.

31:55.017 --> 31:56.374
Figure out who they’re going to be.

31:57.761 --> 32:02.712
Look, the other day, you asked me if you’ve made a difference.

32:04.279 --> 32:05.217
Well, you have.

32:08.324 --> 32:09.290
At least with me.

32:15.072 --> 32:15.856
Son.

32:19.696 --> 32:23.771
At some point, you’ve got to do it on your own.

32:24.672 --> 32:25.932
Yeah, at some point.

32:27.928 --> 32:30.356
We both know I’ve got a long way to go, coach.

32:34.790 --> 32:36.177
Just don’t give up on me.

32:51.563 --> 32:54.139
Hi it’s Deb, leave a message and I’ll get back to you.

32:55.965 --> 33:00.829
Deb, it’s me. I’m coming to see you.

33:34.975 --> 33:38.402
It’s like they’re all judging you. You can’t hide in here anymore.

33:40.316 --> 33:41.867
Well, Lucas should be here soon.

33:46.403 --> 33:47.796
Brooke, you’re my best friend.

33:51.123 --> 33:52.849
- So…
- No, I mean it.

33:53.997 --> 33:55.742
You’re my best friend, you know that, right?

33:56.750 --> 34:01.057
Yeah, crazy. What drugs are you on and can I have some?

34:03.509 --> 34:04.963
I need to tell you something....

34:06.023 --> 34:06.863
What’s wrong?

34:07.866 --> 34:09.781
I had a little disagreement with Lucas.

34:10.656 --> 34:12.123
- About me?
- No...

34:13.553 --> 34:16.945
just the way he’s been acting, he’s really disappointing me.

34:19.389 --> 34:20.297
What?

34:20.985 --> 34:23.954
Nothing, it’s just kind of ironic.

34:24.902 --> 34:25.940
What’s ironic?

34:26.083 --> 34:27.342
Lucas, being a jerk.

34:28.793 --> 34:31.868
How is that… how is that ironic?

34:32.156 --> 34:34.409
Well, cause that used to be my role, right?

34:34.686 --> 34:37.359
I mean this whole thing started cause I was just trying to mess with Lucas.

34:37.864 --> 34:39.652
It’s just kind of weird, that’s all.

35:03.455 --> 35:06.828
- I need to come home.
- No. No.

35:07.704 --> 35:10.219
- Deb…
- Don’t, Dan.

35:11.012 --> 35:12.707
There’s nothing you can say anymore.

35:15.529 --> 35:16.926
I want a divorce.

35:23.899 --> 35:25.240
So you excited to see your mom?

35:26.890 --> 35:27.770
Yeah.

35:28.363 --> 35:31.044
It seems like just yesterday I was kissing her goodbye at the airport.

35:31.109 --> 35:32.604
Wait, you were kissing my mother?

35:32.695 --> 35:34.063
Yeah, saying goodbye.

35:34.789 --> 35:39.219
Okay, Keith could you just do me a favor and keep the PDA to a minimum.

35:43.432 --> 35:46.767
You think maybe you could keep that tattoo covered up for a while?

35:47.267 --> 35:49.884
Like, say, the rest of your life.

35:58.225 --> 36:02.111
Listen, Luke, I know it wasn’t always smooth sailing between us, but...

36:02.447 --> 36:05.802
whatever your mom wants us to be, I just want you to know that…

36:05.854 --> 36:06.904
I love you too, Keith.

36:31.357 --> 36:32.446
Keith!

36:34.559 --> 36:36.824
Easy, easy Keith I got you. Come on.

36:37.621 --> 36:38.903
Lucas. Get Lucas!

37:07.440 --> 37:08.482
Dan. Is Luke okay?

37:09.111 --> 37:10.699
He’s going to be okay, Keith.

37:44.229 --> 37:45.607
I need a doctor.

37:46.668 --> 37:48.280
My brother’s in the car, he needs some help.

37:48.373 --> 37:49.703
- What happened?
- Car Accident.

37:50.112 --> 37:52.749
He was on the passenger’s side. Nearest point of impact.

37:52.893 --> 37:55.260
Set up for a chest tube. Cross in time for 4 units.

37:55.412 --> 37:56.943
- He’s a minor?
- Yeah.

37:57.081 --> 37:59.421
- He’s going to need surgery.
- Do whatever you need to do, Doc.

37:59.513 --> 38:00.652
You’re his legal guardian?

38:03.911 --> 38:04.870
He’s my son.

38:26.195 --> 38:29.011
Well, you’ve got a concussion and I’m going to have to close that.

38:30.342 --> 38:31.703
But you’ll be fine.

38:32.456 --> 38:35.144
So, how much have you had to drink today?

39:11.702 --> 39:15.629
Paging Karen Roe. Karen Roe to the nearest white courtesy phone.

39:24.680 --> 39:25.960
This is Karen Roe.
