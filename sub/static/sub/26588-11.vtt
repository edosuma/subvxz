00:01.710 --> 00:03.250
Dre: Parenting.

00:03.250 --> 00:05.420
Some people think
you've got to read books

00:05.420 --> 00:07.670
or go to lectures
to be good at it.

00:07.670 --> 00:11.250
Those people like to waste
their time and money.

00:11.250 --> 00:14.500
See, Bow and I
have parenting down.

00:14.500 --> 00:17.040
For example,
Junior's supposed to be

00:17.040 --> 00:19.040
on this new track
of finding himself.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.670
The only thing he's found

00:20.670 --> 00:23.420
is how to run up
my daytime electric bill.

00:23.420 --> 00:25.420
So I'll laugh politely
and then say...

00:25.420 --> 00:26.580
Hey, Junior.

00:26.580 --> 00:29.040
In a month, I'm kicking you
out of my house.

00:29.040 --> 00:31.460
And Bow is doing her thing.

00:31.460 --> 00:34.420
This week, she pulled back
on the twins' screen time.

00:34.420 --> 00:35.960
And what happened?

00:35.960 --> 00:39.790
"All right. So they got A's
on their English test.

00:39.790 --> 00:44.580
Well, I mean, Jack got a C."
But for Jack, that's an A.

00:44.580 --> 00:46.080
Yep.

00:46.080 --> 00:48.080
We've got parenting on lock.

00:48.080 --> 00:49.960
We're ready for anything.

00:51.790 --> 00:53.210
Hey, June Bug.
What up, cuzzo?

00:53.210 --> 00:55.250
Hey, before you say anything,

00:55.250 --> 00:57.620
I do not want any more
Herbalife, okay?

00:57.620 --> 00:59.620
Because I am never
going to be a distributor.

00:59.620 --> 01:01.250
You see, that attitude
right there --

01:01.250 --> 01:02.750
that's why you got
the sugars right now.

01:02.750 --> 01:04.330
Actually,
it's about Kyra.

01:04.330 --> 01:05.920
It's your turn
to take her in.

01:05.920 --> 01:08.580
Wait, what?
Well, she'll be there tomorrow.

01:08.580 --> 01:10.920
I'm putting her in an Uber,
but my card might not work,

01:10.920 --> 01:12.420
so make sure you have
some cash on your side.

01:12.420 --> 01:14.960
H-Hey, but --
Going through a tunnel!

01:17.120 --> 01:19.120
June Bug.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.580
He's sending us
Kyra tomorrow.

01:22.580 --> 01:26.920
Please tell me that Kyra
is a new flavor of Herbalife.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.920
That would be too easy.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.750
So cousin Kyra's gonna come
stay with us.

01:35.750 --> 01:38.120
Mm-hmm.
When was the last time
we saw her?

01:38.120 --> 01:39.920
I don't know.
It's been years.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.080
Yeah, she's 16 now.
Whew.

01:41.080 --> 01:42.750
Been bouncing
from house to house

01:42.750 --> 01:43.920
ever since her mother
went to prison.

01:43.920 --> 01:46.170
Ugh, poor girl.
Yeah.

01:46.170 --> 01:48.790
I remember my mom went to
a silent yoga retreat

01:48.790 --> 01:51.880
for a weekend, and I was --
I was a mess.

01:51.880 --> 01:53.500
Oh, you get it.
Yes.

01:53.500 --> 01:54.830
Yeah, but when she gets here,
could you not talk to her?

01:54.830 --> 01:56.460
Because you don't get it.

01:56.460 --> 02:00.120
Okay, let me just ask.
Mm-hmm?

02:00.120 --> 02:01.790
What happens
if we don't do this?

02:01.790 --> 02:04.790
I don't know.

02:04.790 --> 02:06.710
She'll probably go
in the system.

02:06.710 --> 02:07.880
Oh, no.
Babe, it's -- it's not great.

02:07.880 --> 02:09.330
All right, no.

02:09.330 --> 02:11.330
We -- We --
We are doing this.

02:11.330 --> 02:13.210
Okay.
Diane: Doing what?

02:14.790 --> 02:16.460
So...
Mm-hmm.

02:16.460 --> 02:18.120
...Kyra arrives tomorrow...
Yep. Mm-hmm.

02:18.120 --> 02:21.620
...and we are putting her
in Zoey's room.

02:21.620 --> 02:23.290
And trust me, you guys.

02:23.290 --> 02:24.620
You're gonna love Kyra.
Mm-hmm.

02:24.620 --> 02:26.500
Any questions?
Yeah, I have one.

02:26.500 --> 02:27.830
Who the heck is Kyra?

02:27.830 --> 02:29.210
You've been saying Kyra
like we're supposed to

02:29.210 --> 02:30.210
know who Kyra is.

02:30.210 --> 02:32.500
You know Kyra.
Ramona's daughter.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.540
From Compton, got arrested
for shoplifting.

02:34.540 --> 02:36.170
Both: What?
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:36.170 --> 02:38.170
Was that supposed to
be a secret?

02:38.170 --> 02:39.380
Dre: Guys,
it wasn't that serious.

02:39.380 --> 02:40.750
It's still
a prior arrest.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.920
And now she can get her second
and third strike

02:42.920 --> 02:44.210
here at our house.

02:44.210 --> 02:47.670
Guys, we are at capacity.
Look around.

02:47.670 --> 02:49.670
Does the fire department know
how many people live here?

02:49.670 --> 02:50.750
'Cause I'll call.

02:50.750 --> 02:52.540
Are you listening
to yourselves?

02:52.540 --> 02:55.170
You sound spoiled
and selfish.

02:55.170 --> 02:57.210
Yeah.
They sound smarter than you.

02:57.210 --> 03:00.330
Best case scenario, this
criminal robs us while we sleep.

03:00.330 --> 03:03.000
Worst case scenario,
she robs us while we're awake.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.080
More stabbing involved.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.670
Pops!
Okay, guys, enough!

03:05.670 --> 03:07.670
All right,
Kyra is a good girl.

03:07.670 --> 03:10.420
She's just gone through
some bad things.
Yeah.

03:10.420 --> 03:12.460
All right, we've got
to believe in people.
Yeah.

03:12.460 --> 03:14.040
Do we?

03:14.040 --> 03:16.790
Oh, I know you're not supposed
to have a favorite grandchild,

03:16.790 --> 03:18.620
but this one is solid.

03:18.620 --> 03:21.540
Do none of you have
any compassion?

03:21.540 --> 03:26.540
Well, I for one like that a
troubled youth is coming, okay?

03:26.540 --> 03:29.580
It puts us in a real-life
"Blind Side" situation.

03:29.580 --> 03:30.880
Huh?

03:30.880 --> 03:33.080
If Sandy Bullock
has shown us anything,

03:33.080 --> 03:37.290
it is that tough love can really
change a black kid's life.

03:37.290 --> 03:39.710
He is tempting me
to change my mind.

03:39.710 --> 03:41.620
Yeah. Mm-hmm.
But he is right.

03:41.620 --> 03:44.620
Mm-hmm.
This is happening.

03:44.620 --> 03:46.250
Yes, it is.

03:46.250 --> 03:47.880
We are incredible parents.
Yes, we are.

03:47.880 --> 03:49.920
And this is
a wonderful family,

03:49.920 --> 03:52.620
and we got this, okay?

03:52.620 --> 03:54.080
Mm-hmm.
And we're gonna kill it.

03:54.080 --> 03:57.120
Love you like my daughter,
Rainbow.

03:57.120 --> 03:58.460
But you're lying
to these children.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.330
Wow. Hey, Dre.
Why so happy?

04:05.330 --> 04:08.330
-Yeah.
-Oh, did they just free Mumia?

04:08.330 --> 04:11.120
No, but I'm doing my part
to make it better.

04:11.120 --> 04:13.580
My cousin's daughter Kyra's
coming to live with us.

04:13.580 --> 04:14.580
-Ah.
-Ah.
-Oh. Whoa.

04:14.580 --> 04:17.000
Ah, I admire
your sense of goodwill.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.790
Now, does this charity extend
to a beloved co-worker

04:19.790 --> 04:21.580
whose house may or may not
be rented out

04:21.580 --> 04:23.290
for an adult film trilogy?

04:23.290 --> 04:25.750
That -- That's
where you eat, man.

04:25.750 --> 04:26.920
Yes, it is.

04:26.920 --> 04:29.120
Dre, seriously.

04:29.120 --> 04:31.710
Why are you adding kids
to your home, hmm?

04:31.710 --> 04:33.120
You should be
removing them.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.330
Look,
boarding schools exist

04:35.330 --> 04:37.880
so that our children can be
raised by professionals,

04:37.880 --> 04:39.290
as God intended.

04:39.290 --> 04:41.540
Yeah, I went to
boarding school,

04:41.540 --> 04:43.290
and I hardly ever cry
when I shower anymore.

04:43.290 --> 04:44.880
Look, Dre.

04:44.880 --> 04:47.290
You're not really
taking on this kid, right?

04:47.290 --> 04:48.290
Of course I am.

04:48.290 --> 04:50.290
This is a privilege.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.960
To take care of our own,
that's what we do,

04:52.960 --> 04:54.790
ever since
the Great Migration,

04:54.790 --> 04:56.960
when our people
had to leave the Deep South

04:56.960 --> 04:58.330
to escape oppression.

04:58.330 --> 05:00.120
The only way we were
able to do that

05:00.120 --> 05:02.620
is if our relatives
took us in.

05:02.620 --> 05:04.960
Well, that --
that's great, boss. In theory.

05:04.960 --> 05:08.120
See, I let my cousin stay
with me, and he crushed me.

05:08.120 --> 05:10.540
What happened?
He stole my identity,

05:10.540 --> 05:13.540
and now my credit score
is eight.
Well, look.

05:13.540 --> 05:15.540
I'm not worried about it
because she's just a kid.

05:15.540 --> 05:17.830
Oh, well, that's better.

05:17.830 --> 05:21.380
I mean, except for the fact
that she is emotionally damaged,

05:21.380 --> 05:23.000
financially dependent upon you,

05:23.000 --> 05:26.330
and you're liable
for any crime she commits.

05:26.330 --> 05:28.670
You know what?
I'm just gonna do my best,

05:28.670 --> 05:30.670
and if it doesn't
work out...

05:30.670 --> 05:34.040
Ah, it's gonna work out.
You're gonna kill it.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.500
Soon, all your relatives

05:35.500 --> 05:37.250
will be dropping
their kids off to you

05:37.250 --> 05:40.170
until your pass-around kids
outnumber your real kids.

05:40.170 --> 05:42.170
Sick of it,
Bow will then leave you.

05:42.170 --> 05:43.580
You'll probably
lose the house

05:43.580 --> 05:46.500
feeding and clothing
all those kids,

05:46.500 --> 05:49.000
but you'll be celebrated
on a Black History Month stamp

05:49.000 --> 05:51.250
and then die
at the age of 51.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.830
Packed funeral, though.
I'll be there.

05:53.830 --> 05:55.080
With Bow.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.540
Bow Telphy.

05:57.540 --> 06:01.880
I don't want to lose
my wife or my house.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.040
I don't want to be on
a Black History stamp,

06:04.040 --> 06:07.620
and my credit score's
the best thing about me!

06:07.620 --> 06:09.420
I don't want to do this!

06:09.420 --> 06:11.880
Damn it, why can't I turn
my back on my family

06:11.880 --> 06:13.210
like the white man does?

06:13.210 --> 06:15.080
Josh: Dre.

06:15.080 --> 06:17.460
There's still time.

06:20.880 --> 06:24.710
Bow, we cannot do this,
all right?!

06:24.710 --> 06:27.040
We are not accepting anybody
else into this house!

06:27.040 --> 06:29.420
I want everybody to act like the
Jehovah Witnesses are outside!

06:29.420 --> 06:31.460
Turn off the lights
and turn off the TV

06:31.460 --> 06:32.420
because Kyra is gonna
have to take care of Kyra.

06:32.420 --> 06:34.420
Rainbow: Dre? Dre?
Hmm?

06:34.420 --> 06:37.000
Kyra's here.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.290
Hey.
Hey.

06:38.290 --> 06:40.580
Hey...Kyra.

06:40.580 --> 06:43.830
Why are you, uh -- Why do you
have that look on your face?

06:43.830 --> 06:46.460
Hmm?

06:46.460 --> 06:48.620
You know -- Will somebody
please say something?

06:48.620 --> 06:50.580
You are ridiculous, son.

06:58.250 --> 06:59.580
So we just want to say again
that we're so happy...
Yeah.

06:59.580 --> 07:00.420
...that you are
staying with us.
Mm-hmm.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.290
And ignore everything that --
that he said.

07:03.290 --> 07:04.920
Well, you know,
my sugars were low.

07:04.920 --> 07:05.920
Yeah.

07:05.920 --> 07:08.330
No, I get it.
Everybody's nervous.

07:08.330 --> 07:09.750
You haven't seen me in years.
Mm-hmm.

07:09.750 --> 07:11.580
And now I'm living here.
Yeah.

07:11.580 --> 07:13.080
For all you know, I'm gonna have
my friends run up in here

07:13.080 --> 07:14.250
and rob the place.

07:14.250 --> 07:15.750
Huh?
What?

07:15.750 --> 07:19.330
N-- Okay, so we're not
in a joking place yet.

07:19.330 --> 07:21.620
Now, that's funny.

07:21.620 --> 07:24.330
Oh, that was a --

07:24.330 --> 07:25.460
That's a joke!

07:25.460 --> 07:27.040
Okay, come on.
It's hilarious.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.170
Come on. Let's go.
Okay. Come on, sweetheart.

07:28.170 --> 07:29.380
This is, um...

07:29.380 --> 07:31.210
This is where you're gonna stay.
Right in here.

07:31.210 --> 07:33.960
Yep. This, uh...
This is your room.

07:33.960 --> 07:34.960
-Yeah.
-Mm-hmm.

07:34.960 --> 07:38.710
Wow.
This is really nice.

07:38.710 --> 07:40.330
Okay, well,
get yourself settled in,

07:40.330 --> 07:41.710
and I'll go downstairs
and get the rest of your stuff.

07:41.710 --> 07:43.330
-Yeah.
-This backpack is it.

07:43.330 --> 07:45.500
A couple years ago,
I stayed in a shelter for a bit,

07:45.500 --> 07:47.330
and all my stuff got stolen.

07:47.330 --> 07:49.670
Oh, my God.
Turns out,
I love to travel light.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.000
Bow, I don't think
that was a joke.

07:54.000 --> 07:55.380
That one wasn't a --
No, I'm serious.

07:55.380 --> 07:56.790
Okay.
Okay. Bye.

07:56.790 --> 07:59.000
-Mm-hmm.
-Dre, all she has is that --

07:59.000 --> 08:01.880
that one sad,
little backpack.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.580
Yeah, I know.
Poor little girl.

08:04.580 --> 08:07.210
My -- "Poor little girl"?
Mm-hmm.

08:07.210 --> 08:09.670
Five minutes ago, you were ready
to throw her out on the street.

08:09.670 --> 08:11.080
I'm not a good person,
Bow.

08:11.080 --> 08:13.080
Hurt people hurt people.

08:13.080 --> 08:14.670
Oh, I know.
She has nothing.

08:14.670 --> 08:16.540
She knows nobody.

08:16.540 --> 08:19.210
She probably doesn't even know
when her own birthday is.

08:19.210 --> 08:21.380
We've really
got to go all out.

08:21.380 --> 08:23.000
Yeah, we do.
Dre, we've got to --

08:23.000 --> 08:26.000
we've got to shower her
with love, hugs, and --

08:26.000 --> 08:28.830
Forget love.
She needs stuff.

08:28.830 --> 08:31.040
Stuff?
Have you seen her shoe game?

08:31.040 --> 08:33.250
No.
She's not showing it,

08:33.250 --> 08:35.170
but it's probably
killing her on the inside.

08:35.170 --> 08:37.670
You think that's what she's
dying on the inside about?

08:37.670 --> 08:39.830
Mm-hmm.
Not about the fact
that her mother's in jail?

08:39.830 --> 08:42.210
Well, at least her mother
has a release date.

08:42.210 --> 08:44.040
Oh, my God.
No telling how long

08:44.040 --> 08:45.540
she's not gonna be fresh.

08:48.420 --> 08:51.420
Jack: Man, Kyra posts
a lot of inspirational quotes.

08:51.420 --> 08:54.040
Hmm.
"Be your own boyfriend"?

08:54.040 --> 08:55.420
Something happened.
Mm. Yeah.

08:55.420 --> 08:57.040
Like murder.
Yeah.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.380
What are you guys doing?

08:58.380 --> 09:00.750
Oh, stalking our cousin Kyra
on Instagram.

09:00.750 --> 09:02.380
Yeah, she just moved in with us,
and she might be dangerous.

09:02.380 --> 09:03.120
Mm.

09:03.120 --> 09:05.540
Let me see.
Okay.

09:05.540 --> 09:07.380
You think the girl
with the braces

09:07.380 --> 09:09.540
and the bunny-filter selfies
is dangerous?

09:09.540 --> 09:12.040
Maybe you're just scared
of black people.

09:12.040 --> 09:13.460
Hey, watch it, Glasses.

09:13.460 --> 09:15.880
I'm just saying she looks like
your everyday,

09:15.880 --> 09:21.080
cute, pretty, super-foxy,
possibly available teenager.

09:21.080 --> 09:24.170
Okay, dude. We get it.
You're going through puberty.

09:24.170 --> 09:26.250
Whatever.
That girl's harmless.

09:26.250 --> 09:28.500
Maybe she is just normal.

09:28.500 --> 09:30.580
Here she is with her friends
at the beach.

09:30.580 --> 09:32.750
Beach pic?
Yeah.

09:32.750 --> 09:35.500
A one-piece?
Dude, don't waste my time.

09:41.170 --> 09:45.920
Good morning, Kyra.
Welcome to your second chance.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.750
How long have you
been waiting there?

09:47.750 --> 09:48.750
Your whole life.

09:49.750 --> 09:51.580
But for real, 22 minutes.

09:51.580 --> 09:55.670
I'm gonna be your bridge from
urban life to suburban life.

09:55.670 --> 09:57.920
I got you this.

09:57.920 --> 10:02.920
It's for you to write down your
thoughts, feelings, poetry.

10:02.920 --> 10:05.290
That book will be something
you leave behind

10:05.290 --> 10:07.040
that says you were here.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.460
This is what happened.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.620
You...matter.

10:10.620 --> 10:14.000
I appreciate this.
Mm-hmm.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.040
I think that's
a lady's jacket.

10:18.460 --> 10:21.460
Uh...

10:21.460 --> 10:24.290
Just remember --
it's not your fault!

10:24.290 --> 10:27.290
I will say that as many times
as it takes!

10:28.460 --> 10:30.290
Got her.

10:30.290 --> 10:33.290
Hey. Hey, there.

10:33.290 --> 10:35.290
Hey.
So, um, made
a little breakfast.

10:35.290 --> 10:37.460
Got, um -- Okay,
we've got, uh, pancakes.

10:37.460 --> 10:39.380
Mm-hmm.
Pancakes.
And I made bacon.

10:39.380 --> 10:42.210
Irish scones,
English muffins.
Mm-hmm.

10:42.210 --> 10:44.380
Just bread
from every country,

10:44.380 --> 10:46.710
and holler
if you want some...

10:46.710 --> 10:48.170
challah!

10:48.170 --> 10:49.540
Yeah. Had my coffee.

10:49.540 --> 10:52.000
Thanks, but I don't
usually eat breakfast.
Oh?

10:52.000 --> 10:54.420
If I get hungry, I just
grab something from the
vending machine at school.

10:54.420 --> 10:55.750
Well, it's too much sugar.
That's too much sugar.
Okay, no, no, no.
Well, here, then.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.170
Um, why don't you, uh --
vending machine.

10:57.170 --> 10:58.330
Here, just take the $20.
Yeah.

10:58.330 --> 10:59.750
Y-You know?
No, just give me that.

10:59.750 --> 11:02.500
Just take a $50.
You know what? Take $100.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.000
You know what?
Just -- Just take it all.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.830
You know, just -- just make it
rain Skittles at school.

11:05.830 --> 11:08.000
I'm good.
Okay.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.830
Oh.
This is yours. Okay.

11:09.830 --> 11:11.580
Um, I've got to go
before I miss my bus.

11:11.580 --> 11:13.000
Oh, no. Just --
Uh, let me drive you.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.080
Are you kidding me?
Oh, it's so easy.
Mm-hmm.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.670
Easy. It's like home,
Compton, hospital.

11:17.670 --> 11:19.500
It's like blip!
It's fine.

11:19.500 --> 11:20.830
Are you sure?
I'll see you tonight.

11:20.830 --> 11:22.380
Here, hold on. Let me --
I-I'll see you tonight.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.170
Do you want to take a --
take a --
I'll see you tonight.

11:23.170 --> 11:24.540
All right. Okay.
Well, you know what?

11:24.540 --> 11:26.500
Um, I'll just leave
this loose money in your room!

11:26.500 --> 11:28.170
Maybe the croissant
for later.

11:28.170 --> 11:30.750
Why did you scare her off
with this weirdo breakfast?

11:30.750 --> 11:31.880
Me?!

11:31.880 --> 11:33.290
Kids from the hood
don't eat granola.

11:33.290 --> 11:34.880
There's so much --
We don't have fluoride
in our water.

11:34.880 --> 11:37.380
We can't chew it.
And you're just gonna
throw money at her

11:37.380 --> 11:40.040
and make her love you?
I'm a powerful man.

11:40.040 --> 11:41.380
That's what I do.
Okay.

11:41.380 --> 11:44.210
Did we -- Did we --
Did we do too much?

11:44.210 --> 11:46.420
Of course we did too much.

11:46.420 --> 11:48.040
I tried to give her $9,000.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.080
We have five kids, okay?
Mm-hmm.

11:50.080 --> 11:53.290
We -- We know how to do this.
Yeah, we do.

11:53.290 --> 11:55.710
Let's just...treat her
like one of our kids.

11:55.710 --> 11:57.710
And not just like any one
of them, you know,

11:57.710 --> 11:59.250
o-one of the ones we like.

11:59.250 --> 12:01.420
We like all of our kids, Dre.
Oh, yeah? Speak for yourself.

12:03.460 --> 12:08.040
So the plan was we would treat
Kyra like one of our kids.

12:08.040 --> 12:10.620
Only problem was,
some of our kids

12:10.620 --> 12:13.250
were acting like they lost
their damn minds.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.460
♪ Been spending
most their lives ♪

12:15.460 --> 12:17.830
♪ Living in
the gangsta's paradise ♪
What's that?

12:17.830 --> 12:18.960
What are you...?

12:18.960 --> 12:21.500
Oh.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.750
Oh.

12:23.750 --> 12:25.290
What are you doing?

12:25.290 --> 12:27.500
Just wanted to
let Kyra know...

12:27.500 --> 12:29.790
"You're the man now, dawg."

12:29.790 --> 12:32.750
Get your ass out of here and
take your mama's jacket off.

12:32.750 --> 12:35.500
Jack: Guys, she doesn't
need to be saved anyway.

12:35.500 --> 12:36.750
She's cool.

12:36.750 --> 12:38.500
Yeah, one of her
hair-braiding videos

12:38.500 --> 12:40.250
got liked by
Michelle Obama.

12:40.250 --> 12:42.290
You two should not
be stalking Kyra.

12:42.290 --> 12:43.750
We are not stalking her.

12:43.750 --> 12:45.580
"Karen Miller"
is stalking her.

12:45.580 --> 12:47.620
Who's Karen Miller?
That's our Finstagram.

12:47.620 --> 12:49.290
We have
a fake Instagram?

12:49.290 --> 12:50.580
Uh, yeah.

12:50.580 --> 12:52.880
I've been using,
"This is Jack Johnson."

12:52.880 --> 12:54.670
This is why
I work alone!

12:54.670 --> 12:56.380
Guys, put the phones down.

12:56.380 --> 12:59.540
We need to treat Kyra like
a member of our family,

12:59.540 --> 13:00.540
which she is.

13:00.540 --> 13:01.620
Mm-hmm.

13:01.620 --> 13:03.210
So put -- put -- Hello.
Oh, hey.

13:03.210 --> 13:05.460
Hello, Kyra. Hi.
Hi.

13:05.460 --> 13:06.620
Hey, there.

13:06.620 --> 13:08.210
Yeah, and look at that.
And you brought a --

13:08.210 --> 13:10.290
You brought a f-f-friend.
Hello.

13:10.290 --> 13:13.000
Okay, well, that's fine.
I mean, we love it.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.790
Our kids bring friends
all the time.
Mm-hmm.

13:14.790 --> 13:16.170
It's -- If you just let us
know, we can put --

13:16.170 --> 13:17.620
make a little plate.

13:17.620 --> 13:19.000
Anyway, we're cool with that.
Aren't you?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.290
Yeah, we're cool, aren't we?
Yeah -- Yeah.

13:20.290 --> 13:22.330
As soon as I find out if that
face tat is real.

13:22.330 --> 13:23.960
It is.
Oh, my goodness.

13:23.960 --> 13:25.170
Impressive.
Did that hurt?

13:25.170 --> 13:26.620
Oh.
No?

13:26.620 --> 13:29.620
Cool. Everybody,
this is my girl, Stunts.
Mm-hmm.

13:29.620 --> 13:31.120
Do you mind
if she stays for dinner?

13:31.120 --> 13:32.540
No. Not at all. Nope.
No.

13:32.540 --> 13:34.750
I heard y'all
got hella bread.

13:34.750 --> 13:36.580
We do.
Oh, yes.

13:36.580 --> 13:38.540
Holler if you want some...
Hey, okay, hey.

13:38.540 --> 13:40.540
...challah!
Aah, no, baby.

13:40.540 --> 13:42.580
No, I ate it.

13:42.580 --> 13:45.170
You got another name? 'Cause
I'm not calling you "Stunts."

13:45.170 --> 13:47.540
My government name
is Susan.

13:47.540 --> 13:49.330
Hate to admit it.
You look more like a Stunts.

13:49.330 --> 13:52.080
I'm gonna go guard
my belongings.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.920
For no reason at all.

13:54.920 --> 13:58.330
So Mason just couldn't stop
bragging about wearing boxers.

13:58.330 --> 14:00.500
And then his doctor said that...
-Okay. Okay.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.420
-...he had to wear the boxers.
-Okay. Okay.

14:02.420 --> 14:05.420
That guy.
Okay.
Oh, that guy, yeah. Okay.

14:05.420 --> 14:08.380
Anybody else want to tell us
about their day?

14:08.380 --> 14:10.000
-Mm.
-Anybody?

14:10.000 --> 14:12.000
-Anybody?
-Kyra?

14:12.000 --> 14:14.170
Nah, I'm good.
Dre: Come on, Kyra.
You know, say something.

14:14.170 --> 14:16.460
This is how we catch up
with our kids.

14:16.460 --> 14:18.880
Oh, tell them about when
the math teacher clowned you.

14:18.880 --> 14:20.460
For what?

14:20.460 --> 14:21.880
Mr. Fisher's stupid.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.880
I got a question wrong,
so he said I'm lucky I'm pretty.

14:23.880 --> 14:25.960
Oh, my.
Oh.

14:25.960 --> 14:28.040
It's not a big deal.

14:28.040 --> 14:31.040
Well, yeah, it is.
I mean, he can't do that.

14:31.040 --> 14:33.040
Yeah, that's not
a compliment.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.040
Look, every urban
success story needs

14:36.040 --> 14:38.580
a white authority figure
who, you know,

14:38.580 --> 14:40.920
just doesn't
see their greatness.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.290
Mr. Fisher's black.

14:42.290 --> 14:43.880
Oh, then I got nothing.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.620
Did you ever?

14:45.620 --> 14:48.710
I was cooking with a little
something at the beginning.

14:50.040 --> 14:51.790
Thank y'all for dinner.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.880
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.

14:53.880 --> 14:56.710
And you know what?
You are welcome here anytime.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.830
Anytime. Mm-hmm.

15:00.830 --> 15:05.750
Oh, and, Kyra, you no longer
have to worry about Mr. Fisher.

15:05.750 --> 15:07.420
Did he die?
What?

15:07.420 --> 15:09.120
He was really old.
Maybe we'll get the day off.

15:09.120 --> 15:10.330
No. No, no, no.

15:10.330 --> 15:13.580
Um, we e-mailed the school.
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.580
Because it's not okay for him
to talk to you that way.

15:15.580 --> 15:17.580
You really
didn't have to do that.

15:17.580 --> 15:19.750
It's okay. One of my favorite
things to do as an adult

15:19.750 --> 15:21.750
is scream
at public employees.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.290
Mm-hmm.
He's very good at it.

15:23.290 --> 15:26.500
Okay. I'm gonna walk Stunts
to the bus.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.580
Okay.
Baby, baby!

15:28.580 --> 15:30.120
Bye, guys!
Mm-hmm.

15:30.120 --> 15:32.420
Walk safe.

15:32.420 --> 15:34.000
We did so good.
Are you kidding me?

15:34.000 --> 15:36.290
She blended
right into our family.

15:36.290 --> 15:38.790
Arguably better than Junior.

15:38.790 --> 15:42.330
Now, I'm gonna put
Raisinets in our popcorn

15:42.330 --> 15:45.540
this evening
because we deserve it.

15:45.540 --> 15:46.710
Yes, we have.
Yes, my bearded lover.

15:46.710 --> 15:48.710
Okay. All right.

15:48.710 --> 15:51.120
-Mm!
-Oh, mine's good.
-Uh, what are we waiting for?

15:51.120 --> 15:53.500
Mmm. Kyra.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.880
She'll be back
in 20 minutes.

15:56.880 --> 15:58.830
Um...

15:58.830 --> 16:00.880
Do you think she's lost?

16:00.880 --> 16:02.120
I mean, you know,
all these houses

16:02.120 --> 16:03.620
look the same in the dark.

16:03.620 --> 16:05.540
Takes time to see
which one of these houses

16:05.540 --> 16:07.710
has an ADT sign out front,
Rainbow.

16:07.710 --> 16:09.960
Pops, please.

16:09.960 --> 16:11.620
I-I'm a little
worried, Dre.

16:11.620 --> 16:14.620
Well, she's with Stunts.

16:14.620 --> 16:16.880
I mean, how much trouble
can they actually get into?

16:16.880 --> 16:18.290
You're better than this,
Rainbow.

16:19.380 --> 16:21.380
All right, look.
I -- I -- I checked the bus stop

16:21.380 --> 16:23.170
and drove around
the block and nothing.

16:23.170 --> 16:24.380
You know, I'm gonna
call June Bug.

16:24.380 --> 16:26.580
Yeah, and it keeps
going to voice mail.

16:27.750 --> 16:30.750
Hey, June Bug!
Kyra's missing, man!

16:30.750 --> 16:32.080
Oh, right.

16:32.080 --> 16:33.750
Yeah, I forgot to tell you,
man, she's a runner.

16:33.750 --> 16:35.170
Oh, my God.

16:35.170 --> 16:36.830
You okay, cuz?

16:36.830 --> 16:39.170
Look like you living
that stressed-out life.

16:39.170 --> 16:40.880
You need to be living
that Herba--

16:45.170 --> 16:46.170
I can't believe
she ran away.

16:46.170 --> 16:47.380
It really seems like
something

16:47.380 --> 16:48.670
June Bug should
have warned us about.

16:48.670 --> 16:50.000
I mean,
she could be anywhere.

16:50.000 --> 16:51.670
Don't worry, guys.
We can track her on Instagram.

16:51.670 --> 16:53.250
She went private,

16:53.250 --> 16:55.420
thanks to
"This is Jack Johnson."

16:55.420 --> 16:57.170
Okay, we don't know
that she knew it was me.

16:59.540 --> 17:01.830
I was hoping it wouldn't
come to this.

17:01.830 --> 17:03.250
What are you
talking about?

17:03.250 --> 17:05.420
She's probably gone back
to the bullet-riddled,

17:05.420 --> 17:07.540
gang-infested streets
of her youth,

17:07.540 --> 17:11.040
trying to decide between
the life she's always known

17:11.040 --> 17:14.710
and the life that she doesn't
quite yet understand.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.880
I'm gonna go down there
and get her.

17:19.080 --> 17:22.080
And you can't stop me!

17:22.080 --> 17:23.880
Even if you try!
I won't.

17:23.880 --> 17:25.920
Oh, my God.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.540
Guys, I said
"bullet-riddled."

17:27.540 --> 17:28.620
Mm-hmm.
Oh, my God.

17:28.620 --> 17:30.250
Do you see how much red
I'm wearing?

17:31.880 --> 17:33.380
Mom?

17:33.380 --> 17:35.210
I --

17:35.210 --> 17:37.750
Fine. I guess you're ready
to lose two kids tonight.

17:37.750 --> 17:40.380
Junior, don't you even think
about leaving this house.

17:40.380 --> 17:42.920
Oh. Oh, God bless you, Pops.
Thank you so much.

17:42.920 --> 17:44.580
Look, guys.
It's late.

17:44.580 --> 17:46.500
We're not gonna
have movie night,

17:46.500 --> 17:48.250
so why don't everybody
just go get ready for bed?

17:48.250 --> 17:50.080
Go.

17:50.080 --> 17:54.290
I'm a grown-ass man.
You can't tell me to go to bed.

17:54.290 --> 17:57.080
But I'm tired, so...
I'm going to bed.

17:57.080 --> 17:58.250
Good night, Pops.

17:58.250 --> 17:59.460
Good night.
Night, Pops.

18:02.120 --> 18:04.290
Bow, a girl that young does not
need to be out this late.

18:04.290 --> 18:08.500
I know. I mean,
we were gonna watch a movie.

18:08.500 --> 18:11.000
Everything was fine,
and look what happened.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.580
You know, she's -- she's
bounced from house to house,

18:14.580 --> 18:16.620
and we're expecting her
to fold right in,

18:16.620 --> 18:19.250
and -- and have everything go
smoothly in two days.

18:19.250 --> 18:22.080
I guess we just pushed her
too hard again.

18:22.080 --> 18:24.250
Maybe we did.
I don't know.

18:24.250 --> 18:27.500
I mean, what were
we supposed to do?

18:29.330 --> 18:31.710
This is so much harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

18:32.830 --> 18:35.290
Maybe we don't know
what we're doing, Dre.

18:35.290 --> 18:37.330
I mean, we have five kids,
but we've never done this.

18:37.330 --> 18:38.790
So what do we do?

18:38.790 --> 18:40.380
Okay.

18:40.380 --> 18:42.620
Let's sit her down.
Mm-hmm?

18:42.620 --> 18:46.960
And have...a calm conversation
about what our expectations are.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.540
Oh, my God!

18:49.540 --> 18:52.170
Hey, Where the hell were you?
Dre.

18:52.170 --> 18:56.620
What he means is,
"Where the hell were you?"
I needed some air.

18:56.620 --> 18:58.460
Everything you guys were doing
was stressing me out.

18:58.460 --> 19:00.000
W--
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

19:00.000 --> 19:01.290
We get it, all right?

19:01.290 --> 19:03.380
But, Kyra,
we were worried about you.

19:03.380 --> 19:05.210
Yeah, what you did
won't work here.

19:05.210 --> 19:06.790
We need to know
where you are.

19:06.790 --> 19:10.330
I'm sorry, but you guys
were just being so extra.

19:10.330 --> 19:13.750
Uh, okay. Look.
Even though we did too much,

19:13.750 --> 19:16.080
we're gonna do whatever we need
to do to look out for you.

19:16.080 --> 19:19.080
And, Kyra,
we have rules.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.500
Sometimes, we're gonna
call your teachers.

19:21.500 --> 19:23.500
And if you slam
your bedroom door,

19:23.500 --> 19:25.380
I remove your bedroom door.
Uh, it's -- Okay.

19:25.380 --> 19:26.830
Well, I'll -- I'll stop him
from doing that.

19:26.830 --> 19:28.170
But she can't stop me.
I'll take the hammer.

19:28.170 --> 19:29.830
Take the hammer.
I got a screwdriver.

19:29.830 --> 19:31.000
Well, I'll take that, too.
Okay, well, then,

19:31.000 --> 19:32.420
I'll pull it off
with my bare hands.

19:32.420 --> 19:33.670
I don't think
he's strong enough.
Okay.

19:33.670 --> 19:36.040
I know this is a lot,
but if you give us some time,

19:36.040 --> 19:37.170
we'll figure it out.

19:37.170 --> 19:40.580
I know we're not
your parents,

19:40.580 --> 19:42.500
but we really care
what happens to you.

19:42.500 --> 19:46.080
I get it.

19:46.080 --> 19:49.750
And that's really
sweet and really nice.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.750
You know,
if you want to drive me

19:55.750 --> 20:01.540
on your home-Compton-hospital
route, I wouldn't say no.

20:01.540 --> 20:03.540
It's my favorite route.

20:07.880 --> 20:09.710
What are you doing?

20:09.710 --> 20:12.210
So you're having
the heart to heart without me.

20:12.210 --> 20:14.040
I do all the work.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.880
You swoop in at the end
to take all the credit.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.380
I --
Hmm.

20:18.380 --> 20:20.210
You know who's not
the man now?

20:20.210 --> 20:22.380
Mnh-mnh.
You, dawgs.

20:22.380 --> 20:26.040
I am usually on your side,
Junior.

20:26.040 --> 20:27.540
Oh, my God. I can't --

20:27.540 --> 20:29.120
Oh.

20:29.120 --> 20:30.580
Yeah. Careful.

20:35.620 --> 20:37.170
Parenting.

20:37.170 --> 20:38.580
Some people think
you've got to read books

20:38.580 --> 20:41.170
or go to lectures
to be good at it.

20:41.170 --> 20:43.170
Turns out, we probably should

20:43.170 --> 20:45.580
have done both of those things.

20:45.580 --> 20:47.750
After 19 years of parenting...

20:47.750 --> 20:49.750
...Bow and I are still learning

20:49.750 --> 20:50.920
that it's constantly

20:50.920 --> 20:53.460
a work in progress.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.920
But the one thing we know
for sure is,

20:59.920 --> 21:03.330
you never let anything
interrupt your family dinner.
