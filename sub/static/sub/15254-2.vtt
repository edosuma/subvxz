00:00.928 --> 00:02.507
<i>Here are a few things that</i>
<i>you might need to know.</i>

00:04.415 --> 00:05.648
Let's dance.

00:08.185 --> 00:09.219
Hello, Chuck.

00:09.253 --> 00:10.687
Decker froze
Bale's accounts.

00:10.721 --> 00:11.888
Castle and the
Buy More are

00:11.922 --> 00:13.023
the only things
that aren't frozen.

00:13.057 --> 00:14.657
All of our money?
We have nothing?

00:14.692 --> 00:15.658
Payback's a bitch.

00:15.693 --> 00:17.027
The Buy More.

00:17.061 --> 00:18.728
We take Buy More's profits,
put them into

00:18.763 --> 00:20.930
Carmichael Industries until
both companies can make money.

00:22.767 --> 00:24.167
My name is Charles Carmichael,

00:24.201 --> 00:27.370
and I have
one final question for you.

00:27.405 --> 00:29.339
Have you ever needed to subdue

00:29.373 --> 00:31.758
a Basque terrorist
on a Swiss train?

00:31.792 --> 00:34.744
Or fight your way through
the jungles of Southeast Asia?

00:34.779 --> 00:36.613
Or take out an arms dealer

00:36.647 --> 00:39.115
with a penchant for murder
and ice cream?

00:39.150 --> 00:40.683
Well, we have.

00:40.718 --> 00:43.353
So, while considering
your security needs,

00:43.387 --> 00:45.855
when lives are on the line,
I implore you

00:45.890 --> 00:48.525
to consider us...

00:53.481 --> 00:55.265
It's not that one.

00:55.299 --> 00:56.132
It's not that...

00:56.167 --> 00:58.234
Carmichael Industries.

00:58.269 --> 00:59.702
Thank you.

01:02.940 --> 01:04.123
You did great.
That was great.

01:04.158 --> 01:05.408
- Mm-hmm.
- That was good.

01:05.441 --> 01:07.544
All right,

01:07.578 --> 01:09.379
we have one more
team presenting.

01:09.413 --> 01:11.781
They should be here,
uh, in any minute.

01:14.852 --> 01:15.952
What's happening?

01:23.527 --> 01:25.311
Wait, this is not a real attack,
is it?

01:29.483 --> 01:31.334
No, this is our competition.

01:33.370 --> 01:36.940
300 agents from all over
the world-- CIA, KGB,

01:36.974 --> 01:38.475
Mossad and Interpol.

01:38.509 --> 01:41.611
We work for the Pentagon,
we work for the Kremlin,

01:41.645 --> 01:43.580
and we'll work for you.

01:43.614 --> 01:46.616
My name is Gertrude Verbanski,

01:46.650 --> 01:49.119
and we are
Verbanski Corp.

01:49.153 --> 01:52.589
And if we can get to you,
we can get to anyone.

01:54.000 --> 02:00.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:05.686 --> 02:07.520
Verbanski.

02:07.555 --> 02:10.690
Yeah, Verbanski.

02:11.859 --> 02:13.309
Sorry, kind of got
carried away there.

02:13.343 --> 02:16.146
I thought-- this is not
a bit that we're...?

02:16.180 --> 02:17.347
Right.

02:17.381 --> 02:19.182
Uh, go ahead.

02:19.200 --> 02:20.850
Who is she?

02:20.885 --> 02:23.319
One of the KGB's
most ruthless spies

02:23.387 --> 02:24.921
till the fall of
the Soviet Union.

02:26.023 --> 02:28.458
Then she went into
the private security game.

02:28.492 --> 02:29.893
And how do you know her?

02:29.927 --> 02:32.629
Minsk, 1995.

02:32.663 --> 02:35.064
I was being a patriot,

02:35.099 --> 02:37.834
she was being
whatever she was paid to be.

02:37.868 --> 02:39.068
Wow, 1995.

02:39.103 --> 02:40.703
I was still in middle school.

02:43.090 --> 02:45.175
Anyway,

02:45.209 --> 02:47.877
we had an altercation.

02:47.895 --> 02:50.713
I ended up with a Rosewell blade
in my shoulder.

02:50.731 --> 02:53.917
Made a nasty scar right over
one of my favorite scars.

02:53.951 --> 02:56.553
Well, Verbanski is good.

02:56.587 --> 02:58.521
She took all of
our potential clients today.

02:58.556 --> 03:00.957
Awesome ditched rock climbing to
help me with the presentation.

03:00.991 --> 03:02.892
He is gonna be so disappointed.

03:02.927 --> 03:04.427
What do you mean
it didn't go well?

03:04.461 --> 03:06.079
Did you give
equal eye contact

03:06.113 --> 03:07.697
to all four quadrants
of the audience?

03:07.731 --> 03:09.899
It was, it was great,
all of your advice was great.

03:09.917 --> 03:11.000
Of course it was.

03:11.035 --> 03:13.002
Same tactics I used to
woo your hot sister.

03:13.037 --> 03:14.704
Okay.

03:14.738 --> 03:18.841
Um, look, we were just
a little outmatched is all.

03:18.876 --> 03:22.979
Well, at least you still
have the Buy More, bro.

03:23.013 --> 03:24.847
Still cash flow
coming in there.

03:27.151 --> 03:29.419
Right?

03:43.067 --> 03:44.033
What?

03:44.068 --> 03:45.802
Is that an actual tumbleweed?

03:45.836 --> 03:47.971
Yeah. Yeah, we put in
a new home and garden section

03:48.005 --> 03:49.405
to drum up business.
Just actually glad

03:49.439 --> 03:50.540
somebody put out
the tumbleweed.

03:50.574 --> 03:52.492
Oh, boy.

03:52.543 --> 03:55.278
Anyway, how was
the presentation?

03:55.296 --> 03:56.279
Not good.

03:56.297 --> 03:57.313
Not-Not good.

03:57.348 --> 03:58.881
Verbanski Corp
took all of our clients.

03:58.916 --> 04:00.450
Told you, you put me out there,

04:00.484 --> 04:02.468
you don't have to worry about
what other companies are doing.

04:02.503 --> 04:05.121
Look, I know I seem like
just an ordinary guy,

04:05.155 --> 04:07.957
but I am, in fact,
the Intersect.

04:07.992 --> 04:09.809
Multibillion
dollar CIA asset

04:09.843 --> 04:11.561
turned super-weapon-for-hire!

04:11.595 --> 04:13.296
Buddy, no one can know

04:13.330 --> 04:16.632
that we have the walking CIA
database on our team, okay?

04:16.666 --> 04:19.569
The Intersect is
a secret weapon for a reason.

04:19.603 --> 04:20.970
That sucks, man.

04:21.005 --> 04:23.273
I have all these powers and
abilities, and how am I supposed

04:23.307 --> 04:25.608
to help people if I can't
tell anybody about it?

04:25.643 --> 04:28.278
Because, Morgan, if you do,
it could get you killed!

04:38.205 --> 04:39.622
- Oh, I just zoomed.
- What?

04:39.656 --> 04:40.656
I just zoomed.

04:40.674 --> 04:41.924
There's a bad guy
in the Buy More.

04:41.959 --> 04:43.259
Are you sure?

04:43.294 --> 04:44.627
Know what we
got to do?

04:44.662 --> 04:45.795
We got to
take him down.

04:46.964 --> 04:48.514
Just, let's take a
breath here, okay?

04:48.549 --> 04:50.099
We got to be subtle
about this.

04:50.134 --> 04:51.667
He's going for a weapon.
He's coming at us.

04:54.138 --> 04:55.505
I'm in! I'm in!
Ah...

05:06.383 --> 05:08.651
Not good.

05:08.685 --> 05:11.321
You just found out that the zoom

05:11.355 --> 05:12.872
is mightier than
the sword, my friend.

05:12.906 --> 05:14.874
- Hey, hey, hey, hey. You okay?
- Oh, man, I feel incredible.

05:14.908 --> 05:17.076
Did you see that?
Did you like that whole

05:17.127 --> 05:18.294
"the zoom is mightier
than the sword?"

05:18.329 --> 05:19.495
Hey, Casey, thank God.

05:19.530 --> 05:21.130
We have a little bit
of a situation here.

05:21.165 --> 05:22.231
Listen, Bartowski.

05:22.266 --> 05:24.367
I just got a call
and someone actually

05:24.401 --> 05:25.835
wants to hire
Carmichael Industries.

05:25.869 --> 05:28.338
He's coming to the Buy More
to meet with us now.

05:38.382 --> 05:41.717
We actually just met.

Mr. Sneijder?

We are so sorry.

06:28.963 --> 06:30.830
Please, take a muffin.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.634
What's happening?

06:35.635 --> 06:37.335
Welcome to
Carmichael Industries.

06:37.370 --> 06:38.703
Uh, I must apologize for

06:38.738 --> 06:40.839
your unnecessarily
rough welcome, Mr. Sneijder.

06:40.873 --> 06:43.842
Or, uh, shall I call you Karl?

06:44.944 --> 06:46.144
You want a muffin or not?

06:47.146 --> 06:48.246
He made them fresh
this morning.

06:50.016 --> 06:53.718
Um, I-I just have one, uh,
little question for you.

06:53.753 --> 06:58.657
Is there a reason
why our, uh, partner

06:58.691 --> 07:01.660
thought that you were,
I don't know, a criminal?

07:01.694 --> 07:04.696
I do work in the diamond
industry in South Africa.

07:04.730 --> 07:06.631
We're not known for
keeping our hands clean.

07:06.666 --> 07:07.666
Hmm.

07:08.801 --> 07:10.702
I don't eat bran.

07:12.338 --> 07:13.355
Nobody does.

07:13.389 --> 07:14.839
I told you.

07:16.208 --> 07:17.675
Listen, I've come
to ask for your help

07:17.693 --> 07:19.177
on something
entirely legitimate.

07:21.647 --> 07:23.014
We're listening.

07:23.049 --> 07:26.384
My little brother
Wesley was kidnapped

07:26.419 --> 07:29.287
by a buyer I may have
wronged in the past.

07:29.321 --> 07:31.322
I don't know
where he's being held,

07:31.357 --> 07:32.857
but I do know
he's being tortured.

07:32.892 --> 07:35.377
My little brother--
he never wanted to have

07:35.411 --> 07:37.362
anything to do
with my affairs.

07:37.396 --> 07:39.264
He's a good man.

07:39.298 --> 07:40.899
And they will
kill him unless...

07:40.933 --> 07:43.134
We save him.

07:43.169 --> 07:45.136
Exactly.

07:45.171 --> 07:46.638
Why should we believe
these people

07:46.672 --> 07:48.006
actually took your brother?

07:52.578 --> 07:54.579
They sent me this.

07:58.084 --> 08:02.187
We gonna draw straws to
see who opens that thing?

08:02.221 --> 08:03.738
- Oh.
- Oh, my God.

08:03.773 --> 08:06.257
Oh, my-- that's
not even on ice.

08:06.292 --> 08:09.260
I don't-- that's probably not
gonna be able to be reattached.

08:09.295 --> 08:11.663
Listen, I-I know
it's not a lot of money,

08:11.697 --> 08:13.331
but I'm willing to offer you

08:13.365 --> 08:15.100
$200,000 upfront,

08:15.134 --> 08:18.269
and another 200,000 when
you deliver my brother to me.

08:18.304 --> 08:19.971
And I know you don't
want to help me,

08:20.005 --> 08:22.006
but please consider
helping my brother.

08:24.009 --> 08:25.343
No one else will.

08:25.377 --> 08:27.262
If you don't mind, Mr. Sneijder,

08:27.296 --> 08:30.081
we'll take some time to consider
your offer and check your facts.

08:30.099 --> 08:32.350
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

08:32.384 --> 08:34.251
Oh, uh...

08:34.285 --> 08:37.722
is your friend with the beard
going to be a problem?

08:37.756 --> 08:39.190
- No.
- No.

08:39.225 --> 08:40.892
No.

08:42.010 --> 08:44.813
You know, what Morgan did
today in the Buy More

08:44.864 --> 08:46.698
could've really
blown our cover.

08:46.732 --> 08:47.932
Look, the first
couple of months with

08:47.967 --> 08:49.117
the Intersect are
a big adjustment.

08:49.151 --> 08:51.703
Scary and exciting,
your hormones

08:51.737 --> 08:52.937
are totally
out of whack.

08:52.972 --> 08:54.439
You're really
rediscovering your body.

08:56.742 --> 08:59.077
It's a lot to take in,
that's all I'm saying.

08:59.111 --> 09:00.879
That's exactly why
he needs a handler.

09:00.913 --> 09:02.447
What?

09:02.481 --> 09:03.448
Who, me?

09:03.482 --> 09:05.166
You had Casey and me,
Chuck, okay?

09:05.217 --> 09:06.468
Morgan needs you.

09:10.289 --> 09:11.890
Hey, buddy.

09:11.924 --> 09:13.808
Hey, Chuck. Good.

09:13.843 --> 09:17.345
Listen, I wanted to,
uh... say sorry

09:17.396 --> 09:18.763
about what happened
with Sneijder.

09:18.798 --> 09:21.850
No, hey, buddy, you know,
look, I-I totally get it.

09:21.901 --> 09:23.101
It-It took me a while

09:23.135 --> 09:25.036
to be out there with the
Intersect, too, so...

09:25.070 --> 09:26.171
It's like, uh, Peter Parker.

09:26.205 --> 09:28.139
The Amazing Spider-Man.

09:28.174 --> 09:30.008
The thing is, it took him a
while, like, over a week

09:30.042 --> 09:31.409
to kind of really
harness in his powers,

09:31.443 --> 09:33.111
to really get ahold
of his Spidey sense.

09:33.145 --> 09:34.112
Right.

09:34.146 --> 09:35.413
So...

09:35.447 --> 09:37.448
Yeah.

09:37.483 --> 09:38.917
Uh, which, interestingly enough,

09:38.951 --> 09:41.452
kind of brings me to something
I wanted to talk to you about.

09:41.486 --> 09:44.656
Um, I was wondering
what you thought about

09:44.690 --> 09:47.859
me maybe being your handler?

09:47.893 --> 09:49.828
I could show
you the ropes

09:49.862 --> 09:51.696
just like Sarah and Casey
did for me.

09:51.730 --> 09:53.298
Yeah.

09:53.332 --> 09:54.299
Great. Yeah.

09:54.333 --> 09:55.567
And on missions, you know,

09:55.601 --> 09:57.769
you can still show off your...

09:59.004 --> 10:00.805
...zooms.

10:00.840 --> 10:02.173
But for now,
you know,

10:02.208 --> 10:03.358
we really got to keep
the Intersect

10:03.392 --> 10:04.809
under wraps and
focus on the store.

10:04.844 --> 10:06.361
Aloha, Chuck!

10:06.395 --> 10:07.445
Hello, stepchild!

10:07.479 --> 10:09.013
- Hey.
- Like my new threads?

10:09.048 --> 10:12.650
I just got back from four weeks
of sexual experimentation

10:12.685 --> 10:14.369
and snorkeling with

10:14.403 --> 10:15.954
my new wife in Hawaii.

10:15.988 --> 10:19.290
So, what you boys been up to?

10:19.325 --> 10:22.210
The Buy More seems... empty.

10:22.244 --> 10:25.363
Are we observing
International Pancake Day?

10:25.397 --> 10:27.065
No, no, no.

Tucker is not

10:36.542 --> 10:39.227

anything about that.

But we need something new,

10:48.153 --> 10:51.105

to save the Buy More.

10:51.156 --> 10:53.491
Hmm.

just the thing.

11:00.165 --> 11:01.666

11:09.241 --> 11:10.875
only two grand.

11:10.910 --> 11:13.611

11:43.242 --> 11:44.642

that showcases

11:44.677 --> 11:47.578
some of our more
current merchandise.

11:47.613 --> 11:50.615
Maybe what we're
looking for is a,

11:50.649 --> 11:52.216
is a fresh face,

11:52.251 --> 11:56.821
uh, to kind of tell people
that the Buy More, um, has

11:56.855 --> 11:59.307
something new
to offer.

11:59.341 --> 12:00.658
Hmm, yeah.

12:00.693 --> 12:02.894
Right?

12:03.929 --> 12:06.564
I hear you.

12:06.598 --> 12:07.966
Everybody wants something new.

12:13.989 --> 12:16.240
The finger is
a positive match, Casey.

12:16.275 --> 12:17.992
It definitely belongs
to Wesley Sneijder.

12:20.045 --> 12:22.146
Yeah, got it.

12:22.181 --> 12:23.781
You were right
on the location, too.

12:23.816 --> 12:24.815
Got eyeballs on Wesley.

12:24.833 --> 12:27.785
He's being held
in a guarded compound.

12:30.322 --> 12:32.957
Well, let's just see
how well protected you are.

12:40.549 --> 12:41.849
Whoa.
What the hell

12:41.884 --> 12:43.000
do you think you're doing?

12:43.018 --> 12:44.635
Hey, I'm just

12:44.670 --> 12:47.305
hunting waterfowl,
that's all.

12:47.339 --> 12:48.506
What are you doing?

12:48.524 --> 12:49.974
You're on private
property, man.

12:50.009 --> 12:52.026
Oh, well, my bad, then.

12:52.061 --> 12:54.979
Sorry, I didn't realize.

12:55.014 --> 12:57.615
No harm, no "foul."

12:59.201 --> 13:00.518
Get it?

13:00.552 --> 13:03.688
Okay,
have a nice day.

13:03.722 --> 13:05.690
I count at least 12 guards
with their weapons pointed

13:05.724 --> 13:07.792
straight at the entrance.
We are definitely not

13:07.826 --> 13:09.038
going in the front door.

13:09.063 --> 13:11.305
Well, there has
to be another way in.

13:11.306 --> 13:13.307
If there is, I'll find it.

13:15.447 --> 13:19.334
Oh, I get it, he meant,
he meant waterfowl.

Hello?

13:49.247 --> 13:51.648
Oh, please forgive me.

13:51.666 --> 13:52.950
It's our busy season.

13:52.984 --> 13:54.585
- Hi.
- Hi.

13:55.987 --> 13:57.338
Oh, yes,

13:57.372 --> 13:59.757
not many people have disarmed
Colonel Casey, but I like

13:59.791 --> 14:00.924
to remember all
of my victories,

14:00.959 --> 14:02.159
even the little ones.

14:02.193 --> 14:03.326
Have a seat.

14:03.345 --> 14:06.496
Uh, you mind telling
me what I'm here for?

14:06.514 --> 14:08.098
You said you had
some information.

14:08.133 --> 14:11.035
Verbanski Corp has
a job opening.

14:11.069 --> 14:13.103
And?

14:13.138 --> 14:14.972
And put simply, I want you.

14:15.006 --> 14:18.275
Private security isn't a game
you just try your hand at.

14:18.309 --> 14:21.045
I have agents in 38 different
countries under 15 separate

14:21.079 --> 14:24.014
Pentagon contracts worth
over $2 billion annually.

14:24.049 --> 14:25.482
Well, that's
very impressive.

14:25.517 --> 14:29.486
And what does
Carmichael Industries have,

14:29.520 --> 14:33.791
other than a former colonel
and a CEO with skinny arms?

14:33.825 --> 14:35.926
What am I really doing here?

14:35.960 --> 14:38.495
We both know that I'm not going
to leave my husband's company.

14:38.530 --> 14:40.698
Are you trying to
recruit John Casey?

14:44.002 --> 14:46.703
Is that his name
on that second folder?

14:46.721 --> 14:50.391
Let me be frank.

14:50.425 --> 14:52.710
I'm talking to you because
you're good, one of the best,

14:52.744 --> 14:55.479
but your company isn't going
to last, Miss Walker.

14:55.513 --> 14:57.097
You should switch
while you can.

14:57.148 --> 14:58.982
Well, first of all, it's Mrs.,

14:59.017 --> 15:00.150
and second of all,
I'm disappointed.

15:00.185 --> 15:01.351
I really thought
this was going

15:01.386 --> 15:03.387
to be the beginning of
a friendly cooperation

15:03.421 --> 15:04.988
between business
associates,

15:05.023 --> 15:07.357
but if it's competition
that you want,

15:07.391 --> 15:09.159
then I suggest
you watch your back.

15:12.197 --> 15:15.916
Oh, by the way, when
this whole thing ends,

15:15.950 --> 15:18.035
don't expect me to mount
anything of yours in my office.

15:18.069 --> 15:20.003
It's just tacky.

15:25.543 --> 15:27.711
<i>All right, Casey said</i>
<i>he wanted something light.</i>

15:27.745 --> 15:30.214
He said that,
but he doesn't mean it.

15:30.248 --> 15:32.015
Is this really the
best use of our time?

15:32.050 --> 15:33.550
We could be doing
so much more.

15:33.585 --> 15:34.885
A little zim-zam-zoom,

15:34.919 --> 15:36.453
some chop-socky.
Morgan.

15:36.488 --> 15:37.955
I, I know.

15:37.989 --> 15:39.690
I'm talking a lot
about the Intersect,

15:39.724 --> 15:42.726
but you know...
I finally get it, though.

15:42.761 --> 15:45.262
For the first time in my life,
I sort of feel as cool as you.

15:45.296 --> 15:47.614
I can't figure out
why I can't use what I have

15:47.649 --> 15:49.399
to make this,
this dusty little rock

15:49.433 --> 15:51.802
that we all have
to share,

15:51.836 --> 15:55.739
well, just a bit better
for all of us.

15:55.773 --> 15:56.974
It's a pretty good
speech...

15:59.644 --> 16:01.962
Morgan, look.

16:01.996 --> 16:03.113
My God.

16:03.131 --> 16:04.348
I know.

16:04.382 --> 16:06.333
This is it, this is what
I've been waiting for.

16:06.384 --> 16:09.920
What, what, what do you mean
what you've been waiting for?

16:09.954 --> 16:14.458
A chance for the Bearded
Bandit to come out and play.

16:14.492 --> 16:15.792
What are you talking about?

16:15.810 --> 16:16.994
This isn't a game.

16:17.028 --> 16:19.462
I know, but I can do this,
Chuck, I can save the day.

16:19.481 --> 16:21.498
Do you even know
what "bandit" means?

16:21.533 --> 16:23.934
It's like "robber"
or, or "crook."

16:23.968 --> 16:26.203
No, I Googled it; it's a-a
fighter aircraft...

16:26.237 --> 16:28.305
What? I don't under...
What did you say?

16:28.323 --> 16:30.440
I-- I Googled it.

16:30.474 --> 16:33.527
It's slang also for "fighter
aircraft," so there's that.

16:33.578 --> 16:34.978
This is not a good idea, Morgan.

16:35.013 --> 16:36.113

you want.

Just don't hurt me.
No, no, no... no,

17:04.342 --> 17:05.976
it's a slang term
for fighter-- for...

17:16.221 --> 17:18.070
Morgan.

17:18.122 --> 17:20.357
Nice save, Chuck.

17:20.391 --> 17:22.376

himself killed

21:34.989 --> 21:37.157
the gun from Minsk?

21:38.326 --> 21:40.327
She kept my gun?

21:41.362 --> 21:43.197
Oh, God,

21:43.248 --> 21:44.865
oh, God.

21:44.916 --> 21:46.983
Casey?

21:47.001 --> 21:48.786
Casey, I'm slipping.

21:48.820 --> 21:50.254
Casey!

21:55.260 --> 21:56.426
Looking good, babe.
You're doing

21:56.461 --> 21:57.544
good up there.

21:57.595 --> 21:59.329
You're doing good
up there. There you go.

21:59.347 --> 22:03.217
Geez. What's up with you
and Verbanski anyway?

22:03.268 --> 22:05.235
Don't worry, Walker.

22:05.270 --> 22:07.271
I got your back.

22:26.958 --> 22:29.426
Still climbing.

22:29.460 --> 22:31.728
Oh!

22:47.011 --> 22:48.595
All clear.

22:48.646 --> 22:50.380
All clear.

22:50.415 --> 22:52.316
Yeah. About time.

22:55.019 --> 22:57.421
Okay, Chuck,
this is all you.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.073
Oh, my God.
Who are you people?

23:17.091 --> 23:18.241
We're here to save you.

23:18.259 --> 23:19.090
What the hell
are you talking about?

23:19.091 --> 23:20.475
Oh, relax, Wesley.
Your brother hired us.

23:21.403 --> 23:22.603
He did what?!

23:22.881 --> 23:24.131
Whoa,, whoa, whoa, wh,
whoa. What are you doing?

23:24.165 --> 23:26.450
- We're here to protect you.
- From who?

23:26.484 --> 23:27.834
The only thing keeping
my brother

23:27.886 --> 23:29.553
from killing me are the men
I hired to guard this compound.

23:29.587 --> 23:31.521
What?!

23:34.559 --> 23:37.010
- But your finger?
- Yeah, who do you think cut it off?

23:37.061 --> 23:39.462
I'm trying to make a deal with
the Feds to testify against him!

23:39.480 --> 23:41.231
Okay, this is
a giant misunderstanding.

23:41.266 --> 23:42.983
We're not here to hurt you.

23:43.017 --> 23:44.467
Yeah, well, my men
will be here any second.

23:44.485 --> 23:46.353
Morgan, get the van ready.

23:46.404 --> 23:49.373
Morgan, do you copy?

23:52.777 --> 23:55.162
Morgan?

23:56.681 --> 23:58.481
Get back!

24:02.787 --> 24:05.088
Have a drilling
in the face!

24:07.091 --> 24:09.760
Nice one! That's what
I'm talking about!

24:09.794 --> 24:11.595
Zoom!

24:20.238 --> 24:22.272
What's up, team?

24:22.307 --> 24:23.907
You guys need some help?

24:23.942 --> 24:25.709
Yes and no?

24:25.743 --> 24:27.077
Okay...

24:32.717 --> 24:34.351
Mm. Okay, just zoomed.

24:34.385 --> 24:36.203
Wesley's brother's not trying
to save him. He's trying to...

24:36.237 --> 24:37.554
We know.

24:37.588 --> 24:39.556
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

24:39.590 --> 24:41.391
Maybe if the Intersect
wasn't stifled

24:41.426 --> 24:42.826
in the van,
we would have all known that

24:42.860 --> 24:44.027
ahead of time,
and I wouldn't

24:44.045 --> 24:46.380
have had to take out
all of Wesley's guards.

24:46.414 --> 24:47.631
Really sorry about that, dude.

24:47.665 --> 24:49.132
It's...

24:52.587 --> 24:54.504
Hey, Karl.

24:54.539 --> 24:55.889
My sat images

24:55.923 --> 24:58.542
show that you took care
of the guards at the compound.

24:58.576 --> 24:59.943
Nice work.

24:59.978 --> 25:02.045
I have a team coming up
the access road now

25:02.080 --> 25:03.213
to pick up my brother.

25:03.231 --> 25:04.614
Do you? Do you? That's great.

25:04.649 --> 25:05.782
That's great news.

25:05.817 --> 25:07.417
We'll be right here
waiting for 'em.

25:07.452 --> 25:09.052
Bye now.

25:09.070 --> 25:10.953
Karl's men are gonna
be here any minute.

25:11.814 --> 25:12.764
Yes.

25:12.765 --> 25:13.681
Well, then I'm a dead man.

25:13.706 --> 25:15.493
No. We came here to save
you, and that's exactly

25:16.327 --> 25:17.944
- what we're gonna do. Come on.
- What?! No, no, no, no.

25:17.996 --> 25:19.730
The Intersect runs from no man!

25:19.764 --> 25:21.415
For now, he does.

25:21.449 --> 25:22.282
Let's go, Morgan.

25:26.894 --> 25:28.094
We had a deal.

25:28.333 --> 25:29.210
Exactly.

25:29.211 --> 25:31.179
You hired us
to save your brother.

25:31.213 --> 25:34.015
No, I paid you to extract him
and bring him to me.

25:34.049 --> 25:35.816
Except that we didn't know you
were planning on killing him.

25:35.851 --> 25:38.553
Nor did we know you were
responsible for the finger

25:38.587 --> 25:39.854
cutting offage. That's crazy.

25:39.888 --> 25:43.457
Listen, you have exactly
four hours to deliver Wesley

25:43.492 --> 25:46.160
to me. Otherwise,
I'm coming after you,

25:46.195 --> 25:49.030
and trust me, that is something
you will not enjoy.

25:49.064 --> 25:51.899
And by the way, that comment
card you sent with the contract?

25:51.934 --> 25:53.534
Well, you can consider that...

25:56.071 --> 25:58.306
What are we
going to do?

25:58.340 --> 26:00.675
Well, we got a fingerless guy
sitting in the game room, and

26:00.709 --> 26:03.010
his psychopath brother is
threatening to come after us.

26:03.028 --> 26:05.346
So we go to the source.
Okay, we take out Karl

26:05.380 --> 26:06.480
before he gets to us.

26:06.514 --> 26:08.032
With what army?

26:08.066 --> 26:09.233
We don't work for the
government anymore.

26:09.284 --> 26:10.401
Well, if we can get

26:10.452 --> 26:11.569
to Beckman,
maybe she can help us

26:11.620 --> 26:13.054
put Wesley
into protective custody.

26:13.088 --> 26:15.356
No, there's no time for that.
Guys, we have to act now!

26:15.374 --> 26:16.857
We're not going
into a firefight unprepared.

26:16.892 --> 26:19.060
End of story.

26:20.462 --> 26:22.696
Kind of feel like a burrito.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.047
Why don't you go on a food
run for us, huh?

26:24.048 --> 26:24.628
A food run?

26:24.633 --> 26:26.601
- Yeah.
- Again, I am the Intersect.

26:26.635 --> 26:27.535
Then act like it.

26:27.569 --> 26:29.003
Okay, okay.
Why don't I just

26:29.037 --> 26:30.037
go with you, buddy?

26:30.055 --> 26:31.255
And we can get
a little breather

26:31.306 --> 26:32.723
while we wait to hear back

26:32.758 --> 26:34.342
from Beckman, okay?

26:34.376 --> 26:36.444
Don't forget the utensils.

26:38.547 --> 26:41.082
Thank you. Must have had
one too many

26:41.116 --> 26:42.900
piña coladas on
the plane, and

26:42.935 --> 26:44.852
my blood pressure is just
generally outrageous.

26:44.886 --> 26:47.722
I'm just glad I was here
for your dizzy spell.

26:47.756 --> 26:51.092
So, listen, Devon,
have you ever

26:51.126 --> 26:52.627
given any thought
to doing something

26:52.661 --> 26:54.595
that involves less
doctoring and more

26:54.630 --> 26:56.397
making a commercial
for the Buy More?

26:56.431 --> 26:57.765
What?

26:57.799 --> 26:59.700
The Buy More needs a fresh face.

26:59.735 --> 27:02.970
I appreciate you thinking
about me,

27:03.005 --> 27:04.672
but I'm about to go
on paternity leave

27:04.706 --> 27:06.140
to spend more time
with my family.

27:06.174 --> 27:07.575
Sure, I did some modeling

27:07.609 --> 27:10.044
for Abercrombie & Fitch
back in college,

27:10.078 --> 27:12.880
but I hung up those
cargo pants a long time ago.

27:12.914 --> 27:14.215
Hold on, son.

27:14.249 --> 27:15.883
I'm not talking about doing
some teenage porno here.

27:15.917 --> 27:18.085
Look around!
This is your brother-in-law's

27:18.120 --> 27:19.887
place of business,
and it's empty.

27:19.921 --> 27:22.139
But your creamy skin and

27:22.190 --> 27:25.459
unusually high cheekbones
could change all that.

27:25.494 --> 27:29.297
And if you are taking time off
to help your family,

27:29.331 --> 27:31.666
isn't Chuck your family, too?

27:34.002 --> 27:36.671
I can't believe Casey
sent us out for burritos.

27:36.705 --> 27:38.155
Burritos, Chuck?!

27:38.206 --> 27:40.157
I'm so tired of running errands
for that man's stomach.

27:40.208 --> 27:42.276
Look, Casey means well.

27:42.311 --> 27:44.378
Yeah, but it's not
just Casey, dude, okay?

27:44.413 --> 27:45.680
It's Sarah, too.

27:45.714 --> 27:47.748
What is that supposed to mean?

27:47.783 --> 27:49.333
It just means that
isn't she the one

27:49.384 --> 27:51.502
who told you to be my handler
in the first place?

27:51.553 --> 27:54.188
- Yeah, but...
- Well, did it ever occur to you

27:54.222 --> 27:56.223
that she made you my little
baby-sitter to distract you

27:56.258 --> 27:57.825
from the fact that you're
being sidelined, too?

27:57.859 --> 27:59.493
I don't know if
you noticed, Chief.

27:59.528 --> 28:02.196
You're on a food
run with me.

28:03.231 --> 28:05.599
Look, I'm not...

28:05.634 --> 28:07.501
Look, I love
Sarah, I do, okay?

28:07.536 --> 28:09.904
It's just, I
want to make sure

28:09.938 --> 28:11.972
that she's not the
one handling you.

28:14.576 --> 28:16.577
She's not.

28:18.330 --> 28:21.082
You just passed the exit
for Dos Locos.

28:21.116 --> 28:22.850
Yeah, we're not
going to Dos Locos.

28:22.884 --> 28:25.986
We're going to Karl Sneijder's
corporate headquarters.

28:26.021 --> 28:28.823
Oh, yeah.
Zoomed on a file in Castle.

28:28.857 --> 28:30.224
Oh, did you?

28:30.258 --> 28:31.926
And why didn't you tell anyone?

28:31.960 --> 28:34.362
Why would I, okay?
We're going to take him down.

28:34.396 --> 28:35.930
No. No, no, Bearded Bandit.

28:35.964 --> 28:38.065
No, we are not.
It is far too dangerous.

28:38.100 --> 28:40.000
I'm gonna call Casey and Sarah.
They can help.

28:40.018 --> 28:42.770
They can... They can what? They
can stick us both in the van?

28:42.804 --> 28:44.772
No. Come on, Chuck.
We don't need them.

28:44.806 --> 28:47.208
We're here.

28:47.242 --> 28:49.193
Hey, they don't understand that

28:49.227 --> 28:51.362
you and I are like
Batman and Robin, okay?

28:51.396 --> 28:52.980
Unless you don't want
to be Robin, because

28:53.014 --> 28:54.448
let's face it, who
wants to be Robin?

28:54.483 --> 28:55.683
We'll just be
Batman and Batman.

28:55.717 --> 28:57.318
Either way, we should be
out there saving the day,

28:57.352 --> 28:59.487
not running errands, or
sitting around waiting for

28:59.521 --> 29:00.738
Beckman to get
back to us.

29:00.789 --> 29:01.906
Hey, hey, hey, Morgan, look,

29:01.957 --> 29:03.407
I-I get it.
I know what it feels like

29:03.458 --> 29:05.692
to have the Intersect surging
through you. It makes you

29:05.711 --> 29:06.827
feel like you can do...
Anything.

29:06.861 --> 29:08.579
Yes, yes, anything.

29:08.630 --> 29:09.747
Save the day,
be a hero, anything,

29:09.798 --> 29:11.031
but there's a way.
What are you doing?

29:11.066 --> 29:12.366
Here's the thing, though, Chuck.

29:12.384 --> 29:14.702
You don't need the Intersect
to feel that way, okay?

29:14.736 --> 29:18.339
With or without it, you <i>are</i>
<i>a hero, so don't call them.</i>

29:18.373 --> 29:20.074
All right, we can
handle this together.

29:20.108 --> 29:23.210
Just come with me.

29:23.245 --> 29:25.012
I need you.

29:28.383 --> 29:30.351
Morgan, no, no, no!

29:30.385 --> 29:33.020
God. Aah! Oh!

29:33.054 --> 29:35.906
Okay. Okay. Okay, okay.

29:37.159 --> 29:38.776
Chuck?

29:38.827 --> 29:40.277
Sarah.

29:40.328 --> 29:42.029
Sarah, hey, we're-we're at
Sneijder's headquarters.

29:42.063 --> 29:44.115
What? Don't go in there.

29:44.166 --> 29:46.400
I know, I know, but Morgan just
ran inside, and he's in trouble.

29:46.435 --> 29:48.369
Actually, you know what?
We're both in trouble, because

29:48.403 --> 29:49.970
I'm going after him.
Chuck, no, you can't.

29:50.005 --> 29:52.089
Please just wait for us, okay?
Look, I'm Morgan's handler.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.774
It's my job to take care of him,

29:53.809 --> 29:54.925
which is why I called you,

29:54.960 --> 29:57.278
which is why
I have to go help him now.

29:57.312 --> 29:59.430
You'd do the same for me.

30:01.850 --> 30:03.300
Oh, God.

30:09.747 --> 30:10.947
Chuck's doing a great job,
handling Grimes.

30:12.027 --> 30:13.695
The blind leading
the blind out there.

30:13.713 --> 30:15.831
Well, as long as we get
to Sneijder's headquarters

30:15.865 --> 30:17.365
before something happens.

30:19.235 --> 30:20.602
Casey, what is this?

30:23.072 --> 30:25.474
Your team...

30:25.508 --> 30:27.109
They're at my brother's
building, right?

30:28.711 --> 30:30.579
That place may look
like an ordinary office,

30:30.613 --> 30:32.481
but as soon as Karl realizes
something's up,

30:32.515 --> 30:34.382
he's gonna lock it down
like a fortress.

30:37.120 --> 30:39.221
No one's gonna be able to get in
or out of there alive.

30:52.418 --> 30:54.369
Oh!
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

30:54.403 --> 30:55.637
Oh, you came.
Let's go.

30:55.671 --> 30:57.956
No, no, no, no.
Stop, stop, stop.

30:58.007 --> 30:59.941
Right through that door--
that's Sneijder's office.

30:59.976 --> 31:01.910
Okay, all we have to do is
find proof that he's smuggling

31:01.944 --> 31:03.595
conflict diamonds, dude,
and then we grab him!

31:03.629 --> 31:05.764
What are you talking about?
We have to go right now!

31:05.798 --> 31:07.782
I'm not going anywhere...

31:09.852 --> 31:11.453
No, no, no, no, no, no.

31:11.487 --> 31:13.955
Yes, yes, yes, yes. Listen, you
are the best spy that I know,

31:13.990 --> 31:16.825
and I would rather have nobody
else watching my back, yeah?

31:16.859 --> 31:18.059
Don't worry about it.

31:18.094 --> 31:19.611
I'm gonna take it slow, okay?

31:19.645 --> 31:20.795
Please don't.

31:25.935 --> 31:27.736
Kamikaze!

31:44.720 --> 31:45.921
See? Nothing to it.

31:45.955 --> 31:47.672
It's great.
Very good. Now what?

31:49.959 --> 31:52.260
In the old days, we'd just

call in the commandos for backup
and be done with it.

Look, if you want to work
for Verbanski Corp

31:55.798 --> 31:56.932
and have a fancy DOD contract,

31:56.966 --> 31:58.266

you just go ahead?

31:58.301 --> 31:59.501
I don't want
to work for her.

31:59.535 --> 32:01.486
Look, I saw her Web site
on your computer, okay?

32:01.521 --> 32:02.938
- How much is she offering you?
- Nothing.

32:07.193 --> 32:09.945
The only thing Verbanski's
interested in is me.

32:09.979 --> 32:11.346
Physically.

32:11.380 --> 32:13.314
Sexually.

32:13.332 --> 32:15.000
Whoa, Walker!

32:18.020 --> 32:20.322
Sweep the leg.

32:20.356 --> 32:21.990
Nice.

32:27.496 --> 32:30.098
It was a long time ago.

32:30.132 --> 32:32.367
It only happened once.

32:32.401 --> 32:35.904
Seeing her again makes it...
complicated.

32:35.938 --> 32:38.139
Complicated how?

32:38.174 --> 32:40.675
Well...

32:40.710 --> 32:44.279

someone who just tried

32:44.313 --> 32:46.181
to kill you?

32:46.215 --> 32:47.682
It was incredible.
Okay, I think

32:47.717 --> 32:49.234
we should focus
on the mission now.

Cool.

Let's go get Sneijder.
Wait, no, no, no.

33:34.830 --> 33:36.698
Morgan, we have to get
out of here right now.

33:36.732 --> 33:38.767
Good rule about bad guys:
if there's five to start with,

33:38.801 --> 33:40.735
then there's a hell of a lot
more where that came from.

33:40.753 --> 33:41.736
Chuck...
Da-da-da-da.

33:41.771 --> 33:43.288
Intersect. Handler.

33:43.339 --> 33:45.106
But look what we
did here, man.

33:45.141 --> 33:47.309
Just like I said, right?
Batman and Batman!

33:47.343 --> 33:49.411
Look! Just because you have
the Intersect in you

33:49.445 --> 33:51.446
doesn't mean you don't have
something to learn still.

33:51.480 --> 33:54.248
You have a lot to learn, and I'm not
gonna let you kill yourself today.

33:54.266 --> 33:55.249
I called Casey and Sarah...

33:55.267 --> 33:56.968
What? You called them?

33:57.019 --> 33:58.420
Mr. Carmichael?

34:00.255 --> 34:02.657
I do wish you would have called
before dropping by.

34:07.813 --> 34:09.397
Place is a mess.

34:11.317 --> 34:12.900
So...

34:12.935 --> 34:14.969
did you bring me my brother?

34:16.172 --> 34:18.273
About that...

34:20.659 --> 34:22.476
Hmm...

34:24.130 --> 34:25.446
Wesley was right.

34:25.464 --> 34:26.981
The building's
already in lockdown.

34:27.016 --> 34:28.583
We have to get in there.

34:28.617 --> 34:30.585
Chuck's not answering his phone;
something is wrong...

34:30.619 --> 34:32.187
Can't. Suicide.

34:32.221 --> 34:33.454
But we have to do something.

34:33.472 --> 34:34.922
We're not gonna
get in there now.

34:34.956 --> 34:36.224
Place is a fortress.

34:36.257 --> 34:37.859
The boys are
on their own.

34:37.893 --> 34:39.511
Well, that is not good enough.

34:39.562 --> 34:43.130
I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to get us in there.

34:49.472 --> 34:51.322
Who are you gonna call?

34:51.357 --> 34:53.190
I <i>cannot</i> believe
that you called them.

34:53.242 --> 34:55.944
By the way, I had Sneijder
right where I wanted him.

34:55.978 --> 34:57.412
Morgan, we're not superheroes,

34:57.446 --> 34:58.713
we're not vigilantes,
we're a team.

34:58.748 --> 35:01.315
I thought this one... I thought
this one was you and me.

35:01.333 --> 35:03.685
Why are you so against
Casey and Sarah all of a sudden?

35:03.719 --> 35:05.787
'Cause they-they
don't believe in me,

35:05.821 --> 35:07.522
they don't trust me.
And it's very clear

35:07.556 --> 35:08.957
to me now, neither do you.

35:08.991 --> 35:10.358
Morgan...
Shut up!

35:11.527 --> 35:13.128
I can't listen
to you schoolgirls

35:13.162 --> 35:14.229
babble on anymore.

35:14.263 --> 35:15.563
Come to think of it,

35:15.598 --> 35:18.199
I only need one hostage

35:18.234 --> 35:20.468
to get my brother back.

35:22.238 --> 35:25.240
What's happening?

35:32.848 --> 35:34.849
Oh! Oh, I know what's happening.

35:42.691 --> 35:44.692
Put your weapons down.

35:46.361 --> 35:48.663
I'm sorry, one more time
for clarity,

35:48.697 --> 35:50.565
and then I shoot
something that counts.

35:50.599 --> 35:52.500
Put your weapons down.

35:57.740 --> 36:00.391
I got a couple of buddies
in Moscow who would love

36:00.426 --> 36:04.395
to get you in a tiny, windowless
room for a couple of hours.

36:07.900 --> 36:09.400
You came.

36:09.435 --> 36:11.119
Well, it wasn't cheap.

36:19.662 --> 36:20.945
You know,

36:20.996 --> 36:22.897
some might say
it's tacky

36:22.932 --> 36:24.966
hiring your competition
to help you, but...

36:25.000 --> 36:26.768
I... I think it takes balls.

36:29.338 --> 36:32.240
Oh, and I'll have someone
from our Burbank office

36:32.274 --> 36:33.792
drop off your bill.

36:33.843 --> 36:35.844
We don't have a payment plan.

36:39.515 --> 36:40.932
Always a pleasure, John.

36:45.805 --> 36:47.121
You guys all right?

36:50.326 --> 36:51.776
Yeah. Thank you
so much for coming.

36:51.811 --> 36:53.495
- We really needed you today.
- Yeah, of course.

36:53.529 --> 36:55.446
We're a team.

36:55.481 --> 36:56.831
Hm.

37:10.497 --> 37:11.697
What's with all these people.

37:11.713 --> 37:14.381
Oh, God, do you think
something's wrong?

37:14.855 --> 37:16.188
Just tell me Jeff's not trying

37:16.223 --> 37:19.692
to bathe in
the washing machine again.

37:19.726 --> 37:21.777
So this is more
than just a store.

37:21.811 --> 37:23.195
This is my second home.

37:23.230 --> 37:26.549
It's the 1080-P television
that I watch the big game on.

37:26.583 --> 37:28.751
The waterproof radio that
I listen to in the shower.

37:28.785 --> 37:31.370
It's the industrial blender that
I use to make my protein shakes

37:31.404 --> 37:33.355
that help me look like this
all day long.

37:33.373 --> 37:35.925
It's like his eyes follow
everyone in the store.

37:35.959 --> 37:37.026
So yeah,

37:37.060 --> 37:38.661
I guess for someone like myself,

37:38.695 --> 37:41.096
who's a heart surgeon
and a natural athlete,

37:41.131 --> 37:43.032
why not buy from the best?

37:43.066 --> 37:45.401
Why not Buy More?

37:50.006 --> 37:53.232
Well... I guess we're
in a better financial

37:53.257 --> 37:54.043
situation than we thought.

37:54.044 --> 37:55.945
Plus, Sneijder gave us
200 grand up front.

37:55.979 --> 37:59.114
Yeah, well, we still owe
Verbanski Corp $150,000 of that.

37:59.149 --> 38:00.432
Plus the 30 grand

38:00.483 --> 38:02.418
for the repairs on
Wesley's safe house.

38:02.452 --> 38:04.386
- And the climbing gear.
- The V-21 bolt gun.

38:04.421 --> 38:06.388
Gas for the Lotus.

38:08.074 --> 38:10.058
What? Okay, fine,
I'll cover that.

38:10.076 --> 38:13.095
Hey, it's a start,
and it's what we needed.

38:14.864 --> 38:16.799
