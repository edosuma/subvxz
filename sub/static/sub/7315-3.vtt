You looking for jerry?

00:46.414 --> 00:47.813
Yeah. Registered letter for him.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.515
Mailman brought it late
yesterday afternoon.

00:49.517 --> 00:52.718
Well, give it to me, courtney.
I'll put it in his apartment.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.620
Thanks.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.292
I don't want to be a pain,

01:00.294 --> 01:02.594
But I've still got ants
in my kitchen.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.530
Exterminator's coming
this afternoon.

01:04.532 --> 01:07.499
They'll be done before you

02:05.559 --> 02:09.461
Officially not her desk anymore,
agent dinozzo.

02:10.597 --> 02:11.897
Is gibbs going to replace her?

02:11.899 --> 02:13.899
I don't know.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.901
It's only been a week.

02:15.903 --> 02:18.303
He hasn't really
discussed it with me.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.339
I repeat, murray:

02:20.341 --> 02:21.607
What are you doing?
S.O.P.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.676
Just... Scrubbing
her hard drive.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.757
This kind of
looks like you.
It is.

Hey, tim.

03:06.753 --> 03:08.520
What's the matter?

03:08.522 --> 03:11.723
Can't find my badge and I.D.
Ooh.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.926
Lost your creds--
that's serious.
Yeah, I know, tony.

03:13.928 --> 03:17.262
I couldn't find them at home;
I was hoping I'd left them here.

03:17.264 --> 03:18.730
Ooh, you're so screwed.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.532
Thank god I didn't lose
my building access card.

03:20.534 --> 03:23.869
Lost creds initiate an automatic
I.G. 2b investigation.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.771
It's almost as serious
as losing your weapon.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.372
You didn't lose that,
too, did you?

03:27.374 --> 03:28.574
You keep talking
and I'll use it.

03:28.576 --> 03:30.642
Hey, you've got
to chill out, all right?

03:30.644 --> 03:31.910
No need to report the loss

03:31.912 --> 03:33.545
If they're just gonna
show up, okay?

03:33.547 --> 03:35.614
You just need to think.
Visualize.

03:35.616 --> 03:38.283
When was the last time
you saw them?

03:38.285 --> 03:39.384
Tony, I've tried that.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.453
Explosion. Blew up

Tony:
Casualties?

03:42.456 --> 03:44.523
Yeah, building manager.

03:46.459 --> 03:48.794
You waiting for

Mm-hmm.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.918
Thank you,

04:16.256 --> 04:18.957
The baby-faced newbie cop
is actually checking I.D.'s.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.659
How unusual...

04:20.661 --> 04:22.728
And unfortunate for you.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.435
Special agent anthony dinozzo.

Thank you.

04:53.626 --> 04:55.661
Ah, well done.

04:59.065 --> 05:00.599
Ducky:

05:10.811 --> 05:11.643
But this is breena.

05:11.645 --> 05:12.944

05:12.946 --> 05:14.613
With the adoption lawyer
today, so...

05:14.615 --> 05:15.981
Answer it, mr. Palmer.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.683
Yeah?
Yeah.

05:17.685 --> 05:18.583
Hey, breena.

05:21.688 --> 05:23.955
Adoption lawyer?
They're really gonna do it?

05:23.957 --> 05:26.825
Most certainly, and...
Breena's gonna take a while.

05:26.827 --> 05:28.994
Would you mind
giving me a hand?

05:29.962 --> 05:32.798
Oh. Well...

05:32.800 --> 05:35.367
It's not really my...
Well...

05:35.369 --> 05:37.336
Sure.

05:37.338 --> 05:40.505
One, two, three.
(grunts)

05:42.041 --> 05:44.710
(exhales) yeah, this is
gonna be interesting.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.846
Poor man took the brunt
of the explosion.

05:49.816 --> 05:52.718
Shaped charge.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.787
Meant to kill whoever
opened the door.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.527
Courtney:
I was knocking at the door.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.629
I-I was trying
to give him his mail,

06:04.631 --> 06:07.499
And... I just knew
the lieutenant as a neighbor.

06:07.501 --> 06:09.868
He was a nice guy,
but quiet.

06:09.870 --> 06:12.604
We really didn't talk that much
about anything important.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.673
What can you tell me
about the registered letter?

06:14.675 --> 06:17.142
The letter you signed for.

06:17.144 --> 06:20.045
I'm sorry, but my ears
are still ringing.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.514
Get yourself checked out
at the hospital.

06:22.516 --> 06:25.050
We'll contact you
later, okay?

06:27.687 --> 06:30.021
Spoke with lieutenant keith's
commander at the pentagon.

06:30.023 --> 06:32.824
Keith is on two weeks'
leave visiting his mother

06:32.826 --> 06:34.426
In fort wayne, indiana.

06:34.428 --> 06:37.062
He's away, and somebody
booby-traps his apartment, hmm?

06:37.064 --> 06:38.697
Tony:
<i>Lieutenant junior grade</i>

06:38.699 --> 06:41.933
Terence keith, 26, grew up
in fort wayne, indiana.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.635
Graduated from montana state,

06:43.637 --> 06:46.505
Went to officers' candidate
school in newport, rhode island.

06:46.507 --> 06:47.672
I like rhode island.

06:47.674 --> 06:49.674
He wanted to fly,
but washed out

06:49.676 --> 06:52.511
Of preliminary flight training
at whiting field in florida.

06:52.513 --> 06:54.780
Was assigned to his present duty
at the pentagon last year.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.648
He washed out?
What was his problem?

06:56.650 --> 06:58.717
Checking on it.
Boss, something's wrong.

06:58.719 --> 07:00.619
That was keith's mother
in fort wayne.

07:00.621 --> 07:02.554
He's not there
and she isn't expecting him.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.089
She talk to him?
Not in weeks.

07:15.635 --> 07:17.035
Anything?

07:17.037 --> 07:20.572
Bolo's out on lieutenant
keith's gray '09 pickup.

07:20.574 --> 07:22.107
No action
on his credit card

07:22.109 --> 07:24.609
In the last two days, and his
cell phone is turned off.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.679

07:47.033 --> 07:48.633
Ncis.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.170
She doesn't work here anymore.

07:53.773 --> 07:56.208
I'm sorry, I don't have
a forwarding number.

07:57.844 --> 07:59.211
Sure thing.

08:02.114 --> 08:04.049
Ziva's dental hygienist--
she had an appointment tomorrow.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.917
They were calling
to confirm.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.986
It's hard to believe
she's not coming back.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.688
She wanted to move on.

08:09.690 --> 08:11.256
So let's move on.

08:14.060 --> 08:15.160
Woman:
Hey!

08:15.162 --> 08:16.561
Probie!

08:16.563 --> 08:17.762
Vera.

08:17.764 --> 08:20.198
Am I surprised
to see you here.

08:21.534 --> 08:22.501
(chuckles)
yeah.

08:22.503 --> 08:23.535
I have managed to avoid

08:23.537 --> 08:25.103
Coming to headquarters
for 20 years,

08:25.105 --> 08:26.538
And now they call me in.

08:26.540 --> 08:27.772
I got a meeting
with vance.

08:27.774 --> 08:28.940
I'm already half an hour late.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.076
Is he on this floor?
No. One flight up.

08:31.078 --> 08:32.043
Okay. All right.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.745
It's good to see you, vera.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.247
Good to see you. Boys.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.150
You're looking, uh,
good there, leroy.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.719
(laughs)

08:40.721 --> 08:42.787
We're gonna catch up later.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.593
(sighs)

08:48.595 --> 08:50.762
(quietly):
Yeah.

08:52.665 --> 08:54.065
Who is that, boss?

08:54.067 --> 08:56.234
Uh, special agent
vera strickland.

08:56.236 --> 08:57.602
"probie"?

08:57.604 --> 08:58.603
Mike franks' last partner.

08:58.605 --> 09:00.305
Mcgee, come on,
you're with me.

09:00.307 --> 09:03.608
Pentagon. We're gonna go talk
to lieutenant keith's c.O.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.278
Uh, boss, boss,
abby needs my help.

09:06.280 --> 09:10.081
Actually, she said she needed
my help with the bomb residue.

09:12.151 --> 09:13.685
That okay?

09:17.590 --> 09:19.691
Yeah. Yeah, it's okay.

09:22.962 --> 09:25.163
Did you just lie to
the all-knowing gibbs?

09:25.165 --> 09:27.198
It was stupid, wasn't it?
Yes.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.769
They're not gonna let me into
the pentagon without my creds.

09:30.771 --> 09:33.238
I'm just gonna have to notify
the I.G. And report the loss.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.106
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't make that phone call.

09:35.108 --> 09:37.842
Did you do something
with them, tony?

09:37.844 --> 09:38.877
(chuckles):
No.

09:38.879 --> 09:41.212
No. No.

09:41.214 --> 09:42.914
You probably put them
somewhere stupid.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.616
Where were you last night?

09:44.618 --> 09:46.017
I've been over it
a thousand times.

09:46.019 --> 09:48.787
With your special friend,
d.O.D. Delilah?

09:59.332 --> 10:01.933
What is this?

10:02.902 --> 10:05.971
Hmm. It's hardened.

10:05.973 --> 10:08.273
(sniffs)
whew! Stinks.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.375
What are you mumbling about,
mr. Palmer?

10:10.377 --> 10:13.778
Something's melted
under the fabric. Here, see it?

10:13.780 --> 10:16.181
Well, take it up to abby;
she'll identify it.

10:16.183 --> 10:19.784
(ringtone imitates
old-fashioned car honking)

10:20.753 --> 10:23.054
Ah. Breena texting me.

10:23.056 --> 10:24.255
We had to reschedule

10:24.257 --> 10:26.725
Our appointment
with the adoption lawyer.

10:26.727 --> 10:30.395
His only opening is in...
20 minutes. Great.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.864
I'll have to tell her
I can't make it.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.266
I'll take that up.
You go meet with breena.

10:36.335 --> 10:40.238
Oh... I appreciate that
so much, dr. Mallard.

10:40.240 --> 10:43.274
She's been really nervous about
the whole adoption process.

10:43.276 --> 10:45.143
I'm not nervous;
she's nervous.

10:45.145 --> 10:49.247
Tell her to relax
and think about the end result.

10:49.249 --> 10:50.815
Mr. Palmer,

10:50.817 --> 10:55.220
I... Envy your chance
to have a family.

10:57.056 --> 10:57.922
Go.

11:01.427 --> 11:03.995
(sighs)

11:03.997 --> 11:07.732
(hard rock music blaring)

11:13.305 --> 11:15.340
Abby.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.909
Hang on, this is
my favorite part. Hold on.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.711
♪

11:22.348 --> 11:25.050
(guitar holding chord)

11:25.052 --> 11:27.452
(music ends)

11:27.454 --> 11:30.689
Ah. How good were
the sterile puppets last night?

11:30.691 --> 11:33.191
Yeah, that sound system
at rfk was pretty killer.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.060
Oh, and lynch--
what a great drummer, huh?

11:35.062 --> 11:36.995
Please thank him
for the tickets.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.364
It was so fun being in the pit.
Did you see twitter?

11:39.366 --> 11:41.099
The puppets have been trending
since the concert.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.400
That's nice.

11:44.003 --> 11:46.337
What's wrong?

11:46.339 --> 11:48.073
I lost my badge and I.D.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.941
Oh, oh...

11:49.943 --> 11:51.376
Ouch.

11:51.378 --> 11:53.211
Yeah. Might have been
during the concert,

11:53.213 --> 11:54.813
All that bumping and shoving.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.247
Oh, god, I hope not.

11:56.249 --> 11:57.315
What did gibbs say?

11:57.317 --> 11:59.451
I haven't told him.

11:59.453 --> 12:02.020
Abby, what if I
was pickpocketed?

12:06.258 --> 12:07.726
What's this?

12:07.728 --> 12:10.462
It's ziva's scarf.

12:10.464 --> 12:12.130
Oh, yeah.

12:13.399 --> 12:14.933
I remember this.

12:14.935 --> 12:17.102
She wore it
her first day at ncis.

12:17.104 --> 12:21.306
I complimented her on it,
and she just gave it to me.

12:21.308 --> 12:24.109
And I wore it today,
and it just made me feel better.

12:24.111 --> 12:25.243
So maybe that'll work for you.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.478
Mm.

12:26.480 --> 12:28.246
Have you talked to her?

12:28.248 --> 12:30.348
Texted her.
I haven't heard back.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.318
Oh, the good doctor.

12:33.320 --> 12:35.487
What dost thou
bringeth me?

12:35.489 --> 12:38.490
The vestments
of the newly departed, milady.

12:38.492 --> 12:42.360
The heat of the explosion
fused something onto his shirt.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.395
It looks like... Plastic?

12:44.397 --> 12:47.098
Ooh.
Maybe a credit card?
I'll check.

12:47.100 --> 12:49.367
Any luck with the bomb?
Abby: I was able
to determine

12:49.369 --> 12:51.836
That the explosive was c-4.

12:51.838 --> 12:54.105
And based on the size
of the blast,

12:54.107 --> 12:56.908
I'd think it was probably
ten to 12 ounces.

12:56.910 --> 12:59.210
That would explain
the extensive trauma

12:59.212 --> 13:01.179
To the building
manager's body.

13:01.181 --> 13:03.782
Any luck locating
the lieutenant, agent mcgee?

13:03.784 --> 13:05.083
Unfortunately, no.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.417
I don't believe

13:06.419 --> 13:09.420
I've ever seen you
wearing a scarf before.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.260
Man: <i>I'm confused.</i>
<i>Keith isn't in fort wayne?</i>

13:15.262 --> 13:16.928
His mother hasn't seen
or talked to him

13:16.930 --> 13:18.263
In weeks-- she
isn't expecting him.

13:18.265 --> 13:20.832
I don't know what to
tell you, agent gibbs.

13:20.834 --> 13:22.200
Why would he lie?

13:22.202 --> 13:24.135
I don't know.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.372
Anything at work
that could put him in danger?

13:27.374 --> 13:29.407
No. His duties are
primarily administrative.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.376
He doesn't have
top-secret clearance.

13:31.378 --> 13:34.379
I can't believe
someone would try to kill him.

13:34.381 --> 13:36.447
He's quiet, keeps to himself.

13:36.449 --> 13:38.216
What can you tell me about

13:38.218 --> 13:40.051
Lieutenant keith's
personal life?
Not much.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.487
Matter of fact, I don't
think I've ever seen him
outside the office.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.490
Is he good at his job?
Adequate.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.292
He doesn't have
his heart in it.

13:47.294 --> 13:48.927
Once keith washed out
of flight school,

13:48.929 --> 13:50.862
I think he was just
riding his time out.

13:50.864 --> 13:53.398
Offered him a job that would
put him on a career track,

13:53.400 --> 13:54.432
But he wasn't interested.

13:54.434 --> 13:56.301
He give a reason?
No.

13:56.303 --> 13:57.869
He's a strange duck.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.337
How do you mean?

13:59.339 --> 14:02.207
I just... Can't get
a handle on the guy.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.608
Vera:
<i>So this is mtac.</i>

14:03.610 --> 14:05.543
Mm-hmm.

14:05.545 --> 14:08.313
Vera, I've seen your face
on that screen

14:08.315 --> 14:10.181
More times than
I can remember.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.417
Wow, I didn't realize
it was so big.

14:12.419 --> 14:14.853
Must've shown every
wrinkle on my mug.

14:14.855 --> 14:18.056
You got to give
a girl a break.
(laughs)

14:27.967 --> 14:29.467
Mcgee?

14:30.436 --> 14:32.103
What are you doing?

14:33.072 --> 14:34.472
Uh...

14:38.444 --> 14:40.912
I can't find my car key.

14:40.914 --> 14:44.282
And, uh, I thought
I dropped it in here.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.517
Mcgee, I'd like to introduce
you to special agent
vera strickland.

14:46.519 --> 14:48.486
Oh, well, we sort of
already met, leon.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.054
He's one of gibbs' kids, right?

14:50.056 --> 14:51.956
Vance: Right. Vera's retiring
at the end of the month.

14:51.958 --> 14:53.958
She's gonna be here
with us at headquarters

14:53.960 --> 14:57.028
For the last couple of weeks
as she processes out.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.097
Where alls I have to do
is keep my nose clean,

14:59.099 --> 15:00.365
Stay out of trouble,

15:00.367 --> 15:02.500
And then I ride off
into the sunset on my hog.

15:02.502 --> 15:03.601
Vance:
She's not kidding.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.069
Vera's got a harley.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.138
V-twin, four-stroke,
electra glide classic.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.406
(both chuckle)

15:08.408 --> 15:13.645
Who?
Well, I want to tell gibbs
myself. Where is he?

15:13.647 --> 15:16.180
He went to the pentagon.

15:16.182 --> 15:18.316
Abbs?

15:18.318 --> 15:21.286
(line ringing)
you can tell me;
we are a team.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.087
Gibbs, gibbs, gibbs!
I got a fingerprint

15:23.089 --> 15:25.156
And dna off the bomb's
trigger mechanism.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.225
And I ran it through
a database of one,

15:27.227 --> 15:28.626
And I got a name.
Abbs?

15:28.628 --> 15:30.061
Who?

15:30.063 --> 15:32.697
Lieutenant junior grade
terence keith.

15:32.699 --> 15:34.065
(phone beeps)

15:35.301 --> 15:36.701
He blew up his own apartment.

15:36.703 --> 15:40.038
Why would keith booby-trap
his own apartment?

15:51.016 --> 15:53.151
Looks like lieutenant keith
called the same number

15:53.153 --> 15:54.953
Several times
over the past few days.

15:54.955 --> 15:58.189
Belongs to a lieutenant
junior grade dana robbins,

15:58.191 --> 15:59.490
An aviator.

15:59.492 --> 16:01.359
Assigned to the carrier
benjamin franklin.

16:01.361 --> 16:03.328
It's home-ported in norfolk.

16:03.330 --> 16:04.562
She only answered
the first call.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.230
Talked for less than
three minutes.

16:06.232 --> 16:08.399
She's not aboard the ship;
I left a message.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.635
I've been talking to people
in fort wayne about keith.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.337
Not exactly
an ideal childhood.

16:12.339 --> 16:14.038
Father left
when he was six.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.139
He was an alcoholic.

16:15.141 --> 16:16.374
They haven't had
much contact since.

16:16.376 --> 16:19.143
Keith was a nerd
in high school.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.079
Science geek.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.481
Captain laramie hinted
he was a little strange.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.150
Yeah. High school advisor said
he was a loner, bullied.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.252
Nose got broken
his senior year.

16:28.254 --> 16:29.654
Lot of wedgies.
Probably why he went

16:29.656 --> 16:31.489
Out of state to college,
to get away.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.291
Doesn't sound like
officer candidate material.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.492
Vera:
Found the break room.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.362
The coffee sucks.

16:37.364 --> 16:39.530
Director vance said there was
an empty desk around here

16:39.532 --> 16:41.165
Where I could
park my ass.

16:41.167 --> 16:42.367
This will do.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.434
No.
Not that one.

16:43.436 --> 16:44.369
Okay.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.371
What's the problem, boys?

16:46.373 --> 16:47.739
Vera, come on.

16:47.741 --> 16:49.440
Got a desk for you.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.175
All right.

16:53.712 --> 16:55.613
Oh... Well...

16:55.615 --> 16:57.615
Well, it's a
little cramped.

16:57.617 --> 16:59.384
Gibbs:
No. It's cozy.
Yeah, well,

16:59.386 --> 17:02.020
What the hell, it's just
till the end of the month.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.188
(loudly): And you're not
even gonna know I'm here.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.090
(phone ringing)

17:06.092 --> 17:08.026
(tony groans)

17:08.028 --> 17:09.293
(whispers):
No, boss.

17:09.295 --> 17:11.329
Back to work.

17:11.331 --> 17:12.563
Abby:
Gibbs, can you come to the lab?

17:12.565 --> 17:14.599
Yeah, abbs.
I'm on my way down.

17:24.676 --> 17:25.676
(elevator bell dings)

17:25.678 --> 17:27.412
Through the loop.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.447
Round.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.716
Back through the loop.

17:31.718 --> 17:33.751
Are you knitting?

17:33.753 --> 17:35.553
I'm trying.

17:35.555 --> 17:38.122
They're gonna be booties
for jimmy and breena's baby.

17:38.124 --> 17:39.424
That's months away, abbs.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.592
Well, it's gonna
take me that long.

17:41.594 --> 17:44.062
This can't be the reason
you brought me down here.

17:44.064 --> 17:45.063
We got lucky.

17:45.065 --> 17:46.697
Major mass spec determined

17:46.699 --> 17:49.133
The specific signature
on the c-4.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.436
It's a unique combination
of a plasticizer

17:51.438 --> 17:53.271
And dinitrobutane.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.440
It's manufactured by a
company in des moines, iowa.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.442
Why are we lucky?
I'm so glad you asked.

17:57.444 --> 18:00.445
They only have one distributor
in the mid-atlantic states:

18:00.447 --> 18:02.313
Pyrotechnic engineering.

18:02.315 --> 18:05.583
And they are just across
the river in anacostia.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.618
You get anything
from keith's laptop?

18:07.620 --> 18:10.188
Oh. Have no fear.

18:10.190 --> 18:13.458
I  <i>will</i>access
this hard drive.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.626
Boss, it's unbelievable--
she and mike franks

18:15.628 --> 18:18.529
Were involved in the capture
of noriega in panama?

18:18.531 --> 18:20.465
Mcgee: Yeah, he sought asylum
at the vatican embassy.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.400
It was vera's idea
to blast him out

18:22.402 --> 18:26.204
It's ancient history, boys;
I've heard it a thousand times.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.405
What about our current case?

18:27.407 --> 18:29.607
Work, work, work.
Gibbs used to be fun.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.309
You connect
with the pilot

18:31.311 --> 18:32.477
Keith was trying to call?

18:32.479 --> 18:34.345
Lieutenant robbins
is on her way here.

18:34.347 --> 18:35.746
His college transcripts
just came in.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.548
It's interesting--
his major was

18:37.550 --> 18:40.118
Electronic engineering,
which would give him

18:40.120 --> 18:42.286
The technical know-how
to make a bomb.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.521
Yeah, abby I.D.'d the explosive.

18:43.523 --> 18:44.889
It was distributed

18:44.891 --> 18:47.558
By pyrotechnic engineering
in anacostia.

18:47.560 --> 18:50.394
You two, go,
check it out.

19:02.174 --> 19:03.574
Boss, I got a problem.

19:03.576 --> 19:05.576
I lost my creds.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.311
I haven't seen them
since last night.

19:07.313 --> 19:08.646
You're just telling me now?

19:11.350 --> 19:12.750
You report this to our I.G.?

19:12.752 --> 19:14.552
I wanted to tell you first.

19:16.421 --> 19:18.389
I'll notify them.

19:20.926 --> 19:22.760
Special agent strickland.

19:22.762 --> 19:24.529
Yeah?
Gear up.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.264
What?

19:26.266 --> 19:28.299
Vance said you're available
if needed.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.301
Vera:
Uh, uh-uh, no way.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.769
No, no, no.
I'm just here to...
Vera...

19:31.771 --> 19:33.237
To process out.
Vera.

19:33.239 --> 19:34.605
That's-- no...
Go with dinozzo.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.474
(quietly):
Dinozzo?

19:36.476 --> 19:38.376
Oh, I've heard stories
about this guy.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.678
His car blew up,
he almost died from the plague.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.713
And didn't someone shoot
at you a few months ago?

19:42.715 --> 19:44.515
He missed.
(groans)

19:44.517 --> 19:46.717
I only have two
weeks left, gibbs.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.753
I shouldn't even be
in the same room

19:48.755 --> 19:50.922
As this moving target.
Go.

19:52.724 --> 19:54.392
(sighs)

19:57.429 --> 19:59.430
This is your fault, mcgee.

19:59.432 --> 20:00.665
You're gonna pay.

20:06.505 --> 20:09.574
Tony: So, tell me, vera, how do
you like working with a partner?

20:09.576 --> 20:12.243
You want to
"good cop/bad cop"?

20:12.245 --> 20:15.646
You, inspector clouseau, are
an accident waiting to happen.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.716
And you are definitely
not my partner.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.619
So, how did you work
with mike franks, then?

20:21.621 --> 20:23.521
We had a very special
relationship.

20:23.523 --> 20:24.822
Really? How so?

20:24.824 --> 20:26.691
Yeah, I'm not
going into it, dinozzo.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.694
Okay? This is your show;
I'm here for the ride.

20:29.696 --> 20:32.763
Speaking of ride,
I don't like the way you drive.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.472
Mr. Frazier?
Yeah?

20:41.474 --> 20:44.475
Special agent dinozzo.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.710
Special agent strickland.

20:45.712 --> 20:48.346
What can I do for you?
Have you seen this guy?

20:48.348 --> 20:49.647
Yeah.

20:49.649 --> 20:50.848
Yeah. He was here.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.016
Couple of weeks ago.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.751
Wanted to buy some c-4.

20:53.753 --> 20:55.253
He's in the navy?

20:55.255 --> 20:56.520
Yeah.
Yeah. Uh, did you

20:56.522 --> 20:57.788
Sell him the plastic?
No, no.

20:57.790 --> 21:01.592
Did...
The lieutenant tell you
what he wanted to do with it?

21:01.594 --> 21:03.427
He said he just
needed a pound or two

21:03.429 --> 21:04.562
To blast some tree stumps.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.297
So he left empty-handed?
Yeah.

21:06.299 --> 21:09.867
Of a demolitions contractor
who might take a small job.

21:09.869 --> 21:11.302
The powder monkey
got a name?

21:11.304 --> 21:13.437
Yeah, yeah.
Larry purcell.

21:13.439 --> 21:14.939
Works out of his
house in elkridge.

21:14.941 --> 21:17.608
You got any questions, dinozzo?

21:17.610 --> 21:19.343
<i>Moi?</i>

21:19.345 --> 21:21.579
Don't even know why I'm here.

21:21.581 --> 21:23.281
Thanks.

21:28.353 --> 21:29.687
(door opens)

21:29.689 --> 21:30.921
Gibbs:
Lieutenant robbins.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.990
Thanks for coming in.
Have a seat.

21:33.892 --> 21:35.393
You want some coffee?

21:35.395 --> 21:36.661
Sure, thank you.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.462
I'll try to make this
as quick as possible.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.664
I know you're deploying
in the morning.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.032
You must be excited.
I am.

21:41.034 --> 21:42.800
I've been training for this
a long time.

21:42.802 --> 21:45.303
F-18?
Yes, sir.

21:45.305 --> 21:47.805
I get paid to fly a super
hornet-- doesn't get
any better than that.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.674
That's great.

21:49.676 --> 21:52.376
Special agent mcgee didn't
tell me what this is about.

21:52.378 --> 21:54.478
Lieutenant j.G. Terence keith.

21:54.480 --> 21:55.746
Terry?

21:55.748 --> 21:57.081
Yeah. You talk
to him recently?

21:57.083 --> 21:58.316
Couple days ago.

21:58.318 --> 21:59.817
Is something wrong?

21:59.819 --> 22:01.652
We can't find him.

22:01.654 --> 22:02.953
He in some kind of trouble?

22:02.955 --> 22:04.722
How do you know him?

22:04.724 --> 22:07.491
Um, met him in pensacola
for a.P.I.

22:07.493 --> 22:09.327
We moved on together
to whiting field

22:09.329 --> 22:10.728
For preliminary
flight training.

22:10.730 --> 22:12.596
You two close?

22:12.598 --> 22:16.000
No. Just... Classmates.

22:16.968 --> 22:18.903
Why'd he wash out?

22:20.405 --> 22:22.506
He was actually a good pilot.

22:22.508 --> 22:23.974
The pressure got to him.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.910
Pressure, huh?

22:27.779 --> 22:29.013
Terry probably needed to be

22:29.015 --> 22:31.015
On some kind of
antianxiety medication.

22:31.017 --> 22:33.451
But you can't
do that and fly.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.820
He started acting out.

22:35.822 --> 22:37.988
There a confrontation?

22:37.990 --> 22:39.790
No.

22:39.792 --> 22:41.792
In the last few weeks
of flight training,

22:41.794 --> 22:43.794
Terry knew he wasn't
gonna make the cut.

22:43.796 --> 22:45.830
He became sullen and withdrawn.

22:47.432 --> 22:49.667
And angry with me.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.103
I don't think he could
accept the fact that a woman

22:52.105 --> 22:54.939
Was going to move on to strike
jet training and he wasn't.

22:54.941 --> 22:58.509
The call the other day--
what'd he want?

22:58.511 --> 23:00.811
Couldn't figure it out.
It was strange.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.813
He was... Strange.

23:02.815 --> 23:05.716
We weren't on the best of terms
when he left whiting field,

23:05.718 --> 23:08.452
And... Now he wants
to see me before I deploy.

23:08.454 --> 23:10.388
What'd you tell him?

23:10.390 --> 23:12.456
That I was busy.

23:12.458 --> 23:15.559
I needed to see friends and
family before I shipped out.

23:24.436 --> 23:26.670
Why don't you handle
this one, dinozzo.

23:26.672 --> 23:28.739
(chuckles)
okay.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.150
Hey there.

23:39.152 --> 23:40.918
You larry purcell?

23:40.920 --> 23:42.653
Who's asking?

23:42.655 --> 23:45.589
Ncis special agent dinozzo,

23:45.591 --> 23:46.757
And company.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.192
You a navy cop?
Yeah.

23:48.194 --> 23:50.628
You know the lieutenant?

23:50.630 --> 23:52.763
No.
You didn't look
at the picture, larry.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.799
Why don't you try
looking at the picture.

23:55.867 --> 23:58.969
Yeah, maybe he was here
a couple weeks ago.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.638
You help him
remove a tree stump?

24:00.640 --> 24:01.906
What? No.

24:01.908 --> 24:04.041
I'm betting you sold him
some c-4.

24:04.043 --> 24:05.976
I don't know. Maybe.

24:05.978 --> 24:07.812
Yeah.
(chuckles)

24:07.814 --> 24:10.481
I have to check my records.
What'd you say his name was?

24:10.483 --> 24:13.017
I didn't.
Try terence keith.

24:13.019 --> 24:15.519
I'll be back.

24:15.521 --> 24:17.154
Thanks, larry.

24:17.156 --> 24:19.690
(quietly):
Squirrely dude.

24:20.659 --> 24:21.659
Hmm.

24:21.661 --> 24:22.793
(sighs)

24:24.062 --> 24:26.697
Vera:
Nice.

24:28.066 --> 24:29.767
(engine starts)

24:31.169 --> 24:33.003
Tony:
Vera!
(screams)

24:42.180 --> 24:44.248
(groaning)

24:44.250 --> 24:46.717
(dog barking in distance)

24:49.087 --> 24:50.888
(panting)

25:01.500 --> 25:03.901
I had a good job with
a contractor up north,

25:03.903 --> 25:05.636
But I got laid off.

25:05.638 --> 25:08.639
I couldn't find anything steady,
so I started doing odd jobs.

25:08.641 --> 25:11.175
(chuckles) I needed
the money, okay?

25:11.177 --> 25:12.877
So you sold
lieutenant keith the c-4.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.612
He never told
me his name,

25:14.614 --> 25:16.814
And I didn't know
he was in the navy.

25:16.816 --> 25:18.883
Gibbs: What'd you think he was
gonna do with explosives?

25:18.885 --> 25:20.551
He said he
was gonna do

25:20.553 --> 25:21.986
Some demo work
on a friend's farm.

25:21.988 --> 25:23.521
And you believed him?

25:23.523 --> 25:25.723
I believed the cash he gave me.

25:25.725 --> 25:29.727
I had no idea he was gonna rig
his apartment and kill somebody.

25:30.695 --> 25:32.563
(door opens)

25:35.734 --> 25:37.067
(grunts)

25:37.069 --> 25:39.003
A little help would
be nice, mcgee.

25:39.005 --> 25:41.572
Sorry.

25:43.808 --> 25:45.843
Is it broken?

25:45.845 --> 25:47.845
A severe ankle sprain.

25:47.847 --> 25:48.979
You're lucky.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.047
Lucky?

25:50.049 --> 25:52.049
Purcell:
What happens now?

25:52.051 --> 25:53.884
Tony: You're gonna be held
in a detention facility

25:53.886 --> 25:55.586
And booked
for accessory to murder,

25:55.588 --> 25:56.921
Illegal sale of explosives,

25:56.923 --> 25:59.256
And assaulting
two federal officers.

25:59.258 --> 26:02.059
<i>Two</i> federal officers?
Yeah.

26:02.061 --> 26:04.762
Me and agent strickland.
That old broad is an agent?

26:06.731 --> 26:09.133
I just need one minute
with that clown.

26:11.202 --> 26:13.604
Purcell:
Can I make some kind of a deal?

26:13.606 --> 26:14.939
Unless you can tell us
where keith is,

26:14.941 --> 26:17.841
Do I get a break
if I sign a confession?

26:19.978 --> 26:21.245
Write it all down.

26:21.247 --> 26:22.746
Tony:
And please be specific.

26:22.748 --> 26:24.848
We estimate he used
ten to 12 ounces of c-4.

26:24.850 --> 26:26.150
How much did you sell him?

26:26.152 --> 26:27.785
Ounces?

26:27.787 --> 26:29.954
I sold him 200 pounds.

26:32.691 --> 26:35.292
That's almost as much c-4
as was used to take out

26:35.294 --> 26:36.727
The    <i>co</i>in yemen.

26:36.729 --> 26:38.062
Gibbs, what are
we dealing with?

26:38.064 --> 26:39.697
Keith has something
big planned.

26:39.699 --> 26:41.765
Agreed, but why did he rig
his own apartment?

26:41.767 --> 26:42.933
Whoever comes
to investigate

26:42.935 --> 26:44.735
After the fact--
take him out, leon.

26:44.737 --> 26:46.203
Wouldn't be
the first time.

26:46.205 --> 26:47.972
Keith didn't know
that the building manager

26:47.974 --> 26:49.940
Was gonna open
that door prematurely.

26:49.942 --> 26:53.844
Gibbs, what-what's
his ultimate target?

26:53.846 --> 26:55.379
I don't know.

26:55.381 --> 26:58.782
I got to notify homeland,
fbi and the atf.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.218
Abby: <i>So, gibbs,</i>
<i>your golden gut was right.</i>

27:01.220 --> 27:03.821
I finally got into
keith's hard drive.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.723
For the last year,
he's been buying

27:05.725 --> 27:07.291
Prescription
antidepressants online

27:07.293 --> 27:09.893
From a canadian pharmacy
using an assumed name.

27:09.895 --> 27:11.195
Self-medicating.
And also,

27:11.197 --> 27:13.864
This, um, plastic blob
that was melted

27:13.866 --> 27:15.332
On the apartment
manager's shirt,

27:15.334 --> 27:17.101
It is not a
credit card.

27:17.103 --> 27:21.238
It is actually an faa
private pilot's license.

27:21.240 --> 27:22.940
Newly issued and sent
by registered mail

27:22.942 --> 27:25.075
To lieutenant keith
two days ago.

27:25.077 --> 27:27.878
The letter the manager was
gonna put in keith's apartment.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.013
No good deed
goes unpunished.

27:29.015 --> 27:30.714
Lieutenant keith

27:30.716 --> 27:33.651
Took his final check ride
for a civilian pilot's license

27:33.653 --> 27:36.186
Two weeks ago at a small airport
in rural virginia,

27:36.188 --> 27:37.788
Lafayette field.

27:37.790 --> 27:39.957
His instructor was kip logan.

27:39.959 --> 27:43.394
On my way, boss.
Want to take a ride, vera?

27:43.396 --> 27:44.928
Bite me.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.869
Keith was the best student
I ever had.

27:51.871 --> 27:53.704
Didn't have
to teach him anything.

27:53.706 --> 27:55.339
The navy did that.

27:55.341 --> 27:57.174
Qualifying him
was a no-brainer.

27:57.176 --> 28:00.978
Once he passed the written exam
and logged the minimum hours,

28:00.980 --> 28:02.346
I issued him
a temporary certificate

28:02.348 --> 28:04.114
And filed the paperwork
with the faa.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.816
Seen him recently?
Yesterday afternoon.

28:05.818 --> 28:07.718
Checked him out
in a stol he wanted to rent.

28:07.720 --> 28:09.687
Stol? What's that?
S-t-o-l.

28:09.689 --> 28:10.954
Short take-off and landing.

28:10.956 --> 28:12.990
Two-seater.
Lot of fun to fly.

28:12.992 --> 28:15.192
You can land them anywhere--
pasture, field.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.827
It's great
for cross-country trips.

28:16.829 --> 28:19.363
Did he rent it?
Yeah. He booked it for two days.

28:19.365 --> 28:20.998
He say where he was going?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.266
Didn't tell me.

28:23.735 --> 28:25.903
♪

28:50.328 --> 28:52.863
Woman: <i>We pulled the radar</i>
<i>and security footage</i>

28:52.865 --> 28:55.099
From lafayette field
for yesterday afternoon.

28:55.101 --> 28:59.103
The plane lieutenant keith
rented took off at 1421.

28:59.105 --> 29:00.904
It circled the field,

29:00.906 --> 29:02.940
Then headed
in a southwesterly direction.

29:02.942 --> 29:05.943
Three minutes later,
it dropped below radar coverage.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.946
Did it ever pop up
on the radar again?

29:08.948 --> 29:13.350
No. A stol has the capability
to fly very low and very slow.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.886
It'd be like finding
a needle in a haystack.

29:15.888 --> 29:16.954
So potentially,

29:16.956 --> 29:18.922
We have a bomb
aboard an airplane

29:18.924 --> 29:21.525
On a suicide mission
with an unknown target.

29:27.432 --> 29:29.366
Alert all agents and analysts:

29:29.368 --> 29:32.136
No one leaves until we
find lieutenant keith.

29:45.850 --> 29:47.351
Thank you, sweetheart.

29:47.353 --> 29:50.053
You have just made my day.

29:50.055 --> 29:52.022
I'm out of here!

29:52.024 --> 29:54.158
Oh, that was h.R.,

29:54.160 --> 29:56.860
And because of my
line-of-duty injury,

29:56.862 --> 29:58.929
I don't have to come in anymore.

30:00.031 --> 30:02.933
And I have you to thank
for that, dinozzo.

30:02.935 --> 30:04.868
Well, it was
my pleasure.

30:04.870 --> 30:06.370
Oh!
Here let me help
you with...

30:06.372 --> 30:08.305
No, don't. Back. Back.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.840
Don't you come near me.

30:09.842 --> 30:13.043
Just a...
Back. I said back.

30:14.913 --> 30:16.947
(sighs)
you catch that s.O.B.

30:16.949 --> 30:18.882
Before he hurts

30:18.884 --> 30:20.117
Anybody else, probie.

30:20.119 --> 30:21.985
We'll see you around, vera.

30:21.987 --> 30:25.355
You know, I'm gonna have
a lot of time on my hands.

30:25.357 --> 30:26.557
Maybe I'll drop by,

30:26.559 --> 30:28.258
See what you're working on
in the basement.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.260
Front door

30:30.262 --> 30:31.195
Still unlocked?

30:34.399 --> 30:36.200
Just put it around...
No. I said no.

30:36.202 --> 30:38.202
Don't touch me. Back off!

30:38.204 --> 30:40.337
Gibbs: Come on,
come on, come on.

30:40.339 --> 30:42.005
Back to work.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.841
Keith took off 48 hours ago.

30:43.843 --> 30:44.842
Where is he?

30:44.844 --> 30:47.010
Call you next week?
Yes, boss.

30:47.012 --> 30:49.346
Gibbs: ...Stationed at lafayette
field in case he returns there.

30:49.348 --> 30:51.582
Tony: He's not going
back there, trust me.

30:51.584 --> 30:54.618
Is this what you
lost, mcgee?

30:54.620 --> 30:56.253
Where'd you find them, director?

30:56.255 --> 30:59.456
They were found
at rfk stadium.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.425
Police turned them in
to the I.G.'s office.

31:01.427 --> 31:03.026
I don't know what to say.

31:03.028 --> 31:04.161
Gibbs, you know
about this?

31:04.163 --> 31:05.295
Yeah. I'll deal
with it later.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.231
Been a little busy
around here, leon.

31:10.201 --> 31:12.035
Anything on
lieutenant keith?

31:12.037 --> 31:13.170
No, nothing on his location.

31:13.172 --> 31:15.505
Ducky profiled him;
we have a theory.

31:15.507 --> 31:17.007
All right, let's go.

31:17.009 --> 31:19.409
We're briefing the
others in five minutes.

31:20.378 --> 31:22.479
Duck. Yeah, I need you in mtac.

31:22.481 --> 31:25.115
Told you you'd find 'em.

31:25.117 --> 31:27.517
Yeah, in the inspector
general's office.

31:27.519 --> 31:29.586
Ooh.
I'm completely screwed.

31:30.455 --> 31:32.556
Well.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.157
Air traffic controllers
are on full alert.

31:34.159 --> 31:35.425
We haven't had
any sightings.

31:35.427 --> 31:36.994
What's the plane's range?

31:36.996 --> 31:39.196
Bergin:
Just under 450 nautical miles.

31:39.198 --> 31:41.031
So if keith is planning
to go any further,

31:41.033 --> 31:42.432
He'll have to stop to refuel.

31:42.434 --> 31:44.968
All general aviation airports
east of the mississippi

31:44.970 --> 31:48.071
And what do we know
about lieutenant keith?

31:48.073 --> 31:50.073
We've profiled him.
Dr. Mallard?

31:50.075 --> 31:53.176
Lieutenant keith
was bullied as a youth

31:53.178 --> 31:56.313
And looked to naval aviation
to turn his life around.

31:56.315 --> 31:58.081
Unfortunately, he washed out.

31:58.083 --> 31:59.917
That made him depressed.

31:59.919 --> 32:02.052
And rather than seeking
professional help,

32:02.054 --> 32:04.054
He self-medicated.

32:04.056 --> 32:06.123
We believe that he quit,
cold-turkey,

32:06.125 --> 32:09.326
To pass his faa medical
exam, and to get his

32:09.328 --> 32:10.427
Civilian pilot's license.

32:10.429 --> 32:12.129
An abrupt cessation
of medication

32:12.131 --> 32:14.932
Of that type
could most definitely lead

32:14.934 --> 32:18.035
To episodes
of delusion and paranoia.

32:18.037 --> 32:19.636
That altered state,

32:19.638 --> 32:22.572
Combined with low self-esteem
and rejection--

32:22.574 --> 32:25.642
Well, most likely
he's seeking revenge.

32:25.644 --> 32:27.945
Revenge against whom?

32:27.947 --> 32:29.146
We're aware
of two possibilities:

32:29.148 --> 32:30.614
The high school,
where he was bullied,

32:30.616 --> 32:32.282
Or whiting field,
where he washed out.

32:32.284 --> 32:33.650
And both have been alerted.

32:33.652 --> 32:36.086
We can't limit ourselves
to those two targets.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.354
Could be anywhere.

32:48.099 --> 32:50.200
So, how'd it go
with the adoption lawyer?

32:50.202 --> 32:55.372
He had a problem with one
of the items on our résumé.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.107
What?

32:57.109 --> 32:59.142
Well, breena's a mortician;
I'm a medical examiner--

32:59.144 --> 33:01.144
We both work with
dead people-- and, uh,

33:01.146 --> 33:04.548
The lawyer seemed to think that
that might be kind of a turn-off

33:04.550 --> 33:07.617
For a young woman putting
her baby up for adoption.

33:07.619 --> 33:10.487
But, uh, you know,
I think it'll be fine.

33:10.489 --> 33:14.758
You should be, because as soon
as they get to know you two,

33:14.760 --> 33:16.093
They're gonna love you.

33:16.095 --> 33:17.194
Thank you for saying that.

33:17.196 --> 33:18.261
(elevator bell dings)

33:18.263 --> 33:19.463
Hey, mcgee.

33:19.465 --> 33:21.631
Abby: Hey, mcgee.
Well, I got my creds back.

33:21.633 --> 33:23.767
Great!
Where were they?

33:23.769 --> 33:25.235
Someone found them at rfk.

33:25.237 --> 33:28.138
I.G. Investigation
to follow.

33:28.140 --> 33:30.674
I could end up
getting time on the beach.

33:30.676 --> 33:32.009
Or worse.

33:32.011 --> 33:35.412
Mcgee, oh,
I'm so, so, so sorry.

33:36.647 --> 33:38.281
(groans)
I feel totally responsible.

33:38.283 --> 33:41.018
I begged you to go
to that concert with me.

33:41.020 --> 33:42.519
Abby, it's not your fault.
Oh, god.

33:42.521 --> 33:45.322
Now it's just ruined what
would have gone down in history

33:45.324 --> 33:47.324
As   <i>th</i>most epic night ever.

33:47.326 --> 33:48.658
Have you seen twitter?

33:48.660 --> 33:51.061
The sterile puppets
have now gone viral.

33:51.063 --> 33:53.363
Oh, yeah. I heard they passed
one million followers.

33:55.566 --> 33:56.800
What?

33:56.802 --> 33:59.636
How good a friend of yours
is the drummer?

33:59.638 --> 34:01.705
Why?

34:01.707 --> 34:03.206
Think he'd do you a favor?

34:05.243 --> 34:06.710
Will you slow down, mcgee?

34:06.712 --> 34:09.379
I do not understand
a word you are saying.

34:09.381 --> 34:10.714
In english.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.682
There's a way
of finding the plane

34:12.684 --> 34:14.384
If it's flying
under the radar.

34:14.386 --> 34:15.752
Social networking,
gibbs. Twitter.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.354
Abby's got a friend
who's in a band.

34:17.356 --> 34:18.722
And right now,
every single one

34:18.724 --> 34:20.090
Of their tweets
is being followed

34:20.092 --> 34:21.691
By hundreds of
thousands of fans.

34:21.693 --> 34:25.095
And ask the group's fans
to be on the lookout.

34:25.097 --> 34:26.430
And if anyone sees it,

34:26.432 --> 34:28.331
Then we tell them
to tweet the location

34:28.333 --> 34:29.666
With the hashtag
"findthisplane."

34:29.668 --> 34:31.168
What's a hashtag?

34:32.403 --> 34:33.603
Mcgee: Thousands of
sterile puppets fans

34:33.605 --> 34:35.739
Will be on the lookout
for this plane.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.541
Hashtag "this could work," boss.

34:38.509 --> 34:39.609
Go.

34:47.151 --> 34:49.219
♪

35:07.505 --> 35:09.573
♪

35:23.354 --> 35:25.522
Well, we got our first hit.

35:28.259 --> 35:29.759
It's from hopewell, virginia.

35:29.761 --> 35:31.895
Vance: Admiral, sending you
the coordinates now.

35:31.897 --> 35:33.463
I'll alert norad.

35:44.575 --> 35:47.410
Here we go.

35:47.412 --> 35:50.680
Atc's tried to make contact.
Keith isn't answering.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.282
Might have the radios
turned off.

35:52.284 --> 35:54.784
Transponders, too. We're not
getting any radar hits.

35:54.786 --> 35:57.187
Mcgee:
Another tweet.

36:00.825 --> 36:03.226
Bergin: You know,
the last time we heard

36:03.228 --> 36:05.195
From keith,
it was on the unicom frequency

36:05.197 --> 36:06.463
For lafayette field.

36:06.465 --> 36:08.198
Can we transmit
on that frequency?

36:08.200 --> 36:09.399
It'll take a minute.

36:11.302 --> 36:13.937
We've scrambled two hornets from
oceana to make an intercept.

36:13.939 --> 36:15.238
Armed?

36:15.240 --> 36:17.174
Yes, but we can't bring
the plane down

36:17.176 --> 36:18.208
Over a populated area.

36:22.947 --> 36:25.949
We're getting a lot of tweets--
he's flying a zigzag course.

36:25.951 --> 36:28.318
Mcgee:
We got another.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.690
He's skirting around towns.

36:33.692 --> 36:34.824
We've got a video attached.

36:38.763 --> 36:40.263
That's brilliant.

36:40.265 --> 36:42.766
Whose idea was it
to track the plane on twitter?

36:48.906 --> 36:51.274
I know where he's headed.

36:51.276 --> 36:53.276
The    <i>benjamin frankl</i>just left;
it's still in the bay.

37:11.729 --> 37:13.830
I'm monitoring the
fighter pilots' transmissions.

37:13.832 --> 37:15.332
They're closing in.

37:15.334 --> 37:16.533
Put it on a speaker.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.815
Pilot:
Target has crossed the shoreline

37:31.817 --> 37:34.884
And is less than one minute
from the <i>benjamin franklin.</i>

37:34.886 --> 37:37.621
We're circling back.
We're circling back.

37:42.693 --> 37:44.761
Several of keith's
aviation classmates are on board

37:44.763 --> 37:46.763
For their first deployment.
Lieutenant robbins--
the woman

37:46.765 --> 37:49.266
That keith's been trying
to get in contact with all week.

37:49.268 --> 37:52.702
She gets to fly attack fighters,
and he doesn't.

37:52.704 --> 37:55.272
Have norad/northcom
alert the ship.

37:55.274 --> 37:57.040
Vance: 5,000 personnel,
over 80 aircraft

37:57.042 --> 37:59.009
And a $6 billion ship.

37:59.011 --> 38:00.610
That's a hell of a statement.

38:00.612 --> 38:01.845
He's never gonna get near it;

38:01.847 --> 38:02.912
It's protected
by state-of-the-art

38:02.914 --> 38:04.547
Air-and-surface defense systems.

38:04.549 --> 38:06.416
He's on a suicide mission.

38:06.418 --> 38:09.886
Have permission
to shoot down a civilian target?

38:09.888 --> 38:11.888
The ship has the right
of self-defense.

38:11.890 --> 38:14.324
Man (over speakers):
This is the t.A.O.
(alarm blaring)

38:14.326 --> 38:17.394
Now set general quarters.
Now set general quarters.

38:17.396 --> 38:20.697
Low, slow flyer
incoming starboard side.

38:20.699 --> 38:24.567
Low, slow flyer incoming
starboard side.

38:32.710 --> 38:34.744
All right, boss,
you got the unicom frequency.

38:39.550 --> 38:41.685
Lieutenant keith.

38:41.687 --> 38:44.688
This is
ncis special agent gibbs.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.890
The <i>benjamin franklin</i>
<i>has locked on to you</i>

38:46.892 --> 38:48.425
With their weapons.

38:50.428 --> 38:51.995
Lieutenant?

38:54.065 --> 38:57.467
It doesn't have to end this way.

38:57.469 --> 38:59.569
You don't understand.

38:59.571 --> 39:02.439
I need to do this.

39:03.574 --> 39:05.375
No, you don't.

39:07.044 --> 39:09.646
To hurt dana robbins
and others on board

39:09.648 --> 39:11.381
Doesn't solve a damn thing.

39:13.117 --> 39:15.485
You'll never reach the ship.

39:15.487 --> 39:18.421
Turn around.
We'll help you.

39:18.423 --> 39:20.757
Missile systems
are ready to fire.

39:20.759 --> 39:23.093
Pilot:
Air-to-air on final approach.
Target's painted.

39:23.095 --> 39:24.527
Weapons hot.

39:26.831 --> 39:30.734
Gibbs: Lieutenant keith,
you will be fired upon.

39:46.884 --> 39:49.686
Pilot: Civilian plane is
executing a left-hand turn.

39:49.688 --> 39:53.790
Confirming, civilian pilot
is turning away from carrier.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.525
Gibbs:
Lieutenant keith,

39:55.527 --> 39:58.895
Atc will give you vectors
for a safe landing.

39:58.897 --> 40:01.431
It's too late.

40:05.436 --> 40:06.503
(beep)

40:12.777 --> 40:14.778
Pilot:
Civilian aircraft has exploded.

40:14.780 --> 40:18.715
Repeat, civilian aircraft
has exploded.

40:28.492 --> 40:30.026
Get some sleep, guys.

40:30.028 --> 40:31.127
Thanks, boss.

40:32.129 --> 40:34.497
Hey, eugene.
Need something?

40:34.499 --> 40:36.666
I'm here
for special agent mcgee.

40:36.668 --> 40:38.868
You know why I'm here.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.770
I'm heading up the
I.G. Investigation.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.806
Lost credentials are
a very serious offense,

40:42.808 --> 40:45.642
Especially when they are
not immediately reported.

40:50.981 --> 40:54.918
(whispers): Hey. We've had
a long couple of days, you know?

40:55.886 --> 40:57.887
I need you
to come with me.

40:59.623 --> 41:01.191
Vance:
Hang on.

41:01.193 --> 41:02.725
Agent mcgee
isn't going anywhere.

41:02.727 --> 41:04.794
Director?
Agent mcgee

41:04.796 --> 41:06.529
And the rest
of his team's presence

41:06.531 --> 41:08.465
Has just been requested
at the white house.

41:08.467 --> 41:09.732
His clever strategy

41:09.734 --> 41:11.568
Just saved
countless lives

41:11.570 --> 41:13.503
And a multibillion-dollar
weapons system.

41:16.874 --> 41:18.842
Yeah, we'll get back to you
on that, eugene.
