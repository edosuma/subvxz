Burritos, enchiladas...

Black beans and rice, man.
Thas Puerto Rican. I gotta take you...

03:43.813 --> 03:47.112
I hate to break up
the great Latino gourmet debate...

03:47.183 --> 03:50.118
but we ain't off the clock yet.

03:50.186 --> 03:54.520
Since we got a few more days here,
can somebody...

03:54.591 --> 03:57.526
please tell me who the hook is?

03:57.594 --> 04:00.119
Fifteen, is that you?

04:00.196 --> 04:03.222
You got a hook on box 22?

04:03.299 --> 04:06.200
The man is asking you
if you're hooked on 22, dumb shit.

04:06.269 --> 04:08.635
Watch your mouth, Sixpack.
Fifteen to shack.

04:08.705 --> 04:10.832
This is Jones.
I ain't the hook.

04:10.907 --> 04:12.841
Seven to shack. I'm the hook.

04:12.909 --> 04:15.742
Okay there, seven.
Pack up box 22 and call it a day.

04:15.812 --> 04:18.872
Hey, Willie, you trip on a tit
or something? We're all waitin' on ya.

04:18.947 --> 04:20.505
Go suck on a shrimp, Sixpack.

04:29.759 --> 04:31.727

04:40.904 --> 04:42.735
You heard the man.
Les get movin'.

04:42.806 --> 04:45.001
Come on, guys.
We only have three days left.

04:45.074 --> 04:47.008
I hear that.

04:55.819 --> 04:58.515
Put the kettle on, Beck.
We're coming home.

05:19.542 --> 05:21.840
Well, Doc,
not so as you'd notice...

05:21.911 --> 05:24.379
but the sun has set
on yet another day...

05:24.447 --> 05:27.780
of hard labor and toil
here at the homestead.

05:27.851 --> 05:32.618
Sixteen tons
and what do you get

05:32.689 --> 05:35.487
Another day older
and deeper in debt

05:35.558 --> 05:38.118
Saint Peter, don't you call me
'cause I can't go

05:38.194 --> 05:41.493
I owe my soul to the company store

05:50.473 --> 05:53.738
Jonesy! Help!

05:53.810 --> 05:55.141
Cobb!

05:55.211 --> 05:57.179
My rebreather's stopped!
I'm losing compression!

05:57.247 --> 05:59.681
I'm gonna blow my suit!
Doc! Beck!

05:59.749 --> 06:02.479
Yeah, I got you, DeJesus.
You look fine from in here.

06:02.552 --> 06:04.850
- Give me a readout.
- My rebreather's stopped!

06:04.921 --> 06:07.617
I'm losing compression!
I can't breathe!

06:09.359 --> 06:11.554
I can't get an accurate readout
if you panic.

06:11.628 --> 06:14.927
Doc, we got an emergency here.
We need you. Got trouble.

06:17.400 --> 06:20.665
So just breathe slowly
and through your nose...

06:20.737 --> 06:22.898
and out through your mouth.

06:22.972 --> 06:24.963
I think you're hyperventilating.

06:25.041 --> 06:28.272
- Hyperventilating, my ass!
- How do you do this?

06:28.344 --> 06:30.278
- He's gonna blow.
- No, he's not gonna blow!

06:32.949 --> 06:34.883
Doc, come on!

06:38.154 --> 06:40.486
- Check his oxygen level.
- Yeah, I'm doin' that.

06:40.557 --> 06:43.390
- Do something, quick!
- I'm doin' it.

06:48.364 --> 06:49.956
Help!

06:51.367 --> 06:52.459
Damn!

06:54.737 --> 06:56.637
Hook him to my RV-four transpac.

06:56.706 --> 06:58.867
Right. Hook him to the RV...

06:58.942 --> 07:01.809
No! Don't do that!
Don't circumventilate him.

07:01.878 --> 07:04.608
I think you're risking
an implosion probability.

07:04.681 --> 07:07.514
Doc, we need you.
Bring him into the shack.

07:07.584 --> 07:10.610
- There's not enough time!
- You've got time. Just do it.

07:10.687 --> 07:12.211
I'm gonna die!

07:12.288 --> 07:14.586
You ain't gonna die.

07:21.331 --> 07:23.322
Just keep him moving.

07:26.736 --> 07:29.603
Take it easy. We'll make it.

07:33.242 --> 07:35.233
Open the damn door.

07:38.815 --> 07:41.340
Come on! Get him inside!

07:50.193 --> 07:52.559
Keep him moving.

08:01.537 --> 08:04.131
Come on, lift lock. Go.

08:04.207 --> 08:06.232
Come on, lift lock. Up.

09:08.871 --> 09:12.034
Rebreathers. I don't trust anything that
doesn't have bubbles comin' out of it.

09:12.108 --> 09:14.042
It ain't the goddamn suit, man.
Is Beck.

09:14.110 --> 09:17.546
Is not his fault.
Doc shoulďve been there.

09:17.613 --> 09:19.774
If he was a real shack boss,
Doc would have been there.

09:19.849 --> 09:21.476
He got real lucky.

09:21.551 --> 09:24.987
Hey, Wall Street broke
the 15,000-point barrier today.

09:27.056 --> 09:28.990
Shit. There goes my bonus.

09:30.426 --> 09:32.519
You know, I stood next to a guy
who blew a suit once.

09:32.595 --> 09:35.325
He was in the Indian Ocean.

09:35.398 --> 09:37.832
- That is not a pretty sight.
- Leave Hazy alone, man.

09:37.900 --> 09:41.563
One tiny little hole
in the fucking toe of his suit.

09:41.637 --> 09:43.969
No bigger than your dick.

09:44.040 --> 09:46.372
Yeah, that ocean came in.

09:46.442 --> 09:50.503
The pressure just crammed
his whole body up into his helmet.

09:50.580 --> 09:52.514
We just buried his helmet.

09:54.817 --> 09:58.719
- That woulďve been you, DeJesus.
- Hey, I know about implosion.

09:58.788 --> 10:02.315
Yeah, I bet you do.
I bet you was imploding in your pants.

10:02.391 --> 10:05.519
- Knock it off, Sixpack!
- Cut it out, you guys.

10:05.595 --> 10:08.621
We've been stuck down in this hole
for a hell of a long time.

10:08.698 --> 10:12.566
We had a close call. We're not gonna
let something like this break us apart.

10:12.635 --> 10:15.502
The doc is my responsibility.

10:20.877 --> 10:22.811
Bullshit.

10:37.326 --> 10:42.127
It would be just my luck to finish two
months' worth of work two miles under...

10:42.198 --> 10:44.530
and have the whole place fall apart
with just three days left.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.534
Anyone check weather up top?

10:46.602 --> 10:49.435
Is raining, but is
supposed to be clear for pickup.

10:49.505 --> 10:51.473
As long as there's no waves.
I hate waves.

10:51.541 --> 10:55.739
Waves my ass. Do you know what you'd
be doin' if you were up top right now?

10:55.812 --> 10:57.803
Drinkin' brew and eatin' pussy.

10:57.880 --> 11:01.611
- How about gettin' stuck in traffic?
- Wherever I can find it.

11:01.684 --> 11:03.618
I'll tell you what you'd be doing.

11:03.686 --> 11:06.484
Be watching news on TV thas so bad,
it makes you nauseous.

11:06.556 --> 11:09.787
So bad that you get in your car
to get some fresh air...

11:09.859 --> 11:12.020
and after five minutes,
you realize...

11:12.094 --> 11:15.222
the air's so dirty,
you can't breathe.

11:15.298 --> 11:18.995
If you're lucky enough
to get back to your house...

11:19.068 --> 11:21.696
that looks the same
as everybody else's...

11:21.771 --> 11:24.899
you find that your wife
is as fat as she ever was.

11:24.974 --> 11:27.169
And the only reason your kids
aren't strung out on the drugs...

11:27.243 --> 11:30.269
they were using is because
they've found some new drugs...

11:30.346 --> 11:33.645
which screw 'em up even more,
and thas just the good part.

11:33.716 --> 11:35.946
You people don't appreciate
how good you've got it down here.

11:38.454 --> 11:41.651
- Don't let me interrupt you, Mr. Cobb.
- Thas all right. I was just finished.

11:41.724 --> 11:45.125
- How are you feeling there?
- I'm okay.

11:45.194 --> 11:47.662
- See the doc yet?
- No.

11:47.730 --> 11:50.164
Well, you better let the doc
take a look at you after dinner.

11:50.233 --> 11:52.701
- Since he was busy earlier.
- When we needed him.

11:52.768 --> 11:55.168
Why don't you let me
handle the doc.

11:55.238 --> 11:57.672
Makes me feel better already.

11:59.342 --> 12:02.641
I was looking at the shack
maintenance hours outstanding.

12:02.712 --> 12:05.044
I see where this is going.

12:05.114 --> 12:09.778
All of us owe some shack maintenance
time. Tonight would be a good time.

12:09.852 --> 12:12.685
No way, Mr. Beck.
No bleepin' way.

12:12.755 --> 12:15.986
You can't call shack duty
on top of a full shift.

12:16.058 --> 12:17.992
Thas a union violation.
Is in the contract.

12:18.060 --> 12:21.552
Right on, Cobb.
Les hear it for the shop steward.

12:21.631 --> 12:24.566
Hear that, Becky? The company's
got to abide by the rules.

12:24.634 --> 12:27.831
I know about the contract.
You can follow the letter...

12:27.904 --> 12:30.395
of the contract to the law and spend
an extra workday gettin' it done...

12:30.473 --> 12:32.964
or you can get it done tonight
and call tomorrow a down day.

12:33.042 --> 12:36.170
- What, are you giving us the day off?
- Looks that way.

12:36.245 --> 12:38.304
What about our quota?

12:38.381 --> 12:41.248
You're only 25 tons off quota.

12:41.317 --> 12:43.785
You're bound to go way over that
by the last day.

12:43.853 --> 12:47.482
Look, folks, is just a day off.
It don't make no difference to me.

12:47.556 --> 12:50.047
Is just up to you.
I thought it might be good.

12:50.126 --> 12:52.356
- Hell, I could use a day off.
- Me too.

12:52.428 --> 12:56.831
- What the hell.
- Okay, shop stewarďs three.

12:57.900 --> 13:00.869
- Four.
- Four. Anybody else?

13:00.937 --> 13:03.132
- Six.
- All right, here's what we got.

13:04.807 --> 13:07.332
Mr. Cobb, we still got that rattle
in the air duct somewhere.

13:07.410 --> 13:09.344
- Take a look at that.
- Okay.

13:09.412 --> 13:12.438
Williams, run a diagnostic
on DeJesus's suit.

13:12.515 --> 13:15.609
- Anybody else got any suit problems?
- Yeah, my pocket.

13:15.685 --> 13:18.779
Can you check my pocket, sweetheart?

13:22.525 --> 13:24.823
Good evening. Name's Thompson.
Party of one.

13:24.894 --> 13:28.261
My reservation was 8:15.
Not too near the orchestra, please.

13:28.331 --> 13:30.299
Are you gonna come
to work tomorrow, Doc?

13:30.366 --> 13:32.300
No, I'll be on the golf course
in the morning.

13:32.368 --> 13:34.427
Then, if I don't have
any babies to deliver...

13:34.503 --> 13:36.903
I could stop by after lunch.

13:36.973 --> 13:40.374
We almost had an accident today.
DeJesus's suit.

13:41.477 --> 13:43.411
You have something
to say to me?

13:43.479 --> 13:45.777
Yeah. Section 1412...

13:45.848 --> 13:48.339
of the Tri-Oceanic manual requires...

13:48.417 --> 13:52.285
a mining shack's medical officer
to be present in the control room...

13:52.355 --> 13:54.619
during all exterior operations.

13:54.690 --> 13:57.318
I just wanna make real damn sure
thas clear.

14:03.232 --> 14:05.427
I'll keep it to nine holes
in the morning.

14:09.071 --> 14:12.404
Thank you, sir, for taking care
of that situation.

14:57.286 --> 15:00.983
- Listen to it, for Chriss sake.
- Is just gettin' old, thas all.

15:01.057 --> 15:05.551
You don't see Doc opening me up
every time my joints start to creak.

15:05.628 --> 15:08.791
As long as is recycling
the air, let it be. Come on.

15:08.864 --> 15:11.799
Ten to one is a short.

15:22.344 --> 15:24.278
Piece of cake.

15:29.118 --> 15:31.052
Great.

16:01.050 --> 16:04.349
Oh, mama! What a pair.

16:05.621 --> 16:07.213
Whad you say?

16:08.524 --> 16:10.515
I said, "What a pair."

16:10.593 --> 16:15.394
Our shack boss and his washed-up
doctor buddy make quite a...

16:15.464 --> 16:18.297
- What did you think I said?
- That you liked my boobs.

16:22.972 --> 16:26.237
You watch the old Cobb magic,
all right?

16:28.010 --> 16:29.944
Compliments of Bowman.

16:40.856 --> 16:42.323
Yeah.

16:47.897 --> 16:49.956
How in the hell did you do that?

16:50.032 --> 16:53.331
You don't say anything to anybody.
Job security.

16:53.402 --> 16:56.030
All right? Les go.

16:56.105 --> 16:59.404
Now, wait a minute, man.
How in the hell did you do that?

17:03.913 --> 17:05.847
Thas clean.

17:07.782 --> 17:09.751
But there's nothing wrong with it.
Oh, my God!

17:15.156 --> 17:17.387
Come here, Kuki.

17:18.928 --> 17:20.862
Sixpack, you shit!

17:24.867 --> 17:26.835
Surprise!

17:26.902 --> 17:30.497
How much silver are we gonna
start taking out of that mine again?

17:30.573 --> 17:33.508
Well, Martin, I think you've got
an honest-to-God bonanza on your hands.

17:33.576 --> 17:36.511
You can haul us out in a couple of days.
This mine will play itself.

17:36.579 --> 17:39.104
When I told the Director
of Atlantic Operations...

17:39.181 --> 17:43.550
that we had to stick a geologist
down there and turn that mine around...

17:43.619 --> 17:47.453
I had no idea that you were going
to prove me a genius.

17:47.523 --> 17:50.492
- Well, I'm glad you're happy.
- I'm ecstatic.

17:50.559 --> 17:52.652
'Cause I can't wait
to get the fuck outta here.

17:52.728 --> 17:54.161
What?

17:54.230 --> 17:57.961
I said, I really can't wait
to get back to exploration diving.

17:58.033 --> 17:59.967
I miss the research, and...

18:00.035 --> 18:03.596
By the way, I ran that check
on Dr. Thompson.

18:03.672 --> 18:06.539
He has a few incidences
of insubordination...

18:06.609 --> 18:10.409
but his credentials
are very impressive.

18:10.479 --> 18:13.710
Pharmacology.
He pioneered several vaccines.

18:13.782 --> 18:15.909
Well, this ain't the Mayo Clinic.
How'd he get down here?

18:17.019 --> 18:19.214
A serum he developed
killed several people.

18:19.288 --> 18:22.519
An accident, but it got blown
all out of proportion.

18:22.591 --> 18:23.990
Now, look.

18:24.059 --> 18:26.493
Things are beginning to move
very fast now.

18:26.562 --> 18:29.531
If you're having a problem with him
or you need any help...

18:29.598 --> 18:31.793
just say the word.

18:34.203 --> 18:36.569
No, I don't think
is anything I can't handle.

18:36.639 --> 18:37.936
Good.

18:40.576 --> 18:43.511
How are your stocks doin'?
Haven't you made your million yet?

18:43.579 --> 18:45.740
Not yet.

18:45.814 --> 18:50.513
- How's Tri-Oceanic doing, Bow?
- Got money in this tub?

18:50.586 --> 18:54.078
Yeah. I signed up
for the stock option.

18:54.156 --> 18:56.624
Last year when they lost a tanker,
the bottom fell out of their stock.

18:56.692 --> 18:58.717
I lost a bloody fortune.

18:58.794 --> 19:00.728
You take your money too seriously.

19:15.678 --> 19:20.581
You're damn right, I do.
I'm not down here for fun.

19:20.649 --> 19:23.982
Fun? Somebody talkin' fun?

19:25.421 --> 19:27.685
Look at those white legs!

19:27.756 --> 19:31.089
Hey, Willie, I'm sorry
about that little incident tonight.

19:31.160 --> 19:34.994
You know, I just thought
a little humor might loosen things up.

19:36.432 --> 19:37.990
Hey, watch it!

19:39.068 --> 19:40.797
No hard feelings?

19:40.869 --> 19:43.599
Nope. Sweet dreams.

19:48.210 --> 19:51.145
I got a date with an angel.

20:01.924 --> 20:03.516
Come on, baby.

20:03.592 --> 20:05.526
Sit on my face.

20:15.671 --> 20:19.471
Goddamn it, Williams! You bitch!

20:19.541 --> 20:23.136
Look at my foot!
Look at my goddamn foot!

20:23.212 --> 20:25.680
- I thought you'd find that funny.
- You think is funny?

20:25.748 --> 20:28.182
You're gonna think is funny
when you eat this goddamn thing!

20:28.250 --> 20:31.117
- What the hell's goin' on here?
- Look at my foot!

20:31.186 --> 20:33.882
This bitch put a goddamn
sea monster in my bunk!

20:33.956 --> 20:36.356
- How do you know it was her?
- It was her!

20:36.425 --> 20:39.394
- Are you calling me a liar?
- That may be the size of it, Bubba.

20:39.461 --> 20:43.158
- You two just pulled sea duty tomorrow.
- Bullshit!

20:43.232 --> 20:45.564
Oh, geez! Will you pipe down?

20:46.735 --> 20:49.363
You just got half a day.
Any more hoopla, is a full one.

20:54.143 --> 20:55.576
Ready to drill.

20:59.915 --> 21:01.849
Looks like a nice vein of ore.

21:01.917 --> 21:03.851
- Les blow it.
- Blow this.

21:07.589 --> 21:09.022
Charge activated.

21:09.091 --> 21:11.582
Hey, Willie, remind you of anything?

21:17.199 --> 21:18.723
Oh, yeah!

21:25.908 --> 21:27.899
It looks like the mother lode, guys.

21:33.115 --> 21:35.049
I need more light on that, seven.

21:36.118 --> 21:39.781
Sixpack, you hear that?
We need more light.

21:43.091 --> 21:45.787
All right, look.

21:45.861 --> 21:47.226
My cable's stuck.

21:56.638 --> 21:59.607
Sixpack, whas happened?

21:59.675 --> 22:02.439
We've lost him.

22:02.511 --> 22:05.412
Well, what are you doing?
Having a party out there?

22:05.481 --> 22:07.415
Beck, I'm looking for him.

22:13.755 --> 22:17.054
Shack to seven.
Whas going on out there?

22:20.496 --> 22:21.895
He's gone.

22:21.964 --> 22:24.899
Williams, speak to me.
Whas happening out there?

22:27.903 --> 22:30.269
Sixpack, answer.

22:30.339 --> 22:32.068
Oh, my God!

22:34.109 --> 22:38.045
Come on, Williams.
Whas the alternate?

22:38.113 --> 22:40.047
Try 35.

22:40.115 --> 22:42.049
Williams? There she is.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.255
Williams, you hear me?
Whas going on out there?

22:48.323 --> 22:50.257
He's gone over the South Ridge.

22:54.930 --> 22:57.660
I'm going down after him.

22:57.733 --> 23:00.361
Watch yourself, 'cause we don't know
what the hell is over that ridge.

23:00.435 --> 23:02.869
Come on, Jonesy, work it out.

23:05.541 --> 23:08.101
- Sixpack's lost!
- Weren't they tied?

23:08.176 --> 23:10.110
- I don't know!
- They're supposed to be tied.

23:10.178 --> 23:12.646
- Come on. Les go.
- Move it!

23:12.714 --> 23:14.648
Oh, God!

23:21.790 --> 23:23.382
Whave we got?

23:27.229 --> 23:29.459
- Tube worms.
- How's she gonna get out?

23:36.772 --> 23:39.707
Bowman, whas the self-contained
air capacity of that suit?

23:39.775 --> 23:41.709
Thirty minutes.

23:48.216 --> 23:50.150
This is six to shack.

23:54.156 --> 23:57.353
For Goďs sakes, why doesn't
Sixpack have his blinkers on?

23:57.426 --> 24:00.224
The man could be two feet away
and on fire and she wouldn't see him.

24:07.569 --> 24:09.002
What?

24:09.071 --> 24:11.005
What is this?

24:13.775 --> 24:15.709
A ship?

24:46.942 --> 24:48.375
Thas Russian.

24:51.346 --> 24:53.075
Are you picking this up?

24:53.148 --> 24:56.413
Yeah, we got it. Can you open up
that picture a little for us?

24:59.187 --> 25:00.779
Leviathan.

25:00.856 --> 25:04.053
- What?
- Leviathan.

25:04.126 --> 25:06.060
- Bowman, run a check.
- Sir.

25:08.196 --> 25:11.495
- Williams, whas your air reading?
- Twenty minutes.

25:11.566 --> 25:14.228
We're gonna give you five,
then we're coming in.

25:14.302 --> 25:16.236
Jones, Cobb, suit up.

25:25.814 --> 25:27.748
I'm going inside.

25:38.894 --> 25:41.192
Sixpack, answer me!

25:50.105 --> 25:52.096
Baltic Sea?

26:02.918 --> 26:04.852
What have you got there, Bowman?

26:04.920 --> 26:08.583
The Leviathan. Currently with
the Russian Fleet in the Baltic Sea.

26:08.657 --> 26:11.854
Currently horseshit. Currently is
rusted junk, and we're lookin' at it.

26:11.927 --> 26:14.862
Well, is gotta be wrong.
Maybe you didn't enter it correctly.

26:16.098 --> 26:18.123
Is right here.
The Baltic Sea.

26:18.200 --> 26:21.397
Maybe a ship sinks
and they don't notice is missing.

26:22.571 --> 26:26.200
Williams, you got one minute to find
Sixpack and get your butt out of there.

26:31.413 --> 26:36.077
If Willie's got a minute,
how much time does Sixpack have?

27:10.318 --> 27:11.785
The infirmary.

27:38.380 --> 27:40.109
I'm rich, honey!

27:42.851 --> 27:46.252
Safety negligence?
I never even heard a word.

27:46.321 --> 27:48.983
How can I be on report?
Ain't that right, Cobby?

27:49.057 --> 27:51.787
Don't Cobby me.
You're on your own this time.

27:51.860 --> 27:53.794
You almost fucked up everybody's day.

27:54.763 --> 27:57.561
A Timex. And is still ticking.

27:57.632 --> 28:00.931
A little Russian money.
It don't look like much.

28:01.002 --> 28:03.835
Here's something for you, Bow.

28:06.308 --> 28:08.776
Hey, Sixpack,
look at your girlfriends.

28:19.354 --> 28:22.152
- Whas that?
- "Kitty Does Kiev."

28:22.224 --> 28:23.919
- Porn. Right up your alley.
- Let me see that.

28:23.992 --> 28:25.823
Is in Russian.
I don't know what it says.

28:25.894 --> 28:29.159
- May I see it, please?
- Is not really "Kitty Does Kiev."

28:31.499 --> 28:35.663
- Is the captain's log on videotape.
- Don't tell me you read Russian.

28:35.737 --> 28:38.865
Russian, German, Italian, Spanish...

28:38.940 --> 28:41.465
French, a little Swahili
and a smattering of Hindi.

28:41.543 --> 28:44.341
- Is part of my premed background.
- Bullshit.

28:44.412 --> 28:46.607
Would you believe
a Russian grandmother?

28:46.681 --> 28:49.343
That I believe.

28:49.417 --> 28:53.217
- Whas this?
- Personal effects. Can you read that?

28:54.289 --> 28:55.722
Deceased.

28:58.293 --> 29:00.227
Whas all this?

29:02.697 --> 29:04.289
Deceased.

29:12.941 --> 29:14.875
Deceased. All of them.

29:16.778 --> 29:19.338
- Mr. Cobb, wrap all that up.
- Right.

29:19.414 --> 29:21.348
DeJesus, dump this last box.

29:25.520 --> 29:29.354
Thas nice.
What is this? Vodka.

29:29.424 --> 29:32.359
Stresnavga.
Hey, thas good stuff.

29:32.427 --> 29:34.554
Make for a great end-of-shift party.

29:34.629 --> 29:37.097
If I'm on report,
I guess this bottle's mine, huh?

29:37.165 --> 29:39.360
Well, I guess you're right.
It is yours.

29:39.434 --> 29:43.530
But is pilferage, so now you're down
for two counts of safety negligence...

29:43.605 --> 29:46.335
for risking Williams's life,
going on that boat and possessing...

29:46.408 --> 29:48.103
restricted material.

29:48.176 --> 29:50.371
- All this gets impounded.
- Is done.

29:54.816 --> 29:56.750
And one more thing.

29:56.818 --> 30:00.652
I think if I hear you
call me "Becky" one more time...

30:00.722 --> 30:04.123
I'm gonna pop your tops...
all six of 'em.

30:19.341 --> 30:22.071
"My infirmary's filled.

30:23.078 --> 30:25.706
The doctors on board tell me
is like a tropical infection.

30:28.650 --> 30:31.278
But is not like anything
I've ever seen before.

30:33.722 --> 30:35.656
And there's something else
I don't understand."

30:36.725 --> 30:39.125
And then it goes off.

30:39.194 --> 30:42.493
So what do you want me to say?
It all sounds mysterious?

30:44.799 --> 30:47.393
Well, why did he leave his log tape?

30:47.469 --> 30:49.960
Why are there two ships with
the same name in different places?

30:50.038 --> 30:53.303
Hell, I don't know. You read Russian.
Maybe you read it wrong.

30:53.375 --> 30:56.503
I didn't. Even if I had, there
should be a record of some ship...

30:56.578 --> 30:59.809
thas sunk within 100 miles of here,
and there's not.

31:08.523 --> 31:11.424
And look at this tear.
This hole in the hull.

31:13.595 --> 31:18.498
Thas the result of an explosion.
I think that was a torpedo hit.

31:19.734 --> 31:21.702
I think that ship
was sunk on purpose.

31:21.770 --> 31:25.536
Now how the hell do you know
thas a torpedo hit?

31:25.607 --> 31:27.632
A collision with another boat
can produce that hole.

31:27.709 --> 31:29.700
I don't agree with you.

31:29.778 --> 31:31.712
- This hole would not be so jagged...
- So what?

31:31.780 --> 31:34.214
So what if they scuttle
their own boat?

31:34.282 --> 31:36.978
I can't get bent outta shape
just because some people...

31:37.052 --> 31:40.818
got some jungle rot and ended up dead
on a barge on the bottom of the ocean.

31:40.889 --> 31:45.292
I know about rocks. I know about stones.
I don't know about Russian boats.

31:46.795 --> 31:49.355
Plus, I bet you five dollars
is a clerical error.

31:49.431 --> 31:53.162
Hell, we sounded the horn on it.
Let the maritime people figure it out.

31:53.234 --> 31:56.067
I gotta fix the lift lock.

31:56.137 --> 31:59.072
Okay, two more days.

31:59.140 --> 32:01.301
Les have no waves.

32:01.376 --> 32:05.142
Weather system on line.
Tracking meteorological patterns.

32:05.213 --> 32:08.614
- Beginning scan.
- I hate...

32:08.683 --> 32:10.412
waves.

32:12.887 --> 32:16.084
You know that in Switzerland,
they speak four major languages?

32:16.157 --> 32:19.149
- Ask me if I care.
- I do.

32:19.227 --> 32:21.821
When I get outta here,
I'm goin' there.

32:21.896 --> 32:24.490
I'm gonna find a nice
snow-covered chalet...

32:24.566 --> 32:29.162
warm little woman,
crackling fire, and ski.

32:32.774 --> 32:36.733
If you're gonna do that, you should
wear what you wear to the beach.

32:36.811 --> 32:38.210
I hate the beach.

32:38.279 --> 32:41.248
Hey, guys. Look what I got.

32:41.316 --> 32:43.511
- I don't believe it. You got 'em.
- Yeah, put it there.

32:45.386 --> 32:47.650
What are you doing
with Beck's personnel records?

32:47.722 --> 32:49.246
Watch. You'll see.

32:49.324 --> 32:53.283
Four, zero, five, four...

32:53.361 --> 32:54.851
eight, six.

32:54.929 --> 32:58.228
You guys are so full of shit.
How stupid do you think he is?

32:58.299 --> 33:00.358
Who's gonna use
their social security number?

33:03.872 --> 33:06.067
Bingo!

33:06.141 --> 33:07.540
That bottle's mine.

33:07.609 --> 33:11.067
- Cute, DeJesus. Specimen cups?
- Loosen up, Bow.

33:11.146 --> 33:14.411
- Hey, Willie, got one poured for you.
- Not for me, thanks.

33:14.482 --> 33:16.643
All you do is exercise.
You gotta live a little.

33:16.718 --> 33:18.652
My astronaut training
starts in two days.

33:18.720 --> 33:20.950
Forget space cadet.
I'll drink hers.

33:21.022 --> 33:24.458
What happens if he goes back
and finds the bottle missing?

33:24.526 --> 33:27.256
He won't.
I put the vodka in here.

33:27.328 --> 33:29.558
Smart lad.

33:29.631 --> 33:31.155
Cheers.

33:34.536 --> 33:36.561
- Is water.
- Beck switched it.

33:36.638 --> 33:38.572
That son of a gun
doesn't trust us.

33:38.640 --> 33:41.165
That pretty-boy little turd.
I'm gonna fix his ass.

33:41.242 --> 33:43.574
- There goes our party.
- Is not bad.

33:43.645 --> 33:46.079
- Is not bad at all.
- Is water.

34:06.100 --> 34:09.194
Did I tell you
vodka's my favorite drink?

34:50.110 --> 34:52.045
That was a pretty big one, huh?

34:52.112 --> 34:54.445
You'd think we'd get
used to it by now.

34:54.514 --> 34:58.042
You're wasting your time here.
This needs a shutdown and an overhaul.

35:01.289 --> 35:05.350
Yeah, I need an overhaul.
How's the training goin'?

35:08.029 --> 35:10.259
Is going well.

35:10.331 --> 35:12.799
I think I've got a good shot.

35:12.867 --> 35:15.563
I just wish everyone would
stop giving me a hard time.

35:15.637 --> 35:18.265
Yeah, I know what you mean.

35:19.340 --> 35:21.274
Why don't you give me a hand
and hit that button, huh?

35:24.779 --> 35:27.009
- Push D.L.
- What?

35:27.081 --> 35:29.015
D.L.

35:35.290 --> 35:36.621
Oh, man.

35:40.995 --> 35:42.929
What are you doing down here?

35:42.997 --> 35:45.830
Well, I'm trying to fix
this short in the lift lock.

35:45.900 --> 35:48.095
What are you doing down here?

35:48.169 --> 35:50.433
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

35:50.505 --> 35:52.530
- You don't belong in a mine.
- You got that right.

35:53.875 --> 35:55.809
But somebody just got
the brilliant idea...

35:55.877 --> 35:58.607
to stick a geologist down here
in charge of you cowboys.

35:58.680 --> 36:00.875
I think maybe they thought that
just 'cause I could tell...

36:00.948 --> 36:02.882
shit from silver,
I'd know how to run this place.

36:02.950 --> 36:04.247
Do you?

36:06.454 --> 36:08.046
You tell me.

36:09.390 --> 36:11.324
I think you handled
DeJesus pretty well.

36:11.392 --> 36:13.986
Yeah?

36:14.062 --> 36:17.554
Well, that was luck.
I was scared to death.

36:18.366 --> 36:19.993
What about Sixpack?

36:21.736 --> 36:23.260
What about him?

36:24.706 --> 36:26.833
Did you bust him because of me?

36:28.810 --> 36:30.072
Maybe.

36:32.013 --> 36:36.109
Well, I appreciate that.
But I'm okay.

36:38.286 --> 36:40.413
Yeah, I know.

36:43.591 --> 36:44.819
Good.

36:50.398 --> 36:54.129
Oh, by the way, how did you know
they'd get into the vodka?

36:57.071 --> 36:59.039
Hell, thas what I woulďve done.

37:01.676 --> 37:03.644
Maybe you're more one of us
than you think.

37:20.228 --> 37:22.162
Good morning.

37:24.632 --> 37:26.156
Sorry.

37:26.234 --> 37:30.136
Okay. Thas good.

37:31.773 --> 37:34.003
Just look at my forehead.

37:34.075 --> 37:36.009
Thas it.

37:41.149 --> 37:43.083
Let me see your tongue.

37:46.320 --> 37:49.312
Good morning, gentlemen.
Whas wrong, Doc?

37:49.390 --> 37:54.191
I'm getting a pretty good
imitation of a hangover.

37:54.262 --> 37:56.492
- Take off your shirt.
- It ain't no hangover.

37:56.564 --> 37:58.998
Feels about 1000 times worse.

38:04.439 --> 38:06.373
How long did you have these spots?

38:06.441 --> 38:08.375
- What?
- Don't touch it.

38:16.350 --> 38:20.514
Well, as First Officer of the shack,
is your call.

38:20.588 --> 38:23.887
But if I were you,
I'd not be too hasty.

38:23.958 --> 38:25.425
I don't get it.

38:25.493 --> 38:30.396
Any evacuation 24 hours
before a scheduled pickup...

38:30.465 --> 38:33.957
won't look good on
an otherwise excellent record.

38:34.035 --> 38:37.027
But like I said, is your call.

38:44.512 --> 38:46.605
Well, as bad as he is,
there's no way...

38:46.681 --> 38:49.673
we're gonna make that quota
without his sad self down there.

38:49.750 --> 38:52.947
- He's tankin' on us.
- No, I don't think so.

38:53.020 --> 38:56.012
I heard him last night,
and he didn't sound so good.

38:56.090 --> 38:59.253
The company will consider that
when they look at our numbers.

38:59.327 --> 39:03.093
Sweetheart, the company
doesn't give a damn about why.

39:03.164 --> 39:05.132
The contract says,
if we miss our quota...

39:05.199 --> 39:07.759
they only gotta pay us half pay
for the entire month.

39:07.835 --> 39:09.769
Believe me, they'll stick to it.

39:09.837 --> 39:12.465
The bastarďs
definitely tanking on us.

39:12.540 --> 39:15.168
- Yep, I think you're right.
- I wish you were, but he's not.

39:15.243 --> 39:17.177
He's really sick.
He ain't comin' out today.

39:17.245 --> 39:19.236
- Williams, take her down.
- Thas terrific.

39:19.313 --> 39:22.908
- Three months of work down the tubes.
- You're outta here, guys.

39:22.984 --> 39:26.283
So, what, are you taking inventory?

39:26.354 --> 39:29.187
No, Mr. Jones.
I'm getting ready to play Ping-Pong.

39:32.627 --> 39:35.289
I'm goin' to work.
You got a problem with that?

39:35.363 --> 39:37.160
- Work?
- Work.

39:49.810 --> 39:52.608
- Try to hold as steady as you can.
- What the hell is it?

39:52.680 --> 39:55.171
- I'm taking a little skin sample.
- Come on. Give me something.

39:55.249 --> 39:57.274
Just a second.
Steady as you can.

39:57.351 --> 40:00.787
Try to do it as quick as I can.
Thas it. I got it.

40:00.855 --> 40:03.881
Steady, steady. Easy.

40:06.594 --> 40:09.995
Is all right.
Keep your hands off it.

40:10.064 --> 40:11.998
Here. Hold that.

40:14.302 --> 40:16.896
I'm gonna take a look at this
under the microscope.

40:52.106 --> 40:54.165
Container 22 is full, sir.

40:54.241 --> 40:56.835
This one's full, so les run her
outta here and bring in a new one.

40:56.911 --> 40:58.708
You got it.

41:14.095 --> 41:17.121
"An organism of unknown origin."
No kidding.

41:17.198 --> 41:19.758
Tell me something I don't know.

41:27.208 --> 41:28.766
Goddamn it, take a guess.

42:33.574 --> 42:37.169
Good work out there, Becky.
I mean, Mr. Beck.

42:37.244 --> 42:39.178
Not bad, Mr. Beck.

42:40.314 --> 42:43.147
No harm done.

42:43.217 --> 42:45.151
Just don't call me cracker.

42:46.087 --> 42:48.214
Perk up, sport.

42:48.289 --> 42:52.555
How can the guy die
from a skin rash in eight hours?

42:54.361 --> 42:57.524
Put this on.
I want you to examine him.

42:57.598 --> 43:00.658
- I'm not a doctor.
- For this, you don't need to be.

43:29.530 --> 43:31.464
Oh, Lord.

43:32.733 --> 43:35.031
Am I wearing this 'cause
you think it might be contagious?

43:35.102 --> 43:37.036
I don't know if it is
or it isn't.

43:37.104 --> 43:39.868
I don't know a damn thing.
Neither does anyone else.

43:39.940 --> 43:42.773
I've been going back and forth
with Narragansett Naval all day...

43:42.843 --> 43:44.777
consulting with the best people
in marine medicine...

43:44.845 --> 43:46.779
the best people in virology.

43:46.847 --> 43:49.213
They don't even believe
the symptoms I'm describing.

43:49.283 --> 43:51.877
Their best guess,
and thas all it is...

43:51.952 --> 43:54.352
is that before Sixpack died,
he was undergoing...

43:54.421 --> 43:56.355
some form of genetic alteration.

43:56.423 --> 43:58.584
Genetic alteration from what?

43:58.659 --> 44:00.593
It could be a million things.

44:00.661 --> 44:03.562
Something in the food, the air.

44:03.631 --> 44:07.362
Sixpack went in that ship,
and so did Williams.

44:08.836 --> 44:10.770
I want to examine
the rest of the crew.

44:10.838 --> 44:13.773
But I don't want to create a panic,
so until I get some answers...

44:13.841 --> 44:15.775
I don't think we should tell them
that Sixpack is dead.

44:20.548 --> 44:23.745
Skin condition? Herpes? Measles?
What is it?

44:23.818 --> 44:25.877
Is a little difficult
to describe.

44:25.953 --> 44:28.046
Christ, it would be
a hell of a thing...

44:28.122 --> 44:30.420
if I went back up to the roof
with a herpes thing.

44:30.491 --> 44:33.483
My wife would never
understand that at all.

44:34.795 --> 44:36.729
I don't think we have
to worry about that, do we?

44:36.797 --> 44:38.731
She wouldn't understand that at all.

44:38.799 --> 44:41.165
She'd think I was down here
screwing my head off or something.

44:41.235 --> 44:42.793
Put on your shirt.

44:43.904 --> 44:46.634
- Is all right?
- Yeah, you're fine.

44:49.844 --> 44:52.210
This whole thing is unnecessary, Doc.

44:52.279 --> 44:55.305
The only skin problem
I can see is white people.

44:58.152 --> 45:00.620
How come you're wearin' those gloves?

45:00.688 --> 45:02.986
It ain't bend-over time, is it?

45:03.057 --> 45:06.458
- Anything wrong?
- No, I just wanted to see something.

45:06.527 --> 45:08.757
Thas all.

45:08.829 --> 45:12.697
You think it has anything to do
with going on that ship?

45:12.766 --> 45:14.859
Well, is a possibility.
But if that was the case...

45:14.935 --> 45:17.130
you'd be showing some symptoms,
wouldn't you?

45:17.204 --> 45:20.332
- I'm okay?
- You're fine.

45:20.407 --> 45:22.341
No, really, you're fine.

45:22.409 --> 45:25.310
Great. Thanks, Doc.

45:25.379 --> 45:28.041
What do you mean, a skin problem?

45:28.115 --> 45:30.208
Your skin changes?

45:30.284 --> 45:34.345
- Yeah, it blackens. It gets scaly.
- What, like a fish?

45:38.993 --> 45:41.826
- Yeah, like a fish.
- I was just joking, Doc.

45:46.567 --> 45:49.035
You can finish
gettin' dressed out there.

45:52.039 --> 45:55.167
Oh, Bowman. I'm sorry.
I'll be right back.

46:03.284 --> 46:05.878
- Generic alteration?
- Genetic.

46:05.953 --> 46:09.389
Whatever. But you think is
restricted to this one crew member?

46:09.456 --> 46:11.390
- Well, so far, but...
- But what?

46:11.458 --> 46:13.392
What if it turns out
to be nothing?

46:13.460 --> 46:15.587
What are you talking about?
Is already killed one man!

46:15.663 --> 46:20.362
But you have no proof that
this disease is contagious, do you?

46:20.434 --> 46:22.925
And we've been wrong before,
haven't we, Dr. Thompson?

46:25.706 --> 46:28.368
Look, Martin, I think
you're missing the point here.

46:28.442 --> 46:30.910
My crew's in jeopardy.
I've seen this disease.

46:30.978 --> 46:32.912
And is no day at the beach.

46:32.980 --> 46:35.676
So by way of paragraph 539
of the manual...

46:35.749 --> 46:38.741
I'm ordering you to start
an emergency medical evacuation...

46:38.819 --> 46:40.753
of all the personnel
on the shack.

46:40.821 --> 46:42.914
Is your call,
but unfortunately...

46:42.990 --> 46:45.618
we can't pick you up so soon.

46:45.693 --> 46:48.992
There's a hurricane 600 miles
off the coast of Cuba...

46:49.063 --> 46:50.997
possibly coming your way.

46:51.065 --> 46:54.432
And if it does, the company does not
want to risk losing you folks.

46:54.501 --> 46:57.527
Are you saying you're not gonna
pick us up at the scheduled time?

46:57.604 --> 46:59.572
It shouldn't be a long delay.

46:59.640 --> 47:02.074
Well, whas a long delay?
A day? A week? What?

47:02.142 --> 47:05.600
Twelve hours. We should know something
first thing in the morning.

47:05.679 --> 47:07.943
- I'll keep you posted.
- You better be there.

47:09.283 --> 47:11.114
- Twelve hours.
- Twelve hours.

47:11.185 --> 47:13.153
I promise.

47:27.668 --> 47:30.102
Bow, are you okay?

47:30.170 --> 47:32.229
Oh, my God. Come on.

47:34.308 --> 47:36.242
Can you help us here?

47:40.514 --> 47:43.347
- Les put her here.
- Come on. Take it easy.

47:46.587 --> 47:48.521
Is all right.

47:51.191 --> 47:54.786
You're gonna be all right, okay?
I'm gonna go find Doc, all right?

47:54.862 --> 47:57.160
Hey, Doc?
Maybe he's with Sixpack.

47:59.900 --> 48:03.461
Doc? Hey, you in here?

48:07.207 --> 48:09.539
Hey, man, how you doin'?

48:09.610 --> 48:14.377
We made quota today, man, no thanks
to you, you dog, but we made it.

48:14.448 --> 48:17.315
You won't believe this, man,
but Beck helped us out.

48:17.384 --> 48:20.353
Yeah, we just brought Bowman in, man.

48:20.421 --> 48:22.355
She don't look too good.

48:22.423 --> 48:25.358
You know, I hope
what you got ain't catchin'.

48:26.860 --> 48:29.124
Hey, look, I'm sorry, man.

48:29.196 --> 48:32.131
You go on back to sleep, okay?

48:32.199 --> 48:35.134
I'll talk to you later, all right?

48:42.576 --> 48:46.034
- I'm gonna go check the control room.
- Okay.

48:46.113 --> 48:49.139
- I'll be back in a minute, okay?
- Please don't go!

48:49.216 --> 48:52.674
Please don't leave me. I'm so sick.

48:52.753 --> 48:56.348
You're gonna be okay. Don't worry.

49:50.577 --> 49:52.511
My hair's coming out.

50:12.132 --> 50:14.123
Where'd you say? The infirmary?

50:21.041 --> 50:23.532
I don't understand.
I just left her here.

50:36.523 --> 50:37.990
Is Doc.

50:51.672 --> 50:53.105
Oh, man.

51:29.142 --> 51:33.511
Other than that, there's not much more
that I can tell you about it...

51:34.848 --> 51:38.306
except that none of you have
any of the symptoms.

51:38.385 --> 51:41.650
And this disease, it killed Bow?

51:44.091 --> 51:46.252
No, she killed herself.

51:48.862 --> 51:51.194
Hey, we're getting outta here
just in time.

51:51.265 --> 51:53.460
Thas a whole 'nother problem.

51:53.533 --> 51:57.333
We're on hold for the pickup. There's
a hurricane rollin' into this sector.

51:57.404 --> 52:00.601
- A hurricane?
- Yeah. We're delayed 12 hours.

52:00.674 --> 52:04.701
Twelve hours? Whare we gonna do?
We can't stay here for 12...

52:06.713 --> 52:10.274
- What was that?
- Wait a minute. Hold on. Just stay put.

52:10.350 --> 52:11.783
Okay.

52:31.471 --> 52:33.939
Oh, my God.

52:34.007 --> 52:35.941
What is this?

52:36.009 --> 52:37.909
Whas goin' on?

53:06.673 --> 53:09.107
- Okay, get the door.
- Got it.

53:14.114 --> 53:17.481
The contract states that you can't
dispose of a body without authorization.

53:17.551 --> 53:20.315
Come on. Will you for once
forget about the contract?

53:20.387 --> 53:22.947
Section C of the Health and Safety Code.
Watch it.

53:25.859 --> 53:27.451
Program that lock.

53:28.929 --> 53:31.796
Hey, I feel something.

53:31.865 --> 53:33.833
What are you talkin' about?
They're dead.

53:33.900 --> 53:36.130
Wait a minute. I feel something too.

53:36.203 --> 53:39.036
- Les go.
- Somebody's alive in here.

53:39.106 --> 53:41.097
- Come on.
- Les flush it.

53:41.174 --> 53:44.473
- "Flush it?" They're human beings!
- What if one's alive?

53:44.544 --> 53:46.569
- How about a moment of silence?
- Les do it.

53:46.646 --> 53:49.672
- My God, they're alive!
- Les have a look.

53:54.388 --> 53:56.913
- Don't stop!
- What the hell was that?

53:56.990 --> 53:58.582
Hit the button!

54:00.160 --> 54:02.185
- Hit the lift button!
- Get outta there!

54:02.262 --> 54:04.423
Flush the damn thing! Flush it!

54:07.501 --> 54:09.935
Come on!

55:43.597 --> 55:45.030
Oh, God!

55:50.170 --> 55:54.573
Is coming up now. That camera's gonna
move into this room. Thas it.

55:54.641 --> 55:58.577
Some kind of sick bay or lab
or something. Hold it. Run it back.

56:00.413 --> 56:03.075
Thas it. Stop. Now move in.

56:04.584 --> 56:08.042
See? It looks like a human skull,
but I don't know.

56:08.121 --> 56:10.351
- There's something about it. Is...
- Bigger.

56:19.466 --> 56:24.301
Well, somebody's been screwing around.
Just take a look at that hand.

56:24.371 --> 56:27.534
- Look at the size of it.
- If you were tampering with genetics...

56:29.409 --> 56:32.037
why stop with the base model?

56:32.112 --> 56:35.309
Why not try to alter the human form?

56:35.382 --> 56:39.842
Homo aquaticus, a man who could live
underwater. Think of the possibilities.

56:39.920 --> 56:41.854
Regeneration.

56:41.922 --> 56:45.414
The ability to withstand
extreme cold, pressure...

56:45.492 --> 56:48.518
Just think of it.
Undersea mining. Underwater farming.

56:48.595 --> 56:51.530
So whas next? I mean, what if
we run outta airplanes one day?

56:51.598 --> 56:55.295
What are we gonna do?
Just grow a whole bunch of bird people?

57:00.574 --> 57:03.805
Loosely translated:
"Don't fuck with Mother Nature."

57:22.762 --> 57:25.196
I better let the company know.

57:26.533 --> 57:28.797
Have you ever thought
that they may suspect already?

57:30.236 --> 57:32.204
Yeah. I thought about that.

57:32.272 --> 57:35.241
I think they got some kind
of commitment to their people.

57:35.308 --> 57:37.708
Save that speech for your ad campaign.

57:37.777 --> 57:40.837
This company's commitment is
to the almighty dollar.

57:40.914 --> 57:44.645
If you think, based on what
we've told them, that Tri-Oceanic...

57:44.718 --> 57:48.415
is gonna risk exposing themself
to potential market loss to save us...

57:48.488 --> 57:50.888
you're in for
an eye-opening experience.

57:50.957 --> 57:52.390
Maybe.

57:53.960 --> 57:57.589
Maybe so. And I know your life's gone
a couple of bad rounds.

57:57.664 --> 58:01.896
But it doesn't necessarily mean
this whole company's one big bummer.

58:24.391 --> 58:26.825
I think we got something here.

58:29.529 --> 58:31.463
Son of a bitch.

58:35.602 --> 58:38.537
I don't get it.
Why did they put it in the vodka?

58:38.605 --> 58:43.065
Because it was an experiment, man.
They put the drug in the vodka!

58:43.143 --> 58:45.077
They meant to trick them
into takin' it.

58:45.145 --> 58:47.943
That way, see, they didn't know
what they were drinkin'.

58:48.014 --> 58:51.472
I mean, with us, they would have
put it in the coffee.

58:51.551 --> 58:53.883
- What are you talkin' about?
- Come on.

58:53.953 --> 58:57.912
You know how mothers put the castor oil
in with orange juice?

58:57.991 --> 59:00.983
They trick the baby into drinkin' it
so he don't know what he's drinkin.

59:01.061 --> 59:04.428
Thas the kind of shit
they was doin', man!

59:04.497 --> 59:06.465
Fool. He coulďve got us all killed.

59:06.533 --> 59:10.560
You weren't holy when you were shooting
that vodka. It coulďve been anyone.

59:10.637 --> 59:13.765
Well, Miss High and Mighty,
it doesn't seem to bother you none.

59:13.840 --> 59:15.831
Yeah, it bothers me.

59:15.909 --> 59:18.503
You deal with it your way.
I'll deal with it mine.

59:18.578 --> 59:23.015
You know that in Gstaad they have
64 square miles of ski slopes?

59:23.083 --> 59:25.745
Sixty-four square miles.

59:27.687 --> 59:31.680
How can you sit there goin', "Shh, shh,"
after what we just went through?

59:31.758 --> 59:35.057
And another thing. I'm gettin' tired
of hearin' about your goddamn skiin'.

59:35.128 --> 59:39.258
You don't know shit about skiin'.
They don't ski in Spanish Harlem.

59:39.332 --> 59:41.266
What about what we just saw?

59:41.334 --> 59:45.532
Like Willie said, you deal with it
your way, and I'll deal with it mine.

59:45.605 --> 59:49.871
- Doesn't anybody care what happened?
- Whare you gonna do about it? Huh?

59:50.944 --> 59:53.913
Sixpack and Bow are dead.

59:57.884 --> 01:00:00.751
I can't help what happened. Can you?

01:00:02.922 --> 01:00:06.323
I'm gonna go get somethin' to eat.
Anybody want anything?

01:00:07.393 --> 01:00:10.590
Eat? After what we just went through?

01:00:29.849 --> 01:00:32.113
The storm's still holding its course.

01:00:32.185 --> 01:00:35.814
What about that disease?
Still just the one crew member?

01:00:35.889 --> 01:00:38.380
No change. Still just the one.

01:01:08.154 --> 01:01:10.384
Everybody's jumpy. What are you doin'?

01:01:10.456 --> 01:01:12.390
Lookin' for butter for the popcorn.

01:01:12.458 --> 01:01:17.088
Look, Hazy, you gonna make me finish
this puzzle by myself, or what?

01:01:17.163 --> 01:01:20.291
I should.
You know how long that took me?

01:01:20.366 --> 01:01:22.630
Hundreds, thousands, millions of hours.

01:01:26.105 --> 01:01:29.040
- I'll be right there.
- Okay. Hurry up.

01:02:13.186 --> 01:02:15.381
Holy shit!

01:02:16.556 --> 01:02:20.822
Please, God, help me!
Help me, Jonesy! Help me.

01:02:22.362 --> 01:02:25.331
I'm gonna go get some help.
I'll be right back, okay?

01:02:25.398 --> 01:02:27.764
Don't leave me.
Jonesy, don't leave me!

01:02:30.503 --> 01:02:32.528
- Please.
- I'll be back.

01:02:40.046 --> 01:02:42.241
Look! Is got Hazy!
Stay here and watch the door!

01:02:42.315 --> 01:02:45.250
Don't let him out!
I'm gonna go get the doc.

01:02:56.663 --> 01:02:58.597
I didn't want to tell her about Bowman.

01:02:58.665 --> 01:03:01.156
I listened to Martin, and my mind said,
"She's full of shit."

01:03:01.234 --> 01:03:03.168
Is got DeJesus! Come on!

01:03:33.499 --> 01:03:36.434
Don't go in there.
Don't touch anything!

01:03:37.603 --> 01:03:40.094
What the hell you doin'?
You supposed to be watchin' the door!

01:03:40.173 --> 01:03:42.232
I won't watch that thing
without protection.

01:03:42.308 --> 01:03:44.572
- That thing is my friend.
- Your friend is not human!

01:03:44.644 --> 01:03:47.135
Shut up, both of you! Jones!
Les go find him.

01:03:47.213 --> 01:03:50.580
Okay? Come on. Les go find him.
Wait a minute. Where's Willie?

01:03:52.218 --> 01:03:53.651
Whas happening?

01:03:55.321 --> 01:03:57.448
My God, she's out there.

01:03:57.523 --> 01:03:59.457
All right. Jones, you come with me.

01:03:59.525 --> 01:04:02.961
Doc, you and Cobb check your office
and the dorm. Les go.

01:04:43.469 --> 01:04:45.334
Is her scarf.

01:04:45.405 --> 01:04:48.568
Oh, sorry. What are you doing here?

01:04:48.641 --> 01:04:52.099
- What the hell you doin'?
- I've been trying to fix these lights.

01:04:52.178 --> 01:04:55.909
- Whas going on?
- What got Sixpack and Bowman is here.

01:04:55.982 --> 01:04:58.678
- What?
- It just got DeJesus.

01:05:25.678 --> 01:05:28.340
All right. We're talkin' turkey.

01:05:35.221 --> 01:05:37.155
Oh, my God.

01:05:42.261 --> 01:05:44.195
The blood supply.

01:05:45.465 --> 01:05:47.865
Oh, my God.

01:05:47.934 --> 01:05:50.300
It got the blood supply.

01:06:41.754 --> 01:06:43.984
Is growing. Is had a meal.

01:06:44.056 --> 01:06:46.581
- It needs blood?
- Apparently.

01:06:46.659 --> 01:06:50.595
This is great. You're tellin' me we got
a goddamn Dracula in here with us?

01:06:50.663 --> 01:06:53.689
Thas why that one on the ship
was dead. It needed blood.

01:06:53.766 --> 01:06:57.463
- What one on that ship?
- Tell the rank-and-file the secret.

01:06:57.537 --> 01:07:00.802
Whatever it is,
it appears to be a genetic aberration.

01:07:00.873 --> 01:07:04.536
- No shit.
- Whare you trying to tell us?

01:07:04.610 --> 01:07:10.276
It has all the characteristics of
deep-sea marine life: Scales, gills...

01:07:12.351 --> 01:07:15.479
regeneration, even a period of dormancy.

01:07:15.555 --> 01:07:18.490
But the fact that it remembered
where that plasma was stored...

01:07:18.558 --> 01:07:22.289
seems to imply that is has
some other quality.

01:07:22.361 --> 01:07:25.387
- What?
- It absorbs its victim's intelligence.

01:07:25.464 --> 01:07:27.830
Intelligence may not be the right word.

01:07:27.900 --> 01:07:32.234
The hell with semantics. Are you saying
is part DeJesus, Sixpack and Bowman?

01:07:32.305 --> 01:07:36.537
I don't know. I'd just be guessing.

01:07:36.609 --> 01:07:41.569
But I do know the Russians deliberately
sank that ship to protect themselves.

01:07:44.317 --> 01:07:46.512
Maybe to protect us all.

01:07:46.586 --> 01:07:51.387
Then I say we protect ourselves. Les
escape into the air bubbles and get out.

01:07:51.457 --> 01:07:54.824
And hit the surface in a hurricane?
The storm'd rip those bubbles to pieces.

01:07:54.894 --> 01:07:58.523
- They'd never find us.
- We wouldn't stand a chance.

01:08:01.734 --> 01:08:04.760
- What are we gonna do?
- I think we got one shot.

01:08:04.837 --> 01:08:09.274
Just one shot. We lure it to the swamp,
flush it out just like the other.

01:08:09.342 --> 01:08:11.367
How're we gonna do that?

01:08:18.850 --> 01:08:21.581
So we rendezvous in the mess
in 30 minutes.

01:08:21.654 --> 01:08:24.747
Mr. Cobb, synchronize 30 minutes.

01:08:24.823 --> 01:08:29.022
Mark. Got it?
Okay, so I'll run this by you again.

01:08:29.095 --> 01:08:32.359
If Jones and I aren't back here
in 30 minutes in the mess...

01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:35.366
hurricane or nothin', you get in those
escape bubbles and haul ass.

01:08:36.435 --> 01:08:39.063
- Les do it.
- Be careful with this.

01:08:39.138 --> 01:08:41.765
- Don't worry. I don't want to give more.
- Take care.

01:08:41.841 --> 01:08:44.071
I'll do my best.

01:08:44.143 --> 01:08:46.077
Okay, les go.

01:09:33.125 --> 01:09:35.524
You know, I was quite good once.

01:09:37.263 --> 01:09:40.198
When I did something,
it was important, you know?

01:09:43.903 --> 01:09:47.805
I developed drugs and techniques...

01:09:47.872 --> 01:09:50.808
thare used every day
by doctors all over the world.

01:09:53.245 --> 01:09:56.305
- Made a difference.
- It still does.

01:10:00.453 --> 01:10:02.387
This itches like hell.

01:10:07.193 --> 01:10:09.127
- I'm all right.
- Let me have a look.

01:10:09.195 --> 01:10:11.129
It really itches.

01:10:14.533 --> 01:10:16.467
Thas because is healing.

01:10:17.803 --> 01:10:20.101
I'm gonna change that dressing
to make you more comfortable.

01:10:20.172 --> 01:10:22.663
- Where are you going?
- The infirmary.

01:10:22.742 --> 01:10:24.232
Without protection?

01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:26.744
- You shouldn't go out there.
- She's right, you know.

01:12:22.094 --> 01:12:25.291
- You hear that?
- I hear it.

01:12:25.364 --> 01:12:27.298
Here we go.

01:12:54.126 --> 01:12:57.323
- Take off your shirt.
- Sure.

01:12:57.396 --> 01:12:59.796
I'm cold.

01:13:01.367 --> 01:13:03.494
Help me, please.

01:13:03.569 --> 01:13:06.003
Oh, yeah, sure.

01:13:15.948 --> 01:13:18.473
Help me!

01:13:18.551 --> 01:13:20.178
Whas happening?

01:13:20.252 --> 01:13:22.049
Help!

01:13:45.311 --> 01:13:47.779
- Willie! Run!
- Run!

01:13:47.846 --> 01:13:49.780
Get over here!

01:14:09.735 --> 01:14:12.795
How are you doin'? All right?
Where's Doc and Cobb?

01:14:12.871 --> 01:14:15.032
- It got Doc.
- Wait a minute. It was just here.

01:14:15.107 --> 01:14:18.008
- I know.
- Wait a second. You saw it?

01:14:18.077 --> 01:14:22.207
- It was in Cobb. It was in him.
- Slow down. There's two of them?

01:14:23.315 --> 01:14:25.749
- Shit.
- All right.

01:14:25.818 --> 01:14:28.343
- How are you doin'?
- Okay.

01:14:28.420 --> 01:14:30.945
Okay, now what?

01:14:31.023 --> 01:14:34.288
How do you feel about big waves?

01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:36.294
I love waves.

01:15:11.630 --> 01:15:14.565
We're trapped.
The escape bubbles are gone.

01:15:14.633 --> 01:15:16.624
- The door.
- Hey, look at this.

01:15:16.702 --> 01:15:18.693
"I am fully aware of the finality
of my decision.

01:15:18.771 --> 01:15:21.968
It is my hope that our sacrifice
will mean that the human race...

01:15:22.041 --> 01:15:24.032
will never know this awful mutation."

01:15:24.109 --> 01:15:28.068
- Our death warrant.
- Signed by the good doctor.

01:15:39.491 --> 01:15:41.288
Hell with it.

01:15:44.063 --> 01:15:47.692
- What are you doing?
- Well, I'm gonna find out...

01:15:47.766 --> 01:15:50.234
how far up Shit Creek we are.

01:16:00.312 --> 01:16:03.907
- Thank goodness you're still alive.
- Where you been?

01:16:03.982 --> 01:16:06.974
Get your ass out here now
and get us. Right now!

01:16:07.052 --> 01:16:10.146
Please calm down.
We haven't deserted you.

01:16:10.222 --> 01:16:13.521
Naturally, after we received Dr.
Thompson's message, we were concerned.

01:16:13.592 --> 01:16:15.753
But we never would have deserted you.

01:16:15.828 --> 01:16:17.659
When are you coming?

01:16:17.730 --> 01:16:20.756
- You said 12 hours.
- Thas the bad news.

01:16:20.833 --> 01:16:24.633
The hurricane has turned your way.
Right now, is on a course of...

01:16:24.703 --> 01:16:27.433
Just answer the goddamn question.
When are you coming?

01:16:27.506 --> 01:16:30.669
- Hopefully, within the next 48 hours.
- Forty-eight hours?

01:16:30.743 --> 01:16:33.109
I realize you must have gone
through hell...

01:16:33.178 --> 01:16:35.203
Gone? Bitch, we're still here!

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:38.215
I can't control the weather.
Rest assured, your SOS...

01:16:38.283 --> 01:16:41.081
was received by the coast guard
and the navy...

01:16:41.153 --> 01:16:44.850
and we will be responding
at the earliest, safest opportunity.

01:16:44.923 --> 01:16:50.156
- Just don't promise us nothin'.
- I realize this must sound ridiculous.

01:16:50.229 --> 01:16:53.289
- No shit.
- Now please try and get some rest.

01:16:53.365 --> 01:16:56.391
How are we gonna rest?
I can't sleep. Can you sleep?

01:16:56.468 --> 01:16:58.959
- Get some rest?
- Save your breath.

01:16:59.037 --> 01:17:02.939
- Damn. In 48 hours? No way.
- We don't have much choice, do we?

01:17:03.008 --> 01:17:06.444
I'll tell you what. I'll take a watch.
You all try to get some rest.

01:17:06.512 --> 01:17:10.380
I ain't gonna never be able
to sleep again. In life. Ever.

01:17:57.529 --> 01:18:00.225
"Request weather report, July 26."

01:18:00.299 --> 01:18:03.962
- "Data not available."
- Come on.

01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:12.743
"Files Closed."

01:18:12.811 --> 01:18:15.712
- Oh, man.
- They know, don't they?

01:18:15.781 --> 01:18:21.048
Yeah. I think they're just sittin'
up there, decidin' what to do with us.

01:18:21.119 --> 01:18:22.552
Maybe they have.

01:18:24.122 --> 01:18:27.956
- Whare you looking for?
- I'm seeing how my investmens doing.

01:18:28.026 --> 01:18:30.824
"The stock of Tri-Oceanic Corp.
Took a bath today...

01:18:30.896 --> 01:18:33.865
when news of a tragic mining accident
was revealed to investors.

01:18:33.932 --> 01:18:37.800
The board of directors was called into
a meeting in New York this afternoon.

01:18:37.870 --> 01:18:41.237
A spokesperson revealed that
the accident destroyed Shack Seven...

01:18:41.306 --> 01:18:43.240
off the coast of Florida.

01:18:43.308 --> 01:18:45.242
Eight miners are reported dead.
All bodies are missing.

01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:48.575
Killed were Steven Beck,
Elizabeth Williams, Justin Jones...

01:18:48.647 --> 01:18:52.208
Dr. Glen Thompson, Tony Rodero, Bridget
Bowman, G.P. Cobb, Buzz Parrish."

01:18:52.284 --> 01:18:54.309
Martin, you bitch.

01:18:54.386 --> 01:18:56.445
Welcome to the union, boss.

01:18:56.521 --> 01:18:58.455
We're all expendable.

01:18:59.825 --> 01:19:02.385
- Doc, I owe you five dollars.
- Five dollars?

01:19:05.163 --> 01:19:07.688
- Emergency warning.
- Listen.

01:19:07.766 --> 01:19:10.360
- Countdown to implosion.
- The air's stopped.

01:19:10.435 --> 01:19:13.165
Ten minutes and counting.

01:19:13.238 --> 01:19:16.469
- They ripped open an air duct.
- Can we fix it?

01:19:16.541 --> 01:19:19.135
There are 20 miles of pipe.
They coulďve tapped in anywhere.

01:19:19.211 --> 01:19:20.644
Thas true.

01:19:24.816 --> 01:19:27.114
Cobb. Job security.

01:19:27.185 --> 01:19:29.676
Is that rattle in Corridor A.

01:19:29.755 --> 01:19:33.122
You got it. Is showin' us where it is.

01:19:33.191 --> 01:19:36.285
- Is drawin' us out.
- It didn't waste any time, did it?

01:19:36.361 --> 01:19:39.125
You can't go out there.
Thas what it wants.

01:19:39.197 --> 01:19:42.633
If we lose enough air in here, the
internal pressure will drop, and crunch.

01:19:42.701 --> 01:19:44.293
Implosion, babe.

01:19:44.369 --> 01:19:47.031
Wait. You don't think
I'm staying here?

01:19:47.973 --> 01:19:49.907
Nine minutes to implosion.

01:19:54.012 --> 01:19:56.776
- Is over here!
- Is that it?

01:19:56.848 --> 01:19:58.406
Yeah.

01:20:00.719 --> 01:20:03.654
- Is going!
- We're losin' air faster than I thought.

01:20:07.192 --> 01:20:09.490
- Go! Here.
- Don't spend all day down there.

01:20:09.561 --> 01:20:11.791
Don't worry. I won't.

01:20:11.863 --> 01:20:13.797
Les do it.

01:20:25.077 --> 01:20:27.671
Eight minutes to implosion.

01:20:47.632 --> 01:20:50.692
- Oh, no. Damn!
- Can we fix it?

01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:55.762
- Can we shut it down someplace else?
- Come on.

01:20:55.841 --> 01:20:59.902
- What do you think? I wanna die?
- We're not gonna die. What do we do?

01:20:59.978 --> 01:21:01.912
- How should I know?
- You know this shack!

01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:04.847
- I don't know!
- Come on! This shack's your home, man!

01:21:04.916 --> 01:21:08.875
The swamp. There's a backup air valve
at the swamp. If we...

01:21:11.957 --> 01:21:14.721
- What?
- I just saw Doc.

01:21:14.793 --> 01:21:17.261
No, Jones. Les get outta here.

01:21:17.329 --> 01:21:18.762
Come on.

01:21:23.869 --> 01:21:25.769
Seven minutes to implosion.

01:21:28.607 --> 01:21:30.632
- Look out!
- Watch out!

01:21:38.583 --> 01:21:40.676
- Did you get it?
- I think we did it!

01:21:40.752 --> 01:21:42.845
- I don't know!
- Hurry!

01:21:42.921 --> 01:21:46.049
Move it! The door's closing!

01:21:54.599 --> 01:21:58.000
The other door's closing!

01:21:59.771 --> 01:22:03.104
Willie, get out! Get out!

01:22:03.175 --> 01:22:04.802
- Torch it!
- Careful!

01:22:04.876 --> 01:22:06.343
Is jammed!

01:22:15.854 --> 01:22:18.789
Check that door!
Willie, get outta here!

01:22:18.857 --> 01:22:21.189
- The door's closing!
- Get that door!

01:22:22.794 --> 01:22:26.890
- Go! Go! Go!
- Six minutes to implosion.

01:22:26.965 --> 01:22:28.660
Come on!

01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:05.097
Grab my hand!

01:23:07.305 --> 01:23:10.433
Grab it! Come on!

01:23:12.010 --> 01:23:14.410
Go! Come on!

01:23:14.479 --> 01:23:17.243
You got it.

01:23:24.589 --> 01:23:26.454
Come on!

01:23:31.363 --> 01:23:33.797
Let me help him! Let me go!

01:23:33.865 --> 01:23:35.662
The handsaw on the table!

01:23:44.109 --> 01:23:46.134
- Help him!
- Stay back!

01:23:59.591 --> 01:24:01.616
Four minutes to implosion.

01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:13.804
There's no air.

01:24:18.210 --> 01:24:20.508
The door's jammed!

01:24:24.716 --> 01:24:28.777
The air valve! Is too hot!
I can't get to it!

01:24:28.853 --> 01:24:31.447
- Forget it! Get the suits!
- The suits? You crazy?

01:24:31.523 --> 01:24:34.287
Bring the lift bags!

01:24:35.393 --> 01:24:38.294
- How're we gonna get to the surface?
- Like this.

01:24:38.363 --> 01:24:42.732
We'll triple the inflation ratio. We'll
float to the top like a balloon. Go!

01:24:45.537 --> 01:24:48.870
Okay, les hook 'em up.
Get in the suits.

01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:51.101
- What about yours?
- Get in the suit.

01:24:52.544 --> 01:24:55.775
Three minutes to implosion.

01:25:12.931 --> 01:25:14.728
Come on!

01:25:22.707 --> 01:25:24.607
Les go!

01:25:24.676 --> 01:25:26.109
See you topside.

01:25:27.279 --> 01:25:29.406
Get into your suit!

01:25:29.481 --> 01:25:32.507
Beck, get into the suit!

01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:38.245
Don't be a fool!

01:25:44.696 --> 01:25:46.823
Two minutes to implosion.

01:25:51.336 --> 01:25:52.769
Kill me.

01:25:52.837 --> 01:25:55.397
My God. DeJesus.

01:26:27.038 --> 01:26:28.471
Shit!

01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.727
Oh, shit!

01:26:55.033 --> 01:26:57.297
One minute to implosion.

01:29:46.237 --> 01:29:48.171
You made it!

01:29:53.411 --> 01:29:56.209
Base to Coast Guard
Rescue Chopper 1437.

01:29:56.281 --> 01:29:59.079
Make one more attempt in search area
and return to base.

01:30:11.129 --> 01:30:15.088
- So where's the goddamn hurricane?
- You all right?

01:30:15.166 --> 01:30:17.100
- I made it.
- Yeah?

01:30:17.168 --> 01:30:21.468
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm all right.
I'll be all right. Okay.

01:30:25.176 --> 01:30:29.237
Base to Rescue Chopper 1437.
Any visual contact?

01:30:29.314 --> 01:30:31.248
- Negative.
- Return to base.

01:30:44.028 --> 01:30:45.461
Is cold.

01:30:48.466 --> 01:30:50.161
- Hey!
- Here!

01:30:50.234 --> 01:30:52.031
- Over here!
- Give me that last flare.

01:30:55.106 --> 01:30:56.971
There's a flare straight ahead.

01:30:57.041 --> 01:31:00.670
- Jones! Look!
- Chopper.

01:31:04.415 --> 01:31:06.406
- Sharks!
- Where are they?

01:31:06.484 --> 01:31:08.042
- Too close!
- Stay close.

01:31:11.956 --> 01:31:14.857
Stay close!

01:31:18.863 --> 01:31:21.661
Talk about having a bad day.

01:31:32.410 --> 01:31:34.310
- Help!
- Yes! Come on!

01:31:41.753 --> 01:31:43.914
- Jesus!
- Willie!

01:31:43.988 --> 01:31:46.149
- Get those people up!
- Go!

01:31:47.558 --> 01:31:49.958
- Grab a hand!
- Get outta here!

01:32:02.006 --> 01:32:04.531
Is got Jones!

01:32:04.609 --> 01:32:06.133
Come back!

01:32:06.210 --> 01:32:08.405
Don't! Save yourself!

01:32:17.789 --> 01:32:20.121
Come back!

01:32:24.929 --> 01:32:26.658
Say "Aah," motherfucker!

01:32:30.902 --> 01:32:32.995
Les get outta here!

01:32:51.389 --> 01:32:54.187
Helicopter 405 heading back
to platform P.O.C.

01:33:59.390 --> 01:34:02.951
They don't want anything else
to do with it, you know?

01:34:05.963 --> 01:34:07.794
You made it!

01:34:08.900 --> 01:34:11.892
No one back at Tri-Oceanic
believed me.

01:34:11.969 --> 01:34:16.338
But I never gave up on you once.
How do you feel?

01:34:17.475 --> 01:34:19.909
Better. A lot better.
