00:28.853 --> 00:33.768
Detective Sipowicz, tell the court
how you arrested Mr. Giardella.

00:34.013 --> 00:39.565
This past August 27, l was surveilling
the defendant, as he is a known felon.

00:39.813 --> 00:44.603
During the surveillance l observed the
defendant's car having a flat tire.

00:44.853 --> 00:47.242
He got out and opened the trunk.

00:47.733 --> 00:51.612
l approached the car, identified
myself as a police officer. . .

00:51.813 --> 00:56.933
. . .and through casual observation
l saw 27 cartons of cigarettes. . .

00:57.453 --> 00:59.967
. . .which did not have tax stamps.

01:00.173 --> 01:06.009
l ascertained it was his car, gave him
his rights and took him into custody.

01:06.213 --> 01:10.968
-Nothing further, Your Honor.
SlNCLAlR: Detective Sipowicz. . .

01:12.453 --> 01:17.607
. . .you testified that the cigarettes
for which you arrested my client. . .

01:17.853 --> 01:23.052
. . .were in plain sight in his trunk
when he opened it to get out a jack?

01:23.253 --> 01:24.766
-Right.
-Now. . .

01:24.973 --> 01:29.922
. . .there were seven nails
in Mr. Giardella's right rear radial.

01:30.253 --> 01:33.051
That wouldn't exactly produce
a slow leak.

01:33.253 --> 01:37.405
Yet you say, during several hours
of antecedent surveillance. . .

01:37.573 --> 01:40.371
. . .you saw no one damage his tire.

01:40.613 --> 01:44.208
l was surveilling Mr. Giardella,
not his car.

01:44.613 --> 01:46.968
He stopped at Niglio's Coffeehouse.

01:47.213 --> 01:52.241
Maybe some urban youths did mischief
to his vehicle during that time frame.

01:52.573 --> 01:56.009
SlNCLAlR:
Your Honor, justified or not. . .

01:56.253 --> 02:00.769
. . .the reputation of the neighborhood
around Niglio's Coffeehouse. . .

02:01.013 --> 02:06.212
. . .is such that urban youths do not
tend to do mischief in its environs.

02:06.413 --> 02:08.973
Maybe he drove past
a construction site.

02:09.133 --> 02:13.411
SlNCLAlR: However, Sipowicz here has
a vendetta against Mr. Giardella.

02:13.613 --> 02:18.403
l submit the true scenario is that
while my client stopped at Niglio's. . .

02:18.573 --> 02:22.088
. . .Sipowicz hammered nails
into his tire to cause a flat. . .

02:22.453 --> 02:26.048
. . .so when Mr. Giardella stopped
to get out a spare. . .

02:26.253 --> 02:29.450
. . .he could circumvent
probable-cause statutes. . .

02:29.613 --> 02:34.403
. . .and go fishing inside
Mr. Giardella's trunk.

02:34.573 --> 02:38.122
Move to suppress the evidence
as tainted and dismiss the complaint.

02:38.293 --> 02:39.567
Granted.

02:39.773 --> 02:44.847

-Pathetic. Adjourned.
