00:21.819 --> 00:23.386
What the hell is that?

00:23.387 --> 00:24.655
Oh, sorry.

00:24.656 --> 00:27.557
I set my alarm so I could go
home before Jake wakes up.

00:27.558 --> 00:28.859
Turn it off!

00:30.361 --> 00:33.530
I'm trying, but
my arm's asleep.

00:36.084 --> 00:38.535
Aah. There. Whew.

00:38.536 --> 00:40.570
I can't believe
you have a watch alarm.

00:40.571 --> 00:41.672
Yeah, it's a Timex.

00:41.673 --> 00:43.757
Well, a really
nice knockoff.

00:43.758 --> 00:46.376
Even has indiglo.
See?

00:46.377 --> 00:49.513
Oh! Oh, for God's sake,
it's 6:00 a.m.

00:49.514 --> 00:51.214
Oh, I know, sorry.

00:51.215 --> 00:53.083
We agreed we don't want
our kids to know about us.

00:53.084 --> 00:54.468
Yeah, yeah, good-bye.

00:54.469 --> 00:55.802
Bye.

01:01.109 --> 01:03.310
Guess a little morning quickie
is out of the question.

01:03.311 --> 01:06.396
If you can do it
without waking me up.

01:09.350 --> 01:11.168
You're not really
thinking about it, are you?

01:13.437 --> 01:15.739
âª <i>Men.</i> âª

01:27.385 --> 01:28.635
Dear Lord.

01:28.636 --> 01:29.753
Charlie?

01:29.754 --> 01:30.971
Huh?

01:31.773 --> 01:33.223
You okay?

01:33.224 --> 01:35.425
Sure.

01:36.677 --> 01:38.478
Why do you ask?

01:38.479 --> 01:41.048
'Cause... you're passed out on
the stairs.

01:41.049 --> 01:43.900
Really?

01:49.023 --> 01:51.191
Oh, that's not good.

01:51.192 --> 01:54.077
How much did you have
to drink last night?

01:54.078 --> 01:56.279
Let's see...

02:10.544 --> 02:12.295
I don't know.

02:15.333 --> 02:19.386
I wonder how I got my pants off
over my shoes.

02:19.387 --> 02:22.639
Maybe you took your shoes off,
and then put them back on.

02:22.640 --> 02:24.391
Think it through, Alan.

02:24.392 --> 02:26.059
For what possible activity

02:26.060 --> 02:28.895
would I need my pants off
and my shoes on?

02:28.896 --> 02:30.063
I don't know.

02:30.064 --> 02:31.782
Chasing a reluctant hooker?

02:34.552 --> 02:36.753
Can't rule it out.

02:37.705 --> 02:39.823
So... where have you been?

02:39.824 --> 02:41.191
I was with Lyndsey.

02:41.192 --> 02:42.959
Who's Lyndsey?

02:42.960 --> 02:44.377
Eldridge's mom.

02:45.296 --> 02:46.279
Who's Eldridge?

02:46.280 --> 02:47.581
Jake's friend?

02:48.666 --> 02:50.033
Jake is my son.

02:50.034 --> 02:53.670
I know who Jake is.

02:53.671 --> 02:57.591
What I don't know is
where my pants are.

02:57.592 --> 02:58.975
Excuse me.

03:20.114 --> 03:22.999
Guess who had
a Cobb salad for dinner.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.568
Charming. I'm, uh,
I'm going to go lay down.

03:25.569 --> 03:29.289
You know, Jake may not be the
brightest monkey in the meadow,

03:29.290 --> 03:31.458
but even he's going to
eventually figure out

03:31.459 --> 03:33.009
that you're banging
his buddy's mom.

03:33.010 --> 03:35.345
Don't worry. I'll tell him
when the time is right.

03:35.346 --> 03:36.412
And when is that?

03:36.413 --> 03:37.964
When I'm sure
that Lyndsey and I

03:37.965 --> 03:39.582
have built a solid relationship
that will last.

03:39.583 --> 03:40.934
In the meantime,

03:40.935 --> 03:42.886
I don't want to complicate his
friendship with Eldridge.

03:42.887 --> 03:44.521
Lyndsey's son, right?

03:44.522 --> 03:45.438
Right.

03:45.439 --> 03:47.224
Ha!

03:48.425 --> 03:50.110
Yeah. Yeah, very good.

03:50.111 --> 03:53.096
The point is, I haven't
said anything to Jake because

03:53.097 --> 03:55.198
in a lot of ways, he's
still a little boy.

03:55.199 --> 03:58.818
He's not very sophisticated when
it comes to adult sexual...

04:00.037 --> 04:01.905
...relationships.

04:08.162 --> 04:10.380
Yours?

04:12.533 --> 04:15.552
Alan, she's like, 16.

04:15.553 --> 04:17.704
And... again I ask--

04:17.704 --> 04:20.891
hoping I won't be
called to testify...

04:22.459 --> 04:23.560
Yours?

04:23.561 --> 04:26.179
No, she's coming
from Jake's room.

04:26.180 --> 04:27.898
Why would a girl
be leaving Jake's room

04:27.899 --> 04:28.965
at 7:00 in the morning?

04:28.966 --> 04:30.233
Why do you think?

04:30.234 --> 04:32.602
Oh, come on! He's 16!

04:32.603 --> 04:34.971
Not everybody waits till they're
a junior in college, Alan!

04:34.972 --> 04:38.658
A sophomore, and I still
wasn't emotionally ready.

04:38.659 --> 04:41.695
Well, obviously your kid's
a little more advanced.

04:41.696 --> 04:43.479
No. No, this
is unacceptable.

04:43.480 --> 04:46.666
He and I are going to
have to have a little talk.

04:52.656 --> 04:55.175
Maybe he can
give you some tips.

04:55.176 --> 04:57.594
âª Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men âª

04:57.595 --> 05:00.864
âª Ah. âª
âª Men. âª
âª Men. âª

05:02.244 --> 05:03.294
âª <i>Men.</i> âª

05:03.870 --> 05:04.987
Unbelievable.

05:04.988 --> 05:07.839
My little boy spent
the night with two girls.

05:07.840 --> 05:09.708
Two so far.

05:11.127 --> 05:12.160
What?

05:12.161 --> 05:13.712
We don't have
a final tally.

05:13.713 --> 05:16.248
There might be more
clowns in that car.

05:16.249 --> 05:18.200
You think?

05:18.201 --> 05:20.369
At this point,
anything's possible.

05:20.370 --> 05:22.087
There's only one
way to find out.

05:22.088 --> 05:23.088
Hang on, hang on.

05:23.089 --> 05:25.224
Come here.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.125
Let's think
this through.

05:27.126 --> 05:28.310
What is there to think through?

05:28.311 --> 05:30.962
The possibility of my son
hosting an orgy?

05:30.963 --> 05:33.732
Now, not to be a stickler,

05:33.733 --> 05:37.552
but technically an orgy requires
a minimum of six participants.

05:37.553 --> 05:38.720
What?

05:38.721 --> 05:41.823
It goes... masturbation,
one-on-one, threesome,

05:41.824 --> 05:43.158
two couples swinging,

05:43.159 --> 05:45.911
two couples swinging
with a looky-loo, orgy's six.

05:46.696 --> 05:48.363
It frightens me
that you know that.

05:48.364 --> 05:50.499
Everybody knows that.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.485
Well, whatever you call it, it
needs to be nipped in the bud.

05:53.486 --> 05:56.255
Now we're talking three girls
and a guy named Bud.

05:57.823 --> 06:00.158
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:00.159 --> 06:01.826
What are you gonna do?
Punish him?

06:01.827 --> 06:03.929
Well, what do you want me
to do? Give him a merit badge?

06:03.930 --> 06:05.797
Well, it is quite
an accomplishment.

06:05.798 --> 06:07.299
This is not funny, Charlie!

06:07.300 --> 06:08.383
Hey, I'm not laughing.

06:08.384 --> 06:10.001
The kid's doing
better than I am.

06:10.002 --> 06:12.003
I woke up on
the stairs alone.

06:12.004 --> 06:14.640
Oh, you're up.

06:14.641 --> 06:16.775
These were in the mailbox.

06:18.895 --> 06:20.845
What the hell were they
doing in the mailbox?

06:20.846 --> 06:22.814
I don't know, but
there's postage on 'em.

06:28.905 --> 06:32.157
Well, I clearly had
a plan of some kind.

06:32.158 --> 06:34.192
What's everybody
doing up so early?

06:34.193 --> 06:36.795
We just saw two girls
sneaking out of Jake's room.

06:36.796 --> 06:37.829
Two?

06:37.830 --> 06:39.448
Two.

06:39.449 --> 06:41.366
Taterhead had a threesome?

06:43.002 --> 06:45.003
We don't know that.

06:45.004 --> 06:47.589
Maybe they were having an
all-night study session.

06:48.891 --> 06:51.259
My God, he had a threesome.

06:52.712 --> 06:53.929
Morning.

06:53.930 --> 06:55.681
Morning.
Morning.
Morning.

07:07.727 --> 07:08.960
Hungry?

07:08.961 --> 07:10.145
Yep.

07:10.146 --> 07:10.996
Thirsty?

07:10.997 --> 07:12.064
Mm-hmm.

07:12.065 --> 07:13.148
Proud?

07:13.149 --> 07:15.066
What?

07:15.067 --> 07:16.084
Ignore him.

07:16.085 --> 07:18.337
So, what'd you wind
up doing last night?

07:18.338 --> 07:19.338
Nothin'.

07:19.339 --> 07:21.340
Nothing, you say.

07:21.341 --> 07:23.542
So, just an evening
alone in your room.

07:23.543 --> 07:24.409
Pretty much.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.712
Quiet? Uneventful?

07:27.797 --> 07:29.014
Boring?

07:29.816 --> 07:30.782
I guess.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.301
Nothing I have
to clean up?

07:33.302 --> 07:36.588
Nope. Wait... I did
have a sandwich in bed.

07:36.589 --> 07:38.473
I knew it!

07:40.560 --> 07:42.361
What are you talking about?

07:42.362 --> 07:43.879
We saw the girls, Jake.

07:45.048 --> 07:47.215
Well, this is awkward.

07:48.401 --> 07:51.403
Two hotties, sneaking out of
your room. Up top, little stud!

07:51.404 --> 07:52.537
Charlie!

07:52.538 --> 07:54.456
This does not call
for a high-five.

07:54.457 --> 07:55.741
You're right.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.743
It's hugging time.
Come here, you dog.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.995
Stop it! Stop it!
Stop it.

07:59.996 --> 08:02.497
I want to know what those
girls were doing in your room.

08:02.498 --> 08:04.633
He told you: They were
making a sandwich.

08:04.634 --> 08:06.885
Would you please?!

08:06.886 --> 08:08.920
I am waiting for an answer.

08:08.921 --> 08:11.089
All right. Their names
were Tiffany and Joanne,

08:11.090 --> 08:13.058
and they're from my school
and they're into surfing.

08:13.059 --> 08:16.061
Terrific. So what were
they doing in your room!?

08:16.062 --> 08:18.397
Hey, chill!
I'm gettin' to it.

08:18.398 --> 08:19.347
Yeah, chill!

08:19.348 --> 08:20.799
He's gettin' to it.

08:22.151 --> 08:24.486
They were going to
sleep in their car so
they could hit the waves

08:24.487 --> 08:26.888
as soon as the sun came
up, and I said they
could crash here.

08:26.889 --> 08:28.190
So...

08:28.191 --> 08:29.441
nothing happened?

08:29.442 --> 08:31.843
No, we're just friends.
I slept on the floor.

08:31.844 --> 08:33.861
Aww...
Aww...

08:33.863 --> 08:35.030
This is not "Aww."

08:35.030 --> 08:37.082
This is "Yay!"

08:38.049 --> 08:39.366
Yay.
Yay.

08:39.368 --> 08:42.020
So when I asked you about
last night, why did you lie?

08:42.020 --> 08:44.473
It's usually
the simpler path.

08:44.474 --> 08:46.792
And, and why didn't you
ask permission

08:46.793 --> 08:48.126
before asking
your friends over?

08:48.127 --> 08:49.060
You weren't around.

08:49.061 --> 08:50.495
Where were you,
by the way?

08:54.016 --> 08:56.051
I went to the gym.

08:57.437 --> 08:58.804
A little, little cardio, uh,

08:58.805 --> 09:00.939
spinning class,
light weights, uh,

09:00.940 --> 09:03.174
you know, I'm just into
maintenance, not bulking up.

09:03.175 --> 09:04.893
Don't find that attractive.

09:04.894 --> 09:06.812
I prefer the lean, mean
swimmer's body.

09:06.813 --> 09:08.697
You know, like...

09:08.698 --> 09:10.198
Jesus.

09:10.199 --> 09:13.351
Nice, Alan.
Drag our Lord into it.

09:13.352 --> 09:15.821
Anyway, you still
could've called me.

09:15.822 --> 09:16.822
Or-Or asked your uncle.

09:16.823 --> 09:18.073
You didn't answer your phone,

09:18.074 --> 09:20.041
and Uncle Charlie was busy
trying to mail his pants.

09:20.042 --> 09:21.877
Oh good, good,
you saw that.

09:21.878 --> 09:23.912
Did I happen to mention
why I was doing it?

09:23.913 --> 09:25.029
Nope.

09:25.030 --> 09:26.331
And you didn't ask?

09:26.332 --> 09:29.134
Over the years I've learned
to look the other way.

09:29.135 --> 09:30.719
All right, all right, let's...
let's not get off-track here.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.420
The important thing is
that if you're gonna

09:32.421 --> 09:34.639
have company,
you give one of us a heads-up.

09:34.640 --> 09:35.874
Fine.

09:35.875 --> 09:36.925
Oh, hey, look.

09:36.926 --> 09:39.344
There's a note in my pocket.

09:43.099 --> 09:45.600
"Dear Inspected By Number 94...

09:45.601 --> 09:49.437
"It is with a heavy heart
that I write to you.

09:49.438 --> 09:54.860
"The zipper you signed off
on has snagged my ball sack.

09:57.697 --> 10:00.932
"Thank you for your prompt
attention to this matter.

10:00.933 --> 10:04.786
Sincerely yours,
Charles Francis Harper."

10:05.922 --> 10:09.174
Well, that explains
the blood in my shorts.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.928
I hope.

10:17.300 --> 10:20.535
I've got a
little surprise for you!

10:20.536 --> 10:22.470
Well, I've got a--

10:22.471 --> 10:26.308
what I'm told is a perfectly
adequate surprise for you.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.694
You like?

10:29.695 --> 10:31.930
Oh, yes.

10:31.931 --> 10:34.933
Your surprise has greatly
enhanced my surprise.

10:36.285 --> 10:40.622
Oh, is that whipped cream, or
are you planning to shave me?

10:41.541 --> 10:43.241
I mean, y'know,
I'm fine either way.

10:43.242 --> 10:45.109
It's whipped cream, Alan.

10:45.110 --> 10:47.045
Oh, okay. Uh, fat-free?

10:47.046 --> 10:48.947
'Cause I'm trying
to cut down.

10:48.948 --> 10:52.951
Relax. You're not going to
be the one licking it up.

10:55.171 --> 10:56.388
Oh!

10:58.290 --> 10:59.558
Well, bon appetit.

11:02.127 --> 11:03.178
Ma!

11:03.179 --> 11:04.479
Damn.

11:04.480 --> 11:06.881
Eldridge! Why aren't
you in school?

11:06.882 --> 11:09.084
It's a half day!
Teachers' conference.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.485
How come I didn't
know about that?

11:10.486 --> 11:11.820
I don't know.

11:11.821 --> 11:13.738
Jake's gonna
stay for dinner, okay?

11:13.739 --> 11:16.575
Uh... did he ask his dad?

11:16.576 --> 11:19.244
Yes, Mrs. MacElroy,
he said it's fine.

11:19.245 --> 11:21.112
No, he didn't, he's
totally lying!

11:21.113 --> 11:22.080
Shh!

11:22.081 --> 11:24.249
He's been lying
a lot lately.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.752
Boy, you try to bring a
kid up with some values.

11:27.753 --> 11:29.153
Hand me a tissue,
will you?

11:29.154 --> 11:31.790
The whipped cream's
dripping into my crack.
Okay.

11:31.791 --> 11:33.925
Want some pie?

11:33.926 --> 11:36.011
Sure. Got any
whipped cream?

11:36.012 --> 11:39.297
Usually we do.

11:39.298 --> 11:40.548
I don't see it.

11:40.549 --> 11:43.184
Man, we go through a lot of
whipped cream in this house.

11:55.031 --> 11:56.681
Was that my dad?

11:56.682 --> 11:58.650
âª <i>Men.</i> âª

12:01.640 --> 12:04.124
âª <i>Men.</i> âª

12:14.521 --> 12:15.788
Hi.

12:20.443 --> 12:21.977
Hello.

12:23.296 --> 12:25.297
Did you know Rottweilers
are attracted

12:25.298 --> 12:26.782
to the scent
of whipped cream?

12:26.783 --> 12:28.968
Matter of fact,
I did know that.

12:28.969 --> 12:30.920
Mmm.

12:30.921 --> 12:31.870
I just
learned it.

12:31.871 --> 12:34.139
Mmm.

12:34.140 --> 12:35.307
Jake almost
caught me

12:35.308 --> 12:37.092
sneaking out of
Lyndsey's house.

12:37.093 --> 12:38.143
Really?

12:38.144 --> 12:39.094
Close call.

12:39.095 --> 12:40.396
One question.

12:40.397 --> 12:41.397
Yeah?

12:41.398 --> 12:42.765
Whose idea was it to

12:42.766 --> 12:44.683
spice things up
with a large dog?

12:44.684 --> 12:47.653
The dog was not
with us in bed.

12:47.654 --> 12:49.104
The dog was
being walked

12:49.105 --> 12:50.322
by a nine-year-old girl

12:50.323 --> 12:52.825
who was not quite capable
of holding onto the leash

12:52.826 --> 12:54.777
when he got
a whiff of

12:54.778 --> 12:57.496
my non-fat,
dairy-scented crotch.

12:57.497 --> 13:00.616
Okay. Okay.

13:00.617 --> 13:02.585
I'm not judging,

13:02.586 --> 13:05.871
but why was a nine-year-
old girl walking her dog

13:05.872 --> 13:06.872
through
Lyndsey's bedroom?

13:06.873 --> 13:08.874
No. The girl
was on the street

13:08.875 --> 13:10.175
with the dog.

13:10.176 --> 13:11.176
Oh.
Hmm.

13:11.177 --> 13:12.294
All right,
another question.

13:12.295 --> 13:13.712
I was on the street

13:13.713 --> 13:15.714
'cause I was sneaking
out of Lyndsey's house.

13:15.715 --> 13:17.049
Ah!

13:17.050 --> 13:18.917
You know, for
such a boring guy,

13:18.918 --> 13:21.303
you lead a very
complicated life.

13:22.606 --> 13:27.259
Yeah, it's a
paradox, isn't it?

13:28.478 --> 13:30.462
Iced tea?

13:30.463 --> 13:32.448
I decided when you
try to mail your pants

13:32.449 --> 13:34.116
to a garment
inspector in Malaysia,

13:34.117 --> 13:36.485
it's time to
quit drinking.

13:41.625 --> 13:43.292
Some might say that
day came and went

13:43.293 --> 13:45.711
when you gave
yourself that haircut.

13:48.381 --> 13:50.633
But good for you.

13:50.634 --> 13:52.134
Yep.

13:52.135 --> 13:54.553
Long overdue.

13:54.554 --> 13:55.787
You want a beer?

13:55.788 --> 13:57.590
You just said
you were quitting.

13:58.458 --> 14:00.259
I did. And I am.

14:00.260 --> 14:02.511
My drinking
days are over.

14:03.296 --> 14:05.097
See?
Beer.

14:09.185 --> 14:10.185
Hello?

14:10.186 --> 14:11.904
Uh... uh... in here!

14:11.905 --> 14:13.939
Ixnay on the
ottweiler-Ray!

14:13.940 --> 14:15.274
What?

14:15.275 --> 14:16.942
The oggy-day who tried
to ite-bay my alls-bay.

14:16.943 --> 14:18.243
Hey, buddy!

14:18.244 --> 14:20.145
I'm not
your buddy.

14:20.146 --> 14:20.946
What?

14:20.947 --> 14:22.247
I just came to
get my stuff.

14:22.248 --> 14:23.949
I'm staying with Mom
and Herb from now on.

14:23.950 --> 14:24.783
Why?

14:24.784 --> 14:26.118
I saw you sneaking out

14:26.119 --> 14:27.119
of Eldridge's house.

14:27.120 --> 14:30.706
Oh, Alan, no!

14:30.707 --> 14:34.159
Are you crazy, having sex
with my best friend's mom?

14:34.160 --> 14:37.096
Shame on you!

14:37.097 --> 14:38.547
I had no
idea, Jake.

14:38.548 --> 14:40.799
I, I, I, I was
gonna tell you,

14:40.800 --> 14:41.833
you know, eventually.

14:41.834 --> 14:43.435
You're such a liar.

14:43.436 --> 14:45.220
Oh, oh, oh, <i>I'm</i> a liar?

14:45.221 --> 14:47.806
What were you doing at
Eldridge's in the first place?

14:47.807 --> 14:50.893
You certainly didn't
ask permission from me!

14:52.062 --> 14:54.279
Attaboy.

14:54.280 --> 14:56.281
Trying to take
the high road

14:56.282 --> 14:59.618
with a crotch full of whipped
cream and dog spittle.

14:59.619 --> 15:01.954
âª <i>Men.</i>  âª

15:03.089 --> 15:04.873
Ah.

15:04.874 --> 15:07.526
You know, I feel a lot better
since I've stopped drinking.

15:10.413 --> 15:12.898
Yeah, we're all
proud of you.

15:12.899 --> 15:14.533
I have
more energy,

15:14.534 --> 15:16.251
I'm certainly
more clear-headed.

15:16.252 --> 15:17.469
In fact, the
only downside is

15:17.470 --> 15:19.254
I might have to put a
chip clip on my johnson

15:19.255 --> 15:21.840
to keep from
peeing my pants.

15:22.642 --> 15:24.226
I really screwed up, Charlie.

15:24.227 --> 15:26.378
I should've been honest
with Jake from the beginning.

15:26.379 --> 15:28.180
Just told him I was
seeing his friend's mother.

15:28.181 --> 15:30.933
Or, you could've not slept
with his friend's mother

15:30.934 --> 15:31.984
in the first place.

15:31.985 --> 15:33.602
Really?

15:33.603 --> 15:35.738
You're going to preach
sexual restraint to me?

15:35.739 --> 15:38.907
Let me explain
something to you, Alan.

15:38.908 --> 15:41.060
Jake expects me
to betray his trust.

15:41.061 --> 15:43.529
You, on the other hand, are
held to a higher standard.

15:43.530 --> 15:45.247
Is that so?
It is!

15:45.248 --> 15:47.399
You're like some
kind of right-wing,

15:47.400 --> 15:49.084
pro-family
values senator,

15:49.085 --> 15:50.919
caught on his knees
in an airport toilet

15:50.920 --> 15:52.388
with a
male hooker.

15:52.389 --> 15:55.174
Whereas I am a
well-known rascal.

15:56.342 --> 15:58.177
When I don't do
the wrong thing,

15:58.178 --> 15:59.628
people are
disappointed.

15:59.629 --> 16:02.080
Is that supposed to
make me feel better?

16:02.081 --> 16:04.133
No, the story was about me.

16:04.134 --> 16:06.185
God, you're such
a narcissist.

16:06.186 --> 16:09.354
You know what, I can't just
sit here and do nothing.

16:09.355 --> 16:11.423
I owe Jake an apology.

16:11.424 --> 16:13.525
You're going to Judith's?
I'll come with you.

16:13.526 --> 16:15.778
Why?
Why?

16:15.779 --> 16:17.813
You're my brother,
I want to support you.

16:17.814 --> 16:19.982
Really?
Nah, I'm just outta beer.

16:21.901 --> 16:24.119
But I do love that you
still fall for that.

16:24.120 --> 16:27.372
âª <i>Men.</i> âª

16:27.373 --> 16:29.408
Well, I hope you're
proud of yourself.

16:29.409 --> 16:31.777
I am. I haven't
had a drink all day.

16:31.778 --> 16:33.579
She was talking
to me, Charlie,

16:33.580 --> 16:34.963
and no, I'm not.

16:34.964 --> 16:36.131
Okay, Millie's
finally asleep.

16:36.132 --> 16:39.718
Ooh, is
that real beer?

16:39.719 --> 16:40.886
Knock yourself out.

16:40.887 --> 16:43.555
Oh, thanks! I'm gonna regret
this in the morning.

16:45.124 --> 16:48.761
My God, Alan, I can't
believe you're sleeping
with Lyndsey MacElroy.

16:48.762 --> 16:50.962
You're sleeping with
Lyndsey MacElroy?

16:52.265 --> 16:53.899
My man!

16:53.900 --> 16:55.317
How could
you do that?

16:55.318 --> 16:56.485
Yeah, how?

16:56.486 --> 16:59.104
Don't leave
anything out.

16:59.105 --> 17:00.773
Well, it just happened.

17:00.774 --> 17:03.242
Her son and Jake are friends,
which is how we met,

17:03.243 --> 17:04.810
and we, you know, hit it off.

17:04.810 --> 17:07.479
You don't sleep with
your son's friend's mother.

17:07.480 --> 17:08.579
No, no.

17:08.580 --> 17:11.282
You marry his pediatrician.

17:15.038 --> 17:18.207
He's got you
there, sweetie.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.526
You know, there's
a rumor going around

17:20.527 --> 17:22.594
that Lyndsey was in
a soft-core porn movie

17:22.595 --> 17:23.628
before she got married.

17:23.630 --> 17:24.930
Really? Which one?

17:24.931 --> 17:27.215
I don't know, but I've
been checking Cinemax

17:27.217 --> 17:28.282
every night for months.

17:28.284 --> 17:29.935
Oh, I love their stuff.

17:29.936 --> 17:31.019
It's classy, right?

17:31.020 --> 17:33.021
A little story,
nice lighting,

17:33.022 --> 17:36.441
and you never have to
see the guy's junk.

17:36.442 --> 17:38.076
What is
wrong with you?

17:38.077 --> 17:40.729
You don't like seeing
that stuff, either.

17:42.465 --> 17:44.199
I think that's
enough beer, sweetheart.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.484
I'll get Jake.

17:45.485 --> 17:47.703
There you go, pal.

17:47.704 --> 17:49.688
Thanks, but you heard her.
I've had enough.

17:51.524 --> 17:54.910
Boy, oh, boy,
Lyndsey MacElroy.

17:54.911 --> 17:56.278
You are one lucky ducky.

17:56.279 --> 17:58.831
Yeah, she's very beautiful.

17:58.832 --> 18:00.833
You know, sometimes
I drive past her house

18:00.834 --> 18:03.302
and she's out watering her
lawn in her shorty shorts

18:03.303 --> 18:04.553
and her halter top.

18:04.554 --> 18:06.138
Cowabunga!

18:07.340 --> 18:09.174
No one wants
to talk to him,

18:09.175 --> 18:11.059
but he's your father.

18:11.060 --> 18:12.644
Oh, hey, buddy.

18:12.645 --> 18:13.679
What do
you want?

18:13.680 --> 18:15.848
What I want is to apologize

18:15.849 --> 18:18.066
for not telling you about
me and Eldridge's mom.

18:18.067 --> 18:19.852
You know, this is
between you guys.

18:19.853 --> 18:22.020
I'm just gonna go
take a hot shower.

18:24.190 --> 18:26.358
Eldridge doesn't want to
be friends with me anymore.

18:26.359 --> 18:29.077
Oh, I am so sorry.
But, but this can't
be the first time

18:29.078 --> 18:30.362
something like this
has happened.

18:30.363 --> 18:32.197
I mean, how many times
has your Uncle Charlie

18:32.198 --> 18:33.248
slept with
somebody you knew?

18:33.249 --> 18:35.734
Yeah, but I expect
that from him.

18:35.735 --> 18:38.670
See, Alan? I'm Teflon.

18:39.973 --> 18:42.958
You're a perv,
is what you are.

18:44.410 --> 18:46.094
And it's not just that
you were sleeping with her,

18:46.095 --> 18:47.429
it's that you
lied to me about it.

18:47.430 --> 18:48.764
You're right.

18:48.765 --> 18:50.465
I should've told
you the truth.

18:50.466 --> 18:52.267
And, and Lyndsey
should've told Eldridge.

18:52.268 --> 18:54.519
But when it happened, we didn't
know if it would even last.

18:54.520 --> 18:56.555
I just don't like you
keeping things from me.

18:56.556 --> 18:58.557
That's fair, and, and,
and I'll make you a deal.

18:58.558 --> 19:01.226
From now on, I will be
open and honest with you

19:01.227 --> 19:02.527
and you'll do
the same with me.

19:02.528 --> 19:04.880
Deal?
I guess.

19:04.881 --> 19:06.281
Thanks.

19:06.282 --> 19:08.233
I have to go
finish my homework.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.152
Okay. So, uh... I'll
see you this weekend?

19:10.153 --> 19:11.069
Sure.

19:11.070 --> 19:13.104
Great.
Love you, buddy.

19:13.105 --> 19:14.706
Don't push it, Dad.

19:15.541 --> 19:17.542
You're lucky
he's so forgiving.

19:17.543 --> 19:19.244
Takes after his mom, huh?

19:20.613 --> 19:22.948
Um, you know,
we should go.

19:23.750 --> 19:25.417
I gotta pee.
You mind, Judith?

19:25.418 --> 19:27.219
Just try to hit
the bowl this time.

19:27.220 --> 19:30.505
Don't worry, I only miss
when I've been drinking.

19:30.506 --> 19:33.792
I'll wait in the car.

19:33.793 --> 19:35.227
Hey, Judith?

19:36.312 --> 19:38.129
Is there surfing
around here?

19:38.130 --> 19:39.314
What are you talking about?

19:39.315 --> 19:40.549
We're 20 miles
from the beach.

19:40.550 --> 19:42.267
That's what I thought.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.819
I am so proud of that kid.

19:43.820 --> 19:46.304
âª <i>Men.</i> âª

19:48.823 --> 19:50.440
Isn't this nice?

19:50.441 --> 19:52.943
The four of us sitting
down, having dinner.

19:52.944 --> 19:54.928
Open.
Honest.

19:54.929 --> 19:55.996
No secrets.

19:55.997 --> 19:57.781
Yeah.
Thrilling.

19:59.033 --> 20:00.417
So, Jake, your dad tells me

20:00.418 --> 20:02.252
you're getting into
the surfing scene?

20:02.253 --> 20:03.203
What do you mean?

20:03.204 --> 20:04.671
You know, uh,
Tiffany and Joanne.

20:04.672 --> 20:06.173
Oh, yeah.
Right.

20:06.174 --> 20:07.707
Tiffany and Joanne surf?

20:07.708 --> 20:10.710
Yes, Eldridge.
They surf.

20:12.029 --> 20:13.930
Charlie? Would you
like some pizza?

20:13.931 --> 20:15.565
No, thanks.

20:15.566 --> 20:17.801
I'm kinda on a health kick.

20:18.886 --> 20:21.421
Didn't you tell me
he quit drinking?

20:21.422 --> 20:23.673
He actually thinks he did.

20:27.678 --> 20:28.728
Hello?

20:28.729 --> 20:31.514
Oh, hey, Herb!
S'up?

20:31.515 --> 20:32.299
Really?

20:32.300 --> 20:34.234
Right now?

20:34.235 --> 20:36.519
Hang on.

20:40.825 --> 20:41.708
Are you sure?

20:41.709 --> 20:43.210
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:43.211 --> 20:44.794
Lyndsey?

20:44.795 --> 20:45.829
Hmm?

20:45.830 --> 20:47.530
Never mind.

20:47.531 --> 20:50.366
You're right, it's her!

20:51.252 --> 20:53.420
Okay, Herb. Thanks.

20:53.421 --> 20:55.639
Great. Have a nice shower.

21:01.746 --> 21:04.681
Boy, she sure does
like the whipped cream.
