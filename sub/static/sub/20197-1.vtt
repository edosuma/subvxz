03:08.100 --> 03:10.590
Hey, you there, where do you think you're looking?!

03:10.700 --> 03:12.000
Huh?

03:12.100 --> 03:15.370
Who the hell are you? You dare to ignore us?

03:15.770 --> 03:18.800
What's wrong, say something!

03:23.550 --> 03:26.810
Something's off with that guy...

03:28.720 --> 03:31.240
Take a long hard look at that!

03:31.790 --> 03:34.550
What do you think that is?

03:34.790 --> 03:37.380
Answer me!

03:37.490 --> 03:42.400
That is an offering to a kid who died here not too long ago...

03:42.730 --> 03:43.860
Correct!

03:46.540 --> 03:50.560
And why was the vase not standing?

03:51.640 --> 03:55.270
We must have knocked it down accidentally.

03:55.580 --> 03:56.910
Got that right again.

03:57.210 --> 04:00.110
Well, apologize to him then.

04:00.450 --> 04:04.320
Him?

04:04.940 --> 04:06.490
Uhmm...

04:07.950 --> 04:09.530
I said, apologize!

04:09.660 --> 04:13.040
We're really sorry! Forgive us!

04:20.750 --> 04:21.839
Thank you.

04:24.550 --> 04:26.220
It's okay now.

04:28.040 --> 04:29.420
Did I scare you?

04:31.760 --> 04:36.020
The flowers your parents gave you are all ruin.

04:36.350 --> 04:37.480
You know?

04:37.600 --> 04:41.480
I know they love you very much.

04:41.900 --> 04:44.320
That's why you couldn't bear to leave, right?

04:44.320 --> 04:45.610
Yeah.

04:46.940 --> 04:50.990
But if you you keep staying here...

04:51.870 --> 04:54.450
People will come and bring me to hell?

04:55.080 --> 04:56.950
It's not that...

04:57.080 --> 05:00.420
Your parents will be worried about you.

05:01.380 --> 05:02.880
I see.

05:03.000 --> 05:07.220
That's why you should go to Soul Society.

05:07.420 --> 05:08.550
I understand now.

05:08.630 --> 05:12.600
I'll just go see my mama and papa 
one last time before I leave.

05:35.370 --> 05:37.120
Good morning!

05:37.620 --> 05:40.040
Ichigo...

05:41.040 --> 05:42.250
Irritating!

05:44.590 --> 05:45.840
Not again...

05:46.500 --> 05:49.220
My son, you're getting better...

05:49.300 --> 05:52.220
But how could you throw me to the ground?

05:52.340 --> 05:54.140
That is outrageous!

05:54.260 --> 05:57.930
How are you going to bond with me if you do that!

05:58.020 --> 06:01.140
One more time. Here I come!

06:01.230 --> 06:03.150
Stop going to far, okay?

06:05.940 --> 06:07.440
Here, brother.

06:07.530 --> 06:09.240
Thanks, Yuzu.

06:09.440 --> 06:12.820
Dad, if you don't eat you meal 
quick, you're going to be late.

06:13.110 --> 06:16.530
Dad is going out?

06:17.700 --> 06:20.040
He is joining the Resident Clinic Committee.

06:20.160 --> 06:23.540
I know you guys are worried about me. 
I'll buy you all something when I return.

06:23.670 --> 06:26.590
Ichigo, I'll leave you to take care of your sisters.

06:27.460 --> 06:30.720
My wife, I'll be home soon!

06:30.840 --> 06:33.550
It's about time you take down that portrait...

06:34.180 --> 06:37.810
Okay, that's about it. I'm off.

06:37.890 --> 06:40.980
Be careful.

06:41.060 --> 06:43.850
Brother, who would you like to eat for dinner?

06:43.980 --> 06:49.360
Since dad isn't around, I make something that you like.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.900
Anything will do.

06:52.030 --> 06:55.410
Ichigo, it's hard to come by, why don't you pick something?

06:55.870 --> 06:58.330
Okay.

06:58.910 --> 07:00.540
How about curry?

07:00.790 --> 07:05.250
Isn't that the usual?

07:05.380 --> 07:07.630
I've have curry too.

07:07.750 --> 07:11.670
You know I can make something more sumptuous.

07:11.760 --> 07:17.440
That's true, but your curry is really good, I really like it.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.980
Where is he?

07:28.650 --> 07:30.230
Ichigo.

07:31.570 --> 07:32.990
Rukia, Renji?

07:35.240 --> 07:37.280
When did you guys come over?

07:37.410 --> 07:38.450
A while back.

07:38.570 --> 07:41.620
What is this? Why didn't you call me?

07:41.910 --> 07:44.000
Sorry, it's an impromptu mission.

07:44.250 --> 07:47.630
More importantly, what are you doing here?

07:47.790 --> 07:52.300
Well... I was thinking adding a fresh stock of flower for the spirit.

07:52.920 --> 07:55.590
But it seems like he has crossed over.

07:55.880 --> 07:57.590
What?

07:57.720 --> 08:01.760
Isn't it your job to help the wandering spirits cross over?

08:01.850 --> 08:03.600
How can you lose them?

08:03.730 --> 08:07.230
What if they turn into Hollow? It's all your fault then!

08:07.520 --> 08:10.270
Huh, my job?

08:10.400 --> 08:13.320
That's the Shinigami's job.

08:13.440 --> 08:15.530
I'm just a Shinigami Proxy.

08:15.820 --> 08:17.160
What did you say?!

08:17.280 --> 08:18.740
Are you looking for a fight?

08:21.830 --> 08:25.290
Stop this instant, you bunch of idiots.

08:25.660 --> 08:28.880
I can't stand this, you guys are always like this...

08:28.950 --> 08:32.500
We didn't come to Karakura Town for fun.

08:32.630 --> 08:35.880
I know. Mission comes first, right?

08:35.970 --> 08:38.049
Mission? What mission?

08:38.760 --> 08:41.720
We do not need you on this task.

08:42.010 --> 08:44.470
But, if it is really something to do with...

08:44.770 --> 08:47.020
Didn't I say we'll do just fine?

08:47.140 --> 08:49.980
[ TL Note: "Nii-sama" here refers to Kuchiki Byakuya. ]

08:47.140 --> 08:54.320
Nii-sama keep telling me to keep you out of 
this, so that you don't get too carried away.

08:54.440 --> 08:56.650
Byakuya, that asshole...

08:56.990 --> 08:58.780
So, that's about it then.

08:58.860 --> 09:02.910
If we find that wandering spirit, 
we'll send him to Soul Society.

09:03.030 --> 09:05.160
You just go back to your studies.

09:05.660 --> 09:08.290
Yeah, sure thing.

09:13.540 --> 09:15.000
Morning.

09:15.130 --> 09:17.300
You're early today.

09:20.340 --> 09:23.300
Kurosaki-kun!

09:23.760 --> 09:25.720
Good morning!

09:25.810 --> 09:27.310
Yeah, morning.

09:33.270 --> 09:35.650
You didn't come with Tatsuki today?

09:35.730 --> 09:37.360
Tatsuki-chan went for her morning exercise.

10:06.390 --> 10:09.230
My... that was scary just now.

10:09.350 --> 10:11.560
Fortunately, nobody's got hurt.

10:11.690 --> 10:13.650
Are you really okay?

10:13.770 --> 10:15.570
Sado is amazing.

10:15.570 --> 10:17.900
What is this body made of?

10:18.150 --> 10:21.400
Ichigo, are you listening to me?!

10:21.490 --> 10:24.570
Sorry, I wasn't paying attention.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.240
It's okay, nothing he ever says was important.

10:28.330 --> 10:30.660
Stop, that's more applicable to you!

10:30.750 --> 10:33.080
It's up for me to decide if it's important?

10:33.460 --> 10:36.920
Yeah, yeah... So what are you getting at?

10:46.840 --> 10:49.550
There isn't any unusual Reiatsu...

10:49.920 --> 10:52.430
But it's too fishy the way it collapse.

10:53.140 --> 10:55.770
Maybe it's just an accident.

10:55.860 --> 10:57.730
I'm not too sure about that...

10:57.900 --> 10:59.900
You sensed something?

11:01.190 --> 11:03.740
It's just a trace, but it's there.

11:03.950 --> 11:07.780
It's something we have never encountered before.

11:08.490 --> 11:09.950
How so?

11:10.450 --> 11:11.330
I'm not sure...

11:12.370 --> 11:14.620
It's not a Hollow.

11:14.710 --> 11:18.880
Or a human like Sado or Inoue-san, 
with special abilities.

11:19.300 --> 11:21.880
And it's definitely not a Shinigami.

11:23.300 --> 11:26.970
Anyway, we know that something did happened.

11:27.140 --> 11:29.760
What's this...

11:34.440 --> 11:35.770
That Reiatsu...

11:35.850 --> 11:37.610
It's in the direction of Ichigo's school.

11:37.730 --> 11:38.650
Why Ichigo...

11:38.650 --> 11:39.770
Wait!

11:41.530 --> 11:44.700
There's another one.

11:44.820 --> 11:45.700
Yes.

11:46.280 --> 11:49.120
Renji, you go to the school,

11:49.700 --> 11:51.200
I'll check over there.

11:51.330 --> 11:53.710
Understood. Be careful.

11:53.870 --> 11:54.830
Yes.

12:01.030 --> 12:04.950
Tatsuki, hang in there, Tatsuki!

12:02.360 --> 12:04.570
Are you okay?

This guy...

12:43.840 --> 12:46.930
Inoue, take care of everybody.

12:55.020 --> 12:56.390
This fella...

12:56.480 --> 12:59.560
Kurosaki's Getsuga didn't even scratch him.

13:00.190 --> 13:01.360

You people are too slow.

What are they?

13:36.130 --> 13:38.180
This Reiatsu's from before...

Let's go.

13:47.240 --> 13:49.110
Thank you for the treat.

14:52.400 --> 14:54.430
Yeah, I'm still okay.

14:54.900 --> 14:57.900
The Shinigami is here.

14:58.440 --> 15:00.870
That's going to be a problem.

15:01.480 --> 15:02.670
Those guys...

15:02.780 --> 15:04.070
You know them?

15:04.750 --> 15:10.080
Yeah, seems like it's getting out of hand...

15:10.490 --> 15:13.650
You might not have notice it because of their presence,

15:13.770 --> 15:17.530
but just now, a similar Reiatsu appear elsewhere.

15:18.760 --> 15:21.750
It's located at Kurosaki Clinic, your home.

22:55.250 --> 22:56.550
That chain...

22:57.420 --> 22:58.910
Is it the hell's chain?

22:59.420 --> 23:00.790
What did you say?

23:01.720 --> 23:05.720
Yes, you're right. My name is Kokuto.

23:05.830 --> 23:08.350
As you can see, I'm a Sinner.

23:08.800 --> 23:12.600
So you and those in the black cloaks 
came from the same place?

23:12.700 --> 23:13.760
That's right.

23:14.140 --> 23:16.830
Why do you help us then, given that you're a Sinner?

23:17.670 --> 23:19.300
Help you?

23:20.210 --> 23:22.270
That's not exactly correct.

23:22.710 --> 23:26.480
I'm not helping you.

23:26.580 --> 23:28.950
I just dislike them.

23:29.480 --> 23:31.180
None of that is important.

23:31.720 --> 23:35.880
If you're a Sinner, you definitely know how to get into Hell.

23:36.290 --> 23:39.260
If that's the case, take me there.

23:40.230 --> 23:42.020
Or Yuzu might...

23:42.960 --> 23:44.950
...die, right?

23:49.500 --> 23:53.030
The air in Hell is like toxic gas to humans.

23:53.140 --> 23:56.740
If you don't quickly get your sister out, she will die.

24:00.510 --> 24:04.450
You Shinigami should have heard...

24:05.450 --> 24:07.680
...about how the Hell is like, right?

24:08.320 --> 24:10.920
Hell is a place for...

24:15.830 --> 24:20.390
those who can't get into Soul Society.

24:21.170 --> 24:26.200
It is a place to keep the souls of those who had 
committed heinous crimes when they were alive.

24:31.810 --> 24:34.280
For those that were exiled to hell,

24:34.420 --> 24:36.910
they were all chained up like sinners,

24:37.220 --> 24:41.920
tortured for all eternity to atone for their sins.

24:44.090 --> 24:49.320
Simply put, Hell is a place no ordinary person can stand.

24:50.700 --> 24:52.290
Do you still want to go, knowing all these?

24:52.770 --> 24:54.170
Of course!

24:54.470 --> 24:57.270
I can't abandon Yuzu there!

24:59.110 --> 25:05.110
Okay, if you're that resolute, 
no harm bringing you there.

25:05.200 --> 25:08.660
I'm doing this just to teach those idiots a lesson.

25:09.280 --> 25:12.660
With you around, I'm even more powerful.

25:14.370 --> 25:17.790
Why weren't you on the same side as them?

25:18.080 --> 25:21.800
Didn't I told you? I dislike them.

25:21.880 --> 25:25.340
You become enemy if you dislike each other.

25:25.880 --> 25:27.890
That's what Hell is like.

25:28.640 --> 25:31.060
Since you're condemn in Hell,

25:31.180 --> 25:34.640
you must have committed heinous crimes too, right?

25:34.850 --> 25:39.440
Indeed. I deserve to be in Hell for everything I've done.

25:39.560 --> 25:47.860
But there are also those who would betray their 
hearts to the darkness for the ones they loved.

25:49.240 --> 25:53.750
Alright, let's get going to Hell.

25:53.870 --> 25:54.500
Yeah.

25:54.700 --> 25:56.670
Wait.

25:56.830 --> 26:00.500
Are you really going to trust this dubious fella?

26:00.880 --> 26:06.260
I don't care if he is dubious or not, I've to get Yuzu back.

26:06.510 --> 26:09.260
For that, I need his help.

26:09.800 --> 26:12.470
Even if he's telling the truth,

26:12.560 --> 26:15.770
once you entered, isn't it playing 
into the hands of those fellas?

26:16.140 --> 26:20.230
I know that, but I still have to go.

26:21.150 --> 26:24.030
Then we're going too.

26:24.900 --> 26:25.940
Rukia...

26:26.900 --> 26:30.200
Hurry up and get ready.

26:30.570 --> 26:33.120
I'm opening the gate to Hell.

26:37.500 --> 26:41.420
Renji, when the time comes, 
you know what to do, right?

26:41.920 --> 26:48.050
Yeah. If I have to, I will use "that" 
to bring all of us back here.

26:49.260 --> 26:50.260
I'll entrust it to you.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.260
No big deal.

27:02.400 --> 27:07.240
Shuren-sama, it seems like they've entered Hell.

27:07.570 --> 27:11.450
Is that so? Is Murakumo back?

27:12.120 --> 27:15.620
No. He's taken by the Hell's Will.

27:15.740 --> 27:18.580
He's sinked to the dept of Hell.

27:19.210 --> 27:23.460
To revive him, we need a tremendous amount of time.

27:23.590 --> 27:25.500
He's always so rash...

27:25.630 --> 27:29.260
Go then, take Taikon and Garogai with you.

27:29.510 --> 27:30.470
Yes.

27:34.220 --> 27:37.140
Come, Kurosaki Ichigo.

27:38.310 --> 27:43.150
With your strength, we will be free again.

27:53.450 --> 27:56.080
Welcome to Hell.

27:56.870 --> 27:59.660
This is the entrance to Hell.

28:02.830 --> 28:06.840
This is far from what I had imagined.

28:07.170 --> 28:09.130
Is this your first time here too?

28:10.260 --> 28:12.800
Isn't Hell under the Shinigami's jurisdiction?

28:13.260 --> 28:16.930
No, it's under our surveillance.

28:17.640 --> 28:21.520
We're forbidden to intervene in 
anything that is related to Hell.

28:21.690 --> 28:24.980
But it feels really nauseating in here.

28:25.690 --> 28:31.320
In such an environment, anyone with a low Reiatsu would have fainted already.

28:31.900 --> 28:35.240

They give up fighting.

29:07.520 --> 29:09.400

29:09.520 --> 29:15.860
Yeah. Why do you think the Sinners in Hell still have thier powers?

29:17.030 --> 29:20.740
So that we can rebel against the Hell Guards.

29:20.910 --> 29:23.620
To let us know how insignificant we really are.

29:24.580 --> 29:28.920
No matter how the Sinners trained, we are no match for the Guards.

29:29.130 --> 29:33.260
Those guys have gone though a lot, 
now they're just hoping to die.

29:33.380 --> 29:36.130
Pretty mush all useless and brain dead.

29:36.760 --> 29:39.600
But even so, we resist.

29:40.140 --> 29:43.640
Our source of energy is our resentments and memories.

29:44.230 --> 29:49.650
That is what reminded us and kept us the way we are.

29:55.360 --> 29:58.320

He's the Hell Guard, the Hell's Will.

He is the one...

30:17.130 --> 30:22.760
He catches the Sinners, inflict pain on 
them, and eat them up completely.

30:24.980 --> 30:27.440
Wouldn't that kill you?

30:27.980 --> 30:31.440
No, it won't, you'd be revived.

30:32.570 --> 30:39.910

revived repeatedly, until his heart is dead.

Be careful, it applies to you too.

30:43.700 --> 30:46.160
Once you're killed, you'd be chained.

42:06.640 --> 42:08.050
Damn!

42:10.930 --> 42:14.350
I'm not going to let you off.

42:16.020 --> 42:18.310
Is it the yellow colored water?

42:18.560 --> 42:21.530
Since it's so effective, we'll have one more round!

42:28.370 --> 42:30.200
Next, you!

42:39.840 --> 42:41.050
It ends here.

42:41.340 --> 42:43.840
It ends for you!

42:47.010 --> 42:49.640
[ Bite of a Broken Baboon's Fang! ]

42:47.010 --> 42:49.640
Higa Zekko!

42:56.890 --> 42:59.860
Don't ever underestimate my Zabimaru.

43:02.940 --> 43:05.110
It's useless, useless!

43:13.450 --> 43:14.700
Very tasty.

43:20.990 --> 43:22.570
Thank you.

43:22.910 --> 43:27.280
It taste kind of funny.

43:27.380 --> 43:30.280
But I don't mind at all.

43:32.090 --> 43:37.420
Stop these needless struggling, just let me kill you.

43:37.720 --> 43:40.850
Save this advice to yourself.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.220
I told you it's useless.

43:43.600 --> 43:44.390
I'm not finished yet.

43:47.860 --> 43:49.950
You better stop when you have the chance.

43:54.200 --> 43:56.450
That must be your "killer shot", right?

43:56.580 --> 43:59.460
I never imagine you could be so stupid.

44:00.750 --> 44:04.130
Try saying it again after you take this.

44:05.090 --> 44:06.300
This is the final attack.

44:06.420 --> 44:08.720
I've said umpteen times it's useless.

44:11.590 --> 44:13.300
What's this?

44:13.890 --> 44:15.430
[Gate Cutter]

44:13.890 --> 44:15.430
Geto Schneider

44:15.560 --> 44:18.430
Using high density Reishi to surround your opponent.

44:18.560 --> 44:20.810
It creates a barrier just like the Sprenger.

44:22.020 --> 44:26.730
But, I should have absorbed all your Reishi.

44:27.320 --> 44:29.110
Why is this here?

44:29.610 --> 44:32.620
It's taken from you.

44:39.620 --> 44:42.710
Through the wounds that Schneider cuts,

44:43.170 --> 44:47.760
The barrier took the Reshi it needed from you.

44:48.460 --> 44:53.800
You're not the only person who specializes in turning 
your opponent's Reishi in your own weapon.

44:55.100 --> 44:56.850
Quincy is so much...

44:59.810 --> 45:00.680
... better at it.

45:23.420 --> 45:24.080
Taikon...

45:25.880 --> 45:26.750
I got you!

45:34.090 --> 45:37.930
Seems like both Taikon and Garogai were defeated.

45:38.350 --> 45:40.270
Though that wasn't part of the plan,

45:40.390 --> 45:43.060
it is still well within our calculations.

45:48.440 --> 45:49.940
Die now.

45:55.780 --> 45:57.910
What a beautiful sound.

46:03.910 --> 46:08.840
Okay... Check the time... On with the next...

46:08.960 --> 46:12.800
[ Third Dance, White Sword. ]

46:08.960 --> 46:12.800
San no mai, Shirafune.

46:32.490 --> 46:33.820
Kuchiki-san!

46:34.650 --> 46:36.450
I'm okay.

46:37.910 --> 46:39.950
You are better than I thought.

46:40.370 --> 46:45.620
I originally plan to drag you down if I'm defeated.

46:46.120 --> 46:47.750
But forget it.

46:48.210 --> 46:52.800
It is inevitable that we die here.

46:52.920 --> 46:55.300
What? What's do you mean?

46:56.260 --> 46:58.800
That, I cannot tell you.

47:03.810 --> 47:06.770
What is he?

47:32.170 --> 47:33.420
Are you okay?

47:36.630 --> 47:37.630
Sorry about that.

47:40.470 --> 47:41.550
Be careful.

47:41.680 --> 47:42.640
Right.

48:02.700 --> 48:04.330
What are these sands.

48:04.790 --> 48:06.830
I can sense some Reiatsu from them.

48:07.200 --> 48:09.500
They are no ordinary sands.

48:11.210 --> 48:14.340
Those sand came from Sinners' bones.

48:14.630 --> 48:15.710
What?

48:16.260 --> 48:20.720
After being continually bombarded by 
Hell's Will, the Sinners lose heart.

48:21.050 --> 48:23.390
Eventually, their body rot away on the ground.

48:23.510 --> 48:26.060
And the Hell Fire burn away the bones.

48:26.560 --> 48:30.020
This desert is the lying ground of the Sinners.

48:30.940 --> 48:34.440
No matter where you are, there's no such thing as freedom.

48:35.480 --> 48:37.030
No freedom?

48:37.400 --> 48:39.900
Didn't you guys come to Karakura Town?

48:41.860 --> 48:44.200
The Hell's Will extends there too.

48:46.830 --> 48:50.790
Save me!

48:53.250 --> 48:55.920
In the end, we still can't escape it...

48:56.420 --> 49:00.670
We don't know how long we are 
going to endure this suffering...

49:00.840 --> 49:02.590
In the end, everybody's broken.

49:05.100 --> 49:09.140
Ichigo, after you've saved your sister,

49:09.270 --> 49:12.020
can you do me a favor?

49:12.850 --> 49:13.940
What is it?

49:15.060 --> 49:18.440
Release me from Hell.

49:19.860 --> 49:21.860
I want to be reborn.

49:22.320 --> 49:24.990
I want to see my sister again.

49:25.490 --> 49:27.790
I want to apologize to her.

49:31.620 --> 49:35.420
Alright, if it is within my ability.

49:35.840 --> 49:37.090
Sorry about that.

49:38.590 --> 49:40.970
Ichigo, let's hurry.

49:41.220 --> 49:42.340
It's just beyond that hill.

50:14.460 --> 50:15.500
Yuzu...

50:18.290 --> 50:20.550
Yuzu!

50:46.280 --> 50:48.820
Thank you for coming, Kurosaki Ichigo.

50:49.330 --> 50:50.790
Give Yuzu back.

50:51.700 --> 50:53.870
My name is Shuren.

50:55.160 --> 50:56.750
You know...

50:57.210 --> 50:59.710
If you want to save your sister,

50:59.920 --> 51:02.840
you'll have to listen to me.

51:10.970 --> 51:14.560
Are you going to fight the two of us singlehandedly?

51:15.600 --> 51:17.060
Not singlehandedly.

51:18.810 --> 51:21.360
Sinners don't die in Hell.

51:21.480 --> 51:25.280
Kokuto, you should know that.

51:26.400 --> 51:27.240
You did not...

51:28.200 --> 51:30.700
Taikon, Gunjo, Garogai.

51:47.130 --> 51:51.010
They fight to separate you with your friends.

51:51.100 --> 51:53.600
They die so that they can return here.

51:54.140 --> 51:55.430
Impossible!

51:55.990 --> 51:58.420
You can't be revived that fast...

51:58.520 --> 52:02.050
What you know may not always be how it is.

52:05.130 --> 52:05.930
Kokuto!

52:06.400 --> 52:07.700
Go save you sister!

52:07.700 --> 52:09.700
Leave me to it!

52:12.410 --> 52:15.790
Sinner making friends with a human?

52:20.920 --> 52:23.250
Kokuto!

52:24.300 --> 52:26.670
I'd be you opponent.

52:40.270 --> 52:42.610
It's about time you submit to me!

52:42.730 --> 52:44.110
Shut up!

53:33.360 --> 53:33.990
What?

53:36.410 --> 53:37.080
Yuzu!

53:55.430 --> 53:58.350
You can't win now!

53:59.470 --> 54:02.270
Shut up, it's the same for you!

54:08.900 --> 54:09.980
He's not...

54:15.280 --> 54:16.200
What...

54:16.370 --> 54:17.740
It's over!

54:21.580 --> 54:24.830
Kokuto!

54:31.710 --> 54:33.760
Damn it!

54:37.930 --> 54:42.350
Where are you looking at, your opponent is over here.

54:48.020 --> 54:52.440
I don't have the time to keep playing with you!

54:52.820 --> 54:55.400
[ Moon Fang Heaven-Piercer! ]

54:52.820 --> 54:55.400
Getsuga Tensho!

55:08.750 --> 55:12.090
That's wonderful, that's the power...

55:12.170 --> 55:15.760
That's the power I need to destroy the Hell's Gate.

55:16.010 --> 55:18.430
Shut the hell up!

55:20.300 --> 55:22.470
Good call.

55:22.770 --> 55:29.310
You are still rational enough to realize what 
it might lead to, had you attacked.

55:34.490 --> 55:36.820
I won't kill you.

55:48.670 --> 55:50.170
Splendid!

55:50.840 --> 55:53.300
Come... destroy the gate!

56:46.680 --> 56:49.550
Yuzu, I'm coming now.

57:20.410 --> 57:22.780
How are you, Ichigo?

57:31.120 --> 57:35.290
Quiet, it's just a small cut.

57:43.740 --> 57:45.260
Why...

57:46.740 --> 57:48.470
Why what?

57:49.540 --> 57:52.100
I did this for the same reason they did.

57:52.340 --> 57:56.640
Didn't I say that in here, you'd be revived after you die.

58:09.230 --> 58:13.630
What a nuisance, why won't you 
remain dead for a couple of minutes.

58:15.970 --> 58:17.230
You betrayed us?

58:17.340 --> 58:18.100
Who?

58:19.070 --> 58:21.770
Everything is according to plan.

58:21.870 --> 58:25.640
All of you are just helping me.

58:25.910 --> 58:31.110
Come on, hollowfied and help 
me. Didn't you promise me?

58:32.150 --> 58:35.020
What about those things about your sister?

58:35.220 --> 58:37.480
Those are real.

58:38.420 --> 58:39.980
My sister was kill.

58:40.590 --> 58:44.460
And I literally beat the life out of the murderer.

58:46.370 --> 58:47.960
Shut the hell up!

58:49.870 --> 58:52.860
I was feeling great for a second.

58:52.970 --> 58:56.170
My sister is not going to come back to life.

58:56.340 --> 59:00.840
No matter how much I think about her.

59:01.280 --> 59:07.740
So I want everyone to have a taste of my pain.

59:09.990 --> 59:15.850
Why am I banished to Hell? Why?!

59:17.760 --> 59:20.730
I tried to escape many times.

59:20.830 --> 59:25.030
Each time, the Hell's Will pulverizes 
me and send me back to Hell.

59:26.000 --> 59:28.030
Then I saw it there...

59:28.140 --> 59:31.300
This memory in the rubbish dump.

59:31.410 --> 59:34.310
That's right, it's you fully hollowfied.

59:34.880 --> 59:39.180
So I spread this information to those guys in Hell.

59:39.920 --> 59:43.410
I have to get out of here at all cost.

59:43.520 --> 59:47.720
I don't care even if the Human 
World gets engulfed into Hell.

59:52.030 --> 59:53.050
Ichigo!

59:53.900 --> 59:54.960
How are you?

59:57.140 --> 59:59.190
You're indeed one of

59:59.880 --> 01:00:01.500
No...

01:00:05.090 --> 01:00:07.680
You can't cut the chain with that...

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.140
Ishida! Rukia!

01:00:15.270 --> 01:00:16.390
Rukia!

01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:21.020
What?

01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:37.620
That's the way to go, release all your hatred.

01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:41.420
Let out all your anger and cut this chain.

01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:47.880
That's not enough.

01:00:48.050 --> 01:00:50.970
If you don't transform into the 
monster, you'll never beat me.

01:00:57.100 --> 01:00:58.690
Look up here!

01:01:00.600 --> 01:01:05.730
Your sister can no longer withstand the Hell's miasma.

01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.280
Look, the chain is growing out of her.

01:01:13.700 --> 01:01:15.660
Yes, let your anger out.

01:01:15.990 --> 01:01:18.580
This is Hell, you don't have to hold back.

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:20.920
Let the darkness take over!

01:01:22.290 --> 01:01:24.500
Ichigo...

01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:31.090
Welcome to Hell.

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:48.610
That's it!

01:01:48.690 --> 01:01:50.860
Use that power to break the chain!

01:02:10.090 --> 01:02:12.510
Free me!

01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:33.570
Shuren thought that they would be free 
from Hell once the gate is destroyed.

01:02:33.570 --> 01:02:34.990
But he is wrong.

01:02:34.990 --> 01:02:38.700
The chain is what's restraining the Sinners.

01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:41.580
Come on, just a little bit more.

01:02:41.910 --> 01:02:44.870
Cut off all the chains that been binding me.

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:26.960
Alright, this is the last chain.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.470
Don't let him provoke you!

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:47.600
Ichigo, return to the Human World!

01:03:56.650 --> 01:03:57.320
What?

01:03:57.610 --> 01:04:00.660
Serve you right.

01:04:08.330 --> 01:04:13.510
No!!!

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:31.690
Our Kido team has prevented the miasma escaping 
from the Hell's Gate from spreading further.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:35.150
How's Karakura Town?

01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:37.110
There isn't any abnormalities at the moment.

01:04:37.200 --> 01:04:40.200
Okay.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:44.160
Continue with the repairs. You'd be in charge.

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:44.540
Yes sir.

01:05:04.930 --> 01:05:06.270
I've a report, sir!

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.640
Shinigami Proxy, Kurosaki Ichigo has been found at the Hell's Gate.

01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:12.690
Our men are already watching over him.

01:05:30.710 --> 01:05:34.090
You guys... go away.

01:05:34.290 --> 01:05:38.630
Yuzu, I've to get her out of here!

01:05:38.970 --> 01:05:43.220
Calm down, we have already 
informed the medical team.

01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:45.180
I can't afford to wait!

01:05:45.290 --> 01:05:46.490
Hold him down.

01:05:46.590 --> 01:05:47.860
Don't touch me!

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:49.920
You guys!

01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:53.130
Yuzu... Yuzu can't be like this...

01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:55.130
Kurosaki Ichigo.

01:06:00.600 --> 01:06:01.730
Old Master...

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:06.860
Excuse me.

01:06:06.860 --> 01:06:08.240
Kurosaki-kun!

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:10.320
Inoue! Yuzu is...

01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:12.450
You have to save Yuzu.

01:06:12.530 --> 01:06:13.700
I know.

01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:16.330
Hang in there, Yuzu-chan!

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:19.750
Yuzu!

01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:26.630
What is this?

01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:31.090
Yuzu!

01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:32.430
Why...

01:06:45.730 --> 01:06:48.530
Inoue, Inoue!

01:06:49.070 --> 01:06:50.530
What's wrong?!

01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:52.240
I beg you, I beg

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:53.700
It's no use.

01:06:55.740 --> 01:07:00.000
That girl's attached to the Hell's chain...

01:07:00.080 --> 01:07:02.870
She's one of them now.

01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:05.420
There's nothing we can do to help her.

01:07:06.540 --> 01:07:09.130
No, that's not true.

01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:12.590
It all started because of you.

01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:31.190
Yuzu!

01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:56.010
You made the wrong decision and charged into Hell.

01:07:56.090 --> 01:07:59.350
That's why we are in such a bad situation.

01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:06.400
That demon in you...

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:11.320
broke the chains that has been 
invulnerable for centuries.

01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:20.290
Which means, you're going to turn this world into Hell.

01:08:21.370 --> 01:08:29.710
Your irresponsible action put all the Humans in danger.

01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:41.640
Pardon me...

01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:47.479
Byakuya...

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:55.359
Kurosaki Ichigo, why are you avoiding my eyes?

01:08:57.160 --> 01:09:02.910
I left Rukia, Renji, and Ishida there.

01:09:03.750 --> 01:09:05.830
I left everyone there.

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:10.630
And Yuzu... I've let everyone down...

01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:14.670
So what?

01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:17.220
Byakuya?

01:09:19.090 --> 01:09:23.310
Rukia, your sister, is in Hell!

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.479
They did everything to get me out...

01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:32.859
Rukia is a honorable Shinigami, she knows what she is doing.

01:09:35.399 --> 01:09:38.359
If they decided that you should be the one to escape...

01:09:38.450 --> 01:09:40.450
You better start thinking about their intentions.

01:09:43.330 --> 01:09:44.830
Sorry to intrude...

01:09:51.330 --> 01:09:52.460
Yuzu?!

01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:55.130
Yuzu!

01:09:57.010 --> 01:09:58.220
Yuzu!

01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:07.520
Yuzu, hey Yuzu!

01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.810
Something happen?

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:13.400
Come in.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:14.520
Yes.

01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:50.190
If they decided that you should be the one to escape...

01:10:50.310 --> 01:10:52.400
You better start thinking about their intentions.

01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:59.610
Inoue, how's Yuzu?

01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:02.990
She's better now.

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:06.530
Thank you.

01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:09.870
No, everyone helped.

01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:13.500
Sado, how's Sado doing?

01:11:13.630 --> 01:11:20.220
He's still unconscious, but he will do just fine.

01:11:20.550 --> 01:11:21.720
I see.

01:11:23.550 --> 01:11:25.550
Thank you, really.

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:29.220
You must be tired, you want something to drink?

01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:31.810
Kurosaki-kun?

01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:38.530
Are you going there again?

01:11:39.730 --> 01:11:43.860
Yuzu was taken by Hell, but she is alive again.

01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:47.030
There's still hope for Rukia, and everyone.

01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.540
But, you'll...

01:11:49.660 --> 01:11:50.330
I know.

01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:53.500
If I lose control the second time,

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:56.540
the world might really come to an end...

01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:59.170
just as the Old Master said.

01:12:00.050 --> 01:12:04.220
But this time, I won't lose control.

01:12:04.680 --> 01:12:06.090
That guy is strong...

01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:08.930
None of us can beat him.

01:12:08.930 --> 01:12:12.640
I'm not sure I can beat him not hollowfied.

01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:14.690
But I must win this battle.

01:12:15.730 --> 01:12:20.860
Or I will never be able to face my friends 
who entrusted their lives to me.

01:12:27.240 --> 01:12:32.290
You must...  come back.

01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:36.460
It won't be long.

01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:51.190
I've a report.

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:55.730
The Shinigami Proxy has broken out of the barrier.

01:12:55.810 --> 01:12:57.810
He's coming here this very moment.

01:12:57.900 --> 01:12:58.900
Ichigo?

01:12:59.020 --> 01:13:01.650
That asshole... Ukitake?

01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.690
Repairing the Hell's Gate is our top priority right now.

01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:06.740
I understand. I'll handle Kurosaki

01:13:12.790 --> 01:13:14.910
What do you think you're doing, Kurosaki?

01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:18.830
Looking for revenge?

01:13:21.710 --> 01:13:24.920
If that's the case, all the more 
reason we should stop you.

01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:28.010
If you lose control again, this time...

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:29.930
Bankai!

01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:36.100
I'm going back to save my friends.

01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:37.940
Kurosaki!

01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.280
What's going on this time?

01:13:53.200 --> 01:13:56.410
Everyone, on the defense. Don't let the 
Hell's Will into the Human World.

01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.460
Ichigo!

01:13:58.540 --> 01:13:59.500
Let him go.

01:13:59.830 --> 01:14:02.960
We have no time for him right now.

01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:01.600
He came?

01:15:10.570 --> 01:15:14.950
Ichigo, I was just about to pay you a visit you.

01:15:15.080 --> 01:15:18.290
Wasn't expecting you to come here.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.160
Are you here to revenge your sister?

01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:22.960
Yuzu is safe.

01:15:24.170 --> 01:15:25.710
That was a surprise.

01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:28.300
Why are you here then?

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:33.720
I came for my friends.

01:15:34.180 --> 01:15:35.760
You friends?

01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:40.020
You don't seem to know this place.

01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:44.150
They've all been bounded to the Hell's chain. Look.

01:15:47.190 --> 01:15:48.610
Ishida! Renji!

01:15:49.150 --> 01:15:52.030
The guys are not yet taken.

01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:59.040
But no rush, the petite Shinigami woman is ready.

01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:09.420
Rukia!

01:16:20.470 --> 01:16:22.350
Ichigo, why are

01:16:23.730 --> 01:16:26.940
The rule is simple in Hell.

01:16:27.020 --> 01:16:30.320
Those that are bounded to the chains 
can be revived countlessly.

01:16:30.730 --> 01:16:35.820
If you don't break the chain, you'll never 
be able to get out of this place.

01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:39.700
I'll break the chains then.

01:16:40.290 --> 01:16:42.450
How dependable...

01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:45.250
You'll break my chains too, right?

01:16:47.250 --> 01:16:48.840
That won't do.

01:16:50.630 --> 01:16:52.590
I want to defeat you.

01:17:15.820 --> 01:17:20.200
What an idiot. You think you can 
defeat me without the mask?

01:17:26.500 --> 01:17:28.080
You're too naive.

01:17:28.170 --> 01:17:33.260
No matter how resolute you are, 
you can never beat me like this.

01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:43.890
[ Moon Fang Heaven-Piercer! ]

01:17:40.890 --> 01:17:43.890
Getsuga Tensho!

01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:49.560
That's right...

01:18:06.710 --> 01:18:07.750
Ichigo...

01:18:19.470 --> 01:18:20.800
What's the matter?

01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:23.930
What are you afraid of?

01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:32.150
The other you that will destroy the world?

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:37.820
Then don't ever come here again.

01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:42.910
You sister is saved

01:18:43.030 --> 01:18:46.500
because you turn into that monster, right?

01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:49.460
Without that, you can do nothing.

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.100
Didn't I say...

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:13.100
In a world that is void of hopes, resentments 
and memories are what kept a person sane.

01:19:14.150 --> 01:19:17.480
Revenge is what drives me.

01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:20.900
What's wrong now?

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:42.050
Hate me more!

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:46.140
That will make you even more powerful.

01:20:14.250 --> 01:20:19.210
Do you want me to get your sisters here again?

01:20:35.150 --> 01:20:37.810
Yes, that how I want it.

01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:43.360
Once the body is broken, it's easy for a relapse.

01:20:43.570 --> 01:20:51.950
Since you can't escape from the 
monster, you might as well relent.

01:20:57.670 --> 01:20:58.710
Ichigo...

01:20:59.670 --> 01:21:01.170
Ichigo!

01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:05.590
Keep quiet, the show is just about to begin.

01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.640
Hear that, Ichigo?

01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:21.400
The Hell's Will has detected the change in your Reiatsu.

01:21:27.320 --> 01:21:31.620
They'll be here in no time to devour 
the person who might destroy Hell.

01:21:37.170 --> 01:21:39.920
Hurry up and complete your transformation, Ichigo!

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:42.380
Or you'd be eaten by them

01:21:42.460 --> 01:21:46.090
But fret not, you'd be revived again!

01:21:46.630 --> 01:21:51.810
If you don't destroy Hell, you'll 
just have to keep reliving this!

01:22:01.570 --> 01:22:03.650
So what is it going to be?

01:22:04.150 --> 01:22:06.860
Who would... want to be a monster.

01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:10.120
Who would want to be a monster.

01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:14.450
Because you can't get what you want...

01:22:15.500 --> 01:22:18.620
You wanted revenge?

01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:27.760
You're just making other people as miserable as you.

01:22:33.680 --> 01:22:37.640
Revenge is just the path you took to escape your sufferings.

01:22:43.480 --> 01:22:46.280
I wanted to save my friends...

01:22:47.190 --> 01:22:52.530
But I won't sacrifice innocent bystanders to do it.

01:22:55.490 --> 01:22:58.580
Ichigo, run. Ichigo!

01:23:00.170 --> 01:23:04.630
I've swore on my life that...

01:23:05.340 --> 01:23:06.920
I will fight!

01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.430
Ichigo!

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.850
Ichigo!

01:23:35.830 --> 01:23:39.830
That's great. Kill them all!

01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:49.170
What is this?

01:24:25.670 --> 01:24:28.250
What is going on?

01:24:31.670 --> 01:24:33.680
What did you do?

01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:41.390
Kokuto, did your sister want you to avenge her?

01:24:42.270 --> 01:24:43.640
What are you getting at?

01:24:44.190 --> 01:24:48.650
Do you think she wish to see you 
in your endless killing spree?

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:52.110
There would be no end to revenge.

01:24:53.450 --> 01:24:58.910
You would just make your sister miserable forever.

01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:07.000
My friends do not want me to avenge 
them, they want me to stop you.

01:25:08.250 --> 01:25:12.260
You see this... Hell agrees with me.

01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:18.100
Hell would rather help an outsider 
like me, than to let you escape.

01:25:19.140 --> 01:25:22.390
Hell helping a human...

01:25:23.230 --> 01:25:26.600
No, how's that even possible!

01:25:27.270 --> 01:25:30.270
My predicament was just like yours!

01:25:35.490 --> 01:25:36.660
Yes...

01:25:37.030 --> 01:25:39.530
We are both human...

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:43.000
And we are both elder brothers.

01:26:23.370 --> 01:26:24.580
Chains?

01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:29.080
I'm free.

01:26:29.170 --> 01:26:35.210
I'm finally free.

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:47.600
Why's this?!

01:26:49.850 --> 01:26:52.770
Stop this! I...

01:26:59.530 --> 01:27:03.780
This is your retribution for deceiving Hell.

01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:09.160
Kokuto, atone for you sins in Hell!

01:27:44.370 --> 01:27:45.530
I did it...

01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:48.120
I did it...

01:27:49.450 --> 01:27:53.380
Yeah!

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.620
Ichigo

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:56.090
Good work.

01:27:56.920 --> 01:27:59.460
Now it's just finding Ishida and Renji.

01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:06.010
Oh yeah, I just broke their chains. Where are they?

01:28:06.220 --> 01:28:07.390
Over here.

01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:11.100
I'm aching all over.

01:28:11.190 --> 01:28:14.650
Me too, I'm stiff as a rock.

01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:18.320
You guys were bounded to the chains too. Deal with it!

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:21.610
Bounded to the chains? What chains?

01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:26.160
Seems like it's all over.

01:28:26.370 --> 01:28:27.830
What happen to that guy?

01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:31.080
He was dragged into the dept of Hell.

01:28:31.210 --> 01:28:34.170
The important thing is we

01:28:34.290 --> 01:28:36.750
What is that?!

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.630
This?

01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:43.090
I'm not sure.

01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:46.970
I think it's some power they lend me. Strange right?

01:28:47.050 --> 01:28:49.680
It's more than just strange.

01:28:49.810 --> 01:28:51.100
We're taking about controlling the Hell's power.

01:28:51.230 --> 01:28:52.680
You're hopeless.

01:28:52.770 --> 01:28:54.940
That's why people are always taking advantage of you.

01:28:55.060 --> 01:28:56.810
Quick, change back to your normal form.

01:28:57.530 --> 01:29:00.240
Okay, I'll deactivate it right away.

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:05.660
Wait, Ichigo. Once you deactivate it, 
they will start attacking us again...

01:29:09.340 --> 01:29:10.380
See?

01:33:23.010 --> 01:33:24.090
Yuzu?

01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:26.760
Karin-chan, morning

01:33:35.140 --> 01:33:36.310
What's going on?

01:33:36.430 --> 01:33:37.890
I'm so glad!

01:33:38.010 --> 01:33:39.930
What's this...

01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:41.970

01:33:50.305 --> 01:33:56.225
