00:02.560 --> 00:06.164
This programme contains
some violent scenes.

00:06.199 --> 00:11.520
'Torchwood
- tracking down alien life on earth, arming the human race against the future.

00:11.555 --> 00:15.964
'The 21st century is when everything
changes and you've got to be ready. '

00:15.999 --> 00:21.079
Suzie Costelloe. Why did you kill those people?
The more I used the glove, the more I control it.

00:21.114 --> 00:24.079
If I could get it to work all
the time, it could resurrect...

00:25.160 --> 00:27.080
I loved this job. I really loved it.

01:02.599 --> 01:04.364
At last. You must be Torchwood?

01:04.399 --> 01:06.644
My team bitch about
you all the time.

01:06.679 --> 01:10.685
And you are? Detective Swanson.
I'm Captain Jack Harkness.

01:10.720 --> 01:14.400
So I've heard. Are you always this
dressy for a murder investigation?

01:14.435 --> 01:16.645
What, d'you rather me naked?

01:16.680 --> 01:19.244
God help me, the stories are true.

01:19.279 --> 01:22.844
So who's the victim?
That's victims, plural.

01:22.879 --> 01:27.319
Yesterday, a man was murdered at
96 Oakham Street, Alex Arwyn, 28,

01:27.354 --> 01:31.836
single, estate agent, here we go,
that's from the scene of crime.

01:31.871 --> 01:36.319
Today, in here, we get two more,
Mark and Sarah Brisco, both 33,

01:36.354 --> 01:38.957
married, he's a surveyor,
she works in education.

01:38.992 --> 01:41.525
What about the smears of blood?
Is that writing?

01:41.560 --> 01:45.359
Work in progress. Come inside
and see the finished thing.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.920
Oh, my God...

02:00.280 --> 02:02.520
Looks like somebody
wants your attention.

02:06.240 --> 02:07.680
They've got it.

02:17.160 --> 02:22.280
We found a few of the killer's hairs from the
first murder. Lab results should be in soon.

02:22.315 --> 02:23.965
Good, we'll need that.

02:24.000 --> 02:29.880
Now, if you could just clear the room? Some
of this equipment is strictly need to know.

02:32.599 --> 02:34.560
It was only a matter of time.

02:34.595 --> 02:36.239
What was?

02:37.959 --> 02:41.699
Torchwood walks all over
this city, like you own it.

02:41.734 --> 02:45.126
Now these people are paying
the price - ordinary people,

02:45.161 --> 02:48.484
ripped apart, with your name
written in their own blood.

02:48.519 --> 02:54.119
From where I'm standing, you did
this, Captain Jack Harkness.

02:54.154 --> 02:55.759
You did it.

03:02.919 --> 03:05.045
Still, at least
we've got a head start.

03:05.080 --> 03:08.679
If it's someone we've pissed off,
that narrows it down to...

03:08.714 --> 03:11.296
ooh, four or five million.

03:11.331 --> 03:13.879
And that's just the humans.

03:13.914 --> 03:16.244
Tosh, how we doing?

03:16.279 --> 03:19.765
There's no record of Mr and
Mrs Brisco on our database.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.280
Nor yesterday's victim, and no
link between him and the Briscos.

03:23.315 --> 03:25.445
No connection between any of them.

03:25.480 --> 03:30.640
Jack? They've got the results
on the killer's hair.

03:34.039 --> 03:40.039
Initial findings say, Caucasian male,
early 40s, smoker, drinks tequila.

03:40.074 --> 03:43.244
Doesn't match any DNA profiles.

03:43.279 --> 03:48.439
Only thing of interest is a compound
we've never seen before. Recognise it?

03:50.239 --> 03:52.640
Oh, we're in trouble. What is it?

03:52.675 --> 03:54.245
Compound B67.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.445
You're kidding? Retcon.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.080
He's got Retcon in his blood.

04:09.999 --> 04:15.800
B67, aka Retcon, aka the magic
ingredient of the amnesia pill.

04:15.835 --> 04:17.565
And this belongs to us?

04:17.600 --> 04:20.760
This killer is somebody
we gave the amnesia pill to?

04:20.795 --> 04:23.164
Is he remembering
that he's a serial killer?

04:23.199 --> 04:26.440
Or is he becoming a serial killer
because of the Retcon?

04:26.475 --> 04:29.164
Wait a minute. I've taken Retcon.

04:29.199 --> 04:32.204
Then better stay away
from sharp objects.

04:32.239 --> 04:35.520
lanto, how many people have
we given amnesia pills to?

04:35.555 --> 04:39.799
2,008. Hey, what if they
all become psychotic?!

04:39.834 --> 04:42.257
D'you have to sound so happy?

04:42.292 --> 04:44.645
I'm just saying. Mean Streets!

04:44.680 --> 04:49.004
Tosh, narrow the list down to fit
Swanson's profile, start checking them out.

04:49.039 --> 04:53.959
You two, there's got to be a link between the
victims, find the link, find the killer. Get to it!

04:53.994 --> 04:58.444
Jack? If there is a link, why don't
we just ask the victims ourselves?

04:58.479 --> 05:04.320
Not the right time for a seance, thank you very much.
The first time I met Torchwood, you had that glove.

05:05.920 --> 05:08.444
Heh-heh, no way!
Not after what it did to Suzie.

05:08.479 --> 05:12.239
It brings people back to life. We
could question the murder victims.

05:12.274 --> 05:13.964
That's exactly what she said.

05:13.999 --> 05:17.679
She was one of us, we trusted her
and she's dead cos of that thing.

05:17.714 --> 05:20.677
The glove stays in
the safe where it belongs.

05:20.712 --> 05:23.640
These murders are happening
because of Torchwood.

05:23.675 --> 05:27.919
So Torchwood has got to
do something.

05:32.840 --> 05:35.564
It fell through the Rift
about 40 years ago.

05:35.599 --> 05:39.439
Lay at the bottom of the Bay
till we dredged it up.

05:39.474 --> 05:41.605
I always figured,

05:41.640 --> 05:44.879
this wasn't just lost.
Whoever made it,

05:44.914 --> 05:46.564
wanted rid of it.

05:46.599 --> 05:49.445
You know, we never
gave it a cool name.

05:49.480 --> 05:52.440
I thought we called it
the resurrection gauntlet?

05:52.475 --> 05:54.885
COOL name.

05:54.920 --> 05:59.040
What about the Risen Mitten?

06:02.200 --> 06:03.960
I think it's catchy.

06:08.879 --> 06:09.960
Jack? You OK?

06:17.440 --> 06:20.640
Don't forget, the maximum
resurrection time is two minutes,

06:20.675 --> 06:22.805
and that was only cos Suzie
had practice.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.840
The most we're likely to get
is 30 seconds. Tosh, ready?

06:25.875 --> 06:27.645
Ready.

06:27.680 --> 06:29.405
And, recording.

06:29.440 --> 06:35.040
This man was victim number one.
Name - Alex Arwyn.

06:41.959 --> 06:45.039
Come on, Alex. Come back.

06:45.074 --> 06:46.124
How does it work?

06:46.159 --> 06:50.760
You just sort of feel.
Like reaching into the dark.

06:50.795 --> 06:53.217
Finding the dead.

06:53.252 --> 06:55.639
I can't... I don't...

06:55.674 --> 06:57.079
Ah.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.599
Damn! Ah!

06:59.634 --> 07:00.999
Ah! Nothing!

07:03.040 --> 07:04.205
Sorry.

07:04.240 --> 07:06.479
Never was very good
with this thing. Owen?

07:06.514 --> 07:08.164
I tried last time.

07:08.199 --> 07:11.800
We all had a go, it only responded
to Suzie. Well, I never had a go.

07:23.320 --> 07:24.640
It's cold.

07:25.759 --> 07:27.724
It warms up.

07:27.759 --> 07:33.520
The glove relies on some sort of
empathy. Maybe compassion and...

07:33.555 --> 07:35.479
Just be yourself.

07:35.514 --> 07:37.999
BEEPING

07:40.559 --> 07:42.959
SHE GASPS

07:43.959 --> 07:45.365
Somebody help me!

07:45.400 --> 07:49.519
Oh, my God, help me,
help me, help me! Alex!

07:49.554 --> 07:51.657
I need you to listen to me.

07:51.692 --> 07:53.725
Somebody help! HELP ME!

07:53.760 --> 07:57.880
Alex, you were attacked. Do you
know who it was? Who attacked you!?

07:57.915 --> 07:59.244
Who are you? How long?

07:59.279 --> 08:00.884
- Where am I?
- 15 seconds.

08:00.919 --> 08:03.799
Who are you? I'm trying
to help, sweetheart.

08:03.834 --> 08:04.800
I want my mum.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.605
Please! Let me see my mum...

08:11.795 --> 08:14.845
He's gone. Let me keep trying.
Gwen, he's dead.

08:14.880 --> 08:19.480
I can bring him back. The glove only works
once. I can do it, let me try. Gwen. Look at me.

08:19.515 --> 08:21.000
He's gone.

08:24.960 --> 08:28.645
That was amazing,
she's a natural. 24 seconds!

08:28.680 --> 08:33.639
Give lanto a stopwatch, and he's
happy. It's the button on the top.

08:33.674 --> 08:36.600
What d'you think, Gwen?
D'you want to stop?

08:39.559 --> 08:41.445
Recording.

08:41.480 --> 08:44.680
Victim number two - Mark Brisco.

08:45.999 --> 08:51.840
Oh God, I can feel him, it's like a
rope from my heart to the glove...

08:51.875 --> 08:53.359
Oh, it's so warm.

08:58.639 --> 09:03.119
Hey, there. Just look at me.
Look me in the eye. That's it.

09:04.759 --> 09:10.039
You've been hurt, we don't have long,
we need to know who attacked you.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.759
We're looking after her.

09:13.794 --> 09:15.759
Now Mark, who was it?

09:22.680 --> 09:24.200
What's Pilgrim?

09:28.600 --> 09:33.400
No, Mark, he's gone, we don't have long,
quickly, what was his name? 35 seconds.

09:35.720 --> 09:39.084
Never knew his surname.

09:39.119 --> 09:44.084
Trying Pilgrim and Max,
get a description.

09:44.119 --> 09:47.720
You gotta give us something more
so we can catch him. He's going.

09:47.755 --> 09:51.005
There was...

09:51.040 --> 09:55.400
There was someone who knew
him better... That woman...

09:55.919 --> 10:00.840
She was always talking to him...
What was her name? Where's my wife?

10:00.875 --> 10:03.919
Her name! Suzie.

10:06.720 --> 10:10.440

10:11.720 --> 10:13.720
One minute five seconds.

10:13.755 --> 10:15.720
Jack? Did I hear that right?

10:15.755 --> 10:16.000
Could be anyone,

10:16.120 --> 10:17.725
Could be anyone,

10:17.760 --> 10:19.960
there must be lots of women called
Suzie. Not connected to this case.

10:20.119 --> 10:21.999
there must be lots of women called
Suzie. Not connected to this case.

10:24.200 --> 10:26.600
We've been talking
to the wrong corpse.

10:37.280 --> 10:43.740
Pilgrim. A religious support group, more like a
debating society, meaning of life, does God exist?

10:43.775 --> 10:50.200
All that stuff. The point is, it was tiny, more
like a hobby, run by Mark Brisco's wife, Sarah.

10:50.235 --> 10:52.724
She had all that
stashed in the wardrobe.

10:52.759 --> 10:57.839
Handwritten and photocopied, that's why we
couldn't find any records, she wasn't even online.

10:57.874 --> 11:00.719
No mention of Suzie, or Max?
Not a word.

11:00.754 --> 11:02.777
She didn't even keep a register.

11:02.812 --> 11:04.765
It wouldn't be our Suzie, though.

11:04.800 --> 11:08.679
She wouldn't go to that support
group bollocks. How do you know?

11:08.714 --> 11:11.617
I mean, were you friends?
Any of you?

11:11.652 --> 11:14.546
Who was her best friend
in this place?

11:14.581 --> 11:17.440
She sort of kept herself to herself.

11:17.475 --> 11:18.965
Well, then.

11:19.000 --> 11:24.879
If she needed to talk, maybe that's exactly
where she'd go, a group of complete strangers.

11:24.914 --> 11:28.485
Could be. You've got a point, Gwen.

11:28.520 --> 11:31.800
Time we got to know our deceased
colleague a little better.

11:42.479 --> 11:44.005
Have I got this right?

11:44.040 --> 11:47.339
When I die,
you get to keep all my possessions?

11:47.374 --> 11:50.639
My whole life's gonna
get stashed in a locker?

11:50.674 --> 11:52.200
Rules and regulations.

11:53.799 --> 11:56.760
What if I leave all
my stuff to Rhys?

11:56.795 --> 11:58.840
We'll stash him away, too.

12:00.640 --> 12:03.179
Tread carefully, people.
With respect.

12:03.214 --> 12:05.719
This is the life of Suzie Costello.

12:17.119 --> 12:18.880
That's all we are, in the end.

12:18.915 --> 12:21.079
A pile of boxes.

12:30.400 --> 12:33.800
Is her father still alive?
Don't know.

12:33.835 --> 12:35.517
But you must've looked him up?

12:35.552 --> 12:37.164
To tell him his daughter was dead?

12:37.199 --> 12:39.919
When Suzie left Torchwood,
she was on the run.

12:39.954 --> 12:42.085
She wiped all her records.

12:42.120 --> 12:45.480
I couldn't retrieve her files,
she was good at computers.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.359
Huh... She was good at everything.

12:47.394 --> 12:49.636
She was good at murder too.

12:49.671 --> 12:51.879
Laugh a minute, that was Suzie.

12:53.199 --> 12:54.679
What's that?

12:54.714 --> 12:56.965
A book.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.440
Emily Dickinson.

12:59.475 --> 13:01.277
Poet.

13:01.312 --> 13:03.079
Jack.

13:05.319 --> 13:07.325
Pilgrim.

13:07.360 --> 13:09.804
She's part of it.

13:09.839 --> 13:11.800
That proves it, then. No choice.

13:13.600 --> 13:15.799
It's time Suzie came back.

13:51.280 --> 13:54.920
Do we all get frozen? Torchwood
staff, when we die, do we all get kept?

13:54.955 --> 13:57.280
Rules and regulations.
How long for?

13:57.315 --> 14:00.004
Forever. Recording.

14:00.039 --> 14:04.239
Have you got your stopwatch? Always.
I'll record from my station.

14:04.274 --> 14:07.519
I'm sorry, but I don't want to look
her in the eye. Sorry.

14:11.800 --> 14:13.519
Anyone else?

14:15.879 --> 14:17.725
Any advice?

14:17.760 --> 14:22.120
Yeah, I know. Empathy. Even though she
did try to kill me. You and me both.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.039
SHE GASPS

14:32.520 --> 14:34.080
I'm getting a reading.

14:38.280 --> 14:40.519
No, it's gone...

14:43.719 --> 14:45.859
SHE BREATHES HEAVILY

14:45.894 --> 14:47.965
Just... memories.

14:48.000 --> 14:50.679
Nothing living. She's too far gone.

14:50.714 --> 14:53.359
What do we do now? Nothing we can do.

14:53.394 --> 14:54.885
That's it.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.845
We're out of options.
There's always the knife.

14:57.880 --> 15:03.840
When she killed all those people, she always used the
knife, it's made out of the same metal as the glove.

15:03.875 --> 15:07.085
We've seen it before,
metallic resonance.

15:07.120 --> 15:11.599
The glove works better if the knife's part
of the process, like closing a circuit.

15:11.634 --> 15:15.559
Then let's use it. Small detail.
The knife was used to kill people.

15:15.594 --> 15:17.999
She's already dead.
So we kill her again.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.080
lanto?

15:30.360 --> 15:32.040
Life knife.

15:36.879 --> 15:37.879
Anything?

15:39.160 --> 15:42.920
No, there was just a sort of
spark and then it was gone.

15:42.955 --> 15:46.039
I'm sorry, Jack.
You're gonna have do it properly.

15:48.079 --> 15:49.519
What the hell.

15:53.039 --> 15:54.759
SUZIE AND GWEN GASP

15:54.794 --> 15:56.444
Suzie? I've gotta go!

15:56.479 --> 15:59.759
I can't stay, they know.
Just look at where you are.

15:59.794 --> 16:03.040
Think back, try to remember...
Suzie! Suzie! Look at me!

16:03.075 --> 16:06.977
Jack. Oh, my God.
There's a knife in my chest,

16:07.012 --> 16:10.844
did you kill me?
You killed yourself, remember?

16:10.879 --> 16:15.759
But... Oh my God, I shot myself.
We've got to ask you about Pilgrim.

16:15.794 --> 16:17.804
No. Wait a minute.
Didn't I kill you?

16:17.839 --> 16:20.320
Never mind that,
we need names and details.

16:20.355 --> 16:22.045
Who's using the glove? I'm sorry.

16:22.080 --> 16:25.124
Oh, wouldn't you know it,
Gwen bloody Cooper. 30 seconds.

16:25.159 --> 16:30.159
When you were in Pilgrim you gave the
amnesia pill to a man, Max, do you remember?

16:30.194 --> 16:33.159
What? You brought me all
the way back, just for Max?!

16:33.194 --> 16:34.720
We need to find him. Who is he?

16:34.755 --> 16:36.480
What's his surname?

16:36.515 --> 16:38.245
He was...

16:38.280 --> 16:42.005
some loser... We're losing her!
Stay here. Damn you!

16:42.040 --> 16:45.800
Don't force it, Gwen. She's not
getting away this time, stay here!

16:45.835 --> 16:48.205
No! I told you to stop!

16:48.240 --> 16:50.965
It's all right, I've got her,
I've got her...

16:51.000 --> 16:56.040
Hold on... OK, pulse. She's all right. We need
to get her out of here. Can you give me a hand?

16:56.075 --> 16:58.897
It's the glove,
I told you they get hooked.

16:58.932 --> 17:01.685
All right, don't make
a fuss, it's over now.

17:01.720 --> 17:05.483
Um, excuse me. I'm still counting.
There's not much point, she's dead.

17:05.519 --> 17:10.240
No, according to the equipment, she's
unconscious. What the hell's going on?

17:13.039 --> 17:16.204
Oh, my God. He's right.

17:16.239 --> 17:19.999
She's alive! Suzie's still alive.
Look at her, she's bloody breathing!

17:20.034 --> 17:21.319
She can't be...

17:22.279 --> 17:24.284
Nope.

17:24.319 --> 17:26.565
Still breathing.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.799
No stopping her. She won't die.

17:28.834 --> 17:30.999
One minute thirty and counting.

17:31.034 --> 17:34.360
MACHINE BEEPS

17:59.879 --> 18:02.080
How long's it been?

18:02.115 --> 18:04.817
Three months.

18:04.852 --> 18:07.646
When can I die?

18:07.681 --> 18:10.405
I just want to go.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.480
Can't you leave me alone?

18:14.040 --> 18:15.559
You seem to be stuck.

18:19.399 --> 18:20.679
But...

18:22.999 --> 18:25.440
Am I gonna stay like this?

18:25.475 --> 18:27.457
For how long?

18:27.492 --> 18:29.440
Don't know.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.780
Can I see my father? No.

18:34.815 --> 18:37.107
You wiped your records.

18:37.142 --> 18:39.364
We had no trace of him.

18:39.399 --> 18:43.239
So, he doesn't even know that I'm
dead? Well, you're not any more.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.400
This is sick.

18:46.435 --> 18:48.000
You started it.

18:49.879 --> 18:53.280
Right now, we've got an
investigation underway.

18:53.315 --> 18:55.724
Pilgrim.

18:55.759 --> 19:03.040
You visited these Pilgrim meetings and gave an
amnesia pill to someone called Max. How do we find him?

19:03.075 --> 19:04.685
What for? What did he do?

19:04.720 --> 19:06.644
He was just an ordinary bloke.

19:06.679 --> 19:09.960
We think the Retcon
triggered a psychosis.

19:09.995 --> 19:11.524
He's started killing.

19:11.559 --> 19:14.764
How many victims? Three. Same as you.

19:14.799 --> 19:19.639
We need to know, how much
Retcon did you give him?

19:19.674 --> 19:21.524
Owen. Hello.

19:21.559 --> 19:23.324
Scared to face me?

19:23.359 --> 19:26.239
You frighten
the shit out of me, yeah.

19:26.274 --> 19:29.120
What about Toshiko?
Is she still here?

19:31.080 --> 19:33.884
Yeah, she's here.

19:33.919 --> 19:36.125
All the gang. Happy days.

19:36.160 --> 19:40.399
But the amnesia pills,
how many did you give him?

19:40.434 --> 19:44.160
One a week. Every week.
For two years.

19:44.195 --> 19:45.245
Christ! No wonder.

19:45.280 --> 19:48.999
What the hell did you do that for?
I just...

19:49.034 --> 19:52.565
I wanted someone to talk to.

19:52.600 --> 19:55.960
About this place.
It was driving me mad.

19:56.800 --> 19:59.165
And he was just...

19:59.200 --> 20:02.324
He listened, that's all, he listened.

20:02.359 --> 20:06.079
Every week, as soon as I'd finished
talking, I'd give him the pill.

20:06.114 --> 20:10.560
You overdosed him.
I didn't know that!

20:10.595 --> 20:13.125
Keep getting it wrong, don't I?

20:13.160 --> 20:16.639
Is that why you brought me back? Did
you think I wasn't guilty enough?

20:16.674 --> 20:19.356
What was his surname? I don't know.

20:19.391 --> 20:22.039
All I ever did was talk about me.

20:25.479 --> 20:27.360
It's all my fault, isn't it?

20:28.920 --> 20:31.560
Never bloody stops being my fault.

20:33.880 --> 20:36.140
Can't you just let me die?

20:36.175 --> 20:38.400
You don't get off that easy.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.600
Yeah, you did warn me,
right at the beginning.

20:43.635 --> 20:46.760
He said, "This is the one
job you can never quit. "

20:46.795 --> 20:48.200
Then let's get to work.

20:49.959 --> 20:52.204
Come on, Suzie!

20:52.239 --> 20:54.199
Just like the old days.

20:54.234 --> 20:56.160
There's gotta be something.

21:06.679 --> 21:09.520
Hold on... There's someone missing.

21:09.555 --> 21:11.520
This girl came every week,

21:11.555 --> 21:15.244
student, blonde...

21:15.279 --> 21:17.319
She's not in these photos.

21:17.354 --> 21:19.957
Who was she? Lucy.

21:19.992 --> 21:22.560
Lucy Mackenzie.

21:24.799 --> 21:27.360
Said she worked at a club.
Which one?

21:27.395 --> 21:30.005
Uhhh...

21:30.040 --> 21:31.799
Come on, Suzie?

21:31.834 --> 21:33.524
Which club?

21:33.559 --> 21:37.759
For God's sake, this Max is killing
every single member of Pilgrim.

21:37.794 --> 21:42.840
Now tell me, Lucy Mackenzie,
where did she work, which club?!

21:42.875 --> 21:44.040
Wolf.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.920
The Wolf Bar.

21:52.279 --> 21:54.919
POUNDING ROCK MUSIC

21:59.599 --> 22:00.919
Cover the exits.

22:02.040 --> 22:07.200
Bloody hell, like I didn't have
a banging headache already.

22:07.235 --> 22:09.177
That's the glove, Gwen.

22:09.212 --> 22:11.084
Gets inside your mind.

22:11.119 --> 22:16.440
Yeah, all right Suzie, stop creeping me out. Just
tell us, any sign of Max or this Lucy Mackenzie?

22:16.475 --> 22:20.765
Nothing yet. Keep moving round.
Keep alert, people.

22:20.800 --> 22:27.799
To repeat, Max is described as 40, six-three, six-four,
stocky, short dark hair, tattoo down his left arm.

22:27.834 --> 22:30.240
That narrows it down.

22:31.439 --> 22:33.925
Can't even look at me, can you?

22:33.960 --> 22:36.399
It's not like you
to be so judgemental.

22:36.434 --> 22:39.717
Not like you to go
on a murder spree.

22:39.752 --> 22:42.756
All right, so it
drives us mad, this job.

22:42.791 --> 22:45.725
God knows, I've done
some stupid stuff.

22:45.760 --> 22:49.125
But now, I've got to keep
on working, every day,

22:49.160 --> 22:52.359
in a job that's got a bit
less honour, because of you.

22:57.999 --> 23:00.000
Wait, I've got a match on that guy.

23:02.839 --> 23:05.200
Where is he?
Northwest Bar. Show me.

23:07.159 --> 23:10.320
Owen, get in closer,
which one do you mean?

23:10.355 --> 23:12.604
Wait, he's going over for the...

23:12.639 --> 23:18.960
Wait, I've got a match on our girl, Lucy Mackenzie,
the student. That's her, that's definitely her.

23:18.995 --> 23:20.559
It's too late, he's going over.

23:23.759 --> 23:24.720
Got the bastard!

23:27.679 --> 23:29.080
That isn't him.

23:34.680 --> 23:36.399
Gwen! Behind you!

23:43.080 --> 23:44.965
That's one for lanto.

23:45.000 --> 23:49.045
Risen mitten, life knife
and that old classic,

23:49.080 --> 23:54.360
stun gun. Come on, let's get him
out of here. You saved my life.

23:54.395 --> 23:56.679
Maybe I came back for a reason.

23:58.080 --> 24:02.244
SIRENS WAIL

24:02.279 --> 24:06.759
OK, so your name is Max Tresillian,
can you confirm that?

24:06.794 --> 24:12.280
You live at 106 Endeavour
Terrace, is that right?

24:12.315 --> 24:16.200
Parents, Sandra and Dave, yeah?

24:18.400 --> 24:20.559
You're inside the
Torchwood facility.

24:20.594 --> 24:23.005
GROWLS

24:23.040 --> 24:26.479
And five, six...
Keep watching.

24:26.514 --> 24:28.520
Soon as we reach ten...

24:30.759 --> 24:32.405
Just stops dead.

24:32.440 --> 24:36.680
If this is a drug-induced psychosis,
it's a very specific one.

24:36.715 --> 24:38.880
Like he reacts to
the word Torchwood.

24:38.915 --> 24:40.999
Thanks, Jack.

24:42.919 --> 24:44.164
Sorry.

24:44.199 --> 24:48.280
But if that's caused by Retcon, we've
got a million more problems on the way.

24:49.879 --> 24:52.960
Let me know what the scan says.
But, what about Suzie?

24:52.995 --> 24:55.159
What are you gonna do with her?

24:55.194 --> 24:57.124
No idea.

24:57.159 --> 24:59.040
What do you think?

24:59.919 --> 25:02.280
You're the boss.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.260
Torchwood!

25:07.295 --> 25:08.880
GROWLS

25:11.320 --> 25:13.765
Can't you ask Jack?

25:13.800 --> 25:16.320
Just one favour?
I want to see my father.

25:18.240 --> 25:21.060
Tell us where he is,
we could bring him in.

25:21.095 --> 25:23.880
I'm not letting him
anywhere near Torchwood.

25:23.915 --> 25:26.117
If he's still alive.

25:26.152 --> 25:28.320
What's wrong with him?

25:30.159 --> 25:31.279
Cancer.

25:35.040 --> 25:38.400
All that waiting, and
then I go and die first.

25:39.279 --> 25:41.679
I could contact him on your behalf.

25:41.714 --> 25:43.279
And say what?

25:58.440 --> 26:01.879
So, tell me. Since I've been gone,
you enjoying it?

26:01.914 --> 26:06.159
Yes. Well, you know,
this place is sort of...

26:07.719 --> 26:12.639
It's mad, isn't it? Insane.
Bloody nuts. Best job I ever had.

26:12.674 --> 26:14.924
Me too. And the worst.
Yeah, tell me about it.

26:14.959 --> 26:17.760
Funny thing is, you always
imagine when you're dead,

26:17.795 --> 26:20.239
they're gonna miss me at work.

26:20.274 --> 26:21.760
Indispensable!

26:23.320 --> 26:25.440
But look what happened.

26:25.475 --> 26:27.399
I got replaced...

26:29.280 --> 26:31.439
.. by someone better.

26:33.359 --> 26:37.159
You got that glove working,
better than I did. Just got lucky.

26:37.194 --> 26:38.839
No, it's more than that.

26:40.480 --> 26:44.320
The others, they prefer you.
Don't say that.

26:44.355 --> 26:46.525
You got my job.

26:46.560 --> 26:48.040
Almost like you planned it.

26:49.359 --> 26:50.725
Except I didn't.

26:50.760 --> 26:55.279
And I'm sorry, but I've got
my own function at Torchwood

26:55.314 --> 26:58.240
and I'm a lot more
than just a replacement.

26:58.275 --> 26:59.920
Have you slept with Owen?

27:07.680 --> 27:11.200
There you go,
replaced me completely.

27:15.439 --> 27:18.559
I had a boyfriend who used
to walk into rooms like that.

27:18.594 --> 27:21.085
The grand entrance.
It got kind of boring.

27:21.120 --> 27:25.399
Although, he was one of twins, so
I put up with it. Twin acrobats.

27:25.434 --> 27:27.244
Man, I gotta write that book.

27:27.279 --> 27:31.279
Maybe even illustrate it. I can talk
for a long time, a very long time.

27:31.314 --> 27:34.119
Takes me a while to piece
things together. Meaning?

27:34.154 --> 27:35.804
Suzie had the glove.

27:35.839 --> 27:37.285
You put her in charge of it.

27:37.320 --> 27:41.760
But tell me, Jack, did you ever ask about
her father? How do you mean? He's got cancer.

27:41.795 --> 27:45.044
He's been dying
slowly now for years.

27:45.079 --> 27:50.799
And what do you do? You give his daughter the
one device that brings people back to life!

27:50.834 --> 27:55.039
Is it any wonder she got obsessed? Oh,
so is this all my fault?! Well, isn't it?

27:56.760 --> 27:59.320
Did you ever stop and think?

27:59.355 --> 28:00.925
Did you...

28:00.960 --> 28:02.839
Did you ever look at Suzie?

28:02.874 --> 28:05.725
Did you ever...

28:05.760 --> 28:09.039
think what that glove
would do to her, did you?

28:09.074 --> 28:10.604
Right from the start,

28:10.639 --> 28:13.399
you thought that Suzie's
death was because of you,

28:13.434 --> 28:15.164
Cos it happened when you arrived.

28:15.199 --> 28:20.719
Then you brought her back to life, all
the way, because you wanted it so much. OK!

28:23.839 --> 28:25.720
We're both responsible!

28:27.199 --> 28:30.199
Now, what the hell are we going
to do with her?! I don't know.

28:36.160 --> 28:39.164
What if she never dies?

28:39.199 --> 28:42.284
Have you thought of that? Like...

28:42.319 --> 28:46.405
Undying, forever. Just you and her.
No way. Could be.

28:46.440 --> 28:49.479
I wouldn't wish that on her.
I'd sooner kill her right now.

28:49.514 --> 28:53.004
Could you, though? Kill her?
Yeah. Really? Oh, yeah.

28:53.039 --> 28:58.240
'Jack, can you come to the conference room?
Something I need you to see. Kind of urgent. '

29:04.279 --> 29:07.099
I was going over Suzie
and Gwen's medical records.

29:07.134 --> 29:09.885
I ran them through the filter.
Watch the footage.

29:09.920 --> 29:14.959
This is the moment when Gwen brought
back Mark Brisco, the husband.

29:14.994 --> 29:16.924
See?

29:16.959 --> 29:19.085
Now look at his death. See?

29:19.120 --> 29:24.000
The energy flow stops
just as he's about to die. But...

29:24.035 --> 29:26.240
have a look at Gwen with Suzie.

29:28.960 --> 29:30.604
Whoa.

29:30.639 --> 29:32.479
What is that?

29:32.514 --> 29:33.976
Energy.

29:34.011 --> 29:35.404
Life.

29:35.439 --> 29:41.000
But with Suzie, it's a permanent connection and
she's getting stronger. It's still going, now.

29:41.035 --> 29:43.759
She's draining the life out of Gwen.

29:43.794 --> 29:45.600
There's always a price.

29:48.600 --> 29:52.800
More coffee? Is that all you do?
Just leave me alone.

29:52.835 --> 29:55.800
Have a biscuit, at least.

29:55.835 --> 29:58.484
Go on.

29:58.519 --> 29:59.880
Just for me.

30:04.120 --> 30:09.199
The wearer of the glove can bring somebody
back, but loses their own life in return.

30:09.234 --> 30:11.836
How do we stop it?

30:11.871 --> 30:13.975
We've got to kill her.

30:14.010 --> 30:16.044
Suzie's got to die.

30:16.079 --> 30:17.719
Again. Who's gonna do it?

30:17.754 --> 30:19.617
Like you said.

30:19.652 --> 30:21.480
I'm the boss.

30:32.880 --> 30:35.800
Toshiko! Where the hell's Suzie?
And where's Gwen?

30:35.835 --> 30:37.405
Interrogation Room.

30:37.440 --> 30:40.160
No they're not... Find them, fast!

30:47.800 --> 30:49.525
I can't see them.

30:49.560 --> 30:51.859
Hold on. Scanning. Nope.

30:51.894 --> 30:54.124
Nothing on internal scans.

30:54.159 --> 30:59.599
What's going on, where've they gone? Just
keep looking... Bring up the SUV. Still there.

30:59.634 --> 31:03.117
I'll try exteriors...
What about Gwen's car?

31:03.152 --> 31:06.565
What's she doing?
Getting herself fired.

31:06.600 --> 31:11.440
Unbelievable. How stupid is that? Thinking she
could just drive off. Come on. Let's go get them.

31:11.475 --> 31:13.440
What the hell...

31:17.200 --> 31:19.285
lanto?

31:19.320 --> 31:21.960
lanto? Captain!

31:21.995 --> 31:24.565
What happened?

31:24.600 --> 31:27.199
I thought you must've done it.

31:27.234 --> 31:28.996
We've gone into lockdown.

31:29.031 --> 31:30.759
Then reverse it! I can't.

31:30.794 --> 31:32.324
It's 100%.

31:32.359 --> 31:34.405
The doors are sealed.

31:34.440 --> 31:40.519
We're locked in! I'm taking you
to see your dad and that's it, OK?

31:43.279 --> 31:44.765
Sorry.

31:44.800 --> 31:47.360
I must be mad.

31:47.395 --> 31:49.477
Jack's not stupid.

31:49.512 --> 31:51.456
He's gonna catch us.

31:51.491 --> 31:53.485
Oh, you never know.

31:53.520 --> 31:55.480
We might get lucky.

31:58.999 --> 32:04.320
Everything's gone. Computers, mobile coverage,
the lifts, everything... We're sealed in.

32:04.355 --> 32:08.599
How long does Gwen have before she dies?
Two hours, maybe less. Come on! Think!

32:08.634 --> 32:12.559
If Suzie set up the lockdown, how
did she do it? Entered an override?

32:12.594 --> 32:15.437
She's officially dead,
she wouldn't get access.

32:15.472 --> 32:18.280
Then how did she do it?
What the hell did she do?!

32:21.000 --> 32:24.964
There's got to be an answer. Suzie
couldn't physically start the lockdown,

32:24.999 --> 32:29.960
Gwen wouldn't have let her. But there's no-one
else! Wait a minute... We've got a guest.

32:32.080 --> 32:33.365
.. Stopped for me

32:33.400 --> 32:37.340
The carriage held but just
ourselves and immortality

32:37.375 --> 32:41.280
Because I could not stop
for death... Is that a poem?

32:41.315 --> 32:44.245
I wonder. Emily Dickinson?

32:44.280 --> 32:47.165
But what does it mean?
It's a verbal trigger.

32:47.200 --> 32:52.084
Say it out loud, maybe repeat it 100
times over and the Hub locks down.

32:52.119 --> 32:57.400
But if that's part of the system, Suzie must've
installed a vocal command programme, way back.

32:57.435 --> 33:00.125
Back when she was alive, yeah.

33:00.160 --> 33:04.999
Max is just a Trojan horse. Suzie
planned this right from the start.

33:09.120 --> 33:13.959
'Do you see? Max, the Retcon, everything, it's
all been a hoax to get us to resurrect Suzie. '

33:13.994 --> 33:17.160
She gave Max a whole complex
of subconscious triggers.

33:17.195 --> 33:20.285
Like, she dies,
Max becomes a time bomb...

33:20.320 --> 33:24.159
He doesn't see her for three months
and, wham, the orders kick in.

33:24.194 --> 33:27.404
He follows Suzie's program,
and starts killing.

33:27.439 --> 33:30.724
And the whole chain of events
forces us to bring Suzie back.

33:30.759 --> 33:34.599
And then she escapes! That is not
bad! I'm picking her for my team.

33:34.634 --> 33:36.404
If she could lockdown the Hub,

33:36.439 --> 33:39.079
she must've installed
a way of reversing it.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.839
A bit more colour in your cheeks.

33:49.399 --> 33:51.720
It's all thanks to you.

33:54.759 --> 33:56.525
That night...

33:56.560 --> 33:59.800
my last night on Earth,
or so I thought...

34:01.560 --> 34:06.440
.. before I shot myself, I shot
Jack right through the head.

34:06.475 --> 34:11.320
I killed him, stone dead and
then he just stood up and lived.

34:11.355 --> 34:14.560
Am I right? Did that happen?

34:14.594 --> 34:16.320
Gwen? Yes, it did.

34:18.199 --> 34:21.559
So he can survive a bullet
through the head? Yeah. How?

34:21.594 --> 34:23.083
I don't know.

34:23.119 --> 34:24.764
He won't explain it properly.

34:24.799 --> 34:28.159
Said something happened
to him a while back. He said...

34:28.998 --> 34:32.280
He said he can't die.

34:32.315 --> 34:33.438
Not ever.

34:37.159 --> 34:41.039
And he makes judgments about
whether I'm allowed to live.

34:41.074 --> 34:44.719
It's all very easy for
Captain Jack, isn't it?

34:47.839 --> 34:50.239
Do you ever wonder? What?

34:50.274 --> 34:51.719
Who is he?

34:53.440 --> 34:54.920
All the time.

35:01.560 --> 35:03.919
DIALLING TONE
I've got reception, sir.

35:06.720 --> 35:08.325
How do you do that?

35:08.360 --> 35:12.000
We're sealed off! Just used
the Water Tower as a relay.

35:18.120 --> 35:19.560
Nice work, lanto!

35:22.920 --> 35:24.939
But who the hell do we phone?!

35:24.974 --> 35:26.959
PHONE RINGS
Detective Swanson.

35:26.994 --> 35:29.080
Who is it? Torchwood.

35:32.760 --> 35:35.285
You'd better not be wasting my time.

35:35.320 --> 35:41.319
I was wondering if you could do us a favour.
The humble police, helping the mighty Torchwood?

35:41.354 --> 35:46.039
Why don't you just help yourselves? Like you
normally do. Because we can't. Why's that?

35:46.200 --> 35:46.240
Why don't you just help yourselves? Like you
normally do. Because we can't. Why's that?

35:46.275 --> 35:48.164
We're sort of busy.

35:48.199 --> 35:51.164
Well, I'm busy too,
try someone else. No, no, no...

35:51.199 --> 35:56.560
It's just because we can't at the
moment because we're sort of stuck.

35:56.595 --> 35:58.760
In what way? We're locked in.

35:58.795 --> 36:00.245
You're locked in?

36:00.280 --> 36:02.244
Just a bit. Locked in where?

36:02.279 --> 36:06.240
Um. In our own base.
You're locked inside your own base?

36:06.275 --> 36:07.720
And it's not funny.

36:10.000 --> 36:14.479
And how am I supposed to help you,
exactly? We need a book of poetry.

36:14.514 --> 36:16.320
'It's NOT funny!'

36:19.159 --> 36:21.600
Oh, God, driving at night...

36:24.079 --> 36:26.799
GWEN SWITCHES RADIO ON

36:26.834 --> 36:29.519
# Just a little... #

36:29.554 --> 36:32.125
Oh, my God.

36:32.160 --> 36:33.799
I don't know this one.

36:35.479 --> 36:36.999
It's ancient.

36:39.919 --> 36:43.080
My Mum used to sing this,

36:43.115 --> 36:44.520
when I was a kid.

36:46.519 --> 36:49.084
All those years ago...

36:49.119 --> 36:51.640
# O-o-o-oh, soleil, soleil... #

36:51.675 --> 36:53.920
.. before I died.

36:55.439 --> 37:00.679
# Soleil, soleil

37:03.360 --> 37:07.285
# O-o-o-oh, soleil, soleil... #

37:07.320 --> 37:11.759
All right, Captain Jack, just say
that one more time. Nice and clear.

37:11.794 --> 37:15.399
We're locked in our
own base and we can't get out.

37:15.434 --> 37:16.925
LAUGHTER

37:16.960 --> 37:21.279
OK, you've had your fun. Listen, Detective
Swanson, one of our team is in danger.

37:21.314 --> 37:24.319
Right, you lot, back to work...

37:24.354 --> 37:26.764
OK, we've got it.

37:26.799 --> 37:31.724
The Complete Poems,
it's gonna cost you 20 quid.

37:31.759 --> 37:35.640
What does the book say? Er, I don't
know, what am I supposed to do?!

37:35.675 --> 37:38.125
Find I Could Not Stop For Death.

37:38.160 --> 37:40.879
Read out the next verse.
What if it doesn't work?

37:40.914 --> 37:42.736
Read out the whole book.

37:42.771 --> 37:44.559
It's gonna be a long night.

37:57.519 --> 37:59.919
Tired?

37:59.954 --> 38:02.285
I'm fine.

38:02.320 --> 38:05.365
Don't want you falling
asleep at the wheel.

38:05.400 --> 38:09.039
One corpse is enough for this
car, thanks. Don't say that.

38:09.074 --> 38:11.645
What? Corpse. Cos you're not.

38:11.680 --> 38:14.719
What am I, then?
I dunno, you're just not, though.

38:19.039 --> 38:21.925
When you're dead...

38:21.960 --> 38:24.764
I mean, when you die...
What happens?

38:24.799 --> 38:28.240
What do you want me to say?
The truth. Really?

38:28.275 --> 38:30.240
Tell me.

38:31.519 --> 38:36.044
You religious? Just sort of
in passing, you know.

38:36.079 --> 38:41.039
Do you believe in Heaven? I dunno.
Yes, you do. What do you believe?

38:42.919 --> 38:46.599
Stupid, but I always
sort of think...

38:48.199 --> 38:50.959
Like, you know,
white light and all that.

38:52.519 --> 38:54.079
And I think of my Gran.

38:55.639 --> 38:57.280
Like she'll be there.

38:57.315 --> 38:58.759
Waiting for me.

39:00.559 --> 39:03.005
The smell of carbolic.

39:03.040 --> 39:06.240
Your faith never left primary school.

39:08.559 --> 39:10.119
So what's out there?

39:11.439 --> 39:13.484
Nothing.

39:13.519 --> 39:15.319
Just nothing.

39:23.359 --> 39:28.239
But, if there's nothing,
what's the point of it all?

39:29.239 --> 39:31.045
This is.

39:31.080 --> 39:34.119
Driving through the dark.

39:34.154 --> 39:37.124
All this stupid, tiny stuff.

39:37.159 --> 39:39.840
We're just animals,
howling in the night,

39:39.875 --> 39:41.560
cos it's better than silence.

39:43.039 --> 39:47.919
I used to think about Torchwood,
all those aliens, coming to Earth...

39:47.954 --> 39:49.684
What the hell for?

39:49.719 --> 39:51.445
But it's just instinct.

39:51.480 --> 39:55.320
They come here cos
there's life, that's all.

39:55.355 --> 39:56.965
Moths around a flame.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.760
Creatures clinging
together in the cold.

40:00.795 --> 40:02.680
So when you die, it's just...

40:02.715 --> 40:04.964
Darkness.

40:04.999 --> 40:07.439
And you're all alone?
There's no-one else?

40:09.039 --> 40:12.120
I didn't say that. What do you mean?

40:13.719 --> 40:16.639
Why do you think I'm so
desperate to come back?

40:19.000 --> 40:22.080
There's something out there...

40:22.115 --> 40:23.599
in the dark...

40:26.520 --> 40:28.399
.. and it's moving.

40:33.559 --> 40:36.519
Parting is all we know of
heaven and all we need of hell.

40:36.554 --> 40:38.324
No, try another.

40:38.359 --> 40:44.000
Success is counted sweetest
by those who ne'er succeed.

40:44.035 --> 40:45.844
Christ, she was a bundle of laughs.

40:45.879 --> 40:49.399
Success is counted sweetest by
those who ne'er succeed. Nope.

40:49.434 --> 40:51.604
Wait a minute, just had a thought...

40:51.639 --> 40:55.320
If words cause the lockdown,
maybe numbers reverse it...

40:55.355 --> 40:58.205
Try the ISBN, every book's
got a different number.

40:58.240 --> 41:01.685
You getting this? Yup, hang on,
I'm looking... Read it out.

41:01.720 --> 41:05.920
The keyboards aren't working. The
membrane might recognise the code.

41:05.955 --> 41:07.404
OK. Got it!

41:07.439 --> 41:13.879
ISBN 0198600585.

41:17.079 --> 41:20.080
That's it! Everybody,
move, move! Cathy, thank you.

41:20.115 --> 41:21.600
Pleasure!

41:28.279 --> 41:34.439
I've got the tracker on Gwen's car. It's a
hospital. Giving you the co-ordinates now.

41:34.474 --> 41:40.600
On the way. How long's she got? It's only
a guess, but I'd give Gwen about 40 minutes.

41:40.635 --> 41:44.839
Kathy, I want the road ahead clear. I'm
gonna break the speed limit, big time.

41:44.874 --> 41:49.840
All units, give Torchwood priority,
repeat, give Torchwood priority.

41:52.440 --> 41:54.559
MACHINE BEEPS

42:06.360 --> 42:11.160
Suzie... I don't, em... I'm not...

42:13.199 --> 42:16.159
Oh, my God, this headache, it's...

42:24.600 --> 42:27.199
What's happening to me?

42:27.234 --> 42:30.044
I'm sorry, Gwen.

42:30.079 --> 42:32.199
You're getting shot in the head.

42:32.234 --> 42:34.964
Slowly.

42:34.999 --> 42:37.920
And believe me, it hurts.

42:37.955 --> 42:40.765
Almost better.

42:40.800 --> 42:43.320
Completely gone, soon.

42:43.355 --> 42:45.164
No!

42:45.199 --> 42:47.559
No, no, no...

42:54.799 --> 42:56.525
Dad?

42:56.560 --> 42:58.720
GWEN CRIES

42:58.755 --> 43:00.880
It's me, Dad.

43:02.919 --> 43:04.440
Wake up!

43:06.959 --> 43:08.479
Dad? It's Suzie.

43:13.759 --> 43:16.480
Hello, Dad.

43:17.519 --> 43:19.204
Ow!

43:19.239 --> 43:20.405
And goodbye.

43:20.440 --> 43:22.364
What are you doing?

43:22.399 --> 43:27.040
BEEPING
Oh, that's worth coming back for.

43:27.075 --> 43:28.925
Sending him into the dark.

43:28.960 --> 43:31.600
Just what the bastard deserves.

43:45.559 --> 43:49.679
They're moving again. Can't predict
a specific destination, not yet.

43:49.714 --> 43:52.999
Keep feeding it through,
we're catching up. PHONE RINGS

43:53.034 --> 43:54.365
Hello?

43:54.400 --> 43:56.800
Did you like the poem, Jack?

43:56.835 --> 43:59.165
Suzie, don't let her die.

43:59.200 --> 44:03.119
The glove is killing Gwen
and keeping you alive. I know.

44:03.154 --> 44:05.804
Then stop. But I get to live.

44:05.839 --> 44:08.280
Why would I stop? For Gwen's sake.

44:08.315 --> 44:10.124
She replaced me.

44:10.159 --> 44:13.324
Now, I'm doing the same
to her. Isn't that fair?

44:13.359 --> 44:19.964
Suzie, we've got a tracker on that
car, we're gonna catch up, I promise.

44:19.999 --> 44:26.200
And what happens then? If she's dead,
then I'm gonna kill you, Suzie Costello.

44:26.235 --> 44:30.799
I promise, I'm gonna kill you
for the last and final time.

44:30.834 --> 44:32.725
But would you?

44:32.760 --> 44:35.165
When there's a part of her
that's now me?

44:35.200 --> 44:39.079
Could you really do that
if I'm the only thing left of her?

44:39.114 --> 44:40.800
Why are you doing this?

44:42.040 --> 44:45.079
Because life is all, Jack.

44:45.114 --> 44:47.645
You should know.

44:47.680 --> 44:51.399
I'd do anything to stay.

44:51.434 --> 44:52.844
Anything.

44:52.879 --> 44:55.004
Suzie. Please. Just stop.

44:55.039 --> 45:01.159
She's a real find, this one.
Gwen Cooper.

45:01.194 --> 45:03.177
She's better than me.

45:03.212 --> 45:05.465
She's so much better.

45:05.500 --> 45:07.719
I was never any good.

45:10.399 --> 45:12.280
Jack, I'm sorry.

45:13.759 --> 45:16.484
SUZIE!

45:16.519 --> 45:21.485
Jack, she's heading for
the coast line on the B587.

45:21.520 --> 45:26.839
It's a place called Hedley Point, there's some sort
of ferry, goes out to the islands. Get a move on.

45:26.874 --> 45:26.919
Owen, how long we got?

45:26.954 --> 45:29.119
Minutes.

45:51.520 --> 45:53.199
It's beautiful, Gwen.

45:53.234 --> 45:55.119
Can you see?

45:56.479 --> 45:58.759
We'll take the ferry.

45:58.794 --> 46:01.004
Go out. As far as we can.

46:01.039 --> 46:03.619
Keep on running
cos he won't hurt us.

46:03.654 --> 46:06.199
We'll keep on going, you and me...

46:18.600 --> 46:19.840
Oh, I'm sorry.

46:21.280 --> 46:23.800
Have you gone? Gwen?

46:26.159 --> 46:29.799
Can you hear me? Gwen?

46:32.119 --> 46:33.439
Poor Gwen Cooper.

46:38.040 --> 46:39.319
Safe journey.

46:47.400 --> 46:48.520
Let her go.

46:48.555 --> 46:49.605
I can't.

46:49.640 --> 46:51.180
Let Gwen go. I can't.

46:51.215 --> 46:52.720
Owen, how is she?

46:54.240 --> 46:55.565
Owen! Report!

46:55.600 --> 46:58.799
I think we're too late.
If I kill you, does she live?

46:58.834 --> 47:01.765
But you can't, Jack.
Cos look at me.

47:01.800 --> 47:05.119
I'm the last thing left of
Gwen Cooper, can't you see it?

47:05.154 --> 47:07.040
Just the smallest bit of her?

47:07.075 --> 47:08.920
Not one bit.

47:10.519 --> 47:12.884
Owen? Anything?

47:12.919 --> 47:15.599
Nothing. But I broke the connection.

47:21.720 --> 47:24.559
I killed you. Can't die.

47:30.119 --> 47:32.844
Never gonna die.

47:32.879 --> 47:35.079
How much more of this do you want?

47:41.200 --> 47:43.880
It's all your fault, Jack.

47:43.915 --> 47:45.559
You recruited me.

47:49.800 --> 47:53.880
The glove. Tosh! Destroy the glove!
It's keeping them connected!

47:53.915 --> 47:56.879
lanto, armaments, code five.

48:02.759 --> 48:06.885
Captain, my captain.

48:06.920 --> 48:08.559
Do you want to know a secret?

48:14.359 --> 48:16.920
There's something moving in the dark

48:16.955 --> 48:18.657
and it's coming,

48:18.692 --> 48:20.359
Jack Harkness.

48:21.919 --> 48:23.920
It's coming for you.

48:27.319 --> 48:29.239
Whoah! Whoah! It's OK.

48:29.274 --> 48:31.159
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

48:31.194 --> 48:35.645
SIRENS WAIL

48:35.680 --> 48:40.520
# If I should die this very moment

48:41.600 --> 48:45.044
# I wouldn't fear

48:45.079 --> 48:51.079
# For I have never
known completeness

48:51.114 --> 48:55.205
# Like being here

48:55.240 --> 48:59.899
# Wrapped in the warmth of you

48:59.934 --> 49:04.066
# Loving every breath of you

49:04.101 --> 49:08.199
# Still my heart, this moment

49:08.234 --> 49:14.204
# Or it might burst

49:14.239 --> 49:19.400
# Could we stay right here
till the end of time?

49:19.435 --> 49:21.880
# Till the earth stops turning?

49:23.719 --> 49:30.639
# Wanna love you
till the seas run dry

49:30.674 --> 49:37.560
# I found the one
I've waited for. #

49:54.279 --> 49:56.760
Thanks for doing this.
Part of my job, sir.

49:56.795 --> 49:59.359
No, I should be doing it, but...

50:03.639 --> 50:06.640
One day, we're going
to run out of space...

50:10.799 --> 50:12.764
If you're interested...

50:12.799 --> 50:14.839
I've still got that stopwatch.

50:16.999 --> 50:18.244
So?

50:18.279 --> 50:21.845
Well. Well, think about it.

50:21.880 --> 50:24.559
Lots of things you can do
with a stopwatch.

50:26.120 --> 50:28.244
Oh, yeah.

50:28.279 --> 50:31.400
I can think of a few.
There's quite a list.

50:31.435 --> 50:34.057
I'll send the others home early.

50:34.092 --> 50:37.266
See you in my office in ten.

50:37.301 --> 50:40.440
That's ten minutes and counting.

50:46.080 --> 50:47.724
Oh, Jack?

50:47.759 --> 50:50.600
What do you want me to say
on the death certificate?

50:50.635 --> 50:52.485
Good question.

50:52.520 --> 50:54.520
She had quite a few
deaths in the end.

50:54.555 --> 50:55.960
I don't know.

50:57.839 --> 50:59.605
Death by Torchwood.

50:59.640 --> 51:01.444
I'll put a lock on the door,

51:01.479 --> 51:03.599
just in case she goes walking again.

51:03.634 --> 51:06.644
Nah, no chance of that.

51:06.679 --> 51:10.039
The resurrection days are over,
thank God.

51:10.074 --> 51:11.605
Oh, I wouldn't be too sure.

51:11.640 --> 51:13.639
That's the thing about gloves, sir.

51:15.319 --> 51:16.720
They come in pairs.

52:09.599 --> 52:11.840
