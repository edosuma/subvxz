WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.202
Only on Fox.

00:04.371 --> 00:06.506
Narrator:
Previously...

00:06.540 --> 00:08.542
in a Gordon Ramsay
master class...

00:08.576 --> 00:12.913
That's how you make
a delicious crab Benedict.

00:12.946 --> 00:14.982
...some home cooks
clawed to the top...

00:15.015 --> 00:16.249
I'm seriously impressed.

00:16.283 --> 00:18.051
That is perfectly cooked.

00:18.085 --> 00:20.320
...while others were
shell-shocked...

00:20.353 --> 00:22.756
Your hollandaise needs
more seasoning.

00:22.790 --> 00:25.158
Your hollandaise is broke.

00:25.192 --> 00:28.095
...and Olusola and Stephanie

00:28.128 --> 00:31.164
saw their "MasterChef" journey
come to an end.

00:31.198 --> 00:33.400
- Tonight...
- ( cheering )

00:33.433 --> 00:36.436
We're at one of the largest
breweries in the country.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.338
- ( horn honking )
- ( cheering )

00:38.371 --> 00:40.608
Ryan:
Chef Ramsay drives
forklifts, too?

00:40.641 --> 00:42.242
Leave something
for somebody else.

00:42.275 --> 00:44.444
Narrator:
...for the top 20...

00:44.477 --> 00:46.914
It's your first team challenge!

00:46.947 --> 00:48.916
- ( bell ringing )
- ( truck horn honking )

00:48.949 --> 00:50.450
...a storm is brewing.

00:50.483 --> 00:52.686
- We hungry?
- ( people shouting )

00:52.720 --> 00:56.289
- Oh, my God!
- All these hungry brewers
are like a swarm of bees.

00:56.323 --> 00:58.592
Narrator:
Who will rise to the top,

00:58.626 --> 01:01.895
- and whose MasterChef dream
will fizzle out?
- Look at this.

01:08.401 --> 01:10.403
( horses whinnying )

01:11.939 --> 01:14.274
( buzzer sounds )

01:14.307 --> 01:16.243
Look at all the beer!

01:16.276 --> 01:17.911
Lindsay: We've left
the MasterChef kitchen

01:17.945 --> 01:19.947
for the first time,
and we're at

01:19.980 --> 01:23.216
one of the largest breweries
in the country.

01:23.250 --> 01:26.453
- ( buzzer )
- ( cheering )

01:26.486 --> 01:28.822
There's machines moving
all around.

01:28.856 --> 01:31.591
It sounds like you're inside
of an airplane hangar.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.727
- ( horn honks )
- ( buzzer sounds )

01:33.761 --> 01:36.764
Everything's buzzing around
you, but it's so cool to see.

01:36.797 --> 01:37.998
The energy in there is awesome.

01:38.031 --> 01:41.034
( all cheering )

01:43.303 --> 01:44.938
( horn honks )

01:44.972 --> 01:46.273
Chelsea:
Oh, my God!

01:46.306 --> 01:48.208
- ( laughing )
- ( cheering )

01:50.778 --> 01:54.281
Taylor: It's hilarious
watching Joe and AarÃ³n

01:54.314 --> 01:56.316
pulling up in
that tiny little cart

01:56.349 --> 01:57.951
that looks like a LEGO.

01:57.985 --> 02:01.321
( horn honking )

02:01.354 --> 02:03.356
( cheers and applause )

02:05.325 --> 02:07.160
Ryan:
Not only does Chef Ramsay have

02:07.194 --> 02:09.830
Michelin-star restaurants
on multiple continents,

02:09.863 --> 02:11.198
he drives forklifts, too?

02:11.231 --> 02:12.465
Come on, man, like,

02:12.499 --> 02:14.134
leave something
for somebody else.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.136
- ( cheers and applause )
- Hello.

02:16.169 --> 02:19.006
- How are you, Chef?
- What in the hell are you doing

02:19.039 --> 02:22.609
with that on and
that silly hat?
Come on!

02:22.642 --> 02:24.812
- Safety first.
- Oh, please.

02:24.845 --> 02:27.514
Get it off. You guys,
get that stuff off! Come on.

02:27.547 --> 02:29.616
Dear, oh, dear.

02:29.649 --> 02:30.650
Let's go.

02:32.552 --> 02:35.222
Welcome to the incredible
Anheuser-Busch Brewery,

02:35.255 --> 02:38.826
the biggest brewer of beer
in the entire world!

02:38.859 --> 02:41.862
located right here
in sunny Southern California.

02:41.895 --> 02:45.365
Right. It's time for your first
big team challenge!

02:45.398 --> 02:48.736
( all cheering )

02:48.769 --> 02:54.007
You'll be cooking for 101
hard-working brewers.

02:54.041 --> 02:55.876
( all murmur )

02:55.909 --> 02:57.811
That's right.
And you're gonna be cooking

02:57.845 --> 03:00.080
with a secret ingredient.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.851
- Beer.
- ( all cheering )

03:05.953 --> 03:11.124
With this beer, teams will be
making one of these two dishes.

03:13.426 --> 03:15.495
all: Oh!

03:15.528 --> 03:17.530
Fried chicken sandwich

03:17.564 --> 03:21.735
with beer-battered onion rings,
and corn salad,

03:21.769 --> 03:25.338
or beer-battered
fish and chips

03:25.372 --> 03:27.107
with coleslaw
and tartar sauce.

03:27.140 --> 03:30.577
Two classic dishes
that are elevated

03:30.610 --> 03:33.881
when made with delicious,
fresh beer.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.952
AarÃ³n: Chelsea,
you were the very best

03:38.986 --> 03:41.554
in the crab
skill competition,
so come on up,

03:41.588 --> 03:42.890
'cause you're gonna be one
of today's captains.

03:42.923 --> 03:45.358
- Okay.
- ( cheers and applause )

03:45.392 --> 03:46.459
Chelsea: Oh, my God,
I'm the team captain!

03:46.493 --> 03:47.895
I mean, it's an honor,

03:47.928 --> 03:49.963
but this is way out
of my comfort zone.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.565
Bowen, you were the runner-up
in the crab skill competition,

03:52.599 --> 03:56.069
so you will be
the other captain.

03:56.103 --> 03:58.605
I don't think being a captain
of a golf team back in college

03:58.638 --> 04:01.741
will help me prepare
for 101 brewers today.

04:01.775 --> 04:05.278
Joe: Now, Chelsea,
which advantage do you want?

04:05.312 --> 04:08.315
Choosing what dish
your team will be making,

04:08.348 --> 04:10.383
or you can choose
your teammates?

04:10.417 --> 04:11.651
Oh, my God.

04:11.684 --> 04:13.653
( all laugh )

04:13.686 --> 04:15.923
- Oh, my God.
- Shanika: Chelsea,
if I was you, girl,

04:15.956 --> 04:17.624
pick the fish, pick the fish.

04:17.657 --> 04:20.127
Fish is so much easier.

04:20.160 --> 04:21.661
Work smart, not hard.

04:21.694 --> 04:23.563
Okay, I know what I'm gonna do.

04:23.596 --> 04:25.565
- What's it gonna be?
- I'm choosing my team.

04:25.598 --> 04:28.335
- There you go.
- ( cheers and applause )

04:28.368 --> 04:31.338
That was not a good choice,

04:31.371 --> 04:33.140
and I'm just hoping
that I'm not on Chelsea's team.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.574
- So, Captain.
- Yes.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.410
First pick on the blue team
is going where?

04:37.444 --> 04:39.913
All right, so, I'm choosing
Alecia on my team.

04:39.947 --> 04:43.083
- ( screams )
- Wow, well done.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.953
- ( laughs )
- Thank you.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.587
( screams )

04:47.620 --> 04:50.623
Okay, second choice.
Quick.

04:50.657 --> 04:53.827
- I choose Lindsay.
- Lindsay.

04:53.861 --> 04:56.496
Chelsea:
I'm picking my team because I
think if we have a strong team,

04:56.529 --> 04:58.131
they're the reason
we're gonna win today.

04:58.165 --> 05:02.269
So, for my next pick,
I'm choosing Taylor.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.004
No matter what protein we get,

05:04.037 --> 05:06.874
we have to fry
over 101 portions,

05:06.907 --> 05:08.141
and that's not gonna be easy.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.010
- Fourth pick.
- Okay. Juni.

05:10.043 --> 05:11.879
That's me!

05:11.912 --> 05:13.881
I wanna have a team
that will hopefully
back me up...

05:13.914 --> 05:15.148
I choose Darrick.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.783
...be great team players,

05:16.816 --> 05:19.019
and just listen to me
and actually

05:19.052 --> 05:20.487
do the job I ask them to do.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.822
I would like to choose Farhan.

05:22.856 --> 05:24.557
Farhan, let's go.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.126
- Yes!
- Next.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.128
- I choose Cesar.
- Cesar.

05:28.161 --> 05:30.830
( cheers and applause )

05:30.864 --> 05:32.866
- Next one.
- Okay, I choose Shanika.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.367
Gordon:
Wow!

05:34.401 --> 05:36.003
Welcome to the blue team.

05:36.036 --> 05:39.172
Shanika: I'm not excited
because we have a team

05:39.206 --> 05:41.574
full of strong individuals.

05:43.376 --> 05:45.345
My very last pick
today is Emily.

05:45.378 --> 05:47.480
- Emily.
- ( cheers )

05:47.514 --> 05:50.383
Shanika:
It is going to take somebody
even stronger to lead us,

05:50.417 --> 05:53.220
and I'm not sure if Chelsea
can take this task on.

05:55.122 --> 05:56.924
Joe:
All right, so, red team,

05:56.957 --> 05:58.525
come down here
and get your aprons, please.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.928
( cheers and applause )

06:00.961 --> 06:04.197
We have such a strong team
right now.

06:04.231 --> 06:08.001
Mark has worked in restaurants
before with his family.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.103
S.J.'s a really great listener.

06:10.137 --> 06:12.205
Ryan is super strong
with his knife skills.

06:12.239 --> 06:14.741
I'm glad Chelsea didn't pick me!

06:14.774 --> 06:17.444
Bowen, you have a big
advantage now,

06:17.477 --> 06:20.247
on deciding
which dish you cook,

06:20.280 --> 06:22.349
and which dish
the blue team cook.

06:22.382 --> 06:24.684
I'm thinking about doing
the fish and chip.

06:24.717 --> 06:27.587
Nice. Smart.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.123
Captains, please, join your
teams in the center. Thank you.

06:30.157 --> 06:31.558
( cheers and applause )

06:31.591 --> 06:33.426
I choose the fish and chip,

06:33.460 --> 06:37.397
because I know S.J. worked
with fish to get his apron.

06:37.430 --> 06:39.432
He's gonna do great.

06:39.466 --> 06:43.603
On average, Americans
spend $10 a day on lunch.

06:43.636 --> 06:46.539
So, we supplied each
brewery employee

06:46.573 --> 06:51.778
with their very own
MasterChef $10 bill.

06:51.811 --> 06:53.580
- ( laughs )
- Come on.

06:53.613 --> 06:55.448
Money's never looked
this good before.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.053
Now, employees will eat
both team's dishes,

07:00.087 --> 07:03.490
and then choose which one
they like best

07:03.523 --> 07:06.426
by rewarding that team
with their $10.

07:06.459 --> 07:09.997
The team that collects
the most lunch money wins.

07:10.030 --> 07:12.665
- Understood?
- All: Yes, Chef.

07:14.934 --> 07:18.338
Joe: Okay, red team,
blue team, this is it.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.940
You will have
75 minutes to prep.

07:20.974 --> 07:24.811
Your time starts...

07:24.844 --> 07:27.247
- ...now.
- Let's go, guys!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

07:27.280 --> 07:29.282
- Get that corn on the grill!
- We got this, we got this.

07:29.316 --> 07:31.484
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go! Let's go!

07:31.518 --> 07:33.120
Chelsea:
Set up your station, guys.

07:33.153 --> 07:35.022
Farhan, you need to start
cooking chicken.

07:35.055 --> 07:37.357
- I'm about to start.
- Bowen: Teamwork, teamwork.

07:37.390 --> 07:40.493
- Right, guys?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.

07:40.527 --> 07:42.295
Gordon:
So, first big team challenge

07:42.329 --> 07:44.831
out of the comfort of that
incredible MasterChef kitchen.

07:44.864 --> 07:47.667
Joe: How difficult is it
to fry food in general well,

07:47.700 --> 07:49.369
and then to do it
for a hundred people?

07:49.402 --> 07:51.038
Well, let's talk
about the blue team first.

07:51.071 --> 07:52.872
So, they've got the most
amazing chicken sandwich.

07:52.905 --> 07:55.475
We know if that fryer
is way too hot,

07:55.508 --> 07:57.277
the batter's gonna cook
too quickly.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.711
So on the outside
it looks cooked,

07:58.745 --> 08:00.047
but on the inside
that chicken's raw.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.015
Cesar, leave it
at 200, please.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.950
AarÃ³n: The idea is hold it
in the oven for a little bit,

08:03.983 --> 08:06.119
get it to a temperature,
keep its integrity,

08:06.153 --> 08:07.554
make sure it has its crunch
and its moisture.

08:07.587 --> 08:09.889
Farhan, I'm just dropping
these in. How long?

08:09.922 --> 08:13.160
- About eight minutes.
- The fish and chips
from the red team.

08:13.193 --> 08:15.962
So, they've got their work cut
out, because that fish needs
to be lightly salted,

08:15.995 --> 08:18.398
extracts the moisture out
of them, then lightly floured,
and then that batter.

08:18.431 --> 08:21.201
But that batter's too thick.
It'll never get crispy.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.136
And there's potential issues
with the fries.

08:23.170 --> 08:25.338
If you dunk too many in,
they're gonna congeal,

08:25.372 --> 08:27.140
and they're gonna make a mess.

08:27.174 --> 08:28.408
We have a hundred
of these, right?

08:28.441 --> 08:30.143
- Yeah.
- More than a hundred.

08:30.177 --> 08:32.679
Matt, Matt, I need
somebody to fry the fish.

08:32.712 --> 08:34.347
Bowen:
Right now I need fish.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.216
It don't need--
it don't need
to go down now.

08:36.249 --> 08:37.484
I don't care.

08:37.517 --> 08:39.386
Bowen's starting to freak out.

08:39.419 --> 08:41.254
He's really concerned
that we won't be able

08:41.288 --> 08:43.890
to pump out enough food on
time, especially for the fish.

08:43.923 --> 08:46.059
- Bowen, you sure?
- I'm sure.

08:46.093 --> 08:48.361
Even though I may
not agree with him,
at the end of the day,

08:48.395 --> 08:49.762
I'll take whatever task that--

08:49.796 --> 08:51.164
you know, that the captain
tells me to do.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.699
- Okay.
- Bowen: I'm sure.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.734
I don't wanna lose.

08:58.638 --> 08:59.939
Chelsea:
Hey, guys. What's going on?

08:59.972 --> 09:01.674
- Waiting on you, boss.
- Is that too thick?

09:01.708 --> 09:04.111
That's way too thin.
Less is more, less is more.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.878
- For the beer batter?
- Yeah.

09:05.912 --> 09:07.880
Emily: I can see that visibly
Chelsea is stressed,

09:07.914 --> 09:09.882
and she should be.

09:09.916 --> 09:11.684
As a team leader, a lot
of the weight of our success,

09:11.718 --> 09:13.120
you know, comes down
on her shoulders.

09:13.153 --> 09:14.254
Do you have enough
onion rings cut?

09:14.287 --> 09:15.522
Like, how many more do you need?

09:15.555 --> 09:18.591
- A lot. A lot.
- Oh, my God.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.760
Unfortunately, the blue team
is completely out of control.

09:20.793 --> 09:22.695
Hey, Darrick, did you hear me?
Take all your corn at once.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.531
No! I'm not doing it
all at once.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.300
- I wanna test some first.
- Everyone is running around,

09:27.334 --> 09:29.236
not executing at a high level.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.771
You do not want
a line of flour
underneath your batter.

09:31.804 --> 09:33.640
- It's not gonna cook off.
- It's not my first time
frying chicken.

09:33.673 --> 09:35.275
Emily: We need leadership
and we need communication

09:35.308 --> 09:36.943
and we need
to pull it together,

09:36.976 --> 09:38.711
otherwise we are gonna end up
in that pressure test.

09:38.745 --> 09:41.314
- Chelsea,
give us direction, baby.
- Yes?

09:41.348 --> 09:42.882
Make sure you're on us.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.785
- Okay, I'm sorry.
- Lead us, please.

09:49.456 --> 09:51.258
Bowen:
Guys, keep working!

09:51.291 --> 09:55.162
Red team, 15 minutes to go
before our guests turn up.

09:55.195 --> 09:56.896
Get some baskets ready, guys.
Come on!

09:56.929 --> 09:58.097
- This fish is ready.
- Okay.

09:58.131 --> 10:00.267
Start putting 'em
in the trays.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.269
- Can't we just bring everything
up to the front?
- No, listen to me.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.971
- Ashley! Ashley, listen to me.
- Red team, stop!

10:05.004 --> 10:07.039
- Just put the container
in the tray!
- Stop!

10:09.709 --> 10:11.511
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, Chef.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.146
Bring me that tray of fish
that's cooked.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.615
Yes, Chef.

10:15.648 --> 10:17.684
Why are we cooking this now?

10:17.717 --> 10:19.586
It's gonna sit there
for ten minutes.

10:19.619 --> 10:21.288
What's gonna happen to this
in ten minutes?

10:21.321 --> 10:22.955
- They're gonna get soggy.
- Gonna get soggy.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.257
Now look at that one.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.792
That's not even cooked.

10:25.825 --> 10:28.361
- That's ice-cold in there.
- Oh, my gosh.

10:28.395 --> 10:31.130
It's soaking wet
and it's greasy as ( bleep )!

10:32.732 --> 10:35.268
Bowen:
The fish is soggy
like a diaper.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.136
This is such embarrassment.

10:37.170 --> 10:39.005
Look at this.

10:39.038 --> 10:40.740
This is madness!

10:48.047 --> 10:50.550
Red team, I've got raw fish,

10:50.583 --> 10:52.519
barely battered fish.

10:54.221 --> 10:56.956
- Our timing's way off.
- Yes, Chef.

10:56.989 --> 10:58.658
In under ten minutes from now,
we're open.

10:58.691 --> 11:00.493
Get organized.
Let's go.

11:00.527 --> 11:03.029
So we shouldn't have
started it so early.

11:03.062 --> 11:04.964
I'm so stupid.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.534
I should've just told Bowen
when it's time to cook the fish.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.736
Please, S.J.,
I thought you'd know better.

11:09.769 --> 11:11.170
- Yes, Chef.
- I'm begging now.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.405
Get your ( bleep ) together!

11:12.439 --> 11:13.973
- Okay? Come on!
- Yes, Chef.

11:14.006 --> 11:15.642
S.J.:
Gordon is so disappointed.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.009
( bleep )!

11:17.043 --> 11:18.378
He chose me for a reason,
you know.

11:18.411 --> 11:20.480
He gave me the pin
with that apron

11:20.513 --> 11:22.482
and I feel like
I'm just letting him down.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.716
I gotta step it up right now.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.685
Come on, guys,
get that fish out!

11:32.525 --> 11:35.595
( bell ringing )

11:35.628 --> 11:38.631
( horns honking )

11:41.133 --> 11:42.569
Red team, blue team.

11:42.602 --> 11:45.272
Our brewery workers are
arriving.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.875
- ( horns honking )
- ( people clamoring )

11:48.908 --> 11:51.210
We need chicken at the front.
Guests are arriving.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.179
Alecia:
Oh, my goodness!

11:53.212 --> 11:55.882
All these hungry brewers are
like a swarm of bees.

11:55.915 --> 11:58.551
They got their hard hats on.
They came right off the line,

11:58.585 --> 11:59.852
and they're ready to eat.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.888
- We hungry?
- ( people shouting )

12:01.921 --> 12:03.723
Gerron:
They comin', they comin', y'all!

12:03.756 --> 12:06.459
- They comin'. Let's get it!
- Bowen, go expedite!

12:06.493 --> 12:08.461
Bowen:
That's a lot of people!

12:10.263 --> 12:12.565
Red team, blue team,
we are open!

12:12.599 --> 12:14.867
- Welcome.
- ( people cheering )

12:14.901 --> 12:17.570
- Let's go.
- Let's go! Bring it on!

12:17.604 --> 12:19.939
Gerron:
Fish and chips hot,
come and get it!

12:19.972 --> 12:21.408
Mark:
How's it going, guys?

12:21.441 --> 12:23.142
- You're welcome.
- Thanks for coming.

12:23.175 --> 12:25.945
We got fish coming.
You got fish?

12:25.978 --> 12:28.648
- I'm dropping about five
portions of fish right now.
- You're doing great, guys!

12:28.681 --> 12:30.417
Shanika, corn!

12:30.450 --> 12:32.319
Lindsay:
We got beer-battered
chicken sandwich

12:32.352 --> 12:34.554
with some beer-battered onion
rings and some corn salad.

12:34.587 --> 12:36.122
I hope you enjoy!

12:36.155 --> 12:38.157
- We're hoping you guys enjoy.
- Thank you.

12:38.190 --> 12:39.826
There you go.
I'll get some more chicken up.

12:39.859 --> 12:42.128
Chelsea, I don't want them
standing there with nothing.

12:42.161 --> 12:43.596
- Okay, okay.
- So we go up there,
we expedite.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.264
We need a system though,
don't we?

12:45.298 --> 12:48.134
Lindsay, I need you to do--
like, make the sandwich.

12:48.167 --> 12:50.002
Oh, okay.

12:50.036 --> 12:51.471
I assumed Chelsea,
as the team captain,

12:51.504 --> 12:52.739
would be expediting
at some point,

12:52.772 --> 12:54.574
but it becomes very clear

12:54.607 --> 12:56.275
that she's in the weeds
with the chicken.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.445
We are not prepared

12:58.478 --> 13:00.313
for 101 brewers to come through.

13:00.347 --> 13:02.281
AarÃ³n:
Lindsay, let's go.
We gotta keep going.

13:02.315 --> 13:03.683
This line ain't going anywhere.

13:03.716 --> 13:05.352
Lindsay:
Heard, Chef.

13:07.887 --> 13:09.789
I need fries now!

13:09.822 --> 13:12.124
- Mark: I got two minutes
on fries.
- No, now!

13:12.158 --> 13:15.027
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Guys, let's bring it down.

13:15.061 --> 13:18.998
- Oh, my God.
- Mark: Nobody told me
they needed fries.

13:19.031 --> 13:21.468
Julia:
There's a line halfway
down the block,

13:21.501 --> 13:22.835
and we're waiting on fries?

13:22.869 --> 13:25.204
- Oh, my God!
- Mark, I get it.

13:25.237 --> 13:27.139
You worked in your family's
restaurant, but you know what?

13:27.173 --> 13:29.476
This Chicago-Italian girl has
a family restaurant, too.

13:29.509 --> 13:32.379
So I really don't know
what you're doing over here.

13:32.412 --> 13:34.881
They're fries, Mark!
Come on, get it together!

13:34.914 --> 13:36.349
Bowen, I got your fries
right here.

13:36.383 --> 13:38.351
Okay, thanks.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.658
When you see something
you're not quite happy with,
you double-check it.

13:45.692 --> 13:47.894
Yeah, that chicken's
not going out, Chef.

13:47.927 --> 13:50.663
- That's not an appropriate
piece of chicken.
- Oh, my Lord.

13:50.697 --> 13:53.400
Gordon:
Blue team! Hey, stop.

13:53.433 --> 13:55.835
You, you, come here.
You, come here.

13:57.737 --> 14:00.139
Look, look.
Look, what's that there?

14:00.172 --> 14:02.509
- Chelsea: It's raw.
- That's not 30 seconds.

14:02.542 --> 14:04.711
No, that's ( bleep )
minutes away.

14:06.045 --> 14:09.348
I feel so embarrassed.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.017
The batter is way too thick.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.585
Come on, guys!

14:12.619 --> 14:15.855
We don't get this
figured out right now,

14:15.888 --> 14:17.524
here we come pressure test.

14:17.557 --> 14:19.392
I'm not serving that.
Are you?

14:19.426 --> 14:21.528
- No, sir.
- No. Get them in the trash.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.195
And, trust me, if we could
salvage it, I'd salvage it,

14:23.229 --> 14:25.832
but you know damn well
we can't salvage that.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.634
Come on, don't give, guys!
Don't give up!

14:29.602 --> 14:32.772
( indistinct chatter )

14:32.805 --> 14:35.341
Good afternoon!
Happy lunchtime, employees!

14:35.374 --> 14:38.377
I wanna ask: the blue team made
fried chicken sandwich,

14:38.411 --> 14:40.547
the red team made
the fish and chips.

14:40.580 --> 14:42.549
- What was your favorite?
- Chicken sandwich is great.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.851
The bread is--
I like that little toast on it.

14:44.884 --> 14:47.420
- The corn slaw,
flavor was just on point.
- All right. Great.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.121
Sir, red team or blue team?

14:49.155 --> 14:51.023
I like the chicken,
but I'm gonna go with the fish.

14:51.057 --> 14:53.460
- It was battered good,
it was crisp.
- Great.

14:53.493 --> 14:56.529
Keep going with the fish.
It looks good.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.397
The blue team's chicken sandwich
was a little dry.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.533
Hey, I just touched
those two with flour.

15:00.567 --> 15:03.035
- That's cross-contamination.
Those gotta go.
- Okay, okay.

15:03.069 --> 15:04.537
Be careful, there's four pieces
of chicken that you ruined.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.038
- It wasn't intentional.
- I understand.

15:06.072 --> 15:07.306
Just be careful, please.

15:07.339 --> 15:08.808
Darrick, please just slow down.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.543
You're wasting all
of our chicken.

15:10.577 --> 15:13.480
Ah, damn it!
Those two are stuck together.

15:13.513 --> 15:15.715
The fish of the red team
was a little greasy,

15:15.748 --> 15:18.751
and the coleslaw was
on the bland side.

15:22.021 --> 15:23.956
Bowen:
Fries right here.

15:23.990 --> 15:25.725
Are they soggy,
those fries?

15:25.758 --> 15:28.294
- Come on.
- How'd they look?

15:28.327 --> 15:29.596
It's cold and it's limp.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.631
Touch that.

15:31.664 --> 15:33.432
- This is raw.
- Hey, we need fries up here.

15:33.466 --> 15:35.668
- Fries, fries, fries.
- Mark.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.269
- Yeah?
- Talk to me.
What is going on?

15:37.303 --> 15:38.971
I got fries working right now.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.306
I was let know at the last
minute on the first order,

15:40.339 --> 15:42.074
and I'm just trying
to catch up.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.910
- Did anyone tell you,
"Drop the fries?"
- No.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.112
Where's our communication?

15:46.145 --> 15:48.481
Mark:
They keep asking for fries,
they keep asking for fries,

15:48.515 --> 15:50.282
but I don't think they hear me,

15:50.316 --> 15:52.418
me calling out, "Two minutes on
fries, five minutes on fires."

15:52.451 --> 15:54.987
Bowen, if you want fries
and I put up something

15:55.021 --> 15:57.089
that's underdone
and they're raw,

15:57.123 --> 15:59.358
and you take my raw fries,
that's on you.

15:59.391 --> 16:01.293
- Gordon: S.J.
- S.J.: Yes, Chef.

16:01.327 --> 16:03.029
- How many portions of fish
you dropped?
- About eight.

16:03.062 --> 16:04.296
- Have you told him?
- No, Chef.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.532
Oh, my God!

16:05.565 --> 16:07.834
- What goes with chips?
- Fri-- fish.

16:07.867 --> 16:09.836
Fish, you ( bleep ) donut!
Talk to each other!

16:09.869 --> 16:11.103
- You're standing opposite!
- Absolutely.

16:11.137 --> 16:12.672
Absolutely. I'm sorry.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.273
Guys, there's a lot of people
walking by you

16:14.306 --> 16:16.142
without fish and chips.

16:16.175 --> 16:18.177
So what's the likelihood
they're gonna vote for y'all?

16:18.210 --> 16:20.412
Just throwing that out there.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.717
Lindsay:
All right, guys,
I need chicken!

16:24.751 --> 16:27.319
Chelsea, we're not gonna
have enough chicken.

16:27.353 --> 16:29.656
Oh!

16:29.689 --> 16:31.791
Oh, my God!

16:31.824 --> 16:33.025
This is horrifying to me.

16:33.059 --> 16:34.561
Because Darrick messed up

16:34.594 --> 16:36.028
so much chicken
in the beginning,

16:36.062 --> 16:38.230
we don't have enough left
to serve.

16:38.264 --> 16:39.799
Lindsay:
I need onion rings.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.568
Blue team,
where's the onion rings?

16:41.601 --> 16:43.502
- Juni: Uh, they're coming.
- Have we run out?

16:43.536 --> 16:45.838
Yes. I'm making some more
right now.

16:45.872 --> 16:48.474
- Chelsea. I haven't given up.
- Yes?

16:48.507 --> 16:51.243
- And nor should you.
- Um, we're out of chicken.

16:51.277 --> 16:53.312
- What?
- We're out of chicken.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.748
Chelsea:
I don't know what to do.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.917
We are going down.

17:06.893 --> 17:11.230
Um... we-- we're out
of chicken, Chef.

17:11.263 --> 17:13.032
Shanika:
Oh, my God!

17:13.065 --> 17:16.368
Chelsea has got to be
the worst team captain ever.

17:16.402 --> 17:18.370
We don't have chicken
and we have people.

17:18.404 --> 17:19.872
We have hungry people
that are standing there.

17:19.906 --> 17:21.373
- Darrick.
- Yes, Chef?

17:21.407 --> 17:24.110
How many portions of chicken
have we ruined?

17:24.143 --> 17:25.778
- I don't know, Chef. I--
- You don't know.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.580
- Farhan.
- We've ruined 20.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.281
I-- I've seen 20 go!

17:29.315 --> 17:31.618
That means that there's more
than 20 that has gone.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.285
I honestly don't know
what to do.

17:33.319 --> 17:34.687
I'd rather serve them
half a portion of chicken,

17:34.721 --> 17:36.055
- than nothing at all.
- Okay.

17:36.088 --> 17:37.123
We may be down,
but we're not out.

17:37.156 --> 17:38.758
Okay.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.526
I'm feeling defeated
but I'm not giving up.

17:40.559 --> 17:42.762
We're out of chicken.
We have to slice this in half.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.031
I stepped in and got Darrick
off his station,

17:45.064 --> 17:47.233
because I have to take over
the chicken with Farhan,

17:47.266 --> 17:48.968
and we have to finish
the service.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.037
Everyone is gonna
get cooked chicken

17:51.070 --> 17:52.271
if it's the last thing I do.

17:52.304 --> 17:54.240
Keep going.
Yes, perfect.

17:54.273 --> 17:56.575
- Here we go.
- Come on, blue team, please.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.713
( people cheering )

18:00.747 --> 18:03.482
All right, guys,
we gotta speed it up.
We gotta speed it up.

18:03.515 --> 18:05.785
- Go, red team!
- Bowen: Thank you, guys.

18:05.818 --> 18:08.655
Ralph: The red team's
working more cohesively.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.823
We have the fries
perfectly brown.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.992
- We have the fish ready.
- Julia: I need fish!

18:13.025 --> 18:14.927
Bring it up here, Bowen.

18:14.961 --> 18:16.262
And thank God we have Julia
on our team.

18:16.295 --> 18:19.832
She is expediting this
like a pro.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.433
Guys, keep it going.

18:21.467 --> 18:22.969
Fish is coming!
Fish is coming!

18:23.002 --> 18:24.971
Let's go!
Put it up forward.

18:25.004 --> 18:27.840
Got you. I got all my eight
coming out in about two minutes.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.341
We're good, guys.
Keep it going.

18:32.511 --> 18:35.514
Is anyone gonna give their vote
to the blue team?

18:35.547 --> 18:37.149
The red team?

18:37.183 --> 18:38.617
( all cheering )

18:38.651 --> 18:40.352
Full house for the red team.
Thanks, guys.

18:40.386 --> 18:41.954
Brewer: I'd say definitely
not the red team.

18:41.988 --> 18:43.422
As soon as I bit into the fish
I didn't like

18:43.455 --> 18:45.925
how a lot of oil
actually came out of the fish.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.259
So, it wasn't enjoyable.

18:47.293 --> 18:49.261
I need fish.
Right now I need fish.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.497
- Fish coming out now.
- Come on, y'all, let's get it!

18:51.530 --> 18:53.432
Man:
Sandwich was okay,

18:53.465 --> 18:55.534
but I only got a little tiny
piece of chicken like that big.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.336
I couldn't even taste
the inside of that.

18:57.369 --> 18:59.305
Onion rings, onion rings,
onion rings.

18:59.338 --> 19:01.507
Let's keep going, guys.
Let's keep working.

19:01.540 --> 19:03.309
- Okay, it's cooked.
It's cooked.
- Good.

19:03.342 --> 19:05.211
Okay, it's not a celebration.
Let's go.

19:05.244 --> 19:07.546
I really taste the beer
in the fish.

19:07.579 --> 19:10.149
My money's definitely going
with red.

19:10.182 --> 19:12.551
In this group of four, we have
two votes for the red team,

19:12.584 --> 19:14.553
and two votes for the blue team.

19:14.586 --> 19:16.388
Ralph:
We're not done, guys.
We gotta finish this strong.

19:16.422 --> 19:19.658
- Let's go!
- I was not a fan
of the sandwich,

19:19.692 --> 19:21.460
just because
I had two tops

19:21.493 --> 19:23.395
on my sandwich,
and I think...

19:23.429 --> 19:24.997
- Double the tops.
- ...that quality control
was missing.

19:25.031 --> 19:27.366
Quality control?
Wow, that's unbelievable.

19:27.399 --> 19:29.736
- That would be a bad thing.
- Bad mistake.

19:29.769 --> 19:31.904
Lindsay:
Chicken sandwich is
coming up.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.572
Thank you for your patience.

19:33.605 --> 19:36.075
Keep pushing till the end.
Keep pushing till the end.

19:41.380 --> 19:43.415
Thank you! Enjoy.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.417
- Guys, I think that's it.
- Yeah.

19:45.451 --> 19:46.986
We had, you know,
a rough start,

19:47.019 --> 19:48.721
and a rocky middle,

19:48.755 --> 19:52.391
and we worked so hard to serve
as fast as we could,

19:52.424 --> 19:54.026
but I'm not feeling the best

19:54.060 --> 19:55.895
because I know
at the end of the day,

19:55.928 --> 19:58.530
not all 101 brewers were able
to taste our dish.

19:58.564 --> 20:01.200
All:
One, two, three, red team!

20:01.233 --> 20:02.935
- Sorry for the wait, y'all.
- Sorry about the wait.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.536
- Enjoy.
- Sorry about the wait.

20:04.570 --> 20:07.073
Alecia: I'm really proud
of the blue team

20:07.106 --> 20:08.875
just because we did serve 101

20:08.908 --> 20:10.442
men and women.

20:10.476 --> 20:12.178
So now it's just time to pray

20:12.211 --> 20:14.113
that everyone
gives us the money.

20:14.146 --> 20:16.282
All:
Blue team!

20:19.285 --> 20:20.586
( cheers and applause )

20:20.619 --> 20:23.122
Thank you.

20:24.456 --> 20:26.225
Let's go, guys.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.396
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you

20:30.429 --> 20:32.331
on behalf of everybody here
at "MasterChef."

20:34.066 --> 20:36.102
Both teams fought
very hard today

20:36.135 --> 20:40.472
to provide you with not just
one, but two delicious lunches.

20:42.441 --> 20:46.245
Only one team can be safe
from elimination.

20:48.447 --> 20:50.249
Bowen:
I'm so nervous.

20:50.282 --> 20:51.984
I'm going to cry,

20:52.018 --> 20:53.485
because I don't want
to lead my team

20:53.519 --> 20:55.354
to go to the ( bleep )
pressure test.

20:56.488 --> 20:58.590
That team is...

20:58.624 --> 21:00.927
Chelsea:
Oh, my God, please, please,
please be the blue team.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.261
Please be the blue team.

21:02.294 --> 21:04.363
Congratulations...

21:09.635 --> 21:12.238
( whistle blowing )

21:12.271 --> 21:14.640
- ...red team!
- ( cheering )

21:20.046 --> 21:22.114
We won! Yeah!
Go, red team!

21:22.148 --> 21:24.283
( cheering )

21:24.316 --> 21:27.019
Congratulations! Go celebrate
with our amazing guests.

21:27.053 --> 21:28.320
( all cheering )

21:28.354 --> 21:32.291
- Thank you, thank you.
- Thank you guys.

21:32.324 --> 21:34.961
Blue team,
you know what that means.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.763
But first I want all of you
to go back there

21:37.796 --> 21:39.798
and get both those
kitchens cleaned.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.800
- Now! Let's go!
- Yes, Chef.

21:43.836 --> 21:46.172
Farhan:
I can't say I'm surprised,

21:46.205 --> 21:47.706
but I'm honestly just
disappointed

21:47.739 --> 21:49.475
at our lack of communication
and teamwork.

21:49.508 --> 21:51.777
There's always
the pressure test, right?

21:51.810 --> 21:53.612
Yep. Do you best
in the pressure test

21:53.645 --> 21:54.881
and we'll find
the weakest one.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.049
We shall find
the weakest one.

22:08.394 --> 22:09.862
Gordon:
Come on down, guys, please.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.497
Chelsea:
Walking into this pressure test

22:11.530 --> 22:14.000
I feel beaten to a pulp,
to be honest.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.067
Gordon:
Line up.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.735
I was team captain.

22:16.768 --> 22:18.404
I feel like everyone
is blaming me

22:18.437 --> 22:20.572
even though I've never been put
in that position before.

22:20.606 --> 22:22.308
I hate making decisions,

22:22.341 --> 22:25.077
and I just want being captain
to be over with.

22:27.346 --> 22:31.250
You are all about to face your
first dreaded pressure test.

22:31.283 --> 22:35.821
And at least one of you
will be going home.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.925
Okay, there are ten of you
standing in front of us,

22:38.958 --> 22:42.929
but not all of you are gonna
have to face this pressure test.

22:42.962 --> 22:46.298
Just seven of you are.

22:47.533 --> 22:51.170
That decision will be made by...

22:51.203 --> 22:53.372
you, Chelsea.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.408
- Right now, one person.
- Yeah.

22:56.442 --> 22:59.011
Because at the beginning
when I asked this person
to do something,

22:59.045 --> 23:00.746
they did it.
They didn't bother me.

23:00.779 --> 23:02.048
I'm saving Cesar.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.549
- Cesar?
- Yeah.

23:03.582 --> 23:05.784
Okay. You are safe,
head up to the balcony,

23:05.817 --> 23:07.920
- and take off that black apron.
- Thank you.

23:07.954 --> 23:09.922
Chelsea:
My mentality is to save those

23:09.956 --> 23:12.191
that actually did
what I asked them to do

23:12.224 --> 23:13.692
even if I saw them struggling,

23:13.725 --> 23:15.194
'cause everyone else was
screaming at me.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.696
Chelsea, there are two more
saves left.

23:17.729 --> 23:22.468
This individual kept my spirits
up, so I'm saving Alecia.

23:22.501 --> 23:24.270
- Alecia, you're safe.
Please go up in the balcony.
- Thank you.

23:24.303 --> 23:25.871
Thank you.

23:25.904 --> 23:28.607
( whispering )
Thank you, Jesus!

23:28.640 --> 23:31.077
- I don't think that
that decision was fair.
- It's hard to decide.

23:31.110 --> 23:33.445
I mean, I wish
I could save everybody.

23:33.479 --> 23:36.648
Gordon: Right. Chelsea,
one more decision left.

23:36.682 --> 23:38.550
( sighs )
I don't even know. Um...

23:38.584 --> 23:41.153
- You don't even know?
- Chelsea: Hold on.

23:41.187 --> 23:45.091
- I'm going to save Juni.
- Shanika: Oh, my God!

23:45.124 --> 23:46.658
There are at least
two other individuals here

23:46.692 --> 23:48.560
that worked their ass off.

23:48.594 --> 23:51.397
Other people literally
did not do anything
that I asked them to do.

23:51.430 --> 23:54.833
- Gordon: Right. Juni, whisk
yourself up to the balcony.
- Thank you.

23:57.369 --> 23:59.571
So, Chelsea,
you made your decisions.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.974
Sorry, guys.

24:03.009 --> 24:05.611
In this pressure test...

24:05.644 --> 24:08.547
you'll be baking...

24:10.716 --> 24:12.951
banana cream pie.

24:16.388 --> 24:21.160
A glorious combination
of a flaky pie crust

24:21.193 --> 24:26.465
of custard, caramelized bananas,
and fresh whipped cream.

24:26.498 --> 24:27.799
( whispering )
Wow!

24:27.833 --> 24:31.270
This is a perfect
banana cream pie,

24:31.303 --> 24:33.939
and this is exactly
what we are looking for.

24:33.972 --> 24:36.308
Now, all of you please,
head to your stations.

24:36.342 --> 24:38.044
Let's go.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.812
Shanika: First of all,
my team captain, Chelsea,

24:40.846 --> 24:42.348
you're the reason
why we're here.

24:42.381 --> 24:45.051
And then on top of that,
saving people

24:45.084 --> 24:46.485
because they're nice to you?

24:46.518 --> 24:48.454
It is so not fair.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.489
You should've saved the people
that worked hardest.

24:50.522 --> 24:51.890
I should not have
to be down here

24:51.923 --> 24:53.625
baking this damn pie right now.

24:53.659 --> 24:56.328
At your stations, you'll find
everything that you need

24:56.362 --> 24:59.365
to make a beautiful
banana cream pie.

24:59.398 --> 25:02.068
Joe:
You have 60 minutes to give us

25:02.101 --> 25:04.570
the best banana cream pie

25:04.603 --> 25:06.238
that we have ever tasted.

25:06.272 --> 25:08.374
- Is everyone ready?
- All: Yes, sir.

25:08.407 --> 25:10.042
Your time starts...

25:10.942 --> 25:11.943
now.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.582
( bleep )!

25:16.615 --> 25:18.417
- Hmm.
- You got it, girl.

25:18.450 --> 25:20.018
She'll be fine.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.054
I make my boyfriend banana
pudding all of the time.

25:22.088 --> 25:24.390
I have no problem making
a banana cream pie.

25:24.423 --> 25:25.757
I just hate so many
people hate me.

25:25.791 --> 25:27.259
( chuckles )
I'm not used to that.

25:29.895 --> 25:31.597
- Get it, Farhan!
- Thank you, sir.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.165
Gerron:
I see you, Lindsay.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.000
I don't tend to do
a lot of baking.

25:35.033 --> 25:37.836
My wife and I stay away
from sweets a little bit,

25:37.869 --> 25:39.705
but I did knowing I was coming
to "MasterChef."

25:39.738 --> 25:42.040
Spent a bit of time on areas
that I was uncomfortable with,

25:42.074 --> 25:43.542
pies being one of them.

25:43.575 --> 25:45.544
I'm representing Chef Ramsay,

25:45.577 --> 25:47.613
and I've never made a banana
cream pie before.

25:47.646 --> 25:50.449
Looking good, Taylor.
Looking good.

25:50.482 --> 25:53.185
I'm a little nervous,
but I am from Houston,

25:53.219 --> 25:55.521
so, I can bake.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.856
I have a good enough base to--
to kill it.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.425
Guys, banana cream pie.

25:59.458 --> 26:01.560
Gerron:
Looking good, Em.
Looking good.

26:01.593 --> 26:04.730
Gordon:
First off is the crust.
Butter, flour, buttermilk.

26:04.763 --> 26:06.532
Once it's rested
we start rolling it,

26:06.565 --> 26:08.767
and then line that pie crust
in that dish.

26:08.800 --> 26:11.270
- Good job, Chels.
- You gotta get that made

26:11.303 --> 26:12.871
within the first eight
to ten minutes.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.906
Why? 'Cause it needs to rest
in the glass chiller

26:14.940 --> 26:17.042
for at least five minutes
so it firms up.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.777
- And then you blind bake it.
- AarÃ³n: Mm-hmm.

26:18.810 --> 26:20.612
That is the base.
And then from there,

26:20.646 --> 26:22.248
you start making
three quarter whip,

26:22.281 --> 26:24.583
and you paste your cream.
Powdered sugar in there,

26:24.616 --> 26:27.753
vanilla bean, and do not
over-whip that cream on top.

26:27.786 --> 26:29.321
- AarÃ³n: Absolutely.
- Gordon: It's a tough one.

26:29.355 --> 26:31.757
My arm is sore.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.725
AarÃ³n:
All right, guys, 40 minutes.

26:33.759 --> 26:36.428
Make sure you're tempering
that cream even and smooth.

26:36.462 --> 26:39.298
Crust should be resting
in the fridge.

26:39.331 --> 26:42.000
Somehow Darrick does not
have a pie crust yet.

26:42.033 --> 26:44.603
Gordon: Right.
Banana cream pie.

26:44.636 --> 26:45.971
Darrick, how are you
gonna nail this?

26:46.004 --> 26:49.107
I am going to nail
the pie crust to start.

26:49.141 --> 26:51.910
My family, we actually have
our own recipe for pie crust.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.513
So, I'm not going home today.

26:54.546 --> 26:55.947
Good. Get that set
in the fridge.

26:55.981 --> 26:57.449
- Good.
- Thank you, Chef.

26:57.483 --> 26:59.485
Halfway, guys. Come on,
let's go. Focus.

26:59.518 --> 27:01.353
- Hello, Emily.
- Hello, Joe.

27:01.387 --> 27:04.190
You're down here
in the pressure test
wearing my apron.

27:04.223 --> 27:05.691
- What are you doing here?
- I'm sorry. You know what?

27:05.724 --> 27:07.426
There's a lot of variables
you can't control.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.627
That pie crust looks good.
All right, are you a baker?

27:08.660 --> 27:09.995
I am a baker, actually.

27:10.028 --> 27:11.630
I make pies all the time
at home in Wisconsin.

27:11.663 --> 27:13.265
So I think I have a leg up
on some of the people here.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.933
I'm getting this in the oven
and make sure

27:14.966 --> 27:16.168
that my pastry cream
is perfect,

27:16.202 --> 27:17.503
and then slice
and brÃ»lÃ©e my bananas.

27:17.536 --> 27:19.205
- Thank you. Good luck.
- Thank you. Thanks!

27:22.674 --> 27:24.310
You whippin', Farhan.
You whippin'.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.612
You know how I do it.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.347
- Farhan.
You've got my apron on.
- Yes, Chef?

27:28.380 --> 27:29.881
- Yes, Chef.
- Are you a baker?

27:29.915 --> 27:31.350
I am not a baker at all.

27:31.383 --> 27:32.984
The closest I get to baking
is helping my dad

27:33.018 --> 27:34.353
make little Indian
sweets at home.

27:34.386 --> 27:35.787
Now what potentially
can go wrong?

27:35.821 --> 27:38.624
I think this is really
a test of time management.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.292
Luckily as a dental student,
I have a lot of time management.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.528
Right.
Are you tasting?

27:42.561 --> 27:44.396
Just 'cause it's pastry doesn't
mean you can't taste, buddy.

27:44.430 --> 27:45.797
- No, no.
- You gotta see the evolution.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.533
- Come on. All right.
- Yes, Chef.

27:52.003 --> 27:54.640
Just over 20 minutes left.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.208
- Flavor's good.
- Shanika.

27:56.242 --> 27:57.909
- Yes, sir.
- You're wearing my apron.

27:57.943 --> 27:59.678
Situations that were out
of your control put you here.

27:59.711 --> 28:01.847
- Really.
- ( chuckles )

28:01.880 --> 28:05.817
- What does that feel like?
- Everybody is not meant
to be leaders

28:05.851 --> 28:08.053
- and yesterday
showed just that.
- Yeah, of course.

28:08.086 --> 28:09.988
That's why I'm down here
cooking, too.

28:10.021 --> 28:11.657
She should've just took
that bullet for the whole team.

28:11.690 --> 28:13.592
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

28:13.625 --> 28:16.094
I ain't going nowhere,
Chelsea.

28:16.127 --> 28:18.864
And after today,
you're gonna learn, sister.

28:18.897 --> 28:21.400
Let your success make
the noise, Chelsea.

28:21.433 --> 28:23.369
- Block everything out,
you don't have to listen.
- You and your little minion.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.271
- You know you got this.
- You and your little minion.

28:25.304 --> 28:26.905
You got it, girl.
In the bag.

28:26.938 --> 28:29.608
- You got it in the bag.
- Shanika: You wish, girl.

28:32.611 --> 28:34.613
- Huh?
- I'm not tough enough for this.

28:34.646 --> 28:36.382
I'm betting y'all that.

28:36.415 --> 28:38.350
Chelsea,
I'm calling you out, sis.

28:38.384 --> 28:42.954
I'm only wanting one person to
go home today, and that is you.

28:44.556 --> 28:46.792
Joe: AarÃ³n, I think
you might lose her tonight.

28:46.825 --> 28:48.927
- What is she doing?
- It's hard to even be in here
right now.

28:48.960 --> 28:50.696
( chuckles )

28:50.729 --> 28:52.298
Bye, Felicia.

28:57.503 --> 28:59.471
Gordon:
Just over 15 minutes remaining.

28:59.505 --> 29:01.540
( sniffling )

29:01.573 --> 29:03.375
It's hard to even be in here
right now.

29:03.409 --> 29:05.577
Joe: AarÃ³n, I think
you might lose her tonight.

29:05.611 --> 29:07.045
- What is she doing?
- All these tough decisions

29:07.078 --> 29:09.315
have really gotten
to her constitution.

29:09.348 --> 29:10.949
- Gordon: Oh, dear.
- All right, Chels.

29:10.982 --> 29:12.451
( crying )
I gotta keep going.

29:12.484 --> 29:15.287
Right, young lady.

29:15.321 --> 29:17.956
You know, being a captain
is a tough role.

29:17.989 --> 29:20.826
I'm not used to people
disliking me.

29:20.859 --> 29:22.961
Gordon:
All right, listen,
don't beat yourself up.

29:22.994 --> 29:24.496
Okay?
It is what it is.

29:24.530 --> 29:26.097
You're a talented,
talented girl.

29:26.131 --> 29:27.566
Now, dust yourself down.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.000
- You can do this. Yeah?
- Okay.

29:29.034 --> 29:30.769
- Come on.
- Yes, Chef.

29:30.802 --> 29:33.805
You can do this
in your sleep, girl.
You got it.

29:33.839 --> 29:36.442
- There you go, Chelsea.
- Good job, Chelsea.

29:36.475 --> 29:39.077
Chelsea.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.579
Gordon:
Last ten minutes, guys.

29:40.612 --> 29:41.980
Pie crust should
be cooling down.

29:42.013 --> 29:45.451
You should start to assemble
your banana pie.

29:45.484 --> 29:47.018
Looks like I need
more cream in here.

29:47.052 --> 29:49.455
Shanika, her cream is
overwhipped,

29:49.488 --> 29:51.490
and all she did was add more
cream to it.

29:51.523 --> 29:55.461
- Big mistake.
- Shanika is angry at Chelsea.

29:55.494 --> 29:56.995
I wonder if that anger
will affect her ability

29:57.028 --> 29:59.164
to create a pie
that could save her.

29:59.197 --> 30:01.933
AarÃ³n:
And Farhan is not
a baker at all.

30:01.967 --> 30:04.703
We could potentially
be losing one of the best
savory cooks in him.

30:04.736 --> 30:06.338
Joe:
That would be
a major loss for you.

30:06.372 --> 30:08.507
Think about height.

30:08.540 --> 30:09.975
Joe:
If you don't have the height,
it looks like soup in a bowl.

30:12.744 --> 30:15.514
Gordon:
Last two minutes.

30:15.547 --> 30:19.184
Finishing touches, let's go!
Darrick, come on.

30:19.217 --> 30:21.152
Mark:
His vanilla is
not in there.

30:21.186 --> 30:23.221
His vanilla is
on his eggs.

30:23.254 --> 30:25.123
60 seconds remaining,

30:25.156 --> 30:27.058
and for one of you,
your last time cooking

30:27.092 --> 30:28.894
inside the MasterChef kitchen.

30:28.927 --> 30:30.829
( whispering )
Oh, my God, put your
bananas on top.

30:30.862 --> 30:33.164
( singsong )
I'm scared for these
people right now.

30:33.198 --> 30:34.733
I'm scared for these people.

30:34.766 --> 30:35.867
- Come on, guys!
- There we go.

30:35.901 --> 30:37.536
30 seconds remaining!

30:38.837 --> 30:41.306
- Good.
- Come on, Tay!

30:41.339 --> 30:44.576
Smooth up that cream, put the
bananas on with seconds to go.

30:44.610 --> 30:49.581
Judges:
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

30:49.615 --> 30:53.652
five, four, three, two, one.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.421
And stop.
Hands in the air.

30:57.623 --> 30:59.591
Gordon:
Well done.

30:59.625 --> 31:01.192
Now, all of you very carefully,

31:01.226 --> 31:03.929
bring those pies down
to the front. Thank you.

31:03.962 --> 31:07.065
Emily:
My first pressure test,
it's a baking challenge.

31:07.098 --> 31:08.867
This is not something
that comes easily

31:08.900 --> 31:10.268
to a lot of home cooks,

31:10.301 --> 31:11.670
but with the amount
of knowledge

31:11.703 --> 31:13.271
and skill that I possess,

31:13.304 --> 31:14.840
it kind of felt
like a cakewalk.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.108
And, honestly,
looking around, I think

31:17.142 --> 31:19.077
that there are quite a few
other competitors

31:19.110 --> 31:21.346
whose pies are just
not up to snuff.

31:21.379 --> 31:24.382
Let's begin with team captain,
Chelsea.

31:24.416 --> 31:27.753
Chelsea.

31:27.786 --> 31:30.021
Flavor, consistency?
What am I looking for?

31:30.055 --> 31:32.390
Give me a tour
of your pie.

31:32.424 --> 31:34.392
The bottom layer
should be very evenly
coated with bananas.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.361
The pastry cream is
very smooth,

31:36.394 --> 31:38.029
and then I think
I did a really good job
on the whipped cream as well.

31:38.063 --> 31:40.932
Moment of truth.

31:40.966 --> 31:42.468
Ooh!

31:42.501 --> 31:44.135
It holds its form.

31:46.271 --> 31:47.906
So it's about even parts
pastry cream and whipped cream.

31:47.939 --> 31:50.776
Mm-hmm.
I made sure it wasn't
too, too sweet.

31:50.809 --> 31:53.411
It's light.
It's flavorful.

31:53.445 --> 31:55.681
Flaky crust, looks like
it's properly cooked.

31:57.683 --> 32:00.085
You know, aesthetics
are important in baking.

32:00.118 --> 32:02.888
I look down the line,
I see some pretty
good examples.

32:02.921 --> 32:04.389
Tough night for you,
Chelsea, right?

32:04.422 --> 32:05.757
Being a captain,
making difficult decisions.

32:05.791 --> 32:07.626
Maybe you made some friends,

32:07.659 --> 32:09.795
maybe you made some enemies.

32:09.828 --> 32:12.363
Maybe you made a pie
that could keep you here.

32:14.099 --> 32:15.634
Maybe you didn't.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.472
- Emily.
- Chef.

32:20.506 --> 32:22.608
Wow.
I mean, visually,

32:22.641 --> 32:24.510
I gotta say it's striking.
It's textbook.

32:24.543 --> 32:26.311
It's like this beautiful
little dome on the outside.

32:26.344 --> 32:28.847
I think you caramelized
those bananas beautifully.

32:28.880 --> 32:30.849
-
They're thin.
They're consistent in cut.
- Thank you, Chef.

32:30.882 --> 32:32.784
So what should I be looking
for when I cut this open?

32:32.818 --> 32:35.120
For a perfectly set
crÃ¨me patissiere,

32:35.153 --> 32:36.488
a nice stiff-peak
whipped cream,

32:36.522 --> 32:38.089
thin layer of bananas
on the bottom

32:38.123 --> 32:39.324
and a perfectly-cooked crust.

32:41.392 --> 32:42.794
- Nice.
- That's spot on.

32:42.828 --> 32:44.630
I can see all the specks
of the vanilla

32:44.663 --> 32:46.331
in the cream,
which I think is important.

32:48.967 --> 32:52.203
Man, the flavor delivers.
The cream is not too sweet,

32:52.237 --> 32:54.973
which I'm so happy about.
You're wearing Joe's apron.

32:55.006 --> 32:58.677
To be honest, Joe, I think,
is doing a great job with you,

32:58.710 --> 33:00.178
in the truest of ways.

33:00.211 --> 33:02.180
Of course, I could do
a better job with you,

33:02.213 --> 33:06.518
but I can't find anything
bad to say about this.

33:06.552 --> 33:07.686
Thank you, Chef.

33:07.719 --> 33:10.522
And that doesn't happen often.

33:10.556 --> 33:12.290
( whispers )
Nice work.

33:12.323 --> 33:16.562
Farhan, right, young man.
Mentored by AarÃ³n.

33:16.595 --> 33:17.563
Describe the pie.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.865
So, banana cream pie.

33:19.898 --> 33:22.534
I think I should've domed
the cream a little bit more,
aesthetically--

33:22.568 --> 33:26.037
So let's start that again.
A flat banana cream pie.

33:26.071 --> 33:27.372
- Yes, Chef.
- But what worries me

33:27.405 --> 33:28.574
more than anything
is this bit here.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.341
It's wobbly.

33:30.375 --> 33:32.578
Have you made
the cream firm enough?

33:32.611 --> 33:34.680
I think the cream might be
a little soft, Chef.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.214
Let's get in there,
shall we?

33:38.717 --> 33:40.385
Whipped cream
on the soft side.

33:40.418 --> 33:41.720
That's weighing that down,
as you can see.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.354
- Yes, Chef.
- Minutes from now,

33:43.388 --> 33:45.523
that thing's gonna be
requiring a straw to eat it.

33:45.557 --> 33:47.559
- Do you bake at home?
- I do not.

33:47.593 --> 33:49.160
My mom is
an incredible baker.

33:49.194 --> 33:51.396
I've see her work some magic
in the kitchen,

33:51.429 --> 33:53.198
but pastry really
scares me in a way.

33:53.231 --> 33:54.365
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:54.399 --> 33:56.067
Let me whisper something
in your ear.

33:56.101 --> 33:57.903
You'll never become
America's next MasterChef

33:57.936 --> 33:59.070
if you can't bake.

33:59.104 --> 34:01.339
- Yes, Chef.
- Not your best effort.

34:01.372 --> 34:02.941
It's a pressure test.

34:02.974 --> 34:04.876
Let's hope you haven't
cracked under it.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.680
- Taylor.
- Hi, Chef.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.281
You've got Gordon's apron.

34:10.315 --> 34:12.283
Yes.

34:12.317 --> 34:14.185
Do you feel like this pie is
going to do him justice?

34:14.219 --> 34:15.921
I sure hope so.

34:17.488 --> 34:19.424
You happy with the balance
of flavor in here?

34:19.457 --> 34:20.759
Absolutely.

34:25.430 --> 34:27.899
Here's the deal.

34:27.933 --> 34:29.267
The flavor is unreal.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.736
Thank you, Chef.

34:30.769 --> 34:33.438
You did a great job
with the pastry cream,

34:33.471 --> 34:35.874
putting the aeration
and working those egg yolks.

34:35.907 --> 34:37.709
Whipped cream
is fluffy and airy as well.

34:37.743 --> 34:41.112
What could I do better?
The crust. It's clunky.

34:41.146 --> 34:42.748
But other than that,
I think you're
in a good place.

34:42.781 --> 34:44.015
- Thank you, Chef.
- All right.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.788
All right, Lindsay.

34:49.821 --> 34:52.557
The bananas look like--
some of them look dry.

34:52.590 --> 34:54.159
Did you not get
to glaze all of them?

34:54.192 --> 34:56.094
- What happened there?
- They could've had more time--

34:56.127 --> 34:58.096
A little bit
more glazing, yeah.

34:58.129 --> 35:00.065
It's all about
the details, Lindsay.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.167
You know,
you're an attorney.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.102
Details count.

35:04.135 --> 35:06.938
The ratio of
custard to cream's
like half and half?

35:06.972 --> 35:09.941
- It's where I didn't
want it to be.
- How's your crust?

35:09.975 --> 35:12.678
- It's pretty good. It's flaky.
- It's flaky.
I didn't overwork the dough.

35:16.648 --> 35:18.116
A little on the salty side.

35:21.052 --> 35:23.121
Oh. Altogether,
it makes sense..

35:23.154 --> 35:25.123
It's light.
It's flavorful.

35:25.156 --> 35:27.993
It's not Emily's level,
but it's not bad.

35:28.026 --> 35:29.027
Thank you, Joe.

35:31.997 --> 35:34.199
- Shanika.
- Hi, Chef.

35:34.232 --> 35:35.701
You happy with the way
everything was cooked?

35:35.734 --> 35:38.937
I'm happy with the cook
on the crust,

35:38.970 --> 35:42.207
but I guess a little anger
got in me.

35:42.240 --> 35:45.310
So I think I may have
overwhipped the cream.

35:45.343 --> 35:46.712
Yeah, the whipped cream
ain't right.

35:46.745 --> 35:48.646
Yes, Chef.

35:48.680 --> 35:52.884
But other than that, I feel
that the flavors are there.

35:52.918 --> 35:55.553
I think that crust
is really delicious,

35:55.586 --> 35:57.856
but here's just what I find
a little confusing.

35:57.889 --> 35:59.624
Okay.

35:59.657 --> 36:01.159
You've got two big elements,

36:01.192 --> 36:03.628
the cream
and the pastry cream,

36:03.661 --> 36:06.965
that are very difficult
for me to distinguish.

36:06.998 --> 36:09.534
The textures, and I think
you can see it, are the same.

36:09.567 --> 36:11.136
Because of the overwhipping
of the cream.

36:11.169 --> 36:12.403
That's a problem.

36:15.774 --> 36:18.309
Darrick, you make these pies
all the time, right?

36:18.343 --> 36:23.381
Not these pies, Chef,
but my family has a pie crust
recipe that we use.

36:23.414 --> 36:25.516
So it's not gonna win
a beauty contest, is it?

36:25.550 --> 36:28.019
- No, sir.
- Okay.

36:28.053 --> 36:29.687
As always,
it's in the flavor, right?

36:29.721 --> 36:31.156
Vanilla bean in there?

36:31.189 --> 36:33.258
Uh, no, sir, I did not
add vanilla bean.

36:33.291 --> 36:35.761
- That is something I forgot.
- Darrick! Why not?

36:35.794 --> 36:38.830
- I-- first time making...
- Just a mouthful of sugar.

36:38.864 --> 36:40.932
...whipped cream, Chef.

36:40.966 --> 36:42.600
( stammers )
It's--

36:44.635 --> 36:47.405
It's the first time
you've whipped cream.

36:47.438 --> 36:49.207
- Yes, Chef.
- You're entering

36:49.240 --> 36:51.042
the biggest cooking
competition in the world,

36:51.076 --> 36:52.343
and you've never whipped cream.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.780
I don't like whipped cream,
Chef, so--

36:54.813 --> 36:58.349
- Oh, it's all about
what you don't or do like.
- No, Chef. No, Chef.

36:58.383 --> 37:00.118
Why did you come here?

37:00.151 --> 37:04.022
I wanted to learn to become
a better chef.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.957
You bust your balls
before you come in.

37:05.991 --> 37:08.293
Did anyone practice
before they came to
this competition?

37:08.326 --> 37:10.261
Contestants:
Yes, Chef.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.330
Did anybody else not practice
before they came?

37:25.510 --> 37:28.279
That was a hard-fought,
extremely difficult pressure
test, no?

37:28.313 --> 37:29.881
- Woman: Yes, Chef.
- Yes, Chef.

37:29.915 --> 37:32.150
Please, everyone,
come around front.

37:32.183 --> 37:34.719
Darrick:
Unfortunately,
I let Chef Ramsay down.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.121
I feel like I failed him.

37:36.154 --> 37:37.789
Gordon: So there's three
in the bottom.

37:37.823 --> 37:40.225
AarÃ³n: To think a pie
would trip so many people up.

37:40.258 --> 37:42.293
Right now, I'm just hoping
that I get another opportunity

37:42.327 --> 37:43.995
to prove myself
in this kitchen.

37:44.029 --> 37:45.630
I'm hoping that someone's
made a dish

37:45.663 --> 37:47.098
more egregious than mine.

37:47.132 --> 37:48.566
- Joe: Got it?
- AarÃ³n: Yep.

37:48.599 --> 37:49.600
Right.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.075
It's been a pretty tough night
in the MasterChef kitchen,

37:57.108 --> 37:59.878
and at least one of you
will be leaving tonight.

38:02.713 --> 38:05.817
But first,
there was one home cook

38:05.851 --> 38:08.319
that made
a banana cream pie

38:08.353 --> 38:10.255
as good as the one
we showed you.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.622
Emily, who was that?

38:11.656 --> 38:13.458
Me.

38:13.491 --> 38:16.127
You are absolutely right.

38:16.161 --> 38:17.929
You made me proud.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.298
Go up to the balcony.
Take your apron off.

38:20.331 --> 38:22.300
You're safe and enjoy it.
Good job.

38:22.333 --> 38:24.002
- Thank you, Chef.
- ( applause )

38:24.035 --> 38:25.871
Emily: I am from Wisconsin.
I lived in New Orleans.

38:25.904 --> 38:27.505
My grandma's
from North Carolina,

38:27.538 --> 38:30.608
so I know my way around
a pie for sure.

38:30.641 --> 38:32.710
I could beat this almost
with my eyes closed.

38:34.679 --> 38:36.281
So there's
six home cooks left.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.816
If I say your name,
please step forward.

38:40.085 --> 38:42.487
Lindsay.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.455
Taylor.

38:44.489 --> 38:46.324
And Chelsea.

38:48.994 --> 38:51.729
Please, all of you, take off
your aprons and head up
to the balcony.

38:51.762 --> 38:53.865
- Well done.
- Thank you, Chef.

38:53.899 --> 38:55.566
Those steps.
( chuckles )

38:55.600 --> 38:57.903
I love those steps.

38:57.936 --> 39:00.505
I mean, when you're down
in that pressure test,
it's scary,

39:00.538 --> 39:04.142
but now I have one more cook
in this kitchen

39:04.175 --> 39:06.144
than everyone up
on the balcony,

39:06.177 --> 39:09.014
and that makes me
stronger in itself.

39:09.047 --> 39:10.015
Gordon:
Right.

39:10.048 --> 39:12.350
Farhan, Shanika,
and Darrick.

39:12.383 --> 39:16.354
All three of us have a stake in
this decision this evening.

39:16.387 --> 39:19.557
One judge will lose
a talented home cook.

39:21.392 --> 39:24.029
Tonight
there was one home cook

39:24.062 --> 39:26.764
that has shown they are
a little bit flustered,

39:26.797 --> 39:29.634
a little bit underprepared.

39:31.802 --> 39:33.438
I'd like that person

39:33.471 --> 39:37.208
to keep their integrity intact,

39:37.242 --> 39:38.543
untie their apron...

39:40.111 --> 39:42.213
and they know
who I'm talking about.

39:50.488 --> 39:51.789
Oh, Darrick.

39:54.159 --> 39:56.361
You came in...

39:56.394 --> 39:58.529
a thousand miles an hour.

39:58.563 --> 40:01.099
Unfortunately, young man,
you've just run out of steam.

40:01.132 --> 40:03.534
Continue cooking
and good luck.

40:03.568 --> 40:04.635
Thank you, Chef.

40:04.669 --> 40:06.437
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:06.471 --> 40:08.606
- Did a good job.
- Thank you, sir.

40:08.639 --> 40:09.874
- Good luck, Darrick.
- Thank you.

40:09.907 --> 40:11.042
Woman:
Good job, Darrick.

40:11.076 --> 40:13.611
( applause )

40:13.644 --> 40:17.615
I used to think I didn't have
a single shred of creativity

40:17.648 --> 40:19.384
in my body.

40:19.417 --> 40:21.886
And then I found my passion,
my love in cooking.

40:21.919 --> 40:25.256
I'm going home,
but I made it to the top
frickin' 20.

40:25.290 --> 40:27.892
I'm not done cooking yet.

40:27.925 --> 40:29.527
We're only getting started.

40:32.430 --> 40:34.165
- Shanika.
- Yes, Chef.

40:34.199 --> 40:35.566
Head on upstairs.

40:35.600 --> 40:38.303
Shanika:
Whoo! Safe from elimination.

40:38.336 --> 40:40.171
This competition is getting
serious now.

40:40.205 --> 40:43.841
- Farhan. Head on upstairs.
- Yes, Chef.

40:43.874 --> 40:46.611
Oh, my Lord.
Oh, thank you.

40:46.644 --> 40:47.979
Gordon has five aprons.

40:48.013 --> 40:50.181
AarÃ³n still has eight aprons.

40:50.215 --> 40:52.450
And Team Joe, we got six,

40:52.483 --> 40:54.152
but these numbers are dropping.

40:54.185 --> 40:56.687
So whatever happens,

40:56.721 --> 40:58.923
I have to give 100%

40:58.956 --> 41:00.091
because if I don't,

41:00.125 --> 41:02.627
I'm going home.

41:02.660 --> 41:04.462
Good job.

41:04.495 --> 41:06.431
Guys, however tough that was,

41:06.464 --> 41:08.033
stay focused, stay sharp.

41:08.066 --> 41:11.769
This competition gets
more and more intense.

41:11.802 --> 41:13.971
See you next time.
Good night.

41:17.408 --> 41:18.476
Narrator:
Next time...

41:18.509 --> 41:20.311
Keep your fingers out of there.

41:20.345 --> 41:23.648
The top 19 face
a mystery box...

41:23.681 --> 41:25.550
- ( gasps )
- Oh, my God.

41:25.583 --> 41:27.385
...that's tough to crack.

41:27.418 --> 41:28.786
Woman:
I don't know what to do.

41:28.819 --> 41:30.688
I do not know how to cook
with them.

41:30.721 --> 41:32.057
And then...

41:32.090 --> 41:33.524
Please welcome

41:33.558 --> 41:35.326
one of America's greatest
soccer players.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.195
Alexi Lalas?
Are we playing soccer

41:37.228 --> 41:38.963
or are we cooking over here?

41:38.996 --> 41:40.965
- A world-class challenge...
- Woman: Oh, my God.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.201
- ...with an end...
- What happened?

41:43.234 --> 41:44.702
...no one will see coming.

41:44.735 --> 41:46.171
Are you done?
