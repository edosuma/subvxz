a piece of it?

54:51.766 --> 54:53.638
You know, my mother was kind
of like that too.

54:53.681 --> 54:57.032
She never ran out of patience,
especially with me.

54:57.598 --> 54:58.469
CLAIRE: Wow.

55:01.646 --> 55:04.475
My mom had a nine to five job
that she hated.

55:04.518 --> 55:06.999
But she painted on the side.

55:07.042 --> 55:08.827
That's how she came here
actually.

55:10.176 --> 55:13.179
Her sketch group would take
a trip once a year

55:13.222 --> 55:14.746
and do nothing but paint.

55:16.269 --> 55:18.271
And they rented these cottages
over Christmas break.

55:19.577 --> 55:22.623
ANDREW: So that's how that
painting happened.

55:22.667 --> 55:26.061
CLAIRE: Yup, and she came home
and just quit her job

55:26.105 --> 55:28.890
and started painting full-time.

55:28.934 --> 55:30.675
She would always tell me
that Glastenbury

55:30.718 --> 55:32.938
was this magical place

55:32.981 --> 55:34.374
where dreams came true.

55:36.071 --> 55:38.073
ANDREW: We should put that on a
billboard at the Train Depot.

55:40.685 --> 55:42.339
CLAIRE: She was always gonna
take me here.

55:43.992 --> 55:45.037
It was kind of a dream
we had together

55:45.080 --> 55:47.344
but it just never happened.

55:49.433 --> 55:51.565
I think that's why I feel so
connected to her here.

55:54.394 --> 55:55.656
Christmas can do that to people.

55:57.441 --> 55:58.529
ANDREW: Okay, now you sound like
one of your

55:58.572 --> 56:00.357
sappy holiday novels.

56:00.400 --> 56:01.183
CLAIRE: Stop.

56:01.227 --> 56:02.663

56:04.273 --> 56:06.319

MRS T: Did you have a good time
last night?

56:22.379 --> 56:23.423
CLAIRE: Oh I did.

56:24.337 --> 56:25.773
It was so beautiful.

The church in the woods,
with the lights.

56:28.646 --> 56:29.995
Hi.

56:30.038 --> 56:31.257
It felt like the holidays.

56:32.476 --> 56:33.912
What happened?

56:33.955 --> 56:36.305
MRS T: We had a run on bells
yesterday afternoon.

56:36.349 --> 56:38.830
A woman from Maine bought
six of them.

56:38.873 --> 56:40.048
CLAIRE: Really!

56:40.092 --> 56:41.441
Oh that's fantastic!

56:41.485 --> 56:43.400
Hey, Alicia, can you go down
and ask Andrew

56:43.443 --> 56:45.271
if he can put together some
more bells?

56:45.314 --> 56:47.142
ALICIA: Sure.
CLAIRE: Great.

56:47.186 --> 56:48.361
Ah!

56:53.758 --> 56:54.976
No, no, no, no, no, no,

56:55.020 --> 56:56.151
I don't want to move
the closing date.

56:56.195 --> 56:58.197
I've already delayed
the sale a month.

56:58.240 --> 57:00.895
I need the bookstore to close
escrow right after the first.

57:00.939 --> 57:02.419
No, I can't move it again.

57:02.462 --> 57:04.421
No, no, it's gotta be the
beginning of the month.

57:05.987 --> 57:07.859
I can't wait any longer.

57:21.960 --> 57:23.352
Are you okay?

57:24.353 --> 57:27.182
ALICIA: I accidentally overheard
Andrew on the phone.

57:28.619 --> 57:29.881
CLAIRE: What happened?

57:32.753 --> 57:34.320
ALICIA: I think he was talking
to someone

57:34.363 --> 57:36.844
about selling the bookstore.

57:36.888 --> 57:38.367
CLAIRE: What?

57:48.247 --> 57:49.248
CLAIRE: Why didn't you tell me?

57:50.379 --> 57:51.511
ANDREW: About what?

57:51.555 --> 57:52.904
CLAIRE: You're selling the
bookstore?

57:54.601 --> 57:55.994
ANDREW: Look, I appreciate all
you've done around here Claire.

57:56.037 --> 57:58.126
I do, but you don't need to
get involved in this.

57:58.170 --> 57:59.040
It's not a big deal.

57:59.084 --> 58:00.694
CLAIRE: It is a big deal.

58:00.738 --> 58:01.826
Why did you let me do
all of this work

58:01.869 --> 58:03.436
if you knew you were closing?

58:03.480 --> 58:05.351
Things have turned around.

58:05.394 --> 58:07.353
The bookstore's doing better.

58:07.396 --> 58:08.789
ANDREW: It's not sustainable.

58:08.833 --> 58:10.661
Okay after the holidays this
little uptick

58:10.704 --> 58:12.140

58:13.620 --> 58:16.144
CLAIRE: You know, I evaluate
companies for a living,

58:16.188 --> 58:17.494
and from what I can see-

58:17.537 --> 58:19.104
ANDREW: I can't do this on
my own Claire.

58:19.147 --> 58:21.193
You made this place come alive.

58:21.236 --> 58:23.804
But if you go back to New York,
what am I supposed to do?

news, nothing's changing.

58:29.027 --> 58:30.507

closing down.

So all of your hard work
is not in vain.

58:34.119 --> 58:35.424

is being sold,

58:35.468 --> 58:36.600
but the bookstore
and the apartment,

58:36.643 --> 58:38.166

real estate broker in the area

58:50.048 --> 58:51.005
and he's paying a fair price.

58:51.049 --> 58:52.746
CLAIRE: Yeah, in a down market.

58:52.790 --> 58:53.965
It's perfect timing for him.

Claire.

it in writing.

any of our events.

We're very proud of her.

to be a writer.

about NYU.

everyone

she wanted to be a veterinarian.

good for someone like you,
