00:01.619 --> 00:03.865
Business at <i>Rent-a-Swag</i>
could not be better.

00:03.866 --> 00:06.246
Yesterday Jaden Smith came in,
and he was like,

00:06.247 --> 00:09.385
"Look, I want to quit the music/acting
business and work here with you."

00:09.386 --> 00:11.183
And I was like,
"Jaden, be serious.

00:11.184 --> 00:12.734
The world needs you.
You have a gift."

00:12.735 --> 00:14.989
Ever since my client opened
his store across the street,

00:15.024 --> 00:16.448
your sales have plummeted.

00:16.449 --> 00:19.153
It's only a matter of time
before you're out of business.

00:19.459 --> 00:21.793
But my client has had
a moment of weakness,

00:21.828 --> 00:24.620
something he
referred to as "sympathy"?

00:25.004 --> 00:26.464
He's made you a final offer...

00:26.465 --> 00:29.251
$40,000 for <i>Rent-a-Swag</i>
and all of its contents.

00:29.252 --> 00:30.752
I suggest you take it.

00:30.787 --> 00:33.981
Well, I've heard all the facts, and
it's pretty obvious what I have to do...

00:33.982 --> 00:37.592
Get a big old mug of hot chocolate, put
on my thinking PJs, and get back to you.

00:37.627 --> 00:40.195
The offer is valid
for 48 hours.

00:40.229 --> 00:42.938
We would also be interested
in acquiring your thinking PJs.

00:42.939 --> 00:45.832
Listen to me
very carefully.

00:45.833 --> 00:47.269
No matter what happens,

00:47.320 --> 00:50.005
you will <i>never</i> acquire

00:50.039 --> 00:51.560
my thinking PJs

00:51.561 --> 00:54.943
or my YouTube blazer...

00:54.944 --> 00:57.445
Nonnegotiable.

Sorry. Sorry.

01:19.673 --> 01:22.008
Larry, everyone else was able to make it
to the committee meeting on time.

01:22.042 --> 01:23.242
What's your excuse?

01:23.243 --> 01:25.244
I was voting for you
in the recall election.

01:25.278 --> 01:27.379
Lots of people wearing
Leslie Knope buttons.

01:28.532 --> 01:31.553
No discussion about the recall election
until the polls close at 8:00.

01:31.585 --> 01:33.386
Let's focus
on what we can control.

01:33.420 --> 01:36.038
In 24 hours, we are going
to transform City Hall

01:36.073 --> 01:38.524
into the best haunted house
Pawnee has ever seen.

01:38.542 --> 01:39.992
There's been a mistake.

01:40.010 --> 01:42.562
This says that I'm in charge
of the silly skeleton room,

01:42.596 --> 01:45.581
when really it should say
"the undead serial killer room."

01:45.632 --> 01:49.602
- Who do I talk to about changing this?
- It's recall day. I've made my case,

01:49.603 --> 01:52.071
and the latest polls have it
as a dead heat,

01:52.089 --> 01:54.528
so there's nothing
left to do but wait.

01:54.529 --> 01:58.048
I'm fine. I mean, I got stuff to do.
I'm planning a haunted house.

01:58.082 --> 02:00.067
Plus, um...

02:00.101 --> 02:02.517
It's Kevin Pollack’s birthday.

02:02.518 --> 02:04.171
That's something
to focus on today.

02:04.205 --> 02:07.785
Who cares about the recall?
It's Kevin's day.

02:08.226 --> 02:09.642
I don't know what to do...

02:09.661 --> 02:12.863
I could take the offer and break even,
but I've come so far.

02:12.897 --> 02:17.369
Ron, can you put some more tiny
marshmallow in my hot chocky?

02:18.433 --> 02:19.583
Thank you.

02:19.584 --> 02:22.189
If there was something
I could do for you, I would.

02:22.223 --> 02:23.991
Maybe you should try
taking a walk...

02:24.025 --> 02:25.325
Out of my office.

02:27.045 --> 02:30.647
- Ron! You're in <i>Bloosh!</i>
- What?

02:30.682 --> 02:33.500
- Ron's in <i>Bloosh?</i>
- Ron is in <i>Bloosh!</i>

02:35.202 --> 02:36.544
What is <i>Bloosh?</i>

02:36.610 --> 02:39.696
<i>Bloosh</i> is a weekly lifestyle
email written by Annabel Porter.

02:39.697 --> 02:41.970
She used to be the face
of the Eagleton phone book.

02:41.999 --> 02:43.583
Then she moved to Hollywood
to pursue her dream

02:43.634 --> 02:45.802
of becoming friends
with a bunch of celebrities.

02:45.836 --> 02:48.154
Then she moved back
to become a lifestyle guru.

02:48.189 --> 02:49.394
She's legit.

02:49.395 --> 02:52.090
She spent four months living
in Kate Bosworth's pool house.

02:52.091 --> 02:56.529
"A Ron Swanson-designed chair is
<i>the</i> must-have item of the season,"

02:56.564 --> 03:00.306
"along with red quinoa, wind therapy,
and buying an island."

03:00.326 --> 03:01.880
Annabel says
that buying an island

03:01.881 --> 03:05.730
is the only real way to know that
your goji-berry farm is pesticide-free.

03:05.773 --> 03:08.541
I've been trying to get
Rent-a-Swag in <i>Bloosh</i> for months.

03:08.592 --> 03:12.224
And now that you got in, I can get in too.
Congratulations, Ron! We did it!

03:12.225 --> 03:15.327
- Someone's getting a new leather jacket.
- I don't want a leather jacket.

03:15.361 --> 03:17.784
It's for me.
This is a great day!

03:18.281 --> 03:19.898
Ron's in <i>Bloosh!</i>

03:19.933 --> 03:21.934
- Ron's in <i>Bloosh!</i>
<i>- What?</i>

03:21.985 --> 03:23.118
Ron's in <i>Bloosh!</i>

03:23.153 --> 03:25.120
- Do it.
- Ron's in <i>Bloosh!</i>

03:27.533 --> 03:31.376
April, you seem depressed,
and I would know.

03:31.377 --> 03:34.162
I spent most of last year being
treated by Dr. Richard Nygard

03:34.163 --> 03:35.597
for my own
emotional problems.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.349
Yeah, I just miss Andy.

03:37.400 --> 03:40.452
Halloween was, like,
kind of our thing.

03:40.453 --> 03:43.496
Every year, we would dress up
like demons and egg Larry's house.

03:43.497 --> 03:45.390
- That was you?
- Larry, please.

03:45.425 --> 03:46.642
We're having
a private conversation.

03:46.676 --> 03:48.911
Well, I'd like to make Halloween
fun for you,

03:48.945 --> 03:51.288
like Andy would have,
starting right now...

03:51.289 --> 03:53.265
With scary,
scary monster claws!

03:53.267 --> 03:56.652
Okay, people, the grand
opening is in 20 hours.

03:56.686 --> 03:59.288
Larry, you had
the easiest job...

03:59.322 --> 04:00.489
Two triangles and a tooth.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.475
Nobody wants Gengurch-family-themed
Jack-o-lanterns.

04:03.476 --> 04:06.161
- Gayle likes them.
- Is any of this even good?

04:06.196 --> 04:08.480
Why didn't we call it
"City Hall-oween"?

04:08.515 --> 04:10.516
Okay, we need to change
every single banner.

04:10.550 --> 04:12.100
Leslie's been holding it
together pretty well,

04:12.134 --> 04:14.369
but today is when
she needs us the most.

04:14.404 --> 04:17.839
That's why we formed the Leslie
Knope emotional support task force.

04:17.874 --> 04:20.676
Anything she could possibly need
to get her through these final hours,

04:20.709 --> 04:22.411
we got it covered...

04:22.445 --> 04:26.348
Back rubs, YouTube videos of turtles
and birds becoming friends...

04:26.349 --> 04:30.285
A poster announcing
the new Lilith Fair concert.

04:30.286 --> 04:32.064
It's fake,
but it'll buy us an hour.

04:32.065 --> 04:35.020
We even have a secret hand signal
in case we think she needs help.

04:36.226 --> 04:38.777
It's loosely based
on the Klingon greeting salute.

04:38.828 --> 04:42.114
I just learned that. And if I had known,
I would not have agreed to it.

04:42.148 --> 04:46.694
Uh, hey, Leslie, how about instead of
slightly changing a lot of banners,

04:46.695 --> 04:49.697
we paint our toenails
to look like pumpkins?

04:49.739 --> 04:52.040
Fun!
Ann, you're a genius!

04:52.074 --> 04:55.044
Your brain is almost as perfect
as your face.

04:55.929 --> 04:58.929
Hey, Ron, baby, what are
the hot deets on <i>Bloosh?</i>

04:58.930 --> 05:01.216
Start over
and speak differently.

05:01.251 --> 05:03.719
Sorry. Did you call that P.R. guy?
What's the latest news?

05:03.753 --> 05:06.905
Apparently, Joan Callamezzo
wants me to go on <i>Pawnee Today</i>

05:06.940 --> 05:09.258
to discuss my chairs
with this Porter woman.

05:09.292 --> 05:10.509
I said no.

05:10.543 --> 05:13.095
Ron, you said if there was something
you could do to help me, you would.

05:13.129 --> 05:15.697
Getting in <i>Bloosh</i> is my last
chance to save my store.

05:15.731 --> 05:17.399
You have to go and take me
so I can meet her.

05:17.417 --> 05:18.834
- Please?
- Fine.

05:18.868 --> 05:21.086
If it's that important
to your company, I'll do it.

05:21.120 --> 05:22.437
Yes!

05:22.472 --> 05:26.942
Now, I know high-end, Internet-only
lifestyle magazine really isn't your scene,

05:26.960 --> 05:30.312
so Donna and I wrote up
some cocktail banter

05:30.346 --> 05:34.149
and some conversation snippets
for you to practice so you can fit in.

05:34.183 --> 05:38.887
"Annabel, could I be more <i>jels</i>
of your low-lights right now?"

05:38.922 --> 05:42.495
"I mean, O.M.Squee,
talk about bangs envy."

05:42.496 --> 05:44.631
Oof, you got a long way
to go, Swanson.

05:44.691 --> 05:48.067
- Let's go again, from the top.
- I regret everything.

05:48.157 --> 05:50.758
- Babe, you made it. It's 8:00.
- Thank God.

05:50.759 --> 05:53.594
Okay, everyone,
great work, as always.

05:53.595 --> 05:57.239
I'm gonna stay here and just kind
of wait for the results to pour in.

05:57.273 --> 05:58.957
Thank you.
I'll see you all tomorrow.

05:59.008 --> 06:01.190
We're not going anywhere.
We're staying with you.

06:01.210 --> 06:03.312
No, really, it's gonna be
hours before they call it.

06:03.346 --> 06:06.231
We're not leaving, woman.
Stop trying to get rid of us.

06:06.266 --> 06:09.067
Yeah, I made frappuccinos
for a little caffeine boost,

06:09.118 --> 06:10.619
and Larry went to get pizzas
for everyone.

06:10.653 --> 06:12.654
Aw, that's very sweet,
you guys.

06:12.688 --> 06:13.855
Thank you.

06:13.873 --> 06:16.875
All right, let's hunker down.
It's gonna be a long night.

06:19.662 --> 06:22.331
<i>Too close to call,
a real nail-biter,</i>

06:22.365 --> 06:23.732
<i>anybody's game...</i>

06:23.766 --> 06:26.034
<i>These are three phrases
you won't hear tonight,</i>

06:26.069 --> 06:28.470
<i>as Leslie Knope has been voted
out of office.</i>

06:28.504 --> 06:30.493
<i>What was expected to be

06:30.508 --> 06:31.524
What did he say?

06:31.525 --> 06:33.091
<i>...Has actually been
a not close race.</i>

06:33.142 --> 06:36.445
<i>Pawnee voters have decisively
removed Leslie Knope...</i>

06:36.479 --> 06:38.313
- Honey, I'm so sorry.
<i>- ...From the City Council.</i>

06:38.348 --> 06:41.183
♪ I got-a the pizza

06:41.217 --> 06:43.068
pizza time,
it's-a pizza time!

06:43.102 --> 06:45.237
Larry, everyone is
miserable,

06:45.271 --> 06:47.605
and you are
only making it worse.

06:50.341 --> 06:52.514
- Okay, Leslie's on her way in.
- Is she okay?

06:52.568 --> 06:53.866
I left her, like,
30 voice mails,

06:53.867 --> 06:57.770
and her outgoing message is just her
sobbing and burping and crazy laughing.

06:57.804 --> 07:00.745
Yeah, you know what?
She's actually handling it pretty well.

07:01.391 --> 07:03.225
What's up, fartwads?

07:03.260 --> 07:05.144
Are you eating
a paunch burger?

07:05.162 --> 07:07.446
Well, you know what?
If you can't beat 'em, join 'em.

07:07.464 --> 07:11.049
I mean, I've been boycotting them
ever since pinewood and her goons

07:11.067 --> 07:13.886
started this whole recall business,
but who cares now, right?

07:13.904 --> 07:16.405
What does it matter?
Nothing matters anymore.

07:16.439 --> 07:18.524
Mmm. Oh, my God.
This is good.

07:18.558 --> 07:20.259
This is really good.

07:20.293 --> 07:21.944
Why did I ever fight this?

07:21.995 --> 07:23.995
Have you thought
about a concession speech?

07:23.997 --> 07:25.497
Oh, concession speech?

07:25.515 --> 07:28.239
Yeah, I wrote one.

07:29.119 --> 07:31.875
"Eat my shorts, Jabronies.
Knope, out."

07:31.876 --> 07:35.440
I thought it best to revisit
the concession speech at a later time.

07:36.614 --> 07:39.011
But we should focus
on the haunted house.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.213
And you know what I think
it needs, actually,

07:41.231 --> 07:45.150
is a papier-mâché
li'l Sebastian!

07:45.168 --> 07:46.852
- What?
- Oh!

07:49.990 --> 07:52.925
I'm gonna go fall asleep
on a bench.

07:57.981 --> 07:59.865
I can honestly say

07:59.899 --> 08:03.233
today's guest is the only person
in this town

08:03.234 --> 08:06.201
who's a bigger deal than I am.

08:06.656 --> 08:10.893
Please welcome lifestyle guru
Annabel Porter.

08:10.944 --> 08:14.413
Hello, hello.
It's me. I'm here.

08:14.447 --> 08:16.498
- Yes, you are.
- Hi.

08:16.550 --> 08:18.500
Can I just say,
as a journalist,

08:18.535 --> 08:21.170
I feel like
we're best friends.

08:21.204 --> 08:23.172
Tell the audience
about yourself.

08:23.206 --> 08:28.160
Well, I'm just a simple former
phonebook model who found her calling.

08:28.195 --> 08:30.296
- You know, I'm not perfect.
- Oh.

08:30.330 --> 08:33.065
The average woman worries about
what she looks like in a bathing suit.

08:33.099 --> 08:36.001
So does my nanny.
So I get it.

08:36.035 --> 08:37.720
Annabel, what trends are...

08:37.754 --> 08:40.443
Pardon the pun, but...
Trending?

08:40.443 --> 08:44.943
First of all, Mozambique cashmere
is the new cast-iron stove.

08:44.961 --> 08:46.411
Of course.

08:46.429 --> 08:49.698
I have found some amazing new
conflict-free paella recipes,

08:49.733 --> 08:53.703
and, luckily, my favorite fishmonger
now makes house calls.

08:53.704 --> 08:55.579
- Thank God.
- Finally.

08:55.580 --> 09:01.010
But my fave new item
is a deliciously bold chair...

09:01.044 --> 09:03.484
- Ooh.
- By local artist Ron Swanson.

09:03.485 --> 09:04.935
Ron Swanson is here.

09:04.994 --> 09:09.301
He will be joining us after
the break, so stick around.

09:09.336 --> 09:12.504
Did that woman
call my chair "delicious"?

09:12.522 --> 09:14.657
Whoo, Happy Halloween.

09:14.708 --> 09:16.675
Oh, caterpillar!
Thank you.

09:16.710 --> 09:18.761
Hey, guys, come on in.

09:18.812 --> 09:22.331
- Welcome to the den of horrors.
- Where's all the scary stuff?

09:22.365 --> 09:24.133
Scary stuff
is invisible, Leah...

09:24.167 --> 09:27.552
Broken dreams, disappointment,
achieving your greatest goal

09:27.570 --> 09:29.071
and having it
all fall apart

09:29.122 --> 09:31.123
and knowing that you'll never
climb any higher.

09:31.157 --> 09:32.841
Can we have some candy?

09:32.876 --> 09:34.810
I'm gonna give you something
sweeter than candy, Ryan...

09:34.844 --> 09:35.961
The truth.

09:35.996 --> 09:39.097
It's very possible that some
of you have already peaked.

09:39.115 --> 09:41.216
It's all downhill
from here, turkeys.

09:41.251 --> 09:43.686
Okay, let's say good-bye
to Ms. Knope, kids.

09:43.737 --> 09:44.820
It is Ms. Knope.

09:44.904 --> 09:47.706
It's not city councilwoman Knope, because
that chapter of my life is already over.

09:47.740 --> 09:50.042
Just remember, kids,

09:50.060 --> 09:51.977
nothing gold can stay.

09:52.011 --> 09:53.696
Okay.

09:53.747 --> 09:57.716
Oh, my goodness, we are back
with America's greatest leader...

09:57.751 --> 09:59.318
Annabel Porter

09:59.352 --> 10:01.820
and her new favorite artisan,

10:01.855 --> 10:04.423
local woodworker
Ron Swanson.

10:04.457 --> 10:05.708
Hello.

10:05.742 --> 10:08.227
I discovered Ron's chairs
a few months ago,

10:08.261 --> 10:11.880
and what I absolutely love
about a Swanson

10:11.915 --> 10:14.066
is you can really use it
for anything.

10:14.100 --> 10:16.719
Yes, mostly you use it
for sitting.

10:16.770 --> 10:19.638
Make it a rustic accent piece
in your solarium.

10:19.656 --> 10:22.884
Even better, use it as a focal point
in your yoga tent.

10:22.885 --> 10:25.094
Put it by a table
and eat a meal.

10:25.145 --> 10:28.030
We don't do
<i>meals</i> in my home.

10:28.064 --> 10:32.067
No, every two hours, we eat
what I like to call a food tease,

10:32.102 --> 10:35.104
like an oat wedge
or a seaweed lozenge.

10:35.138 --> 10:36.355
Can I just say...

10:36.389 --> 10:38.507
And I think this is
really important,

10:38.541 --> 10:41.543
so I need everyone
to shut up...

10:41.594 --> 10:45.097
- I love your hair.
- Oh. Thank you.

10:45.131 --> 10:47.032
It's genetic
and unattainable.

10:50.870 --> 10:53.305
I am scaring you!

10:53.339 --> 10:54.890
I could see you.

10:54.941 --> 10:57.309
There's, like, a million mirrors
in front of me.

10:57.327 --> 10:59.913
And you're never gonna make me
not miss Andy, okay?

10:59.914 --> 11:03.915
What about this? I'm Bert Macklin,
friendly lifeguard.

11:03.933 --> 11:07.586
Bert Macklin is not a lifeguard.
He's an FBI agent.

11:07.620 --> 11:11.390
- Really? That's even harder to believe.
- Just stop, okay?

11:11.424 --> 11:14.226
Your lame attempts at trying
to cheer me up are not working.

11:14.260 --> 11:18.247
Now I'm sad that I miss Andy and sad
that I can't make fun of you to Andy.

11:18.298 --> 11:20.849
I understand. I'm sorry.

11:20.884 --> 11:24.521
I've failed you, both
as a scary monster and a friend.

11:34.948 --> 11:38.116
- Hey, I am really sorry.
- I know you must feel awful.

11:38.134 --> 11:39.635
I don't feel awful.

11:39.686 --> 11:42.271
You know, actually,
I feel like I can finally relax.

11:42.305 --> 11:44.556
Accepting that you've peaked
is very freeing.

11:44.574 --> 11:45.824
Yeah, I know the feeling.

11:45.858 --> 11:48.527
I was impeached when I was 18,
and it was brutal.

11:48.545 --> 11:51.313
But you just have to keep
climbing back up that hill.

11:51.347 --> 11:53.198
Or do you?

11:53.233 --> 11:56.585
Maybe instead of working
super hard to rebuild your life,

11:56.619 --> 12:01.039
you just said, "I peaked.
Wow. What a great run."

12:01.057 --> 12:03.859
"And now I'm going to spend
the rest of my life really chill."

12:03.910 --> 12:07.054
Well, sure, I mean, part of that
sounds very appealing.

12:07.055 --> 12:08.931
- Yeah.
- But, n-no.

12:08.982 --> 12:11.049
Uh, see, I-it was important
for me...

12:11.067 --> 12:13.518
See, I took a job in City
budget crisis management,

12:13.536 --> 12:16.941
and now I work
for a candy charity.

12:17.816 --> 12:19.641
Oh, God, did I peak
when I was 18?

12:19.692 --> 12:22.093
- There it is.
- Drink up.

12:24.948 --> 12:26.148
- Whoo!
- Shots!

12:28.268 --> 12:30.853
B-13 shots.

12:30.904 --> 12:32.654
Bird bath salts.

12:32.705 --> 12:35.657
Wha...?
Champagne decanters!

12:35.708 --> 12:37.926
This is heaven.

12:37.961 --> 12:39.561
I love your chair.

12:39.596 --> 12:41.613
I need 12 for my stepdaughter's
craft room.

12:41.648 --> 12:44.566
Well, I make two a year,
so maybe in six years.

12:44.567 --> 12:46.134
- Can you put me on the wait list?
- Me too...

12:46.160 --> 12:49.004
Unless your chair was ever touched
by someone who ate refined sugar.

12:49.055 --> 12:51.968
Then I can't buy any of your chairs,
and I protest this entire event.

12:51.969 --> 12:53.859
Okay, Ron,
Annabel’s coming over.

12:53.893 --> 12:57.288
When you talk me up, be sure
to mention that you really admire

12:57.314 --> 13:00.215
how I take big risks
with men's neck accessories.

13:00.250 --> 13:03.051
- There he is.
- Hello, hello.

13:03.102 --> 13:06.188
Thank you for your kind words
about my chairs, Miss Porter.

13:06.239 --> 13:07.439
No, thank us.

13:07.457 --> 13:10.342
You are about to make
a ton of money.

13:10.376 --> 13:11.927
I want to license
your designs.

13:11.978 --> 13:15.948
We are going to put Swanson chairs
in every six-bedroom home in the Midwest.

13:15.982 --> 13:19.051
If my chairs were mass-produced,
they wouldn't be Swanson chairs.

13:19.085 --> 13:21.620
Swanson chairs are handmade.

13:21.638 --> 13:24.723
Yes, and now they will be made
by thousands of tiny Chinese hands.

13:25.775 --> 13:29.611
Oh, Miss Porter, this is
my very good friend Tom Haverford.

13:29.646 --> 13:33.382
He's a big fan of your...
Whatever you call what you do.

13:33.416 --> 13:35.700
Please speak to each other
while I leave.

13:35.718 --> 13:39.209
Oh, no, I am not done with you,
you wicked little so-and-so.

13:39.210 --> 13:40.440
Terrific.

13:40.488 --> 13:43.325
You know what? I had my time, you know?
I did my thing.

13:43.359 --> 13:46.643
I wanted to be a city councilor, and
I did, and I was, and I was like, whoo!

13:46.644 --> 13:48.197
And the people were like,
pffft!

13:48.248 --> 13:52.084
- At least we have each other.
- I love you so much.

13:52.118 --> 13:53.785
I love you too.

13:53.803 --> 13:55.053
- This is real.
- I know.

13:55.088 --> 13:56.770
- You're my husband.
- You're my wife.

13:56.789 --> 13:59.224
- You married me in front of people.
- I did. I was there.

13:59.259 --> 14:00.509
We may have peaked,
but it doesn't matter.

14:00.560 --> 14:02.761
We need to do something big,
you know,

14:02.795 --> 14:04.162
something that really lets
people know

14:04.197 --> 14:05.931
that we're gonna love
each other forever.

14:05.965 --> 14:08.901
- Yeah! What is it?
- I got it.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.636
Hello, sir.
We are sober.

14:11.637 --> 14:14.172
We would like to get tattoos
on our bodies, 'cause we love each other.

14:14.190 --> 14:16.258
Tattoos?
This is a pawnshop.

14:16.292 --> 14:18.744
- But, yeah, sure, I can do that.
- Awww!

14:18.778 --> 14:20.746
Yes! It happened!

14:20.780 --> 14:23.532
Look what he's doing.
He's breaking pens.

14:23.583 --> 14:27.119
- This is the idea of the century.
- Right here.

14:28.821 --> 14:30.822
Come here.

14:32.665 --> 14:36.645
My store is called <i>Rent-a-Swag.</i>
It's a clothing rental service for teens.

14:36.679 --> 14:38.609
It's an interesting idea.
Are you guys doing well?

14:38.610 --> 14:40.406
- We're doing amazing.
- Mm.

14:40.407 --> 14:42.327
And it'd be perfect
for <i>Bloosh.</i>

14:42.335 --> 14:44.631
Why don't you take out whatever
you wrote about my chairs

14:44.666 --> 14:47.750
and put something in
about Rent-a-Swag instead?

14:47.751 --> 14:51.397
This month's trends are final.
I can't just throw a trend out.

14:51.559 --> 14:56.158
But my <i>bloosh</i> scouts have started
trend-tracking for the February zine blast.

14:56.159 --> 14:59.078
- Good God, these words.
- I'll have them stop by your store.

14:59.112 --> 15:01.098
That'll be too late.
We'll be out of business by then.

15:01.106 --> 15:02.690
I thought you said
you were doing well.

15:02.741 --> 15:06.343
Ronnie, one last time, have you
reconsidered mass production?

15:06.378 --> 15:09.214
I can sell your chairs
on my site.

15:09.215 --> 15:10.349
No, thank you, ma'am.

15:10.383 --> 15:13.669
I'm not interested in letting
someone else sell my work.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.017
Well, that's too bad.

15:17.057 --> 15:20.977
This party is over.
It no longer is.

15:21.011 --> 15:22.144
It was.

15:22.179 --> 15:26.160
- It was...? That was my last shot.
- Sorry, Tommy.

15:26.161 --> 15:29.218
Let's just grab some of that
lychee body oil and bounce.

15:29.219 --> 15:31.470
Can you grab me some of those
pomegranate face masks too?

15:31.488 --> 15:33.151
Fo' sho'.

15:33.373 --> 15:35.007
Can I ask you a question?

15:35.042 --> 15:36.642
Are we the cutest couple
you've ever seen?

15:36.676 --> 15:37.943
Nope.

15:37.977 --> 15:40.092
Okay, you want the long needle
or the short needle?

15:40.093 --> 15:42.515
Doesn't matter. Can't find
a short needle. Long needle it is.

15:42.549 --> 15:43.882
I have a big idea.

15:43.900 --> 15:47.086
I want a portrait
of Eleanor Roosevelt,

15:47.120 --> 15:48.504
tastefully done,

15:48.538 --> 15:52.808
and then she has a very classy
tattoo of Pat Benatar on her arm.

15:52.859 --> 15:54.560
And that's very subtle.

15:54.578 --> 15:57.346
No, scratch that. Scratch all that.
Just write "Ben".

15:57.381 --> 15:58.964
Do you have anything
to numb the pain?

15:58.982 --> 16:01.900
Sure, take a scoop
out of the pill bucket.

16:01.918 --> 16:04.536
Okay, you said you wanted
"mouth queen"?

16:04.554 --> 16:07.023
No, stop. Stop it. Stop
everything that you're doing.

16:07.057 --> 16:09.858
- Stop it.
- Ann's here! Ann wants a tattoo!

16:09.860 --> 16:10.926
- Ann!
- No, no!

16:10.961 --> 16:12.211
- Ann!
- No!

16:12.229 --> 16:15.581
Shh! Ann does not want a tattoo.
No one wants a tattoo.

16:15.615 --> 16:17.116
Ann, relax.

16:17.134 --> 16:19.301
Be "respitable"
for a second, okay?

16:19.353 --> 16:21.037
What we are doing
is not nuts.

16:21.071 --> 16:22.321
We are merely getting tattoos

16:22.355 --> 16:25.057
so that everybody knows we love each
other and that we haven't peaked.

16:25.092 --> 16:28.444
- It makes a lot of sense.
- Okay, we're leaving, all right?

16:28.495 --> 16:30.396
So say good-bye
to the nice man

16:30.414 --> 16:32.998
and thank me for saving you
from being on <i>dateline.</i>

16:33.032 --> 16:34.233
Okay, let's go.
Come on.

16:34.267 --> 16:36.902
- Good-bye, world traveler.
- Later, bro Heisen.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.088
- Go.
- Come on.

16:40.924 --> 16:43.159
I don't want to be
a failure again, Ron.

16:43.193 --> 16:45.327
There's no shame
in failure

16:45.379 --> 16:46.745
if you gave it
an honest effort.

16:46.763 --> 16:48.047
Easy for you to say.

16:48.081 --> 16:49.665
People are dying to give you
money for your business,

16:49.699 --> 16:50.849
and you didn't even take it.

16:50.867 --> 16:54.787
I didn't sell my chairs to that website
because I value my name.

16:54.821 --> 16:57.390
The only thing that's important
at the end of the day

16:57.424 --> 16:59.825
is what's on your gravestone...
Your name.

16:59.826 --> 17:01.794
My gravestone's gonna be
a 60-inch touchscreen

17:01.828 --> 17:03.145
with a hologram
of four mes

17:03.196 --> 17:06.682
singing <i>End of the Road</i>
by <i>Boyz II Men...</i>

17:06.715 --> 17:08.050
But point taken.

17:08.101 --> 17:12.570
Ben, what is the first rule of the Leslie
Knope emotional support task force?

17:12.606 --> 17:14.290
Don't let her get
a tattoo.

17:14.324 --> 17:16.415
- What the hell happened?
- I couldn't help it.

17:16.443 --> 17:19.978
She's so cute when she's coming up
with destructive ideas.

17:19.996 --> 17:22.498
Never send a husband
to do a best friend's job.

17:22.531 --> 17:23.965
Out, Wyatt.
Walk it off.

17:24.017 --> 17:26.569
- Walk it off.
- Fine.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.232
- You did it.
- Yep.

17:29.289 --> 17:31.340
- See you later, Ann.
- No, Knope, sit down.

17:32.676 --> 17:36.729
- You are avoiding your problems.
- What? No, I'm not.

17:36.763 --> 17:39.003
- Can we talk about this tomorrow?
- You were down in the polls.

17:39.004 --> 17:41.716
Your opponents were well funded
and well organized.

17:41.717 --> 17:43.652
You must have known
this would be a possibility.

17:43.653 --> 17:46.605
Intellectually, I knew
that I might be in trouble,

17:46.623 --> 17:48.757
but deep in my heart,
I never really thought...

17:48.792 --> 17:50.359
Ben and I tried
to help you,

17:50.393 --> 17:52.975
but as usual, you're
the best person for the job.

17:52.976 --> 17:55.545
You need to hear yourself
read this.

17:57.482 --> 18:00.068
"They held the recall
election, and I lost."

18:01.569 --> 18:03.620
"I was voted out of office."

18:03.638 --> 18:07.044
"In 30 days, I will no longer be
a Pawnee city councilor."

18:07.045 --> 18:08.662
Oh, it's so hard to read
when you're drunk.

18:08.680 --> 18:10.044
Keep going.

18:10.065 --> 18:11.773
"But I am Leslie Knope."

18:11.774 --> 18:14.309
"I am more
than a city councilor."

18:14.424 --> 18:17.726
"I am an unstoppable force
of energy."

18:17.727 --> 18:23.198
"And I will use those days
to work as hard as I can."

18:23.214 --> 18:25.696
These are all
your ongoing projects,

18:25.697 --> 18:28.053
everything you're currently
working on for Pawnee.

18:28.087 --> 18:30.055
You have things to do.

18:30.089 --> 18:32.224
You have a month left.
Use it.

18:32.258 --> 18:35.093
Ann, you poetic
and noble land mermaid,

18:35.144 --> 18:37.162
you're right once again.

18:37.163 --> 18:38.222
Thank you.

18:38.223 --> 18:41.749
I flushed my car keys
down the toilet.

18:41.768 --> 18:44.186
No problem.

18:45.934 --> 18:48.482
Eww... stop.

18:48.750 --> 18:50.467
Hello to you too, April.

18:50.502 --> 18:53.286
I'm sorry I said
you were lame, okay?

18:53.304 --> 18:54.838
You are, but I know

18:54.889 --> 18:56.289
you were just trying
to help me, so...

18:56.307 --> 18:58.308
Thank you, April.
Happy Halloween.

18:58.343 --> 19:01.753
And if you want to egg
Larry's house, come find me.

19:02.430 --> 19:03.764
You guys are cute.

19:03.798 --> 19:06.433
- Where'd that come from?
- I'm weak.

19:06.467 --> 19:09.570
I miss Andy,
and it's making me weak.

19:09.604 --> 19:11.772
Also, if Chris puts
that much effort

19:11.806 --> 19:14.141
into making
my stupid night better,

19:14.159 --> 19:17.528
I'm sure that he'll make
your lame life perfect.

19:17.579 --> 19:20.164
Or he's secretly
super in love with me.

19:20.198 --> 19:21.398
It's probably that.

19:21.416 --> 19:24.040
That's a funny joke, April.

19:24.041 --> 19:27.004
But the truth is, I'm very
much in love with Ann.

19:28.490 --> 19:31.334
Okay, gross.
The spell's broken.

19:32.156 --> 19:36.325
I've made my decision, and I'll sell you
Rent-a-Swag, but on my terms.

19:36.326 --> 19:37.631
Which are?

19:37.665 --> 19:40.167
$40,000 for the inventory, the website,
and everything else in the store,

19:40.185 --> 19:44.095
but I keep the name Rent-a-Swag.
It's mine, and I'm keeping it.

19:45.006 --> 19:47.941
The name is actually
an important part of the sale.

19:47.976 --> 19:50.210
- Really?
- Yes. My client likes the name.

19:50.228 --> 19:53.631
It's better than Tommy's closet.
He needs the name.

19:54.783 --> 19:57.367
Well, I don't know
what to tell you, except...

19:57.402 --> 19:59.787
I'll throw in the name
in exchange for $20,000 more

19:59.821 --> 20:01.705
and 5%
of your client's business.

20:01.739 --> 20:05.409
I'll run it past my client,
but I think we have a deal.

20:05.460 --> 20:08.912
Ron said there's nothing more valuable
than my name, but he's not a businessman.

20:08.963 --> 20:10.164
I am.

20:10.198 --> 20:12.528
And now I have seed money
for my next venture.

20:12.529 --> 20:14.394
I sold out, baby.

20:15.753 --> 20:19.423
The votes have been counted,
and I have been recalled.

20:19.474 --> 20:21.384
I am, of course,
disappointed.

20:21.385 --> 20:24.544
But I am still your City
councilwoman for 30 more days,

20:24.562 --> 20:27.239
and I intend to spend
every second I have left

20:27.240 --> 20:29.592
working for you
and this great city.

20:29.882 --> 20:31.266
The thing
about being part

20:31.300 --> 20:33.485
of the Leslie Knope
emotional support task force

20:33.536 --> 20:35.958
is that
it's a very easy job.

20:35.959 --> 20:37.693
She's never down
for that long.

20:37.711 --> 20:39.695
And now that she's had
a little time to recharge,

20:39.713 --> 20:42.531
she is like a toddler
bouncing back from a nap.

20:42.549 --> 20:44.233
Hey!
There you guys are.

20:44.267 --> 20:46.719
Okay, Ben, I need some help
with the re-zoning thing.

20:46.753 --> 20:49.638
Also, I think we should paint our deck,
so I have some color samples for you.

20:49.673 --> 20:52.057
And to thank you both for being
there when I needed you,

20:52.092 --> 20:54.226
I carved your faces
into these Jack-o-lanterns.

20:54.261 --> 20:55.877
Ann, it was very hard
to capture your beauty,

20:55.896 --> 20:57.396
and, Ben, you make
a sexy pumpkin...

20:57.430 --> 20:58.514
No surprise.

20:58.548 --> 21:00.329
Love you both.
See you later.

21:00.330 --> 21:02.513
- Okay.
- Wow.

21:03.034 --> 21:04.668
This is amazing.

21:05.054 --> 21:06.522
Not bad.
