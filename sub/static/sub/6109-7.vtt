Pryce.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.022
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:04.190 --> 01:05.900
Pick up the phone.

01:10.029 --> 01:13.116
Oh, God.

01:15.326 --> 01:18.037
Hello, Olivia.

01:18.204 --> 01:21.708
Oh, God.
Thank God, Johann. You're alive.

01:21.875 --> 01:23.710
Yeah, no thanks to you.

01:23.877 --> 01:27.130
Look, I get it. You aren't
exactly compos mentis.

01:27.297 --> 01:29.257
You were desperate,
but if you want my help,

01:29.424 --> 01:31.551
you're going to have to muster
a little more self-restraint.

01:31.718 --> 01:34.137
- I'm sorry.
- No more physical assaults.

01:34.304 --> 01:36.848
- Understood?
- Yes, of course.

01:37.015 --> 01:40.268
After your little homicidal
display, I couldn't sleep.

01:40.435 --> 01:44.189
So I've been up all night,
on your behalf,

01:44.355 --> 01:46.983
and I'm close to figuring out
the bugs on your transfer.

01:47.150 --> 01:49.778
- Well, that's wonderful.
- Agreed.

01:49.944 --> 01:52.655
OK. Let me throw on some
clothes, and I'll be over ASAP.

01:52.822 --> 01:54.741
No, no, no, no.
I still need a few more hours.

01:54.908 --> 01:57.243
Oh, and by the way,

01:57.410 --> 02:01.539
exactly what "other motherfucker
hanging in the closet"

02:01.706 --> 02:03.917
were you referring to
last night?

02:04.083 --> 02:06.127
Olivia?

02:23.144 --> 02:25.897
Mm. You brought this on
yourself, Isaac.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.692
I thought you were different
than the others.

02:30.985 --> 02:32.987
But you're all the same.

02:34.072 --> 02:36.157
All the same.

02:37.367 --> 02:39.452
You leave a girl hanging.

02:41.371 --> 02:44.916
Well, at least today's Tuesday.

02:51.673 --> 02:53.174
Ahh!

03:54.569 --> 03:56.738
We could have been happy.

03:56.905 --> 03:59.240
Why did you have to
fuck everything up?

04:02.994 --> 04:05.079
Goodbye, Isaac.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.332
There's no dignity
in dying.

04:10.001 --> 04:11.669
Yeah.

04:13.254 --> 04:15.381
Goodbye, Isaac.

04:16.382 --> 04:18.968
Hello, Chango.

05:18.152 --> 05:19.988
<i>- What's your take?
- I just have one thing to say</i>

05:20.154 --> 05:22.699
<i>to all the flat-earthers and
anti-science kooks out there -</i>

05:22.865 --> 05:25.368
<i>put the crack pipe down.</i>

05:25.535 --> 05:28.746
- This can't be the right place.
- The address is on the invoice.

05:28.913 --> 05:31.332
Those fucking morons
in dispatch.

05:34.836 --> 05:38.631
Tell me if that needs
a little paprika.

05:40.425 --> 05:42.927
Alright. There you go.

05:49.225 --> 05:50.852
Is there a Shelley Godfrey here?

05:51.853 --> 05:53.563
I...I'm Shelley.

05:53.730 --> 05:55.815
We've got a delivery for you.

05:55.982 --> 05:58.359
Oh. Uh... here.

06:03.990 --> 06:05.700
I don't have any money.

06:05.867 --> 06:08.786
Oh, it's, uh, prepaid.
I just need your signature.

06:11.581 --> 06:14.000
Blankets, toilet paper,
toothpaste,

06:14.167 --> 06:17.211
toothbrushes, batteries,
flashlights, mittens.

06:17.378 --> 06:20.923
"Stay warm.
I love you, Roman."

06:22.550 --> 06:24.635
He sent this?

06:25.636 --> 06:27.847
Looks like we got us an angel.

06:58.044 --> 07:00.088
Imagine my surprise
when I found out

07:00.254 --> 07:02.090
that the crazy lady
with the knife

07:02.256 --> 07:05.760
is the fiancée of the guy
that you handed over.

07:05.927 --> 07:08.221
And your cousin.

07:08.387 --> 07:10.389
Don't you think that's funny?

07:12.100 --> 07:13.476
What do you want?

07:13.643 --> 07:15.478
That chickenhead attacked me
on my turf,

07:15.645 --> 07:17.480
in front of my people.

07:17.647 --> 07:19.732
How the fuck
does she know so much?

07:21.859 --> 07:23.945
She'd already be dead,

07:24.112 --> 07:26.322
but you stepped up,
and you did the right thing.

07:26.489 --> 07:28.533
So I'm gonna give you
one last chance.

07:28.699 --> 07:31.786
Get a leash on her,
or you both get murked.

07:35.373 --> 07:38.417
She won't be a problem.
I'll take care of it.

07:38.584 --> 07:41.504
No more warnings.
Get the fuck out of here.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.772
<i>A multifarious amount
of green algae</i>

07:59.939 --> 08:02.066
<i>incorporates arsenic
into complex organic...</i>

08:02.233 --> 08:06.028
♪ Mi mama love-a mia
Mi mama love-a mia

08:06.195 --> 08:07.947
♪ Mi mama love-a mi... ♪

08:09.365 --> 08:13.995
- What are you doing here?
- I...live here.

08:14.162 --> 08:15.621
Stay back.

08:20.293 --> 08:23.337
Dr Pryce here. I've apprehended
an intruder in my quarters.

08:23.504 --> 08:25.631
Send security right away.

08:25.798 --> 08:27.633
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.635
This must be some sort of
neural ghosting

08:29.802 --> 08:31.679
from the previous
consciousness transfer.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.557
Acute anterior phenyl discord,

08:34.724 --> 08:36.726
being an indicator of
synaptic receptor obstruction.

08:36.893 --> 08:38.352
Quite so.

08:38.519 --> 08:42.148
My presentation in Geneva
clearly states...Mac-nam.

08:42.315 --> 08:44.942
Third door to the right.
Doctor will see you now.

08:45.109 --> 08:46.944
Unhappy. Mac-nam.

08:47.111 --> 08:48.988
Subject appears to be suffering
from cognitive dysphoria...

08:49.155 --> 08:51.240
- Tiny fingers.
- ..and dissociative personality.

08:51.407 --> 08:53.201
- Tiny, purple lunchmeat...
- Fragmentation...

08:53.367 --> 08:55.786
- Resembles substructure...
- ..which suggests complications

08:55.953 --> 08:58.247
from prior experiments,
full stop.

09:04.712 --> 09:08.174
Where am I?
Doctor from big tower.

09:09.258 --> 09:10.551
Why is this?

09:10.718 --> 09:12.637
You have no memory
how you got here?

09:13.679 --> 09:15.640
Well, I'm not surprised
given the amount

09:15.806 --> 09:18.476
of Rohypnol in your system.

09:19.477 --> 09:22.396
Roofies? You were drugged.

09:22.563 --> 09:24.649
Like for sexing a woman?

09:24.815 --> 09:27.693
Also used by the muggers
who attacked you last night.

09:27.860 --> 09:29.237
Attacked?

09:29.403 --> 09:31.239
Thankfully, you had the presence
of mind to come here.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.407
We admitted you for observation.

09:35.076 --> 09:37.954
- Am I OK?
- Oh, yes, by the grace of God.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.956
But I still want to see you
back here next Tuesday

09:40.122 --> 09:42.416
for a follow-up.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.001
Everything's fine.

09:46.045 --> 09:47.964
Get this man some clothes,

09:48.130 --> 09:50.299
and see to it
that he gets home safely.

10:01.686 --> 10:03.521
Ongoing clinical observation
of the subject will be required

10:03.688 --> 10:05.523
to determine the underlying
cause and extent

10:05.690 --> 10:07.858
of these pathologies.

10:08.025 --> 10:09.860
Full stop.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.348
You look like
you've got ringworm.

10:39.515 --> 10:41.517
What do you want from me?

10:44.854 --> 10:47.315
I'm losing my mind.

10:48.316 --> 10:50.151
You don't exist.

10:50.318 --> 10:52.903
Oh, my God.

10:53.070 --> 10:56.157
What is truth? What is fable?

10:56.324 --> 10:59.660
- Where is Ruth?
- And where is Mabel?

11:02.038 --> 11:04.749
If one is aware that
one is losing one's mind,

11:04.915 --> 11:07.376
one can't really be
losing it, right?

11:07.543 --> 11:10.629
What are you asking me for?
I don't exist.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.049
Go away! Shoo! Skedaddle.

11:17.053 --> 11:18.804
Is that Isaac's phone?

11:18.971 --> 11:20.806
He left it to me in his will.

11:24.977 --> 11:26.812
You were right.

11:26.979 --> 11:29.648
This creep who took up
with your daughter

11:29.815 --> 11:31.650
is not a good person.

11:31.817 --> 11:35.738
OK. Here's the plan.

11:35.905 --> 11:39.325
First, we go drill this
Queequeg Antwerp a new asshole.

11:39.492 --> 11:40.951
- "We"?
- Then we go to the tower.

11:41.118 --> 11:42.953
And we drill Pryce
a new asshole.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.039
New assholes for everybody.

11:45.206 --> 11:47.375
Gonna be
a beautiful day.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.571
Um...

12:17.738 --> 12:20.533
- Oh. Sorry.
- Yes.

12:22.368 --> 12:23.911
You're welcome.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.626
- Uh, you can...
- Yeah.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.503
Here.

12:33.462 --> 12:34.755
Hey.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.757
Where is it? Where is it?

12:36.924 --> 12:38.426
Go long! Go long!

12:40.970 --> 12:42.555
Hi.

12:42.721 --> 12:45.599
I'm big, but harmless.
Don't be scared.

12:45.766 --> 12:47.476
I'm not.

12:47.643 --> 12:49.562
Welcome to Rooster Poot.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.939
"Poot"?

12:52.106 --> 12:54.442
Yeah. It means, uh...

12:55.443 --> 12:57.319
Have we met?

12:57.486 --> 12:59.572
No.

13:01.073 --> 13:03.784
Is there somewhere
we can speak alone?

13:12.168 --> 13:14.587
My name's Shelley, by the way.

13:14.753 --> 13:16.589
Yes. I know.

13:16.755 --> 13:19.592
How did you come to live
in such a place?

13:20.634 --> 13:23.304
Well, it's a long story.

13:24.305 --> 13:26.307
I'm not sure
I'll ever understand it.

13:27.349 --> 13:29.727
It must seem quite awful here.

13:31.061 --> 13:33.606
Actually, I find it
quite beautiful.

13:33.772 --> 13:35.357
Really?

13:35.524 --> 13:37.109
Wow.

13:42.531 --> 13:44.116
You like to read.

13:44.283 --> 13:45.993
Always.

13:50.539 --> 13:53.501
My name is Annie.
I'm your sister.

13:57.838 --> 13:59.673
It's true.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.842
Your half-sister, actually.

14:04.345 --> 14:07.598
I know my dad had a reputation
as a bit of a playboy...

14:07.765 --> 14:09.600
It isn't a father we share.

14:09.767 --> 14:12.770
- It's our mother.
- No. I would have known.

14:12.937 --> 14:16.148
When I was born,
she was very, very young.

14:16.315 --> 14:19.109
Not married, so...

14:20.277 --> 14:22.112
You're so beautiful.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.990
It must have broken her heart
to give you up.

14:26.075 --> 14:28.077
She told me that it did.

14:29.078 --> 14:31.622
And my brother. Does he know?

14:31.789 --> 14:35.376
- Yes.
- He never told me.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.382
He just found out, himself.

14:43.008 --> 14:46.053
You know what I noticed
in your brother's house?

14:46.220 --> 14:48.264
Not a single book.

14:49.765 --> 14:54.937
And a house without books
is like a mind without thoughts.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.941
Why have you come?

15:01.735 --> 15:04.697
You were gonna kill him in
public? How stupid can you be?

15:04.863 --> 15:06.365
Fuck you.

15:06.532 --> 15:08.409
If you mess with him,
he will come after you,

15:08.576 --> 15:10.411
and you will end up
in the ground, next to Andreas.

15:10.578 --> 15:12.329
Is that what you had in mind
for your honeymoon?

15:12.496 --> 15:14.707
- He was wearing the watch.
- Fuck the watch!

15:14.873 --> 15:17.167
The watch came from
a fucking assembly line!

15:23.424 --> 15:28.012
Hey, come on.
Just give me time, OK?

15:29.179 --> 15:31.557
Hell, I'll find out
who did this.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.772
Where have you been lately?

15:41.567 --> 15:44.194
And why do you keep
ducking my calls?

15:45.487 --> 15:47.781
And where the fuck is my car?

15:49.325 --> 15:50.826
I told you.

15:51.827 --> 15:54.246
We woke up and Andreas was gone.

15:56.040 --> 15:58.417
I waited. I stayed,
and he didn't come back.

15:58.584 --> 16:00.794
So I caught a ride home
with one of the other guys.

16:00.961 --> 16:03.172
I figured he'd find his way
back, eventually.

16:03.339 --> 16:05.507
So why didn't you tell that
to the cops yesterday?

16:05.674 --> 16:07.259
There was nothing to tell.

16:07.426 --> 16:09.428
So everything was cool
that night?

16:10.429 --> 16:12.264
- Yeah.
- You guys have fun?

16:12.431 --> 16:13.891
What difference
does that make now?

16:14.058 --> 16:15.893
Because I want to know!
What did you do?

16:16.060 --> 16:18.062
- Did you get a stripper?
- Yeah.

16:18.228 --> 16:20.064
Yeah, Roman sent them up
as a gift.

16:20.230 --> 16:22.066
"Them." So there were more.

16:22.232 --> 16:23.942
- Two, more?
- Yeah, there were two.

16:24.109 --> 16:26.695
The cops called me down
to the station.

16:26.862 --> 16:28.405
They played that 911 recording

16:28.572 --> 16:30.407
of the guy
who found Andreas' body.

16:30.574 --> 16:31.909
So?

16:32.076 --> 16:33.577
So whoever made that call
sounded like

16:33.744 --> 16:35.871
he was trying really, really
hard to disguise his voice.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.665
How do you know
they're disguising their voice

16:37.831 --> 16:39.667
if you don't know
who it was in the first place?

16:39.833 --> 16:41.335
Because he sounded like
a fucking robot!

16:41.502 --> 16:43.003
Why are you trying to defend
this guy, anyway?

16:43.170 --> 16:44.505
I'm not, I'm not!

16:44.672 --> 16:46.382
I know that there's something
you're not telling me.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.342
Either you're trying
to cover for someone,

16:48.509 --> 16:50.344
or you're trying to protect
my feelings, but don't.

16:50.511 --> 16:52.888
Because I'm strong,
and I can take it.

16:55.766 --> 16:59.520
We have never hidden anything
between us before.

17:01.563 --> 17:04.148
Don't let this be the thing
that breaks us apart.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.448
Three boxes
of assorted week-old bread

17:11.615 --> 17:15.868
and five crates
of sweetie frosted rice flakeys.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.538
Not very much.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.373
Well, it's enough
to eat well tonight.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.040
Let's get moving.

17:23.377 --> 17:25.212
Shelley's mom.

17:25.378 --> 17:27.589
How'd you find me here?

17:30.759 --> 17:33.887
Tell him he doesn't get
to ask the questions.

17:34.054 --> 17:38.016
Never mind about that.
I don't know what you're up to.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.769
But I'm not buying
the Mother Teresa act.

17:40.936 --> 17:43.605
I know what you've done.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.775
So how'd it feel?

17:46.942 --> 17:49.027
Did you hear the bone snap?

17:49.194 --> 17:51.447
Come on. Admit it.

17:51.613 --> 17:53.824
It was a little bit exciting,
deep down, wasn't it?

17:53.991 --> 17:56.493
- Would you stop it?
- Stop what?

17:56.660 --> 17:58.495
Did you hear
your victim scream?

17:58.662 --> 18:01.165
No. That was 20 years ago.

18:02.166 --> 18:04.460
Still dead, though, I imagine.

18:05.461 --> 18:08.130
- I served my time.
- You skipped out on probation.

18:08.297 --> 18:09.798
I was just a kid.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.010
There's an outstanding warrant
for your arrest.

18:13.177 --> 18:17.598
Ma'am...I'm taking
good care of Shelley.

18:17.765 --> 18:22.060
- Oh, I just bet he is.
- And I'm feeding people.

18:22.227 --> 18:24.062
Trying to make my life
worth something.

18:24.229 --> 18:26.064
Do you think I give a fuck
about your life?

18:26.231 --> 18:29.401
I suggest you get into your
beater and get gone permanently.

18:29.568 --> 18:30.944
But Shelley...

18:31.111 --> 18:33.906
I ever hear her name
in your mouth again,

18:34.072 --> 18:35.908
and you will beg
to be incarcerated

18:36.074 --> 18:37.951
to get out
from under my shit rain.

18:38.118 --> 18:39.953
Walk away now,

18:40.120 --> 18:42.998
and I will consider
not telling my daughter

18:43.165 --> 18:46.543
what a vicious, fraudulent
little prick you really are.

18:50.547 --> 18:52.299
You coming?

18:53.300 --> 18:54.802
You OK, boss?

18:56.637 --> 18:58.722
Yeah.

19:01.475 --> 19:03.811
So what happened to the story
we came up with?

19:03.977 --> 19:05.813
Hmm?

19:08.649 --> 19:11.401
Look, the cops came
and visited Destiny yesterday.

19:11.568 --> 19:13.737
How long do you think it's gonna
be before they land on us?

19:13.904 --> 19:15.906
We need to get
our story straight.

19:16.907 --> 19:19.576
Should we go over it again?
We met at the warehouse.

19:19.743 --> 19:21.745
We said hello to Shandor
and the guys,

19:21.912 --> 19:24.206
and then we went to the cabin,
and we got blasted.

19:24.373 --> 19:26.124
Let's say we ordered
a couple of strippers.

19:26.291 --> 19:28.126
No. We'll say
Roman sent them up.

19:28.293 --> 19:30.170
You know,
at least we can stick to that.

19:30.337 --> 19:32.172
- Two whores.
- No, strippers.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.716
Alright, two strippers.
They worked out on each other.

19:34.883 --> 19:36.718
- Roman brought 'em, and then...
- No, no, no.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.762
Roman wasn't there.
He sent them up.

19:40.138 --> 19:41.974
They brought a tough guy,
'cause those girls,

19:42.140 --> 19:44.268
- they always come with security.
- No guy. Just the women.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.270
Look. They came. We partied.

19:46.436 --> 19:48.772
You know, they left.
We played cards. We crashed.

19:48.939 --> 19:50.774
When we woke up,
Andreas wasn't there,

19:50.941 --> 19:53.026
and we waited for him,
he didn't come back.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.028
That's not so hard, is it?

19:55.195 --> 19:57.155
Who the fuck are you?

19:57.322 --> 19:59.867
Walking in here,
telling people what to do.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.619
I told you, you and Destiny,

20:02.786 --> 20:04.621
you can both go
and fuck yourselves.

20:04.788 --> 20:07.040
Destiny figured out
that Milan is involved.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.459
Yeah? How'd she do that?

20:09.626 --> 20:11.461
I don't know, but she went
after him last night.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.714
You better put a muzzle
on that bitch, otherwise...

20:13.881 --> 20:15.924
Come on! I'm already taking
serious heat from Milan.

20:16.091 --> 20:18.218
Alright?
He's gonna come after all of us

20:18.385 --> 20:20.387
if we don't get
our shit straight.

20:21.680 --> 20:23.515
Yeah. "Our shit."

20:23.682 --> 20:25.517
Yeah.

20:25.684 --> 20:30.314
I'm calling the shots now,
so you and your problems...

20:31.899 --> 20:34.151
You need to step the fuck away.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.324
Health, youth, and vitality
are essential,

20:40.490 --> 20:42.326
as is a strong mind.

20:42.492 --> 20:44.578
You don't want
your prodigious intellect

20:44.745 --> 20:47.623
uploaded into a cortex
with insufficient capacity.

20:48.624 --> 20:51.084
What's that fucking
brown nose up to?

20:51.251 --> 20:53.378
Quiet.

20:54.379 --> 20:56.882
You wouldn't be bullshitting me,
now would you, Johann?

20:57.049 --> 20:59.009
'Cause we know
how that plays out.

20:59.176 --> 21:01.011
Olivia, we've been over this.

21:01.178 --> 21:03.221
Game recognise game, homie.
What's your hustle?

21:03.388 --> 21:06.058
A successful outcome
is in our mutual best interests.

21:06.224 --> 21:08.060
Whatever the fuck that means.

21:08.226 --> 21:09.853
I cannot stress
strongly enough

21:10.020 --> 21:13.607
how important it is
that you find an upir host.

21:13.774 --> 21:15.192
You stand a far better chance

21:15.359 --> 21:16.902
of reducing
neural transfer rejection.

21:17.069 --> 21:18.320
What's that?

21:18.487 --> 21:20.322
Nothing you need worry about
if you listen to my instructions

21:20.489 --> 21:21.865
to the letter.

21:22.032 --> 21:24.242
- But where are you gonna find...
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

21:24.409 --> 21:27.287
Not me. You.
I'll do the transfer procedure.

21:27.454 --> 21:29.581
But you're going to find
your own host.

21:29.748 --> 21:31.583
And you're gonna
have to move fast.

21:31.750 --> 21:34.419
You're gonna be trying
to find a viable candidate...

21:37.005 --> 21:38.840
..from a demographic
that's been ravaged

21:39.007 --> 21:40.634
by disease
and homicidal violence

21:40.801 --> 21:42.344
and whose already small number

21:42.511 --> 21:44.346
is certainly dropping
precipitously.

21:45.973 --> 21:48.225
I don't know any upirs.

21:48.392 --> 21:50.227
I don't even like upirs.

21:50.394 --> 21:53.480
And I'm sure I needn't mention
that because of your condition,

21:53.647 --> 21:56.358
it would behoove you
to get on it

21:56.525 --> 21:59.027
sooner rather than later.

21:59.194 --> 22:02.030
Sooner rather...
Sooner rather than later.

22:02.197 --> 22:05.117
Got it. It... Sooner...

22:07.202 --> 22:09.454
Where am I gonna find
an upir that fits the bill?

22:09.621 --> 22:11.456
You gotta know somebody.

22:11.623 --> 22:15.419
Hey, remember that guy you used
to cheat on your husband with?

22:15.585 --> 22:17.421
Norman? He's dead.

22:17.587 --> 22:19.381
Not Norman.

22:19.548 --> 22:21.675
Guy you were cheating on
both J.R. and Norman with,

22:21.842 --> 22:23.969
if one can be said to be
cheating on the man

22:24.136 --> 22:25.679
that one's already cheating
on one's husband with.

22:25.846 --> 22:27.681
Benson Charles.

22:27.848 --> 22:30.183
I had all three of them
dancing my tune.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.185
Ended badly.

22:32.352 --> 22:34.187
Caught that fucker
cheating on me.

22:34.354 --> 22:37.315
Got to let that go, girl.
Water under the bridge.

22:37.482 --> 22:41.153
Maybe. Might even get
a good laugh out of it.

22:41.319 --> 22:45.365
How I found lipstick
on his drawers.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.868
Cocksucker red.

22:48.869 --> 22:51.872
Cocksucker red?

22:54.374 --> 22:55.876
That's funny.

22:58.670 --> 22:59.796
Oh.

23:02.466 --> 23:04.801
I should get one of those.

23:04.968 --> 23:06.887
And then I ask him,
"What happened to Shandor

23:07.054 --> 23:09.056
and all those other people?"
and he tries to tell me,

23:09.222 --> 23:11.600
"Maybe work was slow and Shandor
gave him a few days off."

23:11.767 --> 23:14.311
And when he saw that that wasn't
sticking, he said, "Hey.

23:14.478 --> 23:16.313
"We're Gypsies. We disappear.
That's what we're good at."

23:16.480 --> 23:19.399
And I said, "Yeah. Maybe you're
good at being full of shit."

23:19.566 --> 23:21.109
Andreas is dead. All those
other people are missing.

23:21.276 --> 23:23.111
And they expect us not to
notice. What the fuck?

23:23.278 --> 23:25.197
Hey, babe.

23:28.283 --> 23:30.035
Hi, girls.

23:31.036 --> 23:33.622
I'm just here
for my bowling stuff.

23:34.790 --> 23:36.792
There it is.

23:37.876 --> 23:39.836
Baj...

23:40.003 --> 23:41.421
Sit.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.092
OK.

23:53.642 --> 23:55.477
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- Yeah. I know.

23:55.644 --> 23:59.815
- You told me at the funeral.
- Oh, yeah. I still am.

23:59.981 --> 24:01.817
Thank you.

24:01.983 --> 24:04.444
I just wish I was there
with him at the end, you know.

24:04.611 --> 24:06.488
But at least he was surrounded

24:06.655 --> 24:08.490
by his friends
having fun, right?

24:08.657 --> 24:09.950
Yeah.

24:10.117 --> 24:11.701
What kind of fun?

24:13.286 --> 24:17.249
Uh... Roman brought a stripper.

24:18.250 --> 24:19.835
I thought Roman wasn't there.

24:20.001 --> 24:22.963
Yeah. That's right. He wasn't.

24:23.130 --> 24:24.923
So how many strippers
were there?

24:26.675 --> 24:28.426
Uh...

24:29.427 --> 24:30.637
Strippers...

24:30.804 --> 24:32.681
Peter said three.

24:33.682 --> 24:36.017
Three. That's it.

24:36.184 --> 24:37.477
Three's a lot of strippers.

24:37.644 --> 24:40.313
Yeah. There were two.

24:40.480 --> 24:42.315
Two...two were there.

24:42.482 --> 24:44.609
But then one left
and then another one came back.

24:44.776 --> 24:46.611
Two...two more came back.

24:46.778 --> 24:50.240
So what about this sex tape
everyone's been talking about?

24:52.659 --> 24:54.744
Who...who told you that? How
did you find out about that?

24:54.911 --> 24:56.955
I heard you whispering about it
on the phone the other night

24:57.122 --> 24:58.957
with one of your
asshole buddies.

24:59.124 --> 25:02.502
Look, it was
a home movie kind of thing.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.504
What did Andreas
have to do with it?

25:04.671 --> 25:07.507
Was it like a porn thing
with the strippers or something?

25:07.674 --> 25:10.218
- I don't know.
- Was Andreas in it?

25:10.385 --> 25:12.470
I don't know. I didn't see it.
I just heard about it.

25:12.637 --> 25:14.431
When was the last time
you saw Andreas?

25:14.598 --> 25:15.974
- At the funeral.
- Alive.

25:16.141 --> 25:17.851
At the party. At the party.

25:18.018 --> 25:19.853
And then he must have gotten up
before I...

25:20.020 --> 25:22.105
..before I woke up,
'cause I didn't see him.

25:22.272 --> 25:25.192
So, I... Babe, I'm sorry.
I got to go to the toilet.

25:25.358 --> 25:29.196
Yeah, you go to the toilet.

25:34.492 --> 25:35.994
Andreas made his choices.

25:36.161 --> 25:38.538
I knew what I was getting
with him, but I just thought...

25:38.705 --> 25:41.291
..we would have
a little more time.

25:45.045 --> 25:46.880
It's weird,
but the worst part of this

25:47.047 --> 25:49.424
is knowing that Peter
is lying to me.

25:51.176 --> 25:53.511
Well, you guys were so close.

25:54.512 --> 25:57.807
Well, we shared everything
together. Our whole lives.

25:59.559 --> 26:01.561
Us against the world.

26:09.361 --> 26:11.196
When can I see you again?

26:11.363 --> 26:13.073
Soon, I hope.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.327
You are coming back, right?

26:18.912 --> 26:21.998
Where is your friend Aitor?
I'd like to meet him.

26:22.165 --> 26:26.127
He's probably out on runs.
I think you'd like him.

26:26.294 --> 26:28.129
I know I would.

26:28.296 --> 26:31.258
Well, then you'll just have to
come back and meet him yourself.

26:34.511 --> 26:37.555
Just promise
you won't disappear.

26:46.606 --> 26:49.317
You're a blessing
to us all, Shelley.

26:49.484 --> 26:53.863
God loves you, especially.
Never forget that.

27:17.512 --> 27:19.973
I only got a few minutes.
I'm late for a board meeting.

27:20.140 --> 27:22.142
What's up?

27:23.768 --> 27:26.938
I'm gonna tell Destiny
the truth. All of it.

27:28.940 --> 27:30.942
We've already discussed this.

27:32.152 --> 27:33.987
You can't do that.
It's not an option.

27:34.154 --> 27:36.239
I don't care. I'm sick of lying,
and she's gonna find out anyway.

27:36.406 --> 27:37.866
- Peter?
- No.

27:38.033 --> 27:40.035
- You've got to trust me on this.
- No. I'm done.

27:42.162 --> 27:43.997
OK, you do what you want,

27:44.164 --> 27:46.875
but don't drag me into this hole
you're digging yourself into.

27:50.128 --> 27:52.130
You're gonna lose her.
You know that, right?

28:16.529 --> 28:18.156
- Mrs Charles?
- Yes?

28:18.323 --> 28:19.949
Olivia Godfrey.

28:20.116 --> 28:22.494
Ben and I were friends
many years ago.

28:23.745 --> 28:26.373
I'm afraid the wake
was yesterday.

28:27.457 --> 28:30.543
- What?
- Yesterday.

28:31.586 --> 28:34.464
Well, but here you are. No sense
standing out in the cold.

28:34.631 --> 28:37.550
Please. Do come in.

28:41.304 --> 28:44.265
I was just putting up a kettle.
Would you like some tea?

28:45.433 --> 28:47.227
A wake?

28:49.270 --> 28:52.148
Benson had quite a few
female friends.

28:52.315 --> 28:54.317
It was a weakness of his.

28:55.735 --> 28:58.988
But we all have
our imperfections.

28:59.155 --> 29:01.282
It's what makes us what we are.

29:02.325 --> 29:05.328
And what we are
is very much the same.

29:05.495 --> 29:07.705
Oh, I'd already guessed that.

29:07.872 --> 29:11.668
Benson's taste in the ladies
ran exclusively to upir.

29:11.835 --> 29:13.336
Please.

29:15.463 --> 29:17.882
I'm actually going to miss
his lame alibis

29:18.049 --> 29:21.511
and dumb excuses for all his
various trysts and liaisons.

29:21.678 --> 29:23.930
It was rather entertaining.

29:24.097 --> 29:26.850
This one's a keeper. We're done.

29:27.016 --> 29:28.435
Not so fast.

29:28.601 --> 29:30.645
I'm sorry?

29:31.646 --> 29:34.023
Would you mind telling me
how Ben died?

29:34.190 --> 29:36.860
Oh, ironically, Ben was
supposed to go to Toronto

29:37.026 --> 29:39.279
for some sort of
emergency conference

29:39.446 --> 29:42.782
about this dreadful surge
in upir-on-upir violence.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.784
Ironically, Ben was murdered

29:44.951 --> 29:46.786
by one of those things
on the way to the airport.

29:46.953 --> 29:48.913
Dear God, no.

29:49.080 --> 29:50.915
To be honest,
my doctor's surprised

29:51.082 --> 29:53.376
I even survived
the shock of losing him.

29:53.543 --> 29:55.628
Oh. You know
how those shrinks are.

29:55.795 --> 29:58.923
Anything to keep you coming back
for those 45-minute hours.

29:59.090 --> 30:01.843
Oh, it was my cardiologist.

30:02.010 --> 30:06.598
Congenital heart defect.
Rare in upirs, apparently. Hmm.

30:06.764 --> 30:08.766
Well, I could go at any minute.

30:12.061 --> 30:13.897
I do hope they find some answers
up in Toronto.

30:14.063 --> 30:15.773
This really is getting scary.

30:15.940 --> 30:17.817
Well, who was all gonna be
at this gathering?

30:17.984 --> 30:20.236
Oh, all the heavy hitters
in our tribe.

30:21.237 --> 30:25.658
Invitation's around here
somewhere with all the details.

30:27.911 --> 30:32.123
Mmm. You really are
an inspiration.

30:32.290 --> 30:35.043
All alone, and so very brave.

30:35.210 --> 30:39.672
Hmm. Well, Ben would have
expected nothing less of me.

30:39.839 --> 30:40.840
Oh.

31:19.212 --> 31:21.047
<i>911.
What is your emergency?</i>

31:21.214 --> 31:23.675
<i>There's a man
on the sidewalk passed out.</i>

31:23.841 --> 31:26.094
<i>- I don't think he's breathing.</i>
<i>- What's the address?</i>

31:26.261 --> 31:28.513
<i>Nestor building on Hope Road.
I don't know the number.</i>

31:28.680 --> 31:31.474
<i>Paramedics are on
their way. Is the man injured?</i>

31:31.641 --> 31:33.601
<i>All I know is
he won't wake up.</i>

31:35.186 --> 31:37.605
Could you play it again, please?

31:44.028 --> 31:46.447
<i>There's a man
on the sidewalk passed out.</i>

31:46.614 --> 31:48.283
<i>I don't think he's breathing.</i>

32:09.554 --> 32:11.389
Hello.

32:11.556 --> 32:13.600
What's the eminent Dr Pryce
got you working on these days,

32:13.766 --> 32:15.602
if you don't mind me asking?

32:15.768 --> 32:17.937
Amphibious adaptation and...

32:18.104 --> 32:20.356
..breeding habits
in estuarine environments.

32:20.523 --> 32:22.984
Interesting. Which ones?

32:23.151 --> 32:25.653
All of them.

32:26.654 --> 32:28.489
Why?

32:28.656 --> 32:31.034
Because Dr Pryce told me to.

32:32.952 --> 32:34.787
Where have you been, anyway?

32:34.954 --> 32:38.458
I've been out with the flu,
but I'm...I'm better now.

32:41.002 --> 32:43.046
You shouldn't have come back in
if you're still sick.

32:43.212 --> 32:45.256
I'm not contagious,
and Pryce needed me

32:45.423 --> 32:47.258
to gather some data
for the quarterly meeting.

32:47.425 --> 32:49.427
Yeah, well...

32:50.428 --> 32:53.348
..take your non-contagious
contagion elsewhere, would you?

32:58.978 --> 33:01.314
That growth in this sector

33:01.481 --> 33:03.316
has exceeded our projections

33:03.483 --> 33:05.610
for three
of the last four quarters

33:05.777 --> 33:08.988
and is a full 27%
above real revenue

33:09.155 --> 33:11.532
for the same quarter
of the last year.

33:11.699 --> 33:16.454
After a standard
cost of materials rise of 3%,

33:16.621 --> 33:18.247
an admirable 19%...

33:18.414 --> 33:21.292
Something troubling you?
You look unhappy.

33:21.459 --> 33:24.087
If I want a shoulder to cry on,
I'll call you.

33:25.129 --> 33:26.964
Peter got himself jammed up

33:27.131 --> 33:29.342
with some idiot Gypsy friends
of his.

33:29.509 --> 33:31.719
I never understood
what you saw in that boy.

33:31.886 --> 33:34.138
- Unless...
- Unless what?

33:35.139 --> 33:36.474
Well, I've always wondered

33:36.641 --> 33:38.393
if your relationship
was more than...

33:39.394 --> 33:41.729
He is a very handsome young man,
is he not?

33:41.896 --> 33:46.109
That's way out
of line, Pryce. Way off base.

33:46.275 --> 33:47.610
No need
to get defensive.

33:47.777 --> 33:49.112
It's not
an illogical assumption.

33:49.278 --> 33:50.905
Well,
it's a wrong assumption.

33:51.072 --> 33:53.866
You make it sound like I'm
accusing you of a high crime.

33:59.664 --> 34:00.957
Is my mother dead yet?

34:01.124 --> 34:03.334
Not since the last time
you asked me, yesterday.

34:03.501 --> 34:05.920
..pharmaceuticals
that Godfrey Industries

34:06.087 --> 34:08.339
has pushed through
clinical trials...

34:09.590 --> 34:12.385
It'll be strange to live in
a world without Olivia in it.

34:12.552 --> 34:15.346
..developing products
portfolio will be the key

34:15.513 --> 34:17.764
to creating awareness
in our customers

34:17.931 --> 34:21.601
that there is relief available
for those diseases

34:21.768 --> 34:23.603
that previously
they may have been unaware

34:23.771 --> 34:25.313
they were suffering from.

34:26.733 --> 34:29.110
It should be noted that 38%

34:29.277 --> 34:33.114
of our cumulative expenditures
for this quarter

34:33.281 --> 34:35.699
have been attributed
to marketing.

35:17.033 --> 35:19.243
Roman, for the love of Christ,
get down!

35:22.455 --> 35:25.082
Drop your weapon!

35:46.604 --> 35:48.356
Well, well, well.

35:52.360 --> 35:54.195
Clear surgical suite four, stat,

35:54.362 --> 35:56.948
and have the full-clearance
emergency OR team standing by,

35:57.114 --> 35:58.950
and the consciousness
transfer apparatus

35:59.116 --> 36:00.576
wheeled in and booted up.

36:00.743 --> 36:02.286
Move! Time is short!

36:13.506 --> 36:15.633
Jesus fucking Christ.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.559
The body was depleting
blood supply

36:24.725 --> 36:27.270
and draining brain function,
what's left of it.

36:27.436 --> 36:30.398
If I can keep his frontal lobe
viable long enough,

36:30.565 --> 36:32.400
by pumping super-oxygenated
blood through it,

36:32.567 --> 36:35.111
we could get a glimpse
into his short-term memory.

36:35.278 --> 36:39.031
Increase blood flow to 1,000
cc's per minute, 1 amp epi,

36:39.198 --> 36:41.158
and drop the pump temp
to 34 Centigrade.

36:41.325 --> 36:44.245
Capture venous return,
oxygenate it, then send it back.

36:47.582 --> 36:49.834
Goddamn it, Blinsky, do it!

37:13.190 --> 37:15.276
He said he was off this week
with the flu, but this is...

37:15.443 --> 37:17.278
No, no, no, no.
Not the flu.

37:17.445 --> 37:19.405
Do you smell that?

37:19.572 --> 37:22.033
The rotten egg smell? Sulfur.

37:22.199 --> 37:24.035
I detected that earlier,
in the boardroom.

37:24.201 --> 37:27.538
Spivak must have gotten his
clutches on our young friend.

37:27.705 --> 37:31.125
I can capture the electrical
output of Trevor's visual cortex

37:31.292 --> 37:33.920
to an enhanced computer visual
system I've been developing.

37:36.380 --> 37:38.215
The technology's
still in alpha testing,

37:38.382 --> 37:40.468
so it'll be a crap shoot.

37:48.309 --> 37:50.144
Damn it. It's just as I feared.

37:50.311 --> 37:52.939
Trevor's brain is no longer
capable of disambiguous thought.

37:53.105 --> 37:56.692
Now, what's needed is a healthy
mind to boost the signal,

37:56.859 --> 37:58.694
to function as a router,
of sorts,

37:58.861 --> 38:00.613
that will amplify
the neural impulses,

38:00.780 --> 38:02.531
giving clarity to
whatever's left of memory.

38:02.698 --> 38:05.117
- I'll do it.
- No. The procedure is not without risk.

38:05.284 --> 38:07.119
We'll use a janitor or some
other undocumented worker,

38:07.286 --> 38:08.746
in case of malfunction.

38:08.913 --> 38:11.415
There's no time for that, doc.
Hook me up.

38:16.253 --> 38:18.297
OK. Let's do it.

38:56.585 --> 38:58.004
You like?

38:58.170 --> 38:59.463
Hmm.

38:59.630 --> 39:01.382
Built to last.

39:01.549 --> 39:04.802
Legs from here to there,

39:04.969 --> 39:07.555
pleasantly conjoining

39:07.722 --> 39:10.349
where they conjoin.

39:16.981 --> 39:19.025
Real Deal Holyfield.

39:19.191 --> 39:21.485
Is that all your Neanderthal
gender can think about?

39:21.652 --> 39:23.029
What about her mind?

39:23.195 --> 39:24.864
I thought it was
gonna be your mind.

39:25.031 --> 39:26.741
This is just the vessel
to hold it in.

39:26.907 --> 39:29.952
It's just plain disrespectful,
the way you're objectifying her.

39:30.119 --> 39:31.829
So is this
little slice of heaven

39:31.996 --> 39:33.581
coming home with us or what?

39:33.748 --> 39:35.249
Are you serious?

39:35.416 --> 39:38.544
She could hire herself out as
a can opener with that overbite.

40:16.832 --> 40:19.752
Hold that thought for a moment.
Hold it! Hold it.

40:26.801 --> 40:28.094
Burst suppression alpha coma.

40:30.387 --> 40:34.058
Intermittent delta.
Approaching flatline.

40:35.559 --> 40:37.394
- You're losing him.
- I can see that, Blinsky.

40:37.561 --> 40:39.146
You idiot!
I'm standing right here.

40:39.313 --> 40:41.065
He's gone.

40:46.237 --> 40:47.696
Fuck.

40:52.076 --> 40:54.328
Wait, one eye's operating

40:54.495 --> 40:56.539
in the complete absence
of electro-cerebral activity.

40:56.705 --> 40:58.541
I'm gonna need to do
an immediate enucleation.

40:58.707 --> 41:01.127
Blinsky, get me a number four
ocular retraction speculum.

41:01.293 --> 41:03.212
They're all in the primary lab.
Shall I go get them?

41:03.379 --> 41:05.214
No, no. There's not enough time.
Goddamn it.

41:05.381 --> 41:07.383
Why do I have to do
everything myself?

41:17.726 --> 41:20.855
Out, vile jelly.

41:31.532 --> 41:33.450
Goddamn you, Spivak.

41:37.288 --> 41:39.331
<i>Johann Pryce.</i>

41:39.498 --> 41:41.709
<i>Oh, you're looking well,
which is most unfortunate.</i>

41:41.876 --> 41:43.711
<i>Do you know in all the years</i>

41:43.878 --> 41:45.713
<i>we lived in the same
shitty little town,</i>

41:45.880 --> 41:47.756
<i>never once did you invite me
over to your lab?</i>

41:47.923 --> 41:50.050
<i>But then, you were
a world-renowned scientist,</i>

41:50.217 --> 41:52.553
<i>and I, a humble country doctor.</i>

41:52.720 --> 41:54.555
You fucked up, Spivak.

41:54.722 --> 41:56.807
You got a lot of
my board members killed,

41:56.974 --> 41:58.893
but you missed Pryce and me.

41:59.059 --> 42:00.936
<i>Oh, well, thank you
for your clarification</i>

42:01.103 --> 42:03.522
<i>of the completely obvious,
you obnoxious little turd.</i>

42:03.689 --> 42:05.524
I've mapped your genome.

42:05.691 --> 42:07.526
I know everything about you

42:07.693 --> 42:09.612
down to your base
nucleic couplings.

42:09.778 --> 42:11.906
<i>Then you get two gold stars
next to your name</i>

42:12.072 --> 42:14.366
<i>and can be the hall monitor
these last days.</i>

42:14.533 --> 42:18.078
You're a sulfur-based life form.
Unique? Yes.

42:18.245 --> 42:21.457
Capable of surviving under
the harshest conditions? Yes.

42:21.624 --> 42:23.459
But an Earth-based life form

42:23.626 --> 42:26.420
made of flesh and blood
and quite mortal.

42:26.587 --> 42:28.797
<i>Circle gets the square. Bravo.</i>

42:28.964 --> 42:32.509
We're gonna find you, Spivak,
and I'm gonna kill you.

42:32.676 --> 42:35.221
You sick Jörmungandr fuck.

42:35.387 --> 42:37.223
<i>Oh, good luck with that,
golden boy.</i>

42:37.389 --> 42:40.226
<i>Oh, and by the way,
thank you for fathering Nadia.</i>

42:40.392 --> 42:44.230
<i>She has been very, very useful to me.
You have no idea.</i>

42:44.396 --> 42:47.358
<i>And nice facility
you got here, Johann.</i>

42:47.524 --> 42:49.902
<i>Trevor, mm-hm,
gave me a cook's tour</i>

42:50.069 --> 42:52.029
<i>before he met
with your board of directors.</i>

43:01.705 --> 43:04.166
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

43:05.167 --> 43:07.127
Well, my, uh...
my fellow upirs, thank you.

43:07.294 --> 43:09.505
Welcome. Thank you for coming.

43:10.506 --> 43:12.258
Who is that?

43:12.424 --> 43:14.176
Norville Knox.

43:14.343 --> 43:16.136
Revolutionised haemodialysis.

43:16.303 --> 43:18.138
Created synthetic
immunoglobulin.

43:18.305 --> 43:21.016
Holds dozens of patents.
He made a fortune in med tech.

43:21.183 --> 43:23.310
Worth north of a billion.

43:24.311 --> 43:27.731
What I wouldn't do to get my hands
on a piece of that action.

43:27.898 --> 43:29.984
..nor is it contained
to North America.

43:30.985 --> 43:34.405
Five upir killed in Sydney,
Australia. Last three days.

43:34.571 --> 43:37.491
14 in Tokyo. 44 in Kuala Lumpur.
Hundreds more.

43:37.658 --> 43:41.662
Moscow, Madrid, Tangiers,
Montevideo, Mexico City.

43:41.829 --> 43:44.373
It is a global problem,

43:44.540 --> 43:46.750
and it's accelerating
exponentially.

43:46.917 --> 43:50.296
We need to determine
how and why.

43:50.462 --> 43:52.298
It would appear

43:52.464 --> 43:55.551
that we are falling sick
and devouring our own.

43:56.552 --> 43:58.721
I have no explanation
for any of this...

43:59.722 --> 44:03.017
..since no specimens have been
properly examined, thus far.

44:03.183 --> 44:05.185
So I am at a bit
of a standstill.

44:06.437 --> 44:09.440
If you had a big cock
and his money...

44:09.606 --> 44:11.317
I'd rule the world.

44:11.483 --> 44:13.402
Hmm.

44:23.495 --> 44:24.872
Blinsky, I need you to run

44:25.039 --> 44:26.498
the pattern recognition
comparisons

44:26.665 --> 44:28.250
against NOAA satellite images.

44:28.417 --> 44:30.044
That rooftop could be anywhere.

44:30.210 --> 44:31.879
Anywhere it's winter.

44:32.046 --> 44:33.881
Which, at this time of year,

44:34.048 --> 44:36.925
narrows it down
to Northern America, Canada,

44:37.092 --> 44:39.136
Northern Europe, Russia,
Mongolia and...

44:39.303 --> 44:41.680
I know where it's winter.

44:43.182 --> 44:45.225
Oh, and, Blinsky,
before you get started,

44:45.392 --> 44:47.227
cancel my dinner with Randolph.

44:47.394 --> 44:50.397
And please send flowers
along with my apologies.

44:50.564 --> 44:52.608
It's going to be a long night.

44:56.528 --> 45:00.199
Go home, Roman. Relax.

45:00.366 --> 45:02.409
Data still needs to be analysed.

45:02.576 --> 45:05.371
If there's anything further,
I will call you.

45:06.372 --> 45:07.831
Alright.

45:48.705 --> 45:50.207
Destiny?

46:11.186 --> 46:15.274
Well, I didn't expect
to see you again.

46:15.441 --> 46:17.609
I came to say goodbye.

46:17.776 --> 46:20.404
Yeah, that's what
you said last night

46:20.571 --> 46:22.698
before you fucked me
like a honey badger.

46:24.491 --> 46:27.453
I thought we could part civilly,
like adults.

46:27.619 --> 46:29.913
- But...
- So what does that mean?

46:30.080 --> 46:31.915
"I'm leaving"

46:32.082 --> 46:34.543
or "Please, Daddy,
fuck me some more"?

46:35.878 --> 46:39.047
I wish I'd never touched you
in the first place.

46:39.214 --> 46:41.091
I hate myself for it.

46:41.258 --> 46:43.677
You should,
but yet here you are,

46:43.844 --> 46:45.888
showing up looking for seconds.

46:47.097 --> 46:48.932
OK, so what about you?

46:49.099 --> 46:51.143
You claim to love Miranda

46:51.310 --> 46:54.313
and care more than anything
for the child you fathered,

46:54.480 --> 46:56.482
but you carry on with me...

46:57.483 --> 46:59.026
..like they don't exist.

46:59.193 --> 47:04.239
Yeah, well, as far
as I'm concerned, we're done.

47:04.406 --> 47:06.241
I'm done.

47:06.408 --> 47:08.702
Yeah. Over and out.

47:10.579 --> 47:12.748
By the way, I hate roses.

47:12.915 --> 47:15.709
They're only good for covering
up the smell of the dead.

47:18.295 --> 47:20.005
Fuck. What does she want?

47:20.172 --> 47:23.675
Let's just be quiet.
Maybe she'll go away.

47:33.352 --> 47:34.978
Where the fuck is Peter?

47:35.145 --> 47:37.356
I thought he was with you.
He's not here.

47:37.523 --> 47:39.775
- He's been hiding from me.
- Search the place.

47:39.942 --> 47:41.693
He's not here.

47:45.697 --> 47:48.450
You know he's been lying
and lying to cover for his lies?

47:48.617 --> 47:50.452
Ever since he came back
to Hemlock Grove

47:50.619 --> 47:52.454
and you two dusted off
your little sister act.

47:52.621 --> 47:54.456
- Not my problem.
- It is your fucking problem.

47:54.623 --> 47:56.166
I know you're involved,
and I want to know how.

47:56.333 --> 47:57.834
You're out of your mind.

47:58.001 --> 47:59.670
What were the names
of the strippers you sent?

47:59.836 --> 48:01.338
- What?
- I want to talk to them.

48:01.505 --> 48:03.090
I have no idea what the fuck
you're talking about,

48:03.257 --> 48:04.883
but you're starting
to piss me off.

48:05.050 --> 48:07.761
So why don't you turn yourself
around and go the fuck home?

48:08.929 --> 48:11.181
Tell me how Andreas' body
was found.

48:11.348 --> 48:12.891
How should I know?

48:13.976 --> 48:16.144
There's a guy on the sidewalk.

48:16.311 --> 48:18.438
Passed out.

48:18.605 --> 48:20.607
I don't think he's breathing.

48:24.778 --> 48:27.364
What did Peter...
What did Peter tell you?

48:27.531 --> 48:30.784
It was you.
You were the voice on the tape.

48:30.951 --> 48:32.369
- What did he say?!
- Nothing.

48:32.536 --> 48:34.663
He was covering your ass.
I figured it out all by myself.

48:34.830 --> 48:36.373
What did this guy
on the pavement

48:36.540 --> 48:38.000
who wasn't breathing look like?

48:38.166 --> 48:39.751
Did he look like Andreas?
Did he look like Andreas

48:39.918 --> 48:41.670
with a fucking bullet
in the back of his head?

48:41.837 --> 48:43.380
Was the reason
Andreas wasn't breathing

48:43.547 --> 48:45.048
because of you,
you fucking piece of shit?

48:45.215 --> 48:47.050
Fuck it, and fuck you!

48:47.217 --> 48:49.386
Andreas was too stupid
to be allowed to live.

48:49.553 --> 48:51.680
All those people died
because of him.

48:51.847 --> 48:54.224
- Bullshit.
- Have you seen that guy Shandor lately?

48:54.391 --> 48:56.226
Do you know why they
closed down the warehouse?

48:56.393 --> 48:58.145
All of them dead
because of Andreas.

48:58.312 --> 48:59.646
Lies. Lies.

48:59.813 --> 49:02.399
I didn't have anything to do
with his death.

49:02.566 --> 49:04.484
- Peter did.
- No. You're lying!

49:04.651 --> 49:06.486
- Andreas wasn't like that.
- He didn't have a choice.

49:06.653 --> 49:08.488
It was that or more people
were gonna die.

49:08.655 --> 49:10.157
Peter was trying to protect you!

49:10.324 --> 49:11.783
I'm not fucking
listening to you!

49:11.950 --> 49:13.785
- I fucking hate you.
- Peter was protecting you.

49:13.952 --> 49:16.204
I was just trying to help him
out, so don't come into my house

49:16.371 --> 49:18.206
and walk over me
with your "fuck-you" shoes,

49:18.373 --> 49:20.208
and tell me what I did
or didn't do

49:20.375 --> 49:23.086
to your lowlife,
piece of shit boyfriend.

49:44.149 --> 49:48.362
Roman, please. We've got
to take her to a hospital.

49:54.993 --> 49:57.287
Roman, please.

50:03.502 --> 50:05.128
Call 911.

50:08.507 --> 50:10.008
Hurry, please.

50:17.140 --> 50:18.642
Roman.

50:22.020 --> 50:23.522
What are you doing?

50:32.781 --> 50:34.700
How could you?

50:38.453 --> 50:39.996
How could you?!

50:44.126 --> 50:46.670
Will you kill me too?

51:21.913 --> 51:24.499
"A fire devours before him,

51:24.666 --> 51:28.795
"and around him a tempest rages.

51:29.963 --> 51:32.507
"He summons the heavens above

51:32.674 --> 51:36.970
"and the Earth,
that he may judge his people.

51:38.054 --> 51:40.932
""Gather to me
these consecrated people

51:41.099 --> 51:45.395
""who made a covenant

"And the heavens proclaim
his righteousness,

51:51.234 --> 51:53.612
"for he is a God of justice."
