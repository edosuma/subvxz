WEBVTT

00:21.166 --> 00:22.458
Stop!

00:26.166 --> 00:28.291
We have a new student
in class today.

00:28.375 --> 00:31.083
His name's Robert, and he's
just moved here from St.
Louis.

00:32.667 --> 00:35.709
Since he's coming on late,
he'll need a study buddy.

00:37.166 --> 00:38.625
Any volunteers?

00:40.458 --> 00:42.166
(Elliot)
'Hmm?'

00:43.709 --> 00:46.458
That's swell,
Norman, thank you.

00:46.542 --> 00:47.792
Now, uh..

00:47.875 --> 00:49.125
...I gather you're all curious

00:49.208 --> 00:51.875
what brings Robert
to Philadelphia, so..

00:51.959 --> 00:53.917
...Robert?

00:54.625 --> 00:56.125
'Go ahead, son.'

01:03.542 --> 01:07.000
My daddy's got a new
job, we had to move.

01:08.458 --> 01:09.792
He's in a band.

01:11.041 --> 01:13.875
There's a club here
that wants him to play.

01:13.959 --> 01:15.792
I got one of his records.

01:18.709 --> 01:21.417
That's him there.
He plays drums.

01:21.500 --> 01:23.625
Is he gonna be
on Bandstand?

01:23.709 --> 01:25.667
Does he know Perry Como?

01:25.750 --> 01:27.500
I don't think so, but..

01:27.583 --> 01:29.166
...he jammed with
Louis Armstrong once.

01:32.125 --> 01:34.834
Mr. Garvey,
if Norman doesn't want to be

01:34.917 --> 01:36.458
his study buddy...I will.

01:36.542 --> 01:38.291
No way! You didn't
raise your hand.

01:38.375 --> 01:39.750
Neither did you, fatso.

01:39.834 --> 01:41.166
Now, now, there's plenty of time

01:41.250 --> 01:42.458
for everyone to
get to know Robert.

01:45.750 --> 01:47.750
Good morning, children.

01:49.208 --> 01:50.333
(male #1)
'Sorry to interrupt,
Mr. Garvey'

01:50.417 --> 01:52.834
but there's been a...a mix-up.

01:52.917 --> 01:55.458
Robert, get your things
and come with me.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.583
What's all this?

02:00.667 --> 02:02.458
- What's happening?
- The boy's at the wrong
school.

02:02.542 --> 02:05.417
- I don't understand.
- Elliot, look at him.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.750
What's it matter?
He gets along well--

02:06.834 --> 02:08.208
It matters plenty.

02:08.291 --> 02:09.625
Now, don't go making trouble.

02:09.709 --> 02:11.667
I don't wanna
lose my best teacher.

02:11.750 --> 02:13.208
Robert.

03:13.208 --> 03:14.750
Name's Howard Garvey.

03:14.834 --> 03:16.500
He's seeing this
court-ordered shrink.

03:16.583 --> 03:18.208
Of course they get to
talk about his father.

03:18.291 --> 03:19.417
And?

03:19.500 --> 03:21.667
The guy always heard
his dad was a drunk

03:21.750 --> 03:23.750
deserted the family.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.375
Find out something new?

03:26.458 --> 03:31.792
Yeah, the truth is he was
killed
in Fairmount Park, 1953.

03:31.875 --> 03:33.709
Huh. So why the cover story?

03:33.792 --> 03:36.333
Oh, he's in my office, Lil.
You can ask him yourself.

03:36.417 --> 03:37.542
Oh.

03:37.625 --> 03:39.166
I'll, uh, grab Scotty.

03:48.083 --> 03:50.959
- You can't be here.
- Nice to see you too, Lil.

03:51.041 --> 03:53.291
Yeah, you can't be here.

03:53.375 --> 03:54.959
I just...wanna talk.

03:55.041 --> 03:56.291
Christina.

04:06.542 --> 04:08.458
Boss has something.

04:11.583 --> 04:13.458
(Howard)
I don't put a lot
of stock in head doctors

04:13.542 --> 04:15.000
but I'm under orders.

04:15.083 --> 04:17.542
And this guy had to check
my family's medical history.

04:17.625 --> 04:18.834
For emotional disorders.

04:18.917 --> 04:21.667
Depression, whatever.

04:21.750 --> 04:23.083
I guess it's hereditary.

04:24.583 --> 04:27.917
Or you thought maybe
your dad had it too?

04:28.000 --> 04:28.959
Yeah.

04:29.041 --> 04:30.500
(Howard)
But if he
did..

04:30.583 --> 04:32.750
...well, that beat down
in the park got him first.

04:32.834 --> 04:36.166
Why do you think your mom
kept the murder a secret?

04:36.250 --> 04:37.875
Don't know.

04:37.959 --> 04:41.333
But the medical
examiner's report..

04:41.417 --> 04:43.000
...is clear-cut.

04:45.375 --> 04:48.500
You, um...have
an accident, Howard?

04:52.041 --> 04:53.792
No.

04:53.875 --> 04:55.041
That was me.

04:55.125 --> 04:57.375
That's why
the court-ordered doc.

04:57.458 --> 04:59.375
What does your family
say about your dad now?

04:59.458 --> 05:01.417
Called my mom for
the first time in 15 years

05:01.500 --> 05:03.291
to see if maybe dad
wasn't a bum, after all.

05:03.375 --> 05:04.500
And?

05:04.583 --> 05:07.500
Said she'd call me
back after cribbage.

05:07.583 --> 05:08.792
That was last week.

05:08.875 --> 05:12.750
- Got any siblings?
- A brother. Dean.

05:12.834 --> 05:14.083
Lost his number, long time back.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.291
I don't even know
where my dad is buried.

05:21.875 --> 05:24.208
If we do this, Howard..

05:24.291 --> 05:25.875
...we're gonna
need you around.

05:28.125 --> 05:29.458
I'm not going anywhere.

05:31.875 --> 05:33.166
Sure about that?

05:38.417 --> 05:39.709
I'm sure.

06:20.208 --> 06:22.417
We waiting for Lil?

06:22.500 --> 06:24.291
Said go ahead
without her.

06:24.375 --> 06:26.792
Elliot Garvey,
fourth grade teacher

06:26.875 --> 06:29.291
found beaten to death,
no weapon, no suspects.

06:29.375 --> 06:32.667
Car had two slashed tires,
a mile from the scene.

06:35.166 --> 06:36.709
"Next" what?

06:36.792 --> 06:40.792
They found a blade broken
off in one of the tires.

06:40.875 --> 06:43.083
There's an engraving
or part of one.

06:43.166 --> 06:45.291
'Yeah, looks like
a bird wing, letter B.'

06:45.375 --> 06:47.959
Could be military.
See if we can source that
logo.

06:48.041 --> 06:51.625
Yeah, and Garvey had a record,
marijuana possession.

06:51.709 --> 06:54.125
Busted in a raid
two months before he died.

06:54.208 --> 06:55.917
715 North 33rd.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.875
Mantua. In the 50's, that was
the other side of the tracks.

06:58.959 --> 07:00.250
Poor, and all black.

07:00.333 --> 07:02.208
So what's a white
schoolteacher doing there?

07:02.291 --> 07:03.583
Buying.

07:03.667 --> 07:06.125
And that's the secret
mom kept for 50 years?

07:06.208 --> 07:08.166
Lot of information,
not a lot done with it.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.917
Only a few interviews. Hmm.

07:11.959 --> 07:13.166
No neighborhood surveys.

07:13.250 --> 07:14.834
Looks like they stopped
working this job

07:14.917 --> 07:17.000
after a couple of weeks.

07:17.083 --> 07:19.417
So this one didn't go cold.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.917
It started that way.

07:35.583 --> 07:37.834
I knew you'd still be here.

07:37.917 --> 07:40.125
I knew you'd come find me.

07:45.125 --> 07:46.875
I'm going through
a bad breakup.

07:49.291 --> 07:50.709
I need a place
to think things out.

07:50.792 --> 07:52.917
- What's wrong with New York?
- This guy is..

07:54.709 --> 07:56.542
It's not safe in New York.

07:59.166 --> 08:00.959
I can't help you, Chris.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.875
Hey, our guy had
an arrest in Mantua.

08:05.959 --> 08:08.375
Thought we'd go
to the address.

08:08.458 --> 08:10.250
Yeah, yeah, good.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.917
- Hey.
- Hi.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.750
So, Lil, is there any way I..

08:37.333 --> 08:39.917
Looking for Renaldo Copely.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.125
We buried dad in January.

08:42.208 --> 08:44.667
'Something I can do for you?'

08:44.750 --> 08:48.250
Looking into an
old murder, 1953.

08:48.333 --> 08:49.500
Think your dad knew the guy.

08:49.583 --> 08:52.250
[scoffs]
Fifty three? You're kidding.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.417
Victim's name
was Elliot Garvey.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.625
Got pinched here
in a drug raid.

08:55.709 --> 08:56.959
You remember
anything like that?

08:57.041 --> 08:58.792
There were a lot
of raids back then.

08:58.875 --> 09:00.208
None of them legit.

09:00.291 --> 09:03.667
All these arrests
on your dad's sheet..

09:03.750 --> 09:05.291
...any of them legit?

09:05.375 --> 09:06.625
He was an activist.

09:06.709 --> 09:08.500
Got locked up every other week.

09:08.583 --> 09:09.625
Activist?

09:09.709 --> 09:11.834
Little thing
called civil rights?

09:11.917 --> 09:14.625
Your dead guy was
probably here for a meeting.

09:14.709 --> 09:16.709
Don't suppose you remember him.

09:21.625 --> 09:24.333
Didn't see a lot of
white folks back then.

09:24.417 --> 09:27.375
Ones I did...made an impression.

09:34.291 --> 09:36.000
(Renaldo)
Every train car, washroom

09:36.083 --> 09:39.750
and lunch counter is legally
segregated in the south.

09:39.834 --> 09:41.792
(Renaldo)
'So I brought
my family north.'

09:41.875 --> 09:43.250
'And up here, we found'

09:43.333 --> 09:45.834
de facto segregation.

09:45.917 --> 09:47.667
- I'm Reina.
- Elliot Garvey.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.792
- Uh, friend of Harland's.
- This country is stuck..

09:50.875 --> 09:52.583
Welcome.

09:52.667 --> 09:54.625
England and France integrated
their schools years ago.

09:54.709 --> 09:58.542
We and lots of folks are still
fighting Civil War down south.

09:58.625 --> 10:01.125
Can we, uh,
appeal to the mayor?

10:01.208 --> 10:03.125
He's like all
the politicians, Elliot.

10:03.208 --> 10:04.750
"Change must be gradual."

10:04.834 --> 10:08.166
The emancipation proclamation
was issued 90 years ago.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.667
That's gradual enough.

10:10.750 --> 10:14.166
Integration in classrooms
won't
happen unless we force it.

10:14.250 --> 10:16.291
- 'Yeah. That's right.'
- 'That's right.'

10:18.083 --> 10:19.959
What do you say, Mr. Garvey?

10:22.583 --> 10:28.500
Well, I-I, uh, don't know
about Europe or politicians..

10:28.583 --> 10:32.166
...but what I do know
is that this nice boy

10:32.250 --> 10:34.250
got kicked out of
my classroom last week

10:34.333 --> 10:35.709
and it just didn't seem right.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.667
So these drug raids
were just an excuse

10:56.750 --> 10:58.000
to break up the meetings.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.333
They never ran out of excuses.

11:00.417 --> 11:02.375
Who were the guys
taking down plates?

11:02.458 --> 11:04.917
Who you got? Cops, Klan?

11:05.000 --> 11:07.542
Most people weren't
real hot on integrating.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.917
Hmm. Any threats?

11:10.000 --> 11:12.875
Guy burning a cross
on the porch. That qualify?

11:12.959 --> 11:15.041
Well, wouldn't have
burned a cross on his porch.

11:15.125 --> 11:17.083
(female #1)
'For him, they'd have
done other things.'

11:17.166 --> 11:20.583
White man up here,
means he's a sympathizer.

11:20.667 --> 11:23.083
Made him a target, too.

11:35.500 --> 11:37.166
Close game.

11:37.250 --> 11:38.375
Ah!

11:38.458 --> 11:40.583
It's those aluminum bats.

11:40.667 --> 11:42.667
When I came up
they were all
wood.

11:42.750 --> 11:44.250
Had to work for an RBI.

11:44.333 --> 11:47.625
That's kind of what we want
to talk to you about, Dean.

11:47.709 --> 11:49.166
(Will)
'When you came up.'

11:49.250 --> 11:51.917
We're looking into
your father's death.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.083
I don't like to talk about that.

11:55.834 --> 11:58.959
- Take after your mom.
- You talked to her?

11:59.041 --> 12:00.125
Tried.

12:00.208 --> 12:01.458
Hit the retirement
home this morning

12:01.542 --> 12:03.667
but she wouldn't
come out of her room.

12:03.750 --> 12:05.542
What's the big secret, Dean?

12:05.625 --> 12:07.125
Fifty years,
what does it matter?

12:07.208 --> 12:08.875
We hear he got in
with some activists.

12:08.959 --> 12:12.667
"Activists." Right. Maybe
murdered over his involvement.

12:14.709 --> 12:16.709
You make him out
to be some kind of hero.

12:16.792 --> 12:19.792
- Took a lot of courage.
- He wasn't a hero.

12:19.875 --> 12:23.500
- Integration wasn't
important?
- Integration was a front.

12:24.917 --> 12:26.208
Front for what?

12:31.583 --> 12:34.709
(Kay)
'Dinner...'

12:34.792 --> 12:36.500
Mr. Jenkins let
the colored boy come back?

12:36.583 --> 12:40.208
- No. Shipped him off to
Emlen.
- That's rotten.

12:40.291 --> 12:43.458
First thing every morning, the
children ask where Robert went.

12:43.542 --> 12:45.000
Dean, about ready. Wash up.

12:45.083 --> 12:47.166
Already did, pop.

12:47.250 --> 12:48.917
Mm. What'd you put on this?

12:49.000 --> 12:50.333
Something I picked
up in Chinatown.

12:50.417 --> 12:53.166
- They call it soy sauce.
- Chinatown?

12:53.250 --> 12:55.375
A little adventure
never hurt anyone, hmm?

12:55.458 --> 12:56.500
Elliot.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.750
- I saw that.
- You did not. Sit down.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.875
So, Heather, you working at your
dad's soda counter this summer?

13:07.959 --> 13:09.000
Yeah, that's right.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.041
And going to the drive-in

13:10.125 --> 13:11.125
with me every Saturday night.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.333
Maybe you should work too, Dean

13:12.417 --> 13:13.959
instead of loafing
your time away.

13:14.041 --> 13:19.208
- Ma, I got baseball.
- And his trip to Washington.

13:19.291 --> 13:21.834
I can't believe you're
gonna meet Mr. Eisenhower.

13:21.917 --> 13:24.750
All I ask is that you get
a photo of you shaking his
hand.

13:24.834 --> 13:28.083
- Elliot Garvey?
- That's right.

13:28.166 --> 13:29.583
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

13:32.041 --> 13:33.792
Consider yourself served.

13:36.375 --> 13:38.375
House un-American Activities.

13:40.125 --> 13:42.417
My father was no hero.

13:43.834 --> 13:45.750
He was a communist.

13:56.041 --> 13:57.834
Alright, if Garvey
was a communist

13:57.917 --> 13:59.917
then your suspect pool
just got a deep end.

14:00.000 --> 14:02.917
Well, figured it wasn't
the most popular club.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.417
"Better dead than Red."

14:04.500 --> 14:07.000
Maybe someone
took that literally.

14:07.083 --> 14:08.417
Got subpoenaed mid-May

14:08.500 --> 14:11.083
and he ends up dead
a month later, June 19th.

14:11.166 --> 14:13.250
He was supposed
to testify the next day.

14:13.333 --> 14:15.917
And we really think this guy
got killed over politics?

14:16.000 --> 14:18.583
No, Joe McCarthy had
people crazed, Scotty.

14:18.667 --> 14:21.083
Communism had
overthrown China,
Korea.

14:21.166 --> 14:22.750
He had everyone
convinced we were
next.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.125
(John)
Now, here's something.

14:24.208 --> 14:25.417
Rosenbergs got the chair

14:25.500 --> 14:29.041
at sing sing in '53,
June 19th.

14:29.125 --> 14:30.917
Same day
as Garvey's murder.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.250
Explains the touch-up
on his car.

14:33.333 --> 14:35.000
- "You're Next."
- 'Yeah.'

14:35.083 --> 14:36.208
Much as I hate to say it

14:36.291 --> 14:38.959
it could explain
the soft investigation.

14:39.041 --> 14:40.792
What, you think
the cops tanked the case?

14:40.875 --> 14:42.959
No, people didn't want
commie killers in prison

14:43.041 --> 14:44.709
they wanted them in office.

14:44.792 --> 14:46.291
I'll put in
a call to the Bureau.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.500
They kept files on all of 'em.

14:50.041 --> 14:52.917
Been looking for a military
match on that blade.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.208
Got a hot bowl of nothing.

14:55.291 --> 14:56.709
We take another
crack at the wife.

14:56.792 --> 14:59.417
Secret's out,
maybe she'll talk.

15:04.959 --> 15:07.458
Hey, your sister
still in town?

15:07.542 --> 15:10.041
How'd you know
she was my
sister?

15:10.125 --> 15:11.834
I talked to her.

15:11.917 --> 15:13.625
Oh, I don't recommend
that too much.

15:19.000 --> 15:20.750
Looking for a Mrs. Lang?

15:23.583 --> 15:24.709
That's me.

15:24.792 --> 15:27.166
Lilly Rush, Homicide.

15:27.250 --> 15:28.792
We'd like to talk
to you about Elliot.

15:28.875 --> 15:32.250
I told the other ones,
I don't want to talk about
that.

15:32.333 --> 15:34.041
It's been 50 years.

15:34.125 --> 15:35.875
When do you think
might be good?

15:35.959 --> 15:37.834
Uh, we're going to the Rodin.

15:37.917 --> 15:40.458
The statues
ain't
going nowhere.

15:40.542 --> 15:42.083
Neither is Elliot.

15:42.166 --> 15:45.333
Your son Howard asked us
to look at the case.

15:45.417 --> 15:48.917
He was referred to us
after his suicide attempt.

15:52.875 --> 15:54.875
You didn't know?

15:57.083 --> 15:59.875
(Kay)
I tried to make Howie
forget about his father.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.458
I remarried.

16:01.542 --> 16:03.959
Thought we could
be a family again.

16:04.041 --> 16:05.291
He didn't forget.

16:05.375 --> 16:09.166
[sighs]
It was such a...painful
time.

16:09.250 --> 16:12.583
I never wanted Howard
to have to know.

16:12.667 --> 16:14.875
That his dad was a communist?

16:14.959 --> 16:16.625
Elliot wasn't a communist.

16:16.709 --> 16:18.083
Well, the feds came after him.

16:18.166 --> 16:19.875
Yes, because he went to some

16:19.959 --> 16:22.291
school integration meetings.

16:22.375 --> 16:23.417
That's it?

16:23.500 --> 16:27.083
That's all it took
in those days.

16:27.166 --> 16:30.000
Things took a steep
dive after that.

16:41.291 --> 16:43.667
Honey, you're early.

16:44.875 --> 16:46.250
Let me take that.

16:46.333 --> 16:49.250
I went overboard
and bought prime rib.

16:49.333 --> 16:50.709
Don't be sore.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.625
What is it?

17:00.083 --> 17:02.041
Jenkins suspended me.

17:02.125 --> 17:04.583
- Whatever for?
- He heard about the subpoena.

17:04.667 --> 17:08.125
- They can't do that to you.
- It's done.

17:08.208 --> 17:10.500
There's a stop
on my next paycheck.

17:13.375 --> 17:15.417
Our bills will go past due.

17:15.500 --> 17:16.750
I know.

17:18.500 --> 17:20.792
Well..

17:20.875 --> 17:22.166
It's ridiculous.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.500
It's all
a misunderstanding.

17:30.041 --> 17:32.375
What are you doing?

17:32.458 --> 17:34.917
We don't need prime rib.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.375
In fact, most of these
things, we can do without.

17:37.458 --> 17:39.083
He says it's just temporary.

17:40.333 --> 17:42.542
I'm sure it'll all be fine.

17:49.375 --> 17:51.500
It wasn't fine.

17:51.583 --> 17:53.583
I'll take it he
didn't get his job back.

17:53.667 --> 17:56.166
No, it was the
beginning of the
end.

17:56.250 --> 17:57.834
The neighbors
started to shun us.

17:57.917 --> 18:01.542
The...market
wouldn't sell to us.

18:01.625 --> 18:03.375
How'd Elliot handle it?

18:03.458 --> 18:05.709
He got quiet.

18:05.792 --> 18:07.875
Kept everything inside.

18:07.959 --> 18:09.583
Well, you must've
talked about it.

18:09.667 --> 18:10.917
Not really.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.792
The wall went up
between us, that was that.

18:15.166 --> 18:17.250
Anyone he might've opened up to?

18:18.458 --> 18:20.208
Our friend...Harland

18:20.291 --> 18:22.542
who brought him to that
meeting in the first place.

18:22.625 --> 18:25.583
- Harland?
- Sealey. Taught at Haverford.

18:36.875 --> 18:41.333
The irony was, I was
the dyed-in-the-wool communist.

18:41.417 --> 18:45.000
Elliot just thought
integration was an okay idea.

18:45.083 --> 18:46.458
So why'd they go after him?

18:46.542 --> 18:48.333
First rule of a witch hunt.

18:48.417 --> 18:51.208
"Don't limit yourself
to the witches."

18:51.291 --> 18:53.250
Or maybe they
wanted to roll him.

18:53.333 --> 18:56.000
Elliot's FBI file says they
were trying to get him to
spill

18:56.083 --> 18:57.542
who else was at those meetings.

18:57.625 --> 18:58.917
Why do you think
he lost his job?

18:59.000 --> 18:59.959
They were ruthless.

19:00.041 --> 19:01.375
(Lilly)
'But somebody kills him'

19:01.458 --> 19:03.291
the night before
he was supposed to testify.

19:03.375 --> 19:06.709
So whoever he was gonna
give up might've had motive.

19:06.792 --> 19:09.792
Ah, you don't have
to tell me about that. Ha ha.

19:09.875 --> 19:12.208
- Were you named?
- More than once.

19:12.291 --> 19:14.208
But not by Elliot.

19:14.291 --> 19:15.500
When they were done with me

19:15.583 --> 19:17.875
it was 12 years
before I could get

19:17.959 --> 19:19.834
another teaching job.

19:19.917 --> 19:22.750
- That's rough.
- Ah, I got off easy.

19:22.834 --> 19:26.250
The Rosenbergs,
they paid a real price.

19:26.333 --> 19:30.000
And Elliot, that same night.

19:30.083 --> 19:32.375
The third execution.

19:32.458 --> 19:34.875
So you think
they were related?

19:34.959 --> 19:36.917
We're talking fanatics.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.667
Any fanatics in particular
might've gone after Elliot?

19:40.750 --> 19:44.291
There was an incident
at a ball game.

19:44.375 --> 19:46.458
Polio took my chance for sport.

19:46.542 --> 19:48.667
But I've always loved to watch.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.959
Hey, pop. Mr. Sealey.

20:11.041 --> 20:12.542
How you feeling, Dean-o?

20:12.625 --> 20:14.709
Not so hot.

20:14.792 --> 20:16.375
(Dean)
'They're saying this
pitcher's throwing
fastballs'

20:16.458 --> 20:18.208
right out
of the majors.

20:18.291 --> 20:20.125
Boy can really
hum 'em in, huh?

20:20.208 --> 20:22.750
He's just about leading the
whole world in home runs, too.

20:22.834 --> 20:25.291
What do they say
about his uniform?

20:25.375 --> 20:26.792
Uniform?

20:26.875 --> 20:30.458
Figure he puts it
on one leg at a time?

20:31.875 --> 20:33.125
Yeah.

20:33.208 --> 20:34.625
(Dean)
Yeah, I'll bet he does.

20:34.709 --> 20:36.625
(Elliot)
'Maybe if you swing
a hair sooner'

20:36.709 --> 20:39.542
you might put
some wood on the ball.

20:39.625 --> 20:41.667
Hey, Garvey!

20:41.750 --> 20:43.375
You missed
the sign on the way in.

20:44.917 --> 20:47.041
(Wade)
'No parking
on the grass'

20:47.125 --> 20:48.959
no hooch on the field

20:49.041 --> 20:50.834
and no reds in the bleachers.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.291
That's bunk, Wade.

20:52.375 --> 20:54.834
Let me put it simple.

20:54.917 --> 20:57.750
We don't want your boy
on the field with ours.

20:57.834 --> 20:59.291
Come on, this is screwy.

20:59.375 --> 21:02.166
You're already
a disgrace to the country.

21:02.250 --> 21:04.500
Don't be one to your own kid.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.458
Go on, son. Go warm up.

21:09.542 --> 21:11.583
Your cruisin'
for a bruisin', pinko.

21:13.458 --> 21:15.500
Dad.

21:15.583 --> 21:18.709
- Come on, let's just go.
- No.

21:18.792 --> 21:19.834
We stay.

21:19.917 --> 21:21.583
You better look around.

21:21.667 --> 21:23.792
Not a soul here is
gonna stand behind you.

21:37.959 --> 21:39.625
(Harland)
He took Dean and left.

21:39.709 --> 21:41.500
I'd have done the same. Ha ha.

21:41.583 --> 21:42.542
Ribble meant it.

21:42.625 --> 21:45.333
He was an ignorant, violent man.

21:45.417 --> 21:46.917
(Scotty)
'But when Elliot was killed'

21:47.000 --> 21:49.375
you didn't report this
Ribble guy to the police?

21:50.500 --> 21:51.959
That would have been pointless.

21:53.125 --> 21:56.375
Wade Ribble was the police.

22:06.333 --> 22:08.458
Wade Ribble had
some IAB file.

22:08.542 --> 22:11.917
Excessive force, false
imprisonment, animal cruelty.

22:12.000 --> 22:13.500
Shot the neighbor's dog.

22:13.583 --> 22:14.709
Nice.

22:14.792 --> 22:15.959
But you better have evidence

22:16.041 --> 22:17.583
before you accuse
a cop of murder.

22:17.667 --> 22:19.750
You're the one who thought they
pulled up short on the case.

22:19.834 --> 22:22.667
That's a far cry from sweeping
a homicide under the rug.

22:22.750 --> 22:24.875
- Hey, boss.
- 'Morning.'

22:24.959 --> 22:26.583
What about the other angle?

22:26.667 --> 22:28.208
Uh, people at the meetings?

22:28.291 --> 22:29.959
Yeah, had a lot
to lose if Elliot

22:30.041 --> 22:31.542
named them when he testified.

22:31.625 --> 22:34.083
That makes the timing of
his death pretty conspicuous.

22:34.166 --> 22:35.208
- Huh.
- You get names?

22:35.291 --> 22:36.667
Well, Sealey gave us a few.

22:36.750 --> 22:39.208
- All of whom are dead.
- Ditto for Ribble.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.917
But there's a
restraining
order in the file

22:41.000 --> 22:42.792
from a lawyer
named Bloodworth.

22:42.875 --> 22:45.583
Telling Officer Ribble
to step off Elliot.

22:45.667 --> 22:47.375
Martin Bloodworth?

22:47.458 --> 22:50.083
- You know him?
- I knew him. He died last
year.

22:50.166 --> 22:51.834
If they were drawing up
papers, it was serious.

22:51.917 --> 22:54.041
It's not the kind of thing
his wife would forget.

22:56.750 --> 22:58.333
Wade Ribble was a menace.

22:58.417 --> 23:00.834
And we obviously couldn't
go to the police about him.

23:00.917 --> 23:02.750
So your lawyer filed
the restraining order.

23:02.834 --> 23:04.542
Yes, and looked
into his whereabouts

23:04.625 --> 23:06.291
the night Elliot died.

23:06.375 --> 23:07.792
What'd he find out?

23:07.875 --> 23:11.125
Ribble was in Harrisburg, at
the
state baseball championships.

23:12.166 --> 23:14.166
- So there's an alibi.
- Mm.

23:14.250 --> 23:18.375
Elliot said the only thing Wade
liked more than berating pinkos

23:18.458 --> 23:20.125
was berating umpires.

23:20.208 --> 23:23.083
[chuckles]
And do you know
what Elliot was planning

23:23.166 --> 23:25.083
on telling the committee?

23:25.166 --> 23:27.625
Well, I know what
they wanted him to do.

23:27.709 --> 23:30.083
They had a list. Ten names.

23:30.166 --> 23:31.417
All they wanted to hear was

23:31.500 --> 23:34.667
"Yes, these people
were at the meetings."

23:34.750 --> 23:36.250
But Elliot wouldn't do it?

23:37.834 --> 23:39.583
Said he didn't wanna ruin lives.

23:41.458 --> 23:43.875
But that ruined ours.

23:43.959 --> 23:46.834
Remember any names
from that list?

23:46.917 --> 23:49.041
Only one.

23:49.125 --> 23:50.875
A name I've tried to forget.

24:02.291 --> 24:03.750
Garveys.

24:03.834 --> 24:06.041
Yes.

24:06.125 --> 24:07.458
Oh, hello.

24:08.625 --> 24:11.792
Uh, I'll have
to phone you back.

24:13.917 --> 24:15.291
'Let me guess.'

24:15.375 --> 24:16.834
The woman with the accent.

24:19.875 --> 24:21.667
Barber shop closed today?

24:23.000 --> 24:25.875
take

24:25.959 --> 24:27.500
Not them, too.

24:32.792 --> 24:35.166
- Hey, mister, pick that up.
- What for? I don't need it.

24:35.250 --> 24:37.208
- What's that?
- I'm not going to Washington.

24:37.291 --> 24:38.208
Of course you are.

24:38.291 --> 24:40.417
I'm not an eagle scout anymore.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.625
- They just told me.
- They give a reason?

24:42.709 --> 24:44.917
Yeah. One guess.

24:48.583 --> 24:50.125
I'll be at Heather's.

24:53.667 --> 24:55.834
We're pariahs, Elliot.

24:55.917 --> 24:59.417
All you have to do is give
those names, and it will
stop.

24:59.500 --> 25:01.375
These feds with
their scare tactics

25:01.458 --> 25:03.667
going to the neighbors,
they're bullies.

25:03.750 --> 25:06.667
- I don't give in to
bullies.
- You can't beat them.

25:14.834 --> 25:16.041
It's because of her,
isn't it?

25:16.125 --> 25:17.583
(Elliot)
'What?'

25:17.667 --> 25:19.083
She's on the list.
You're protecting her.

25:19.166 --> 25:21.792
- Kay.
- Is she more important than
us?

25:21.875 --> 25:23.583
Of course not.

25:23.667 --> 25:25.041
Then name her.

25:31.041 --> 25:33.417
Her name was Reina Kraus.

25:33.500 --> 25:35.333
She was at
those meetings?

25:35.417 --> 25:37.750
And she was Elliot's mistress.

25:37.834 --> 25:39.208
You hear that from him?

25:39.291 --> 25:41.792
Pfft. I just knew.

25:41.875 --> 25:46.125
She was so beautiful,
exotic, worldly.

25:47.625 --> 25:50.291
How's a simple housewife
compete with that?

25:50.375 --> 25:51.667
Excuse me.

25:55.208 --> 25:57.417
Wasn't expecting you, Howard.

25:57.500 --> 26:00.583
Dean called. Said she was here.

26:05.709 --> 26:08.000
- Hi, mom.
- Hi.

26:09.875 --> 26:12.083
Your mom's been real helpful.

26:12.166 --> 26:14.125
They say you've
had some troubles.

26:14.208 --> 26:15.625
That surprise you?

26:15.709 --> 26:17.125
Howard, I'm sure your
mother did what she thought

26:17.208 --> 26:18.875
was best at the time.

26:18.959 --> 26:22.458
Telling us dad abandoned us?
Like some deadbeat?

26:22.542 --> 26:25.000
You're too young
to remember the shame.

26:25.083 --> 26:26.250
That's crap, ma.

26:26.333 --> 26:28.875
You're the one who dug
this up, Howie, not me.

26:28.959 --> 26:31.500
How else was I supposed to
find out what happened to dad?

26:31.583 --> 26:34.750
She was trying
to protect you, Howard.

26:39.583 --> 26:41.875
Well, she did a bang-up job.

26:47.166 --> 26:50.083
(Kay)
Let me see, Howie.

27:04.291 --> 27:06.834
(Reina)
Two...three..

27:06.917 --> 27:09.000
'...and exhale.'

27:12.166 --> 27:15.500
This last one is
Shavasana or corpse pose.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.792
You're the detective?

27:21.875 --> 27:23.709
Is there somewhere
we can talk?

27:28.792 --> 27:31.709
We got out of Prague in '44.

27:31.792 --> 27:34.917
My father wanted me to live in
a country without oppression.

27:36.458 --> 27:38.667
Little did he know.

27:38.750 --> 27:41.083
Ironic, I know.

27:42.458 --> 27:45.125
You spend a lot
of time with Elliot Garvey?

27:45.208 --> 27:47.125
As much as I could.

27:47.208 --> 27:48.500
How long was the affair?

27:49.500 --> 27:51.000
There was no affair.

27:51.083 --> 27:52.792
His wife says otherwise.

27:52.875 --> 27:54.125
No.

27:55.375 --> 27:57.917
We took walks..

27:58.000 --> 28:00.750
...we talked...that's all.

28:00.834 --> 28:04.417
The fact that you were on the
list, Reina, gives you motive.

28:04.500 --> 28:07.250
But I could never
have hurt Elliot.

28:07.333 --> 28:08.750
He meant too much.

28:11.917 --> 28:14.250
Some of us will be
downtown tonight..

28:14.333 --> 28:15.291
...for drinks.

28:15.375 --> 28:17.625
I don't know
if I can make it.

28:17.709 --> 28:18.583
Why not?

28:18.667 --> 28:21.583
It's complicated, with Kay.

28:21.667 --> 28:24.083
She wants me to cooperate.

28:24.166 --> 28:25.875
What do you want?

28:27.834 --> 28:30.417
I want to do right.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.000
So what is that?

28:32.083 --> 28:34.542
To me, it's saying no.

28:34.625 --> 28:37.291
No one knows what the future
is,
but I think the world

28:37.375 --> 28:39.875
will look back
at McCarthy as a disgrace.

28:39.959 --> 28:41.291
That's hard to believe.

28:41.375 --> 28:43.291
If you're asking
for permission to name me

28:43.375 --> 28:45.083
I can't give it to you.

28:51.709 --> 28:55.000
[sighs]
Kay, Kay thinks
this is about you.

28:55.083 --> 28:56.458
That there's
something between us.

29:00.250 --> 29:02.542
There is.

29:02.625 --> 29:04.417
I knew at the
meeting that night.

29:04.500 --> 29:07.542
What you said, so genuine.

29:07.625 --> 29:09.333
Reina.

29:09.417 --> 29:12.291
Tell me you don't
feel what I do.

29:14.834 --> 29:16.500
Say something.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.250
I believe in marriage.

29:25.625 --> 29:28.583
He was true to her.

29:28.667 --> 29:32.458
Which made me
love him even more.

29:32.542 --> 29:35.250
Do you know what he was going
to do, when he testified?

29:35.333 --> 29:37.166
I'd like to think
the right thing.

29:37.250 --> 29:39.250
For you or for his family?

29:39.333 --> 29:42.083
For him.

29:42.166 --> 29:44.667
Who were the other
names on the list?

30:04.834 --> 30:07.917
[chuckles]
Cute cats.

30:08.834 --> 30:09.792
Kind of tweaked, but..

30:09.875 --> 30:11.750
What are you doing here?

30:13.375 --> 30:15.041
I don't know where to go.

30:16.792 --> 30:19.542
[sighs]
Trains to New York
are still running.

30:19.625 --> 30:21.208
I told you, I can't go back.

30:21.291 --> 30:23.625
I told you, you can't stay.

30:29.583 --> 30:30.834
Lil.

30:32.542 --> 30:34.792
It was nine years ago.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.000
Can we get over this?

30:40.834 --> 30:42.250
I don't know, Chris.

30:42.333 --> 30:44.959
You have to forgive me sometime.

30:45.041 --> 30:46.333
Would you?

30:49.250 --> 30:50.500
No.

30:52.500 --> 30:53.792
Okay.

30:55.291 --> 30:56.500
Just so you know..

30:57.625 --> 30:59.834
...I like being back here.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.667
So I'll be around.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.959
It's a big city.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.917
Rush got the names
from that French lady.

31:15.000 --> 31:17.333
- She's Czech.
- Whatever. We got the list.

31:17.417 --> 31:19.333
But we don't need it.

31:19.417 --> 31:21.166
Mrs. Lang said
something about scouts.

31:21.250 --> 31:23.625
Got me thinking
about our broken blade.

31:23.709 --> 31:25.208
I ain't looking
at any more
logos.

31:25.291 --> 31:27.000
- This B here?
- 'Hmm.'

31:28.667 --> 31:29.709
"BSA."

31:29.792 --> 31:31.458
Boy Scouts of America.

31:31.542 --> 31:33.542
We're looking for
a boy scout gone bad?

31:33.625 --> 31:36.041
Oh, he was an
eagle scout, actually.

31:36.125 --> 31:38.875
Till he got his wings clipped.

31:44.542 --> 31:46.125
'53 was a tough year for you.

31:46.208 --> 31:49.250
Bounced off the baseball team,
cub scouts didn't want you.

31:49.333 --> 31:50.500
Eagle Scouts.

31:50.583 --> 31:53.291
(Scotty)
Right. That's like the
elite.

31:53.375 --> 31:55.959
The eagle scouts
become CEOs, Cabinet members.

31:56.041 --> 31:58.750
They ain't stuck calling
strikes in juco ball.

31:58.834 --> 32:00.250
(Nick)
'Quite a turn your life
took.'

32:00.333 --> 32:01.458
Those are the breaks.

32:01.542 --> 32:03.250
(Scotty)
'All 'cause of your dad.'

32:03.333 --> 32:05.834
Makes what you did
almost justifiable.

32:05.917 --> 32:08.083
- I didn't do nothin'!
- 'You followed him that
night.'

32:08.166 --> 32:09.417
You slashed his tires.

32:09.500 --> 32:11.083
(Scotty)
Made it so he had to walk home.

32:11.166 --> 32:12.250
You knew he'd
go through the park.

32:12.333 --> 32:13.792
- No.
- It was an ambush!

32:13.875 --> 32:14.834
You're wrong!

32:14.917 --> 32:15.834
Have they got a merit badge

32:15.917 --> 32:17.875
for premeditated murder, hmm?

32:30.792 --> 32:33.583
I didn't kill my dad.

32:33.667 --> 32:35.625
So explain that knife.

32:36.792 --> 32:38.792
I trashed the car..

32:38.875 --> 32:41.125
...but I was only
trying to scare him.

32:42.417 --> 32:43.542
Why?

32:43.625 --> 32:45.792
'Cause he was supposed
to testify the next day.

33:05.500 --> 33:07.083
Can't you people
leave me alone?

33:09.208 --> 33:11.208
Oh, my God!

33:11.291 --> 33:12.709
Dean?

33:12.792 --> 33:14.667
Dean, stop.

33:14.750 --> 33:16.166
Relax, it's okay, son.

33:16.250 --> 33:18.375
I don't really want you dead.

33:18.458 --> 33:20.333
- I know.
- 'I just..'

33:20.417 --> 33:23.083
I just...I wanted
you to be scared, and..

33:23.166 --> 33:26.959
- Son, it's okay.
- It's not okay!

33:27.041 --> 33:29.083
Just, just do what
they want, would you?

33:29.166 --> 33:31.542
Dean, they're asking me
to hurt people.

33:31.625 --> 33:33.583
Son, I swear, later on,
you'll understand.

33:33.667 --> 33:36.959
Later's gonna mean
nothing

33:37.041 --> 33:39.583
The girl I wanna
marry even deserted me.

33:39.667 --> 33:41.500
Heather? Dean, don't go.

33:41.583 --> 33:44.542
- Listen, I'm-I'm sorry--
- Don't be sorry!

33:45.625 --> 33:47.458
Fix it!

34:06.166 --> 34:07.583
It's my fault.

34:09.750 --> 34:13.250
He wouldn't have been in
that park if it wasn't for
me.

34:13.333 --> 34:16.792
Your dad's friend
Reina...you said she

34:16.875 --> 34:19.250
and Harland Sealey
were holding hands?

34:20.250 --> 34:21.709
Yeah.

34:21.792 --> 34:25.333
(John)
Sounds like Harland
and Reina were
close.

34:25.417 --> 34:28.208
Close enough he
should've mentioned her.

34:28.291 --> 34:29.959
He knew she was
at those meetings.

34:30.041 --> 34:32.083
So he's covering for her.

34:32.166 --> 34:33.417
But why?

34:35.208 --> 34:38.083
(Lilly)
You had the pick of
the crop, didn't you, Reina?

34:39.542 --> 34:42.166
With Elliot, Harland.

34:42.250 --> 34:43.166
What do you mean?

34:43.250 --> 34:45.333
But you also had a problem.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.125
If you were named,
you'd be deported.

34:47.208 --> 34:48.834
Yes.

34:48.917 --> 34:52.458
- Uh, forgot to mention that.
- How is that relevant?

34:52.542 --> 34:55.625
I'm guessing that's why
you loved Elliot so much.

34:55.709 --> 34:57.667
Why you couldn't
allow him to name you.

34:57.750 --> 34:59.500
You were looking out
for number one.

34:59.583 --> 35:03.166
I would have gone to Siberia
if Elliot asked me to.

35:03.250 --> 35:05.500
Yet you were cozying up
to Harland Sealey

35:05.583 --> 35:08.041
not a mile from where
Elliot was killed.

35:08.125 --> 35:10.417
If I was so scared
of being deported

35:10.500 --> 35:12.083
I would have married Harland.

35:12.166 --> 35:14.375
- Did he ask you?
- Yes.

35:16.083 --> 35:17.667
But he was a..

35:17.750 --> 35:19.709
...he was a man of words.

35:21.583 --> 35:23.208
I wanted the real thing.

35:24.625 --> 35:25.959
You wanted Elliot.

35:29.709 --> 35:31.583
Did Harland know that?

35:31.667 --> 35:33.250
It was obvious.

35:35.417 --> 35:36.792
And he knew Elliot
might give your name

35:36.875 --> 35:40.625
to the committee
sending you back to Prague.

35:52.542 --> 35:55.500
Uh, you gave us a lot,
Mr. Sealey.

35:55.583 --> 35:59.291
Names from the
meetings...a dirty cop.

35:59.375 --> 36:00.542
All of whom are dead.

36:00.625 --> 36:01.959
And innocent.

36:02.041 --> 36:03.875
But thanks, anyway.

36:03.959 --> 36:06.875
I'm sorry nothing panned out.

36:06.959 --> 36:09.667
Well, Reina Kraus
is still around..

36:09.750 --> 36:10.750
Mm.

36:10.834 --> 36:12.834
But you didn't mention her.

36:12.917 --> 36:15.667
Reina had nothing to
do with Elliot's death.

36:15.750 --> 36:18.166
(Lilly)
'Hmm, but she did.
She was the reason.'

36:18.250 --> 36:21.333
(Scotty)
'You wanted to marry her.'

36:21.417 --> 36:24.750
I plead guilty...to
being a young man in love.

36:26.667 --> 36:29.417
Must've hurt
knowing
she loved Elliot.

36:29.500 --> 36:30.959
What about Harland, here?

36:31.041 --> 36:33.792
She said he was
a man of words.

36:33.875 --> 36:35.667
All talk, no action.

36:35.750 --> 36:37.500
[chuckles]
That's tough luck.

36:37.583 --> 36:39.000
I didn't begrudge
Elliot anything.

36:39.083 --> 36:41.875
No? Even though he was
the one standing up to the
feds?

36:41.959 --> 36:43.667
- The hero?
- And the one getting the
girl?

36:43.750 --> 36:46.834
The girl Elliot might give up
to the committee the next day.

36:46.917 --> 36:49.959
Elliot hadn't decided
on anything that night.

36:53.208 --> 36:55.000
Oh, how do you know?

36:55.083 --> 36:57.917
I mean, either you're
some kinda psychic..

36:58.000 --> 36:59.834
Or you were with him that night.

37:05.458 --> 37:07.500
They're not gonna put me away.

37:09.041 --> 37:11.458
I only have a few years left.

37:11.542 --> 37:15.500
Then you can decide right now
how you're gonna live 'em.

37:18.709 --> 37:22.375
It wasn't just Elliot
that died that day.

37:22.458 --> 37:24.458
A whole family died, too.

37:24.542 --> 37:27.709
(Lilly)
'You want to be
a man of action?'

37:27.792 --> 37:29.792
This is your last chance.

37:34.375 --> 37:36.250
(man on TV)
'Both refuse to admit
any wrongdoing'

37:36.333 --> 37:39.125
'and proclaim their innocence
right up until the end.'

37:39.208 --> 37:40.750
'And that's the news
from Sing Sing.'

37:40.834 --> 37:42.458
'Officially, then,
and at long last'

37:42.542 --> 37:46.000
'Atom spies Julius and
Ethel Rosenberg are dead.'

37:57.583 --> 37:59.792
It's so terrible.

38:02.875 --> 38:06.458
It's...too bad that Elliot
didn't make it tonight.

38:06.542 --> 38:08.959
He has a lot on his mind.

38:09.041 --> 38:10.667
Naturally.

38:10.750 --> 38:13.917
I'm going home, Harland.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.083
Goodnight.

38:17.166 --> 38:18.458
Goodnight.

38:31.959 --> 38:33.166
There you are.

38:34.959 --> 38:35.917
We missed you.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.375
Evening, Harland.

38:38.458 --> 38:41.250
That's some nasty
business here, huh?

38:41.333 --> 38:43.750
May have to
arrange for a tow.

38:44.792 --> 38:46.291
(Harland)
'Come on'.

38:46.375 --> 38:48.125
I'll walk you home.

38:48.208 --> 38:49.667
In case they come back.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.291
[sighs]
They're not coming back.

38:53.375 --> 38:55.083
Hey, can't be too careful.

39:03.792 --> 39:06.125
Big day tomorrow.

39:06.208 --> 39:07.458
Yeah.

39:11.166 --> 39:13.500
If I were a gambling man,
I wouldn't dare sit down

39:13.583 --> 39:16.000
at the table with you tonight.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.291
I have a lot to think over.

39:20.041 --> 39:22.166
There's not a soul
out here with us.

39:22.250 --> 39:24.417
We could talk it through.

39:24.500 --> 39:26.375
I'm all talked out, Harland.

39:26.458 --> 39:27.750
Might help.

39:27.834 --> 39:29.458
Even a good man
sometimes folds.

39:29.542 --> 39:30.792
Listen, Harland,
you don't have to worry.

39:30.875 --> 39:32.417
You're not on the list.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.542
Then what's
to think over?

39:36.709 --> 39:39.542
Reina is on the list.

39:39.625 --> 39:40.750
Yeah.

39:40.834 --> 39:42.709
'What about her?'

39:42.792 --> 39:44.750
Will you name her?

39:44.834 --> 39:46.291
Kay wants me to.

39:46.375 --> 39:47.667
And?

39:47.750 --> 39:49.709
Oh, but my-my
conscience says not to.

39:49.792 --> 39:50.917
So?

39:51.000 --> 39:55.291
So I...I don't know
what I'll do.

39:55.375 --> 39:57.500
- What are you doing?
- You can't give her up.

39:57.583 --> 39:59.083
- Get ahold of yourself.
<i>can't!</i>

39:59.166 --> 40:01.083
I never said I would!

40:02.250 --> 40:04.000
I can't take that chance.

43:06.583 --> 43:07.792
