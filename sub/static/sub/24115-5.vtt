WEBVTT

00:01.040 --> 00:03.794
This initiative is about
targeting Black Zero.

00:03.960 --> 00:06.077
Nobody fires unless

00:06.240 --> 00:08.071
I give the order.

00:08.240 --> 00:09.754
Let him go.

00:09.920 --> 00:11.680
What happened here?

00:11.720 --> 00:13.359
Kol-Da, you are under arrest.

00:13.600 --> 00:15.239
Lyta, thank you.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.039
I need someone
to take responsibility

00:17.240 --> 00:18.760
for the Rankless
initiative's failures.

00:18.920 --> 00:20.434
Commander Zod,
it's by Rao's word

00:20.600 --> 00:22.557
that you are hereby
charged with treason.

00:22.720 --> 00:23.776
What's gonna happen to her?

00:23.800 --> 00:26.474
She'll be executed just like
your grandfather was.

00:26.640 --> 00:28.074
Why do you want
to save Lyta-Zod?

00:28.240 --> 00:30.391
Because I love her.
Will you help her?

00:30.560 --> 00:31.391
She's innocent.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.472
The moment Lyta dies,
so does our chance

00:33.640 --> 00:34.994
<i>to overthrow
the Voice of Rao.</i>

00:35.160 --> 00:36.480
I have come
to make you an offer

00:36.680 --> 00:38.194
that could
save Lyta's life.

00:38.360 --> 00:39.635
For the cost of what?

00:39.800 --> 00:41.917
Pledge your support
for my father.

00:42.080 --> 00:43.400
Thanks for always
having my back.

00:43.600 --> 00:44.600
It's more than loyalty.

00:44.720 --> 00:45.870
<i>Val, I'm headed your way.</i>

00:46.320 --> 00:47.320
Do you read?

00:48.440 --> 00:50.397
<i>Tell me what you know
about Brainiac.</i>

00:50.840 --> 00:53.833
<i>Together we can protect
the future of Krypton.</i>

01:00.360 --> 01:02.158
<i>Seg-El is somewhere
in the complex.</i>

01:02.320 --> 01:03.117
Find him.

01:03.280 --> 01:06.512
You're my daughter,
and Zods are not traitors.

01:06.680 --> 01:08.672
I think you're here
protecting Seg.

01:08.880 --> 01:11.520
If you want to help me,
then for once in your life

01:11.680 --> 01:14.832
- trust me.
- Trust runs both ways, Lyta.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.995
<i>What makes a Zod?</i>

01:22.880 --> 01:23.950
<i>Is it blood?</i>

01:29.160 --> 01:30.160
<i>Jayna.</i>

01:33.000 --> 01:34.036
<i>Vidar.</i>

01:37.560 --> 01:40.439
<i>You were born
into a great House.</i>

01:42.680 --> 01:44.239
<i>A House of Warriors.</i>

01:46.760 --> 01:50.959
<i>Warriors whose
courage, honor...</i>

01:52.560 --> 01:55.519
<i>...And loyalty to the State
are without equal.</i>

01:56.960 --> 01:58.394
<i>And without question.</i>

02:13.840 --> 02:16.400
You hold back because
she is your sister.

02:17.960 --> 02:20.600
Your unwillingness
to land the blow ensures

02:20.760 --> 02:23.355
that she will remain
vulnerable to such an attack

02:23.520 --> 02:25.079
from a future opponent,

02:25.240 --> 02:27.835
one not blinded
by sentiment as you are.

02:28.600 --> 02:30.080
Is that honorable?

02:40.040 --> 02:43.795
<i>To earn the name Zod, you
must place honor above all.</i>

02:44.600 --> 02:46.000
<i>Above love.</i>

02:47.640 --> 02:48.915
<i>Above life.</i>

02:52.320 --> 02:54.880
<i>Even above family.</i>

03:26.360 --> 03:27.953
There.
Blood.

03:30.720 --> 03:32.154
He won't last long out here.

03:32.920 --> 03:34.832
Especially with
the ice storm coming.

03:35.360 --> 03:37.556
We better find him
before it hits.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.793
Okay.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.320
Okay.

04:29.560 --> 04:30.835
Okay, okay, okay.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.040
Ah, come on, come on.

04:37.040 --> 04:38.110
Hello.

04:38.280 --> 04:40.033
Hello, ca...

04:40.560 --> 04:41.560
Can any...

04:44.120 --> 04:45.156
Shit.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.000
Ah.

05:44.800 --> 05:45.870
Help me.

05:46.520 --> 05:48.955
Please.
They'll be back soon.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.832
I know a way to safety.
Huh?

05:56.040 --> 05:57.156
Far from these people.

06:22.400 --> 06:23.516
Deactivate the barrier.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.034
- Dev.
- You're a Zod.

06:25.520 --> 06:27.796
Wouldn't run
even if I begged you.

06:29.080 --> 06:30.799
Do it and go.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.269
I'll be responsible.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.550
I should've come sooner.

06:45.720 --> 06:47.518
You shouldn't
have come at all.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.400
You really expect me
to believe that all this time

06:50.560 --> 06:52.119
you've been
a Black Zero operative?

06:52.280 --> 06:54.237
Clearly some do.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.196
I was thinking about
the first night we met.

07:01.760 --> 07:04.673
The Nova Cycle
First Night Dinner.

07:05.360 --> 07:06.999
Was that really 18 cycles ago?

07:07.160 --> 07:11.359
I couldn't believe my family
got seated with House Zod.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.320
When I saw the Fire of Rao,

07:14.480 --> 07:17.279
I knew I'd never see
anything as beautiful.

07:20.160 --> 07:21.992
And then I saw you.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.429
I paid that Rankless

07:29.600 --> 07:31.637
to spread spark snow
in the Fire.

07:31.840 --> 07:34.480
Only you would try
to improve the Ceremonial Fire.

07:34.680 --> 07:35.909
I had no idea it would...

07:36.080 --> 07:37.594
Set fire
to the Surrus blossoms.

07:39.600 --> 07:42.195
I didn't ask you
to take the blame for me.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.520
You didn't have to.

07:47.440 --> 07:49.557
I was already in love with you.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.511
Look, I know you don't
feel the same way

07:57.680 --> 07:59.433
I feel about you, but...

08:09.880 --> 08:11.394
I do love you.

08:24.760 --> 08:27.016
He's nowhere to be found and
he's not picking up his comm.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.952
I'm telling you, something
is seriously wrong.

08:29.320 --> 08:31.357
Yes, Lyta has been
scheduled for execution.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.511
It does not get
more wrong for Seg.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.039
He will show up eventually.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.015
Great, so until then I'm just
supposed to sit around

08:37.039 --> 08:38.155
with my thumb up my ass?

08:39.440 --> 08:41.120
Yeah, if... if you think
that's gonna help.

08:41.200 --> 08:42.200
Be my guest.

08:42.320 --> 08:44.320
It'll probably be a lot
more help than you've been.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.156
Why would you put
your thumb...

08:48.320 --> 08:49.320
Uh.

08:53.320 --> 08:55.516
You know yet,
we getting close?

08:55.720 --> 08:56.720
How much further?

08:58.960 --> 09:00.155
Hey, come on, stay with me.

09:01.000 --> 09:02.880
I need you to tell me
how to get us out of here.

09:03.720 --> 09:05.712
Straight, we go straight.

09:05.880 --> 09:06.880
Straight?

09:07.000 --> 09:08.320
You said that
three straights ago.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.200
How can you even tell?
It looks all the same.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.176
Co... come on, come on.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.200
You gotta stay with me.

09:13.440 --> 09:14.669
Come on, keep talking.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.240
What's your name?
Tell me your name.

09:16.800 --> 09:19.360
- What's your name?
- Raika.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.475
- I am Raika.
- Raika.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.071
Great.
I'm Seg.

09:25.280 --> 09:26.509
Those people back there,

09:28.280 --> 09:29.634
what do they want from you?

09:29.800 --> 09:31.234
Why were they torturing you?

09:32.520 --> 09:34.398
I could not let them find it.

09:34.560 --> 09:35.560
Find what?

09:37.040 --> 09:38.713
That which we protect.

09:38.880 --> 09:40.473
Protect?
What do you mean "protect"?

09:40.680 --> 09:41.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.114
Come on, we gotta keep moving.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.040
Whoa, hey, friends, friends,
friend of Raika's.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.793
She's hurt.
I tried to help her.

10:21.840 --> 10:22.910
<i>Ha neh fra bor.</i>

10:23.680 --> 10:25.399
<i>Jayta fesu henni Raika.</i>

10:25.600 --> 10:27.193
<i>Yek un gas ka-ta meh hann.</i>

10:28.240 --> 10:30.596
Yeah, well, that...
looks bad.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.991
Um, that probably doesn't help,

10:33.160 --> 10:35.755
but I used those to pry open
Raika's shackles

10:36.280 --> 10:37.634
when I rescued her.

10:37.800 --> 10:38.800
Heroically.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.600
El?

10:47.600 --> 10:50.035
Yeah, El.

10:50.520 --> 10:52.159
Seg-El.
Yeah.

10:52.800 --> 10:53.800
Very good.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.270
Oh, shit.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.753
<i>Do you have any idea
what you've done?</i>

11:07.360 --> 11:09.158
I'm trying
to salvage this mess.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.039
By going behind my back?

11:11.200 --> 11:13.396
To the Primus of the Sagitari?

11:13.560 --> 11:16.758
What makes you think Jayna
is ready to join us

11:16.920 --> 11:19.515
and go against everything
House Zod stands for?

11:19.680 --> 11:21.876
The fact that most parents
love their children.

11:24.880 --> 11:27.793
And if she does love
her daughter that much,

11:28.200 --> 11:30.240
what's to stop her going
to the Voice of Rao himself

11:30.400 --> 11:32.073
and bargaining
for a better deal?

11:32.240 --> 11:33.913
You have risked everything,
Nyssa.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.072
We need the Sagitari.

11:36.240 --> 11:37.640
She's a Zod.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.593
If we don't stop
Lyta's execution,

11:39.800 --> 11:41.359
we lose Jayna.

11:41.520 --> 11:43.796
And then we lose the chance
to make a better Kandor.

11:43.960 --> 11:45.235
A better Kandor?

11:47.400 --> 11:50.598
There's something else
clouding your judgment.

11:52.240 --> 11:53.720
Or someone else.

11:57.480 --> 11:59.836
Seg, perhaps?

12:01.560 --> 12:05.031
I did what I did so we
can prevail against a tyrant.

12:05.240 --> 12:08.119
A tyrant with power
and a temper.

12:08.440 --> 12:10.079
If Jayna agrees,

12:10.240 --> 12:12.630
and joins us to spare her
beloved daughter,

12:12.800 --> 12:14.439
how do I explain to the Voice

12:14.600 --> 12:16.796
that he won't get
the blood he's asked for?

12:17.000 --> 12:18.070
And if she refuses,

12:18.240 --> 12:19.480
and tells the Voice
of our plans

12:19.560 --> 12:21.358
before we can put them
in motion,

12:21.640 --> 12:23.552
then the blood he asks for

12:24.040 --> 12:25.394
will be ours.

13:07.720 --> 13:09.074
How do you all
survive down here?

13:23.120 --> 13:24.120
Cythonna.

13:25.520 --> 13:27.034
With her love and blessing,

13:27.240 --> 13:28.959
all things are possible.

13:29.320 --> 13:32.711
Cythonna?
The Ice Goddess?

13:32.880 --> 13:35.873
The true Mother of Krypton.

13:39.400 --> 13:41.232
You're Cythonnites?

13:43.400 --> 13:45.198
This is a sacred place.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.712
You do not belong here.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.312
Why have you come, El?

13:51.480 --> 13:53.676
Raika brought me here
after I rescued her

13:53.840 --> 13:54.910
from some
very bad people.

13:55.080 --> 13:56.400
Your people.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.800
If they were my people, would
they have done this to me?

14:01.680 --> 14:02.680
But hey,

14:03.360 --> 14:05.416
you don't want me here, I don't
particularly want to be here,

14:05.440 --> 14:06.736
so point me
in the direction of Kandor

14:06.760 --> 14:08.752
and I'll gladly
be on my way.

14:11.520 --> 14:14.194
You have shown one
of our own a kindness.

14:14.960 --> 14:17.475
Allow us to return it
by healing your wounds.

15:08.120 --> 15:10.919
I testified exactly
as you told me to.

15:11.480 --> 15:13.119
Why am I still here?

15:13.280 --> 15:14.680
Procedural delay.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.351
Nothing more.

15:16.560 --> 15:18.358
Stymied by bureaucracy?

15:19.680 --> 15:21.319
Most powerful man in Kandor.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.035
Second most.

15:25.080 --> 15:26.719
You will be out soon.

15:29.160 --> 15:32.278
And we will be
sipping drinks by nightfall.

15:34.400 --> 15:35.675
Good.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.639
<i>Every moment
of your life is a test.</i>

16:33.840 --> 16:36.116
<i>One that reveals who you are.</i>

16:36.280 --> 16:39.273
<i>And if you truly are worthy
of the name Zod.</i>

16:41.240 --> 16:44.074
Today is your trial by ice.

16:44.720 --> 16:47.952
You will make your way
to the Jewel Mountains.

16:48.360 --> 16:50.033
You will follow in the
footsteps of those

16:50.200 --> 16:51.793
who have
come before you.

16:51.960 --> 16:54.429
Or you will die trying.

17:09.560 --> 17:12.439
<i>At the southern base
is the Sword of Jo-Mon,</i>

17:13.040 --> 17:16.192
<i>the fiercest of all
Kryptonian warriors.</i>

17:22.960 --> 17:27.796
<i>There you will find the oxygen
that will ease your return.</i>

17:32.840 --> 17:34.638
There's only one respirator.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.714
We made it all
this way without one.

17:37.880 --> 17:40.190
- And we almost died.
- But we didn't.

17:41.120 --> 17:42.315
We can do this.

17:43.640 --> 17:44.756
We're too far out.

17:44.920 --> 17:46.434
We share the respirator.

17:46.600 --> 17:47.954
We each use half.

17:48.120 --> 17:49.296
It took all we had
to get here.

17:49.320 --> 17:50.913
- We have to try.
- No!

17:51.600 --> 17:53.273
Don't you see?
This is the test.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.834
We're wasting
breath arguing.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.320
We can both do this.

18:04.400 --> 18:05.550
I'm sorry.

18:05.960 --> 18:07.360
Vidar, don't.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.756
Better than letting you
freeze out here.

18:09.960 --> 18:10.960
I'll make it quick.

18:20.880 --> 18:21.950
Don't.

18:22.640 --> 18:23.994
Don't leave me here.

18:26.320 --> 18:27.515
Jayna!

18:32.440 --> 18:33.590
Jayna!

18:38.000 --> 18:39.000
Jayna!

18:40.400 --> 18:41.993
You have to make a decision.

18:51.720 --> 18:54.519
You're sacrificing your
daughter for honor?

18:54.680 --> 18:57.195
You dare speak
to me of honor?

18:59.520 --> 19:01.318
Tell me, Primus.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.515
What makes you any different
from those who blindly follow

19:04.680 --> 19:05.750
the Voice of Rao?

19:07.520 --> 19:10.797
You'll say anything
to achieve your desires.

19:11.320 --> 19:13.039
That's your code.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.311
Duty is action.

19:17.600 --> 19:19.910
Duty is thought.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.470
What about
your duty to Lyta?

19:22.680 --> 19:25.320
One word from you
and she is saved.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.560
Her rank, her honor restored.

19:29.280 --> 19:32.239
You serve an oppressive ruler
without question.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.231
Why not serve my father

19:35.440 --> 19:36.715
who wants to truly lead?

19:36.880 --> 19:39.111
You aspire to lead,

19:39.680 --> 19:43.594
yet know nothing
about being a leader.

19:48.080 --> 19:50.117
Is that a yes or a no?

20:01.200 --> 20:02.456
That actually
feels a lot better.

20:02.480 --> 20:03.596
What is this stuff?

20:09.600 --> 20:12.035
Okay, well, not bad for
something that clearly came out

20:12.200 --> 20:13.350
of some creature's ass.

20:15.600 --> 20:16.600
Thank you.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.320
I'm glad you pulled through.

20:20.480 --> 20:24.315
Yes,
thanks to you.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.510
What are they saying?

20:35.920 --> 20:37.479
I know it's about me.

20:40.960 --> 20:42.235
Come on, Raika.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.710
Talk to me.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.720
They're trying to figure out
what to do with you.

20:50.720 --> 20:51.756
What's to figure out?

20:51.920 --> 20:53.280
Unless they have
no intention of...

20:54.520 --> 20:56.193
letting me leave.

20:57.200 --> 20:58.714
I'm sorry.

20:58.880 --> 21:00.080
If I had known you were an El,

21:00.200 --> 21:02.078
I would never have
brought you to this place.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.478
Well, that seems
a little judgy.

21:04.640 --> 21:06.696
You barely know me, except
for the fact that I saved you.

21:06.720 --> 21:08.040
Do you remember that?

21:08.240 --> 21:09.720
You are an El.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.315
You have the power
to destroy everything.

21:13.600 --> 21:14.600
What do you mean?

21:16.520 --> 21:17.351
I've said too much.

21:17.520 --> 21:19.671
Too much?
You haven't told me shit.

21:20.160 --> 21:21.960
Why would you think
that I could ever do that?

21:22.400 --> 21:24.392
Because the House of El
has done it before.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.399
I can't say any more
about this.

21:31.640 --> 21:33.279
What exactly
did my family do?

21:34.240 --> 21:35.240
I'm sorry,

21:35.840 --> 21:38.309
but all I can say is our duty
to protect this place

21:38.520 --> 21:40.113
from your family
has been passed

21:40.280 --> 21:41.680
from generation
to generation.

21:41.840 --> 21:44.912
Well, all I can say is that
my family means you no harm.

21:45.080 --> 21:45.831
And I'm leaving.

21:46.000 --> 21:47.992
They will never let you
out of here alive.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.040
Then help me.

21:51.600 --> 21:52.750
Help me, like I helped you.

21:52.920 --> 21:53.920
No.

21:54.760 --> 21:56.513
You will tell others
about this place.

21:58.600 --> 22:00.034
You're worried about others?

22:00.800 --> 22:02.120
Do you know what happens

22:02.720 --> 22:04.120
when I don't go home?

22:05.640 --> 22:07.552
Others come looking for me.

22:08.720 --> 22:09.720
Els.

22:09.880 --> 22:11.917
That's right, yeah.

22:12.120 --> 22:15.955
All my brothers, and all
my cousins, and all my uncles.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.760
Pretty soon this place is
gonna be crawling with Els.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.435
And think about
the destruction they could do.

22:22.720 --> 22:24.951
But you can make sure
that none of that happens.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.240
All I need

22:27.720 --> 22:30.189
is a respirator
and a way out of here.

22:44.040 --> 22:45.554
I should've asked

22:46.120 --> 22:48.715
for more than just
a respirator.

22:51.320 --> 22:54.711
<i>Warning.
Oxygen level near depletion.</i>

22:55.440 --> 22:59.275
<i>Warning. Replenish oxygen
supply immediately.</i>

23:06.720 --> 23:08.677
<i>Warning...</i>

24:06.360 --> 24:08.556
It's not too late
to stop this.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.797
<i>Jayna!</i>

24:26.720 --> 24:28.791
Vidar, he's still out there...

24:28.960 --> 24:30.519
Do not think of your brother.

24:30.680 --> 24:32.433
He no longer
has a place among us.

24:39.560 --> 24:41.870
My mother gave this to me.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.072
As her father gave it to her.

24:45.120 --> 24:48.397
As you know, it has
never been apart from me.

24:49.080 --> 24:51.037
It is indestructible.

24:51.680 --> 24:53.876
As is your spirit, Jayna.

24:54.880 --> 24:56.519
I saw that from the start.

24:57.960 --> 24:59.679
Your purpose is fulfilled.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.399
And your destiny clear.

25:01.920 --> 25:04.754
You take your place
in the House of Zod,

25:04.920 --> 25:06.832
protector of Krypton.

25:07.000 --> 25:08.354
With you serving it,

25:08.520 --> 25:12.833
our people's future is
as bright as Rao's light.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.956
You are a Zod.

25:33.120 --> 25:36.272
As such, you kneel to no one.

26:34.800 --> 26:36.314
Stop.

26:38.400 --> 26:39.675
Lyta-Zod,

26:41.480 --> 26:43.119
the witness against you
has recanted.

26:46.920 --> 26:50.596
All testimony is
hereby rescinded.

26:51.400 --> 26:54.950
And all charges of treason
are dropped.

26:55.120 --> 26:58.318
You are to be reinstated
immediately to full rank.

27:05.680 --> 27:07.194
The Council...

27:08.920 --> 27:10.195
apologizes.

27:54.880 --> 27:55.880
Mother, I...

27:56.560 --> 27:58.472
I don't understand this.
I...

27:59.000 --> 28:00.434
I don't know how this happened.

28:03.360 --> 28:06.432
I guess I have Nyssa-Vex
to thank.

28:06.920 --> 28:08.560
She'll be expecting
something in return...

28:08.720 --> 28:10.279
You owe her nothing.

28:10.440 --> 28:12.238
Do you understand?

28:12.400 --> 28:13.629
Nothing.

28:15.200 --> 28:16.350
It was you.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.599
You saved me.

28:26.040 --> 28:27.952
I thought I was going to die.

28:31.880 --> 28:33.439
I just... I can't believe it,
how?

28:33.600 --> 28:34.670
What did you do?

28:38.240 --> 28:42.314
I know you've truly never
understood this, Lyta.

28:42.640 --> 28:44.950
But you've always been
my greatest love.

28:47.280 --> 28:49.670
And now my greatest shame.

28:50.360 --> 28:51.635
Mother?

28:53.440 --> 28:54.440
Mother.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.400
Why am I still here?

29:03.040 --> 29:04.838
I demand to see
the Chief Magistrate.

29:07.520 --> 29:08.840
What is going on?

29:09.000 --> 29:10.354
Where's Daron-Vex?

29:37.600 --> 29:39.432
End program.

30:04.560 --> 30:06.836
I want a full investigation.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.154
I will find out

30:10.640 --> 30:12.996
how a prisoner of the Sagitari
was able to get a weapon

30:13.200 --> 30:14.429
into her cell.

30:18.520 --> 30:19.715
Go!

30:25.840 --> 30:28.150
I must say,
you nearly had me fooled.

30:30.480 --> 30:32.995
Well, let's hope the Voice
of Rao will be as well.

30:33.840 --> 30:36.275
No, I meant
your feelings for Kol-Da.

30:36.840 --> 30:39.150
You did care for her.

30:42.640 --> 30:44.359
Yes, I did.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.075
Very much.

30:50.400 --> 30:52.312
She was a fierce warrior.

30:55.080 --> 30:57.197
And loyal to our cause.

30:58.280 --> 30:59.839
And yet...

31:02.040 --> 31:03.520
And yet,

31:04.680 --> 31:06.717
you left me with little choice.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.873
A sacrifice...
had to be made.

31:26.880 --> 31:29.634
<i>Warning.
Oxygen level near depletion.</i>

31:29.800 --> 31:31.951
Yeah.
Painfully aware of that.

31:33.640 --> 31:35.757
<i>Please replenish
oxygen supply.</i>

31:36.400 --> 31:37.400
Can't do that.

31:37.880 --> 31:40.270
<i>Warning.
Oxygen level critical.</i>

31:40.520 --> 31:43.718
- I heard you!
<i>- Warning. Oxygen now depleted.</i>

31:43.920 --> 31:44.920
Fine.

31:45.960 --> 31:47.280
Maybe you'll shut up.

32:07.640 --> 32:10.109
<i>Warning. Oxygen now depleted.</i>

32:10.280 --> 32:11.873
That's enough out of you.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.280
Okay.

32:34.920 --> 32:35.990
Okay.

32:36.960 --> 32:39.395
Come on.
Come on, baby.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Come on now.

32:42.960 --> 32:44.838
Yes!
Yes.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.560
Adam! Adam, come in.

32:49.080 --> 32:50.878
Shit.
No, come on.

32:51.040 --> 32:52.394
This has to work.

32:52.560 --> 32:55.120
Adam, it's Seg.
Do you hear me?

32:57.720 --> 33:00.474
He's about yea high,
dreamy eyes, legs for days.

33:00.640 --> 33:01.960
<i>Adam, Adam, do you read?
It's Seg.</i>

33:02.040 --> 33:03.156
Uh, Seg, Seg, yeah.

33:03.320 --> 33:05.200
<i>- Adam, can you hear me?</i>
- Yeah, Seg, I got you.

33:06.160 --> 33:08.834
Adam, there's...ference...

33:09.560 --> 33:10.630
I can hear you.

33:10.840 --> 33:11.840
Uh...

33:12.640 --> 33:13.915
Can you hear me now?

33:14.400 --> 33:16.995
<i>Seg, can you hear me now?</i>

33:18.280 --> 33:21.159
Adam, listen.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.153
I don't know how much time
I have.

33:25.000 --> 33:26.673
<i>I'm in the Outlands,
and I'm stuck.</i>

33:26.840 --> 33:28.991
<i>I need help.</i>

33:29.160 --> 33:30.640
<i>But if things go badly,</i>

33:31.640 --> 33:33.518
<i>there's something I need you
to do for me.</i>

33:41.280 --> 33:42.634
I got your message.

33:49.440 --> 33:50.590
How is it
I'm standing here?

33:50.760 --> 33:52.194
Rao works in mysterious ways.

33:52.360 --> 33:53.794
Clearly, so do you.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.391
What is going on between
you and my mother

33:57.560 --> 33:58.560
and where is Seg?

33:58.720 --> 34:00.473
- Nobody's seen him.
- Commander Zod.

34:02.040 --> 34:05.397
Commander, this man claims
to have information for you.

34:05.840 --> 34:07.035
What do I do with him?

34:07.440 --> 34:09.431
I'll deal with him.
Dismissed.

34:12.639 --> 34:13.835
You remember me?

34:15.199 --> 34:16.679
Seg's friend.

34:18.840 --> 34:20.320
The alien.

34:20.480 --> 34:22.870
- What is it?
- I've got a message from him.

34:35.520 --> 34:38.592
<i>Lyta, if you're hearing this,</i>

34:39.080 --> 34:40.480
<i>you know what happened.</i>

34:41.719 --> 34:42.995
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

34:46.920 --> 34:48.797
<i>I wish I knew you were okay.</i>

34:48.960 --> 34:50.792
<i>You've always been
the strongest,</i>

34:50.960 --> 34:52.792
<i>bravest person I know.</i>

34:53.800 --> 34:56.998
<i>Ugh, it's cold as shit out here.</i>

34:57.280 --> 34:58.760
<i>I bet you'd survive it,
though.</i>

35:00.440 --> 35:01.954
<i>You will survive.</i>

35:02.640 --> 35:03.915
<i>I know you.</i>

35:07.920 --> 35:09.752
<i>Do you remember
our first kiss?</i>

35:10.760 --> 35:13.434
<i>I'd give anything to kiss you
one more time.</i>

35:15.800 --> 35:20.397
<i>You are everything good</i>

35:20.920 --> 35:22.240
<i>in me.</i>

35:27.080 --> 35:28.150
<i>And...</i>

35:29.560 --> 35:30.960
<i>I love you.</i>

35:31.840 --> 35:32.840
<i>I...</i>

35:40.560 --> 35:41.560
Follow me.

35:45.200 --> 35:45.838
There's still a chance.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.200
That's why
I'm coming with you.

35:47.320 --> 35:48.834
I've got a general area
where he's at.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.936
I hope you got some tech
that can narrow that down

35:50.960 --> 35:52.360
a little bit.
Whoa.

35:52.520 --> 35:55.035
Lieutenant Tai,
you're with me.

35:55.200 --> 35:57.078
S&R Ops.
Outlands.

35:57.240 --> 36:00.074
Suit up.
I'll brief you on the way.

36:04.120 --> 36:04.792
Put that on.

36:04.960 --> 36:07.395
Lyta, if you need another
man, I'll get suited up.

36:07.600 --> 36:09.592
No, it's...
classified.

36:10.280 --> 36:12.670
I'll talk to you soon, okay?

36:14.640 --> 36:15.710
Let's move.

36:16.960 --> 36:17.960
Rough.

36:24.920 --> 36:27.389
Seg-El was captured
by a faction of Black Zero.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.677
He escaped.
He's in the Outlands.

36:29.840 --> 36:31.520
There's a Level 6 ice storm
in that sector.

36:31.560 --> 36:33.119
No way he survives that.

36:33.280 --> 36:35.016
Hate to be the one
to break bad news to Nyssa-Vex.

36:35.040 --> 36:37.236
Secure that shit, Lieutenant.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.432
We bring him back alive.

36:39.600 --> 36:41.592
- Clear?
- Solid copy, Commander.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.234
We're gonna find him.

37:43.640 --> 37:44.756
Seg.

37:46.760 --> 37:47.876
Lyta.

38:07.360 --> 38:09.113
We're close!

38:23.000 --> 38:24.957
We're not gonna
stop looking.

38:26.600 --> 38:29.434
There's skimmer dust-off
markings back there.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.716
Looks fresh.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.473
Scan for a heat signature.

38:38.200 --> 38:39.759
This will revive him.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.714
We need you alive,

38:48.880 --> 38:51.315
so you can tell us where
you took that Cythonnite woman.

38:54.320 --> 38:56.630
You have no idea
how important she is.

39:01.720 --> 39:04.997
She holds the key
