WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:03.402
<i> Previously on</i> Scorpion...
You married Happy.

00:03.404 --> 00:05.537
It was six years ago;
his visa was up.

00:05.539 --> 00:06.772
If I divorce him now

00:06.774 --> 00:09.041
before he has citizenship,
he'll be deported,

00:09.043 --> 00:11.143
Walter's gone,
Scorpion over.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.579
But I kind of need
that divorce now,

00:13.581 --> 00:14.780
because I'm pregnant.

00:16.150 --> 00:18.183
Help you?
I am looking for
Walter O'Brien.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.119
Who's asking?

00:20.121 --> 00:22.755
Joyce Linehan. I'm with U.S.
Citizenship and Immigration,

00:22.757 --> 00:25.024
and I am going to be
handling your case.

00:26.327 --> 00:29.094
Today's mission? It's perilous.

00:29.096 --> 00:31.463
The adversary is our worst yet.

00:31.465 --> 00:34.066
A nuclear threat?
An evil dictator?

00:34.068 --> 00:35.200
We wish.

00:35.202 --> 00:36.735
It's a pencil-pushing
bureaucrat.

00:36.737 --> 00:39.338
So, guys,
we take this seriously.

00:39.340 --> 00:40.606
HAPPY: Just take
the picture, dimwit.

00:40.608 --> 00:43.709
Apple, little closer
to Sir Isaac Newton, please.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.477
Okay, hurry up;
this kid I'm cooking

00:45.479 --> 00:47.613
will be birthed by the
time you take the picture.

00:47.615 --> 00:50.082
I can't hold this smile
much longer.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.316
Smile? Looks like he's...

00:51.318 --> 00:53.285
Enduring a medical exam
for men over 40?

00:55.623 --> 00:57.489
Next costume!
(sighs)

00:57.491 --> 00:59.591
I get this isn't
mentally taxing,

00:59.593 --> 01:01.593
but, guys,
Linehan's first impression

01:01.595 --> 01:03.228
of your marriage
was... Happy?

01:03.230 --> 01:04.463
Not good.
So, if you want her

01:04.465 --> 01:06.165
to buy marital bliss,
you need to fake more

01:06.167 --> 01:07.366
than just your
Halloween history.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.435
So, you'll need to show
some real emotion.

01:09.437 --> 01:10.453
How do we know
she's coming?

01:10.454 --> 01:11.470
I thought her visits
were unscheduled.

01:11.472 --> 01:12.738
First time she showed up,

01:12.740 --> 01:15.340
I spoofed her cell,
checked her calendar.

01:15.342 --> 01:18.310
Now, would that be a state crime
or an additional federal offense

01:18.312 --> 01:19.311
on top of the
fraudulent marriage?

01:19.313 --> 01:20.512
Both.
Great.

01:20.514 --> 01:21.747
Well, the federal crimes
are nearly over.

01:21.749 --> 01:22.748
We've done our homework.

01:22.750 --> 01:24.083
Happy's favorite
Halloween dance:

01:24.085 --> 01:25.084
The Halloween Hustle.

01:25.086 --> 01:26.452
Favorite candy: Nerds.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.087
And favorite monster:

01:28.089 --> 01:29.521
Frankenstein.

01:29.523 --> 01:31.356
He's held with nuts and bolts.

01:31.358 --> 01:33.459
And, Happy, what about Walter?

01:33.461 --> 01:34.860
Walter's favorite
Halloween beverage is water.

01:34.862 --> 01:36.728
Beyond that, I have no idea.

01:36.730 --> 01:38.597
He won't make anything up.
WALTER: Come on,

01:38.599 --> 01:39.698
let's get this
over with.

01:44.171 --> 01:46.805
Uh, maybe you could save
that costume for our honeymoon.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.407
Can it and take
the photos.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.408
Come on, let's go.

01:49.410 --> 01:50.509
Over here.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.177
Picture by the desk.

01:52.179 --> 01:55.214
Now, Walter, people in love know
details about their partner,

01:55.216 --> 01:57.483
so what did you do for Halloween
when you were a kid?

01:57.485 --> 01:59.118
We didn't celebrate
in Ireland.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.452
Aw, that's a shame.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.687
You know, I've always
loved Halloween.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.455
It's a chance to be
whoever you want.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.190
I used to take
my dad's letterman's jacket,

02:05.192 --> 02:07.226
I'd put it on,
and I'd slick my hair back,

02:07.228 --> 02:08.961
pretend to be cool.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.695
That has me a second away
from breaking into tears.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.164
My self-image has
evolved, thank you.

02:12.166 --> 02:14.366
Now I spend Halloweens
at The Warlock's Chest

02:14.368 --> 02:16.752
for games night.

02:16.753 --> 02:19.137
Which reminds me, I need
to set an alarm on my phone

02:19.140 --> 02:21.173
for the Super Fun Guy
Halloween Special.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.342
Sometimes we get so wrapped
up in the ten-sided die,

02:23.344 --> 02:25.444
we lose track of time.

02:25.446 --> 02:27.312
And that made it worse.

02:27.314 --> 02:29.615
Guys, we need normal
Halloween stories.

02:29.617 --> 02:30.816
Anyone?

02:30.818 --> 02:32.518
You're the human.
Regale us.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.720
(camera clicking)

02:34.722 --> 02:36.455
All pretty standard.

02:36.456 --> 02:38.189
Uh, Mom made theme costumes
for the family:

02:38.192 --> 02:39.825
Igor, Frankenstein,
Bride of Frankenstein.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.660
We'd trick-or-treat
together,

02:41.662 --> 02:43.662
um...

02:43.664 --> 02:45.330
hand out candy,
and it was fun.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.532
WALTER:
I cannot comprehend

02:46.534 --> 02:49.268
an evening spent that way
with my family.

02:49.270 --> 02:52.504
Walter, we need something
to make you... human.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.541
PAIGE:
Ralph.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.242
Ralphy.

02:57.244 --> 02:59.211
You're supposed
to help decorate,

02:59.213 --> 03:01.213
not help yourself
to the decorations.

03:01.215 --> 03:02.281
By stacking
the candy corn kernels,

03:02.283 --> 03:03.315
it actually resembles
a corn cob.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.316
It's so simple and logical.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.584
Candy. Corn.

03:05.586 --> 03:07.452
And I think you're done
with the candy.

03:07.454 --> 03:09.521
No more sugar. Come on.

03:10.691 --> 03:11.723
I'm not sure
I can pull this off.

03:11.725 --> 03:13.692
I'm finding that...

03:13.693 --> 03:15.660
(whispers): faking emotion
is nearly impossible.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.963
Pal, you specialize in
the nearly impossible.

03:17.965 --> 03:20.232
The first step is to
not beat yourself up.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.533
Faking emotion
is a hard chore

03:21.535 --> 03:23.302
even for the most
naturally demonstrative.

03:23.304 --> 03:25.304
You saw how bad
a job Paige did.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.538
What?

03:26.540 --> 03:28.307
Sometimes I forget
how much more I see

03:28.309 --> 03:29.675
as a brilliant behaviorist.

03:29.677 --> 03:31.510
Her Halloween story?

03:31.512 --> 03:33.212
The short,
fragmented sentences,

03:33.214 --> 03:35.280
'cause people like to get
through lies quickly.

03:35.282 --> 03:36.481
And she scratched her nose,

03:36.483 --> 03:37.916
which contains erectile tissue
that expands

03:37.918 --> 03:40.819
because blood rushes to
the head and brain when lying.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.554
Her tale of
matching costumes

03:42.556 --> 03:44.256
and family night?

03:44.258 --> 03:45.691
It's phony baloney.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.793
Why would she, of all people,
fabricate a story?

03:47.795 --> 03:49.295
Well, think about it:

03:49.296 --> 03:50.796
You have a terrible relationship
with your parents,

03:50.798 --> 03:52.431
Sly's dad is a dictator,

03:52.433 --> 03:54.266
my mom's bat poop crazy,

03:54.268 --> 03:56.335
Happy was in foster care;
we talked about this.

03:56.337 --> 03:58.270
Paige?
She's just a stranger

03:58.272 --> 03:59.571
we took from a diner.

03:59.573 --> 04:03.508
We know nothing,
except that she just lied.

04:03.510 --> 04:04.943
Maybe her upbringing
was<i> lupinus.</i>

04:04.945 --> 04:07.412
I highly doubt
she was raised by wolves.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.314
Well, there's something
she's ashamed of.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.652
All right, team, gear up!

04:13.654 --> 04:15.420
We're moving out in five.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.655
Who are you,

04:16.657 --> 04:17.723
Belushi in
<i> Animal House?</i>

04:17.725 --> 04:18.724
Who?

04:18.726 --> 04:20.292
Never mind.

04:20.294 --> 04:21.627
Cabe, are you here
for the party?

04:21.629 --> 04:23.695
What's in the bags?
Decorations?

04:23.697 --> 04:24.863
We have a mission.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.583
What? No.

04:27.584 --> 04:30.302
We have candy and costumes,
and we're gonna have a party.

04:30.304 --> 04:31.436
And the Knights
of West Altadena

04:31.438 --> 04:33.705
will be playing

04:33.706 --> 04:35.973
Fantasies and Frolics
at The Warlock's Chest.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.576
You didn't tell him?

04:37.578 --> 04:38.844
You know how he gets.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.812
What's going on?

04:40.814 --> 04:45.017
Kid, we're going to a remote
location outside of Tempe,

04:45.019 --> 04:47.552
where we're spelunking
to save bats.

04:47.554 --> 04:50.789
I am not spelunking to save
a disease-ridden flying rodent.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.624
We all are, except for Happy,

04:52.626 --> 04:54.993
who's gonna QB us from
the garage speakerphone

04:54.995 --> 04:57.062
while she keeps an
eye on Ralphy-boy.

04:57.064 --> 04:58.764
I got it covered.

04:58.766 --> 05:00.465
Caves are dangerous
for pregnant women.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.501
Listeria grows
in the ubiquitous rat urine.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.536
Rat pee is dangerous
for anybody.

05:04.538 --> 05:05.537
Come on.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.572
There's nothing
to worry about.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.610
SYLVESTER:
<i> I am terribly worried.</i>

05:11.612 --> 05:13.879
I also resent that I wasn't
informed of this case sooner.

05:13.881 --> 05:15.447
We didn't want you
to freak out

05:15.449 --> 05:16.915
until it was
absolutely necessary.

05:16.917 --> 05:19.518
I resent that you assume
that I will freak out.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.053
Dude, you're checking your pulse
as we speak.

05:21.055 --> 05:22.354
WALTER:
Sly, we wouldn't be here

05:22.356 --> 05:25.090
unless it was
absolutely necessary.

05:25.092 --> 05:27.359
Like fate of the free world,
Sly, no joke.

05:27.361 --> 05:29.761
Yeah, well, I'm still waiting
on an explanation.

05:29.763 --> 05:32.631
The bats in this cave suffer
from WNS-- White Nose Syndrome.

05:32.633 --> 05:35.767
It's a fungal disease wiping out
bats from across Latin America

05:35.769 --> 05:36.768
to the U.S.

05:36.770 --> 05:38.687
This cave houses

05:38.688 --> 05:40.605
a particularly large population
from all across the continent,

05:40.607 --> 05:42.708
who come here
to breed and to hibernate.

05:42.710 --> 05:46.044
So, treating these bats will
have a large geographic reach.

05:46.046 --> 05:48.013
Bats are filthy animals.

05:48.015 --> 05:51.383
They are veritable flying sacks
of viruses.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.719
They're veritable flying,
insect-eating machines,

05:53.721 --> 05:54.886
natural insecticide,

05:54.888 --> 05:57.055
an amazing feat of
evolutionary biology,

05:57.057 --> 05:59.524
and the second most
important pollinator.

05:59.526 --> 06:00.992
Millions of them jam together
so tightly

06:00.994 --> 06:02.394
that they poop on one another.

06:02.396 --> 06:04.530
WALTER:
If WNS wipes out

06:04.531 --> 06:06.665
bat populations, it could
threaten Western civilization.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.734
I would love to hear that math.

06:08.736 --> 06:12.938
In Syria, a ten-year drought
ruined subsistence farming,

06:12.940 --> 06:15.574
so scores of young men
fled the countryside

06:15.576 --> 06:17.642
and moved to the
cities-- aimless youth,

06:17.644 --> 06:19.945
no jobs, no direction.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.080
It was the perfect breeding
ground for radicalization.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.850
If the bats
in this cave succumb to WNS,

06:24.852 --> 06:28.019
then they might not return home
to, say, Latin America.

06:28.021 --> 06:29.621
The insect population
will increase,

06:29.623 --> 06:31.523
and subsistence farming
will be ruined.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.058
I guess that math adds up.

06:33.060 --> 06:35.060
And we're not gonna be alone;
the zoologists who hired us

06:35.062 --> 06:36.428
are supposed to be
meeting us here.

06:36.430 --> 06:38.163
Yeah, Dr. Bryce
and Jody MacMillan.

06:38.164 --> 06:39.897
They went in earlier
to clear the cave of any hikers,

06:39.900 --> 06:41.833
and they'll meet us
in chamber one.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.969
This note on their truck...
HAPPY: Then giddy-up.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.171
You have a party to throw
and a bureaucrat to impress.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.106
Linehan will be at
the garage at 8:00,

06:48.108 --> 06:50.442
so let's not
miss our window.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.111
(snaps fingers)

06:52.112 --> 06:53.779
SYLVESTER: All right.
(stutters) E-Everybody wait.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.046
Why are we here?

06:55.048 --> 06:57.883
Can't the zoologists
save the bats?

06:57.885 --> 07:00.519
Uh, because the last time those
caves were properly surveyed

07:00.521 --> 07:03.722
was over 40 years ago, and due
to the limestone structure,

07:03.724 --> 07:05.490
they're what we called
"geologically fluid."

07:05.492 --> 07:06.758
TOBY:
Caverns that were there

07:06.760 --> 07:08.126
three weeks ago
might not be there today.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.861
WALTER:
And...

07:09.863 --> 07:12.597
I've designed
a laser mapping device

07:12.599 --> 07:15.734
to canvass the cave system,
calculating the square footage.

07:15.736 --> 07:17.569
You told me it was
a Halloween decoration!

07:17.571 --> 07:19.121
I lied. It's to work out

07:19.122 --> 07:20.672
the perfect placement
for the Fungiblaster.

07:20.674 --> 07:23.141
A flea bomb that'll aerosol
fungicide throughout the cave

07:23.143 --> 07:24.810
to kill the virus
causing White Nose,

07:24.812 --> 07:26.478
while leaving the bats unharmed.

07:26.480 --> 07:28.980
And do I want to know
its toxicity to humans?

07:28.982 --> 07:30.749
No.

07:30.751 --> 07:32.150
TOBY:
We'll have it on a timer,

07:32.152 --> 07:34.019
and we'll already have exited
when it goes off.

07:34.021 --> 07:36.588
Well, we can't exit until we
enter, so let's get going.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.756
Uh, bats have unique

07:37.758 --> 07:39.024
optical rods and cones.

07:39.026 --> 07:41.927
They're agitated by white light,
but not red.

07:41.929 --> 07:44.229
Stick these to your flashlights.

07:45.165 --> 07:48.033
(bats chirping quietly)

07:48.035 --> 07:50.669
(wings flapping)

07:54.942 --> 07:57.876
TOBY:
Now, this sensor disc

07:57.878 --> 08:01.546
will pick up disbursement
efficacies of the fungicide.

08:01.548 --> 08:03.849
CABE:
Step carefully.

08:03.851 --> 08:05.917
Supposed to drop off
in about 15 feet.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.919
TOBY:
Where's the zoologists?

08:07.921 --> 08:09.521
WALTER:
They might be further in,

08:09.523 --> 08:12.791
but calling for them
will only agitate the bats.

08:12.793 --> 08:15.060
PAIGE:
Wow. It's... It's dark.

08:15.062 --> 08:16.161
Really dark.

08:26.507 --> 08:29.674
My God, it's beautiful.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.877
WALTER: It's also a long way
to the bottom.

08:31.879 --> 08:35.113
So, let's keep moving.

08:36.083 --> 08:39.684
Elevator going down
to spooky town.

08:39.686 --> 08:42.687
CABE:
You guys, quit playing grab-ass

08:42.689 --> 08:45.056
and get over here...

08:45.058 --> 08:47.025
and get down this rope.

08:59.973 --> 09:02.307
(equipment beeping)

09:11.885 --> 09:13.885
HAPPY:
Receiving data.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.120
So, Sly,

09:15.122 --> 09:16.888
once Happy
collates the data,

09:16.890 --> 09:17.989
double-check the
calculations.

09:17.991 --> 09:19.257
It's one of
the reasons

09:19.259 --> 09:20.992
why we need you here.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.594
PAIGE:
Um, while we're waiting,

09:22.596 --> 09:24.062
how's it going with Ralph?

09:24.064 --> 09:25.997
How hard is it to handle
an 11-year-old genius?

09:25.999 --> 09:27.766
The kid can take
care of himself.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.000
He's a self-driving car.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.702
Yeah, well, those things
make me nervous.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.270
So does my son on three bags

09:32.272 --> 09:33.605
of candy corn.

09:33.607 --> 09:34.706
Genius brains process glucose

09:34.708 --> 09:35.707
faster than normal brains.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.008
Could cause
hyperactivity.

09:37.010 --> 09:38.343
Guys,

09:38.345 --> 09:40.779
he's under control.

09:40.781 --> 09:43.915
Okay, that cavern is scanned.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.918
Laser fluctuations show
micro currents

09:46.920 --> 09:49.020
blowing east to west
out of a bigger hollow

09:49.022 --> 09:50.088
about 40 yards away.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.123
Was that on the map?

09:52.125 --> 09:55.026
Not that I can see, but
the readings are what they are.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.963
I told you,
limestone shifts and changes.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.030
Okay, let's go.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.600
We got to scan
that hollow.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.704
CABE:
Step carefully.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.306
There's a two-foot-wide
chasm here.

10:08.308 --> 10:10.275
It's like a fault line.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.610
(grunts)

10:11.612 --> 10:14.946
TOBY:
Okay, we'll scan this hollow,

10:14.948 --> 10:16.915
then move on to the next cavern,

10:16.917 --> 10:20.785
and we'll be back in L.A.
sooner than we thought.

10:20.787 --> 10:22.187
(rocks rumbling in distance)

10:22.189 --> 10:23.722
What was that?

10:24.758 --> 10:25.924
I didn't hear
where it came from.

10:25.926 --> 10:28.059
It's crumbling limestone,
nothing more.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.362
Or some unknown evil unleashed

10:30.364 --> 10:32.664
after centuries
of lying dormant.

10:32.666 --> 10:33.865
You watch horror movies?

10:33.867 --> 10:35.166
I've seen the commercials.

10:35.168 --> 10:36.267
And if something bad
was going to happen,

10:36.269 --> 10:37.802
this would be the perfect spot.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.939
So, I am just going to sit
right over here...

10:40.941 --> 10:42.974
Quit being such a baby.
It was just a sound.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.377
Oh, because scary things
are always silent.

10:45.379 --> 10:47.345
Where's the logic in that, Cabe?

10:47.347 --> 10:49.080
(gasps) Cave zombie!

10:49.082 --> 10:51.783
PAIGE:
Oh! Oh, no! The laser!

10:51.785 --> 10:53.318
MAN: Help me!
Grab his hand!

10:53.320 --> 10:55.353
No! Push him back into hell!

10:55.355 --> 10:57.155
Guys? What's going on?

10:57.157 --> 10:59.691
TOBY:
Newton found the zoologist.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.227
(panting)

11:02.229 --> 11:04.229
W-We were attacked.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.363
You got a lot
of bites on you, Doc.

11:05.365 --> 11:07.699
Assume it was the bats
that attacked you?

11:07.701 --> 11:10.168
Man, you are sweating
something awful.

11:10.170 --> 11:11.836
You have to help my
wife. Promise me.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.171
Promise me you'll
help my wife.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.140
Add in rapid-fire
response speech.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.975
He's got the symptoms of rabies.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.443
BRYCE:
We found a new crack,

11:18.445 --> 11:20.712
led to an unexplored area.

11:20.714 --> 11:24.382
W-We followed it through to
make sure no hikers had gone in.

11:24.384 --> 11:26.718
And that's when
we were attacked.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.986
Doctor, where's your wife?

11:27.988 --> 11:29.187
I-I don't know.

11:29.189 --> 11:31.856
Sh-She fell down.
I-I couldn't reach her.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.324
SYLVESTER:
Instead of asking the rabid man,

11:33.326 --> 11:35.727
how about we check the
film on his harness cam?

11:35.729 --> 11:37.496
WALTER:
Great idea.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.264
Here, Sly, grab a cable,
and then hook it up

11:39.266 --> 11:40.432
to your tablet.

11:40.434 --> 11:41.733
Happy, you catch all this?

11:41.735 --> 11:43.334
Loud and clear. Not good.

11:43.336 --> 11:44.869
Ralph hear?

11:44.870 --> 11:46.403
No. I've patched your comms
into the speaker phone,

11:46.406 --> 11:48.006
and he's all the way
back in the kitchen.

11:48.008 --> 11:50.308
Okay, do me a favor:
don't-don't tell him, okay?

11:50.310 --> 11:51.876
I don't want him getting scared.

11:51.878 --> 11:53.745
Copy that.

11:53.747 --> 11:55.947
Okay, we're ready.

11:55.949 --> 11:58.016
(Bryce and Jody panting)

12:00.253 --> 12:01.986
BRYCE:
There's an entire world in here

12:01.988 --> 12:03.488
that no one's ever seen before.

12:03.490 --> 12:04.489
Look at them.

12:04.491 --> 12:05.790
(bats chirping)

12:05.792 --> 12:07.759
Follow me through here.

12:10.831 --> 12:15.900
BRYCE: Jody... what do you think
we should name this place?

12:15.902 --> 12:19.070
I think "bat cave's"
already taken.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.772
Whoa, you okay?

12:20.774 --> 12:23.074
Yeah. Just...

12:23.076 --> 12:25.076
(bats squawking)

12:25.078 --> 12:27.178
They're becoming
very active.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.347
I've never seen
behavior this aggressive.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.116
(bats squawking loudly)

12:31.118 --> 12:32.250
They're attacking!

12:32.252 --> 12:34.185
(yells)
Be careful!

12:34.187 --> 12:36.855
Take cover! Go back!

12:36.857 --> 12:39.457
Get off me! (grunts)

12:43.163 --> 12:45.263
Be careful!

12:45.265 --> 12:46.898
(screams)

12:46.900 --> 12:47.966
Jody!

12:47.968 --> 12:50.535
Can you hear me?!

12:50.537 --> 12:54.506
I hid under a ledge until
the bats went back to roosting.

12:54.508 --> 12:58.109
Then I-I wandered through
the cave until I heard you.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.177
See the white nose?

12:59.179 --> 13:00.912
The bat's infected with

13:00.914 --> 13:02.347
<i> Pseudogymnoascus destructans,</i>

13:02.349 --> 13:04.282
the fungus that causes
White Nose Syndrome.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.283
They all are.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.785
So how did Bryce get rabies?

13:06.787 --> 13:09.487
WNS compromises
the bats' immune system,

13:09.489 --> 13:11.523
makes them susceptible
to other diseases, like rabies,

13:11.525 --> 13:14.292
which makes them
more aggressive.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.494
WALTER: Must've slipped
and bumped into the cave wall.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.297
That knocked out the red filter,
exposing the white light.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.565
PAIGE:
That's why the bats attacked.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.933
SYLVESTER:
So, just to clarify,

13:21.935 --> 13:24.536
we are surrounded by
psychotic flying killers

13:24.538 --> 13:26.871
that will go off at the
slightest provocation.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.373
CABE:
Our mission is now twofold.

13:28.375 --> 13:31.075
First, we got to rescue Jody,
and then we got to get

13:31.077 --> 13:34.846
the Fungiblaster where it needs
to be so we can save the bats.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.815
Third, while getting Bryce
to a hospital.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.250
This guy is suffering
from a virulent rabies strain

13:39.252 --> 13:41.386
like Duvenhage, Kotonkan

13:41.388 --> 13:43.521
or Rochambeau; if he
doesn't get the right serum

13:43.523 --> 13:44.923
in the next half hour,

13:44.925 --> 13:46.825
he doesn't ever get
to trick-or-treat again.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.593
No, n-no. I have to
go back for my wife.

13:48.595 --> 13:49.861
PAIGE:
We'll find her.

13:49.863 --> 13:50.895
TOBY:
Happy, closest hospital?

13:50.897 --> 13:52.864
HAPPY:
I am working on it.

13:52.866 --> 13:53.998
CABE:
Good luck, Doc.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.133
TOBY:
You, too. Be safe.

13:55.135 --> 13:57.435
All right.

13:57.437 --> 14:01.206
We're gonna have to go
deeper in, find this woman.

14:02.576 --> 14:03.842
(grunting)

14:09.983 --> 14:11.216
SYLVESTER:
So...

14:11.218 --> 14:15.086
into the darkness
with the killer bats.

14:15.088 --> 14:17.522
This is how
every scary movie starts.

14:27.467 --> 14:29.300
Okay, Toby,
I just sent directions

14:29.301 --> 14:31.134
to East General, the closest
Level III trauma center.

14:31.137 --> 14:33.571
It's 25 minutes,
if you drive like a madman.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.641
I'm doing 78 on bald tires!

14:36.643 --> 14:38.977
(chuckles) That's funny.

14:38.979 --> 14:41.212
You're fun.
Thanks, buddy.

14:41.214 --> 14:44.082
And you're delirious, so just
keep it together until we can

14:44.084 --> 14:46.217
<i> get you to the hospital.</i>

14:46.219 --> 14:47.318
HAPPY:
Guys, I'm trying to calculate

14:47.320 --> 14:48.620
approximate cave system layouts

14:48.622 --> 14:50.221
based on where you've been
and 40 year-old data,

14:50.223 --> 14:53.157
but all I can tell you is:
watch your step.

14:56.429 --> 14:59.364
Hey, what's with the knife?

14:59.366 --> 15:02.166
I stenciled designs
on my pumpkins.

15:02.168 --> 15:03.468
It's a little dangerous.

15:03.470 --> 15:05.470
<i> No mas.</i>

15:05.472 --> 15:08.640
Am I smelling ammonia?
What is in that syringe?

15:08.642 --> 15:11.175
I'm inducing a simple
double replacement reaction

15:11.177 --> 15:13.978
that'll produce a
uniform outward force,

15:13.980 --> 15:16.247
displacing the weakened patterns
on the pumpkin surface.

15:16.249 --> 15:18.583
You're injecting the pumpkins
with explosive chemicals?

15:18.585 --> 15:21.052
So I can carve
four pumpkins at once.

15:21.054 --> 15:24.022
No exploding pumpkins!

15:45.412 --> 15:47.278
CABE:
You okay?

15:49.683 --> 15:52.216
(panting)

15:52.218 --> 15:54.218
WALTER: Happy, we need
to know the incline

15:54.220 --> 15:56.087
of the initial drop off.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.224
Uh, I'm looking
at your GPS signals.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.160
You're off the grid.

16:02.162 --> 16:04.329
Don't inject that pumpkin!

16:04.331 --> 16:05.964
What? Wh-What is
Ralph injecting?

16:05.966 --> 16:08.299
Nothing! All good over here.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.436
Uh, but regarding the cave,
I am out of ideas.

16:11.438 --> 16:15.173
CABE: Blind as bats in here,
pun intended.

16:15.175 --> 16:17.108
That's it.

16:17.109 --> 16:19.042
You're as blind as a bat,
so you need to act like bats.

16:19.045 --> 16:20.478
Echolocation.
Exactly.

16:20.480 --> 16:23.247
Cabe, pick up the biggest
rock that you can find,

16:23.249 --> 16:24.749
and throw it out
in front of you.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.751
And then, Sly, give
us a time to impact.

16:26.753 --> 16:29.087
Okay.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.022
(grunts)

16:31.758 --> 16:35.326
Here we go. (grunts)

16:35.328 --> 16:36.661
(rock clatters)

16:36.663 --> 16:38.062
1.43 seconds.

16:38.064 --> 16:39.597
That's about a 50-foot drop.

16:39.599 --> 16:43.468
Based on the polarimetric
asymmetry of the returning echo,

16:43.470 --> 16:45.437
I'd say that this decline,

16:45.438 --> 16:47.405
based on the likely underlying
geographic morphology,

16:47.407 --> 16:50.608
either lets us slide

16:50.610 --> 16:53.778
into the cavern,
or we fall 50 feet and die.

16:56.116 --> 16:58.449
But I'm 74% sure
it's option one.

16:58.451 --> 17:00.118
Not the best odds.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.119
Whoa!

17:01.121 --> 17:03.054
(screams)
SYLVESTER: Walter!

17:04.090 --> 17:06.691
(groans)

17:06.693 --> 17:08.092
Uh...

17:08.094 --> 17:10.128
Thanks for, um,
breaking my fall.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.429
My pleasure.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.664
HAPPY:
You guys all okay?

17:13.666 --> 17:15.500
Uh, yeah,
just a little banged up.

17:15.502 --> 17:17.101
(explosion, pumpkin splatters)

17:17.103 --> 17:19.170
PAIGE:
Wh-What was that?

17:21.775 --> 17:24.609
Just the TV.
Watching scary movies.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.611
Well, I need to make sure
it's okay for Ralph.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.746
What are you guys watching?

17:28.748 --> 17:32.083
I think it's the one
with that kid, Damien.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.691
The big clown out there
is gaining on us.

17:40.693 --> 17:43.294
I need you to stay with me,
okay, pal?

17:43.296 --> 17:45.830
Okay.

17:45.832 --> 17:49.133
But that clown can't have
any of my birthday cake.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.069
I can get you
all the birthday cake you want

17:51.071 --> 17:52.804
once we get you better.

17:52.806 --> 17:55.573
Right now I need you to
concentrate on what's real.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.842
And that's getting you
to the hospital.

17:57.843 --> 18:00.110
<i> And this truck has no GPS, and</i>
<i>these back roads have no signs.</i>

18:00.113 --> 18:02.146
You know this area!

18:02.148 --> 18:03.681
So, help me navigate.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.584
Okay.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.853
Right after
I get my birthday cake.

18:08.855 --> 18:10.088
I'll get it.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.290
Whoa! What the hell?!

18:13.259 --> 18:14.258
(tires screech)

18:14.260 --> 18:15.726
(gasps)

18:15.728 --> 18:18.229
I need you to keep it together,
man, all right?!

18:20.300 --> 18:22.767
Of course you're not all right.
Just stay here!

18:25.305 --> 18:27.738
(groans):
Oh!

18:27.740 --> 18:30.341
Happy, I need something medical
closer than the hospital.

18:30.343 --> 18:32.844
There is a small town clinic
a half a mile ahead.

18:32.846 --> 18:34.278
That help?

18:34.280 --> 18:36.514
Yeah, clinics in bat country
should have a supply

18:36.516 --> 18:38.483
of rabies serum on hand.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.784
I like you.
(sighs)

18:50.330 --> 18:52.530
SYLVESTER: We keep on moving
deeper into this cave,

18:52.532 --> 18:55.233
and there's still no sign
of the zoologist lady.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.701
Maybe she found her own way out.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.337
PAIGE: After being bitten
by bats? I doubt it.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.539
SYLVESTER: Okay, well, we still
don't know if we're even going

19:01.541 --> 19:02.907
in the right direction.

19:02.909 --> 19:04.709
Oh, yeah. We are.

19:04.711 --> 19:06.644
Look.

19:06.646 --> 19:08.346
Blood.

19:08.348 --> 19:11.883
That must be where Bryce and
Jody got attacked by the bats.

19:16.189 --> 19:18.222
And that's got to be the chute
Jody fell in.

19:18.224 --> 19:20.691
WALTER:
Jody? Jody?

19:20.693 --> 19:22.693
(bats chirping)

19:22.695 --> 19:24.729
She could be
unconscious by now.

19:24.731 --> 19:25.930
(bat squeaks)

19:25.932 --> 19:27.298
(gasps)

19:31.204 --> 19:34.405
We are not alone.

19:34.407 --> 19:36.807
CABE:
It's just like<i> The Birds.</i>

19:36.809 --> 19:38.643
Probably didn't see that film.

19:38.645 --> 19:39.744
Oh, I did.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.245
I thought it was about
ornithology,

19:41.247 --> 19:43.314
and I was
unpleasantly surprised.

19:43.316 --> 19:44.949
MAN (over ringtone):
It's time for fun!

19:44.951 --> 19:46.384
(alarm rings)

19:46.385 --> 19:47.818
Ringers are supposed
to be off.
It<i> is</i> off.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.655
This is my alarm for the
Super Fun Guy Halloween special.

19:50.657 --> 19:52.390
I was supposed to be
watching it this afternoon,

19:52.392 --> 19:53.791
instead of on a mission

19:53.793 --> 19:55.293
that you guys
didn't me about.

19:55.295 --> 19:56.294
WALTER (whispers):
Quiet!

19:56.296 --> 19:58.396
Guys...

19:58.398 --> 19:59.764
they're moving.

19:59.766 --> 20:00.765
(bats squawking)

20:00.767 --> 20:03.367
What's moving?

20:03.369 --> 20:07.438
(screaming):
Bats...!

20:08.608 --> 20:09.974
Everyone, this way!

20:09.976 --> 20:11.709
(Sylvester gasping)

20:11.711 --> 20:13.744
(grunts)

20:14.681 --> 20:16.347
(rocks clattering)

20:18.284 --> 20:20.251
(shrieking)

20:20.253 --> 20:21.419
This is my nightmare!

20:21.421 --> 20:23.487
This is my
actual nightmare!

20:25.458 --> 20:26.891
SYLVESTER:
Cabe, get under here!

20:27.827 --> 20:29.860
CABE:
I'm under!

20:29.862 --> 20:31.495
(bats continue squawking)

20:31.497 --> 20:33.297
They're not stopping!

20:35.468 --> 20:36.534
SYLVESTER:
Happy!

20:36.536 --> 20:37.969
Trip the fire alarm!

20:37.971 --> 20:39.537
Turn the alarm on? Why?

20:39.539 --> 20:40.938
Because high-pitched noises

20:40.940 --> 20:42.573
repel bats!

20:42.575 --> 20:44.308
(smoke alarm beeping)

20:44.310 --> 20:45.576
Hey!

20:45.578 --> 20:47.511
What are you doing?!

20:47.513 --> 20:49.547
You said you wanted
the alarm turned on.

20:49.549 --> 20:52.016
Get down before
you break your neck!

20:52.018 --> 20:53.851
But first hold this
phone to the alarm.

20:53.853 --> 20:55.720
Is something going on?

20:55.722 --> 20:57.955
Halloween prank on Sly.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.924
Sweet.

21:02.262 --> 21:04.362
(beeping continues)

21:04.364 --> 21:06.330
(squawking stops)

21:06.332 --> 21:08.032
It worked.

21:08.034 --> 21:09.567
(beeping stops)

21:12.338 --> 21:13.638
Is everyone okay?

21:13.640 --> 21:14.839
(grunts)

21:14.841 --> 21:16.340
CABE:
Sound off.

21:16.342 --> 21:19.410
(panting): We're fine,
but we're... we're cut off.

21:19.412 --> 21:20.778
We can't get back to you.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.980
(panting): You know,
we're gonna have to

21:22.982 --> 21:24.548
go deeper
into the cave,

21:24.550 --> 21:26.851
see if we can find an exit.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.586
HAPPY: I will look
for geological formations

21:28.588 --> 21:30.521
that might signal a way out.

21:33.393 --> 21:35.593
This looks like the ravine
in Bryce's video.

21:35.595 --> 21:38.562
(whispering):
Jody? Jody?
Jody?

21:38.564 --> 21:40.598
I don't see her.

21:40.600 --> 21:42.033
Yeah, well, she's got to be
down here somewhere.

21:42.035 --> 21:44.869
Yeah. Only one way to find out.

21:44.871 --> 21:46.904
Rappel down. Get your rope out.

21:48.775 --> 21:50.908
TOBY: All right,
we're almost there.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.977
Just a few more steps.

21:52.979 --> 21:56.047
Just a few more
steps, huh?

21:57.784 --> 21:59.317
Are you kidding me?!

22:00.586 --> 22:01.652
(Toby grunts)

22:01.654 --> 22:03.621
(Bryce groans)

22:07.727 --> 22:09.026
Happy, the clinic's locked,

22:09.028 --> 22:11.028
and this guy's dead
if I don't get him serum.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.731
Okay, take a bobby pin and I can
walk you through the lock pick.

22:13.733 --> 22:15.933
I always wear a hat.
Why would I have a bobby pin?

22:15.935 --> 22:18.336
I-I don't know.
I'm thinking.

22:18.338 --> 22:20.071
Ralph, please!

22:20.073 --> 22:22.073
She's teaching me to tango.

22:22.075 --> 22:24.342
Doc?

22:24.344 --> 22:26.410
Doc, I'm having trouble
hearing you.

22:26.412 --> 22:27.845
Never mind.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.381
There's your bobby pin!

22:38.358 --> 22:39.890
You know how to do this?

22:39.892 --> 22:42.827
Yeah. I watched a
spelunking video.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.773
See, the trick is
to manage your speed

22:55.775 --> 22:57.141
so that you don't descend too...

22:57.143 --> 22:58.943
(whoops)

22:58.945 --> 23:00.378
That was fun.

23:00.380 --> 23:02.980
Um... yeah.

23:04.384 --> 23:08.119
Oh, I got to tighten
your lightbulb.

23:08.121 --> 23:10.521
Oh.

23:10.523 --> 23:11.522
Turn.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.124
Just... okay.

23:15.061 --> 23:16.660
What's that look?

23:16.662 --> 23:18.813
Hmm?

23:18.814 --> 23:20.965
I was just thinking
about my dad.

23:20.967 --> 23:23.000
He was adept at
fixing lights.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.803
When the headlamps on his
combine malfunctioned,

23:25.805 --> 23:28.572
he would correct
it within minutes.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.475
What about your dad?

23:32.445 --> 23:34.578
Well, he certainly wasn't

23:34.580 --> 23:35.980
fixing combines.

23:35.982 --> 23:37.681
Why-why do you ask?

23:37.683 --> 23:38.883
Huh?

23:40.520 --> 23:42.119
Toby said that
you were untruthful

23:42.121 --> 23:45.823
about how you spent
Halloween with your family.

23:45.825 --> 23:48.859
Is that... correct?

23:48.861 --> 23:51.429
Only-only 'cause I know
you're not a deceitful person,

23:51.431 --> 23:54.865
so, logically... you lied,

23:54.867 --> 23:57.802
then something's
bothering you and...

23:57.804 --> 23:59.870
that bothers me.

24:04.510 --> 24:08.546
My dad was a good man,
um, but my mom...

24:08.548 --> 24:09.847
had some trouble.

24:09.849 --> 24:14.084
When she, um,
left him, it...

24:14.086 --> 24:15.953
he was crushed.

24:15.955 --> 24:18.456
She was the love of his life.

24:18.458 --> 24:21.625
So, for Halloween, he'd buy
a gross bag of no-name candy

24:21.627 --> 24:24.895
from the dollar store

24:24.897 --> 24:27.965
and leave it in a basket and
turn off all the house lights,

24:27.967 --> 24:31.101
and so he'd... no one
would think we were home.

24:31.103 --> 24:34.472
And then, uh, we'd sit
on the couch together

24:34.474 --> 24:37.808
and watch<i> It's the Great</i>
<i> Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.</i>

24:39.779 --> 24:41.745
You never went out
with the other kids?

24:43.749 --> 24:45.716
Seeing families
having fun together,

24:45.718 --> 24:47.585
that was just too much for him.

24:50.623 --> 24:53.023
I lied. Sorry.

24:53.025 --> 24:55.759
No.

24:55.761 --> 24:56.894
All right.

24:56.896 --> 24:58.762
We have work to do.

25:01.934 --> 25:04.201
Bryce? Bryce?

25:04.203 --> 25:05.202
Stay awake.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.204
(Bryce groaning)

25:07.206 --> 25:09.173
Ooh, Frankenstein noises.
That's good.

25:09.175 --> 25:10.774
Means your brain's
still working.

25:10.776 --> 25:12.176
So, even though
you can't understand me,

25:12.178 --> 25:14.512
I'm gonna keep talking to you.

25:14.514 --> 25:17.047
My voice will keep your brain
active, so that you can

25:17.049 --> 25:18.666
fight off the virus.

25:18.667 --> 25:20.284
You know what happens when
rabies reaches your brain?

25:20.286 --> 25:22.620
You die. And that's bad.

25:22.622 --> 25:26.023
Um... rabies serum,
rabies serum...

25:26.025 --> 25:27.725
Rabies serum.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.660
Okay.

25:29.662 --> 25:32.663
Spotted bat,
Mexican long-tongued,

25:32.665 --> 25:33.864
Townsend's big-eared.

25:33.866 --> 25:37.635
Ten vials, ten species,
ten strains of rabies.

25:37.637 --> 25:39.937
Problem is, if I pick
the wrong one, you also die,

25:39.939 --> 25:41.539
so I got to choose
very carefully.

25:41.541 --> 25:43.140
(groans loudly)
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

25:43.142 --> 25:44.742
I am hurrying!

25:44.744 --> 25:46.677
Uh, so you didn't get bit
by a coyote,

25:46.679 --> 25:49.179
raccoon or fox.

25:49.181 --> 25:50.648
(groans)
Shh.

25:50.650 --> 25:54.618
Um, okay, that leaves
seven species of bat.

25:54.620 --> 25:55.719
Video footage.

26:00.927 --> 26:02.192
(groans)

26:02.194 --> 26:04.028
Uh, okay.

26:04.030 --> 26:07.631
Uh, brown fur,
round nose.

26:07.633 --> 26:09.767
(vocalizing)

26:09.769 --> 26:12.603
And four left. Um...

26:12.605 --> 26:15.139
Come on, I need
wing structure!

26:15.141 --> 26:17.875
Uh, Sly, you're not
gonna like this,

26:17.877 --> 26:20.311
but I need your photographic
memory to pluck a bat

26:20.313 --> 26:22.746
that looks exactly like
the one in Bryce's video.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.215
CABE: Open your eyes
and find a damn bat.

26:25.217 --> 26:27.952
They are disgusting. (groans)

26:27.954 --> 26:30.087
CABE: They're more afraid of you
than you are of them.

26:30.089 --> 26:32.656
I don't believe that's true.

26:37.663 --> 26:39.513
(Walter chuckles)

26:39.514 --> 26:41.364
I think we're getting
closer to finding Jody.

26:41.367 --> 26:42.800
We are?
Yeah.

26:42.802 --> 26:44.368
Glowworms.

26:44.370 --> 26:45.970
They're amazing creatures.

26:45.972 --> 26:49.073
Luciferin's the chemical
that makes them illuminate.

26:49.075 --> 26:50.741
But they only live
in wet conditions,

26:50.743 --> 26:52.109
so water must be nearby.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.677
And Jody's a zoologist,

26:53.679 --> 26:55.245
so she knew where
there's running water,

26:55.247 --> 26:56.714
there might be a way out.

26:56.716 --> 26:57.982
Look, there's another worm.

26:57.984 --> 26:59.917
And here are drag marks.

26:59.919 --> 27:01.852
I think she went
through here.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.253
PAIGE: Through that
tiny crevice?
Yeah.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.723
Well, cavers
call them "squeeze."

27:05.725 --> 27:07.358
Well, if Jody can do it,
we can, too. We have to.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.392
She needs us, right?

27:08.394 --> 27:10.361
There's no other way out.

27:10.363 --> 27:12.997
Ladies first.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.898
Yeah.

27:18.337 --> 27:20.871
(whimpering)

27:20.873 --> 27:23.874
Oh. Stop.

27:23.876 --> 27:25.376
The bats are right
above my head.

27:25.378 --> 27:27.411
(whispering):
All right, just get to it.

27:29.348 --> 27:31.015
Don't mind me.

27:31.017 --> 27:34.852
I'm just a friendly,
giant bat with glasses.

27:34.854 --> 27:36.854
(Sylvester whimpering)

27:39.425 --> 27:41.158
Oh, Cabe, I got it.

27:41.160 --> 27:43.127
Cabe, I got it. Bring me down.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.232
Great. What's the bone structure
of the wing?

27:48.234 --> 27:49.366
Three bones or five?

27:49.368 --> 27:51.101
I'm about to look.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.169
(exhales)

27:55.241 --> 27:57.174
Five bones in the wing.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.776
And the winner is...

27:58.778 --> 28:01.311
lesser leaf-nosed bat

28:01.313 --> 28:03.814
carrying the Lyssavirus
type three!

28:03.816 --> 28:05.049
Well done, kid.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.350
Good work, Sly.

28:06.352 --> 28:08.452
You saved his life.

28:08.454 --> 28:11.789
You know, he's actually
not that bad.

28:11.791 --> 28:14.191
I mean, he helped me
save somebody's life today.

28:14.193 --> 28:16.160
Hey, there, Mr. Bat.

28:16.162 --> 28:17.461
You're actually kind of cute.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.329
You want to be a part
of Team Scorpion?

28:19.331 --> 28:21.331
Me and Ferret Bueller...

28:21.333 --> 28:24.001
(bat hisses, Sylvester screams)

28:24.003 --> 28:26.837
The bastard bit me!

28:32.144 --> 28:34.778
SYLVESTER:
Man down! Man down!

28:34.780 --> 28:36.263
Don't worry, Sly.

28:36.264 --> 28:37.747
I'll have rabies serum to you
soon enough.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.388
More glowworms.

28:44.390 --> 28:47.157
WALTER (grunting): Must be
close to a water source.

28:47.159 --> 28:50.894
Happy, any luck
finding a way out?

28:50.896 --> 28:53.063
I am looking through satellite
images of those mountains

28:53.065 --> 28:54.932
in the winter.

28:54.933 --> 28:56.800
Sometimes snow can reveal
a sinkhole or hot spring

28:56.802 --> 28:58.202
or some other sign of a way out.

28:58.204 --> 28:59.203
Nothing so far.

28:59.205 --> 29:00.871
(groaning)

29:00.873 --> 29:03.440
But I'm still
working on it.

29:03.442 --> 29:06.110
Did you have more candy?

29:06.112 --> 29:07.911
A lot more.

29:07.913 --> 29:10.114
Uh...

29:10.116 --> 29:13.217
uh... hang on there.

29:13.219 --> 29:15.052
(phone ringing)

29:15.054 --> 29:16.954
Hello?

29:16.955 --> 29:18.855
Hey, Happy. I'm calling you
on your cell phone,

29:18.858 --> 29:20.858
so Paige can't hear us
on the party line.

29:20.860 --> 29:21.959
How's babysitting?

29:21.961 --> 29:23.227
You sounded stressed today.

29:23.229 --> 29:24.828
I'm a little on edge.

29:24.830 --> 29:26.497
Ralph's almost killed himself
a few times.

29:26.499 --> 29:27.765
Now he's nauseous.

29:27.767 --> 29:29.267
Normally, it wouldn't bother me,

29:29.268 --> 29:30.768
but now I'm worried
about every move he makes.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.803
Well, maternal instincts
are kicking in.

29:32.805 --> 29:34.371
It's the natural
mothering process.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.006
It's like wider hips,

29:36.008 --> 29:37.875
crepy skin
and your hair falling out.

29:37.877 --> 29:39.510
That is not helping my mania.

29:39.512 --> 29:41.478
See ya.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.247
<i> I was gonna give you</i>
<i> this present tonight,</i>

29:43.249 --> 29:45.048
<i> but in front of the Airstream,</i>
<i> under a tarp,</i>

29:45.050 --> 29:46.350
is something I built for you.

29:46.352 --> 29:48.252
Okay, I don't have time
for surprises.

29:48.254 --> 29:49.253
There's always
time for surprises.

29:49.255 --> 29:50.254
Do I have to look now?

29:50.256 --> 29:52.256
Yeah, right after you tell me

29:52.258 --> 29:54.158
how to hot-wire a Ranchero.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.862
(grunting)

30:00.366 --> 30:01.965
I made it.

30:01.967 --> 30:03.333
I'm through.

30:05.404 --> 30:07.571
I think I found Jody.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.206
WALTER:
Oh, great.

30:09.208 --> 30:11.275
Yeah, it's her.

30:13.212 --> 30:15.012
Okay.

30:15.014 --> 30:16.113
Oh, man.

30:16.115 --> 30:18.248
She's not bitten
as badly as Bryce,

30:18.250 --> 30:20.517
but she's very sick.
Is there water?

30:20.519 --> 30:23.187
Yeah, just a stagnant pond...

30:23.189 --> 30:25.222
that won't lead to an exit.

30:25.223 --> 30:27.256
We have to figure out a way
to get Jody out of here.

30:28.327 --> 30:30.194
(grunts loudly)

30:33.532 --> 30:35.532
Oh, no.
Oh, no, Paige.

30:35.534 --> 30:36.967
The Fungiblaster.

30:36.969 --> 30:39.102
It broke. And it's spewing gas.

30:39.104 --> 30:40.404
You mean the incredibly
toxic fungicide?

30:40.406 --> 30:41.906
The one that kills humans?

30:41.907 --> 30:43.407
Yes, and given the confines
of this space,

30:43.409 --> 30:44.909
we have roughly ten minutes

30:44.910 --> 30:46.410
before we see how effective
it really is!

30:46.412 --> 30:48.412
(grunts)

30:48.414 --> 30:51.248
Solid rock.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.151
Solid rock!

30:54.153 --> 30:55.252
HAPPY:
You climbed down,

30:55.254 --> 30:56.587
then curved to the southwest.

30:56.589 --> 30:58.589
That put you closer
to the outside walls,

30:58.591 --> 31:01.491
but you still have two and
a half feet of solid granite

31:01.493 --> 31:03.043
between you and blue sky.

31:03.044 --> 31:04.594
Great. All we have to do
is figure out a way

31:04.597 --> 31:06.330
out of an impenetrable dead end
in a few minutes.

31:06.332 --> 31:08.599
We need to see if she has
something we can use.

31:11.203 --> 31:13.337
Like a gigantic backhoe?

31:13.339 --> 31:14.571
That'd be useful right now.

31:14.573 --> 31:16.940
Here. A lighter.
Do you still have the candy

31:16.942 --> 31:17.941
that you took from Ralph?

31:17.943 --> 31:19.476
Yes.
Okay.

31:20.446 --> 31:21.478
Here.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.579
Great.

31:22.581 --> 31:24.214
Now...

31:24.216 --> 31:27.351
Paige, we need to scoop up
as much guano as we can.

31:27.353 --> 31:28.552
Guano. Right. You're...

31:28.554 --> 31:30.921
We're talking about the...
Bat feces.

31:30.923 --> 31:33.357
They have a high concentration
of nitrates.

31:33.359 --> 31:36.460
Combined with the sugar
in the candy,

31:36.462 --> 31:38.395
we can make an explosive

31:38.397 --> 31:39.463
and hopefully blow
through the limestone.

31:39.465 --> 31:41.231
Or kill the three of us.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.466
The more likely scenario,

31:42.468 --> 31:43.967
but death is guaranteed
if we don't.

31:43.969 --> 31:45.569
Give me the flares.

31:48.607 --> 31:52.409
Oh. Speaking of death,
I think I might be really close.

31:52.411 --> 31:54.912
I've got a 103 fever, minimum.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.613
Toughen up.
You got bit by one bat,

31:56.615 --> 31:59.149
and Toby's on the way
with the serum.

31:59.151 --> 32:00.951
TOBY:
<i> Hey-ho.</i>

32:00.953 --> 32:03.153
This Ranchero's a major beater.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.655
HAPPY:
<i> Go to the far side</i>

32:04.657 --> 32:07.257
of the mountain-- that's the
closest external approximation

32:07.259 --> 32:08.525
to Walter, Paige
and Jody's location.

32:08.527 --> 32:09.693
We got it!

32:09.695 --> 32:11.929
(engine revs)

32:11.931 --> 32:13.463
WALTER:
Okay.

32:13.465 --> 32:16.566
Now you take Jody
behind the boulder.

32:16.568 --> 32:19.136
Lift up for me.
I'm gonna pull you back.

32:19.138 --> 32:21.004
(Jody groans)

32:21.006 --> 32:22.539
That's fine.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.383
Okay, light the fuse!

32:54.039 --> 32:56.306
WALTER:
<i> Heads down! Brace yourselves!</i>

32:56.308 --> 32:58.675
Seven, six,

32:58.677 --> 33:03.013
<i> five, four, three,</i>

33:03.015 --> 33:05.215
<i> two, one! </i>
How the hell they gonna blow
through all that?

33:07.419 --> 33:08.652
Brace for debris!

33:12.691 --> 33:14.391
Am I hallucinating this?

33:15.361 --> 33:18.028
Oh, boy. Big kaboom!

33:18.030 --> 33:19.363
Walter?

33:19.365 --> 33:20.664
Paige?

33:22.634 --> 33:25.035
(coughing)

33:25.037 --> 33:27.004
(chuckles)
It worked. It worked.

33:27.006 --> 33:28.772
Why is it
still burning?

33:28.774 --> 33:31.174
Years of piled-up
guano are on fire.

33:31.176 --> 33:33.443
Here. Get her up.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.746
Get on the other
side of her.

33:40.252 --> 33:41.551
(Jody coughs)

33:44.790 --> 33:47.057
(panting)

33:51.463 --> 33:53.196
This is how every
scary movie ends.

33:53.198 --> 33:55.232
We've opened a portal to hell.

33:56.602 --> 34:00.137
Well... damn near normal.

34:00.139 --> 34:03.340
Hey, keep an eye out later,
just in case you start to,

34:03.342 --> 34:05.075
you know, crave blood.
Funny.

34:05.077 --> 34:06.844
If you do start to turn,

34:06.845 --> 34:08.612
I will drive a stake
through your heart personally,

34:08.614 --> 34:10.347
because we're pals.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.282
You're gonna be fine.

34:12.284 --> 34:14.618
Both of you. Actually,
all three. I spoke to Bryce.

34:14.620 --> 34:15.619
He's okay, too.

34:15.621 --> 34:17.054
The bats, too.

34:17.056 --> 34:18.672
The sensors we planted

34:18.673 --> 34:20.289
are showing wide disbursement
of the fungicide.

34:20.292 --> 34:21.458
So the bomb blast
must have created

34:21.460 --> 34:22.659
an artificial air current

34:22.661 --> 34:25.128
permeating every crevice
of the cave system.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.097
The granite walls of
the last cavern you were in

34:27.099 --> 34:28.365
took the brunt of the blast,

34:28.367 --> 34:29.499
so the limestone
didn't collapse.

34:29.501 --> 34:30.767
So we saved the bats.

34:30.769 --> 34:32.369
Did a lot more than that.

34:32.371 --> 34:34.137
Well, let's hurry up and
reunite Jody and Bryce

34:34.139 --> 34:35.338
and then get
to the airport.

34:35.340 --> 34:36.640
We've got a Halloween
party to start.

34:37.743 --> 34:39.242

35:50.182 --> 35:52.249

35:53.919 --> 35:58.455
Honestly, I was overwhelmed
with Ralph.

35:58.457 --> 36:00.323
Worried constantly.

36:00.325 --> 36:02.325
Yeah.

36:02.327 --> 36:04.694
That is a sign

Happy, thanks for

It's good for 'em.

36:36.895 --> 36:39.930
PAIGE: Did you tell 'em
what I told you to say?

36:39.932 --> 36:41.198
Yes.
Good.

36:42.601 --> 36:43.934
Nice boot and rally, kid.

36:43.936 --> 36:46.369

36:46.371 --> 36:47.504
Oh, hey, hey.

36:47.506 --> 36:49.639
I-I have, uh...

36:49.641 --> 36:52.375
I have a George Washington
costume collecting dust.

36:52.377 --> 36:54.778
After the INS agent
comes through,

36:54.780 --> 36:56.513
maybe it would make
your mom feel

36:56.515 --> 37:00.350
all good and Halloweeny
if you, me and she

37:00.352 --> 37:02.419
went out and...
PAIGE: Ralph, good news!

37:02.421 --> 37:04.254
Tim came home early
just to trick-or-treat with us.

37:04.256 --> 37:05.388
He's driving in
from the airport.

37:05.390 --> 37:08.358
Wh... What'd I interrupt?

37:08.360 --> 37:10.293
Walter wants to trick-or-treat
with us.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.862
No, Ralph,
what I was saying was that...

37:12.864 --> 37:16.266
I have a costume that
maybe you, me and your mom

37:16.268 --> 37:19.869
might donate to your-your
school's drama department.

37:19.871 --> 37:22.606
So... that sounds great.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.274
Sounds... odd.

37:24.276 --> 37:26.009
Is that really
what you wanted to say?

37:26.011 --> 37:27.310
Mm-hmm.

37:35.420 --> 37:37.787
Sweetheart. Sweetheart!

37:37.789 --> 37:38.989
Look who's here.

37:38.991 --> 37:40.957
So nice to see you again.

37:40.959 --> 37:43.026
You're having a party.

37:43.028 --> 37:45.429
That's fun.

37:45.430 --> 37:47.831
More for the kid,
but we all just love Halloween.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.332
Always have.

37:51.036 --> 37:53.436
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

38:03.315 --> 38:04.714
Candy corn?

38:04.716 --> 38:07.284
Candy corn's one of my favorite
memories of Halloween.

38:07.286 --> 38:09.486
What about you,
Happy?

38:09.488 --> 38:12.555
What's your favorite memory of
Halloween with your... husband?

38:12.557 --> 38:14.457
You know...

38:14.459 --> 38:15.458
um...

38:15.460 --> 38:17.994
I like dressing up with Walter.

38:17.996 --> 38:20.597
What's fun about that
for you as a couple?

38:20.599 --> 38:23.700
Yeah... um...

38:23.702 --> 38:25.435
costumes...
She does it for me.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.437
I-I'm the one
who likes to dress up

38:27.439 --> 38:28.471
and have these parties.

38:28.473 --> 38:29.739
I'm not a...

38:29.741 --> 38:32.342
I'm not a trick-or-treater,
per se.

38:32.344 --> 38:33.877
Isn't that right?

38:33.879 --> 38:34.844
Yep.

38:35.881 --> 38:37.848
When I was a boy,

38:37.849 --> 38:39.816
we would stay in every year,
pretend that no one was home

38:39.818 --> 38:42.085
and watch
<i> It's the Great Charlie Brown.</i>

38:42.086 --> 38:44.353
It's actually<i> The Great</i>
<i> Pumpkin, Charlie Brown.</i>

38:44.356 --> 38:46.489
Loved it.
Anyway, my friends thought

38:46.491 --> 38:48.358
that I was crazy
for not going out.

38:48.360 --> 38:50.393
But I knew the reason
why we stayed in

38:50.395 --> 38:53.496
was that my father didn't want
me running five houses ahead

38:53.498 --> 38:55.932
with my buddies,
while I tried to acquire

38:55.934 --> 38:58.835
as many double polysaccharide
nougat treats as possible.

39:01.707 --> 39:04.541
He wanted me home with him.

39:04.543 --> 39:08.044
He knew that when kids
get older, you lose them,

39:08.046 --> 39:11.815
so he wanted to spend
the time together.

39:11.817 --> 39:15.051
I didn't understand it then,
but I... I get it now.

39:15.053 --> 39:18.688
So... it's a favorite memory.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.093
Father sounds like
an interesting guy.

39:23.095 --> 39:25.995
He gets more interesting
all the time.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.598
You know, don't mind me.
I'm just gonna look around.

39:38.443 --> 39:39.576
That was Paige's story,

39:39.578 --> 39:41.644
reimagined to make her
feel warm and fuzzy.

39:41.646 --> 39:42.912
That's very acute of you.

39:42.914 --> 39:45.081
I just needed
something to say.

39:45.083 --> 39:46.750
I'm doing this
charade for you.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.618
It's not your job to make her
feel warm and fuzzy;

39:48.620 --> 39:49.886
it's Tim's job.

39:49.888 --> 39:52.155
Well, if I'm guilty of anything,
it's plagiarism.

39:52.157 --> 39:53.156
Nothing more.

39:53.158 --> 39:56.659
Dude, you're playing with fire.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.964
You know, I'm not gonna linger.

40:00.966 --> 40:02.966
Clearly, there's
a lot of love here.

40:02.968 --> 40:04.968
I mean, proton, electron...

40:04.970 --> 40:06.569
"Sunglasses at Night."

40:06.571 --> 40:07.637
Exactly!

40:07.639 --> 40:09.906
Clever. For 1985.

40:13.478 --> 40:16.846
You know, this album
is dated 2014

40:16.848 --> 40:19.849
and has a reflection
of that monitor over there,

40:19.851 --> 40:22.485
of that calendar
from 2016.

40:23.722 --> 40:25.722
That's funny.

40:25.724 --> 40:27.190
You know,
I took that picture,

40:27.192 --> 40:29.726
uh, but I must've put it
in the wrong album,

40:29.728 --> 40:31.895
'cause I had four
Nutsy Clusters...
Okay.

40:31.897 --> 40:33.897
...and, uh,
candy brain. Oh!

40:33.899 --> 40:35.532
LINEHAN: A genius
with candy brain.

40:35.534 --> 40:39.068
You know, a suspicious person
might think that

40:39.070 --> 40:41.738
things in this garage
were staged.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.106
Oh, no, absolutely not.

40:43.108 --> 40:45.074
I mean, you're not
a suspicious person.

40:45.076 --> 40:46.743
You're-you're a very
trusting person.

40:46.745 --> 40:47.877
I can tell.

40:47.879 --> 40:49.145
I'm a genius behaviorist.

40:49.147 --> 40:50.847
I'm not done here.

40:53.485 --> 40:54.484
Happy Halloween.

40:54.486 --> 40:55.919
TOBY:
Uh...

41:01.626 --> 41:04.928
TOBY:
Uh, she didn't buy it.

41:04.930 --> 41:06.996
Guys, we are in deep guano.
