01:07.810 --> 01:08.778
Damn it.

01:23.292 --> 01:25.996
What the goddamn?

01:29.799 --> 01:31.000
Shit.

01:36.806 --> 01:38.308
Anybody in there?

01:39.709 --> 01:43.147
You a crashed astronaut
or somethin'?

01:49.186 --> 01:53.157
Whoever you are,
you blew up my truck!

01:53.189 --> 01:54.557
You gonna get me another truck,

01:54.591 --> 01:56.594
and I'm gonna run
your ass over with it.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.771
I didn't mean that.

02:10.740 --> 02:13.143
We're good.

03:32.944 --> 03:37.047
<b>TERRORDACTYL</b>

03:38.329 --> 03:41.328
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

04:04.489 --> 04:05.625
Dude.

04:05.658 --> 04:07.494
Want to give me a hand?

04:07.526 --> 04:09.297
Jonas, how long do you think

04:09.329 --> 04:11.430
I can keep doing
this job by myself?

04:11.464 --> 04:12.533
Dude, I'm taking my break.

04:13.732 --> 04:15.368
I was mowing.

04:15.401 --> 04:16.570
Yeah, mowing what?

04:16.603 --> 04:18.305
The lawn.

04:18.338 --> 04:19.339
With what?

04:21.406 --> 04:22.910
Where's my lawn mower?

04:22.943 --> 04:24.679
Relax.
It's right over there.

04:27.648 --> 04:29.450
God damn it.

04:29.482 --> 04:31.652
Thought I finally got it
working this time.

04:35.689 --> 04:37.357
You know, I probably

04:37.390 --> 04:38.525
just need to change
something here.

04:38.559 --> 04:40.895
Break's over.

04:40.927 --> 04:44.231
Man, thought
I had it this time.

04:57.811 --> 05:00.580
You know, if you spent
half as much time on real work

05:00.614 --> 05:03.352
as you do with your things,

05:03.384 --> 05:04.585
you might actually make
some good money.

05:04.617 --> 05:05.820
Just saying.

05:05.853 --> 05:08.257
Lars, you've got
a business degree

05:08.290 --> 05:09.825
and you're planting shrubs
all day.

05:09.858 --> 05:12.026
Well, I mean, shrubs
don't crash on my couch

05:12.060 --> 05:13.629
for months on end,

05:13.661 --> 05:15.563
shrubs don't beg me
for a job after college,

05:15.596 --> 05:17.966
and shrubs definitely
don't drink all my beer.

05:17.999 --> 05:19.434
I like shrubs.

05:19.466 --> 05:21.603
Well, shrubs don't drive you home
after a long night at the bar,

05:21.636 --> 05:24.039
they don't help you get over
your latest and greatest breakup,

05:24.073 --> 05:26.641
and they don't fix your truck
for you when it's not working.

05:26.675 --> 05:28.009
All right, fine,
you got me there.

05:28.043 --> 05:31.413
All right, cool.
Fertilizer time!

06:18.661 --> 06:21.498
So I know that was my shovel,

06:21.530 --> 06:23.634
but, what is it now?

06:23.667 --> 06:24.934
-Dude, this?
-Yeah.

06:24.968 --> 06:26.436
This is my shov-brella.

06:29.537 --> 06:32.407
Check it out.

06:34.578 --> 06:37.315
Stay the hell away
from my leaf blower.

06:40.884 --> 06:43.119
Hey, so, five o'clock.

06:43.153 --> 06:45.022
Happy hour at the old
Watering Hole?

06:45.055 --> 06:48.492
No, dude, I just want to have a
few beers and pass out on my couch.

06:48.525 --> 06:49.727
But it's friday night.

06:49.759 --> 06:51.427
We always go out on
friday night.

06:51.461 --> 06:52.730
Yeah, well, I want to try
something different,

06:52.763 --> 06:54.598
like sleeping.

06:54.631 --> 06:56.600
Yeah.
Yeah, you're probably right.

06:56.632 --> 06:58.635
You know, you're probably
getting too old

06:58.669 --> 07:00.370
for that kind
of stuff anyway.

07:01.671 --> 07:02.740
Fine.

07:02.773 --> 07:05.810
But you're buying and driving.

07:05.842 --> 07:07.611
Deal.

07:42.948 --> 07:45.116
Wait till you see
my latest catch.

07:45.150 --> 07:48.887
Biggest, baddest, meanest river
son of a bitch you've ever seen.

07:49.919 --> 07:50.121
Evenin', Sampson.

07:50.155 --> 07:51.791
Don't you "evenin'" me, sonny.

07:51.823 --> 07:52.958
I'm a marine.

07:52.991 --> 07:54.627
This ain't just any evenin'.

07:54.660 --> 07:57.462
This is a goddamn celebration.

07:57.495 --> 07:58.864
And what'd you shoot this time?

07:58.896 --> 08:00.064
Shark!

08:00.097 --> 08:01.900
Right there in the river.

08:01.934 --> 08:05.103
It was much tougher than that
grizzly that I shot up in the Yukon.

08:05.136 --> 08:08.773
And he had me in his jaws
most of the time.

08:08.807 --> 08:11.143
Yeah, and what river
would this be?

08:11.175 --> 08:13.546
The L.A. River,
you damn civvy!

08:13.579 --> 08:15.146
Put ten slugs in him.

08:15.179 --> 08:18.117
Tired him out
till he went belly up.

08:18.150 --> 08:20.520
Just like the women in my bed.

08:20.553 --> 08:22.856
You know, one day, Sampson,
you're gonna sober up

08:22.889 --> 08:25.624
and hopefully not be
such a scumbag?

08:25.657 --> 08:27.727
Yeah, sad day that'll be.

08:31.896 --> 08:33.599
Nuts.

08:33.631 --> 08:36.135
Dude, I got to be honest.
I hate this place.

08:36.169 --> 08:37.770
What? I love it.

08:37.804 --> 08:39.206
I mean, the seats
are old as hell.

08:39.238 --> 08:41.207
The beer tastes like
it came out of the faucet.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.542
Come on.

08:42.573 --> 08:43.909
I don't even want to think

08:43.943 --> 08:45.478
about what these stains are
on this table.

08:45.512 --> 08:46.912
Dude, they wipe off.

08:46.945 --> 08:49.181
And that smell
is absolutely disgusting.

08:49.214 --> 08:51.050
Tell me what there is
to like about this place.

08:51.085 --> 08:52.719
Besides the obvious.

08:52.752 --> 08:53.719
What can I get you boys?

08:53.752 --> 08:54.654
How you doing, Candice?

08:54.687 --> 08:55.589
Hey, Lars, how are you?

08:55.622 --> 08:56.589
Hard day on the job?

08:56.622 --> 08:57.624
Yes, ma'am. That it was.

08:57.657 --> 08:59.191
What about you, Jonas?

09:00.927 --> 09:02.228
Well, I'm doing okay.

09:02.262 --> 09:05.232
You know, hardest day of
work ever, with, the...

09:07.171 --> 09:08.069
The sun.

09:08.101 --> 09:10.637
And we had the dirt and
the shovel and the shrub,

09:10.671 --> 09:13.574
and, you know, we got sweaty
with the work, and so...

09:13.606 --> 09:14.975
Yeah.

09:15.008 --> 09:17.077
Yeah, you're still sweating.

09:17.110 --> 09:19.111
Well, you know me.
I'm always sweating.

09:19.145 --> 09:22.048
Working! I'm always work...
Always working.

09:22.080 --> 09:24.051
So, how are you?

09:24.084 --> 09:25.686
'Cause it looks
a little slow tonight here.

09:25.719 --> 09:26.787
-You okay?
-Yeah.

09:26.820 --> 09:28.955
Everything slow?
Everything okay?

09:28.989 --> 09:30.959
Yeah, it's a slow one.

09:32.660 --> 09:33.895
What can I get you guys?

09:33.927 --> 09:35.096
Two IPAs, please.

09:35.129 --> 09:36.897
All right,
coming right up.

09:36.931 --> 09:38.901
-Man.
-Bro.

09:38.933 --> 09:41.234
-That was magic.
-Yeah?

09:41.268 --> 09:43.970
I could feel the sparks
coming off that.

09:44.003 --> 09:46.239
I think she's really
starting to dig you.

09:46.272 --> 09:47.875
Really, you think?

09:47.908 --> 09:49.576
The signs were all there.
I mean, think about it.

09:49.609 --> 09:50.946
When you started talking
about how much

09:50.979 --> 09:53.949
you sweat
and the shrubs you plant...

09:53.981 --> 09:56.249
come on, man,
why didn't you propose?

09:56.282 --> 09:57.885
Yeah, I'm a gentleman, okay?

09:57.918 --> 10:00.053
Take my time,
picking my moment,

10:00.086 --> 10:01.122
getting to know her a bit.

10:01.155 --> 10:02.722
Dude, you do know her.

10:02.755 --> 10:04.292
We come here
every friday night,

10:04.326 --> 10:06.894
and every friday night,
it's the same thing with you.

10:06.927 --> 10:11.933
You sit there, and you stutter, and you
get all jittery like a little teenager.

10:11.966 --> 10:13.835
No, don't eat that!

10:13.868 --> 10:15.137
Disgusting.

10:15.169 --> 10:16.271
Just ask her out.

10:16.303 --> 10:17.805
I'm working on it.

10:17.839 --> 10:19.175
Bro, if you don't say something,

10:19.207 --> 10:20.841
she's gonna end up
with that drunk Sampson.

10:26.182 --> 10:28.350
It ain't that hard, Jonas.

10:28.383 --> 10:31.153
Guess your balls just aren't
as big as that brain of yours?

10:31.186 --> 10:32.922
Lars, have you
looked at us lately?

10:32.954 --> 10:36.824
Come on, man, I'm dirty and
sweaty and, let's see, poor too.

10:36.857 --> 10:38.193
I mean, I can't
ask her out like this.

10:38.226 --> 10:39.761
I don't even have
a dollar to my name.

10:39.794 --> 10:41.363
It ain't respectable.

10:41.396 --> 10:44.031
Hard honest work,
that's respectable, Jonas.

10:44.065 --> 10:46.035
Why, because it's hard?
I mean, come on, man.

10:46.068 --> 10:47.971
There's got to be
a better way of making money

10:48.004 --> 10:50.139
than sweating our asses off
in rich pricks' lawns all day.

10:50.172 --> 10:53.611
Dude, as much as you may think,
money ain't always the answer.

10:53.644 --> 10:55.345
Sure as hell would solve
a lot of my problems right now.

10:55.377 --> 10:57.145
I mean, come on, man,
I want to do something big.

10:57.178 --> 10:58.648
I want to, you know,
do something great,

10:58.680 --> 11:00.083
live the dream!

11:00.117 --> 11:01.784
While you do that,
I'm gonna dream

11:01.817 --> 11:04.154
of cheap drinks
and cute waitresses.

11:05.154 --> 11:06.357
Here you guys go.

11:08.424 --> 11:09.793
Feeling better, Jonas?

11:09.825 --> 11:11.594
Yeah, I always feel good
around you.

11:13.030 --> 11:15.365
You can, throw these
on Jonas' tab.

11:15.398 --> 11:17.001
All right,
will do, hon.

11:17.034 --> 11:18.668
It's gonna be ten total.

11:18.702 --> 11:20.203
Man.

11:20.237 --> 11:21.703
Dude, I'm gonna need
to borrow ten bucks.

11:21.736 --> 11:23.340
Are you kidding me?

11:50.935 --> 11:53.036
Hey, sweet cheeks!

11:53.069 --> 11:56.205
When we gonna split
a bottle and a bed?

11:56.238 --> 11:59.242
I told you, Sampson,
I don't date customers.

11:59.275 --> 12:01.345
Honey,
after a couple drinks,

12:01.378 --> 12:03.748
you won't care who I am.

12:05.781 --> 12:08.718
Sampson, all the drinks
in the world couldn't do that.

12:08.751 --> 12:10.988
Well, it was worth a try.

12:18.095 --> 12:20.197
We will report
more as we follow this story.

12:20.230 --> 12:21.398
Watch your heads tonight.

12:21.431 --> 12:23.000
Astronomers
at Griffith Observatory

12:23.033 --> 12:25.136
are preparing
for a surprise meteor shower.

12:25.170 --> 12:26.871
The meteors,
which are expected

12:26.903 --> 12:28.906
to come down in the greater
Los Angeles area...

12:28.940 --> 12:31.476
-Here's your change.
-Thanks.

12:31.509 --> 12:33.177
...which brought
the planet a near miss

12:33.210 --> 12:35.714
with a meteor the size
of a six-story building

12:35.747 --> 12:37.950
that by all accounts seems
to have burned up on entry

12:37.983 --> 12:39.483
when it disappeared
from astronomers'...

12:39.517 --> 12:41.287
Love to get my hand
on one of those rocks.

12:41.320 --> 12:42.721
Make a bundle.

12:42.753 --> 12:43.922
What do you mean?

12:43.955 --> 12:46.090
Meteorites, meteors.

12:46.123 --> 12:48.126
You know, pretty cool.

12:48.159 --> 12:50.862
Stuff's been floating
around our galaxy for ages

12:50.896 --> 12:52.897
just collecting space dust.

12:52.931 --> 12:55.367
Then they just hit
our atmo and burn up

12:55.399 --> 12:57.869
like glittery diamonds.

12:57.902 --> 12:59.206
Yeah.

12:59.239 --> 13:02.141
You know, they hit Earth
on a regular basis.

13:02.173 --> 13:04.442
There's all kinds
of different rocks:

13:04.475 --> 13:06.845
irony rocks, stone rocks,
stony iron rocks.

13:06.878 --> 13:08.881
Irony ones are the ones
that are worth the most

13:08.914 --> 13:10.949
and easiest to find,
I guess.

13:10.983 --> 13:14.053
Other ones just look
like regular rocks.

13:14.085 --> 13:15.388
-But yeah.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:15.421 --> 13:16.489
I mean, the mete...

13:16.522 --> 13:17.989
The mete... meteoroids

13:18.023 --> 13:21.961
and the...
The glistening rocks

13:21.995 --> 13:23.394
and the night highway.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.831
I-I can't get...
I love them. I love them.

13:25.865 --> 13:27.166
I can't get enough of them.

13:27.199 --> 13:28.902
I mean, you certainly seem
to like them.

13:28.934 --> 13:31.771
Yeah, my cousin works
at the science museum.

13:31.804 --> 13:34.173
She says people pay
top dollar for space rocks.

13:34.206 --> 13:36.109
Really, that so?

13:36.142 --> 13:38.311
Some guy had one crash
into his living room a year ago.

13:38.344 --> 13:41.114
He was pissed as hell
until he sold it.

13:41.147 --> 13:43.016
Bought a brand-new house.

13:45.284 --> 13:46.820
Good to know.

13:50.223 --> 13:51.457
Thanks.

13:51.490 --> 13:52.894
Yeah.

13:56.930 --> 13:58.030
Hey, wake up, wake up, wake up.

13:58.063 --> 13:59.032
Come on, come on, come on.

13:59.065 --> 14:00.400
We got work to do.

14:02.403 --> 14:05.004
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

14:05.038 --> 14:06.439
Come on, come on, come on,
here you go.

14:06.472 --> 14:08.107
I'm not done with it!

14:08.140 --> 14:10.044
Right, left.

14:10.077 --> 14:11.378
You got this.
You got this.

14:11.410 --> 14:14.346
Look at you.
You tiny dancer, you.

14:14.379 --> 14:15.582
-Okay.
-Leave me here.

14:15.616 --> 14:17.150
I can't leave you.

14:17.183 --> 14:18.819
Tomorrow's
gonna be awful.

14:18.852 --> 14:20.221
What!
Tomorrow's gonna be awesome.

14:20.254 --> 14:21.956
Let's get you some coffee.

14:23.591 --> 14:25.359
All right, buddy.
Come on, come on.

14:25.391 --> 14:30.231
Almost, yep. Close. There.
Okay, nice, nice.

14:33.535 --> 14:35.035
Meteor shower
is impressing thousands

14:35.068 --> 14:36.972
all across
Southern California.

14:37.005 --> 14:39.173
Authorities have reported
meteor impacts

14:39.206 --> 14:40.976
in the Angeles National Forest

14:41.008 --> 14:43.277
as well as
Joshua Tree National Park.

14:43.310 --> 14:45.011
In other news,
there are a growing number

14:45.044 --> 14:47.049
of disappearances
in the high desert area

14:47.082 --> 14:50.085
which local sheriff's
departments attribute...

15:03.265 --> 15:05.867
So let me
get this straight.

15:08.336 --> 15:10.638
You want to go
digging up space rocks

15:10.671 --> 15:12.907
in the middle
of the goddamn night?

15:12.940 --> 15:14.141
Dude, they're worth a fortune!

15:14.175 --> 15:16.878
So is a good night's sleep.

15:16.911 --> 15:19.213
Jonas, just promise me
this is not gonna turn out

15:19.247 --> 15:21.584
like the jackrabbit scheme;
remember that?

15:21.617 --> 15:24.320
It would've worked
if somebody hadn't gotten angry.

15:24.353 --> 15:27.056
Besides, man, I told you,
rabbits spook easy.

15:27.089 --> 15:30.526
Candice told me these things
are worth a ton of money.

15:30.559 --> 15:33.496
Candice told you.
Great, yeah.

15:33.528 --> 15:35.431
We're gonna find
one of these things,

15:35.464 --> 15:37.032
we're gonna sell it,

15:37.065 --> 15:39.402
and we're gonna split
the profit 60-40.

15:39.435 --> 15:43.539
Wait, and why
would you get 60%?

15:43.571 --> 15:45.541
Because it was my idea.

15:45.574 --> 15:47.075
Yeah, and it's
a half-assed idea,

15:47.108 --> 15:48.610
so you should get half.

15:48.643 --> 15:50.012
Fifty-fifty.

15:50.046 --> 15:52.316
You know what? Fine.
Fifty-fifty.

15:52.349 --> 15:54.349
But that's only because
I'm your friend.

15:54.382 --> 15:56.652
And, we're using my truck.

15:56.685 --> 15:58.220
I thought this was our truck.

15:58.254 --> 16:00.089
I mean, it's got
my name on it too.

16:00.122 --> 16:03.226
No, no, no, that's only
'cause I'm your friend.

16:18.441 --> 16:20.376
Dude, where the hell
are we, anyways?

16:20.409 --> 16:22.112
Here, hand me the map.

16:24.047 --> 16:28.018
Thanks. Nice.

16:28.051 --> 16:30.488
-Got it. Got it.
-Jesus.

16:32.321 --> 16:33.356
God damn it.

16:33.389 --> 16:34.490
Sorry.

16:34.523 --> 16:35.659
So violent.

16:42.567 --> 16:43.701
No, man. Look.

16:43.734 --> 16:45.302
Dude, what is that?

16:45.335 --> 16:46.270
All right, you know what?

16:46.303 --> 16:47.370
If we go...

16:47.403 --> 16:49.406
if we go
about 20 more miles...

16:49.439 --> 16:50.506
Jonas, look out!

16:50.539 --> 16:51.541
Jesus Christ!

16:55.546 --> 16:59.651
Ohhhhh, man.

16:59.683 --> 17:01.685
I told you to keep
your eyes on the road.

17:08.759 --> 17:09.760
Man.

17:09.794 --> 17:12.364
Holy goddamn.

17:14.598 --> 17:16.634
Jesus!

17:16.665 --> 17:18.470
Is that an electrical tower?

17:18.502 --> 17:20.405
Sure looks like it.

17:20.439 --> 17:22.174
How the hell did that come down?

17:24.674 --> 17:28.512
Hey, man, whatever it was, we're
not getting around that mess.

17:28.546 --> 17:30.482
Come on, let's go.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.084
Jonas.

17:33.751 --> 17:35.453
Jonas, let's go.

17:36.754 --> 17:38.322
Something must have hit it.

17:38.356 --> 17:41.027
Yeah, what,
one of your meteorites?

17:43.628 --> 17:46.064
-No.
-Yeah.

17:46.097 --> 17:48.568
Yeah.
Grab the flashlights.

17:49.701 --> 17:51.203
Sure.

17:51.235 --> 17:53.271
Goddamn,
I hate you sometimes.

17:53.305 --> 17:55.141
Yeah, well, you can
hate me after we're rich.

17:55.174 --> 17:56.642
Dude, what are we even
looking for out here?

17:56.674 --> 17:58.411
Dude, I already
told you, a space rock!

17:58.443 --> 17:59.578
A space rock, okay.

17:59.610 --> 18:00.813
And how does a space rock

18:00.847 --> 18:02.347
look different
from a regular rock?

18:02.380 --> 18:03.548
I don't know,
probably like

18:03.581 --> 18:06.051
it came from space
or something.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.554
This is crazy. I'm crazy.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.320
-I can't believe I'm doing this.
-Me neither.

18:09.354 --> 18:11.158
You're not exactly
the adventurous type.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.458
-Hey, neither are you.
-Hey!

18:12.491 --> 18:13.560
And this ain't an adventure.

18:13.592 --> 18:15.193
It's a wild goose chase.

18:18.464 --> 18:20.266
I mean, shit, Jonas,
there ain't nothing out here

18:20.300 --> 18:21.568
but dirt and more dirt.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.302
Lars, you saw
that tower back there.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.771
There's something out here.
Keep looking.

18:24.803 --> 18:26.540
Dude, it probably fell
from a quake or something.

18:26.572 --> 18:28.108
I mean, come on, man.

18:28.140 --> 18:29.708
I do not want to spend
all night out here.

18:29.742 --> 18:32.178
It's cold, dark,
and I feel ridiculous.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.815
-Come on.
-Ridiculous? Ridiculous?

18:34.848 --> 18:38.117
You know when I feel ridiculous is when
I'm planting shrubs and shit all day.

18:38.150 --> 18:39.285
You don't see me complaining.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.386
I don't see you complaining?

18:40.419 --> 18:41.621
That's all you do!

18:41.655 --> 18:43.290
Come on, man, take a chance!

18:43.322 --> 18:44.490
I mean, think about it.

18:44.523 --> 18:45.858
We could get rid
of the yard work thing.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.294
How bad would that be?

18:47.327 --> 18:48.596
I like the yard work thing,
Jonas.

18:48.628 --> 18:49.628
Man.

18:49.662 --> 18:50.630
It's simple, honest work

18:50.663 --> 18:51.732
that happens during the day.

18:51.764 --> 18:53.599
And you know what it doesn't do?

18:53.633 --> 18:55.403
It doesn't leave me wandering
through the goddamn desert

18:55.436 --> 18:58.339
in the middle of the night
looking for space rocks!

18:58.371 --> 18:59.772
You know what? Screw it.

18:59.806 --> 19:00.842
-Lars.
-I'm out of here.

19:00.875 --> 19:02.109
I'm going back to the truck.

19:02.143 --> 19:03.410
Lars, come on, man.

19:03.443 --> 19:04.878
Good luck chasing your miracles.

19:04.912 --> 19:06.681
Lars!

19:06.714 --> 19:07.815
God damn it.

19:07.848 --> 19:09.616
The truck's back that way.

19:11.918 --> 19:12.820
Shit.

19:14.155 --> 19:15.123
Lars!

19:21.395 --> 19:23.498
Holy crap!

19:26.734 --> 19:29.838
This is exactly how I wanted
to spend my friday night.

19:29.870 --> 19:31.339
Dude, give me a hand.

19:31.371 --> 19:33.174
It smells
like rotten eggs down here.

19:37.645 --> 19:40.281
What are you looking at?

19:40.313 --> 19:43.384
-That's it. That's a space rock.
-I'll be damned.

19:45.754 --> 19:49.424
God, this thing's got...
Thing's got some heft.

19:49.456 --> 19:50.725
It's still warm.

19:50.758 --> 19:52.593
-Yeah.
-I wonder what it's made out of.

19:52.627 --> 19:54.562
Probably something valuable.

19:54.596 --> 19:56.298
So much for the wild
goose chase?

19:56.331 --> 19:57.799
Shut up.

19:57.831 --> 19:59.467
All right, let's get this thing
back to the truck.

19:59.501 --> 20:01.637
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:13.248 --> 20:15.183
Come on, man, let's go!

20:19.655 --> 20:22.892
Come on, man,
we're almost there!

20:22.925 --> 20:24.493
I wonder if they pay
by the ounce.

20:24.525 --> 20:25.661
Here.

20:28.664 --> 20:30.934
Hey, you mind if we tell Candice
I found the rock?

20:30.966 --> 20:31.935
I don't care.

20:31.967 --> 20:34.170
Go impress your lady friend.

21:12.375 --> 21:14.311
Dang it.

21:41.072 --> 21:42.573
My God.

21:44.441 --> 21:45.509
My God.

21:58.555 --> 21:59.824
Hello.

21:59.856 --> 22:02.493
This is, Jonas from...

22:02.526 --> 22:03.995
The guy from the bar.

22:04.027 --> 22:05.931
From friday,
you know, every friday.

22:05.963 --> 22:08.299
Right, hey.

22:08.333 --> 22:10.468
You know, when I gave you
my number,

22:10.500 --> 22:15.540
I didn't expect you to call me
at 7:30 on a saturday morning.

22:15.574 --> 22:16.675
Are you drunk?

22:16.708 --> 22:18.611
No, no, no, why?

22:18.643 --> 22:21.447
Why... why... why would I
be drunk? I mean, I just...

22:21.479 --> 22:23.815
No, I just... I...

22:23.847 --> 22:26.351
You know, I called
to just, you know...

22:26.384 --> 22:28.320
Yeah?

22:28.354 --> 22:30.555
-Remember those space rocks?
-What?

22:30.587 --> 22:31.691
We found a meteorite,
a space rock.

22:31.723 --> 22:32.791
We found it all by ourselves.

22:32.825 --> 22:33.824
I mean myself.
I found it.

22:33.857 --> 22:35.894
Well...

22:37.962 --> 22:40.732
-Good.
-Yeah I...

22:40.766 --> 22:42.067
I... I... I,
wanted to know

22:42.101 --> 22:43.636
if maybe we could stop by
and, you know,

22:43.669 --> 22:45.371
you could take a look at it
and, you know,

22:45.403 --> 22:48.840
just kind of give... give us
your expert opinion on it.

22:50.709 --> 22:51.710
Now?

22:51.744 --> 22:53.614
Sure?

22:55.814 --> 22:58.651
Hell, I'm already awake, so...

22:58.683 --> 23:00.086
meteors!

23:00.120 --> 23:01.587
It's one way to start the day.

23:05.392 --> 23:07.727
-Are you still there?
-Yeah, yeah, still here.

23:07.759 --> 23:10.596
Still here, always here for you.

23:10.630 --> 23:16.003
All right,
let me give you my address.

23:23.143 --> 23:25.578
God.

23:32.852 --> 23:35.855
Well, what crawled up your butt
and made you so happy this morning?

23:35.888 --> 23:37.657
I just made a phone call.

23:37.691 --> 23:38.892
About the rock?

23:38.924 --> 23:40.160
Yeah, you could say that.

23:41.961 --> 23:43.431
Your phone got GPS?

23:43.463 --> 23:45.398
Can I use this?
I'm gonna use this.

23:45.432 --> 23:47.167
Yes, go for it.

23:47.201 --> 23:48.468
So where are we headed?

23:48.500 --> 23:50.471
Candice's.

23:50.503 --> 23:52.706
No shit.
How'd that happen?

23:52.740 --> 23:54.075
Just lucky, I guess.

23:54.107 --> 23:55.041
How do I look?

23:56.143 --> 23:57.644
-Good.
-Yeah?

23:57.677 --> 23:59.880
Yeah, yeah, you look lively.

24:02.081 --> 24:03.083
-All right.
-Sure.

24:03.116 --> 24:04.918
I can do lively.
Yeah.

24:19.799 --> 24:21.837
Hey, buddy,
you smell that?

24:21.869 --> 24:25.839
Something in the...
Something in the air?

24:25.873 --> 24:27.509
Yeah, actually.

24:27.541 --> 24:28.711
What is that?

24:31.178 --> 24:34.015
That's the smell of change,
my friend.

24:36.651 --> 24:38.053
Lars, I wasn't being serious.

24:38.086 --> 24:39.621
You can't actually smell change.

24:39.654 --> 24:42.490
Jesus.

24:42.522 --> 24:45.226
Come on, man, you look like a dog
with your head in the wind right now.

24:45.260 --> 24:46.929
-Stay with me here.
-Shut up for a second, okay?

24:48.629 --> 24:49.864
Smells like rotten eggs.

24:49.897 --> 24:52.202
God.

24:55.538 --> 24:57.039
-Shit.
-What?

24:57.071 --> 24:58.742
I don't want to smell shit.
Roll up your window.

25:15.090 --> 25:16.958
What the...

25:19.662 --> 25:21.798
-What the hell is that thing?
-I don't know.

25:21.830 --> 25:25.033
Looks like a goddamn
mutant pelican.

25:25.067 --> 25:26.202
Pelican?

25:26.234 --> 25:28.704
Like a bird or something.

25:28.737 --> 25:30.706
Yeah, well, that's
one angry goddamn bird.

25:33.608 --> 25:36.546
Whoaaaaaa.

25:36.580 --> 25:37.547
God damn it.

25:38.714 --> 25:40.082
Jesus Christ!

25:41.783 --> 25:43.220
My god!

25:51.027 --> 25:52.997
Get it off the truck.
Get it off!

26:02.738 --> 26:03.939
Get it off.

26:03.973 --> 26:05.242
Shake it loose.
Come on.

26:05.274 --> 26:07.078
-My arm!
-My god, are you okay?

26:09.580 --> 26:12.049
Come on, get off.

26:12.081 --> 26:13.316
I don't think it likes
us very much.

26:13.349 --> 26:14.851
Yeah?

26:16.352 --> 26:19.189
Well, let's see how it likes
sudden stops.

26:26.731 --> 26:27.998
My baby.

26:28.031 --> 26:29.701
He tore up my baby.

26:31.868 --> 26:33.938
Shit, he's still going.
He's still going.

26:33.972 --> 26:35.573
Should I turn around?

26:35.606 --> 26:37.309
No, screw that.

26:37.341 --> 26:38.208
Drive.

26:52.023 --> 26:53.158
I think we got it, man!

26:53.190 --> 26:54.959
I think we got it!
I think we...

26:57.195 --> 27:00.264
We got it!

27:00.298 --> 27:03.068
-My baby. My baby.
-My God. My God.

27:03.100 --> 27:04.670
What did he do to you?

27:07.672 --> 27:10.375
My truck was fine
before today, Jonas.

27:10.409 --> 27:12.010
Sorry.

27:25.389 --> 27:27.860
Hold your horses.
I'm coming.

27:32.430 --> 27:33.665
Val?

27:33.698 --> 27:35.968
Mornin', roomie.

27:39.971 --> 27:42.941
Christ, Val, do you have
any idea what time it is?

27:42.975 --> 27:44.945
It's saturday morning.
Does it matter?

27:44.977 --> 27:46.845
I lost my keys again.

27:46.879 --> 27:49.247
But I had another adventure
last night.

27:49.281 --> 27:51.685
What was his name?

27:51.718 --> 27:53.886
Rodriguez.

27:54.888 --> 27:56.422
Val, I work in a bar

27:56.455 --> 27:58.058
and I don't drink
as much as you do.

27:58.091 --> 28:00.159
It is not my fault
that you don't know

28:00.191 --> 28:02.261
how to relax or get
shit-faced for free.

28:02.295 --> 28:04.430
Well, sorry I'm never
in the mood to be felt up

28:04.464 --> 28:07.833
by some douche bag
just to get some cheap drinks.

28:07.866 --> 28:09.235
Don't knock it until you try it.

28:10.804 --> 28:12.738
Speaking of knocking.

28:12.772 --> 28:14.207
Excuse me, I have a date.

28:14.239 --> 28:16.142
On saturday morning?

28:16.176 --> 28:18.278
God, you're such a prude!

28:20.013 --> 28:21.782
Well, good morning, Cand-ass.

28:21.814 --> 28:22.950
Hi, Vince.

28:22.982 --> 28:25.017
Is Valerie here?

28:25.051 --> 28:27.121
She just got in.

28:35.296 --> 28:36.929
That's your date?

28:36.962 --> 28:38.197
Shut up.

28:38.230 --> 28:40.733
Valerie, my little concubine.

28:40.766 --> 28:42.303
Hi, Vincey.

28:42.335 --> 28:45.238
Now, Valerie, don't start
playing hard to get.

28:45.271 --> 28:46.840
Vince, once a month.

28:46.872 --> 28:48.910
That's as easy
as it gets for you.

28:48.942 --> 28:50.443
Well, that's why
I'm here, actually.

28:50.477 --> 28:53.180
I wanted to renegotiate
your lease.

28:53.213 --> 28:55.950
I was thinking,
twice a month.

28:55.982 --> 28:58.418
Are you sure you could
even last that long?

28:58.451 --> 29:01.488
Vince, can you please go perv up
our apartment some other time?

29:01.521 --> 29:03.290
I'm waiting for a friend
to arrive.

29:03.324 --> 29:04.325
She's got a date.

29:04.357 --> 29:07.195
On a saturday morning?

29:07.229 --> 29:09.229
God, you're a prude, ain't ya?

29:09.263 --> 29:11.232
Val, you really got
to get this one laid.

29:11.265 --> 29:13.134
That's what I've been saying.

29:23.077 --> 29:26.749
All right, I'm going.

29:26.781 --> 29:28.348
But think about my offer, Val.

29:28.382 --> 29:31.787
I'll even throw in
free utilities.

29:36.557 --> 29:39.827
And if you ever want
to make alternate payments,

29:39.861 --> 29:42.464
I'm always open
to suggestions.

29:42.497 --> 29:45.133
I suggest you leave.

29:55.110 --> 29:58.247
If you want
to "renegotiate your lease."

29:58.279 --> 30:01.084
You are unbelievable.

30:01.116 --> 30:02.884
I'm extraordinary.

30:02.918 --> 30:04.320
That's one word for it.

30:04.353 --> 30:06.389
I really need a shower.

30:06.422 --> 30:08.556
I can't believe you're still
sleeping with our landlord.

30:08.589 --> 30:11.560
Well, I can't believe that
you're still paying for rent.

30:11.594 --> 30:13.296
Barely.

30:15.964 --> 30:17.866
Christ!

30:17.900 --> 30:20.136
-What else do you want?
-Hey, how's it going?

30:20.169 --> 30:22.138
Hey, we got attacked
by a bird on the way over.

30:22.171 --> 30:23.972
It was a really big one.

30:24.006 --> 30:25.942
I think it was some kind
of a mutant...

30:25.974 --> 30:28.444
Some kind of a mutant bird,
really freaked us out.

30:28.478 --> 30:30.580
All right, look, this thing's
kind of heavy, okay?

30:30.613 --> 30:32.215
This pansy's afraid
of elevators.

30:32.248 --> 30:34.017
You live on the tenth floor.

30:34.049 --> 30:35.351
Can we come in, please?

30:35.385 --> 30:38.122
Yeah.

30:38.154 --> 30:41.259
-Okay, thanks.
-Hi.

30:54.471 --> 30:57.141
-Don't move.
-All right.

30:57.174 --> 30:59.276
You need to stop moving
and dancing in your seat.

30:59.308 --> 31:00.578
Okay, okay.

31:00.610 --> 31:03.079
Now you're just wriggling.
Stop it.

31:05.281 --> 31:07.885
You said a bird attacked you?

31:07.917 --> 31:09.454
Yeah, I mean,
that's what they look like.

31:09.486 --> 31:11.222
Tell you what, though:
they're way less friendlier

31:11.254 --> 31:13.924
than they are
on the Discover Channel.

31:13.956 --> 31:15.392
We totally badassed it, though.

31:15.425 --> 31:17.126
KO'd that son of a bitch.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.030
Knocked him right on his ass.
Boom.

31:20.631 --> 31:22.267
And how did you slay

31:22.300 --> 31:25.436
this mighty beast,
O brave knight?

31:25.470 --> 31:27.203
I ain't no knight.

31:27.237 --> 31:29.140
But, you know, at one point,
he's right on top of us,

31:29.173 --> 31:30.274
and then, bam,
I hit the brakes.

31:30.307 --> 31:32.243
Sucker must've flew 50 feet.

31:32.277 --> 31:34.412
Saved both our asses.

31:34.444 --> 31:35.946
What? I did!

31:35.980 --> 31:37.482
I did. Go ahead, ask Lars.

31:37.514 --> 31:39.917
-Please don't.
-Sounds dangerous.

31:39.951 --> 31:42.521
You getting into the monster
slaying business now?

31:44.953 --> 31:46.023
I'm kidding.

31:49.092 --> 31:50.628
I'm glad you're okay.

31:53.165 --> 31:54.933
You know, you're cute
when you blush.

31:54.965 --> 32:00.238
And last night, we...
I mean Jonas

32:00.272 --> 32:02.374
found this.

32:02.406 --> 32:04.275
What is that?

32:04.309 --> 32:07.445
Only the biggest damn payday
you've ever seen.

32:13.051 --> 32:14.252
It's warm.

32:14.284 --> 32:15.620
Yeah, it's been sitting

32:15.654 --> 32:17.956
in the back of my truck
all morning.

32:17.989 --> 32:19.458
I've never seen
anything like it.

32:19.491 --> 32:21.627
Yeah, I don't think anyone has.

32:21.659 --> 32:24.095
Thing fell out of the sky
last night.

32:24.128 --> 32:26.098
I fished it out of the desert.

32:26.130 --> 32:27.499
Dude, what?

32:27.532 --> 32:29.234
It's bad enough you have us
bring it to her.

32:29.268 --> 32:32.038
Now you're gonna tell her
where to find more?

32:32.070 --> 32:34.340
She ain't interested
in the money.

32:36.008 --> 32:38.411
Besides, she thinks I'm cute,
man, come on.

32:38.444 --> 32:40.446
I want 20%.

32:40.479 --> 32:41.680
God damn it.

32:41.714 --> 32:43.449
Jonas, you're about as dumb

32:43.483 --> 32:45.417
as a bowling ball
when it comes to women.

32:47.286 --> 32:48.486
What for?

32:48.520 --> 32:49.990
Call it a finder's fee.

32:50.023 --> 32:52.191
Okay. But you didn't find it.

32:52.224 --> 32:53.592
And you wouldn't have
if I hadn't

32:53.626 --> 32:56.096
have told Jonas
it was worth looking for.

32:56.129 --> 32:58.964
Really?

32:58.998 --> 33:01.167
All right, fine, 20%...

33:01.200 --> 33:02.201
Out of his share.

33:04.204 --> 33:05.539
Wait, wait, wait.

33:05.571 --> 33:06.639
Wait a minute. That ain't fair.

33:06.673 --> 33:07.741
That ain't fair, really?

33:07.773 --> 33:09.008
What's the count at now?

33:09.042 --> 33:10.343
How much money do you owe me?

33:12.244 --> 33:14.414
-Twenty percent.
-Deal.

33:14.446 --> 33:16.282
Let me call my cousin.
She works at the museum.

33:19.052 --> 33:20.721
What about that damn bird?

33:20.754 --> 33:22.121
What about it?

33:22.155 --> 33:23.991
It's dead. You killed it.

33:24.023 --> 33:25.993
Exactly!
You owe me your life for that.

33:26.025 --> 33:29.095
And don't think that's worth
any less than what I owe you.

33:31.098 --> 33:32.299
All right, fine.

33:32.331 --> 33:34.401
Ten percent
from each of our shares.

33:34.435 --> 33:36.168
Does that work?

33:36.202 --> 33:37.572
Deal.

33:37.604 --> 33:39.138
But I don't want to hear
any more about

33:39.171 --> 33:42.075
that "lazy son of a bitch Jonas"
ever again.

33:42.109 --> 33:43.410
All right, all right, all right.

33:43.444 --> 33:45.380
I admit it.
You did good here.

33:45.412 --> 33:47.381
And you even managed
to call her.

33:47.415 --> 33:50.151
Guess you just needed a push
in the right direction.

33:50.184 --> 33:51.319
Thank you.

33:51.351 --> 33:53.521
Doesn't make you less lazy.

33:55.590 --> 33:57.392
Just more respectable.

33:57.425 --> 33:59.327
I like respectable.

34:00.494 --> 34:02.197
Guys.

34:02.229 --> 34:03.630
Something's wrong.

34:06.566 --> 34:08.335
My God.

34:19.313 --> 34:21.583
Maybe we shouldn't be
so close to these windows.

34:25.853 --> 34:27.322
Dude, dude, dude, dude,
I'm getting the feeling

34:27.353 --> 34:28.289
this one's staring at me.

34:28.322 --> 34:29.556
Is that weird?

34:44.405 --> 34:46.074
Can, I'm taking
your shorts again.

34:46.109 --> 34:47.641
Valerie, shut up for once.

34:47.675 --> 34:49.445
You're taking them again?

35:07.864 --> 35:09.265
We got to distract it.

35:09.297 --> 35:10.399
How?

35:13.569 --> 35:15.739
Lars. Lars.

35:18.207 --> 35:19.342
Your lighter.

35:22.879 --> 35:24.247
Toss me your lighter.

35:24.279 --> 35:25.147
What are you doing?

35:31.154 --> 35:32.155
Trust me.

35:33.423 --> 35:35.358
Hey, hey there,
Big Bird.

35:37.926 --> 35:39.429
Take it easy now.

35:39.463 --> 35:41.132
No need to go
all Cookie Monster on us.

35:45.334 --> 35:46.403
Run.

35:48.437 --> 35:49.307
Run!

35:55.278 --> 35:56.479
Got him.

35:56.512 --> 35:58.415
Come on!
Let's get out of here!

35:59.816 --> 36:01.253
Did you see that shit?

36:01.285 --> 36:02.585
I did that.
I did that.

36:02.619 --> 36:03.921
My truck's in the alley.
Let's go!

36:03.954 --> 36:06.791
-The elevators!
-God, not the elevator.

36:08.258 --> 36:09.392
You know it's not
gonna get here

36:09.425 --> 36:11.262
any faster
if you keep doing that.

36:11.296 --> 36:12.429
Would you stop that?

36:12.461 --> 36:13.530
We're not taking the stairs.

36:13.563 --> 36:15.565
We're all sticking together.

36:17.634 --> 36:18.735
This elevator sucks.

36:18.769 --> 36:20.538
Blame the landlord.

36:20.571 --> 36:22.773
What the hell
is all this noise?

36:22.806 --> 36:24.676
Who the hell are you?

36:24.709 --> 36:26.578
Who am I?

36:26.611 --> 36:29.948
I'm the building manager.
That's who I am, sonny Jim.

36:29.980 --> 36:31.950
Who the hell are you,
Huckleberry Finn?

36:31.982 --> 36:35.652
We... we were just
on our way out, sir.

36:35.686 --> 36:36.922
What's that smell?

36:38.723 --> 36:40.425
You've been smoking
in that apartment again.

36:40.457 --> 36:42.493
-Haven't you?
-With the...

36:42.526 --> 36:44.395
I told you before,
it's grounds for eviction.

36:44.428 --> 36:45.697
Give me five minutes.

36:45.730 --> 36:47.398
I'll do the paperwork right now.

36:47.432 --> 36:48.902
Turn! Turn!

36:54.504 --> 36:55.907
Go, go, go!

36:55.939 --> 36:57.375
God. God.

37:10.822 --> 37:12.791
So... so that guy was...

37:12.824 --> 37:14.326
An asshole.

37:14.360 --> 37:15.628
And you are?

37:15.661 --> 37:18.264
-Valerie, my roommate.
-Okay, okay.

37:18.297 --> 37:20.465
This is exactly how I wanted
to spend my weekend.

37:20.498 --> 37:22.634
-Right.
-You're telling me.

37:22.668 --> 37:24.637
You gonna be okay?

37:24.670 --> 37:26.240
Shit.

37:27.373 --> 37:29.443
How am I gonna pay my rent now?

37:31.309 --> 37:32.879
What?

37:35.948 --> 37:38.016
No! No!

37:38.050 --> 37:39.787
Out the back!
Out the back!

37:46.459 --> 37:48.828
-There it is!
-I missed it.

37:52.064 --> 37:53.699
My truck!

37:53.731 --> 37:55.669
-Our truck!
-We'll take my car.

37:55.702 --> 37:56.803
Come on! Let's go!

37:56.836 --> 37:58.772
-Bitch.
-Come on, dude.

37:58.805 --> 38:00.741
-Come on!
-Bastard!

38:04.343 --> 38:06.445
You guys, my car is
on the other side of the garage.

38:06.479 --> 38:07.848
I'm gonna kill them.

38:07.881 --> 38:09.415
I'm gonna kill
all those freaking birds.

38:09.448 --> 38:10.883
They're not birds.
They're lizards.

38:10.917 --> 38:12.986
Val, hurry up!

38:13.019 --> 38:14.921
-Lizards, like toads?
-I'm gonna kill them.

38:14.953 --> 38:16.357
I'm gonna kill
all those freaking lizards.

38:16.389 --> 38:17.823
Toads aren't lizards.

38:17.856 --> 38:19.059
Didn't you guys ever
learn that in school?

38:19.091 --> 38:20.860
Hey, I went to school.

38:20.894 --> 38:22.462
Mostly.

38:22.496 --> 38:24.330
Lizards,
like dinosaurs.

38:24.363 --> 38:25.899
I'm gonna kill
all these freakin' dinosaurs.

38:25.933 --> 38:27.435
Dinosaurs died out,
like, a million years ago.

38:27.467 --> 38:28.669
That's impossible.

38:28.702 --> 38:30.038
I used
to love them as a kid.

38:30.070 --> 38:31.437
They looked so pretty
in the drawings.

38:31.470 --> 38:32.806
What kind
of dinosaurs are these?

38:32.840 --> 38:34.342
I can't be sure
for certain,

38:34.375 --> 38:35.976
but they kind of look
like pterodactyls.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.344
Terror-dactyls.

38:37.378 --> 38:38.946
Ptero-dactyl.

38:38.978 --> 38:40.547
Fitting name, at least.

38:40.581 --> 38:42.383
Well, whatever they are,
they're everywhere.

38:42.416 --> 38:44.486
-We need to get somewhere safe.
-Can't we just kill 'em?

38:44.519 --> 38:45.887
What, with rubbing alcohol
and matches?

38:45.920 --> 38:48.021
Because that worked
so well last time.

38:48.054 --> 38:50.024
Hey, saved your ass, didn't it?

38:53.928 --> 38:55.329
-I killed one.
-With your brakes.

38:55.362 --> 38:56.531
I could do it again.

38:56.563 --> 38:58.032
Look, guys, can we hide
back at the bar?

38:58.066 --> 38:59.599
I mean, a drink's
always made me feel better.

38:59.632 --> 39:01.102
-What?
-No.

39:01.135 --> 39:02.903
We need to go somewhere
where we can defend ourselves,

39:02.936 --> 39:06.373
somewhere that they can't
easily get into.

39:06.407 --> 39:07.943
You got something in mind?

39:07.975 --> 39:11.513
Yeah, but you're not
gonna like it.

39:16.952 --> 39:19.754
Great, it's Mr. Barbecue
again, wonderful.

39:19.787 --> 39:22.022
Wherever it is, I'm gonna
like it a lot more than here.

39:22.056 --> 39:23.091
Drive.

39:49.184 --> 39:50.853
Christ,
it's a madhouse out here!

39:50.886 --> 39:53.722
My God, there are monsters
all over Hollywood!

39:53.755 --> 39:55.424
It's not much different
than usual, then.

39:55.458 --> 39:57.160
If I said
that we've got company,

39:57.192 --> 39:59.095
would that be too cliché?

40:01.197 --> 40:03.032
Candice, you're probably
a good driver and all,

40:03.065 --> 40:06.603
but now would be a good time
to exceed posted speed limits.

40:06.636 --> 40:07.871
Hold on to something!

40:15.076 --> 40:17.013
-The freeway?
-Are you insane?

40:17.045 --> 40:18.480
It's the fastest way.

40:18.513 --> 40:20.048
Yeah, yeah, fastest way
to sudden death.

40:20.081 --> 40:22.787
-We have to get downtown.
-Why are we taking the freeway?

40:22.820 --> 40:24.087
Why would anyone
take the freeway?

40:24.119 --> 40:25.823
Shut up and let me drive!

40:40.903 --> 40:42.472
It's still behind us.

40:42.506 --> 40:43.975
Jesus, just the one?

40:48.110 --> 40:50.480
-Not anymore.
-Great, great.

40:50.514 --> 40:52.115
We get stuck here
and we're dead.

41:01.657 --> 41:04.094
I am not dying on my day off!

41:15.072 --> 41:16.607
Damn!

41:16.640 --> 41:17.674
My God.

41:20.078 --> 41:22.080
My God. My God.

41:24.214 --> 41:25.883
Today was supposed
to be a spa day.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.785
-What?
-Up here. Up here.

41:27.819 --> 41:29.587
-Take the next exit.
-Jonas, shut up.

41:29.620 --> 41:31.489
All right, Candice,
you stay on this road.

41:31.522 --> 41:33.057
Do I get a say in any of this?

41:33.091 --> 41:34.227
No!

41:34.260 --> 41:35.727
But if you want
to start praying,

41:35.759 --> 41:37.062
now would be a good time.

41:51.676 --> 41:53.512
-Candice, do you mind?
-What are you doing?

41:53.546 --> 41:55.214
No!
Yes, do it! Do it!

42:03.822 --> 42:05.257
No, they're coming back!

42:05.290 --> 42:06.593
Everybody get down!

42:15.233 --> 42:16.768
They think we're one of them.

42:16.802 --> 42:17.937
What?

42:17.970 --> 42:19.038
They can't tell that it's dead.

42:19.070 --> 42:20.172
They think we're one of them.

42:21.875 --> 42:22.742
Camouflage.

42:24.877 --> 42:27.613
Well, if we're gonna
be attacked by monsters,

42:27.647 --> 42:29.849
I'm sure glad
they're dumb as shit.

42:29.882 --> 42:33.286
My God. My God.
My God.

43:12.059 --> 43:14.629
This is
your idea of safe?

43:14.661 --> 43:17.096
Yeah, do people still get mugged
during times of crisis?

43:17.129 --> 43:19.132
No.

43:19.166 --> 43:20.667
Wait, wait. Do they?

43:20.700 --> 43:22.269
Come on.

43:22.302 --> 43:23.870
What?

43:28.041 --> 43:29.977
-Whose place is this?
-I don't know, dude.

43:30.009 --> 43:31.278
Let's just say
I've been handed this address

43:31.311 --> 43:33.080
enough to know it by heart,

43:33.114 --> 43:34.816
even if I didn't want to.

43:34.849 --> 43:36.184
This isn't a drug dealer's
place, right?

43:36.217 --> 43:37.885
No, worse.

43:39.320 --> 43:41.255
-Your boyfriend's?
-I don't have one.

43:41.288 --> 43:42.890
-And I wouldn't bring...
-What?

43:44.190 --> 43:45.994
The sexy little spitfire
from the bar

43:46.028 --> 43:48.262
come to see old Sampson,
did ya?

43:48.295 --> 43:50.064
Glad to see ya came
to your senses.

43:50.098 --> 43:52.267
And you brought company.

43:55.402 --> 43:59.173
Well, haven't played
for that team in quite a while.

43:59.207 --> 44:00.708
Well.

44:00.740 --> 44:02.845
More, the merrier,
I always say.

44:05.080 --> 44:07.649
What the fuck is that?

44:07.681 --> 44:10.118
So...

44:10.151 --> 44:12.253
you slew a dragon.

44:12.287 --> 44:13.955
It's not a dragon.

44:13.988 --> 44:15.723
It's a pterodactyl.

44:15.756 --> 44:17.091
Ptero-what?

44:17.124 --> 44:19.194
Is that scientific for dragon?

44:20.762 --> 44:21.997
No.

44:24.232 --> 44:26.035
The great hunter.

44:26.068 --> 44:28.403
Yeah. Surprised?

44:29.403 --> 44:31.106
Are you sure it's dead?

44:31.138 --> 44:32.774
It's dead, all right.

44:32.807 --> 44:34.976
That's the second one
I've killed today.

44:38.345 --> 44:39.849
It is now.

44:41.883 --> 44:44.953
What are
ancient flying reptiles

44:44.986 --> 44:47.824
doing in Los Angeles
of all places?

44:51.326 --> 44:55.165
I used to do this guy
who did promotions for movies.

44:55.197 --> 44:57.701
Maybe it's something like that.
Yeah?

44:57.733 --> 45:03.840
They've been dead
for over 65 million years!

45:03.873 --> 45:05.708
And how do you know all this?

45:05.741 --> 45:06.875
I read.

45:06.909 --> 45:08.744
You know, books.

45:08.777 --> 45:10.746
She's kind of a nerd.

45:10.779 --> 45:12.982
Nerds.

45:13.014 --> 45:16.920
I used to shove nerds
into lockers in high school,

45:16.953 --> 45:20.791
trunks in cars, toilets,
walls, concrete floors.

45:20.823 --> 45:22.424
You name it.

45:22.458 --> 45:24.028
How am I a nerd?

45:24.060 --> 45:26.228
Come on, you take over the DVR

45:26.262 --> 45:28.265
with your
Discovery Channel crap.

45:28.298 --> 45:29.934
I-I kind of like nerds.

45:29.966 --> 45:31.801
And you boil leaves
in your coffee.

45:31.834 --> 45:34.271
-It's really weird.
-It's called a French press.

45:34.303 --> 45:36.173
Val, I taught you
how to use it last week.

45:36.205 --> 45:39.109
-It's still weird.
-I'm weird? What about you?

45:39.142 --> 45:41.478
You drink vodka
first thing every morning.

45:41.512 --> 45:42.879
Hey, I drink it
with orange juice.

45:42.912 --> 45:46.249
All right, enough! Look.

45:46.283 --> 45:47.785
What I want to know is,

45:47.818 --> 45:49.153
where the hell
is the damn military?

45:49.185 --> 45:51.287
-Yeah.
-You know, the tanks, the jets.

45:51.321 --> 45:53.190
All that crap our taxes pay for.

45:53.222 --> 45:55.992
That right there, I just might
have an answer for ya.

46:03.934 --> 46:05.804
That looks like military.

46:05.837 --> 46:07.438
Where the hell did you
dig that up?

46:07.471 --> 46:09.473
Well, let's just say
when I left the marines,

46:09.507 --> 46:12.277
I took a few souvenirs.

46:12.310 --> 46:15.880
Yeah, speaking of which,
how did you leave the marines?

46:15.913 --> 46:17.782
Well, you know
how alcohol explodes

46:17.815 --> 46:20.484
when it's stored
next to gasoline?

46:20.518 --> 46:22.954
No.

46:22.987 --> 46:25.357
Well, it does.
Quite a lot.

46:25.389 --> 46:28.460
Fortunately I've still got
some friends at Vandenberg.

46:28.493 --> 46:30.494
Marines never forget their own.

46:30.527 --> 46:32.062
Yeah, this guy's got
a lot of friends.

46:32.096 --> 46:33.831
Vandenberg Alpha,
this is Lone Hunter.

46:33.864 --> 46:35.167
Do you copy?

46:35.199 --> 46:36.468
You sure that thing still works?

46:38.469 --> 46:41.072
I repeat, Vandenberg Alpha,
this is Lone Hunter.

46:41.105 --> 46:42.408
Do you copy?

46:42.441 --> 46:43.842
It's probably not even
plugged in.

46:43.875 --> 46:45.977
Please.

46:46.010 --> 46:47.278
Waste of time.

46:47.311 --> 46:49.849
Vandenberg Alpha,
this is Lone Hunter.

46:49.881 --> 46:51.517
Do you copy?

46:51.550 --> 46:53.352
Anyone who can get this,
we are under attack.

46:53.385 --> 46:54.821
I repeat,
we are under attack.

46:54.854 --> 46:56.322
Monsters coming from the sky.

46:56.354 --> 46:58.423
Too many to count.
We're getting slaughtered!

46:58.457 --> 47:00.259
Wait. What's that?

47:01.459 --> 47:03.061
It's enormous!

47:03.095 --> 47:05.363
Send everything you've got!
Send...

47:05.396 --> 47:06.398
Shit.

47:11.936 --> 47:13.940
This is worse than I thought.

47:18.910 --> 47:21.179
Now I'm sober.

47:21.213 --> 47:23.283
No, no, no, no, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

47:23.315 --> 47:25.383
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
these things, these things,

47:25.416 --> 47:26.620
they were extinct before, right?

47:26.652 --> 47:27.919
-Yeah.
-Okay.

47:27.952 --> 47:29.455
Okay, so all we need to do

47:29.489 --> 47:31.057
is just, you know...
We'll figure out

47:31.090 --> 47:32.960
what killed them all off
last time,

47:32.993 --> 47:34.593
and, you know,
we'll do that again.

47:34.626 --> 47:36.196
-Dude.
-Yeah.

47:36.228 --> 47:38.564
Jonas, they were killed

47:38.598 --> 47:43.070
by a giant meteor
65 million years ago.

47:43.103 --> 47:44.637
Am I the only person
that knows this?

47:44.669 --> 47:46.540
-What I don't get is...
-I'm in science class.

47:46.573 --> 47:49.408
These pterodactyls, right,
they just happen to show up now?

47:49.442 --> 47:52.346
Maybe they've been
waiting all this time,

47:52.379 --> 47:54.115
just now hatching
from their eggs.

47:54.148 --> 47:55.549
I-I don't know.

47:55.582 --> 47:57.584
Yeah, well, how are
there so many eggs?

47:57.617 --> 48:00.152
I mean, is there some giant
dactyl just laying these things,

48:00.185 --> 48:02.054
like, on a big conveyor belt,
you know?

48:02.087 --> 48:05.958
But here's the other question.
How are they making eggs?

48:05.991 --> 48:08.394
Good question!
Nobody's yelling at him.

48:08.428 --> 48:11.398
Maybe you're just
all wrong.

48:13.566 --> 48:15.902
Maybe your ancient
massive meteor

48:15.935 --> 48:18.205
didn't kill 'em after all.

48:18.238 --> 48:19.974
Maybe it just flung 'em

48:20.006 --> 48:23.644
out into the cold, dark
infinite of space.

48:23.677 --> 48:26.513
And that's where they stayed.

48:26.546 --> 48:30.251
Circling around in the void,
biding their time.

48:30.284 --> 48:33.421
Getting more and more
pissed off.

48:35.223 --> 48:38.227
And now they've returned
with a vengeance.

48:40.427 --> 48:44.399
Maybe they just want
their home back.

48:44.433 --> 48:47.401
Our home.

48:47.434 --> 48:50.537
Maybe what they really want
is our freedom.

48:53.106 --> 48:56.979
Maybe they're just
itching for a fight!

49:02.584 --> 49:04.986
Yeah.

49:05.020 --> 49:08.524
Okay, okay, so,
assuming nobody here

49:08.556 --> 49:12.560
in this room has a giant
meteorite somewhere,

49:12.593 --> 49:16.165
what's plan B?

49:18.632 --> 49:20.303
Bullets.

49:29.045 --> 49:30.279
Yes!

49:30.312 --> 49:31.748
Dude, it looks like
Rambo in there.

49:31.780 --> 49:33.248
Guns.

49:33.281 --> 49:36.019
Freedom you can
hold in your hand.

49:36.052 --> 49:38.254
Is that a bomb?

49:38.286 --> 49:39.321
Yeah.

49:39.355 --> 49:41.358
Forgot I even had that thing.

49:41.391 --> 49:44.193
Parting gift
from an old girlfriend.

49:44.226 --> 49:46.362
Navy SEAL, sweet lass.

49:46.396 --> 49:48.664
Sweet ass too.

49:48.697 --> 49:50.566
Isn't that dangerous?

49:50.599 --> 49:52.001
Yeah.

49:52.034 --> 49:53.235
Never sleep with a woman

49:53.269 --> 49:55.005
who has a shiv in her bra.

49:55.037 --> 49:57.639
Hey.

49:57.673 --> 49:59.209
Those'll cost you, sweet cheeks.

49:59.242 --> 50:02.211
What was all that BS
about freedom just now?

50:02.244 --> 50:04.748
Well, freedom's free.
The guns ain't.

50:06.649 --> 50:09.386
Does it look like
we grabbed cash this morning?

50:09.419 --> 50:11.153
How are we supposed to pay you?

50:19.595 --> 50:21.497
-No way.
-Dude, dude.

50:21.530 --> 50:22.466
We divided this up enough.

50:22.499 --> 50:24.768
Dude, Lars,

50:24.800 --> 50:26.236
we need weapons.

50:26.270 --> 50:29.240
Yeah, and I need a new truck.

50:29.272 --> 50:30.341
Just don't...

50:30.374 --> 50:31.609
Truck, weapons.

50:31.642 --> 50:33.310
All right, fine.

50:36.680 --> 50:39.082
What do you want?

50:39.116 --> 50:40.685
I want the dragon.

50:40.717 --> 50:41.618
The pterodactyl?

50:41.651 --> 50:42.619
Yeah.

50:42.653 --> 50:44.121
You didn't kill it.

50:44.154 --> 50:46.556
So? And Columbus
didn't discover America.

50:46.589 --> 50:49.059
-Pfft!
-Dude, come on.

50:49.093 --> 50:51.462
Do we have a deal?

50:51.495 --> 50:53.164
-Seriously?
-Who cares?

50:53.197 --> 50:54.699
Jonas, yeah.

50:59.368 --> 51:02.039
Now, who's gonna help me
move this thing?

51:15.487 --> 51:17.255
You ever fire one of these?

51:17.288 --> 51:19.257
Only when I was a kid.

51:19.289 --> 51:20.558
You?

51:20.592 --> 51:23.095
No, Mom didn't
believe in guns.

51:23.128 --> 51:25.264
Said I could build
my own, though.

51:25.296 --> 51:27.699
-Did you?
-Yeah.

51:27.733 --> 51:30.601
Turns out dried cow shit
makes great gunpowder.

51:30.634 --> 51:32.770
Nice.

51:32.804 --> 51:36.575
That just might be a little
bit too dangerous for a...

51:36.608 --> 51:38.144
What? A woman?

51:45.782 --> 51:47.819
What other surprises you hiding?

51:47.852 --> 51:49.520
I wasn't always a bartender.

51:49.554 --> 51:51.491
Do tell.

51:51.524 --> 51:55.560
Maybe later when there aren't
man-eating reptile everywhere!

51:55.593 --> 51:59.232
Yeah? Yeah.

51:59.266 --> 52:01.234
I think I need to teach you
how to hold a gun.

52:03.301 --> 52:04.604
Or shoot one.

52:07.439 --> 52:10.408
-The hell no.
-Hey!

52:10.441 --> 52:12.411
Val, in this case,
I think it might be

52:12.444 --> 52:14.646
too dangerous for a woman
to have a gun.

52:14.680 --> 52:16.348
Fine.

52:16.381 --> 52:18.718
Then I'll just go find
my own weapon,

52:18.752 --> 52:21.822
like a sword

52:21.855 --> 52:23.455
or some scissors.

52:35.335 --> 52:36.203
Got it.

52:48.781 --> 52:51.951
All right, so this
is the tricky part.

52:51.985 --> 52:56.491
Once this mainspring is in,
sits right there,

52:56.524 --> 52:59.360
then this can slide
the rest of the way.

52:59.392 --> 53:01.360
See here?

53:01.393 --> 53:04.363
You're really good
with your hands.

53:04.397 --> 53:06.233
I'm sorry. Sorry...

53:14.473 --> 53:17.344
Scary day, right?

53:17.378 --> 53:18.912
Nah.

53:18.945 --> 53:20.214
They're just big animals.

53:20.247 --> 53:21.883
You know, just teeth and claws.

53:21.916 --> 53:24.219
Nothing really to be afraid of.

53:24.251 --> 53:27.255
They've killed
thousands of people.

53:27.288 --> 53:28.388
Right, exactly.

53:28.421 --> 53:31.458
So we need to even the score.

53:34.595 --> 53:37.366
Nothing fazes you, does it?

53:37.399 --> 53:39.434
Nope, nothing... nothing at all.

53:41.702 --> 53:43.304
Really.

53:43.337 --> 53:44.406
All right.

53:45.805 --> 53:47.409
Try sliding that in.

53:49.511 --> 53:50.413
Okay.

53:56.685 --> 53:57.652
Like this?

54:00.688 --> 54:02.658
Dang it. Sorry. Sorry.

54:02.690 --> 54:04.592
Brave monster slayer?

54:04.625 --> 54:07.896
Yeah, well, monsters are easy.

54:07.930 --> 54:12.034
And women are complicated?

54:12.067 --> 54:16.038
Look, I just... I suck at
sweeping women off their feet.

54:16.071 --> 54:18.774
We don't want to be
swept off of our feet.

54:18.806 --> 54:21.577
We want someone
who can keep us on our feet.

54:21.610 --> 54:24.847
Yeah, well, not every woman
is like you.

54:27.650 --> 54:29.819
Sounds like
it's getting personal.

54:31.421 --> 54:33.023
You know, I keep getting told

54:33.055 --> 54:37.427
that I just don't
get personal enough.

54:38.427 --> 54:39.895
Damn it.

54:39.929 --> 54:40.930
Here.

54:44.901 --> 54:47.671
You know, when I was
a little girl,

54:47.704 --> 54:50.939
I kept being afraid
of monsters in my closet.

54:50.972 --> 54:52.941
Couldn't get out of bed,

54:52.974 --> 54:55.279
go to the bathroom, nothing.

54:56.579 --> 54:57.914
You go running
into your parents' room?

54:57.947 --> 55:00.583
Nah, my dad
wasn't the kind to say,

55:00.615 --> 55:03.652
"Don't be scared.
They ain't real."

55:03.686 --> 55:07.356
Instead, he'd tell me
to toughen up.

55:07.389 --> 55:08.959
Show 'em how to be scared.

55:10.360 --> 55:11.496
That work?

55:13.061 --> 55:14.531
Eventually.

55:14.565 --> 55:17.768
One day, I just had
enough, you know?

55:17.801 --> 55:19.702
I just marched
right up to that closet,

55:19.735 --> 55:24.541
opened the door, and saw
there was nothing there.

55:24.574 --> 55:27.044
I was afraid of nothing.

55:28.911 --> 55:31.015
I just needed to face it
and figure it out.

55:32.582 --> 55:34.517
Your dad sounds pretty smart.

55:34.551 --> 55:35.652
Yeah.

55:37.920 --> 55:39.891
He also gave me
a nine-millimeter

55:39.923 --> 55:42.827
for my tenth birthday.

55:42.860 --> 55:45.062
So that definitely helped too.

55:46.398 --> 55:48.534
Dad was big on self-reliance.

55:52.836 --> 55:54.104
Could I try again?

56:07.017 --> 56:08.720
Ain't so scary now.

56:12.757 --> 56:13.926
That was good.

56:15.827 --> 56:16.696
You got it.

56:24.136 --> 56:26.004
Is anyone there?

56:26.036 --> 56:29.040
No, nada,
zip, zilch, nothing!

56:30.642 --> 56:33.445
It's like end
of the world around here.

56:35.613 --> 56:36.982
You could say that again.

56:37.015 --> 56:38.951
Almost out of scotch.

56:42.654 --> 56:45.158
So about the guns...

56:45.191 --> 56:48.060
Hey, fair trade for fair trade.

56:48.093 --> 56:50.129
I'm not the government.
I'm not a charity.

56:50.162 --> 56:51.930
I'm military.

57:34.507 --> 57:37.910
You know,
it's times like these

57:37.943 --> 57:41.883
that really make a girl
think about what she wants.

57:41.915 --> 57:43.851
Yeah,

57:45.151 --> 57:50.857
And you know
what I want

57:50.892 --> 57:56.530
more than a big strong man
to protect me?

57:59.798 --> 58:04.004
You must have so many guns

58:04.037 --> 58:08.943
just begging to be used.

58:08.975 --> 58:15.649
So you think you could
loan me just one?

58:17.084 --> 58:21.055
Yeah, I'm certain we can
come up with something.

58:21.088 --> 58:23.658
So what'll I get, a rifle

58:23.691 --> 58:25.694
or a pistol

58:25.726 --> 58:30.064
or a bazooka?

58:31.967 --> 58:32.969
What's wrong?

58:36.903 --> 58:38.206
Shit.

58:42.143 --> 58:43.178
No, no!

58:53.922 --> 58:56.559
You reptilian asshole.

58:56.592 --> 59:00.062
I was about to get laid.
It's been years.

59:00.095 --> 59:03.132
It's been years,
you son of a bitch!

59:03.166 --> 59:05.634
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

59:05.666 --> 59:06.537
Out of the way!

59:26.856 --> 59:27.924
Shit.

59:34.262 --> 59:36.732
Maybe Sampson got away.

59:36.765 --> 59:39.836
You know,
he could've survived.

59:41.403 --> 59:43.072
Here's his flask.

59:44.807 --> 59:47.779
Shit.

01:00:17.206 --> 01:00:19.176
How did it find us?

01:00:19.208 --> 01:00:20.745
I mean, they're just animals.

01:00:20.777 --> 01:00:21.912
How the hell
can something like that

01:00:21.945 --> 01:00:23.313
track us across
a whole damn city?

01:00:23.346 --> 01:00:24.916
I don't know.

01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.922
Wait a minute.
I think I do know.

01:00:32.955 --> 01:00:35.092
It's this thing.

01:00:35.126 --> 01:00:36.226
What do you mean?

01:00:36.259 --> 01:00:37.662
Dude, think about it.

01:00:37.695 --> 01:00:39.129
The minute we picked up
this rock,

01:00:39.163 --> 01:00:40.999
those things have been on us
like fleas on a dog.

01:00:41.032 --> 01:00:42.833
They want the rock back.

01:00:42.866 --> 01:00:44.269
But that's our cash crop.

01:00:44.302 --> 01:00:45.969
We can't just
throw it away, man.

01:00:46.002 --> 01:00:47.738
I mean what about the business?
What about your truck?

01:00:47.771 --> 01:00:49.673
It doesn't matter
if we're already dead.

01:00:49.706 --> 01:00:51.309
Lars, keep your voice down.

01:00:51.342 --> 01:00:52.743
No, I will not.

01:00:52.775 --> 01:00:54.246
Just think about it
for a second.

01:00:54.278 --> 01:00:56.313
This whole damn thing
wouldn't have happened

01:00:56.347 --> 01:01:00.017
if Romeo here hadn't talked us
into going along

01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:02.220
on this prehistoric
joyride through hell.

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:04.856
Christ, Jonas, I mean,

01:01:04.889 --> 01:01:06.258
people are getting killed
over this thing.

01:01:06.291 --> 01:01:07.892
So it's all my fault now.

01:01:07.925 --> 01:01:09.461
Yes, it goddamn is.

01:01:09.495 --> 01:01:11.998
The same as it's been, what,
the last dozen times

01:01:12.031 --> 01:01:13.798
I've gone along
with one of your schemes?

01:01:13.831 --> 01:01:15.267
-Hey!
-Guys...

01:01:15.301 --> 01:01:17.068
Just because you don't
want to dream, man,

01:01:17.102 --> 01:01:18.871
don't try to bring me down
because I've got one.

01:01:18.904 --> 01:01:21.340
Your dream
is my nightmare, okay?

01:01:21.373 --> 01:01:23.076
And this one's
gonna end up with us

01:01:23.108 --> 01:01:25.344
up to our necks
in prehistoric pigeons!

01:01:26.344 --> 01:01:27.779
Guys!

01:01:27.812 --> 01:01:29.214
Can you work this out
some other time?

01:01:37.455 --> 01:01:39.257
Looks like
the bullet theory works.

01:01:39.290 --> 01:01:40.826
Jesus.

01:01:40.859 --> 01:01:42.160
How about you guys
stow your drama,

01:01:42.194 --> 01:01:43.830
drop your dicks,
pick up your guns,

01:01:43.862 --> 01:01:45.931
and kill some reptile?

01:01:53.039 --> 01:01:56.444
Move, move, move, move, move.

01:01:59.311 --> 01:02:01.146
Well, this is a fine mess.

01:02:04.817 --> 01:02:07.786
This is not my fault.

01:02:13.159 --> 01:02:14.126
Yeah?

01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.429
Well, this is the kind of thing

01:02:15.461 --> 01:02:17.230
your schemes always get us into.

01:02:17.264 --> 01:02:19.066
My schemes?
My schemes?

01:02:22.068 --> 01:02:25.839
When have my schemes ever gotten
us into anything like this?

01:02:25.871 --> 01:02:27.475
Guys, will you shut up
and shoot something?

01:02:31.978 --> 01:02:33.180
This is crazy!

01:02:33.213 --> 01:02:34.515
They're like a goddamn army!

01:02:48.394 --> 01:02:50.899
Why are you laughing?

01:02:50.931 --> 01:02:52.968
Dude, I just took out,
like, four of them.

01:02:54.934 --> 01:02:56.037
Well, keep it up!

01:03:20.862 --> 01:03:22.363
All right!

01:03:22.395 --> 01:03:24.099
We got them on the run!

01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:35.144
Shit.

01:03:41.215 --> 01:03:42.417
Nice shot.

01:03:42.450 --> 01:03:44.420
Goddamn, I'm happy to see you.

01:03:44.452 --> 01:03:47.288
Don't be too happy.
I'm all out of bullets.

01:03:47.322 --> 01:03:48.891
Well, shit,
let's stock up, then.

01:03:48.924 --> 01:03:50.592
And get the hell
out of dodge.

01:03:50.626 --> 01:03:52.395
There's got to be somewhere
where these things ain't.

01:03:54.896 --> 01:03:57.032
I locked one in the armory.

01:03:57.065 --> 01:03:59.169
Just one?

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:00.469
That ain't so bad.

01:04:04.338 --> 01:04:06.108
God damn it.

01:04:19.954 --> 01:04:20.624
You okay?

01:04:22.258 --> 01:04:24.294
What a goddamn horrible day.

01:04:26.129 --> 01:04:27.897
Jesus.

01:04:28.997 --> 01:04:32.034
What?

01:04:32.035 --> 01:04:32.971
Barbecue.

01:04:36.572 --> 01:04:38.407
God, how hard is it
to kill this asshole?

01:04:46.349 --> 01:04:47.551
Hey, you oversized iguana!

01:04:52.056 --> 01:04:54.091
Goddamn, that's hard to throw.

01:04:58.728 --> 01:04:59.963
Crap.

01:04:59.996 --> 01:05:01.232
Lars!

01:05:04.668 --> 01:05:05.569
-Lars, no!
-Lars!

01:05:05.601 --> 01:05:07.003
Help!

01:05:07.036 --> 01:05:08.505
Put me down! Put me down!
Jonas!

01:05:08.538 --> 01:05:12.042
-God, I'm gonna kill you!
-No, no, no, no!

01:05:12.076 --> 01:05:13.144
What do you mean no?

01:05:13.177 --> 01:05:14.278
Let's go after him!

01:05:14.311 --> 01:05:16.314
Come on!

01:05:16.346 --> 01:05:19.583
Put me down!

01:05:21.719 --> 01:05:23.087
Come on!

01:05:23.119 --> 01:05:24.022
Where is he?

01:05:28.558 --> 01:05:29.727
God damn it!

01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.194
There! Come on!

01:05:31.228 --> 01:05:32.964
God damn it, Jonas!

01:05:35.032 --> 01:05:36.301
Come on!

01:05:36.334 --> 01:05:38.336
-Lars!
-Jonas!

01:05:38.369 --> 01:05:39.738
Put me down.

01:05:39.771 --> 01:05:41.371
No, on second thought,
don't put me down.

01:05:43.108 --> 01:05:46.111
You stupid lizard,
bird, reptile.

01:05:48.145 --> 01:05:50.548
Jesus, look at this.

01:05:50.582 --> 01:05:52.551
It's a slaughterhouse.

01:05:52.584 --> 01:05:55.587
I mean, where's the police,
the national guard, anyone?

01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:57.522
Anyone who's smart's
hiding right now.

01:05:57.555 --> 01:05:59.558
Yeah, what does that make us?

01:05:59.591 --> 01:06:02.227
Jonas! God damn it.

01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:05.263
-Come on, this way, come on.
-God damn it!

01:06:15.472 --> 01:06:17.442
I'll be there this sunday,

01:06:17.476 --> 01:06:19.211
'cause I'm kill Jonas,
and it's gonna be his funeral.

01:06:19.243 --> 01:06:20.612
Jonas!

01:06:20.645 --> 01:06:21.546
Through here. Through here.

01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:22.580
Come on, come on!

01:06:33.225 --> 01:06:34.560
Get down. Get down. Get down.

01:06:46.705 --> 01:06:48.541
It's coming. It's coming.

01:06:52.412 --> 01:06:53.613
It's coming.

01:06:55.782 --> 01:06:57.485
What's that sound?

01:07:04.291 --> 01:07:05.626
A swarm!

01:07:22.408 --> 01:07:23.276
Sorry.

01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.682
God damn it!

01:07:28.715 --> 01:07:29.717
Lars.

01:07:29.750 --> 01:07:31.385
Come on.

01:07:31.418 --> 01:07:34.421
God, this is worse
than flying into LAX.

01:07:34.454 --> 01:07:36.658
-Come on.
-I'm coming.

01:07:39.527 --> 01:07:40.494
Did we lose him?

01:07:40.526 --> 01:07:41.529
I don't know.

01:07:43.729 --> 01:07:45.433
God damn it!

01:07:45.466 --> 01:07:47.568
Not as long as he's
got air in his lungs

01:07:47.601 --> 01:07:48.603
and curses on his tongue.

01:07:48.636 --> 01:07:50.105
Come on!

01:07:50.138 --> 01:07:51.640
Jonas,
I'm gonna kill you!

01:07:56.344 --> 01:07:57.846
-Christ on a stick!
-No!

01:08:02.583 --> 01:08:05.553
That's got to be their nest.

01:08:05.585 --> 01:08:08.122
Jonas, we can't just go
cowboying into there.

01:08:08.156 --> 01:08:09.424
We can't just
leave him in there.

01:08:09.457 --> 01:08:11.125
They're gonna
tear him to shreds.

01:08:11.158 --> 01:08:13.362
If we go in there,
they'll tear us to shreds.

01:08:16.330 --> 01:08:17.564
I got him into this.

01:08:19.367 --> 01:08:21.868
That's Lars up there,

01:08:21.902 --> 01:08:24.305
and I'm gonna
do something about it.

01:08:40.656 --> 01:08:43.526
What kind of hangover is this?

01:08:44.725 --> 01:08:47.464
What the...

01:08:47.496 --> 01:08:48.796
Hey there, Barbecue.

01:08:50.365 --> 01:08:52.434
Take it easy.

01:08:52.466 --> 01:08:55.304
Hope you're still not sore
about, you know...

01:08:56.537 --> 01:08:58.473
It's not as bad
as what Jonas did.

01:08:58.506 --> 01:09:01.377
I mean, he burned your face off.

01:09:05.647 --> 01:09:06.517
What?

01:09:08.783 --> 01:09:09.920
God damn it.

01:09:09.952 --> 01:09:11.353
God damn it.

01:09:11.386 --> 01:09:13.357
God damn it!

01:09:26.970 --> 01:09:28.606
I'll be damned.

01:09:35.479 --> 01:09:37.846
Those weren't no meteorites.

01:09:37.881 --> 01:09:39.183
They were eggs.

01:09:41.652 --> 01:09:44.755
They were you
falling from the sky.

01:09:44.787 --> 01:09:46.756
My God.

01:09:54.631 --> 01:09:55.566
Yes.

01:09:59.402 --> 01:10:00.605
What are we doing back here?

01:10:00.637 --> 01:10:01.738
I thought you
wanted to help him.

01:10:01.771 --> 01:10:03.341
I am.

01:10:03.373 --> 01:10:06.443
Jonas, we need to call
the cops, the military,

01:10:06.476 --> 01:10:07.979
somebody who knows
what they're doing.

01:10:08.011 --> 01:10:09.913
Have you seen any cops lately?

01:10:09.947 --> 01:10:11.916
And we know what happened
to the military.

01:10:11.948 --> 01:10:14.018
Jonas, it's suicide.

01:10:14.051 --> 01:10:16.222
You go back in there,
you're not coming back out.

01:10:17.921 --> 01:10:20.324
Damn it, Jonas,
you can't do this.

01:10:20.356 --> 01:10:24.461
I don't want you
to die before I...

01:10:24.494 --> 01:10:25.931
Before what?

01:10:27.865 --> 01:10:31.302
Before I get the chance
to really know you.

01:10:34.472 --> 01:10:37.976
I spent my entire life
making nothing of myself.

01:10:38.008 --> 01:10:41.413
Just making things.

01:10:41.445 --> 01:10:43.948
I thought being clever
was enough, but it ain't.

01:10:45.016 --> 01:10:46.418
I can't just let him sit there.

01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:48.520
I've got to do something.

01:10:50.722 --> 01:10:52.391
I owe him that.

01:10:54.825 --> 01:10:56.728
Well, if that's
how it's gonna be,

01:10:56.762 --> 01:11:00.598
then you're gonna need someone
to keep you on your feet.

01:11:00.632 --> 01:11:02.969
They brought the fight to us.

01:11:03.001 --> 01:11:05.638
I say we bring it back to them.

01:11:05.670 --> 01:11:08.440
You sure you want to do this?

01:11:08.472 --> 01:11:10.309
You think you even have
a say in that matter?

01:11:14.579 --> 01:11:17.849
Those goddamn flying lizards
better watch out.

01:11:17.882 --> 01:11:20.453
'Cause we're gonna
make them extinct again.

01:13:02.224 --> 01:13:04.759
Hey, don't worry.

01:13:04.792 --> 01:13:07.595
I ain't moving
after that last hit.

01:13:07.627 --> 01:13:08.965
Jerk.

01:13:15.604 --> 01:13:17.774
Sweet mother of God.

01:13:21.008 --> 01:13:22.878
Why are you going
toward that building?

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:45.501
Hi.

01:13:45.534 --> 01:13:46.670
Hey.

01:13:46.703 --> 01:13:49.473
Where am I? What is happening?

01:13:50.605 --> 01:13:52.942
Lars.
Lars Wales.

01:13:52.976 --> 01:13:54.477
Johnny.
Johnny Dean.

01:13:54.510 --> 01:13:57.047
Well, Johnny Dean,

01:13:57.078 --> 01:14:00.049
to answer your first question,

01:14:00.083 --> 01:14:03.186
we're in the middle
of a shit storm.

01:14:03.218 --> 01:14:04.687
Yeah, these ugly bastards

01:14:04.721 --> 01:14:06.822
have taken up shop
in this apartment here,

01:14:06.856 --> 01:14:10.594
which I believe belonged
to a couple of artist types.

01:14:10.627 --> 01:14:12.795
I'm gonna be honest
with you, Johnny.

01:14:12.829 --> 01:14:15.599
I don't know a damn thing
about art.

01:14:15.632 --> 01:14:18.067
But I got to say,
I mean, it's pretty good.

01:14:32.649 --> 01:14:34.018
How can you stay so calm?

01:14:34.050 --> 01:14:37.621
Look, there's no reason
in panicking, okay?

01:14:37.655 --> 01:14:39.823
Just take it easy.

01:14:39.857 --> 01:14:42.192
Come on, haven't you ever
been in a fight before?

01:14:42.226 --> 01:14:46.229
All we got to do is stay calm,
look for our opening,

01:14:46.263 --> 01:14:47.998
and then we give them
a real fight.

01:14:48.030 --> 01:14:48.967
Bastards.

01:14:51.735 --> 01:14:53.271
What are they doing now?

01:14:55.272 --> 01:14:59.110
Why don't they just eat us?

01:14:59.143 --> 01:15:02.213
I think that's because their
young like their food fresh.

01:15:18.129 --> 01:15:20.966
You ready to do this?

01:15:20.998 --> 01:15:22.732
Yeah.

01:15:22.766 --> 01:15:24.702
Let's kick some past.

01:15:45.823 --> 01:15:48.627
How high up did you say
that nest was?

01:15:48.661 --> 01:15:51.063
24th, 25th floor, probably.

01:15:52.697 --> 01:15:54.099
You know, I was thinking

01:15:54.131 --> 01:15:55.801
I could totally use
the exercise.

01:15:58.404 --> 01:15:59.371
No?

01:15:59.403 --> 01:16:00.572
Damn it.

01:16:03.174 --> 01:16:04.244
Shit.

01:16:13.918 --> 01:16:15.121
What's he doing?

01:16:15.154 --> 01:16:16.890
Why is he looking
at me like that?

01:16:18.658 --> 01:16:20.893
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, please!

01:16:20.926 --> 01:16:22.695
No, take him!
Take him! No!

01:16:22.729 --> 01:16:25.932
No, no, no please!

01:16:25.966 --> 01:16:28.868
I pay my taxes!
I'm a good person!

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:30.604
No!

01:16:40.378 --> 01:16:42.181
-Little help here.
-I'm trying.

01:16:42.214 --> 01:16:45.019
I didn't really have time
to test this stuff.

01:16:49.756 --> 01:16:50.724
How about that?

01:16:59.732 --> 01:17:00.967
Burn that bastard!

01:17:12.111 --> 01:17:14.649
God.

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:19.387
Well, that wasn't so bad.

01:17:25.491 --> 01:17:27.762
You just had to say it,
didn't you?

01:17:36.437 --> 01:17:39.775
You are one
big ugly mother...

01:17:51.852 --> 01:17:52.721
Jonas.

01:17:55.455 --> 01:17:56.959
Jonas!

01:18:03.398 --> 01:18:05.300
Come on. Come on!

01:18:43.205 --> 01:18:47.277
I feel like I should
say something patriotic.

01:18:55.018 --> 01:18:55.886
You coming?

01:19:06.362 --> 01:19:09.032
Take it easy, Barbecue.
Come on, man.

01:19:16.872 --> 01:19:18.909
You're awfully calm.

01:19:20.309 --> 01:19:22.179
All right, fine.
This is it?

01:19:22.212 --> 01:19:24.147
Come on!

01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:25.550
Come on, you son of a bitch!

01:19:33.157 --> 01:19:34.993
Come on! Come on, then.

01:19:36.159 --> 01:19:37.494
-Lars.
-Lars.

01:19:37.528 --> 01:19:38.428
Son of a...

01:19:38.462 --> 01:19:39.463
Lars!

01:19:39.495 --> 01:19:40.531
Jonas.

01:19:58.215 --> 01:20:00.118
Take it easy, Barbecue.

01:20:00.151 --> 01:20:02.387
Sorry about burning your face.

01:20:06.658 --> 01:20:08.258
You're even uglier
than the big ones.

01:20:08.292 --> 01:20:09.527
Lars!

01:20:09.561 --> 01:20:11.495
Jonas!

01:20:11.528 --> 01:20:12.431
Lars.

01:20:29.146 --> 01:20:30.114
Light 'em up.

01:20:47.599 --> 01:20:49.936
-Reloading.
-Got it.

01:20:56.142 --> 01:20:56.809
Ready.

01:21:00.679 --> 01:21:03.048
Shoot 'em! Shoot 'em all!

01:21:17.295 --> 01:21:19.665
Not now. Shit.
Come on.

01:21:48.996 --> 01:21:50.431
You again.

01:21:52.532 --> 01:21:54.101
Back.

01:21:54.134 --> 01:21:55.336
Go on.

01:22:00.540 --> 01:22:01.609
Bring it.

01:22:22.363 --> 01:22:25.167
All right, let's see
if you can fly.

01:22:44.351 --> 01:22:46.288
Not so lazy now?

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:54.095
I'm sorry, buddy.

01:22:54.127 --> 01:22:55.229
I'm glad
you didn't quit on me.

01:22:55.262 --> 01:22:56.699
Never, man.

01:22:56.731 --> 01:22:59.167
Was that my new leaf blower?

01:23:01.135 --> 01:23:02.004
It still works.

01:23:04.538 --> 01:23:07.042
Always nice to see
a little man love.

01:23:08.811 --> 01:23:11.280
How's it going, Lars?

01:23:11.312 --> 01:23:14.449
A lot better now that
I'm no longer on the menu.

01:23:16.418 --> 01:23:19.188
Crap, that's right.

01:23:19.221 --> 01:23:22.391
Guys, we got bigger problems
than fishing me

01:23:22.423 --> 01:23:25.261
out of a dino's
digestive tract.

01:23:25.293 --> 01:23:27.329
There's your 20%.

01:23:27.362 --> 01:23:29.765
They're breeding.

01:23:29.798 --> 01:23:32.301
Yeah, but not here.

01:23:32.333 --> 01:23:34.137
They're bringing them
from somewhere else.

01:23:36.371 --> 01:23:38.339
Hey, hey, guys, guys.

01:23:38.373 --> 01:23:42.679
Does that look
like Sampson to you?

01:23:42.711 --> 01:23:44.080
Looks like he wasn't

01:23:44.114 --> 01:23:45.682
the only one
that collected trophies.

01:23:45.714 --> 01:23:47.550
-What?
-Poor bastard.

01:23:47.584 --> 01:23:49.452
What a way to go.

01:23:52.321 --> 01:23:54.257
What is that?

01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:56.226
Where am I?

01:23:56.258 --> 01:23:58.227
Jeez.

01:24:01.897 --> 01:24:04.133
My God.

01:24:04.166 --> 01:24:06.702
Leather-skinned bastard
drove me through a wall

01:24:06.736 --> 01:24:10.107
and still couldn't kill
old Sampson.

01:24:10.139 --> 01:24:13.309
And now you kids
are here to rescue me?

01:24:13.343 --> 01:24:16.680
We'll show them reptili-birds
what's what, right?

01:24:18.848 --> 01:24:21.486
Now, who's gonna help me
get out of here?

01:24:23.386 --> 01:24:25.188
I don't suppose
anyone thought

01:24:25.222 --> 01:24:27.692
to bring my flask
with them, did they?

01:24:30.227 --> 01:24:31.429
No.

01:24:31.461 --> 01:24:33.464
Must've slipped my mind.

01:24:33.496 --> 01:24:36.633
There's got to be something
to drink around this place.

01:24:41.205 --> 01:24:42.607
Hey, what's wrong?

01:24:42.639 --> 01:24:44.541
The eggs.

01:24:44.575 --> 01:24:46.844
Why are they bringing them here?

01:24:46.876 --> 01:24:49.312
They're building a new nest?
It makes no sense.

01:24:49.345 --> 01:24:50.615
Unless they're all males,

01:24:50.648 --> 01:24:52.518
but then
where are all the females?

01:24:52.550 --> 01:24:54.185
Wait, how do you know
these ain't female?

01:24:54.218 --> 01:24:55.820
I mean, did you look?

01:24:55.854 --> 01:24:57.421
Maybe they're waiting
for something.

01:24:57.453 --> 01:25:01.527
Maybe... maybe
they're like ants or bees.

01:25:01.560 --> 01:25:03.861
How so?

01:25:06.697 --> 01:25:09.235
There's always a queen.

01:25:18.842 --> 01:25:21.180
God damn it.

01:25:37.962 --> 01:25:39.332
Move.

01:25:39.364 --> 01:25:41.232
-Move!
-Yeah.

01:25:52.444 --> 01:25:55.480
Hey, guys, I'd say right now
is a great time to retire

01:25:55.513 --> 01:25:56.916
from the monster-hunting
business?

01:25:56.949 --> 01:25:59.986
No, no, no, we need to end this.

01:26:00.019 --> 01:26:03.690
Jonas, we can't just stay here.

01:26:03.722 --> 01:26:06.693
We need to kill it,
here and now.

01:26:06.726 --> 01:26:08.394
-This may be our only chance.
-Yeah?

01:26:08.427 --> 01:26:10.498
And how do you propose
we do that?

01:26:17.370 --> 01:26:19.305
With that?
No, no way.

01:26:19.337 --> 01:26:20.740
That is not enough explosives.

01:26:20.773 --> 01:26:22.374
Come on, man,
look at that thing.

01:26:22.408 --> 01:26:24.276
It's, like, a half a dozen
stories tall.

01:26:24.310 --> 01:26:26.013
Then we need something
that's gonna make a bigger boom.

01:26:26.045 --> 01:26:28.013
Yeah, like what?

01:26:28.047 --> 01:26:30.718
Great news, everyone.

01:26:30.750 --> 01:26:32.919
I found the liquor cabinet!

01:26:35.355 --> 01:26:36.290
What?

01:26:37.922 --> 01:26:39.726
How many more do we got?

01:26:39.759 --> 01:26:40.994
How many more do you need?

01:26:45.999 --> 01:26:48.569
No! Wait!
You don't understand.

01:26:48.602 --> 01:26:50.537
What are we doing?
This better work.

01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:51.739
They can't use that one.

01:26:51.771 --> 01:26:54.874
Listen, it's not fair!
Please!

01:26:54.908 --> 01:26:56.677
All I wanted to do
was have a drink.

01:26:56.709 --> 01:26:58.311
Just a drink.

01:26:58.344 --> 01:26:59.713
Come on!

01:26:59.745 --> 01:27:01.914
Is that
so much to ask?

01:27:01.947 --> 01:27:04.253
-No, no, no!
-Will you hurry up, please?

01:27:13.361 --> 01:27:14.963
-All right.
-Now...

01:27:14.996 --> 01:27:17.399
we just got to get
its attention.

01:27:17.432 --> 01:27:20.302
How are we gonna do that?

01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:21.737
I think I know how.

01:27:45.493 --> 01:27:48.531
Okay, maybe a little
too much attention.

01:27:56.036 --> 01:27:58.107
It's coming.
Pull the pins.

01:27:58.139 --> 01:27:59.907
Pull the pins.
Pull the pins. Pull the pins.

01:27:59.941 --> 01:28:01.511
Pull the pins!

01:28:22.399 --> 01:28:24.033
Sit tight, kiddo.

01:28:24.065 --> 01:28:27.036
It's my turn to kill
one of these bastards.

01:28:28.538 --> 01:28:30.439
In the name
of my forefathers

01:28:30.471 --> 01:28:32.743
and alcoholics everywhere!

01:28:51.927 --> 01:28:53.930
Have a drink!

01:29:12.216 --> 01:29:13.618
Say it, Lars.
You know you want to.

01:29:13.650 --> 01:29:14.951
Goddamn...

01:29:36.673 --> 01:29:38.176
Good one, Sampson!

01:29:40.478 --> 01:29:41.712
Never thought
I'd actually say this,

01:29:41.744 --> 01:29:43.013
but I think
I'm gonna miss him.

01:29:46.016 --> 01:29:47.753
Hey, guys, I think
it's still alive.

01:29:47.785 --> 01:29:49.153
Jeez!

01:29:54.092 --> 01:29:55.625
Sampson!

01:29:55.659 --> 01:29:56.862
My God, yes!

01:29:56.894 --> 01:29:57.830
Yes!

01:30:00.165 --> 01:30:01.733
I'm okay.

01:30:03.235 --> 01:30:04.803
Just a little juicy, I guess.

01:30:04.835 --> 01:30:05.937
Shame about the head.

01:30:05.970 --> 01:30:07.505
Would've made a fine trophy.

01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:10.541
It's okay, the bitch probably

01:30:10.575 --> 01:30:12.978
wouldn't have fit
on the wall anyway.

01:30:14.245 --> 01:30:16.748
Hey, look!
The cavalry's arrived.

01:30:20.785 --> 01:30:21.921
Screw 'em!

01:30:21.953 --> 01:30:25.224
I got this one fair and square.

01:30:29.193 --> 01:30:31.130
Not so scary now, am I?

01:30:35.001 --> 01:30:38.770
Let's just say I'm allowed to
sweep you off your feet a little.

01:30:38.804 --> 01:30:40.773
Hey, Lars, you gonna be ready
for work on Monday?

01:30:40.805 --> 01:30:42.740
I think I need a break
from the yard care business.

01:30:42.773 --> 01:30:44.643
What do you have in mind?

01:30:44.676 --> 01:30:45.777
I need a vacation.

01:30:47.712 --> 01:30:51.518
Man, one hell of a way
to spend a weekend?

01:30:53.184 --> 01:30:54.987
I need a drink.

01:31:08.902 --> 01:31:12.071
Good evening, and welcome back to
"Tonight with Tommy Killingsworth,"

01:31:12.104 --> 01:31:14.139
the talk show that has
the interviews you want

01:31:14.173 --> 01:31:16.675
with the subjects
that matter most.

01:31:16.709 --> 01:31:20.212
Today we're talking about the
so-called terrordactyl invasion.

01:31:23.616 --> 01:31:25.085
Now, the remaining pterodactyls

01:31:25.118 --> 01:31:27.788
have been rounded up and sent
to an uninhabited island

01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:31.692
in South America where they're being
closely watched by the military.

01:31:31.725 --> 01:31:35.229
The question I have is,
what's gonna happen next?

01:31:35.261 --> 01:31:37.730
Now, all the pterodactyls,
if I'm not mistaken...

01:31:37.764 --> 01:31:39.033
Scumbag.

01:31:44.971 --> 01:31:48.141
Look at you, Rico Suave.
Very nice.

01:31:48.175 --> 01:31:49.711
Well, I figured
I had to step it up

01:31:49.744 --> 01:31:50.978
since you came
with the Elmer Fudd line.

01:31:51.010 --> 01:31:52.613
-Very nice.
-Funny, funny.

01:31:52.646 --> 01:31:53.980
Fashionably late, I see.

01:31:54.014 --> 01:31:55.684
That's what happens to a man

01:31:55.717 --> 01:31:57.552
when he gets caught out front
signing autographs.

01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:00.322
Wait, where's Candice?

01:32:00.355 --> 01:32:02.022
Stuck at her book signing.
Should've seen the line.

01:32:02.056 --> 01:32:03.725
-Shut up.
-Wrapped around the block.

01:32:03.757 --> 01:32:05.593
Check it out.

01:32:05.627 --> 01:32:07.095
How's he doing?

01:32:07.128 --> 01:32:09.331
-Same as always.
-That bad?

01:32:09.364 --> 01:32:12.133
With me tonight
are two pterodactyl experts:

01:32:12.166 --> 01:32:14.368
Sampson McLain,
who has been hailed as one

01:32:14.401 --> 01:32:17.271
of the heroes of Los Angeles
after a cell phone video

01:32:17.305 --> 01:32:19.807
of him helping defend the city
against the beasts

01:32:19.841 --> 01:32:21.376
went viral
in the days after.

01:32:21.409 --> 01:32:23.712
Dude... shit.

01:32:23.744 --> 01:32:25.613
We also have
Teresa Quinn,

01:32:25.646 --> 01:32:29.016
a biologist and astrophysicist
with Columbia University.

01:32:29.050 --> 01:32:32.354
Now, Sampson, I'm interested
in your thoughts

01:32:32.386 --> 01:32:35.823
about this pterodactyl
relocation project.

01:32:35.856 --> 01:32:37.392
Relocation?

01:32:37.426 --> 01:32:39.060
Listen, junior.

01:32:39.092 --> 01:32:41.296
The pterodactyls
have had their day.

01:32:41.328 --> 01:32:42.797
They're history.

01:32:42.830 --> 01:32:44.999
Actually, they're prehistory.

01:32:45.033 --> 01:32:46.902
It's now the day
of the human being,

01:32:46.935 --> 01:32:50.839
and it's our job to make sure
that it stays that way.

01:32:50.873 --> 01:32:52.842
As Americans,
we will never again

01:32:52.874 --> 01:32:55.310
be afraid of things
from the past.

01:32:55.343 --> 01:32:57.078
Listen, kiddo.

01:32:57.111 --> 01:33:00.016
I've seen things that would
really curl your hair.

01:33:01.083 --> 01:33:03.953
So did you ask her yet?

01:33:03.986 --> 01:33:05.254
Come on.

01:33:05.286 --> 01:33:07.123
What? Come on.
Don't be so worried.

01:33:07.155 --> 01:33:08.757
It's not that I'm worried.

01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:10.994
It's, like, you know, timing,
all that stuff.

01:33:11.027 --> 01:33:12.962
Well, whatever.
Let me see it.

01:33:12.995 --> 01:33:15.898
-Now?
-Yeah, come on, whip it out.

01:33:15.931 --> 01:33:17.733
All right.
Careful, though, okay?

01:33:17.767 --> 01:33:19.369
-Careful.
-Careful, careful, careful.

01:33:22.004 --> 01:33:24.074
Nice.

01:33:24.107 --> 01:33:25.808
Just one thing, though.

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:26.977
What? What? What?
What's wrong?

01:33:27.009 --> 01:33:28.378
Did you have
to get one so big?

01:33:28.411 --> 01:33:30.180
I mean, you're not
compensating, are you?

01:33:30.213 --> 01:33:32.815
What, 'cause my balls
ain't as big as my brain?

01:33:32.847 --> 01:33:35.351
No, I'll admit, you got that one
figured out just fine.

01:33:38.088 --> 01:33:41.023
Listen, slick,
I shot sharks in the river.

01:33:41.057 --> 01:33:42.925
I've wrestled grizzly bears.

01:33:42.959 --> 01:33:44.361
And for the pterodactyls,

01:33:44.393 --> 01:33:47.263
I've been
in the belly of the beast.

01:33:50.232 --> 01:33:52.735
Crap.
I think we're up next.

01:33:52.768 --> 01:33:54.303
I think somebody's
coming over here. Shit.

01:33:54.336 --> 01:33:55.806
They're ready
to mic you guys up.

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:56.939
-All right, thanks, man.
-Thanks, bro.

01:34:03.079 --> 01:34:04.348
We'll be ready.

01:34:04.381 --> 01:34:06.316
You can bet your sweet ass
on that, kiddo.

01:34:08.118 --> 01:34:11.488
Hey, Lars.
You coming?

01:34:11.522 --> 01:34:13.890
Can't keep doing
this goddamn job all by myself.

01:34:13.924 --> 01:34:15.126
God damn it.

01:34:18.796 --> 01:34:20.732
Grizzly bears, you say.

01:34:20.764 --> 01:34:22.099
Well, thank you, Sampson.

01:34:22.132 --> 01:34:24.202
That was very insightful.

01:34:25.836 --> 01:34:28.739
Ms. Quinn,
let's turn to you now.

01:34:28.773 --> 01:34:30.742
What are your thoughts?

01:34:30.774 --> 01:34:35.078
Well, since the beginning
of time, mankind has asked

01:34:35.112 --> 01:34:37.482
if anyone else
occupies the stars.

01:34:37.514 --> 01:34:39.851
And now we know.

01:34:39.885 --> 01:34:41.886
Our own past is up there,

01:34:41.919 --> 01:34:43.520
waiting to return.

01:34:43.554 --> 01:34:45.891
Containment is only
the first step toward

01:34:45.923 --> 01:34:49.862
preventing an attack like this
from happening again.

01:34:49.895 --> 01:34:51.864
We can learn much
from the pterodactyls,

01:34:51.896 --> 01:34:54.064
but we also must keep in mind

01:34:54.098 --> 01:34:56.802
this may have been
the first wave of these beasts.

01:34:58.569 --> 01:35:01.372
Who knows what other dangers
lurk in space,

01:35:01.405 --> 01:35:03.743
Waiting to fall
into our backyards?

01:35:05.543 --> 01:35:07.747
Who knows what's next?
