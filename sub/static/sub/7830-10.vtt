01:26.002 --> 01:28.463
Hello. I'm Leonard Nimoy.

01:28.546 --> 01:31.424
The following tale
of alien encounters is true

01:31.508 --> 01:34.219
and by true, I mean false.

01:34.302 --> 01:37.722
It's all lies,
but they're entertaining lies,

01:37.806 --> 01:40.892
and in the end,
isn't that the real truth?

01:40.975 --> 01:44.270
The answer is "no."

01:44.354 --> 01:46.523
Our story begins
on a friday morning

01:46.606 --> 01:50.360
in a little town
called Springfield.

01:50.443 --> 01:53.488
T.G.I.F., guys.
I'm off to Moe's.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.281
But, Homer, it's 10:00
in the morning.

01:55.365 --> 01:56.825
Don't worry, I have a plan.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.368
I saw this in a movie

01:58.451 --> 02:00.787
about a bus that had
to "speed" around a city

02:00.870 --> 02:03.039
keeping its "speed" over 50

02:03.123 --> 02:06.251
and if its "speed" dropped,
it would explode.

02:06.334 --> 02:08.086
I think it was called...

02:08.169 --> 02:11.256
"The Bus That Couldn't
Slow Down."

02:11.339 --> 02:15.176
First, I hook this common VCR
into the security camera system

02:15.260 --> 02:16.928
like so...

02:17.011 --> 02:20.223
then I insert this old
videotape of us working

02:20.306 --> 02:22.100
on a continuous loop.

02:24.727 --> 02:26.604
(no audible dialogue)

02:38.074 --> 02:39.784
So, another
Friday is upon us.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.494
What'll you be
doing, Smithers?

02:41.578 --> 02:43.037
Something gay, no doubt.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.622
Wha...? What?!

02:44.706 --> 02:46.416
You know,
lighthearted, fancy-free.

02:46.499 --> 02:48.168
Mothers, lock up
your daughters.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.128
Smithers is
on the town.

02:50.211 --> 02:52.755
(laughing)
Exactly, sir.

02:52.839 --> 02:55.175
(nervous chuckling)

02:55.258 --> 02:57.927
Thank God it's Wednesday.

02:58.011 --> 02:59.470
It's Friday.

02:59.554 --> 03:02.140
Uh-oh. Wrong pills.

03:03.933 --> 03:05.935
Uh... little help?

03:11.774 --> 03:13.651
Sorry, Donkey Kong.

03:13.735 --> 03:15.695
You're just not
a draw anymore.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.199
Hey, he's still got it.

03:21.117 --> 03:25.622
MILHOUSE:
...38, 39, 40 quarters.

03:25.705 --> 03:26.831
This better be good.

03:30.543 --> 03:33.296
<i>Game over.</i>
<i>Please deposit 40 quarters.</i>

03:33.379 --> 03:35.423
What a rip!

03:39.469 --> 03:41.429
Thank God it's Friday.

03:41.512 --> 03:43.097
(hums)

03:44.474 --> 03:46.059
-(X-ray machine buzzing)
-Hello?

03:47.685 --> 03:48.895
Hello?

03:54.317 --> 03:55.610
(dog growling)

03:56.861 --> 03:58.321
Bad dog!

03:58.404 --> 03:59.405

03:59.489 --> 04:01.115
Bad cat!

04:02.951 --> 04:05.036
Bad fawn!
Hmm.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.914
-Shoo-shoo!
-All right!

04:07.997 --> 04:10.875
It's time for ABC's
"T.G.I.F. lineup."

04:10.959 --> 04:12.877
Lis, when you get
a little older

04:12.961 --> 04:15.046
you'll learn that Friday's
just another day

04:15.129 --> 04:17.465
between NBC's
"Must-See Thursday"

04:17.548 --> 04:20.760
and CBS's "Saturday
Night Craparama."

04:20.843 --> 04:22.804
Another Duff, Homer?

04:22.887 --> 04:25.014
Nah. It's Friday
night, Moe.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.599
I want to
try something special.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.393
Uh, sure, sure.

04:28.476 --> 04:30.103
Eh, here you go.

04:30.186 --> 04:32.438
"Doof-uh."
From Sweden.

04:32.522 --> 04:34.482
Skoal!

04:34.565 --> 04:36.776
Wait a minute.
This is Duff.

04:36.859 --> 04:38.278
(laughing)

04:38.361 --> 04:39.487
You got me, didn't you?

04:39.570 --> 04:42.240
All right, here you go--
Red tick beer.

04:43.324 --> 04:46.327
Hmm.
Bold, refreshing.

04:46.411 --> 04:49.789
And something I can't
quite put my finger on.

04:49.872 --> 04:52.625
(barking)

04:52.709 --> 04:55.295
Hmm... needs more dog.

04:55.378 --> 04:58.673
(snoring)

04:58.756 --> 05:00.842
Well, it's 1:00 A.M.
Better go home

05:00.925 --> 05:03.052
and spend some quality time
with the kids.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.387
Just a second, Homer.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.055
You got to take
a breathalyzer test

05:06.139 --> 05:07.473
before I let you drive home.

06:02.320 --> 06:04.280
Oh, son, I'm
glad to see you.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.699
I went for the morning paper
and I got lost.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.576
-No time for you, old man.

Don't be afraid.

06:52.703 --> 06:54.831
-(panting)
-Homer, it's 2:00 A.M.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.125
-What happened?
-It was an alien, Marge.

06:57.208 --> 07:00.253
It appeared in front of me
and said, "Don't be afraid."

07:00.336 --> 07:01.337
Have you been
drinking?

07:01.421 --> 07:03.548
No... Well, ten beers.

07:03.631 --> 07:04.549
(groans)

07:04.632 --> 07:06.092
HOMER: I'm telling you

07:06.175 --> 07:08.261
I saw a creature
from another planet.

07:08.344 --> 07:09.762
Maybe you just dreamed it.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.806
Oh, yeah?
Well, when I came to

07:11.889 --> 07:13.933
I was covered with
a sticky translucent goo.

07:14.016 --> 07:15.268
Explain that.

07:15.351 --> 07:18.104
-More sausage?
-(drooling)

07:18.187 --> 07:20.815
Dad, according to
"Junior Skeptic Magazine,"

07:20.898 --> 07:23.359
the chances are
175 million to one

07:23.443 --> 07:26.863
of another form of life actually
coming in contact with ours.

07:26.946 --> 07:28.406
-So?
-It's just that

07:28.489 --> 07:29.866
the people who claim
they've seen aliens

07:29.949 --> 07:32.869
are always pathetic lowlifes
with boring jobs.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.746
Oh, and you, Dad.

07:35.830 --> 07:37.290
(chuckles weakly)

07:38.416 --> 07:41.043
I am the thing from Uranus.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.170
(shrieks)

07:42.253 --> 07:44.130
Oh, it's Bart.

07:44.213 --> 07:45.548
I can't believe it.

07:45.631 --> 07:48.259
I'm being mocked
by my own children.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.011
On my birthday.

07:50.094 --> 07:52.138
-It's your birthday?
-Yes.

07:52.221 --> 07:54.432
Remember, it's the same day
as the dog's.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.767
Santa's Little Helper,
it's your birthday?

07:56.851 --> 07:59.353
Ooh, we've got to
get you a present.

07:59.437 --> 08:01.898
Yes, we do.
Yes, we do.

08:01.981 --> 08:03.441
We love you, boy.

08:03.524 --> 08:06.694
Good doggy. Good doggy.

08:06.777 --> 08:08.488
Lousy lovable dog.

08:09.530 --> 08:11.365
Oh, it was awful.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.951
They set me
on a cold metal table,

08:14.035 --> 08:17.330
and prodded me
with humiliating probes, and--

08:17.413 --> 08:19.207
Oh, wait.
That was my physical.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.291
(men scoff)

08:20.374 --> 08:21.959
Great story, Homer,
really.

08:22.043 --> 08:25.046
The alien has
a sweet heavenly voice...

08:25.129 --> 08:26.464
Like Urkel.

08:26.547 --> 08:29.467
And he appears
every Friday night...

08:29.550 --> 08:30.927
Like Urkel.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.888
Well, your story
is very compelling,

08:33.971 --> 08:36.474
Mr. Jackass.
I mean, uh, Simpson.

08:36.557 --> 08:40.269
So I'll just type it up
on my invisible typewriter.

08:40.353 --> 08:43.481
(humming)

08:43.564 --> 08:46.442
(sighs) You don't have
to humiliate me.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.322
I just torched
a building downtown

08:51.405 --> 08:52.532
and I'm afraid
I'll do it again.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.325
Oh, yeah, right.

08:54.408 --> 08:57.537
I'll just type it up on
my invisible typewriter.

08:57.620 --> 09:00.248
(humming)

09:01.457 --> 09:02.416
Fruitcake.

09:11.467 --> 09:12.927
Look at this, Scully.

09:14.595 --> 09:16.597
There's been another
unsubstantiated U.F.O. sighting

09:16.681 --> 09:18.349
in the heartland
of America.

09:18.432 --> 09:19.725
We've got to get there
right away.

09:19.809 --> 09:21.352
Well, gee, Mulder,

09:21.435 --> 09:23.312
there's also this report
of a shipment of drugs

09:23.396 --> 09:25.481
and illegal weapons coming
into New Jersey tonight.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.192
(scoffs) I hardly think
the F.B.I.'s concerned

09:28.276 --> 09:29.443
with matters like that.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.700
Hello. Can I help you?

09:35.783 --> 09:37.910
Agents Mulder
and Scully-- F.B.I.

09:37.994 --> 09:39.620
(gasps)
Is this about that pen

09:39.704 --> 09:41.205
that I took
from the post office?

09:41.289 --> 09:43.833
I-I swear, I didn't know
I put it in my purse.

09:43.916 --> 09:46.127
Then I was going to bring it back
but the dog chewed it up,

09:46.210 --> 09:49.046
and that just made things worse.
(hyperventilating)

09:49.130 --> 09:52.592
Actually, we're here to see your husband
about his U.F.O. encounter.

09:52.675 --> 09:56.721
Oh... come...
come in.

09:59.473 --> 10:01.434
SCULLY: Mr. Simpson,
look at this lineup

10:01.517 --> 10:03.811
and tell us if any of these are
the aliens you saw.

10:03.894 --> 10:06.480
Yo.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.149
No, I'm sorry.

10:08.232 --> 10:10.943
(all grumbling)

10:11.027 --> 10:12.737
Oh, this makes me
very angry.

10:14.655 --> 10:16.032
Now we're going
to run a few tests.

10:16.115 --> 10:18.117
This is
a simple lie detector.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.827
I'll ask you a few
"yes" or "no" questions,

10:19.910 --> 10:20.995
and you just
answer truthfully.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.580
Do you understand?

10:22.663 --> 10:23.581
Yes.

10:34.300 --> 10:36.302
Ow.

10:36.385 --> 10:38.512
(panting)

10:38.596 --> 10:40.806
Wait a minute, Scully.
What's the point of this test?

10:40.890 --> 10:42.308
No point.
I just thought

10:42.391 --> 10:43.976
he could stand to lose
a little weight.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.395
His jiggling
is almost hypnotic.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.606
Yes, it's like
a lava lamp.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.409
MULDER:
All right, Homer,

11:00.493 --> 11:01.994
we want you re-create
your every move

11:02.078 --> 11:04.038
the night you
saw this alien.

11:04.121 --> 11:06.374
Well, the evening began
at the gentleman's club,

11:06.457 --> 11:08.376
where we were
discussing Wittgenstein

11:08.459 --> 11:10.628
over a game
of backgammon.

11:10.711 --> 11:11.879
Mr. Simpson,
it's a felony

11:11.962 --> 11:13.506
to lie
to the F.B.I.

11:13.589 --> 11:15.383
We were sitting in Barney's car
eating packets of mustard.

11:15.466 --> 11:16.509
You happy?

11:17.843 --> 11:21.681
You are one
fine-looking woman, lady.

11:21.764 --> 11:23.516
If I wasn't married,

11:23.599 --> 11:26.227
I'd go out with you
like that.

11:27.978 --> 11:30.523
I am so sorry.

11:30.606 --> 11:32.024
Whatever you do,
don't tell Marge.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.567
God, I love her.

11:33.651 --> 11:35.528
I... Hey, a penny.

11:35.611 --> 11:38.030
So, who are you guys anyhow?

11:38.114 --> 11:39.198
Agents Mulder and Scully--

11:39.281 --> 11:40.908
F.B.I.

11:40.991 --> 11:41.992
F.B.I., huh?

11:42.076 --> 11:43.327
Uh, excuse me.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.080
All right, they're onto us.

11:46.163 --> 11:47.540
Get him back to Sea World.

11:47.623 --> 11:51.001
(vocalizing)

11:51.085 --> 11:54.255
So I says,
"Blue M&M, red M&M.

11:54.338 --> 11:57.341
They all wind up
the same color in the end."

11:57.425 --> 11:59.218
Homer, why don't you
show us where you went

11:59.301 --> 12:00.678
when you left the bar.

12:00.761 --> 12:02.763
I was standing
right here

12:02.847 --> 12:04.849
when the horrible creature
emerged from the woods.

12:08.144 --> 12:10.187
For the love of God, help me!

12:10.271 --> 12:11.564
I've been here for four days,

12:11.647 --> 12:13.733
and a turtle's
got a hold of my teeth.

12:13.816 --> 12:16.777
There he is.

12:16.861 --> 12:18.404
Come back here, you.

12:18.487 --> 12:20.614
Slow down.
I'll get you.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.202
This is the worst
assignment we've ever had.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.537
Worse than the time

12:26.620 --> 12:29.123
we were attacked by
the flesh-eating virus?

12:29.206 --> 12:32.752
Ow! He bit me
with my own teeth!

12:32.835 --> 12:34.628
No, this is much
more irritating.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.380
I've seen enough, Mulder.
Let's go.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.840
Yeah, okay.

12:37.923 --> 12:40.050
But somewhere out there,
something is watching us.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.302
There are alien forces

12:41.385 --> 12:43.304
acting in ways
we can't perceive.

12:43.387 --> 12:44.847
Are we alone
in the universe?

12:44.930 --> 12:46.724
Impossible, when you
consider the wonders

12:46.807 --> 12:48.184
that exist around us.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.685
...voodoo priests of Haiti,

12:49.769 --> 12:51.937
the Tibetan numerologists
of Appalachia,

12:52.021 --> 12:55.566
the unsolved mysteries
of "Unsolved Mysteries."

12:55.649 --> 12:57.735
The truth is out there.

12:57.818 --> 13:01.155
(Moe grunting)

13:01.238 --> 13:04.033
Who would have thought
a whale could be so heavy?

13:04.116 --> 13:06.327
(gasps)
Cheese it. The Feds.

13:06.410 --> 13:08.204
(whale vocalizes)

13:08.287 --> 13:10.539
Oh, Marge,
I've never felt so alone.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.666
No one believes me.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.628
Uh, this is the part where
you're supposed to say

13:15.711 --> 13:16.796
"I believe you, Homer."

13:16.879 --> 13:18.422
I don't believe
you, Homer.

13:18.506 --> 13:22.051
You do? Oh, Marge,
you've made me so happy.

13:22.134 --> 13:24.178
Mmm, you're not listening.

13:24.261 --> 13:26.222
You're only hearing
what you want to hear.

13:26.305 --> 13:28.557
Thanks. I'd love
an omelet right about now.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.644
Homer, please,
I try to be supportive,

13:31.727 --> 13:33.646
but this has gone too far.

13:33.729 --> 13:36.023
Please just let it be.

13:36.106 --> 13:38.484
No, I can't.
This is my cause.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.236
I'm like the man who
singlehandedly built the rocket

13:40.319 --> 13:41.695
and went to the moon.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.656
What was his name,
Apollo Creed?

13:43.739 --> 13:45.825
Please, let's
just go to sleep.

13:45.908 --> 13:49.620
No, I refuse to share a bed
with someone who thinks I'm crazy.

13:49.703 --> 13:52.248
Unless you're feeling amorous.

13:52.331 --> 13:53.999
-(purrs)
-No, I'm not.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.835
Well, then, good night.

13:55.918 --> 13:59.255
Hey, Dad, what's the word
from planet crackpot?

13:59.338 --> 14:01.590
Oh, I suppose
you're going to mock me too.

14:01.674 --> 14:04.301
Well, actually, Dad,
I believe you.

14:04.385 --> 14:06.387
-You do?
-Yes, I do.

14:06.470 --> 14:08.138
You seem so damn sure.

14:08.222 --> 14:09.598
Thank you, son.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.433
And do you think you could
stop the casual swearing?

14:11.517 --> 14:13.352
-Hell, yes.
-That's my boy.

14:13.435 --> 14:14.603
Well, if you
believe in me

14:14.687 --> 14:15.938
then I'm not
going to give up.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.356
I'll prove I'm right.

14:17.439 --> 14:19.191
This Friday we're
going back to the woods

14:19.275 --> 14:21.151
and we're going
to find that alien.

14:21.235 --> 14:22.486
What if we don't?

14:22.570 --> 14:25.114
We'll fake it and sell
it to the Fox network.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.992
(chuckles)
They'll buy anything.

14:28.075 --> 14:31.203
Now, son, they do a lot
of quality programming too.

14:32.246 --> 14:34.331

14:37.459 --> 14:38.377
I kill me.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.089
-Bud...

14:42.172 --> 14:43.424
er.

14:43.507 --> 14:44.633
-Bud...

14:44.717 --> 14:45.634

14:45.718 --> 14:46.969
Coors.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.763
Yo, Dad, can I have a sip
of your beer?

14:49.847 --> 14:51.849
Now, son, you don't
want to drink beer.

14:51.932 --> 14:54.602
That's for daddies
and kids with fake I.D.s.

14:54.685 --> 14:57.187
Besides, it's such
a beautiful night.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.273
How about a ghost story?

14:59.356 --> 15:03.652
...and that is how much
college will cost for Maggie.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.405
No. No! No!

15:09.158 --> 15:10.534
You know, Dad,

15:10.618 --> 15:12.578
it doesn't matter that
we didn't see the alien.

15:12.661 --> 15:14.121
I really had
a great time out here.

15:14.204 --> 15:16.415
Yeah, me too.

15:16.498 --> 15:18.751
-("The X-Files Theme" playing)
-(gasps) It's him!

15:25.132 --> 15:27.092
I bring you peace.

15:29.386 --> 15:31.263
As a representative
of planet Earth,

15:31.347 --> 15:33.432
let me be the first to say--

15:33.515 --> 15:35.351
(screaming)

15:37.311 --> 15:38.729
(gasps)

15:39.897 --> 15:41.732
D'oh! It's gone.

15:41.815 --> 15:43.901
And we still
don't have any proof.

15:43.984 --> 15:44.985
Oh, yes, we do.

15:45.069 --> 15:46.987
I got it all on tape.

15:47.071 --> 15:48.238
Good work, son!

15:48.322 --> 15:51.575
We did it!
We did it!

15:53.369 --> 15:56.330
And so, from this
simple man came the proof

15:56.413 --> 15:58.999
that we are not alone
in the universe.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.417
I'm Leonard Nimoy.

16:00.501 --> 16:01.961
Good night.

16:02.044 --> 16:05.798
MAN: Uh, Mr. Nimoy, we
have ten minutes left.

16:05.881 --> 16:07.841
Oh... fine.

16:07.925 --> 16:13.222
Well, let me just get,
uh, something out of my car.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.182
(footsteps running)

16:15.265 --> 16:17.476
(tires screeching)

16:19.269 --> 16:21.397
I don't think
he's coming back.

17:16.952 --> 17:19.413
Well, Lis, what do you
think about the alien now?

17:19.496 --> 17:21.665
I think there must be a
more logical explanation

17:21.749 --> 17:24.209
and I think the people of this town
aren't going to be won over

17:24.293 --> 17:26.503
by three seconds
of videotape.

17:26.587 --> 17:27.713
(doorbell rings)

17:29.631 --> 17:32.509
Uh... I'm happy to
answer any questions

17:32.593 --> 17:34.762
you have about the alien.
Any questions at all.

17:34.845 --> 17:36.388
Dr. Hibbert?

17:36.472 --> 17:39.475
Yes, is the alien carbon-based
or silicon-based?

17:39.558 --> 17:41.894
Uh... the second one.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.520
Zilliphone.
Next question.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.856
Is the alien Santa Claus?

17:45.939 --> 17:47.149
Uh... yes.

17:47.232 --> 17:49.318
Uh, were you on my roof
last night

17:49.401 --> 17:51.403

17:51.487 --> 17:52.780
This interview is over.

17:55.365 --> 17:58.827
I remember another gentle
visitor from the heavens.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.080
He came in peace,
and then died,

18:01.163 --> 18:04.083
only to
come back to life.

18:04.166 --> 18:06.210
And his name was...

18:06.293 --> 18:09.088
E.T., the extraterrestrial.

18:09.171 --> 18:12.257
(sniffling)
I loved that little guy.

18:16.720 --> 18:17.721

18:21.683 --> 18:24.436
Leonard Nimoy,
what are you doing here?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.897
Wherever there is mystery
and the unexplained,

18:26.980 --> 18:30.275
-cosmic forces shall draw me near.
-Uh-huh.

18:30.359 --> 18:31.944
Hey, Spock, what do you
want on your hot dog?

18:32.027 --> 18:33.403
Surprise me.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.658

18:46.834 --> 18:49.044
These shirts are a
hundred percent cotton

18:49.128 --> 18:52.172
and look at the fine

18:52.256 --> 18:53.632

I doubted you.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.487
