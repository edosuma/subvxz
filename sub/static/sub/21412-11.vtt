12:12.899 --> 12:14.455
Great idea.

12:14.515 --> 12:17.876
It uses the radiation to stimulate

if we encase the crystal

12:40.452 --> 12:43.094

12:43.188 --> 12:45.454
it will cease to exert influence.

She's saying if we get

12:48.376 --> 12:49.626
everything
goes back to normal.

12:49.734 --> 12:52.751

valuable equipment.

13:06.665 --> 13:08.977
Can't you just walk
like a normal person?

13:09.110 --> 13:12.321
I'm Spider-Man.
It's what I do.

13:12.850 --> 13:14.386
Fine.

13:14.938 --> 13:17.657
You know, if you weren't
so angry at me all the time,

13:17.782 --> 13:19.700
I think we could
actually be friends.

13:19.758 --> 13:21.594
I already have friends,
thanks.

13:21.751 --> 13:23.813
I'm not surprised.
You obviously have

13:23.883 --> 13:26.923
a winning personality.
Look, I'm a little annoyed,

13:27.024 --> 13:29.048
because the whole reason
I came to this stupid

13:29.106 --> 13:30.810
party was to hang out
with my best friend,

13:30.868 --> 13:33.501
but he couldn't make it,
and then all this happened.

13:33.790 --> 13:36.876
I'm sure he has
a solid excuse.

13:37.032 --> 13:38.727
He always does.

13:39.712 --> 13:43.594
It's just that Halloween's
always been our holiday.

13:43.876 --> 13:48.501
We dress up. It's the only day
I don't have to be... Harry Osborn.

13:48.798 --> 13:52.099
Hey, being the son of Norman
Osborn doesn't seem so bad.

13:52.157 --> 13:53.813
That's exactly
the problem.

13:53.993 --> 13:56.743
Everybody sees me
as Norman Osborn's son.

13:56.962 --> 14:00.883
But Peter is the only one
who sees me as... me.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.212
I had no idea.

14:02.352 --> 14:03.533
Why would you?

14:03.743 --> 14:05.402
We got a hit!

14:07.024 --> 14:09.829
What's taking so long?
Ugh!

14:09.946 --> 14:12.946
Your natural gamma radiation is
interfering with the tracker.

14:13.079 --> 14:15.312
I have to filter it out.
What wavelength are you at?

14:15.379 --> 14:17.249
Say what?
Come on!

14:17.316 --> 14:19.240
You were on
the Nobel Prize shortlist.

14:19.298 --> 14:20.673
That was the other guy.

14:20.798 --> 14:23.221
You two literally
share a brain.

14:23.288 --> 14:26.298
The information's gotta be in
there somewhere. Just think.

14:27.735 --> 14:29.829
Vault won't hold forever!

14:34.242 --> 14:35.399
Huh?

14:36.165 --> 14:38.883
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold up, big guy!

14:39.024 --> 14:41.204
It's us!
We tracked a gamma reading.

14:41.399 --> 14:43.048
But I guess it's just you.

14:43.227 --> 14:45.555
No! Wait!
It's not him.

14:45.613 --> 14:46.821
The reading is coming from...

14:50.649 --> 14:51.848
Aahh!

14:54.071 --> 14:55.719
Spidey, heads up!

15:01.047 --> 15:03.314
Mind if I borrow this?

15:07.277 --> 15:09.097
Done and done.

15:17.994 --> 15:20.329
You... You saved me.

15:25.069 --> 15:26.903
Who's gonna save us?

15:27.722 --> 15:29.688
Hulk? Buddy?

15:30.214 --> 15:33.160
You wouldn't wolf out on a
fellow here, now, would ya?

15:48.440 --> 15:51.636
So much for everything
going back to normal.

15:54.428 --> 15:55.839
New strategy:

15:56.535 --> 15:58.014
run!

16:06.183 --> 16:07.863
The scratches from the
Man-Wolf must not

16:07.921 --> 16:09.636
be the only thing that
transformed them.

16:09.720 --> 16:12.079
Maybe it's a combo of the
scratches and

16:12.137 --> 16:13.751
gamma rays
from the lunar crystal.

16:13.816 --> 16:17.025
Yes! The changes need
a gamma source to sustain them.

16:17.094 --> 16:19.704
You contained the crystal,
but Hulk is different.

16:19.954 --> 16:21.970
His body generates
its own gamma rays.

16:22.079 --> 16:24.931
So the Hulk's body is
acting as its own lunar crystal,

16:25.118 --> 16:28.712
fueling not only the Hulk but
the other werewolves as well?

16:29.648 --> 16:31.595
That's why they
haven't change back!

16:31.653 --> 16:33.056
This keeps getting better.

16:33.114 --> 16:36.900
Hulk! Banner!
Try to take control!

16:53.246 --> 16:55.612
Hey, taught you a new trick.

16:59.355 --> 17:01.144
This is all my fault.

17:05.402 --> 17:07.349
Nice doggy!

17:12.282 --> 17:14.941
All right. Let's find some
other way to stop them.

17:15.576 --> 17:18.127
Yeah? Any idea how?

17:19.308 --> 17:21.476
You're scientists.
This is a lab.

17:21.614 --> 17:23.448
What more could you want?

17:27.339 --> 17:29.544
He's right.
Search around.

17:34.646 --> 17:35.818
Hi, guys.

17:35.982 --> 17:38.393
Let me guess. You're just
here for a quick bite.

17:38.451 --> 17:40.396
I should be writing
these jokes down.

17:42.014 --> 17:44.294
Eat water cannon,
fuzz ball!

17:44.387 --> 17:47.302
Although technically, it should
be "drink water cannon."

17:47.427 --> 17:48.841
I'm new at this.

17:50.789 --> 17:54.124
Air concussion! Ha!
I can't believe that worked.

17:54.302 --> 17:57.138
How about some
amped-up pilot burner?

18:00.818 --> 18:02.162
You guys did it!

18:02.310 --> 18:05.508
Science rules!
Take it away, team!

18:13.085 --> 18:15.018
We just
knocked back the Hulk!

18:15.170 --> 18:17.513
Gwen, crystal me!

18:20.474 --> 18:24.350
All right. Let's see if we
can get our gamma train on.

18:26.698 --> 18:27.698
It's working!

18:27.810 --> 18:29.646
What about the others?

18:32.591 --> 18:35.038
Should've worked on them.

18:35.255 --> 18:36.552
Keep going!

18:36.669 --> 18:38.591
I thought you hated
puny Banner.

18:38.664 --> 18:40.982
Sometimes you need puny.

18:42.114 --> 18:43.138
Hulk's right.

18:43.196 --> 18:45.114
As long as he's
giving off gamma rays,

18:45.172 --> 18:47.072
the kids won't
turn back completely.

18:47.184 --> 18:48.904
We need him puny!

19:00.968 --> 19:04.326
Good to see you again, Doctor.
The other guy says hello.

19:04.544 --> 19:07.060
Perfect.
Once the scratches heal,

19:07.130 --> 19:10.255
they'll no longer be susceptible
to gamma transformations.

19:11.060 --> 19:12.287
You did it, Spider-Man.

19:12.365 --> 19:14.599
Great.
Now let's get you both shirts.

19:18.576 --> 19:22.052
It's hard to explain,
but they were werewolves, and...

19:22.169 --> 19:24.089
We're EMT's in New York.

19:24.156 --> 19:26.404
We're used to weird calls
on Halloween.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.232
So, what do we do
with the crystal?

19:30.623 --> 19:33.591
This was my fault,
and I can fix it.

19:33.817 --> 19:37.966
I have the proper materials at my lab to
depower this gem and destroy it forever.

19:38.068 --> 19:41.271
And we should just trust that you
won't mess this up again, why?

19:41.338 --> 19:43.708
No, it's true.
He made a whole protocol

19:43.775 --> 19:45.732
for disposing of it
in case things went wrong.

19:45.909 --> 19:47.544
It's safe with him now.

19:51.607 --> 19:54.615
I never remember my time
as Hulk very clearly,

19:55.036 --> 19:57.318
but I imagine
if it weren't for you,

19:57.513 --> 19:59.857
tonight would've gone
very badly.

20:00.170 --> 20:01.490
Thank you.

20:01.640 --> 20:04.927
I wanna thank you too.
I'm still new at this,

20:04.996 --> 20:08.064
and splitting my time between
my identity as a civilian

20:08.310 --> 20:10.833
and my identity as a superhero
isn't easy.

20:11.022 --> 20:14.927
Spending time around someone...
Well, two someones...

20:15.018 --> 20:17.716
with the same problem
has helped me feel less alone.

20:18.474 --> 20:20.560
Maybe it's time for that selfie.

20:23.990 --> 20:26.044
Mr. Osborn? Sir?

20:27.341 --> 20:30.888
The lunar crystals field test worked
better than could've been imagined.

20:31.387 --> 20:33.059
So I can see.

20:33.349 --> 20:36.482
But I instructed you
not to get my son involved.

20:36.685 --> 20:38.928
That was the whole point
of having you test it alone.

20:38.995 --> 20:40.615
I know, sir.

20:40.829 --> 20:44.740
But as the Man-Wolf,
I had conflicting instincts.

20:44.988 --> 20:46.560
It was problematic.

20:46.787 --> 20:50.302
So, there are issues
of mental control.

20:50.858 --> 20:52.858
But once
we overcome them,

20:53.333 --> 20:56.513
the power of the crystal
will be nearly limitless.

20:57.404 --> 21:00.708
It's true! I turned
into a real werewolf!

21:00.844 --> 21:03.442
Talk about crying wolf.
For serious!

21:03.505 --> 21:06.122
I was locked in a vault,
and the Hulk was there, and...

21:06.189 --> 21:08.358
Eh, sure!
You are such a liar!

21:08.425 --> 21:10.824
Come on!
Is he for real?

21:11.121 --> 21:13.246
- Sounds terrifying.
- Actually,

21:13.363 --> 21:15.988
now that it's over,
it was kind of awesome!

21:16.046 --> 21:19.746
I mean... pfft...
Hulk-Wolf! Come on!

21:23.199 --> 21:25.090
Thanks for warning me
to stay away.

21:25.348 --> 21:28.113
Although I'm sorry we didn't get
to hang at the Halloween party.

21:28.246 --> 21:31.614
That's okay, Pete. Our friendship
trumps Halloween any day.

21:31.761 --> 21:35.183
- Why's that?
- No reason to ever wear a mask.
