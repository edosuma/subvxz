08:07.500 --> 08:09.208
the Mighty Quad Squad.

08:09.250 --> 08:11.625
Aw, don't think of it

08:09.250 --> 08:11.625
as splitting up the Mighty Quad

08:09.250 --> 08:11.625

08:11.667 --> 08:13.625
Think of it

08:11.667 --> 08:13.625
as a heroic gesture

Gives the people

08:15.417 --> 08:17.208

For example,

08:17.250 --> 08:20.500
they want our costumes,

08:20.542 --> 08:24.917
and they don't want yours.

Okay.

Nicky, you can let

09:06.792 --> 09:09.208
go of the sign now.

09:09.250 --> 09:10.583
No, I can't.

09:17.250 --> 09:19.792
had that giant inflatable slice

09:17.250 --> 09:19.792
for you to land on.

I can't even

09:38.375 --> 09:40.250
hold a sign right.

There he is.

09:54.875 --> 09:57.834
It's Flying Goggle Boy.

You're the most powerful

09:57.875 --> 10:00.709
of the Mighty Quad Squad.

Can I have your autograph?

Really?

Yeah, we saw you fly!

10:07.208 --> 10:09.375
What was it like?

10:09.417 --> 10:13.417
Well, it was

10:09.417 --> 10:13.417
quite an adventure.

10:13.458 --> 10:16.333
I was walking my usual beat

10:13.458 --> 10:16.333
outside the store,

10:16.375 --> 10:19.125
when a cold North wind

10:16.375 --> 10:19.125
blew up and filled my cape,

10:19.166 --> 10:21.625
sending me high up into the air.

10:21.667 --> 10:24.959
I rode that angry wind

10:21.667 --> 10:24.959
like a bucking bronco,

10:25.000 --> 10:28.125
flying higher than any boy

10:25.000 --> 10:28.125
has ever flown.

Once I tamed

10:28.166 --> 10:30.583
that blustery beast,

10:30.625 --> 10:32.375
I high-fived the moon,

10:32.417 --> 10:34.083
fist-bumped the sun,

10:34.125 --> 10:38.166
then satisfied

10:34.125 --> 10:38.166
my superhero-sized appetite

10:38.208 --> 10:42.583

Please don't.

11:13.125 --> 11:14.625
I beg your pardon.

11:14.667 --> 11:17.041
You had some schmutz

11:14.667 --> 11:17.041
on your elbow

11:17.083 --> 11:18.583
that could only be removed

14:53.375 --> 14:54.750
Nope.

14:54.792 --> 14:56.834
[upbeat music]

14:56.875 --> 15:00.166
See, this heavy-duty fishing

14:56.875 --> 15:00.166
line is attached to this sign.

15:00.208 --> 15:01.250
See?

15:01.291 --> 15:03.250
And then it runs

15:01.291 --> 15:03.250
through this pulley

15:03.291 --> 15:04.834
that'll be attached

15:03.291 --> 15:04.834
to the ceiling.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.875
So, when you grab the sign,

15:06.917 --> 15:11.458
that's my cue to reel it in

15:06.917 --> 15:11.458
and make Goggle Boy fly.

15:11.500 --> 15:13.041
I like it,

15:13.083 --> 15:16.208
but is there a way to do it

15:13.083 --> 15:16.208
without the fishing line?

15:16.250 --> 15:19.417
You know,

15:16.250 --> 15:19.417
really make me fly?

15:20.750 --> 15:23.667
Um, unfortunately no.

15:23.709 --> 15:26.417
But the fog will

15:23.709 --> 15:26.417
cover the fishing line,

15:26.458 --> 15:28.667
so it will look

15:26.458 --> 15:28.667
like you're actually flying.

15:28.709 --> 15:32.917
Hmm, that's good for now,

15:28.709 --> 15:32.917
but in the future

15:32.959 --> 15:36.125
let's look into

15:32.959 --> 15:36.125
the real flying thing.
