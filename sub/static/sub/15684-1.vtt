00:30.999 --> 00:31.999
The living...

00:32.999 --> 00:36.899
An endless chorus of voicesfrom
the beginning to the end.

00:37.099 --> 00:40.999
But if a voice is silencedand
the killer is never caught,

00:41.199 --> 00:44.499
the dead continue to wail.

00:44.699 --> 00:47.999
Their cry goes unheard.

00:49.999 --> 00:54.799
The slayer lives on,day follows day.

00:54.999 --> 01:01.999
And eventually,
whenthe killer realizes thatno one is coming,

01:02.199 --> 01:05.999
he must feelhe has cheated the gods.

01:06.999 --> 01:08.799
But the old gods...

01:08.999 --> 01:11.399
...are vengeful creatures.

01:11.599 --> 01:13.999
There are three sisters.

01:17.999 --> 01:22.399
They were trusted to
keeptheir beautiful friend

01:22.599 --> 01:26.999
persephone far from Hades,
lord of the underworld.

01:27.199 --> 01:31.999
All they had to dowas stay together.

01:32.199 --> 01:35.999
Why can't they do it?Jealousy?

01:36.199 --> 01:39.999
Brought by the lure of a voice?

01:44.999 --> 01:48.999
So the sistersabandoned persephone.

01:49.375 --> 01:55.999
Then Hades dragged her
downinto the land of the dead.

01:56.667 --> 01:59.792
The gods,in their rage and fury,

01:59.999 --> 02:04.799
transformed the sisters into
themonstrous and ravenous sirens

02:04.999 --> 02:10.999
and banished themacross the seas,
cursing themto remain there together...

02:11.199 --> 02:17.167
...for all eternity,
singing thedead's song of vengeance.

02:30.999 --> 02:31.999
Are you even watching?

02:32.199 --> 02:32.799
Yeah, yeah.

02:32.999 --> 02:34.876
Can you pass me the other one?

02:38.999 --> 02:39.799
Oh.

02:39.999 --> 02:40.999
Oh, my God.

02:42.999 --> 02:46.999
There you go again, huh?
Throwing my heart on the floor.

02:51.999 --> 02:53.999
I don't know why I said that.
That was stupid.

02:58.999 --> 03:04.999
No. I'm sorry.I just wish it didn't happen.

03:06.999 --> 03:08.999
It's my fault. Come here.

03:10.999 --> 03:12.999
So focused and...

03:13.999 --> 03:17.999
...so wrapped up in my career,
I forgot what was important.

03:18.199 --> 03:19.799
I should have stuck by you, Dan.

03:19.999 --> 03:21.799
I should never have walked outon you.

03:21.999 --> 03:24.999
It's this place, you know,
it sucks the life out of us.

03:25.199 --> 03:26.999
It puts so much pressure on us.

03:27.199 --> 03:27.799
It's getting better.

03:27.999 --> 03:31.459
Soon we'll have a new
sous-chefin the kitchen and...

03:33.999 --> 03:35.999
...maybe in a few yearswe'll have some kids,
huh?

03:37.999 --> 03:38.999
Get them on pot washing.

03:50.999 --> 03:54.999
You never said you wanted kids.
Are you serious?

03:55.199 --> 03:57.499
I guess I'm growing up.

03:57.699 --> 03:59.999
I guess you are.

04:05.999 --> 04:06.999
So, what are we gonna doabout this, eh?

04:08.999 --> 04:09.999
I don't know.

04:10.999 --> 04:11.999
Dust it off, it'll be fine.

04:12.999 --> 04:13.799
I'm kidding.

04:13.999 --> 04:16.999
- Yeah.
- Stick it in the bin.

04:17.199 --> 04:17.798
Gladly.

04:17.999 --> 04:18.999
Get me another one.

06:09.999 --> 06:12.999
Daniel?

06:13.999 --> 06:14.999
Daniel?

06:16.999 --> 06:18.999
You're in the hospital.

06:20.999 --> 06:21.999
How are you feeling?

06:22.999 --> 06:25.751
You've been in a comafor three days.

06:27.999 --> 06:28.999
Can you hear me?

06:30.999 --> 06:32.799
The police will needto
ask you some questions.

06:32.999 --> 06:35.999
You've sufferedsevere head trauma...
attack...

06:36.199 --> 06:36.799
Severe injuries.

06:36.999 --> 06:39.999
Injuries...Trauma, trauma...

07:59.999 --> 08:01.999
* I cannot feel

08:03.999 --> 08:06.999
*...In my lifethings seem surreal *

08:09.999 --> 08:16.999
*...Take a dropthen roll the dice,
all my dreams on paradise *

08:20.999 --> 08:22.999
Dan?

08:23.125 --> 08:24.799
Daniel?

08:24.999 --> 08:25.999
Are you even listening to me?

08:26.999 --> 08:27.999
Yeah.

08:29.999 --> 08:31.799
I don't know whether
you'retaking the piss or not.

08:31.999 --> 08:37.999
- You expect me to funda four-month
tour of europeanvegetarian restaurants.

08:38.198 --> 08:39.799
I know you've hada tough year this year,

08:39.999 --> 08:44.999
but you've been back six months,
you're my top food writer,

08:45.199 --> 08:46.799
and yet all you producedsince
you've been back,

08:46.999 --> 08:50.999
is a pile of crapabout veggie
restaurantsand bloody tofu burgers.

08:51.199 --> 08:54.799
- You're makinga fool out of me, Dan.

08:54.999 --> 08:57.999
Don't make me show youthe readers' letters.

08:58.199 --> 09:00.799
It's obviousyou had some troubles.

09:00.999 --> 09:04.799
You got no memory of that week.
Who wouldn't be messed upfrom that?

09:04.999 --> 09:10.999
If the police were gonna findthe guys that
killed Annie,they'd have done it by now.

09:11.199 --> 09:14.799
You've got to find closuresomehow.

09:14.999 --> 09:17.999
Because if you don't,your life's screwed.

09:18.199 --> 09:19.999
Believe me,I want closure, Mike.

09:20.999 --> 09:25.999
I'm trying to be supportive.
I really am. But...

09:26.199 --> 09:26.799
But?

09:26.999 --> 09:29.999
But this magazinecosts
a lot of money to run.

09:30.999 --> 09:32.999
Okay, Mike.

09:33.999 --> 09:34.999
Dan.

09:35.999 --> 09:37.999
Write me somethingcarnivore-friendly.

09:38.199 --> 09:39.499
- Please.

09:39.699 --> 09:40.999
Okay, Mike.

09:53.999 --> 09:55.999
So? What do you think?

09:56.999 --> 09:59.999
Uh, if I'm honest mate,
it looks exactly the same.

10:00.199 --> 10:02.999
- Oh, if it's not broken,don't fix it right?

10:03.199 --> 10:03.999
Have you met anybody yet?

10:04.999 --> 10:06.799
I have actually.

10:06.999 --> 10:08.799
I've found a girl,haven't exactly met but...

10:08.999 --> 10:13.999
Hmm. Don't tell me you'rewasting your time
searching forthe love of your life online.

10:14.199 --> 10:18.999
You need some flesh.
You need to bury your facein some titty.

10:19.999 --> 10:20.999
We talk about things, you know?

10:21.999 --> 10:24.999
Yeah. Little eye chat?Little eye wink. Huh?

10:25.999 --> 10:29.999
How well can you knowsomebody
you've never met, man?Seriously?

10:30.199 --> 10:32.999
Yeah, well, how would youever know anybody?

10:34.999 --> 10:36.999
I won't argue that.

10:38.999 --> 10:39.799
So, when are you opening?

10:39.999 --> 10:41.799
Thank God, not for another week.

10:41.999 --> 10:45.999
Still in boxes,the place is a mess,
but we're getting there.

10:46.199 --> 10:46.999
You wanna check the back?

10:47.199 --> 10:47.999

After all, I wouldn't have thisplace

11:01.999 --> 11:05.899

is if you just cameon opening night.

11:06.099 --> 11:09.999
We'll have a good timeand maybe
somebodycould get a review out of it.

11:10.199 --> 11:10.799
That's what this is about?

11:10.999 --> 11:13.999
No, it's not what this is about. I just said,
we'll have some funand, you know...

11:14.199 --> 11:16.999
...maybe I can meetyour virtual girlfriend.

11:20.999 --> 11:21.799
Are you all right?

11:21.999 --> 11:22.999
Are you going to be sick?

11:25.999 --> 11:28.999
No, not, don't do that here.

13:35.999 --> 13:36.799
Hello.

13:36.999 --> 13:39.799
Hi, Victor.

13:39.999 --> 13:40.999
I have a present for you.

13:42.999 --> 13:44.799
Oh, wow.

13:44.999 --> 13:45.799
Yeah.Yeah, that's lovely.

13:45.999 --> 13:48.999
I would loveto see your bedroom.

13:49.999 --> 13:55.999
Um, I thought maybewe could go for a walk,
have a little drink?

13:58.999 --> 14:00.999
But, uh, you invited me over.

14:01.999 --> 14:04.999
I did, yeah. Um...

14:05.999 --> 14:07.799
...I invited you for my sister.

14:07.999 --> 14:10.799
So I get to fuck youand your sister?

14:10.999 --> 14:14.999
She's asked meto keep you
companywhile she prepares for dinner.

14:47.999 --> 14:50.999
Here, give me some of that.

14:51.199 --> 14:51.999
Hold on.

14:52.999 --> 14:53.999
What's that then?

14:54.999 --> 14:57.999
You know, the musemight hit me, you know?

14:58.199 --> 14:58.999
The muse.

15:00.999 --> 15:02.799
Did I say something wrong?

15:02.999 --> 15:04.999
My girlfriendused to call me that.

15:05.199 --> 15:06.999
Her muse.

15:07.999 --> 15:08.999
Bad breakup?

15:09.999 --> 15:10.999
She died.

15:12.999 --> 15:13.999
Oh.

15:15.999 --> 15:16.999
I'm sorry.

15:20.999 --> 15:22.799
How?

15:22.999 --> 15:24.999
It doesn't matter.

15:25.999 --> 15:26.999
Tell me.

15:27.999 --> 15:28.999
You can tell me anything.

15:30.999 --> 15:31.899
I...

15:32.099 --> 15:32.799
Yes?

15:32.999 --> 15:35.399
One day, I came home and...

15:35.599 --> 15:37.999
Hold that thought.

15:42.999 --> 15:44.399
I'll be right back.

15:44.599 --> 15:45.999
Where are you going?

15:46.999 --> 15:49.999
That stuff will knock you out.Wait for me.

15:52.999 --> 15:54.799
Sometimes I wonder...

15:54.999 --> 15:58.999
...if the sirens have
adaptedtoo well to their fate.

15:59.199 --> 16:03.799
Playing with human soulsis dangerous.

16:03.999 --> 16:08.999
Perhaps they've becomea little too quick,
feasting on the guilty,

16:09.199 --> 16:10.999
a little too eagerly.

16:12.999 --> 16:14.999
I've been drinking, bitch.

16:15.199 --> 16:16.799
What's it to you?

16:16.999 --> 16:20.542
Always judging me.
How do you thinkthat makes me feel?

16:20.999 --> 16:21.999
You're nothing!

16:22.199 --> 16:22.999
Nothing!

16:23.999 --> 16:24.799
- Easy.

16:24.999 --> 16:26.999
You make me fucking sick.

16:27.999 --> 16:30.999
I should've run you downa long time ago.

16:31.999 --> 16:34.999
I should've finished you offa lot sooner.

16:35.199 --> 16:35.999
God.

16:52.999 --> 16:54.999
I understandwhat you're going through.

16:55.199 --> 16:56.799
The loss must be so hard.

16:56.999 --> 16:59.999
Well, I don't thinki'll ever get over it.

17:00.199 --> 17:01.999
We're surroundedby awful things.

17:02.999 --> 17:04.999
Yeah.Yeah, I know.

17:45.999 --> 17:47.999
I think I'm falling for you.

17:48.999 --> 17:50.899
I know that might be a...

17:51.099 --> 17:52.799
- No, Callie, please. Um...

17:52.999 --> 17:55.999
I'm glad you said it.I feel the same way.

18:38.999 --> 18:40.999
What?What's the matter?

18:41.199 --> 18:41.799
Nothing.

18:41.999 --> 18:46.999
Listen you deserve to be happy.
Just be yourself.

18:47.199 --> 18:47.999
That's just it though.

18:48.999 --> 18:50.999
I wanna be somebody else.

18:55.999 --> 18:58.999
I mean, I wish I could go backand
just do it differently,you know?

18:59.199 --> 19:00.799
- Me too.
- Really?

19:00.999 --> 19:06.999
I mean you live onsome idyllic little island,
running your own hotel.

19:07.199 --> 19:08.999
Things aren't alwaysas they seem.

19:09.999 --> 19:12.999
I would leave if I could.

19:14.999 --> 19:16.999
Callie? Everything all right?

19:26.999 --> 19:28.999
Ahh! Fuck!

19:37.999 --> 19:38.999
Bitch.

19:46.999 --> 19:48.999
No!

19:56.999 --> 19:57.799
I've got to go.

19:57.999 --> 19:59.999
Callie, what's going on?I heard a scream.

20:00.199 --> 20:00.999
Are you okay?Callie?

20:01.999 --> 20:02.999
Callie?

20:06.999 --> 20:07.999
Shit.

20:10.999 --> 20:12.999
Pick up, pick up.

20:14.999 --> 20:17.999
You've reached my answer phone.
Please leave a message.

20:18.199 --> 20:18.999
Shit.

20:55.999 --> 20:58.999
All right, Ryan.
I'll be over tomorrowfor the review.

21:10.999 --> 21:13.999
It's me again.You let me know you're okay.

21:17.999 --> 21:18.899
Any luck?

21:19.099 --> 21:19.999
Nothing.

21:21.999 --> 21:23.626
Do you think she dumped you?

21:24.999 --> 21:25.799
Nah.

21:25.999 --> 21:27.999
It was going well.

21:28.999 --> 21:30.999
I heard a scream.

21:31.999 --> 21:32.999
Dan...

21:33.999 --> 21:35.799
...let it go man.

21:35.999 --> 21:40.999
All right? You've got a job to focus on,
I have a job to focus on, so...

21:41.199 --> 21:42.999
...can we get on with this?
- Yeah.

21:43.199 --> 21:43.999
I'd like my review.

21:44.999 --> 21:47.999
Ah. You're going to love this.

21:48.199 --> 21:48.999
It's a fresh parma ham...

21:50.999 --> 21:54.999
...and a lovely creamcheese en croute,
with abeautiful virgin olive oil.

21:55.199 --> 21:56.999
Simple and clean.It's one of my favorites.

21:58.999 --> 21:59.999
Aren't you gonna have to try it?

22:00.999 --> 22:02.999
I should've called the police.

22:04.959 --> 22:05.999
And say what?

22:06.999 --> 22:08.999
My virtual girlfriendis not calling me back?

22:09.199 --> 22:10.799
What if something'shappened to her?

22:10.999 --> 22:13.999
Then I'm surethe police would
havetaken care of it by now.

22:14.199 --> 22:14.999
Yeah.

22:16.999 --> 22:20.999
All right. Forget that.
This is great, I know.

22:21.199 --> 22:21.999
Now to the main course...

22:22.199 --> 22:22.799
What is it?

22:22.999 --> 22:28.999
Ah. Your favorite,a filet mignon.
Sink your teeth into that.

22:33.999 --> 22:35.999
This is supposed to be funny?

22:37.999 --> 22:38.799
What?

22:38.999 --> 22:40.999
This was Annie's signature dish.

22:41.999 --> 22:42.799
Dan, it's my signature dish.

22:42.999 --> 22:44.999
Ryan, I'm not doing thiswith you right now.

22:45.199 --> 22:45.799
But...

22:45.999 --> 22:48.799
You really are a piece of work.

22:48.999 --> 22:52.999
Dan, come on man.Just sit down and try it.
Okay?Dan come on.

22:53.199 --> 22:53.799
You're a piece of shit man.

22:53.999 --> 22:58.999
Dan, I wouldn't do that to you.
Don't leave like this.

23:14.999 --> 23:18.999
*damsel in distress...

23:20.999 --> 23:23.999
*...She needs a hero...

23:24.999 --> 23:31.999
*...To shield her pretty eyes,
because these are thingsshe shouldn't see *

23:34.999 --> 23:37.999
* well, you might fool them

23:38.999 --> 23:41.999
*but you don't fool me

23:42.999 --> 23:47.799
*because she likes the drama,
but she'll turn her head...*

23:47.999 --> 23:55.042
*...But she don't look away,just watches
instead,but she likes the violence*

23:55.999 --> 24:02.999
* and the excitement,as punches are thrown,
when your cover is blown *

24:12.999 --> 24:17.399
*damsel in distress...

24:17.599 --> 24:21.999
*...She needs a hero...

24:22.999 --> 24:25.799
*...To shieldher pretty eyes...*

24:25.999 --> 24:30.999
*...Because these are
thingsshe shouldn't see...*

24:32.999 --> 24:39.999
*and she walks away,reluctantly*

24:41.999 --> 24:46.999
*because she likes the drama,
but she don't turn her head,*

24:47.199 --> 24:51.999
*but she don't look away,
just watches instead,*

24:52.199 --> 24:56.999
*but she likes the
violenceand the excitement,*

24:57.199 --> 25:01.999
*as punches are thrown,
when your cover is blown.*

25:14.999 --> 25:16.999
I haven't seen youon the island before,
have I?

25:17.199 --> 25:17.799
No.

25:17.999 --> 25:20.999
- It's only the hotel
thatbrings people there now.

25:21.199 --> 25:22.999
- My girlfriendworks out there, Tess.

25:23.199 --> 25:25.999
- She can be fiery though.

25:26.199 --> 25:26.999
- Jerky?

25:28.999 --> 25:30.999
No. No, no, no.I'm good. Thanks.

25:31.199 --> 25:31.999
Hmm, suit yourself.

25:38.999 --> 25:41.899
Sometimes I wonder if the sirens

25:42.099 --> 25:45.949
have adapted too wellto their fate.

25:46.149 --> 25:49.799
Playing with human soulsis dangerous.

25:49.999 --> 25:53.999
Perhaps they become a littletoo
quick with their knives,

25:54.199 --> 25:58.999
feasting on the guilty,a little too eagerly.

25:59.199 --> 26:01.999
A safe arrival.

26:02.999 --> 26:04.999
If when you need a rideback into town.

26:05.199 --> 26:06.999
Oh, thanks.

26:07.199 --> 26:08.799
It's leather.

26:08.999 --> 26:11.999
It's local made.That'll be 19.50.

26:23.999 --> 26:26.999
Thank you. Keep the change.
- Oh, thank you.

26:27.199 --> 26:28.999
I told you not Togo snooping down there.

26:29.876 --> 26:31.999
- Ow! I'm sorry, Tess.

26:37.999 --> 26:40.999
Welcome to the inn.You're Danny, aren't you?

26:41.199 --> 26:41.999
Just Dan.

26:47.999 --> 26:48.999
Is Callie around?

26:50.999 --> 26:53.999
Someone shouldprobably intervene.

26:54.199 --> 26:55.999
Not me. I observe.

26:57.999 --> 26:58.999
Where is she?

27:00.999 --> 27:04.999
This is a task for heroes.

27:06.999 --> 27:10.999
But I don't thinkwe're going
to findany on this island,

27:11.199 --> 27:12.999
just heartsick fools.

27:16.999 --> 27:16.999
Hi.

27:17.999 --> 27:18.799
Can I help you?

27:18.999 --> 27:20.999
Yeah.Um, I'm looking for Callie.

27:21.199 --> 27:23.799
Oh, you must be Daniel.

27:23.999 --> 27:27.999
She's told meabsolutely nothing about you.
You're a total secret.

27:28.199 --> 27:29.999
But a very handsome secret,nonetheless.

27:31.999 --> 27:32.799
Uh, and you are?

27:32.999 --> 27:34.999
Lydia. Her older sister.

27:35.199 --> 27:35.799
Oh...

27:35.999 --> 27:38.799
Callie didn't mentionshe had a sister.

27:38.999 --> 27:42.399
Seems like you're infor
a very educational visit.

27:42.599 --> 27:45.999
I see you've alreadyhad the
pleasureof meeting Tess.

27:46.199 --> 27:48.499
Oh, I wouldn't exactlycall that a pleasure.

27:48.699 --> 27:50.999
You know she's the youngestof us three.

27:57.375 --> 27:58.799
Um, so, you...

27:58.999 --> 28:02.999
so is Callie around?
Because she's beenexpecting me, so.

28:04.999 --> 28:08.999
- Callie, can you come herea moment please?
I have a surprise for you.

28:15.999 --> 28:16.999
Dan.

28:23.999 --> 28:25.799
Small confession, Daniel.

28:25.999 --> 28:31.999
That text, rescue me,kiss, kiss, I sent it.

28:32.199 --> 28:33.999
- What?
- Text?

28:34.999 --> 28:37.999
I just hadto get you two together.

28:38.199 --> 28:38.999
I'm speechless.

28:39.999 --> 28:41.999
My God. What's going on here?

28:44.999 --> 28:45.999
I've laid a room up for you,daniel.

28:47.999 --> 28:49.799
Oh, you don't have to stay.

28:49.999 --> 28:51.999
What?I can, so, I can stay some...

28:52.199 --> 28:53.999
I think it's a great idea.

28:55.999 --> 28:58.399
I can stay, I guess.

28:58.599 --> 29:00.999
See? He can stay.

29:01.292 --> 29:02.799
But, um...

29:02.999 --> 29:02.999
Go on, Callie.

29:06.999 --> 29:07.999
All right.

29:23.999 --> 29:26.999
I hope my sisters didn'tfreak
you out completely.

29:27.199 --> 29:27.999
Oh, they have.

29:28.999 --> 29:31.524
You never told meyou had sisters.

29:31.724 --> 29:34.250
Are you joking?You just met them.

29:35.999 --> 29:40.501
So, uh, Tess,is she a bit unwell?

29:40.999 --> 29:42.999
I'm sorry Lydia tricked youinto coming here.

29:43.626 --> 29:43.999
Really?

29:46.999 --> 29:48.999
Really. I have no idea why.

29:49.999 --> 29:52.999
Okay.Um, I'll leave tomorrow,I guess.

29:57.999 --> 29:59.999
That's probably best.

30:09.999 --> 30:10.999
So, this is you.

30:12.999 --> 30:15.999
Just get yourself settled in.

30:19.999 --> 30:20.999
Callie?

30:21.999 --> 30:21.999
Yes, Dan?

30:23.999 --> 30:23.999
What's up?

30:26.999 --> 30:28.799
I mean, seriously.

30:28.999 --> 30:30.399
I wasn't expecting this.

30:30.599 --> 30:31.799
I don't know what to say...

30:31.999 --> 30:34.999
I heard a screamand nothing for two days.

30:36.999 --> 30:39.999
And now this?"Here's your room,
I hope you settle in?"

30:41.999 --> 30:42.999
All right.

30:43.999 --> 30:47.999
How about you come to minefor dinner tonight,
around the back of the hotel.

30:48.199 --> 30:48.999
And we'll talk?

30:50.999 --> 30:51.999
We'll talk.

30:52.999 --> 30:53.999
Say around 7:00?

30:54.999 --> 30:55.999
It's a date.

31:05.999 --> 31:07.999
It's a date.

31:10.999 --> 31:11.999
Idiot.

31:48.999 --> 31:50.999
I don't know if that'll help.Just try that.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.999
I hate this van. It never works.

31:58.199 --> 31:58.999
You all right there?

32:00.999 --> 32:02.999
I don't suppose you knowanything
about engines, do you?

32:03.199 --> 32:04.799
Sorry.

32:04.999 --> 32:08.999
Me neither.
Our van won't start,so we're a bit stuck.

32:09.999 --> 32:13.999
Well, there are worst placesto be stuck,
I suppose.

32:14.199 --> 32:15.999
Yeah, I've been in most of them.

32:18.999 --> 32:20.999
It's nice here though.

32:22.999 --> 32:23.999
Dan, by the way.

32:26.999 --> 32:28.584
Lennie.

32:28.999 --> 32:31.799
So, uh, you're stayingat the hotel then,
I take it?

32:31.999 --> 32:34.999
Yeah, I'm here with my band.
Well we've been herefor two nights already.

32:35.199 --> 32:36.999
Oh, you've been stuck herefor two days?

32:37.959 --> 32:39.799
It sounds stupid, I know...

32:39.999 --> 32:43.999
...but someone has stolenall of our stuff,
wallets,phones, bag, everything.

32:44.199 --> 32:45.999
So that rules outcalling a mechanic.

32:46.199 --> 32:46.999
That's awful.

32:47.999 --> 32:51.125
Listen, I don't have muchbut
I could lend you something.

32:51.999 --> 32:55.999
No, it's not as bad as it seems.Callie has
offered to put usall up free of charge,

32:56.199 --> 32:57.799
until the van is fixed.Thanks though.

32:57.999 --> 33:00.399
Right, right,
you're a friendof Callie's then?

33:00.599 --> 33:02.999
Yeah,
by having a fewjamming sessions together.

33:03.199 --> 33:03.999
Jamming?

33:04.999 --> 33:05.799
Callie's a musician?

33:05.999 --> 33:08.799
Yeah.She's got an amazing voice.

33:08.999 --> 33:10.999
My brother is totallyin love her, of course.

33:15.999 --> 33:20.999
Right. Um, you don't happen to
knowwhere her cottage is, do you?

33:21.199 --> 33:23.999
Oh, yeah, it's just over there,
and up the Lane.

33:24.999 --> 33:25.999
All right. Thanks for that.

33:26.999 --> 33:27.999
Good luck to you.
- Thank you.

33:54.999 --> 33:55.799
- Hi.
- Hi.

33:55.999 --> 33:57.999
Just about found it.

34:00.999 --> 34:03.999
Huh, nice place.

34:04.199 --> 34:05.799
Thank you.

34:05.999 --> 34:06.999
Can I get your coat?

34:09.998 --> 34:11.998
Yeah.

34:12.998 --> 34:15.998
And...You look beautiful.

34:20.998 --> 34:22.998
Oh, this is nice.

34:23.998 --> 34:24.998
Sit down.

34:43.998 --> 34:44.799
Not bad.

34:44.998 --> 34:45.998
You don't think so.

34:46.998 --> 34:48.998
That was all right.

34:49.998 --> 34:52.899
Fate's been good to us anyway.

34:53.099 --> 34:55.799
You think so? Still stuck here.

34:55.998 --> 34:59.399
Exactly, we need to practiceto
see if wehave to be unplugged.

34:59.599 --> 35:02.999
You know, this isthe most
expensive roomin the whole hotel,

35:03.199 --> 35:03.799
curtesy of Callie.

35:03.999 --> 35:08.999
Look Ethan,I think that ship has sailed.
Her boyfriend's here now.

35:09.199 --> 35:09.799
What do you know?

35:09.999 --> 35:11.999
I know that they're on a date.

35:16.999 --> 35:21.999
Um, so Callie I've,
I thoughtmaybe we could talk, um,

35:22.199 --> 35:23.499
about what happenedbefore you...

35:23.699 --> 35:24.999
Can it not waituntil after dinner?

35:25.999 --> 35:28.999
This is our first timetogether in the flesh,
Dan.

35:29.199 --> 35:29.999
I, kind of, imagine it would be,

35:31.999 --> 35:31.999
I don't know,

35:32.999 --> 35:33.999
romantic.

35:35.999 --> 35:36.999
Okay.

35:38.999 --> 35:40.999
You know,
Callie and danhave nothing in common.

35:41.999 --> 35:42.999
How do you know that?

35:43.999 --> 35:44.999
Callie is a musician.

35:45.999 --> 35:49.999
With a voice like that,she needs an artist.

35:50.199 --> 35:50.999
Someone like me.

35:51.999 --> 35:53.999
Or and actual artist like Jake.

35:54.999 --> 35:57.799
Lydia said Dan's a food critic.

35:57.999 --> 35:59.999
See, he writes about food,you know...

36:00.199 --> 36:01.999
...we write about love.

36:04.999 --> 36:05.799
You can't write a five-starreview like that.

36:05.999 --> 36:08.799
Yeah, no kidding.
We've neverhad a five-star review.

36:08.999 --> 36:14.799
How's it going then?
Tell me what's beenyour best ever gig?

36:14.999 --> 36:21.999
Probably a few days ago,
that seaside place,the gold and admiral.

36:22.199 --> 36:23.999
Right now an audience of seven.

36:24.199 --> 36:24.999
And free chips.

36:25.999 --> 36:27.999
You can't beat free chips.

36:28.999 --> 36:31.799
Well, all right.Then what about before me?

36:31.999 --> 36:34.999
What was your best.No,
what wasyour worst ever gig?

36:41.999 --> 36:44.999
Well, don't keep secrets.I hate it.
I can smell them a mile off.

36:46.999 --> 36:48.999
Before you started the band,

36:50.999 --> 36:51.999
we were incomplete.

36:52.199 --> 36:52.999
Oh.

36:53.999 --> 36:55.999
Yeah, we were really,really shit.

36:57.999 --> 37:01.999
There were no worse gigs.In fact they
were all contendersfor worst gig.

37:04.999 --> 37:06.799
Should we get back on it then?

37:06.999 --> 37:09.799
We don't want to enragethe
rock and roll gods.

37:09.999 --> 37:12.999
We create our own fate.
There's no gods to punish us.

37:13.999 --> 37:18.999
Well, that's lucky, Ethan,
because your last riff was shit.

37:19.999 --> 37:21.999
Come on, bro.

37:29.999 --> 37:33.999
Um, listen, Callie,I'm having a bit of
a problemwith food lately, just meat.

37:34.199 --> 37:37.999
So I don't knowwhat you've prepared
but pleasedon't be offended if I...

37:38.199 --> 37:39.999
I'm practically vegan myselfthese days.

37:41.999 --> 37:42.999
Wow.

37:43.999 --> 37:44.999
Fantastic.

37:49.999 --> 37:50.999
Mmm. Mmmm.

37:52.999 --> 37:53.799
This is really good.

37:53.999 --> 37:56.799
- Yeah?
- Honestly, really good.

37:56.999 --> 37:58.899
Would I get a good reviewin your magazine?

37:59.099 --> 38:00.999
Sure, why not?
If I've still got a job that is.

38:01.199 --> 38:02.799
What do you mean?

38:02.999 --> 38:08.899
Well, turns out the, uh,gastronomical
readership isn'tas veggie-friendly as I'd hoped.

38:09.099 --> 38:14.999
So apparently if I don't
starteating meat again soon, then...

38:16.999 --> 38:18.999
Hmm, what? What is it?

38:19.999 --> 38:21.999
Nothing. It's an animal,that's all.

38:22.999 --> 38:23.999
You don't get much of thatin the big city.

38:24.999 --> 38:26.999
I guess not.

38:28.250 --> 38:29.999
I hated it actually.

38:31.999 --> 38:32.999
So leave.

38:36.999 --> 38:37.999
Leave with me.

38:40.999 --> 38:42.799
I've known you for, like,two hours...

38:42.999 --> 38:45.999
Hey, you've known me for months.
You know everything about me.

38:46.999 --> 38:49.999
I touched youfor the first time today.

38:50.199 --> 38:50.799
Two minutes ago.

38:50.999 --> 38:53.999
Yeah,but we have a connection.

38:54.999 --> 38:55.999
It's rare.

38:57.999 --> 38:59.799
No, my sisters...

38:59.999 --> 39:01.999
Your sisters will get over it.

39:02.199 --> 39:02.999
Hmm.

39:04.999 --> 39:06.999
How about we get to knoweach other?

39:28.999 --> 39:29.999
This is wrong.

39:32.999 --> 39:33.999
What the fuck was that?

39:36.999 --> 39:38.799
I better go out to take a look.

39:38.999 --> 39:40.799
Yeah, here, here,I'll come with you.

39:40.999 --> 39:44.999
This is happening too fast.Stay here,
I'll be right back.

39:45.199 --> 39:45.999
Callie!

39:47.999 --> 39:49.999
Great.

41:37.999 --> 41:38.999
Callie?

41:44.999 --> 41:45.999
Hello?

41:54.999 --> 41:55.999
Hello?

42:02.999 --> 42:03.999
Hello?

42:04.999 --> 42:04.999
Callie?

42:07.999 --> 42:12.799
How life repeats itself,
on a blinded promise...

42:12.999 --> 42:17.899
...ready to fly the nestabandoning
thosethat are near...

42:18.099 --> 42:22.999
...but the gods remain vengeful,
the dead must be avenged.

42:41.999 --> 42:42.999
Hello?

42:44.999 --> 42:45.999
Hello?

42:56.999 --> 42:57.999
Ryan.

42:58.999 --> 42:59.799
My God, there you are.

42:59.999 --> 43:01.799
What the fuckare you doing here?

43:01.999 --> 43:03.999
What do you meanwhat am I doing here?
I came to find your ass.

43:04.199 --> 43:05.999
You're the one that texted me.

43:06.199 --> 43:07.999
I didn't text you.

43:08.199 --> 43:08.799
Sure you did.

43:08.999 --> 43:09.799
You didn't send me that?

43:09.999 --> 43:12.999
Rescue you.Rescue you from what?

43:13.999 --> 43:15.999
We've got a problem.

43:16.999 --> 43:18.999
Come with me.

43:19.199 --> 43:19.999
Come on.

43:21.999 --> 43:23.799
How could somebody else text me

43:23.999 --> 43:26.999
to come and be here,help you, rescue you,

43:27.199 --> 43:27.799
I don't, I don't...

43:27.999 --> 43:29.999
I did not text you.

43:30.999 --> 43:34.999
The only theory I can thinkis Lydia.

43:57.999 --> 43:59.999
- Callie is deceiving herself...

44:00.999 --> 44:01.999
...us.

44:02.999 --> 44:03.999
Rebelling.

44:04.999 --> 44:05.999
What you do about her?

44:11.999 --> 44:12.999
We must convince her.

44:35.999 --> 44:36.799
Sister,

44:36.999 --> 44:39.999
where have you been?We were worried.

44:40.199 --> 44:40.999
We need to talk.

44:41.999 --> 44:43.999
I'm so sorry, Tess.

44:45.999 --> 44:46.799
I'm not like you.

44:46.999 --> 44:49.999
I wasn't like me once either.

44:50.199 --> 44:50.999
- Don't forsake us again,

44:52.999 --> 44:54.999
or we'll perish.

44:57.999 --> 45:00.999
I'm being torn in twodirections,
it's so hard.

45:01.199 --> 45:01.999
It is.

45:09.999 --> 45:10.999
But you must keep trying.

45:11.199 --> 45:12.999
But I'm different.

45:14.999 --> 45:16.799
I don't think you are.

45:16.999 --> 45:18.999
I've made a decision, Tess.

45:19.999 --> 45:20.999
I'm choosing Dan.

45:21.999 --> 45:22.799
This can't happen.

45:22.999 --> 45:24.999
I'll be leaving in the morning.

45:27.999 --> 45:28.999
You can't go.

45:29.999 --> 45:32.999
We have stood by youall these years.

45:39.999 --> 45:40.999
We get the same text...

45:41.999 --> 45:43.999
...and then calliejust goes missing?

45:47.999 --> 45:50.799
Forget this, man,let's blow this joint.

45:50.999 --> 45:52.999
I'll take you back to London,
we'll go hang at the restaurant.

45:53.199 --> 45:55.999
No, no. Fuck that.
I'm not leavinguntil I found Callie.

45:56.199 --> 45:57.999
Forget that girl, man, fuck her.

45:58.199 --> 45:58.999
No, no, fuck you.

45:59.999 --> 46:03.999
I'm sick and tired about
hearingabout your fucking restaurant.

46:04.999 --> 46:07.799
The place makes me sick,all right.

46:07.999 --> 46:12.999
My wife died in that kitchenwhere
you prepareyour shitty food.

46:13.199 --> 46:14.999
It's like eatingher fucking flesh.

46:18.999 --> 46:19.999
I'm done with it.

46:21.999 --> 46:22.999
I"m moving on.

46:23.999 --> 46:26.709
I mean,
after all isn't thatwhat you fucking wanted?

46:26.999 --> 46:27.999
I'm gonna pretendyou didn't say that.

46:32.999 --> 46:34.999
Oh, sorry.

46:35.999 --> 46:36.999
We have a guest.

46:37.199 --> 46:37.999
No, I'm...

46:38.199 --> 46:38.999
You're Ryan,

46:39.999 --> 46:40.799
I know,

46:40.999 --> 46:41.999
we've been expecting you.

46:43.999 --> 46:47.999
Dinner will be served shortlyif you'd like
to make your waydown to the dining room.

46:48.199 --> 46:48.999
After you.

46:54.999 --> 46:55.999
Callie will be joining us soon,daniel.

47:05.999 --> 47:06.799
This stuff is excellent.

47:06.999 --> 47:08.999
I thought we were going to jam.

47:09.999 --> 47:10.999
We are jamming.

47:12.999 --> 47:14.999
We must at leastget really drunk.

47:15.999 --> 47:16.999
So that sounds good.

47:17.999 --> 47:19.999
Now that I'm leaving the island,
can I be your singer?

47:20.199 --> 47:20.999
Of course you can.

47:21.999 --> 47:22.999
When did you join the band?

47:23.199 --> 47:23.999
About a month ago.

47:25.999 --> 47:26.999
She replaced my best mate Sam.

47:27.999 --> 47:28.999
Did I?

47:29.999 --> 47:29.999
He died.

47:31.999 --> 47:33.999
Why didn't you tell meabout this before?

47:34.199 --> 47:34.999
It was about time.

47:38.999 --> 47:40.999
All right.
He could bea real pain in the ass.

47:41.199 --> 47:42.799
We don't have to talk about it.

47:42.999 --> 47:45.999
- I just wanted to loosen him upbefore the gig.
- Ethan, stop!

47:46.199 --> 47:46.799
So, I spiked his drink.

47:46.999 --> 47:48.999
Turns out he hadthis medical condition.

47:49.199 --> 47:49.999
We didn't knowanything about it.

47:50.199 --> 47:51.799
He was a great musician.

47:51.999 --> 47:55.799
Way better than me,
the pigswere after me from the start.

47:55.999 --> 48:01.999
Lennie hadn'tgiven me an alibi,
but shealways comes through for me.

48:02.199 --> 48:04.499
I...

48:04.699 --> 48:06.799
Go on.

48:06.999 --> 48:07.999
I killed him.

48:09.999 --> 48:10.999
I killed him.And I got away with it.

48:11.199 --> 48:11.999
It was an accident.

48:12.999 --> 48:13.999
I knew,

48:14.999 --> 48:15.999
and deep down,

48:16.999 --> 48:20.999
she knows I knew.

48:21.999 --> 48:23.999
I have to get out.

48:25.999 --> 48:27.399
- You all have to leave.

48:27.599 --> 48:29.199
Are you listening to me?

48:29.399 --> 48:30.999
- Get off this island, now!

48:39.999 --> 48:43.999
Of course I don'tblame the sisters,
they can'thelp it if all kinds of...

48:44.199 --> 48:47.999
...rouges,
and riffraffcome to show hospitality.

48:48.199 --> 48:48.999
No, I'm rightabout this aren't I?

48:49.199 --> 48:49.799
Yes.

48:49.999 --> 48:50.999
Good evening everyone.

48:51.999 --> 48:55.799
Don't worry, Daniel,
calliewill be joining us shortly.

48:55.999 --> 48:58.999
Now, it is my absolute pleasureto
inform youthat one of our finest calves

48:59.199 --> 49:01.799
is being slaughteredfor this evening's meal.

49:01.999 --> 49:06.999
We do after all havea renowned food
criticand restaurateur in our company.

49:07.199 --> 49:08.999
I see you've metour other guests.

49:21.999 --> 49:24.999
Callie will be all rightin the morning.

49:25.199 --> 49:25.999
You guys are fucked up.

49:26.999 --> 49:29.999
Oh fuck. I'm gonna get smashed.

49:36.999 --> 49:40.999
I have it on very good authoritythat we
have a recoveringvegetarian in our midst.

49:43.999 --> 49:49.999
And I just like to reassure himor her that
we take great careof our livestock here.

49:50.199 --> 49:53.499
We keep them safe and well fed.

49:53.699 --> 49:55.749
Oh, that's nice isn't it,george?

49:55.949 --> 49:57.799
Until they're up for the chop.

49:57.999 --> 50:02.799
Even then, George I can assureyou
it's a very civil affair.

50:02.999 --> 50:08.999
They barely feel a thing.We all come to
our endone way or another, do we not?

50:09.199 --> 50:13.799
Now, as we eat tonight,
I pray we take a moment...

50:13.999 --> 50:18.999
...to considerthe mortality of the
livingand the souls of the dead.

50:21.999 --> 50:24.799
And what have we here,miss Lydia?

50:24.999 --> 50:28.999
Well this, in my opinionis one
of the finestcuts we've ever had,

50:29.199 --> 50:31.999
a delicacy some might say.

50:47.999 --> 50:48.999
Ethan?

50:51.999 --> 50:52.999
Ethan, get up.

50:54.751 --> 50:55.999
God, I'm starving.

51:52.999 --> 51:57.999
The verdictof the critic is upon us.

51:58.999 --> 51:59.999
Five star.

52:00.999 --> 52:04.999
So the local faredoes have a
knackfor coaxing the tongue.

52:05.199 --> 52:06.999
First class, Lydia, first class.

52:32.999 --> 52:34.999
Ethan?

52:35.999 --> 52:36.999
Ethan?

52:37.999 --> 52:38.999
Ethan?

52:52.999 --> 52:53.999
Ethan?

52:58.999 --> 52:59.999
Ethan?

53:07.999 --> 53:08.999
Ethan?

53:47.999 --> 53:48.999
No!

54:01.999 --> 54:03.799
Ethan?

54:03.999 --> 54:07.999
No!

54:10.999 --> 54:12.999
The hour's now, Callie.

54:19.999 --> 54:21.399
Lennie!

54:21.599 --> 54:22.999
Ethan?

54:27.999 --> 54:28.999
Ethan!

54:32.999 --> 54:34.999
Tess! No!

54:35.999 --> 54:38.999
No! Get off me.They're trying to destroy us.

54:39.375 --> 54:40.799
We are here for a reason.

54:40.999 --> 54:42.999
You're kept here as a prisoner.

54:43.199 --> 54:44.999
It can't be. We all die.

54:51.999 --> 54:54.999
Um, you said beef.It's interesting.

54:55.999 --> 54:55.999
How is it prepared?

54:56.999 --> 54:58.799
Family secret, I"m afraid.

54:58.999 --> 55:00.999
I could tell you,
but then I'd have to kill you.

55:01.999 --> 55:03.899
- What's happened?
- Callie.

55:04.099 --> 55:05.999
What about Callie?Where is she?

55:06.199 --> 55:06.999
Callie, in the woods.

55:12.999 --> 55:14.399
Dan, Dan.What are we doing, man?

55:14.599 --> 55:15.999
This place isa fucking freak show.

55:16.199 --> 55:17.799
Let's get out of here.

55:17.999 --> 55:19.999
I'm not sure what elvirawas serving
back there,but it wasn't beef.

55:20.709 --> 55:21.799
I know you heard that scream,man.

55:21.999 --> 55:25.999
We're going to go get Callie.
I can't lose another one.

55:26.199 --> 55:26.799
Forget about her.

55:26.999 --> 55:28.999
Let's go get the cops,
they'll take care of everything.

55:29.999 --> 55:31.799
- Why are you here?
- What?

55:31.999 --> 55:33.999
Seriously, why the fuckare you here?

55:34.199 --> 55:34.999
I came to help you.

55:35.199 --> 55:36.799
So help me.

55:36.999 --> 55:39.999
Don't stand there and
pretendyou give a shit about me.

55:40.199 --> 55:41.999
All you care aboutis
your fucking restaurant.

55:42.199 --> 55:43.999
Dan, I'm your friend.

55:44.199 --> 55:44.799
Friend?

55:44.999 --> 55:47.799
Is that why you fucked my wife?

55:47.999 --> 55:49.542
What? You don't thinki don't remember?

55:49.999 --> 55:53.399
You took my business.
You fucked my wife.You took everything.

55:53.599 --> 55:56.999
When I found you, youcouldn't
flip a fucking burger.I made you.

55:57.199 --> 55:57.999
- You made me?
- Yeah.

55:58.199 --> 55:58.999
You made me?

55:59.999 --> 56:02.799

01:02:45.999 --> 01:02:45.799
Ah!

01:02:45.999 --> 01:02:49.799
You will die here!

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:53.999
Did you think you could
stealour sister away from us?

01:02:54.999 --> 01:03:00.999
You are a dream to Callie.
She will awakenand you will be forgotten.

01:03:17.999 --> 01:03:19.999
We've been waiting for you.

01:03:21.999 --> 01:03:23.000
Pathetic.

01:03:24.999 --> 01:03:26.999
Just like all the others.
And you wanted to be with that?

01:03:28.999 --> 01:03:29.999
Callie.

01:03:30.999 --> 01:03:32.799
I found who I am.

01:03:32.999 --> 01:03:35.999
He told me what you did.

01:03:38.999 --> 01:03:39.999
My sisters were right.

01:03:40.709 --> 01:03:41.999
I've been blinded by love.

01:03:49.999 --> 01:03:51.999
I wanted to be with you.

01:03:52.999 --> 01:03:53.999
I love you, Callie. Please.

01:03:54.999 --> 01:03:55.999
Callie.

Let us hear your true voice.

01:04:00.199 --> 01:04:00.999
Go on, Callie.

01:04:03.999 --> 01:04:05.799
Please.

01:04:05.999 --> 01:04:08.399
What really happened, Dan?

01:04:08.599 --> 01:04:10.199
I want to hear you say it.

01:04:10.399 --> 01:04:11.999
You really had the truth.

01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:19.999
Ryan...

01:05:20.999 --> 01:05:22.399
...I've killed Annie.

01:05:22.599 --> 01:05:23.999
You've got to help me.

01:05:25.999 --> 01:05:26.999
We got to clean this up.

01:05:30.999 --> 01:05:32.999
We got to make this look real.

01:05:47.999 --> 01:05:49.542
You killed her.

01:05:50.999 --> 01:05:52.999
I had to.

01:05:53.999 --> 01:05:55.999
I had to.

01:05:57.999 --> 01:05:59.999
I had to.

01:06:01.999 --> 01:06:03.999
She broke my heart

01:06:04.999 --> 01:06:07.999
and you ripped hers out.

01:06:08.999 --> 01:06:12.999
Callie.Callie, please.

01:06:41.999 --> 01:06:45.999
You think it's a dream,
when really it's a nightmare.

01:08:41.999 --> 01:08:42.999
Those tortured souls...

01:08:45.999 --> 01:08:46.999
...are never quiet...

01:08:48.999 --> 01:08:51.999
...their cries heardup through the earth...

...in the wind...

01:08:57.999 --> 01:09:01.899
...they demandthat their secrets be told...

01:09:02.099 --> 01:09:05.999
...and there are creaturesout
there who listen.
