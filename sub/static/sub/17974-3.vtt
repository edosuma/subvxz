There's no way, Cleveland!

00:38.506 --> 00:39.671
I'll never make it!

00:39.673 --> 00:41.807
You're not missing
Thanksgiving, Holt!

00:41.809 --> 00:43.308
Sir, I'm gonna
need you to...

00:43.310 --> 00:44.977
Late for a plane!
There's no time!

00:44.979 --> 00:46.345
Late for a plane?!

00:46.347 --> 00:48.047
We need backup at Terminal 2.

00:48.049 --> 00:49.948
A passenger is late for a plane.

00:52.685 --> 00:54.319
Out of the way!
They're late for a plane!

00:54.321 --> 00:56.188
Swear to God you're
not a terrorist?

00:56.190 --> 00:57.856
I swear to Allah.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.691
Go, go, go!

00:59.693 --> 01:01.193
God, I hope they make it.

01:01.195 --> 01:02.528
(tires screech)

01:02.530 --> 01:04.196
I need to commandeer
your vehicle.

01:04.198 --> 01:05.497
Someone's late for a plane!

01:09.436 --> 01:10.769
(gasps)
(gasps)

01:14.007 --> 01:15.908
Are you Mr. Richter?

01:15.910 --> 01:19.912
Oh, my God, I am
so sorry, y'all.

01:19.914 --> 01:21.847
Y'all's flight
already went.

01:21.849 --> 01:23.048
I told them to wait.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.249
We did wait a
little while,

01:24.251 --> 01:25.717
but then we didn't
know what to do

01:25.719 --> 01:28.253
'cause everyone already
on the plane wanted to go.

01:28.255 --> 01:31.623
I'm so sorry.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.726
I'm sorry you won't
get to spend Thanksgiving

01:34.728 --> 01:36.128
with your family, Holt.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.230
What?! I wasn't going
to see my family.

01:38.232 --> 01:40.766
I signed up for the <i>Entourage</i>
<i>Thanksgiving in Hollywood.</i>

01:40.768 --> 01:42.868
For 6,000 bucks, Johnny Drama
cooks you a Thanksgiving omelet,

01:42.870 --> 01:44.236
then leaves the room
so you don't

01:44.238 --> 01:45.804
have to look at him
while you eat it.

01:45.806 --> 01:47.372
But why didn't you want
to be with your family?

01:47.374 --> 01:49.575
Did. Wasn't invited.

01:49.577 --> 01:51.577
Mom has three boyfriends
in Florida.

01:51.579 --> 01:53.545
Says I cramp her style. I do.

01:53.547 --> 01:55.114
Probably shouldn't
call them all "Dad."

01:55.116 --> 01:58.450
That's sad.
That's sad.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.785
Come on, Holt.

01:59.787 --> 02:02.454
Why don't you
buy us all a drink?

02:02.456 --> 02:04.456
This airport is stupid.

02:04.458 --> 02:06.125
There's no bar here!

02:06.127 --> 02:08.260
I'm gonna blow this place up!
(people gasp)

02:08.262 --> 02:12.498
I swear to God, I'm gonna
blow this whole place up!

02:12.500 --> 02:15.400
Or we could, uh,
just go to The Stool.

02:15.402 --> 02:16.902
All right.

02:16.904 --> 02:19.404
You're all lucky
to be alive!

02:21.975 --> 02:26.111
Boy, I can't wait to spend
Thanksgiving with my fam-- Oh.

02:26.113 --> 02:28.113
Don't worry
about it, guys.

02:28.115 --> 02:29.081
I'm used to it.

02:29.083 --> 02:30.282
Not close to
my family.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.617
Haven't been
for years.

02:31.619 --> 02:32.818
Wish I was.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.353
You know what we need to do?

02:34.355 --> 02:35.754
What, Cleveland? What?!

02:35.756 --> 02:38.657
We need to open a bar
at that airport.

02:38.659 --> 02:43.162
People need a stiff drink after
being gate-raped by the TSA.

02:43.164 --> 02:44.263
You know what?

02:44.265 --> 02:45.931
One of Cleveland's
can't-lose schemes

02:45.933 --> 02:49.034
is just the kind of thing I
need to get me out of my funk.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.035
I'm in.

02:50.037 --> 02:51.203
Oh.

02:51.205 --> 02:53.505
I guess we could
include you, too.

02:53.507 --> 02:56.275
Gus, we have a business
proposition for you.

02:56.277 --> 02:59.244
Sorry, guys, I got
all the llamas I need.

03:02.282 --> 03:04.883
What majestic creatures.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.485
Yes, you are.

03:06.487 --> 03:07.986
Who's majestic?

03:07.988 --> 03:09.321
You.

03:09.323 --> 03:10.789
You are.

03:10.791 --> 03:13.959
Good majestic llama.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.494
I feed them garbage.

03:15.496 --> 03:17.162
Okay.

03:17.164 --> 03:21.333
Gus, I want to make a
Stool in the airport.

03:21.335 --> 03:22.534
Daddy's got business.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.669
That's right.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.704
The Broken Stool
Number Two.

03:25.706 --> 03:28.307
If you're willing to
assume all the risk,

03:28.309 --> 03:30.175
then we're willing
to take time

03:30.177 --> 03:32.544
from the jobs we never
go to to make it happen.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.679
What do you say?

03:33.681 --> 03:35.714
Well, you know, the truth is,

03:35.716 --> 03:39.051
I've always wanted to franchise,
and I could use the money.

03:39.053 --> 03:42.354
I promised my niece Cheryl
I'd put her through college.

03:42.356 --> 03:44.022
Ooh, college.

03:44.024 --> 03:45.257
I'm smart.

03:45.259 --> 03:46.358
President Cheryl.

03:46.360 --> 03:48.093
(laughter)

03:48.095 --> 03:50.229
Yes, I know
it's crazy.

03:50.231 --> 03:52.097
Count me in,
Cleveland.

crashed and (bleep), son!

04:03.744 --> 04:07.346
Oh, snap, now the alien is
all leaving the spaceship, yo!

04:07.348 --> 04:08.680

04:08.682 --> 04:10.449
Now he shooting

04:10.451 --> 04:11.750
He shooting at him!

04:11.752 --> 04:13.018
Y'all shut up!

04:13.020 --> 04:14.686
I'm trying to watch a movie!

Gobble?

04:23.264 --> 04:24.796
I need you
to watch Rallo today.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.365
(groans):
Gobble.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.600
Because it's almost
Thanksgiving, that's gobble.

04:28.602 --> 04:31.236
I got to hunt the turkey,
shoot it, cut its head off,

04:31.238 --> 04:32.771
drain it, gut it,
pluck it, stuff it...

04:32.773 --> 04:34.573
All right, I'll watch him.

04:34.575 --> 04:36.408
But I'm not gonna
watch him good.

04:36.410 --> 04:39.177

Ow!

04:57.798 --> 04:59.097
What the hell, Rallo?!

04:59.099 --> 05:01.166
How come you felt that one
and not the first four?

05:01.168 --> 05:02.334
What?

05:03.269 --> 05:05.937
One, two, three, four.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.306
(babbling)

05:07.308 --> 05:09.107
Okay, we'll leave
that one in there.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.609
Enough of this
bull rassum!

05:10.611 --> 05:14.279
You need a big boy task that'll
keep you busy and over there.

05:14.281 --> 05:16.415
So go help Holt sort
through those screws.

05:16.417 --> 05:18.016
But...
Do it and
you can have

05:18.018 --> 05:19.751
all the vermouth
you want.

05:19.753 --> 05:20.952
All right!

05:20.954 --> 05:22.354
I don't know
what that is.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.022
Hey, Rallo.

05:24.024 --> 05:25.324
What's up,
little man?

05:25.326 --> 05:28.293
Too bummed about Thanksgiving
to make a pun about screws.

05:28.295 --> 05:29.528
Eh, screw it.

05:29.530 --> 05:33.131
Huh, even at my lowest,
I'm funnier than everyone else.

05:33.133 --> 05:34.466
(sighs)

05:34.468 --> 05:37.302
I'll tell you, Rallo, this time
of year's the worst for me.

05:37.304 --> 05:40.005
Mom ditches me to go to Florida,
never even brings me back

05:40.007 --> 05:42.474
a baby alligator, even though
I'd totally take care of it.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.942
Ah, who am I kidding?

05:43.944 --> 05:46.311
No baby alligator's
gonna love me.

05:46.313 --> 05:47.679
You're not a
bad little man.

05:47.681 --> 05:49.114
You just need
a friend.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.949
I got a friend. C-Bro.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.885
CLEVELAND:
He can't even sort
the damn screws!

05:53.887 --> 05:55.954
Why don't we get
some fresh air.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.860
Come on. Jungle gym
always cheers me up.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.862
This is kids' stuff, man.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.231
You call that
kids' stuff?

06:07.500 --> 06:08.500
Whoa!

06:08.502 --> 06:10.369
Talk about
Parks and Recreation.

06:10.371 --> 06:12.471

06:16.343 --> 06:17.409
RALLO:
Oh, boy.

06:17.411 --> 06:20.479
'Cause I can
make your bed rock.

06:20.481 --> 06:25.050
I don't get your references
or anybody's references.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.018
That's my big buddy, Holt.

06:27.020 --> 06:29.020
We watch cartoons together.

06:29.022 --> 06:30.355
He takes care of me

06:30.357 --> 06:33.358
'cause my daddy
lights the spoon on fire.

06:33.360 --> 06:34.693
Aw.

06:34.695 --> 06:38.397
You know, I judged you
way too harshly before.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.432
I'm hot, so I'm a bitch.

06:40.434 --> 06:41.566
Here's my number.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.769
I'll see you
at 8:00.

06:43.771 --> 06:47.205
See? Maybe all you need to
take your mind off Thanksgiving

06:47.207 --> 06:49.074
are those breasts
and thighs.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.543
Get it? Turkey and
lady similarities?

06:51.545 --> 06:52.511
Aw, yeah!

06:52.513 --> 06:54.346
When I'm done with her,
there's gonna be

06:54.348 --> 06:59.117
plenty of leftovers
for, uh... sandwiches.

06:59.119 --> 07:00.552
Anyway, thanks.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.020
How can I repay you?

07:02.022 --> 07:04.289
With money and things.

07:06.292 --> 07:07.993
Cue the lights!

07:09.729 --> 07:10.962

And there they go.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.251
Wha...? What's going on?

07:33.253 --> 07:36.555
This is the only place to get
alcohol in the entire airport.

07:36.557 --> 07:39.758
Why is everybody going into
this stupid grape store?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.460
Welcome.

07:41.462 --> 07:43.462
I drive a very nice car.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.564
So we lose
the blue state crowd.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.598
We'll be fine.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.799
What's on the other side of us?

07:47.801 --> 07:50.101
"Bier Garten"?

07:50.103 --> 07:51.436
What does that mean?

07:51.438 --> 07:52.571
Sounds German.

07:52.573 --> 07:55.941
All right, I'm gonna
start with "garten."

07:55.943 --> 07:59.578
Okay, "garten" is... garden.

07:59.580 --> 08:00.645
That's fine.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.013
Nothing to worry about there.

08:02.015 --> 08:04.616
Okay, "bier," "bier"...

08:04.618 --> 08:06.451
Oh, it's pronounced "beer."

08:06.453 --> 08:07.986
And it means beer.

08:07.988 --> 08:09.721
Uh, guys.

08:14.827 --> 08:16.595
Boy, are we dumb.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.096
Uhp, other people's money.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.431
GUS:
Hey, fellas.

08:19.433 --> 08:22.300
Can't help but notice that
there's no one in our bar.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.301
Nope.

08:23.303 --> 08:24.769
Cleveland, six
months before

08:24.771 --> 08:27.506
the federal government
relocated me to Stoolbend,

08:27.508 --> 08:30.375
my dying sister
turned to me and said,

08:30.377 --> 08:32.944
"Gus, will you promise me
one thing?"

08:32.946 --> 08:35.046
And I said, "Anything, Courtney.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.781
"You did, after all, raise me

08:36.783 --> 08:39.284
after Dad killed Mom
and then himself."

08:39.286 --> 08:42.020
She said, "Gus, promise me

08:42.022 --> 08:45.624
that Cheryl will attend
Drake University."

08:45.626 --> 08:46.725
Your sister's name
was Courtney?!

08:46.727 --> 08:48.860
"And if anyone gets in the way,

08:48.862 --> 08:51.129
cut off their nose and lips!"

08:51.131 --> 08:52.831
Okay.
And you won't be

08:52.833 --> 08:54.799
welcome back at my bar.

08:54.801 --> 08:56.134

But where will we go

08:56.136 --> 08:58.003
when we don't want
to talk to our wives?!

08:58.005 --> 09:00.138
We can't come here;
this place sucks.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.807
Make this work,
Cleveland.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.876
Got your nose.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.511
Oh, God!

09:06.513 --> 09:07.913
How'd he do that?!

09:07.915 --> 09:09.814
Give it back, give it back!

09:10.716 --> 09:13.585
He means business.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.558
Where's Tim?

09:19.560 --> 09:20.926
(whispers):
I'm right here.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.160
You look like
Rutger Hauer.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.862
Why do you look
like Rutger Hauer?

09:23.864 --> 09:25.196
I'm hiding from Gus.

09:25.198 --> 09:26.531
No bear here!

09:26.533 --> 09:28.600
Just a surfer dude
from California

09:28.602 --> 09:31.670
that Gus would have no interest
in making into a rug.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.738
Great.
This bar is a failure,

09:33.740 --> 09:37.275
Gus is going to kill us,
and I got ham'roids like a muh.

09:37.277 --> 09:41.046
Boys, we got trouble
with a capital...

09:41.048 --> 09:43.048
G?

09:43.050 --> 09:45.550
Well, since no one else
is gonna be drinking this...

09:45.552 --> 09:47.719
beer me, brah.

09:47.721 --> 09:51.523
Although being from L.A.,
I really prefer, uh, cocaine.

09:53.893 --> 09:55.927
(hip-hop beat playing
over stereo)

09:55.929 --> 09:57.963
There you are.
What took you so long?

09:57.965 --> 09:59.097
(car alarm chirps)
Sorry, man.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.899
Crossing guard thinks
just 'cause I'm black,

10:00.901 --> 10:02.734
I can't have a
scooter this nice.

10:02.736 --> 10:04.269
Look, if you want
to keep living large,

10:04.271 --> 10:05.971
you better get
your head in the game.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.205
There's today's target.

10:09.976 --> 10:10.942
Twins, huh?

10:10.944 --> 10:13.144
Probably gonna
have to skin a knee.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.913
(snaps fingers)
Merry-go-round.

10:14.915 --> 10:17.549
When I turn on the waterworks,
bring me this.

10:17.551 --> 10:20.085
Time for me
to get paid.

10:20.087 --> 10:21.920
And me to get laid.

10:21.922 --> 10:23.388

11:01.628 --> 11:03.962
That's why I love being
a Big Brother to Rallo.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.598
I get to rediscover the world
through a child's eyes.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.634
That's so sweet.

11:09.636 --> 11:12.437

than Lil Wayne

11:44.171 --> 11:46.137
before his 30th birthday.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.672
Want to call it?
It's nice out.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.174
Let's hang for
a little bit.

11:49.176 --> 11:51.009
All right.
Give me another push.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.177
Higher.

11:52.179 --> 11:54.112
Higher.

11:55.181 --> 11:56.347
Higher!

11:56.349 --> 11:57.382
Whee!

11:57.384 --> 11:59.050
Aah, too high! Too high!

11:59.052 --> 12:00.185
Ah, there you go.

12:00.187 --> 12:03.054
Hey, why don't you hop in
and give it a go?

12:03.056 --> 12:05.490
Oh, no. No,
I... I can't.

12:06.525 --> 12:09.561
I... I don't know
how to swing, Rallo.

12:09.563 --> 12:11.396
What? How come?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.697
Never learned.

12:12.699 --> 12:14.532
Mom said swinging
was too dangerous.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.201
Dad was always
too busy.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.069
Cat's in the cradle,
silver spoon.

12:18.071 --> 12:20.038
Ricky Schroder.
Then Rick Schroder.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.406
Now back to
Ricky Schroder.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.174
My dad's busy
a lot, too.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.009
When's the last time
you saw yours?

12:25.011 --> 12:26.444
Man, it's
been months.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.079
What is it,
November?

12:28.081 --> 12:30.715
Yeah, it's been
154 months.

12:30.717 --> 12:32.884
Well, I taught myself
how to swing,

12:32.886 --> 12:34.385
and I can teach
you, too.

12:34.387 --> 12:37.422
All you got to do is
kick your legs forward.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.290
Now tuck them
when you go back.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.593
See? Kick and tuck.

12:41.595 --> 12:43.862
Kick and tuck.

12:43.864 --> 12:45.964
Don't let me go.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.668
I think I'm getting it.

12:52.471 --> 12:54.773
I've got it!
You can let go of me.

12:54.775 --> 12:56.574
I already did.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.076
I'm swinging!
I'm swinging!

12:58.078 --> 12:59.711
Look at me,
every daddy!

12:59.713 --> 13:01.212
I mean, everybody.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.580
(chuckles)
Why did I say "daddy"?

13:02.582 --> 13:03.748
Don't care about him.

13:03.750 --> 13:05.150
Just like he
didn't care about me.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.651
I-I mean, whee!

13:09.288 --> 13:11.289
Oh, what a night.

13:11.291 --> 13:14.259
I totally forgot
that we're all screwed.

13:14.261 --> 13:16.127
We should get drunk
on the tarmac

13:16.129 --> 13:18.296
like this more often,

13:18.298 --> 13:21.900
like every single pilot
for every single airline,

13:21.902 --> 13:24.235
without exception,
allegedly.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.271
I'm surprised no one
tried to stop us

13:26.273 --> 13:29.374
when we built our
lost luggage burning man.

13:33.445 --> 13:35.079
Ain't nobody here but the beer.

13:35.081 --> 13:36.815
It's Thanksgiving Day.

13:36.817 --> 13:39.284
Everyone's gone
where they was going.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.719
Nobody's flying
these planes today.

13:42.755 --> 13:45.356
Hey, they left the keys
in this one.

13:48.427 --> 13:50.762
You're not supposed
to fly drunk, Cleveland!

13:50.764 --> 13:53.364
Not drunk--
just had beer.

13:57.303 --> 13:59.170
How hard could flying be?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.773
Worst case scenario,
I hit a goose,

14:01.775 --> 14:04.275
land in a river, I'm a hero.

14:04.277 --> 14:06.477
Clevey Clevenburger.

14:06.479 --> 14:09.214
I like the sound of that.

14:09.216 --> 14:12.283
Adios,
Thanksgiving turkeys.

14:12.285 --> 14:16.054
Have fun getting
murdered by Gus.

14:17.823 --> 14:20.291
Does he, uh, know how
to land that thing?

14:20.293 --> 14:21.860
Sure. He used
to be a pilot.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.194
I think that
was Quagmire.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.562
Oh.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.297
Well, at least
he's going to die

14:26.299 --> 14:29.400
doing what he loves--
burning in a fireball.

14:35.074 --> 14:36.407
I got to thank
you, Rallo.

14:36.409 --> 14:38.343
Banging chicks, hanging
out, watching TV,

14:38.345 --> 14:40.211
drinking chocolate milk
with a five-year-old--

14:40.213 --> 14:41.546
this Thanksgiving's
been pretty sick.

14:41.548 --> 14:42.847
(doorbell rings)

14:42.849 --> 14:45.917
Well, it's about
to get even sicker.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.186
Holt.

14:48.188 --> 14:49.153
Dad!

14:49.155 --> 14:51.556
What did you
call me, maggot?

14:51.558 --> 14:53.024
General Richter, sir!

14:53.026 --> 14:54.359
That's right, maggot.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.526
Now, who's this
maggot here?

14:55.528 --> 14:56.995
I'm Rallo.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.529
So you're the maggot
who called me.

14:58.531 --> 15:02.066
Always good to put a maggot's
face to a maggot's name.

15:02.068 --> 15:04.869
Now, both of you maggots
drop and give me 20.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.037
20 push-ups?

15:06.039 --> 15:07.338
For what?

15:07.340 --> 15:09.073
For being maggots.

15:09.075 --> 15:11.843
Thanks for ruining
my first good Thanksgiving.

15:11.845 --> 15:13.511
I take it we
won't be hitting

15:13.513 --> 15:15.847
the stores together
on Black Friday?

15:15.849 --> 15:17.515
I don't know
your holidays.

15:21.854 --> 15:25.056
So you one of those
classic hard-ass,

15:25.058 --> 15:27.091
tough-guy generals
who are more comfortable

15:27.093 --> 15:29.694
barking orders
than they are with emotions?

15:29.696 --> 15:32.196
You're damn right I am,
you pathetic little panda turd!

15:32.198 --> 15:34.565
Now, drop and give me 20.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.869
Yeah, this is going to be
a good Thanksgiving.

15:37.871 --> 15:40.939
And as for you,
you limp-wristed panty model,

15:40.941 --> 15:43.241
where is this oil you struck?

15:43.243 --> 15:45.743
You told him about my
limp-wristed panty modeling?

15:45.745 --> 15:47.645
When you're 60,
you'll look back

15:47.647 --> 15:49.480
and be glad you got
those pictures.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.982
I didn't strike any oil, sir.

15:50.984 --> 15:53.117
My friend just said that
to get you here.

15:53.119 --> 15:54.819
I left
an unwinnable war

15:54.821 --> 15:57.121
to come see my son
for no reason?!

15:57.123 --> 15:58.990
Good-bye, Holt.

15:58.992 --> 16:00.625
Tell your mother
I still don't forgive her

16:00.627 --> 16:01.926
for cheating on me.

16:01.928 --> 16:04.662
And she owes me
20 push-ups.

16:04.664 --> 16:06.397
Good-bye, sir.

16:07.499 --> 16:09.901
General Richter, sir.

16:09.903 --> 16:12.270
Would you accept a thank-you
for fighting them there

16:12.272 --> 16:14.005
so we don't have
to fight them here

16:14.007 --> 16:16.307
by joining my family
for Thanksgiving?

16:16.309 --> 16:17.775
Rallo, I don't
think that's...

16:17.777 --> 16:18.843
Shut your meat hole!

16:18.845 --> 16:20.611
Why, I'd be honored
to spend Thanksgiving

16:20.613 --> 16:22.113
with a young patriot
like yourself.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.949
I bought this wine from some
fart sniffer at the airport.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.217
I'll bring it.

16:29.955 --> 16:32.457
(imitating jet engine)

16:32.459 --> 16:34.525
(imitating machine gun fire)

16:34.527 --> 16:37.028
Take that, Red Baron.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.162
(giggles)

16:38.164 --> 16:39.831
Oh, what's this thing going on?

16:39.833 --> 16:40.965
(rapid beeping)

16:40.967 --> 16:42.700
All right, I hear you.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.303
This autopilot's pretty sweet.

16:45.305 --> 16:48.506
Auto land.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.974
(clears throat)

16:49.976 --> 16:52.410
Auto land.

16:53.879 --> 16:55.279
(bleep)

16:56.315 --> 16:59.550
Is Beetle Bailey
as lazy as he seems?

16:59.552 --> 17:01.552
Well, I'm afraid
that's classified, son.

17:01.554 --> 17:02.720
Whoa.

17:02.722 --> 17:04.822
News anchor Dwayne Meighan
just tweeted,

17:04.824 --> 17:08.526
"It had had been
there was plane on the sky

17:08.528 --> 17:11.896
"had flied itself,
but update had said not so.

17:11.898 --> 17:14.198
"Man fly plane
name of Cleveland.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.801
He in there. Crash soon."

17:16.803 --> 17:20.004
Oh, wait, no, he was just
re-tweeting Gary Busey.

17:20.006 --> 17:21.572
Oh, my God!
Cleveland!

17:21.574 --> 17:24.876
I wondered why he wasn't
here at Thanksgiving dinner.

17:24.878 --> 17:26.310
Oh, yeah.

17:26.312 --> 17:28.046
Someone's got to save my daddy!

17:28.048 --> 17:30.214
And get a move
on those sweet potatoes.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.383
I'll handle this.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.085
Hot plate! Hot plate!

17:34.087 --> 17:35.420
Now, follow me
to the airport.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.288
There's not a second
to lose.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.359
19, 20.

17:41.361 --> 17:43.027
Listen up,
maggot people.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.328
Here's what's
going to happen.

17:44.330 --> 17:45.763
We're going
to fly up there

17:45.765 --> 17:47.098
and dangle
someone from a rope

17:47.100 --> 17:48.733
down to the
other plane,

17:48.735 --> 17:50.435
just like
catching a fish.

17:50.437 --> 17:52.904
Now, which one
of you maggots

17:52.906 --> 17:55.039
wants to graduate
to worm?

17:55.041 --> 17:56.574
Do it, Holt.

17:57.843 --> 17:59.877
Holt Ann Richter,
reporting for duty.

17:59.879 --> 18:03.014
You? They won't even let you
ride a roller coaster.

18:03.016 --> 18:05.516
Some places do.

18:10.222 --> 18:13.257
As soon as you clip
the African-Ameri-maggot

18:13.259 --> 18:16.094
to your harness,
I'll pull you both back up.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.795
I was born ready!

18:17.797 --> 18:19.263
What?
Sorry.

18:19.265 --> 18:21.466
Thought you asked
if I was ready.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.768
It's really
loud in here.

18:26.939 --> 18:29.807
(alarm blaring)

18:29.809 --> 18:32.110
This isn't funny like <i>Airplane.</i>

18:32.112 --> 18:35.446
It's a disaster
like <i>Airplane II!</i>

18:38.784 --> 18:40.451
What?

18:40.453 --> 18:42.520
I'm here to rescue you.

18:44.056 --> 18:47.058
Dad, you've got
to get me closer!

18:47.060 --> 18:48.960
Well, that's as close
as I can get!

18:48.962 --> 18:51.162
He's kicking up
too much tailwind.

18:51.164 --> 18:52.597
Mission over.

18:52.599 --> 18:54.098
I'm pulling you back up.

18:54.100 --> 18:55.133
No, Dad.

18:55.135 --> 18:56.701
I can do this.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.309
He's doing it.

19:05.311 --> 19:06.410
He's swinging.

19:06.412 --> 19:07.745
How can you
see that far?

19:07.747 --> 19:09.780
I'm not seeing it with these.

19:09.782 --> 19:12.016
I'm seeing it with this.

19:12.018 --> 19:15.119
Kick and tuck.

19:15.121 --> 19:20.791
BOTH:
Kick and tuck.
Kick and tuck.

19:20.793 --> 19:23.094
Kick and tuck!

19:23.096 --> 19:24.428
(alarm blaring)

19:35.841 --> 19:37.909
Sorry. Sorry.

19:39.378 --> 19:42.180
Well, fellas,
we had a good run.

19:42.182 --> 19:43.181
(screams)

19:43.183 --> 19:44.682
Oh, not my nose!

19:44.684 --> 19:46.384
Take my ugly ears.

19:46.386 --> 19:48.452
Relax, Cleveland
and other guys.

19:48.454 --> 19:51.522
Lucky for you, Cheryl
passed away last night.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.124
Oh, thank God.

19:53.126 --> 19:54.559
So you're off
the hook.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.361
What do you think of your
son now, General Richter?

19:57.363 --> 20:00.198
He swung on a rope
like a maggot.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.200
You know what?
You're a maggot.

20:02.202 --> 20:03.201
(gasps)

20:03.203 --> 20:05.536
I am a human being.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.239
Look, your son
just did 120 push-ups

20:08.241 --> 20:09.974
and saved a man's life.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.210
Where I come from,
that means something.

20:12.212 --> 20:14.178
That's enough.
What's your problem?

20:14.180 --> 20:16.047
You want to know what
my problem is?

20:16.049 --> 20:18.216
I'll tell you
what my problem is!

20:18.218 --> 20:21.686
My son couldn't follow
in my footsteps!

20:21.688 --> 20:23.821
Why?
You've got to be

20:23.823 --> 20:26.390
five feet tall
to join the Army.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.025
Five-foot-two in heels.

20:28.027 --> 20:29.060
Not helping.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.695
You're just like
your mother--

20:30.697 --> 20:33.130
short and useless.

20:34.166 --> 20:35.700
You want to know
something, Dad?

20:35.702 --> 20:37.201
I'm proud to be short.

20:37.203 --> 20:39.904
I get to buy my clothes
in the tweens section,

20:39.906 --> 20:41.172
which keeps me hip.

20:41.174 --> 20:42.440
I'm always on
my tiptoes,

20:42.442 --> 20:44.075
which gives me
great calves.

20:44.077 --> 20:46.544
And, General,
my tiny hands

20:46.546 --> 20:49.080
make my privates
look huge,

20:49.082 --> 20:52.049
which they are not.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.252
Good-bye, General.
