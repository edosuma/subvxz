18:47.767 --> 18:48.581
Or horseshoes.

18:48.613 --> 18:50.616
- Note to self...
- [group] Krieger!

18:50.650 --> 18:52.919
What? That was an unrelated
note to self!

18:52.951 --> 18:54.820
[quietly] Lawn dart rifle.

18:54.854 --> 18:56.322
Ugh! Are we at least gonna get paid

18:56.347 --> 18:57.790
back for all of our medical bills?

18:57.824 --> 19:00.259
Sterling is with Shapiro as we speak,

19:00.293 --> 19:02.929
presenting him with an itemized bill.

19:02.961 --> 19:05.331
[Shapiro] But you
must realize, Mr. Archer,

19:05.364 --> 19:08.267
I won't pay one thin dime of this.

19:08.300 --> 19:11.970
Oh, I'm sorry. I
forgot. It's opposite day.

19:12.004 --> 19:14.241
Which means a bunch of cops didn't shoot

19:14.266 --> 19:16.642
the shit out of me
with beanbags, which...

19:16.675 --> 19:19.611
How is that a kid's
toy? Which means I don't know

19:19.644 --> 19:22.449
you hired those
clowns to steal the Tsarina!

19:22.481 --> 19:25.184
[gasps] But h-how did you know?

19:25.218 --> 19:27.286
I didn't. You just told me.

19:27.319 --> 19:28.520
Oh, damn it!

19:28.554 --> 19:30.190
Yeah. Not great. For you.

19:30.222 --> 19:32.959
I mean, when Veronica
finds out you did this.

19:32.991 --> 19:34.460
<i>I did it for her.</i>

19:34.494 --> 19:35.995
- [laughs]
- She's broke.

19:36.027 --> 19:38.498
My God, she's got all
these bills to pay...

19:38.530 --> 19:40.666
health insurance, a huge mortgage...

19:40.700 --> 19:42.634
She can't eat a bunch of
diamonds and emeralds.

19:42.668 --> 19:44.187
So you hired those clowns to steal

19:44.212 --> 19:45.706
it, to get the insurance money...

19:45.738 --> 19:47.873
Old clients of mine.
I got 'em out of jail,

19:47.906 --> 19:50.008
but then they double-cross me.

19:50.042 --> 19:53.046
- And now I bet they're gonna kill me!
- Yeah, probably.

19:53.078 --> 19:55.514
So, the Tsarina is worth...

19:55.547 --> 19:57.483
I mean, like, four million.

19:57.517 --> 19:59.686
And you were gonna pay the
clowns, so you didn't have to worry

19:59.719 --> 20:01.187
about the cops or the insurance company?

20:01.219 --> 20:04.824
Like, a s... four hundred grand?

20:04.856 --> 20:07.493
Yeah. So, I'm gonna
need a half a million in...

20:07.527 --> 20:10.229
- I don't know. Have you got Krugerrands?
- I mean...

20:10.263 --> 20:11.998
- yeah.
- Super. So, that.

20:12.030 --> 20:14.066
And then, if you hear from
Rompers and his gang...

20:14.100 --> 20:16.002
- Which...
- you let me know.

20:16.035 --> 20:19.238
- I owe him one.
- So, you'll protect me?

20:19.271 --> 20:21.173
No. I'll protect Veronica Deane.

20:21.207 --> 20:24.544
- [coins jingling]
- Oh, so, did she ask about me, or...

20:24.576 --> 20:28.213
Did she... [laughing]

20:28.247 --> 20:30.682
Oh, Mr....

20:30.716 --> 20:32.886
[laughing continues]

20:32.919 --> 20:34.554
She...

20:34.586 --> 20:35.587
[sighs]

20:35.621 --> 20:39.258
Whew! No.

20:39.292 --> 20:40.881
There's a nice way to do that.
