01:07.734 --> 01:10.487
<i>They say necessity
is the mother of invention.</i>

01:11.321 --> 01:14.621
<i>That's one thing we've got
here in Detroit: necessity.</i>

01:15.659 --> 01:17.252
<i>Some people gave up.</i>

01:17.828 --> 01:19.796
<i>A lot of us didn't.</i>

01:21.623 --> 01:23.625
<i>Hell, most of us didn't have a choice.</i>

01:26.295 --> 01:31.176
<i>We had to make it,
turn lemons into lemonade.</i>

01:33.552 --> 01:35.600
<i>And if you didn't have any lemons...</i>

01:38.223 --> 01:40.521
<i>well, there's always something.</i>

01:46.565 --> 01:49.444
<i>Yes! Fuck! Ah!</i>

01:49.610 --> 01:52.284
<i>God, yes! Fuck me!</i>

01:52.446 --> 01:54.619
<i>Yeah! Oh, fuck.</i>

01:55.991 --> 01:58.790
So does anyone
recognize that voice?

01:58.952 --> 02:01.421
That's right, it was me.

02:01.580 --> 02:06.586
This modest, even-tempered woman
in front of you. That was me.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.628
I used to be... I was embarrassed.

02:08.794 --> 02:10.388
I was embarrassed of my orgasm.

02:10.547 --> 02:14.643
I was told I was too loud
that I came too much.

02:14.801 --> 02:17.395
I was self-conscious. I was insecure.

02:17.554 --> 02:20.524
And then, you know,
one day I just said, â€œFuck it."

02:20.682 --> 02:23.060
Just... I said, "Fuck it! Just fuck it!"

02:23.560 --> 02:26.689
Ladies, sex is not a job.

02:26.855 --> 02:27.902
It's a way of life.

02:29.816 --> 02:34.617
My name is Tanya Skagle.
Welcome to Orgasmic Living.

02:36.114 --> 02:38.412
<i>Orgasmic Living.</i>

02:38.742 --> 02:40.710
<i>It was a long shot.</i>

02:43.038 --> 02:45.132
Okay, clearly we need
some new ideas.

02:45.290 --> 02:47.918
Well, Ray, what if I'm
out of ideas, all right?

02:48.085 --> 02:50.213
I'm fresh out. I got it, I got it.

02:50.379 --> 02:53.974
Berbig... Berbig... Ber... Berbigs?
Berbiglia?

02:54.132 --> 02:56.931
Ber... I can't... can't read this, Sammy.

02:57.094 --> 02:59.768
No more cursive, all right?
God, it's not even English.

02:59.930 --> 03:01.477
Look, what if this is my destiny?

03:01.640 --> 03:03.313
I mean, I'm good at this crap.

03:03.475 --> 03:05.193
And they have a great health plan.

03:05.352 --> 03:08.231
Don't joke, Tanya.
This is not your destiny.

03:08.397 --> 03:12.243
It's not my destiny to be substitute teaching
twice a week for the rest of my life.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.403
Cammy, where are the filters?

03:14.695 --> 03:18.791
Let's begin with the obvious, okay?
We have an excellent product.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.618
- Women like me.
- Most of the time.

03:21.785 --> 03:25.915
- Berbiglia!
- So, what's the problem?

03:26.081 --> 03:28.049
- Lenore can get clients.
- Let customers in.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.302
- And you can't.
- You're gonna get me fired.

03:30.460 --> 03:36.934
Look, okay, forget it. Just, the point is,
women like me, they like my...

03:37.843 --> 03:39.937
it's not all about your dick, Ray.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.848
Okay, so it's not all about my dick.

03:44.516 --> 03:47.520
- Whats it about?
- All right, what is this place about, Ray?

03:47.686 --> 03:49.688
What do you think?
What's Starbucks about?

03:49.855 --> 03:53.280
I mean, nobody needs coffee so bad
that they're willing to pay $5 a cup...

03:53.442 --> 03:55.661
for some caramel macchiato.

03:55.819 --> 03:57.821
Lenore always said
it was about lifestyle.

03:57.988 --> 04:00.332
It's not about lifestyle. That's bullshit.

04:00.490 --> 04:04.211
We need a place where women
can walk in and feel comfortable...

04:04.369 --> 04:06.872
and it's normal.
And they walk up to the counter...

04:07.038 --> 04:09.382
- ...and they gotta...
- Thank you.

04:09.541 --> 04:10.713
Order.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.385
That's it.

04:18.716 --> 04:21.220
That's it. Yeah!

04:21.386 --> 04:23.764
I quit. I quit. Sammy, I'm out.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.981
Happiness Consultants.
It's a wellness center for women...

04:28.143 --> 04:34.367
coming to a storefront near you,
thanks to Judy Pearson...

04:34.524 --> 04:36.743
and the Certified National Bank.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.705
- Uh-huh.
- We encompass all needs.

04:40.864 --> 04:44.038
All wellness-type needs.

04:44.201 --> 04:47.000
Well, we do lifestyle...

04:48.246 --> 04:51.216
and feminine-type suggestions.

04:51.374 --> 04:54.719
So it's both of you? You're partners?

04:54.878 --> 04:56.551
- Business partners.
- Obviously.

04:56.713 --> 04:59.091
We're not married. We're...

05:00.509 --> 05:03.854
We're not... We're not a couple.

05:04.429 --> 05:09.185
What we're trying to say is that we've
got something special to offer Detroit...

05:09.351 --> 05:12.150
- ...and we'd like to focus on that...
- It's very special.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.815
- ...full-time.
- But what is your product?

05:14.981 --> 05:16.654
Can you tell me that?

05:16.817 --> 05:21.789
Can you give me an example, please,
of what it is that you are selling?

05:28.453 --> 05:30.126
Good boy.

05:30.288 --> 05:31.505
Hand creams.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.174
Organic hand creams.

05:37.087 --> 05:38.839
Organic hand cream?

05:39.005 --> 05:41.133
Eight banks, eight rejections, Ray.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.472
She was our first woman,
how could she say no?

05:43.635 --> 05:45.637
Women who hate women, I hate them.

05:45.804 --> 05:49.308
The only female loan officer we get,
and she's got a stick up her ass.

05:49.474 --> 05:53.524
You know, I probably should've
mentioned the Orgasmic Living part.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.940
I don't think it would have
made a difference.

05:56.106 --> 05:59.030
No, it might have,
because women like orgasms.

05:59.192 --> 06:02.617
Men like orgasms too.
It's not the point.

06:02.779 --> 06:06.409
It doesn't matter what we said.
The banks aren't giving anybody shit.

06:06.575 --> 06:09.374
That's not true.
The small-business Obama grants...

06:09.536 --> 06:12.039
Don't! Don't give me that crap, okay?

06:12.205 --> 06:14.299
The whole country's fucked up right now.

06:14.457 --> 06:17.836
The banks get the big bailouts.
The cops, the auto workers...

06:18.003 --> 06:22.133
the teachers and the perma-temps
get the shaft, okay?

06:22.299 --> 06:26.554
It's the way it works.
Just forget about the storefront, okay?

06:26.761 --> 06:28.889
It was a silly idea.

06:30.348 --> 06:32.100
What are you doing?

06:32.267 --> 06:35.646
Tanya! What...?
It's not her fault. Wait, hey!

06:36.438 --> 06:38.065
Hey!

06:39.649 --> 06:41.526
Come on, Tanya! Come here!

06:42.027 --> 06:43.779
Tanya, get back here.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.039
- Tanya.
- Hi, Judy.

06:46.197 --> 06:52.204
Just... Just one... Just one minute.
I can wait a minute. Are you coming back?

06:52.370 --> 06:54.964
Before you go back there,
just while you're... Hello?

06:55.123 --> 06:58.969
Judy? We were already-
We had an appointment.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.879
- Just a sec. Judy!
- Tanya.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.393
Oh, hi, sorry. Is it on? Okay.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.896
- Yeah, yes.
- About the hand cream.

07:10.055 --> 07:11.978
I know nothing about hand cream.

07:12.140 --> 07:16.395
What I should have said is that
women don'! orgasm enough.

07:16.561 --> 07:20.486
- All right, Tanya. Tanya, come on.
- Just shush for one second.

07:20.649 --> 07:25.496
The thing is we can orgasm more,
both in the bedroom and in life in general.

07:25.654 --> 07:27.907
Sex can be better, Judy.
Our lives can be better.

07:28.073 --> 07:30.701
You, me, the fucking country.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.666
- In fear is where our orgasm lies...
- Okay.

07:33.828 --> 07:35.171
Where our happiness lies.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.800
That is why we need
the Certified National small-business loan.

07:38.959 --> 07:42.304
And that is why I am offering you,
Judy Pearson...

07:42.462 --> 07:45.386
the chance to take our class for free.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.768
I want you to attend.
You can see what it is we do.

07:48.927 --> 07:54.275
There's no obligation, no expectation
and I guarantee you, no regrets.

07:54.432 --> 07:56.981
<i>The whole thing was nuts,
from beginning to end.</i>

07:57.143 --> 08:01.273
<i>But banks and women, well,
they work in mysterious ways.</i>

08:01.856 --> 08:06.532
The vulva.
Have you considered your vulva?

08:06.695 --> 08:10.040
<i>Judy, the loan officer,
and her bank-teller friend Joanie.</i>

08:10.699 --> 08:13.498
<i>Tanya's first Orgasmic Living class.</i>

08:14.744 --> 08:16.792
For years I apologized.

08:16.955 --> 08:22.086
I disregarded myself and my vulva.

08:22.252 --> 08:25.051
But not anymore.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.760
Hold on.

08:30.218 --> 08:34.347
Oh, shit. Sorry, I thought
I had this cued up. Just a sec.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.267
Ladies, some wine?

08:37.433 --> 08:40.107
<i>Fuck, yeah. Fuck, yeah.</i>

08:40.270 --> 08:42.147
<i>Fuck! Fuck, yes!</i>

08:42.647 --> 08:44.115
<i>Fuck!</i>

08:44.274 --> 08:47.118
<i>God, yes! Fuck me!</i>

08:47.277 --> 08:50.907
<i>Yeah. Oh, fuck.</i>

08:51.990 --> 08:53.458
Okay, so, yeah.

08:54.868 --> 08:58.247
That's me. And, really,
in just four short weeks...

08:58.413 --> 09:01.917
you can feel that great too,
both in and out of the bedroom.

09:02.083 --> 09:06.964
That's where we're headed.
But after this we move into the feedback...

09:07.130 --> 09:08.723
and then the practicum.

09:08.882 --> 09:13.058
But we can skip that for now.
So any questions? Any thoughts?

09:13.219 --> 09:16.769
- Yes?
- So you guys want a loan for this?

09:16.931 --> 09:21.482
Oh, yeah, yeah. For the set-up,
the utilities and the overhead.

09:21.644 --> 09:25.820
But we have a lot of confidence
in our program.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.280
Well, there's the private consultations.

09:29.861 --> 09:31.613
- What?
- As my partner said...

09:31.780 --> 09:37.037
after class, we run a practicum. Ahem.
Well, I run the practicum.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.920
Mm-hm.
- Um...

09:39.079 --> 09:41.377
it's where the real money is.

09:42.999 --> 09:47.425
We can do an in-house session...

09:47.587 --> 09:51.433
or we could meet at a public place,
a restaurant, you know.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.310
I could wear this suit,
or I could wear sweatpants.

09:54.469 --> 09:56.972
You know, whatever makes
you feel most comfortable.

09:57.138 --> 10:00.267
I mean, we're really...
We're really very discreet.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.481
We can put it all in writing if you like.

10:02.685 --> 10:05.313
- Um...
- Yeah, yeah.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.482
Joanie, can I talk
to you for a minute?

10:07.649 --> 10:09.276
Hold on a sec, you guys.

10:09.442 --> 10:13.242
We're just gonna
chat on the porch for a second.

10:14.197 --> 10:15.540
Yeah.
- Yeah, no, it's a lot.

10:15.698 --> 10:17.951
- Yeah.
- Take your time.

10:18.952 --> 10:22.627
The vulva? Of all the parts of
the human body to pick, why the vulva?

10:22.789 --> 10:23.836
It's a vulva.

10:23.998 --> 10:26.342
- Think that's gonna get us a loan?
- It's the vulva.

10:26.501 --> 10:28.879
Do not stigmatize the vulva.
That's the whole problem.

10:29.045 --> 10:32.424
Why do you have to freak out every
time something fun is about to happen?

10:32.590 --> 10:35.719
Because my idea of fun and your
idea of fun are not the same thing.

10:35.885 --> 10:38.934
I mean, come on,
private consultation?

10:39.097 --> 10:41.976
- Are you kidding me?
- It's just a date.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.315
- It is not just a date.
- Oh, come on.

10:44.477 --> 10:46.946
It'll be something to laugh
about 10 years from now.

10:47.105 --> 10:49.358
"Fear is where your orgasm lies."

10:49.524 --> 10:52.869
I don't even know what that means.

10:53.611 --> 10:56.581
It's the word, "vulva."

10:56.781 --> 10:58.533
Not sexy.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.305
<i>We didn't have the loan.</i>

11:12.463 --> 11:17.344
<i>But at least Judy agreed to a date,
as long as Joanie was there too.</i>

11:17.510 --> 11:20.514
Even during the Bush administration,
when loans were literally...

11:20.680 --> 11:23.479
just ï¬‚ying out the door, literally.

11:23.641 --> 11:26.064
Yeah, the Bush years
were the boom years.

11:26.227 --> 11:29.356
I had this guy once...

11:29.522 --> 11:32.822
walk up to my window,
and he's got this gun.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.612
It's a squirt gun, okay? I'm sorry.

11:35.778 --> 11:38.247
- You always leave that part out.
- He hands me a note:

11:38.406 --> 11:41.956
"Give me the money
or I'll blow your fucking face off."

11:42.118 --> 11:45.463
So I said, "Go ahead,
blow my face off."

11:45.622 --> 11:49.718
Anyway, security jumps him,
shoots him in the...

11:49.876 --> 11:51.799
- What is that area?
- Groin.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.929
Jo... Sit down. it's the groin.

11:54.088 --> 11:58.594
Now he's doing time at
Saginaw Correctional and pees into a bag.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.602
Hard to be brave when you're
behind bullet-proof glass.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.983
In Loans, we're just
sitting ducks out there.

12:10.104 --> 12:11.981
I'm Judy, the sitting duck!

12:12.148 --> 12:14.401
- Quack!
- Oh, and salut.

12:14.567 --> 12:18.322
- Salut, bottoms up.
- So I love hearing about the stories.

12:18.488 --> 12:22.959
I love hearing you talk about
the bank and banking.

12:23.117 --> 12:28.214
I mean, anything that you're
passionate about, I think. It turns me on.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.793
You know, passion. Judy?

12:31.668 --> 12:34.046
I know what turns me on.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.516
Yes, thank you. Um...

12:42.971 --> 12:45.724
- Um... As we were discussing-
- You know what?

12:45.890 --> 12:47.938
- I think it's...
- I just remembered...

12:48.101 --> 12:50.695
that I have so much work to do
at home. I'm gonna go.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.948
- You guys just have a really good time.
- What, Jude? Come on!

12:54.107 --> 12:57.407
Are you wussing out?
What about the private consultation?

12:57.568 --> 13:00.492
- You said you'd go first.
- I'm not wussing out.

13:00.655 --> 13:04.034
- I don't need a private consultation.
- You're so repressed.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.419
- I'm not repressed.
- When's the last time you saw a penis?

13:06.577 --> 13:09.376
I see penises all the time.
I see them all the time.

13:09.539 --> 13:11.917
You know what? Fine.
I will go upstairs and I will...

13:12.083 --> 13:14.336
Go do what you always do.
Go fuck him upstairs.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.597
That's right, Judy. I'll fuck him.
You can fuck yourself.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.757
- Fuck your... Go fuck yourself!
- Judy, Judy.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.643
No, I am not repressed! I'm not.

13:22.802 --> 13:26.056
- Just because I don't shove my
crotch into peoples' faces like her?

13:26.222 --> 13:29.146
- I'm not repressed. God, I hate her!
- Okay.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.779
When we go out together,
I get left behind every time, always.

13:32.937 --> 13:34.280
- You're not gonna.
- Yes, I am.

13:34.439 --> 13:36.942
Judy, not with me.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.195
Not tonight.

13:41.404 --> 13:45.500
<i>Clearly, the path to Judy
was through Joanie.</i>

13:47.452 --> 13:48.920
I'm sorry, Judy.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.791
It's okay.

14:02.425 --> 14:03.893
All right.

14:11.142 --> 14:14.021
Should we keep it going?

14:40.838 --> 14:44.342
<i>It was starting to look like the
greatest date of my professional career.</i>

15:22.672 --> 15:24.925
Thanks. Thanks, Ray.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.520
We're good.

15:53.870 --> 15:55.838
Forgot my jacket.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.671
- It's right there.
- Yeah.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.966
<i>Okay, I was a little disappointed.</i>

16:17.477 --> 16:21.232
<i>But on Monday morning,
our loan got approved...</i>

16:22.148 --> 16:27.530
<i>for Happiness Consultants,
a wellness center for women.</i>

16:33.576 --> 16:37.080
<i>Orgasmic Living. What a concept.</i>

16:37.246 --> 16:41.752
Why is it so many of us have trouble
expecting pleasure, sexual pleasure?

16:41.918 --> 16:45.718
Even saying the word "vulva"
feels transgressive.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.099
Even right now,
I feel a little transgressive.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.259
<i>We lost some ladies at "vulva."</i>

16:50.426 --> 16:54.476
The cunt as temple, tomb, cave or ï¬‚ower.

16:54.639 --> 16:58.519
I'd like to announce that the Wellness
Center also offers private consultations.

16:58.684 --> 17:02.439
Very private, with a therapist.
It's a female therapist...

17:02.605 --> 17:04.778
or a male... It's a male therapist.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.865
He's very male. Very private.

17:08.027 --> 17:10.951
<i>But those who stayed
made it all worth it.</i>

17:11.113 --> 17:14.458
But I've never met this therapist.

17:14.617 --> 17:20.214
Richard? Richard, could you
bring in the Samson file, please?

17:27.046 --> 17:29.094
- Thank you.
- Sure.

17:29.257 --> 17:30.554
Hi.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.558
That's Richard.

17:37.807 --> 17:39.684
<i>Pretty soon my work week
was filling up.</i>

17:39.850 --> 17:42.023
<i>Mondays I had Eloise.</i>

17:42.186 --> 17:44.405
<i>Alternate Wednesdays, Christina.</i>

17:45.356 --> 17:47.825
<i>Fridays, the Birmingham Screamer.</i>

18:02.373 --> 18:04.296
- Oh, yeah!
- All right.

18:05.459 --> 18:06.676
Don't slop.

18:06.836 --> 18:09.009
- Oh, my God.
- Make it hurt.

18:13.301 --> 18:17.306
<i>So thanks to a lot of fucking,
I could finally fix up my house.</i>

18:19.974 --> 18:22.898
All right, see? This is neck massage.

18:23.060 --> 18:27.941
It goes up, it goes down. Or I can do
lower lumbar while looking out at the lake.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.656
This thing's relaxing. You try.

18:30.818 --> 18:35.244
- Come on. Give it a shot.
- No. I'm okay.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.249
Looks comfortable, though.

18:37.408 --> 18:39.706
Hey, Mom, have you
seen Dad's new vacuum cleaner?

18:39.869 --> 18:42.873
- It's like a demented dog.
- Ha, ha, it's really retarded.

18:43.372 --> 18:45.966
- And who helped you decorate?
- Nobody.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.093
I mean, ifs mostly me.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.674
And all this is...

18:52.840 --> 18:56.640
- ...from substitute teaching?
- Yeah. Mostly.

18:56.802 --> 18:59.396
And, you know, some odd jobs
here and there.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.853
Odd jobs.
Wow, what kind of odd jobs?

19:02.016 --> 19:05.520
I mean, I send my resume out 50 times
a day, nobody ever calls me back.

19:05.686 --> 19:10.533
Well, I do personal training,
for example.

19:10.691 --> 19:14.241
You know, weights and cardio. Ahem.

19:14.403 --> 19:17.873
Something sort of like that.
Hey, maybe, Jess, you ever think...

19:18.032 --> 19:20.034
about combining forces a little?

19:20.201 --> 19:22.875
You know,
so you don't have to pay rent?

19:23.037 --> 19:25.961
- He did fix the house, Mom.
- Come on.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.546
- I told you, I signed a lease.
- Okay.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.132
I know. I'm just saying.

19:31.295 --> 19:37.598
Things get too hard out there for you,
or Lottie starts driving everybody nuts...

19:37.760 --> 19:42.641
or, hey, you wanna practice your music,
or go look at the lake...

19:43.933 --> 19:47.813
I just want you to know that I'm...

19:47.978 --> 19:49.901
YOU can {IOU fit on me.

19:58.364 --> 20:00.617
"Happiness Consultants"?

20:06.997 --> 20:08.920
Can I warm you up?

20:09.083 --> 20:12.462
- Your coffee.
- Sure.

20:14.130 --> 20:15.928
You seem kind of tense. You all right?

20:17.299 --> 20:20.769
You shouldn't have more coffee.
It makes it worse.

20:23.347 --> 20:28.353
- I'm sorry, what is happening here?
- I'll tell you what, you can keep a secret.

20:28.519 --> 20:30.738
Let me just pop back
into the kitchen...

20:30.896 --> 20:33.274
I'll put a little Courvoisier
in your coffee cup.

20:33.774 --> 20:35.071
On the house.

20:40.614 --> 20:44.539
Oh! Oh, God. Oh, God. Oh, fuck.

20:44.702 --> 20:47.296
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

20:47.455 --> 20:49.799
Oh, fuck! Wait, wait.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.425
Wait, please. Wait, wait, wait.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.712
- Pull out. Oh, God.
- What? ls something wrong?

20:53.878 --> 20:55.972
No, nothing's wrong. Just pull out.

20:56.130 --> 20:57.803
- Why?
- Because I want to see it.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.967
- See what?
- Your dick.

21:00.134 --> 21:02.182
- Now?
- Yes, now.

21:02.344 --> 21:03.766
Oh, God.

21:05.723 --> 21:07.396
Oh, God. Okay.

21:07.558 --> 21:09.811
Yeah, that's a...

21:09.977 --> 21:13.026
Oh, my God. That's what I thought.

21:13.981 --> 21:15.483
Thank you.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.994
- You wanna go again?
- Again?

21:19.153 --> 21:22.783
- Yeah. Come on.
- No, sweetheart.

21:22.948 --> 21:27.954
I'm not a carnival ride.
Oh, I think I torqued my neck.

21:28.120 --> 21:31.841
Oh, I think that was the chair.

21:32.249 --> 21:36.425
Your ass is just too delicious.

21:37.505 --> 21:40.054
- What's your name?
- Jason.

21:40.216 --> 21:43.220
Jason. I'm glad I found you, Jason.

21:43.385 --> 21:48.391
I've been looking for you for a long time,
like they do in Tibet for the Dalai Lama.

22:02.488 --> 22:05.992
- What's that for?
- It's compensation.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.252
I took a discount for myself.

22:10.120 --> 22:13.875
Oh, right...
You know that I'm not like a...

22:14.041 --> 22:17.090
A whatever... Hooker dude.

22:17.253 --> 22:18.846
- Right?
- Yeah.

22:19.004 --> 22:21.803
Think of it as a gift I want to share.

22:21.966 --> 22:23.718
It's a thank-you.

22:25.970 --> 22:29.190
One time. This one time.

22:35.604 --> 22:39.154
You only have to kill one person
to be a killer, baby.

22:53.289 --> 22:56.714
- Oh, my God.
- Hey!

22:56.876 --> 23:00.506
- Wow! I'll be right down.
- Come on!

23:07.970 --> 23:09.062
Wow!

23:09.221 --> 23:11.064
Ray, what did you do?

23:11.891 --> 23:15.236
- You like it?
- It's amazing. Hell, yeah.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.692
You wanna go for a ride?

23:18.981 --> 23:20.198
Well, okay.

23:21.609 --> 23:23.862
Yeah, sure.

23:24.028 --> 23:25.871
Wow, Ray.

23:27.281 --> 23:30.785
Ray, God, it's beautiful.

23:30.951 --> 23:32.328
Mm-hm.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.755
Come on, let's go.

23:36.916 --> 23:41.296
Hey, let's go to Windsor. Let's cruise
this puppy all the way to Canada.

23:41.462 --> 23:44.762
- How about around the block?
- Oh, man.

23:45.132 --> 23:47.009
Yeah!

24:02.107 --> 24:03.734
Oh, your kids are gonna love it.

24:03.901 --> 24:06.029
You're gonna be
the best dad in the world.

24:06.195 --> 24:07.663
I hope so.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.576
You know what?

24:12.451 --> 24:15.455
Fuck around the block.
Let's see what this baby can do.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.382
Whoa!

24:31.095 --> 24:32.312
Whoa!
