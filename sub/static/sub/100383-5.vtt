00:06.000 --> 00:08.640
So, it's set in a futuristic Australia

00:08.720 --> 00:10.280
where nothing makes sense.

00:10.360 --> 00:12.480
Tank Girl's first words were
"cauliflower penis."

00:12.560 --> 00:13.560
I don't get it.

00:13.920 --> 00:15.760
You're not meant to. It's surreal.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.160
I'm really glad we're okay now.

00:29.320 --> 00:30.440
What's that noise?

00:31.600 --> 00:33.480
It's my heart.

00:39.120 --> 00:40.280
Can I kiss you?

00:49.560 --> 00:50.680
Kiss me harder.

01:04.880 --> 01:05.720
What's wrong?

01:07.440 --> 01:08.440
Where's Otis?

01:09.720 --> 01:11.080
I think I might have killed him.

01:11.160 --> 01:12.240
Uh...

01:40.000 --> 01:40.960
Turn around.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.520
Hey, Dad.

02:09.600 --> 02:12.280
Oh, hey! Great hat.

02:12.360 --> 02:15.240
Good morning, Jeanie.
All right, let's get out of here, huh?

02:15.320 --> 02:16.720
- Yeah.

02:16.800 --> 02:18.320
So, uh, where's your mate?

02:18.400 --> 02:20.400
Uh, he should be here.

02:20.480 --> 02:22.160
-You know, on time is...
-Late.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.000
-Right.
- Hey!

02:24.080 --> 02:26.040
- Hey, dude.
-Sorry, packing disaster.

02:26.120 --> 02:27.160
-All right.
-Hey, Jean.

02:27.240 --> 02:28.880
-Hi, Eric.
-What are you wearing?

02:28.960 --> 02:30.160
What are you wearing, bruv?

02:30.240 --> 02:32.760
And you've got...
Why have you got a laptop charger?

02:33.600 --> 02:36.360
-We're just going to a campsite, right?
-No, we're in a forest.

02:36.440 --> 02:37.960
We're hiking, I told you.

02:38.040 --> 02:40.160
So,
I shouldn't have worn espadrilles then?

02:40.520 --> 02:43.600
Eric, you're gonna go into the woods a boy
and you're gonna come out

02:43.680 --> 02:46.760
a man of nature. Mark my words.

02:46.840 --> 02:49.320
- Come on, let's go!
-Come on, let's hit it.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.960
-You will take care of them, won't you?
- Oh, relax, Jeanie.

02:54.040 --> 02:55.880
He is perfectly safe in my hands.

02:56.520 --> 02:57.480
Trust me.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.800
Now, let's burn some rubber.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.600
Should we play some tunes?

03:11.680 --> 03:12.640
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

03:12.720 --> 03:15.400
Come on, DJ Remi on the decks and that.
What you saying?

03:15.480 --> 03:16.560
How about this?

03:16.640 --> 03:19.920
-Awesome.

03:32.080 --> 03:34.240
Have you told Maeve
you can't see her anymore yet?

03:34.720 --> 03:36.160
Ola won't speak to me until I do.

03:38.280 --> 03:41.120
-I don't want to hurt her.
- So, who's Maeve? Hmm?

03:42.640 --> 03:43.760
-No one.
-Well, I mean--

03:43.840 --> 03:45.600
She's... she's a friend.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.160
Uh-huh.

-No, thanks.

04:20.480 --> 04:22.400

04:22.480 --> 04:23.320
It's for Jonathan.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.440

Cynthia has yet to agree to.

04:26.520 --> 04:29.120

-That's really good.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.600
I was hoping you could come.

04:39.800 --> 04:40.840
I've got work to do.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.360
Please come.

04:43.880 --> 04:45.320
I want you to see how well I'm doing.

04:52.440 --> 04:53.440

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Custard creams.

05:02.480 --> 05:04.120
Oh, hello.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.560
Hi, I'm Viv. Jackson's tutor.

05:09.360 --> 05:11.720
- Nice house.
-Hello.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.880
-Hi.
-You're studying on the weekend,

05:14.960 --> 05:16.720
that's... dedicated.

05:16.800 --> 05:19.280
-We're actually rehearsing his lines for--
-Shakespeare.

05:19.360 --> 05:23.960
Uh, Viv is helping me
with my Shakespeare essay for English.

05:24.040 --> 05:27.320
So, um, yeah.
Cool. We're gonna go study now.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.600
-You've met, right?
-We've literally just said hello.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.480
She's nice. She's really smart.

05:32.160 --> 05:33.400
What was that about?

05:33.880 --> 05:36.280
Yeah, I haven't told them
about the play yet.

05:36.360 --> 05:37.600
My mum wouldn't get it.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.640
Anyway, talk to me about Dex.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.720
-What do your friends think of him?
-I don't have time for friends,

05:47.800 --> 05:49.920
but I can be more social
once I get in to university.

05:50.000 --> 05:52.480
You do know
a boyfriend is like a friend, right?

05:52.560 --> 05:55.760
Yeah, but Dex is busy too.
Our schedules are very compatible.

05:56.560 --> 05:58.800
-Okay, all right. Tell me about him.
-Well,

05:58.880 --> 06:01.000
he's the 34th fastest Rubik's Cuber
in the world.

06:01.680 --> 06:03.440
He likes BBQ flavored Doritos.

06:03.520 --> 06:06.200
He bites his bottom lip when he thinks
about something really difficult.

06:06.280 --> 06:10.640
And he's spoken to me exactly 26 times,
using a total of 556 words.

06:11.640 --> 06:13.600
Right, okay.

06:13.680 --> 06:15.800
I meant,
what does he like to do in his spare time?

06:15.880 --> 06:19.040
Oh, he works at Pegasus Hobbies and Games

The Happy Campers Guidebook,

07:08.360 --> 07:11.320
we need to find a spot
near a source of water.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.840
No. Otis, my man,
you've gotta put that book away.

07:13.920 --> 07:18.640
You know, we've got all the information
we need right here.

07:19.080 --> 07:20.880
Do you do a lot of camping
in America, Remi?

07:20.960 --> 07:22.520
Oh, yeah. All the time.

07:22.600 --> 07:24.400
My wife Delilah and I,<i> </i>we...

07:25.120 --> 07:28.240
like to take our little boys
out of the city as much as we can.

07:29.800 --> 07:30.840
Oh. Shh, shh.

07:32.960 --> 07:35.320
-That's a nightingale.
- Where?

07:35.400 --> 07:37.600
Oh, yeah. Right, right there.

07:37.680 --> 07:39.360
-Do you see her?
-Oh. Oh.

07:40.880 --> 07:44.160
- She's so rare.
- Wow. That's, like, so pretty.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.400
- Yeah.
-Uh...

07:46.360 --> 07:47.400
I think...

07:48.200 --> 07:49.360
it's a crow.

07:52.920 --> 07:56.080
Well, this looks like
an all right place to camp.

07:56.520 --> 07:59.040
Yeah, it's got good ley lines, you know.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.480
What?

08:08.200 --> 08:09.080
Mmm.

08:09.160 --> 08:11.720
Here. Get your laughing gear
around this baby.

08:12.320 --> 08:15.560
-Keep yourself warm.
-Okay, I don't think we should drink,

08:15.640 --> 08:18.160
-whilst we hike, Dad. It's stupid.

08:18.240 --> 08:21.920
Is he always like this?
Do try and relax, Otis.

08:22.320 --> 08:24.720
-Try and relax, dude.
-I'm relaxed, shut up.

08:24.800 --> 08:27.720
-I'm relaxed.
-I think we should get our first hike in

08:28.440 --> 08:29.360
right now.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.080
Well, I mean,
we should set up the tents first.

08:32.160 --> 08:37.040
No, I think it's time we try to access
our inner wild man.

08:37.120 --> 08:38.920
- Are you with me, Eric?
-Yeah.

08:39.000 --> 08:39.880
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

08:40.280 --> 08:41.120
Good lad.

08:43.400 --> 08:45.640
I think we should get drunk with your dad.

08:45.720 --> 08:48.280
Can you smell the wild garlic, Eric?

08:48.360 --> 08:51.200
Yes, I can, Remi. Yes, I can!

08:51.280 --> 08:52.200
Good lad!

09:10.600 --> 09:11.840
Jakob!

09:12.640 --> 09:13.480
Jakob!

09:14.600 --> 09:16.720
Oh, hi. Front door was open.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.680
I'm making you a new pan shelf.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.360
I'm doing a vagina--

09:23.760 --> 09:27.640
I'm doing a vagina workshop
in a bit and I--

09:27.720 --> 09:29.400
Think you could keep it down?

09:29.840 --> 09:30.920
Yeah, sure.

09:31.360 --> 09:33.000
I'll just use my silencer.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.880
That's my James Bond impression.

09:39.200 --> 09:40.920
I promise you, won't be long.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
You ready?

09:48.480 --> 09:50.120
Ready as I'll ever be.

09:56.720 --> 09:57.640
Okay.

10:05.920 --> 10:07.440
He's looking at us.

10:07.520 --> 10:10.000
Act like I've said something really funny.

10:13.760 --> 10:15.680
Okay, too much. Too much. Reign it in.

10:17.880 --> 10:20.840
He's making his way over.
Remember what I said, all right? Be cool,

10:20.920 --> 10:23.520
-be calm, be confident.
-Bev.

10:23.600 --> 10:24.840
-Hi.
-Whoa.

10:27.160 --> 10:30.720
Honestly, don't worry about it, Bev.
It's fine. It happens all the time.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.960
You keep calling her "Bev."
Her name's actually Viv.

10:34.040 --> 10:34.920
Viv.

10:35.560 --> 10:36.560
I'm so sorry.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.800
I did know that.
I'm just terrible with names.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.600
-I didn't know you guys were--
-Friends. We're just friends.

10:42.680 --> 10:45.040
Who have casual sex sometimes.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.000
Yeah. Right? Well, uh...

10:47.640 --> 10:49.200
what can I help you with, Viv?

10:55.760 --> 10:56.840
<i>War of the Ring.</i>

10:56.920 --> 11:00.920
Oh, I love that game,
but we've just sold our last one.

11:01.000 --> 11:03.240
- Shit.
- Tell you what,

11:03.320 --> 11:05.200
maybe I could take your number down,

11:05.640 --> 11:08.160
and I can let you know
when it comes back in stock.

11:09.240 --> 11:10.080
Yeah.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.120
That's me.

11:16.240 --> 11:18.360
I'll never forget the look on their faces.

11:20.200 --> 11:21.600
Staring at me.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.960
The man who was supposed to be
their father...

11:27.240 --> 11:29.880
shitting into a plastic bag
in the middle of Hamleys.

11:30.640 --> 11:32.160
That's my biggest regret.

11:33.080 --> 11:36.080
Well, thank you for sharing, Nathan.

11:36.600 --> 11:38.720
That was... very touching.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.120
I'd like to share.

11:43.920 --> 11:45.800
-I'm Erin and I'm an addict.
- Hello.

11:46.720 --> 11:49.800
I've been clean for 13 months now.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.720
And, you know, every day is a struggle.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.360
This is my daughter, Maeve, here too.

11:56.920 --> 11:58.800
She's very angry with me,

11:59.640 --> 12:01.240
but I understand her anger,

12:01.320 --> 12:03.640
and I want her to know
it's okay to blame me

12:04.240 --> 12:06.360
because so much of her pain is my fault.

12:07.400 --> 12:11.400
But I also want her to know
that life hasn't been easy for me either.

12:11.920 --> 12:14.520
I have ended up in many bad situations
in my life,

12:16.120 --> 12:19.680
but I was just doing the best that I could
with the tools I had at the time.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.320
Maeve...

12:23.360 --> 12:26.520
I will never forgive myself
for abandoning you and your brother.

12:28.520 --> 12:29.480
And I just hope...

12:30.840 --> 12:33.160
you'll be able to find it in yourself
to forgive me.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.120
You're unbelievable.

12:45.200 --> 12:47.360
-What's wrong?
-It's all about you, isn't it, Erin?

12:48.320 --> 12:51.240
That wasn't an apology.
That was just another excuse.

12:53.080 --> 12:56.280
You don't end up in bad situations.
You make bad choices.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.520
Hey, body slammer. What you doing here?

13:05.800 --> 13:08.120
-Oh, dear.

13:10.120 --> 13:13.760
-Can you give me a hand, please?
-Why would I do that... sucker?

13:14.920 --> 13:16.560
Come on. It was pretty funny.

13:27.880 --> 13:29.160
You don't laugh much, do you?

13:29.920 --> 13:34.200
Always so serious in the face department.
Is that your <i>schtick?</i>

13:34.280 --> 13:35.360
What's this for?

13:35.760 --> 13:38.120
Well, come and have a look if you like.

13:38.720 --> 13:39.720
I'm not interested.

13:40.360 --> 13:41.880
Except you kind of are.

13:42.240 --> 13:43.240
I'm not.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.600
- Oops.

13:49.640 --> 13:53.960
Yeah, it might be easier
if you just carry them inside for me.

14:08.640 --> 14:11.880
My brother and I,
we teach this class once a week.

14:14.400 --> 14:18.080
-Where did you guys learn how to dance?
-Yeah, you know, around and about.

14:21.200 --> 14:24.400
Happened in the army.
Second tour of Afghanistan.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.400
My tank was attacked
by a pack of wild dogs.

14:28.000 --> 14:30.720
-I am lucky to be alive.
-I didn't ask.

14:30.800 --> 14:32.960
But you really, really want to.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.640
I don't feel sorry for you.

14:34.720 --> 14:36.920
-I need a partner.
-Perfect.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.000
Jerry, meet Maeve.

14:40.120 --> 14:42.280
No, I can't dance.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.720
<i>♪ Simple things ♪</i>

14:45.880 --> 14:50.480
Right. Hands <i>above </i>the hips now, Jerry.
It's not the 1960s anymore.

15:01.200 --> 15:04.800
This week's focus
is on the pleasure points

15:04.880 --> 15:06.600
inside the vagina.

15:07.120 --> 15:08.840
Now, the primary pleasure point,

15:08.920 --> 15:11.680
if you want to refer
to your leaflets, yes,

15:12.320 --> 15:13.840
is the clitoris,

15:13.920 --> 15:18.440
which can be found at the crest
of the labia majora.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.920
Behold, the clitoris.

15:22.000 --> 15:24.600
Well, it doesn't actually come out,
but, um...

15:25.560 --> 15:28.280
-Yes.
-Oh, yes, I was wondering...

15:29.200 --> 15:34.040
if your bike has been sitting
in the garden for six years,

15:34.520 --> 15:37.880
it's probably going to be quite rusty,
isn't it?

15:38.440 --> 15:41.640
Is the bike in question your vagina?

15:42.200 --> 15:43.240
Yes.

15:43.320 --> 15:45.160
What I'm asking is,

15:45.240 --> 15:48.840
if you haven't been touched
in a long time,

15:49.480 --> 15:51.640
are you still going to feel anything?

15:51.720 --> 15:56.040
I can assure you, vaginal pleasure
does not diminish with age

15:56.120 --> 15:57.920
or lack of contact.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.880
In fact, there are many ways that we--

16:07.360 --> 16:08.840
One moment, please.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.680
You said it wasn't gonna take long!

16:19.760 --> 16:21.120
Just stop!

16:22.960 --> 16:24.040
Three more screws.

16:24.120 --> 16:27.600
Look, I didn't ask for a fucking pan shelf
in the first place.

16:27.680 --> 16:29.360
My pan shelf is fine.

16:30.720 --> 16:32.600
Your pans don't fit.

16:37.320 --> 16:38.560
My pans...

16:39.480 --> 16:40.400
fit...

16:41.520 --> 16:42.400
fine.

16:53.080 --> 16:54.120
Colander.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.600
Take your hand away.

17:10.400 --> 17:13.280
This isn't about the pan shelves, is it?

17:14.400 --> 17:15.280
You...

17:16.800 --> 17:17.720
are...

17:18.880 --> 17:20.520
everywhere.

17:21.080 --> 17:23.880
Your things are everywhere.

17:24.400 --> 17:28.480
And why do you have
so much loose change, huh?

17:28.560 --> 17:32.200
I-I can't get two seconds alone
with my own thoughts because...

17:33.040 --> 17:34.680
there you are again.

17:34.760 --> 17:36.240
And there and there.

17:39.440 --> 17:41.120
We are in a relationship.

17:44.240 --> 17:45.400
I kissed Remi.

18:06.240 --> 18:07.080
See.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.360
Three more screws.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.120
Oh, shit.

18:32.320 --> 18:34.320
- All right, ladies.

18:34.960 --> 18:37.360
Could you take up
your hand mirrors, please?

18:39.280 --> 18:42.760
Come and see me afterwards.
I've got something that may help...

18:43.480 --> 18:45.680
you to get back on your bike.

18:48.760 --> 18:50.960
Guys, do you think
maybe we should head back?

18:51.040 --> 18:52.480
No, Otis. It's your go.

18:52.840 --> 18:54.960
-I don't want to play.
-Okay.

18:55.040 --> 18:57.800
Never have I ever had to choose
between my girlfriend

18:57.880 --> 18:59.880
and the girl I'm secretly in love with.

18:59.960 --> 19:01.200
Oh! Oh.

19:01.280 --> 19:04.320
Oh, is this about
the mysterious Maeve, huh?

19:04.920 --> 19:07.360
Oh, come on, Otis.
Open up to your old man.

19:08.440 --> 19:10.360
- We're friends.
- Mm-hmm.

19:10.440 --> 19:12.520
I used to like her more than that. Um...

19:13.080 --> 19:14.640
She didn't feel the same way,

19:15.040 --> 19:17.400
but now she told me
she has feelings for me.

19:18.440 --> 19:20.280
And my girlfriend kind of found out.

19:20.840 --> 19:22.400
-Uh-oh.
-So, uh...

19:23.080 --> 19:25.440
now I have to choose between...

19:26.280 --> 19:29.360
cutting Maeve out my life
or losing my girlfriend.

19:30.120 --> 19:32.680
Yeah, I was in a similar situation once.

19:32.760 --> 19:34.080
It's a difficult decision,

19:34.600 --> 19:36.160
but the heart...

19:37.480 --> 19:39.160
wants what it wants.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.240
Is that what happened with Mum?

19:44.240 --> 19:45.880
Yeah, and sometimes you...

19:47.360 --> 19:50.320
you're just with the wrong person, Otis.

19:52.520 --> 19:53.680
Uh...

19:55.760 --> 19:58.360
-Yeah, um...
-Everything all right, Dad?

19:58.920 --> 20:01.360
Yeah, just, uh, you know,
just getting my...

20:02.480 --> 20:03.400
my bearings.

20:04.280 --> 20:06.440
This is faulty. Have you got a map?

20:06.880 --> 20:07.760
Mm-hmm.

20:08.400 --> 20:11.040
Um, do you want to use my phone?

20:11.120 --> 20:13.800
No, a map is just fine.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.360
Yeah. Uh...

20:19.920 --> 20:21.000
This way.

20:21.920 --> 20:25.120
Yeah, it is definitely this way.

20:25.880 --> 20:27.840
Maybe the drinking was a bad idea.

20:36.880 --> 20:38.160
Have you ever had a weird dream?

20:41.800 --> 20:42.640
Oi!

20:44.160 --> 20:46.000
-I'm talking to you.
-I don't dream.

20:47.360 --> 20:51.320
-Everyone dreams.
-No, I've smoked too much weed.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.000
What about a sex dream?

20:54.040 --> 20:57.000
-About another guy?
-Look, I said I don't dream. Okay?

20:58.240 --> 21:01.040
I had a sex dream last night about a girl.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.960
Even though we didn't actually have sex,
we just kissed.

21:06.040 --> 21:09.960
-I just can't stop thinking about it.
-Dreams aren't real.

21:11.840 --> 21:13.720
That's why they're called dreams.

21:14.320 --> 21:17.120
Do you think it means something
if I'm having sex dreams about girls?

21:17.200 --> 21:18.280
I don't know.

21:20.120 --> 21:22.080
Go and ask Google like everyone else.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.040
You didn't answer my question before.

21:44.520 --> 21:46.040
Where'd you learn to dance?

21:46.120 --> 21:49.640
Well, we lived with this lady for a bit,

21:49.720 --> 21:52.240
ex-ballroom champion. She was horrible,

21:52.680 --> 21:54.400
but she had rhythm, so...

21:55.640 --> 21:56.840
What do you mean "for a bit"?

21:56.920 --> 22:00.080
Foster families never keep
the disabled kid around too long.

22:01.600 --> 22:03.360
Make a sad face and I will ram you.

22:05.240 --> 22:08.320
I keep seeing your mum coming in
and out of NA.

22:08.400 --> 22:09.720
She looks like a character.

22:09.800 --> 22:11.840
Yeah, well, that's none of your business.

22:13.200 --> 22:16.040
Cynthia said that she pissed off
a few years ago.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.680
-Junkies are the worst.
-She's been clean for two years.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.680
Yeah, we've all heard that one before.

22:20.760 --> 22:21.760
You don't know me...

22:22.280 --> 22:23.760
or my mum, okay?

22:23.840 --> 22:26.880
Oh, I thought we we're going to bond.
Orphan to orphan.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.200
Well, you were wrong.

22:28.960 --> 22:31.320
Hey, I didn't mean to cross a line.
I'm sorry.

22:31.400 --> 22:33.360
Maybe your mum's different. I mean...

22:33.960 --> 22:36.280
Nothing changes,
if nothing changes, right?

22:37.320 --> 22:38.480
Did you just make that up?

22:38.560 --> 22:41.280
No. That's the quote
they use on their poster.

22:42.840 --> 22:45.000
I think it should say, "Once an addict...

22:46.000 --> 22:47.160
always an addict."

22:48.920 --> 22:50.480
You're a real dick, you know?

22:54.280 --> 22:57.240
Who do you notice more when you walk
down the street? Men or women?

22:58.680 --> 22:59.520
Both.

23:00.120 --> 23:03.240
-I thought everyone did.
-Well, I only notice girls.

23:04.720 --> 23:05.720
They're everywhere.

23:06.800 --> 23:07.760
Um...

23:13.280 --> 23:14.960
I'm a pansexual, apparently.

23:15.040 --> 23:15.920
What, like...

23:16.960 --> 23:18.320
fucking pots and pans?

23:19.560 --> 23:21.200
I knew a guy who...

23:22.440 --> 23:25.960
used to like to stick his dick
in the suction pipe of a vacuum cleaner.

23:26.040 --> 23:27.160
It's normal.

23:28.360 --> 23:32.040
Pansexual means that you're attracted
to the person, not the sex or gender.

23:32.440 --> 23:35.360
Uh, it's about the connection you have
with the human being,

23:35.440 --> 23:37.080
not with their genitalia.

23:39.640 --> 23:40.560
Huh.

23:42.240 --> 23:43.880
Kind of makes sense, actually.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.320
It doesn't make sense to me.

23:52.600 --> 23:54.520
You were supposed to be here
three hours ago.

23:54.600 --> 23:56.040
Yeah, I walked.

23:56.120 --> 23:59.600
I'm really enjoying walking at the moment.
It's so evaporating.

24:00.280 --> 24:03.000
-Invigorating?
-Yeah. That's what I said.

24:16.480 --> 24:18.720
Oh, sorry. That was an accident.

24:20.240 --> 24:21.200
Okay.

24:22.480 --> 24:23.400
Ah...

24:32.240 --> 24:33.360
Do you not want me to?

24:33.840 --> 24:35.320
What makes you think I don't?

24:35.400 --> 24:39.240
-You keep slapping me in the head.
-Maybe we can watch a film or something?

24:40.720 --> 24:41.560
Yeah.

24:46.760 --> 24:48.520
Are you sure everything's okay?

24:49.080 --> 24:50.760
I feel like you've been acting
a bit strange

24:50.840 --> 24:53.360
since what happened with the bus.

24:54.040 --> 24:56.800
-Do you want to talk about it?
-I'm fine, Steve.

24:56.880 --> 24:59.680
I'm just tired from my walk.
Go and get the laptop.

26:09.160 --> 26:10.120
Ah...

26:21.880 --> 26:24.040
...there's something to be jealous of.

26:24.120 --> 26:25.960
-So, when he texts you...
-He won't text me.

26:26.040 --> 26:28.040
He will definitely text you.

26:28.120 --> 26:30.240
And you will definitely make him wait

26:30.320 --> 26:32.600
at least two and a half hours
for a response.

26:32.680 --> 26:35.560
-Why so much game playing?
-Only at the start.

26:36.120 --> 26:38.680
Eventually, you will just like each other
for your personalities.

26:38.760 --> 26:41.080
When have you ever liked anyone
for their personality?

26:42.000 --> 26:42.880
I did.

26:43.840 --> 26:45.080
I liked someone quite a lot.

26:45.160 --> 26:48.400
Yeah, I'm sure that you're pining over
Maeve Wiley's love of feminist literature.

26:48.480 --> 26:50.080
It had nothing to do with
the size of her boobs.

26:50.160 --> 26:51.360
Why are you so chippy?

26:51.840 --> 26:54.120
Because guys like you
never see girls like me.

26:54.520 --> 26:56.960
All your conquests look like
they've been made in lab.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.120
It's transparent.

26:58.960 --> 27:00.520
I really liked Maeve, you know.

27:01.080 --> 27:03.280
What was it about her
that you liked so much?

27:04.040 --> 27:05.560
It's just the feeling, isn't it?

27:06.360 --> 27:07.680
I can't really explain it.

27:09.640 --> 27:12.160
"Love looks not with the eyes,
but with the mind,

27:12.240 --> 27:15.920
and therefore,
is winged Cupid painted blind."

27:16.800 --> 27:18.880
-<i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>
-Yeah, you know.

27:18.960 --> 27:20.840
So, I've been reading his other plays.

27:21.200 --> 27:23.760
Not sure about all the pixie stuff,
but he's all right.

27:25.080 --> 27:27.600
I think you should tell your mum
that you're in a school play.

27:27.920 --> 27:29.400
She'll be really proud.

27:29.800 --> 27:32.560
Sorry, did you just give me
a compliment just then? Or--

27:32.640 --> 27:34.680
If you stop being so lazy
and learn your lines.

27:34.760 --> 27:36.200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

27:37.840 --> 27:39.000
Thank you for today.

27:40.040 --> 27:41.200
It's all right.

27:41.960 --> 27:42.800
Bye.

27:46.600 --> 27:47.560
Hey, Viv?

27:48.560 --> 27:49.440
Yeah?

27:49.960 --> 27:51.440
I <i>do </i>see you, by the way.

27:52.760 --> 27:55.560
I see a girl that gave Dex her number.

27:58.880 --> 28:00.160
See you later.

28:01.040 --> 28:02.400
Two and a half hours.

28:02.480 --> 28:03.320
Okay.

28:13.640 --> 28:16.000
Dad, we're lost, all right?

28:16.440 --> 28:18.520
We are not lost.

28:18.600 --> 28:20.320
What does the flipping map say?

28:21.520 --> 28:24.280
It says it's a cheap piece of shit.

28:25.480 --> 28:27.480
It is okay to admit we're lost.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.720
I'm not going to admit anything
because we are not lost.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.120
Guys!

28:33.840 --> 28:34.680
Guys!

28:35.160 --> 28:37.960
-Guys, I think I can see our stuff.
-Ah, you see!

28:38.040 --> 28:40.800
I told you we were not lost.

28:43.280 --> 28:46.160
Oh, my God!

28:46.720 --> 28:48.560
My hat!

28:48.640 --> 28:50.800
All right, let's just get these tents up.

28:51.720 --> 28:53.360
They are pop-up, right?

28:53.440 --> 28:57.280
Yeah, you just gotta open the bag,
and then, you just--

28:59.560 --> 29:00.840
And then it just pops up.

29:04.320 --> 29:06.280
You need to take the... strap.

29:12.880 --> 29:13.720
Dad?

29:18.480 --> 29:21.040
All right, you think you're winning?

29:21.120 --> 29:25.040
Do you? I have been through
so much worse than you.

29:25.120 --> 29:29.680
How many bloody doctorates
have you got? You...

29:30.600 --> 29:32.360
piece of fucking shit!

29:33.120 --> 29:34.880
Pop-up, my arse!

29:41.720 --> 29:43.000
Why don't we get a hotel?

29:43.080 --> 29:45.920
No, we're not getting a fucking hotel.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.440
Hey, two rooms, please...

29:51.920 --> 29:52.800
Janine.

30:20.040 --> 30:21.120
What are they for?

30:21.840 --> 30:23.200
Just felt like buying them.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.760
They're far too expensive.

30:38.120 --> 30:39.480
I want a divorce.

31:02.520 --> 31:03.480
You were right.

31:05.360 --> 31:06.960
I did make choices.

31:08.240 --> 31:09.840
And I can't take them back.

31:11.080 --> 31:14.760
And nothing you can say
will ever make me feel

31:14.840 --> 31:16.840
any worse than I already do.

31:43.400 --> 31:45.200
Can you do my nails for me, please?

31:47.840 --> 31:49.600
I haven't got all night, though, so...

32:23.640 --> 32:26.240
-Why'd you keep ignoring Rahim?
-'Cause I'm hanging with you.

32:26.320 --> 32:28.440
I don't want to be one of these people
that're suddenly obsessed

32:28.520 --> 32:31.520
-with who they're dating.
-Well, that's very sweet, Eric,

32:31.600 --> 32:35.000
but why are you ignoring him?
Didn't he ask you to be his boyfriend?

32:36.960 --> 32:38.800
Okay.

32:44.800 --> 32:46.280
I have to tell you something.

32:47.400 --> 32:50.120
Okay? But you can't be mad
I didn't say anything before.

32:53.440 --> 32:56.320
Do you remember
I got detention last term with Adam?

32:59.480 --> 33:00.360
Well...

33:01.040 --> 33:03.120
he gave me a blowjob.

33:05.480 --> 33:08.440
And since he's been back, we've been
going on all these late-night walks

33:08.520 --> 33:11.360
where we go and smash stuff
and then we kiss...

33:11.840 --> 33:15.120
a lot and... and it's amazing.

33:17.080 --> 33:18.680
Why is your face not moving?

33:18.760 --> 33:21.640
Because he... he bullied you...

33:22.080 --> 33:25.480
-for years, Eric. He's a horrible person.
-No, but people can change.

33:25.560 --> 33:28.480
If he's changed, then why is he making you
sneak around at night?

33:28.560 --> 33:29.880
Well, it's romantic.

33:31.800 --> 33:34.000
Something you wouldn't know about
because you're too busy

33:34.080 --> 33:35.960
pretending to have feelings
for your girlfriend,

33:36.040 --> 33:38.360
when everyone knows
that you're actually in love with Maeve.

33:38.440 --> 33:40.400
-No, take that back.
-You take back what you said.

33:41.240 --> 33:42.440
-What about Rahim?
-Oh, my God.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.360
He's not ashamed to be with you.

33:44.440 --> 33:47.360
-Don't pretend to be all "Team Rahim" now.
-What's that supposed to mean?

33:47.440 --> 33:49.440
I think that that is what this
is really about.

33:49.520 --> 33:51.880
You don't like being
the one left behind for a change.

33:51.960 --> 33:55.560
No, Eric. This is about you
being so self-hating

33:55.640 --> 33:59.360
that you'd let yourself fall for someone
who literally treats you like shit.

33:59.440 --> 34:01.840
Don't therapize me, Otis.

34:01.920 --> 34:03.480
You don't know what my reality is.

34:03.560 --> 34:04.400
Okay.

34:04.960 --> 34:05.920
Do what you want.

34:07.000 --> 34:07.920
Okay? But...

34:08.880 --> 34:12.080
ask yourself...
why have you really been hiding it?

34:14.240 --> 34:17.880
Why, Delilah? Don't! Don't hang up!

34:17.960 --> 34:19.680
-Argh!

34:20.680 --> 34:23.440
-I've gotta go check on my dad.
-Yeah, we'll talk later.

34:33.960 --> 34:35.960
Fuck.

34:39.360 --> 34:40.200
Yeah?

34:50.360 --> 34:51.400
You all right, Dad?

34:51.480 --> 34:53.280
Yeah, Delilah has, uh...

34:55.040 --> 34:55.920
has left me...

34:56.640 --> 34:57.560
for someone else.

34:59.640 --> 35:00.560
Oh, shit.

35:08.560 --> 35:09.480
I'm sorry.

35:11.200 --> 35:12.560
Are you upset by that?

35:15.440 --> 35:16.280
Yeah.

35:17.160 --> 35:18.000
Yeah, um...

35:18.720 --> 35:20.600
I'm upset for you.

35:22.560 --> 35:24.440
'Cause it's...

35:25.440 --> 35:26.480
it's okay...

35:28.240 --> 35:29.680
if you want to cry, Otis.

35:31.120 --> 35:32.000
I mean...

35:32.400 --> 35:35.200
-Yeah, I will. I'm good.
-Yeah, you know, it's...

35:36.600 --> 35:37.640
it's all right...

35:39.240 --> 35:40.440
for men to cry.

35:41.360 --> 35:42.520
-I know.
-Yeah.

35:48.840 --> 35:49.960
Oh, God.

35:58.880 --> 35:59.800
It's...

36:13.400 --> 36:14.240
What's wrong?

36:16.040 --> 36:17.240
I'm going to kiss you.

36:32.040 --> 36:33.400
Why are we at school?

36:35.320 --> 36:36.560
We're always at school.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.080
Where's Otis?

36:44.440 --> 36:46.760
Don't worry... he's with Maeve.

36:47.840 --> 36:48.680
You're safe.

37:28.320 --> 37:29.520
Jean speaking.

37:29.600 --> 37:32.360
<i>Hi, Jean. It's Delilah.</i> <i>Is Remi there?</i>

37:32.440 --> 37:34.160
Remi's with Otis, Delilah.

37:35.560 --> 37:36.560
Can I help?

37:37.320 --> 37:39.720
<i>Um, yeah,</i>
<i>can you get him to give me a call?</i>

37:39.800 --> 37:42.400
<i>We need to arrange a time for him</i>
<i>to come and get his things.</i>

37:43.520 --> 37:45.080
<i>You were right after all, Jean.</i>

37:45.600 --> 37:47.760
<i>-I couldn't change him either.</i>

37:48.640 --> 37:49.520
Yes.

37:50.120 --> 37:51.800
I'll give him the message.

38:22.200 --> 38:24.720
Don't go. Don't go.

38:29.080 --> 38:30.040
Go.

38:36.600 --> 38:37.440
Morning.

38:39.720 --> 38:42.600
Delilah didn't leave you
for someone else, did she?

38:46.000 --> 38:47.480
You cheated again.

38:49.800 --> 38:52.080
And you came here
'cause you had nowhere else to go.

38:53.080 --> 38:56.840
Quick! Quick! Come here, Otis, Remi!

39:00.040 --> 39:00.960
Come, man!

39:02.480 --> 39:05.560
Good thing for insurance, eh?

39:08.120 --> 39:09.880
You did get insurance, didn't you?

39:16.440 --> 39:18.760
-I don't think he got insurance.

I just wish you'd told me.

40:35.360 --> 40:37.240

41:50.480 --> 41:52.320
-How was it?
- Great.

41:52.400 --> 41:54.840
Great. We saw a nightingale.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.080
Oh.

41:56.600 --> 41:59.160
And it rained, and we got lost.

Dad fought a tent like it was a person.

42:04.800 --> 42:06.480

You know I'm a sex addict, Jean.

45:13.920 --> 45:15.600
I'm going to get help this time.

45:18.720 --> 45:20.200
I want to be a good father.

45:20.280 --> 45:21.320
Mmm.

45:29.000 --> 45:29.880
Um...

45:29.960 --> 45:31.680
I might take your hand, actually.

45:32.720 --> 45:34.840
No, wait. No. That feels weird. Sorry.

45:36.080 --> 45:38.000
Okay. Here goes.

45:49.400 --> 45:50.240
I love you.

45:56.000 --> 45:59.600
Uh... I said... I love you.
Why are you laughing?

46:02.440 --> 46:03.320
Because...

46:05.040 --> 46:06.520
...you don't love me.

46:07.840 --> 46:11.560
And I've just realized
that I definitely don't love you.

46:12.320 --> 46:14.360
I think we got it wrong.

46:14.680 --> 46:16.800
I think we're supposed to be friends.

46:17.240 --> 46:18.120
What?

46:19.120 --> 46:21.160
We're so different, you know.

46:21.760 --> 46:23.800
I like to be in the moment
and you're so...

46:24.760 --> 46:25.800
uptight.

46:26.720 --> 46:29.600
You said you had to think about it,
and it was difficult.

46:30.200 --> 46:32.960
It shouldn't be difficult, Otis. We're 16.

46:33.040 --> 46:34.600
Are you breaking up with me?

46:37.000 --> 46:37.840
Yeah.

46:38.640 --> 46:39.480
I am.

46:46.160 --> 46:48.160
Ah, ah...

46:49.640 --> 46:51.880
Okay, um, actually, just...

46:52.880 --> 46:53.720
please go.

46:54.800 --> 46:55.680
Okay.

47:01.480 --> 47:02.880
I'm really sorry, Otis.

47:16.760 --> 47:17.680
Fuck.

47:35.560 --> 47:36.600
Rahim.

47:43.040 --> 47:45.320
So, have you decided
not to ignore me anymore?

47:47.280 --> 47:48.160
Sorry.

47:49.320 --> 47:52.640
I had some stuff
that I needed to think about.

47:54.200 --> 47:55.960
This is all new for me.

47:59.520 --> 48:00.440
Uh...

48:02.240 --> 48:04.000
Would you like to be my boyfriend?

48:09.760 --> 48:10.760
I asked you first.

48:13.400 --> 48:14.640
Yes.

48:15.320 --> 48:17.640
I would like to be your boyfriend, Rahim.

48:24.720 --> 48:26.040
