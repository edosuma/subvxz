00:19.631 --> 00:20.838
(Connor) Hold on.

00:20.839 --> 00:22.239
(Sarah & Abby complains)

00:22.254 --> 00:24.318
- (Abby) Danny!
- (Sarah) What are you doing?

00:27.339 --> 00:28.932
Was that really necessary?

00:29.060 --> 00:30.421
My car. My rules.

00:30.549 --> 00:34.124
- I hate it when you pull rank.
- I hate sitting in the back.

00:34.336 --> 00:37.315
- You sat in front last time.
- Who keeps count?

00:37.464 --> 00:38.962
Connor does.

00:39.513 --> 00:40.913
(Watchman knocks the window and shouts)

00:41.226 --> 00:41.974
(Watchman)
Oi! You lot!

00:42.094 --> 00:45.083
- (Connor) Friendly round here.
- (Watchman) You can't go in there!

00:51.642 --> 00:53.600
So where's this anomaly?

00:54.802 --> 00:56.538
(Danny) The anomaly?

01:07.836 --> 01:09.480
(Connor) It's in that garage.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.266
- (Danny) Seen anything unusual?
- (Man) No.

01:11.386 --> 01:13.037
You'd think
someone would have noticed.

01:14.790 --> 01:16.760
(Connor)
He's in here somewhere.

01:17.435 --> 01:20.400
(Danny) Right. Let's split up
and find him.

01:24.227 --> 01:25.894
(Becker) I'd evacuate
the immediate area...

01:26.014 --> 01:27.841
...till we know
what we're dealing with.

01:28.900 --> 01:30.364
Guys.

01:30.692 --> 01:32.513
It's here.

01:45.814 --> 01:47.814
(Abby steps on a runny thing)

01:57.759 --> 02:00.543
- What is it?
- Some kind of animal secretion.

02:00.679 --> 02:03.165
- Creature incursion.
- What kind of creature?

02:03.462 --> 02:05.658
One that excretes goo.

02:06.407 --> 02:07.320
(Abby) Right...

02:08.500 --> 02:09.872
It's reassuring.

02:10.348 --> 02:12.579
Let's find it.
Be careful though.

02:34.580 --> 02:36.080
(Coin clinks)

02:51.081 --> 02:52.181
(Some creature sounds)

02:52.182 --> 02:54.382
(Steps from the top)

03:12.085 --> 03:14.085
(Vermin scatters and splashes)

03:18.086 --> 03:18.960
Nice.

03:46.434 --> 03:50.434
Season 3 - Episode 8

03:53.977 --> 03:55.977
(People chattering around)

03:58.208 --> 04:00.778
- I don't like insects.
- It's all right now.

04:01.152 --> 04:04.386
No. I really,
really don't like insects.

04:04.608 --> 04:06.301
Any idea?

04:07.025 --> 04:08.894
I'll have to do a full autopsy.

04:09.050 --> 04:10.821
I think it's some kind of ant.

04:10.956 --> 04:12.703
You know,
in most fights with ants...

04:12.704 --> 04:16.199
...I'd fancy my chances, but this!
This is a serious ant.

04:16.399 --> 04:17.399
(Danny) Connor?

04:18.007 --> 04:19.795
Nothing like it
in the fossil records.

04:20.101 --> 04:23.267
Whatever it is or was I don't want
another one coming through the anomaly.

04:23.489 --> 04:24.731
I'm on it.

04:32.975 --> 04:35.341
Oi. What are you doing?
That's my job.

04:35.512 --> 04:38.644
You're not the only one
who can press a few buttons.

04:40.848 --> 04:42.652
I think you'll find it's
a bit more complicated than that.

04:42.772 --> 04:43.821
Really?

04:44.222 --> 04:45.922
(Sarah pushes some buttons on the apparatus)

04:50.023 --> 04:51.742
There you go.

04:52.457 --> 04:54.142
- Beginner's luck.
- Maybe.

04:54.495 --> 04:58.495
But I didn't want to risk
any more of those things.

04:59.057 --> 05:01.150
Listen, you don't have to feel bad.

05:01.321 --> 05:04.997
Me? Terrified of being trapped
in a shopping centre...

05:05.542 --> 05:07.278
...with brain-eating zombies.

05:07.823 --> 05:09.525
Eek!
Can you imagine?

05:10.199 --> 05:13.280
But that's unlikely to happen,
isn't it, Connor?

05:13.553 --> 05:16.463
I'm trying to work with you, woman.
Help me out.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.083
Seriously, you're fine.

05:20.219 --> 05:22.614
You're safe.
Nothing's coming through there.

05:22.740 --> 05:23.540
OK.

05:23.584 --> 05:25.473
Don't worry.

05:28.474 --> 05:30.174
(Danny) Connor! Sarah!

05:31.856 --> 05:33.167
(Danny) Come on, guys.

05:40.577 --> 05:42.841
- (Abby) Everything OK?
- Fine. Yeah.

05:45.105 --> 05:48.184
- (Abby) Have you been in my bag?
- I thought I heard your phone ring.

05:48.796 --> 05:51.775
(Abby) It's my stuff.
Keep out.

05:59.398 --> 06:01.800
Weird-looking phone.

06:02.342 --> 06:03.619
It's a satnav.

06:03.959 --> 06:06.287
- For work.
- Right.

06:06.576 --> 06:10.277
So you can get from the penguins
to the puffins without getting lost.

06:11.187 --> 06:14.336
Yeah.
Something like that.

06:22.585 --> 06:25.385
<i>(Voice on tape in a foreign language)</i>

06:27.486 --> 06:30.786
(Lester speaks in a foreign language)

06:31.787 --> 06:34.887
(Lester speaks in a foreign language)
(fading)

06:37.786 --> 06:39.702
"Bluff Your Way
in Mandarin!"

06:40.995 --> 06:43.971
(Lester) I'm going to a private reception
with the Chinese ambassador.

06:44.244 --> 06:44.960
Cool.

06:45.486 --> 06:47.315
(Connor)
Can I be your plus one?

06:51.189 --> 06:52.449
I'll take that as a no.

06:52.755 --> 06:56.755
I wouldn't know what to eat anyway
without the numbers on the menu.

06:57.359 --> 06:59.912
(Lester) Have you seen my invitation?
It was here on the table.

07:02.516 --> 07:04.490
I said,
"Have you seen my invitation?"

07:04.635 --> 07:06.201
It was just here.

07:06.626 --> 07:08.478
Maybe it's in your jacket.

07:13.642 --> 07:16.331
Nancy! Give me that.
Give me that. (Nancy snarls)

07:16.774 --> 07:18.136
I can't find my jacket now.

07:21.543 --> 07:22.543
(Nancy squeaks)

07:22.544 --> 07:24.314
- What's that noise?
- What noise?

07:25.403 --> 07:27.105
A squeaking noise.
(Nancy squeaks again)

07:28.118 --> 07:29.837
Can't hear anything.

07:35.792 --> 07:37.290
Drop it.

07:47.350 --> 07:49.427
- (Sentry#1) What are you gonna do?
- (Sentry#2) Twist.

07:50.584 --> 07:52.079
Seven.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.680
(Strange noises from the other side)

08:01.140 --> 08:03.140
(Some creature moves behind the truck)

08:03.741 --> 08:05.341
Come on.

08:15.520 --> 08:17.480
(Sentry#2) What's that?

08:24.611 --> 08:26.432
I'd better report this.

08:33.832 --> 08:35.832
(Vermin snarls from the top of the truck)

08:40.034 --> 08:42.034
(Sentry#2 screams)

08:44.535 --> 08:46.535
(Sentry#2 screams but ends fadingly)

08:57.536 --> 08:59.536
(Vermin attacks from the other side)

09:19.759 --> 09:21.325
(Abby) See you later, Jack.

09:22.380 --> 09:24.575
What's happening at the zoo today?

09:25.492 --> 09:26.965
- The usual.
- What's the usual?

09:27.101 --> 09:29.586
- You never talk about it.
- Later.

09:33.587 --> 09:36.587
(Anomaly detector beeps)

09:45.663 --> 09:46.663
What?

09:48.709 --> 09:50.479
Don't look at me like that.

09:50.683 --> 09:53.100
It fell out... sort of.

09:55.671 --> 09:57.680
This is a conspiracy, isn't it?

09:59.995 --> 10:02.262
You two are in this together.

10:03.528 --> 10:06.101
Tell me what she's up to
or I take it.

10:07.426 --> 10:09.366
Don't say
I didn't give you a chance.

10:14.842 --> 10:17.786
- (Connor) What do you think?
- (Danny) Fantastic. What is it?

10:17.974 --> 10:21.861
(Connor) This is my calibrated
laser refractor.

10:22.015 --> 10:24.466
- (Danny) Come again?
- It's a mechanical arm...

10:24.602 --> 10:27.887
...that rotates the artefact
through every angle in the spectrum.

10:28.432 --> 10:32.045
And sooner or later
the angles are aligned perfectly...

10:32.215 --> 10:35.061
- ...and it'll reproduce
the hologram. - OK, well...

10:35.199 --> 10:37.261
Let's get on with it then.

10:37.566 --> 10:39.702
OK. Cool.

10:52.394 --> 10:54.624
- Is that it?
- That's it.

10:55.543 --> 10:57.433
It's actually quite boring.

10:58.284 --> 11:01.892
So it's not the most exciting thing
in the world, but it will work.

11:03.102 --> 11:06.982
Then I'll finally be able
to finish the work Cutter started.

11:09.990 --> 11:11.342
I wonder
what Abby's up to.

11:12.049 --> 11:13.428
I've got more to -

11:35.672 --> 11:36.672
(Watchman exclaims)

11:36.673 --> 11:39.175
Clear off. Go on.

11:59.703 --> 12:00.878
Right.

12:01.048 --> 12:03.609
The insect creature
is derived from Hymenoptera,

12:03.950 --> 12:06.622
the same family as ants,
bees, sawflies, and wasps.

12:07.116 --> 12:09.891
So this thing can sting?

12:10.112 --> 12:13.806
In this case the sting
has evolved into an ovipositor.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.785
That's a relief. Isn't it?

12:18.385 --> 12:21.582
It uses it
to lay eggs inside a host.

12:22.545 --> 12:25.033
Human beings would do very nicely.

12:25.169 --> 12:26.123
That's rank.

12:26.327 --> 12:28.643
- Nasty.
- There was something else.

12:29.136 --> 12:31.604
I found very
high levels of selenium in it.

12:31.962 --> 12:34.100
(Abby) It's a chemical like sulphur.

12:34.884 --> 12:38.254
That's weird
'cos when I cleaned the artefact...

12:38.390 --> 12:41.233
...the dirt was registering
high levels of selenium as well.

12:44.075 --> 12:46.283
You say that bug is from
the same place of artefact.

12:46.412 --> 12:47.320
It's possible.

12:47.543 --> 12:49.824
Then the artefact
is from the future, right?

12:50.725 --> 12:51.625
Yeah.

12:51.632 --> 12:55.632
Which means that the future could
be just the other side of the anomaly.

12:57.001 --> 12:59.018
You finish up here.

12:59.703 --> 13:01.935
(Danny) Give Becker's men a call.
Tell them we're on our way.

13:02.686 --> 13:03.686
OK.

13:10.287 --> 13:12.287
(Anomaly detector beeps)

13:35.288 --> 13:37.288
(Cellphone rings outside)

13:53.474 --> 13:54.474
(Jack) Connor?

13:56.775 --> 13:57.775
Jack...

13:58.275 --> 13:59.875
<i>(Connor's voice)
Now I'm confused...</i>

14:00.931 --> 14:03.637
- What are you doing on this phone?
- You don't work at a zoo.

14:03.961 --> 14:05.653
<i>(Jake)
You work in motor racing?</i>

14:05.773 --> 14:07.790
Abby, you could have told me!
I am your brother.

14:08.304 --> 14:12.304
- You stole my detector.
- Will serve you right for lying to me?

14:14.619 --> 14:16.049
(Jack) What's that?

14:16.968 --> 14:18.462
(Jack) Hold on.

14:19.674 --> 14:21.666
- Oh, my God! They're dead.
- Dead?

14:22.904 --> 14:24.036
<i>(Abby) Who's dead?</i>

14:24.611 --> 14:26.070
<i>(Abby) Jack, calm down.</i>

14:26.296 --> 14:28.066
<i>(Abby) Tell me what's happening.</i>

15:49.367 --> 15:50.367
(Something crackles behind)

15:50.368 --> 15:52.368
(Jack screams)
(Fading)

16:01.121 --> 16:02.840
(Sarah)
There's no sign of him.

16:05.809 --> 16:08.141
He's gone through the anomaly.

16:08.498 --> 16:11.690
- (Abby) I have to find him.
- Abby, I'm sure he's OK.

16:12.918 --> 16:15.312
- What was he doing here, anyway?
- I don't know.

16:16.265 --> 16:17.899
He stole my detector.

16:18.052 --> 16:20.518
It's your responsibility to keep
that safe. What've you doing?

16:20.638 --> 16:22.748
He went in my bag.

16:22.902 --> 16:25.000
- This will take time to fix.
- What happened?

16:25.342 --> 16:26.925
It's been run over by a car.

16:28.627 --> 16:30.998
We'll get him back, OK?
I promise.

16:31.118 --> 16:34.097
- Connor, stay here and get that fixed.
- No. I'll stay with Abby.

16:34.761 --> 16:37.382
I can probably figure
all of this out.

16:37.552 --> 16:40.463
The backup's on the truck.
It needs resetting and synchronising.

16:40.764 --> 16:42.973
- Come on.
- This isn't some school trip!

16:43.093 --> 16:45.221
We gotta wait for backup.

16:45.663 --> 16:47.604
You wait if you want.

16:53.494 --> 16:55.101
- You all right?
- Yeah.

17:00.841 --> 17:02.379
(Becker)
Don't step backwards.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.781
(Danny) Where are we?

17:30.519 --> 17:31.881
The future.

17:32.340 --> 17:33.753
Our future?

17:34.451 --> 17:36.409
How many years away?

17:37.021 --> 17:39.175
I don't know.
It's hard to say.

17:43.043 --> 17:44.149
Look at these cars.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.975
(Danny) They could have been there
for centuries.

17:47.129 --> 17:48.495
Or maybe not.

17:49.312 --> 17:52.183
(Danny) Look, all we have to do
is find the kid...

17:52.359 --> 17:53.562
...and get out of here.

17:54.027 --> 17:56.854
What's happened in this place?
Where is everyone?

17:57.102 --> 17:59.630
Concentrate on the job.
He can't have gone far.

17:59.766 --> 18:01.223
Unless he spooked.

18:01.422 --> 18:04.247
He'll be somewhere nearby.
He's not an idiot.

18:04.809 --> 18:05.864
Well...

18:10.351 --> 18:12.410
Look. There.

18:12.802 --> 18:13.720
(Abby) The car!

18:24.521 --> 18:26.521
(Rattles and voices around)

18:44.469 --> 18:45.694
Up there.

18:55.248 --> 18:56.457
Come on, guys.

19:06.777 --> 19:07.900
Well done!

19:08.036 --> 19:10.790
You've just alerted
every predator for miles.

19:10.910 --> 19:13.532
I didn't have much choice,
did I, Abigail?

19:14.468 --> 19:17.041
- What are you talking about?
- Predators. They're...

19:17.263 --> 19:19.501
We don't know
how they evolved or when, but...

19:19.922 --> 19:20.828
...we know they're intelligent,

19:20.829 --> 19:23.549
we know they're quick,
and really mean.

19:25.132 --> 19:27.216
It's a case
of we kill them or they kill us.

19:27.590 --> 19:28.780
Why are we whispering?

19:28.900 --> 19:31.555
They locate their prey
using echolocation.

19:32.202 --> 19:34.892
- They see sound.
- Great.

19:37.378 --> 19:38.640
If those things got loose,

19:40.018 --> 19:42.196
humanity never stood a chance.

19:47.269 --> 19:48.324
(Connor) That's it!

19:48.477 --> 19:50.499
We go back.
We need backup.

19:50.703 --> 19:52.456
He could be injured.

19:53.069 --> 19:55.960
We can't leave him here
with those creatures.

19:56.148 --> 19:58.514
It's her brother.
We stay.

20:00.131 --> 20:02.920
You're supposed to make
the tough decisions, Danny.

20:03.312 --> 20:04.725
I just did.

20:05.150 --> 20:07.159
And you,
you calm down.

20:08.129 --> 20:10.461
- (Danny) You await my signal.
- OK.

20:17.629 --> 20:19.824
You do know he's almost certainly
dead, don't you?

20:20.369 --> 20:22.257
She needs to find out herself.

20:22.410 --> 20:24.793
In her shoes,
I'd feel exactly the same way.

20:25.815 --> 20:27.340
(Danny) Let's do this.

20:35.769 --> 20:36.858
Right.

20:43.559 --> 20:45.559
(Creature squeaks in the car)

20:57.760 --> 20:59.760
(Danny gasps)

21:00.435 --> 21:03.197
- And that was a baby,
right? - Yeah.

21:06.414 --> 21:07.438
This is insanity.

21:12.153 --> 21:13.679
(Connor)
Let me see.

21:14.919 --> 21:15.719
Sorry.

21:15.839 --> 21:17.473
(Connor)
I don't think it's too deep.

21:24.881 --> 21:26.021
(Connor) Where's Abby?

21:32.501 --> 21:33.948
Quick. Get in!

21:42.408 --> 21:44.673
Let me tell you this
one more time.

21:44.797 --> 21:47.674
Getting ourselves killed
will not help your brother!

21:48.443 --> 21:50.945
We need a fully armed
search and rescue unit.

21:52.108 --> 21:53.708
Having more firepower gives...

21:53.709 --> 21:56.108
...a better chance of saving
your brother. It is a fact.

21:57.733 --> 21:59.367
Danny's right.

21:59.997 --> 22:02.635
- You, too?
- I'm just trying to be sensible.

22:02.771 --> 22:04.658
You've always hated him,
haven't you?

22:06.922 --> 22:09.152
You'd be happy
if he was dead.

22:18.153 --> 22:19.153
(Door opens)

22:19.154 --> 22:21.154
(Ceature roars)

22:37.985 --> 22:39.517
Oi! You!

22:45.342 --> 22:46.398
Go.

22:59.490 --> 23:00.490
(Becker exhales)

23:00.491 --> 23:02.568
Next time
don't leave it so long.

23:41.408 --> 23:42.908
Help!

23:44.240 --> 23:46.862
Help. Somebody, help!

23:50.333 --> 23:51.833
Help!

23:56.234 --> 23:58.234
(Some creature approaches)

24:18.651 --> 24:21.922
- I didn't ask for your help.
- (Danny) Well, you've got it.

24:23.382 --> 24:25.092
He's the only family
I've got.

24:26.462 --> 24:28.359
(Abby)
I have to help him.

24:28.870 --> 24:30.165
Listen, I'll make you a deal.

24:30.285 --> 24:31.883
We go to the car.
If Jack's there, great.

24:32.003 --> 24:35.033
If not, we go back,
get support and start again.

24:35.255 --> 24:37.604
I will not give up on him,
I promise.

24:38.872 --> 24:39.961
OK.

24:46.162 --> 24:48.162
(Another maggot approaches)

24:51.563 --> 24:53.563
(Jack groans)

25:12.581 --> 25:14.337
(Danny)
Is Jack in the car?

25:15.028 --> 25:16.128
No.

25:21.097 --> 25:22.408
<i>(Jack, from a distance)
Help!</i>

25:23.009 --> 25:24.009
(Jack groans)

25:30.323 --> 25:31.531
<i>(Jack, from a distance)
Help!</i>

25:37.030 --> 25:37.732
Listen.

25:37.733 --> 25:39.839
<i>(Jack, from downstairs)
Help! Help!</i>

25:39.840 --> 25:42.969
(Abby exhales)
- Yes! It's Jack.

25:44.058 --> 25:45.811
<i>(Jack)
I'm down here.</i>

25:46.237 --> 25:47.696
<i>(Jack)
Is anyone there?</i>

25:52.872 --> 25:55.265
Jack, you have to keep quiet.

25:55.443 --> 25:59.069
You've got to get me out of here.
There's things disgusting.

25:59.217 --> 26:00.717
What are they?

26:01.057 --> 26:03.032
<i>(Jack)
Horrible and slimey.</i>

26:03.239 --> 26:04.178
<i>(Jack) They sting.</i>

26:04.179 --> 26:05.588
He's OK.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.595
Guys.

26:14.203 --> 26:16.409
I'm going to go down.
You stay with them, right?

26:16.613 --> 26:18.650
OK. Thank you.

26:26.625 --> 26:28.762
(Jack) Who are you?
You've got to get me out of here.

26:28.882 --> 26:32.265
- I need you to stay calm.
- (Jack) How am I supposed to stay calm?

26:32.385 --> 26:34.948
- (Danny) Get over here.
- I can't. My leg's trapped.

26:37.559 --> 26:40.240
- It stinks of paraffin.
- (Jack) Who cares what it smells like?

26:44.112 --> 26:45.637
What is that?

26:46.604 --> 26:48.098
(Jack) It's a kind of maggot.

26:56.110 --> 26:57.654
Let me see that leg.

26:59.165 --> 27:00.165
(Jack cries out)

27:02.890 --> 27:05.065
- We're gonna do this together.
Count of three. Yeah? - Yeah.

27:05.473 --> 27:07.815
One, two, three.

27:18.595 --> 27:20.258
Jack's down there.

27:21.463 --> 27:23.726
(Danny) We have to climb.
All right?

27:23.861 --> 27:25.287
(Jack)
What's happening to me?

27:25.414 --> 27:27.808
- (Danny) Just shut up and climb.
- (Jack) I don't think I can.

27:27.960 --> 27:30.162
- It's my arm.
- (Danny) What?

27:30.485 --> 27:33.085
(Jack) I think I've broken it.
My ribs hurt.

27:33.696 --> 27:35.869
Connor, we're gonna need a rope.

27:36.165 --> 27:37.265
(Abby) OK.

27:51.218 --> 27:52.541
(Danny) This is gonna hurt.

27:52.693 --> 27:54.477
(Danny) I suggest,
if you wanna live,

27:54.687 --> 27:56.389
you keep quiet, all right?

27:57.140 --> 27:58.396
OK.
Take him up.

28:15.366 --> 28:16.367
Becker.

28:18.642 --> 28:20.797
- (Connor) I can't hold it.
- (Becker) Take the gun.

28:21.298 --> 28:23.298
(Creatures surround)

28:31.499 --> 28:33.499
(Vermin coming from downstairs)

28:37.068 --> 28:38.918
Connor, get him out of here.

28:42.919 --> 28:45.919
(Lots of ceatures roars)

28:49.281 --> 28:51.623
- Guys.
- (Becker) Get him up here.

29:04.956 --> 29:08.570
Whatever happens
just get them out of here.

29:08.921 --> 29:10.771
Good luck.

29:15.572 --> 29:17.326
(Gun shots sound from outside)

29:17.327 --> 29:19.948
- What's going on?
- (Becker) Come on!

29:26.949 --> 29:28.949
(Gun shots)

29:28.950 --> 29:29.950
(Vermin climbs up)

29:43.759 --> 29:45.688
- Don't leave me here.
- (Danny) Just hang tight.

29:45.891 --> 29:47.419
You coward!

29:52.400 --> 29:53.568
Have you got him?

30:00.966 --> 30:02.867
- Abby!
- (Abby) Come on!

30:04.785 --> 30:06.737
(Danny) Get him out of here.
There's something coming up.

30:06.890 --> 30:08.247
- Run!
- (Connor) What is it?

30:08.612 --> 30:10.733
Trust me,
you don't want to know.

30:11.039 --> 30:12.139
(Danny) Go!

30:12.456 --> 30:13.322
(Connor) Let's go!

30:47.749 --> 30:50.346
Come on. Let's go!
Come on!

30:57.745 --> 30:59.697
(Danny)
Come here! Get in.

31:01.750 --> 31:03.817
Be quiet.
Especially you.

31:17.306 --> 31:19.200
That should do it.

31:19.420 --> 31:21.308
I hope.

31:31.083 --> 31:32.832
Genius, Sarah.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.868
Becker?

31:46.697 --> 31:48.208
(Connor)
He tried to save us.

31:52.077 --> 31:53.656
Are you OK?

31:53.911 --> 31:55.218
I'm in agony.

31:55.642 --> 31:57.520
(Jack) If you'd told me the truth,
I wouldn't be here.

31:57.679 --> 31:59.122
(Jack) Where are we?

31:59.292 --> 32:02.200
How come it took you
so long to get here?

32:02.776 --> 32:03.930
I was terrified.

32:04.066 --> 32:07.325
Becker sacrificed himself to save
you, and that's all you can say?

32:09.337 --> 32:11.510
- Keep that kid away from me.
- Who's Becker?

32:11.951 --> 32:14.515
The man who took on
a pack of killers to save you.

32:14.896 --> 32:16.806
- So?
- (Abby) So?!

32:17.018 --> 32:19.118
So what?

32:19.802 --> 32:22.040
He's dead,
and it's your fault!

32:22.662 --> 32:24.788
You stupid, selfish -

32:28.708 --> 32:30.601
I thought you were dead.

32:30.748 --> 32:32.302
Come here.

32:32.454 --> 32:33.643
(Jack) Sorry.

32:34.465 --> 32:35.975
(Jack) I'm sorry.

32:42.305 --> 32:44.108
Can we go home?

32:44.970 --> 32:46.378
That might be the tricky part.

32:48.029 --> 32:51.029
(Clumps from the top of the bus)

32:52.755 --> 32:54.188
Get down.

32:55.606 --> 32:56.828
Get down.

33:36.308 --> 33:38.387
Here are our options.

33:38.751 --> 33:42.030
We try and make a run for it,
and they tear us to bits.

33:42.570 --> 33:45.082
We hold out here
as long as we can.

33:46.204 --> 33:48.308
And they tear us to bits.

33:51.100 --> 33:53.400
I never said
they were good options.

33:57.594 --> 33:59.190
This is it.

34:02.391 --> 34:05.391
(Creatures roar and jolt the bus)

34:16.319 --> 34:18.815
- What's going on?
- It's the fire.

34:18.985 --> 34:22.359
(Danny) It's smoking them out.
That'll keep them busy.

34:22.583 --> 34:24.791
We've got a chance.
We're gonna go now.

34:26.087 --> 34:27.891
(Abby) OK, go!

34:28.592 --> 34:31.068
(Danny) Don't stop
till you get to the anomaly.

34:31.376 --> 34:33.056
Whatever happens don't stop.

35:05.255 --> 35:06.668
Danny!

35:07.343 --> 35:08.497
Move!

35:17.187 --> 35:18.287
Go!

35:28.988 --> 35:31.988
(Vermin sounds)

35:57.752 --> 35:58.948
Oh, no!

36:01.690 --> 36:03.868
Sarah must have closed it.

36:18.611 --> 36:19.400
(Abby) Becker!

37:05.167 --> 37:07.067
Go! Go!

37:25.483 --> 37:26.857
(Danny)
Lock it now!

37:34.205 --> 37:35.828
(Sarah)
Are you all right?

37:38.908 --> 37:40.868
Does that hurt?

37:42.550 --> 37:45.113
Abby, what just happened?

37:45.249 --> 37:47.301
If I told you
Becker would have to kill you.

37:47.421 --> 37:49.288
He's already looking
for an excuse.

37:49.424 --> 37:51.769
Maybe one day,
just not now.

37:52.584 --> 37:54.144
(Jack) That's the last time
I do work experience with you.

37:54.264 --> 37:56.522
(Abby) Don't ever frighten me
like that again, Jack.

37:56.882 --> 37:58.668
I think it's time
I moved out.

37:59.469 --> 38:01.589
- Are you sure?
- Living with you is dangerous.

38:04.272 --> 38:05.240
Good decision.

38:05.476 --> 38:08.820
There's something
I need to tell you about Connor.

38:12.537 --> 38:13.948
Private.

38:30.739 --> 38:32.503
Why are you staring at me?

38:32.623 --> 38:34.628
Jack told me
what you did.

38:36.077 --> 38:38.883
Whatever it is there's
a reasonable explanation for it.

38:39.257 --> 38:41.958
He told me about gambling Rex
and you getting him back.

38:46.051 --> 38:49.068
You could have made Jack
look really bad, but you didn't.

38:50.682 --> 38:51.682
Why not?

38:54.586 --> 38:56.747
I knew
how much you loved him.

38:57.392 --> 38:59.547
I didn't want you
to be hurt.

38:59.679 --> 39:00.440
Sorry.

39:00.782 --> 39:02.827
Even after
I said those horrible...

39:03.120 --> 39:05.564
...and unfair things
about you hating him,

39:06.556 --> 39:07.982
you still kept quiet.

39:11.249 --> 39:13.145
You did all that for me.

39:17.173 --> 39:18.908
Abby, I -

39:20.347 --> 39:21.789
I want...

39:23.368 --> 39:25.038
I mean...

39:28.439 --> 39:30.548
I feel that we...

39:31.749 --> 39:33.073
- I want to say-
- Connor.

39:35.104 --> 39:36.326
Shut up.

40:03.533 --> 40:04.802
Yes, sir.
I'll tell him.

40:04.803 --> 40:06.707
Alright, you guys,
let's get out of here.

40:26.984 --> 40:29.034
It's definitely Captain Wilder.

40:30.344 --> 40:32.466
(Lester)
You didn't recognise the girl?

40:32.754 --> 40:33.756
(Danny) No.

40:35.741 --> 40:38.253
- No other signs of humanity?
- No.

40:41.622 --> 40:45.148
I think we can be fairly confident
Christine Johnson's involved.

40:45.278 --> 40:47.128
Fairly. And?

40:48.995 --> 40:52.305
There was an anomaly alert a
few months ago at her headquarters.

40:52.457 --> 40:54.148
She said it was nothing.
False alarm.

40:54.708 --> 40:56.881
You think she has access
to an anomaly?

40:57.008 --> 41:00.533
And a cloaking device,
which is why we don't pick it up.

41:02.068 --> 41:04.796
- What is she up to?
- I don't know. But I'll find out.

41:06.748 --> 41:09.548
No, no. I need to handle this
through official channels.

41:12.196 --> 41:15.147
- I mean it, Danny. No freelancing.
- Allright...

41:15.590 --> 41:17.644
Look, I've got to...

41:17.838 --> 41:21.689
- You've got something on your...
- Yeah, thanks.

41:34.762 --> 41:36.458
(Christine) Is she injured?

41:37.536 --> 41:40.193
Nothing physical.
But she was in shock.

41:40.617 --> 41:42.854
We gave her
something to make her sleep.

41:43.007 --> 41:44.520
She had this.

42:03.365 --> 42:05.956
I'll keep this.
Put that back.

42:06.092 --> 42:08.689
We don't want to upset her
unless we have to.

42:10.132 --> 42:12.466
I want to know
the minute she wakes up.

42:28.534 --> 42:31.403
(Lester) Johnson's military.
We can't go in on a hunch...

42:31.606 --> 42:33.505
(Lester) ...that she has
some mysterious woman...

42:33.506 --> 42:34.455
...from the future.

42:34.676 --> 42:37.493
- You tried to run. Why?
- I'll show you.

42:48.340 --> 42:50.437
- Oh, my God!
- I'm guessing that's the bull.

42:53.638 --> 42:54.638
Oh, no...

42:56.988 --> 43:00.187
(Sarah) Keep the bull away,
the anomaly's closed.

43:00.328 --> 43:01.328
Abby!

43:05.329 --> 43:06.273
What is that thing?

43:06.274 --> 43:09.108
I'll explain later.
Just take me there now.
