00:00.041 --> 00:01.763
Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:01.788 --> 00:03.599
It was another natural disaster.

00:03.703 --> 00:05.288
My mom's BFF, Ally.

00:05.389 --> 00:06.631
What's up, lil' bitch?

00:06.743 --> 00:07.741
Oh, you guys haven't met.

00:07.866 --> 00:09.600
Courtney, this is Jenna.

00:09.722 --> 00:11.054
Ricky?

00:11.895 --> 00:13.818
- I love you.
- Awesome.

00:23.956 --> 00:26.289
I couldn't shake what was
keeping me awake.

00:26.291 --> 00:27.857
That Jake said he loved me.

00:27.859 --> 00:31.428
I didn't say it back,
and I didn't know why.

00:31.430 --> 00:34.697
What I did know was
why I loved ice cream.

00:34.699 --> 00:37.900
It was a delicious,
comforting and cruel reminder

00:37.902 --> 00:40.703
of how cold I must have seemed
when I left Jake hanging.

00:40.705 --> 00:43.506
But I never left
my hoodies hanging

00:43.508 --> 00:45.308
because it was
obvious I loved them.

00:45.310 --> 00:47.177
They were versatile,
good for all seasons

00:47.179 --> 00:50.013
and could hide me from the
probing, late night questions

00:50.015 --> 00:51.381
I didn't wanna face.

00:51.383 --> 00:53.016
So I didn't know how I felt.

00:53.018 --> 00:54.284
I knew how to read a label.

00:54.286 --> 00:55.852
The label would tell me how long

00:55.854 --> 00:57.753
it would take
for my problem to go away.

00:57.755 --> 01:00.423
Six weeks. The same amount of
time it took Jake

01:00.425 --> 01:02.258
to know that he loved me.

01:02.260 --> 01:04.227
Maybe I did know.

01:04.229 --> 01:06.229
But I didn't realize it yet.

01:06.231 --> 01:08.098
Because it was too soon.

01:08.100 --> 01:09.632
And that was okay.

01:09.634 --> 01:11.301
Nobody falls in love overnight.

01:11.303 --> 01:12.435
It happened overnight.

01:12.437 --> 01:13.903
I'm in love.

01:13.905 --> 01:16.272
Or maybe they do.

01:19.921 --> 01:25.781
I can't believe my best friend
is in love and engaged!

01:25.783 --> 01:27.950
And what do you mean by "it
happened overnight"?

01:27.952 --> 01:30.920
Considering that ally's longest
relationship was with nicotine,

01:30.922 --> 01:33.923
her spontaneous engagement
seemed a bit sketch.

01:33.925 --> 01:35.558
Details. We want them all.

01:35.560 --> 01:37.527
Dan. That's his name.

01:37.529 --> 01:39.229
You were always
so good with Dans.

01:39.231 --> 01:41.531
- Mm-hmm.
- What does he do?

01:41.533 --> 01:43.699
Ugh, something business-y.

01:43.701 --> 01:47.070
I'm not clear on exactly what,
but the man is flush.

01:47.072 --> 01:49.772
And the man drives a Porsche

01:49.774 --> 01:52.875
with a personalized license
plate that says--

01:52.877 --> 01:53.943
- "Dan the man"?

01:53.945 --> 01:55.778
Yes! Good guess.

01:55.780 --> 01:56.779
It was educated.

01:56.781 --> 01:58.381
If the dude wanted
to marry Ally,

01:58.383 --> 02:00.116
he had to have
questionable taste.

02:00.118 --> 02:01.151
Don't judge, lil' bitch.

02:01.153 --> 02:02.318
Be grateful that your future

02:02.320 --> 02:03.486
uncle in law can afford

02:03.488 --> 02:04.687
to surgically pack your cans

02:04.689 --> 02:05.955
since nature's not going to.

02:05.957 --> 02:07.424
Love him already.

02:07.426 --> 02:09.725
So, two weeks ago, while I was
visiting my folks,

02:09.727 --> 02:11.194
I was working down
at the beach club

02:11.196 --> 02:12.995
while I pretended
to look for a job.

02:12.997 --> 02:14.764
Meanwhile, Dan was pretending
to work out

02:14.766 --> 02:17.733
while he made it his job to
watch me sweat.

02:17.735 --> 02:19.802
[Both chuckle]

02:19.804 --> 02:21.804
And then you got to know him
and he said he loved you

02:21.806 --> 02:23.606
and while you weren't sure how
you felt at first,

02:23.608 --> 02:25.375
you soon realized that he was
the best guy you ever met?

02:25.377 --> 02:27.677
No. Then we went to Paris

02:27.679 --> 02:31.847
and he put a 4.6 karat
rock on my finger. Bam!

02:31.849 --> 02:33.383
He took you to Paris?

02:33.385 --> 02:35.718
And he gave me his black Amex.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.687
So when did
you know you loved him?

02:37.689 --> 02:39.789
I don't know.
In the airport?

02:39.791 --> 02:42.225
I can't remember
all the details.

02:42.227 --> 02:44.527
Can't you just be happy for me?

02:44.529 --> 02:45.962
Jenna, we saw that.

02:45.964 --> 02:47.363
It was a supportive eye roll,

02:47.365 --> 02:49.099
because now you don't have to
get a job.

02:49.101 --> 02:50.333
I know!

02:50.335 --> 02:51.367
I don't know,

02:51.369 --> 02:52.435
I just didn't say it back.

02:52.437 --> 02:54.070
So you left Jake hanging?

02:54.072 --> 02:55.505
No, I kissed him.

02:55.507 --> 02:57.640
Okay, this is promising.
And then?

02:57.642 --> 02:59.109
And then I might have said,
"awesome."

02:59.111 --> 03:00.743
Holy pulled goalie.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.945
Exactly, it was pre-emotional
ejaculation.

03:02.947 --> 03:05.582
No, saying "awesome"
on the heels of an ily

03:05.584 --> 03:08.218
is the equivalent of knocking
someone up with heartache.

03:08.220 --> 03:09.619
Or peeing in their face.

03:09.621 --> 03:11.154
Which you wouldn't know,
tinkle-bell.

03:11.156 --> 03:12.222
That's right.

03:12.224 --> 03:13.356
I have an explosive bladder.

03:13.358 --> 03:14.524
It has a mind of its own

03:14.526 --> 03:16.826
so step away or
I might spray you.

03:16.828 --> 03:18.561
Okay, think fast.

03:18.563 --> 03:21.063
Imagine I'm an unhinged,
over-medicated hair stylist

03:21.065 --> 03:22.932
and I'm about to mow down your
mane that you've been growing

03:22.934 --> 03:24.267
since the fourth grade unless
you answer

03:24.269 --> 03:25.968
this question honestly.

03:25.970 --> 03:27.003
Are you in love with Jake?

03:27.005 --> 03:28.471
One. Two.

03:28.473 --> 03:29.939
It's not that I don't feel
something.

03:29.941 --> 03:31.141
It's just that I'm not sure
I feel "it".

03:31.143 --> 03:32.942
You're not in love.

03:33.344 --> 03:35.611
Don't be so tentative.

03:35.613 --> 03:36.812
Grab 'em!

03:36.814 --> 03:38.280
I like it when you take charge.

03:38.282 --> 03:40.049
And I like it
when you don't speak.

03:40.051 --> 03:41.717
Oh, you're such a woman.

03:41.719 --> 03:45.187
Pipe down and feel me up.

03:45.189 --> 03:46.556
I can't stop
thinking about you.

03:46.558 --> 03:47.857
And you can't tell me you don't

03:47.859 --> 03:49.358
feel what's happening
between us.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.660
Oh, I can.

03:50.662 --> 03:51.761
And if you'd shut up,

03:51.763 --> 03:54.463
I might let it out to breathe.

03:54.465 --> 03:56.732
This isn't just some sordid
affair, dollface.

03:56.734 --> 03:59.035
I wanna win your heart.

03:59.037 --> 04:03.539
I am not, nor will I ever be
your dollface.

04:03.541 --> 04:05.274
- Why not?
- It should be obvi,

04:05.276 --> 04:07.743
but I guess I need
to break it down.

04:07.745 --> 04:09.511
I don't do band geeks.

04:09.513 --> 04:11.013
At least not in public.

04:11.015 --> 04:15.317
Ah, but I'm the schwartzman.

04:15.319 --> 04:16.418
I am the band.

04:16.420 --> 04:20.355
Then this is all you get.

04:25.462 --> 04:27.797
Okay, so let's
say I'm not in love,

04:27.799 --> 04:29.198
which I'm not saying.

04:29.200 --> 04:30.700
- What do I do?
- Break up.

04:30.702 --> 04:32.702
- Break up? Why?
- Because it's not fair.

04:32.704 --> 04:33.803
You're leading him on.

04:33.805 --> 04:35.471
I'm not leading him on.

04:35.473 --> 04:36.806
I'm taking my time.

04:36.808 --> 04:37.940
Matty did that with me

04:37.942 --> 04:39.241
and he came around eventually.

04:39.243 --> 04:41.276
When you were in
a new relationship.

04:41.278 --> 04:42.945
But I love being
Jake's girlfriend.

04:42.947 --> 04:44.780
See, love just
slipped right out.

04:44.782 --> 04:46.281
Totally unprovoked.

04:46.283 --> 04:47.316
That's a good sign.

04:47.318 --> 04:48.751
Maybe I'm coming around.

04:48.753 --> 04:51.220
You don't just come around.
You know.

04:51.222 --> 04:53.355
Like with Fred,
I could tell the second

04:53.357 --> 04:56.125
he pumped me a cup with more
foam than beer.

04:56.127 --> 04:57.927
He could sense I was
a lightweight.

04:57.929 --> 04:59.962
I think everyone
could sense that

04:59.964 --> 05:01.396
when you were
blowing chunks by the door.

05:01.398 --> 05:03.633
But, that doesn't
take anything away

05:03.635 --> 05:05.034
from the fact
that you know, Ming.

05:05.036 --> 05:07.036
'Cause people just know
when they know.

05:07.038 --> 05:09.905
But how do you know
when you know?

05:09.907 --> 05:14.209
- Hey, beautiful.
- Die.

05:14.211 --> 05:15.277
Damn it.

05:15.279 --> 05:16.612
You just know.

05:16.614 --> 05:17.847
And you know I'm the one

05:17.849 --> 05:19.348
and only Jake Rosati,

05:19.350 --> 05:20.549
with a special guest.

05:20.551 --> 05:22.584
Matty McKibben.

05:22.586 --> 05:25.154
And these are the Palace Hills
morning announcements.

05:25.156 --> 05:26.889
It's black history month,
titans,

05:26.891 --> 05:29.158
and so today we have a very
special history lesson

05:29.160 --> 05:31.527
brought to you via recording
from our very own,

05:31.529 --> 05:35.464
very white history teacher,
Mr. Samuel Wollman.

05:35.466 --> 05:39.501
So last night... ending up
at the same place.

05:39.503 --> 05:41.336
- That was a little awkward.
- Yeah.

05:41.338 --> 05:42.604
But not as awkward as it was

05:42.606 --> 05:43.839
when I told Jenna
that I loved her.

05:43.841 --> 05:45.775
What? When did
you guys have sex?

05:45.777 --> 05:47.309
We haven't.

05:47.311 --> 05:49.645
But that's off the table
because I freaked her out.

05:49.647 --> 05:51.180
You know what
her response to me was?

05:51.182 --> 05:52.948
"Awesome."

05:52.950 --> 05:54.150
Yeah,
that's because you can't say

05:54.152 --> 05:55.651
"I love you"
before you have sex.

05:55.653 --> 05:56.852
Come on, man,
there isn't an order.

05:56.854 --> 05:59.155
Dude you are so JV.
[Laughs]

05:59.157 --> 06:02.591
Right now you are at the
"I love hanging out with you"

06:02.593 --> 06:04.927
or the "I love
being around you" phase.

06:04.929 --> 06:06.128
You aren't supposed to blow

06:06.130 --> 06:07.797
the "I love you" wad
until after sex.

06:07.799 --> 06:09.565
That's the carrot you dangle
to get it, baby.

06:09.567 --> 06:11.600
- I could just take it back.
- You can't take it back.

06:11.602 --> 06:12.902
It's out there.

06:12.904 --> 06:14.570
Now you just gotta play it cool,
all right.

06:14.572 --> 06:18.207
Easy for you to say, you've
never been in love before.

06:18.209 --> 06:19.241
Aha.

06:19.243 --> 06:20.609
Evidence of my love.

06:20.611 --> 06:23.112
Note the big smile,
warm embrace.

06:23.114 --> 06:27.817
Need I say more?

06:27.819 --> 06:29.618
Hey, do we look in love?

06:29.620 --> 06:30.820
Thank you.

06:30.822 --> 06:31.821
If I didn't know these people,

06:31.823 --> 06:32.755
I'd be convinced.

06:32.757 --> 06:34.289
But you do know these people.

06:34.291 --> 06:36.859
And you don't need to convince
me or anyone else.

06:36.861 --> 06:39.428
You need to convince yourself
and maybe your notebook.

06:39.430 --> 06:40.763
Of what?

06:40.765 --> 06:43.165
That you're not
still into Matty.

06:43.167 --> 06:45.634
No way.
That ship has sailed.

06:45.636 --> 06:47.169
It wasn't entirely true.

06:47.171 --> 06:50.039
My feelings for Matty were
present and accounted for.

06:50.041 --> 06:53.275
But like Jake, I didn't know
how to interpret them.

06:53.277 --> 06:56.278
Was residual love for Matty
clouding my new love for Jake?

06:56.280 --> 07:00.116
We know you were in love with
Matty, but when did you know?

07:00.118 --> 07:05.054
- It was... after we had sex.
- Okay.

07:05.056 --> 07:06.922
You have to have sex with Jake,
then you'll know.

07:06.924 --> 07:09.291
I wasn't sure I was ready
to have sex with Jake.

07:09.293 --> 07:11.727
It wasn't a question I ever
pondered with Matty.

07:11.729 --> 07:12.895
I just did it.

07:12.897 --> 07:15.364
Did I just need
to do "it" again?

07:15.366 --> 07:17.299
[Bell rings]

07:25.742 --> 07:27.376
[Chuckles]

07:27.378 --> 07:29.511
Hey.

07:29.513 --> 07:30.913
Yo.

07:30.915 --> 07:32.714
- I've been thinking--
- That's funny.

07:32.716 --> 07:34.817
Because, uh,
last night, I wasn't.

07:34.819 --> 07:37.486
I think I know what
you're about to say.

07:37.488 --> 07:38.921
- We should have sex.
- What?

07:38.923 --> 07:41.323
[Over intercom]
I think we should have sex.

07:41.325 --> 07:44.160
[All laugh]

07:44.162 --> 07:45.360
Oh, uh, the mic.

07:45.362 --> 07:47.196
- Was that just--
- Yeah.

07:51.510 --> 07:53.711
So I've megaphoned
my mission to bang my beau.

07:53.713 --> 07:56.080
Maybe no one knew the voice
over the PA was me.

07:56.082 --> 07:59.384
Dude, yo I heard
Jenna Hamilton rolls commando

07:59.386 --> 08:01.619
so she's good to go
at all times.

08:01.621 --> 08:04.088
Apparently,
Jenna Hamilton can't live

08:04.090 --> 08:05.990
without Jake's man juice.

08:05.992 --> 08:09.126
Jenna Hamilton can't
keep it in her pants.

08:09.128 --> 08:11.862
Slut.

08:11.864 --> 08:13.898
I was overreacting.

08:13.900 --> 08:16.000
There was nothing to avoid.

08:16.002 --> 08:17.968
Nothing but--
[Both laugh]

08:17.970 --> 08:19.003
My pile of denial.

08:19.005 --> 08:21.906
Which I had stepped in. Again.

08:21.908 --> 08:23.775
I'm down to bone.

08:23.777 --> 08:27.578
Nice try, dude, but the girl's
got higher standards.

08:27.580 --> 08:30.214
Which I would know firsthand.

08:30.216 --> 08:33.017
- Come on, it was a joke.
- Not funny.

08:33.019 --> 08:34.885
Okay, I'll quit.

08:34.886 --> 08:37.288
- So...
- So...

08:37.289 --> 08:38.856
You and Jake
are gonna do the deed.

08:38.857 --> 08:42.592
I realize I made
a very public pronouncement,

08:42.595 --> 08:44.329
but I'm not ready to discuss
the details with you.

08:44.331 --> 08:45.330
Why not?

08:45.332 --> 08:46.698
Um, because you and I

08:46.700 --> 08:48.199
were just sealing the deal
a few months ago

08:48.201 --> 08:49.367
and because it's weird.

08:49.369 --> 08:50.668
Maybe talking about it

08:50.670 --> 08:52.102
will help us get out of
the weird zone

08:52.104 --> 08:53.904
and put us into the friend one.

08:53.906 --> 08:55.673
You should let me casually
give Jake some pointers

08:55.675 --> 08:58.108
about the Jenna dos and don'ts.

08:58.110 --> 09:00.845
Wait, what do you mean,
Jenna's dos and don'ts?

09:00.847 --> 09:02.613
You know, the stuff you do
and don't like when doing it.

09:02.615 --> 09:05.182
I do not have dos and don'ts.

09:05.184 --> 09:06.851
Oh, yes you do.
Remember the playhouse?

09:06.853 --> 09:08.085
You were on top of me,
and you--

09:08.087 --> 09:10.421
Do not tell Jake to do that.

09:10.423 --> 09:12.022
I'm not gonna
tell Jake anything.

09:12.024 --> 09:16.260
But I will tell you this.
Go easy, he's nervous.

09:16.262 --> 09:19.029
He really... likes you.

09:19.031 --> 09:21.599
While the Jake case was still
under investigation,

09:21.601 --> 09:24.802
I realized the Matty case had
not gone cold.

09:24.804 --> 09:27.438
It was closed 'cause I finally
knew something.

09:27.440 --> 09:28.740
Matty and I were friends.

09:28.742 --> 09:32.643
What's up, suicidal slut?

09:32.645 --> 09:35.747
Get used to it, sex is gonna pay
your way through college.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.047
You're welcome.

09:37.049 --> 09:40.351
Mmm, dollface.

09:40.353 --> 09:42.186
Skedatz, I have a call to make.

09:42.188 --> 09:45.790
Don't look at me, keep moving,
pull out your phone

09:45.792 --> 09:48.125
and pretend you're
having a conversation.

09:48.127 --> 09:52.730
What happened between us was
supposed to be a one time deal.

09:52.732 --> 09:54.832
One and done.

09:54.834 --> 09:58.168
It was Valentine's Day, and I
was in a vulnerable place.

09:58.170 --> 10:01.038
This morning was... hormonal.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.840
Don't read into it!

10:02.842 --> 10:05.810
I'm gonna fall apart
without you, dollface.

10:05.812 --> 10:07.211
You can live with that?

10:07.213 --> 10:08.780
I'm gonna cry.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.681
I'm seriously gonna cry right
here right now.

10:10.683 --> 10:12.950
Fine, meet me after school.

10:12.952 --> 10:15.853
But consider it a parting gift.

10:19.525 --> 10:22.960
I know what
you're doing after school.

10:22.962 --> 10:24.028
Everyone does.

10:24.030 --> 10:25.362
If it isn't "info nympho"

10:25.364 --> 10:26.531
and "peed-her-pants pants."

10:26.533 --> 10:30.200
I prefer tinkle-bell,
thank you!

10:30.202 --> 10:31.402
It's fun to be us.

10:31.404 --> 10:32.904
[Over intercom] Jenna Hamilton,

10:32.906 --> 10:35.840
please report to
the vice principal's office.

10:35.842 --> 10:40.144
So, I heard there might be
something you wanna discuss.

10:40.146 --> 10:41.278
Nope. Nothing.

10:41.280 --> 10:42.747
Not even...

10:42.749 --> 10:45.616
Chugga-chugga-chugga
-choo-choo?

10:45.618 --> 10:47.384
- Definitely not that.
- All right, listen.

10:47.386 --> 10:48.653
I'm gonna give
you a little advice

10:48.655 --> 10:50.321
that my mom imparted on me.

10:50.323 --> 10:51.989
Always be a lady in the street,

10:51.991 --> 10:55.159
freak in the sheets,
and quiet over the PA system.

10:55.161 --> 10:56.461
Your mom said that?

10:56.463 --> 10:58.128
Actually,
it might have been Usher.

10:58.130 --> 11:00.698
And the PA tidbit, that's
just my own rule of thumb.

11:00.700 --> 11:02.366
I find that sometimes
it's better to use

11:02.368 --> 11:06.537
suggestive gestures in public
rather than overt expressions

11:06.539 --> 11:09.640
- like, "do me, big boy."
- I didn't say that.

11:09.642 --> 11:11.175
No what you said
just spelled it out.

11:11.177 --> 11:12.409
At least "do me, big boy"

11:12.411 --> 11:13.711
has alternate connotations,

11:13.713 --> 11:15.713
like spreading mustard
on a footlong.

11:15.715 --> 11:19.851
Jenna, I am not trying to
further your embarrassment

11:19.853 --> 11:22.854
or turn this into a bigger deal
than it already is,

11:22.856 --> 11:26.056
- but you could go to jail!
- For what?

11:26.058 --> 11:27.792
P.M.U.I.

11:27.794 --> 11:29.560
Premeditated
underage intercourse.

11:29.562 --> 11:32.396
There's no law against
wanting to have sex.

11:32.398 --> 11:33.931
There is if you wanna
have sex with a minor.

11:33.933 --> 11:35.132
We're both minors.

11:35.134 --> 11:36.166
I'm not a pervert.

11:36.168 --> 11:37.234
Well...

11:37.236 --> 11:38.268
That's still up for debate.

11:38.270 --> 11:39.436
I mean, we already know

11:39.438 --> 11:40.671
you have a fetish
for open forums.

11:40.673 --> 11:43.508
- Can I go now?
- Sure, see you at home.

11:43.510 --> 11:45.309
- What?
- Oh, I'm going to yoga

11:45.311 --> 11:46.777
this afternoon with L-Dawg.

11:46.779 --> 11:48.713
Your mom.

11:48.715 --> 11:52.850
Don't worry, I won't let her
know you're a ho-bag.

11:54.887 --> 11:57.421
Between all the heckles and
howls, I had come to my senses.

11:57.423 --> 11:59.490
Sex was not the answer.

11:59.492 --> 12:01.993
- The answer is yes.
- To what?

12:01.995 --> 12:04.428
To the question that reverbed
around the hall?

12:04.430 --> 12:06.230
That was more of a statement.

12:06.232 --> 12:08.699
Either way, I'm in.

12:08.701 --> 12:10.801
Okay, so I guess we should
talk logistics.

12:10.803 --> 12:12.670
- When do you wanna do it?
- As soon as possible.

12:12.672 --> 12:16.240
Okay, how's
tomorrow after school?

12:16.242 --> 12:18.943
Uh, I have AsB. Friday?

12:18.945 --> 12:20.244
Out with my dad. Darn it.

12:20.246 --> 12:21.245
Guess we're gonna have to wait.

12:21.247 --> 12:22.379
And maybe forget.

12:22.381 --> 12:25.182
Okay, well let's just look

12:25.184 --> 12:27.117
at next week and pencil it in.

12:27.119 --> 12:29.854
You know, so we don't forget.

12:29.856 --> 12:33.323
It looks like I could
squeeze it in now. You?

12:33.325 --> 12:35.125
You're in luck.

12:35.127 --> 12:36.761
And I was in trouble.

12:36.763 --> 12:38.328
There were no
take-backs with sex.

12:38.330 --> 12:39.830
Good to go. Where to?

12:39.832 --> 12:42.066
- My car?
- It's too small.

12:42.068 --> 12:43.601
Oh, yeah.

12:43.603 --> 12:45.002
Well doesn't your mom
have yoga today?

12:45.004 --> 12:46.871
Yeah, but she's only gonna be
gone two hours.

12:46.873 --> 12:47.939
Two hours.

12:47.941 --> 12:50.041
I'll be lucky if
I last two minutes.

12:50.043 --> 12:50.975
- [Chuckles]
- I mean...

12:50.977 --> 12:52.910
Uh, 20.. minutes.

12:52.912 --> 12:55.913
Are you sure you wanna do this?
We don't have to.

12:55.915 --> 12:57.347
You know,
if you're nervous, or...

12:57.349 --> 12:59.216
And like that, I wasn't.

12:59.218 --> 13:00.651
Jake wasn't laying
on the pressure.

13:00.653 --> 13:02.252
He was buckling under it.

13:02.254 --> 13:03.454
- I wanna do it.
- Yes!

13:03.456 --> 13:06.090
I mean, it's cool, baby.

13:06.092 --> 13:08.926
I can't believe you wanted to
do it in your car.

13:08.928 --> 13:11.095
[Kissing noises]

13:11.097 --> 13:13.030
- I quit band.
- Good for you.

13:13.032 --> 13:17.702
Babe, I traded in my tenor sax
for my tender saxton.

13:17.704 --> 13:21.205
- That was idiotic.
- I'm a fool.

13:21.207 --> 13:22.473
Fool for love.

13:22.475 --> 13:24.174
What the hell
is wrong with you?

13:24.176 --> 13:27.812
I treat you like crap and you
keep coming back for more.

13:27.814 --> 13:28.879
I get it.

13:28.881 --> 13:29.847
You're too good for me.

13:29.849 --> 13:31.281
I knew I could never be

13:31.283 --> 13:35.786
with a girl as funny and as
smart and as beautiful as you,

13:35.788 --> 13:38.422
but I had to try.

13:38.424 --> 13:40.891
Why can't this
just be about sex?

13:40.893 --> 13:43.728
- Well, we aren't having sex.
- You know what I mean.

13:43.730 --> 13:45.663
Don't play with me, dollface.

13:45.665 --> 13:47.632
If I don't have you
and I don't have the band,

13:47.634 --> 13:48.966
I got nothing in this world.

13:48.968 --> 13:52.937
Aw, Jesus, kiss me
before I throw up.

13:52.939 --> 13:54.672
Are you excited?

13:54.674 --> 13:57.008
- I can tell you are.
- We're doing this.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.944
We're really doing this.

14:02.781 --> 14:05.149
Oh...

14:05.151 --> 14:07.284
We're not doing this.

14:09.120 --> 14:10.854
Mom? Isn't it time for yoga?

14:10.998 --> 14:13.165
Ally here persuaded us
to down the hatch

14:13.167 --> 14:15.234
instead of downward the dog.

14:15.236 --> 14:19.939
Wait a minute, did we spoil
your plan to have sex?

14:19.941 --> 14:21.140
- [Gasps]
- [Giggles]

14:21.142 --> 14:24.076
And on that note,
nice to see you.

14:24.078 --> 14:25.444
- Rain check?
- Rain check.

14:25.446 --> 14:28.380
[All giggle]

14:31.919 --> 14:34.987
[Doorbell rings]

14:36.790 --> 14:39.291
What are you doing here?

14:39.293 --> 14:41.493
Oh, it's my favorite niece.

14:41.495 --> 14:43.963
I'm your only niece.

14:43.965 --> 14:45.898
Dan the man is your uncle?

14:45.900 --> 14:47.066
Jenna's also her niece.

14:47.068 --> 14:48.067
Please tell me we are

14:48.069 --> 14:49.602
not about to be related.

14:49.604 --> 14:51.604
- She's all yours.
- So you guys know each other?

14:51.606 --> 14:52.838
Everyone knows Jenna.

14:52.840 --> 14:54.406
She has a reputation.

14:54.408 --> 14:55.808
Are you ready to go?

14:55.810 --> 14:59.445
Jenna, isn't it fun
that Dan is Sadie's uncle

14:59.447 --> 15:02.414
and he went
to Palace Hills, too.

15:02.416 --> 15:06.786
Although he must have been
a few years ahead of us.

15:06.788 --> 15:07.887
How about a decade?

15:07.889 --> 15:09.889
My uncle like 'em young.

15:09.891 --> 15:11.857
Well, young-ish.

15:11.859 --> 15:12.959
Thanks, sweets.

15:12.961 --> 15:14.994
He's not quite the ten I am.

15:14.996 --> 15:17.129
Let's be honest, he's a four.

15:17.131 --> 15:18.731
And since we're
about to be family,

15:18.733 --> 15:20.132
I won't pull any punches.

15:20.134 --> 15:23.235
You're more of a six.
You're welcome.

15:23.237 --> 15:25.571
You're pretty funny
for a big girl.

15:25.573 --> 15:28.641
And you're refreshingly
transparent for a gold-digger.

15:28.643 --> 15:31.477
Al, I'm worried.
I really think you need

15:31.479 --> 15:34.480
to sleep with Dan
before you get married.

15:34.482 --> 15:36.816
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you haven't
sampled the goods?

15:36.818 --> 15:41.721
Oh, I've sampled and let me
tell you, he is well-endowed.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.623
- In the bank.
- Woo woo!

15:43.625 --> 15:46.592
- Why are you deflecting.
- She's got herpes.

15:46.594 --> 15:49.629
I'm not gonna lie, I've had to
get past a few things.

15:49.631 --> 15:50.896
Like his back.

15:50.898 --> 15:52.464
I mean, the man might
be part-bear.

15:52.466 --> 15:53.766
But he thinks I'm smart

15:53.768 --> 15:55.434
and funny and beautiful.

15:55.436 --> 15:56.802
[Loud whisper]
He's trying to get laid.

15:56.804 --> 15:58.771
He sees me the way I see
myself.

15:58.773 --> 16:00.572
Perfect as is.

16:00.574 --> 16:03.575
That's why I want our first
time to be special.

16:03.577 --> 16:05.911
But it isn't your first time,
so how can it be special?

16:05.913 --> 16:07.379
Oh, it can be special.

16:07.381 --> 16:09.481
- Your dad was special.
- That doesn't count.

16:09.483 --> 16:10.516
He was your one and only.

16:10.518 --> 16:11.550
[Stifles laugh]

16:11.552 --> 16:13.786
- Shh!
- [Laughs]

16:13.788 --> 16:16.288
Your mom had a life
before your dad.

16:16.290 --> 16:17.857
But not quite the life
I've had.

16:17.859 --> 16:21.593
That is code for huge
va-jay-jay.

16:21.595 --> 16:22.862
I used to jump into the sack

16:22.864 --> 16:24.930
thinking it would
clarify how I felt.

16:24.932 --> 16:26.231
- And did it?
- No.

16:26.233 --> 16:27.700
If the feelings
weren't there before,

16:27.702 --> 16:30.235
then the sex was just that. Sex.

16:30.237 --> 16:33.372
By the way, Lace,
you could use some.

16:33.374 --> 16:36.175
We're gonna start mining
your new husband prospects

16:36.177 --> 16:38.878
at my wedding.
[Laughs]

16:38.880 --> 16:42.481
Are you implying
that my current husband

16:42.483 --> 16:43.816
isn't gonna work out?

16:43.818 --> 16:46.285
Because... I'm a terrible person

16:46.287 --> 16:48.888
and he deserves better.
[Sobs]

16:48.890 --> 16:52.658
I don't think
he loves me anymore.

16:52.660 --> 16:55.861
You know, if you drink enough
wine, it tastes like love.

16:55.863 --> 17:00.566
I'm gonna go to my room.

17:00.568 --> 17:02.267
- Skinny bitch.
- Yeah? - Yeah? - Yeah?

17:02.269 --> 17:03.969
I'm leaving in three minutes
so you better deal

17:03.971 --> 17:06.471
with this emotional
crisis quickly.

17:06.473 --> 17:08.207
I'll be in the car.

17:08.209 --> 17:10.910
- I hate her.
- I love her.

17:10.912 --> 17:15.848
[Phone rings]

17:15.849 --> 17:17.083
Dollface?

17:17.085 --> 17:18.117
Did you mean all those things

17:18.118 --> 17:19.251
you said to me today?

17:19.252 --> 17:20.886
- Which ones?
- All of them.

17:20.887 --> 17:22.788
Yes, of course.

17:22.790 --> 17:23.888
Do you hate me?

17:23.891 --> 17:24.924
No.

17:24.925 --> 17:27.193
- Do you like me?
- Maybe.

17:27.194 --> 17:28.426
Can I take you to dinner?

17:28.429 --> 17:31.530
Don't push it,
but call me later.

17:31.532 --> 17:32.798
Yes!

17:34.534 --> 17:36.702
On my quest
to figure out my feelings,

17:36.704 --> 17:38.838
I was left only more confused.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.906
If sex wouldn't
clarify anything,

17:40.908 --> 17:42.474
was it worth the risk?

17:42.476 --> 17:46.278
Honey?

17:46.280 --> 17:50.216
I am sorry we got carried away
with all of that girl talk.

17:50.218 --> 17:51.984
I did not mean
to embarrass you.

17:51.986 --> 17:53.585
Don't worry,
it wasn't the first time.

17:53.587 --> 17:55.855
And it won't be the last.

17:55.857 --> 17:58.523
Mom, were you in love with
the other guys you slept with?

17:58.525 --> 18:01.093
Guy. There was only one.

18:01.095 --> 18:03.929
And I don't know if I was in
love with him.

18:03.931 --> 18:07.032
We had sex before
I knew how I felt.

18:07.034 --> 18:10.335
But with your dad, it just...

18:10.337 --> 18:13.806
It all happened
at the same time.

18:13.808 --> 18:16.208
Jenna, contrary to the advice

18:16.210 --> 18:18.911
I've been giving Ally,
you need to know

18:18.913 --> 18:23.582
that every first time
is the first time.

18:23.584 --> 18:26.518
And it should be special.

18:32.592 --> 18:33.759
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, babe.

18:33.761 --> 18:35.094
Pick me up in ten.

18:35.096 --> 18:37.229
I'll bring the condoms.

18:39.997 --> 18:41.211
Well, here we are.

18:41.384 --> 18:44.186
Yep, here we are
in your mom's minivan

18:44.188 --> 18:45.420
in a discrete location.

18:45.422 --> 18:47.723
Call me crazy, but this feels
a little hinky.

18:47.725 --> 18:49.792
Damn it, now you've ruined

18:49.794 --> 18:51.727
my surprised hijacking
of your virginity.

18:51.729 --> 18:53.595
Oh, right,
that's already been taken.

18:53.597 --> 18:55.430
Touche. Okay, let's do this.

18:55.432 --> 18:58.700
Hold on, hold on, you're
getting ahead of yourself.

18:58.702 --> 19:01.837
[Van beeps]

19:07.110 --> 19:09.678
- Moonlight romance.
- Ooh, swanky.

19:09.680 --> 19:10.712
Necessary.

19:10.714 --> 19:12.848
My sister's a big slob.

19:12.850 --> 19:15.684
- Just trying to make it--
- Special?

19:15.686 --> 19:17.352
Come here.

19:17.354 --> 19:18.988
Uh, wait, wait.

19:18.990 --> 19:21.190
Um... This just doesn't really
feel right.

19:21.192 --> 19:23.893
I just am feeling
a little exposed.

19:23.895 --> 19:25.327
You can leave your shirt on.

19:25.329 --> 19:28.130
No. No, all of it.

19:28.132 --> 19:30.065
I feel like you're doing this
to make me feel better

19:30.067 --> 19:31.934
about the other night,
and you don't need to.

19:31.936 --> 19:34.170
I said what I was feeling.

19:34.172 --> 19:36.972
What I am feeling.

19:36.974 --> 19:38.240
But I didn't say it so that you

19:38.242 --> 19:39.741
would say it back
or sleep with me.

19:39.743 --> 19:42.411
I said it because...

19:42.413 --> 19:44.013
I can't hold it in anymore.

19:44.015 --> 19:47.382
I don't wanna do this
unless you do.

19:47.384 --> 19:54.089
Because if we do this and you
don't feel it back...

19:54.091 --> 19:58.360
- Then I don't think that--
- That you can date me anymore?

19:58.362 --> 20:00.830
No.

20:00.832 --> 20:04.266
That I'd be able to get over
you, Jenna.

20:04.268 --> 20:06.101
I just want this to mean
something to both of us.

20:06.103 --> 20:10.072
And it would,
because I finally knew.

20:10.074 --> 20:12.074
I was in love.

20:12.076 --> 20:13.775
But I didn't wanna
say it in a minivan.

20:13.777 --> 20:15.110
It'll be worth the wait.

20:15.112 --> 20:16.578
I promise.

without a basket!

20:37.201 --> 20:38.901
Ally's lost half her body
weight along with her sanity.

20:38.903 --> 20:40.736
Change of plans, dude,
I don't need a suit.

20:40.738 --> 20:42.371
Good thing, 'cause
this might be cursed.

20:42.373 --> 20:43.939
Last time I wore it
was to the formal.

girl with that other guy?
