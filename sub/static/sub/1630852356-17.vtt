WEBVTT

00:01.749 --> 00:04.088
Hah! Ah-yatatata!

00:04.089 --> 00:06.008
Argh! [growling] Ptew!

00:06.009 --> 00:08.168
And that's
how you play can-punch!

00:08.169 --> 00:09.748
Seems easy enough. Hup!

00:09.749 --> 00:10.798
How's it going out here?

00:10.799 --> 00:12.168
Aah!

00:12.169 --> 00:15.798
Oooh! Gotta keep your eyes
on the cans, Remy.

00:15.799 --> 00:17.128
Now come on in,
it's time for dinner!

00:17.129 --> 00:18.838
Puh! Okay, Mr. Green!

00:18.839 --> 00:20.008
Yah yah!

00:20.009 --> 00:21.009
[Bill] You too, Cricket!

00:21.009 --> 00:22.009
Huh?

00:22.010 --> 00:24.088
Cricket, inside.

00:24.089 --> 00:25.918
- [whimpering]
- C'mon, boy. C'mon!

00:25.919 --> 00:27.458
Okay, get in here.

00:27.459 --> 00:28.708
Cricket, it's time to--

00:28.709 --> 00:30.088
What?! Hey! C'mere!

00:30.089 --> 00:31.168
Lemme down! Lemme down!

00:31.169 --> 00:32.588
I don't wanna!

00:32.589 --> 00:33.798
And you can't make meee!

00:33.799 --> 00:35.548
[hisses]

00:35.549 --> 00:38.548
Criminy, boy, I haven't seen you
act this way since you had--

00:38.549 --> 00:40.458
[gasp] the itch.

00:40.459 --> 00:41.878
The itch? What's that?

00:41.879 --> 00:43.248
You see, Remy,

00:43.249 --> 00:47.878
every year, Cricket
gets this wild urge.

00:47.879 --> 00:49.168
I can't say
I fully understand it,

00:49.169 --> 00:51.088
but one thing
usually does the trick.

00:51.089 --> 00:52.168
Camping.

00:52.169 --> 00:54.088
[echoing] Camping...

00:54.089 --> 00:55.338
Back in the country,
I'd take Cricket out

00:55.339 --> 00:56.958
deep in the woods,

00:56.959 --> 00:58.748
far from the eyes
of decent folks.

00:58.749 --> 01:00.838
[growling]

01:00.839 --> 01:02.628
[Bill] Once released,
Cricket was unleashed,

01:02.629 --> 01:04.588
free to follow
his animalistic instincts.

01:04.589 --> 01:06.168
Ha ha! Yeah!

01:06.169 --> 01:07.208
And to do things...

01:07.209 --> 01:08.958
Ahh...

01:08.959 --> 01:11.958
that would churn the stomachs
of civilized people.

01:11.959 --> 01:13.668
A yearly commune with nature

01:13.669 --> 01:16.338
is the only thing that can
cure the wildness in that boy.

01:16.339 --> 01:18.548
[Cricket sighs]

01:18.549 --> 01:21.048
Dad, that's it!
You gotta take me camping!

01:21.049 --> 01:24.008
Please please please!
Please, Dad! [laughing]

01:24.009 --> 01:25.458
Oooh, camping!

01:25.459 --> 01:26.958
I don't really get it,

01:26.959 --> 01:29.878
but if Cricket likes it,
I'm sure I will, too!

01:29.879 --> 01:31.088
Well, that settles it then.

01:31.089 --> 01:32.378
Tonight, boys, we camp!

01:32.379 --> 01:33.419
- Woohoo!
- Woohoo!

01:34.669 --> 01:36.088
Got my good beans.

01:36.089 --> 01:37.418
Now I'm ready for campin'!

01:37.419 --> 01:38.419
I'm so excited!

01:38.420 --> 01:39.838
You kids ready?

01:39.839 --> 01:41.378
Yeah! Race you
to the truck, Remy!

01:41.379 --> 01:43.008
Oh, we don't need
to take the truck.

01:43.009 --> 01:44.958
'Cause the campsite
is right here!

01:44.959 --> 01:47.008
[bleating]

01:47.009 --> 01:48.588
Are you serious?

01:48.589 --> 01:50.338
We're camping
in our dumpy backyard?

01:50.339 --> 01:52.458
Why ain't we going
somewhere more nature-y?

01:52.459 --> 01:54.588
Well, backyard camping
is fun, too.

01:54.589 --> 01:56.798
Listen. You can still hear
the harmony of nature.

01:56.799 --> 01:58.008
- [glass shatters]
- [cat screeches]

01:58.009 --> 01:59.458
[man] Time
for some night-yelling!

01:59.459 --> 02:01.878
Aaahh! Aaahh!

02:01.879 --> 02:04.128
Well, I can't say I love it,
but I'll give it a shot.

02:04.129 --> 02:05.878
Well, that's the spirit!

02:05.879 --> 02:08.208
At least we can get
a good ol' campfire going!

02:08.209 --> 02:10.048
Whoa whoa, hey, now!

02:10.049 --> 02:12.088
We don't want
the fire department
called on us!

02:12.089 --> 02:15.008
Are you kidding?
It's not camping
without a campfire!

02:15.009 --> 02:18.088
That's why I brought
a safe and respectful
alternative.

02:18.089 --> 02:19.089
Ta-da!

02:19.090 --> 02:21.418
Oooh!

02:21.419 --> 02:22.668
Grr!

02:22.669 --> 02:25.628
Why are you neutering
our camping trip?!

02:25.629 --> 02:27.628
Aw, come on, son.
It's just as good!

02:27.629 --> 02:30.128
We're still out in nature,
but we gotta be mindful.

02:30.129 --> 02:32.628
Because there are people
all around us.

02:32.629 --> 02:34.048
Watching us.

02:34.049 --> 02:36.208
Judging us.

02:36.209 --> 02:38.088
But I don't care
what people think!

02:38.089 --> 02:39.508
Shh! Quiet down!

02:39.509 --> 02:41.048
Use your inside voice.

02:41.049 --> 02:42.628
But we're outside!

02:42.629 --> 02:44.918
I can't control it anymore!

02:44.919 --> 02:47.128
[grunting]

02:47.129 --> 02:49.088
Aaawoooo!

02:49.089 --> 02:50.089
Easy now, Cricket!

02:50.090 --> 02:51.458
Oof! Cricket!

02:51.459 --> 02:53.088
Wait! Come back!

02:53.089 --> 02:54.838
Oh, geez!

02:54.839 --> 02:57.838
Okay, I know I'm new to camping,
but this is fun!

02:57.839 --> 02:59.958
Oh, no, this is bad.

02:59.959 --> 03:02.418
We gotta get Cricket back
before he wreaks havoc
on the city!

03:02.419 --> 03:04.458
- But how are we
gonna find him?
- [metal clangs]

03:04.459 --> 03:05.918
You won't.

03:05.919 --> 03:07.708
Unless you've got my help.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.168
Ma, why are you up in that tree?

03:09.169 --> 03:11.008
'Cause it's more dramatic!

03:11.009 --> 03:14.378
Luckily for you,
man-hunting is my specialty.

03:14.379 --> 03:16.338
All right, Ma, name your price.

03:16.339 --> 03:19.168
I want the living room TV
to myself on Tuesday nights.

03:19.169 --> 03:20.838
That's when my show is on.

03:20.839 --> 03:22.008
Well, you could just stream it.

03:22.009 --> 03:24.338
Shh! Fine.
You got yourself a deal.

03:24.339 --> 03:27.418
Hup! I'll bring the target
back dead or alive.

03:27.419 --> 03:29.128
No, Ma, definitely alive.

03:29.129 --> 03:30.418
This is your grandson, remember?

03:30.419 --> 03:31.748
Right, right.

03:31.749 --> 03:34.008
Let's go take him alive, boys!

03:34.009 --> 03:35.338
Camping!

03:35.339 --> 03:37.549
- [Bill] Come on!
- [Gramma] Ha Ha! Whoo!

03:38.959 --> 03:40.918
Phew! You have fun today,
Tilly-girl?

03:40.919 --> 03:42.168
Oh, yes, Mama.

03:42.169 --> 03:44.878
I never knew fire
could spread so quickly.

03:44.879 --> 03:45.879
Yeah. [chuckles]

03:45.880 --> 03:47.168
Don't tell your dad about that.

03:47.169 --> 03:49.008
Huh. Locked?

03:49.009 --> 03:50.508
They must've gone
to the store or something.

03:50.509 --> 03:52.008
C'mon, let's try the back door.

03:52.009 --> 03:53.128
I'm sure they'll be back soon.

03:53.129 --> 03:55.208
I'll just wait with ya.

03:55.209 --> 03:57.548
Looks like they were having
a backyard camping trip.

03:57.549 --> 03:59.298
Cricket even brought out
his good beans.

03:59.299 --> 04:03.048
Hey, Mama! Have you ever eaten
a s'more, "Tilly-style"?

04:03.049 --> 04:04.458
Can't say that I have!

04:04.459 --> 04:05.918
You take a couple crackers,

04:05.919 --> 04:07.508
a Tilly helping of marshmallows,

04:07.509 --> 04:10.378
and then... Ta-da!

04:10.379 --> 04:14.208
That looks almost as good
as my "Nancy-style."

04:14.209 --> 04:16.049
[chomping]

04:17.299 --> 04:19.008
[both laughing]

04:19.009 --> 04:21.009
[speaking with mouth stuffed]

04:27.589 --> 04:29.088
[Cricket growling]

04:29.089 --> 04:30.089
Aah!

04:30.090 --> 04:31.548
Need fresh air...

04:31.549 --> 04:34.298
Nature... Gotta be free!

04:34.299 --> 04:35.378
Ahh!

04:35.379 --> 04:37.049
Ooh!

04:38.129 --> 04:39.049
Shiny!

04:39.050 --> 04:41.088
Big shiny!

04:41.089 --> 04:42.668
That's not normal.

04:42.669 --> 04:43.958
Now, that boy's got
the right idea!

04:43.959 --> 04:47.168
No gods or kings, only moon!

04:47.169 --> 04:48.588
Mmmmm... Hm?

04:48.589 --> 04:49.668
[licking air]

04:49.669 --> 04:51.418
Muh-mah-- Muh-mah--

04:51.419 --> 04:53.628
Meeaat!

04:53.629 --> 04:54.839
[flirtatious giggling]

04:56.169 --> 04:57.298
- Meat!
- [both scream]

04:57.299 --> 04:58.838
[growling]

04:58.839 --> 05:00.588
Who is that dreadful boy?!

05:00.589 --> 05:02.008
Me Cricket Green!

05:02.009 --> 05:04.008
Son of Bill Green!

05:04.009 --> 05:05.798
Oh, he doesn't need
to advertise it!

05:05.799 --> 05:07.088
If we don't catch Cricket soon,

05:07.089 --> 05:08.628
the whole city
will think we're nuts!

05:08.629 --> 05:10.918
We need to surround him,
leave no room for escape!

05:10.919 --> 05:13.958
We must strike fast
and without hesitation!

05:13.959 --> 05:16.008
[growling]

05:16.009 --> 05:17.088
Huh?

05:17.089 --> 05:18.378
Ptew!

05:18.379 --> 05:20.588
Yaah! Dang it!
Don't let him through!

05:20.589 --> 05:22.048
- [grunting]
- Cricket, stop!

05:22.049 --> 05:23.588
You're coming with us, son!

05:23.589 --> 05:24.918
Aaaghhh!

05:24.919 --> 05:26.048
What a horrid little beast!

05:26.049 --> 05:27.918
Was he raised in a barn?

05:27.919 --> 05:30.088
Well, technically, yes,
but he's not usually like this.

05:30.089 --> 05:31.878
- You see...
- Uh, Mr. Green?

05:31.879 --> 05:33.128
Mr. Green?!

05:33.129 --> 05:36.548
Uh... Cricket?
It's me, Remy.

05:36.549 --> 05:39.298
Your best
and least-tasty friend?

05:39.299 --> 05:40.878
Raaaaaaaaah!

05:40.879 --> 05:42.089
[swooning]

05:44.249 --> 05:46.168
So you see,
with his country upbringing--

05:46.169 --> 05:47.958
Huh? W-wait, Cricket!

05:47.959 --> 05:49.748
- Get back here!
- [grunting]

05:49.749 --> 05:50.918
Clever boy.

05:50.919 --> 05:52.918
Wish his father was more clever!

05:52.919 --> 05:54.668
How'd you let him slip through?!

05:54.669 --> 05:57.798
I was just trying to do
some damage control!

05:57.799 --> 06:00.048
But when they
opened the closet...

06:00.049 --> 06:02.798
there was nothing but a head!

06:02.799 --> 06:04.668
Ha! Pretty scary, huh?

06:04.669 --> 06:06.168
Yeah, a little bit.

06:06.169 --> 06:07.668
Ha ha ha ha!

06:07.669 --> 06:10.008
Oh, man, the look
on your face, Tilly-girl!

06:10.009 --> 06:11.878
Why don't you
take a crack at it?

06:11.879 --> 06:14.958
Oh, no, I'm not too fond
of spooking others.

06:14.959 --> 06:17.418
Oh, c'mon,
I'm not and easy scare, hon.

06:17.419 --> 06:18.958
Well, if you insist.

06:18.959 --> 06:19.959
[clears throat]

06:19.960 --> 06:21.338
Imagine, if you will...

06:21.339 --> 06:23.748
waking up alone in an empty room

06:23.749 --> 06:25.248
with only one door.

06:25.249 --> 06:27.838
You open that door
to an identical room,

06:27.839 --> 06:29.338
but smaller.

06:29.339 --> 06:32.748
Every door you open leads
to an even smaller room.

06:32.749 --> 06:35.548
Your curiosity
compels you to keep going.

06:35.549 --> 06:37.208
Door after door,

06:37.209 --> 06:40.088
the walls keep coming
closer and closer.

06:40.089 --> 06:42.958
Until finally,
you can barely move.

06:42.959 --> 06:44.048
[frightened breathing]

06:44.049 --> 06:46.088
And try as you might,

06:46.089 --> 06:50.088
you still can't resist
going into the next room.

06:50.089 --> 06:52.628
O-kay!
That's enough scary stories!

06:52.629 --> 06:55.668
Oof! C'mon, Tilly,
this tent's feeling
a little cramped.

06:55.669 --> 06:56.958
I like it.

06:56.959 --> 06:58.628
Ohh, where am I?

06:58.629 --> 07:00.248
Oh, no!

07:00.249 --> 07:02.628
Cricket dragged me out
into the middle of nowhere!

07:02.629 --> 07:03.918
[pop music playing]

07:03.919 --> 07:06.088
Am I... in a nest?

07:06.089 --> 07:07.248
Oh, Cricket!
What's going on?

07:07.249 --> 07:09.668
What are you--
Hey, wait, where you going?

07:09.669 --> 07:12.418
[wild chanting]

07:12.419 --> 07:14.509
Cricket, why
did you bring me here?

07:16.299 --> 07:18.088
To free you.

07:18.089 --> 07:19.418
You join me wild.

07:19.419 --> 07:21.128
Chew stick!
Roam free.

07:21.129 --> 07:23.418
Oh, I don't know.
I'm a good boy!

07:23.419 --> 07:24.879
With a bedtime.

07:27.419 --> 07:29.129
Be wild. Be free.

07:30.129 --> 07:31.208
Like this?

07:31.209 --> 07:33.549
Yes! Now roar. To moon!

07:35.089 --> 07:36.508
R-roar?

07:36.509 --> 07:37.509
More loud!

07:37.510 --> 07:38.668
Rraarr!

07:38.669 --> 07:40.838
Oh! That felt good!

07:40.839 --> 07:41.918
Really good!

07:41.919 --> 07:43.418
Remy feel wild?

07:43.419 --> 07:45.088
Yes, I do!

07:45.089 --> 07:47.838
- Awoooooo!
- Awoooooo!

07:47.839 --> 07:50.628
[both chanting]

07:50.629 --> 07:53.168
Oh, great, he's converted
his little friend.

07:53.169 --> 07:55.378
Oh, why do they have
to be making such a racket?

07:55.379 --> 07:56.668
- [chanting]
- Hmm?

07:56.669 --> 07:57.878
Reeee! Reeee!

07:57.879 --> 07:59.298
Looks like the jig is up.

07:59.299 --> 08:01.008
Huh! Come quietly,

08:01.009 --> 08:03.378
or Gramma's gonna have
to use her big guns!

08:03.379 --> 08:04.798
Yaaah!

08:04.799 --> 08:06.748

C'mon, boys, let's just go home!

Wild good! Free boy!

08:13.009 --> 08:14.548

08:14.549 --> 08:16.088
No one gets away from me!

08:16.089 --> 08:18.008
Let's get you back
in your fancy pants.

08:18.009 --> 08:20.048
Hiyaah! Yaah!

08:20.049 --> 08:21.958
Wild boys! Wild boys!

08:31.919 --> 08:33.458
[grunts]

08:33.459 --> 08:37.378
But soft! What light
through yonder window breaks?

08:37.379 --> 08:40.748
It is the east.
And Juliet is the sun!

08:40.749 --> 08:41.878
Arise, fair sun--

08:41.879 --> 08:43.508
- Aaah!

08:43.509 --> 08:46.549
Oh, Terry, we didn't
practice for this!

08:47.919 --> 08:49.588
I said I don't do improv!

08:49.589 --> 08:51.708
- [growling]
- Aaaah!

08:51.709 --> 08:53.088
[angry shouting]

08:53.089 --> 08:54.168
Stand back, Billy-boy!

08:54.169 --> 08:55.338
I got this.

08:55.339 --> 08:58.298
No, Ma, I got this.

08:58.299 --> 09:00.748
[both shouting]

09:00.749 --> 09:02.418
That's it!
Kids, enough is enough!

09:02.419 --> 09:03.958
Society has rules for a reason!

09:03.959 --> 09:05.088
Unh! Hey!

09:05.089 --> 09:07.588
You will never stop wild boys!

09:07.589 --> 09:08.958
[Cricket and Remy]
Wild boys forever!

09:08.959 --> 09:10.588
Wild boys forever!

09:10.589 --> 09:11.748
No more!

09:11.749 --> 09:13.298
No! You not understand!

09:13.299 --> 09:14.878
Of course I understand!

09:14.879 --> 09:16.548
Do you think I like caring
what people think of me?

09:16.549 --> 09:18.918
I want to go wild, too!

09:18.919 --> 09:21.458
You do?
Then why not do?

09:21.459 --> 09:23.088
For once in life,

09:23.089 --> 09:24.918
do what make Bill happy.

09:24.919 --> 09:27.168
"Do what make Bill happy"?

09:27.169 --> 09:30.008
Do what make Bill happy.

09:30.009 --> 09:31.048
What's going on?

09:31.049 --> 09:31.959
He's not really gonna...

09:31.960 --> 09:33.588
Get ready, Big City!

09:33.589 --> 09:36.008
'Cause Wild Bill
is lettin' loose!

09:36.009 --> 09:38.588
Ahh hoo hoo!

09:38.589 --> 09:39.798
Woohoohoo!

09:39.799 --> 09:40.958
Yeah!

09:40.959 --> 09:42.628
- Woohoohoo!

09:42.629 --> 09:45.588
You, sir, have made a mockery
of community theater!

09:45.589 --> 09:47.168
Heh! Heh heh heh!

09:47.169 --> 09:49.588
It appears the prey
has won tonight.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.918
But I'm still getting
the TV Tuesday nights!

09:51.919 --> 09:55.668
Shakespeare must be rolling
in his grave, Terry!

09:55.669 --> 09:57.918
Huh. Can't really see
the stars in the city.

09:57.919 --> 09:58.959
Wait, there's one!

10:00.129 --> 10:02.128
Oh, it's just a helicopter.

10:02.129 --> 10:04.838
A man-made star
that hunts for the wicked.

10:04.839 --> 10:06.338
Hey, it's starting
to get real late.

10:06.339 --> 10:08.128
Where is everyone?

10:08.129 --> 10:09.588
Wait, do you hear that?

10:09.589 --> 10:13.008
[wild chanting]

10:13.009 --> 10:14.208
Whoo-whee!

10:14.209 --> 10:16.168
Well, look who's
finally moseyed on home!

10:16.169 --> 10:18.708
Yep! But the night
ain't over yet!

10:18.709 --> 10:20.049
- Woo-hoo!

10:21.089 --> 10:22.588
