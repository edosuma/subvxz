- Mm-hmm, he was being
a good husband last night

25:57.533 --> 25:59.700
'cause Scheana
was getting on my case

25:59.700 --> 26:02.300
and calling me fake because
she just can't understand

26:02.300 --> 26:05.333

my beef with Lala

26:05.333 --> 26:06.667

friends with her,

26:06.667 --> 26:08.433

really going in on me,

26:08.433 --> 26:10.600
and he came to my rescue.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.333
- Three years ago,

26:12.333 --> 26:14.266
if I heard the same
altercation going down,

26:14.266 --> 26:16.467
I'd probably just turn my cheek
and walk the other way.

26:16.467 --> 26:19.033
But Katie--
she's so cool now.

26:19.033 --> 26:20.533
I'm not about
to listen to Scheana,

26:20.533 --> 26:22.333

26:22.333 --> 26:24.233

my daughter--

26:30.333 --> 26:31.567

her like that,

26:32.767 --> 26:34.700

26:34.700 --> 26:37.500

34:25.266 --> 34:27.066
We had so much fun.

34:27.066 --> 34:29.734
- Aren't they at dinner
with Jax right now?

34:29.734 --> 34:31.400
- Jax, yes, right now.

34:31.400 --> 34:34.333
I hope my family's
ripping him a new asshole.

34:38.734 --> 34:45.367
♪ ♪

34:45.367 --> 34:48.066
- Hi, welcome.

34:48.066 --> 34:49.700
There we go.

34:49.700 --> 34:51.500
Now, would you like to start
with some sparkling water,

34:51.500 --> 34:53.066
or flat water
is okay for you guys?

34:53.066 --> 34:54.066
- Um...

34:54.066 --> 34:55.600
- Flat's probably, uh...

34:55.600 --> 34:57.166
- Flat, okay, sounds great,
I'll be right back.

34:57.166 --> 34:58.233
- Mm-hmm, thank you.

34:58.233 --> 35:00.100
I never had sparkling water.

35:00.100 --> 35:01.166
- It's soda water.

35:01.166 --> 35:02.367
both:
Oh.

35:02.367 --> 35:05.033
- Why don't they
just call it that?

35:05.033 --> 35:06.367
- Well, I'm glad
you guys could come.

35:06.367 --> 35:08.100
I know Brittany
was working tonight,

35:08.100 --> 35:09.734
so I really wanted to
take you guys out to dinner,

35:09.734 --> 35:11.567
and I hope you're enjoying
your time here so far.

35:11.567 --> 35:13.767
It's a little bit
chaotic right now.

35:13.767 --> 35:16.433
I know you guys know why.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.700
I'm happy Kristen
did what she did.

35:19.700 --> 35:22.100
I was a little
blindsided by that.

35:22.100 --> 35:25.667
I felt like she
should've told me.

35:25.667 --> 35:27.734
- Yeah, but she was only
thinking about Brittany.

35:27.734 --> 35:29.333
- 100%, I agree.

35:29.333 --> 35:31.000
I 100% disagree.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.633
Kristen Doute is the type
of person that wants

35:32.633 --> 35:34.333
to burn my relationship
right to the ground

35:34.333 --> 35:36.066
and ruin my life.

35:36.066 --> 35:37.133
She's got some kind
of weird obsession.

35:37.133 --> 35:38.400
Everyone says it.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.066
- So, do you think
we can talk about

35:40.066 --> 35:41.133
a little bit...
- Yeah, sure.

35:43.667 --> 35:45.200
- Oh yeah.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.100
Yeah, it was a one-time thing.

35:47.100 --> 35:48.133
- Did you like this person

35:48.133 --> 35:49.467
and want a relationship?

35:49.467 --> 35:52.233
- It had nothing to do
with liking her.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.767
It was just
the act of doing it,

35:53.767 --> 35:55.266
if that makes sense to you,
it's the act of it.

35:55.266 --> 35:57.133
If a ----ing squirrel
went up to me

35:57.133 --> 35:58.667
with a ----ing pussy,
I would've ----ed it.

35:58.667 --> 36:00.767
I just, I don't wanna
get too graphic with you

36:00.767 --> 36:03.667
as far as, like,
why I do these certain things.

36:03.667 --> 36:05.567
I'm still trying
to figure it out.

36:05.567 --> 36:08.033
- Maybe I need to know why
you do these certain things.

36:11.000 --> 36:12.433
- I'm not perfect by any means.

36:12.433 --> 36:14.367
I have a lot of issues.
I have a lot of things--

36:14.367 --> 36:16.266
I've gone down many,
many bad roads.

36:16.266 --> 36:17.700
I don't wanna,
like, sit here

36:17.700 --> 36:19.500
and harp on your daughter.

36:19.500 --> 36:21.300
I'm, like, not gonna do that,
it's just not nice.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.166
I was frustrated
with her lack of

36:23.166 --> 36:25.266
just motivation to do anything.

36:25.266 --> 36:26.667
I love Brittany
and the way she looks.

36:26.667 --> 36:29.033
This is not a reflection
of her body at all,

36:29.033 --> 36:30.400
but when you're
sleeping until 1:00,

36:30.400 --> 36:32.300
eating all day,
sleeping until 1:00,

36:32.300 --> 36:34.633
eating all day...

36:34.633 --> 36:36.367
- I think she does
a lot for you,

36:36.367 --> 36:39.133
but what do you really do,
like, with your time?

36:39.133 --> 36:41.700
- I'm--we're getting into
such small details right now.

36:41.700 --> 36:45.367
It's not the thing, but...

36:45.367 --> 36:47.133
I--the big picture is,

36:47.133 --> 36:48.700
is just I'm not a
mean person by any means.

36:48.700 --> 36:50.200
I'm not, I'm not--

36:50.200 --> 36:52.467
I don't do things
to hurt people, I don't.

36:52.467 --> 36:54.600
I have a lot of problems
with myself.

36:54.600 --> 36:56.700
It's not Brittany,
it's not anybody,

36:56.700 --> 36:58.200
it's not any other
girls I've ever dated,

36:58.200 --> 36:59.734
it's me and I know that.

36:59.734 --> 37:01.600
I'm not happy
with myself at all.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.166
Not even this much.

37:03.166 --> 37:04.200
- No.

37:04.200 --> 37:05.400
- Not even a little bit.

37:05.400 --> 37:06.600
- That makes me sad.

37:06.600 --> 37:07.600
- Makes me sad too.

37:07.600 --> 37:08.734
I bawl my eyes out.

37:08.734 --> 37:12.266
I'm a selfish, terrible person.

37:12.266 --> 37:16.433
- Jax, I have saw
a lot of good things in you.

37:16.433 --> 37:18.200
What you done,
you know, for my son.

37:18.200 --> 37:20.266
- Yeah.
- I will never

37:20.266 --> 37:22.467
forget what you done for...
- I'm so happy.

37:22.467 --> 37:23.533
- For Wes and Melisha.

37:23.533 --> 37:25.000
- Whatever we raise tonight,

37:25.000 --> 37:26.734
I am personally gonna match it.

37:28.667 --> 37:29.767
- Let's make a baby.

37:32.433 --> 37:33.734
- You know,
I'll give you a second chance,

37:33.734 --> 37:35.567
and I don't,
you know, give up on you,

37:35.567 --> 37:38.767
and you know I love you.

37:38.767 --> 37:40.633
Your plan didn't work?

37:40.633 --> 37:41.767
Aww, poor thing.

37:41.767 --> 37:43.233
- I'm believing in you.

37:44.433 --> 37:45.700
- Suck it, Kristen.

37:48.166 --> 37:49.600
- Coming up...

37:49.600 --> 37:51.200
- No one's a ----ing
true friend here,

37:51.200 --> 37:52.233
it's ----ing...

37:52.233 --> 37:53.500
- I'm so sorry, James.

37:53.500 --> 37:55.066
- No one,
everyone gets ----ed over.

38:02.400 --> 38:03.033
- ♪ You're gonna miss me ♪

38:04.767 --> 38:07.600
♪ Gonna miss me
when I'm gone ♪

38:07.600 --> 38:10.133
- I guess I'll just text James
and say he can come over here.

38:10.133 --> 38:11.767
- What is he gonna
come over and say?

38:11.767 --> 38:14.000
- I don't know,
that's between you guys.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.500
If you don't mind,
I'm not gonna be here for this,

38:15.500 --> 38:17.100
because I have enough
going on in my life.

38:17.100 --> 38:19.200
I don't wanna get
any more involved

38:19.200 --> 38:22.133
in James', you know,
sex scandal with Logan.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.767
I'd rather just go
to the grocery store,

38:23.767 --> 38:25.233
go get a haircut.

38:25.233 --> 38:26.633
- Okay, thank you.
- No problem.

38:26.633 --> 38:29.367
Hell, go get a root canal.

38:29.367 --> 38:31.133
- We have had a good time,
haven't we?

38:31.133 --> 38:32.400
- Heck, yeah.

38:32.400 --> 38:33.734
- What happened
with the dinner?

38:33.734 --> 38:36.266
- Um, I feel like
it went really well.

38:36.266 --> 38:38.100
I had a lot of different
emotions.

38:38.100 --> 38:40.000
And you know what makes me
so sad, Brittany,

38:40.000 --> 38:42.734
is 'cause he says, like, he's
just not happy with his self.

38:42.734 --> 38:45.233
He thinks he's
a terrible person.

38:45.233 --> 38:47.367
You know, and because
he can admit that,

38:47.367 --> 38:50.000
I mean, that
too goes a long way.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.433
I don't like what he's done,
I hate it,

38:52.433 --> 38:55.500
but, you know, I'm willing to--
to give him a second chance.

38:55.500 --> 38:57.266
- We're gonna support you.

38:57.266 --> 38:59.033
- Yeah.

38:59.033 --> 39:01.100
Come in!

39:01.100 --> 39:05.300
Hey, doggies.

39:05.300 --> 39:07.100
- Hi.
- Hello.

39:07.100 --> 39:08.233
What's up?

39:11.133 --> 39:14.500
- So, what's the drama,
what's the drama?

39:14.500 --> 39:16.266
- I mean,
you can tell the story.

39:16.266 --> 39:18.033
I mean, you know
what's been said.

39:18.033 --> 39:20.000
- No, what was said,
that's all I wanna know.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.266
- Okay, well, so I was like,

39:21.266 --> 39:22.667
what's wrong with you,
you know,

39:22.667 --> 39:24.667
and he's like, I'm upset
James isn't coming,

39:24.667 --> 39:26.400
and I said, well, why?
He's like,

39:26.400 --> 39:28.700
you don't know
that we're

39:28.700 --> 39:30.300
And I said--

39:30.300 --> 39:31.500
- Yes.

39:31.500 --> 39:33.133
- Okay.

39:33.133 --> 39:34.734
- Yeah, he was like,
welcome to Hollywood.

39:34.734 --> 39:36.066
- What a creep.

39:36.066 --> 39:37.467
- And he said, you know,

39:37.467 --> 39:39.166
if Raquel doesn't know,
she's an idiot.

39:39.166 --> 39:41.066
- Yes.

39:41.066 --> 39:42.567
- I kinda wanna just
call him right now.

39:42.567 --> 39:44.166
Don't say anything.

39:44.166 --> 39:45.200
I don't want him to know
that you're with me.

39:45.200 --> 39:46.200
- Okay.

39:48.000 --> 39:49.033
I'm nervous.

39:50.066 --> 39:53.333
- Hey, so not only did you
say that we were ----ing,

39:53.333 --> 39:56.533
but also you said,
"Welcome to Hollywood."

39:56.533 --> 40:00.000
That's what I've been told,
Logan.

40:00.000 --> 40:01.734
- By Brittany.

40:01.734 --> 40:03.533
- And Tiffany.

40:10.333 --> 40:11.567
- But...

40:13.133 --> 40:14.166
- But you don't--

40:18.633 --> 40:20.166
You just--

40:20.166 --> 40:21.700
how can we be friends
after this,

40:21.700 --> 40:23.200
after you just, like,

40:23.200 --> 40:25.100
completely try
and, like, ruin--

40:25.100 --> 40:29.100
ruin my, like, relationship?

40:29.100 --> 40:31.500
You have nothing to say
'cause you're ----ing ashamed.

40:31.500 --> 40:33.300
- 'Cause you're
a piece of sh--.

40:33.300 --> 40:34.700
'Cause you're a piece
of ----ing sh--, Logan.

40:36.100 --> 40:37.367
That's it.

40:37.367 --> 40:38.500
Well, at least
I know what he said now.

40:38.500 --> 40:39.767
- Yes.
- Thank you.

40:39.767 --> 40:41.166
- We just wanted you
to know the truth.

40:41.166 --> 40:42.367
I'm not even--

40:42.367 --> 40:45.333
I'm so, like,
past the whole...

40:45.333 --> 40:47.100
- I know.
I'm sorry.

40:47.100 --> 40:48.300
- Whatever the rumor was,
I don't even care now.

40:48.300 --> 40:50.200
- Yeah.

40:50.200 --> 40:51.500
- It's just that I feel like
I've lost a friend, you know?

40:51.500 --> 40:52.567
- I know.
- I'm sorry.

40:52.567 --> 40:54.233
- A true friend.

40:54.233 --> 40:55.767
But obviously he wasn't
a true friend, right?

40:55.767 --> 40:57.400
No one's a ----ing
true friend here,

40:57.400 --> 40:58.533
it's ----ing...

40:58.533 --> 41:00.000
- I'm so sorry, James.

41:00.000 --> 41:01.533
- No one,
everyone gets ----ed over.

41:01.533 --> 41:03.333
It wasn't even
the gay thing that

41:03.333 --> 41:04.667
pissed me off the most,
you know, it pissed me off

41:04.667 --> 41:06.367
that my ----ing friend
tried to bury me.

41:06.367 --> 41:07.533
I'll see you guys later.

41:07.533 --> 41:09.266
- Bye, James.
- See you.

41:09.266 --> 41:11.066
- It's not even some wanker.

41:11.066 --> 41:12.667
It's, like, it was Logan.

41:12.667 --> 41:15.533
- I felt bad for Logan, too,
because he is in love with him.

41:15.533 --> 41:17.333
Like...
- I know he is.

41:20.266 --> 41:21.533
- Hello.

41:21.533 --> 41:22.767
Hi, guys.

41:22.767 --> 41:24.400
- That was quick.

41:24.400 --> 41:26.133
- Yeah, he got really upset--

41:26.133 --> 41:27.367
James--and he cried
and everything.

41:27.367 --> 41:29.066
- Yeah.

41:29.066 --> 41:31.200
- Sounds like he put on
quite the performance.

41:31.200 --> 41:33.133
The car is here.
- Okay.

41:33.133 --> 41:35.266
- So, I will help you
with your bags.

41:35.266 --> 41:37.533
- Mommy,
I don't want you to go.

41:37.533 --> 41:38.667
I want you to stay.

41:38.667 --> 41:41.166
It's just been so, so awesome

41:41.166 --> 41:42.700
having my mom and sister here.

41:42.700 --> 41:44.700
Mm, I love you,
I don't want you to go.

41:44.700 --> 41:47.133
And it kind of makes me feel
better about my decision

41:47.133 --> 41:49.166
of trying to work
things out with him.

41:49.166 --> 41:50.567
It makes me
feel like forgiveness

41:50.567 --> 41:52.533
might actually be
the best decision here.

41:52.533 --> 41:53.667
- Bye.

41:53.667 --> 41:55.300
- I love you guys.

41:55.300 --> 41:57.166
- Okay, I love you too, honey.
- Love you.

41:58.367 --> 41:59.567
- Right here.
- Oh, okay.

41:59.567 --> 42:02.000
Hello.
Do we get in the back?

42:02.000 --> 42:03.367
- I literally have
everything I want.

42:03.367 --> 42:05.033
Call us when you land.

42:05.033 --> 42:06.033
I got my girl.

42:06.033 --> 42:07.300
Are you sad?

42:07.300 --> 42:10.033
- Yes, I am sad,
I don't want them to go.

42:10.033 --> 42:12.300
- And I got a cold case
of beer in the fridge.

42:12.300 --> 42:14.300
Nap time with babies.

42:14.300 --> 42:15.567
The end.

42:15.567 --> 42:17.233
- Exhausted.

42:19.400 --> 42:21.667
- Next time,
on "Vanderpump Rules"...

42:21.667 --> 42:22.667
Oof.

42:22.667 --> 42:24.033
There was a fire at Sur.

42:24.033 --> 42:25.467
[sirens wailing,
horns honking]

42:25.467 --> 42:27.033
- Oh, my gosh.

42:27.033 --> 42:28.567
- I don't think
we can open tonight.

42:28.567 --> 42:30.133
- My brothers
are coming to town.

42:30.133 --> 42:31.300
They've never seen LA.

42:31.300 --> 42:33.200
It's the
not-so-extreme makeover,

42:33.200 --> 42:34.333
triplet edition.

42:34.333 --> 42:35.600
Here we go.

42:35.600 --> 42:37.066
Whoo.

42:37.066 --> 42:38.133
Can we get a picture quick,
guys?

42:39.467 --> 42:41.600
- Stassi takes pride
in being ignorant.

42:41.600 --> 42:43.400
It's such a ----ing

42:43.400 --> 42:45.700
tough thing to say.

42:45.700 --> 42:48.066
- He was like,
you gained a lot of weight.

42:48.066 --> 42:51.033
I just don't know why he felt
comfortable saying that to me.

42:51.033 --> 42:52.667
- You are gorgeous.

42:54.166 --> 42:56.700
- You can learn Jax better.

42:56.700 --> 42:58.200
- You can call me Jason,

42:58.200 --> 43:01.033
try to push that
other person aside.

43:01.033 --> 43:02.633
- All right, Jason.

43:02.633 --> 43:04.367
- To see more
