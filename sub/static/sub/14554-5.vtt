Louie... **

00:32.433 --> 00:35.369
But I date now,
and I went on a date,

00:35.436 --> 00:38.506
and I get nervous when I date,
I get very nervous.

00:38.572 --> 00:40.074
I went on this date

00:40.141 --> 00:42.243
and we went out to
dinner and all these things

00:42.310 --> 00:44.712
and then I took her home
and she went inside

00:44.778 --> 00:48.116
and then I farted
for the rest of my life.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.050
I just...

00:50.118 --> 00:52.253
farted for
the rest of my life,

00:52.320 --> 00:54.355
as soon as she was inside.

00:54.422 --> 00:57.591
Young gorgeous women must have
the hardest time

00:57.658 --> 00:59.993
and a lot of people
think they have advantages,

01:00.060 --> 01:03.631
like, oh, if you're a pretty
girl, hey, you know, it's easy.

01:03.697 --> 01:04.932
People buy you drinks.

01:04.998 --> 01:07.135
Oh, wow, boy.

01:07.201 --> 01:10.104
What is that,
a $16 savings every week ?

01:10.171 --> 01:12.140
Free drinks.

01:12.206 --> 01:13.507
It must be so much
pressure to be,

01:13.574 --> 01:15.276
like, a really cute
young girl.

01:15.343 --> 01:17.678
First of all,
you're smaller than most people,

01:17.745 --> 01:19.580
you're adults,

01:19.647 --> 01:22.350
and you're walking around
and there's just massive men,

01:22.416 --> 01:24.084
like, three times your size
and they just--

01:24.152 --> 01:25.853
Every single--

01:25.919 --> 01:31.859
( grunting and groaning )

01:31.925 --> 01:33.527
That's a lot to
take on.

01:34.962 --> 01:38.466
Someone else's cum fantasy.

01:38.532 --> 01:40.401
Like, you--
he just looks at you

01:40.468 --> 01:43.337
and you just feel, just, buckets
of cum hit you on the face.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.379
( door creaking )

01:55.983 --> 01:56.917
Hey, hi.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.319
Hi.
Hey.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.388
What do you want to do?
Uh, I don't care.

02:00.454 --> 02:03.157
I know a good bar,
is that cool?
That's--
Yeah, sure.

02:03.224 --> 02:04.592
Good night, Seymour.

02:04.658 --> 02:05.826
My name's Roger.

02:07.761 --> 02:10.898
( rock music blaring )

02:25.078 --> 02:25.946
What do you
want to drink?

02:26.013 --> 02:27.781
Uh, drink...

02:27.848 --> 02:29.483
Uh, beer.

02:38.392 --> 02:40.828
Can I have a beer
and two Jagers?

02:40.894 --> 02:43.130
Honey, I'm not gonna
serve you two Jagers.

02:43.197 --> 02:44.698
What?

02:44.765 --> 02:46.667
Not after the last time
you were here.

02:46.734 --> 02:48.969
I'm not gonna start you
off two-fisted with Jager.

02:49.036 --> 02:50.771
I'm sorry.

02:50.838 --> 02:51.772
How about a white wine?

02:58.646 --> 03:00.614
Where are you--
You okay?

03:00.681 --> 03:01.915
What...

03:07.621 --> 03:10.057
What happened?

03:10.123 --> 03:11.959
It's too crowded in there.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.294
Yes, thank God.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.862
I hate when it--

03:14.928 --> 03:16.397
Places like that,
when they're all crowded.

03:18.632 --> 03:20.968
Hey, let's not go
to a bar.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.936
Do you need to
have a drink?

03:23.003 --> 03:24.538
I don't want to.

03:24.605 --> 03:27.074
Do you?
I'm fine with whatever.

03:27.140 --> 03:28.242
( horn honking )

03:28.309 --> 03:29.543
Can we walk?
Sure.

03:29.610 --> 03:31.279
Let's just walk!
Okay.

03:33.314 --> 03:35.048
My favorite part of New York

03:35.115 --> 03:37.685
is that you can just
walk and walk

03:37.751 --> 03:39.420
and you'll never
run out of city.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.121
Yeah, I love walking in
New York, I love it.

03:41.188 --> 03:42.656
You do?
Yeah, sure.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.957
Are you just saying that
because you're on a date

03:44.024 --> 03:45.793
you wanna agree with me?
Totally, I hate walking.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.528
See?
Don't do that.

03:47.595 --> 03:49.263
Just tell me
the truth.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.164
I like to disagree.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.833
Okay, well, then can we
get in a cab or go--

03:52.900 --> 03:54.768
No!

03:54.835 --> 03:57.004
I'm gonna make you walk.
Why, 'cause I'm fat?

03:57.070 --> 03:58.706
Yes.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.441
You're fat.

04:00.508 --> 04:03.243
And I have no tits.

04:03.311 --> 04:04.878
Let's be honest.

04:04.945 --> 04:07.315
It's the only way I'll
continue this date with you.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.251
Okay.

04:13.954 --> 04:15.456
You're just gonna have to
keep up with me

04:15.523 --> 04:17.725
because I reveal myself
very quickly to people.

04:20.561 --> 04:24.498
I had a carcinoma when I was 14,
I was supposed to die.

04:24.565 --> 04:26.767
You were supposed to die?
Yes!

04:26.834 --> 04:28.702
Did somebody say it to you
like that?
Someone-- Yes!

04:28.769 --> 04:31.071
They said it like that?
Someone actually
said that to me.

04:31.138 --> 04:33.674
So you--
They said it like that?

04:33.741 --> 04:35.876
I was in school, my parents
got a call from the doctors

04:35.943 --> 04:37.144
telling them the diagnosis.

04:37.210 --> 04:38.946
My mom...

04:39.012 --> 04:41.482
lost her mind, she came into
the school to just pull me out.

04:41.549 --> 04:43.116
I was walking from
home economics

04:43.183 --> 04:45.386
to science class to see my mom
standing in the school office,

04:45.453 --> 04:47.054
she's crying.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.822
My father's sitting next
to her, he's not mad at her

04:48.889 --> 04:51.659
and then this girl, this really
mean girl named Mandy Stewart,

04:51.725 --> 04:53.827
she sees me, she comes
up to me and she says,

04:53.894 --> 04:58.065
"Your mom is here
because you're supposed
to die or something."

04:58.131 --> 04:59.833
Oh, my God.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.234
It doesn't sound like
your mom handled that

05:01.301 --> 05:02.636
in the best possible way,

05:02.703 --> 05:04.472
from a parenting
point of view.

05:04.538 --> 05:06.640
Y'know, beating that disease
wore me down to 70 pounds.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.676
I had no hair,
my teeth fell out,

05:08.742 --> 05:11.645
I was wearing dentures
by the time I was 15.

05:11.712 --> 05:13.714
But the hardest part of it
was my mom,

05:13.781 --> 05:15.883
dealing with my poor mom
and getting her through it.

05:15.949 --> 05:18.919
I mean, I'd be...

05:18.986 --> 05:20.788
puking and she'd
be kneeling next to me

05:20.854 --> 05:22.556
on the bathroom floor,
sobbing.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.859
I mean, I'm literally puking
chemo vomit into a toilet

05:25.926 --> 05:28.161
and patting my
poor mother on the back,

05:28.228 --> 05:29.162
trying to comfort her.

05:29.229 --> 05:30.063
( chuckling )

05:32.265 --> 05:33.166
( horn honking in distance )

05:33.233 --> 05:34.835
I'm sorry I told you.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.770
I tell everything.

05:39.239 --> 05:40.608
I'm just glad
that you're okay.

05:40.674 --> 05:44.044
Can we go to this
vintage store?
All right.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.547
So when I got healthy again,
I couldn't be in school.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.416
And when you
go to hell and back

05:48.482 --> 05:50.518
and you literally see death

05:50.584 --> 05:52.520
come right into your face
like this

05:52.586 --> 05:54.622
and it turns you into
a little gray skeleton--

05:54.688 --> 05:56.189
I had one picture of me
from back then--

05:56.256 --> 05:57.525
I made my dad take it.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.127
I look like
a 90-year-old woman.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.062
And then death, you know,
backs away into the mist

06:02.129 --> 06:04.364
and...

06:04.432 --> 06:06.400
all the sudden,
my body's accepting nutrients

06:06.467 --> 06:09.036
and within a month,
I'm a healthy 15-year-old girl

06:09.102 --> 06:11.138
with a cool punky haircut.

06:11.204 --> 06:12.440
I mean, can you imagine?

06:12.506 --> 06:14.675
No, I can't.

06:14.742 --> 06:17.811
How do you sit and learn
algebra in a classroom,
you know?

06:17.878 --> 06:19.146
Why?

06:19.212 --> 06:21.181
I never went back.

06:21.248 --> 06:22.850
What did you do?
Oh, my God.

06:24.918 --> 06:26.086
Look at this.

06:27.988 --> 06:29.990
Will you try this on?

06:30.057 --> 06:31.124
No.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.060
Please.

06:33.126 --> 06:34.995
Are you being serious
right now?
Come on.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.131
Wait a minute, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait...

06:42.069 --> 06:43.937
Come on!

06:44.004 --> 06:45.072
Try it on.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.273
No.

06:46.339 --> 06:49.009
And... why?

06:49.076 --> 06:50.010
I don't know.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.545
I really don't.

06:51.612 --> 06:52.713
I've never asked a guy to do
anything like this.

06:52.780 --> 06:56.884
I-- Maybe it's a test.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.152
A test?
Yes.

06:59.219 --> 07:01.321
Do you like me?

07:01.388 --> 07:02.590
Yeah, I like you.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.757
Well, what do you
want to do?

07:03.824 --> 07:04.725
Do you want to
say a list of things

07:04.792 --> 07:06.660
you think might impress me

07:06.727 --> 07:09.296
or do you want to try this on
and make me really like you,

07:09.362 --> 07:11.765
just for having the guts?

07:11.832 --> 07:14.367
Plus, I think it'll look
pretty on you.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.269
Hey.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.772
I'm not making fun of you,
I promise.

07:18.839 --> 07:20.941
Come on.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.543
I mean, this is kind of sexy,
isn't it?

07:22.610 --> 07:23.911
Come on, try it on.

07:23.977 --> 07:26.547
Grow some guts.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.782
I'm gonna stand
right here and watch you.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.555
Look...

07:34.622 --> 07:37.257
I don't-- I don't care,
I'll try it on.

07:37.324 --> 07:38.626
I'll do it.

07:45.566 --> 07:46.800
( belt unbuckling )

07:50.270 --> 07:51.539
Okay, step in.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.092
Okay, turn around.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.400
( zipper zipping )

08:20.467 --> 08:21.935
Okay, turn around.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.576
( laughing )

08:31.645 --> 08:33.513
Uh-huh.
( laughing )

08:35.282 --> 08:37.551
Okay, okay.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.987
Okay, okay,
congratulations.

08:41.589 --> 08:43.657
No, no, no.

08:43.724 --> 08:47.027
Congratulations to you.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.697
Because you are
officially great.

08:54.001 --> 08:55.736
I'll wait for you
outside.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.879
Are you hungry?

09:05.946 --> 09:07.715
Yeah, very.
Hey, let's not eat.

09:07.781 --> 09:10.350
Stay hungry,
it'll sharpen your brain.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.852
All right.

09:11.919 --> 09:13.353
Can I ask you a question?

09:13.420 --> 09:14.822
You-- What?

09:16.523 --> 09:18.525
What is your name?

09:18.592 --> 09:20.393
Oh, my God,
we never did that.

09:20.460 --> 09:22.830
My name is Louie, hi.

09:22.896 --> 09:23.997
Louie.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.833
Louie, Louie.
Yeah, that's right.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.200
Okay.

09:27.267 --> 09:28.836
What's your name?

09:30.503 --> 09:32.105
( horn honking in distance )

09:34.207 --> 09:37.110
Tape Recorder.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.613
What?

09:39.680 --> 09:42.315
My name is Tape Recorder.

09:42.382 --> 09:44.785
My parents were fighting
about what to call me

09:44.852 --> 09:48.689
and when I was born,
they still hadn't decided.

09:48.756 --> 09:49.890
They just started
calling me that

09:49.957 --> 09:52.259
as something
to refer to me by

09:52.325 --> 09:54.795
until they could think--
think of a better name.

09:58.666 --> 10:00.133
They just never did.

10:02.970 --> 10:04.772
Why-- why "Tape Recorder"?

10:07.641 --> 10:12.445
I guess it was sitting on
my dad's desk...

10:12.512 --> 10:14.047
and they were fighting

10:14.114 --> 10:16.784
and he just pointed at it
and said,

10:16.850 --> 10:18.618
"We'll call
her that for now!"

10:21.689 --> 10:24.524
So that's my name.

10:24.591 --> 10:27.227
Wow, that is--
that's-- that's crazy.

10:27.294 --> 10:31.331
That's-- Tape Recorder?

10:31.398 --> 10:34.101
That's me.

10:34.167 --> 10:37.070
I mean, do people call you
"Tape," or...

10:41.942 --> 10:44.477
Is your name
really Tape Recorder?

10:44.544 --> 10:45.713
Shit.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.080
( giggling )

10:50.417 --> 10:53.320
Man.
Wow.

10:53.386 --> 10:56.223
You'll believe anything.
Why did you do that?

10:56.289 --> 10:57.858
I didn't do anything.

10:57.925 --> 11:01.461
I made a joke and you totally
took it seriously.

11:01.528 --> 11:03.797
Wow.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.665
I gotta be careful
with you.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.602
( laughing )

11:09.669 --> 11:10.871
Come on, Tape Recorder,

11:10.938 --> 11:12.706
let's go get
something to eat.
Okay.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.074
I know where to feed you.

11:14.141 --> 11:16.343
What is this?

11:16.409 --> 11:17.410
Is this good?
Hi.

11:17.477 --> 11:18.345
This is amazing.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.512
How are you?

11:19.579 --> 11:21.214
Hi.

11:21.281 --> 11:23.016
We're gonna try everything
that is your best.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.052
Two of these
Holland herring.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.155
Listen.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.591
Oh, my God.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.293
Oh, my God!

11:35.195 --> 11:36.396
Mmm, mmm.

11:42.970 --> 11:45.638
Look at that,
like space food.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.741
It looks like outer space.

11:47.808 --> 11:49.076
Oh, my God.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.483
Oh, Jesus.

12:11.765 --> 12:13.233
Best thing I ever ate.
Mm-hmm.

12:13.300 --> 12:15.435
Best thing I ever ate.

12:15.502 --> 12:17.771
Mmm, mmm.

12:17.838 --> 12:18.972
Give me that.
No.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.808
Give me your...
( laughing )

12:22.475 --> 12:24.978
This is so goddamn good.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.380
I can't believe I've never
been to that place before.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.749
Now aren't you glad now
that you never did?

12:29.817 --> 12:31.151
Yeah, I am.

12:31.218 --> 12:33.120
Have you ever been to
North Dakota?
No.

12:33.186 --> 12:34.822
Neither have I, but I want
to go to North Dakota

12:34.888 --> 12:36.489
more than
anything in the world.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.191
So why don't you go?

12:38.258 --> 12:40.527
I'll never go,
I just want to.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.862
I want to keep
desiring it.

12:41.929 --> 12:44.397
I love to
pine for North Dakota.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.834
I don't want to give that up
by going there.

12:46.900 --> 12:49.036
Why did you do that?

12:49.102 --> 12:50.437
Just...

12:50.503 --> 12:53.874
a more humane version of
throwing it in the garbage.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.243
'Cause you want to
help him?

12:56.309 --> 12:58.478
Yeah.

12:58.545 --> 12:59.847
Then let's do it,
let's help him.
What...

12:59.913 --> 13:01.915
Come on, yeah.
Wait a minute.

13:01.982 --> 13:03.884
I don't think a pickle's
gonna do it, though.
I gave him a sandwich.

13:03.951 --> 13:07.154
Hi, hi.
Oh, Jesus.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.189
Hey, honey,
how are ya?

13:09.256 --> 13:10.457
Why are you sleeping
out here?

13:10.523 --> 13:11.091
It's cold out here.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.393
( whispering )
Snakes.

13:13.460 --> 13:15.662
Snakes?

13:15.728 --> 13:16.997
Snakes.

13:17.064 --> 13:19.332
Why did snakes
make you be here?

13:19.399 --> 13:20.901
Why?

13:20.968 --> 13:22.870
They crawl on my legs.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.905
And the little ones
crawl on my hands.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.974
And the human services lady

13:27.040 --> 13:29.910
in Brooklyn got me that--
I had that job

13:29.977 --> 13:32.012
and then they
gave me these.

13:34.014 --> 13:36.917
And I know the snakes
aren't real,

13:36.984 --> 13:40.053
but I see 'em,
and I get scared and I start

13:40.120 --> 13:42.789
screaming and I cut my hands
'cause they're on my hands,

13:42.856 --> 13:45.926
but if take those,
they go away.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.227
And then I lost my job,

13:47.294 --> 13:49.196
I can't get 'em anymore
and the snakes come back

13:49.262 --> 13:52.465
and I just can't be
around people.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.367
Are these expensive?

13:54.434 --> 13:58.205
Yeah, $30 for one pill.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.107
Are you seeing snakes
right now?

14:05.245 --> 14:07.114
There's a snake on my face?

14:08.949 --> 14:10.884
They're not real.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.920
There's no snake.

14:15.822 --> 14:18.758
It's fine, you know,
there's no snake.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.593
I'm just saying,
there's no snake in--

14:22.462 --> 14:24.031
Okay, come on, buddy.

14:31.671 --> 14:32.940
Got it.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.415
( horn honking in distance )

14:55.295 --> 14:56.997
( horn honking in distance )

15:01.334 --> 15:03.236
Where are we--
where are we going?

15:03.303 --> 15:05.105
Just come on.
Where are we going?

15:05.172 --> 15:07.807
Come on, come on.
Come on, what are you--

15:07.874 --> 15:10.277
What are you doing, what are
you doing, what are you doing?
This is always open.

15:10.343 --> 15:11.711
What are you doing?
Come on!

15:11.778 --> 15:13.346
We can't just
go in a building.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.647
Hey, come on.

15:30.230 --> 15:33.500
Okay, look...
you have to pace yourself.

15:33.566 --> 15:36.436
It's a long way up, but I swear
to God, it's worth it.

15:36.503 --> 15:39.606
Boy, what are we...
Just breathe.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.941
One step at a time,
okay?

15:42.009 --> 15:44.044
How many stories is it?
I'm not telling you.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.478
If I told you,
you wouldn't do it.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.047
That's-- I'm not--
I'm not doing this.

15:47.114 --> 15:48.548
Yes, you are.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.218
Look, I'm 44 and I don't
exercise, okay?

15:51.284 --> 15:52.452
I have clogged arteries.

15:52.519 --> 15:54.321
Oh, wah, wah, wah.
Yeah, wah, wah, wah.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.423
That's what I'm--
That's what I'm saying.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.791
Let's do another thing,
come on.
No, Louie.

15:58.858 --> 16:01.995
You-- you put on
a dress tonight

16:02.062 --> 16:04.864
and you saved a man's life

16:04.931 --> 16:06.933
and you are
going to do this.

16:07.000 --> 16:07.967
Okay.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.302
Come on!

16:09.369 --> 16:11.804
One steps, two steps,
breathe.

16:11.871 --> 16:13.540
Okay, breathing.

16:13.606 --> 16:14.774
One step...
Ohh...

16:14.841 --> 16:16.009
Two steps.
Two steps.

16:16.076 --> 16:17.177
I'm fat.
Breathe.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.845
I'm fat.
No, you're not.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.313
Going up stairs.
Two steps.

16:20.380 --> 16:22.082
I'm going to die...
Breathe, breathe.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.583
... by going up
some stairs.
One step...

16:33.360 --> 16:36.096
Oh, goddamn it,
this is crazy.

16:36.163 --> 16:37.930
Come on, come on.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.832
We're not stopping now.

16:39.899 --> 16:41.634
Step, breathe.

16:41.701 --> 16:43.703
Step, breathe.

16:43.770 --> 16:45.472
Step, breathe.

16:45.538 --> 16:46.873
Step, breathe.

16:46.939 --> 16:48.475
Ahh!
Come on!

16:51.078 --> 16:52.612
( coughing )

16:56.549 --> 16:58.085
( wheezing )

16:59.752 --> 17:00.753
I gotta--
Just a second.

17:00.820 --> 17:01.821
No!

17:01.888 --> 17:03.590
No, no, no--
big mistake.

17:03.656 --> 17:05.258
You gotta keep going.
I can't--
I'm not doing this.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.327
I can't do this, I'm--
Do it!

17:07.394 --> 17:08.728
Do it!

17:08.795 --> 17:10.697
Get up, now!

17:10.763 --> 17:12.365
I mean it!
You got it, kid.

17:12.432 --> 17:14.267
Okay, we're going.
Step, breathe!

17:14.334 --> 17:16.769
All right, sport,
let's really do this.
Step, breathe.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.005
Okay.
Good.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.640
Okay.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.776
Louie, we made it.

17:26.012 --> 17:27.214
Look where we are.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.684
Oh, my God.
It's worth it, right?

17:31.751 --> 17:32.952
Not really.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.587
( both panting )

17:36.389 --> 17:37.390
Wow.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.661
Oh...

17:52.004 --> 17:53.306
Oh, that's not--

17:53.373 --> 17:55.108
Hey, can you please not
sit there and come over here?

17:55.175 --> 17:56.609
But this is the best part.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.010
Please don't--
No, no, no, no.
Come on!

17:58.077 --> 17:59.446
No, no, no,
please come away from there.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.047
Please just-- please just
come away from there.

18:01.114 --> 18:02.715
You can see everything
from over here.
No, no, no, no, no.

18:02.782 --> 18:03.950
Please don't sit like that,
don't-- don't--

18:04.016 --> 18:05.585
Please don't,
please-- please--

18:05.652 --> 18:07.019
That's--
Why?

18:07.086 --> 18:08.355
What are you afraid of?
Can you just come--

18:08.421 --> 18:10.790
Come on.
No, please,
that's too close.

18:10.857 --> 18:12.425
No, no, no, please don't do
that, please don't do that.
Come on!

18:12.492 --> 18:13.893
Please come away
from there.

18:13.960 --> 18:15.562
That's really upsetting me
right now,

18:15.628 --> 18:17.230
I swear to God-- no, no, no,
please don't, please don't.

18:17.297 --> 18:18.865
Do you know
why you're scared?

18:18.931 --> 18:21.100
Yeah, because falling
and it's high, so you'll die.

18:21.168 --> 18:22.869
Please come to where
you can't fall.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.171
I don't want you to fall.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.238
I want you to come where
it's impossible

18:25.305 --> 18:26.739
that falling can happen.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.276
But the only way I'd fall
is if I jumped.

18:33.546 --> 18:36.115
That's why you're afraid
to come over here.

18:36.183 --> 18:40.187
Because a tiny
part of you wants to jump

18:40.253 --> 18:42.189
because it would be so easy.

18:45.492 --> 18:47.627
But I don't
want to jump.

18:47.694 --> 18:48.661
So I'm not afraid.

18:52.765 --> 18:54.334
I would never do that.

18:58.104 --> 18:59.739
I'm having
too good of a time.

19:35.107 --> 19:37.377
Let's go home, okay?
Okay.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.617
My name is Liz.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.810
( no audio )
