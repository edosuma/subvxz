00:03.840 --> 00:06.400
<i>When I was a kid, my dad
pushed me out the window...</i>

00:06.480 --> 00:07.480
I told you I was sorry.

00:07.560 --> 00:09.016
You're just sick
and don't wanna admit it.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.633
<i>You weren't pushed.</i>

00:10.800 --> 00:12.120
You jumped.

00:13.920 --> 00:17.550
<i>We got the access we needed to
transfer the money from the bank's side.</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:18.790
<i>We can rob them blind.</i>

00:18.880 --> 00:20.600
<i>I don't want
Elliot to be my prisoner.</i>

00:20.640 --> 00:22.950
I want him
to be my partner.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.509
<i>I gotta break him
so I can build him up.</i>

00:25.600 --> 00:26.920
I see you now.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.992
<i>That is how
you own a nigga.</i>

00:29.080 --> 00:30.912
<i>I'm gonna break Elliot.</i>

00:31.000 --> 00:33.231
And you gonna be
my aluminum bat.

00:33.320 --> 00:34.754
<i>Mr. Robot.</i>

00:35.200 --> 00:37.396
That is how you break him.

00:37.480 --> 00:40.376
<i>Elliot, I was kidnapped.
He wanted to know everything about you.</i>

00:40.400 --> 00:42.392
The universe got
big plans for us, bruh.

00:42.520 --> 00:43.920
<i>I'm sorry.
I'm scared.</i>

00:44.200 --> 00:45.839
Hey. Hey! Hey!

02:26.560 --> 02:29.314
I've been waiting for
this moment for a while now.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.280
Sorry, I just...

02:39.440 --> 02:42.160
...didn't expect it
to hit me like this.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.959
I'm all emotional and shit.

02:45.080 --> 02:46.639
Told myself I'd
keep it cool, ya know.

02:46.720 --> 02:48.871
Told myself I wouldn't do
no fanboy shit like this,

02:48.960 --> 02:50.110
but I'm sorry, dude.

02:50.200 --> 02:53.034
I just have so much respect
for your ass, it makes me all...

02:56.360 --> 02:59.273
Yo, what's that word those
weird-ass Hasids use for this shit?

03:00.320 --> 03:02.835
- Verklempt?
- That's it. Verklempt.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.475
You, well,

03:08.080 --> 03:09.594
you like a hero to me.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.355
A hero I did wrong,
not gonna lipstick that pig.

03:14.440 --> 03:17.114
But it was a turning point
in my story, nonetheless.

03:17.200 --> 03:21.160
And something tells me it was
a turning point in your story, too.

03:31.160 --> 03:33.959
Javi, make our guest here
more comfortable.

03:45.720 --> 03:48.360
We're on the second floor
of a three-story walk up.

03:48.440 --> 03:51.717
Two armed dopes, and a crazy meth head
who thinks he's Deepak Chopra.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.310
Only exit's the front door,

03:53.400 --> 03:55.756
but I seem to remember
there's a fire escape in the back.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.391
I'm not thinking about
an escape plan right now.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.154
Escape is the only fucking thing
we should be thinking about.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.072
Not until we find Krista.

04:03.520 --> 04:07.833
Kiddo, need I remind you about
Dominican Psycho over here?

04:07.960 --> 04:10.919
Krista was just bait.
Now, she's probably dead.

04:11.080 --> 04:13.276
Well, we need to find out.

04:13.360 --> 04:17.115
I just need to get him doing
what he loves to do best... Talk.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.435
- He'll tell us what we want...
- Yo!

04:19.519 --> 04:21.192
You gonna say something?

04:25.040 --> 04:26.040
It's been a minute.

04:28.080 --> 04:29.275
How the fuck you been?

04:33.440 --> 04:36.080
Truth is,
I'm a little confused.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.515
You came looking for me
two months ago.

04:39.600 --> 04:41.637
Why'd you wait until today
to make a move?

04:43.400 --> 04:46.359
Well, if you must know,
I had to prepare.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.272
Set the stage for our meet.

04:50.240 --> 04:52.914
This shit is bigger than
Frost/Nixon, ya know?

04:54.920 --> 04:55.990
Had to be ready.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.116
Ready for what?

05:04.240 --> 05:05.913
For you, bruh.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.200
You a formidable adversary.

05:09.280 --> 05:12.273
You ain't no corner bitch
I can stick my dick in,

05:12.360 --> 05:14.431
need to buy you dinner first.

05:17.680 --> 05:19.717
That what this is, dinner?

05:20.160 --> 05:23.153
Shit, nigga, he tryin'
to make a metaphor.

05:23.320 --> 05:25.136
Yo, V, I thought you said
this kid a genius, bro...

05:25.160 --> 05:27.516
I swear to God, if you don't
shut the fuck up...

05:27.600 --> 05:30.911
How 'bout we just cut the bullshit
and you tell me why I'm here.

05:45.880 --> 05:47.280
After our unfortunate...

05:49.280 --> 05:51.192
...parting of ways,

05:51.280 --> 05:53.317
I had to return
back home, to the DR.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.790
Hadn't been back there
since I was little,

05:56.840 --> 05:59.116
when people didn't
think much of me.

06:00.040 --> 06:03.477
It actually reminded me
of a dream I used to have,

06:03.560 --> 06:05.597
that I would one day,
own that island.

06:05.680 --> 06:08.832
That the very land
everyone walked on,

06:08.920 --> 06:11.310
slept on, fucked on,
would be mine.

06:12.880 --> 06:15.315
Settle in, this looks like
it's gonna be a long one.

06:19.240 --> 06:23.632
Except, there I was,
back in the DR,

06:23.720 --> 06:26.360
with those same motherfuckers
who didn't believe in me,

06:26.680 --> 06:28.990
who said I wouldn't
amount to nothing.

06:29.200 --> 06:31.510
But this time,
they was wrong.

06:31.600 --> 06:32.716
I had tools now.

06:32.800 --> 06:35.793
I had vision I didn't have before.
So, I started hustling.

06:37.360 --> 06:38.360
I set up shop.

06:40.240 --> 06:43.278
A couple of corners here and there.
At first, on my own,

06:43.360 --> 06:46.478
then a few other niggas
got impressed, joined in.

06:46.560 --> 06:49.712
Couple of block battles,
but nothin' we couldn't handle.

06:49.800 --> 06:53.111
Matter of fact,
it was easier than ever.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.191
And like a virus,
we multiplied.

07:00.480 --> 07:04.110
Within 43 days,
I had took down every gang.

07:06.880 --> 07:09.839
From there, it was easy to
get to them politicians,

07:10.360 --> 07:13.194
especially with Five/Nine
poundin' their wallets.

07:14.360 --> 07:18.240
And once that domino fell,
we took control of all the favelas

07:18.320 --> 07:21.358
in both the Dominican
and Haiti.

07:24.200 --> 07:26.271
I was running
everything and everyone,

07:26.360 --> 07:28.431
from the president
to the campesino.

07:28.520 --> 07:32.070
By day 87, I finally had
my own island.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.952
Then, on the 88th day,

07:37.960 --> 07:39.155
I got bored.

07:40.400 --> 07:43.677
I had everything I ever wanted,
but all I felt was emptiness.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.195
One day, Javi over here brings me
this crazy old shaman

07:49.320 --> 07:50.549
who says he can help me.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.838
So, I says,
"A'ight, let him in."

07:54.520 --> 07:56.034
He sat my ass down,

07:56.160 --> 07:58.834
prepared me a cocktail
of this powder. Pink powder.

07:58.960 --> 08:01.634
Red blood mixed in
with titty milk.

08:01.720 --> 08:04.519
He looked into
my eyes and said,

08:04.600 --> 08:08.560
"You're asleep,
it's time you wake up."

08:11.280 --> 08:13.431
Then held the cup to my lips.

08:17.320 --> 08:19.551
You wanna know
what I did, Elliot?

08:21.000 --> 08:23.754
I gulped that shit down.
And then...

08:25.880 --> 08:29.032
I just gotta be real
with you, bruh. I shit myself.

08:30.120 --> 08:31.474
Then I puked myself.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.394
Back and forth, back and forth,
shitting, puking,

08:34.480 --> 08:37.678
'til all the shit and puke
poured out of me.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.871
This shaman then takes
my face in his hands and says,

08:42.600 --> 08:44.990
"It's time for you
to go home."

08:50.240 --> 08:52.277
I didn't know what to think.
I told him...

08:54.200 --> 08:55.429
...I was home.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.958
And then it hit me,

08:59.120 --> 09:02.238
why I was feeling empty
that whole time.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.120
Home isn't where you from,

09:06.600 --> 09:08.159
it's where you're
supposed to be.

09:10.960 --> 09:14.078
I was born Dominican,
but here...

09:17.200 --> 09:18.236
...New York...

09:24.320 --> 09:28.951
This is my home.
This is where I thrived.

09:29.040 --> 09:31.714
And there I laid,
weeping like a bitch,

09:31.840 --> 09:34.150
telling the shaman I could
never go back, I failed there,

09:34.240 --> 09:35.959
that path was closed to me.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.513
The shaman shook his head no.

09:42.000 --> 09:45.357
He told me
I had to reopen that path.

09:45.480 --> 09:47.153
That I had to reconcile

09:48.240 --> 09:49.720
with the man who closed it.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.717
For he was meant
to be my partner.

09:55.920 --> 09:58.310
Then, and only then,
can I go home again.

10:03.400 --> 10:07.280
That's why we sitting here
right now, Elliot.

10:09.520 --> 10:11.432
That's why I came back.

10:12.560 --> 10:14.153
I owned the wrong island.

10:17.320 --> 10:19.551
I'm gonna take over New York,

10:19.680 --> 10:22.912
and you gonna be
by my side when I do.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.634
So, whatchu think?

10:38.080 --> 10:39.992
Where's Krista?

10:56.640 --> 10:59.439
You want me to partner
with you for anything,

10:59.520 --> 11:02.160
first thing's first,
I need to know where Krista is.

11:02.240 --> 11:05.233
You forget we played this game already?

11:06.600 --> 11:08.398
That's why I'm asking.

11:15.080 --> 11:17.834
Now, that I think about it,
this was Isaac's knife.

11:18.960 --> 11:20.519
You remember him, don't you?

11:21.640 --> 11:22.676
My brother.

11:24.840 --> 11:27.958
This is probably the same one
he did your girl Shayla with.

11:34.720 --> 11:37.838
No one here wants to
see no rerun, bruh.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.272
You're not gonna kill Krista.

11:45.360 --> 11:47.238
She's the only thing
you got over me.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.711
Can't believe with
all that enlightenment,

11:52.800 --> 11:56.077
you'd come back here to be just
as stupid as you were last time.

11:57.920 --> 11:58.956
Stupid?

12:01.040 --> 12:02.440
Last time we did this dance,

12:02.520 --> 12:04.989
I got everything I wanted,
didn't I?

12:07.440 --> 12:09.352
You didn't get me.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.550
Where is she?

12:22.120 --> 12:23.554
She good, bruh.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.316
Show me.

12:43.920 --> 12:45.036
Poor Elliot.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.156
Always caught up worrying
about the pussy.

12:54.080 --> 12:55.355
Is that all you want?

12:57.120 --> 12:59.077
Simple meet and greet?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.000
Okay.

13:04.280 --> 13:06.511
But then after that,

13:06.600 --> 13:09.513
I'm gonna want my own
special introduction.

13:25.840 --> 13:28.435
- Elliot!
- Are you okay?

13:28.520 --> 13:32.309
No, no, no, we ain't having no sidebar here.
Alls I said was you could see her.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.720
You need to let her go.

13:38.440 --> 13:39.999
You already on
to your second demand,

13:40.080 --> 13:41.719
you ain't even
honor the first.

13:42.840 --> 13:44.957
I said I need an introduction.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.718
What introduction?

14:00.360 --> 14:01.680
Mr. Robot.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.274
- I don't know what you're talking about...
- Nah, come on, dude.

14:14.360 --> 14:17.432
Let's move past the bullshit.
I got your therapist here, remember?

14:17.520 --> 14:19.477
I know everything about you.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.591
So, tell me,
how do we get him out?

14:26.960 --> 14:29.794
How does this voodoo
shit work, exactly?

14:29.880 --> 14:34.397
Do we say "Mr. Robot" three times
in a mirror? Rub a lamp?

14:34.480 --> 14:38.156
Roll your eyes back, play Bob Marley,
light some candles?

14:38.240 --> 14:39.560
What do you want from him?

14:39.760 --> 14:41.717
Alls I wanna do
is talk to him.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.316
How about you let her go,
and then we'll talk.

14:50.320 --> 14:52.551
Remember what I said,
anything happens to her...

14:53.280 --> 14:54.280
Don't touch her!

14:54.800 --> 14:56.359
Don't worry,
I'm not touchin'...

14:58.000 --> 14:59.514
I'm just taking
her temperature.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.632
But Javi over here, he just got
outta a bad relationship.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.200
He need a rebound.

15:06.320 --> 15:09.916
He been looking at Miss Krista
all day with them hungry eyes.

15:10.040 --> 15:11.440
He gotta eat sometime.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.440
You can't blame him,
can you?

15:13.800 --> 15:15.473
We all gotta eat, Elliot.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.156
You wanna talk?

15:20.240 --> 15:21.240
Let's talk.

15:28.760 --> 15:32.470
How do I know it's you?
I didn't see no puff of smoke.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.991
Let's get one thing
straight, fuckface,

15:36.120 --> 15:37.440
I ain't no puff of smoke.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.032
Welcome to the party,
Mr. Robot.

15:57.120 --> 16:01.080
I'm not here to party.
You wanna talk, get to it already.

16:01.160 --> 16:02.719
- What do you want?
- Yo.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.176
I don't care who the fuck you are,
you need to calm it down, home.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.714
I'm not talking to you.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.552
Where that courage now, bitch?

16:19.200 --> 16:20.520
Right fucking here.

16:24.520 --> 16:25.715
Let's keep this friendly.

16:25.920 --> 16:27.991
- Yo, V, I ain't tryin'...
- Peanuts, God damn it,

16:28.080 --> 16:30.356
I said, "Put the gun down!"

16:39.720 --> 16:42.315
Kinda name is
Mr. Robot, anyway?

16:42.480 --> 16:44.073
It's Nickelodeon
bullshit, man.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.549
What kind of operation
you running here, exactly?

16:55.200 --> 16:56.270
What's so funny?

16:56.360 --> 16:59.080
Nothing, man,
it's just a trip.

16:59.160 --> 17:01.470
It's like I'm really talking
to another person.

17:01.560 --> 17:03.153
That's because you are.

17:03.240 --> 17:05.835
So, stop wasting my time
and start talking.

17:06.319 --> 17:07.470
I thought we was talking.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.358
What am I doing here?

17:09.520 --> 17:10.670
I don't know.

17:11.640 --> 17:12.868
That's a good question.

17:21.040 --> 17:25.353
Why are you...

17:29.360 --> 17:30.360
...here?

17:33.680 --> 17:36.673
When assholes
like you come around,

17:36.760 --> 17:39.320
I make sure he has
someone on his side.

17:39.400 --> 17:40.436
Oh...

17:40.520 --> 17:43.877
What that make you, then?
The muscle? His protection?

17:44.400 --> 17:45.516
Something like that.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.998
How you think that's going?

18:01.680 --> 18:03.478
Don't matter, though,

18:03.640 --> 18:05.677
I ain't here to judge
your job performance.

18:06.840 --> 18:11.073
I didn't ask what you do.
I asked you why you were here.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.078
How did you start?

18:21.440 --> 18:23.557
- He needed me.
- Why?

18:24.640 --> 18:27.951
If you here to protect him,
that means he got hurt real bad.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.656
I just wanna know
what scared him so much,

18:29.680 --> 18:32.070
that he needed your bitch ass
to come to the rescue.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.836
This is cute and all,
but I gotta be real with you.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.232
You're too stupid
to do this.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.056
What is it that
you think I'm doing, exactly?

18:43.080 --> 18:44.275
Tryin' to get inside my head.

18:44.360 --> 18:45.714
Oh, I already in there.

18:45.840 --> 18:47.593
- You're so sure of yourself.
- I am.

18:47.680 --> 18:49.000
Why's that?

18:49.480 --> 18:51.790
'Cause there's a method
to Elliot's madness,

18:51.880 --> 18:53.837
and I think
you know what it is.

18:54.040 --> 18:57.875
You wanna know what it is?
I'll tell you what it is.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.639
He's smart. He's angry.

18:59.720 --> 19:02.240
Put those two things together,
you stay the fuck out of the way.

19:02.280 --> 19:05.398
Yeah, blah, blah, blah, that's your
spin zone. <i>Fox & Friends.</i>

19:05.480 --> 19:07.517
How 'bout you give me
the real headline?

19:10.560 --> 19:11.914
You read her file.

19:12.440 --> 19:13.920
Put two and two together.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.390
His father died
when he was eight years old,

19:16.480 --> 19:20.315
his mother treated him
like her own personal ashtray.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.360
He needed someone
to help him cope with the world.

19:22.440 --> 19:23.556
<i>Voilà,</i> you got me.

19:23.680 --> 19:26.673
No doubt, shit's heavy,
but it ain't actionable.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.160
I need details.

19:28.440 --> 19:30.716
How 'bout we skip
the psychobabble

19:30.800 --> 19:32.871
and get to why
we're really here?

19:34.400 --> 19:38.189
You said you want to own this island
and you need my help.

19:39.840 --> 19:44.631
So, this job interview isn't
about my credentials, it's about yours.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.513
And, like I said,
with your operation,

19:47.600 --> 19:50.638
I don't know if you could
run a White Castle, much less New York.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.194
You want me
to work for you?

19:52.480 --> 19:54.915
It's clear you don't
wanna force me into it.

19:55.040 --> 19:57.600
Which means you gotta start
convincing me.

20:01.240 --> 20:02.913
Convincing you?

20:03.880 --> 20:05.234
Let's not play dumb.

20:07.080 --> 20:08.833
If she told you about me,

20:10.000 --> 20:13.152
I gotta think she told you
about Five/Nine.

20:14.160 --> 20:15.799
So, you know
the things I've done,

20:17.000 --> 20:19.310
things I've been able
to pull off.

20:20.440 --> 20:23.990
I am not someone you push
around with a gun, I am the gun.

20:24.200 --> 20:27.432
So, yeah,
you gotta convince me,

20:28.640 --> 20:32.316
because right now,
if this is your master vision,

20:32.680 --> 20:34.273
do yourself a favor.

20:34.360 --> 20:37.194
Go back to that little shaman
of yours and shit some more,

20:37.280 --> 20:40.079
because you're clearly
still full of it.

20:48.440 --> 20:51.717
I wanna own
every corner of this city.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.435
I want them all
pushing my product.

20:56.520 --> 20:58.876
And I mean everyone,
not just no drug dealers.

20:58.960 --> 21:02.556
Every business, every storefront,
every billboard in this city.

21:02.640 --> 21:05.758
Every train in every tunnel,
every pig in blue.

21:05.880 --> 21:08.315
From the night whores
walkin' the streets,

21:08.400 --> 21:10.357
to the day whores
on the Upper East Side.

21:10.440 --> 21:13.797
From the rapists down in lockup
to the ones in the high-rises.

21:13.880 --> 21:17.476
I wanna roll the five boroughs
into one Dominican blunt

21:17.560 --> 21:20.439
and smoke that shit
as I count my cash

21:20.520 --> 21:23.797
and ash on these Warbuckses'
white bald heads.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.997
That is my master vision.

21:26.080 --> 21:29.471
And that, Mr. Robot,

21:30.600 --> 21:33.877
is what I want.
I wanna own this island.

21:38.760 --> 21:40.831
So, let me see if I got this.

21:41.920 --> 21:43.513
You wanna get
into real estate?

21:45.840 --> 21:46.840
Is that it?

21:47.400 --> 21:49.551
Is that what
all this is about?

21:49.640 --> 21:52.712
Is that really your
groundbreaking epiphany here?

21:53.800 --> 21:57.510
No. That can't
really be it, is it?

21:59.320 --> 22:02.199
In your word salad, I heard
something about "drug dealing."

22:02.520 --> 22:05.035
Thing is, Pfizer and Eli
are a few billion ahead of you,

22:05.120 --> 22:06.190
and they can
buy your death

22:06.280 --> 22:09.352
with the same half-cent
it costs them to make a pill.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.637
You wanna get into billboards?
Download Photoshop,

22:11.720 --> 22:14.440
make yourself
a cute portfolio.

22:14.560 --> 22:16.074
Stores?

22:16.160 --> 22:18.736
With the debt everyone's in,
I'm sure they'll gladly give 'em to you.

22:18.760 --> 22:21.912
In which case, you'll just be
owned by their banks

22:22.000 --> 22:23.296
The trains are even
more bankrupt,

22:23.320 --> 22:25.676
and don't even get me
started on the NYPD.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.674
Even that blunt you wanna roll is gonna be
marked up by Big Tobacco itself.

22:29.840 --> 22:33.151
Point is, this city's one big,
fat credit card bill

22:33.240 --> 22:35.357
and you wanna pay it,
all so you can... What?

22:35.440 --> 22:37.352
Be another suit
with a mortgage?

22:38.440 --> 22:41.194
Unless you're after
a monopoly on stupidity,

22:41.680 --> 22:43.831
please tell me you have more.

22:44.040 --> 22:46.157
Please tell me
you didn't waste my time,

22:46.240 --> 22:48.176
when you could have just
enrolled in some night classes

22:48.200 --> 22:51.671
at the Brooklyn School of Real Estate
and left me the fuck out of it.

22:51.840 --> 22:56.039
This ain't about being
no landlord, bruh.

22:56.120 --> 22:57.952
This is about power.

22:58.280 --> 23:01.557
Power is just an asshole
stuffed with money.

23:01.680 --> 23:04.673
And while you're most definitely
all stocked up on asshole,

23:04.760 --> 23:05.989
money, you just don't got.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.514
I gots plenty startup capital.

23:07.600 --> 23:09.360
Whatever you have isn't enough.
Not for this.

23:09.440 --> 23:12.120
It ain't no thing, I can stick up
a few joints. How much we talkin'?

23:12.160 --> 23:15.278
Even asking that means
you're thinking too small.

23:15.440 --> 23:18.558
Behind every great fortune,
there lies a great crime,

23:18.640 --> 23:21.599
that is the corporate motto
of these United States.

23:21.720 --> 23:24.633
You wanna oink-oink with
all the other capitalist pigs?

23:24.840 --> 23:26.718
It's not about how much money.

23:27.960 --> 23:29.872
It's about robbing
money itself.

23:35.720 --> 23:37.279
And you can do that for me?

23:38.960 --> 23:41.236
I think I have a plan
that could help you.

23:42.360 --> 23:46.434
But step one of anything we do together
is always gonna be, let her go.

23:50.560 --> 23:53.519
But didn't you say she was
the only thing I got over you?

23:57.600 --> 23:59.080
Javi, Peanuts,

24:00.000 --> 24:02.071
am I deaf, or did
he not say that?

24:03.040 --> 24:04.554
Yeah, I heard it.

24:04.640 --> 24:06.279
Yeah, I heard it
most definitely.

24:06.560 --> 24:10.270
Hey, you need to recollect
correct, Nickelodeon.

24:11.280 --> 24:14.751
So, if I let my only
insurance policy go,

24:14.840 --> 24:18.197
then how am I gonna trust that
this money gonna come to me?

24:18.320 --> 24:21.392
Or that this plan of yours
even exists in the first place?

24:21.960 --> 24:25.670
You know, come to think of it,
she didn't even trust you?

24:25.880 --> 24:27.599
It was in her notes.

24:27.720 --> 24:29.439
Ain't that true,
Miss Krista?

24:30.520 --> 24:32.637
What was it again,
how'd you phrase it?

24:33.640 --> 24:35.950
"Patient is
extremely guarded,

24:36.040 --> 24:38.555
"which presents a barrier
to honest processing."

24:41.560 --> 24:43.711
That don't sound
too good, Mr. Robot.

24:46.360 --> 24:49.080
If she can't trust you,
why should I?

24:50.840 --> 24:51.910
I'll show you.

25:01.120 --> 25:02.554
Show me what?

25:03.040 --> 25:06.192
My plan. The hack.

25:06.280 --> 25:07.953
It's going down tonight.

25:09.120 --> 25:12.352
You let me do it, I'll steal more money
than you'll know what to do with.

25:12.440 --> 25:15.399
That'll be a better partner
to you than anyone else.

25:18.960 --> 25:21.680
Why you willing to part
with all this dough?

25:21.760 --> 25:23.320
I don't give a shit
about money.

25:23.680 --> 25:25.592
I just wanna
take it from them.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.039
How exactly are
you gonna do that?

25:34.920 --> 25:36.070
I'll show you.

25:42.480 --> 25:44.278
I got it all on my laptop.

25:45.040 --> 25:46.713
Bank statements,

25:47.000 --> 25:49.720
account balances,
the whole exploit.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.759
Javi, go get his bag.

26:21.840 --> 26:23.991
You know, you don't
need Mr. Robot.

26:29.720 --> 26:31.279
He barks a lot,

26:32.400 --> 26:36.030
but he ain't the bite behind
all that havoc you wreaked, is he?

26:42.320 --> 26:44.471
See, that right there,
that's why you my dude.

26:46.080 --> 26:47.878
I'm more scared
of you than him.

26:51.520 --> 26:53.034
You got somethin'
to show me,

26:54.360 --> 26:56.113
then let the show begin.

27:55.120 --> 27:57.635
Yo, Peanuts. Check this out.

27:58.800 --> 27:59.995
Oh, God.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.915
Look at all them zeros.
I can't even count 'em all.

28:07.920 --> 28:10.276
Oh, yeah. That's
stadium money, nigga.

28:10.360 --> 28:12.240
The fuck is "stadium money"?

28:18.600 --> 28:20.956
Yo, Javi, come take a look.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.239
Oh, shit.

28:29.760 --> 28:32.753
Yo, you right,
that is stadium money, bro!

28:32.840 --> 28:34.240
Oh! What the fuck!

28:34.320 --> 28:36.357
Jesus.

28:36.800 --> 28:37.995
Yo, you serious?

28:53.360 --> 28:55.033
You don't got it in you.

29:14.360 --> 29:16.750
I got your bullets, bitch!

29:22.640 --> 29:24.836
You really think I didn't have
Javi check your bag

29:24.920 --> 29:26.912
the second we grabbed you?

29:29.800 --> 29:30.800
Aww.

29:31.240 --> 29:34.199
Maybe I was wrong
about you, bruh.

29:35.400 --> 29:37.471
Old Elliot never would have
picked up that gun,

29:37.560 --> 29:38.789
let alone pulled the trigger.

29:38.920 --> 29:43.039
I like to think I had something to do
with that little mean streak in you.

29:43.560 --> 29:45.597
You make me proud.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.871
But I can see
we still have some work to do.

29:49.280 --> 29:50.760
It wasn't him, it was me.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.816
It was my fuck-up. You don't
need to take it out on him.

29:52.840 --> 29:55.480
Take it out on you, him,
the fuck does it matter?

29:55.560 --> 29:57.279
Same brain gets the bullet,
don't it?

29:57.360 --> 29:59.416
I had a lapse, doesn't mean
you give up on all those zeroes.

29:59.440 --> 30:00.954
That's still
very fucking real.

30:01.040 --> 30:04.511
Nah, man. None of this is real.
Not until we have trust.

30:04.600 --> 30:07.513
We can figure this out,
you just gotta put the gun down.

30:07.760 --> 30:10.150
Stop being so thirsty, bruh!

30:10.560 --> 30:12.677
I ain't tryin'
to talk to ya, anyway.

30:14.160 --> 30:15.196
Where you going?

30:17.640 --> 30:20.155
Let's go, sweet thing.
Let's go.

30:26.080 --> 30:27.150
Wait, stop.

30:27.400 --> 30:29.256
You wanna throw away
all that money for nothing?

30:29.280 --> 30:32.193
I'm not the one that just tried
to shoot me for no goddamn reason!

30:32.280 --> 30:34.320
No goddamn reason?
You would've done the same thing.

30:34.400 --> 30:37.791
Incorrecto, cuz! I woulda
made sure to kill your ass.

30:37.920 --> 30:39.656
Like I'm about to do to her.

30:39.680 --> 30:42.115
Hey, you hurt her,
you might as well kill me next.

30:42.200 --> 30:43.350
You lose everything.

30:43.440 --> 30:46.114
That does appear to be
the pickle we're in.

30:46.240 --> 30:48.835
So, what to do,
what to do?

30:48.920 --> 30:50.936
We go back to the plan
before I fucked everything up.

30:50.960 --> 30:54.192
Yesterday's news, bruh.
Been there, done that.

30:54.480 --> 30:57.075
Wait! Wait, wait!
After I steal the money,

30:57.240 --> 30:59.471
I'll be your partner. Okay?
I will be your partner.

30:59.560 --> 31:00.680
I will do whatever you want.

31:00.760 --> 31:03.514
Warmer, but not quite there since I know
for sure I can't trust you.

31:03.600 --> 31:06.320
Wait, wait, wait, wait! There's gotta be
something we can figure out.

31:06.400 --> 31:07.576
Tell me why
I shouldn't shoot her.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.193
Because she's a good person.

31:09.280 --> 31:10.656
No, tell me why
I shouldn't shoot her!

31:10.680 --> 31:11.955
She doesn't deserve this!

31:12.040 --> 31:13.440
Details, motherfucker!

31:13.520 --> 31:15.557
Tell me why
I shouldn't shoot her!

31:15.640 --> 31:16.915
Because I need her!

31:24.440 --> 31:25.715
She helps me.

31:31.040 --> 31:32.360
Oh.

31:33.120 --> 31:34.793
I get it now.

31:36.440 --> 31:37.760
She your shaman.

31:41.240 --> 31:43.311
What the fuck
does that mean?

31:45.120 --> 31:47.589
It means now,
we're getting much warmer.

31:47.680 --> 31:50.354
See, I've been goin'
about this the wrong way.

31:51.520 --> 31:54.194
I thought you would give me
the answer I was looking for.

31:57.200 --> 32:01.035
But maybe I was the wrong person
asking the question.

32:18.880 --> 32:19.880
Have a seat, bruh.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.119
What is this?

32:24.200 --> 32:26.635
We gonna have
a little therapy session.

32:26.840 --> 32:28.035
It's finally time you saw

32:28.120 --> 32:30.840
that you and I
are destined to be partners.

32:32.720 --> 32:33.756
You ready?

32:35.760 --> 32:38.275
Didn't I tell you
to sit your ass down?

32:42.200 --> 32:45.432
We gonna find out what's going on
inside that little head of yours,

32:46.280 --> 32:48.112
ain't that right,
honey bear?

32:49.480 --> 32:51.472
What do you expect me
to do, exactly?

32:51.880 --> 32:54.520
I expect you to pick up
where you last left off.

32:58.000 --> 33:01.038
Why you lookin' at me like that?
Don't you do this for a living?

33:01.160 --> 33:02.920
- Yes, but...
- I don't wanna hear no "buts."

33:03.760 --> 33:06.958
Alls I wanna hear, is this therapy
session gettin' kicked off.

33:09.200 --> 33:11.795
You sick, sadistic
piece of shit.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.232
What's the point of this?
You're just gonna kill us anyway.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.231
It's fine, Krista.
Let's just do what he wants.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.216
Elliot, he's just trying
to find another way to hurt you.

33:21.240 --> 33:23.471
He just wants a show.

33:23.600 --> 33:25.671
- Let's give him a show.
- That's right.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.437
I'll be sitting right here,
eating my popcorn.

33:36.280 --> 33:39.318
What you're asking for
is impossible.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.909
You won't get anything
out of this.

33:42.040 --> 33:46.273
This only works
in a controlled setting.

33:46.360 --> 33:47.396
Alone,

33:48.400 --> 33:50.869
just me and him.

33:55.440 --> 33:58.080
Peanuts, Javi, take a walk.

33:58.680 --> 33:59.716
What?

34:00.720 --> 34:03.918
Nah, nigga, now,
I wanna know what happens.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.515
Yeah, dawg, I'm kinda curious
where you goin' with all this...

34:06.600 --> 34:08.637
I said take a fucking walk!

34:19.280 --> 34:20.793
Nasty cabbage ass,

34:21.239 --> 34:22.833
had to go on
and ruin everything.

34:32.520 --> 34:34.989
That's as alone
as you gonna get.

34:35.120 --> 34:36.873
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

34:36.960 --> 34:38.056
You're pointing a gun at me,

34:38.080 --> 34:39.735
you're forcing me to talk
to one of my patients...

34:41.159 --> 34:42.674
Okay, okay, calm down.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.911
Krista, look at me.

34:47.199 --> 34:48.953
Ask me some questions.

34:49.639 --> 34:51.656
It's easy, you know how to do this,
same as we always do.

34:55.280 --> 34:56.873
Come on, Krista.

34:57.040 --> 34:59.032
It's fine. Pretend
he's not even here.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.552
Listen to your boy.

35:02.160 --> 35:03.560
Come on, you can do it.

35:04.120 --> 35:05.600
Look at me.

35:06.240 --> 35:07.469
Let's talk about my mom.

35:08.680 --> 35:11.752
She just passed away.
Why don't we talk about that?

35:15.040 --> 35:16.872
Are you okay?

35:17.960 --> 35:19.030
I'm fine.

35:20.200 --> 35:24.831
You know, we didn't talk a lot,
so, it didn't hit me that hard.

35:26.440 --> 35:28.193
I think it got
to Darlene, though.

35:31.840 --> 35:33.559
Come on, keep going.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.357
There's gotta be something more
you wanna ask me.

35:38.040 --> 35:40.919
Now, that you've had some time
to think about it,

35:43.200 --> 35:46.079
how are you feeling
about her death?

35:47.800 --> 35:49.598
I haven't thought
about it that much.

35:51.360 --> 35:53.352
Is that a bad thing?

35:55.080 --> 35:56.958
There was a lot of pain there.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.310
- She hurt you...
- Yeah, yeah!

36:00.400 --> 36:03.552
I know all this!
That's all old shit.

36:03.760 --> 36:07.640
There's no gold there.
I need that 24-karat.

36:07.760 --> 36:10.116
I don't know how to do
what you want.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.759
You said Elliot's
got a secret,

36:11.840 --> 36:15.516
and the only way I can unlock it is
to find out why Mr. Robot exists.

36:20.720 --> 36:21.915
What's he talking about?

36:23.000 --> 36:25.160
She sold us out,
is what he's talking about.

36:25.760 --> 36:28.753
I'm sorry, I had to tell him something.
I didn't know what else to say.

36:31.440 --> 36:32.954
What did you tell him?

36:33.040 --> 36:34.856
Look, we are running
out of time here.

36:34.880 --> 36:37.315
We gotta start thinking about
an exit strategy and fast,

36:37.400 --> 36:38.550
while his pals are gone.

36:38.800 --> 36:40.776
- Do you know what she's talking about?
- What does it matter?

36:40.800 --> 36:42.336
Did you hear what I said?
We gotta get out of here!

36:42.360 --> 36:45.239
- Here, let me help you start.
- Those are my private charts.

36:45.320 --> 36:48.081
"Elliot's preoccupation with Mr. Robot
suggests an emotional component

36:48.120 --> 36:49.616
- "to the relationship..."
- Don't do this.

36:49.640 --> 36:52.633
Oh, you're upset. I'm sorry.
Maybe I should stop.

36:52.720 --> 36:54.120
How 'bout it, Elliot?

36:54.200 --> 36:56.510
You sure you don't wanna know
what she wrote in here?

36:56.600 --> 36:59.160
He's fucking with you. He's trying
to play his little mind games.

37:01.360 --> 37:03.397
She doesn't want me
to hear this.

37:07.880 --> 37:10.600
- Why?
- Who gives a shit?

37:10.680 --> 37:12.478
We gotta focus
on a way out of here!

37:14.520 --> 37:16.671
You don't want me
to hear this, either.

37:21.680 --> 37:23.160
Keep reading.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.311
No. Don't do this.
Elliot, it's not a good idea...

37:25.400 --> 37:27.073
I said, keep reading.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.992
Ooh, I like this one.

37:30.080 --> 37:32.754
"Strained relationship
with Mr. Robot.

37:32.840 --> 37:36.151
"Keeps us from exploring
the root of his condition."

37:37.200 --> 37:38.429
What does that mean?

37:40.040 --> 37:41.554
Answer the man's question.

37:41.640 --> 37:42.835
Tell me what that means!

37:43.480 --> 37:45.597
Elliot, this is not how
this is supposed to work.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.273
She's right, this has to stop.

37:47.360 --> 37:50.194
"Childhood trauma.
Follow up on window event."

37:54.480 --> 37:57.120
What's so important
about this window, anyway?

38:01.720 --> 38:02.790
You won't talk.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.035
No problem, lemme look it up.
Let's see, window...

38:06.120 --> 38:08.874
Stop it. Just stop it!
These are just my notes.

38:09.080 --> 38:11.197
You're not supposed to hear
any of this in this way.

38:11.280 --> 38:14.318
I don't give a shit
what I'm supposed to hear!

38:14.400 --> 38:15.516
What are you hiding?

38:18.120 --> 38:19.600
Is this about Mr. Robot?

38:21.960 --> 38:23.872
No, not Mr. Robot.

38:24.320 --> 38:25.390
Darlene?

38:26.360 --> 38:27.476
No.

38:28.200 --> 38:30.271
- Who then?
- Don't say anything.

38:30.360 --> 38:32.670
What does this have
to do with the window?

38:32.760 --> 38:34.433
No one was there
except my father.

38:36.800 --> 38:38.473
Is this about my father?

38:42.240 --> 38:44.056
- What about him?
- Please don't make me do this.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.912
- What about him?
- Don't make me do this.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Krista, don't...

38:47.080 --> 38:48.673
Shut up!

38:48.840 --> 38:52.072
Krista. There's no use
holding back.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.560
Tell me what's going on.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.719
The day he pushed you
out the window...

38:58.800 --> 39:00.837
My dad didn't push me.
I jumped.

39:00.920 --> 39:02.752
Darlene told me.
I remembered it wrong.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.136
See, she doesn't even
know what she's...

39:04.160 --> 39:05.389
I said shut up!

39:09.560 --> 39:10.630
Keep going.

39:10.720 --> 39:12.473
Let's get it, bruh!

39:16.320 --> 39:20.075
Why is it you think you can't
recall that memory so clearly?

39:23.000 --> 39:26.232
Pay attention, Miss Krista's
askin' you questions.

39:26.600 --> 39:28.876
I don't know why. Do you?

39:32.240 --> 39:35.916
- Answer me.
- I don't know, but I...

39:37.720 --> 39:41.111
I could ask you details about
that day to help you remember.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.880
Like what?

39:44.440 --> 39:46.671
What were you doing
that day in your room?

39:48.680 --> 39:50.480
Darlene and I
were building a snowman.

39:50.560 --> 39:53.712
We went upstairs
to look for my camera.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.234
And did you find the camera?

39:57.080 --> 39:58.560
Darlene told me we didn't.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.916
What else did Darlene say?

40:03.320 --> 40:06.631
She said that we heard
my dad coming,

40:06.720 --> 40:08.837
and I told her
to hide in the closet.

40:10.480 --> 40:12.199
Then what happened?

40:13.960 --> 40:15.076
Uh...

40:15.160 --> 40:18.073
He walked in the door
and I grabbed my baseball bat.

40:18.960 --> 40:20.713
And then?

40:21.040 --> 40:23.157
I started swinging it,

40:23.240 --> 40:26.517
and yelling, smashing everything
in the room.

40:26.640 --> 40:28.518
And then I jumped
out the window.

40:29.440 --> 40:33.036
Do you actually remember these events,
or did Darlene tell you this?

40:34.960 --> 40:35.996
Darlene.

40:37.560 --> 40:42.191
Is that similar to other instances
in your life when you've lost time?

40:45.600 --> 40:48.274
Only when
Mr. Robot takes over.

40:49.520 --> 40:51.000
Do you think it's possible

40:52.080 --> 40:55.073
Mr. Robot is the reason
why you can't remember?

40:58.760 --> 41:03.118
What's she talking about?
You didn't exist when I was a kid...

41:04.320 --> 41:05.320
Did you?

41:07.280 --> 41:11.115
That's not important.
What's important, is that I'm here now!

41:11.200 --> 41:13.351
Stop lying to me,
how long have you been here?

41:13.440 --> 41:15.477
Don't you see
what's happening?

41:15.560 --> 41:18.200
She pushed us apart before,
she's doing it again.

41:18.280 --> 41:20.476
Answer the question!
How long?

41:21.040 --> 41:23.236
How long have you been
messing with my head?

41:23.320 --> 41:25.118
What do you want me to say?

41:25.320 --> 41:28.074
I've been here since the first day
that I was needed.

41:28.160 --> 41:31.437
I exist for a reason,
I always have!

41:31.520 --> 41:33.989
It's always been my job
to protect him.

41:34.400 --> 41:37.120
You know this isn't the way.
This is dangerous.

41:37.200 --> 41:38.793
You can't do this to him!

41:38.880 --> 41:43.352
Please! Do not do this to him!
He's not supposed to know!

41:47.520 --> 41:49.000
Know what?

41:52.440 --> 41:56.116
Elliot. Do you believe Mr. Robot
when he says he's here to protect you?

42:00.440 --> 42:01.476
Yes.

42:03.520 --> 42:07.070
So, if it's possible that it could
have been Mr. Robot that day,

42:07.760 --> 42:09.911
do you know why he might have
picked up that bat

42:10.000 --> 42:12.117
and jumped out that window?

42:12.200 --> 42:14.840
Why are we going through
all these details again?

42:14.920 --> 42:15.956
Get to the fucking point!

42:16.040 --> 42:18.874
That's it, bruh,
find that poison.

42:20.720 --> 42:24.634
Do you think Mr. Robot was protecting you
from something in that moment?

42:30.760 --> 42:31.989
Like what?

42:34.040 --> 42:37.112
You said you did this when your father
came into the room.

42:43.680 --> 42:45.512
Elliot, look at me.

42:49.520 --> 42:52.354
Why do you think
you had such a strong reaction

42:52.760 --> 42:55.195
when your father
came into the room?

43:10.400 --> 43:11.516
I don't know.

43:14.400 --> 43:15.595
I can't...

43:18.680 --> 43:19.909
I can't remember.

43:23.720 --> 43:24.790
Elliot?

43:31.160 --> 43:32.355
Maybe...

43:35.360 --> 43:36.840
...I was scared.

43:39.360 --> 43:41.033
What were you scared of?

43:42.360 --> 43:43.430
Krista,

43:44.960 --> 43:48.158
you do this,
it will destroy him.

43:48.760 --> 43:50.194
Elliot. What were
you scared of?

43:50.280 --> 43:53.079
- He already told you that he can't...
- Remember.

43:55.600 --> 43:56.875
His father.

44:07.840 --> 44:10.560
That's it, right?
You were scared of your father.

44:12.960 --> 44:14.030
No.

44:15.240 --> 44:17.072
Why would I be
scared of him?

44:18.200 --> 44:19.350
He was my friend.

44:29.160 --> 44:31.629
I can't protect you anymore.

44:44.320 --> 44:46.516
Why would I be
scared of my father?

44:49.880 --> 44:51.473
Do you recall a time

44:54.240 --> 44:56.152
your father ever hurt you?

44:57.720 --> 44:58.870
Hurt me?

45:00.280 --> 45:01.839
He would never hurt me.

45:03.240 --> 45:07.075
I told you,
he was my friend.

45:08.160 --> 45:09.560
He was my only friend.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.276
Then what made you
scared that day?

45:18.920 --> 45:20.036
I wasn't.

45:21.520 --> 45:23.989
You told me you were scared.

45:26.440 --> 45:27.715
I, uh...

45:28.600 --> 45:29.829
I said...

45:33.080 --> 45:34.150
Um...

45:35.360 --> 45:37.192
I'm confused.

45:42.200 --> 45:44.078
You and your sister
were in the room.

45:48.440 --> 45:50.318
You heard
your father's footsteps...

45:53.600 --> 45:54.600
No.

45:56.920 --> 46:01.199
You think it's possible you hid Darlene
in the closet to keep her safe?

46:03.400 --> 46:04.400
No.

46:07.200 --> 46:08.759
Your dad walked
into the room.

46:14.760 --> 46:15.830
No.

46:17.560 --> 46:19.791
You grabbed a bat
to defend yourself.

46:19.920 --> 46:21.479
No, no, no, no.

46:24.080 --> 46:25.230
No.

46:26.720 --> 46:28.996
You yelled at him
to get away,

46:29.120 --> 46:31.635
- you swung the bat at him...
- No.

46:34.360 --> 46:36.795
And you escaped
the only way you knew how.

46:44.960 --> 46:47.031
Why were you afraid
of your father?

46:55.200 --> 46:58.113
Were you afraid he was going
to ask you to do something

46:59.960 --> 47:01.360
you didn't want to do?

47:19.920 --> 47:20.920
Yes.

47:25.600 --> 47:27.990
Do you remember
what he asked you to do?

47:43.240 --> 47:44.594
Yes, I remember.

47:48.400 --> 47:49.436
Elliot...

47:52.720 --> 47:54.837
Did your father
sexually molest you?

48:05.160 --> 48:06.310
Yes.

49:07.480 --> 49:10.200
Elliot, I'm so sorry
that happened to you.

49:16.240 --> 49:17.833
Elliot. Hear me, bruh.

49:19.360 --> 49:21.795
I know it feels like
you're all alone right now,

49:21.880 --> 49:27.080
but you're not.
I know this pain, your pain.

49:27.160 --> 49:29.152
It's okay to feel
whatever you're feeling.

49:30.320 --> 49:32.357
And if you can hear me,

49:32.440 --> 49:35.239
I want you to know you don't
gotta be scared no more.

49:37.280 --> 49:39.511
Don't.
Don't touch me.

49:41.160 --> 49:42.310
Don't touch me.

49:55.240 --> 49:56.879
- My brother.
- Stop!

49:58.000 --> 49:59.480
Please, stop.

49:59.600 --> 50:01.990
You know, there's nothing
you can do to stop this.

50:03.920 --> 50:05.639
I don't know how
to live with this.

50:07.320 --> 50:08.640
I don't wanna live with this.

50:08.720 --> 50:10.439
- Not an option you got.
- Yes!

50:11.200 --> 50:15.672
Yes, there is!
There is! There has to be!

50:15.760 --> 50:17.752
Because I can't do this.
I can't...

50:18.080 --> 50:20.834
I know it hurts right now,
but you're purging all that poison.

50:20.920 --> 50:23.071
Soon, you can be
your true self.

50:24.200 --> 50:25.270
My true self?

50:27.320 --> 50:29.357
I don't know who that is.

50:30.480 --> 50:31.994
I don't know who that is!

50:32.200 --> 50:35.750
That's because you're still holding in
all the anger and sadness.

50:37.760 --> 50:39.080
What do I do?

50:44.520 --> 50:46.796
Right there, that's what you do!
You let it out!

50:49.440 --> 50:50.635
Amen!

50:53.440 --> 50:55.272
Once you let it all go,

50:55.360 --> 50:57.477
then you can finally
meet the real you.

51:01.800 --> 51:03.120
This ain't a death.

51:04.920 --> 51:06.877
Elliot, you been reborn.

51:10.480 --> 51:11.550
Why?

51:14.280 --> 51:17.830
Why would he do...

51:17.920 --> 51:19.559
There is no why.

51:20.800 --> 51:23.190
You weren't
the one in control.

51:25.680 --> 51:28.991
I know it's hard to go on
when you're carrying this around,

51:29.080 --> 51:30.275
but you can.

51:33.280 --> 51:34.396
How?

51:35.920 --> 51:37.400
You don't carry it alone.

51:39.840 --> 51:41.559
I'm here with you, bruh.

51:46.400 --> 51:47.550
You...

51:51.480 --> 51:53.711
You did this.
You did this to me!

51:56.120 --> 51:57.474
I did it for you.

51:57.600 --> 52:00.240
No, no, I don't
believe you!

52:00.320 --> 52:03.392
I did this because I could see
this wound on your face

52:03.680 --> 52:05.160
from the first time
I met you.

52:05.240 --> 52:07.072
I just wanted
to show you the light.

52:07.160 --> 52:09.834
- This is bullshit!
- Ain't no bullshit, bruh!

52:10.160 --> 52:13.198
The only thing that happened just now
is that you finally faced the truth

52:13.280 --> 52:16.034
you been looking away from
your whole life.

52:22.560 --> 52:24.392
And now, that you
know the truth,

52:26.560 --> 52:27.835
you can use it.

52:38.800 --> 52:40.553
I know 'cause
I've done it.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.435
I've been through it.

52:45.640 --> 52:46.756
My ma...

52:48.800 --> 52:50.757
...she used to pass me
around to her friends

52:50.840 --> 52:53.912
when she'd go out to get high.
And let's just say, her friends...

52:56.640 --> 52:58.359
...they took a lot from me.

53:02.080 --> 53:04.311
Your dad, he took
a lot from you, too.

53:05.680 --> 53:07.911
But he didn't
take everything.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.391
See, this shit
you went through,

53:11.480 --> 53:14.837
most people don't know
pain like that, they never will.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.595
And if they did,
it would end them.

53:20.240 --> 53:22.709
But the people who dig in,

53:22.800 --> 53:24.519
the ones who keep surviving,

53:24.600 --> 53:26.353
those are the ones
you can't beat.

53:26.440 --> 53:27.954
Those are the ones
no one can beat.

53:29.480 --> 53:32.791
Because once you've weathered
a storm like yours...

53:35.440 --> 53:37.671
...you become the storm.

53:41.360 --> 53:42.555
You hear me?

53:43.920 --> 53:47.311
You are the storm.

53:55.000 --> 53:58.277
And it's the rest of the world
that needs to run for cover.

54:06.040 --> 54:08.077
Your power is beautiful.

54:10.600 --> 54:11.716
Elliot,

54:13.520 --> 54:14.715
it's special.

54:21.080 --> 54:22.514
Don't you believe that?

54:25.160 --> 54:26.310
I don't know.

54:29.200 --> 54:30.634
Do you wanna believe it?

54:35.560 --> 54:36.630
I just...

54:41.160 --> 54:42.719
I don't wanna be
alone anymore.

54:45.280 --> 54:46.430
Hey...

54:52.200 --> 54:53.395
You're not alone.

55:06.680 --> 55:08.433
I see you now.
