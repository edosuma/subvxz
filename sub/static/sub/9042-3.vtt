00:53.967 --> 00:55.967

IT'S MAKING ME CRAZY, CRAZY

WHAT?
COME ON!

02:29.800 --> 02:31.733
WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

02:31.733 --> 02:35.467
- SORRY TO DISTURB YOU,
YOUR HIGHNESS.

02:35.467 --> 02:37.200
BUT WHILE YOU WERE
UP HERE READING

02:37.200 --> 02:41.033
YOUR LATEST
KISS-HANDSOME-BOYS BOOK

02:41.033 --> 02:43.600
AND RUBBING LOTION
ON YOUR BUNIONS...

02:47.300 --> 02:49.633
THE PEASANTS
WERE DOWNSTAIRS

02:49.633 --> 02:54.367
TRYIN' TO BUILD AN OCEAN
IN A SHOEBOX.

02:54.367 --> 02:56.100
- ARE YOU COMPLAINING?

02:56.100 --> 02:57.400
- AM I COMPLAINING?

02:57.400 --> 02:59.833
I JUST DID HOMEWORK
FOR TWO HOURS.

02:59.833 --> 03:03.567
- WELL, THEN I GUESS THAT MAKES
THE SCORE 3 MILLION TO TWO.

03:06.767 --> 03:09.633
- WHAT, ARE YOU
KEEPIN' TRACK NOW?

03:09.633 --> 03:12.800
THAT IS SO PETTY.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.700
- LOOK, RAY, THEY TOLD US
THAT ALLY WAS GONNA GET

03:14.700 --> 03:16.367
A LOT MORE HOMEWORK
IN THE 5TH GRADE.

03:16.367 --> 03:17.933
I'M GONNA NEED
MORE HELP FROM YOU NOW.

03:17.933 --> 03:19.267
- [groans]
ARE YOU KIDDING?

03:19.267 --> 03:21.800
COME ON,
I WAS DOWN THERE ALL NIGHT!

03:21.800 --> 03:23.100
- WELL, THIS IS WHAT WE DO.

03:23.100 --> 03:24.733
IT'S CALLED
"BEING A PARENT."

03:24.733 --> 03:28.167
- WELL, MAYBE I DON'T WANT
TO BE CALLED THAT.

03:28.167 --> 03:29.600
IT'S JUST--

03:29.600 --> 03:33.200
IT'S JUST
SHE HAS TOO MUCH HOMEWORK.

03:33.200 --> 03:34.967
DID YOU SEE HOW MANY BOOKS
SHE HAS TO CARRY?

03:34.967 --> 03:38.100
SHE'S GONNA BE
A HUNCHBACK.

03:40.567 --> 03:43.700
- YOU KNOW, YOUR CONCERN
FOR ALLY IS TRULY HEARTWARMING,

03:43.700 --> 03:45.900
BUT THIS WHAT MISS PURCELL
GIVES THEM.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.467
- MISS PURCELL, YEAH.

03:47.467 --> 03:49.467
I KNOW THE TYPE.

03:49.467 --> 03:52.333
"MY LIFE IS MISERABLE,
CHILDREN, SO GUESS WHAT--

03:52.333 --> 03:54.567
I'M TAKIN' YOU DOWN WITH ME!"

03:56.533 --> 03:59.200
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THIS WOMAN,

03:59.200 --> 04:00.700
THEN MAYBE YOU SHOULD
TALK TO HER.

04:00.700 --> 04:03.233
- MAYBE I WILL.
MAYBE I WILL DO EXACTLY THAT.

04:03.233 --> 04:05.400
- GOOD.
TUESDAY IS OPEN SCHOOL NIGHT.

04:05.400 --> 04:08.033
- WHAT?

04:08.033 --> 04:10.400
- THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU TO GIVE MISS PURCELL

04:10.400 --> 04:13.433
A PIECE OF THAT HUGE MIND
YOU'VE GOT THERE.

04:15.800 --> 04:18.133
- MISS PURCELL.

04:18.133 --> 04:20.267
MISS PUR-SMELL.

04:25.200 --> 04:26.667
- AND YOU CAN SEE
THAT THE CHILDREN

04:26.667 --> 04:29.000
HAD A WONDERFUL TIME
WITH OUR SCIENCE PROJECT.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.933
THESE ARE THE OCEAN BOTTOM
ENVIRONMENTS THEY CREATED.

04:31.933 --> 04:33.600
all: OOH.

04:35.533 --> 04:38.200
- LOOK, LOOK, RAY,
THERE'S ALLY'S, SEE?

04:38.200 --> 04:40.633
- GREAT, I BUST MY HUMP.
SHE PUTS MINE IN THE BACK.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.067
- YOU CAN ALL KEEP
LOOKING AROUND.

04:44.067 --> 04:45.433
LET ME KNOW
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

04:45.433 --> 04:48.767
- OKAY, RAY, HERE'S YOUR CHANCE.
GO AHEAD.

04:48.767 --> 04:53.000
- WHAT? FOR WHAT?
- TO TALK TO THE TEACHER.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.967
- WHY DON'T YOU?

04:54.967 --> 04:57.367
- YOU KNOW, I'M CONFUSED, RAY.

04:57.367 --> 04:59.400
I THOUGHT YOU HAD A BIG,
IMPORTANT COMPLAINT TO MAKE

04:59.400 --> 05:02.667
BECAUSE YOU CARED SO MUCH
ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER'S EDUCATION.

05:06.067 --> 05:07.600
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

05:07.600 --> 05:11.667
- OH, YEAH. NO.
SHE LOVES WHEN I DO MY RABBIT--

05:15.700 --> 05:18.567
- I WANTED TO LET EVERYONE KNOW
THAT OUR NEXT CLASS PROJECT

05:18.567 --> 05:21.333
IS GOING TO BE
A LARGE 3-DIMENSIONAL MURAL.

05:21.333 --> 05:22.767
WE'LL ASSEMBLE IT
IN EARLY DECEMBER

05:22.767 --> 05:24.433
SO THAT EACH CHILD
CAN WORK ON THEIR SECTION

05:24.433 --> 05:27.000
OVER THE THANKSGIVING BREAK.

05:33.533 --> 05:35.200
- OH, MY GOD.
THANKSGIVING.

05:35.200 --> 05:38.300
IT'S LIKE SHE HATES AMERICA.

05:38.300 --> 05:42.700
- DID YOU GET STUCK MAKING
THAT OCEAN CRAP TOO?

05:42.700 --> 05:44.433
- YEAH.
YUP.

05:44.433 --> 05:46.433
- THIS ONE'S MINE.

05:46.433 --> 05:47.867
- THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

05:47.867 --> 05:49.467
WHAT'D YOU USE FOR SHRIMP?

05:49.467 --> 05:50.767
- SHRIMP.

05:55.567 --> 05:58.467
- TOMORROW THAT'S NOT
GONNA BE TOO PLEASANT.

05:58.467 --> 06:02.033
- A LITTLE TIME BOMB
FOR MISS PURCELL.

06:04.167 --> 06:08.133
- HEY, DON'T YOU THINK THE KIDS
JUST GET TOO MUCH HOMEWORK?

06:08.133 --> 06:09.833
- [scoffs]
YOU ARE SO RIGHT!

06:09.833 --> 06:12.133
LINDA'S BEEN UP PAST 10:00
EVERY NIGHT.

06:12.133 --> 06:13.533
- IT'S OUT OF CONTROL.

06:13.533 --> 06:15.200
WE NEVER USED TO GET
THIS MUCH HOMEWORK.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.567
- YOU SEE, DEBRA?
IT'S NOT JUST ME!

06:17.567 --> 06:18.867
TALK TO MY WIFE.

06:18.867 --> 06:20.400
- I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ME.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.233
BILLY'S BEEN SO SWAMPED
I HAD TO CANCEL CELLO AND LATIN.

06:22.233 --> 06:26.067
- THAT'S TERRIBLE.
THOSE ARE GOOD THINGS!

06:26.067 --> 06:28.267
- DOES MISS PURCELL EVEN KNOW
WHAT SHE'S DOING TO US?

06:28.267 --> 06:29.867
- YOU KNOW,
I THINK MAYBE

06:29.867 --> 06:31.833
SOMEBODY SHOULD DEFINITELY
SPEAK UP, DON'T YOU THINK?

06:31.833 --> 06:33.400
[all talking over each other]

06:33.400 --> 06:35.500
- ...DON'T TELL ANYTHING BAD.
[gulps]

06:40.667 --> 06:43.133
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

06:43.133 --> 06:45.433
- GO AHEAD, RAY.

06:45.433 --> 06:46.967
- NO, NO, NO.
IT'S NOTHING.

06:46.967 --> 06:49.400
IT'S JUST SOME OF THE PEOPLE
WERE THINKING

06:49.400 --> 06:55.833
THAT MAYBE THERE'S
A LITTLE TOO MUCH HOMEWORK

06:55.833 --> 06:57.900
YOU KNOW,
FOR THE KIDS--

06:57.900 --> 07:01.367
EVERYBODY'S KIDS...

07:01.367 --> 07:03.500
MAYBE.

07:03.500 --> 07:05.500
- WELL, IT'S WHAT
THE DISTRICT THINKS IS NECESSARY

07:05.500 --> 07:07.900
FOR THE CHILDREN TO KEEP PACE
WITH THE CURRICULUM.

07:07.900 --> 07:12.967
- OH, CURRICULUM.
CURRICULUM.

07:12.967 --> 07:15.200
- YOU KNOW,
WE HAVE A MEETING MONDAY

07:15.200 --> 07:16.600
WITH THE CURRICULUM
REVIEW BOARD,

07:16.600 --> 07:19.033
AND THEY ALWAYS WELCOME INPUT
FROM PARENTS.

07:27.467 --> 07:29.800
- OKAY, WELL,
GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

07:29.800 --> 07:32.000
YEAH.
[shrieks]

07:35.133 --> 07:36.733
- YOU KNOW WHAT,

07:36.733 --> 07:39.967
I THINK RAY WOULD BE
A PERFECT SPOKESMAN FOR US.

07:39.967 --> 07:41.167
- HEY, I SECOND THAT!
- YES!

07:41.167 --> 07:42.400
- NO, NO!
NO, NO.

07:42.400 --> 07:44.533
A SPOKESMAN--A SPOKESMAN
SHOULD BE A GUY

07:44.533 --> 07:46.267
WHO'S NOT AFRAID
OF PUBLIC SPEAKING.

07:46.267 --> 07:48.467
I'M--I'M WETTING MYSELF NOW.

07:57.367 --> 07:59.500
- I THINK YOU'RE BEING
TOO HARD ON YOURSELF.

07:59.500 --> 08:01.800
- WAY TOO HARD.
- OH, YES.

08:01.800 --> 08:03.233
- WE COULD REALLY USE YOU.

08:03.233 --> 08:04.933
IF WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE
THE 5TH GRADE WORKLOAD,

08:04.933 --> 08:07.167
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO TELL THEM WHAT TO CUT.

08:07.167 --> 08:10.100
- YOU KEEP SAYING "WE."
I'M QUITE A BUSY FELLOW.

08:10.100 --> 08:11.967
- WELL, YOU HAVE
ALMOST A WEEK.

08:11.967 --> 08:13.300
WE JUST NEED YOU
TO READ THROUGH

08:13.300 --> 08:15.133
THE CURRENT CURRICULUM
AND FIGURE OUT

08:15.133 --> 08:17.600
WHERE YOU FEEL
IT'S REDUNDANT.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.833
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW VALUABLE
YOUR INPUT IS GOING TO BE.

08:20.833 --> 08:24.133
- YEAH, BUT, YOU SEE,
I'M NOT A TEACHER; I'M NOT--

08:24.133 --> 08:25.767
- WHEN THE TEACHERS
BRING THIS UP,

08:25.767 --> 08:27.733
THE BOARD JUST THINKS
WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT OF WORK.

08:27.733 --> 08:30.033
BUT THEY KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE
WHEN IT COMES FROM A PARENT.

08:39.933 --> 08:43.200
[electronic chirping]

08:43.200 --> 08:45.500
- COME ON.

08:45.500 --> 08:47.500
YOU GOT
A BETTER CONTROL.

08:50.000 --> 08:51.600
OH--HEY! HEY!
YOU BLEW ME UP!

08:51.600 --> 08:55.767
WE'RE ON THE SAME SIDE.
I'M NOT A ZOMBIE!

08:55.767 --> 08:57.867
- NOBODY BELIEVES YOU, MAN.

08:57.867 --> 08:59.633
- THAT'S HOW YOU'RE GONNA PLAY?
- YES, IT IS.

08:59.633 --> 09:01.167
- ALL RIGHT, THEN,
WE'RE GONNA PLAY.

09:01.167 --> 09:03.133
- COME ON!
COME ON!

09:03.133 --> 09:05.167
TRY AND GET ME,
YOU BIG LOAD!

09:06.200 --> 09:07.867
YOU CAN'T DO IT!

09:07.867 --> 09:09.667
YOU CAN'T DO IT, SUCKER!

09:09.667 --> 09:10.767
- YOU ARE SO LUCKY.

09:10.767 --> 09:12.267
- RAY, DID YOU FINISH
GOING THROUGH

09:12.267 --> 09:13.667
ALL THIS CURRICULUM STUFF?

09:13.667 --> 09:16.700
- YEAH. YEAH, I DID.

09:16.700 --> 09:19.200
- THOSE BOOKS HAVEN'T MOVED
SINCE YOU BROUGHT THEM HOME.

09:19.200 --> 09:20.800
- I'M GONNA GET 'EM, DEBRA,

09:20.800 --> 09:23.533
IT'S JUST RIGHT NOW
I'M ENTERTAINING A GUEST.

09:23.533 --> 09:25.233
A-HA!

09:25.233 --> 09:27.367
- THE REVIEW BOARD
IS TOMORROW MORNING.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.633
YOU HAVE WASTED
THE ENTIRE WEEKEND.

09:29.633 --> 09:31.100
- YOU'RE RIGHT, DEBRA,
I'M SORRY.

09:31.100 --> 09:32.400
- HEY, COME ON.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.733
- CUBBY, YOU CAN'T PLAY
VIDEO GAMES

09:33.733 --> 09:37.433
IF YOU HAVEN'T FINISHED
YOUR HOMEWORK.

09:37.433 --> 09:39.733
- I'M GONNA GET TO IT.
- WHEN?

09:39.733 --> 09:41.767
- YOU KNOW, RAYMOND, EVERY DAY
AT THE END OF MY SHIFT,

09:41.767 --> 09:45.067
I HAVE A MOUNTAIN OF PAPERWORK,
AND YOU KNOW WHEN I DO IT?

09:45.067 --> 09:50.133
- WHEN YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE OUT
BUYING NOSE HAIR CLIPPERS?

09:57.733 --> 10:00.133
- I DO IT RIGHT AWAY,

10:00.133 --> 10:01.767
BECAUSE THERE IS
NO WORSE FEELING

10:01.767 --> 10:04.500
THAN WHEN YOU'VE PUT SOMETHING
OFF TO THE LAST SECOND,

10:04.500 --> 10:06.833
AND IT'S GETTING DARK,

10:06.833 --> 10:08.300
AND THE CLOCK IS TICKING,

10:08.300 --> 10:13.767
AND YOU REALIZE
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA MAKE IT.

10:13.767 --> 10:15.033
- GO.
GET OUT OF HERE.

10:15.033 --> 10:16.800
- [clicking tongue]

10:16.800 --> 10:18.000
- GET OUT OF HERE!

10:18.000 --> 10:19.200
- ALL RIGHT.
VERY WELL.

10:19.200 --> 10:20.567
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:20.567 --> 10:22.167
- BUT JUST SO YOU
WON'T BE DISTRACTED,

10:22.167 --> 10:24.367
I'M GONNA TAKE
THIS LITTLE ITEM WITH ME.

10:24.367 --> 10:25.767
- IT'S NOT YOURS!

10:25.767 --> 10:28.100
- THIS WAY, YOU CAN GET
ALL YOUR WORK DONE.

10:28.100 --> 10:29.767
AND BY TOMORROW MORNING,

10:29.767 --> 10:32.167
I SHALL BE
THE GREATEST ZOMBIE HUNTER

10:32.167 --> 10:36.267
OF ALL TIME.

10:36.267 --> 10:39.200
THAT'S RIGHT.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.300
[mouthing words]

10:47.867 --> 10:49.700
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL GET STARTED.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.567
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I'M JUST GONNA TELL 'EM

10:51.567 --> 10:53.600
TO CUT EVERYTHING IN HALF '
CAUSE IT'S TOO MUCH.

10:53.600 --> 10:55.000
- YOU CAN'T JUST TELL 'EM
TO CUT THINGS.

10:55.000 --> 10:56.500
YOU HAVE
TO GIVE THEM REASONS.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.867
YOU HAVE TO FILL OUT
ALL THOSE EVALUATION FORMS.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.233
- NO WAY!

11:01.233 --> 11:02.700
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

11:02.700 --> 11:05.100
- LISTEN, I HAVE DONE
FOUR LOADS OF LAUNDRY,

11:05.100 --> 11:07.067
PAID ALL THE BILLS,
PUT THREE KIDS TO BED.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.600
I HAVE DONE MY JOB.
YOU DO YOURS.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.500
AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I'M GONNA GO TO SLEEP.

11:11.500 --> 11:12.667
GOOD NIGHT.

11:15.867 --> 11:19.067
- JUST SO YOU KNOW,
YOU COULD HAVE HAD SEX TONIGHT.

11:21.733 --> 11:24.267
IT WAS GONNA BE GOOD.
ALL NEW STUFF.

11:32.967 --> 11:34.467
[groans]

11:35.867 --> 11:37.967
WHAT THE HELL?

11:37.967 --> 11:39.467
[sighs]

11:42.233 --> 11:47.733
- SURE, I CAN HELP YOU
WITH THIS, RAYMOND.

11:47.733 --> 11:49.600
IT DOESN'T SEEM
ALL THAT DIFFICULT.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.267
- I KNOW.

11:51.267 --> 11:53.300
IT'S JUST I DIDN'T THINK THERE
WOULD BE SO MUCH, YOU KNOW?

11:53.300 --> 11:54.767
AND IT'S ALREADY 10:30,

11:54.767 --> 11:57.733
AND OF COURSE,
DEBRA NEVER WANTS TO HELP ME.

12:00.100 --> 12:01.833
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

12:01.833 --> 12:04.800
THAT'S WHAT MOTHERS ARE FOR.

12:04.800 --> 12:08.667
BUT MAYBE NEXT TIME YOU'LL BE
A LITTLE MORE RESPONSIBLE

12:08.667 --> 12:11.333
AND DO THINGS ON TIME

12:11.333 --> 12:14.433
SO I COULD BE PROUD OF YOU.

12:15.933 --> 12:17.367
- I'M SORRY.
- OKAY.

12:17.367 --> 12:19.500
- WHAT'S GOIN' ON IN THERE?

12:19.500 --> 12:21.700
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, FRANK?

12:21.700 --> 12:23.467
- OH.

12:23.467 --> 12:27.500
I THOUGHT YOU WERE EATING
THAT LAST PIECE OF PIE.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.233
- I'M HELPING RAYMOND
WITH HIS SCHOOL PROJECT.

12:30.233 --> 12:31.967
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.

12:31.967 --> 12:35.500
I'M GONNA EAT THAT PIE
SO I KNOW WHERE IT IS.

12:36.833 --> 12:38.900
- HEY, DAD,
LET ME GET A SLIVER OF THAT.

12:38.900 --> 12:41.133
- NICE TRY.

12:41.133 --> 12:43.067
- RAYMOND, PAY ATTENTION.

12:43.067 --> 12:45.233
WHY DON'T WE START
WITH LITERATURE

12:45.233 --> 12:47.967
AND READING COMPREHENSION
GUIDELINES, OKAY?

12:47.967 --> 12:51.367
"BASED ON THE READINGS
OF MARK TWAIN'S 'TOM SAWYER,'

12:51.367 --> 12:53.000
"WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND

12:53.000 --> 12:55.267
"FOR 5TH GRADE HOMEWORK,
AND WHY?

12:55.267 --> 12:58.000
"A) A BOOK REPORT,
INCLUDING COVER ART...

12:58.000 --> 12:59.533
- [grunts]
- "AND ILLUSTRATIONS;

12:59.533 --> 13:04.133
"B) AN ORAL REPORT USING
PERIOD MUSIC AND COSTUMES,

13:04.133 --> 13:06.567
"C) A CRAFT PROJECT BASED ON

13:06.567 --> 13:08.833
"THE PRE-INDUSTRIAL ERA
ON THE MISSISSIPPI,

13:08.833 --> 13:14.933
"OR D) A FICTIONAL DIARY
ON ONE OF THE CHARACTERS?"

13:14.933 --> 13:17.667
RAYMOND!

13:22.133 --> 13:24.200
- OW!

13:24.200 --> 13:26.000
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

13:26.000 --> 13:29.833
- I LIKE PIE.

13:29.833 --> 13:32.300
- RAYMOND, PAY ATTENTION.

13:32.300 --> 13:34.200
I'M GONNA READ YOU THIS AGAIN.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.533
- NO, NOT AGAIN, ALL RIGHT?
I HEARD IT ALREADY.

13:36.533 --> 13:38.933
- [chuckles]

13:38.933 --> 13:41.367
- HOW ABOUT WE DON'T MAKE
THE KIDS READ "TOM SAWYER"?

13:41.367 --> 13:45.100
- WHAT?
IT'S AN AMERICAN CLASSIC.

13:45.100 --> 13:48.100
- ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I SAY "A."

13:48.100 --> 13:49.567
- GOOD.
WHY?

13:52.467 --> 13:55.133
- "B."

13:55.133 --> 13:57.333
- RAYMOND, DON'T PLAY GAMES
WITH ME.

13:57.333 --> 13:59.367
WE NEED
TO DO THIS PROPERLY.

13:59.367 --> 14:01.367
NOW, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO EXPLAIN "TOM SAWYER,"

14:01.367 --> 14:02.900
WHICH OF THESE
WOULD YOU RECOMMEND

14:02.900 --> 14:06.367
TO THE SCHOOL BOARD,
AND WHY?

14:06.367 --> 14:09.933
- YOU NEVER READ "TOM SAWYER,"
DID YOU?

14:09.933 --> 14:11.267
- WELL, YES, I DID.

14:11.267 --> 14:13.433
- WHAT'S IT ABOUT?

14:13.433 --> 14:17.633
- A BOY NAMED TOM SAWYER.

14:17.633 --> 14:20.700
EAT YOUR PIE.

14:20.700 --> 14:22.267
- RAYMOND.

14:22.267 --> 14:24.533
YOU NEVER READ
"TOM SAWYER"?

14:24.533 --> 14:26.233
- WELL, ALL RIGHT, I DIDN'T.
SO WHAT?

14:26.233 --> 14:29.533
- YOU NEVER READ "TOM SAWYER"?

14:29.533 --> 14:35.100
- AND YOU NEVER READ "LEGENDARY
RUNNING BACKS OF THE NFL."

14:35.100 --> 14:37.033
- THAT'S SPORTS.

14:37.033 --> 14:38.533
- THAT'S RIGHT, MA,
A SPORTS BOOK.

14:38.533 --> 14:40.567
A SPORTS BOOK!

14:40.567 --> 14:43.167
THAT'S BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT I LIKED!

14:43.167 --> 14:45.267
ALL THIS STUFF
THEY MAKE YOU DO IN SCHOOL,

14:45.267 --> 14:47.367
THAT'S WHAT THEY THINK
IS IMPORTANT.

14:47.367 --> 14:49.467
I DID--I READ WHAT I WANTED TO,
AND LOOK AT ME.

14:49.467 --> 14:51.633
I AM SOMEONE WHO DID NOT
READ "TOM SAWYER,"

14:51.633 --> 14:55.533
AND YET I DID NOT TURN OUT
TO BE A HOBO.

14:55.533 --> 14:57.900
- WELL, I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED.

14:57.900 --> 14:59.900
- ME TOO!

14:59.900 --> 15:02.500
ANY COOKIES?

15:02.500 --> 15:05.000
- OBVIOUSLY YOU JUST DID
ENOUGH WORK TO GET BY,

15:05.000 --> 15:06.567
AND NOW YOU'RE PROUD OF IT.

15:06.567 --> 15:09.067
- WELL, YEAH!
I AM PROUD OF IT!

15:09.067 --> 15:10.267
ALL THOSE SPORTS BOOKS
I READ

15:10.267 --> 15:11.733
AND ALL THE SPORTS
I WATCHED ON TV,

15:11.733 --> 15:14.100
THAT'S HOW I GOT TO BE
WHERE I'M AT.

15:18.700 --> 15:24.567
- "THAT'S HOW I GOT TO BE
WHERE I'M AT"?

15:29.100 --> 15:31.000
- YEAH.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.333
THAT'S RIGHT.

15:32.333 --> 15:34.567
- YOU'RE A WRITER,

15:34.567 --> 15:38.133
AND THAT'S HOW YOU USE
THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE?

15:38.133 --> 15:39.800
- WHAT?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKIN' ABOUT?

15:39.800 --> 15:42.833
- YOU DO NOT END A SENTENCE
WITH "AT."

15:42.833 --> 15:44.367
- ALL RIGHT.
BIG DEAL.

15:44.367 --> 15:45.567
I ENDED IT
WITH A PROPOSITION.

15:45.567 --> 15:48.500
- PREPOSITION.
IT'S A PREP--

15:48.500 --> 15:50.933
OH, MY GOD!

15:50.933 --> 15:52.767
- WHAT? WHAT? WHAT ARE YOU
GETTING SO UPSET ABOUT?

15:52.767 --> 15:57.400
- BECAUSE THIS IS
THE END OF CIVILIZATION!

15:57.400 --> 16:00.100
PEOPLE LIKE YOU DON'T WANT
TO WORK OR LEARN ANYTHING,

16:00.100 --> 16:03.467
BECAUSE THEY'RE TOO BUSY WITH
THEIR REMOTE CONTROL TELEVISION

16:03.467 --> 16:06.700
OR PLAYING WITH
THEIR HULA-HOOPS!

16:06.700 --> 16:11.967
AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
THAT'S WHERE WE'RE AT!

16:11.967 --> 16:14.367
- WHERE ARE THE COOKIES AT?

16:18.133 --> 16:19.800
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
FORGET ABOUT IT.

16:19.800 --> 16:21.600
MA, I'LL DO IT.
RELAX, OKAY? GIVE IT TO ME.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.233
- NO, NO, NO,
I'M NOT GIVING YOU THIS.

16:23.233 --> 16:24.733
THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT
TO GIVE TO SOMEONE

16:24.733 --> 16:28.600
WITH YOUR KIND OF ATTITUDE
ABOUT EDUCATION.

17:05.600 --> 17:07.333
- SO YOU GOT WHAT
I WAS SAYIN' THERE--GOOD.

17:07.333 --> 17:10.167
- OH, KNOCK IT OFF, RAY.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.033
YOU GOT YOUR MOMMY DOING
YOUR HOMEWORK FOR YOU?

17:16.033 --> 17:17.633
- I HAVE TO, DEBRA.

17:17.633 --> 17:21.333
IT TURNS OUT
I RAISED AN ILLITERATE.

17:23.033 --> 17:25.500
- CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING, RAY?

17:25.500 --> 17:28.967
WHAT WILL IT TAKE FOR YOU TO
GET INVOLVED IN SOMETHING, HM?

17:28.967 --> 17:31.200
I MEAN, THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH
DIDN'T DO IT FOR YOU.

17:31.200 --> 17:32.967
THE CHURCH CARNIVAL WASN'T
FOR YOU.

17:32.967 --> 17:39.767
YOU SAID, "THE LORD DOESN'T NEED
ME TO SIT IN A DUNKING BOOTH."

17:39.767 --> 17:42.233
AND NOW EVEN YOUR CHILDREN'S
EDUCATION ISN'T ENOUGH.

17:42.233 --> 17:44.167
SO I WAS JUST WONDERING,

17:44.167 --> 17:45.867
WHEN WILL SOMETHING
BE IMPORTANT ENOUGH

17:45.867 --> 17:48.767
FOR YOU TO TAKE A STAND?

17:53.100 --> 17:54.600
- OW!

18:03.767 --> 18:05.867
- I ALSO THINK WE SHOULD
INTRODUCE HISTORIOGRAPHY

18:05.867 --> 18:07.533
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

18:07.533 --> 18:11.000
IT WOULD BE HIGHLY BENEFICIAL
TO ALL THE 5TH AND 6TH GRADERS.

18:11.000 --> 18:13.200
THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU, MISS SILVER.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.000
NOW, I BELIEVE WE'RE UP
TO ONE OF OUR PARENTS,

18:15.000 --> 18:16.867
MR. RAYMOND BARONE.

18:16.867 --> 18:19.533
MR. BARONE?

18:19.533 --> 18:21.533
- [clears throat]
HI.

18:21.533 --> 18:22.733
[chuckles]

18:22.733 --> 18:24.000
THANK YOU.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.767
ALL RIGHT.
WOW.

18:26.767 --> 18:29.667
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT
GOIN' OVER THE MATERIAL,

18:29.667 --> 18:31.733
AND...

18:31.733 --> 18:33.067
WELL...

18:33.067 --> 18:37.467
I JUST GOT
A FEW THINGS TO SAY.

18:37.467 --> 18:39.167
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS A KID,

18:39.167 --> 18:42.400
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WE HAD
TOO MUCH HOMEWORK.

18:42.400 --> 18:46.167
AND SINCE I HATED
ALL THE HOMEWORK,

18:46.167 --> 18:49.567
I STARTED
TO HATE LEARNING.

18:49.567 --> 18:52.667
IN FACT, WHAT I LEARNED
TO DO MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE

18:52.667 --> 18:54.533
WAS TO AVOID THE WORK.

18:54.533 --> 18:59.667
I'M SORRY TO SAY I STILL TRY
TO AVOID IT WHENEVER I CAN.

18:59.667 --> 19:01.033
JUST ASK MY WIFE.

19:01.033 --> 19:02.633
[chuckles]

19:07.733 --> 19:12.933
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT SEEMS TO ME
LIKE THE KIDS TODAY,

19:12.933 --> 19:17.833
THEY'VE GOT TEN TIMES
THE HOMEWORK THAT WE HAD.

19:17.833 --> 19:23.033
YOU KNOW, AND I DON'T WANT
MY DAUGHTER TO HATE LEARNING.

19:23.033 --> 19:25.133
I WANT HER TO BE CURIOUS
AND THOUGHTFUL

19:25.133 --> 19:28.033
AND GET EXCITED
ABOUT NEW IDEAS.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.533
AND MOST OF ALL--

19:29.533 --> 19:32.800
AND I THINK THIS IS WHAT
WE WANT FOR ALL OUR KIDS--

19:32.800 --> 19:35.500
I WANT HER TO BE HAPPY.

19:35.500 --> 19:37.033
I MEAN, I THINK
THERE'S HOMEWORK

19:37.033 --> 19:38.633
THAT'S IMPORTANT
AND EVERYTHING,

19:38.633 --> 19:42.400
AND THEN I THINK
THERE'S OVERLOAD.

19:42.400 --> 19:44.400
I MEAN,
ARE WE PILING IT ON?

19:44.400 --> 19:45.767
YOU KNOW, WE'RE SO WORRIED

19:45.767 --> 19:47.733
ABOUT THE KIDS
WON'T BE COMPETITIVE

19:47.733 --> 19:49.267
AND OUR KIDS
WON'T HAVE A FUTURE

19:49.267 --> 19:55.200
THAT WE'RE TAKING AWAY
THEIR PRESENT.

19:59.133 --> 20:00.700
ANYWAY, SO,
YOU KNOW,

20:00.700 --> 20:03.767
MAYBE WE CAN JUST KEEP
THAT IN MIND,

20:03.767 --> 20:05.300
'CAUSE ISN'T THAT
THE KIND OF SCHOOL

20:05.300 --> 20:10.467
THAT WE WANT OUR CHILDREN
TO BE AT?

20:10.467 --> 20:12.233
I MEAN IN.

20:12.233 --> 20:14.367
I MEAN OF.
I MEAN A PART OF.

20:14.367 --> 20:16.067
I MEAN, ISN'T THAT--

20:16.067 --> 20:18.800
ISN'T THAT THE KIND OF SCHOOL
THAT WE WANT OUR CHILDREN

20:18.800 --> 20:23.367
TO BE A PART OF?

20:23.367 --> 20:24.667
IN.

20:34.400 --> 20:38.733
- AND YOU WANTED TO CUT DOWN
ON THE ENGLISH HOMEWORK.

20:44.067 --> 20:45.800
- HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOIN'?

20:45.800 --> 20:49.100
- GRANDMA'S HELPING ME
WITH MY HOMEWORK.

20:49.100 --> 20:50.900
- OH.
WANT ME TO HELP?

20:50.900 --> 20:52.200
- THAT'S ALL RIGHT, DEAR.

20:52.200 --> 20:53.733
WE'RE WORKING ON GRAMMAR
RIGHT NOW.

20:57.267 --> 20:59.167
- ALL RIGHT, THEN,

20:59.167 --> 21:00.400
I'LL BE SURE
AND KEEP THE TV DOWN.

21:00.400 --> 21:02.333
- WAIT A MINUTE, RAYMOND.

21:02.333 --> 21:06.167
YOU HAVE SOME WORK TOO.

21:06.167 --> 21:09.033
- "TOM SAWYER."

21:09.033 --> 21:10.500
- YOU NEED TO READ THAT.

21:10.500 --> 21:12.733
-NO, MOM,
I TOLD YOU, I DON'T.

21:12.733 --> 21:14.167
- YES, YOU DO.

21:14.167 --> 21:17.667
I READ "LEGENDARY
RUNNING BACKS OF THE NFL."

21:20.867 --> 21:22.633
- YEAH, RIGHT.

21:22.633 --> 21:24.300
- POOR GALE SAYERS.

21:24.300 --> 21:26.900
FIRST TO LOSE A FRIEND
LIKE BRIAN PICCOLO,

21:26.900 --> 21:28.433
AND THEN TO HAVE
A CAREER CUT SHORT

21:28.433 --> 21:31.733
BECAUSE OF
ALL HIS KNEE INJURIES.

21:31.733 --> 21:33.633
GO.

21:33.633 --> 21:35.133
READ.

21:39.133 --> 21:42.233
- YOU PROBABLY JUST READ
THE ONE CHAPTER.

21:42.233 --> 21:44.967
- JIM BROWN AVERAGED
5.2 YARDS PER CARRY

21:44.967 --> 21:47.133
FOR HIS ENTIRE CAREER.

21:52.167 --> 21:54.033
- DAMN YOU.
