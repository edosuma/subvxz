THE UNITED STATES OF LELAND

00:58.315 --> 01:01.359
<i>When I say I don't remember that day,
I'm not lying.</i>

01:05.536 --> 01:07.924
<i>I wish I did,
but I just don't.</i>

01:08.683 --> 01:10.915
<i>Sometimes the most
important stuff goes away.</i>

01:12.429 --> 01:15.939
<i>It goes away so bad,
it's like it was never there to begin with.</i>

01:18.573 --> 01:21.188
<i>It's funny,
the stuff that sticks in your head.</i>

01:21.649 --> 01:24.700
<i>I could tell you forward and backward
about some day when I was five,</i>

01:25.127 --> 01:27.447
<i>and my dad bought me
a stupid ice-cream cone.</i>

01:27.930 --> 01:30.155
<i>I could tell you the
flavour of the ice cream...</i>

01:30.528 --> 01:33.230
<i>Was... pink bubble gum.</i>

01:33.673 --> 01:36.359
<i>...and even stuff about
the girl who scooped it out.</i>

01:36.689 --> 01:38.771
<i>Her hair was fire red.</i>

01:40.269 --> 01:43.707
<i>All that stuff is there like
it was happening right now, but...</i>

01:44.100 --> 01:46.106
<i>I don't remember that day.</i>

01:46.489 --> 01:48.902
<i>At least, not the stuff
that they want me to.</i>

01:51.378 --> 01:54.508
<i>I remember it was the
first really hot day of spring.</i>

01:55.518 --> 01:58.977
<i>I remember how the sun felt
on the back of my neck.</i>

02:00.098 --> 02:02.021
<i>That's about it.</i>

02:02.615 --> 02:05.098
<i>Here's another one
of those things that sticks.</i>

02:05.587 --> 02:08.461
<i>This one is something
a friend of mine said to me.</i>

02:08.952 --> 02:12.853
<i>"You have to believe that life is more
than the sum of its parts, kiddo. "</i>

02:13.302 --> 02:16.212
<i>I remember it right
down to that "kiddo" part.</i>

02:16.879 --> 02:21.059
<i>But when I think about what she said,
the same thing always comes into my head...</i>

02:23.534 --> 02:27.004
<i>What if you can't put the pieces
together in the first place?</i>

02:43.035 --> 02:46.608
# And this I know,
his teeth as white as snow

02:47.114 --> 02:50.545
# What a gas it was to see him

02:51.038 --> 02:54.664
# Walk her every day,
into a shady place

02:55.729 --> 02:57.830
# With lips, she said...

02:59.688 --> 03:00.820
Erm...

03:01.701 --> 03:03.481
Just hold on one sec.

03:04.087 --> 03:09.575
# Hey, Paul, hey, Paul, hey, Paul
Let's have a ball...

03:10.032 --> 03:11.596
Come in.

03:15.143 --> 03:17.067
- How are you, Beck?
- Good.

03:17.499 --> 03:20.519
Yeah, you know, I'm pretty good.
I'm good.

03:20.769 --> 03:22.724
Daddy, how are you?

03:23.004 --> 03:24.843
<i>Where's Ryan?</i>

03:56.463 --> 03:59.667
I was telling her the same thing
five minutes ago, Mrs Pollard.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.448
I swear, it's like she doesn't
wanna listen to us.

04:02.769 --> 04:05.393
I just don't think I sounded
as good as the other girls.

04:05.831 --> 04:08.573
I think it's a good experience for you.
You've never done one of the musicals.

04:08.938 --> 04:10.875
Yeah, well,
this is the first and the last.

04:11.219 --> 04:12.361
I love your voice.

04:12.773 --> 04:16.784
You'd say that if I sounded like
a harpy with throat cancer.

04:17.204 --> 04:19.637
- You think it's bad?
- No.

04:20.357 --> 04:21.690
Of course not.

04:45.178 --> 04:47.660
# Stuck here out of gas

04:48.890 --> 04:51.621
# Out here on the Gaza Strip...

04:55.614 --> 04:57.044
Damn.

05:09.809 --> 05:14.318
<i>Julie Pollard, Tim Wallace from the Drama
Department at Iowa. Just checking up on you.</i>

05:14.678 --> 05:16.915
<i>Wondered if we can expect
to see you in the fall.</i>

05:16.950 --> 05:19.238
<i>Give me a call here at the office.
I'll be in tomorrow.</i>

05:19.713 --> 05:22.086
You should call him,
let him know you settled on ASU.

05:22.463 --> 05:25.259
- You did send your confirmation?
- I think I still have a few days.

05:25.647 --> 05:27.911
Oh, Mom, the shop called.
They say you can pick up your car.

05:28.246 --> 05:29.931
What's the damage?

05:30.321 --> 05:32.831
<i>- They didn't say on the machine.
- Oh, that's a great sign!</i>

05:34.183 --> 05:35.556
Hello?

05:36.674 --> 05:38.921
Slow down, Harry,
I can't understand you.

05:39.917 --> 05:41.076
<i>What?</i>

05:42.239 --> 05:43.947
<i>What happened?</i>

05:45.990 --> 05:48.108
No, I'll... I'll be right there.

05:54.911 --> 05:56.588
Lee?

06:07.178 --> 06:08.707
<i>Lee?</i>

06:12.037 --> 06:13.716
Hi, Mommy.

06:14.447 --> 06:16.301
<i>Are you all right?</i>

06:24.616 --> 06:25.912
Er...

06:26.799 --> 06:29.088
I think I made a mistake.

06:34.606 --> 06:37.066
<i>I can't imagine too many details
have been released...</i>

06:39.818 --> 06:42.593
<i>...suspect's here.
Do they have any leads?</i>

06:43.028 --> 06:44.958
<i>- Yeah?
- Are you watching the news, chief?</i>

06:45.386 --> 06:47.513
Er, yeah, you know I gotta stay
on top of the topical shit.

06:48.017 --> 06:50.349
<i>The TV boys say the
suspect is 16.</i>

06:50.962 --> 06:54.533
<i>Ten bucks says the SFK winds
up here in your class tomorrow.</i>

06:55.145 --> 06:58.424
<i>- Why would he be Special Handling? - You
can get by with a lot of shit in this world</i>

06:58.788 --> 07:01.929
<i>but you can't stab a retarded
kid and not be Special Handling.</i>

07:02.235 --> 07:03.376
<i>S.F.K. chief.</i>

07:04.153 --> 07:05.682
Sick Fucking Kid.

07:17.769 --> 07:21.494
# Another one we
all walk away

07:23.242 --> 07:27.337
# Never a dream your eyes,
wont you play

07:28.837 --> 07:33.164
# Rhythm alone won't
hold me in mind

07:45.575 --> 07:49.750
# Ooh want to set it all on fire

07:50.979 --> 07:55.619
# Bury my feet in the
cold of a meadow

07:56.566 --> 08:01.617
# Into the unknown
northern wind

08:02.143 --> 08:07.668
# Dreams to ignite through
northern fields we'll fly

08:07.996 --> 08:12.986
# Fly

08:13.305 --> 08:18.127
# Don't tell me its all the
same in the middle

08:18.655 --> 08:23.782
# So memory lie
outside your meadow

08:24.312 --> 08:29.255
# Tow me around
outside the middle

08:29.966 --> 08:35.083
# Turn me around
all I can be here

09:05.020 --> 09:07.882
<i>Sorry, ma'am, visiting days are
every second Sunday of the month.</i>

09:08.248 --> 09:10.865
- Noon to four.
- He didn't do this, ok?

09:11.687 --> 09:13.267
He didn't do this...

09:13.966 --> 09:16.409
horrible things they say he did.

09:16.814 --> 09:19.993
- There's nothing I can do, all right?
- Please, please. One minute.

09:19.994 --> 09:20.994
One minute.

09:21.480 --> 09:24.349
Right, there's nothing I can do,
so I need you to turn around.

09:24.752 --> 09:28.662
<i>...apprehended the alleged suspect
at an area hospital earlier this evening.</i>

09:31.000 --> 09:33.066
<i>Leland! Leland Fitzgerald!</i>

09:33.468 --> 09:34.833
<i>Did you do it?</i>

09:35.109 --> 09:36.827
Do you have anything to say?

09:45.744 --> 09:47.569
<i>We'll be right back.</i>

09:48.313 --> 09:51.721
<i>The Jiffy Lube signature service oil change,
every 3000 month.</i>

10:08.439 --> 10:10.168
- Briefcase?
- Briefcase.

10:23.297 --> 10:25.184
Hi. Good morning.

10:25.588 --> 10:28.142
- I was wondering if I could borrow
a stamp? - Let me see.

10:28.843 --> 10:30.209
Erm...

10:30.839 --> 10:34.840
I'm kinda new here, so I'm not
really sure where they keep stuff.

10:35.167 --> 10:36.416
I blanked on a phone bill.

10:36.742 --> 10:38.770
I'm gonna be in debtor's prison
if I don't get it in the mail.

10:39.123 --> 10:41.311
<i>Get the bills.
I understand.</i>

10:43.151 --> 10:44.643
Here we are.

10:45.230 --> 10:46.515
Thanks.

10:47.236 --> 10:49.580
Oh, by the way, I'm Pearl.

10:52.443 --> 10:53.866
- Good morning.
- Hey.

10:54.207 --> 10:55.633
What did I tell you, chief?

10:55.901 --> 11:00.902
Newest addition to SH and your very own
pop sheet, Mr Leland P. Fitzgerald,

11:01.339 --> 11:04.210
- killer of retarded kids.
- Kid.

11:04.792 --> 11:06.615
Ben, retarded kid, singular.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.912
You'll never guess
who his daddy is.

11:09.306 --> 11:10.738
I'll put 50 bucks on Satan.

11:12.012 --> 11:13.544
Albert Fitzgerald.

11:14.023 --> 11:17.013
- No shit?
- Hey, I was close.

11:17.547 --> 11:19.486
- What's wrong with Fitzgerald?
- Let me see...

11:19.798 --> 11:21.593
He's a drunk, a misogynist...

11:21.937 --> 11:23.809
- Cat can write.
- He's despicable.

11:24.313 --> 11:27.767
Despicable? He's a bastard. So what?
You don't judge a writer by his life.

11:28.105 --> 11:31.206
You judge him by his work.
A different moral standard going on here.

11:53.269 --> 11:54.801
Excuse me, ma'am.

11:56.644 --> 11:58.379
Could I look at your paper?

11:58.732 --> 12:00.460
Oh, yes, certainly, erm...

12:00.839 --> 12:02.359
Business or Life?

12:02.757 --> 12:05.251
Oh, no, I'll wait for the
front page, thank you.

12:10.117 --> 12:11.547
Excuse me.

12:11.972 --> 12:14.041
<i>I'm sorry if I'm
bothering you, but...</i>

12:14.394 --> 12:17.084
<i>- aren't you an actor?
- Aren't we all, dear?</i>

12:17.371 --> 12:19.774
No, no.
I mean, a famous actor.

12:20.266 --> 12:21.934
<i>I know your face.</i>

12:22.347 --> 12:25.762
I was in Stanley Kubrick's musical,
the one about the alcoholic pirates.

12:26.157 --> 12:27.953
I played Captain Morgan.

12:29.521 --> 12:31.743
<i>Whenever you're done
with the front page, dear.</i>

12:35.078 --> 12:37.729
How about hooking us up with a
table right by the kitchen, dog?

12:49.501 --> 12:51.178
What you in for, dog?

12:53.927 --> 12:56.894
Hey, I'm not asking you cos I'm gonna kick
your ass if you did some fucked-up shit,

12:57.243 --> 12:59.402
cos I already know you
did some fucked-up shit.

13:01.271 --> 13:03.627
Hey, a guy like me,

13:04.083 --> 13:06.896
you know he's an SH cos he ratted
out some bitch from State Street.

13:07.258 --> 13:09.624
Now half the pop wants to stick
a fucking pencil to his eye.

13:10.660 --> 13:13.337
Hey, but white boys ain't about
that gang shit though, huh?

13:13.675 --> 13:16.658
Especially not white boys like you
who don't look like no Slim Shady.

13:17.544 --> 13:20.841
White boys like you the ones
who did some fucked-up shit, huh?

13:24.012 --> 13:25.333
That's cool, dog.

13:32.883 --> 13:36.305
OK, everybody,
take your seats, please.

13:37.999 --> 13:40.887
You'll have to forgive Mr Madison today.
He's moving kinda slow.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.400
His head's beating like it's
the end of the world.

13:43.770 --> 13:45.928
You been drinking that cheap
ass burgundy again, ain't you?

13:46.316 --> 13:48.633
<i>Hey, three bucks, two litres.
I couldn't pass it up.</i>

13:50.091 --> 13:52.386
You, sir, are new to my class.

13:52.809 --> 13:55.908
- What's your name?
- Fitzgerald. Leland P. Fitzgerald.

13:56.379 --> 13:59.372
Well, Mr Leland P. Fitzgerald,
my name is Pearl Madison.

13:59.717 --> 14:03.319
And I'm gonna be your history teacher,
your science teacher, your math teacher,

14:03.649 --> 14:05.569
your anything else
teacher all rolled into one

14:05.939 --> 14:08.616
for however many days, weeks,
months you'll be here with us.

14:12.168 --> 14:13.185
<i>Hey, Pearly,</i>

14:13.579 --> 14:15.804
<i>when are you bringing
your dancer up here, dog?</i>

14:16.152 --> 14:18.322
As soon as the lovely
Miranda returns from LA,

14:18.597 --> 14:21.824
- I'm sure she would be delighted
to meet you hoodlums. - Liar.

14:30.753 --> 14:32.312
Hey, Mrs Pollard.

14:36.724 --> 14:40.157
- Have you been up all night?
- Yes, I suppose I have.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.550
Need a light there?

14:49.376 --> 14:52.475
I... don't feel so bad.

14:52.757 --> 14:54.442
I thought you quit, too.

15:00.683 --> 15:02.986
How could he have been
that much to someone?

15:04.153 --> 15:07.273
How could he mean enough
for that boy to hurt him?

15:07.554 --> 15:09.214
He was barely there.

15:14.275 --> 15:16.754
Mrs Pollard, I really
don't know what to say.

15:17.226 --> 15:18.480
Um...

15:20.230 --> 15:22.113
But I just want you to know...

15:22.519 --> 15:25.517
that if there's anything
that I can do, just tell me.

15:26.077 --> 15:27.566
It's all right, sweetheart.

15:39.099 --> 15:42.346
<i>And as you look out over Venice today,
you see the city...</i>

15:42.746 --> 15:45.356
<i>- Hey. - Hey, in Venice,
there's no streets, right?</i>

15:45.383 --> 15:46.990
<i>There's just rivers and shit?</i>

15:47.562 --> 15:49.316
Er, canals and shit, yeah.

15:49.729 --> 15:51.595
They don't even allow
cars on the island.

15:52.041 --> 15:54.336
<i>- You can hear footsteps.
- What's that?</i>

15:54.726 --> 15:56.602
Since they don't allow cars,
when you're walking around,

15:56.991 --> 15:58.707
all you can hear is footsteps.

16:00.218 --> 16:02.474
Hey, Pearly,
help me out here, bro.

16:02.912 --> 16:06.976
I'm developing this theory, right,
that the suicide rate of Venice is real low.

16:07.299 --> 16:08.694
Cos if you jump off a building,

16:09.111 --> 16:11.744
all your ass is gonna do is splash
in a canal and shit, right?

16:12.443 --> 16:14.888
OK, well, why don't we expand
on that theory tomorrow?

16:15.610 --> 16:18.586
Class dismissed, you guys. Go ahead
and bring your books up to the front.

16:29.436 --> 16:31.167
<i>Hey, where were you, B?</i>

16:33.713 --> 16:35.296
I was kinda wondering...

16:35.637 --> 16:38.419
Maybe I could keep this
and do some writing in my room?

16:38.689 --> 16:41.182
Unfortunately, I can't allow you
to take anything out of a class.

16:41.545 --> 16:43.511
But I'll keep it up
here safe for you.

16:46.962 --> 16:49.459
Hey, um... I'm jealous.

16:49.999 --> 16:53.483
- When did you go to Italy?
- My dad lives in Paris.

16:53.886 --> 16:56.159
<i>So sometimes,
we travel together.</i>

16:58.438 --> 17:00.118
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

17:21.137 --> 17:24.155
You're the one that killed
that retarded kid, huh?

17:27.583 --> 17:30.059
Was it some kind of
devil worship thing?

17:32.860 --> 17:34.805
What did you do to your hand?

17:38.194 --> 17:40.207
I stabbed myself.

17:42.094 --> 17:45.494
If you're going for suicide,
I'd say try the stomach or somethin'.

17:48.707 --> 17:51.081
I just wanted to know
what it felt like.

17:55.211 --> 17:56.938
I bet it hurt.

17:57.737 --> 18:01.130
Should've just asked me, devil boy,
I would have saved you some trouble.

18:36.721 --> 18:40.578
The journal goes down the front of your
pants, the pencil goes in your sock.

18:41.959 --> 18:43.139
Thanks.

18:43.581 --> 18:45.722
I'm just glad to see
somebody's writing.

18:49.383 --> 18:52.578
Er, Pearl?
Can I ask you a question?

18:57.241 --> 18:58.794
It's about your name.

18:59.316 --> 19:01.881
You're wondering, why Pearl?

19:02.293 --> 19:04.895
- You like basketball?
- Sure.

19:05.520 --> 19:08.291
Well, in the '70s, there was this guy
who played for the Knicks.

19:08.678 --> 19:10.819
His name was Earl Monroe.
His nickname was The Pearl.

19:11.278 --> 19:13.370
- Earl the Pearl?
- Earl the Pearl, right.

19:13.829 --> 19:15.663
Well, my parents
were in Queens then.

19:16.013 --> 19:17.952
My mom was a dancer.
She hated sports.

19:18.413 --> 19:21.331
But somehow my dad talked her into going
to check out a game at the Garden.

19:21.741 --> 19:23.736
It just turns out that it's
Earl the Pearl's night.

19:24.100 --> 19:26.447
Cat went off,
dropped 33 points on the Celtics.

19:27.054 --> 19:29.912
After the game, all my mom could do
was talk about how watching him play

19:30.354 --> 19:33.557
was like watching a dance recital,
because he moved like poetry...

19:33.949 --> 19:36.421
- Hey! Hey! Break it up!
- Outta my way, man!

19:40.447 --> 19:42.375
Anyway, when I was a kid,

19:42.860 --> 19:44.641
that was pretty much
all the story I got.

19:45.146 --> 19:47.786
But a couple of Christmases ago,
I'm knocking a few back with my dad.

19:48.093 --> 19:49.465
And he embellishes.

19:49.928 --> 19:51.819
So, after the game,
they went back to Queens.

19:52.607 --> 19:55.764
Well, thankfully,
my dad spared me the details here.

19:56.176 --> 19:58.156
But um... the condom broke.

19:58.631 --> 20:00.386
And nine months later, whoops.

20:00.780 --> 20:02.639
- Here comes Pearl.
- Here comes Pearl.

20:04.236 --> 20:06.039
Trust me, the sock.

20:13.683 --> 20:15.614
<i>I know what they
want from me.</i>

20:16.016 --> 20:20.484
<i>They want a reason, something to tie up
with a little Bow and bury in the back yard.</i>

20:21.658 --> 20:24.511
<i>Bury it down so deep,
it's like it never happened.</i>

20:25.833 --> 20:28.202
<i>They want me to
say how I'm so sorry</i>

20:28.584 --> 20:30.366
<i>and it was my mom's fault,</i>

20:30.750 --> 20:32.953
<i>or maybe it was
my dad's fault,</i>

20:32.997 --> 20:35.813
<i>or it happened because
of TV or movies or...</i>

20:36.365 --> 20:37.633
<i>some junk like that.</i>

20:38.469 --> 20:40.702
<i>Or maybe I blame some girl.</i>

20:41.614 --> 20:43.703
<i>Not even when you
were a little kid?</i>

20:44.066 --> 20:47.214
You never thought about
whether there was angels or not?

20:48.168 --> 20:49.999
Maybe when I was a little kid.

20:51.705 --> 20:54.096
My grandmother died
when I was real little.

20:54.366 --> 20:56.455
And after that, every time...

20:56.608 --> 20:59.998
I stole candy or fought
with my mom or...

21:02.362 --> 21:04.843
...played with myself
or something,

21:05.537 --> 21:07.341
I'd get this real bad feeling.

21:07.725 --> 21:11.421
I'd picture her from up high with this big
frown on her face, looking down on me.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.654
I don't think that
they frown on us.

21:16.195 --> 21:17.480
I think that...

21:17.911 --> 21:19.540
they look after us.

21:19.673 --> 21:21.848
You know, like guardian angels.

21:23.414 --> 21:25.453
They take care of us,
make sure...

21:26.542 --> 21:29.657
...make sure nothing bad happens,
make sure everything's OK.

21:33.813 --> 21:37.046
Well, how come everything's not OK
most of the time?

21:40.213 --> 21:42.240
Well, maybe they're lazy.

21:44.423 --> 21:45.698
What?

21:46.170 --> 21:48.818
No, it's just kind of funny,
lazy angels.

21:50.809 --> 21:56.169
It makes me think of these big, fat guys
with wings, drinking beer and playing darts.

22:04.832 --> 22:07.408
I want you to be my
guardian angel, Lee.

22:08.984 --> 22:11.161
I want you to float over me,

22:11.440 --> 22:13.283
make sure that...

22:14.271 --> 22:16.454
...everything's gonna be OK.

22:18.172 --> 22:19.808
Your hair smells like...

22:20.826 --> 22:22.571
strawberries.

22:23.511 --> 22:26.237
It's my shampoo,
dodo, it's not my hair.

22:27.539 --> 22:29.617
- Well, I still like it.
- Look at me.

22:30.047 --> 22:31.912
I'm serious, OK?

22:32.971 --> 22:35.459
I want you to say that
you're always gonna be there.

22:36.399 --> 22:38.841
Sometimes I'm somewhere else.

22:41.142 --> 22:43.437
Just tell me that everything's...

22:43.867 --> 22:45.562
gonna be OK.

22:47.336 --> 22:50.100
Well, I can't really make
sure everything's OK.

22:52.540 --> 22:54.244
I know, but...

22:55.264 --> 22:57.312
Sometimes you say
things that aren't...

22:57.841 --> 22:58.958
totally true.

22:59.324 --> 23:00.976
But you say them
anyways because...

23:01.707 --> 23:05.518
...you want it to be true, you know,
maybe... maybe that's good enough.

23:08.097 --> 23:09.527
Just...

23:10.703 --> 23:13.566
Just tell me everything's
gonna be OK.

23:14.585 --> 23:17.711
Why don't you whisper
it in my ear, soft?

23:26.127 --> 23:28.098
Everything's gonna be OK.

24:04.493 --> 24:05.709
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

24:06.974 --> 24:09.295
if they extend the run,
you gotta stay, right?

24:11.038 --> 24:13.263
Course you gotta stay.
I recognise that.

24:13.645 --> 24:15.534
I'm not thrilled about it,
but you know...

24:15.923 --> 24:17.420
I recognise it.

24:19.595 --> 24:21.144
It's water, Miranda.

24:22.126 --> 24:23.957
No, it is, it's water.

24:24.427 --> 24:25.995
Listen.

24:27.965 --> 24:29.816
Ah! Sweet H20.

24:31.376 --> 24:32.630
Yeah.

24:33.532 --> 24:35.873
No, it's fine.
The writing's going fine.

24:38.165 --> 24:39.889
The truth? OK.

24:40.393 --> 24:41.864
Um...

24:42.241 --> 24:43.672
The truth is,

24:44.012 --> 24:45.757
whenever I sit down to write,

24:46.151 --> 24:48.399
I think I'm coming out of the gate
with something fresh and just...

24:48.803 --> 24:50.761
it winds up being a different
spin on Boneyard.

24:51.804 --> 24:55.030
Yeah, I've basically been rewriting
the same story for three years

24:55.544 --> 24:57.946
and I still can't get the
damn thing published.

24:59.905 --> 25:01.452
Thanks, honey.

25:02.040 --> 25:06.117
No, I appreciate it, but you're not really a
writer unless people are reading your shit.

25:09.978 --> 25:11.624
So, Miranda, look... um.

25:12.640 --> 25:14.599
I'm excited for you, really.

25:14.987 --> 25:16.190
I am.

25:16.963 --> 25:20.023
I'm fired up about all this.
I love that it's going so well for you.

25:20.537 --> 25:23.077
This might be that big break
you've been looking for.

25:23.435 --> 25:27.023
When that comes along, you've gotta
tear into that shit like a rabid dog.

25:27.366 --> 25:29.111
I recognise that.

25:32.246 --> 25:34.804
It'd just be a lot easier
if you were here.

25:35.610 --> 25:37.374
<i>...Fitzgerald's arrest.</i>

25:37.766 --> 25:40.843
<i>Right now, any connection between
the two teens is unclear.</i>

25:40.910 --> 25:43.362
<i>We'll have more
news right after this.</i>

25:45.515 --> 25:47.916
<i>Nobody enjoys shopping
for auto insurance.</i>

25:48.303 --> 25:50.353
<i>but try and do it when you've
had three speeding tickets.</i>

25:50.749 --> 25:52.187
<i>Or an accident.</i>

26:04.943 --> 26:08.440
I recall when our lives
were unusual and electric,

26:09.811 --> 26:12.841
when we burned with
something close to fire.

26:14.074 --> 26:16.358
But now, we sway
to a different rhythm.

26:17.494 --> 26:21.658
Lives lived without meaning
or even directed hope.

26:22.875 --> 26:25.649
The passage of time
measured only by loss.

26:26.656 --> 26:28.518
Loss of a job,

26:28.687 --> 26:30.411
loss of a minivan...

26:32.057 --> 26:33.682
...a son.

26:46.491 --> 26:47.676
Hi, Beth.

27:47.382 --> 27:48.745
<i>Are you OK?</i>

27:49.820 --> 27:51.200
What?

27:52.119 --> 27:53.848
Sorry, what did you say?

27:54.153 --> 27:55.889
I asked if you were OK.

27:57.341 --> 28:00.792
Yeah. Am I...
Am I OK about that guy, right?

28:10.509 --> 28:13.025
Kinda seemed like he
was bothering you.

28:13.887 --> 28:16.806
That's OK. Er...
it happens all the time.

28:17.210 --> 28:19.211
I think it's the uniform.

28:19.688 --> 28:22.696
<i>I have to wear it
at this school that I go to.</i>

28:23.109 --> 28:24.628
And it's supposed
to be really plain.

28:24.980 --> 28:27.097
The whole point of wearing
it is so you don't stand out.

28:27.975 --> 28:30.681
<i>I think all it really does
is turn on horny old guys.</i>

28:34.781 --> 28:36.322
Is it a Catholic school?

28:39.024 --> 28:40.985
No, it's pretty much the opposite.

28:41.618 --> 28:43.557
For people who messed up.

28:43.952 --> 28:45.794
Messed up in what way?

28:48.076 --> 28:50.398
All kinds of ways, different ways.

28:51.368 --> 28:53.476
Well, what way
did you mess up?

28:53.478 --> 28:56.535
Did you really come over here to
ask me about my screwed-up life?

28:59.173 --> 29:01.133
No, I came over here cos...

29:01.579 --> 29:03.745
I thought that guy
was bothering you.

29:05.274 --> 29:07.536
And because I think
you're really pretty.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.681
People don't really
say pretty any more.

29:16.282 --> 29:18.027
They say stuff...

29:18.453 --> 29:20.675
You know, girls or whatever,
they say...

29:21.119 --> 29:24.237
...stuff is beautiful or cute but...

29:25.343 --> 29:28.357
...I like pretty,
I like the way it sounds.

29:28.738 --> 29:29.983
<i>It's...</i>

29:30.478 --> 29:32.243
<i>It's a cool word.</i>

29:33.518 --> 29:35.792
Thanks for calling me pretty.

29:38.858 --> 29:40.454
I'm Leland.

29:41.172 --> 29:43.211
Leland P. Fitzgerald.

29:43.821 --> 29:45.477
Becky.

29:45.842 --> 29:47.305
Becky Pollard.

29:49.923 --> 29:51.656
<i>I don't blame Becky.</i>

29:53.108 --> 29:56.262
<i>I guess I'm supposed to be upset
about what happened with her.</i>

29:56.755 --> 29:58.982
<i>I'm supposed to
cry and all that junk.</i>

29:59.773 --> 30:03.135
<i>But I'm pretty sure I've cried all
the tears I had out of me by now.</i>

30:05.589 --> 30:08.285
<i>The last time I cried
was Grandma's funeral.</i>

30:09.491 --> 30:12.074
<i>Here's another one of
those things that sticks.</i>

30:12.435 --> 30:14.424
<i>I remember this other kid.</i>

30:14.822 --> 30:16.713
<i>Some cousin of
mine or something.</i>

30:17.188 --> 30:19.648
<i>Seem there real polite with
his hands folded up in his lap.</i>

30:20.181 --> 30:22.327
<i>I figured that was the
way you were supposed to be.</i>

30:22.644 --> 30:24.827
<i>I didn't want that
kid to see me crying.</i>

30:29.040 --> 30:31.039
<i>But the tears came, anyway.</i>

30:34.681 --> 30:37.258
<i>That's when I figured
out that tears couldn't</i>

30:37.613 --> 30:39.891
<i>make someone who
was dead alive again.</i>

30:43.686 --> 30:46.530
# We were given some time...

30:49.871 --> 30:52.466
<i>There's another thing
to learn about tears.</i>

31:00.501 --> 31:04.361
<i>They can't make somebody who doesn't
love you any more love you again.</i>

31:10.305 --> 31:13.187
<i>Uh-huh?
- It's me, it's Beck.</i>

31:14.453 --> 31:16.556
<i>It's the same
thing with prayers.</i>

31:17.046 --> 31:21.179
<i>I wonder how much of their lives people
waste, crying and praying to God.</i>

31:28.498 --> 31:31.642
<i>If you ask me, the devil makes
more sense than God does.</i>

31:32.053 --> 31:34.957
<i>I can at least see why
people would want him around.</i>

31:37.093 --> 31:40.579
<i>It's good to have somebody to
blame for the bad stuff they do.</i>

31:43.744 --> 31:44.879
Wha...

31:45.523 --> 31:47.309
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. I sh...

31:48.188 --> 31:50.826
It's just that this is
going kinda fast.

31:51.270 --> 31:54.456
I'm not saying that's bad...
or anything.

31:57.996 --> 32:01.332
- This just isn't normally
how I operate. - Oh.

32:01.694 --> 32:04.155
Particularly not with
somebody from work.

32:04.700 --> 32:08.425
Well, how long does it normally take you
to seduce one of your co-workers?

32:09.228 --> 32:11.544
- I didn't seduce you.
- No? - No.

32:12.026 --> 32:14.710
Oh, come on.
You're beautiful.

32:16.237 --> 32:17.855
You're beyond that.

32:17.868 --> 32:20.289
You have no idea
how beautiful you are.

32:23.064 --> 32:24.777
You're deadly.

32:26.627 --> 32:28.246
You're deadly.

32:28.663 --> 32:30.483
I'm powerless before you.

32:31.894 --> 32:34.326
- So, you hanging out for a while?
- I'm staying.

32:34.893 --> 32:36.266
Cool.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.988
That's cool, you know.

32:39.429 --> 32:40.987
That makes me happy.

32:42.606 --> 32:44.135
Cos...

32:44.673 --> 32:46.663
I kinda wanted to kiss you.

32:47.259 --> 32:49.809
# I had no light to follow...

32:50.207 --> 32:52.590
I wanna kiss you real bad,
to say it right.

32:55.170 --> 32:56.905
So can I kiss you?

32:58.012 --> 33:00.354
# I tell you how,
three days I tried

33:00.733 --> 33:03.139
# To wake me up,
oh, but no

33:03.573 --> 33:06.425
# My flesh had turned to snow

33:06.878 --> 33:09.776
# And I thought I had died...

33:10.103 --> 33:11.712
I missed you.

33:13.632 --> 33:16.617
- I always miss you.
# I have seen the face of God

33:16.907 --> 33:19.724
# And I was not afraid

33:20.317 --> 33:23.559
# I have seen the face of God

33:32.255 --> 33:35.284
- So you're a writer?
- Mmm...

33:35.919 --> 33:39.253
You're not really a writer
unless people are reading your shit.

33:39.697 --> 33:41.512
I'm an aspiring writer.

33:44.304 --> 33:46.086
What do you write about?

33:50.249 --> 33:52.131
Did you hear about that kid?

33:53.698 --> 33:56.227
The one who stabbed
that retarded kid?

33:57.449 --> 33:58.784
Yeah.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.770
I'm gonna write about him.

34:05.877 --> 34:09.422
I'm gonna write a book
about Leland P. Fitzgerald.

34:14.222 --> 34:18.386
<i>Maybe God's there because people
get scared of all the bad stuff they do.</i>

34:28.871 --> 34:31.067
<i>They figure that God
and the Devil are always</i>

34:31.376 --> 34:33.621
<i>playing this tug-of-war
game with them.</i>

34:49.612 --> 34:52.465
<i>And they never know which
side they're gonna wind up on.</i>

35:04.493 --> 35:05.864
Boo!

35:06.748 --> 35:09.060
You know, you're a
real goofball sometimes.

35:12.406 --> 35:14.140
Hey, speaking of goofballs...

35:14.565 --> 35:17.205
- Um, this is my little brother, Ryan.
- Sing a song.

35:18.165 --> 35:20.596
- Bye-bye, Ryan. See you tomorrow.
- Thanks.

35:21.975 --> 35:23.713
It's nice... nice to meet you.

35:24.157 --> 35:25.567
Sing a song!

35:26.033 --> 35:28.836
It's about all he says, but watch.

35:29.960 --> 35:32.990
- # I-I-I-Itsy-bitsy spider
- No, no!

35:34.871 --> 35:37.877
As soon as you start singing,
he gets all mad at you.

35:38.231 --> 35:40.727
You don't really know what you want,
do you, goofy?

35:41.903 --> 35:44.812
<i>I guess that tug-of-war
idea explains how sometimes...</i>

35:45.616 --> 35:48.282
<i>I mean, when people
try to do something good,</i>

35:48.689 --> 35:50.411
<i>it still turns out bad.</i>

35:53.724 --> 35:56.781
Don't use that "young lives"
BS on me, Madison.

35:57.285 --> 36:00.078
Why does this minor deserve
special consideration?

36:00.443 --> 36:04.430
I recognise you're wanting to preserve
the whole "treat everybody equal" thing.

36:04.880 --> 36:07.544
But this kid is different.
You can't deny that.

36:08.009 --> 36:11.212
We've never seen a case like
this before. Nobody has.

36:12.191 --> 36:15.935
The answer is, and will
remain in perpetuity, no.

36:16.952 --> 36:20.744
<i>I will not have you meeting with
any minor outside the classroom.</i>

36:21.223 --> 36:23.054
<i>Am I clear?</i>

36:24.211 --> 36:25.397
Very clear.

36:25.916 --> 36:28.215
So your lawyer, Charlie...
It's Charlie, right?

36:28.587 --> 36:30.331
So he explained how
all this works?

36:30.718 --> 36:33.009
You don't have to enter
a plea or say a word here.

36:33.354 --> 36:35.500
- I'm not gonna enter a plea.
- Good.

36:35.692 --> 36:37.692
I'm just gonna tell
them that I did it.

36:38.082 --> 36:41.922
Well, if you do that, then you're gonna get
shuttled out of here in a heartbeat.

36:42.283 --> 36:44.319
I don't wanna lose you yet, man.

36:44.929 --> 36:47.917
I wanna get a chance to know
what the US of L is all about.

36:49.898 --> 36:52.912
<i>I thought you said your
girlfriend was in Los Angeles?</i>

36:54.030 --> 36:56.625
- She is. - Well, how do you
explain the smell?

36:56.660 --> 36:59.511
- What smell?
- The smell of a girl.

37:10.110 --> 37:13.059
Will you at least think
about what I said?

37:13.645 --> 37:15.704
Yeah, I think about a lot of things.

37:21.741 --> 37:22.674
Hey!

37:23.618 --> 37:25.111
Hi, Mr Pollard.

37:25.652 --> 37:27.632
I'm Leland, Becky's friend.

37:28.053 --> 37:31.157
What happened?
- He rode his bike through some branches.

37:31.832 --> 37:34.055
I told him to cut it out
but he just kept going.

37:34.802 --> 37:36.810
Hey, buddy,
let me just have a look...

37:37.294 --> 37:39.898
If we don't leave in the next ten minutes...
Oh, hi. Where's Becky?

37:40.266 --> 37:43.040
<i>- What did he do?
- It's nothing. It's just a torn sleeve.</i>

37:43.363 --> 37:44.968
- Sing a song.
- I'll get him changed.

37:46.189 --> 37:48.921
I don't think he was trying
to screw up anything.

37:49.706 --> 37:52.187
It just kinda seemed
like something he had to do.

37:52.612 --> 37:54.708
Well, thanks for making
sure he got home.

37:55.052 --> 37:58.167
Oh, well, we've been walking home
together for a while now, so...

37:59.879 --> 38:03.819
<i>Did you speak Becky today? Did she
mention anything about something coming up?</i>

38:03.950 --> 38:06.381
I guess she just didn't
wanna see me today.

38:06.809 --> 38:09.385
But it's really no big deal for me
to take Ryan home.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.237
Kinda get a bang out of him.

38:13.580 --> 38:15.051
You need a ride home?

38:15.335 --> 38:17.706
Allen's about ready to head out
for baseball practice.

38:18.055 --> 38:19.916
Well, thanks, Mr Pollard.

38:26.725 --> 38:28.487
<i>Are you going to work?</i>

38:29.266 --> 38:30.365
No.

38:32.008 --> 38:33.540
No, I mean...

38:34.314 --> 38:37.087
...just for a minute, a couple of things.

39:00.677 --> 39:02.095
<i>Why did you do it?</i>

39:03.271 --> 39:04.693
<i>I got it.</i>

39:20.006 --> 39:22.209
<i>Check the door.
- Stop here.</i>

39:49.871 --> 39:53.066
<i>- Is that all, counsel?
- Yes, your Honour.</i>

39:55.607 --> 39:59.428
<i>The minor's lack of a criminal record
and the exemplary school performance</i>

39:59.802 --> 40:03.075
<i>are irrelevant matters here
due to the severity of the charges.</i>

40:03.368 --> 40:07.521
And I am denying your request that the minor
be remanded into the custody of his mother.

40:09.254 --> 40:11.880
<i>Is there something you'd like to add,
young man?</i>

40:14.577 --> 40:16.162
No, Your Honour.

40:24.126 --> 40:26.104
<i>So, do you live at the Pollards'?</i>

40:26.478 --> 40:28.240
<i>Yeah, I know what you're thinking.</i>

40:28.283 --> 40:30.869
<i>- It's a little strange?
- No.</i>

40:31.165 --> 40:34.732
- You don't think it's strange?
- No, it's just not what I was thinking.

40:37.632 --> 40:40.170
<i>I think it's kinda strange sometimes.</i>

40:43.647 --> 40:46.419
My mom died last summer.
A car accident.

40:48.544 --> 40:52.419
<i>My dad's a lot closer with Tanya.
That's my older sister.</i>

40:52.878 --> 40:54.575
He's a lot closer
with her than me, so,

40:54.917 --> 40:57.532
it really wasn't a big deal
for him when I moved.

40:57.979 --> 40:59.809
I turn on Goldencrest, right?

41:00.301 --> 41:02.281
Oh, you can just drop
me off at school.

41:02.729 --> 41:05.559
<i>Oh, I'm not going another way or anything.
It's really no big deal to take you home.</i>

41:07.083 --> 41:10.347
Mr Pollard said you had
a baseball practice or something.

41:11.507 --> 41:12.736
No.

41:13.632 --> 41:16.006
- I quit last week.
- Why did you quit?

41:16.488 --> 41:19.820
<i>I was playing terrible.
I couldn't get my head in the game.</i>

41:20.246 --> 41:23.097
And it's been a rough year
with my mom and all, so...

41:25.322 --> 41:28.134
But Julie and I are
going to ASU next year.

41:28.545 --> 41:31.526
Maybe I'll walk on there. You know,
things'll be a lot more settled, then.

41:36.251 --> 41:38.200
- Briefcase?
- Briefcase.

41:39.606 --> 41:41.064
Thanks. Appreciate it.

41:41.782 --> 41:43.477
I'm the one going home
with play-off tickets.

41:43.794 --> 41:46.725
Game three, down 0-2 to the Spurs?
That ain't much, man.

41:46.778 --> 41:48.806
The Suns never get out of the first round.

41:49.093 --> 41:51.699
I don't know, man, Marbury's
hitting his shots, we play up tempo?

41:52.058 --> 41:54.380
- Damn fine ball club.
- Your lips.

41:54.765 --> 41:57.769
- I see this kid got to you, too, huh?
- What do you mean?

41:58.363 --> 42:01.207
C'mon man, it's always hard for
me to picture these pimply

42:01.662 --> 42:03.902
little mama's boys doing
what you know they did.

42:04.343 --> 42:08.353
But this one even more so than the others.
I can't see this kid hurting a fly.

42:08.770 --> 42:10.318
He's definitely fascinating.

42:10.800 --> 42:13.811
Yeah, well, you're the writer.
You give it a word.

42:14.268 --> 42:16.069
That's precisely what I plan to do.

42:30.217 --> 42:32.342
Oh, have you ever read Proust?

42:32.883 --> 42:34.978
I know what you
want from me.

42:35.533 --> 42:36.836
Yeah?

42:37.524 --> 42:40.726
I just... I just want you
to have somebody to talk to.

42:45.089 --> 42:47.519
It's the same thing they
want from the trial.

42:47.915 --> 42:49.305
What's that?

42:51.434 --> 42:53.059
You want a why.

42:54.160 --> 42:56.678
Well, maybe there
isn't one. Maybe...

42:57.077 --> 42:59.637
Maybe this is just
something that happened.

43:07.842 --> 43:09.233
Excuse me.

43:10.597 --> 43:12.830
<i>- Isn't the game on?
- What game?</i>

43:15.241 --> 43:18.924
- Could you please just change
the channel? - Yeah.

43:21.276 --> 43:23.223
It's depressing me, too.

43:31.927 --> 43:33.543
I like that title.

43:33.957 --> 43:36.984
<i>It's not supposed to mean
I'm the President or anything.</i>

43:37.499 --> 43:39.537
Mostly it's just a joke.

43:41.568 --> 43:43.548
Well, what do you write about?

43:43.972 --> 43:45.942
I guess, how I see the world.

43:48.008 --> 43:51.358
- How do you see the world, Pearl?
- Full of possibilities.

43:51.892 --> 43:55.979
I think that good things abound,
positive things. What about you?

43:58.808 --> 44:00.915
There's two ways to see it.

44:01.915 --> 44:04.756
One is like what you said,
where life is OK.

44:05.570 --> 44:08.726
Where maybe stuff's wrong
but you just don't see it.

44:09.042 --> 44:10.754
What's the other way?

44:12.403 --> 44:14.336
When you see
what's really there.

44:14.978 --> 44:17.623
He didn't give you any idea
what that might have meant?

44:20.928 --> 44:22.552
He didn't say much.

44:23.316 --> 44:27.168
When I got home,
all he said was that he'd made a mistake.

44:28.824 --> 44:32.912
I saw his hand and I drove
him to the hospital.

44:34.125 --> 44:36.859
He didn't make a
sound on the drive.

44:38.350 --> 44:40.261
It's always there.

44:41.535 --> 44:43.776
Even when stuff looks good.

44:44.239 --> 44:48.158
When kids are playing,
couples are kissing and junk.

44:48.515 --> 44:52.111
It's in all of that stuff. But mostly,
people just look right through it.

44:53.051 --> 44:54.993
What's the "it"?

44:55.567 --> 44:57.557
I mean, what don't they see?

44:58.037 --> 45:00.655
Just how everything's
always slipping away.

45:02.292 --> 45:04.871
How everyone's always
kind of dying inside.

45:05.638 --> 45:08.020
<i>How sad everybody really is.</i>

45:08.852 --> 45:11.803
And seeing things this
way makes you feel sad?

45:13.587 --> 45:16.114
It doesn't make me
feel much of anything.

45:18.308 --> 45:21.445
<i>Did you notice anything
different about him?</i>

45:21.855 --> 45:23.365
Today?

45:23.928 --> 45:25.219
<i>When he visited.</i>

45:25.752 --> 45:27.504
Nothing unusual.

45:28.954 --> 45:30.915
<i>Ever since he
got back this time,</i>

45:31.510 --> 45:34.698
<i>from the moment I
picked him up at the airport...</i>

45:37.370 --> 45:39.724
...something wasn't
right with him.

45:41.554 --> 45:44.583
I figured maybe the
two of you had a fight.

45:45.127 --> 45:46.527
No.

45:47.584 --> 45:50.162
Perhaps he was just
upset about that girl.

45:50.678 --> 45:53.287
Sometimes, things don't
work out between people.

45:53.988 --> 45:56.151
And it's nobody's fault.

45:57.445 --> 46:00.472
<i>- That's a very mature approach.
- I don't know.</i>

46:01.414 --> 46:04.588
Well, you tell me.
How's your girl?

46:04.991 --> 46:08.087
- Miranda? Oh, Miranda's great.
- I meant the other girl.

46:08.782 --> 46:11.293
Oh, that's just something
that happened.

46:12.437 --> 46:16.652
Would it hurt Miranda if she found out
about this something that happened?

46:17.048 --> 46:18.401
Yeah.

46:19.977 --> 46:21.832
<i>So, why did you do it?</i>

46:25.837 --> 46:27.740
She's not gonna find out.

46:30.110 --> 46:31.795
<i>Does that make it OK?</i>

46:32.217 --> 46:33.627
OK?

46:35.303 --> 46:38.354
Look, Miranda's been gone
for a long time now, OK?

46:38.582 --> 46:40.757
I'm not even really
sure where we stand.

46:41.155 --> 46:42.990
And I'm only human, man.

46:43.357 --> 46:46.490
It's funny how people only say
that after they do something bad.

46:49.036 --> 46:51.075
You never hear someone say,

46:51.499 --> 46:54.968
"I'm only human" after they
rescue a kid from a burning building.

47:04.190 --> 47:06.237
- Thanks for the ride.
- You bet.

47:13.215 --> 47:14.861
Hey, Leland.

47:19.243 --> 47:21.516
There's something
I wanted to tell you...

47:21.988 --> 47:23.791
about Becky.

47:27.416 --> 47:30.186
You know the reason she's
in that probation school, right?

47:31.391 --> 47:33.431
She told me she messed up.

47:34.677 --> 47:36.556
You didn't ask how?

47:39.407 --> 47:41.899
I figured she'd tell me
if it was important.

47:45.415 --> 47:47.412
It was drug stuff.

47:50.702 --> 47:53.418
Listen, I don't wanna tell you
anything you don't wanna hear.

47:53.916 --> 47:56.463
No, you can tell me.
You can tell me.

47:59.013 --> 48:01.010
She kind of fell in
with this guy,

48:01.471 --> 48:03.704
this older guy, Kevin.

48:04.818 --> 48:06.817
I don't know, he's, like, 20.

48:08.111 --> 48:10.082
<i>He's a drug dealer.</i>

48:12.737 --> 48:16.150
<i>She ran away with him
for a while last year.</i>

48:16.569 --> 48:18.399
<i>It got really, really messy.</i>

48:19.181 --> 48:22.015
Mrs Pollard had to go
pull her out of there.

48:22.584 --> 48:25.571
<i>- But...
- What?</i>

48:26.595 --> 48:29.010
<i>Kevin got out of jail today.</i>

48:31.113 --> 48:32.453
Mrs Pollard.

48:32.839 --> 48:35.242
The receipt will take a minute so
I'll go ahead and bring her round.

48:39.331 --> 48:40.879
What's the damage?

48:41.099 --> 48:43.096
I didn't even look.
I just signed.

48:43.382 --> 48:45.774
<i>- What's today? The date today?
- It's the 24th.</i>

48:46.186 --> 48:48.479
Julie is running up against
the ASU deadline.

48:48.885 --> 48:50.916
- You sent yours in, didn't you?
- Yeah.

48:51.525 --> 48:53.565
Yeah, I don't know, erm...

48:53.901 --> 48:55.360
Maybe...

48:55.733 --> 48:58.037
<i>Maybe she's still
not sure, you know.</i>

49:01.158 --> 49:02.597
I don't know.

49:03.057 --> 49:06.808
Maybe she just wants to make sure
it's the best place for her.

49:08.229 --> 49:11.030
<i>I saw you the other night,
the way you were holding her,</i>

49:11.394 --> 49:13.942
<i>the way you look at her
even when she's asleep.</i>

49:15.353 --> 49:17.393
Take care of Julie for me.

49:17.896 --> 49:20.424
I can't lose her, too.
She's all I have left.

49:23.315 --> 49:26.542
Look at that sunshine.
I don't even remember what it feels like.

49:32.287 --> 49:34.208
What did you do to get in here?

49:37.499 --> 49:39.430
Wrong place, wrong time.

49:41.587 --> 49:43.409
That's against the law?

49:43.947 --> 49:47.993
If you're a 17-year-old black dude
with an old-school Dr J'fro, it is.

49:48.549 --> 49:50.290
See you in class, devil boy.

49:54.720 --> 49:56.275
Long live Satan.

50:09.826 --> 50:11.079
<i>Hey, pick up.</i>

50:11.973 --> 50:15.314
<i>I know you're sitting there with
a bottle of wine watching basketball.</i>

50:15.686 --> 50:17.322
<i>I can see you.</i>

50:18.361 --> 50:20.250
<i>Er, OK, fine.</i>

50:20.547 --> 50:21.461
<i>Um...</i>

50:22.142 --> 50:26.151
<i>I miss you and I wanna
see you again already.</i>

50:26.518 --> 50:28.859
<i>I was thinking, you know,
since I'm stuck here,</i>

50:29.241 --> 50:31.279
<i>maybe you could
come up and visit.</i>

50:31.493 --> 50:33.544
<i>I know it wasn't part
of the plan but...</i>

50:41.627 --> 50:44.615
<i>All right, could you check
on the name Martin Angle?</i>

50:47.984 --> 50:49.642
<i>OK, er... one second.</i>

50:50.032 --> 50:52.973
Could you check David Stith?
S - T - I - T - H.

50:56.247 --> 50:59.706
<i>I'm sorry, there's just one more.
Edgar Pinkerton.</i>

51:03.619 --> 51:07.167
You do? OK, could you tell me
the room number that Mr...

51:08.438 --> 51:10.527
No, OK, that's fine.
That's fine.

51:11.269 --> 51:13.311
Is there a bar in the hotel?

51:16.692 --> 51:17.759
<i>Hi.</i>

51:19.452 --> 51:20.864
Er, excuse me?

51:21.413 --> 51:23.825
They won't let me get
a pitcher if I'm alone

51:24.167 --> 51:26.677
so I was wondering if I could say
that I'm drinking with you?

51:28.059 --> 51:29.618
Fiction or non?

51:32.541 --> 51:33.795
Fiction.

51:35.106 --> 51:38.114
Yeah, you can sit down if you want, but
you should have checked at the bar first.

51:38.526 --> 51:40.388
<i>- They don't have anything
on tap here. - Ah.</i>

51:40.754 --> 51:42.538
<i>- Drink?
- Please, thank you.</i>

51:44.471 --> 51:46.359
I'm sorry to be
intruding like this.

51:46.767 --> 51:49.128
<i>Its just, I'm a big fan.
I've read everything you've ever written.</i>

51:49.558 --> 51:51.374
Evidently, Edgar Falling included.

51:51.834 --> 51:55.292
And now that you've read my work, you know
I'm not a fag so I don't wanna fuck you,

51:55.653 --> 51:57.770
and you've probably heard
that I'm an asshole, so...

51:58.132 --> 52:02.534
I'm not going to read your passionate
semi-autobiographical first novel

52:02.928 --> 52:04.846
and pass it on to my agent.

52:05.902 --> 52:09.095
I work at the juvenile hall
where Leland's being detained.

52:13.095 --> 52:15.749
- How's he holding up?
- He's fine.

52:16.534 --> 52:19.317
Well, no, he's in Special Handling,
so he's isolated now.

52:19.762 --> 52:21.123
<i>Can you get me in to see him?</i>

52:21.508 --> 52:23.783
Oh, I don't have that kinda juice.
I'm just a teacher there.

52:24.105 --> 52:26.488
Visiting day's next
Sunday if you wanna...

52:26.788 --> 52:28.728
You don't think
I'm aware of that?

52:31.207 --> 52:32.541
<i>Did he do it?</i>

52:33.842 --> 52:36.402
I'm not really allowed to talk about
that outside the facility.

52:36.748 --> 52:38.503
Perhaps he told
you something?

52:40.608 --> 52:41.827
Yeah.

52:43.084 --> 52:44.937
<i>Yeah, he says he did it.</i>

52:46.103 --> 52:49.271
But I don't know why.
I don't think he knows why, either.

52:49.827 --> 52:51.716
You know your son,
he's very detached.

52:51.998 --> 52:54.967
Most of the time, he seems
completely disinterested in his own fate.

52:55.770 --> 52:58.006
Uninterested in his own fate?

52:58.677 --> 53:00.698
Look, if you think I'm
gonna be able to provide

53:01.160 --> 53:03.149
some insight into Leland,
you're wrong.

53:03.513 --> 53:06.376
<i>There are no private spaces
in my son's heart reserved for me.</i>

53:06.761 --> 53:09.205
- There never have been.
- You moved to Paris...

53:09.651 --> 53:12.367
America's Too Loud,
that was what? '94, '95?

53:12.669 --> 53:14.265
So Leland was...?

53:14.514 --> 53:16.663
Chronologies have never
been my strong suit.

53:17.014 --> 53:19.609
Well, was he angry with you for leaving,
for moving away?

53:19.981 --> 53:24.067
I'm not really that adept at gauging
people's emotional reactions to events.

53:24.325 --> 53:26.188
I disagree.
I've read your books.

53:26.647 --> 53:29.019
Mmm, so have I.

53:29.565 --> 53:31.124
They haven't helped.

53:31.478 --> 53:33.240
Well, he still visits
you out there, right?

53:33.652 --> 53:35.777
He said he gets out there
a couple of times a year, so...

53:36.203 --> 53:37.899
What are your visits like?

53:42.016 --> 53:43.869
Chapter Two, right?

53:44.242 --> 53:45.760
I'm sorry?

53:46.145 --> 53:47.479
<i>Fiction.</i>

53:48.694 --> 53:50.694
<i>You're not here out
of some selfless devotion</i>

53:51.056 --> 53:53.604
to my son or your
admiration for my work.

53:53.910 --> 53:57.859
<i>You're here because you smell
a good book. And I'm Chapter Two.</i>

54:02.166 --> 54:03.999
I wanna write about your son.

54:04.359 --> 54:06.301
But I don't wanna exploit him.

54:06.561 --> 54:08.244
There's no distinction.

54:09.409 --> 54:11.010
Good luck with your novel.

54:11.374 --> 54:14.147
Maybe I'll pick it up in the supermarket
checkout line one of these days.

54:21.192 --> 54:24.935
Well, the truth is, I haven't actually
seen my dad since I was six.

54:25.576 --> 54:28.379
I don't understand,
I thought you travelled with him?

54:29.148 --> 54:30.568
Well...

54:33.225 --> 54:36.333
He's sent me plane tickets,
one in the spring, one in the winter,

54:36.638 --> 54:38.695
every year since I was 12.

54:39.005 --> 54:40.848
But you never went to Paris?

54:42.769 --> 54:45.504
I never really talked to
my dad after he left.

54:46.829 --> 54:50.789
Sometimes he'd send me money
for my birthday, junk like that.

54:52.551 --> 54:55.934
One year, he just decided he wanted me
to come visit him for Christmas.

54:57.455 --> 55:00.864
<i>But I had to fly to New York first,
then catch a plane to Paris.</i>

55:02.041 --> 55:03.931
<i>Once I got there, though,</i>

55:04.119 --> 55:07.005
<i>I just kinda decided
to stay in New York.</i>

55:07.409 --> 55:11.370
<i>I told my dad about how there was
this sort of electricity in the air there</i>

55:11.813 --> 55:14.804
<i>and how I wanted to stay.
He was OK with it.</i>

55:15.523 --> 55:19.003
<i>He even said something like
I was a real neat kid for doing it.</i>

55:19.688 --> 55:22.181
<i>Once I got there,
I couldn't find a hotel.</i>

55:23.060 --> 55:27.266
<i>No-one would give me a room. They
were all so worried to give a kid a room.</i>

55:27.588 --> 55:29.184
<i>But it didn't seem
to bother them to send</i>

55:29.531 --> 55:32.168
<i>that same kid onto the
street with no place to go.</i>

55:33.076 --> 55:35.341
<i>So I decided to hide
out for a while.</i>

55:35.732 --> 55:37.641
<i>And I found this
movie theatre.</i>

55:38.669 --> 55:42.877
<i>And after the first movie,
this family came and sat down next to me.</i>

55:43.433 --> 55:48.606
<i>And the dad, I guess he noticed the
two big duffel bags that I had next to me.</i>

55:49.009 --> 55:52.704
<i>He made some corny joke about
whether I was staying for a while.</i>

55:54.293 --> 55:56.781
<i>I told him how I
came to be in New York.</i>

55:57.223 --> 55:59.174
<i>That got the
Mom's attention.</i>

56:00.517 --> 56:02.399
<i>Her name's Angela.</i>

56:02.946 --> 56:05.288
<i>But I called her
Mrs Calderon then.</i>

56:07.791 --> 56:11.850
<i>She was worried about me. She said I
could come stay with them for the holidays.</i>

56:13.215 --> 56:15.300
<i>I said it sounded pretty good.</i>

56:16.386 --> 56:18.826
<i>You could tell her
place cost a fortune.</i>

56:19.379 --> 56:21.134
<i>And her daughter...</i>

56:22.065 --> 56:24.496
<i>She was kind of snobby, but OK.</i>

56:24.746 --> 56:27.998
<i>She just kept trying to kiss me,
and I wasn't into it then.</i>

56:29.214 --> 56:32.566
<i>They were all really nice to me,
but particularly Mrs Calderon.</i>

56:35.095 --> 56:37.700
<i>I just loved looking
into her eyes.</i>

56:38.288 --> 56:41.781
It was like they reflected
the electricity of the whole city.

56:44.036 --> 56:46.916
I didn't feel lonely at all
when I was around her.

56:48.875 --> 56:50.908
She kinda made me feel like...

56:51.213 --> 56:52.632
<i>everything was OK.</i>

56:53.114 --> 56:56.189
Or like stuff was wrong
but you couldn't see it?

57:00.270 --> 57:03.259
When my dad sent me
another ticket that spring,

57:04.522 --> 57:07.824
I kinda figured maybe I'd just
go back to New York instead.

57:08.246 --> 57:10.600
But this ticket was for Italy.

57:11.117 --> 57:15.261
And my dad said I should fly to a new place
each time, see the world that way.

57:15.656 --> 57:18.496
- It could be our little secret.
- Where did you go the last time?

57:20.416 --> 57:23.652
<i>Well, my dad said I should
see New York in the spring.</i>

57:25.006 --> 57:27.015
Did you see the Calderons?

57:29.691 --> 57:31.622
<i>Did something happen?</i>

57:34.132 --> 57:35.797
Well, it's a big city.

57:36.332 --> 57:38.637
Something's always happening in New York.

58:07.403 --> 58:08.957
- What the fuck, dude?
- Where is she?

58:09.266 --> 58:11.114
<i>Where's who? And who are you?</i>

58:13.762 --> 58:14.957
<i>Allen!</i>

58:15.889 --> 58:18.937
- Come on, let's go.
- Where are we going? Go where?

58:19.673 --> 58:21.703
Here, get dressed.
I'm gonna take you home. Come on.

58:22.098 --> 58:23.186
<i>Look, man...</i>

58:23.641 --> 58:25.874
Hey, listen, OK,
I'm not gonna beat you.

58:26.065 --> 58:28.400
But this isn't fucking right.
This is my place.

58:28.523 --> 58:30.937
I don't know who the fuck you are.
I just wanna know...

58:31.297 --> 58:32.797
who the fuck you are, OK?

58:39.267 --> 58:40.384
<i>Stop!</i>

58:41.747 --> 58:44.157
Do you have any idea
what you're doing to her family?

58:44.931 --> 58:46.590
<i>Do you care?</i>

58:47.088 --> 58:48.604
<i>- Stop!
- Do you even fucking care?</i>

58:48.781 --> 58:52.055
- Stop kicking him! Stop!
- You're destroying her family!

58:52.208 --> 58:53.570
Stop!

58:55.419 --> 58:57.289
You fucking junkie!

59:02.749 --> 59:04.611
Stupid junkie fuck.

59:21.945 --> 59:24.728
<i>I don't think I know
what the definition of love is.</i>

59:25.149 --> 59:27.520
<i>You know in your heart
if you love somebody.</i>

59:29.225 --> 59:31.178
<i>But it's not in your heart.</i>

59:32.665 --> 59:35.411
<i>Love's on your tongue.
It's a word, that's all.</i>

59:36.714 --> 59:39.059
OK, did you tell Becky you loved her?

59:41.667 --> 59:43.714
<i>She said she loved you?</i>

59:45.380 --> 59:47.388
But she still broke
up with you, right?

59:47.788 --> 59:49.582
<i>I'm not angry with her.</i>

59:50.476 --> 59:52.270
<i>I was never angry with her.</i>

59:52.770 --> 59:55.456
It's OK to be angry.
I mean, you're practically entitled to it.

59:57.289 --> 59:58.601
Why?

59:59.650 --> 01:00:01.475
<i>You're only human.</i>

01:00:02.056 --> 01:00:04.164
I mean, you are human, aren't you?

01:00:08.653 --> 01:00:10.534
Well, if you say so, Pearl.

01:00:12.344 --> 01:00:14.463
Thank you for what you did today.

01:00:17.922 --> 01:00:20.021
I think we should talk.

01:00:20.431 --> 01:00:23.344
I know that this doesn't seem
like the best time, but...

01:00:23.643 --> 01:00:25.437
Julie, I found that letter.

01:00:27.830 --> 01:00:29.946
I found the letter to Iowa.

01:00:31.082 --> 01:00:32.837
And er...

01:00:33.244 --> 01:00:35.740
If you've changed your mind, I understand.

01:00:36.811 --> 01:00:40.260
But... why didn't you tell me?

01:00:40.697 --> 01:00:43.403
Or ask me or something, you know?

01:00:46.822 --> 01:00:48.305
It's OK.

01:00:49.716 --> 01:00:52.802
It's OK, because I can go out
there with you and I'll...

01:00:52.847 --> 01:00:55.415
I'll apply to school
there next semester.

01:00:56.554 --> 01:00:59.666
This isn't about where I go to school,
it's about us.

01:01:02.252 --> 01:01:03.350
Oh.

01:01:04.673 --> 01:01:05.906
OK.

01:01:09.026 --> 01:01:11.024
Well, you know what I think.

01:01:11.479 --> 01:01:13.146
So...

01:01:13.688 --> 01:01:17.668
If you have something to say, you should
say it. Because I don't have anything.

01:01:20.726 --> 01:01:24.694
Maybe we shouldn't plan
like we're gonna move off together.

01:01:27.819 --> 01:01:32.465
Does that mean what? Does that
mean we're... not going to or...?

01:01:32.912 --> 01:01:35.146
I love you, Allen, but...

01:01:37.695 --> 01:01:40.802
- But... - But we've been
together for a really long time,

01:01:40.814 --> 01:01:42.473
really close,

01:01:42.923 --> 01:01:45.095
like we're married
since you moved in.

01:01:45.581 --> 01:01:47.581
And everything's so set...

01:01:48.076 --> 01:01:50.319
Sorry to interrupt, but er...

01:01:50.679 --> 01:01:52.769
I wanted us all to
talk about tomorrow.

01:01:53.067 --> 01:01:55.302
OK, we'll be right there.

01:02:03.368 --> 01:02:07.238
I don't know, it just doesn't really
feel right to me any more, and...

01:02:08.922 --> 01:02:10.991
Maybe it was just...

01:02:11.434 --> 01:02:14.778
too much too soon, you know?
Or that we both changed.

01:02:15.225 --> 01:02:18.258
No, I haven't changed.
I haven't changed.

01:02:18.697 --> 01:02:21.497
Then I've changed.
And what I want has changed.

01:02:21.783 --> 01:02:24.264
I don't want you to go
out with me to Iowa.

01:02:26.615 --> 01:02:28.400
I'm really sorry.

01:02:29.810 --> 01:02:31.428
No, wait, Julie!

01:02:31.821 --> 01:02:33.299
Hey, Julie.

01:02:33.708 --> 01:02:35.120
Julie.

01:02:56.218 --> 01:02:58.159
<i>OK, here's the definition.</i>

01:02:59.581 --> 01:03:01.963
<i>Love is when you can't get
somebody out of your mind.</i>

01:03:03.030 --> 01:03:06.588
<i>When they're your first thought in the
morning and your last thought at night.</i>

01:03:07.487 --> 01:03:10.677
<i>Maybe it's not in your heart,
but it is in your head.</i>

01:03:13.291 --> 01:03:14.607
OK.

01:03:15.794 --> 01:03:18.939
<i>So, do you think about Becky?</i>

01:03:22.094 --> 01:03:23.838
All the time.

01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.075
You don't have anything to
worry about, I promise.

01:03:29.671 --> 01:03:32.064
If you have to wake me up
in the middle of the night

01:03:32.447 --> 01:03:35.581
to tell me that I don't have
anything to worry about,

01:03:36.051 --> 01:03:39.168
it kinda makes it seem like
I do have something to worry about.

01:03:40.787 --> 01:03:43.578
I just wanted to
see a familiar face.

01:03:44.137 --> 01:03:46.463
I just wanted someone to talk to.

01:03:48.167 --> 01:03:50.577
Talk to at two o'clock
in the morning?

01:03:52.586 --> 01:03:55.781
Look, I'm really sorry, OK,
I didn't show up today, but...

01:03:55.998 --> 01:03:58.631
it just sort of came up,
you know, I didn't...

01:03:59.623 --> 01:04:01.877
Look, you're my
guardian angel, right?

01:04:01.921 --> 01:04:03.509
I can count on you.

01:04:06.051 --> 01:04:08.519
- Do you love this guy?
- No.

01:04:13.923 --> 01:04:16.440
You don't have to be
afraid to tell me the truth.

01:04:20.148 --> 01:04:21.756
I don't know.

01:04:23.067 --> 01:04:24.803
You don't know?

01:04:26.166 --> 01:04:28.313
No. I...

01:04:29.883 --> 01:04:32.012
Look, I'm sorry, OK?
I just...

01:04:32.392 --> 01:04:34.657
I'm confused and I don't...

01:04:35.152 --> 01:04:37.005
I don't really mean...

01:04:38.153 --> 01:04:41.779
Maybe we shouldn't talk.
We should talk tomorrow, you know?

01:04:42.789 --> 01:04:46.780
It's just I really wanted to see you
because you're so good to me.

01:04:47.964 --> 01:04:50.035
But that's not enough.

01:04:50.513 --> 01:04:52.758
No, it's not like that.

01:04:54.071 --> 01:04:55.559
Please.

01:04:56.154 --> 01:04:58.037
I need you, OK?

01:04:59.615 --> 01:05:01.539
I need you really badly.

01:05:03.174 --> 01:05:07.549
You don't have anything to worry about, OK?
Just... trust me.

01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:26.984
<i>I'm sorry, honey.</i>

01:05:27.793 --> 01:05:29.617
Is everything OK?

01:05:48.436 --> 01:05:50.082
Shit!

01:05:50.663 --> 01:05:52.375
Shit...

01:05:57.074 --> 01:05:58.444
Hello?

01:05:59.149 --> 01:06:01.336
I didn't hear the phone ring.

01:06:02.445 --> 01:06:05.258
Oh, yeah, erm...

01:06:05.597 --> 01:06:07.991
No, he's in the shower.
Can I...?

01:06:08.899 --> 01:06:10.379
Hello?

01:06:11.499 --> 01:06:12.892
Hello?

01:06:16.017 --> 01:06:18.517
Calm down.
If you calm down, I can explain it.

01:06:18.867 --> 01:06:20.691
But I can't explain it if...

01:06:21.254 --> 01:06:22.477
Mira...

01:06:22.804 --> 01:06:24.317
No, I'm not gonna lie to you.

01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:26.445
<i>I'm not gonna lie to you,
I wanna talk.</i>

01:06:26.845 --> 01:06:29.402
<i>But I wanna talk like, you know,
two normal, rational...</i>

01:06:32.601 --> 01:06:35.189
You know, you've been gone
for three fucking months, OK?

01:06:35.535 --> 01:06:36.916
Mira...

01:06:38.257 --> 01:06:40.143
If you'd just let
me fucking explain.

01:06:40.372 --> 01:06:43.225
- Did you fuck her?
- Come on, Leland, come on.

01:06:43.574 --> 01:06:45.191
I just wanna know if
you fucked her.

01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:47.551
That's not relevant to
what we're doing here.

01:06:48.006 --> 01:06:49.967
- Well, what are we doing here?
- We're talking.

01:06:50.367 --> 01:06:53.410
- Mostly, I'm talking.
- I'm trying to help you.

01:06:56.107 --> 01:06:57.999
Maybe I'm trying to help you.

01:06:58.566 --> 01:07:01.401
I'm not the one who did
something wrong to get here.

01:07:03.958 --> 01:07:06.765
Just because what I did is wrong
doesn't make what you're doing right.

01:07:07.196 --> 01:07:09.303
No, I never said right.
I never made that distinction.

01:07:09.763 --> 01:07:10.910
Right.

01:07:11.475 --> 01:07:13.475
You only said you were human.

01:07:14.875 --> 01:07:17.796
- That explains it.
- OK, I'm a bastard. Does that do it?

01:07:18.169 --> 01:07:21.260
- I did it cos I'm a bastard, OK?
- And you wanted to.

01:07:22.574 --> 01:07:25.622
I mean, you wanted
to fuck that other girl.

01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.626
Yeah, I wanted to.

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.585
I wanted to.

01:07:34.799 --> 01:07:37.758
I don't see what's wrong
with me asking you that.

01:07:38.818 --> 01:07:40.808
Just talking, right?

01:07:52.178 --> 01:07:54.217
We went to my place.

01:07:55.472 --> 01:07:57.225
And er...

01:07:57.618 --> 01:08:00.433
There was a message on
the machine from Miranda.

01:08:00.871 --> 01:08:03.194
There was just this
earthquake in LA.

01:08:03.587 --> 01:08:06.339
And she woke up scared,
just terrified.

01:08:06.826 --> 01:08:09.956
And instead of calling her back,

01:08:10.436 --> 01:08:12.544
instead of calling
my girlfriend back,

01:08:13.105 --> 01:08:15.093
I fucked some other chick.

01:08:16.082 --> 01:08:18.466
I knew it was wrong but...

01:08:19.044 --> 01:08:21.082
...I did it anyway.

01:08:27.268 --> 01:08:30.131
<i>You know what the funny thing
about earthquakes is?</i>

01:08:30.568 --> 01:08:35.457
After an earthquake, you see people pulling
other people out of broken-down buildings,

01:08:35.911 --> 01:08:38.099
<i>people hugging and junk,
because</i>

01:08:38.511 --> 01:08:42.219
<i>they saw a little girl's shoe in
the road and no little girl around.</i>

01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.979
Then, a couple of days later,
they forget all about it.

01:08:47.224 --> 01:08:50.178
It still shows you that
there's goodness in people.

01:08:50.587 --> 01:08:52.747
Well, during earthquakes, at least.

01:08:53.456 --> 01:08:55.109
People make mistakes.

01:08:56.602 --> 01:09:00.363
People are fallible.
We are fallible, Leland.

01:09:00.817 --> 01:09:02.676
Even with the best intentions,

01:09:03.036 --> 01:09:06.381
most people don't have the inner strength
it takes to do good all the time.

01:09:07.238 --> 01:09:08.707
I guess.

01:09:09.609 --> 01:09:12.334
Look, what happened with Becky?

01:09:12.765 --> 01:09:15.727
I don't blame Becky.
I know you think that's why, but it isn't.

01:09:16.125 --> 01:09:17.537
It's not about why.

01:09:18.024 --> 01:09:21.740
Look, I just hurt somebody.
I feel terrible, I fucked up.

01:09:22.126 --> 01:09:25.577
I'd feel better knowing that I'm sitting
with somebody who fucks up, too.

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:30.715
Well, you know what happened.
She broke up with me for that other guy.

01:09:31.094 --> 01:09:32.937
<i>I don't wanna hurt you, OK?</i>

01:09:35.377 --> 01:09:36.818
So, don't.

01:09:37.285 --> 01:09:40.029
<i>Sometimes, things don't work out.
It's nobody's fault.</i>

01:09:40.331 --> 01:09:41.754
That's bullshit.

01:09:42.666 --> 01:09:44.330
That's bullshit!

01:09:44.451 --> 01:09:46.451
It's her fault.
She lied to you.

01:09:46.832 --> 01:09:49.077
- I don't see it that way.
- But, at some point, you did.

01:09:49.263 --> 01:09:50.821
I'm sorry, I get...

01:09:51.283 --> 01:09:53.107
confused, you know?

01:09:53.696 --> 01:09:55.462
I'm not like you.

01:09:55.802 --> 01:09:58.902
<i>You say it's hurting you, but it doesn't
seem like it matters one way or another.</i>

01:09:59.298 --> 01:10:01.288
- It matters.
- At some point, you got angry.

01:10:01.769 --> 01:10:04.344
- Prove it to me. Show it to me.
- How do I show it?

01:10:04.715 --> 01:10:08.154
You said things and you did things that
it didn't make any sense to say and do.

01:10:08.546 --> 01:10:10.975
It didn't change anything,
but you did them anyway.

01:10:11.518 --> 01:10:14.675
<i>Yell at you?
Should I scream at you?</i>

01:10:15.081 --> 01:10:16.061
Hit you?

01:10:16.699 --> 01:10:19.611
Is that how I show you it matters?
If I hit you, it matters?

01:10:25.457 --> 01:10:26.710
I love you.

01:10:34.489 --> 01:10:36.187
What else can I say?

01:10:38.695 --> 01:10:41.311
Nothing I say is gonna
change anything.

01:10:41.726 --> 01:10:43.882
Cos you love somebody else.

01:10:47.863 --> 01:10:50.441
I didn't like being the kind
of person that did that.

01:10:50.976 --> 01:10:52.633
What kind of person?

01:10:53.104 --> 01:10:55.123
Like everybody else?

01:10:58.475 --> 01:11:00.287
I didn't like the way it felt.

01:11:00.659 --> 01:11:03.413
But you liked how it felt when
you were in love with her, right?

01:11:05.905 --> 01:11:08.197
It's all part of the trade-off, man.

01:11:09.041 --> 01:11:10.775
Love's only...

01:11:11.038 --> 01:11:14.213
such a great thing because you know
what it feels like to get your heart broken,

01:11:14.967 --> 01:11:17.308
what it feels like to be alone.

01:11:21.473 --> 01:11:23.169
There was...

01:11:24.061 --> 01:11:28.666
...something I said before,
something that was kind of a lie.

01:11:29.156 --> 01:11:30.461
About what?

01:11:32.078 --> 01:11:35.213
It's about how it doesn't make me
feel much of anything.

01:11:37.908 --> 01:11:41.261
Mostly, I keep it out, but...

01:11:42.030 --> 01:11:43.785
When you can't?

01:11:44.776 --> 01:11:46.716
I don't know.

01:11:49.301 --> 01:11:51.016
It covers my eyes.

01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:54.497
It's just all I can see.

01:11:56.487 --> 01:11:59.356
Say, there's some
kids playing baseball.

01:12:00.485 --> 01:12:05.277
All I see is the one kid they won't let
play because he tells corny jokes.

01:12:06.873 --> 01:12:08.882
No-one thinks they're funny.

01:12:09.305 --> 01:12:11.079
Or I see a boy and a girl in love,

01:12:11.466 --> 01:12:13.278
and kissing, you know...

01:12:13.299 --> 01:12:16.613
I just see that they're gonna be one
of those sad, old couples one day,

01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:20.645
<i>who just cheat on each other and
can't even look each other in the eye.</i>

01:12:23.811 --> 01:12:26.988
<i>And I feel it.
I feel all of their sadness.</i>

01:12:29.406 --> 01:12:32.758
I feel it probably even worse
than that sad old couple or that...

01:12:33.009 --> 01:12:35.334
corny kid will ever feel it.

01:12:36.453 --> 01:12:38.764
<i>Do you feel like that now?</i>

01:12:40.725 --> 01:12:42.969
Well, mostly, I keep it out.

01:12:44.832 --> 01:12:47.653
Did you feel like that
after you fought with Becky?

01:12:49.288 --> 01:12:51.208
I don't know, maybe.

01:12:52.454 --> 01:12:54.641
After you got back from New York?

01:12:57.885 --> 01:12:59.433
It doesn't matter.

01:13:01.274 --> 01:13:04.519
Cos telling you about it
and getting you all sad and junk...

01:13:06.859 --> 01:13:09.015
...well, it never changes anything.

01:13:09.388 --> 01:13:11.980
Cos nothing can make
what happened unhappen.

01:13:22.018 --> 01:13:23.624
Excuse me, Mr Pollard, sir?

01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:26.059
Oh, please, this isn't the time.

01:13:26.612 --> 01:13:28.535
We were hoping
that you might just...

01:13:28.898 --> 01:13:31.448
<i>I'm asking you aa
a favour, please...</i>

01:13:34.555 --> 01:13:38.346
- Sir, I respect your situation.
- Well, thank you for that.

01:13:38.639 --> 01:13:41.118
- But we were hoping that you might...
- Hoping I might what?

01:13:42.168 --> 01:13:44.315
Hoping I might what?
We're in grief here.

01:13:44.678 --> 01:13:46.519
<i>- How is that a story?
- Harry...</i>

01:13:46.841 --> 01:13:48.888
<i>How is my daughter
crying a story?</i>

01:13:49.230 --> 01:13:51.198
<i>We didn't do anything
wrong, all right?</i>

01:13:51.521 --> 01:13:53.289
<i>We just...
We lost a child.</i>

01:13:53.685 --> 01:13:56.957
And we wanna be left alone.
How difficult is that to understand?

01:13:57.460 --> 01:13:58.966
I apologise.

01:13:59.405 --> 01:14:02.150
If you want a fucking story,
you go talk to that kid's parents.

01:14:02.801 --> 01:14:05.487
Harass them! Ask them
how they raised a monster!

01:14:05.873 --> 01:14:08.363
They're the ones who did
something wrong, not us.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:09.767
<i>I'm sorry..</i>

01:14:21.375 --> 01:14:22.992
I want it to be over.

01:14:26.686 --> 01:14:28.040
I know.

01:14:29.235 --> 01:14:31.585
But it's never gonna be over!

01:14:33.064 --> 01:14:35.516
It's never gonna be over.

01:14:42.301 --> 01:14:44.600
You ever think the whole
thing doesn't make sense?

01:14:46.365 --> 01:14:48.923
I mean, they take all this
stuff away from you.

01:14:49.254 --> 01:14:51.342
Freedom, girls and sunshine.

01:14:51.666 --> 01:14:54.322
Because it's supposed to make it
so when you get back on the outs,

01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:56.590
you never wanna
screw up again.

01:14:57.914 --> 01:15:01.756
All it really does is get you to thinking
that you're so small, you know.

01:15:02.118 --> 01:15:04.654
Like you're this small thing
that doesn't matter for anything.

01:15:05.039 --> 01:15:07.008
By the time you do get out,

01:15:08.371 --> 01:15:11.056
you don't even feel like
a human person any more.

01:15:13.741 --> 01:15:17.319
Damn, devil boy,
they can't even make a lay-up out there.

01:15:27.035 --> 01:15:29.887
It's important to me
that she knows that I didn't know.

01:15:32.327 --> 01:15:34.658
Promise me you'll
tell her I didn't know.

01:15:35.884 --> 01:15:37.335
I promise.

01:15:41.499 --> 01:15:44.231
When you get a moment,
Elden wants to see you.

01:15:46.604 --> 01:15:47.897
Look...

01:15:50.781 --> 01:15:53.122
...I know I'm the
bastard here, OK?

01:15:53.466 --> 01:15:56.957
That's as close to an apology
as I'm gonna get, isn't it?

01:16:26.954 --> 01:16:28.069
Excuse me.

01:16:36.567 --> 01:16:39.573
Hey, that 2002 finally give
up the ghost on you?

01:16:42.377 --> 01:16:44.022
Empty it out.

01:16:44.404 --> 01:16:46.287
Empty out the cash register.

01:16:49.777 --> 01:16:53.253
- Empty it the fuck out, come on!
- Right, OK. Don't, OK?

01:16:53.584 --> 01:16:55.457
It takes a minute, OK?

01:16:55.893 --> 01:16:57.822
It's computer stuff, not me.

01:16:57.954 --> 01:16:59.902
- Hold on.
- Hey, hey!

01:17:00.293 --> 01:17:01.986
Don't move, OK?

01:17:02.287 --> 01:17:05.256
- Cool, man, cool. I ain't moving.
- OK, just don't move.

01:17:12.048 --> 01:17:14.616
- I don't have a bag.
- Hand it to me.

01:17:14.945 --> 01:17:16.681
Give it to me, come on!

01:17:17.146 --> 01:17:18.666
Thank you.

01:17:22.725 --> 01:17:24.302
What the fuck was that?

01:17:24.719 --> 01:17:27.825
This is bullshit, Elden.
This is red-tape bullshit and you know it.

01:17:28.105 --> 01:17:30.848
No, Madison, this is about you
running your own programme.

01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:34.217
You asked me about this kid,
I told you no. Then you, in effect, say,

01:17:34.522 --> 01:17:37.412
"Fuck you, I do whatever I want.
Elden Gilmore be damned. "

01:17:37.715 --> 01:17:40.733
- Look, this is about a kid who's so
screwed up... - No, this is about a book.

01:17:41.273 --> 01:17:43.585
And you wanna talk
about red-tape bullshit?

01:17:43.917 --> 01:17:45.752
Let's talk about how fast
I could have you fired

01:17:46.222 --> 01:17:48.635
for turning your classroom over
to non-certified personnel

01:17:48.957 --> 01:17:51.868
while you went off
to play your 20/20 bit with this kid.

01:17:52.261 --> 01:17:54.554
- Man, I am pulling you from SH.
- Wait a minute...

01:17:54.764 --> 01:17:58.319
After lunch, report to A Wing.
You're taking over Bellsey's class.

01:18:04.444 --> 01:18:07.357
Hey, Pearl, I was wondering
if you could do us a favour.

01:18:07.728 --> 01:18:10.922
I'm not really in a position where I
can be doing any favours right now.

01:18:11.420 --> 01:18:14.509
Cos I was just wondering if we
could get some time on the field,

01:18:14.891 --> 01:18:18.732
- to play basketball or something.
- They're pulling me from here.

01:18:19.204 --> 01:18:21.352
They're sending me
to another room.

01:18:21.897 --> 01:18:24.805
- But you'll be back tomorrow.
- No.

01:18:27.098 --> 01:18:28.231
Oh.

01:18:31.148 --> 01:18:33.315
I'm gonna miss our talks.

01:18:34.519 --> 01:18:36.598
You know, I'm gonna try
and get back in here if I can.

01:18:36.944 --> 01:18:38.544
I don't know if it'll
happen or not.

01:18:38.883 --> 01:18:42.463
- It's not my decision. It's not like...
- Let's go. Clean it up. Break's over.

01:18:42.877 --> 01:18:45.052
<i>I'm not bailing on
you or anything.</i>

01:18:47.808 --> 01:18:50.435
I didn't get to tell you everything
I wanted to tell you.

01:18:57.315 --> 01:18:59.667
I talk about New York at the end.

01:19:00.211 --> 01:19:01.980
You've finished writing?

01:19:02.869 --> 01:19:04.634
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:19:06.702 --> 01:19:08.574
<i>I want you to read it.</i>

01:19:10.603 --> 01:19:12.899
Maybe there's a why
in there somewhere.

01:19:14.016 --> 01:19:16.350
Maybe it'll make sense to you.

01:19:21.866 --> 01:19:25.406
Whether or not it makes sense to me,
it doesn't matter.

01:19:25.838 --> 01:19:29.092
Whatever happened, whatever you were
thinking, that's not the important thing.

01:19:29.459 --> 01:19:32.188
The most important thing right now
is what happens to you, Leland.

01:19:32.507 --> 01:19:34.792
Because you do control that,
to some extent.

01:19:35.476 --> 01:19:36.975
Listen to Charlie.

01:19:37.525 --> 01:19:41.770
Listen to your lawyer. Do whatever he tells
you to do. He does know what's best for you.

01:19:43.075 --> 01:19:46.902
What you did was wrong.
And I know you know that.

01:19:47.333 --> 01:19:51.598
I mean, you might not show it in the
right way, but I know you recognise it.

01:19:52.617 --> 01:19:55.096
You can't make it unhappen, but...

01:19:55.541 --> 01:19:57.373
...nobody ever can.

01:19:58.263 --> 01:20:03.460
Just because what you did was wrong doesn'
mean that giving up on your life is right.

01:20:04.473 --> 01:20:05.697
<i>Turn around!</i>

01:20:06.253 --> 01:20:08.264
<i>- Turn around!
- Stop right there!</i>

01:20:08.533 --> 01:20:11.003
<i>Go down to the Ground!
Slowly!</i>

01:20:19.045 --> 01:20:21.324
- What's going on?
- What is this? What is happening?

01:20:21.699 --> 01:20:24.237
- We're placing your son under arrest.
- He's not my son.

01:20:24.536 --> 01:20:25.880
Allen!

01:20:29.859 --> 01:20:31.251
Allen...

01:20:34.415 --> 01:20:36.718
- Allen...
- Allen, what is this?

01:20:37.148 --> 01:20:38.695
I'm sorry, Mrs Pollard.

01:20:39.245 --> 01:20:42.196
I just wanted to get out of town.
I made a mistake.

01:20:42.575 --> 01:20:44.428
<i>Don't say anything.
Don't say another word.</i>

01:20:44.761 --> 01:20:46.798
<i>We'll get you a lawyer,
sweetheart.</i>

01:20:52.318 --> 01:20:53.639
You ratted me out.

01:20:55.132 --> 01:20:57.640
You told my boss I was
writing a book about Leland.

01:20:58.064 --> 01:21:00.567
I said you were attempting
to write a book about Leland.

01:21:00.942 --> 01:21:03.217
Did you think I was gonna
allow you to exploit my son?

01:21:03.547 --> 01:21:05.555
No, I guess not.
That's your job, isn't it?

01:21:06.308 --> 01:21:07.632
Excuse me?

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:11.061
The only reason you're here
is because you smell a book.

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:14.030
Look, I don't need to prey on
a family tragedy for my material,

01:21:14.423 --> 01:21:16.003
you vulturous little hack.

01:21:16.277 --> 01:21:19.415
I could write 12 novels on the
light and shadow in this bar.

01:21:19.639 --> 01:21:22.717
That's what you're compiling your notes
about? The light and shadows in the bar?

01:21:24.484 --> 01:21:26.002
<i>I was trying to help him.</i>

01:21:26.411 --> 01:21:28.313
I'm the one here who actually
gives a fuck about your son.

01:21:28.589 --> 01:21:30.914
You've got no right to accuse me
of not caring for my son.

01:21:31.220 --> 01:21:33.159
If you cared about your son,
you'd have actually

01:21:33.536 --> 01:21:35.438
attempted to see him
over the past ten years,

01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:38.398
instead of paying to fly him
everywhere that you aren't.

01:21:38.523 --> 01:21:41.025
My relationship with Leland
is none of your concern.

01:21:41.395 --> 01:21:43.655
Apparently, it's none
of your concern, either.

01:21:44.714 --> 01:21:48.627
Look, I'm aware that I have made
mistakes in my life, Mr Madison.

01:21:48.974 --> 01:21:51.014
<i>I am fully aware of that fact.</i>

01:21:52.731 --> 01:21:55.416
<i>But I sure the fuck know
how to write my books.</i>

01:21:59.915 --> 01:22:01.140
You're pathetic.

01:22:01.603 --> 01:22:05.134
- That's why you'll never be a writer.
- No, that's why I'm not a bastard.

01:22:34.754 --> 01:22:36.548
Hey, can I come in?

01:22:49.391 --> 01:22:51.763
I just wanted to
see if you were OK.

01:22:55.157 --> 01:22:57.239
But I guess you're mad at me.

01:22:58.943 --> 01:23:01.049
But I didn't do anything wrong.

01:23:02.695 --> 01:23:04.117
I didn't...

01:23:05.755 --> 01:23:09.028
I didn't do anything wrong,
except make a lot of mistakes.

01:23:09.722 --> 01:23:11.302
And...

01:23:12.623 --> 01:23:14.477
I know that.

01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.918
And I'm sorry.

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:24.629
But I'm done.

01:23:26.039 --> 01:23:28.157
I'm done with all the mistakes.

01:23:31.988 --> 01:23:34.274
I'm going back to rehab.

01:23:34.850 --> 01:23:36.395
And...

01:23:36.893 --> 01:23:40.523
I'm gonna get clean this time,
because I wanna be clean.

01:23:45.383 --> 01:23:47.193
And I swear...

01:23:48.329 --> 01:23:51.171
I swear I didn't know
that Leland was gonna...

01:23:52.329 --> 01:23:54.106
...do anything.

01:23:57.005 --> 01:23:59.180
Just please tell me you don't...

01:23:59.552 --> 01:24:01.521
think that I knew because...

01:24:03.589 --> 01:24:06.794
...if you felt that, I would...
I'd wanna die.

01:24:07.138 --> 01:24:09.539
I'd wanna die if you
could even think that.

01:24:11.217 --> 01:24:13.775
You know how much I loved Ryan.

01:24:16.078 --> 01:24:18.459
You know how much I loved Ryan.

01:24:48.647 --> 01:24:49.756
Got it.

01:24:50.427 --> 01:24:51.632
Thanks.

01:24:55.161 --> 01:24:56.639
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:24:57.972 --> 01:25:00.433
<i>One main canal known
as the Grand Canal...</i>

01:25:00.732 --> 01:25:03.309
<i>For centuries, there was no bridge
over the Grand Canal...</i>

01:25:07.323 --> 01:25:08.589
How are you doing?

01:25:09.411 --> 01:25:11.608
- How are you doing?
- All right.

01:25:12.218 --> 01:25:13.778
So, did you escape the wrath?

01:25:14.242 --> 01:25:16.349
Gilmore owes me a couple still.

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:25.041
You er... got any desire
to burn those up?

01:25:28.119 --> 01:25:29.925
Goddamn you, man!

01:25:31.337 --> 01:25:33.827
- Hey, shoot, man!
- Shoot it, shoot it!

01:25:42.354 --> 01:25:45.324
When a guy hits three in a row,
you might wanna start guarding him.

01:25:57.050 --> 01:25:58.188
Miranda...

01:25:59.170 --> 01:26:03.012
I'm sorry. I'm not gonna
try and explain what I did.

01:26:03.043 --> 01:26:06.336
I know what I did was wrong and I'm
not gonna make excuses about it. I just...

01:26:06.734 --> 01:26:09.745
I just want you to know
that I'm really, really sorry.

01:26:10.145 --> 01:26:11.350
And...

01:26:12.117 --> 01:26:13.998
I wanna make this up to you.

01:26:15.109 --> 01:26:18.640
I do, I wanna make this up to
you so badly, I swear.

01:26:19.831 --> 01:26:22.468
I'm gonna get on the
plane and come out there.

01:26:23.315 --> 01:26:25.872
Because I wanna make
this right, you know.

01:26:26.317 --> 01:26:28.878
I wanna make this right
between us. Cos I...

01:26:29.663 --> 01:26:31.241
I love you.

01:26:32.123 --> 01:26:33.887
I love you very much.

01:26:44.717 --> 01:26:46.198
It's all for you.

01:26:55.178 --> 01:26:56.345
<i>Shit!</i>

01:27:18.430 --> 01:27:19.354
Hey, Allen.

01:27:22.317 --> 01:27:24.932
<i>I think there are two ways
you can see the world.</i>

01:27:26.217 --> 01:27:29.226
<i>You either see the sadness
that's behind everything</i>

01:27:30.205 --> 01:27:32.912
<i>or you choose
to keep it all out.</i>

01:27:36.475 --> 01:27:39.357
<i>I wasn't lying when I said,
"I don't blame her. "</i>

01:27:42.481 --> 01:27:45.032
<i>It was a couple of days
after all that stuff with Becky</i>

01:27:45.317 --> 01:27:48.130
<i>that I got the plane ticket
to New York from my dad.</i>

01:27:51.493 --> 01:27:53.856
<i>I was excited to
be back in the city,</i>

01:27:54.153 --> 01:27:56.415
<i>around Mrs Calderon, too.</i>

01:27:59.585 --> 01:28:03.320
<i>But as soon as I saw her.
I could tell something was different.</i>

01:28:03.957 --> 01:28:05.780
<i>She was divorced.</i>

01:28:06.225 --> 01:28:10.257
<i>It turns out Mr Calderon cheated on her
for almost the whole time they were married.</i>

01:28:15.480 --> 01:28:18.382
<i>That night, I told her
about what happened with Becky.</i>

01:28:21.186 --> 01:28:23.690
It happens at different
times for different people,

01:28:24.076 --> 01:28:26.665
but it happens to everybody.

01:28:28.665 --> 01:28:32.605
The worst part about growing up...
heartbreak.

01:28:33.064 --> 01:28:34.203
But...

01:28:34.722 --> 01:28:36.399
it's a part of life.

01:28:40.127 --> 01:28:42.448
It seems like a pretty big part.

01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:51.710
That's why you have to believe that life
is more than the sum of its parts, kiddo.

01:28:55.103 --> 01:28:59.032
<i>I kind of felt my heart breaking for her,
but I knew that was no good.</i>

01:28:59.838 --> 01:29:03.416
<i>I wanted to do something for her,
but there wasn't anything.</i>

01:29:04.684 --> 01:29:07.174
<i>There wasn't one thing
I could really do.</i>

01:29:09.322 --> 01:29:11.388
# Open the box

01:29:11.607 --> 01:29:13.511
# What is in there?

01:29:13.642 --> 01:29:17.075
# There are no tears
to be wasted

01:29:17.955 --> 01:29:20.062
# How can I climb

01:29:20.373 --> 01:29:22.352
# On a shoulder to cry?

01:29:22.738 --> 01:29:24.502
# If only this night

01:29:24.758 --> 01:29:29.287
# Could just take us away...

01:29:31.186 --> 01:29:33.684
<i>The electricity wasn't
in her eyes, any more.</i>

01:29:35.788 --> 01:29:40.043
<i>Her eyes were still reflecting what
was there, but now it was the sadness.</i>

01:29:42.525 --> 01:29:44.614
<i>I started to
see it everywhere.</i>

01:29:45.239 --> 01:29:47.780
<i>Every face was different,
but the same.</i>

01:29:53.530 --> 01:29:56.248
<i>I saw in Ryan
worse than anybody.</i>

01:29:58.717 --> 01:30:02.394
<i>All the words they were teaching him
were things to stay away from.</i>

01:30:02.938 --> 01:30:06.299
<i>There weren't any words
like "strawberry, or "kiss".</i>

01:30:10.092 --> 01:30:12.995
<i>You could tell he really liked
this girl who worked there,</i>

01:30:13.717 --> 01:30:15.749
<i>but she just smiled at him.</i>

01:30:19.798 --> 01:30:22.093
<i>I started to think that he knew.</i>

01:30:24.801 --> 01:30:27.725
<i>He knew that nobody looked
at him like a normal kid.</i>

01:30:28.134 --> 01:30:31.056
<i>People either laughed at him
or felt sorry for him.</i>

01:30:31.470 --> 01:30:33.549
<i>He couldn't do
anything about it.</i>

01:30:33.843 --> 01:30:35.489
<i>He was trapped.</i>

01:30:37.176 --> 01:30:40.924
<i>I couldn't sleep.
I hadn't slept since New York.</i>

01:30:41.305 --> 01:30:44.043
<i>I was lying there and I'd think about
Mrs Calderon and I'd think about Ryan</i>

01:30:44.437 --> 01:30:46.856
<i>and I felt things
tight in my chest.</i>

01:30:47.204 --> 01:30:49.085
<i>I felt like I was drowning.</i>

01:30:49.603 --> 01:30:52.283
<i>There's all this sadness and
there's nothing you can do about it</i>

01:30:52.502 --> 01:30:54.786
<i>and all I wanted
was for it to go away.</i>

01:30:56.957 --> 01:31:00.106
<i>When I say, "I don't remember that day",
I'm not lying.</i>

01:31:03.636 --> 01:31:06.094
<i>I wish I could remember,
but I don't.</i>

01:31:07.516 --> 01:31:09.123
<i>At least, not the
stuff they want me to.</i>

01:31:15.281 --> 01:31:17.113
<i>- Christ Jesus.
Oh. God.</i>

01:31:18.391 --> 01:31:20.008
<i>It's over.</i>

01:31:21.598 --> 01:31:23.196
It's over now.

01:31:31.485 --> 01:31:33.571
<i>Maybe it makes sense now.</i>

01:31:35.307 --> 01:31:38.101
<i>Maybe somewhere in all of this,
there is a reason.</i>

01:31:39.453 --> 01:31:42.131
<i>Maybe somewhere in all of this,
there is a why.</i>

01:31:43.230 --> 01:31:44.628
<i>Maybe somewhere
there's that thing</i>

01:31:44.719 --> 01:31:48.829
<i>that lets you tie it all up with a neat
bow and bury it in the back yard.</i>

01:31:51.398 --> 01:31:53.034
<i>But nothing.</i>

01:31:54.707 --> 01:31:58.939
<i>Not getting angry,
not prayers and not tears.</i>

01:31:59.636 --> 01:32:03.076
<i>Nothing can make something
that happened unhappen.</i>

01:32:10.324 --> 01:32:14.323
<i>- You know I'm sorry, don't you, Pearl?
- I do. I know you are.</i>

01:32:17.428 --> 01:32:21.222
It doesn't change anything.
I'm sorry.

01:32:34.534 --> 01:32:37.610
<i>The worst part is knowing
that there is goodness in people.</i>

01:32:38.390 --> 01:32:40.976
<i>Mostly, it stays deep
down and buried.</i>

01:32:43.637 --> 01:32:47.048
<i>And we don't have God because
we're scared of the bad stuff.</i>

01:32:47.455 --> 01:32:49.886
<i>Maybe we're really
scared of the good stuff.</i>

01:32:57.507 --> 01:32:59.419
<i>'Cos, if there's no God,</i>

01:32:59.798 --> 01:33:04.041
<i>that means it's inside of us and we
could be good all the time, if we wanted.</i>

01:33:04.605 --> 01:33:07.929
<i>So, when we do bad things,
it'd Be because we want to</i>

01:33:08.329 --> 01:33:10.271
<i>or because we have to.</i>

01:33:12.031 --> 01:33:14.403
<i>Or maybe we just need
the bad stuff to remind us</i>

01:33:14.719 --> 01:33:17.062
<i>what the good stuff is
in the first place.</i>

01:33:20.382 --> 01:33:22.382
What are you doing,
you goofball?

01:33:23.875 --> 01:33:25.628
<i>Just go around.</i>

01:33:33.937 --> 01:33:35.141
Uh...

01:33:41.726 --> 01:33:42.921
Come here.

01:33:43.871 --> 01:33:45.107
Come here.

01:33:46.891 --> 01:33:48.440
Come here.

01:33:54.156 --> 01:33:55.930
Everything's OK.

01:33:58.892 --> 01:34:01.068
Everything's gonna be OK.

01:34:03.991 --> 01:34:05.911
I promise.

01:34:15.302 --> 01:34:19.457
# Don't go racing

01:34:21.065 --> 01:34:24.839
# When you're on your own

01:34:26.662 --> 01:34:30.737
# Feet down and raining

01:34:32.376 --> 01:34:36.521
# See the jewel flow

01:34:38.049 --> 01:34:41.912
# Now that the years

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:47.105
# Seem like memories

01:34:47.421 --> 01:34:49.596
# Broken dreams

01:34:50.879 --> 01:34:55.190
# How can I turn back around

01:34:56.651 --> 01:35:01.620
# Slip back and
join in the crowd?

01:35:01.827 --> 01:35:05.029
# If I could love

01:35:05.471 --> 01:35:09.176
# you... now

01:35:12.348 --> 01:35:16.051
# Don't go racing

01:35:17.697 --> 01:35:21.831
# With the world in your head

01:35:23.531 --> 01:35:28.166
# There's no generation

01:35:29.411 --> 01:35:33.593
# Who

01:35:35.142 --> 01:35:38.984
# Now let the fear

01:35:39.390 --> 01:35:44.122
# Be memories

01:35:44.364 --> 01:35:47.234
# Broken dreams

01:35:48.010 --> 01:35:52.616
# How can you turn
back around

01:35:53.666 --> 01:35:58.516
# Slip back and join
in the crowd?

01:35:59.445 --> 01:36:04.337
# Forces keep pushing me down

01:36:05.002 --> 01:36:09.307
# Yet I would love you

01:36:10.374 --> 01:36:15.982
# If you could love
everyone around

01:36:17.506 --> 01:36:21.262
# If I could love you

01:36:52.596 --> 01:36:55.626
# Ballroom lips

01:36:56.730 --> 01:36:59.936
# On the way home

01:37:01.830 --> 01:37:06.236
# You made up my mind

01:37:08.344 --> 01:37:12.186
# And I

01:37:13.616 --> 01:37:16.734
# Well, I remained sort of sick

01:37:18.281 --> 01:37:22.045
# Now that I know

01:37:23.240 --> 01:37:28.874
# What was written in stone

01:37:31.727 --> 01:37:35.068
# Dooh dooh-dooh dah

01:37:35.764 --> 01:37:40.535
# Dooh-dooh dooh-dooh dah

01:37:41.282 --> 01:37:44.633
# Dooh dooh

01:38:02.758 --> 01:38:06.689
# Ballroom lips

01:38:06.996 --> 01:38:09.877
# Fell on the floor

01:38:11.887 --> 01:38:16.785
# You made up my mind

01:38:17.881 --> 01:38:22.754
# But I didn't die

01:38:23.706 --> 01:38:26.801
# Well, I remained sort of sick

01:38:28.172 --> 01:38:32.623
# Now that I know

01:38:33.415 --> 01:38:38.386
# What was written in stone

01:38:41.569 --> 01:38:45.647
# We used to talk about

01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:51.368
# If everything was right

01:38:52.348 --> 01:38:56.229
# The way we spent our time

01:38:56.554 --> 01:39:00.747
# It's hard to believe

01:39:02.051 --> 01:39:06.776
# Gloat on the design

01:39:07.412 --> 01:39:12.222
# Glory and laughter

01:39:12.850 --> 01:39:17.925
# Hold my entire world

01:39:18.277 --> 01:39:20.651
# Believe

01:39:34.466 --> 01:39:37.943
# Tumbling

01:39:38.601 --> 01:39:42.091
# Out in the yard

01:39:43.276 --> 01:39:47.479
# We were given some time...
