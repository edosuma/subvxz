BITSEY: Shit!

02:07.127 --> 02:08.595
BITSEY:
Stop, please!

02:27.939 --> 02:31.614
<i>TV REPORTER: In a related story, the
high court had also refused to stay</i>

02:31.693 --> 02:35.539
<i>Friday's execution of former
philosophy professor David Gale.</i>

02:35.739 --> 02:38.834
<i>Gale had sought a review
of his 1994 conviction</i>

02:38.909 --> 02:42.004
<i>for the rape and murder of his
University of Austin colleague,</i>

02:42.079 --> 02:43.501
<i>Constance Harraway.</i>

02:43.580 --> 02:46.174
<i>The case has received
nationwide media attention</i>

02:46.249 --> 02:49.879
<i>because Gale and Harraway
were activists for Death Watch,</i>

02:49.961 --> 02:52.259
<i>a nonprofit abolitionist
organization.</i>

02:52.339 --> 02:57.266
<i>Do you understand how much money taxpayers
pay in Texas to put one person to death?</i>

02:57.386 --> 03:00.139
<i>What do we want?
ALL: No more executions!</i>

03:00.263 --> 03:03.483
<i>DAVID: Governor, can't we all admit
the capital punishment system</i>

03:03.558 --> 03:04.980
<i>in this country is not working?</i>

03:05.060 --> 03:07.859
They're not going to stay Gale.
It's on TV right now. Listen.

03:07.938 --> 03:09.781
<i>Defense lawyers
had hoped to argue</i>

03:09.856 --> 03:12.735
<i>that Gale's former activism
against capital punishment</i>

03:12.818 --> 03:15.537
<i>unduly prejudiced
the Texas judicial system.</i>

03:15.612 --> 03:19.116
The deal was Bitsey would get the
interview if the stay was refused.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.327
He'll talk to her for
two hours a day,

03:21.410 --> 03:23.538
Tuesday, Wednesday
and Thursday.

03:24.079 --> 03:25.831
Can't do Friday. No.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.258
Friday's the day
they execute him.

03:29.835 --> 03:31.883
The lawyer said only Bitsey.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.635
Gale's going down.
Shh!

03:34.506 --> 03:36.600
Only Bitsey means only Bitsey.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.143
I don't get to
make the rules, Joe.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.765
Please, I'm a fat black woman.

03:39.845 --> 03:42.348
What we need is to put
her on a plane to Texas.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.558
Why do you get like
that around legal?

03:44.641 --> 03:46.689
Hold on, we're coming over.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.698
What's this "Only Bitsey
means only Bitsey" stuff?

03:51.773 --> 03:53.946
They asked for you,
and no substitutes.

03:54.025 --> 03:56.073
Who's they, exactly?
Gale's lawyers.

03:56.153 --> 03:59.783
More exactly, Gale's lawyer.
Some good old boy in Austin.

03:59.865 --> 04:01.082
Why do they want me?

04:01.158 --> 04:02.375
You don't want the assignment?

04:02.492 --> 04:03.744
I'm not saying that.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.171
I can't see why a guy
about to be executed

04:06.246 --> 04:07.623
should suddenly ask for me.

04:07.706 --> 04:10.960
Maybe they liked your kiddie
porn piece, and going to jail.

04:11.042 --> 04:13.511
Maybe he saw your picture
and thinks you're cute.

04:13.587 --> 04:15.260
So how much access do I get?

04:15.380 --> 04:17.007
Three interviews.
No time for more.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.808
By Friday, the guy's a goner.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.386
What exactly is our story?

04:21.511 --> 04:23.309
Rape, murder, death row.

04:23.680 --> 04:26.775
Very intelligent guy.
Maybe he's even innocent.

04:26.850 --> 04:28.227
Yeah, right.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.522
JOE: No, tell him I'll
call him back. Thanks.

04:31.855 --> 04:33.448
BARBARA: So what's
your problem?

04:33.523 --> 04:36.993
JOE: Hi, Barbara. Morning, Bitsey.
Okay, here's my concern.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.782
Setting aside the cost issue,

04:38.862 --> 04:42.116
although $500,000 in cash
for three days of interviews

04:42.199 --> 04:44.167
is not only illegal,
it's obscene.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.995
That's market value.
The guy's never talked.

04:47.078 --> 04:50.628
Aside from that, I, we are still
uncomfortable with the arrangement.

04:50.957 --> 04:51.958
Why?

04:52.042 --> 04:54.636
You just spent a very
public seven days in jail

04:54.711 --> 04:56.964
for a very public
contempt-of-court citation.

04:57.047 --> 05:00.551
For protecting sources. If you
were uncomfortable with the story,

05:00.634 --> 05:03.353
why did you slap it on the
domestic and international covers?

05:03.428 --> 05:07.478
What makes us uncomfortable
is that a rapist/murderer

05:07.557 --> 05:09.901
has asked to spend the last
three days of his life

05:09.976 --> 05:12.274
giving an interview,
his very first,

05:12.354 --> 05:13.947
to a reporter who is now famous

05:14.064 --> 05:15.657
for protecting sexual deviants.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.406
A reporter who is also
a very attractive woman.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.112
This is disparate treatment.

05:20.237 --> 05:21.830
JOE: Oh, boy.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.657
I could go if I
were an ugly guy?

05:23.740 --> 05:27.040
The agenda issue would be diffused
with the presence of a male.

05:27.118 --> 05:29.496
I hear lawyers
gleefully saying,

05:29.621 --> 05:31.999
"Bloom versus
<i>News Magazine</i> Inc."

05:32.082 --> 05:34.631
"Your Honor, I started
to notice my assignments

05:34.709 --> 05:36.962
"were being determined
on the basis of my sex."

05:37.045 --> 05:38.672
You've got to let her go now.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.007
That's not what I meant.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.428
He's got to let you go.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.602
All right. Enough.

05:43.677 --> 05:46.351
But the intern will be
with you at all times.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.147
What? Intern.

05:48.265 --> 05:50.814
No, you've got to be kidding.
That's what he said.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.519
He's a jerk.
He's the boss.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.650
Not an intern.
I always work alone.

05:54.729 --> 05:55.855
Not this time, Bitsey.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.316
I'm not baby-sitting.

06:13.790 --> 06:17.169
BITSEY: Gale's DNA was everywhere.
His semen was inside her.

06:17.252 --> 06:18.845
He was seen leaving her house.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.890
His prints were all over the
kitchen, including one on the bag.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.387
Half a thumbprint.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.976
Half a thumbprint.
That's enough.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.520
He could've touched it before
it was a murder weapon.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.564
You fondle your
friends' garbage bags?

06:29.639 --> 06:32.188
Yeah, I get very touchy
around household plastics.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.235
I'm particularly
fond of Tupperware.

06:34.311 --> 06:35.528
Tupperware?

06:35.604 --> 06:39.825
I'm just saying the bag could've
been sitting on the counter.

06:40.984 --> 06:43.578
He did it. Now he's going to die.
And you know something?

06:43.653 --> 06:45.621
Maybe that's exactly
what he deserves.

06:45.697 --> 06:47.745
But the murder's way
too fucking clumsy.

06:47.824 --> 06:52.000
This guy is an intellectual. Top of
his Harvard class, Rhodes Scholar,

06:52.078 --> 06:54.752
tenured at 27,
two books published.

06:54.831 --> 06:56.504
He's an academic stud.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.174
Look at his wife.
A regular Grace Kelly.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.802
Old money svelte. Father
was ambassador to Spain.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.849
Shit! The light's on again.

07:04.966 --> 07:06.843
Ignore it, it's a rental.

07:07.218 --> 07:08.845
Do you smell anything?

07:08.970 --> 07:10.597
The guy's a flaming Liberal.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.432
A person's politics
has nothing to do

07:12.515 --> 07:13.607
with his tendency
to commit crime.

07:13.725 --> 07:14.772
Wrong.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.774
Shouldn't it smell
if it's overheating?

07:16.853 --> 07:19.777
Seventy-three percent of all
serial killers vote Republican.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.234
Throw your cigarette out,
so we can smell.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.117
You'll stink up the car.
Throw it out.

07:26.196 --> 07:27.994
I'm not going to
fucking pollute.

07:43.838 --> 07:46.557
BITSEY: There's definitely
something wrong with this car.

07:46.633 --> 07:47.976
This is so irritating.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.473
How far to Huntsville?

07:49.552 --> 07:51.429
BITSEY: I'm going to pull off.

07:52.222 --> 07:55.101

"just their car

08:25.797 --> 08:28.050
Jesus, yes!
Isn't it always?

What do I do?

08:30.760 --> 08:33.764
Call the office and get the

No signal.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.131
Zack!

09:08.214 --> 09:09.466
Yeah?

09:58.598 --> 10:00.145
Morning.
Hi.

10:03.353 --> 10:05.321
A little early
for that, isn't it?

10:05.897 --> 10:08.070
The nonsmoking
section's over there.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.114
I meant the book.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.954
<i>Dialogical Exhaustion</i>
by David Gale.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.290
The guy's a genius.

What time is it?

10:17.158 --> 10:18.205
9:15 a.m.

10:19.035 --> 10:20.833
There are 10
prisons around here.

10:20.954 --> 10:22.706
Death row is in the Ellis unit,

10:22.789 --> 10:25.963
but they're moving it to the Terrell
unit at the end of the year.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.794
The waitress's
boyfriend works there.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.130
Her last boyfriend worked
in the Huntsville unit.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.056
The two before that in Walker.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.305
The Estelle unit
has the cutest guys.

10:34.384 --> 10:38.434
And I'm quoting, "My butt's too
big to get an Estelle guy."

10:40.723 --> 10:42.316
Ellis is 15 minutes
out of town.

10:42.433 --> 10:44.060
We've got five
and a half hours.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.239
Never eat in a place where the
menus have pictures of the food.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.238
We should drive into Austin.
Check out the crime scene.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.910
That could be some
great stuff for our story.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.581
This isn't our story. It's not even
a story. It's an interview.

10:57.532 --> 11:00.911
Most importantly for you to
remember, it's my interview.

11:02.579 --> 11:05.002
What do I do for
the next five hours?

11:05.081 --> 11:07.630
Drive around. Look for
a decent restaurant.

11:10.211 --> 11:13.090
Your reputation as
Mike Wallace with PMS

11:13.173 --> 11:14.675
doesn't do you justice.

11:15.049 --> 11:16.847
My reputation got
us invited here.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.679
I play by the rules, even if
my colleagues don't like it.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.355
It's called...
Ambition?

11:21.431 --> 11:22.432
Objectivity.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.767
What can I get you, ma'am?

11:23.892 --> 11:25.109
Just coffee.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.199
Don't push me, smart ass.

11:46.956 --> 11:48.629
You know you're

churches than Starbucks.

GROVER: Yes, I am.

13:20.967 --> 13:25.313
I'm not gonna debate with you the
rights and wrongs of the situation.

Our job is to run the

This is not France. This is not
Germany. This is Texas.

follow Texas law.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.544
He's usually real
good with names.

13:55.626 --> 13:58.220
And these days I
always like to ask

13:58.296 --> 14:00.674
do you prefer Miss,
Mrs., or Ms.?

14:01.257 --> 14:02.383
Bitsey.

14:02.508 --> 14:03.555
Bitsey it is.

You ever been in a prison?
Yes.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.316
On death row?
No.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.230
ID's again, please.

14:12.310 --> 14:16.406
All executions in the state of Texas
occur at the Huntsville unit.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.984
But death row is here
for the time being.

14:19.067 --> 14:22.742
This is home to all 442
offenders prior to their date.

14:23.112 --> 14:25.331
Average stay on
the row is nine years.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.205
Some get commuted, but
most get put to death.

14:29.369 --> 14:32.464
It'll put you off your supper,
but then, it's supposed to.

14:33.164 --> 14:34.757
GROVER: New York
guests for Mr. Gale.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.467
Can I get your bags?

14:36.542 --> 14:40.422

safety, safety, and safety.

14:40.505 --> 14:42.599
The visitation area
is entirely secure.

14:42.673 --> 14:44.846
We just ask that you
don't touch the glass.

14:44.926 --> 14:46.678
Windex gets expensive.

No, sir.

14:57.522 --> 14:58.562
ZACK: They're not working.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.904
Then you won't mind
leaving them here.

15:00.983 --> 15:04.487
We also have rules against the
carrying of large sums of cash

15:04.570 --> 15:06.743
and the wearing
of open-toed shoes.

15:07.990 --> 15:11.085
Those will do just fine. You
want to step on through now?

15:11.577 --> 15:12.794
There you go.

Open-toed shoes?

15:18.251 --> 15:19.343
Drives them crazy.

15:19.669 --> 15:22.422
GROVER: Your turn, Mr. Stemmons.
Right on through there.

15:22.672 --> 15:23.673
Good.

15:24.549 --> 15:27.553
Should anything unpleasant
occur in the visitation area,

15:27.635 --> 15:29.262
we ask you to stay put.

15:29.345 --> 15:32.565
Please follow the instructions of
our fine correctional officers

15:32.640 --> 15:34.813
should they see fit
to give you any.

15:35.643 --> 15:38.317
Anything you say
can be overheard.

15:38.396 --> 15:42.651
Any discussion of criminal activity
on your part is admissible.

15:42.733 --> 15:45.532
You're not planning on
a jailbreak, are you?

15:45.903 --> 15:48.497
The rain seems
to be holding off.

15:48.573 --> 15:52.203
You watch your step here. This
cement can get pretty slippery.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.545
This is our Japanese garden.

15:54.996 --> 15:57.875
We ask you not to
throw coins in the pond.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.882
Right this way.
Almost there.

16:03.713 --> 16:07.263
Here we are. This is our
visitation area right here.

16:08.426 --> 16:10.394
All yours, Mr. Belyeu.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.690
That's it for me. You
folks have a safe visit.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.771
Thank you.
Bye now.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.397
Ms. Bloom?
BITSEY: Yes.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.063
Come right on in here and
make yourself comfortable.

16:20.146 --> 16:22.444
Did that PR man
validate your parking?

16:22.523 --> 16:24.651
He said the gift
shop would do it.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.614
She's a smart one.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.913
Braxton Belyeu,
Mr. Gale's attorney.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.160
This is Zack Stemmons.

16:30.281 --> 16:31.453
My good pleasure.

16:31.782 --> 16:34.581
And right over here,
we have the man of the hour.

16:44.295 --> 16:45.387
Hello.

16:45.963 --> 16:47.089
Hello.
Hi.

16:47.465 --> 16:50.264
<i>GUARD (OVER P.A.): Sit down, Gale.
Prisoner will not stand.</i>

16:50.343 --> 16:52.562
Why can't they
turn that thing down?

16:53.262 --> 16:55.185
My lawyer respectfully requests

16:55.264 --> 16:58.108
that you adjust the volume
on the speaker system.

16:58.184 --> 17:01.063
<i>GUARD (OVER P.A.):
Gale, sit down.</i>

17:05.650 --> 17:07.903
They're practicing
being cruel and unusual.

17:09.819 --> 17:12.448
I'm sure you're
biting at the bit.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.375
It is our understanding
that you are

17:14.492 --> 17:16.290
to have three
two-hour sessions.

17:16.618 --> 17:18.872
Today, tomorrow, and Thursday.

17:18.954 --> 17:20.957
All at 3:00 p.m.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.047
I'm sorry we can't
afford you more time.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.756
But contrary to popular rumor,
we have not yet begun to fight.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.058
It is our understanding
that you will do this alone.

17:31.133 --> 17:33.227
The magazine would prefer that...
Alone.

17:33.302 --> 17:34.394
Understood.

17:34.470 --> 17:39.397
BELYEU: Also, you'll use no
recording equipment of any kind.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.193
BITSEY: Correct.
BELYEU: Excellent.

17:41.269 --> 17:44.364
I have a few papers for which
I need your Jo Anne Hancock.

17:44.438 --> 17:48.784
So if you'd stop by my Austin office
at your earliest convenience.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.486
Thursday morning, say?

17:50.736 --> 17:52.329
Expenses and so forth.

17:55.658 --> 17:58.332
Fine. Till Thursday, then.
Good luck.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.171
I'll stop by later.

18:02.748 --> 18:06.298
What say you and me partake
of a death-defying cigarette

18:06.377 --> 18:08.254
in the visitors' parking lot?

18:08.337 --> 18:09.429
Bye-bye, y'all.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.015
So...

18:19.765 --> 18:21.642
Please pull up a seat.

18:28.357 --> 18:29.449
He's quite a character.

18:29.525 --> 18:30.526
Yes.

18:30.610 --> 18:33.284
He's about the only outside
contact I have now.

18:33.362 --> 18:34.739
And a good friend.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.791
Where's your ex-wife?

18:37.867 --> 18:41.087
I don't want you to ask me
questions about her or my son.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.464
What I offer you is one thing.

18:43.539 --> 18:46.133
Questions about them
are not part of our deal.

18:46.208 --> 18:47.209
Okay.

18:48.085 --> 18:50.964
Just say, "Off the record,"
and I'll take it to my grave.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.594
You can trust me on that.

18:53.758 --> 18:55.977
Does this count as
recording equipment?

18:59.722 --> 19:00.894
How do we start?

19:01.015 --> 19:02.187
We start with

19:03.601 --> 19:05.774
you telling me
what I'm doing here.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.865
No one who looks through
that glass sees a person.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.317
They see a crime.

19:12.276 --> 19:15.496
I'm not David Gale.
I'm a murderer and a rapist.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.744
Four days shy of his execution.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.827
You're here because I
want to be remembered

19:21.911 --> 19:25.131
as much for howl led my life
and the decisions that I made

19:25.206 --> 19:27.254
as for how my life ended.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.634
Why me?

19:29.752 --> 19:30.924
Why not?

19:31.003 --> 19:33.597
You've spent some time behind
bars yourself recently.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.141
I certainly have.

19:35.216 --> 19:37.594
Because you do take
things to your grave.

19:38.260 --> 19:42.015
Protecting sources, even kiddie
porn scum, is the magazine policy

19:42.098 --> 19:43.771
and mine.
I know.

19:44.767 --> 19:46.394
That's your reputation.

19:48.604 --> 19:51.278
I have a hard story for
you to tell, Miss Bloom.

19:52.483 --> 19:54.235
It's not going to be easy.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.156
Where do we begin?

20:00.783 --> 20:03.377
DAVID: I should tell you how
I became Head of Philosophy

20:03.452 --> 20:05.170
<i>at the University of Austin.</i>

20:11.627 --> 20:13.345
<i>DAVID: Come on, think.</i>

20:13.421 --> 20:15.924
<i>I want you to reach
back into those minds.</i>

20:16.006 --> 20:17.349
<i>And tell me, tell us all,</i>

20:18.134 --> 20:21.138
what is it that
you fantasize about?

20:22.138 --> 20:23.310
World peace?

20:24.056 --> 20:25.148
Thought so.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.603
Do you fantasize about
international fame?

20:28.686 --> 20:30.654
(WHOOPING AND CHEERING)

20:31.021 --> 20:34.571
Do you fantasize about
winning a Pulitzer Prize?

20:34.650 --> 20:37.073
Or a Nobel Peace Prize?

20:37.153 --> 20:39.121
An MTV Music Award?

20:39.196 --> 20:40.448
(LAUGHING)

20:40.531 --> 20:44.161
Do you fantasize about
meeting some genius hunk

20:44.243 --> 20:48.248
ostensibly bad, but secretly
simmering with noble passion

20:48.330 --> 20:50.674
and willing to sleep
on the wet spot?

20:51.667 --> 20:53.419
KIMBERLEY: I'll take two!
What was that?

20:53.502 --> 20:54.674
I'll take two!

20:54.837 --> 20:56.009
Kimberley will take two.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.515
You get Lacan's point.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.270
Fantasies have
to be unrealistic.

21:02.344 --> 21:05.598
Because the moment, the second
that you get what you seek,

21:05.681 --> 21:08.400
you don't,
you can't want it anymore.

21:08.476 --> 21:10.945
In order to continue to exist,

21:11.020 --> 21:15.070
desire must have its objects
perpetually absent.

21:15.149 --> 21:19.029
It's not the "it" that you want,
it's the fantasy of "it."

21:20.154 --> 21:23.704
Desire supports
crazy fantasies.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.330
(DOOR SLAMS OPEN)

21:25.409 --> 21:26.456
Sorry.

21:31.290 --> 21:35.261
This is what Pascal means when he
says that we are only truly happy

21:35.961 --> 21:38.805
when daydreaming
about future happiness.

21:38.881 --> 21:39.928
(WHISPERING)
It came today.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.760
DAVID: Or why we say, "The hunt
is sweeter than the kill."

21:42.843 --> 21:44.686
Or, "Be careful
what you wish for."

21:44.762 --> 21:46.639
Not because you'll get it,

21:46.722 --> 21:49.726
because you're doomed
not to want it once you do.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.311
So the lesson of Lacan is

21:52.394 --> 21:54.988
living by your wants
will never make you happy.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.907
What it means to be fully human

21:56.982 --> 21:59.826
is to strive to live
by ideas and ideals.

21:59.902 --> 22:01.996
Not to measure your life

22:02.071 --> 22:05.245
by what you've attained
in terms of your desires

22:06.075 --> 22:10.581
but those moments of integrity,
compassion, rationality,

22:11.372 --> 22:13.170
even self-sacrifice.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.717
Because in the end,

22:14.792 --> 22:18.547
the only way we can measure the
significance of our own lives

22:18.629 --> 22:21.098
is by valuing
the lives of others.

(SCHOOL BELL RINGS)

All right,
I'll see you all on Monday.

22:50.578 --> 22:52.205
Sorry about being late.

22:53.497 --> 22:55.420
There was, you know, a thing.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.632
There usually is, Berlin.

22:59.962 --> 23:02.181
I know that I'm
not doing too well.

23:03.924 --> 23:07.224
And to torture a cliché,

23:09.638 --> 23:11.481
I would do anything to pass.

23:16.645 --> 23:17.737
Anything?

23:18.939 --> 23:22.409
Anything.

23:25.613 --> 23:26.865
Okay, Berlin.

23:31.911 --> 23:36.132
I will give you
a very good grade

Listen to this gem.

"Journalist,
'Governor, don't you think

24:01.357 --> 24:03.530
"'three executions in

"Governor, 'I say bring 'em in, strap
'em down, and let's rock and roll."'

24:07.863 --> 24:10.958
It's good that our governor's in
touch with his inner frat boy.

Will you tell me why you're
not doing this debate?

24:13.285 --> 24:15.083

You have a cuter butt.

24:15.162 --> 24:16.835
I hadn't noticed.
I know.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.837
I didn't mean that.

24:18.916 --> 24:20.418

"An eye for an eye" and all.

Stick to arguments about rational
facts and watch your ego.

everyone here wears big hats,

"and nobody in charge
reads The New Yorker."

Anything else?

24:44.566 --> 24:46.568
I'm getting new stats
from Amnesty tonight.

mark your calendar yet?

25:20.853 --> 25:24.073
Only four more days?
That's great news.

25:24.982 --> 25:28.236
Can I ask you something?
It's really important.

25:28.318 --> 25:29.740
Of course you can.

25:29.820 --> 25:32.243
Can we have
pancakes for breakfast?

25:34.408 --> 25:37.127
With syrup and strawberries?

25:37.202 --> 25:38.749
We'll have to see.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.373
And chocolate shavers?

25:41.331 --> 25:43.959
No, it's chocolate shavings.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.632
And whipped cream?

25:45.753 --> 25:46.879
Whipped cream?

25:47.212 --> 25:49.761
That's a lot of requests
for one little boy.

Why don't you go to sleep?

Do Cloud Dog, too.

25:53.761 --> 25:55.479
Good night, Cloud Dog.

26:07.149 --> 26:08.742
Okay.

26:11.653 --> 26:13.530
I'll be back before midnight.

Here's the number if
you have to reach me.

There's chicken in the

Yes, I did.

Someone wake me up.

27:00.744 --> 27:02.041

Where's your better half?

My wife?
She's in Spain.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.794
Again? I am sorry.

27:08.877 --> 27:11.630
John, have you seen Alma?
She's been looking for you.

27:11.713 --> 27:14.557
My wife's affair is just
this big, open secret.

The only fun truths are the
ones someone's trying to hide.

She's been to Barcelona
four times this year.

trying to hide anything.

Yeah, except the
embassy's in Madrid.

By the way, Berlin's here.

27:31.441 --> 27:33.193
Pretty livid.
Why?

27:33.277 --> 27:35.746
We've expelled her.
She got the letter today.

27:35.821 --> 27:38.324
Took the opportunity to
throw a fit in my office.

anything but rape.

and leaves town,

traumatized to face trial.

finger at authority.

a postcard from San Francisco.

who would do anything."

40:04.235 --> 40:05.987

girl from the university.

On the whole rap.

40:30.094 --> 40:33.439
Who knows? Anyway, there is
no truth, only perspectives.

40:33.514 --> 40:35.312
If you say there's no truth,

40:35.391 --> 40:37.143
you're claiming it's

is as good as a conviction.

40:44.192 --> 40:45.614
It sticks like shit.

40:45.693 --> 40:47.036
That's an appetizing metaphor.

40:47.111 --> 40:48.408
Technically a simile.

40:48.488 --> 40:50.240
I think he's telling the truth.

40:50.323 --> 40:52.371
This you know from sitting
in the prison lobby?

40:52.450 --> 40:53.952
It's just my perspective.

40:54.035 --> 40:56.629
Three different
courts found him guilty.

40:56.704 --> 40:59.127
That's enough
perspective for me.

This is Zack Stemmons.

42:08.985 --> 42:10.407
You want the tour?

42:11.988 --> 42:14.958
There's a $20 mandatory
donation apiece.

42:15.283 --> 42:18.628
You get a re-enactment photo packet.
It's got five pictures.

42:18.828 --> 42:20.876
Okay.
I got to collect first.

42:20.955 --> 42:21.956
Sure.

42:22.915 --> 42:24.007
I got it.

42:27.795 --> 42:30.890
Got to sign the book. It doesn't
have to be your real name.

42:30.965 --> 42:33.809
It says you're here to do
research on violent crime.

My boyfriend took it.

42:47.940 --> 42:49.692
We also got a video.

They never found a camera, or
photos, a video or anything.

a serial killer.

She was totally naked,
right here.

The meter man saw
her through the door.

43:51.879 --> 43:54.257
Gale handcuffed her,
taped her mouth,

43:54.340 --> 43:56.889
then taped a bag over her
head so she couldn't breathe.

43:56.968 --> 43:59.892
He used housewife gloves
so he wouldn't leave prints.

43:59.971 --> 44:02.645
They found sticky stuff
from the tape on them.

44:02.723 --> 44:05.727
We ask folks not to
touch the exhibit.

44:06.894 --> 44:10.148
The totally sick part is where they
found the key to the handcuffs.

44:12.066 --> 44:13.033
We know.

44:13.109 --> 44:14.861
Wait. What?
Where was it?

44:15.194 --> 44:17.162
It was in her stomach, dude.

44:17.238 --> 44:19.866
Gale made her swallow it
before he bagged her.

44:20.575 --> 44:22.748
That's pretty
much the highlights.

Weird coincidence?

45:02.700 --> 45:06.295

That's why they're coincidences.

45:14.879 --> 45:16.301
Okay. We're off.

45:18.507 --> 45:21.977
Constance was murdered by what's
known as the Securitat Method.

45:22.637 --> 45:25.060
You're handcuffed,
forced to swallow the key,

45:25.139 --> 45:27.688
your mouth is taped, a bag
is sealed around your head,

45:27.767 --> 45:29.269
and you're left to suffocate.

45:29.352 --> 45:31.070
The Securitat
did it to Romanians

45:31.145 --> 45:32.863
when they wouldn't
inform or confess.

45:32.939 --> 45:36.034
Sometimes the bag was ripped off
to give you a second chance.

45:36.108 --> 45:37.655
Otherwise, you died

45:37.735 --> 45:39.658
knowing that the
key to your freedom

45:39.820 --> 45:41.788
was inside of you
the entire time.

45:42.198 --> 45:44.326
It's a cheap but
effective method.

45:44.825 --> 45:46.042
The problem is

45:49.997 --> 45:52.671
I once mentioned it in
an article that I wrote.

45:55.253 --> 45:57.051
Prosecution never knew that.

45:59.006 --> 46:00.349
Someone's framing you?

46:00.508 --> 46:01.805
It's more than that.

46:03.636 --> 46:05.104
There was a tripod.

Right.

Facing her body.

46:09.725 --> 46:11.773
Are we back on the record?
Yes.

46:12.395 --> 46:15.114
The tripod had no
fingerprints on it.

46:15.189 --> 46:18.489
That means somebody brought
it there, set it up,

46:18.567 --> 46:20.820
wiped it clean, and left it.

46:21.737 --> 46:22.989
Why?

46:23.072 --> 46:26.497
It's as if they wanted me to
know that somewhere out there

46:26.575 --> 46:29.545
is a record of exactly what
happened that afternoon.

46:29.620 --> 46:31.338
As if they wanted me to die

46:31.414 --> 46:34.714
knowing that the key to my
freedom is out there somewhere.

46:37.461 --> 46:39.680
Maybe you're being paranoid.

46:39.755 --> 46:43.134
I used to be the state's leading
death penalty abolitionist.

46:43.217 --> 46:46.642
Now I'm on death row! Doesn't
that strike you as a little odd?

46:48.556 --> 46:50.274
Any idea who "they" are?

46:51.684 --> 46:54.403
No, but I've got
someone working on that.

46:55.521 --> 46:58.149
Someone I'm relying on
to prove my innocence.

46:58.232 --> 46:59.950

47:01.319 --> 47:02.571

47:03.738 --> 47:05.240

47:09.618 --> 47:10.915
You know I'm innocent.

No.

47:15.916 --> 47:16.917
No, I don't.

47:29.096 --> 47:31.144

47:32.016 --> 47:33.609

survived a trial separation?

47:43.819 --> 47:46.538

of trying to work things out?

want you out of here.

51:50.816 --> 51:52.568
Look, Professor Gale,

51:52.651 --> 51:54.870
I could sit here
like others have,

51:54.987 --> 51:57.206
and plead
departmental cutbacks,

51:57.656 --> 52:00.876
claim you need more publications,
I need a minority.

Hell, it's not even

It would be nice to have a faculty
member whose crutch wasn't Prozac.

But to speak plain,
if I were to hire you,

52:27.728 --> 52:30.151
in the eyes of the
regents, the alumni,

52:30.230 --> 52:33.154
and every freshman
with an ear for gossip,

52:33.233 --> 52:35.156
I'd be hiring a rapist.

52:35.527 --> 52:37.495
Those charges were dropped.

52:37.571 --> 52:39.949
People would say
you had a good lawyer.

52:40.908 --> 52:42.251
I was innocent.

52:43.118 --> 52:44.586
You don't get it, do you?

52:44.662 --> 52:47.256
You're not politically correct.

Welcome to the club.

DAVID: Socrates is
sentenced to death.

52:57.424 --> 53:00.348
I bet you didn't know that.
He was sentenced to death.

53:00.427 --> 53:04.398
But Athenian law
let the condemned

53:04.473 --> 53:07.022
come up with their own
alternate punishment.

53:07.601 --> 53:09.103
Isn't that a great idea?

53:09.186 --> 53:12.030
Where are the Athenians
when you really need them?

53:13.691 --> 53:15.739
So anyway, Socrates...

53:15.818 --> 53:17.786
And he was ugly.
Did I mention that?

53:17.861 --> 53:20.956
Did I mention that
Socrates was ugly?

53:21.031 --> 53:23.284
Socrates was ugly,
Plato was fat,

53:23.409 --> 53:25.628
and Aristotle was
a prissy dresser.

53:27.246 --> 53:30.841
So anyway, Socrates comes
up with this idea.

53:30.916 --> 53:35.137
He says, "What if I pay
a fine instead of death?"

53:35.212 --> 53:36.930
He suggests a fine.

53:37.005 --> 53:39.099
All he has to do
in order to live is

53:39.216 --> 53:41.218
to come up with
an appropriately

53:41.301 --> 53:42.894
punitive figure.

53:45.097 --> 53:48.067
Guess what he
suggested? $30!

53:52.187 --> 53:54.986
Does that make
any sense? $30.

53:55.065 --> 53:57.488
That's 30 mina. That was the
currency of the day, a mina.

53:57.568 --> 53:59.366
Well, minae.

53:59.445 --> 54:00.947
That's plural. Minae.

54:02.239 --> 54:03.286
$30!

54:04.199 --> 54:05.917
Thirty pieces of silver.

54:06.702 --> 54:10.673
And the judges are so pissed that
more of them voted to kill him

54:10.748 --> 54:12.625
than had voted him
guilty in the first place.

54:12.708 --> 54:14.585
That doesn't make any sense.

54:15.586 --> 54:17.259
Thirty pieces of silver.

54:18.005 --> 54:19.552
Just like the Judas guy.

you'll never see him again.

He's got to come back.

56:39.605 --> 56:42.324
tell me three
personal qualities

56:42.399 --> 56:44.242
that you feel you have

56:44.318 --> 56:46.946
that would make you a
successful Radio Shed manager.

56:49.031 --> 56:50.078
Three.

56:53.911 --> 56:54.912
Okay.

57:16.308 --> 57:18.060
(DOORBELL RINGS)

57:37.496 --> 57:38.622
I'm sorry.

57:42.376 --> 57:44.344
I'm sorry. Welcome back.

57:44.419 --> 57:45.420
Thanks.

57:46.213 --> 57:48.056
You look good.
I feel good.

57:49.883 --> 57:52.181
There's something
that you've got to see.

57:52.719 --> 57:54.596
Betty Sue Johnson
has been rescheduled.

57:54.680 --> 57:56.523
Her execution date
is set for the eighth.

57:56.598 --> 57:58.646
I have a call with
Washington tonight.

57:58.725 --> 58:01.069
If the national director
commits to emergency funds...

58:01.144 --> 58:03.317
She gets commuted and you
prove the system works.

58:03.397 --> 58:05.650
But I'll save a life.

58:05.732 --> 58:07.826
Where did you get that bruise?

58:07.901 --> 58:10.199
Just doing chores.

58:10.278 --> 58:12.701
Is your cowboy
getting rough with you?

58:16.576 --> 58:17.953
DAVID: There he is.

58:18.036 --> 58:21.415
Dusty, does she ever invite you
over and not put you to work?

58:25.419 --> 58:27.592
All right, tell me her story.

58:27.671 --> 58:29.844
She was sentenced at 17.

58:29.923 --> 58:32.893
I really want to get behind this one.
She's so articulate.

58:32.968 --> 58:34.015
Who did she kill?

58:34.094 --> 58:35.846
She'll put a face
on the death penalty.

58:35.929 --> 58:38.227
Constance, who did she kill?

58:39.057 --> 58:40.058
A cop.

58:40.767 --> 58:41.893
You're crazy.

58:41.977 --> 58:45.197
Not just your medium-range, thinks-
she's-Roosevelt's-bath robe,

58:45.272 --> 58:49.277
but I mean stark-raving,
screws-loose, in-the-belfry insane!

58:49.359 --> 58:50.906
Seventeen.

58:51.486 --> 58:53.955
Four years before she could
legally drink a beer.

58:54.031 --> 58:55.999
But she killed a cop, Constance.

58:56.074 --> 58:58.076
Will you help?
Of course.

58:59.953 --> 59:01.330
You're burning up.

59:13.800 --> 59:14.892
Hi, Mr. Gale.

59:14.968 --> 59:16.970
How are you?
It's good to see...

59:29.441 --> 59:31.443
Caffeine jolt.
We deliver.

59:31.526 --> 59:32.823
Howdy, David.
Howdy, folks.

59:32.903 --> 59:36.248
Hello. My, this is service.
Thank you.

59:36.323 --> 59:38.621
Gladly. Latte on the left
there for you, John.

59:38.700 --> 59:40.168
Mocha.
Thanks.

59:41.161 --> 59:43.129
She's on the phone to Washington.

59:43.246 --> 59:45.248
Sinclair, new National Director.

59:48.335 --> 59:50.963
I'm sure we can get some
pulpit time, maybe some cable.

59:51.088 --> 59:53.056
<i>DIRECTOR (ON SPEAKERPHONE):
Cable's good. Listen, I need to run.</i>

59:53.131 --> 59:54.929
<i>I agree the first press release</i>

59:55.008 --> 59:56.851
<i>should focus on
the woman's youth.</i>

59:56.927 --> 59:59.271
<i>I'll have Washington
look into counsel competency.</i>

59:59.346 --> 01:00:02.316
<i>Though I'm almost sure she's
exhausted this on appeal.</i>

01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:04.734
<i>See what resources...
David's going to go.</i>

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:07.313
<i>I almost forgot.
Gale's not around, is he?</i>

01:00:08.438 --> 01:00:09.610
No.

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:10.948
<i>Good. Keep it that way.</i>

01:00:11.024 --> 01:00:13.573
<i>His relationship
with Death Watch is over.</i>

01:00:13.652 --> 01:00:16.701
<i>Last thing we need is this rape
thing coming back to bite us.</i>

01:00:16.780 --> 01:00:18.908
<i>These guys don't stay
on the wagon for long.</i>

01:00:19.533 --> 01:00:21.001
<i>I'm serious, Constance.</i>

01:00:21.076 --> 01:00:24.125
<i>Ban him from the premises.
I realize the two of you...</i>

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:32.678
David!

01:00:49.938 --> 01:00:53.818
DAVID: Sharon, pick up the phone.
I'm begging you.

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.447
He's my son, all right?

01:00:55.527 --> 01:00:57.950
He's my son, too,
and I want to talk to him.

01:00:58.029 --> 01:01:00.157
You've not let... Hello?

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.493
Jamie, is that you?

01:01:02.576 --> 01:01:05.204
Hey, little moose horn.

01:01:05.996 --> 01:01:07.919
I miss you so much.
It's Daddy.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:14.137
Jamie, wait.
Don't hang up the phone!

01:01:15.714 --> 01:01:16.840
God damn it!

01:01:26.474 --> 01:01:27.771
Fuck!

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:17.237
(DAVID COUGHS)

01:02:18.318 --> 01:02:19.615
You scared me.

01:02:20.111 --> 01:02:21.829
My sheep needs a manager.

01:02:22.739 --> 01:02:23.911
A manger.

01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:25.788
My sheep needs a manger.

01:02:27.202 --> 01:02:28.704
Are you okay?

01:02:31.373 --> 01:02:33.717
I fell off the wagon,
and I hurt myself.

01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:37.257
Come on inside.

01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:47.014
Do you know why St. Jude is the
patron saint of lost causes?

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:49.350
'Cause his real name was Judas.

01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:53.104
Judas! There were
two Judases.

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:57.032
Judae, who was the saint
guy, and then the other one,

01:02:57.732 --> 01:02:59.780
Judas, who was the bad one.

01:02:59.859 --> 01:03:03.864
He's the one who ratted out
Jesus and tried to kiss him.

01:03:03.947 --> 01:03:06.621
In medieval times, they would
never pray to the good Judas

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:09.874
for fear of getting the bad Judas
on the line just by mistake.

01:03:09.953 --> 01:03:12.752
Ergo, they never
really gave him business

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:14.708
unless absolutely desperate.

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:19.296
That's why. And then
they changed his name.

01:03:19.963 --> 01:03:21.761
Your mail is blowing.

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:35.478
Shit.

01:03:41.109 --> 01:03:44.113
Are you the doctor?
What's wrong with her?

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:45.162
She'll be fine.

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:47.206
How do you know?
Calm down.

01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:50.832
She was opening her mail and fell over.
I don't know what's wrong.

01:03:50.910 --> 01:03:52.378
Please.
Is there a doctor?

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:53.963
Wait here.

01:03:54.039 --> 01:03:55.165
I have to go with her!

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:56.382
Hold up, Professor!

01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:58.677
You want to get arrested again?

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.638
How do you know who I am?

01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:04.933
I watch the news.
Now go wait.

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:43.717
How're we doing?
Fine. How's Constance?

01:04:43.797 --> 01:04:44.798
Sleeping.

01:04:46.091 --> 01:04:47.764
A leukemia patient's
condition is

01:04:47.842 --> 01:04:49.435
very susceptible to
external stress...

01:04:49.511 --> 01:04:50.512
What?

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:55.479
Constance's illness requires
a degree of regularity.

01:04:58.812 --> 01:05:00.485
Constance has leukemia?

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:03.776
You didn't know?

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:07.495
Wait.

01:05:12.117 --> 01:05:13.334
No, I didn't.

01:05:22.794 --> 01:05:25.297
It's funny how selfish
we can be, isn't it?

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:31.804
When I first heard Constance was
dying, I was so mad at her.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:35.895
I thought, "How can
you do this to me?

01:05:35.974 --> 01:05:39.274
"I mean, you know how hard it is
for me to need other people."

01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:43.865
Why hadn't she told you?

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:47.702
She said she was too busy.

01:05:50.655 --> 01:05:52.749
I guess since
death was chasing her,

01:05:52.824 --> 01:05:54.918
she wanted to help
other people avoid it.

01:05:59.914 --> 01:06:02.042
That's what she
did with her life.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:10.093
Constance left this world a
better place than she found it.

01:06:13.595 --> 01:06:16.724
It's a small but difficult thing.

01:06:58.598 --> 01:07:01.943
Let's go.
So, what'd you get?

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:05.022
I talked to the Austin prosecutor.
Belyeu's a joke.

01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:08.608
Actually, the exact phrase he
used was, "Big hat, no cattle."

01:07:08.733 --> 01:07:10.451
He was sanctioned twice.
What?

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:12.370
Seriously fucked up
the penalty phase.

01:07:12.445 --> 01:07:15.073
He could have got life
on mitigating factors.

01:07:15.156 --> 01:07:17.033
Despite major pro bono offers

01:07:17.116 --> 01:07:18.868
from some of the top
lawyers in the country,

01:07:18.952 --> 01:07:20.579
Gale stuck with him all through

01:07:20.703 --> 01:07:22.296
the appeals process,
which by the way,

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:24.625
Belyeu continued to screw up.

01:07:24.707 --> 01:07:27.836
So, Belyeu's a joke.
Great.

01:07:30.088 --> 01:07:32.216
BITSEY: Anything else?
Nothing on Berlin.

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:34.721
We pick up the payola money
in Houston tonight.

01:07:34.801 --> 01:07:36.144
Houston?

01:07:36.261 --> 01:07:37.582
That's what the head office said.

01:07:37.637 --> 01:07:39.059
Overheat light came on twice...

01:07:39.180 --> 01:07:40.602
Come on.

01:08:07.625 --> 01:08:10.799
Oh, man, I never knew $1
million could weigh so much.

01:08:10.878 --> 01:08:12.175
$500,000.

01:08:12.297 --> 01:08:13.514
It's still heavy.

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:15.763
But $1 million sounds
better for our...

01:08:15.842 --> 01:08:18.265
Excuse me, your story.
$1 million.

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:20.345
No, wait.
$1 million in cash.

01:08:20.470 --> 01:08:22.439
Just relax, Zack.
It's only money.

01:08:31.107 --> 01:08:32.734
So you coming in?

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:35.911
Excuse me?

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.740
You want to come in?

01:08:40.283 --> 01:08:41.283
Please.

01:08:41.618 --> 01:08:44.246
What? I thought you were
into guys with money.

01:08:48.207 --> 01:08:49.332
Zack?

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:50.964
ZACK: What?
It's open.

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:54.220
Well, maybe the maid forgot.

01:08:56.549 --> 01:08:57.550
Look.

01:09:05.224 --> 01:09:06.897
We got to call somebody.

01:09:10.395 --> 01:09:11.397
Wait.

01:09:23.701 --> 01:09:25.578
What is that?
I don't know.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:43.688
(WHISPERING):
This is not good.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:09:59.783
I'm gonna check the bathroom.

01:09:59.946 --> 01:10:01.118
No, Bitsey.

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:02.574
Wait there.

01:10:41.654 --> 01:10:43.156
Bitsey!
What?

01:10:43.823 --> 01:10:45.040
Zack, there could
have been prints.

01:10:45.158 --> 01:10:46.375
Look.

01:11:04.927 --> 01:11:07.055
The lady at reception says
no one asked for you.

01:11:07.138 --> 01:11:09.937
All the keys are different. She
and her husband have masters.

01:11:10.016 --> 01:11:11.188
What'd you tell her?

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:12.522
You have a jealous boyfriend.

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:13.694
How about the VCR?

01:11:13.853 --> 01:11:14.945
She didn't ask.

01:11:15.021 --> 01:11:17.991
I think she assumed it had something
to do with why he was jealous.

01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:19.942
You sure we shouldn't
call the cops?

01:11:20.026 --> 01:11:21.949
Whoever got in
here without a key

01:11:22.028 --> 01:11:23.701
in broad daylight,
was smart enough

01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.249
not to leave prints.
I have the remote. Here.

01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.828
You sure you want to
see what's on here?

01:11:31.996 --> 01:11:33.088
Try three.

01:11:35.041 --> 01:11:37.339
I hope this isn't
what I think it is.

01:11:44.258 --> 01:11:45.475
Oh, my God.

01:11:49.138 --> 01:11:50.185
Is it her?

01:11:50.306 --> 01:11:51.398
That's her.

01:12:42.942 --> 01:12:46.116
Belyeu said to bring the
tape first thing tomorrow.

01:12:47.530 --> 01:12:51.160
He also said you were right
about not calling the police.

01:12:56.622 --> 01:12:58.624
You gonna be all right?

01:13:24.150 --> 01:13:25.402
He deserves it
though, probably.

01:13:25.484 --> 01:13:27.327
There's a lot of sick
people in this world,

01:13:27.403 --> 01:13:29.155
and if they done
wrong and found guilty...

01:13:29.238 --> 01:13:31.832
All right, let's just say
Gale's telling the truth.

01:13:31.908 --> 01:13:33.956
Maybe some right-wing
fuck set him up,

01:13:34.035 --> 01:13:35.412
arranged the perfect murder.

01:13:35.494 --> 01:13:37.713
Why would you send a
magazine journalist proof

01:13:37.788 --> 01:13:39.085
a few hours before you'd won?

01:13:39.165 --> 01:13:40.667
It does not make sense.

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:42.335
No, it's perfect.

01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:46.301
Whoever this is knows how hard
it is to get a retrial in Texas.

01:13:46.380 --> 01:13:48.257
They know the magazine
can't give this

01:13:48.341 --> 01:13:50.264
any substantial play
before the execution.

01:13:50.343 --> 01:13:54.098
We'd have to give it to a daily or
a network. That won't happen.

01:13:54.180 --> 01:13:57.354
But mostly, they know
I'll tell Gale today.

01:13:58.225 --> 01:13:59.226
So?

01:14:00.895 --> 01:14:04.195
What if Constance's murder was
just a means of getting at Gale?

01:14:04.273 --> 01:14:07.322
Not only to get rid of him, but
to make abolitionists look crazy.

01:14:07.401 --> 01:14:10.780
Of course, he sympathizes
with murderers. He is one.

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:13.082
They make sure he sits
six years on death row

01:14:13.157 --> 01:14:15.785
for a brutal rape and murder,
then they let him die.

01:14:15.868 --> 01:14:18.587
Die knowing everyone will
remember him with disgust.

01:14:18.663 --> 01:14:22.509
They destroy his life, his work,
his memory. And they make him watch.

01:14:24.585 --> 01:14:26.132
That's a lot of hate.

01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:29.848
Well, then why release it?

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:31.642
Hate's no fun if you
keep it to yourself.

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:51.779
BITSEY: We got company.

01:14:51.904 --> 01:14:52.905
Who? The cowboy?

01:14:54.573 --> 01:14:56.917
BITSEY: And doing
a lousy job of hiding.

01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:59.378
He must think we're idiots.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:00.917
BITSEY: Is he gaining?

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:02.715
No. He's just
sitting back there.

01:15:02.832 --> 01:15:04.584
Get a license plate number.

01:15:09.422 --> 01:15:10.594
God, I'm sorry.

01:15:10.756 --> 01:15:11.928
He's turned off.

01:15:12.883 --> 01:15:14.601
BITSEY:
What does this guy want?

01:15:18.681 --> 01:15:21.685
BELYEU: Fine. Bobbi, could you make
a quick copy of that videotape

01:15:21.767 --> 01:15:24.691
and bring in Miss Bloom's
original when that's done?

01:15:26.105 --> 01:15:28.358
I don't blame you for
not watching that twice.

01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:29.613
I couldn't sleep afterwards.

01:15:29.734 --> 01:15:30.826
I understand.

01:15:30.901 --> 01:15:33.495
I tell folks I'm no more
afraid of the Grim Reaper

01:15:33.571 --> 01:15:35.949
than I am of a Presbyterian
on Mother's Day.

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:40.253
But watching that tape,
I had to keep telling myself,

01:15:40.327 --> 01:15:42.750
"That's not Constance,"
just to get through.

01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:45.333
Unfortunately,
others may argue the same.

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:49.212
But it's in her kitchen.
In her house.

01:15:49.295 --> 01:15:52.515
But currently home to
Weirdoes Incorporated.

01:15:52.590 --> 01:15:55.594
Arguably, that tape could've
been made by anybody with $20

01:15:55.676 --> 01:15:57.553
and a tolerance for vulgarity.

01:15:57.636 --> 01:15:58.836
Will it get us a postponement?

01:15:58.888 --> 01:16:00.060
Us?

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:04.985
This ain't my first rodeo,
Miss Bloom.

01:16:05.061 --> 01:16:07.860
Now, I got to tell you that
there's a machine a-running.

01:16:07.938 --> 01:16:09.690
And come tomorrow
night at 6:00,

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:11.567
that machine gonna
want to be fed.

01:16:11.650 --> 01:16:12.993
All here, Mr. Belyeu.

01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:14.453
BELYEU:
Thank you, Aaron.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:17.414
Now, to add to our troubles,
your own credibility

01:16:17.490 --> 01:16:18.582
may come into question.

01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:19.624
Why?

01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:21.873
You've been fraternizing
with the condemned.

01:16:21.952 --> 01:16:23.750
I've been what?
In the court's eyes,

01:16:23.829 --> 01:16:26.582
he's the most likely candidate
to have put you onto that tape.

01:16:26.665 --> 01:16:29.464
He's a persuasive man. You're
an out-of-state woman.

01:16:29.543 --> 01:16:30.920
That don't look good.

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:34.132
Mr. Belyeu, someone put
the tape in my room.

01:16:34.215 --> 01:16:36.468
BELYEU: That's a fact for which
we have no evidence.

01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:37.676
Thank you, Bobbi.

01:16:37.802 --> 01:16:38.849
Thanks.

01:16:40.012 --> 01:16:43.437
Let's not throw a pity party
and sit around reading Kafka.

01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:45.814
Could be we find
a sympathetic judge.

01:16:46.519 --> 01:16:48.271
Now, I'll file within the hour.

01:16:48.354 --> 01:16:50.106
You going to see Gale?
Yeah.

01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:51.907
Fine. I'll give you
a call over to

01:16:52.024 --> 01:16:53.776
the motel later with an update.

01:17:08.207 --> 01:17:10.005
My coat.
Shoot.

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:30.779
What?
You saw him?

01:17:30.855 --> 01:17:31.902
Who?
The cowboy.

01:17:31.981 --> 01:17:32.982
He was here?

01:17:33.065 --> 01:17:35.818
He's in the lobby! See if his
truck's out front. Tail him.

01:17:35.901 --> 01:17:37.653
Get a license number.
Find out who he is.

01:17:37.736 --> 01:17:39.488
Don't screw it.
It's important.

01:17:39.572 --> 01:17:40.744
But how will you
get to the prison?

01:17:40.906 --> 01:17:42.078
Taxi.

01:18:27.661 --> 01:18:28.662
Fuck!

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.377
You're not being straight.

01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:36.383
I walk out of Belyeu's office,
the guy's in the lobby!

01:18:36.462 --> 01:18:38.055
Maybe you should calm down.

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:40.303
GUARD (OVER P.A.):
<i>Visitor needs to stay seated.</i>

01:18:42.051 --> 01:18:43.803
Maybe you should sit down.

01:18:50.309 --> 01:18:52.061
His name is Dusty Wright.

01:18:52.144 --> 01:18:54.943
He's the local deathwatch
director before Constance.

01:18:55.022 --> 01:18:57.116
He's a bullhorner.

01:18:57.191 --> 01:18:58.443
He's a zealot who thinks

01:18:58.525 --> 01:19:01.995
that a good demonstration has
to end with riots and arrests.

01:19:02.988 --> 01:19:05.787
Deathwatch fired him because
he punched someone at a rally.

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:08.460
But Constance kept
him in the organization.

01:19:08.535 --> 01:19:12.585
He adored her. They were close.
Real close.

01:19:14.458 --> 01:19:16.085
He testified at my trial.

01:19:16.502 --> 01:19:19.847
Testified to support you, or
to oppose the death penalty?

01:19:20.756 --> 01:19:22.178
He testified against me.

01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:23.721
Against you?

01:19:23.801 --> 01:19:26.020
He testified
about the drinking.

01:19:26.095 --> 01:19:28.848
Alcohol is a mitigating
factor in capital cases.

01:19:29.974 --> 01:19:31.942
I always told
myself that he did it

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:35.738
in some sick way to try to help
me get a reduced sentence.

01:19:36.939 --> 01:19:39.033
I guess he believes
I really killed her.

01:19:39.692 --> 01:19:42.070
Dusty's a man easily
blinded by hatred.

01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:47.576
Maybe he hated you because
you were seeing Constance.

01:19:47.658 --> 01:19:49.376
I wasn't seeing Constance.

01:19:49.493 --> 01:19:51.166
She had your semen inside her.

01:19:51.245 --> 01:19:54.374

more complicated than that.

to your meeting today?

01:22:05.003 --> 01:22:08.883
Yeah. But I think I have to
find one less guru-like.

Did you take your medicine?

01:22:15.389 --> 01:22:16.561

01:22:33.449 --> 01:22:36.373
Anger. Denial.

01:22:37.828 --> 01:22:39.296

be seen as a sex object.

01:30:03.815 --> 01:30:06.489
But what do we
really know about death?

01:30:06.568 --> 01:30:08.366
Just that nobody comes back.

01:30:10.238 --> 01:30:12.457
But there comes
a point in life,

01:30:13.325 --> 01:30:14.622
a moment,

01:30:15.827 --> 01:30:19.001
when your mind
outlives its desires,

01:30:20.290 --> 01:30:21.883
its obsessions.

01:30:23.418 --> 01:30:25.170
When your habits

01:30:26.421 --> 01:30:28.344
survive your dreams.

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:34.180
And when your losses...

01:30:40.435 --> 01:30:42.108
Maybe death is a gift.

01:30:44.856 --> 01:30:46.028
You wonder.

01:30:46.191 --> 01:30:47.317
GUARD: That's it.

01:30:47.859 --> 01:30:48.985
Let's go, Gale.

01:30:54.157 --> 01:30:58.162
All I can tell you is that by
this time tomorrow, I'll be dead.

01:30:59.245 --> 01:31:00.747
I know when.

01:31:02.207 --> 01:31:03.925
I just can't say why.

01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:08.713
You have 24 hours to find out.

01:31:15.053 --> 01:31:16.305
Goodbye, Bitsey.

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:14.033
Miss Bloom?
Yeah.

01:32:16.114 --> 01:32:18.708
Thought I'd return your coat.
It's getting kind of chilly.

01:32:18.783 --> 01:32:20.751
Any news from our
video intruder friend?

01:32:20.827 --> 01:32:22.875
No. Any word on the appeal?

01:32:22.954 --> 01:32:25.958
Denied. Tape went to a
federal judge two hours ago.

01:32:26.583 --> 01:32:29.052
Now what you got was
definitely a snippet.

01:32:29.127 --> 01:32:31.129
Could be your
video supplier friend

01:32:31.296 --> 01:32:33.264
has more nasty
previews scheduled.

01:32:33.339 --> 01:32:36.058
Best you not get into too
much sightseeing right now.

01:32:36.134 --> 01:32:38.353
Just stick close
to your motel room.

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:44.225
How's David?
He's holding up.

01:32:44.309 --> 01:32:46.437
Gonna be a hard night.

01:32:46.519 --> 01:32:48.738
Will you tell him
I'll take care of it?

01:32:48.813 --> 01:32:50.360
About his son, I mean.

01:32:50.482 --> 01:32:52.075
I'll do that.

01:32:52.150 --> 01:32:54.323
You staying for the execution?

01:32:55.612 --> 01:32:58.161
Then I'll see you tomorrow.
Watch yourselves.

01:33:02.911 --> 01:33:05.255
Were Dusty Wright
and Constance close?

01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:07.674
Yeah. Thick as thieves,
those two.

01:33:08.625 --> 01:33:09.751
Lovers?

01:33:09.876 --> 01:33:11.002
Whoa, now.

01:33:11.086 --> 01:33:13.464
You're plowing a little
too close to the cotton.

01:33:13.546 --> 01:33:15.799
That was just a rumor.
Nothing more.

01:33:16.257 --> 01:33:17.258
Night-night.

01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:23.119
Wake up! Did you throw
the towel on the floor?

01:36:23.236 --> 01:36:25.580
What? This towel was
on my bathroom floor.

01:36:25.655 --> 01:36:27.032
Did you throw it there?

01:36:27.156 --> 01:36:28.533
I guess. What?
It's a motel.

01:36:28.574 --> 01:36:30.622
Would you do that at home?
No.

01:36:30.702 --> 01:36:33.455
It's not like we're staying
in the frigging Four Seasons.

01:36:33.538 --> 01:36:36.587
Come on, get the TV.
We're taking it with us.

01:36:36.666 --> 01:36:39.670
What are you talking about?
Where are we going?

01:36:39.752 --> 01:36:41.174
Austin. Get the TV.

01:36:41.296 --> 01:36:42.718
All right.

01:36:47.593 --> 01:36:48.594
Hold on.

01:37:11.617 --> 01:37:12.743
Want to make $100?

01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:14.002
NICO: What do I got to do?

01:37:14.078 --> 01:37:16.172
BITSEY: We're going
over the crime scene.

01:37:16.873 --> 01:37:18.750
Put the TV on the bed, Zack.

01:37:22.086 --> 01:37:25.511
Now, for the next hour, I want
you to do exactly what I say

01:37:25.590 --> 01:37:28.594
when I say to do it. If I
say, "Jump," you jump.

01:37:28.676 --> 01:37:30.519
You want me to jump?
A figure of speech.

01:37:30.595 --> 01:37:32.268
Your boyfriend
put the tripod back.

01:37:32.388 --> 01:37:33.935
He's not my boyfriend anymore.

01:37:34.057 --> 01:37:35.855
Still have the video camera?
Yes.

01:37:35.933 --> 01:37:37.901
Good. Get it. I got
to collect first.

01:37:37.977 --> 01:37:39.729
Zack, give her the money.

01:37:47.779 --> 01:37:49.998
Can you move that stuff
off the counter for me?

01:37:50.073 --> 01:37:52.792
By the lamp.
Yeah, thanks.

01:37:59.207 --> 01:38:00.754
Put the gloves
on the dish rack.

01:38:00.875 --> 01:38:02.377
I don't have a dish rack.

01:38:02.919 --> 01:38:04.466
BITSEY: Zack, could you...

01:38:10.218 --> 01:38:11.765
Turn them inside out.

01:38:15.264 --> 01:38:17.437
BITSEY:
Put the duct tape on the floor.

01:38:18.851 --> 01:38:20.103
By the stove.

01:38:25.983 --> 01:38:27.906
Could you...
What's your name?

01:38:27.985 --> 01:38:29.407
Nico's fine.

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:34.000
Nico, I want you to lie
down facing the counter.

01:38:35.368 --> 01:38:37.120
We can imagine that part.

01:38:42.834 --> 01:38:43.960
Zack, put her in position.

01:38:44.085 --> 01:38:45.211
Okay.

01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:51.009
Move this way.

01:38:51.092 --> 01:38:52.890
All right.
BITSEY: Now forward.

01:38:53.553 --> 01:38:56.181
There. Okay. On her side.

01:38:57.181 --> 01:39:00.230
Right. Her top leg
out a little.

01:39:01.686 --> 01:39:02.778
BITSEY: There.

01:39:06.732 --> 01:39:08.109
Now look at this.

01:39:12.864 --> 01:39:14.741
She moves her foot.

01:39:14.824 --> 01:39:16.918
I noticed this
back at the motel.

01:39:17.702 --> 01:39:20.046
She moves her foot.
Quite deliberately.

01:39:20.830 --> 01:39:22.332
And then she's still.

01:39:22.415 --> 01:39:25.259
For another 15
seconds she's still.

01:39:25.334 --> 01:39:27.177
And then she
starts to struggle.

01:39:27.253 --> 01:39:29.631
That doesn't make sense.
If this was a murder,

01:39:29.714 --> 01:39:33.184
she'd just be struggling and then
she'd be still. She'd be dead.

01:39:33.259 --> 01:39:36.229
Maybe she was faking.
Hoping he'd go away.

01:39:38.598 --> 01:39:39.599
Or...

01:39:43.478 --> 01:39:45.355
We've got to bag her.

01:39:45.480 --> 01:39:47.357
We're going a bit too far here.

01:39:55.448 --> 01:39:56.825
I'll do it.

01:40:05.374 --> 01:40:06.876

stand over by the tripod.

Wait three minutes before
you take the bag off.

01:40:37.114 --> 01:40:39.492
I'm not sure about this.
It's too dangerous.

01:40:39.575 --> 01:40:42.203
Three full minutes. Stand
over there with her.

01:42:00.197 --> 01:42:01.369
Are you okay?

01:42:01.532 --> 01:42:02.704
She did it herself.

01:42:32.521 --> 01:42:35.946
She used the gloves to keep her
fingerprints off the tape and bag.

01:42:36.025 --> 01:42:38.323
Then she put them
back on the dish rack.

01:42:38.402 --> 01:42:41.531
But upside down and inside out.
A housewives' habit.

01:42:41.614 --> 01:42:43.787
A murderer would've
tossed them aside

01:42:43.866 --> 01:42:45.994
like you do with
a towel in a crap motel.

01:42:46.077 --> 01:42:47.670
All right, maybe.

01:42:49.246 --> 01:42:51.294
But why wear these?

01:42:51.415 --> 01:42:53.509
They threw me.
But she needed them.

01:42:53.584 --> 01:42:56.588
She knew she would instinctively
try to rip the bag off.

01:42:56.671 --> 01:42:59.174
And she swallowed the key
so she couldn't get to it.

01:42:59.256 --> 01:43:01.850
She made sure
there was no way out.

01:43:01.926 --> 01:43:05.351
Why not hang yourself or take pills?
Why take your clothes off?

01:43:05.429 --> 01:43:07.181
Why make it look like a murder?

01:43:07.306 --> 01:43:09.104
I don't know.
It's so calculated.

01:43:09.975 --> 01:43:11.727
She's handcuffed,
taped at the mouth.

01:43:11.811 --> 01:43:13.609
BITSEY: The gloves.
The damn tripod.

01:43:14.063 --> 01:43:16.782
Why fake your own murder?
It doesn't make sense.

01:43:16.857 --> 01:43:19.110
The woman's a
bleeding-heart abolitionist.

01:43:19.193 --> 01:43:20.285
Why frame an innocent man?

01:43:20.361 --> 01:43:21.521
Why send Gale to the chair...

01:43:21.529 --> 01:43:22.576
What?

01:43:22.655 --> 01:43:25.750
She had to know some innocent
jerk would take the fall.

01:43:26.701 --> 01:43:28.078
Oh, my God, Zack.

01:43:29.537 --> 01:43:30.629
That's it.

01:43:31.622 --> 01:43:34.125
That's why!
To prove it happens!

01:43:34.208 --> 01:43:37.007
To have absolute proof that the
system convicts innocents.

01:43:37.086 --> 01:43:38.133
Get out of here!

No.

01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:40.723
That's how she thought.

01:43:40.798 --> 01:43:43.551
Think about it! This woman
lived for deathwatch!

01:43:43.634 --> 01:43:46.729
If she's gonna die anyway,
why not die for it?

01:43:46.804 --> 01:43:48.647
That's why the tripod was here.

01:43:48.764 --> 01:43:50.562
To record proof.
Undeniable proof!

01:43:50.641 --> 01:43:52.234
That's why we got the video!

A dead woman put
the tape in your room?

01:43:54.061 --> 01:43:56.484
No, of course not.
I mean, she needed help.

01:43:56.564 --> 01:43:59.238
Someone to keep it, release it.

01:43:59.316 --> 01:44:02.991

Someone she could trust.

What a dump.
The guy's a freak.

01:45:10.971 --> 01:45:12.348
Dusty's a bullhorner.

01:45:12.431 --> 01:45:14.809
A zealot who's OD'd
on too many good causes.

01:45:14.892 --> 01:45:17.486
You know, the original plan
was probably for Dusty

01:45:17.561 --> 01:45:20.155
to release the tape
after Gale's conviction.

01:45:20.231 --> 01:45:22.199
You know, after a year or so.

01:45:22.274 --> 01:45:25.619
It'd force him to dry out,
give him back his dignity.

01:45:25.694 --> 01:45:28.914
So Dusty Wright is sitting
on this tape, waiting.

01:45:29.448 --> 01:45:31.997
And he's the only
one who knows about it.

01:45:32.076 --> 01:45:35.000
So Dusty starts to think
that an erroneous execution

01:45:35.079 --> 01:45:37.832
is a lot more politically
useful than a last-minute save.

01:45:37.915 --> 01:45:41.089
Because a last-minute save would
only prove the system works.

01:45:41.168 --> 01:45:43.842
Almost-martyrs don't count.

01:45:43.921 --> 01:45:48.142
Dusty's thinking, "What's one
murder if it stops thousands?"

01:45:49.301 --> 01:45:52.555
So, he'll release the whole
tape only after the execution.

01:45:56.141 --> 01:45:58.894
Which means he must have
the original somewhere.

01:45:59.770 --> 01:46:00.896
