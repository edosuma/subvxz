00:14.512 --> 00:16.934
<i>This house, this plantation...</i>

00:17.007 --> 00:19.909
<i>this whole damned parish
belonged to my family...</i>

00:19.983 --> 00:23.780
<i>before your people stepped aboard
the stinkin'cattle boat...</i>

00:23.856 --> 00:25.743
<i>that brought 'em to this country.</i>

00:25.808 --> 00:28.077
<i>Don't you dare
talk back to me, boy.!</i>

00:28.144 --> 00:30.216
<i>My family's seen this state...</i>

00:30.287 --> 00:32.491
<i>crawlin'with
lousy carpetbaggers...</i>

00:32.558 --> 00:35.210
<i>that knew more about
behaving like a gentleman than you do.</i>

00:35.280 --> 00:38.149
<i>I can't even look at Charlotte...</i>

00:38.223 --> 00:41.801
<i>without ugly thoughts
rip my guts.</i>

00:41.871 --> 00:47.141
<i>I'd sooner it'd been
one of my field boys.</i>

00:47.215 --> 00:49.288
I could've killed him.

00:52.015 --> 00:55.943
Do you know what it's costin' me
not to kill you?

00:59.791 --> 01:04.428
My daughter and
Jewel Mayhew's husband.

01:05.903 --> 01:09.798
You gutless, soft,
sucklin' swine!

01:17.616 --> 01:21.260
My daddy sat out there
on that veranda.

01:22.895 --> 01:27.052
Let this whole place
slide to dust.

01:27.120 --> 01:31.626
When he died, there was nothin'
but debts and dirt.

01:33.680 --> 01:38.349
I touched that dirt
and made it blossom.

01:38.415 --> 01:42.474
I fought to keep this house
and to bring it back up.

01:44.975 --> 01:48.074
<i>I don't have a son to give it to.</i>

01:48.143 --> 01:50.052
Only Charlotte...

01:53.359 --> 01:56.840
and she ain't gonna
give it to you.

01:56.912 --> 02:00.588
You ain't gonna have
my home or my child.

02:00.656 --> 02:04.300
I created both,
and I'm gonna keep 'em.

02:04.367 --> 02:08.906
I ain't watched
over my girl all these years...

02:08.975 --> 02:10.949
to have some...

02:11.024 --> 02:12.879
to have someone...

02:12.944 --> 02:16.489
to have some creature
like you take her away.

02:16.559 --> 02:18.664
Listen, I'm gonna
tell you somethin'.

02:18.735 --> 02:20.590
Your daughter ain't
a little girl anymore...

02:20.655 --> 02:23.438
and there's gonna be
other men in her life besides you.

02:37.263 --> 02:39.238
That's not funny.

02:46.319 --> 02:48.588
Tell me somethin', boy.

02:51.088 --> 02:55.244
How did you have
this elopement planned out?

02:55.311 --> 02:57.286
How were you fixin'
to go about it?

02:57.360 --> 03:00.109
Tomorrow night
during the dance...

03:00.176 --> 03:03.242
Charlotte and I planned to meet
out in the summerhouse.

03:03.312 --> 03:05.166
<i>She was gonna have
her bags packed...</i>

03:05.232 --> 03:08.647
and we were gonna
go away together, that's all.

03:08.720 --> 03:11.687
And I had got us a room in Baton Rouge.
We're gonna stay there.

03:11.760 --> 03:14.094
I don't wanna hear about that.

03:14.159 --> 03:17.225
Well, you asked me,
so I just told you, that's all.

03:19.215 --> 03:21.125
Now...

03:23.376 --> 03:26.376
you shut your filthy mouth...

03:26.447 --> 03:29.481
and you listen to me.

03:29.551 --> 03:31.787
Charlotte doesn't know
about this.

03:31.856 --> 03:34.605
She doesn't know
you're here now.

03:34.671 --> 03:38.249
She doesn't even know
Jewel was here last night.

03:38.319 --> 03:41.931
How do you mean,
Jewel was here last night?

03:41.999 --> 03:45.098
You mean to tell me that my wife
come over here to talk to you?

03:45.167 --> 03:49.291
As I recollect, she was sittin'
right about here.

04:05.199 --> 04:07.054
Now...

04:08.623 --> 04:12.453
you're gonna come to that dance
tomorrow night with your wife.

04:12.527 --> 04:15.277
<i>You're gonna meet Charlotte
in the summerhouse...</i>

04:15.343 --> 04:18.442
<i>just like you planned...</i>

04:18.511 --> 04:21.228
<i>but what you're gonna
whisper in her ear...</i>

04:23.183 --> 04:25.704
<i>it's gonna be
somethin'else again.</i>

04:35.503 --> 04:38.700
<i>Come on, baby.
We haven't even danced once.</i>

04:52.527 --> 04:55.429
Champagne wouldn't
be half the fun without prohibition.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.870
Sure would like to meet
Sam's bootlegger.

05:00.815 --> 05:04.393
Sam Hollis sure knows
how to give a party.

05:04.463 --> 05:06.700
I just love to Charleston.

05:12.495 --> 05:14.732
Ginny Mae? Ginny Mae,
you seen Charlotte anyplace?

05:14.799 --> 05:16.621
I got some killing news to tell her.

05:16.687 --> 05:18.542
I haven't seen her
for a long time now.

05:18.607 --> 05:21.574
The last time I saw her,
she was dancin' with John Mayhew.

05:21.647 --> 05:25.739
<i>Yeah, and it looks like it's gonna be
quite a spell before you see her again.</i>

05:25.807 --> 05:27.978
I just gotta find...

05:59.567 --> 06:01.901
I made a mistake, Charlotte,
that's all.

06:06.927 --> 06:08.870
Don't cry.

06:15.855 --> 06:20.045
Look, I-I know
it's no consolation to you...

06:20.111 --> 06:22.086
but I really loved you
at one time.

06:28.015 --> 06:31.244
Try and understand that.
I really loved you.

06:37.231 --> 06:40.297
<i>I could kill you!</i>

07:10.383 --> 07:14.312
James! You ought to know you can't open
them cases with a thing like that.

07:14.383 --> 07:17.700
Look here. Why do you think
I brought this special?

07:36.207 --> 07:39.436
<i>- Good evening, Mr. And Mrs. Howard.
- Oh, Geraldine.</i>

07:39.503 --> 07:42.153
Hasn't this been
just the loveliest evening?

07:42.223 --> 07:45.802
We have to go now.
Be a dear and thank Mr. Hollis for us.

07:45.871 --> 07:49.253
- I just can't find him anywhere.
- I'll do that little old thing, Mr. Howard.

07:49.327 --> 07:51.182
Thank you, dear.
Good night, ladies.

07:51.247 --> 07:53.157
- Good night.
- Good night, Mr. And Mrs. Howard.

08:34.126 --> 08:38.501
Charlotte?

08:59.151 --> 09:02.926
Charlotte...
Aah!

09:02.991 --> 09:05.063
No!

09:05.135 --> 09:07.656
No!

09:07.727 --> 09:09.865
No!

09:09.935 --> 09:12.652
Oh, my God!

09:16.879 --> 09:19.562
<i>Come on. Once more.</i>

09:21.167 --> 09:25.477
Okay. Now, one more time!

09:45.006 --> 09:47.308
<i>Oh, there's Charlotte.</i>

09:57.935 --> 10:00.139
<i>Somebody ought to call a doctor.</i>

10:42.479 --> 10:45.894
Charlotte, honey...

10:47.375 --> 10:49.230
you come with me now.

10:49.295 --> 10:51.204
No, Papa.

10:52.462 --> 10:56.456
No, Papa.
L- I don't want to, Papa.

10:58.031 --> 11:00.071
No, Papa.

11:00.142 --> 11:03.754
- I don't want to, Papa.
- Come with me, baby.

11:03.823 --> 11:05.733
No, Papa.

11:15.567 --> 11:17.803
<i>Boy, it sure is spooky around here.</i>

11:17.871 --> 11:21.766
<i>Especially the graveyard.
Gets spookier. You'll see.</i>

11:21.839 --> 11:24.556
- Hurry up. It's gettin' late.
- You think there really is a ghost?

11:24.623 --> 11:27.885
<i>- Who knows?
- Sure, there's a ghost. There's the house now.</i>

11:27.951 --> 11:31.049
Gives me the creeps
every time I see it.

11:33.199 --> 11:35.566
- What if she catches me?
- Shh!

11:35.631 --> 11:38.446
Then you tell her you'reJewel Mayhew
from down the road...

11:38.511 --> 11:41.707
and you come a-lookin'
for your poor, little old husband's head.

11:43.694 --> 11:45.636
What if she catches me?

11:45.711 --> 11:49.573
Now, look, you wanna join
the Spiders, don't you?

11:49.647 --> 11:51.654
Well, get on in there.

11:51.726 --> 11:54.181
Don't forget to get somethin'
she touched with her own hands.

11:54.254 --> 11:58.891
Watch out for that cleaver, now.
She's just liable to chop off your little head.

11:58.958 --> 12:01.958
Now, go on!
We haven't got all night.

12:06.863 --> 12:09.034
Go on! Go on!

13:56.876 --> 13:58.786
John?

13:58.861 --> 14:01.927
- Get out of here!
- Hurry! She'll catch us!

14:01.997 --> 14:04.298
<i>- She ain't catchin'me.!
- Come on.! Move.!</i>

14:05.932 --> 14:09.544
<i>- I'm scared!
- I'm runnin', I'm runnin',</i>

14:09.612 --> 14:12.646
<i>Chop, chop
sweet Charlotte</i>

14:12.717 --> 14:16.262
<i>Chop, chop
till he's dead</i>

14:16.332 --> 14:18.983
<i>Chop, chop
sweet Charlotte</i>

14:19.052 --> 14:23.111
<i>Chop off
his hand and head</i>

14:24.429 --> 14:28.203
<i>To meet your lover
you ran, chop, chop</i>

14:28.269 --> 14:31.335
<i>Now everyone understands</i>

14:31.405 --> 14:34.918
<i>Just why you ran to meet your love
chop, chop</i>

14:34.989 --> 14:38.501
<i>To chop off
his head and hand</i>

14:38.572 --> 14:41.671
<i>Chop, chop
sweet Charlotte</i>

14:41.740 --> 14:46.596
<i>Chop, chop
till he's dead</i>

16:37.581 --> 16:39.523
Damn you!

16:48.364 --> 16:50.786
Damn you!

16:50.861 --> 16:54.789
Get off my property,
or I'll shoot!

16:56.685 --> 17:00.198
<i>I told you
to get off my property.!</i>

17:00.269 --> 17:03.051
Stan, look out!
Look out up there! Stan!

17:12.811 --> 17:16.838
- Man, oh, man!
- That crazy woman. I'm tellin' you.

17:16.907 --> 17:19.112
I wouldn't go out there
if I was you.

17:19.180 --> 17:22.758
Now, what do you think you're doin',
firing on my man like that?

17:22.828 --> 17:25.445
That's my land
he's plowin' up down there.

17:25.516 --> 17:29.313
<i>Damn it.!
Ma'am, you could have killed him.</i>

17:29.388 --> 17:31.755
If I'd been aimin' to kill him,
I would have.

17:31.820 --> 17:35.682
Now, see here, Miss Hollis. We done
everything we could to accommodate you.

17:35.756 --> 17:37.611
But this time,
you've gone too far.

17:37.676 --> 17:40.294
Now, we got a bridge to build
and roads to lay...

17:40.364 --> 17:42.274
and we ain't got no more time
to fool with ya.

17:43.373 --> 17:46.984
Where you are,
I could spit in your eye...

17:47.053 --> 17:49.092
with no strain at all.

17:49.164 --> 17:51.881
Now, Miss Hollis,
I ain't in no mood for jokes.

17:51.948 --> 17:54.632
I'm goin' straight into town
and see the sheriff.

17:54.700 --> 17:56.555
I don't care where
you go straight to...

17:56.620 --> 17:59.816
<i>just so long as you go
and take that and them with you.</i>

17:59.885 --> 18:03.146
Now, Miss Hollis, you know as well
as I do the State of Louisiana...

18:03.212 --> 18:07.490
requisitioned this whole area, includin'
your house, more than six months ago.

18:07.565 --> 18:10.150
Just because some old fool in Baton Rouge
signed a little bitty piece of paper...

18:10.220 --> 18:12.075
doesn't make it so.

18:12.140 --> 18:14.279
Nobody ever asked me
to sign anything...

18:14.349 --> 18:16.967
and nobody's gonna
tear down my house...

18:17.036 --> 18:19.425
to build a piddlin' bridge
or anything else.

18:19.501 --> 18:21.956
So you just clear off
my property once and for all!

18:22.029 --> 18:24.298
I don't know.
Some folks seem to think...

18:24.364 --> 18:27.680
they got a natural-born right
to get away with murder.

18:29.645 --> 18:31.816
Hey, look out!

18:42.316 --> 18:46.659
<i>You sure had yourself a good time today,
didn't you, missy?</i>

18:46.733 --> 18:50.049
You just cool down now.

18:53.036 --> 18:56.266
What are you gonna do, boss?

18:56.333 --> 18:59.180
I'm goin' into town, and you keep
those boys out of sight till I get back.

18:59.244 --> 19:01.481
- Okay, boss.
- I'll bring that sheriff back out here...

19:01.548 --> 19:03.970
in a half hour
if I have to drag him out.

19:06.189 --> 19:10.345
Ah. You fixed things up for fair.

19:10.412 --> 19:12.616
Come on. Come on.

19:12.684 --> 19:15.816
But they're gonna dig up the graves.
Papa's grave.

19:15.885 --> 19:17.739
They wasn't within
100 feet of them graves.

19:17.805 --> 19:20.390
Anyhow, they're fixin'
to tear down the whole house.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.657
I don't see what difference
plowin' up the grounds is gonna make.

19:23.724 --> 19:27.106
Come on.
Come on, now.

19:27.180 --> 19:30.726
They offered to move your pappy's remains.
You should've let 'em.

19:30.797 --> 19:33.830
They can't do him any harm now.

19:33.900 --> 19:38.919
Now, go on in there
and get yourself quieted down.

19:38.988 --> 19:41.770
<i>You've done enough
for one day.</i>

19:45.484 --> 19:47.394
<i>Let me tell you somethin',</i>

19:47.469 --> 19:51.811
<i>Ain't gonna be but a half an hour
before that sheriff comes over here.</i>

19:51.884 --> 19:55.681
So you get yourself
dressed up real pretty...

19:55.757 --> 19:58.757
and you come on downstairs
and get your breakfast.

19:58.829 --> 20:02.887
If Luke Standish ever comes out here,
he'll be real sorry.

20:02.956 --> 20:07.691
You hush. That ain't no way
to talk, Miss Charlotte.

20:07.756 --> 20:11.531
Now, you come on.
Get yourself dressed.

20:11.596 --> 20:16.069
Velma'll go downstairs
and fix you a nice breakfast.

20:16.140 --> 20:20.264
Don't you worry about that sheriff
when he comes out here.

20:20.332 --> 20:22.601
Velma'll get rid of him.

20:22.668 --> 20:25.123
Yes, sir.

20:25.196 --> 20:27.368
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

20:49.869 --> 20:52.105
It's not very often
we have a homicide...

20:52.172 --> 20:56.133
and never able to find
the victim's head and hand.

20:56.204 --> 21:00.547
I'm not much concerned about
examining your credentials, Mr. Wills.

21:00.620 --> 21:03.719
I'm happy to go along
with anything you say.

21:03.788 --> 21:07.465
I just have my doubts about
what you can expect to find.

21:07.532 --> 21:11.394
We've had newsmen and all sorts
comin' down here for 35 years or more...

21:11.468 --> 21:13.323
and none of'em any the wiser.

21:13.388 --> 21:15.941
I don't expect to unearth
anything extraordinary.

21:16.012 --> 21:18.151
After all, there's
nothing really unusual...

21:18.220 --> 21:20.489
about an unclaimed
insurance policy.

21:20.556 --> 21:22.923
It's just that
I don't want to upset anybody.

21:22.988 --> 21:24.930
So if you'll just go along
with my little masquerade...

21:25.004 --> 21:28.779
of a reporter from one
of our more esoteric crime magazines...

21:28.844 --> 21:31.877
I'd be most awfully grateful to you.

21:31.948 --> 21:35.527
Well, Mr. Wills, since you've come
all the way from London, England to see us...

21:35.597 --> 21:37.833
I guess we'll just
have to oblige you...

21:37.900 --> 21:41.446
esoteric magazines and all.

21:41.516 --> 21:43.458
I'm sorry, Mr. Standish.

21:43.532 --> 21:46.793
You're gonna to have to come out to the
Hollis place. We got real trouble this time.

21:48.876 --> 21:51.560
What a remarkable coincidence.

21:51.628 --> 21:53.483
By the way, Sheriff...

21:53.548 --> 21:56.297
I wonder if you could arrange
for me to meetJewel Mayhew?

21:56.364 --> 21:58.600
<i>I guess we'll just
have to oblige you.</i>

21:58.668 --> 22:00.578
Thank you very much.

22:16.908 --> 22:20.039
- Velma!
- What?

22:20.109 --> 22:24.069
<i>The sheriffs comin',
Get rid ofhim. Hear?</i>

22:24.140 --> 22:26.377
Oh.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.825
She's not really crazy.
She just acts that way...

22:30.892 --> 22:33.031
because people seem
to expect it of her.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.954
You can wait in the car.

22:36.876 --> 22:38.764
She ain't a-gonna come down.

22:41.900 --> 22:45.195
You can't see her. She's sick.

22:45.260 --> 22:47.333
All that dust and all that racket
from your machines...

22:47.404 --> 22:49.859
<i>has made her real sick.</i>

22:49.932 --> 22:53.544
She's waiting for Dr. Drew
to come and tend to her right now.

22:53.612 --> 22:57.889
That's too bad, 'cause there's
a little matter of an unlicensed gun.

22:57.964 --> 23:00.452
- I was hopin' Miss Hollis
maybe could help me find it.

23:00.524 --> 23:04.234
Well, I reckon I'll just
have to look for it myself, Miss Cruther.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.602
<i>Mornin', Miss Charlotte.</i>

23:06.668 --> 23:08.970
Get out, Luke Standish!

23:09.036 --> 23:11.425
You smirkin'Judas...

23:11.500 --> 23:13.409
comin' around here
with your lyin' tricks!

23:13.484 --> 23:15.339
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

23:15.404 --> 23:17.673
Papa gave you the first job
you ever had in this town.

23:17.740 --> 23:19.775
Without him, you wouldn't
be Sheriff or anything else.

23:19.785 --> 23:20.937
I know that, Miss Charlotte.

23:21.004 --> 23:23.011
- That's why I'm trying to help you.
- Help me?

23:23.084 --> 23:26.379
You had orders
to leave this house long ago.

23:26.444 --> 23:29.761
If I'd been doin' my job,
you'd have been long gone by now.

23:29.837 --> 23:32.771
If you are so anxious to help me...

23:32.844 --> 23:34.699
why don't you leave me alone?

23:34.764 --> 23:39.947
And tell everybody to stop threatenin' me
with cuttin' off my water and electricity.

23:40.012 --> 23:41.867
I can't, Miss Charlotte.

23:41.932 --> 23:44.037
What you did today
puts it right out of my hands.

23:44.108 --> 23:46.977
Threatenin' people's one thing,
but shootin' at 'em's another.

23:47.052 --> 23:50.849
I got orders now to see
that you're gone within 10 days.

23:50.924 --> 23:52.779
They can hold up on the blastin'
they've gotta do...

23:52.844 --> 23:56.259
and keep the men and equipment workin' on the
approach road on the other side of the river.

23:56.332 --> 23:58.666
But if you aren't out of here
by the end of next week...

23:58.732 --> 24:01.318
the county commissioner is gonna
have you up for criminal action.

24:01.388 --> 24:05.796
But this is my home.
I haven't any other place to go.

24:05.868 --> 24:09.283
- They can build their damn bridge anywhere.
- No, ma'am.

24:09.356 --> 24:13.480
They have to build it to meet up
with the road on the other side of the river.

24:13.548 --> 24:15.402
There isn't any alternative.

24:15.468 --> 24:19.941
End of next week,
this house is comin' down.

24:20.012 --> 24:22.215
When my cousin Miriam comes...

24:22.284 --> 24:24.138
she'll know how to deal
with the county commissioner.

24:24.204 --> 24:28.579
- I didn't know you were expectin' her.
- Well, I am.

24:28.652 --> 24:31.815
Afraid she won't make a bit of difference
as far as the bridge is concerned.

24:31.884 --> 24:34.404
We'll wait and see.

24:34.476 --> 24:37.705
I reckon we will. I ain't gonna take
that gun away from you, Miss Charlotte.

24:37.772 --> 24:40.489
I certainly hope you aren't
plannin' on using it again.

24:40.556 --> 24:43.011
Comin' in here to fetch you out
is the last thing I wanna do.

24:43.084 --> 24:45.986
Then don't come!

25:05.804 --> 25:11.205
What'd you wanna go tellin' him stories
about Miss Miriam for?

25:11.276 --> 25:13.283
She ain't even answered your letters.

25:14.316 --> 25:16.553
Well, she's comin' anyway.

25:16.620 --> 25:21.060
<i>Be the saddest day of your life, missy,
if she does come.</i>

25:21.132 --> 25:25.223
Your cousin Miriam ain't never had
but one idea in her head...

25:25.291 --> 25:27.430
and that was
lookin' out for herself.

25:28.684 --> 25:30.756
She's gotta come.

25:30.828 --> 25:33.545
She's the only kin I got left.

25:43.084 --> 25:45.505
Miriam's just gotta come.

25:45.580 --> 25:48.263
She's the only one
who can help me now.

25:48.331 --> 25:51.331
<i>She's just gotta come.</i>

25:51.404 --> 25:53.826
<i>I guess there's been
a whole heap of changes...</i>

25:53.900 --> 25:56.276
<i>in this part of the country
since you was here last, miss.</i>

25:56.373 --> 25:57.609
I imagine there have been.

25:57.676 --> 26:00.524
'Course, things ain't changed much
in this parish...

26:00.588 --> 26:03.010
exceptin' folks are gettin'
a lot older than they used to be.

26:03.083 --> 26:04.938
I suppose they are.

26:10.156 --> 26:13.004
There's absolutely no point
you're gettin' so upset...

26:13.068 --> 26:16.199
the way you did this morning.

26:16.268 --> 26:19.334
<i>Anyone who knew you
less well than I do might be forgiven...</i>

26:19.403 --> 26:22.949
for thinkin' you had
a persecution complex.

26:23.020 --> 26:25.540
<i>Yes, Dr. Drew.</i>

26:25.612 --> 26:27.467
Charlotte...

26:27.532 --> 26:30.794
<i>they are asking you
to leave this house...</i>

26:30.860 --> 26:34.657
because they are going
to tear it down...

26:34.732 --> 26:37.634
<i>not because of any
of the ulterior motives...</i>

26:37.708 --> 26:40.097
- that you seem to imagine.

26:40.171 --> 26:42.244
- What's that?
- Oh, Charlotte, please.

26:42.316 --> 26:47.401
- Don't get so jumpy about everything.
- It's Miriam!

26:47.468 --> 26:50.632
Miriam isn't expected
till tomorrow evenin'.

26:50.700 --> 26:52.871
Now, come on.
Calm down.

26:57.260 --> 26:59.977
Well, ma'am, this is it.

27:00.044 --> 27:02.248
They say that places
you knew as a child...

27:02.316 --> 27:05.283
always seem smaller
than your memory of them.

27:05.356 --> 27:07.909
<i>It's not true.</i>

27:11.404 --> 27:13.891
Huh.

27:30.347 --> 27:33.195
Velma.

27:33.260 --> 27:35.878
Velma Cruther.

27:35.948 --> 27:38.501
Shall I take these in, miss?

27:38.572 --> 27:40.460
Thank you.
Just put them up there.

27:47.212 --> 27:49.601
It's just as I left it.

27:52.940 --> 27:56.485
<i>- How much is that?
- $2.50, ma'am.</i>

28:07.500 --> 28:10.020
<i>- Keep the change.
- Thank you, ma'am.</i>

28:20.108 --> 28:23.239
You nearly beat your telegram here.

28:23.308 --> 28:26.755
I know I'm a day early.
I hope it won't inconvenience anybody.

28:26.828 --> 28:29.195
<i>Miriam.!</i>

28:29.259 --> 28:31.528
I just can't believe it.

28:31.596 --> 28:35.370
<i>- You look marvelous.
- What is it that you can't believe, Drew?</i>

28:35.436 --> 28:37.923
<i>That I'm here,
or that I look the way I do?</i>

28:37.996 --> 28:41.062
Come on. Don't make fun
of an old man.

28:41.131 --> 28:44.427
You know I never was any good
at expressin' myself.

28:44.492 --> 28:46.980
Oh, that's not so at all, Drew.

28:47.051 --> 28:50.019
You were always very quick
with your compliments.

28:53.292 --> 28:56.325
It was just your intentions...

28:57.900 --> 29:02.057
that were sometimes a little vague.

29:02.124 --> 29:04.779
You all want this stuff upstairs?

29:04.907 --> 29:08.006
I'll give you a hand
in just a minute.

29:08.075 --> 29:12.384
I suppose you wanna see Charlotte.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.980
I think I already have.

29:15.051 --> 29:19.807
- Won't she be coming down?
- I think we'd better go up. She's a bit upset.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.379
Well, there was a little trouble
here this mornin'.

29:21.380 --> 29:22.272
Trouble?

29:22.347 --> 29:24.419
Nothin' serious.

29:24.490 --> 29:27.654
And, besides, you took us by surprise.
We weren't expectin' you till tomorrow.

29:27.722 --> 29:30.537
There was a mix-up.
I had to take an earlier plane.

29:30.602 --> 29:32.675
What kind of trouble?

29:33.738 --> 29:37.251
Just plain, blind stubborn.

29:37.322 --> 29:41.414
With her money, she could live anywhere
in the world like a queen.

29:41.483 --> 29:44.581
But as it is, I'm afraid you'll have more
than your hands full...

29:44.650 --> 29:47.269
gettin' her out of this place.

29:49.771 --> 29:52.902
The three of us used to slide
down this banister.

29:52.971 --> 29:54.913
I was always the champion.

29:54.987 --> 29:58.533
We just let you win
because you were the youngest.

30:00.683 --> 30:04.480
An old house is difficult
to keep clean.

30:06.251 --> 30:09.033
If you can get anybody out
from town to work in this place...

30:09.099 --> 30:10.954
you're doin' a lot better
than I can.

30:11.019 --> 30:13.921
Don't misunderstand me, Velma.

30:13.995 --> 30:16.329
I know how exhausting
it must be...

30:16.395 --> 30:18.948
having to do all the work
out here alone.

30:25.674 --> 30:28.009
There's a lot more bags out there.

30:45.386 --> 30:47.426
<i>Charlotte, it's Miriam.</i>

31:06.762 --> 31:09.413
How good it was getting your letter
asking me to come.

31:19.019 --> 31:23.656
Miriam! I knew you'd come!
I just knew you would.

31:23.723 --> 31:26.985
- And you're gonna help me.
- Of course I'll do whatever I can.

31:27.051 --> 31:30.629
I've thought of you and the house.
It's like coming home.

31:30.699 --> 31:33.961
Oh, but everything
is-is-is such a mess.

31:34.027 --> 31:38.184
You see, I wasn't expectin' you
until tomorrow.

31:38.251 --> 31:40.520
Don't worry. We're together again.
That's the important thing.

31:40.587 --> 31:43.522
Yes. Of course it is.

31:48.171 --> 31:50.113
Miss Charlotte's room.

31:51.947 --> 31:55.242
Remember the night you taught me
how to smoke my first cigarette, and you...

31:55.306 --> 31:58.689
or was it I... set the drapes on fire?

32:00.331 --> 32:03.080
I was the one
they whopped, I know.

32:03.146 --> 32:06.561
No! That's Velma's job!

32:06.634 --> 32:10.147
Yes, but Velma's...
well, Velma.

32:16.842 --> 32:20.704
It's just that we haven't
seen each other in so long...

32:20.778 --> 32:23.364
you'd think we'd have
other things to talk about.

32:23.435 --> 32:27.013
I mean, arguing about
who's gonna make up the bed.

32:39.786 --> 32:43.398
If you all want me
to fix supper for you...

32:43.466 --> 32:46.314
you better eat early...

32:46.379 --> 32:48.234
because I gotta get home.

32:48.299 --> 32:50.186
Well, thank you, Velma.

32:50.251 --> 32:54.047
- Is that an invitation?
- No!

32:54.122 --> 32:57.984
I just reckon you'd be
sniffin' around here more than usual...

32:58.059 --> 33:00.514
now that Miss Miriam's back.

33:00.586 --> 33:02.441
There's nothin' like a family reunion.

33:02.506 --> 33:06.368
I think I'll just get
the key to the cellar.

33:07.722 --> 33:12.130
Hmph! Just thinks he's gonna get
the key to the cellar.

33:12.203 --> 33:15.519
Well, it's the only thing.

33:20.427 --> 33:25.249
I didn't know Ida told you
where the keys to the cellar were.

33:25.323 --> 33:27.232
Thank you, sir.

33:28.651 --> 33:32.131
I can't remember when
I last dined in here.

33:32.203 --> 33:35.748
Papa used to say
this was his favorite room.

33:35.818 --> 33:37.891
I guess maybe that's 'cause
he loved to eat so much.

33:37.963 --> 33:40.199
<i>You know, Miriam...</i>

33:40.266 --> 33:42.438
when all this nonsense
about the house is straightened out...

33:42.507 --> 33:45.158
we could give parties here again.

33:48.331 --> 33:51.331
Why not? What's so
impossible about that?

33:51.403 --> 33:54.086
It would be lovely.

33:54.154 --> 33:56.293
Yes, it would be nice.

33:56.363 --> 33:59.975
Aren't you forgettin' about the limit
they put on vacatin' the house?

34:00.043 --> 34:03.588
You've got to be out of here a week from
Monday, and there's no two ways about it.

34:03.658 --> 34:05.513
Drew, you carry on
as if you're a member...

34:05.578 --> 34:08.130
of the Department
of Roads and Bridges, or somethin'.

34:08.202 --> 34:10.438
Miriam will tell them where to get off,
won't you, Cousin, darling?

34:10.507 --> 34:12.362
I wish I could.

34:12.427 --> 34:16.355
Charlotte, you have just
got to understand...

34:16.426 --> 34:18.565
that there's nothin',
absolutely nothin'...

34:18.635 --> 34:20.806
that Miriam or anybody else
can do about it.

34:20.873 --> 34:24.933
Now, they are going to tear down
this house, and that is final.

34:25.003 --> 34:27.141
Oh, you're so stuffy.

34:27.210 --> 34:30.025
They took their smelly old equipment
out of here, didn't they?

34:30.090 --> 34:33.800
Miriam isn't frightened of
a bunch of crooked politicians.

34:33.866 --> 34:35.721
You know, it wouldn't surprise me
to find out...

34:35.786 --> 34:38.208
<i>thatJewel Mayhew is behind all this.</i>

34:38.283 --> 34:41.478
Charlotte, that is ridiculous!

34:41.545 --> 34:44.960
Is it? You notice they're not laying
a finger on her land.

34:45.034 --> 34:47.969
<i>They're destroying my house,
but they're not touching hers.</i>

34:48.043 --> 34:49.898
I've rented a car for you, Miriam.

34:49.963 --> 34:53.192
<i>- You can go tomorrow.
- Go where?</i>

34:53.259 --> 34:56.674
To Baton Rouge to put that damn
county commissioner straight.

35:00.331 --> 35:02.470
Charlotte...

35:02.539 --> 35:04.644
there's nothing I wouldn't do
for you if I could.

35:04.715 --> 35:08.392
You know that.
But I'm afraid Drew's right.

35:08.459 --> 35:12.136
There isn't anything
we can do about the house.

35:12.203 --> 35:14.058
You have to leave.

35:27.530 --> 35:31.654
What do you think
I asked you here for?

35:31.722 --> 35:34.308
Company?

35:34.379 --> 35:36.288
I thought you were
gonna help me!

35:36.362 --> 35:40.453
But I shall. That's why I came...
to help, to be with you.

35:40.522 --> 35:42.791
To be with me?

35:42.859 --> 35:46.274
I've lived alone here
ever since Papa died.

35:46.347 --> 35:49.642
The only people I've ever seen
are Velma and Drew...

35:49.706 --> 35:53.121
who comes out when he feels like it
just to see if I'm still alive...

35:53.194 --> 35:55.104
<i>- Charlotte, that's not true.
- and a bunch of sniggering idiots...</i>

35:55.178 --> 35:57.251
<i>who come out here
to make fun of me.</i>

35:57.323 --> 36:00.257
Do you think
I'd ask you back here...

36:00.330 --> 36:02.240
just-just to be with me?

36:02.315 --> 36:06.755
<i>Charlotte, she's only tryin'
to lend a helpin'hand.</i>

36:06.826 --> 36:09.346
Oh, yes. I can see that.

36:09.418 --> 36:13.575
She's just breakin' her back.

36:13.643 --> 36:17.221
God, do you have gratitude!

36:17.290 --> 36:19.363
When you first came here
after your precious papa died...

36:19.434 --> 36:21.801
<i>you acted as if
we weren't good enough for you.</i>

36:21.867 --> 36:26.471
- And your mama, a sorry, up-north waitress...
- Charlotte, that's enough.

36:26.538 --> 36:29.473
Let her talk, Drew, if insulting me
gives her any satisfaction.

36:29.547 --> 36:32.962
When you first came here, Papa took you
downtown, bought you a whole new wardrobe.

36:33.035 --> 36:36.712
- Does it insult you to remember that?
- Yes, I remember.

36:36.779 --> 36:39.713
You took your poor, up-north cousin
downtown for a whole new wardrobe...

36:39.786 --> 36:42.088
down to a sleazy store
he wouldn't even let you set foot in.

36:42.154 --> 36:45.569
Oh, that wasn't good enough for you?
Papa didn't give you enough?

36:45.642 --> 36:47.584
Well, maybe that's what
you came back here for...

36:47.658 --> 36:49.567
to get the rest of Papa's money.

36:49.642 --> 36:53.668
Charlotte! I have a career,
and I've given up valuable time to come here.

36:53.738 --> 36:57.153
I know. Now, let me see.
What-What is it you call your job?

36:57.226 --> 37:01.001
Oh, yes. Public relations.
Sounds like somethin' pretty dirty to me.

37:01.066 --> 37:03.849
The dirt, Charlotte,
is entirely in your own mind.

37:03.915 --> 37:05.857
I wouldn't dwell on it
if I were you, Charlotte.

37:05.931 --> 37:07.785
She didn't come here
to be insulted.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.923
No, most likely she came back here
to helpJewel Mayhew...

37:09.994 --> 37:12.547
- drive me out of my own house.
- Charlotte, you don't believe that.

37:14.602 --> 37:19.010
Why wouldn't Miriam conspire
with Jewel against me?

37:19.082 --> 37:21.733
Who was it went
sneakin' off toJewel...

37:21.803 --> 37:25.894
and told her about her husband
and me in the first place?

37:33.771 --> 37:36.040
Didn't know about that,
did you, Drew?

37:39.435 --> 37:44.137
That's somethin' you never told
your precious boyfriend, isn't that so, Miriam?

37:45.162 --> 37:48.511
<i>Isn't it, Cousin, darling?</i>

37:54.539 --> 37:57.670
Yes, I told Jewel.
And I told your father too.

37:57.738 --> 38:02.178
Why wouldn't I? After all,
I wasn't much more than a child then.

38:02.250 --> 38:05.250
And all I ever got in this house
was people telling me how lucky I was...

38:05.322 --> 38:08.999
and your father always favoring you
and holding you up as an example!

38:09.066 --> 38:12.776
<i>Why wouldn't I tell him
that his pure, darling little girl...</i>

38:12.842 --> 38:16.868
was having a dirty little affair
with a married man?

38:18.218 --> 38:21.153
You're a vile, sorry little bitch!

38:21.226 --> 38:25.765
How was I to know it would end
in murder with John being butchered?

38:49.546 --> 38:51.401
No, you couldn't have known that.

38:52.874 --> 38:55.973
And you couldn't have known
that when Drew found out...

38:56.042 --> 38:58.889
he was so frightened of having
his fine old name linked with ours...

38:58.954 --> 39:01.093
that he'd walk out on you.

39:03.819 --> 39:05.673
But Drew's still here...

39:05.739 --> 39:09.383
and you're both still alive and...

39:11.146 --> 39:13.480
and I'm still here.

39:16.714 --> 39:18.569
But, John...

39:21.130 --> 39:23.847
John never even...

39:37.450 --> 39:40.712
John? John?

39:42.346 --> 39:45.216
John?

39:47.467 --> 39:48.470
John.

39:48.503 --> 39:49.474
John.

39:53.674 --> 39:56.489
She is deranged, Drew.
She must be.

39:56.554 --> 40:01.988
Well, no. She's certainly worse
than when I last wrote you...

40:02.058 --> 40:06.401
but not to the extent
of being committed.

40:06.474 --> 40:10.729
I'm sorry. There's just no way
to avoid the problem.

40:10.794 --> 40:12.899
There are times when...

40:12.970 --> 40:16.865
she genuinely doesn't know
what she's saying, but...

40:16.938 --> 40:18.978
On the other hand,
I thought she described...

40:19.051 --> 40:22.280
the way you left me
rather accurately.

40:22.346 --> 40:25.095
If it's any comfort,
I've always regretted...

40:26.218 --> 40:29.088
having let you go.

40:32.362 --> 40:35.329
We don't have time
for regrets now, Drew.

40:40.171 --> 40:44.873
And there is a lot to regret.

40:48.714 --> 40:50.623
John?

40:57.514 --> 40:59.369
John?

41:02.474 --> 41:05.157
What a shame.
With all that money...

41:05.226 --> 41:08.772
she could have done
such wonderful things with this place...

41:08.842 --> 41:11.689
made it so beautiful again.

41:11.754 --> 41:14.688
How could she stand
being alone here all these years?

41:14.762 --> 41:19.650
People who oblige to live alone have
a habit of creatin' company for themselves.

41:19.722 --> 41:23.814
Innocent fancies
can become fixed delusions.

41:23.882 --> 41:27.656
I think she never fully accepted
John Mayhew's death.

41:27.722 --> 41:30.536
At least, part of her mind hasn't.

41:30.602 --> 41:33.122
Sometimes, she speaks of him...

41:33.194 --> 41:37.253
as if he were still alive
here in this house...

41:37.322 --> 41:41.283
as if she could still
feel his personality.

41:41.354 --> 41:44.703
She plays that old harpsichord,
the song he wrote for her.

41:46.826 --> 41:50.175
Often at night,
she sits up dressed...

41:50.251 --> 41:52.738
as if she were still young...

41:52.810 --> 41:54.883
and expectin' a beau.

41:56.330 --> 42:00.486
I seem to remember expecting
something like that once myself.

42:11.754 --> 42:14.885
You going to be all right here?
I could stay over.

42:14.954 --> 42:17.824
You've been content to let me get along
on my own all these years.

42:17.898 --> 42:20.036
I don't think another night
is gonna kill me.

42:20.106 --> 42:22.473
I guess you're right.

42:24.938 --> 42:27.272
Oh, uh...

42:27.338 --> 42:29.313
maybe you'd better have this.

42:29.386 --> 42:31.241
- What on earth for?
- Well, you never know.

42:31.306 --> 42:34.535
You do have people
skulkin' around here occasionally.

42:34.602 --> 42:38.530
- Anyway, you'd better take it.
- Thank you.

42:38.602 --> 42:40.577
Good night.

42:40.650 --> 42:42.559
Good night.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.887
Good night.

45:07.945 --> 45:10.531
My dress.

45:10.601 --> 45:12.837
Somebody slashed my dress.

45:39.273 --> 45:41.346
They certainly were
attractive youngsters.

45:41.417 --> 45:45.191
<i>Yes, sir. That was just about the biggest story
that ever broke in this town.</i>

45:45.257 --> 45:48.770
<i>Yes, I can see you gave it what you might call
"the full treatment".</i>

45:48.840 --> 45:52.070
Well, we couldn't very well bury it
on the society page, could we?

45:52.137 --> 45:55.781
Anyhow, help yourself. I think
you'll find everything that you need here.

45:55.849 --> 45:58.402
And that's a pretty good picture
of Miss Charlotte.

45:58.473 --> 46:01.343
Yes, it is.

46:01.417 --> 46:04.287
<i>I was working for the press
when she arrived in London.</i>

46:04.361 --> 46:08.289
Not one of us succeeded
in getting an interview with her.

46:08.361 --> 46:10.401
Well, they said that
Big Sam sent her over there...

46:10.473 --> 46:12.447
to prevent her from being
charged and tried.

46:12.521 --> 46:14.376
But that wasn't so.

46:14.441 --> 46:16.230
Sending her out of the country
wouldn't have helped.

46:16.297 --> 46:20.607
I reckon Sam's political connections
had more to do with it.

46:20.681 --> 46:24.063
As I remember, the district attorney
tried hard to make the charge stick...

46:24.137 --> 46:27.170
but the whole thing was transferred
over to Baton Rouge.

46:27.240 --> 46:31.681
I reckon Sam's friends in the capitol got busy,
because nothin' ever did come of it.

46:31.753 --> 46:34.949
Lack of evidence
was the official explanation.

46:35.017 --> 46:36.927
You wouldn't think so
from the headlines.

46:37.001 --> 46:40.514
Hi, Mr. Blake.
Thanks for the use of the hall.

46:40.585 --> 46:44.359
Tell me, are you running anything
on the return of Miriam Deering?

46:44.425 --> 46:46.563
Just an insert
in the social column.

46:46.633 --> 46:48.870
The social column. You gotta be kiddin'.

46:48.937 --> 46:52.549
Excuse me, Mr. Wills. This is a colleague
of yours, Mr. Marchand from New York.

46:52.617 --> 46:55.300
- How do you do?
- And who are you covering the story for?

46:55.369 --> 46:59.973
Don't worry about me, old chap.
My status is that of an amateur.

47:00.041 --> 47:02.080
By the way,
what journal do you represent?

47:02.152 --> 47:04.094
<i>Crimes of Passion
and Century Crime Classics.</i>

47:04.169 --> 47:06.984
You know, that Hollis dame hit the news
again over that business with the bridge.

47:07.049 --> 47:09.667
We did a special issue on her.
Here, take a look.

47:11.945 --> 47:15.523
<i>No head, no hand.
Just like the way it was.</i>

47:15.592 --> 47:18.407
Yes.

47:18.472 --> 47:23.142
- Very colorful.
- Yeah, we're really going to town on this one.

47:23.209 --> 47:25.631
Hey, Mr. Blake.

47:25.704 --> 47:28.093
<i>You never showed me this stuff.</i>

47:28.169 --> 47:31.650
<i>Well, one thing they didn't do then was
to play up the sex angle like you can today.</i>

47:44.169 --> 47:47.071
Miriam Deering.

47:54.057 --> 47:56.129
Miss Deering!

47:56.201 --> 47:59.201
My, it's good to see you back.

47:59.273 --> 48:03.746
- Jewel! Jewel Mayhew!
- Joseph.

48:03.817 --> 48:06.435
- Oh, here. Let me help you.
- You leave me be.

48:06.505 --> 48:09.025
If I ever prayed for anything...

48:09.097 --> 48:11.879
it was that you would never
dare show your face to me again.

48:11.945 --> 48:14.279
After all these years,
what do you mean?

48:14.345 --> 48:16.484
Do you honestly believe...

48:16.553 --> 48:19.651
that time can excuse all the things
you've done to me?

48:19.720 --> 48:22.469
Jewel, please don't.
Not here on the public steps.

48:22.470 --> 48:23.844
Oh, I see.

48:23.912 --> 48:25.855
Not in public.

48:25.928 --> 48:28.830
We mustn't speak the truth
out in the open, you and I, huh?

48:28.905 --> 48:31.393
It's not about me that I'm worried.

48:31.465 --> 48:34.182
Well, right here
on the public street...

48:34.249 --> 48:36.104
in the light of day...

48:36.169 --> 48:38.624
let me tell you, Miriam Deering...

48:38.697 --> 48:42.046
that murder starts in the heart...

48:42.121 --> 48:45.437
and its first weapon
is a vicious tongue.

48:45.513 --> 48:49.310
At the time, would anyone else
have been as kind to you as I?

48:49.385 --> 48:53.411
- Would they?
- Go away from me.

48:53.481 --> 48:57.736
<i>I'm ill. I'm very ill.</i>

48:59.657 --> 49:02.919
I won't give up
one more thing to you...

49:05.929 --> 49:08.864
not even one more minute.

49:11.208 --> 49:13.827
It's all right, Mrs. Mayhew.
Come along.

49:23.432 --> 49:25.287
<i>A world full of monsters.!</i>

49:25.352 --> 49:30.371
<i>Don't you ever show your white-trash face
in this house again.!</i>

49:35.017 --> 49:39.392
<i>Damn.! Just some damn meanness
all day long.</i>

49:39.465 --> 49:44.221
<i>Just one filthy mess to clean up
after another. She's nothin'but a child.</i>

49:44.296 --> 49:49.446
<i>She never does anything anyway.</i>

49:49.513 --> 49:52.033
<i>- Velma.
- Huh?</i>

49:52.105 --> 49:54.690
<i>Who brought this
into the house?</i>

49:54.760 --> 49:57.510
<i>I did.! I brought it in.</i>

49:57.577 --> 49:59.617
<i>It was in the mailbox
just like that.</i>

49:59.689 --> 50:02.591
<i>I reckon somebody put it there.
You know...</i>

50:02.665 --> 50:05.698
she broke that
dadburned teapot up there.

50:05.768 --> 50:09.565
Tea runnin' all down the wall.
Shoo-ee!

50:09.641 --> 50:12.259
Incidentally, I've managed to find
some women to do the packing.

50:12.329 --> 50:15.875
- Please let me know when they arrive.
- Oh!

50:15.945 --> 50:18.334
Them women, they just steal you
out of house and home.

50:18.408 --> 50:23.013
I got to get something
to fix this filthy stuff.

50:23.081 --> 50:26.856
"Incidentally, please tell me
when they arrive".

50:31.305 --> 50:35.745
<i>I told you to stay out.!</i>

50:45.896 --> 50:48.515
Charlotte, you're behaving
like a child...

50:48.585 --> 50:51.651
throwing a tantrum over a trivial bit
of rubbish like this.

50:53.737 --> 50:57.763
How can you touch
that piece of filth?

50:57.833 --> 51:00.167
It's only a magazine,
cheap and disgusting...

51:00.232 --> 51:02.621
and only cheap and disgusting people
will read it.

51:02.697 --> 51:06.756
It's Jewel Mayhew
deviling me in my own house.

51:06.825 --> 51:09.858
You thinkJewel Mayhew
brought it here?

51:09.929 --> 51:12.864
- She couldn't have.
- Why couldn't she have brought it here?

51:12.937 --> 51:16.963
I just saw her.
She's seriously ill...

51:17.033 --> 51:20.895
much too ill to be running around
playing silly games with magazines.

51:20.968 --> 51:23.107
Well, she deserves to be ill.

51:23.176 --> 51:25.511
She deserves to die!

51:25.577 --> 51:27.519
Charlotte!

51:27.593 --> 51:31.237
It's just possible thatJewel Mayhew
hasn't given you a sustained thought in years.

51:31.305 --> 51:33.694
Oh, you think so, do you?

51:33.769 --> 51:35.678
You think she's never
given me a thought?

51:49.673 --> 51:53.469
I've been gettin' these in the mail
ever sinceJohn died.

51:53.544 --> 51:56.741
That idiot Luke Standish told Papa they were...
they were crank notes.

51:56.809 --> 51:59.809
But then some reporter got a hold of'em
and put it in the newspaper.

51:59.881 --> 52:02.783
And then they started to come in
from all over the world.

52:02.856 --> 52:05.442
But the first one was mailed
right here in Hollisport...

52:05.512 --> 52:07.454
and that's where
the last one came from.

52:07.529 --> 52:12.286
And nobody can ever make me believe that
Jewel Mayhew didn't send them!

52:12.361 --> 52:15.110
- You saved all these?
- All of'em...

52:15.176 --> 52:18.722
to show how mean
and unforgiving she can be!

52:20.201 --> 52:22.241
Well...

52:22.313 --> 52:25.062
it's time you got rid of them.

52:25.128 --> 52:27.976
- What do you want now?
- I come to tell her somethin'.

52:28.041 --> 52:30.529
She could use some tellin'!

52:30.601 --> 52:35.838
Them packin' women
you've been lookin' for, they's arrived.

52:37.033 --> 52:38.942
I'll take care of it.

52:54.601 --> 52:57.797
This is my favorite place now...

52:57.864 --> 52:59.719
here in the shade.

52:59.784 --> 53:01.726
Yes, it's very pleasant here.

53:01.800 --> 53:03.971
Very pleasant indeed.

53:05.481 --> 53:08.230
Tell me, Mr. Wills,
weren't you a little surprised...

53:08.297 --> 53:10.239
when I agreed to see you?

53:10.312 --> 53:14.306
After all, you must've been told
that I don't normally receive visitors.

53:14.377 --> 53:16.995
Well, yes. But then,
I found the hospitality...

53:17.064 --> 53:20.064
of this part of the country extraordinary.

53:20.137 --> 53:22.526
Besides, I imagine
you had your reasons.

53:22.601 --> 53:24.608
Would you have
anything else, ma'am?

53:24.681 --> 53:27.976
Um, no.

53:28.040 --> 53:31.302
<i>- Thank you, Lewis.
- Thank you, ma'am.</i>

53:31.368 --> 53:34.849
I did have my reasons, Mr. Wills.

53:34.920 --> 53:38.401
- I did.
- I hope you won't regret it...

53:38.473 --> 53:41.789
but I did warn you I'd have to touch
on some painful subjects.

53:43.209 --> 53:45.063
Which leads me to confess...

53:45.129 --> 53:47.681
to my own reasons for this meetin'.

53:49.704 --> 53:53.446
I have a particular need
for a stranger now.

53:53.512 --> 53:58.052
Yes, they...
they have their uses, don't they?

53:58.121 --> 54:00.259
Well, in this little town...

54:00.328 --> 54:05.544
our interests are all too, uh...
too tightly interlocked.

54:05.609 --> 54:10.660
If you confide in one person,
you confide in the whole community.

54:10.728 --> 54:13.630
<i>You mean you'd like
somebody to talk to?</i>

54:13.704 --> 54:16.290
Only in a sense.

54:16.361 --> 54:18.215
I'm not a well woman.

54:18.281 --> 54:20.964
You can see that much for yourself.

54:21.032 --> 54:25.571
Who was it said,
"This long disease, my life"?

54:25.640 --> 54:29.535
Well, it's... it's comin' to an end.

54:29.609 --> 54:33.951
Perhaps a month, a few weeks.
Who knows?

54:34.024 --> 54:36.359
I'm terribly sorry.

54:36.425 --> 54:39.774
Oh, no, no.
Don't be, not for me.

54:39.848 --> 54:43.012
I think I'm even glad.

54:43.080 --> 54:45.153
But never mind that.
I take it you're no stranger...

54:45.225 --> 54:49.186
to the unhappier aspects
of people's lives.

54:49.257 --> 54:52.737
<i>In fact, the only way to trust someone
is on instinct alone.</i>

54:53.832 --> 54:56.134
I want you to have this.

54:56.200 --> 55:00.673
I only ask that you don't open it
until after I'm gone.

55:00.744 --> 55:05.566
Then I want you to use
your own judgment and experience.

55:05.640 --> 55:08.389
You'll know what to do
when the time comes...

55:09.417 --> 55:11.326
or what not to do.

55:12.840 --> 55:14.880
It seems a dreadful responsibility.

55:14.952 --> 55:16.807
Oh, it is. A terrible one.

55:16.872 --> 55:20.101
My honest advice is to refuse it.

55:20.168 --> 55:22.819
You know I won't, of course.

55:22.888 --> 55:25.954
I know.

55:26.024 --> 55:28.359
Ruined finery.

55:28.425 --> 55:31.043
That's all I have left.

55:31.112 --> 55:35.007
I'm, uh, stony broke.
Is that the phrase?

55:36.424 --> 55:38.529
It's a relief to admit it.

55:38.600 --> 55:43.390
- But your... your policy with Lloyds?
- Oh!

55:43.464 --> 55:46.628
You know how long it would take
to process an old claim like that?

55:46.696 --> 55:50.690
By the time I received it,
I'd be past needin' it.

55:50.760 --> 55:53.956
Well, now I think you're ready
for another cup of tea.

55:54.024 --> 55:56.064
Would you?

55:58.664 --> 56:03.171
<i>I hold two roses within my hand</i>

56:03.240 --> 56:07.877
<i>Two roses I give to you</i>

56:09.160 --> 56:12.509
<i>The red rose tells you</i>

56:12.585 --> 56:16.000
<i>Of my passion</i>

56:17.608 --> 56:20.292
<i>The white rose</i>

56:20.361 --> 56:24.932
<i>My love so true</i>

56:26.600 --> 56:31.554
<i>Hush, hush
sweet Charlotte</i>

56:31.625 --> 56:36.000
<i>Charlotte, don't you cry</i>

56:36.073 --> 56:40.328
<i>Hush, hush
sweet Charlotte</i>

56:40.392 --> 56:43.523
<i>I'll love you till I die</i>

56:45.417 --> 56:47.969
<i>And every night</i>

56:48.040 --> 56:51.717
<i>After I should die</i>

56:51.785 --> 56:54.054
<i>Yes, every night</i>

56:54.120 --> 56:57.502
<i>When I'm gone</i>

56:57.576 --> 57:03.010
<i>The wind will sing to you</i>

57:03.080 --> 57:06.047
<i>This lullaby</i>

57:07.784 --> 57:13.414
<i>Sweet Charlotte was loved</i>

57:14.664 --> 57:17.152
<i>ByJohn</i>

57:20.552 --> 57:22.624
Charlotte.

57:23.656 --> 57:25.696
Charlotte?

57:36.807 --> 57:39.589
Come. Come to bed, Charlotte.

57:43.335 --> 57:45.244
Come to bed.

57:46.663 --> 57:48.670
Miriam...

57:48.743 --> 57:51.558
he really... isn't here, is he?

57:53.031 --> 57:55.300
Just now I thought I heard...

57:58.791 --> 58:01.409
Sometimes at night
when I wake up...

58:02.918 --> 58:05.853
it seems as if he really is here.

58:07.975 --> 58:09.829
Don't turn on the light.

58:09.895 --> 58:12.797
It's not real when it's light.

58:14.727 --> 58:17.116
It's only real when it's dark...

58:19.783 --> 58:21.638
dark and still.

58:23.335 --> 58:25.374
I won't turn on the light.

58:25.447 --> 58:27.716
Come along.
You must go to bed.

58:46.983 --> 58:49.349
<i>He's dead.!</i>

58:50.439 --> 58:52.511
<i>He's dead.! He's dead.!</i>

58:52.582 --> 58:55.430
He's dead! He's dead!

58:55.495 --> 58:57.634
<i>- Dead! He's dead!
- Charlotte.!</i>

58:57.703 --> 58:59.972
<i>- No, no, he's all right.
- He's dead.!</i>

59:00.039 --> 59:02.559
He'll be fine.

59:02.631 --> 59:05.479
- He's dead! He's dead!
- Charlotte, don't...

01:00:37.511 --> 01:00:39.202
Stop starin' at me!

01:02:17.863 --> 01:02:21.692
Man, she sure acts...

01:02:21.766 --> 01:02:24.800
like she's crazy sometimes.

01:02:24.871 --> 01:02:27.588
That's what all the folks
in town say...

01:02:27.655 --> 01:02:29.510
but I wouldn't bet on it.

01:02:29.575 --> 01:02:31.549
I wouldn't bet on it at all.

01:02:46.886 --> 01:02:50.115
<i>Well, upon my word.</i>

01:02:52.742 --> 01:02:54.684
Charlotte Hollis.

01:02:56.678 --> 01:02:59.940
Now I've frightened you.
I'm terribly sorry.

01:03:05.638 --> 01:03:07.711
<i>Please don't run away.</i>

01:03:07.783 --> 01:03:10.271
I'm quite harmless, I assure you.

01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:24.060
Would you like a cigarette?

01:03:25.159 --> 01:03:27.014
Well, I won't either.

01:03:27.079 --> 01:03:29.053
What are you doing
on my property?

01:03:29.126 --> 01:03:32.160
Yes, my dear,
it is your property, isn't it?

01:03:32.231 --> 01:03:36.453
Well, as a matter of fact,
I'm snooping. There's no other word for it.

01:03:36.519 --> 01:03:38.886
- Are you one of the surveyors?
- Oh, no, no.

01:03:38.951 --> 01:03:40.739
I have nothing to do with
all that sort of thing.

01:03:40.740 --> 01:03:42.529
Then what's that camera for?

01:03:42.599 --> 01:03:47.236
This is a sort of conversation piece.

01:03:47.302 --> 01:03:50.237
I say, may I introduce myself?

01:03:50.311 --> 01:03:52.220
My name is Harry Wills.

01:03:56.774 --> 01:04:00.320
I've come all the way from London
in the hope of meeting you.

01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:02.365
Why?

01:04:02.439 --> 01:04:06.268
Well, we have met before,
you know...

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:08.285
a long time ago.

01:04:08.359 --> 01:04:10.912
<i>On the first night
you arrived in London...</i>

01:04:10.983 --> 01:04:13.317
<i>when I was a newspaper reporter...</i>

01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:16.830
and stood as close to you
as I am now...

01:04:16.903 --> 01:04:19.074
for two delightful minutes.

01:04:19.142 --> 01:04:20.997
But I didn't talk to any reporters.

01:04:21.062 --> 01:04:24.477
I know you didn't,
and you had every reason not to...

01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:26.405
the way they behaved toward you.

01:04:26.470 --> 01:04:29.853
That's one of the reasons
why I've always hoped I'd meet you again...

01:04:29.927 --> 01:04:32.065
to apologize.

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:34.982
- You really were there?
- Indeed I was.

01:04:35.047 --> 01:04:36.989
And I can prove it to you.

01:04:37.063 --> 01:04:39.267
Let me see now.

01:04:39.335 --> 01:04:41.571
You were dressed in, um...

01:04:41.638 --> 01:04:43.678
a sort of, uh...

01:04:43.750 --> 01:04:45.889
<i>gray... no, green...</i>

01:04:45.959 --> 01:04:49.188
<i>a green suit with a sort of...</i>

01:04:49.254 --> 01:04:51.261
<i>Tam-o'- Shanter to match.</i>

01:04:51.334 --> 01:04:53.439
<i>Am I right?</i>

01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:56.642
You see, I was there.

01:04:56.711 --> 01:05:01.566
You know, ever since that night I've read almost
everything they've ever printed about you.

01:05:01.638 --> 01:05:05.119
In fact, I'm quite
an authority on you.

01:05:05.190 --> 01:05:07.557
- You are?
- Yes, indeed I am.

01:05:08.647 --> 01:05:10.916
You're my favorite living mystery.

01:05:12.423 --> 01:05:14.430
Have you ever solved me?

01:05:14.503 --> 01:05:16.837
No.

01:05:16.902 --> 01:05:19.837
But then you wouldn't
be a mystery anymore, would you?

01:05:23.079 --> 01:05:24.988
No, I wouldn't.

01:05:26.662 --> 01:05:30.786
And I'm your... your favorite case
when you got so many to choose from?

01:05:30.854 --> 01:05:32.862
That's only natural.

01:05:32.935 --> 01:05:35.106
You have everything.

01:05:35.175 --> 01:05:38.819
You're unsolved.
Perhaps even insoluble.

01:05:38.886 --> 01:05:41.920
And you have passion
and glamour in your past.

01:05:41.991 --> 01:05:44.708
I say, I hope
I'm not offending you.

01:05:44.775 --> 01:05:47.263
It's the oddest thing.
You're not.

01:05:48.582 --> 01:05:50.884
I don't usually talk to people.

01:05:51.974 --> 01:05:54.396
Not about that.

01:05:54.471 --> 01:05:58.083
That's why I'm so flattered
that you're talking to me now.

01:05:58.151 --> 01:06:02.461
I say, let's go and sit up there
and have a nice little chat, shall we?

01:06:17.511 --> 01:06:19.366
Mr. Wills...

01:06:20.550 --> 01:06:22.786
since you're an authority on me...

01:06:24.454 --> 01:06:26.527
you think I'm a murderess?

01:06:27.975 --> 01:06:30.593
Do I look like one?

01:06:30.662 --> 01:06:33.477
Well, now, let's see.

01:06:34.918 --> 01:06:38.147
It's rather difficult, isn't it?
But that's as it should be.

01:06:40.295 --> 01:06:43.197
They've told you I'm crazy.

01:06:43.271 --> 01:06:45.921
<i>Everyone says you are.</i>

01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:47.900
<i>Are you?</i>

01:06:50.278 --> 01:06:52.700
I used to be positive I wasn't.

01:06:54.982 --> 01:06:57.154
But just lately...

01:06:58.726 --> 01:07:00.636
at night, it...

01:07:01.894 --> 01:07:04.065
it seems as if...

01:07:06.790 --> 01:07:08.765
I really don't know anymore.

01:07:08.839 --> 01:07:11.838
If it comes to that,
how does anyone know?

01:07:15.334 --> 01:07:17.505
Would you like to see
inside the house?

01:07:17.574 --> 01:07:20.574
<i>I've been wanting to see it for years.</i>

01:07:20.646 --> 01:07:22.556
<i>Come on.</i>

01:07:26.502 --> 01:07:29.437
Papa used to give the most
beautiful parties here.

01:07:29.511 --> 01:07:31.812
They went on for days and days.

01:07:31.879 --> 01:07:34.399
You're very fond
of this house, aren't you?

01:07:35.846 --> 01:07:38.846
I'll show you Papa's library.

01:07:38.918 --> 01:07:41.285
Papa built this place
up again, you know.

01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:44.252
He bought back a lot
of the original pieces.

01:07:44.326 --> 01:07:46.595
Oh.

01:07:46.662 --> 01:07:50.656
You're Miss Deering, aren't you?
I had the pleasure of seeing you yesterday.

01:07:50.727 --> 01:07:53.214
- My name is Wills. Harry Wills.
- How do you do?

01:07:53.286 --> 01:07:57.443
Your cousin's kindly considered
to show me around this lovely old home.

01:07:57.510 --> 01:07:59.419
I see.

01:07:59.494 --> 01:08:01.883
Excuse me.

01:08:01.958 --> 01:08:04.740
Come on.

01:08:04.806 --> 01:08:08.963
Papa's library was like a playroom
to me when I was a little bitty.

01:08:09.030 --> 01:08:11.964
That's Papa.
He never minded me underfoot.

01:08:12.038 --> 01:08:15.495
He never minded a thing I ever did.
He was always so...

01:08:15.622 --> 01:08:19.397
<i>Take your hands off that.!</i>

01:08:19.462 --> 01:08:21.850
You give that to me!

01:08:21.926 --> 01:08:24.609
Now you get out!
You get out, all of you!

01:08:24.678 --> 01:08:26.933
<i>Get out, do you hear me?
You get out and stay out!</i>

01:08:26.934 --> 01:08:28.060
<i>Go outside. Wait for me outside.</i>

01:08:28.134 --> 01:08:31.515
- You get out and stay out!
- Charlotte, what's the matter? What did they do?

01:08:31.590 --> 01:08:33.979
And you, too, snooping around.

01:08:34.054 --> 01:08:36.640
Don't you think I know
what you're looking for in my house?

01:08:36.711 --> 01:08:39.460
But what does it matter
if you haven't anything to conceal?

01:08:39.526 --> 01:08:44.229
Oh, but I have.
I have things concealed. Vile things.

01:08:44.295 --> 01:08:47.524
Where do you suppose I keep 'em?
Haven't you guessed?

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:49.444
In here.

01:08:49.510 --> 01:08:53.787
A memento of my sinful romance.
My lover's hand.

01:08:53.862 --> 01:08:56.993
Look! Just look!

01:09:11.046 --> 01:09:14.843
It's all... all I have
left of him.

01:09:16.518 --> 01:09:19.617
A love song he wrote for me...

01:09:19.685 --> 01:09:23.035
and gave me in a music box.

01:09:26.246 --> 01:09:29.093
My dear, Miss Charlotte. Please.

01:09:29.158 --> 01:09:32.322
- Oh, John.
- You better leave now.

01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:34.660
I was trying to help her.

01:09:34.725 --> 01:09:39.330
If you hadn't come here,
this might never have happened.

01:09:39.398 --> 01:09:41.308
I'm sorry.

01:09:43.207 --> 01:09:45.988
Who put that box in there?

01:09:46.054 --> 01:09:49.054
How in the world would I know?

01:10:26.534 --> 01:10:28.923
<i>Charlotte.</i>

01:10:50.598 --> 01:10:52.987
<i>Charlotte.</i>

01:11:22.598 --> 01:11:25.696
<i>Charlotte.</i>

01:11:28.038 --> 01:11:30.908
<i>Charlotte.</i>

01:11:32.710 --> 01:11:35.525
<i>Charlotte.</i>

01:11:37.638 --> 01:11:40.126
- John?

01:12:29.958 --> 01:12:32.478
- Charlotte?

01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:35.965
Charlotte? Charlotte, let me in.

01:12:45.894 --> 01:12:47.934
<i>The mirrors.</i>

01:12:48.006 --> 01:12:51.683
<i>Charlotte, what happened
to the mirrors?</i>

01:12:59.558 --> 01:13:01.924
- Charlotte...

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:04.062
what have you done?

01:13:13.446 --> 01:13:18.051
It was Papa.
He was so... so tall and so angry.

01:13:18.118 --> 01:13:20.257
He still hasn't forgiven me.

01:13:20.326 --> 01:13:23.759
No, Charlotte, he loved you.
He wouldn't have harmed you.

01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.476
But it was Papa.

01:13:25.542 --> 01:13:28.357
It was Papa.
I know it was.

01:13:28.422 --> 01:13:32.895
- No, it just seemed that way.
- He was there. He really was.

01:13:32.966 --> 01:13:35.387
- He really was.
- No, come along.

01:13:35.462 --> 01:13:37.699
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

01:13:42.054 --> 01:13:44.541
- Miriam, what are you doing?
- Charlotte.

01:13:44.614 --> 01:13:47.135
I'm taking you away
from here today.

01:13:47.206 --> 01:13:49.278
- No.
- Drew and I have talked it over.

01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:51.043
And we found a place where
you'll be real comfortable.

01:13:51.044 --> 01:13:52.033
No, I won't go.

01:13:52.101 --> 01:13:55.036
- You just get some sleep.
- You have to go before next Monday anyway.

01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:58.820
L... I won't go, not while
Jewel Mayhew's still down there.

01:13:58.886 --> 01:14:01.668
I won't have her see me
driven off my own place.

01:14:01.734 --> 01:14:04.571
Would you rather she sees you
arrested and taken off to jail?

01:14:04.572 --> 01:14:05.989
Luke Standish wouldn't do that.

01:14:06.054 --> 01:14:09.948
They'll be policemen and reporters
and photographers everywhere.

01:14:12.869 --> 01:14:15.684
Charlotte, after last night,
you must leave here.

01:14:15.749 --> 01:14:17.921
You must.

01:14:17.990 --> 01:14:21.251
- Last night?
- The music room.

01:14:21.318 --> 01:14:23.227
The mirrors.

01:14:31.302 --> 01:14:33.157
Where will you take me?

01:14:34.854 --> 01:14:37.537
To a nice place...

01:14:37.606 --> 01:14:39.810
where people will be kind to you.

01:14:39.878 --> 01:14:41.733
You'll see.

01:14:41.798 --> 01:14:46.108
But I won't go in the daytime. I won't go
till it's after dark 'causeJewel will see me.

01:14:46.182 --> 01:14:48.287
Now, Charlotte,
what difference does that make?

01:14:48.358 --> 01:14:50.300
Jewel will have to know
sooner or later.

01:14:50.374 --> 01:14:52.228
Now I want Charlotte
to get some sleep.

01:14:52.294 --> 01:14:54.879
I'll go downstairs and see about
cleaning up down there.

01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:58.528
- What are you gonna do to me?
- Now I want you to get all the rest you can.

01:14:58.597 --> 01:15:01.729
You're going to feel a lot better
after you've had a little sleep.

01:15:01.798 --> 01:15:05.311
Drew, I didn't break those mirrors.
Really, Drew, I didn't break those mirrors.

01:15:05.382 --> 01:15:08.582
Oh, of course
you didn't break the mirrors.

01:15:19.397 --> 01:15:21.699
Mr. Wills's room.

01:15:21.766 --> 01:15:23.653
Yeah. Will you hurry it up?

01:15:25.894 --> 01:15:28.577
Mr. Wills? Velma Cruther.

01:15:28.645 --> 01:15:32.191
- You told me to call you if...

01:15:35.142 --> 01:15:39.484
<i>Oh. I'll talk to you later.</i>

01:15:45.573 --> 01:15:47.548
I was just using the phone.

01:15:47.622 --> 01:15:49.531
So I see.

01:15:49.606 --> 01:15:52.061
Miss Charlotte will be
leaving tonight, Velma.

01:15:52.134 --> 01:15:55.101
You'll be given your wages
till the end of the month.

01:15:55.173 --> 01:15:58.043
You trying to hand me
my walkin' papers?

01:15:58.117 --> 01:16:01.117
No, it's just that
you won't be needed any longer.

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:03.491
Is that so?

01:16:03.557 --> 01:16:07.452
Well, what about when she comes back?
Or ain't she comin' back?

01:16:07.526 --> 01:16:11.355
Since the house won't be here,
I hardly think that's relevant.

01:16:11.430 --> 01:16:15.074
Oh, you think so, huh?
You know what I think?

01:16:15.141 --> 01:16:16.996
I think if she leaves
this house with you...

01:16:17.061 --> 01:16:19.843
she ain't never gonna be
seen nor heard from again.

01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:23.772
Anyways, I take my orders
from Miss Charlotte and not from you!

01:16:23.846 --> 01:16:25.700
It should be obvious,
even to you, Velma...

01:16:25.766 --> 01:16:28.253
that my cousin is in no condition
to run a household.

01:16:28.325 --> 01:16:32.864
Oh, is that so? Well, there's a whole lot
of things that's obvious to me.

01:16:34.662 --> 01:16:36.669
The childish tricks
you've been playing here...

01:16:36.742 --> 01:16:40.932
trying to frighten me into leaving are more
than sufficient reason to dismiss you.

01:16:40.997 --> 01:16:42.906
Tricks?

01:16:44.166 --> 01:16:47.199
What are you calling tricks?

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:50.117
Wasn't me that ripped
your dad-burned old dress.

01:16:50.182 --> 01:16:53.378
But you seem to know
it was ripped.

01:16:53.445 --> 01:16:55.901
And I haven't mentioned it to anyone.

01:16:56.965 --> 01:17:00.860
Besides, it isn't just the dress.

01:17:00.934 --> 01:17:03.868
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

01:17:03.941 --> 01:17:06.396
But I do know
one thing, though.

01:17:06.469 --> 01:17:10.495
You're just jealous because
Miss Charlotte always favored me!

01:17:10.565 --> 01:17:12.605
You're trying to dupe me
out of the money...

01:17:12.677 --> 01:17:15.841
that she promised me
when she passes away!

01:17:15.909 --> 01:17:19.422
Oh, that's charming.

01:17:21.350 --> 01:17:23.204
Quite charming.

01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:25.506
My cousin just happens
to be a little ill...

01:17:25.573 --> 01:17:28.443
and you're already
dividing up the spoils.

01:17:28.517 --> 01:17:30.819
I didn't mean it.

01:17:30.885 --> 01:17:34.562
I did not mean it that way,
and you damn well know it!

01:17:34.629 --> 01:17:39.136
Anyways, you don't have no call to be
so high and mighty.

01:17:39.205 --> 01:17:42.434
I seen all that fancy foreign mail
that you've been gettin'.

01:17:42.501 --> 01:17:45.436
You think I don't know a due bill
when I see one?

01:17:45.510 --> 01:17:47.931
You had it in for me since the first time
you come to this house.

01:17:48.005 --> 01:17:51.583
And you know why?
'Cause I can see right through you.

01:17:51.653 --> 01:17:55.101
You didn't fool me then,
and you sure as hell don't fool me now.

01:17:55.173 --> 01:17:58.588
My dear Velma,
I wouldn't dream of trying.

01:17:58.661 --> 01:18:02.403
But the point is you're fired.
You're just not needed any longer.

01:18:02.469 --> 01:18:04.957
Well, I'm not gonna clear out
just 'cause you say so.

01:18:05.029 --> 01:18:08.378
I've been lookin' after Miss Charlotte
since before you come here, and she knows it.

01:18:08.454 --> 01:18:10.723
Where do you think you're going?

01:18:10.789 --> 01:18:13.342
<i>I'm goin'upstairs, and I'm gonna tell her
what you've been up to.!</i>

01:18:13.413 --> 01:18:16.991
<i>Don't you dare go up there
and bother her.</i>

01:18:17.061 --> 01:18:19.166
Mm-hmm.

01:18:19.237 --> 01:18:22.914
What's going on up there
that you don't want me to see?

01:18:22.981 --> 01:18:25.981
<i>Now, Velma, Miss Miriam's
more than qualified...</i>

01:18:26.053 --> 01:18:27.963
to look after Miss Charlotte...

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:31.354
and to take care
of closing up the house.

01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:33.339
Oh.

01:18:34.693 --> 01:18:37.988
So you're in on this together, huh?

01:18:38.949 --> 01:18:40.804
You and her.

01:18:40.869 --> 01:18:43.771
You ought to be
ashamed of yourself.

01:18:43.845 --> 01:18:45.918
Miss Charlotte's sick.

01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:49.535
You're not gonna help her
get well by kicking up all this ruckus.

01:18:49.605 --> 01:18:51.515
Oh, all right!

01:18:52.485 --> 01:18:55.038
All right, I'm goin'.

01:18:55.109 --> 01:18:58.939
But don't think
you're not gonna be sorry!

01:18:59.013 --> 01:19:00.923
Both of you!

01:19:03.301 --> 01:19:07.262
What in the world does she think
we're gonna be sorry about?

01:19:07.333 --> 01:19:09.472
She's always been
insanely jealous...

01:19:09.542 --> 01:19:12.291
of anyone who was
close to Charlotte.

01:19:12.358 --> 01:19:15.521
I guess it's something
she just can't be rational about.

01:19:19.334 --> 01:19:21.537
You haven't got much
to go on, really.

01:19:21.606 --> 01:19:24.289
I got what I know, don't I?

01:19:24.357 --> 01:19:28.350
I know the state Miss Charlotte's been in
ever since that fool woman come here!

01:19:28.421 --> 01:19:30.723
She wouldn't have smashed
them mirrors that way...

01:19:30.789 --> 01:19:34.564
if somebody didn't have her good
and worked up about something.

01:19:34.629 --> 01:19:37.084
She loves that old house.

01:19:37.157 --> 01:19:39.012
She really does.

01:19:39.077 --> 01:19:43.201
Yes, but even allowing that there may be
some cause for concern...

01:19:45.062 --> 01:19:46.949
what can I do?

01:19:47.013 --> 01:19:48.868
You could do somethin'!

01:19:48.933 --> 01:19:51.038
She likes you.

01:19:51.109 --> 01:19:54.306
I seen how she was with you.

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:59.294
Now, if you was to...
if you was to go out there...

01:19:59.365 --> 01:20:02.496
and you were to tell her
not to listen to them...

01:20:02.565 --> 01:20:06.493
I think she'd mind what you say.

01:20:06.565 --> 01:20:09.380
I must admit, the whole thing
seems strangely odd to me.

01:20:09.445 --> 01:20:11.780
If they take my Miss Charlotte away
from that house...

01:20:11.845 --> 01:20:14.496
I ain't gonna never see her again.

01:20:14.566 --> 01:20:18.275
I knows it. I just knows it!

01:20:18.373 --> 01:20:21.242
You feeling all right, Charlotte?

01:20:21.317 --> 01:20:24.252
Somebody has to finish
your packing for you, don't they?

01:20:24.325 --> 01:20:27.641
You don't want to leave
all your things behind, do you?

01:20:27.717 --> 01:20:29.626
Do you?

01:20:54.182 --> 01:20:56.091
Papa.

01:21:00.165 --> 01:21:02.304
Papa, I'm going to have
to leave the house.

01:21:02.373 --> 01:21:06.529
I tried to keep the house,
but they're tearing it down.

01:21:06.597 --> 01:21:08.670
I can't help it.

01:21:11.013 --> 01:21:13.053
Don't be angry.

01:21:14.565 --> 01:21:17.500
I've lived alone here
all these years to protect you.

01:21:17.574 --> 01:21:19.516
You know that.

01:21:25.157 --> 01:21:28.834
Just because I loved John
more than I loved you...

01:21:28.901 --> 01:21:31.519
didn't give you the right
to murder him just to punish me!

01:21:36.613 --> 01:21:40.061
John never hurt you.
John never even...

01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:13.920
One more time, baby.

01:22:13.989 --> 01:22:17.884
Just one more time.
Nice. Now hold still.

01:22:17.957 --> 01:22:19.517
Once again.

01:22:19.589 --> 01:22:22.884
Thanks. Remind me to
send you one for Christmas.

01:22:34.949 --> 01:22:37.283
<i>Charlotte?</i>

01:22:38.693 --> 01:22:41.410
Charlotte? Charlotte, what is it?

01:23:13.317 --> 01:23:15.619
How is she?

01:23:15.685 --> 01:23:18.336
She'll keep. Oh.

01:23:18.405 --> 01:23:20.510
Wanna help me get rid of this?

01:23:23.973 --> 01:23:27.322
It's almost too real, isn't it?

01:23:27.397 --> 01:23:31.870
Your artist friend in New Orleans
has quite a talent.

01:23:31.941 --> 01:23:35.650
- And a minimum of curiosity.
- Do you think it's done the job?

01:23:35.717 --> 01:23:39.677
Not quite. We could probably achieve
the rest with this drug...

01:23:39.749 --> 01:23:41.986
but the effect
wouldn't be permanent.

01:23:42.053 --> 01:23:43.908
Besides, chemically it's traceable.

01:23:43.973 --> 01:23:46.788
Then we'll have to
go through with the rest?

01:23:46.853 --> 01:23:50.202
Don't you worry.
After the last phase of treatment...

01:23:50.277 --> 01:23:54.467
there won't be a doctor in Louisiana
who wouldn't commit her.

01:23:54.533 --> 01:23:58.362
Then establishing
your right to handle the estate...

01:23:58.437 --> 01:24:00.706
should take...

01:24:00.773 --> 01:24:03.490
oh, just a few days.

01:24:07.557 --> 01:24:09.662
Good morning, Charlotte.

01:24:12.357 --> 01:24:15.074
- Where's Velma?
- You let her go yesterday.

01:24:15.141 --> 01:24:17.050
You fired her.

01:24:18.565 --> 01:24:23.136
- Fired?
- You're not going to need her any longer.

01:24:23.205 --> 01:24:25.661
I had a terrible dream.

01:24:26.725 --> 01:24:28.635
- Terrible.
- I know.

01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:31.426
You'll stop having them
once you're away from here.

01:24:31.493 --> 01:24:33.981
Now you eat your breakfast.

01:24:35.845 --> 01:24:38.878
And I'll come back later
and see how you are.

01:25:55.397 --> 01:25:58.779
Miss Charlotte?

01:26:00.261 --> 01:26:02.301
<i>Miss Charlotte?</i>

01:26:11.973 --> 01:26:13.882
Miss Charlotte.

01:26:16.709 --> 01:26:19.392
What have they
been givin' you?

01:26:24.324 --> 01:26:26.910
That's some kind of drug, ain't it?

01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:32.320
Oh, Miss Charlotte.

01:26:32.389 --> 01:26:37.178
- I thought you'd gone.
- Well, I was gone. They kicked me out...

01:26:37.253 --> 01:26:41.115
Miss Miriam and your friend
Dr. Drew.

01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:44.931
I told that to Mr. Wills,
but he wouldn't listen.

01:26:44.997 --> 01:26:48.739
You can't go that way.
Miss Charlotte, I've gotta get your coat.

01:26:50.341 --> 01:26:53.189
Your shoes.
You can't go there.

01:26:53.253 --> 01:26:55.741
Come on, Miss Charlotte.
Come on, Miss Charlotte.

01:26:55.813 --> 01:26:57.820
I've gotta get you out of here.

01:26:57.893 --> 01:27:01.438
- Come on, honey. We gotta go outta here.

01:27:04.644 --> 01:27:07.033
Miss Charlotte. Come on, darling.

01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:09.793
Don't you say anything.
You hush now, ya hear?

01:27:09.861 --> 01:27:12.927
Don't you say a word.
Come on, Miss Charlotte.

01:27:14.629 --> 01:27:16.833
Miss Charlotte,
don't say anything. Shh.

01:27:16.901 --> 01:27:19.487
Shh. Be quiet.
Don't say anything.

01:27:22.661 --> 01:27:25.050
Oh, my!

01:27:25.125 --> 01:27:27.230
Shh, Miss Charlotte.

01:27:38.244 --> 01:27:40.448
You'll be able
to eat something later.

01:27:44.773 --> 01:27:47.139
I'll take this away.

01:27:47.205 --> 01:27:49.660
Is there anything you want
before I leave?

01:28:07.908 --> 01:28:10.210
I'll look in on you later.

01:28:23.141 --> 01:28:25.661
Now get some rest.

01:28:40.133 --> 01:28:42.402
Come on, Miss Charlotte.
You gotta wake up now. Come on.

01:28:42.468 --> 01:28:45.218
- No. No, Velma, no!
- Shh! You gotta be quiet, honey.

01:28:45.285 --> 01:28:48.765
Come on. Put your legs over here.
That's right.

01:28:48.836 --> 01:28:51.870
You gotta put this coat on.
Put your little hand in here now.

01:28:51.941 --> 01:28:54.559
Come on. Put your little hand
in there. That's right.

01:28:54.629 --> 01:28:57.018
Come on. Now give me
your other hand.

01:28:57.093 --> 01:28:59.427
That's good. Get it in there.

01:28:59.492 --> 01:29:01.827
<i>Come on. Give me your other one.</i>

01:29:09.733 --> 01:29:13.562
You just can't keep hogs
away from the trough, can you?

01:29:13.636 --> 01:29:15.491
I come to get my things.

01:29:15.556 --> 01:29:17.923
Is my cousin one of your things?

01:29:17.988 --> 01:29:21.022
I'm taking her outta here...

01:29:21.093 --> 01:29:22.881
<i>away from you.!</i>

01:29:22.949 --> 01:29:26.080
The only thing
you're taking out of here is you!

01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:28.538
Miss Charlotte! Miss Charlotte!

01:29:33.158 --> 01:29:37.762
So you're finally showin'
the right side of your face, ain't ya?

01:29:37.829 --> 01:29:40.447
Well, I seen it all the time.

01:29:40.517 --> 01:29:45.438
That's some kind of drug
that you've been givin' her.

01:29:45.509 --> 01:29:49.949
You've been makin' her act
the way she's been.

01:29:50.021 --> 01:29:52.574
Well, I'm goin' into town...

01:29:52.645 --> 01:29:56.704
and I'm goin' to tell them
what you been up to.

01:31:03.077 --> 01:31:06.306
Dr. Bayliss, please. Yes, Bayliss.

01:31:06.373 --> 01:31:09.570
And hurry. Please hurry.

01:31:09.637 --> 01:31:11.492
<i>Sit down.</i>

01:31:12.773 --> 01:31:15.904
You seem awfully nervous.

01:31:15.973 --> 01:31:19.868
He was always fighting
to keep two things...

01:31:19.941 --> 01:31:21.796
<i>his daughter and his money.</i>

01:31:21.861 --> 01:31:23.748
And now he's gonna lose both.

01:31:23.813 --> 01:31:27.326
Gotta hand it to him. He held on
to both of'em an awful long time...

01:31:27.397 --> 01:31:30.397
even after he died.

01:31:30.469 --> 01:31:34.626
I suppose in a way he's got Charlotte
to thank for that.

01:31:34.694 --> 01:31:37.083
If she hadn't deluded
herself into believing...

01:31:37.158 --> 01:31:42.308
it was dear old Papa
who killed John Mayhew...

01:31:42.374 --> 01:31:47.491
she might never have stayed here
guarding that so-called, uh, secret.

01:31:47.557 --> 01:31:50.557
She might have gone off
and spent the entire fortune.

01:31:50.629 --> 01:31:53.629
Are you sure it's all right?

01:31:53.701 --> 01:31:55.556
Sure what's all right?

01:31:55.621 --> 01:31:58.523
Don't make fun of me!

01:31:58.597 --> 01:32:01.793
Oh, you mean Velma.

01:32:01.861 --> 01:32:06.269
Of course it's all right. Nobody's ever
gonna know it wasn't an accident.

01:32:08.165 --> 01:32:10.915
Except me, of course.

01:32:10.981 --> 01:32:13.567
Which rather tends to make me
the senior partner...

01:32:13.638 --> 01:32:15.939
in our little enterprise,
doesn't it?

01:32:16.005 --> 01:32:19.354
Charlotte's still asleep.
Do you want me to give her anything else?

01:32:19.429 --> 01:32:24.131
No, no. She'll do
quite nicely as she is.

01:32:24.198 --> 01:32:28.158
Well, I'd better put in
an appearance in town.

01:32:30.597 --> 01:32:32.485
Oh, come on, Miriam.

01:32:32.549 --> 01:32:35.396
Don't start weakenin' now.

01:32:35.461 --> 01:32:38.527
This may be our last chance
of acquiring the wealth...

01:32:38.598 --> 01:32:41.347
to which I'd like
to become accustomed.

01:32:45.285 --> 01:32:47.194
See you.

01:32:56.261 --> 01:32:58.334
It's all yours, Mr. Wills.

01:32:58.406 --> 01:33:01.308
Thank you, Sheriff.

01:33:01.381 --> 01:33:04.283
Hi, Mr. Wills.
I'll bet this is the first time...

01:33:04.357 --> 01:33:08.154
you've ever seen the county coroner
operate out of a funeral parlor, eh?

01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:11.164
Yes. It's a bit different
where I come from.

01:33:11.237 --> 01:33:13.572
It's a bit different most places.

01:33:13.637 --> 01:33:17.117
Still, for a town of this size,
it's kind of handy.

01:33:17.189 --> 01:33:19.971
I just heard the news about
Velma Cruther's death...

01:33:20.038 --> 01:33:22.427
at the newspaper office.

01:33:22.501 --> 01:33:26.276
- It was Miss Cruther he came to see, wasn't it?
- Oh, yes, indeed, sir.

01:33:26.341 --> 01:33:29.757
She certainly had
a nasty accident, all right.

01:33:29.829 --> 01:33:33.691
- Would you like to see the body?
- No, thank you.

01:33:33.765 --> 01:33:36.799
Oh. Well, step inside anyway.

01:33:40.869 --> 01:33:43.324
May I ask how it happened?

01:33:43.397 --> 01:33:47.837
Well, it seems she, uh...
she fell off a ladder.

01:33:47.909 --> 01:33:50.975
She must have been
up there fixing her roof.

01:33:51.045 --> 01:33:54.558
The roof in her place
has always let in the rain.

01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:57.826
And, uh, well, it's done it for years.

01:33:57.893 --> 01:34:00.795
You mean this happened
at Miss Cruther's home?

01:34:00.869 --> 01:34:04.065
Well, I'd hardly
call it a home, sir...

01:34:04.133 --> 01:34:06.916
but she did fall in her own backyard.

01:34:06.981 --> 01:34:10.145
I see. Who found her?

01:34:10.214 --> 01:34:12.963
Well, I couldn't tell you that, sir...

01:34:13.029 --> 01:34:16.063
but it was Dr. Bayliss
that brought her in.

01:34:42.981 --> 01:34:48.644
Charlotte.

01:34:48.710 --> 01:34:53.117
Charlotte.

01:34:54.949 --> 01:35:00.666
Charlotte.

01:35:01.893 --> 01:35:05.189
Charlotte.

01:35:07.781 --> 01:35:11.097
Hush, hush
sweet Charlotte

01:35:11.173 --> 01:35:15.068
<i>Charlotte, don't you cry</i>

01:35:17.221 --> 01:35:20.537
Hush, hush
sweet Charlotte

01:35:21.797 --> 01:35:25.692
<i>I'll love you till I die</i>

01:35:28.549 --> 01:35:31.484
<i>Oh, hold me, darlin'</i>

01:35:31.557 --> 01:35:33.979
<i>Please hold me close</i>

01:35:34.053 --> 01:35:36.442
<i>And brush the tears</i>

01:35:36.517 --> 01:35:39.234
<i>From your eyes</i>

01:35:39.301 --> 01:35:44.451
<i>You weep because
you had a dream last night</i>

01:35:44.517 --> 01:35:48.673
<i>You dreamed
that I said good-bye</i>

01:35:50.406 --> 01:35:54.715
<i>Hush, hush
sweet Charlotte</i>

01:35:54.789 --> 01:35:58.684
<i>Charlotte, don't you cry</i>

01:36:04.869 --> 01:36:06.778
<i>Charlotte.</i>

01:36:09.701 --> 01:36:12.068
John?

01:36:14.821 --> 01:36:17.887
John, wait! Don't go.

01:36:22.981 --> 01:36:25.567
<i>Hush, hush
sweet Charlotte</i>

01:36:26.757 --> 01:36:31.099
<i>Charlotte, don't you cry</i>

01:36:38.021 --> 01:36:39.482
John?

01:36:46.149 --> 01:36:48.004
John?

01:40:32.069 --> 01:40:33.978
John?

01:40:35.301 --> 01:40:37.341
Don't go away.

01:40:40.165 --> 01:40:41.987
John?

01:40:43.205 --> 01:40:45.693
Please don't go away!

01:41:26.949 --> 01:41:28.858
Papa?

01:41:42.149 --> 01:41:44.004
Charlotte.

01:41:48.581 --> 01:41:50.436
John.

01:43:33.188 --> 01:43:35.261
You idiot.

01:43:35.333 --> 01:43:37.252
You wretched idiot!

01:43:38.979 --> 01:43:41.881
He's dead.

01:43:43.139 --> 01:43:45.311
And you killed him.

01:43:55.236 --> 01:43:57.276
Miriam!

01:43:57.348 --> 01:43:59.868
Miriam!

01:43:59.939 --> 01:44:03.354
Don't call the sheriff.

01:44:03.427 --> 01:44:05.499
People staring at me
and hating me.

01:44:05.571 --> 01:44:08.222
It will be just like the night
when John was murdered.

01:44:08.291 --> 01:44:11.291
But you killed Drew.
We can't just pretend it never happened.

01:44:11.363 --> 01:44:14.745
You don't know what it's like when hate
is everywhere. You can't feel it.

01:44:14.819 --> 01:44:16.794
Oh, Miriam,
don't you hate me too.

01:44:16.867 --> 01:44:19.834
Oh, please, Charlotte.
Please, please don't.

01:44:19.907 --> 01:44:23.584
I didn't mean to kill him.
The gun was just there in-in my hand.

01:44:23.651 --> 01:44:26.335
And-And when I saw him,
he looked so horrible.

01:44:26.404 --> 01:44:29.753
It was just like the night when...
when the mirrors were all smashed...

01:44:29.827 --> 01:44:32.162
and just like the night
when I saw that hand.

01:44:32.227 --> 01:44:37.409
Oh, Miriam... Miriam, please don't call
the sheriff. I just couldn't stand it!

01:44:37.476 --> 01:44:40.323
Oh, Charlotte, don't.

01:44:40.387 --> 01:44:43.387
We could get rid of the body.
We could hide it somewhere.

01:44:43.459 --> 01:44:47.518
Then people would think someone else
had done it. That's the only thing to do.

01:44:47.587 --> 01:44:49.921
Miriam... Miriam,
I've got lots of money.

01:44:52.259 --> 01:44:54.648
<i>I'll give it to you, all of it.</i>

01:44:54.723 --> 01:44:57.658
<i>We really could get rid
of the body if you'd help me.</i>

01:44:57.732 --> 01:44:59.968
We could get rid of it
if you'd help me.

01:45:04.708 --> 01:45:08.799
- Oh, I wish to God I'd never come here.

01:45:17.315 --> 01:45:21.276
I'll get the car. You turn out the lights.

01:45:21.347 --> 01:45:23.551
Well, go!

01:45:30.980 --> 01:45:33.762
- Get in there and stay quiet.

01:45:33.827 --> 01:45:36.031
Get in there!

01:45:43.651 --> 01:45:47.394
Miss Deering, I hope you'll forgive me
for popping in at this time.

01:45:47.459 --> 01:45:50.754
<i>I happened to be out driving
with a friend when I noticed the lights.</i>

01:45:50.819 --> 01:45:54.365
I've heard the news about
Velma Cruther's death.

01:45:59.555 --> 01:46:02.719
<i>What a terrible thing.
She was such a loyal person.</i>

01:46:04.387 --> 01:46:07.169
<i>I'm quite sure Miss Hollis
must be terribly upset about it.</i>

01:46:07.235 --> 01:46:09.657
<i>I wonder if there's anything I can do?</i>

01:46:09.731 --> 01:46:12.798
It's very kind of you,
but, no, there isn't anything.

01:46:12.868 --> 01:46:14.907
<i>Charlotte was upset.</i>

01:46:14.979 --> 01:46:19.038
<i>I've given her a sedative
and put her to bed.</i>

01:46:19.107 --> 01:46:21.474
<i>- It was a dreadful shock for her.
- I'm terribly sorry.</i>

01:46:21.539 --> 01:46:23.644
<i>Please give her my sympathy.</i>

01:46:23.715 --> 01:46:26.104
<i>I'm sorry I can't ask you in.</i>

01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:28.568
It's quite all right.
I shouldn't have come.

01:46:28.643 --> 01:46:31.774
It's very late. I just happened
to be passing, that was all.

01:46:31.843 --> 01:46:33.057
You understand.

01:46:33.058 --> 01:46:35.487
Yes, of course. Thank you, Mr. Wills.
Good night.

01:46:35.556 --> 01:46:39.647
Uh, by the way,
I understand you'll be leaving...

01:46:39.715 --> 01:46:42.136
<i>this house in a matter of days now,
you and your cousin.</i>

01:46:42.211 --> 01:46:46.434
<i>Well, of course our plans
are indefinite now.</i>

01:46:46.499 --> 01:46:48.354
<i>Naturally, they would be.</i>

01:46:48.419 --> 01:46:51.736
<i>Mr. Wills,
you'll have to excuse me.</i>

01:46:51.811 --> 01:46:53.819
I must look in on Charlotte.

01:46:53.891 --> 01:46:56.347
Excuse me, please.
Good night.

01:46:56.419 --> 01:46:59.736
<i>Good night.</i>

01:47:36.995 --> 01:47:39.068
I don't think I can help you.

01:47:40.995 --> 01:47:43.613
<i>You can't help me?</i>

01:47:43.683 --> 01:47:46.050
I'm the one that's helping you!

01:47:46.115 --> 01:47:47.970
Do you want me to wash my hands
of the whole thing?

01:47:48.035 --> 01:47:51.418
Call the sheriff?
Is that what you want?

01:47:51.491 --> 01:47:54.459
Well, all right, then.

01:48:07.811 --> 01:48:10.681
<i>Hey, turn your lights on.!</i>

01:48:29.059 --> 01:48:32.375
I must be the worst person
in the world...

01:48:32.451 --> 01:48:34.393
to have killed Drew.

01:48:34.467 --> 01:48:36.888
Will you please shut up?

01:48:47.971 --> 01:48:50.273
Miriam, I-I can't touch him.

01:49:05.123 --> 01:49:08.538
- Don't make me do it, Miriam.
- Get out!

01:49:14.243 --> 01:49:16.480
Do what I say!

01:49:42.499 --> 01:49:44.834
Well?

01:50:32.003 --> 01:50:34.425
Will you stop that!

01:50:37.155 --> 01:50:39.522
Miriam, they'll... they'll be
finding him soon...

01:50:39.587 --> 01:50:41.562
and-and they'll be asking questions...

01:50:41.635 --> 01:50:44.766
and I-I-I don't think
I-I could lie to 'em.

01:50:44.835 --> 01:50:47.835
You-You-You... You'll have...
You'll have to tell 'em, Miriam...

01:50:47.907 --> 01:50:50.208
I'm not able to answer questions.

01:50:50.275 --> 01:50:54.338
'Cause they'll find out if you don't.
They'll find out, Miriam.

01:51:08.866 --> 01:51:11.102
Damn you!

01:51:11.169 --> 01:51:14.944
Now will you shut your mouth?

01:51:16.929 --> 01:51:18.784
You'll do as I tell you.

01:51:18.849 --> 01:51:22.624
And if I tell you to lie,
you'll do that too.

01:51:22.689 --> 01:51:26.683
I'm never going to suffer
for you again.

01:51:26.754 --> 01:51:29.088
Not ever.

01:51:29.153 --> 01:51:31.935
Do you understand?

01:52:01.314 --> 01:52:03.168
Get out.

01:52:03.234 --> 01:52:05.819
<i>Get out and go up to your room.</i>

01:52:05.889 --> 01:52:07.799
Go ahead!

01:52:11.138 --> 01:52:13.789
<i>I'm going to clean out the back,
and I'll be up in a minute.</i>

01:52:13.858 --> 01:52:15.581
Well, go on!

01:53:33.890 --> 01:53:35.930
<i>Go up to your room.</i>

01:53:36.002 --> 01:53:38.173
<i>Well, go on.!</i>

01:53:38.242 --> 01:53:41.242
<i>Go on.! Go on.!</i>

01:55:00.321 --> 01:55:02.558
Hush...

01:55:02.625 --> 01:55:05.821
hush, sweet Charlotte.

01:55:47.457 --> 01:55:49.912
I'm sorry to have
kept you waiting.

01:55:51.105 --> 01:55:53.407
To your very good health.

01:55:53.473 --> 01:55:56.026
- You look absolutely ravishing.
- Thank you, sir.

01:55:56.097 --> 01:55:59.097
I bet Lazarus never felt
as good as I do.

01:55:59.169 --> 01:56:01.176
To Venice in the spring.

01:56:01.249 --> 01:56:03.071
Venice?

01:56:03.137 --> 01:56:06.137
Well, as a matter of fact,
I'm not certain...

01:56:06.209 --> 01:56:08.860
that I shall want to live in Europe.

01:56:10.209 --> 01:56:12.064
I don't see that what you want...

01:56:12.129 --> 01:56:14.366
has anything to do
with where we go.

01:56:14.433 --> 01:56:18.361
You forget that Velma's tragic departure...

01:56:18.433 --> 01:56:23.190
has allowed me to become
the senior partner of our little enterprise.

01:56:23.265 --> 01:56:26.843
Are you sure you have the brains
to be the senior partner?

01:56:28.129 --> 01:56:30.879
I, uh, don't think I follow you.

01:56:32.577 --> 01:56:35.544
Who do you suppose
helped to set up cousin Charlotte...

01:56:35.617 --> 01:56:39.294
for this little comedy by sending
her all those charming notes?

01:56:39.361 --> 01:56:41.663
Well, naturallyJewel Mayhew.

01:56:41.729 --> 01:56:43.737
Jewel?

01:56:43.809 --> 01:56:46.875
Jewel Mayhew hasn't done a thing
in years and years...

01:56:46.945 --> 01:56:50.655
except keep me in comfort
until her money ran out.

01:56:53.697 --> 01:56:55.802
I sent Charlotte all those notes.

01:56:55.873 --> 01:56:57.783
You...

01:56:58.753 --> 01:57:00.826
And Jewel Mayhew?

01:57:09.729 --> 01:57:12.958
My notes toJewel had
a more practical purpose.

01:57:13.026 --> 01:57:16.954
The one good thing that ever happened
to me in this house...

01:57:17.025 --> 01:57:21.564
was seeing Jewel Mayhew
go out to the summerhouse that night.

01:57:24.385 --> 01:57:27.069
She paid me handsomely
for that indiscretion.

01:57:32.769 --> 01:57:34.624
<i>She paid you?</i>

01:57:48.802 --> 01:57:53.624
Jewel murdered her husband,
and you could actually bring yourself...

01:57:53.698 --> 01:57:58.269
to make both her and Charlotte
suffer for it all these years?

01:57:58.337 --> 01:58:00.442
Yes, darling.

01:58:00.513 --> 01:58:02.685
That's exactly what I did.

01:58:02.753 --> 01:58:05.404
<i>Do you still feel
you have the imagination...</i>

01:58:05.474 --> 01:58:08.124
<i>to be the senior member
of this partnership?</i>

01:58:12.065 --> 01:58:14.367
<i>Evidently not.</i>

01:58:16.386 --> 01:58:20.412
<i>I didn't know you had
such a dulcet baritone.</i>

01:58:20.482 --> 01:58:23.798
<i>Well, you attended the wrong Sunday school
when I was a choirboy.</i>

01:58:23.873 --> 01:58:26.720
<i>So, you see, my dear...</i>

01:58:26.785 --> 01:58:29.054
you've joined this game
somewhat later than you thought.

01:58:29.122 --> 01:58:31.227
I did indeed.

01:58:31.298 --> 01:58:33.599
If you'd known earlier,
would you have trusted me...

01:58:33.666 --> 01:58:35.869
<i>not to put real bullets
in that gun tonight?</i>

01:58:35.937 --> 01:58:39.832
<i>No, ma'am, Miss Miriam.
I don't believe I would.</i>

01:58:41.921 --> 01:58:45.947
I would be careful
not to over-celebrate too soon.

01:58:46.017 --> 01:58:49.530
We've still got one more show
to put on first thing in the morning.

01:58:49.601 --> 01:58:51.740
- So early?
- Yes.

01:58:51.810 --> 01:58:54.744
<i>I asked the folks from the state institution
to come over here about 10:00.</i>

01:58:54.817 --> 01:58:57.239
You mean I shall have
to wring my hands...

01:58:57.314 --> 01:58:59.866
in abject misery
and humiliation...

01:58:59.937 --> 01:59:04.029
at the disgrace of having a member
of our fine old family...

01:59:04.097 --> 01:59:06.169
committed to
the local madhouse?

01:59:06.241 --> 01:59:08.183
Fine old family, indeed.

01:59:08.257 --> 01:59:12.665
Sam Hollis was nothing but
a thieving, fat fraud. And...

01:59:16.418 --> 01:59:18.360
<i>- And furthermore...</i>

01:59:18.434 --> 01:59:20.986
<i>he and John Mayhew...</i>

01:59:21.057 --> 01:59:24.440
<i>were the biggest
two damn womanizers...</i>

01:59:24.513 --> 01:59:27.360
<i>in the whole state of Louisiana.</i>

01:59:27.425 --> 01:59:29.280
Oh, dear, all that lovely money...

01:59:29.345 --> 01:59:32.215
that Big Sam sweated
to get his hands on.

01:59:32.289 --> 01:59:34.144
While we're spending it
like water...

01:59:34.209 --> 01:59:37.951
Charlotte will be weaving lots
and lots of little baskets.

01:59:38.017 --> 01:59:40.635
Oh, don't distress yourself, darling.

01:59:40.705 --> 01:59:43.967
There's nothing wrong
with basket weaving.

01:59:44.033 --> 01:59:47.067
<i>Of course,
it never cured anybody...</i>

01:59:47.138 --> 01:59:49.658
but it is most therapeutic.

01:59:51.938 --> 01:59:56.029
I can just see Charlotte's face
when those doctors at the institution...

01:59:56.097 --> 02:00:00.058
<i>call you in
to confirm their opinion.</i>

02:00:00.129 --> 02:00:03.958
<i>When she sees me
walk in there tomorrow morning...</i>

02:00:04.033 --> 02:00:07.808
<i>she'll let out such a scream
that they'll never let her out.</i>

02:00:43.649 --> 02:00:45.951
The way I heard it,
that Deering woman...

02:00:46.017 --> 02:00:49.846
didn't have nothin'
but a flimsy peekaboo dress on.

02:00:49.921 --> 02:00:53.816
Yeah, me too. I heard that.
She and that Dr. Drew...

02:00:53.889 --> 02:00:56.572
you didn't have to guess
what was going on there.

02:00:56.641 --> 02:00:58.496
Ya ask me...

02:00:58.561 --> 02:01:00.863
you go to live with
a bloodthirsty maniac...

02:01:00.929 --> 02:01:03.580
you're just asking for it.

02:01:03.649 --> 02:01:06.104
She went on a real rampage.

02:01:06.177 --> 02:01:10.039
I'll bet they'll never pin it on her,
just like back before.

02:01:10.113 --> 02:01:13.626
Martha! Dora!
Ooh, whee, is this a day.

02:01:13.697 --> 02:01:17.144
People dropping like flies
every which way.

02:01:17.217 --> 02:01:19.257
What happened?

02:01:19.329 --> 02:01:20.936
Well, what, Nellie?

02:01:20.937 --> 02:01:24.151
You won't never in this world
believe it, but it's so.

02:01:24.225 --> 02:01:28.382
Jewel Mayhew... And I know
because I got it straight from Bessie...

02:01:28.449 --> 02:01:30.303
- What? What?
- What happened?

02:01:30.369 --> 02:01:32.943
Jewel Mayhew just went
and dropped dead this morning.

02:01:32.944 --> 02:01:34.231
Oh, no.

02:01:34.305 --> 02:01:36.792
She had her third stroke
and she was gone...

02:01:36.865 --> 02:01:39.102
before they even got
the doctor on the phone.

02:01:39.169 --> 02:01:42.584
- No!
- And just guess what brought it on.

02:01:42.657 --> 02:01:44.184
- What?
- What?

02:01:44.257 --> 02:01:47.902
It was when she heard what happened
over here last night.

02:02:07.937 --> 02:02:11.232
Isn't that the most
extraordinary thing?

02:02:11.297 --> 02:02:12.922
What is?

02:02:12.993 --> 02:02:16.571
It was just a thought.
But suppose it was Jewel Mayhew...

02:02:16.641 --> 02:02:21.180
who really murdered
her husband back in '27.

02:02:21.249 --> 02:02:24.063
And supposing there was
a witness to the murder.

02:02:24.129 --> 02:02:26.103
So?

02:02:26.177 --> 02:02:29.144
That would explain why
she didn't try to collect...

02:02:29.217 --> 02:02:31.389
on her husband's insurance.

02:02:31.457 --> 02:02:36.061
She was afraid a routine investigation
might reveal her guilt...

02:02:36.129 --> 02:02:38.016
thus enabling the witness...

02:02:38.081 --> 02:02:40.950
<i>to take advantage ofher silence
and blackmail her...</i>

02:02:42.177 --> 02:02:44.217
bleeding her white.

02:02:45.344 --> 02:02:47.199
What does that give you?

02:02:47.264 --> 02:02:50.331
Well, it would at least give us...

02:02:50.401 --> 02:02:54.110
the timing ofJewel Mayhew's death and...

02:02:54.177 --> 02:02:59.228
all this sort of bizarre irony,
wouldn't it?

02:02:59.297 --> 02:03:01.304
Hey, you're not kidding, are you?

02:03:01.377 --> 02:03:05.174
It would mean that Charlotte Hollis
has suffered all her life...

02:03:05.249 --> 02:03:07.354
for a murder
she hadn't committed.

02:03:07.424 --> 02:03:11.832
- You mean that's true?
- How should I know, old chap?

02:03:11.905 --> 02:03:13.760
I'm just guessing.

02:03:13.825 --> 02:03:16.542
Merely speculating, that's all.

02:03:19.585 --> 02:03:21.756
<i>Here she comes now.</i>

02:03:27.425 --> 02:03:31.003
<i>- It's Charlotte Hollis.
- Look. There she goes.</i>

02:04:11.329 --> 02:04:14.907
- Here she comes.
- Hey, Miss Hollis, over here.

02:04:17.504 --> 02:04:19.708
Now give me another one.

02:04:20.833 --> 02:04:23.037
Thank you, Miss Hollis.

02:04:25.217 --> 02:04:27.705
Can I have one too, Miss Hollis?

02:04:30.592 --> 02:04:33.243
<i>She looks right pretty, don't she?</i>

02:04:35.584 --> 02:04:39.032
Sometimes they got their sane moments,
just like you or me.

02:04:39.104 --> 02:04:41.853
<i>Maybe so, but you ain't seen Dr. Drew...</i>

02:04:41.921 --> 02:04:44.604
<i>or that Deering woman lying in there.</i>

02:04:44.672 --> 02:04:47.323
<i>Oh, she has to be crazy as a loon.</i>

02:04:58.464 --> 02:05:00.919
- I wouldn't wanna be in her shoes.
- Y'all step back.

02:05:00.992 --> 02:05:02.847
All right,
let's move back, everybody.

02:05:02.912 --> 02:05:05.814
Miss Hollis, this letter's for you.

02:05:05.888 --> 02:05:09.183
I think you've been waiting
a long time for it.

02:05:12.224 --> 02:05:14.526
Sorry. Everybody has to move back.

02:05:48.192 --> 02:05:50.810
<i>Okay, let's go.</i>

02:05:53.888 --> 02:05:56.539
<i>Step back.</i>

02:05:56.608 --> 02:05:59.095
- Stop pushing!
- Get back over there!

02:06:26.368 --> 02:06:29.401
<i>Hush, hush, sweet Charlotte</i>

02:06:30.816 --> 02:06:34.427
<i>Charlotte, don't you cry</i>

02:06:35.616 --> 02:06:40.504
<i>Hush, hush
sweet Charlotte</i>

02:06:40.576 --> 02:06:45.148
<i>I'll love you till I die</i>

02:06:46.720 --> 02:06:49.982
<i>Hush, hush
sweet Charlotte</i>

02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:55.734
<i>Charlotte, don't you cry</i>

02:06:57.312 --> 02:07:01.622
<i>Hush, hush
sweet Charlotte</i>

02:07:01.696 --> 02:07:03.736
<i>I'll love you</i>

02:07:03.808 --> 02:07:08.990
<i>Till I die</i>
