02:09.360 --> 02:10.554
Family--

02:10.800 --> 02:13.678
And l use that term
with great embarrassment.

02:14.360 --> 02:20.390
--it is now time to unveil the contents
of the Bundy family Christmas club.

02:20.840 --> 02:22.512
Oh, Dad.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.796
You got a festive green one
this year.

02:25.040 --> 02:28.157
Usually you just use one
of your old white socks.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.712
Honey, that is one
of his white socks.

02:31.960 --> 02:34.633
See how it matches his teeth.

02:35.240 --> 02:38.710
Thank you,
Rudolf the Redhead Couch Wit.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.391
Anyway, once a year...

02:41.640 --> 02:44.154
...the working members
of the Bundy family, namely me...

02:44.360 --> 02:46.920
...put aside a small percentage
of his paycheque--

02:47.160 --> 02:49.151
Namely nothing.

02:49.400 --> 02:52.870
--and at the end of the year,
opens it up to buy Christmas presents.

02:53.120 --> 02:55.111
Namely garbage.

02:55.360 --> 02:58.432
Dad, why do we go through
this pathetic charade every year?

02:58.680 --> 03:02.468
You know Mom's jimmied the lock
and spent all the money on herself.

03:03.000 --> 03:06.390
l didn't spend one penny
on myself this year.

03:06.640 --> 03:09.791
Hey, maybe,
we will get some presents.

03:10.280 --> 03:13.829
Then why is there nothing
but receipts in here, Peg?

03:14.080 --> 03:15.308
Well, those aren't from me.

03:15.560 --> 03:17.198
That's just stuff Mom needed.

03:17.440 --> 03:20.716
Five hundred dollars
for JJ's House of Strudel.

03:21.480 --> 03:25.155
Two hundred dollars
for a heavy-duty Buttmaster.

03:25.400 --> 03:29.234
Everybody knows that strudel
goes straight to the butt.

03:29.480 --> 03:32.358
-There goes your Christmas gift, Peg.
-What about us?

03:32.600 --> 03:35.239
Oh, this doesn't affect
your gift, pumpkin.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.711
Merry Christmas.

03:43.400 --> 03:46.631
Merry Christmas. l ought to give you
one of these for Christmas.

03:49.680 --> 03:52.274
Come on, Kel. Let's go.

03:52.680 --> 03:55.240
We'll have to raise our own money
for Christmas presents.

03:55.440 --> 03:56.873
You know what this means, right?

03:57.080 --> 03:59.640
Yeah. The shell-shocked vet
and the blind-girl routine.

03:59.840 --> 04:01.796
That's right.

04:03.040 --> 04:06.919
And this year don't sit there
reading People magazine, all right.

04:08.400 --> 04:13.076
l was not reading it.
l was looking at the pictures, okay?

04:14.960 --> 04:16.951
Your mother's eating us
out of house and home.

04:17.160 --> 04:20.630
l don't expect her to pull her weight.
That would be impossible.

04:21.000 --> 04:22.274
But she's got to get a job.

04:22.520 --> 04:25.512
She's a Wanker woman.
She's not used to working.

04:25.760 --> 04:29.833
l will only put up with one worthless
Wanker woman in this house at a time.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.230
Either she gets a job or you do.

04:33.800 --> 04:36.473
Mom, we gotta talk!

04:44.400 --> 04:47.551
Excuse me.
Do you have any pumps in my size?

04:47.800 --> 04:51.076
Yes, l do, but the Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Shoes...

04:51.320 --> 04:53.276
...would not allow me
to sell them to you.

04:53.880 --> 04:57.350
Well, l hope you get coal
in your stocking on Christmas morning.

04:57.640 --> 05:01.189
And l hope you get Slim-Fast
in yours.

05:01.800 --> 05:03.836
Now, we're about to have
our Christmas party.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.071
So would you mind eggnogging
on out?

05:07.000 --> 05:10.072
-Happy Holidays.
-Merry Christmas.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.914
Hey, guys, sorry l'm late.

05:18.320 --> 05:22.108
l had to ditch Marcie down
at the employment office.

05:22.600 --> 05:24.795
God, what a depressing place.

05:25.040 --> 05:26.598
All those people out of work, huh?

05:26.800 --> 05:28.552
No. All those people looking
for work.

05:29.920 --> 05:32.275
Have they no pride?

05:33.120 --> 05:36.829
l'll tell you, if Marcie is so dead set
on a two-income family...

05:37.080 --> 05:39.435
...let her get a night job.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.512
Yeah.

05:47.440 --> 05:51.718
Jefferson, you don't really mean that
about Marcie, do you?

05:51.960 --> 05:56.351
As sure as l'm skimming money
off her mutual funds.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.719
Oh, l'll tell you,
it will be a cold day in hell...

06:00.920 --> 06:03.878
...when my paycheque-in-heels
outsmarts me.

06:04.840 --> 06:09.356
Well, then, prepare to make snow
angels with the Prince of Darkness.

06:11.920 --> 06:13.478
Marcie?

06:14.600 --> 06:19.230
Marcie! l can't believe you followed me
here from the employment office?

06:19.480 --> 06:22.313
-Look, Jefferson--
-Oh, no, no, no. Don't apologize.

06:22.520 --> 06:24.511
The damage is done.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.472
Look, Marcie,
if l can't trust you not to follow me...

06:31.720 --> 06:34.837
...how can l ever trust you
as a reference on a job application?

06:35.080 --> 06:37.548
Well, l already got you a job...

06:37.800 --> 06:42.032
...playing life-sized Ken in the Barbie
Christmas window at Marshall Field's.

06:48.000 --> 06:52.039
Okay, but don't blame me, Marcie,
if your sick obsession with work...

06:52.240 --> 06:54.708
...drives me into the arms
of a life-sized Barbie.

06:54.960 --> 06:56.473
Merry Christmas.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.511
Merry Christmas!

06:58.760 --> 07:01.479
Well, now that the wives
and deadbeats are gone...

07:01.680 --> 07:03.398
...let's start this Christmas party.

07:03.640 --> 07:06.598
Yeah! Yeah! The tree is trimmed,
the halls are decked...

07:06.800 --> 07:09.951
...and lke has dawned
his gay apparel.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.989
Take that back,
you glorified night watchman.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.949
Gentlemen, focus.
There'll be no brawling here.

07:19.160 --> 07:21.469
This is a Christmas party,
not a wedding.

07:22.840 --> 07:26.879
Besides, we can't start until Griff
gets here from his new part-time job.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.030
Okay, kid,
if you let go of my leg...

07:38.240 --> 07:41.277
...l'll bring you a pony
on Christmas morning.

07:42.320 --> 07:43.958
Excuse me.
Why did you say that?

07:44.200 --> 07:46.350
l specifically told you
he couldn't have one.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.230
And l specifically told you
tips were encouraged.

07:50.640 --> 07:53.552
Come on, Bobby.
The real Santa's at Kmart.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.756
-Merry Christmas!
-Happy holidays!

07:55.960 --> 07:58.599
Merry stinking Christmas.

07:58.840 --> 08:02.310
Hey, Griff,
where's your Christmas spirit?

08:02.560 --> 08:06.519
My ex-wife got it
in the divorce settlement.

08:07.040 --> 08:08.758
Along with the house, the car...

08:08.960 --> 08:12.236
...and my entire collection
of Pam Grier movies.

08:13.040 --> 08:16.237
l knew you were feeling lonely
the last couple of weeks.

08:16.440 --> 08:18.829
That's why l got you
this for Christmas.

08:19.920 --> 08:22.514
'' 1 -900-YUMMY''?

08:24.480 --> 08:30.237
''The bearer of this card is entitled
to 20 minutes of yuletide phone sex.''

08:31.280 --> 08:35.193
-Al, you shouldn't have.
-Hey, it didn't cost me anything.

08:35.400 --> 08:39.109
l just cashed in my frequent
hooter miles at the nudie bar.

08:43.400 --> 08:48.679
Al, meaningless, no-strings-attached
sex is the last thing l want right now.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.753
That's the only thing l've ever wanted.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.999
-Oh, wait!
-Let me have it.

08:55.200 --> 08:57.794
Hey, lke, give me that thing back.
Come on, lke!

08:58.040 --> 09:00.235
Hey, lke! lke! lke!

09:00.480 --> 09:03.313
Don't be selfish.
Put it on the speakerphone.

09:08.200 --> 09:11.988
Hello, you're cooking with Butter.

09:16.640 --> 09:20.110
Hey, Butter, this is...

09:20.800 --> 09:22.392
...Hot Pants.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.759
Oh, Hot Pants.

09:27.000 --> 09:32.552
Why don't you come closer
and melt little old Butter.

09:35.680 --> 09:39.195
Hold on.
l got to think about baseball.

09:40.480 --> 09:46.476
Hey, hey, Butter.
This is Double-O-Shoe.

09:47.480 --> 09:50.358
Listen, forget Hot Pants.
You need to talk to my good friend--

09:50.560 --> 09:51.675
-Butcher Boy.
-Psycho Cop.

09:51.880 --> 09:55.236
Not you, you potbellied porkers.

09:56.240 --> 09:57.195
Al.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.076
Hi, Butter.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.030
This is...

10:05.280 --> 10:07.840
...Shoehorn O'Plenty.

10:09.360 --> 10:11.715
-Thanks for the ride home, Griff.
-Don't mention it.

10:11.920 --> 10:13.797
Hey, l'm a Dodge man through
and through...

10:14.000 --> 10:17.913
...but that Geo Metro of yours
is a lot easier to push up that hill.

10:20.280 --> 10:23.716
Yeah, but if you want a car that will
just rust away on the front lawn...

10:23.920 --> 10:25.592
...nothing beats your Dodge.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.628
You got that right.
l'll give you that beer l promised.

10:29.840 --> 10:31.273
There's nobody home.

10:31.480 --> 10:35.189
Beer? l'll come down and join you.

10:35.600 --> 10:39.434
Except my mother-in-law,
the Budweiser Clydesdale.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.798
Al, l got to go anyhow, Al.
l promised Butter l'd call her at 6.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.471
You wouldn't want to leave a phone-sex
operator waiting by the phone.

10:47.120 --> 10:51.272
Wait a minute, Al. Butter is more
than just a $1 .99 a minute.

10:51.520 --> 10:56.389
She's a real good listener
who really understands me.

10:56.600 --> 10:59.433
And, boy, can she talk dirty.

11:00.760 --> 11:04.275
Well, l still better go.
l got a long push home.

11:04.480 --> 11:07.631
All right, take it easy, buddy.

11:15.560 --> 11:20.588
1 -900-YUMMY.

11:47.760 --> 11:52.356
1 -900-YUMMY.

11:58.240 --> 12:03.872
Merry Christmas.
You're cooking with Butter.

12:06.760 --> 12:10.150
Oh, no.

12:32.240 --> 12:33.593
More.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.433
Come on.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.593
You know, this is fantastic.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.115
l can't believe Grandma
bought us these presents...

12:43.320 --> 12:44.548
...and this beautiful dinner.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.991
lt's like she's an older married man
or something.

12:52.760 --> 12:55.957
You know, Peg, who would've thought
that your mom's 1 -900 number...

12:56.160 --> 12:58.355
...would have bought us
our first real Christmas?

12:58.560 --> 13:01.472
You know, for a Bigfoot,
your mom's okay.

13:02.400 --> 13:04.675
Oh, Al, let's invite her down
for Christmas dinner.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.189
What, are you nuts?

13:07.440 --> 13:12.036
Don't you know that the holidays are
the busiest phone-sex time of all.

13:12.720 --> 13:16.076
Daddy, aren't you feeling just
a little guilty that most of the money...

13:16.280 --> 13:19.750
...that paid for this food
came from your NO MA'AM friends?

13:20.840 --> 13:22.592
Guilty, no. Hungry, yes.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.199
What l mean is, is that...

13:26.520 --> 13:29.751
...don't you think you should tell them
that Butter is really Grandma?

13:30.000 --> 13:34.551
Pumpkin, unlike marriage,
phone sex is a victimless crime.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.556
Why spoil the good time
of my dear friends...

13:38.760 --> 13:40.955
...and derail our gravy train
at the same time?

13:42.200 --> 13:46.034
Speaking of which, Peg, would you
pop open another can of gravy, please?

13:49.520 --> 13:51.397
Attagirl.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.514
Dad's right. What they don't know,
won't hurt them.

13:59.760 --> 14:03.196
Besides, when you dial those 900
numbers, all you really care about is--

14:08.480 --> 14:11.790
Getting your money back
for dialling the wrong number.

14:15.080 --> 14:16.035
Who could that be?

14:16.240 --> 14:19.835
Maybe one of the neighbours
found out we had food. Eat fast.

14:22.920 --> 14:26.230
All right, l'll get it.
Just pretend like nothing's happened.

14:28.800 --> 14:30.119
Shut up, now!

14:32.760 --> 14:34.557
Coming.

14:41.480 --> 14:44.392
-Hey, Al.
-Hey, Griff, how you doing?

14:47.440 --> 14:50.716
So you're having another
imaginary Christmas dinner?

14:53.000 --> 14:55.514
Yeah, well, it keeps them happy,
you know.

14:55.760 --> 14:57.159
Thanks for stopping by, buddy.

14:57.360 --> 14:59.635
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
l need your advice.

14:59.880 --> 15:02.474
You know, l've been talking
to Butter a lot lately.

15:02.720 --> 15:07.999
Al, she is more than just phone sex.
She is a beautiful human being.

15:09.240 --> 15:13.916
l never thought l'd say this again:
l think l'm in love.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.879
l think l'm about to blow gravy.

15:24.960 --> 15:28.669
Al, l want to ask her to spend
the holidays with me.

15:37.120 --> 15:38.917
Family meeting.

15:39.160 --> 15:40.593
Al, what are we gonna do?

15:40.840 --> 15:43.229
lf Griff finds out
that Grandma is Butter...

15:43.440 --> 15:45.396
...then he and the guys
will stop calling...

15:45.600 --> 15:48.068
...and we'll have to go back
to living on your income.

15:49.520 --> 15:52.671
l hate him.
He's the Griff who stole Christmas.

15:53.480 --> 15:57.792
-l'll kill this sucker first.
-No! No! No one kills anybody here.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.679
Come here. l got a plan.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.520
l want you two
to get some candy canes...

16:03.720 --> 16:06.029
...and lure Grandma out of her room.

16:06.280 --> 16:08.396
All of her, Dad?

16:09.200 --> 16:11.395
Even the dark, mossy side?

16:12.480 --> 16:14.789
Yes. Will you just go do it?

16:15.240 --> 16:19.313
Peg, l want you to go upstairs
and talk dirty.

16:19.560 --> 16:23.758
Oh, Al.
You mean like this?

16:24.520 --> 16:25.475
Thank you, Peg.

16:25.680 --> 16:29.434
The one meal l've had in months
and l won't be able to keep it down.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.279
You said to talk dirty.

16:32.480 --> 16:36.314
Not to me, you candied yam.
To Griff.

16:36.520 --> 16:37.669
l want you to go upstairs.

16:37.880 --> 16:41.031
When the phone rings, l want you
to answer it. Pretend you're Butter.

16:41.240 --> 16:44.073
Then l want you to tell him
that your love can never be.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.072
Well, what are you gonna do?

16:47.320 --> 16:50.790
l'm gonna soften him up
with our finest liquid refreshment.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.389
The man has gravy.

16:56.440 --> 16:58.874
Not just for breakfast anymore.

17:00.480 --> 17:03.711
Al, what if Butter won't go out
with me? What will l do?

17:03.960 --> 17:05.551
-Not call her anymore?
-Nope.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.836
Call her often,
and call her at peak hours...

17:08.040 --> 17:10.508
...and talk for a long, long time.

17:11.880 --> 17:14.314
But never ask to meet her.

17:14.520 --> 17:16.556
Okay, Al.

17:16.880 --> 17:20.998
This may be just the gravy talking,
but l trust your judgement.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.837
Here goes.

17:38.360 --> 17:40.191
Merry Christmas.

17:40.440 --> 17:43.352
You're cooking with Butter.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.712
Merry Christmas, Butter baby.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.915
This is Shoehorn O'Plenty.

17:53.960 --> 17:57.873
You sound a little different tonight,
Butter. What, you got a little cold?

17:58.080 --> 18:02.551
Well, l did.
But l'm warming up now.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.510
Look, Butter,
l know l've asked you this before...

18:05.720 --> 18:08.188
...but this time l really have to know.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.549
What do you look like?

18:12.480 --> 18:16.758
Al, l am really uncomfortable with this.
l don't think l can go through with it.

18:16.960 --> 18:20.714
Peg, Peg, Peg. Just do what we do
when we have sex.

18:20.920 --> 18:23.673
Pretend we're with someone else.

18:25.960 --> 18:28.235
Thanks, Fabio.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.830
You're welcome, Ginger...

18:33.240 --> 18:35.151
...and Mary Ann.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.994
What do l look like?

18:42.240 --> 18:45.835
Well, l am statuesque
with flowing red hair...

18:46.080 --> 18:50.232
...and a booty that your hand
just aches to grab.

18:52.720 --> 18:56.474
-Butter, you okay?
-Oh, yes. l'm fine.

18:56.720 --> 19:00.679
lt's just that chronic pain
in the butt l live with.

19:00.920 --> 19:04.629
Hey, Butter, l got to ask you this
before l lose the nerve.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.231
Will you come spend
the holidays with me?

19:07.960 --> 19:12.636
Oh, well, l'd love to, Mr. O'Plenty...

19:12.840 --> 19:15.752
...but it's against company policy.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.315
You see, we phone-sex employees...

19:18.560 --> 19:22.599
...live by the highest moral
and ethical standards.

19:23.560 --> 19:27.075
Yeah, well, l'd make it a Christmas
you'd never forget.

19:27.320 --> 19:28.548
Dinner.

19:28.800 --> 19:30.392
Dancing.

19:30.640 --> 19:36.431
A sleigh ride to the airport Motel 6
where l would rock your world.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.234
l'll be there in a half an hour.

19:48.920 --> 19:51.718
Al, l'm leaving you.

19:52.560 --> 19:55.313
Peg, under normal circumstances,
l'd help you pack.

19:55.560 --> 19:58.711
But there's more at stake here
than our marriage, Peg, there's money.

19:58.920 --> 20:00.069
Piles and piles of money.

20:00.280 --> 20:03.033
l want you to get back on that phone
and do what you do best.

20:03.240 --> 20:04.719
Shatter dreams.

20:06.880 --> 20:11.317
Look, Horn, l've got to be
perfectly honest with you.

20:11.560 --> 20:15.758
You see, l'm a happily married
woman with children.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.039
Very, very young children. lnfants.

20:20.240 --> 20:23.915
Hey, I don't mind messing around
with a married woman.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.914
Al, l'll be back by New Year's.

20:30.040 --> 20:32.952
Peg, he's a shoe salesman.

20:33.200 --> 20:35.714
lt would be like leaving me for me.

20:36.720 --> 20:38.199
Oh, yeah.

20:38.440 --> 20:41.000
Thanks for talking me down, Al.

20:42.440 --> 20:43.873
Listen, Mr. O'Plenty.

20:44.080 --> 20:47.436
You know, it's easy to get
carried away on the phone.

20:47.640 --> 20:49.995
l mean, but it's all just a fantasy.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.390
You know my husband
may not be much...

20:52.640 --> 20:54.835
...but he does keep me
in bonbons...

20:55.080 --> 21:00.712
...and l don't have to cook or clean
or even know where my kids are.

21:03.040 --> 21:05.156
Yeah, well....

21:07.120 --> 21:09.588
I guess, I can respect that.

21:09.880 --> 21:12.678
Can we still fool around
on the phone sometimes?

21:12.920 --> 21:14.751
Oh, yeah.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.909
We can do it right now.

21:21.000 --> 21:23.150
Al, you've got to listen to this.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.152
No, l don't.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.155
How'd it go, buddy?

21:28.360 --> 21:31.796
Well, she won't go out with me,
but all is not lost.

21:32.040 --> 21:36.477
She reaffirmed the value
of cheap and meaningless sex.

21:36.880 --> 21:40.509
That's a gift l will always cherish.

21:49.640 --> 21:52.359
Hey, hey, guys, listen,
since the wives are downtown...

21:52.560 --> 21:54.630
...feeding Christmas dinners
to the homeless...

21:54.840 --> 21:58.719
...shouldn't we be down at the nudie bar
feeding dollars to the topless?

22:00.600 --> 22:03.433
-Great idea! To the nudie bar!
-Yes!

22:03.840 --> 22:05.432
Where Christmas is nice

22:05.680 --> 22:07.591
And lap dances are half price

22:07.840 --> 22:09.990
To the nudie bar!

22:10.240 --> 22:14.392
-Where you drink down the shooters
-And unwrap the hooters

22:14.640 --> 22:16.471
At the nudie bar!

22:16.720 --> 22:20.349
-Where eggnog's a-plenty
-And the girls are all 20

22:20.600 --> 22:24.115
At the nudie bar!

22:29.240 --> 22:31.629
l recognize those voices.

22:31.880 --> 22:38.228
Butcher Boy, Psycho Cop,
Hot Pants, Ken Doll, Shoe Horn.

22:39.200 --> 22:42.829
lt's me, Butter.
