WEBVTT

00:02.310 --> 00:05.650
Gypsy, her teeth
are like Swiss cheese.

00:05.650 --> 00:07.160
I've been
sneaking out at night

00:07.160 --> 00:09.080
to go and eat sweet stuff.

00:09.080 --> 00:12.460
- I do a lot worse than that
when I sneak out, right?

00:12.460 --> 00:13.460
Yeah.

00:15.260 --> 00:16.760
I'm Allison Granger

00:16.760 --> 00:18.600
with the Children's Division
of Missouri Social Services.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.770
A report has been filed
by a member of your community

00:20.770 --> 00:22.350
concerning the safety
of your daughter.

00:22.350 --> 00:24.270
Does your mom ever
make you do something

00:24.270 --> 00:25.480
you don't want to do?

00:25.480 --> 00:27.820
My mom is my best friend.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.620
All she wants to do
is keep me safe.

00:29.620 --> 00:31.660
They don't see it.

00:31.660 --> 00:33.460
All that we do for them.

00:33.460 --> 00:35.920
It's our cross to bear.

00:35.920 --> 00:39.050
2009 "Child of the Year" award:

00:39.050 --> 00:42.020
Gypsy Rose Blanchard.

00:42.020 --> 00:45.770
I will bet you
a can of Coke

00:45.770 --> 00:48.450
that you're not allergic
to sugar.

00:50.070 --> 00:52.620
Mom, I was waiting for you!

01:38.170 --> 01:40.010
<i>Dear Gypsy Rose,</i>

01:40.010 --> 01:42.890
<i>your story warms my heart</i>
<i>and gives me hope.</i>

01:42.890 --> 01:44.730
<i>This letter</i>

01:44.730 --> 01:47.150
<i>is just a little something</i>
<i>to help your mama, too.</i>

01:47.150 --> 01:50.570
<i>Sending you this money helps</i>
<i>me keep my mind at ease.</i>

01:50.570 --> 01:53.910
<i>Please do not feel obligated</i>
<i>to respond to this letter.</i>

01:53.910 --> 01:57.250
<i>It truly is my honor</i>
<i>to be able to help.</i>

02:05.520 --> 02:09.070
You are my angel.

02:09.070 --> 02:11.950
And you protect me...

02:11.950 --> 02:14.700
and I protect you.

02:17.080 --> 02:19.380
- Good night.

02:19.380 --> 02:21.470
Good night.

02:37.370 --> 02:40.550
<i>Kissing is a quiet activity.</i>

02:40.550 --> 02:42.720
You don't want to hear
too much smacking there.

02:42.720 --> 02:44.550
The...
that kind of thing--

02:44.550 --> 02:47.560
<i>That's not correct</i>
<i>kissing technique.</i>

04:15.610 --> 04:18.410
And just a little bit
of pink lipstick

04:18.410 --> 04:21.620
to balance out
some dark circles.

04:21.620 --> 04:23.710
Okay.

04:26.050 --> 04:27.680
You look beautiful.
Look!

04:27.680 --> 04:29.180
- Ooh!

04:29.180 --> 04:31.520
Oh, how'd you get
so good at that?

04:31.520 --> 04:34.400
- Um, oh, I just practiced
on a doll.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.360
But you're so pretty.

04:36.360 --> 04:37.450
- Aww.

04:37.450 --> 04:38.820
Now it's your turn.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.580
I'm so excited
to meet new people

04:40.580 --> 04:43.250
at FanOptiCon.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.130
Do you think maybe
we could call Lacey

04:45.130 --> 04:47.930
and see if she can
do my makeup?

04:50.890 --> 04:53.270
- Oh, no.

04:53.270 --> 04:55.440
Honeybee, look at your dress.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.740
You gotta go change.

04:57.740 --> 04:59.740
I'm so sorry,
I must have shrunk it.

04:59.740 --> 05:02.700
- Oh, well-- but, Mom,
you look so great.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.540
And we match together.

05:04.540 --> 05:05.630
- Don't argue.

05:05.630 --> 05:08.130
Go on, go get Cinderella.

05:08.130 --> 05:11.600
You make
the sweetest Cinderella.

05:11.600 --> 05:14.390
And you'll look nice
and beautiful.

05:16.190 --> 05:18.990
- Okay.

05:33.470 --> 05:36.100
One princess
and one princess's mother.

05:36.100 --> 05:38.740
Okay.

05:38.740 --> 05:40.570
- How old are you?
- She's 15.

05:40.570 --> 05:43.450
Born in 1995.

05:43.450 --> 05:47.960
- Oh. The cutoff
for child's admission is 12.

05:47.960 --> 05:49.170
But she looks 12,

05:49.170 --> 05:51.010
so we'll just keep this
our little secret.

05:51.010 --> 05:52.350
- Oh!

05:52.350 --> 05:53.720
Oh, thank you.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.980
- So you can keep that.
- Oh, thank you.

05:55.980 --> 05:58.360
One for you, one for you.

05:58.360 --> 05:59.650
- Thank you.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.660
- You made my day.
- Aww.

06:03.790 --> 06:06.080
- Mom, um...

06:06.080 --> 06:09.380
I thought you said
I was born in 1993.

06:09.380 --> 06:13.010
- Oh, if I said that,
I do apologize.

06:13.010 --> 06:15.640
Since that car accident,

06:15.640 --> 06:18.230
my head is no good
with numbers.

06:18.230 --> 06:20.900
When we had that little trip
to your neurologist,

06:20.900 --> 06:22.280
I looked at your card.

06:22.280 --> 06:24.280
It said 1995.

06:52.420 --> 06:54.640
Gypsy!
Hi, Shelley!

06:54.640 --> 06:56.680
- Ooh!
- Can you believe this?

06:56.680 --> 06:58.600
- You made it!

06:58.600 --> 06:59.770
- Yes.

06:59.770 --> 07:01.650
- Everyone's so nice
to each other here.

07:01.650 --> 07:05.280
- Oh, we're all weirdoes
in our own way.

07:05.280 --> 07:06.740
It's just nice to be around

07:06.740 --> 07:09.370
your own,
specific fellow weirdoes.

07:09.370 --> 07:11.500
Oh, this is Dougie,
my boyfriend.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.840
- Oh, hello.
- But don't tell anybody that.

07:13.840 --> 07:15.800
He is pure Dark Force today.

07:15.800 --> 07:17.390
Can't talk.
- Oh, hi.

07:18.600 --> 07:21.110
- And what are you, Shelley?
- Oh.

07:21.110 --> 07:24.280
I'm a Rebel Commando
on the Endor Strike Force.

07:24.280 --> 07:26.120
Oh, okay.

07:26.120 --> 07:27.620
- Plus, I'm a friendly face,

07:27.620 --> 07:30.000
so kids feel like
they can come up to Dougie

07:30.000 --> 07:31.080
and take a picture.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.500
Aww.

07:32.500 --> 07:33.630
Ooh!

07:33.630 --> 07:35.510
Oh, aren't they gorgeous?

07:35.510 --> 07:38.180
- Oh, if there's anything
your heart desires,

07:38.180 --> 07:40.100
tell me now.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.730
- I like your dress.
- She's so lovely.

07:41.730 --> 07:43.940
Oh, yes.

07:43.940 --> 07:45.700
- Oh my God,
they're so pretty!

07:45.700 --> 07:48.120
Oh, that brings me right back.

07:48.120 --> 07:51.040
You know, your mama used to be
a pageant queen.

07:51.040 --> 07:53.000
Really?
What was your talent?

07:53.000 --> 07:55.170
- Oh, oh, it was nothing.

07:55.170 --> 07:56.680
- Come on, now.

07:56.680 --> 07:58.720
I was a pageant girl, too.
- Oh.

07:58.720 --> 08:01.690
Oh, well, I did
a little bit of yodeling.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.570
- "Yodeling"?
- Yes.

08:03.570 --> 08:06.110
- Well, now we have to see it.
- Yeah, Mom!

08:06.110 --> 08:09.370
I wanna see!
- Oh...

08:19.680 --> 08:21.480
You called?

08:23.020 --> 08:25.530
- Uh, Logan--
but you can call me Russ.

08:25.530 --> 08:27.990
- Oh, well,
Claudinea Blanchard.

08:27.990 --> 08:29.950
But you can call me Dee Dee.

08:29.950 --> 08:31.580
This is my daughter,
Gypsy Rose.

08:31.580 --> 08:32.789
- Hi.

08:32.789 --> 08:34.289
- And this is Dougie,
and this is Shelley.

08:34.289 --> 08:36.210
- How you doing?
- Hey, look at this.

08:36.210 --> 08:37.340
I just had this done.
What do you think?

08:37.340 --> 08:38.340
- Oh!
- Look like me?

08:38.340 --> 08:39.890
Yes.

08:39.890 --> 08:42.309
Yes, very handsome.
- Okay, good.

08:42.309 --> 08:45.190
- Let me see if we can spot
Prince Charming.

08:45.190 --> 08:46.900
- Okay.

08:46.900 --> 08:48.910
Oh, Shelley look!

08:48.910 --> 08:50.740
- So, Dee Dee...

08:50.740 --> 08:53.290
What's a-- what's a real
beauty queen doing here

08:53.290 --> 08:55.960
with all these ones
who are playing dress-up?

08:57.090 --> 08:59.720
- Oh, you a real charmer.

08:59.720 --> 09:01.850
Well, I'm here with Gypsy.

09:01.850 --> 09:03.890
Oh, she loves dressing up

09:03.890 --> 09:06.270
and looking at all the toys.

09:06.270 --> 09:07.650
What do you like?

09:07.650 --> 09:09.620
- What do you mean?

09:09.620 --> 09:11.870
- There's, uh, art...

09:11.870 --> 09:14.080
books, and, uh,
and a contest.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.960
- Oh...
- They got speed dating.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.090
Gypsy likes all of it.

09:18.090 --> 09:22.720
She likes to meet all the nice
and interesting people and...

09:22.720 --> 09:25.480
- What about you?

09:26.520 --> 09:29.570
I don't understand.

09:29.570 --> 09:31.320
Well,
I--I just want to say

09:31.320 --> 09:34.540
I truly appreciate
your devotion to your daughter.

09:34.540 --> 09:36.710
- Oh, she's my everything.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.010
- Yeah, well,
that's just the thing.

09:39.010 --> 09:40.760
And, you know,

09:40.760 --> 09:42.720
maybe this is none
of my beeswax,

09:42.720 --> 09:46.270
but, uh, you just seem
like someone

09:46.270 --> 09:49.280
who's got layers to you.

09:49.280 --> 09:50.950
And, uh...

09:50.950 --> 09:54.750
well, I'm kinda curious
to know more about what--

09:54.750 --> 09:56.790
what those might be.

09:56.790 --> 09:57.920
- Oh...

09:57.920 --> 09:59.210
I mean, it's not--
it's not every day

10:01.300 --> 10:02.930
Oh, it's true.

10:02.930 --> 10:04.350
Well...

10:04.350 --> 10:07.980
Well, would you just excuse me
for one moment, Russ?

10:07.980 --> 10:09.820
- Okay, all right.

10:11.660 --> 10:14.370
Gypsy Rose,
I gotta go to the little girls' room.

10:14.370 --> 10:16.540
Let's go.
- Oh, well, I can stay, Mom.

10:16.540 --> 10:17.630
Shelley's here.

10:17.630 --> 10:19.550
- Well...
- She's fine.

10:19.550 --> 10:21.300
She's fine, Dee Dee.
- Okay.

10:21.300 --> 10:22.720
Be back in a flash.
- Okay.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.010
Whoop, excuse me.

10:24.010 --> 10:26.390
- All right, you wanna go...

10:26.390 --> 10:28.610
Really?

10:28.610 --> 10:30.440
Dougie made a kid cry again.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.650
I gotta go fix it.

10:31.650 --> 10:33.280
Won't be but two minutes, okay?

10:33.280 --> 10:35.910
- Okay, I'll wait here.
- All right, sweetie.

11:30.810 --> 11:32.230
I think
it would look very good on you.

11:32.230 --> 11:34.400
I think so,
but I like angel unicorn.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.620
Oh, yes,
I think that would be great, too.

11:37.620 --> 11:39.080
Maybe that purple's
good, too.

11:39.080 --> 11:41.460
- Totally your color.
- Hi.

11:41.460 --> 11:44.130
I'm Gypsy.
I love Wolverine.

11:46.050 --> 11:48.180
Some call me Logan.

11:48.180 --> 11:50.100
But you can call me Scott.

11:50.100 --> 11:52.480
And everybody loves Cinderella.

11:52.480 --> 11:54.070
- Would you like
to try those on?

11:54.070 --> 11:55.530
- Oh, um, yeah.

11:55.530 --> 11:57.530
Do you have a size four?

11:57.530 --> 11:59.450
- No, but we do have
the same print

11:59.450 --> 12:02.460
on a Mary Jane
in the kid's section.

12:03.750 --> 12:06.300
In fact, have you ever
thought about Ariel?

12:06.300 --> 12:08.470
You'd be great.
You wouldn't have to worry

12:08.470 --> 12:09.720
about moving around
in the tail.

12:09.720 --> 12:11.310
You'd be amazing.

12:11.310 --> 12:14.110
- Oh, I don't have enough
for that.

12:14.110 --> 12:16.280
- Okay, um...

12:16.280 --> 12:17.990
how about a nice red wig?

12:17.990 --> 12:20.160
A girl can do a lot
with a red wig.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.460
- Barbara Gordon--
AKA Batgirl--

12:22.460 --> 12:24.340
Red Sonja, Mystique,

12:24.340 --> 12:26.010
and, of course,

12:26.010 --> 12:28.390
there's only one redhead
for Wolverine:

12:28.390 --> 12:30.350
Jean Grey.

12:30.350 --> 12:33.230
- I don't know them.

12:33.230 --> 12:35.320
- What?

12:35.320 --> 12:37.990
- Would you like to try it on?

12:37.990 --> 12:39.370
- Um...

12:39.370 --> 12:42.580
I don't have enough
for that, either.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.800
- One moment, okay?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.720
- You really don't know
who Jean Grey is?

12:48.720 --> 12:50.140
- I don't know!

12:50.140 --> 12:52.180
- How about...

12:52.180 --> 12:54.020
you start with Flounder?

12:54.020 --> 12:56.070
On the house.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.530
Can I help you?

12:59.530 --> 13:02.200
- That fish is not a flounder.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.420
It looks more like
an angelfish.

13:05.420 --> 13:07.260
- Just because
they call him Flounder

13:07.260 --> 13:10.050
doesn't mean
he <i>is</i> a flounder.

13:11.390 --> 13:13.980
Do you even want
to be Ariel?

13:13.980 --> 13:16.530
- Well, they threatened
to nail her fin to the floor.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.920
- How old are you?

13:26.920 --> 13:29.300
- 18.

13:30.390 --> 13:32.100
Well, it just has
to make it through today.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.930
We're gonna start trying
next month.

13:35.100 --> 13:37.270
Wash your hands
before you slap my ass!

13:37.270 --> 13:38.530
Ready?

13:38.530 --> 13:39.740
I wanna meet someone
while I'm still cute.

13:39.740 --> 13:42.660
Oh, I am so sorry, ma'am.

13:50.590 --> 13:53.060
- Oh...

14:08.210 --> 14:10.930
- So tell me about
your lady love.

14:10.930 --> 14:12.390
- Me?

14:12.390 --> 14:14.720
Oh, no, I don't...

14:14.720 --> 14:16.850
I don't have a girlfriend.

14:16.850 --> 14:20.150
- No, silly, I'm talking
about Wolverine's girlfriend.

14:20.150 --> 14:23.530
- Oh, um...

14:23.530 --> 14:25.290
I was a loner.

14:25.290 --> 14:27.250
I liked it that way.

14:27.250 --> 14:29.800
Doing what needed to be done.

14:31.590 --> 14:32.970
- That's when I met her.

14:32.970 --> 14:35.520
Jean Grey.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.060
I love her,
and I know she loves me.

14:38.060 --> 14:39.820
She's just...

14:39.820 --> 14:43.570
obligated to someone else
who loves her, too.

14:43.570 --> 14:45.870
So...

14:48.670 --> 14:52.010
I walk alone.

14:52.010 --> 14:55.350
Scott?

14:55.350 --> 14:57.690
You're just about
the most honorable man

14:57.690 --> 15:00.020
I've ever met.

15:02.530 --> 15:05.530
- You are the sweetest
Cinderella I've ever met.

15:09.630 --> 15:11.880
Oh, wow!

15:11.880 --> 15:14.180
Look at that!
We have to go look at that!

15:14.180 --> 15:16.470
Come on, let's go!

15:21.520 --> 15:23.400
Have you ever seen
one of these before?

15:23.400 --> 15:24.990
- Yes, of course.
It's the DeLorean.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.120
- Of course I've seen--
- Guys, uh, excuse me?

15:27.120 --> 15:28.410
You wanna come up front?

15:28.410 --> 15:30.460
- Oh, no, that's okay.
- They're okay with it.

15:30.460 --> 15:31.500
Come on.
- Are you sure?

15:31.500 --> 15:32.800
Come up
to the front, yeah.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.760
- Yeah, sweetie, go ahead.
- Thank you.

15:34.760 --> 15:36.680
Thank you so much.

16:51.160 --> 16:52.710
Okay, guys.

16:52.710 --> 16:55.550
If you're ready,
say "great Scott!"

16:55.550 --> 16:57.170
Great Scott!

17:10.450 --> 17:12.750
Dee Dee was about the nicest,

17:12.750 --> 17:15.420
most giving person I ever met.

17:15.420 --> 17:17.970
What kind of monster
would do that to her

17:17.970 --> 17:20.970
and take poor Gypsy
on top of it?

17:25.349 --> 17:27.280
- What'd she always say?

17:27.280 --> 17:28.740
"It's like a pair of shoes:

17:28.740 --> 17:32.160
One never good
without the other."

17:32.160 --> 17:34.960
- They really
only had each other.

17:34.960 --> 17:37.170
- There were never
any men there.

17:38.800 --> 17:41.180
- You know, this one time
Dee Dee called me

17:41.180 --> 17:44.520
the middle of the night
asking about some guy.

17:44.520 --> 17:47.820
She was all worked up.

17:47.820 --> 17:50.450
It was a long time ago,
though, but...

17:50.450 --> 17:52.080
she was pretty freaked.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.660
- I mean, what would
possess Dee Dee to call you

17:53.660 --> 17:55.080
in the middle of the night
about some guy?

17:55.080 --> 17:56.920
- I didn't ask.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.000
It didn't seem right.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.590
I don't know
what was going on.

17:59.590 --> 18:02.760
It was just really important
to Dee Dee to get his name.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.560
- Well, how'd you not have
a million questions?

18:04.560 --> 18:06.520
- Mel, I'm not you.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.070
You're closer to her.

18:08.070 --> 18:09.940
I didn't think much of it
at the time.

18:09.940 --> 18:12.200
- Well, who was he?
- I don't remember.

18:12.200 --> 18:13.410
Some guy.

18:13.410 --> 18:15.080
That was four years ago.

18:15.080 --> 18:17.080
Maybe she had a few.

18:17.080 --> 18:18.550
A drunk dial or something.

18:18.550 --> 18:20.230
You ever see that woman
drink beer?

18:20.230 --> 18:21.670
You know what, Mel?

18:21.670 --> 18:23.430
Maybe at times like these,

18:23.430 --> 18:26.980
every little thing just comes
to your mind, okay?

18:26.980 --> 18:29.860
- Well, who is this guy?
Where is he now?

18:29.860 --> 18:32.280
- Mel, I don't know.

18:40.880 --> 18:42.220
- Okay, sweetie, come on.
Big smile.

18:42.220 --> 18:43.680
Big smile.

18:43.680 --> 18:45.430
All righty.

18:45.430 --> 18:46.730
- Where's-- where's Gypsy?

18:46.730 --> 18:48.190
You said
you'd watch her for me!

18:48.190 --> 18:50.440
Uh, she's just in
the next aisle with Wolverine.

18:50.440 --> 18:51.900
- "Wolverine"?
I knew it.

18:51.900 --> 18:54.990
Don't worry,
Scott's a nice guy.

18:54.990 --> 18:57.120
- Do they hurt?
- Every time.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.130
Oh, oh!

18:59.130 --> 19:00.710
Oh, Gypsy, I found you.

19:00.710 --> 19:02.970
- Oh, um, hi, Mom.

19:02.970 --> 19:04.930
This is my friend, Wolverine.

19:04.930 --> 19:07.730
But you can call him Scott.

19:07.730 --> 19:09.270
Yeah, pleased to meet you.

19:09.270 --> 19:10.900
Um, pardon the claws.

19:14.530 --> 19:16.950
- Well, we have to get going.

19:16.950 --> 19:18.410
- Can we please stay, Mom?

19:18.410 --> 19:20.790
There's a party later on
with a costume contest.

19:20.790 --> 19:22.920
- Oh, we just have
to get going, Gypsybug.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.090
That's just not possible.

19:25.090 --> 19:26.180
- Hey.

19:26.180 --> 19:27.770
Great minds.

19:27.770 --> 19:28.890
Hi, Miss Dee Dee.

19:28.890 --> 19:31.190
Can I-- can I bend your ear?

19:31.190 --> 19:34.450
- Oh, say good-bye
to your friend.

19:37.450 --> 19:38.810
I guess I gotta go.

19:39.580 --> 19:42.170
Unless you want to use those
on my mom for me.

19:42.170 --> 19:44.930
- What?
I--I'm a good guy.

19:44.930 --> 19:46.970
We can still be friends.

19:46.970 --> 19:48.680
Are you on Facebook?

19:48.680 --> 19:52.230
- My mom and I have an account.

19:52.230 --> 19:55.320
- You're 18 and you don't have
your own Facebook account?

19:57.030 --> 19:58.620
- I guess I don't.

19:58.620 --> 20:00.120
What's yours?

20:00.120 --> 20:01.420
Ms. Dee Dee,
I didn't--

20:01.420 --> 20:02.630
I didn't mean
to scare you off earlier.

20:02.630 --> 20:03.960
- Oh, no.
- Yeah.

20:03.960 --> 20:06.380
I know I can be
a little forward, I apologize.

20:06.380 --> 20:07.680
Oh, not at all.

20:07.680 --> 20:10.770
- Just, um, you know, I--
I been where you been.

20:10.770 --> 20:12.400
I...

20:12.400 --> 20:14.280
I lost my...

20:14.280 --> 20:17.740
my boy when he was 13.

20:17.740 --> 20:20.160
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.000
That's my worst nightmare.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.380
- Yeah.

20:23.380 --> 20:24.460
It was Batten disease.

20:24.460 --> 20:26.590
He-- he was in a chair
at the end.

20:26.590 --> 20:29.430
Oh, my Lord.

20:29.430 --> 20:31.140
- So I understand how your--

20:31.140 --> 20:33.360
your kid can be
your everything.

20:33.360 --> 20:35.360
- Mm-hmm, she is my everything.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.610
- Oh, I-- I see that.
That's the truth.

20:37.610 --> 20:39.200
I see the way
you take care of her.

20:39.200 --> 20:40.290
Yeah.

20:40.290 --> 20:42.080
- You're the only
true superhero here.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.290
- Oh, you are
embarrassing me. Ha.

20:44.290 --> 20:46.130
Just, uh, from one
to another,

20:46.130 --> 20:48.890
a little piece of advice:

20:48.890 --> 20:50.640
You gotta cut out
a little piece

20:50.640 --> 20:52.060
of the world for yourself.

20:52.060 --> 20:54.860
That-- that's what I meant
when I was asking about you.

20:54.860 --> 20:57.240
You can lose yourself
in all the giving.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.990
Well, that is
a beautiful thought.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.460
But having been where I am,

21:03.460 --> 21:05.960
you know how hard that is.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.630
Well, I understand how
you can think that way, sure.

21:08.630 --> 21:10.970
Um, sure do.

21:10.970 --> 21:14.650
Um, it's just that,
you know...

21:14.650 --> 21:16.270
I just want to get to know you.

21:20.870 --> 21:22.830
If you stay for a while,
buy you a pizza.

21:22.830 --> 21:24.790
- Oh...
- Got my cutters.

21:24.790 --> 21:27.920
- Oh, oh, I have to get back
to my daughter, but--

21:27.920 --> 21:29.510
she needs her medication.

21:29.510 --> 21:30.970
- Oh, I understand that.

21:30.970 --> 21:33.270
Sure I do.

21:36.610 --> 21:39.030
- Did you see him
following me around?

21:39.030 --> 21:42.030
That used to happen
when I was a girl.

21:42.030 --> 21:43.910
Oh, I'm not used to that.

21:43.910 --> 21:46.080
I was just trying to spend
the day with my daughter,

21:46.080 --> 21:47.670
and he comes up.

21:47.670 --> 21:49.170
Did you think he was cute?

21:49.170 --> 21:51.180
He was polite.

21:51.180 --> 21:53.560
Some people just don't know
how to mind their own beeswax,

21:53.560 --> 21:55.230
that's for sure.

21:55.230 --> 21:57.190
I suppose he was just trying
to be nice,

21:57.190 --> 21:58.780
but you never can tell.

21:59.870 --> 22:02.040
- Mom?

22:02.040 --> 22:04.870
How did you meet my dad?

22:04.870 --> 22:07.080
- Oh, we were just

22:07.080 --> 22:10.970
two young, dumb kids
on the bayou.

22:12.850 --> 22:16.190
Dumb enough to fall in love.

22:16.190 --> 22:18.610
- Well,
what's dumb about love?

22:18.610 --> 22:21.070
Love is not dumb.

22:21.070 --> 22:23.530
It makes you dumb,
that kind of love.

22:23.530 --> 22:26.960
Not the way that I love you.

22:26.960 --> 22:30.630
- I know that you love me,
but you must have loved my dad.

22:30.630 --> 22:32.680
Like crazy.

22:32.680 --> 22:34.640
I might still do.

22:34.640 --> 22:37.940
That's probably why
I never had anyone else.

22:37.940 --> 22:40.860
Then why did you split up?

22:40.860 --> 22:43.530
- Oh, it wasn't my decision.

22:45.870 --> 22:48.000
- Oh.

22:48.000 --> 22:50.630
Then why...

22:50.630 --> 22:52.510
I don't understand.

22:52.510 --> 22:54.180
- What you need to understand

22:54.180 --> 22:57.100
is that you can't rely
on any man.

22:57.100 --> 22:59.360
Or anyone, for that matter,

22:59.360 --> 23:02.070
other than your own mama.

23:03.320 --> 23:06.620
- Um, so he just left?

23:08.710 --> 23:11.300
- Well...

23:11.300 --> 23:13.930
come to think of it,
it was my decision.

23:13.930 --> 23:17.350
There were two choices,
but there was only one choice.

23:20.230 --> 23:22.280
And I chose you.

23:22.280 --> 23:25.990
And I will always choose you.

23:25.990 --> 23:28.000
A man can leave.

23:28.000 --> 23:31.420
A mother, not so much.

23:33.470 --> 23:35.220
Well, we have enough love

23:35.220 --> 23:37.970
between the two of us,
don't we?

23:39.600 --> 23:42.440
- I love you, Mama.

23:42.440 --> 23:45.990
- Oh, I love you, Gypsybug.

24:53.080 --> 24:56.420
<i>She's 15.</i>
<i>Born in 1995.</i>

26:34.660 --> 26:36.750
- Oh, Gypsy, girl!

26:36.750 --> 26:38.710
Grab your mama
a little sweet tea.

26:38.710 --> 26:40.510
I'll even let you have
a little sip

26:40.510 --> 26:41.880
if you're a good girl.

26:41.880 --> 26:44.810
- You got a deal, lady!
- Okay.

26:59.460 --> 27:01.300
- Hello.
- Hi.

27:01.300 --> 27:02.970
- That's Pump #7?

27:02.970 --> 27:04.640
- And this too, please.

27:04.640 --> 27:07.180
That'll be $35.25.

27:10.520 --> 27:12.900
I got your quarter.
- Thank you.

27:15.790 --> 27:18.160
And one of those, too.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.780
Thank you.

27:35.570 --> 27:38.160
- Hello?

27:38.160 --> 27:41.210
Who is this?

27:41.210 --> 27:42.210
Russ.

27:42.210 --> 27:44.510
Oh, Wolverine.

27:44.510 --> 27:47.510
Well, of course.
How could I forget?

27:47.510 --> 27:49.180
How'd you get my number?

28:01.460 --> 28:05.590
<i>Hey, it's Gypsy</i>
<i>from the convention.</i>

28:07.640 --> 28:09.640
<i>Hi,</i>
<i>Gypsy-from-the-convention.</i>

28:09.640 --> 28:13.070
<i>So weird, I was</i>
<i>just thinking about you.</i>

28:14.400 --> 28:17.030
<i>What a crazy coincidence.</i>

28:17.030 --> 28:19.040
<i>It must be fate.</i>

28:19.040 --> 28:20.960
<i>Let's be friends, okay?</i>

28:22.460 --> 28:24.300
<i>So, 18 years old</i>

28:24.300 --> 28:26.180
<i>and you just got</i>
<i>your own Facebook.</i>

28:26.180 --> 28:27.720
<i>Better late than never,</i>
<i>I guess.</i>

28:27.720 --> 28:29.640
<i>How's life?</i>

28:29.640 --> 28:31.730
<i>I wanna know more about you.</i>

28:33.480 --> 28:35.030
<i>I've been keeping busy.</i>

28:35.030 --> 28:36.910
<i>Hanging out with my friends.</i>

28:36.910 --> 28:38.450
<i>Sometimes I feel like</i>
<i>it's my job</i>

28:38.450 --> 28:40.370
<i>just to make people happy.</i>

28:40.370 --> 28:43.000
<i>I'm sure you don't have</i>
<i>to work hard at that.</i>

28:43.000 --> 28:45.130
<i>After all,</i>
<i>you charmed me, right?</i>

28:57.820 --> 28:59.580
- Oh, hi.

29:01.250 --> 29:04.170
<i>My work as a surgeon</i>
<i>is really demanding,</i>

29:04.170 --> 29:07.590
<i>but it's all worth it to see</i>
<i>the look on someone's face</i>

29:07.590 --> 29:09.510
<i>after they get</i>
<i>that second chance at life.</i>

29:09.510 --> 29:13.190
<i>That's so neat.</i>
<i>I'm so glad I met you.</i>

29:13.190 --> 29:15.400
<i>You're a really cool girl,</i>
<i>you know that?</i>

29:15.400 --> 29:18.490
<i> Scott, do you ever want</i>
<i>to get married one day?</i>

29:18.490 --> 29:20.030
<i>Sure, I do.</i>

29:20.030 --> 29:22.580
<i>I just haven't met</i>
<i>the right girl yet.</i>

29:22.580 --> 29:27.340
<i>L.O.L., any girl</i>
<i>would be lucky to have you.</i>

29:27.340 --> 29:29.470
<i>I want to have</i>
<i>a winter wedding.</i>

29:29.470 --> 29:31.180
<i>I think it would be</i>
so <i>romantic</i>

29:31.180 --> 29:33.430
<i>to get married in the snow.</i>

29:33.430 --> 29:36.690
<i>Sounds like you're</i>
<i>a "White Wedding" kind of girl.</i>

29:36.690 --> 29:38.320
<i>You're so funny.</i>

29:39.820 --> 29:41.450
<i>I just realized:</i>

29:41.450 --> 29:44.620
<i>It's been a month</i>
<i>since we met!</i>

29:44.620 --> 29:47.460
<i>It's our anniversary.</i>

29:47.460 --> 29:50.380
<i>Happy anniversary,</i>
<i>cool girl.</i>

29:50.380 --> 29:52.220
<i>I'll give you my address</i>

29:52.220 --> 29:55.560
<i>if you ever want</i>
<i>to send me a present.</i>

29:55.560 --> 29:58.030
<i>The castle takes deliveries?</i>

29:58.030 --> 30:00.030
<i>L.O.L.</i>

30:00.030 --> 30:04.410
<i>Or in case you want</i>
<i>to come take me away.</i>

30:04.410 --> 30:06.750
<i>Are you Princess Fiona?</i>

30:06.750 --> 30:09.970
- <i>I am.</i>
<i>Awaiting a knight so bold</i>

30:09.970 --> 30:11.760
<i>as to rescue me.</i>

30:11.760 --> 30:13.850
<i>Aw, that's nice.</i>
<i>Now, let's go!</i>

30:13.850 --> 30:17.690
<i>Wait, Sir Knight,</i>
<i>this be-eth our first meeting.</i>

30:17.690 --> 30:21.780
<i>Should it not be a wonderful,</i>
<i>romantic moment?</i>

30:21.780 --> 30:25.450
<i>Yeah, sorry, lady.</i>

30:25.450 --> 30:26.960
- Hi!

30:26.960 --> 30:28.590
Hi!

30:28.590 --> 30:32.090
Shh, my mom is sleeping
and she works really hard.

30:32.090 --> 30:33.260
- Oh, okay.

30:33.260 --> 30:35.980
Uh, are you Gypsy?
- Mm-hmm.

30:35.980 --> 30:38.440
- Well, then this is for you.

30:38.440 --> 30:40.530
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

31:24.200 --> 31:26.620
Like Jean Grey.

31:26.620 --> 31:28.870
<i>You know, Dee Dee,</i>
<i>I was thinking:</i>

31:28.870 --> 31:31.750
We been talking a lot,
you know, and, um...

31:31.750 --> 31:34.180
I was wondering if...

31:34.180 --> 31:36.760
you'd be open to a visit?

31:36.760 --> 31:39.440
- What do you mean?

31:39.440 --> 31:41.360
- Well, I'd like to, uh--

31:41.360 --> 31:43.030
I'd like to do some man work.

31:43.030 --> 31:44.280
- Oh.

31:44.280 --> 31:46.120
- It's best when you do it
for a good woman

31:46.120 --> 31:47.870
who appreciates it and--

31:47.870 --> 31:50.040
and it makes you feel
like a superhero.

31:50.040 --> 31:53.130
I just haven't had a chance
to do any

31:53.130 --> 31:55.890
since the divorce.

31:55.890 --> 31:57.810
- Oh, I'm sorry.

31:57.810 --> 32:01.020
<i>You haven't told me much</i>
<i>about her.</i>

32:01.020 --> 32:03.400
<i>We just, uh,</i>
<i>married really young</i>

32:03.400 --> 32:06.070
and she wasn't really built
for the long haul.

32:06.070 --> 32:08.080
And she just-- she wanted more
out of life

32:08.080 --> 32:09.790
than-- than me, you know?

32:09.790 --> 32:13.300
And then when my son--
well, you know...

32:14.630 --> 32:17.260
<i>I'm a simple guy.</i>

32:17.260 --> 32:20.350
And simple things
make me happy.

32:22.060 --> 32:24.440
And I just thought
to myself...

32:24.440 --> 32:27.950
"Well, Dee Dee
doesn't have a man.

32:27.950 --> 32:31.080
Maybe she could use one."

32:31.080 --> 32:34.500
I could change the oil,
just do some yard work.

32:34.500 --> 32:37.890
You know, some handyman stuff
around the house.

32:37.890 --> 32:40.520
Just, um, you know,
take out the garbage.

32:40.520 --> 32:44.270
- I wouldn't put you out.
We get along just fine.

32:44.270 --> 32:46.400
- You don't
mind me saying, I--

32:46.400 --> 32:49.240
I think you could use
some enjoyment for yourself.

32:49.240 --> 32:50.540
You know?

32:50.540 --> 32:52.920
I mean, geez,
you do everything for everyone.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.000
Uh, so says everyone.

32:55.000 --> 32:56.920
You know, I could-- I could
help you with your daughter.

32:56.920 --> 32:59.010
- No.

33:01.060 --> 33:03.480
Thank you, Russ.

33:04.820 --> 33:06.400
Good-bye.

33:42.390 --> 33:43.940
What are you...

33:43.940 --> 33:45.730
- Giggling about?

33:45.730 --> 33:48.030
- Hi, Lacey.
- Hi.

33:51.030 --> 33:53.870
Man, I need something
to laugh at.

33:55.170 --> 33:57.170
I called my mom
a "B-I-T-C-H"

33:57.170 --> 33:59.510
'cause she says I have to go
to community college now

33:59.510 --> 34:02.100
instead of real college.

34:02.100 --> 34:04.730
I didn't get enough
of a scholarship.

34:04.730 --> 34:07.150
So that's why I called her
a bitch, and--

34:07.150 --> 34:09.320
and now she's making me
wash the windows

34:09.320 --> 34:11.489
to learn something
about something.

34:11.489 --> 34:13.830
I don't know.

34:13.830 --> 34:16.880
Anyway, what's so funny?

34:17.880 --> 34:20.550
Um...

34:23.350 --> 34:25.520
Okay, I'm gonna tell you,
but really need

34:25.520 --> 34:27.060
to keep your voice down, okay?

34:27.060 --> 34:29.690
'Cause it's a secret.

34:31.239 --> 34:33.699
- Okay. Shoot.

34:34.949 --> 34:38.090
- I met my Prince Charming.

34:39.090 --> 34:40.719
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

34:40.719 --> 34:42.300
- How?

34:42.300 --> 34:46.020
- I guess you could say
he swept me off my feet.

34:48.190 --> 34:49.780
- Well...

34:49.780 --> 34:51.739
I guess that's
what princes do, huh?

34:51.739 --> 34:53.159
- Mm-hmm.
- They just

34:53.159 --> 34:55.080
sweep you off your feet.

34:57.370 --> 34:59.920
How'd you meet
this mystery man?

34:59.920 --> 35:01.760
- Well...

35:01.760 --> 35:04.050
uh, it was pretty magical,
actually.

35:04.050 --> 35:07.060
I saw him and I just--I knew.

35:07.060 --> 35:09.270
He's--he's manly,
and he's heroic,

35:09.270 --> 35:11.400
but he's also really,
really nice.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.160
And we're gonna have two kids--

35:13.160 --> 35:14.830
once we're married,
of course.

35:14.830 --> 35:18.960
But he's gonna take me
far away from here

35:18.960 --> 35:21.250
to someplace
really special, you know?

35:21.250 --> 35:22.630
Like--like Arkansas, maybe.

35:22.630 --> 35:25.430
Oh, my gosh, and we're gonna
have a winter wedding

35:25.430 --> 35:28.270
so that we can be in the snow
and I'll be like a snow gypsy.

35:28.270 --> 35:30.570
- Wow, that sounds amazing.
- Lacey, you have to come.

35:30.570 --> 35:31.980
You have to come
to the wedding.

35:31.980 --> 35:34.450
Will you--will you be
my maid of honor?

35:34.450 --> 35:35.780
You can wear red.

35:35.780 --> 35:37.830
'Cause there's gonna be
red roses everywhere,

35:37.830 --> 35:39.370
so you can match them.

35:42.880 --> 35:44.760
- I wish my Grandma Emma
was still alive

35:44.760 --> 35:47.770
so that she could come, too.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.390
Oh, by the way,

35:49.390 --> 35:51.690
that's my private
Facebook name, okay?

35:51.690 --> 35:53.360
Emma Rose.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.070
Okay.
- So happy.

35:55.070 --> 35:57.120
Okay, yeah.

35:57.120 --> 35:58.250
You know what?

35:58.250 --> 35:59.870
If he has a brother,

35:59.870 --> 36:02.710
you tell him
to come sweep me away.

36:02.710 --> 36:05.720
He can find me
at the community college.

36:05.720 --> 36:08.270
Okay, I'll tell him.

36:08.270 --> 36:10.390
You...

36:10.390 --> 36:11.610
it's a secret, right?

36:11.610 --> 36:13.230
So you can't tell anyone.
You promise?

36:13.230 --> 36:14.490
- No, no, I promise.

36:14.490 --> 36:16.910
I won't tell a soul.

36:16.910 --> 36:19.790
- We have a secret.

38:19.530 --> 38:20.990
Scott.

38:20.990 --> 38:22.620
Oh, no, what happened?

38:22.620 --> 38:24.370
Are you okay?

38:24.370 --> 38:26.500
Oh...

38:27.790 --> 38:30.420
It's me, Gypsy.

38:32.050 --> 38:34.720
- Gypsy?

38:34.720 --> 38:36.480
- Yeah.

38:36.480 --> 38:39.020
Yeah, it's me.

38:39.020 --> 38:40.400
- But you're walking.

38:40.400 --> 38:45.160
Shh, I can actually walk,
okay? Don't tell anyone.

38:46.410 --> 38:49.340
- I just--I didn't know
you were coming.

38:49.340 --> 38:51.590
- Of course I came.

38:51.590 --> 38:54.350
I knew that you needed me.

38:55.980 --> 38:59.770
- You look
completely different.

38:59.770 --> 39:01.780
You look...

39:03.620 --> 39:06.040
- I'm just--
I'm a little surprised is all.

39:06.040 --> 39:08.210
My poor baby.
Gosh.

39:08.830 --> 39:10.840
Have they given you anything
for your pain?

39:10.840 --> 39:13.340
Anything?

39:13.340 --> 39:14.720
Just a local.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.730
They reset my nose.

39:16.730 --> 39:19.020
- You need Vicodin
or--or maybe a Xanax.

39:19.020 --> 39:21.360
Or what about a Percocet
or an Ativan?

39:21.360 --> 39:22.400
I can ask for you.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.280
- They--they said they wouldn't

39:24.280 --> 39:27.450
because I've been drinking.

39:27.450 --> 39:30.880
- Oh, silly, you don't need
to tell them the whole truth

39:30.880 --> 39:33.590
when you're in pain.

39:33.590 --> 39:35.350
Um...

39:35.350 --> 39:38.180
well, it's too late now.

39:38.180 --> 39:40.360
Yeah.

39:41.730 --> 39:43.360
- I can't get over this.

39:43.360 --> 39:44.990
I don't understand.

39:44.990 --> 39:47.910
- You poor thing.
No one should suffer.

39:47.910 --> 39:50.250
No one.

39:50.250 --> 39:52.340
But don't you worry
about anything now, okay?

39:52.340 --> 39:54.130
I'm gonna take care of you.

39:54.130 --> 39:57.220
I'm gonna take
real good care of you.

39:58.220 --> 40:01.020
- You look good with red hair.

40:01.020 --> 40:02.940
- You like it?

40:13.380 --> 40:16.260
Gypsy?

40:16.260 --> 40:19.730
Gypsy?

40:20.730 --> 40:23.150
Gypsy?

40:23.150 --> 40:25.280
Oh...

40:30.710 --> 40:32.500
<i>Dear Mother,</i>
<i>I'm in love</i>

40:32.500 --> 40:35.050
<i>and running away to get married</i>
<i>and have kids,</i>

40:35.050 --> 40:37.180
<i>and there's nothing</i>
<i>you can do to stop me.</i>

40:37.180 --> 40:40.640
<i>Love, Gypsy,</i>
<i>your</i> 19 <i>-year-old daughter.</i>

40:51.870 --> 40:55.210
Oh, hello?
Shelley?

40:55.210 --> 41:00.010
Shelley, you remember that man
we met at the convention?

41:00.010 --> 41:02.230
He was dressed as Wolverine?

41:02.230 --> 41:06.320
No, not that Wolverine,
the other Wolverine.

41:06.320 --> 41:08.950
Do you know his name?

41:08.950 --> 41:11.410
Think Shelley, I need it.

41:23.520 --> 41:26.230
- What a beautiful place
you have.

41:27.490 --> 41:29.280
- Really?

41:35.170 --> 41:38.510
- I was just saying
it made me feel...

41:38.510 --> 41:40.800
um, grown up.

41:45.480 --> 41:47.190
- You're so tiny.

41:47.190 --> 41:49.360
Not much taller than

41:49.360 --> 41:51.540
when you're in the chair.

41:53.710 --> 41:56.550
I'm never sitting
in that again.

41:56.550 --> 41:59.590
Now that my Prince Charming

41:59.590 --> 42:00.970
has saved me.

42:06.110 --> 42:07.860
- What the fuck, man?

42:07.860 --> 42:10.410
- It's just me, man.

42:17.960 --> 42:19.300
- Dance with me.

42:19.300 --> 42:21.430
- Hey, no--

42:21.430 --> 42:23.060
We just woke him up and--

42:23.060 --> 42:24.520
- Oh, we don't need music.

42:24.520 --> 42:26.770
Come on.

42:26.770 --> 42:29.650
I had a rough night.

42:29.650 --> 42:32.070
I kinda just want
to sit here.

42:32.070 --> 42:33.580
Oh, of course.

42:33.580 --> 42:35.790
Um, let me help you.

42:35.790 --> 42:37.210
Is the kitchen this way?

42:37.210 --> 42:38.920
- Yeah, but I--I'm all right.

42:38.920 --> 42:40.380
That's...

42:40.380 --> 42:42.640
- I can't wait to hear
all about it.

42:44.390 --> 42:46.650
Um...

42:55.410 --> 42:58.040
Here, put this on your nose.

42:58.040 --> 42:59.880
Thanks.

42:59.880 --> 43:02.890
- Anything you need.

43:02.890 --> 43:06.270
So tell me what happened.

43:08.560 --> 43:10.980
It was just this drunk guy
at the bar.

43:10.980 --> 43:12.610
He wouldn't leave
the bartender alone.

43:12.610 --> 43:14.120
She's a friend of mine.

43:14.120 --> 43:17.410
So I tried to talk to him,
get him to lay off...

43:18.830 --> 43:20.750
But, like, nicely,
'cause I don't...

43:20.750 --> 43:21.760
- Mm-hmm.

43:21.760 --> 43:23.300
- I don't believe in violence.

43:23.300 --> 43:26.390
But apparently he has
no problem with it,

43:26.390 --> 43:27.640
'cause he got in
a couple good ones

43:27.640 --> 43:30.110
before the bouncer
could get to me.

43:30.110 --> 43:32.360
- Oh, my poor baby.

43:32.360 --> 43:34.530
Yeah.

43:34.530 --> 43:38.000
You are so brave.

43:42.380 --> 43:44.890
Just what was right.

43:47.640 --> 43:50.480
- My hero.

43:52.780 --> 43:55.200
Wouldn't it be romantic if--

43:55.200 --> 43:57.330
if after all this time

43:57.330 --> 44:01.210
Wolverine and Jean Grey
could be together?

44:02.670 --> 44:06.350
And she could finally be free
from that evil Cyclops?

44:09.020 --> 44:11.940
- You know she kills him
in "Last Stand"?

45:11.520 --> 45:14.270
Is Gypsy here?

45:14.270 --> 45:15.900
Mom?

45:15.900 --> 45:17.360
- Oh, Honey Bee.

45:17.360 --> 45:19.410
Oh, I found your note.

45:21.040 --> 45:22.410
- Okay.

45:22.410 --> 45:25.040
- Listen to me, baby--
- Um, no.

45:25.040 --> 45:27.930
I'm not a baby.
- No, I know.

45:27.930 --> 45:29.510
I know.

45:29.510 --> 45:33.100
I just always will see you
as my little girl.

45:33.100 --> 45:34.980
But you're all grown up.

45:34.980 --> 45:38.820
Oh, I can see that.

45:38.820 --> 45:40.780
- I am, I am.

45:40.780 --> 45:43.620
I know
you're punishing me,

45:43.620 --> 45:45.540
and maybe I deserve it.

45:45.540 --> 45:48.970
And I'm so sorry, baby.

45:48.970 --> 45:52.310
I would do anything for you.

45:52.310 --> 45:54.600
I would love you more

45:54.600 --> 45:57.150
than anything
in the whole world.

45:57.150 --> 45:58.820
I would give up anything
for you.

45:58.820 --> 46:01.780
I have given up
everything for you.

46:01.780 --> 46:03.410
I know.

46:03.410 --> 46:06.710
Well, then come on.

46:06.710 --> 46:08.880
Come on, let's go home.

46:08.880 --> 46:11.180
- Listen, Mom...

46:11.180 --> 46:13.890
I wanna stay with Scott.

46:13.890 --> 46:16.940
Oh, I know you do, I know.

46:16.940 --> 46:19.190
Oh, believe me, I know.

46:19.190 --> 46:21.490
That's why-- come on, hon.

46:21.490 --> 46:23.450
That's why I need you
to go home with me.

46:23.450 --> 46:26.920
I--I'm not gonna make you
stop seeing your friend.

46:26.920 --> 46:29.130
I promise you.

46:29.130 --> 46:31.510
But this is not how you do it.

46:31.510 --> 46:32.970
Sneaking off.

46:32.970 --> 46:35.520
I had a anxiety attack.

46:35.520 --> 46:38.400
I was terrified.

46:38.400 --> 46:39.940
Let's just...

46:39.940 --> 46:42.910
Let's just do this
the right way.

46:42.910 --> 46:44.410
He can come over to the house.

46:44.410 --> 46:47.330
We can both get to know him.

46:47.330 --> 46:48.590
Come on.

46:48.590 --> 46:50.670
Let's just go, Gypsy Rose.

46:50.670 --> 46:53.850
Uh, just slow it down
and enjoy it.

46:53.850 --> 46:56.350
Okay?

47:00.780 --> 47:03.530
Come on, please.

47:03.530 --> 47:05.950
Gypsy Rose...

47:05.950 --> 47:08.080
Do you want me...

47:08.080 --> 47:09.920
to cause a scene here?

47:09.920 --> 47:11.170
Do you?

47:11.170 --> 47:13.600
- No.

47:21.360 --> 47:24.280
Will you excuse me?

47:26.080 --> 47:28.790
I'll talk to you soon.

47:32.550 --> 47:34.090
I don't know what she told you,

47:34.090 --> 47:36.560
but she's 14 years old.
