WEBVTT

00:19.420 --> 00:21.718
(woman sobbing quietly)

00:40.700 --> 00:43.168
(gunshot, woman screams)

01:03.390 --> 01:05.153
Good morning.

01:06.360 --> 01:09.295
And to you, as well.

01:15.570 --> 01:18.164
Okay. This has to stop.

01:18.210 --> 01:20.337
This only speaking
when spoken to thing?

01:20.380 --> 01:23.099
You're obviously angry that
I went to your friend Alistair

01:23.150 --> 01:25.277
and that he told me you knew
someone named Irene.

01:25.310 --> 01:26.811
You think I
overstepped my bounds.

01:26.850 --> 01:28.374
Hadn't thought about it
that much at all, actually.

01:28.420 --> 01:30.115
We both know that's not true.

01:30.150 --> 01:32.516
And guess what--
I'm your sober companion.

01:32.560 --> 01:34.448
It's my job to overstep
polite boundaries.

01:34.490 --> 01:36.856
Part of recovery is about
addressing painful things.

01:36.890 --> 01:38.778
If you ignore them,
they become triggers.

01:38.830 --> 01:40.525
Could you shoot all this
to me in an e-mail?

01:40.560 --> 01:41.891
I'm just much better at
processing the written word.

01:44.430 --> 01:47.194
I'm gonna stay after you
about this, because I know
how important it is.

01:47.240 --> 01:49.504
But if you won't talk to me,
there's only so much I can do.

01:49.540 --> 01:51.838
(cell phone chimes)

01:55.840 --> 01:58.400
What is it?
You're right.

01:58.450 --> 02:00.873
I have been
cutting you off.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.241
It amounts to sulking,

02:03.290 --> 02:05.918
and it is no way to conduct
an adult relationship.

02:05.950 --> 02:07.781
I might not like what you did,

02:07.820 --> 02:09.526
but I suppose I have to...

02:09.560 --> 02:11.551
respect your right to do it.

02:12.830 --> 02:15.458
Good.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.321
I would propose a toast to our
new spirit of collaboration,

02:18.370 --> 02:21.589
but I, um... I've neglected
to pour myself a coffee.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.699
Would you mind
waiting a moment?

02:23.740 --> 02:25.332
Of course.

02:34.650 --> 02:37.448
(door opens and closes)

02:39.360 --> 02:40.918
Sherlock?

02:42.630 --> 02:45.326
(siren whoops)

02:45.360 --> 02:46.588
No Watson?

02:46.630 --> 02:48.188
She took the morning off.

02:48.230 --> 02:50.528
Something about
a cousin falling ill.

02:51.900 --> 02:53.731
Shall we?
Yeah.

02:53.770 --> 02:55.465
Jay and Amy Myrose.

02:55.500 --> 02:57.707
Their cleaning lady
got here this morning,

02:57.740 --> 02:59.207
found them like this.

02:59.240 --> 03:00.969
Preliminary times of death
indicate the suspect

03:01.010 --> 03:03.274
broke in after midnight,

03:03.310 --> 03:05.449
dragged the Myroses
out of their beds,

03:05.480 --> 03:08.779
forced them to give up the
combination to their wall safe,

03:08.820 --> 03:11.687
and then...

03:11.720 --> 03:13.381
I, uh... I got to tell you,

03:13.420 --> 03:15.285
coming in here
this morning

03:15.320 --> 03:17.959
was like waking up in the
middle of a nightmare

03:17.990 --> 03:20.823
that I thought I stopped
having a long time ago.

03:20.860 --> 03:22.964
Is that because o_f_the
uncanny Similarities

03:23.000 --> 03:26.367
to the Wade Crewes
murders in 1999?

03:26.400 --> 03:28.265
You-you know about that?

03:28.300 --> 03:30.268
I picked up the particulars
of these deaths

03:30.310 --> 03:32.335
on my scanner app while
I was taxiing over here.

03:32.380 --> 03:34.940
Victims' arms bound
with pile hitch knots,

03:34.980 --> 03:37.403
pillows strapped
to their heads using belts

03:37.450 --> 03:38.803
shortly before
they were killed.

03:38.850 --> 03:42.513
Have to admit, the
similarities are striking.

03:42.550 --> 03:44.245
Yes, no, no, I know.

03:44.290 --> 03:46.918
I just didn't think you'd
know about Wade Crewes.

03:46.960 --> 03:49.656
13 years ago, he perpetrated
three separate home invasions

03:49.690 --> 03:50.850
over the course
of three months.

03:50.890 --> 03:52.448
In every instance,
a wealthy couple

03:53.930 --> 03:55.625
Contents of their
wall safe emptied.

03:55.660 --> 03:58.925
Eventually, he was brought
to justice by, uh... you.

03:58.970 --> 04:00.392
Yeah.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.761
Something of a
career-defining case.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.404
Mmm. Of course I'm
familiar with it.

04:05.440 --> 04:06.771
There.

04:06.810 --> 04:08.368
Always nice when
a psychopath

04:08.410 --> 04:10.947
grooms himself to look the part,
don't you think?

04:10.980 --> 04:14.609
Question is,
why copycat a home invader?

04:14.650 --> 04:17.687
You think this is
the work of a copycat?

04:17.720 --> 04:20.416
Well, it's either that, or...

04:20.460 --> 04:22.678
some kind of
weird cornCIdence.

04:22.730 --> 04:24.527
There is_ another
pOSSIbIIIty.

04:24.560 --> 04:27.051
But that depends on what
we find in the shoe closet.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.421
HOLMES:
I noticed something odd
in the old case files.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.768
Two of the safes
that Crewes looted

04:31.800 --> 04:33.290
were located in bedroom closets.

04:33.340 --> 04:34.659
The other was in an office,

04:34.700 --> 04:36.065
but he rifled through
the bedroom aanay.

04:36.100 --> 04:39.035
Now, in each case,
the woman of the house

04:39.070 --> 04:40.708
had a collection
of expenswe shoes.

04:40.740 --> 04:43.379
And in every case,
one of those shoes

04:43.410 --> 04:44.707
was missing
after the murder.

04:44.750 --> 04:45.978
See for yourself.

04:47.350 --> 04:48.840
Why would someone
steal one shoe?

04:48.880 --> 04:50.541
Well, that's a
fair question.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.046
My guess is
the perpetrator

04:52.090 --> 04:55.753
wanted a little something
to memorialize the occasion.

04:58.890 --> 05:02.462
Something like,
perhaps...

05:02.500 --> 05:06.027
one high-heeled
Jimmy Choo.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.679
Wade Crewes told you
that he worked alone

05:14.710 --> 05:16.803
when he confessed
in 1999.

05:16.850 --> 05:18.602
I think he lied.

05:18.650 --> 05:20.379
I don't_ believe that
we're looking for someone

05:20.420 --> 05:22.047
who's copying his work.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.810
I think we're looking for
someone who helped him do it.

05:48.010 --> 05:49.409
The chief of detectives
just formed

05:49.450 --> 05:50.769
a task force
on the Myrose murders.

05:50.810 --> 05:52.539
(cell phone ringtone plays)

05:52.580 --> 05:53.808
Sorry.

05:56.690 --> 05:59.386
GREGSON:
Garrity, Ramberg,
I'm pulling you in.

05:59.420 --> 06:01.559
I'm gonna detail a few other
detectives out of other units.

06:01.590 --> 06:04.684
(buzzing)
Any questions?

06:04.730 --> 06:05.924
All right, then.

06:07.160 --> 06:09.526
Captain, ifI might
venture a suggestion?

06:09.570 --> 06:11.026
You and I go
to Sing Sing,

06:11.070 --> 06:12.162
talk to
Wade Crewes, hmm?

06:12.200 --> 06:13.599
We now know_
there's a connection

06:13.640 --> 06:15.130
between the old murders
and the new ones,

06:15.170 --> 06:17.866
and Crewes is the one man
who can tell us what it is.

06:17.910 --> 06:20.470
Waste of time. He'd tell you he
was partnered with the Taliban

06:20.510 --> 06:21.909
if it'd shave time
off his sentence.

06:21.940 --> 06:24.909
And we don't know
there's a connection.

06:24.950 --> 06:27.418
Oh. The missing
high heel.

06:27.450 --> 06:30.681
Don't people lose shoes
all the time?
Not $1,000 ones.

06:30.720 --> 06:32.859
I-I have to say, you seem
strangely reluctant

06:32.890 --> 06:34.050
to pursue a
promising lead.

06:34.090 --> 06:36.820
Because it's not
a lead yet.

06:36.860 --> 06:38.589
It's not
an anything yet.

06:38.630 --> 06:40.097
Maybe you'll turn out
to be right,

06:40.130 --> 06:41.654
but talking
to Wade Crewes

06:41.700 --> 06:43.122
is not going
to get you there.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.899
I promise you.

06:44.930 --> 06:46.090
(cell phone buzzing)

06:46.130 --> 06:47.939
Oh.

06:47.970 --> 06:49.904
Watson, I admire
your persistence,

06:49.940 --> 06:52.101
but the reception
is really... where... am.

06:52.140 --> 06:54.529
Really? 'Cause my
phone's working fine.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.445
Four bars
and everything.

06:56.480 --> 06:57.640
Let me guess:

06:57.680 --> 07:00.046
You want me to wait right here

07:00.080 --> 07:02.514
while you get another coffee.
Or you could just leave.

07:02.550 --> 07:03.744
Okay, I don't think ditching me

07:03.790 --> 07:05.143
is the most
constructive approach.

07:05.190 --> 07:06.612
Well, it solved the
problem, didn't it?

07:06.660 --> 07:08.116
It's quite simple, Watson.

07:08.160 --> 07:09.980
Stop trying to reach me,
and things can go back

07:10.030 --> 07:12.123
to the way that they were.
You know I'm not gonna do that.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.957
Well, then, welcome to
our new arrangement.

07:14.000 --> 07:16.468
Same as the old one, without
the goodwill that you'd accrued.

07:16.500 --> 07:17.967
I will obey the letter
of our agreement.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.991
I will check in with you
every two hours,

07:20.040 --> 07:22.167
at which point you can
give me whatever drug
tests that you want.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.737
My bodily fluids are
all at your disposal.
That's not how this works...

07:24.770 --> 07:25.862
I'm not finished.
Oh, you're not finished.

07:25.910 --> 07:27.172
What is not at your disposal

07:27.210 --> 07:28.609
are the details
of my personal life,

07:28.640 --> 07:30.107
which are uniquely my own,

07:30.150 --> 07:32.004
and which I will not cheapen
by allowing them to become

07:32.050 --> 07:34.109
grist for your
tedious recovery mill.

07:34.150 --> 07:35.845
All right, then.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.484
That's that.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.715
I will check in with you
in two hours.

07:39.760 --> 07:40.909
Hmm.

07:42.060 --> 07:43.186
Holmes...

07:43.230 --> 07:44.879
Bell's got something.

07:44.930 --> 07:47.899
All right, CCS dug
through the Myroses' laptop.

07:47.930 --> 07:49.659
They each got a bunch
of threatening e-mails

07:49.700 --> 07:51.167
from the same anonymous account.

07:51.200 --> 07:53.668
We traced the IP address
to a guy named Julian Walsh.

07:53.700 --> 07:55.167
Guy's a contractor.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.031
The Myroses hired him
to remodel their kitchen,

07:57.070 --> 07:58.901
and then fired him
six weeks later.

07:58.940 --> 08:00.498
They filed a complaint
about his work

08:00.540 --> 08:02.030
and withheld payment.

08:02.080 --> 08:04.503
And Walsh responded
with anonymous threats.

08:04.550 --> 08:06.040
We ran him through the NCIC.

08:06.080 --> 08:07.274
He did time _
for weapons possessmn

08:07.320 --> 08:08.719
and sexual assault.

08:08.750 --> 08:11.639
We're going to go
talk to him now.

08:11.690 --> 08:13.658
That's a lead.

08:13.690 --> 08:15.851
BELL: _
"When you least expect it,
I'll be there

08:15.890 --> 08:17.289
"to give you what's yours.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.127
"A pair of pliers
and a handful of rusty nails

08:19.160 --> 08:20.525
are the only tools I need."

08:20.560 --> 08:21.720
Sound familiar, Mr. Walsh?

08:21.760 --> 08:24.092
Okay, yes, I sent those e-mails.

08:24.130 --> 08:25.995
But that doesn't mean
I killed anybody.

08:26.030 --> 08:28.066
Well, you talked
about killing people,

08:28.100 --> 08:30.307
and they wound up dead.
I'm sure you can follow along.

08:30.340 --> 08:32.205
I don't know
what you want me to say.

08:32.240 --> 08:33.730
BELL:
Well, listen,

08:33.780 --> 08:35.008
we'll be more inclined
to believe you

08:35.040 --> 08:36.541
if you gave us
your whereabouts

08:36.580 --> 08:38.104
between 6:00
and midnight last night.

08:38.150 --> 08:40.812
I watched TV, and then
I went to bed by 11:00.

08:40.850 --> 08:42.841
I live alone, but that
doesn't mean I did anything.

08:45.190 --> 08:46.919
BELL:
You understand why
we're here, Julian.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.916
The people you threatened
in these e-mails are now dead.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.178
JULIAN:
Yeah, well...

08:51.230 --> 08:53.994
You with us here?
Yep.

08:54.030 --> 08:56.794
I just want to see if
the house has a basement.

08:56.830 --> 08:58.593
Walsh has looked at
the floor three times

08:58.630 --> 08:59.938
since he started talking.

08:59.970 --> 09:01.562
He's clearly nervous.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.568
I bet whatever he's
hiding is down there.

09:03.610 --> 09:06.670
Okay, I'll cut this off
and get us a warrant.

09:06.710 --> 09:08.575
And give him time to
get rid of the evidence?

09:08.610 --> 09:10.248
Mr. Walsh, do you have
a lavatory I might use?

09:10.280 --> 09:12.840
Huh?
Bathroom.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.713
Yeah, upstairs.

09:31.830 --> 09:34.162
(chain clinks)

09:35.170 --> 09:37.638
(chain links rattling)

09:41.640 --> 09:44.006
(chain links rattling)

09:50.850 --> 09:52.249
Identify yourself.

09:52.290 --> 09:54.758
(whimpering)

09:55.790 --> 09:58.122
(woman speaking Russian)

10:07.040 --> 10:08.291
What the hell are you doing?

10:08.340 --> 10:10.831
He lied.

10:10.870 --> 10:13.202
When he said that
he lived alone.

10:17.010 --> 10:18.341
(whimpers)

10:20.420 --> 10:22.240
Shh.

10:22.280 --> 10:24.589
(speaking Russian)

10:28.460 --> 10:29.984
Arrest him!

10:30.030 --> 10:31.327
GREGSON:
Arrest him.
Turn to the wall now.

10:31.360 --> 10:35.057
(speaking Russian)
Shh, shh, shh...

10:35.100 --> 10:37.364
(sobbing)

10:38.970 --> 10:40.665
WATSON:
You have to understand,

10:40.700 --> 10:42.736
this my nuclear option.

10:42.770 --> 10:46.069
I've never felt the need to
go to a client's rehab before.

10:46.110 --> 10:49.671
Yeah, but Mr. Holmes
isn't a typical client.

10:49.710 --> 10:51.871
He just won't
let me help him.

10:51.910 --> 10:53.810
He's so adamant about
being above all that.

10:53.850 --> 10:57.809
Yeah, he does make it difficult
to keep one's cool, doesn't he?

10:57.850 --> 10:59.852
Please.
Thank you.

11:00.990 --> 11:02.355
I know from his records

11:02.390 --> 11:05.223
he spent two hours a day
in therapy with you.

11:05.260 --> 11:07.854
Did he ever mention
a woman named Irene?

11:07.900 --> 11:11.358
Sherlock Holmes
was here for six months,

11:11.400 --> 11:15.097
and in that time,
he mentioned no women, no men,

11:15.140 --> 11:16.869
no names, no dates.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.832
I don't believe I learned

11:18.870 --> 11:21.407
a single significant
thing about him.

11:22.880 --> 11:24.006
(siren wails)

11:24.050 --> 11:26.439
(woman sobbing,
speaking Russian)

11:26.480 --> 11:28.710
(Holmes speaks Russian)

11:28.750 --> 11:29.910
(woman sobbing)

11:37.290 --> 11:38.985
Her name is Katya.

11:39.030 --> 11:42.397
She came to the US.
to work as a prostitute.

11:42.430 --> 11:45.365
Her handlers sold her to Julian
Walsh a couple of weeks ago.

11:47.200 --> 11:49.998
She told me that he has been
to see her every night

11:50.040 --> 11:51.200
since he purchased her.

11:51.240 --> 11:54.004
You can fill in
the blanks.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.769
Most evenings,
he slept in her room.

11:55.810 --> 11:57.744
Including last night.

11:57.780 --> 12:00.442
Walsh's sex slave is his alibi
for the Myrose killings?

12:00.480 --> 12:01.879
I'm afraid it
looks that way.

12:01.920 --> 12:03.319
Respectfully,
I suggest that

12:03.350 --> 12:05.079
we bring everyone
on the task force

12:05.120 --> 12:07.384
into a comprehensive review
of the original files.

12:07.420 --> 12:08.956
Because of the shoe thing?

12:08.990 --> 12:10.287
I'm not diverting
an entire task force

12:10.330 --> 12:12.082
for a missing high heel.

12:12.130 --> 12:13.757
Four missing high heels,

12:13.800 --> 12:16.052
if you count the
original crime scene.

12:16.100 --> 12:18.421
You never recovered the original
murder weapon, did you?

12:18.470 --> 12:21.234
No, Crewes said he dumped it
in the East River.

12:21.270 --> 12:23.534
Well, let's go and see
if he was telling the truth.

12:23.570 --> 12:25.333
(siren whoops)

12:25.370 --> 12:26.928
GREGSON:
Holmes,

12:26.980 --> 12:28.129
what are we doing
down here?

12:28.180 --> 12:30.000
Ballistics comparison, hmm?

12:30.050 --> 12:33.417
This is the original report
from the original murders.

12:33.450 --> 12:35.441
BELL: You gonna
do it by eye?

12:35.480 --> 12:38.040
The human eye
is a precision instrument.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.309
It can detect
grooves and lands on a slug

12:41.360 --> 12:44.079
more efficiently
than any computer.

12:45.330 --> 12:46.922
In both of these killings,

12:46.960 --> 12:48.552
and in last night's murders,
the slugs had

12:48.600 --> 12:50.966
the same distinctive dent
on the case head.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.560
It was caused by some sort of
defect in the gun's barrel.

12:53.600 --> 12:57.900
The grooves and lands show
a steep twist to the left.

12:57.940 --> 12:59.464
See for yourself.

13:02.010 --> 13:03.841
Now, you can wait
for the computers

13:03.880 --> 13:05.802
to confirm it
if you like,

13:05.850 --> 13:07.818
but Wade Crewes lied to you
about that murder weapon.

13:07.850 --> 13:09.317
He didn't dump it.

13:09.350 --> 13:11.215
And wherever it's been
for the last 13 years,

13:11.250 --> 13:13.810
it was used last night
to kill the Myroses.

13:13.860 --> 13:17.352
This is no longer a theory,
Captain; this is a fact.

13:17.390 --> 13:19.995
These cases are
indelibly linked.

13:24.870 --> 13:26.599
Terry?

13:26.630 --> 13:28.837
What are you doing here?

13:28.870 --> 13:30.132
I figured maybe
you could tell me that.

13:30.170 --> 13:31.603
I got a message
saying to come here

13:31.640 --> 13:33.005
to review the
Wade Crewes murders.

13:33.040 --> 13:34.109
I didn't call you.

13:34.140 --> 13:35.209
I did.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.969
Ms. D'Amico was your partner

13:37.010 --> 13:38.944
when you investigated
the original murders in '99.

13:38.980 --> 13:40.845
Surely it's possible she
would help shed some light

13:40.880 --> 13:42.211
on the situation.

13:42.250 --> 13:43.888
We know that
last night's murders

13:43.920 --> 13:46.115
were connected
to the ones from 1999.

13:46.150 --> 13:48.516
The way I see it, this can mean
one of two things:

13:48.560 --> 13:50.881
First is that Wade Crewes
had an accomplice

13:50.930 --> 13:52.283
that he _never told
the police about.

13:52.330 --> 13:53.991
For whatever
reason, that guy

13:54.030 --> 13:55.895
started up again
13 years later.

13:55.930 --> 13:57.522
Second option:

13:57.570 --> 13:59.868
Crewes committed the original
crimes all by himself,

13:59.900 --> 14:01.561
but got someone to do
last night's killing

14:01.600 --> 14:04.137
so he could maybe get
his sentence commuted.

14:04.170 --> 14:05.637
There is another possibility:

14:05.670 --> 14:08.138
Wade Crewes is innocent,
the wrong man is in prison

14:08.180 --> 14:09.875
and the original killer
is back at it.

14:09.910 --> 14:11.172
D'AMICO (laughing):
No way.

14:11.210 --> 14:13.349
Crewes did it;
he told us he did it.

14:13.380 --> 14:15.211
It wouldn't be the first
false confession in the annals

14:15.250 --> 14:16.342
of crime, would it?
GREGSON:
Enough.

14:16.380 --> 14:18.018
This isn't philosophy class.

14:18.050 --> 14:21.213
We don't need to debate
every possibility.

14:21.260 --> 14:24.957
Whatever's going on, I guarantee
you Crewes is not innocent.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.595
Now, I'm going
to go talk to him,

14:27.630 --> 14:29.222
see ifI can shake his tree,

14:29.260 --> 14:30.966
figure out if
he's working with somebody.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.366
Garrity, Ramberg, I want you
to grab a couple of guys

14:33.400 --> 14:35.493
and start digging
into some old case files.

14:35.540 --> 14:37.929
Bell, I want you to look
into the suspects from '99.

14:37.970 --> 14:40.029
All right?
We're done here.

14:46.510 --> 14:50.048
Um, I'd like to go with
you to interview Crewes.

14:50.090 --> 14:51.910
Fine.
You can observe.

14:51.950 --> 14:53.952
Um, not to pry, but
did everything end well

14:53.990 --> 14:55.480
with you and
Detective D'Amico?

14:55.520 --> 14:57.078
I noticed that you didn't
greet each other,

14:57.130 --> 14:58.483
you didn't say
good-bye...

14:58.530 --> 15:01.090
You just got done dissecting
one of my old cases

15:01.130 --> 15:03.598
in front of a room
full of people.

15:03.630 --> 15:06.497
How about you leave
my old partnership alone.

15:08.240 --> 15:11.937
You want insights
into Sherlock Holmes?

15:11.970 --> 15:13.130
I'll give you an insight:

15:13.180 --> 15:15.603
He's childish and self-absorbed.

15:15.640 --> 15:19.076
He spent nearly every group
session in total silence.

15:19.110 --> 15:20.577
He was, bar none,

15:20.620 --> 15:22.349
the least cooperative patient
I've ever had.

15:22.380 --> 15:26.180
Yeah, I read the same
from most of your colleagues.

15:27.490 --> 15:29.082
Who's that?

15:30.730 --> 15:32.288
Oh, the gardener.

15:32.330 --> 15:34.298
Uh, I think his
name's E... Edson.

15:34.330 --> 15:36.025
Edison?

15:36.060 --> 15:38.369
Why?

15:38.400 --> 15:40.197
WATSON :
Hey, there.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.593
How you doing?

15:41.640 --> 15:43.039
Good.

15:43.070 --> 15:44.708
Hey, is that
beekeeping equipment?

15:44.740 --> 15:46.162
Yeah.

15:46.210 --> 15:48.030
Calms them down.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.446
Everyone tells me
I probably should

15:50.480 --> 15:52.107
just spray the hives
with poison,

15:52.150 --> 15:55.608
but what can I say?
I find them interesting.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.982
This one's getting
a little big, though.

15:58.020 --> 16:01.183
Gonna move it out to the woods.

16:01.220 --> 16:03.529
There was a client back here
a little while ago, uh,

16:03.560 --> 16:05.425
who was also interested
in beekeeping.

16:05.460 --> 16:07.189
Sure.

16:07.230 --> 16:08.390
You mean Sherlock.

16:08.430 --> 16:10.125
Yeah.
You knew him?

16:10.170 --> 16:12.388
He used to tell_ me _I was
the only person in this place

16:12.430 --> 16:13.590
without an agenda.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.437
I took that to mean
he liked me.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.461
CREWES: I wasn't sure
if you and your partner

16:18.510 --> 16:19.465
would show up here.

16:19.510 --> 16:21.034
You were expecting us?

16:21.080 --> 16:22.399
Of course.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.305
We get the newspapers
in here, Detective.

16:24.350 --> 16:25.544
Oh-- wait a minute.

16:25.580 --> 16:27.411
It's Captain now, isn't it?

16:27.450 --> 16:31.011
I _read about last
night's murders.

16:31.050 --> 16:32.745
I knew you'd come see me.

16:32.790 --> 16:34.451
Then I'll cut
right to the chase:

16:34.490 --> 16:36.549
What's the name of the guy
you're working with?

16:36.590 --> 16:39.559
I gave up anger
a long time ago.

16:39.590 --> 16:42.354
It was one of
the only rational responses

16:42.400 --> 16:45.289
to the irrational situation
my life had become.

16:45.330 --> 16:49.198
But you, standing there,
accusing me...

16:49.240 --> 16:52.334
I think that's the perfect test
for my progress, isn't it?

16:52.370 --> 16:54.736
What, exactly, do you have
to be angry about?

16:54.780 --> 16:57.476
As we both well know,
I'm an innocent man.

16:57.510 --> 17:00.513
I spent years thinking
about how to prove it,

17:00.550 --> 17:02.643
and when I finally
gave up the quest,

17:02.680 --> 17:05.285
the world decided
to prove it for me.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.288
It's like the man says:

17:07.320 --> 17:11.051
"The strongest of all warriors
are these two:

17:11.090 --> 17:12.751
Time and Patience."

17:12.790 --> 17:15.054
Tolstoy's War and Peace.

17:15.100 --> 17:16.829
Your file says
you were

17:16.860 --> 17:20.068
functionally illiterate when
you confessed to the murders.

17:20.100 --> 17:22.796
I had plenty
of raw intelligence.

17:22.840 --> 17:25.229
What I didn't have were
parents or a school system

17:25.270 --> 17:26.532
that gave a damn about me.

17:26.570 --> 17:29.403
And my confession,
well, I gave that

17:29.440 --> 17:31.647
after my Legal Aid lawyer
convinced me

17:31.680 --> 17:34.319
it was the only way of avoiding
a guaranteed life sentence.

17:34.350 --> 17:36.318
He wouldn't take the time
to prove my alibi.

17:36.350 --> 17:37.487
GREGSON:
Carla Figueroa?

17:37.520 --> 17:38.782
Please.

17:38.820 --> 17:40.708
She recanted
the second we asked her

17:40.760 --> 17:42.557
to make an
official statement.

17:42.590 --> 17:44.581
Well, of course she did!
Carla was married!

17:44.630 --> 17:46.689
If she admitted she was with me
during the murders, well,

17:46.730 --> 17:48.322
that would be the end
of that, wouldn't it?

17:48.360 --> 17:51.329
We found your fingerprints
at the scene

17:51.370 --> 17:54.498
of the third murders
in '99, remember?

17:54.540 --> 17:56.861
You mean you put my prints

17:56.900 --> 18:00.472
at the scene
of the third murders in 1999.

18:00.510 --> 18:03.673
You and I both know that
evidence was planted.

18:03.710 --> 18:07.111
Worked out pretty well for you,
didn't it, Captain?

18:08.320 --> 18:11.619
_ I'm not even
gomg to respond to that.

18:11.650 --> 18:13.811
The next time you and I
speak to each other,

18:13.860 --> 18:16.511
we'll be standing
on the courthouse steps,

18:16.560 --> 18:20.428
after I'm exonerated of
every charge against me.

18:26.270 --> 18:27.794
I know he values
his privacy,

18:27.840 --> 18:29.694
but there are some things that
Sherlock needs to deal with,

18:29.740 --> 18:31.264
if he really wants
to get better.

18:31.310 --> 18:32.265
Are there?

18:32.310 --> 18:33.800
Can you just tell me--

18:33.840 --> 18:36.274
did he ever mention
a woman named Irene?

18:36.310 --> 18:38.301
Can't say he did.

18:40.580 --> 18:42.719
Thank you very much
for your time.

18:51.360 --> 18:55.456
He left some things behind--
personal stuff.

18:55.500 --> 18:59.766
I held onto it all, just in case
he ever came back for it.

19:02.600 --> 19:04.909
Maybe you can give
these back to him.

19:10.810 --> 19:13.779
GREGSON: 1020 3lst Avenue,
Astoria, Queens.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.549
You want to tell me
why we're here?

19:15.580 --> 19:17.946
Last known address
of Carla Figueroa.

19:17.990 --> 19:19.810
I thought we could have
a quick word with her,

19:19.850 --> 19:21.317
see if there's anything
to the notion

19:21.360 --> 19:23.225
that she recanted
Wade Crewes's alibi

19:23.260 --> 19:25.524
to save her marriage.

19:25.560 --> 19:27.221
I'm just being thorough.

19:27.260 --> 19:29.524
Go right ahead;
I'm just telling you,

19:29.560 --> 19:31.369
I'm not gonna be here
when you get back.

19:31.400 --> 19:34.198
Why are you so unwilling to even
consider the possibility

19:34.240 --> 19:35.491
that Crewes is innocent?

19:35.540 --> 19:36.791
Is it pride?

19:39.440 --> 19:41.601
That's precisely why my input
is so valuable.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.949
We put Crewes away
on good evidence.

19:43.980 --> 19:46.574
His fingerprints were all
over a mug that got broken,

19:46.610 --> 19:49.374
while he was killing
his last two victims.

19:49.420 --> 19:51.342
The same mug that he
accused you of planting.

19:51.390 --> 19:52.584
Now, when he said that,

19:52.620 --> 19:53.985
you swallowed twice
before responding,

19:54.020 --> 19:56.557
like you were trying
to clear your throat, hmm?

19:56.590 --> 19:57.921
And when you
did answer him,

19:57.960 --> 19:59.655
your vocal intonation
was markedly different.

19:59.690 --> 20:01.226
Now, if I wasn't
watching you,

20:01.260 --> 20:02.955
someone I have
the highest respect for,

20:03.000 --> 20:05.218
I would think that that was
the response of someone

20:05.270 --> 20:07.261
with something to hide.

20:08.540 --> 20:10.838
It sounds like you
think that anyway.

20:10.870 --> 20:12.758
(tapping on car)
My dad's gonna go ape

20:12.810 --> 20:14.300
when he sees you guys
parked in our driveway.

20:14.340 --> 20:15.568
Just saying.

20:15.610 --> 20:16.929
We're not going to leave
the car here;

20:16.980 --> 20:18.345
we're with the police.

20:18.380 --> 20:19.972
We need to speak
with Carla Figueroa.

20:20.010 --> 20:23.810
Uh, my mom died
four years ago.

20:23.850 --> 20:25.647
Leukemia.

20:25.690 --> 20:27.817
Oh, I'm so sorry
to hear that.

20:27.860 --> 20:29.885
My dad's inside, if you
want to talk to him.

20:29.920 --> 20:31.888
No, no, no.
It had to be her.

20:31.930 --> 20:33.454
Uh... thanks.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.694
Sorry to bother you.

20:37.030 --> 20:40.989
HOLMES: Well, if she was lying,
her secret died with her.

20:41.040 --> 20:43.668
She wasn't lying.

20:43.710 --> 20:46.804
Oh, Wade Crewes,
he put on a good show.

20:46.840 --> 20:48.637
Oh, I'll give him that.

20:48.680 --> 20:51.274
But if you really want to
know why I won't waste time

20:51.310 --> 20:53.471
trying to find out if
Wade Crewes is innocent,

20:53.520 --> 20:54.612
watch the tapes.

20:54.650 --> 20:56.345
He held his tongue,

20:56.380 --> 20:58.883
but he couldn't help
gloating about it.

20:58.920 --> 21:01.980
That's the real Wade Crewes.

21:04.060 --> 21:06.358
(starts engine)

21:06.390 --> 21:08.449
GREGSON (on tape): You were
dressed like a house painter.

21:10.100 --> 21:12.295
CREWES (on tape):
Eh, doesn't ring a bell.

21:12.330 --> 21:15.299
Maybe I should take a look at
those crime scene photos again.

21:15.340 --> 21:17.638
Might jar my memory.

21:17.670 --> 21:19.968
(door opens, shuts)

21:20.010 --> 21:21.773
(footsteps approaching)

21:21.810 --> 21:23.698
Surprised I didn't
see you today, Watson.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.708
I sent you a text with my exact
location every two hours.

21:26.750 --> 21:28.069
I was busy.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.712
I left some urine
in your room.

21:29.750 --> 21:32.719
Tell me it's in a cup.

21:32.750 --> 21:35.719
(video continues indistinctly)

21:53.880 --> 21:57.338
D'AMICO (on tape):
Today is April 3, 1999,

21:57.380 --> 22:00.349
and the time is 2200 hours.

22:00.380 --> 22:02.018
I'm interviewing Wade Crewes

22:02.050 --> 22:06.419
in connection with the deaths
of David and Lyla Dawson.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.657
CREWES:
So, where do we start?

22:08.690 --> 22:10.885
D'AMICO:
How about with the fact

22:10.930 --> 22:13.490
that you used to deliver pizzas
to the Dawsons

22:13.530 --> 22:15.623
back when you were
holding down a job?

22:15.660 --> 22:18.527
Is that how
you scouted them out?

22:21.840 --> 22:25.401
Black, just like you asked for.

22:26.810 --> 22:28.801
Cheers.

22:36.420 --> 22:37.978
(knocking)

22:38.020 --> 22:40.386
We're putting our differences
aside. Come downstairs.

22:40.420 --> 22:41.978
If you need my help,
you know I'm game,

22:42.020 --> 22:43.783
but if this is
some sort of prank...

22:43.830 --> 22:45.957
Watson, I think I've learned
something, and if I'm right,

22:45.990 --> 22:48.390
it is bigger than any
dispute between you and me.

22:48.430 --> 22:49.920
It has a moral component.

22:49.960 --> 22:52.963
You're good with
that sort of thing.

22:53.000 --> 22:54.536
In the first interrogation
of Wade Crewes,

22:54.570 --> 22:57.061
they served him his coffee
in a disposable cup.

22:57.100 --> 22:58.533
In the second
interrogation,

22:58.570 --> 23:00.106
they served it to
him in that mug.

23:00.140 --> 23:01.835
Black with a white
stripe around the rim.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.768
The second interrogation
took place

23:03.810 --> 23:05.539
shortly after the
second pair of murders.

23:05.580 --> 23:08.549
At the third crime scene,
they found physical evidence

23:08.580 --> 23:10.411
that implicated Wade Crewes.

23:10.450 --> 23:14.079
A fingerprint
on a shattered mug.

23:14.120 --> 23:18.819
Black with a white stripe
around the rim.

23:18.860 --> 23:21.556
My God, it's
the same mug.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.420
The evidence was planted,

23:23.470 --> 23:26.724
and it was Captain Gregson
who gave him that mug.

23:37.550 --> 23:39.177
I've been struggling
with something.

23:39.210 --> 23:41.576
Oh, good morning
to you, too.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.815
Why did you tell me
to look at the tape?

23:43.850 --> 23:45.215
Did you honestly think
I wouldn't notice?

23:45.250 --> 23:46.888
The mug.

23:46.920 --> 23:48.615
The one that you
handed to Wade Crewes

23:48.660 --> 23:50.013
during your second
interrogation of him.

23:50.060 --> 23:51.982
It's the same one
that your men

23:52.030 --> 23:53.759
found at the
third crime scene.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.468
I want you to
understand,

24:02.500 --> 24:05.003
I take no pleasure in
pursuing this line of inquiry,

24:05.040 --> 24:07.099
but I am obliged to
pursue the facts,

24:07.140 --> 24:09.472
and the facts are you
and Detective D'Amico

24:09.510 --> 24:11.569
had possession of that
mug before it showed up

24:11.610 --> 24:12.907
at the third crime scene.

24:15.020 --> 24:18.478
As I said yesterday, I have
the utmost respect for you.

24:18.520 --> 24:20.147
If evidence was planted,

24:20.190 --> 24:22.988
I'm sure it was the
result of frustration.

24:23.020 --> 24:25.523
A mistake that the
perpetrator or perpetrators

24:25.560 --> 24:27.152
would no doubt
wish to take back

24:27.190 --> 24:29.021
especially now that
it seems possible

24:29.060 --> 24:33.224
that Mr. Crewes may
well be innocent.

24:34.670 --> 24:36.535
I don't want to...

24:36.570 --> 24:38.731
You know that I will
find out the truth

24:38.770 --> 24:42.900
and the truth may well
be... just compromising.

24:42.940 --> 24:45.875
Every cop gets offered
a few perks.

24:45.910 --> 24:48.049
Free lunch here,
gym membership there.

24:48.080 --> 24:51.083
I never took a single one,

24:51.120 --> 24:55.056
and I sure as_hell
never planted eVIdence.

24:55.090 --> 24:58.059
Well, then, could you
or your former partner

24:58.090 --> 24:59.626
please explain to
me how that mug

24:59.660 --> 25:00.820
showed up at the
crime scene?

25:15.940 --> 25:17.908
Hey.

25:17.950 --> 25:19.747
How'd it go?

25:19.780 --> 25:21.941
Captain Gregson got
the warning he deserved.

25:21.980 --> 25:23.618
Now to solve the case.

25:23.650 --> 25:26.244
Hold on, I...
I've got something for you.

25:31.660 --> 25:33.287
You've been to Hemdale.

25:33.330 --> 25:35.218
Edson saved them for you.

25:35.260 --> 25:37.990
And were they everything
that you hoped, hmm?

25:38.030 --> 25:40.590
Do you understand me now?

25:40.640 --> 25:42.232
I didn't read them.

25:42.270 --> 25:43.828
I was tempted.

25:43.870 --> 25:45.599
They're from Irene;
how could I not be?

25:45.640 --> 25:47.005
But whatever happened,
this is not

25:47.040 --> 25:48.735
how I want
to find out about it.

25:48.780 --> 25:50.133
A show of restraint.
When...

25:50.180 --> 25:52.341
(sighs)

25:52.380 --> 25:54.245
If you are ready
to talk about it,

25:54.280 --> 25:56.748
I'd very much like to know,

25:56.780 --> 25:59.044
but I'm not going to ask you
about it anymore.

25:59.090 --> 26:00.785
I just thought
you might want these.

26:00.820 --> 26:02.310
Indeed I do.

26:02.360 --> 26:04.624
Thank you, Watson.

26:12.900 --> 26:14.959
Hey, what are you doing?

26:15.000 --> 26:17.264
I left those at Hemdale
because I didn't want them.

26:17.300 --> 26:18.836
I don't understand.
Aren't those important?

26:18.870 --> 26:20.360
Remember your promise:
no further discussion

26:20.410 --> 26:22.332
of this matter
until I bring it up.

26:22.380 --> 26:24.348
Fine. Fine.

26:24.380 --> 26:28.316
(sighs) You mentioned something
about a case that needs solving?

26:30.020 --> 26:31.749
This is Victor Nardin.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.883
He was an early suspect
in the '99 home invasions.

26:33.920 --> 26:35.854
He's been in prison
for the last 12 years,

26:35.890 --> 26:37.983
which could explain why the home
invasions miraculously stopped.

26:38.030 --> 26:40.021
He was released
three weeks ago,

26:40.060 --> 26:41.755
which could explain
why they've resumed.

26:41.800 --> 26:44.223
How are the police
not looking for this guy?

26:44.270 --> 26:46.090
They are; they just
can't find him.

26:46.130 --> 26:49.236
Nardin left his group home on
Staten Island two weeks ago

26:49.270 --> 26:51.306
and has not checked in
with his parole officer.

26:51.340 --> 26:52.967
Those letters are Cyrillic.

26:53.010 --> 26:54.637
Is he in a gang or something?

26:54.680 --> 26:56.636
No, rabid
football fan.

26:56.680 --> 26:58.773
The tattoos
are the names

26:58.810 --> 27:01.119
and jersey numbers
of famous players

27:01.150 --> 27:02.640
from Terek Grozny.

27:02.680 --> 27:04.784
It is Chechnya's
premier football club.

27:04.820 --> 27:06.981
And how are they gonna help us
find Victor Nardin?

27:07.020 --> 27:09.318
I believe they
already have.

27:09.360 --> 27:12.056
Nardin has spent a
decade in prison,

27:12.090 --> 27:14.126
bereft of his
favorite obsession.

27:14.160 --> 27:17.664
Wherever he is, he will want
to watch his beloved team.

27:17.700 --> 27:20.260
There aren't that
many bars in New York

27:20.300 --> 27:23.360
that have a satellite
feed of Chechen football.

27:23.400 --> 27:25.209
Three, actually.

27:25.240 --> 27:27.333
All of them
in Brighton Beach.

27:27.370 --> 27:30.976
All of them within walking
distance of Mayweather Hotel.

27:31.010 --> 27:32.238
"Rooms by the hour,

27:32.280 --> 27:34.271
week or month. Cash only."

27:39.250 --> 27:40.956
(American accent):
Yeah. I got a delivery

27:40.990 --> 27:42.685
for one of your guests.
I need a room number.

27:42.720 --> 27:43.857
Victor Nardin.

27:45.060 --> 27:46.948
No Nardin?

27:46.990 --> 27:48.890
Hold... hold on.

27:48.930 --> 27:51.160
Oh, no, no.

27:51.200 --> 27:52.224
I got the wrong name.

27:52.270 --> 27:55.296
Victor Jones.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.138
282. Thank you.

28:08.850 --> 28:10.841
Hey.

28:13.420 --> 28:15.012
What gives?

28:15.060 --> 28:18.029
Tommy, we can't just talk
at the precinct?

28:18.060 --> 28:19.379
Not about this.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.956
You planted that
mug, didn't you?

28:23.000 --> 28:25.059
Yeah.

28:25.100 --> 28:28.797
We knew it was him, but
we couldn't nail him.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.161
So, after the second time
you brought him in,

28:31.210 --> 28:33.098
you kept that mug

28:33.140 --> 28:34.471
just in case.

28:34.510 --> 28:36.978
Good to have a trump card, huh?

28:37.010 --> 28:39.001
I always assumed you knew that.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.018
I knew it was convenient,

28:41.050 --> 28:43.018
piece of evidence
to turn up like that.

28:43.050 --> 28:44.984
I chalked it up
to our good fortune

28:45.020 --> 28:47.215
because I thought
we had our guy.
We did.

28:47.250 --> 28:50.287
Well, I was a lot more sure
about that then than I am now.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.481
'Cause somebody is out
there killing people

28:52.530 --> 28:54.748
with the same
murder weapon, Terry.

28:56.160 --> 28:57.821
What if we were wrong?

28:57.870 --> 29:00.395
If that were true--
and that is still a big "if"

29:00.430 --> 29:02.933
as far as I'm concerned--
there are ways around that.

29:02.970 --> 29:05.768
Whoa, I'm not here
to plan a cover-up.

29:05.810 --> 29:08.131
If we put an
innocent man in jail,

29:08.180 --> 29:09.909
I'm not keeping quiet about it.

29:09.940 --> 29:11.271
All right,
let's just forget

29:11.310 --> 29:14.040
about the fact
that I could go to jail.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.776
You worked that
task force in '99.

29:16.820 --> 29:18.913
How do you think that's
going to play for your career?

29:18.950 --> 29:20.315
I'll be done; doesn't matter.

29:20.350 --> 29:22.318
If I let this
happen on my watch,

29:22.360 --> 29:23.952
I'm owning up to it.

29:23.990 --> 29:25.423
(phone ringing)

29:25.460 --> 29:28.224
Fair warning, partner.

29:29.460 --> 29:31.928
Mr. Jones?

29:31.970 --> 29:34.336
Mr. Jones,
(coughs) you have a message

29:34.370 --> 29:36.565
from the front desk.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.909
He's not here.

29:38.940 --> 29:41.238
IfI lived here, I
wouldn't be here, either.

29:43.210 --> 29:47.340
Um, should I ask why we're
not calling the police?

29:47.380 --> 29:49.371
I found the man.

29:49.420 --> 29:52.389
I just... I just want to have
a look around.

30:02.000 --> 30:03.820
(groans)

30:03.870 --> 30:05.826
I don't believe it,
but this place smells worse

30:05.870 --> 30:07.497
than the outside.

30:07.530 --> 30:09.134
Stale cigarette smoke,

30:09.170 --> 30:11.331
cheap cologne,

30:11.370 --> 30:13.873
a whiff of
existential despair.

30:16.140 --> 30:18.142
This floor is sticky.

30:24.020 --> 30:26.944
(sniffing)

30:26.990 --> 30:30.289
Evidently, Mr. Nardin
has a drinking problem.

30:30.320 --> 30:32.550
He spills his orange juice.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.048
Ah.

30:59.090 --> 31:01.058
What?

31:01.090 --> 31:03.923
The carpet has come loose
from the floorboards here.

31:03.960 --> 31:05.279
It hasn't come loose from age.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.321
Someone has pried this up.

31:10.000 --> 31:11.991
(coughing)

31:29.380 --> 31:31.985
(phone ringing)

31:32.020 --> 31:33.510
Just a minute.

31:33.550 --> 31:35.518
(sighs)

31:35.560 --> 31:38.028
Oh. (chuckles)

31:38.060 --> 31:40.255
Captain.

31:40.290 --> 31:42.497
I need you right away.
It's happened again.

31:42.530 --> 31:45.363
A triple this time.

31:45.400 --> 31:48.528
Neighbor spotted the
body through a window.

31:48.570 --> 31:50.333
I'll be right there.

31:50.370 --> 31:52.600
And, Captain,

31:52.640 --> 31:55.302
I think I might be able
to tell you

31:55.340 --> 31:57.479
where the murder weapon is.

32:01.580 --> 32:03.116
The homeowners were
Michael and Elizabeth Willis.

32:03.150 --> 32:04.481
Everything about
their deaths

32:04.520 --> 32:07.011
is consistent
with the others.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.358
And the third body?

32:08.390 --> 32:10.051
Houseguest, Garret Ames.

32:10.090 --> 32:11.955
I don't think the attacker
knew he was here.

32:11.990 --> 32:14.026
After the Willises
were shot,

32:14.060 --> 32:17.052
there was
a struggle here,

32:17.100 --> 32:18.692
and Ames was trying
to get away.

32:18.730 --> 32:22.461
Almost made it, too.

32:22.500 --> 32:25.333
Killer shot him
from right here.

32:25.370 --> 32:28.339
(sighs)

32:28.380 --> 32:31.008
Add another three
to the tally.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.574
That's all right,
Captain.

32:32.610 --> 32:34.441
I know this
is difficult.

32:34.480 --> 32:36.619
Well, at least CSU
gave us some evidence.

32:36.650 --> 32:38.140
They picked up
some cigarette butts

32:38.190 --> 32:39.487
from across the street.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.488
Neighbors saw
someone smoking.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.215
They're checking
the place out.

32:43.260 --> 32:46.149
Hopefully we'll be able
to harvest some DNA.

32:46.190 --> 32:47.748
We put a BOLO out
for Victor Nardin,

32:47.790 --> 32:49.724
and we got a warrant
for his hotel room.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.297
If the gun you saw
is the murder weapon,

32:52.330 --> 32:53.558
it's beginning

32:53.600 --> 32:56.364
to look like an
open-and-shut case.

32:56.400 --> 32:58.209
What is it?

33:00.340 --> 33:05.073
You said the killer
shot the houseguest from here.

33:05.110 --> 33:07.305
Yeah?
Yeah.

33:09.680 --> 33:12.240
Listen, I know you got your
theories about what happened,

33:12.290 --> 33:15.384
but I just want you to know
that if Wade Crewes is innocent,

33:15.420 --> 33:17.115
I'm not going to hide from that.

33:17.160 --> 33:21.153
Yeah. Sorry, Captain,
could you just give me a minute?

33:21.200 --> 33:23.794
I'm trying to tell you
something important here.

33:23.830 --> 33:26.321
Yes, but I wouldn't fall
on my sword just yet.

33:26.370 --> 33:27.689
(phone ringing)

33:30.240 --> 33:31.707
Gregson.

33:33.710 --> 33:36.270
Really?

33:36.310 --> 33:37.436
Yeah?

33:37.480 --> 33:39.573
Okay, yeah.

33:39.610 --> 33:41.419
That was Bell.

33:41.450 --> 33:44.544
Nardin returned
to his hotel room.

33:44.590 --> 33:45.716
We've got him in custody.

33:45.750 --> 33:47.615
Excellent.

33:47.650 --> 33:50.756
That should make it easier to
confirm that he didn't do this.

33:53.330 --> 33:55.548
I didn't kill those
people, okay?

33:55.600 --> 33:58.160
Victor Nardin, think fast.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.565
What are you doing?

33:59.600 --> 34:00.828
This man is innocent.

34:00.870 --> 34:02.565
Detective Bell,
a word, if you please?

34:02.600 --> 34:03.737
Why'd he hit me?

34:03.770 --> 34:06.159
Hey, stay right there.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.633
Wait, wait, wait. You assault
our perp with an orange?

34:08.680 --> 34:10.705
And that somehow has you
convinced he's innocent?

34:10.740 --> 34:12.776
I was testing a hypothesis
I began to form

34:12.810 --> 34:14.573
back in Victor Nardin's
hotel room.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.269
It was odd.

34:16.320 --> 34:17.571
Everything was
out of alignment.

34:17.620 --> 34:19.349
All his toiletries lined up

34:19.390 --> 34:20.812
on the left-hand side.

34:20.850 --> 34:23.114
The same was true of
his bedside table, his desk.

34:23.160 --> 34:25.788
So he favors his left side.
Big deal.

34:25.830 --> 34:28.799
Agreed. Out of context,
it's an utterly mundane detail.

34:28.830 --> 34:31.094
But there were these
distinctive blue marks

34:31.130 --> 34:32.529
on the ceiling
above Nardin's bed.

34:33.870 --> 34:35.428
a racquetball might make

34:35.470 --> 34:37.495
if it was thrown
repeatedly upwards.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.667
It's a common exercise _
to strengthen depth perception.

34:39.710 --> 34:41.530
The kind of thing
that you might do

34:41.580 --> 34:43.377
if you were...
Monocular.

34:43.410 --> 34:45.378
You're saying
that he was blind in one eye?

34:45.410 --> 34:47.173
In his right eye.

34:47.210 --> 34:50.179
He's learning depth perception.

34:50.220 --> 34:52.643
The man can hardly even pour
his orange juice accurately,

34:52.690 --> 34:55.488
let alone hit a moving target
at 20 feet.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.613
If he's right,
it would be hard to pull off.

34:57.660 --> 34:59.252
In the dark,
with adrenaline

34:59.290 --> 35:00.723
coursing through your
system after a fight,

35:00.760 --> 35:02.125
I'd say it was impossible.

35:02.160 --> 35:04.594
But... we've got evidence.

35:04.630 --> 35:06.166
The murder weapon,
the cigarettes...

35:06.200 --> 35:08.532
The cigarettes were planted,
obviously.

35:08.570 --> 35:10.538
You're standing on a street and
you want to put out a cigarette,

35:10.570 --> 35:12.265
how do you do it?
You drop it on the floor.

35:12.310 --> 35:13.868
You stand on it.
You flatten it.

35:13.910 --> 35:15.229
The cigarettes that we found
at the crime scene

35:15.280 --> 35:16.599
had been ground out.

35:16.640 --> 35:18.608
Victor Nardin put them out
in an ashtray.

35:18.650 --> 35:20.208
Someone took them
from his hotel room,

35:20.250 --> 35:21.808
transported them
to the crime scene,

35:21.850 --> 35:24.239
and they put the gun beneath the
floorboards before they left.

35:24.290 --> 35:26.815
Oh, so now Nardin's
been framed, too.

35:26.850 --> 35:28.283
I think that's a fair question.

35:28.320 --> 35:29.810
The only obvious culprit

35:29.860 --> 35:31.782
would be the one man
who stood to benefit

35:31.830 --> 35:33.786
from someone else being
implicated in the crimes.

35:33.830 --> 35:36.924
Wade Crewes, working in tandem
with someone on the outside.

35:36.960 --> 35:38.393
Someone with
whom he shared

35:38.430 --> 35:40.398
the location
of the murder weapon,

35:40.430 --> 35:42.534
the details
of the murders in '99.

35:42.570 --> 35:44.538
By law, he has access
to his case files.

35:44.570 --> 35:46.936
He could see a list of suspects,
pick a man to frame.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.528
You've spent the past 72 hours

35:48.580 --> 35:50.275
insisting Crewes is innocent.

35:50.310 --> 35:51.777
I've been insisting that
there's a connection.

35:51.810 --> 35:53.300
And I'm right.

35:53.350 --> 35:55.545
The framing of Nardin
is the final stroke

35:55.580 --> 35:58.640
in a plan that leads to
Wade Crewes walking free.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.715
We've got five dead bodies.

36:00.750 --> 36:03.355
Who would be willing to do that
for a guy like Crewes?

36:04.560 --> 36:06.255
I have no idea.

36:06.290 --> 36:08.190
Then you've got nothing.

36:08.230 --> 36:10.448
Believe me, no one
wants you to be right

36:10.500 --> 36:12.297
about this more than me.

36:12.330 --> 36:13.922
All you've done
is scare up

36:13.970 --> 36:15.790
_ a bunch of_
Circumstantial eVIdence

36:15.840 --> 36:17.569
that might or might not mean

36:17.600 --> 36:19.932
Nardin's been framed
by Crewes' mystery partner.

36:19.970 --> 36:21.437
And if you're right,

36:21.480 --> 36:23.675
we better identify
that partner fast,

36:23.710 --> 36:25.371
'cause if we don't,

36:25.410 --> 36:27.207
Nardin's going to eat
these charges,

36:27.250 --> 36:29.468
and then Crewes walks.

36:29.520 --> 36:31.340
FEMALE REPORTER:
The police commissioner

36:31.390 --> 36:33.210
declined comment today
on the possibility

36:33.250 --> 36:35.411
that a pair of violent
home invasions

36:35.460 --> 36:37.781
may signal the innocence
of the notorious Wade Crewes.

36:37.820 --> 36:39.356
According to
prison records,

36:39.390 --> 36:40.880
Crewes hasn't had
a Vi5itor in years.

36:40.930 --> 36:42.795
He hasn't sent a letter,
he hasn't received one.

36:42.830 --> 36:44.821
No phone calls, either.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.990
Maybe he's collaborating
with an old cellmate?

36:48.030 --> 36:49.861
Doubtful.

36:49.900 --> 36:52.960
Crewes's one and only cellmate
is serving life without parole.

36:53.010 --> 36:54.534
Whoever he's working with,

36:54.580 --> 36:56.377
he's willing to kill for him.

36:56.410 --> 36:59.607
This is no casual acquaintance.

36:59.650 --> 37:02.471
So have we been over all
of Crewes's relatives?

37:02.520 --> 37:04.385
C_rewes was raised
in group homes.

37:04.420 --> 37:05.887
He doesn't even know
his own parents.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.478
REPORTER:
You seem remarkably calm
for someone

37:07.520 --> 37:09.408
who claims to have spent
13 years in jail

37:09.460 --> 37:10.609
for crimes he didn't commit.

37:10.660 --> 37:12.685
"Things are what they are,

37:12.730 --> 37:14.857
and will be what they will be."

37:14.900 --> 37:17.619
Oscar Wilde.

37:17.660 --> 37:19.321
What?

37:19.370 --> 37:21.895
Crewes is quoting
Oscar Wilde.

37:21.940 --> 37:24.363
When he went to prison,
he was illiterate.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.867
Now he quotes Wilde
and Tolstoy.

37:28.810 --> 37:30.630
He's not just reading.

37:30.680 --> 37:32.875
He's reading at
an advanced level.

37:32.910 --> 37:35.413
Records.

37:42.490 --> 37:45.948
Someo_ne must have
taught him how to read.

37:47.660 --> 37:51.460
There _is no record of
him taking any classes.

37:51.500 --> 37:53.058
Whoever taught him

37:53.100 --> 37:55.068
must have spent quite
a bit of time with him.

37:55.100 --> 37:57.489
Lots of chats.
Time to plan.

37:57.540 --> 37:59.007
You just said he
didn't take a class.

37:59.040 --> 38:00.405
But he did
have a job.

38:00.440 --> 38:01.771
A couple of years ago,

38:01.810 --> 38:04.074
he signed up to work
at the prison library.

38:04.110 --> 38:06.943
You think someone who worked
there taught him how to read?

38:06.980 --> 38:08.971
Maybe.

38:09.020 --> 38:11.944
I seem to remember
that the library at Sing Sing

38:11.990 --> 38:15.380
was on the verge of being
shut down a few years ago.

38:18.530 --> 38:20.418
Yes. See?

38:20.460 --> 38:21.722
It only stayed open

38:21.760 --> 38:23.591
because a volunteer
advocacy group

38:23.630 --> 38:26.690
agreed to fund the library
and keep it staffed.

38:30.770 --> 38:35.605
"Literacy Initiative
for All"-- LIFA.

38:35.640 --> 38:37.938
I've seen those initials
recently.

38:42.680 --> 38:43.874
You know him?

38:46.150 --> 38:48.857
He's the son of
Carla Figueroa.

38:48.890 --> 38:51.757
The woman Crewes
had an affair with.

38:56.100 --> 38:57.590
HOLMES:
Sean Figueroa?

38:57.630 --> 38:59.120
Yeah.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.797
You're that guy.

39:00.830 --> 39:01.990
From outside
my house, right?

39:02.040 --> 39:03.598
Yeah. Sherlock Holmes.

39:03.640 --> 39:04.766
Consulting detective.

39:04.810 --> 39:07.370
This is Mr. Bell,

39:07.410 --> 39:09.901
frequent beneficiary
of said consultations.

39:09.940 --> 39:12.977
How can I help you?
You ever wonder why you
have such blue eyes, Sean?

39:13.010 --> 39:14.443
You must have.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.539
Both of your parents
are of Mexican descent,

39:16.580 --> 39:19.913
yet there you are, eyes as blue
as the fjords of Norway.

39:19.950 --> 39:21.713
Why do you want to
know about my eyes?

39:21.760 --> 39:23.819
Because that's what first
led me to believe

39:23.860 --> 39:25.851
that Wade Crewes
is your father.

39:25.890 --> 39:27.551
I suppose I'm just
wondering if

39:27.590 --> 39:29.558
that's how you arrived
at the same conclusion.

39:29.600 --> 39:31.158
I don't know what
you're talking about,

39:31.200 --> 39:32.997
but I'm busy, so...

39:33.030 --> 39:34.998
Your mother had a long-standing
affair with Crewes.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.133
I suppose, when she
fell pregnant with you,

39:37.170 --> 39:39.764
it was easy enough to pass
you off as your father's son.

39:39.810 --> 39:41.402
But, uh...

39:41.440 --> 39:42.907
can't imagine
she told you.

39:42.940 --> 39:44.999
You did find out, though.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.904
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have begun volunteering

39:46.950 --> 39:49.612
at the prison library,
where he works.

39:49.650 --> 39:51.914
Huh?

39:51.950 --> 39:53.747
You can lie
all you want, Sean.

39:53.790 --> 39:55.417
It'll be easy enough
to establish paternity.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.757
Okay.

39:56.790 --> 39:57.984
So what if he is my dad?

39:58.020 --> 39:59.624
How did you find out?

39:59.660 --> 40:01.696
My mom kept a diary.

40:01.730 --> 40:03.595
My dad didn't know
where it was hidden,

40:03.630 --> 40:04.927
but I did.

40:04.970 --> 40:06.699
After she died,
I read the whole thing.

40:06.730 --> 40:07.958
You must_have
been curious

40:08.000 --> 40:09.695
about your
real father, yeah.

40:09.740 --> 40:11.469
The notorious killer.

40:11.510 --> 40:14.638
So you volunteered.

40:14.680 --> 40:16.830
Probably just observed
for a while,

40:16.880 --> 40:19.178
then you struck up
a relationship.

40:19.210 --> 40:22.008
At some point,
you revealed the connection.

40:22.050 --> 40:24.985
And that's when Crewes
went to work on you. Yeah?

40:25.020 --> 40:26.647
How long did it take him

40:26.690 --> 40:28.749
to seduce you? Hmm?

40:28.790 --> 40:30.018
How long did it take him

40:30.060 --> 40:32.153
to talk you into killing
on his behalf?

40:32.190 --> 40:33.589
I taught him how to read.

40:33.630 --> 40:35.120
That's how it
started, yeah.

40:35.160 --> 40:36.855
But there's more
than a little bit

40:36.900 --> 40:38.663
of your father in you,
isn't there, Sean?

40:38.700 --> 40:40.167
Yeah.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.031
Enough for you
to murder five people.

40:42.070 --> 40:43.594
You must know
your father

40:43.640 --> 40:44.868
pretty well by now, hmm?

40:44.910 --> 40:46.605
How do you think
he's going to respond

40:46.640 --> 40:47.709
when my colleagues
approach him

40:47.740 --> 40:49.207
with a deal
to reduce his sentence

40:49.240 --> 40:51.037
in exchange for the name
of his accomplice?

40:51.080 --> 40:52.672
I'm done with this.
How loyal do you think

40:52.710 --> 40:53.938
your father's
going to be

40:53.980 --> 40:55.811
when you're next
on the chopping block

40:55.850 --> 40:57.579
and he's got freedom
at his fingertips?

40:57.620 --> 40:59.645
Hmm?

40:59.690 --> 41:01.817
Is he going to hesitate
for even a second

41:01.860 --> 41:04.158
before he renounces you?

41:05.530 --> 41:07.555
Will he visit you
in prison?

41:07.590 --> 41:09.922
(door buzzes open)

41:20.910 --> 41:22.969
What are those?

41:23.010 --> 41:24.272
Your trophies.

41:24.310 --> 41:27.006
From each of
the crime scenes in 1999.

41:27.050 --> 41:28.608
$1,000 shoes.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.708
Your son told us
where you hid them.

41:31.750 --> 41:33.240
Same place you
stashed that pistol.

41:33.290 --> 41:34.757
What are you
talking about?

41:34.790 --> 41:36.018
I don't have a son.

41:36.060 --> 41:38.187
His name is Sean Figueroa,

41:38.220 --> 41:40.154
and he has
a quite compelling story.

41:40.190 --> 41:42.294
GREGSON:
Five new murders, Wade.

41:42.330 --> 41:44.059
Sean's going away,

41:44.100 --> 41:46.762
and you're getting five
new conspiracy charges.

41:49.070 --> 41:50.731
No.

41:50.770 --> 41:52.909
You-you framed me.

41:52.940 --> 41:54.805
You bastard,
you framed me.
Hey, hey, back up!

41:54.840 --> 41:56.603
I'm only in here because of you!
Hey, Crewes, that's enough.

41:56.640 --> 41:57.937
You framed me, you bastard!
Back in your cell.

42:00.250 --> 42:02.309
Satisfying?

42:02.350 --> 42:04.215
You have no idea.

42:13.260 --> 42:15.956
I'm going to bed.

42:16.000 --> 42:18.298
Good night.

42:18.330 --> 42:20.821
She died.

42:20.870 --> 42:23.065
*

42:25.870 --> 42:27.633
Irene?

42:30.940 --> 42:33.170
We were quite close.

42:33.210 --> 42:36.145
I did not take
her passing well.

42:40.050 --> 42:41.859
Good night.
