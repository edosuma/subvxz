WEBVTT

01:28.755 --> 01:31.299
Only thing you're gonna catch
with those crumbs is a rat.

01:31.382 --> 01:33.635
I'm not trying to catch it.
I'm trying to feed it.

01:35.053 --> 01:37.555
Think Code Talker will mind
if I put this here till she gets back?

01:37.639 --> 01:38.723
Assuming she gets back.

01:38.807 --> 01:40.934
<i>Ay,</i> please. She's in Medical, not dead.

01:41.017 --> 01:43.228
Or they transferred her or deported her.

01:43.311 --> 01:46.898
She wasn't deported. They make you
take your sheets off before you go.

01:46.981 --> 01:49.567
519. 813.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.403
You've got mail.

01:53.655 --> 01:57.492
-741. You've got mail.
Are you still on AOL?

01:57.575 --> 01:59.661
-They're moving my hearing up.
-Mine, too.

01:59.744 --> 02:01.079
You've got mail.

02:01.412 --> 02:04.040
431. You've got mail.

02:05.416 --> 02:06.543
893.

02:07.544 --> 02:10.004
-I ran out of hearings.

02:10.088 --> 02:14.467
Air ICE is giving me a free flight
to my fucking funeral.

02:14.551 --> 02:16.511
Oh, Shani, I'm sorry.

02:16.594 --> 02:19.013
I'm still waiting on a copy
of my defense file.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.766
How the hell am I gonna get my case tossed

02:21.850 --> 02:24.352
if I can't prove my shitty lawyer
fucked up my conviction?

02:27.772 --> 02:29.983
How can I get
my immigration case dismissed

02:30.066 --> 02:34.320
if I can't prove that
my court-appointed attorney was negligent

02:34.404 --> 02:38.032
and affected the results
of my criminal proceedings?

02:38.116 --> 02:41.202
You got this.
Any decent judge would throw it out.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.538
"Decent" seems to be relative these days.

02:51.254 --> 02:53.840
Try to be nice
and you get shit on your head.

02:54.382 --> 02:55.884
God bless America.

02:59.470 --> 03:00.471
Isn't it great?

03:00.555 --> 03:02.557
It's a beauty, Ms. Ferguson.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.725
Thank you, Mr. Litvack.

03:03.808 --> 03:06.728
Like the inside of a cereal box
minus the happy prize.

03:07.312 --> 03:10.481
The happy prize is we don't have to keep
busing detainees across the state

03:10.565 --> 03:12.442
every time they have a court appearance.

03:12.525 --> 03:17.697
Exactly. And now every detainee from Essex
and Clinton counties get bused here.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.450
-Always looking out for the bottom line.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.202
Aw. Thank you.

03:22.285 --> 03:25.830
I will admit that when we first won
this contract, I was a bit daunted.

03:25.914 --> 03:29.250
These hearings can be...
very controversial.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.920
Plus the pressure
to build something so fast.

03:32.003 --> 03:34.923
But then Carlos here
told me a very inspiring story

03:35.006 --> 03:39.552
about how the DHS built an entire prison
in New Orleans the week after Katrina hit,

03:39.636 --> 03:42.847
and I thought, if they can build
an entire prison in the middle of a flood,

03:42.931 --> 03:45.475
I can build a courtroom
in the middle of a shitstorm.

03:45.558 --> 03:47.060
Standards to live by.

03:47.143 --> 03:50.480
I don't see judge's chambers anywhere.

03:50.563 --> 03:53.483
Are you planning on them
hanging out in the hall

03:53.566 --> 03:55.568
or does my office become a WeWork?

03:55.652 --> 03:57.403
Oh, the judges never leave the bench.

03:57.820 --> 03:59.405
Yeah, they see at least 100 cases a day.

03:59.822 --> 04:02.492
Maybe they wear those adult diapers
like that lady astronaut, right?

04:03.743 --> 04:07.455
Although, I am working on setting up
a teleconferencing line

04:07.538 --> 04:11.584
so the judges can do it all via webcam.
Speed us up by 32%.

04:11.668 --> 04:15.213
And some people complain
Skype sex feels impersonal.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.884
Linds... Ms. Ferguson,
why don't you sit in the judge's chair

04:19.968 --> 04:22.929
No.

04:23.012 --> 04:24.389
-Come on.
I can't.

04:24.472 --> 04:26.432
Yes, you can. Please.

04:28.935 --> 04:29.811
You.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.604
-All right.

04:36.609 --> 04:39.654
Ooh, so satisfying.
Carlos, you be the bailiff.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.865
-Do you mind taking our--
-Uh, no, I am out of here.

04:42.949 --> 04:46.452
Hey, sorry to bust in.
We got a minor situation in Medical.

04:49.747 --> 04:50.707
What happened to her?

04:50.790 --> 04:54.002
The patient presented with severe
abdominal upset and vaginal spotting.

04:54.085 --> 04:56.212
But, thankfully,
the pregnancy is still viable.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.297
She's pregnant?

04:58.506 --> 05:00.008
I'd say about nine weeks along.

05:00.341 --> 05:03.177
-She's scared, poor thing.

05:03.261 --> 05:05.555
She doesn't know that her little
oogie woogie's gonna be okay.

05:05.638 --> 05:10.476
Mama, mama, your baby's gonna be okay.
Okay, your baby's gonna be okay.

05:14.272 --> 05:15.606
Where is her translator?

05:15.690 --> 05:17.275
-We don't have a translator for that.

05:17.358 --> 05:21.863
You're supposed to file a report
if a detainee needs the Language Line.

05:21.946 --> 05:26.326
I have a new courtroom to oversee,
so this sounds like a you problem to me.

05:36.252 --> 05:39.213
I don't know why no one else
wants to work in the ICE kitchen.

05:39.297 --> 05:41.466
They scared they'll be deported
or something?

05:41.549 --> 05:43.468
Oh, it's 'cause Mendoza ain't easy.

05:43.551 --> 05:44.635
So, why you wanna do it?

05:44.719 --> 05:49.057
I'm trying to continue my journey
of personal improvement.

05:54.604 --> 05:58.149
Um, but you know what? Maybe I should
make amends with my bunkie first,

05:58.232 --> 06:00.109
because she's mad at me
'cause I made her clean up

06:00.193 --> 06:01.903
whatever was leaking out of the toilet
last night.

06:01.986 --> 06:03.905
Too late. We need kitchen crew.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.617
You only brought one person?

06:08.201 --> 06:10.995
Can't you see our entire
white contingent is MIA?

06:11.996 --> 06:15.500
Well, I always heard that one Latin
works just as hard as three whites.

06:15.583 --> 06:18.378
I know you mean that as a compliment,
but I'm gonna take it as an insult.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.921
I asked for Diaz, not Ruiz.

06:20.004 --> 06:21.839
Big Diaz and Little Diaz both declined.

06:21.923 --> 06:23.091
Wait, which one's which?

06:23.174 --> 06:25.343
It's a little confusing
because the older one is smaller.

06:25.426 --> 06:26.636
You're not getting a Diaz.

06:26.719 --> 06:28.429
Well, I don't want a Ruiz neither.

06:33.810 --> 06:37.772
Gloria, I know things have been
really rough between us.

06:37.855 --> 06:40.024
But I was hoping maybe...

06:40.566 --> 06:45.738
maybe this might be a chance for us to,
you know, reset the game.

06:46.322 --> 06:50.868
Relationships are best mended
by working together, you know?

06:52.495 --> 06:53.454
Fuck you.

06:59.627 --> 07:01.129
-Here's my check.
-Okay.

07:01.212 --> 07:04.382
And, um, I wanted to ask permission
to go to a fundraiser.

07:04.465 --> 07:06.843
My friend asked me to be her plus one.

07:06.926 --> 07:10.638
And there will be alcohol there,
of which I will not partake.

07:10.721 --> 07:12.723
And it will probably interfere
with my curfew,

07:12.807 --> 07:14.100
but it's for an important cause--

07:14.183 --> 07:17.270
I'm not interested in the details
of your date, but you can go.

07:17.353 --> 07:19.522
It's not a date,
but thank you very much for signing off.

07:19.605 --> 07:23.609
Thank yourself. I mean,
your employment situation has been steady,

07:23.693 --> 07:25.862
your drug tests have been
coming back clean,

07:25.945 --> 07:30.366
and looking at the clarity of your sample,
you're living a healthy life.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.201
Mmm.

07:32.285 --> 07:36.456
I am. I'm feeling great.
I even got back into running.

07:36.747 --> 07:39.500
I feel like I'm finally living my truth.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.170
Sorry, I know that's a cliché.

07:43.463 --> 07:48.134
-But clichés are clichés for a reason.
-Yes. Yes, they are.

07:48.217 --> 07:49.719
They're really just catchy truths.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.679
Do you know that squirrels' teeth
never stop growing?

07:51.762 --> 07:55.600
Okay, so your probation is ending soon,
and you might wanna try and figure out

07:55.683 --> 07:57.518
what you wanna do
with the rest of your life.

07:59.770 --> 08:00.980
Can you be more specific?

08:01.355 --> 08:03.858
Okay. "Have you found
a place of your own?"

08:04.650 --> 08:05.610
Not yet.

08:05.902 --> 08:07.737
-No. Okay.
-No.

08:08.237 --> 08:11.866
"Have you cut ties with people involved
with your past criminal activities?"

08:11.949 --> 08:14.702
Well, that one's tricky,
given the marriage.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.580
No. Okay.

08:17.663 --> 08:20.374
"Do you have career aspirations
beyond your current employment?"

08:20.666 --> 08:22.919
-Yes, of course.

08:23.002 --> 08:27.632
Well, I'm not sure exactly
what they are yet, beyond aspirational.

08:28.674 --> 08:29.675
No.

08:30.259 --> 08:31.219
Mmm-hmm.

08:33.137 --> 08:35.139
When do you need the answer
to these questions?

08:35.223 --> 08:36.390
Oh.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.228
They're

08:41.604 --> 08:44.398
You have to find
these answers for yourself.

08:51.531 --> 08:54.825
Go. And keep the door open
for the next one, please.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.202
-Thank you.
-Okay.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.246
Sophia!

08:58.329 --> 09:00.998
Girl, I haven't seen you
since the last time.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.876
-You look amazing.
And you look...

09:04.752 --> 09:08.631
like the last time, but damp.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.633
Ooh, um.

09:10.716 --> 09:12.510
Give the woman your card, Ms. Burset.

09:12.593 --> 09:15.763
She has some fancy party
and her hair needs an ambulance.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.101
Trust.

09:21.477 --> 09:24.689
All right, everybody out of your cells
and up against the wall, now!

09:27.900 --> 09:29.569
-Random sweep.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.362
What

09:31.862 --> 09:33.573
'Cause then it wouldn't be random.

09:35.032 --> 09:37.827
Move your ass, inmate. Move it.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.209
You got anything on you?

09:45.293 --> 09:48.254
Don't worry. Everything is buried
within the shower pipes.

09:48.337 --> 09:50.089
Except I got some buried in my cock pipe.

09:51.674 --> 09:52.883
I didn't do it.

09:52.967 --> 09:56.387
Went deep sea diving.
I caught me a hairy squid.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.889
Motherfucker.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.183
More like fuck your mother.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.031
This is a lot.

10:15.114 --> 10:19.243
Hm. I told you it was a good tip.
I mean, look at all these pills.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.954
Look at all that hair.
You could make yourself a toupee.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.414
Huh?

10:23.748 --> 10:26.500
Not "you," you. Just someone could.

10:27.335 --> 10:29.253
Now, how the heck
did somebody even sneak this in?

10:29.879 --> 10:31.631
Kind of looks
like a lobster claw.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.883
Which part's the tickle
and which part's the plug?

10:33.966 --> 10:36.218
Hopper, Ginger,
take all this to the contraband room

10:36.302 --> 10:39.555
and make sure it's itemized properly.

10:40.181 --> 10:42.350
Of course. And you're welcome.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.102
Hey.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.024
What do you know about this?

10:50.608 --> 10:54.904
Nothing. I... Nothing.
-Mmm-hmm.

10:54.987 --> 10:57.657
I really need to know
which one of these scrotum bros

10:57.740 --> 10:59.742
is bringing in all this stuff.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.662
I wish I could tell you, I do.
I just... I don't know.

11:03.287 --> 11:05.081
I could really use some help.

11:05.164 --> 11:08.709
Could you be my girl on the inside?
Tell me if you see anything?

11:09.001 --> 11:11.921
-Of course. I've got your back.
Right.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.941
Hey, Nicky. Thanks for coming.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.734
You got balls, I'll give you that.

11:34.318 --> 11:39.073
-Oh, you know, bright and sprightly.

11:39.156 --> 11:43.994
Look, I know Lorna is having a real
hard time with all this, and so am I.

11:44.537 --> 11:47.540
This is killing me. But I gotta move on.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.710
I was hoping maybe
you could help her understand

11:50.793 --> 11:53.170
why she's gotta sign these divorce papers.

11:53.254 --> 11:57.258
Oh, okay, so you asked me here
to help you with your divorce?

11:57.341 --> 12:00.553
Jesus, Vinnie. I can smell
the rotting carcass of your soul

12:00.636 --> 12:01.804
-through the glass.
-Nicky--

12:01.887 --> 12:04.557
You have a responsibility
to her as her kid's father,

12:04.640 --> 12:06.600
and you can't just suddenly decide
that you're moving

12:06.684 --> 12:07.768
and taking Sterling with you.

12:07.852 --> 12:10.354
He means everything to her.
She has a right to see him.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.648
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I don't know what Lorna told you, but...

12:17.528 --> 12:22.074
Actually, I know exactly what she told you
and that's the problem.

12:22.783 --> 12:28.038
Nicky, the baby died in the NICU.

12:30.499 --> 12:32.460
Eh, what do you mean?

12:32.543 --> 12:35.421
I-- I saw a picture of him yesterday
where he's drooling

12:35.504 --> 12:38.048
'cause he's teething,
'cause he's a very early teether.

12:38.132 --> 12:40.843
She's taking other people's photos
from the Internet.

12:41.886 --> 12:42.970
It's not him.

12:48.058 --> 12:49.268
Oh, shit.

12:50.352 --> 12:53.105
Oh, Vinnie, I'm so sorry.

12:57.318 --> 12:58.736
She's down the rabbit hole.

12:58.819 --> 13:00.446
'Cause she can't process it.

13:01.030 --> 13:04.700
She's gone someplace in her head,
and I can't reach her.

13:05.701 --> 13:09.205
The prison doc said that they're gonna
transfer her to some unit

13:09.288 --> 13:11.540
with all the oldies and nutties,

13:11.624 --> 13:14.210
and maybe that's gonna help.
At least she'll have more supervision. What
She doesn't know anyone in Florida.

13:17.254 --> 13:20.007
She shouldn't be in there.
She should be with me.

13:20.090 --> 13:24.011
Nicky, I know that you love her,
and I appreciate all you do for her, I do.

13:24.094 --> 13:25.429
So, don't take this the wrong way,

13:25.513 --> 13:30.142
but you've been with her this entire time
and you didn't know.

13:31.602 --> 13:34.104
She needs more help
than you or me can give her.

13:34.188 --> 13:38.651
I've been distracted, yeah,
but, uh, I'm here now.

13:38.734 --> 13:42.655
And I understand, all right?
You need to move on.

13:42.738 --> 13:46.283
But I can't let her go
when she needs me most.

13:47.034 --> 13:50.955
You need to tell them not to transfer her.

13:51.038 --> 13:55.000
It's not up to me.
And I think it's already a done deal.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.171
I'm sorry.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.889
My moms used to make us
fish head soup before tests.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.683
Said their brain cells make us smarter.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.184
Fish brains? Come on.

14:12.268 --> 14:15.187
When's the last time you thought
to yourself, "Wow, there's a smart fish"?

14:15.646 --> 14:16.647
<i>Finding Nemo?</i>

14:17.231 --> 14:18.482
Yo, Taystee, you done yet?

14:18.566 --> 14:22.486
Damn, you acting like you waiting on
some chili cheese fries.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.239
Except for chili cheese fries
can't tell you if you're dumb.

14:25.322 --> 14:26.240
What do you mean, I failed?

14:26.949 --> 14:28.784
All right, B-plus!

14:29.118 --> 14:32.621
If I can get Luschek to bring in
some fish head, I know I can ace this.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.833
If I can give Luschek some head head,
I know I can ace it, too.

14:36.250 --> 14:38.377
You realize it's a machine
that grades the tests?

14:38.460 --> 14:41.672
I know that. I just think his sperm cells
will make me smarter.

14:42.214 --> 14:44.884
Congrats, Doggett. You did good.

14:45.467 --> 14:46.385
Wait, she passed?

14:46.969 --> 14:48.387
Give back my test.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.473
You still got a bunch wrong,
even with your extra dummy time.

14:51.765 --> 14:54.727
-I'm not a dummy.

14:54.810 --> 14:57.354
Now let's go over some of the basic
algebra you messed up on.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.940
My brain's gonna explode.
No one uses this shit anyhow.

15:00.024 --> 15:02.401
Are you kidding me?
You need this shit to live.

15:02.484 --> 15:04.278
-Two years.

15:04.361 --> 15:08.240
Okay, so let's come up with a budget
for when that day happens.

15:08.699 --> 15:12.786
Let's say that you get a job
the first week you get out,

15:12.870 --> 15:15.205
because you baller, right?

15:16.332 --> 15:22.296
But money also has to go out
for probation fees,

15:22.379 --> 15:26.467
water, power, Internet, and you gotta eat.

15:26.550 --> 15:28.510
-My kid's gotta eat, too.
She got a mouth to feed.
Hmm.

15:30.638 --> 15:33.057
And then, there is X.

15:33.140 --> 15:36.602
X is the amount
that you have left for rent.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.771
X better be enough for a two bedroom.

15:38.854 --> 15:40.856
I must've done it wrong
'cause I have negative 300.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.316
I got the same thing.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.738
That's because that's what it is.

15:48.697 --> 15:50.115
I got positive 500.

15:50.199 --> 15:52.409
But that's cause I'm trappin'
to supplement my income.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.787
Man, math is bullshit.

15:54.870 --> 15:55.871
Maybe you could get a loan.

15:55.955 --> 15:58.666
Ain't no bank gonna give a loan
to an ex-con.

15:58.749 --> 16:01.794
Get a community loan, like my mama did
when our trailer was towed away.

16:01.877 --> 16:04.421
Everyone pitched in and helped us pay.

16:04.505 --> 16:08.133
They did? That's good.
That's what loans should be.

16:08.217 --> 16:10.886
Except that ain't a loan.
That's a redneck Kickstarter.

16:10.970 --> 16:13.138
No, it is too a loan,
because Mama repaid it

16:13.222 --> 16:14.890
when John John's trailer burned down.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.476
I mean, she might've sucked him off,
I can't really remember,

16:17.559 --> 16:18.852
but either way, it was paid.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.236
Tell her the big slot
is for the pasta casserole.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.529
The big slot is for--

16:28.612 --> 16:32.074
I can hear you fine, Gloria,
and whenever you're ready to talk to me--

16:32.324 --> 16:34.034
You're running half an hour
behind, Mendoza.

16:34.118 --> 16:35.285
Third time this week.

16:35.369 --> 16:38.038
I'm doing what I can
when you don't bring me any volunteers.

16:47.214 --> 16:48.465
Where is everybody?

16:48.549 --> 16:50.592
Nowhere good is my guess.

17:00.185 --> 17:03.313
Well, well, so much for Saint Gloria, huh?

17:03.397 --> 17:05.774
She dealing Aleida's shit,
or is that Daya's shit?

17:05.858 --> 17:10.696
That ain't got nothing to do
with either of the Diazeses.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.784
Please, I need to talk to Nicky.
Where is she?

17:15.868 --> 17:19.413
No clue. I mean, I seen her in prison,

17:19.496 --> 17:22.291
so I know that she ain't escaped
or been released or nothing.

17:22.541 --> 17:25.044
Hey, Shani, Nicky wanted to be here,

17:25.127 --> 17:27.212
but some people close to her
are kind of falling apart.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.173
She's dealing with a lot of heavy shit
right now.

17:29.256 --> 17:33.093
There's heavy shit here, too.
When is she here? I need to talk to her.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.054
I don't know.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.685
Where is everyone

17:41.769 --> 17:44.563
She's going over her case.
Everyone's hearings are being pushed up.

17:44.646 --> 17:46.815
Shit. Were you able to talk to your boys?

17:46.899 --> 17:49.234
The foster home won't accept calls
from the detention center,

17:49.318 --> 17:52.613
which is why I have to ask
for another favor.

17:52.988 --> 17:55.115
Is there any way
you could bring your phone in?

17:56.658 --> 17:58.911
-No, I can't do that.

17:58.994 --> 18:01.622
-Please, you don't understand.
-I'm getting out in a few weeks.

18:01.705 --> 18:02.915
Please, I'm begging you.

18:04.958 --> 18:08.337
I got my own kids to think of. I'm sorry.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.221
Mrs. Córdova,
I'm so sorry they called you in,

18:17.304 --> 18:19.973
but Abel hasn't stopped crying
since this morning.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.810
We got Benji out of class,
but he couldn't calm him either.

18:22.893 --> 18:25.437
In the nurse's office.

18:25.771 --> 18:29.066
Mrs. Córdova,
I'm really sorry for your loss.

18:36.990 --> 18:37.825
Hey.

18:37.908 --> 18:39.827
He was scared
that you wouldn't come back.

18:40.619 --> 18:44.957
Sweetheart, Mommy always comes back
at three o'clock, like every day.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.709
Is this about Daddy?

18:49.211 --> 18:50.170
Come on.

18:52.589 --> 18:55.175
I know you miss him so much.

18:56.009 --> 18:59.888
And we'll be missing him for a long time,
but we are here together.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.682
What if you die, too?

19:02.141 --> 19:04.351
Oh, baby, I'm not going to die.

19:04.434 --> 19:07.771
Fat Enzo says everybody dies, even babies.

19:07.855 --> 19:12.401
Don't listen to Fat Enzo,
or Skinny Enzo, or any Enzo.

19:13.277 --> 19:17.698
I can't die. I have to stick around,
make sure you two get into college.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.950
And then I have to make sure
you study hard,

19:20.033 --> 19:23.120
and treat women right
and marry someone you love,

19:23.203 --> 19:28.584
and get good jobs, and have kids
that you make me babysit every Saturday,

19:29.209 --> 19:32.546
and then, maybe, once you're 70,

19:32.629 --> 19:35.382
and need your diapers changed again,
then I'll die.

19:36.675 --> 19:42.431
Oh, hey, hey, hey, I'll be 100 by then.
It won't matter.

19:43.015 --> 19:47.769
And I'll still come back and haunt you
every day, so you better stay good.

19:49.688 --> 19:52.608
Come on.
How about we go get some raspados?

19:52.691 --> 19:53.692
And then TV?

19:54.568 --> 19:57.905
Okay, but you have to promise me

19:57.988 --> 20:01.783
that tomorrow we'll all do our best
to get back to our lives again.

20:02.701 --> 20:03.702
Hmm

20:07.664 --> 20:08.874
Okay.

20:10.334 --> 20:12.377
I'm so glad you're dressing up again.

20:12.794 --> 20:17.633
I was afraid you were turning into
one of those butch lesbians.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.469
-Mom.
Sorry, sorry. Bisexuals.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.804
I don't even know
how you do that, actually.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.432
Both genders? It sounds exhausting.

20:25.515 --> 20:29.895
I already worry when your father
is spending time with a woman.

20:30.437 --> 20:34.691
I think I'd go crazy if I had to worry
every time he went out with a man, too.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.944
Alex knows that she doesn't have to worry.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.028
Ah.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.364
So, what do you think?

20:41.573 --> 20:44.493
It's nice. Not quite me, though.

20:44.576 --> 20:46.662
But it's from Bergdorf's.

20:47.746 --> 20:49.957
-Vintage.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.794
I remember you had some very cool dresses
way back when, right?

20:53.877 --> 20:54.711
I do.

20:58.090 --> 20:58.924
Hey, babe.

20:59.424 --> 21:01.551
<i>I got something in the mail today.</i>

21:01.635 --> 21:04.012
Ooh, great. Have you opened it?

21:04.096 --> 21:06.974
A very considerate CO
already did the hard part for me.

21:07.057 --> 21:08.100
Ah.

21:08.183 --> 21:10.560
<i> Kind of.</i>

21:10.644 --> 21:12.104
Minus the cookie.

21:12.187 --> 21:16.525
"Because the fuzz on your stomach
feels like suede against my cheek."

21:17.150 --> 21:21.280
"Because you taught me that coconut oil
makes delicious edible lube."

21:21.363 --> 21:24.157
What are these?
<i> Reasons I love you. </i>

21:24.449 --> 21:26.201
And they're
not all sex-related.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.870
You just happened to pick
two of the pornier ones.

21:28.954 --> 21:32.165
<i>But you can't read 'em all.</i>
<i>You gotta save 'em.</i>

21:32.249 --> 21:35.085
One for every week you got left.

21:35.168 --> 21:37.087
Sentences to get me through my sentence?

21:37.170 --> 21:39.631
I know it's cheesy, but...

21:39.715 --> 21:44.303
No, it's not.
I love it, Pipes. Thank you.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.765
I know that the last few weeks
have been kind of shitty,

21:48.849 --> 21:50.809
and it's been hard for us to talk.

21:51.393 --> 21:56.565
But I wanted you to know that
even if there is a day you can't call,

21:56.648 --> 22:02.821
or a week I can't visit,
I am always thinking about you, Alex.

22:03.905 --> 22:04.906
Me, too.

22:05.949 --> 22:06.783
<i>Ta-da!</i>

22:07.367 --> 22:09.578
-Vintage!
Wow!

22:15.417 --> 22:16.293
All right.

22:16.376 --> 22:17.544
What is going on over there?

22:17.627 --> 22:20.964
This Cinderella has a ball to attend.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.008
<i>If she can find a dress in time.</i>

22:23.091 --> 22:24.843
Are you working one of those
character birthdays?

22:24.926 --> 22:27.888
-Yeah.

22:27.971 --> 22:31.600
<i>This is a real ball.</i>
<i>Except maybe not the Cinderella kind,</i>

22:31.683 --> 22:34.895
because really, that was just
a glorified episode of <i>The Bachelor.</i>

22:34.978 --> 22:36.813
What kind of a ball
are you talking about

22:36.897 --> 22:38.273
<i>The fundraising kind.</i>

22:38.357 --> 22:41.860
I'm going as a tourist. Zelda snuck me in.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.533
Oh.

22:48.784 --> 22:49.659
That sounds fun.

22:49.743 --> 22:50.786
Mmm-hmm.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.999
I hope your fairy godmother
comes through with that dress.

22:56.083 --> 22:57.959
Mmm, you and me both.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.713
Hmm.

23:02.255 --> 23:04.424
Both genders will love it.

23:04.508 --> 23:06.385
<i>An inmate from Litchfield Federal Prison</i>

23:06.468 --> 23:07.511
<i>is attempting to contact you.</i>

23:07.594 --> 23:09.471
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Hello?</i>

23:10.472 --> 23:12.641
Don't tell me I'm waking your ass up.

23:12.724 --> 23:16.019
Oh.
Hey, Taystee. No, no, I'm up.

23:16.103 --> 23:17.729
<i>I looked for you yesterday,</i>
<i>and they said</i> <i>you weren't teaching no more. </i>

23:19.731 --> 23:21.983
Yo, if you sick,
we appreciate you staying away,

23:22.067 --> 23:24.903
because you know how fast
everything spread around here.

23:24.986 --> 23:28.281
I mean, this place is like preschool,
but with crabs.

23:28.365 --> 23:31.284
No, Taystee, I'm not-- I'm not sick.
It's just, uh...

23:32.828 --> 23:35.455
It's a long story.
Is there something I can help you with?

23:35.539 --> 23:38.542
Actually, there is.

23:38.625 --> 23:41.670
<i>-No, no, no. It's, um...</i>

23:41.753 --> 23:46.716
I got this idea,
and I know it sounds crazy, but...

23:47.759 --> 23:49.636
-I'm listening.
<i>-I've been doing some reading</i>

23:49.719 --> 23:52.431
about what happens to women
when they first get out of prison.

23:52.514 --> 23:57.644
And basically, if they don't get some kind
of assist within the first 72 hours,

23:58.395 --> 24:02.023
they probably gonna end up criming
and landing they asses back in here,

24:02.107 --> 24:03.108
like I did.

24:03.191 --> 24:05.277
So, I was thinking...

24:05.902 --> 24:09.448
What if there was some kind of
loans program special for them

24:09.531 --> 24:11.366
<i>to help them get back</i>
<i>on they feet, right? </i> <i>They could repay it when they can,</i>

24:13.368 --> 24:16.246
and then that money
can go to the next person.

24:16.329 --> 24:20.709
So-- So, like, um, microloans
for newly released inmates?

24:21.042 --> 24:21.960
They exist?

24:22.043 --> 24:23.545
I don't think so, but they should.

24:25.547 --> 24:28.300
Is it stupid if I ask you
to help me start it up?

24:28.383 --> 24:31.052
<i>No. No, it's not stupid. </i>

24:31.761 --> 24:35.557
Taystee, it's a fantastic idea,
but now is not a good time for me

24:36.725 --> 24:39.478
to get involved in anything
that might, uh...

24:44.065 --> 24:47.360
I'll tell you what.
Why don't you put together a proposal,

24:47.444 --> 24:49.529
and I might not be able
to do anything for you,

24:49.613 --> 24:51.323
but I know some people I can call.

24:52.199 --> 24:54.743
Yo! That's what I'm talking about.

24:54.826 --> 24:57.329
All right. So, first, if we just--

24:57.412 --> 24:59.623
<i></i>

24:59.915 --> 25:01.416
It's real good to have you back.

25:05.045 --> 25:08.632
For years, my government
has persecuted people like me.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.300
Like you, or you specifically?

25:10.383 --> 25:12.469
No way this bitch
is gonna throw my case out.

25:12.552 --> 25:15.430
Based on lack of evidence, I'm denying
your application for political asylum...

25:15.514 --> 25:18.183
I hope she breaks for lunch
before we're called.

25:18.266 --> 25:20.727
Conviction rates drop by 30% after lunch.

25:20.810 --> 25:24.105
Next case, 519, Córdova, Karla.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.615
State your true and complete name.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.368
Karla Diana Adilene Córdova.

25:36.451 --> 25:37.327
At your last proceeding,

25:37.410 --> 25:40.121
your case was set over to give you time
to find an attorney.

25:40.205 --> 25:41.957
Yet you're here today without an attorney.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.125
I'm representing myself, Your Honor.

25:44.209 --> 25:48.672
I'd like to file my application for relief
under the Convention Against Torture Act.

25:48.755 --> 25:52.259
Do you have a filled out I-589 application

25:52.342 --> 25:54.678
and your supporting evidence
that demonstrates

25:54.761 --> 25:57.055
you will be tortured
if returned to El Salvador today?

25:57.138 --> 25:58.348
I do, Your Honor.

26:02.435 --> 26:07.065
Uh, the newspaper article is about the
school where I used to teach, El Aleph.

26:07.148 --> 26:10.277
The year I left, we had 36 deaths.

26:10.360 --> 26:13.405
All of them boys
who refused to join gangs.

26:13.488 --> 26:16.783
I knew them all personally.
Many of them were my students.

26:16.866 --> 26:19.077
They were good boys,
but they had no way out.

26:19.160 --> 26:22.330
When I became pregnant,
my husband and I knew we had to leave.

26:22.998 --> 26:24.374
We couldn't risk our child's life--

26:24.457 --> 26:28.837
Gang violence is not grounds for CAT.
It's not even grounds for asylum.

26:28.920 --> 26:31.172
-I'm getting to that.
-Speed it up, Ms. Córdova.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.383
I have two boys now. American boys.

26:34.009 --> 26:39.472
I can't take them to a country
where their choices are kill or be killed.

26:39.556 --> 26:45.103
The Convention Against Torture clearly
states that torture is intense suffering

26:45.186 --> 26:49.983
that is inflicted in order
to obtain information or to coerce.

26:51.109 --> 26:54.779
If I take my boys back,
they'll be coerced into joining the gangs,

26:54.863 --> 27:00.285
or they will suffer the consequences,
the very definition by which CAT stands.

27:00.368 --> 27:03.330
The state is not deporting
Ms. Córdova's kids.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.290
The state is deporting Ms. Córdova.

27:05.373 --> 27:06.374
I'm not leaving them.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.210
Their father passed away last year.
I'm all they have.

27:09.294 --> 27:12.047
Your Honor, Ms. Córdova
doesn't even have custody of her children.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.381
That's only because I'm in here.

27:13.465 --> 27:17.177
I'm seeing your children are already
placed in pre-adoptive foster care.

27:17.260 --> 27:20.096
I'm their mother.
I will file to get them back.

27:20.180 --> 27:22.807
Ms. Córdova,
your children will be safer here.

27:22.891 --> 27:24.893
If anyone's made that case, it's you.

27:24.976 --> 27:28.521
Unfortunately, what you've failed to do
is make a case for yourself.

27:28.605 --> 27:31.524
This application doesn't even make
a prima facie case

27:31.608 --> 27:33.234
for relief under the CAT.

27:33.318 --> 27:38.323
I'm denying your case and I am issuing
a written order of removal.

27:38.406 --> 27:39.532
You can't!

27:41.660 --> 27:43.912
No.

27:45.914 --> 27:46.748
No.

27:53.588 --> 27:55.423
I'm so glad that you're doing
what you love.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.218
You should be,
'cause I'm about to fix your situation.

27:58.301 --> 28:01.763
So, let's start with
what kind of event are you going to?

28:02.389 --> 28:04.182
The kind where
they'll pay the price of a Lexus

28:04.265 --> 28:06.935
for a painting the size of a place mat.

28:07.018 --> 28:08.061
Oh.

28:08.144 --> 28:09.979
Somebody landed on their Louboutins.

28:10.063 --> 28:12.399
Thank you.
No, I'm only going as a plus one.

28:12.982 --> 28:15.026
-Mmm-hmm.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.194
Good for you.

28:17.153 --> 28:21.074
You know, some fools find it hard
to let go of their prison relationships.

28:21.157 --> 28:24.703
Oh, no, not that kind of plus one.
Alex and I are still together.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.287
We even got married.

28:26.371 --> 28:29.124
Prison married, not married married,
but it's the same thing.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.751
We'll do something more official
when she's out in a few years.

28:33.211 --> 28:36.214
You know a few years
is a lot of days and nights, right?

28:36.881 --> 28:40.343
Well, not so much when you consider
the fact that marriage is forever.

28:41.511 --> 28:43.596
Sweetie, I know
not even you're that naive.

28:43.680 --> 28:44.889
It's hard.

28:46.558 --> 28:47.976
It's hard, but we're trying.

28:49.561 --> 28:51.312
You know you don't have to
keep trying, right?

28:52.564 --> 28:54.566
We're not in prison anymore.

28:54.649 --> 28:58.027
We can do whatever we want,
be whatever we want.

28:59.904 --> 29:02.991
Yeah, but you can't pretend
that prison just didn't happen.

29:03.074 --> 29:06.745
No, but I'm not gonna spend the rest
of my life looking back on it either.

29:07.537 --> 29:08.872
I did my time.

29:09.539 --> 29:15.003
I'm looking forward now.
And you and your hair should do the same.

29:15.920 --> 29:18.923
So, which one of these Beckys
do you wanna be?

29:24.220 --> 29:28.767
Hey. Sorry I couldn't make it yesterday.
It was crazy out there.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.560
You should've seen
how many chargers we seized.

29:30.643 --> 29:32.061
We need to stop.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.316
I totally agree,
or at least lay low for a while.

29:36.399 --> 29:38.735
No, I mean all of it.

29:40.320 --> 29:41.237
You mean us?

29:41.905 --> 29:43.364
We are not an "us."

29:43.448 --> 29:46.618
Wait, what about what you said
in the shower?

29:46.701 --> 29:49.120
I'm sorry that I made you feel
like this was something it's not.

29:49.454 --> 29:50.580
You know this is real.

29:50.663 --> 29:54.292
Maybe it could be if things
were different, but I'm married.

29:54.375 --> 29:57.629
To someone who can't be with you.
What kind of marriage is that?

29:57.712 --> 29:59.506
I don't know,
but it's the marriage I'm in.

30:00.632 --> 30:03.802
And what we're doing,
it's not fair to Piper or to you.

30:03.885 --> 30:06.262
-Bullshit!
-Okay, keep your voice down.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.974
You don't have to do this.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.478
I'm sorry.

30:37.126 --> 30:40.922
582, time to go.
Transpo is waiting outside.

30:41.005 --> 30:43.925
Strip your bed, grab your belongings
and bring them with you to the front.

30:44.008 --> 30:45.677
Is the kitchen crew here yet?

30:45.760 --> 30:47.554
They'll have food for you on the plane.

30:48.179 --> 30:49.305
Okay. Coming.

30:58.523 --> 31:00.483
-Hey!

31:00.567 --> 31:01.943
582, stop that!

31:04.654 --> 31:05.697
What are you doing?

31:07.490 --> 31:08.575
-Oh, my God! Stop!
-You're hurting her!

31:08.908 --> 31:11.786
Back off! Everybody, shut the fuck up!

31:12.996 --> 31:13.830
Let go of me.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.290
-And you, settle down!
-Stop!

31:15.373 --> 31:17.166
-Let's go.
-Get over here! Come on!

31:17.250 --> 31:18.585
You can't send me back there!

31:18.668 --> 31:20.044
-Get back to work.
-Shani, calm down.

31:21.838 --> 31:24.382
You can't take me back there!

31:25.758 --> 31:26.718
Shani.

31:27.760 --> 31:28.970
Get in here.

31:31.806 --> 31:33.224
What is this one doing here?

31:33.725 --> 31:36.686
Your cousin says he saw you
in that hotel bar the tourists go to.

31:37.562 --> 31:38.980
It's a miracle they even let him in.

31:39.063 --> 31:40.148
Shani!

31:40.857 --> 31:42.025
I'm joking.

31:42.108 --> 31:44.944
I was out with my girlfriends
and didn't talk to anyone.

31:45.028 --> 31:46.905
And it's not even eleven yet.

31:46.988 --> 31:49.365
He says you were kissing a woman.

31:49.449 --> 31:52.702
It's the girl whose father runs
that private school in Al Bairat.

31:52.785 --> 31:54.162
No, no. This is not true.

31:54.245 --> 31:56.873
How could you use your computer
for such things, Shani?

31:56.956 --> 31:59.208
All these pictures are with this girl.

32:03.713 --> 32:07.008
You wrote those things, for all to see?

32:09.928 --> 32:11.095
Daddy, I'm sorry.

32:20.647 --> 32:25.193
You know that I could never hurt you.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.031
But I can't say the same
for the rest of the family.

32:34.744 --> 32:36.537
You mean, you'll let them kill me?

32:36.621 --> 32:39.958
You tarnished your family's name
and our reputation.

32:51.761 --> 32:55.473
The court hereby designates China
as the country of removal.

32:56.099 --> 33:00.895
813, Flores, Bianca. Blanca.

33:01.187 --> 33:02.021
You were right.

33:02.397 --> 33:05.191
This judge won't dismiss your case.
You need to change your strategy.

33:05.274 --> 33:08.069
You crazy? I can't change strategies now.

33:08.152 --> 33:09.946
Tell her you want a stay of removal

33:10.029 --> 33:12.657
to fight your original conviction
in criminal court.

33:12.740 --> 33:14.867
813.
-It'll buy you some time.

33:19.998 --> 33:23.167
To the respondent,
state your true and complete name.

33:23.251 --> 33:24.460
Blanca Raiza Flores.

33:24.544 --> 33:26.754
And you're a citizen
of the Dominican Republic? Yes, Your Honor, but I would
like to request to stay, please.

33:30.299 --> 33:33.720
Yes, everyone would like to stay.
I think that's why we're all here.

33:33.803 --> 33:36.889
I meant I would like to request
a stay of removal.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.307
You want a continuance?

33:40.268 --> 33:43.730
Yes, Your Honor, to fight
my previous conviction in criminal court.

33:43.813 --> 33:46.190
The state has not been presented
with any new evidence

33:46.274 --> 33:49.193
that would lead us to believe that
she could appeal her original conviction.

33:49.277 --> 33:51.571
Your Honor, I was advised to plead guilty

33:51.654 --> 33:54.741
to helping organize a riot
in exchange for no additional time.

33:55.533 --> 33:59.078
My attorney never informed me
that my immigration status

33:59.162 --> 34:01.456
would be affected
or my green card revoked.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.709
This amounts to ineffective assistance
of counsel.

34:04.792 --> 34:07.795
Had I been informed of the consequences,

34:08.379 --> 34:12.508
I would've assumed my risk
and fought my case in court.

34:13.426 --> 34:16.763
I'm asking for the opportunity
to do so now.

34:17.847 --> 34:21.142
Your Honor,
I would like to go to criminal court

34:21.225 --> 34:23.561
and get my original conviction
turned over.

34:23.644 --> 34:25.813
-Exactly.

34:32.695 --> 34:34.238
<i>Along the border, East Berliners </i>

34:34.322 --> 34:36.157
<i>are forced to evacuate their homes,</i>

34:36.240 --> 34:38.367
<i>as the Communist police move to prevent...</i>

34:45.875 --> 34:47.668
Fuck!

34:49.796 --> 34:52.507
What the... Where'd my class go?

34:52.590 --> 34:57.178
Well, guess they weren't very interested
in current events in East Germany.

34:58.888 --> 35:00.389
But you are?

35:00.473 --> 35:01.682
All right.

35:04.685 --> 35:05.978
-I need a favor.
-Sorry.

35:07.605 --> 35:08.606
I'm stretched to capacity.

35:08.689 --> 35:10.483
My shit pipe
won't give another millimeter.

35:10.566 --> 35:13.319
Oh, God, no. All right, look, I...

35:15.154 --> 35:17.698
I want you to stop Lorna's transfer
to Florida, all right?

35:17.782 --> 35:20.284
I need you to transfer me
to her cell instead,

35:20.368 --> 35:22.203
or her into mine.

35:23.329 --> 35:24.872
-Yeah.

35:24.956 --> 35:27.750
No. Transfers are way too much paperwork.

35:27.834 --> 35:31.087
She's lucky she's not getting sent
to a prison that still has a psych ward.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.630
You know they found her
trying to nurse a chicken?

35:32.713 --> 35:36.134
Yeah, I mean, she needs someone
to take care of her.

35:36.217 --> 35:37.885
And your magic fingers are the cure, huh?

35:38.177 --> 35:40.346
You know, I don't even know
why I'm asking you.

35:40.429 --> 35:43.391
I guess it was on the off chance
that maybe you'd grown a spine

35:43.474 --> 35:46.394
or some decency
since you last fucked me over.

35:46.477 --> 35:48.479
Well, I guess that's a negative on both.

35:50.857 --> 35:54.694
Look, man, I fucked up, all right?

35:54.777 --> 35:56.445
I let down my family.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.198
And it's too late with Red,

35:59.991 --> 36:04.370
but maybe I still have
a chance with Lorna, all right

36:05.746 --> 36:06.956
So, please.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.001
Okay, fine. Fine.

36:11.294 --> 36:12.461
Fine. Just...

36:13.588 --> 36:15.006
Stop with the...

36:15.840 --> 36:19.051
Jesus Christ. It's like watching
a hot girl take a shit.

36:19.135 --> 36:21.929
I mean, you know they do it,
but, you know, you never...

36:22.555 --> 36:24.182
You never wanna see it.

36:28.060 --> 36:28.936
Customers only.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.981
I will customize that ferret nose
straight into that skull.

36:36.861 --> 36:38.821
Sorry. Desperate times.

36:40.948 --> 36:43.534
Speaking of desperate,
I hope you're not looking to buy,

36:43.618 --> 36:45.995
'cause I sure as shit
ain't selling to you.

36:46.078 --> 36:49.498
It's amazing how they didn't find
any of your shit in the drug bust.

36:53.711 --> 36:56.589
I guess I live under a lucky star.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.675
Maybe it's your chance to get clean.

36:59.759 --> 37:02.762
Maybe I should be more like you, huh?

37:02.845 --> 37:06.349
Can't make your own deals,
so you go chasing after bald dicks

37:06.432 --> 37:08.351
and licking their balls
'cause they got you on a leash?

37:09.143 --> 37:13.314
I'm alpha now, bitch.
You and Hopper better step the fuck back.

37:13.397 --> 37:16.651
You think I like slinging this shit,
you fucking idiot?

37:16.901 --> 37:19.820
Everything I do is so my kids could eat,
have a roof over their head,

37:20.071 --> 37:23.532
so you don't die of a fuckin' overdose
like every fucking junkie ever.

37:23.616 --> 37:27.828
The only thing you've ever done
is make us feel worthless, all right?

37:28.120 --> 37:29.747
That's why we fuckin' hate your ass.

37:29.830 --> 37:31.374
At least I stick around.

37:31.457 --> 37:35.211
Even while I'm in here, I make sure
that my kids know they still got a mother.

37:36.504 --> 37:37.838
Not like you, just...

37:38.297 --> 37:39.840
Not like me what, huh?

37:40.758 --> 37:42.009
What? Say it.

37:42.093 --> 37:44.971
Not like you, giving away your baby
like she's a fucking gerbil

37:45.054 --> 37:46.681
you got tired of playing with.

37:54.897 --> 37:56.274
Fuck you, Aleida.

38:16.335 --> 38:18.671
Oh, don't tell me
we got the language wrong again.

38:22.758 --> 38:24.468
No, it's K'iche'. Oh, thank God. Okay. Uh...

38:26.345 --> 38:29.890
Please, tell Ms. Chaj her baby is fine.

38:44.155 --> 38:45.865
Wh

38:45.948 --> 38:47.742
She says she doesn't want it.

38:56.125 --> 38:57.960
We're going to die in here.  Let us out!

39:00.629 --> 39:01.964
Bite it. So you don't faint.

39:13.517 --> 39:14.685
We're here?

39:14.769 --> 39:17.188
Everybody, shut up!
Could be the cops.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.401
What's up?

39:22.735 --> 39:26.822
Don't you want some sun?
Vitamin D. It'll do you good.

39:28.616 --> 39:29.658
Get out!

39:34.163 --> 39:38.292
Welcome to the home stretch.
From here you can walk to the river.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.127
Very exciting, no?

39:40.211 --> 39:42.421
Whoa, slow down.

39:42.505 --> 39:43.881
Nobody walks for free.

39:43.964 --> 39:45.966
You should learn this now
before you get to the States.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.259
Everything costs.

39:47.343 --> 39:49.887
We already paid. Ask him!

39:49.970 --> 39:53.140
If you want to pass by our territory,
tolls are extra.

39:59.063 --> 40:00.147
We have no more money.

40:00.231 --> 40:03.275
Then call your family in the States
and have them transfer it to my account.

40:03.359 --> 40:04.193
You need a phone?

40:04.276 --> 40:05.778
I'll add the call fee to your total.

40:05.861 --> 40:08.239
We don't have family there.

40:17.915 --> 40:19.792
We also take
other forms of payment.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.257
Hey.

40:27.383 --> 40:29.969
I need you to sign off
on a transpo to the women's clinic.

40:30.052 --> 40:31.345
Another yeast outbreak?

40:31.429 --> 40:33.264
These women really need
to lay off the sugar.

40:33.347 --> 40:34.557
It's for Chaj.

40:35.141 --> 40:36.934
The doctor said she and the baby are fine.

40:37.268 --> 40:39.562
First of all, it's not a baby.
It's a fetus.

40:39.645 --> 40:42.523
She was trying to induce a miscarriage.

40:42.606 --> 40:46.652
Jesus Christ, is there no respect
for human life around here?

40:46.735 --> 40:48.195
The only transportation I got for her

40:48.279 --> 40:50.489
is the one that takes her back
to where she came from.

40:52.199 --> 40:55.453
This woman was raped
while trying to come into this country.

40:55.536 --> 40:57.955
I don't try to change your policies,
Ms. Figueroa.

40:58.038 --> 40:59.165
Don't try to change mine.

40:59.748 --> 41:02.585
It's not a matter of policy.
It's a matter of law.

41:02.918 --> 41:05.921
Then maybe it's time you realize
we go by different laws around here.

41:08.090 --> 41:11.093
Can someone please take the baby outside
until it's her turn?

41:13.971 --> 41:15.598
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

41:15.681 --> 41:17.516
My name is Judge Christine Holister,

41:17.600 --> 41:21.020
and we're sitting in the immigration court
in Litchfield, New York.

41:21.103 --> 41:24.982
These are removal proceedings for siblings
Alma and Santiago Casías.

41:25.065 --> 41:27.818
Let the record show
the respondents are present in court,

41:27.902 --> 41:29.028
but without an attorney.

41:29.111 --> 41:32.198
Do you understand
what these proceedings are about?

41:33.032 --> 41:35.743
Miss Casías, do you and your brother
have a lawyer?

41:37.912 --> 41:40.289
-No.

41:41.832 --> 41:45.127
Well, do you understand
that we are here to determine

41:45.211 --> 41:48.214
whether or not you two can remain
in the United States?

41:48.297 --> 41:50.132
Can I use the bathroom?

41:50.591 --> 41:54.011
I thought this courtroom
was for adult hearings.

41:54.094 --> 41:56.180
We have the juvenile docket on Fridays.

41:56.889 --> 41:59.016
Illegal's an illegal,
even if they're mini.

41:59.642 --> 42:03.395
And a piece of shit is a piece of shit,
even if he's grown.

42:03.479 --> 42:04.897
She said "shit."

42:06.357 --> 42:07.191
Hey!

42:10.236 --> 42:11.237
Whoa.

42:11.987 --> 42:14.698
So, love letters?
That's the big fuckin' secret?

42:14.782 --> 42:16.700
-Tell Ruiz to shut the fuck up.
-Oh, my God.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.869
Both of you shut the fuck up.

42:18.953 --> 42:22.456
Jesus. What the hell happened
between you two, anyways?

42:22.540 --> 42:24.333
What happened is she's a cunt.

42:27.086 --> 42:30.047
Gloria, I know that I fucked up,

42:30.130 --> 42:32.800
and I accept full responsibility
for my actions.

42:33.759 --> 42:36.220
I know forgiveness
is going to take a long time...

42:39.390 --> 42:41.016
or it might not even never come.

42:41.350 --> 42:44.728
But I hope that one day
we can at least have a civil conversation.

42:44.812 --> 42:45.938
-So...

42:46.939 --> 42:48.983
Oh, now you tell me how
that makes you feel and shit.

42:49.066 --> 42:51.068
You wanna know how I feel?

42:51.402 --> 42:55.573
I feel like you're a ghetto Barbie
from the 99¢ store.

42:55.656 --> 42:59.076
We got Pregnant Maria, Gangbanger Maria,

42:59.159 --> 43:02.871
Jesus-Saves Maria,
Whatever-Weird-Cult-This-Is Maria.

43:02.955 --> 43:04.665
They're so cheap
that if you don't like one,

43:04.748 --> 43:07.293
you could just throw it away
and then get one next week.

43:11.130 --> 43:14.216
Well, at least
I'm trying to evolve, all right?

43:14.842 --> 43:18.846
And I own up to the shit I do,
not like you. Mother Superior, right?

43:18.929 --> 43:21.599
You can't even admit
that you got me ten years

43:21.682 --> 43:23.976
by lying through your fucking teeth,
can you?

43:27.313 --> 43:28.814
Guess who's back?

43:29.106 --> 43:31.900
Better late than never.
At least they can help with the cleanup.

43:33.777 --> 43:35.237
Flores? Shit.

43:35.321 --> 43:37.448
It's like a fucking traitor convention
up in here.

43:37.531 --> 43:38.824
What is Ruiz doing here?

43:38.907 --> 43:41.702
Oh, my God. So many opportunities
to continue my work.

43:41.785 --> 43:44.330
<i>Ay, dios mío. </i>This is like a telenovela.

43:44.413 --> 43:46.749
I feel like one of you
is about to go into a coma.

43:46.832 --> 43:48.208
Hey, what happened at the hearings?

43:48.292 --> 43:51.045
They're giving me time
to reopen my criminal case.

43:51.879 --> 43:54.131
It's good, 'cause it gives me a chance
to fight this...

43:55.466 --> 43:58.510
thanks to Karla and you guys.

43:58.844 --> 44:00.262
<i>Ay, nena,</i> thank God.

44:02.097 --> 44:03.182
What about you?

44:07.311 --> 44:09.688
Shit. I'm so sorry.

44:14.985 --> 44:18.030
All right, all right,
back to work. Karla, come with me.

44:27.039 --> 44:29.041
I think you should let your boys know.  Thank you.
-Just hurry up.

44:42.513 --> 44:43.472
<i>Hello?</i>

44:43.555 --> 44:46.725
Hello? I'm Abel and Benji's mom.

44:47.559 --> 44:50.562
<i>Please don't hang up.</i>
<i>I won't cause any trouble.</i>

44:50.938 --> 44:52.481
I just want to know how they are.

44:56.068 --> 44:59.405
They're fine.
They talk about you a lot.

44:59.488 --> 45:00.489
Please.

45:00.906 --> 45:03.951
Would you let me talk to them
for a moment?

45:10.624 --> 45:12.209
<i> You're on speaker.</i>

45:12.292 --> 45:13.293
<i>Mama?</i>

45:13.377 --> 45:15.129
<i>-Mijo!</i>
Where are you?

45:15.212 --> 45:18.757
Mama, they took our cat
and my Pokémon cards.

45:18.841 --> 45:20.509
<i>When are you coming back?</i>

45:22.511 --> 45:25.973
I'm working real hard
on getting back to you, okay?

45:27.182 --> 45:29.893
I'm going to have to be away
for a little while,

45:29.977 --> 45:31.311
<i>but I'm coming back.</i>

45:31.395 --> 45:32.604
But when?

45:32.688 --> 45:36.400
I don't know yet, but soon.

45:36.775 --> 45:39.194
You have to know
that no matter what happens,

45:39.278 --> 45:41.989
no matter what anyone tells you,

45:42.072 --> 45:45.409
I will not stop
until we're together again.

45:47.828 --> 45:49.955
Will you be here for my birthday?

45:56.754 --> 46:02.259
If I'm not, it just means
that I'm still on my way, okay?

46:03.677 --> 46:05.512
<i>But it might take me a little while.</i>

46:06.930 --> 46:09.808
<i>So, until then, you two need</i>
<i>to take care of each other.</i>

46:09.892 --> 46:14.730
<i>Remind each other to drink water</i>
<i>and zip up your jackets.</i>

46:14.813 --> 46:17.691
And you know how when you were little

46:18.525 --> 46:22.571
and you'd get real angry or sad,

46:23.197 --> 46:26.033
<i>we used to talk about using your words.</i>

46:26.116 --> 46:27.868
Well, you're gonna have to do that.

46:28.368 --> 46:31.830
You're gonna have to tell people
what you need.

46:33.499 --> 46:36.502
If there's something
you don't understand or if...

46:38.670 --> 46:39.880
something hurts...

46:42.883 --> 46:44.468
or if someone hurts you...

46:46.762 --> 46:49.181
you're gonna need
to speak up for yourselves,

46:50.516 --> 46:53.977
and for each other,
because I won't be there to do it for you.

46:57.231 --> 46:59.858
I love you both more than anything.

47:02.027 --> 47:04.321
Never forget how much I love you.

47:39.815 --> 47:42.484
Could you take one with my camera?

47:49.908 --> 47:51.076
Thank you.

47:59.042 --> 47:59.960
Piper.

48:01.003 --> 48:02.754
-Hi.

48:03.088 --> 48:06.466
You're going to be such a treat
to look at all evening.

48:06.550 --> 48:07.801
You look beautiful.

48:09.094 --> 48:11.013
I can't believe that this is your life.

48:11.096 --> 48:13.974
Hardly. It's fun to play dress-up
every now and then.

48:14.474 --> 48:17.603
Come. Let me show you around,
introduce you to my people.

48:27.321 --> 48:30.157
Guys, this is Piper.

48:30.240 --> 48:31.491
Piper, this is Andy,

48:31.575 --> 48:33.911
-our in-house design guru.
-Hello.

48:33.994 --> 48:36.622
And this is Luz,
our incredible photographer.

48:36.705 --> 48:39.750
-Zelda, excuse me.

48:40.042 --> 48:42.210
So, you're the one
Zelda won't shut up about.

48:42.294 --> 48:43.420
Oh, no, no, no. I doubt it.

48:43.503 --> 48:45.422
What?
-Andy, not cool.

48:45.505 --> 48:48.425
So, um, Piper, what do you do?

48:48.508 --> 48:49.343
I'm in accounting.

48:49.426 --> 48:52.387
But I'm thinking of transitioning
into something more meaningful.

48:52.471 --> 48:54.056
Maybe in the nonprofit sector.

48:54.139 --> 48:56.475
I love what Zelda does, what you two do.

48:56.558 --> 48:59.227
Send me your resume
and what you're interested in.

48:59.311 --> 49:01.188
I always have friends looking for people.

49:01.271 --> 49:03.273
Thanks.
Yeah.

49:03.357 --> 49:04.608
-I'll take you up on that.
-Great.

49:04.900 --> 49:06.693
Although, full disclosure, I've done time.

49:07.444 --> 49:08.362
In prison.

49:09.655 --> 49:12.032
As an inmate. So, it might not be easy.

49:12.574 --> 49:15.577
Oh.  Um... That's...

49:19.414 --> 49:21.416
Litchfield.
It's a federal penitentiary upstate.

49:21.500 --> 49:25.253
Oh, I read about that place on the back
cover of this book that just came out.

49:25.337 --> 49:28.256
The one by that woman who baked
cranberry bread with 50 Cent?

49:28.340 --> 49:30.133
Judy King wrote a memoir?

49:30.217 --> 49:31.760
Racy for an old swan.

49:31.843 --> 49:34.012
I hope my stamina holds up half as well.

49:34.805 --> 49:36.139
Evening, everyone.

49:37.182 --> 49:41.561
Walking in, you probably noticed
dozens of candles lighting your way.

49:41.853 --> 49:45.023
Each one of those candles
represents a Syrian child

49:45.107 --> 49:47.776
the Karam Foundation has helped this year.

49:47.859 --> 49:54.449
Working alongside Lina and her team
has taught me that no matter the setbacks,

49:54.533 --> 49:58.245
we must pick ourselves up
and move forward.

49:58.328 --> 50:01.540
We must continue
to find hope despite despair.

50:08.213 --> 50:12.009
The Karam Foundation
doesn't just rebuild schools,

50:12.092 --> 50:13.760
it builds futures.

50:13.844 --> 50:19.099
The Karam homes are environments
that encourage invention and innovation,

50:19.808 --> 50:22.394
a sense of adventure and entrepreneurship.

50:23.645 --> 50:25.689
Hey, uh, thank you for seeing me so late.

50:25.772 --> 50:30.652
-Sorry, it's been, uh, a long day.

50:32.571 --> 50:36.074
A woman at the detention center I work in,

50:36.992 --> 50:40.787
I found out her pregnancy
is a result of rape.

50:41.705 --> 50:43.081
That is awful.

50:43.957 --> 50:47.461
She wants an abortion,
but ICE won't let her have one.

50:47.544 --> 50:49.087
They care about the baby so much.

50:49.171 --> 50:52.340
They want her to keep it,
at least until they deport her

50:52.424 --> 50:54.468
and it's not their problem anymore.

50:55.135 --> 50:56.136
I'm so sorry.

51:00.640 --> 51:04.186
What am I doing, bringing a kid
into a world that's so...

51:05.395 --> 51:06.980
fucking fucked?

51:08.273 --> 51:09.316
What do you mean?

51:11.860 --> 51:13.361
I...

51:14.279 --> 51:15.697
I don't want a baby.

51:16.448 --> 51:19.284
Hey, Natalie, it's okay.

51:26.249 --> 51:27.250
It's okay.

51:28.085 --> 51:29.586
It's a big decision.

51:29.669 --> 51:31.588
Why don't you sleep on it, talk to Joe?

51:31.671 --> 51:33.381
Your IVF isn't until Friday.

51:33.465 --> 51:35.467
You have plenty of time
to change your mind.

51:35.550 --> 51:37.761
Actually, I don't.

51:44.017 --> 51:45.894
-I'm nine weeks along.
-Natalie--

51:45.977 --> 51:47.979
It's a Christmas miracle,

51:48.522 --> 51:51.775
except it's not Christmas
and I don't want a miracle.

51:54.486 --> 51:58.657
I know it is a lot to ask,
but I am asking.

52:00.325 --> 52:01.284
Please.

52:13.672 --> 52:17.759
It's a pity you want an abortion,
given how much you've spent on IVF.

52:25.100 --> 52:27.519
What in Bob's name
could be taking so long?

52:27.602 --> 52:29.354
My shift was over 15 minutes ago.

52:29.437 --> 52:31.439
I got cheeseburger macaroni
waitin' for me.

52:31.523 --> 52:34.651
I'll put everything away.
We'll finish the rest tomorrow.

52:40.073 --> 52:41.158
What the...

52:50.584 --> 52:53.086
<i> Hello</i>

52:53.170 --> 52:54.754
What is your mother's name?

52:59.384 --> 53:01.052
Whose phone is this?

53:09.686 --> 53:13.815
How did you get the owner of De Beers
to whip and nae nae?

53:14.482 --> 53:16.318
It's what I do, baby.

53:16.401 --> 53:18.278
And you do it so well.

53:18.361 --> 53:20.405
Zelda, that was so much fun.

53:20.697 --> 53:21.990
Thank you so much.

53:22.073 --> 53:23.700
So, are you gonna invite me in,

53:23.783 --> 53:27.412
so I can finally meet that lizard
that lives in your closet?

53:27.495 --> 53:28.663
Is that a euphemism?

53:29.873 --> 53:31.291
Do you want it to be?

53:34.586 --> 53:36.504
Zelda, I do.

53:39.549 --> 53:40.717
But I can't.

53:43.386 --> 53:44.429
I'm sorry.

53:46.306 --> 53:52.103
You do realize your inner conflict
only makes me like you more, right?

54:11.915 --> 54:12.832
Jesus!

54:14.000 --> 54:15.126
What are you doing here?

54:15.794 --> 54:17.295
Does Alex know about her?

54:19.172 --> 54:20.423
What are you talking about?

54:20.507 --> 54:23.969
She thinks you're waiting for her,
like a good little wife.

54:24.678 --> 54:28.598
What I'm doing and what Alex is doing
is none of your business.

54:28.682 --> 54:30.392
Except it is.

54:31.768 --> 54:34.896
If you don't get out of here right now,
I'm gonna call the police.

54:34.980 --> 54:36.898
She's ready to move on, you know.

54:38.149 --> 54:39.025
With me.

54:39.693 --> 54:42.153
Except she's scared of hurting you.

54:43.029 --> 54:46.032
Meanwhile, you're out here,
livin' the life.

54:46.408 --> 54:47.867
You're fucking crazy.

54:50.203 --> 54:51.454
How do you know where I live?

54:51.538 --> 54:54.916
Who do you think delivered
the stupid parrot shirt Alex sent you?

54:57.627 --> 54:59.921
You built a new life
for yourself, Chapman.

55:01.965 --> 55:03.925
You should let Alex do the same.

55:19.691 --> 55:21.151
What's gonna happen to us?

55:22.652 --> 55:24.279
That's for the warden to decide.

55:43.715 --> 55:45.425

55:49.179 --> 55:50.722
You, uh... You all right?

55:51.056 --> 55:53.183
Yeah, I'm fine.

56:44.317 --> 56:47.112

<i>was supposed to last forever.</i>

56:47.987 --> 56:52.158

56:52.242 --> 56:54.077

57:10.885 --> 57:11.928
I'm sorry.

57:29.654 --> 57:30.864

57:33.116 --> 57:35.285
What is it? Hey.

57:37.036 --> 57:38.580
So fucked up.

57:39.706 --> 57:41.124

57:41.916 --> 57:44.878
-Got feisty. Had to sedate her.

57:44.961 --> 57:48.006

58:35.929 --> 58:38.306
Go in. Grab a bed.

58:39.849 --> 58:41.768
Pick one. Any one that's available.
