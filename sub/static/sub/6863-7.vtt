WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:02.370
This is my boyfriend...
Joel Stephens.

00:03.504 --> 00:04.638
The Cicada's Lament
is my favorite book ever.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.708
Zoe, I love you, but I don't
even know if I can write here.

00:07.808 --> 00:09.143
Halloween night,
you said you had

00:09.243 --> 00:10.144
something special planned.

00:10.943 --> 00:11.245
You thought I was
gonna propose?

00:11.812 --> 00:12.313
This isn't an ultimatum.

00:13.247 --> 00:14.148
I just need to know
we're on the same path.

00:14.915 --> 00:15.716
Brick seems
meaner than usual.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.185
He and Shelby
were gonna elope,

00:17.951 --> 00:18.286
but he broke up
with her instead,

00:18.919 --> 00:19.353
which he obviously regrets.

00:20.154 --> 00:21.222
Meet my brothers:
Rudy, Rocket,

00:21.989 --> 00:22.323
and the scruffy
one's Chicken.

00:23.257 --> 00:25.093
I love my brothers,
but chaos follows them.

00:25.193 --> 00:27.061
We are not going
to get together.

00:27.161 --> 00:28.296
Lavon would break my kneecaps.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.565
Look me in the eye and tell me
you don't want to kiss me.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.706
(George and Lynly laughing)

00:38.806 --> 00:40.208
GEORGE: Oh, Lyn...
(kisses)

00:40.308 --> 00:42.042
...as much as I hate to say it,

00:42.143 --> 00:43.544
I think that
it's time we get ready

00:43.644 --> 00:45.045
and go to relay practice.

00:45.146 --> 00:46.547
Isn't one of
the perks of being

00:46.647 --> 00:49.283
the assistant coach
that you can be late?

00:49.383 --> 00:49.917
No.

00:50.017 --> 00:52.453
Lynly...
Fillmore has won

00:52.553 --> 00:55.489
the Mobile Bay Cross-Country
Relay Race four straight years.

00:55.589 --> 00:58.326
Which means BlueBell
has lost four straight years.

00:58.426 --> 01:00.261
And if we lose
a fifth straight year,

01:00.361 --> 01:01.795
do you know what happens?

01:01.895 --> 01:05.065
We don't get asked
back a sixth...
Asked back a
sixth time.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.334
...time.
Mm-hmm.

01:06.434 --> 01:09.069
Look, we have a real
good shot at winning

01:09.170 --> 01:10.371
with you on the team,

01:10.471 --> 01:12.072
and I promised Lavon victory.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.608
You're so adorable
when you dork out.

01:15.676 --> 01:16.810
But you know what?

01:16.910 --> 01:19.079
Uh... speaking of Lavon...

01:19.180 --> 01:20.314
(clears throat)

01:20.414 --> 01:23.751
...do you feel weird at all
that we haven't

01:23.851 --> 01:25.619
told him about this?

01:25.719 --> 01:27.221
Because I... I do.

01:27.321 --> 01:30.224
That depends on what
exactly "this" is.

01:30.324 --> 01:32.160
If it's a relationship,
I totally agree.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.361
We should tell him now.

01:33.461 --> 01:34.695
I'll go get my phone.

01:34.795 --> 01:35.696
Oh, no, no, hold on.

01:35.796 --> 01:36.697
No, no.

01:36.797 --> 01:37.665
I... you know,
I could...

01:38.599 --> 01:39.433
I don't know that
I would call it that.

01:40.368 --> 01:41.535
(laughs) We don't really
need to label it.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.272
You know, but we should
tell him something.

01:44.372 --> 01:47.475
So how would that
conversation go, exactly?

01:47.575 --> 01:50.110
"Hey, Lavon, I'm having
non-committal sex

01:50.211 --> 01:51.512
with your beloved cousin."

01:53.514 --> 01:54.415
Mm-mm.

01:55.416 --> 01:56.517
Wow, that really does not
sound good, does it?

01:57.318 --> 01:58.552
Not if you
like your face.
Oh, boy.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.821
I do. I re...
I really do like it.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.191
*

02:09.930 --> 02:11.799
Were you trying
to stare me awake again?

02:11.899 --> 02:13.267
No.

02:13.367 --> 02:14.668
But now that you're awake,

02:14.768 --> 02:15.803
what's going on?

02:16.870 --> 02:18.472
You were not here
when I went to bed last night.

02:18.572 --> 02:19.807
What time did
you get in?

02:19.907 --> 02:21.609
Uh...

02:21.709 --> 02:23.277
I don't know.

02:23.377 --> 02:25.746
Um, sometime between last call

02:25.846 --> 02:27.748
and, um... now.

02:27.848 --> 02:29.483
Huh.

02:29.583 --> 02:30.584
Last call?

02:31.519 --> 02:32.253
I-I thought you were
writing last night.

02:32.886 --> 02:33.421
You know,
a lot of writers

02:34.054 --> 02:35.689
drink while they're working.

02:35.789 --> 02:36.924
Ernest Hemingway,

02:37.024 --> 02:38.926
uh, Dorothy Parker,
F. Scott Fitzgerald...

02:39.026 --> 02:40.228
So you were writing.

02:41.128 --> 02:43.697
No, I blew it off
to play pool with Wade.

02:43.797 --> 02:44.832
Oh.

02:44.932 --> 02:46.400
(laughs)

02:46.500 --> 02:50.304
All right, what, uh...
what's with the judgey "oh"?

02:50.404 --> 02:51.439
No, it's Wade.

02:52.440 --> 02:53.374
I don't get why you like
hanging out with him.

02:54.442 --> 02:55.843
He's an irresponsible
derelict, and you are not.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.278
Wade is hilarious.

02:57.378 --> 02:58.679
He tells the funniest stories.

02:58.779 --> 02:59.680
Stories?

02:59.780 --> 03:00.848
Like what? About who?

03:00.948 --> 03:02.716
Well, no, it's not...

03:02.816 --> 03:04.585
it's more like the way
that he looks at things.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.455
I mean, the guy does not
have a care in the world.

03:07.555 --> 03:09.590
It is amazing to be
around someone like that.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.492
Well, yeah, unless
you care about the world.

03:11.592 --> 03:13.894
All right, look,
I have to get to work,

03:13.994 --> 03:15.496
and apparently,
so do you.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.333
Happy writing.
Happy doctoring.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.776
(stopwatch beeps)
All right, not bad.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.210
Not bad,
but we can do better.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.412
Now, look, Fillmore
is not gonna let us

03:31.512 --> 03:33.447
live it down if we lose
on our home turf.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.482
So catch your breath,
and then we're gonna

03:34.582 --> 03:36.917
work on hand-offs, all right?

03:37.017 --> 03:38.986
You and I both know
those times

03:39.086 --> 03:40.354
aren't where
they need to be.

03:40.454 --> 03:41.489
Want me to start
training,

03:42.490 --> 03:43.591
just in case you need
to drop the dead weight?

03:44.558 --> 03:46.294
Uh, Meatball and Crickett
are our alternates.

03:46.394 --> 03:48.429
We-we got it covered.

03:48.529 --> 03:49.363
Yeah.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.364
Yeah, sure.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.365
No problem.

03:51.465 --> 03:52.600
Cramp! Cramp. Cramp.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.269
Oh, oh, we-we cannot
have our star runner

03:55.369 --> 03:56.770
with a charley horse.

03:56.870 --> 03:57.938
Uh, George,

03:58.038 --> 03:59.307
massage Lynly's calf.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.509
Uh, but I was
just about to give

04:01.609 --> 04:03.311
my motivational speech
on how the mind

04:03.411 --> 04:05.245
is our most
important muscle.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.580
That can wait.

04:06.680 --> 04:07.581
Calf.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.753
Yo, hit me, T.L.

04:12.853 --> 04:14.688
My pleasure.

04:14.788 --> 04:15.689
(sighs):
Ah.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.927
Ew!
Aren't you all sweaty?

04:20.027 --> 04:22.029
Well, I have just the treat
for all your hard work.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.731
Homemade jam.

04:23.831 --> 04:25.766
I love jam!

04:25.866 --> 04:26.867
No jam for the runners.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.270
ANNABETH:
Oh. Um...

04:32.072 --> 04:34.408
So, I haven't
seen you in a while.

04:34.508 --> 04:35.576
How you been?

04:35.676 --> 04:37.711
Good.
You know, busy with the team.

04:37.811 --> 04:38.712
Hmm.

04:38.812 --> 04:39.713
Uh, you?

04:39.813 --> 04:41.482
Good. So good.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.283
Busy with my jamming.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.785
Yeah, you seem to be
enjoying that.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.521
Oh, yes,
it's a fascinating process.

04:47.621 --> 04:50.458
You know, sanitizing the jars
and skimming the foam

04:50.558 --> 04:52.826
and testing the gel...

04:52.926 --> 04:55.629
Yeah, that-that does
sound fascinating.

04:55.729 --> 04:57.498
Um, so...

04:57.598 --> 05:00.368
any chance you'd... like
to have dinner tonight?

05:00.468 --> 05:01.702
Sorry, I'm-I'm training.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.371
At night?

05:04.071 --> 05:05.639
I got training videos.

05:05.739 --> 05:07.475
Gonna be
watching them all night.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.477
Can't be too prepared.

05:09.577 --> 05:10.411
Yeah.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.845
More time for jam!

05:11.945 --> 05:12.913
(laughs)
Yeah.

05:13.013 --> 05:14.081
Yay!

05:14.181 --> 05:15.015
Okay.

05:15.115 --> 05:16.450
Mm-hmm.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.654
Be my taste buds.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.090
DON TODD (over TV):
 Don Todd

05:23.190 --> 05:24.324
in the Horn of Africa.

05:24.425 --> 05:26.394
An athletic stance...

05:26.494 --> 05:27.995
I want a coffee
and an explanation.

05:28.095 --> 05:30.498
There is no explaining
Don Todd.

05:30.598 --> 05:34.402
No, what are you doing
spending so much time with Joel?

05:34.502 --> 05:35.836
I don't know.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.638
Painting each other's nails,
braiding each other's hair.

05:37.738 --> 05:38.939
I know what you're really up to.

05:39.039 --> 05:40.374
Oh, yeah? What's that?

05:41.108 --> 05:42.342
I don't know.

05:43.511 --> 05:44.845
But I know it's something,
and I'm going to figure it out.

05:44.945 --> 05:45.746
Good luck with that.

05:46.547 --> 05:46.914
DON TODD:
...and run like hell!

05:47.481 --> 05:48.716
Did you see those teeth?

05:48.816 --> 05:50.518
I saw The Omen.

05:50.618 --> 05:51.519
They'll eat your car.

05:51.619 --> 05:54.354
What am I gonna have today?

05:54.455 --> 05:55.423
Well, let's see.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.057
Yesterday, you had
the eggs hollandaise,

05:57.825 --> 05:58.526
the day before that,
the crepes,

05:59.393 --> 06:00.060
and the day before that,
the frittata,

06:01.161 --> 06:01.495
so I think that you've had
everything on the menu.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.397
You are right.

06:03.497 --> 06:04.965
Maybe it's time to try
another restaurant.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.367
Or we could eat at home.

06:07.468 --> 06:09.369
Each of us
in our own homes.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.504
Lemon Meringue, look.

06:11.572 --> 06:12.840
I know we have been spending
a lot of time together,

06:12.940 --> 06:13.974
but I am worried about you.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.509
You gave up
the Rammer Jammer,

06:15.609 --> 06:17.811
your offer on Fancie's
wasn't accepted...

06:17.911 --> 06:19.780
Daddy, I'm looking for
the next chapter in my life,

06:19.880 --> 06:21.148
and frankly, you should
be doing the same.

06:21.248 --> 06:22.483
Me?
Mm-hmm.

06:22.583 --> 06:24.585
Well, how did this
become about me?

06:24.685 --> 06:26.053
Well, I happen to know
that Mrs. O'Connell

06:26.153 --> 06:28.021
just came back from
her yoga retreat...
Oh. No.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.390
...and it has been over a year
since William passed,

06:30.491 --> 06:31.625
and you should
ask her out.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.160
No, I don't think so... you...

06:33.260 --> 06:35.395
She is not my type.

06:35.496 --> 06:36.597
And she has this

06:36.697 --> 06:38.632
oddly disturbing
mole on her neck.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.533
Oh.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.101
Daddy, you are
making excuses.

06:41.802 --> 06:42.570
Well, maybe I am,
but I, uh...

06:43.671 --> 06:45.539
The truth is, I'm just not
over this whole Shelby mess.

06:45.639 --> 06:46.674
I need more time.

06:46.774 --> 06:47.541
Nonsense.

06:48.241 --> 06:48.676
It has been
over six months,

06:49.376 --> 06:49.810
and you broke up
with Shelby

06:50.711 --> 06:51.411
because she was
the wrong person for you

06:52.279 --> 06:52.680
and you wanted
to find the right one.

06:53.213 --> 06:53.914
You know it's true.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.817
You know, all I know right now
is I've lost my appetite.

06:56.917 --> 07:00.420
Just can't stop thinking about
that creepy mole...

07:00.521 --> 07:01.021
(groans):
Oh.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.023
Whew.

07:08.696 --> 07:11.198
Getting ready to make
the world's largest PB&J?

07:11.298 --> 07:13.767
I've had a lot of
time alone lately,

07:13.867 --> 07:16.570
so I've taken up jam-making!

07:16.670 --> 07:18.572
But my house
started to look like

07:18.672 --> 07:20.841
Hoarders: Jam Edition,

07:20.941 --> 07:22.943
so I am sharing it.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.945
Loganberry quince?

07:25.979 --> 07:26.980
Yum. I think.

07:28.081 --> 07:29.149
I don't even know what
either of those things are.

07:29.249 --> 07:30.150
Why are you alone?

07:30.250 --> 07:31.785
Where's Lavon?

07:31.885 --> 07:35.222
Things with Lavon
have been a little... strange.

07:35.322 --> 07:38.158
A few weeks ago,
I asked him to make sure

07:38.258 --> 07:40.561
that we're on
the same path, and...

07:40.661 --> 07:42.229
I didn't mean it
as an ultimatum.

07:42.329 --> 07:45.165
I even said,
"This is not an ultimatum."

07:45.265 --> 07:46.867
But all he heard
was "ultimatum"?

07:46.967 --> 07:47.801
Loud and clear.

07:48.536 --> 07:48.802
Well, you need
to talk to him

07:49.503 --> 07:49.970
and straighten
things out.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.004
I've tried.

07:52.072 --> 07:53.641
But he doesn't want to have
anything to do with me.

07:53.741 --> 07:55.609
Well, then try again.
You have no choice.

07:55.709 --> 07:57.010
Hey, on the bright
side, though,

07:57.110 --> 07:59.079
loganberry quince--
it's actually pretty good.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.648
(phone ringing)
Ooh, sorry.

08:00.748 --> 08:01.882
Joel's agent.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.183
That's weird.

08:03.283 --> 08:06.754
Hey, Bets, how are you?

08:06.854 --> 08:10.123
Oh, no, I don't know why
he's not answering his phone.

08:10.223 --> 08:11.224
Huh.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.561
Yeah, well, I'm sure there's
an explanation for it.

08:14.327 --> 08:15.495
I will have him
give you a call.

08:15.596 --> 08:16.830
Okay, bye.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.966
Joel's first three chapters
were due yesterday,

08:19.066 --> 08:20.634
and he didn't
turn them in.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.202
I didn't even know
he had a deadline.

08:22.302 --> 08:23.571
What do you think happened?

08:23.671 --> 08:24.705
(sighs)

08:24.805 --> 08:25.873
I know what happened.

08:25.973 --> 08:26.707
Or wh happened.

08:27.340 --> 08:27.775
Now, if you'll excuse me,

08:28.576 --> 08:29.209
I have a bartender
to kill, so...

08:29.309 --> 08:31.779
Uh-bup-bup!

08:31.879 --> 08:33.513
Mm-hmm.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.552
WADE:
Come on.
JOEL:
Yep, that's right.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.754
What is that, anyway?
That's-that's...

08:40.854 --> 08:42.823
that's called
fair play. Yeah.
Fair...?

08:44.057 --> 08:44.858
Video games?

08:45.726 --> 08:46.860
What are you doing
playing video games?

08:47.895 --> 08:49.129
Your agent just called me
because you weren't

08:49.229 --> 08:49.963
answering your phone.

08:50.764 --> 08:51.231
Your chapters were
due yesterday.

08:51.732 --> 08:52.766
Did you know that?

08:53.867 --> 08:55.803
I'm sorry, I didn't realize
we had any homework, Mom.

08:55.903 --> 08:58.038
(laughs)

08:58.138 --> 08:59.807
Well, you shouldn't have
kept him out all night.

08:59.907 --> 09:01.975
And you shouldn't be
exploding bad guys now!

09:02.075 --> 09:04.044
I don't know why
you're yelling at me.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.946
I was just at my work,

09:06.046 --> 09:08.081
pouring beers like
a responsible adult,

09:08.181 --> 09:11.084
when in comes this guy,
begging for me to blow it off.

09:11.184 --> 09:12.152
Is that true?

09:13.721 --> 09:15.055
That is so not like you.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.257
Yeah, well, you know what else
isn't like me?

09:17.357 --> 09:18.792
Is, um, sitting down
at my computer

09:18.892 --> 09:20.560
and not being able
to write a word.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.663
What-what are you saying?

09:22.763 --> 09:23.964
Oh, what am I saying?

09:24.064 --> 09:25.699
Uh, I guess I'm-I'm...
I'm saying I'm broken.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.801
Okay? My first book was...
it was clearly

09:27.901 --> 09:29.002
some kind of, uh, you know,

09:30.037 --> 09:30.638
monkeys typing Shakespeare,
uh, type of fluke,

09:31.639 --> 09:32.773
and I'm terrified that
all it did was set me up

09:32.873 --> 09:34.842
for an epic sophomore slump.

09:34.942 --> 09:36.844
Uh, because now every thought
that comes into my head,

09:36.944 --> 09:39.279
there's just this voice
that just yells, "No!

09:39.379 --> 09:40.580
Not good enough!"

09:41.514 --> 09:42.149
And now, the thoughts
don't even come around

09:42.249 --> 09:43.984
anymore, so...

09:44.084 --> 09:46.586
That's what I'm, you know,
dealing with here.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.288
Okay.

09:48.388 --> 09:49.589
It's okay.
You know what?

09:49.690 --> 09:50.691
We're gonna
get through this.

09:50.791 --> 09:53.260
But first, we need
to get you home.

09:53.360 --> 09:54.828
WADE: Or...
(clears throat)

09:54.928 --> 09:56.930
...we could play
one more game.

09:57.030 --> 09:58.598
Don't you think
you've done enough?

10:00.033 --> 10:02.135
Bye, Joel.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.270
Thanks, man.

10:03.370 --> 10:04.905
(booing)

10:06.373 --> 10:08.809
(car horn honks)

10:08.909 --> 10:11.044
(seagulls calling)

10:11.144 --> 10:13.146
(birds singing)

10:20.888 --> 10:22.055
Hey, uh,
sorry to interrupt.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.324
Oh, no, no, no.
It's an honor, Joel Stephens.

10:24.424 --> 10:25.392
Okay.

10:25.492 --> 10:27.695
Look, writing here
isn't working.

10:27.795 --> 10:29.162
My germ-phobia is in overdrive,

10:29.262 --> 10:31.331
the smooth jazz is killing me,
and that "brain smoothie"

10:31.431 --> 10:32.632
you gave me
is not sitting well.

10:32.733 --> 10:33.867
You're fine.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.302
You know, just take...
(inhales)

10:35.402 --> 10:36.636
...deep breaths.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.372
I think I need a Valium
or a Vicodin or a Xanax.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.341
Really, any of your...
any of the alphabet drugs.

10:41.441 --> 10:44.344
I can give you
a lollipop!

10:44.444 --> 10:46.046
Okay.
Look.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.148
Just stay calm, okay?
I will be out soon.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.820
Um, what was that?

10:52.920 --> 10:54.888
Oh, Joel has
writer's block.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.056
No!

10:56.156 --> 10:58.792
He's gonna be fine;
I'm helping him.

10:58.892 --> 11:00.260
I have been
counting down the days

11:00.360 --> 11:02.229
until his next book
comes out: 247.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.064
Your heart is actually racing.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.800
If Joel Stephens can't write,
his fans will blame you,

11:06.900 --> 11:08.668
and fans are
the meanest people there are.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.703
Blame me?

11:10.603 --> 11:11.004
No, they should blame Wade,
you know,

11:11.972 --> 11:12.906
because he's the one
who's been enabling him.

11:13.941 --> 11:14.775
All I know is Joel Stephens
was able to write

11:15.475 --> 11:16.009
just fine until you came along.

11:16.109 --> 11:17.277
(gasps)

11:17.377 --> 11:18.345
What if you're his Yoko Ono?

11:19.346 --> 11:21.782
Yoko did not hurt
John Lennon's creativity.

11:21.882 --> 11:22.983
She was his muse.
Yeah,

11:24.051 --> 11:27.087
but all anyone remembers
is she killed the Beatles.

11:27.187 --> 11:27.955
You don't want to be

11:28.789 --> 11:29.823
the one that killed
Joel Stephens.

11:31.759 --> 11:32.860
(clapping)

11:33.961 --> 11:35.095
Race is in two days, people.
We got to make this count!

11:36.129 --> 11:38.098
Wally, do you want to be seen
as the team old guy?

11:38.198 --> 11:39.166
Pick up the pace, man.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.401
Meatball, do you always
want to be an alternate?

11:41.501 --> 11:43.036
Come on, dig deeper, dig deeper.

11:43.136 --> 11:45.405
Lynly, tone it down
just a little bit.

11:45.505 --> 11:46.974
You're making people feel bad.

11:47.074 --> 11:48.842
George, you know, you
may be assistant coach,

11:48.942 --> 11:50.744
but it doesn't mean you
get out of practicing.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.212
Hit it.
Yes, sir.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.082
Oh, no.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.950
No. Yo, Gainey.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.119
You know this ain't
Fillmore, right?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.721
I mean, you can tell because
we can actually see each other

12:01.822 --> 12:02.856
through the air.
(chuckles)

12:03.857 --> 12:06.026
Well, I'm having my team
train here in BlueBell

12:06.126 --> 12:07.861
just so they'll
get a little taste

12:07.961 --> 12:10.230
of how it feels
when they win here in BlueBell.

12:10.330 --> 12:13.000
It's a shame
you didn't tell me the plan.

12:13.100 --> 12:14.734
I-I could've saved you the trip.

12:14.835 --> 12:16.436
I got a secret weapon this year.

12:16.536 --> 12:17.871
Oh, you see, uh,

12:17.971 --> 12:19.439
my cousin, Lynly,

12:19.539 --> 12:22.876
went to college
on a track scholarship.

12:22.976 --> 12:24.177
Won state championship,

12:24.277 --> 12:26.013
uh, twice.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.414
So that thing
you're gonna be tasting,

12:27.514 --> 12:29.282
it's, uh, defeat.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.318
(grunts, chuckles)

12:33.921 --> 12:35.422
WADE: Just 'cause I was
married to your sister

12:35.522 --> 12:36.790
doesn't mean
you get free beer.

12:36.890 --> 12:38.225
Six beers.
No.

12:38.325 --> 12:40.227
Fine, nine beers.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.294
No.

12:42.262 --> 12:42.796
Look, y'all snuck out
the bathroom window

12:43.696 --> 12:44.531
last night just to skip out
on a bill.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.766
Uh, 12 beers.

12:46.867 --> 12:48.101
What are y'all doing
here, anyway?

12:49.336 --> 12:51.204
You get run out of whatever
the hell swamp y'all live in?

12:51.304 --> 12:53.406
Bar near our house
won't serve us anymore

12:53.506 --> 12:55.008
'cause we didn't pay our tab.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.276
Don't tell him that.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.778
We thought you'd serve us
'cause we're family.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.248
We used to be married
to your sister.

13:01.348 --> 13:02.382
Your mother?

13:02.482 --> 13:04.217
Your sis...

13:04.317 --> 13:06.319
Look, clearly somebody
served y'all beer this morning.

13:06.419 --> 13:07.955
Go back there, okay?

13:08.055 --> 13:09.122
'Cause you're
not getting any here.

13:09.222 --> 13:11.791
But we're thirsty.
I got that.

13:11.892 --> 13:13.193
Are you saying we're not good
for the money?

13:13.293 --> 13:14.494
Hey, you're not
as dumb as you look.

13:14.594 --> 13:16.796
Yes, we are.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.331
You're gonna
regret this, Wade.

13:18.431 --> 13:20.200
Oh, all right.

13:21.568 --> 13:23.937
So thirsty.

13:26.406 --> 13:27.474
Hi.

13:27.574 --> 13:28.475
So I have been doing

13:29.442 --> 13:30.510
some reading
on studies of writer's block,

13:31.711 --> 13:33.947
and they suggested recreating
an environment of success.

13:34.047 --> 13:37.384
So, I'm going to turn
the Rammer Jammer into Luna.

13:37.484 --> 13:38.818
It's the New York café

13:38.919 --> 13:40.253
where Joel wrote
 The Cicada's Lament.

13:40.353 --> 13:43.056
That is the dumbest idea
you've ever had,

13:43.156 --> 13:45.258
and you are chock-full
of dumb ideas.
Hey.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.360
Zoe, I'm trying to run
a business here, okay?

13:47.460 --> 13:49.496
You owe me, because you're
the one who distracted him.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.065
Can't help it if your boyfriend
finds me irresistible.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.101
You're just a novelty to him.
You and Joel are nothing alike,

13:54.201 --> 13:55.368
and I'd like
to keep it that way.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.104
Yeah, you keep
telling yourself that.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.238
Hey.

13:59.372 --> 14:01.208
(sighs)

14:07.280 --> 14:11.184
Hey, I know you don't
have time for dinner,

14:11.284 --> 14:13.853
so I thought maybe
we could share a quick pastry.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.355
I-I'm a little busy right now.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.090
Oh, that's why
they're bite-sized.

14:17.190 --> 14:18.191
I'm sorry, AnnaBeth,

14:19.159 --> 14:20.360
but this is the last practice
before the race.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.528
Every second counts.

14:21.628 --> 14:22.963
Are you sure?

14:24.297 --> 14:25.899
Of course, yeah.

14:25.999 --> 14:28.368
Go BlueBell!

14:28.468 --> 14:30.870
Hey, Lavon, have you decided
an order for the runners?

14:30.971 --> 14:31.939
Uh, no, not yet.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.140
Well, how hard can it be?

14:33.240 --> 14:34.942
Obviously Lynly's the anchor,

14:35.042 --> 14:35.875
George is the starter.

14:35.976 --> 14:37.177
That leaves me and Wanda.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.112
The pickin' chicken
could decide!

14:39.212 --> 14:40.580
I will make a decision
when I'm good and ready.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.282
I don't need anybody
pressuring me.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.984
I want to see
three-minute miles now.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.385
(whistle blows)
Go.

14:45.485 --> 14:46.653
Go on.

14:46.753 --> 14:48.421
(sighs)

14:48.521 --> 14:49.622
Yeah, Lavon,

14:50.723 --> 14:51.591
you know three-minute miles
are impossible, right?

14:51.691 --> 14:53.093
So?

14:53.193 --> 14:54.194
Is everything all right, man?

14:54.294 --> 14:58.431
It's just that, uh...
A.B. gave me an ultimatum.

14:58.531 --> 15:00.968
I mean, she said,
"This isn't an ultimatum,"

15:01.068 --> 15:03.903
but we all know that's code for
"This is a big fat ultimatum."

15:04.004 --> 15:05.973
Oh, yeah.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.240
Our whole relationship
is all wonky.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.142
Every time I look in her face,

15:09.242 --> 15:12.612
all I see is a question mark
and a clock.

15:12.712 --> 15:14.614
Well, what are you gonna do?

15:14.714 --> 15:16.549
I don't know.

15:16.649 --> 15:18.585
Keep avoiding her.
(chuckles)

15:18.685 --> 15:21.188
Well, good idea.

15:21.288 --> 15:22.322
(chuckles)

15:23.390 --> 15:24.357
But if that doesn't work,
then just let me know

15:25.425 --> 15:26.926
if there's anything
I can do to help, all right?

15:28.195 --> 15:30.130
You always got
my back, Tucker.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.066
No matter what.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.374
Oh.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.276
(door opens)

15:43.376 --> 15:45.612
Edward.

15:45.712 --> 15:47.647
How nice to see you.
Lemon.

15:47.747 --> 15:49.349
Hello.

15:49.449 --> 15:51.418
Um, I'm sorry

15:51.518 --> 15:54.454
about how things ended
up with Fancie's.

15:54.554 --> 15:55.488
Oh, nonsense.

15:56.556 --> 15:57.424
I mean, the highest bidder's
the highest bidder.

15:58.025 --> 15:59.426
But just out of curiosity,

15:59.526 --> 16:01.561
who was the lucky buyer?

16:01.661 --> 16:03.963
Uh...

16:04.064 --> 16:05.965
I'm not at liberty to say.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.235
It's business.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.636
Oh.

16:09.736 --> 16:11.071
Um, I should be going.

16:11.171 --> 16:12.372
But you just got here.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.407
Uh-huh. Bye-bye.

16:21.348 --> 16:23.383
GEORGE:
 Look, Lavon is my friend,

16:23.483 --> 16:25.518
and every time
I look him in the face

16:25.618 --> 16:27.220
and I don't say something
about us,

16:27.320 --> 16:29.656
I feel...
I feel like I'm lying to him.

16:29.756 --> 16:30.757
But just to be clear,

16:30.857 --> 16:32.592
we're still not
in a relationship?

16:32.692 --> 16:35.395
Not in a relationship per se,

16:35.495 --> 16:38.598
but we have to say something
to him, anything.

16:38.698 --> 16:40.333
You know what it is?
It's his eyes.

16:40.433 --> 16:42.069
'Cause every time you look
into his eyes,

16:42.169 --> 16:43.236
you just want
to spill everything.

16:43.336 --> 16:44.671
Don't make me do it anymore,
please.

16:44.771 --> 16:47.774
Okay, but can we wait
until after the race?

16:47.874 --> 16:49.209
It means so much to him.

16:49.309 --> 16:50.610
I don't want to ruin it.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.079
Of course.

16:52.179 --> 16:53.580
Good. And on the plus side,

16:53.680 --> 16:55.515
we don't have to wait
to do this.

16:55.615 --> 16:58.451
Oh.

16:58.551 --> 17:00.353
All right.

17:00.453 --> 17:03.556
But I do, hey, I do have to say,
that I heard that runners

17:03.656 --> 17:05.625
should not do something
like this before a race.

17:05.724 --> 17:07.594
Hasn't hurt us before.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.162
Hmm.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.431
Oh! Oh!

17:11.531 --> 17:12.432
Ow.

17:12.531 --> 17:13.766
Are-are you okay?

17:13.866 --> 17:15.167
Oh, my knee!

17:16.236 --> 17:17.036
Okay, no, no, just sit
down, sit down, sit down.

17:17.604 --> 17:18.037
Just sit right there.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.172
I'm gonna call Brick or Zoe

17:19.571 --> 17:20.272
right away.

17:21.108 --> 17:22.108
(sighs)
I've had this happen before.

17:23.109 --> 17:25.244
Not a sex injury, my knee.

17:25.345 --> 17:28.047
And I know
what they're gonna say.

17:28.147 --> 17:30.450
I won't be running in the race.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.394
MAN (chanting):
Oh, hey, what do you say?

17:41.494 --> 17:42.695
RUNNERS:
We love to run every day.

17:42.795 --> 17:45.064
MAN:
One, two, three, four.

17:45.165 --> 17:46.833
GAINEY:
Come on, Dusty, work, work!

17:46.933 --> 17:48.301
Drive them long legs,
drive them!

17:49.369 --> 17:49.769
You ain't in first place,
you're in last place.

17:50.270 --> 17:50.570
(stopwatch beeps)

17:50.670 --> 17:52.139
(chuckles)

17:52.239 --> 17:53.506
Oh, Lavon.

17:53.606 --> 17:54.674
(clears throat)

17:54.774 --> 17:56.543
Have you met
my new runner?

17:56.643 --> 17:57.677
Dusty LeMaire.

17:58.678 --> 18:01.080
So named because he will
leave you in the dust.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.449
(chuckles)

18:04.351 --> 18:06.419
Go on, get back to
training now. Go on.

18:10.490 --> 18:13.193
Okay, I tried to make it
just like you described it.

18:13.293 --> 18:16.763
Black and white cookies
were just delivered.

18:16.863 --> 18:19.366
Tom Long painted some
weird art on the walls,

18:19.466 --> 18:20.700
and I got you
a crappy couch

18:20.800 --> 18:22.402
that is comfortable
enough to write on,

18:22.502 --> 18:24.237
but not too comfortable
that you'll fall asleep.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.805
I can't believe you went
through all the trouble.

18:25.905 --> 18:26.839
Oh, it was no trouble.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.175
Plus, Tom got to work through

18:29.176 --> 18:29.776
some of his anger
in the painting, you know.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.378
So it's a win-win.

18:31.478 --> 18:32.645
Ashtray.

18:32.745 --> 18:33.746
Do I smoke now?
No.

18:34.947 --> 18:36.183
Remember, you told me that
Luna smelled like stale smoke.

18:36.983 --> 18:37.684
By the way, you know
how hard it is

18:38.585 --> 18:39.319
to find someone
who smokes these days?

18:39.886 --> 18:41.154
Way to go, human beings.

18:42.222 --> 18:43.356
I'd ask you what you want,
but what's the point?

18:43.456 --> 18:45.425
We're all gonna die anyway.

18:47.527 --> 18:50.463
How did you know
there was a Goth waitress?

18:50.563 --> 18:52.399
There is always a Goth waitress.

18:52.499 --> 18:56.135
Okay, you write, and then
I'll check on you later.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.670
Oh, but be careful.

18:57.770 --> 18:59.539
There's a homeless guy

18:59.639 --> 19:00.807
eyeing your cookies.

19:00.907 --> 19:02.409
Good luck.

19:08.415 --> 19:10.917
It should be in there--
Carolee O'Connell, 10:00?

19:11.017 --> 19:12.452
I don't see
your name anywhere,

19:12.552 --> 19:14.454
but, oh, oh, could I offer you

19:14.554 --> 19:16.489
some rose petal jam
for your inconvenience?

19:16.589 --> 19:19.426
Well...
Mrs. O'Connell?

19:20.293 --> 19:22.695
Please. Carolee.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.897
Hi, Dr. Breeland.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.399
Oh, Brick.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.435
Wow, I haven't
seen you in ages,

19:28.535 --> 19:30.570
and may I say
you-you look wonderful.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.305
(chuckles)
It's all yoga.
Oh.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.573
It changed my life.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.843
And I finally got rid
of that ridiculous mole.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.511
Oh, I never noticed.

19:38.611 --> 19:40.447
Uh, what can I do
to help you?

19:40.547 --> 19:42.749
Well, Lemon and I ran
into each other yesterday,

19:42.849 --> 19:45.318
and she told me I was due
for some booster shots.

19:45.418 --> 19:46.786
She said to come in
this morning.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.389
Oh, she did, did she?

19:49.489 --> 19:52.359
Um, unfortunately,
you are completely booked up.

19:52.459 --> 19:54.327
Oh, uh, nonsense.

19:54.427 --> 19:55.728
Why, we always have time

19:55.828 --> 19:57.664
to see an old friend.

19:57.764 --> 19:59.432
Uh, this way.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.337
Stupid knee.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.307
I can't tell you
how sorry I am about this.

20:07.407 --> 20:09.476
What-what are you
apologizing for?

20:09.576 --> 20:11.611
It's not like you
did it on purpose.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.980
No, but I know how important
this race is to you.

20:14.080 --> 20:15.615
I didn't want to let you down.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.916
What?

20:17.016 --> 20:18.951
You could never let me down.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.753
That's the kind
of relationship we have.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.356
Look, there is nothing
that you could do

20:23.456 --> 20:26.259
or say that would ever make me
think less of you.

20:26.359 --> 20:28.428
Don't you know that?

20:31.631 --> 20:33.232
Lynly?

20:34.701 --> 20:38.338
Lavon, I have
to tell you something.

20:39.406 --> 20:42.642
(phone ringing)

20:42.742 --> 20:43.676
Oh, hey.

20:44.644 --> 20:45.512
LYNLY: I might have
made a teensy mistake

20:46.212 --> 20:47.514
and told Lavon we're together.

20:47.614 --> 20:48.481
Oops.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.383
I really hope you're kidding.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.251
Nope, so you might want make
a quick escape,

20:52.352 --> 20:53.586
because Lavon is
definitely headed your way.

20:53.686 --> 20:55.455
(pounding on door)
Tucker!

20:55.555 --> 20:56.956
Uh, he's here.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.591
I need to talk to you.

20:58.691 --> 21:00.026
Yeah, yeah.
(chuckles)

21:00.126 --> 21:02.462
I see you've heard
the great news!

21:02.562 --> 21:04.263
Oh, Lynly told me everything,

21:04.364 --> 21:05.532
including why
she can't run tomorrow.

21:05.632 --> 21:07.667
Oh, wow, she really went for it.
I can't believe

21:07.767 --> 21:09.369
I didn't hear it from you.
All that time,

21:09.469 --> 21:10.803
you looking me
in the eye and didn't tell me.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.706
Yeah, see, that is exactly
what I said, Lavon,

21:13.806 --> 21:15.508
but out of deference
to Lynly's wishes,

21:15.608 --> 21:17.844
I was... I was just waiting
for the right time.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.379
Oh, that's a crappy excuse.

21:19.479 --> 21:20.713
And this is a bad situation.

21:20.813 --> 21:22.515
Now, you know
she was vulnerable.

21:22.615 --> 21:23.950
And you said yourself,
you're damaged goods.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.284
That is true.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.619
That is very true.

21:27.887 --> 21:29.789
But I was completely up front
with Lynly about all of that,

21:29.889 --> 21:31.691
and she said

21:31.791 --> 21:35.061
she wanted to be there for me
while I healed.

21:35.161 --> 21:37.597
My cousin is nobody's Band-Aid.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.966
Now, you stop seeing Lynly...

21:40.066 --> 21:41.568
or you're out of the race.

21:41.668 --> 21:43.436
(chuckles)
Wait a minute.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.605
Are-are you giving me
an ultimatum?

21:47.440 --> 21:48.541
Just make your choice.

21:49.542 --> 21:52.479
You can't tell me
who I can and cannot see.

21:52.579 --> 21:54.881
You're fired from the team.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.816
What? Excuse-excuse me?

21:56.916 --> 21:57.984
No, you can't fire me,

21:58.084 --> 21:59.752
Lavon, 'cause I-I quit!

21:59.852 --> 22:02.355
(mutters)

22:04.724 --> 22:06.459
Hey, Joel.

22:06.559 --> 22:08.795
How you doing?
Did you get any writing done?

22:08.895 --> 22:12.999
Yeah, I, uh, wrote a list
of a hundred reasons why I suck,

22:13.099 --> 22:15.334
but I only got to 97.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.669
Look, I-I really do

22:16.769 --> 22:18.771
appreciate everything
that you have done,

22:18.871 --> 22:20.940
uh, but, um,
it's not working for me.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.842
So I'm just gonna call my agent

22:22.942 --> 22:24.911
and tell her
that I can't do this.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.613
Wh-What?

22:26.713 --> 22:27.714
No, no!

22:27.814 --> 22:28.881
Yeah, yeah.

22:29.849 --> 22:32.652
I'll just have her
get me a job writing menus,

22:32.752 --> 22:34.954
maybe fortune cookies,
or greeting cards.

22:35.054 --> 22:36.556
No, wait, those have to rhyme.

22:36.656 --> 22:38.057
Maybe I'll be a barber.

22:38.157 --> 22:39.459
Joel, writing novels,

22:39.559 --> 22:40.893
that is your dream, okay?
(sighs)

22:40.993 --> 22:44.363
Look, and your first book
has already sold

22:44.464 --> 22:45.598
over half a million copies.

22:45.698 --> 22:46.899
You were on the
short list

22:46.999 --> 22:48.501
for the National
Book Award.
(scoffs)

22:48.601 --> 22:49.836
Come on.
If it's not working here,

22:49.936 --> 22:51.370
then we'll just go
somewhere else.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.039
WADE: You can come
over to my place.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.607
Yeah, I get all sorts

22:54.707 --> 22:55.708
of great ideas over there.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.610
Breakfast for dinner. What?!

22:57.710 --> 22:59.011
Everyone thinks of that.

22:59.111 --> 22:59.946
Yeah, well, he can come over,

23:00.947 --> 23:01.648
play some video games
and blow off steam then.

23:02.248 --> 23:03.015
ZOE:
He has a deadline.

23:04.116 --> 23:04.651
Yeah, and reminding him
of that every five minutes

23:05.452 --> 23:05.752
isn't helping matters,
now is it?

23:06.686 --> 23:07.687
I'm sorry, but if you want
to do something,

23:07.787 --> 23:08.755
you don't blow off steam.

23:09.656 --> 23:10.523
You sit down
and you get it done, okay?

23:11.157 --> 23:11.624
And then when you finish,

23:12.559 --> 23:12.925
you can have fun
because you've earned it.

23:14.093 --> 23:14.927
Oh, wow. Thanks for the lesson
in creativity, Picasso.

23:15.828 --> 23:16.596
But you know,
when I'm writing songs,

23:17.730 --> 23:19.065
the best stuff comes to me
when I'm not even trying.

23:20.166 --> 23:21.634
Yeah, that's how all
the greatest events in history

23:21.734 --> 23:24.403
were accomplished:
by not even trying!

23:24.504 --> 23:25.738
Come on, Joel.
You know what?

23:25.838 --> 23:27.707
I want to give Wade's way a try.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.876
You know, just chill out
a little bit.

23:29.976 --> 23:30.710
I'm sorry.

23:31.343 --> 23:32.479
"Chill out"?
Yeah, buddy.

23:33.746 --> 23:34.914
Beer's in the fridge; you help
yourself to whatever you want.

23:35.014 --> 23:36.549
Thanks, man.

23:36.649 --> 23:37.650
All right, adios.

23:37.750 --> 23:40.553
Wha...?
I-I'm literally speechless.

23:40.653 --> 23:41.954
Well, you said
it was my fault.

23:42.054 --> 23:43.756
I'm just trying
to make it better.

23:43.856 --> 23:46.425
By what, giving him
every teenage boy's dream day?

23:46.526 --> 23:47.660
Well, maybe, maybe not.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.029
At least he'll have
a good time doing it.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.566
(sighs, gasps)

23:53.666 --> 23:55.101
Spare any change?

23:55.201 --> 23:56.603
Get a job!

24:05.845 --> 24:07.780
*

24:12.218 --> 24:14.554
(sighs)

24:16.889 --> 24:17.857
Joel?

24:17.957 --> 24:19.792
Joel!

24:24.030 --> 24:25.197
Well, well, well.

24:25.297 --> 24:27.199
Knew it was only
a matter of time before

24:27.299 --> 24:28.601
you came knocking
on my door again.

24:28.701 --> 24:29.602
Where's Joel?

24:29.702 --> 24:32.138
He's not here.
Which is probably a good thing,

24:32.238 --> 24:34.206
seeing as how desperate you are
to get into my house.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.508
Joel?! Joel?!

24:36.408 --> 24:37.510
I'm telling you
he's not here, all right?

24:37.610 --> 24:39.145
He-He was gone when I got in.

24:39.245 --> 24:40.813
Well, then where is he?

24:40.913 --> 24:43.750
I don't know. Maybe he hopped
a plane back to New York.

24:43.850 --> 24:45.184
Don't know why, though.

24:45.284 --> 24:46.586
Your roadhouse version
was so authentic.

24:46.686 --> 24:47.754
Really? That's it?

24:47.854 --> 24:51.524
I can't believe
my boyfriend is missing!

25:02.702 --> 25:04.203
I tried asking nicely,
and that didn't work.

25:04.303 --> 25:07.173
So now I'm demanding that
you tell me who bought Fancie's.

25:07.273 --> 25:08.575
I really wish you'd let this go.

25:08.675 --> 25:10.176
(chuckles):
Oh, well,

25:10.276 --> 25:12.111
sadly, that is not in my nature.

25:12.211 --> 25:13.780
So if you do not tell me,

25:13.880 --> 25:16.649
I will make one of your poor,
tired workers crack

25:16.749 --> 25:18.184
like a fine piece of china.

25:18.284 --> 25:19.586
Lemon...

25:19.686 --> 25:21.053
What is the problem?

25:21.153 --> 25:23.823
I promise, whoever the buyer is,
I can handle it!

25:23.923 --> 25:26.559
It's not you I'm worried about.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.137
(stopwatch beeping)

25:39.672 --> 25:40.907
(panting)

25:42.141 --> 25:44.310
I knew if I visualized being
on the team, it would happen.

25:44.410 --> 25:47.113
I should use this power
for good.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.782
I'm gonna to visualize a tree
that grows donuts.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.984
That's a terrible use
of a superpower.

25:52.084 --> 25:54.086
Obviously, you should visualize
a tree that grows money.

25:54.186 --> 25:55.321
Then you can buy whatever kind

25:55.421 --> 25:57.556
of food you want.
Genius.

25:57.657 --> 25:58.958
Meatball, 1:29.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.893
Wanda, 1:25.

26:00.993 --> 26:01.928
Wally, 1:22.

26:02.795 --> 26:03.696
Y'all want to get
your butts kicked?

26:03.796 --> 26:04.731
It seems like it.

26:04.831 --> 26:05.998
Look, not only did

26:07.133 --> 26:08.167
we lose our strongest runners,
Fillmore's got a ringer.

26:08.267 --> 26:09.769
Now, I need more from y'all!

26:10.837 --> 26:12.672
Where the hell's Crickett?

26:17.109 --> 26:18.277
She don't look so good.

26:18.377 --> 26:19.578
(stopwatch beeps)

26:19.679 --> 26:21.347
Crickett, you're one
minute slower

26:21.447 --> 26:23.082
than when you qualified.
What's going on?

26:23.182 --> 26:24.851
I don't know.

26:24.951 --> 26:27.086
It's really hot today.

26:27.186 --> 26:28.254
Uh-huh.

26:28.354 --> 26:30.089
Are you following the team diet?

26:30.189 --> 26:31.290
More or less.

26:31.390 --> 26:32.591
Which is it, more or less?

26:32.692 --> 26:34.861
I had a little jam.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.163
A lot of jam.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.098
Okay, I can't stop
eating it!

26:39.198 --> 26:40.599
At first,
I limited it

26:40.700 --> 26:41.768
to just toast.

26:42.835 --> 26:43.402
But then I wondered what else
I could put it on:

26:43.502 --> 26:46.272
pancakes, pretzels, cheese.

26:46.372 --> 26:48.274
That's right, cheese.

26:48.374 --> 26:50.943
I thought it would be
so disgusting that I'd stop.

26:51.043 --> 26:53.612
Turns out, jam on cheese
is delicious!

26:53.713 --> 26:55.748
Okay.

26:55.848 --> 26:57.616
Thank you for telling me.

26:57.717 --> 26:59.752
Everybody rest up.

26:59.852 --> 27:01.620
I'll see you at the race.

27:02.789 --> 27:05.958
Yo, you got any more
of that jam on cheese?

27:07.393 --> 27:09.829
GEORGE:
 I just...

27:09.929 --> 27:12.932
I just don't...
I just don't understand how

27:13.032 --> 27:15.768
out of all the possible times
to tell Lavon everything--

27:15.868 --> 27:18.037
and apparently,
you did tell him everything--

27:18.137 --> 27:20.940
why would you choose
now to do it?!

27:21.040 --> 27:24.176
I heard your stupid words in my
head, and suddenly I felt guilty

27:24.276 --> 27:26.779
looking him in the eye
and keeping it from him.

27:26.879 --> 27:28.314
Well, that's just perfect.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.817
Because now Lavon's mad at me
for lying. (chuckles)

27:30.917 --> 27:33.820
And now I'm off the team 'cause
I wouldn't stop seeing you.

27:33.920 --> 27:37.890
That is four months of
training just gone!

27:37.990 --> 27:41.327
That is endless hours
of strategizing just gone!

27:41.427 --> 27:44.731
That is BlueBell's chance
to win this whole thing--

27:44.831 --> 27:47.333
what is it, you guessed it--
yeah, gone!

27:47.433 --> 27:49.869
You quit the race because of me?

27:49.969 --> 27:51.771
Yeah. I mean,
what was I supposed to do?

27:51.871 --> 27:53.339
You like me.

27:53.439 --> 27:56.108
No! I mean, I do, yes.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.677
Yes, I do.
But that's not why...

27:58.778 --> 28:00.379
Look, I didn't pick you
because...

28:00.479 --> 28:02.081
Lavon is not the boss of me!

28:02.181 --> 28:06.085
I'm just saying you had a pretty
good reason to walk away.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.920
But here you are.

28:08.020 --> 28:10.289
You might not be as damaged
as you think.

28:10.389 --> 28:12.058
Hmm.

28:13.860 --> 28:16.462
Maybe we are in a relationship.

28:16.562 --> 28:18.765
(door opens)

28:22.869 --> 28:24.236
What's the matter?

28:24.336 --> 28:26.105
Yeah, I'll tell you
what's the matter.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.707
BlueBell's gonna lose the race,
and it's all your fault.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.843
How is it my fault?

28:30.943 --> 28:34.713
Because everything
was fine unt...

28:34.814 --> 28:35.948
until your jam came along.

28:36.048 --> 28:38.717
The runners were great,
best team I ever had.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.953
And then-then one day
out of nowhere,

28:41.053 --> 28:42.488
you put your jam out there.

28:42.588 --> 28:45.391
And now it's all
anyone can think about.

28:45.491 --> 28:47.426
Well, I'm sorry.

28:47.526 --> 28:48.861
I worked hard
on that jam.

28:49.996 --> 28:51.730
I wanted to share it,
take the jam to the next level.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.265
Because sometimes
people don't know

28:53.365 --> 28:56.268
they want jam unless you put it
in front of them.

28:56.368 --> 28:58.237
But you can't shove your jam
down people's throats.

28:58.337 --> 29:01.874
'Cause even if you like jam,
it makes you not want it!

29:01.974 --> 29:04.310
Well, maybe not,
but jam has an expiration.

29:04.410 --> 29:06.913
You can't just let it sit
on the shelf forever!

29:07.013 --> 29:11.283
So if you don't want my jam,
then you need to tell me

29:11.383 --> 29:13.219
so I can take it elsewhere.

29:19.525 --> 29:20.759
Jam.

29:21.727 --> 29:23.262
WADE:
 Hey, so, uh, I got good news,

29:23.362 --> 29:25.197
and I got some bad news.

29:25.297 --> 29:27.299
Good news is,
I know where Joel is.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.368
Thank God. Where?

29:29.468 --> 29:32.204
Well, that's what you might
consider the bad news.

29:32.304 --> 29:35.908
Uh, just try not to do
that whole overreacting thing

29:36.008 --> 29:37.776
you like to do.

29:37.877 --> 29:38.777
(clears throat)

29:38.878 --> 29:40.379
(gasps)

29:40.479 --> 29:41.447
Oh, my God! That's Joel!

29:42.514 --> 29:44.283
Where is he? And why
are his hands sort of tied?

29:44.383 --> 29:45.985
Read the next text.

29:46.085 --> 29:48.487
"We have your friend. Ha-ha-ha.
The Truitt Brothers."

29:48.587 --> 29:49.455
What is this?

29:49.555 --> 29:51.457
I guess you'd consider it
a ransom note.

29:51.557 --> 29:52.458
What?

29:53.459 --> 29:55.327
See, they owe me money,
and they're holding Joel

29:55.427 --> 29:58.230
until I let them off the hook.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.366
Wade Kinsella, you got
my boyfriend kidnapped.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.401
Yeah.

30:17.249 --> 30:19.886
All right, come on.
Come on, Crickett. Come on.

30:19.986 --> 30:21.353
Only 847 more to go.

30:21.453 --> 30:22.254
Come on.

30:22.989 --> 30:24.891
(grunts)
I don't feel so good.

30:24.991 --> 30:26.325
I think I'm going
through withdrawal.

30:26.425 --> 30:27.927
Jam withdrawal?

30:28.027 --> 30:30.529
I also gave up the coffee
I had with the jam.

30:30.629 --> 30:32.031
A lot of coffee.

30:32.131 --> 30:33.832
I can't feel my toes.

30:33.933 --> 30:35.868
Uh, problems with
your team there, Lavon?

30:35.968 --> 30:37.136
Butt out, Gainey.

30:37.236 --> 30:39.371
You get DQ'd
you don't have four runners.

30:39.471 --> 30:40.372
We have four runners.

30:41.540 --> 30:43.976
Mm. Man, I knew I should have
left the trophy in my case.

30:44.076 --> 30:46.112
(both chuckle)

30:48.380 --> 30:49.848
We're screwed.

30:49.949 --> 30:52.384
I did not come this far
to give up now.

30:58.524 --> 31:00.426
LYNLY:
Oh, that's not good.

31:00.526 --> 31:01.460
What's not good?

31:01.560 --> 31:02.861
Dusty LeMaire.

31:02.962 --> 31:04.130
I remember him
from school.

31:04.230 --> 31:06.966
He made state all
six years of college.

31:07.066 --> 31:08.267
Six years?

31:08.367 --> 31:10.102
God doesn't give
with both hands.

31:10.202 --> 31:12.371
So Gainey brought in
a ringer, huh?

31:12.471 --> 31:14.006
Lavon must be dying.

31:17.543 --> 31:19.011
You know what?

31:19.111 --> 31:21.113
I'll be right back.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.385
Lavon, you got a second?

31:29.588 --> 31:32.959
Look, Lynly and I,
we're not going away.

31:33.059 --> 31:35.427
So you can either
bury your head in the sand

31:35.527 --> 31:38.264
and try and act like
the situation doesn't exist,

31:38.364 --> 31:42.601
like you're doing with AnnaBeth
and this... ultimatum,

31:42.701 --> 31:47.073
or you can grow up
and you can accept it.

31:48.307 --> 31:49.475
All right, hello, everybody!
Hello!

31:50.609 --> 31:53.212
Welcome to the Mobile Bay
Cross-Country Relay Race.

31:53.312 --> 31:56.148
Now if I can just have
all the runners step up

31:56.248 --> 31:57.416
to the starting line, please.

31:57.516 --> 32:00.352
Everybody who's running,
come on now.

32:01.653 --> 32:03.355
(chuckles)

32:03.455 --> 32:04.456
ALL:
BlueBell!

32:05.557 --> 32:08.494
What's it gonna be, Lavon?

32:10.462 --> 32:13.332
All right, on your marks.

32:13.432 --> 32:14.967
Get set.

32:15.067 --> 32:16.535
(gunshot)

32:16.635 --> 32:19.538
(crowd cheering)

32:19.638 --> 32:21.873
Go, Wally, go! Go, boy!

32:25.744 --> 32:27.079
Come on now!

32:32.218 --> 32:35.354
All right, Wanda,
you never ran so fast! (laughs)

32:44.630 --> 32:45.497
Go, Crickett, go!

32:48.734 --> 32:51.503
*

33:08.420 --> 33:10.122
WOMAN:
Wait, there he is!

33:10.222 --> 33:13.159
(crowd cheering, clamoring)

33:20.066 --> 33:22.034
(crowd cheering)

33:30.709 --> 33:32.711
CROWD (chanting):
BlueBell! BlueBell! BlueBell!

33:32.811 --> 33:34.413
(chanting continues)

33:36.215 --> 33:37.449
Don't get cocky.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.052
She's gonna be coming back
home to Fillmore next year.

33:40.152 --> 33:42.421
In your dreams.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.523
(laughs)

33:44.623 --> 33:47.193
(crowd cheering)

34:06.212 --> 34:07.646
(door opens)

34:07.746 --> 34:09.081
Oh, Lemonade.

34:10.349 --> 34:12.184
I was, uh, just getting ready
to head out and pick up Carolee.

34:12.284 --> 34:15.254
We are having
cocktails and dinner.

34:15.353 --> 34:16.722
She wanted to do both.

34:16.822 --> 34:17.755
That's nice, Daddy, but...

34:17.856 --> 34:19.158
And I need to thank you.

34:19.257 --> 34:20.792
You were absolutely
right about her.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.060
She is lovely.

34:22.161 --> 34:23.495
I don't even mind
you sneaking

34:23.594 --> 34:26.063
behind my back and telling
her to come see me.

34:26.165 --> 34:27.333
Thank you, Daddy, but...

34:27.433 --> 34:29.435
And I was letting the
past hold me back.

34:29.534 --> 34:33.071
But no more. I am now
ready to move forward.

34:33.172 --> 34:34.306
Okay, well,
before you start moving,

34:35.341 --> 34:36.574
there is something
that I really need to show you.

34:40.846 --> 34:43.315
(grunts)

34:43.415 --> 34:45.451
Well, personally, I don't blame
Joel for running away.

34:45.551 --> 34:47.485
He didn't run away,
he was kidnapped.

34:47.585 --> 34:49.087
Yeah, you're doing
the same thing to him

34:49.188 --> 34:50.356
that you did with me
and my music.

34:50.456 --> 34:51.357
Pushing, pushing, pushing.

34:51.456 --> 34:52.690
No, it's the exact opposite.

34:52.791 --> 34:53.792
Your band sucked.

34:53.891 --> 34:55.161
Hmm.

34:56.895 --> 34:59.097
Joel's a genius!

34:59.198 --> 35:01.367
(brush rustling)
(hawk screeches)

35:01.467 --> 35:02.334
Wait!

35:03.202 --> 35:03.602
I don't know what
you're so mad about.

35:04.736 --> 35:05.504
I'm just trying to help you
be a better girlfriend.

35:06.438 --> 35:07.339
Oh, relationship advice
from Wade Kinsella?

35:08.106 --> 35:08.540
Joel was right,
you are hilarious.

35:09.341 --> 35:09.741
I know what's
really going on here.

35:09.841 --> 35:11.310
Oh, this again.

35:12.378 --> 35:12.878
Did you actually come up
with something this time?

35:13.512 --> 35:14.213
Yeah, you're sabotaging Joel

35:15.214 --> 35:15.747
because you think
once he's out of the picture,

35:16.282 --> 35:17.216
I'll come back to you.

35:18.150 --> 35:18.517
Sweetheart, I don't have
to send Joel away

35:19.251 --> 35:19.885
for you to come
back to me.

35:20.652 --> 35:21.153
We all know
the real reason is

35:22.020 --> 35:22.053
that you don't want
me telling Joel

35:22.854 --> 35:23.622
that you're still
in love with me.

35:24.823 --> 35:25.424
You're delusional!
Don't worry, it's
our little secret.

35:26.225 --> 35:26.858
Okay, look,
as a doctor, seriously,

35:27.393 --> 35:28.126
you need medical help.

35:28.594 --> 35:29.561
WADE:
All right.

35:30.696 --> 35:31.830
Before we do this thing,
I got to ask you one question.

35:31.930 --> 35:32.664
What?

35:32.764 --> 35:34.500
You sure you want
to rescue him?

35:34.600 --> 35:36.535
I mean...

35:36.635 --> 35:38.737
Ow.
(groans)

35:38.837 --> 35:40.272
Truitt Brothers!

35:40.372 --> 35:43.275
We know you have Joel!
We want proof of life!

35:43.375 --> 35:45.143
What are you doing?

35:45.244 --> 35:47.413
I've seen movies.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.691
We'll return Jo-el--
if that's his real name--

35:59.791 --> 36:01.460
when you forgive our debt.

36:01.560 --> 36:02.461
(scoffs)

36:02.561 --> 36:03.762
Tell them you'll negotiate.

36:03.862 --> 36:05.631
I will not negotiate!

36:05.731 --> 36:06.832
(whispers):
Do it!

36:06.932 --> 36:08.467
I'm not enjoying
the hitting.

36:08.567 --> 36:09.501
(sighs)

36:09.601 --> 36:11.770
I know that you owe Wade money.

36:11.870 --> 36:14.706
But if you don't
have money,

36:14.806 --> 36:17.576
maybe you can offer
something else in trade.

36:17.676 --> 36:18.810
Yeah.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.412
Jo-el.

36:21.313 --> 36:23.582
Maybe you can work it off.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.717
What can you do?

36:25.817 --> 36:29.187
Well... uh...

36:29.288 --> 36:30.922
Not a lot, actually.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.858
ZOE:
Okay.

36:32.958 --> 36:35.294
Wade, you are apparently

36:35.394 --> 36:37.296
terrible at collecting
bar tabs.

36:37.396 --> 36:38.797
That's not true.
(scoffs)

36:38.897 --> 36:39.631
Truitt Brothers,

36:40.466 --> 36:42.334
you are fairly good
at scaring people.

36:42.434 --> 36:44.770
So, what if you worked
off your debt

36:44.870 --> 36:48.807
by helping Wade
collect other people's debt.

36:48.907 --> 36:51.510
That's not the worst
idea you've ever had.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.345
I always dreamed
of being a heavy.

36:53.445 --> 36:54.946
Never thought
it could actually happen.

36:55.046 --> 36:57.349
We accept your terms.

36:57.449 --> 36:58.817
We're releasing the hostage.

36:58.917 --> 37:01.353
Oh, my God.

37:02.288 --> 37:03.655
Uh, we also want you

37:03.755 --> 37:07.493
to-to name a dish after us
at your bar.

37:07.593 --> 37:09.461
No.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.398
I knew I should've
said that sooner.

37:12.498 --> 37:13.932
Hey!

37:14.032 --> 37:15.767
Hey, hey.

37:15.867 --> 37:16.602
Hi.

37:17.336 --> 37:18.604
God, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

37:19.571 --> 37:20.939
Look, I've had training in PTSD,
so I can help.

37:21.039 --> 37:22.508
Oh, no, no, no.
Are you kidding me?

37:23.709 --> 37:24.776
This is the most amazing thing
I've ever done in my life!

37:24.876 --> 37:25.877
Really?
Well, yeah!

37:26.845 --> 37:27.879
I had no idea
that people lived like this.

37:29.080 --> 37:29.981
You know, we had spray cheese
and moonshine for breakfast.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.484
And I swear to God,
the raccoons in there,

37:32.584 --> 37:34.553
they outnumber the people.
Where's my computer?

37:34.653 --> 37:36.254
I got to get all this down.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.789
Bye, guys!

37:37.889 --> 37:39.525
Chicken!

37:39.625 --> 37:41.660
(clucks)
Okay, Jo-el.

37:41.760 --> 37:42.861
(laughs)

37:42.961 --> 37:44.630
Happy trails.

37:47.666 --> 37:50.369
So, thanks
for coming over.

37:50.469 --> 37:54.272
I've been trying to
for days.

37:54.373 --> 37:56.508
Look, I wish I didn't say
what I said,

37:56.608 --> 37:58.344
but it's out there now.

37:58.444 --> 38:01.980
And avoiding me
doesn't change that.

38:02.080 --> 38:03.549
Yeah.

38:03.649 --> 38:04.750
I've been reacting badly.

38:04.850 --> 38:08.687
But I got burned when I rushed
into proposing to Ruby.

38:08.787 --> 38:11.857
And then the whole Lemon thing--
that's a mess all its own.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.427
So I don't want
to rush this time.

38:15.527 --> 38:18.296
I understand that. I do.

38:18.397 --> 38:19.731
And I don't want you to rush.

38:19.831 --> 38:22.768
But it's hard for me
to be in limbo, you know?

38:22.868 --> 38:24.903
Yeah, I do.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.004
I do.

38:26.104 --> 38:29.007
That's why...

38:29.107 --> 38:31.009
I cleared out a space
for your jamming.

38:31.109 --> 38:32.611
I mean, I know
how important it is to you.

38:33.845 --> 38:35.547
So that way, you can use it for
your-your jars and your labels

38:35.647 --> 38:37.583
and your... pectin?

38:37.683 --> 38:41.052
Yeah, I don't really understand
the whole jam-making process.

38:41.152 --> 38:43.321
But the point is,
we're moving forward.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.991
Just... slowly.

38:46.091 --> 38:47.993
Thank you.

38:48.093 --> 38:49.961
But to be honest,

38:50.061 --> 38:52.531
I don't think I'll be

38:52.631 --> 38:55.701
making quite as
much jam anymore.

38:58.069 --> 38:59.004
Hmm?

38:59.104 --> 39:00.672
Hmm?

39:00.772 --> 39:03.842
* We're flying,
 we're flying high *

39:03.942 --> 39:05.010
(country music playing)

39:05.110 --> 39:06.445
* Darling, you look beautiful

39:06.545 --> 39:09.615
* Just flying

39:09.715 --> 39:12.484
* Your hand in mine

39:12.584 --> 39:15.387
* Won't you come
with me tonight? *

39:21.593 --> 39:23.562
* I want to go down...

39:23.662 --> 39:24.496
Hey.

39:24.596 --> 39:25.564
Looks like Joel's

39:25.664 --> 39:27.799
writer's block
is finally broken.

39:27.899 --> 39:29.801
Yeah, he's hardly looked
up for two hours.

39:29.901 --> 39:32.370
Not even when Busty Sally
dropped her pen.

39:32.471 --> 39:35.507
Hmm, so I guess
he didn't need to relax.

39:35.607 --> 39:37.042
And he didn't need
to work through it.

39:37.142 --> 39:39.044
He just needed
a grand adventure.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.111
We were both wrong.

39:40.211 --> 39:41.880
Apology accepted.

39:41.980 --> 39:42.948
Wait, what?

39:43.048 --> 39:44.716
That was not an apology!

39:44.816 --> 39:47.419
* You look beautiful
just flying... *

39:47.519 --> 39:49.087
It feels good to
be a winner.

39:49.187 --> 39:50.522
(chuckles)

39:52.458 --> 39:54.025
Are you sure about that?

39:54.125 --> 39:56.394
I don't have anything to hide.

39:59.765 --> 40:02.133
Hey!

40:02.233 --> 40:04.503
You two are...?

40:04.603 --> 40:07.906
With the kissing
and the hands...?

40:08.006 --> 40:09.107
Did we know about this?

40:09.207 --> 40:10.676
Yup.

40:14.513 --> 40:15.681
Oh.

40:15.781 --> 40:17.649
(exhales)

40:17.749 --> 40:19.851
It's a start.
(chuckles)

40:20.952 --> 40:22.588
(clears throat)

40:23.589 --> 40:24.956
Hey.
Hi.

40:25.056 --> 40:27.559
I don't mean to interrupt,
but how's it going?

40:27.659 --> 40:29.094
I have never written
anything so fast.

40:29.194 --> 40:30.161
My fingers are
literally burning.

40:30.261 --> 40:32.430
So, good?

40:32.531 --> 40:33.965
Yeah, I don't mean
to jinx anything,

40:34.065 --> 40:35.501
but I actually like
what I'm writing.

40:35.601 --> 40:36.968
And by the way,
in case I haven't said it,

40:37.068 --> 40:39.104
there is no way that I could've
gotten through all this

40:39.204 --> 40:40.105
without your support.

40:40.205 --> 40:40.939
Are you sure?

40:41.573 --> 40:41.873
'Cause there's a fine line

40:42.741 --> 40:43.441
between being pushy
and supportive.

40:44.242 --> 40:44.876
And apparently
most of the time,

40:45.744 --> 40:47.078
I can come down
on the wrong side of it.

40:47.178 --> 40:48.980
You're a doctor.
You fix things.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.982
I love that about you.
Well, you are an artist.

40:51.082 --> 40:53.819
And I need to let you have
your own process.

40:53.919 --> 40:55.987
You know, I can't keep
browbeating you into mine.

40:56.087 --> 40:57.789
Hey, dude, you want
to come over tomorrow night?

40:57.889 --> 40:58.924
I got, uh, Motorbike Mayhem 4.

40:59.925 --> 41:00.792
It's supposed to have
way more mayhem than 3.

41:01.660 --> 41:02.594
Actually, I promised
the Truitt Brothers

41:03.228 --> 41:03.795
that we'd go skeet shooting.

41:05.531 --> 41:06.832
Mayhem and skeet shooting?

41:08.066 --> 41:09.467
Don't you think it'd be smarter
to keep the momentum going,

41:10.401 --> 41:11.002
and start on chapters
four through six?

41:12.137 --> 41:14.205
That was pushy, wasn't it?

41:14.305 --> 41:15.941
Oh, yeah.
Little bit.

41:16.041 --> 41:17.475
* Flying

41:17.576 --> 41:19.678
* We're flying high. *

41:19.778 --> 41:21.913
(hammers banging nearby)

41:22.013 --> 41:25.784
SHELBY: I don't want the sequins
getting all dusty.

41:25.884 --> 41:28.486
And, Ramon, we have got to do
something about this floor.

41:28.587 --> 41:30.155
It is all slanted.

41:30.255 --> 41:31.857
Look, I'm, like, lopsided.

41:31.957 --> 41:34.960
Uh, I'm just gonna slide
right into the crowd.

41:35.060 --> 41:35.994
So, just to confirm,

41:36.928 --> 41:37.896
that is the woman
that you were engaged to,

41:38.697 --> 41:40.098
and the one
that you broke up with?

41:40.198 --> 41:41.166
Uh-huh.

41:41.266 --> 41:43.034
Is this thing on?

41:43.134 --> 41:44.135
(hums)

41:44.235 --> 41:45.604
How long ago was that?

41:45.704 --> 41:49.174
Uh... uh, six--
s-seven months.

41:49.274 --> 41:52.043
(singsongy):
Don't put that box over there.

41:52.143 --> 41:55.013
Well, I'm not the doctor here,
but that looks about right.

41:55.113 --> 41:56.114
These acoustics suck.

41:56.214 --> 41:57.783
But you're so cute!

41:57.883 --> 41:59.084
Oh, my Lord.
