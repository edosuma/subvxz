01:25.000 --> 01:26.083
Come on, everyone.

01:26.875 --> 01:28.250
What did you steal?

01:28.333 --> 01:30.875
-I got a sugar cube.
-I got a biscuit crumb.

01:32.125 --> 01:33.541
-I got a toenail.
-Oops.

01:33.625 --> 01:34.458
-Dad?
-Yes?

01:34.541 --> 01:37.291
On the next sneak,
can we break into the house with the…

01:37.375 --> 01:38.583
What's that?

01:40.083 --> 01:41.083
Oh, it's a…

01:42.875 --> 01:44.333
Inside! Now!

01:56.416 --> 01:58.458
It's a… It's…

01:58.541 --> 02:00.541
Funny-looking. Can we eat it?

02:00.625 --> 02:01.875
No! It's a…

02:03.083 --> 02:04.791
Well, it's a robin, I think.

02:04.875 --> 02:05.875
Hi, Robin.

02:07.416 --> 02:08.666
Can we keep her?

02:09.750 --> 02:11.541
Well, maybe.

02:12.791 --> 02:14.958
After all, she's only one little…

02:17.500 --> 02:18.333
robin.

02:42.125 --> 02:42.958
Wait.

02:44.833 --> 02:45.833
Wait for it.

02:48.291 --> 02:49.666
Okay, let's go slowly--

02:49.750 --> 02:51.041
-Yes!
-Hey!

02:54.958 --> 02:58.791
<i>We're on our way to break into a house</i>

02:58.875 --> 03:02.666
<i>Might be a bird</i>
<i>But I sneak just like a mouse</i>

03:15.250 --> 03:18.500
-So, what are you getting tonight?
-I might get a pie crumb?

03:18.583 --> 03:21.833
-Something moldy, I think.
-Well, I'm gonna sneak a whole crust.

03:22.458 --> 03:26.791
Well, I'm going to sneak
a whole sandwich. Yes.

03:26.875 --> 03:29.750
-You can't sneak a whole sandwich.
-How do you sneak a sandwich?

03:33.333 --> 03:34.166
Like this.

03:36.666 --> 03:38.000
Race you to the fence!

03:39.541 --> 03:40.916
That's in my eye!

03:41.000 --> 03:41.958
Don't do that.

03:42.916 --> 03:44.375
-Pip, you're up front.
-Yes, Dad.

03:44.458 --> 03:46.000
-Dink, don't drag your tail.
-Okay.

03:46.083 --> 03:48.000
-Flynn, Flin, no showing off.
-All right.

03:48.083 --> 03:48.916
And, Robin…

03:50.458 --> 03:51.500
Got it, Dad!

03:52.458 --> 03:53.875
I didn't say anything.

03:53.958 --> 03:54.791
Robin!

03:55.958 --> 03:56.791
Robin?

04:08.708 --> 04:10.791
<i>The rules of the sneak are simple and thus</i>

04:10.875 --> 04:12.791
<i>Follow them close</i>
<i>You could steal a crust</i>

04:12.875 --> 04:14.833
<i>-Or a crumpet rind</i>
<i>-Or a pinch of pie</i>

04:14.916 --> 04:17.708
<i>Or the grease from the tip</i>
<i>Of a soggy french fry</i>

04:18.375 --> 04:20.333
<i>Crumbs and crusts and stale bread</i>

04:20.416 --> 04:22.458
<i>Soggy flakes and bin dregs</i>

04:22.541 --> 04:27.208
<i>Any old leftovers</i>
<i>We'll sneak home with us</i>

04:27.291 --> 04:29.791
<i>First find a secret entrance</i>

04:29.875 --> 04:31.750
<i>Keep your eyes open wide</i>

04:31.833 --> 04:32.833
<i>-For a hole</i>
<i>-Or a crack</i>

04:32.916 --> 04:36.166
<i>-Or a window with a gap</i>
<i>-Just enough to squeeze inside</i>

04:38.375 --> 04:42.583
<i>Once we're in, we creep around</i>
<i>Tiptoe past without a sound</i>

04:42.666 --> 04:44.750
<i>Keep to the shadows</i>
<i>Don't get heard</i>

04:44.833 --> 04:47.333
<i>Whisper every single word</i>

04:49.416 --> 04:50.583
-What?
-Come on.

04:52.250 --> 04:56.416
<i>Last, the most important</i>
<i>Remember in the who-man place</i>

04:56.500 --> 04:58.750
<i>They're choosy who's invited</i>

04:58.833 --> 05:03.291
<i>So we must never leave a trace</i>

05:03.375 --> 05:07.458
<i>Crumbs and crusts and stale bread</i>
<i>Soggy flakes and bin dregs</i>

05:07.541 --> 05:11.750
<i>Any old leftovers</i>
<i>We'll sneak home with us</i>

05:14.166 --> 05:15.875
A whole sandwich!

05:16.958 --> 05:21.250
<i>When we're done, we disappear</i>
<i>Nobody knows that we were here</i>

05:22.000 --> 05:24.291
<i>-With crumbs in our hands</i>
<i>-And warmth in our hearts</i>

05:24.375 --> 05:26.833
<i>And the sludge from the tin</i>
<i>Of a moldy jam tart</i>

05:29.541 --> 05:30.750
<i>-Don't make a sound</i>
-Robin!

05:30.833 --> 05:31.833
<i>Don't leave a trace</i>

05:31.916 --> 05:33.708
<i>Keep to the shadows</i>
<i>Take what we need</i>

05:33.791 --> 05:40.166
<i>The rules of the sneak are these</i>

05:46.250 --> 05:47.250
Who-mans!

06:03.625 --> 06:04.458
Robin!

06:09.208 --> 06:12.291
Well, let's not go back there again.

06:13.500 --> 06:18.541
They'll be setting out traps
or maybe even getting a kitten.

06:18.625 --> 06:19.583
Kittens!

06:20.166 --> 06:21.416
Don't listen to them.

06:23.541 --> 06:25.375
-Nice one, Robin.
-What?

06:25.458 --> 06:28.125
Well, the spoon, and the sandwich, and--

06:28.208 --> 06:29.750
Pip, enough of that.

06:29.833 --> 06:31.875
Come on. We've still got plenty to eat.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.625
There's the bag of Earl Grey.

06:34.916 --> 06:37.250
I'm sick of Earl Grey!

06:42.125 --> 06:45.166
All right. Well, come on now. Off to bed.

06:47.125 --> 06:49.416
It's okay, Robin.
We'll figure this out together.

06:49.500 --> 06:52.541
Yeah. I mean, next time, I'll just…

06:53.291 --> 06:57.166
Stay away from spoons. Yeah.

07:03.416 --> 07:05.375
All that mold!

07:16.416 --> 07:17.791
Sandwich…

07:35.875 --> 07:37.875
"Hi, Robin. What's all this?"

07:37.958 --> 07:40.250
"Crumbs? For the whole family?"

07:41.291 --> 07:44.583
"Yeah. It was easy.
Just got them from a who-man house."

07:45.375 --> 07:50.250
"Oh, wow, Robin!
You're the most amazing sneak ever!"

07:54.333 --> 07:56.208
Can't wait to see the look on Pip's face

07:56.291 --> 07:59.250
when I come back
with a crumb the size of his head.

08:06.333 --> 08:10.041
No. No. No. No.

08:10.125 --> 08:11.708
Oh, excuse me.

08:11.791 --> 08:14.458
-Do you know where the--
-No.

08:15.708 --> 08:17.375
Okay. Thanks anyway.

08:20.916 --> 08:22.458
The who-man house.

08:41.958 --> 08:44.500
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize this was a…

08:47.208 --> 08:48.458
cat house!

08:50.333 --> 08:51.625
No. No.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.958
Now, that's a yes!

08:55.041 --> 08:55.875
Cat!

08:58.875 --> 08:59.708
Oh dear.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.791
Silly bird, fly!

09:03.875 --> 09:04.916
What? Wait!

09:12.583 --> 09:13.916
Why aren't you flying?

09:15.333 --> 09:16.583
I can't fly.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.375
Why aren't <i>you</i> flying?

09:21.458 --> 09:24.958
-Well, I've got a broken wing!
-Oh no. How did that happen?

09:27.500 --> 09:29.958
Magpie? Wait for me!

09:36.250 --> 09:39.875
-Let's get you safe indoors, hey?
-Thanks. Is the cat still--

09:40.375 --> 09:41.833
Poor little thing.

09:47.750 --> 09:48.875
Oh, awful!

09:48.958 --> 09:50.750
Out there all by yourself--

09:55.333 --> 09:58.791
-Are we safe in here?
-Yes. We're safe.

09:58.875 --> 10:01.708
The thorns keep unwanted visitors out.

10:02.583 --> 10:03.750
Usually.

10:03.833 --> 10:04.958
Oh, good.

10:05.708 --> 10:07.666
Is this your house?

10:07.750 --> 10:10.333
It's very…

10:12.041 --> 10:15.291
Why, thank you. I suppose it is rather…

10:16.583 --> 10:17.416
Perfect.

10:18.041 --> 10:18.958
Well…

10:20.708 --> 10:22.291
A who-man house.

10:23.875 --> 10:25.791
Bet they've got loads of crumbs in there.

10:26.625 --> 10:28.083
Them. Yes.

10:28.583 --> 10:30.708
They've got loads of everything.

10:32.291 --> 10:36.583
And all because of that
magic shiny wishing star, eh?

10:37.291 --> 10:38.416
Yeah.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.541
The magic shiny…

10:41.208 --> 10:42.708
Wait. Sorry, what?

10:42.791 --> 10:43.625
The star.

10:44.250 --> 10:45.083
You don't…

10:46.166 --> 10:47.000
Right!

10:47.541 --> 10:49.583
Okay. It must be here somewhere.

10:51.708 --> 10:57.291
Once a year, the who-mans
take the spikiest tree in the woods,

10:57.375 --> 10:59.750
cover it in tin-soil and boo-bells,

10:59.833 --> 11:04.166
until their tree
is all twinkling and beautiful.

11:04.250 --> 11:05.166
Just like mine.

11:08.541 --> 11:14.833
Then, they put a shiny magic star on top,
make a wish,

11:14.916 --> 11:19.375
and in the morning,
they get anything they want.

11:20.458 --> 11:21.291
Like crumbs.

11:22.166 --> 11:23.000
Crumbs?

11:23.625 --> 11:25.000
Don't be absurd.

11:25.583 --> 11:27.916
Well, what could be better than crumbs?

11:28.416 --> 11:30.208
"What could be better than…"

11:30.291 --> 11:32.458
Things!

11:37.375 --> 11:40.166
<i>Things, they make you happy</i>

11:40.666 --> 11:43.166
<i>Things won't fly away</i>

11:43.750 --> 11:46.500
<i>Things will stick with you till the end</i>

11:46.583 --> 11:51.083
<i>Oh yes, on things you can depend</i>

11:52.166 --> 11:55.208
<i>See my bathtub? It's designer</i>

11:55.291 --> 11:56.916
<i>Finest china! Well, kinda</i>

11:57.000 --> 12:00.916
<i>Simply must have the latest bottle top</i>
<i>I love it so, I'll never stop</i>

12:01.000 --> 12:02.750
<i>This chair? Hedgehog hair</i>

12:02.833 --> 12:04.416
<i>Pamperclips? I've got the pair</i>

12:04.500 --> 12:08.333
<i>This is a limited-edition piece of string</i>

12:09.416 --> 12:13.958
<i>I was a bird who couldn't fly</i>
<i>Felt tiny while they flew up high</i>

12:14.625 --> 12:17.625
<i>Surrounded myself with things so gorgeous</i>

12:17.708 --> 12:19.750
<i>Felt enormous!</i>

12:19.833 --> 12:21.500
<i>So afraid and alone</i>

12:21.583 --> 12:24.125
<i>Things turn a hovel to a home</i>

12:24.208 --> 12:27.500
<i>Got no personality?</i>
<i>I let my lampshade speak for me</i>

12:27.583 --> 12:31.916
<i>Hollow inside? You're not enough?</i>
<i>Just stuff that hole with lovely stuff</i>

12:32.000 --> 12:36.083
<i>Things are things that make you happy</i>
<i>Who needs friends? I've got a shoe chair</i>

12:36.166 --> 12:40.708
<i>No one there for you to care for?</i>
<i>Polish up your silverware for?</i>

12:40.791 --> 12:47.791
<i>There's no better company than one penny</i>

12:56.333 --> 12:59.875
Look, my point is,
wish for something far better than crumbs.

13:03.375 --> 13:04.500
Right.

13:05.541 --> 13:07.416
Better than crumbs?

13:14.416 --> 13:17.250
Like a whole sandwich!

13:17.833 --> 13:18.708
Never mind.

13:19.416 --> 13:20.250
Okay, then.

13:20.833 --> 13:21.791
I'll do it.

13:21.875 --> 13:23.791
-Do what?
-I'll go get the star.

13:23.875 --> 13:27.416
Impossible! It's inside the who-man house.

13:28.583 --> 13:31.625
Maybe I forgot to mention?
I was raised by mice.

13:31.708 --> 13:32.791
Explains the ears.

13:32.875 --> 13:36.833
And if there's one thing
us mice are good at, it's sneaking.

13:39.416 --> 13:40.250
Sorry, what?

13:40.333 --> 13:42.416
Oh, like, into houses.

13:43.458 --> 13:46.250
To get stuff. Like, stealing it.

13:46.958 --> 13:47.791
Right.

13:49.375 --> 13:52.916
Right!

13:53.000 --> 13:54.500
Show me.

14:01.625 --> 14:03.000
Okay. I'm in.

14:04.875 --> 14:07.750
What are you doing?
You're supposed to wait outside.

14:07.833 --> 14:09.916
-I thought that we were--
-Who-mans!

14:27.833 --> 14:28.833
Okay.

14:29.833 --> 14:33.625
We're going to have to be
the sneakiest mice we've ever been.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.208
I'm not a mouse.

14:37.875 --> 14:40.208
Just do exactly what I do.

15:30.208 --> 15:32.833
What are you doing?
You'll wake the who-mans.

15:32.916 --> 15:34.833
I'm being a sneaky mouse.

15:34.916 --> 15:36.458
That's not sneaking.

15:36.541 --> 15:38.208
The whole point of being a mouse

15:38.291 --> 15:40.916
is that you don't draw attention
to yourself.

15:46.625 --> 15:47.708
Careful.

15:49.791 --> 15:52.416
Careful.

15:54.750 --> 15:55.583
Got it!

15:59.916 --> 16:00.833
Who-mans!

16:08.125 --> 16:10.750
Not bad for a couple
of flightless fools, eh?

16:12.458 --> 16:13.958
Why is it you don't fly?

16:14.875 --> 16:17.500
I just never learned.
I mean, mice don't fly.

16:21.333 --> 16:23.291
Well, it's easy! You just flap!

16:23.375 --> 16:25.625
No, thanks. I'll just…

16:27.958 --> 16:28.791
All right!

16:33.625 --> 16:35.333
Oh, you're a natural!

16:58.708 --> 16:59.541
Oh dear.

17:08.541 --> 17:09.375
The star!

17:18.666 --> 17:22.375
Perfect.

17:31.083 --> 17:31.916
Hello.

17:35.541 --> 17:37.125
What's this?

17:37.916 --> 17:39.916
An unexpected visitor.

17:42.291 --> 17:43.125
Why…

17:44.666 --> 17:49.500
it's the little bird
who sneaks about on the floor like a…

17:50.708 --> 17:51.916
mouse?

17:54.250 --> 17:56.708
And who are you trying to fool
with those…

17:57.750 --> 17:59.541
funny things?

18:02.458 --> 18:04.708
-My family are mice, so…
-Mice?

18:05.708 --> 18:07.500
Oh, and the ears are…

18:10.166 --> 18:11.583
Oh, I see.

18:12.333 --> 18:15.250
So tragic. So sad.

18:15.333 --> 18:17.750
Trying to fit in.

18:19.083 --> 18:21.333
You know you'll never be a real mouse.

18:22.125 --> 18:23.000
Oh, no, I…

18:24.500 --> 18:25.416
You see,

18:25.500 --> 18:26.916
you're a misfit.

18:27.583 --> 18:28.750
You're an oddball.

18:29.250 --> 18:30.625
You're a freak.

18:30.708 --> 18:32.000
No, I'm not.

18:32.083 --> 18:34.541
<i>Micey ears atop a birdy beak</i>

18:34.625 --> 18:35.541
Well, yeah.

18:35.625 --> 18:39.666
<i>But I've never seen a bird</i>
<i>So peculiar, so absurd</i>

18:39.750 --> 18:44.375
<i>How about we play a game</i>
<i>Of hide-and-seek, if you can?</i>

18:45.208 --> 18:48.416
<i>As a mouse, to me</i>
<i>You seem to be just terrible</i>

18:49.000 --> 18:52.875
<i>Fitting in is more</i>
<i>Than dress-up and pretend</i>

18:52.958 --> 18:57.125
<i>If it's fitting in you're desperate for</i>
<i>Come down, search no more</i>

18:57.208 --> 19:00.041
<i>I know the perfect place</i>
<i>For you, my friend</i>

19:00.125 --> 19:03.500
<i>For you, I've the perfect place</i>

19:04.250 --> 19:07.375
<i>Not picky, stick with me</i>
<i>What's in a name?</i>

19:07.916 --> 19:11.666
<i>A robin or a mouse?</i>

19:11.750 --> 19:15.750
<i>After all, under the skin</i>
<i>You're all the same</i>

19:15.833 --> 19:19.291
<i>It's what's inside that counts</i>

19:19.375 --> 19:23.125
<i>Fitting in could be a breeze</i>

19:23.208 --> 19:26.750
<i>Just a squash and a squeeze</i>

19:27.416 --> 19:30.583
<i>Brush out those ears</i>
<i>Come along with me</i>

19:31.166 --> 19:35.125
<i>Quick as a glug</i>
<i>You could be sitting snug, perfectly</i>

19:35.208 --> 19:38.416
<i>You don't fit in</i>
<i>But you'd fit into my belly</i>

19:38.500 --> 19:42.416
<i>For you, I've the perfect place</i>

19:42.500 --> 19:45.500
<i>For you, I've the perfect place</i>

19:46.958 --> 19:50.583
You really are a terrible mouse

19:50.666 --> 19:54.541
with nowhere left to sneak.

19:56.875 --> 19:58.625
Robin! And the star!

19:58.708 --> 19:59.541
And the…

20:00.375 --> 20:01.208
This is bad.

20:01.291 --> 20:02.375
Get back!

20:03.875 --> 20:04.708
Oops.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.833
That's made it worse.

20:23.041 --> 20:26.083
We did it! Everlasting happiness awaits!

20:26.166 --> 20:28.916
Told you us mice are good at sneaking.

20:29.833 --> 20:30.916
Sneaking?

20:33.083 --> 20:36.208
You know, I think we make very bad mice.

20:36.291 --> 20:38.208
Yes. Quite terrible.

20:39.125 --> 20:41.833
But who cares? We got the star!

20:42.333 --> 20:43.458
Terrible?

20:44.041 --> 20:46.791
I'm not a terrible mouse.

20:48.458 --> 20:49.291
Am I?

21:03.833 --> 21:04.750
This goes here.

21:05.916 --> 21:06.791
There we go.

21:08.375 --> 21:10.541
Isn't this wonderful?

21:13.166 --> 21:14.041
Suppose so.

21:15.458 --> 21:18.041
Well, I hope you thought
of something better to wish for

21:18.125 --> 21:19.666
than a soggy old sandwich.

21:20.625 --> 21:24.708
You know, like a hubcap.
Or a shiny fork. Or a pincil sharpener.

21:24.791 --> 21:30.000
Or a thimble. Or how about a safety pin…

21:35.916 --> 21:36.750
Yeah.

21:45.833 --> 21:49.333
Well, I wish I wasn't a bird.

21:51.041 --> 21:53.291
I wish I was a mouse.

21:54.500 --> 21:55.500
A real one.

22:12.958 --> 22:13.833
Magpie?

22:19.375 --> 22:20.250
Robin?

22:23.333 --> 22:24.166
It…

22:25.250 --> 22:27.875
It didn't work, did it?

22:29.083 --> 22:29.958
No.

22:37.541 --> 22:40.833
Come now.
It was always a bit of a long shot, eh?

22:40.916 --> 22:42.083
Stars and wishes.

22:42.875 --> 22:44.166
A fool's dream

22:45.625 --> 22:46.958
was what it was.

22:48.458 --> 22:49.291
A mad…

22:52.791 --> 22:54.000
fool's…

22:57.375 --> 22:58.625
dream!

23:03.083 --> 23:07.291
It works! Robin! The star!

23:07.875 --> 23:08.875
It works!

23:15.916 --> 23:16.916
A real one.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.375
What's that? For me?

23:19.458 --> 23:20.833
A lovely, shiny…

23:22.625 --> 23:23.916
Wonderful!

23:24.416 --> 23:25.458
What the…

23:28.625 --> 23:30.125
-Robin!
-Robin!

23:30.833 --> 23:31.875
Robin!

23:33.791 --> 23:34.708
Dad?

23:35.333 --> 23:37.583
We've been looking everywhere for you!

23:38.083 --> 23:39.958
-Robin?
-Sorry, I…

23:40.541 --> 23:43.666
I went to sneak us some crumbs, but…

23:44.250 --> 23:45.375
it all went wrong.

23:46.000 --> 23:48.375
Because, well,

23:49.333 --> 23:50.250
I think I'm a…

23:51.375 --> 23:52.541
terrible mouse.

23:56.416 --> 23:57.458
Robin…

23:57.541 --> 24:00.208
I couldn't have said it better myself.

24:02.958 --> 24:04.041
In!

24:05.583 --> 24:06.750
A kitten.

24:13.916 --> 24:14.833
It's all right.

24:18.916 --> 24:21.958
Don't worry.
There's no way she could fit through the…

24:22.458 --> 24:23.291
door!

24:25.916 --> 24:27.208
Oh, look.

24:27.291 --> 24:30.541
It's the whole family.

24:37.791 --> 24:39.083
What are you doing?

24:50.958 --> 24:52.541
-Robin!
-What is she doing?

24:53.125 --> 24:55.666
She's being a terrible mouse.

25:04.541 --> 25:07.333
<i>The rules of the sneak are these</i>

25:07.416 --> 25:08.416
And that!

25:08.500 --> 25:09.708
And this! And that!

25:31.416 --> 25:36.875
You really are

25:36.958 --> 25:38.625
a terrible,

25:38.708 --> 25:44.416
terrible, terrible mouse…

25:46.875 --> 25:52.208
with nowhere left to sneak.

25:53.166 --> 25:54.000
Wait.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.625
I don't need to sneak.

25:57.916 --> 25:59.666
I'm a bir…

26:02.458 --> 26:03.291
d.

26:07.083 --> 26:07.916
Robin!

26:12.083 --> 26:12.958
Robin!

26:43.666 --> 26:44.916
-Robin!
-Dad!

26:46.166 --> 26:47.000
Robin!

26:47.083 --> 26:49.000
That was the most un-sneaky…

26:49.083 --> 26:50.875
-And stupid…
-And brilliant…

26:50.958 --> 26:53.583
Birdy-mousy thing we've ever seen!

26:53.666 --> 26:56.583
Robin, you were marvelous.

26:58.666 --> 26:59.708
Thanks, Dad.

26:59.791 --> 27:03.125
Robin, you're not a mouse.

27:04.083 --> 27:07.250
But, of course, you're a mouse.

27:08.708 --> 27:11.375
-Sorry, is that confusing?
-Yeah, what? She's a bird.

27:11.458 --> 27:14.875
Exactly. She is a bird,
and that's wonderful.

27:14.958 --> 27:20.708
And what I mean is,
we're the mouse family. All of us.

27:22.583 --> 27:26.166
-Is the cat one of the family?
-No, Dink. The cat tried to eat us.

27:26.250 --> 27:30.250
-Because she loves us?
-No. Because she's a predator.

27:30.333 --> 27:33.958
-So, you fly now?
-Well, yeah. I guess so.

27:34.041 --> 27:37.833
But we're all still hungry,
and you've ruined Magpie's house.

27:38.583 --> 27:40.833
That's okay. They're only things.

27:43.125 --> 27:45.666
Yeah, and I'm bad at sneaking.

27:46.416 --> 27:49.041
If anything,
I just draw attention to myself.

28:08.625 --> 28:10.916
<i>Hey! Over here!</i>

28:11.000 --> 28:12.875
<i>A song for your ear</i>

28:16.458 --> 28:18.625
<i>While we keep to the shadows</i>

28:18.708 --> 28:22.041
<i>Don't get heard</i>
<i>Whisper every single word</i>

28:25.833 --> 28:29.708
<i>Look at me fly</i>
<i>Catching your eye</i>

28:31.666 --> 28:33.875
<i>-With crumbs in our arms</i>
<i>-And a raisin or two</i>

28:33.958 --> 28:37.333
<i>And a coin from the middle</i>
<i>Of this sticky brown poo</i>

28:37.416 --> 28:41.625
<i>Look at me</i>
<i>And you won't see my sneaky family</i>

28:41.708 --> 28:43.750
<i>-Don't make a sound</i>
<i>-Do make a sound</i>

28:43.833 --> 28:46.208
<i>-Don't leave a trace</i>
<i>-Do leave a trace</i>

28:46.291 --> 28:48.000
<i>-Keep to the shadows</i>
<i>-And to the light</i>

28:48.083 --> 28:50.125
<i>-Take what we need</i>
-This is more than we need.

28:50.208 --> 28:51.625
-Magpie!
-Thank you!

28:51.708 --> 28:58.666
<i>The rules of the sneak are these</i>

29:00.416 --> 29:01.250
Sorry!

29:10.208 --> 29:11.083
Well.

29:16.083 --> 29:17.541
It's a sandwich!
