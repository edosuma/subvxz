WEBVTT

00:17.017 --> 00:19.978
Prep the last wave for launch. I think
it's finally time to strike this tent.

00:20.061 --> 00:21.938
I have an incoming Jupiter.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.690
Doesn't make sense.

00:25.108 --> 00:25.942
Who is it?

00:26.026 --> 00:28.778
The signature's the Jupiter 2.
The Robinson ship.

00:30.321 --> 00:31.656
Jupiter 2, copy?

00:32.407 --> 00:33.867
Jupiter 2, please come in.

00:35.368 --> 00:36.953
What the hell are you doing?

00:50.383 --> 00:51.760
We should be close, any sign of it?

00:52.969 --> 00:53.887
No.

00:55.138 --> 00:55.972
Not yet.

00:56.306 --> 00:57.515
So, presumably, what?

00:57.599 --> 00:59.934
We find "X marks the spot,"
place Scarecrow there,

01:00.018 --> 01:02.103
retreat to an appropriately safe distance

01:02.979 --> 01:05.607
and watch the lightning... heal him?

01:06.149 --> 01:06.983
Presumably.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.236
The robot didn't give me
very detailed instructions.

01:14.074 --> 01:14.908
There it is.

01:41.851 --> 01:44.062
- It's okay. You're home.

01:44.145 --> 01:45.980
At least, I think this is your home.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.108
This is some very strange hospital.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.569
How's he doing?

01:53.822 --> 01:55.240
He's down to two lights.

02:05.667 --> 02:07.252
We're gonna make things right by you.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.174
-What's that?

02:13.258 --> 02:15.593
No. No, it can't be happening yet.

02:21.474 --> 02:25.019
It appears to be our lightning storm.
That's inconvenient.

02:35.905 --> 02:37.657
It's gonna hit us in a few minutes.

02:38.199 --> 02:40.326
Scarecrow won't make it through the night.

02:40.618 --> 02:42.704
-It has to be now.
-You think we have time

02:42.787 --> 02:45.498
-to make it there and back?
-We have time to get there.

02:45.707 --> 02:47.292
The Jupiter'll act as a Faraday cage.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.961
You'll be safe in here
until someone can pick you up.

02:50.044 --> 02:51.004
I'm going with you.

02:51.087 --> 02:53.590
You're staying here,
because you have an important job to do.

02:53.715 --> 02:54.757
From the cockpit?

02:54.841 --> 02:56.176
On Alpha Centauri.

02:57.802 --> 03:00.513
You're the only one who truly knows
what happened here.

03:01.306 --> 03:02.891
I've made mistakes,

03:03.224 --> 03:06.436
and you can tell them that
I tried to fix it before it was too late.

03:06.519 --> 03:07.604
Tell who?

03:09.981 --> 03:11.441
My boys.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.110
My wife.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.528
Can you do that for me?

03:17.238 --> 03:19.407
Will, I'm trusting you. Will.

03:20.700 --> 03:22.827
But not enough to think
you wouldn't chase after me.

03:24.495 --> 03:26.539
No. No! Wait!

03:27.832 --> 03:30.043
Ben! No!

03:57.987 --> 03:59.155
This is the spot, then.

03:59.906 --> 04:00.740
Good.

04:01.866 --> 04:04.535
Ben, we can figure out
some other way to do this. Ben!

04:04.661 --> 04:06.037
Will, it's okay.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.080
<i>Ben.</i>

04:07.163 --> 04:08.539
<i>It's okay, Will.</i>

04:10.458 --> 04:14.254
Thank you for reminding me
who I used to be.

04:25.139 --> 04:27.767
Next time we meet, how about...

04:29.310 --> 04:31.437
let's do things differently
from the start.

05:16.065 --> 05:17.650
Mayday! Mayday!

05:17.859 --> 05:19.986
This is Will Robinson
aboard the Jupiter 2.

05:20.069 --> 05:21.237
Can anybody hear me?

05:21.821 --> 05:23.197
Mayday! Mayday!

06:53.830 --> 06:56.541
Penny, pick up the pace.
Okay, come on, come on.

06:57.750 --> 06:58.584
Hey.

06:58.918 --> 07:01.212
You two are not supposed to be
walking around unaccompanied.

07:03.548 --> 07:05.091
I'm so sorry, I, um--

07:05.508 --> 07:07.009
Gonna need to search your cart.

07:08.136 --> 07:10.346
I'm so sorry, we were just--
We're restocking our Jupiter.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.266
This is actually for our new Jupiter
with our new legal guardians,

07:13.349 --> 07:16.102
the Osovedos,
and it's just been really hard.

07:16.185 --> 07:17.770
And I'm sorry, is that a crime too?

07:20.940 --> 07:22.024
I read the report.

07:22.817 --> 07:24.360
I'm sorry about your parents.

07:25.820 --> 07:26.779
You can go.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.078
Too much?

07:35.538 --> 07:37.540
<i>Docking ports 27 through 43...</i>

07:37.623 --> 07:39.500
Okay, this-- This is it.
Penny, this is it.

07:39.584 --> 07:42.128
-All right, all right, all right.
-Slow down, slow down, slow down.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.093
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:49.552 --> 07:50.386
Hi.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.100
- Run into any problems?
- No.

07:57.226 --> 07:58.978
I think I got everyone's order right.

08:02.398 --> 08:03.941
I don't know what we'd do without you.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.401
Well, you wouldn't have sandwiches.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.654
Any word from Will?

08:09.447 --> 08:11.199
No. Not yet.

08:13.910 --> 08:15.703
You better get going before you're seen.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.413
Okay.

08:20.458 --> 08:21.292
Okay.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.757
Hey, where's the mustard?
This salami tastes like tofu.

08:28.132 --> 08:29.383
You know it's all tofu, right?

08:29.926 --> 08:31.177
Oh. Ah.

08:34.805 --> 08:38.434
<i>Docking ports</i>
<i>44 to 60, prepare for incoming Jupiters.</i>

08:38.726 --> 08:40.394
That's the last wave arriving.

08:40.478 --> 08:43.523
If Will's not here by the time
the last of the colonists are here,

08:44.023 --> 08:46.317
how long do you think
Hastings would wait for him?

08:46.442 --> 08:49.612
Well, I'm going as fast as I can,
and we're trying to break into a place

08:49.695 --> 08:51.697
that was built to never be broken into.

08:52.073 --> 08:52.949
Just keep trying.

08:53.032 --> 08:55.993
So once we get to the robot,
what are we gonna do then?

08:56.077 --> 08:58.538
Make sure the robot's still
on our side.

09:07.964 --> 09:09.549
Has the robot found a way

09:09.632 --> 09:12.009
to get from wherever this place is
to the colony?

09:12.093 --> 09:14.387
It's like looking for a needle
in a haystack.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.055
It found the needle.

09:16.138 --> 09:18.766
Radio signature from one of our Jupiters,
it seems.

09:18.975 --> 09:20.643
The signal is weak, barely a whisper,

09:20.726 --> 09:23.187
but there's only one place
you're gonna find a signal like that.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.064
Alpha Centauri.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.066
Once the last ships have arrived,

09:27.567 --> 09:29.110
then we can get out of here.

09:29.610 --> 09:31.320
Contact, ma'am, from the planet.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.531
Two ships incoming
from the equatorial region.

09:33.614 --> 09:34.699
Oh. And there they are.

09:38.995 --> 09:41.330
-Identify them.
-The lead ship is a Jupiter.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.790
And the second ship?

09:42.873 --> 09:43.833
Unknown.

09:43.916 --> 09:47.044
<i> </i>Resolute, <i>do you copy?</i>
<i>This is Victor Dahr piloting the Jupiter 2</i>

09:47.169 --> 09:50.089
<i>with the remaining colonists.</i>
<i>We've sustained heavy damage</i>

09:50.172 --> 09:52.091
<i>All other Jupiters destroyed--</i>

09:52.592 --> 09:55.553
<i>The robots are in pursuit.</i>
<i>They are jamming communications.</i>

09:55.636 --> 09:57.847
-How long until the Jupiter 2 arrives?
- Ten minutes.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.932
And how long until
the ship chasing it arrives?

10:00.016 --> 10:02.852
At its current speed,
it's 18 minutes behind them.

10:05.896 --> 10:08.149
<i>Mom. Mom!</i>

10:08.232 --> 10:09.859
Will, do you copy?

10:09.942 --> 10:11.152
<i>Mom, I'm with Victor.</i>

10:11.235 --> 10:13.863
<i>-They're coming. There's a lot of them.</i>
-He's alive.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.656
Yeah. And being followed.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.786
You might want to hang onto something.

10:21.704 --> 10:22.663
I'm gonna open the Rift.

10:22.747 --> 10:24.707
But Will Robinson's not here yet.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.335
No, but 98 percent of the colonists are.

10:27.418 --> 10:29.670
I'm not gonna sacrifice their lives
for his.

10:31.589 --> 10:32.798
Will, can you hear me?

10:35.509 --> 10:39.096
That noise.  That only happens
when the alien engine gets turned on.

10:39.180 --> 10:41.057
Hastings is trying to leave now.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.684
I'm not gonna be able
to burn through this ceiling in time.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.102
There's another way in.

10:45.186 --> 10:46.020
What's that?

10:46.896 --> 10:47.813
The door.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.400
Take us to Alpha Centauri.

11:02.036 --> 11:03.829
Take us to Alpha Centauri.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.126
Will Robinson.

11:10.628 --> 11:12.797
He shouldn't even be able
to remember him anymore.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.179
I thought you were dead.

11:20.262 --> 11:21.472
Common misunderstanding.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.280
Sleep tight.

11:57.591 --> 12:00.010
-Take us to Alpha Centauri.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.097
Will Robinson.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.570
-Take us to Alpha Centauri.

12:17.653 --> 12:20.281
Will Robinson.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.122
Put your hand on the control
and take us there.

12:28.706 --> 12:30.082
Stop, you're breaking him.

12:31.375 --> 12:35.296
Will Robinson.

12:43.721 --> 12:45.806
-Heh! Wow!

12:46.390 --> 12:47.808
We make a really good team.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.608
Maureen, I--

13:02.072 --> 13:04.158
I've got you. I've got you.

13:04.241 --> 13:05.618
No. No, no, no, no.

13:05.701 --> 13:07.787
Okay.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.163
Are we too late?

13:09.789 --> 13:10.873
I can't tell.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.249
Can you hear me?

13:19.048 --> 13:21.675
There! He's okay! You're okay. It's okay.

13:22.551 --> 13:24.804
<i>Jupiter 2</i>
<i>docking at bay 61.</i>

13:24.887 --> 13:27.056
<i>Emergency personnel standing by.</i>

13:27.389 --> 13:28.390
Will is here.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.061
Will is here. Okay?

13:33.312 --> 13:35.231
Hey. I tried to stop Hastings.

13:35.648 --> 13:36.482
Yeah?

13:36.857 --> 13:37.775
So did we.

13:44.532 --> 13:45.991
Okay, big guy.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.747
A little help here?

14:38.335 --> 14:39.503
You're okay.

14:41.046 --> 14:42.214
Isn't Adler with you?

14:43.132 --> 14:44.717
He got caught in the lightning.

14:50.639 --> 14:51.599
You okay?

14:54.685 --> 14:55.561
Hey.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.106
He wouldn't leave without you.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.691
We did what you asked.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.986
Scarecrow made it to the ring in time,
but I don't know what happened,

15:04.069 --> 15:05.946
and now there's an army of them
headed this way.

15:06.280 --> 15:07.406
Maureen!

15:07.489 --> 15:10.284
John. We need to get away from here
as fast as possible.

15:10.367 --> 15:12.703
Yeah, I think the only reason
we made it out is because

15:13.537 --> 15:14.830
we're not the thing they want.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.415
They want their engine.

15:16.498 --> 15:19.001
Well, maybe it's time we finally used it
for what's it's for.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.420
Please take us to Alpha Centauri.

15:22.129 --> 15:22.963
No.

15:23.839 --> 15:24.882
It's a new word.

15:24.965 --> 15:27.343
-I think he just likes saying it.
- Danger.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.220
Wait, why would taking us
to Alpha Centauri be dangerous?

15:31.138 --> 15:33.140
Once the alien engine's activated,

15:33.223 --> 15:35.100
how long does the hole in space open for?

15:35.184 --> 15:36.101
I don't know.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.562
Long enough for the robots to follow us
through the Rift?

15:38.646 --> 15:41.023
Maureen, we can't lead those things
to the colony.

15:41.106 --> 15:42.316
No, we have to end this here.

15:42.399 --> 15:43.692
How do we do that?

15:45.361 --> 15:46.779
We let the robots board the ship.

15:52.576 --> 15:54.370
-Bring the engine right up...
-Oh, God, sorry.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.080
-Can you finish this one?
-Yeah, thank you.

15:57.039 --> 15:57.873
Here comes the bait.

15:58.791 --> 16:01.335
Okay, let's keep the hallways cleared.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.879
As long as nobody's in their way,
nobody's going to get hurt.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.673
These things are singularly focused,

16:05.756 --> 16:08.842
they're gonna come right here for
this engine, once they get in this room--

16:08.926 --> 16:11.387
-We'll crush 'em like tinfoil.
-That's the plan. Come on.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.974
<i>Attention </i>Resolute<i> crew,</i>

16:15.432 --> 16:18.102
ten minutes to contact
with the alien hostiles.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.356
Okay, come on, let's hurry up.

16:24.483 --> 16:25.693
What's the matter?

16:28.487 --> 16:31.198
Adler just died trying to save Scarecrow

16:31.490 --> 16:32.616
and here we are,

16:32.700 --> 16:34.952
trying to destroy a hundred Scarecrows.

16:35.035 --> 16:36.412
A hundred of him.

16:37.746 --> 16:39.081
There's only one of him.

16:39.164 --> 16:40.332
He's special.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.002
Maybe Scarecrow was special too.

16:43.168 --> 16:46.171
Maybe, but we don't know what happened
to Scarecrow after you left.

16:46.296 --> 16:48.549
For all we know,
he's on that ship coming to attack us.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.344
I'm not sure
this is the right thing to do.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.389
We have to protect ourselves.

17:02.312 --> 17:03.981
Eight minutes to contact.

17:04.064 --> 17:04.898
Hey.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.900
We're gonna work until the last second,

17:06.984 --> 17:08.986
so I need eyes on the security office
camera feed.

17:09.069 --> 17:12.322
Once the robots board, I want to know
when they're 500 meters from this spot.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.782
Mom, I can do it.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.868
-Angela needs to stay here.
-Okay. Great. Good idea.

17:15.951 --> 17:17.077
Okay. Will, come on!

17:17.453 --> 17:18.620
Okay. Robot, come on.

17:25.919 --> 17:27.796
Okay, Mom,
we're in the surveillance room.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.631
<i>-How's it going?</i>
-We're still not ready.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.009
-You said "we" but you mean "Don."
-I can buy you some time.

17:32.092 --> 17:33.218
Judy, give me a hand.

17:33.302 --> 17:35.012
<i>One minute to contact.</i>

17:35.095 --> 17:36.722
John, I need more than a minute.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.112
Make sure you haven't got any metal
in your pockets.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.115
Any metal caught in the EMF field
will get crushed.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.038
He'd be proud of you.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.958
You know, it's been almost a year
since we went missing.

18:05.542 --> 18:08.045
I wonder if there's a wall
with our name on it on Alpha Centauri.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.215
What do you say we give them
one hell of a surprise?

18:38.158 --> 18:39.952
<i>Alert: Surveillance failure.</i>

18:40.035 --> 18:41.870
What? No. Where did they go?

18:42.496 --> 18:44.164
They must be jamming the cameras.

18:46.625 --> 18:47.626
That's not fair.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.754
Penny, talk to me.
How close are they? Penny?

18:50.838 --> 18:51.964
Let me call you back.

18:53.298 --> 18:54.383
I have one job.

18:58.428 --> 18:59.304
Let's go!

19:07.563 --> 19:09.690
Seventy-two percent.
Still not enough power.

19:09.815 --> 19:13.026
Anyone else remember what it felt like
to have enough time to do anything?

19:23.996 --> 19:25.998
I thought we wanted them to follow us.

19:26.081 --> 19:27.124
They will.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.712
Hurry.

19:33.213 --> 19:34.673
Motion sensors aren't working either.

19:34.756 --> 19:36.300
Don't computers always want to tell you

19:36.383 --> 19:38.343
when something's broken
in a really friendly voice?

19:38.427 --> 19:40.846
Computer, what are the robots breaking?

19:40.929 --> 19:43.765
<i>Bulkhead door G22 breached.</i>

19:43.849 --> 19:46.810
<i>Bulkhead door G23 breached.</i>

19:46.894 --> 19:48.228
-<i>Bulkhead door G24...</i>
- Mom,

19:48.312 --> 19:50.856
they just passed the junction G24,
you have to get out of there.

19:50.939 --> 19:52.149
Thanks, Penny.

19:52.441 --> 19:54.818
-How much power do we have?
-We're only at 80 percent.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.486
That'll have to be enough.

20:01.950 --> 20:03.744
How we gonna know
when all those things are in,

20:03.827 --> 20:05.704
-we can't even risk one straggler.
-You're right.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.789
Somebody's gonna have to be at the door
to make sure.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.042
Yeah. Okay. Great idea, Don.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.919
Okay. Everybody out.

20:13.712 --> 20:15.797
-Come on, I mean everybody!
- Get out!

20:22.012 --> 20:22.846
Come on.

20:28.518 --> 20:29.561
Run, Penny!

20:45.035 --> 20:46.411
-Don?
- <i>Not yet.</i>

20:46.954 --> 20:48.622
-Not yet.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.459
-Hit it.

21:02.010 --> 21:02.970
Come on.

21:08.308 --> 21:09.810
I thought it was supposed to kill 'em.

21:09.893 --> 21:11.728
We only got to 83 percent.

21:13.647 --> 21:17.192
I hope nobody minds,
but I'm gonna take the long way around.

21:19.403 --> 21:22.030
- Oh, my God.

21:22.114 --> 21:25.409
Now we can rewire the room.
Increase the power....

21:26.201 --> 21:27.452
destroy those things for good.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.037
How long is that gonna take?

21:29.538 --> 21:30.872
Probably the rest of the day.

21:30.956 --> 21:33.667
I need to redirect the power distribution
from the bridge.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.961
Everybody get back to work.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.301
<i>Okay, Don,</i>
<i>you should have access </i>

21:42.384 --> 21:43.802
<i>to grids three and four.</i>

21:43.885 --> 21:45.429
<i>Nope. Nothing.</i>

21:45.512 --> 21:47.180
-Okay, try it again, Don.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.598
Multiple contacts.

21:48.682 --> 21:52.477
Bearing 0-4-0-1-niner-0-2-5-0-3-0-0.

21:52.769 --> 21:54.813
Hundreds of unidentified ships
on an intercept course.

21:54.896 --> 21:56.481
-Hundreds?
-Where are they coming from?

21:56.565 --> 21:58.317
Each of the other four planets
in the system.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.776
How soon before they get to us?

22:00.068 --> 22:02.988
At their current speed, two hours.

22:03.071 --> 22:06.616
That's not even enough time to deal
with the robots that are already here.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.626
If we can't leave
with the robots already on board,

22:16.710 --> 22:18.503
why don't we just blow off the part
of the ship

22:18.587 --> 22:20.672
the robots are trapped in?
-It's structurally critical.

22:20.756 --> 22:23.717
Then do we have any more of those
anti-robot magnetic disk things?

22:23.800 --> 22:24.843
-EMFs.
-No.

22:25.844 --> 22:28.263
Okay, then how else are we gonna generate
a magnetic field?

22:28.805 --> 22:30.932
The Amber planet. It has an atmosphere

22:31.016 --> 22:34.061
which means it has an ionosphere,
which we can use to magnetize the hull.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.520
No time to try anything like that.

22:35.604 --> 22:36.563
Mom.

22:37.773 --> 22:38.648
What's this?

22:38.732 --> 22:40.942
The alien engine can go
on any ship, right?

22:41.026 --> 22:42.778
This is the maximum number of people

22:42.861 --> 22:45.113
that can safely breathe
inside a transport Jupiter.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.823
Judy, I appreciate you trying to help,

22:46.907 --> 22:49.034
but who's gonna choose which 97 people go?

22:49.117 --> 22:52.037
Plus, this number seems low.
There's some error in your calculation.

22:53.163 --> 22:55.832
There are 97 children aboard the <i>Resolute.</i>

23:00.879 --> 23:03.465
Kids breathe about 50 percent more air
than adults.

23:03.548 --> 23:04.716
My math's correct.

23:05.717 --> 23:08.095
-You're not suggesting...
-We're not discussing this anymore,

23:08.178 --> 23:10.639
-this isn't an answer.
-This is the only answer.

23:11.681 --> 23:12.682
No.

23:13.225 --> 23:15.602
When Dad was locked up
and Hastings was threatening us,

23:15.685 --> 23:17.687
he told us what you traded
to get Will approved.

23:19.147 --> 23:21.775
For the first time in my life,
I was disappointed in you.

23:21.858 --> 23:24.277
Judy, I-- If I'd known that--
That-- That--

23:24.361 --> 23:25.487
It's okay, Mom.

23:25.862 --> 23:27.030
Now I understand

23:27.114 --> 23:31.827
that sometimes an imperfect solution
is all we have.

23:31.910 --> 23:33.620
No, that was different.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.374
I did that so that
we could all be together.

23:39.042 --> 23:41.420
You did what was best for your children.

23:45.715 --> 23:46.883
Maureen...

23:47.759 --> 23:48.593
Judy's right.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.263
No, this is not happening.

23:52.055 --> 23:54.433
Do you actually not care at all
about leaving them behind?

23:54.516 --> 23:56.893
I'm not going with you, I'm 19.

23:56.977 --> 23:58.728
Nineteen?
What are you talking about?

23:58.812 --> 24:00.439
Do you think that you are grown-up now

24:00.522 --> 24:03.150
and the only grown-up thing to do
is to tear this family apart?

24:03.233 --> 24:05.110
-We can't all go.
-Don't talk to me in a tone

24:05.193 --> 24:08.113
that makes me feel like I'm irrational
or like I don't understand the logic.

24:08.196 --> 24:09.156
You are not Mom.

24:09.948 --> 24:11.491
And we are not a math problem.

24:11.950 --> 24:14.744
You always say that Robinsons are supposed
to stick together.

24:18.874 --> 24:19.749
Will...

24:20.625 --> 24:24.254
the robot won't have any trouble attaching
the engine to a Jupiter transport, right?

24:26.339 --> 24:27.340
Will!

24:32.512 --> 24:33.346
No trouble.

24:34.514 --> 24:37.017
Get this started. We're gonna have to talk
to the other parents.

24:37.100 --> 24:40.187
This is a decision that every family
will have to make for themselves.

24:41.855 --> 24:43.440
Can I talk to you for a second?

24:52.991 --> 24:54.075
I'm sorry.

24:55.785 --> 24:56.786
This is wrong.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.288
No. This is not happening.

24:59.664 --> 25:02.751
Someone is gonna find a solution
that's not this. We always do.

25:20.101 --> 25:22.395
I can't, John.

26:06.731 --> 26:09.234
<i>Carbon dioxide levels critical.</i>

26:09.317 --> 26:11.987
<i>Please evacuate Jupiter transport.</i>

26:14.739 --> 26:17.617
It's just us.
The other workers have cleared out.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.744
We have just a few minutes
before they realize

26:19.828 --> 26:21.454
the carbon dioxide levels are fine.

26:22.414 --> 26:24.332
As usual they've chosen a select few

26:24.416 --> 26:26.418
to travel to Alpha Centauri
and I don't make the cut.

26:27.794 --> 26:29.671
Spent seven months
studying the flight manual.

26:29.754 --> 26:32.757
Once I detach us from the <i>Resolute,</i>
they won't have enough time to catch us.

26:34.384 --> 26:35.343
We'll be free.

26:36.177 --> 26:37.095
What do you say?

26:37.679 --> 26:38.513
No.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.098
That's a funny word now.

26:40.640 --> 26:43.059
When people say it, I just don't hear it.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.770
- No. Doctor Smith.

26:45.854 --> 26:47.731
I don't want to do this.

26:47.814 --> 26:48.898
They've left me no choice.

26:52.068 --> 26:54.696
Give me one good reason
why I shouldn't launch right now.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.128
C-O-2 levels were fine.

27:10.211 --> 27:12.922
<i>Attention families of the </i>Resolute.

27:13.006 --> 27:16.343
<i>Boarding of all children is beginning</i>
<i>on the Jupiter transport.</i>

27:17.052 --> 27:20.472
<i>We need all children to report</i>
<i>to Jupiter transport for boarding.</i>

28:03.932 --> 28:07.310
Uh, listen, I got a lot of work to do,
but I didn't want to be rude.

28:09.020 --> 28:11.106
I usually skip the goodbyes, but since...

28:11.731 --> 28:13.233
I don't owe any of you money,

28:13.900 --> 28:15.068
there's no harm, right?

28:17.904 --> 28:19.280
I'll see you guys around.

28:19.864 --> 28:21.116
See you around, Don.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.623
-Don!
-Yup!

28:40.468 --> 28:41.469
Come on.

28:53.064 --> 28:55.442
So much I want to say,
but I don't have time.

28:58.069 --> 28:59.487
I love you so much.

29:03.450 --> 29:05.660
Guess we're gonna have to delay
that driving lesson, huh?

29:06.035 --> 29:07.662
It's okay, because I, uh--

29:07.746 --> 29:09.831
I should probably learn to fly a Jupiter.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.712
Here, I didn't want you to forget this.

29:19.382 --> 29:20.216
Hey.

29:26.139 --> 29:27.265
I love you, too.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.478
Oh! I love you so much.

29:31.853 --> 29:32.687
Okay.

29:34.939 --> 29:35.899
Hey, Mom.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.736
I always try to be helpful.

29:40.653 --> 29:42.989
Today, it's really hard.

29:45.283 --> 29:47.535
But you always try.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.830
That's what I love about you.

29:55.502 --> 29:56.920
Okay, come on.

29:59.005 --> 30:00.840
- Here you go.

30:01.299 --> 30:02.342
Thanks, Judy.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.724
I'm not going.

30:14.646 --> 30:15.897
You have to get on that Jupiter.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.690
This is about the kids, I'm not a--

30:17.774 --> 30:19.234
Kid anymore. I know.

30:20.151 --> 30:20.985
I know.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.238
Judy, listen to me.

30:23.947 --> 30:27.158
I know a lot of good men and women
who I've trusted with my life.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.118
But the lives of my children?

30:30.036 --> 30:30.912
That's--

30:30.995 --> 30:32.497
that's a different story.

30:33.414 --> 30:35.416
There's only two people that I trust...

30:37.085 --> 30:39.337
your mother and you.

30:40.713 --> 30:42.090
-Me?
-And the only way

30:42.173 --> 30:43.633
I'm gonna get through this,

30:43.716 --> 30:45.718
is knowing that you were there

30:45.802 --> 30:48.096
to take care of Penny and Will.

30:49.889 --> 30:51.432
Every single one of those kids

30:51.516 --> 30:54.352
is gonna need somebody
that they can count on.

30:54.435 --> 30:57.355
Now I've spoken to the rest of the parents
and we're agreed

30:57.730 --> 30:59.816
that you should captain the ship
to the colony.

31:01.442 --> 31:04.279
-Dad, captain?
-All the studying, all the races,

31:04.404 --> 31:07.073
everything that you have pushed yourself
to achieve,

31:07.782 --> 31:10.451
you've been preparing your whole life
for this moment.

31:13.079 --> 31:14.080
It's...

31:15.540 --> 31:16.833
It's time.

31:18.543 --> 31:19.460
It's time.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.092
I love you.

31:32.473 --> 31:34.100
I'm so proud of you.

31:35.935 --> 31:37.437
I love you so much.

31:42.233 --> 31:43.067
Okay.

31:44.861 --> 31:47.530
<i>Final boarding for Jupiter transport.</i>

31:51.576 --> 31:52.785
Oh, um...

31:55.330 --> 31:57.874
Am I supposed to make a speech
or something?

31:58.374 --> 32:00.376
-You'll figure it out.

32:08.927 --> 32:09.886
Come on.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.226
<i>All remaining colonists,</i>

32:17.310 --> 32:20.188
<i>it's urgent you proceed to Jupiters</i>
<i>for evacuation.</i>

32:21.064 --> 32:21.981
Come on.

32:24.692 --> 32:26.569
You know I would never leave you behind.

32:26.653 --> 32:28.863
- Yeah, I know.
-I was talking to Debbie.

32:29.906 --> 32:31.324
-Hey.
- You're with us.

32:31.407 --> 32:34.160
We have half an hour before
those incoming ships hit us.

32:34.243 --> 32:37.956
Our Jupiter 2's docked at bay 61. We need
to stock it with everything we can carry.

32:38.039 --> 32:40.541
-Stock it and go where?
-Jupiters are scattering,

32:40.625 --> 32:42.502
heading anywhere the robots aren't.

32:42.585 --> 32:44.045
Which is hopefully somewhere.

32:45.588 --> 32:46.798
I'll catch up with you.

32:53.012 --> 32:55.014
So, Maureen...

32:57.141 --> 32:58.434
this is awkward.

32:59.769 --> 33:01.312
I have nowhere to go.

33:06.067 --> 33:06.901
Hey.

33:07.151 --> 33:08.319
Where's he going?

33:20.498 --> 33:21.582
Danger.

33:24.961 --> 33:27.380
Besides the obvious,
what's dangerous about him?

33:29.590 --> 33:30.466
It moved.

33:31.175 --> 33:33.011
They've been moving this whole time,

33:33.553 --> 33:35.847
just so slowly that we didn't notice.

33:38.558 --> 33:40.685
It's trying to reach the power cables.

33:51.654 --> 33:54.866
Those wires connect the whole aft quadrant
to the main power hub.

33:55.199 --> 33:57.577
If it's cut, the robots are free.

34:06.586 --> 34:10.381
<i>Cargo bay door opening.</i>
<i>Proceed to a safe area.</i>

34:18.848 --> 34:21.642
The power's still holding,
but if they cut more of those wires,

34:21.726 --> 34:22.685
they're free.

34:24.312 --> 34:27.023
I guess you can't go in there
and fix it, can you?

34:40.453 --> 34:44.957
Okay, I can redirect the current through
the auxiliary circuits...

34:45.041 --> 34:47.085
Maybe I can-- Yeah.

34:47.168 --> 34:49.879
I can't do this from here.
I need to do it on the inside.

34:49.962 --> 34:50.963
Smith!

34:53.216 --> 34:54.926
I just have to move a wire, right?

34:55.426 --> 34:58.054
Don't need to be a brilliant scientist
to do that.

34:58.304 --> 35:00.932
The magnetic field wants to crush metal.
Your suit is metal.

35:01.015 --> 35:02.266
I'll go fast.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.143
You'll have a minute at the most,
maybe two.

35:04.227 --> 35:05.770
I'll go really fast.

35:16.989 --> 35:20.118
- <i>Why are you doing this?</i>
- <i>Something the robot said.</i>

35:20.201 --> 35:22.495
Robot only says, like, five words.

35:23.162 --> 35:24.580
<i>He only needed one:</i>

35:25.998 --> 35:27.083
Family.

35:28.501 --> 35:30.253
<i>My mother's dead,</i>

35:30.336 --> 35:33.506
my sister hates me...

35:34.632 --> 35:35.967
and for good reason.

35:40.263 --> 35:42.598
Your family is the closest thing I've got.

35:45.268 --> 35:46.644
This is gonna work, right?

35:48.062 --> 35:49.730
I move a wire...

35:51.983 --> 35:55.820
and your kids...
...will get away safe.

35:56.487 --> 35:57.321
Yeah.

35:57.697 --> 35:58.531
Yeah.

35:58.614 --> 36:00.616
Then it'll all be worth it.

36:09.876 --> 36:11.169
How are you doing?

36:12.378 --> 36:13.504
<i>Smith?</i>

36:14.005 --> 36:17.425
I feel like my head's inside
an alarm clock.

36:27.393 --> 36:29.312
I hate to say this, Maureen...

36:31.230 --> 36:33.232
but there's more than one wire.

36:34.066 --> 36:34.901
<i>Smith!</i>

36:35.401 --> 36:37.486
At least I bought you a few more minutes.

36:37.987 --> 36:39.155
Use them well.

36:39.405 --> 36:40.781
<i>Smith, just get out of there.</i>

36:41.324 --> 36:42.617
-Smith!

36:44.827 --> 36:45.828
Smith!

36:46.454 --> 36:47.622
Smith?

36:55.922 --> 36:57.006
Smith...

37:01.135 --> 37:02.595
You surprised me again.

37:03.512 --> 37:05.890
<i>All personnel,</i>
<i>please proceed</i>

37:05.973 --> 37:07.642
<i>to your Jupiter for evacuation.</i>

37:07.725 --> 37:08.768
John, come in.

37:09.185 --> 37:10.686
Maureen, where the hell have you been?

37:10.770 --> 37:13.981
- <i>We have to launch now!</i>
-None of the Jupiters have been refueled.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.067
The robots are breaking out in minutes.

37:17.777 --> 37:19.028
- <i>Judy?</i>
-Dad.

37:19.111 --> 37:21.364
<i>Don't scare the kids.</i>
<i>The robots are coming for you.</i>

37:21.447 --> 37:22.573
<i>Start the pre-launch.</i>

37:22.949 --> 37:23.991
Okay.

37:24.867 --> 37:25.785
What's wrong?

37:25.868 --> 37:27.703
That was Dad. We have to leave right away.

37:29.121 --> 37:31.374
Attention. Strap in or hold on
as best as you can.

37:31.457 --> 37:33.542
<i>Launch in T-minus three minutes.</i>

38:03.614 --> 38:04.782
Danger.

38:08.202 --> 38:09.996
No. Hey, no.

38:10.204 --> 38:13.332
You can't go. The ship can't make it
to Alpha Centauri without you.

38:13.416 --> 38:14.417
No.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.252
I mean it. You have to stay here.

38:16.335 --> 38:18.629
There's a bunch of kids
who are counting on you.

38:18.713 --> 38:19.964
You need to look out for them

38:20.047 --> 38:22.883
the way you always look out for me.

38:27.555 --> 38:28.639
I have to do this.

38:40.776 --> 38:41.694
Will?

38:42.194 --> 38:44.196
Will, where are you going?
We're trying to take off.

38:44.322 --> 38:45.281
It's too late.

38:47.908 --> 38:48.743
Will.

39:21.067 --> 39:23.944
Will Robinson.

39:25.571 --> 39:26.697
You know who I am.

39:33.954 --> 39:35.289
We don't have to fight.

39:39.585 --> 39:41.379
It doesn't have to be this way.

40:00.481 --> 40:01.857
Scarecrow?

40:04.860 --> 40:06.153
Will! Will, come on.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.530
Come on, come on.

40:38.936 --> 40:40.187
Judy, let's go.

40:42.440 --> 40:43.858
T-minus 20 seconds.

40:44.316 --> 40:45.776
I'm so stupid.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.236
I thought I could change them.

40:47.319 --> 40:48.779
Hey. Scarecrow came back,

40:48.863 --> 40:51.449
and as far as I'm concerned,
one might be an exception, but two?

40:52.032 --> 40:53.576
Maybe that's the start of something big.

41:43.125 --> 41:45.586
<i>Dad, we took a hit,</i>
<i>I lost engine number one.</i>

41:45.669 --> 41:47.046
-Is it critical?
<i>-No, but</i>

41:47.129 --> 41:49.965
I can't accelerate, we're too close
to the <i>Resolute </i>to open the Rift.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.635
Robots are gonna catch them
before they get out of here.

41:53.636 --> 41:55.012
Judy, don't worry.

41:55.721 --> 41:57.723
You'll be okay, we'll make sure.

42:00.851 --> 42:04.063
Whatever you two just psychically
communicated to each other, I'm in.

42:04.146 --> 42:07.858
You have other family to take care of.
Get them out of here.

42:09.360 --> 42:10.361
Take good care of my ship.

42:10.444 --> 42:13.489
Next time you see her, she'll look better
than when you left her. Let's go!

42:13.948 --> 42:15.866
As soon as they clear the airlock,
we launch.

42:37.721 --> 42:39.723
I'm dropping the bulkhead doors
throughout the ship.

42:39.807 --> 42:41.392
It won't slow them down for long, but--

42:41.850 --> 42:44.311
How exactly do you start
the <i>Resolute's </i>self-destruct sequence?

42:44.812 --> 42:46.772
The <i>Resolute </i>doesn't have
a self-destruct sequence.

42:46.855 --> 42:48.566
-It doesn't?
-Why would somebody design a way

42:48.649 --> 42:50.192
to blow up your own ship, that's insane.

42:50.276 --> 42:53.195
And we don't have time
to crash the ship into the planet.

42:53.320 --> 42:54.238
No, we don't.

42:54.321 --> 42:56.991
We're gonna crash it into that.

42:57.116 --> 42:59.368
Call out the coordinates
so we can lay an intercept course.

43:07.876 --> 43:10.546
<i>Request denied.</i>
<i>Potential collision...</i>

43:10.629 --> 43:11.463
Not now.

43:12.256 --> 43:15.134
How do you fool the ship into thinking
you're not doing what you're doing?

43:15.217 --> 43:16.051
Huh?

43:23.809 --> 43:24.643
Hastings.

43:24.727 --> 43:26.228
<i>Hastings, come in.</i>

43:26.645 --> 43:27.855
What do you want, Maureen?

43:27.938 --> 43:30.357
I need to override
the <i>Resolute's </i>safety systems.

43:30.441 --> 43:31.483
<i>Safety systems?</i>

43:31.567 --> 43:32.901
We designed those systems

43:32.985 --> 43:34.612
<i>to protect the ship from damage.</i>

43:34.778 --> 43:36.780
I'm not gonna damage the ship,
I'm gonna atomize it.

43:37.323 --> 43:40.951
<i>It's the only way that we can make sure</i>
<i>those robots don't hunt down our children.</i>

43:42.369 --> 43:43.287
Please..

43:44.997 --> 43:46.749
Sending the access codes now.

43:57.968 --> 43:58.802
I'm in.

44:00.679 --> 44:02.556
<i>Telemetry confirmed.</i>

44:09.146 --> 44:10.648
<i>Mom? Dad?</i>

44:10.731 --> 44:12.566
-Are we good to go?
-Yes! Go! Go!

44:12.650 --> 44:13.984
Come on, come on.

44:28.791 --> 44:31.168
Robot, take us to Alpha Centauri.

44:43.055 --> 44:45.015
<i>Warning.</i>
<i>Collision imminent.</i>

44:47.267 --> 44:49.520
We're-- We're not gonna make it.

44:49.603 --> 44:51.522
The pod bay is too far.

45:19.633 --> 45:23.512
<i>Not to interrupt this magical moment,</i>
<i>but anyone want to get rescued?</i>

45:27.266 --> 45:28.100
Come on.

46:35.918 --> 46:37.252
They made it.

46:40.506 --> 46:42.633
-How're we gonna find them?

46:44.927 --> 46:46.178
We'll think of something.

47:09.034 --> 47:11.328
Attention everyone, this is Judy Robinson.

47:12.371 --> 47:13.622
We're through the Rift.

47:28.345 --> 47:29.304
Hi.

47:30.597 --> 47:31.473
Hi.

47:55.581 --> 47:58.083
Hi, everyone, I'm Judy Robinson.

48:01.628 --> 48:02.880
I'm your captain.

48:05.382 --> 48:06.508
Everyone...

48:07.217 --> 48:08.802
grab someone's hand.

48:10.846 --> 48:11.680
Come on.

48:12.472 --> 48:15.058
Come on. Everybody take the person
beside you's hand.

48:16.268 --> 48:18.061
I know they're probably dirty

48:18.145 --> 48:21.398
and what with all the crying
there's a fair amount of snot...

48:22.691 --> 48:26.028
...but what's that compared
with all the alien microbes and...

48:27.279 --> 48:30.032
whatever else we touched down
on that planet.

48:30.741 --> 48:32.492
Some of you don't know each other.

48:32.576 --> 48:34.745
Some of us are brothers and sisters.

48:35.913 --> 48:37.080
Some of us are friends.

48:38.290 --> 48:40.042
Some of us are strangers.

48:40.626 --> 48:42.002
But from now on,

48:43.045 --> 48:45.047
none of us are alone.

49:53.448 --> 49:55.283
Scarecrow saved us.

49:55.993 --> 49:58.161
We wouldn't have gotten away without him.

49:59.830 --> 50:01.206
Did you know he'd be there?

50:04.167 --> 50:05.502
So, um...

50:05.585 --> 50:08.380
I guess you just... hoped

50:08.797 --> 50:09.840
he would be?

50:11.383 --> 50:12.926
Do you even know what hope is?

50:15.721 --> 50:18.432
Yes. Will Robinson.

50:18.849 --> 50:19.766
Good.

50:20.183 --> 50:22.519
I feel like Alpha Centauri
looked different in the brochure.

50:26.064 --> 50:27.691
Huh, yeah.

50:28.483 --> 50:30.777
There's only one sun.

50:32.529 --> 50:34.239
There should be a yellow one,

50:34.573 --> 50:36.616
an orange one, and a red dwarf.

50:51.923 --> 50:53.216
What happened here?

50:54.301 --> 50:55.594
Where did you take us?

51:02.559 --> 51:05.562
It's definitely a human-made
radar signature.

51:05.645 --> 51:06.980
Yeah, but this is not the colony.

51:08.065 --> 51:10.609
Well, then, what radar signature
were we following?

51:27.334 --> 51:28.794
What is the <i>Fortuna?</i>

51:31.755 --> 51:35.926
The <i>Fortuna</i>
was a ship that everyone thought

51:36.635 --> 51:38.678
was lost almost 20 years ago.

51:41.389 --> 51:43.391
It was commanded by Grant Kelly...

51:47.187 --> 51:48.313
my father.
