<i>Now, onto trail conditions,</i>

01:37.998 --> 01:40.732
we've got another cold front
coming across Truman county

01:40.734 --> 01:42.699
for the next few days,
onto the weekend.

01:42.701 --> 01:45.669
Temperature drops overnight
can hit 25 degrees.

01:49.242 --> 01:50.975
<i>Make sure to carry
with you extra water</i>

01:50.977 --> 01:54.443
and be prepared for an increase
in frostbite related calls.

01:54.445 --> 01:56.980
Stay safe.
Stay warm out there.

02:10.428 --> 02:11.962
If you see any hikers out there,

02:11.964 --> 02:14.031
walk them through
our standard precautions.

02:22.941 --> 02:24.776
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

02:25.009 --> 02:26.742
We'll be moving
the public waiting line

02:26.744 --> 02:29.645
for the Botany exhibit indoors
through the rest of the week.

03:04.015 --> 03:04.915
Hey.

03:05.316 --> 03:07.117
- Honey.
- Mm-hmm.

03:07.784 --> 03:09.885
<i>There has also been
an increase in bear</i>

03:09.887 --> 03:12.654
and mountain lion sightings
in the upper west end trails.

03:12.656 --> 03:14.522
As winter's setting in,
they're coming down the mountain

03:14.524 --> 03:17.058
looking for food.
You don't want to be that food,

03:17.060 --> 03:19.560
especially those of you
heading down the back country.

03:19.562 --> 03:21.664
Okay, we're gonna do
a roll call.

03:21.931 --> 03:24.565
Just give me a here people
and we can get this wrapped up.

03:24.567 --> 03:26.535
Oh, and no trades day of shift.

03:26.904 --> 03:29.536
It's getting too confusing
for the office to keep up.

03:29.538 --> 03:31.540
- Okay, Adam.
- Here.

03:31.941 --> 03:33.676
- Craig.
- Here.

03:33.910 --> 03:35.776
- Daniel.
- Here.

03:35.778 --> 03:37.678
- Davey.
- Here!

03:37.680 --> 03:39.214
- Chip.
- Where have you been?

03:39.216 --> 03:41.249
My car broke down,
I missed the bus again.

03:41.251 --> 03:42.952
- Maya.
- Um, present.

03:43.386 --> 03:47.520
Oh, Ms. McHolmes,
how nice of you to join us.

03:47.522 --> 03:49.223
Maybe you wanna tell us what uh,

03:49.225 --> 03:51.125
whatever tale seems to be
so much more important

03:51.127 --> 03:53.594
- than my morning minutes.
- Um...

03:53.596 --> 03:55.695
Actually, you know what?
Why don't you come on up here

03:55.697 --> 03:57.666
and do it for me,
and then I can sit down?

03:58.100 --> 04:01.101
Um, no ma'am,
you're doing great.

04:02.604 --> 04:04.606
I mean, uh, I didn't mean, uh...
I mean...

04:04.840 --> 04:08.574
Remember people,
to be early is to be on time.

04:08.576 --> 04:09.943
If you are not checked in

04:09.945 --> 04:12.211
at the beginning
of my safety meeting,

04:12.213 --> 04:14.814
minutes will be deducted
from your timecard.

04:14.816 --> 04:16.216
For those of you
who haven't checked yet,

04:16.218 --> 04:17.351
your assignments
are on the board

04:17.353 --> 04:20.219
and assignment packets
can be found in the eagle rooms.

04:20.221 --> 04:21.890
Stay safe out there!

04:22.791 --> 04:24.525
Stay safe out there!

04:30.264 --> 04:32.766
So, do you, uh,
know where you're at yet?

04:32.967 --> 04:35.602
- Nah, I gotta check.
- I'm at exhibits with Chip.

04:35.970 --> 04:37.769
Been after that guy for a week.

04:37.771 --> 04:41.040
Just look at his face.
It's... It's so...

04:41.042 --> 04:43.243
- Frat boy?
- Yes! Bing! Love it.

04:43.643 --> 04:45.277
Oh, looks like
you're not the only one.

04:45.279 --> 04:46.477
Yeah, you don't have to tell me.

04:46.479 --> 04:49.614
She's been bird-dogging everyone
I even glance at recently.

04:49.616 --> 04:50.582
Let's get her.

04:50.584 --> 04:52.751
Wendy, you really
stepped in it this time.

04:52.753 --> 04:54.152
Are you trying to get fired?

04:54.154 --> 04:55.720
What? What do you mean?

04:55.722 --> 04:57.289
I was being sincere!

04:57.291 --> 04:59.257
Just, you know,
the one time I'm late.

04:59.259 --> 05:00.593
Oh!

05:01.328 --> 05:02.660
What?

05:02.662 --> 05:04.098
Girl, you are late all the time.

05:04.298 --> 05:05.997
Come on, I'm not always late.

05:05.999 --> 05:08.032
It's adorable
that you think that.

05:08.034 --> 05:10.634
Uh-oh.
You're not on exhibits today.

05:10.636 --> 05:13.004
You're, uh, posting signs
on Hitchback Ridge.

05:13.006 --> 05:15.873
What? No, no, no, no.
I'm supposed to be on exhibits

05:15.875 --> 05:17.942
- flirting with a quarterback!
- Nope.

05:17.944 --> 05:20.813
I'm on exhibits, you guys
need to stop reading this wrong.

05:21.314 --> 05:24.117
- Um, Craigy.
- No.

05:24.584 --> 05:26.917
- Craigy.
- I'm not switching with you.

05:26.919 --> 05:29.919
I can do it.
Yeah, you take the info booth

05:29.921 --> 05:31.556
and I'll take the trail
and then...

05:31.790 --> 05:33.558
That way you get to see Chip
all day.

05:34.093 --> 05:35.794
Hmm.

05:36.762 --> 05:37.964
I know that face.

05:38.231 --> 05:40.331
Yeah, that's your pity face.

05:40.333 --> 05:42.665
- No!
- It so is.

05:42.667 --> 05:44.801
- I'll handle this for you.
- Thank you.

05:44.803 --> 05:47.039
Maya doesn't think
that you can do it.

05:48.206 --> 05:50.776
I'm just as qualified
as you guys.

05:51.144 --> 05:54.044
Yeah, don't you mostly do
like kiddie trails?

05:54.046 --> 05:55.945
What about the, uh, spider
that made you jump...

05:55.947 --> 05:57.814
- Oh, my God.
- ...15 feet across the way?

05:57.816 --> 05:58.817
You guys it was a black widow!

05:59.051 --> 06:01.384
- It was a daddy long leg.
- It was a daddy long leg.

06:01.386 --> 06:03.086
So, I don't want you
to get in your head

06:03.088 --> 06:05.321
- about this though, it's okay.
- It's not a big deal.

06:05.323 --> 06:06.855
It's just that
being on the trail,

06:06.857 --> 06:08.057
you kinda have to be,
like, tougher.

06:08.059 --> 06:10.959
- Yeah, hardy. Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Hardy is a great word.

06:10.961 --> 06:14.964
Uh-hmm. Come on you guys,
it's just tying signs to trees.

06:14.966 --> 06:16.866
No, it's a lot of rough terrain.

06:16.868 --> 06:19.168
And you have to be ready
to get your hands dirty,

06:19.170 --> 06:20.237
your pretty hands.

06:21.372 --> 06:23.972
Listen, you're an indoor kid,
okay?

06:23.974 --> 06:26.842
- Like, uh, Davey.
- Oh!

06:26.844 --> 06:29.613
- Oh, Davey?
- Oh, Davey.

06:30.947 --> 06:32.981
- We're trading.
- Wow, okay.

06:32.983 --> 06:35.853
All right, okay, fine,
your... your funeral babe!

06:36.120 --> 06:38.887
- Thanks, Davey.
- All right, calm down...

06:38.889 --> 06:40.989
Uh, let's switch packs, yeah?

06:40.991 --> 06:42.723
So, you don't have to go
through outfitting.

06:42.725 --> 06:43.893
Yeah.

06:44.194 --> 06:48.097
Here ya go, and, um,
you're sure you're okay, yeah?

06:48.099 --> 06:49.998
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.302
- Okay.
- I'll be fine.

06:51.569 --> 06:54.135
Great, I will see you later.

06:54.137 --> 06:56.270
Yeah, it's just
a walk in the woods.

06:56.272 --> 06:58.007
I mean, how hard can it be?

10:14.599 --> 10:17.333
Jesus Christ, Davey.
You scared the shit out of me!

10:17.335 --> 10:20.068
It's not my fault,
I called your name three times.

10:20.070 --> 10:21.238
You didn't look up!

10:21.605 --> 10:23.638
Oh, I'm sorry. Lemme help you.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.608
- It's fine
- Oh, nope, okay.

10:25.610 --> 10:28.078
It's fine. I've got it. Thanks.

10:30.212 --> 10:31.348
What are you doing out here?

10:31.782 --> 10:35.085
I'm refilling
the dog shit bag holders.

10:40.257 --> 10:41.424
All the way out here?

10:42.091 --> 10:43.390
Not usually.

10:43.392 --> 10:45.428
Usually, I work
with the maintenance crew,

10:45.796 --> 10:47.662
helping them
with electric stuff.

10:47.664 --> 10:50.931
- Hmm.
- But I left the gate open

10:50.933 --> 10:52.933
and one of the mowers
rolled down the hill

10:52.935 --> 10:54.268
right into a maintenance shack

10:54.270 --> 10:57.139
so, now I'm on
dog shit bag duty.

10:59.375 --> 11:00.509
Yeah.

11:07.082 --> 11:08.484
Do you ever feel like...

11:09.084 --> 11:12.119
I don't know, this isn't
the right job for you?

11:12.121 --> 11:14.121
No, I mean,

11:14.123 --> 11:16.525
I may not be the biggest guy
in the crew.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.994
They may not think
I'm the best person for the job,

11:20.995 --> 11:22.263
but I know I can do it.

11:23.164 --> 11:24.432
That's what matters, right?

11:27.001 --> 11:28.103
Yeah.

11:31.373 --> 11:32.374
Well uh...

11:34.109 --> 11:35.708
I guess I'm gonna, you know...

11:35.710 --> 11:37.110
get back to it.

11:37.112 --> 11:38.444
Okay, right yeah.

11:38.446 --> 11:39.581
See ya!

11:42.316 --> 11:43.283
Hey!

11:43.685 --> 11:46.454
I could come with you!
If you want.

11:47.087 --> 11:50.123
To make up for messing up
half your stuff.

11:50.125 --> 11:52.024
- I'm pretty much done.
- No, it's okay.

11:52.026 --> 11:54.361
It's just less work
for me now, so...

11:54.928 --> 11:57.598
Right, right.
I should probably go too.

11:58.365 --> 11:59.900
All right, see ya!

12:00.467 --> 12:02.033
Watch out for snakes!

12:04.304 --> 12:06.038
Okay, I will.

13:50.674 --> 13:51.841
Here.

14:10.460 --> 14:11.662
So...

14:13.263 --> 14:14.565
let's see.

14:17.834 --> 14:19.333
Okay. So, I'm here.

14:41.490 --> 14:42.824
I can make it up there.

15:19.393 --> 15:20.461
You lost yet?

18:07.056 --> 18:08.257
Yes.

18:41.556 --> 18:42.557
Okay.

19:56.729 --> 19:58.863
What's she talking about?

19:58.865 --> 19:59.966
I'm here.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.185
What?

21:42.131 --> 21:44.600
Okay. Let's get back here.

22:07.155 --> 22:08.256
Oh, shit.

22:50.931 --> 22:52.067
Hey!

22:52.666 --> 22:53.767
Hello!

22:54.368 --> 22:56.237
Are you okay down there?

23:00.708 --> 23:01.976
Hello?

23:08.349 --> 23:09.783
No, no.

23:12.119 --> 23:13.120
Shit!

23:21.127 --> 23:22.228
Okay.

23:24.697 --> 23:26.666
Okay. Okay.

24:08.440 --> 24:09.874
Hello?

24:17.882 --> 24:19.181
I, uh...

24:19.183 --> 24:21.052
I... I work for the park.

24:39.770 --> 24:40.770
Sir?

24:47.145 --> 24:48.146
Sir.

25:49.538 --> 25:50.739
Okay.

25:59.548 --> 26:01.849
Come in, this is Wendy McHolmes,

26:02.384 --> 26:04.886
is anyone there?
Please, come in.

26:10.091 --> 26:12.827
I've... I've got a code 030.

26:13.529 --> 26:16.997
Repeat I have a code 030, over.

26:20.867 --> 26:23.137
I have a dead fucking body here.

26:27.442 --> 26:29.441
<i>This is APAC Kevin
at base, over.</i>

26:29.443 --> 26:32.143
Oh, God.
Hi, this is Wendy McHolmes.

26:32.145 --> 26:35.180
I'm on Hitchback
just over the peak

26:35.182 --> 26:38.284
and, um, I have got a code 030.

26:38.286 --> 26:41.019
<i>You're breaking up Wendy,
can you repeat?</i>

26:41.021 --> 26:42.921
Um, there's a man,

26:42.923 --> 26:45.993
I... I think
he must have fell, um...

26:46.293 --> 26:47.861
<i>Switch to channel three.</i>

26:48.428 --> 26:49.429
Okay.

26:52.433 --> 26:54.299
Okay, channel three here.

26:54.301 --> 26:56.201
<i>Are you sure he is 030?</i>

26:56.203 --> 26:57.901
<i>You checked all his
vital signs?</i>

26:57.903 --> 26:59.904
Yes, yeah, yes definitely.

26:59.906 --> 27:02.574
Um, he looks like
he's been here,

27:02.576 --> 27:05.476
um, I don't know. He looks like
he's been here a while,

27:05.478 --> 27:07.446
um, like a couple of days maybe.

27:09.181 --> 27:11.316
<i>Wendy we don't show you
on any trails today,</i>

27:11.318 --> 27:13.953
<i>you don't have that level
of trail clearance yet.</i>

27:14.454 --> 27:18.155
Yeah, um, I traded
with Maya Davis earlier

27:18.157 --> 27:20.459
and, um, she had Hitchback.

27:22.094 --> 27:23.095
Fuck!

27:24.930 --> 27:27.965
Actually,
I'm not actually on Hitchback.

27:27.967 --> 27:29.167
I don't think.

27:30.068 --> 27:31.934
Um, I don't have my map.

27:31.936 --> 27:34.873
And I must have lost it
a while back on the trail.

27:35.741 --> 27:38.175
<i>Copy that,
okay now Wendy.</i>

27:38.177 --> 27:40.812
<i>Are there any distinguishable
landmarks you can see?</i>

27:43.915 --> 27:45.183
Um...

27:45.850 --> 27:50.188
yes, yeah, I can... I can see
Brighton Rock, uh, just...

27:50.989 --> 27:52.488
just across the valley.

27:52.490 --> 27:54.956
<i>Okay copy,
see anything else?</i>

27:54.958 --> 27:56.759
Uh, I'm on a ridge,

27:56.761 --> 27:58.628
just a big flat spot.

27:58.630 --> 28:00.463
<i>That'll be a good place
for you to be</i>

28:00.465 --> 28:01.366
<i>when the search team arrives.</i>

28:01.599 --> 28:04.399
<i>Now, is anyone else there?
Is anyone else hurt?</i>

28:04.401 --> 28:08.371
No. It's just me and him,
I mean the body.

28:08.373 --> 28:10.542
There's, uh,
there's no one else up here.

28:11.276 --> 28:13.543
<i>Listen, it's a long ridge
around Brighton</i>

28:13.545 --> 28:15.545
<i>but we'll reach out
to the fire lookout station</i>

28:15.547 --> 28:17.346
<i>and the proper authorities.</i>

28:17.348 --> 28:18.349
<i>Be careful up there,</i>

28:18.582 --> 28:20.282
<i>that area has active
wildlife warnings</i>

28:20.284 --> 28:21.950
<i>and category three terrain.</i>

28:21.952 --> 28:23.519
<i>It might take us a while
to find you</i>

28:23.521 --> 28:25.087
<i>without an exact location,</i>

28:25.089 --> 28:27.858
<i>just secure the area
and hold tight.</i>

28:28.392 --> 28:29.626
Okay, um...

28:30.227 --> 28:33.995
do I leave a sign
or tie a t-shirt to a tree?

28:33.997 --> 28:36.400
I mean, what... I mean,
what... what do we do now?

28:36.801 --> 28:39.034
<i>As I said,
a park official</i>

28:39.036 --> 28:40.501
<i>must secure the area</i>

28:40.503 --> 28:42.573
<i>and you're a long ways
out there.</i>

28:43.607 --> 28:47.141
Are the fire lookout people
gonna be here soon at least?

28:47.143 --> 28:49.513
Is... is anyone
gonna be here soon?

28:50.214 --> 28:53.447
<i>The area you're in
is about six hours from base.</i>

28:53.449 --> 28:54.715
<i>It's 16:00 now,</i>

28:54.717 --> 28:56.652
<i>they're not gonna get to you
before dark.</i>

28:56.919 --> 28:59.153
That's... That's not
until midnight now.

28:59.155 --> 29:01.155
I have to stay here until then?

29:01.157 --> 29:03.658
<i>No, Wendy. You need
to stay until morning.</i>

29:03.660 --> 29:06.560
<i>Every ranger pack is equipped
for these types of emergencies.</i>

29:06.562 --> 29:08.129
<i>You should be fine
for one night.</i>

29:08.131 --> 29:10.131
No fucking way,
are you out of your mind?

29:10.133 --> 29:12.466
I'm not staying here
with a dead body!

29:12.468 --> 29:14.568
<i>Look without an
exact pinpoint location,</i>

29:14.570 --> 29:17.003
<i>you shouldn't move
from where you are at all</i>

29:17.005 --> 29:18.706
<i>until we can send someone
up there safely</i>

29:18.708 --> 29:21.074
<i>and that unfortunately
won't be until morning.</i>

29:25.481 --> 29:27.350
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

29:28.117 --> 29:29.017
Shit.

29:32.187 --> 29:34.322
<i>Wendy?
Wendy! It's Sandra.</i>

29:34.956 --> 29:38.224
<i>Listen, someone has to stay
until the first responders</i>

29:38.226 --> 29:39.327
<i>can get to the scene.</i>

29:39.729 --> 29:42.094
<i>They can't get up there
in the dark for extraction,</i>

29:42.096 --> 29:43.265
<i>it isn't safe.</i>

29:44.332 --> 29:45.933
And me staying here is?

29:46.134 --> 29:48.001
<i>Well, it's safer than
you trying to come down</i>

29:48.003 --> 29:49.102
<i>in the dark
without even knowing</i>

29:49.104 --> 29:50.272
<i>where you are in the daylight.</i>

29:50.739 --> 29:52.438
<i>There's miles and miles</i>

29:52.440 --> 29:54.074
<i>of unmaintained woods
up there, Wendy.</i>

29:54.575 --> 29:57.378
<i>You could get lost
and we'd never find you ever.</i>

29:57.712 --> 30:00.045
But I'm not a forest, uh...

30:00.047 --> 30:03.081
service official or certified,
whatever.

30:03.083 --> 30:05.083
And anyway,
I'm like a park guide, you know,

30:05.085 --> 30:07.653
like, I like pick up trash
and I like hand out pamphlets

30:07.655 --> 30:11.056
and I tell kids not to start
forest fires, I'm not...

30:11.058 --> 30:12.759
<i>Someone has to stay
and trust me,</i>

30:12.761 --> 30:14.228
<i>I'm sorry that's you.</i>

30:15.029 --> 30:17.228
<i>They know the vicinity
you're in,</i>

30:17.230 --> 30:18.730
<i>just, just stay put.</i>

30:18.732 --> 30:21.968
<i>Tough it out and we'll be there
as soon as we can.</i>

30:27.575 --> 30:31.777
<i>And Wendy, you didn't touch
or move the deceased, did you?</i>

30:35.315 --> 30:36.249
No.

30:36.684 --> 30:39.420
<i>Good.
That's really good.</i>

30:40.753 --> 30:42.487
<i>Whatever you do,
make sure that you...</i>

30:43.656 --> 30:46.392
Fuck!

30:46.659 --> 30:49.262
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
No, no, no, no.

30:50.798 --> 30:53.533
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

30:56.101 --> 30:57.435
Fuck!

31:00.807 --> 31:02.139
Fuck!

31:58.296 --> 31:59.363
Hello?

32:03.869 --> 32:05.235
Anybody in there?

32:22.218 --> 32:24.387
I'm an employee
with the park service.

32:32.796 --> 32:34.364
You know it's, uh...

32:34.664 --> 32:37.233
it's illegal not to answer
a park employee.

38:11.224 --> 38:12.592
Oh, my God!

38:12.959 --> 38:15.561
Hey, hey are you okay?

38:34.980 --> 38:36.983
Shit, what do I do?

38:40.252 --> 38:41.485
Oh, fuck!

38:49.261 --> 38:50.462
Fuck.

38:54.632 --> 38:56.701
Fuck! Wait till dawn.

38:58.036 --> 39:01.740
Oh, shit. Wait till dawn.

39:03.241 --> 39:04.241
Okay.

39:22.159 --> 39:23.260
Okay.

39:24.729 --> 39:26.630
Okay. Okay, so...

39:27.164 --> 39:28.498
okay, so...

39:29.165 --> 39:30.167
Okay.

39:48.651 --> 39:49.817
Okay.

41:18.738 --> 41:19.840
Anybody in there?

42:26.372 --> 42:28.104
Come in.
This is Wendy again

42:28.106 --> 42:29.941
to office or Kevin.

42:31.476 --> 42:33.945
Come in.
My radio is dying. Hello.

42:34.913 --> 42:37.349
Come on.

42:44.923 --> 42:45.924
Come in.

42:47.192 --> 42:48.226
Shit.

43:05.409 --> 43:08.111
Ugh, yes! Oh.

43:08.680 --> 43:11.248
Hello, this is Wendy
to main station, over.

43:12.950 --> 43:14.849
<i>There ya are!
How ya doing out there?</i>

43:14.851 --> 43:16.884
<i>Have you secured the area?
Anything to report?</i>

43:16.886 --> 43:20.121
Um, I found a tent
about half a mile from the body.

43:20.123 --> 43:22.524
But it didn't look like anyone
had been there in a while.

43:22.526 --> 43:24.492
<i>Copy.
Did you find anything else?</i>

43:24.494 --> 43:26.995
I thought there might have been
something in the tent

43:26.997 --> 43:29.129
so I went in there
to check if...

43:29.131 --> 43:31.131
<i>Wait! You went inside the tent?</i>

43:31.133 --> 43:33.100
<i>That could be a crime scene.</i>

43:33.102 --> 43:34.504
<i>You should not have done that.</i>

43:35.071 --> 43:38.273
Well I was just... I was just
checking to see if there...

43:38.275 --> 43:41.844
if there was someone hurt or
if there was someone in there.

43:42.411 --> 43:44.511
<i>Look, I know
this might be hard for you,</i>

43:44.513 --> 43:46.914
<i>but you might have just
contaminated evidence.</i>

43:46.916 --> 43:48.184
Evidence of what?

43:48.818 --> 43:50.918
<i>Well, they probably just fell,</i>

43:50.920 --> 43:52.919
<i>nine times out of ten,
that's the cause of death</i>

43:52.921 --> 43:55.556
<i>out here, and it sounds like
that from what you've described</i>

43:55.558 --> 43:57.424
<i>but that's why the coroner
needs to come</i>

43:57.426 --> 44:00.027
<i>so just don't touch
anything else, okay?</i>

44:00.029 --> 44:02.263
<i>In the morning, you should
get back up on that ridge</i>

44:02.265 --> 44:04.130
<i>so the search team
can spot you.</i>

44:04.132 --> 44:05.531
<i>The team is gonna start...</i>

44:05.533 --> 44:07.536
<i>...a little before dark, copy?</i>

44:10.205 --> 44:11.773
There's someone here.

44:12.308 --> 44:14.208
<i>What do you mean,
like another hiker?</i>

44:14.210 --> 44:16.209
No, there's just a man.
He's just...

44:16.211 --> 44:18.213
he's just standing
over the dead body.

44:18.713 --> 44:20.313
<i>Well, go tell him to back off.</i>

44:20.315 --> 44:22.050
<i>That's the whole reason
you're there.</i>

44:22.417 --> 44:25.184
You just told me that
there might be a crime scene

44:25.186 --> 44:27.188
and that means that he might be
a murderer!

44:29.023 --> 44:30.155
Shit!

44:30.157 --> 44:31.191
No.

45:01.322 --> 45:02.456
Shit.

46:03.248 --> 46:05.180
You're with the park?

46:05.182 --> 46:07.285
Whoa, whoa! It's okay.
It's okay.

46:07.586 --> 46:10.387
You're okay, okay?

46:10.389 --> 46:12.157
What were you doing?
You shouldn't be here.

46:13.425 --> 46:15.125
I've been coming up here
for years.

46:15.127 --> 46:16.558
No, I don't mean the woods.

46:16.560 --> 46:20.064
I... I mean, right there.
There's been an accident.

46:20.297 --> 46:21.433
Who is he?

46:21.800 --> 46:23.568
I don't know, a hiker.

46:24.101 --> 46:25.835
The police are on their way.

46:25.837 --> 46:27.139
When are they getting here?

46:27.605 --> 46:28.905
Soon.

46:32.710 --> 46:33.677
Hey!

46:34.713 --> 46:35.680
Hey!

46:39.183 --> 46:41.583
Stop! You really need to leave.

46:41.585 --> 46:42.952
This is a crime scene.

46:43.454 --> 46:45.054
I thought you said
it was an accident.

46:47.024 --> 46:48.492
Maybe. Maybe not.

46:48.993 --> 46:50.528
That's why you need to leave.

46:52.061 --> 46:53.461
Hey, what are you doing?

46:53.463 --> 46:55.731
You're gonna contaminate
the... the remains.

46:55.733 --> 46:57.434
Oh, I don't think
he's gonna mind.

47:00.604 --> 47:01.705
I said stop.

47:03.606 --> 47:05.442
Stay, right there.

47:06.543 --> 47:07.610
Which one is it?

47:07.844 --> 47:09.679
You want me to stay right here
or go away?

47:10.013 --> 47:11.281
I can't do both.

47:18.488 --> 47:19.955
What were you looking for?

47:21.357 --> 47:23.460
Look,
I know what a fall looks like.

47:23.793 --> 47:26.095
Broken neck, broken bones,

47:26.996 --> 47:29.729
and this just... this just
doesn't look like that

47:29.731 --> 47:31.668
or at least not just that.

47:32.568 --> 47:34.336
What does it look like then?

47:34.771 --> 47:37.507
I don't know. That's what
I was trying to figure out.

47:38.073 --> 47:40.373
I was looking for a wallet
or ID or something,

47:40.375 --> 47:41.543
but he's got nothing on him.

47:41.877 --> 47:44.012
But I did feel...

47:48.417 --> 47:49.384
Hah!

47:52.119 --> 47:54.386
That thing doesn't still work,
does it?

47:54.388 --> 47:55.390
Nah, it's dead.

47:55.791 --> 47:57.258
I got one just like it.

47:57.826 --> 48:00.393
Oh, you've got a phone?

48:00.395 --> 48:01.763
Ah, not on me.

48:02.130 --> 48:03.598
I think I left it at home.

48:03.798 --> 48:05.533
Always have that damn thing
with me, you know?

48:05.868 --> 48:07.299
It isn't safe to be up here

48:07.301 --> 48:08.536
without a means
of communication.

48:09.705 --> 48:10.672
You know?

48:13.307 --> 48:15.042
When did you say
help was coming?

48:16.377 --> 48:17.278
Soon.

48:19.180 --> 48:23.050
Yeah, well, getting dark
pretty soon.

48:23.818 --> 48:26.687
- Yeah, they'll be here soon.
- Hmm.

48:29.456 --> 48:31.191
Lotta big critters up here.

48:34.160 --> 48:36.129
Actually, I'm surprised
they haven't gotten to him yet.

48:37.130 --> 48:38.299
In fact,

48:39.566 --> 48:40.567
kinda...

48:43.136 --> 48:44.569
As a forest service marshal,

48:44.571 --> 48:46.337
I'm gonna have to request
that you vacate

48:46.339 --> 48:48.174
the premises immediately.

48:50.845 --> 48:52.175
- Look.
- Go on.

48:52.177 --> 48:53.611
I'm just trying to help,
all right?

48:53.613 --> 48:55.313
Now, if you wanna stay up here
all night,

48:55.315 --> 48:57.450
sit in the dark with a cadaver,
that's your own damn business.

48:57.851 --> 49:00.718
But I'm telling you,
this is not the kind of place

49:00.720 --> 49:02.188
you want to be at night.

49:02.589 --> 49:05.157
Especially
a little thing like you.

49:06.693 --> 49:08.193
Lotta predators up here.

49:08.762 --> 49:11.161
If you find yourself
face-to-face with one,

49:11.163 --> 49:12.197
don't run.

49:13.132 --> 49:15.367
You're still a couple notches
down on the food chain.

49:16.335 --> 49:17.336
Remember that.

49:20.205 --> 49:22.608
Have a good night, marshal.

53:29.848 --> 53:31.016
What the fuck.

53:39.990 --> 53:41.325
Shit.

53:50.702 --> 53:51.836
This is...

56:11.838 --> 56:12.906
Oh, God.

56:15.875 --> 56:17.110
What the fuck.

56:43.302 --> 56:44.636
Okay.

56:57.082 --> 56:58.516
Hello.

57:20.304 --> 57:21.706
Is anybody there?

59:07.876 --> 59:08.943
Hmm.

01:00:00.127 --> 01:00:01.228
Okay.

01:06:08.717 --> 01:06:09.818
<i>Wendy?</i>

01:06:12.588 --> 01:06:13.522
<i>Wendy?</i>

01:06:16.291 --> 01:06:19.592
<i>you just
have to be tougher...</i>

01:06:19.594 --> 01:06:21.362
<i>tougher... tougher.</i>

01:06:21.696 --> 01:06:24.198
<i>Maya doesn't think
that you could do it.</i>

01:06:25.768 --> 01:06:28.000
<i>If you get lost,
we'd never find you...</i>

01:06:28.002 --> 01:06:29.468
<i>find you... find you...</i>

01:06:29.470 --> 01:06:31.673
<i>You aren't ready for this.</i>

01:06:32.006 --> 01:06:33.708
<i>Ever. Ever.</i>

01:06:34.709 --> 01:06:37.376
<i>And you have to be willing
to get your hands dirty,</i>

01:06:37.378 --> 01:06:39.477
<i>to jump 15 feet across the way.</i>

01:06:39.479 --> 01:06:41.781
<i>You mostly do like
kiddie trails, right?</i>

01:06:48.923 --> 01:06:50.524
<i>I'm sorry that it's you.</i>

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:52.459
<i>That it's you. That it's you.</i>

01:07:05.772 --> 01:07:06.773
Ha.

01:07:07.474 --> 01:07:08.508
Ha!

01:10:57.130 --> 01:11:01.001
You're just cells
and tissues and atoms

01:11:01.235 --> 01:11:03.569
breaking down
into their composite parts.

01:11:04.871 --> 01:11:06.706
It's a totally natural process.

01:11:08.608 --> 01:11:10.342
There's nothing to be afraid of.

01:11:12.178 --> 01:11:13.613
I'm not afraid of you.

01:11:16.448 --> 01:11:18.884
I'm not afraid of you.

01:15:58.456 --> 01:16:00.191
Hey! Stop!

01:16:00.991 --> 01:16:02.892
No! No!

01:17:08.490 --> 01:17:09.791
All right.

01:19:44.475 --> 01:19:45.343
No!

01:19:57.053 --> 01:19:58.088
Oh, shit!

01:21:32.613 --> 01:21:35.246
That's how we found you,
we saw you up on the peak,

01:21:35.248 --> 01:21:37.983
and the next thing we saw,
you were fighting a bear.

01:21:38.251 --> 01:21:41.087
I can't believe you fought
a fucking bear, dude!

01:21:41.488 --> 01:21:43.488
How did they find me so fast?

01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:45.356
Sandra convinced the police

01:21:45.358 --> 01:21:47.093
to come out early in the dark.

01:21:47.360 --> 01:21:49.460
I mean, we followed the peaks
by the moonlight

01:21:49.462 --> 01:21:51.228
almost all the way
to Brighton Rock.

01:21:51.230 --> 01:21:53.098
To be early is to be on time.

01:21:57.637 --> 01:21:58.903
A fall then?

01:21:58.905 --> 01:22:03.275
No. These marks indicate a bear
most likely got to him first.

01:22:03.542 --> 01:22:05.609
Poor bugger was probably
still alive.

01:22:05.611 --> 01:22:08.613
Wendy, will you sit down?
I mean, your leg.

01:22:08.615 --> 01:22:10.082
...fall probably
happened after.

01:22:10.650 --> 01:22:12.384
There's bear hair
underneath his nails.

01:22:15.354 --> 01:22:16.555
You're real lucky, miss.

01:22:17.088 --> 01:22:18.789
Once a bear gets a taste
for blood,

01:22:18.791 --> 01:22:20.759
there's no fear of humans
left in them.

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:24.661
This one was denned up in a cave
not a quarter mile up that way.

01:22:24.663 --> 01:22:26.264
Real territorial
this time of year.

01:22:26.832 --> 01:22:28.333
Smart of you not to run.

01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:31.403
If you had you would've
ended up like this fella here.

01:22:32.404 --> 01:22:33.772
Wh... who was he?

01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:36.540
Red Bumgardner.

01:22:36.542 --> 01:22:38.008
He's a local hunter.

01:22:38.409 --> 01:22:39.711
He went missing a while back.

01:22:39.979 --> 01:22:42.113
Camping. Presumed dead.

01:22:45.283 --> 01:22:46.551
This can't be him.

01:22:47.085 --> 01:22:50.053
He was here.
I... I... I talked to him.

01:22:50.788 --> 01:22:54.459
Look, honey,
whoever you talked to,

01:22:55.326 --> 01:22:56.361
was not him.

01:22:56.995 --> 01:22:59.695
This man's been lying here dead
for days now.

01:22:59.697 --> 01:23:02.466
No, I saw him, okay?

01:23:02.867 --> 01:23:04.334
He had a knife, and...

01:23:04.535 --> 01:23:05.737
Do you mean this knife?

01:23:07.104 --> 01:23:09.474
No. That...
That's not possible.

01:23:09.841 --> 01:23:12.441
Well, we need to get
his prints back to the lab

01:23:12.443 --> 01:23:14.711
to be 100 percent, but...

01:23:15.012 --> 01:23:17.178
- the photos match.
- Photo?

01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:19.116
Oh now, we found this
in his pocket. Here.

01:23:19.583 --> 01:23:21.184
It still works
if you can believe it.

01:23:21.385 --> 01:23:23.420
It charged right up
after we gave it some juice.

01:23:29.325 --> 01:23:30.725
I've been coming up here
for years.

01:23:30.727 --> 01:23:31.860
I've got one just like it.

01:23:31.862 --> 01:23:33.297
There's a lot of predators
up here.

01:23:34.431 --> 01:23:35.332
No!

01:23:39.870 --> 01:23:42.371
You had a rough night.
You did good.

01:23:43.439 --> 01:23:44.775
There's nothing
to be afraid of now.

01:23:52.448 --> 01:23:54.317
Miss? Miss?

01:23:56.752 --> 01:23:57.787
Is she okay?

01:23:58.021 --> 01:23:59.221
Are you all right?

01:23:59.890 --> 01:24:01.722
Wendy?

01:24:01.724 --> 01:24:03.491
Wendy?

01:24:09.986 --> 01:24:14.986
