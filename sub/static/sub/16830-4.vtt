- Sodium overdose.

05:53.615 --> 05:54.896
The prosecution claimed

05:54.921 --> 05:57.361
she force-fed him an entire
bottle of soy sauce.

05:57.395 --> 05:59.296
But her kid was beating her up.

05:59.330 --> 06:01.131
How could she have
convinced him to drink it?

06:01.166 --> 06:03.267
The defense brought that up,
but the jury didn't bite.

06:03.301 --> 06:06.136
Also, Owen was prone to
excessive eating and drinking,

06:06.171 --> 06:08.071
sometimes even inedible substances.

06:08.106 --> 06:10.440
The prosecution suggested
she might have just

06:10.475 --> 06:11.742
handed him the bottle.

06:11.776 --> 06:12.876
Which still amounts to murder.

06:12.911 --> 06:15.379
Penny says Owen got ahold
of the soy sauce on his own.

06:15.413 --> 06:18.215

they finished lunch

06:37.101 --> 06:38.202

06:38.236 --> 06:41.605
No, neither one of them were
targets of his outbursts.

06:41.639 --> 06:44.107
But I'm not suggesting
that Owen was killed

06:44.142 --> 06:45.742

06:45.777 --> 06:48.278
I really think that
his death was accidental.

If that's the case,
then Penny being in prison

learn to control those impulses,

09:04.682 --> 09:06.883
and Owen could not.

09:06.918 --> 09:09.319
And as he got stronger and bigger,

09:09.354 --> 09:14.658
those impulses became a danger
to himself and... and to others.

09:14.692 --> 09:17.394
You were scared of him?

09:17.428 --> 09:22.371
Yeah, I was afraid for myself
and for my daughter, Emily.

09:24.371 --> 09:26.269
Owen was my life.

09:27.271 --> 09:29.906
I did everything for Owen.

09:29.941 --> 09:34.244
And I realize now that
that was probably a mistake

09:34.278 --> 09:39.816
because my marriage suffered,
and... and Emily did, too.

09:39.851 --> 09:41.618
Is that why you thought
about killing him?

09:42.820 --> 09:44.654
You said as much on your vlog.

09:44.689 --> 09:47.491
That's just gallows humor. It was...

09:49.527 --> 09:52.242
...a way of coping.

09:52.267 --> 09:55.341
[Voice breaking] A week after
I made that stupid comment,

09:55.366 --> 09:56.788
my...

09:57.609 --> 10:01.438
my son, my beautiful baby boy died,

10:01.472 --> 10:03.340
and I will never...

10:07.412 --> 10:11.648
I will regret saying that every
day for the rest of my life.

10:23.394 --> 10:25.295
I have a potentially innocent
woman in prison

10:25.329 --> 10:26.530
for killing her kid.

10:26.564 --> 10:27.864
We need a suit for this interview.

10:27.899 --> 10:29.666
Great. As long as it's none of those.

10:29.700 --> 10:32.335
Pastels evoke openness and honesty,

10:32.370 --> 10:35.405
and paired with these...

10:35.440 --> 10:37.574
Mom's pearl necklace that she wore

10:37.608 --> 10:39.543
to distract America
from the one dad gave

10:39.577 --> 10:41.545
the ambassador's wife? No way.

10:41.570 --> 10:42.860
I can only help you
navigate this interview...

10:42.885 --> 10:45.882
This is one giant, terrible
flashback to our childhood.

10:45.917 --> 10:47.717
Every crisis, we were trotted out,

10:47.752 --> 10:49.386
told how to look, dress, act.

10:49.420 --> 10:50.587
<i>Your</i> childhood.

10:50.621 --> 10:53.256
Some of us were too fat and effeminate
to be used as show ponies.

10:53.291 --> 10:56.326
At least after the age of 11.

10:56.360 --> 10:58.728
I am sorry you endured

10:58.763 --> 11:01.565
a grand tapestry of gay alienation,

11:01.599 --> 11:04.018
but that is no reason for you to sign up

11:04.043 --> 11:07.370
to Wallace's mission to turn me
into a poster girl for regret.

11:07.405 --> 11:08.438
You need this.

11:08.473 --> 11:09.639
I don't need a spin doctor.

11:09.674 --> 11:11.942
I need my brother... the guy
who held my hand this morning.

11:11.976 --> 11:13.910
Let me be both.

11:13.945 --> 11:15.412
This job is good for you.

11:15.446 --> 11:17.547
I just want to help you keep it.

11:20.284 --> 11:21.852
I hate the peach.

11:21.886 --> 11:23.753
Peach out.

11:25.890 --> 11:27.591
Sorry.

11:31.796 --> 11:34.364
[Elevator dings]

11:34.398 --> 11:35.966
D-Dr. Soto.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.768
I-It's so, so good to meet you.
I'm Frankie Cruz.

11:38.803 --> 11:40.370
- Oh, yeah.
- Tess Larson.

11:40.404 --> 11:41.905
- Oh.
- Thanks for coming by.

11:41.939 --> 11:43.607
- Mm-hmm.
- Your toxicology handbook

11:43.641 --> 11:45.609
is, like, the go-to source for me.

11:45.643 --> 11:46.977
Oh, well, I'm putting out a new edition.

11:47.011 --> 11:48.879
Uh, give me your card,
and I'll send you one.

11:48.913 --> 11:52.082
Yeah, uh, maybe you
could sign it for me.

11:52.116 --> 11:54.050
[Chuckles]

11:54.085 --> 11:57.073
Uh, I have to be back in court
across the street in half an hour.

11:57.098 --> 11:58.455
Do you have the authorization?

11:58.489 --> 12:00.390
When Penny submitted
her case to the CIU,

12:00.424 --> 12:02.559
she gave us access
to all her defense materials

12:02.593 --> 12:04.561
and waived client confidentiality.

12:06.364 --> 12:08.798
My work up of Owen Price's case.

12:08.833 --> 12:12.636
The ER docs pumped
260 milliliters of soy sauce

12:12.670 --> 12:16.640
from his stomach, enough
to cause fatal salt poisoning,

12:16.674 --> 12:19.476
if he'd had the time to metabolize it.

12:21.512 --> 12:23.079
So the soy sauce didn't kill Owen?

12:23.114 --> 12:25.916
Well, I understand why the M.E.
would come to that conclusion,

12:25.950 --> 12:28.919
but Owen also had
a blood glucose of zero.

12:28.953 --> 12:30.820
I believe that's what
caused the seizures

12:30.855 --> 12:32.355
and eventually his death.

12:32.390 --> 12:34.024
Why didn't the defense
bring this up at trial?

12:34.058 --> 12:35.992
If you found an alternative
cause of death,

12:36.027 --> 12:38.662
why didn't you disclose it?
Could this have cleared Penny?

12:38.696 --> 12:39.796
Tess.

12:39.830 --> 12:41.965
My contract with the defense forbade me

12:41.999 --> 12:44.801
from revealing any findings,
and the defense had

12:44.835 --> 12:46.469
no obligation to reveal any information

12:46.504 --> 12:47.837
that would not benefit their clients.

12:47.872 --> 12:50.006
My findings did not.

12:50.041 --> 12:51.841
What did you find?

12:51.876 --> 12:56.379
Owen died as a result
of an insulin injection.

12:57.029 --> 12:58.949
This wasn't an accident.

12:59.410 --> 13:01.293
It was murder.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.976
_

13:11.001 --> 13:12.774
Owen's death was not from soy sauce.

13:12.782 --> 13:15.183
He was injected
with a fatal dose of insulin.

13:17.186 --> 13:18.607
Uh, I think our brother wants you.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.372
Ignore him. Maybe he'll wander off.

13:20.397 --> 13:22.514
Well, so much for this
being a tragic accident.

13:22.539 --> 13:23.992
It was premeditated murder.

13:24.026 --> 13:25.450
And Penny's still
the most likely suspect.

13:25.475 --> 13:26.616
Why?

13:26.641 --> 13:29.119
Owen's healthcare aide, Eduardo,
was at the house.

13:29.144 --> 13:30.345
He'd know how to give a shot.

13:30.379 --> 13:32.547
Eduardo wasn't being brutalized
on a daily basis by Owen.

13:32.581 --> 13:35.499
And 95% of child murders
are committed by parents.

13:35.517 --> 13:37.163
And that rises when
the kids are special-needs.

13:37.188 --> 13:39.132
If Penny's a suspect
just because she's a parent,

13:39.157 --> 13:41.456
then let's look
at Greg Price, Owen's dad.

13:41.827 --> 13:44.319
He was a pharmacist,
had access to insulin.

13:44.344 --> 13:47.195
According to the file,
Greg was at work that afternoon.

13:47.229 --> 13:49.771
I don't want to believe Penny did it,
but the dad has an alibi.

13:49.803 --> 13:52.475
Let's check out the co-workers.
See if it holds up.

14:01.243 --> 14:03.027
You think Penny's guilty.

14:03.052 --> 14:04.379
Well, nothing's convinced me she isn't.

14:04.413 --> 14:06.868
If she gets out,
she might hurt her daughter.

14:06.893 --> 14:09.217
Are you gonna pull some strings,
make sure that doesn't happen,

14:09.251 --> 14:10.876
like you did on our last case?

14:13.455 --> 14:15.356
Special circumstances.

14:15.391 --> 14:18.493
Cross that line once...
tempting to cross it again.

14:18.527 --> 14:20.477
- I would know.
- I'm not you.

14:21.186 --> 14:24.154
And our last client is still
in prison, where he belongs.

14:24.400 --> 14:27.171
- Justice was served.
- By you, not by the law.

14:27.196 --> 14:28.829
Sometimes the law sucks.

14:33.047 --> 14:34.827
So, Dan's gonna open
with a clip package...

14:34.852 --> 14:36.102
greatest hits.

14:36.127 --> 14:38.079
You painting your toenails
on the floor of the Oval,

14:38.113 --> 14:40.643
going to prom with
that Nigerian diplomat's kid.

14:40.668 --> 14:45.272
Ooh, I forgot about that
tall, cool drink of Lagos.

14:45.846 --> 14:49.563
[Gasps] Ooh, he is CEO
of a petrochemical company.

14:49.588 --> 14:51.944
Point being, he is going
to try to lull you

14:51.969 --> 14:53.124
into a vulnerable state.

14:53.149 --> 14:55.589
- You must stay on message.
- I wish he were still doing to me

14:55.614 --> 14:56.919
what he's been doing to Mother Earth.

14:56.944 --> 14:59.100
Contrition, gratitude for the new job,

14:59.134 --> 15:00.334
regret for your actions.

15:00.359 --> 15:02.060
My only regret is getting caught.

15:02.094 --> 15:03.497
Hayes, at this rate, you better hope

15:03.522 --> 15:05.493
that your Nigerian prince
is looking to hire.

15:05.518 --> 15:07.332
- You're gonna be out of a job.
- [Knock on door]

15:07.366 --> 15:08.366
- Hayes: Come in.
- We're busy.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.902
We got Greg Price's
former co-worker to admit

15:10.936 --> 15:12.871
he wasn't actually
at work that afternoon.

15:12.905 --> 15:15.169
Apparently he used to slip out
on a regular basis.

15:15.194 --> 15:17.636
Including the day his son was murdered.
Let's go talk to him.

15:17.661 --> 15:19.065
- You can't!
- Duty calls.

15:19.090 --> 15:20.395
Talk to Maxine.

15:20.429 --> 15:22.864
You keep saying you need
more black friends.

15:26.282 --> 15:27.716
[Chuckling] I haven't been saying that.

15:27.741 --> 15:29.209
You probably should.

15:31.373 --> 15:34.442
♪

15:41.554 --> 15:43.221
An insulin overdose?

15:43.823 --> 15:45.361
How could Penny do that?

15:45.386 --> 15:47.657
You work in a pharmacy.
Plenty of access there.

15:47.682 --> 15:49.149
Penny came in from time to time,

15:49.174 --> 15:51.632
but I can't imagine her
getting behind the counter.

15:51.657 --> 15:54.506
Maybe your wife wasn't
the one who gave it to him.

15:54.531 --> 15:56.197
Wait, who, then? Eduardo?

15:56.232 --> 15:57.576
He was devoted to Owen.

15:57.601 --> 15:59.500
So was Penny.

15:59.935 --> 16:01.602
I checked the prison logs.

16:01.637 --> 16:03.404
You never visit her.

16:03.438 --> 16:05.406
I take Emily every week.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.087
I stay in the car.

16:07.112 --> 16:09.336
I can't face her or forgive her.

16:09.361 --> 16:12.263
And yet you haven't gotten a divorce.

16:12.297 --> 16:13.598
I still love her.

16:13.632 --> 16:16.701
I know that doesn't make sense.
She killed my son.

16:16.726 --> 16:19.595
Not that I don't have
a share of the blame.

16:19.638 --> 16:21.405
What does that mean?

16:21.430 --> 16:25.109
I wasn't, um, exactly an all-star dad.

16:25.144 --> 16:27.145
I was always working.

16:27.633 --> 16:33.684
Every day, when I left home,
I felt guilty and relieved.

16:33.719 --> 16:35.643
It... It was just too much.

16:35.668 --> 16:37.934
The constant chaos and screaming.

16:39.224 --> 16:42.627
Even Penny's optimism wore on me.

16:42.661 --> 16:46.296
She just couldn't stop believing
that Owen was gonna get better.

16:46.321 --> 16:48.985
We talked to your alibi
for the day that Owen died.

16:49.579 --> 16:51.314
His story's changed.

16:53.405 --> 16:55.418
Emily, can you get our guests
something to drink?

17:04.926 --> 17:06.521
It must be tough

17:07.286 --> 17:09.387
only seeing your mother
a couple hours a week.

17:09.421 --> 17:10.821
We make the most of it.

17:10.856 --> 17:12.824
She helps me with my homework.

17:12.858 --> 17:15.057
Sometimes we play games.

17:16.737 --> 17:18.955
She's a really good mom.

17:19.446 --> 17:21.056
I can tell.

17:21.599 --> 17:23.440
Do you think your mom...
Could she have...

17:23.464 --> 17:25.496
She loved Owen so much.

17:25.868 --> 17:27.979
Even when he hit her, she never got mad.

17:28.003 --> 17:29.504
Just took it.

17:30.455 --> 17:33.254
Owen couldn't help it,
but he was so hard to take care of.

17:33.445 --> 17:35.097
She was doing everything she could.

17:35.122 --> 17:37.465
It was a tough situation for everybody.

17:37.490 --> 17:41.279
As bad as it was then,
at least we were still a family.

17:42.421 --> 17:43.621
[Sighs]

17:43.655 --> 17:44.854
Now we're just...

17:44.879 --> 17:47.380
Camden College early admission.

17:47.759 --> 17:49.594
Congratulations.

17:49.628 --> 17:51.190
I'm not going.

17:52.152 --> 17:55.654
Dad needs me, and I can't
miss a weekend with mom.

17:56.142 --> 17:57.869
Look, the day Owen died,

17:57.903 --> 18:00.638
I had a buddy of mine
clock me back in from lunch.

18:00.672 --> 18:04.109
So you could slip home
and kill your son?

18:05.724 --> 18:07.745
You have any idea
what this has been like?

18:07.779 --> 18:09.614
I lost half my family on one day.

18:09.648 --> 18:12.152
Beats going to prison yourself
for murdering Owen.

18:12.177 --> 18:14.185
- I didn't do that.
- Then where were you?

18:15.075 --> 18:16.816
Not at work, like you told the cops.

18:16.841 --> 18:19.457
I was with a friend.

18:19.491 --> 18:21.425
Her name is Candace Randall.

18:21.460 --> 18:23.089
We were together that afternoon.

18:23.114 --> 18:24.428
I was with her at the Pelway Inn.

18:24.453 --> 18:26.330
You were cheating on Penny?

18:26.365 --> 18:28.200
I met Candace at work.

18:28.834 --> 18:32.136
A-At first, it was just
flirtation, and then...

18:32.599 --> 18:34.639
[Sighs] She was fun.

18:34.673 --> 18:36.310
She was always laughing.

18:37.509 --> 18:39.911
Penny and I used
to have that, but then...

18:39.945 --> 18:42.689
But your special-needs child
got in the way.

18:44.683 --> 18:46.947
[Sighs]

18:46.972 --> 18:48.955
There hasn't been
any closure for that family.

18:48.980 --> 18:50.380
Closure's a lie.

18:50.614 --> 18:51.744
Whoever killed Owen,

18:51.769 --> 18:54.792
the Prices will never be
the same, especially Emily.

18:54.826 --> 18:57.461
A 17-year-old girl shouldn't be
taking care of her father

18:57.496 --> 18:58.853
and holding the family together.

18:58.878 --> 19:00.464
It's not fair.

19:00.499 --> 19:02.347
Who did you have to take care of?

19:03.869 --> 19:05.420
Let's go talk to Greg's mistress.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.412
See if she backs up his story.

19:11.482 --> 19:13.378
Greg and I were so in love.

19:13.403 --> 19:15.404
That's beautiful. But we don't care.

19:15.547 --> 19:17.615
Did you see Greg the day Owen died?

19:17.649 --> 19:19.483
Yes, that afternoon.

19:19.518 --> 19:22.553
We tried to slip away to the Pelway Inn
at least once a week.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.242
- When did you get there?
- Around lunchtime.

19:24.267 --> 19:27.054
Mm. Afternoon delight at the Pelway Inn.

19:27.079 --> 19:28.265
Did you spring for the magic fingers?

19:28.290 --> 19:29.953
It wasn't like you think.

19:30.662 --> 19:32.630
Greg and I both felt terrible
that he was cheating,

19:32.664 --> 19:34.732
but he was so miserable.

19:34.766 --> 19:36.259
Our time together was his only refuge

19:36.284 --> 19:37.984
from the hell he was
dealing with at home.

19:38.009 --> 19:39.303
What do you mean?

19:39.338 --> 19:40.970
Well, his son was out of control.

19:40.995 --> 19:43.548
His... His wife had
no bandwidth for anyone else,

19:43.573 --> 19:44.742
least of all Greg.

19:44.776 --> 19:46.219
She was too busy. She was either

19:46.244 --> 19:48.518
taking care of Owen or being
the online autism martyr.

19:48.543 --> 19:51.415
The day Owen died...
How late did Greg stay?

19:51.450 --> 19:54.218
Most days we were
at the motel until around 5:00,

19:54.253 --> 19:56.920
but, um, that day, we got into a fight.

19:56.945 --> 19:58.648
About what?

19:59.258 --> 20:00.858
I really wanted a family.

20:00.892 --> 20:03.368
But Greg felt that
he couldn't divorce Penny

20:03.393 --> 20:05.063
and leave her alone with Owen.

20:05.897 --> 20:07.407
The difference was that afternoon,

20:07.432 --> 20:09.594
I told him that
I was done being an escape

20:09.619 --> 20:10.836
from his unhappy home life.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.535
Either he got a divorce,
or we were through.

20:12.560 --> 20:13.912
How'd he react?

20:14.439 --> 20:17.008
He took off... really upset.

20:17.042 --> 20:20.411
That was the last time that
Greg and I were ever... together.

20:20.445 --> 20:22.546
After Owen died,
things were never the same.

20:22.581 --> 20:24.448
When did Greg leave?

20:24.799 --> 20:27.307
Uh, around 2:15.

20:29.454 --> 20:31.094
Thank you for coming in.
We appreciate it.

20:38.897 --> 20:41.699
Greg had access to insulin,
time to get home.

20:41.724 --> 20:44.341
And a mistress who all but
asked him to bump off his son.

20:53.789 --> 20:55.752
_

20:55.777 --> 20:58.412
Greg Price's mistress
blew his alibi out of the water.

20:58.445 --> 21:00.179
He left the motel at 2:15.

21:00.214 --> 21:02.225
Could have gotten home in time
to inject Owen with the insulin.

21:02.250 --> 21:03.761
Dad's still alive as a suspect.

21:03.786 --> 21:05.683
You ready to give Penny
the benefit of the doubt?

21:05.708 --> 21:08.361
Hey, I saw the promo
for your Dan Harris interview.

21:08.386 --> 21:11.190
Are you ready to eat crow
on national TV?

21:11.225 --> 21:13.438
Sure, Greg could've made it home,

21:13.463 --> 21:15.485
but getting inside
without anyone noticing...

21:15.510 --> 21:16.929
That's another thing.

21:16.964 --> 21:20.099
The Prices installed an alarm
system when Owen was around 7.

21:20.133 --> 21:22.411
It chimed whenever
an exterior door was opened.

21:22.436 --> 21:25.238
To keep Owen from running away.
Penny mentioned it in her vlog.

21:25.272 --> 21:27.185
The prosecution used
the alarm system log

21:27.210 --> 21:28.607
to show that no one came into the house

21:28.632 --> 21:30.633
while Penny, Owen, Emily, and Eduardo,

21:30.658 --> 21:31.953
the home healthcare aide, were there.

21:31.978 --> 21:34.376
The log shows only one door
opening that afternoon

21:34.401 --> 21:36.100
before the ambulance arrived...
the back door,

21:36.125 --> 21:38.170
from 2:36 to 2:38.

21:38.195 --> 21:39.889
That was Eduardo
taking out the lunch trash.

21:39.914 --> 21:42.628
Maybe Greg slipped in the back
door when Eduardo was busy.

21:42.644 --> 21:44.689
Would two minutes be enough
for Greg to enter,

21:44.714 --> 21:46.087
inject Owen, and then leave?

21:46.112 --> 21:47.345
Only one way to find out.

21:47.370 --> 21:49.862
Frankie and Tess, go to the Price house.

21:56.068 --> 21:57.879
Jackson send you
with interview questions?

21:57.904 --> 21:59.574
I'm here for an update on Penny Price.

21:59.599 --> 22:02.535
I just had lunch with the head
of the Women's Legal Collective.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.857
She's keeping a close eye on the case.

22:03.882 --> 22:05.666
We're exploring other possibilities,

22:05.700 --> 22:07.634
but Penny's far from in the clear.

22:07.669 --> 22:09.717
How you holding up?

22:10.514 --> 22:12.730
You can tell Morrison Family HQ that...

22:12.755 --> 22:14.277
I wasn't asking for them.

22:14.302 --> 22:16.683
I'm asking... as a friend.

22:16.708 --> 22:18.489
Hardly my favorite position.

22:18.514 --> 22:19.894
Luckily, I'm flexible.

22:19.919 --> 22:21.453
But you knew that.

22:24.485 --> 22:27.060
[Laughing] And I don't know
why I just flirted with you.

22:27.085 --> 22:28.589
Old habits.

22:28.623 --> 22:30.560
- Also, I'm very handsome.
- Mm.

22:30.585 --> 22:34.088
Maybe after this interview is over
and this crisis is behind us,

22:34.588 --> 22:37.268
there are some other habits
we can keep alive.

22:37.861 --> 22:39.730
That's not the worst idea.

22:41.044 --> 22:42.669
Looking forward to it.

22:48.503 --> 22:50.908
On the day Owen died,
Greg knew the routine.

22:50.933 --> 22:53.136
Eduardo set off the door chimes
as he steps outside

22:53.161 --> 22:55.385
to take out the trash,
Greg slips inside.

22:55.410 --> 22:56.922
Two minutes on the timer.

22:57.711 --> 22:58.914
Go.

22:59.414 --> 23:01.545
Greg waits for Eduardo to step outside,

23:01.570 --> 23:03.490
- [Doorbell chimes]
- and then enters the house.

23:13.014 --> 23:15.381
Penny was in the den
recording a new vlog.

23:18.498 --> 23:20.574
Emily was doing homework in her room.

23:20.599 --> 23:24.811
Greg slipped past Penny
and Emily, headed upstairs.

23:32.313 --> 23:34.147
Owen notices his dad.

23:38.140 --> 23:40.185
He's even happy to see him.

23:53.627 --> 23:55.542
And that's when he does it.

24:03.714 --> 24:05.919
Greg rushes to the back door.

24:06.924 --> 24:07.900
Stop!

24:07.925 --> 24:09.589
[Doorbell chimes]

24:09.778 --> 24:11.558
Greg had time to administer the dose,

24:11.583 --> 24:13.989
but by now Eduardo
would have closed the door.

24:15.019 --> 24:17.921
Greg ducks into the kitchen.

24:27.765 --> 24:31.234
Eduardo calls 9-1-1,
and Greg Price waits

24:31.269 --> 24:34.810
for four long minutes
while his son dies.

24:36.240 --> 24:38.675
The paramedics race in
and leave the door open behind them.

24:38.710 --> 24:40.232
Greg slips out.

24:43.081 --> 24:44.181
What's up?

24:44.215 --> 24:45.916
If Greg walked out the front door,

24:45.950 --> 24:47.684
he would have been seen
by all the neighbors

24:47.719 --> 24:49.627
who came out when
they heard the ambulance.

24:56.401 --> 24:57.807
You okay?

24:58.682 --> 25:00.011
Greg didn't kill Owen,

25:00.036 --> 25:02.807
and we can't seem to find
anything that rules out Penny.

25:03.392 --> 25:06.194

that Penny killed her son.

doesn't mean that Penny's guilty.

The problem is we don't know
where he's commenting from.

- Draft a subpoena.

No, but CIU does, and a full
