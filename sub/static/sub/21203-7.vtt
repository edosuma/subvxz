WEBVTT

00:08.047 --> 00:11.004
Little Theon! Come and get her.

00:19.088 --> 00:22.628
It's an invitation...
to King's Landing.

00:22.629 --> 00:24.128
You will represent my interests

00:24.129 --> 00:25.753
at this gathering
as you see them.

00:25.754 --> 00:28.213
It's not safe leaving you
with Littlefinger.

00:28.420 --> 00:29.921
She's your sister.

00:30.296 --> 00:31.712
Arya would never betray
her family.

00:31.921 --> 00:34.441
She would if she
thought I was going to betray Jon.

00:37.545 --> 00:39.629
With the faces,
I can become someone else.

00:40.213 --> 00:44.213
I wonder what it would feel like
to be the Lady of Winterfell.

00:44.879 --> 00:50.088
All I'd need to find out...
is your face.

00:53.545 --> 00:55.045
Daenerys will win this war.

00:55.046 --> 00:56.503
If you want Cersei
to bend the knee,

00:56.504 --> 00:57.504
you can ask her yourself.

00:57.505 --> 00:59.545
She has
a more important request.

01:00.420 --> 01:02.087
Cersei thinks the army
of the dead is nothing

01:02.088 --> 01:04.379
but a story.
What if we prove her wrong?

01:04.921 --> 01:06.544
Bring the dead to her.

01:12.962 --> 01:13.962
Go!

01:19.921 --> 01:22.420
We are going to destroy
the Night King and his army.

01:23.004 --> 01:24.754
Thank you, my queen.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074

04:23.754 --> 04:25.961
- Oil?
- Pitch, my lord.

04:25.962 --> 04:28.504
- How many barrels?
- 500, my lord.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.586
Get 500 more.

04:32.587 --> 04:33.587
Yes, my lord.

04:46.046 --> 04:49.003
I still enjoy it
when they call me "my lord."

04:49.004 --> 04:51.461
The thrill will fade.

04:51.462 --> 04:52.962
If we live that long.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.170
Men without cocks.

04:56.171 --> 04:57.878
You wouldn't find me
fighting in an army

04:57.879 --> 04:59.836
if I had no cock.

04:59.837 --> 05:02.295
What's left
to fight for?

05:02.296 --> 05:04.170
Gold?

05:04.171 --> 05:06.003
I spent my life
around soldiers.

05:06.004 --> 05:08.129
What do you think
they spend that gold on?

05:09.670 --> 05:11.337
Family.

05:11.338 --> 05:13.004
Not without a cock,
you don't.

05:14.379 --> 05:17.171
Maybe it really is
all cocks in the end.

05:19.254 --> 05:22.544
Yet, your brother has chosen
to side with the cockless.

05:22.545 --> 05:27.419
Yes, he's always been
a champion of the downtrodden.

06:05.629 --> 06:08.379
I think we're about to be
the downtrodden.

06:10.338 --> 06:12.795
Archers, stand tall!

06:12.796 --> 06:15.754
Cover that wall!

06:43.213 --> 06:46.795
- How many people live here?
- A million, give or take.

06:46.796 --> 06:50.920
That's more people than the
entire North crammed into that.

06:50.921 --> 06:53.087
Why would anyone
want to live that way?

06:53.088 --> 06:55.544
There's more work
in the city.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.754
And the brothels
are far superior.

07:36.088 --> 07:38.128
Why isn't she with them?

07:38.129 --> 07:40.295
I'm afraid I don't know,
Your Grace.

07:40.296 --> 07:42.461
No one has seen her.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.128
And the rest of them?

07:44.129 --> 07:46.378
They're on their way
to the Dragonpit now.

07:46.379 --> 07:47.670
Including our brother?

07:49.338 --> 07:50.462
Yes, Your Grace.

07:54.796 --> 07:56.295
If anything goes wrong,

07:56.296 --> 07:58.337
kill the silver-haired
bitch first,

07:58.338 --> 08:01.628
then our brother, then the
bastard who calls himself king.

08:01.629 --> 08:04.670
The rest of them you can kill
in any order you see fit.

08:06.088 --> 08:07.461
Come, Ser Gregor.

08:07.462 --> 08:09.629
It's time for us
to meet our guests.

08:18.379 --> 08:20.544
Why did they build it?

08:20.545 --> 08:22.170
Dragons don't understand
the difference

08:22.171 --> 08:24.378
between what is theirs
and what isn't.

08:24.379 --> 08:28.045
Land, livestock,
children...

08:28.046 --> 08:30.586
Letting them roam free
around a city was a problem.

08:30.587 --> 08:34.378
I imagine it was
a sad joke at the end.

08:34.379 --> 08:37.836
An entire arena for a few sickly
creatures smaller than dogs.

08:37.837 --> 08:41.337
But in the beginning, when it
was home to Balerion the Dread,

08:41.337 --> 08:44.712
it must have been the most
dangerous place in the world.

08:50.379 --> 08:53.046
Maybe it still is.

09:01.504 --> 09:03.046
Welcome, my lords.

09:06.129 --> 09:09.087
Your friends arrived
before you did.

09:09.088 --> 09:11.962
I've been sent to escort
you all to the meeting.

09:35.420 --> 09:38.419
A pleasant surprise
in an unpleasant situation.

09:38.420 --> 09:41.087
I never thought I'd see
you again, my lord.

09:41.088 --> 09:42.628
Supporting the enemy,
no less.

09:42.629 --> 09:45.379
- Hard to blame you.
- Cersei will anyway.

09:46.670 --> 09:48.087
I'm glad you're alive.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.337
Come on!

09:49.338 --> 09:50.796
You can suck
his magic cock later.

09:58.462 --> 09:59.837
What's in there?

10:01.171 --> 10:02.629
Fuck off.

10:12.296 --> 10:13.961
I thought
you were dead.

10:13.962 --> 10:16.128
Not yet.

10:16.129 --> 10:18.462
You came pretty close.

10:19.796 --> 10:22.420
I was only trying
to protect her.

10:23.837 --> 10:25.711
You and me both.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.628
She's alive.

10:27.629 --> 10:28.796
Arya.

10:31.129 --> 10:33.670
- Where?
- Winterfell.

10:35.670 --> 10:38.669
Who's protecting her
if you're here?

10:38.670 --> 10:40.170
The only one
that needs protecting

10:40.171 --> 10:42.504
is the one that gets
in her way.

10:45.379 --> 10:47.046
It won't be me.

10:50.171 --> 10:52.253
Here we are...

10:52.254 --> 10:54.795
the heroes of Blackwater Bay.

10:54.796 --> 10:56.378
Strange place for a reunion.

10:56.379 --> 10:58.253
It is, my lord.

10:58.254 --> 11:01.337
I don't think I'm anyone's
lord anymore, Podrick.

11:01.338 --> 11:03.920
Save the titles for
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater.

11:03.921 --> 11:06.836
I'm sure your new queen will
be happy to restore yours

11:06.837 --> 11:08.295
if she ends up
on the throne.

11:08.296 --> 11:10.419
You've been thinking
about our new queen?

11:10.420 --> 11:14.753
Perhaps you've been
reconsidering your allegiances.

11:14.754 --> 11:16.795
Remember my offer...

11:16.796 --> 11:20.212
whatever they're paying you,
I'll pay double.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.753
And that would be
double what now, exactly?

11:22.754 --> 11:25.295
Don't you worry about me.
I'm doing all right.

11:25.296 --> 11:27.628
- Looking after myself.
- Are you?

11:27.629 --> 11:29.087
Helping me to arrange
this meeting

11:29.088 --> 11:31.544
wasn't exactly looking
after yourself, was it?

11:31.545 --> 11:33.337
You put yourself
at risk.

11:33.338 --> 11:36.212
I put yourself at risk.
Important difference.

11:36.213 --> 11:39.711
It's your head Queen Cersei's offered
a bag of gold for, it's not mine.

11:39.712 --> 11:41.503
Now, thanks to me,

11:41.504 --> 11:44.711
she's got two traitors' heads
coming right through her door.

11:44.712 --> 11:47.170
She can lop them both off
as soon as she gets tired

11:47.171 --> 11:50.045
of the clever words that
pour out their pieholes.

11:50.046 --> 11:53.253
All thanks to Ser Bronn
of the fucking Blackwater.

11:53.254 --> 11:56.545
If that's not looking after
myself, I don't know what is.

11:58.254 --> 11:59.587
It's good
to see you again.

12:02.545 --> 12:04.046
Yeah, you, too.

12:12.921 --> 12:16.754
Anyone touches it,
I'll kill you first.

13:15.004 --> 13:16.419
Come on, Pod.

13:16.420 --> 13:17.920
Let's you and me
go have a drink

13:17.921 --> 13:19.462
while the fancy folks
talk, eh?

13:48.670 --> 13:50.503
I left this shit city

13:50.504 --> 13:53.337
because I didn't
want to die in it.

13:53.338 --> 13:55.629
Am I going to die
in this shit city?

13:56.712 --> 13:57.795
You might.

13:57.796 --> 14:01.212
And this is all
your idea.

14:01.213 --> 14:04.544
Seems every bad idea has some
Lannister cunt behind it.

14:04.545 --> 14:07.711
And some Clegane cunt
to help them see it through.

15:07.504 --> 15:09.419
Remember me?

15:09.420 --> 15:11.337
Yeah, you do.

15:11.338 --> 15:15.419
You're even fucking
uglier than I am now.

15:15.420 --> 15:17.921
What did they do
to you?

15:19.213 --> 15:21.253
Doesn't matter.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.461
That's not how it ends
for you, brother.

15:23.462 --> 15:26.711
You know who's
coming for you.

15:26.712 --> 15:28.796
You've always known.

15:43.338 --> 15:44.338
Where is she?

15:45.754 --> 15:46.878
She'll be here soon.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.129
Didn't travel with you?

15:50.004 --> 15:51.004
No.

17:45.921 --> 17:47.920
We've been here
for some time.

17:47.921 --> 17:50.213
My apologies.

17:59.504 --> 18:01.170
We are all facing a unique...

18:01.171 --> 18:03.212
Theon!

18:03.213 --> 18:05.128
I have your sister.

18:05.129 --> 18:07.545
If you don't submit
to me here, now...

18:08.962 --> 18:10.338
I'll kill her.

18:16.088 --> 18:18.544
I think we ought to begin
with larger concerns.

18:18.545 --> 18:20.753
Then why
are you talking?

18:20.754 --> 18:22.962
You're the smallest
concern here.

18:24.587 --> 18:27.212
Do you remember when we
discussed dwarf jokes?

18:27.213 --> 18:28.961
His wasn't even good.

18:28.962 --> 18:30.295
He explained it
at the end.

18:30.296 --> 18:31.836
Never explain.
It always ruins it.

18:31.837 --> 18:33.337
We don't even
let your kind live

18:33.338 --> 18:36.544
in the Iron Islands,
you know?

18:36.545 --> 18:38.753
We kill you at birth.

18:38.754 --> 18:40.795
An act of mercy
for the parents.

18:40.796 --> 18:43.461
Perhaps you ought
to sit down.

18:43.462 --> 18:44.920
Why?

18:44.921 --> 18:47.129
Sit down or leave.

19:05.879 --> 19:11.337
We are a group of people
who do not like one another,

19:11.338 --> 19:13.879
as this recent
demonstration has shown.

19:15.379 --> 19:17.669
We have suffered
at each other's hands.

19:17.670 --> 19:21.045
We have lost people we love
at each other's hands.

19:21.046 --> 19:23.337
If all we wanted
was more of the same,

19:23.338 --> 19:25.586
there would be no need
for this gathering.

19:25.587 --> 19:28.628
We are entirely capable of
waging war against each other

19:28.629 --> 19:30.337
without meeting
face-to-face.

19:30.338 --> 19:32.212
So instead, we should
settle our differences

19:32.213 --> 19:34.878
and live together in harmony
for the rest of our days?

19:34.879 --> 19:36.295
We all know
that will never happen.

19:36.296 --> 19:37.670
Then why are we here?

19:40.004 --> 19:43.046
This isn't about
living in harmony.

19:44.545 --> 19:46.337
It's just
about living.

19:46.338 --> 19:48.920
The same thing
is coming for all of us.

19:48.921 --> 19:50.961
A general you can't
negotiate with.

19:50.962 --> 19:54.711
An army that doesn't leave corpses
behind on the battlefield.

19:54.712 --> 19:58.295
Lord Tyrion tells me a million
people live in this city.

19:58.296 --> 20:01.711
They're about to become a million more
soldiers in the Army of the Dead.

20:01.712 --> 20:04.420
I imagine for most of them
it would be an improvement.

20:08.587 --> 20:10.004
This is serious.

20:11.462 --> 20:13.170
I wouldn't be here
if it weren't.

20:13.171 --> 20:15.003
I don't think
it's serious at all.

20:15.004 --> 20:16.461
I think it's
another bad joke.

20:16.462 --> 20:19.212
If my brother Jaime
has informed me correctly,

20:19.213 --> 20:20.836
you're asking me
for a truce.

20:20.837 --> 20:23.379
Yes.
That's all.

20:25.088 --> 20:26.462
That's all?

20:27.837 --> 20:29.419
Pull back my armies
and stand down

20:29.420 --> 20:31.128
while you go
on your monster hunt.

20:31.129 --> 20:33.711
Or while you solidify
and expand your position.

20:33.712 --> 20:38.087
Hard for me to know which it
is with my armies pulled back

20:38.088 --> 20:41.753
until you return and march on my
capital with four times the men.

20:41.754 --> 20:46.088
Your capital will be safe until the
northern threat is dealt with.

20:47.504 --> 20:48.795
You have my word.

20:48.796 --> 20:50.920
The word of
a would-be usurper.

20:50.921 --> 20:52.920
There is no conversation

20:52.921 --> 20:56.961
that will erase
the last 50 years.

20:56.962 --> 20:59.171
We have something
to show you.

23:14.670 --> 23:17.254
We can destroy them
by burning them.

23:26.837 --> 23:30.254
And we can destroy them
with dragonglass.

23:32.296 --> 23:34.087
If we don't win
this fight,

23:34.088 --> 23:38.088
then that is the fate
of every person in the world.

23:55.754 --> 23:57.961
There is only one war
that matters...

23:57.962 --> 24:00.296
the Great War.

24:01.420 --> 24:02.796
And it is here.

24:07.004 --> 24:09.129
I didn't believe
it until I saw them.

24:11.420 --> 24:12.796
I saw them all.

24:15.504 --> 24:16.711
How many?

24:16.712 --> 24:18.129
A hundred thousand,
at least.

24:34.879 --> 24:36.338
Can they swim?

24:37.504 --> 24:38.628
No.

24:38.629 --> 24:40.004
Good.

24:41.754 --> 24:44.503
I'm taking the Iron Fleet
back to the Iron Islands.

24:44.504 --> 24:46.586
What are you
talking about?

24:46.587 --> 24:48.503
I've been
around the world.

24:48.504 --> 24:50.878
I've seen everything,
things you couldn't imagine,

24:50.879 --> 24:52.338
and this...

24:54.712 --> 24:58.129
this is the only thing I've
ever seen that terrifies me.

25:05.462 --> 25:07.378
I'm going back
to my island.

25:07.379 --> 25:10.045
You should go
back to yours.

25:10.046 --> 25:12.003
When winter's over,

25:12.004 --> 25:14.670
we'll be the only ones
left alive.

25:24.129 --> 25:26.171
He's right to be afraid.

25:27.462 --> 25:29.128
And a coward to run.

25:29.129 --> 25:31.378
If those things
come for us,

25:31.379 --> 25:33.295
there will be
no kingdoms to rule.

25:33.296 --> 25:35.711
Everything we suffered
will have been for nothing.

25:35.712 --> 25:38.504
Everything we lost
will have been for nothing.

25:40.254 --> 25:42.046
The crown accepts
your truce.

25:44.379 --> 25:48.420
Until the dead are defeated,
they are the true enemy.

25:57.254 --> 26:00.254
In return, the King in the
North will extend this truce.

26:02.462 --> 26:04.461
He will remain in the North
where he belongs.

26:04.462 --> 26:06.378
He will not take up arms
against the Lannisters.

26:06.379 --> 26:08.795
He will not
choose sides.

26:08.796 --> 26:11.087
Just the
King in the North?

26:11.088 --> 26:13.544
Not me?

26:13.545 --> 26:16.170
I would never
ask it of you.

26:16.171 --> 26:17.753
You would never
agree to it.

26:17.754 --> 26:20.254
And if you did, I would trust
you even less than I do now.

26:21.587 --> 26:24.503
I ask it only
of Ned Stark's son.

26:24.504 --> 26:28.046
I know Ned Stark's son
will be true to his word.

26:42.296 --> 26:45.003
I am true to my word.

26:45.004 --> 26:46.754
Or I try to be.

26:49.879 --> 26:52.462
That is why I cannot
give you what you ask.

26:53.796 --> 26:56.462
I cannot serve
two queens.

26:58.837 --> 27:00.253
And I have already
pledged myself

27:00.254 --> 27:04.004
to Queen Daenerys
of House Targaryen.

27:15.129 --> 27:17.711
Then there is
nothing left to discuss.

27:17.712 --> 27:20.711
The dead will come north first.
Enjoy dealing with them.

27:20.712 --> 27:22.712
We will deal with
whatever is left of you.

27:31.171 --> 27:32.836
Ser Jaime.

27:32.837 --> 27:34.295
It's been good
to see you.

27:34.296 --> 27:36.295
I imagine the next time
will be across a battlefield.

27:36.296 --> 27:37.878
We both saw
what just happened.

27:37.879 --> 27:39.628
We both saw
that... thing.

27:39.629 --> 27:42.419
Yes, and I'm not looking forward
to seeing more of them.

27:42.420 --> 27:44.087
But I'm loyal
to the queen,

27:44.088 --> 27:46.003
and you're loyal to Sansa
and her dolt brother.

27:46.004 --> 27:48.128
Oh, fuck loyalty!

27:48.129 --> 27:49.669
Fuck loyalty?

27:49.670 --> 27:53.212
This goes beyond houses
and honor and oaths.

27:53.213 --> 27:54.712
Talk to the queen.

28:00.338 --> 28:01.712
And tell her what?

28:12.545 --> 28:14.213
I wish you
hadn't done that.

28:18.379 --> 28:21.378
I'm grateful
for your loyalty,

28:21.379 --> 28:25.461
but my dragon died
so that we could be here.

28:25.462 --> 28:27.878
If it's all for nothing,

28:27.879 --> 28:30.045
then he died
for nothing.

28:30.046 --> 28:31.544
I know!

28:31.545 --> 28:34.212
I'm pleased you bent
the knee to our queen.

28:34.213 --> 28:36.920
I would have advised
it, had you asked.

28:36.921 --> 28:38.878
But have you
ever considered

28:38.879 --> 28:41.087
learning how to lie
every now and then?

28:41.088 --> 28:42.088
Just a bit?

28:43.629 --> 28:46.462
I'm not going to swear
an oath I can't uphold.

28:47.837 --> 28:49.419
Talk about my father
if you want,

28:49.420 --> 28:52.503
tell me that's the attitude
that got him killed.

28:52.504 --> 28:55.586
But when enough people
make false promises,

28:55.587 --> 28:58.753
words stop meaning
anything.

28:58.754 --> 29:01.920
Then there are no more answers,
only better and better lies.

29:01.921 --> 29:04.669
And lies won't help us
in this fight.

29:04.670 --> 29:06.753
That is indeed a problem.

29:06.754 --> 29:10.296
The more immediate problem
is that we're fucked.

29:11.504 --> 29:12.920
Any ideas
as to how we might

29:12.921 --> 29:14.921
change that state
of affairs?

29:16.296 --> 29:17.753
Only one.

29:17.754 --> 29:20.170
Everyone stays here,

29:20.171 --> 29:22.961
and I go and talk
to my sister.

29:22.962 --> 29:27.378
I didn't come all this way
to have my Hand murdered.

29:27.379 --> 29:29.170
I don't want Cersei
to murder me either.

29:29.171 --> 29:32.170
I could have stayed in my cell and
saved a great deal of trouble.

29:32.171 --> 29:34.212
I did this.

29:34.213 --> 29:36.711
- I should go.
- She'll definitely murder you.

29:36.712 --> 29:40.088
I go see
my sister alone.

29:41.587 --> 29:43.087
Or we all go home

29:43.088 --> 29:44.837
and we're right back
where we started.

30:46.712 --> 30:51.045
- You spoke with her?
- At her until she kicked me out.

30:51.046 --> 30:54.128
She thinks I was an
idiot to trust you.

30:54.129 --> 30:56.253
A lot of people seem to
think that, actually.

30:56.254 --> 30:57.878
I'm about to step
into a room

30:57.879 --> 30:59.669
with the most murderous
woman in the world

30:59.670 --> 31:03.586
who's already tried to kill
me twice, that I know of.

31:03.587 --> 31:05.213
Who's an idiot?

31:08.629 --> 31:11.087
I suppose we should
say goodbye,

31:11.088 --> 31:12.670
one idiot to another.

32:11.629 --> 32:13.503
I shouldn't be
surprised, I suppose.

32:13.504 --> 32:15.295
She's your kind of woman...

32:15.296 --> 32:17.836
a foreign whore who
doesn't know her place.

32:17.837 --> 32:21.628
A foreign whore you can't
abduct, beat, or intimidate.

32:21.629 --> 32:23.337
That must be
difficult for you.

32:23.338 --> 32:25.795
So you bring her here
with her pet Northerner,

32:25.796 --> 32:27.711
- whom you've convinced to bow down before her.
- I didn't know about that.

32:27.712 --> 32:29.795
And now you've got them both
working towards the same goal,

32:29.796 --> 32:31.920
the goal you've worked
towards your entire life...

32:31.921 --> 32:35.003
- Cersei, I didn't know.
- ...the destruction of this family.

32:35.004 --> 32:38.337
I am the one preventing
that from happening.

32:38.338 --> 32:40.878
Daenerys didn't want
to debate and negotiate.

32:40.879 --> 32:42.337
She didn't want
to bring you words.

32:42.338 --> 32:44.295
She wanted to bring you
fire and blood

32:44.296 --> 32:46.419
until I advised her
otherwise.

32:46.420 --> 32:48.212
I don't want
to destroy our family.

32:48.213 --> 32:50.170
I never have.

32:50.171 --> 32:51.628
You killed our father.

32:51.629 --> 32:53.253
After he sentenced me
to death

32:53.254 --> 32:55.836
for a crime I didn't
commit, yes, I killed him.

32:55.837 --> 32:57.503
Hate me for it
if you want.

32:57.504 --> 32:59.836
I hate myself for it
in spite of what he was,

32:59.837 --> 33:02.295
in spite of
what he did to me.

33:02.296 --> 33:04.045
Oh, poor little man.

33:04.046 --> 33:05.753
Your papa
was mean to you.

33:05.754 --> 33:09.795
Do you have any idea what you did
when you fired that crossbow?

33:09.796 --> 33:11.628
You left us open.

33:11.629 --> 33:13.212
You laid us bare
for the vultures,

33:13.213 --> 33:16.753
and the vultures came
and tore us apart.

33:16.754 --> 33:18.419
You may not
have killed Joffrey,

33:18.420 --> 33:20.337
but you killed Myrcella,
you killed Tommen.

33:20.338 --> 33:22.378
No one would've touched them
if Father was here.

33:22.379 --> 33:24.961
- No one would have dared...
- I have never been more sorry about anything.

33:24.962 --> 33:26.669
I will not hear it,
not from you.

33:26.670 --> 33:28.420
I will not hear it!

33:31.379 --> 33:33.711
All right.

33:33.712 --> 33:35.170
You love your family,

33:35.171 --> 33:38.253
and I have
destroyed it.

33:38.254 --> 33:41.003
I will always
be a threat.

33:41.004 --> 33:42.338
So put an end to me.

33:51.171 --> 33:53.378
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a mother.

33:53.379 --> 33:56.128
If it weren't for me,
you'd have a father.

33:56.129 --> 33:57.461
If it weren't for me,

33:57.462 --> 33:59.544
you'd have
two beautiful children.

33:59.545 --> 34:01.711
I've thought
about killing you

34:01.712 --> 34:03.379
more times
than I can count.

34:05.088 --> 34:07.379
Do it!
Say the word.

35:16.171 --> 35:19.295
I am more sorry about the children
than you could ever know.

35:19.296 --> 35:22.461
- I will not...
- I don't care. I loved them.

35:22.462 --> 35:24.337
You know I did.

35:24.338 --> 35:27.837
You know it in your heart if
there's anything left of it.

35:29.962 --> 35:31.670
It doesn't matter.

35:33.629 --> 35:37.253
Your love doesn't matter.
Your feelings don't matter.

35:37.254 --> 35:39.419
I don't care
why you did what you did.

35:39.420 --> 35:42.295
I only care
what it cost us.

35:42.296 --> 35:43.670
It cost us our future.

35:45.338 --> 35:47.461
If there's no future,
then why are we here?

35:47.462 --> 35:49.461
Why did you
allow me to come?

35:49.462 --> 35:52.503
Not to help my enemies
collaborate in my destruction.

35:52.504 --> 35:54.253
Yes, no,
not what you hoped for,

35:54.254 --> 35:56.796
but you must have
hoped for something.

35:57.837 --> 36:00.378
What did you hope for?

36:00.379 --> 36:04.045
- To make Jon Snow submit to your queen?
- Mm, not like this.

36:04.046 --> 36:06.419
But eventually, you want everyone
to bend the knee to her.

36:06.420 --> 36:08.170
- Yes.
- Why?

36:08.171 --> 36:09.753
Because I think

36:09.754 --> 36:11.586
she will make the world
a better place.

36:11.587 --> 36:13.504
You said she'd destroy
King's Landing.

36:15.712 --> 36:17.628
She knows herself.

36:17.629 --> 36:19.170
She chose an advisor

36:19.171 --> 36:22.503
who would check her worst
impulses instead of feeding them.

36:22.504 --> 36:24.503
That's the difference
between you.

36:24.504 --> 36:26.711
I don't care about
checking my worst impulses.

36:26.712 --> 36:29.337
I don't care about making
the world a better place.

36:29.338 --> 36:31.128
Hang the world.

36:31.129 --> 36:33.586
That thing
you dragged here,

36:33.587 --> 36:37.045
I know what it is,
I know what it means.

36:37.046 --> 36:39.253
And when it came at me,
I didn't think about the world.

36:39.254 --> 36:41.337
Not at all.

36:41.338 --> 36:42.920
As soon as
it opened its mouth,

36:42.921 --> 36:44.295
the world
disappeared for me,

36:44.296 --> 36:46.419
right down
its black throat.

36:46.420 --> 36:48.795
All I could think about was
keeping those gnashing teeth

36:48.796 --> 36:50.337
away from the ones
who matter most,

36:50.338 --> 36:52.128
away from my family.

36:52.129 --> 36:55.753
Maybe Euron Greyjoy
had the right idea.

36:55.754 --> 36:58.544
Get on a boat,
take those who matter...

36:58.545 --> 36:59.712
You're pregnant.

37:32.171 --> 37:34.878
No one is less happy
about this than I am.

37:34.879 --> 37:36.296
I know.

37:38.962 --> 37:41.461
I respect
what you did.

37:41.462 --> 37:43.796
Wish you hadn't done it,
but I respect it.

37:54.462 --> 37:57.962
This place was the beginning
of the end for my family.

38:04.171 --> 38:06.296
A dragon
is not a slave.

38:09.129 --> 38:11.586
They were terrifying.

38:11.587 --> 38:13.296
Extraordinary.

38:14.712 --> 38:17.753
They filled people
with wonder and awe,

38:17.754 --> 38:20.004
and we locked them
in here.

38:21.296 --> 38:22.837
They wasted away.

38:24.046 --> 38:26.337
They grew small.

38:26.338 --> 38:28.962
And we grew small
as well.

38:30.296 --> 38:32.878
We weren't extraordinary
without them.

38:32.879 --> 38:34.712
We were just like
everyone else.

38:39.754 --> 38:41.670
You're not like
everyone else.

38:47.545 --> 38:50.004
And your family
hasn't seen its end.

38:51.171 --> 38:52.795
You're still here.

38:52.796 --> 38:55.337
I can't
have children.

38:55.338 --> 38:56.920
Who told you that?

38:56.921 --> 38:59.878
The witch who
murdered my husband.

38:59.879 --> 39:02.087
Has it occurred to you
she might not have been

39:02.088 --> 39:03.879
a reliable source
of information?

39:09.712 --> 39:11.836
You were right
from the beginning.

39:11.837 --> 39:15.046
If I had trusted you,
everything would be different.

39:19.129 --> 39:20.545
So, what now?

39:24.462 --> 39:27.045
I can't forget what I saw
north of the Wall.

39:27.046 --> 39:28.961
And I can't pretend
that Cersei

39:28.962 --> 39:32.254
won't take back half the country
the moment I march north.

39:34.379 --> 39:36.879
It appears Tyrion's
assessment was correct.

39:39.296 --> 39:40.379
We're fucked.

40:33.545 --> 40:35.629
My armies will not
stand down.

40:37.088 --> 40:39.171
I will not pull them
back to the capital.

40:42.962 --> 40:46.462
I will march them north to fight
alongside you in the Great War.

40:48.545 --> 40:50.462
The darkness
is coming for us all.

40:52.254 --> 40:55.212
We'll face it together.

40:55.213 --> 40:58.003
And when
the Great War is over,

40:58.004 --> 41:01.337
perhaps you'll remember
I chose to help

41:01.338 --> 41:04.796
with no promises or
assurances from any of you.

41:08.171 --> 41:10.213
I expect not.

41:12.629 --> 41:14.378
Call our banners.

41:14.379 --> 41:15.879
All of them.

41:28.879 --> 41:32.128
It's not easy for
ravens to fly in these storms.

41:32.129 --> 41:34.128
Perhaps Jon tried
to send word earlier.

41:34.129 --> 41:37.544
No, this is
the way he is,

41:37.545 --> 41:39.920
the way
he's always been.

41:39.921 --> 41:42.544
He never asked for my opinion.
Why would he start now?

41:42.545 --> 41:46.295
I can't believe he'd surrender the
Northern crown without consulting you.

41:46.296 --> 41:48.711
This is his writing,
his signature.

41:48.712 --> 41:51.878
He pledged to fight
for Daenerys Targaryen.

41:51.879 --> 41:53.961
He's bent the knee.

41:53.962 --> 41:56.544
I've heard gossip

41:56.545 --> 42:00.544
that the Dragon Queen
is quite beautiful.

42:00.545 --> 42:02.754
What does that have to do
with anything?

42:05.046 --> 42:07.795
Jon is young
and unmarried.

42:07.796 --> 42:10.003
Daenerys is young
and unmarried.

42:10.004 --> 42:12.961
You think he wants
to marry her?

42:12.962 --> 42:16.212
An alliance
makes sense.

42:16.213 --> 42:18.420
Together, they'd be
difficult to defeat.

42:20.046 --> 42:23.046
He was named
King in the North.

42:25.462 --> 42:26.879
He can be unnamed.

42:30.712 --> 42:33.378
Even if I wanted to,
Arya would never go along.

42:33.379 --> 42:36.212
She always loved Jon far
more than she ever loved me,

42:36.213 --> 42:39.419
and she'd kill anyone
who betrayed her family.

42:39.420 --> 42:41.420
You are family, too.

42:43.420 --> 42:46.003
Would Arya really murder
her own sister?

42:46.004 --> 42:48.337
Do you know
what she is now?

42:48.338 --> 42:51.711
Do you know what
the Faceless Men are?

42:51.712 --> 42:53.920
Only by reputation.

42:53.921 --> 42:57.087
They worship the God
of Death, I believe.

42:57.088 --> 42:59.711
I never trust
godly men.

42:59.712 --> 43:01.212
They're killers.

43:01.213 --> 43:03.088
And Arya
was one of them.

43:07.962 --> 43:09.544
What do you think
she's after?

43:09.545 --> 43:12.128
She's your sister.

43:12.129 --> 43:14.254
You know her far better
than I ever could.

43:17.796 --> 43:22.544
Sometimes when I try to
understand a person's motives,

43:22.545 --> 43:24.462
I play a little game.

43:26.962 --> 43:28.962
I assume the worst.

43:31.962 --> 43:34.795
What's the worst reason
they could possibly have

43:34.796 --> 43:39.753
for saying what they say
and doing what they do?

43:39.754 --> 43:41.961
Then I ask myself,

43:41.962 --> 43:45.128
"How well does
that reason explain

43:45.129 --> 43:48.088
what they say
and what they do?"

43:49.921 --> 43:51.461
So, tell me...

43:51.462 --> 43:54.004
what's the worst thing
she could want?

43:58.837 --> 44:01.836
She could
want me dead

44:01.837 --> 44:05.045
because she thinks
I wronged my family.

44:05.046 --> 44:07.338
Why did she come
to Winterfell?

44:10.545 --> 44:12.503
To kill me

44:12.504 --> 44:16.337
for marrying our enemies
and betraying my family.

44:16.338 --> 44:19.338
Why did she unearth the
letter Cersei made you write?

44:22.046 --> 44:26.128
To provide proof
of my betrayals.

44:26.129 --> 44:30.878
To provide justification
after she murders me.

44:30.879 --> 44:34.544
And after
she murders you,

44:34.545 --> 44:37.213
what does she become?

44:42.712 --> 44:44.420
Lady of Winterfell.

44:59.462 --> 45:02.378
If we have the Dothraki
ride hard on the kingsroad,

45:02.379 --> 45:05.045
they'll arrive at Winterfell
within the fortnight.

45:05.046 --> 45:06.544
And the Unsullied?

45:06.545 --> 45:08.170
We can sail with them
to White Harbor,

45:08.171 --> 45:10.878
meet the Dothraki here
on the kingsroad,

45:10.879 --> 45:13.836
then ride together
to Winterfell.

45:13.837 --> 45:17.087
Perhaps you should fly
to Winterfell, Your Grace.

45:17.088 --> 45:19.586
You have many enemies
in the North.

45:19.587 --> 45:21.836
Thousands fell
fighting your father.

45:21.837 --> 45:25.544
All it takes is one angry
man with a crossbow.

45:25.545 --> 45:27.753
He'll see your silver
hair on the kingsroad

45:27.754 --> 45:30.795
and know that one well-placed
bolt will make him a hero.

45:30.796 --> 45:33.420
The man who killed
the conqueror.

45:34.962 --> 45:36.753
It's your decision,
Your Grace.

45:36.754 --> 45:39.961
But if we're going to be
allies in this war,

45:39.962 --> 45:44.045
it's important for the
Northerners to see us as allies.

45:44.046 --> 45:47.212
If we sail
to White Harbor together,

45:47.213 --> 45:49.462
I think it sends
a better message.

45:55.921 --> 45:58.669
I've not come
to conquer the North.

45:58.670 --> 46:01.004
I'm coming to save
the North.

46:06.629 --> 46:07.962
We sail together.

46:23.129 --> 46:24.129
Jon.

46:26.296 --> 46:27.629
Can I speak
with you?

46:30.962 --> 46:32.088
All right.

46:37.962 --> 46:40.544
What you did
in King's Landing,

46:40.545 --> 46:42.670
what you said...

46:44.837 --> 46:48.253
you could've
lied to Cersei

46:48.254 --> 46:51.171
about bending the knee
to Daenerys.

46:55.171 --> 46:57.629
You risked everything
to tell an enemy the truth.

46:59.545 --> 47:02.003
We went down there
to make peace.

47:02.004 --> 47:05.503
And it seems to me we need
to be honest with each other

47:05.504 --> 47:06.879
if we're going
to fight together.

47:08.420 --> 47:10.879
You've always known
what was right.

47:14.379 --> 47:17.669
Even when we were all
young and stupid,

47:17.670 --> 47:19.170
you always knew.

47:19.171 --> 47:21.420
Every step you take...

47:22.879 --> 47:24.753
it's always
the right step.

47:24.754 --> 47:25.878
It's not.

47:25.879 --> 47:28.128
It may seem that way
from the outside,

47:28.129 --> 47:31.545
but I promise you,
it's not true.

47:33.962 --> 47:36.544
I've done plenty of
things that I regret.

47:36.545 --> 47:38.253
Not compared to me, you haven't.

47:38.254 --> 47:39.879
No.

47:41.712 --> 47:43.504
Not compared to you.

47:54.754 --> 47:57.379
I always wanted
to do the right thing.

48:00.046 --> 48:02.128
Be the right
kind of person.

48:02.129 --> 48:04.712
But I never knew
what that meant.

48:06.129 --> 48:08.462
It always seemed
like there's...

48:12.545 --> 48:14.962
like there was an impossible
choice I had to make.

48:17.420 --> 48:19.213
Stark or Greyjoy.

48:22.462 --> 48:27.087
Our father was more of a father
to you than yours ever was.

48:27.088 --> 48:29.920
- He was.
- And you betrayed him.

48:29.921 --> 48:31.795
Betrayed his memory.

48:31.796 --> 48:32.796
I did.

48:37.796 --> 48:39.545
But you never
lost him.

48:43.420 --> 48:45.504
He's a part of you.

48:47.046 --> 48:48.795
Just like
he's a part of me.

48:48.796 --> 48:50.962
But the things
I've done...

48:52.670 --> 48:55.420
It's not my place to
forgive you for all of it.

48:58.796 --> 49:02.003
But what I can
forgive,

49:02.004 --> 49:03.420
I do.

49:09.796 --> 49:11.962
You don't need
to choose.

49:13.296 --> 49:15.254
You're a Greyjoy...

49:17.462 --> 49:18.796
and you're a Stark.

49:32.504 --> 49:35.419
When I was
Ramsay's prisoner,

49:35.420 --> 49:39.461
Yara tried
to save me.

49:39.462 --> 49:43.003
She's the only one

49:43.004 --> 49:44.962
who tried to save me.

49:52.046 --> 49:54.212
She needs me now.

49:54.213 --> 49:57.004
So, why are you
still talking to me?

50:11.254 --> 50:12.711
Load up.

50:12.712 --> 50:14.337
Load up, lads.
Go on.

50:14.338 --> 50:16.670
Tide's coming in.

50:32.796 --> 50:35.379
All of us chose
to follow Yara.

50:37.837 --> 50:41.669
We left the Iron
Islands for Yara.

50:41.670 --> 50:44.504
She would never
leave one of us behind.

50:47.379 --> 50:49.087
We're not
leaving her behind.

50:49.088 --> 50:50.544
Your sister's dead.

50:50.545 --> 50:52.253
- She's not dead.
- She's dead.

50:52.254 --> 50:55.128
Even if Euron hasn't cut her
throat yet, she's dead.

50:55.129 --> 51:00.253
- She's our queen.
- She's your sister, and you left her to die.

51:00.254 --> 51:01.754
I did.

51:04.129 --> 51:07.003
I ran from my uncle.

51:07.004 --> 51:08.419
I was a coward.

51:08.420 --> 51:11.669
So, why in fuck's name
should we listen to you?

51:11.670 --> 51:15.295
They say the dead
can't swim.

51:15.296 --> 51:16.878
We're going
to sail east,

51:16.879 --> 51:19.253
find a nice,
quiet island,

51:19.254 --> 51:22.253
kill all the men, and take
their wives for ourselves.

51:22.254 --> 51:24.669
- We're done with all that.
- Who says we are?

51:24.670 --> 51:27.587
Yara did.
She made a pledge.

51:29.504 --> 51:32.669
We're going
to find her,

51:32.670 --> 51:35.462
and we're going
to set her free.

51:43.921 --> 51:47.003
Run away,
little Theon.

51:47.004 --> 51:48.962
It's what
you do best.

51:52.004 --> 51:53.795
He needs to shut his mouth.

52:00.629 --> 52:03.504
Hey!

52:05.545 --> 52:09.753
Oh, yes!

52:09.754 --> 52:12.504
That's more like it.

52:29.379 --> 52:30.379
Stay down...

52:31.629 --> 52:33.129
or I'll kill you!

52:43.670 --> 52:47.171
I said stay down
or I'll kill you!

54:00.088 --> 54:01.754
Not for me.

54:05.046 --> 54:06.503
For Yara!

54:06.504 --> 54:07.921
Yara!

54:53.504 --> 54:55.962
Have my sister brought
to the Great Hall.

55:41.420 --> 55:43.213
Are you sure
you want to do this?

55:46.046 --> 55:49.295
It's not what I want.
It's what honor demands.

55:49.296 --> 55:52.212
And what does honor demand?

55:52.213 --> 55:55.087
That I defend my family
from those who would harm us.

55:55.088 --> 55:58.712
That I defend the North from
those who would betray us.

56:00.962 --> 56:02.670
All right, then.

56:04.088 --> 56:05.379
Get on with it.

56:08.213 --> 56:10.378
You stand accused
of murder.

56:10.379 --> 56:13.212
You stand accused
of treason.

56:13.213 --> 56:16.004
How do you answer
these charges...

56:18.420 --> 56:20.254
Lord Baelish?

56:36.004 --> 56:37.545
My sister asked you
a question.

56:42.254 --> 56:43.754
Lady Sansa,
forgive me...

56:45.420 --> 56:47.212
I'm a bit confused.

56:47.213 --> 56:49.503
Which charges
confuse you?

56:49.504 --> 56:51.544
Let's start with
the simplest one...

56:51.545 --> 56:54.128
you murdered our aunt,
Lysa Arryn.

56:54.129 --> 56:57.003
You pushed her through the Moon
Door and watched her fall.

56:57.004 --> 56:58.879
Do you deny it?

57:00.921 --> 57:02.419
I did it
to protect you.

57:02.420 --> 57:04.461
You did it to take
power in the Vale.

57:04.462 --> 57:07.753
Earlier, you conspired
to murder Jon Arryn.

57:07.754 --> 57:10.253
You gave Lysa Tears of Lys
to poison him.

57:10.254 --> 57:11.296
Do you deny it?

57:13.629 --> 57:16.795
Whatever your aunt
might have told you...

57:16.796 --> 57:19.129
she was
a troubled woman.

57:20.462 --> 57:21.753
She imagined enemies
everywhere.

57:21.754 --> 57:24.128
You had Aunt Lysa send
a letter to our parents

57:24.129 --> 57:26.628
telling them it was the
Lannisters who murdered Jon Arryn

57:26.629 --> 57:28.128
when, really,
it was you.

57:28.129 --> 57:30.337
The conflict between
the Starks and the Lannisters,

57:30.338 --> 57:31.836
it was you
who started it.

57:31.837 --> 57:32.920
Do you deny it?

57:32.921 --> 57:34.544
I know
of no such letter.

57:34.545 --> 57:36.378
You conspired
with Cersei Lannister

57:36.379 --> 57:40.087
and Joffrey Baratheon to
betray our father, Ned Stark.

57:40.088 --> 57:42.628
Thanks to your treachery,
he was imprisoned

57:42.629 --> 57:46.087
and later executed on
false charges of treason.

57:46.088 --> 57:48.920
- Do you deny it?
- I deny it!

57:48.921 --> 57:52.295
None of you were there
to see what happened.

57:52.296 --> 57:54.253
None of you
knows the truth.

57:54.254 --> 57:56.171
You held a knife
to his throat.

58:01.379 --> 58:04.004
You said, "I did warn
you not the trust me."

58:07.338 --> 58:12.004
You told our mother this knife
belonged to Tyrion Lannister.

58:13.338 --> 58:15.212
But that was another
one of your lies.

58:15.213 --> 58:17.046
It was yours.

58:22.171 --> 58:25.087
Lady Sansa, I have known
you since you were a girl.

58:25.088 --> 58:27.753
- I've protected you.
- Protected me?

58:27.754 --> 58:29.879
By selling me
to the Boltons?

58:31.213 --> 58:33.544
If we could
speak alone,

58:33.545 --> 58:35.088
I can explain
everything.

58:37.296 --> 58:40.419
Sometimes when I'm trying to
understand a person's motives,

58:40.420 --> 58:43.003
I play a little game.

58:43.004 --> 58:44.670
I assume the worst.

58:46.046 --> 58:47.961
What's the worst
reason you have

58:47.962 --> 58:49.879
for turning me
against my sister?

58:51.712 --> 58:53.795
That's what you do,
isn't it?

58:53.796 --> 58:55.628
That's what
you've always done...

58:55.629 --> 58:57.461
turn family
against family,

58:57.462 --> 58:59.378
turn sister
against sister.

58:59.379 --> 59:01.586
That's what you did
to our mother and Aunt Lysa,

59:01.587 --> 59:03.795
and that's what
you tried to do to us.

59:03.796 --> 59:05.128
Sansa, please.

59:05.129 --> 59:08.961
I'm a slow learner,
it's true.

59:08.962 --> 59:10.419
But I learn.

59:10.420 --> 59:12.669
Give me a chance
to defend myself.

59:12.670 --> 59:13.962
I deserve that.

59:19.796 --> 59:21.378
I am Lord Protector
of the Vale

59:21.379 --> 59:23.753
and I command you to escort
me safely back to the Eyrie.

59:23.754 --> 59:25.046
I think not.

59:28.338 --> 59:31.046
Sansa, I beg you!

59:32.545 --> 59:34.586
I loved your mother since
the time I was a boy.

59:34.587 --> 59:36.379
And yet,
you betrayed her.

59:38.420 --> 59:41.586
I loved you.

59:41.587 --> 59:43.213
More than anyone.

59:44.338 --> 59:46.129
And yet,
you betrayed me.

59:48.754 --> 59:50.503
When you brought me
back to Winterfell,

59:50.504 --> 59:53.045
you told me there's no
justice in the world,

59:53.046 --> 59:55.254
not unless
we make it.

59:57.254 --> 01:00:01.669
Thank you for all your many
lessons, Lord Baelish.

01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:03.962
I will never
forget them.

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:08.670
Sansa!

01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:16.796
I...

01:00:39.879 --> 01:00:41.337
Our men in King's Landing

01:00:41.338 --> 01:00:43.003
will march north
in three days' time.

01:00:43.004 --> 01:00:44.378
It'll take us a fortnight

01:00:44.379 --> 01:00:45.711
just to gather supplies
for the train.

01:00:45.712 --> 01:00:47.253
We don't
have a fortnight.

01:00:47.254 --> 01:00:49.253
If the North falls, we fall.
Three days.

01:00:49.254 --> 01:00:50.795
The remaining forces
in the Westerlands

01:00:50.796 --> 01:00:52.503
will take
the river road east.

01:00:52.504 --> 01:00:54.045
We'll meet at
Lord Harroway's Town

01:00:54.046 --> 01:00:56.045
and march together
to Winterfell.

01:00:56.046 --> 01:00:57.213
Ser Jaime.

01:00:58.338 --> 01:00:59.711
Your Grace.

01:00:59.712 --> 01:01:02.171
My lords, I need a
moment with my brother.

01:01:03.796 --> 01:01:05.629
Your Grace.

01:01:08.837 --> 01:01:12.669
- What are you doing?
- Preparing the expedition north.

01:01:12.670 --> 01:01:15.253
Expedition north?

01:01:15.254 --> 01:01:18.544
I always knew you were
the stupidest Lannister.

01:01:18.545 --> 01:01:21.212
The Starks and Targaryens
have united against us,

01:01:21.213 --> 01:01:23.337
and you want to fight
alongside them?

01:01:23.338 --> 01:01:25.295
Are you a traitor
or an idiot?

01:01:25.296 --> 01:01:27.253
You pledged our forces
to fight our common enemy...

01:01:27.254 --> 01:01:28.711
I'll say whatever
I need to say

01:01:28.712 --> 01:01:30.419
to ensure the survival
of our house.

01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:33.170
You expect me to trust the
man who murdered our father?

01:01:33.171 --> 01:01:36.753
You expect me to command our troops
to fight beside foreign scum,

01:01:36.754 --> 01:01:38.253
to fight for
the Dragon Queen?

01:01:38.254 --> 01:01:40.170
You saw it
with your own eyes.

01:01:40.171 --> 01:01:42.544
You saw a dead man
trying to kill us.

01:01:42.545 --> 01:01:44.378
I saw it burn.

01:01:44.379 --> 01:01:46.212
If dragons
can't stop them,

01:01:46.213 --> 01:01:49.253
if Dothraki and Unsullied
and Northmen can't stop them,

01:01:49.254 --> 01:01:51.253
how will our armies
make a difference?

01:01:51.254 --> 01:01:53.253
This isn't about
noble houses,

01:01:53.254 --> 01:01:55.378
this is about
the living and the dead!

01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:57.419
And I intend to stay
amongst the living.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:00.628
Let the Stark boy and his
new queen defend the North.

01:02:00.629 --> 01:02:02.836
We stay here
where we've always been.

01:02:02.837 --> 01:02:05.379
I made a promise.

01:02:07.545 --> 01:02:10.961
Our child
will rule Westeros.

01:02:10.962 --> 01:02:15.836
Our child will never be born
if the dead come south.

01:02:15.837 --> 01:02:17.419
The monsters are real.

01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:19.544
The white walkers,

01:02:19.545 --> 01:02:21.795
the dragons,
the Dothraki screamers...

01:02:21.796 --> 01:02:25.795
all the frightening stories we heard
when we were young, they're all real.

01:02:25.796 --> 01:02:27.503
So be it.

01:02:27.504 --> 01:02:29.628
Let the monsters
kill each other.

01:02:29.629 --> 01:02:31.878
And while they battle
in the North,

01:02:31.879 --> 01:02:34.295
we take back the lands
that belong to us.

01:02:34.296 --> 01:02:37.087
- And then what?
- And then we rule.

01:02:37.088 --> 01:02:40.003
When the fighting in the
North is over, someone wins.

01:02:40.004 --> 01:02:42.170
You understand that,
don't you?

01:02:42.171 --> 01:02:45.669
If the dead win, they march
south and kill us all.

01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:48.753
If the living win,
and we've betrayed them,

01:02:48.754 --> 01:02:50.711
they march south
and kill us all!

01:02:50.712 --> 01:02:53.711
The Targaryens and the Starks
already want to kill us all.

01:02:53.712 --> 01:02:55.128
Most of them
will die in the North.

01:02:55.129 --> 01:02:56.711
I faced them
in the field.

01:02:56.712 --> 01:02:59.253
We can't beat them.
We can't beat their dragons.

01:02:59.254 --> 01:03:00.795
How many dragons
did you see at the pit?

01:03:00.796 --> 01:03:02.795
- Two.
- What happened to the third?

01:03:02.796 --> 01:03:05.295
For all we know,
it's guarding her fleet!

01:03:05.296 --> 01:03:08.628
She came here with her dragons and
her Dothraki and her Unsullied.

01:03:08.629 --> 01:03:11.419
She came here to show us
all her power.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:14.461
No, something happened.
The dragons are vulnerable.

01:03:14.462 --> 01:03:17.003
We can't beat the Dothraki.
We don't have the numbers.

01:03:17.004 --> 01:03:18.836
We don't have the support
of the other houses!

01:03:18.837 --> 01:03:21.504
No, we have something better.
We have the Iron Bank.

01:03:23.504 --> 01:03:27.461
You should've listened more when Father
spoke about the importance of gold.

01:03:27.462 --> 01:03:29.628
Oh, I know
it's boring for you.

01:03:29.629 --> 01:03:33.253
You just wanted to hunt
and ride and fight.

01:03:33.254 --> 01:03:35.836
But I listened,
I learned.

01:03:35.837 --> 01:03:39.836
Highgarden bought us the most
powerful army in Essos...

01:03:39.837 --> 01:03:41.628
the Golden Company.

01:03:41.629 --> 01:03:45.337
20,000 men, horses,
elephants, I believe.

01:03:45.338 --> 01:03:47.003
The Golden Company
is not here.

01:03:47.004 --> 01:03:48.378
They're in Essos.

01:03:48.379 --> 01:03:52.337
How is a mercenary company
in Essos going to help us?

01:03:52.338 --> 01:03:54.836
Do you really think
Euron Greyjoy turned tail

01:03:54.837 --> 01:03:56.462
and sailed back
to the Iron Islands?

01:03:57.587 --> 01:03:58.961
Do you think
he abandoned

01:03:58.962 --> 01:04:02.212
the chance to marry
the queen?

01:04:02.213 --> 01:04:04.545
No one walks away
from me.

01:04:06.379 --> 01:04:08.045
He's sailing with
his fleet to Essos.

01:04:08.046 --> 01:04:10.128
He's going to ferry
the Golden Company back here

01:04:10.129 --> 01:04:11.670
to help us win
the war for Westeros.

01:04:14.213 --> 01:04:17.378
You plotted with Euron
Greyjoy without telling me,

01:04:17.379 --> 01:04:19.212
the commander
of your armies?

01:04:19.213 --> 01:04:21.836
And you conspired
with Tyrion,

01:04:21.837 --> 01:04:23.212
the man who murdered
our father,

01:04:23.213 --> 01:04:24.544
without telling me,
your queen.

01:04:24.545 --> 01:04:26.003
I didn't conspire
with him.

01:04:26.004 --> 01:04:27.878
You met with him in secret
without my consent.

01:04:27.879 --> 01:04:29.878
You planned to promote
my enemies' interests.

01:04:29.879 --> 01:04:32.170
That is the definition
of conspiracy.

01:04:32.171 --> 01:04:34.544
I pledged
to ride north.

01:04:34.545 --> 01:04:36.378
I intend to honor
that pledge.

01:04:36.379 --> 01:04:38.586
- And that will be treason.
- Treason?

01:04:38.587 --> 01:04:40.836
Disobeying your queen's command,
fighting with her enemies.

01:04:40.837 --> 01:04:42.171
What would you
call it?

01:04:44.171 --> 01:04:46.046
Doesn't matter
what I'd call it.

01:04:53.004 --> 01:04:55.754
I told you no one
walks away from me.

01:04:58.088 --> 01:05:00.629
Are you going to
order him to kill me?

01:05:02.754 --> 01:05:04.711
I'm the only one
you have left.

01:05:04.712 --> 01:05:07.170
Our children are gone,
our father is gone.

01:05:07.171 --> 01:05:08.920
It's just
me and you now.

01:05:08.921 --> 01:05:10.921
There's one more
yet to come.

01:05:13.921 --> 01:05:15.921
Give the order, then.

01:05:35.296 --> 01:05:37.004
I don't
believe you.

01:07:24.921 --> 01:07:27.420
Come in.

01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:32.878
Samwell Tarly.

01:07:32.879 --> 01:07:35.087
I wasn't sure
if you'd remember me.

01:07:35.088 --> 01:07:36.921
I remember everything.

01:07:45.088 --> 01:07:47.253
You helped us
get beyond the Wall.

01:07:47.254 --> 01:07:49.795
- You're a good man.
- Oh, well, thank you,

01:07:49.796 --> 01:07:52.420
but, um, I'm not sure
that I am.

01:07:56.587 --> 01:07:58.754
What happened to you
beyond the Wall?

01:08:00.171 --> 01:08:01.754
I became
the Three-Eyed Raven.

01:08:03.379 --> 01:08:04.462
Oh!

01:08:07.754 --> 01:08:10.128
I don't know
what that means.

01:08:10.129 --> 01:08:12.878
I can see things
that happened in the past.

01:08:12.879 --> 01:08:16.961
I can see things
happening now

01:08:16.962 --> 01:08:18.462
all over the world.

01:08:19.879 --> 01:08:22.296
Why did you come
to Winterfell?

01:08:23.587 --> 01:08:24.962
Um...

01:08:27.171 --> 01:08:29.337
Jon's the one to lead
the fight against the dead.

01:08:29.337 --> 01:08:31.419
I know he is.

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.377
But he can't
do it alone,

01:08:33.379 --> 01:08:36.252
so I've come here
to help him.

01:08:36.254 --> 01:08:39.127
He's on his way
back to Winterfell

01:08:39.129 --> 01:08:40.754
with Daenerys Targaryen.

01:08:41.921 --> 01:08:44.961
You...
you saw this in...

01:08:44.962 --> 01:08:46.629
in a vision?

01:08:49.629 --> 01:08:50.837
Oh.

01:08:53.629 --> 01:08:55.837
He needs to know
the truth.

01:08:57.087 --> 01:08:58.377
The truth
about what?

01:08:58.379 --> 01:09:00.170
About himself.

01:09:00.171 --> 01:09:03.711
No one knows.
No one but me.

01:09:03.712 --> 01:09:06.669
Jon isn't really
my father's son.

01:09:06.670 --> 01:09:10.836
He's the son of Rhaegar Targaryen
and my aunt, Lyanna Stark.

01:09:10.837 --> 01:09:14.669
He was born
in a tower in Dorne.

01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:17.127
His last name
isn't really Snow,

01:09:17.129 --> 01:09:18.129
it's Sand.

01:09:20.504 --> 01:09:21.504
It's not.

01:09:23.087 --> 01:09:25.502
Dornish bastards
are named Sand.

01:09:25.504 --> 01:09:29.127
At the Citadel, I transcribed
a High Septon's diary.

01:09:29.129 --> 01:09:31.879
He annulled Rhaegar's
marriage to Elia.

01:09:33.670 --> 01:09:36.587
He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna
in a secret ceremony.

01:09:37.879 --> 01:09:39.337
Are you certain?

01:09:39.337 --> 01:09:42.045
It's what the High Septon
wrote in his private diary.

01:09:42.046 --> 01:09:43.879
I don't know
why he'd lie.

01:09:45.712 --> 01:09:48.254
Is this something
you can see?

01:09:49.712 --> 01:09:53.544
Father, Smith, Warrior,

01:09:53.545 --> 01:09:58.419
Mother, Maiden,
Crone, Stranger.

01:09:58.420 --> 01:10:02.212
- I am hers and she is mine...
- I am his and he is mine...

01:10:02.213 --> 01:10:06.544
from this day
until the end of my days.

01:10:06.545 --> 01:10:09.670
Robert's
Rebellion was built on a lie.

01:10:11.796 --> 01:10:14.921
Rhaegar didn't
kidnap my aunt or rape her.

01:10:24.504 --> 01:10:26.046
He loved her.

01:10:33.796 --> 01:10:35.420
And she loved him.

01:11:01.837 --> 01:11:04.796
And Jon...

01:11:06.837 --> 01:11:08.629
Jon's real name...

01:11:10.629 --> 01:11:14.961
His name
is Aegon Targaryen.

01:11:14.962 --> 01:11:17.171
You have
to protect him.

01:11:18.670 --> 01:11:20.587
Promise me, Ned.

01:11:43.379 --> 01:11:45.670
He's never been a bastard.

01:11:49.587 --> 01:11:52.296
He's the
heir to the Iron Throne.

01:12:07.129 --> 01:12:08.837
He needs to know.

01:12:12.046 --> 01:12:13.837
We need to tell him.

01:12:24.171 --> 01:12:26.878
Are you
all right?

01:12:26.879 --> 01:12:28.795
It's just strange.

01:12:28.796 --> 01:12:32.754
In his own horrible way,
I believe he loved me.

01:12:36.712 --> 01:12:38.253
You did
the right thing.

01:12:38.254 --> 01:12:40.795
You did it.

01:12:40.796 --> 01:12:42.628
I'm just
the executioner.

01:12:42.629 --> 01:12:44.379
You passed
the sentence.

01:12:46.545 --> 01:12:49.378
You're the Lady
of Winterfell.

01:12:49.379 --> 01:12:50.754
Does that bother you?

01:12:53.338 --> 01:12:56.213
I was never going to be
as good a lady as you.

01:12:57.670 --> 01:12:59.171
So I had to be
something else.

01:13:01.379 --> 01:13:04.128
I never could have survived
what you survived.

01:13:04.129 --> 01:13:06.461
You would have.

01:13:06.462 --> 01:13:08.462
You're the strongest
person I know.

01:13:12.545 --> 01:13:15.088
I believe that's the nicest
thing you've ever said to me.

01:13:16.670 --> 01:13:20.461
Well, don't get
used to it.

01:13:20.462 --> 01:13:22.712
You're still very
strange and annoying.

01:13:29.213 --> 01:13:31.213
"In winter, we must
protect ourselves.

01:13:32.754 --> 01:13:34.796
Look after
one another."

01:13:36.921 --> 01:13:38.629
Father.

01:13:41.754 --> 01:13:45.920
"When the snows fall
and the white winds blow,

01:13:45.921 --> 01:13:47.878
the lone wolf dies,

01:13:47.879 --> 01:13:50.338
but the pack survives."

01:13:57.338 --> 01:13:58.629
I miss him.

01:14:01.962 --> 01:14:03.462
Me, too.

01:15:25.088 --> 01:15:27.212
It's a long way down.

01:15:27.213 --> 01:15:31.046
Yeah. The crows keep telling
me I'll get used to it.

01:15:39.796 --> 01:15:42.836
I can see movement...

01:15:42.837 --> 01:15:45.545
Watch, on the tree line!

01:15:46.670 --> 01:15:48.378
What is it?

01:17:19.545 --> 01:17:20.670
Come on!

01:17:21.879 --> 01:17:24.504
Run! Run!
