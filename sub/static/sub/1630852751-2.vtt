00:15.140 --> 00:18.268
<i>For Terry, every day,</i>
<i>means a new murder case,</i>

00:18.351 --> 00:21.771
<i>and a new celebrity guest star</i>
<i>as his partner.</i>

00:22.272 --> 00:26.484
<i>Today's guest:</i>
<i>football star Marshawn Lynch.</i>

00:26.985 --> 00:28.653
<i>But here's the catch.</i>

00:28.737 --> 00:30.822
<i>Marshawn isn't being given a script.</i>

00:30.905 --> 00:33.825
<i>He has no idea what's about to happen.</i>

00:34.325 --> 00:38.872
<i>Together, he and Terry will have</i>
<i>to improvise their way through the case.</i>

00:38.955 --> 00:42.083
<i>But it'll be up to Marshawn alone</i>
<i>to name the killer.</i>

00:42.834 --> 00:46.087
<i>So join them</i>
<i>as they punch a one-way ticket</i>

00:46.921 --> 00:48.631
<i>to Murderville.</i>

00:58.933 --> 01:02.312
<i>Death. It's a part of the job</i>
<i>when you're a homicide detective.</i>

01:02.812 --> 01:04.355
<i>You learn to live with it.</i>

01:04.439 --> 01:06.483
<i>But when someone close to you dies,</i>

01:06.566 --> 01:10.653
<i>you remember that death isn't just</i>
<i>a part of the job, it's a part of life.</i>

01:11.571 --> 01:12.405
<i>The last part.</i>

01:12.489 --> 01:13.782
Terry, is that an urn?

01:18.578 --> 01:20.038
Yes, I've…

01:21.623 --> 01:22.749
suffered a loss.

01:24.125 --> 01:25.126
I'm sorry to hear that, man.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.962
Well, death comes for us all.

01:28.046 --> 01:29.839
It finally came for my great-Aunt Vivian.

01:30.715 --> 01:31.591
What's going on?

01:31.674 --> 01:33.134
No, I was just--

01:33.760 --> 01:34.844
Vivian Larson?

01:35.345 --> 01:36.805
Didn't she die a long time ago?

01:36.888 --> 01:38.515
2009 isn't that long ago.

01:39.390 --> 01:40.558
Wait, what?

01:40.642 --> 01:43.394
We were going up the coast
to scatter her ashes

01:43.478 --> 01:46.356
when you totaled
your Camaro trying to Tokyo Drift.

01:46.439 --> 01:48.316
I wasn't trying to Tokyo Drift.

01:48.399 --> 01:50.443
- I was Tokyo Drifting.
- Okay.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.945
My mistake was being too good at it.

01:52.028 --> 01:53.488
Oh. Terry,

01:53.571 --> 01:56.658
has she been sitting in the back
of your trunk for the last 12 years?

01:56.741 --> 01:57.659
Of course not!

01:58.493 --> 01:59.744
She's wedged under the front seat.

01:59.828 --> 02:02.831
Found her this morning when I was cleaning
out the Camaro for the scrap metal guy.

02:02.914 --> 02:05.792
Well, I'm glad you're finally
taking care of it, I guess.

02:05.875 --> 02:06.918
Well, it was time.

02:07.001 --> 02:09.087
Thought I could maybe work
on the body, give it a new paint job,

02:09.170 --> 02:10.922
but then rats
got into the electrical wiring.

02:11.005 --> 02:13.258
And once that happens, I mean forget it.
It's just like an endless thing.

02:13.341 --> 02:14.926
- It wasn't worth it.
- No, I was talking about…

02:15.009 --> 02:15.969
never mind.

02:16.052 --> 02:20.098
Anyway, I've got something to take
your mind off of Aunt Viv.

02:20.598 --> 02:21.599
A new partner.

02:21.683 --> 02:24.853
What? Come on, Chief. No way.
Today, I'm in mourning.

02:24.936 --> 02:26.020
Come on out, Marshawn.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.441
Oh, yeah.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.737
Terry, say hi to your new partner,
Marshawn Lynch.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.531
Marshawn, this is senior detective,
Terry Seattle.

02:37.323 --> 02:39.284
And his great-Aunt Vivian.

02:40.118 --> 02:41.661
Oh…

02:42.203 --> 02:43.288
Sorry about Aunt Viv.

02:43.371 --> 02:44.914
Not as sorry as she is.

02:44.998 --> 02:48.626
Okay, show him the ropes.
And will you please take care of this?

02:48.710 --> 02:50.086
Preferably before the Camaro.

02:50.170 --> 02:50.879
- Got it.
- Yeah.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.005
You've got a Camaro?

02:52.088 --> 02:54.591
Well… had, have.

02:55.174 --> 02:57.260
Not in the-- Here. Hold on to Aunt Vivian.

02:57.760 --> 02:59.345
Follow me. I'll tell you everything.

03:00.388 --> 03:02.432
You trust me with Aunt Viv like that?

03:02.515 --> 03:04.142
Grab a seat, Marshawn.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.311
Thanks. Gotcha.

03:09.564 --> 03:13.026
So you want to be a homicide detective.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.944
Yeah. Hell yeah.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.571
You think you'd be good at it?

03:16.654 --> 03:20.116
Mmm, shit, I don't know. Wait, what
you want me to do with your auntie here?

03:20.199 --> 03:23.328
Well, that right there.
That's what we all become eventually.

03:24.662 --> 03:25.246
A vase?

03:26.080 --> 03:28.625
- No, we become a pile of dust.
- Oh, oh.

03:28.708 --> 03:30.752
Yeah, unless you die in the woods
and are never found,

03:30.835 --> 03:34.881
then you become kind of like a--
like a wet pile until the animals eat you.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.591
Oh, by the way, while we at it,

03:37.091 --> 03:39.218
I was thinking can--
I wanted to change my name.

03:40.178 --> 03:42.388
Well, sure. I mean that's a different
department down at City Hall,

03:42.472 --> 03:43.514
but I can look into it.

03:43.598 --> 03:44.641
What would you like to change it to?

03:44.724 --> 03:47.101
I want to be Detective Bagabitch.

03:47.185 --> 03:49.020
Is that Belarusian?

03:49.103 --> 03:50.688
That's Oak Native.

03:51.189 --> 03:52.440
Bagabitch.

03:52.523 --> 03:53.983
- Like that.
- Okay.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.902
- What you think?
- Well, I think, I mean--

03:55.985 --> 03:58.029
- Detective Bagabitch.
- Detective Bagabitch, so when I bag

03:58.112 --> 04:00.114
the murderer, it's like,
"I bagged you, bitch."

04:00.198 --> 04:02.158
Okay. Let me see--
Let me just call my friend,

04:02.242 --> 04:04.619
Carol, who works down in City Hall.

04:04.702 --> 04:08.373
Carol, it's senior detective Terry Seattle
here, calling from homicide.

04:08.456 --> 04:13.378
Uh, listen, I've got a special request
from a hot young homicide trainee

04:13.461 --> 04:19.050
would like to change his name
and desired name is detective "Bagabitch."

04:19.759 --> 04:22.178
No. It's too much emphasis on the "itch."

04:22.262 --> 04:23.596
You gotta-- 'cause, 'cause it's French,

04:23.680 --> 04:26.099
so it's "Bagabiche".

04:26.182 --> 04:29.602
Sorry, it's "Detective Bagabiche."

04:30.353 --> 04:31.145
Bye-bye.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.232
- Great. So, it's in the works.
- Thank you, Boss. I appreciate it.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.776
How does it feel to hold
a human life in your hands?

04:36.859 --> 04:37.694
This is a human?

04:37.777 --> 04:39.946
Being a homicide cop, that's what this is.

04:40.029 --> 04:43.408
Holding the dead close and whispering,
"I will avenge you."

04:43.491 --> 04:44.867
You wanna try that? Try that.

04:45.368 --> 04:47.287
Alright. Let's see what I got.

04:47.787 --> 04:52.125
I will avenge you for the motherfucker
who knocked you down.

04:52.625 --> 04:54.085
I'm gon' get that motherfucker.

04:54.168 --> 04:56.004
And when I get that motherfucker,

04:56.087 --> 04:59.257
Ima split that motherfucker
'cause I got your back.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.467
Yeah, could I tell you that is so moving

05:01.551 --> 05:03.803
to hear you talk about getting
that motherfucker.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.138
Yeah, because that's what I do.

05:05.221 --> 05:06.639
You're gonna split that motherfucker.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.183
I'ma split that motherfucker like a wood.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.019
Like a piece of fucking wood.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.854
No, no, no. Like a bat wood.

05:12.937 --> 05:13.771
Could I try?

05:14.272 --> 05:15.648
Yeah. Sure. Hell yeah.

05:18.776 --> 05:19.777
You ready?

05:21.279 --> 05:23.573
I make you this promise, Aunt Viv,

05:23.656 --> 05:25.867
as long as the sun rises,

05:26.492 --> 05:28.536
as long as I walk this Earth,

05:29.037 --> 05:31.080
as long as I draw breath…

05:33.124 --> 05:35.585
I will avenge you.

05:38.921 --> 05:40.173
Jesus, Terry.

05:40.256 --> 05:42.842
What? We're not allowed
to avenge the dead, now?

05:42.925 --> 05:45.595
She died in her sleep
at a hundred and two.

05:45.678 --> 05:48.681
Yeah, but we don't know why.
There was never an autopsy.

05:48.765 --> 05:51.601
You want a dead old lady?
Well, I've got one for you.

05:51.684 --> 05:52.685
There's been a murder.

05:53.644 --> 05:57.190
84 years old bludgeoned to death
in her mansion.

05:57.273 --> 05:59.442
Now, she's some sort of big shot so

06:00.193 --> 06:00.985
please

06:01.486 --> 06:03.738
do not screw this up and…

06:04.864 --> 06:05.782
Good luck.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.951
Good-- What you mean good luck?
Why you making that face, like--

06:09.035 --> 06:12.330
We're very superstitious here
at the police station.

06:12.413 --> 06:14.582
But why she make
that face on the way out, though?

06:14.665 --> 06:17.085
She always makes that face.
That's just kind of her face.

06:17.168 --> 06:18.920
That's one of the reasons
we're getting divorced.

06:19.003 --> 06:21.005
Man, boy, y'all got some shit
going on here.

06:21.089 --> 06:24.133
Yeah. I got a lot of stuff. It is a very
complicated life I'm living right now.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.511
Hold on.
Hey, so do I get to catch me a body too?

06:26.594 --> 06:29.138
Listen, we got this murder case
that she just gave us, okay?

06:29.222 --> 06:30.556
- Alright.
- And I'm going to need your help.

06:30.640 --> 06:33.392
By the way, how much homicide
investigative training have you had?

06:33.476 --> 06:34.977
I watched <i>Training Day</i>.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.104
That's perfect.

06:36.187 --> 06:40.483
- King Kong ain't got shit on me!
- King Kong ain't got nothin' on me!

06:40.566 --> 06:41.526
You know what I'm talking about.

06:41.609 --> 06:42.860
But we gonna catch
this motherfucker, though.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.279
We gonna catch this motherfucker for sure.

06:47.657 --> 06:51.077
<i>Marshawn and I headed</i>
<i>to the city morgue to examine the body.</i>

06:51.160 --> 06:53.454
<i>This is always the toughest part</i>
<i>of the job.</i>

06:53.538 --> 06:57.917
<i>Parking is terrible there and they make</i>
<i>you sign out a key to use the bathroom.</i>

06:58.584 --> 07:01.671
Amber, this is Marshawn Lynch,
my new partner.

07:01.754 --> 07:04.006
Marshawn, this is Amber Kang, forensics.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.884
You're both kind of cool so I'm sure
you're going to hit it off just fine.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.053
By the way, this is Marshawn's first case

07:09.137 --> 07:11.472
and he knows absolutely nothing
about murder investigations.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.516
So let him run point on it.

07:13.599 --> 07:16.269
So this is your first murder case?

07:16.894 --> 07:18.646
- Facts.
- Okay.

07:18.729 --> 07:19.981
- Okay, what?
- Are you ready for this?

07:22.859 --> 07:23.985
What's in there?

07:35.079 --> 07:37.415
She really likes
to keep a positive workplace.

07:37.498 --> 07:39.876
- I do, I do, I do.
- The voice of an Angel.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.794
- All right, let's get down to business.
- Okay.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.509
Cora Worthington,
legendary doll designer.

07:48.593 --> 07:52.013
Cause of death is blunt force trauma
to the right temple.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.598
Based on how she fell,

07:53.681 --> 07:57.018
she was facing her killer so her killer
was left-handed.

07:57.101 --> 07:58.144
- Left-handed.
- Ooh, left-handed.

07:58.227 --> 08:01.564
And, judging by the tophat shaped dent
in her skull,

08:02.607 --> 08:04.692
this was the murder weapon.

08:05.443 --> 08:08.279
Tommy Tuxedo! Oh, my God,
you guys remember Tommy Tuxedo, right?

08:08.362 --> 08:10.531
No, that's Chucky.
They just put a suit on him.

08:10.615 --> 08:14.535
No! Tommy Tuxedo was the doll to have
when I was growing up.

08:14.619 --> 08:18.539
He was like a worldwide sensation!
Wait, she created Tommy?

08:18.623 --> 08:21.667
Oh, yeah. She modeled him
after her own sons.

08:21.751 --> 08:25.546
Over 50 million sold worldwide.
This family is worth a fortune.

08:25.630 --> 08:27.298
What kind of sick ass shit is that?

08:27.381 --> 08:28.549
Wow!

08:29.634 --> 08:30.843
Wow!

08:30.927 --> 08:33.804
God, it's just-- I always wanted
to have a Tommy Tuxedo growing up,

08:33.888 --> 08:36.974
but Mom couldn't afford it.
So she got me a knockoff:

08:37.058 --> 08:38.976
Oscar Overalls. He was…

08:39.060 --> 08:41.103
- Oscar?
- Yeah, Oscar Overalls.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.231
That's like a huge downgrade, bro.

08:43.314 --> 08:45.775
He was… He was… He was fine.

08:45.858 --> 08:49.445
So the killer spray-painted
a message to Cora on the wall.

08:51.113 --> 08:54.575
"How much do you love him, Mom?"

08:54.659 --> 08:56.577
Shitty speller.
So it's gotta be the son.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.538
It's got to be the son that you--
Yeah, one of those sons.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.497
And get this.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.919
Security camera footage
showed a clear image of

09:05.002 --> 09:06.879
this man leaving the scene.

09:07.380 --> 09:08.923
Wha-- Wait…

09:09.006 --> 09:10.633
But that's the killer right there.

09:10.716 --> 09:13.553
What are we even doing here? We gotta--
we just gotta go arrest him.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.846
Come on. I told you this is easy.
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.557
It's not quite that simple, Terry.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.183
Oh, shit.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.851
See Cora's sons were…

09:21.936 --> 09:23.771
identical triplets.

09:23.854 --> 09:26.816
Triplets, huh? Guess what, Marshawn?

09:27.316 --> 09:30.903
This case just got twice as interesting.

09:32.655 --> 09:35.241
<i>Three sons, three suspects.</i>

09:35.324 --> 09:38.160
<i>By my account,</i>
<i>that was six people we'd have to question.</i>

09:38.244 --> 09:39.996
<i>First up was Charles Worthington,</i>

09:40.079 --> 09:43.457
<i>who'd been running the Tommy Tuxedo</i>
<i>business since Cora retired.</i>

09:43.541 --> 09:44.292
Oh, come on, man!

09:44.375 --> 09:49.714
<i>Charles stood to gain big time now</i>
<i>that she was retired… from being alive.</i>

09:49.797 --> 09:51.132
- Interesting little set-up.
- Okay.

09:51.215 --> 09:55.011
Yeah. The interrogation, Charles
has agreed to come here and be interviewed

09:55.094 --> 09:56.637
which gives us the advantage.

09:56.721 --> 09:57.888
Which triplet is this?

09:57.972 --> 09:59.640
- Charles.
- Charles.

09:59.724 --> 10:02.560
He's the one who looks like…
the other two.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.020
- But here's the deal…
- Got you.

10:04.103 --> 10:07.273
What he doesn't know is that the
interrogation room has a two-way mirror,

10:07.356 --> 10:10.526
so we can observe him and he can't see us.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.862
- Yo, Terry.
- What, Daz?

10:12.945 --> 10:15.656
Just wanted to make sure you saw
the email about the two-way mirror.

10:15.740 --> 10:19.035
What, no, my account was suspended
for multiple phishing scams.

10:19.118 --> 10:22.580
Well, it's not there. Perp shattered it.
Replacement's coming tomorrow.

10:22.663 --> 10:23.706
What?

10:28.044 --> 10:30.171
- Thanks, Daz.
- You're welcome?

10:30.254 --> 10:32.173
I hope your replacement's coming tomorrow!

10:32.923 --> 10:35.217
Is this supposed to be like--

10:35.301 --> 10:36.636
No, it's not supposed to be like this

10:36.719 --> 10:38.971
and we can't let Charles see us
through this hole in the wall.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.723
Here's what we got to do. Are you ready?

10:40.806 --> 10:42.058
When Charles comes in,

10:42.558 --> 10:44.644
you're going to have to mirror his moves
exactly

10:44.727 --> 10:45.936
so he still thinks
that there's a mirror there.

10:46.020 --> 10:50.107
We don't have time to discuss
the implausibility of this scenario!

10:50.191 --> 10:52.068
Whatever he does, you do.

10:52.151 --> 10:53.736
Just wait in here, sir.

10:53.819 --> 10:56.697
Mirror him! Mirror him!
Go this way, right here.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.867


11:01.243 --> 11:02.411
Okay.

11:03.954 --> 11:07.458
Just be cool, dog. Just be cool. You know?

11:07.958 --> 11:12.129
You're a cool dude and this is
just a meeting. That's all this is.

11:12.213 --> 11:16.217
Just a meeting and you're a big shot.

11:29.397 --> 11:31.107
Get psyched about life!

11:31.774 --> 11:34.276
- Detectives will be with you shortly.
- Yeah, cool, cool, cool.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.194
'Cause I don't have all day.

11:35.277 --> 11:37.071
You know, I'm kind of doing them
a big favor by being here.

11:37.154 --> 11:39.073
Wait, is there somebody else here?

11:42.284 --> 11:43.494
Oh, God.

11:45.121 --> 11:46.414
I look terrible.

11:47.581 --> 11:52.253
I look like a guy who was given
three days to live and this is day 5.

11:52.336 --> 11:55.756
Yeah, you look like a guy
that kicked out of a sex cult

11:55.840 --> 11:57.925
and then they let him back in,
and they kicked him out again.

11:58.008 --> 12:00.803
Yeah! I got kicked out and put it back in,
and kicked out.

12:00.886 --> 12:03.639
Yeah, they kicked you out of the sex cult
and they put you back in.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.977
I look like a sack of shit
that's been left in the sun too long.

12:08.769 --> 12:11.856
You're very successful
and women want to date you!

12:11.939 --> 12:13.691
What the hell, man?

12:13.774 --> 12:15.860
What kind of mind games
are you guys trying to play on me?

12:15.943 --> 12:18.529
The kind of mind games that get results!

12:18.612 --> 12:20.114
Come on, Marshawn. Let's go!

12:21.574 --> 12:24.160
Jeeze.

12:24.243 --> 12:28.122
Boss, get your goofy ass up, man.
You alright?

12:28.205 --> 12:29.582
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Alright.

12:29.665 --> 12:30.666
You, out!

12:32.418 --> 12:33.711
Well, okay.

12:35.713 --> 12:36.630
Charles, have a seat.

12:36.714 --> 12:38.007
Yeah, fine.

12:38.924 --> 12:39.925
I will have a seat.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.928
So, what's up? You guys wanted to talk?

12:43.596 --> 12:46.932
First of all,
my condolences on your mother.

12:47.016 --> 12:48.517
Thank you. Thank you for saying that.

12:49.351 --> 12:52.354
Listen, my partner has a few questions
for you in his notebook.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.481
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.816
Do you know who would want
to harm your mother?

12:57.193 --> 13:00.321
Literally everybody, okay?

13:00.404 --> 13:04.825
Cora was a mean old woman.
Write that down.

13:04.909 --> 13:07.036
Everybody hated her.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.497
- Hey, I got a question for you guys.
- Remember she said that she made

13:09.580 --> 13:12.208
- Yes, go ahead.
- the dolls in the resemblance of her kids.

13:12.291 --> 13:13.918
- Yeah. She did say that.
- We gotta remember that.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.586
They are triplets,

13:15.669 --> 13:17.129
- so they look the same.
- I can hear you.

13:17.213 --> 13:18.172
You still can hear us?

13:18.255 --> 13:19.381
Very clearly.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.716
- Well, act like you can't.
- Okay?

13:20.799 --> 13:22.343
- The fuck?
- Fine.

13:22.426 --> 13:24.011
When was the last time
you seen your mother?

13:24.094 --> 13:25.387
Two days ago.

13:25.471 --> 13:30.017
She rejected my ideas
for the redesign of Tommy Tuxedo.

13:30.100 --> 13:31.727
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait a second.

13:31.810 --> 13:35.189
You can't redesign Tommy Tuxedo.
He is a timeless classic!

13:35.272 --> 13:37.149
So you guys are into Tommy Tuxedo?

13:37.233 --> 13:38.400
More him.

13:38.484 --> 13:42.238
This guy? Well, I got a news flash
for you, Boomer. Okay?

13:42.321 --> 13:43.781
Whoa!

13:45.616 --> 13:49.537
You guys want to see
the new redesign? Check this out.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.081
Blough! Blough, blough, blough, blough!

13:52.665 --> 13:56.835
What do you think? Look at
the stars on the butt. Look at that hair!

13:56.919 --> 13:58.546
That hair is so bitchin'.

13:58.629 --> 13:59.964
It's pretty much finished.

14:00.047 --> 14:04.218
But I mean, I am the CEO and now
I'm in charge creatively.

14:04.301 --> 14:07.930
So, if y'all guys got any ideas,
I'd be interested in taking 'em.

14:08.013 --> 14:08.847
- What do you think?
- Okay.

14:08.931 --> 14:09.932
Any ideas for this cool doll idea?

14:10.015 --> 14:11.392
I think he just opened the door for us.

14:11.475 --> 14:12.643
Okay, uh…

14:12.726 --> 14:14.061
Anything! There's no wrong answers.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.730
- Modern kids love to dance.
- They love to dance!

14:16.814 --> 14:18.774
They love
to listen to rock and roll music.

14:18.857 --> 14:20.025
- We could put a--
- He's gottta dab.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.318
- Oh, he's gotta dab.
- He's gotta--

14:21.402 --> 14:24.071
How do you spell dab?
I can't spell for shit.

14:24.154 --> 14:27.116
Tommy already looked like an
old-school player, though, you feel me?

14:27.199 --> 14:28.951
I've seen <i>Harlem Nights</i> back in the day.

14:29.034 --> 14:31.120
The way that he used to be dressed
was just like that.

14:31.203 --> 14:33.497
But now, he on some new age
space pimping and shit now.

14:33.581 --> 14:34.415
- Yeah.
- Okay!

14:34.498 --> 14:35.916
- You feel what I'm feeling?
- Space pimp Tommy,

14:36.000 --> 14:38.002
but the <i>Harlem Nights</i> throwback.

14:38.085 --> 14:40.379
- I like that.
- He's riding on a Razor.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.131
I like all these ideas.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.424
You might put some deuces
on that motherfucker.

14:43.507 --> 14:45.593
I don't even know what that is,
but I like the sound of it!

14:45.676 --> 14:47.094
- I like the sound of it!
- That's all right, don't trip.

14:47.177 --> 14:48.762
You know, just keep this shit flowing…

14:48.846 --> 14:51.891
Deuces and twenty-twos, okay?

14:51.974 --> 14:54.059
My mother fucking guy, dog.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.227
- Do you understand what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.770
Not really, but sure.

14:56.854 --> 14:57.813
- Oh, man.
- Oh, okay.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.523
Yeah, there's a lot of great ideas here.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.484
You know what? You get to be
our new spokesman, obviously.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.069
We get Tommy Tune.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.532
I don't think anybody knows who that is.
No one knows who that is.

15:08.616 --> 15:11.285
We need to get Tommy
a glizzy with a swizzy.

15:11.368 --> 15:14.121
Oh, a glizzy with a swizzy. I mean--

15:14.204 --> 15:15.956
Oh, my God, look at that.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.667
- You know what that is? It's butter, baby.
- I don't. I don't.

15:18.751 --> 15:19.793
Do you do a Tommy--

15:19.877 --> 15:23.631
"Tommy-three and Me" so you can find out
the origin of your Tommy.

15:23.714 --> 15:27.259
- And DNA, and then it--
- Oh, shit! That motherfucker!

15:31.347 --> 15:35.768
<i>Our next stop was 200 feet</i>
<i>underground to visit Chester Worthington,</i>

15:35.851 --> 15:37.603
<i>the youngest of Cora's triplets.</i>

15:37.686 --> 15:40.940
<i>He'd renounced his family</i>
<i>and become a Doomsday prepper.</i>

15:41.482 --> 15:42.816
<i>Well, guess what?</i>

15:42.900 --> 15:46.153
<i>Doomsday was here.</i>
<i>And it was me and Marshawn.</i>

15:46.654 --> 15:48.447
<i>Metaphorically.</i>

15:48.530 --> 15:50.199
That's some spooky ass shit.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.868
Yeah. These Doomsdayers,

15:52.952 --> 15:56.246
they're uh,
paranoid and they often booby trap.

15:56.789 --> 15:59.166
Maybe you ought to go first. Just to--

15:59.667 --> 16:02.211
- Yeah, you know, you got it. Yeah, I'm--
- What the fuck is all this shit, man?

16:02.294 --> 16:03.337
So, listen, I think that--

16:04.880 --> 16:06.966
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:07.049 --> 16:08.801
I'll take you now, motherfucker!

16:08.884 --> 16:10.094
We can't hear you!

16:10.177 --> 16:12.054
Hey! We can't hear you, we can't hear you!

16:12.554 --> 16:13.806
Turn that thing off!

16:15.432 --> 16:17.559
- Turn the sound off, we're cops.
- You want me to turn it off!

16:17.643 --> 16:19.645
Marshawn, let him turn off the alarm.

16:19.728 --> 16:20.688
Can you turn it--

16:22.022 --> 16:22.898
Turn it off.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.066
- The lights!
- Okay!

16:24.858 --> 16:28.278
What's going on? Is the world over?

16:28.362 --> 16:31.031
Did it end? Is the apocalypse upon us?

16:31.115 --> 16:32.282
Wait, what?

16:32.366 --> 16:34.451
Is the apocalypse upon us?

16:34.535 --> 16:35.536
No, it's Tuesday.

16:35.619 --> 16:37.663
Marshawn, give him his bat back.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.124
We're homicide detectives and we're just--

16:40.207 --> 16:41.333
Man, you didn't see this shit?

16:41.417 --> 16:43.961
Man, we're showing you the thing,
you know what I mean?

16:44.044 --> 16:47.631
I didn't know what the--
I haven't had visitors in a long time.

16:47.715 --> 16:49.091
So the world isn't over?

16:49.174 --> 16:50.926
No, no, you wait--
So you live down here full-time?

16:51.010 --> 16:54.513
Yeah. Yeah, I live down here full-time
in my bunker.

16:54.596 --> 16:56.807
- I never leave ever.
- Never leave.

16:56.890 --> 16:59.018
- Unless, you know, I need supplies.
- Okay, okay.

16:59.101 --> 17:01.228
Like a Wetzel's Pretzel,
something like that.

17:01.311 --> 17:03.814
Or if I get really bored,
then I would leave then, also.

17:03.897 --> 17:06.650
That's three
right off the top of your head examples.

17:06.734 --> 17:08.277
And what would you say?
What was your deal?

17:08.360 --> 17:10.237
Well, like I said,
we're City homicide detectives

17:10.320 --> 17:12.156
- and we just want to ask you a few--
- Oh, right.

17:12.239 --> 17:15.117
A few questions that we got for you
about your mom's murder.

17:15.826 --> 17:19.663
That caught me.
That caught me real, real deep.

17:19.747 --> 17:23.667
But anyway-- Hey guys, just so you know,
you don't have jurisdiction down here.

17:23.751 --> 17:24.585
- Okay?
- Oh, yeah?

17:24.668 --> 17:27.588
Because I seceded from the United States

17:27.671 --> 17:30.257
and I've started my own country:
Chester World.

17:30.340 --> 17:32.634
Wait a second. You just start--
You can't just start your own country.

17:32.718 --> 17:35.763
Yeah, you can and I can do
whatever I want down here.

17:35.846 --> 17:38.098
I think he's not right.
I think he's not right.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.434
I think this might be the one who got

17:40.517 --> 17:42.895
- the least shit that go up top here.
- Yep.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.314
I can hear exactly
what you're saying about me.

17:45.397 --> 17:48.150
I will say they can all hear.
They got great hearing.

17:48.233 --> 17:49.485
Put that down there.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.778
- Great hearing.
- Yeah.

17:50.861 --> 17:51.862
Here's the deal.

17:51.945 --> 17:53.655
I'll be happy to answer
any of your questions for you…

17:53.739 --> 17:54.531
Sure, sure.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.742
…if you help me with a little project.

17:56.825 --> 17:58.786
- Project. We better get on it.
- Come here.

17:58.869 --> 18:02.664
Check this out.
Got some company in the house.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.627
Alright, alright.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.129
I'm designing my own currency,

18:09.213 --> 18:12.591
so when society fails
and the dollar is worthless,

18:12.674 --> 18:14.802
I'll be the richest man
in the whole world.

18:14.885 --> 18:19.932
But the thing is I'm going to print
the million Chester Buck bill

18:20.015 --> 18:23.393
and I need
someone super cool to be on the bill.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.937
Oh, me! Put me on there.

18:25.020 --> 18:27.981
- I'm saying me! Me, me, me, please!
- Someone cool. Someone cool.

18:28.065 --> 18:30.984
Yeah, someone cool,
but you can take the pictures.

18:31.068 --> 18:31.985
Congratulations.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.488
- I think he feelin' the kid, man.
- Yeah. Have a seat.

18:34.571 --> 18:36.281
I was so close to being on the--

18:36.365 --> 18:38.200
Right about here. Have a seat.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.785
Let's take some photos.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.246
Yeah. What kind of questions
did you have for me?

18:42.329 --> 18:44.957
Nothing. They're very
innocent questions we had.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.708
What's the relationship

18:46.792 --> 18:48.293
- What's that?
- with you and your mother?

18:48.377 --> 18:51.547
There was no relationship
because to be honest,

18:51.630 --> 18:55.467
Mom and my brothers
took their eyes off the big picture

18:55.551 --> 18:58.512
that the world is ending.

18:58.595 --> 19:01.974
- And Tommy Tuxedo can't save them!
- Okay.

19:02.057 --> 19:03.559
You got any more questions for me?

19:03.642 --> 19:05.394
When was the last time you seen your mom?

19:05.477 --> 19:09.106
The last time I saw my mom
was recently in court

19:09.189 --> 19:13.569
when she was suing me to get evicted
from my bunker.

19:13.652 --> 19:15.279
She tried to kick you out
your own country.

19:15.362 --> 19:18.657
You can't sue someone
and claim that it's your property

19:18.740 --> 19:20.784
just because I built it on your property.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.119
Right.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.246
Hey, can you look right here
and give me a look, just for me?

19:24.329 --> 19:26.707
Some personal shots,
maybe like a Marilyn Monroe?

19:26.790 --> 19:30.460
Hey, dog, I ain't into taking pictures
and all that kinda shit like that

19:30.544 --> 19:32.212
but we got any more questions for him?

19:32.296 --> 19:34.715
Hey, you know what? I'm gonna go
print these up from the printer. Okay?

19:34.798 --> 19:35.674
Okay. Right now?

19:35.757 --> 19:38.844
I'll be right back. I'm just gonna go
print these and then I'll be right back.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.012
Okay.

19:40.637 --> 19:44.099
All right. Listen. Listen, I think
he really likes you and he trusts you.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.352
So here's what we got to try to do,
when he comes back,

19:48.020 --> 19:50.939
you got to ask him for a couple of those
Chester Bucks, you know what I mean?

19:51.023 --> 19:53.233
- You know Chester Bucks aren't real…
- Here we go!

19:53.317 --> 19:55.777
- Hot off the printer.
- Alright, alright.

19:55.861 --> 19:59.531
10 million Chester Bucks.
With your face on 'em!

19:59.615 --> 20:01.742
- Oh, they look great!
- So cool!

20:01.825 --> 20:04.244
Well, we'd love to have some,
though, if that'd be--

20:04.328 --> 20:08.749
No can do because I don't want to devalue
the currency by flooding the market.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.000
Okay. Listen, I got a plan.

20:10.083 --> 20:11.084
Got you. I'm on it.

20:11.168 --> 20:13.503
So listen, Chester-- Oh, my God.
Foreign invaders!

20:13.587 --> 20:15.214
- What?
- Go, go, go! Get your ass--

20:15.297 --> 20:18.050
Hey, that's my money! That's my money!

20:18.133 --> 20:20.802
Hey! You give me back my money!

20:22.471 --> 20:25.557
Can you pick me up a Wetzel's Pretzel?

20:26.600 --> 20:31.188
<i>Now, 10 million C-bucks richer,</i>
<i>it was time to talk to our final suspect,</i>

20:31.271 --> 20:33.440
<i>the troubled middle triplet, Chadd,</i>

20:33.523 --> 20:38.362
<i>a failed influencer who was holed up</i>
<i>at the elite Chateau Magnifique Hotel.</i>

20:38.445 --> 20:40.280
All right, here's what I know about Chadd.

20:40.364 --> 20:43.033
Cora cut off Chadd's money years ago,

20:43.116 --> 20:46.912
but he's still able to run up some debts
on the family name.

20:46.995 --> 20:50.874
Now… She's dead, so he's about to get
a chunk of that inheritance.

20:50.958 --> 20:55.045
For me, that says motive in spades.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.298
Is that why I got
this weird ass vest on me?

20:58.382 --> 21:00.926
Yeah, here we go. Okay, you ready?

21:01.009 --> 21:03.762
Now, you're going to go undercover

21:03.845 --> 21:07.099
as a dealer in Chadd's
weekly blackjack game. It's fine.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.225
I don't know how to fucking deal.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.269
It's okay. You're a smart guy.

21:10.352 --> 21:11.520
Fuck.

21:11.603 --> 21:13.563
Just wear this earpiece. You see this?

21:13.647 --> 21:15.399
Wear this earpiece, put it in there,

21:15.482 --> 21:17.943
and you just say
exactly what I tell you to say.

21:18.026 --> 21:19.319
And everything will be fine.

21:19.403 --> 21:20.654
- Yeah, you'll be fine.
- Like James Bond.

21:20.737 --> 21:22.072
Yeah. Be like James Bond.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.074
- I can be a spy.
- I got you. You know that, right?

21:24.157 --> 21:25.075
You got my back, right?

21:25.158 --> 21:28.453
I got you and I will never
do anything to surprise you.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.290
- You're on!
- Hey, where the fuck you going?

21:33.125 --> 21:36.295
- Yo! Come on in. Come on in, brah.
- Thank you.

21:36.378 --> 21:37.337
What's up, Chief? How you doing, man?

21:37.421 --> 21:39.589
What's up? What's up?

21:39.673 --> 21:41.425
Yeah, there's your dealer table
right there.

21:41.508 --> 21:43.176
All right. All right.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.137
Um…

21:45.220 --> 21:46.471
Right, alright.

21:46.555 --> 21:48.140
You're not my usual dealer.

21:48.223 --> 21:51.268
No, that guy got cast in a movie musical.

21:51.351 --> 21:53.603
No, that guy got cast in a movie musical.

21:53.687 --> 21:54.771
Which movie musical?

21:54.855 --> 21:56.440
<i>It's called "The Adventures…</i>

21:56.523 --> 22:00.736
It's called "The Adventures
of Little Willie What's-a-Face-as

22:00.819 --> 22:02.946
<i>- And his Magic Canoe.</i>
- and his Magic Fucking Canoe."

22:03.030 --> 22:06.950
Oh, wow. That sounds like a super dope
movie. Who does he play in the movie?

22:08.035 --> 22:09.911
<i>- Tommy Tune.</i>
- Tommy Tune.

22:09.995 --> 22:12.039
I doubt that, but okay.

22:12.122 --> 22:15.542
Tommy Tune
taps his way all over the canoe.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.753
Tommy--

22:19.629 --> 22:22.215
Tommy Tune
taps his way all over the canoe.

22:22.299 --> 22:25.052
I don't think the kids would want to see
that but I believe what you're telling me.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.053
- Alright.
- Hey, look,

22:26.136 --> 22:28.930
I don't trust people that don't do shots.
You want one?

22:29.014 --> 22:30.849
<i>I only do shots of warm gin.</i>

22:30.932 --> 22:32.851
I only do shots of warm gin.

22:32.934 --> 22:34.061
<i>With a splash of root beer.</i>

22:34.144 --> 22:35.520
And a splash of root beer.

22:35.604 --> 22:37.522
Coming right up, coming right up.

22:37.606 --> 22:38.774
- Alright.
- There you go.

22:38.857 --> 22:42.778
Ow, ow, ow. My calf implant.
Here you go.

22:42.861 --> 22:45.655
All right, to my mother.

22:45.739 --> 22:50.952
May she R.I.P.
after she gives me some of that money!

22:51.036 --> 22:52.245
Yeah! Woo!

22:52.329 --> 22:53.538
<i>Oh, man.</i>

22:53.622 --> 22:54.289
Oh, man.

22:54.372 --> 22:56.249
<i>You seem really happy</i>
<i>that your mother's dead.</i>

22:56.333 --> 22:58.585
You seem really happy
that your mother's dead.

23:00.003 --> 23:00.962
Come on over, guys.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.090
Hey, this shot for real, though?
I can really take this shit?

23:03.173 --> 23:04.591
Yeah, you can drink that.

23:05.425 --> 23:09.346
Um… By the way, I didn't even catch
your name, dog. What is your name?

23:09.429 --> 23:11.264
<i>- It's…</i>
- It's…

23:12.390 --> 23:13.683
Octavius…

23:13.767 --> 23:15.310
Octavius…

23:15.894 --> 23:17.521
Shitwagon.

23:19.898 --> 23:20.857
Sh--

23:20.941 --> 23:22.609
Don't laugh when I tell you this.

23:23.193 --> 23:24.236
Shitwagon.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.862
Octavius Shitwagon?

23:25.946 --> 23:27.739
<i>- Yeah, it's Dutch.</i>
- Yeah, it's Dutch.

23:27.823 --> 23:29.574
That's a super strong name, man.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.243
- <i>And French.</i>
- And French.

23:31.326 --> 23:32.410
It's Dutch and French.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.955
More on the Dutch-French-y side.

23:35.038 --> 23:36.998
<i>Marshawn, sounds like you need my help.</i>

23:37.082 --> 23:40.669
I'm coming in. I'll be in disguise.
You probably won't even recognize me.

23:41.711 --> 23:44.172
I really like to go by my last name.

23:44.256 --> 23:45.799
- Shitwagon?
- Yeah.

23:45.882 --> 23:48.093
Cool. That's cool by me, dog.

23:48.176 --> 23:50.011
Hey, why don't we play some cards?

23:50.095 --> 23:52.180
- Let's fuck with it.
- Okay. Deal 'em up.

23:53.890 --> 23:55.308
Yo, come on in.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.106
What's up players?

24:03.150 --> 24:04.901
This motherfucker's smooth as hell.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.990
Sorry. Sorry, dog. Who are you?

24:11.283 --> 24:13.743
Come on, man.

24:14.494 --> 24:18.206
It's your boy,
noted influencer Toby Porkman.

24:18.290 --> 24:21.042
Marshawn, it's me in disguise.

24:21.126 --> 24:24.087
- I got you, boss.
- Okay. All right, give me some chippities.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.088
So should I deal him in?

24:25.172 --> 24:26.673
- Yes, let's play some cards!
- Yeah, I want some chips.

24:26.756 --> 24:29.134
- Give him fifty thousand.
- Yeah, fifty.

24:29.217 --> 24:31.219
Just like us.
You're good for 50 thou, right?

24:31.303 --> 24:34.264
Uh, duh! On a bad night I am.

24:34.347 --> 24:35.265
- Alright.
- Are you kidding me?

24:35.348 --> 24:37.517
- Fifty thou.
- You lucky tonight is a good night.

24:37.601 --> 24:40.145
- Fifty thou.
- Go ahead and hit me.

24:40.228 --> 24:41.813
You need a hit too?

24:41.897 --> 24:44.357
Ah, fucking Shitwagon!

24:44.441 --> 24:47.235
That just cost me twenty thou, dog!

24:47.319 --> 24:51.656
- Hey, hey, hey! Easy on the shit, dog.
- Shitwagon!

24:54.409 --> 24:58.330
So mad right now. Man,
I hate it when I lose at cards and stuff.

24:58.413 --> 25:00.916
Shitwagon,
get him to come back to the table.

25:00.999 --> 25:03.168
Excuse me, young fella, you mind
coming and parking it, right here?

25:03.251 --> 25:06.087
I apologize, bros.
I just don't like losing at cards.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.882
It's okay, dog. You got another
opportunity. Go on ahead.

25:08.965 --> 25:10.717
Oh, yeah. Sorry about that, bros.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.053
For sure. I want to get
into some card betting and okay,

25:13.136 --> 25:15.263
I lost. I take that
and I'm out of roundies,

25:15.347 --> 25:17.933
but I'm going to grab some
of those reds. The red ones.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.477
You don't grab chips.
Okay? That's real money.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.480
I just gave Octavius
my chips and he's got it all, so--

25:23.563 --> 25:26.107
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Stop the game.

25:26.191 --> 25:29.694
You don't know how to play blackjack
and I don't remember you.

25:29.778 --> 25:33.156
And also, how did you know his name
was Octavius Shitwagon?

25:33.240 --> 25:34.449
We didn't introduce you.

25:35.450 --> 25:36.493
We're homicide detectives!

25:36.576 --> 25:37.452
- Fuck!
- What?

25:37.535 --> 25:39.621
Cops? Get him Kaiser, get him Zion.

25:39.704 --> 25:40.997
Not so fast!

25:41.081 --> 25:43.625
Take it easy. Take it easy on the hats.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.210
You leave these fedoras alone!

25:45.293 --> 25:48.129
We're gonna walk out of here
real nice and easy. You got that?

25:48.213 --> 25:51.049
Bro, bro, you can walk out of here,

25:51.132 --> 25:55.095
you just leave the rest of those hats
and I'll forget about the fifty thousand.

25:55.178 --> 25:57.931
Get out of here!
You guys look cool as shit, by the way.

25:59.140 --> 26:00.475
You be cool.

26:00.558 --> 26:02.310
Your card game sucked.

26:03.270 --> 26:04.104
Prick.

26:04.187 --> 26:06.189
Shitwagon!

26:06.856 --> 26:09.067
<i>Our investigation was over,</i>
<i>and it was time</i>

26:09.150 --> 26:11.987
<i>for Marshawn to decide</i>
<i>who he thought the killer was.</i>

26:12.070 --> 26:14.239
<i>We lured all three triplets</i>
<i>to Cora's mansion</i>

26:14.322 --> 26:16.116
<i>under the guise of a will reading.</i>

26:17.826 --> 26:20.537
<i>One of the Worthington triplets</i>
<i>was about to inherit</i>

26:21.413 --> 26:23.081
<i>life in prison.</i>

26:25.792 --> 26:27.877
Could I have your attention?

26:27.961 --> 26:30.380
My partner here, Marshawn,

26:30.463 --> 26:36.761
is about to read something that is going
to change somebody's life.

26:36.845 --> 26:39.806
Is it Charles, Chester?

26:41.182 --> 26:43.518
Or Chadd Worthington?

26:43.601 --> 26:46.021
Marshawn, do the honors.

26:46.104 --> 26:47.564
Let's see what we got here.

26:50.066 --> 26:51.109
Mmm.

26:51.943 --> 26:56.364
I, Cora Worthington, being of sound mind
and body,

26:56.948 --> 26:59.951
hereby declare
that I was murdered by my son…

27:05.832 --> 27:06.624
Charles.

27:06.708 --> 27:09.669
What? Pfft.

27:09.753 --> 27:12.547
What exactly is going on here?

27:12.630 --> 27:16.926
Well, Chief, it looks like Marshawn
just cracked the case.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.845
It was Charles, of course.

27:18.928 --> 27:19.929
Bullshit!

27:20.013 --> 27:23.266
Marshawn, what exactly
convinced you it was Charles?

27:23.350 --> 27:24.351
For one…

27:25.477 --> 27:30.148
Seeing this man coming out of the house
with that same damn black hoodie on.

27:30.231 --> 27:34.527
We sat him down on investigations,
he couldn't spell for shit.

27:34.611 --> 27:37.489
So I will tell you, I did something
that I normally don't do:

27:37.572 --> 27:39.366
put all my eggs in one basket.

27:40.909 --> 27:42.577
And I got that motherfucker.

27:42.660 --> 27:46.956
Marshawn Lynch, you are 100%…

27:50.293 --> 27:51.211
Incorrect.

27:51.294 --> 27:52.212
For real?

27:52.295 --> 27:55.340
The killer was obviously Chester.

27:55.423 --> 27:56.257
No way!

27:56.341 --> 27:57.425
Aw, shit.

27:57.509 --> 28:02.806
We know that whoever murdered Cora
was left-handed, wore a black hoodie,

28:03.348 --> 28:06.935
was a bad speller,
and called his mother "Mom."

28:07.018 --> 28:07.894
Mom.

28:07.977 --> 28:09.562
Charles wore a black hoodie,

28:09.646 --> 28:14.025
<i>but wrote right-handed and only</i>
<i>referred to his mother as Cora.</i>

28:14.109 --> 28:18.613
Cora was a mean old woman.
Write that down.

28:18.696 --> 28:20.490
And it couldn't have been Chadd.

28:20.573 --> 28:23.701
- He punched the wall with his right hand.
- Yeah, I seen that.

28:23.785 --> 28:26.454
Shitwagon!

28:26.538 --> 28:28.623
But Chester called Cora "Mom."

28:28.706 --> 28:32.460
Mom and my brothers
took their eyes off the prize.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.796
Had the hoodie in his bunker…

28:36.089 --> 28:37.424
All right. All right.

28:37.507 --> 28:39.092
Was a terrible speller.

28:39.175 --> 28:41.344
I'm designing my own currency.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.680
I'll be the richest man
in the whole world.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.265
And most importantly,

28:45.348 --> 28:48.935
<i>swung the bat left-handed.</i>

28:49.853 --> 28:51.938
Chester was the killer.

28:52.564 --> 28:54.107
Take him out of here, officers.

28:54.190 --> 28:57.235
- Oh, come on! Right now?
- Right now.

28:57.902 --> 28:59.195
- Bro.
- I got stuff to do!

28:59.279 --> 29:00.155
Bro.

29:00.238 --> 29:01.823
- This is not cool.
- Get the fuck outta here.

29:01.906 --> 29:03.032
- What?
- Get up outta here.

29:03.116 --> 29:05.744
Hey, I demand to be deported back
to my home country

29:05.827 --> 29:07.287
- of Chester World.
- Go ahead. Get your ass outta here.

29:07.370 --> 29:11.249
You're about to be deported back
to jail… world.

29:11.332 --> 29:12.584
- That was a good one.
- Facts.

29:12.667 --> 29:14.544
- Marshawn Lynch?
- Yes.

29:14.627 --> 29:16.171
You are fired.

29:17.380 --> 29:19.424
How am I gonna get fired and I'm--

29:19.507 --> 29:21.551
Well, Marshawn, don't take it too hard.

29:21.634 --> 29:24.512
Well, I guess you not
the only one that got fired by her.

29:24.596 --> 29:25.680
That's right.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.432
She probably ran circles around here, huh?

29:27.515 --> 29:28.725
Yeah, she kicked my ass.

29:28.808 --> 29:31.311
Well, you know what, boss,
I apologize, man. I let you down.

29:31.394 --> 29:32.520
You never let me down.

29:32.604 --> 29:33.480
I let you down.

29:33.563 --> 29:36.107
You're one of the best
goddamn partners I've ever had.

29:36.191 --> 29:37.317
Do you mean that?

29:37.400 --> 29:38.818
Of course I mean that,
because you know why?

29:38.902 --> 29:41.154
No matter what, you always had my back.

29:41.821 --> 29:43.114
I appreciate that.

29:47.202 --> 29:48.620
- Wow.
- Fuck.

29:48.703 --> 29:52.123
All right. Well, we had a hell of a run.

29:52.207 --> 29:54.334
And we'll always have incredible memories.

29:55.752 --> 29:58.379
You're right about that. But boss…

29:58.463 --> 30:00.548
Sorry. I thought
they were going to freeze. Yeah?

30:02.759 --> 30:04.677
<i>On the next episode</i>
<i>of</i> Murderville…

30:04.761 --> 30:07.764
Terry, this is your new partner,
Kumail Nanjiani.

30:07.847 --> 30:09.933
I need you to take a psychopath test.

30:10.016 --> 30:11.434
Psychopath test?

30:11.518 --> 30:15.230
Your undercover name is
Cornelius Weinerbottom.
