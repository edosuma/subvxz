00:16.370 --> 00:17.451
<i>The Wolf.</i>

00:17.476 --> 00:19.597
- Where is he?
- She doesn't know.

00:19.660 --> 00:20.756
You wanna be the devil?

00:20.781 --> 00:22.062
Then do the devil's work.

00:22.914 --> 00:25.569
Run away like you've
always run all your life.

00:29.830 --> 00:31.031
You will be well, son.

00:31.137 --> 00:33.208
Father.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.224
You sure this will be satisfactory?

00:38.249 --> 00:39.810
She will be unconscious
within two breaths.

00:39.896 --> 00:40.976
And then?

00:41.001 --> 00:42.452
And then she'll be yours, old boy.

00:42.477 --> 00:45.856
You seek to violate us
and call it a kindness.

00:45.881 --> 00:46.553
Don't!

00:46.578 --> 00:49.061
I don't take orders from any man.

00:49.110 --> 00:50.871
I fear Justine does not know her place.

00:50.896 --> 00:54.084
She has the very heart of who
I was before I was this.

00:54.109 --> 00:58.041
All of Brona's shame and debasement.

00:58.066 --> 00:59.202
Let me do it.

00:59.227 --> 01:00.388
Lily...

01:00.418 --> 01:01.459
No.

01:02.222 --> 01:03.622
<i>You are in my debt.</i>

01:03.647 --> 01:04.864
I will call on it.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.842
There's a creature hunting me.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.428
Does this creature have a name?

01:08.453 --> 01:10.013
He's called Dracula.

01:10.038 --> 01:11.865
If Dracula wanted you dead,

01:11.890 --> 01:12.678
you would be.

01:12.703 --> 01:14.023
He doesn't want my death.

01:14.048 --> 01:15.405
He wants my submission.

01:15.430 --> 01:17.711
Nothing you have said
has scared me away.

01:17.736 --> 01:19.136
And I will not leave your side.

01:19.252 --> 01:20.813
Every time I've given my heart,

01:20.838 --> 01:22.678
<i>it has led to catastrophe.</i>

01:22.794 --> 01:24.842
<i>Then let
catastrophe befall us both.</i>

Was it a girl?

02:05.018 --> 02:06.019
Ma'am.

02:07.447 --> 02:08.689
Yes, ma'am.

02:10.989 --> 02:12.591
My little girl it was...

02:13.903 --> 02:15.344
She was.

02:20.180 --> 02:22.182
My heart breaks for you.

02:28.705 --> 02:29.906
Please know

02:31.320 --> 02:33.642
that the day a good woman

02:33.667 --> 02:37.471
will have to undergo such
indignity is almost past.

02:39.452 --> 02:42.975
We will not have to suffer,
our children to starve

02:43.850 --> 02:47.694
and freeze and die
dishonored on cold hills.

02:49.871 --> 02:51.953
We will not be hungry forever.

02:54.464 --> 02:56.025
We will rise.

03:09.113 --> 03:12.076
And know that your daughter
rests in good company.

06:58.887 --> 07:00.328
It's morning.

07:02.187 --> 07:04.710
I haven't slept so well in years.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.689
I hope it was the company.

07:12.637 --> 07:15.439
Now, not to put too fine a point on it,

07:15.464 --> 07:17.024
but it might be advisable for us

07:17.025 --> 07:19.106
to vacate the premises
before the staff arrives.

07:20.389 --> 07:22.511
There's no rush, and I have tea brewing.

07:24.339 --> 07:25.860
You're too good.

07:29.998 --> 07:32.040
I hope you always think that.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.031
Miss Ives.

08:06.475 --> 08:07.796
Mr. Clare.

08:11.842 --> 08:13.764
I'm in need of a friend.

08:16.284 --> 08:19.688
The accident, as you
see, left me disfigured.

08:23.692 --> 08:26.495
What dare I hope for
acceptance from my family?

08:28.056 --> 08:30.779
How can they bring this
beast into their lives?

08:32.020 --> 08:33.260
I see no beast.

08:33.650 --> 08:36.014
I see a kind and loving man.

08:36.705 --> 08:38.226
A father and a husband.

08:39.836 --> 08:41.236
Once.

08:41.269 --> 08:43.952
Shouldn't you give them the
chance to love you again?

08:45.313 --> 08:47.516
People are better than we think.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.480
Do you believe that?

08:53.281 --> 08:54.563
Almost.

09:01.169 --> 09:02.531
Mr. Clare...

09:04.453 --> 09:05.694
John.

09:08.457 --> 09:10.778
There was time when we
were thrown together

09:10.779 --> 09:12.340
at very close quarters.

09:13.542 --> 09:15.143
Do you remember?

09:20.165 --> 09:21.286
No.

09:23.752 --> 09:26.555
The Banning Clinic, off the Strand.

09:33.044 --> 09:34.205
No.

09:37.646 --> 09:38.966
You used to work there.

09:38.967 --> 09:40.489
Before your accident.

09:41.810 --> 09:44.493
I don't recall. I'm sorry.

09:48.937 --> 09:51.459
You were very kind to me once.

09:51.460 --> 09:53.542
And I loved you for it.

09:54.383 --> 09:56.825
The man I knew deserves to be loved.

09:58.587 --> 10:00.308
And the man you see?

10:00.869 --> 10:02.230
No less.

10:07.636 --> 10:08.917
And you?

10:10.959 --> 10:13.241
Have you found something like happiness?

10:19.408 --> 10:23.043
That's like a strange tune,

10:23.572 --> 10:25.453
unknown to me.

10:25.454 --> 10:27.776
I'm trying to sound out the measures.

10:29.257 --> 10:30.539
Join the dance.

10:35.904 --> 10:37.865
We both should.

10:37.866 --> 10:40.348
We have been unhappy long enough.

10:43.369 --> 10:45.371
No matter the consequences?

10:46.150 --> 10:47.339
Let us dare.

10:49.037 --> 10:50.519
And if we're rejected?

10:51.427 --> 10:53.549
Can we be more lonely than we are now?

11:01.898 --> 11:04.180
Then let us dare.

11:06.895 --> 11:10.619
And may the lost souls be found.

11:29.848 --> 11:31.530
What do you do now?

11:34.058 --> 11:35.500
I go with you.

11:35.957 --> 11:38.039
You will need allies
for the battle ahead.

11:39.642 --> 11:40.843
There is no battle.

11:41.929 --> 11:44.051
The goddamn battle is done.

11:46.495 --> 11:49.136
You may want to fight on until
the sun falls from the sky

11:49.137 --> 11:51.058
the last fucking Apache,

11:51.059 --> 11:54.301
and more power to you,
pal, but I'm done.

11:54.302 --> 11:58.467
You may be done with Hell,
but it is not done with you.

12:02.538 --> 12:03.619
Your way,

12:04.633 --> 12:07.034
the way of this place, of this land,

12:07.035 --> 12:08.437
of my father,

12:09.638 --> 12:11.960
has brought nothing but blood.

12:13.602 --> 12:15.243
I can't live with it anymore.

12:15.884 --> 12:17.284
There was a moment in my life

12:17.285 --> 12:19.086
where I had a chance for
something different.

12:19.087 --> 12:21.329
A woman offered me her heart.

12:21.970 --> 12:23.612
A woman I love.

12:23.732 --> 12:25.534
And I walked away.

12:26.855 --> 12:28.816
I have to try to make that right.

12:28.817 --> 12:30.337
So you're in love.

12:30.446 --> 12:33.371
What I am is clear of this
place once and for all.

12:33.396 --> 12:35.730
Of my father. And you.

12:36.745 --> 12:39.293
And you let your people go so easily?

12:39.318 --> 12:40.519
My people?

12:41.550 --> 12:44.112
Those bloody ghosts back at the ranch?

12:45.273 --> 12:48.036
The tribe on the
reservation in Oklahoma?

12:50.318 --> 12:51.600
No.

12:52.641 --> 12:54.722
My people are in London now.

12:54.723 --> 12:57.646
That man inside there. That
woman I told you about.

12:58.457 --> 12:59.698
My friends.

13:00.409 --> 13:01.649
That is my tribe.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.532
Your words are air.

13:03.892 --> 13:05.333
They mean nothing.

13:06.054 --> 13:09.418
You have a future you cannot escape.

13:11.339 --> 13:15.584
You will always be my father,
Kaetenay of the Hills.

13:37.861 --> 13:40.454
_

13:41.282 --> 13:46.287
_

13:47.456 --> 13:48.537
I am not an Apache.

13:49.057 --> 13:50.338
You are.

13:51.139 --> 13:52.821
I have claimed you.

13:55.824 --> 13:57.986
I've purchased three
tickets to New York.

13:58.827 --> 14:00.469
From there you can decide.

14:16.745 --> 14:17.746
No!

14:18.567 --> 14:20.248
He's been touched.

14:31.660 --> 14:33.382
I never should've left you.

14:34.022 --> 14:35.303
Not ever.

14:37.185 --> 14:38.827
But I'm back now.

14:43.205 --> 14:44.887
It's too late.

14:55.444 --> 14:57.005
What did you see?

15:00.168 --> 15:03.812
You, a stinging fog,

15:04.212 --> 15:05.414
unclean,

15:06.695 --> 15:08.617
a woman who loves you.

15:10.175 --> 15:11.577
Pale skin.

15:12.901 --> 15:14.423
Raven hair.

15:15.744 --> 15:16.945
In danger.

15:17.866 --> 15:19.388
She's in danger.

15:58.106 --> 16:00.469
There's an old tale, from Ireland,

16:00.949 --> 16:02.591
where I once lived.

16:04.352 --> 16:08.076
We have there an ancient
tradition of keening.

16:10.358 --> 16:11.760
After a death,

16:13.522 --> 16:15.964
the old women gather together

16:17.566 --> 16:22.250
and sing the most poignant
and beautiful lamentations.

16:24.666 --> 16:27.108
It's a way to sing the
soul to a better place,

16:28.517 --> 16:32.331
a place of divine peace or rapture even.

16:33.088 --> 16:35.810
But several years ago,

16:35.944 --> 16:37.985
the old men of the Catholic Church

16:37.986 --> 16:42.790
decided they did not approve
of this pagan practice

16:42.791 --> 16:46.154
as it circumvented their
rituals and mysteries.

16:47.836 --> 16:49.598
So they convinced the court

16:50.639 --> 16:54.122
to arrest these good, true women

16:55.243 --> 16:56.885
and put them on trial.

16:59.007 --> 17:00.448
Of course, they were found guilty

17:00.449 --> 17:01.970
and sentenced to death.

17:04.132 --> 17:06.013
So the women were led to the gallows,

17:06.655 --> 17:08.056
all in a row.

17:11.019 --> 17:13.502
And as the ropes were tightened
around their throats,

17:15.183 --> 17:16.905
they began to keen.

17:18.787 --> 17:22.511
And as they fell and as
their necks snapped,

17:23.392 --> 17:25.714
their song echoed for a moment,

17:29.117 --> 17:32.120
sounding their way to immortality.

17:46.895 --> 17:49.978
My doomed, keening women.

17:52.381 --> 17:54.142
Shall we be immortal?

17:55.143 --> 17:57.706
Shall we sing from the gallows, too?

17:59.107 --> 18:02.229
We must have the faith of those women.

18:02.230 --> 18:05.152
We must have their
strength and commitment.

18:05.153 --> 18:07.676
We must be bloody or nothing else!

18:10.959 --> 18:13.081
And now you must prove

18:13.682 --> 18:16.164
your commitment to our great cause.

18:20.609 --> 18:21.850
Go now.

18:23.091 --> 18:24.853
Every one of you.

18:25.614 --> 18:26.895
Rise up.

18:27.576 --> 18:29.017
Rise up!

18:30.739 --> 18:33.902
Go into those dark streets
you know so well,

18:35.303 --> 18:38.105
those foul alleys and secret back lanes

18:38.106 --> 18:40.068
and find me a bad man!

18:41.830 --> 18:43.671
A faithless husband.

18:43.672 --> 18:45.152
A cruel lover.

18:45.153 --> 18:46.794
A rich despot.

18:46.795 --> 18:49.196
A scrofulous john fucking
some girl just like you,

18:49.197 --> 18:51.559
and quick with the back of
his hand while he's at it.

18:51.560 --> 18:54.802
Find him and bring me his right hand!

18:54.803 --> 18:55.804
Yes!

18:56.364 --> 18:59.488
Cut it off and hold it
bleeding to your breast!

19:00.048 --> 19:02.169
Bring it here, fling it on this table,

19:02.170 --> 19:04.291
and we shall sing out our joy!

19:06.094 --> 19:07.575
Prove yourselves to me!

19:10.098 --> 19:12.140
Prove yourselves to me!

19:52.140 --> 19:53.181
Marjorie?

20:00.469 --> 20:01.830
Marjorie?

20:21.009 --> 20:22.250
My wife.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.255
No.

20:30.218 --> 20:32.180
I am returned to you.

21:10.338 --> 21:13.141
There is much you will
not credit, I know.

21:13.782 --> 21:15.784
It has been torturous for me,

21:17.105 --> 21:19.508
crowded with unlikely incident,

21:22.230 --> 21:24.072
but that is my story.

21:27.155 --> 21:29.798
And this man, this doctor,

21:30.999 --> 21:32.801
took away your memory of us?

21:34.242 --> 21:36.124
That wasn't his intention.

21:37.606 --> 21:40.568
He had no goal beyond resurrection,

21:40.569 --> 21:42.210
at which he's excelled.

21:44.092 --> 21:47.335
It was the consequences
therein that escaped him.

21:48.417 --> 21:50.378
He created life,

21:50.379 --> 21:52.541
but had no care for its nurturing.

21:54.222 --> 21:56.505
A young man's ambition to be known,

21:57.546 --> 21:59.027
not to be good.

22:02.551 --> 22:04.352
He has brought you back to us.

22:05.313 --> 22:06.555
For this I bless him.

22:08.276 --> 22:10.038
But not as I was.

22:11.800 --> 22:13.041
How not?

22:14.483 --> 22:15.604
This?

22:17.365 --> 22:18.687
And this?

22:24.733 --> 22:26.294
They are not you.

22:30.058 --> 22:31.179
I've...

22:35.143 --> 22:37.025
I've done cruel things.

22:39.267 --> 22:40.428
I've been unworthy

22:40.429 --> 22:42.751
and hurt those who didn't deserve it.

22:44.833 --> 22:46.715
A kind of madness, call it.

22:47.636 --> 22:48.637
And...

22:50.919 --> 22:52.641
Bottomless rage.

22:56.244 --> 22:58.285
The sun will never
shine so bright for me

22:58.286 --> 23:00.689
now that I have walked in darkness.

23:03.331 --> 23:05.414
I cannot be the man I was.

23:07.736 --> 23:09.337
You were lost.

23:10.539 --> 23:12.421
And now you are home.

23:16.224 --> 23:17.305
Husband.

23:58.547 --> 24:00.348
Will you dance with me?

24:01.510 --> 24:03.031
You're otherwise engaged, I think.

24:03.912 --> 24:06.154
Ever so charming, aren't you?

24:06.715 --> 24:08.757
All charm and nothing but.

24:09.758 --> 24:12.601
Might come a day, my lad,
when that ain't enough.

24:14.322 --> 24:16.123
And are you to choose that day?

24:16.124 --> 24:17.846
You wanted a killer.

24:18.567 --> 24:20.207
You got her.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.289
Can't go back now.

24:27.616 --> 24:29.057
Listen, child.

24:30.459 --> 24:32.380
I can toss you out like
the baggage you are

24:32.381 --> 24:33.622
whenever it pleases me.

24:34.342 --> 24:35.903
And don't think for one moment

24:35.904 --> 24:39.106
your tiresome sapphic
escapades shock me.

24:39.107 --> 24:41.390
You think you're bold?
You think you know sin?

24:41.990 --> 24:43.110
You're still learning the language.

24:43.111 --> 24:44.231
I wrote the bloody book.

24:47.355 --> 24:49.838
You want to play with me, kitten?

24:50.719 --> 24:52.481
Then show me your claws.

25:10.939 --> 25:13.541
I'm sorry, darling.
She's very emotional.

25:13.542 --> 25:14.583
You don't mind?

26:12.721 --> 26:14.762
Sorry I'm late, darling.

26:14.763 --> 26:15.884
Are you well?

26:16.445 --> 26:19.767
Tolerable. I had half that orange.

26:23.251 --> 26:24.493
Jack.

26:25.374 --> 26:27.376
Someone's come to see us.

26:28.457 --> 26:29.778
Come home, I mean.

26:35.824 --> 26:37.626
You must prepare for a shock.

26:38.627 --> 26:42.190
Quite a strange and wonderful
thing that's happened.

26:45.193 --> 26:48.036
And we're all going to
be very, very happy.

26:49.758 --> 26:51.199
What is it?

27:07.496 --> 27:08.817
Jack.

27:18.747 --> 27:19.868
Son.

27:36.525 --> 27:39.408
Gonna need help with
that rigging, I think.

29:16.344 --> 29:17.946
Tell me about this woman.

29:19.668 --> 29:21.390
She's very strong.

29:24.593 --> 29:25.874
And in pain.

29:27.195 --> 29:28.437
Why?

29:29.678 --> 29:31.800
Her life's been challenging.

29:33.682 --> 29:35.043
Cursed.

29:37.846 --> 29:41.249
Does she have a feeling for
things not of this earth?

29:43.091 --> 29:44.252
Yes.

30:53.041 --> 30:54.843
Don't be afraid, Vanessa.

30:55.363 --> 30:56.884
Who are you?

30:56.885 --> 30:58.607
I am with your friends.

30:59.488 --> 31:01.169
Sir Malcolm and...

31:01.730 --> 31:03.812
You know him as Mr. Chandler.

31:06.254 --> 31:07.416
Ethan?

31:08.537 --> 31:09.897
We are coming to you.

31:09.898 --> 31:11.580
You must hurry.

31:12.381 --> 31:13.662
He is very close.

31:14.783 --> 31:16.024
The Dragon.

31:17.666 --> 31:18.707
I feel him.

31:20.268 --> 31:23.472
You study the end of things.

31:23.912 --> 31:26.274
Plagues of illness and death.

31:26.995 --> 31:28.716
"And then all light will end

31:28.717 --> 31:31.278
and the world will live in darkness.

31:31.279 --> 31:33.721
The very air will be
pestilence to mankind."

31:33.722 --> 31:36.044
Is this your prophesy, woman?

31:36.685 --> 31:39.607
Don't speak these words or
you may bring them to life.

31:39.608 --> 31:40.928
I'm no witch.

31:42.451 --> 31:43.772
You know nothing of me.

31:44.252 --> 31:47.975
You are a great, fertile bitch of evil

31:47.976 --> 31:52.220
and I love you for your
fertility and your power.

31:53.141 --> 31:56.544
You are the woman of all our dreams

31:56.545 --> 31:59.468
and all our night terrors.

31:59.828 --> 32:02.911
All the Night Creatures
are gathering around you.

32:03.191 --> 32:06.313
See the moonlight catching
the raven's wing.

32:06.314 --> 32:08.156
The sheen on the fox's pelt.

32:09.077 --> 32:12.760
The scent in the air when
night birds take wing.

32:12.761 --> 32:14.883
They make you drunk with love.

32:15.884 --> 32:19.286
Don't be deceived by them, Vanessa Ives.

32:19.287 --> 32:21.129
They are false lovers.

32:22.971 --> 32:24.853
And if I know anything,

32:26.415 --> 32:27.815
it is this.

32:27.816 --> 32:30.819
You are made for the day,

32:32.180 --> 32:33.502
not the night.

32:34.903 --> 32:36.665
There, sir,

32:37.906 --> 32:39.227
you are wrong.

32:46.274 --> 32:48.677
She is halfway his already.

32:49.918 --> 32:51.279
Who?

32:52.360 --> 32:54.002
The Dragon.

32:57.005 --> 33:00.728
What influence you have,
whatever money you can use,

33:00.729 --> 33:03.972
talk to the captain, tell
him to put on all speed.

33:09.858 --> 33:11.259
Oh, I'm tired.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.360
_

33:13.385 --> 33:17.248
_

33:18.845 --> 33:20.759
_

33:27.588 --> 33:31.330
_

33:31.595 --> 33:37.338
_

33:37.363 --> 33:42.003
_

33:44.165 --> 33:48.076
_

33:48.493 --> 33:51.040
_

33:55.103 --> 33:58.587
_

34:11.119 --> 34:13.040
<i>"Give me your flesh.</i>

34:13.041 --> 34:14.882
<i>Give me your blood.</i>

34:14.882 --> 34:16.884
<i>Be my bride.</i>

34:16.885 --> 34:20.408
<i>One kiss and you're free of all this.</i>

34:20.409 --> 34:21.889
<i>In this mortal world</i>

34:21.889 --> 34:25.092
<i>you will always be shunned
for your uniqueness,</i>

34:25.092 --> 34:26.775
<i>but not with me.</i>

34:27.775 --> 34:31.018
<i>They will lock you away
in rooms like this</i>

34:31.018 --> 34:34.742
<i>they will brand you as a
freak and a sorceress,</i>

34:34.743 --> 34:36.023
<i>but I won't."</i>

34:36.375 --> 34:37.817
Jesus.

34:41.670 --> 34:43.310
Like to give me a damn heart attack.

34:43.311 --> 34:44.433
What are you doing here?

34:44.953 --> 34:47.594
Foolish me, left my billfold in my desk.

34:47.596 --> 34:48.877
You're working late.

34:50.358 --> 34:53.120
- It's driving me mad.
- What's that?

34:53.121 --> 34:53.962
Miss Ives.

34:55.563 --> 34:56.724
So far as I can tell,

34:56.725 --> 34:58.566
she's a genuine split personality.

34:58.567 --> 34:59.928
Very rare.

35:01.249 --> 35:02.450
In this one session

35:02.451 --> 35:04.612
she manifests three distinct people.

35:04.613 --> 35:06.375
Really? Which people?

35:09.257 --> 35:10.419
Go on home now.

35:13.702 --> 35:16.103
You look like you could use some sleep.

35:16.104 --> 35:17.807
You're awfully pale. Are you sick?

35:18.387 --> 35:20.629
Oh, just a touch of the ague.

35:21.269 --> 35:23.711
I'll be right as rain soon,
right as rain, yes I will.

35:23.712 --> 35:25.634
Right as rain will I be, yes.

35:29.077 --> 35:30.238
Good night, Doctor.

35:59.668 --> 36:00.988
Miss Hartdegen.

36:00.989 --> 36:04.032
It's Catriona, please. Or for you, Cat.

36:04.192 --> 36:06.033
As in cat o' nine tails.

36:06.034 --> 36:08.196
As you say. And it's Vanessa.

36:13.041 --> 36:17.486
I have some new information
on our friend, the Dragon.

36:18.447 --> 36:20.008
This way please.

36:22.971 --> 36:26.174
As you see, I've been doing
my own research on Dracula.

36:27.095 --> 36:29.698
Sadly, almost every
assumption you have is wrong.

36:30.739 --> 36:32.059
But I, I've been...

36:32.060 --> 36:35.383
Superstition, myth, and
unfounded prejudice

36:35.384 --> 36:36.785
informs every page here.

36:37.466 --> 36:40.267
These are small-minded
peasants and poets

36:40.268 --> 36:42.830
and theologians trying to make sense

36:42.831 --> 36:45.794
of something utterly
inexplicable to them.

36:46.715 --> 36:48.235
So they invent

36:48.236 --> 36:50.399
any assumptions to fit their fears.

36:51.159 --> 36:53.801
Dracula can't walk by day,

36:53.802 --> 36:55.883
he doesn't cast a reflection,

36:55.884 --> 36:57.445
he can only be slain

36:57.446 --> 36:59.366
by a stake of consecrated ash wood.

36:59.367 --> 37:00.489
There's no sense to any of that.

37:01.490 --> 37:03.691
You may as well read the
<i>Bible</i> for its history

37:03.692 --> 37:05.373
which, it goes without saying,

37:05.374 --> 37:08.696
is a fool's errand fit
only for idiot children.

37:08.697 --> 37:11.098
Then how am I to find out who he is?

37:11.099 --> 37:12.980
Start with what he's given you.

37:12.981 --> 37:14.341
How has he presented himself?

37:14.342 --> 37:17.184
As a Fallen Angel, brother to Lucifer.

37:17.185 --> 37:19.186
Then take that to be truth.

37:19.187 --> 37:21.870
He was cast to Earth, to live among us,

37:22.711 --> 37:25.753
assuming different identities
over the centuries

37:25.754 --> 37:29.077
to protect himself, unnoticed,

37:30.879 --> 37:32.120
until he strikes.

37:33.241 --> 37:34.803
And when he does?

37:37.406 --> 37:39.007
That you know.

37:40.889 --> 37:44.051
"The very air will be
pestilence to mankind."

37:44.052 --> 37:47.175
"And the Night Creatures
will emerge and feed."

37:51.620 --> 37:53.181
The End of Days

37:54.222 --> 37:58.146
is the one universal
constant in thanatology.

37:59.187 --> 38:02.630
All men, all cultures that
have ever trod the earth,

38:02.631 --> 38:04.272
have foreseen the Apocalypse.

38:05.273 --> 38:07.155
But no matter the language,

38:08.276 --> 38:10.198
the drama always ends the same way.

38:11.319 --> 38:14.362
The curtain falls on a
stage bedecked with bodies

38:15.964 --> 38:18.286
and there is nothing but silence.

38:20.208 --> 38:23.251
And death holds all dominion.

38:31.580 --> 38:33.662
I suspect you could use some tea.

38:36.144 --> 38:38.226
I could use some whiskey more.

38:47.636 --> 38:49.236
But if all the lore is a fantasia

38:49.237 --> 38:50.999
of rival superstitions,

38:51.720 --> 38:53.241
how will I ever know him?

38:54.322 --> 38:57.085
How can I defeat an unknowable wraith?

38:58.407 --> 39:02.971
In his human form he can be
killed like anyone else.

39:03.652 --> 39:06.094
A bullet, a blade, it
makes no difference.

39:06.775 --> 39:08.776
And in his inhuman form?

39:08.777 --> 39:11.299
No one's ever lived to tell the tale.

39:12.020 --> 39:13.461
You'll be the first.

39:13.462 --> 39:16.064
You're very confident we'll defeat him.

39:18.226 --> 39:19.748
Hmm, not "we."

39:20.389 --> 39:21.229
You.

39:26.755 --> 39:28.596
I come from Highland stock,

39:28.597 --> 39:29.678
an old clan,

39:30.879 --> 39:33.441
and was practically raised
with a claymore in one hand,

39:33.442 --> 39:36.405
so much did my father want
the son he never got.

39:37.446 --> 39:39.728
And I'll be honest with you,

39:41.129 --> 39:44.012
I've done my share of
butchering over the years.

39:46.294 --> 39:48.336
But this, my darling,

39:50.218 --> 39:52.861
this is not the work of a soldier.

39:53.301 --> 39:55.664
It's the work of a spy.

39:56.905 --> 39:59.948
You must get close enough to
look into his damned eyes.

40:00.909 --> 40:03.311
And then have the grit to do it.

40:05.233 --> 40:06.635
Then help me.

40:07.195 --> 40:08.397
How can I find him?

40:09.237 --> 40:10.959
He's a tactician above all.

40:11.199 --> 40:13.441
He'll approach you with
stealth and strategy,

40:13.442 --> 40:15.362
not a frontal assault.

40:15.363 --> 40:17.886
He'll seduce you, not attack you.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.288
And most of the legends
agree on a few points.

40:21.289 --> 40:23.130
His human form is unexceptional,

40:23.131 --> 40:25.052
so that he may walk easily among us.

40:25.053 --> 40:27.455
He's served by semi-human familiars

40:27.456 --> 40:29.618
and he's said to dwell in the
House of the Night Creatures.

40:32.381 --> 40:33.461
What was that?

40:33.462 --> 40:35.743
He's said to live in the House
of the Night Creatures,

40:35.744 --> 40:40.348
which is probably symbolic for
any number of sinister things.

40:49.357 --> 40:50.439
Vanessa?

40:51.920 --> 40:54.763
Any blade or bullet?

40:55.484 --> 40:56.684
What?

40:56.685 --> 40:58.086
Will kill him?

40:59.488 --> 41:00.689
Yes.

41:07.496 --> 41:09.378
You know who he is.

41:11.820 --> 41:13.421
Are you familiar with Shelley?

41:13.422 --> 41:15.303
The poem <i>Alastor?</i>

41:15.624 --> 41:16.745
No.

41:18.627 --> 41:22.430
"I have made my bed In
charnels and on coffins,

41:22.431 --> 41:25.714
where Black Death keeps
record of the trophies won."

41:36.605 --> 41:37.845
I feel I haven't had a moment

41:37.846 --> 41:39.407
alone with you in weeks.

41:39.408 --> 41:41.609
I'm sorry, darling.
It's been particularly mad.

41:41.610 --> 41:44.132
Ha! It has been mad.

41:45.093 --> 41:47.375
We've unleashed the
inmates, have we not?

41:47.376 --> 41:48.976
All the Bedlamites come home to roost.

41:48.977 --> 41:51.499
But my women are not mad, Dorian.

41:51.500 --> 41:53.542
Nor are they "your" women.

41:56.465 --> 41:59.828
More and more you're a
lion tamer at the circus.

42:00.108 --> 42:03.391
Ooh, spoken like a man.

42:03.392 --> 42:04.912
All women are "cats"

42:04.913 --> 42:08.275
and prone to backstabbing
and treachery, is that it?

42:08.276 --> 42:09.637
Is it all mankind you despise,

42:09.638 --> 42:11.480
or just men?

42:12.040 --> 42:14.483
And when do you turn your eye on me?

42:15.043 --> 42:16.816
Don't be silly. You're my beloved.

42:17.045 --> 42:20.409
Where are our dances in the
midst of your revolution?

42:20.849 --> 42:22.330
Where are our whispers and collusions?

42:23.291 --> 42:26.494
Our exalted superiority,
shared with no others?

42:26.495 --> 42:28.416
You're not jealous?

42:28.417 --> 42:29.618
Sadly, no.

42:30.859 --> 42:33.702
What I am is bored.

42:36.865 --> 42:40.068
I've lived through so many
revolutions, you see.

42:41.189 --> 42:44.071
It's all so familiar to me.

42:44.072 --> 42:46.954
The wild eyes and zealous ardor,

42:46.955 --> 42:48.677
the irresponsibility, and the clatter.

42:49.478 --> 42:51.559
The noise of it all, Lily.

42:51.560 --> 42:53.561
From the tumbrils on the
way to the guillotine

42:53.562 --> 42:55.683
to the roaring mobs sacking
the temples of Byzantium.

42:55.684 --> 42:58.607
So much noise in anarchy.

42:59.528 --> 43:03.010
And in the end it's
all so disappointing.

43:03.011 --> 43:04.532
You're behaving like a spoilt child,

43:04.533 --> 43:05.973
which is exactly what you are.

43:05.974 --> 43:08.977
And you have disappointed
me most of all.

43:10.258 --> 43:12.901
We had the potential for true mastery,

43:13.942 --> 43:15.584
a cosmic darkness.

43:16.625 --> 43:18.507
What have you created?

43:19.828 --> 43:21.550
An army of depraved whores.

43:22.471 --> 43:25.353
A slave ship bound for a ruinous shore.

43:26.154 --> 43:27.916
And will you be there when it founders?

43:29.197 --> 43:31.599
We're at the ebb tide, my darling.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.562
One of us needs to change our ways.

43:34.202 --> 43:35.604
And I think it should be you.

44:09.037 --> 44:10.639
Lily.

44:12.561 --> 44:15.564
Lily, breathe deeply,

44:16.324 --> 44:17.725
you're all right.

44:17.726 --> 44:19.007
You're safe here.

44:20.889 --> 44:22.010
Victor?

44:23.932 --> 44:25.494
Hello, darling.

44:27.215 --> 44:28.457
Glad you're awake.

44:29.738 --> 44:32.781
Miss Lily, pleased to
make your acquaintance.

44:34.703 --> 44:35.983
Where am I?

44:35.984 --> 44:37.705
Just stay calm, it'll
take a few minutes for...

44:37.706 --> 44:39.227
Where am I?

44:41.910 --> 44:43.151
You're in Bedlam.

44:50.519 --> 44:52.561
You fucking cunt.

44:53.962 --> 44:55.042
There, there.

44:55.043 --> 44:56.284
You betrayed me.

44:56.845 --> 44:58.085
You gave me to him! Calm down.

44:58.086 --> 45:00.414
You're still coming out of...

45:16.745 --> 45:17.826
You've chained me.

45:21.189 --> 45:22.670
It's for your own protection.

45:22.671 --> 45:24.312
It's for yours.

45:30.278 --> 45:31.960
What are you going to do to me?

45:32.761 --> 45:35.323
We're going to make you better.

45:37.125 --> 45:38.606
Better than what?

45:38.607 --> 45:40.528
He means we're going to make you well.

45:40.529 --> 45:43.131
- As you were before.
- As I was before what?

45:44.853 --> 45:46.094
Before.

45:46.695 --> 45:48.015
When we were happy.

45:48.016 --> 45:50.298
When you were happy, you mean.

45:52.220 --> 45:55.263
Lily, we're going to try
to make you healthy.

45:56.465 --> 45:58.306
Take away all your anger and pain

46:00.228 --> 46:02.591
and replace them with
something much better.

46:03.872 --> 46:07.676
- What?
- Calm, poise, serenity.

46:09.317 --> 46:10.759
We're going to make you

46:13.041 --> 46:14.963
into a proper woman.

46:34.342 --> 46:35.824
Do you want to be alone?

46:38.667 --> 46:39.668
Anything but.

46:42.671 --> 46:44.352
I wasn't made for ships.

46:44.833 --> 46:47.596
Only part of adventuring I abhorred.

46:48.997 --> 46:51.920
I should have abhorred leaving my family

46:52.961 --> 46:54.802
or the privations of the trail,

46:54.803 --> 46:56.644
but really it was only the ships.

46:56.645 --> 46:57.765
Oh, I know better.

46:57.766 --> 46:59.688
I know how much you
cared for your family.

47:00.409 --> 47:02.451
Only when it was too late.

47:02.931 --> 47:05.694
We prize things most
when we've lost them.

47:11.139 --> 47:12.740
I suppose I should thank you

47:12.741 --> 47:14.543
for what you did in the chapel.

47:16.625 --> 47:18.145
It was meant to be an act of mercy,

47:18.146 --> 47:19.267
was it not?

47:22.190 --> 47:23.351
Yes.

47:25.714 --> 47:27.876
I couldn't pull the trigger.

47:29.838 --> 47:31.559
I just couldn't do it.

47:31.560 --> 47:33.882
And for that you must be thankful.

47:34.763 --> 47:37.486
You've a soul left inside you, Ethan.

47:38.126 --> 47:40.248
You have some kindness.

47:40.929 --> 47:43.892
Never lose that or you'll...

47:45.934 --> 47:47.055
Or?

47:48.537 --> 47:49.898
Here I stand.

47:51.179 --> 47:53.622
And yet you have kindness still.

47:55.063 --> 47:57.666
You spared me the sin of patricide.

47:57.786 --> 48:01.109
No man should have to murder
a member of his own family.

48:01.990 --> 48:03.392
This I know.

48:13.121 --> 48:14.763
I honestly thought I could do it.

48:16.765 --> 48:18.887
End it with my father in blood.

48:20.529 --> 48:22.851
I am, as you know, no
stranger to killing.

48:25.854 --> 48:28.776
Or "night work" as
Miss Ives once put it.

48:29.898 --> 48:31.379
The night I met you, in fact.

48:31.380 --> 48:32.941
In the opium house.

48:34.302 --> 48:35.464
I remember.

48:37.866 --> 48:41.630
Given the chance to go back,
would you do it differently?

48:43.311 --> 48:44.993
Walk the other way?

48:46.755 --> 48:49.798
Never meet me, or her?

48:50.238 --> 48:52.880
You've seen what I come from,

48:52.881 --> 48:54.923
that dragon that raised me,

48:55.604 --> 48:57.285
that land that reared me.

48:58.847 --> 49:01.089
I've known very little grace in my life.

49:02.370 --> 49:03.972
But I did with her.

49:05.414 --> 49:06.895
And with you.

49:14.903 --> 49:16.785
Good night, Mr. Chandler.

51:28.757 --> 51:31.520
The House of
the Night Creatures.

51:32.040 --> 51:33.280
Where you are loved.

51:33.281 --> 51:36.083
- Stop it.
- Where you belong.

51:36.084 --> 51:38.326
You're more cruel than
I could have imagined.

51:38.967 --> 51:40.409
How am I cruel?

51:41.850 --> 51:43.250
To love you?

51:43.251 --> 51:46.134
You've lied to me from the first moment.

51:46.535 --> 51:47.976
You tore my heart.

51:48.016 --> 51:50.137
Have I lied?

51:50.138 --> 51:52.500
You met a man who marvels

51:52.501 --> 51:54.703
wide-eyed at the miracles of nature.

51:55.544 --> 51:56.785
So I am.

51:58.106 --> 52:01.629
You met a man who has
known pain and tragedy.

52:01.630 --> 52:03.111
And so I am.

52:04.633 --> 52:07.034
You met a man who wanted to possess you

52:07.035 --> 52:10.158
for his own ends but, instead,

52:12.080 --> 52:13.842
he fell in love.

52:15.363 --> 52:17.606
That's the man I am,

52:18.927 --> 52:20.328
and the monster.

52:21.410 --> 52:23.452
Even now you twist at me.

52:25.053 --> 52:26.455
All the years.

52:27.055 --> 52:29.977
All the assaults on myself,

52:29.978 --> 52:31.139
on my friends.

52:31.900 --> 52:33.060
On my dear Mina,

52:33.061 --> 52:35.903
who died with your teeth on her throat!

52:35.904 --> 52:38.186
How dare you speak of love?

52:38.667 --> 52:40.027
Dare with me.

52:40.028 --> 52:43.551
I will not lower my head
and feed with the animals.

52:43.552 --> 52:45.673
I will never serve you.

52:45.674 --> 52:49.077
No, I don't want you
to serve me, Vanessa,

52:49.638 --> 52:51.359
I want to serve you.

52:52.360 --> 52:53.881
The Mother of Evil.

52:57.446 --> 52:59.207
What has my life been?

52:59.648 --> 53:02.930
A series of shabby
identities in vulgar worlds.

53:02.931 --> 53:04.572
From one tragic age to another.

53:04.573 --> 53:07.495
Always in search of that
one thing I cannot attain!

53:07.496 --> 53:09.057
Have mercy, please!

53:12.461 --> 53:14.221
This is the only mercy I can offer you.

53:14.222 --> 53:16.063
Then do it.

53:16.064 --> 53:18.626
Better to die now than walk
another day without you.

53:18.627 --> 53:20.107
So it's a love story, is it?

53:20.108 --> 53:21.710
You know it is.

53:22.991 --> 53:25.794
We have been shunned
in our time, Vanessa.

53:26.675 --> 53:29.076
The world turns away in horror.

53:29.077 --> 53:30.078
Why?

53:30.479 --> 53:32.040
Because we're different.

53:32.200 --> 53:33.681
Ugly.

53:33.682 --> 53:35.163
Exceptional.

53:35.764 --> 53:38.365
We're the lonely Night
Creatures, are we not?

53:38.366 --> 53:40.889
The bat, the fox,

53:42.090 --> 53:44.051
the spider, the rat.

53:44.052 --> 53:45.173
The scorpion.

53:46.174 --> 53:47.976
The broken things.

53:50.298 --> 53:51.860
The unloved.

53:54.262 --> 53:57.825
There's one monster who loves
you for who you really are.

53:57.826 --> 53:59.508
And here he stands.

54:00.228 --> 54:03.111
I don't want to make you good,
I don't want you to be normal.

54:09.317 --> 54:10.718
I don't want you to be anything

54:10.719 --> 54:12.200
but who you truly are.

54:23.572 --> 54:26.535
You have tried for so long

54:27.416 --> 54:29.698
to be what everyone wants you to be.

54:31.700 --> 54:33.742
What you thought you ought to be.

54:35.584 --> 54:38.305
What your church and your family

54:38.306 --> 54:41.308
and your doctors said you must be.

54:43.952 --> 54:47.516
Why not be who you are instead?

54:49.398 --> 54:50.919
Myself?

54:52.561 --> 54:54.843
You will never be alone again.

54:56.244 --> 54:59.367
I will love you till time
has lost all meaning.

55:00.489 --> 55:01.730
Yes.

55:04.533 --> 55:06.294
Do you accept me?

55:09.378 --> 55:13.021
I accept myself.

55:27.075 --> 55:30.277
<i>"And then all light will end</i>

55:30.278 --> 55:33.321
<i>and the world will live in darkness.</i>

55:34.563 --> 55:38.407
<i>The very air will be
pestilence to mankind.</i>

55:40.498 --> 55:44.262
<i>And our brethren, the Night Creatures,</i>

55:44.613 --> 55:47.135

55:48.428 --> 55:52.993
<i>Such is our power, such is our kingdom,</i>

55:53.942 --> 55:55.904
<i>such is my kiss."</i>
