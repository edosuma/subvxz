00:23.480 --> 00:25.130
Plot 332.

00:25.320 --> 00:26.401
This is it.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.202
Hey, what's going on here?

00:38.400 --> 00:39.481
Lose the shovel.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.402
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

00:44.120 --> 00:45.565
What are you doing here?

01:02.880 --> 01:05.042
Mr. Liao, pleasure to see you.

01:07.480 --> 01:08.840
What do we have today?

01:18.840 --> 01:20.524
Marjorie Lin
Twenty-four

01:20.960 --> 01:23.531
Unmarried
She was going for her PHD.

01:26.840 --> 01:27.887
Cause of death?

01:32.160 --> 01:33.207
Heart attack.

01:34.160 --> 01:36.401
No history of illness, or STDS.

01:36.640 --> 01:37.721
As requested.

01:39.720 --> 01:42.200
- How much?
- Thirty-seven thousand.

01:45.680 --> 01:46.727
I'll take it.

02:05.440 --> 02:08.205
You're going to be so pretty.

02:24.120 --> 02:25.804
I had the photo enhanced.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.964
It's a rough extrapolation of features...

02:29.160 --> 02:31.322
...since the face
was almost entirely blown out.

02:31.520 --> 02:33.124
Ran it through every FBI database.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.607
Facial recognition, mug shots,
surveillance feeds.

02:35.840 --> 02:38.081
Or just buy this boat,
and we could disappear.

02:39.520 --> 02:42.842
Do you know how many images are
in the NGI database? Fifty-one million.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.202
If we go away, none of that matters.

02:45.400 --> 02:48.882
Fifty-one million,
and not a single one of her.

02:49.200 --> 02:50.804
Reddington knows who she is.

02:51.000 --> 02:53.002
I know who she is.

02:53.440 --> 02:54.805
That girl, that's me.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.686
And the woman,
I believe that may be my mother.

02:59.360 --> 03:00.850
That mean Reddington's your dad?

03:01.040 --> 03:02.280
No.

03:02.480 --> 03:05.370
My father died when I was 4, in a fire.

03:05.560 --> 03:08.484
Reddington was there.
I think she may have been too.

03:09.120 --> 03:10.610
Why don't you just ask him?

03:10.800 --> 03:14.122
If Reddington wanted me to know
the truth, he would've told me by now.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.685
Wants to keep me from knowing.

03:15.920 --> 03:18.491
And he will bully anyone
who might help me into silence.

03:18.680 --> 03:22.207
Well, that's his tell, the silence.

03:22.400 --> 03:25.609
Berlin had me keep tabs on him,
or trying to.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.651
Mention of his name
was like I'd asked for their firstborn.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.208
He thinks fear protects him, but
fear he instills, silence can't hide it.

03:32.440 --> 03:34.920
You can see it in their eyes.

03:35.520 --> 03:38.330
Whenever I did,
I knew Reddington had been there.

03:40.160 --> 03:41.844
- What?
- That stamp.

03:42.040 --> 03:43.883
The ring, I've seen it before.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.206
- Where?
- Berlin.

03:45.400 --> 03:50.247
He wore a ring with that exact hallmark.
It's a Russian inspection stamp.

03:51.160 --> 03:53.367
You know people
who worked with Berlin.

03:53.720 --> 03:55.609
You could reach out.

03:58.840 --> 04:00.444
My apologies, Leonard.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.926
I intended to be earlier.

04:02.120 --> 04:04.361
You had a bullet removed
from your chest five days ago.

04:04.560 --> 04:06.847
It's a wonder you're here at all.

04:07.880 --> 04:10.690
I've configured an optical
character recognition program...

04:10.880 --> 04:13.531
...to create hard copies
of the data of the Fulcrum.

04:13.720 --> 04:17.007
That data's over 25 years old.
Much of it must be obsolete.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.964
Most of the key delegations are run
by the same players.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.970
The Director believes
there are many players on the board.

04:23.200 --> 04:26.488
He thinks a bipolar world
is inherently more stable.

04:26.680 --> 04:30.401
Whatever they're planning to accomplish,
it won't commence until 2017.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.489
Well, he's advancing the time line.

04:32.680 --> 04:35.843
And with Hobbs gone,
I've lost my man on the inside.

04:36.080 --> 04:38.048
We need to find Kenneth Jasper.

04:38.240 --> 04:41.801
He's one of the Director's closest allies.
He'll know what they're planning.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.571
I threatened to kill him
when he betrayed Roger Hobbs.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.371
More specifically,
I threatened to cut out his tongue...

04:47.560 --> 04:51.724
...and deliver it to the Director
personally. He won't be easy to find.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.401
But he's the best play.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.244
Swanky digs.

05:00.480 --> 05:04.326
Seeing as how you recently paid a visit
to my apartment in Bethesda...

05:04.520 --> 05:08.605
...you know I have a fondness
for the old and somewhat decrepit.

05:09.040 --> 05:12.362
Dembe asked me to go
to get the interface for the Fulcrum.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.801
He needed you to get the Fulcrum.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.771
He wanted you to discover secrets.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.083
Did you discover any secrets, Lizzy?

05:21.440 --> 05:23.204
What's that?

05:23.880 --> 05:26.167
Please help yourself.

05:30.840 --> 05:33.969
Identification documents for Lien Mah.

05:34.160 --> 05:35.810
Fake birth certificate.

05:36.160 --> 05:37.571
Fake passport.

05:39.160 --> 05:41.367
Death certificate.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.206
Proof of embalming.

05:44.440 --> 05:47.967
Everything necessary
to convince the U.S. State Department...

05:48.200 --> 05:50.567
...that Lien Mah
was a Chinese national...

05:50.760 --> 05:53.366
...who died
while visiting the United States...

05:53.560 --> 05:57.167
...and to arrange for her body's return
to her homeland.

05:57.360 --> 06:00.170
Who would ship
a fictitious Chinese corpse to China?

06:00.360 --> 06:02.966
A rather clever smuggler, I imagine.

06:03.160 --> 06:08.326
So if Lien Mah is fake, then whose body
are they shipping overseas?

06:11.200 --> 06:14.647
"Marjorie Lin, 24, was laid to rest
Monday afternoon.

06:14.840 --> 06:18.811
Not 10 hours later, her body was stolen
in a brazen midnight grave robbery."

06:19.000 --> 06:21.810
You think the smuggler
is using Marjorie Lin's body?

06:22.000 --> 06:25.049
Compare the photo
on Lien Mah's false passport...

06:25.280 --> 06:27.487
...to the photo of Marjorie Lin
in the paper.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.041
Same woman.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.764
But why this case? What's your angle?

06:35.200 --> 06:38.488
This smuggler also has business
with the Cabal.

06:38.960 --> 06:42.646
- The Cabal?
- The Taiwan festival bombing in 2011.

06:42.880 --> 06:45.406
Thirty-two dead, nine injured.

06:45.600 --> 06:48.251
The IED that took out the convoy...

06:48.440 --> 06:51.205
...headed to the Chinese consulate
in Jakarta last year...

06:51.400 --> 06:52.765
...another 17 dead.

06:52.960 --> 06:55.281
Both were engineered by the Cabal.

06:55.480 --> 06:59.371
And this same smuggler was used
to transport those explosives...

06:59.600 --> 07:01.170
...to their final destinations.

07:01.360 --> 07:03.283
You wanna target one of their assets?

07:03.720 --> 07:06.644
I went to the Director,
showed him the Fulcrum...

07:06.840 --> 07:08.285
...restored the détente.

07:08.480 --> 07:11.609
The détente is over, Lizzy.

07:11.960 --> 07:13.883
What you know
about the Fulcrum...

07:14.120 --> 07:16.771
...what the Director now knows
you know?

07:16.960 --> 07:21.488
By saving me, you revealed yourself
to be a potent enemy...

07:21.680 --> 07:27.210
...a target they will try to discredit
or destroy.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.883
The smuggler.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.367
We need to find the smuggler.

07:32.560 --> 07:37.088
So we obtained a list from State of all the
foreign nationals who died on U.S. soil...

07:37.280 --> 07:39.726
...and were repatriated back
to their home countries.

07:39.920 --> 07:42.491
- Of these, seven in particular stood out.
- How so?

07:42.680 --> 07:45.001
Passports were forged
using fictitious names...

07:45.200 --> 07:48.807
...just like the documentation that
Mr. Reddington provided on Marjorie Lin.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.331
Who were these women really?

07:50.520 --> 07:54.081
Marjorie Lin, a.k.a. Lien Man,
wasn't the only body that was stolen.

07:54.320 --> 07:57.563
We were able to match forged photos
with seven grave robberies...

07:57.760 --> 08:00.161
...in which the bodies
were Asian females under 35.

08:00.560 --> 08:01.686
Chinese, to be specific.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.087
And all were shipped
to various cities in China.

08:04.280 --> 08:06.009
Do we know
who received the shipments?

08:06.200 --> 08:09.443
I contacted Chinese authorities.
They're launching an investigation.

08:09.640 --> 08:12.928
We doubt they'll come up with much.
Given the forged paper trails...

08:13.120 --> 08:15.851
...my bet is these funeral parlors
don't even exist.

08:16.040 --> 08:17.769
Based on this guy's track record...

08:17.960 --> 08:20.691
...there's a chance
he was moving explosives in caskets.

08:20.880 --> 08:23.201
As soon as our suspect
files the paperwork...

08:23.440 --> 08:26.125
...authorizing transportation of Lien Mah
back to China...

08:26.320 --> 08:29.369
...we'll know the flight number,
and we can go seize the casket.

09:01.640 --> 09:04.211
- That's enough for today.
- Just one more lap, Raymond.

09:04.400 --> 09:07.768
- This is an important part of your therapy.
- You should have let me die.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.566
Nobody told me
about this aimless walking.

09:10.760 --> 09:12.569
- Jasper's gone.
- How gone?

09:12.760 --> 09:15.650
Canceled all meetings
and fled in his Gulf stream four days ago.

09:15.960 --> 09:19.328
Bogus flight plan.
No record of any visas issued.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.204
Not as much as a passport swiped.

09:22.240 --> 09:26.006
Call Alex and Barton.
Book them a flight to Key West.

09:28.360 --> 09:31.443
Jasper's yacht is docked
at the Admiral's Club Marina.

09:31.640 --> 09:33.449
A Benetti Romanza.

09:35.760 --> 09:38.127
Barton can pass for Jasper
from a distance.

09:38.320 --> 09:42.484
Go aboard, take her out a mile or two,
blow her up.

09:42.720 --> 09:46.520
Dembe will make it appear
to be a death by misadventure.

09:46.720 --> 09:51.203
Tip off Frasier at The Journal
and Brenda Short at Holford Capital.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.762
Stock in Jasper's conglomerate...

09:53.960 --> 09:56.361
...Century View Media
will start hemorrhaging...

09:56.560 --> 09:59.643
...as soon as news
of his tragic disappearance goes viral.

10:04.760 --> 10:08.810
Within hours, he'll have to hold
a press conference to stem the bleeding.

10:09.040 --> 10:12.442
And then we'll have his location,
or at least a starting point.

10:12.640 --> 10:14.324
And if he decides to ride it out?

10:14.520 --> 10:17.729
He has two viciously rapacious
ex-wives.

10:17.920 --> 10:19.763
A Brazilian bull shark of a mistress...

10:19.960 --> 10:22.645
...and a thoroughbred ranch
south of Ocala...

10:22.840 --> 10:24.569
...that's a bottomless money pit.

10:24.760 --> 10:26.364
He'll turn up.

10:32.440 --> 10:36.445
If you're gonna keep stopping by like this,
we should consider getting you an office.

10:36.640 --> 10:38.483
I'm getting sworn in tomorrow, Harold.

10:38.680 --> 10:40.170
I'm aware. Big day.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.566
You're damn right.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.366
I've been getting calls
from The Times, from The Post.

10:44.560 --> 10:48.201
There were witnesses. People think
it was Reddington who was shot.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.447
People know it was him.

10:49.640 --> 10:53.167
We can deal with rumors. What's harder
is proof, and there isn't any.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.887
Press believes a fugitive from the FBI's
most wanted list was here in D.C.

10:57.080 --> 10:59.845
Looks like I don't know anything.
It gives the impression...

11:00.040 --> 11:03.840
...I'm more focused on transitioning
into the job than doing the job.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.770
I want this handled.

11:06.600 --> 11:09.126
- How do you suggest I do that?
- A reporter at The Post.

11:09.320 --> 11:10.731
His name is Josh Mandell.

11:10.920 --> 11:13.002
I want you to leak him something,
anything.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.646
A redacted operational report
to Reven Wright.

11:15.840 --> 11:19.845
Just enough to convey that my office and
the FBI are all over the Reddington case.

11:20.680 --> 11:25.607
You're asking me to fabricate
and then leak a classified document.

11:26.240 --> 11:27.526
Yes.

11:27.840 --> 11:30.650
It's public relations, Harold.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.243
Lien Mah's body was delivered
to Dulles.

11:33.440 --> 11:36.011
The casket's scheduled
to be on Flight 241 to Beijing.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.282
Contact airport authority.
Stop that flight.

11:38.480 --> 11:40.847
Make sure casket doesn't make it
to the cargo hold.

11:41.040 --> 11:42.849
Get an EOD team to meet us on site.

11:44.280 --> 11:46.248
I just heard from Reddington.
He wants to meet.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.602
- About what?
- He won't say.

11:48.800 --> 11:52.168
He's still worried about leaks.
I'll have to catch up with you later.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.404
Our preliminary x-rays didn't reveal
any explosive material...

11:55.600 --> 11:59.844
...or objects with a density common
to C4 or other incendiary plastics.

12:00.040 --> 12:02.771
We won't know what we got for sure
till we get inside.

12:02.960 --> 12:05.566
To be safe,
we're gonna let the robot crack it.

12:13.640 --> 12:15.768
That's definitely Marjorie Lin.

12:16.720 --> 12:18.722
- Interior looks clear.
- That's not possible.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.884
Our intel says that something's
being smuggled in that casket.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.807
What if what we're looking for
isn't in the casket?

12:25.000 --> 12:28.800
What if he's brazen enough
to hide the contraband in the body itself?

12:29.000 --> 12:30.923
We're not gonna open that body.

12:31.120 --> 12:34.040
No one wants to put this woman through
anything more than she's endured...

12:34.200 --> 12:37.488
...but I'm afraid
we're going to have to insist.

12:38.120 --> 12:41.408
You know, when I was... When I was
a kid, I wanted to race motorcycles.

12:41.600 --> 12:45.286
And my mom said, "No, Jeffrey.
Go into medicine. It's safe."

12:46.200 --> 12:48.407
Thanks a lot, Mom. All right.

12:48.600 --> 12:51.046
Here we go. Helmet on. Okay, yeah.

12:51.240 --> 12:52.730
Whoo.

12:54.240 --> 12:55.571
Okay.

12:56.760 --> 12:57.921
Okay.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.646
Definitely should not have had tuna
for lunch.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.041
Wish me luck.

13:03.920 --> 13:05.285
Okay.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.448
Here we go. Nice and easy.

13:07.680 --> 13:11.048
Nice and easy.

13:11.960 --> 13:13.200
All right.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.961
I'm gonna open her up by cutting
along the path of the previous incision.

13:17.520 --> 13:19.045
Here we go.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.210
I'm in.

13:22.840 --> 13:26.242
All of the internal organs appear normal,
post-embalmment.

13:26.440 --> 13:30.923
Nothing here appears
to be out of the ordinary.

13:31.160 --> 13:34.721
She's clean. In fact, she's immaculate.

13:34.920 --> 13:39.084
This is one of the most impeccably
preserved bodies I have ever seen.

13:40.160 --> 13:41.889
We're clear.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.004
Did the same thing last month.

14:02.360 --> 14:04.840
It's probably why
you don't recognize me.

14:05.760 --> 14:07.410
Konstantin.

14:09.880 --> 14:12.087
Berlin, man, he's tough.

14:12.280 --> 14:16.763
I had to get away for a while,
go to Germany, figure a few things out.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.651
I come here for the peace and quiet.

14:20.880 --> 14:23.611
Sure. Sorry.

14:24.200 --> 14:27.409
Gosh, you know,
I just thought maybe you could help me.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.682
He said to piss off, pal.

14:30.440 --> 14:31.805
Just take a minute.

14:39.760 --> 14:40.966
I don't know who that is.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.920
I think you do.

14:45.840 --> 14:47.683
Why don't you take another look?

14:57.040 --> 14:59.042
We got a problem.

15:03.320 --> 15:04.401
Let him go.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.883
- You okay?
- Yeah.

15:09.080 --> 15:11.765
- I believe he was asking for a name.
- I can't.

15:12.480 --> 15:14.323
I swore on my life I wouldn't.

15:14.520 --> 15:15.851
You swore to whom?

15:38.840 --> 15:41.366
Son of a bitch.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.763
Who's Bill Kershaw?

15:46.520 --> 15:49.251
Where is it? I know it's here.

15:49.440 --> 15:54.207
That's how you knew I was here,
how you knew I saw the picture.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.607
It's why you threatened people.

16:06.120 --> 16:08.361
The important thing is
for our stockholders...

16:08.560 --> 16:11.848
<i>...to understand
that I am alive and well.</i>

16:12.040 --> 16:15.169
And we understand that
you've lined up a series of interviews...

16:15.360 --> 16:18.364
...so that you can reassure...
- Call Hollenbeck in Boston.

16:18.560 --> 16:21.643
I want a surveillance team
outside that station when Jasper leaves.

16:21.840 --> 16:24.810
We should find out from Dr. Rentovitch
if I'm cleared to fly.

16:27.600 --> 16:30.331
Where are you? Where are you?
Where are you?

16:33.680 --> 16:34.727
Raymond.

16:34.920 --> 16:37.605
... want to be reassured
that this company is stable.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.087
Hello, Mr. Kershaw.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.530
I saw your name on the mailbox.

16:45.040 --> 16:48.283
I know you're listening.
You know how I know?

16:49.160 --> 16:55.566
Because this is where you keep
all of your secrets.

16:55.760 --> 16:57.922
You don't want anyone
finding those out, do you?

16:59.640 --> 17:06.171
Well, unless you answer my questions,
I'm gonna find every last one.

17:10.400 --> 17:11.526
Let me have your phone.

17:18.880 --> 17:23.363
You've made your point, Agent Keen.
It's time we discuss the photograph.

17:30.400 --> 17:32.767
The girl is you.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.682
And the woman is your mother.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.045
What was her name?

17:46.240 --> 17:49.449
I knew her as Katarina Rostova.

17:49.680 --> 17:51.284
One of her many names.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.767
She was a KGB agent.

17:57.160 --> 18:00.801
The girl, the night of the fire,
they called her...

18:01.000 --> 18:02.047
Masha.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.686
You were born in Moscow.

18:05.080 --> 18:08.243
Your parents... Father and...

18:09.440 --> 18:11.886
They were both in foreign intelligence.

18:12.080 --> 18:14.560
You said she died of weakness
and shame.

18:14.920 --> 18:16.445
Yeah.

18:17.200 --> 18:20.488
You were there that night.
I need to know what happened.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.569
You want to know.

18:23.880 --> 18:25.689
There's a difference.

18:26.800 --> 18:30.885
Dr. Orchard told me someone
blocked my memory of that night.

18:31.080 --> 18:32.491
Was it you?

18:33.120 --> 18:34.690
Yes.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.804
Why?

18:40.320 --> 18:42.049
I'm not going to tell you.

18:42.240 --> 18:46.768
You have a picture of my mother
in your weird little apartment.

18:47.800 --> 18:49.325
Why?

18:50.880 --> 18:53.008
Were you in love with her?

18:53.840 --> 18:56.411
Is that why my father died?

18:57.000 --> 19:00.049
You killed him because
you were in love with my mother?

19:05.600 --> 19:07.090
Tell me what happened.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.044
Please.

19:13.080 --> 19:16.004
I'm not gonna tell you what happened,
Lizzy.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.485
Then I'll find out for myself.

19:37.120 --> 19:38.451
What's on your mind?

19:40.760 --> 19:45.800
Tom Connolly wants me to leak intel
to the press.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.729
What kind of intel?

19:48.200 --> 19:49.406
Classified.

19:51.200 --> 19:54.124
I should have said no,
but I get the distinct impression...

19:54.320 --> 19:58.166
...that my position in this clinical trial
is contingent on doing him favors.

19:59.040 --> 20:02.601
So do them. I mean, don't people
leak information all the time?

20:03.120 --> 20:04.565
You hear what I said?

20:04.800 --> 20:06.643
He's leveraging my health, my life.

20:06.840 --> 20:09.525
Harold, you're a decent man...

20:09.720 --> 20:11.245
...the man I fell in love with.

20:11.480 --> 20:14.484
And now you're asked
to do something indecent.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.931
But if you are telling me
that your life depends...

20:18.120 --> 20:20.964
...on whether Tom Connolly gets
what he wants...

20:21.160 --> 20:23.049
...you know my opinion.

20:24.680 --> 20:26.205
I do.

20:27.880 --> 20:29.370
And you know mine.

20:31.800 --> 20:33.529
Reddington said that the smugglers...

20:33.720 --> 20:36.291
...facilitated several terrorist incidents
in the past.

20:36.480 --> 20:39.051
Had to have been transporting
something in that casket.

20:39.240 --> 20:40.526
Wasn't drugs or explosives.

20:40.760 --> 20:42.922
Maybe it was the stolen bodies
themselves.

20:43.480 --> 20:46.962
Guys, come here. Check this out.

20:48.600 --> 20:50.682
Photo on the left was taken
by the coroner...

20:50.880 --> 20:53.167
...who pronounced Marjorie Lin dead
five days ago.

20:53.360 --> 20:56.409
The one on the right was taken
at the airport yesterday.

20:57.160 --> 20:59.322
- Notice anything?
- Their teeth are different.

20:59.520 --> 21:02.842
Bingo. When she died,
Marjorie Lin didn't have veneers.

21:03.040 --> 21:04.610
Her teeth were fixed postmortem?

21:04.800 --> 21:07.565
And that is not easy to pull off,
given the time frame.

21:07.760 --> 21:11.367
Process normally takes weeks. Miss Lin's
body was only taken two days ago.

21:11.560 --> 21:13.164
According to Danover Labs...

21:13.360 --> 21:15.840
...the order was delivered
to a Dr. Henry McGlasson.

21:16.080 --> 21:19.243
I dug a little deeper into this guy
and contacted the medical board.

21:19.440 --> 21:23.331
3230 Kettering Drive.

21:23.800 --> 21:26.167
How'd it go with Reddington?
He have any insights?

21:26.360 --> 21:29.045
No, but I did.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.163
My face is out there.

21:31.360 --> 21:34.682
I've done five interviews
in the last four hours.

21:34.880 --> 21:38.965
The reporting has been corrected. It'll just
take time for the share price to recover.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.686
The front desk called.
The radio people are here.

21:42.440 --> 21:44.090
Put Theelan on it.

21:44.320 --> 21:48.564
Tell him to flog his boy from the SEC
and get it done.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.724
We'll be wheels up again in two hours.

21:51.920 --> 21:54.571
I'll do the video uplink in the air.

21:56.040 --> 21:57.485
Hello, Kenneth.

21:57.680 --> 22:01.241
Regrettably, your interview
has been canceled, but don't fret.

22:01.440 --> 22:05.650
I'm quite certain my questions
will be much more provocative.

22:15.880 --> 22:17.882
FBI. Hands where I can see them.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.723
You're standing
in front of a ghost bride.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.281
- Come again. A what?
- It's an outlawed folk custom.

22:44.480 --> 22:46.244
Chinese form of ancestor worship.

22:46.440 --> 22:49.091
When a family member dies,
the relatives are obligated...

22:49.280 --> 22:50.884
...to tend to that person's needs.

22:51.080 --> 22:54.163
If they die unmarried, they'll find
themselves alone on other side.

22:54.360 --> 22:58.649
And unhappy spirits tend to come back
and haunt their living relatives.

22:58.840 --> 23:00.888
- What are the paper dolls for?
- The ceremony.

23:01.200 --> 23:04.124
The family crafts a doll
for the deceased groom, as well.

23:04.360 --> 23:07.728
After which, the female's remains
are buried alongside the deceased male.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.321
Believe it or not,
with all the women in China...

23:10.520 --> 23:13.364
...young, attractive,
unmarried female corpses are rare...

23:13.560 --> 23:16.769
...which would explain why our suspect
exported bodies from the U.S.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.686
I'm sorry, but this guy
digs up bodies in America...

23:19.880 --> 23:22.281
...then he sends them back to China
to be reburied?

23:22.480 --> 23:23.811
Mail-order corpse brides.

23:24.040 --> 23:27.681
Selected based on age, lineage,
education, attractiveness.

23:27.920 --> 23:30.241
And that explains the veneers.

23:30.440 --> 23:33.046
This one was clearly crafted
to resemble Marjorie Lin.

23:33.240 --> 23:38.610
Same general features,
but it begs the question: Who's this one?

23:39.400 --> 23:41.926
They're gonna steal another body.

23:44.720 --> 23:46.210
Agent Navabi.

23:46.440 --> 23:49.603
I imagine you're knee-deep
in pilfered corpses at the moment.

23:49.800 --> 23:51.723
But right now I require a woman...

23:51.920 --> 23:56.005
...with your particular experience
and training.

24:10.000 --> 24:11.490
What?

24:22.360 --> 24:26.081
There must be over a hundred
thousand dollars in this case.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.922
Heads up, Kenneth.

24:32.120 --> 24:34.088
I'm afraid I mean quite literally.

24:34.320 --> 24:38.120
I'm gonna need you to keep your head up
for this next part.

24:38.320 --> 24:40.322
It's bad news, old boy.

24:40.520 --> 24:41.567
I know.

24:41.760 --> 24:44.491
A few days ago,
I offered to crown you king...

24:44.680 --> 24:47.126
...and now here you sit.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.163
Well, the road not taken.

24:49.360 --> 24:51.362
This is Agent Navabi.

24:51.560 --> 24:56.805
She was trained by Mossad
in enhanced interrogation techniques.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.287
I thought you two
should have a little visit.

25:06.080 --> 25:07.525
Why don't we get started?

25:08.960 --> 25:11.440
I analyzed the money you found
in the ceiling tile...

25:11.640 --> 25:13.404
...and found a couple of anomalies.

25:13.600 --> 25:17.491
Turns out the cash is worth a lot more
than the 100 grand the bills represent.

25:17.680 --> 25:18.920
How is that even possible?

25:19.160 --> 25:22.243
All the serial numbers start
with A888...

25:22.440 --> 25:24.408
...and none of them
include the number 4.

25:24.600 --> 25:27.524
In Cantonese
and most regional Chinese dialects...

25:27.720 --> 25:30.121
...the word for "four"
sounds like the word "death."

25:30.320 --> 25:32.368
What does that have to do
with the bills?

25:32.560 --> 25:36.246
It is statistically impossible to have
this many bills and not have any fours...

25:36.440 --> 25:40.001
...unless, of course, the bills were
printed specifically without any fours.

25:40.200 --> 25:42.931
- You're saying they're counterfeit.
- Prosperity notes...

25:43.120 --> 25:45.088
...worth about 5 bucks to every dollar.

25:45.280 --> 25:48.124
Only one place you can buy
an entire batch of currency...

25:48.320 --> 25:50.163
...with this sort of customized detail.

25:51.920 --> 25:55.288
Whoever paid the suspect bought
the prosperity notes from U.S. Treasury.

25:55.480 --> 25:58.404
If we trace who bought the bills,
we might ID the next client.

25:58.600 --> 26:02.366
I already contacted the Treasury.
The buyer was one Mr. Chaoxiang Han.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.607
Kenda.

26:03.800 --> 26:05.962
I looked into this guy, and...
Thanks so much.

26:06.160 --> 26:09.004
...And we found this article
published last February.

26:09.200 --> 26:13.091
"Mr. and Mrs. Chaoxiang Han
mourned the loss of only son Jin...

26:13.280 --> 26:17.444
...the heir apparent
to the Han tech empire, worth billions."

26:17.680 --> 26:20.684
Says he committed suicide
after he was left at the altar...

26:20.880 --> 26:24.965
...by his fiancee, An Bai, after which she
emigrated to D. C. to live with her father.

26:25.160 --> 26:28.562
He works at the embassy.
She's currently attending Georgetown.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.205
An Bai is the next victim.

26:30.840 --> 26:34.162
But isn't she supposed to already
be dead? Isn't that how this works?

26:34.400 --> 26:37.290
Uh, the parents must blame her
for Jin's suicide.

26:37.480 --> 26:40.723
They're determined to make An Bai
his bride, if not in life, in death.

26:40.920 --> 26:44.891
You two head to An Bai's.
Get me the security office at Georgetown.

26:46.920 --> 26:48.763
Oh, my goodness.

26:50.400 --> 26:54.200
Remember that fantastic film
from the '70s, Marathon Man?

26:54.680 --> 26:56.409
Oh, my God, what a film.

26:56.600 --> 27:03.529
Laurence Olivier
as the ex-Nazi super bad guy/dentist.

27:03.760 --> 27:05.603
And Dustin Hoffman as...

27:06.240 --> 27:09.005
I think he was a graduate student,
wasn't he?

27:09.200 --> 27:13.603
Anyway, that interrogation scene,
oh, my gosh.

27:13.800 --> 27:18.488
Olivier drilling into Hoffman's teeth
right down into the nerve.

27:18.680 --> 27:20.762
Oh, God, I can just feel it.

27:20.960 --> 27:24.362
The screaming and writhing,
the sound of the drill.

27:24.560 --> 27:28.042
And, of course,
Hoffman delirious with pain...

27:28.240 --> 27:35.203
...saying anything, true or not,
just to stop the excruciating nightmare.

27:35.400 --> 27:37.004
"Is it safe?" "Yes, it's safe."

27:37.200 --> 27:39.931
"Is it safe?" "No, no, it's not safe!"

27:40.120 --> 27:41.565
You know, he'd say anything.

27:41.800 --> 27:43.848
And then that guy comes in...
What's his name?

27:44.040 --> 27:47.681
The...
With the great teeth and that hair...

27:48.760 --> 27:51.730
Anyway, nothing much comes of it.
Hoffman doesn't know anything.

27:51.920 --> 27:54.844
But what a scene.

27:55.520 --> 27:58.490
Unfortunately,
nothing quite so dramatic today.

27:58.680 --> 28:00.409
We're gonna be more businesslike.

28:00.600 --> 28:03.331
That Novocain Agent Navabi
just gave you...

28:03.520 --> 28:07.525
...should be starting to kick in
right about now. So here's our plan.

28:07.720 --> 28:12.169
You're gonna tell us
what sort of mass-casualty event...

28:12.360 --> 28:14.647
...or events the Director is planning.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.769
Either you answer our questions...

28:17.280 --> 28:19.965
...or we're gonna yank out
all your teeth today.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.844
I told you.

28:22.040 --> 28:23.963
I don't know.

28:24.320 --> 28:28.041
The Director never spoke of his plans
with me.

28:28.240 --> 28:31.130
I'm not in the loop
on operational details.

28:31.640 --> 28:33.130
I don't believe that.

28:33.320 --> 28:35.607
I offered you an opportunity...

28:35.800 --> 28:39.441
...to elevate your position
within the Cabal, Kenneth.

28:39.640 --> 28:42.962
You declined and instead
remained loyal to the Director.

28:43.200 --> 28:47.410
I assumed you had greater aspirations,
but you don't, do you, Kenneth?

28:47.600 --> 28:50.126
You rejected my offer
because as it turns out...

28:50.440 --> 28:53.444
...you're quite satisfied
with your station.

28:53.760 --> 28:57.242
That's how I know you're one
of the primary decision makers.

28:57.560 --> 29:01.121
Clearly, you are very much in the loop.

29:02.520 --> 29:05.364
You don't understand my loyalty,
do you?

29:05.560 --> 29:10.885
Because you have nothing in your life
worth staying loyal to.

29:12.720 --> 29:13.881
William Devane.

29:14.080 --> 29:15.445
It was William Devane...

29:15.640 --> 29:18.450
...with those marvelous teeth
and that great hair.

29:18.640 --> 29:21.007
Oh, I love William Devane.

29:21.560 --> 29:25.451
Anyway, that said,
dentistry makes me a little queasy...

29:25.640 --> 29:31.522
...so I'll leave you and my lovely
associate to the business at hand.

29:38.440 --> 29:39.487
Look at me.

29:46.360 --> 29:48.089
Sir, we don't have much time.

29:48.280 --> 29:50.806
We need to move quickly
before he comes back.

29:53.560 --> 29:56.564
I have orders from the Director
to get you out of here.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.924
Stay behind me and keep quiet.

30:08.720 --> 30:10.290
Stop.

30:17.720 --> 30:19.768
Get in the car. Go.

30:31.760 --> 30:35.207
I've scrambled P.D. to An Bai's house.
They should get there before you do.

30:35.400 --> 30:38.961
- Were you able to reach her?
- No answer on cell. I'll try her home line.

30:39.160 --> 30:42.687
For Satan himself is transformed
into an angel of light.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.166
Corinthians.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.370
- Where are we going?
- I have orders to take you to the Director.

30:48.120 --> 30:51.886
I was aware we had someone
on the inside, but I just didn't know who.

30:52.120 --> 30:55.966
Well, I'm not on the inside anymore.
I just blew my cover to save you.

30:56.200 --> 31:00.000
It took me nine months to get Reddington
and that damn task force to trust me.

31:00.200 --> 31:03.204
Look, the Director
won't take any chances.

31:03.400 --> 31:07.200
If he thinks I've divulged any information
in their plans, I am done.

31:07.640 --> 31:10.723
I need you to make it clear
that I didn't break.

31:10.920 --> 31:14.003
I don't know what you said
before Reddington brought me in.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.282
Nothing.
That's why Reddington brought you in.

31:16.520 --> 31:18.761
He knows the Director
is advancing the time line.

31:18.960 --> 31:22.931
Plan is to trigger a series of events that
will bring us to the brink of another war.

31:23.120 --> 31:26.090
- I didn't tell him. Leonard Caul.
- Reddington has the Fulcrum.

31:26.320 --> 31:28.846
He has a blueprint
outlining our entire infrastructure.

31:29.040 --> 31:31.247
If you leaked operational details,
we're done.

31:31.440 --> 31:32.566
I didn't.

31:32.760 --> 31:35.843
I don't even have those details.

31:36.080 --> 31:40.563
I know we are targeting a defense
installation, but I don't know which one.

31:40.760 --> 31:42.250
I'm serious.

31:44.640 --> 31:48.326
The Director won't finalize his choice
until next week.

31:48.760 --> 31:51.525
Then you have nothing to worry about.

31:52.800 --> 31:56.043
Why are we...?
Where are you taking me? This isn't...

31:56.240 --> 31:59.847
In Corinthians, Satan wasn't transformed
into an angel of light.

32:00.040 --> 32:01.849
He was disguised as one.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.283
Don't look so glum, Kenneth.

32:17.480 --> 32:21.485
You just spent 10 minutes
being ridden hard by Agent Navabi.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.170
I'd die for five.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.686
- Hello?
- Miss Bai?

32:33.880 --> 32:37.407
My name is Aram Mojtabai,
and I am an agent with the FBI.

32:37.640 --> 32:39.768
We have reason to believe
you're in danger.

32:39.960 --> 32:41.928
- What are you talking about?
- I'll explain.

32:42.120 --> 32:44.361
I need you to find a secure room
in your house.

32:44.600 --> 32:46.807
Make sure all the doors and windows
are locked.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.721
The police are on their way, and I'm
gonna stay on the line until they arrive.

33:02.880 --> 33:04.041
Miss Bai.

33:04.840 --> 33:06.410
Hello?

33:06.960 --> 33:09.122
Miss Bai, hello?
Hello, are you still there?

33:10.400 --> 33:11.606
Miss Bai?

33:21.800 --> 33:24.963
Fifty-three to Dispatch.
We're here at the location.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.686
Doesn't seem to be anyone home.

33:34.280 --> 33:35.725
Hang on.

33:40.760 --> 33:41.921
Hands! Show me hands.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.603
Step out of the car.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.764
That's Charlie 14.

33:49.240 --> 33:51.561
Cancel that, F15.

33:59.720 --> 34:02.291
You don't have any idea
what you've done, do you?

34:02.480 --> 34:05.086
You're the one charged
with a dozen felonies, Mr. Zhang.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.567
You're the one
who almost took a woman's life.

34:07.760 --> 34:10.047
And how many lives did you take?

34:10.239 --> 34:14.563
This tradition in Chinese culture
that you think is just some ghost story...

34:14.760 --> 34:17.047
...with no basis in the real world.

34:17.280 --> 34:21.444
But this, this is the real world.

34:21.639 --> 34:23.244
You were in a fire?

34:24.760 --> 34:27.764
My older brother died
when he was only 27.

34:28.000 --> 34:29.684
I'm sorry.

34:30.239 --> 34:34.802
My brother, he was unmarried.

34:35.320 --> 34:40.770
And in the years to follow,
he haunted my family from the grave.

34:41.159 --> 34:45.210
My father worked for the same factory
for 32 years.

34:45.920 --> 34:49.686
They closed down four months
after my brother's death.

34:50.120 --> 34:52.248
And the bad luck that followed was...

34:53.320 --> 34:56.802
Our home was destroyed
by a catastrophic fire.

34:57.000 --> 34:58.968
My mother and father did not survive.

34:59.720 --> 35:04.362
I sat with my mother in the hospital
the day she passed.

35:05.280 --> 35:08.011
Saw the fear in her eyes.

35:09.120 --> 35:13.444
She said,
"You know why this happened.

35:14.120 --> 35:17.602
It will never stop
until you appease your brother."

35:18.840 --> 35:20.922
So that night...

35:21.160 --> 35:24.323
...I stole the body of a young woman
from our village...

35:24.520 --> 35:27.967
...and buried her alongside my brother.

35:29.680 --> 35:34.891
A wife for him,
a husband for her in the next life.

35:38.840 --> 35:42.890
And from that day on,
the bad luck was gone.

35:43.440 --> 35:49.243
Just like my brother haunted me,
Jin Han haunts his parents now.

35:49.440 --> 35:52.171
Because of you, he's not appeased.

35:52.760 --> 35:54.569
And now he will bring bad luck...

35:54.760 --> 35:57.570
...to those who have denied
his happiness in the next life.

35:57.800 --> 36:00.724
That includes you
and your fellow agents.

36:00.920 --> 36:04.367
We know you don't work exclusively
as an independent operator.

36:04.800 --> 36:08.725
Your skill as an international smuggler
has made you quite valuable.

36:09.080 --> 36:10.411
Valuable? To who?

36:10.640 --> 36:13.450
To an organization
some call the Cabal.

36:13.840 --> 36:16.491
- I don't know what that is.
- You may not know the name...

36:16.680 --> 36:19.160
...you know who hired you
to procure the weapon used...

36:19.400 --> 36:22.051
...in the Taiwanese festival bombing.

36:22.960 --> 36:25.930
Or the convoy hit in Jakarta.

36:26.520 --> 36:27.726
I'm listening.

36:27.920 --> 36:31.049
There's going to be an attack
on U.S. soil next week.

36:31.240 --> 36:33.811
You were contracted to bring an item
into the country...

36:34.040 --> 36:36.771
...something we believe
will be instrumental in that attack.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.731
We need to know what it is
and when it's coming.

36:39.960 --> 36:41.644
- Heh. You're wrong.
- We're not wrong.

36:41.880 --> 36:43.166
We know you were contracted.

36:43.360 --> 36:44.486
Not about that.

36:44.720 --> 36:47.644
I was called to arrange a delivery.

36:48.000 --> 36:50.128
But not for an item.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.369
It was an agent.

36:52.600 --> 36:54.682
The one they call Karakurt.

36:55.000 --> 36:57.287
Karakurt? Who is that?

36:57.520 --> 37:00.842
And he's not arriving next week.

37:01.640 --> 37:02.880
He's already here.

37:03.600 --> 37:09.243
You see, Agent Keen,
your bad luck is already beginning.

37:17.320 --> 37:19.209
I need a minute.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.445
I'm out.

37:24.640 --> 37:27.644
I'm not leaking classified data.
Not for you, not for anybody.

37:27.840 --> 37:28.966
You're out? Out of what?

37:29.160 --> 37:31.891
Whatever the hell kind of game it is
you and I are playing.

37:32.080 --> 37:35.004
You know I'm ill.
I came to you for help, as a friend.

37:35.200 --> 37:37.123
I thought that you offered as a friend.

37:37.320 --> 37:39.288
- I did.
- Enough games, Tom.

37:39.520 --> 37:42.922
You used it to leverage me,
to hold it over my head...

37:43.120 --> 37:46.124
...as a way to guarantee my assistance
whenever you need it.

37:46.360 --> 37:50.285
You think I pulled strings trying to save
your life for my own personal benefit?

37:51.440 --> 37:54.250
Look me in the eye
and tell me I'm wrong.

37:55.120 --> 37:57.487
Oh, I'll do better than that, Harold.

37:57.680 --> 38:01.651
I'll look you in the eye and tell you
you're not even close.

38:02.280 --> 38:07.730
The situation is much, much worse
than you think.

38:08.480 --> 38:12.610
You're absolutely right. I helped you to
get close, to get leverage, but not for me.

38:12.800 --> 38:15.406
Buddy, come on.
We're done with the games.

38:15.640 --> 38:20.123
I'm sure a smart guy like you
can guess who's calling my plays.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.047
The Cabal.

38:23.600 --> 38:26.843
A quaint term that no one
actually involved would ever use.

38:27.440 --> 38:28.646
Why me?

38:28.840 --> 38:34.051
If you guys are as powerful as I'm told,
what the hell do you need me for?

38:34.240 --> 38:35.526
All in good time, Harold.

38:36.000 --> 38:38.765
What matters now
is that you realize one key thing...

38:39.000 --> 38:43.210
...that you understand it and internalize
it with every fiber of your being.

38:43.400 --> 38:45.129
- And that is?
- We own you.

38:45.680 --> 38:48.524
You perjured yourself
to protect Agent Keen.

38:48.760 --> 38:52.970
You broke federal law by disclosing
the time line of a pending indictment.

38:53.160 --> 38:56.926
If that weren't enough, a classified
document was leaked today to The Post.

38:57.120 --> 39:01.125
- I told you, I won't do it.
- You're not understanding me, Harold.

39:01.320 --> 39:03.641
It's already done.

39:04.400 --> 39:07.847
It seems your wife doesn't share
your ethical principles.

39:08.560 --> 39:12.929
You wouldn't do it, so Charlene
made the hard decision for you.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.522
That's how much she loves you.

39:16.720 --> 39:20.202
God knows my wife wouldn't commit
any felonies for my behalf.

39:21.000 --> 39:24.049
I'm sure you're thinking up
all of the moves you have left.

39:24.240 --> 39:25.321
Careful.

39:25.680 --> 39:32.211
The people I speak for won't hesitate
to hurt you or her if they need to.

39:32.400 --> 39:33.845
So, what now?

39:34.040 --> 39:37.089
Like I said, all will soon be revealed.

39:37.280 --> 39:41.080
Come on.
I think they're almost ready to start.

39:48.360 --> 39:49.646
A package arrived for you.

39:50.040 --> 39:53.567
It was flagged by security, and I think
you need to see it for yourself.

40:02.920 --> 40:05.241
I had a little chat with Jasper today.

40:05.440 --> 40:07.966
Turns out he wasn't very good
at holding his tongue...

40:08.160 --> 40:10.322
