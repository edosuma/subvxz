WEBVTT

00:04.463 --> 00:06.010
Out of my way!

00:09.134 --> 00:10.477
Doctor!

00:11.261 --> 00:12.433
Doctor!

00:13.931 --> 00:15.228
Doctor!

00:16.725 --> 00:18.102
Doctor!

00:20.521 --> 00:22.239
Where's the Doctor?

00:23.857 --> 00:24.983
Doctor who?

00:41.375 --> 00:44.254
You know, this isn't nearly
as bad as it looks.

00:46.630 --> 00:47.973
"At the personal intervention
of the King,

00:48.048 --> 00:49.675
"the unnamed Doctor was incarcerated

00:49.758 --> 00:51.305
"without trial in the Tower of London."

00:51.385 --> 00:52.932
Okay, but it doesn't have to be him.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.890
"According to contemporary accounts,
two nights later, a magical sphere,

00:55.973 --> 00:58.852
"some 20 feet across,
was seen floating away from the Tower,

00:58.934 --> 01:02.484
- "bearing the mysterious Doctor aloft."
- Okay, it's him.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.730
There is more.

01:03.814 --> 01:05.987
Doctor. Doctor, what can you see?

01:06.316 --> 01:08.865
Is the commandant's office
painted a sort of green color

01:08.944 --> 01:09.991
with a big flag on the wall?

01:11.488 --> 01:13.115
I think the answer is probably "yes".

01:13.240 --> 01:14.662
- Get him up!
- Ow!

01:15.784 --> 01:17.707
It's like he's being
deliberately ridiculous,

01:17.786 --> 01:18.912
trying to attract our attention.

01:18.996 --> 01:20.088
Are you watching this again?

01:20.163 --> 01:22.916
Yeah, I've explained the jokes.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.094
So what are you saying?
Do you really think he's back there

01:25.168 --> 01:27.170
trying to wave to us
out of history books?

01:27.254 --> 01:29.723
Hey, it's the sort of thing he'd do.
Thanks.

01:29.798 --> 01:31.050
Yeah, but why?

01:31.133 --> 01:32.601
Well, he said he'd be in touch.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.894
- Two months ago.
- Two months is nothing.

01:34.970 --> 01:36.847
He's up to something.
I know he is. I know him.

01:39.474 --> 01:40.475
What is it?

01:40.809 --> 01:41.810
Amy?

01:41.893 --> 01:44.021
A date, a time, a map reference.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.606
I think it's an invitation.

01:45.689 --> 01:47.362
- From who?
- It's not signed.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.659
Look, Tardis blue.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.222
You'd better get down here, sir.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.308
She's doing it again.

02:17.763 --> 02:19.390
Dr Song, sir.

02:19.514 --> 02:21.061
She's packing.

02:22.017 --> 02:24.566
Says she's going to
some planet called America.

02:35.739 --> 02:37.616
- Thanks!
- You're very welcome!

02:38.700 --> 02:40.327
This is it, yeah? The right place?

02:40.577 --> 02:43.080
Uh, nowhere, middle of?

02:43.163 --> 02:44.585
Yeah, this it.

02:45.290 --> 02:46.462
Howdy.

02:47.042 --> 02:48.168
Doctor!

02:48.251 --> 02:49.924
It's the Pond!

02:50.337 --> 02:53.011
- Hey!
- Come on, Pond. Hello, Pond! Come here!

02:53.131 --> 02:55.259
So someone's been a busy boy, then, eh?

02:55.300 --> 02:56.677
- Did you see me?
- Of course.

02:56.760 --> 02:57.807
- Stalker.
- Flirt.

02:57.928 --> 03:00.807
- Husband.
- Row the Roman! Oh, come here!

03:01.306 --> 03:02.979
Ooh, ah.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.525
Hey, nice hat.

03:04.601 --> 03:06.695
I wear a Stetson now. Stetsons are cool.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.077
Hello, sweetie.

03:15.112 --> 03:16.989
Right, then, where are we?

03:17.072 --> 03:19.370
- Have we done Easter Island yet?
- Um...

03:19.449 --> 03:20.917
Yes! I've got Easter Island.

03:21.076 --> 03:22.828
They worshipped you there.

03:23.203 --> 03:24.625
Have you seen the statues?

03:24.913 --> 03:25.914
Jim the Fish.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.465
Oh! Jim the Fish.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.009
How is he?

03:29.334 --> 03:30.881
Still building his dam.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.426
Sorry, what are you two doing?

03:33.505 --> 03:35.849
They're both time travellers,
so they never meet in the right order.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.392
They're syncing their diaries.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.969
So what's happening, then?

03:39.511 --> 03:41.263
Because you've been up to something.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.148
I've been running,

03:44.850 --> 03:46.102
faster than I've ever run,

03:46.935 --> 03:49.029
and I've been running my whole life.

03:49.813 --> 03:51.406
Now it's time for me to stop.

03:52.858 --> 03:55.281
And tonight, I'm going to
need you all with me.

03:56.820 --> 03:57.912
Okay.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.577
We're here. What's up?

03:59.823 --> 04:00.915
A picnic.

04:00.991 --> 04:02.117
And then a trip.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.420
Somewhere different,
somewhere brand new.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.168
Where?

04:08.165 --> 04:09.417
Space.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.177
1969.

04:51.500 --> 04:52.501
Salad!

04:52.542 --> 04:53.794
Salad!

04:53.877 --> 04:56.505
So when are we going to 1969?

04:57.130 --> 04:58.757
And since when do you drink wine?

04:58.840 --> 05:00.683
I'm 1103. I must've drunk it sometime.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.555
Oh, why, it's horrid!

05:05.806 --> 05:07.023
I thought it would taste
more like the gums.

05:07.098 --> 05:10.068
1103? You were 908
the last time we saw you.

05:10.101 --> 05:12.945
And you've put on a couple of pounds.
I wasn't going to mention it.

05:20.779 --> 05:21.871
Who's that?

05:21.947 --> 05:23.244
Hmm? Who's who?

05:24.741 --> 05:25.993
Sorry, what?

05:26.117 --> 05:28.290
What did you see?
You said you saw something.

05:28.411 --> 05:29.412
No, I didn't.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.713
Ah! The moon.

05:31.206 --> 05:32.298
Look at it.

05:32.374 --> 05:34.172
Of course, you lot did a lot
more than look, didn't you?

05:34.251 --> 05:36.470
A big silvery thing in the sky.

05:36.545 --> 05:37.922
You couldn't resist it.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.381
Quite right.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.799
The moon landing was in '69.

05:41.716 --> 05:42.717
Is that where we're going?

05:42.801 --> 05:45.554
Oh, well, a lot more happens in '69
than anyone remembers.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.223
Human beings.

05:49.140 --> 05:50.892
I thought I'd never get done saving you.

06:09.452 --> 06:10.453
Who's he?

06:11.413 --> 06:12.414
Oh, my God!

06:16.960 --> 06:18.553
You all need to stay back.

06:20.046 --> 06:22.469
Whatever happens now,
you do not interfere.

06:24.509 --> 06:25.635
Clear?

06:32.058 --> 06:33.810
That's an astronaut.

06:34.102 --> 06:35.979
That's an Apollo astronaut in the lake.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.147
Look.

06:43.778 --> 06:45.030
Hello.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.619
It's okay. I know it's you.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.581
Well, then.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.052
What's he doing?

07:07.427 --> 07:09.395
Doctor!

07:09.512 --> 07:10.934
Amy, stay back!

07:11.139 --> 07:12.766
The Doctor said stay back!

07:13.350 --> 07:15.352
- We have to stay back!
- No! No!

07:20.273 --> 07:21.490
Doctor!

07:28.573 --> 07:30.041
I'm sorry.

07:45.340 --> 07:48.469
- No! Doctor!
- Doctor, please!

07:53.682 --> 07:55.400
River. River!

08:00.230 --> 08:02.858
No. No.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.164
Of course not.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.174
River, he can't be dead.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.343
This isn't possible.

08:26.464 --> 08:29.934
Whatever that was, it killed him
in the middle of his regeneration cycle.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.890
His body was already dead.

08:33.179 --> 08:35.273
He didn't make it to the next one.

08:35.765 --> 08:39.395
But maybe he's a clone
or a duplicate or something.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.400
I believe I can save you some time.

08:44.566 --> 08:46.409
That most certainly is the Doctor.

08:48.111 --> 08:50.364
And he is most certainly dead.

08:50.905 --> 08:52.703
He said you'd need this.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.207
Gasoline?

09:04.753 --> 09:06.596
A Time Lord's body is a miracle,

09:07.380 --> 09:08.757
even a dead one.

09:09.591 --> 09:10.763
There are whole empires out there

09:10.842 --> 09:12.844
who'd rip this world apart
for just one cell.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.184
We can't leave him here.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.308
Or anywhere.

09:18.600 --> 09:19.601
Wake up.

09:19.684 --> 09:22.403
Go on, wake up!
You stupid, bloody idiot.

09:26.441 --> 09:28.193
What do we do, Rory?

09:29.861 --> 09:31.158
We're his friends.

09:33.364 --> 09:35.287
We do what the Doctor's
friends always do.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.416
As we're told.

09:41.372 --> 09:42.919
There's a boat.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.177
If we're going to do this,

09:49.130 --> 09:50.052
let's do it properly.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.929
Who are you?

10:31.131 --> 10:32.804
Why did you come?

10:33.133 --> 10:34.885
The same reason as you.

10:45.812 --> 10:47.029
Dr Song,

10:48.690 --> 10:49.782
Amy,

10:50.567 --> 10:51.739
Rory.

10:52.235 --> 10:55.034
I'm Canton Everett Delaware III.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.788
I won't be seeing you again,

10:59.576 --> 11:02.170
but you'll be seeing me.

11:14.090 --> 11:15.216
Four.

11:16.593 --> 11:17.594
Sorry, what?

11:17.677 --> 11:20.021
The Doctor numbered the envelopes.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.815
You got 3, I was 2, Mr Delaware was 4.

11:22.891 --> 11:24.017
So?

11:24.100 --> 11:25.647
So where's 1?

11:26.227 --> 11:28.025
What, you think he invited someone else?

11:28.062 --> 11:29.234
Well, he must have.

11:29.314 --> 11:31.362
He planned all of this,
to the last detail.

11:31.441 --> 11:32.909
Will you two shut up? It doesn't matter.

11:32.984 --> 11:34.361
- He was up to something.
- He's dead.

11:34.444 --> 11:36.788
"Space 1969." What did he mean?

11:36.988 --> 11:38.831
You're still talking,
but it doesn't matter.

11:38.907 --> 11:42.081
- Hey, it mattered to him.
- So it matters to us.

11:42.160 --> 11:45.164
- He's dead.
- But he still needs us.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.541
I know.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.176
Amy, I know.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.549
But right now, we have to focus.

11:56.132 --> 11:57.258
Look.

11:59.677 --> 12:01.429
Excuse me, who was sitting over there?

12:01.512 --> 12:02.809
Some guy.

12:02.889 --> 12:04.766
The Doctor knew
he was going to his death,

12:04.849 --> 12:06.226
so he sent out messages.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.854
When you know it's the end,
who do you call?

12:09.187 --> 12:10.484
Uh, your friends, people you trust.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.860
Number 1.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.359
Who did the Doctor trust the most?

12:20.907 --> 12:22.375
This is cold.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.253
Even by your standards, this is cold.

12:25.328 --> 12:27.080
Or "hello", as people used to say.

12:27.288 --> 12:28.335
Doctor?

12:28.498 --> 12:30.546
I just popped out
to get my special straw.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.711
It adds more fizz.

12:37.548 --> 12:40.643
You're okay. How can you be okay?

12:40.718 --> 12:42.186
Hey, of course I'm okay.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.731
I'm always okay. I'm the king of okay.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.229
Oh, that's a rubbish title.
Forget that title.

12:47.308 --> 12:51.154
Row the Roman!
That's a good title. Hello, Rory.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.399
And Dr River Song.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.534
Oh, you bad, bad girl.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.407
What trouble have you got
for me this time?

12:59.862 --> 13:00.988
Okay.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.742
I'm assuming that's for
something I haven't done yet.

13:05.868 --> 13:06.994
Yes, it is.

13:07.078 --> 13:08.250
Good. Looking forward to that.

13:08.329 --> 13:09.706
I don't understand.

13:11.291 --> 13:12.508
How can you be here?

13:13.293 --> 13:14.761
I was invited.

13:15.461 --> 13:17.589
Date, map reference.

13:17.672 --> 13:20.016
Same as you lot, I assume. Otherwise,
it's a hell of a coincidence.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.092
River, what's going on?

13:21.175 --> 13:22.677
Amy, ask him what age he is.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.103
- That's a bit personal.
- Tell her.

13:24.178 --> 13:26.226
- Tell her what age you are.
- 909.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.025
- Yeah, but you said you were...
- So where does that leave us, huh?

13:29.600 --> 13:30.692
Jim the Fish?

13:30.810 --> 13:32.187
Have we done Jim the Fish yet?

13:32.312 --> 13:34.030
Who's Jim the Fish?

13:34.856 --> 13:36.233
I don't understand.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.483
Yeah, you do.

13:37.567 --> 13:39.786
I don't! What are we all doing here?

13:44.532 --> 13:46.079
We've been recruited.

13:46.701 --> 13:50.626
Something to do with space, 1969,

13:50.955 --> 13:55.677
and a man called
Canton Everett Delaware III.

13:56.711 --> 13:58.179
Recruited by who?

13:59.630 --> 14:03.009
Someone who trusts you
more than anybody else in the universe.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.016
And who's that?

14:06.971 --> 14:08.223
Spoilers.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.401
1969, that's an easy one!

14:12.560 --> 14:14.233
Funny how some years are easy.

14:14.312 --> 14:16.189
Now, 1482, full of glitches.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.651
Now, then, Canton Everett Delaware III.
That was his name, yeah?

14:19.734 --> 14:22.658
How many of those can there be?
Well, three, I suppose.

14:27.617 --> 14:30.587
ROW, is everybody cross with me
for some reason?

14:31.412 --> 14:33.005
I'll find out.

14:42.173 --> 14:43.265
Explain it again?

14:43.341 --> 14:45.685
The Doctor we saw on the beach
is a future version,

14:46.052 --> 14:47.975
200 years older than the one up there.

14:48.054 --> 14:50.273
But all that's still going to happen,
he's still going to die?

14:50.598 --> 14:52.020
We're all going to do that, Amy.

14:52.100 --> 14:55.400
We're not all going to arrange
our own wake and invite ourselves.

14:56.938 --> 15:00.659
So, the Doctor, in the future,
knowing he's going to die,

15:00.733 --> 15:05.830
recruits his younger self
and all of us to...to what, exactly?

15:06.531 --> 15:07.578
Avenge him?

15:07.657 --> 15:10.251
- Mmm-mmm. Avenging's not his style.
- Save him.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.999
Yeah, that's not really
his style, either.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.292
Well, we have to tell him.

15:13.371 --> 15:14.839
We've told him all we can.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.175
We can't even tell him
we've seen his future self.

15:19.877 --> 15:21.720
He's interacted with his own past.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.385
It could rip a hole in the universe.

15:23.464 --> 15:24.841
Except he's done it before.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.268
And, in fairness,
the universe did blow up.

15:27.301 --> 15:31.022
- But he'd want to know!
- Would he? Would anyone?

15:31.097 --> 15:32.895
I'm being extremely clever up here

15:32.974 --> 15:34.897
and there's no one to stand around
looking impressed!

15:34.976 --> 15:36.774
What's the point in having you all?

15:37.603 --> 15:39.355
Couldn't you just slap him sometimes?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.407
River, we can't just let him die.

15:41.899 --> 15:43.276
We have to stop it.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.077
How can you be okay with this?

15:45.153 --> 15:48.578
The Doctor's death doesn't frighten me,
nor does my own.

15:49.407 --> 15:51.455
There's a far worse day coming for me.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.626
Time isn't a straight line.

15:56.706 --> 15:59.459
It's all bumpy-wumpy.
There's loads of boring stuff,

15:59.500 --> 16:02.344
like Sundays and Tuesdays
and Thursday afternoons.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.385
But now and then, there are Saturdays,

16:04.422 --> 16:06.595
big, temporal tipping points
when anything's possible.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.018
The Tardis can't resist them,
like a moth to a flame.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.687
She loves a party,
so I gave her 1969 and NASA,

16:11.762 --> 16:15.141
because that's space in the '60s,
and Canton Everett Delaware III,

16:15.183 --> 16:18.027
and this is where she's pointing.

16:18.060 --> 16:21.940
Washington, DC. April the 8th, 1969.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.233
So why haven't we landed?

16:23.316 --> 16:25.193
- Because that's not where we're going.
- Oh.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.911
- Where are we going?
- Home! Well, you two are.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.535
Off you pop and make babies.
And you, Dr Song, back to prison.

16:29.614 --> 16:32.493
And me?
I'm late for a biplane lesson in 1911.

16:32.575 --> 16:35.499
Or it could be knitting.
Knitting or biplanes, one or the other.

16:43.169 --> 16:44.295
What?

16:45.087 --> 16:47.636
A mysterious summons.
You think I'm just going to go?

16:49.342 --> 16:50.969
Who sent those messages?

16:53.971 --> 16:56.019
I know you know,
I can see it in your faces.

16:56.098 --> 16:57.145
Don't play games with me.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.730
Don't ever, ever think
you're capable of that.

16:58.809 --> 17:00.277
You're going to have to trust us
this time.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.071
Trust you? Sure.

17:02.980 --> 17:05.449
But first of all, Dr Song,
just one thing.

17:07.068 --> 17:08.490
Who are you?

17:10.404 --> 17:12.748
You're someone from my future,
getting that, but who?

17:18.996 --> 17:20.122
Okay.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.633
Why are you in prison?
Who did you kill?

17:23.501 --> 17:24.593
Hmm?

17:25.127 --> 17:26.628
Now, I love a bad girl, me,

17:27.922 --> 17:29.424
but trust you?

17:31.175 --> 17:32.472
Seriously?

17:33.886 --> 17:35.263
Trust me.

17:37.848 --> 17:38.974
Okay.

17:43.187 --> 17:46.236
You have to do this
and you can't ask why.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.993
Are you being threatened?
Is someone making you say that?

17:49.068 --> 17:50.069
No.

17:51.153 --> 17:52.780
- You're lying.
- I'm not lying.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.460
Swear to me.
Swear to me, on something that matters.

18:06.502 --> 18:07.970
Fish fingers and custard.

18:17.597 --> 18:18.849
My life in your hands,

18:20.725 --> 18:22.102
Amelia Pond.

18:29.650 --> 18:31.027
Thank you.

18:31.360 --> 18:34.580
So! Canton Everett Delaware III.

18:34.864 --> 18:35.865
Who's Cs' he?

18:35.948 --> 18:38.076
- Who wants to know?
- Your boss.

18:38.159 --> 18:39.411
I don't have a boss any more.

18:39.493 --> 18:42.713
Maybe you want to tell that
to the President of the United States.

18:44.290 --> 18:46.258
- Ex-FBI. Got kicked out.
- Why?

18:46.709 --> 18:49.053
I understand
you have a problem with authority

18:49.128 --> 18:51.847
- Thank you.
- That's not a compliment son.

18:51.922 --> 18:54.300
Six weeks after he left the Bureau,

18:54.383 --> 18:56.806
the President contacted him
for a private meeting.

18:56.886 --> 18:58.684
Yeah, 1969. Who's President?

18:58.929 --> 19:00.806
This is a personal matter.

19:01.265 --> 19:03.188
I need someone on the outside,

19:03.351 --> 19:04.978
someone with FBI training,

19:05.102 --> 19:06.695
but who's not in contact with them.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.023
I'm flattered.

19:08.230 --> 19:10.699
You were my second choice
for this, Mr Delaware.

19:10.775 --> 19:12.197
That's okay

19:12.360 --> 19:14.863
You were my second choice
for President, Mr Nixon.

19:22.662 --> 19:24.380
Richard Milhous Nixon.

19:24.455 --> 19:25.923
Vietnam, Watergate.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.296
- There's some good stuff, too.
- Not enough.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.302
- Hippie!
- Archaeologist.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.431
Every day, wherever I am,

19:34.757 --> 19:36.054
I get a phone call.

19:36.133 --> 19:37.760
People can't just call you,
Mr President.

19:39.220 --> 19:40.938
It's a direct call every time.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.103
Every day for the last two weeks,

19:44.100 --> 19:45.272
usually late at night.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.819
Man or woman?

19:47.603 --> 19:48.650
Neither.

19:52.608 --> 19:53.860
Listen.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.869
Okay, since I don't know
what I'm getting into this time,

19:55.945 --> 19:58.573
for once, I'm being discreet,
putting the engines on silent.

20:02.827 --> 20:03.874
Did you do something?

20:03.953 --> 20:06.001
No, just watching.

20:07.081 --> 20:09.379
Putting the outer shell on "invisible".
Haven't done this in a while.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.960
Big drain on the power.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.717
- You can turn the Tardis invisible?
- Ha!

20:14.964 --> 20:16.432
Very nearly.

20:16.841 --> 20:18.718
Uh, did you touch something?

20:18.801 --> 20:20.724
Just admiring your skills, sweetie.

20:20.803 --> 20:23.181
Good. You might learn something.

20:23.264 --> 20:24.390
Okay.

20:27.059 --> 20:30.404
Now, I can't check the scanner, it
doesn't work when we're cloaked. Um...

20:31.355 --> 20:32.982
just give us a mo'.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.237
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:34.316 --> 20:35.818
You lot, wait a moment.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.329
We're in the middle
of the most powerful city

20:38.404 --> 20:40.827
in the most powerful country on Earth.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.669
Let's take it slow.

20:53.836 --> 20:55.383
Hello?

20:56.213 --> 20:57.635
Who is this?

20:57.965 --> 21:00.218
This is President Nixon. Who is calling?

21:01.093 --> 21:02.811
Is this you again?

21:02.928 --> 21:04.930
- Mr President?
- A child.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.479
This is the President yes.

21:07.558 --> 21:09.185
I'm scared Mr President

21:10.060 --> 21:11.687
I'm scared of the spaceman.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.398
- A little girl?
- Boy.

21:13.481 --> 21:15.074
How can you be sure?

21:15.649 --> 21:17.151
What spaceman?

21:18.235 --> 21:19.737
Where are you phoning from?

21:19.820 --> 21:21.288
Where are you right now?

21:22.573 --> 21:23.916
Who are you?

21:23.991 --> 21:26.790
Jefferson Adams Hamilton.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.084
Jefferson, listen to me.

21:31.624 --> 21:35.003
Surely this is something
the Bureau could handle, sir.

21:35.085 --> 21:36.758
These calls happen wherever I am.

21:37.755 --> 21:39.723
How do I know the Bureau isn't involved?

21:40.090 --> 21:41.933
I can't trust anyone...

21:53.562 --> 21:54.609
Oh!

21:54.897 --> 21:56.023
Hello.

21:56.565 --> 21:57.987
Bad moment.

21:58.776 --> 22:01.620
Oh, look, this is the Oval Office.

22:01.695 --> 22:05.620
I was looking for the, er, Oblong Room.

22:05.699 --> 22:07.997
I’ll just be off, then,

22:08.536 --> 22:09.583
shall I?

22:13.541 --> 22:14.963
Every time.

22:15.042 --> 22:16.134
Don't worry!

22:16.210 --> 22:17.462
It always does that when its cloaked.

22:17.837 --> 22:19.134
No! Stop that.

22:19.213 --> 22:21.090
- He said the scanner wouldn't work.
- I know.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.259
Bless.

22:23.300 --> 22:26.179
- Ow, ow...
- Lockdown! Lockdown!

22:26.887 --> 22:28.389
Stop that! Ow!

22:28.472 --> 22:30.770
River, have you got
my scanner working yet?

22:30.850 --> 22:32.067
Oh, I hate him.

22:32.309 --> 22:34.357
- No, you don't!
- Get the President out of here!

22:34.436 --> 22:36.234
Sir, you have to go with them now!

22:36.313 --> 22:38.486
River, make her blue again!

22:49.201 --> 22:51.044
What the hell is that?

22:54.039 --> 22:56.838
Mr President, that child just told you

22:56.917 --> 22:58.419
everything you need to know,
but you weren't listening.

22:58.460 --> 23:00.303
Never mind, though,
because the answer's yes.

23:00.462 --> 23:01.839
I'll take the case.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.219
Fellas, the guns, really?

23:03.299 --> 23:06.223
I just walked into the highest security
office in the United States,

23:06.260 --> 23:08.558
parked a big, blue box on the rug.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.814
Do you think you can just shoot me?

23:10.890 --> 23:11.982
They're Americans!

23:12.057 --> 23:13.104
Don't shoot. Definitely no shooting.

23:13.183 --> 23:16.938
No need to shoot us, either.
Very much not in need of getting shot.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.318
Look, we've got our hands up.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.617
- Who the hell are you?
- Sir, you need to stay back.

23:21.817 --> 23:24.536
But who are they and what is that box?

23:25.446 --> 23:27.323
It's a police box. Can't you read?

23:27.865 --> 23:30.584
I'm your new undercover agent,
on loan from Scotland Yard.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.081
The Doctor.

23:32.161 --> 23:34.835
The Legs, The Nose

23:34.914 --> 23:36.541
and Mrs Robinson.

23:36.624 --> 23:37.876
- I hate you.
- No, you don't.

23:37.958 --> 23:40.052
- Who are you?
- Nah, a boring question.

23:40.127 --> 23:41.970
"Who's phoning you?" That's interesting.

23:42.046 --> 23:44.390
Because Canton III is right,
that was definitely a girl's voice,

23:44.423 --> 23:46.767
which means there's only one place
in America she can be phoning from.

23:46.842 --> 23:47.889
Where?

23:47.968 --> 23:49.595
Do not engage with the intruder,
Mr Delaware.

23:50.596 --> 23:52.064
You heard everything I heard.
It's simple enough.

23:52.139 --> 23:53.686
Give me five minutes, I'll explain.

23:53.766 --> 23:55.734
On the other hand, lay a finger on me

23:56.101 --> 23:59.275
or my friends
and you'll never, ever know.

23:59.980 --> 24:01.106
How did you get it in here?

24:01.190 --> 24:02.817
I mean, you didn't carry it in.

24:02.900 --> 24:04.447
- Clever, eh?
- Love it.

24:04.568 --> 24:06.366
Do not compliment the intruder!

24:06.445 --> 24:07.822
- Five minutes?
- Five.

24:07.905 --> 24:10.579
Mr President, that man is
a clear and present danger to...

24:10.658 --> 24:13.787
Mr President, that man walked in here

24:13.869 --> 24:15.621
with a big, blue box
and three of his friends

24:16.163 --> 24:17.380
and that's the man he walked past.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.208
One of them's worth listening to.

24:19.708 --> 24:22.131
I say we give him five minutes,
see if he delivers.

24:22.503 --> 24:23.550
Thanks, Canton.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.381
If he doesn't, I'll shoot him myself.

24:25.506 --> 24:26.553
Not so thanks.

24:26.632 --> 24:28.760
- Sir, I cannot recommend...
- Shut up, Mr Peterson!

24:33.055 --> 24:34.352
All right.

24:35.683 --> 24:37.105
Five minutes.

24:44.108 --> 24:45.781
I'm going to need a SWAT team,
ready to mobilize,

24:45.859 --> 24:47.736
street-level maps
covering all of Florida,

24:47.820 --> 24:50.073
a pot of coffee,
12 Jammie Dodgers and a fez.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.867
Get him his maps.

24:58.372 --> 24:59.919
- Why Florida?
- That's where NASA is.

24:59.999 --> 25:02.502
She mentioned a spaceman.
NASA's where the spacemen live.

25:03.085 --> 25:06.009
Also, there's another lead
I'm following.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.509
A spaceman,
like the one we saw at the lake.

25:09.758 --> 25:10.930
Maybe.

25:11.719 --> 25:13.016
Probably.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.399
Who's that?

25:28.444 --> 25:29.491
I remember.

25:29.570 --> 25:30.571
Amy?

25:30.821 --> 25:32.164
What do you remember?

25:33.282 --> 25:34.829
I don't know. I just...

25:36.535 --> 25:37.707
Amy, what's wrong?

25:38.203 --> 25:39.295
Amy?

25:39.663 --> 25:42.007
- You all right?
- Yeah, no, I'm fine.

25:42.082 --> 25:43.925
I'm just feeling a little sick.

25:46.336 --> 25:47.883
Excuse me,
is there a toilet or something?

25:47.963 --> 25:49.931
Sorry, ma'am,
while this procedure's ongoing,

25:50.007 --> 25:51.475
you must remain within the Oval Office.

25:51.550 --> 25:54.269
Shut up and take her to the restroom.

25:55.929 --> 25:58.432
- This way, ma'am.
- Thanks.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.233
Your five minutes are up.

26:03.604 --> 26:05.231
Yeah? And where's my fez?

26:12.029 --> 26:14.157
Actually, I can usually
manage this alone.

26:31.131 --> 26:32.804
I saw you before, at the lake.

26:33.383 --> 26:34.680
And here.

26:38.138 --> 26:39.890
But then I forgot.

26:40.099 --> 26:41.726
How did I forget?

26:46.063 --> 26:47.690
What are you?

26:50.192 --> 26:52.115
Get back! Stay back from it.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.079
Oh, my God!
What is that? Is that a mask?

26:58.951 --> 27:00.203
Is that a Star Trek thing?

27:00.994 --> 27:02.337
Ben, is that you?

27:02.412 --> 27:03.959
Get back from it, now!

27:06.125 --> 27:07.377
Back from what, honey?

27:08.961 --> 27:10.133
That.

27:12.923 --> 27:15.142
Oh, my God! Look at that.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.597
Is that a Star Trek mask?

27:17.469 --> 27:19.062
Ben, that's got to be you.

27:20.722 --> 27:22.440
Hang on, did I just say all that?

27:24.143 --> 27:26.145
No, please, you've got to stay back.

27:28.856 --> 27:30.984
Back, honey? Back from what?

27:33.986 --> 27:36.409
Oh, those lights. They never fix them.

27:36.697 --> 27:37.744
Look behind you.

27:37.781 --> 27:39.374
Honey, there is nothing...

28:01.430 --> 28:04.525
You didn't have to kill her.
She couldn't even remember you.

28:04.600 --> 28:05.852
How does that work?

28:05.934 --> 28:08.858
We can only remember you
while we're seeing you, is that it?

28:12.191 --> 28:13.613
Why did you have to kill her?

28:14.484 --> 28:15.781
Joy.

28:18.614 --> 28:21.288
Her name was joy.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.832
Your name is Amelia.

28:27.289 --> 28:30.133
You will tell the Doctor.

28:30.959 --> 28:32.051
Tell him what?

28:32.127 --> 28:34.346
What he must know.

28:34.838 --> 28:38.388
And what he must never know.

28:38.467 --> 28:40.014
How do you know about that?

28:40.219 --> 28:42.313
Tell him.

28:48.602 --> 28:49.899
Are you okay?

28:51.104 --> 28:52.526
I'm fine.

28:52.606 --> 28:53.949
Much better, thanks.

28:54.608 --> 28:56.076
What's that?

28:58.028 --> 28:59.496
It's my phone.

28:59.571 --> 29:00.914
Your phone?

29:01.490 --> 29:02.958
I have to tell the Doctor.

29:04.034 --> 29:05.832
Tell him what, ma'am?

29:08.205 --> 29:10.128
Sorry, I don't know why I said that.

29:12.125 --> 29:13.718
This way, ma'am.

29:20.634 --> 29:21.851
The kid?

29:21.927 --> 29:23.554
- Should I answer it?
- Here!

29:23.637 --> 29:26.607
The only place in the United States
that call could be coming from.

29:26.974 --> 29:28.271
See? Obvious, when you think about it.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.945
- You, sir, are a genius.
- It's a hobby.

29:32.020 --> 29:33.488
Mr President, answer the phone.

29:40.445 --> 29:41.617
Hello?

29:42.489 --> 29:43.991
This is President Nixon.

29:44.074 --> 29:46.293
It's here!
The spaceman's here!

29:46.660 --> 29:49.209
It's going to get me!
It's going to eat me!

29:49.329 --> 29:50.797
There's no time for
a SWAT team, let's go.

29:50.872 --> 29:51.998
Mr President,
tell her help's on the way.

29:52.082 --> 29:53.675
Canton, on no account
follow me into this box

29:53.750 --> 29:56.970
- and close the door behind you.
- What the hell are you doing?

30:02.134 --> 30:03.886
Mr President! Please help.

30:04.344 --> 30:05.516
Please help me!

30:05.762 --> 30:07.605
Jefferson, it's all right.

30:08.265 --> 30:09.642
I'm sending my best people.

30:14.479 --> 30:16.857
Jefferson isn't a girl's
name. It's not her name, either.

30:16.940 --> 30:18.692
Jefferson, Adams, Hamilton. River?

30:18.817 --> 30:20.694
Surnames of three of
America's founding fathers.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.700
Lovely fellows. Two of them fancied me.

30:23.780 --> 30:25.828
Are you okay, coping?

30:25.991 --> 30:28.039
You see, the President
asked the child two questions,

30:28.243 --> 30:29.495
"Where are you?" and "Who are you?"

30:29.578 --> 30:30.625
She was answering "where".

30:30.704 --> 30:32.752
It's bigger on the inside.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.003
Ah, you get used to it.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.129
Now, where would you find

30:35.208 --> 30:36.926
three big historical names
in a row like that?

30:37.002 --> 30:38.219
- Where?
- Here.

30:39.421 --> 30:40.673
Come on!

30:43.467 --> 30:44.514
It's, uh...

30:44.593 --> 30:45.970
Are you taking care of this?

30:46.053 --> 30:47.851
Why is it always my turn?

30:48.513 --> 30:50.060
Because you're the newest.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.235
Where are we?

30:54.311 --> 30:56.734
About five miles
from Cape Kennedy Space Center.

30:56.813 --> 31:00.113
It's 1969, the year of the moon.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.489
Interesting, don't you think?

31:01.568 --> 31:03.070
But why would a little girl be here?

31:03.153 --> 31:04.655
I don't know. Lost me a bit.

31:04.738 --> 31:06.160
The President asked the girl
where she was

31:06.239 --> 31:08.458
and she did what any lost
little girl would do.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.452
She looked out of the window.

31:12.913 --> 31:15.757
Streets! Of course, street names.

31:15.832 --> 31:18.176
The only place in Florida,
probably all of America,

31:18.251 --> 31:20.094
with those three street names
on the same junction.

31:20.212 --> 31:22.340
And Dr Song,
you've got that face on again.

31:22.422 --> 31:23.469
What face?

31:23.548 --> 31:24.765
The "he's hot when he's clever" face.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.639
- This is my normal face.
- Yes, it is.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.686
- Oh, shut up.
- Not a chance.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.271
We've moved.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.978
How can we have moved?

31:36.061 --> 31:38.155
You haven't even got
to space travel yet?

31:38.480 --> 31:41.575
I was going to cover it
with time travel.

31:41.775 --> 31:44.278
- Time travel?
- Braveheart Canton, come on.

31:44.903 --> 31:47.031
So we're in a box
that's bigger on the inside

31:47.114 --> 31:48.957
- and it travels through time and space?
- Yeah, basically.

31:49.032 --> 31:50.625
How long have Scotland Yard had this?

31:51.993 --> 31:53.870
It's a warehouse
of some kind, disused.

31:53.995 --> 31:56.498
You realise this is
almost certainly a trap, of course?

31:56.581 --> 31:58.424
I noticed the phone, yes.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.173
- What about it?
- It was cut off.

32:00.377 --> 32:02.425
So how did the child phone from here?

32:02.462 --> 32:04.430
Okay, but why would
anyone want to trap us?

32:04.673 --> 32:07.973
Dunno. Let's see if anyone
tries to kill us and work backwards.

32:15.225 --> 32:17.193
Now, why would a little girl be here?

32:17.436 --> 32:20.690
I don't know.
Let's find her and ask her.

32:24.443 --> 32:26.537
It's non-terrestrial.
Definitely alien.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.197
Probably not even from this time zone.

32:29.823 --> 32:32.417
Which is odd, because look at this!

32:33.702 --> 32:35.500
It's earth tech, contemporary.

32:35.579 --> 32:38.423
Very contemporary, cutting-edge.
This is from the space programme!

32:38.498 --> 32:40.250
- Stolen?
- What, by aliens?

32:40.667 --> 32:41.714
Apparently.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.966
But why? I mean, if you can
make it all the way to Earth,

32:44.045 --> 32:46.218
why steal technology that
can barely make it to the moon?

32:46.465 --> 32:49.719
Maybe 'cause it's cooler!
Look how cool this stuff is!

32:49.926 --> 32:51.018
Cool aliens?

32:51.094 --> 32:52.892
Well, what would you call me?

32:52.971 --> 32:54.348
- An alien.
- Oi!

32:54.431 --> 32:56.980
I, uh... I think he's okay now.

32:57.058 --> 32:58.810
Ah! Back with us, Canton?

32:59.728 --> 33:01.696
- I like your wheels.
- That's my boy.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.483
So come on. Little girl, let's find her.

33:07.819 --> 33:09.571
- River...
- I know what you're thinking.

33:09.654 --> 33:10.871
No, you don't.

33:10.947 --> 33:13.996
You're thinking, "If we can find
the spaceman in 1969 and neutralise it,

33:14.075 --> 33:16.544
"then it won't be around
in 2011 to kill the Doctor."

33:17.287 --> 33:18.960
Okay, lucky guess.

33:19.623 --> 33:21.625
It's only because
I was thinking it, too.

33:22.209 --> 33:23.677
So let's do it.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.004
It doesn't work like that.

33:25.712 --> 33:27.840
We came here because of
what we saw in the future.

33:28.298 --> 33:31.302
If we try and prevent the future
from happening, we create a paradox.

33:31.468 --> 33:33.186
Time can be rewritten.

33:33.261 --> 33:34.934
- Not all of it.
- Says who?

33:35.013 --> 33:36.640
Who do you think?

33:36.765 --> 33:38.187
What's this?

33:38.433 --> 33:42.188
- We can still save him...
- Doctor, look at this.

33:46.983 --> 33:48.530
So where does that go?

33:50.403 --> 33:52.622
There's a network of
tunnels running under here.

33:52.781 --> 33:55.705
- Life signs?
- No, nothing that's showing up.

33:55.742 --> 33:57.210
Those are the worst kind.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.627
Be careful!

33:58.703 --> 34:01.081
Careful? I tried that once.

34:01.540 --> 34:02.883
Ever so dull.

34:02.958 --> 34:07.179
- Shout if you get in trouble.
- Don't worry, I'm quite the screamer.

34:07.837 --> 34:09.554
Now, there's a spoiler for you.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.512
So what's going on here?

34:11.632 --> 34:13.556
Uh, nothing. She’s just a friend.

34:15.469 --> 34:17.938
I think he's talking about
the possible alien incursion.

34:19.181 --> 34:20.478
Okay.

34:52.674 --> 34:53.721
So,

34:55.969 --> 34:57.596
I was in a bar, having a drink.

34:58.179 --> 35:01.058
Tell me honestly, am I still there?

35:01.266 --> 35:02.643
Afraid not.

35:07.439 --> 35:08.782
All clear.

35:08.940 --> 35:10.283
Just tunnels.

35:10.358 --> 35:12.110
Nothing down there I can see.

35:12.736 --> 35:14.113
Uh, give me five minutes.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.742
I want to take another look around.

35:16.239 --> 35:17.741
Stupidly dangerous!

35:17.824 --> 35:20.043
Yep! I like it, too.

35:20.744 --> 35:23.372
Amy, look after him.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.502
Rory, would you mind going with her?

35:29.044 --> 35:30.216
Yeah, a bit.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.047
Then I appreciate it all the more.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.552
Hang on, River.

35:36.718 --> 35:37.765
I'm coming, too.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.026
You okay?

35:46.061 --> 35:47.483
Ah, yes, yes.

35:47.562 --> 35:48.939
I just felt a bit sick.

35:49.564 --> 35:51.362
It's the prison food, probably.

35:54.319 --> 35:57.664
Okay, this way?

35:57.739 --> 35:59.366
What do you think?

36:24.849 --> 36:26.101
I keep thinking I hear things.

36:26.267 --> 36:29.066
It's interesting. These tunnels are old.

36:29.646 --> 36:31.193
Really old.

36:31.606 --> 36:34.155
How can they be really old
and nobody notice them?

36:43.284 --> 36:44.627
It's a maintenance hatch.

36:44.828 --> 36:46.296
It's locked.

36:46.621 --> 36:48.419
Oh, why do people always lock things?

36:48.498 --> 36:49.624
What's through there?

36:49.708 --> 36:51.881
- I've no idea.
- Something bad?

36:52.043 --> 36:53.215
Almost definitely.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.380
You're going to open it, aren't you?

36:55.547 --> 36:56.969
Well, it's locked.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.467
How's a girl supposed to resist?

36:59.008 --> 37:02.103
- Is this sensible?
- God, I hope not.

37:05.098 --> 37:07.726
Yeah, you and the Doctor,
I can kind of picture it.

37:08.351 --> 37:09.978
Keep a look out.

37:13.398 --> 37:15.071
What did you mean?

37:15.817 --> 37:17.615
What you said to Amy,

37:18.194 --> 37:19.912
there's a worse day coming for you?

37:24.033 --> 37:25.660
When I first met the Doctor,

37:26.536 --> 37:28.379
a long, long time ago,

37:30.165 --> 37:31.462
he knew all about me.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.587
Think about that.

37:37.088 --> 37:39.182
Impressionable young girl and suddenly,

37:39.257 --> 37:41.931
this man just drops out of the sky.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.139
And he's clever and mad and wonderful

37:45.805 --> 37:47.728
and knows every last thing about her.

37:49.392 --> 37:51.235
Imagine what that does to a girl.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.772
I don't really have to.

37:54.898 --> 37:56.400
Trouble is it's all back-to-front.

37:57.567 --> 37:59.695
My past is his future.

38:00.779 --> 38:02.281
We're traveling in opposite directions.

38:03.823 --> 38:06.201
Every time we meet, I know him more,

38:07.243 --> 38:08.870
he knows me less.

38:11.581 --> 38:13.299
I live for the days when I see him,

38:17.378 --> 38:18.971
but I know that every time I do,

38:19.881 --> 38:21.508
he'll be one step further away.

38:24.052 --> 38:25.474
And the day is coming

38:25.595 --> 38:27.563
when I'll look into that man's eyes,

38:30.266 --> 38:31.643
my Doctor,

38:35.563 --> 38:37.691
and he won't have
the faintest idea who I am.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.872
And I think it's going to kill me.

39:13.268 --> 39:15.236
What is this place?

39:17.689 --> 39:20.533
That's an alarm.
Check if anything's coming.

39:32.453 --> 39:34.126
There's nothing out there.

39:45.967 --> 39:49.016
These tunnels, they're not just here,
they're everywhere.

39:50.513 --> 39:53.266
They're running under the surface
of the entire planet.

39:54.601 --> 39:56.228
They've been here for centuries.

40:03.192 --> 40:04.318
Rory!

40:05.987 --> 40:07.034
So,

40:07.780 --> 40:11.034
you were kicked out of the FBI
because you had attitude problems?

40:11.618 --> 40:14.087
No, I just wanted to get married.

40:14.787 --> 40:17.540
- Is that a crime?
- Yes.

40:19.208 --> 40:21.461
Doctor who, exactly?

40:21.920 --> 40:22.967
Ah...

40:24.005 --> 40:25.382
That's classified.

40:25.423 --> 40:28.017
- Classified by whom?
- God knows.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.932
Do you work for him?

40:30.011 --> 40:33.515
He's my friend,
if friend is the right word.

40:34.724 --> 40:36.397
I haven't seen him in a while.

40:39.312 --> 40:44.034
I had something I wanted to tell him,
but stuff always gets in the way.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.865
Stuff does that.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.538
Help me!

40:51.574 --> 40:54.202
- Help! Help me!
- That's her.

40:55.828 --> 40:57.546
Amy?

40:57.580 --> 40:59.207
- Help me, please!
- What's wrong?

40:59.290 --> 41:00.837
I need to tell you something.
It's important.

41:00.917 --> 41:02.214
- Doctor!
- It's really, really important.

41:02.293 --> 41:04.387
- Doctor, quickly!
- What, now?

41:11.260 --> 41:14.059
Canton! Canton! Are you okay?

41:14.180 --> 41:16.023
Is he all right?

41:16.265 --> 41:18.313
Just unconscious. Got a proper whack.

41:18.434 --> 41:20.482
Doctor, I need to tell you something.

41:20.561 --> 41:22.154
- I have to tell you it now.
- Not a great moment.

41:22.230 --> 41:24.733
No, it's important. It has to be now.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.864
Help! Help me!

41:31.030 --> 41:33.283
- Help me!
- Doctor,

41:35.326 --> 41:36.748
I'm pregnant.

41:51.592 --> 41:54.095
That's it, the astronaut.

42:09.694 --> 42:12.413
- Help me!
- Get down!

42:12.822 --> 42:15.666
- What are you doing?
- Saving your life!

42:15.700 --> 42:17.702
No!

42:53.654 --> 42:55.497
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shoot you.

42:56.032 --> 42:57.830
Thirty seconds and counting.

42:57.909 --> 43:00.162
We are still go with Apollo 77.

43:00.661 --> 43:01.913
They are everywhere.

43:01.996 --> 43:04.294
It's like they edit themselves
out of your memory

43:04.540 --> 43:06.884
- as soon as you look away
- Twenty seconds and counting.

43:06.959 --> 43:08.632
We still don't know
what they look like.

43:08.795 --> 43:11.218
As long as there 3 been
something in the corner of your eye

43:11.297 --> 43:13.550
or creaking in your house
or breathing under your bed

43:13.633 --> 43:14.885
or voices through a wall

43:14.967 --> 43:15.968
T minus 10...

43:16.135 --> 43:18.638
We are not fighting an
alien invasion.

43:18.721 --> 43:23.318
- We're leading a revolution.
- Five, four; three,

43:23.392 --> 43:25.269
two, one...

43:26.437 --> 43:28.940
Good luck and godspeed
