WEBVTT

00:00.930 --> 00:02.557
<i>Previously on Ugly Betty...</i>

00:02.632 --> 00:04.030
It's nice to meet you, I'm Jesse.

00:04.133 --> 00:05.964
Ooh! Strong handshake.

00:06.002 --> 00:07.128
Okay, I'll see you around, neighbor.

00:07.203 --> 00:08.568
Yeah, okay.

00:08.804 --> 00:12.001
In case you've forgotten, I am
the Editor-in-Chief of this magazine.

00:12.041 --> 00:14.601
In case you've forgotten,
I'm the Editor-in-Chief, too.

00:14.644 --> 00:16.009
We should start trusting each other.

00:16.045 --> 00:19.503
I'd say trusting you
would be making a rookie mistake.

00:19.615 --> 00:21.242
You seem
to have everything so together.

00:21.283 --> 00:23.512
And I thought maybe
you could help me turn things around

00:23.551 --> 00:25.416
by getting me a job here.

00:25.453 --> 00:27.614
<i>Perfect timing. Welcome to Mode.</i>

00:27.656 --> 00:30.056
Most of you have had a chance
to meet Kimmie Keegan.

00:30.091 --> 00:33.527
Wilhelmina and I are promoting her
to Associate Editor.

00:35.163 --> 00:36.824
That's a big promotion.

00:36.898 --> 00:38.365
Yeah, it was your idea.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.594
I should thank you.

00:39.668 --> 00:41.499
But I won't, because I'm popular,

00:41.536 --> 00:43.970
<i>and popular people
aren't nice to unpopular people.</i>

00:44.005 --> 00:46.064
<i>It's just the natural order of things.</i>

00:51.646 --> 00:53.341
It's not gonna be a problem.

00:53.381 --> 00:55.349
I didn't let Kimmie get to me
in high school.

00:55.383 --> 00:56.509
I won't let her get to me here.

00:56.551 --> 00:59.952
I'm just saying, she used you.

00:59.988 --> 01:04.424
I always knew she was
the same old "rhymes with buh-zitch. "

01:04.458 --> 01:09.191
Okay, Lil' Hilda.
I was naive to trust Kimmie Keegan.

01:09.263 --> 01:11.527
But what can I do about it now?
Nothing.

01:11.598 --> 01:15.466
You can make sure that she's not
putting a steak knife in your back.

01:15.502 --> 01:16.935
But it's not a competition.

01:16.970 --> 01:18.961
And you know what?
We're both gonna be so busy,

01:19.006 --> 01:21.099
we probably will never
run into each other.

01:21.141 --> 01:22.768
It's like time to make
a decision already.

01:22.810 --> 01:25.540
I mean, it's not my fault
I wear clothes so well, right?

01:25.579 --> 01:27.342
- What can I do?
- Kimmie?

01:27.381 --> 01:30.350
This is Nika and Fiorina.
They're just getting me ready.

01:34.455 --> 01:36.821
And you are at my desk because...

01:36.857 --> 01:39.325
<i>I'm just getting ready for a lunch
with Talia from French Vogue.</i>

01:39.359 --> 01:43.056
We're discussing a benefit
to save the llamas. We'll be done soon.

01:43.130 --> 01:44.187
- Daniel!
- Daniel!

01:44.263 --> 01:45.855
Good morning, Betty.
Good morning, Kimmie.

01:45.932 --> 01:48.901
I ran into Beau Flynn at Marquee.
He has a film at Sundance.

01:48.968 --> 01:50.196
Your plumber called.

01:50.236 --> 01:52.602
<i>He wants to do a party,
and I said Mode would co-sponsor.</i>

01:52.638 --> 01:54.538
There is a clog.
He wants to shut off your water.

01:54.574 --> 01:58.135
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
First things first. Betty.

01:58.978 --> 02:01.845
Thank you, Daniel.
I have a lot to go over with you.

02:01.881 --> 02:03.712
Like what?

02:03.750 --> 02:07.652
The plumber, maybe just that for now.

02:07.687 --> 02:09.176
Okay, then how about food?

02:09.222 --> 02:12.350
I'm gonna need breakfast if we're
planning a major Sundance blowout.

02:12.391 --> 02:14.655
- Huge news, Kimmie.
- I'm feeling you, bro.

02:14.727 --> 02:15.751
Come on,
let's go make it happen.

02:15.828 --> 02:18.422
Is there any chance I could get
a little breakie, too? I'm famished.

02:18.498 --> 02:19.487
Yeah, sure. Betty, do you mind

02:19.565 --> 02:21.760
getting a little something for Kimmie,
too? Thanks.

02:21.801 --> 02:25.327
Yeah, I'd be happy to.
"Feeling you, bro. "

02:33.512 --> 02:34.638
There it is. Breakfast.

02:34.679 --> 02:37.944
Thanks.
I'll let you know if I need anything else.

02:37.983 --> 02:41.282
Actually, you know,
if you do need something else,

02:41.319 --> 02:44.755
you should probably do it yourself.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.826
I was happy to get you breakfast
because Daniel asked me to,

02:47.861 --> 02:49.350
but I work for Daniel.

02:49.427 --> 02:52.885
Whatever. Just remember,
I'm an editor now. See?

02:52.964 --> 02:56.058
"Kimberly Keegan. Associate Editor. "
Taste that.

03:00.572 --> 03:04.372
Well, we have like 1,000
associate editors, you know.

03:04.409 --> 03:07.002
What's your title?
What's your card say?

03:07.044 --> 03:08.671
I don't have a card.

03:08.712 --> 03:12.648
Oh, right.
It's because you're an assistant. Darn.

03:14.985 --> 03:19.786
Editor. Assistant to Editor.
Editor. Assistant.

03:19.824 --> 03:22.850
In just two weeks, I've gotten higher
than you have in two years.

03:22.927 --> 03:26.863
You know, I just wonder if you're gonna
be an assistant for the rest of your life.

03:26.897 --> 03:29.866
And you can keep the card.
I have plenty.

03:35.339 --> 03:37.603
The magazine industry
is getting hit hard.

03:37.641 --> 03:41.202
I know I'm just an accountant,
but budgets are a lot like fashion.

03:41.245 --> 03:43.577
You'd rather not see red.

03:43.614 --> 03:44.842
Very funny.

03:44.882 --> 03:47.349
Perhaps we can wrap this up.
I have a meeting with Tom Ford.

03:47.383 --> 03:50.352
- Yeah, this was great, Mort.
- You two, stop.

03:50.386 --> 03:54.982
I may not be an owner of this company,
but my last name is on this building,

03:55.058 --> 03:57.117
and I am telling you to wake up.

03:57.193 --> 03:58.751
Mom, we've got it covered.

03:58.828 --> 04:00.659
I don't think you do.

04:00.697 --> 04:04.531
Now, Alexis may have had
the occasional murderous impulse,

04:04.567 --> 04:08.333
but she also had a keen mind
for numbers, which you two do not.

04:08.371 --> 04:11.204
You need to bring in someone
to run this business.

04:12.408 --> 04:17.175
Dear Claire. Setting us straight
like a poor man's Sally Field.

04:17.213 --> 04:19.875
Neither I nor Daniel
cobbled our power together

04:19.916 --> 04:21.213
with the intention of giving it away.

04:21.250 --> 04:24.220
I'm not talking
about giving anything away.

04:24.254 --> 04:26.654
I'm talking about a CFO,
a managing director,

04:26.689 --> 04:28.883
someone who reports directly to you.

04:28.957 --> 04:31.721
Mort, enlighten my friends.

04:31.793 --> 04:35.285
Please, give them
an honest assessment of our finances.

04:35.364 --> 04:38.629
If we keep going the way we're going,
before you know it,

04:38.667 --> 04:43.502
you two will go from being the owners
of Meade to the owners of nothing.

04:51.280 --> 04:53.475
You look like you could use
a little help there.

04:53.515 --> 04:56.075
- Oh! Hi, Jesse.
- Let me get a couple of those.

04:56.118 --> 04:58.450
No, no, no, don't worry about me.
I'm fine.

04:58.487 --> 05:02.287
Seriously, hand them over.
My parents taught me to be polite.

05:02.357 --> 05:04.951
- Well, thank you.
- Sure.

05:05.027 --> 05:11.590
So what's the guitar for? Got a gig?
Am I using that word correctly?

05:12.733 --> 05:16.794
Yeah, it's an open mike night at some
coffee shop. I'll probably get booed.

05:16.837 --> 05:18.236
Oh, no!

05:18.806 --> 05:20.068
Maybe not.

05:20.107 --> 05:22.905
You know, last week, some dude
read 10 pages of his journal

05:22.944 --> 05:25.980
and then ended with a harmonica solo,
and they liked him, so...

05:26.015 --> 05:28.312
You'll be fine.

05:28.349 --> 05:31.182
So how goes the fast-paced life
of a magazine editor?

05:31.218 --> 05:33.482
Oh, I'm not an editor.

05:33.521 --> 05:36.854
I mean, I want to be,
but for now, I'm just an assistant.

05:36.924 --> 05:39.222
I don't even have business cards yet.

05:39.260 --> 05:42.195
I hear that. It's like what does it take
to get noticed in this town?

05:42.229 --> 05:43.218
- Right?
- Yeah.

05:43.297 --> 05:45.527
I mean, I feel like
everybody else is getting chances,

05:45.566 --> 05:48.000
while I sit around
and grab people breakfast.

05:48.035 --> 05:51.800
You know, Super B,
you strike me as a dreamer.

05:51.838 --> 05:54.864
- Well, yeah, I mean, I guess I am.
- Me, too.

05:54.908 --> 05:57.877
That's why I tell myself every day,
"Don't give in to the doubt,

05:57.911 --> 06:00.539
"and if you want something,
you gotta go for it. "

06:00.580 --> 06:02.741
<i>Go for it, Betty</i>

06:02.782 --> 06:04.647
Um, what are you doing?

06:04.684 --> 06:07.312
I'm serenading you with advice.
Isn't it obvious?

06:07.354 --> 06:10.915
<i>Go for it, Betty
No need to get sweaty</i>

06:10.991 --> 06:15.928
<i>Just go for it, Betty
I know that you're ready</i>

06:17.030 --> 06:18.657
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

06:20.734 --> 06:22.258
Tell me more.

06:22.302 --> 06:24.964
<i>So I was leaving and the manager's
like, "Are you Kimmie from Mode?"</i>

06:25.005 --> 06:26.495
And I was like, "Yeah. " 'Cause I am.

06:26.539 --> 06:28.507
And he says, "Come back tomorrow.
It's gonna be bumping. "

06:28.541 --> 06:30.735
I say "Why?" He goes,
"Are you down with Young Jeezy?"

06:30.776 --> 06:32.641
I was like,
"Am I down with Young Jeezy?"

06:32.678 --> 06:34.339
- Hey, Kimmie.
- Hey, sexy.

06:34.380 --> 06:37.406
Busy, busy. Let's talk later, okay?

06:37.449 --> 06:39.314
<i>So then,
I ran into Jade Frampton from Elle...</i>

06:39.351 --> 06:41.785
Did she just give us the
"Busy, busy, let's talk later" blow-off?

06:41.854 --> 06:44.084
- We invented that blow-off.
- Yes, we did.

06:44.156 --> 06:45.589
To remind the little people around here

06:45.624 --> 06:48.559
that we are king and queen
of this particular prom.

06:48.594 --> 06:51.620
But now Kimmie's turning it on us.

06:51.663 --> 06:54.029
I don't like it
when the masses get ideas, Marc.

06:54.066 --> 06:56.500
- We best keep an eye on that one.
- Yes.

06:56.535 --> 06:58.765
Okay, people, listen up.

06:58.804 --> 07:03.002
Let's talk March.
Let's talk Sizzling Hot list.

07:03.042 --> 07:06.307
The submissions were great,
everyone came in with very good ideas.

07:06.345 --> 07:08.404
I was only blind with rage two times.

07:08.447 --> 07:10.381
Okay, here we go,
assignments.

07:10.416 --> 07:15.250
So who is sizzling hot?
Russo, Sizzling Hot Resort.

07:15.319 --> 07:17.412
Emily, Sizzling Hot Shoes.

07:17.488 --> 07:22.425
Kimmie, Sizzling Hot Club.
Nice work, really nice pitch.

07:22.460 --> 07:25.224
Peter, Sizzling Hot Hobby.
Cara, Sizzling Hot...

07:25.263 --> 07:27.254
Charlie... Robbie...
Sizzling Hot Workout...

07:27.298 --> 07:30.597
<i>Go for it, Betty
You know that you're ready</i>

07:30.635 --> 07:33.934
<i>Just go for it, Betty
Go for it, Betty</i>

07:35.773 --> 07:38.867
How come all those people
get to do something in the Hot issue?

07:38.910 --> 07:40.639
Because they submitted ideas.

07:40.678 --> 07:44.045
- Why didn't I submit an idea?
- You tell me.

07:44.082 --> 07:45.811
I guess I didn't know I could.

07:45.850 --> 07:47.715
Of course you could, Betty.
You've been here two years.

07:47.752 --> 07:49.242
If you want something,
gotta open up your mouth.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.049
Just like every time I screw up.

07:51.122 --> 07:54.181
Okay. Can I do something
for the Hot issue?

07:54.257 --> 07:55.747
Yes.

07:55.826 --> 07:57.657
Really? Yes? You mean it?

07:57.694 --> 07:59.924
- I mean it. Pitch me something.
- When?

07:59.963 --> 08:01.555
- Now.
- Now?

08:01.598 --> 08:05.034
Do you want this or not?
Sizzling Hot. Go.

08:05.068 --> 08:07.434
Okay, Sizzling Hot...

08:11.174 --> 08:12.869
Sizzling Hot...

08:14.344 --> 08:15.641
- Fruit!
- What?

08:15.679 --> 08:18.307
You know, how everyone's always
trying to find that new thing to eat,

08:18.348 --> 08:21.909
that thing that will increase brain power
or reduce stress,

08:21.985 --> 08:23.179
something they can keep in their desk

08:23.253 --> 08:27.019
and pop in their mouth to get an edge
in today's hyper-competitive world.

08:27.057 --> 08:28.957
The Sizzling Hot Fruit!

08:32.429 --> 08:35.693
This is the first time I get to vote.
The first time!

08:35.731 --> 08:39.188
<i>Papi, last year you voted five times
on Dancing with the Stars.</i>

08:39.235 --> 08:42.693
Only because that Kristi Yamaguchi
is an Asian ball of fire.

08:42.738 --> 08:47.038
But this is for the President.
I've dreamt about it for a long time.

08:47.710 --> 08:50.338
Well, you're not the only one
who's excited about the election.

08:50.379 --> 08:51.869
I got big plans!

08:51.914 --> 08:54.712
- What?
- To promote my shop.

08:54.783 --> 08:56.774
Yeah, the polls are right
around the corner,

08:56.852 --> 08:59.753
and Justin is gonna hand out flyers
dressed in a red, white and blue suit.

08:59.955 --> 09:01.479
No.

09:01.524 --> 09:04.254
I think it's gonna be
a really big day for Hilda's Beautilities.

09:04.293 --> 09:05.783
And for democracy.

09:05.828 --> 09:07.318
I got a job!

09:07.863 --> 09:08.921
- Hi.
- Hi.

09:08.964 --> 09:12.525
Betty, I left Mexico so my family
wouldn't have to sell fruit on the street.

09:12.568 --> 09:16.731
No. I get to choose
this winter's Sizzling Hot Fruit.

09:16.771 --> 09:20.434
<i>It's a quarter page in Mode
with a picture, and I'm in charge.</i>

09:20.475 --> 09:21.999
I'm in charge!

09:25.446 --> 09:27.880
Mmm! I like the carambola.

09:27.916 --> 09:29.781
Uh-uh, so five minutes ago.

09:29.851 --> 09:32.046
You're right,
it was everywhere last winter.

09:32.120 --> 09:33.144
What about the durian?

09:33.221 --> 09:36.190
No, this thing stinks.
Pass me the dragon's eye.

09:36.224 --> 09:40.627
Don't bother. The name is much more
interesting than the flavor, believe me.

09:40.662 --> 09:42.425
- Kiwi?
- Ki-won't.

09:42.463 --> 09:44.090
You're right. It's boring.

09:44.132 --> 09:46.999
I need to find something dazzling,
unpredictable.

09:47.035 --> 09:48.366
It might be my only chance.

09:48.403 --> 09:50.303
Hang on. I got it!

09:51.172 --> 09:52.605
The tico berry!

09:52.640 --> 09:55.006
What? Dad,
I've never even heard of that.

09:55.043 --> 09:58.307
It's Brazilian, very rare.

09:58.345 --> 10:01.212
I learned about it
from this busboy once.

10:01.248 --> 10:03.842
Interesting guy. Here it is.

10:05.586 --> 10:07.986
<i>Papi, that's one ugly berry.</i>

10:08.021 --> 10:10.922
Well, don't judge it by the outside.
Find out what's inside.

10:10.958 --> 10:15.122
"Succulent, flavorful, rumored
to have special healing powers. "

10:15.162 --> 10:16.527
- Hey.
- Let me look this up.

10:16.563 --> 10:19.794
Succulent and flavorful,
reminds me of me.

10:19.833 --> 10:21.494
Mom, inappropriate.

10:21.535 --> 10:25.528
Well, there's not much here,
except something on someone's blog.

10:28.342 --> 10:29.832
Oh, my God.

10:29.876 --> 10:31.343
What?

10:31.979 --> 10:33.139
Oh, my God.

10:33.180 --> 10:34.204
What?

10:35.682 --> 10:37.376
All right, people, listen up.

10:37.450 --> 10:39.350
We have a very important
announcement.

10:39.385 --> 10:42.286
Daniel, she's your girl, so go ahead.

10:42.321 --> 10:45.552
Betty has scored a giant coup
for the Sizzling Hot issue.

10:45.591 --> 10:47.855
Her choice for Sizzling Hot Fruit, the...

10:47.893 --> 10:49.155
Tico berry.

10:50.263 --> 10:54.290
Is the beloved fruit of supermodel
Adriana Lima.

10:55.835 --> 10:57.996
"Growing up as a young girl in Brazil,

10:58.037 --> 11:01.234
"Adriana would spend the summers
on her grandfather's farm

11:01.274 --> 11:04.334
"where he grew tico berries.
She ate them every day.

11:04.377 --> 11:07.312
"She credits them
for making her beautiful. "

11:07.847 --> 11:09.838
Amanda, they don't have any
in the cafeteria.

11:09.915 --> 11:12.475
It's not for me. It's for my friend.

11:12.551 --> 11:17.511
<i>So la Lima has agreed to a cover
and a feature story for us.</i>

11:17.590 --> 11:20.625
<i>This is big.
Adriana has never done a Mode cover.</i>

11:20.660 --> 11:22.684
So we're gonna cut
the Sizzling Hot budget,

11:22.727 --> 11:23.989
go all-in on the shoot.

11:24.029 --> 11:26.862
Betty. It's yours. Run with it.

11:29.401 --> 11:30.459
What do you mean?

11:30.502 --> 11:34.233
You made it happen. We want you
to be the project manager.

11:34.272 --> 11:35.500
Really?

11:38.276 --> 11:40.403
Well, that's initiative,
people.

11:40.445 --> 11:44.040
Sometimes it comes
in unlikely brown packages.

11:44.115 --> 11:45.139
Thank you.

11:45.216 --> 11:48.583
Sorry, Kimmie. We're gonna have
to cut the Hot Club. Maybe next time.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.884
That's so great.
I'm so happy for you.

11:50.922 --> 11:53.413
Congratulations.
You did it. Awesome.

11:54.292 --> 11:56.453
Thanks. Thank you.

11:56.728 --> 11:58.320
Game on, Betty.

12:00.000 --> 12:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:18.182 --> 12:21.208
Marc, the car is not here.
Make it get here.

12:21.285 --> 12:23.446
Well, do something. Now.

12:24.722 --> 12:27.122
Aren't you Wilhelmina Slater?

12:27.157 --> 12:28.181
Dear Lord.

12:29.293 --> 12:31.818
I'm sorry to bug you.
I know you must hate this,

12:31.862 --> 12:34.524
but I am such an admirer.

12:35.432 --> 12:38.094
Well, you're probably either gay
or a gossip.

12:38.135 --> 12:41.069
Neither, I'm afraid. Connor Owens.

12:41.871 --> 12:44.101
Connor Owens. From Crittenden?

12:44.140 --> 12:46.700
Formerly.
I just took my stock options and ran.

12:46.743 --> 12:48.370
You did a nice job over there.

12:48.411 --> 12:52.370
A good book always sells itself.
The trick is marketing the brand.

12:52.448 --> 12:54.507
Well, that's not happening
for our company.

12:54.584 --> 12:56.575
Really? That's criminal.

12:56.652 --> 13:00.088
Any publisher in town
would love to have your titles.

13:02.825 --> 13:05.487
Uh, nice meeting you, Connor.

13:08.865 --> 13:13.165
Connor. Would you have any interest
in coming to Meade?

13:13.202 --> 13:15.636
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

13:15.671 --> 13:17.832
Danny Meade and I don't quite
get along.

13:17.874 --> 13:19.671
Really? How so?

13:19.709 --> 13:22.506
Let's just say
there's a little bit of history there.

13:22.577 --> 13:25.978
You take care, Miss Slater.
It was great to meet you.

13:30.952 --> 13:33.420
Daniel, hey, I was just wondering
if there's anything I could do

13:33.488 --> 13:35.046
to help out on the Adriana Lima shoot.

13:35.090 --> 13:38.958
Yeah, talk to Betty.
Suzuki. Always great to see you.

13:38.994 --> 13:41.519
<i>Well, Danny,
we love a scoop at Fashion Buzz,</i>

13:41.563 --> 13:44.828
and landing Adriana Lima
for the cover of your March issue

13:44.866 --> 13:47.164
is two scoops with whipped cream
and sprinkles.

13:47.202 --> 13:50.638
Well, the truth is, it's my incredibly
capable assistant who made it happen.

13:50.672 --> 13:51.969
You should talk to her.

13:52.007 --> 13:54.805
Little person does good. Great angle.

13:54.876 --> 13:57.344
Where is this plucky lady
with a dream?

13:57.379 --> 13:59.870
- Betty! Betty!
- Yes?

14:02.283 --> 14:03.648
Makeup.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.014
Okay, I can't stand
to see makeup done badly.

14:09.056 --> 14:10.785
I was on TV once,
and I know how to do it.

14:10.825 --> 14:12.156
Please let me help you.

14:12.193 --> 14:14.354
Um, no, thank you, I'm fine.

14:14.395 --> 14:18.661
No, you're not. I mean,
what you're doing is seriously awful.

14:18.699 --> 14:19.757
Well, maybe you and I have...

14:19.800 --> 14:22.837
Look, if you're gonna represent
the magazine, you have to look good.

14:22.872 --> 14:24.805
<i>Okay, if it's important to Mode,
it's important to me.</i>

14:24.839 --> 14:27.171
- Keep your eyes still.
- Why?

14:28.709 --> 14:30.506
- Eyelashes?
- Trust me.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.911
People watching at home
go straight to the eyes.

14:33.948 --> 14:36.781
I hate to say this, but congratulations.

14:36.817 --> 14:40.583
You know, you've done a really
good job with this whole Adriana thing.

14:40.621 --> 14:42.316
Wow. Thank you.

14:43.890 --> 14:47.417
So do you want to practice
what you're gonna say?

14:47.460 --> 14:49.087
Well, I am a little nervous.

14:51.764 --> 14:56.098
<i>This unique cover gives Mode
a special opportunity</i>

14:56.135 --> 14:58.569
to show a new side of Adriana.

14:58.605 --> 15:01.597
One of her favorite sayings is,
"Tico is life. "

15:01.674 --> 15:05.804
So this incredible photographer we've
hired is going to use the tico berry

15:05.879 --> 15:11.681
as a gateway to Adriana's childhood
memories, as in a surrealist painting.

15:11.718 --> 15:16.212
I know that I'll be the first in line
when it comes out on the newsstands.

15:16.256 --> 15:17.382
Awesome.

15:17.423 --> 15:22.087
I forgot to tell my family that
I'm gonna be on TV. I'll be back.

15:22.262 --> 15:25.094
Okay, we'll just finish
when you get back.

15:36.275 --> 15:39.176
How do you guys lift these lights?
I mean, they look so heavy.

15:40.279 --> 15:44.147
- I work out a lot.
- Yeah, I can tell.

15:44.182 --> 15:46.480
So do you think this is gonna be
bright enough for TV?

15:46.518 --> 15:49.282
Yeah, we're good.
Any more and it might be too hot.

15:49.321 --> 15:53.052
Well, I don't think it's bad
if things get too hot. Do you?

15:54.760 --> 15:55.988
Well...

16:05.236 --> 16:07.864
<i>Papi, the polls open
at 7:00 a. m. tomorrow.</i>

16:07.905 --> 16:09.167
You gotta be dressed.

16:09.240 --> 16:12.368
I can't have my clients see you
in your crazy old man pajamas.

16:12.443 --> 16:15.537
You worry about yourself.
You're crabby in the morning.

16:15.613 --> 16:17.080
I'm cute.

16:17.949 --> 16:19.211
Justin!

16:19.817 --> 16:21.114
What?

16:23.254 --> 16:24.585
I'm not wearing this.

16:24.622 --> 16:27.921
Sweetheart, that is so good.
Who could resist that?

16:27.959 --> 16:29.586
Anyone with taste.

16:29.627 --> 16:31.151
- Come on.
- You look great.

16:36.067 --> 16:38.262
Hello. What?

16:39.337 --> 16:41.532
Aunt Betty's gonna be on television!

16:45.443 --> 16:48.411
<i>Stylish people of Mode,
could we have a little quiet, please?</i>

16:48.478 --> 16:51.379
We go live in five, four...

16:56.052 --> 16:59.579
This is Suzuki St. Pierre
with breaking news.

16:59.656 --> 17:02.784
<i>Mode has scored Adriana Lima
for their Sizzling Hot issue,</i>

17:02.826 --> 17:07.593
and it's all the doing of this young lady,
Betty Suarez. Speak, Betty.

17:08.531 --> 17:13.594
Well, Suzuki, I was researching
our Sizzling Hot Fruit, the tico berry,

17:13.637 --> 17:18.369
when I discovered that Adriana's
grandfather grows them on his farm.

17:18.441 --> 17:19.999
Farms. We know what those are.

17:20.076 --> 17:21.941
Those are the things
fashion people knock down

17:21.978 --> 17:23.638
so we can build our weekend houses.

17:25.482 --> 17:26.574
Tell us more, Betty.

17:26.616 --> 17:29.482
What other newsworthy crumbs
can you drop on the ground

17:29.518 --> 17:31.952
<i>for gossip-hungry
Fashion Buzz viewers?</i>

17:31.987 --> 17:34.012
Wow.
She's doing so great.

17:34.056 --> 17:35.751
I bet you she gets her own show
after this.

17:35.791 --> 17:37.349
Quiet, I want to hear what she says.

17:37.393 --> 17:38.553
<i>Steamy Brazil, was it?</i>

17:38.594 --> 17:42.894
Well, Suzuki, this unique cover

17:42.931 --> 17:48.267
<i>is a great chance for Mode to show...</i>

17:51.940 --> 17:57.537
And... Show a different side of Adriana.

17:58.714 --> 18:04.675
Not so old... I mean, not the same old...
Not the same old thing.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.382
SUZUKl: Now, does the tico berry
go good with vodka?

18:07.423 --> 18:09.356
Would it make a good tico-tini?

18:09.390 --> 18:10.584
Her...

18:12.026 --> 18:14.961
Her berries... Adriana's berries...

18:16.664 --> 18:21.397
Adriana's berries have
never been seen before.

18:24.305 --> 18:25.636
Sorry. Sorry.

18:29.277 --> 18:31.905
- Holy crap.
- There goes her show.

18:31.946 --> 18:35.882
But you know what...
I'm sorry, just one second.

18:38.152 --> 18:40.382
- Suzuki, hi.
- Hi.

18:40.421 --> 18:43.254
As our girl Adriana says, "Tico is life!"

18:43.291 --> 18:45.282
And when you see this cover,
you'll know why.

18:45.326 --> 18:48.762
I know I'm gonna be first in line at
the newsstand the day it comes out.

18:48.796 --> 18:51.992
SUZUKl: Well, you'll be right
behind me, 'cause I can't wait.

18:52.032 --> 18:54.364
<i>You heard it first,
Adriana Lima in Mode,</i>

18:54.401 --> 18:57.234
from Kimmie Keegan, Associate Editor.

18:57.304 --> 18:59.329
SUZUKl: Great work, Kimmie.
Wonderful job.

19:00.774 --> 19:03.470
Betty, so everything you've done so far

19:03.510 --> 19:06.172
to make this cover happen
has been fantastic.

19:06.213 --> 19:08.704
You're working very hard.
You're putting the pieces together.

19:08.749 --> 19:12.310
Just rip it off, Daniel.
The TV spot was a disaster.

19:13.453 --> 19:17.116
Kimmie will work on the cover with you
to add a little polish.

19:17.157 --> 19:18.454
Any questions?

19:19.793 --> 19:20.885
No questions.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.724
I'm so thrilled about this.

19:22.763 --> 19:25.095
I'm really excited for us
to be working together, Betty.

19:25.132 --> 19:29.091
Moving on. Anyone's name
who is not on the masthead may leave.

19:37.843 --> 19:41.745
You are unbelievable.
You sabotaged me.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.875
It's not my fault you don't have the face
or pores for television.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.852
No, you just couldn't stand
that I was in charge,

19:47.887 --> 19:50.378
so you had to weasel your way in there.

19:50.422 --> 19:51.980
I happen to like being in the spotlight,

19:52.024 --> 19:54.618
and, unfortunately,
there's just not room for the two of us.

19:54.660 --> 19:58.687
Yeah, well, we have to work as a team,
so it'll have to be.

19:58.731 --> 20:00.221
That's one way to look at it.

20:00.266 --> 20:01.426
And what's the other?

20:01.467 --> 20:02.832
The shoot is in two days.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.928
My bet is that by the time it happens,
one of us will be gone.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.030
And it's not gonna be me.

20:16.247 --> 20:18.875
You know, Daniel, I was thinking
about what your mother said.

20:18.917 --> 20:20.475
About hiring a CFO?

20:20.518 --> 20:22.782
Well, I only know him by reputation,

20:22.821 --> 20:26.655
but I heard that Connor Owens
is an exceptional...

20:26.691 --> 20:27.749
No.

20:27.792 --> 20:30.761
Well, he has the best business mind
this side of Iger.

20:30.795 --> 20:32.353
Absolutely not.

20:36.601 --> 20:39.092
Daniel, I thought
we had reached a place

20:39.170 --> 20:41.297
where we could work together
on things.

20:41.372 --> 20:43.840
Isn't there a chance
you could put whatever silly issues

20:43.875 --> 20:47.641
you have with him aside
and do what's best for Meade?

20:54.618 --> 20:57.781
Daniel, I am so sorry to bother you,

20:57.821 --> 21:00.915
but I really don't think
that I can work with Kimmie.

21:00.958 --> 21:02.118
Why not?

21:02.159 --> 21:04.593
Well, I don't trust her,

21:04.628 --> 21:08.758
and she brings out this side of me
where I want to scratch her eyes out.

21:10.200 --> 21:13.636
Betty, do you think
I like working with Wilhelmina?

21:14.304 --> 21:15.464
Well, no.

21:15.539 --> 21:19.134
There isn't a day that goes by that I'm
not fighting with her about something.

21:19.176 --> 21:22.407
Like it or not, she's my partner.
We have this magazine to put out.

21:22.446 --> 21:24.539
But Kimmie's trying
to take my project from me.

21:24.581 --> 21:26.845
- So don't let her.
- No, but she doesn't play fair.

21:26.884 --> 21:28.351
That's her problem.

21:28.385 --> 21:32.617
You gotta worry about yourself.
This is what you wished for. Right?

21:32.656 --> 21:34.646
As you move up,
things aren't gonna get easier.

21:34.690 --> 21:39.024
My advice to you, be a professional.
Take the high road.

21:41.797 --> 21:44.095
Then Christina Aguilera
walks in with her child

21:44.166 --> 21:46.532
and she's breastfeeding...

21:49.672 --> 21:51.401
Hey.
Hey.

21:57.813 --> 21:59.110
How did it happen?

21:59.148 --> 22:00.843
We used to be the ones
spreading rumors,

22:00.883 --> 22:03.249
mocking co-workers,
ruining self-esteem.

22:03.286 --> 22:05.447
Because God made us pretty,
God made us mean.

22:05.488 --> 22:06.955
Sometimes he gives with both hands.

22:06.989 --> 22:09.184
Well, look around, it is Kimmie's world.

22:09.225 --> 22:12.285
Okay, but before we go nuclear on her,
we need more.

22:12.328 --> 22:14.522
I agree.
And you know me, I hate going nuclear.

22:14.562 --> 22:16.086
You love going nuclear.

22:16.164 --> 22:19.600
I do love going nuclear,
and destroying someone is fun.

22:19.668 --> 22:21.499
Look, it's sad Betty.

22:25.807 --> 22:27.798
Betty, we need to talk to you.

22:27.842 --> 22:32.506
There's a problem, something that
affects all of us, like global warning.

22:32.547 --> 22:34.014
It's Kimmie.

22:34.049 --> 22:38.179
And the inconvenient truth
is that she's evil. She has to go.

22:38.219 --> 22:39.743
What do you mean "go"?

22:39.788 --> 22:42.279
- We need to kill her.
- Get her fired.

22:42.324 --> 22:44.053
- Whatever.
- And we need your help.

22:44.092 --> 22:46.959
She's working with you
on the shoot. Right?

22:51.666 --> 22:53.531
I don't know, guys.
Getting someone fired...

22:53.568 --> 22:55.762
Betty, she threatened your family.

22:55.803 --> 22:56.792
What? When?

22:56.870 --> 22:58.132
Okay, she didn't do that,

22:58.172 --> 23:02.404
but she did weasel her way
into your big moment, right?

23:02.443 --> 23:03.535
Yes.

23:05.145 --> 23:07.045
It's not exactly taking the high road.

23:07.081 --> 23:09.174
Betty, yes or no?

23:13.053 --> 23:14.111
No.

23:20.327 --> 23:21.988
People, behold.

23:22.029 --> 23:25.487
This is the Loulou de la Falaise
reproduction

23:25.566 --> 23:29.332
<i>of Marie Antoinette's
famous framboise necklace.</i>

23:29.370 --> 23:31.235
Poor girl loved her berries.

23:31.271 --> 23:33.262
Betty, do you think
this might be a good idea

23:33.307 --> 23:35.104
for the Adriana Lima shoot?

23:35.142 --> 23:36.631
Maybe. Yeah.

23:36.676 --> 23:38.337
It's just a suggestion.

23:38.378 --> 23:41.506
Could be the perfect complement to
that beautiful Oscar de la Renta gown.

23:47.153 --> 23:49.053
- Hey, good-looking.
- Hi.

23:49.088 --> 23:51.648
I haven't seen you since Milan.
How're you feeling?

23:51.691 --> 23:52.715
I've been great.

23:52.759 --> 23:55.887
Except for my broken finger.
You should see the other girl.

23:57.030 --> 23:58.122
Joking, joking.

23:58.197 --> 24:00.825
But I'm really happy to be here
to do this photo shoot

24:00.900 --> 24:03.164
with my beloved tico berries.

24:03.202 --> 24:04.897
We are just thrilled to have you.

24:04.937 --> 24:09.033
Kimmie has been telling me
all her ideas for this photo shoot.

24:09.075 --> 24:12.169
The theme of memory is genius.

24:12.211 --> 24:13.371
Kimmie's ideas?

24:13.413 --> 24:15.745
I don't know about genius,
but it could work.

24:15.782 --> 24:17.772
And guess who we got to shoot it?
Philippe Loire.

24:18.917 --> 24:19.975
We saw him at the club last night.

24:20.018 --> 24:21.781
Cliff was supposed to shoot that cover.

24:21.820 --> 24:24.789
That skank needs to be stopped.

24:24.823 --> 24:26.654
Kimmie, what is going on?

24:26.691 --> 24:29.785
I saw on the schedule that you gave out
that Adriana was landing last night,

24:29.861 --> 24:32.694
so I met her at the airport
and introduced myself.

24:32.731 --> 24:35.700
We hit it off. So we went out
for some dinner and some drinks.

24:35.767 --> 24:38.429
And then you told her that my ideas
were your ideas?

24:38.470 --> 24:39.903
Well, maybe you should
have done more

24:39.938 --> 24:42.634
than just send a fruit basket
to her room.

24:42.674 --> 24:44.869
- Adriana, hi.
- Hi.

24:44.910 --> 24:47.708
I'm Betty Suarez. Nice to meet you.
I work here. Actually...

24:47.746 --> 24:52.183
Sorry, but we have to go.
Sorry, guys, but, A-Lim, it's spa time.

24:52.217 --> 24:55.277
I'm sorry to interrupt.
I'll see everybody tomorrow.

24:55.320 --> 24:58.254
And remember, tico is life.

24:59.323 --> 25:02.724
Don't worry about her.
She's just someone's assistant.

25:06.163 --> 25:10.623
Screw the high road. I'm in.
Let's kill Kimmie.

25:17.141 --> 25:18.403
It's a pleasure to be here.

25:18.442 --> 25:19.932
Daniel knows me from Harvard,

25:19.977 --> 25:23.208
but unlike some people in this room,
I didn't grow up rich.

25:23.247 --> 25:25.374
Nobody ever gave me anything.

25:25.416 --> 25:29.785
I grew up in a council flat in Sydney.
If that's where I end up, fine by me.

25:29.820 --> 25:32.448
Is there a point
to this delightful mini-bio?

25:32.490 --> 25:33.855
Daniel.

25:33.891 --> 25:35.222
I never take a job for the money.

25:36.460 --> 25:37.757
When I ran accounts
for Beard & Phelps

25:37.828 --> 25:40.159
and a client didn't like our campaign,

25:40.196 --> 25:42.426
I didn't take "no" from
some VP of marketing

25:42.465 --> 25:44.558
who couldn't find his nuts with a GPS.

25:44.601 --> 25:47.866
I went over that idiot's head,
until I was standing in a room

25:47.904 --> 25:50.940
with the person who had the power
to say yes,

25:50.975 --> 25:53.374
and then that person said yes.

25:53.409 --> 25:54.899
Because if I learned one thing

25:54.944 --> 25:58.243
talking to my old man on a prison
phone through a glass partition,

25:58.281 --> 26:01.773
it's never take on something
you can't defend,

26:01.818 --> 26:05.049
and I can defend this company.

26:05.088 --> 26:07.113
But I won't lie to you,
there's work to do.

26:07.157 --> 26:10.524
You need a new business plan.
Here's what I'd do.

26:11.728 --> 26:14.561
Read it through. It speaks for itself.

26:16.699 --> 26:18.462
Thanks for your time.

26:19.969 --> 26:21.595
Thank you.

26:24.373 --> 26:25.670
Daniel?

26:37.853 --> 26:40.253
It's an odorless, colorless gas.

26:40.289 --> 26:43.122
When she wakes up,
she's got heroin stuffed in her pockets.

26:43.192 --> 26:45.387
Police come in, whisk her away.
Problem solved.

26:45.460 --> 26:48.258
I don't know how I feel
about sending her to prison.

26:48.297 --> 26:51.266
Yeah, I'm gonna have to go with Betty
on this one. Too far, Mandy. Too far.

26:51.333 --> 26:54.530
I say she deserves
whatever horrible punishment she gets.

26:54.570 --> 26:57.232
Marc, your boyfriend's getting cheese
on my couch.

26:57.272 --> 27:01.537
Cliff, napkin. Honey,
I know you're upset and anger-eating

27:01.576 --> 27:05.910
because you lost the Adriana shoot,
but trust me, Kimmie will be dealt with.

27:05.947 --> 27:07.141
It just has to be appropriate.

27:08.349 --> 27:11.045
- Do they still make guillotines?
- Not constructive.

27:11.085 --> 27:14.350
- Wait. That's it!
- Marc, you're scaring me.

27:14.388 --> 27:17.448
The Marie Antoinette necklace that
Wilhelmina wants to use in the shoot.

27:17.525 --> 27:19.220
Yeah, but that was just a suggestion.

27:19.293 --> 27:22.194
That was no suggestion.
That was vintage Slater scheming.

27:22.230 --> 27:23.697
That necklace is up for auction,

27:23.731 --> 27:27.428
<i>and if a Mode cover spikes the price,
Wilhelmina gets a cut.</i>

27:27.468 --> 27:31.097
And if that necklace
isn't around Adriana Lima's neck...

27:31.138 --> 27:33.800
Then someone will lose their head.

27:36.244 --> 27:38.474
Louisa, you look beautiful,

27:38.512 --> 27:41.106
and you have your "I Voted" sticker,
so you get 10% off.

27:41.148 --> 27:42.774
- Right.
- Justin's outside. He'll cash you out.

27:42.816 --> 27:47.082
- All right.
- Okay, thank you. Okay, who's next?

27:47.320 --> 27:49.845
Hi! Come on in, come on in, sit down.

27:50.423 --> 27:54.917
Wow, okay, I'm thinking like
a sexy Michelle Obama,

27:54.995 --> 27:57.930
or maybe a stylish Cindy McCain?

27:57.964 --> 27:59.864
<i>Excuse me, mi hija.</i>

28:00.166 --> 28:03.533
- Oh. Ruminate on that. I'll be right back.
- Okay.

28:03.570 --> 28:04.935
Sweetie, are you going
to take a break soon?

28:04.971 --> 28:06.632
I got business out the wazoo.

28:06.673 --> 28:08.538
But you haven't had
a chance to vote yet.

28:08.575 --> 28:10.042
<i>Yeah, papi, I'll do it if I have time.</i>

28:10.076 --> 28:13.409
<i>Mi hija, do you realize
how important your vote is?</i>

28:13.446 --> 28:15.073
<i>Mi hija, you are an American...</i>

28:15.115 --> 28:18.949
Spare me the civics lesson, okay?
You know what's American?

28:20.453 --> 28:22.421
Making money!

28:22.455 --> 28:24.718
I am not about to slow down
the best day of business

28:24.790 --> 28:27.918
this salon has ever had to vote
on something that I don't care about!

28:27.993 --> 28:31.394
It's got nothing to do with me.
Now I gotta go. I got business.

28:32.765 --> 28:36.030
Hi, sorry about that.
You know what I was thinking?

28:36.068 --> 28:39.299
Senator Clinton,
it's a style that never quits.

28:40.873 --> 28:42.773
All right, just make sure
everyone's okay over there...

28:42.808 --> 28:47.370
OMG, Kimmie. It looks amazing.
You did such an awesome job.

28:47.413 --> 28:49.813
I love how those things look
like they're free-floating in the air.

28:49.848 --> 28:53.682
Yeah, it's Suri-realism. It's this thing
Tom Cruise's daughter invented.

28:53.719 --> 28:54.811
Oh.

28:54.853 --> 28:59.017
But what is that thing
on Adriana's stand-in's neck?

28:59.091 --> 29:00.956
Ew! Marc, check that out.

29:00.993 --> 29:03.223
Ugh! It is awful!

29:04.462 --> 29:09.195
Some giant piece of fruit? What,
did it fall off of Carmen Miranda's hat?

29:09.233 --> 29:10.632
Or is the theme "berries"?

29:10.668 --> 29:11.726
Oh.

29:11.769 --> 29:15.000
Tico berries, strawberries,
what about blueberry?

29:15.039 --> 29:16.404
Or a Halle Berry!

29:17.942 --> 29:19.603
This was Betty's idea, wasn't it?

29:19.644 --> 29:22.477
It was totally Betty's idea,
'cause it sucks.

29:22.513 --> 29:23.878
Do you really think it's that bad?

29:23.915 --> 29:25.576
- Beyond.
- The worst.

29:25.616 --> 29:27.277
I don't know.

29:30.922 --> 29:34.858
Yeah, it blows. Could someone
please lose that necklace ASAP?

29:35.860 --> 29:39.523
Get it off her neck. It's hurting my eyes.
Okay, come on, we don't have all day.

29:39.564 --> 29:42.533
- We set her up, Betty.
- You knock her down.

29:56.813 --> 30:01.876
Since you haven't said anything,
I assume it's a no-go on hiring Connor?

30:04.621 --> 30:09.456
Fine. I'll give him a call, tell him
we didn't think he was the right fit.

30:11.695 --> 30:13.162
I'll talk.

30:18.402 --> 30:20.927
Hi, Daniel Meade for Connor Owens.

30:21.438 --> 30:25.397
Connor? Daniel Meade here.
I'm sitting with Wilhelmina Slater.

30:25.976 --> 30:29.706
So how'd you like to come run
the business side of Meade?

30:30.146 --> 30:31.204
Mmm.

30:31.247 --> 30:34.808
You'll have the offer in writing
tomorrow morning. Yep.

30:38.020 --> 30:39.510
You're right.

30:40.856 --> 30:42.289
We need him.

30:42.925 --> 30:44.620
Well, thank you, Daniel,

30:44.660 --> 30:48.960
for putting your ego aside
and respecting me on this.

30:55.404 --> 30:57.838
This is albacore, okay?
I don't eat albacore.

30:57.873 --> 31:00.034
Now, go back to Nobu
and get me what I ordered!

31:00.075 --> 31:03.602
Hey, Kimmie! I was just wondering
if you needed me to do anything,

31:03.646 --> 31:06.376
- you know, help out.
- No. I'm good.

31:06.415 --> 31:08.678
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

31:08.716 --> 31:11.048
You know, Wilhelmina's gonna be here
any second.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.211
So? Big deal.

31:12.287 --> 31:15.552
Well, not for you because you're
so good at standing up for yourself.

31:15.590 --> 31:19.185
But I'm not. I mean, Wilhelmina
always has such strong opinions,

31:19.227 --> 31:21.195
and I always back down.

31:21.229 --> 31:24.392
- Well, I'm sure she likes that.
- No, no, she hates it.

31:24.432 --> 31:27.833
She only respects people
who stand up to her.

31:27.869 --> 31:29.097
- Really?
- Yeah.

31:29.137 --> 31:31.401
I mean, she's gonna walk in here,
ask to change 10 things,

31:31.439 --> 31:33.964
but what she really wants
is for someone to say no.

31:34.008 --> 31:35.771
I always say yes.

31:36.878 --> 31:38.903
I just wish I wasn't so weak.

31:38.947 --> 31:43.350
The only way to impress Wilhelmina
is to be strong. Oh, well.

31:57.664 --> 32:01.896
<i>If anybody wanted to know</i>

32:01.935 --> 32:04.631
<i>How to party and get on the floor</i>

32:04.671 --> 32:07.697
- Well, you made it happen, Betty.
- Yeah, I did.

32:07.741 --> 32:10.767
I'm proud of you. You found a way
to make it work with Kimmie.

32:10.811 --> 32:11.835
Oh, uh...

32:13.180 --> 32:14.943
Yep. I did.

32:14.982 --> 32:18.042
This business is tough.
It really makes you wonder,

32:18.118 --> 32:22.145
"What kind of person am I?
What am I willing to do to get ahead?"

32:22.222 --> 32:23.712
It's not easy.

32:25.025 --> 32:27.289
So how's everything going?

32:27.394 --> 32:28.656
Um...

32:29.362 --> 32:30.886
Excuse me.

32:36.269 --> 32:37.930
Kimmie,
I have to talk to you right away.

32:37.970 --> 32:39.369
Bad time. Adriana's due any minute.

32:39.405 --> 32:41.600
No, look, I may have steered you
in the wrong direction.

32:41.641 --> 32:44.371
Hey, Betty. What are you doing?
Stop this!

32:44.410 --> 32:47.436
Guys, I can't do it, okay?
This isn't how I want to get ahead.

32:47.480 --> 32:50.608
We have to distract her.
Does anyone have a 6-foot hoagie?

32:50.683 --> 32:51.707
No.

32:52.852 --> 32:54.319
All right, so I set you up.

32:54.387 --> 32:56.014
Wilhelmina hates it
when people disagree with her.

32:56.088 --> 32:57.749
So whatever she says, just do it.

32:57.790 --> 33:00.190
What, just back down and look weak?

33:00.259 --> 33:03.490
No, thanks.
Unlike you, Betty, I intend to go places.

33:03.529 --> 33:04.962
No, but that's what she wants!

33:04.997 --> 33:07.397
She wants you to be weak.
She wants everybody to be weak.

33:07.433 --> 33:08.661
You're so transparent.

33:08.701 --> 33:10.497
No, I am being honest.

33:10.535 --> 33:13.436
Look, she really, really wants
that necklace in the shoot.

33:13.471 --> 33:16.838
- So just put it back. Necklace!
- Unbelievable.

33:16.875 --> 33:19.911
Now you're trying to set me up to put
that ugly necklace back on the model.

33:19.946 --> 33:23.403
No, I was setting you up before.
I am not now. I swear.

33:23.448 --> 33:25.177
Look, Betty,
I know how to judge character,

33:25.250 --> 33:27.912
and right now you're oozing petty,
bitter, jealous ooze.

33:27.986 --> 33:30.887
It's all over you. I see right through
your stupid little plan.

33:30.922 --> 33:33.755
- Kimmie.
- So where's the necklace?

33:35.226 --> 33:38.195
- It's not going to be in the shoot.
- But I want it in this shoot.

33:38.229 --> 33:40.697
Yeah, but it's hideous,
so we're not using it.

33:40.732 --> 33:45.260
Now don't worry, babe. I got it covered.
Just sit back, relax, have a donut.

33:45.303 --> 33:48.136
Do you have
some kind of death wish?

33:48.173 --> 33:50.835
My only wish right now
is that you scooty, scoot, scoot.

33:50.875 --> 33:53.468
Go on. Find someplace shady.

33:53.510 --> 33:56.104
Get the damn necklace
and put it in the damn picture.

33:56.146 --> 33:58.410
- Here.
- It's not going to be in the picture.

33:58.482 --> 34:01.110
That's my decision, and that's final.

34:01.185 --> 34:04.382
- Well, you're fired.
- No, I'm not fired!

34:04.421 --> 34:06.412
Yes, you are fired.

34:06.490 --> 34:08.081
But... But...

34:11.161 --> 34:14.426
Wait a minute. They tricked me!
That's not fair!

34:14.465 --> 34:17.797
I worked too hard to get here.
This is my jumping-off point.

34:17.835 --> 34:20.871
What about my blog, my vlog,
my perfume, my fashion line?

34:20.906 --> 34:23.362
Security, come get her, please!

34:23.407 --> 34:28.174
No. This is not how it's going down.
No Kimmie, no shoot. How about that?

34:28.212 --> 34:29.270
Excuse me?

34:29.313 --> 34:32.594
Have fun doing a tico berry shoot
with no tico berries!

34:32.629 --> 34:35.875
No! No, Kimmie! Don't! Please don't!
That's all we have!

34:40.422 --> 34:41.447
Ha!

34:43.760 --> 34:46.489
- What are you doing? Get off of me!
- This way, miss. Come on.

34:46.529 --> 34:49.760
Screw all of you!
You haven't seen the last of me!

34:54.737 --> 34:57.331
- What...
Adriana Lima's arriving!

34:59.876 --> 35:03.539
I'm here, ready to go.
Where are my tico berries?

35:05.615 --> 35:06.775
Betty?

35:18.760 --> 35:21.354
- Too late for a haircut?
- No! No, no, no, not at all.

35:21.396 --> 35:22.920
Come on in. Have a seat.

35:22.964 --> 35:26.798
I saw one of your flyers over at
the voting, and I thought I'd pop on in.

35:26.835 --> 35:30.202
- Great. How do you like it?
- Just clean it up a little bit.

35:30.238 --> 35:33.503
I have this work thing later,
and I want to look, you know, sharp.

35:33.542 --> 35:34.839
No problem.

35:34.876 --> 35:38.039
I had no idea this little salon was right
here in the neighborhood. I love it.

35:38.113 --> 35:39.137
It's great for the community.

35:39.214 --> 35:41.682
Yeah, but we don't get
a lot of foot traffic, you know.

35:41.717 --> 35:43.742
It's not like this is a business district.

35:43.819 --> 35:45.548
You have a hard time
getting a business license?

35:45.587 --> 35:49.284
No, I didn't get one.
What's the big deal, right?

35:49.324 --> 35:52.418
Well, they could hit you with
a pretty big fine, shut you down.

35:52.461 --> 35:54.894
Yeah,
but who's gonna say anything?

35:54.929 --> 35:55.987
Maybe no one,

35:56.030 --> 35:59.522
but it's always better to be safe
with these things. Trust me.

35:59.633 --> 36:01.999
I'm a councilman in this district.

36:04.004 --> 36:05.699
So are you here to bust me?

36:05.740 --> 36:09.198
No, actually I just
really needed a haircut.

36:09.243 --> 36:10.972
Well, now you're not getting one.

36:11.045 --> 36:14.572
- I'm just telling you the law. It's my job.
- Get out! Get out!

36:14.648 --> 36:17.139
But you only finished half my hair.

36:19.420 --> 36:23.254
All right.
Look, why don't you take my card?

36:23.290 --> 36:25.815
And I promise,
I'll do anything I can to help you,

36:25.860 --> 36:29.193
but I strongly suggest you shut down
temporarily until you get that license.

36:29.230 --> 36:31.892
- "Archie Rodriguez. "
- That's me.

36:31.932 --> 36:35.992
Well, Archie Rodriguez,
I have six weeks of bookings,

36:36.035 --> 36:38.663
and now you're telling me
that I can't run my own salon?

36:38.705 --> 36:42.641
What can I say?
Next time, you can vote me out.

36:54.587 --> 36:56.452
Betty, do something.
Are there any more berries?

36:56.489 --> 36:58.252
They weren't very easy to find.

36:58.291 --> 37:00.589
Well, Adriana's not doing the shoot
without those berries.

37:00.627 --> 37:04.427
If this falls apart, it's a major fiasco.
The press will kill us.

37:04.464 --> 37:07.524
Hello! I am waiting
for my beautiful berries!

37:07.567 --> 37:10.603
They'll be here in a minute, Adriana.

37:10.638 --> 37:11.763
We can't bluff for too long.

37:11.805 --> 37:15.502
You know what they say about models,
but this one is a smart one.

37:15.542 --> 37:18.806
<i>Done. Anybody have
the Sunday Times crossword?</i>

37:20.012 --> 37:21.104
We have a lot riding on this.

37:21.180 --> 37:22.647
Are you sure
you don't want me to take over?

37:22.714 --> 37:25.114
No. No.

37:29.755 --> 37:31.882
I just remembered something.

37:33.992 --> 37:36.722
- Adriana? Hi.
- Hi.

37:36.762 --> 37:40.323
<i>- I'm Betty Suarez. I work at Mode.
- Nice to meet you.</i>

37:40.365 --> 37:41.559
Uh...

37:41.600 --> 37:45.536
Adriana, did you get that fruit basket
we put in your room?

37:45.571 --> 37:49.564
Yes, I did. It was wonderful.
Thank you so much.

37:49.608 --> 37:51.838
Oh, good.

37:51.910 --> 37:54.378
See, 'cause I know
I put some tico berries in there,

37:54.446 --> 37:57.812
and it would be great
if you didn't eat all of them,

37:57.849 --> 38:02.650
because, you see, we don't have
any tico berries for the shoot.

38:02.687 --> 38:06.214
I don't understand. This whole shoot
was inspired by the berries.

38:06.257 --> 38:08.782
I know. I know, and we had them.

38:08.826 --> 38:12.353
It's just... There was an incident,
and now we don't.

38:12.396 --> 38:14.830
And it's not like
it's exactly easy to come by them.

38:14.866 --> 38:17.096
I mean, this isn't Todos os Santos Bay.

38:17.134 --> 38:18.260
How do you know that?

38:18.302 --> 38:20.634
Well, it's where
your grandfather's farm is, right?

38:20.671 --> 38:22.901
- Yes.
- I did the research.

38:23.741 --> 38:26.335
Kimmie told me she did all the work.

38:26.410 --> 38:27.843
Yeah.

38:27.879 --> 38:31.315
Okay, I get it. She's that type of girl.

38:32.183 --> 38:37.177
Well, it's not exactly like my way's
any better. We don't have the berries.

38:37.221 --> 38:39.984
So did you eat all of them?

38:58.141 --> 38:59.870
I gotta say,
you really pulled it off, Betty.

38:59.943 --> 39:03.276
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, Daniel.

39:03.313 --> 39:05.747
And I owe you an apology
about Kimmie.

39:05.782 --> 39:07.409
She was a bad seed. I didn't see it.

39:07.450 --> 39:09.213
Oh, well. You were right.

39:09.252 --> 39:11.812
The thing that's important
is how I do my job.

39:12.188 --> 39:14.656
Oh, uh, speaking of the business,

39:15.725 --> 39:18.057
I got you something
I thought you might be able to use.

39:18.094 --> 39:20.084
- What...
- Hello, Daniel.

39:21.030 --> 39:22.258
Connor.

39:23.899 --> 39:25.594
This is my assistant, Betty Suarez.

39:25.634 --> 39:27.363
Betty Suarez, hi.

39:27.403 --> 39:29.337
You're Connor Owens, my God,

39:29.371 --> 39:31.635
you're, like,
famous in the publishing world.

39:31.707 --> 39:34.335
And you've got a good handshake,
firm, strong, big hands,

39:34.410 --> 39:37.208
really big,
like tennis rackets with fingers.

39:37.246 --> 39:38.975
- Betty?
- Sorry.

39:39.014 --> 39:40.641
It's nice to meet you.

39:40.683 --> 39:42.810
So did that offer come in?

39:42.851 --> 39:46.184
Yes, it did,
and I'd like to talk about it with you.

39:46.221 --> 39:48.781
Betty, would you excuse us
for a second?

40:02.971 --> 40:03.960
We did it.

40:04.038 --> 40:05.665
So now it's real.

40:06.808 --> 40:08.742
That was smooth.

40:08.776 --> 40:11.677
And Wilhelmina has no idea.

40:20.555 --> 40:22.989
Looks like somebody had a good day.

40:23.024 --> 40:25.720
Yes, today was a good day.

40:25.760 --> 40:27.489
What you holding onto so tight?

40:27.528 --> 40:31.897
Nothing, just something my boss
gave me for doing a photo shoot.

40:31.933 --> 40:33.696
So you got your chance.

40:35.236 --> 40:40.333
Yeah, mainly because
you told me to go for it.

40:40.408 --> 40:43.137
Well, I was just telling you
what I tell myself.

40:43.176 --> 40:45.644
Well, it worked, so, thank you.

40:46.446 --> 40:49.006
Sure. So let me see what you got.

40:51.051 --> 40:52.712
- Business cards.
- Whoa.

40:52.753 --> 40:56.189
They don't have a title yet,
but I'll get there.

40:56.590 --> 40:59.150
And you can keep that one.
I have plenty.

40:59.192 --> 41:01.285
That's really cool, Betty.

41:02.062 --> 41:03.256
Thanks.

41:03.363 --> 41:05.354
<i>I had a dream last night</i>

41:05.465 --> 41:09.367
<i>I had a reason to stay
in the back of my head</i>

41:09.403 --> 41:11.894
<i>Still, I have to say goodbye</i>

41:11.938 --> 41:14.805
<i>Here, in this bed, free</i>

41:15.308 --> 41:17.833
<i>You are free</i>
