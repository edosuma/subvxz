FREEMAN:
Captain's log,
stardate 58130.6.

00:08.755 --> 00:11.715
TheCerritos has rendezvoused
with theArchimedes

00:11.758 --> 00:14.718
and my old friend
Captain Sonya Gomez

00:14.761 --> 00:18.069
so that we can assist in her
first contact of the Lapeerians.

00:18.113 --> 00:19.853
ADMIRAL FREEMAN:
The Laap System is
fairly unassuming:

00:19.897 --> 00:21.942
a gas giant,
couple Class Js,

00:21.986 --> 00:23.379
obviously our new Class M,

00:23.422 --> 00:25.685
and an unstable planetoid
right here,

00:25.729 --> 00:27.513
just off its ecliptic.

00:27.557 --> 00:29.646
The Cerritoswill be positioned
outside the system.

00:29.689 --> 00:32.518
Isn't that overly cautious
for a planetoid?

00:32.562 --> 00:34.781
Carol, I know
Cali-class isn't afraid

00:34.825 --> 00:36.522
of getting their nacelles dirty.

00:36.566 --> 00:38.655
We just don't want multiple
ships approaching at once,

00:38.698 --> 00:40.874
or the Lapeerians
might mistake "first contact"

00:40.918 --> 00:42.963
-for a "first invasion."
-Of course.

00:43.007 --> 00:44.617
Once formalities are complete,

00:44.661 --> 00:46.576
the Cerritoscan install
subspace transponders

00:46.619 --> 00:48.621
and join us for a celebration
with the locals.

00:48.665 --> 00:51.668
[chuckles] I'll tell sickbay
to brace for hangovers.

00:51.711 --> 00:53.278
One more thing,
Captain Freeman.

00:53.322 --> 00:57.239
I've heard that
congratulations are in order.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.111
[glass clinking]

01:01.547 --> 01:03.158
Oh, great. Jennifer.

01:03.201 --> 01:05.247
I'm sure you just love
catching me with contraband,

01:05.290 --> 01:07.510
but can you try not to rat me
out to Ransom this time, okay?

01:07.553 --> 01:08.641
Yeah, I don't care.

01:08.685 --> 01:10.078
Oh, please, I know you hate me.

01:10.121 --> 01:12.254
Pfft, I don't think
about you at all.

01:12.297 --> 01:13.777
[under breath]: Yeah, right,
I bet you dream about me

01:13.820 --> 01:15.953
every night with your
stupid little butt--

01:15.996 --> 01:17.302
Whoa.

01:17.346 --> 01:18.825
Enjoy your final mission
on the Cerritos.

01:18.869 --> 01:20.958
New ships are exciting,
but trust me:

01:21.001 --> 01:22.133
you'll miss your crew.

01:22.177 --> 01:23.656
You don't think the admiralty

01:23.700 --> 01:25.484
will let me transfer
my senior staff?

01:25.528 --> 01:27.138
With California-class?

01:27.182 --> 01:29.836
Command likes to keep
a real sense of consistency.

01:29.880 --> 01:32.970
You're gonna have to make
some tearful goodbyes.

We could end up with some weirdo

Yeah, but this is huge

03:26.388 --> 03:27.998
then we get to line up
in the hallway, right?

03:28.041 --> 03:29.782
And then we all applaud

03:29.826 --> 03:32.176
while the captain walks off
the ship for the last time.

03:32.220 --> 03:33.569
Ooh, that sounds great!

03:38.313 --> 03:39.836
You think Ransom might be
willing to move it up?

03:39.879 --> 03:41.272
It is a vanity holiday

03:41.316 --> 03:42.752
to trick kids
into respecting authority,

03:42.795 --> 03:44.232
plus she hasn't even
told Ransom...

03:44.275 --> 03:45.842
And he'd probably
be super pissed.

Ugh, well, I mean,

there's just so much

Come on. Dr. T's grouchy,

That you're being offered
a promotion to a new ship,

I'll remain at your side,

-So you are leaving?

06:05.590 --> 06:07.331
Why didn't you tell us?

06:07.375 --> 06:09.855
You're lucky I'm so spiritually
centered or I'd snap!

06:09.899 --> 06:11.379
It's not official.

06:11.422 --> 06:13.511
Why the hell wouldn't you take

18:41.737 --> 18:43.826
and make sure your mom
doesn't get us all killed!

18:43.869 --> 18:45.088
You guys are right.

18:45.132 --> 18:46.263
[exhales] You got this, Boims?

18:46.307 --> 18:47.612
Yes! Go!

18:47.656 --> 18:49.440
Thanks, okay!
Sorry, sorry, sorry!

18:49.484 --> 18:51.486
RUTHERFORD:
Okay, so you just gotta go
all the way down

18:51.529 --> 18:52.878
and then swim the length
of the hydrotube

18:52.922 --> 18:54.445
and then wedge
into the filter nodule

18:54.489 --> 18:55.925
to reach the clamps. Cool?

18:55.968 --> 18:58.057
Oh. Oh, wow,
that's a really long tunnel.

18:58.101 --> 19:00.190
-Uh, I'm not sure...
-Boimler, you're the one

19:00.234 --> 19:01.365
who wants to dive
into the unknown.

19:01.409 --> 19:02.497
Now's your chance.

19:02.540 --> 19:03.933
So, get diving!

19:05.456 --> 19:07.284
[grunting]

19:07.328 --> 19:08.677
[exhales]

19:11.027 --> 19:14.465
So, you guys doing anything
for Captain Freeman Day?

19:21.777 --> 19:23.300
[grunting]

19:29.959 --> 19:31.743
[breathing heavily]

19:41.362 --> 19:42.798
Approaching debris field,
Captain.

19:42.841 --> 19:45.496
Mom, I was being a jerk,
I'm sorry.

19:45.540 --> 19:47.585
I don't know why I turn
everything into a fight.

19:47.629 --> 19:49.761
I think it's because one time
after the Academy I was in...

19:49.805 --> 19:51.372
No time for emotional bids,
Ensign.

19:51.415 --> 19:53.461
Also, I was being a jerk too,

19:53.504 --> 19:54.636
-and I love you.
-Aw!

19:54.679 --> 19:55.680
Now post up.

19:55.724 --> 19:57.421
We need all the help we can get.

19:57.465 --> 19:58.466
Prepare to cut power.

19:58.509 --> 19:59.815
That panel is still up.

19:59.858 --> 20:01.208
Boimler's got it.
Just give him time.

20:01.251 --> 20:02.600
We don't have time.

20:02.644 --> 20:04.341
[straining]

20:04.385 --> 20:06.038
Come on, come on...

20:09.868 --> 20:11.609
Got it!

20:13.176 --> 20:14.264
Panel's free!

20:14.308 --> 20:15.961
Cut power!

20:18.094 --> 20:19.095
[exhales]

20:19.138 --> 20:20.618
Ah! Ah! No, no, no!

20:20.662 --> 20:22.185
No, no, no, no, no! [inhales]

20:42.205 --> 20:45.034
Big chunk, starboard,
roughly 55.18 degrees.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.384
And another at 38.20!

20:47.428 --> 20:49.386
Got it. Hang on to something.

20:54.478 --> 20:56.437
He should have
come up already.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.960
Boimler!

20:59.353 --> 21:00.441
He's in arrest!

21:00.484 --> 21:01.790
We have to get him to sickbay!

21:01.833 --> 21:03.008
There's no time!

21:07.752 --> 21:08.884
[grunts]

21:08.927 --> 21:10.581
[grunting]

21:10.625 --> 21:12.888
Incoming! Direct ahead!

21:12.931 --> 21:15.282
I can't avoid it!
Brace for impact!

21:18.415 --> 21:20.112
[yells]

21:21.157 --> 21:22.637
-Mom!
-Beckett!

21:22.680 --> 21:24.378
Whoa!

21:24.421 --> 21:27.250
TENDI:
Okay, come on, Boimler. Come on.

21:27.294 --> 21:28.643
Come on,
you're going to make it.

21:28.686 --> 21:30.775
-[coughing]
-Boimler! Talk to me.

21:30.819 --> 21:33.125
Did... did I miss
Captain Freeman Day?

21:33.169 --> 21:35.432
Yes! He's gonna be okay!

21:37.695 --> 21:39.175
I saw a koala...

21:39.218 --> 21:40.785
Uh, yeah, you know,
it's probably best

21:40.829 --> 21:42.352
you just keep that to yourself.

21:42.396 --> 21:44.311
[whimpering]

21:49.098 --> 21:50.665
No!

21:52.101 --> 21:54.712
[panting]

21:54.756 --> 21:55.974
Gotcha.

21:58.673 --> 22:00.022
[grunts]

22:06.202 --> 22:09.466
Five minutes until
we hit atmosphere, Captain.

22:09.510 --> 22:11.642
Everyone, if you move
to the back of the ship,

22:11.686 --> 22:12.948
there's a chance you'll survive.

22:12.991 --> 22:14.950
Sonya, no.
We are staying with you.

22:14.993 --> 22:16.604
It has been an honor.

22:17.605 --> 22:19.476
[grunting]

22:37.799 --> 22:39.453
Wait, what's happening?

22:39.496 --> 22:40.932
It's the Cerritos!

22:44.980 --> 22:47.548
[cheering]

22:49.593 --> 22:51.987
The Archimedesis
in stable orbit, Captain.

22:52.030 --> 22:53.249
No lives lost.

22:53.292 --> 22:54.859
Oh...

23:00.038 --> 23:02.040
[indistinct chatter]

23:06.393 --> 23:08.003
Hey, I'm proud of you, Mom.

23:08.046 --> 23:10.005
You saved the day,
kept it together...

23:10.048 --> 23:12.137
I guess I understand
why Command was so impressed.

23:12.181 --> 23:13.356
Thank you.

23:13.400 --> 23:14.836
But I'm a little nervous.

23:16.838 --> 23:18.317
How do I look?

23:18.361 --> 23:20.319
Like a badass captain
who knows what's up.

23:21.625 --> 23:23.627
On behalf of the United
Federation of Planets,

23:23.671 --> 23:25.412
allow me to introduce myself.

23:25.455 --> 23:27.109
I am Captain Carol Freeman,

23:27.152 --> 23:28.763
of the starship Cerritos,

23:28.806 --> 23:30.155
and I come in...

23:30.199 --> 23:31.461
-[laughs]
-Whoa!

23:31.505 --> 23:32.723
Lapeeria welcomes you!

23:32.767 --> 23:34.290
We must drink!

23:34.333 --> 23:36.640
[cheering]

23:49.348 --> 23:51.786
Every time I think
I'm out of this thing,

23:51.829 --> 23:53.614
boom, hit by an asteroid.

23:53.657 --> 23:55.659
Well, don't worry. I'm sure
you're the doc's top priority.

23:55.703 --> 23:57.444
Ensign Tendi, get over here.

23:59.358 --> 24:00.969
Listen, I-I know what
you're going to say,

24:01.012 --> 24:03.145
and I'm so sorry
for letting you down.

24:03.188 --> 24:04.929
I-I know
I don't belong in sickbay.

24:04.973 --> 24:05.974
You're right, you don't.

24:06.017 --> 24:07.628
-[sobs]
-You master

24:07.671 --> 24:09.194
everything
you put your mind to.

24:09.238 --> 24:10.239
It's unsettling.

24:10.282 --> 24:11.936
Oh, uh, thank you?

24:11.980 --> 24:13.808
You shouldn't be treating
phaser burns.

24:13.851 --> 24:16.506
I'm moving you into
senior science officer training.

24:16.550 --> 24:18.377
Wait, like, to work
on the bridge?

24:18.421 --> 24:20.162
Like Jadzia Dax?

24:20.205 --> 24:21.511
Who the [bleep] is that?
I don't know who that is.

24:21.555 --> 24:23.034
No, like Spock.

24:23.078 --> 24:24.862
It means a lot more experiments,
away missions--

24:24.906 --> 24:25.994
think you can handle it?

24:26.037 --> 24:28.083
-Thank you so much!
-[yowls]

24:28.126 --> 24:30.128
I'm okay with this.

24:30.172 --> 24:31.434
[purring]

24:34.219 --> 24:35.873
Ha! Rutherford!

24:35.917 --> 24:37.092
I get to stay on the ship!

24:37.135 --> 24:38.659
And Dr. T'Ana hugged me!

24:38.702 --> 24:40.791
You do? She did?

24:40.835 --> 24:42.053
Hey!

24:42.097 --> 24:43.968
Happy first first contact,
Cap.

24:44.012 --> 24:45.492
[slurring]:
Oh, thank you, Jack.

24:45.535 --> 24:46.928
It was great.

24:46.971 --> 24:48.886
Are you--
Have you been drinking?

24:48.930 --> 24:51.628
They're a very welcoming
culture.

24:51.672 --> 24:53.717
Repairs on the Archimedesare
going smoothly.

24:53.761 --> 24:55.719
Captain Gomez
is recovering nicely.

24:55.763 --> 24:58.722
It was kind of her
to let me finish the mission.

24:58.766 --> 25:00.724
No ego on that one.

25:00.768 --> 25:02.334
-Hey.
-Hey.

25:02.378 --> 25:04.249
Thanks for doing
a super dangerous space walk

25:04.293 --> 25:06.948
to save my life.
That was pretty cool.

25:06.991 --> 25:09.080
No worries.
Cerritosstrong, right?

25:09.124 --> 25:10.865
Totally.

25:10.908 --> 25:12.780
Sorry I've been a jerk all year.

25:12.823 --> 25:14.346
I kind of thought you hated me.

25:14.390 --> 25:16.827
Yeah, you know,
I think when I like people,

25:16.871 --> 25:18.307
I maybe go out of my way

25:18.350 --> 25:20.135
to force some distance,
so that's on me.

25:20.178 --> 25:22.529
So what I'm taking away
from that was that you like me?

25:22.572 --> 25:24.531
No. Shut up, come on.

25:24.574 --> 25:27.577
Congrats, Brad.
You were a real hero today.

25:27.621 --> 25:30.145
Thanks, but anyone would have
done the same.

25:30.188 --> 25:31.755
Whoa, check out
Mr. Humble Confidence.

25:31.799 --> 25:33.322
Where'd you come from?

25:33.365 --> 25:35.193
I guess when you almost
drown in whale pee,

25:35.237 --> 25:37.587
it makes you not sweat the
small stuff anymore, you know?

25:37.631 --> 25:39.415
Oh, Mom noticed the decorations,
by the way.

25:39.458 --> 25:41.330
What?
D-D-Did she know it was me?

25:41.373 --> 25:43.985
Mm, she probably assumes
it was children, actually.

25:44.028 --> 25:46.204
[gasps] Cap'n! Cap'n!
I drew the banners!

25:46.248 --> 25:47.554
Huh. I like that guy.

25:47.597 --> 25:48.903
Right? He's great.

25:48.946 --> 25:50.078
To the Captain!

25:50.121 --> 25:52.428
No, no, no. To the Cerritos!

25:52.471 --> 25:54.996
-[cheering]
-RUTHERFORD: The Cerritos,
I love you!

25:55.039 --> 25:57.085
OFFICER: Captain,
a team from Starfleet Command

25:57.128 --> 25:58.565
is requesting to come aboard.

25:58.608 --> 26:00.958
[exhales] That was fast.
Permission granted.

26:01.002 --> 26:03.091
Escort them to
the senior conference room.

26:03.134 --> 26:04.658
If they were impressed
with you before...

26:04.701 --> 26:07.182
Whew! Today must have
sealed the deal.

26:07.225 --> 26:09.053
Hey, nobody deserves the
recognition more than you, Mom.

26:09.097 --> 26:10.620
Nothing would make us prouder

26:10.664 --> 26:12.361
than seeing you move up
to bigger and better.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.711
Maybe bigger, but never better.

26:14.755 --> 26:16.757
I'm turning down the transfer.

26:16.800 --> 26:18.106
-What?
-But Captain,

26:18.149 --> 26:19.411
you've been working
so hard for this.

26:19.455 --> 26:21.370
Yeah, well,
maybe a little too hard.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.459
It blinded me
to what I already have

26:23.502 --> 26:25.243
right here on the Cerritos.

26:25.287 --> 26:26.810
What good would a new ship be

26:26.854 --> 26:28.682
without the best crew
in the fleet?

26:28.725 --> 26:30.422
Mom! No way!

26:30.466 --> 26:32.990
Come on, let's go tell them
they wasted their trip.

26:33.034 --> 26:34.557
BOIMLER:
Cap'n! Cap'n!
I drew the banners!

26:34.601 --> 26:36.037
It was Boimler! It was Boimler!

26:38.343 --> 26:40.650
Captain Freeman.
I'm Commander Mandel.

26:40.694 --> 26:42.826
Under the authority of
Starfleet Command, you...

26:42.870 --> 26:45.046
I have to stop you right there,
Commander.

26:45.089 --> 26:46.961
I'm not leaving the Cerritos.

26:47.004 --> 26:48.571
I'm afraid
you don't have a choice.

26:48.615 --> 26:50.704
[laughs] I'm turning down
the promotion.

26:50.747 --> 26:52.531
Look, she might not seem
like much to you,

26:52.575 --> 26:54.751
but this ship is my home.

26:54.795 --> 26:58.929
You're under arrest for the
destruction of Pakled Planet.

26:58.973 --> 27:00.888
What? Wh-- What are you
talking about?

27:00.931 --> 27:02.237
Hey! Let-let her go!

27:02.280 --> 27:03.325
This is madness!

27:03.368 --> 27:04.674
Captain! What are your orders?

27:04.718 --> 27:06.458
Stand down!
What are the charges?

27:06.502 --> 27:08.939
We have proof that you colluded
with Klingon extremists

27:08.983 --> 27:12.116
to plant a Varuvian bomb
in the Pakled capital city.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.031
My God, when did this happen?

27:14.075 --> 27:16.773
Today, 0900, while you were
conveniently on a mission...

27:16.817 --> 27:18.688
I'm sure just as planned.

27:18.732 --> 27:20.516
She had nothing to do with this!

27:20.559 --> 27:22.779
-That is for a tribunal
to decide.
-I'll kill you!

27:22.823 --> 27:24.694
Stop. Let them do their job.

27:24.738 --> 27:25.782
-But Mom...
-Captain...

27:25.826 --> 27:26.870
That's an order.

27:26.914 --> 27:28.176
We have the truth on our side.

27:28.219 --> 27:29.699
And I don't want
the crew finding out

27:29.743 --> 27:31.396
until we know more.

27:31.440 --> 27:33.137
Congratulations, Captain!
