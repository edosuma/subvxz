WEBVTT

00:07.002 --> 00:11.167
So, Norm, any luck impregnating Vera?

00:13.094 --> 00:16.216
l miss the old days
when people asked me things like,

00:16.392 --> 00:19.512
''How are those Red Sox doing?''
Things like that.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.014
Well, excuse me for caring.

00:23.485 --> 00:27.566
l'm sorry, Larry, l'm just a little edgy.

00:27.740 --> 00:31.740
You have to understand
l've gone an entire month with sex.

00:32.914 --> 00:36.666
Normie, Larry understands.
Don't you, Larry?

00:36.838 --> 00:41.714
But you've been trying for a few weeks
now and you've yet to strike paydirt.

00:41.885 --> 00:44.213
Can l ask you a personal question?

00:44.391 --> 00:47.974
Heaven forbid this conversation
get personal now.

00:48.146 --> 00:51.397
Have you been to a fertility specialist?

00:51.567 --> 00:55.318
Yeah, we have,
but l don't have a lot of faith in this guy.

00:55.489 --> 01:01.743
He's got Vera sprinkling powdered
rhinoceros horn on my morning cereal.

01:01.914 --> 01:04.787
Does it make you feel more virile,
Normie?

01:04.962 --> 01:09.626
Not really, but every now and then
l get this urge to charge a jeep.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074

02:27.707 --> 02:30.494
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

02:31.836 --> 02:34.376
What would you say to a beer, Normie?

02:34.550 --> 02:36.709
Daddy wuvs you.

02:39.515 --> 02:42.138
- lt's freezing.
- Didn't you hear?

02:42.310 --> 02:45.479
We've given our appliances
the winter off.

02:45.649 --> 02:48.021
There's a blockage in the heating.

02:48.194 --> 02:51.445
The furnace is working,
but we're not getting hot air.

02:51.614 --> 02:55.781
- What's Sammy going to do?
- l cannot believe this helplessness.

02:55.955 --> 02:58.577
How about a little Yankee ingenuity?

02:58.750 --> 03:02.335
lf Cheers were burning,
would you wait for Sam to get back?

03:02.506 --> 03:05.923
No, Diane,
cos l already taught them the fire drill.

03:06.094 --> 03:10.842
We all file out in an orderly fashion
after nailing your hair to the bar.

03:18.153 --> 03:20.646
We don't usually see you this early.

03:20.825 --> 03:26.830
l'm sick, Diane.
l must be coming down with something.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.538
Thought l'd get some coffee here
before l finish my route.

03:30.715 --> 03:35.260
- No, Cliff, let me get you a nice brandy.
- No, Coach, l hope l'm never that ill.

03:35.429 --> 03:39.095
That's one thing
that'll never touch these lips.

03:39.267 --> 03:41.892
There's something that wants to?

03:42.981 --> 03:48.227
Alcohol. l'm on duty, Carla.
Just a coffee, please, Coach.

03:48.406 --> 03:50.567
l can do better than that for you.

03:50.744 --> 03:56.036
Will somebody go upstairs to Melville's
and get this man a bowl of hot soup?

03:56.211 --> 03:58.288
What happened to the heat, Coach?

03:58.464 --> 04:03.839
Some minor malfunction that no one
here is skilled enough to attempt to fix.

04:04.013 --> 04:07.346
Diane, l resent that.
l'm kind of a handy guy.

04:07.517 --> 04:11.766
l'll have you know just the other day
l changed one of them...

04:11.941 --> 04:15.192
- What do you call them?
- A light bulb.

04:16.906 --> 04:19.279
Why don't you just call in sick?

04:19.452 --> 04:23.154
l could never do that.
lt's a matter of principle with me.

04:23.331 --> 04:26.620
l've got to be on the verge of death
before l take sick leave.

04:26.795 --> 04:29.003
You used it up to go to Florida.

04:29.174 --> 04:31.547
You got a problem with that?

04:33.013 --> 04:36.847
- Here you go, Cliffie.
- Thank you, Norm.

04:37.019 --> 04:40.934
- How many letters you got left?
- l don't know. Seven or eight.

04:42.859 --> 04:46.396
- Boy, this tastes good.
- These are on my way home.

04:46.574 --> 04:50.108
Let me drop these off for you.
l've got to go home anyway.

04:50.287 --> 04:53.576
No, you're not trained.
You're not qualified.

04:53.751 --> 04:57.537
Qualified? You drop them in a slot.
A chimp could do it.

04:59.093 --> 05:03.043
No way. They did a study
at the University of Michigan.

05:03.224 --> 05:05.300
Chimps were 32% slower.

05:06.395 --> 05:11.022
Yeah, they were better with
customer relations and everything.

05:12.069 --> 05:18.358
Clifford, he is offering to do you a favour
out of friendship for your own good.

05:18.536 --> 05:20.661
Sounds like you have two options.

05:20.832 --> 05:26.955
Either let me deliver these
or run the risk of non-delivery...

05:27.132 --> 05:31.048
- l'll drop these off.
- Thank you, Normie.

05:31.222 --> 05:34.972
ln those envelopes are the
dreams, hopes and fears of a nation.

05:35.145 --> 05:38.313
Yeah, and several
car-wash announcements.

05:45.618 --> 05:50.365
Hey, everybody. Oh, boy! Holy cow!
What happened here?

05:50.541 --> 05:53.912
lt was warmer in the mountains
and we were <i>au natural.</i>

05:54.087 --> 05:59.001
- Coach, did you check the furnace?
- lt's not the furnace. lt's that damn vent.

05:59.179 --> 06:02.882
l called the repairman.
He's on his way over.

06:03.060 --> 06:07.937
Good. Bambi, it's up to you and me
to generate a little heat for these folks.

06:08.108 --> 06:12.820
Don't bother. We'll just huddle around
a three-watt light bulb.

06:14.368 --> 06:17.738
Feisty little barmaid.
l took her in off the streets.

06:17.914 --> 06:20.703
She's crude, but devoted.

06:22.462 --> 06:25.334
l had a terrific time. Thank you.

06:25.507 --> 06:28.797
Thank you, Sam.
lt was the best ski trip l ever had.

06:28.973 --> 06:32.972
- Yeah. Me, too.
- Did you find any time for skiing?

06:33.145 --> 06:36.348
No, darn it. Somebody stole our skis.

06:36.524 --> 06:40.738
We had to spend
the whole weekend in the lodge.

06:40.906 --> 06:43.315
That's too bad.

06:43.493 --> 06:49.000
But when we were leaving, they turned
up in the rack on the roof of Sam's car.

06:50.962 --> 06:55.591
Some kids must have stolen them
for a joy-ski.

06:56.721 --> 06:59.129
Disrespectful punks.

06:59.307 --> 07:02.677
l've got to get going.
l have to be at BU in half an hour.

07:02.854 --> 07:06.306
BU? That's Boston University,
isn't it, Bambi?

07:06.483 --> 07:10.153
- That's right.
- Where the smart types hang out.

07:10.324 --> 07:13.740
- What are you studying?
- l'm not studying.

07:13.912 --> 07:16.913
l'm going to be part of a fraternity stunt.

07:18.127 --> 07:22.375
Yeah, she's tutoring some of the boys.

07:23.469 --> 07:27.715
- ln a way. See you later, Sam.
- You take care.

07:31.897 --> 07:35.147
Well, l guess l better take a look
at this air duct.

07:35.317 --> 07:37.645
Sometimes the problem's over here.

07:37.823 --> 07:39.864
Bambi?

07:40.034 --> 07:42.275
Yeah, what's wrong with that?

07:42.453 --> 07:46.371
Well, l suppose
it's better than Dumbo or Goofy.

07:47.877 --> 07:50.002
Not as appropriate, but...

07:51.550 --> 07:54.670
Coach, can l have my flashlight, please?

07:54.845 --> 07:57.469
You know, Sam...

07:57.641 --> 08:04.443
l can't help but noticing
that Bambi wasn't the same little deer

08:04.611 --> 08:08.029
that you left here with on Friday.

08:08.200 --> 08:11.949
No, l got rid of Cindy.
We weren't compatible.

08:12.121 --> 08:15.621
Really? What was the problem there?

08:15.793 --> 08:18.416
Dumb as a post.

08:18.589 --> 08:23.502
With so much in common,
l can't imagine why you two went awry.

08:24.514 --> 08:27.683
No, l'm serious.
She wasn't my intellectual equal.

08:27.852 --> 08:31.388
You should have said you're
looking for an intellectual equal.

08:31.566 --> 08:36.111
l could introduce you to something
that's growing on my shower curtain.

08:39.077 --> 08:43.457
Thank you, Diane, but l think l'll wait
and see how Bambi works out.

08:43.626 --> 08:47.328
l've done just about everything
l know what to do.

08:48.215 --> 08:50.755
You shined a flashlight on it.

08:50.927 --> 08:53.633
Yeah, it usually works, too.

08:53.807 --> 08:56.299
This one's really got me stumped.

08:58.980 --> 09:02.981
Could somebody go up to Melville's
and get me a little bit more soup?

09:03.155 --> 09:06.772
Larry? You're not doing
anything important there.

09:06.949 --> 09:09.656
- Yeah, all right.
- Good man.

09:10.831 --> 09:13.951
- Thanks a lot.
- l suppose you want some crackers?

09:14.128 --> 09:17.250
Well, those low-sodium kind, all right?

09:17.424 --> 09:21.506
- What's he doing in my office?
- The guy is sick as a dog.

09:21.680 --> 09:23.805
Coach, l'm not so bad now.

09:23.976 --> 09:28.972
l could probably sit up at the bar there
and let Larry bring dinner down to me.

09:30.067 --> 09:34.447
- Cliff Clavin?
- Yeah, Officer. What's the trouble?

09:34.616 --> 09:38.865
- Do you know a Norm Peterson?
- Yeah. What is it?

09:39.037 --> 09:43.370
He's at the station.
We've arrested him for mail theft.

09:43.545 --> 09:46.713
- You made a mistake.
- There's no mistake.

09:46.883 --> 09:50.301
We caught him messing
with mail boxes on your route.

09:50.472 --> 09:54.638
He had a handful of letters.
He said he was delivering them for you.

09:54.812 --> 09:57.139
- l asked him to.
- You asked him to?

09:57.316 --> 09:59.855
Well, you're out of a job, fella.

10:00.027 --> 10:04.525
Excuse me, Officer,
you interrupted me before l finished.

10:04.701 --> 10:06.990
l asked him to quit following me.

10:07.163 --> 10:10.284
l had him pegged
as a sociopath right away.

10:10.459 --> 10:14.958
He's a frustrated mailman.
We call it postal envy.

10:16.802 --> 10:21.050
Anything serious going
to happen to this ne'er-do-well?

10:21.224 --> 10:26.469
- Not serious enough.
- l rue the day they outlawed flogging.

10:26.648 --> 10:28.808
Bleeding hearts.

10:28.986 --> 10:31.195
How well do you know this guy?

10:31.366 --> 10:35.411
We talk every now and then.
He's a portly guy, isn't he?

10:35.579 --> 10:37.619
Full size.

10:37.791 --> 10:40.662
What will happen to this Patterson fella?

10:40.836 --> 10:44.504
- Peterson.
- Officer, l'm the owner of the bar here.

10:44.676 --> 10:47.084
Sam Malone. ls there a problem?

10:47.263 --> 10:52.223
No. Some guy tried to implicate this
letter carrier in a mail theft on his route.

10:52.394 --> 10:55.100
- Crazy.
- You're kidding me. Mail theft?

10:55.273 --> 10:59.274
Ridiculous. l've known Cliff for years.
He wouldn't be involved in that.

10:59.447 --> 11:03.232
You're a fine bartender.
You are one of Boston's finest.

11:03.411 --> 11:06.034
Thanks.
We just had to check out the story.

11:06.208 --> 11:07.915
And check it out you did.

11:08.084 --> 11:12.001
The Federal government appreciates
the cooperation of you local boys.

11:12.174 --> 11:17.881
Let's hope our penal system can
rehabilitate the wretch. Thank you.

11:18.056 --> 11:20.098
Can you believe that?

11:20.269 --> 11:22.678
- Let's shoot some stick.
- Sure.

11:22.856 --> 11:25.894
They arrested a guy on Cliff's route
for mail theft.

11:26.069 --> 11:30.648
- You want eight ball or straight pool?
- Norman was finishing your route.

11:30.825 --> 11:33.234
- Clifford?
- What was that?

11:33.413 --> 11:37.162
You mean they arrested Norm?
You didn't straighten the cop out?

11:37.334 --> 11:41.287
lt's a bit complicated.
Sam, do you want to break?

11:41.466 --> 11:46.177
- Clifford, get back here.
- lsn't it obvious what l did here?

11:46.348 --> 11:48.757
Yeah, it's obvious what you've done.

11:48.936 --> 11:52.139
You've run your best friend Norm
up the river.

11:52.315 --> 11:57.228
We're in trouble here. My job's hanging
by a thread. Norm's in jail anyway.

11:57.405 --> 12:01.986
Just leave him there a little longer while
l figure out what's the best thing to do.

12:02.162 --> 12:06.292
- Norm will be OK.
- Norm isn't at some party, you know?

12:06.460 --> 12:10.792
By now he's probably had all his
valuables taken, been strip-searched,

12:10.969 --> 12:15.881
been deloused and thrown into a dark,
cold cell with a sex-starved pervert.

12:16.058 --> 12:20.352
So? That's how he describes
a typical evening at home.

12:20.522 --> 12:23.312
Hey, come on!

12:31.623 --> 12:36.368
l'm looking for an attorney that
specialises in criminal federal offences.

12:36.545 --> 12:41.790
You're going to be defending the best
friend l have and money is no object.

12:41.970 --> 12:45.223
How much? For one guy?

12:46.185 --> 12:50.434
Stick your writ in your briefs,
you ambulance chaser.

12:51.901 --> 12:57.527
Let's let a young public defender
make a name for himself on this one.

12:57.701 --> 12:59.945
l wish you'd see this through my eyes.

13:00.121 --> 13:02.909
l'd like to see this through your eyes.

13:03.084 --> 13:06.336
Come on, Carla.
Norm's such a sweet, cuddly guy.

13:06.505 --> 13:10.208
The jury will look in his sad eyes.
They won't fry him.

13:10.386 --> 13:14.965
- But my career hangs in the balance.
- l'd like to see you hang in the balance.

13:15.143 --> 13:19.142
l notice a certain recurring theme
in your comments here, Carla.

13:19.316 --> 13:21.357
Norm was doing you a favour.

13:21.528 --> 13:25.398
You don't even know if you are
going to get into trouble, Cliffie.

13:25.575 --> 13:27.984
Will you get off my back?

13:28.162 --> 13:34.168
l'll do the gutsy thing and call the
post office and get Norm out of there.

13:34.337 --> 13:37.589
l'll call them
and tell them it was the O'Hara kid.

13:37.759 --> 13:40.381
He won't mind time in jail,
if you get my drift.

13:40.555 --> 13:43.640
- This isn't a joke.
- Where's your sense of humour?

13:43.811 --> 13:45.849
lf Norm was here, he'd laugh.

13:46.021 --> 13:50.650
lf Norm was here, he'd tear out
your tonsils and feed them to you.

13:50.821 --> 13:55.863
All right, l'll call and see what the penalty
is, but it's got to be anonymous.

13:56.035 --> 13:59.703
OK, everybody in favour of Cliff calling,
raise your hand.

14:01.252 --> 14:05.915
lt's anonymous. Not even an extension.

14:06.091 --> 14:08.335
lt's just what l wanted to hear.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.433
How'd you make out, Sam?

14:14.605 --> 14:19.233
Lousy. They won't let Norm go
unless the post office drops charges.

14:19.404 --> 14:22.986
Cliff's going to have to tell the truth.
l've got to talk to him.

14:23.158 --> 14:25.781
- He's on the phone now.
- Confessing?

14:25.954 --> 14:29.206
No, he's finding out
what would happen if he did.

14:29.376 --> 14:31.618
Meantime, you got other problems.

14:31.795 --> 14:34.502
The furnace guy didn't show up?

14:34.674 --> 14:40.468
No. We decided somebody should
climb into the duct and try to open it.

14:40.641 --> 14:44.226
- Who?
- The skinniest person we could think of.

14:44.397 --> 14:48.231
You're kidding me. Diane agreed
to crawl around in the air duct?

14:48.404 --> 14:52.023
She had to. She'd been shooting
her face off about it all day.

14:52.201 --> 14:55.157
- Where is she?
- l'm beneath you.

14:55.329 --> 14:57.737
l always knew that, but...

14:57.917 --> 15:02.250
My goodness! Well, looky here.

15:02.424 --> 15:05.841
- How about that.
- l'm glad you find this amusing.

15:06.012 --> 15:08.421
What are you doing down there?

15:08.599 --> 15:11.305
Aerobics, you idiot.

15:11.478 --> 15:14.315
Why don't you get out of there,
so l can fix it?

15:14.483 --> 15:18.184
l can't crawl any further and my clothes
are snagged on something.

15:18.363 --> 15:21.152
l can't back up. l'm stuck right here.

15:22.035 --> 15:25.405
OK, egg-toss fans, step right up!

15:26.458 --> 15:30.160
Hit the geek and win a beer.
Three eggs for a nickel.

15:30.339 --> 15:32.712
Sam, aren't you going to step in?

15:32.884 --> 15:36.136
You bet your booties l am.
l only got a dime, give me six.

15:36.306 --> 15:38.134
Sam, please.

15:38.309 --> 15:41.809
Carla, how could you suggest
such a thing? Terrible.

15:41.980 --> 15:45.233
l'll go down in the basement
and see if l can get you out.

15:45.403 --> 15:49.652
Thank you. Sam,
will you put the grate back, please?

15:49.826 --> 15:52.531
Someone almost stepped on my face.

15:52.704 --> 15:55.494
With the cutest little satin pumps.

15:55.667 --> 15:58.920
- Thanks.
- All right?

16:01.842 --> 16:05.629
My supervisor confirmed exactly
what l had suspected all along.

16:05.808 --> 16:08.511
That he hired you as a token weenie.

16:09.646 --> 16:13.147
No, he said a courier who let
somebody else deliver his mail

16:13.319 --> 16:18.113
could face a hearing where he could be
suspended or even relieved from duty.

16:18.284 --> 16:22.283
- What about Norm?
- Norm's got no previous record.

16:22.456 --> 16:26.159
They'll just give him a suspended
sentence and a sharp reprimand.

16:26.338 --> 16:30.122
Cliff, you're wrong.
You know you're wrong.

16:31.135 --> 16:36.131
- You should be ashamed of yourself.
- Coach is right, Clifford.

16:36.310 --> 16:40.939
You don't deserve to have a friend
like Norman if you let him down now.

16:41.109 --> 16:44.478
So either you go in there
and straighten this out or we will.

16:44.655 --> 16:47.991
We're never going to let you
show your face in here again.

16:48.161 --> 16:51.114
All right.

16:51.288 --> 16:55.538
l'll call my supervisor and explain
the whole thing in the morning.

16:55.713 --> 16:58.964
- Now!
- All right. Now.

16:59.134 --> 17:01.804
l'll go explain the whole thing now.

17:01.972 --> 17:05.922
l want you all to know that this is going
to mean the end for me.

17:06.102 --> 17:12.439
Yeah, l'll be a civilian, one of the crowd.

17:13.530 --> 17:16.234
There's a lot of things l'll miss, too.

17:16.409 --> 17:19.199
The free mucilage, the twine.

17:20.330 --> 17:25.375
The open-with-care labels we stick
on our flies at the Christmas party.

17:25.546 --> 17:29.251
The uniform, the respect.
l'm leaving here a mailman.

17:29.471 --> 17:31.511
l'm coming back a nobody.

17:33.309 --> 17:36.644
Diane, l can't get to you.

17:36.814 --> 17:40.516
The opening of the air duct is too small.

17:40.694 --> 17:44.944
Coach, call the furnace man, please,
and tell him it's an emergency.

17:45.118 --> 17:48.238
l already called him again, honey,
this evening.

17:48.413 --> 17:50.822
He said he might not make it at all.

17:51.836 --> 17:56.049
- Sam, do something.
- l know somebody else l can call.

17:56.217 --> 17:58.375
But listen. l mean this.

17:58.552 --> 18:04.180
lf you say the word, l will rip
this floor up to get you out of there.

18:04.353 --> 18:07.854
- Do it, Sam, please.
- That's not the word.

18:10.530 --> 18:13.781
- Swine.
- No, you're getting colder.

18:21.045 --> 18:23.501
Come on, now, sweetheart, open up.

18:24.593 --> 18:27.593
You don't know how long
you're going to be in there.

18:27.763 --> 18:31.132
You've got to stay warm.
There you go!

18:32.436 --> 18:34.477
l'm sorry.

18:34.648 --> 18:40.356
You know, Diane, the important thing
here is just to relax and stay calm.

18:40.531 --> 18:43.154
Just remember, rats sense fear.

18:45.997 --> 18:48.703
Here you go, darling.

18:49.961 --> 18:52.002
How's that?

18:52.173 --> 18:56.802
Sam, l'm not hungry and l'm not cold.
l just want to get out of here.

18:56.971 --> 19:01.220
l know, sweetheart. The guy l called
said he'll be here in a minute.

19:01.394 --> 19:03.472
Say...

19:05.067 --> 19:09.694
Just on the off chance that the guy's
not able to get you out of there,

19:09.864 --> 19:13.780
don't you think you'd feel better
if you declared your love for me now,

19:13.953 --> 19:16.446
while you still had the chance?

19:16.625 --> 19:19.248
You're right, Sam.

19:21.214 --> 19:23.256
What did you say?

19:24.260 --> 19:28.841
Let go!

19:30.854 --> 19:35.018
She said she loves me,
always has, always will.

19:35.193 --> 19:37.981
You're off the clock, sweetheart.

19:38.156 --> 19:40.234
Only a dollar?

19:40.410 --> 19:43.531
No, it's happy hour. lt's only 50 cents.

19:48.460 --> 19:50.789
Pucker up, baby!

19:52.177 --> 19:58.134
Hold it. Go sit down!
How could you do that?

19:58.311 --> 20:02.061
lt's all right, Sammy.
He had all his shots in the army.

20:04.443 --> 20:06.484
Great news, everybody!

20:06.655 --> 20:11.034
Because of my spotless record,
l only received a 30-day suspension.

20:11.204 --> 20:13.874
What about Norm? ls he getting out?

20:14.041 --> 20:17.743
My supervisor already called the cops.
Virtue triumphs again.

20:17.922 --> 20:20.710
Set them up, Sammy, drinks are on me.

20:20.884 --> 20:24.966
l guess l've got to give you credit.
That wasn't an easy thing to do.

20:25.140 --> 20:27.812
What do you suppose is going to happen

20:27.978 --> 20:30.517
when the big guy
walks through that door?

20:30.690 --> 20:35.985
Our attitude should be he's paid his debt
to society. Let him start a new life.

20:36.157 --> 20:39.822
That's not exactly
what Carla had in mind, Cliff.

20:39.994 --> 20:42.239
He's going to be sore at you, Cliffo.

20:42.417 --> 20:46.794
- l suppose he is and perhaps justly so.
- Perhaps?

20:46.963 --> 20:50.963
Underneath that anger is going
to be love and understanding.

20:51.137 --> 20:53.510
We go back a long way, he and l.

20:53.681 --> 20:57.054
When that big fella comes in,
l'm just going to go up to him,

20:57.230 --> 20:59.850
admit my error
and ask for his forgiveness.

21:00.023 --> 21:02.647
- Here comes Norm now.
- Good.

21:02.819 --> 21:06.865
lf l know him, his understanding
will not long be withheld.

21:10.164 --> 21:12.204
Come on, you guys!

21:16.632 --> 21:19.420
- l'll kill him!
- Come on.

21:19.636 --> 21:23.767
- But first l want to hurt him a whole lot.
- Take him over there.

21:26.437 --> 21:30.187
Get him out of here.
Out of this bar, out of my life for ever.

21:30.360 --> 21:34.360
Normie, l'll go.
But l want you to remember one thing.

21:34.533 --> 21:36.941
l confessed and got you out of jail.

21:37.121 --> 21:40.075
l wouldn't have been in jail
if it wasn't for you!

21:40.249 --> 21:46.089
All right, l'm sorry about that, Normie.
l'm really sorry, but try and understand.

21:46.259 --> 21:52.263
Your job's just a job,
but being a mailman's my whole identity.

21:52.474 --> 21:57.436
l risked my whole world,
my entire life, to buy your freedom,

21:57.607 --> 22:00.645
because l love you, Norm.

22:01.655 --> 22:05.191
Come on, Norm,
isn't there something Cliff can do?

22:07.288 --> 22:09.995
Norman, he's right.

22:12.796 --> 22:15.418
What is your heart telling you?

22:15.591 --> 22:19.840
- Never mind. lt's a long story.
- Goodbye, Norm.

22:21.600 --> 22:24.010
All right, wait, Cliffie.

22:26.358 --> 22:31.900
l guess we have been friends a long
time. You are, by nature, a weasel.

22:36.705 --> 22:40.206
There's something
you can do for me, l guess.

22:40.378 --> 22:42.835
You can buy me a beer...

22:46.970 --> 22:50.009
...with your pants around your ankles.

22:52.020 --> 22:56.267
- You can't be serious, Norm.
- Ankles, Cliffie.

22:56.442 --> 23:01.866
Standing on that stool
while barking like a seal.

23:12.800 --> 23:15.922
Let's not stay.
There'll be a cover charge.
