00:18.185 --> 00:22.063
My people have used this
peyote for generations

00:22.064 --> 00:25.818
to open the mind and to
explore a greater freedom.

00:28.696 --> 00:33.033
We have cultivated this
medicine and this land.

00:33.034 --> 00:35.869
Now all I have is
this reservation.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.704
Is that the moon?

00:37.705 --> 00:39.456
This is the sun.

00:39.457 --> 00:42.042
It's for your people.

00:42.043 --> 00:44.377
This is big medicine.

00:44.378 --> 00:47.338
But there's grave
consequences if you abuse it.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.011
Set my mind free, medicine man.

00:56.599 --> 01:02.228
Take this, and you will explore
every crevice of your mind.

01:02.229 --> 01:05.732
You will know yourself
more than you ever have.

01:05.733 --> 01:10.195
You may realize your
greatest desires,

01:10.196 --> 01:13.323
but you may also face
your fiercest enemy.

01:18.079 --> 01:19.579
There are risks.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.663
Risks?

01:20.664 --> 01:22.582
There's always risks.

01:22.583 --> 01:26.086
You must respect this,
and you must care for it.

01:27.713 --> 01:31.091
I will.

01:31.092 --> 01:32.092
I promise.

01:34.136 --> 01:38.890
Promises are always
broken by your people.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.517
My words are pure.

01:40.518 --> 01:43.686
I speak the truth.

01:43.687 --> 01:44.687
That'll be $20.

02:02.540 --> 02:03.790
This isn't going to end well.

03:08.898 --> 03:10.899
Hey, would you stop it?

03:10.900 --> 03:12.775
You're going to break it.

03:12.776 --> 03:15.112
Would you just stop fidgeting
and fucking with everything?

03:18.490 --> 03:19.449
Got my lighter?

03:19.450 --> 03:21.367
Just tell me one thing.

03:21.368 --> 03:23.536
What is your philosophy,
again, against putting a air

03:23.537 --> 03:25.371
conditioner in this car?

03:25.372 --> 03:27.498
It's original, man.

03:27.499 --> 03:30.627
It would be like me painting
your Gibson sunburst

03:30.628 --> 03:31.711
fucking metallic blue.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.546
It's criminal.

03:33.547 --> 03:36.341
Metallic blue.

03:36.342 --> 03:37.217
I could rock that.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.843
Yeah?

03:38.844 --> 03:42.305
There's nothing
criminal about being cool.

03:43.641 --> 03:45.099
You know shit about
being cool, man.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.100
Oh.

03:52.816 --> 03:56.778
Vintage
guitars on the boulevard.

03:56.779 --> 04:00.448
You're my girl on the street.

04:00.449 --> 04:08.331
You make me feel so high
underneath the sheets.

04:08.332 --> 04:13.712
I wanted to get away, but
now you make me want to stay.

04:26.100 --> 04:27.600
Why'd you do that?

04:27.601 --> 04:29.519
Dude, I'm just singing
what I feel, bro.

04:29.520 --> 04:30.561
Come on.

04:30.562 --> 04:33.064
Taught him that.

04:33.065 --> 04:34.732
Sing what you feel, baby.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.859
Love, this is not a
band-whispering moment, okay?

04:36.860 --> 04:38.111
This is members only.

04:38.112 --> 04:40.196
Like Danny's jacket?

04:40.197 --> 04:41.948
Yeah, I can smell it.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.119
Dude, rock and
roll died when bands

04:46.120 --> 04:47.370
stopped wearing the makeup.

04:47.371 --> 04:48.329
You said it yourself.

04:48.330 --> 04:49.080
Okay, sure.

04:49.081 --> 04:50.039
Yeah, whatever.

04:50.040 --> 04:50.915
We need to be current.

04:50.916 --> 04:52.667
We can't go back.

04:52.668 --> 04:57.213
Yeah, but current doesn't
mean changing who you are.

04:57.214 --> 04:58.673
I miss the makeup.

04:58.674 --> 04:59.674
Mm.

05:09.601 --> 05:12.103
Was that the guy?

05:12.104 --> 05:13.187
No, man.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.565
This guy doesn't eat jerky.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.817
He's a vegetarian.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.319
We're looking for a fruit stand.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.653
A vegetarian Indian.

05:20.654 --> 05:21.779
They got those?

05:21.780 --> 05:24.490
Yeah, they fucking got those.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.117
An Indian that doesn't eat meat?

05:26.118 --> 05:28.161
You got to stop
saying Indian, man.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.830
It's not cool.

05:30.831 --> 05:35.668
No, you got to say, like,
Native American now.

05:35.669 --> 05:36.836
Native American.

05:36.837 --> 05:37.420
Yeah.

05:37.421 --> 05:38.338
Come on.

05:38.339 --> 05:40.173
It's what they're doing.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.716
So wait, if I'm a kid now and
I want to go out and play,

05:41.717 --> 05:44.927
I've got to play cowboys
and Native Americans?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.346
They don't care
about Western crap.

05:46.347 --> 05:47.680
Mm.

05:47.681 --> 05:51.476
They're into robots
and space shit.

05:51.477 --> 05:53.144
Maybe a white guy
should be offended

05:53.145 --> 05:54.562
when they call him a cowboy.

05:54.563 --> 05:55.855
Yeah?

05:55.856 --> 05:57.732
What do you want
them to be called?

05:57.733 --> 06:01.320
I don't know, maybe a tan-skin
guy with a wide-brimmed hat.

06:04.156 --> 06:06.866
Look, there goes an Indi...

06:06.867 --> 06:11.496
Native American and a tan
guy with a wide-brimmed hat.

06:11.497 --> 06:13.122
That's what you want
them to be called.

06:13.123 --> 06:14.999
Yeah.

06:15.000 --> 06:18.002
What we need is a hard-rocking
hit, man, hard-working song

06:18.003 --> 06:20.004
that's going to
define music today.

06:20.005 --> 06:20.880
Back me up, Danny.

06:20.881 --> 06:21.839
Metal is dead.

06:21.840 --> 06:22.882
It's not coming back.

06:22.883 --> 06:23.925
Get over it.

06:23.926 --> 06:24.842
Dude, we changed our name.

06:24.843 --> 06:26.344
We've changed our look.

06:26.345 --> 06:28.471
We've changed our
approach to the music.

06:28.472 --> 06:29.847
Where's the integrity, man?

06:29.848 --> 06:32.308
There's no truth in it.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.894
Right?

06:34.895 --> 06:36.771
We need to go back to our roots.

06:36.772 --> 06:37.730
You know?

06:37.731 --> 06:39.232
Look, think about it.

06:39.233 --> 06:42.443
"Don't Close Your
Eyes" was a bad-ass...

06:42.444 --> 06:46.739
Don't even say the
word "power ballad"!

06:46.740 --> 06:48.741
Nobody respects a power
ballad, all right?

06:48.742 --> 06:51.577
AC/DC, they never
had one power ballad.

06:51.578 --> 06:52.745
That is true.

06:52.746 --> 06:54.038
They do not have one.

06:54.039 --> 06:56.624
What is this whole
trip about, huh?

06:56.625 --> 07:00.086
This whole trip is a
search to find ourselves,

07:00.087 --> 07:03.756
to find who we are, to
bring it back together.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.841
Right?

07:04.842 --> 07:05.967
Look at all these new bands now.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.552
They don't have pyrotechnics.

07:07.553 --> 07:09.387
They don't have sparks
flying on the stage.

07:09.388 --> 07:11.806
They don't have blood
covering the audience

07:11.807 --> 07:14.434
from some animal who's
getting its head ripped off.

07:14.435 --> 07:16.060
It's all tame.

07:16.061 --> 07:19.439
We need to go to Coachella
and fucking rock.

07:19.440 --> 07:20.022
Yes.

07:20.023 --> 07:21.482
Yes!

07:21.483 --> 07:22.900
And I agree 100%!

07:22.901 --> 07:24.819
By the way, it's
called Nochella.

07:24.820 --> 07:25.736
What?

07:25.737 --> 07:26.696
No, it's Coachella.

07:26.697 --> 07:27.947
Yeah, it's Coachella.

07:27.948 --> 07:29.365
No.

07:29.366 --> 07:33.077
No, I couldn't get
us into Coachella.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.621
But I got us in Nochella,
which is way more hip.

07:35.622 --> 07:37.457
Coachella's like the
Sundance Film Festival.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.250
Nobody goes to that anymore.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.043
They go to Slamdance.

07:41.044 --> 07:43.963
Where the new emerging
acts are, making deals,

07:43.964 --> 07:45.548
that's where I want my band.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.091
And that's where
you're going to be,

07:47.092 --> 07:48.968
as long as you keep
it to three songs.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.053
And I know you're
going to hate this,

07:51.054 --> 07:54.932
but I promised we'd open up
with "Don't Close Your Eyes."

07:54.933 --> 07:56.601
Come on, man!

07:56.602 --> 07:58.686
I just said we're not
playing that song anymore!

07:58.687 --> 07:59.812
I just said that!

07:59.813 --> 08:00.646
Fuck, Danny!

08:00.647 --> 08:01.606
Come on!

08:01.607 --> 08:02.690
That's bullshit, man!

08:02.691 --> 08:06.152
No more power ballads!

08:06.153 --> 08:07.820
We're going in a new direction!

08:07.821 --> 08:09.530
That's what I just said!

08:09.531 --> 08:11.657
I just fucking said that, Danny!

08:11.658 --> 08:13.493
We are going to kill it!

08:14.912 --> 08:16.287
Shit.

08:16.288 --> 08:17.330
There goes the alignment.

08:17.331 --> 08:18.331
Fuck.

08:22.127 --> 08:24.504
This road blows.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.298
There's a meteor shower.

08:27.299 --> 08:28.674
Dummy.

08:28.675 --> 08:30.426
No, I'm not kidding...
Like asteroids.

08:30.427 --> 08:31.302
You know what I mean?

08:31.303 --> 08:32.678
Or space junk.

08:32.679 --> 08:35.556
Will you see if... Look at that.

08:35.557 --> 08:37.308
Fucking crazy.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.352
I'm telling you, man, that
could be like space junk.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.438
That could be like the
space station fell down.

08:42.438 --> 08:43.563
You know what?

08:43.565 --> 08:44.148
You just need to stop talking.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.149
Careful.

08:48.362 --> 08:49.820
Sputnik.

08:52.241 --> 08:53.991
We're having no fun.

08:53.992 --> 08:56.244
No, I don't care what
Merrick's Facebook page says.

08:56.245 --> 09:01.040
He's... you know
what's wrong with him.

09:01.041 --> 09:02.875
Okay, don't believe what you...

09:02.876 --> 09:04.835
Don't read his Facebook.

09:04.836 --> 09:05.628
All right.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.255
Bye.

09:07.256 --> 09:08.923
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:08.924 --> 09:10.550
Where are we going, guys?

09:10.551 --> 09:11.676
Picking up supplies.

09:11.677 --> 09:13.177
We aren't even on the 10.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.637
Supplies?

09:14.638 --> 09:15.972
Yeah, you want us
to be a band, right?

09:15.973 --> 09:18.224
Come together, write
some good songs?

09:18.225 --> 09:21.185
Can we consider this
a job for a moment?

09:21.186 --> 09:23.938
Does everything have to
be a fun factory with you?

09:23.939 --> 09:25.064
Everything?

09:25.065 --> 09:26.774
You know what would be great?

09:26.775 --> 09:29.986
How about a little more focus,
little more disciplined?

09:29.987 --> 09:33.030
Well, I took some
focusyn earlier.

09:33.031 --> 09:35.366
Maybe Stevie can find
you a chill pill.

09:35.367 --> 09:37.910
Guess what... I've already had
10 freaking chill pills since we

09:37.911 --> 09:39.955
left LA, and this is what I got.

10:16.408 --> 10:19.410
Organic, huh?

10:19.411 --> 10:20.996
Supposed to be the
best stuff, period.

10:25.542 --> 10:26.835
Let me do the talking.

10:34.760 --> 10:37.428
We're here to do some shopping.

10:37.429 --> 10:38.429
Yeah.

10:44.978 --> 10:45.978
Bigfoot?

10:48.148 --> 10:50.733
Yeah.

10:50.734 --> 10:51.734
We want to buy the moon.

10:54.571 --> 10:58.282
Moon's no longer for sale.

10:58.283 --> 10:59.283
Fuck.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.329
But I can sell you the sun.

11:06.333 --> 11:06.999
Sun sounds good.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
Yeah.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.172
Come on back.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.176
Okay.

11:19.554 --> 11:20.681
Don't step on them.

11:28.230 --> 11:29.230
Okay.

11:40.117 --> 11:42.076
I know karate.

11:42.077 --> 11:44.453
Man, you don't know
shit about karate.

11:44.454 --> 11:45.955
I took karate.

11:45.956 --> 11:47.206
You took one fucking class.

11:47.207 --> 11:48.290
I know enough.

11:48.291 --> 11:49.834
Okay, here we are, big fruit.

11:49.835 --> 11:51.585
I can break a board.

11:51.586 --> 11:53.129
You fucking got a splinter, man.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.588
Yeah, but the board broke.

11:54.589 --> 11:57.216
We get some organic
drugs apparently...

11:57.217 --> 12:00.720
First organic thing Art's had
in his body for a long time.

12:00.721 --> 12:01.722
Hope he doesn't explode.

12:10.105 --> 12:12.898
Wow, this place is amazing.

12:12.899 --> 12:14.316
Yeah.

12:14.317 --> 12:17.403
Look at all this fresh fruit.

12:17.404 --> 12:20.239
Yeah, it's great.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.367
Thanks for sharing,
Love, as always.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.203
Aw, yeah.

12:26.204 --> 12:27.496
Thanks, babe.

12:27.497 --> 12:29.331
Mm.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.959
It's always so nice
of you to share.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.921
Yes.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.924
Oh my god.

12:38.925 --> 12:42.344
Oh, yeah.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.095
Oh.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.096
Oh my gosh.

12:44.097 --> 12:44.680
This one?

12:44.681 --> 12:45.765
God?

12:45.766 --> 12:47.006
Hey, that doesn't look organic.

12:49.978 --> 12:51.229
Sure hope not.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.733
I'm Pager.

12:55.734 --> 12:56.609
Sam.

12:56.610 --> 12:57.610
Lisa.

12:59.404 --> 13:00.404
You hitting the festival?

13:03.825 --> 13:05.284
Yeah.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.162
You going?

13:08.163 --> 13:09.414
I'm playing it.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.044
What's the name of your band?

13:15.045 --> 13:16.045
Sonic Grave.

13:19.007 --> 13:21.467
Didn't you guys change
your name to Timewarp?

13:21.468 --> 13:23.093
Yeah.

13:23.094 --> 13:26.138
Well, yeah, but we changed
it back to Sonic Grave.

13:26.139 --> 13:26.972
You know it?

13:26.973 --> 13:28.808
Mhm.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.893
My mom used to play "Don't
Close Your Eyes" all the time.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.770
Huh.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.021
She got preggers to that song
when you took her backstage

13:34.022 --> 13:36.816
at a concert in Philly.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.777
It's nice to finally
meet you, Daddy.

13:43.907 --> 13:46.492
Really?

13:47.369 --> 13:50.162
No, man.

13:50.163 --> 13:53.666
I was totally fucking
with you, man.

13:53.667 --> 13:56.252
No, but power ballads,
they don't get

13:56.253 --> 13:57.795
the street cred they used to.

13:57.796 --> 14:00.589
"Don't Close Your Eyes"
is some serious shit.

14:00.590 --> 14:02.466
You goddamn right
it's serious shit.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.885
And Pager here is going to rip
a solo at that festival that'll

14:04.886 --> 14:07.638
make your panties roll down your
legs, walk across the floor,

14:07.639 --> 14:09.265
and fold in the corner.

14:09.266 --> 14:10.307
Danny Bloom.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.475
Nice to meet you, ladies.

14:11.476 --> 14:12.685
Hi.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.019
Hey.

14:14.020 --> 14:14.645
I'm not creepy.

14:14.646 --> 14:16.021
Yeah.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.606
I proved it in
court, And besides,

14:17.607 --> 14:18.858
who needs to be within
600 of a grade school.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.276
Am I right?

14:20.277 --> 14:21.151
I actually mentor
troubled trouble.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.486
Just... just stop.

14:22.487 --> 14:23.112
Okay.

14:23.113 --> 14:25.197
Just...
We got to get some drugs.

14:25.198 --> 14:25.781
Go lie down over there.

14:25.782 --> 14:26.490
Okay.

14:26.491 --> 14:27.491
He's cool.

14:29.995 --> 14:30.995
See you later.

14:39.713 --> 14:42.673
Okay.

14:42.674 --> 14:45.467
Shut the door.

14:45.468 --> 14:48.262
Sorry.

14:48.263 --> 14:51.182
Is this where you keep the sun?

15:04.779 --> 15:05.779
Okay.

15:16.791 --> 15:17.959
How much money you got?

15:20.795 --> 15:22.129
I got $80.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.490
That's how much
the moon is, right?

15:26.843 --> 15:29.637
$80?

15:29.638 --> 15:32.181
It's $200 for the sun.

15:32.182 --> 15:34.475
Well, I don't have that much.

15:34.476 --> 15:35.685
What about your friend?

15:41.441 --> 15:47.279
I don't carry a lot of
cash, just a card, bro.

15:47.280 --> 15:48.280
No problem.

15:54.329 --> 15:55.329
Bang!

15:59.376 --> 16:02.002
It's a $10 transaction fee.

16:08.718 --> 16:09.677
Tip.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.179
Okay.

16:16.810 --> 16:18.978
You must be careful
with the sun.

16:18.979 --> 16:20.729
It has big medicine.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.565
This is the most powerful
peyote you and your friend

16:23.566 --> 16:24.608
will ever take.

16:24.609 --> 16:26.235
Cool.

16:26.236 --> 16:28.362
It's a goddamn gift.

16:28.363 --> 16:30.739
Technically, I just paid for it.

16:30.740 --> 16:33.617
You take this just
before the sun goes down

16:33.618 --> 16:36.370
at the sacred Red Rocks.

16:36.371 --> 16:38.163
Okay.

16:38.164 --> 16:41.375
But if you hurt or destroy
anything on our sacred land

16:41.376 --> 16:44.837
while under this peyote...
And I mean anything...

16:44.838 --> 16:48.841
You as much as hurt
one fly, ramifications

16:48.842 --> 16:50.843
will be irreversible.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.970
You'll be cursing
till the next sundown.

16:52.971 --> 16:54.638
Oh.

16:54.639 --> 16:58.225
You respect it, like a
baby in your mama's womb.

16:58.226 --> 17:01.228
You understand?

17:01.229 --> 17:01.854
Yeah, man.

17:01.855 --> 17:03.939
Yeah.

17:03.940 --> 17:04.940
We got you, chief.

17:08.528 --> 17:09.778
Thank you.

17:09.779 --> 17:10.779
Come on.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.700
No tip.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.539
Man, what was that?

17:20.540 --> 17:22.040
That was weird, right?

17:22.041 --> 17:24.167
No, you called him chief.

17:24.169 --> 17:25.502
It was weird way before that.

17:30.258 --> 17:30.924
Organic?

17:30.925 --> 17:31.842
Mhm.

17:31.843 --> 17:34.720
Or orga...

17:34.721 --> 17:35.679
It's orgasmic.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.556
That's what I thought.

17:39.517 --> 17:41.185
Yeah, we're getting
the good stuff,

17:41.186 --> 17:43.270
like the really good stuff,
if you want to join us.

17:43.271 --> 17:45.439
We're way ahead of you.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.941
We got the sun.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.069
Oh, that's cool.

17:50.070 --> 17:51.862
You're going to meet
us by the rocks later?

17:51.863 --> 17:52.821
Yeah.

17:52.822 --> 17:53.405
Yeah, we'll meet you.

17:53.406 --> 17:54.114
Mhm.

17:54.115 --> 17:55.115
Yeah.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.617
Yeah, we'll be there.

17:56.618 --> 17:57.534
Yeah.

17:57.535 --> 17:58.285
We're going to be there.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.369
We'll be there.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.120
We were already going there.

18:00.121 --> 18:02.956
Bye.

18:02.957 --> 18:03.999
He's older than your dad.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.585
Oh, Lisa.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.671
40-something and still
pulling 20-nothing, baby.

18:09.672 --> 18:11.965
Yeah, that's a
two-man job, brother.

18:11.966 --> 18:13.509
We need another hit.

18:13.510 --> 18:18.013
Yeah, we do before it
gets sad, pathetic.

18:18.014 --> 18:19.014
Hey.

18:19.015 --> 18:19.890
What, did you get it?

18:19.891 --> 18:20.808
Yeah.

18:20.809 --> 18:21.809
Did you get the sun?

18:21.810 --> 18:22.768
That's the good shit.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.644
That's what they got.

18:23.645 --> 18:24.269
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:24.270 --> 18:24.978
Yeah!

18:24.979 --> 18:25.979
All right.

18:26.439 --> 18:27.022
Roll out.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.315
Come on.

18:33.947 --> 18:37.407
Yow!

18:37.408 --> 18:39.868
So you think we
have a lazy time.

18:39.869 --> 18:43.330
Well, you should know better.

18:43.331 --> 18:46.792
And I don't know why.

18:46.793 --> 18:50.796
I just don't know why.

18:50.797 --> 18:53.257
And you say I got a dirty mind.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.093
Well, I'm a big go-getter.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.972
How much of this thing
are we supposed to take?

18:59.973 --> 19:02.891
I thought you've done it before.

19:02.892 --> 19:06.520
Oh, I'm from the shire, but
I've never danced with the sun

19:06.521 --> 19:08.397
before.

19:08.398 --> 19:11.650
What are you fucking doing?

19:11.651 --> 19:14.153
Man, you're supposed to wait!

19:14.154 --> 19:15.070
For what?

19:15.071 --> 19:17.030
Sundown!

19:17.031 --> 19:19.116
Sundown at the sacred site, man.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.617
He talked all about it.

19:20.618 --> 19:21.994
Were you not listening?

19:21.995 --> 19:23.579
Ow.

19:23.580 --> 19:24.788
I was listening.

19:24.789 --> 19:26.123
It's pretty dark.

19:26.124 --> 19:27.499
I mean, I got my sunglasses on.

19:29.419 --> 19:30.919
It's all right.

19:30.920 --> 19:31.837
I can handle it.

19:31.838 --> 19:32.754
It'll be good.

19:32.755 --> 19:33.839
Everyone will get there.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.549
And I'll have another round.

19:35.550 --> 19:37.050
It'll be good.

19:37.051 --> 19:39.511
We're supposed to do it
as a band, all together.

19:39.512 --> 19:40.679
I got it.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.597
We're together.

19:41.598 --> 19:42.598
I just got there first.

19:45.393 --> 19:47.060
I'm sorry.

19:47.061 --> 19:48.228
Let's get out of here.

19:48.229 --> 19:48.812
Yo!

19:48.813 --> 19:50.439
No!

19:50.440 --> 19:51.523
I'm going to...

19:51.524 --> 19:56.361
Ah, it's all right.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.279
Come here.

19:57.280 --> 19:58.698
You want some, together?

20:00.325 --> 20:03.827
Cum on feel the noize.

20:03.828 --> 20:06.288
Girls, grab your boys.

20:06.289 --> 20:12.753
We get wild, wild, wild.

20:41.074 --> 20:46.286
Hey, you feeling anything?

20:46.287 --> 20:48.080
Yeah.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.081
I'm good.

20:54.462 --> 20:55.462
Moon.

21:02.345 --> 21:03.345
Oxygen.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.181
It's so spiritual here.

21:12.188 --> 21:15.148
Respect nature and
it will respect you.

21:15.149 --> 21:17.776
Oh, man, that's beautiful.

21:17.777 --> 21:18.568
You're beautiful.

21:18.569 --> 21:19.820
Woo!

21:19.821 --> 21:21.154
Hey!

21:21.155 --> 21:22.656
It's a little tree
hugger for me.

21:22.657 --> 21:24.408
Give it a chance.

21:24.409 --> 21:25.701
It's a special place.

21:25.702 --> 21:26.702
Wow.

21:29.664 --> 21:30.664
I want to rock!

21:50.643 --> 21:53.437
Art, man, you cool?

21:58.818 --> 22:00.153
Yeah, he's cool.

22:07.660 --> 22:08.660
Right here.

22:08.661 --> 22:09.661
Oh.

22:11.622 --> 22:12.622
Whoa.

22:17.545 --> 22:20.964
Art, man, you're tripping.

22:20.965 --> 22:21.965
Whoa.

22:24.886 --> 22:30.932
You've got a extra
eye, right there.

22:30.933 --> 22:33.060
Whoa.

22:33.061 --> 22:34.311
Can it see me?

22:34.312 --> 22:35.312
Can it blink?

22:39.067 --> 22:40.317
Okay.

22:40.318 --> 22:41.568
Here's what's going to happen.

22:41.569 --> 22:42.903
You're going to go to the truck.

22:42.904 --> 22:44.363
You're going to get some sleep.

22:44.364 --> 22:46.365
I'm going to come
get you at sundown.

22:46.366 --> 22:47.407
Only I'll take the stuff.

22:47.408 --> 22:48.033
Okay?

22:48.034 --> 22:48.617
Yeah.

22:48.618 --> 22:49.618
Come on.

22:54.374 --> 22:55.666
I'm watching you.

22:59.796 --> 23:00.796
Go bowling.

23:06.260 --> 23:07.719
Is he all right?

23:07.720 --> 23:08.720
Eh.

23:13.518 --> 23:14.518
No.

23:18.439 --> 23:20.482
Fuck.

23:20.483 --> 23:21.525
Give me these poles here.

23:21.526 --> 23:22.442
What are those stakes?

23:22.443 --> 23:23.485
Oh, they go with it?

23:23.486 --> 23:24.277
Give me these poles, man.

23:24.278 --> 23:27.656
Yeah.

23:27.657 --> 23:29.783
Nice being out here, right?

23:29.784 --> 23:30.742
There you go.

23:30.743 --> 23:31.827
Okay, easy, easy, easy.

23:31.828 --> 23:33.537
When do we take this stuff?

23:33.538 --> 23:35.080
Sundown.

23:35.081 --> 23:38.792
Just after sun sets, we
pray to the music gods.

23:38.793 --> 23:40.085
We wait.

23:40.086 --> 23:41.420
You remember that
time in Georgia?

23:41.421 --> 23:42.921
Oh, yeah, at the
fucking campground?

23:42.922 --> 23:44.840
Camped with our fans... Mhm.

23:44.841 --> 23:46.842
And they were awesome.

23:46.843 --> 23:49.469
Then we wore those white
hats with the fucking thing,

23:49.470 --> 23:51.930
and we put on the
white a linen...

23:51.931 --> 23:53.014
That was bitching, man.

23:53.015 --> 23:53.932
That was cool.

23:53.933 --> 23:54.850
Then we burned a cross.

23:54.851 --> 23:55.642
That was bitching, man.

23:55.643 --> 23:57.144
Remember that?

23:57.145 --> 23:58.770
Then we wanted to put
that in our video,

23:58.771 --> 24:00.272
and then the record
company's like, oh my god.

24:00.273 --> 24:01.773
That will ruin your
careers and your lives.

24:01.774 --> 24:03.650
And you were like, hey,
oh, it's cool, man.

24:03.651 --> 24:06.194
Later we found out it
was a KKK convention.

24:06.195 --> 24:08.363
But still, our fan base...

24:08.364 --> 24:09.322
They were cool.

24:09.323 --> 24:09.948
They were really cool.

24:09.949 --> 24:11.241
Yeah.

24:11.242 --> 24:12.993
Maybe we should
give them a hand.

24:12.994 --> 24:16.621
This goes through here.

24:16.622 --> 24:18.123
Should we?

24:18.124 --> 24:19.249
Would you rather have
a thin, long dick

24:19.250 --> 24:21.751
like that or a short, fat one?

24:21.752 --> 24:23.378
Dude, I don't have
to worry about that.

24:23.379 --> 24:24.463
Yeah.

24:24.464 --> 24:25.338
It's all about teamwork man.

24:25.339 --> 24:26.465
Let's do it.

25:22.355 --> 25:24.856
Hoo!

25:24.857 --> 25:25.857
Ow!

25:31.739 --> 25:33.198
Ooh.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.199
Ow.

25:36.244 --> 25:37.869
Oh, you little shit.

25:37.870 --> 25:39.788
Come here.

25:39.789 --> 25:42.249
Oh, you little fire ant.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.417
I'm going to call the
called fire department.

25:54.971 --> 25:57.472
You as much as hurt
one fly, you'll

25:57.473 --> 25:59.100
be cursed until
the next sundown.

26:04.689 --> 26:05.689
Take that.

26:11.153 --> 26:13.280
Dude, you just fucked up.

26:13.281 --> 26:16.950
I'm going to make it rain blood.

26:16.951 --> 26:18.451
What?

26:18.452 --> 26:20.036
Your lack of respect
for yourself and others

26:20.037 --> 26:21.871
will be your demise.

26:41.684 --> 26:44.102
Late for every show for 20
years, that fucking guy.

26:44.103 --> 26:45.604
He's the last fucking
guy to show up.

26:45.605 --> 26:47.355
Where is he?

26:47.356 --> 26:48.982
I can't find him.

26:48.983 --> 26:50.150
Can't find him?

26:50.151 --> 26:51.234
What the fuck?

26:51.235 --> 26:52.902
I'm not his mother.

26:52.903 --> 26:53.778
Goddamn it!

26:53.779 --> 26:55.322
Every time.

26:55.323 --> 26:57.115
You guys can't come
together on anything,

26:57.116 --> 27:00.452
not even taking our
visionary medicine in unison.

27:00.453 --> 27:02.454
You're fucking ridiculous!

27:02.455 --> 27:03.288
You know what?

27:03.289 --> 27:05.206
Never mind.

27:05.207 --> 27:06.166
We don't need art.

27:06.167 --> 27:07.667
He's the bass player.

27:07.668 --> 27:09.794
It's not like he's
the voice of the band.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.129
It's true.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.130
He'll get here
when he gets here.

27:12.131 --> 27:13.840
Let's get this going.

27:13.841 --> 27:14.674
You got that shit?

27:14.675 --> 27:16.468
You got it?

27:16.469 --> 27:18.261
Oh, that's it, baby.

27:18.262 --> 27:21.056
Time for a trip.

27:21.057 --> 27:22.807
Not for nothing, Love.

27:22.808 --> 27:23.892
It's a band trip.

27:23.893 --> 27:26.269
Maybe you should stay home.

27:26.270 --> 27:27.395
Chill.

27:27.396 --> 27:30.565
She's coming on the trip.

27:30.566 --> 27:31.941
How much do we take?

27:31.942 --> 27:33.401
This seems to do the trick.

27:33.402 --> 27:35.028
Yeah, that's about right.

27:35.029 --> 27:36.905
Good times.

27:36.906 --> 27:37.822
All right.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.783
, woman.

27:39.784 --> 27:41.326
Get on it.

27:41.327 --> 27:43.370
Listen, listen, listen.

27:43.371 --> 27:46.373
Bigfoot was very
clear about this, okay?

27:46.374 --> 27:47.666
We take it.

27:47.667 --> 27:48.750
We enjoy it.

27:48.751 --> 27:49.668
It's gentle.

27:49.669 --> 27:50.877
We open our minds.

27:50.878 --> 27:52.712
Right?

27:52.713 --> 27:58.009
But we got to respect the land,
every living thing, every life.

27:58.010 --> 27:59.511
Okay?

27:59.512 --> 28:00.637
We do that, then we'll
have a good trip.

28:00.638 --> 28:02.389
That's what he said.

28:02.390 --> 28:05.850
I think this is the stuff
that inspired Kurt Cobain.

28:05.851 --> 28:07.018
Mm.

28:07.019 --> 28:08.645
Yeah.

28:08.646 --> 28:10.146
Yeah, let's hope you
have a different outcome.

28:10.147 --> 28:11.731
I'm going to write a
fucking killer song.

28:11.732 --> 28:13.900
I'm going to write a
killer song tonight.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.695
Hey, from your lips
to the big man's ears.

28:16.696 --> 28:19.447
This is a big, big
moment for this band.

28:19.448 --> 28:20.740
It is.

28:20.741 --> 28:21.741
Important night
for the band, man.

28:21.742 --> 28:23.827
It is.

28:23.828 --> 28:25.578
Are you fucking shitting me?

28:25.579 --> 28:26.996
What the fuck?

28:26.997 --> 28:28.081
It's all gone?

28:28.082 --> 28:29.749
Yes, it's all gone!

28:29.750 --> 28:33.044
Fucking... are you
fucking kidding me?

28:33.045 --> 28:35.505
You guys are so fucking
selfish and stupid!

28:35.506 --> 28:37.006
Fuck you!

28:37.007 --> 28:37.882
Fucking Love.

28:37.883 --> 28:39.008
I told Love.

28:39.009 --> 28:40.218
Why do you always pick on me?

28:40.219 --> 28:41.136
You saw that.

28:41.137 --> 28:42.053
Fuck you.

28:42.054 --> 28:43.471
Write a great song.

28:43.472 --> 28:45.390
Danny, don't take
it personal, man.

28:45.391 --> 28:46.850
You're the business end.

28:46.851 --> 28:50.562
I thought there was
another bag, man.

28:58.529 --> 29:00.822
I really feel the
need to say something.

29:00.823 --> 29:02.699
Oh, fucking Christ.

29:02.700 --> 29:03.658
What do you got to say?

29:03.659 --> 29:05.577
By all means.

29:05.578 --> 29:08.204
Say something.

29:08.205 --> 29:12.792
As we embark on this
moonlight journey,

29:12.793 --> 29:20.467
I ask the spirits to guide us,
have them lead us to the music,

29:20.468 --> 29:24.596
take us to that place,
take us on an epic journey

29:24.597 --> 29:30.226
to the land of oz and back,
allow us to see all things,

29:30.227 --> 29:35.565
let us learn, let us grow,
because our time is now,

29:35.566 --> 29:37.442
so be it.

29:37.443 --> 29:40.195
We are the music.

29:40.196 --> 29:44.866
We are one.

29:44.867 --> 29:46.618
Yeah!

29:47.286 --> 29:49.204
Nice.

29:49.205 --> 29:51.122
I really felt that one.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.917
I felt that one over here.

29:56.587 --> 29:58.671
Wow.

29:58.672 --> 29:59.547
Right?

29:59.548 --> 30:00.548
Yeah.

30:12.520 --> 30:13.520
Come here.

30:52.476 --> 30:54.311
I feel my chakras aligning.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.915
I don't feel anything.

31:56.916 --> 31:57.832
Do you feel anything?

31:57.833 --> 31:59.126
Are you feeling it?

32:09.595 --> 32:10.595
Whatever.

32:19.772 --> 32:26.402
Metal's like a
war for the people

32:26.403 --> 32:27.612
who can hear the whisper.

32:27.613 --> 32:28.613
You know?

32:31.241 --> 32:32.742
Danny's fucking right.

32:32.743 --> 32:35.745
It's like we don't
fucking have it, man.

32:35.746 --> 32:36.789
We don't fucking have it.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.752
He's fucking right, man.

32:51.679 --> 32:53.930
It was a hot summer's night.

32:53.931 --> 32:56.975
She was sweating all over.

32:56.976 --> 33:01.813
She went to the fridge
for ch-ch-cherry cola.

33:01.814 --> 33:08.319
Hey, hey, girl, I want to get
to know you and maybe even see

33:08.320 --> 33:13.825
your areola from
your side boob, oh.

33:13.826 --> 33:14.534
What do you think?

33:14.535 --> 33:15.535
Yeah.

33:15.869 --> 33:17.286
Side boob.

33:18.747 --> 33:19.664
Stop.

33:19.665 --> 33:20.665
Man, quit dicking around

33:20.666 --> 33:21.708
Side boob.

33:21.709 --> 33:22.625
Quit dicking around, man.

33:22.626 --> 33:23.334
...come on.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.335
Lean over.

33:28.799 --> 33:29.799
What's that?

33:34.179 --> 33:35.138
Who is that?

33:35.139 --> 33:35.930
Is that a fucking cop?

33:35.931 --> 33:38.057
Is that a cop?

33:38.058 --> 33:39.350
Hey, we're camping out here.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.227
Our fucking campground.

33:41.228 --> 33:42.145
State your name.

33:42.146 --> 33:43.563
State your purpose.

33:43.564 --> 33:44.814
Your campground!

33:44.815 --> 33:46.691
State your name!

33:46.692 --> 33:47.901
We're... this our zone!

33:50.904 --> 33:53.322
I can't believe this shit.

33:53.323 --> 33:55.533
No, you got to be kidding me.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.994
Well, hey, if you don't
want us, we can go.

33:57.995 --> 33:59.287
Oh, shit.

33:59.288 --> 34:00.913
I don't know where
the hell we are.

34:00.914 --> 34:02.498
We're in the Indian
reservation or some shit.

34:02.499 --> 34:03.958
It's those girls from the thing.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.334
Hold my guitar, will you?

34:05.335 --> 34:07.211
Yeah, you know I
spent $20 on shampoo?

34:07.212 --> 34:09.922
Oh, hey.

34:09.922 --> 34:10.672
It's cool.

34:10.674 --> 34:11.757
I know them.

34:11.759 --> 34:13.092
Come on and join the party.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.344
Oh, my hair's a disgusting..

34:15.344 --> 34:17.263
What the fuck?

34:17.264 --> 34:18.556
My skin's dirty.

34:18.556 --> 34:19.223
I need a shower.

34:19.224 --> 34:20.725
Hell no.

34:20.726 --> 34:21.476
This is disgusting.

34:21.476 --> 34:22.976
I don't where...
Give me your phone!

34:22.978 --> 34:24.395
Hey!

34:24.396 --> 34:25.438
Listen, I want
everybody's phones.

34:25.438 --> 34:27.065
We're on a spiritual quest here.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.275
Real bands don't get
spiritual inspiration

34:29.275 --> 34:30.943
from fucking smartphones.

34:30.944 --> 34:31.694
You too, Missy.

34:31.695 --> 34:33.071
Put it in there.

34:33.072 --> 34:34.614
If you try anything
creepy, you're

34:34.614 --> 34:35.739
going to have a whole
new set of problems.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.449
Don't flatter yourself, baby.

34:37.451 --> 34:39.202
I've had plenty of ice
cream running down this arm.

34:39.203 --> 34:40.911
Put it in there.

34:40.913 --> 34:44.415
Hey, you guys, you got
to focus if it kills you.

34:44.416 --> 34:45.792
Put your phones
in here right now.

34:45.793 --> 34:47.085
There.

34:47.085 --> 34:47.960
There.

34:47.960 --> 34:48.920
Now listen to me.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.588
Now I'm dead serious.

34:50.589 --> 34:53.257
We are this close to
getting another shot,

34:53.257 --> 34:55.927
but we're also this
close to being a band

34:55.928 --> 34:58.012
that nobody fucking remembers.

34:58.013 --> 35:00.098
And it's up to you guys.

35:00.099 --> 35:00.932
This is your moment!

35:00.933 --> 35:01.933
Find it!

35:06.188 --> 35:07.188
Sh.

35:12.611 --> 35:15.113
I see a boob from the side.

35:15.114 --> 35:20.076
I can see her boobs
from the side.

35:24.832 --> 35:26.499
You know what?

35:26.500 --> 35:29.252
I'm kind of thinking I'm
feeling a little something.

35:29.253 --> 35:31.963
I think I'm kind of tripping.

35:31.964 --> 35:33.965
Those idiots will never
get their shit together

35:33.966 --> 35:34.966
and write another hit.

35:39.012 --> 35:40.012
Fuck!

36:45.370 --> 36:46.996
I love you.

36:46.997 --> 36:48.915
You got to know that.

36:48.916 --> 36:54.253
I know it's hard.

36:54.254 --> 36:55.414
I'm on the road all the time.

37:00.052 --> 37:02.845
But I want to be there for you.

37:02.846 --> 37:06.974
Do you understand?

37:06.975 --> 37:10.937
I'll stop asking for
threesomes all the time.

37:10.938 --> 37:14.232
Like you said, it's
just not romantic.

37:14.233 --> 37:15.442
I'm through playing around.

37:19.112 --> 37:21.072
I'm serious.

37:33.835 --> 37:35.795
What are you doing, man?

37:35.796 --> 37:36.796
Hey!

37:36.797 --> 37:37.713
No, no, no.

37:37.714 --> 37:38.798
What are you doing?

37:38.799 --> 37:40.299
What are you doing up there?

37:40.300 --> 37:42.760
Rock gods can fly, Pager.

37:42.761 --> 37:43.594
No, man.

37:43.595 --> 37:44.345
No!

37:44.346 --> 37:45.137
It's what we do.

37:45.138 --> 37:45.721
No, man!

37:45.722 --> 37:46.347
No!

37:46.348 --> 37:47.139
Don't!

37:47.140 --> 37:48.432
You can't fly!

37:48.433 --> 37:54.730
I will fly like an eagle!

37:54.731 --> 37:56.190
No!

38:00.654 --> 38:01.779
Ow!

38:01.780 --> 38:04.615
My wings... my wings failed me!

38:04.616 --> 38:05.616
Ow!

38:12.124 --> 38:13.958
Wake up!

38:13.959 --> 38:15.293
Wake up!

38:15.294 --> 38:16.210
Ow!

38:16.211 --> 38:17.253
Ah!

38:17.254 --> 38:19.171
What'd you do last night?

38:19.172 --> 38:20.381
Nothing, right?

38:20.382 --> 38:21.549
What'd you write last night?

38:24.011 --> 38:25.136
Side boob...

38:25.137 --> 38:26.971
oh, don't walk away.

38:26.972 --> 38:28.472
Side boob...

38:28.473 --> 38:29.932
I want to play.

38:29.933 --> 38:30.725
Nothing.

38:30.726 --> 38:31.767
You know why?

38:31.768 --> 38:33.436
Because you're an amateur.

38:33.437 --> 38:35.771
You're all amateurs, and
you've always been amateurs.

38:35.772 --> 38:37.565
And you know what's
worse than that?

38:37.566 --> 38:39.984
Only thing worse than an amateur
is an asshole who believes

38:39.985 --> 38:41.652
in amateurs, and that's me.

38:41.653 --> 38:42.361
Oh, shit.

38:42.362 --> 38:43.446
Okay?

38:43.447 --> 38:45.656
Because I believed in you guys.

38:45.657 --> 38:47.825
All I ever asked was for
you to get up on stage

38:47.826 --> 38:51.287
and play your music, show
off your God-given talents.

38:51.288 --> 38:53.247
Can you lower your voice?

38:53.248 --> 38:55.333
I've given you time, 25 years.

38:55.334 --> 38:57.001
Every day I'm on
the phone fucking

38:57.002 --> 38:59.086
busting my ass for you guys.

38:59.087 --> 39:01.339
I gave you every
penny I've ever made.

39:01.340 --> 39:04.175
And worst of all, I gave
you my fucking soul.

39:04.176 --> 39:07.094
And last night, you
murdered my soul.

39:07.095 --> 39:09.597
You shot my fucking
soul in the back.

39:09.598 --> 39:10.848
So fuck you.

39:10.849 --> 39:11.974
I quit.

39:11.975 --> 39:13.893
Oh, come on.

39:13.894 --> 39:14.977
Wait.

39:14.978 --> 39:15.853
Can I have my phone, please?

39:15.854 --> 39:16.979
It's in the car.

39:17.773 --> 39:18.522
Ah!

39:18.523 --> 39:20.232
Son of a bitch!

39:21.735 --> 39:23.235
Fuck!

39:24.237 --> 39:24.945
Christ.

39:24.946 --> 39:27.740
Holy shit.

39:27.741 --> 39:29.742
A fucking ant?

39:29.743 --> 39:31.285
That's a big-ass ant.

39:31.286 --> 39:31.994
Okay, bitch.

39:31.995 --> 39:33.496
Come on!

39:33.497 --> 39:34.872
Love, baby.

39:35.499 --> 39:38.209
Shit!

39:38.210 --> 39:38.793
Yeah!

39:38.794 --> 39:39.502
Cut it!

39:39.503 --> 39:41.921
Oh, shit.

39:41.922 --> 39:43.047
There's another one!

39:43.048 --> 39:44.590
There's a whole bunch of them!

39:51.390 --> 39:52.390
Ho!

39:52.391 --> 39:53.391
Help!

39:55.310 --> 39:56.852
Get him in there.

39:56.853 --> 39:57.853
Art!

39:57.854 --> 39:59.355
Is that you, man?

40:00.273 --> 40:00.856
There you go.

40:00.857 --> 40:01.857
Ah!

40:05.779 --> 40:06.737
Come on.

40:06.738 --> 40:07.613
Hurry.

40:07.614 --> 40:08.239
All right, get in!

40:08.240 --> 40:09.240
Get in!

40:09.241 --> 40:10.157
Hurry up!

40:10.158 --> 40:11.242
What are you doing?

40:11.243 --> 40:12.701
Oh, man!

40:15.163 --> 40:16.664
We're coming, man!

40:16.665 --> 40:17.665
We're going to help you!

40:17.666 --> 40:21.085
Fuck Art!

40:27.467 --> 40:28.926
Shit.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.846
What's up?

40:31.847 --> 40:32.847
Fuck!

40:35.767 --> 40:37.059
Save yourselves, guys.

40:37.060 --> 40:38.519
They're coming!

40:38.520 --> 40:39.478
Holy shit!

40:39.479 --> 40:40.938
Get off my friend!

40:40.939 --> 40:42.398
Get off of him!

40:42.399 --> 40:44.400
He's a fucking bass player!

40:44.401 --> 40:45.860
Shit.

40:45.861 --> 40:46.861
Keys. Keys.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.158
Come on!

40:52.159 --> 40:55.744
He's not even anymore.

40:55.745 --> 40:57.204
Artie, let's go!

40:57.205 --> 40:59.165
Artie, come on, man!

40:59.749 --> 41:00.749
Get off!

41:01.626 --> 41:03.127
Oh, fuck!

41:03.128 --> 41:04.128
You bit me!

41:04.129 --> 41:05.629
Come on, Artie.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.131
Let's go.

41:09.634 --> 41:14.054
Shit!

41:14.055 --> 41:16.015
Hey, those ants are coming!

41:16.016 --> 41:17.516
Come on!

41:24.900 --> 41:25.900
Keep going!

41:25.901 --> 41:26.901
Keep coming!

41:30.864 --> 41:32.281
It even got my fucking gun!

41:32.282 --> 41:33.365
We're going to die!

41:33.366 --> 41:34.450
We're going to fucking die!

41:34.451 --> 41:35.701
They're fucking eating us alive!

41:35.702 --> 41:37.495
Maybe it's the peyote.

41:37.496 --> 41:39.872
Maybe this is all just
a big hallucination.

41:39.873 --> 41:42.124
I didn't eat any peyote, okay?

41:43.001 --> 41:44.877
Where's Lisa?

41:44.878 --> 41:46.712
Oh, she's in the car.

41:46.713 --> 41:47.505
She's in the car.

41:47.506 --> 41:49.548
She's fine.

41:49.549 --> 41:50.174
Fucking took Art's
fucking arm off!

41:50.175 --> 41:51.091
I know!

41:51.092 --> 41:51.800
Bit his fucking arm!

41:51.801 --> 41:52.760
Calm down!

41:52.761 --> 41:53.802
In my arm!

41:53.803 --> 41:55.346
We've been through worse!

41:55.347 --> 41:56.972
That's not the first
band member we've lost!

41:56.973 --> 41:57.598
Man, he's the best bass
player there ever was, man!

41:57.599 --> 41:58.516
Fuck!

41:58.517 --> 41:59.266
We're going to die!

41:59.267 --> 42:00.351
His fucking arm.

42:00.352 --> 42:01.310
We can hire another bass player.

42:01.311 --> 42:02.353
We don't give up, man.

42:02.354 --> 42:03.854
That's right.

42:03.855 --> 42:04.730
All right?

42:04.731 --> 42:06.273
We'll replace him.

42:06.274 --> 42:07.066
You actually mentioned somebody

42:07.067 --> 42:07.775
the other day.

42:07.776 --> 42:08.359
Remember?

42:08.360 --> 42:08.984
Uh-huh.

42:08.985 --> 42:10.819
Yeah.

42:10.820 --> 42:11.612
When you were like, hey, maybe
we can get that other guy?

42:11.613 --> 42:12.404
Joey Ferraro.

42:12.405 --> 42:13.822
Joey Ferraro!

42:13.823 --> 42:14.615
He ca make it out
here by tomorrow.

42:14.616 --> 42:16.450
He was better!

42:16.451 --> 42:18.327
I didn't want to be the one who
told Art he wasn't in the band.

42:18.328 --> 42:19.411
Now with him being dead, we
don't have to go through that.

42:19.412 --> 42:20.162
That would have been traumatic.

42:20.163 --> 42:21.455
Call him up.

42:21.456 --> 42:22.206
I'm going to call
up Joey Ferraro.

42:22.207 --> 42:23.123
Call him up.

42:23.124 --> 42:23.707
Yeah, he's got two arms!

42:23.708 --> 42:24.291
So far.

42:24.292 --> 42:25.251
Okay.

42:25.252 --> 42:26.168
We're going to be okay.

42:26.169 --> 42:27.044
Okay, done with that.

42:27.045 --> 42:27.753
I want to go home!

42:27.754 --> 42:28.712
Oh my god!

42:28.713 --> 42:30.047
We're going to be okay.

42:30.048 --> 42:30.965
We've been through
so much worse.

42:30.966 --> 42:32.508
Are you kidding me?

42:32.509 --> 42:34.269
That shit happens every
day in rock and roll.

42:38.348 --> 42:39.348
What is that?

42:42.477 --> 42:43.936
Oh, shit.

42:43.937 --> 42:45.271
Look at the size of them.

42:45.272 --> 42:47.523
Can ants even get that big?

42:47.524 --> 42:48.566
No, man.

42:48.567 --> 42:50.568
I know ants.

42:50.569 --> 42:52.444
Really?

42:52.445 --> 42:53.612
Holy shit.

42:53.613 --> 42:54.989
Oh my god!

42:54.990 --> 42:55.781
Shit!

42:55.782 --> 42:56.949
Get it off me!

42:58.910 --> 43:00.411
Back up.

43:00.412 --> 43:01.453
Don't kill it!

43:01.454 --> 43:02.621
Just kick it out the door!

43:02.622 --> 43:03.914
What are you doing with a gun?

43:03.915 --> 43:05.249
I'm in the music industry.

43:05.834 --> 43:06.875
Oh!

43:06.876 --> 43:07.916
Shit, that's fucking loud!

43:11.381 --> 43:13.132
You're going to be okay.

43:13.133 --> 43:15.092
Get it off me!

43:15.093 --> 43:18.095
Yeah, I'm not so
sure about that.

43:18.096 --> 43:19.430
I got it.

43:19.431 --> 43:20.848
Please get it off me!

43:20.849 --> 43:21.557
I got it.

43:21.558 --> 43:22.641
Oh my god!

43:22.642 --> 43:23.762
That is some fucking picnic.

43:42.579 --> 43:44.496
These are the last two.

43:44.497 --> 43:46.957
Poor little guys... they're
really taking a beating

43:46.958 --> 43:48.250
out there on the highway.

43:48.251 --> 43:49.627
You'd think these
motorists would

43:49.628 --> 43:50.919
have a little more respect.

43:50.920 --> 43:53.047
Look, we got a bigger problem.

43:53.048 --> 43:55.215
The musicians?

43:55.216 --> 43:56.675
Fucking Sonic Grave.

43:56.676 --> 43:59.011
That power ballad is overrated.

43:59.012 --> 44:00.638
They never rocked.

44:00.639 --> 44:02.139
We need to prepare.

44:02.140 --> 44:03.140
I'll get the bazooka.

44:10.065 --> 44:13.484
Not loaded yet.

44:13.485 --> 44:15.361
Hm!

44:15.362 --> 44:16.402
Maybe you should carry it.

44:20.158 --> 44:21.158
What are we going to do?

44:24.037 --> 44:25.037
We were warned.

44:27.332 --> 44:29.833
What do you mean we were warned?

44:29.834 --> 44:30.793
Bigfoot.

44:30.794 --> 44:32.169
Who... who is Bigfoot?

44:32.170 --> 44:33.671
Bigfoot!

44:33.672 --> 44:35.422
The Native we bought
the peyote from.

44:35.423 --> 44:38.384
He said crazy shit would
happen if we effed up!

44:38.385 --> 44:39.593
How the fuck did we eff up?

44:39.594 --> 44:40.969
Art.

44:40.970 --> 44:43.389
Art must've killed an ant.

44:43.390 --> 44:45.891
We were told if we hurt one
living thing while we were

44:45.892 --> 44:48.852
on this sacred land, anything...
An animal, even a bug...

44:48.853 --> 44:49.728
It'll rise up.

44:49.729 --> 44:50.938
It'll come get us.

44:50.939 --> 44:52.022
Are these magic ants, man?

44:52.023 --> 44:53.691
Are these magic ants?

44:53.692 --> 44:55.567
It's going to get worse.

45:08.373 --> 45:09.665
Come on.

45:09.666 --> 45:11.375
Come on.

45:21.302 --> 45:22.177
They're gone.

45:22.178 --> 45:23.137
Great.

45:23.138 --> 45:23.846
Let's get out of here.

45:23.847 --> 45:26.223
Let's go.

45:26.224 --> 45:27.683
Shit.

45:27.684 --> 45:28.684
What?

45:28.685 --> 45:32.438
Art has... had the keys.

45:32.439 --> 45:33.772
Of course he did.

45:33.773 --> 45:35.649
You guys, I have mine.

45:35.650 --> 45:36.567
Okay, great.

45:36.568 --> 45:37.609
Great.

45:37.610 --> 45:38.318
Get the fuck out of here.

45:38.319 --> 45:39.278
Let's go.

45:39.279 --> 45:40.279
Hey.

45:47.412 --> 45:48.704
What was that?

45:48.705 --> 45:50.957
It was an ant, a
giant fucking ant.

45:54.502 --> 45:55.586
Shit, Lisa.

45:55.587 --> 45:59.089
We got to get out there.

45:59.090 --> 46:00.007
My god.

46:00.008 --> 46:00.966
We got to do something.

46:00.967 --> 46:02.593
Great.

46:02.594 --> 46:04.928
We got the keys.

46:04.929 --> 46:06.764
She's got the phones.

46:06.765 --> 46:08.432
What?

46:08.433 --> 46:11.477
I... they're in the back seat.

46:11.478 --> 46:13.353
Why did you do that?

46:13.354 --> 46:14.938
'Cause I thought it was a good
idea at the time, obviously.

46:14.939 --> 46:16.064
Oh, man.

46:16.065 --> 46:17.858
What are we going to do, man?

46:17.859 --> 46:19.610
We can't go out there.

46:19.611 --> 46:20.778
It's too fucking dangerous.

46:20.779 --> 46:22.654
We'll never get those keys.

46:22.655 --> 46:23.655
We got to get out there.

46:23.656 --> 46:24.656
We're going to save her.

46:24.657 --> 46:25.616
Don't worry.

46:25.617 --> 46:27.117
We're going to die.

46:27.118 --> 46:29.036
We're going to be...
It's going to be okay.

46:29.037 --> 46:29.995
We're going to get her.

46:29.996 --> 46:31.455
I'm going to save her.

46:31.456 --> 46:32.873
We'll get those phones, babe.

46:32.874 --> 46:34.208
I don't know what
we're going to do.

46:34.209 --> 46:36.126
It's so dangerous.

46:36.127 --> 46:37.127
Get the phones.

47:02.987 --> 47:03.987
Lisa!

47:05.949 --> 47:07.283
We got to do something.

47:40.733 --> 47:41.733
Oh.

47:51.703 --> 47:53.245
God, what it she doing?

47:53.246 --> 47:55.789
I don't know, but I'm
pretty sure this is not

47:55.790 --> 47:56.790
going to end well.

47:59.544 --> 48:02.004
Die, bitches!

48:05.884 --> 48:06.592
She's fine.

48:06.593 --> 48:07.509
Oh my god!

48:07.510 --> 48:08.510
I've survived worse.

48:16.603 --> 48:17.603
That was crazy.

48:17.604 --> 48:18.353
Oh my god.

48:18.354 --> 48:19.855
Don't look.

48:19.856 --> 48:20.564
Don't look.

48:20.565 --> 48:21.315
It's fine.

48:21.316 --> 48:22.232
She's fine.

48:22.233 --> 48:23.233
Oh my god.

48:23.234 --> 48:26.194
She's all yours.

48:26.195 --> 48:28.614
It's going to be okay.

48:28.615 --> 48:30.407
She was a good kid.

48:30.408 --> 48:31.116
She'll be missed.

48:31.117 --> 48:32.743
Hey, guys.

48:32.744 --> 48:33.827
We'll dedicate a song to
her for sure at Nochella.

48:33.828 --> 48:35.829
I mean, that's going to be...
Yeah.

48:35.830 --> 48:37.623
Maybe she's going to live.

48:37.624 --> 48:41.585
Listen, it's sad,
but it's mesmerizing.

48:41.586 --> 48:42.502
It's horrible.

48:42.503 --> 48:43.503
She's probably fine.

48:50.094 --> 48:51.970
Those assholes.

48:51.971 --> 48:54.766
The worst kind, except for
that Friday night in '95.

48:58.770 --> 49:01.104
Yeah, it's fine.

49:01.105 --> 49:02.731
They're so fucking big, man.

49:02.732 --> 49:03.649
They got bigger.

49:03.650 --> 49:06.193
It's a big fucking ant!

49:06.194 --> 49:08.236
Wait, wait, wait.

49:08.237 --> 49:10.697
We killed a man
inside of here, right?

49:10.698 --> 49:12.824
Yeah.

49:12.825 --> 49:14.577
Every time we kill one,
they'll get bigger.

49:17.580 --> 49:18.956
Okay.

49:18.957 --> 49:20.791
How do you know that?

49:20.792 --> 49:22.709
I don't know how I know.

49:22.710 --> 49:24.294
Do you know how to stop them?

49:24.295 --> 49:25.045
No.

49:25.046 --> 49:26.672
Okay, well, wait.

49:26.673 --> 49:29.299
Maybe we can't stop them
but we can outsmart them.

49:29.300 --> 49:31.134
What?

49:31.135 --> 49:32.260
I know ants.

49:32.261 --> 49:34.054
Look.

49:34.055 --> 49:35.847
Look, there's... ow...

49:35.848 --> 49:38.850
There's 22,000 species of
ants on all the continents.

49:38.851 --> 49:40.102
Right?

49:40.103 --> 49:41.853
But none on Antarctica.

49:41.854 --> 49:43.981
Okay, yeah, you know
what else is weird?

49:43.982 --> 49:46.650
You were supposed to be fucking
practicing and writing songs.

49:46.651 --> 49:48.652
And now I know you
were watching Jeopardy,

49:48.653 --> 49:50.153
because I saw that question!

49:50.154 --> 49:51.947
Look, I know about ants.

49:51.948 --> 49:53.824
And like, I used to
have this ant farm,

49:53.825 --> 49:55.617
and I used to watch them.

49:55.618 --> 49:57.953
And they would make these
little tunnels and little rooms

49:57.954 --> 49:59.663
and stuff.

49:59.664 --> 50:01.748
And I studied them, like
their behavior and everything.

50:01.749 --> 50:03.834
I can think like an ant.

50:03.835 --> 50:04.584
That's true.

50:04.585 --> 50:05.627
I believe that.

50:05.628 --> 50:06.628
Yeah, he's got a little...

50:06.629 --> 50:07.504
Ant-size brain.

50:07.505 --> 50:09.006
Right.

50:09.007 --> 50:11.675
Look, ants, their whole
purpose is to get food,

50:11.676 --> 50:14.469
to bang the queen, and make
more drones... soldiers...

50:14.470 --> 50:16.388
So the cycle continues.

50:16.389 --> 50:18.181
And everybody thinks
the queen is there

50:18.182 --> 50:19.850
to rule the roost and stuff.

50:19.851 --> 50:21.685
But it's not the case, man.

50:21.686 --> 50:25.731
She's just there to
bang and make more ants.

50:25.732 --> 50:27.441
Okay.

50:27.442 --> 50:28.316
What's the fucking point, man?

50:28.317 --> 50:29.109
What's the point?

50:29.110 --> 50:30.736
I don't know.

50:30.737 --> 50:33.613
But the point is, one ant,
it can't live by itself.

50:33.614 --> 50:35.032
It's like a single cell.

50:35.033 --> 50:36.116
You know?

50:36.117 --> 50:37.951
It needs an organism to survive.

50:37.952 --> 50:40.537
So in the case of
ants, the colony

50:40.538 --> 50:42.706
is like a super organism.

50:42.707 --> 50:44.708
Okay, what the fuck are
you talking about?

50:44.709 --> 50:45.751
What is he talking about?

50:45.752 --> 50:46.376
I have no idea.

50:46.377 --> 50:47.711
Hey... Exactly.

50:47.712 --> 50:49.546
What the fuck... let him finish.

50:49.547 --> 50:50.630
He's not finished yet?

50:50.631 --> 50:51.757
He seems like he's done, though.

50:51.758 --> 50:53.258
It seemed like it was the end.

50:53.259 --> 50:54.676
We need to take out
the super-organism.

50:54.677 --> 50:58.388
We need to cut off
the communication.

50:58.389 --> 51:00.140
How do we do that?

51:00.141 --> 51:02.267
We fuck up their antennas
so they can't communicate,

51:02.268 --> 51:03.268
and then they die.

51:06.647 --> 51:10.859
K.

51:10.860 --> 51:11.860
Cool.

51:15.239 --> 51:16.990
He did hear that
mostly on Jeopardy.

51:16.991 --> 51:18.201
I was sitting there with him.

51:22.580 --> 51:24.122
Hey, everybody.

51:24.123 --> 51:25.624
Danny here, a little
update from the road.

51:25.625 --> 51:28.668
Right now, we're trapped
in a fucking stinky tuna

51:28.669 --> 51:30.128
can with no air condition.

51:30.129 --> 51:32.631
And oh... and two guys died.

51:32.632 --> 51:34.299
Yeah.

51:34.300 --> 51:37.344
And over here, yeah, we got
a broken leg on this guy

51:37.345 --> 51:37.969
over here.

51:37.970 --> 51:39.554
Yeah.

51:39.555 --> 51:41.223
And the likelihood of
us making the festival

51:41.224 --> 51:42.933
is about the same likelihood
as my second ex-wife

51:42.934 --> 51:44.726
taking back the
herpes she gave me

51:44.727 --> 51:46.603
when she fucked the pool guy
because I was on the road

51:46.604 --> 51:48.647
with you fuckers all the time.

51:48.648 --> 51:50.357
Oh, and I almost
forget to mention...

51:50.358 --> 51:52.442
We're being attacked
by giant ants.

51:52.443 --> 51:54.111
Yeah, something
to do some cursed

51:54.112 --> 51:56.196
peyote, which I had none
of, because you guys are

51:56.197 --> 51:58.073
selfish pricks!

51:58.074 --> 52:00.617
That pretty much
sums up everything

52:00.618 --> 52:05.038
unless somebody else would
like to share some insight.

52:05.039 --> 52:06.039
Pager?

52:08.292 --> 52:11.628
Danny, come on, man.

52:11.629 --> 52:14.005
It's not the time.

52:14.006 --> 52:15.298
How about in 10 minutes
when we're fucking dead?

52:15.299 --> 52:16.508
Would that be the good time?

52:16.509 --> 52:17.801
You know what?

52:17.802 --> 52:20.804
If we do get out
of here, I'm done.

52:20.805 --> 52:22.389
I'm done.

52:22.390 --> 52:24.266
You know, it'd be cool
if we could figure out

52:24.267 --> 52:25.851
a way to confuse them.

52:25.852 --> 52:26.893
You know?

52:26.894 --> 52:31.398
Like jam their frequency.

52:31.399 --> 52:34.192
Hey, man, if you can
figure something out,

52:34.193 --> 52:35.993
I'll play that power
ballad whenever you want.

52:39.031 --> 52:40.866
Right on.

52:40.867 --> 52:43.160
You'd play the power ballad and
you wouldn't complain about it?

52:43.161 --> 52:44.327
Yeah.

52:44.328 --> 52:45.245
We'd rock that shit.

52:45.246 --> 52:46.663
Yeah.

52:46.664 --> 52:47.998
Well then, guess what, buddy...

52:47.999 --> 52:48.748
We're back.

52:48.749 --> 52:50.125
We're back.

52:50.126 --> 52:50.709
Let's use our
heads for a change.

52:50.710 --> 52:52.252
Okay?

52:52.253 --> 52:53.003
Number one, fucking
fire kills these ants.

52:53.004 --> 52:53.795
All right?

52:53.796 --> 52:55.630
We know that!

52:55.631 --> 52:57.257
Yeah, Danny, and every time
it makes them bigger again.

52:57.258 --> 52:58.508
Why do you have to say that?

52:58.509 --> 53:00.010
Give her break.

53:00.011 --> 53:01.178
She did just witness
the cute black chick

53:01.179 --> 53:03.013
dying in a huge explosion.

53:03.014 --> 53:05.473
Can we please just take a moment
to mourn the loss of my friend?

53:05.474 --> 53:06.558
I just did.

53:06.559 --> 53:07.309
I called her a cute black chick.

53:07.310 --> 53:08.393
Oh my god.

53:08.394 --> 53:09.311
We got to keep moving, guys.

53:09.312 --> 53:10.312
What else do we got?

53:15.109 --> 53:17.319
If we just figure out a way
to communicate with them,

53:17.320 --> 53:18.612
you know?

53:18.613 --> 53:20.280
Babe, you've got
to give it a rest.

53:20.281 --> 53:21.448
Got to give it a rest.

53:21.449 --> 53:22.490
Ho!

53:22.491 --> 53:23.116
Maybe we could use these.

53:23.117 --> 53:24.534
Yeah.

53:24.535 --> 53:25.827
What are you going
to do with those?

53:25.828 --> 53:27.495
You seen the size
of these things?

53:27.496 --> 53:28.538
Extremely flammable, keep
away from open flame.

53:28.539 --> 53:29.247
Yeah.

53:29.248 --> 53:30.165
Bug bombs!

53:30.166 --> 53:31.124
But twice as dangerous.

53:31.125 --> 53:32.542
Death from above.

53:32.543 --> 53:33.835
This is how we get the keys.

53:33.836 --> 53:34.544
Yeah.

53:34.545 --> 53:36.421
What keys?

53:36.422 --> 53:38.715
Your keys that are fucking out
there in the fucking desert.

53:38.716 --> 53:40.383
We throw these up in the air.

53:40.384 --> 53:42.552
Danny shoots them out
the sky with his.38.

53:42.553 --> 53:43.511
Like a cowboy!

53:43.512 --> 53:44.304
We gas those fuckers!

53:44.305 --> 53:44.930
That's right!

53:44.931 --> 53:46.223
Yeah!

53:46.224 --> 53:47.891
And it's going to
fucking explode,

53:47.892 --> 53:48.516
and a cloud of fucking death
is going to rain down...

53:48.517 --> 53:49.559
Yeah!

53:49.560 --> 53:50.644
On these motherfuckers!

53:50.645 --> 53:51.394
And make that fucking show!

53:51.395 --> 53:52.020
Yeah.

53:52.021 --> 53:52.646
Right.

53:52.647 --> 53:53.563
Yeah!

53:53.564 --> 53:54.189
Never make the show!

53:54.190 --> 53:55.565
Yeah!

53:55.566 --> 53:56.191
Am I right?

53:56.192 --> 53:56.816
Yeah!

53:56.817 --> 53:57.442
Yah!

53:57.443 --> 53:58.944
Yeah!

53:58.945 --> 53:59.569
Now that's a plan I
can get my head around.

53:59.570 --> 54:00.362
Yeah!

54:00.363 --> 54:00.987
Rock and roll!

54:00.988 --> 54:01.905
Yeah!

54:01.906 --> 54:02.656
We're going to rock!

54:02.657 --> 54:04.366
1, 2, 3, 4.

54:04.367 --> 54:06.660
And by the way... Let's try it.

54:06.661 --> 54:07.577
I was completely
lying about the herpes.

54:07.578 --> 54:08.161
I don't have herpes.

54:08.162 --> 54:09.204
Okay?

54:09.205 --> 54:10.497
Nobody in this band has...
Herpes.

54:10.498 --> 54:11.498
Herpes.

54:52.790 --> 54:53.915
Where'd they go?

54:53.916 --> 54:55.667
Why are you always so sweaty?

54:55.668 --> 54:57.544
Maybe the explosion
really did it.

54:57.545 --> 54:59.088
Well, I'll be.

55:02.049 --> 55:02.757
Coast is clear.

55:02.758 --> 55:03.675
Yeah.

55:03.676 --> 55:05.176
Let's do this.

55:05.177 --> 55:06.970
All right.

55:06.971 --> 55:08.179
They're coming back.

55:08.180 --> 55:10.015
Always so negative, man.

55:10.016 --> 55:11.308
You know what, Stevie?

55:11.309 --> 55:13.018
The first time I
heard you drum, I

55:13.019 --> 55:14.227
payed you the highest
compliment you can pay a woman.

55:14.228 --> 55:16.146
I said, that chick has balls.

55:16.147 --> 55:17.981
Well, they must've fallen off,
but you better grow them back,

55:17.982 --> 55:19.941
'cause it's time to take
some goddamn chances.

55:19.942 --> 55:20.650
Are you ready?

55:20.651 --> 55:21.568
I'm ready.

55:21.569 --> 55:23.403
Let's do this thing!

55:23.404 --> 55:24.029
Hey!

55:24.030 --> 55:24.738
Easy!

55:24.739 --> 55:26.031
I got it!

55:26.032 --> 55:26.823
Okay.

55:26.824 --> 55:27.532
Okay, let's go.

55:27.533 --> 55:28.325
You ready?

55:28.326 --> 55:29.701
Yeah, 1, 2, 3.

55:33.539 --> 55:34.247
You all right?

55:34.248 --> 55:34.873
Oh my god.

55:34.874 --> 55:35.874
Shit.

55:36.959 --> 55:37.959
Shit.

55:47.345 --> 55:48.845
I've got five bullets left.

55:48.846 --> 55:49.846
All right?

55:55.186 --> 55:56.353
What are we going to do?

55:56.354 --> 55:57.634
These things are
getting in here.

56:02.193 --> 56:03.443
What are we going to do?

56:03.444 --> 56:04.652
We're gonna die!

56:04.653 --> 56:05.570
No, we're not.

56:05.571 --> 56:06.613
We're not going to die.

56:06.614 --> 56:07.864
Now close those curtains.

56:07.865 --> 56:08.823
Okay.

56:08.824 --> 56:09.908
Fold those fucking up.

56:09.909 --> 56:10.992
Let's not let them see us.

56:10.993 --> 56:12.243
We're going dark in here.

56:18.709 --> 56:19.709
Fucker.

56:19.710 --> 56:21.252
Dude.

56:21.253 --> 56:22.545
Hey, you remember when
we did that first album?

56:22.546 --> 56:23.588
Self-titled.

56:23.589 --> 56:24.547
Yeah, everybody hated it.

56:24.548 --> 56:26.299
People hated it They
fucking hated it.

56:26.300 --> 56:28.093
Yeah, so what?

56:28.094 --> 56:30.178
Remember how we had to go
dormant for a little while?

56:30.179 --> 56:32.097
We did.

56:32.098 --> 56:33.538
And then we came
back with fucking...

56:34.183 --> 56:35.183
With fucking rock!

56:35.184 --> 56:36.101
Yeah!

56:36.102 --> 56:37.644
Then everybody loved us?

56:37.645 --> 56:38.603
They did!

56:38.604 --> 56:39.646
And we fucking ruled!

56:39.647 --> 56:41.231
Yes!

56:41.232 --> 56:42.607
Every time we kill one
of these fucking ants,

56:42.608 --> 56:44.025
they come back bigger,
just like that.

56:44.026 --> 56:45.426
But there's that
period of dormancy.

56:45.945 --> 56:47.070
Yes.

56:47.071 --> 56:48.947
That's when we fucking strike!

56:48.948 --> 56:51.533
That period of downtime, that's
when we have to make our move!

56:51.534 --> 56:54.119
So we kill one, and then
they go away for a minute.

56:54.120 --> 56:56.579
We get the hell out of here!

56:58.124 --> 57:01.418
Are you sure it's going to work?

57:01.419 --> 57:03.586
You got any better ideas?

57:09.093 --> 57:10.468
They're taking us!

57:10.469 --> 57:11.428
We're moving!

57:11.429 --> 57:12.429
Ugh!

57:12.430 --> 57:13.430
We're moving!

57:13.431 --> 57:14.889
Okay, everybody calm down.

57:14.890 --> 57:16.349
We got to kill one!

57:16.350 --> 57:17.809
WE got to kill one!

57:17.810 --> 57:18.810
Calm down!

57:21.730 --> 57:27.068
He's taking us to the queen.

57:27.069 --> 57:28.070
She's always hungry.

57:31.115 --> 57:34.827
Yeah, and she's three...

57:44.795 --> 57:45.795
Guys, I got it!

57:45.796 --> 57:46.796
Oh my god.

57:46.797 --> 57:47.797
You got it!

57:51.260 --> 57:52.010
Let's kill it!

57:52.011 --> 57:52.719
Come on!

57:52.720 --> 57:53.470
Let's go!

57:53.471 --> 57:56.222
I got this.

57:56.223 --> 57:58.641
Holy mother of all that's holy.

58:00.144 --> 58:01.102
You make them mad?

58:01.103 --> 58:02.437
I'm trying.

58:02.438 --> 58:03.563
Okay?

58:03.564 --> 58:04.481
Don't waste your bullets, man!

58:04.482 --> 58:05.482
We have three left.

58:05.483 --> 58:06.608
We're fine, buddy.

58:06.609 --> 58:07.525
I don't want to die!

58:07.526 --> 58:08.526
You're not going to die!

58:09.236 --> 58:10.236
I don't want to die!

58:14.825 --> 58:15.909
Get out of my way!

58:15.910 --> 58:17.452
Hey, get the hell out of my way!

58:17.453 --> 58:18.786
Don't make me shoot through you.

58:19.788 --> 58:22.207
Move ahead!

58:22.208 --> 58:23.750
I'm going to shoot
between your legs.

58:23.751 --> 58:24.751
Move!

58:24.919 --> 58:25.919
Ah!

58:32.718 --> 58:33.718
Yeah, dude!

58:39.183 --> 58:40.683
Oh!

58:44.188 --> 58:46.231
Woo!

58:46.232 --> 58:47.357
Did it.

58:48.359 --> 58:49.776
Dead ant.

58:49.777 --> 58:51.194
Dead ant.

58:51.195 --> 58:51.903
Dead ant.

58:51.904 --> 58:52.987
Dead ant!

58:58.369 --> 59:00.286
Danny!

59:00.287 --> 59:01.037
Oh, Danny.

59:01.038 --> 59:01.913
Danny, dude.

59:01.914 --> 59:02.705
Stay with us, man.

59:02.706 --> 59:03.289
Dude, wake up.

59:03.290 --> 59:05.083
Dan.

59:05.084 --> 59:06.084
Get up.

59:09.463 --> 59:12.215
Dead ant!

59:12.216 --> 59:13.258
Fuck you!

59:13.259 --> 59:14.217
Oh, fuck!

59:14.218 --> 59:15.301
My hand is gone!

59:15.302 --> 59:16.553
Oh my god, my hand is gone!

59:16.554 --> 59:17.971
It's bleeding everywhere!

59:17.972 --> 59:19.138
Give me some fucking shirts!

59:19.139 --> 59:20.056
It is gone.

59:20.057 --> 59:21.808
Goddamn it.

59:21.809 --> 59:23.226
This is all you could find?

59:23.227 --> 59:24.894
This is our best tour T-shirt!

59:24.895 --> 59:27.522
We sell these for 25 bucks!

59:27.523 --> 59:29.983
Goddamn it!

59:29.984 --> 59:31.484
My fucking hand!

59:32.194 --> 59:33.194
Oh, shit!

59:34.780 --> 59:36.948
Man, I fucking thought they
were supposed to retreat!

59:43.289 --> 59:44.956
I thought they were
supposed to retreat!

59:44.957 --> 59:46.207
That's what I fucking thought!

59:46.208 --> 59:47.458
Where's the?

59:47.459 --> 59:48.794
Find the!

59:53.924 --> 59:54.924
Stopping.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:09.439
Oh, man!

01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:10.398
Oh!

01:00:10.399 --> 01:00:11.482
This is horrible.

01:00:11.483 --> 01:00:12.860
We got to get of here, man.

01:00:25.581 --> 01:00:27.332
Can you see them?

01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:30.168
You see any hands out there?

01:00:30.169 --> 01:00:32.545
Where are they going?

01:00:32.546 --> 01:00:35.381
Going underground.

01:00:35.382 --> 01:00:36.382
To get bigger.

01:00:38.469 --> 01:00:40.803
Next time you think I'm dead,
don't do that cross thing

01:00:40.804 --> 01:00:41.721
on me.

01:00:41.722 --> 01:00:42.972
I'm Jewish, guys.

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:44.682
Oh, shit!

01:00:44.683 --> 01:00:46.225
How do you not know that?

01:00:46.226 --> 01:00:48.436
Because you always
wear crosses, man.

01:00:48.437 --> 01:00:50.313
Well, those are
fashionable crosses.

01:00:50.314 --> 01:00:51.648
That's right.

01:00:51.649 --> 01:00:52.982
Those aren't the
fucking Jesus cross.

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:54.067
It does look like...

01:00:54.068 --> 01:00:55.818
Yeah.

01:00:55.819 --> 01:00:56.903
I love you.

01:00:56.904 --> 01:00:57.987
Okay, what are we going to do?

01:00:57.988 --> 01:00:58.738
I love you.

01:00:58.739 --> 01:01:00.865
What's the plan?

01:01:00.866 --> 01:01:04.535
Okay, here's the plan.

01:01:04.536 --> 01:01:07.038
Love, you take
Danny and Merrick.

01:01:07.039 --> 01:01:08.706
You get them back to the truck.

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:09.791
How's that cut?

01:01:09.792 --> 01:01:10.708
You're going to be okay?

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:11.501
Uh-huh.

01:01:11.502 --> 01:01:13.002
Okay.

01:01:13.003 --> 01:01:14.796
All right, you're coming
with me and Stevie.

01:01:14.797 --> 01:01:16.673
We're going to find what's
left of Art, get those keys,

01:01:16.674 --> 01:01:18.716
meet you back at the truck,
and we're out of here.

01:01:18.717 --> 01:01:19.509
All right.

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:21.135
Just in case.

01:01:21.136 --> 01:01:25.473
Keep your eyes for a
extra left hand out there.

01:01:25.474 --> 01:01:26.265
Where's the truck?

01:01:26.266 --> 01:01:26.849
Over this way.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:28.017
Come on.

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:28.726
Come on.

01:01:28.727 --> 01:01:30.687
Let's go.

01:01:30.688 --> 01:01:31.270
Okay.

01:01:31.271 --> 01:01:32.063
Ah!

01:01:32.064 --> 01:01:32.939
Oh!

01:01:32.940 --> 01:01:33.940
You got it, buddy.

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:35.274
You got it.

01:01:41.323 --> 01:01:41.906
Get the gate.

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:42.699
Hold on.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:43.616
Get the gate.

01:01:43.617 --> 01:01:44.617
Let's get him in there.

01:01:44.785 --> 01:01:45.785
AH!

01:01:47.454 --> 01:01:48.579
Get him in.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:49.497
Check the cabin for the keys.

01:01:49.498 --> 01:01:50.373
Check for the keys.

01:01:50.374 --> 01:01:51.290
Ow, thanks a lot.

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:52.208
It's fucking Art's bass.

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:52.917
Who needs that?

01:01:52.918 --> 01:01:53.626
Let's go.

01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:54.377
Fuck him.

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:55.712
Let's drive.

01:01:55.713 --> 01:01:56.671
Okay.

01:01:56.672 --> 01:01:57.463
Let's get out of here.

01:01:57.464 --> 01:01:58.464
We got to go!

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:01.259
Let's go, baby.

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:02.218
Okay.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:02.844
Let's get out of here.

01:02:02.845 --> 01:02:03.761
Right.

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:05.304
Got to be somewhere.

01:02:05.305 --> 01:02:06.222
Go to be a piece of him
around here somewhere.

01:02:06.223 --> 01:02:07.932
We got to hurry up!

01:02:07.933 --> 01:02:08.850
Hurry up.

01:02:08.851 --> 01:02:09.934
We got to find him!

01:02:09.935 --> 01:02:11.175
They're coming back any minute.

01:02:12.396 --> 01:02:13.876
We've got to get the
fuck out of here.

01:02:14.356 --> 01:02:15.273
Can't find them.

01:02:15.274 --> 01:02:17.775
Well, keep looking.

01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:20.903
I don't want to die
in this little truck.

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.572
We're not going to
fucking die in this truck.

01:02:22.573 --> 01:02:24.115
We're warriors.

01:02:24.116 --> 01:02:26.951
We made it this far.

01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:30.413
Yeah, that's the kind of
stuff we write songs about.

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:34.751
Yeah, unless we
die in this truck.

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:35.543
What?

01:02:35.544 --> 01:02:36.544
Whatever.

01:02:42.551 --> 01:02:43.968
Got to hurry!

01:02:43.969 --> 01:02:45.179
Find something!

01:02:57.608 --> 01:02:59.066
What is it?

01:02:59.067 --> 01:03:00.777
That sounds like good news.

01:03:00.778 --> 01:03:01.778
Did you find him?

01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:05.782
Oh my god!

01:03:05.783 --> 01:03:06.783
Oh, shit.

01:03:20.130 --> 01:03:20.880
Art.

01:03:20.881 --> 01:03:23.090
Is that him?

01:03:23.091 --> 01:03:24.091
A piece.

01:03:25.052 --> 01:03:25.927
Oh.

01:03:25.928 --> 01:03:26.636
That's disgusting.

01:03:26.637 --> 01:03:27.887
Oh my god.

01:03:27.888 --> 01:03:28.888
Yeah, that's Art's foot.

01:03:28.889 --> 01:03:29.931
It's tiny.

01:03:29.932 --> 01:03:30.807
Oh, man.

01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:31.682
He had small feet.

01:03:31.683 --> 01:03:32.809
Yeah, everything.

01:03:32.810 --> 01:03:33.726
Yeah, well, he had a big dick.

01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:34.811
He had a big dick.

01:03:34.812 --> 01:03:36.092
Hopefully she'll find that next.

01:03:38.857 --> 01:03:40.107
We got to dig him up.

01:03:40.108 --> 01:03:40.817
Come on.

01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:41.859
Let's dig.

01:03:41.860 --> 01:03:43.110
We got to find the shorts.

01:03:43.111 --> 01:03:44.403
I'm going to be sick.

01:03:44.404 --> 01:03:45.154
Come on!

01:03:45.155 --> 01:03:45.738
Get over it!

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:46.531
Dig!

01:03:46.532 --> 01:03:47.281
Get the keys!

01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:48.074
Help us dig!

01:03:48.075 --> 01:03:48.658
Find the keys!

01:03:48.659 --> 01:03:49.367
Come on.

01:03:49.368 --> 01:03:51.035
Find them.

01:03:51.036 --> 01:03:52.203
His calves are big from
carrying all that weight, but...

01:03:52.204 --> 01:03:53.204
Beat.

01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:58.251
God.

01:03:58.252 --> 01:03:59.752
I can't do this.

01:03:59.753 --> 01:04:01.587
You got to get in
the fucking game!

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:02.338
Come on!

01:04:02.339 --> 01:04:03.089
Stevie's right.

01:04:03.090 --> 01:04:03.881
Get in the game.

01:04:03.882 --> 01:04:04.632
Gosh.

01:04:04.633 --> 01:04:05.550
Get over it!

01:04:05.551 --> 01:04:07.176
We got to dig.

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:07.927
Oh, god.

01:04:07.928 --> 01:04:08.886
What's that?

01:04:08.887 --> 01:04:09.637
I feel something here.

01:04:09.638 --> 01:04:12.098
Yeah.

01:04:12.099 --> 01:04:13.182
Aw, it's smushy.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:15.059
Ah, there's something here.

01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.519
Oh, it's his pelvis.

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:19.522
Oh my god.

01:04:20.524 --> 01:04:22.984
Move it to the side.

01:04:22.985 --> 01:04:24.944
See, that was really bad!

01:04:25.946 --> 01:04:27.405
Okay, keep going.

01:04:27.406 --> 01:04:28.489
Keep going!

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:29.782
His shorts got to be down here.

01:04:32.536 --> 01:04:33.619
Is that the shorts?

01:04:33.620 --> 01:04:34.537
It's the shorts.

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:37.164
Where's the pocket?

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:37.915
Nothing.

01:04:37.916 --> 01:04:39.458
Wait, you guys!

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:41.294
I feel something.

01:04:41.295 --> 01:04:42.753
You see that?

01:04:42.754 --> 01:04:43.838
It's right here.

01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:46.883
Where the fuck...
I feel... oh my god.

01:04:46.884 --> 01:04:48.467
I can't fit my hand through.

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:49.927
Stevie, see if you can
fit your hand through.

01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:51.053
Oh, god.

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:51.804
Stick it in there.

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:53.556
Hurry up.

01:04:53.557 --> 01:04:55.141
Go on.

01:04:55.142 --> 01:04:56.309
Okay.

01:04:56.310 --> 01:04:57.310
Oh, god.

01:05:02.024 --> 01:05:02.732
Oh, god.

01:05:02.733 --> 01:05:04.609
That's it.

01:05:04.610 --> 01:05:06.235
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:05:06.236 --> 01:05:07.236
Oh.

01:05:09.281 --> 01:05:10.531
Hurry.

01:05:10.532 --> 01:05:12.909
Hurry.

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:15.870
It's deep.

01:05:15.871 --> 01:05:17.371
I can't reach it, man!

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:18.331
Come on, guys.

01:05:18.332 --> 01:05:19.999
Go get it.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.792
You guys, what if the
ant's coming through here?

01:05:21.793 --> 01:05:22.793
Hurry up!

01:05:22.794 --> 01:05:23.794
Go, Stevie!

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:26.130
I'm going deep.

01:05:26.131 --> 01:05:27.173
We got to hurry!

01:05:27.174 --> 01:05:28.716
Almost there.

01:05:29.426 --> 01:05:31.177
I got it!

01:05:31.178 --> 01:05:32.678
Shorts.

01:05:32.679 --> 01:05:33.638
Oh.

01:05:33.639 --> 01:05:34.639
Ugh.

01:05:35.641 --> 01:05:37.099
We found the keys!

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:37.808
Go!

01:05:37.809 --> 01:05:38.392
Let's go!

01:05:38.393 --> 01:05:39.018
Come on!

01:05:39.019 --> 01:05:40.394
Hurry!

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:42.063
We got they keys!

01:05:42.064 --> 01:05:42.813
We found them!

01:05:42.814 --> 01:05:43.439
We got the keys!

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.440
What?

01:05:44.608 --> 01:05:45.316
Yes!

01:05:45.317 --> 01:05:45.900
Thank god!

01:05:45.901 --> 01:05:46.609
Come on!

01:05:46.610 --> 01:05:48.027
All right!

01:05:48.028 --> 01:05:48.819
Yeah, we'll write
a son about... ow!

01:05:48.820 --> 01:05:50.321
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:05:56.954 --> 01:05:57.745
Oh my god!

01:05:57.746 --> 01:05:59.622
Oh, no!

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:00.665
Fuck!

01:06:00.666 --> 01:06:01.499
Keep coming with the keys.

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:02.500
Forget her!

01:06:02.501 --> 01:06:06.462
No!

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:08.130
Only the good die young.

01:06:08.131 --> 01:06:10.424
Hurry up!

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:11.092
Focus!

01:06:11.093 --> 01:06:12.051
Hurry!

01:06:12.052 --> 01:06:13.469
Come on!

01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:14.220
Let's get here!

01:06:14.221 --> 01:06:15.429
Hurry!

01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:16.180
Come on!

01:06:16.181 --> 01:06:16.764
Save yourselves!

01:06:16.765 --> 01:06:17.390
Come on!

01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:18.099
Keys!

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.392
Hurry up!

01:06:19.393 --> 01:06:20.351
Go.

01:06:20.352 --> 01:06:21.852
Let's go, go, go, go.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.315
Come on!

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:29.276
Oh, get it going!

01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:31.278
Go!

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:33.030
Go!

01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:33.614
They're coming!

01:06:33.615 --> 01:06:35.282
Go!

01:06:35.283 --> 01:06:39.745
1, a 2... a 1, 2, 3, 4!

01:06:39.746 --> 01:06:44.250
Go!

01:06:57.222 --> 01:06:58.598
We're going the wrong way!

01:07:02.686 --> 01:07:03.769
Hey.

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:04.687
Hey, we're going the wrong way!

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:06.188
Going the wrong way!

01:07:06.189 --> 01:07:06.897
Stevie!

01:07:06.898 --> 01:07:07.690
Oh, shit!

01:07:07.691 --> 01:07:08.691
Holy shit.

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:11.193
That shit is fast.

01:07:11.194 --> 01:07:12.571
Go, faster, faster!

01:07:15.699 --> 01:07:17.491
Look at how big they are!

01:07:17.492 --> 01:07:19.702
They're coming at us like
an angry herd of Corvettes!

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:21.038
Those are good cars, though.

01:07:24.166 --> 01:07:26.667
Go faster!

01:07:26.668 --> 01:07:29.670
I'm trying!

01:07:31.923 --> 01:07:34.300
If this wasn't so scary,
it would be awesome.

01:07:38.555 --> 01:07:39.138
Fuck!

01:07:39.139 --> 01:07:40.556
Come on!

01:07:40.557 --> 01:07:43.559
Fucking...

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.185
Go!

01:07:44.186 --> 01:07:44.935
Shit!

01:07:44.936 --> 01:07:46.062
Here comes one!

01:07:46.063 --> 01:07:49.565
That one's coming up fast!

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:50.524
Oh, shit!

01:07:50.525 --> 01:07:51.275
Do something!

01:07:51.276 --> 01:07:53.069
He's coming!

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:57.573
Oh, shit!

01:07:59.076 --> 01:08:01.535
No, give me the axe!

01:08:01.536 --> 01:08:04.538
Give me the axe!

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:06.040
Get it, Pager!

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:09.043
Oh, Jesus!

01:08:09.044 --> 01:08:10.044
Ha-ha!

01:08:10.295 --> 01:08:11.545
Yeah!

01:08:11.546 --> 01:08:13.506
Yeah!

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:17.009
Get him!

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:29.522
Give me the spray!

01:08:29.523 --> 01:08:30.981
Do we still got that can?

01:08:30.982 --> 01:08:32.942
You got it, buddy!

01:08:35.946 --> 01:08:37.446
Yeah, in your eyes!

01:08:37.447 --> 01:08:38.447
In your eyes!

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:39.448
Die, motherfucker!

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:40.448
Get him, Pager!

01:08:40.450 --> 01:08:41.450
Kick it!

01:08:41.451 --> 01:08:42.701
Yeah!

01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:43.953
Yeah!

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:48.457
Yeah!

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:49.959
Fuck you, ant!

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:51.460
Fuck you!

01:08:51.461 --> 01:08:53.462
They're still fucking coming!

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:56.298
Ha!

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:58.618
La, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la!

01:09:07.394 --> 01:09:09.645
I've never seen so many.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:10.895
Assholes?

01:09:10.897 --> 01:09:12.689
Ants.

01:09:12.691 --> 01:09:15.651
They're leading them
to the festival.

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:17.778
Well, we got to get down
there and warn them.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:18.779
Let's go.

01:09:35.755 --> 01:09:37.131
You're a rad driver.

01:09:40.218 --> 01:09:41.595
Don't even think about it.

01:09:48.727 --> 01:09:51.187
Give us a break.

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.691
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:56.692
Go!

01:10:05.202 --> 01:10:07.703
Go, go, go!

01:10:07.704 --> 01:10:08.704
Fuck.

01:10:11.666 --> 01:10:14.668
They're coming!

01:10:20.675 --> 01:10:22.010
Go, go, go!

01:11:01.549 --> 01:11:04.093
Whoa, whoa, whoa... can't let
you go through with that, chief.

01:11:04.094 --> 01:11:05.261
You're in a lot of danger.

01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:07.429
We need to evacuate this place.

01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:09.932
Okay, stop with the crazy talk.

01:11:09.933 --> 01:11:11.433
Hand over the weapon.

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:12.559
Then we can go play
cowboys and Indians.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.644
How about that, huh?

01:11:13.645 --> 01:11:15.479
Is that a racial slur, asshole?

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:18.190
Oh, you do not
want a piece of us.

01:11:18.191 --> 01:11:20.067
Hand that over too, big fella.

01:11:20.068 --> 01:11:21.652
I'm not handing it.

01:11:21.653 --> 01:11:23.487
I'm stuffing it.

01:11:23.488 --> 01:11:26.532
You got about two minutes before
1,000 ants come over that ridge

01:11:26.533 --> 01:11:28.158
and kill every
single one of you.

01:11:29.828 --> 01:11:31.996
Okay, I'm not sure what
peace pipe you're smoking.

01:11:31.997 --> 01:11:35.791
But if you don't hand over the
weapon, I'm going to take it.

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:37.835
Forcefully.

01:11:37.836 --> 01:11:40.713
Don't threaten him with
a good time, or me.

01:11:41.589 --> 01:11:42.423
Whoa, back it up.

01:11:42.424 --> 01:11:43.465
Back it up.

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:44.341
Oh, it's going to happen.

01:11:44.342 --> 01:11:45.301
It's not going to.

01:11:45.302 --> 01:11:46.176
Put the dynamite away.

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:47.386
Just turn around.

01:11:47.387 --> 01:11:48.137
That's it!

01:11:48.138 --> 01:11:48.846
Give me it!

01:11:48.847 --> 01:11:49.555
That's it!

01:11:49.556 --> 01:11:50.556
Oh my god!

01:11:54.352 --> 01:11:56.688
Don't close your eyes.

01:12:00.817 --> 01:12:03.111
Don't close your eyes.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:11.077
Don't sing your last lullaby.

01:12:20.170 --> 01:12:22.129
Don't close your eyes.

01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:24.131
It's the festival!

01:12:24.132 --> 01:12:26.091
Yes!

01:12:26.092 --> 01:12:28.052
Nochella!

01:12:29.554 --> 01:12:30.554
Fuck yeah!

01:12:30.555 --> 01:12:33.015
It's the festival!

01:12:33.016 --> 01:12:37.354
Don't sing your last lullaby.

01:12:49.908 --> 01:12:51.950
You have one minute to live.

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:54.370
Okay, buddy.

01:12:54.371 --> 01:12:55.746
Look, you get to see this.

01:13:01.711 --> 01:13:03.212
It's them.

01:13:05.215 --> 01:13:06.673
I've got to get to the PA

01:13:06.674 --> 01:13:09.635
system.

01:13:20.563 --> 01:13:21.939
Stevie, get to the main stage.

01:13:21.940 --> 01:13:23.065
Warn everyone you can.

01:13:23.066 --> 01:13:24.274
We're right behind you.

01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:25.150
Okay.

01:13:25.151 --> 01:13:26.402
You.

01:13:26.403 --> 01:13:28.529
You led them here.

01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:29.905
Your band sucks.

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:33.325
You disgraced my
land and my people.

01:13:33.326 --> 01:13:36.787
I'm sorry.

01:13:36.788 --> 01:13:39.289
You will be.

01:13:39.290 --> 01:13:40.290
Okay.

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:41.291
Where are we going?

01:13:41.292 --> 01:13:42.876
To the main stage.

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:43.752
I bet they have a band
bunker underneath it.

01:13:43.753 --> 01:13:45.462
Look at our sign... Oh, god.

01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:46.046
Right next to the shitters.

01:13:46.047 --> 01:13:47.047
We suck.

01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:01.061
Come on!

01:14:04.941 --> 01:14:05.691
We got to go!

01:14:05.692 --> 01:14:06.859
We go to go!

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:16.410
I need to get on the mic!

01:14:16.411 --> 01:14:17.411
Hey, what are you doing?

01:14:17.412 --> 01:14:18.954
Put me on the PA!

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:21.790
Ladies and gentlemen...
Hey... it's not working!

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:23.292
Weird!

01:14:23.293 --> 01:14:25.128
You guys are in a lot of danger.

01:14:29.215 --> 01:14:30.340
Wait up!

01:14:30.341 --> 01:14:31.593
Oh, no, they got to warn them.

01:14:41.603 --> 01:14:42.603
Okay, everybody.

01:14:42.604 --> 01:14:44.062
That was Stereoblasters.

01:14:44.063 --> 01:14:45.147
Let's hear it for them.

01:14:45.148 --> 01:14:47.065
We can't hear you... microphone!

01:14:47.066 --> 01:14:50.068
Now we're going to have
a 10-minute intermission,

01:14:50.069 --> 01:14:52.946
and then we're going to
have Sonic Grave performing,

01:14:54.449 --> 01:14:55.949
Run!

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:24.269
Come on, babe.

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:26.480
If we don't make it, I...

01:15:26.481 --> 01:15:29.024
I just... I need you to know...
I know.

01:15:40.411 --> 01:15:41.411
Oh, shit!

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:52.339
Oh, shit!

01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:55.801
Not my first fucking concert!

01:15:55.802 --> 01:15:58.262
I can't die on the
fucking shitter!

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:22.578
Oh.

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:27.583
Oh, fuck.

01:16:27.584 --> 01:16:29.793
Want a sip?

01:16:29.794 --> 01:16:32.671
Oh, fuck that!

01:16:33.631 --> 01:16:34.756
I'm not going to die.

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:36.758
You're not going to die!

01:16:36.759 --> 01:16:39.761
I got a song to sing, and
I'm going to go save us.

01:16:39.762 --> 01:16:40.762
No!

01:16:43.766 --> 01:16:44.766
Pager!

01:16:44.767 --> 01:16:45.517
Stevie!

01:16:45.518 --> 01:16:46.518
Don't leave me!

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:51.898
Ah!

01:16:51.899 --> 01:16:52.774
Pager!

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:53.775
Stevie!

01:18:03.096 --> 01:18:05.473
Come on, start a fire.

01:18:19.070 --> 01:18:23.073
Baby, cross my wires.

01:18:25.243 --> 01:18:28.829
Light up my hair.

01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:33.333
Overload my circuits.

01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:36.795
Let me feel the juice.

01:18:38.131 --> 01:18:42.759
Make me an offer
that I can't refuse.

01:18:42.760 --> 01:18:43.760
Blow my fuse.

01:18:47.724 --> 01:18:50.225
You got nothing to lose.

01:18:50.226 --> 01:18:52.227
Blow my fuse.

01:18:53.146 --> 01:18:55.230
I need a good shot.

01:18:55.231 --> 01:19:01.695
I can't give it to you
on electric cruise.

01:19:01.696 --> 01:19:04.197
Blow my fuse.

01:19:05.116 --> 01:19:06.199
You light my light.

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.160
I'll light you.

01:19:08.161 --> 01:19:12.664
Baby, shake my tower.

01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:16.126
Get it while it's hot.

01:19:16.127 --> 01:19:22.591
Baby, feel my
power, 50,000 watts.

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:31.099
Come on, feel the voltage,
light thick and through,

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:37.063
from the whites of my eyeballs
to the soles of my shoes.

01:19:37.857 --> 01:19:40.568
Blow my fuse.

01:19:42.028 --> 01:19:44.529
You got nothing to lose.

01:19:44.530 --> 01:19:47.032
Blow my fuse.

01:19:47.033 --> 01:19:49.993
I need a good shot.

01:19:49.994 --> 01:19:54.956
I can't give it to you
on electric cruise.

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:57.335
Blow my fuse.

01:20:24.862 --> 01:20:25.862
Cool!

01:20:26.864 --> 01:20:28.323
Fuck yeah!

01:20:30.827 --> 01:20:31.827
Yeah!

01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:34.830
Ah!

01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:35.831
Fuck!

01:20:35.832 --> 01:20:39.334
Oh my god!

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:40.335
You killed it.

01:20:40.336 --> 01:20:42.796
Fucking A.

01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:57.853
It was a hot summer's night.

01:20:57.854 --> 01:21:00.188
She was sweating all over.

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:04.276
She went to the fridge
for a ch-ch-cherry cola.

01:21:04.277 --> 01:21:07.988
I said, hey, girl, I
want to get to know you.

01:21:07.989 --> 01:21:11.825
I can almost see your areola.

01:21:11.826 --> 01:21:16.037
She wore a rock-and-roll
tee cut up on the side.

01:21:16.038 --> 01:21:20.041
It was only in the front
that she bothered to hide.

01:21:20.042 --> 01:21:24.379
She moved to her left,
so I peeked to my right.

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:27.883
Oh my Lord, it's such
a wonderful sight.

01:21:27.884 --> 01:21:32.345
It's a side boob,
naked and free.

01:21:32.346 --> 01:21:36.808
Side boob, staring back at me.

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:42.272
Side boob, like a D-cup K.
That sugar's sweet, baby,

01:21:42.273 --> 01:21:44.232
I could eat all day.

01:21:44.233 --> 01:21:45.233
Yeah.

01:21:51.741 --> 01:21:55.952
I see it from the side,
and I like the slope.

01:21:55.953 --> 01:21:57.537
Oh, yeah.

01:21:57.538 --> 01:22:00.624
Creamy hot and butter
on my breakfast toast.

01:22:00.625 --> 01:22:02.751
Start my engine, baby.

01:22:02.752 --> 01:22:03.960
Pull my choke.

01:22:03.961 --> 01:22:05.754
I got a full tank of gas.

01:22:05.755 --> 01:22:08.173
I want to motorboat.

01:22:08.174 --> 01:22:12.052
I come a long hard road
many country miles.

01:22:12.053 --> 01:22:14.429
I've seen a lot of
tour groupies, nothing

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:16.097
like your style.

01:22:16.098 --> 01:22:20.143
I want to rendezvous, don't
need the number to dial.

01:22:20.144 --> 01:22:24.940
Spin halfway around so I can
see your profile on your side

01:22:24.941 --> 01:22:28.860
boob, baby, naked and free.

01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:32.447
Side boob, staring back at me.

01:22:32.448 --> 01:22:38.161
Side boob, you're like a D-cup
K. That sugar's sweet, baby.

01:22:38.162 --> 01:22:40.080
I could eat all day.

01:22:40.081 --> 01:22:41.081
Yeah.

01:22:55.846 --> 01:23:00.642
Was it an A, B, C tucked
underneath the tee?

01:23:00.643 --> 01:23:02.143
Size don't matter, baby.

01:23:02.144 --> 01:23:04.562
It ain't important to me.

01:23:04.563 --> 01:23:08.483
What can I do to set them free?

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:12.070
I know that there's a
present waiting just for me.

01:23:12.071 --> 01:23:16.866
And it's a side boob,
baby, naked and free.

01:23:16.867 --> 01:23:20.453
Side boob, staring back at me.

01:23:20.454 --> 01:23:26.167
Side boob, baby, D-cup
K. Side boob, baby,

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:27.961
make it just for me.

01:23:27.962 --> 01:23:32.465
I said side boob,
don't matter the size.

01:23:32.466 --> 01:23:36.678
Side boob, baby, they're
bigger than mine.

01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:40.557
Side boob, I can't
see nothing else.

01:23:40.558 --> 01:23:44.561
Side boob, baby, got
me screaming for help.

01:23:44.562 --> 01:23:45.562
Ah!
