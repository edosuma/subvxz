WEBVTT

04:02.409 --> 04:03.444
Too damn bad.

19:37.218 --> 19:39.550
And you...
Don't do anything dim-witted.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.976
That was hours ago.

25:27.317 --> 25:28.853
It's a very absurd choice.
We cannot rely on him.

25:31.155 --> 25:33.897
I would trust Lord Broch
Tuarach with my life.

25:43.667 --> 25:44.873
Some of my men have been
stricken down by --

25:52.051 --> 25:53.132
Perhaps.

25:57.014 --> 25:59.005
We have the affected men hidden away

25:59.099 --> 26:01.181
for now,
but they will soon be missed.

26:05.814 --> 26:07.896
The man's too scrupulous for that.

26:25.167 --> 26:27.955
I warned you that he would try to
gouge us for an exorbitant fee!

26:35.260 --> 26:37.251
Be that as it may, I don't trust him.

26:38.472 --> 26:40.463
He has ruined me once before.

27:30.941 --> 27:32.852
I will, of course, accompany
you on the journey...

27:33.777 --> 27:35.484
...along with The Almighty...

27:37.739 --> 27:39.650
...to watch over my investment.

31:32.432 --> 31:34.514
And of course, the Baron could
not rise to the occasion.

31:35.227 --> 31:37.389
His mistress feigned entry
with every thrust.

31:39.731 --> 31:42.598
With the Baroness looking like a
well-groomed hippopotamus...

31:44.778 --> 31:47.440
...it's a wonder her husband
comes home at all.

31:49.991 --> 31:51.026
It's revolting.

32:25.610 --> 32:26.645
Come on, hurry!

32:26.736 --> 32:27.771
Don't move!

32:28.655 --> 32:29.690
Drop this at once!

32:30.407 --> 32:31.488
Don't stop!

32:32.033 --> 32:33.774
'DFQP your weapons!
- Keep moving!

32:33.869 --> 32:34.904
We want that cargo!

32:36.746 --> 32:37.781
Hurry, hurry!

32:37.873 --> 32:38.908
Come down!

32:38.999 --> 32:40.034
I said, keep moving!

32:41.418 --> 32:42.783
- Come down!
- Get down!

32:45.839 --> 32:46.874
Now!

32:47.340 --> 32:48.455
Don't move!

32:48.550 --> 32:49.585
Drop your weapons!

32:52.971 --> 32:54.211
Do as we say,

32:54.306 --> 32:55.762
and you'll not be harmed.

32:55.849 --> 32:58.557
Your lives are not worth
a consignment.

33:00.437 --> 33:01.472
Get down!

33:05.775 --> 33:07.311
You will be hunted and hanged.

33:08.278 --> 33:09.939
Not likely. Get down.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.117
- Get down!
- Never.

33:20.707 --> 33:21.742
NEVER!

33:32.511 --> 33:33.546
Let me go!

33:35.805 --> 33:36.840
Let me go!

33:41.102 --> 33:42.137
Do you have any idea...

33:42.729 --> 33:44.436
...any <i>idea</i> from whom
you are stealing?

33:45.106 --> 33:46.312
Let go of me!

33:47.817 --> 33:48.852
He's sleeping with the maid.

33:50.403 --> 33:52.314
Yes, but she sleeps with the cook.

33:53.740 --> 33:55.606
The one with the big mouth
and the small eyes.

33:56.326 --> 33:57.361
So, it's only fair.

33:57.786 --> 34:00.073
- How scandalous.
- Yes. It is disgusting.

34:00.580 --> 34:01.615
HovvjuicY-

34:02.749 --> 34:04.239
She told me all the details.

34:04.668 --> 34:06.659
How it all started,
behind the fireplace...

34:08.338 --> 34:09.703
...she was nibbling on sweets...

34:10.674 --> 34:13.257
...and on the chicken thigh
while he was chewing on her ear!

34:51.089 --> 34:52.204
You are so very right.

34:52.799 --> 34:54.289
We should do something
about these people.

34:55.135 --> 34:56.466
It is far too upsetting.

34:57.345 --> 35:00.804
We should have our husbands
protest to The King.

35:01.308 --> 35:02.719
Yes, yes, yes, I completely agree.

35:36.092 --> 35:37.173
She's rather sensitive.

35:41.890 --> 35:43.722
I'll tell you more about the cook.

37:52.395 --> 37:53.977
It boggles...

37:54.939 --> 37:56.850
The thieves knew our route.

38:00.236 --> 38:02.728
True, but their timing
was impeccable.

38:03.114 --> 38:07.108
An ambush is to lie in wait?

38:08.244 --> 38:10.235
A Les Disciple practise, no?

38:12.040 --> 38:15.533
But that road, at that precise
time, with our cargo?

38:19.422 --> 38:20.457
Hey, you.

38:21.925 --> 38:23.006
Hey, you!

38:24.719 --> 38:27.256
Yes, You.
You allege mere coincidence?

38:34.312 --> 38:36.303
I remind you, I am of noble blood.

42:30.381 --> 42:31.621
Wait for me here.

46:05.721 --> 46:07.803
Quickly! Prepare the carriage!

46:07.890 --> 46:09.255
Get the horses!

47:11.662 --> 47:12.697
Hurry!

47:14.707 --> 47:15.742
Hurry!

49:49.653 --> 49:53.237
Gentlemen!
Drop you swords immediately!

49:53.324 --> 49:55.235
Do not move! You are under arrest!

50:00.206 --> 50:01.367
Drop your sword!

50:02.917 --> 50:03.952
Drop it at once!

50:05.711 --> 50:07.122
In the name of The King,
drop your weapon!

50:14.803 --> 50:16.339
Stay there! Do not move!
