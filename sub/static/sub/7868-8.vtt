[playing theme on piano...]

00:11.316 --> 00:17.421
[band playing theme...]

00:17.488 --> 00:20.957
It was so, at the time, insanely edgy.

00:21.025 --> 00:23.360
[theme continues...]

00:23.428 --> 00:26.797
That show was a huge, huge influence.

00:26.864 --> 00:32.569
[playing theme...]

00:32.637 --> 00:36.139
Springfield is a magical land
that's built for comedy writers.

00:36.207 --> 00:41.945
[tejano band playing theme...]

00:42.013 --> 00:44.014
<i>The simpsons actually made my career.</i>

00:44.082 --> 00:45.449
...This isn't about show business.

00:45.516 --> 00:46.350
It's not the traditional liberal,

00:46.417 --> 00:49.619
Politically correct family,

00:49.687 --> 00:51.221
But how dull would that be?

00:51.289 --> 00:52.322
...Hoo-hoo!

00:52.390 --> 00:55.125
[band continues theme...]

00:55.193 --> 00:57.861
[hip-hop version of theme...]

00:57.929 --> 00:59.496
It's hard not to love homer.

00:59.564 --> 01:01.164
My favorite character is probably ralph.

01:01.232 --> 01:02.733
I just can't say enough about brockman.

01:02.800 --> 01:05.669
[hip-hop scratching]

01:05.737 --> 01:06.536
I'd hire him.

[jug band version of theme...]

01:08.106 --> 01:09.873
[horn honks]

01:09.941 --> 01:11.241
To see something like this

01:11.309 --> 01:14.611
Just rise out of the manure
pile that was animation

01:14.679 --> 01:16.480
Was just... Pretty amazing.

01:16.547 --> 01:19.216
[theme on kazoos...]

[humming theme...]

01:24.322 --> 01:29.860
[rock version of theme, crowd cheering...]

01:29.927 --> 01:33.697
If you want to be considered one
of the great writers in comedy,

01:33.765 --> 01:36.900
<i>You kind of have to take a little
tour through the simpsons.</i>

01:36.968 --> 01:40.036
[theme continues, crowd cheering]

01:40.104 --> 01:45.475
[jazz/rock version of theme...]

01:45.543 --> 01:49.546
[indian version of theme...[

01:49.614 --> 01:51.415
Marge is one of a kind...

01:51.482 --> 01:52.249
In many ways.

01:52.316 --> 01:54.684
I never saw marge in that way.

01:54.752 --> 01:59.756
I never looked at her as a sex object.

01:59.824 --> 02:00.857
I do now.

02:00.925 --> 02:04.728
[playing theme on bass...]

02:04.796 --> 02:06.229
<i>It's almost like if you like the
simpsons...</i>

02:06.297 --> 02:07.998
It's like somebody liking dogs.

02:08.065 --> 02:09.733
You gotta be a little
distrustful of someone...

02:09.800 --> 02:11.101
"I hate dogs."

02:11.169 --> 02:12.436
How could you [bleeping] hate a dog?

02:12.503 --> 02:15.939
[continues theme on bass...]

02:16.007 --> 02:17.407
[theme ends]

02:17.475 --> 02:19.509
Hi, I'm morgan spurlock.

02:19.577 --> 02:21.211
When fox asked me to make a special

02:21.279 --> 02:23.313
<i>Celebrating the simpsons' 20th
anniversary,</i>

02:23.381 --> 02:26.283
<i>Like any good simpsons geek, I immediately
said yes.</i>

02:26.350 --> 02:28.552
...But then I realized
how far I'd have to go

02:28.619 --> 02:30.687
And how much ground I'd have to cover.

02:30.755 --> 02:35.058
In an attempt to understand the
epidemic spread of yellow fever,

02:35.126 --> 02:37.694
I'm gonna take you around the
country and across the globe

02:37.762 --> 02:40.063
To find out why this show
has become both the cash cow

02:40.131 --> 02:43.667
And sacred golden entertainment
calf worshipped by the entire world.

02:43.734 --> 02:45.502
<i>My dad loves the simpsons.
I love the simpsons.</i>

02:45.570 --> 02:47.103
Spurlock: I'll hear from the people

02:47.171 --> 02:49.339
On the front lines of obsessive fandom...

02:49.407 --> 02:51.208
If it says "the simpsons" on it,
I have to have it.

02:51.275 --> 02:53.543
Explore how the simpsons have
undermined america's status

02:53.611 --> 02:55.579
As the most beloved country in the world...

02:57.415 --> 03:01.051
And discover how the show has
touched the lives of millions.

03:01.118 --> 03:04.488
<i>This is the simpsons 20th
anniversary special--</i>

03:04.555 --> 03:06.256
<i>In 3d!</i>

03:06.324 --> 03:08.859
<i>On ice!</i>

03:08.926 --> 03:10.393
It all started 22 years ago,

03:10.461 --> 03:12.529
When a young cartoonist by
the name of matt groening

03:12.597 --> 03:15.432
Was summoned to the altar of
hollywood legend, mister jim brooks.

03:15.500 --> 03:16.933
[harp trill from theme]

03:17.001 --> 03:20.203
I had been an underground
cartoonist for 10 years

03:20.271 --> 03:22.072
Before I got the hollywood call.

03:22.139 --> 03:24.140
It was about time! [laughs]

03:24.208 --> 03:25.942
I had finished my first movie,

03:26.010 --> 03:29.946
And as a gift, somebody I
was working with gave me

03:30.014 --> 03:34.184
<i>A framed copy of one of matt's life in hell
cartoons,</i>

03:34.252 --> 03:36.453
And it was "the 12 ways
to die in los angeles"

03:36.521 --> 03:39.022
And the last two was "
failure" and "success."

03:39.090 --> 03:41.324
And I just loved it and hung it up.

03:41.392 --> 03:43.393
<i>The thought was on the
tracey ullman show</i>

03:43.461 --> 03:46.296
To have our bumpers be
actually entertainment things,

03:46.364 --> 03:48.965
And we decided to do cartoons,
and I thought of matt right away.

03:49.033 --> 03:50.433
I got called into the office.

03:50.501 --> 03:54.170
While I was waiting, I found out that maybe

03:54.238 --> 03:58.542
Whatever I did, in this fledgling network,
I was gonna lose control of.

03:58.609 --> 04:01.711
<i>And I thought, I've got my comic strip,
life in hell.</i>

04:01.779 --> 04:03.647
That's what I was gonna do.

04:03.714 --> 04:06.116
I said, "forget that,
I gotta save the bunnies for myself."

04:06.183 --> 04:09.519
So I made up new characters on the spot,
I drew the simpsons,

04:09.587 --> 04:13.423
Named them after my own family,
because that's a whole other psychodrama

04:13.491 --> 04:15.125
And... The rest is history.

04:15.192 --> 04:16.293
[whoosh]

04:16.360 --> 04:17.827
Homer: There's nothing to worry about.

04:17.894 --> 04:20.329
Now everyone go to sleep.

04:20.398 --> 04:23.400
Dan castellaneta and I were there,

04:23.467 --> 04:26.670
And then they hired nancy
cartwright and yeardley smith

04:26.737 --> 04:28.605
To play the two kids,

04:28.673 --> 04:32.108
And lucky me, I think
tracey was too tired...

04:32.176 --> 04:33.543
"tracey, you're busy rehearsing,"

04:33.611 --> 04:35.478
'cause I was pretty much in everything,

04:35.546 --> 04:36.947
"so julie, dan,

04:37.014 --> 04:38.949
Would you come up to the
booth and do these voices?"

04:39.016 --> 04:40.917
I read for bart,
and that was fairly short-lived,

04:40.985 --> 04:42.419
And then they said,

04:42.486 --> 04:45.322
"here's a picture of his
sister lisa-- she's eight."

04:45.389 --> 04:48.992
So I went up... [higher voice]:
Like that, to lisa simpson.

04:49.060 --> 04:51.861
It was just matt groening and me,
and I went in and I said,

04:51.929 --> 04:54.364
"hey, do you mind...
I was here to read for the girl,

04:54.432 --> 04:57.100
But do you mind if I read for bart?"

04:57.168 --> 04:58.401
[as bart]: "blah blah blah blah blah...."

04:58.469 --> 04:59.970
"oh, my god, that's him, that's bart!"

05:00.037 --> 05:02.172
Hired me on the spot. [snaps fingers]

05:02.239 --> 05:04.741
[as bart]: Behold! Neanderthal man!

05:04.809 --> 05:09.212
Fox approached jim brooks about doing
these little, short simpsons cartoons

05:09.280 --> 05:11.481
As a tv special.

05:11.549 --> 05:15.485
I talked to him and I said, "no, no,
no, we gotta do a whole series."

05:15.553 --> 05:19.322
They committed what for them was
an enormous amount of money,

05:19.390 --> 05:21.358
You know, because they were almost broke.

05:21.425 --> 05:26.196
There had not been a primetime animated
series on television for a generation,

05:26.263 --> 05:28.898
And it was considered a risky thing to do.

05:28.966 --> 05:31.234
I took the job here, I had fun,

05:31.302 --> 05:33.436
But I didn't tell anyone what I was doing,

05:33.504 --> 05:36.272
'cause I thought, "I've really
hit rock bottom." [laughs]

05:36.340 --> 05:38.074
Sam simon called me and said,
"we want to make you

05:38.142 --> 05:40.477
A regular on the show," and I said, "no."

05:40.544 --> 05:43.346
I used to say, "hey, guys,
we're 13 and out."

05:43.414 --> 05:45.248
Like, "they're only gonna let us do 13,

05:45.316 --> 05:47.784
We'll do 13, we'll have fun,
and then we're gone."

05:47.852 --> 05:51.554
Maybe these 13 episodes
will be like a cult...

05:51.622 --> 05:53.423
It will be a cult following.

05:53.491 --> 05:57.894
The show premiered as the highes
t-rated show in the history of fox.

05:57.962 --> 06:01.998
<i>I remember a headline-- a headline!-- On
the front page of the new york post...</i>

06:02.066 --> 06:05.001
Owned by the same person who
owns the simpsons... [laughs]

06:05.069 --> 06:09.272
<i>That said, "simpsons beats cosby," then the
number one show in the country.</i>

06:09.340 --> 06:12.442
I'll never be in the beatles,
I assume, but... [laughs]

06:12.510 --> 06:15.645
It's the closest thing I could
ever imagine to that happening,

06:15.713 --> 06:17.714
Where....When this show came on the air,

06:17.782 --> 06:19.716
I couldn't believe how
much attention it got.

06:19.784 --> 06:22.819
I think it's been the most
successful spin-off... Ever.

06:22.887 --> 06:24.554
[rhythmic drum beat...]

06:24.622 --> 06:27.090
Spurlock: But it's a lot
more than just a spin-off.

06:27.158 --> 06:28.992
<i>The simpsons is an award-winning,
record-breaking machine</i>

06:29.060 --> 06:32.028
That has shattered
expectations at every turn.

06:32.096 --> 06:35.799
And now, it's the longes
t-running primetime show on television,

06:35.866 --> 06:38.902
<i>Even passing both gunsmoke and the
adventures of ozzie and harriet.</i>

06:38.969 --> 06:41.037
Well, if you ask me,
that's a little too fast.

06:41.105 --> 06:45.208
Spurlock: It's won 25 emmys,
26 annies, six genesis awards,

06:45.276 --> 06:48.344
Six writers guild of america awards,
four people's choice awards,

06:48.412 --> 06:50.847
Two british comedy awards,
two kids' choice awards,

06:50.915 --> 06:55.318
A prism, a satellite,
and even a golden reel... Ooh...!

06:55.386 --> 06:57.721
It's been called one of the
best tv shows of all time,

06:57.788 --> 07:00.256
And the top show of the past 25 years.

07:00.324 --> 07:03.593
Countless magazines have devoted their
covers to america's favorite family.

07:03.661 --> 07:05.361
But it's not just america.

07:05.429 --> 07:08.164
<i>The simpsons has redefined the term "global
phenomenon,"</i>

07:08.232 --> 07:11.701
Airing in more than 90 countries
and in over 45 different languages.

07:11.769 --> 07:19.075
[marge and homer voices
in different languages]

07:19.143 --> 07:21.177
Spurlock: And it's more than comedy genius.

07:21.245 --> 07:23.480
<i>The simpsons is merchandising gold.</i>

07:23.547 --> 07:25.849
Just about anything under the
sun that can be manufactured

07:25.916 --> 07:28.218
<i>Has been sold with the simpsons logo on
it.</i>

07:28.285 --> 07:29.786
Bed sheets... Bottle openers...

07:29.854 --> 07:32.122
Lunch boxes.... You name it, they had it.

07:32.189 --> 07:34.858
Spurlock: Quite literally,
the simpsons have taken over the world.

07:34.925 --> 07:36.993
They have a star on the
hollywood walk of fame...

07:37.061 --> 07:39.896
A house in vegas...
A ride at universal studios.

07:39.964 --> 07:42.899
They've been in our homes,
on our streets, in our stores.

07:42.967 --> 07:46.803
They've been on stamps, on planes,
and they've taken to the skies as balloons.

07:46.871 --> 07:49.739
Man: In order to ensure that the
pig doesn't cause any trouble,

07:49.807 --> 07:53.243
We do have a marksman on hand who'll
be able to bring the pig down to earth.

07:53.310 --> 07:55.578
Spurlock: Today,
there's no escaping the grasp

07:55.646 --> 07:56.980
Of those stubby little yellow fingers.

07:57.047 --> 07:58.248
<i>We wear simpsons clothing,</i>

07:58.315 --> 07:59.849
<i>We get simpson tattoos,</i>

07:59.917 --> 08:01.417
<i>We take simpson classes...</i>

08:01.485 --> 08:02.919
We even speak simpsonese.

08:02.987 --> 08:04.821
D'oh! D'oh! D'oh!

08:04.889 --> 08:07.690
Spurlock: In 2001,
the word "doh" was officially added

08:07.758 --> 08:09.425
To the oxford english dictionary.

08:09.493 --> 08:11.594
"'doh': Expressing frustration

08:11.662 --> 08:14.731
At the realization that
things have turned out badly."

08:14.799 --> 08:17.500
Spurlock: Quite simply,
it's more than just a show--

08:17.568 --> 08:20.670
It's a multimillion-dollar comedic
freight train and marketing juggernaut

08:20.738 --> 08:22.539
That's gone off the rails
and has completely altered

08:22.606 --> 08:25.642
The cultural landscape as we know it.

08:25.709 --> 08:28.111
<i>This is the simpsons 20th
anniversary special.</i>

08:31.099 --> 08:33.100
A lot of shows give you
a couple of characters--

08:33.167 --> 08:36.903
Maybe two or three guys, a couple of girls,
and if you're lucky, a monkey.

08:36.971 --> 08:40.539
<i>But the simpsons gives you an entire
world.</i>

08:40.607 --> 08:44.344
From an enterprising entrepreneur
to a crack police squad

08:44.412 --> 08:46.280
To a young, idealistic politician,

08:46.347 --> 08:49.616
Springfield is populated by just
about every character known to man.

08:49.684 --> 08:51.385
Dr. Nick... Comic book guy...
Lenny and carl...

08:51.452 --> 08:54.254
Frank grimes... Milhouse...
Barney... Flanders...

08:54.322 --> 08:57.357
Chief wiggum... Sideshow bob...
Hans moleman... The bouvier sisters.

08:57.425 --> 09:00.927
[¶...]

09:00.995 --> 09:04.398
They built this world of
relatable characters, you know,

09:04.465 --> 09:07.334
Like mr. Burns and chief
wiggum and moe the bartender,

09:07.402 --> 09:09.536
And it started to feel like people's towns.

09:09.604 --> 09:12.973
Springfield becomes a great
place to parody and caricature

09:13.041 --> 09:17.477
Any aspect of american town or city life.

09:17.545 --> 09:18.912
[¶...]

09:18.980 --> 09:21.214
Beautiful, huh?

09:21.282 --> 09:23.216
You know, the one thing I was
thinking about springfield

09:23.284 --> 09:25.986
Is that it's all the side characters,
too-- it's not just the family.

09:26.054 --> 09:28.922
Apu, I think, is probably
my favorite character.

09:28.990 --> 09:33.126
¶ homer's a delightful fella,
sorry 'bout the salmonella. ¶

09:33.194 --> 09:36.229
I like apu 'cause he's
always in a great mood

09:36.297 --> 09:38.432
And when you're writing him,
you have to be in a great mood.

09:38.499 --> 09:39.966
You're always kind of smiling.

09:40.034 --> 09:41.868
How much is your penny candy?

09:41.936 --> 09:43.637
Surprisingly expensive.

09:43.705 --> 09:46.106
Unlike every single other
person in springfield,

09:46.174 --> 09:47.874
He works really hard.

09:47.942 --> 09:51.078
I like moe because he reminds
me of a lot of my uncles...

09:51.145 --> 09:52.746
[laughs] growing up.

09:52.814 --> 09:56.049
If I'm not smiling when your check comes,
your meal's on me--

09:56.117 --> 09:57.551
Uncle moe!

09:57.618 --> 10:01.121
I just walked into a room with
matt groening and sam simon

10:01.189 --> 10:03.023
To do moe the bartender,

10:03.091 --> 10:04.591
Who I made sound like pacino, you know...

10:04.659 --> 10:05.992
[imitating]: "I'm dying here!"

10:06.060 --> 10:07.461
So I made this...

10:07.528 --> 10:09.496
[rougher]: Sound gravelly,
and then that was moe.

10:09.564 --> 10:12.299
Here, I, uh... Brung you some posies.

10:12.367 --> 10:16.503
I love moe's sort of
misanthropic nature [laughs].

10:16.571 --> 10:17.571
When I catch you,

10:17.638 --> 10:18.905
I'm gonna pull out your eyes

10:18.973 --> 10:20.340
And shove them down your pants

10:20.408 --> 10:23.243
So you can watch me kick
the crap out of you, okay?!

10:23.311 --> 10:24.711
Having been the mayor of cincinnati,

10:24.779 --> 10:28.315
And then I see mayor quimby,
he's... Very corrupt.

10:28.383 --> 10:30.717
If you speak like a kennedy,
you're halfway home.

10:30.785 --> 10:33.420
Ducking this issue calls
for real leadership.

10:33.488 --> 10:35.756
He truly is the most patronizing politician

10:35.823 --> 10:36.890
I've ever seen in my life.

10:36.958 --> 10:38.792
I'm a bad wittle boy.

10:38.860 --> 10:40.794
[crowd cheering]

10:40.862 --> 10:42.929
Newsom: With the corruption, the graft,

10:42.997 --> 10:46.099
The sexual escapades, the heavy drinking...

10:46.167 --> 10:49.236
Yeah, no, it's just a
typical day at the office.

10:49.303 --> 10:51.605
I think my favorite character
is probably mr. Burns.

10:51.672 --> 10:54.641
Why is the richest and
oldest man in the world

10:54.709 --> 10:56.176
Living in springfield?

10:56.244 --> 11:00.046
Why isn't he in new york
city or buenos aires or rome?

11:00.114 --> 11:01.948
No, he's in springfield.

11:02.016 --> 11:04.384
He's gonna make a tuxedo out of our puppies!

11:04.452 --> 11:06.853
If someone could just put me
out in a pasture somewhere,

11:06.921 --> 11:08.722
In a beautiful part of Spain,

11:08.790 --> 11:11.725
And say, "your job is just...
We'll pay you a dollar a year,

11:11.793 --> 11:13.560
And you can have some cheap red wine,

11:13.628 --> 11:17.164
And just think of weird things for mr.
Burns to say and do..."

11:17.231 --> 11:18.465
[dentures click]

11:18.533 --> 11:20.100
I would take that job.

11:20.168 --> 11:22.469
Smithers is really funny because, you know,

11:22.537 --> 11:24.337
You're really not sure about
his sexual preference.

11:24.405 --> 11:26.807
Glaad counts smithers as a gay character

11:26.874 --> 11:29.209
Because the show has definitely
told us that he's gay.

11:29.277 --> 11:31.111
We would love the character of smithers

11:31.179 --> 11:33.547
To progress by becoming more open

11:33.614 --> 11:36.817
About his sexual orientation
in the community, you know.

11:36.884 --> 11:40.687
Maybe he kind of starts a gay employee
resource group down at the plant.

11:40.755 --> 11:45.192
Kent brockman has, in his own
little world, got it goin' on.

11:45.259 --> 11:49.396
[rock theme music...]

11:49.464 --> 11:53.934
If you can fake the everyman thing,
you've got it made,

11:54.001 --> 11:57.204
And that's clearly what kent
has made his bones doing.

11:57.271 --> 11:58.572
I don't know much, but I do know

11:58.639 --> 12:00.540
A few things about television news,

12:00.608 --> 12:05.946
And to get it bull's-eye, every time,
well, a tip of the stetson to them.

12:06.013 --> 12:10.684
He's got a little bit of that
pomposity going, which we forgive,

12:10.751 --> 12:13.854
Because television anchors
do something special.

12:13.921 --> 12:17.190
We get to tell people what happened.

12:17.258 --> 12:20.026
Spurlock: But as vast as the
world of springfield may seem,

12:20.094 --> 12:25.499
It was all inspired by the gray, cold, wet,
and sleepy hamlet of portland, oregon.

12:25.566 --> 12:28.768
Many of the characters on the show
are named after streets in portland.

12:28.836 --> 12:32.405
I had this idea: The streets in northwest
portland are all in alphabetical order,

12:32.473 --> 12:35.609
And I thought it would be really fun if
people would be driving down 23rd street

12:35.676 --> 12:40.847
And they would see kearney, lovejoy,
quimby, flanders, terwilliger...

12:40.915 --> 12:43.216
The only reason there are not more
characters is 'cause I just couldn't think
of

12:43.284 --> 12:45.285
The names of the streets
off the top of my head.

12:45.353 --> 12:48.522
Spurlock: I'm off to the city of roses
to see some springfieldian sites,

12:48.589 --> 12:52.025
Including the real inspiration
for springfield elementary.

12:52.093 --> 12:54.561
...So you are the principal
here at springfield elementary.

12:54.629 --> 12:56.396
I am, yup.

12:56.464 --> 13:00.433
How does it feel, you know, knowing
that you are kind of the model school?

13:00.501 --> 13:02.035
It's all sinking in right now.

13:02.103 --> 13:03.336
Are you different than principal skinner?

13:03.404 --> 13:04.738
I'm a awful lot different than skinner.

13:04.805 --> 13:06.172
I not having an affair
with any of the teachers.

13:06.240 --> 13:09.509
[all gasp]

13:09.577 --> 13:10.877
Not yet!

13:10.945 --> 13:13.179
Not... Well, yeah-- we won't go there.

13:13.247 --> 13:16.383
<i>Spurlock: Another hometown icon that's
resurfaced in the simpsons is rusty
nails.</i>

13:16.450 --> 13:18.652
Rusty nails was the inspiration--

13:18.719 --> 13:23.123
In a kind of vague, weird, creepy way--

13:23.190 --> 13:25.358
For krusty the clown.

13:25.426 --> 13:26.927
[laughs]

13:26.994 --> 13:29.596
Matt was sitting in the studio audience,

13:29.664 --> 13:31.831
And he was probably around 14 years of age,

13:31.899 --> 13:33.767
And making notes.

13:33.834 --> 13:36.736
I went to him and asked what he was doing

13:36.804 --> 13:39.372
And he said, "well,
I'm gonna have a show of my own."

13:39.440 --> 13:41.007
And I said, "great, go for it."

13:41.075 --> 13:44.044
The difference is krusty is
jewish and totally corrupt.

13:44.111 --> 13:46.513
Krusty, I... Shut your hole!

13:46.581 --> 13:50.050
Groening: And rusty nails is a very,
very religious, christian clown.

13:50.117 --> 13:52.185
He's really sweet and nice.

13:52.253 --> 13:53.687
Hi, girls and boys!

13:53.754 --> 13:56.289
Post the other clowns getting
involved in fast food,

13:56.357 --> 13:59.526
Nobody came to you and said, "we'd love to
have you be the face of our food chain"?

13:59.594 --> 14:04.764
And krustyburger is the official mea
t-flavored sandwich of the 1984 olympics!

14:04.832 --> 14:06.299
No. No?

14:06.367 --> 14:09.869
This is my apology to rusty nails,
if there's any inference

14:09.937 --> 14:12.639
That the character of krusty
is anything like rusty.

I've always liked milhouse,
and growing up, like,

15:04.218 --> 15:07.587
As a jewish nerd with glasses,
with divorced parents,

15:07.655 --> 15:09.756
It's hard to have any representation on tv.

15:22.970 --> 15:25.339
How can someone with glasses
that thick be so stupid?

15:25.406 --> 15:29.609
You've gotta be a committed fan
to tattoo milhouse on your arm.

15:29.677 --> 15:32.012

That is, until I realized that this
was just the tip of the iceberg.

19:24.946 --> 19:37.090
["also sprach zarathustra" playing...]

19:37.158 --> 19:39.426
...No way. [laughs]

19:47.134 --> 19:48.435
...This is the treehouse.

19:48.502 --> 19:51.371
The treehouse of horror.

19:51.439 --> 19:54.741
Glynn sacrificed christmas
presents and birthday presents,

19:54.809 --> 19:57.944
<i>So people in the family and friends
have bought him simpsons stuff.</i>

19:58.012 --> 20:00.113
It's an investment-- see that?

20:00.181 --> 20:03.350
It's the grandchildren's
inheritance. [all laugh]

20:03.417 --> 20:05.552
So does he have a list of things?

20:05.620 --> 20:07.253
He's like, "if you're gonna
buy me something, buy me this,

20:07.321 --> 20:08.688
And by the way, here's the link on ebay"?

20:08.756 --> 20:09.856
[laughs] yes! You do that?! Yes.

20:09.924 --> 20:13.059
This is mainly glassware and china.

20:13.127 --> 20:16.529
This is kind of school stuff-- pencils,
pencil cases, desk tidies...

20:16.597 --> 20:18.665
Car care kits, valet kits.

20:18.733 --> 20:21.768
There is not a product that they
won't put their name on. No.

20:21.836 --> 20:24.404
...I thought glynn was the
only crazy one in the house,

20:24.472 --> 20:27.907
Until I was led into his wife's secret room.

20:27.975 --> 20:30.910
Turns out, collecting runs in the family.

20:30.978 --> 20:33.146
...You're not allowed to say anything.

20:33.214 --> 20:35.148
No, no, I'm just as sad as him, I'm afraid.

20:35.216 --> 20:36.983
Everybody says that.

20:37.051 --> 20:40.220
...Sad or not, if it weren't
for people like glynn,

20:40.287 --> 20:42.956
We probably would have lost homer years ago.

20:43.024 --> 20:46.926
So cheers, glynn, and thanks.

20:46.994 --> 20:50.597

20:50.665 --> 20:52.899
Moby, I'd love for you to tell me why

20:52.967 --> 20:54.467
<i>You are such a fan of the simpsons.</i>

20:54.535 --> 20:57.070
It's funny, and it's smart,
and it's social satire.

20:57.138 --> 21:00.740
My personal favorite song is "the mr.
Plow theme song."

21:00.808 --> 21:01.741
¶ call mr. Plow ¶

21:01.809 --> 21:02.742

21:02.810 --> 21:05.445

21:05.513 --> 21:08.014
You can imagine, you know, a zen monk

21:08.082 --> 21:10.517
Sitting on the top of a
mountain for 15 years

21:10.584 --> 21:12.052
Just thinking about that.

21:12.119 --> 21:15.188
Like, "what is identity made
manifest through this mr. Plow?"

21:15.256 --> 21:20.060
I've done seven interpretations of "
the mr. Plow theme song."

21:20.127 --> 21:23.163
The blues version... The psychedelic
version... The punk rock version.

21:23.230 --> 21:27.634
This is a really embarrassing,
old school hip-hop version of "mr. Plow."

21:27.702 --> 21:29.035
[alarm rings]

21:29.103 --> 21:33.106
[hip-hop version playing...]

22:08.909 --> 22:10.577
Promise you'll never do that again.

22:10.644 --> 22:11.811
All right.

22:15.031 --> 22:17.032
<i>If the simpsons were a live-action tv
show,</i>

22:17.099 --> 22:20.268
They probably would have been yanked off
by minute three of their first episode,

22:20.336 --> 22:23.605
But as an animated tv show,
they can get away with murder.

22:23.673 --> 22:25.440
[¶...]

22:25.508 --> 22:26.942
And a whole lot more.

22:27.009 --> 22:30.445
This is for the United States of america!

22:30.513 --> 22:32.981
Oh, no! Chinese fire drill!

22:33.049 --> 22:34.215
Serious this time!

22:34.283 --> 22:36.918
Shut up-pa your mouth!

22:36.986 --> 22:39.454
So here's a show that comes on at a time

22:39.522 --> 22:43.391
When most shows that breach
this kind of subject matter

22:43.459 --> 22:44.592
Would have to be on later...

22:44.660 --> 22:45.927
And it gets away with it.

22:45.995 --> 22:48.830
You could make all kinds
of inappropriate jokes

22:48.898 --> 22:50.799
And get away with it

22:50.866 --> 22:53.802
Because they're big,
yellow people with googly eyes.

22:53.869 --> 22:55.737
But being animated hasn't stopped them

22:55.805 --> 22:57.973
From courting real-life controversy.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.375
Remember george bush the
first was all upset about it?

23:00.443 --> 23:03.478
Make american families a
lot more like the waltons

23:03.546 --> 23:05.714
And a lot less like the simpsons.

23:05.781 --> 23:07.148
Remember him?

23:07.216 --> 23:08.550
<i>You thought he was bad at the time.</i>

23:08.617 --> 23:11.586
Barbara bush, the first lady of america,

23:11.654 --> 23:14.656
She called it the stupidest
thing she'd ever seen.

23:14.724 --> 23:17.192
I think now, "hey,
look at your kid," you know?

23:17.259 --> 23:20.528
Nowadays we get, you know,
you know, we get [beep]

23:20.596 --> 23:25.000
For making fun of jesus and
for sodomy jokes and whatnot,

23:25.067 --> 23:29.371
But back then it was, "this kid
is talking back to his parents!"

23:29.438 --> 23:32.407
You don't think much of me,
do you, boy? No, sir!

23:32.475 --> 23:36.144
I think the best comedy is
always offending somebody.

23:36.212 --> 23:40.015
I think it takes kind
of a healthy disrespect

23:40.082 --> 23:42.083
For everything americans hold dear.

23:42.151 --> 23:46.087
And a lot of times we've been lucky
in offending exactly the right people.

23:46.155 --> 23:49.057
We'd say, "well, this will certainly
offend these people who we don't like,"

23:49.125 --> 23:50.825
And it does, and we're
quite thrilled with that.

Spurlock: And bill donohue

23:56.332 --> 23:59.901
Has made an entire career
out of being offended.

23:59.969 --> 24:03.405
Donohue: The catholic league was
founded in 1973 by father virgil blum.

24:03.472 --> 24:05.874
We're basically here just
to hold up a stop sign

24:05.941 --> 24:07.609
When people may cross the line

24:07.676 --> 24:10.512
Into disdain, disparagement, insult.

24:10.579 --> 24:13.381
November of '98 in particular
was one of the first times

24:13.449 --> 24:15.350
<i>That the phones were ringing off
the hook about the simpsons.</i>

24:15.418 --> 24:18.686
Mom, can we go catholic so we can
get communion wafers and booze?

24:18.754 --> 24:21.289
What are catholics supposed to be, a piñata?

24:21.357 --> 24:25.326
Are we supposed to be like, like, the,
the guy that you can just beat up on?

24:25.394 --> 24:27.662
One of my favorite offensive moments was one

24:27.730 --> 24:30.999
When we were trying not to be offensive,
but were accused of it.

24:31.067 --> 24:32.500
It was a super bowl episode. [horn honks]

24:32.568 --> 24:36.738
Donohue: You got this gal, you know,
skimpily-- a buxom girl--

24:36.806 --> 24:39.808
And she's running around
with the big cross, saying,

24:39.875 --> 24:44.479
"hey, it's a great thing to be catholic--
look, everything is changing in our
society."

24:44.547 --> 24:47.782
It leaves an impression
in the mind of the viewer

24:47.850 --> 24:51.052
That the catholic church really is something

24:51.120 --> 24:55.056
That's fair game to be ridiculed
and mocked in some form or another.

24:55.124 --> 24:59.060
The network calls and says,
"you can't say 'the catholic church'."

24:59.128 --> 25:00.962
What it does is I think it eats away

25:01.030 --> 25:02.730
At the moral prestige
of the catholic church.

25:02.798 --> 25:04.365
And I tried to explain,
"that isn't the joke.

25:04.433 --> 25:05.767
"we're not attacking their religion.

25:05.835 --> 25:08.336
"it's just a crazy association
with this commercial--

25:08.404 --> 25:10.205
It's about super bowl commercials,"

25:10.272 --> 25:13.007
And they kept arguing the point, "no,
it's offensive, it's offensive,"

25:13.075 --> 25:16.945
And finally, you know, he said, "all right,
I'll tell you, we can compromise.

25:17.012 --> 25:19.047
Could you change it to methodist?"

25:19.115 --> 25:21.049
How about methodist? No!

25:21.117 --> 25:24.586
To all you catholics out there,
we meant nothing by it.

25:24.653 --> 25:27.021
Bill donohue may be overly
concerned with the lasting effects

25:27.089 --> 25:29.324
<i>The simpsons has had on the catholic
church,</i>

25:29.391 --> 25:33.561

simpsons have done to nuclear power.

to say that most americans

from the simpsons.</i>

Why the simpsons are loved by
so many different people...

But there's one reason in particular
that folks keep coming back to.

What do you love about the show? Homer.

Why do you like homer?

'cause he's such an idiot.

28:06.779 --> 28:08.947
Shut up, brain,
or I'll stab you with a q-tip.

28:09.015 --> 28:11.717
A guy like homer seems a lot of fun,
but really from a distance.

28:11.784 --> 28:13.352
Mirkin: He just lives so in the moment.

28:13.419 --> 28:14.753
He's so all-id.

He is as happy as anybody can be.

He is as angry as anybody can be.

28:19.425 --> 28:20.893
He is as loving as anybody can be.

And secondly I heard what you said.

28:27.233 --> 28:30.068
I think it was john swartzwelder
who said that writing homer,

28:30.136 --> 28:31.370
You have to approach it

28:31.437 --> 28:32.971
As if you were writing a dog who can talk.

we americans love homer,

that love is universal.

28:41.781 --> 28:43.215
Homer: Aw...

28:43.283 --> 28:45.217
It's possible that they
look at homer and they go,

28:45.285 --> 28:46.718
"that's what americans are like,"

28:46.786 --> 28:50.155
So there's a little bit of
laughing at us and not with us.

28:50.223 --> 28:53.191
Mmm... Fattening.

28:53.259 --> 28:56.395
He's fat, he's lazy,
he's obnoxious, he's crazy.

28:56.462 --> 28:58.497
Americans, they like the
finer things in life,

28:58.565 --> 29:02.501
Like donuts and beer and
hot dogs and pretzels.

29:02.569 --> 29:04.570
But you love him, yeah?

29:04.637 --> 29:06.238
Everyone loves homer simpson.

29:06.306 --> 29:09.708
I think everyone can see a
bit of themselves in homer

29:09.776 --> 29:11.443
Or at least one of the other characters.

29:11.511 --> 29:14.413
Stupid tv... Be more funny!

29:14.480 --> 29:18.650
It's one of the shows that puts down
america, that makes fun of america,

29:18.718 --> 29:20.485
That doesn't have to have the attitude,

29:20.553 --> 29:23.188
"america's number one and
there's nothing wrong with us."

29:23.256 --> 29:26.925
[honking horn]: U-s-a! U-s-a! U-s-a!

29:26.993 --> 29:30.262
What does the show teach you about america?

29:32.098 --> 29:33.065
[romantic music...]

29:33.132 --> 29:35.634
Man: ¶ señor plow... ¶

29:35.702 --> 29:40.272
<i>Spurlock: No country has been more
outspoken in their love for the simpsons
than argentina.</i>

29:40.340 --> 29:43.075
<i>Here in the land of tango, mate,
and copyright infringement,</i>

29:43.142 --> 29:46.912
<i>The simpsons movie was the highes
t-grossing film of 2007,</i>

29:46.980 --> 29:49.781
And homer is everywhere on
the streets of buenos aires.

29:49.849 --> 29:56.655
<i>Argentines love the simpsons so much that
they actually have a duff brewery.</i>

29:56.723 --> 29:59.558
Lucas pouyau started it back in 2007.

29:59.626 --> 30:02.494
How did you start bottling duff beer?

30:02.562 --> 30:05.430
<i>Uh... We was watching the simpsons.</i>

30:05.498 --> 30:07.899
Who wants to party?!

30:07.967 --> 30:11.803
I went to the kitchen, I opened the fridge,

30:11.871 --> 30:15.107
And I think, "why you no have a duff here?"

30:15.174 --> 30:16.108
Yeah... I want a duff!

30:16.175 --> 30:17.342
Yeah. Yeah.

30:17.410 --> 30:18.877
What's been the response from america?

30:18.945 --> 30:20.912
Are they happy that you're making duff beer?

30:20.980 --> 30:22.748
Uh... I don't know.

30:22.815 --> 30:24.616
Spurlock: Americans love
it so much, in fact,

30:24.684 --> 30:27.719
That fox has a pending lawsuit
against the duff brewery.

30:27.787 --> 30:28.920
Oh, yeah...

30:28.988 --> 30:29.888
[both laugh]

30:29.956 --> 30:36.461
[tango playing...]

30:36.529 --> 30:37.829
Are they like your family?

30:37.897 --> 30:39.431
Yes. Yeah?

30:39.499 --> 30:44.403
We have, uh, people like moe,
people like seymour skinner,

30:44.470 --> 30:47.706
Teachers like krabappel who are single
and desperately looking for a man.

30:47.774 --> 30:49.675
[both laugh]

30:49.742 --> 30:51.943
I have a... A tattoo.

30:52.011 --> 30:53.445
You have a tattoo.

30:53.513 --> 30:55.981
Yes, it's of the stonecu... Cutters.

30:56.049 --> 30:57.115
Oh, the stonecutters.

30:57.183 --> 30:58.817
Yes, it's on my back.

30:58.885 --> 31:00.952
Oh, that.

31:01.020 --> 31:01.853
It's just a birthmark...

31:01.921 --> 31:03.588
And I'll thank you not to stare!

31:03.656 --> 31:04.790
<i>To the simpsons!</i>

31:04.857 --> 31:07.826
<i>All: To the simpsons!</i>

31:07.894 --> 31:09.861
<i>Why is the simpsons so successful?</i>

31:09.929 --> 31:12.964
People have a lot of theories,
as to why that's the case.

31:13.032 --> 31:15.033
Here's the one thing no one talks about:

31:15.101 --> 31:18.203
Their eyes look like boobs.

31:18.271 --> 31:19.971
[pacifier pops]

31:20.039 --> 31:21.707
I feel like I could go
anywhere in the world,

31:21.774 --> 31:23.942
And if they were about to put a knife in me,

31:24.010 --> 31:27.546
I could quickly draw, you know,
a bart and hold it up and go...

31:27.613 --> 31:29.981
"uh... Uh uh... Write."

31:30.049 --> 31:31.983
[indistinct accent]: And they'd be like,
"ah... Let him go.

31:32.051 --> 31:34.319
Let this one go."

31:34.387 --> 31:37.556
I'm not sure what country I'm
in when I do that, but...

31:37.623 --> 31:39.658
This is the greatest thrill
of my life! Whoo-hoo!

31:39.726 --> 31:41.460
Spurlock: But as much as
the world loves homer,

31:41.527 --> 31:43.695
There's no question that
he's caused his family

31:43.763 --> 31:46.598
A share of rocky moments over the years.

31:46.666 --> 31:48.800
As a parent, what does the
show teach you about parenting?

31:48.868 --> 31:50.802
What not to do. Yeah.

31:50.870 --> 31:53.638
Homer's not a perfect dad,
bart's obviously not a perfect son,

31:53.706 --> 31:55.607
Marge is just trying to
hold it all together...

31:55.675 --> 31:57.709
It is so dysfunctional of a family!

31:57.777 --> 32:00.412
[rip, crash]

32:00.480 --> 32:02.047
What was that? Ah, who cares?

32:02.115 --> 32:04.816
By having a nuclear family
and having them dysfunctional

32:04.884 --> 32:07.452
Tapped into everyone feeling kind of like

32:07.520 --> 32:08.820
Their own family is dysfunctional.

32:08.888 --> 32:10.989
It's just hard not to listen to tv.

32:11.057 --> 32:13.258
It's spent so much more time
raising us than you have.

32:13.326 --> 32:15.827
I think the simpsons could
very well be on our show.

32:15.895 --> 32:19.631
It'd be such a poster for dysfunction

32:19.699 --> 32:22.067
That, frankly, I would
well up just watching them.

32:22.135 --> 32:23.502
I need a hug.

32:23.569 --> 32:25.337
All: Uh...

32:25.404 --> 32:28.673
I don't want you even to
talk about dysfunction.

32:28.741 --> 32:30.275
This is a perfect couple!

32:30.343 --> 32:31.610
<i>Cara mia...</i>

32:31.677 --> 32:33.578
Dr. Ruth: They love each other.

32:33.646 --> 32:35.514
Jim brooks always said that
the reason we love homer

32:35.581 --> 32:37.082
Is 'cause marge loves homer,

32:37.150 --> 32:40.252
But I also think that we love
homer because homer loves marge.

32:40.319 --> 32:42.187
No matter what else,

32:42.255 --> 32:44.790
When it comes down to it,
the family sticks together.

32:44.857 --> 32:46.725
<i>I don't think the simpsons would work</i>

32:46.793 --> 32:49.628
If you didn't believe that marge and
homer loved each other, and you do.

32:49.695 --> 32:55.113
The secret is that they talk to each other,
that they have a relationship.

32:55.164 --> 32:56.998
i'm a lucky woman.

32:56.998 --> 32:59.398
and i'm a wonderful man.

32:59.398 --> 33:01.298
that they don't just have sex.

33:01.298 --> 33:02.431
[sighing...]

33:02.431 --> 33:06.031
actually, the sex is really good... yeah.

33:06.031 --> 33:08.464
[homer growls, marge laughs]

33:08.464 --> 33:10.598
heh-heh. ooh...

33:10.598 --> 33:14.031
one of the things i love
about current fandom

33:14.031 --> 33:17.131
is that people are so invested in the show

33:17.131 --> 33:21.164
that they are willing to
criticize the show to our faces!

33:21.164 --> 33:24.231
the people who say,
as it was five years ago!"

33:24.231 --> 33:26.298
it's like, "well, neither are you,
if that's the problem."

33:26.298 --> 33:28.064
there's nobody who ever went online

33:28.064 --> 33:30.231
to read comments about anything they've done

33:30.231 --> 33:32.398
that doesn't come away with one...

33:32.398 --> 33:35.764
one sullen [bleep] someplace... [laughs]

33:35.764 --> 33:37.264
who says the thing that will...

33:37.264 --> 33:39.398
that you have to have surgically
removed from your brain.

33:39.398 --> 33:40.998
i think the internet message boards

33:40.998 --> 33:43.131
used to be a lot funnier 10 years ago...

33:43.131 --> 33:46.331
and i've sort of stopped, uh,
stopped reading their new posts.

33:52.198 --> 33:53.498
spurlock: over the past 20 years,

33:53.498 --> 33:56.031
the simpsons family has literally
traveled around the world.

33:56.031 --> 33:58.231
10,000 yen for coleslaw?

33:58.231 --> 34:00.631
[plays didgeridoo]

34:00.631 --> 34:03.131
i'll endanger you!

34:03.131 --> 34:06.131
and while most countries are
grateful to be featured on the show,

34:06.131 --> 34:10.531
not every nation is in love with
america's first family of television.

34:10.531 --> 34:13.464
the simpsons are going to antarctica!

34:13.464 --> 34:14.664
next year.

34:14.664 --> 34:16.231
this year, brazil.

34:16.231 --> 34:19.063
spurlock: in 2002,  caused quite a stir

34:19.063 --> 34:21.098
when the family visited rio de janeiro.

34:21.098 --> 34:25.731
portrayals of teleboobies, kidnapping
and colored rats were not taken lightly.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.264
ooh, they look like skittles!

34:28.264 --> 34:34.231
[whistle blows, brazilian music plays...]

34:34.231 --> 34:38.231
spurlock: i met with paula gobe,
former head of the foreign press in brazil,

34:38.231 --> 34:40.164
to find out why the country of sex and samba

34:40.164 --> 34:43.531
was so offended by the casual
observations of the simpsons.

34:43.531 --> 34:45.364
...did the people of brazil understand

34:45.364 --> 34:47.098
that  offends everybody?

34:47.098 --> 34:49.031
no, they didn't understand it.

34:49.031 --> 34:53.531
you know, like an adolescent,
they are still very sensitive to criticism.

34:53.531 --> 34:59.764
the sore that it raised is still there
in rio de janeiro... seven years later.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.198
spurlock: with limited time in rio,

35:02.198 --> 35:05.764
i had to check out what the city is
most famous for: parties and beaches.

35:05.764 --> 35:09.631
and if i learned everything from
this episode of  it's what to wear.

35:09.631 --> 35:11.264
lifeguard: [blows whistle]

35:11.264 --> 35:14.398
excuse me, americans,
there is a dress code on this beach.

Advertise your product or brand here

35:24.764 --> 35:28.731
when you're in brazil, we have a
thing that we call the brazilian way.

35:28.731 --> 35:32.098
the drunkenness, the ambiguous sexuality.

35:32.098 --> 35:33.698
we were born like this!

35:33.698 --> 35:35.564
we're not, like, bad people.

35:40.498 --> 35:43.731
well, i thought the people were
most offended by the monkeys.

35:43.731 --> 35:46.664
[monkeys screeching...]

35:46.664 --> 35:50.164
the fact of these monkeys running
after them in the shantytown.

35:50.164 --> 35:52.398
child: i am like sugar to them!

35:52.398 --> 35:55.564
it made rio look like a very backwards city.

35:58.631 --> 36:01.164
do you feel like that episode hurt brazil?

36:01.164 --> 36:02.464
very much, very much.

36:07.431 --> 36:10.998
brazil has lots of structural problems.

36:10.998 --> 36:14.998
so, like, problems with the security,
problems with the health system.

36:14.998 --> 36:16.198
no monkey gangs?

36:16.198 --> 36:18.231
[laughs] no monkey gangs.

36:18.231 --> 36:19.298
no? o.k.

36:19.298 --> 36:21.131
there's monkeys in rio de janeiro,

36:21.131 --> 36:23.731
and actually i think that's
something that's really beautiful.

36:23.731 --> 36:30.031
the beauty, the sun, the people,
the music, the rhythm, the vibration.

36:30.031 --> 36:32.131
the rats painted like skittles.

36:32.131 --> 36:33.131
right. [laughs]

36:38.064 --> 36:41.598
for stirring up controversy has
always been a badge of honor.

36:41.598 --> 36:46.498
but it turns out brazil isn't the only
place where the show has sown the seeds of
unrest.

36:46.498 --> 36:48.398
[bagpipes and rock music playing...]

36:48.398 --> 36:52.198
scotland's a far cry from the
tranquil streets of springfield,

36:52.198 --> 36:55.398
but the country of haggis
and braveheart is home

36:55.398 --> 36:57.564
to one famous springfieldian. willie?!

36:57.564 --> 36:59.198
spurlock: while there's no question

36:59.198 --> 37:00.998
scotland is willie's homeland,

37:00.998 --> 37:03.731
his actual hometown is
still a matter of debate.

37:03.731 --> 37:08.231
on opposing sides of the divide:
former glasgow provost liz cameron

37:08.231 --> 37:11.498
and aberdeen football coach mark mcghee.

37:11.498 --> 37:13.364
each of them is leading
their respective city

37:13.364 --> 37:16.264
in a fierce battle to
claim willie as their own.

37:16.264 --> 37:18.764
...how do you know that groundskeeper
willie is a glaswegian?

37:18.764 --> 37:24.031
some years ago, he fell in
love with an english nanny.

37:24.031 --> 37:27.198
willie: shary bobbins and i were engaged
to be wed back in the old country.

37:27.198 --> 37:28.698
she spurned him!

37:28.698 --> 37:31.464
he was completely and utterly bereft.

37:31.464 --> 37:35.631
suddenly, the ugliest man in
glasgow wasn't good enough for her!

37:35.631 --> 37:38.264
spurlock: for glasgow,
that's all the evidence they need.

37:38.264 --> 37:42.631
but 145 miles to the north,
in the highland town of aberdeen,

37:42.631 --> 37:44.698
a very different story is being told.

37:44.698 --> 37:49.264
the town and its very popular football team
know for sure that willie is one of them.

37:49.264 --> 37:50.998
[sleepily]: muh? huh? what?

37:50.998 --> 37:53.364
go, aberdeen! [snores]

37:53.364 --> 37:55.098
all: go, aberdeen!

37:55.098 --> 37:57.631
spurlock: i met with coach mark
mcghee to get the full story.

37:57.631 --> 37:59.431
...apparently they say he's glaswegian.

37:59.431 --> 38:01.231
i think all the evidence for me

38:01.231 --> 38:03.331
points to him being an aberdonian.

38:03.331 --> 38:06.331
he doesn't speak with a glaswegian accent,

38:06.331 --> 38:09.431
he doesn't dress in any
sort of glaswegian way.

38:09.431 --> 38:12.398
spurlock: and aberdeen football club
has more than just willie's word

38:12.398 --> 38:14.131
as proof of where his allegiance lies.

38:14.131 --> 38:18.431
we do of course have the
photographs that we've unearthed.

38:18.431 --> 38:23.464
you can see clearly willie,
here celebrating a goal.

38:23.464 --> 38:28.131
spurlock: even with mark mcghee's
photographic evidence, the feud shows no
sign of dying.

38:28.131 --> 38:31.664
so the world may never know from
where willie actually hails,

38:31.664 --> 38:35.364
but one thing is certain:
he definitely left his ginger-haired mark

38:35.364 --> 38:37.764
in the hearts and minds of
those who know him stateside.

38:37.764 --> 38:42.264
north americans were asked
what reminds them of scotland,

38:42.264 --> 38:44.331
what do they associate when they
think of scotland and the scots.

38:44.331 --> 38:47.498
over the years, scotland's given
a number of gifts to the world.

38:47.498 --> 38:50.564
there's the tv, the telephone,
there's penicillin,

38:50.564 --> 38:54.531
deep-fried mars bars, loch ness monster,
dolly the cloned sheep,

38:54.531 --> 38:57.131
sean connery and even susan boyle.

38:57.131 --> 38:59.331
and eventually when it came back,
there was only one winner,

38:59.331 --> 39:01.764
and it was groundskeeper willie.

39:01.764 --> 39:03.431
[crowd gasps in dismay]

39:03.431 --> 39:09.031
ah, 'tis no more that what god gave me,
you puritan pukes!

39:12.431 --> 39:13.164
spurlock: The Simpsons has been

39:13.164 --> 39:14.731
on the air for such a long time

39:14.731 --> 39:17.131
that even die-hard fans
probably take it for granted.

39:17.131 --> 39:19.831
at this point, the show's like
running water or electricity

39:19.831 --> 39:21.864
or the absence of the berlin wall,

39:21.864 --> 39:24.598
but to truly appreciate the
impact the show has had,

39:24.598 --> 39:26.331
we have to do the unthinkable

39:26.331 --> 39:31.431
and imagine what it would be like
if The Simpsons never existed.

39:31.431 --> 39:32.331
if The Simpsons never existed,

39:32.331 --> 39:36.164
the world would have been destroyed in
a nuclear holocaust a long time ago.

39:36.164 --> 39:41.831
this is the show that has kept the world
alive and the world laughing instead of
killing.

39:41.831 --> 39:43.264
desolation!

39:43.264 --> 39:46.631
i mean, cultural desolation...
without The Simpsons...

39:46.631 --> 39:48.698
it'd be like, you know,
a cormac mccarthy novel--

39:48.698 --> 39:50.698
just scorched earth, nothing.

39:50.698 --> 39:53.198
i think i would be loading
tires in a warehouse

39:53.198 --> 39:57.331
and i'd be drawing pictures of the
foreman on the walls during my breaks.

39:57.331 --> 39:59.264
i would be a professional ballroom dancer.

39:59.264 --> 40:01.664
i'd probably be looking for acting jobs.

40:01.664 --> 40:04.598
my world would be a lot worse...
[laughs]...i would have to say.

40:04.598 --> 40:06.298
i'd be a lot poorer.

40:06.298 --> 40:07.798
i wouldn't be living in malibu.

40:07.798 --> 40:10.698
i would have a much uglier wife, i think.

40:10.698 --> 40:13.331
i don't know what the world would be
like without beethoven's fifth, you know?

40:13.331 --> 40:17.731
if had never existed, i think i
would probably be a math teacher.

40:17.731 --> 40:18.964
probably be still back in colorado.

40:19.464 --> 40:21.631
yeah, i don't think i'd be
doing a whole lot with my life.

40:21.631 --> 40:23.831
yeah, i don't think so.
i don't know what we would have done.

40:23.831 --> 40:28.298
we'd still have, uh,
So you think you can dance...

40:28.298 --> 40:30.498
and America's next dance...

40:30.498 --> 40:33.098
and, uh,  Now that's what I call dancing...

40:33.098 --> 40:35.264
i don't want to imagine that-
it's a horrible thought.

40:35.264 --> 40:38.264
a world without The Simpsons.
how ridiculous.

40:38.264 --> 40:39.598
[explosion]

40:39.598 --> 40:42.231
so my goal from the very beginning
was to invade pop culture.

40:42.231 --> 40:46.298
that was my goal as an underground
cartoonist: see how far i could carry this.

40:46.298 --> 40:50.464
and i consider every aspect of
The Simpsons beyond the show

40:50.464 --> 40:53.131
as part of that whole strategy.

40:53.131 --> 40:57.231
my advice to any cartoonist out there
is to try to make yourself laugh.

40:57.231 --> 40:59.531
don't worry about what other people think
is funny; do what you think is funny.

40:59.531 --> 41:03.231
that's where the best stuff comes from.

41:03.231 --> 41:05.398
that wasn't even in 3-d!

41:05.398 --> 41:07.164
and where were the ice skaters?

41:07.164 --> 41:09.464
again, tv, you have misled us.

41:09.464 --> 41:11.164
stupid, lying fox!

41:11.164 --> 41:13.231
oh, wait! here comes something!

41:13.231 --> 41:16.531
announcer: o.k., kids,
here it comes! put on your 3-d glasses!

41:16.531 --> 41:18.298
3... 2... 1!

41:18.298 --> 41:23.131
[dramatic music...]

41:32.131 --> 41:33.464
[music ends]

41:33.464 --> 41:35.198
i liked it!

41:35.198 --> 41:37.198
[theme playing...]

41:37.198 --> 41:40.031
spurlock: if you had to write the
ending of the Simpsons how would it end?

41:40.031 --> 41:42.998
o'brien: marge is gonna take a good,
hard look at homer

41:42.998 --> 41:47.498
and say, "he's so stupid.
and he'd screwed us over so many times."

41:47.498 --> 41:49.698
it'd be humorless, it won't be funny...

41:49.698 --> 41:52.231
it'll just be her looking
at homer and saying,

41:52.231 --> 41:55.064
"you are such a stupid son of a bitch.

41:55.064 --> 41:57.264
"i... you're endangering my children,

41:57.264 --> 42:00.364
"you've destroyed the town 600,000 times,

42:00.364 --> 42:03.531
"you... you're a threat to mankind.

42:03.531 --> 42:06.764
i'm leaving you, i'm leaving you forever."

42:06.764 --> 42:08.264
[door slams]

42:08.264 --> 42:11.498
honey... the door blew shut...

42:11.498 --> 42:13.064
oh, fine.

42:13.064 --> 42:16.098
