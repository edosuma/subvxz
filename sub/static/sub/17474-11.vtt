00:08.649 --> 00:09.849
I'm trying to think like Marilyn,

00:09.867 --> 00:10.951
and you're not exactly helping.

00:10.985 --> 00:12.243
I'm her boyfriend.

00:12.243 --> 00:14.344
Yeah, well I'm her director
so keep your hands to yourself.

00:14.344 --> 00:16.356
Unh!

00:16.908 --> 00:19.294
♪ Tomatoes like her,
well, they're easy to find ♪

00:20.679 --> 00:22.397
You're crazy about that dancer.

00:22.431 --> 00:24.415
I heard there's a press
opening at the white house.

00:24.433 --> 00:25.750
I can get you an interview.

00:25.768 --> 00:26.918
I think you'll want to hear this.

00:26.952 --> 00:28.219
How dare you go delving into

00:28.253 --> 00:30.104
the personal lives of my friends.

Oh.

00:43.986 --> 00:46.037
You really bumped it up a notch,
didn't you?

00:46.071 --> 00:47.438
What are you talking about?

00:47.456 --> 00:49.407
Aw, she dressed up for the movie star.

00:49.441 --> 00:51.075
No, I didn't.

00:51.109 --> 00:52.210
Oh, my God,
you're wearing lipstick and everything.

00:52.244 --> 00:54.045
It's lip gloss, whatever.

00:54.079 --> 00:56.447
Fine, I'm excited.
I'm Rebecca Duvall's understudy.

00:56.465 --> 00:58.049
- Yes.
- Yeah, you are.

00:58.083 --> 01:00.084
Oh, the first time I saw
a Rebecca Duvall movie

01:00.118 --> 01:02.620
was when my babysitter
took me out of soccer

01:02.638 --> 01:04.305
<i>to go see the disembodied.</i>

01:04.340 --> 01:07.392
She was amazing--
I was scarred for life.

01:07.426 --> 01:09.410
- What were you, like, 13?
- Try ten.

01:09.445 --> 01:13.264
Yeah, um, isn't she a little old
to be playing Marilyn?

01:13.298 --> 01:15.400
No, she's perfect.

01:15.434 --> 01:18.102
Yeah but wasn't Marilyn,
like, 36 when she died?

01:18.136 --> 01:21.739
Yes, and Rebecca is 36...ish.

01:21.774 --> 01:24.108
"Ish" being the operative word.

01:24.142 --> 01:26.244
Ooh, girl,
oh, no she didn't.

01:26.278 --> 01:29.313
Oh, prrt!

01:29.331 --> 01:31.315
Please don't ever do that again.

01:31.333 --> 01:32.617
Seriously.

01:32.651 --> 01:34.118
- You're right.
- Okay, ha-ha-ha!

01:34.152 --> 01:36.004
You guys have been
flirting your asses off

01:36.038 --> 01:38.339
for the last week--
so would you mind, please,

01:38.374 --> 01:40.658
just to go out on a real date.

01:40.676 --> 01:42.760
Preferably one where I'm not there.

01:42.795 --> 01:44.479
We're just talking.

01:44.513 --> 01:47.682
Hi, yes, I'd like
to make a reservation for two.

01:47.716 --> 01:50.501
Tomorrow night at 7:00.

01:50.519 --> 01:52.937
Yes, under Tom Levitt.

01:52.971 --> 01:55.306
"L" as in lovebirds.

01:55.340 --> 02:00.194
E-V-I-T-T.
Thank you.

02:00.229 --> 02:02.947
Do it.

02:02.981 --> 02:04.782
Well, you should try

02:04.817 --> 02:07.017
the original one in Cobble Hill,
it's not as scene-y.

02:07.036 --> 02:09.120
Well if you're there, darling,
I'm guessing there's a scene.

02:09.154 --> 02:10.988
No, no, last time I went
they made me wait

02:11.021 --> 02:12.540
a half an hour for a table.

02:12.574 --> 02:17.462
Well, I admire your patience.
I never wait for tables.

02:17.496 --> 02:19.547
All right, everyone!

02:19.581 --> 02:21.049
The other day you had a chance to meet

02:21.083 --> 02:23.301
the incomparable Rebecca Duvall.

02:23.335 --> 02:25.553
Give her a proper "Marilyn" welcome.

02:25.587 --> 02:27.889
Today we all dive into the work.

02:27.923 --> 02:29.390
Now Rebecca's gonna
jump in with a bit of

02:29.425 --> 02:31.142
<i>Let me be your star,</i>

02:31.176 --> 02:33.344
and we'll take her through
the choreography, okay?

02:33.378 --> 02:35.646
Rebecca, would you like
to warm up with Larry

02:35.681 --> 02:37.047
before we start?

02:37.066 --> 02:39.400
Nope, I'm good.

Josh, you want to set that up?

03:40.779 --> 03:43.397
- Right, thanks, Rebecca.
- Oh, thanks.

03:49.471 --> 03:50.955

- Yup.

03:50.973 --> 03:52.423

- Great.

03:52.457 --> 03:53.624
- Yup.

03:53.642 --> 03:55.593
- Great.
- Yup.

03:55.627 --> 03:56.627
I'm so excited.

03:56.645 --> 03:58.646
- Great.
- Yup.

04:01.650 --> 04:03.935
What are we gonna do?

04:03.969 --> 04:06.554
She's not bad. She's just...

04:06.588 --> 04:09.907
- What's the word?
- Bad?

04:09.942 --> 04:12.410
She's got the beat, she's on key.

04:12.444 --> 04:14.144
- She's just--
- Loud.

04:14.163 --> 04:15.997
That's the word.

04:16.031 --> 04:19.016
If she didn't sing so loudly,
what would it be?

04:19.051 --> 04:20.750
I don't have time for this.
They said she could sing.

04:20.786 --> 04:22.653
Her Agent, her manager.
Everyone said she could sing.

04:22.671 --> 04:24.989
Yeah, well that should have
been the tip-off right there.

04:25.023 --> 04:27.441
<i>Didn't you see Rebecca Duvall
sing on Saturday night live?</i>

04:27.476 --> 04:29.844
One of you said she was "awesome."

04:29.878 --> 04:31.612
- Wasn't me.
- Wasn't me.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.264
I think it was me.

04:33.298 --> 04:35.933
I think I said
she was utterly charismatic.

04:35.968 --> 04:38.519
Which of course she is.

04:38.554 --> 04:40.972
Listen, Rebecca Duvall is never
gonna be an opera singer.

04:41.006 --> 04:43.307
But she's gonna be great.

04:43.341 --> 04:47.011
She's gonna tear up the scenery,
she's gonna fill the seats.

04:47.029 --> 04:48.529
What we need to do

04:48.564 --> 04:53.501
is to find a constructive solution.

04:53.535 --> 04:56.454
Group suicide?

04:56.488 --> 04:59.457
Okay, um, we'll
use the "shadow selves."

04:59.491 --> 05:02.326
Give them some songs.

05:02.360 --> 05:04.212
The Cartwright girl, maybe.

05:04.246 --> 05:07.465
Or we bring back Ivy.

05:07.499 --> 05:08.549
Put her in the mix.

05:08.584 --> 05:11.135
- Ivy?
- Oh, come on.

05:11.169 --> 05:13.788
<i>Okay, so she screwed up royally
at heaven on earth.</i>

05:13.822 --> 05:15.239
But don't you think
she's been crucified enough

05:15.274 --> 05:16.991
for that already?
Seriously.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.659
What, you're gonna
consign her to cruise ships

05:18.694 --> 05:20.645
for the rest of her life?
She's bloody talented.

05:20.679 --> 05:23.648
- I don't know.
- Guys, she's had a rough patch.

05:23.682 --> 05:25.149
But she's fine.

05:25.183 --> 05:26.918
And be honest, we need her.

05:26.952 --> 05:28.719
Look, we all hope
Rebecca Duvall can do this,

05:28.754 --> 05:30.738
but God forbid she can't,
and the Cartwright girl

05:30.772 --> 05:33.591
is still too green
and we all know that.

05:33.625 --> 05:37.194
We need Ivy back in the show.

05:37.228 --> 05:40.164
Those shadow selves
were supposed to be whispers.

05:40.198 --> 05:43.367
Whispers in Marilyn's mind,
not songs.

05:43.401 --> 05:44.835
Whispers!

05:44.870 --> 05:46.921
This is just an excuse
to bring Ivy back.

05:46.955 --> 05:48.506
Hey, we love Ivy.

05:48.540 --> 05:49.840
If we're gonna
have two more Marilyn's,

05:49.875 --> 05:51.208
one of them might as well be her.

05:51.242 --> 05:54.178
The real Marilyn
has to be able to sing.

05:54.212 --> 05:58.549
Take a breath,
we will figure something out.

05:58.583 --> 06:00.434
Okay, you can't
just stand there and act

06:00.469 --> 06:02.419
you weren't freaking out about
this whole thing this morning.

06:02.437 --> 06:05.239
I was, wasn't I?

06:05.274 --> 06:07.391
But now I'm clearheaded and optimistic.

06:07.425 --> 06:10.528
And it's your turn to freak out.

06:10.562 --> 06:12.563
You're just in a good mood
'cause you have a date

06:12.597 --> 06:14.398
with your chorus crush.

06:14.432 --> 06:15.866
Thanks to me.

06:15.901 --> 06:18.569
Me, me, me.

06:20.438 --> 06:24.041
Oh, hey, maybe that's Derek
with some more bright ideas.

06:24.076 --> 06:26.410
Leo's school?

06:26.444 --> 06:28.412
Hello?

06:31.833 --> 06:33.968
Hey.

06:34.002 --> 06:36.253
I just saw Rebecca on the elevator,

06:36.287 --> 06:38.472
and she said she thought
my shoes were cute.

06:38.507 --> 06:40.725
I still haven't worked up
the courage to meet her.

06:40.759 --> 06:44.762
You have the perfect in.
You're her understudy.

06:44.796 --> 06:47.965
- Oh, my God.
- Hi!

06:47.983 --> 06:50.651
- Hello, beautiful.
- Where you been all my life?

06:50.686 --> 06:53.988
Oh, thank you.
So what'd I miss?

06:54.022 --> 06:56.107
I got a new cell phone
and some hack stole your part.

06:56.141 --> 06:58.159
Other than that, absolutely nothing.

06:58.193 --> 06:59.810
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:59.828 --> 07:02.079
What's she doing back here?

07:02.114 --> 07:05.499
Can't say I'm surprised,
given who she's sleeping with.

07:05.534 --> 07:07.818
Hi, guys.

07:07.836 --> 07:10.021
Hi.

07:10.055 --> 07:12.289
What does this mean for me?

07:12.323 --> 07:16.877

Hey, I'm so glad I got you.

11:08.278 --> 11:09.862
Where are you?

11:09.896 --> 11:11.831
I called the office,
they said to try your cell.

11:11.865 --> 11:13.199
Oh, I'm covering an event.
Yeah, I'd better run actually.

11:13.233 --> 11:14.417
Okay.

11:14.451 --> 11:15.734
Any word on the press secretary job?

11:15.752 --> 11:17.553
Sorry, hon, I really need to go.

11:17.587 --> 11:19.505
- Sure.
- Talk later.

11:19.539 --> 11:22.407
Love you.

11:28.965 --> 11:36.972
♪ ♪

11:47.734 --> 11:49.735
Thank you for meeting me.
I really appreciate it.

11:49.769 --> 11:52.188
What's going on with Leo?

11:52.222 --> 11:56.441
Well, he's flunking
two classes, apparently.

11:56.460 --> 11:59.078
Calculus and American history.

11:59.112 --> 12:01.247
Here's a kid who never
got less than a "B" plus.

12:01.281 --> 12:03.749
You think I don't know that?

12:03.783 --> 12:05.468
I wasn't saying that.

12:05.502 --> 12:08.620
Who do you think
was home with him every day

12:08.638 --> 12:10.372
after school?

12:10.407 --> 12:14.059
Can we just table
the "us" part of this?

12:14.094 --> 12:16.729
I know you're angry,
and you have every right to be.

12:16.763 --> 12:19.265
- But this is about Leo.
- It's all connected, Julia.

12:19.299 --> 12:20.766
Do you think it's a coincidence

12:20.800 --> 12:22.401
that he's suddenly
checked out of school?

12:22.435 --> 12:25.070
No, of course it isn't.
It's my fault.

12:25.105 --> 12:28.657
It's my fault.
It's all my fault.

12:28.692 --> 12:30.659
But we've gotta deal with this
before we sit down

12:30.694 --> 12:33.195
with the guidance counselor
on Thursday.

12:33.246 --> 12:37.416
You lied to me,
and betrayed our marriage.

12:37.450 --> 12:43.172
And then you did it again
five years later.

12:43.206 --> 12:46.292
I have nothing to say.

12:50.397 --> 12:55.434
Thanks so much.

12:55.468 --> 13:00.973
Okay, sorry,
um, I just...

13:01.007 --> 13:04.226
Derek, um, I just
had a few thoughts

13:04.277 --> 13:05.778
I'd love to run by you.

13:05.812 --> 13:07.696
Is this a bad time
for a quick pow-wow?

13:07.731 --> 13:11.033
- No, it's a perfect time.
- Great.

13:11.067 --> 13:14.069
He used to lay into you
for raising the wrong eyebrow.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.989
That's because he knew
I'd get it right eventually.

13:17.023 --> 13:18.908
With her, what's the point?

13:18.959 --> 13:20.826
This ain't over, you mark my words.

13:20.860 --> 13:23.162
You know who's going to wind up
playing Marilyn, don't you?

13:23.196 --> 13:25.965
Gwyneth paltrow?

13:25.999 --> 13:30.085
So...Marilyn Monroe,
she was part of the, you know,

13:30.136 --> 13:32.972
- the actor's studio.
- Mm-hm.

13:33.006 --> 13:36.008
We should see it.
The classes, the characters.

13:36.042 --> 13:38.644
Okay, the problem with that
is that in this scene

13:38.678 --> 13:40.896
we just don't really have enough
time to get into all of that.

13:40.931 --> 13:42.398
But that's exactly my point.

13:42.432 --> 13:43.682
There really isn't time
in any of the scenes

13:43.716 --> 13:45.100
to dig into her psyche.

13:45.151 --> 13:46.785
They're too short.

13:46.820 --> 13:49.488
I mean, personally,
I'd rather see longer scenes

13:49.522 --> 13:50.940
and a little less
singing and dancing.

13:50.991 --> 13:53.325
Heh, well,
it is a musical after all.

13:53.360 --> 13:56.028
Yeah, but it doesn't mean
it can't be deep and smart.

13:56.062 --> 13:58.747
I mean, and that song, it's boring.

13:58.782 --> 13:59.999
I mean, it should be more fun.

14:00.033 --> 14:01.450
Okay, you know what?

14:01.501 --> 14:05.337
Um, this sounds like
a longer conversation.

14:05.372 --> 14:07.957
Wha...Uh...

14:08.008 --> 14:09.808
I'm driving you crazy, aren't I?

14:09.843 --> 14:12.628
- No, not at all.
- Yes, yes, I am, I know.

14:12.679 --> 14:15.598
I'm such a pain in the ass.

14:18.084 --> 14:21.103
Boring!
She thinks my music is boring.

14:21.137 --> 14:22.771
It might be a little less boring

14:22.806 --> 14:24.607
if she could actually sing it on key.

14:24.641 --> 14:26.025
"More fun."

14:26.059 --> 14:27.610
What blindingly insightful criticism.

14:27.644 --> 14:29.194
"More fun."

14:29.229 --> 14:30.312
I don't give a damn if it's fun or not,

14:30.363 --> 14:31.680
if she could just learn it.

14:31.715 --> 14:33.983
That would actually be more fun for me

14:34.034 --> 14:35.701
if she would learn the song!

14:35.735 --> 14:38.954
Hey, where did Julia say
this restaurant was again?

14:38.989 --> 14:40.539
You know, I'm too wound up to eat.

14:40.573 --> 14:43.459
When I get like this
my stomach just shuts down.

14:43.493 --> 14:44.827
Yeah, okay.

14:44.878 --> 14:48.297
I'm not that hungry either.

14:48.331 --> 14:51.634
So what do you wanna do?

14:52.919 --> 14:55.804
<i>Into the woods.</i>

14:55.839 --> 14:57.973
Hmm, mm-hm.

14:58.008 --> 15:02.561
For me, it's the frogs.

15:02.595 --> 15:06.899
But I'm weird.

15:18.611 --> 15:22.247
- Mmm.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

15:22.282 --> 15:26.085
- Wait?
- Just moving a little fast.

15:26.119 --> 15:27.453
Fast?

15:27.487 --> 15:30.122
I'm kind of old-fashioned,
okay?

15:30.156 --> 15:32.207
Really?

15:32.258 --> 15:33.842
Yeah.

15:33.877 --> 15:37.262
Like, um, I go to church
and believe in God and stuff.

15:37.297 --> 15:40.749
So I kind of think of this as holy.

15:40.784 --> 15:42.468
Wait a minute.

15:42.502 --> 15:46.605
- Sex is holy?
- Yeah.

15:46.639 --> 15:49.274
Yeah, man, I think that.

15:49.309 --> 15:51.243
Are you a republican too?

15:51.277 --> 15:53.729
'Cause I dated one of them
and it didn't work out so well.

15:53.780 --> 15:57.549
Republicans don't own God,
you know that.

15:57.584 --> 15:59.952
Do I?

15:59.986 --> 16:04.039
Look, I like you.

16:04.074 --> 16:08.744
I just wanna slow things down.
Hang out outside of rehearsal.

16:08.795 --> 16:11.096
Do things.

16:11.131 --> 16:12.414
Go to a Knicks game?

16:12.465 --> 16:14.583
That idea strikes you as crazy?

16:14.634 --> 16:17.052
Mm.

16:17.087 --> 16:19.388
- Okay.
- No, no, come on.

16:19.422 --> 16:25.060
No, this is just unusual.
You have to admit it.

16:25.095 --> 16:26.645
How old are you?

16:26.679 --> 16:30.649
37...ish.

16:30.683 --> 16:32.735
And what's your
longest relationship?

16:32.769 --> 16:34.770
Um...

16:34.821 --> 16:37.456
Five years....

16:37.490 --> 16:38.624
Months.

16:38.658 --> 16:39.775
Okay.

16:39.826 --> 16:42.161
Okay, I know you, you know.

16:42.195 --> 16:45.831
You meet somebody,
you jump right into something

16:45.865 --> 16:47.666
and then you start
looking for reasons to bail.

16:47.700 --> 16:50.252
Am I right?

16:50.286 --> 16:52.871
Trust me.

16:52.905 --> 16:55.907
My way is better.

17:13.742 --> 17:15.343
Yeah, Eileen, it's Mark at CAA.

17:15.377 --> 17:17.316
Sorry we keep missing each other.

17:17.316 --> 17:20.417
I trust you're enjoying
the fabulous Rebecca Duvall.

17:20.453 --> 17:21.953
You said she could sing, Mark.

17:26.291 --> 17:28.209
Hi, Eileen, it's Nick.

17:28.243 --> 17:31.379
You remember me--tall,
dark and extremely handsome.

17:31.414 --> 17:33.999
Just, uh, wanna say hi.

17:34.033 --> 17:35.917
So call me the old-fashioned way.

17:58.107 --> 18:00.609
Eileen.

18:00.660 --> 18:01.943
Ellis.

18:01.994 --> 18:03.078
I thought you'd left already.

18:03.112 --> 18:04.829
I was about to.

18:04.864 --> 18:06.748
I just wanted to make sure
that you got this latest email

18:06.782 --> 18:08.333
about Rebecca's issues.

18:08.367 --> 18:09.918
There are more?

18:09.952 --> 18:11.136
"No one is allowed to smoke within

18:11.170 --> 18:12.170
"100 feet of her.

18:12.204 --> 18:13.638
"We must provide a blender

18:13.673 --> 18:15.273
"for her daily
kale-and-flaxseed smoothies.

18:15.308 --> 18:16.808
She's allergic to peanuts--"

18:16.842 --> 18:20.795
Yeah, okay, I'll deal with it tomorrow.

18:20.846 --> 18:23.348
Uh, actually there's something else.

18:23.382 --> 18:26.217
She sent me out for gum earlier
while her assistants

18:26.251 --> 18:27.886
<i>were just sitting around
reading US weekly.</i>

18:27.920 --> 18:29.854
I think they think I work for them.

18:29.889 --> 18:33.892
Ellis, lesson number one.

18:33.926 --> 18:37.195
Keep your enemies close,
and celebrities even closer.

18:37.229 --> 18:39.731
And their assistants closer yet.

18:39.765 --> 18:43.618
There's power in proximity
as I think you already know.

18:43.653 --> 18:45.654
Fair enough.

18:45.705 --> 18:47.956
Was there something
you needed from my desk?

18:47.990 --> 18:50.141
No.

18:50.176 --> 18:53.161
Good night.

18:59.719 --> 19:02.387
All right, Nick.

19:02.421 --> 19:05.423
Let's see what's wrong with you?

19:11.697 --> 19:14.683
Great, another crook.

19:14.734 --> 19:18.520
So in my experience,
when a kid like Leo,

19:18.554 --> 19:21.589
who is normally engaged and motivated,

19:21.624 --> 19:24.025
suddenly checks out,

19:24.076 --> 19:26.494
there's usually something going on at home

19:26.529 --> 19:31.249
that might be a contributing factor.

19:31.283 --> 19:33.918
- Well, actually--
- No, no, he's been fine.

19:33.953 --> 19:36.254
A little moody,
but aren't all 17-year-olds?

19:36.288 --> 19:40.041
True, but they're not all
suddenly failing classes

19:40.076 --> 19:42.510
they once excelled in.

19:42.545 --> 19:46.681
So there's nothing going on
that we should know about?

19:46.716 --> 19:48.800
Death in the family?
Illness?

19:48.834 --> 19:51.770
- Financial strain?
- Nope.

19:51.804 --> 19:53.555
Okay.

19:53.606 --> 19:56.357
- Then in that case--
- Stop lying.

19:56.392 --> 19:59.110
We've been living apart
for a few weeks now.

19:59.145 --> 20:01.396
I was unfaithful so Frank moved out.

20:01.447 --> 20:03.531
Yeah.

20:03.566 --> 20:06.785
I had an affair, which was
totally and completely wrong

20:06.819 --> 20:08.536
on every level.

20:08.571 --> 20:10.905
And Leo found out about it.

20:10.956 --> 20:13.158
Before Frank did, actually.

20:13.192 --> 20:14.793
But then Frank found out about it.

20:14.827 --> 20:17.712
And then things with Leo got worse.

20:17.747 --> 20:19.798
But then better.

20:19.832 --> 20:23.134
But then worse again, obviously,
if he's flunking out of school.

20:23.169 --> 20:24.502
So I pretty much ruined everything

20:24.536 --> 20:26.471
and now here we are.

20:26.505 --> 20:29.474
Did I leave anything out?

20:32.762 --> 20:35.764
Next.

20:42.238 --> 20:44.773
I'm Marilyn Monroe.

20:44.824 --> 20:47.776
And I...

20:47.827 --> 20:49.727
I'm so thankful to be here.

20:49.745 --> 20:51.746
How can you be thankful
before you know

20:51.781 --> 20:53.748
if I can teach you anything?

20:54.834 --> 20:56.067
I don't know.

What do yfeel?</i>

21:00.840 --> 21:02.240
Heh...

I guess.

21:05.194 --> 21:07.645
I want you to like me so much.

21:07.680 --> 21:10.515
And I'm afraid I'm not
gonna be any good at this.

And I really want to be good.

This scene, it's just getting started

? Break into song ?

21:27.817 --> 21:29.267
You know what?

21:29.285 --> 21:31.619
Uh, this sounds like
a sidebar conversation.

I didn't want to interrupt
the rehearsal, the--

21:33.322 --> 21:34.873
Not to worry.

21:34.907 --> 21:36.925
I think everyone could
probably do with a break.

Okay, that's ten.

Hey.

Um, I actually have some time
to get together tonight.

22:05.271 --> 22:07.138
Is that so?

22:07.156 --> 22:08.690
Yeah, I know you've seen
Rebecca's movie 100 times.

we could catch a screening,

maybe get a bite after?

Uh, I've seen it 200 times.

22:14.413 --> 22:17.365
What the hell, Rebecca.
You never called me back.

22:17.416 --> 22:18.867
I'm working, Colin!

Sorry, this is a closed rehearsal.

22:20.369 --> 22:22.203
Randall, he's drunk.
Make him go.

This is crazy.

22:34.884 --> 22:37.936
Get out!

22:41.577 --> 22:44.423
No, I'm not aware of any ruckus
at the rehearsal today.

That is, of course, aside
from the roof being raised

of Houston and Levitt.

the New York Times.</i>

23:00.441 --> 23:03.910
Even they have gotten
into the gossip biz.

23:03.944 --> 23:06.012
So her singing
is a train wreck,

23:06.046 --> 23:07.447
and so is her personal life.

23:07.481 --> 23:09.732
We're doubly blessed.

23:09.750 --> 23:11.751
Rebecca Duvall did not get
to the top of the A-list

23:11.785 --> 23:15.755
by being simple or by having
healthy romantic relationships.

23:15.789 --> 23:17.590
Neither did Marilyn.

23:17.625 --> 23:19.375
She's still Rebecca Duvall.

23:19.409 --> 23:21.844
And if she wants you
to write an extra-long scene

23:21.879 --> 23:24.547
<i>before dig deep, you will
write that extra-long scene</i>

23:24.581 --> 23:28.017
and you will have it
on my desk by 5:00, understood?

23:43.701 --> 23:44.934
Marilyn.

23:44.952 --> 23:46.352
You can't stay away, can you?

23:46.387 --> 23:48.237
What are you doing in Dev's office?

23:48.272 --> 23:50.073
Uh, you mean my office.

23:50.107 --> 23:54.043
Yeah, I did a little re-org
when I became press secretary.

23:54.078 --> 23:56.496
- You're press-secretary?
- Damn straight.

23:56.547 --> 23:59.799
Doesn't your boyfriend tell you anything?

24:05.322 --> 24:07.757
I didn't say I loved it,
I said I couldn't put it down.

24:07.791 --> 24:10.459
Well, I'm sorry but
that is a friendship-ender.

24:10.477 --> 24:12.345
That is so unfair,
you didn't even finish the book.

24:12.396 --> 24:14.130
Because it was so bad.

24:14.148 --> 24:15.264
What!!

24:17.801 --> 24:21.688
Hey, Karen.

24:21.739 --> 24:23.239
What are you doing here?

24:23.273 --> 24:26.308
What are you doing here?

24:26.327 --> 24:27.610
When were you going to tell me

24:27.644 --> 24:30.196
that that Weasel got press-secretary?

24:30.247 --> 24:32.749
- Eventually.
- Eventually? When?

24:32.783 --> 24:34.316
Well, I don't know,
you've been pretty wrapped up

24:34.335 --> 24:36.119
in the show lately--
and Rebecca Duvall and all that.

24:36.153 --> 24:38.321
So it's my fault
you don't talk to me anymore?

24:38.355 --> 24:40.456
Looks like you're talking to her plenty.

24:40.490 --> 24:42.375
Whoa, it's not exactly like we've been

24:42.426 --> 24:44.093
on the same page lately.

24:44.128 --> 24:45.712
How can we be on the same page
when you're not even

24:45.763 --> 24:47.163
telling me what page you're on?

24:47.181 --> 24:48.998
I mean, how long ago
did this thing happen?

24:49.033 --> 24:50.600
Is there anything else
I should know about?

24:50.634 --> 24:52.301
You seem to be more upset
about not knowing

24:52.335 --> 24:54.387
than the actual news.

24:54.438 --> 24:57.607
You know how badly
I wanted this job.

25:00.928 --> 25:02.478
I'm so sorry.

25:02.512 --> 25:06.282
You're right.

25:06.316 --> 25:07.817
Hey, there's a special screening tonight

25:07.851 --> 25:09.351
of Rebecca's new movie.

25:09.370 --> 25:11.454
I think that might
help take your mind off things?

25:11.488 --> 25:13.623
- Uh, no, no, thanks.
- Oh, come on.

25:13.657 --> 25:15.024
<i>It's the sequel to Casual Fridays.</i>

25:15.042 --> 25:16.525
You loved the first one.

25:16.543 --> 25:18.795
We haven't laughed together
in a long time.

25:18.829 --> 25:21.848
Think about it, please?

25:21.882 --> 25:23.666
Sure.

25:47.357 --> 25:49.992
Hey, Nick.

25:50.027 --> 25:52.328
Yes, it's Eileen.

25:52.362 --> 25:56.199
I'm sorry it's taken so long
for me to get back to you but...

25:56.233 --> 25:59.669
the thing is, I'm very busy
and I just can't be distracted

25:59.703 --> 26:01.337
from the show right now.

26:01.371 --> 26:02.538
Wait--aagh!

26:02.572 --> 26:04.740
Wait a second.

26:04.758 --> 26:08.177
Are you breaking up with me
after one kiss?

26:08.212 --> 26:09.411
What, my breath that bad?

26:09.430 --> 26:11.347
Oh, hi, Nick.

26:11.381 --> 26:15.417
Well, um, it's just that
I realized how unrealistic it is

26:15.436 --> 26:18.521
for me to get involved
with anyone right now

26:18.555 --> 26:20.690
when I'm so busy.

26:20.724 --> 26:22.591
Whatever you're
about to say, Ms. busy,

26:22.609 --> 26:24.811
I think I deserve to hear it in person.

26:24.862 --> 26:27.196
- Don't you?
- Okay.

26:27.231 --> 26:30.483
How about tonight?

26:30.534 --> 26:32.869
That sounds perfect.

26:32.903 --> 26:36.539
- Okay.
- Okay.

26:41.278 --> 26:42.545
- Eileen?
- Hi!

26:42.579 --> 26:45.081
Uh...

26:45.115 --> 26:46.749
Sorry to pop in on you like this

26:46.783 --> 26:49.502
but I just wanna say thanks
for another great day.

26:49.553 --> 26:52.004
- I'm having so much fun.
- Oh, good.

26:52.055 --> 26:54.891
Well, I was actually
just about to call you

26:54.925 --> 26:56.592
to find out if you're okay.

26:56.626 --> 26:58.394
Your unexpected friend?

26:58.428 --> 27:00.880
Oh, Colin?

27:00.914 --> 27:02.982
Oh, he's harmless, just annoying.

27:03.016 --> 27:05.467
Oh, good, because
I've had more than my share

27:05.486 --> 27:07.186
of troublesome men in my life.

27:07.237 --> 27:09.805
No, I can handle him.

27:09.823 --> 27:11.607
He does this about
every four months.

27:11.641 --> 27:13.976
Anyway, the real reason I came by

27:13.994 --> 27:16.746
is to talk about the scene.

27:16.780 --> 27:20.449
I just got the pages from Julia.

27:20.483 --> 27:21.751
It's inspired.

27:21.785 --> 27:23.586
She's such a talent.

27:23.620 --> 27:25.204
Mm, I agree.

27:25.255 --> 27:26.989
In fact, it gave me
so many other ideas

27:27.007 --> 27:29.258
on how to deepen the rest of the show.

27:29.293 --> 27:30.893
Oh.

27:30.928 --> 27:33.162
I'd love to get everyone
together for a pow-wow.

27:33.180 --> 27:34.297
I'm supposed to be
at this screening tonight,

27:34.331 --> 27:35.932
but I can blow it off.

27:35.966 --> 27:38.935
Frankly, this project is
so much more important to me.

27:38.969 --> 27:41.554
Well, good. I'll rally the troops.

27:41.605 --> 27:44.557
So good.

27:44.608 --> 27:47.059
- See you tonight.
- Bye.

27:54.034 --> 27:55.451
Derek?

27:55.485 --> 27:57.403
It seems our movie star
has requested

27:57.454 --> 28:00.373
yet another work session--
buckle up.

28:03.069 --> 28:04.504
Welcome.

28:04.504 --> 28:07.138
Thank You.
Thanks you for hosting.

28:07.594 --> 28:09.363
Well, on the plus side,
at least we didn't have to

28:09.363 --> 28:10.643
sit through her movie.

28:10.643 --> 28:12.219
I was excited about the movie.

28:12.219 --> 28:15.050
- Me too.
- Me too.

28:15.050 --> 28:17.652
I was.
I loved the first one.

28:17.652 --> 28:20.024
Guys, I think she's a great actress.

28:20.024 --> 28:21.980
She just can't sing.

28:21.980 --> 28:23.872
Which may no longer be an issue

28:23.872 --> 28:26.100
considering I'm writing
a four-hour drama.

28:26.189 --> 28:28.946
Well, I've already decided
if she asks to expand

28:28.946 --> 28:31.093
on other scenes,
we're gonna say no.

28:31.093 --> 28:32.132
- What?
- Huh?

28:32.132 --> 28:35.564
Well, you've already written
a marvelous musical

28:35.564 --> 28:37.235
and I want to keep it that way.

28:37.235 --> 28:38.777
Hallelujah.

28:39.720 --> 28:42.006
I heard she wants
all new musical numbers.

28:42.006 --> 28:43.404
Yeah, and I heard
she wants them all axed.

28:43.404 --> 28:45.048
So if they're axing
her musical numbers,

28:45.048 --> 28:45.990
what happens to us?

28:45.990 --> 28:48.966
Guys, can you please stop
spreading bad information?

28:48.966 --> 28:50.287
You're gonna start a panic.

28:50.287 --> 28:51.734
Panic about what?

28:51.734 --> 28:54.085
See? Look what you've done already.

28:54.085 --> 28:56.350
Relax, they're just stirring the pot.

28:56.350 --> 28:57.915
Everything's going to be fine.

28:57.915 --> 28:59.307
See you all in there.

28:59.307 --> 29:01.884
Yeah, I'm gonna go grab some seats.

29:01.884 --> 29:03.981
- Want me to save you one?
- No, I'm waiting for Dev.

29:03.981 --> 29:07.835
Oh, so I finally get
to meet the famous boyfriend.

29:07.835 --> 29:08.944
That's right,
you've never met Dev.

29:08.944 --> 29:10.084
- Nope.
- He's great.

29:10.084 --> 29:14.418
- Little bit of a temper?
- Mm, you heard about that.

29:14.418 --> 29:16.244
Sounded like an interesting night.

29:16.244 --> 29:17.632
It was all a misunderstanding.

29:17.632 --> 29:19.463
Oh, I know I know,
I completely know.

29:19.463 --> 29:21.976
Gee, I hope he makes it in time.

29:21.976 --> 29:24.165
Looks like they're about to start.

29:31.008 --> 29:33.131
Hey, Ellis, everything okay?

29:33.131 --> 29:34.076
Yeah, what's the address?

29:35.981 --> 29:37.647
Uh-huh.
Oh, hold on.

29:37.647 --> 29:38.457
I got another call.

29:40.129 --> 29:42.051
Hey, Cyn.
Sorry about tonight.

29:42.051 --> 29:44.018
I just--I gotta suck up
to that loser again.

29:44.018 --> 29:46.808
Cyn? Hello?

29:46.808 --> 29:49.751
Uh, it's not Cyn.

29:49.751 --> 29:51.606
It's just that "loser."

29:51.606 --> 29:54.147
Don't bother coming.

30:32.279 --> 30:34.335
Are you as bored as I am in there?

30:34.335 --> 30:36.802
No, it's funny.
I'm just distracted.

30:36.802 --> 30:38.960
Don't lie, she's annoying.

30:38.960 --> 30:42.121
She stole our part.
We hate her.

30:42.663 --> 30:44.539
Come on,
we're getting a drink.

30:44.539 --> 30:45.659
Ugh!

30:46.690 --> 30:49.267
Ugh! How much longer is she
gonna keep us waiting?

30:49.267 --> 30:50.641
This is ridiculous.

30:50.641 --> 30:54.738
So you never told me,
how was your date with Sam?

30:57.125 --> 30:58.562
He believes in God.

30:58.562 --> 31:02.208
Oh. I'm sorry.

31:02.208 --> 31:05.766
A lot of people
believe in God, Julia.

31:05.766 --> 31:08.632
You don't have to tell me.
I believe in God.

31:10.071 --> 31:10.884
You do?

31:10.884 --> 31:13.460
Tom, a lot of people
believe in God.

31:13.460 --> 31:15.300
I know.

31:15.708 --> 31:19.578
I just--it's just
not something I talk about.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.265
He got you talking about God.

31:22.265 --> 31:23.324
Good for him.

31:23.324 --> 31:25.929
Oh, he called me out
on all of my stuff.

31:25.929 --> 31:26.254
Mm?

31:26.254 --> 31:28.354
Said I was afraid of intimacy.

31:29.008 --> 31:30.539
Afraid of commitment.

31:30.539 --> 31:31.698
I'm paraphrasing.

31:31.698 --> 31:34.348
And that's why
I'm still alone at my age.

31:34.348 --> 31:36.832
I've said that to you
every day since I met you.

31:36.832 --> 31:40.919
Please don't
make this about yourself.

31:41.160 --> 31:44.879
I know, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry.

31:44.879 --> 31:46.547
I got hung up on this phone call

31:46.581 --> 31:48.348
with this charter school
in Harlem and I'm on the board--

31:48.383 --> 31:51.218
It's okay.

31:51.252 --> 31:55.556
- Anyway, a thousand apologies.
- Rebecca, hi.

31:57.925 --> 31:58.925
- Hi.
- Hi.

31:58.943 --> 32:00.561
What'd I miss?

32:00.595 --> 32:05.265
Uh, well, we really
appreciate hearing your thoughts

32:05.283 --> 32:08.268
about wanting to roll back
on the songs.

32:08.286 --> 32:09.319
Right.

32:09.370 --> 32:11.271
But, um, moving forward--

32:11.289 --> 32:13.440
You wanna keep the music
numbers in their entirety.

32:13.458 --> 32:14.892
Right?

32:14.926 --> 32:18.111
- Mm-hm.
- Fine.

32:18.129 --> 32:19.546
I get it.
It's a musical.

32:19.581 --> 32:22.249
People want to hear
a bunch of songs.

32:22.283 --> 32:24.885
Okay, great.

32:24.919 --> 32:28.839
Um, which brings us
to the songs themselves.

32:28.890 --> 32:32.242
Um, we really do appreciate
your thoughts about the songs--

32:32.277 --> 32:35.345
Guys, if we're
gonna work together,

32:35.396 --> 32:37.948
you can't be so afraid
to tell me the truth.

32:37.982 --> 32:40.968
Trust me, I wanna be
as good out there

32:41.002 --> 32:43.387
as you want me to be.

32:43.421 --> 32:45.639
So let's get down to work.

32:45.673 --> 32:48.742
Right off the bat,
I suggest that you lower the key

32:48.776 --> 32:50.527
in all the songs.

32:50.578 --> 32:54.598
Giving me more vocal support
and cutting back on the solos.

32:54.632 --> 32:57.885
<i>And Tom, look, I know you don't
want to touch dig deep,</i>

32:57.919 --> 33:01.388
but I just can't handle
that kind of ballad.

33:01.422 --> 33:03.874
Understood.

33:03.925 --> 33:06.126
Thank you.

33:06.160 --> 33:09.963
And I was thinking
about hiring a vocal coach.

33:09.997 --> 33:12.733
- Is that a good idea?
- Yes.

33:12.767 --> 33:15.769
<i>I could do let's be bad
in my sleep.</i>

33:15.803 --> 33:17.771
<i>And Mr. and Mrs. Smith.</i>

33:17.805 --> 33:19.172
Know 'em both.

33:19.190 --> 33:20.340
<i>- History?
- Know it.</i>

33:20.358 --> 33:22.059
<i>Wolf?</i>

33:22.110 --> 33:23.393
<i>Heart, Mambo, plus
I know all the new scenes</i>

33:23.444 --> 33:26.396
- backwards and forwards.
- Uh, please.

33:26.447 --> 33:28.482
I'm sleeping with the director.

33:28.516 --> 33:31.034
I basically blocked the whole show.

33:31.069 --> 33:33.620
Well, I'm still the understudy
last time I checked.

33:33.655 --> 33:35.739
Honey, when Rebecca Duvall
goes down,

33:35.790 --> 33:37.624
everything's up for grabs.

33:37.659 --> 33:39.859
You're gonna
have to pry that part

33:39.878 --> 33:41.411
out of my cold, dead hands.

33:41.462 --> 33:45.499
Mm. Really?

33:45.533 --> 33:48.702
Well, I have one word for you...
"Unstable."

33:48.720 --> 33:51.421
Please.
Who isn't around here?

33:54.809 --> 33:57.477
So what happened to Mr. perfect?

33:57.512 --> 33:59.930
I never said he was perfect.

33:59.964 --> 34:02.182
He's actually having
a lot of trouble at work,

34:02.216 --> 34:04.151
so he's really down.

34:04.185 --> 34:05.686
So what are you doing here with me?

34:05.720 --> 34:07.437
He's probably letting somebody else

34:07.488 --> 34:09.322
cheer him up right now.

34:09.357 --> 34:11.858
And she's probably really hot.

34:13.027 --> 34:14.695
Ugh, that isn't funny.

34:14.728 --> 34:17.496
Oh, that struck a nerve.
Trouble in paradise?

34:17.532 --> 34:19.032
Ugh, why do I even talk to you?

34:19.065 --> 34:21.067
You make me feel bad.
I'm leaving.

34:21.085 --> 34:22.953
I'm just kidding.

34:23.004 --> 34:25.071
Well, now I feel bad.

34:25.089 --> 34:28.408
- Hey, I'll get this.
- No, you won't.

34:28.426 --> 34:31.678
You need to have
a thicker skin, Iowa.

34:31.713 --> 34:33.547
I told you
I finished my homework.

34:33.581 --> 34:35.349
What do you wanna do,
look it over and sign it

34:35.382 --> 34:36.850
like we did
in the fifth grade?

34:36.884 --> 34:38.869
If necessary,
because what we have here

34:38.902 --> 34:41.221
is completely unacceptable.

34:41.255 --> 34:43.072
Are you talking to me or to her?

34:43.107 --> 34:45.442
You're 17 years old now,
it's time you stop mouthing off

34:45.476 --> 34:47.077
and blaming everyone else
for your problems.

34:47.110 --> 34:48.512
Um, in case you haven't noticed,

34:48.545 --> 34:50.447
this has kind of been
a tough time for me!

34:50.481 --> 34:51.949
I don't care!

34:51.983 --> 34:54.451
And none of those colleges
are going to care.

34:54.485 --> 34:55.819
- Whoa.
- This is his junior year.

34:55.870 --> 34:57.955
- Everything counts.
- Counts for what?

34:57.989 --> 34:59.606
What's the point?

34:59.624 --> 35:01.625
So I can get into a good college
and meet someone nice

35:01.659 --> 35:02.960
and get married and have a kid

35:02.994 --> 35:05.111
and have it all blow up in my face?

35:05.129 --> 35:07.381
Hey, dial it down, both of you.

35:07.415 --> 35:09.416
Now.

35:12.754 --> 35:16.223
Look...

35:16.257 --> 35:18.608
This is a lousy time.

35:18.643 --> 35:20.227
And you didn't cause it.

35:20.261 --> 35:23.347
We all know that.

35:23.398 --> 35:26.033
But not matter what's
going on with us,

35:26.067 --> 35:28.068
you have to take care of yourself.

35:28.102 --> 35:29.353
And your future.

35:29.404 --> 35:31.571
I'm serious, Leo.

35:31.606 --> 35:33.390
We don't want you
to do something stupid

35:33.424 --> 35:39.079
because I did something stupid.

35:39.113 --> 35:43.800
We want to help you through this.

35:43.835 --> 35:47.804
If I get a "B" on my calculus exam...

35:47.839 --> 35:50.691
Do I get to meet Rebecca Duvall?

35:54.128 --> 35:59.332
"B" plus and we'll talk.

35:59.350 --> 36:02.386
Babe?
Hello?

36:04.772 --> 36:07.774
Babe?

36:16.367 --> 36:18.618
Thank you.

36:18.653 --> 36:20.520
So I need to tell you
my life story.

36:20.538 --> 36:23.073
Okay.

36:32.135 --> 36:35.004
Listen, I am going to cut to
the chase, Nick.

36:35.038 --> 36:38.057
I've heard that you have
some skeletons in your closet.

36:38.091 --> 36:41.227
Now I'm not here to judge,
but I want you to know

36:41.261 --> 36:44.780
I've had more than my share
of drama with unreliable men.

36:48.268 --> 36:50.102
Are you referring
to the business arrangement

36:50.153 --> 36:51.954
I have with the Reggione family?

36:51.989 --> 36:55.191
Why, is there something more?

36:55.225 --> 36:56.859
Well, you also be talking about

36:56.893 --> 36:59.979
the illegal Dominican guys
who did dishes at the bar.

37:00.013 --> 37:02.164
Well, is that all?

37:02.199 --> 37:05.501
No, there's quite
a bit more, in fact.

37:05.536 --> 37:07.286
Look, Eileen...

37:07.337 --> 37:08.671
You run a bar in the city

37:08.705 --> 37:10.523
you're gonna get your hands dirty.

37:10.557 --> 37:14.043
But if you're looking
for a way out of this with me,

37:14.077 --> 37:15.878
you're don't have to hire a Detective.

37:15.912 --> 37:19.715
Just tell me you're not interested.

37:19.749 --> 37:22.468
I'm not looking for a way out.

37:22.519 --> 37:25.054
It's just...

37:25.088 --> 37:27.473
I've been through a lot.

37:27.524 --> 37:28.808
Okay.

37:28.842 --> 37:30.977
So now we're
getting somewhere.

37:31.028 --> 37:33.229
And I'm out of practice.

37:33.263 --> 37:37.033
You can take this
as slow as you want.

37:37.067 --> 37:39.652
You're the one
who's always rushing around.

37:39.703 --> 37:42.688
I'm just such a...

37:48.011 --> 37:49.128
- Busy lady.
- Busy lady.

37:49.162 --> 37:51.047
Yeah.

37:55.919 --> 37:57.753

37:57.787 --> 38:00.806
- Uh, can I just say one thing?
- Save it, Ellis.

38:00.841 --> 38:02.675
You know, I thought
we kind of connected

38:02.726 --> 38:04.760
a few weeks ago, but I get it now.

38:04.794 --> 38:07.413
You were just using me
to get to Rebecca.

38:07.447 --> 38:10.516
And I hate users.

38:14.471 --> 38:16.489
Hey, Ellis,
how's it going in there?

38:16.523 --> 38:18.407
I don't know, actually.
