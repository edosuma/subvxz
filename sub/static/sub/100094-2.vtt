but, uh, I found your number
in my, uh, husband's jacket.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.605
Mark Warren.

02:28.022 --> 02:30.900
The police report said that Mark...

02:31.943 --> 02:32.777
tried to...

02:33.528 --> 02:35.280
save a stranger, which...

02:36.948 --> 02:38.032
sounds like Mark.

02:38.741 --> 02:41.202
See, I found your number in his jacket...

02:41.286 --> 02:42.162
[inhales]

02:42.245 --> 02:45.290
uh, which means
that you weren't strangers.

02:45.373 --> 02:46.207
Um...

02:49.502 --> 02:52.714
So, if there's something I should know
about my husband...

02:53.923 --> 02:55.425
And, um...

02:56.467 --> 02:59.554
I'm not accusing you of anything. I, uh...

03:01.264 --> 03:03.892
[exhales] I'm just trying to find out
who I was married to.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.060

I'm Deputy Miller.

03:57.528 --> 03:58.446
Nicole Warren.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.616
-You alone?
-No, my son.

04:01.699 --> 04:02.992
-He's sleeping.
-Hmm.

04:03.785 --> 04:04.744
Is there a problem?

04:06.204 --> 04:07.205
Have you seen this woman?

04:10.041 --> 04:10.875
No.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.210
Who is she?

04:12.627 --> 04:13.836
Her name's Jill Noonan.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.256
She owns a cabin
on the other side of the lake.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.007
She went missing last night

04:18.091 --> 04:19.801
-in the middle of that freak storm.
-Oh.

04:20.385 --> 04:23.721
Didn't last long, but Jill's boyfriend
said she went outside to check it out.

04:23.805 --> 04:25.181
Next thing he knew, she was gone.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.058
Of course, that's his story.

04:29.644 --> 04:31.437
See any strange people
around here last night?

04:35.108 --> 04:38.486
Well, if you see anything, give a call.
I'll be patrolling the area.

[Pat] <i>Uh, no. No, no.</i>

05:19.986 --> 05:22.280
What's up? What's...
You sound out of breath.

05:22.363 --> 05:23.990
I... I was just talking to a cop.

05:24.073 --> 05:25.783
Apparently, a woman went missing
at the lake.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.119
-Are you at the lake?
-[Nicole] <i>Yeah.</i>

05:28.202 --> 05:30.371
I just needed to get away
for a little bit, you know?

05:31.456 --> 05:32.332
Um...

05:33.458 --> 05:36.127
[inhales] Listen, what do you know
about Charlotte Tuck?

05:36.210 --> 05:37.045
[Pat] <i>Charlotte...</i>

05:37.128 --> 05:40.340
-You mean the-- the-- um...
<i>-The woman Mark died trying to save.</i>

05:40.423 --> 05:43.051
Yeah. [stammers] I don't know
anything about her. Why?

05:43.134 --> 05:46.387
You didn't know that he was going
to New Orleans to see her?

05:46.971 --> 05:49.140
[Pat] <i>He didn't tell me</i>
<i>he was going to New Orleans.</i>

05:49.223 --> 05:51.392
<i>And you remember how he was</i>
<i>those last couple months,</i>

05:51.476 --> 05:52.602
he wasn't saying much.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.645
Wait, why are you asking me this?

05:54.729 --> 05:58.024
[Nicole] <i>I found Charlotte's number</i>
<i>in Mark's jacket pocket,</i>

05:58.107 --> 05:59.525
which meant that he knew her

05:59.609 --> 06:01.819
or that he was going there
looking for her.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.488
[Pat] <i>Wh-Why?</i>

06:04.614 --> 06:05.573
[inhales]

06:05.656 --> 06:07.992
Oh, no. No, Nicole. He...

06:08.493 --> 06:10.453
He wasn't... That wasn't Mark, okay?

06:10.536 --> 06:12.955
Yeah, well... I mean, Mark wasn't Mark.

06:13.039 --> 06:15.958
[Pat] <i>You know what?</i>
<i>Just don't call that number, Nicole.</i>

06:16.042 --> 06:17.668
<i>Nothing good is gonna come of it.</i>

06:17.752 --> 06:18.586
[sobs]

06:18.669 --> 06:20.004
Ugh!

06:20.296 --> 06:22.090
Yeah, I... I left a message.

06:23.966 --> 06:24.926
<i>I...</i> [sniffles]

06:25.468 --> 06:28.304
<i>I don't know what was going on,</i>
<i>but something was going on,</i>

06:28.388 --> 06:30.723
and I feel like I'm losing my mind,
and I just...

06:30.807 --> 06:31.641
[sniffles]

06:32.016 --> 06:33.935
Everything I thought was real isn't,

06:34.018 --> 06:36.062
and I just...
I really need to talk to her.

06:36.145 --> 06:39.148
[Pat] <i>Okay, look.</i>
<i>She could be a nutjob for all we know.</i>

06:39.232 --> 06:40.066
All right?

06:40.149 --> 06:41.859
You're in a... a vulnerable state.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.569
She could prey on that,

06:43.653 --> 06:44.779
<i>come after you for money.</i>

06:44.862 --> 06:47.031
<i>So just let me do some research,</i>

06:47.115 --> 06:49.700
<i>figure out who she is</i>
<i>before you talk to her.</i>

06:50.368 --> 06:52.370
Okay, p-promise me
that you won't talk to her.

06:52.453 --> 06:55.164
Hey, look, I didn't call
to get you to do anything.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.499
[Pat] <i>No, I know. I know. I...</i>

06:56.582 --> 06:57.917

Um...

06:59.085 --> 06:59.919
Here, uh...

07:00.753 --> 07:02.422
Why don't you just, uh...

07:02.922 --> 07:04.549
give me her number, so I can--

07:04.632 --> 07:07.009
You know, actually,
I think I should just do this myself.

07:07.093 --> 07:09.178
Um, Mark would want me to do it.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.681
Don't tell me what Mark would want.

Sorry.

07:18.729 --> 07:20.731
He was like my brother, Nicole. [exhales]

07:22.775 --> 07:23.651
I know.

07:25.945 --> 07:26.779

07:34.245 --> 07:36.873
Uh, not until we get you under control.

07:44.088 --> 07:45.381
Dad was right here.

07:46.048 --> 07:46.924
I know.

07:47.508 --> 07:50.052
I just don't understand, you know?

07:50.136 --> 07:51.471
He was here. I saw him.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.556
[Nicole] Okay.

07:54.515 --> 07:57.602
Just... Here, come here. Let's...
Let's take a walk down to the lake.

08:02.440 --> 08:03.649
I got my powers.

08:04.233 --> 08:05.610
Maybe that's why he came back.

08:05.693 --> 08:07.195
You mean you brought him here?

08:07.653 --> 08:10.990
No, he wanted to help me,
or warn me, or...

08:11.449 --> 08:12.283
-something.
-Warn...

08:12.366 --> 08:13.367
Warn you about what?

08:13.451 --> 08:15.369
I don't know. Superhero stuff.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.705
But who were all those other people?

08:18.456 --> 08:20.750
Maybe they came to warn their kids.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.127
Maybe.

08:24.545 --> 08:26.005
How you feeling today, buddy?

Fine. Why?

-Can we go swimming?
-Not right now, buddy.

08:40.603 --> 08:43.189
-Did you try and bend the trees?
-They don't want to.

08:44.690 --> 08:47.652
Well, what about the fish in the water?
Can you try bringing them up again?

08:47.735 --> 08:49.237
Uh, I just had breakfast.

08:52.281 --> 08:53.115

08:53.199 --> 08:55.368
-Can you try and make this float?
-What are you doing?

I'm trying to find out what you can do,
or else we can't go back home.

You know what? Never mind.
How fast can you come back?

12:46.599 --> 12:49.852

[Rob] And you pitched articles.
That's good.

22:33.602 --> 22:35.937
Most of the stuff that you'd be handling
here at the hospital

22:36.021 --> 22:37.814
would be, you know, promotional events.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.525
Uh, so, 10Ks, blood drives,
things of that nature.

22:44.571 --> 22:46.114
I would just need you
to make sure you're....

22:46.198 --> 22:47.199
No, no, no, no.

22:47.282 --> 22:48.116
Miss Warren?

22:48.575 --> 22:49.409
Dion!

22:52.120 --> 22:53.330
Dion!

22:53.997 --> 22:55.415
Are you done yet?

22:55.499 --> 22:56.958
Pick up your stuff. Let's go.

22:57.459 --> 22:58.543
Yay!

22:59.294 --> 23:01.129
Hey. What's going on? Are you done?

23:01.505 --> 23:02.381
What happened?

23:02.464 --> 23:03.298
Dion...

23:04.216 --> 23:06.218
-I'm sorry.
-Thank you for your time, Miss Warren.

23:06.676 --> 23:08.178
-Girl, what did you do?
-Thank you.

23:09.304 --> 23:12.015
-She said we're going home.
-Okay. Bye, buddy.

23:12.099 --> 23:12.933
Bye.

23:13.809 --> 23:14.643
I'm sorry.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.895
Okay, wait till we get in the car.
I'm serious.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.232
Kat, you butt dialed me again.

23:20.315 --> 23:23.276
[Kat] <i>No, I actually meant</i>
<i>to call you this time.</i>

23:23.610 --> 23:24.820
-Ooh.
<i>-It's about Dion.</i>

23:24.903 --> 23:25.737
Is he okay?

23:26.196 --> 23:27.823
Yeah. He's fine.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.409
You... You see him
pretty regularly, right?

23:30.492 --> 23:32.411
I try to make it once a week,

23:32.494 --> 23:34.663
but Nicole's not always, you know...

23:35.038 --> 23:35.872
up for it.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.916
Do you feel like
she's trying to keep him from you?

23:38.291 --> 23:40.293
No, I think she has her hands full and--

23:40.377 --> 23:42.504
Uh, yeah, and you can be kind of annoying.

23:42.587 --> 23:43.797
Right, but ouch.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.048
Pat, you know I love you.

23:45.132 --> 23:47.050
<i>Does he ever say anything about her?</i>

23:47.134 --> 23:48.927
Is he ever upset by anything she's doing?

23:49.010 --> 23:53.223
Uh, he says she's sad sometimes,
but that makes sense. Why?

23:53.390 --> 23:54.558
She's just... She's...

23:55.016 --> 23:56.143
She's acting weird.

23:56.726 --> 23:58.061
She said that Dion...

23:59.396 --> 24:00.230
What?

24:01.148 --> 24:02.107
No, nothing.

24:02.732 --> 24:06.903
She used Dion as a reason
to mess up her job interview today.

24:06.987 --> 24:10.615
Oh, yeah. Yeah, he messaged me
to play Reptile Repo.

24:10.699 --> 24:13.368
[Kat] <i>You were playing video games</i>
<i>with Dion in the middle of the day?</i>

24:13.452 --> 24:16.037
How old are you? Twelve?
Don't you got a job?

24:16.121 --> 24:18.540
[Pat] <i>Yes, I have a very creative job,</i>
<i>and I make my own hours,</i>

24:18.623 --> 24:19.749
<i>and that's not the point.</i>

24:19.833 --> 24:22.502
The point is Mark made me promise
to look out for Dion,

24:22.586 --> 24:24.296
so when Dion calls and says he's bored

24:24.379 --> 24:27.215
because he's waiting for his mom
who's trying to get a job, I try to help.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.925
<i>So, she didn't get the job?</i>

24:29.009 --> 24:31.136
It was like she was trying
to sabotage herself.

24:31.219 --> 24:32.762
<i>-Do you want me to talk to her?</i>
-[woman] Doctor.

24:32.846 --> 24:34.973
No. Please, don't do anything.

24:35.223 --> 24:36.850
Do not tell her that I called you.

24:37.309 --> 24:40.854
Okay, I won't. But look,
I understand why you're worried.

24:40.937 --> 24:44.483
She's trying to handle everything
by herself, and... [inhales]

24:44.566 --> 24:46.735
[sighs] I mean, she's even trying
to be Dion's Yoda.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.320
-What?
-[Pat] <i>I know, right?</i>

24:48.487 --> 24:51.406
Anyway, she's just more stressed
than normal.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.493
Well, maybe you can check in on her.

24:54.576 --> 24:56.912
Just do that thing
where you show up where you're not wanted.

24:57.412 --> 24:58.288
Excuse me?

24:58.371 --> 25:01.291
You know, when you show up not invited,
not expected.

25:01.374 --> 25:03.001
Mm-hmm. Okay, just stop talking.

25:03.084 --> 25:05.462
Yes, I will drop by and say hello.

25:05.545 --> 25:07.380
Just be cool.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.257
Um... I'm Mr. Cool.

25:09.841 --> 25:11.259
-Right.
-Oh, and Kat, hey.

25:11.343 --> 25:15.013
Maybe you could work on your, uh,
people skills just a little teensy bit.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.057
-Bye, Pat.
-[chuckling] Bye, Kat.

25:17.974 --> 25:18.892
[disconnects call]

25:22.562 --> 25:24.773
[Dion] Babyproofing? I'm not a baby.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.107
[whirring]

25:26.816 --> 25:29.277
Well, we don't want things
flying around the room.

25:29.569 --> 25:31.404
Whoa, cool!

25:32.113 --> 25:33.156
Can I have these?

25:34.908 --> 25:36.117
You can play with them.

25:36.868 --> 25:39.412
I am Goggleman!

25:40.997 --> 25:45.293
Goggleman away!

25:47.629 --> 25:49.798
I am Broomface.

25:52.008 --> 25:53.593
I am Plunger!

25:53.677 --> 25:55.053
[grunting]

25:57.222 --> 25:58.682
You took away my power!

25:59.266 --> 26:01.184
-Oh, no, it's wet!
-[water dripping]

26:02.435 --> 26:03.895
[whirring]

26:03.979 --> 26:04.938
Hammerhead!

26:05.021 --> 26:06.523
Hammer, hammer, hammer, h--

26:06.606 --> 26:08.942
Stop. Please, will you just
let me finish doing this

26:09.025 --> 26:10.402
so the furniture doesn't fly
around the house?

26:10.485 --> 26:12.571
I need a costume
so I can go back to school.

26:12.654 --> 26:13.863
Like Peter Parker.

26:14.030 --> 26:15.490
[banging on door]

26:15.740 --> 26:17.492
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Come here.

26:18.076 --> 26:20.537
Go to your room
and do not make things fly.

26:20.620 --> 26:21.871
-Watch out, bad guy.
-Thank you.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.164
Here comes Hammerhead.

26:23.582 --> 26:24.583
[objects clattering]

26:25.000 --> 26:27.002
-[banging]
-[Nicole sighs]

26:29.629 --> 26:32.382
You're not allowed to drill into the wall.

26:32.757 --> 26:34.009
It was the TV.

26:34.301 --> 26:37.387
-Sounded pretty real to me.
-George! Why are you hassling her?

26:37.470 --> 26:39.806
-You still haven't fixed my sink.
-I'll get to it.

26:39.889 --> 26:42.267
-Don't give me "get to it." Get to it.
-Soon as I'm done here.

26:42.350 --> 26:44.436
[boy] According
to the renter's agreement,

26:44.519 --> 26:47.522
the super cannot inspect an apartment
without 48 hours notice.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.440
Oh.

26:50.609 --> 26:51.443
All right.

26:51.985 --> 26:52.819
All right.

26:52.902 --> 26:55.155
[woman] Go on. Malik'll show you.
Malik, watch him.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.157
And do something
about these ants around here.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.117
Thank you.

26:59.492 --> 27:01.453
[exhales] We watch out
for each other. I'm Tessa.

27:01.536 --> 27:04.497
Nicole. Uh, we're just settling in.
I should have said hi by now.

27:04.581 --> 27:07.417
You got coffee?
I hate being in my apartment with George.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.836
That man does not understand
the volume of his voice.

27:09.919 --> 27:10.754
Can I come in?

27:11.004 --> 27:11.921
Oh, uh...

27:12.005 --> 27:14.090
-I'm gonna come in. It's okay.
-Okay, okay. Um...

27:14.174 --> 27:17.052
Dion, I have company over.
Stay in your room.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.470
Okay.

27:24.768 --> 27:27.812
[makes shooting, explosion sounds]

27:36.404 --> 27:37.697
You babyproofing?

27:38.323 --> 27:39.991
-How old's your son?
-Um...

27:40.075 --> 27:41.034
Seven.

27:41.701 --> 27:42.535
Almost eight.

27:42.619 --> 27:45.997
But you know how boys are. They're always
finding new ways to hurt themselves.

27:46.081 --> 27:49.084
[scoffs] You're telling me. The other day,
my son Malik and his friend

27:49.167 --> 27:51.795
were playing a game where they just
threw each other down the stairs.

27:51.878 --> 27:52.712
[laughs]

27:52.796 --> 27:54.714
-[cell phone rings and vibrates]
-Oh, um...

27:55.131 --> 27:55.965
Excuse me.

27:56.758 --> 27:59.678
-Hey, Pat.
-So, I found your Charlotte Tuck.

27:59.761 --> 28:01.554
I thought I told you
I was gonna do that.

28:01.638 --> 28:05.266
I know, but, uh, I found a low-res pic
in an article on Mark's death,

28:05.350 --> 28:06.309
and, um, it was...

28:06.393 --> 28:09.437
it was pretty crappy,
but I have a friend who works in DARPA,

28:09.771 --> 28:12.982
and he's developing
a next-level facial recognition algorithm,

28:13.066 --> 28:15.026
<i>and I talked him into letting me</i>
<i>try it out.</i>

28:15.110 --> 28:16.861
-Why?
-Why? [chuckles]

28:17.195 --> 28:18.863
Um, she seems pretty normal.

28:18.947 --> 28:19.823
Divorced.

28:19.906 --> 28:20.824
Uh...

28:20.907 --> 28:23.493
learned how to make stained glass
for some reason.

28:23.910 --> 28:25.036
And then, the trail...

28:25.704 --> 28:26.621
goes cold.

28:26.996 --> 28:27.831
What do you mean?

28:27.914 --> 28:32.877
<i>Well, there's nothing anywhere</i>
<i>on Charlotte Tuck after August 12th, 2017.</i>

28:33.211 --> 28:34.254
That's the day that--

28:34.337 --> 28:36.005
Mark died. I know. Um...

28:36.506 --> 28:37.757
It looks like she just...

28:38.299 --> 28:39.342
went off the grid.

28:40.343 --> 28:41.594
Or worse.

28:41.678 --> 28:42.554
Wow, so...

28:43.430 --> 28:44.931
-that's it.
-[Pat] <i>Well, let's not...</i>

28:45.014 --> 28:47.142
Let's not give up hope yet. Um...

28:47.225 --> 28:50.854
You still have that phone number, right?
If you want to give that to me, I could--

28:50.937 --> 28:51.980
-Uh, no.
-[Pat] <i>Okay.</i>

28:52.230 --> 28:53.064
<i>Um...</i>

28:53.565 --> 28:55.275
Well, I'm on my way home,

28:55.900 --> 28:57.819
<i>so I could come by</i>
<i>and we can talk about it.</i>

28:57.902 --> 28:59.362
No, I've got company.

28:59.654 --> 29:01.906
Yeah, oh, cool. All right. Uh, no problem.

29:01.990 --> 29:03.241
[Nicole] <i>Um, but, uh...</i>

29:03.783 --> 29:05.243
thank you for... for doing that.

29:05.994 --> 29:06.828
Of course.

29:07.328 --> 29:08.580
-[Nicole] <i>Bye.</i>
-Yeah, bye.

29:11.124 --> 29:12.459
Would you like cream or sugar?

29:12.542 --> 29:13.960
I like it creamy and sweet.

29:15.837 --> 29:16.796
Man troubles?

29:16.880 --> 29:18.923
Ugh... no.

29:19.007 --> 29:20.759
That was just Pat,

29:21.217 --> 29:23.094
who is a man, technically.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.971
He's Dion's godfather.

29:25.346 --> 29:27.182
Sounds like he's up in your business.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.142
[Nicole] Yeah.

29:29.225 --> 29:31.019
And how your business feel about that?

29:31.102 --> 29:32.061
Mm, mm-mmm.

29:32.145 --> 29:34.022
I've been through
too many of his girlfriends

29:34.105 --> 29:36.274
-to be interested in any of that.
-Well, what's his deal?

29:36.357 --> 29:37.484
[banging]

29:37.567 --> 29:39.986
Girl, what, you running
from the cops or something?

29:40.069 --> 29:41.070
[chuckles nervously]

29:41.529 --> 29:42.989
[suspenseful music plays]

29:49.829 --> 29:51.289
[banging]

29:55.835 --> 29:57.712
I brought Dion's homework.

29:58.838 --> 30:01.299
Thank you.
I will make sure that he gets it.

30:01.382 --> 30:04.385
My dad's parking the van.
He'll be up when he's done.

30:06.012 --> 30:08.890
-Okay, then come on in.
-[Esperanza] Thanks.

30:11.893 --> 30:14.604
-Uh, it's Esperanza, right?
-Yep.

30:15.104 --> 30:17.690
-Awesome. Esperanza, this is Tessa.
-Hi.

30:17.774 --> 30:20.735
Hi, I'm Dion's best friend,
but he doesn't know it yet.

30:21.486 --> 30:22.320
Okay.

30:28.785 --> 30:30.537
I am the Mind Mover.

30:30.620 --> 30:33.456
I move things with my mind.

30:44.092 --> 30:45.093
[yells]

30:45.343 --> 30:46.553
[clattering]

30:47.470 --> 30:48.888
Hey, what's going on in there?

30:50.223 --> 30:51.099
Nothing!

30:51.182 --> 30:52.308
[Nicole] Are you okay?

30:52.392 --> 30:53.226
Yeah, why?

30:53.309 --> 30:54.727
Esperanza's here to see you.

30:55.520 --> 30:57.230
-Dion?
-[Dion] Dion's not here.

30:57.647 --> 30:59.858
I am Mind Mover!

30:59.941 --> 31:03.444
Would you mind moving on back
so I can roll in here?

31:06.531 --> 31:08.324
I have some thoughts on your fort.

31:08.992 --> 31:10.869
[sighs] It is a lair.

31:11.119 --> 31:12.328
What's wrong with it?

31:12.412 --> 31:14.789
For starters,
it's not wheelchair accessible.

31:15.206 --> 31:16.583
I didn't know you were coming over.

31:16.666 --> 31:17.959
Well, I'm here.

31:18.585 --> 31:19.544
[sighs]

31:20.753 --> 31:22.797
[grunting]

31:23.965 --> 31:26.676
-So this Pat guy's not an option?
-You know... [exhales]

31:26.759 --> 31:28.052
He comes on too strong.

31:28.136 --> 31:31.389
There was one girl that actually really
liked him. Even she couldn't handle it.

31:31.472 --> 31:32.849
You know, he's just got no chill.

31:32.932 --> 31:34.350
Well, he needs to calm down.

31:34.434 --> 31:36.060
Ugh, he needs to listen.

31:36.686 --> 31:40.064
I specifically told him
not to get involved in a certain thing,

31:40.148 --> 31:42.525
and then he just... couldn't help himself.

31:42.609 --> 31:43.776
Well, you know saviors.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.236
Gotta be saving.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.154
[Nicole] Mmm.

31:47.071 --> 31:50.909
Okay, lair is up to code.
You won't get fined by the city.

31:50.992 --> 31:53.161
Great. Now I need a new costume.

31:53.244 --> 31:54.078
Why?

31:54.454 --> 31:55.413
'Cause you saw it.

31:55.496 --> 31:57.874
[Nicole] Esperanza, your father's
waiting for you downstairs.

31:57.957 --> 31:58.791
[Esperanza] Okay.

32:02.045 --> 32:03.588
Don't change your costume.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.089
It's too good.

32:05.173 --> 32:08.134
Besides, I'm the only one who's seen it,
and I'm invisible.

32:11.888 --> 32:13.723
[inhales, exhales deeply]

32:14.057 --> 32:16.059
I am Mind Mover.

32:16.142 --> 32:17.352
-Bye.
-Bye.

32:17.435 --> 32:18.269
[Nicole laughs]

32:18.353 --> 32:19.979
Thanks again
for dropping off the homework.

32:20.063 --> 32:21.481
[Esperanza's dad] Sure, no problem.

32:21.856 --> 32:23.024
[grunting]

32:24.943 --> 32:27.236
Come on, bad guys.
Mind Mover's ready for you.

32:32.325 --> 32:33.159
[car door closes]

32:33.242 --> 32:34.077
[Pat] Nicole.

32:34.410 --> 32:37.205
Hi. It's all right. Don't worry.
I'm just dropping this off.

32:37.288 --> 32:38.539
I brought some, uh...

32:38.915 --> 32:40.500
some Chinese food for you and Dion.

32:40.583 --> 32:43.294
You sounded a little tired
when you were on the phone,

32:43.378 --> 32:45.713
so I thought I'd save you the trouble
of making dinner.

32:46.464 --> 32:48.675
-[clears throat]
-You didn't have to do that.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.093
I know.

32:50.176 --> 32:53.137
Um, and I also brought you dessert.

32:54.263 --> 32:55.181
So...

32:55.473 --> 32:58.518
And I thought maybe we could talk about
Charlotte Tuck for just one more minute.

33:03.481 --> 33:05.566
Yeah, keep driving, bad guys.

33:07.443 --> 33:09.696
-What are you doing, Pat?
-About the...

33:09.988 --> 33:11.155
The full-court press.

33:11.239 --> 33:13.157
I mean, I ask you one question
about the woman,

33:13.241 --> 33:14.701
and you've become obsessed.

33:15.201 --> 33:16.035
[scoffs]

33:16.285 --> 33:17.328
I'm interested.

33:17.870 --> 33:20.665
It's interesting
that there's a mystery to be solved.

33:21.207 --> 33:23.960
This isn't a game, okay?
We're talking about my husband.

33:24.043 --> 33:27.422
Yeah, and my friend,
who was lying to both of us.

33:27.755 --> 33:29.549
And that's not the Mark I knew,

33:29.632 --> 33:31.926
so I want to understand what happened,

33:32.010 --> 33:35.805
and, yeah, I want to talk
to the last person to see him alive.

33:38.725 --> 33:39.642
[inhales]

33:39.726 --> 33:40.601
[sighs]

33:41.352 --> 33:42.895
Why don't you want me around?

33:42.979 --> 33:46.232
I mean, I know we... we had a rocky start
when you and Mark first got married.

33:46.315 --> 33:48.317
You called me a train wreck.

33:48.943 --> 33:52.572
[scoffs] Why did he... tell you that?
I didn't say it like that.

33:52.655 --> 33:54.323
-Okay, then, how did you say it?
-It was...

33:54.741 --> 33:57.577
It was a more supportive way
of saying train wreck.

33:57.660 --> 33:58.494
Ah.

33:58.703 --> 33:59.537
-Look, okay.
-Right.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.497
You took my best friend.
You came out of nowhere.

34:01.581 --> 34:03.207
You made him ridiculously happy.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.835
And I couldn't keep a girlfriend
to save my life.

34:07.170 --> 34:08.004
And...

34:08.963 --> 34:10.465
-I was a jerk.
-Yeah, you were a jerk.

34:10.548 --> 34:12.050
I was. I totally was.

34:12.133 --> 34:13.551
But... now I'm not.

34:14.218 --> 34:16.387
And now I just... wanna help.

34:18.222 --> 34:19.057
I...

34:19.640 --> 34:21.267
[inhales, sighs]

34:22.935 --> 34:24.979
[voice wavers]
I keep wondering if there was...

34:25.980 --> 34:28.232
something that I could have done to...

34:30.318 --> 34:33.029
you know, change things, and...

34:33.654 --> 34:36.282
if he'd talked to me, maybe.

34:36.657 --> 34:38.993
But Mark had that thing where...

34:39.077 --> 34:41.287
A man handles his problems on his own.

34:41.370 --> 34:42.455
Yes, exactly.

34:43.039 --> 34:45.458
And I know he thought
he was being strong, but...

34:45.917 --> 34:47.794
it just made me feel shut out.

34:49.087 --> 34:51.547
But anyway, uh, I'm gonna go.

34:52.590 --> 34:53.925
This is for you,

34:54.008 --> 34:55.218
or it's for the trash.

34:55.301 --> 34:56.302
Good. Thank you.

34:56.719 --> 34:57.553
Um...

34:57.887 --> 35:01.307
And look, if you ever decide
that you want any help,

35:01.766 --> 35:04.310
especially if it involves garlic beef...

35:04.727 --> 35:07.355
uh, just... call me.

35:07.814 --> 35:10.149
You'd be doing me a favor, on many levels.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.026
So...

35:15.404 --> 35:16.697
Hey, Pat. Wait.

35:21.285 --> 35:22.203
Yeah, what is it?

35:29.043 --> 35:29.877
[child] My bunny!

35:32.463 --> 35:34.507
-The doll! She dropped her doll.
-[banging]

35:39.887 --> 35:40.721
Move...

35:41.139 --> 35:41.973
now!

35:42.056 --> 35:42.932
Thank you.

35:44.517 --> 35:45.726
Oh, yeah, sure.

35:46.102 --> 35:46.936
Move...

35:47.228 --> 35:48.062
now!

35:48.479 --> 35:49.313
Move...

35:49.647 --> 35:50.773
now!

35:58.906 --> 36:01.033
Mister, I've got your doll.

36:01.450 --> 36:02.577
Dion!

36:02.660 --> 36:03.494
[Dion screams]

36:05.079 --> 36:05.913
[Nicole gasps]

36:05.997 --> 36:06.956
Oh!

36:07.039 --> 36:07.874
Oh, my God.

36:07.957 --> 36:09.292
[sobbing]

36:10.084 --> 36:11.043
Oh, my God.

36:11.377 --> 36:12.837
You could have been killed!

36:13.087 --> 36:14.046
[sobbing]

36:15.298 --> 36:16.757
[dramatic music plays]
