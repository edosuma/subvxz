00:01.084 --> 00:03.678
Your argument is lacking
in all scientific merit.

00:03.852 --> 00:05.445
And it is well-established...

00:05.622 --> 00:08.955
...Superman cleans his uniform
by flying into Earth's yellow sun...

00:09.125 --> 00:11.218
...which incinerates
any contaminant matter...

00:11.394 --> 00:15.693
...and leaves the invulnerable Kryptonian
fabric unharmed and daisy fresh.

00:17.000 --> 00:18.991
What if he gets something
Kryptonian on it?

00:19.169 --> 00:23.105
-Like what?
-I don't know. Kryptonian mustard.

00:23.273 --> 00:26.333
I think we can assume all Kryptonian
condiments were destroyed...

00:26.509 --> 00:29.103
...when the planet Krypton exploded.

00:29.279 --> 00:31.213
Or it turned into mustard Kryptonite.

00:31.381 --> 00:35.545
The only way to destroy a rogue
Kryptonian hot dog threatening Earth.

00:36.486 --> 00:39.046
Raj, please, let's stay serious here.

00:39.222 --> 00:42.783
Superman's body is Kryptonian,
therefore his sweat is Kryptonian.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.450
Yeah, what about Kryptonian pit stains?

00:45.929 --> 00:47.692
Superman doesn't sweat on Earth.

00:47.864 --> 00:50.560
Okay. He's invited for dinner
in the bottle city of Kandor.

00:50.734 --> 00:54.170
He miniaturizes himself, enters the city,
where he loses his super-powers.

00:54.337 --> 00:57.431
Before dinner, his host says,
"Who's up for Kryptonian tetherball?"

00:57.607 --> 01:00.804
Superman works up a sweat, comes back
to Earth, his uniform now stained...

01:00.977 --> 01:03.537
...with indestructible
Kryptonian perspiration.

01:06.649 --> 01:08.241
Booyah.

01:10.320 --> 01:13.380
Superman would have taken his uniform
to a Kandorian dry-cleaner...

01:13.556 --> 01:15.683
...before he left the bottle.

01:16.359 --> 01:20.625
Kandorian dry-cl--? I give up. You can't have
a rational argument with this man.

01:22.265 --> 01:25.496
Hey, isn't that the guy who won
the MacArthur genius grant last year?

01:26.302 --> 01:28.429
No, not all at once.

01:28.605 --> 01:31.733
-Then how?
-Leonard.

01:33.076 --> 01:34.907
Now Raj.

01:36.412 --> 01:38.346
Now Sheldon.

01:40.016 --> 01:42.849
-I didn't get a good look. Can I go again?
-No.

01:43.019 --> 01:46.011
-That's David Underhill. So what?
-So what?

01:46.189 --> 01:49.716
His observation of high-energy positrons
has provided the first evidence...

01:49.893 --> 01:51.952
...for the existence
of galactic dark matter.

01:52.128 --> 01:55.564
I have two words for you.
The first is "big," the other's "whoop."

01:56.032 --> 01:59.934
It is a big whoop. Made almost all the work
you've done completely useless.

02:00.103 --> 02:02.003
-Did not.
-Did too.

02:02.172 --> 02:04.538
Okay, maybe some of it. But....

02:04.707 --> 02:07.039
The guy was just in the right place
at the right time...

02:07.210 --> 02:09.906
...with the right paradigm-shifting
reinterpretation of the universe.

02:10.079 --> 02:11.944
He got lucky.

02:12.382 --> 02:13.542
In more ways than one.

02:14.184 --> 02:16.448
He's a very handsome man.

02:17.053 --> 02:19.385
Doesn't do anything for me.
If I was gonna go that way...

02:19.556 --> 02:22.548
...l'm more of a Zac Efron kind of guy.

02:24.494 --> 02:26.928
Oh, yeah.
Like you have a shot with Zac Efron.

Dr. Gablehauser said
if I wanted to set up something in the lab...

02:40.443 --> 02:42.411

he's a black-diamond skier...

he plays in a rock band.

-No.

Hey, Sheldon. Are you and Leonard
putting up a Christmas tree?

05:24.440 --> 05:28.501
No, because we don't celebrate
the ancient pagan festival of Saturnalia.

05:29.979 --> 05:31.105
Saturnalia?

05:31.280 --> 05:36.343
Gather around, kids. It's time for Sheldon's
beloved Christmas special.

05:37.954 --> 05:41.754
In the pre-Christian era, as the winter
solstice approached and the plants died...

05:41.924 --> 05:45.792
...pagans brought evergreen boughs in their
homes as an act of sympathetic magic...

05:45.962 --> 05:49.193
...intended to guard the life essences
of the plants until spring.

05:49.365 --> 05:51.799
This custom was appropriated
by northern Europeans...

05:51.968 --> 05:54.960
...and, eventually, it becomes
the so-called Christmas tree.

05:56.706 --> 06:00.699

is what boredom is all about.

06:17.326 --> 06:18.918
I know you think you're being generous...

06:19.095 --> 06:21.689

is reciprocity.

you've given me an obligation.

It's okay.
You don't have to get me anything.

06:38.014 --> 06:42.007
Of course I do. The essence of the custom
is that I now have to go and purchase...

06:42.185 --> 06:45.916
...a gift of commensurate value and
representing the same level of friendship...

06:46.089 --> 06:49.081

you've given me.

-Maybe I heard you wrong.

12:35.204 --> 12:37.604
A lot of words sound like "yoga."

12:38.474 --> 12:42.137
This is an amazing woman, Leonard.
She has a curious and agile mind.

12:42.311 --> 12:45.212
Not to mention being curious and agile
in other respects.

12:45.614 --> 12:47.206
Shut up.

12:47.383 --> 12:49.715
Yes, please, shut up.

12:51.086 --> 12:54.817
So, um, Dave, don't you think
you and I should get back to the lab?

12:54.990 --> 12:58.289
You know, that dark matter
isn't gonna detect itself.

13:01.363 --> 13:05.299
I was thinking about taking the afternoon
off so I could experiment with Penny.

13:05.801 --> 13:08.133
-Really? We're gonna do an experiment?
DAVID: Uh-huh.

13:08.304 --> 13:12.638
We're gonna explore the effects of tequila
shots on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman.

13:12.808 --> 13:15.971
That's not an experiment.
You saw what happened last night.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.010
DAVID: You ready to go?
-Yeah.

13:19.181 --> 13:21.547
-Oh, can I drive the motorcycle?
-Yeah, why not?

13:21.717 --> 13:23.480
You can't do any worse than Leonard.

13:23.652 --> 13:26.382
-Oh, my God.
-No, that's good. That's funny.

13:28.991 --> 13:32.392
By the way, my leg is killing me.
Thanks for asking.

13:54.817 --> 13:59.379
Mm. Great news, Leonard.
I've solved my Penny gift dilemma.

13:59.555 --> 14:01.216
Yippee.

14:01.423 --> 14:04.654
You see, the danger was that
I might under- or over-reciprocate...

14:04.827 --> 14:06.761
...but I have devised a foolproof plan.

14:07.329 --> 14:12.631
I will open her gift to me first and then
excuse myself, feigning digestive distress.

14:12.801 --> 14:15.861
Then I'll look up the price
of her gift online...

14:16.038 --> 14:19.633
...choose the basket closest to that value,
give it to her...

14:19.808 --> 14:22.936
...and then I'll return the others
for a full refund.

14:24.213 --> 14:25.874
Brilliant.

14:26.048 --> 14:28.016
It is, isn't it?

14:28.584 --> 14:30.449
Is it okay if I hide them in your room?

14:30.619 --> 14:33.611
The smell makes me nauseated.

14:34.223 --> 14:37.317
-Do whatever you want.
-Thank you. That's very gracious.

14:39.461 --> 14:41.122
Gentlemen?

14:44.466 --> 14:46.957
HOWARD: Why couldn't you have
just done what Leonard did...

14:47.136 --> 14:49.627
...and get Penny a new boyfriend?

14:53.008 --> 14:56.739
My leg is killing me. Thanks for asking.

15:04.186 --> 15:05.847
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

15:06.655 --> 15:09.818
Okay, I have just one question for you.

15:09.992 --> 15:12.426
While I am perfectly happy
with the way things are...

15:12.595 --> 15:16.326
...you said that you didn't wanna go out
with me because I was too smart for you.

15:16.498 --> 15:20.662
Well, news flash, lady:
David Underhill is 10 times smarter than me.

15:20.836 --> 15:25.273
You'd have to drive a railroad spike into
his brain for me to beat him at checkers.

15:26.008 --> 15:30.945
Next to him, I'm one of those sign-language
gorillas who knows how to ask for grapes.

15:31.680 --> 15:34.274
So my question is...

15:34.450 --> 15:36.577
...what's up with that?

15:38.487 --> 15:40.455
Why are you yelling at me?

15:40.889 --> 15:44.791
Sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Never mind, we're cool.

15:45.361 --> 15:47.955
Dave is not smarter than you.
He's an idiot.

15:49.098 --> 15:51.464
Really? Why would you say that?

15:51.634 --> 15:55.536
Because a smart guy takes the nude photos
of his wife off his cell phone...

15:55.704 --> 15:59.265
...before he tries to take nude photos
of his girlfriend.

16:00.909 --> 16:02.570
He tried to take nude photos of you?

16:03.545 --> 16:06.480
That's what you took from that?

16:08.450 --> 16:10.475
The guy is married.

16:10.653 --> 16:12.348
Oh, yeah.

16:12.521 --> 16:15.581
I'm sor-- Oh, that's terrible.

16:15.758 --> 16:19.819
And you. If you are so okay with the way
things are between us, why are you jealous?

16:20.129 --> 16:21.153
Well, that--

16:22.731 --> 16:26.497
The important thing is
he's married and that's terrible.

16:28.537 --> 16:31.005
Nice save, genius.

16:31.740 --> 16:34.641
-Eggnog?
-Lactose.

16:35.844 --> 16:39.678
It's just rum. It stopped being eggnog,
like, a half an hour ago.

16:44.653 --> 16:46.348
Smooth.

16:47.690 --> 16:50.056
Smoother than you.

16:50.859 --> 16:53.885
Come on, it's Christmas.
Just give me this one.

16:55.130 --> 16:56.757
Okay.

16:57.199 --> 16:58.962
Merry Christmas.

17:03.972 --> 17:07.203
By the way, my leg is killing me.
Thanks for asking.

17:12.513 --> 17:14.175
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

17:15.951 --> 17:17.542
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

17:17.720 --> 17:20.848
-How's your leg?
-Very good. Thanks for asking. Come on in.

17:21.924 --> 17:25.758
Oh, good, Penny,
you're here to exchange gifts.

17:29.164 --> 17:33.157
You'll be pleased to know
I'm prepared for whatever you have to offer.

17:33.869 --> 17:35.268
Okay. Here.

17:39.007 --> 17:42.670
I should note,
I'm having some digestive distress...

17:44.613 --> 17:48.947
...so if I excuse myself abruptly,
don't be alarmed.

17:56.258 --> 17:59.785
Oh, a napkin.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.695
Turn it over.

18:09.438 --> 18:14.034
"To Sheldon. Live long and prosper.

18:14.810 --> 18:17.438
Leonard Nimoy."

18:20.048 --> 18:24.508
Yeah, he came into the restaurant. Sorry the
napkin's dirty. He wiped his mouth with it.

18:29.258 --> 18:33.718
I possess the DNA of Leonard Nimoy?

18:36.632 --> 18:38.259
Well....

18:41.503 --> 18:44.301
Yeah, yeah, I guess.
But look, he signed it.

18:44.473 --> 18:47.237
Do you realize what this means?

18:49.311 --> 18:54.510
All I need is a healthy ovum
and I can grow my own Leonard Nimoy.

18:58.620 --> 19:02.579
Okay, all I'm giving you is the napkin,
Sheldon.

19:04.960 --> 19:06.757
Be right back.

19:09.264 --> 19:11.323
-Here, open it.
-Oh.

19:13.802 --> 19:15.133
Oh.

19:15.304 --> 19:18.603
A gift certificate for motorcycle lessons.

19:20.809 --> 19:23.039
-Very thoughtful.
-Yeah, and I checked.

19:23.212 --> 19:27.672
Not letting the bike fall on you
while standing still is lesson one.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.908
Oh, then I think you'll appreciate
what I got you.

You know,
because you're so into science.

19:58.513 --> 20:00.981
Sheldon, what did you do?

20:01.617 --> 20:03.141
I know.

It's not enough, is it?

Here.
