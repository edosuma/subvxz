07:27.822 --> 07:30.075
- Hey, how you doing?

07:27.822 --> 07:30.075
- Hi, "Jive All Night Julie."

07:30.117 --> 07:31.576
Yeah, that's right.

07:31.618 --> 07:33.120
Have a seat. We're gonna go

07:31.618 --> 07:33.120
in one second.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.537
- Okay.

07:33.161 --> 07:34.537
- Alright.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.748
- Alright.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.748
- Alright, we're back.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.127
And with me is Jesse Katsopolis

07:36.790 --> 07:40.127
of "Jesse and The Rippers."

07:40.168 --> 07:41.669
Thanks for stopping by.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.669
Oh, it's my pleasure.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.422
Thanks for having me.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.422
This is-this is really cool.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.840
I mean, I-I love it. I love,

07:43.463 --> 07:45.840
I love the radio, you know.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.426
Especially 95.6.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.677
♪ Rock radio

07:47.467 --> 07:49.677
Ah-ha ♪♪

07:49.719 --> 07:51.638
[laughs]

07:51.679 --> 07:54.015
Oh, yeah, I see you brought

07:51.679 --> 07:54.015
your fan club with you.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.434
- Oh, yeah. That's my pal Joey.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.434
- 'Hmm.'

07:55.475 --> 07:57.185
- He-he's really a funny guy.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.185
- Oh, yeah.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.479
Let's bring him on in.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.189
(Jesse)

07:59.520 --> 08:01.189
'Oh, come on, Joey.

07:59.520 --> 08:01.189
She won't bite.'

08:04.609 --> 08:05.777
- Hi.

08:04.609 --> 08:05.777
- Hey, how you doing?

08:05.819 --> 08:08.571
Have a seat.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.571
Welcome to KFLH.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.782
Hello, San Francisco.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.242
Joey.

08:12.284 --> 08:13.952
That was good.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.496
Hey, Joey plays, um, Ranger Joe

08:13.994 --> 08:16.496
on the "Ranger Joe Show."

08:16.537 --> 08:18.039
You may have seen.

08:16.537 --> 08:18.039
It's on the afternoons.

08:18.081 --> 08:20.625
Sorry. I'm usually watching

08:18.081 --> 08:20.625
"Joanie Loves Chachi."

08:20.667 --> 08:22.252
So, anyway, Jesse,

08:20.667 --> 08:22.252
why don't you tell us

08:22.294 --> 08:23.586
about the "Feed

08:22.294 --> 08:23.586
The Hungry Benefit"

08:23.628 --> 08:24.963
at the Civic Center,

08:23.628 --> 08:24.963
this Saturday.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.631
Oh, yeah. It-it's really

08:25.005 --> 08:26.631
a great cause.

08:26.673 --> 08:28.758
It's uh, me and the Rippers

08:26.673 --> 08:28.758
and a bunch of great bands.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.093
So, come down.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.093
It starts at 8 o'clock.

08:30.135 --> 08:31.678
Great, you know, I heard

08:30.135 --> 08:31.678
you and the Rippers

08:31.719 --> 08:34.139
put on a really good show.

08:31.719 --> 08:34.139
Is that true Joey?

08:34.181 --> 08:36.308
Uh, sure, as long as

08:34.181 --> 08:36.308
it doesn't mess up his hair.

08:36.350 --> 08:37.809
[laughs]

08:38.977 --> 08:40.437
[laughs]

08:41.813 --> 08:42.939
Thanks, Joey.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.399
I gotta tell

08:42.981 --> 08:44.399
all you folks that

08:44.441 --> 08:46.651
their Jesse does have

08:44.441 --> 08:46.651
a great head of hair.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.446
Oh, well, thanks very much.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.446
I combed it once in fifth grade.

08:49.488 --> 08:51.698
And it's been

08:49.488 --> 08:51.698
perfect ever since.

08:51.739 --> 08:53.574
Yes, nature's been kind.

08:53.616 --> 08:54.742
[chuckles]

08:53.616 --> 08:54.742
Nature?

08:54.784 --> 08:56.453
Hey, this guy uses

08:54.784 --> 08:56.453
so much hair spray

08:56.495 --> 08:59.164
there's a giant hole in

08:56.495 --> 08:59.164
the ozone right above his head.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.666
[laughs]

09:06.963 --> 09:10.758
Uh, yeah, well,

09:06.963 --> 09:10.758
I-I-I do use a tad hair spray

09:10.800 --> 09:12.802
but let me tell you something,

09:10.800 --> 09:12.802
it is environmentally safe.

09:12.844 --> 09:15.389
- 'Oh, good.'

09:12.844 --> 09:15.389
- Safe and strong.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.724
Once during a tornado,

09:15.430 --> 09:17.724
I used it to spray down

09:17.765 --> 09:19.226
the patio umbrella.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.311
[laughs]

09:22.854 --> 09:25.982
So, Jesse, who are

09:22.854 --> 09:25.982
your musical influences?

09:26.024 --> 09:27.234
Uh, well, that's

09:26.024 --> 09:27.234
a good question.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.651
I'd have to say that, uh

09:28.693 --> 09:30.862
Elvis Presley did

09:28.693 --> 09:30.862
influenced me a little bit.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.198
A bit? Come on, admit it.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.198
You're obsessed.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.616
You spent more time

09:33.240 --> 09:35.616
voting for the Elvis stamp

09:35.658 --> 09:37.327
than you did

09:35.658 --> 09:37.327
the last three Presidents.

09:37.369 --> 09:39.454
[laughing]

09:41.415 --> 09:42.957
I'm not obsessed.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.210
Tell them about

09:42.999 --> 09:45.210
your Elvis underwear.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.841
Alright, I just have

09:49.214 --> 09:51.841
one pair that says

09:51.883 --> 09:54.677
"Love me tender" on the back.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.346
[laughing]

09:56.388 --> 09:59.140
Alright, well, we've been

09:56.388 --> 09:59.140
talking to Jesse Katsopolis

09:59.182 --> 10:02.227
and Joey Gladstone,

09:59.182 --> 10:02.227
and we'll be right back.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.645
Great spot, you guys.

10:04.687 --> 10:05.980
- Very funny.

10:04.687 --> 10:05.980
- Oh, yes.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.107
Hang in here a minute,

10:06.022 --> 10:07.107
would you?

10:07.148 --> 10:08.649
- Okay.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.649
- Yeah.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.695
[tapping]

10:12.737 --> 10:14.406
Man, that was a blast.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.825
[tapping]

10:22.830 --> 10:24.416
- What?

10:22.830 --> 10:24.416
- What do you mean "What?"

10:24.458 --> 10:25.708
You just made me

10:24.458 --> 10:25.708
look like an idiot

10:25.750 --> 10:27.043
in front of millions of people.

10:27.085 --> 10:30.797
Oh, come on, it was probably

10:27.085 --> 10:30.797
only thousands.

10:30.838 --> 10:33.007
I can't believe you,

10:30.838 --> 10:33.007
m-making cracks about my hair

10:33.049 --> 10:35.718
my underwear. You blew the one

10:33.049 --> 10:35.718
shot I had at this job.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.971
I don't believe this.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.971
Settle down, Mr. Cranky pants.

10:38.012 --> 10:39.347
I was just having

10:38.012 --> 10:39.347
a little bit of fun.

10:39.389 --> 10:41.516
It's like your hair's

10:39.389 --> 10:41.516
your whole life.

10:41.558 --> 10:43.017
At least, cartoons

10:41.558 --> 10:43.017
aren't my whole life.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.311
If you can call that a life.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.020
Alright, fine.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.020
Alright. That's it.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.147
- I'm out of here.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.147
- Alright. Bye.

10:47.188 --> 10:48.273
Bye, Bullwinkle brain.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.233
Bye, dippity-doo head.

10:50.275 --> 10:51.818
- Bullwinkle brain!

10:50.275 --> 10:51.818
- Dippity-doo head!

10:51.859 --> 10:53.361
- Bullwinkle brain!

10:51.859 --> 10:53.361
- Jesse.

10:53.403 --> 10:55.655
Bullwinkle...oh, hi,

10:53.403 --> 10:55.655
Jive all night.

10:55.696 --> 10:58.492
[laughs]

10:55.696 --> 10:58.492
You know what?

10:55.696 --> 10:58.492
Everybody loved that segment.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.285
The phone lines

10:58.533 --> 11:00.285
are going crazy.

11:00.327 --> 11:02.954
We've been looking for someone

11:00.327 --> 11:02.954
to fill in the afternoon slot.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.706
- Really? I didn't know that.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.706
- Um, so, are you interested?

11:05.748 --> 11:07.292
Yeah, this should be perfect,

11:05.748 --> 11:07.292
this should be great.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.876
You know, I'll program

11:07.334 --> 11:08.876
my own music

11:08.918 --> 11:10.295
maybe play some live stuff.

11:08.918 --> 11:10.295
I'll tell you something.

11:10.337 --> 11:12.547
Monday, I'm gonna be right

11:10.337 --> 11:12.547
here in this chair.

11:12.589 --> 11:15.800
Fine, as long as Joey

11:12.589 --> 11:15.800
is right next to you.

11:19.638 --> 11:21.680
[dramatic music]

11:25.143 --> 11:27.187
[instrumental music]

11:31.650 --> 11:32.651
[knocking]

11:32.691 --> 11:35.069
[door creaks]

11:35.111 --> 11:36.488
Joe-Joe.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.490
Joege. My man.

11:38.532 --> 11:40.200
How you doing, buddy?

11:40.241 --> 11:41.700
Uh, listen,

11:40.241 --> 11:41.700
I think it's time

11:41.742 --> 11:43.995
that, uh, how about maybe

11:41.742 --> 11:43.995
you and I sit down

11:44.037 --> 11:46.789
and have a nice talk,

11:44.037 --> 11:46.789
like mature adults.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.417
Uh, but first, I found this

11:46.831 --> 11:49.417
laying around.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.336
Ha, what do think

11:49.459 --> 11:51.336
of that, huh?

11:51.378 --> 11:54.339
Double fudge sundae,

11:51.378 --> 11:54.339
whipped cream

11:54.381 --> 11:56.132
fruit loops and see that

11:54.381 --> 11:56.132
little thing on top

11:56.174 --> 11:57.384
that small red thing?

11:57.425 --> 11:58.926
That's a cherry, pal.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.805
Yeah. Real cute, Jess.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.140
And I'm supposed

12:02.847 --> 12:04.140
to just forgive you

12:04.182 --> 12:05.308
for all the mean stuff you said

12:05.350 --> 12:07.227
just because you

12:05.350 --> 12:07.227
brought me ice cream?

12:07.268 --> 12:09.062
Well, in case you haven't

12:07.268 --> 12:09.062
noticed the height difference

12:09.103 --> 12:10.564
I'm not Michelle.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.442
Did you say fruit loops?

12:16.110 --> 12:18.488
Took out the yellow ones.

12:16.110 --> 12:18.488
I know you hate the yellow ones.

12:18.530 --> 12:20.657
Huh? Eh.

12:20.699 --> 12:22.033
- Huh?

12:20.699 --> 12:22.033
- Okay. You're forgiven.

12:22.075 --> 12:24.160
[chuckles]

12:22.075 --> 12:24.160
Alright! Pals again.

12:24.202 --> 12:27.038
- Pals.

12:24.202 --> 12:27.038
- Buddies again. Alright.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.375
Oh, you know what?

12:27.080 --> 12:30.375
This just came to mind.

12:30.417 --> 12:33.086
KFLH wants us to team up

12:30.417 --> 12:33.086
and do an afternoon radio show.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.588
And I told them yes.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.588
Thanks, pal.

12:34.629 --> 12:35.963
Aha!

12:36.005 --> 12:37.507
- Aha!

12:36.005 --> 12:37.507
- What?

12:37.549 --> 12:38.799
- Aha!

12:37.549 --> 12:38.799
- What? Why are we doing..

12:38.841 --> 12:41.844
What is this?

12:38.841 --> 12:41.844
Why are we doing this?

12:41.886 --> 12:43.555
You're just being nice to me

12:41.886 --> 12:43.555
because you need me now.

12:43.597 --> 12:45.932
Come on, Joey. This would be

12:43.597 --> 12:45.932
a great job for the both of us.

12:45.973 --> 12:47.559
There's no way I can

12:45.973 --> 12:47.559
work with someone

12:47.601 --> 12:49.686
who can't even take a joke.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.229
There's nothing funny

12:49.728 --> 12:51.229
about my hair.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.732
No but there is

12:51.271 --> 12:53.732
something darn funny

12:53.772 --> 12:57.360
about the big mousse stain

12:53.772 --> 12:57.360
you leave on the couch.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.153
You know what? I ain't doing

12:57.402 --> 12:59.153
the show with you.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.448
No that's where you're wrong.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.448
I ain't doing the show with you.

13:01.489 --> 13:04.242
- 'No, I'm not doing with you.'

13:01.489 --> 13:04.242
- Excuse me.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.160
Yes, Michelle.

13:06.202 --> 13:09.038
If you guys are arguing,

13:06.202 --> 13:09.038
I could help.

13:09.080 --> 13:10.665
I don't think so, Michelle.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.251
Don't worry.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.251
I'm a good helper.

13:13.293 --> 13:17.088
Now, you stand here

13:13.293 --> 13:17.088
and you stand here.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.840
When I count to three

13:19.882 --> 13:22.302
say you're sorry.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.344
One.

13:23.386 --> 13:24.554
Two.

13:24.596 --> 13:26.013
Three.

13:29.309 --> 13:32.853
Four, five, six.

13:32.895 --> 13:36.399
Okay. Skip the sorry.

13:32.895 --> 13:36.399
Just hug.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.741
Forget it, Michelle. I ain't

13:42.238 --> 13:44.741
hugging a bullwinkle brain.

13:44.783 --> 13:46.867

13:44.783 --> 13:46.867
- Bullwinkle brain.

13:46.909 --> 13:49.579

13:46.909 --> 13:49.579

13:49.621 --> 13:51.956

14:00.799 --> 14:02.801
'Steve, get away

14:00.799 --> 14:02.801
from the cupboard.'

14:02.841 --> 14:04.594
'We have to get there

14:02.841 --> 14:04.594
and study.'

14:04.636 --> 14:07.972
(Steve)

14:04.636 --> 14:07.972
'I just need little snack

14:04.636 --> 14:07.972

14:08.014 --> 14:10.891
'Alright. Come on.'

14:10.933 --> 14:13.894
Okay, I'm all set. Got all

14:33.665 --> 14:36.543
- I don't know a Henry.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.504
Well, then why did you kiss

14:36.584 --> 14:39.504
him on macaroni day?

14:39.546 --> 14:41.506
I didn't kiss him

14:39.546 --> 14:41.506

14:41.548 --> 14:43.383
or fish stick day

14:41.548 --> 14:43.383
or any day.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.385
Yeah, right.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.385
Where's my jacket?

14:45.426 --> 14:47.261
- I'm outta here.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.261
- Steve, wait!

14:47.303 --> 14:50.306
- How could you do--

14:47.303 --> 14:50.306
- I did not kiss him!

14:50.348 --> 14:52.016

14:50.348 --> 14:52.016
'Steve.'

14:52.058 --> 14:53.560
This is pure gold.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.731
Hey, Steph,

14:55.729 --> 14:57.731
how's your story coming?

14:57.772 --> 15:00.107
It's really heating up.

15:02.026 --> 15:04.863
"Just when their love

15:02.026 --> 15:04.863

15:12.453 --> 15:16.040

15:16.082 --> 15:19.627
- How's it sound?

15:16.082 --> 15:19.627
- Like Cleve needs a kleenex.

15:19.669 --> 15:21.128
No. No, I'm kidding.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.464
Honey, it's wonderful.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.464
Very creative.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.842
Thanks. I guess,

15:23.506 --> 15:25.842
I'm just gifted.

15:26.967 --> 15:28.344
Well, let's see

15:26.967 --> 15:28.344

15:28.386 --> 15:29.470

15:29.512 --> 15:31.264
It's your turn.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.099
Thank you.

15:33.140 --> 15:36.519
Steve, somebody wrote that

15:33.140 --> 15:36.519
note to get me in trouble.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.062
I'll tell you

15:36.561 --> 15:38.062
who's in trouble

15:38.104 --> 15:40.106

15:40.147 --> 15:41.608
- Steve, I told you--

15:40.147 --> 15:41.608
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:41.649 --> 15:45.069
Excuse me. Did you say

15:41.649 --> 15:45.069
macaroni man Henry?

15:45.111 --> 15:47.196
You know what you guys

15:45.111 --> 15:47.196
might wanna take a look

15:47.238 --> 15:48.489
at Steph's latest story.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.412
This is incredible!

15:51.618 --> 15:54.412
I don't believe this.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.372
Yeah. The same thing

15:54.454 --> 15:56.372
happened to us.

16:01.878 --> 16:03.838
Okay, boys and girls

16:01.878 --> 16:03.838
we have a new friend

16:03.880 --> 16:05.882
with us today,

16:03.880 --> 16:05.882
in the enchanted forest.

16:05.924 --> 16:09.260

Hey, Ranger Boy,

16:14.891 --> 16:16.768
would you like a sniff

16:16.810 --> 16:19.145
of my sweet

16:16.810 --> 16:19.145

16:19.186 --> 16:21.898

16:24.150 --> 16:26.736

16:24.150 --> 16:26.736

16:26.778 --> 16:29.572
What's on your nose?

16:26.778 --> 16:29.572
A lobster!

16:29.614 --> 16:30.657
Ow!

16:30.698 --> 16:32.742
[laughs]

16:36.663 --> 16:39.582
Cleve and P.J.'s romance

16:36.663 --> 16:39.582
was on the rocks.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.545
Steve, this jealousy is gonna

16:41.542 --> 16:44.545
to destroy us both.

16:44.587 --> 16:47.882
I know, this macaroni day

16:44.587 --> 16:47.882
incident has made me realize

16:47.924 --> 16:49.717
that we can't go on like this.

16:49.759 --> 16:50.885
Let's get married.

16:50.927 --> 16:52.428
[choking]

16:55.055 --> 16:57.433
How about tomorrow?

16:55.055 --> 16:57.433
It's a half-day at school.

16:57.475 --> 17:00.102
- Aww.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.688
Dad, we have to talk.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.815
That's what dads are for.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.359
Well, this dad

17:03.857 --> 17:06.359
better sit down.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.532
Here. Bite on this.

17:14.408 --> 17:16.953
Mr. Tanner, sir. Dad.

17:16.995 --> 17:19.121
I wanna marry your daughter.

17:19.163 --> 17:22.750
What? You've only known

17:19.163 --> 17:22.750
each other for three months.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.045
What took you so long, son?

17:27.964 --> 17:30.550
- Come here, sweetheart, oh.

17:27.964 --> 17:30.550
- Oh.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.426
- Aww.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.639
Dad, you can't be serious.

17:36.681 --> 17:38.224
Why not? It would

17:36.681 --> 17:38.224
work out great.

17:38.265 --> 17:40.100
They could live

17:38.265 --> 17:40.100
right here with us.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.811
They could take

17:40.142 --> 17:41.811
your room and-and Michelle

17:41.853 --> 17:42.937
could take D.J.'s room.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.689
Where am I gonna sleep?

17:44.731 --> 17:46.566
Oh, yeah, I..

17:46.607 --> 17:49.068
...I forgot about you.

17:49.109 --> 17:51.571
Oh, I-I could put a bath mat

17:49.109 --> 17:51.571
in the laundry room.

17:53.531 --> 17:56.242
That's where Comet sleeps.

17:56.283 --> 17:57.410
Oh, honey, that'd be great.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.412
You could keep

17:57.451 --> 17:59.412
each other warm.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.207
Dad, you can't

18:00.914 --> 18:03.207
do this to me.

18:03.249 --> 18:06.419
Why not? It would make a great

18:03.249 --> 18:06.419
ending to your story.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.967
My story?

18:14.802 --> 18:16.637
You read my story.

18:17.722 --> 18:19.974
So, uh, what'd you think?

18:21.642 --> 18:24.103
We think you did

18:21.642 --> 18:24.103
a pretty rotten thing.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.647
Steph, you can't disrupt

18:24.144 --> 18:26.647
people's lives

18:26.689 --> 18:28.482
just to make your story

18:26.689 --> 18:28.482
more interesting.

18:30.944 --> 18:33.237
I didn't mean

18:30.944 --> 18:33.237
to hurt anybody.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.822
I'm really sorry.

18:36.240 --> 18:38.117
Can you guys forgive me?

18:38.158 --> 18:39.827
Yeah, I guess.

18:39.869 --> 18:42.538
Okay, we're even now.

18:42.580 --> 18:44.206
Actually, all that talk

18:42.580 --> 18:44.206
about marriage

18:44.248 --> 18:46.292
really felt kind of right.

18:46.333 --> 18:49.045
Yeah. What do you say, dad?

18:53.049 --> 18:55.551
I say why don't you just forget

18:53.049 --> 18:55.551
about this marriage thing

18:55.593 --> 18:57.095
and I'll make you

21:52.352 --> 21:54.063
I did that?

21:54.105 --> 21:55.564
Alright!

21:56.983 --> 21:57.984
Good job, shorty.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.444
If you boys need any more help

22:00.486 --> 22:02.280
you know where my room is.

22:06.284 --> 22:08.995
Jess, I'm sorry, I made all

22:06.284 --> 22:08.995
those stupid hair comments.

22:09.036 --> 22:10.329
I-I was getting big laughs.

22:10.370 --> 22:12.331
I...I guess, I..

22:12.372 --> 22:13.791
...kind of got

22:12.372 --> 22:13.791
on a roll there.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.542
Oh, that's alright, I..

22:15.584 --> 22:17.336
...I was so uptight

22:15.584 --> 22:17.336
about getting that job.

22:17.377 --> 22:20.798
I was, I was way too

22:17.377 --> 22:20.798
sensitive and I overreacted.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.466
I'm sorry, pal.

22:22.508 --> 22:23.926
Hey, you know,

22:22.508 --> 22:23.926
when we were in advertising

22:23.968 --> 22:25.469
we made a pretty

22:23.968 --> 22:25.469
darn good team, you know.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.096
Maybe this radio gig

22:25.511 --> 22:27.096
will be fun.

22:27.138 --> 22:29.098
A little music,

22:27.138 --> 22:29.098
a little comedy.

22:29.140 --> 22:32.143
- A little paycheck.

22:29.140 --> 22:32.143
- 'Aha! I hear you.'

22:32.185 --> 22:33.519
Let me tell you

22:32.185 --> 22:33.519
the best part.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.271
The best part would be

22:33.560 --> 22:35.271
that I'd get to work

22:35.313 --> 22:38.107
every day with

22:35.313 --> 22:38.107
a really great friend.

22:38.149 --> 22:40.818
So, what do you say, pal?

22:40.860 --> 22:42.903
Partners again?

22:42.945 --> 22:44.488
Hey, I say,

22:42.945 --> 22:44.488
let's do it.

22:44.530 --> 22:45.739
Alright. Come on.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.867
- I'll make you a sundae.

22:45.781 --> 22:47.867
- Alright.

22:49.243 --> 22:50.786
Jess, I promise

22:49.243 --> 22:50.786
when we do the show

22:50.828 --> 22:52.330
no more of the stupid

22:50.828 --> 22:52.330
hair jokes.

22:52.370 --> 22:53.873
Oh, it's okay, Joe.

22:52.370 --> 22:53.873
You can trash my hair

22:53.914 --> 22:55.875
all you want.

22:53.914 --> 22:55.875
Just don't touch it.

22:55.916 --> 22:58.460
[chuckles]

22:55.916 --> 22:58.460
I don't wanna touch it.

22:58.502 --> 22:59.753
Might wanna drive

22:58.502 --> 22:59.753
through it, though.

22:59.795 --> 23:02.715
My car could use the lube job.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.424
Now, you've gone too far,

23:02.756 --> 23:04.424
bullwinkle brain.

23:04.466 --> 23:05.843
- Dippity-doo head.

23:04.466 --> 23:05.843
- Bullwinkle brain.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.803
- Dippity-doo head.

23:05.885 --> 23:07.803
- Bullwinkle brain.

23:09.387 --> 23:11.473
