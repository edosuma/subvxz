WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.094
Mom!

00:06.120 --> 00:09.511
I know. But, maybe you're
just not seeing her side.

00:09.541 --> 00:12.290
- No, of course I'm not taking her side!
- Do you want me to help with that?

00:12.300 --> 00:14.449
No. No, we're good.

00:14.479 --> 00:16.199
- Thanks for asking, though.
- OK, I will.

00:16.200 --> 00:18.419
Yep. Yeah, I'll call her
tomorrow and everything

00:18.420 --> 00:21.409
will be sorted out. OK. Bye.

00:26.830 --> 00:29.169
- Everything OK?
- Yeah.

00:29.170 --> 00:31.830
Just my mom.
She lives for drama.

00:31.860 --> 00:33.419
- Sounds like my family.

00:33.420 --> 00:35.087
If there was a Real Housewives of Turkey,

00:35.117 --> 00:37.219
- my mother would be the star.
- I swear, it's like...

00:37.220 --> 00:39.739
Whatever issue my mom's dealing with,
I end up in the middle.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.729
It's like somehow it becomes my problem.

00:41.730 --> 00:44.569
Try being your family's
resident problem solver, OK?

00:44.570 --> 00:47.049
Any little thing that bothers them,
they call Oz.

00:47.050 --> 00:49.250
OK, their boss pissed them off?
They call Oz.

00:49.450 --> 00:51.140
Traffic incident?
They call Oz.

00:51.150 --> 00:54.879
Any reason to complain about anything,
they call Oz.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.180
It's exhausting.

00:59.270 --> 01:01.959
- You're awfully quiet over there.
- Well, I mean...

01:01.960 --> 01:04.789
You guys are pretty much my
only family, it'd be rude of me

01:04.819 --> 01:06.900
to complain in front of you,
don't you think?

01:06.930 --> 01:08.609
Yeah, you just got yourself lucky

01:08.610 --> 01:10.600
that you don't have to deal with
all this family crap.

01:11.070 --> 01:12.137
Mm-mm.

01:12.760 --> 01:15.260
I don't know about that, you
guys keep my hands pretty full.

01:16.292 --> 01:19.550
- Want some milk, babe?
- Yeah, sure.

01:23.189 --> 01:26.828
Come here!
Ha! Ha! Ha!

01:32.124 --> 01:35.060
Now why do I get the sense
that I'm being hustled, huh?

01:35.070 --> 01:37.770
Because you are, Finny, baby.
Because you are.

01:42.107 --> 01:44.320
We're all out of bubbly, Fin.

01:45.040 --> 01:46.590
Oh no, no, no.

01:47.882 --> 01:49.906
Fin is never out of anything.

01:51.405 --> 01:52.723
Grant?

01:54.830 --> 01:56.460
Graaant?

01:56.490 --> 01:58.170
I don't think he can hear you.

01:58.780 --> 02:00.972
OK. I'll be right back.

02:01.002 --> 02:04.930
- Grant?
- Ha! Ha! Ha! Woo!

02:04.960 --> 02:08.360
Hey Fin, how 'bout some
more strawberries, too?

02:09.600 --> 02:12.160
Oh yeah, I'll show you strawberries.

02:12.354 --> 02:15.054
... Oh.

02:23.169 --> 02:24.622
What are you doing here?

02:25.089 --> 02:27.309
Fin, who are you talking to?

02:28.830 --> 02:30.730
That's not going to make me
change my mind.

02:31.180 --> 02:33.710
- I told you we're done.
- I can find my own way out.

02:41.022 --> 02:42.943
Ah! Ah! Aaaah!

03:00.320 --> 03:02.309
Victim's Fin Geoffrey Nightingale,

03:02.339 --> 03:04.060
shot three times in the chest.

03:04.090 --> 03:05.829
Guess the killer wanted
to make sure he was dead.

03:05.830 --> 03:07.040
No kiddin'.

03:07.070 --> 03:09.109
And he was shot close range with a 9mm.

03:09.110 --> 03:10.819
Fin Nightingale,
why do I know that name?

03:10.820 --> 03:13.100
Well, you ever heard of
the Gale Stores?

03:13.110 --> 03:14.939
They're a high-end retail chain.

03:14.940 --> 03:17.479
Fin Nightingale was the
president of Nightingale ltd.

03:17.480 --> 03:19.460
His brother Topher
is second in command.

03:19.470 --> 03:21.629
Yeah, it's a family business.
It's actually a very

03:21.659 --> 03:23.850
- interesting story...
- Corporal.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.409
To make a long story short,

03:27.410 --> 03:29.239
the Nightingale empire spans from

03:29.240 --> 03:30.649
clothing stores to golf clubs.

03:30.650 --> 03:32.596
Not to mention that every museum

03:32.626 --> 03:34.848
and hospital in the city has a wing
named after them.

03:34.878 --> 03:35.861
That's a lot of money.

03:35.891 --> 03:37.529
Yes. Which translates to a lot of power.

03:37.559 --> 03:39.710
Fin and his brother have a lot
of friends in high places.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.189
Needless to say,
there's a lot of pressure

03:41.190 --> 03:43.285
to solve this case and solve it quick.

03:43.315 --> 03:44.899
- We'll want to speak with the brother.
- Yes, of course.

03:44.929 --> 03:45.839
So what do we know?

03:45.869 --> 03:47.559
The killer came in through
the servant's entrance,

03:47.560 --> 03:49.619
nothing appears to have been
stolen but we're still checking.

03:49.620 --> 03:50.980
Any witnesses?

03:51.060 --> 03:55.010
Yeah, there were two uh... women

03:55.030 --> 03:56.719
with him here last night.

03:56.720 --> 04:00.520
Uh, but the family butler,
one Grant Evans, who's lived

04:00.550 --> 04:03.269
on the premises for decades,
he wasn't here last night.

04:03.299 --> 04:06.209
- Where was he? - We have a unit
out looking for him right now.

04:06.210 --> 04:07.322
We'll speak with the girls,

04:07.352 --> 04:11.398
find out what they saw exactly.
I'm guessing that's them there?

04:11.428 --> 04:15.520
Ye. Well at least he died
with a smile on his face.

04:16.035 --> 04:17.390
Dev.

04:20.680 --> 04:23.140
Thank you for speaking with us Ms. Smith.

04:23.170 --> 04:26.700
Of course. I feel like
I'm in a nightmare.

04:26.730 --> 04:29.069
Like I'm still waiting
to wake up, you know?

04:29.070 --> 04:30.359
I know it's been a long night.

04:30.360 --> 04:34.180
What was your relationship
with Fin like?

04:35.800 --> 04:37.000
Social.

04:38.960 --> 04:41.610
Any ideas who might've
wanted to kill him?

04:41.640 --> 04:45.210
Honestly, I didn't really
know him very well, but...

04:45.870 --> 04:48.989
- But what?
- Well, he's Fin Nightingale.

04:48.990 --> 04:51.109
One of the richest playboys
in the country.

04:51.110 --> 04:54.920
A guy that powerful, I'd imagine
he had some enemies.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.589
Well, in statement
you had mentioned

04:57.590 --> 05:00.289
that you heard a woman's voice
before the shorts were fired.

05:00.290 --> 05:02.099
Yes, I'm pretty sure.

05:02.100 --> 05:05.620
- Do you remember what you heard?
- I couldn't make it out...

05:06.450 --> 05:08.209
But he was definitely talking
to a woman.

05:08.210 --> 05:10.232
Do you remember anything else?

05:11.840 --> 05:15.059
I do remember seeing this guy,
I think he was staff...

05:15.060 --> 05:16.415
Snooping around earlier that night.

05:16.445 --> 05:18.819
Like, he was being
all sneaky and stuff.

05:18.820 --> 05:20.449
I didn't think much of it at the time,

05:20.450 --> 05:24.660
but he seemed like he didn't want us
to know he was there.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.079
You're talking about the butler?

05:26.080 --> 05:29.500
- Yeah. What was his name?
- Grant Evans.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.779
I've served three generations
of Nightingales,

05:32.780 --> 05:35.200
I was there the day Fin was brought
home from the hospital.

05:35.590 --> 05:38.350
He was... like a son to me.

05:39.380 --> 05:41.459
- You're not my father.
- Thank god for that.

05:41.460 --> 05:44.439
You're an embarrassment
to the Nightingale name.

05:44.440 --> 05:47.148
You talk to me like that
again, you're fired.

05:48.750 --> 05:51.970
We heard there was some animosity
between the two of you.

05:52.580 --> 05:55.430
Fin and I had our differences.

05:55.460 --> 05:59.500
I wished he could've conducted
himself more like his father.

05:59.650 --> 06:03.460
With more dignity,
more... self-restraint.

06:03.470 --> 06:05.720
Was Fin aware that you felt that way?

06:06.400 --> 06:08.480
He was...

06:08.600 --> 06:10.470
He played with fire.

06:12.130 --> 06:14.370
Where were you last night
during the shooting?

06:14.970 --> 06:17.550
I had the night off and was
spending it at a colleague's.

06:17.630 --> 06:19.029
We have a witness who saw you

06:19.030 --> 06:21.120
at the Nightingale residence
around 7:30.

06:21.590 --> 06:22.429
That's correct.

06:22.430 --> 06:24.790
I forgot my cellphone and
went back to retrieve it.

06:25.130 --> 06:27.019
I was only in the house
for about 5 minutes.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.420
No one saw you leave?

06:29.108 --> 06:33.130
It's my job to at least
attempt to be invisible.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.209
I'm afraid my entrances
and exits don't warrant

06:35.210 --> 06:36.939
an announcement, sergeant.

06:36.940 --> 06:40.859
Well, over the years you must've
seen and heard many things.

06:40.860 --> 06:43.749
Arguments, conversations
with coworkers,

06:43.750 --> 06:45.559
- ex-girlfriends.
- Of course.

06:45.560 --> 06:48.450
Broke their hearts.
Despised by his brother.

06:48.980 --> 06:51.910
What was Fin's relationship
like with his younger brother?

06:51.960 --> 06:53.270
- Topher?
- Yeah.

06:53.730 --> 06:55.520
They got along for the most part.

06:55.740 --> 06:59.230
- Were they competitive with one another?
- You could say that.

07:00.152 --> 07:02.984
The truth is... Topher spent his life

07:03.014 --> 07:05.110
living in his brother's shadow.

07:05.140 --> 07:06.900
Their father always favoured Fin,

07:06.920 --> 07:09.420
left him in control of the company
when he died.

07:09.450 --> 07:11.470
Topher probably didn't like that.

07:11.540 --> 07:13.322
Would anyone?

07:14.970 --> 07:18.430
We understand that Fin
was a bit of a playboy.

07:18.810 --> 07:22.280
There anyone in particular
where things ended badly?

07:22.810 --> 07:24.353
Maybe...

07:25.169 --> 07:27.381
It's not right!

07:30.502 --> 07:33.279
Never let that woman back
in my house ever again.

07:33.810 --> 07:35.378
Of course.

07:36.940 --> 07:38.808
Any women come to mind?

07:39.013 --> 07:41.201
A bitter ex? A lover?

07:41.430 --> 07:45.269
Just the other day a young
lady came to the house,

07:45.270 --> 07:47.110
she'd been once or twice before.

07:47.140 --> 07:51.400
Each time she left furious.

07:51.720 --> 07:55.520
And Fin would lock himself in
his office for hours after her.

07:55.940 --> 07:57.490
But I never got a name.

07:58.800 --> 08:00.880
I'm sorry I can't be more helpful.

08:03.100 --> 08:03.799
Thank you.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.390
Alright, let's put that together.

08:06.032 --> 08:08.830
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

08:08.990 --> 08:10.319
OK, I think that should do it.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.552
I'm going to run this
and see what comes up.

08:11.582 --> 08:12.881
Nice.

08:14.570 --> 08:16.263
That our prime suspect?

08:16.293 --> 08:17.959
Yeah, right now anything's possible.

08:17.960 --> 08:20.459
Grant saw this person and Fin fight.

08:20.460 --> 08:21.989
The girls, Aimsley and Rachel,

08:21.990 --> 08:23.760
they heard Fin talking to the killer.

08:23.790 --> 08:26.030
They're pretty sure that
it was a female voice.

08:26.060 --> 08:27.519
How do we know those
girls aren't involved?

08:27.549 --> 08:29.790
Well, we tested their clothing
and hands for gunshot residue,

08:29.820 --> 08:30.910
there was nothing.

08:30.940 --> 08:33.260
And the butler's alibi also checks out.

08:33.500 --> 08:35.505
What about Topher Nightingale,
the brother?

08:35.534 --> 08:36.990
That's who we're talking to next.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.909
He's at... 27 Kingsford Place.

08:40.370 --> 08:42.696
- That's Fin's estate.
- Not anymore.

08:42.726 --> 08:44.929
I had Fin's legal papers sent over.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.709
The Nightingale fortune is in trust
and handed down

08:47.710 --> 08:50.250
to the next in line, so
the estate now belongs to...

08:50.930 --> 08:52.736
Topher Nightingale.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.343
Lucky him.

08:55.864 --> 08:56.978
Huh.

09:02.330 --> 09:03.440
Excuse me?

09:05.096 --> 09:06.412
Excuse me?

09:09.306 --> 09:10.895
Mr. Nightingale?

09:13.404 --> 09:14.559
I'm Sergeant Mcclusky.

09:14.560 --> 09:15.949
This is Special Consultant Logan.

09:15.950 --> 09:17.769
- Hello.
- We'd like to ask you a couple

09:17.799 --> 09:20.336
- of questions about your brother.
- Yes, anything.

09:20.366 --> 09:22.130
Do you have any idea who
could've done this?

09:22.290 --> 09:24.909
No. Not yet, unfortunately.

09:24.910 --> 09:26.600
He was the only family I had left.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.769
So, the Nightingale lineage
stops with you?

09:29.305 --> 09:30.840
Unfortunately, yes.

09:30.870 --> 09:32.509
So, that would make you
the sole heir to

09:32.510 --> 09:34.430
the entire Nightingale fortune.

09:34.850 --> 09:36.710
Yes, I guess you're right.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.700
I'm sorry, I just can't believe
Fin's gone.

09:40.430 --> 09:42.700
And with him, my problems, too.

09:43.790 --> 09:45.160
Where were you last night?

09:45.890 --> 09:48.579
Me? I was at work till 11.

09:48.580 --> 09:50.830
We're gearing up for our annual GM.

09:51.641 --> 09:53.272
Why wasn't Fin with you?

09:53.600 --> 09:55.369
My brother never really
worked late nights.

09:55.370 --> 09:57.430
What was your relationship
like with Fin?

09:58.140 --> 10:00.480
Like I said, Finny was
a great older brother.

10:00.680 --> 10:03.140
We were friends, we were co-workers.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.930
He tried to push me out
of the company.

10:06.140 --> 10:08.490
So, things were good between you two?

10:08.810 --> 10:10.960
Things couldn't have been better.

10:12.270 --> 10:14.170
Rigands gave me your number.

10:15.360 --> 10:18.060
So you can't think of anyone
who'd want to kill your brother?

10:19.300 --> 10:20.869
Fin was as famous
for the women he dated

10:20.870 --> 10:22.510
as he was for his money.

10:23.170 --> 10:26.520
I wouldn't be surprised if some
old girlfriend is behind this.

10:26.530 --> 10:28.590
So no one particular comes to mind?

10:29.630 --> 10:31.680
I wish I knew more, but no, I...

10:32.420 --> 10:34.510
I have no idea who killed my brother.

10:34.835 --> 10:36.890
Alright, thank you.
That's all for now.

10:40.660 --> 10:42.620
He almost seemed relieved
his brother was dead.

10:42.790 --> 10:44.340
Well, you think he's involved?

10:44.930 --> 10:46.292
He thought something about Fin

10:46.322 --> 10:47.375
ushing him out of the company,

10:47.419 --> 10:50.410
then I saw him on the phone
mentioning someone named Rigands.

10:50.830 --> 10:51.989
Dev, what's going on?

10:51.990 --> 10:54.019
I got a match on that sketch from Toby.

10:54.020 --> 10:57.700
A facial reconition ID'd her from
a military database as one...

10:58.340 --> 11:01.455
Carlie Hutton. Age 25,

11:01.485 --> 11:02.879
did two tours in Afghanistan,

11:02.880 --> 11:04.716
was honourably discharged
two months ago.

11:04.746 --> 11:06.309
I looked into her military records.

11:06.310 --> 11:07.920
Annual rifle and pistol qualifications

11:07.950 --> 11:09.629
she scored as an expert shot,

11:09.630 --> 11:12.240
- year after year.
- Anything else?

11:13.070 --> 11:15.559
Yeah, we showed her
picture to Grant Evans,

11:15.560 --> 11:16.439
the butler.

11:16.469 --> 11:17.016
OK.

11:17.046 --> 11:19.139
He said he thinks that was
the girl who he saw arguing

11:19.169 --> 11:20.989
- with Fin that night.
- Yeah, let's bring her in.

11:20.990 --> 11:23.156
Yeah, and I need you to look
into Topher Nightingale,

11:23.186 --> 11:25.609
check his finances, phone
records and anything to do

11:25.639 --> 11:26.919
- with someone named Rigands.
- Yeah.

11:26.920 --> 11:29.300
- Got it, will do. 
- OK, thanks. Bye.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.669
Oh, the lovely Tia.

11:32.670 --> 11:35.783
To what do we own the honor to
your accompany this afternoon?

11:35.813 --> 11:38.144
Just thought I'd drop by
and grab me some lunch.

11:38.174 --> 11:40.589
Oh, well.
Can I recommend the albacore tuna?

11:40.590 --> 11:43.392
- The caper sauce is amazing.
- Oh, well that sounds great.

11:43.422 --> 11:46.644
Um, I think I'll have the
club with a side of pickles.

11:46.674 --> 11:48.570
Alright. The usual.

11:53.020 --> 11:55.040
You didn't just come
here for lunch, did you?

11:55.070 --> 11:58.539
- Am I that obvious?
- Cop a squat, come on.

11:58.540 --> 12:00.099
- Lay it on me. What do you got?
- Well, it's...

12:00.100 --> 12:03.460
It's Toby, I mean you know him
better than anyone, right?

12:03.984 --> 12:05.584
I guess that's true, yeah.

12:05.614 --> 12:08.299
I've been thinking a lot about his past

12:08.300 --> 12:12.034
and he's got a complicated history.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.076
OK, where are you going with this?

12:15.820 --> 12:18.281
It's just...
he says he doesn't want to know

12:18.480 --> 12:21.210
what happened to his mom
but I don't believe him.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.290
I mean, I can see he's hurting.

12:23.472 --> 12:26.710
You know, it's a complicated
issue and quite frankly,

12:26.740 --> 12:29.399
in his position, a little
denial doesn't hurt.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.630
- But he has other options.
- Like what?

12:31.660 --> 12:34.040
Like, he can try to find answers.

12:34.070 --> 12:36.650
That's what I do for a
living, I find answers,

12:37.240 --> 12:40.080
and I was hoping you could help, too.

12:41.079 --> 12:42.481
I don't think that's a good idea.

12:42.511 --> 12:44.119
I mean, I don't know what
he's told you, but...

12:44.120 --> 12:44.799
Pff. Hardly anything.

12:44.800 --> 12:46.301
OK, well then that's for a reason.

12:46.331 --> 12:49.001
Alright, he's probably
trying to protect you.

12:49.260 --> 12:50.900
Protect me from what?

12:50.920 --> 12:53.309
Would I need to be protected
from Toby's past?

12:53.310 --> 12:55.244
OK, Iâ€™ve side too much, alright.
You want a sandwich?

12:55.274 --> 12:57.540
I'll get you a sandwich, but
anything else, you're on your own.

12:57.920 --> 13:01.902
And if you want to know about
Toby's past, ask Toby.

13:12.520 --> 13:15.340
It says here that you did
two tours in Afghanistan?

13:15.600 --> 13:17.190
Yeah, yeah. Just got out.

13:17.610 --> 13:19.954
Still trying to figure out what
I want to do with my life.

13:20.880 --> 13:23.040
I'm sorry, you still haven't
told me why I'm here.

13:23.070 --> 13:24.719
Actually, yeah. We have a few questions

13:24.720 --> 13:27.053
about one of your friends.

13:27.465 --> 13:29.053
Friend?

13:30.480 --> 13:33.590
- That guy?
- Fin Nightingale.

13:33.650 --> 13:35.229
I uh, never heard of him

13:35.230 --> 13:36.849
until I saw his picture in
the paper this morning.

13:36.850 --> 13:39.400
So you never met him at his house?

13:39.430 --> 13:41.144
No, never.

13:47.767 --> 13:49.999
We have witness who saw
you at Fin's house.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.653
The conversations between
the two of you got heated?

13:52.683 --> 13:55.880
Huh! Well it's not true.
Whoever told you that is lying.

13:56.770 --> 13:58.537
Where were you last night, Carlie?

13:58.780 --> 14:00.650
Uhh... home.

14:00.680 --> 14:01.899
Did anyone see you?

14:01.900 --> 14:03.760
No, probably not.

14:03.770 --> 14:06.769
You know, lying to us is only going
to get you into more trouble.

14:06.770 --> 14:08.450
I'm telling you the truth.

14:09.090 --> 14:11.500
How would someone like me
know Someone like him?

14:12.026 --> 14:14.163
Why aren't they believe me?

14:16.950 --> 14:18.799
I don't know, it's like
she is trying to convince us

14:18.800 --> 14:20.019
she doesn't know Fin.

14:20.020 --> 14:21.370
Could she be lying?

14:21.920 --> 14:23.269
She could be, I guess.

14:23.270 --> 14:24.859
But my reads of Grant were clear

14:24.889 --> 14:25.949
and my reads of Carlie

14:25.950 --> 14:28.079
weren' t contradicting
anything she was saying.

14:28.080 --> 14:29.919
Maybe Grant saw Carlie somewhere else

14:29.920 --> 14:31.629
and just mixed up the context.

14:31.630 --> 14:34.560
- Does that happen?
- It's possible.

14:35.884 --> 14:37.849
What about the younger brother?
Tell me about him.

14:37.850 --> 14:39.880
Topher Nightingale, right.
Um...

14:39.910 --> 14:41.421
I got a read of him on a phone call

14:41.451 --> 14:43.119
talking about someone named Rigands.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.570
- Is that a clear read?
- Yeah.

14:46.220 --> 14:48.040
Had to ask.

14:48.070 --> 14:50.840
So I haven't been able to ID
this Rigands character,

14:50.850 --> 14:53.400
but I did manage to trace three
calls made from Topher'cell

14:53.430 --> 14:55.009
to a highly secure VOIP address.

14:55.010 --> 14:56.170
Now two of those calls

14:56.190 --> 14:58.546
came before Fin's murder
and the last one,

14:58.576 --> 15:00.549
six hours after Fin's time of death.

15:00.550 --> 15:02.689
Who's the VOIP address belong to?

15:02.690 --> 15:04.690
It's hidden behind an IP spoof er so

15:04.700 --> 15:05.889
it's going to take me a little bit of time

15:05.890 --> 15:07.289
to trace it back to its origin.

15:07.290 --> 15:09.339
- That's pretty suspicious.
- Yeah, and it gets more so.

15:09.340 --> 15:10.969
I looked into his finances and

15:10.970 --> 15:14.279
I found a money transfer from his
line of credit for 60 grand.

15:14.280 --> 15:15.590
What's odd about that?

15:15.860 --> 15:17.369
Well, the money was transferred to

15:17.370 --> 15:19.459
a numbered account
in the Cayman Islands,

15:19.460 --> 15:21.319
just an hour after the second call

15:21.320 --> 15:23.629
was made to that secure VOIP address.

15:23.630 --> 15:27.069
Well, 60 grand, that's chump
change for a Nightingale.

15:27.070 --> 15:30.749
To Fin Nightingale, yes.
But not so much for Topher.

15:30.750 --> 15:32.179
What are you saying Topher's broke?

15:32.180 --> 15:33.000
About two years ago

15:33.010 --> 15:35.669
Topher lost most of his
inheritance to bad investments.

15:35.670 --> 15:37.039
Since then, he's been

15:37.040 --> 15:38.509
staying afloat off of borrowed money,

15:38.510 --> 15:40.200
just trying to keep up appearances.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.069
Wait, so he loses his money,

15:42.070 --> 15:44.079
he's getting kicked out
of the family business...

15:44.080 --> 15:46.599
And he makes two calls
to a secured line

15:46.600 --> 15:47.939
right before his brother's killed?

15:47.940 --> 15:51.210
Transfers 60 grand he doesn't
have the Caymans.

15:51.340 --> 15:52.750
You thinking what I am thinking?

15:52.800 --> 15:55.430
He hired a contract killer
to get rid of his brother.

16:01.170 --> 16:04.160
Can you tell me who these
three calls were made to?

16:10.250 --> 16:12.220
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

16:13.520 --> 16:15.280
What's your price?

16:15.680 --> 16:17.419
Well why don't you tell
us about the 60 grand

16:17.420 --> 16:19.030
you transferred 5 days ago?

16:19.220 --> 16:20.890
- 60 grand?
- Mm-hmm.

16:21.250 --> 16:23.269
You expect me to remember
how I spent 60 grand?

16:23.270 --> 16:24.680
I spend more for breakfast.

16:24.690 --> 16:29.310
Really? You didn't lose 90%
of your inheritance in

16:29.320 --> 16:32.270
- the market meltdown last year?
- Excuse me?

16:32.300 --> 16:34.256
Am I getting my information wrong?

16:34.753 --> 16:35.829
I don't remember.

16:35.830 --> 16:38.039
Maybe you can remember who you
transferred the money to.

16:38.040 --> 16:40.019
It was to a numbered
account in the Caymans.

16:40.020 --> 16:41.280
I don't remember.

16:41.780 --> 16:44.190
You have to spend money
to make money.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.700
Do you know who killed your brother.

16:46.730 --> 16:48.690
No, of course not.

16:49.530 --> 16:52.160
How do I get to Fin?
I need to talk to him.

16:53.310 --> 16:57.002
There are consequences
for actions, Mr. Nightingale.

16:59.110 --> 17:01.439
You sure? 'Cause if you're not
telling us something...

17:01.800 --> 17:04.079
Listen. You may not realize
but I passed the bar,

17:04.079 --> 17:06.220
so I am very aware of my rights.

17:06.550 --> 17:08.279
Unless you're prepared to arrest me,

17:08.280 --> 17:10.170
this interrogation is over.

17:14.180 --> 17:15.419
So he slammed the door and then

17:15.420 --> 17:17.189
she talked about consequences.

17:17.190 --> 17:19.200
Yeah, do you think she's
our contract killer?

17:19.210 --> 17:21.128
I can't be sure, but he mentioned
something about

17:21.130 --> 17:22.858
spending money to make money.

17:22.859 --> 17:23.939
Well, she's our only link right now,

17:23.940 --> 17:24.919
we need to find her.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.069
Do you want to make a sketch of her?

17:26.069 --> 17:27.239
I think we can do better than that.

17:27.240 --> 17:28.829
I saw her put her hands
on Topher's door,

17:28.830 --> 17:30.219
I think we can get her fingerprints.

17:30.220 --> 17:31.890
- OK, let me talk to Alex.
- OK.

17:32.880 --> 17:33.899
Hopefully this mystery woman

17:33.900 --> 17:36.060
- will give us some answers.
- Michelle.

17:42.440 --> 17:44.056
Hey!

17:44.124 --> 17:47.220
Hi.

17:47.250 --> 17:48.791
What's up?

17:49.330 --> 17:50.789
Nothing. Just thought
it might be nice

17:50.790 --> 17:52.879
to come home to a nice meal is all.

17:52.880 --> 17:55.255
Yeah, I can smell that.

17:57.080 --> 18:00.649
Sit. Try it. It's a favourite
of mine growing up.

18:00.650 --> 18:05.449
What? I just... Why... is this...?

18:05.450 --> 18:07.320
I really am transparent, aren't I?

18:07.450 --> 18:09.509
Yeah. A little bit,
but that's a good thing.

18:09.510 --> 18:12.560
So honestly, what is this?
What'd you do?

18:13.150 --> 18:14.640
When we were talking,

18:14.670 --> 18:18.679
you know, about families and parents.
I just...

18:18.680 --> 18:20.709
I think it must be hard for you

18:20.710 --> 18:23.530
After all these years not
knowing where your mother is.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.374
Uh - huh.
My mother.

18:27.460 --> 18:29.176
That's what this is about?

18:29.890 --> 18:34.109
Honestly, not much to know, really.

18:34.110 --> 18:36.635
OK well, what's not much?

18:36.950 --> 18:40.860
Well... Her name was Maya.

18:41.670 --> 18:43.949
And I remember she used to like to

18:43.950 --> 18:46.479
sing along to Janis Joplin Songs

18:46.480 --> 18:50.570
and she was last seen
in a town named Auburn.

18:51.170 --> 18:54.970
- She... She...
- What?

18:56.860 --> 18:58.940
Why are you so interested
in this anyway?

18:59.170 --> 19:01.349
Because this is your life and
I want to be a part of it.

19:01.350 --> 19:04.319
- You are a part of it.
- But... I don't get it.

19:04.320 --> 19:06.919
I mean, don't you want to know
where you come from

19:06.920 --> 19:09.659
- or who your family is?
- Yeah, of course. Yeah, I do.

19:09.660 --> 19:11.139
Look, I looked into it.

19:11.169 --> 19:12.469
- But it's a dead end.
- OK.

19:12.510 --> 19:14.250
- Trust me.
- I just...

19:14.280 --> 19:16.620
- I just thought...
- I know what you thought.

19:16.940 --> 19:19.171
I appreciate it.

19:20.130 --> 19:21.990
My past is my past.

19:22.910 --> 19:26.960
I'm happy here with you,
in the present. OK?

19:28.527 --> 19:31.080
What's in the soup? Looks great.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.540
Well, we got an ID from the
prints that we got at Topher's.

19:37.860 --> 19:39.560
Meet Natalie Gall.

19:39.810 --> 19:42.129
Ex-cop, kicked off the force
for substance abuse.

19:42.130 --> 19:43.899
Yeah, went to rehab,
cleaned herself up

19:43.900 --> 19:45.910
and she seems to have stayed
out of trouble ever since.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.329
So what's she doing now?

19:47.330 --> 19:50.590
- She's working as a PI.
- So how's she involved in this?

19:50.680 --> 19:53.360
You can ask her yourself,
she's on her way up.

19:53.460 --> 19:55.670
Ah, I got the short straw. Nice.

19:56.060 --> 19:59.220
So, you were at the Nightingale
residence recently?

19:59.610 --> 20:02.980
Nightingale? I have no idea
who you're talking about.

20:03.260 --> 20:05.429
They know. How do they know?

20:05.430 --> 20:08.640
We found your fingerprints at
Topher nightingale's residence.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.620
We know that he hired you.

20:11.570 --> 20:13.700
I wasn't hired by Topher.

20:13.970 --> 20:15.240
So, why were you there?

20:15.610 --> 20:18.660
I thought he was the father but
the DNA wasn't a perfect match.

20:18.700 --> 20:21.600
You were looking for
someone's biological father?

20:21.670 --> 20:24.070
Yeah, hardest case of my career.

20:24.310 --> 20:26.619
All I had to go on was
an adoption file that

20:26.620 --> 20:29.060
led to "Nowheresville" and back.
It was a mess.

20:29.490 --> 20:31.259
He only information that was filled in

20:31.260 --> 20:33.459
was a surname in the
birth father's column

20:33.460 --> 20:34.589
and an address.

20:34.590 --> 20:38.140
So all you had to go on
was the name Nightingale?

20:38.390 --> 20:42.060
- Not nightingale. York.
- Who's York?

20:42.120 --> 20:44.570
The address I was given
was for a Gale Store.

20:44.710 --> 20:47.200
That's the Nightingale's retail chain.

20:47.340 --> 20:48.759
Yeah, at first I thought it was a joke.

20:48.760 --> 20:51.540
Somebody leaving a department
store as their home address.

20:52.220 --> 20:54.679
Then I dug a little deeper
and it turns out York

20:54.680 --> 20:57.200
is the maiden name of Fin
and Topher's mother.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.239
You have the DNA test to prove this?

21:01.240 --> 21:04.260
Yeah, I got a sample off
a coffee cup Fin threw away.

21:04.740 --> 21:06.520
And it's a perfect match.

21:07.060 --> 21:08.600
So who's your client?

21:08.860 --> 21:12.109
She gave me a bogus name;
clients do it all the time.

21:12.110 --> 21:14.280
They want their anonymity,
so they fake their identity.

21:14.290 --> 21:15.750
What'd she look like?

21:15.780 --> 21:18.920
Brown hair, brown eyes,
about 5' 4...

21:24.170 --> 21:26.520
This is him? This is my father?

21:34.000 --> 21:35.671
Is that your client?

21:36.550 --> 21:38.662
Yeah, that's her.

21:41.550 --> 21:43.739
So, Carlie is Fin's daughter?

21:43.740 --> 21:44.879
Yeah, I don't know how she did it,

21:44.880 --> 21:46.890
but she's been lying to us
the whole time.

21:54.830 --> 21:56.246
Is that her?

21:56.420 --> 21:58.620
Yep, that's the girl who hired me.

21:59.200 --> 22:00.290
You sure?

22:01.360 --> 22:04.090
Yes, that's Fin Nightingale's daughter.

22:04.480 --> 22:05.908
Alright.

22:10.860 --> 22:13.119
Already told you that I
never knew Fin Nightingale.

22:13.120 --> 22:14.839
Yeah, you did mention that already.

22:14.840 --> 22:16.770
Alright, so let's leave Fin Nightingale
out of this for a second.

22:16.780 --> 22:18.210
Let's talk about Natalie Gall,

22:18.490 --> 22:20.079
the private investigator you hired.

22:20.080 --> 22:22.820
A PI? Are you kidding?

22:22.900 --> 22:26.649
Why on earth would I hire a PI?
That makes no sense.

22:26.650 --> 22:28.270
I don't have that kind of cash.

22:28.760 --> 22:30.800
What are they trying to make me say?

22:31.570 --> 22:34.110
So you're saying
you didn't hire a PI

22:34.120 --> 22:35.949
to track down your biological parents?

22:35.950 --> 22:37.350
No, of course not.

22:37.600 --> 22:40.320
So you didn't know that
Fin Nightingale was your father.

22:41.340 --> 22:44.129
That's why the cops took my DNA.

22:44.130 --> 22:45.970
Andrew Hutton was my father.

22:48.680 --> 22:50.820
He worked in construction
his whole life.

22:50.830 --> 22:53.109
He died with my mom
in a car accident last year.

22:53.110 --> 22:54.600
Fin Nightingale...

22:56.010 --> 22:57.130
Not my father.

22:57.520 --> 22:59.590
Did you kill Fin Nightingale?

22:59.900 --> 23:01.320
Oh, my G...

23:02.740 --> 23:04.710
I don't want to talk about any of this.
I want a lawyer.

23:05.200 --> 23:08.530
- I want to talk to a lawyer. 
- OK.

23:11.770 --> 23:13.490
She's not making this easy.

23:14.090 --> 23:16.099
Look, I've read people with
multiple personalities,

23:16.100 --> 23:18.870
con-artists, even a few
psychopaths and

23:19.140 --> 23:21.269
their reads are always a bit off.

23:21.270 --> 23:23.190
With Carlie, I'm reading her clearly.

23:23.200 --> 23:25.539
She's thinking of a reality
that she believes in.

23:25.540 --> 23:27.099
We need to keep pressing her.

23:27.100 --> 23:28.839
What if she's on some type
of medication

23:28.840 --> 23:30.909
that's blocking your reads,
you know, like Tia.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.420
- Yeah, no, no.
- You can't read Tia.

23:32.600 --> 23:36.039
Tia... The meds, they block
it like a closed door.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.110
With Carlie, it's wide open.

23:38.120 --> 23:39.079
I can see everything.

23:39.080 --> 23:42.470
Corporal, look into Carlie's
medical history, anyway.

23:42.480 --> 23:44.060
See if there's some kind of condition.

23:44.390 --> 23:46.789
Yeah, also look into
her military history.

23:46.790 --> 23:49.569
See if she's had any contact
with chemical weapons

23:49.570 --> 23:52.509
while she was on tour that might've
altered her brain chemistry.

23:52.510 --> 23:53.799
Yeah, that might be the case,

23:53.800 --> 23:55.220
but the fact is:

23:55.600 --> 23:57.989
Toby, your reads aren't
exactly helping us right now.

23:57.990 --> 23:59.659
If anything, I think they're
getting in the way.

23:59.660 --> 24:02.110
Where's the evidence to back
all this up, hm?

24:02.790 --> 24:04.650
And if Carlie did do it, why?

24:05.100 --> 24:07.439
Why'd she go to all the trouble
of finding her birth father

24:07.440 --> 24:08.640
and then just kill him?

24:08.650 --> 24:11.119
Maybe Fin wanted nothing
to do with her, you know?

24:11.120 --> 24:12.829
She was upset and wanted revenge.

24:12.830 --> 24:16.360
Maybe she snapped.
She just returned from the tour of duty,

24:16.380 --> 24:19.309
her adoptive parents died year
ago in a tragic car accident.

24:19.310 --> 24:21.460
She could be suffering from PTSD.

24:21.630 --> 24:24.219
It's common for someone
suffering from mental distress

24:24.220 --> 24:25.860
to construct an alternate reality.

24:27.280 --> 24:28.320
I'm gonna keep working.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.879
Maybe that's why Toby's reads
have been so confusing.

24:30.880 --> 24:31.529
It's a lot of "maybes",

24:31.530 --> 24:33.360
we're grasping at straws here, guys.

24:33.370 --> 24:35.429
Get me some evidence,
I'll bring her back in.

24:35.430 --> 24:37.990
Till then, I gotta let her go.

24:40.620 --> 24:42.679
Look, I know my reads are a
bit confusing right now,

24:42.680 --> 24:43.710
I get it but...

24:43.770 --> 24:46.739
There's just too many coincidences
for her not to be connected.

24:46.740 --> 24:48.399
I read Grant and I see her

24:48.400 --> 24:49.640
and Natalie ID's her.

24:49.650 --> 24:51.820
Yeah, she ends up being Fin's daughter.

24:51.830 --> 24:53.770
Yeah, you're right.
There's too many connections here,

24:53.780 --> 24:56.619
they all point to her. But, I guess...

24:56.620 --> 24:58.080
- Evidence.
- Yeah.

25:07.040 --> 25:09.119
I don't know Oz...
It's hard not to question

25:09.120 --> 25:10.870
what I'm getting in
the reads right now.

25:11.610 --> 25:13.299
- Maybe it's me.
- No, it's not you.

25:13.300 --> 25:15.970
- It's gotta be her, come on.
- Maybe I'm losing my touch.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.749
OK, here. I'll prove it to you.
 Read me.

25:17.750 --> 25:18.909
- No, it's OK, it's OK.
- No, no, no. Come on, read me.

25:18.910 --> 25:20.540
I love when you do it. Read me!

25:23.280 --> 25:24.929
You're being ridiculous.
Your power's just fine.

25:24.930 --> 25:27.330
Also, you got some ketchup
on your chin.

25:28.250 --> 25:29.549
- See, I told you!
- Pretty good.

25:29.550 --> 25:30.680
- See, you're good!
- OK.

25:30.690 --> 25:32.824
Maybe I need to be more specific.

25:32.854 --> 25:33.862
- Right?
- Sure.

25:33.910 --> 25:35.720
Just, think about your day.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.670
What happened, who'd you see?

25:37.920 --> 25:40.090
I'd rather not actually...

25:41.500 --> 25:43.490
I don't think that's a good idea.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.139
You want my advice?
You want to know about

25:45.140 --> 25:47.590
Toby's past?
Ask Toby.

25:49.030 --> 25:52.009
You saw Tia?
Ask me about what?

25:52.010 --> 25:53.029
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:53.030 --> 25:54.399
OK? But look, your power's
in tip-top shape,

25:54.400 --> 25:56.010
- so that's good. Back to work.
- No no.

25:56.090 --> 25:58.547
Was she asking about
my mother again?

26:00.010 --> 26:02.239
- I don't want to get involved.
- I can't believe that

26:02.240 --> 26:04.359
she's still asking about this.
I told her to stop.

26:04.360 --> 26:06.289
- Her heart is in the right place.
- That's not the point.

26:06.290 --> 26:07.809
She's just looking out for you, bud.

26:07.810 --> 26:08.749
Well whose side are you on?

26:08.750 --> 26:10.650
I'm not on anybody's side.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.199
This is why I don't get involved
in family issues.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.849
'Cause it gets messy and I
don't want any part of it.

26:14.850 --> 26:16.160
I'm out, starting now.

26:17.310 --> 26:21.000
Sorry, OK? Just, I've got a
lot on my plate right now.

26:21.010 --> 26:22.520
OK, so focus on the case.

26:22.790 --> 26:24.389
Alright? Clearly your
mind is in tip top shape

26:24.390 --> 26:26.609
so it's this woman
who's screwing with you

26:26.610 --> 26:27.780
and figure out why.

26:29.640 --> 26:31.100
- Would you like some dessert?
- Yes.

26:32.620 --> 26:33.819
Yeah. That's it.

26:33.820 --> 26:36.220
Great, send it over. OK, thanks.

26:36.990 --> 26:38.329
- Think we got him.
- Who?

26:38.330 --> 26:41.069
That was the IRS.
The numbered account that

26:41.070 --> 26:45.209
- Topher sent that 60 grand belongs to...
- Ben Rigands.

26:45.210 --> 26:47.759
He's kind of a concierge
to the uber rich.

26:47.760 --> 26:49.049
What kind of concierge?

26:49.050 --> 26:50.899
The kind that can get
the rich and famous

26:50.900 --> 26:52.069
whatever they need.

26:52.070 --> 26:53.449
He's a kind of a connector.

26:53.450 --> 26:56.179
You know, illegal substances,
escorts, etcetera.

26:56.180 --> 26:58.279
- Contract killers?
- Possibly.

26:58.280 --> 27:01.197
- We've got to get Topher back in here.
- Yeah.

27:04.250 --> 27:06.190
So how do you know Ben Rigands?

27:06.280 --> 27:07.470
Never seen him before.

27:08.010 --> 27:09.589
How did they find him?

27:09.590 --> 27:12.880
You transferred 60 grand to him.
What was it for?

27:12.960 --> 27:14.920
I already told you, I don't remember.

27:16.380 --> 27:18.600
I want him taken out.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.499
Well we have a team apprehending
him as we speak,

27:23.500 --> 27:25.980
so you can either tell us
what you hired him for

27:26.310 --> 27:28.710
or you can let him make his
own statement.

27:30.710 --> 27:33.040
This isn't how I wanted it to come out.

27:33.070 --> 27:34.219
What to come out?

27:34.220 --> 27:36.529
Rigands. Yes, I paid him the money,

27:36.530 --> 27:38.189
but it was a business transaction

27:38.190 --> 27:40.319
for services rendered, that's all.

27:40.320 --> 27:42.360
And what were those services, exactly?

27:42.710 --> 27:46.150
- I can't say.
- Did you hire him to kill your brother?

27:46.190 --> 27:48.690
No. Of course not.

27:49.840 --> 27:51.779
Fin and I had our issues.

27:51.780 --> 27:54.610
He may have treated me like
garbage my whole life,

27:54.770 --> 27:57.260
but kill him?
God.

27:57.400 --> 28:01.280
No. Never. He was my family,
my brother.

28:01.520 --> 28:04.689
Never had to do a thing.
Someone else hated him more than me.

28:09.130 --> 28:10.790
So what? Is he playing us?

28:10.800 --> 28:12.749
Actually, it looks like
he's telling the truth.

28:12.750 --> 28:14.429
Using the minimum ping
RTT measurements,

28:14.430 --> 28:17.199
I was finally able to geolocate
the specified target host.

28:17.200 --> 28:18.860
Woah, woah. English.

28:20.100 --> 28:22.669
I know who owns
the secure VOIP phone.

28:22.670 --> 28:26.750
The one that Rigands was putting
Topher in touch with was...

28:28.080 --> 28:31.039
Francois Gilles.
A brilliant businessman,

28:31.040 --> 28:32.919
a prolific investor,
this guy's up there with Buffet,

28:32.920 --> 28:34.629
icon, i mean, the best.

28:34.630 --> 28:35.899
What does he have to do with this?

28:35.900 --> 28:38.870
Well, I made a few calls
and it seems like Topher,

28:39.080 --> 28:40.640
in collusion with ben rigands,

28:40.650 --> 28:42.119
has been making discrete plays

28:42.120 --> 28:45.199
to shareholders trying to convince
them to sell to Francois.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.919
So he was trying to sell the
family business from under Fin?

28:47.920 --> 28:51.610
Yeah, he orchestrates a
hostile takeover in exchange

28:51.660 --> 28:53.959
for taking Fin out and
making way for Topher.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.520
"Take Fin out."
That's what Topher was talking about.

28:57.050 --> 28:58.599
So he wasn't trying
to kill his brother?

28:58.600 --> 28:59.649
No, he was just trying to get his brother

28:59.650 --> 29:01.160
pushed out of the company.

29:01.400 --> 29:02.700
We gotta get back to Carlie.

29:03.020 --> 29:04.739
- With what?
- We know she's been lying to us.

29:04.740 --> 29:06.639
Natalie Gall, Grant Evans
have ID'd her.

29:06.640 --> 29:07.890
It's not enough.

29:08.080 --> 29:09.659
Then we keep questioning her.
Like you said,

29:09.660 --> 29:10.730
she's gotta have a breaking point.

29:10.740 --> 29:11.949
I agree. Toby, I do.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.410
But there's no way becker is going
to allow us to bring her back

29:14.540 --> 29:17.070
in without supporting evidence.
I'm sorry.

29:33.540 --> 29:34.998
Carlie?

29:35.640 --> 29:36.630
Carlie.

29:38.690 --> 29:40.910
Hey, I just want to ask you
a few more questions.

29:42.390 --> 29:44.049
Of course. Yeah, sure.

29:44.050 --> 29:46.619
Great, good. I was just hoping
you could walk me through

29:46.620 --> 29:48.149
what you did on the night
of Fin's murder.

29:48.150 --> 29:50.184
Where you were,
who you were with.

29:50.553 --> 29:52.319
Well, I thought that we already
went through all of this.

29:52.320 --> 29:54.910
We did, but there was a few
holes in your time-line.

29:57.040 --> 29:59.820
OK. I was at home for most of the day

29:59.830 --> 30:01.479
and I had a job interview at night.

30:01.480 --> 30:02.980
Oh yeah, what time was that?

30:03.190 --> 30:05.531
Around... 10:00 pm?

30:05.561 --> 30:08.550
Mm-hmm. And the first time that
you heard of Fin Nightingale,

30:08.570 --> 30:09.279
when was that?

30:09.280 --> 30:12.190
- The next morning on the news.
- Thought that was in the paper.

30:13.000 --> 30:16.270
- Yeah it was in the paper.
- OK.

30:16.620 --> 30:18.079
And you weren't aware
that he was your father

30:18.080 --> 30:19.500
until the interrogation with us?

30:19.510 --> 30:21.250
Yeah, exactly.
I was...

30:22.520 --> 30:23.649
Don't walk away from me!

30:23.650 --> 30:25.870
- I need you to get out of my house.
- You are my father!

30:25.880 --> 30:28.199
Look. I can't be, OK?
I never had a daughter.

30:28.200 --> 30:31.130
- Grant, get in here!
- I can find my own way out.

30:35.410 --> 30:37.330
Did you ever meet your
uncle Topher Nightingale?

30:38.160 --> 30:40.460
Look, no. I don't know any of them.

30:40.900 --> 30:42.650
I don't want to know any of them.

30:42.750 --> 30:45.069
My own father and mother
never cared about me.

30:45.070 --> 30:46.230
Gave me up.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.779
What about your mother?
Aren't you curious to find her?

30:49.780 --> 30:51.380
No. I... no.

30:57.070 --> 30:58.730
What are you doing here?

31:00.320 --> 31:01.509
It's not going to make me
change my mind.

31:01.510 --> 31:03.290
I told you we're done.

31:03.300 --> 31:04.610
But I'm your daughter.

31:12.010 --> 31:14.790
OK, um. Why don't we go down
to the IIB

31:14.800 --> 31:16.330
and put all this on the record?

31:17.590 --> 31:18.379
Yeah, sure.

31:18.380 --> 31:20.000
- Car's just over here.
- OK, yeah.

31:21.560 --> 31:23.339
Help me! Help me!
He's attacking me!

31:23.340 --> 31:25.546
Hey buddy, is there a problem?

31:29.050 --> 31:31.830
I'm a cop! IIB, OK?!

31:44.870 --> 31:46.029
So Carlie killed Fin.

31:46.030 --> 31:48.369
She finally broke and I was able
to see what really happened.

31:48.370 --> 31:50.660
I guess no one can keep up a
charade like that forever.

31:50.780 --> 31:51.999
What kind of car
did she drive off in?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.039
A Burgundy beater, I didn't
get a license plate.

31:54.040 --> 31:56.019
She doesn't have a car,
as far as I can tell.

31:56.020 --> 31:56.890
It may have been stolen.

31:57.140 --> 31:59.120
I'll check to see if any
thefts have been reported.

31:59.170 --> 32:01.249
Also check surveillance
cameras in the area.

32:01.250 --> 32:02.349
We got an APB out on her,

32:02.350 --> 32:03.750
but she's got a pretty good head start.

32:04.130 --> 32:05.120
Where's she going?

32:05.170 --> 32:07.459
She's desperate.
She knows time is running out.

32:07.460 --> 32:08.609
You know, when I read her,

32:08.610 --> 32:10.519
she said something about
how her mother and father

32:10.520 --> 32:11.479
never really cared.

32:11.480 --> 32:13.059
If she killed Fin because
she felt abandoned,

32:13.060 --> 32:15.379
what's to stop her from
finding her mother?

32:15.380 --> 32:17.720
Well, the PI said that she never
found her mother.

32:17.790 --> 32:18.469
No, she didn't.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.019
But now that we know
where the father is,

32:20.020 --> 32:21.339
maybe we can find the mother.

32:21.340 --> 32:23.120
And probably so can Carlie.

32:23.460 --> 32:24.150
Right.

32:26.400 --> 32:28.389
OK. Fin was 42,

32:28.390 --> 32:29.649
that means he was 16

32:29.650 --> 32:30.860
when Carlie was conceived.

32:30.880 --> 32:31.630
He was in high school.

32:31.640 --> 32:34.039
He went to one of those
posh Private schools.

32:34.040 --> 32:35.489
What about Topher and the butler?

32:35.490 --> 32:36.899
They know who the mother is?

32:36.900 --> 32:38.129
They both claim to have no knowledge

32:38.130 --> 32:39.780
of Fin ever fathering a child.

32:40.450 --> 32:42.259
If we can get a list of every girl

32:42.260 --> 32:43.900
that went to Fin's school at that time,

32:44.360 --> 32:46.480
we may be able to find her
by process of elimination.

32:46.820 --> 32:48.700
- Let's start making calls.
- Let's go.

32:51.990 --> 32:55.119
Hello, hi. Uh, this is Dev Clark...

32:55.120 --> 32:56.930
No, no, no. No, no. Fin Nightingale.

32:57.510 --> 32:58.380
OK.

32:58.390 --> 33:00.759
Hi, this is Dev Clark with
the IIB, I'm calling...

33:00.760 --> 33:02.559
Hi, is this Brenda de Teran?

33:02.560 --> 33:04.359
This is Toby Logan with the IIB.

33:04.360 --> 33:05.819
OK, thank you for your time.

33:05.820 --> 33:07.270
Alright, thank you for your help.

33:07.900 --> 33:08.970
Yep, thanks.

33:12.280 --> 33:14.100
Well, we're almost through
Fin's entire class,

33:14.110 --> 33:15.900
plus a grade on either side.

33:16.360 --> 33:17.399
He could've met the girl anywhere.

33:17.400 --> 33:19.500
We should be looking
at other schools, Michelle.

33:22.810 --> 33:23.889
Thank you.

33:24.640 --> 33:26.210
Guys, I think I got something.

33:26.970 --> 33:30.290
OK. Victoria Marx.

33:30.660 --> 33:32.530
She's in the year behind Fin.

33:32.966 --> 33:34.649
Looks like she left halfway
through her grade 10 year

33:34.650 --> 33:36.799
to go to a finishing school
in Paris, France.

33:36.829 --> 33:38.470
Now, I've got a diploma,

33:38.490 --> 33:40.430
I've got flight logs to and from Paris.

33:40.440 --> 33:41.939
For all intents and purposes,
she was there.

33:41.940 --> 33:43.360
I sense a "but" coming on.

33:43.520 --> 33:45.890
Well, I spoke to her teachers
and her classmates.

33:45.910 --> 33:49.599
No one, not one person,
remembers her at that school.

33:49.900 --> 33:52.009
- It was a cover.
- Yeah, very expensive cover.

33:52.010 --> 33:54.874
She paid to go to a fancy
finishing school in Paris, France,

33:54.904 --> 33:55.779
but didn't attend.

33:55.780 --> 33:56.990
Do we have an address?

33:57.020 --> 33:59.561
Alright, we've gotta get
to her before Carlie does.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.189
So, what is this all about exactly?

34:07.190 --> 34:09.489
I'm pulled from my home,
told practically nothing.

34:10.766 --> 34:13.520
Uh, Fin Nightingale
was killed a few days ago.

34:15.070 --> 34:18.119
I heard. But what does
that have to do with me?

34:18.120 --> 34:20.020
I haven't seen him in years.

34:23.320 --> 34:24.699
Do you recognize her?

34:26.569 --> 34:28.483
Could it be?

34:29.260 --> 34:30.259
We believe that this woman,

34:30.260 --> 34:32.889
Carlie Hutton, was involved
in his death.

34:33.440 --> 34:35.179
Is this your daughter,
Ms. Marx?

34:38.719 --> 34:41.420
You have to understand. I was...

34:42.732 --> 34:46.610
So young. Young and in love.

34:47.340 --> 34:52.248
And... when my mother
found out I was pregnant,

34:52.250 --> 34:54.358
she made my decision for me.

34:55.000 --> 34:56.859
So she took you out
of school for the year

34:56.860 --> 34:58.710
and made it look like
you were in France?

34:59.250 --> 35:01.700
She did. But I never left the country.

35:01.960 --> 35:03.910
Wait, so your mother
handled the adoption?

35:04.390 --> 35:06.290
Well, she tried to involve Fin's mother,

35:06.420 --> 35:08.960
but Mrs. Nightingale would
have nothing to do with it.

35:09.890 --> 35:11.099
From my understanding,

35:11.100 --> 35:14.330
there was a very large payment
to keep my family quiet.

35:14.370 --> 35:17.310
- And Fin never knew?
- No, he didn't.

35:17.870 --> 35:20.159
The only information that we have
from the adoption papers

35:20.160 --> 35:23.930
is the name York and the address
for one of the gale stores.

35:25.100 --> 35:27.449
- York?
- Fin's mother's maiden name.

35:27.450 --> 35:30.550
That's how the PI and
ultimately Carlie found Fin.

35:31.940 --> 35:33.780
Sounds like something
my mother would do.

35:33.990 --> 35:36.020
She was always one
to hold a grudge.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.569
The reason that we brought
you here is because

35:39.570 --> 35:41.180
we fear that you may be in danger.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.570
That she may be coming after you next.

35:45.640 --> 35:48.930
She must be so hurt
to be that vengeful.

35:50.530 --> 35:53.910
I tried looking for them for years.
I just...

35:54.010 --> 35:57.180
- I had to give up eventually.
- I'm sorry. Them?

35:58.380 --> 36:01.410
You didn't know?
I had twins.

36:07.700 --> 36:11.570
Let's meet Margot Gates.
This is Carlie's twin.

36:12.340 --> 36:15.110
I was able to subpoena the files
from the adoption agency

36:15.160 --> 36:17.199
and identify the family
that she was placed with.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.929
She lives in upstate New York,

36:18.930 --> 36:21.839
she travelled from foster
home to foster home,

36:21.840 --> 36:24.259
she's all of her life
been sort of a drifter.

36:24.260 --> 36:26.300
Yeah, I knew a lot of kids
like that growing up.

36:26.950 --> 36:28.410
I almost ended up one of them.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.320
So, could Margot be our killer?

36:32.080 --> 36:34.289
That would explain why
your reads of Carlie

36:34.290 --> 36:37.120
- haven't made any sense.
- So if Carlie didn't kill Fin,

36:37.520 --> 36:39.840
the woman I saw in the
parking lot was Margot?

36:40.020 --> 36:41.970
So what was she doing at
Carlie's apartment building?

36:42.490 --> 36:44.790
- They in this thing together?
- Is Carlie still missing?

36:45.160 --> 36:48.339
We have a unit looking but uh,
there's no sightings as of yet.

36:48.340 --> 36:50.249
Yeah, right before I saw
Margot in the parking lot,

36:50.250 --> 36:51.609
I heard her trunk slam shut.

36:51.610 --> 36:53.220
What if Carlie's not on the run?

36:53.350 --> 36:54.730
What if Margot took her?

36:54.930 --> 36:55.549
Know what?

36:55.550 --> 36:57.569
Let me check what kind
of phone Margot has,

36:57.570 --> 36:59.220
maybe we can get a GPS signal on.

36:59.870 --> 37:01.580
Why would she kidnap Carlie?

37:02.100 --> 37:03.349
Well, it's been all over the news

37:03.350 --> 37:05.450
since it broke that she was Fin's heir.

37:07.260 --> 37:08.380
OK, here it is.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.288
Oh, you're not going to believe this.

37:12.680 --> 37:14.370
Nightingale residence.

37:14.400 --> 37:16.249
Well, she never intended
to go after the mother.

37:16.250 --> 37:18.949
Maybe she's trying to wipe out
the entire Nightingale lineage.

37:18.950 --> 37:22.090
First Fin, then Carlie, now Topher.

37:22.230 --> 37:24.309
The entire nightingale
trust would go to her.

37:24.310 --> 37:25.390
Yeah, let's go.

37:39.410 --> 37:41.173
She killed Topher.

37:41.447 --> 37:45.601
Ah! Agh! Ah!

37:46.540 --> 37:48.460
Drop the gun. Now.

37:48.880 --> 37:50.499
Please! Help me! Help me!

37:50.500 --> 37:52.560
I didn't do this.
I swear.

37:52.760 --> 37:53.831
Hey, let me see. Let me see.

37:53.861 --> 37:56.550
First she killed Topher,
and she shot me!

37:56.590 --> 37:58.220
I didn't shoot her!
She's lying!

37:58.700 --> 38:00.576
She's setting me up!

38:00.606 --> 38:01.860
Wait, what happened, Carlie?

38:02.240 --> 38:03.389
She brought me here,

38:03.419 --> 38:04.264
said there wasn't enough money

38:04.294 --> 38:06.113
- to go around.
- She's lying.

38:07.740 --> 38:10.420
You're my sister.
You're the one who killed Fin.

38:10.450 --> 38:12.854
Get in the trunk, now.

38:15.695 --> 38:17.097
Go!

38:21.586 --> 38:24.960
Why did you do this?
Are you trying to set up Carlie?

38:25.436 --> 38:27.026
She shot me!

38:32.831 --> 38:34.130
Why are you doing this?

38:34.140 --> 38:36.630
Because for once, I'm
taking what I'm owed.

38:38.010 --> 38:40.619
No. You shot yourself.
She shot herself!

38:40.620 --> 38:42.999
No, I didn't, it was her!
She killed our father!

38:43.000 --> 38:46.040
No, this is over.
You killed Fin, didn't you?

38:46.400 --> 38:49.046
No, wait! Wait!
Please. Please.

38:49.076 --> 38:50.687
You have to understand.

38:50.717 --> 38:53.183
Just, let me....

38:53.602 --> 38:54.942
OK.

38:56.861 --> 38:59.160
OK. I didn't plan any of this.

39:00.700 --> 39:02.619
I didn't need him to want me.

39:02.620 --> 39:03.881
Fin?

39:04.190 --> 39:07.110
He just had to give me the cash
and I would've shut up.

39:07.410 --> 39:09.980
OK? Nobody needed to know
that he had a daughter.

39:10.550 --> 39:12.439
Nobody. I could've just
walked away

39:12.440 --> 39:14.669
but he treated me like
I was nothing.

39:14.670 --> 39:16.705
So you set up Carlie?

39:18.610 --> 39:20.450
Well, I saw her on the news
and I thought that...

39:21.860 --> 39:23.910
Finally the world had
given me a break.

39:24.531 --> 39:25.847
A way out.

39:26.910 --> 39:29.022
I knew what I had to do,
I didn't have a choice.

39:29.052 --> 39:31.119
There's always a choice.
I'm going to call this in.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.747
No. Not with me.

39:32.777 --> 39:35.719
Dev, I need you to send
an ambulance to the Nightingale residence.

39:35.720 --> 39:37.229
I guess I should've known.

39:37.230 --> 39:39.460
People like me, we don't
have happy endings.

39:39.630 --> 39:41.740
Hey. I'm your sister.

39:42.710 --> 39:45.320
Your family.
I could've helped you.

39:45.504 --> 39:47.436
Alright, thanks man.

39:47.466 --> 39:49.937
I guess we'll never know now, will we?

39:52.630 --> 39:54.359
You're under arrest for the murder of

39:54.360 --> 39:56.249
Fin and Topher Nightingale.

39:56.580 --> 39:58.068
It's my duty to inform you

39:58.098 --> 40:00.170
that you have the right
to retain and instruct

40:00.205 --> 40:03.503
counsel of your choice in
private and without delay.

41:31.110 --> 41:32.647
Where you been?

41:33.228 --> 41:34.640
Oh, oh...

41:34.670 --> 41:38.360
New story. Following a lead,
it turned out to be...

41:38.370 --> 41:40.140
- Tia?
- Dead end.

41:41.686 --> 41:43.362
Transparent?

41:45.060 --> 41:48.074
Looking into my mother
only leads to dead ends.

41:48.104 --> 41:51.230
I know but... how can somebody just
disappear into thin air like that?

41:51.260 --> 41:53.607
I mean, I've followed every
lead, I've called any...

41:53.637 --> 41:55.898
Look, when I told you not
to look into it, I mean it.

41:55.928 --> 41:58.049
- I know, but Toby...
- The last time

41:58.079 --> 42:00.044
she was in my life,
people got hurt, Tia.

42:00.074 --> 42:01.641
Toby, I'm not afraid.

42:01.671 --> 42:03.299
And I'm not a case.
I'm not a story,

42:03.300 --> 42:05.006
don't be a reporter.

42:05.240 --> 42:07.129
I don't want to lose you.

42:08.120 --> 42:10.460
OK... I didn't...

42:11.265 --> 42:12.130
I know.

42:12.160 --> 42:14.480
I didn't want to open up
something that would hurt you...

42:14.510 --> 42:17.580
You have to believe that
I'm comfortable with my past.

42:17.700 --> 42:19.220
I made peace with it.

42:19.730 --> 42:24.032
I'm interested in you
and the future we have together.

42:26.850 --> 42:28.354
Case closed?

42:29.678 --> 42:31.470
