THAT'S WHAT THEM GOVERNMENT
PEOPLE DO BEST--MAKE MISTAKES.

11:15.968 --> 11:17.345
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:17.511 --> 11:20.139
THANK YOU,
MRS. EDWARDS.

11:30.983 --> 11:32.276
GOOD DAY, MR. MAKAY.

11:32.443 --> 11:33.694
WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT IT?

11:33.861 --> 11:36.280
WELL, THE SUN IS SHINING,
IT'S NOT TOO HOT,

11:36.447 --> 11:38.699
AND TOMORROW WE START
CUTTING YOUR ORDER.

11:38.866 --> 11:41.911
MY ORDER. YOU MEAN THE
ORDER FOR THE BARN LUMBER?

11:42.078 --> 11:43.329
JA.

11:43.496 --> 11:45.331
WELL, YOU CAN
FORGET ABOUT THAT.

11:45.498 --> 11:47.375
YOU CAN CANCEL
ME ORDER NOW.

11:47.541 --> 11:49.668
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU SAID--

11:49.835 --> 11:54.298
I KNOW WHAT I SAID, BUT THEY
JUST TOOK ALL MY MONEY--

11:54.465 --> 11:56.717
ALL OF IT!

12:07.686 --> 12:08.854
THERE YOU GO.

12:09.021 --> 12:10.689
SURE GOT A BOW
IN IT.

12:10.856 --> 12:14.151
YEAH. A LITTLE HEAT AND A
SLEDGE WILL TAKE CARE OF THAT.

12:14.318 --> 12:15.569
NO HURRY.

12:15.736 --> 12:16.862
WHAT?

12:17.029 --> 12:18.864
NO HURRY
TO GET IT FIXED.

12:19.031 --> 12:20.491
I GOT TO
SHUT DOWN ANYHOW.

12:20.658 --> 12:22.493
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

12:22.660 --> 12:24.537
ALL MY ORDERS
WERE CANCELED.

12:24.703 --> 12:26.622
HERE'S YOUR BAD NEWS.

12:29.083 --> 12:30.626
COUNTY CLERK.

12:30.793 --> 12:32.628
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

12:34.463 --> 12:37.383
DOUBLED MY PROPERTY TAX
PLUS A ROAD ASSESSMENT.

12:37.550 --> 12:39.844
I WONDER IF THEY'VE
DONE THAT TO ME?

12:40.010 --> 12:42.346
I IMAGINE EVERYBODY
IN THE TOWNSHIP.

12:42.513 --> 12:44.306
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MAKING
A PROFIT THIS YEAR

12:44.473 --> 12:45.766
AND JUST ABOUT
BREAKING EVEN.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.726
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH
THEM GOVERNMENT PEOPLE?

12:47.893 --> 12:50.896
DON'T THEY KNOW A MAN CAN'T
MAKE A LIVING LIKE THAT?

12:51.063 --> 12:53.399
I DON'T THINK
THEY CARE.

12:53.566 --> 12:56.235
SO NO HURRY
FINISHING WITH THAT.

13:01.449 --> 13:03.868
BUILDING NEW ROADS, WHAT WAS
WRONG WITH THE OLD ROADS?

13:04.034 --> 13:05.244
THEY WERE FINE.

13:05.411 --> 13:06.745
WHO TOLD THEM THAT WE
NEEDED ALL THEM NEW ROADS?

13:06.912 --> 13:07.955
NONE OF US.

13:08.122 --> 13:09.331
CHARLES.
CAN I HELP YOU?

13:09.498 --> 13:10.583
YEAH, I'D LIKE
SOME SUGAR.

13:10.749 --> 13:12.710
LET ME ASK
YOU SOMETHING--

13:12.877 --> 13:14.295
WHO SAID WE NEEDED ALL
THEM FANCY TURNPIKES?

13:14.462 --> 13:16.338
I'VE NEVER SEEN THE
POST OFFICE SO CROWDED.

13:16.505 --> 13:17.756
BUT WHO VOTED
FOR IT?

13:17.923 --> 13:19.884
NOT THE FARMER THAT THEY'RE
TAXING TO PAY FOR IT.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.260
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE WAY
THEY'RE TAXING US, INGALLS?

13:21.427 --> 13:22.761
HURTS, NO DOUBT
ABOUT THAT.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.263
THEY'VE MORE THAN
DOUBLED MY TAXES.

13:24.430 --> 13:25.639
IT SAYS IN THE PAPER
THAT WE CAN PROTEST.

13:25.806 --> 13:27.183
AND I THINK WE OUGHT TO.

13:27.349 --> 13:28.601
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT A PROTEST,

13:28.767 --> 13:29.935
I JUST DON'T THINK
lT'LL DO ANY GOOD.

13:30.102 --> 13:31.270
WE ALL OUGHT TO
MARCH OVER THERE TO

13:31.437 --> 13:32.813
REDWOOD FALLS AND TELL
THEM NO-NOTHING'S

13:32.980 --> 13:34.773
WHERE THEY'RE HEADING.
THAT'S WHAT I THINK.

13:34.940 --> 13:37.067
I'M SURE THAT
THOSE NO-NOTHINGS

13:37.234 --> 13:39.737
AS YOU CALL THEM,
MR. MAKAY,

13:39.904 --> 13:41.739
KNOW A GOOD DEAL MORE
ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING

13:41.906 --> 13:43.324
THAN A LOT OF PEOPLE
WHO STAND AROUND

13:43.491 --> 13:47.578
WEEPING AND WAILING BECAUSE
THEY GOT WHAT THEY VOTED FOR.

13:47.745 --> 13:49.997
[GASPS]
NELS!

13:50.164 --> 13:51.874
THIS IS FROM THE OFFICE
OF THE COUNTY CLERK.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.627
WHY, THIS IS HIGHWAY ROBBERY!

13:56.212 --> 13:57.213
WELL...

13:57.379 --> 14:00.382
GAVE THAT SETH PAULEY
A PIECE OF MY MIND.

14:00.549 --> 14:02.343
DID THE WHOLE THING WITHOUT
LEAVING HIS OFFICE.

14:02.510 --> 14:04.470
I RESENT THAT,
AND I TOLD HIM SO.

14:04.637 --> 14:06.931
SETH PAULEY?
WHICH ONE IS HE?

14:07.097 --> 14:10.226
HE'S THE COUNTY CLERK, THE MAN
WHO JUST DOUBLED MY TAXES.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.978
TAXATION WITHOUT
REPRESENTATION, HUH, PA?

14:13.145 --> 14:14.396
WELL, NOT QUITE,
HALF PINT.

14:14.563 --> 14:15.648
WE'VE GOT
REPRESENTATIVES.

14:15.814 --> 14:18.108
THE TROUBLE IS,
WE NEVER SEE THEM.

14:18.275 --> 14:20.486
COUNTY ASSESSOR
WAS HERE.

14:20.653 --> 14:22.321
YOU CAN GET THE
VINEGAR NOW, LAURA.

14:22.488 --> 14:23.489
WHAT?

14:23.656 --> 14:24.740
WHEN YOU WERE
AT THE MILL.

14:24.907 --> 14:26.325
REMEMBER?
I TOLD YOU.

14:26.492 --> 14:27.826
WELL, I REMEMBER
YOU TOLD ME,

14:27.993 --> 14:29.286
BUT HE WAS ONLY HERE
FOR 10 MINUTES.

14:29.453 --> 14:31.830
I THOUGHT HE WAS JUST HAND
SHAKING TO GET VOTES.

14:31.997 --> 14:33.958
CHARLES, DO YOU THINK
THAT'S BLUE ENOUGH?

14:34.124 --> 14:35.376
Charles: FOR WHAT?

14:35.543 --> 14:36.835
THE FLAG.

14:37.002 --> 14:39.922
THE STARS
GO ON THE BLUE.

14:40.089 --> 14:42.841
YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

14:43.008 --> 14:45.344
WE HAD 9 CENTS IN OUR
SCHOOL COLLECTION.

14:45.511 --> 14:47.388
MRS. WHIPPLE WOULDN'T
TAKE ANY MONEY.

14:47.555 --> 14:49.807
SHE SAID THE CLOTH
WAS HER DONATION

14:49.974 --> 14:51.350
TO THE CENTENNIAL
PICNIC.

14:51.517 --> 14:54.603
I DOUBT VERY MUCH THAT THERE'S
GOING TO BE A PICNIC.

14:57.147 --> 14:58.691
NO PICNIC AT ALL?

14:58.857 --> 15:01.485
I DON'T THINK THE PEOPLE ARE
IN THE MOOD FOR A PICNIC.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.532
SOME OF THE KIDS SAID THAT
THEIR FOLKS WOULDN'T COME.

15:06.699 --> 15:08.409
WELL, CAN'T SAY
AS I BLAME THEM.

15:08.576 --> 15:10.494
I DON'T FEEL MUCH
LIKE CELEBRATING, MYSELF.

15:10.661 --> 15:12.538
I'M GOING TO GO
FOR A WALK.

15:18.586 --> 15:21.505
MARY'S FLAG
IS HALF DONE.

15:21.672 --> 15:24.133
MORE THAN HALF.

15:25.551 --> 15:29.805
YES, AND IT'S GOING
TO BE BEAUTIFUL!

16:01.837 --> 16:03.672
WILL YOU PLEASE
HURRY UP?

16:03.839 --> 16:06.383
I'M TRYING TO THINK
OF WHAT TO SAY.

16:06.550 --> 16:08.093
WHEN YOU SAY
YOUR PRAYERS,

16:08.260 --> 16:11.680
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO ASK FOR
ANYTHING FOR YOURSELF, ARE YOU?

16:11.847 --> 16:13.932
YOU'RE NOT
SUPPOSED TO, NO.

16:14.099 --> 16:17.269
LIKE IF I ASKED THAT PA GOT
OVER BEING MAD AT AMERICA

16:17.436 --> 16:18.604
AND HE'D CHANGE
HIS MIND

16:18.771 --> 16:20.689
ABOUT TAKING US TO THE
CENTENNIAL PICNIC.

16:20.856 --> 16:24.109
THAT WOULD BE ASKING FOR SOMETHING
FOR ME AND YOU, WOULDN'T IT?

16:24.276 --> 16:26.111
YES, IT WOULD.
COME TO BED.

16:26.278 --> 16:27.404
IF YOU PUT IT
IN YOUR PRAYERS,

16:27.571 --> 16:29.573
IT WOULD BE THE SAME
THING, WOULDN'T IT?

16:29.740 --> 16:31.450
OF COURSE.

16:31.617 --> 16:32.993
WELL, THEN,
HOW DO WE DO IT?

16:33.160 --> 16:34.370
HOW DO WE DO WHAT?

16:34.536 --> 16:37.164
PUT IT IN OUR PRAYERS THAT
PA WILL BE HAPPY AGAIN

16:37.331 --> 16:38.957
AND TAKE US TO THE
CENTENNIAL PICNIC.

16:39.124 --> 16:43.337
I REALLY THINK THE LORD HAS MORE
IMPORTANT THINGS TO THINK ABOUT.

16:43.504 --> 16:46.131
WELL, HE MARKS THE
FALL OF EVERY SPARROW.

16:46.298 --> 16:48.384
ISN'T THAT WHAT REVEREND
ALDEN ALWAYS SAYS?

16:48.550 --> 16:51.970
I THINK SO.
PLEASE COME TO BED.

16:52.137 --> 16:54.223
IF HE CAN WORRY
ABOUT SPARROWS,

16:54.390 --> 16:56.183
HE CAN WORRY
ABOUT PEOPLE.

16:56.350 --> 16:59.311
AND I WON'T ASK
FOR ANYTHING FOR ME.

16:59.478 --> 17:00.979
JUST HURRY UP.

17:05.859 --> 17:08.487
AND BLESS
OUR WHOLE FAMILY,

17:08.654 --> 17:13.992
AND ESPECIALLY MAKE PA HAPPY AGAIN
AND NOT MAD AT AMERICA. AMEN.

17:19.665 --> 17:24.253
I DIDN'T HAVE TO ASK. IF
PA ISN'T MAD AT AMERICA,

17:24.420 --> 17:25.796
HE'LL CELEBRATE
THE CENTENNIAL,

17:25.963 --> 17:29.341
AND HE'LL SURE TAKE US
TO THAT PICNIC.

17:29.508 --> 17:31.009
GOOD NIGHT!

17:41.895 --> 17:44.690
WOMEN MARVEL AT THE STUNNING
ARRAY OF SEWING MACHINES,

17:44.857 --> 17:46.442
WHILE THE YOUNGSTERS
ARE MUCH TAKEN BY

17:46.608 --> 17:49.528
THE SEVERAL NEW-FANGLED
SODA FOUNTAINS.

17:49.695 --> 17:51.947
THERE WERE ALSO COUNTLESS
EXOTIC DISPLAYS

17:52.114 --> 17:53.449
FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES:

17:53.615 --> 17:55.534
STUFFED CROCODILES
FROM EGYPT,

17:55.701 --> 17:56.869
BEEHIVES FROM ENGLAND,

17:57.035 --> 17:59.621
AND A MODEL PAGODA
FROM CHINA.

17:59.788 --> 18:02.291
NOW, I'M SURE YOU ALL
KNOW WHAT A CROCODILE IS

18:02.458 --> 18:04.001
AND A BEEHIVE,

18:04.168 --> 18:07.504
BUT WHO CAN TELL ME
WHAT A PAGODA IS?

18:10.424 --> 18:11.467
LAURA?

18:11.633 --> 18:12.760
IT'S A BOAT.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.386
WRONG.

18:14.553 --> 18:15.554
WILLIE?

18:15.721 --> 18:17.264
IT'S ONE OF THEM
FUNNY HATS.

18:17.431 --> 18:18.474
[LAUGHS]
WRONG AGAIN.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.310
A PAGODA IS
A CHINESE TEMPLE.

18:21.477 --> 18:23.562
A PLACE OF WORSHIP.

18:23.729 --> 18:24.855
WELL, I'LL READ
MORE ABOUT

18:25.022 --> 18:27.191
THE PHILADELPHIA
CENTENNIAL TOMORROW.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.526
IN THE MEANTIME, I THINK WE
SHOULD GET BACK TO WORK.

18:29.693 --> 18:30.778
MISS BEADLE?

18:30.944 --> 18:32.029
YES, MARY?

18:32.196 --> 18:33.614
OUR PA SAID THERE MIGHT NOT
BE ANY TOWN PICNIC.

18:33.781 --> 18:34.865
AT RECESS, SOME OF
THE KIDS SAID

18:35.032 --> 18:36.408
THEIR FOLKS
DIDN'T WANT ONE.

18:36.575 --> 18:39.578
OUR PA SAID HE WOULDN'T
GO EVEN IF THERE WAS ONE.

18:39.745 --> 18:41.622
MY PA'S MAD AT
THOSE TAXERS.

18:41.789 --> 18:43.916
HE WON'T GO AND
HE WON'T LET US GO.

18:44.082 --> 18:48.212
WELL, I'M VERY SORRY
TO HEAR THAT.

18:48.378 --> 18:50.506
YES, VIKTOR?

18:50.672 --> 18:53.759
MY FATHER'S MAKING
THE FLAGPOLE.

18:53.926 --> 18:56.011
WELL, THERE YOU ARE.

18:56.178 --> 18:57.304
WE'LL HAVE A FLAGPOLE

18:57.471 --> 18:59.973
AND MARY'S MAKING
A FLAG.

19:00.140 --> 19:03.060
THE CENTENNIAL IS PART OF
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY.

19:03.227 --> 19:04.436
WHY, WE COULD HAVE
THE CELEBRATION

19:04.603 --> 19:05.771
RIGHT HERE IN
THE SCHOOLROOM.

19:05.938 --> 19:07.439
ALL IN FAVOR SAY "AYE."

19:07.606 --> 19:08.982
All: AYE!

19:14.154 --> 19:15.614
HELLO, CHARLES!

19:15.781 --> 19:17.282
HEY, EDWARDS!

19:17.449 --> 19:19.618
YOU'RE GETTING
CAUGHT UP, ARE YOU?

19:19.785 --> 19:21.578
YEAH, A LITTLE BIT.

19:21.745 --> 19:23.121
WHAT BRINGS YOU
OUT HERE?

19:23.288 --> 19:24.665
OH, WELL, EVER SINCE
THE MILL SHUT DOWN,

19:24.832 --> 19:26.208
I'VE BEEN RUNNING
GOVERNMENT ERRANDS.

19:26.375 --> 19:29.002
NO PAY, BUT IT GETS ME IN
GOOD WITH THE POSTMASTER.

19:29.169 --> 19:31.255
HERE. SHE SAID
GIVE THIS TO YOU.

19:31.421 --> 19:32.589
MY LETTER TO THE COUNTY CLERK--

19:32.756 --> 19:33.882
HOW COME SHE DIDN'T POST IT?

19:34.049 --> 19:35.384
THERE WASN'T
NO NEED.

19:35.551 --> 19:36.802
THERE'S GOING TO BE A MAN
IN SCHOOL ALL DAY TOMORROW

19:36.969 --> 19:38.011
LISTENING TO PROTESTS.

19:38.178 --> 19:39.263
OH, YEAH?
I'LL BE THERE.

19:39.429 --> 19:40.556
YEAH, ME, TOO.
BETTER GET THERE EARLY.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.224
I THINK THERE'S GOING
TO BE A BIG CROWD.

19:42.391 --> 19:44.268
I CAN'T STAND AROUND
HERE ALL DAY JAWING.

19:44.434 --> 19:45.727
GOVERNMENT BUSINESS.
SEE YOU LATER.

19:45.894 --> 19:48.313
ALL RIGHT. WE'LL
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

20:03.412 --> 20:04.705
Mr. Edwards:
MORNING, CHARLES.

20:04.872 --> 20:06.456
EDWARDS.

20:06.623 --> 20:07.833
THOUGHT YOU WENT
TO REDWOOD FALLS.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.501
HE DID. HE WAS
JUST TELLING ME ABOUT IT.

20:09.668 --> 20:11.837
TWICE. THE COUNTY CLERK--HE
TOO BUSY TO SEE ME.

20:12.004 --> 20:13.046
OH.

20:13.213 --> 20:14.339
THOSE LONG TRIPS
FOR NOTHING.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.133
MAYBE TODAY.
MAYBE.

20:16.300 --> 20:17.551
I TOLD YOU
TO GET HERE EARLY.

20:17.718 --> 20:20.012
I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN MY OWN ADVICE.
SEE YOU LATER.

20:20.178 --> 20:21.555
GOOD LUCK.

20:21.722 --> 20:23.599
I SAW HIM WHEN HE
FIRST CAME TO TOWN,

20:23.765 --> 20:25.809
ALL GUSSIED UP
LIKE A CIRCUS HORSE.

20:25.976 --> 20:27.561
GOT TO BE
THE COUNTY CLERK.

20:27.728 --> 20:29.813
NO, HE'S DEPUTY CLERK.
HIS NAME IS SNELL.

20:29.980 --> 20:31.189
SNELL?

20:31.356 --> 20:32.482
JA.

20:32.649 --> 20:35.944
THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
EATING ME CABBAGE PLANTS.

20:39.865 --> 20:42.618
YOU, SIR,
COME IN.

20:47.247 --> 20:48.582
DID YOU HEAR
YULI SAY

20:48.749 --> 20:50.918
THE COUNTY CLERK WAS
TOO BUSY TO SEE HIM?

20:51.084 --> 20:52.628
JA, I HEARD.

20:52.794 --> 20:53.879
PICKING THE POCKETS
OF THE POOR--

20:54.046 --> 20:55.797
THAT'S WHY
HE WAS TOO BUSY.

20:55.964 --> 20:58.634
THEM POLITICIANS
ARE ALL ALIKE.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.761
DO YOU KNOW WHAT
WE PAY THE GOVERNOR?

21:00.928 --> 21:02.471
5,000.

21:02.638 --> 21:05.933
$5,000 A YEAR
FOR DOING NOTHING.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.352
SAYS 7 YEARS' TAXES?

21:08.518 --> 21:09.645
THAT'S RIGHT.

21:09.811 --> 21:10.812
THAT'S WRONG.

21:10.979 --> 21:13.523
I ONLY BUY THE LAND
THIS YEAR.

21:13.690 --> 21:14.775
WELL, I UNDERSTAND THAT,

21:14.942 --> 21:16.652
BUT WHEN YOU
BUY LAND,

21:16.818 --> 21:20.072
YOU ASSUME THE TAX LIABILITY.

21:20.238 --> 21:23.033
ASSUME LIABIL--WHAT?

GOT HARD TIMES NOW,

39:33.664 --> 39:34.874
BUT DID YOU KNOW
THAT WAY BACK,

39:35.041 --> 39:36.751
BEFORE THE DECLARATION
OF INDEPENDENCE WAS SIGNED,

39:36.917 --> 39:38.794
THINGS WERE
A WHOLE LOT WORSE?

39:38.961 --> 39:41.547
BRITISH SOLDIERS MARCHED
INTO YOUR HOUSE AND STAYED.

39:41.714 --> 39:43.466
AND YOU HAD TO FEED THEM
AND EVERYTHING.

39:43.632 --> 39:45.134
IT SEEMS TO ME
I'VE READ THAT.

39:45.301 --> 39:46.802
Laura: AND AFTER THE
DECLARATION WAS SIGNED,

39:46.969 --> 39:48.345
THEY HAD TO FIGHT
A BIG WAR.

39:49.847 --> 39:52.266
RIGHT FROM THE FIRST,
THERE'S SCARCELY BEEN A TIME

WHEN AMERICA DIDN'T HAVE
SOME SORT OF TROUBLE.

GENERAL WASHINGTON HAD A LOT
AT VALLEY FORGE.

39:55.686 --> 39:57.229
THAT'S TRUE, PA.

39:57.396 --> 40:00.691

JUST ABOUT TORE OUR COUNTRY APART,

EVERY TIME WE CAME THROUGH.

40:03.819 --> 40:07.573
EVERY TIME OUR COUNTRY JUST GOT
BIGGER AND STRONGER AND BETTER.

40:07.740 --> 40:10.743

CELEBRATE THE CENTENNIAL.

YOU EXPLAIN IT TO ME

40:15.206 --> 40:16.999

YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:18.667 --> 40:19.835

A NICE PICNIC LUNCH.
