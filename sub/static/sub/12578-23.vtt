Okey-dokey
.

00:34.034 --> 00:37.537
Now, we'll be
with dale and nanc
y at chef ling's.

00:37.537 --> 00:38.988
I don't know the numbe
r

00:39.489 --> 00:42.492
but if there's any problem
, just penetrate
the gribbles' perimeter.

00:42.492 --> 00:44.494
The alarm company
will page them.

00:44.494 --> 00:45.995
I don't need a baby-sitter.

00:45.995 --> 00:48.498
Bobby, luanne is not here
to baby-sit.

00:48.498 --> 00:50.500
She is here
because she misses you

00:50.500 --> 00:52.502
and she wants to
spend time with you.

00:52.502 --> 00:54.170
No, no, no, i...

00:57.424 --> 00:58.925
[doorbell rings]

00:58.925 --> 01:01.428
You'll get the other half
when we get back.

01:01.428 --> 01:02.729
(hank)
My turn.

01:02.729 --> 01:03.596
[Door clicking]

01:03.596 --> 01:05.598
Uh, change of plans.

01:05.598 --> 01:08.184
The reservations
fell through.

01:08.184 --> 01:09.686
We're gonna eat
in the alley tonight.

01:09.686 --> 01:11.688
The bowling alley!

01:12.105 --> 01:14.023
What? Oh, no.
I don't think...

01:14.023 --> 01:15.525
i am not
much of a bowler.

01:15.942 --> 01:18.445
This shirt
would beg to differ.

01:18.445 --> 01:20.447
Look at yours, hank.

01:20.447 --> 01:22.449
"Flamer"
for the propane man.

01:22.449 --> 01:23.450
[Chuckling]

01:23.450 --> 01:25.869
I guess i could have gone
with "propane man."

01:25.869 --> 01:27.704
No. No. Flamer is cooler.

01:28.121 --> 01:31.124
Look at yours, sug'.
It says, "spare peg."

01:31.124 --> 01:34.627
I started with "square peg"
and then i gave it a twist.

01:34.627 --> 01:37.130
And then nancy said
"spare" was a bowling term.

01:37.130 --> 01:39.048
So it works
on both levels.

01:40.550 --> 01:42.802
All right.
This was very thoughtful,

01:42.802 --> 01:44.387
but, really,
i'm not much of a bowler.

01:44.387 --> 01:47.390
Maybe we could, uh,
wear them to the movies, or...

01:47.390 --> 01:48.391
come on, peggy.

01:48.892 --> 01:50.894
The gribbles are
gonna think
you don't like 'em.

01:50.894 --> 01:52.395
He's right, peggy.

01:52.395 --> 01:54.898
What do you have
against my wife?

01:59.369 --> 02:00.120
(hank)
Men's 12.

02:00.453 --> 02:01.287

Ladies' 5, sug'.

02:05.625 --> 02:08.127
Gent's 9, gal size 5.

02:09.128 --> 02:11.080
[Pins clattering]

02:11.414 --> 02:12.415
(man)
Uh, ma'am?

02:12.415 --> 02:14.334
Hmm?

02:14.834 --> 02:16.636
The man needs to know
your shoe size.

02:17.003 --> 02:19.005
I'm sure he does.
And i will tell it to him.

02:19.506 --> 02:21.007
Why don't you go
pick your shoes up,

02:21.007 --> 02:23.009
and i will be
with you shortly.

02:26.679 --> 02:27.680
[Hissing]

02:29.182 --> 02:31.017
Shoe size, ma'am.

02:31.017 --> 02:33.520
Look, i am willing to pay
your shoe-rental fee.

02:33.520 --> 02:36.906
But i would like to bowl
in my own shoes, please.

02:36.906 --> 02:38.908
I'm sorry,
but those aren't
bowling shoes.

02:38.908 --> 02:41.077
I can't let you
on the lanes.

02:41.077 --> 02:43.746
Come on, peggy. We're puttin'
our nicknames up
on the screen.

02:43.746 --> 02:45.248
It's a lot of fun.

02:45.748 --> 02:48.501
.
I am a size 16

02:48.501 --> 02:52.088
oh, i'm sorry.
I thought you said size 16.

02:52.589 --> 02:53.673
I did.

02:53.673 --> 02:55.425
Oh, my god!

02:55.425 --> 02:57.677
No one's ever asked
for those before.

03:08.104 --> 03:10.473
.
Just give me a few minutes

03:10.473 --> 03:13.476
all right, hank,
i'm just gonna
go check on bobby.

03:13.476 --> 03:14.477
[Slams]

03:23.453 --> 03:26.573
But, mommy,
i want my mary janes.

03:26.573 --> 03:30.577
Oh, peggy, it's not my fault
your feet are growing
and you're not.

03:30.577 --> 03:32.462
I found something
that can fit her.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.413
[Gasping]

03:33.413 --> 03:34.914
Nurse's shoes?

03:35.331 --> 03:36.833
[Young peggy sobbing]

03:39.752 --> 03:41.754
Hey, watch your feet.

03:42.255 --> 03:43.256
[Gasps]

03:47.010 --> 03:50.313
I'm looking for something
in a woman's size 16
bowling shoe

03:50.313 --> 03:51.814
that says "8" on the back.

03:51.814 --> 03:52.815
[Chuckling]

03:52.815 --> 03:55.318
No, i think you're looking
for a size 16-and-a-half

03:55.318 --> 03:56.603
that says "8"
on the back.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.489
16 and a half? No.

03:59.489 --> 04:03.243
No, no. I have been a size 16
since i was
just a little girl.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.611
Oh, it's actually quite common

04:05.111 --> 04:07.280
for a woman's feet
to keep growing
as she gets older.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.782
They're getting bigger?
Oh, god!

04:09.782 --> 04:12.869
Yeah. At this rate i'd say
you've got a shot
at the big 2-o.

04:12.869 --> 04:13.953
[Gasping]

04:20.510 --> 04:21.377
[Crying]

04:21.377 --> 04:25.381
Hello? Hello?
It's ok.

04:25.381 --> 04:26.683
It really is.

04:26.683 --> 04:30.637
.
Oh, please!
Spare me your psychobabble

04:30.637 --> 04:32.055
[continues crying]

04:32.055 --> 04:34.557
I know exactly
how you feel.

04:36.225 --> 04:38.027
[Whirring]

04:44.367 --> 04:46.869
Honey, there's a man
you should talk to.

04:46.869 --> 04:49.122
He can make you feel good
about your feet.

04:49.122 --> 04:51.708
I don't hide mine anymore.

04:51.708 --> 04:52.825
Huh?

04:52.825 --> 04:54.994
(peggy)
Grant trimble?

04:54.994 --> 04:56.496
(trimble)
Again.

04:56.496 --> 04:57.997
One more time.

04:58.998 --> 05:00.633
Have you ever had
back problems?

05:00.633 --> 05:01.918
No.

05:01.918 --> 05:04.637
Of course not.
I'll bet you're
a gifted athlete.

05:04.637 --> 05:08.141
Well, i am one of the best
softball pitchers
in the tri-towns.

05:08.141 --> 05:11.978
That's because you have
really, really amazing feet.

05:11.978 --> 05:13.980
They're long enoug
h to give you
a perfect stride

05:13.980 --> 05:16.482
and wide enough
to root you firmly
on the ground.

05:16.482 --> 05:19.352
I don't even have to ask
if you're
a professional success.

05:19.352 --> 05:22.855
I have 3-peated
the substitute-teacher
of the year award

05:22.855 --> 05:24.691
at tom landry middle school.

05:24.691 --> 05:27.327
I would have been surprise
d if you'd said otherwise.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.829
Wait. Are you saying
that i owe my success

05:29.829 --> 05:32.448
to the fact
that my feet are so big?

05:32.448 --> 05:34.450
.
Some might see them as big

05:34.951 --> 05:37.954
i see them
as vibrant and alive.

05:37.954 --> 05:38.955
[Chuckles]

05:39.455 --> 05:41.874
They're also very hot.

05:41.874 --> 05:44.877
Well, no one has ever
told me that before,

05:45.378 --> 05:46.379
about my feet.

05:46.379 --> 05:49.549
I have heard that before
about my eyes and my teeth.

05:49.549 --> 05:53.603
Peggy, how would you like
to help others
in your situation?

05:53.603 --> 05:56.105
We're making a small
inspirational film.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.892
It's for all those people
out there who have
foot issues.

05:59.892 --> 06:01.277
We need to take them
to a place

06:01.277 --> 06:04.364
where they can feel better
about themselves.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.948
Would you...

06:05.948 --> 06:07.700
could you appear in it?

06:07.700 --> 06:11.537
Mr. Trimble,
i've... i've never let my feet
be photographed before. I...

06:11.537 --> 06:12.872
please, peggy.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.825
You have an exceptional gift.

06:15.825 --> 06:19.545
Wouldn't it be wrong of you
not to share it
with the world?

06:21.547 --> 06:24.050
I can see how it might be.
Yes.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.807
Oh, yeah.

06:30.807 --> 06:33.226
Wonderful work, peggy.
Thank you.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.595
Now go over there
and walk in some mud.

06:35.595 --> 06:38.231
It's spa-grade,
i assure you.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.515
[Sizzling]

06:40.817 --> 06:42.318
[Car door shuts]

06:43.820 --> 06:45.822
Guess what i did today.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.324
Worked up an appetite
for steak, i hope.

06:48.324 --> 06:51.327
Yep. I starred
in a short film.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.329
.
Hold on. Let me just...

06:54.831 --> 06:56.833
ok. So, tell me about it.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.837
Well, i was discovered
in a parking lot,
just like lana turner.

07:00.837 --> 07:04.340
And now i'm gonna star
in an educational video,

07:04.340 --> 07:06.759
which lana turner
was never asked to do.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.429
.
That's great.
I'll get to see
my wife in a movie

07:09.429 --> 07:12.432
actually, it's not
really me in the film.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.434
I-it's mainly my feet.

07:14.434 --> 07:16.936
Well, everyone has to
start somewhere.
What's it about?

07:17.437 --> 07:21.224
It is an empowerment video
for people in
the foot community.

07:21.224 --> 07:23.643
(peggy)
Oh, the director,
who is a genius,

07:23.643 --> 07:25.645
filmed me
getting a foot massage

07:25.645 --> 07:27.146
and soaking my feet in butter,

07:27.647 --> 07:29.649
stimulating my soles
with a ping pong paddle.

07:29.649 --> 07:32.652
Hank, he may even
distribute it
on the internet.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.153
(hank)
The internet?

07:34.654 --> 07:37.156
Well, tell me, does a big
movie star like you

07:37.156 --> 07:39.158
still like her steaks
medium-rare?

07:39.659 --> 07:41.744
[Hank humming]

07:41.744 --> 07:43.246
[Scraping]

07:44.747 --> 07:46.499
[Clearing throat]

07:46.499 --> 07:49.252
Hank, i got somethin'
you should take a look at.

07:49.252 --> 07:52.255
And you might wanna bring
a valid credit card with ya.

07:52.255 --> 07:53.756
[Bill chuckles]

07:55.091 --> 07:57.009
All right, what's so funny?

07:57.510 --> 08:00.513
If it's that
tweety bird made of x's,
i've already seen it.

08:00.513 --> 08:04.433
Hank, welcome to
peggysfeet. Com.

08:04.433 --> 08:05.985
(hank)
Wait a minute.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.987
Is that
a pornographic web site?

08:07.987 --> 08:10.490
I-it's not
a pornographic web site.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.492
It's a fetish web site.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.494
And those are
peggy's feet.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.745
Well, those aren't...
now...

08:16.028 --> 08:17.530
(male announcer)
You've got feet.

08:17.530 --> 08:19.832
(peggy)
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

08:20.116 --> 08:21.117
What the heck is that?

08:21.617 --> 08:22.502
Ping pong paddle.

08:22.502 --> 08:26.455
[Chuckling]
Peggy's been a bad, bad girl.

08:26.455 --> 08:30.376
(peggy)
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

08:30.376 --> 08:33.763
Oh, my god!

08:38.851 --> 08:43.940
(peggy)
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.442
Dang it, dale,
turn that thing off!

08:46.442 --> 08:48.945
Just testin'
my new sound card.

08:48.945 --> 08:51.948
I tell you what, man.
It all... all startin'
to make sense, man,

08:51.948 --> 08:54.750
how you can afford
that old shop vac, man.

08:55.251 --> 08:56.752
[Sighing]
For god's sakes, boomhauer!

08:57.253 --> 08:58.754
You've known peggy
longer than i have.

08:59.255 --> 09:01.757
She respects herself
and hates her feet too much

09:01.757 --> 09:03.759
to ever show up
on somethin' like this.

09:04.176 --> 09:06.178
Shh, here comes
the fondue.

09:06.178 --> 09:07.680
(hank)
No, it doesn't.

09:07.680 --> 09:08.681
[Exclaims]

09:11.767 --> 09:14.854
(peggy)
And so, i have finally taken
my own advice

09:14.854 --> 09:17.356
to combine
my love of education

09:17.356 --> 09:19.191
with my interest
in edutainment.

09:19.609 --> 09:22.478
But why are they
only makin' videos
of your feet?

09:22.478 --> 09:23.980
.
Very good question

09:23.980 --> 09:26.482
you may not have noticed
because i wear
bold eyeglasses

09:26.482 --> 09:28.484
to draw the attention
to my head.

09:28.484 --> 09:31.871
But your mother ha
s exceptionally long
and handsome feet.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.072
[Bubbling]

09:33.456 --> 09:34.457
Oh.

09:34.457 --> 09:37.460
And up until now
i had been tricked
by the media

09:37.460 --> 09:39.962
into thinking
that they were
unattractive.

09:39.962 --> 09:42.965
Who?
Who in the media
tricked you?

09:44.467 --> 09:46.469
Bobby,
i don't know their names.

09:46.469 --> 09:48.220
It's more of a conspiracy.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.806
Well, hey,
there's my movie star.

09:50.806 --> 09:52.642
[Laughs]

09:52.642 --> 09:55.895
Uh, bobby,
can you go watch tv?

09:55.895 --> 09:57.647
Can i!

09:57.647 --> 10:01.517
So, uh, peggy,
if i wanted to
shake the hand

10:01.517 --> 10:04.770
of the directo
r of this, uh...

10:04.770 --> 10:08.941
uh, where would i go
to wait for him, uh,
to shake his hand?

10:08.941 --> 10:12.528
Director, writer, cameraman,
grant trimble does it all.

10:12.528 --> 10:15.531
He has his own
motion picture warehouse
out by the truck scales.

10:15.531 --> 10:16.782
.
I'll be right back

10:17.667 --> 10:19.035
[brakes squealing]

10:21.170 --> 10:22.505
[Car door shuts]

10:25.625 --> 10:27.460
[Dog barking]

10:27.877 --> 10:29.128
Are you the tickler?

10:29.128 --> 10:30.129
Uh, no.

10:32.381 --> 10:34.767
Hello? Hello? Anyone there?

10:36.802 --> 10:38.270
Hello? Trimble?

10:38.771 --> 10:39.605
Trimble!

10:39.605 --> 10:41.607

Trimble,
i want you to stay away
from my wife.

10:46.028 --> 10:48.030
Oh, and who's your wife?

10:48.030 --> 10:50.032
(hank)
Mrs. Peggy hill.

10:50.032 --> 10:52.034
Then you're a very lucky man.

10:52.034 --> 10:54.036
But i'm afraid
we're gonna have to share.

10:54.036 --> 10:57.039
You, sir, are nothing
but a low-rent smut hound

10:57.039 --> 11:00.042
and you're gonna delete
my wife's feet
from your internet

11:00.042 --> 11:02.795
before she finds out
what you've done with them.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.296
What i've done
with them?

11:04.296 --> 11:05.798
I've made them stars.

11:05.798 --> 11:08.467
You made them
wade through pork and beans!

11:08.884 --> 11:11.387
This isn't about
individual artistic decisions.

11:11.387 --> 11:14.890
It's about somethin'
bigger than you, or me
, or any of us.

11:15.391 --> 11:17.393
.
It's about
a world wired together

11:17.893 --> 11:20.012
a future where,
at the click of a mouse,

11:20.012 --> 11:22.014
a dream can start in arlen

11:22.014 --> 11:25.017
and end on a computer
in johannesburg.

11:25.017 --> 11:27.019
The generations
joined, united

11:27.520 --> 11:30.272

of a single ideal:

11:30.272 --> 11:33.275
Women's big, beautiful feet.

11:33.275 --> 11:36.779
It's about an end to strif
e and misunderstanding.

11:36.779 --> 11:41.333
One world,
one dream, one peace.

You leave me with no choice.

11:43.836 --> 11:46.205

Uh, peggy, there's somethin'
i wanna show you
on your computer.

12:09.145 --> 12:12.648
This is an internet site
called peggysfeet. Com.

12:13.115 --> 12:15.117
Well, i think
that is wonderful.

12:15.117 --> 12:18.621
Now women who are
too embarrassed to even
go to the doctor

12:18.621 --> 12:22.625
can be inspired by my feet
in the privacy
of their own homes.

12:22.625 --> 12:25.628
Peggy, your feet are
stepping on raw hamburger.

12:25.628 --> 12:28.047
Umm-hmm. Yes.
Mr. Trimble says that

12:28.047 --> 12:29.882
that is a common european
beauty treatment.

12:30.216 --> 12:33.302
[Sighing]
Here's some honey
being poured all over 'em.

12:33.302 --> 12:35.054
It... it tones
the pores.

12:35.054 --> 12:38.841
Yeah,
and now a bunch of flies
get stuck to 'em.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.259
Ok. Now, that was a mistake.

12:40.259 --> 12:44.013
Uh, here's where you
can buy the flies.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.015
They're selling the flies?

12:46.015 --> 12:48.517
Well, i'm... i'm sure
the money goes to

12:48.517 --> 12:50.519
important
foot-related charities.

12:50.519 --> 12:53.522
Uh, your socks
are for sale, too.

12:53.522 --> 12:56.025

Peggy, they're
foot-fetish videos

12:56.525 --> 12:58.194

of college girls

13:24.019 --> 13:27.022
Oh, peggy,
what a terrific surprise!

13:27.022 --> 13:28.774
I hope you brought
your swim trunks.

13:28.774 --> 13:30.726
I am not here
to swim, trimble.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.228
I know what you're up to.

13:32.228 --> 13:35.231
I have it
on good authority,
my own,

13:35.231 --> 13:39.034
that you have been
exploiting my feet
for unseemly purposes.

13:39.034 --> 13:40.786
You have a computer.

13:40.786 --> 13:43.956
.
Yes.
I also have a moral compas
s that always points to good

13:44.373 --> 13:46.876
all right, peggy.
I understand
you're a little annoyed.

13:46.876 --> 13:49.378
We were shooting for
the women's-empowerment
market.

13:49.378 --> 13:53.916
But as it turns out,
women were not
as interested as we'd hoped.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.418
We did, however,
find an audience.

13:56.919 --> 13:57.670
And it was men.

13:58.003 --> 13:58.921
Oh.

13:58.921 --> 14:02.424
I was ready to pull the plug
on peggysfeet. Com.

14:02.925 --> 14:05.060
But then i realized something.

14:05.060 --> 14:06.679
Yes?

14:06.679 --> 14:09.849
Have you ever seen
a pair of big, beautiful feet
like yours

14:10.182 --> 14:11.517
in playboymagazine, peggy?

14:12.017 --> 14:13.519
No, not on the cover.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.520
And i certainly
wouldn't open it

14:15.020 --> 14:17.022
because i do not
read pornography.

14:17.439 --> 14:21.110
Let's use a gap ad.
Have you ever seen them
in a gap ad? Ever?

14:21.110 --> 14:23.696
No.
That's right. You haven't.

14:24.196 --> 14:26.916
But what if someone,
alone at first,

14:26.916 --> 14:30.920
was out there appreciating
big, beautiful feet?

14:30.920 --> 14:33.923
I mean, loving them,
the way they deserve.

14:33.923 --> 14:36.926
Pretty soon you'd see them
in music videos.

14:36.926 --> 14:38.627
Then hollywood movies.

14:38.627 --> 14:40.129
And before too long,

14:40.129 --> 14:44.466
on 60-foot billboards
across america,
pushing parker pens.

14:44.466 --> 14:46.969
So, really,
what you're saying is,

14:46.969 --> 14:50.973
i will be helping create
a better world
for men and women?

14:51.974 --> 14:53.976
I'd be like rosa parks.

14:53.976 --> 14:56.612
This web site is
your bus, peggy.

14:57.029 --> 14:58.781
Ride it to freedom.

15:00.983 --> 15:04.203
But you said the movies
were just for women.

15:04.203 --> 15:06.205
Well, honey,
ultimately they are.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.707
But first
we must reach the men.

15:08.707 --> 15:11.710
All right.
How can i put this
so you'll understand?

15:11.710 --> 15:12.711
Hmm.

15:13.212 --> 15:15.714
Bobby, some men
like ladies' bottoms.

15:16.215 --> 15:18.217
And other men
like ladies' bosoms.

15:18.217 --> 15:20.753
And a small, small number,

15:20.753 --> 15:23.756
too few,
love ladies' big feet.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.059
Now, mommy is trying
to increase that number

15:27.426 --> 15:30.229
and thus
help women everywhere.

15:30.229 --> 15:32.932
How does this
help the women
with the big boobies?

15:32.932 --> 15:34.850
They don't need
any more help.

15:36.318 --> 15:38.821

to my book club.

the hunt for red october

15:40.823 --> 15:43.659
which, luckily,
i read 12 years ago.

15:43.659 --> 15:46.662
That's why you haven't seen me
reading it recently. Ok?

15:46.662 --> 15:48.664
I will be
at becky bankey's house.

or a cell phone,
or a telegraph.

15:58.590 --> 16:01.126
Oh, yeah. Cut.

16:01.126 --> 16:03.796
Now let's rinse you off
and move on to
some more eggs.

16:03.796 --> 16:06.799
More eggs?
But we've done so many eggs.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.802
How about if my feet
are on a silken cushion?

16:09.802 --> 16:11.770
I see you have one.

16:11.770 --> 16:13.772
That could be good
. but wait.

16:13.772 --> 16:16.859
H-how about if your feet
are next to
a rotting jack-o'-lantern?

16:16.859 --> 16:19.311
You know, sort of
a beauty and the beastthing.

16:19.311 --> 16:22.398
Well, i've always thought
i should play beauty.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.700

And you will. Inner beauty

Still hot.

16:34.326 --> 16:36.712
?
That'll burn your feet
. are you ready for that

16:36.712 --> 16:41.216
what? No.
That's for you, to drink.

16:41.216 --> 16:45.054
I did have an idea, though,
which is why
i brought the flowers.

16:45.054 --> 16:46.638
Uh-huh?

16:46.638 --> 16:50.309
?
How about surrounding
my beautiful feet
with beautiful flowers

16:50.809 --> 16:52.728
i figured we did
beauty and the beast.

16:52.728 --> 16:57.232
How about
"beauty finally
meets her match"?

16:57.232 --> 17:01.020
Uh, flowers smell good.
That's not gonna work.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.022
What's wrong
with smelling good?

17:03.022 --> 17:04.573

that smell good.

We'll compromise
with a tub
of corned beef hash.

No, grant.
That's just more food.

17:11.329 --> 17:14.333

s from my own yard.
They're so pretty...

look, i've been
around this business

17:16.001 --> 17:18.002
for long enough
to know what works.

17:18.002 --> 17:19.003
No one wants pretty.

17:19.003 --> 17:22.508
They want spinach, eggs,
and corned beef hash.

17:22.508 --> 17:25.210
For some reason,
they don't like them together.
Go figure.

17:25.210 --> 17:27.212
Well, of course
they want pretty.

17:27.212 --> 17:29.214

those big, ugly feet of yours

could buy you a fur coat.

only like my feet

That's what i've been
trying to tell you.
They're fetishists.

That means they obsess
on one weird little thing.

as much as they do.

part of the package.

those really big tires.

i want a new truck.

is for you to smash them

and then reset them

about empowerment?
It was all lies.

i was making smush videos.

for my ugly feet.

You never made me
feel bad about it.

And just because
there's some people
in the world

21:03.745 --> 21:07.249
who want me
to feel bad about it,
doesn't mean i have to.
