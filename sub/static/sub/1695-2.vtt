- This morning.

02:35.906 --> 02:37.692
It's fresh in the pot.

02:38.825 --> 02:39.986
Out hunting.

02:40.077 --> 02:41.988
He's too old to hunt.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.404
Pretty much blind. Can't even smell.

- Didn't recognize me.
- He's senile.

- What about it?

03:15.612 --> 03:18.320
He was born in 1862.

03:18.407 --> 03:19.989
No, he wasn't.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.066
He was.

03:22.160 --> 03:25.278
He never wanted Mother
to know how much older he was.

- Hmm.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.669
he took me aside.

Said I shouldn't wait as long as he did

03:37.718 --> 03:39.959

How much did he offer?

16:48.090 --> 16:50.707
One thousand

16:50.801 --> 16:52.178
for each of you.

16:52.929 --> 16:55.421
I'll beat that.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.256
Easy.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.305
If that's what this is about.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.473
Cash you out...

17:06.233 --> 17:07.770
...right now.

17:09.819 --> 17:10.901
(GROANS)

17:28.089 --> 17:29.796
Do you have any family?

17:29.966 --> 17:33.584
Put the bullet in.
That's what Carl is paying you for, isn't it?

17:38.516 --> 17:40.883
I asked you a question.

17:42.353 --> 17:43.889
(GASPING)

17:46.941 --> 17:49.524
Wife, two girls.

18:11.048 --> 18:14.586
When you see your children tonight,

18:14.677 --> 18:16.964
remember,

18:17.054 --> 18:19.386
it didn't cost you anything.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.205
NUCKY: I'm on the sleeper Thursday morning.

18:54.342 --> 18:56.333
- Anything along the way...
- Just enjoy the trip.

18:56.427 --> 18:58.839
...telegram or call McCoy.

18:58.929 --> 19:00.055
Tom has the number.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.800
Bill's in clover down there, huh?

19:01.891 --> 19:03.302
NUCKYI We'll see.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.508
And, uh,
I'll bring something back for the kids.

19:05.603 --> 19:07.890
A bag of oranges might be nice.

19:08.022 --> 19:09.137
That's a lot to carry around.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.848
About time. I'm all out of small talk.

19:11.942 --> 19:13.398
They understand this needs to be quick?

19:13.486 --> 19:14.976
He shouldn't even be here.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.403
Let's keep everybody happy.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.315
Fred.

19:25.039 --> 19:28.122
I guess we'd both
prefer a private booth at the Knife & Fork.

19:28.209 --> 19:29.620
I'll take it on the way back.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.919
I am behind closed doors
in DC tomorrow night.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.463
- What's that about?
-(SCOFFS)

19:35.549 --> 19:38.587
Mellon and Coolidge
moving the chess pieces around again.

19:38.678 --> 19:41.295
- Don't give either of them my regards.
- I won't.

19:43.391 --> 19:45.678
He wants to get off on the right foot

19:45.768 --> 19:49.932
and make sure you know
he's aware of how things work.

19:50.022 --> 19:52.104
Then let's have him tell me.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.474
You can come over.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.733
Mr. Thompson.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.693
You'd probably rather I didn't...

20:05.371 --> 20:07.282
My name is Warren Knox, sir.

20:07.373 --> 20:09.205
I don't know
if you're aware that my predecessor...

20:09.291 --> 20:11.248
- He's aware, son.
- Oh.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.876
Good.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.920
Well, not good.

20:16.006 --> 20:18.794
Actually, it was terrible.

20:18.884 --> 20:21.876
Sacrifice in the line of duty.

20:21.971 --> 20:23.336
Yes.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.262
That's...

20:26.684 --> 20:28.925
Anyway, I just wanted to tell you,

20:29.019 --> 20:31.397
man-to-man, that as the new head

20:31.480 --> 20:33.733
of the Prohibition
Enforcement in Atlantic City,

20:33.816 --> 20:36.979
I do intend to take my duties
with the utmost seriousness

20:37.361 --> 20:41.150
and enforce the existing laws
to the very best of my abilities.

20:44.160 --> 20:46.527
- What?
- That was a joke.

20:46.620 --> 20:50.033
I was joking.
I thought you might all appreciate that.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.240
Where are you from?

20:52.334 --> 20:54.166
Me? I'm from Iowa.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.869
Where in Iowa?

20:55.963 --> 20:57.795
- Atkins.
- Where is that?

20:57.882 --> 21:01.216
It's approximately 14 miles from
Cedar Rapids, depending on the route.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.175
This is how we're going to proceed.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.220
Any concerns you have,
any needs you want addressed,

21:06.307 --> 21:08.173
you'll deal with this man.

21:08.350 --> 21:11.763
- Your brother?
- But you and I, we're not going to meet again.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.845
That's how the system works.

21:13.939 --> 21:16.226
I think you'll find it's a useful arrangement.

21:17.568 --> 21:20.026
Any part of what I just said not clear to you?

21:20.112 --> 21:23.230
No, sir. You were really succinct.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.402
Then we're done.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.991
SIGRID: Step there.

21:28.078 --> 21:30.410
Careful now.

21:30.498 --> 21:31.954
I don't like surprises.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.373
Hush and quiet.

21:38.714 --> 21:41.046
Now open.

21:43.302 --> 21:46.215
- What's this?
- It is the Davenport.

21:46.931 --> 21:48.092
Oh, my-

21:48.182 --> 21:50.139
Yes, it is the best one.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.050
Has anyone sat on it?

21:52.144 --> 21:53.600
You will be the first.

21:53.687 --> 21:56.645
You sit in our home after you work so hard.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.357
We have chairs.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.855
This is more proper.

22:01.946 --> 22:06.110
And there is a credenza
and table which is new coming Friday.

22:06.242 --> 22:09.200
Cedar chest and bed of maple.

22:09.787 --> 22:11.027
(SIGHS)

22:11.705 --> 22:13.571
How much is all this?

22:13.707 --> 22:16.369
For only $360.

22:16.460 --> 22:17.495
We don't have that.

22:18.045 --> 22:21.208
Husband, it is time.

22:21.924 --> 22:23.005
Time for what?

22:23.092 --> 22:25.003
These things I buy on time.

22:25.094 --> 22:27.836
- Only $15 a week.
- That's over half my pay.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.841
For 12 months and we are done.

22:29.932 --> 22:31.388
12 months?

22:31.475 --> 22:35.810
(STAMMERING) That's <i>52</i> weeks times 15,
which comes to too much.

22:35.896 --> 22:38.058
It's too much, so it all has to go back.

22:38.148 --> 22:41.857
And don't make that face, please.
You need to understand.

22:41.944 --> 22:45.403
I live with the walls that are not painted
and the doors not hanging.

22:45.489 --> 22:47.526
I can't hang the doors. I've explained this.

22:47.616 --> 22:49.402
They sent the wrong doors with the kit.

22:49.493 --> 22:52.076
- And until this dispute is...
- Nelson.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.119
You buy the house that comes in the boxes.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.698
You put it together
with the hammer and the saw.

22:58.127 --> 23:00.118
I just followed the instructions.

23:03.173 --> 23:06.586
You're smart and you're strong.

23:07.928 --> 23:10.306
But it is a house still.

23:11.599 --> 23:14.466
I want to make the home.

23:14.768 --> 23:16.930
<i>For you.</i>

23:17.062 --> 23:18.803

- CHALKY: Daniel.
- Yes, Mr. White?

23:26.322 --> 23:28.313
Keep it open through here now.

23:29.491 --> 23:31.744
- We clear off in a minute.
- That's a minute too late.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.660
- MAN: Don't tell her that.
- I see that.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.533
No, sir. Ain't nothing.

23:36.624 --> 23:37.785
Y'all heard me the first time.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.741
Ain't standing for you red-eye and giggly.

23:39.835 --> 23:40.996
Yeah, we do hear you, Mr. White.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.417
You need to hear me a lot louder.

23:42.504 --> 23:45.417
Don't want that muggle around. Kill it.

- Daphne.
- Mr. White.

- LueHa.
- Good evening, Mr. White.

23:49.345 --> 23:51.086
Hey, Janine, you gonna
keep that leg up tonight?

23:51.180 --> 23:54.047
- Yes, sir.
- They're paying cash money out there now.

23:54.141 --> 23:55.848

24:01.023 --> 24:02.513
- About what?
- Mr. Pastor.

24:02.608 --> 24:04.019
He usually front us in advance.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.440
That between you and him.

24:05.527 --> 24:06.904
We ain't seen him since Friday.

24:09.531 --> 24:11.397
Tell you what,

24:11.492 --> 24:15.656

- Never know what?

25:05.921 --> 25:07.082
- Come on.
- How's that?

25:07.172 --> 25:09.504
Heard you knocked
the stuffing out of Joe Gans back of a barn.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.791
I ain't got the sand to cross you.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.668

- Come on. Come on.

Here it comes. Here it comes.

Oh, you got me down, friend.
You got me down.

another round on the house.

The Libyan performs in your club.

The Libyan serves in your club.

But the Libyan may not attend your club.

27:03.497 --> 27:04.532
Just a little.

27:04.623 --> 27:05.954
You needn't be.

27:06.041 --> 27:09.204
Mr. White is civilized. I am civilized.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.752
We're having a civilized conversation.

27:12.381 --> 27:13.371
May I sit?

I am not.

What are you?

27:33.277 --> 27:35.314
I am a man.

27:35.404 --> 27:38.897
I have business with Mr. Madden,
but I am not his man.

27:39.366 --> 27:41.152
Then why you here with her?

27:41.243 --> 27:43.405
Do you mind? It will be unpleasant.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.199
Go ahead.

27:46.331 --> 27:51.576
Because your employee slashed the throat
of my employee savagely.

Quite savagely.

27:53.088 --> 27:54.874
Which employee is that?

Mine was Dickie Pastor.

27:56.884 --> 27:58.716
Yours was... Forgive me, his name?

27:58.844 --> 28:00.255
He called him Dunn.

28:00.387 --> 28:01.627
You called him Dunn.

28:01.805 --> 28:03.546
Dickie had a rare eye.

28:03.640 --> 28:05.631
He had his flaws. Who does not?

28:05.767 --> 28:07.144
But a rare eye for talent.

28:07.311 --> 28:09.552
I came to rely upon it.

28:09.646 --> 28:11.762
Now he's gone.

28:11.857 --> 28:14.394
What shall we do, Mr. White?

28:14.484 --> 28:16.896
What shall we do?

28:25.454 --> 28:27.320
That would be a waste of my time.

28:27.581 --> 28:29.071
You're wasting it now.

28:29.166 --> 28:31.123

I have seen them succeed,
I've seen them fail very quickly.

45:40.821 --> 45:42.437
Very costly, hmm?

45:42.531 --> 45:44.067
I need to hear your price.

45:44.158 --> 45:47.617
It is for you to decide
what your friendship is worth.

45:47.703 --> 45:50.570
- I ain't paying a dime.
- Chalky.

45:50.665 --> 45:53.123
I give you one minute
to get your Jamaican ass...

45:53.209 --> 45:54.449
I am from Trinidad.

45:54.543 --> 45:56.079
CHALKY: I don't give a fuck where you from.

45:56.170 --> 45:58.502
- Chalky.
- Or where the fuck you going back to.

45:58.589 --> 46:01.172
Get your fucking John and Timothy ass...

46:01.259 --> 46:04.092
- See what I struggle with?
-...and all your high-hatting bullshit...

46:04.178 --> 46:06.340
Ten.

46:06.430 --> 46:09.092
10% of the club.

46:09.183 --> 46:12.266
The acts come back,
the other problem goes away,

46:12.353 --> 46:14.344
and it's 10%.

46:16.691 --> 46:19.604
That's a fair price. You're going to pay it.

46:19.694 --> 46:21.310
That's...

46:21.404 --> 46:23.771
That's my judgment.

46:26.534 --> 46:28.241
Do you accept?

46:30.663 --> 46:31.698
(SCOFFS)

46:33.291 --> 46:34.827
I do.

46:37.044 --> 46:38.205
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

46:38.296 --> 46:40.128
It's better off settled.

-(FOOTSTEPS APPROACH)
-(DOOR OPENS)

46:45.636 --> 46:47.297
NARCISSE: There you are.

46:47.388 --> 46:49.004
I didn't want to intrude.

46:49.098 --> 46:51.089
We're done here, dear.

46:51.183 --> 46:53.265
It's time to take you away.

47:04.697 --> 47:07.029
Get your story all told?

47:09.910 --> 47:11.821
The Negro in question.

47:13.914 --> 47:15.825
What's that make you?

47:15.916 --> 47:18.248
Merely another child of God.

47:22.298 --> 47:24.380
AGENT: What can you tell us
about the Adelphi Apothecary

47:24.467 --> 47:26.208
on Pacific Avenue?

47:28.054 --> 47:30.671
It's a drugstore, gentlemen.

47:31.390 --> 47:33.222
What about Gerald McHugh?

47:33.309 --> 47:35.141
I'm not familiar with that name.

47:35.227 --> 47:38.356
He ran a still raided
by the late Agent Stanley Sawicki

47:38.439 --> 47:40.646
just 26 days ago.

47:40.733 --> 47:44.852
Shortly after his arrest,
you signed an order for his release.

47:45.446 --> 47:48.814
- I sign a lot of orders, son.
- I'm not your son.

47:48.908 --> 47:51.024
It's a figure of speech.

47:51.869 --> 47:54.361
And if Agent Sawicki believed Mr. McHugh

47:54.455 --> 47:57.288
was more useful to us
as a confidential informer...

47:57.375 --> 47:59.491
HOOVER: Enoch Thompson.

47:59.585 --> 48:01.246
What about him?

48:01.337 --> 48:03.078
AGENT: Do you know him?

48:03.172 --> 48:05.038
I know who he is.

48:05.132 --> 48:07.794
You know of him or you know him?

48:10.137 --> 48:12.219
Who are you?

48:12.306 --> 48:13.922
Who is this Child?

48:14.016 --> 48:16.223
You can address me
as Acting Director Hoover.

48:16.310 --> 48:17.721
ELLIOT: Acting director of what?

48:17.812 --> 48:19.473
The Bureau of Investigation.

48:21.524 --> 48:22.980
What is this?

48:24.110 --> 48:25.145
Ira?

48:26.278 --> 48:28.315
What's going on?

48:28.781 --> 48:31.113
We're cooperating, Fred.

48:32.159 --> 48:34.070
With him?

48:34.161 --> 48:36.198
And his undercover operative.

48:51.178 --> 48:52.430
ELLIOT: What the hell is this?

48:52.513 --> 48:54.925
That's the cash you gave me yesterday, sir.

48:55.015 --> 48:57.677
After our meeting with Nucky Thompson.

49:00.146 --> 49:03.059
You lying little shit.

49:03.941 --> 49:05.773
- KNOX: I beg your pardon?
- I want to speak to a lawyer.

49:05.860 --> 49:09.228
No. No lawyers, Mr. Elliot.

49:09.905 --> 49:12.772
No calls, no telegrams.

49:12.867 --> 49:16.155
No alerting Nucky Thompson or anyone else

49:16.245 --> 49:19.112
who you're helping to subvert
the course of justice.

49:19.206 --> 49:20.867
I know this game and I'm not playing.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.700
I never saw this money.
I've never met Nucky Thompson.

49:23.794 --> 49:27.458
And you are completely
outside yourjurisdiction.

49:28.132 --> 49:31.670
I am not some Bolshevik under the bed.

49:31.760 --> 49:37.426
I am a natural-born US citizen
and a Treasury Department official.

49:37.725 --> 49:39.011
And I...

50:00.039 --> 50:02.827

50:02.917 --> 50:04.078
(SIGHS)

50:04.168 --> 50:07.911
The moral dimension is absent
from the criminal's makeup.

50:10.174 --> 50:11.915
Good beginning, Jim.

50:12.218 --> 50:13.834
I won't let you down, Edgar.

50:27.691 --> 50:29.523
Yes, dear?

50:29.610 --> 50:31.351
Pardon?

50:31.445 --> 50:33.061
You're looking at me.

50:34.782 --> 50:36.568
I just wanted to say thank you.

50:36.659 --> 50:37.945
For what?

50:38.911 --> 50:40.367
Coming to my rescue.

50:40.454 --> 50:43.037
Like a prince in a fairy tale.

50:43.123 --> 50:44.534
You are.

50:44.625 --> 50:46.161
To me.

50:48.963 --> 50:50.795
Did you get what you want?

50:50.881 --> 50:52.963
We will have to see.

50:53.050 --> 50:55.337
Dickie was a loss.

50:55.427 --> 50:58.044
A very great loss.

50:58.138 --> 51:00.220
And that man?

51:02.476 --> 51:04.888
Mr. Purnsley.

51:04.979 --> 51:07.141
What happens to him?

51:10.818 --> 51:12.183
What would you like to happen?

51:15.406 --> 51:18.068
What happened to Dickie, but worse.

51:18.742 --> 51:20.949
Ah, the Old Testament.

51:21.954 --> 51:24.491
After what he did to me...

51:24.665 --> 51:27.999
A tree? Some rope perhaps?

51:30.838 --> 51:33.330
Well, why not?

51:45.519 --> 51:46.759
(CAR STOPS)

51:51.191 --> 51:53.683
Need to check the tires, Doctor.

A thing mixed is a thing weakened.

52:13.797 --> 52:15.253
What?

52:15.341 --> 52:18.754
A thing mixed is a thing weakened.

52:21.597 --> 52:23.383
Is that from the Bible?

52:24.308 --> 52:25.798
It is from me.

52:30.230 --> 52:32.187
It's nice for cocktails.

52:32.274 --> 52:34.936
To hide the impurities,

52:35.027 --> 52:37.234
but they are there.

52:38.405 --> 52:41.989
And with each dilution, the spirit slips away.

52:43.243 --> 52:48.033
The spirit and the color,
until nothing authentic is left.

52:51.669 --> 52:55.162
How did Dickie know
what hotel to find you in?

52:56.090 --> 52:58.252

52:58.967 --> 53:00.833

And yet...

53:14.775 --> 53:18.393
And yet this is a tale
I've heard one time too many.

No.No.No!

No. No.

No, he raped...

53:26.495 --> 53:27.610
Raped me.

No!
