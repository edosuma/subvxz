WEBVTT

00:00.110 --> 00:01.389
Previously on "Timeless"...

00:01.400 --> 00:02.711
Maybe her life doesn't matter anymore

00:02.714 --> 00:03.695
now that you have your wife back.

00:03.698 --> 00:05.097
You were always on Wyatt's mind.

00:05.100 --> 00:07.564
He risked his job, his
freedom, everything,

00:07.568 --> 00:08.935
because he never stopped loving you.

00:08.937 --> 00:10.447
Jessica's giving me a second chance.

00:10.450 --> 00:11.969
You deserve to finally be happy, Wyatt.

00:11.971 --> 00:13.437
Lucy, sometimes I feel like

00:13.440 --> 00:14.985
I know you better
than you know yourself.

00:14.987 --> 00:16.860
What do you want from me,
Flynn? You don't know me.

00:16.862 --> 00:18.317
I guess what I was trying to say is

00:18.320 --> 00:20.265
that I'd like to get to know you.

00:21.735 --> 00:23.902
I saw you near the ocean,

00:23.904 --> 00:26.757
surrounded by cowboys,
I think. You died.

00:26.760 --> 00:28.039
I'm in the new location.

00:28.041 --> 00:29.568
This looks like a
Rittenhouse headquarters.

00:36.218 --> 00:37.582
Votes for women!

00:37.584 --> 00:39.084
Get out of here!

00:39.086 --> 00:40.715
Go take care of your kids!

00:40.718 --> 00:42.226
Get off the street!

00:42.229 --> 00:43.567
Go back to the kitchen!

00:43.570 --> 00:44.826
Votes for women!

00:44.828 --> 00:46.091
Lock 'em up!

00:46.093 --> 00:48.468
Go get a husband!
Your vote won't matter!

00:48.471 --> 00:49.937
Votes for women!

00:49.940 --> 00:51.106
All this nonsense!

00:51.109 --> 00:52.697
Votes for women!

00:52.699 --> 00:54.866
Go back and clean your house!

00:54.868 --> 00:56.401
Votes for women!

00:56.403 --> 00:58.603
Go back to your homes!

00:58.605 --> 01:00.205
Votes for women!

01:00.207 --> 01:01.966
Women belong at home!

01:01.969 --> 01:04.309
Votes for women!

01:04.311 --> 01:06.411
You're just a bunch of dumb girls!

01:06.413 --> 01:08.179
Votes for women!

01:08.181 --> 01:11.449
Go home! Return to your homes.

01:11.451 --> 01:12.617
Disperse!

01:12.619 --> 01:13.785
Yeah, you come home with me,

01:13.787 --> 01:15.372
I'll show you your place!

01:15.375 --> 01:17.522
Back up! Back up!

01:17.524 --> 01:19.590
You'd better back up. Back up!

01:19.593 --> 01:21.871
- Back up, I tell you!
- Stop! No!

01:24.264 --> 01:25.797
Break it up, now!

01:25.799 --> 01:27.215
Hey! Hey!

01:32.339 --> 01:33.972
Stop!

01:33.974 --> 01:35.106
Go home!

01:35.108 --> 01:38.009
- Return to your homes!
- Unhand me!

01:38.011 --> 01:41.880
Mr. President! Mr. President!

01:41.882 --> 01:43.531
I want...

01:43.534 --> 01:45.427
Mr. President, we should get you inside.

01:45.430 --> 01:47.152
One moment, Senator Wadsworth.

01:51.091 --> 01:53.091
I want to address those of you

01:53.094 --> 01:55.994
who think that women will not, cannot,

01:55.996 --> 01:58.296
and should not succeed.

01:58.298 --> 02:00.665
We will not be silenced,

02:00.667 --> 02:02.834
and we will not be ignored!

02:04.905 --> 02:07.305
It was we the people,

02:07.307 --> 02:09.794
not we the white male citizens,

02:09.797 --> 02:14.613
but we the whole people
who formed this Union.

02:14.615 --> 02:18.239
The time has come to give
women the right to vote!

02:24.969 --> 02:27.489
So I'm just supposed to
die somewhere in the 1800s?

02:27.492 --> 02:28.660
- I guess.
- You guess?

02:28.662 --> 02:30.748
My visions don't exactly
come with a time stamp, Rufus.

02:30.750 --> 02:32.130
So no time, no date.

02:32.132 --> 02:34.169
Just stabbed by some guy with bad teeth

02:34.172 --> 02:35.866
and spurs on his boots. Great.

02:35.869 --> 02:37.569
For all you know, it's
just a rough night in Reno.

02:37.571 --> 02:38.837
Can you please take this seriously?

02:38.839 --> 02:39.838
I do. Fully.

02:39.840 --> 02:41.075
From now on, no more cowboys

02:41.078 --> 02:42.407
or Kenny Chesney concerts.

02:42.409 --> 02:44.638
I saw the burn on your
arm. That happened.

02:44.641 --> 02:46.845
I saw the pilgrim die. That happened.

02:46.847 --> 02:48.513
My visions are real, Rufus, and...

02:48.515 --> 02:50.186
And underneath all the
jokes, you know that.

02:50.188 --> 02:51.749
- You know it.
- None of this has to happen.

02:51.751 --> 02:53.852
- None of this is set in stone.
- I wish that were true.

02:53.854 --> 02:56.754
You have no idea, okay,
but no matter what,

02:56.756 --> 02:58.256
JFK still died.

02:58.258 --> 03:00.358
No matter what, some things,
they just... they are.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.961
Then what am I supposed to do?

03:02.963 --> 03:05.263
I mean, if there is
absolutely nothing I can do

03:05.265 --> 03:07.232
to change what's happening,
then why even tell me?

03:07.234 --> 03:09.200
- You made me tell you!
- You listened to me?

03:09.202 --> 03:12.403
Look, I'm scared too, but...

03:12.405 --> 03:14.772
we just... we have to deal
with this, okay? Together.

03:14.774 --> 03:16.708
How? Buy a funeral plot?

03:16.710 --> 03:18.865
Make sure my Go-Bot collection
goes to the next generation?

03:18.867 --> 03:20.687
- That's not funny.
- I agree.

03:22.916 --> 03:25.116
Look, when my dad died,
there was no warning.

03:25.118 --> 03:27.619
Thanks for the warning,
but I am not your dad!

03:31.224 --> 03:32.991
Okay...

03:32.993 --> 03:35.326
Jiya.

03:37.000 --> 03:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:48.350 --> 03:53.911
I am going to remove myself
from your personal space.

03:53.914 --> 03:56.414
Thanks for...

03:56.416 --> 03:58.816
yep.

04:00.987 --> 04:03.154
Uh, I'll see you. Yeah.

04:10.997 --> 04:12.330
Hey.

04:12.332 --> 04:14.124
Any hot water left?

04:14.127 --> 04:15.828
Stay the hell away from her.

04:19.172 --> 04:22.640
Oh, you mean Lucy?

04:22.642 --> 04:26.511
You know she's not your wife, right?

04:26.513 --> 04:29.180
That's the, uh, blonde
lady just down the hall.

04:29.182 --> 04:32.583
Unless history's changed again.

04:32.585 --> 04:34.018
I'm warning you.

04:34.020 --> 04:35.468
What is it you want from her, Wyatt?

04:35.471 --> 04:36.871
Because if you have a problem,

04:36.874 --> 04:39.257
I suggest you talk to Lucy about it.

04:39.259 --> 04:42.527
She's perfectly capable
of making her own choices,

04:42.529 --> 04:45.396
don't you think?

04:55.508 --> 04:57.842
You know, you could just call for me.

04:57.844 --> 04:59.510
With your voice.

04:59.512 --> 05:02.080
When one can send a text message

05:02.082 --> 05:05.216
on a miracle like this, why?

05:06.619 --> 05:08.152
I got the water up and running.

05:08.154 --> 05:10.288
I know this place is
rustic, to say the least,

05:10.290 --> 05:11.289
but we'll fix it up.

05:11.291 --> 05:13.091
I fought in the Great War.

05:13.093 --> 05:15.194
I'm used to doing
without the finer things.

05:16.896 --> 05:19.230
Though I must confess, there
are certain modern comforts

05:19.232 --> 05:22.835
I find myself growing attached to.

05:24.670 --> 05:26.203
I've made a decision.

05:26.206 --> 05:27.538
On this next mission,

05:27.540 --> 05:29.540
I just want you to pilot the Mothership.

05:29.542 --> 05:32.877
Wait for Andre to activate our sleeper

05:32.879 --> 05:35.313
and then come back to me safely.

05:35.315 --> 05:37.915
Let someone else do the dirty work.

05:37.917 --> 05:40.385
But the dirty work is what I'm good at.

05:42.689 --> 05:46.257
You're too important.

05:46.259 --> 05:48.326
I'm flattered.

05:50.904 --> 05:54.407
You're not just my pilot, Emma.

05:56.136 --> 05:57.738
You're the only one I trust.

06:04.577 --> 06:06.045
Andre will handle it.

06:08.247 --> 06:09.746
Of course.

06:09.749 --> 06:11.883
Whatever you think best.

06:21.761 --> 06:24.128
They went to March 4, 1919, New York.

06:24.130 --> 06:25.923
New York, 1919, what happened?

06:25.926 --> 06:27.131
March 4th?

06:27.133 --> 06:28.699
That was Woodrow Wilson's last day

06:28.701 --> 06:30.068
in the United States
before traveling to Paris

06:30.070 --> 06:31.602
to negotiate the Treaty of Versailles.

06:31.604 --> 06:32.939
You think they're gonna
kill Woodrow Wilson

06:32.941 --> 06:34.305
to stop this treaty?

06:34.307 --> 06:36.040
That treaty basically
reorganized the world.

06:36.042 --> 06:37.962
Borders redrawn,
colonies gained freedom.

06:37.965 --> 06:40.211
Sweet. Rittenhouse wants
to make Germany great again.

06:40.214 --> 06:41.813
Wilson is staying at the York Hotel.

06:41.816 --> 06:43.848
- It's a place to start.
- All right.

06:49.589 --> 06:51.122
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:51.124 --> 06:52.657
Hey. Where do you think you're going?

06:52.659 --> 06:54.859
- 1919?
- Yeah, we're good, thanks.

06:54.861 --> 06:55.994
Wyatt.

06:57.964 --> 07:00.198
Uh, yeah, we're a team already.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.697
We're the Beatles. We don't need Yoko.

07:01.699 --> 07:02.884
You do realize there were

07:02.887 --> 07:04.349
four members of the Beatles, don't you?

07:04.351 --> 07:06.636
We've got four seats now,
and you can use the backup.

07:06.639 --> 07:08.272
- We're not leaving one empty.
- Well, bring Mason.

07:08.274 --> 07:09.807
- Uh, how do I put this?
- Hell no?

07:09.809 --> 07:11.142
- Yeah.
- Flynn's going.

07:11.144 --> 07:12.343
End of discussion.

07:12.345 --> 07:13.945
She's the boss.

07:13.947 --> 07:16.815
Oh, don't forget to say
good-bye to your wife.

07:39.093 --> 07:41.372
He's staying in the Presidential Suite.

07:43.443 --> 07:44.775
Was that already a gunshot?

07:44.777 --> 07:47.111
That was definitely a gunshot.

07:47.113 --> 07:49.173
We're too late.

07:58.872 --> 08:01.149
No photography.

08:01.152 --> 08:02.707
I'm gonna find out what's going on.

08:02.709 --> 08:03.908
- Yeah, I got it.
- No, I don't mind.

08:03.910 --> 08:05.310
I said I got it.

08:05.312 --> 08:06.911
Excuse me.

08:06.913 --> 08:09.514
Excuse me, Officer, was
President Wilson shot?

08:09.516 --> 08:12.350
Sir, please control your wife.

08:12.352 --> 08:13.785
Excuse me, Officer,

08:13.787 --> 08:15.054
what happened with President Wilson?

08:15.056 --> 08:17.355
The President is safe. There's no
more information at this time.

08:17.357 --> 08:19.557
Okay.

08:19.559 --> 08:21.126
Excuse me, do you work for the "Times"?

08:21.128 --> 08:22.529
- The "Post."
- Oh.

08:22.532 --> 08:23.704
Who'd they shoot?

08:23.707 --> 08:25.530
Senator Wadsworth. Bullet to the head.

08:25.532 --> 08:28.133
They already arrested
some militant suffragette.

08:28.135 --> 08:29.801
Alice Paul.

08:29.803 --> 08:31.703
Huh. Who's Alice Paul?

08:31.705 --> 08:33.738
Alice Paul was only one of
the most influential women

08:33.740 --> 08:35.039
in American history.

08:35.041 --> 08:36.474
More than Beyoncé?

08:36.476 --> 08:37.909
She led the Suffragette movement,

08:37.910 --> 08:39.677
ultimately getting
women the right to vote.

08:39.679 --> 08:42.046
I mean, every step forward
can be traced back to her.

08:42.048 --> 08:44.349
So Alice Paul killed Senator Wadsworth?

08:44.351 --> 08:46.785
No, no, Alice does...
Didn't kill anyone.

08:46.787 --> 08:49.521
She led the National Women's
Party for the next 50 years.

08:49.523 --> 08:51.556
So the sleeper must
have killed Wadsworth.

08:51.558 --> 08:53.424
- Is he important?
- Well, to his family, yes.

08:53.426 --> 08:56.127
But to history, not really.

08:56.129 --> 08:57.862
But Alice is.

08:57.864 --> 08:59.898
When President Wilson
arrives at the hotel today,

08:59.900 --> 09:01.709
Alice gives a speech, changing his mind

09:01.712 --> 09:02.928
to support the 19th Amendment.

09:02.931 --> 09:04.669
If Alice doesn't give that speech today,

09:04.671 --> 09:06.538
there's no telling when women
will get the right to vote.

09:06.540 --> 09:08.773
Okay. So we got to
get Alice out of jail.

09:08.775 --> 09:10.441
I'm gonna head out and find the sleeper.

09:10.443 --> 09:12.277
Easy, tiger. You're here
for backup, that's it.

09:12.279 --> 09:14.546
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize,

09:14.548 --> 09:16.483
since you were so busy
taking off your personal days.

09:16.485 --> 09:19.225
Guys, hello? Alice, the speech. Today.

09:19.228 --> 09:21.586
All right, Lucy and I
will get Alice out of jail.

09:21.588 --> 09:23.087
Rufus, you and Flynn find the sleepers.

09:23.089 --> 09:25.456
- Everybody happy?
- Uh, not particularly.

09:25.458 --> 09:26.925
Let's meet this afternoon.

09:26.927 --> 09:28.726
At the march.

09:28.728 --> 09:30.094
Rufus.

09:30.096 --> 09:31.996
We're on the same team now.

09:31.998 --> 09:35.967
Okay, look, I promise
not to kill you this trip.

09:35.969 --> 09:38.803
Feeling better?

09:38.805 --> 09:40.572
Actually, I do.

09:40.574 --> 09:42.473
'Cause you're not
gonna kill me this trip.

09:42.475 --> 09:44.976
See? Nothing to worry about.

09:44.978 --> 09:46.477
That's right.

09:46.479 --> 09:48.446
I ain't worried about a damn thing.

10:02.429 --> 10:03.461
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

10:03.463 --> 10:05.330
We need to see Alice Paul.

10:05.332 --> 10:07.045
Sorry, no visitors. Chief's orders.

10:07.048 --> 10:08.399
We're her attorneys.

10:08.401 --> 10:11.402
I'm Ally McBeal, and
this is Johnnie Cochran.

10:11.404 --> 10:12.903
She didn't ask for an attorney.

10:12.906 --> 10:14.105
Because she's innocent.

10:14.107 --> 10:16.298
They found the gun in her room.

10:16.301 --> 10:17.809
You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes

10:17.811 --> 10:19.777
to solve this one, lady.

10:19.779 --> 10:21.806
Sherlock Holmes...

10:21.809 --> 10:23.592
Is Grace Humiston in the building today?

10:23.595 --> 10:24.892
I don't know.

10:24.895 --> 10:27.279
She uses the visitor's room
down the hall sometimes.

10:27.282 --> 10:29.153
Oh, okay.

10:29.155 --> 10:31.456
Thank you.

10:31.458 --> 10:33.591
Who the hell is Grace Humiston?

10:33.593 --> 10:36.027
She would have been a
cop if it weren't 1919.

10:36.029 --> 10:38.997
She was a brilliant lawyer
and investigator the NYPD used

10:38.999 --> 10:41.560
to solve crimes they
couldn't crack or cast aside.

10:41.563 --> 10:42.800
Missing women, mostly.

10:42.802 --> 10:44.802
They actually called
her Mrs. Sherlock Holmes.

10:44.804 --> 10:46.304
Hmm.

11:03.090 --> 11:04.821
Mrs. Humiston?

11:06.292 --> 11:08.821
Sorry, I don't take romantic disputes.

11:08.824 --> 11:10.962
If you want my advice, you
have better things to do

11:10.964 --> 11:12.530
than waste your time
and your keen intellect

11:12.532 --> 11:14.299
on a married man,
even if he is a soldier

11:14.301 --> 11:15.466
and a war hero.

11:15.468 --> 11:16.801
How'd you know I was a soldier?

11:16.803 --> 11:18.036
You carry yourself like a soldier,

11:18.038 --> 11:19.170
always checking behind you.

11:19.172 --> 11:20.638
And you're clearly not a cop,

11:20.640 --> 11:21.804
but you're carrying a concealed weapon

11:21.806 --> 11:23.342
into a police station.

11:24.344 --> 11:25.777
The other stuff?

11:25.779 --> 11:27.445
You're wearing a
wedding ring, she's not.

11:27.447 --> 11:28.671
She's trying to keep
her distance from you.

11:28.673 --> 11:29.847
You're trying to get closer.

11:29.849 --> 11:31.015
And I'm betting he didn't tell you

11:31.017 --> 11:32.240
about the wife, either,

11:32.243 --> 11:33.743
but that one's just a guess.

11:33.746 --> 11:35.835
Okay, you know, it's a little
more complicated than that.

11:35.837 --> 11:37.422
Your keen intellect I
deduced from the fact

11:37.424 --> 11:39.557
that you came here looking for me.

11:39.559 --> 11:41.893
- You must read the papers.
- I do.

11:41.895 --> 11:43.528
And you are just incredible.

11:43.530 --> 11:46.064
Um, a role model. Ahead of your time.

11:46.066 --> 11:47.899
- Why are you here?
- Oh, uh, of course.

11:47.901 --> 11:50.001
Uh, we're here because there
was a woman who was arrested

11:50.003 --> 11:51.703
for a crime she did not commit.

11:51.705 --> 11:52.879
Alice Paul?

11:52.882 --> 11:54.038
I'm well-acquainted

11:54.040 --> 11:56.441
with Alice Paul and her antics.

11:56.443 --> 11:58.462
- What did she do now?
- Well, she didn't do anything.

11:58.464 --> 12:00.298
But she was arrested for
murdering Senator Wadsworth

12:00.300 --> 12:02.146
just this morning.

12:02.148 --> 12:05.083
A murder, huh?

12:05.085 --> 12:08.119
Got herself into a pickle this time.

12:08.121 --> 12:09.454
Alice is a Quaker.

12:09.456 --> 12:10.922
Not exactly the violent type,

12:10.924 --> 12:12.623
much less the type to
leave a murder weapon

12:12.625 --> 12:14.273
where it could be easily found.

12:14.276 --> 12:16.627
How did you know they found the weapon?

12:16.629 --> 12:18.229
You said Wadsworth was
killed this morning.

12:18.231 --> 12:19.990
How else could she have
been arrested so quickly?

12:19.992 --> 12:23.101
So you'll help us?

12:23.103 --> 12:25.136
I'll talk to Alice. We'll see.

12:25.138 --> 12:27.271
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Humiston.

12:27.273 --> 12:29.593
This is just... This is so...

12:32.112 --> 12:33.611
I don't mean to rush you,

12:33.613 --> 12:34.977
Mrs. Humiston, but
this really is urgent.

12:34.979 --> 12:36.947
Alice has to make a speech
this afternoon by 4:00.

12:36.950 --> 12:39.318
What she has to do is
stop making speeches.

12:41.454 --> 12:42.487
Okay.

12:54.734 --> 12:57.078
I need to see Miss Paul, please.

12:57.081 --> 12:58.269
Sure, Grace.

12:58.271 --> 12:59.523
Can I get you a coffee

12:59.526 --> 13:01.305
or anything to eat before we go?

13:01.307 --> 13:03.074
Ten minutes.

13:03.076 --> 13:04.475
I'm asking nicely.

13:04.477 --> 13:06.611
Sorry, no can do. Chief's orders.

13:06.613 --> 13:08.679
Cops... Real cops only.

13:10.316 --> 13:11.516
Well, if memory serves,

13:11.518 --> 13:12.817
another one of the chief's orders

13:12.819 --> 13:14.285
is no drinking on the job, right, Lou?

13:14.287 --> 13:15.653
Do you want me to check
your top right drawer

13:15.655 --> 13:17.790
and see what I find?

13:25.131 --> 13:26.999
You have five minutes.

13:29.836 --> 13:31.666
Alice Paul. Wow.

13:31.669 --> 13:32.801
We're here to get you out.

13:32.804 --> 13:34.172
And this is Grace Humiston.

13:34.174 --> 13:35.641
We've met.

13:39.179 --> 13:42.713
- You gonna ask her questions?
- No.

13:42.715 --> 13:44.549
Guess we're supposed to be Watson?

13:47.367 --> 13:48.903
Where were you earlier this morning?

13:48.906 --> 13:50.121
I was in my room,

13:50.123 --> 13:51.656
preparing my speech for the march.

13:51.658 --> 13:53.357
Next thing you know,
my door is kicked in,

13:53.359 --> 13:54.833
and I have handcuffs on.

13:54.836 --> 13:56.040
They found the gun in your room,

13:56.042 --> 13:58.361
and we all know about your
run-ins with Senator Wadsworth.

13:58.364 --> 14:00.465
And we all know what
you and your cop cronies

14:00.467 --> 14:02.266
think of the Movement,
but I'm innocent, Grace.

14:02.268 --> 14:04.138
Well, that's not how it
looks to the cops, Alice.

14:04.140 --> 14:05.503
You mean the cops that lock us up?

14:05.505 --> 14:07.630
That beat us? That call us militants?

14:07.633 --> 14:10.200
They have ample reason to want
me in prison, don't you think?

14:10.203 --> 14:12.076
I'd like you to leave.

14:16.516 --> 14:18.149
Alice, we both know

14:18.151 --> 14:19.550
what they're gonna do to you in here...

14:19.552 --> 14:21.586
The starvation, the forced feedings.

14:21.588 --> 14:23.354
I've done it all before.

14:23.356 --> 14:26.062
You want to help? Get the press in here.

14:26.065 --> 14:27.725
When they see how we've been treated,

14:27.727 --> 14:29.484
it'll change more hearts and minds

14:29.487 --> 14:31.294
than anything I could say.

14:31.297 --> 14:33.431
Yes, I... I believe
that, and... and it will,

14:33.433 --> 14:37.201
but if you really want to
change hearts and minds,

14:37.203 --> 14:38.736
give that speech this afternoon.

14:38.738 --> 14:40.438
Trust me.

14:44.277 --> 14:45.586
Uh...

14:49.082 --> 14:51.048
You treated her like a criminal.

14:51.050 --> 14:52.617
She's fighting on our behalf.

14:52.619 --> 14:54.952
- Whose behalf?
- Yours. Mine.

14:54.954 --> 14:56.254
- What, women in general?
- Yeah.

14:56.256 --> 14:57.755
Alice has no job, no husband,

14:57.757 --> 14:59.290
and does nothing but create hysteria.

14:59.292 --> 15:01.626
You think she's actually
helping your cause?

15:01.628 --> 15:03.427
I don't know about you, but
I'd rather earn my respect

15:03.429 --> 15:04.462
- than grovel for it.
- No, I...

15:04.464 --> 15:05.763
Now, if you don't mind,

15:05.765 --> 15:07.732
I'm going to talk to Detective Riley.

15:07.734 --> 15:09.200
Alice said her door was kicked in.

15:09.202 --> 15:10.768
That's his trademark.

15:10.770 --> 15:12.161
You two wait here.

15:12.164 --> 15:14.138
Cops don't like people they don't know.

15:19.479 --> 15:21.586
- Not how you pictured her?
- Not exactly.

15:21.589 --> 15:23.255
She's entitled to her
point of view, Lucy.

15:23.258 --> 15:25.016
Yeah, well, her point of view is wrong.

15:28.254 --> 15:30.021
What?

15:30.023 --> 15:31.656
- Nothing.
- No, something.

15:31.658 --> 15:33.659
Tell me.

15:34.826 --> 15:37.460
You want to talk? Fine, let's talk.

15:37.463 --> 15:39.931
I saw you this morning.

15:39.933 --> 15:43.267
- Saw me what?
- Coming out of Flynn's room.

15:43.269 --> 15:45.469
Flynn, for God's sakes?

15:45.471 --> 15:48.140
The terrorist who spent all
last year trying to kill us?

15:48.143 --> 15:50.007
Look, I know the Jessica
thing was a little unexpected,

15:50.009 --> 15:51.412
and... and maybe you're on
the rebound or something...

15:51.414 --> 15:53.110
Rebound? I'm sorry, from what?

15:53.112 --> 15:54.979
Our one-night relationship?

15:54.981 --> 15:56.547
That is not what I meant.

15:56.550 --> 15:58.516
I just meant that you
are making a big mistake.

15:58.518 --> 15:59.584
What I do and who I do it with

15:59.586 --> 16:01.253
is none of your damn business.

16:05.860 --> 16:07.895
What on earth happened between you two?

16:10.697 --> 16:12.363
Wow.

16:12.365 --> 16:15.333
So people could just walk
into crime scenes in 1919?

16:15.335 --> 16:18.636
Well, better to ask
forgiveness than permission.

16:18.638 --> 16:20.671
So what exactly are we looking for?

16:20.673 --> 16:22.840
Well, the sleeper agent killed Wadsworth

16:22.842 --> 16:24.508
and framed Alice Paul,

16:24.510 --> 16:26.210
so maybe he left a clue.

16:26.212 --> 16:28.045
So maybe we can find him

16:28.047 --> 16:29.984
so I can kill him.

16:29.987 --> 16:31.816
You know, sometimes
I think you're normal.

16:31.818 --> 16:33.351
Then you say stuff like
that, and I remember,

16:33.353 --> 16:35.812
oh, wait, no, he's frickin' nuts.

16:35.815 --> 16:37.971
What are you two doing in here?

16:39.826 --> 16:42.360
We are Pinkertons.

16:42.362 --> 16:44.295
You two are dicks?

16:44.297 --> 16:47.665
That's right. We are detectives.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.590
I'm John McClane.

16:49.593 --> 16:50.757
This is my partner,

16:50.760 --> 16:52.702
- Hans Gruber.
- You two don't like

16:52.705 --> 16:54.505
- like Pinkertons.
- Officer...

16:54.507 --> 16:56.207
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, don't reach.

16:56.209 --> 16:57.508
Hands up. You too.

16:57.510 --> 16:58.643
Turn around.

16:58.645 --> 17:00.289
Turn around!

17:01.490 --> 17:02.679
Keep those hands up.

17:04.983 --> 17:06.983
- You know what, Flynn?
- What?

17:06.986 --> 17:09.403
- Take him down.
- Hey, you crazy, boy?

17:09.406 --> 17:10.887
Look, I'm not dying here
man. Go ahead and do it.

17:10.890 --> 17:12.709
- Rufus, stop talking.
- Take him down right now.

17:12.711 --> 17:13.924
You've been killing guys all week.

17:13.925 --> 17:15.660
- Stop talking!
- Hey Flynn, Flynn it up,

17:15.662 --> 17:16.894
- Flynn.
- Don't... stop talking.

17:16.896 --> 17:17.928
- Take him down!
- Stop talking!

17:25.338 --> 17:27.606
Hey, look. A couple of dicks.

17:31.394 --> 17:33.092
I missed you, Flynn.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.274
Great. It's Emma.

17:35.276 --> 17:36.478
Yay.

17:44.485 --> 17:45.900
Admit it.

17:45.903 --> 17:47.620
This gets you kind of hot
and bothered, doesn't it?

17:47.622 --> 17:49.522
Just give me one good reason

17:49.524 --> 17:51.591
why I shouldn't kill you
right here, right now.

17:51.593 --> 17:52.792
I know who your sleeper is.

17:52.794 --> 17:54.093
You need my help.

17:54.095 --> 17:55.949
Help? You're gonna help us?

17:55.952 --> 17:57.280
That's right.

17:57.283 --> 18:00.132
This time, this mission, one night only,

18:00.134 --> 18:01.867
I actually want to stop Rittenhouse.

18:01.869 --> 18:03.967
I won't hurt you. You have my word.

18:03.970 --> 18:06.038
Oh, I should just take your
word for it, you piece of...

18:06.040 --> 18:08.889
Aww, did I hurt your
little psycho feelings

18:08.892 --> 18:10.314
when I double-crossed you?

18:10.317 --> 18:11.784
Poor little baby.

18:13.557 --> 18:15.324
I didn't have to kill that cop.

18:15.327 --> 18:16.816
I could have killed
the two of you instead.

18:16.818 --> 18:19.351
Okay, okay.

18:19.353 --> 18:21.666
Cards up.

18:21.669 --> 18:24.857
Nicholas wants to squash
the 19th Amendment, okay?

18:24.859 --> 18:28.244
To put women in their place.

18:28.247 --> 18:29.759
Let's just say I disagree.

18:29.762 --> 18:30.996
After all the crap you pulled,

18:30.998 --> 18:32.098
that's where you draw the line?

18:32.100 --> 18:33.899
Constitutional law?

18:33.901 --> 18:35.634
I have my reasons.

18:35.636 --> 18:37.903
We can find the sleeper
agent without you.

18:37.905 --> 18:40.339
There's also some other orders.

18:40.341 --> 18:42.392
There's orders to kill Lucy.

18:45.011 --> 18:46.945
Like it or not...

18:46.948 --> 18:49.116
I'm your best shot.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.356
What's all this?

18:57.358 --> 18:59.892
Oh, this is the mess
Agent Christopher and Wyatt

18:59.894 --> 19:03.562
managed to retrieve from
Rittenhouse headquarters.

19:03.564 --> 19:05.798
- Any of it salvageable?
- Don't know yet.

19:05.800 --> 19:09.268
Won't know till we find
two very small needles

19:09.270 --> 19:11.771
in this very large haystack.

19:11.773 --> 19:13.939
Want some help?

19:13.941 --> 19:16.776
I'm here. May as well
make myself useful.

19:16.778 --> 19:18.377
Why not?

19:18.379 --> 19:19.813
So...

19:22.984 --> 19:24.917
You okay?

19:24.919 --> 19:26.519
Yeah, sorry, just, uh...

19:26.521 --> 19:27.720
stuff with Rufus.

19:27.722 --> 19:29.822
Love issues. Been there.

19:29.824 --> 19:32.324
They can feel like life
and death, can't they?

19:32.326 --> 19:35.694
- You have no idea.
- Why don't you join us?

19:35.704 --> 19:38.540
Guess I could move from one
hopeless situation to another.

19:40.034 --> 19:41.700
Right, so...

19:41.702 --> 19:43.636
You want to tell me
what happened back there

19:43.638 --> 19:45.638
with that cop? I mean,
what, you don't care

19:45.640 --> 19:48.340
- if he blows your brains out?
- Maybe I'm just super brave.

19:48.342 --> 19:50.009
Yeah, and maybe I'm
Jean-Claude Van Damme.

19:50.011 --> 19:51.877
Okay, okay.

19:51.879 --> 19:53.612
I know I'm not gonna die here.

19:53.614 --> 19:55.381
- What's that mean?
- Jiya told me.

19:55.383 --> 19:56.820
Apparently I die in cowboy times.

19:56.823 --> 19:57.889
- What?
- It's okay.

19:57.892 --> 19:59.218
It's a good thing. For now.

19:59.220 --> 20:01.987
No cowboys means no
dead Rufus. I'm safe.

20:01.989 --> 20:04.892
Until someone blows your
kneecaps off, you idiot.

20:08.377 --> 20:10.696
Never thought I'd see the
two of you working together,

20:10.698 --> 20:12.259
whispering like schoolgirls.

20:12.262 --> 20:14.300
How 'bout you just tell us
where the sleeper agent is

20:14.302 --> 20:16.368
and we all go our separate ways?

20:16.370 --> 20:19.238
I'm not stupid. If I
tell you, you'll kill me.

20:19.240 --> 20:21.740
I lead. You follow.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.709
I just want to know, was any of it true?

20:23.711 --> 20:27.112
Any of what you told
me when we first met?

20:27.114 --> 20:28.747
About what Rittenhouse did to you?

20:28.749 --> 20:32.084
She is a pretty good liar.

20:32.086 --> 20:35.654
There are certain things
they do to test your loyalty.

20:35.656 --> 20:39.692
Leaving me alone in the 1880s
for ten years was one of them.

20:39.694 --> 20:41.093
Guess I passed.

20:41.095 --> 20:42.928
Why would you be loyal
to people like that?

20:42.930 --> 20:44.263
Hell of a dental plan.

20:46.234 --> 20:48.667
If you're leading us into a trap,

20:48.669 --> 20:51.036
you'd better hope your
loyalty is worth dying for.

20:51.038 --> 20:52.705
We're headed to the march.

20:52.707 --> 20:55.407
- The march?
- Why?

20:55.409 --> 20:57.910
The sleeper?

20:57.912 --> 20:59.678
She's a suffragette.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.348
Detective Riley says his
whole case hinges on you.

21:02.350 --> 21:04.550
He says you saw Alice go
into the senator's room.

21:04.552 --> 21:06.285
Yep, just like I told the police.

21:06.287 --> 21:08.220
And you just happened
to know who she was?

21:08.222 --> 21:09.255
Everyone knows her.

21:09.257 --> 21:10.589
I've seen her in the papers,

21:10.591 --> 21:11.947
rabble-rousing.

21:11.950 --> 21:13.850
Now, why don't you tell
us what really happened?

21:13.853 --> 21:14.857
You know what?

21:14.860 --> 21:16.761
I don't have to waste
my break talking to you.

21:16.764 --> 21:18.564
Blow off, lady.

21:18.566 --> 21:20.900
Do you want me to go
after him, 'cause I...

21:20.902 --> 21:22.116
I guess she's got this.

21:22.119 --> 21:23.389
Guess she does.

21:23.392 --> 21:25.634
Either you tell us the
truth, or I tell the manager

21:25.637 --> 21:27.372
that you've been dealing
dope to the guests.

21:27.375 --> 21:29.045
- Did you see that coming?
- I did not.

21:29.048 --> 21:31.276
You have burns on your
fingers from making the dope,

21:31.279 --> 21:33.579
you're wearing a watch
no bellhop could afford,

21:33.581 --> 21:35.381
and you have a bulge in your pocket.

21:35.383 --> 21:37.116
Shall we look?

21:37.118 --> 21:39.785
I get notes from guests
who want something.

21:39.787 --> 21:41.754
Last night, I got a
note offering me 50 bucks

21:41.756 --> 21:44.456
to tell Detective
Riley that I saw Alice.

21:44.458 --> 21:46.191
- She was never here, all right?
- The note.

21:46.193 --> 21:48.794
I assume you kept it, and
I should like to see it.

21:48.796 --> 21:50.296
It was left in my box.

21:50.298 --> 21:52.598
Maybe Alice could
identify the handwriting?

21:52.600 --> 21:54.066
Yes.

21:54.068 --> 21:55.802
Maybe she can.

22:03.544 --> 22:05.277
Alice?

22:15.623 --> 22:17.556
Sweet Mary and Joseph.

22:23.030 --> 22:24.287
No.

22:26.224 --> 22:29.858
Wyatt said they're...
They're calling it a suicide?

22:29.861 --> 22:31.861
I don't buy it either.

22:31.864 --> 22:34.604
Whoever killed Wadsworth took
care of Alice to shut her up.

22:34.607 --> 22:36.485
Catch the guy, solve two cases.

22:36.487 --> 22:38.162
She's not just a case,

22:38.165 --> 22:39.765
and she wasn't supposed to die.

22:39.768 --> 22:41.013
Not like this, not now.

22:41.016 --> 22:42.491
Every murder is tragic.

22:42.493 --> 22:44.138
Alice Paul is not every murder.

22:44.141 --> 22:45.761
Find someone else to give the speech.

22:45.763 --> 22:47.230
We won't find another Alice Paul.

22:47.232 --> 22:49.025
Speeches and marches
don't change the world.

22:49.028 --> 22:50.127
Never have, never will.

22:50.130 --> 22:51.367
You're wrong. Some do.

22:51.369 --> 22:53.302
Some speeches inspire a movement.

22:53.304 --> 22:55.304
- This one will.
- That's not my job.

22:55.306 --> 22:57.373
My job is to solve this case.

22:57.375 --> 22:59.443
You can help, or you
can get out of my way.

23:06.751 --> 23:09.452
Make sure that these
are in a pile together.

23:11.024 --> 23:12.455
Mrs. Humiston!

23:12.457 --> 23:13.923
What are you doing here?

23:13.925 --> 23:17.126
- I have news about Alice.
- Is Alice okay?

23:17.128 --> 23:19.451
Does she still want us to march?

23:19.454 --> 23:21.982
- I'll tell them.
- Alice Paul is dead.

23:24.522 --> 23:27.089
The cops.

23:27.092 --> 23:29.170
They did this to her, didn't they?

23:29.173 --> 23:30.831
And you're practically one of them.

23:30.834 --> 23:32.161
No, no, no, Grace is with us.

23:32.164 --> 23:34.740
She's helping us find
out who did this to Alice.

23:34.743 --> 23:36.748
And who are you two?

23:36.751 --> 23:41.286
We are... Uh, we were Alice's lawyers.

23:41.289 --> 23:44.420
And we believe that she would
want us to keep fighting.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.821
We have the notes for her
speech for this afternoon.

23:46.824 --> 23:49.358
Who will stand up and help us

23:49.360 --> 23:53.629
fight to keep Alice's legacy alive?

23:53.631 --> 23:56.224
I appreciate that you came,

23:56.227 --> 23:58.393
but Alice was special.

23:58.396 --> 24:00.602
- I think we all need some time.
- No, there's no time.

24:00.605 --> 24:02.305
The President is leaving
the country tomorrow.

24:02.307 --> 24:04.427
- It has to be today.
- It seems disrespectful.

24:04.430 --> 24:07.075
It would be disrespectful
not to honor Alice's memory.

24:07.078 --> 24:08.318
It would be disrespectful

24:08.321 --> 24:09.789
to ignore everything that she stood for,

24:09.791 --> 24:13.115
everything that she sacrificed for us.

24:18.089 --> 24:21.706
Ma'am, uh, I'm actually a soldier,

24:21.709 --> 24:24.237
and I've lost good people.

24:24.240 --> 24:25.760
Doesn't mean you should quit.

24:25.763 --> 24:27.930
What would Alice want?

24:27.933 --> 24:29.533
A vigil.

24:29.536 --> 24:32.403
We march, but silently.

24:32.406 --> 24:33.906
Show our resolve

24:33.909 --> 24:36.121
and our respect for
Alice at the same time.

24:36.124 --> 24:37.862
With respect, a silent march

24:37.865 --> 24:40.343
is not going to get the job
done today, not this time.

24:40.345 --> 24:42.182
I suggest a vote.

24:42.185 --> 24:44.352
I'd like to see a show of hands.

24:44.355 --> 24:46.322
Everyone in favor of a silent march,

24:46.325 --> 24:48.024
raise your hand.

24:52.223 --> 24:54.534
It's settled, then.

24:54.537 --> 24:55.995
Vigil it is.

24:59.736 --> 25:02.098
Just like old times, huh, Rufus?

25:02.100 --> 25:03.566
Yeah.

25:03.568 --> 25:06.435
Well, except for the
fact that since that time,

25:06.437 --> 25:08.437
you've been trying to
kill me and my friends,

25:08.439 --> 25:12.378
but yeah, totally some
crazy nostalgic vibes.

25:12.381 --> 25:15.641
I guess we both got fooled.

25:15.644 --> 25:18.046
Look, when the march starts,
I'm gonna need to get out there

25:18.049 --> 25:21.587
to find the sleeper and
to neutralize her, so...

25:21.590 --> 25:23.819
if you want my help, you're
gonna have to trust me.

25:23.821 --> 25:25.173
Trust?

25:25.176 --> 25:27.589
Back when you, me, and
Anthony used to work together,

25:27.592 --> 25:29.509
we'd pull some all-nighters sometimes,

25:29.512 --> 25:31.360
but we didn't mind
because we loved the work.

25:31.362 --> 25:33.462
That, and we were friends.

25:33.464 --> 25:34.876
Or so I thought.

25:34.879 --> 25:36.698
Turns out, Anthony
was working with Flynn,

25:36.701 --> 25:38.167
and you were working for Rittenhouse.

25:38.169 --> 25:40.703
Oh, my God, I suck at picking friends.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.388
What's in this for you?

25:42.391 --> 25:44.440
- I like voting.
- Oh, please.

25:44.442 --> 25:47.109
You only ever cared
about one person: you.

25:47.111 --> 25:51.380
So uh, why are you really doing this?

25:51.382 --> 25:52.848
If I tell you, will you let me do

25:52.850 --> 25:54.583
what I came here to do?

25:54.585 --> 25:55.919
We'll see.

25:59.956 --> 26:02.624
Last-second field goal.

26:02.627 --> 26:04.728
His team didn't cover the spread.

26:09.067 --> 26:11.801
Dinner was cold.

26:11.803 --> 26:13.169
But most of the time,

26:13.171 --> 26:16.739
it was just because Dad was angry.

26:16.741 --> 26:20.743
Still don't know how my
mom found the courage.

26:20.745 --> 26:22.611
But we got in the car, we headed west,

26:22.613 --> 26:26.682
and we started a new life.

26:26.684 --> 26:28.351
She put me in a science magnet school,

26:28.353 --> 26:31.187
and I graduated at the
top of my damn class.

26:31.189 --> 26:32.641
I was one of three women

26:32.644 --> 26:34.323
to make it through
the program at Caltech.

26:34.325 --> 26:36.625
Rittenhouse found me.

26:36.627 --> 26:38.694
They were begging me
to come work for them.

26:38.696 --> 26:44.300
But if women can't vote...

26:44.302 --> 26:49.705
if... if we're property...

26:49.707 --> 26:51.774
we would have been trapped

26:51.776 --> 26:56.479
with that drunk bastard forever.

26:56.481 --> 27:00.983
So damn straight I'm doing this for me.

27:00.985 --> 27:06.222
And for my mom.

27:06.224 --> 27:08.991
So trust me or not,

27:08.993 --> 27:10.526
I don't care.

27:10.528 --> 27:14.497
One way or another, I'm
killing that sleeper.

27:36.154 --> 27:38.945
Great. Now both my enemies have guns.

27:42.193 --> 27:44.160
A silent vigil. Thanks.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.528
Thanks for that.

27:45.530 --> 27:46.962
Funny that you called for a vote.

27:46.964 --> 27:49.156
Last time they'll get
to do that for a while.

27:49.159 --> 27:50.616
You have a difficult relationship

27:50.619 --> 27:51.918
with your mother, don't you?

27:51.921 --> 27:53.235
- What?
- I can tell because...

27:53.237 --> 27:54.742
I don't care. Don't change the subject.

27:54.744 --> 27:56.538
I'm trying to solve a
murder. Two, actually.

27:56.541 --> 27:59.542
If the speech is so important,
why don't you give it?

27:59.544 --> 28:01.434
If you think that Alice can be reduced

28:01.437 --> 28:02.921
to one day and one speech,

28:02.924 --> 28:05.029
then you really have no idea
what all of this is about,

28:05.031 --> 28:06.241
- do you?
- Excuse me?

28:06.244 --> 28:08.050
You think because you are
smart enough or tough enough

28:08.052 --> 28:09.912
to make it into the boys'
club that everybody else

28:09.914 --> 28:11.387
should be able to do
that too, is that it?

28:11.389 --> 28:13.322
- Something like that.
- So you're under no obligation

28:13.324 --> 28:15.658
- to... to help other women.
- I find the missing.

28:15.660 --> 28:17.393
I catch their murderers.
I put them away.

28:17.395 --> 28:20.196
- That's how I help women.
- Dead women, you mean.

28:20.198 --> 28:22.064
You help dead women.
What about everyone else?

28:22.066 --> 28:23.933
Everyone else isn't my problem.

28:23.935 --> 28:26.235
You think that Alice wanted
to be beaten by police,

28:26.237 --> 28:28.471
- sent to prison, force-fed?
- I didn't say that.

28:28.473 --> 28:30.105
She would have spent the next 50 years

28:30.107 --> 28:32.274
living the same hell over and over again

28:32.276 --> 28:34.343
so women like you could
ride on her coattails.

28:34.345 --> 28:35.945
Every day that you get to do your job,

28:35.947 --> 28:37.347
another woman out there
is making sacrifices

28:37.349 --> 28:38.769
so that you can keep doing it.

28:38.772 --> 28:40.082
If you're not gonna help, Grace,

28:40.084 --> 28:41.917
then just get the hell out of the way!

28:41.919 --> 28:43.653
- Maybe...
- What?

28:45.656 --> 28:48.257
Maybe you could give the speech.

28:48.259 --> 28:51.327
Oh.

28:51.329 --> 28:53.930
You know what? Maybe I will.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.633
Lucy.

28:59.572 --> 29:02.168
Lucy, the sleeper wants
to stop the speech.

29:02.171 --> 29:03.772
They will shoot whoever goes up there.

29:03.774 --> 29:05.494
Would it be better if
it was someone else?

29:07.244 --> 29:09.477
Rittenhouse already has
a target on your back.

29:09.480 --> 29:10.813
You said it yourself.
They need a leader,

29:10.815 --> 29:12.014
but they need a leader here, not someone

29:12.016 --> 29:13.382
who's gonna jump in a time machine.

29:13.384 --> 29:15.655
But someone has to do something now.

29:15.658 --> 29:16.964
I'm not gonna let you get hurt.

29:16.967 --> 29:19.154
Little late for that.

29:19.156 --> 29:21.190
What's that supposed to mean?

29:21.192 --> 29:23.125
Okay, look, Wyatt, I
have tried really hard

29:23.127 --> 29:24.593
to separate whatever's
going on between us

29:24.595 --> 29:25.828
from the work that we have to do,

29:25.830 --> 29:27.425
but you are not making it easy.

29:27.428 --> 29:28.697
You think this has been easy for me?

29:28.699 --> 29:30.266
You got the love of
your life back, Wyatt,

29:30.268 --> 29:32.334
and I got the rug pulled
out from under me again,

29:32.336 --> 29:33.836
so I would really appreciate
it if you would stop acting

29:33.838 --> 29:35.304
like you were the one that got screwed.

29:35.306 --> 29:37.702
- I'm...
- I have a speech to deliver.

29:43.491 --> 29:45.357
Go get a husband!

29:45.360 --> 29:48.067
Get out of here!

29:48.069 --> 29:51.437
You don't deserve the vote!

29:51.439 --> 29:54.373
Why don't you go home and
take care of your kids?

29:56.277 --> 29:58.019
Ah, stop this nonsense!

29:58.022 --> 29:59.979
You'll mess up your dresses!

30:04.051 --> 30:05.618
Old maid!

30:10.491 --> 30:11.657
Hey. Hey, hey, hey!

30:11.659 --> 30:13.859
It's just us.

30:13.861 --> 30:15.332
Any luck with Alice Paul?

30:15.335 --> 30:18.197
Alice is dead. The sleeper got to her.

30:18.199 --> 30:20.065
Of course she did. The
sleeper's a suffragette.

30:20.067 --> 30:22.968
What? What do you know?

30:22.970 --> 30:24.436
- Emma.
- Emma?

30:24.438 --> 30:26.105
You saw her? Did you kill her?

30:26.107 --> 30:29.008
- She's helping us.
- You actually bought that?

30:29.010 --> 30:31.147
I know it's hard to believe,
but long story short,

30:31.150 --> 30:32.317
we are on a one-mission truce,

30:32.319 --> 30:33.846
and she's taking out the sleeper.

30:33.848 --> 30:35.814
She's the only one who
knows what she looks like,

30:35.816 --> 30:37.984
and she's trying to find her right now.

30:39.687 --> 30:41.754
I'm keeping an eye on her, okay?

30:49.330 --> 30:51.630
You?

30:51.632 --> 30:54.500
Any last words I can
pass along to your mother?

30:54.502 --> 30:57.236
Tell her she can go to hell.

31:00.374 --> 31:02.141
Looking for these?

31:05.313 --> 31:06.512
What? How?

31:11.525 --> 31:13.107
Hello, Emma.

31:14.655 --> 31:16.255
Sorry. Plan's changed.

31:18.659 --> 31:20.726
- What are you doing?
- Yeah!

31:20.728 --> 31:22.960
What are you doing?

31:22.963 --> 31:24.960
You're welcome.

31:24.963 --> 31:27.230
What are you waiting for, princess?

31:27.233 --> 31:29.694
Someone's got to make that speech.

31:29.697 --> 31:31.927
I'd do it myself, but
motivational speaking

31:31.930 --> 31:34.598
isn't really my thing.

31:45.019 --> 31:46.285
Okay, what information

31:46.287 --> 31:47.486
do you even think is gonna be on here?

31:47.488 --> 31:48.621
Well, it could be anything.

31:48.623 --> 31:50.255
List of names,

31:50.257 --> 31:52.311
financial statements, dates...

31:52.314 --> 31:53.692
Rittenhouse grocery list?

31:53.694 --> 31:55.019
Pizza rolls with a side of evil?

31:57.298 --> 31:58.565
Ah...

32:02.069 --> 32:04.837
Holy crap.

32:04.839 --> 32:06.280
This might work.

32:06.283 --> 32:08.573
You know, honestly, I didn't
think we'd get anything.

32:08.576 --> 32:10.075
But you spent all day
working on something

32:10.077 --> 32:11.208
you thought was a waste of time?

32:11.210 --> 32:12.335
My dear,

32:12.338 --> 32:14.379
the grandest, most honorable battle

32:14.382 --> 32:16.081
is the losing one.

32:16.083 --> 32:17.983
But you've got to keep fighting.

32:23.557 --> 32:25.090
Grace.

32:25.092 --> 32:27.426
Grace!

32:27.428 --> 32:28.788
What happened?

32:28.791 --> 32:31.562
Emma shot the sleeper.
She saved my life.

32:31.565 --> 32:33.475
- Where'd she go?
- She's gone.

32:33.478 --> 32:35.426
Must have crawled back
to the hole she came from.

32:35.429 --> 32:37.269
Look.

32:37.271 --> 32:38.605
Disperse! Go back!

32:38.608 --> 32:41.273
- Back it up.
- Go home!

32:41.275 --> 32:43.475
- It's gonna get ugly.
- Yeah.

32:43.477 --> 32:45.611
Rufus, stay back!

32:45.613 --> 32:46.913
I'm not dying today.

32:48.148 --> 32:50.248
Back up! Back up!

32:50.251 --> 32:51.684
Disperse!

32:51.686 --> 32:53.316
Votes for women!

32:53.319 --> 32:55.468
- Votes for women!
- Step back, I tell ya!

32:55.471 --> 32:56.689
Votes for women!

32:58.359 --> 33:00.491
Votes for women!

33:00.494 --> 33:01.927
Stop!

33:01.929 --> 33:03.762
Please!

33:03.764 --> 33:05.798
Get out of here!

33:05.800 --> 33:06.999
Unhand me!

33:08.369 --> 33:10.002
Calm down!

33:13.974 --> 33:15.774
Coming through, coming through!

33:23.651 --> 33:25.017
Hey, hey! Hey, hands off!

33:25.019 --> 33:26.385
Votes for women!

33:26.387 --> 33:29.955
Votes for women! Votes for women!

33:38.032 --> 33:40.199
- I totally had that.
- Yeah, sure you did.

33:40.201 --> 33:42.668
- He's almost inside.
- Let's go.

33:42.670 --> 33:44.105
Mr. President!

33:44.108 --> 33:47.039
Mr. President! Mr. President!

33:47.041 --> 33:48.277
Mr. President!

33:48.382 --> 33:50.642
Mr. President!

33:50.644 --> 33:52.054
Stop!

33:52.057 --> 33:55.475
This all has to stop!

33:55.478 --> 33:58.946
Someone else was supposed
to be up here today,

33:58.949 --> 34:03.287
someone whose voice needed to be heard.

34:03.290 --> 34:08.159
Someone who deserved justice.

34:08.161 --> 34:10.460
So now it falls to me to speak up.

34:10.463 --> 34:12.996
When we stay silent,

34:13.000 --> 34:17.802
we're just as much to blame
as those we fight against.

34:17.804 --> 34:20.505
And fight is what we must do!

34:20.507 --> 34:24.842
For how long can men
expect their sisters,

34:24.844 --> 34:26.545
their mothers,

34:26.547 --> 34:29.848
their wives, their
daughters to expect...

34:29.851 --> 34:34.388
To accept less than
what justice demands?

34:36.755 --> 34:40.257
Women's suffrage is inevitable.

34:40.261 --> 34:43.228
The time has come to allow women,

34:43.230 --> 34:44.763
all women,

34:44.764 --> 34:47.699
to have the voice we so greatly deserve.

34:47.701 --> 34:49.234
Lucy!

34:49.235 --> 34:52.337
The time is now!

34:52.339 --> 34:54.907
Now! Now!

34:57.578 --> 34:58.718
She did it!

34:58.779 --> 35:00.546
She did it.

35:00.548 --> 35:03.081
I think you did it.

35:03.084 --> 35:04.604
We got to go.

35:15.353 --> 35:16.919
- They just let you go?
- Had to.

35:16.921 --> 35:18.454
They knew if they
arrested me for speaking,

35:18.456 --> 35:20.489
they'd never be able to
ask for my help again.

35:20.491 --> 35:22.458
Well, for someone who
doesn't believe in speeches,

35:22.460 --> 35:24.927
you gave a pretty damn good one.

35:24.929 --> 35:26.228
Thank you, Grace.

35:26.230 --> 35:28.842
- I don't do hugs.
- Oh. Okay.

35:28.845 --> 35:30.181
I got to know.

35:30.184 --> 35:31.567
How'd you figure out who the killer was?

35:31.569 --> 35:32.802
The note the bellhop had was written

35:32.804 --> 35:35.126
by a woman and a leftie.

35:35.129 --> 35:37.039
A suffragette could've
easily planted the gun

35:37.041 --> 35:38.274
in Alice's room.

35:38.276 --> 35:39.942
Then I suggested they take a vote,

35:39.944 --> 35:41.610
and I watched how they voted.

35:41.612 --> 35:44.180
Only one woman raised
her left hand to vote:

35:44.182 --> 35:45.381
Charlotte.

35:45.383 --> 35:48.150
So I found her things and the gun.

35:48.152 --> 35:50.352
The rest was elementary.

35:53.991 --> 35:57.193
There's something very
strange about both of you.

35:57.195 --> 35:58.794
Where you're from.

35:58.796 --> 36:00.509
- Well...
- It's, uh...

36:00.512 --> 36:02.545
- We're...
- Canadians.

36:02.548 --> 36:05.249
No.

36:05.252 --> 36:07.519
I'll figure it out eventually.

36:07.522 --> 36:09.589
I'm sure you will.

36:09.592 --> 36:11.610
You're an idiot, you know that?

36:11.613 --> 36:13.329
Well, I'm alive, aren't I?

36:13.332 --> 36:14.748
And in a ridiculous amount of pain.

36:14.751 --> 36:16.011
A little help here, please?

36:16.013 --> 36:17.413
Oh, my God, Rufus, what happened to you?

36:17.415 --> 36:18.614
Can we just get out of here?

36:18.616 --> 36:20.015
Apparently, "invincible"

36:20.017 --> 36:21.852
doesn't mean what he thinks it means.

36:27.625 --> 36:29.325
They're back.

36:36.334 --> 36:38.767
- What happened to you?
- Cops.

36:50.715 --> 36:52.648
Hey. Come on.

36:57.688 --> 37:00.222
Who did you vote for
in the last election?

37:00.224 --> 37:01.391
Hillary Clinton.

37:05.463 --> 37:08.464
Hey, who's President?

37:08.466 --> 37:10.386
Donald Trump.

37:10.389 --> 37:13.290
Was that not supposed to happen?

37:13.293 --> 37:16.097
I don't know, but it wasn't us.

37:23.414 --> 37:26.015
So we've failed again,

37:26.017 --> 37:27.283
and Andre's dead.

37:27.285 --> 37:29.058
Flynn shot him.

37:29.061 --> 37:31.120
Honestly, it's a miracle
I was able to get away

37:31.122 --> 37:32.222
and save the Mothership.

37:34.257 --> 37:36.891
I would have done more, but...

37:36.894 --> 37:39.062
you wanted me to come back to you safe.

37:41.432 --> 37:43.499
Of course.

37:43.501 --> 37:45.199
That's all that matters.

37:45.202 --> 37:47.937
I've been working on some
ideas for our next mission.

37:51.041 --> 37:53.107
Later.

37:53.110 --> 37:54.743
Tell me later.

38:09.827 --> 38:11.211
Are you still working on this?

38:12.964 --> 38:15.965
Oh, yes. I got it.

38:15.967 --> 38:18.734
We definitely have something.

38:18.736 --> 38:20.636
Oh, there's nearly a gig of data here.

38:20.638 --> 38:23.806
Let's see what Rittenhouse
has been hiding.

38:43.127 --> 38:44.839
That's Jessica.

38:44.842 --> 38:46.775
What does this mean?

38:46.778 --> 38:49.346
I don't know yet.

38:49.349 --> 38:51.967
But until I do, this stays between us.

38:57.108 --> 38:58.540
- Ow!
- Sorry, sorry.

38:58.542 --> 39:00.109
I...

39:00.111 --> 39:02.511
Hey, you know what?

39:02.513 --> 39:06.515
Don't be. I kind of deserve it.

39:06.517 --> 39:11.053
I'm sorry about the way
I acted when you told me.

39:11.055 --> 39:12.721
I thought I could handle things myself,

39:12.723 --> 39:14.256
and look how I ended up.

39:14.258 --> 39:16.025
I get it.

39:16.027 --> 39:18.527
It can't be easy to hear.

39:18.529 --> 39:21.030
I know your visions are real.

39:21.032 --> 39:23.932
I just don't know what
I'm supposed to feel.

39:23.934 --> 39:26.068
What I'm supposed to do.

39:26.070 --> 39:27.870
I don't know either.

39:30.764 --> 39:33.732
But whatever it is,

39:33.735 --> 39:35.738
can we do it together?

39:38.882 --> 39:41.482
We can try.

39:41.485 --> 39:42.951
- Ow! Ow, ow, ow!
- Sorry.

39:42.953 --> 39:45.487
Don't touch.

39:45.489 --> 39:47.389
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

39:52.202 --> 39:53.735
Hey.

39:57.700 --> 39:59.500
Huh.

39:59.503 --> 40:01.905
Grace went on to become an
icon in the feminist movement.

40:03.307 --> 40:05.507
There's even a society
named after her, huh?

40:05.509 --> 40:07.577
Fighting for women's
rights to this very day.

40:11.782 --> 40:13.449
That's a good thing, right?

40:13.451 --> 40:16.518
Alice isn't even a footnote.

40:16.520 --> 40:18.887
She's gone, disappeared.

40:18.889 --> 40:22.224
Everything that she sacrificed,
all of her accomplishments.

40:22.226 --> 40:24.193
Like she never even
existed, and I'm the only one

40:24.195 --> 40:25.929
that's going to remember her.

40:28.299 --> 40:29.531
You're not the only one.

40:29.533 --> 40:31.534
Wyatt, don't. Don't.

40:33.637 --> 40:35.771
Lucy, I still care about you.

40:35.773 --> 40:37.306
I... I can't make that disappear.

40:37.308 --> 40:40.409
Wyatt, you are married
to a woman that you love.

40:40.411 --> 40:41.944
You are happily married.

40:41.946 --> 40:44.146
I have to accept that, and
you have to accept that.

40:44.148 --> 40:45.894
We can't keep living in the past.

40:49.487 --> 40:51.420
Okay, but Flynn, though?

40:51.422 --> 40:53.589
I mean, seriously.

40:53.591 --> 40:55.891
Wyatt, nothing happened.

40:55.893 --> 40:58.894
We talked. That's all.

40:58.896 --> 41:00.796
Cool.

41:00.798 --> 41:01.897
I mean, thank God.

41:01.899 --> 41:03.855
What?

41:03.858 --> 41:05.657
I think it's safe to
say that literally no one

41:05.659 --> 41:07.103
has experienced what
I'm going through...

41:07.105 --> 41:08.353
What we're going through right now.

41:08.355 --> 41:09.638
I know that.

41:09.640 --> 41:13.041
But you getting a second
chance with Jessica...

41:13.043 --> 41:16.253
That is the closest thing to
a miracle I have ever seen,

41:16.256 --> 41:18.447
and there is no way that I'm
getting in the middle of that.

41:18.449 --> 41:20.016
That is not who I am.

41:21.684 --> 41:24.452
For what it's worth,

41:24.455 --> 41:26.989
I'm glad you are who you are.

41:26.991 --> 41:28.724
Well, I'm no Alice Paul, so...

41:28.726 --> 41:32.566
No, you're Lucy Preston.

41:32.569 --> 41:34.903
That's pretty damn good.

41:42.339 --> 41:45.800
So where does that leave us?

41:45.803 --> 41:47.905
Same place as always.

41:50.821 --> 41:53.417
Kicking ass and saving the world.

41:56.213 --> 41:58.013
Yeah.
