00:30.395 --> 00:33.448
The world's a funny place, you know?

00:35.367 --> 00:39.454
They say a man ain't a man
'til he's found a purpose.

00:39.738 --> 00:41.892
Created a routine.

00:43.108 --> 00:46.079
Finds somethin' worth livin' for.

00:46.445 --> 00:51.651
Few years back commander-in-chief
put forth an initiative.

00:51.751 --> 00:56.056
Sumbitch claimed that the psychiatric
institutes across this great nation

00:56.156 --> 00:59.526
didn't have to honor
certain obligations no more.

00:59.826 --> 01:02.829
Not even to the folks
that gave their lives

01:02.929 --> 01:05.732
and bled for God's country.

01:05.982 --> 01:09.252
They say the American dream's dead.

01:09.352 --> 01:13.724
Well, sir, some folks might get mad...

01:14.823 --> 01:18.328
some folks might even wanna
take a little revenge.

01:20.345 --> 01:22.749
'Cause idle hands...

01:23.415 --> 01:27.988
well... they're the devil's playground.

01:28.987 --> 01:32.525
The Bible says so, so it must be true.

01:33.792 --> 01:35.696
But...

01:35.796 --> 01:37.980
either way...

01:38.080 --> 01:40.400
out here...

01:40.500 --> 01:43.136
there's one thing that's certain.

01:45.687 --> 01:48.558
God don't pick no favorites.

02:53.305 --> 02:55.475
Oh, no.

03:35.781 --> 03:39.124
No. Please stop. No, no, no!

03:53.865 --> 03:56.970
He fucking killed me and shot me, Joe!

03:57.270 --> 04:00.081
- I'm fuckin' dying, Joe.
- Nobody's dying in here.

04:00.181 --> 04:03.009
- They fuckin' killed me.
- They didn't kill you.

04:03.109 --> 04:06.179
- It's gonna hurt like hell but you're okay.
- He fuckin' killed me.

04:06.279 --> 04:09.715
- He fuckin' killed me! It fuckin' burns, Joe!
- They didn't kill you.

04:12.351 --> 04:16.956
Fuck, fuckin' just stop it!
It's all there, we did it, Lenny.

04:18.558 --> 04:21.761
Let me out of this fuckin' car, Joe!
We ain't gonna make it, man.

04:21.861 --> 04:26.300
- Hey, stop talkin' like that, you hear me?
- This wasn't fucking worth it, Joe.

04:28.201 --> 04:32.560
- We're sticking to the plan, Lenny!
- Can't feel nothing, Joe. I can't feel nothing!

04:32.660 --> 04:35.541
Just breathe. It's 'cause you're
not breathing, Lenny. Breathe.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.545
Breathe and talk to me.

04:43.398 --> 04:45.302
You feel that?

04:46.352 --> 04:48.922
Come on, now...

04:49.921 --> 04:52.525
Damn it, Lenny, just do it.

04:53.291 --> 04:57.763
I'm fucked. Oh, fuck.
I can't see shit, Joe.

04:57.863 --> 05:01.501
It's okay.
Just talk to me, talk to me, Lenny.

05:01.601 --> 05:04.871
Fuck, this wasn't worth it, Joe.

05:05.437 --> 05:08.241
This just wasn't fuckin' worth it.

05:09.308 --> 05:11.944
Stop talking like that, alright?

05:12.044 --> 05:14.180
I'm gonna get you to Darcy's.
He's gonna call his girl.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.383
The one with the veterinarian tattoo on her
ass and she's gonna fix you up, alright?

05:17.483 --> 05:21.291
Okay? She gonna set you straight, okay?

05:21.386 --> 05:23.656
Okay, Len?

05:26.525 --> 05:29.962
Len. Oh, God.

05:30.062 --> 05:32.298
Damn it, Len.

06:13.105 --> 06:14.908
Fuck!

06:20.712 --> 06:23.116
Let's go, buddy.

06:38.229 --> 06:40.533
- Get out.
- Please, please.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.869
Get out.

06:42.968 --> 06:46.305
Come on.
Get out of the goddamn car, sweetheart.

06:46.405 --> 06:48.174
Please don't hurt me.
Please, I'm begging you.

06:48.274 --> 06:51.010
Come on, come on, I need your help, okay?

06:51.110 --> 06:53.613
Okay? I need your help.

06:53.713 --> 06:57.550
- Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh, Jesus Christ!
- It's okay, it's okay.

06:57.650 --> 07:01.321
There's a first time for everything.
Come on. Come on.

07:03.272 --> 07:05.076
Hey!

07:06.726 --> 07:08.995
Fuckin' help me.

07:09.077 --> 07:11.748
Don't hurt me, I'll hurt you.

07:15.934 --> 07:18.805
Oh, shit. Just grab his other arm.

07:22.374 --> 07:25.144
Right, right here, alright?

07:25.244 --> 07:27.313
- Pick him up.
- Yeah.

07:27.413 --> 07:30.483
Come on, grab him. Grab him.

07:31.049 --> 07:34.287
Fuck! Fuck!

07:41.226 --> 07:45.765
- Come on back now, you hear?
- Please, you don't need me.

07:45.865 --> 07:48.805
- You heard me, woman.
- I'm begging you.

07:48.905 --> 07:51.738
- You see this? You see this?
- Just...

07:51.838 --> 07:56.208
Fear not, this is your Bible
and it's only got one verse.

07:56.308 --> 08:00.111
Do... not... run from me.

08:00.211 --> 08:02.523
You understand?

08:02.623 --> 08:05.518
- You understand?
- Yes.

08:05.550 --> 08:07.354
Good.

08:08.637 --> 08:11.808
Don't make me hurt you now, sweetheart.

08:15.226 --> 08:18.411
Come on. Let's go.

08:22.667 --> 08:25.238
You pull that again...

08:25.905 --> 08:28.408
that's how fucking easy it is.

08:46.391 --> 08:48.860
Fucking A.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.230
What do you think?

08:55.200 --> 08:59.171
I think every second we stall
another person joins that crowd.

08:59.271 --> 09:02.742
It's our time to shine, baby.
The world is ours.

09:03.042 --> 09:07.313
- It's our ticket, buddy.
- I'm not going back, Joe.

09:07.912 --> 09:11.717
You ain't going back, Lenny.
We ain't never going back.

09:11.817 --> 09:14.386
That's why we're doing this.

09:14.486 --> 09:18.791
Now, an old guard's immediately
to your left when you walk in.

09:18.891 --> 09:22.995
You gotta take him out fast.
Sock in the gut will do it.

09:23.895 --> 09:26.132
Don't kill him if you don't have to.

09:26.232 --> 09:29.469
- You ready?
- You sure about this?

09:33.672 --> 09:38.311
Yeah. It's now or never.
They're gonna get suspicious.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.814
Now, debt documents lie
right next to the money vault.

09:41.914 --> 09:46.118
I want you to stash as many as you can.
We'll be town heroes.

09:46.218 --> 09:49.050
Now them big corporate banks
send out those crazy motherfuckers

09:49.150 --> 09:52.892
to fetch their fucking stolen property.
Maybe these guys do it too, man.

09:52.992 --> 09:56.629
Maybe it's not worth it.
Maybe it's just not cool right now.

09:57.963 --> 10:00.566
That's all hogwash.

10:02.467 --> 10:06.072
We'll be long gone,
anyway by the time they get wind of this.

10:08.873 --> 10:11.169
- You ready?
- Fucking A, Joe. Fucking A, Joe.

10:11.269 --> 10:15.581
Fucking A, Joe. Fucking A, Joe!

10:16.384 --> 10:21.008
- Are you ready, Joe?
- Laissez le bon rule! Lenny!

11:05.196 --> 11:07.000
Ready?

11:08.828 --> 11:11.026
- Good afternoon, everybody.
- Get on the fucking ground!

11:11.126 --> 11:13.572
This here is a stick-up.

11:20.979 --> 11:22.214
Come on, let's roll him.

11:22.314 --> 11:25.017
- What?
- Now.

11:25.984 --> 11:28.721
Like your life depended on it, sweetheart.

11:29.121 --> 11:31.123
Come on.

11:40.665 --> 11:44.171
Okay. Hard part's over.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.538
Get in.

11:48.773 --> 11:50.409
No.

11:50.509 --> 11:53.979
You gonna make me fucking do this again.
I threw my best friend off the fucking cliff!

11:54.079 --> 11:55.981
- Just leave me.
- Get in the goddamn car!

11:56.081 --> 12:00.787
Get in the fucking car. Why are you
giving me such a hard time, huh?

12:01.753 --> 12:04.390
Let me get that for ya.

12:05.223 --> 12:06.593
Yeah.

12:07.293 --> 12:09.963
Worse than my fucking ex-girlfriend.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.569
Goddamn!

12:50.669 --> 12:53.405
Hotter than hell out here, ain't it?

12:53.505 --> 12:56.709
They say it gets hotter
the closer you get to Mexico.

12:58.276 --> 13:01.147
You ever been to Mexico, sweetheart?

13:02.313 --> 13:06.052
- No.
- Well, Mexico...

13:07.086 --> 13:10.790
It's a sight to see. They got men
down there that'll follow you around

13:10.890 --> 13:14.326
with guitars and trumpets
for a dollar a day.

13:14.426 --> 13:17.196
It's like your own private marchin' band.

13:17.296 --> 13:20.033
It makes things just...

13:21.532 --> 13:24.517
pleasant, just pleasant.

13:25.570 --> 13:28.039
I don't wanna go to Mexico.

13:28.139 --> 13:30.342
I wanna go home.

13:30.442 --> 13:32.244
I have to go home.

13:32.344 --> 13:35.848
Well, I'm afraid that's a no-can-do
type of situation, sugar.

13:35.948 --> 13:38.717
- We're on a tight schedule.
- You can just let me out here.

13:38.817 --> 13:41.353
We're... miles away from town.

13:41.453 --> 13:43.689
I won't tell anybody,
I don't even know your name.

13:43.789 --> 13:45.491
Joe Clay.

13:46.091 --> 13:48.060
Go on, take it.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.791
Then we ain't strangers no more.

13:52.664 --> 13:54.900
Oh, hell.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.179
Now you can see the predicament we're in.

13:57.279 --> 14:01.507
You know my name.
You know where we're goin'.

14:01.607 --> 14:04.243
I'd be a fool to let you out now.

14:06.711 --> 14:08.515
Coward.

14:11.065 --> 14:13.202
What's that?

14:13.652 --> 14:15.554
You think you're charming?

14:15.654 --> 14:20.025
You're a coward. What kind of man
would you be without that gun, huh?

14:20.125 --> 14:22.963
I know men like you, you only know
about Mexico 'cause you ran in there

14:23.063 --> 14:26.999
when your number got called up like
a little pussy with the tail between its legs.

14:27.099 --> 14:29.468
You're a disgrace.

14:44.515 --> 14:46.765
What men?

14:48.553 --> 14:51.824
Come on. I know you heard me. What men?

14:51.924 --> 14:55.627
You said you know men like me. What men?

14:55.727 --> 14:57.474
My brother.

14:58.029 --> 14:59.698
Is he a runner?

14:59.798 --> 15:04.503
He left us, me and my daddy...
with all the farm debt.

15:04.603 --> 15:07.573
My daddy's old. He got real sick.

15:07.673 --> 15:11.977
- That's a real sad story.
- It's not a story. It's true.

15:12.077 --> 15:15.330
Well, I ain't no fucking draft dodger,

15:15.430 --> 15:18.083
shit kicker like your
good-for-nothin' brother.

15:18.183 --> 15:20.186
You understand?

15:20.218 --> 15:23.255
They call me scorpion Joe in the pen.

15:23.555 --> 15:25.791
You know why?

15:27.175 --> 15:28.978
Why?

15:29.494 --> 15:32.431
Scorpion doesn't know why it sting.

15:32.531 --> 15:34.600
It just does.

15:34.700 --> 15:37.203
It's in its nature.

15:39.220 --> 15:42.825
You make me mad, I'll sting ya.

16:18.126 --> 16:20.701
You know, I gotta be some kind of sick...

16:31.789 --> 16:33.826
Stay down.

16:40.765 --> 16:43.068
You hear anything?

16:48.206 --> 16:53.334
No, no! Get off of me! You son of a bitch!

16:53.878 --> 16:56.449
Think this is a fuckin' game?

16:58.482 --> 17:00.886
Fucking cute, ain't it?

17:06.457 --> 17:09.461
No! No, no, no!

17:09.560 --> 17:12.231
Get that off of me.
Get that fucking thing off of me.

17:12.330 --> 17:14.198
Get it off of me!

17:14.298 --> 17:17.835
Help! Help!

17:18.470 --> 17:20.906
Get it off of me!

17:23.057 --> 17:25.627
Don't go nowhere now, you hear?

18:00.394 --> 18:04.416
Hey! You think you got me, huh?

18:04.516 --> 18:08.554
You think you could pitch Scorpion Joe?

18:08.654 --> 18:11.590
Come on, motherfucker,
I know you're there!

18:11.690 --> 18:16.067
You ain't getting the jump
on old Joe Clay. Not today.

18:16.167 --> 18:19.965
Scorpion Joe's the greatest
outlaw there ever was!

19:02.307 --> 19:04.042
Help!

19:04.142 --> 19:06.688
Jesus Christ!

19:34.973 --> 19:37.443
Don't kill me.

19:39.944 --> 19:42.381
How you doin'?

19:47.284 --> 19:49.689
What's goin' on here?

19:51.989 --> 19:54.760
He... he robbed a bank.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.927
You in trouble?

19:57.027 --> 19:59.631
Yes, yes, they kidnapped me.

19:59.731 --> 20:01.934
Kidnapped?

20:03.000 --> 20:07.371
- Now, please.
- This is private property, you know.

20:07.671 --> 20:10.509
- No.
- I had every right to shoot him.

20:10.609 --> 20:13.112
Don't you think so?

20:13.512 --> 20:15.714
Answer me.

20:15.913 --> 20:18.617
They took me. They took me, honest.

20:18.717 --> 20:21.219
I was at the bank in Mackin County
and they... they took me.

20:21.319 --> 20:23.754
I had nothing to do with this.

20:23.854 --> 20:26.058
What's that?

20:26.791 --> 20:28.994
I don't know.

20:33.998 --> 20:37.569
Alright, watch it now, miss. Back up.

21:05.696 --> 21:09.734
Suspect this is all a man's life
is worth nowadays, huh?

21:10.801 --> 21:14.406
Or is this split down the middle
between the two of ya?

21:14.738 --> 21:17.709
I didn't do anything wrong.

21:17.809 --> 21:20.645
That's all it's ever been about, girl!

21:20.745 --> 21:23.115
This shit!

21:23.215 --> 21:28.287
You ask anybody on this goddamn earth
and they ain't never done nothin' wrong.

21:33.457 --> 21:35.928
I just wanna go home.

21:38.696 --> 21:41.233
I just gotta get home.

21:41.632 --> 21:45.137
Can you help me? Please.

21:46.637 --> 21:49.474
- Anybody know you're out here?
- Yes.

21:49.574 --> 21:52.477
- Who?
- The sheriff.

21:59.617 --> 22:01.853
Wait here.

22:08.992 --> 22:10.796
Hey!

22:12.196 --> 22:15.063
I think the keys are... are here!

22:15.399 --> 22:18.837
Hey, I think the keys
are in his back pocket.

22:21.205 --> 22:23.509
What are you doing?

22:23.907 --> 22:25.026
What are you doing?

22:25.126 --> 22:27.662
I'm just gonna go ahead
and knock you out now, understand?

22:27.762 --> 22:29.565
No.

23:14.175 --> 23:17.779
Ms. Fontaine,
there's not much I can tell you.

23:17.879 --> 23:19.681
But you can't just do that.

23:19.781 --> 23:22.625
- You can't just let them come in and take it.
- Ms. Fontaine...

23:22.725 --> 23:26.588
We had a deal with Mr. Briggs.
It was an implied contract with the land.

23:26.688 --> 23:30.892
We've been living there for the last 85 years.
It's our home, that's our livelihood.

23:30.992 --> 23:32.964
He can't just walk in there
and kick us out!

23:33.064 --> 23:36.949
I would like to have a chance to explain.

23:37.698 --> 23:41.336
Okay, then, please. By all means.

23:41.436 --> 23:44.171
Well... First of all...

23:44.271 --> 23:46.928
the deal your father had
with Llewellyn Briggs

23:47.028 --> 23:48.947
is a matter between the two of them.

23:49.047 --> 23:51.379
It was a handshake.
It's not legally binding.

23:51.479 --> 23:55.917
Whether you pay for it or not,
the land belongs to Mr. Briggs

23:56.017 --> 23:58.386
and he can do with it as he pleases.

23:58.486 --> 24:01.756
That's why I was saying
if you could just approve this loan...

24:01.856 --> 24:04.593
With what collateral?

24:05.626 --> 24:07.929
If you could just approve this loan,

24:08.029 --> 24:11.399
we can buy the land from Mr. Briggs
and we can pay you back with the profit.

24:11.499 --> 24:14.769
Ms. Fontaine,
I'm gonna try to explain this

24:14.869 --> 24:19.174
in a way somebody like you can understand.

24:20.874 --> 24:24.279
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?
- There's no need to get vulgar.

24:24.379 --> 24:29.084
Somebody like me? Excuse me,
I'm not some uneducated hick.

24:29.184 --> 24:31.453
My family's farm is about
to be taken away from us.

24:31.553 --> 24:34.155
And you're saying that we
should just smile and thank them?

24:34.255 --> 24:36.825
- I didn't mean it like...
- No, no, no, let me say this in a way

24:36.925 --> 24:39.628
somebody like you can understand,
you son of a bitch.

24:39.728 --> 24:42.664
My father is sick. He's dying.

24:42.764 --> 24:45.967
How am I gonna support him
without our land?

24:46.067 --> 24:49.738
Well, there's always
the local burlesque house.

24:57.644 --> 25:01.182
Ms. Fontaine. Wait a minute.

25:01.282 --> 25:03.818
Ms. Fontaine, I...

25:43.257 --> 25:46.595
Ms. Fontaine, I'm... I'm very sorry.

25:46.695 --> 25:48.997
That was completely out of line.

25:49.097 --> 25:51.665
How are you gonna make it right?

25:52.100 --> 25:54.169
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Get on the fucking ground!

25:54.269 --> 25:56.371
This here's a stick-up.

27:26.393 --> 27:28.422
Help!

27:30.464 --> 27:32.546
Help!

29:18.872 --> 29:20.758
Fuck!

35:38.085 --> 35:40.321
Well, howdy.

35:41.489 --> 35:43.725
Now, Wyatt...

35:44.525 --> 35:47.295
I don't need this, do I?

35:47.395 --> 35:50.186
Don't make me angry, goddamn it.

35:51.348 --> 35:53.185
Okay.

36:00.674 --> 36:03.177
What you doing out here?

36:03.277 --> 36:04.812
Came to check up.

36:04.912 --> 36:09.584
That sand storm tore through here
days ago did damage as far as Terry.

36:10.184 --> 36:14.121
- Surprised you're still standin'.
- This ain't part of the agreement.

36:14.221 --> 36:16.091
Nope.

36:18.425 --> 36:20.896
I suppose it ain't.

36:23.597 --> 36:25.720
Then answer me.

36:28.335 --> 36:30.138
Well...

36:37.510 --> 36:39.495
Couple of fellas with rocks in their heads

36:39.595 --> 36:42.676
decided to hold up
the Farming Bank outside Mackin.

36:42.774 --> 36:44.051
What's that got to do with me?

36:44.151 --> 36:47.375
They were last seen drivin'
in this direction.

36:48.022 --> 36:49.724
They ain't here.

36:49.824 --> 36:54.228
These boys took old Tom Fontaine's
daughter with 'em.

36:55.463 --> 36:57.098
Not by her volunteer, of course.

36:57.198 --> 37:00.835
Don't know who Tom Fontaine is.
Don't know his girl, neither.

37:00.935 --> 37:03.003
She's local.

37:03.103 --> 37:05.806
Daddy's a dirt farmer out on six.

37:05.906 --> 37:09.344
Known 'em for quite a stretch,
everyone round here has.

37:10.010 --> 37:14.016
Folks are gonna start askin' questions
as soon as she don't turn up.

37:15.598 --> 37:20.091
Not much I can do for you
if they start lookin' in this direction.

37:26.226 --> 37:29.297
I think it's safe to say
that's your problem, not mine.

37:29.397 --> 37:31.966
Goddamn it, Wyatt.

37:32.932 --> 37:35.201
I tell you what, this place opens up,
it won't be long

37:35.301 --> 37:39.140
- after that I forget we're brothers.
- Don't come around here no more.

37:39.340 --> 37:42.777
- You seen her or not?
- I told you the first time!

37:42.877 --> 37:45.980
Well, it'd better be the truth, Wyatt,
'cause they'll burn you down otherwise.

37:46.080 --> 37:49.885
Brothers burn faster
when they're burnin' together.

38:02.262 --> 38:05.499
How far does a scream
travel out here, Wyatt?

38:05.599 --> 38:07.736
Not too far.

38:18.261 --> 38:20.598
Oh, yeah, one more thing...

38:20.698 --> 38:24.268
next time you pick up
a breakdown out on 66

38:24.368 --> 38:28.239
you might wanna make sure
they ain't been to a call box first.

38:28.389 --> 38:30.357
Yeah.

38:30.457 --> 38:34.795
Bureau still comes around from time to time
to see if those folks ever showed up.

38:34.895 --> 38:38.332
- What you tell 'em?
- What I know.

38:38.432 --> 38:40.235
Nothin'.

39:17.203 --> 39:20.421
I tell the truth. I'm a man of the law.
That's what I do.

39:20.521 --> 39:23.661
I know he had a goddamn gun out there.
We've always had guns in our family.

39:23.761 --> 39:26.550
Of course he had a gun out there.
He's living out in the middle of nowhere.

39:26.650 --> 39:29.899
Stop him from what?
I didn't know what he was doin'.

39:29.983 --> 39:32.854
What was I supposed to know he was doing?

39:41.628 --> 39:45.565
Wyatt. Wyatt Moss.

39:45.665 --> 39:48.136
I just can't believe it.

39:48.935 --> 39:51.572
Wyatt Moss, my brother.

39:51.672 --> 39:54.142
I just can't believe it.

39:54.774 --> 39:57.345
I'm an honest man.

40:07.488 --> 40:10.691
No, sir, I haven't seen Wyatt
in, I don't know...

40:11.357 --> 40:15.396
over a year, I don't know, closer to two.

40:15.828 --> 40:18.132
I'm an honest man.

40:27.140 --> 40:30.744
I'm a man of law, goddamn it!
I'm an honest man!

41:45.819 --> 41:47.922
Carla Jean?

41:48.288 --> 41:50.057
Yes, Sheriff?

41:50.157 --> 41:53.027
What was the description of those boys?

41:53.127 --> 41:55.429
Which boys was that, sheriff?

41:55.529 --> 41:56.964
Goddamn it.

41:57.064 --> 41:59.867
Now, which boys do you think?

42:00.767 --> 42:04.805
- The ones that holdup the farm bank, right?
- That's right.

42:04.905 --> 42:08.442
I thought you meant that Moss boy
that got caught up in Dreyer's Well.

42:08.542 --> 42:12.346
No, I meant them holdup boys.
Now was one of them a big fella?

42:12.746 --> 42:14.815
- How you mean?
- A great big sumbitch.

42:14.915 --> 42:16.784
That's what the reports say, right?

42:16.884 --> 42:21.722
Well, Mr. McDonnough described them
as a "goddamn monster."

42:21.822 --> 42:24.892
Sorry, Sheriff, but that's in the report.

42:27.660 --> 42:30.364
Put me through to Deputy Winston.

42:30.464 --> 42:32.933
Just a moment, Sheriff.

42:33.033 --> 42:35.636
Listen, now, Winston,
have you seen those guys?

42:35.736 --> 42:38.872
Winston, you seen those boys?
Winston, you seen...

42:38.972 --> 42:42.576
- Yes, sheriff.
- Yeah, Winston, any sign of those boys?

42:42.676 --> 42:45.546
No reported sightings on the interstate.

42:45.646 --> 42:47.982
Put up roadblocks
all the way up to Rowena.

42:48.082 --> 42:50.952
Expect to catch 'em any minute now.

42:54.087 --> 42:56.224
Yeah, I expect so too.

43:04.897 --> 43:06.734
Miss?

43:07.934 --> 43:09.804
Hello?

43:48.241 --> 43:52.146
What... wake up, wake up.
Wake up. Wake up.

43:52.246 --> 43:55.516
Where is he? Where is he?

44:01.120 --> 44:02.623
Tell me where he is? Where is he?

44:02.723 --> 44:06.627
We reached that station, San Diego.
We're friends.

44:06.677 --> 44:10.197
Okay, we gotta out of here. No, no, no,
wake up. Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

44:10.297 --> 44:14.405
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

44:14.505 --> 44:18.372
- Water.
- I... I don't have any water.

44:29.682 --> 44:33.854
Wake up. Wake up. My name is Vivian.
I'm gonna get you out of here, okay?

44:33.954 --> 44:38.625
I'm gonna get you out of here. Okay?
I'm gonna help. Alright?

44:38.725 --> 44:41.028
Just stay with me.

44:49.201 --> 44:51.405
Oh, great.

44:55.174 --> 44:57.401
- Rats.
- Wake up. Don't leave me.

44:57.471 --> 44:59.563
Don't leave me.

45:01.747 --> 45:04.885
Okay? We better get over that...

45:44.790 --> 45:46.994
Carla Jean.

45:48.427 --> 45:50.698
Carla Jean!

46:04.510 --> 46:06.200
Carla!

46:06.880 --> 46:08.686
Fuck!

46:10.683 --> 46:12.720
Wyatt!

46:15.354 --> 46:17.135
Wyatt!

46:19.325 --> 46:22.029
I'm coming in there!

46:22.129 --> 46:25.732
If you got that girl in there,
it's all over. You hear me?

46:25.832 --> 46:28.736
I can't do this anymore!

46:32.989 --> 46:34.826
Wyatt!

50:03.949 --> 50:06.020
Hello!

50:17.096 --> 50:19.133
Hello!

50:30.876 --> 50:32.947
Hello!

51:02.474 --> 51:06.413
Help! Help!

51:09.949 --> 51:13.921
Oh, please! Help!

51:34.240 --> 51:36.022
I'm here.

51:36.122 --> 51:39.213
Oh, God! Oh, please!

51:39.712 --> 51:43.984
Oh, God! Come please!
Hey! Hey, I can't move!

51:44.084 --> 51:48.188
I can't fucking move!
I can't fucking move! I can't!

51:48.288 --> 51:51.291
- Okay.
- Oh, God. Please just get it off!

51:51.391 --> 51:53.860
Get it off me!

51:56.262 --> 51:59.098
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

52:03.803 --> 52:07.741
- Fuck! Fuck!
- I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

52:09.441 --> 52:13.247
- No, no. Don't fucking leave me.
- Be right back.

52:14.046 --> 52:16.550
You fucking come back!

52:17.916 --> 52:20.192
Oh, God!

52:20.292 --> 52:24.125
- You there? You there?
- I'm coming.

52:26.558 --> 52:28.128
- Oh, God.
- Hold on, sir.

52:28.228 --> 52:30.696
Don't fucking leave me!

52:30.896 --> 52:34.268
Come back. Come back!

52:38.837 --> 52:41.608
Get it off me. Please just...

52:59.391 --> 53:02.963
- Can you move?
- What? No.

53:03.363 --> 53:05.665
- What's happening here?
- Some water?

53:05.689 --> 53:08.535
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

53:09.535 --> 53:12.439
Here. Here.

53:12.539 --> 53:15.609
Drink. Drink.

53:27.619 --> 53:31.518
We were just fucking...
We were coming from Colorado and...

53:31.618 --> 53:33.694
it was the whole band.

53:33.759 --> 53:38.698
And we got lost off the highway
and the van ran out of fucking gas.

53:38.798 --> 53:41.684
This guy said he would tow us
to the town and...

53:41.784 --> 53:44.818
then we woke up here instead.

53:45.938 --> 53:48.208
Oh, God, that was four days ago.

53:48.308 --> 53:52.045
- Four days?
- There were six of us.

53:52.145 --> 53:55.736
Over there, we...
we went over the ridge, we...

53:55.836 --> 53:59.151
we thought we were getting somewhere.

53:59.212 --> 54:02.922
And it's been a whole day since
we seen that fucking psychopath

54:03.022 --> 54:04.224
with the fucking mask.

54:04.324 --> 54:06.192
- A gas mask.
- Gas mask.

54:06.292 --> 54:11.398
We can get out of here. We can find help.
The nearest town can't be that far, right?

54:11.498 --> 54:14.147
There's a fucking electric fence

54:14.247 --> 54:18.588
50 feet high as far as you can see.

54:21.707 --> 54:25.645
We're fucking trapped here,
like an animal in a cage.

54:25.745 --> 54:27.463
Listen to me.

54:27.563 --> 54:29.809
I think I hurt him.

54:29.883 --> 54:33.720
I... I think I might have killed him.

54:35.220 --> 54:39.026
We can get out of here. We can find help.

54:42.027 --> 54:44.364
We're already fucking dead!

54:44.464 --> 54:46.766
No. No. No, you're not.

54:46.866 --> 54:49.302
Don't say that. No, you're not.

54:49.402 --> 54:52.405
You're gonna get help
and you're gonna come back, okay?

54:52.505 --> 54:54.174
- You just have to stay strong.
- Okay.

54:54.274 --> 54:56.742
- And I'm gonna be right back for you.
- Oh, please...

54:56.842 --> 54:58.825
- You have my word.
- Okay.

54:58.925 --> 55:01.881
- Here.
- Oh, thank you.

55:01.981 --> 55:03.416
- What's your name?
- I'm Travis.

55:03.516 --> 55:05.118
- Travis?
- Travis.

55:05.218 --> 55:07.954
- I'm Vivian.
- Hi, Vivian.

55:08.054 --> 55:10.524
I'll be right back.

55:23.502 --> 55:25.704
Help!

55:25.904 --> 55:27.708
Help!

55:28.107 --> 55:31.145
Anybody! Please!

57:59.658 --> 58:01.495
Hello?

58:40.565 --> 58:42.456
Help!

58:49.841 --> 58:52.145
I'll give it to ya.

58:52.245 --> 58:55.015
You roughed me up real nice.

58:58.517 --> 59:01.287
You better listen to me, pretty.

59:01.387 --> 59:03.857
I know you're there.

59:04.356 --> 59:07.724
You don't answer me,
I'm gonna burn down home base.

59:18.370 --> 59:23.043
You know what we used to do
when we needed info from the enemy quick?

59:23.341 --> 59:27.514
You... slide the edge of your knife

59:27.614 --> 59:32.086
in the soft bit between
the jaw bone and the ear.

59:33.285 --> 59:35.609
The pain is excruciating.

59:44.162 --> 59:46.633
You there, pretty?

59:48.133 --> 59:52.372
- Answer me, you fucking fuck!
- You can't do this!

01:00:02.114 --> 01:00:05.616
- What are you?
- What am I?

01:00:06.685 --> 01:00:08.889
I'm nobody.

01:00:15.127 --> 01:00:17.638
See you soon, bunny.

01:00:51.129 --> 01:00:52.566
Wyatt?

01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:40.733
Come on. Come on. Come on!

01:03:40.833 --> 01:03:43.403
Lock and load, boys.

01:04:02.454 --> 01:04:04.457
Come on!

01:04:17.703 --> 01:04:19.873
You missed!

01:04:20.171 --> 01:04:23.176
You missed, you son of a bitch!

01:04:23.276 --> 01:04:26.579
Come on. Come on and get me!

01:04:26.679 --> 01:04:28.649
Come in here and get me!

01:07:12.143 --> 01:07:15.081
Silver star, the third highest medal
in the country.

01:07:15.181 --> 01:07:19.118
It doesn't mean anything.
Lots of men died for these medals.

01:07:19.218 --> 01:07:21.887
Lieutenant Carwell died, so I got a medal.

01:07:21.987 --> 01:07:24.557
Sergeant Johns died, so I got a medal.

01:07:24.607 --> 01:07:27.693
I got a silver star, a purple heart,
and the rest of this garbage.

01:07:27.793 --> 01:07:30.297
It doesn't mean a thing!

01:08:19.810 --> 01:08:24.082
Motherfucker's down! I am your reckoning!

01:08:24.183 --> 01:08:27.752
And I will rain down fire upon you.

01:08:27.853 --> 01:08:30.189
We are ourselves.

01:08:30.288 --> 01:08:33.158
Their children. My children.

01:08:33.259 --> 01:08:36.462
Lock and load, boys! Roll up!

01:10:10.421 --> 01:10:12.925
Lock and load, boys.

01:10:13.692 --> 01:10:16.062
Motherfucker's down!

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:33.495
Help! Help!

01:11:55.893 --> 01:11:57.964
Help!

01:12:25.356 --> 01:12:27.227
No!

01:12:39.937 --> 01:12:41.741
Help!

01:14:29.847 --> 01:14:33.452
The world's a funny place.
The world's a funny place.

01:14:33.552 --> 01:14:36.989
The world is a funny place.
The world is a funny place.

01:14:37.089 --> 01:14:39.859
The world is a funny place.

01:14:44.395 --> 01:14:47.266
The world is a funny place.

01:14:48.299 --> 01:14:52.705
The world is a funny place.
The world is a funny place.

01:18:57.698 --> 01:19:01.244
Lock and load, boys! Roll up!
