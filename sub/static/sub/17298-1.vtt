00:23.382 --> 00:26.081
So, first off, thanks for
stopping by my blog...

00:28.647 --> 00:30.647
today, I'm with Tara Reiner.

00:30.648 --> 00:31.881
Hi everyone!

00:35.215 --> 00:36.880
She's just bought some
new clothes from the mall,

00:36.881 --> 00:38.380
and we're going to go
through each of them,

00:38.381 --> 00:39.547
and talk about them.

00:42.148 --> 00:45.449
This is my second favorite shirt...

00:59.780 --> 01:01.481
Are you okay?

01:47.781 --> 01:49.819
I just want to go home!

01:53.815 --> 01:55.415
If anyone is watching this, please!

02:38.514 --> 02:39.847
<i>Hey, you've reached Dan.</i>

02:39.848 --> 02:41.613
<i>Leave a message...</i>

02:41.614 --> 02:44.546
Dan, hey.
Where are you?

02:44.547 --> 02:46.014
I'm here.

02:46.015 --> 02:48.447
So when you get this,
give me a call back.

03:31.181 --> 03:33.746
Hey.

03:33.747 --> 03:34.613
<i>Hey.</i>

03:34.614 --> 03:36.546
Where are you?

03:36.547 --> 03:38.413
Um, I'm just at Rob's.

03:38.414 --> 03:40.513
Who's Rob?

03:40.514 --> 03:41.980
You actually don't know him.

03:41.981 --> 03:45.146
So, are you not coming to meet me?

03:45.147 --> 03:48.579
Uh, I'm gonna try a little
bit later, actually.

03:48.580 --> 03:50.645
<i>Who's that?</i>

03:50.646 --> 03:53.150
Uh, she's a friend of Rob's.

03:55.148 --> 03:57.814
Who's that girl that
posted on your page?

03:57.815 --> 03:59.814
What are you talking about?

03:59.815 --> 04:01.046
Why didn't you come
over last night?

04:01.047 --> 04:03.947
I need to talk to you in person.

04:03.948 --> 04:08.680
Um, I'm gonna try and come
over a little bit later, okay?

04:08.681 --> 04:10.579
<i>Can you please get off your phone?</i>

04:10.580 --> 04:11.778
Uh, one second...

04:11.779 --> 04:14.547
Dan, are you serious?

04:14.548 --> 04:17.378
<i>I have to tell you something.</i>

04:17.379 --> 04:18.713
It's cool.

04:18.714 --> 04:20.579
I'm sorry, what's cool?

04:20.579 --> 04:21.946
I feel like you want
to take a break.

04:21.947 --> 04:24.146
Okay, I get it.
I'm down with that.

04:24.147 --> 04:26.813
<i>I was actually thinking
about the same thing.</i>

04:26.814 --> 04:28.879
<i>It might do us both some good.</i>

04:28.880 --> 04:31.378
Look, I'll call you later.

04:31.379 --> 04:33.094
<i>Dan...</i>

05:34.448 --> 05:36.947
Happy New Year's Eve, everybody.

05:36.948 --> 05:39.346
I'm assuming that if you're here

05:39.347 --> 05:42.547
because you didn't do
very well on your finals.

05:42.548 --> 05:44.380
I don't want to be here either,

05:44.381 --> 05:46.913
but we've got to do this, okay?

05:46.914 --> 05:48.445
<i>So the first set of slides</i>

05:48.446 --> 05:50.612
<i>that we're going to
go right into now</i>

05:50.613 --> 05:52.180
is the Darrison Hotel crime scene.

05:53.179 --> 05:56.354
And this time, I suggest
everybody take some notes.

06:52.214 --> 06:53.716
<i>Sam, are you still there?</i>

06:55.714 --> 06:56.947
<i>Hello?</i>

06:56.948 --> 07:01.146
Hey, yeah. Sorry.
This kid just...

07:01.147 --> 07:03.680
<i>How's criminology?</i>

07:03.681 --> 07:05.559
I can't believe you had
class on New Year's Eve.

07:07.214 --> 07:09.480
Yeah, I don't know.
It was all right.

07:09.481 --> 07:12.179
Everyone I know
has two weeks off.

07:12.180 --> 07:13.545
All us medical undergrads are
working hard saving lives, okay?

07:13.546 --> 07:15.913
We deserve our time off.

07:15.914 --> 07:18.146
So you're coming tonight, right?

07:18.147 --> 07:20.146
<i>Be one to remember, I promise.</i>

07:20.147 --> 07:22.447
I don't know, Mark.

07:22.448 --> 07:23.812
I think I'm just gonna stay in.

07:23.813 --> 07:25.114
<i>I've had a rough day, so...</i>

07:26.113 --> 07:27.846
I know, I saw.

07:27.847 --> 07:28.606
<i>Of course you did.</i>

07:29.112 --> 07:31.850
Private life is public knowledge.

07:33.848 --> 07:35.513
I'll try to swing
by on my way home,

07:35.514 --> 07:38.115
but I can't stay all night.

07:53.514 --> 07:57.013
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

07:58.580 --> 08:00.146
<i>Happy New Year!</i>

08:33.914 --> 08:35.921
Hello?

08:41.914 --> 08:43.089
Guys...

08:52.080 --> 08:53.881
Ahh!

08:53.882 --> 08:54.713
Fuck!

08:54.714 --> 08:57.946
Oh, shit!

08:57.947 --> 09:00.379
Ah...

09:00.380 --> 09:02.580
Yup, m-hm.

09:02.581 --> 09:04.679
Yeah, you definitely broke my nose.

09:04.680 --> 09:05.559
Serves you right, Jed.

09:08.480 --> 09:09.445
All his idea.

09:09.446 --> 09:11.447
Glad you came, Sam.

09:23.147 --> 09:25.178
Sam...

09:25.179 --> 09:26.499
I hear you're back on the market.

09:37.080 --> 09:39.583
- I think you've had too much, baby.
- Shh...

09:41.581 --> 09:43.213
Hi, Sam!

09:43.214 --> 09:45.447
I don't think we've met.
I'm Kaitlin.

09:55.780 --> 09:58.814
Yeah, that really backfired.

09:59.813 --> 10:02.613
So... really single now?

10:07.747 --> 10:10.812
Anyways, I got 300
babe tickets here,

10:10.813 --> 10:12.414
fresh off the press.

10:21.714 --> 10:23.846
I'm gonna go hand these
out, you comin'?

10:23.847 --> 10:24.978
- Probably not.
- What?

10:24.979 --> 10:27.248
Fine then.
Anyone?

10:29.246 --> 10:31.415
Wait! Quick photo before
we're all hammered?

10:32.414 --> 10:33.616
I'm out.

10:36.613 --> 10:38.149
Yeah,
yeah... whoa.

10:42.847 --> 10:44.713
Cool, I'll link everyone.

10:44.714 --> 10:45.914
Uh, Sam...
I need to add you.

10:46.913 --> 10:49.347
- What's your last name?
- I deleted my account.

10:49.348 --> 10:50.181
Nice!

10:50.880 --> 10:52.647
Huh?

10:52.648 --> 10:55.713
Oh, so... how do you keep
in touch with people?

10:55.714 --> 10:58.912
I see them in person?

10:58.913 --> 11:00.445
Whatever, I'll link you anyway.

11:00.446 --> 11:02.582
Okay, say cheese.

12:12.314 --> 12:14.878
Your dad's in Spain?
I thought he was in Mexico.

12:14.879 --> 12:16.479
I don't know anymore.

12:16.480 --> 12:18.549
It's the last I heard from him.

12:20.547 --> 12:22.348
Same old, same old.

12:23.347 --> 12:24.480
So what happened with you and Dan?

12:24.481 --> 12:27.415
We broke up.
Guys suck.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.850
Just the ones you date.

12:32.847 --> 12:34.278
What sucks even more

12:34.279 --> 12:36.646
is that I feel like
everyone knew before me.

12:36.647 --> 12:38.145
People posting comments,

12:38.146 --> 12:40.246
judging me on the Social Redroom.

12:40.247 --> 12:42.612
Things no one would ever
say that to my face,

12:42.613 --> 12:45.045
but online it's so easy.

12:45.046 --> 12:47.712
Whatever.

12:47.713 --> 12:50.551
Sorry, I think I'm just tired.

12:54.547 --> 12:57.148
Further notice, please keep
windows and doors lock...

12:58.147 --> 13:00.812
And sites like MySocial,
and the Social Redroom

13:00.813 --> 13:02.373

view of the world!</i>

13:02.746 --> 13:04.445
These are theories,
they're conspiracy theories.

13:04.446 --> 13:05.679
I don't -
Where's the proof?

13:05.680 --> 13:07.345
<i>Show me the proof.</i>

13:07.346 --> 13:09.460
<i>It's social networking.

13:24.381 --> 13:26.580
What, are you filming this?

13:26.581 --> 13:29.179
Well, I figure one
day you'll be famous

13:29.180 --> 13:31.113
and we can release a sex tape.

13:31.114 --> 13:32.580
Make millions.

13:32.581 --> 13:34.112
And I can just, you know,

13:34.113 --> 13:35.212
live in a big house

13:35.213 --> 13:38.579
drinking champagne for breakfast.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.513
Right, right.

13:40.514 --> 13:43.113
Oh!
Not so fast.

13:45.879 --> 13:48.813
Well, you know,
I don't mind the teasing, but, um...

13:48.814 --> 13:51.911
I think we'll make
more millions if, uh...

13:51.912 --> 13:53.848
you're on the camera!

13:55.846 --> 13:58.347
What do you want me to do?

13:58.348 --> 13:59.715
What are you willing to do?

14:01.713 --> 14:03.145
I need some music.

14:38.313 --> 14:40.345
Today's incident has stirred
many painful memories

14:40.346 --> 14:41.266
of last month's suicide

14:41.679 --> 14:43.580
of 22-year old Cal Spencer

14:43.581 --> 14:45.546
who took his life
after bullying messages

14:45.547 --> 14:47.745
were posted on the
popular media site,

14:47.746 --> 14:49.580
the Social Redroom Inc.

14:49.581 --> 14:52.745
This leaves two more students
dead after today's events.

14:52.746 --> 14:55.012
Mark...

14:55.013 --> 14:56.449
Mark!

14:58.447 --> 15:00.179
I don't know,

15:00.180 --> 15:01.346
I feel like I just want to get
away for a while, you know?

15:01.347 --> 15:02.147
Maybe just transfer.

15:02.613 --> 15:04.445
Seriously?
Because of Dan?

15:04.446 --> 15:06.413
It's not just because of Dan.

15:06.414 --> 15:07.845
<i>Mark!</i>

15:07.846 --> 15:09.045
I don't get you sometimes.

15:09.046 --> 15:10.979
You're always takin' off.

15:10.980 --> 15:13.146
Why don't you just
stop for a second

15:13.147 --> 15:16.346
and try and sort it out?

15:16.347 --> 15:18.112
I could help you.

15:18.113 --> 15:20.380
<i>Yo, Marky!</i>

15:20.381 --> 15:22.882
Would you just go see
what he's yelling about?

15:23.881 --> 15:25.587
Yeah.

15:32.580 --> 15:34.179
- What do you want, Jed?
- Look...

15:34.180 --> 15:37.213
At approximately 4pm today,

15:37.214 --> 15:39.112
police shot and killed
Jeremy Dubrowsky,

15:39.113 --> 15:41.911
a two-year computer science
student at Kindred College.

15:41.912 --> 15:44.112
This occurred immediately
following at attack by Dubrowsky

15:44.113 --> 15:44.912
on another student,

15:44.913 --> 15:46.480
yet to be identified.

15:46.481 --> 15:49.145
Both students were pronounced
dead at the scene.

15:49.146 --> 15:50.613
Police have yet to determine
Dubrowsky's motive

15:50.648 --> 15:51.927
for attacking his fellow student,

15:52.579 --> 15:56.046
however, early reports say
Dubrowsky was a recent target

15:56.047 --> 15:57.345
of cyberbullying.

15:57.346 --> 15:58.779
I saw that guy today.

15:58.780 --> 16:01.146
This is just one of
four similar incidents

16:01.147 --> 16:03.879
that have happened in the area
in the last few hours.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.912
Although the official
causes are yet unknown,

16:05.913 --> 16:08.380
police say the recent
increase of cyberbullying

16:08.381 --> 16:09.957
may have played a role.

16:20.946 --> 16:23.812
Ugh, come on, dude,
you're still in your dorm?

16:23.813 --> 16:25.012
Have you seen what's going on?

16:25.514 --> 16:26.952
About the student?
Yeah, it's brutal.

16:27.512 --> 16:29.048
Yeah, well, that's not the
only thing that's happening.

16:29.547 --> 16:30.978
<i>There's cops everywhere,</i>

16:30.979 --> 16:32.313
<i>and the entire residence
is on lock-down.</i>

16:32.512 --> 16:34.412
<i>Okay, answer this.</i>

16:34.413 --> 16:37.454
There's something you gotta hear.

16:44.447 --> 16:47.380
Listen...

16:49.846 --> 16:53.382
Dude... dude,
what was that?

16:57.247 --> 16:58.812
I've been hearing
that for the last hour.

16:58.813 --> 17:01.246
It's creepy as hell.

17:01.247 --> 17:02.913
They're telling us to
keep our doors locked.

17:02.914 --> 17:04.246
I'm gonna send you some footage...

17:04.247 --> 17:05.944
stuff that they're
not showing on TV.

17:05.945 --> 17:06.980
All right, well,
just get over here quick, man,

17:06.981 --> 17:08.922
where it's safe.

17:17.913 --> 17:20.445
Reports are coming in from
all across the country.

17:20.446 --> 17:23.846
We urge people to stay indoors,
and not let anyone in.

17:23.847 --> 17:26.246
Following the violent deaths

17:26.247 --> 17:27.811
of three students
at Kindred College,

17:27.813 --> 17:29.246
more details are coming

17:29.247 --> 17:30.911
of similar incidents
across the country.

17:30.912 --> 17:32.347
Various student suicides
and physical attacks

17:32.447 --> 17:34.979
in Burbank, Washington
have now been reported.

17:34.980 --> 17:38.845
Authorities are now urging
people to stay indoors

17:38.846 --> 17:41.347
and to not let any strangers
inside their homes.

17:41.348 --> 17:43.312
As more reports flood in
from around the world,

17:43.313 --> 17:46.711
we at CCAC News will
continue our coverage.

of these and other events.

17:54.348 --> 17:55.813
The lights were flickering,

17:55.814 --> 17:57.545
and I think that it's
whenever they come near,

17:57.546 --> 17:59.345
like, they do something weird
to the electricity or something.

18:43.646 --> 18:45.678
They're telling everyone
to lock all the doors.

18:45.679 --> 18:47.745
The news said the same thing.

18:47.746 --> 18:49.414
Yeah, um...

18:50.413 --> 18:52.045
About that...

18:52.046 --> 18:54.245
We're throwing a kick-ass
New Year's party here tonight.

18:54.379 --> 18:57.579
Anyone see the problem
with not letting people in?

18:57.580 --> 18:59.012
I mean,

18:59.013 --> 19:01.145
what if the world really
is ending at 12:01?

19:01.146 --> 19:05.579
What if this the year it
finally all just... stops?

19:05.580 --> 19:08.146
Don't you want to go
out with some style?

19:08.147 --> 19:09.380
The world isn't ending, Jed.

19:10.379 --> 19:12.845
The media hypes these
events, you know that.

19:12.846 --> 19:14.046
All right, well, what
if it's terrorists?

19:14.345 --> 19:16.790
Jed, it's not terrorists.

19:26.780 --> 19:28.651
I don't see anything.

19:33.646 --> 19:35.881
Sam!

19:44.913 --> 19:48.612
<i>♪ It's time to
stand up and go now ♪</i>

19:48.613 --> 19:50.132
<i>♪ Better be ready
for the showdown... ♪</i>

19:57.512 --> 20:01.082
This... is definitely better
than the party downstairs.

20:05.780 --> 20:07.446
What was that?

20:08.846 --> 20:11.048
What the fuck?

20:13.046 --> 20:15.080
Hey!

20:17.679 --> 20:19.198
You've got two seconds
to get out, man!

20:20.913 --> 20:21.612
Steve!

20:21.613 --> 20:24.080
I said get out!

20:39.646 --> 20:40.388
Steve?

20:56.445 --> 20:57.548
Steve...

20:59.546 --> 21:01.431
What was he doing?

21:20.412 --> 21:21.921
He attacked me.

21:29.913 --> 21:31.528
He didn't mean to do it.

21:47.512 --> 21:48.911
Did you do that?

21:48.912 --> 21:50.913
It was an accident, okay?

21:50.914 --> 21:52.578
He smashed through the door,

21:52.579 --> 21:54.078
and then Steve had to push him out,

21:54.079 --> 21:55.378
and he tripped and he
fell off the balcony.

21:55.379 --> 21:56.644
Is he dead?

21:56.645 --> 21:59.378
He looks pretty fucking dead.

21:59.379 --> 22:01.611
Oh my god.

22:01.612 --> 22:03.113
I barely touched him.

22:03.114 --> 22:06.245
I told him to leave!

22:06.246 --> 22:09.146
It looks like they're
calling the cops, now...

22:09.147 --> 22:11.378
- I think we call 9-1-1 right now!
- No!

22:11.379 --> 22:14.948
It will look better if it
comes from us, all right?

22:15.947 --> 22:18.911
Someone tried to get
in downstairs too.

22:18.912 --> 22:21.345
Something's go on, Steve!

22:21.346 --> 22:23.845
Yeah, they've been telling
us not to let anyone in.

22:23.846 --> 22:25.944
- He's dead!
- Someone tried to grab Sam!

22:25.945 --> 22:29.816
And the news was saying
that we can't let anyone in!

22:33.812 --> 22:37.180
Guys...
Listen.

22:38.179 --> 22:39.911
<i>Due to the high volume,</i>

22:39.912 --> 22:41.678
<i>we cannot receive
calls at the moment.</i>

22:41.679 --> 22:45.578
<i>We strongly urge you to remain
calm, lock your premises,</i>

22:45.579 --> 22:46.611
<i>and do not let anyone</i>

22:46.612 --> 22:49.211
<i>in or out of your homes.</i>

22:49.212 --> 22:51.180
I've never heard a message
like that before.

22:52.179 --> 22:54.747
9-1-1 isn't supposed to
have an answering machine!

22:55.746 --> 22:57.712
We've got to go down.

22:57.713 --> 22:59.349
It'll be okay.

23:11.578 --> 23:13.949
Get the lights!

23:16.946 --> 23:18.581
Mark, what are you doing?

23:20.579 --> 23:23.048
What the fuck are they shooting at?

23:26.380 --> 23:27.513
Quiet!

23:30.846 --> 23:32.578
No one gets in, right?

23:32.579 --> 23:34.845
Yeah, well, that's what they said.

23:37.046 --> 23:39.212
Mark, man...

23:39.213 --> 23:40.511
There's a lot of people outside.

23:40.512 --> 23:42.480
Jed, the lights!

23:45.280 --> 23:46.779
Steve, you sure
picked the right night

23:46.780 --> 23:48.611
to throw a dude out the window.

23:48.612 --> 23:49.578
Okay, okay, just
keep the lights off

23:49.579 --> 23:52.948
and try to be quiet.

23:53.947 --> 23:55.046
Shit!

24:01.613 --> 24:03.679
This is gonna keep happening!

24:03.680 --> 24:04.911
We've got to barricade this place!

24:04.912 --> 24:06.112
Windows, doors, everything!

24:07.111 --> 24:08.845
It's okay.

24:08.846 --> 24:10.582
We need to do it now!

24:14.345 --> 24:16.177
Turn your phone off!

24:16.178 --> 24:18.545
<i>More than a thousand,
and the numbers...</i>

24:18.546 --> 24:20.210
Check the back door.

24:20.211 --> 24:21.844
<i>People infected seem to be getting</i>

24:21.845 --> 24:23.845
<i>increasingly aggressive,
angry, violent.</i>

24:23.846 --> 24:25.512
<i>Violent outbreaks
have been reported</i>

24:25.513 --> 24:27.177
<i>across the United States...</i>

24:27.178 --> 24:29.179
<i>the lives of 27 as
the police try...</i>

24:29.180 --> 24:31.411
<i>A biological terrorist
attack on New York</i>

24:31.412 --> 24:33.012
<i>leaving hundreds dead...</i>

24:33.013 --> 24:35.111
<i>Bangkok, as infection spreads...</i>

24:40.912 --> 24:43.446
<i>it's a mutation
of H1N1 virus...</i>

24:51.212 --> 24:52.611
<i>keep windows and doors covered,</i>

24:53.012 --> 24:54.912
<i>and please report any
signs of the infection.</i>

24:54.913 --> 24:57.178
<i>The fastest viral
infection ever reported</i>

24:57.179 --> 24:58.945
<i>has now claimed more
than a thousand,</i>

24:58.946 --> 25:00.912
<i>and the numbers are
continuing to rise.</i>

25:00.913 --> 25:02.912
<i>A biological terrorist
attack on New York</i>

25:02.913 --> 25:05.512
<i>leaving hundreds dead...</i>

25:33.513 --> 25:36.414
<i>Leave this child now!</i>

25:40.179 --> 25:42.713
<i>Leave this body!</i>

27:08.613 --> 27:10.655
Hello?

27:36.713 --> 27:38.145
Oh my god.

27:38.146 --> 27:40.945
It says Jeanette was
arrested for murder.

27:45.045 --> 27:46.351
Babe?

27:52.345 --> 27:54.658
What's wrong?

28:06.646 --> 28:08.911
I'm sending you a video link now.

28:08.912 --> 28:11.878
It's basically a
list of the symptoms.

28:11.879 --> 28:14.178
It's disturbing, but it's a list.

28:14.179 --> 28:16.579
Judging by the time
the post was sent,

28:16.580 --> 28:17.978
I'd say the girl got sick sometime

28:17.979 --> 28:20.612
before the reports
started coming out.

28:20.613 --> 28:23.512
I gotta ask you something.

28:23.513 --> 28:24.978
Do you think this is it?

28:24.979 --> 28:26.781
Do you think this is
the end of the world?

28:27.780 --> 28:29.178
I don't know, man.

28:29.179 --> 28:31.015
Sure as shit hope not.

28:33.013 --> 28:34.182
Yeah.

28:37.179 --> 28:39.647
<i>Thanks for
stopping by my blog -</i>

28:40.646 --> 28:41.545
Guys...

28:45.846 --> 28:47.177
Thanks for stopping by my blog.

28:47.178 --> 28:49.379
And don't forget to
follow our videos

28:49.380 --> 28:51.911
on the Bloggernaut,
and the Social Redroom.

28:51.912 --> 28:53.712
Today I'm with Tara Reiner.

28:53.713 --> 28:54.910
<i>Hey, everyone!</i>

28:54.911 --> 28:57.212
Why are we watching this?

28:57.213 --> 28:58.955
Just keep skipping
through it, okay?

29:09.944 --> 29:12.679
Oh my god!

29:25.413 --> 29:27.178
<i>Now go to when she's sitting back</i>

29:27.179 --> 29:29.149
<i>in front of the web cam...</i>

29:32.146 --> 29:35.679
<i>Her ears and her
nose started bleeding.</i>

29:35.680 --> 29:38.378
She said she was seeing things,

29:38.379 --> 29:40.348
and she was crying.

29:42.346 --> 29:44.978
I'm too scared to leave.

29:44.979 --> 29:49.211
<i>I'm trying to be as
quiet as possible</i>

29:49.212 --> 29:51.912
<i>because I hear people outside</i>

29:51.913 --> 29:55.612
and they sound like her.

29:55.613 --> 29:57.878
Whatever she had,

29:57.879 --> 30:00.945
I think it's happening to me.

30:00.946 --> 30:07.378
I'm seeing things too
and they're so real...

30:07.379 --> 30:09.777
Is there anyone watching?

30:09.778 --> 30:12.345
Anyone, please!

30:12.346 --> 30:13.849
<i>Help me!</i>

30:17.845 --> 30:20.379
I can't go any further.

30:20.380 --> 30:21.619
That's 'cause you're caught up.

30:21.678 --> 30:23.145
What you're watching now is live.

30:23.146 --> 30:24.912
I've watched this
a couple times now.

30:24.913 --> 30:26.991
Ears and nose bleeding seems
to be the first symptom.

30:29.246 --> 30:31.446
Shit, I gotta go.
I'll call you right back.

30:32.445 --> 30:34.077
Can we message her?

30:34.078 --> 30:37.446
Yeah, we can send her a
video chat request, I guess.

30:39.545 --> 30:41.412
Mark, get over here.

30:41.413 --> 30:43.462
Quick! Quick!

30:58.447 --> 31:00.477
- Tara?
- Hello?

31:00.478 --> 31:03.547
My name is Sam.
Are you okay?

31:04.546 --> 31:07.811
No, I don't think so.

31:07.812 --> 31:09.911
<i>Can you help me?</i>

31:09.912 --> 31:12.913
Where are you?
What's your address?

31:14.911 --> 31:17.110
I...

31:17.111 --> 31:18.177
I don't...

31:18.178 --> 31:21.045
I don't know.

31:21.046 --> 31:21.810
It's not my home.

31:21.811 --> 31:24.944
Do you have a phone?

31:24.945 --> 31:26.178
Tara?

31:26.179 --> 31:28.587
What's happening?

31:40.779 --> 31:43.479
Yeah, there's definitely
someone outside.

31:50.846 --> 31:51.646
- Hello?
- Chad?

31:52.645 --> 31:53.878
The door's locked,
give me a second!

31:53.879 --> 31:54.612
Mark! Mark!
Wait!

31:55.611 --> 31:57.445
Stop! Stop!

31:57.446 --> 31:59.112
Okay, look!
Look!

31:59.113 --> 32:00.580
Please look...

32:02.578 --> 32:04.745
Guys, it's Chad.

32:04.746 --> 32:06.845
<i>You've got to let me in.</i>

32:06.846 --> 32:09.778
<i>Quick, there's nobody
out here right now.</i>

32:09.779 --> 32:12.114
<i>Look, you've got to
let me in now, please.</i>

32:13.113 --> 32:14.512
Please let me in.

32:14.513 --> 32:15.177
Is that Chad?

32:15.178 --> 32:17.444
Yes.

32:17.445 --> 32:18.177
Are you gonna let him in?

32:18.178 --> 32:20.144
No.

32:20.145 --> 32:22.580
He has the symptom, man.

32:23.579 --> 32:25.711
Okay?

32:25.712 --> 32:27.512
We just watched a video.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.743
First symptom,
you start seeing shit.

32:29.744 --> 32:31.211
Hallucinations, I guess.

32:31.212 --> 32:33.710
Then your nose and your
ears start to bleed.

32:33.711 --> 32:35.714
Just wait, wait!
Wait.

32:37.712 --> 32:39.710
How do we know it's the
same thing as the video?

32:39.711 --> 32:40.710
- I have to open the door.
- No.

32:40.711 --> 32:44.411
Mark, I can hear you.

32:44.412 --> 32:45.844
<i>You can't do this, man.</i>

32:45.845 --> 32:47.845
You don't know what
it's like out here.

32:47.846 --> 32:51.378
We're not supposed to
let anyone in, remember?

32:51.379 --> 32:52.846
Steve, a little help?

32:54.844 --> 32:56.479
How do you actually know
someone's sick, Jed?

32:56.480 --> 32:58.378
Guys, it's Chad!

32:58.379 --> 33:01.446
Yeah, hey...

33:01.447 --> 33:03.910
His nose is bleeding, man.

33:03.911 --> 33:07.678
His freaking ears are bleeding!

33:07.679 --> 33:09.843
I love Chad, all right?
I really do.

33:09.844 --> 33:11.777
But I'm not going to die in here.

33:11.778 --> 33:12.977
Chad, just a second!

33:12.978 --> 33:15.778
They're everywhere.
Look...

33:15.779 --> 33:16.978
You gotta let me in now, okay?

33:16.979 --> 33:19.745
Where else is he gonna go?

33:21.746 --> 33:23.550
Mark wait!
Stop! Stop!

33:28.545 --> 33:29.945
He's sick.

33:29.946 --> 33:35.354
He is sick, man.
Okay?

33:44.346 --> 33:45.981
I'm sorry, Chad.

33:47.979 --> 33:48.948
What?

33:51.645 --> 33:53.681
I can't let you in.

33:55.679 --> 33:57.844
<i>Mark, you gotta
fucking let me in, man.</i>

33:57.845 --> 34:00.344
Go to a hospital, Chad, please!

34:00.345 --> 34:04.113
- You've got to fuckin' let me in!

34:05.112 --> 34:08.743
Dude, let me in, please!

34:08.744 --> 34:10.743
<i>I'm gonna fuckin' die out here.</i>

34:10.744 --> 34:12.446
<i>I'm gonna fuckin' die.</i>

34:14.444 --> 34:17.060
Fuckin' assholes.

34:31.045 --> 34:32.578
No help here?

34:32.579 --> 34:34.379
<i>He almost fuckin' let him in, man!</i>

34:34.380 --> 34:38.045
What the fuck am I
supposed to do, Jed?

34:38.045 --> 34:39.733
Fuck!

35:01.711 --> 35:02.944
I couldn't help him.

35:02.945 --> 35:07.711
Mark...
Mark, look at me.

35:07.712 --> 35:10.645
Mark, please, look at me.
Hey...

35:10.646 --> 35:13.089
I don't know what
I could have done.

35:22.080 --> 35:25.347
You okay?

35:34.411 --> 35:35.712
I don't have it.

35:35.713 --> 35:37.579
Whatever that is, I don't have it.

35:38.578 --> 35:40.177
Sam, you just threw up.

35:40.178 --> 35:43.421
I'm okay, Mark.

35:52.412 --> 35:54.714
We'll figure this out, okay?

35:56.712 --> 35:59.077
I won't tell anyone in the house.

35:59.078 --> 36:00.418
I'm not sick.

36:07.411 --> 36:08.414
I'm pregnant.

36:11.411 --> 36:13.782
What?

36:16.779 --> 36:18.410
I'm pregnant, Mark.

36:18.411 --> 36:20.676
That's why I came here.

36:20.677 --> 36:22.820
To tell you, I guess.

36:29.813 --> 36:30.978
I don't know what
I'm gonna do about it.

36:30.979 --> 36:34.879
About it...
Wait.

36:34.880 --> 36:36.146
Sam...

37:28.345 --> 37:30.212
- I had to leave my floor!
- Why, what's happening?

37:30.213 --> 37:32.376
- I don't know.
- Are you okay?

37:32.377 --> 37:33.844
Yeah, I'm fine.

37:33.845 --> 37:35.677
They just keep telling
us to move up one floor.

37:35.678 --> 37:37.212
It's like fucking Russian
Roulette in here.

37:37.213 --> 37:39.778
- I'm fine though.
- All right, good.

37:39.779 --> 37:42.416
<i>- Jed, I'm gonna have
to call you back!</i>

37:47.411 --> 37:49.643
<i>Hey, you've reached Chad
Wilson, leave me a message.</i>

37:49.644 --> 37:52.443
Hey, Chad, it's me again.

37:52.444 --> 37:56.477
Please... call me back, man.

37:56.478 --> 37:57.277
Okay?

38:29.245 --> 38:32.147
There are so many
posts of people dying.

38:34.145 --> 38:37.644
Half of my friends
aren't responding...

38:37.645 --> 38:40.378
Or their messages
don't make any sense.

38:40.379 --> 38:41.212
I just...

38:42.211 --> 38:44.384
I just don't know how
this many people can die.

40:08.913 --> 40:10.581
What the hell was that?

40:12.579 --> 40:13.912
Are you okay?

40:13.913 --> 40:16.981
Yes.

40:18.979 --> 40:22.763
I think I need to lay down.

40:39.746 --> 40:41.710
I think we need to
keep an eye on her.

40:41.711 --> 40:43.427
That's got to be one of the symptoms.

41:01.479 --> 41:02.711
What is she doing?

41:02.712 --> 41:04.443
She must have got
whatever it is

41:04.444 --> 41:05.811
from that other girl.

41:05.812 --> 41:07.177
I mean, this must
be what happens next.

41:07.178 --> 41:09.378
First you're nose
and your ears bleed...

41:09.379 --> 41:10.944
What happens, you get violent?

41:10.945 --> 41:14.744
Yeah, violent, you start
acting crazy, I don't know.

41:14.745 --> 41:16.365
I can't watch this.

41:36.345 --> 41:37.786
You okay?

41:45.778 --> 41:47.446
I wonder if I have it.

41:49.444 --> 41:50.377
How could you have gotten it?

41:50.378 --> 41:53.788
You can't be sick.

42:02.779 --> 42:05.344
I need help, Mark.

42:05.345 --> 42:06.578
Steve...

42:06.579 --> 42:08.394
What are you talking about?

42:23.379 --> 42:26.444
Something bad...

42:26.445 --> 42:28.544
is gonna happen.

42:28.545 --> 42:30.548
Steve, you're just being paranoid.

42:32.546 --> 42:34.376
Take care of Kait.

42:34.377 --> 42:35.143
Steve...

42:35.144 --> 42:37.511
Okay?

42:37.512 --> 42:39.448
I'm sorry.

42:42.445 --> 42:44.087
I'm sorry.

42:52.079 --> 42:53.679
Mark?

43:01.144 --> 43:02.912
<i>You're not safe, Steve.</i>

43:02.913 --> 43:04.643
Mark...

43:04.644 --> 43:06.844
<i>When it happens,
it will be so rapid.</i>

43:06.845 --> 43:08.713
<i>So fast it won't matter.</i>

43:10.711 --> 43:11.778
<i>They're trying to stop it.</i>

43:11.779 --> 43:13.377
I don't want to hurt them.

43:13.378 --> 43:17.720
<i>Don't fight it, Steve.
It's already happened.</i>

43:31.145 --> 43:34.711
Did you see?

43:34.712 --> 43:37.110
Just now?

43:37.111 --> 43:38.846
They were just here!

43:39.845 --> 43:41.177
Steve, what did you see,
you're scaring me.

43:41.178 --> 43:44.678
Stay away!

43:44.679 --> 43:46.648
Stay... away!

43:49.645 --> 43:51.310
He's infected.

43:51.311 --> 43:54.211
<i>- Jed, we don't know that!
- Yeah...</i>

43:54.212 --> 43:57.044
Come on, man.
I mean, look at him!

44:24.144 --> 44:26.446
Steve!

44:27.445 --> 44:29.547
Kaitlin, get back!

44:35.978 --> 44:38.445
Mark!

44:43.712 --> 44:45.577
No, no!
Steve! Steve!

44:45.578 --> 44:47.619
Mark!

45:06.911 --> 45:09.814
Steve! Steve!
No!

45:12.811 --> 45:15.593
No!

45:31.679 --> 45:34.380
I couldn't stop it.

45:42.177 --> 45:44.417
You need to get away.

45:49.412 --> 45:50.171
Look at your hands.

45:54.977 --> 45:58.724
Mark, you need to get away!

46:17.178 --> 46:20.584
Here, use this.
Put your hands...

46:27.577 --> 46:29.578
Mark, whatever this is...

46:29.579 --> 46:31.579
It's inside now.

46:32.578 --> 46:34.044
Mark...

46:34.045 --> 46:35.947
Mark...

46:37.945 --> 46:40.578
That wasn't Steve, all right?

46:40.579 --> 46:43.081
I mean,
we can agree on that, right?

46:46.078 --> 46:47.478
Mark...

46:47.479 --> 46:50.346
Whoa, where are you going?

46:51.345 --> 46:52.915
We're not leaving him there.

46:55.912 --> 46:57.378
Fine.

46:57.379 --> 46:59.538
But we're not touching him
unless we're wearing gloves.

47:37.744 --> 47:41.377
We have to figure out what to do.

47:41.378 --> 47:44.163
I can't stay here.

48:04.878 --> 48:07.953
- Mark!
- Oh fuck.

48:15.945 --> 48:18.582
I knew she was sick.

48:21.579 --> 48:23.843
No! No!
She did it, she hit me!

48:23.844 --> 48:25.444
What?
I was just sitting there!

48:25.445 --> 48:28.209
- You're a liar! You did!
- Maybe they both have it.

48:28.210 --> 48:30.911
- Jed, are you serious?
- Sam's not sick.

48:30.912 --> 48:32.910
Please...

48:32.911 --> 48:34.846
All right, well, what do we do now?

48:37.843 --> 48:39.946
I'm okay, guys, honestly.

48:40.945 --> 48:44.477
We tie her up.
Or she leaves.

48:44.478 --> 48:47.776
Mark, we can't send her outside.

48:47.777 --> 48:50.246
Well then we tie her up.

48:51.245 --> 48:52.977
- We should just bash her head in.
- Jed!

48:52.978 --> 48:56.644
What, I'm the odd
man out on this one?

48:56.645 --> 48:57.976
Really?
Go ahead, do it.

48:57.977 --> 49:01.776
Don't bash my head, please.

49:01.777 --> 49:04.744
I wasn't being serious.

49:04.745 --> 49:06.677
Okay, fine, maybe that
was a little harsh,

49:06.678 --> 49:09.344
but we know what happens next!

49:09.345 --> 49:11.476
I was just confused, okay?

49:11.477 --> 49:13.445
I didn't mean to call you a liar.

49:13.446 --> 49:14.843
You can tie me up,

49:14.844 --> 49:16.210
and then you'll see
that I'm not sick.

49:16.211 --> 49:18.417
Yeah, yeah, I'm gonna
go get something.

49:26.944 --> 49:28.578
You okay?

49:29.577 --> 49:30.578
I don't know...

49:31.577 --> 49:32.517
Hey, hey, hey...

49:32.543 --> 49:34.846
It's gonna be okay.

49:36.844 --> 49:39.079
I'll keep you safe.

49:41.077 --> 49:42.581
I know.

49:45.578 --> 49:48.349
I'm not goin' anywhere.

49:51.346 --> 49:53.382
You guys are cute together.

49:57.378 --> 49:59.811
This was all I could find.

49:59.812 --> 50:01.611
We're gonna keep you
upstairs just to be safe.

50:02.510 --> 50:03.776
We'll check on you.

50:03.777 --> 50:05.579
We just don't know what this is.

50:07.577 --> 50:10.344
Why?
Why upstairs?

50:10.345 --> 50:13.186
'Cause we don't want
to catch your crazy.

50:21.178 --> 50:23.544
What is that?

50:23.545 --> 50:24.704
<i>Do you want to be with Steve?</i>

50:25.510 --> 50:26.781
Yes.

50:29.778 --> 50:32.578
Mark, look at the lights!

50:38.379 --> 50:40.111
Hold on to her, Jed!

50:40.112 --> 50:41.378
I've got her!

51:25.978 --> 51:28.464
Fuck...

51:48.444 --> 51:50.746
Fuck!

51:52.744 --> 51:53.909
Mark, it's not your fault.

51:53.910 --> 51:55.616
I don't want to hear it, Sam!

52:00.611 --> 52:02.844
Just...

52:02.845 --> 52:04.583
Help me get her down.

52:30.445 --> 52:33.843
It seems the human loss count
has been more than imagined.

52:33.844 --> 52:36.677
At this time, the cause of
the outbreak is still unknown.

52:36.678 --> 52:39.643
We are going to our emergency
broadcast system at midnight.

52:39.644 --> 52:42.002
Our thoughts and prayers are
with the people of this planet,

52:42.377 --> 52:46.110
and the millions of souls
humanity has lost tonight.

52:46.111 --> 52:47.111
Happy New Year,

52:47.112 --> 52:49.146
and may God be with you.

54:24.710 --> 54:27.143
Holy shit.

54:27.144 --> 54:29.879
Oh my god.
What happened to her?

54:31.877 --> 54:33.346
Someone must have got in.

54:35.344 --> 54:36.977
Can you go back?

55:01.078 --> 55:03.582
Oh my god!

55:07.578 --> 55:11.044
Oh my god, this is fucked up.

55:12.045 --> 55:14.050
This gets worse.

55:19.045 --> 55:20.443
Well, maybe...

55:20.444 --> 55:23.344
maybe it's not worse.
I mean...

55:23.345 --> 55:24.877
They say this is a side effect,

55:24.878 --> 55:27.610
whatever this is that's going on.

55:27.611 --> 55:28.877
What if everybody that has it

55:28.878 --> 55:32.144
eventually... explodes and dies?

55:32.145 --> 55:35.277
I mean...

55:35.278 --> 55:37.710
If that's the case,
then all we need to do is just...

55:37.711 --> 55:39.582
We just gotta wait it out.

55:44.577 --> 55:45.618
Where are you -

55:53.610 --> 55:55.026
Fuck!

56:09.012 --> 56:10.888
Mark?

56:19.879 --> 56:21.342
Hey...

56:21.343 --> 56:22.579
Are you okay?

56:24.577 --> 56:26.176
Why are you still in here?

56:26.177 --> 56:28.342
<i>James Trevor, the owner and CEO</i>

56:28.343 --> 56:30.775
<i>of the extremely popular
networking site,</i>

56:30.776 --> 56:32.342
<i>the Social Redroom</i>

56:32.343 --> 56:34.843
<i>has been shot and killed

56:34.844 --> 56:37.643
<i>Only 45 minutes after
news was released</i>

Redroom's involvement</i>

56:39.276 --> 56:40.977

56:40.978 --> 56:43.809

<i>a former employee opened fire,</i>

56:45.511 --> 56:48.111
<i>killing Trevor,

56:49.110 --> 56:50.551
No fuckin' way.

56:58.543 --> 57:00.412
What is this?

57:02.410 --> 57:03.850
It's our basement.

57:09.844 --> 57:12.679
I saw something.
Before I...

58:07.878 --> 58:10.386
Mark, we have to go.

58:38.410 --> 58:39.112
Come on.

58:41.110 --> 58:42.442
Mark, come on.

58:42.443 --> 58:44.051
Why did you do that?

58:52.043 --> 58:53.446
Are you okay?

58:56.443 --> 58:59.843
I don't know.

58:59.844 --> 59:02.579
- Mark...
- I don't think so.

59:03.578 --> 59:06.409
I need you to stay with me.

59:06.410 --> 59:08.714
I'm seeing things.

59:11.711 --> 59:13.712
What if I have it?

59:15.710 --> 59:18.842
- Mark...
- Steve...

59:18.843 --> 59:21.049
tried to leave...
He knew.

59:26.044 --> 59:27.810
I need to.

59:27.811 --> 59:31.376
Please stay.
I can't do this alone.

59:31.377 --> 59:32.642
Mark, please stay.

59:32.643 --> 59:35.613
Don't go, please!
Listen! Listen!

59:37.611 --> 59:40.509
Please stay.

59:40.510 --> 59:42.222
We've been friends forever.

59:43.545 --> 59:45.112
And you've always
been there for me.

59:47.110 --> 59:48.246
I don't know...

59:50.244 --> 59:53.677
I don't know if I ever told
you how much that means.

59:53.678 --> 59:56.576
Maybe I didn't tell you, but...

59:56.577 --> 59:59.845
You mean everything to me.

01:00:01.844 --> 01:00:04.142
It's like I pushed everyone away.

01:00:04.143 --> 01:00:07.180
Maybe I pushed you
away too, I don't know.

01:00:10.177 --> 01:00:11.975
Maybe I...

01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:15.712
Maybe I've been really far...

01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:18.911
And I'm really sorry.

01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:23.980
But right now I'm
asking you to stay.

01:00:26.977 --> 01:00:30.847
And it's because I need you.

01:00:32.845 --> 01:00:34.615
I really need you.

01:00:39.610 --> 01:00:43.643
You don't understand.

01:00:43.644 --> 01:00:47.476
I can feel it inside of me.

01:00:47.477 --> 01:00:48.942
Mark, you don't have it.

01:00:48.943 --> 01:00:52.380
You're fine, you don't have it.

01:00:54.378 --> 01:00:56.379
Mark, please!

01:00:57.378 --> 01:00:59.579
Mark!

01:01:16.343 --> 01:01:18.444
Stay back.

01:01:19.443 --> 01:01:20.910
What are you doing?

01:01:20.911 --> 01:01:24.875
You need to get away from him, Sam.

01:01:24.876 --> 01:01:28.343
You've been on it, right, Mark?

01:01:28.344 --> 01:01:29.610
On what?

01:01:29.611 --> 01:01:31.577
Jed, put down the knife.

01:01:31.578 --> 01:01:33.477
I know what it is.

01:01:33.478 --> 01:01:34.710
All right, I know what it is,

01:01:34.711 --> 01:01:37.713
I know why people are getting sick.

01:01:39.711 --> 01:01:43.409
There's a video...
will you watch it?

01:01:43.410 --> 01:01:44.743
Jed, I need to leave -

01:01:44.744 --> 01:01:46.063
I need you to watch it, all right?

01:01:46.843 --> 01:01:49.712
Yeah?
Okay.

01:01:58.143 --> 01:01:59.876
If anybody out there is listening,

01:01:59.877 --> 01:02:01.243
please, you have to
believe me when I tell you

01:02:01.244 --> 01:02:02.942
that the Social Redroom is to blame.

01:02:02.943 --> 01:02:06.509
It is the cause for
this whole epidemic.

01:02:06.510 --> 01:02:08.909
For the past three years...

01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:11.209
we have been running...

01:02:11.210 --> 01:02:14.210
a subliminal pattern
underneath our website,

01:02:14.211 --> 01:02:18.175
trying to get users to visit
the website more frequently.

01:02:18.176 --> 01:02:21.509
It was impossible for us to
track the billions of users,

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:23.210
so we...

01:02:23.211 --> 01:02:25.643
we created a program
to do it for us.

01:02:25.644 --> 01:02:27.610
We're supposed to believe this?

01:02:27.611 --> 01:02:29.142
Keep watching.

01:02:29.143 --> 01:02:30.876
This is the reason
why you feel the need

01:02:30.877 --> 01:02:34.975
to add more photos,
to update statuses,

01:02:34.976 --> 01:02:37.976
to, uh, um... browse more often.

01:02:37.977 --> 01:02:40.976
And the update that
we released this morning...

01:02:40.977 --> 01:02:44.842
Well, that is highly
more addictive.

01:02:44.843 --> 01:02:46.943
The occasional nosebleed
was the only symptom, but...

01:02:46.944 --> 01:02:52.509
they kept the real
side effects a secret.

01:02:52.510 --> 01:02:54.409
Oh, god...

01:02:54.410 --> 01:02:56.510
hallucinations, and depression,

01:02:56.511 --> 01:02:58.376
and violence, you know?

01:02:58.377 --> 01:02:59.908
All kept a secret.

01:02:59.909 --> 01:03:02.809
After hearing about the
side effects, I, uh...

01:03:02.810 --> 01:03:03.769
I tried to shut it down.

01:03:04.743 --> 01:03:06.143
But it, uh...

01:03:06.144 --> 01:03:08.576
It went into some
sort of survival mode.

01:03:08.577 --> 01:03:09.711
Like a biological virus.

01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:12.945
It mutated, it started
to change people.

01:03:14.943 --> 01:03:20.577
The virus is moving through
those its infected.

01:03:20.578 --> 01:03:23.443
It's trying to
eliminate the threat -

01:03:23.444 --> 01:03:25.376
which is us.

01:03:25.377 --> 01:03:31.676
If you are experiencing
nosebleeds or hallucinations...

01:03:31.677 --> 01:03:33.542
There's no hope for you.

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:35.377
But I have posted a link

01:03:35.378 --> 01:03:41.175
for those that aren't
experiencing that, okay?

01:03:41.176 --> 01:03:44.380
It's risky,
but it might work for you.

01:03:46.378 --> 01:03:47.881
I am so sorry.

01:03:51.877 --> 01:03:54.412
Jed, this can't be true.

01:03:55.411 --> 01:03:57.712
Think about it.

01:03:58.711 --> 01:04:03.610
How else could a virus
spread worldwide in a day?

01:04:03.611 --> 01:04:05.842
A fucking day!

01:04:05.843 --> 01:04:07.142
Billions of people sick

01:04:07.143 --> 01:04:09.443
on all different
continents in one night!

01:04:09.444 --> 01:04:10.841
I was all right there, Sam!

01:04:10.842 --> 01:04:12.376
You need to get away
from him, all right?

01:04:12.377 --> 01:04:14.043
Just come over here.

01:04:14.044 --> 01:04:15.742
You...

01:04:15.743 --> 01:04:17.375
I'm sorry, Mark.

01:04:17.376 --> 01:04:19.383
Come here, Sam.

01:04:24.378 --> 01:04:26.378
I was on it.

01:04:27.377 --> 01:04:29.176
What?

01:04:29.177 --> 01:04:33.444
No, you deleted it,
you told us that you deleted it.

01:04:33.445 --> 01:04:36.376
Jed, I was just on it upstairs.

01:04:36.377 --> 01:04:37.846
<i>Please, Sam!</i>

01:04:39.844 --> 01:04:41.914
Fuck.

01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:48.309
You're saying that
'cause of him, right?

01:04:48.310 --> 01:04:51.410
You don't need to
protect him, all right?

01:04:51.411 --> 01:04:52.813
Just come over...
Come over here.

01:04:55.810 --> 01:04:59.376
I don't want to be alone.

01:04:59.377 --> 01:05:01.544
Please!
Please?

01:05:05.109 --> 01:05:06.310
There's a cure.

01:05:06.311 --> 01:05:09.209
There might be,
there might be a cure.

01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:11.176
There might be, there's a link.

01:05:11.177 --> 01:05:14.042
- What?
- What are you talking about?

01:05:14.043 --> 01:05:15.143
Well, what is it?

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:18.480
Get the fuck back!

01:05:21.477 --> 01:05:24.709
- The drill's downstairs.
- What are you talking about?

01:05:24.710 --> 01:05:26.444
I will show you!

01:05:26.445 --> 01:05:29.477
Okay.

01:05:29.478 --> 01:05:30.844
Okay...

01:05:35.544 --> 01:05:36.577
Brian?

01:05:37.576 --> 01:05:39.075
Brian!

01:05:39.076 --> 01:05:41.875
Dude, where are you?

01:05:43.876 --> 01:05:46.345
Brian...

01:05:47.344 --> 01:05:48.810
I watched it.

01:05:48.811 --> 01:05:50.443
I watched the links,
you were right, dude.

01:05:50.444 --> 01:05:52.408
What's going on?

01:05:52.409 --> 01:05:55.177
Residence is overrun.

01:05:55.178 --> 01:05:57.476
You all right?
Just come over here, man.

01:05:57.477 --> 01:06:00.442
I'm trapped on the roof.

01:06:00.443 --> 01:06:02.143
Well, is there a fire escape?

01:06:02.144 --> 01:06:04.744
Just look for a fire
escape, man, all right?

01:06:05.743 --> 01:06:08.212
Don't come any closer!

01:06:10.210 --> 01:06:11.608
- I gotta sign off.
- No! You don't!

01:06:12.575 --> 01:06:13.578
You gotta wait it out!

01:06:14.577 --> 01:06:16.142
No, Jed.

01:06:16.143 --> 01:06:17.643
That's it, man,
you just gotta wait it out.

01:06:17.644 --> 01:06:19.708
They're dying off, I promise you!

01:06:19.709 --> 01:06:21.581
I know.
There's no more time.

01:06:25.577 --> 01:06:29.143
Sorry to be a downer
on your party, man.

01:06:29.144 --> 01:06:30.383
I don't think I'm gonna make it.

01:06:35.777 --> 01:06:38.410
Yeah, well...

01:06:38.411 --> 01:06:40.575
The party kind of sucked anyway.

01:06:40.576 --> 01:06:42.379
I gotta go.

01:06:44.377 --> 01:06:48.476
Brian?
Brian!

01:06:48.477 --> 01:06:50.579
He can't hear me.
He can't hear me.

01:06:52.577 --> 01:06:54.576
Brian!

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:57.908
Please!

01:06:57.909 --> 01:07:00.143
Brian, please, please!

01:07:00.144 --> 01:07:02.978
Brian, no, no!

01:07:07.576 --> 01:07:10.043
No!

01:07:15.876 --> 01:07:17.343
Jed!

01:07:17.344 --> 01:07:18.712
Jed, don't!

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:31.143
I'm sorry...

01:07:31.144 --> 01:07:32.444
Jed!

01:08:01.077 --> 01:08:02.710
Hold the door!

01:08:20.111 --> 01:08:21.515
Fuck!

01:08:44.577 --> 01:08:46.758
Where's the link?

01:09:00.743 --> 01:09:02.822
What you are about to see
is a procedure that we feel

01:09:03.408 --> 01:09:06.542
might be the cure for
what they are calling

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:08.542
the 'Redroom Virus'.

01:09:08.544 --> 01:09:12.475
<i>This virus attacks the
amygdala area of the brain,</i>

01:09:12.477 --> 01:09:15.310
<i>which stimulates an
over-production of cells</i>

01:09:15.310 --> 01:09:18.609
<i>which creates a new kind of brain</i>

01:09:18.609 --> 01:09:19.569
<i>in the form of a tumor.</i>

01:09:20.376 --> 01:09:23.243
<i>This is to accommodate
the overwhelming number</i>

01:09:23.245 --> 01:09:26.841
of new signals the
brain is receiving

01:09:26.843 --> 01:09:32.841
from others infected by the
Social Redroom dot com.

01:09:32.843 --> 01:09:34.377
<i>It is this increase in brain mass</i>

01:09:35.376 --> 01:09:39.176
<i>that is causing these hallucinations.</i>

01:09:49.211 --> 01:09:51.375
<i>From our limited research,</i>

01:09:51.376 --> 01:09:54.142
if you are already
experiencing hallucinations,

01:09:54.143 --> 01:09:56.776
this surgery will not help you.

01:09:56.777 --> 01:09:58.810
It means that the tumor

01:09:58.811 --> 01:10:03.045
is already too deeply entrenched.

01:10:06.477 --> 01:10:08.209
Before you begin,

01:10:08.210 --> 01:10:10.041
<i>make sure that your patient is</i>

01:10:10.042 --> 01:10:15.575
immobilized, secured to a
chair or a table with a rope.

01:10:15.876 --> 01:10:17.482
Or a belt will suffice.

01:10:23.476 --> 01:10:26.374
First, make an incision

01:10:26.375 --> 01:10:28.375
at the pre-frontal cortex,

01:10:28.376 --> 01:10:30.593
either here or here.

01:10:46.577 --> 01:10:48.443
Once you have exposed the skull,

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:49.876
you'll need to drill a small hole

01:10:49.877 --> 01:10:51.978
large enough for a hobby knife.

01:10:52.977 --> 01:10:57.144
And be careful not to drill too deep.

01:10:58.143 --> 01:11:00.541
This is the most important part:

01:11:00.542 --> 01:11:02.342
Once the hole is drilled,

01:11:02.343 --> 01:11:04.175
a black artery will appear.

01:11:04.176 --> 01:11:06.709
This is the artery
that feeds the tumor,

01:11:06.710 --> 01:11:10.476
and accelerates the growth.

01:11:10.477 --> 01:11:12.843
This increase in brain mass

01:11:12.844 --> 01:11:16.176
is the eventual cause
of the skull bursting.

01:11:16.177 --> 01:11:20.375
Even after death, the
tumor continues to grow.

01:11:20.376 --> 01:11:23.051
We don't know why or how.

01:11:47.409 --> 01:11:49.581
This is what you've removed.

01:11:54.576 --> 01:11:56.576
That's in our heads?

01:11:56.577 --> 01:11:58.478
Is this possible?

01:11:59.477 --> 01:12:02.275
What?
No.

01:12:02.276 --> 01:12:05.842
It's brain surgery with
a household drill, no.

01:12:05.843 --> 01:12:07.709
You heard what he said.

01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:09.341
We'll die anyway.

01:12:09.342 --> 01:12:12.442
We can't do this.

01:12:12.443 --> 01:12:13.909
We have to.

01:12:13.910 --> 01:12:15.341
I'm not drilling a hole
in your head, Sam!

01:12:15.342 --> 01:12:16.679
That's insane!

01:12:19.676 --> 01:12:22.013
Mark, we can do this.

01:12:55.443 --> 01:12:57.882
I'm sorry, Sam.

01:13:02.877 --> 01:13:05.409
I can't.

01:13:05.410 --> 01:13:06.579
I'm sick.

01:13:09.576 --> 01:13:11.410
Please don't...

01:13:12.409 --> 01:13:14.415
Please don't make me do this.

01:13:19.410 --> 01:13:21.779
Okay, then I'll do you first.

01:13:23.777 --> 01:13:26.408
If the video's right,
then it's too late for me.

01:13:26.409 --> 01:13:27.674
Look at me.

01:13:27.675 --> 01:13:29.712
We're not gonna die down here!

01:13:31.710 --> 01:13:33.045
What if it doesn't work?

01:13:36.043 --> 01:13:37.812
It has to.

01:13:40.809 --> 01:13:43.141
We don't have much time.

01:13:44.242 --> 01:13:47.052
We have to do this.

01:14:17.043 --> 01:14:18.378
Hey...

01:14:20.376 --> 01:14:24.142
If something goes wrong...

01:14:24.143 --> 01:14:27.675
it's okay.

01:14:27.676 --> 01:14:29.915
There's no other way.

01:15:06.910 --> 01:15:08.376
What you are about to see

01:15:08.377 --> 01:15:11.409
is a procedure that we
feel might be the cure

01:15:11.410 --> 01:15:14.144
for what they are calling
the 'Redroom Virus'...

01:15:16.142 --> 01:15:17.378
Bite into this.

01:15:19.376 --> 01:15:22.142
<i>Which stimulates the
overproduction of cells,</i>

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:25.376
<i>which creates a new kind of brain</i>

01:15:25.377 --> 01:15:26.841

<i>This is to accommodate</i>

01:15:29.343 --> 01:15:30.943

<i>new signals the brain is

<i>infected by the Social

01:15:41.576 --> 01:15:43.376
<i>She's going to die, Mark.</i>

01:15:43.377 --> 01:15:45.913
<i>Why are you fighting us?</i>

01:15:48.910 --> 01:15:50.584
What?

01:15:57.577 --> 01:16:01.579
Okay, are you ready?

01:16:43.042 --> 01:16:43.943
Mark...

01:17:02.543 --> 01:17:04.144
You can feel it, Mark.

01:17:05.143 --> 01:17:08.445
Chad?

01:17:10.443 --> 01:17:12.247
How we're all connected now.

01:17:15.244 --> 01:17:19.709
Everyone knows
everything about you.

01:17:19.710 --> 01:17:21.882
And you know everything
about everyone else.

01:17:28.875 --> 01:17:30.177
If you listen to us...

01:17:31.176 --> 01:17:34.478
we can save you.

01:17:36.476 --> 01:17:38.109
Your pain...

01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:40.380
will be our pain.

01:17:43.377 --> 01:17:44.974
You're not really here.

01:17:44.975 --> 01:17:49.907
If you operate on
her, she will die.

01:17:49.908 --> 01:17:51.117
No.

01:17:59.109 --> 01:18:01.446
Mark, focus on me.

01:18:05.442 --> 01:18:07.347
Ah...

01:18:11.343 --> 01:18:12.576
Mark!

01:19:15.176 --> 01:19:18.380
Mark!

01:19:22.376 --> 01:19:24.075
Please don't leave me.

01:19:24.076 --> 01:19:25.343
Not you.

01:19:26.342 --> 01:19:28.408
I can't do it.

01:19:28.409 --> 01:19:31.477
Get... get out.

01:19:32.476 --> 01:19:34.143
Mark...

01:19:35.142 --> 01:19:37.576
Mark, I can't do this alone.

01:19:37.577 --> 01:19:40.117
You're not alone.

01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:48.347
I love you.

01:19:52.343 --> 01:19:54.582
I love you too, Sam.

01:20:00.576 --> 01:20:03.343
Mark...

01:20:03.344 --> 01:20:04.176
Mark!

01:26:02.709 --> 01:26:05.907
<i>Law enforcement officials...</i>
