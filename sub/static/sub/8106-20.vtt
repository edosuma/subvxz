WEBVTT

00:01.126 --> 00:03.836
Ladies and gentlemen, step around.
Step around. Come on. Gather around.

00:03.962 --> 00:05.755
We'll show you a little way to make
a little easy money today.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.298
You understand what I'm saying?
These are the blacks.

00:07.424 --> 00:09.300
Don't follow the blacks.
You wanna follow the queen. Know why?

00:09.426 --> 00:11.219
'Cause she's red
and that means she is hot.

00:11.345 --> 00:12.470
You gotta find the queen.
Find the queen.

00:12.596 --> 00:14.806
The first of the day is free to play.
Who wants to play?

00:14.932 --> 00:17.183
You look interested, my man.
You wanna step on up? Come on now.

00:17.309 --> 00:19.143
Who wants to play?
Oh, what about you, sweetie?

00:19.269 --> 00:20.144
- You're cute. Come on up.
- All right.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.605
Come on here and play.
Cute girls win money. You look lucky.

00:22.731 --> 00:23.856
Now, you look lucky.
Now, follow the queen.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.108
Here we go,
ladies and gentlemen. Follow the queen.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.067
Follow the queen.

00:26.193 --> 00:28.528
Ain't no Helen Mirren,
but this queen is for you!

00:28.654 --> 00:30.988
Which one? Which one?
Which one is it? Which one is it?

00:31.115 --> 00:33.241
- It's right there.
- Right there?

00:35.202 --> 00:36.953
Beginner's luck. Beginner's luck.
I'll tell you what.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.246
It takes a woman
to know a woman.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.831
It takes a lady
to find a queen.

00:39.957 --> 00:43.251
There you go...
Wanna double up?

00:44.253 --> 00:45.837
- All right.
- All right, we've got a chancer.

00:45.963 --> 00:47.171
We got a chancer.
We got a chancer.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.423
All right. Here we go.
Here we go.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.841
All you gotta do
is find your queen.

00:49.967 --> 00:52.885
You will not win again.
You will not win again. All right.

00:53.011 --> 00:55.012
Here we go. Here we go.
Find your queen. Find your queen.

00:55.139 --> 00:56.889
Where is she? Where is she?
Where is she?

00:57.015 --> 00:58.224
Can you find her?

00:58.350 --> 01:02.103
- Right there.
- This one? Oh, my...

01:02.229 --> 01:04.313
She is killing me here.
Taking all my money.

01:04.648 --> 01:06.441
Anybody else wanna get behind
the good-luck girl?

01:06.650 --> 01:07.692
I can do it.

01:07.818 --> 01:08.943
You can do it?
All right. You're next.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.653
Just give me a chance
to recover and get my money back

01:10.779 --> 01:12.405
or else I'm gonna be out here
sleeping on the street.

01:12.531 --> 01:13.698
Here we go.
All right? Ready?

01:13.824 --> 01:15.158
This is the last time.
I'm not messing with you no more.

01:15.284 --> 01:16.284
You're taking
all my money, girl.

01:16.410 --> 01:17.452
I'm not messing
with you no more.

01:17.578 --> 01:19.036
Here we go. One more chance.
This is your last chance.

01:19.163 --> 01:20.121
You're gonna follow
the queen, baby.

01:20.247 --> 01:21.414
Follow the queen.
Where's she at? Where's she at?

01:21.540 --> 01:23.458
Just one time.
I'll show you one time and there she is.

01:23.584 --> 01:26.002
Boom. Boom. Boom.
Pick a card.

01:29.131 --> 01:30.631
I can't decide.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.508
What do you mean? Just pick a card.
Just make a decision.

01:32.760 --> 01:33.760
I can't decide.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.428
Come on. Any card will do.
Left? Right? Center?

01:35.554 --> 01:36.888
I don't know.

01:37.222 --> 01:38.556
- Do you want the right?
- I don't know.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.391
- I...
- The left?

01:40.517 --> 01:42.143
- The center?
- I don't know. I...

01:42.269 --> 01:43.394
Move out the way and just
let somebody else play then?

01:43.520 --> 01:46.522
I can't decide. I can't.

01:46.648 --> 01:47.607
You wanna flip
a coin for it?

01:47.775 --> 01:49.442
What's wrong with me?

01:51.945 --> 01:53.154
Is she okay?

02:29.650 --> 02:31.776
Scariest 30 seconds
of my life.

02:32.236 --> 02:33.611
I couldn't do anything.

02:33.737 --> 02:36.280
It's like I couldn't
move inside my head.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.615
It's called abulia.

02:37.741 --> 02:40.868
The inability to
make a decision or exercise will.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.203
Is it going to happen again?

02:42.329 --> 02:44.956
It's part of a TIA.
A transient ischemic attack.

02:45.082 --> 02:47.124
Blood was cut off to a section
of your frontal lobe.

02:47.251 --> 02:48.876
Is it like a stroke
or something?

02:49.002 --> 02:49.919
A little.

02:50.963 --> 02:52.463
What drugs have you
taken recently?

02:53.549 --> 02:54.674
No drugs.

02:54.883 --> 02:56.551
Toxins are
another possibility.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.803
You might have been exposed
to something at work, for instance.

02:58.929 --> 03:01.055
No real job right now.

03:01.515 --> 03:02.807
Exposure can build up
over time

03:02.933 --> 03:04.433
and lie dormant for a while.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.894
- What was your last job?
- Pet store.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.354
Exotic pets?

03:08.480 --> 03:09.814
Tropical fish.

03:09.940 --> 03:10.815
And before that?

03:11.108 --> 03:11.941
Unemployment.

03:13.402 --> 03:14.986
And before that,

03:16.196 --> 03:18.698
I sold subscriptions
on the phone.

03:18.824 --> 03:20.867
And before that,
unemployment.

03:21.994 --> 03:25.121
Before that,
I worked at Jeans Gone Wild.

03:25.372 --> 03:30.042
Before that, unemployment.
Before that, I walked dogs.

03:30.586 --> 03:33.129
And before that...

03:34.464 --> 03:37.425
Loss of free will. I like it.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.012
Maybe we can get
Thomas Aquinas in for a consult.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.139
What caused the TIA?

03:43.473 --> 03:45.099
Arteries are clear.
No sign of a clot.

03:45.392 --> 03:47.435
Could have dissolved.
Most likely came from her heart.

03:47.561 --> 03:48.436
We should do a bubble study.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.022
Clots are unlikely
in a 28-year-old who's not on the pill.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.232
It's probably a vasospasm
caused by drugs.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.943
I don't think so.
She goes from job to job.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.945
Maybe there's some kind
of ADD here.

03:58.280 --> 03:59.614
Help us pinpoint
where the neurological...

03:59.740 --> 04:02.408
She goes from job to job
because she's a scam artist.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.827
She works just long enough
to qualify for unemployment,

04:04.953 --> 04:06.454
then gets fired
and gets high.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.539
I still don't think
it's drugs.

04:08.665 --> 04:09.999
Did you check
for infection?

04:10.125 --> 04:11.417
LP showed nothing.
No fever.

04:11.543 --> 04:12.543
White blood count is normal.

04:12.669 --> 04:13.628
Could be toxic exposure.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.796
You're the one always saying
it must be drugs.

04:15.923 --> 04:18.132
You figure she's a minority,
she must be stoned?

04:18.258 --> 04:20.176
- You know that's not what I...
- She seems like a nice girl.

04:20.302 --> 04:21.427
You haven't met her!

04:21.553 --> 04:23.429
She was pregnant at 15,
dropped out of high school.

04:23.555 --> 04:24.889
She's a real overachiever.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.099
Come on. Cut her some slack.
Her baby died of SIDS.

04:27.225 --> 04:28.351
This isn't some
romantic story

04:28.477 --> 04:30.102
about a nice girl
scarred by tragedy.

04:30.228 --> 04:32.563
She's a drug-using scam artist
scarred by tragedy.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.232
On the other hand,
the tox screen just came back.

04:35.359 --> 04:36.525
She's clean.

04:36.652 --> 04:38.694
You're wasting my time.
He's wasting...

04:43.533 --> 04:45.952
Second ex-Mrs. Wilson
want money?

04:47.079 --> 04:48.496
I am no longer
paying alimony.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.122
She wanted
her independence,

04:50.248 --> 04:51.499
so she got her
realtor's license.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.334
Market's doing badly.
She wants money.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.794
Market's doing badly.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.295
She's moving into a condo.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.631
- She wants...
- She wants me to take Hector.

05:00.175 --> 05:01.342
Pool boy?

05:01.969 --> 05:03.052
Dog.

05:03.178 --> 05:04.095
No longer interested.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.347
We got him
on our honeymoon.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.516
So I'm like
the other parent.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.934
But I can't take him.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.145
My hotel doesn't allow dogs.
Besides, I'm always here.

05:13.271 --> 05:14.605
I asked Cuddy
to a play Thursday.

05:18.944 --> 05:20.486
Oh, you... Okay.

05:20.988 --> 05:22.363
She said she was busy.

05:22.489 --> 05:26.075
And you didn't believe her,
so you bribed a janitor,

05:26.201 --> 05:28.536
broke into her computer,
checked her appointments...

05:28.662 --> 05:30.413
I asked her as a test.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.540
What would you have learned
if she'd said yes?

05:32.666 --> 05:33.958
A lot about bondage.

05:34.626 --> 05:36.002
She was busy for me
but not for you.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.212
She's not interested
in play qua play.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.922
She's interested in you.

05:40.048 --> 05:43.759
No. I'm not getting sucked into the
vortex of your insanity again.

05:43.885 --> 05:44.927
Don't pass me
notes in class.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.429
Don't tell me to
ask her to the prom.

05:46.555 --> 05:47.972
You cannot
see her socially.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.140
You're leading her on.

05:49.266 --> 05:52.059
I'll consider that. After I take her
to the Hockney exhibit.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.062
On Thursday.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.898
See, she is busy.
It's not a date.

05:59.067 --> 06:01.944
She enjoyed the play. I enjoyed her
enjoying the play.

06:02.070 --> 06:04.989
The woman works hard.
It's nice to see her relax.

06:05.949 --> 06:09.243
So all this enjoying
is an act of charity.

06:09.453 --> 06:11.746
I'm keeping the receipts
for tax purposes.

06:17.252 --> 06:20.755
What's life without the ability
to make stupid choices?

06:21.173 --> 06:22.506
She needs her free will.

06:22.632 --> 06:25.718
Find out why her brain froze before she
can't decide to take her next breath.

06:25.844 --> 06:27.678
You find the toxins.
You run your bubble study.

06:27.804 --> 06:30.056
You won't find anything but
I'll get the office to myself.

06:30.599 --> 06:33.059
There's a lot of porn
piling up on the Internet.

06:33.185 --> 06:34.393
Doesn't download itself.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.440
Eric? Eric!

06:39.983 --> 06:40.816
Hello, Mr. Foreman.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.653
- Dr. Chase. How are you?
- Good.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.072
You're lucky
you caught us, actually...

06:46.198 --> 06:47.281
I'll meet you outside.

06:49.367 --> 06:53.913
Hey, Dad. I've got to go.
Why are you here?

06:54.039 --> 06:55.873
Everything okay?

06:55.999 --> 06:56.916
Good as ever.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.251
We're staying at a hotel
down the street.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.128
You didn't bring Mom with you?

07:01.546 --> 07:03.714
It's gonna be her
60th birthday in a few days.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.841
I know. We talked
about it on the phone.

07:06.051 --> 07:07.927
You said you couldn't
come home.

07:08.762 --> 07:09.595
You didn't have to come.

07:09.930 --> 07:13.182
You haven't been home
in eight years.

07:14.851 --> 07:16.602
She should see you,

07:17.354 --> 07:18.979
while she still
knows who you are.

07:21.942 --> 07:25.111
Dad. I've talked to her
on the phone.

07:25.904 --> 07:29.490
She only knows
who I am sometimes.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.617
Sometimes

07:33.120 --> 07:34.662
is important.

07:37.040 --> 07:40.042
So what's up with your dad?
Didn't know he was gonna be in town?

07:40.168 --> 07:41.001
No.

07:43.255 --> 07:46.132
Building this old, could be
toxic exposure anywhere.

07:46.258 --> 07:49.677
Asbestos, mold, the coloring agents
in the old wallpaper.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.720
Or it could be drugs.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.764
I thought we ruled out...

07:55.475 --> 07:58.144
Clean tox screen means
drugs didn't cause the TIA.

07:58.353 --> 08:00.187
Drugs can be laced
with toxic substances.

08:00.313 --> 08:02.064
Arsenic, rat poison.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.399
The drugs wash out
of her system,

08:03.525 --> 08:04.358
the toxins stick around.

08:04.568 --> 08:06.360
Exposure could come about
any number of ways.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.320
There's no reason to assume
it was through drug use.

08:08.780 --> 08:11.031
Absolutely.
Except for the crack pipe.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.534
I'll test her blood
for arsenic and rat poison.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.744
Yeah. Yeah.
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

08:17.122 --> 08:19.081
And your dad asked you out
for dinner?

08:20.876 --> 08:23.752
I'll do the tests.
You're stuck with your family.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.425
You like Hockney?

08:29.551 --> 08:30.759
You heard about that.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.096
The pop stuff or
the Venezuelan pictures?

08:35.223 --> 08:36.849
That's a trick question.

08:37.601 --> 08:40.811
Yes. But you have no idea
how it's a trick.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.772
I like art. I'm open to new things.
What's the problem?

08:44.024 --> 08:47.359
You're going to a gallery to see
Venezuelan pictures that don't exist.

08:47.485 --> 08:49.195
But you won't go
to a play with me. Why?

08:49.321 --> 08:52.489
House, why is my social life
suddenly red hot?

08:52.616 --> 08:55.159
One minute I'm mushing along
with the huskies as usual

08:55.285 --> 08:57.411
and suddenly
it's global warming.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.914
You think you saw somebody else pick up
a toy from the sandbox

09:00.040 --> 09:01.707
and suddenly you want it.

09:02.584 --> 09:03.584
Is that why you said no?

09:03.919 --> 09:07.713
Maybe I just want a friend
and I thought Wilson was a safe choice.

09:08.632 --> 09:11.300
I'm not safe? Cool.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.846
James Wilson is never
the safe choice.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.307
We're going to a gallery.
We're not getting married.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.017
Sure, you say that now.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.810
He always marries them
in the end.

09:34.783 --> 09:36.867
Is that Eric? Eric!

09:36.993 --> 09:38.035
Oh!

09:39.120 --> 09:41.664
Oh, baby. Baby!

09:43.124 --> 09:46.377
I wanted to find that picture I took
at your high school graduation.

09:46.544 --> 09:47.753
I had it reframed.

09:47.879 --> 09:50.464
It's in one of these
suitcases, but I don't know...

09:50.590 --> 09:51.924
You can show it to me later.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.100
Your father wants to know
if you've been praying.

10:01.518 --> 10:04.061
You don't have to just
come out with it like that.

10:04.479 --> 10:06.855
But I only want to know
if you're happy.

10:06.982 --> 10:08.190
Sure. I'm okay.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.733
You like it here?
You have friends?

10:09.985 --> 10:11.902
Yeah.
Everything is great, Mom.

10:12.028 --> 10:13.779
That's why I brought
the picture for you.

10:14.072 --> 10:15.781
I remember
when you were little

10:15.907 --> 10:18.993
you liked to look in the back of
the math book because you knew

10:19.119 --> 10:20.953
even though it made
no sense then,

10:21.079 --> 10:23.998
by the end of the year
you'd understand it all.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.667
That's why
you brought the picture?

10:26.793 --> 10:30.504
You wanted to look ahead,
to see how far you'd go.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.924
Now you're a grown man,
I thought you might like to look back

10:34.050 --> 10:36.093
to see how far you've come.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.887
It all makes sense now.
Doesn't it?

10:45.603 --> 10:46.770
That isn't mine.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.314
It was in your closet.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.358
It belongs to this guy
who used to live with me.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.820
You might want to let him know
he's got arsenic poisoning.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.197
We should get
a sample of his hair

10:57.324 --> 10:58.657
so we can see
the extent of it.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.493
But I don't do...
I don't do drugs.

11:12.547 --> 11:15.716
Get a crash cart in here!
Respiratory arrest!

11:20.305 --> 11:22.931
Are you sure
it isn't from the arsenic?

11:23.058 --> 11:25.267
Dr. Foreman said
I was poisoned.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.394
Your hair showed
only a trace amount.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.896
Not enough to damage
your lungs like this.

11:29.064 --> 11:30.773
We need you
to stay still now.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.194
Six-millimeter cuts
starting at the apices.

11:36.821 --> 11:38.572
Also, I just wanted
to let you know

11:38.698 --> 11:41.158
should you change your mind,
I'll be available.

11:42.494 --> 11:45.037
Aren't you getting tired
of hearing me say it?

11:45.330 --> 11:47.206
I have no intention
of going out with you,

11:47.332 --> 11:49.875
of having sex with you,
of doing anything with you.

11:50.001 --> 11:50.834
Except work.

11:51.127 --> 11:52.628
We don't have to make
a big deal about it.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.213
I just thought
I'd let you know.

11:55.006 --> 11:57.466
I decided Tuesdays would be
a good day to do that.

11:58.468 --> 12:00.594
You did not suddenly
fall in love with me.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.347
You were looking for something
and I happened to be standing...

12:03.473 --> 12:05.057
Cameron, it's fine.

12:06.851 --> 12:08.185
No need to go on about it.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.898
Advancing through
the lung bases.

12:13.733 --> 12:14.608
We need to put this
behind us.

12:14.901 --> 12:15.901
Understood.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.987
- But you keep bringing it up.
- You're the one who's still talking.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.907
Look, I'm not demanding
anything from you.

12:22.033 --> 12:25.285
I'm not following you home.
I've got no expectations.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.747
A gentle, polite reminder
once a week is hardly stalking.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.880
There's a mass.
Just outside the lingula.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.177
Biopsy shows
there are white blood cells

12:42.303 --> 12:43.637
in the walls
of the blood vessels.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.973
They're not supposed
to get past the bouncers.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.975
Got to be autoimmune,
something lymphocytic.

12:48.268 --> 12:49.852
White blood cells
are attacking her own body.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.062
Only question is,
what kind of autoimmune?

12:52.188 --> 12:53.021
Doesn't matter what kind.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.565
It always matters what kind.

12:55.066 --> 12:55.983
Treatment's always steroids.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.693
Treatment is always boring.

12:57.819 --> 12:58.944
- Diagnosis...
- Okay.

12:59.070 --> 13:00.571
It's affecting
the larger blood vessels.

13:00.697 --> 13:03.449
Gotta be giant cell arteritis.
I'll start her on steroids.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.200
It's affecting
the smaller blood vessels.

13:05.326 --> 13:06.535
Gotta be lupus vasculitis.

13:06.661 --> 13:07.995
I'll start her on steroids.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.372
- It's affecting...
- Yeah. Got it.

13:10.832 --> 13:11.832
Start her on steroids.

13:11.958 --> 13:12.791
Good idea.

13:14.878 --> 13:16.753
Told you. That was boring.

13:17.589 --> 13:19.047
- I gotta go out.
- Why?

13:19.591 --> 13:20.883
Wilson's got a date.

13:22.552 --> 13:24.011
It's got
15-foot ceilings.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.888
It's got an open floor plan.

13:27.474 --> 13:29.433
You know, I can't believe
you called me.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.477
Hey. I need a condo.

13:32.270 --> 13:35.814
Didn't you and Wilson have
your first date around here?

13:36.441 --> 13:39.610
Wow! You remember
where our first date was?

13:40.069 --> 13:41.487
I didn't think
you were paying attention.

13:41.696 --> 13:44.031
Really? He's my best friend.

13:44.574 --> 13:46.158
Our first date was in Boston.

13:46.367 --> 13:47.409
Oh.

13:47.744 --> 13:49.828
Not quite as close
to here as I remember.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.580
But we're not here
to talk about him.

13:51.706 --> 13:52.873
Absolutely not.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.250
Wait till you see the kitchen.

13:56.794 --> 13:58.629
All-granite countertops.

13:59.214 --> 14:01.798
Since I wasn't paying
attention back then,

14:01.925 --> 14:03.008
what was it like dating him?

14:04.969 --> 14:07.012
- So this is Hockney?
- No.

14:07.138 --> 14:09.306
I don't know what happened.

14:10.058 --> 14:11.433
I'm sure you don't.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.605
I never knew your tastes
were so eclectic.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.691
Oh, the Hockney exhibit
finished on April 20th.

14:19.817 --> 14:21.151
I thought it was May 20th.

14:21.903 --> 14:23.070
Okay. My bad.

14:24.072 --> 14:26.823
This is not somewhere
I'd bring someone on a date.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.702
Not that this is a date.
Obviously.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.581
I was just thinking...

14:34.999 --> 14:37.209
He's doing landscapes
on multiple canvases now.

14:37.377 --> 14:41.964
And they're kind of peaceful
and you're always so busy...

14:42.257 --> 14:43.549
Wow.

14:45.009 --> 14:47.511
I don't think I've ever
seen you embarrassed before.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.013
Oh, it was never a date.

14:50.139 --> 14:52.099
I was coming off
a bad relationship

14:52.225 --> 14:54.309
and he said we could
go out as friends.

14:54.435 --> 14:57.479
You know, just go see plays,
go to a museum.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.273
I didn't think
you liked Trenton.

14:59.774 --> 15:00.816
Love it.

15:01.234 --> 15:04.403
So he'd say it's not a date
but then he'd jump you.

15:04.529 --> 15:05.654
Oh, no. He meant it.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.198
James Wilson,
carefully calibrating

15:08.324 --> 15:12.744
his level of protectiveness
for your individual needs.

15:12.870 --> 15:14.997
Did you just compare
Wilson to a tampon?

15:15.123 --> 15:16.039
No.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.294
It was very endearing.
He really just wanted to be a friend.

15:20.962 --> 15:22.212
So I jumped him.

15:24.132 --> 15:25.799
The bedroom's through here.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.177
That's such a bad idea.

15:29.304 --> 15:32.306
There's no way that won't cause damage
to the large intestine.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.975
Are you keeping us here
to torture me?

15:39.314 --> 15:41.690
- Is that a bicycle pump?
- That's what I'm saying.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.984
It's like walking
into a sticky trap.

15:44.402 --> 15:47.738
And once you're the focus
of all that attention, it's addictive.

15:47.864 --> 15:50.616
This unit's kitchen's
got a chef's oven.

15:50.742 --> 15:52.200
I cook a lot. Go on.

15:52.327 --> 15:55.495
But it's the emotional stuff
that really sucks you in.

15:56.164 --> 15:59.583
He's just so knight-in-shining-armor,
you know?

15:59.917 --> 16:03.670
Always there to support you,
until one day he's not.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.422
But by then you're hooked.

16:06.466 --> 16:11.011
Hey, do you think that you could talk
to him about taking the dog?

16:11.471 --> 16:14.222
He's the only one
that Hector really gets along with.

16:14.349 --> 16:17.434
Hey, we're here to talk
real estate, not Wilson.

16:20.355 --> 16:22.439
So you're saying
if you'd actually had sex

16:22.565 --> 16:25.525
before you connected emotionally,
you'd have gotten over him.

16:25.652 --> 16:28.153
Oh, yeah.
Seems weird, right?

16:28.738 --> 16:32.824
'Cause sex with James
is fantastic.

16:33.368 --> 16:36.203
Nobody works harder
to give a woman what she wants.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.247
It's got six burners.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.209
The chef's oven.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.335
Right.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.303
How you feeling?

16:53.429 --> 16:54.888
That wasn't my crack pipe.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.765
You told me. Are you tired?

16:57.100 --> 16:59.476
I just took a hit off it
a couple of times.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.562
What's wrong with
having a little fun?

17:02.689 --> 17:04.648
Your personal life
is none of my business.

17:07.610 --> 17:08.819
You don't like me though,
do you?

17:08.945 --> 17:10.654
That's your imagination.

17:10.780 --> 17:12.197
I've seen every kind
of drug abuse.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.991
No offense, but you don't even stand out
of the pack.

17:15.201 --> 17:18.537
I'm betting you got money
in the same place you got attitude.

17:19.205 --> 17:22.207
You know, people who quit drinking
and people who lose weight.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.918
They think they're better
than the people that couldn't

17:25.044 --> 17:27.003
and because you got
out of the projects,

17:27.130 --> 17:29.881
you think that
anybody who didn't

17:31.342 --> 17:32.634
is weak and stupid.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.262
I'm not judging you.
Now take a breath.

17:35.388 --> 17:37.264
The only difference
between me and you

17:37.390 --> 17:39.433
is that I made
some bad decisions

17:39.559 --> 17:40.809
and you made some good ones.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.520
You make bad decisions
every day of your life.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.772
Stop doing drugs.
Stop having fun.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.607
Go back to school
and get your GED.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.609
Yeah, where's the money
coming from?

17:49.777 --> 17:52.320
The system's not set up
for people like me.

17:53.239 --> 17:55.198
What are you staring at?

17:55.324 --> 17:56.324
Your eyes.

17:59.370 --> 18:00.871
There's yellow in the sclera.

18:01.831 --> 18:03.457
Her liver's failing.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.834
Without a transplant,
she'll be dead in the next 48 hours.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.919
We should increase her
immunosuppressants

18:08.045 --> 18:09.171
and target more specifically.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.130
Add methotrexate.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.381
Yeah, let's do more
of what's not working.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.300
This isn't an
autoimmune disease.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.177
Her white blood cells
are attacking her body.

18:15.303 --> 18:16.261
That's autoimmune.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.138
First brain,
then lungs, now liver.

18:18.264 --> 18:20.182
All getting worse
and all in two days.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.850
It's moving too fast.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.562
It's gotta be cancer.
Lymphomatoid granulomatosis.

18:25.855 --> 18:28.857
It's rare even by our standards
but it fits her symptoms.

18:28.983 --> 18:31.651
Explains why the steroids aren't
working, poor fingernail growth.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.069
A lot of people
have bad fingernails.

18:33.196 --> 18:35.655
A lot of people don't have
three organ systems shutting down.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.824
Her blood vessels are
taking this thing everywhere.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.284
She needs total
body radiation.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.119
We can't do anything
until we can confirm...

18:41.245 --> 18:43.121
Running those
immunochemistries could take a week.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.206
She'll be dead by the time...

18:44.332 --> 18:46.041
That doesn't make
radiation any safer.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.209
Okay.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.252
Suppose Chase
and Cameron are right.

18:49.378 --> 18:51.338
Suppose it's an
autoimmune disease.

18:51.756 --> 18:54.090
What's the biggest danger
of total body radiation?

18:54.425 --> 18:55.801
It suppresses
the immune system,

18:55.927 --> 18:58.762
which is what we're trying to do
with the steroids anyway.

18:59.680 --> 19:01.431
I don't usually
put out on my first date

19:01.557 --> 19:03.934
but I gotta say
that is a rad move.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.937
Get her consent.
Start the radiation.

19:09.023 --> 19:11.441
The patient's
not too thrilled with me.

19:11.734 --> 19:13.109
I'll get her consent.

19:14.278 --> 19:15.821
Foreman's got
personality issues,

19:15.947 --> 19:17.739
so you're gonna step in?

19:18.032 --> 19:20.951
Patient doesn't like Foreman.
I'm interested.

19:24.789 --> 19:29.960
Fatigue, hair loss, possibility of
damage to the lungs, infertility.

19:31.462 --> 19:33.839
All possible side effects
of radiation.

19:35.424 --> 19:37.050
Why don't you like
Dr. Foreman?

19:39.303 --> 19:41.054
He thinks he's better
than he is.

19:41.681 --> 19:42.639
How good is he?

19:42.890 --> 19:43.974
I don't know.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.976
Can we get back
to what's wrong with me?

19:46.102 --> 19:49.604
There's a small possibility of leukemia
at some time in the future.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.565
Hardly worth mentioning.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.984
You can't say he thinks
he's better than he is

19:54.110 --> 19:55.735
if you don't know
how good he is.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.030
No one's as good
as he thinks he is.

19:59.282 --> 20:00.490
I am.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.158
You might also get cataracts.

20:02.952 --> 20:04.202
Sign here.

20:05.037 --> 20:06.496
I don't know.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.623
You're telling me
how dangerous this is.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.000
We're saving your life.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.587
We're that good. Sign there.

20:15.756 --> 20:16.965
I can't decide.

20:19.343 --> 20:22.762
Would you rather
a pencil or a pen?

20:25.558 --> 20:29.060
Who's the better James Bond,
Sean Connery or Daniel Craig?

20:32.064 --> 20:33.565
You see?
That's not even a decision.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.859
It's happening again.

20:35.985 --> 20:39.487
I can't. I can't.

21:02.678 --> 21:05.347
Up her blood thinners
and get her down to Radiology.

21:05.556 --> 21:07.349
The attack will be over
in 20 minutes.

21:07.934 --> 21:09.059
Then she'll wanna sign this.

21:19.487 --> 21:22.489
Bonnie called last night
to talk about the dog.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.658
Your name came up.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.534
Good Lord!

21:26.869 --> 21:28.036
How do you still have teeth?

21:28.412 --> 21:30.872
She's the worst realtor
in New Jersey.

21:31.165 --> 21:32.999
What is this? Escalation?

21:33.209 --> 21:35.835
I go out with Cuddy,
you hook up with my ex?

21:35.962 --> 21:37.963
I don't even know what
that's designed to do.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.047
You're an addict.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.716
I'm saving you from yourself.

21:41.842 --> 21:44.094
By condo shopping?
Thank you.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.137
If I can figure out
where you keep going wrong,

21:46.263 --> 21:47.847
then I can nip this
Cuddy thing in the bud

21:47.974 --> 21:50.558
before she becomes
the fourth ex-Mrs. Wilson.

21:50.810 --> 21:54.062
Yes. I was worried there was
no way to stop that train.

21:54.188 --> 21:55.939
You have to have sex
with Cuddy.

21:58.025 --> 22:00.652
Wait. To stop the train?

22:03.197 --> 22:06.032
Bonnie said I'm bad in bed?

22:06.325 --> 22:07.325
Huh?

22:08.911 --> 22:10.412
Yeah. She also said

22:10.538 --> 22:12.831
that if she'd slept with you
before she liked you

22:12.957 --> 22:13.915
then it would've made it
easier to handle

22:14.041 --> 22:17.002
when you turned into the sorry bastard
who left her alone.

22:21.882 --> 22:24.050
I told her you were
wasting her time, by the way.

22:24.343 --> 22:26.219
You think that's
gonna stop her?

22:26.345 --> 22:28.680
The woman's the worst
realtor in New Jersey.

22:30.891 --> 22:31.975
How do you feel?

22:32.101 --> 22:33.143
Weak.

22:33.269 --> 22:34.227
Sleeping a lot.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.603
That's normal
after radiation.

22:36.188 --> 22:37.063
Deep breath.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.483
A little queasy, too.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.569
When I feel sick to my stomach

22:42.695 --> 22:45.822
I always want
vanilla ice cream. It's soothing.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.657
It's best to stick
with liquids for now.

22:50.244 --> 22:51.745
I'm getting a murmur.

22:53.247 --> 22:55.999
Oh, my arm! It's hurting me!

22:56.125 --> 22:58.168
Take it off! Take it off!

23:01.714 --> 23:02.881
Oh, my God!

23:11.891 --> 23:13.391
Pain is the issue.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.727
Just the pressure
of the BP cuff

23:15.853 --> 23:17.228
was enough
to start her screaming.

23:17.521 --> 23:18.813
That's not cancer.

23:19.273 --> 23:20.732
It sounds like...

23:23.152 --> 23:24.444
Sounds like she's septic.

23:28.032 --> 23:30.200
A lot of things
can cause pain.

23:30.451 --> 23:31.993
How much pain?

23:32.703 --> 23:33.995
Too much.

23:37.541 --> 23:40.543
It's not cancer.
It's not autoimmune.

23:41.253 --> 23:44.172
It's an infection and
we fried her immune system.

23:44.298 --> 23:46.800
But she had no fever.
Her LP was clear.

23:48.010 --> 23:50.720
Do an echo.
Confirm it's in the heart.

23:53.808 --> 23:57.060
And then I'll tell our patient
that we just killed her.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.939
I'll tell her.

24:10.574 --> 24:13.284
Hi. You haven't been
returning my phone calls.

24:14.453 --> 24:15.453
I'm busy.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.956
Well, but if you
have half an hour

24:18.082 --> 24:19.082
a little later this afternoon,

24:19.208 --> 24:22.043
I just found this unit
ten minutes from here.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.503
It hasn't been
on the market yet.

24:23.629 --> 24:25.255
I'm off the market for condos.

24:26.715 --> 24:27.549
James was right?

24:29.301 --> 24:31.678
I never had the teeniest chance
of selling you anything?

24:31.846 --> 24:32.679
Of course he was right.

24:33.722 --> 24:36.766
Wilson doesn't stop giving good advice
just 'cause you're divorced.

24:36.892 --> 24:40.520
He's compulsive about remaining
on good terms with his exes.

24:46.861 --> 24:49.320
Do you wanna know why
I named that dog Hector?

24:49.446 --> 24:50.613
No. Let's keep it a mystery.

24:50.739 --> 24:52.866
Because even when
he was a puppy,

24:52.992 --> 24:55.118
he was the worst-tempered dog
we'd ever seen.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.828
He was supposed
to be house-trained.

24:56.954 --> 24:59.372
He'd pee on the carpet
every morning.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.584
When we had people over,
he had to nip at their ankles.

25:02.710 --> 25:07.005
"Hector does go rug" is an anagram
for "Doctor Greg House".

25:07.131 --> 25:08.798
That's how early in the marriage
I resented you.

25:09.133 --> 25:11.968
Wow. Did I ever waste money
on that place setting.

25:12.094 --> 25:13.595
James at least
had the decency

25:13.721 --> 25:14.888
to feel guilty
when he hurt me.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.764
Whereas I didn't hurt you.

25:16.932 --> 25:20.018
I didn't even marry you, cleverly
hoping to avoid moments like this one.

25:20.227 --> 25:23.271
You always needed him and
he was always there for you.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.106
If you keep yelling,
I'll think you'll owe me sex.

25:25.232 --> 25:27.192
You knew he had a wife waiting at home.
You didn't care.

25:28.402 --> 25:30.862
Now, I'm not saying you broke up the
marriage, but you didn't help.

25:36.660 --> 25:39.537
First, "Hector does go rug"
is a lame anagram.

25:39.663 --> 25:43.041
You want a better one for Gregory House?
"Huge ego. Sorry."

25:43.167 --> 25:44.834
Second, find a new career.

25:45.085 --> 25:46.169
You're never gonna
sell anybody

25:46.295 --> 25:47.670
if you let them
control the agenda.

25:47.796 --> 25:49.172
And third,
I don't owe you anything.

25:49.298 --> 25:52.258
I'm not Wilson. I'm not gonna buy a
condo just to make you feel better.

26:01.894 --> 26:03.102
You okay?

26:03.229 --> 26:04.229
Yeah.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.773
Tell me how to do this.

26:06.982 --> 26:08.733
House says
people thank you after.

26:08.859 --> 26:10.068
It's not typical.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.405
I already killed this woman.

26:15.407 --> 26:17.909
All I can do now
is not make any more mistakes.

26:23.207 --> 26:26.209
First of all, stop thinking
you can minimize the hurt.

26:26.752 --> 26:28.753
A lot of people are afraid
of the word "dying."

26:28.879 --> 26:31.631
If you pussyfoot around it,
she's not going to read your mind.

26:31.757 --> 26:33.383
- Okay.
- No, it's not.

26:33.884 --> 26:34.968
When you look in her face,

26:35.094 --> 26:37.971
you're gonna feel
the instinct to temporize.

26:38.097 --> 26:39.013
Crush it.

26:39.473 --> 26:40.515
Yeah.

26:40.891 --> 26:42.225
Then wait.

26:42.768 --> 26:45.019
Give her time
to process the news.

26:45.980 --> 26:49.023
Let her know you'll be with her
through all of it.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.401
Wait till she's
done thinking,

26:51.527 --> 26:52.777
till she meets
your eyes again.

26:52.903 --> 26:56.239
Then if you feel it's appropriate,
you can touch her.

26:56.365 --> 26:58.825
Maybe put your hand
on her arm like this.

27:00.035 --> 27:02.787
Let her know she's still connected
to another human being.

27:03.539 --> 27:05.206
You've got this down
to a science.

27:07.001 --> 27:08.293
You're freaking out.

27:08.419 --> 27:10.086
- I told you...
- Give her what she needs.

27:10.963 --> 27:13.131
What she doesn't need
is a doctor who's not there with her

27:13.257 --> 27:15.425
because he made
the wrong call.

27:15.551 --> 27:18.678
You are freaking out.
You should be freaking out.

27:19.930 --> 27:21.180
I won't let her see it.

27:22.933 --> 27:24.267
Let her see it.

27:32.693 --> 27:33.693
Hey.

27:34.695 --> 27:36.321
How come no mask?

27:38.574 --> 27:39.782
We think...

27:42.328 --> 27:43.453
You have an infection.

27:44.163 --> 27:45.997
Didn't the radiation work?

27:46.623 --> 27:48.833
It did what it was
supposed to do.

27:52.588 --> 27:53.921
You're dying.

27:55.966 --> 27:58.885
What do you mean? Like things are bad
and that someday I'm gonna...

28:00.971 --> 28:05.975
How much time?

28:06.101 --> 28:07.060
We can't know exactly.

28:07.186 --> 28:08.436
A year?

28:10.189 --> 28:11.606
Less than a year?

28:12.107 --> 28:13.608
Less than 24 hours.

28:14.777 --> 28:16.235
I don't understand.

28:16.362 --> 28:18.905
Why are you saying this to me?
You're trying to scare me?

28:19.031 --> 28:20.365
Why would you do that?

28:20.574 --> 28:21.616
I'm sorry.

28:21.742 --> 28:22.909
It's true.

28:23.285 --> 28:27.497
How bad is this cancer?
Yesterday you thought I had a chance.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.499
You don't have cancer.

28:31.085 --> 28:32.835
You came in with an infection.

28:34.004 --> 28:36.631
- We didn't catch it.
- What kind of infection?

28:36.757 --> 28:37.590
Doesn't matter.

28:39.218 --> 28:42.345
Radiation was the worst thing
we could have done.

28:43.138 --> 28:45.848
We destroyed the part of your body
that was fighting it off.

28:46.725 --> 28:47.892
It's spread to your heart.

28:48.018 --> 28:49.894
Then give me drugs.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.270
They have drugs
for infections.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.773
Antibiotics work
with the immune system,

28:53.899 --> 28:56.901
but your immune system
is nonexistent because of the radiation.

28:57.027 --> 29:00.488
If it's my heart,
you can get me a new heart.

29:00.614 --> 29:02.824
People have heart transplants
all the time!

29:02.950 --> 29:04.200
It wouldn't help.

29:06.078 --> 29:08.413
The infection's everywhere.

29:10.999 --> 29:14.544
There's nothing
anybody can do.

29:25.431 --> 29:26.597
I'm so sorry.

29:32.563 --> 29:34.605
We'll call your grandparents.

29:36.900 --> 29:39.944
Get the hell away from me!
Get out!

29:40.070 --> 29:41.154
Get out!

30:21.820 --> 30:23.321
I think it's broken.

30:23.447 --> 30:26.532
Nothing like a melodramatic
gesture to solve everything.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.743
We were wrong, too.
Steroids wouldn't have helped her.

30:28.869 --> 30:31.996
I didn't not help her.
I actually pulled the trigger.

30:32.122 --> 30:34.373
There's nothing left
for you to do.

30:34.500 --> 30:35.458
One of us could
go home with...

30:35.584 --> 30:37.126
You're trying to
make me feel better?

30:37.252 --> 30:39.170
- Yeah.
- I killed a woman.

30:39.296 --> 30:40.421
Don't you think
it's appropriate

30:40.547 --> 30:43.216
I feel like crap
for at least a little while?

30:43.342 --> 30:45.301
It won't help her.

30:48.764 --> 30:49.805
Where is he?

30:49.932 --> 30:51.182
He went to the ICU.

30:57.147 --> 30:59.148
What are you doing?

30:59.274 --> 31:00.816
Prepping for an aspiration.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.151
We still don't know
what infection...

31:02.277 --> 31:03.110
It's not gonna help her.

31:03.237 --> 31:04.487
It's not gonna hurt her.

31:04.613 --> 31:05.947
Well, it is gonna hurt her
but it's not gonna...

31:06.073 --> 31:07.114
No.

31:07.783 --> 31:08.783
This'll just take
a few minutes.

31:08.909 --> 31:09.867
I'll grab a piece
of an abscess,

31:09.993 --> 31:11.536
- some pus...
- You really don't care.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.412
You really don't care
why she's gonna be dead.

31:13.622 --> 31:14.789
She's gonna be dead because...

31:14.915 --> 31:15.915
What?

31:17.626 --> 31:20.753
What did we screw up?
What did we miss?

31:22.339 --> 31:23.881
I need to know.

31:25.092 --> 31:26.133
You'll have to wait.

31:35.769 --> 31:37.186
We're moving her back
to her room.

31:37.312 --> 31:40.439
Patients who've had total body radiation
have to stay in ICU.

31:40.566 --> 31:42.149
ICU isn't going to help her.

31:42.276 --> 31:43.317
Let's give her some privacy.

31:55.956 --> 31:57.873
What do you want?

31:58.584 --> 32:00.501
Want to see
if I'm dying on schedule?

32:03.880 --> 32:06.090
Or do you want me
to tell you it's all right,

32:06.216 --> 32:07.341
I'm okay with it?

32:08.260 --> 32:11.554
I'd like your forgiveness.
I don't expect it.

32:12.889 --> 32:14.140
Good.

32:14.266 --> 32:18.060
'Cause this isn't like you ran your cart
into mine at the supermarket.

32:18.979 --> 32:20.187
No.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.982
Your grandparents
haven't arrived yet.

32:23.984 --> 32:26.152
If they don't make it on time,

32:27.112 --> 32:29.113
is there anything
you'd like me to tell them?

32:29.239 --> 32:30.489
I never really knew them.

32:32.451 --> 32:35.161
You got any friends
you want me to call?

32:36.496 --> 32:37.955
It's the middle of the night.

32:38.915 --> 32:41.334
They're not the kind of friends you ask
to help you move,

32:41.460 --> 32:43.919
never mind watch you die.

32:47.007 --> 32:48.507
I never did much.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.886
No kid to leave behind.

32:53.930 --> 32:56.515
When I go, the world's
not gonna be any different.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.771
Kind of a relief for you, huh?

33:41.728 --> 33:44.522
You were right about me.

33:45.107 --> 33:46.941
Yeah? Which time?

33:51.988 --> 33:53.989
I had a problem with you.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.869
But you were wrong, too.

34:00.288 --> 34:02.248
I've made some bad decisions.

34:03.667 --> 34:06.460
Stole cars. Robbed houses.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.587
Killed a woman.

34:13.385 --> 34:14.844
But then I got another chance.

34:16.263 --> 34:20.266
Left home, went to college,
entered a whole other world.

34:21.017 --> 34:24.895
And there's some part of me
I can't get rid of, always thinks,

34:25.689 --> 34:31.318
if I'm not the smartest,
if I'm not the first, everywhere I go

34:32.988 --> 34:35.197
they'll figure out
I'm not supposed to be here.

34:37.117 --> 34:38.492
They'll send me back.

34:39.619 --> 34:41.412
You know that's
not gonna happen.

34:41.997 --> 34:42.997
You're out.

34:43.123 --> 34:44.582
I'll never be out of there.

34:48.253 --> 34:51.881
When I came home that last Christmas
I was in college,

34:52.924 --> 34:55.426
it was like the rooms

34:56.678 --> 34:58.971
felt so small.

35:00.015 --> 35:01.432
It was suffocating.

35:02.350 --> 35:05.603
But when I was standing
on the stoop saying goodbye,

35:07.105 --> 35:08.939
my mom put her arms around me.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.487
That was...

35:15.322 --> 35:17.573
That was the last time
I ever felt at home.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.874
I only put distance

35:28.168 --> 35:31.545
between you and me because I know
there isn't any.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.966
You were right about me, too.

35:39.054 --> 35:44.058
That stuff about the system being
against people like me...

35:44.184 --> 35:46.602
I know it's crap.

35:46.728 --> 35:50.523
I mean, it's true
but it's also crap.

35:51.358 --> 35:55.528
I just wasn't ready
to try again.

35:56.863 --> 35:59.782
But I always thought
I was young.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.952
I had time.

36:17.801 --> 36:20.177
Aren't you ever gonna leave?

36:21.513 --> 36:22.680
No.

36:56.840 --> 37:00.551
- Yeah?
- Time of death, 3:35.

37:00.969 --> 37:02.177
Do whatever you want.

37:31.958 --> 37:34.209
You wanna go and get drunk?

37:34.336 --> 37:35.461
No, thanks.

37:36.004 --> 37:37.546
I've got paperwork.

37:42.177 --> 37:43.761
Listen, I don't...

37:43.887 --> 37:46.805
I don't know what I believe
but sometimes I need to think

37:46.932 --> 37:48.933
there's something out there
paying attention.

37:50.018 --> 37:51.602
So when I can't
talk to anybody,

37:51.728 --> 37:55.648
I talk to God and pretend
somebody's listening.

37:57.943 --> 37:59.985
We were all wrong. You know?

38:00.904 --> 38:02.237
Even House was wrong.

38:04.741 --> 38:05.783
I know.

38:51.955 --> 38:54.164
I got your consent.

38:56.835 --> 38:58.335
Her bra hook.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.587
What?

39:00.714 --> 39:03.090
She scratched herself
with her bra hook.

39:06.094 --> 39:08.178
That's how
the infection got in.

39:16.354 --> 39:17.896
Staph aureus.

39:19.899 --> 39:22.276
She died from a simple
staph infection?

39:23.778 --> 39:26.196
That and some bad decisions.

39:34.039 --> 39:35.831
I'll be outside.

39:50.388 --> 39:53.932
Go home. Have a few drinks.
Go to sleep.

39:54.059 --> 39:57.311
Get up tomorrow.
And do it all over.

39:57.437 --> 39:58.270
Only better.

40:00.982 --> 40:03.567
If you need absolution,
go to a priest

40:04.527 --> 40:06.779
or give alms to the poor.

40:07.739 --> 40:09.615
Whatever ritual comforts you.

40:10.033 --> 40:11.700
I killed her.

40:12.952 --> 40:14.244
Yeah. Me, too.

40:15.455 --> 40:18.707
This wasn't, "Oh, I should've thought
of that idea sooner."

40:19.542 --> 40:21.835
This wasn't messing up
a dosage!

40:21.961 --> 40:24.713
We see a disease rushing down
on someone like a train,

40:25.173 --> 40:26.840
we can't always get them
out of the way!

40:28.843 --> 40:30.761
But this wasn't that.

40:32.013 --> 40:33.013
No.

40:34.140 --> 40:35.933
And you'll do it again.

40:38.853 --> 40:42.147
For a lot of doctors,

40:42.273 --> 40:46.151
this would be
a once-in-a-lifetime mistake.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.154
But we're not
a lot of doctors.

40:50.073 --> 40:53.033
And we'll save more patients
than the guy down the street

40:53.993 --> 40:54.827
but a few of the ones
that he'd save

40:54.953 --> 40:58.705
by doing what
everyone else does, we will lose.

40:59.541 --> 41:00.999
So you're giving me numbers.

41:01.584 --> 41:03.168
Because they don't lie.

41:05.421 --> 41:07.172
I can't forgive you, Foreman.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.592
Because there's
nothing to forgive.

41:30.155 --> 41:31.738
What did you tell him?

41:31.865 --> 41:33.615
That guilt is irrelevant.

41:33.908 --> 41:35.784
You wanna get
something to eat?

41:36.035 --> 41:37.494
Can't.

41:37.620 --> 41:39.079
Got a dog waiting at home.

41:53.595 --> 41:55.012
What's wrong?

41:58.266 --> 41:59.975
I did something bad, Mom.

42:02.478 --> 42:03.604
I hurt somebody.

42:04.063 --> 42:05.689
It wasn't your fault.

42:08.526 --> 42:09.359
It was.

42:09.861 --> 42:12.279
Then I forgive you.

42:12.405 --> 42:13.947
I forgive you.

42:19.996 --> 42:22.539
I can see from your face

42:24.167 --> 42:27.586
you'd never hurt anybody
on purpose.

42:35.261 --> 42:36.970
Do you know who I am, Mom?

42:39.766 --> 42:41.308
It's Eric.

42:43.853 --> 42:45.312
Of course.

42:49.108 --> 42:51.276
My little boy's name is Eric.
