00:01.635 --> 00:03.335
(bell rings)

00:05.639 --> 00:06.872
Ha ha ha ha ha!

00:06.874 --> 00:08.607
What's the hurry, nerd?

00:08.609 --> 00:10.442
This year's moisture crop
is in!

00:10.444 --> 00:12.711
I'd kick your ass
if I wasn't so confused!

00:12.713 --> 00:14.446
Damn it.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.682
I should have said, "Your mom's
moisture crop is in."

00:16.684 --> 00:18.517
Next time.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.654
(propulsion engine whines)

00:22.656 --> 00:25.324
¶¶

00:25.326 --> 00:29.128
(speaking Japanese)

00:29.130 --> 00:30.896
Toshi, before we get
into any of that,

00:30.898 --> 00:33.165
I'm gonna need to sample
this year's moisture crop.

00:33.167 --> 00:34.833
(slurps) Mmm!

00:34.835 --> 00:36.201
Like mother's milk.

00:43.511 --> 00:46.578
My space blazer --
you got the stain out!

00:46.580 --> 00:48.147
Yes, sir.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.482
And this little guy
spit up on it.

00:50.484 --> 00:51.884
Sometimes I just want to...

00:51.886 --> 00:53.318
(imitates bone cracking)

00:53.320 --> 00:57.056
Kidding! You're papa's
little everythings.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.661
Snotron, buddy, I'd love
to see that health grade

01:02.663 --> 01:04.730
go up from a "C" minus
to an "A."

01:04.732 --> 01:05.998
Or...

01:06.000 --> 01:09.234
How about a free drink
for the mayor?

01:09.236 --> 01:11.770
A Capri two suns?

01:11.772 --> 01:14.540
Mr. Mayor, we're back from
the dilithium crystal mine.

01:14.542 --> 01:16.275
What a haul!

01:16.277 --> 01:18.343
This will power
the colony for months!

01:18.345 --> 01:20.679
MAN: God, what are you
children doing?

01:20.681 --> 01:23.882
And why do you have
that wheelbarrow

01:23.884 --> 01:25.884
full of dog turds?

01:25.886 --> 01:28.987
Dilithium straight
from the source!

01:30.224 --> 01:32.758
I forgot bags,
so I'm gonna let this go,

01:32.760 --> 01:35.894
but do not touch
my dog's asshole.

01:35.896 --> 01:39.264
(imitating jet engine)

01:39.266 --> 01:41.767
(patriotic music plays)

01:41.769 --> 01:45.037
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

01:45.039 --> 01:48.407
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

01:48.409 --> 01:51.777
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

01:51.779 --> 01:55.848
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

01:57.718 --> 02:01.053
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

02:01.055 --> 02:03.322
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:03.324 --> 02:04.656
Aah!

02:05.893 --> 02:09.328
¶<i> Good morning, U.S.A.</i> ¶

02:09.330 --> 02:11.797
(birds chirping)

02:11.799 --> 02:15.667
Stan, come see the new curtains
for over the kitchen sink!

02:15.669 --> 02:17.169
They're gorgeous!

02:18.839 --> 02:20.405
Great news!

02:20.407 --> 02:22.841
I found the perfect place
to put my new shark tank.

02:22.843 --> 02:24.676
I got it from
a drug lord we busted.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.311
But that's where
I want to hang these.

02:26.313 --> 02:27.613
Well, you can't.

02:27.615 --> 02:29.181
You don't put curtains
on a shark tank,

02:29.183 --> 02:31.183
because there's never a time
you don't want to see them.

02:31.185 --> 02:33.152
But where am I gonna
do the dishes?

02:33.154 --> 02:34.653
Use our new lawn sink.

02:37.158 --> 02:38.824
Ugh.

02:38.826 --> 02:42.361
Mom, Jeff and I are headed out
to pick up some cho-nuts.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.962
They're the hot new dessert.

02:43.964 --> 02:46.465
Solid chocolate in
the shape of a doughnut.

02:46.467 --> 02:48.867
Oh! I've actually been dying
to try those.

02:48.869 --> 02:50.669
Oh, well --
I'm not inviting you.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.605
It's just I was supposed to pick
up Steve at the park at 4:00.

02:53.607 --> 02:55.340
But now you have to...

02:55.342 --> 02:57.476
Because I'm doing
chocolate stuff.

02:57.478 --> 02:58.944
(sighs)

02:58.946 --> 03:01.380
I never get to do anything
I want around here.

03:01.382 --> 03:02.714
I know.

03:02.716 --> 03:04.716
And I'd love for you
to tell me all about it.

03:04.718 --> 03:06.818
But you can't.
What? Why not?

03:06.820 --> 03:09.388
Floor spaghetti.
Floor spaghetti?

03:15.729 --> 03:17.763
Floor spaghetti.

03:20.568 --> 03:22.968
¶¶

03:22.970 --> 03:25.537
Why don't you put something
on the jukebox?

03:27.408 --> 03:28.840
(beeping)

03:28.842 --> 03:31.677
¶ Doo doo doo,
doo doo doo ¶

03:31.679 --> 03:33.912
¶ Feel like makin' love ¶

03:33.914 --> 03:35.214
Steve, we've got to go.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.349
Dad needs me to pick up
aquarium rocks

03:37.351 --> 03:39.017
that match
his shark's eyes.

03:39.019 --> 03:41.420
But I'm LARPing.
What's LARPing?

03:41.422 --> 03:44.056
What's a LARP?
She doesn't -- I can't even...

03:44.058 --> 03:46.024
What did you do
in high school?

03:46.026 --> 03:48.727
Sorry, Steve,
I guess I was too busy

03:48.729 --> 03:51.263
scoring mad pole.

03:51.265 --> 03:52.598
Ugh.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.700
LARPing is
live action role-playing.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.835
We create characters
and then act out

03:56.837 --> 03:58.937
their actions in
a fictional setting.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.106
In our case,
we're space colonists.

04:01.108 --> 04:04.443
So you pretend to have
space battles?

04:04.445 --> 04:06.111
(scoffs) Battles?

04:06.113 --> 04:08.747
W-we don't have the stomach
for the horrors of war.

04:08.749 --> 04:10.682
You see, we're all fans
of "Star Wars,"

04:10.684 --> 04:13.352
specifically the first act
where Luke was a space farmer.

04:13.354 --> 04:17.055
The minute he left his home
world to explore his destiny,

04:17.057 --> 04:18.757
I completely checked out.

04:18.759 --> 04:21.360
Um, hello!
Know your audience!

04:21.362 --> 04:23.061
More farming, please.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.429
I don't get it.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.265
I just see a bunch of boxes
in a dog park.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.799
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:27.801 --> 04:29.301
You're breaking the number one
rule of LARPing.

04:29.303 --> 04:31.637
Never break the reality
by questioning the LARP.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.905
Oh, I get it!

04:33.907 --> 04:37.209
"LARP" stands
for something.

04:37.211 --> 04:39.711
(birds chirping)

04:39.713 --> 04:42.447
¶¶

04:42.449 --> 04:46.218
Oh-ho-ho-ho!
This dude is awesome!

04:46.220 --> 04:49.388
I'm surprised you're so cool
with all this fish death.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.822
Oh, yeah.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.958
Finally someone I can
relate to around here --

04:52.960 --> 04:55.227
another true alpha.

04:55.229 --> 04:57.629
Why are you always
handing me this?

04:57.631 --> 04:59.064
I don't want this.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.899
What's the shark up to?
Eating money.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.768
Between feeding him
and other expenses,

05:02.770 --> 05:04.803
he costs more per week
than I make,

05:04.805 --> 05:07.639
and I don't like to brag,
but I'm doing...medium.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.574
Stan, you shouldn't pay
for this yourself.

05:09.576 --> 05:11.143
Yeah, well,
who else would?

05:11.145 --> 05:13.278
All the people
who come to visit

05:13.280 --> 05:15.247
our new SeaWorld!

05:15.249 --> 05:18.517
Are you suggesting we franchise
a SeaWorld out of our home?

05:18.519 --> 05:20.952
Well, we'll obviously need
to change the name

05:20.954 --> 05:23.188
so we don't have to pay
SeaWorld, but, yes.

05:23.190 --> 05:25.324
You already have
the main attraction.

05:25.326 --> 05:26.958
Plus, you have
a talking fish!

05:26.960 --> 05:29.027
I've been working on
my stand-up routine.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.762
And I could be the trainer.

05:30.764 --> 05:33.365
I have a good rapport with
animals, especially marine life.

05:33.367 --> 05:36.034
It's true! She taught me
how to use TurboTax.

05:36.036 --> 05:38.270
We're basically there, Stan.

05:38.272 --> 05:39.538
Let's do it.

05:39.540 --> 05:41.106
It's the only way
to save my shark.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.808
(all cheering)

05:42.810 --> 05:44.643
Yay!
Okay, first things first.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.044
We're not a real business

05:46.046 --> 05:48.313
until we have
a 3-D printer, obviously.

05:48.315 --> 05:51.983
(gasps) We should advertise over
urinals in bars.

05:51.985 --> 05:55.120
According to all the empty
ad space over urinals,

05:55.122 --> 05:57.789
that's the number one place
to advertise.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.225
¶¶

06:00.227 --> 06:02.227
Now, I know a lot
of you are worried

06:02.229 --> 06:04.796
about the rising threat
of a mutant versus cyborg

06:04.798 --> 06:07.632
galactic holy war, but for now,

06:07.634 --> 06:10.535
let's enjoy our new shake shack!

06:10.537 --> 06:11.803
(all gasp)

06:11.805 --> 06:13.538
(speaking Japanese)

06:13.540 --> 06:16.575
Everyone calm down.
We have to keep the peace.

06:16.577 --> 06:18.076
I'll return this to...

06:18.078 --> 06:21.179
the others.

06:21.181 --> 06:23.181
Snot, where's Steve?

06:23.183 --> 06:25.817
He's off on
diplomatic business.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.686
If you're looking
to kill time,

06:27.688 --> 06:29.855
you could have a drink
at my cantina.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.890
Guy Fieri came in once.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.526
He emptied all our
salt shakers into his mouth

06:34.528 --> 06:36.528
and called us
a "local hot spot."

06:36.530 --> 06:38.230
(whistle blows)

06:38.232 --> 06:40.766
This field is for
J.V. football only, geek!

06:40.768 --> 06:43.769
Oh, I-I would never dream of
intruding on your territory.

06:43.771 --> 06:45.871
I-I've simply come
to return

06:45.873 --> 06:48.840
your spherical projectile.

06:48.842 --> 06:51.743
(laughing) Oh, my --
Who -- who am I kidding?

06:55.616 --> 06:57.382
You serve real booze?

06:57.384 --> 06:59.251
Yep.
It's everything left over

06:59.253 --> 07:01.887
from my dad's wake that
my uncle didn't steal.

07:01.889 --> 07:03.955
Dark.
Can I have a drink?

07:03.957 --> 07:06.391
You can have
anything you want.

07:06.393 --> 07:08.293
Anything I want.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.962
It's been a long time
since I've heard that.

07:10.964 --> 07:13.398
That's the beauty
of LARPing.

07:13.400 --> 07:14.800
Take Barry.

07:14.802 --> 07:17.235
At home, his mom won't let him
use the iron.

07:17.237 --> 07:21.606
Yet here, he runs a successful
imaginary dry cleaners.

07:21.608 --> 07:24.443
This is a place of dreams,

07:24.445 --> 07:28.113
where no one tells you how
to live your life but you.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.949
Wow!
That sounds really nice.

07:30.951 --> 07:33.952
At home, I'm such
a second-class citizen.

07:33.954 --> 07:36.121
I mean,
it's not like I'm asking

07:36.123 --> 07:38.824
to be treated like
a princess or anything.

07:38.826 --> 07:41.126
GIRL: I present
our new princess --

07:41.128 --> 07:43.428
Fran-cinatra!

07:43.430 --> 07:45.464
(all cheering)

07:47.901 --> 07:50.469
Thank you!
You're too kind.

07:50.471 --> 07:53.472
I don't want that thing.
Thank you.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.774
Mom?
SNOT: Hey, Stever-O!

07:55.776 --> 07:57.242
Can you believe it?

07:57.244 --> 08:00.278
The princess bumped me up
to a "B" minus!

08:00.280 --> 08:02.447
Now I can cater cyber-mitzvahs.

08:02.449 --> 08:04.583
But the city bylaws
say nothing

08:04.585 --> 08:07.352
about a princess having
jurisdictional authority

08:07.354 --> 08:08.653
over the health board.

08:08.655 --> 08:13.024
A princess has authority
over everything!

08:13.026 --> 08:14.993
(whooshing noise)

08:21.201 --> 08:24.603
It just seems like we
don't really need a princess

08:24.605 --> 08:27.439
since the mayor was going
such a<i> good job.</i>

08:27.441 --> 08:31.309
Remember, everybody, how happy
we were with just the mayor?

08:31.311 --> 08:34.346
You know what the princess
has been dying to try?

08:34.348 --> 08:36.781
That new cho-nut place.

08:36.783 --> 08:39.150
Who wants to accompany
their princess

08:39.152 --> 08:40.986
to the planet Choculus?!

08:40.988 --> 08:44.289
Yeah, we never go off-world,
right, guys?

08:44.291 --> 08:48.059
Now I'm LARPing as
IKEA furniture!

08:51.565 --> 08:54.132
Our first stop is
the international tank.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.534
These are Swedish fish.

08:55.536 --> 08:58.003
Their usual habitat
is a bag at 7-Eleven.

08:58.005 --> 09:01.006
Next, we have the rarest
fish known to man --

09:01.008 --> 09:02.240
the talking fish.

09:02.242 --> 09:04.409
So what's with kids
these days?

09:04.411 --> 09:06.244
Such little bitches.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.146
Playing games on their phone

09:08.148 --> 09:10.549
where the goal
is crushing candy?

09:10.551 --> 09:12.884
You know what I played
when I was a kid?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.352
Steal Grandpa's<i> Playboys.</i>

09:14.354 --> 09:17.689
And the goal
was to jerk off!

09:17.691 --> 09:21.026
Ha ha. Uh...

09:21.028 --> 09:24.229
Uh, hey, kids, how would you
like to swim with the dolphins?

09:24.231 --> 09:27.899
Real members of
the 1984 Miami Dolphins.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.768
Kowalski, go!

09:38.278 --> 09:40.412
Amazing creatures.

09:40.414 --> 09:42.547
They're actually
the second-smartest mammals

09:42.549 --> 09:44.716
on the planet --
due to their head injuries.

09:44.718 --> 09:46.284
Now, for the big finale...

09:46.286 --> 09:50.088
(singing "Jaws" theme)

09:50.090 --> 09:51.623
Shark!

09:51.625 --> 09:53.291
That's it?!

09:53.293 --> 09:57.295
My uncle's a drug dealer.
He has two just like this.

09:57.297 --> 09:58.630
This is bad.

09:58.632 --> 10:00.298
Don't worry, Stan,
I know his uncle.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.300
Small-time shit, no threat
to my crew at all.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.603
What?
No, we're hemorrhaging money.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.472
Maybe I should just
get rid of the shark.

10:07.474 --> 10:09.207
Or -- or you double down.

10:09.209 --> 10:11.876
Do I have your permission
to buy a whale?

10:11.878 --> 10:13.612
Always.

10:13.614 --> 10:14.946
(humming)

10:14.948 --> 10:16.915
I hope the laundry
monster's hungry.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.316
Wait, to do now?

10:18.318 --> 10:20.652
Yep, morale's been really
low around OceanLand,

10:20.654 --> 10:23.088
so we had ourselves
an old-fashioned chum fight.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.789
It did the trick.

10:24.791 --> 10:26.891
But I've been looking forward
to LARPing at the park.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.259
Not happening, Francine.

10:28.261 --> 10:30.228
See, you live in
a fantasy world,

10:30.230 --> 10:33.264
while I live in the real world
where I run a marine park

10:33.266 --> 10:36.001
out of my home to raise money
to save my shark.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.806
Steve!
Can you give me a hand

10:41.808 --> 10:44.275
so I won't have to miss
LARPing today?

10:44.277 --> 10:46.845
Ooh. I was gonna get there
a little early.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.013
Come on, Steve.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.948
Your princess
needs you here.

10:49.950 --> 10:52.450
Yeah, the thing is,
here you're not the princess.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.185
You're just a...

10:54.187 --> 10:56.621
bloody...
underwear cleaner.

10:56.623 --> 10:57.789
I don't know.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.992
¶¶

11:00.994 --> 11:02.560
(whistles)

11:04.665 --> 11:06.765
I need you to stop
whatever you're doing

11:06.767 --> 11:08.333
and have
these done by 5:00.

11:08.335 --> 11:09.768
Uh...

11:09.770 --> 11:12.170
This is real laundry.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.705
Take my spaceship.

11:15.876 --> 11:19.377
Princess, wasn't expecting
you to grace us so soon.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.780
May I query as to what
those boxes are for?

11:21.782 --> 11:23.348
Queer away, Steve.

11:23.350 --> 11:26.217
They're for expanding
the colony to other fields

11:26.219 --> 11:28.887
not covered in steaming
piles of crystals.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.123
Ooh!
Space mansions!

11:32.125 --> 11:33.825
Are you crazy?!

11:33.827 --> 11:36.795
If we expand, we'll intrude on
the J.V. football field.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.229
You're asking for war.

11:38.231 --> 11:41.666
Stop questioning your princess
and step aside.

11:41.668 --> 11:43.568
No! I've stood silent
too long!

11:43.570 --> 11:45.637
I should have spoken up
last week

11:45.639 --> 11:48.073
when you called
the sand worm worshippers,

11:48.075 --> 11:50.208
of which I am one,
a "fringe cult."

11:50.210 --> 11:52.544
But this endangers
everything we've built.

11:52.546 --> 11:53.878
You can't to this!

11:53.880 --> 11:56.548
No one says "can't"
to the princess.

11:56.550 --> 11:59.484
For your insolence,
I hereby banish you

11:59.486 --> 12:01.419
to the jungles of Gymnasia.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.755
Not the prison planet!

12:03.757 --> 12:07.225
No!

12:07.227 --> 12:09.094
Ducks are Green!

12:09.096 --> 12:12.330
Ty-Ty, go long!

12:12.332 --> 12:13.765
Oof!

12:13.767 --> 12:15.266
What the hell is this?!

12:15.268 --> 12:17.202
It's bad enough no one
comes to our games,

12:17.204 --> 12:19.337
and we don't get to practice
on the varsity field.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.573
We don't need your nerd crap
in our way!

12:21.575 --> 12:23.908
Our colony is under
new management,

12:23.910 --> 12:26.244
and like Charlotte,
North Carolina,

12:26.246 --> 12:27.779
we are both fast-growing

12:27.781 --> 12:29.781
and completely devoid
of culture.

12:29.783 --> 12:32.550
Did Charlotte, North Carolina,
just get dadded?

12:32.552 --> 12:36.387
No, Barry, "American Dad"
loves everyone now.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.223
<i> That's right, America.</i>

12:38.225 --> 12:41.126
<i> We want you to know</i>
<i> you are loved!</i>

12:41.128 --> 12:44.162
<i>Except for you, Bend, Oregon --</i>
<i> filthy gutter trash.</i>

12:46.366 --> 12:48.032
I know money's a concern,

12:48.034 --> 12:50.401
but I discovered that
when you open your search

12:50.403 --> 12:53.204
to whales with checkered pasts,
the price goes way down.

12:53.206 --> 12:56.641
So, is he dangerous?

12:56.643 --> 12:58.710
No, just a few
misunderstandings.

12:58.712 --> 13:01.112
But if it's against the rules
to kill a few people

13:01.114 --> 13:02.480
at a Canadian marine park,

13:02.482 --> 13:04.315
then you're gonna have
to fire me, too.

13:04.317 --> 13:08.787
No, you can't take them!
This is their home!

13:08.789 --> 13:11.055
(sobbing)

13:11.057 --> 13:12.957
They're gonna be so happy.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.793
You did such
a great job with them.

13:14.795 --> 13:16.828
We're gonna let you
train the new orca.

13:16.830 --> 13:18.596
(growling)
(chuckles)

13:18.598 --> 13:21.232
I-I mean, I didn't do
that great of a job.

13:21.234 --> 13:24.769
You're gonna love Killatun.
He's a sweetheart.

13:24.771 --> 13:27.305
Stan, he came with a Rolex!

13:27.307 --> 13:30.008
We're already making money
off this baby!

13:30.010 --> 13:32.143
I was thinking,
when we get back,

13:32.145 --> 13:35.680
I'd like to execute one citizen,
you know, as a show of power.

13:35.682 --> 13:38.183
Smart. I'll make a list
of potential candidates

13:38.185 --> 13:40.418
just after the colony
finishes burning.

13:40.420 --> 13:41.820
The colony!

13:41.822 --> 13:44.322
¶¶

13:47.294 --> 13:48.893
(tires squeal)

13:54.801 --> 13:56.668
No!

13:56.670 --> 14:00.171
Is there anything crueler
than when a father

14:00.173 --> 14:03.508
must rebuild his
dry cleaning business?!

14:04.778 --> 14:08.613
People of the outlands,
we demand space justice.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.815
Whoa! We're in
the middle of practice.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.650
Maybe you should practice

14:12.652 --> 14:15.353
rebuilding the colony
you destroyed.

14:15.355 --> 14:18.790
Look, lady, you can't put
your garbage on our field.

14:18.792 --> 14:21.159
And you can't order me around.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.727
I'm royalty.

14:22.729 --> 14:25.396
No, you're a sad housewife
who spends her days

14:25.398 --> 14:28.299
playing dress-up,
bossing around a bunch of geeks.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.535
You're...

14:30.537 --> 14:32.604
You're right.

14:34.741 --> 14:37.008
Now we have
nowhere to LARP!

14:37.010 --> 14:39.244
Well, at least we got
to LARP long enough

14:39.246 --> 14:41.880
for Cat Girl and Glove Nose
to permanently confuse

14:41.882 --> 14:44.415
what I consider sexual.

14:51.057 --> 14:52.523
I know I messed up.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.158
A cake gets messed up.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.060
A Quiznos bathroom
gets messed up.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.929
You destroyed
a galaxy, mother!

14:57.931 --> 15:00.531
I know you don't care,
but I needed that place.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.400
Steve, stop lecturing
your mother.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.002
It's Daddy's turn!

15:04.004 --> 15:06.070
Francine, how committed
are you to OceanLand?

15:06.072 --> 15:07.672
Well...
Because it seems

15:07.674 --> 15:10.541
you're two laundry loads
short of full commitment.

15:10.543 --> 15:13.344
You put your clothes in
the chum buckets...

15:13.346 --> 15:14.612
With the chum?

15:14.614 --> 15:16.848
Yeah, but you don't have
to wash the chum.

15:16.850 --> 15:20.852
I mean, unless...

15:20.854 --> 15:23.588
We'll get back to you
on the chum.

15:23.590 --> 15:26.925
I used to be a princess.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.593
Jeez.

15:29.963 --> 15:31.963
Hey, after a quick pow-wow,
we realized

15:31.965 --> 15:34.232
how ridiculous we were being
about the chum.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.768
Of course
we want it cleaned.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.272
Hey, Mom, I'm sorry.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.540
For what?

15:42.542 --> 15:44.542
I'm the one who messed up
your game.

15:44.544 --> 15:45.810
Destroyed our galaxy.

15:45.812 --> 15:48.146
But it only happened
because you found

15:48.148 --> 15:51.215
the true meaning of LARPing,
escaping from your life.

15:51.217 --> 15:54.452
Well, I guess there's
no escape for me anymore.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.154
You're right.

15:56.156 --> 15:59.824
It would be hard to escape
from this dungeon we're in.

15:59.826 --> 16:02.627
Because an ogre
locked us down here

16:02.629 --> 16:04.595
to wash his clothes
day and night!

16:04.597 --> 16:05.830
Yes!

16:05.832 --> 16:08.099
And when the work is done,

16:08.101 --> 16:10.902
that vile ogre
drags me to his bed

16:10.904 --> 16:13.404
and fumbles
with my bra strap

16:13.406 --> 16:16.975
until he gets frustrated
and asks me to do it.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.977
And then
the real work starts.

16:18.979 --> 16:21.079
And now my character
is totally deaf.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.915
A deaf slave, whistling his
tuneless laundry song.

16:23.917 --> 16:25.817
(whistling tunelessly)

16:25.819 --> 16:27.952
No, Steve,
you're not a slave.

16:27.954 --> 16:32.323
You're a twice-elected
moisture farm colony mayor,

16:32.325 --> 16:35.093
and you know what
a colony mayor needs?

16:35.095 --> 16:36.761
His colony.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.096
You're right!

16:38.098 --> 16:40.365
It's time for me to be a man
and reclaim

16:40.367 --> 16:43.167
my make-believe village
with the help of my mother.

16:43.169 --> 16:45.803
Okay, Killatun, let's...

16:45.805 --> 16:47.672
let's roll over.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.341
(applause)

16:55.181 --> 16:57.882
(snarls)

16:57.884 --> 17:00.485
Oh, my God, Stan,
we have to act fast!

17:00.487 --> 17:02.053
No!

17:04.224 --> 17:07.525
(crowd screaming)

17:07.527 --> 17:08.826
(smooches)

17:08.828 --> 17:10.661
(applause)
Wow.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.331
He's a sweetheart, folks.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.299
Wave to the crowd,
Killatun.

17:18.138 --> 17:20.405
(cheering)

17:21.508 --> 17:24.475
(screaming)

17:28.081 --> 17:30.048
(siren wails)

17:30.050 --> 17:31.549
I don't get it!
What happened?

17:31.551 --> 17:33.251
I may have an idea.

17:33.253 --> 17:36.020
In order to afford the whale --
who was great, right?

17:36.022 --> 17:38.489
Total pro, good value,
nice find, Roger, yay --

17:38.491 --> 17:40.091
We had to cut
a few corners.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.894
One of those corners
was real bleachers,

17:42.896 --> 17:45.363
so I just made bleachers
with the 3-D printer.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.998
I guess they just
can't get wet.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.599
Roger, I'm ruined!

17:48.601 --> 17:51.502
Stan, baby, you're not looking
at the big picture.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.204
I came into this
with nothing,

17:53.206 --> 17:56.240
and now I'm leaving with
a 3-D printer and a Rolex.

17:56.242 --> 17:58.409
A Rolex, Stan.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.844
A "Rodex"?

17:59.846 --> 18:02.547
This has been a disaster!

18:02.549 --> 18:04.415
Hut, hut!
Wait!

18:04.417 --> 18:06.350
Well, well, well.

18:06.352 --> 18:08.719
Someone wants to get
Korean barbecue

18:08.721 --> 18:10.221
with old Coach Milonis.

18:10.223 --> 18:13.724
I'm here to ask you to give
these kids the field back.

18:13.726 --> 18:16.627
What, so they can run around
in weird outfits

18:16.629 --> 18:18.062
playing make-believe?

18:18.064 --> 18:20.064
Yeah. Look,

18:20.066 --> 18:23.034
some kids dream
they're space colonists,

18:23.036 --> 18:24.368
and others, well,

18:24.370 --> 18:27.538
they dream about being
on varsity football.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.274
We all want to be
something we're not.

18:30.276 --> 18:33.478
So a housewife
gets to be a princess

18:33.480 --> 18:37.081
and a J.V. coach gets
to pretend anybody cares.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.717
(sighs) It's true.

18:39.719 --> 18:42.787
During games, I wear a big
headset like in the pros,

18:42.789 --> 18:44.822
but I'm just listening
to Phil Collins.

18:44.824 --> 18:46.390
That's okay!

18:46.392 --> 18:49.727
We just need to realize
we're in this together.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.429
And maybe...

18:51.431 --> 18:53.731
We can even help each other.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.467
Okay, guys, I know it's our
first time playing

18:56.469 --> 18:59.003
in front of a crowd,
but don't be nervous.

18:59.005 --> 19:00.905
It's just like any other game --

19:00.907 --> 19:03.107
except the entire galaxy
is watching.

19:03.109 --> 19:04.642
Break.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.345
Hut, hut, hike!

19:12.485 --> 19:14.318
(horn blares)

19:14.320 --> 19:15.987
(cheering)

19:15.989 --> 19:18.990
¶¶

19:18.992 --> 19:22.627
Princess, you've shown
the wisdom of a logic droid

19:22.629 --> 19:25.196
and the bravery
of a -- a...

19:25.198 --> 19:28.099
Oh, I don't know, let's say --
let's say moon lion.

19:28.101 --> 19:30.468
And for that,
we make you queen.

19:30.470 --> 19:33.137
With this crown,
I pronounce you --

19:33.139 --> 19:35.973
Wait!
Are those dilithium crystals?

19:35.975 --> 19:39.310
Nothing but the finest
for our queen.

19:39.312 --> 19:41.779
I just --
I just don't get it.

19:41.781 --> 19:43.981
There are
pine cones everywhere.

19:43.983 --> 19:45.983
You mean
barnathium crystals?

19:45.985 --> 19:47.318
Those are worthless.

19:47.320 --> 19:50.621
Well, now I must return
to my home world

19:50.623 --> 19:53.457
to restore order.

19:53.459 --> 19:56.561
I'll pick you up at 4:30,
Mr. Mayor.

20:02.468 --> 20:04.735
My shark just swam out
the front door.

20:04.737 --> 20:06.003
Did you set it free?

20:06.005 --> 20:07.572
Shut up and hang
these curtains.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.507
Whoa!
What's got into you?

20:09.509 --> 20:11.475
I'm queen of this castle.

20:11.477 --> 20:13.978
Now get to hanging.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.152
(sighs)

20:21.154 --> 20:23.087
I guess none of the husbands
in this neighborhood

20:23.089 --> 20:24.889
are getting a break today.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.565
You're free now!
Go!

20:38.204 --> 20:42.139
No, Kowalski,
y-you have to go.

20:44.510 --> 20:47.345
Get on!
Just -- just leave me alone!

20:50.917 --> 20:54.051
Get out of here,
you stupid fish!

20:54.053 --> 20:56.654
¶¶

21:02.195 --> 21:04.161
Bye, have a great time.
