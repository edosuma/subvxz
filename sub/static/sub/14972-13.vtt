WEBVTT

00:02.069 --> 00:02.468
<i> Previously on Van Helsing.</i>

00:02.470 --> 00:04.203
So we are really going for this?

00:04.205 --> 00:05.771
Not alone, we'll have help.

00:05.773 --> 00:07.606
From who? The resistance?

00:07.608 --> 00:09.041
Where is this friend of yours?

00:09.043 --> 00:10.275
Vanessa?

00:10.277 --> 00:11.477
I stole your file.

00:11.479 --> 00:12.711
What did it say?

00:12.713 --> 00:15.014
It was all blacked out, even
your real names was blacked out.

00:15.816 --> 00:17.049
Dylan, sheema,
they might be in there

00:17.051 --> 00:18.484
and they are counting on us.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.520
Excellent work, my son.

00:21.522 --> 00:24.023
I'm sorry, I had no choice.

00:24.025 --> 00:26.625
Aaaaargh!!!!

00:26.627 --> 00:30.162
You look just like your mother.

00:44.311 --> 00:47.312
( Heavy breathing )

01:01.028 --> 01:04.029
And so it begins.

01:07.168 --> 01:11.737
You're probably wondering
“what is beginning?”.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.139
Well, I can tell you.

01:14.141 --> 01:17.709
It is so much.

01:17.711 --> 01:20.045
Too much to bore you with.

01:20.047 --> 01:24.183
But you must know, it
is life-changing for us.

01:24.185 --> 01:25.751
And for you, too.

01:25.753 --> 01:29.121
I promise you that.

01:29.123 --> 01:32.191
You ask yourself
“what is this?

01:32.193 --> 01:34.393
Why did it happen to me?

01:34.395 --> 01:37.096
Who am I, really?”

01:37.098 --> 01:38.730
I understand.

01:38.732 --> 01:40.999
I understand perfectly.

01:41.001 --> 01:44.169
You are alone in the world.

01:44.171 --> 01:47.039
You are without your child,

01:47.041 --> 01:50.375
and you have powers you have
no understanding of.

01:50.377 --> 01:52.111
No matter.

01:52.113 --> 01:56.081
We all imagine we are alive
for some great reason.

01:56.083 --> 01:59.118
To change the world.

01:59.120 --> 02:04.389
But in your case,
this is truth.

02:04.391 --> 02:06.291
You are.

02:06.293 --> 02:10.095
You will.

02:10.097 --> 02:14.133
But you will not save it.

02:14.135 --> 02:17.136
You will not break free from
these chains

02:17.138 --> 02:20.172
and make things right
for mankind

02:20.174 --> 02:23.175
as the people have whispered.

02:26.113 --> 02:28.280
Things are right.

02:28.282 --> 02:31.150
Finally right.

02:31.152 --> 02:33.118
Right now.

02:33.120 --> 02:40.425
And you, my little dove,
will help make them better.

02:40.427 --> 02:45.998
Your blood, what
is inside you,

02:46.000 --> 02:49.768
even we do not know
the possibilities yet.

02:49.770 --> 02:52.271
But we will.

02:52.273 --> 02:55.274
No matter how long it takes.

02:55.276 --> 02:59.444
Or how painful it will be
for you.

02:59.446 --> 03:05.651
We will learn everything
there is to know about you.

03:05.653 --> 03:09.621
Starting with your name.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.490
Who are you, really?

03:11.492 --> 03:12.991
I know.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.594
You think you are some
Vanessa seward.

03:15.596 --> 03:20.065
But this is simply not true.

03:20.067 --> 03:25.737
From the moment I first
saw you, I knew.

03:25.739 --> 03:30.242
You are someone
so much greater.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.544
I have known you, your kind,

03:32.546 --> 03:35.214
for as long as I can remember.

03:35.216 --> 03:37.649
And now, here you are.

03:37.651 --> 03:40.152
The last of them.

03:40.154 --> 03:44.022
Well almost.

03:44.024 --> 03:46.058
You are a kind of royalty,

03:46.060 --> 03:49.228
and you deserve to know
the truth.

03:49.230 --> 03:52.531
You are one of them.

03:52.533 --> 03:56.468
You are a Van Helsing.

03:59.173 --> 04:02.107
But this will not save you.

04:02.109 --> 04:06.645
Perhaps you can take comfort
as your life leaves your body

04:06.647 --> 04:09.114
and you can say over to yourself

04:09.116 --> 04:13.619
as you pass on to the next life.

04:13.621 --> 04:16.588
I am a Van Helsing.

04:16.590 --> 04:21.159
I am a Van Helsing.

04:21.161 --> 04:23.428
<i> A Van Helsing!</i>

04:23.430 --> 04:25.697
<i> A Van Helsing!</i>

04:25.699 --> 04:30.335
<i> ( Laughs )</i>

04:30.337 --> 04:33.639
I am Vanessa seward.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.408
Vanessa seward.

04:36.410 --> 04:40.145
I'm Vanessa

04:40.147 --> 04:42.314
Vanessa seward.

04:42.316 --> 04:43.615
Vanessa seward.

04:45.452 --> 04:48.453
<i> I am Vanessa seward.</i>

04:48.455 --> 04:51.189
<i> Vanessa seward.</i>

04:51.191 --> 04:52.591
<i> I'm Vanessa.</i>

05:11.478 --> 05:14.012
Ah, there you are.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.180
Let me go.

05:15.182 --> 05:16.715
I'm sorry, what?

05:16.717 --> 05:18.116
Please help me.

05:18.118 --> 05:19.117
Oh, no.

05:19.119 --> 05:21.153
No one can help you now.

05:21.155 --> 05:23.288
Not even me.

05:23.290 --> 05:27.025
Especially not me.

05:27.027 --> 05:33.498
And even if I could,
i don't want to.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.535
I want to see inside you.

05:36.537 --> 05:39.705
Every little piece of you.

05:39.707 --> 05:44.443
Rip you apart and put you
back together again.

05:50.484 --> 05:53.352
You're insane.

05:53.354 --> 06:00.125
That... is one possibility.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.060
You might as well be
one of them.

06:02.062 --> 06:05.664
One day, with luck, yes,
i will be.

06:05.666 --> 06:07.199
We all will be.

06:07.201 --> 06:10.135
( Chuckles )

06:10.137 --> 06:14.406
With luck, and with you.

06:14.408 --> 06:19.444
There's no telling
what we'll find inside you.

06:19.446 --> 06:23.782
We'll be able to bring one
of their seed to full term.

06:23.784 --> 06:30.555
Create something new
and extraordinary.

06:30.557 --> 06:34.393
Did you know that they can't
procreate, these vampires?

06:34.395 --> 06:36.361
The females, I mean.

06:36.363 --> 06:42.033
So... fascinating.

06:42.035 --> 06:45.771
Your blood, as a weapon,

06:45.773 --> 06:49.408
we're helping to create
day-walkers,

06:49.410 --> 06:53.278
thereby eliminating
the need for all this pollution

06:53.280 --> 06:56.415
and waste to blot out
the sun.

06:56.417 --> 06:58.984
Or perhaps even a link
to eternal life,

06:58.986 --> 07:03.155
the one dream
they still chasing.

07:03.157 --> 07:07.092
Yes, they do age.

07:07.094 --> 07:08.460
Did you know that?

07:08.462 --> 07:11.163
It's true.

07:11.165 --> 07:14.766
They live hundreds of years

07:14.768 --> 07:20.572
but they all die in the end just
like you or me.

07:20.574 --> 07:24.476
It terrifies them.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.645
But even that might change.

07:26.647 --> 07:32.684
With just a drop of your blood
or one of your eggs.

07:32.686 --> 07:38.690
I can't wait to find out.

07:38.692 --> 07:44.663
That's it, tire yourself out,
that's good.

07:51.405 --> 07:54.306
Be patient.

07:54.308 --> 07:58.109
Wait for your chance.

08:21.668 --> 08:24.002
<i> ( Hissing )</i>

08:32.312 --> 08:34.679
As promised.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.214
Mohamad?

08:42.289 --> 08:43.488
Are you ok?

08:43.490 --> 08:44.489
Are you sure?

08:44.491 --> 08:46.658
They didn't hurt you?

08:46.660 --> 08:50.395
I missed you.

08:50.397 --> 08:54.366
I want the boy.

08:54.368 --> 08:57.002
In time.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.172
I can't breathe.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.641
I can't breathe.

09:02.643 --> 09:09.014
( Gasping )

09:46.053 --> 09:49.187
( Coughs )

09:49.189 --> 09:52.057
Pathetic bitch.

09:52.059 --> 09:55.260
She could taste freedom.

09:55.262 --> 10:00.098
It was right there.

10:00.100 --> 10:05.103
The first step in breaking
her spirit.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.073
The first of many such steps.

10:08.075 --> 10:11.142
( Groans )

10:13.614 --> 10:17.115
She has to do something now,

10:17.117 --> 10:19.618
don't you think?

10:19.620 --> 10:22.120
Mohamad?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.189
Sorry, what?

10:24.191 --> 10:26.091
<i> Rebecca?</i>

10:26.093 --> 10:28.526
<i> I've given her everything</i>
<i> she needs to know</i>

10:28.528 --> 10:30.629
<i> and she's acting like it</i>
<i> doesn't even matter.</i>

10:32.499 --> 10:34.232
So that's how you
got all this.

10:34.234 --> 10:38.036
The room, the food.

10:38.038 --> 10:41.006
By working with Rebecca.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.374
Of course.

10:43.477 --> 10:45.243
They don't give you something
for nothing, obviously.

10:45.245 --> 10:46.144
And we can stay here.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.412
Yeah, but that's-

10:47.414 --> 10:51.483
it's what? Just like
you working for Dmitri?

10:51.485 --> 10:52.317
I know.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.153
Yeah, but you got people
killed, sheema.

10:55.155 --> 10:58.056
Good people, by doing this.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.424
I know that.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.428
You don't have to say it to me,
i know what I've done.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.229
( Sighs )

11:04.231 --> 11:05.096
And?

11:05.098 --> 11:07.198
And- and you didn't?

11:07.200 --> 11:10.502
Nobody died because of you?

11:10.504 --> 11:14.506
But I did all of this shit,
all of this, to get you out.

11:14.508 --> 11:17.208
I don't want to get
out of here.

11:17.210 --> 11:22.781
I like it here.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.549
Ok.

11:24.551 --> 11:27.452
I'm gonna go get my stuff.

11:27.454 --> 11:29.421
Is it ok if I stay here
for the night?

11:29.423 --> 11:31.089
Of course.

11:31.091 --> 11:33.558
That's what I'm saying.

11:33.559 --> 11:36.026
Stay here with me
where it's safe.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.029
Yeah.

11:45.505 --> 11:47.539
We'll talk later.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.385
A good day, my dear?

12:00.387 --> 12:03.054
Productive?

12:03.056 --> 12:05.190
Informative.

12:05.192 --> 12:06.524
And you?

12:06.526 --> 12:07.726
The same.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.594
The very same.

12:12.566 --> 12:15.100
And you, antonasia.

12:15.102 --> 12:17.102
Dining with us today.

12:17.104 --> 12:19.137
So rare.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.371
Such a pleasure.

12:20.373 --> 12:23.041
I'm not here for the company.

12:51.238 --> 12:54.539
I am sorry to interrupt your...

12:54.541 --> 12:56.541
But you asked me to let you
know when we were ready

12:56.543 --> 12:59.144
to proceed with the
removal of her eggs.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.445
So soon?

13:00.447 --> 13:03.081
She's close to ovulating.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.583
It won't be long now.

13:05.585 --> 13:07.085
Who's sperm will you be using?

13:07.087 --> 13:08.119
Won't you need-

13:08.989 --> 13:12.557
I'm sure they will find
a suitable donor.

13:12.559 --> 13:15.093
Continue when you're ready,
doctor.

13:18.064 --> 13:20.999
I wonder who that will be.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.602
Any news on the resistance?

13:24.604 --> 13:27.138
Their movements against us?

13:27.140 --> 13:28.606
No.

13:28.608 --> 13:31.476
No, nothing yet.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.611
Nothing to report.

13:38.118 --> 13:42.620
I love watching you two lie
to one another.

13:42.622 --> 13:47.125
It makes me... happy.

14:10.383 --> 14:11.082
( Cocks gun )

14:11.084 --> 14:12.717
Woah.

14:12.719 --> 14:15.687
Sorry, habit.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.056
Impressive.

14:18.058 --> 14:19.991
You mind if I ask
where you're going?

14:19.993 --> 14:20.658
Back.

14:20.660 --> 14:21.192
Back?

14:21.528 --> 14:22.193
Back where?

14:22.195 --> 14:24.229
To the citadel.

14:24.231 --> 14:24.996
You're going back inside?

14:24.998 --> 14:26.664
Why?

14:26.666 --> 14:29.067
Well, rumour has it they
have the woman in there.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.501
I need to check it out before-

14:30.503 --> 14:32.070
if that's true we should be
attacking tonight.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.104
We should be going in there
right now.

14:33.106 --> 14:34.116
Do you have any idea what
they'll do to her

14:34.117 --> 14:35.127
if she's in there?

14:35.128 --> 14:36.138
Do you have any idea?

14:36.376 --> 14:37.075
Yeah.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.010
I have a pretty good idea.

14:45.385 --> 14:48.019
End of discussion.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.300
There you are.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.769
Feed.

15:04.771 --> 15:07.639
You need to be strong.

15:07.641 --> 15:10.041
You want to.

15:10.043 --> 15:13.678
So, feed.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.303
( Chuckles )

15:44.044 --> 15:50.481
Oh, I've seen
that look before.

15:50.483 --> 15:59.924
Your mother, she also wanted
to kill me.

15:59.926 --> 16:02.627
What do you know
about my mother?

16:05.031 --> 16:08.166
Soon, my angel.

16:08.168 --> 16:12.770
But first, feed.

16:12.772 --> 16:17.041
She will, when
she's hungry enough.

16:17.043 --> 16:19.777
And when she does, then
we'll know for sure what effect,

16:19.779 --> 16:24.282
if any, blood has
on her powers, if any.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.504
Hey, Vanessa?

17:29.015 --> 17:30.281
Go away.

17:30.283 --> 17:31.215
Please-

17:31.217 --> 17:32.016
traitor.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.018
Go away.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.120
Just listen to me
for a moment.

17:36.122 --> 17:38.723
What could you possibly say
to me?

17:50.203 --> 17:55.073
I trusted you, mohamad.

17:55.075 --> 17:57.141
I know.

17:57.143 --> 18:01.646
Like a few people
I've trusted in my life.

18:02.982 --> 18:05.049
I'm- I'm sorry.

18:08.354 --> 18:11.556
It's too late.

18:11.558 --> 18:15.059
I did what I had to do.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.394
I- I had to.

18:16.396 --> 18:20.765
No, you chose to.

18:20.767 --> 18:25.403
You chose to do it.

18:25.405 --> 18:30.475
And then you did it.

18:30.477 --> 18:34.712
After all those times when
you could have stopped.

18:34.714 --> 18:39.984
You just kept right on going.

18:39.986 --> 18:42.086
All the way to right here
and now,

18:42.088 --> 18:46.624
you walking in here to take
a look at me.

18:46.626 --> 18:51.462
Go on, mohamad.

18:51.464 --> 18:54.098
Take a look at me.

18:59.239 --> 19:01.639
It was for sheema.

19:06.146 --> 19:08.179
But now, she-

19:14.654 --> 19:18.022
what?

19:18.024 --> 19:20.992
Did they turn her?

19:20.994 --> 19:24.162
No.

19:24.164 --> 19:27.265
What then?

19:27.267 --> 19:31.135
She turned herself.

19:31.137 --> 19:34.472
She likes it here.

19:34.474 --> 19:36.307
Being with them.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.142
Working with them.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.747
I got here too late.

19:47.153 --> 19:49.320
Then I'm sorry for you.

19:52.659 --> 19:55.059
Why?

19:55.061 --> 19:57.495
Because you sold your soul
for nothing.

20:03.436 --> 20:06.637
Just... go.

20:08.675 --> 20:11.008
Vanessa...

20:13.580 --> 20:16.047
<i> At least look at me</i>
<i> one more time.</i>

20:17.650 --> 20:20.251
<i> Vanessa, please.</i>

21:08.067 --> 21:13.537
In case you get a chance
to get out of here.

21:13.539 --> 21:16.540
I'm so sorry.

21:51.744 --> 22:06.791
( Cries out )

22:47.266 --> 22:55.106
( Speaking Romanian )

22:55.108 --> 22:59.143
You're healing quite nicely.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.578
If your wounds would not
have healed over

23:00.580 --> 23:06.083
you would be dead now,
which would be such a pity.

23:18.097 --> 23:22.767
Your people have hunted us
through the centuries.

23:22.769 --> 23:24.702
Constantly.

23:24.704 --> 23:28.172
Relentlessly.

23:28.174 --> 23:34.512
I even knew your
great-great-great grandfather,

23:34.514 --> 23:36.614
Abraham.

23:36.616 --> 23:38.115
I admired him.

23:38.117 --> 23:40.317
Respected him.

23:40.319 --> 23:46.123
But alas, we were fated
to be adversaries.

23:46.125 --> 23:49.126
Your mother was no exception.

23:49.128 --> 23:51.228
A real warrior.

23:51.230 --> 23:55.166
Until she became full
with child.

23:55.168 --> 24:01.105
Then she became more fearful,
and secretive.

24:01.107 --> 24:05.075
When she learned the truth
about your father

24:05.077 --> 24:09.613
she even tried
to stop the birth.

24:09.615 --> 24:13.317
When she could not do this
she did the next best thing.

24:13.319 --> 24:15.219
She hid you.

24:15.221 --> 24:18.322
Right before she died.

24:18.324 --> 24:22.059
She hid you away from all of us.

24:26.666 --> 24:29.333
She loved you fiercely.

24:29.335 --> 24:32.603
She even gave her life
for you,

24:32.605 --> 24:34.405
so you could live in peace.

24:34.407 --> 24:37.341
For a time, at least.

24:37.343 --> 24:41.745
All of this for you.

24:41.747 --> 24:46.016
Well, for the family.

24:46.018 --> 24:49.119
The lineage.

24:49.121 --> 24:52.289
Van Helsing.

24:52.291 --> 24:59.997
And because of this,
everything is now possible.

25:04.704 --> 25:08.239
Everything.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.771
You doubled the guard.

25:40.773 --> 25:43.507
Had a hell of a time getting
back in here.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.013
That was Dmitri.

25:49.015 --> 25:50.748
I see.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.216
Why's that?

25:52.218 --> 25:53.350
Instinct.

25:53.352 --> 25:54.285
Intellect.

25:54.287 --> 25:55.219
Intuition.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.453
Fear.

25:57.523 --> 25:59.089
That too, although he doesn't
have too much of it.

25:59.091 --> 26:02.059
Oh, well he should.

26:02.061 --> 26:05.596
We're gonna take
this place down.

26:05.598 --> 26:07.565
You're gonna try.

26:07.567 --> 26:12.069
Yes, with your help.

26:12.071 --> 26:14.238
Perhaps.

26:18.344 --> 26:20.344
He has the girl now.

26:20.346 --> 26:22.246
Yeah, I heard that.

26:22.248 --> 26:26.383
But not from you.

26:26.385 --> 26:29.219
I had no way to get word
to you.

26:29.221 --> 26:35.326
So tell me, why do you need
my help if you have her?

26:35.328 --> 26:37.161
He has her.

26:37.163 --> 26:39.730
Not me.

26:39.732 --> 26:46.070
He won't let her
out of his sight.

26:46.072 --> 26:51.275
Somebody sounds
a little jealous.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.477
She's a lab rat to me.

26:53.479 --> 26:56.280
Nothing more.

26:56.282 --> 26:59.016
And to him?

26:59.018 --> 27:02.019
The citadel needs to be
attacked tomorrow.

27:02.021 --> 27:03.020
Ah.

27:03.022 --> 27:07.057
While his mind is...

27:07.059 --> 27:09.259
Elsewhere.

27:09.261 --> 27:13.030
Exactly.

27:13.032 --> 27:15.099
Just so we're on the same
path here, remind me again,

27:15.101 --> 27:17.568
what do I get out of this?

27:17.570 --> 27:21.639
An island off the coast
to yourselves.

27:21.641 --> 27:24.074
Off-limits to us.

27:24.076 --> 27:27.211
To any vampire.

27:27.213 --> 27:32.516
You can re-build your lives
there, without fear.

27:32.518 --> 27:35.619
Without my family.

27:35.621 --> 27:40.357
Forward is the only way
to go now.

27:40.359 --> 27:44.728
Yeah, maybe you're right.

27:44.730 --> 27:47.998
First thing's first.

27:48.000 --> 27:51.702
We need to get rid of
the dark one, Dmitri.

27:51.704 --> 27:54.171
Agreed.

27:57.343 --> 27:59.677
Tomorrow then.

28:01.447 --> 28:03.681
We're on.

30:14.980 --> 30:18.115
( Bowl clatters )

30:20.452 --> 30:30.527
( Gasping )

30:30.529 --> 30:40.337
( Gasping )

30:40.339 --> 30:43.407
My god, what's happening?

30:52.785 --> 30:55.118
And that's why I'm happy
to tell you,

30:55.120 --> 31:00.023
to tell all of you,
that now is finally time!

31:00.025 --> 31:03.627
It is time to strike back at
the forces of darkness

31:03.629 --> 31:04.995
and take back what is ours!

31:04.997 --> 31:05.729
Our place!

31:05.731 --> 31:08.098
Our people!

31:08.100 --> 31:10.133
There will never be
another shot like this.

31:10.135 --> 31:12.569
A coordinated attack
from many fronts.

31:12.571 --> 31:14.771
Twenty cells just like
this one

31:14.773 --> 31:18.075
converging on the
citadel at once.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.043
And once we blow the power
they have going into that place

31:20.045 --> 31:22.012
their defenses
will be cut in half.

31:22.014 --> 31:22.746
Half!

31:22.748 --> 31:24.081
Yeah.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.749
And that's it.

31:25.751 --> 31:27.150
That's our moment.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.621
We will spill in there like
a million insects

31:30.623 --> 31:34.391
from everywhere at once
and we will kill those things

31:34.393 --> 31:37.261
like they have been killing us
for three years,

31:37.263 --> 31:38.595
without mercy!

31:38.597 --> 31:41.565
( Crowd cheers in agreement )

31:41.567 --> 31:46.069
Without mercy, and no prisoners.

31:46.071 --> 31:48.772
You kill anything
within those walls.

31:48.774 --> 31:51.408
Anything and anyone!

31:55.047 --> 31:57.381
Yes, friend?

31:57.383 --> 32:01.251
You including Vanessa
in that?

32:01.253 --> 32:04.154
And you all know who I mean.

32:04.156 --> 32:05.422
She's the one you've
all whispered about

32:05.424 --> 32:09.126
since the rising.

32:09.128 --> 32:10.327
You mean her, too?

32:10.329 --> 32:11.762
I do.

32:11.764 --> 32:13.030
Now that she's in their hands

32:13.832 --> 32:15.766
she's nothing more
than a liability.

32:15.768 --> 32:17.134
Then I have to tell you that
when I go in there,

32:18.103 --> 32:19.469
I go in there to save her
and not to kill her.

32:20.639 --> 32:24.441
Well then you better hope to
god you get to her before we do.

32:39.491 --> 32:41.591
Well alright then.

32:41.593 --> 32:43.126
Who's with me?

32:43.128 --> 32:46.596
( Crowd cheers )

33:00.412 --> 33:01.945
Don't ask me to go with you.

33:01.947 --> 33:02.980
Sheema.

33:02.982 --> 33:04.047
Not if you're leaving.

33:04.049 --> 33:05.082
Look, you don't get it.

33:05.084 --> 33:06.550
We're not safe here.

33:06.552 --> 33:07.284
My god!

33:07.786 --> 33:09.486
You are so ungrateful!

33:09.488 --> 33:13.190
I betrayed my friend
to save you.

33:13.192 --> 33:15.325
After everything they've
given us?

33:15.327 --> 33:17.461
And- and now?

33:17.463 --> 33:20.697
And now, when things are
finally about to be alright,

33:20.699 --> 33:22.499
you want to go
back out there?

33:22.501 --> 33:23.567
On the road?

33:23.569 --> 33:25.335
Is that really what you want?

33:25.337 --> 33:27.404
Look, I know what
these people will do.

33:27.406 --> 33:28.505
What they're capable of.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.440
Yes, so do I.

33:30.442 --> 33:32.109
Look around you.

33:32.111 --> 33:34.978
Look at what I have here.

33:34.980 --> 33:37.247
All because I did things
for them

33:37.249 --> 33:40.984
and you did things for them.

33:40.986 --> 33:42.719
And look at what they
gave us in return.

33:42.721 --> 33:45.122
Our lives back.

33:48.160 --> 33:52.596
Ok, we'll talk about this
out there, where we're safe.

33:52.598 --> 33:54.131
I am safe, mohamad.

33:54.133 --> 33:55.065
Get out of my room.

33:55.067 --> 33:58.101
Leave my bag.

33:58.103 --> 34:01.338
Sheema, we have to go.

34:01.340 --> 34:03.073
You're crazy.

34:03.075 --> 34:04.641
This place is about
to be attacked

34:04.643 --> 34:06.710
and I'm gonna help stop them.

34:06.712 --> 34:12.115
I don't care what
you do anymore.

34:12.117 --> 34:15.552
I feel like I don't
even know you.

34:15.554 --> 34:19.056
We're going.

34:19.058 --> 34:20.190
Argh!!

34:23.128 --> 34:25.095
Argh!!

34:43.749 --> 34:45.549
For the pain.

35:04.736 --> 35:08.171
This shouldn't be too difficult.

35:08.173 --> 35:10.073
She's been with child before.

35:10.075 --> 35:12.742
This wasn't the plan.

35:12.744 --> 35:16.046
Your seed inside of that thing.

35:20.652 --> 35:23.353
( Gasps )

35:25.657 --> 35:29.025
She'll be the end of us.

35:29.027 --> 35:31.628
I can feel it.

35:31.630 --> 35:35.298
Continue, doctor.

35:35.300 --> 35:44.341
This might be the beginning
of something truly amazing.

35:44.343 --> 35:46.643
It really might be.

35:49.114 --> 35:51.515
Except you forgot one thing.

35:55.087 --> 36:02.425
( Grunts )

36:05.164 --> 36:08.165
I'm Vanessa Van Helsing!

36:23.048 --> 36:26.683
Now it's just you and me.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.486
( Laughs )

36:29.488 --> 36:32.522
This is gonna be fun.

36:40.098 --> 36:45.602
( Fighting grunts )

36:55.180 --> 36:57.647
( Fighting grunts )

37:58.243 --> 38:00.644
( Explosion )

38:02.381 --> 38:07.417
( Crowd attacking )

38:38.717 --> 38:41.284
( Chuckles )

38:43.055 --> 38:46.289
How did you manage to live
for 300 years?

38:46.291 --> 38:47.691
( Gun shot )

38:51.430 --> 38:52.595
Say goodbye, shithead.

38:52.597 --> 38:56.333
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

38:56.335 --> 38:58.201
There must be an answer here.

38:58.203 --> 39:00.136
Of course there is.

39:00.138 --> 39:02.138
Tell me someone betrayed me.

39:02.140 --> 39:04.541
That someone helped you.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.076
She did.

39:06.078 --> 39:07.444
Vanessa.

39:07.446 --> 39:09.012
No.

39:11.616 --> 39:13.016
Rebecca.

39:15.153 --> 39:17.053
Beauty.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.688
Mysterious and terrible.

39:18.690 --> 39:22.158
Yeah, well... say goodbye,
Dmitri.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.193
Save me a place in hell-

39:23.195 --> 39:26.129
what did she promise you?

39:26.131 --> 39:27.130
To rule by her side?

39:27.132 --> 39:28.498
No.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.033
And I never would.

39:30.035 --> 39:31.534
Smart man.

39:31.536 --> 39:33.103
Then what?

39:33.105 --> 39:34.537
A kingdom?

39:34.539 --> 39:37.173
Fox island.

39:37.175 --> 39:39.109
She offered me fox island.

39:39.111 --> 39:41.177
Fox island?

39:41.179 --> 39:42.746
That's right.

39:42.748 --> 39:45.982
( Laughs )

39:45.984 --> 39:47.584
What's so funny,
dead man?

39:47.586 --> 39:51.755
It does not exist.

39:51.757 --> 39:54.157
Bullshit.

39:54.159 --> 39:55.625
It was overrun.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.127
Infested.

39:57.129 --> 39:59.028
Like a leper colony.

39:59.030 --> 40:02.699
Years ago, just after
the rising began.

40:04.669 --> 40:07.637
No, I can offer you more.

40:07.639 --> 40:11.040
Much, much more.

40:11.042 --> 40:14.043
If only you allow me to speak.

40:19.985 --> 40:21.518
You got him!

40:21.520 --> 40:22.085
Kill him!

40:22.421 --> 40:24.020
Do it, now!
