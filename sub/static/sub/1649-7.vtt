WEBVTT

00:08.676 --> 00:11.008
( knife scraping )

00:26.819 --> 00:28.480
Hey.

00:28.654 --> 00:30.485
Where'd you go?

00:30.656 --> 00:32.521
I'm here.

01:09.695 --> 01:11.651
Um, guys.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.108
So...

01:21.082 --> 01:22.572
the barn is full
of walkers.

01:40.309 --> 01:42.300
(moaning)

02:01.455 --> 02:03.787
( growls )

02:05.793 --> 02:07.658
You cannot tell me
you're all right with this.

02:07.837 --> 02:10.249
No, I'm not, but we're guests here.
This isn't our land.

02:10.423 --> 02:12.459
- God, this is our lives!
- Glenn: Lower your voice.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.464
Andrea: We can't just sweep
this under the rug.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.626
Shane:
It ain't right. Not remotely.

02:18.139 --> 02:19.629
We've either
got to go in there,

02:19.807 --> 02:22.048
we've got to make things right
or we've just got to go.

02:22.226 --> 02:24.091
Now we have been talking about
Fort Benning for a long time.

02:24.270 --> 02:25.680
- We can't go.
- Why, Rick? Why?

02:25.855 --> 02:27.720
Because my daughter
is still out there.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.763
Okay.

02:31.319 --> 02:33.150
Okay, I think it's time
that we all start to just

02:33.321 --> 02:35.152
consider the other possibility.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.654
Shane, we're not leaving
Sophia behind.

02:36.824 --> 02:37.984
I'm close
to finding this girl.

02:38.159 --> 02:39.774
| just found her damn
doll two days ago.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.489
You found her doll, Daryl.
That's what you did. You found a doll.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.324
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.159
I'm just saying
what needs to be said.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.870
You get a good lead,
it's in the first 48 hours.

02:48.044 --> 02:49.284
Shane, stop.

02:49.462 --> 02:51.669
Let me tell you something else, man.
If she was alive out there

02:51.839 --> 02:54.251
and saw you coming
all methed out with your buck knife

02:54.425 --> 02:57.588
and geek ears around your neck,
she would run in the other direction.

02:57.762 --> 02:59.548
- Shut your mouth!
- Wait!

02:59.722 --> 03:00.711
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

03:00.890 --> 03:02.846
What are you doing?
Don't come at me, man!

03:03.017 --> 03:05.053
- Calm down!
- Shane!

03:05.227 --> 03:08.094
- Back off!
- Keep your hands off me.

03:08.272 --> 03:11.309
Nowjust let me talk to Hershel.
Let me figure it out.

03:11.484 --> 03:13.020
- What are you gonna figure out?!
-Enough!

03:13.194 --> 03:14.809
If we're gonna stay,
if we're gonna clear this barn,

03:14.987 --> 03:17.364
l have to talk him into it.
This is his land.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.147
Hershel sees those things
in there as people--

03:20.326 --> 03:22.738
sick people--

03:22.912 --> 03:25.904
his wife, his stepson.

03:26.082 --> 03:28.038
- You knew?
- Yesterday I talked to Hershel.

03:28.209 --> 03:29.619
And you waited the night?

03:29.794 --> 03:31.534
I thought we could survive
one more night.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.043
We did.

03:33.214 --> 03:35.796
l was waiting till this
morning to say something.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.093
- But Glenn wanted to be the one.
- The man is crazy, Rick,

03:38.260 --> 03:39.761
if Hershel thinks those
things are alive or no.

03:39.929 --> 03:43.717
- ( chains rattling )
- ( walkers growling )

03:48.687 --> 03:51.303
(theme music playing )

05:02.261 --> 05:04.502
(walkers growling )

05:16.567 --> 05:18.558
Glenn: Maggie.

05:18.736 --> 05:21.853
Hey, Maggie,
just talk to me.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.827
Hey.

05:30.998 --> 05:32.704
Maggie.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.666
Give me your hat.

05:36.837 --> 05:39.624
You said talk to you,
I'm talking to you. Give me your hat.

05:49.099 --> 05:51.681
Why would you waste
an egg like that?

05:51.852 --> 05:54.013
I think it was rotten.

06:09.245 --> 06:10.826
Does Shane think
Sophia's dead?

06:14.959 --> 06:17.245
Shane's just scared.

06:17.419 --> 06:20.126
- Of the walkers in the barn?
- Yeah.

06:24.802 --> 06:26.713
Mom,

06:26.887 --> 06:29.799
I'm not leaving
until we find Sophia.

06:31.058 --> 06:34.676
And I don't want to go
even after that.

06:37.106 --> 06:39.142
Well, we're not
leaving, Carl.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.349
Now finish those problems.

06:45.072 --> 06:48.439
ljust think she--

06:48.617 --> 06:50.903
she's gonna like it here.

06:51.078 --> 06:54.241
This place,
it could be a home.

07:19.815 --> 07:21.931
(grunts)

07:22.109 --> 07:24.976
- You can't.
- I'm fine.

07:25.154 --> 07:27.315
Hershel said
you need to heal.

07:27.489 --> 07:29.821
Yeah, I don't care.

07:29.992 --> 07:32.028
Well, I do.

07:32.202 --> 07:35.615
Rick's going out later
to follow the trail.

07:35.789 --> 07:38.952
Yeah, well, I ain't gonna
sit around and do nothing.

07:39.126 --> 07:42.289
No, you're gonna go out there
and get yourself hurt even worse.

07:45.716 --> 07:47.923
We don't know if we're
gonna find her, Daryl.

07:49.136 --> 07:51.127
We don't.

07:56.268 --> 07:58.224
I don't.

08:03.442 --> 08:04.898
What?

08:06.654 --> 08:09.111
Can't lose you, too.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.503
( groans )

08:23.671 --> 08:26.162
- Are you all right?
- Just leave me be.

08:28.300 --> 08:30.131
Stupid bitch.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.184
Andrea's looking for you.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.516
Thank you, Glenn.

08:43.691 --> 08:45.727
Any chance you got
an extra hat?

08:47.069 --> 08:48.900
Nope.

08:51.448 --> 08:53.154
Thanks.

08:54.827 --> 08:56.692
(gun cocks)

08:56.870 --> 08:59.156
Going off with Rick
to look for Sophia.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.200
I thought he was
talking with Hershel.

09:04.378 --> 09:05.709
He is.
We're gonna go after.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.380
I'm headed to the barn
in the meantime.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.664
Shane wants a watch duty
down there.

09:09.842 --> 09:11.207
Does Rick?

09:11.385 --> 09:13.546
Why wouldn't he?

09:15.806 --> 09:17.342
Are you only
getting yours?

09:20.602 --> 09:22.888
I don't know what's going
on with you and him.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.724
- Him?
- Shane.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.059
- Dale.
- It's not my business.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.816
All that matters to me
is that you--

09:29.987 --> 09:32.444
you may not
really know him.

09:34.032 --> 09:36.364
We don't need
to do this.

09:36.535 --> 09:38.491
- You and l are finally--
- It's important.

09:38.662 --> 09:40.163
| get it.
You don't like him.

09:40.330 --> 09:43.037
- It isn't that.
- Then what is it?

09:46.378 --> 09:48.243
Is that how you want to be?

09:48.422 --> 09:49.912
Like him?

09:52.968 --> 09:54.924
He's not a victim.

09:58.390 --> 10:00.426
You don't know him.

10:03.437 --> 10:06.725
Dale, I need you to stop.

10:06.899 --> 10:09.265
You spend so much time

10:09.443 --> 10:10.774
watching me,
looking out for me.

10:10.944 --> 10:14.436
You want to beat me up
anytime I show any concern.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.947
Go ahead.
I'm done.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.234
I'm not beating
you up, Dale.

10:20.412 --> 10:22.949
I'm okay, really.
Things are...

10:24.374 --> 10:26.535
different.

10:29.505 --> 10:31.496
You got your gun.

10:34.676 --> 10:35.882
Okay.

10:46.688 --> 10:48.974
- You okay?
- Dale: Yeah.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.977
You mind running
and getting me some water?

10:55.155 --> 10:57.396
| just--

10:57.574 --> 10:59.314
I need a second.

10:59.493 --> 11:02.360
You'll keep watch?

11:06.166 --> 11:07.781
Dale?

11:07.960 --> 11:10.667
Yeah, sure.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.187
( knocks )

11:31.358 --> 11:33.314
Come on in.

11:48.750 --> 11:51.583
A little light reading
for lunch?

11:54.256 --> 11:56.542
| get my studying
where I can.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.880
You know we can help
you out with your work.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.305
It's my field to tend.

12:07.519 --> 12:09.384
We found the barn.

12:10.898 --> 12:12.604
Leave it be.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.560
Well, I'd like
to talk about it,

12:14.735 --> 12:17.568
but either way-- your barn,
your farm, your say.

12:17.738 --> 12:20.605
I don't want to talk about the barn.
I don't want to debate.

12:20.782 --> 12:22.693
Not a debate,
a discussion.

12:33.253 --> 12:37.212
I need you and your group
gone by the end of the week.

12:42.137 --> 12:44.173
I talked to Dale.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.510
You and l have
our differences

12:47.684 --> 12:49.470
with the way we look
at the walkers.

12:49.645 --> 12:53.263
Those people,

12:54.942 --> 12:56.603
they may be dead,
they may be alive.

12:56.777 --> 12:58.563
But my people, us,

12:58.737 --> 13:00.944
we are alive right now,

13:01.114 --> 13:03.070
right here,
right in front of you.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.618
You send us out there
and that could change.

13:05.786 --> 13:07.651
I've given you safe harbor.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.616
My conscience is clear.

13:13.418 --> 13:15.329
This farm--

13:15.504 --> 13:17.665
this farm is special.

13:17.839 --> 13:21.582
You've been shielded from what's
been going on out there.

13:21.760 --> 13:24.126
Dale said you saw everything
happen on the news.

13:24.304 --> 13:27.046
Well, it's been--
it's been a long time

13:27.224 --> 13:30.091
since the cameras
stopped rolling.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.347
The first time
I saw a walker

13:33.522 --> 13:35.888
it was just half a body
snapping at me from the ground.

13:36.066 --> 13:38.148
My inclination
wasn't to kill it.

13:38.318 --> 13:41.606
But what the world is
out there isn't what you saw on TV.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.943
It is much much worse
and it changes you.

13:45.117 --> 13:47.324
Either into one of them

13:50.038 --> 13:53.656
Please do not--
do not send us out there again.

14:05.220 --> 14:07.836
My wife's pregnant.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.467
That's either a gift here

14:13.645 --> 14:15.510
or a death sentence
out there.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.974
If we were to stay
we could help you

14:21.153 --> 14:23.109
with the work,
with securing this place.

14:23.280 --> 14:24.611
We can survive together.

14:24.781 --> 14:27.193
Rick, I'm telling you we can't.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.608
- You think about what you're doing.
- I've thought about it.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.196
- Think about it.
- I've thought about it.

14:31.371 --> 14:33.862
Think about it again.
We can't go out there.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.380
( door closes)

15:23.131 --> 15:24.871
What's it gonna be, man?

15:25.050 --> 15:27.166
Which way does
this thing go?

15:27.344 --> 15:29.630
I don't know yet.

15:29.805 --> 15:31.591
Well, what did he say?

15:31.765 --> 15:34.598
- We're negotiating.
- You're nego--

15:35.977 --> 15:37.387
Clock's ticking, Rick.

15:37.562 --> 15:39.223
No, it isn't, Shane.

15:39.397 --> 15:40.978
That barn--
the barn is secure.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.980
We didn't even know
about it till this morning.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.107
We didn't.
Well, we know about it now.

15:45.278 --> 15:48.145
Right? We know there's over
a dozen walkers in there.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.780
We know that it's about
a stone's throw

15:50.951 --> 15:52.942
from our camp, Rick--
where we sleep.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.578
So look, if we're not gonna go in there
and clear it out then we just got to go.

15:56.748 --> 15:58.613
We're not gonna clear it
out and we're not gonna go.

15:58.792 --> 15:59.952
We at least
need our guns.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.709
We can't have them,
not here.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.040
Why do you want to stay here
when it's not safe?

16:05.215 --> 16:07.297
We can make it safe.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.253
- How we gonna do that?
- We will, okay?

16:09.427 --> 16:10.803
- How we gonna make it safe?
- We will, okay?

16:10.971 --> 16:13.383
- No, man, it's not okay.
- Shane, Lori's pregnant.

16:19.729 --> 16:22.471
We need to stay.

16:23.733 --> 16:25.314
We need our guns.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.646
No, I can work this out.

16:32.075 --> 16:34.441
- You good?
- Yeah.

16:35.912 --> 16:38.198
Lori's having a baby, man.

16:38.373 --> 16:41.285
Congratulations.

16:44.379 --> 16:45.994
Thank you.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.731
Hi, honey.

17:19.789 --> 17:22.280
Carl doesn't need
any more of my help.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.996
So that's it?

17:27.380 --> 17:29.371
Rick was trying
to make his case.

17:30.759 --> 17:33.125
It'll be hard.
They'll have to be careful.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.009
But he was being dramatic.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.013
They're a strong group.
They've done well on their own.

17:38.183 --> 17:41.050
They're just gonna have to go
out and find their own farm.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.810
There's plenty of them
now to chose from.

17:43.980 --> 17:46.517
There aren't.
Every one of them nearby

17:46.691 --> 17:48.898
is burned out
or full of walkers.

17:49.069 --> 17:51.276
Walkers?

17:53.740 --> 17:56.652
So we just keep these
people here forever?

17:58.370 --> 18:00.782
How are they
my responsibility?

18:02.582 --> 18:04.743
"A new command I give to you:

18:06.086 --> 18:08.748
love one another
as l have loved you."

18:10.924 --> 18:12.414
That's what you
told me, right?

18:16.763 --> 18:19.880
l was mad about Mom.

18:20.058 --> 18:22.765
Mad about you
marrying Annette.

18:24.020 --> 18:26.056
l was 14 years old
and l was awful,

18:26.231 --> 18:27.767
to you more
than anybody.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.641
All I wanted to do
was smoke and shoplift.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.275
"Love one another."
That's what you told me.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.565
Maggie.

18:40.704 --> 18:42.285
That was different.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.195
No.

18:44.374 --> 18:46.114
You're different.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.409
lam.

18:49.838 --> 18:51.453
But we're not.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.498
I love you.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.917
That's part of this.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.258
Is this about you
and the Asian boy?

19:01.433 --> 19:03.515
- Do you want me to--
- No.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.927
(sighs)

19:07.105 --> 19:09.517
His name is Glenn.

19:09.691 --> 19:12.103
He saved my life yesterday
when one of the people

19:12.277 --> 19:13.983
you think is sick
tried to kill me.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.896
How's that for dramatic?

19:20.076 --> 19:21.737
Things aren't what
you think they are.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.697
They aren't.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.658
Don't do this.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.373
Okay? It's not about
me and Glenn.

19:29.544 --> 19:31.455
It's not about
me and you.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.494
It's about you.

19:33.673 --> 19:36.631
It's about who you are,
who you're gonna be.

19:37.844 --> 19:39.835
Jimmy:
Hershel!

19:42.682 --> 19:44.013
It happened again.

19:47.896 --> 19:50.308
Rick: ...also shows she could
be moving this way south.

19:50.482 --> 19:52.222
lf Sophia kept
in that direction,

19:52.400 --> 19:55.107
she might have gotten out
of the forest and into the farmland.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.143
So we take 74
up to lvy Road,

19:57.322 --> 20:00.735
then push down south on foot through
the forest till we hit Christopher,

20:00.909 --> 20:03.992
go east a couple of miles
and then double back.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.823
- Rick.
- Hershel.

20:05.997 --> 20:08.989
We just have our guns out because
we're gonna go look for Sophia.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.954
Before you do that, I could use
your help with something.

20:12.128 --> 20:13.334
Count me in.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.962
Thank you,
but ljust need Rick.

20:19.469 --> 20:22.006
I'll be down at the barn
keeping watch until you're ready.

20:57.257 --> 21:00.465
- I thought he was dead.
- Shane, I don't--

21:00.635 --> 21:03.251
Then when he came back,
right then, right there,

21:03.430 --> 21:05.216
you see I wished he was.

21:05.390 --> 21:08.803
Not-- not because you
wouldn't be mine,

21:08.977 --> 21:11.764
but because I knew that sooner
or later he would be dead.

21:17.026 --> 21:18.857
See Rick,

21:19.028 --> 21:21.565
he ain't built
for this world,

21:21.739 --> 21:23.604
not for what it is now.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.399
You're wrong.
You're wrong.

21:26.578 --> 21:28.569
Lori, how many times
has he saved your life?

21:28.746 --> 21:32.034
I want to know how many times.
Because by my count,

21:32.208 --> 21:35.166
I've saved your life on four different
occasions. And that's Carl's, too.

21:35.336 --> 21:37.201
So ljust want to ask you, how many
times has Rick saved your life?

21:37.380 --> 21:39.792
That night at the camp. That night
at the camp after the fish fry.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.957
No,no,no.
See,no.

21:42.135 --> 21:44.217
That was me, too.

21:44.387 --> 21:47.754
You see, Rick,
he showed up late

21:47.932 --> 21:50.799
because he went on
a suicide mission over nothing.

21:50.977 --> 21:54.140
Yeah, hejoined in,

21:54.314 --> 21:56.270
but, see, we wouldn't
have been in that situation

21:56.441 --> 21:58.306
if he hadn't left
because he felt

21:58.485 --> 22:00.476
that he needed to leave
to save a drug dealer.

22:00.653 --> 22:03.861
And so we lost Amy
and we lost Jim.

22:04.032 --> 22:06.023
We lost--

22:12.790 --> 22:15.202
Rick told me.

22:15.376 --> 22:17.082
Told you what?

22:17.253 --> 22:19.244
And I know the reason
why you didn't

22:19.422 --> 22:21.083
is because
you know it's mine.

22:21.257 --> 22:23.543
- It's Rick's.
- Okay.

22:23.718 --> 22:25.424
You know, we carried on
quite a bit

22:25.595 --> 22:28.678
before Rick got back, Lori.
It's mine. You know it is.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.884
You're wrong.
You're wrong.

22:31.059 --> 22:34.176
I'm sorry.
Shane, I'm sorry.

22:34.354 --> 22:36.561
But even if it's yours,
it's not gonna be yours.

22:36.731 --> 22:40.440
It's never gonna be yours and there's
nothing you can do to change that.

22:47.242 --> 22:49.198
I don't need to.

23:10.640 --> 23:13.097
Hey, Shane.

23:13.268 --> 23:15.179
Can I talk to you
for a second?

23:21.484 --> 23:23.395
You okay?

23:23.570 --> 23:25.276
Yeah.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.186
I know you think
that Sophia's dead

23:27.365 --> 23:29.526
and that we should stop
looking for her.

23:29.701 --> 23:32.534
- But that's bullshit.
- Hey, man, watch your mouth.

23:32.704 --> 23:35.411
We're gonna stay here
until we find her.

23:37.959 --> 23:39.574
You think that's
what we should do?

23:39.752 --> 23:41.788
It's what I know
we should do.

23:44.215 --> 23:46.080
Then we stay.

23:47.218 --> 23:49.129
That means we got to do

23:49.304 --> 23:51.761
whatever we got to do
to make that happen.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.263
-Hmm?
- Like help out with chores?

23:54.434 --> 23:56.140
Mmm.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.224
Like help out
with the chores.

24:04.402 --> 24:06.438
Lori:
Carl.

24:06.613 --> 24:07.944
Come here for a minute.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.981
Why don't you go
see what your mom wants?

24:11.159 --> 24:14.322
Hmm?
Goon

24:16.289 --> 24:18.655
Hey, Carl.

24:18.833 --> 24:21.245
Don't let me hear
you talk like that again.

24:32.764 --> 24:35.221
Glenn:
S'up?

24:59.624 --> 25:01.489
Son of a bitch.

25:06.506 --> 25:08.918
You see where he went?

25:09.092 --> 25:11.834
- Who?
- Don't even try to shit me, okay?

25:12.011 --> 25:13.512
- What?
- Dale, Glenn.

25:13.680 --> 25:15.420
Did you see
where Dale went?

25:15.598 --> 25:17.930
Yeah, he asked me to run
and get him some water.

25:18.101 --> 25:19.511
He said he'd cover
me on watch.

25:19.686 --> 25:21.642
And he was gone
when you got back, huh?

25:21.813 --> 25:23.428
Yeah.

25:23.606 --> 25:25.642
- You think he's okay?
- Oh, he's fine.

25:25.817 --> 25:27.227
Why'd he bail then?

25:27.402 --> 25:29.313
So you wouldn't tell me
which way he went.

25:29.487 --> 25:31.523
I don't get it.

25:31.698 --> 25:34.030
No, man, you don't.

25:39.372 --> 25:42.580
The silt on the bottom
is like glue.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.251
You just sink in.

25:44.419 --> 25:45.875
(walkers growling )

25:46.045 --> 25:47.910
That's Lou Bush.

25:48.089 --> 25:49.499
You knew him?

25:49.674 --> 25:51.255
Lou as in Louise.

25:51.426 --> 25:53.712
She has a farm
up the road.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.751
Sweet corn mostly.

25:55.930 --> 25:58.171
Worked at Hatlin's Bar
on weekends.

25:58.349 --> 26:01.591
The man, I don't know him,

26:01.769 --> 26:03.384
but the coveralls,

26:03.563 --> 26:05.724
I've been
to where he worked.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.934
How many
have you killed?

26:08.109 --> 26:10.395
Too many to count.

26:12.530 --> 26:14.737
Can you stop?

26:20.204 --> 26:21.705
There are people out there

26:21.873 --> 26:24.410
who haven't been
in their right minds,

26:24.584 --> 26:26.950
people who I believe
can be restored.

26:27.128 --> 26:30.086
You're not talking
about the walkers, are you?

26:30.256 --> 26:33.544
It doesn't matter if you see them
as human beings anymore.

26:33.718 --> 26:36.380
But if you and your people
are going to stay here,

26:36.554 --> 26:39.091
that's how you're gonna
have to treat them.

26:39.265 --> 26:42.473
My farm, my barn, my say.

26:52.195 --> 26:54.481
- Daryl: You see it?
- Carol: See what?

27:02.997 --> 27:05.283
I'll find her.

27:13.466 --> 27:17.254
Hell, I'm sorry about
what happened this morning.

27:17.428 --> 27:20.215
You wanted
to look for her.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.970
Why?

27:25.144 --> 27:28.136
This whole time
I've just wanted to ask you.

27:29.607 --> 27:32.644
'Cause I think
she's still out there.

27:37.281 --> 27:41.820
Truth is,
what else I got to do?

28:00.471 --> 28:02.132
We'll find her.

28:02.306 --> 28:04.342
We will.

28:04.517 --> 28:06.849
| see it.

28:14.735 --> 28:18.273
Otis said if you get them halfway
out they'll do the rest of the work.

28:18.447 --> 28:20.187
How many times
did he do this?

28:20.366 --> 28:23.858
If one wandered onto the property,
Otis would get them into the barn.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.617
Now we have to.

28:25.788 --> 28:27.494
What happens when
the barn gets full?

28:27.665 --> 28:30.077
-Jeez!
- Get the pole!

28:30.251 --> 28:32.788
Jimmy. Jimmy.
You got it.

28:32.962 --> 28:35.203
Easy. Easy, Rick.
Lead him.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.712
Jimmy will spot for us.

28:36.883 --> 28:39.124
Lead him
lead him, Rick.

28:39.302 --> 28:41.634
- You're the carrot, not the stick.
- What?

28:41.804 --> 28:43.669
You heard me,
just lead him.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.679
He'll come to you.

28:45.850 --> 28:48.057
You told me
he handled them easily.

28:48.227 --> 28:50.559
This is easy?

28:50.730 --> 28:52.721
It's easier
than some things.

28:52.899 --> 28:55.140
Jimmy:
All right, it's through this way.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.030
Maggie.

29:13.586 --> 29:15.668
Hey.

29:21.260 --> 29:22.716
Maggie.

29:23.721 --> 29:25.086
Maggie.

29:25.264 --> 29:27.004
Maggie, just stop
for a second.

29:27.183 --> 29:29.925
You talked about it.
You told Dale, fine.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.935
| asked you.
I told you.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.811
ljust asked you
for one thing. One thing.

29:34.982 --> 29:36.142
I couldn't do it.

29:36.317 --> 29:38.273
My dad's gonna kick you guys
out now. He told me.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.230
No, Rick's gonna work
something out with your dad.

29:40.404 --> 29:42.656
- Okay? I had to tell them.
- You did not.

29:42.823 --> 29:45.360
No, I did.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.195
I wanted to.

29:49.872 --> 29:51.954
You see, I forgot.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.035
Okay? I forgot or I stopped
thinking about it

29:54.210 --> 29:56.246
or maybe I didn't want
to think about it.

29:56.420 --> 29:59.082
I let them lower me into
that well like it was fun,

29:59.256 --> 30:01.042
like I was playing "Portal."

30:01.217 --> 30:03.333
- It's a video game.
- Of course it's a video game.

30:03.511 --> 30:06.423
And then the pharmacy happened
yesterday and I realized something.

30:06.597 --> 30:08.553
| forgot that
they're dangerous.

30:08.724 --> 30:10.680
I don't care if they're sick
people or dead people,

30:10.851 --> 30:12.261
they're dangerous.

30:12.436 --> 30:14.222
And then I realized
something else.

30:14.397 --> 30:17.139
That I don't want you
in danger ever.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.932
So I hate to blow
your dad's big secret,

30:20.111 --> 30:23.228
but I'm sick of secrets.
Secrets get you killed.

30:23.406 --> 30:25.863
And I'd rather have you
pissed off at me and alive

30:26.033 --> 30:27.569
than liking me and dead.

30:27.743 --> 30:29.483
So that's why I told them.

30:32.707 --> 30:34.698
Hey, walker bait.

30:34.875 --> 30:36.911
Don't call me that.

30:39.922 --> 30:42.129
Okay, Glenn.

30:43.300 --> 30:45.461
( laughs)

31:15.458 --> 31:17.744
Shane:
Man, this is a good hiding place.

31:17.918 --> 31:20.625
We ain't been in
the swamps much, huh?

31:23.549 --> 31:26.382
Imagine if you applied
your tracking skills

31:26.552 --> 31:28.008
to finding Sophia.

31:28.179 --> 31:30.716
How about

31:30.890 --> 31:34.223
you just give me
that bag, huh?

31:34.393 --> 31:36.554
I'm not gonna do that.

31:36.729 --> 31:38.469
Yeah, you are, Dale.

31:38.647 --> 31:40.854
Unless, well,

31:41.025 --> 31:44.483
you do have that rifle
over your shoulder.

31:44.653 --> 31:46.564
You gonna shoot me
like you did Otis?

31:46.739 --> 31:48.149
Tell another story?

31:48.324 --> 31:50.781
( chuckles)
No, man.

31:52.203 --> 31:54.068
Hell, when you
really look at it

31:54.246 --> 31:56.282
in the cold light of day,

31:56.457 --> 31:59.699
you're pretty much
dead already.

32:02.296 --> 32:05.333
Just give me the guns.
Do it now.

32:05.508 --> 32:07.669
You think this
is gonna keep us safe?

32:07.843 --> 32:10.220
Mm-hmm.
I know it is.

32:10.387 --> 32:13.595
Rick is trying
to get Hershel--

32:13.766 --> 32:16.929
Dale, shut up. Just shut up
and give me the guns.

32:29.365 --> 32:31.731
Am I gonna
have to shoot you?

32:31.909 --> 32:34.400
Do I have to kill you?
Is that what it's gonna take?

32:35.788 --> 32:37.779
( chuckles )

32:37.957 --> 32:39.993
Eh.

32:51.554 --> 32:53.010
Yeah.

32:53.180 --> 32:55.671
That's what it's gonna take.

33:05.734 --> 33:07.349
This is where
you belong, Shane.

33:07.528 --> 33:08.859
How's that, Dale?

33:09.029 --> 33:11.987
This world,
what it is now,

33:12.158 --> 33:15.241
this is where
you belong.

33:17.580 --> 33:20.287
And I may not have what
it takes to last for long,

33:20.457 --> 33:22.197
but that's okay.

33:22.376 --> 33:25.209
'Cause at least I can say

33:25.379 --> 33:28.496
when the world goes to shit

33:28.674 --> 33:30.790
I didn't let it
take me down with it.

33:34.930 --> 33:36.670
Fair enough.

33:45.524 --> 33:48.186
You look like you should be in line
for the Early Bird Special.

33:49.570 --> 33:51.936
Go get your cap.
I'll wash it for you, okay?

33:54.158 --> 33:56.399
- Do you know what's going on?
- Where is everyone?

33:56.577 --> 33:58.659
- You haven't seen Rick?
- He went off with Hershel.

33:58.829 --> 34:00.444
We were supposed to leave
a couple hours ago.

34:00.623 --> 34:02.614
Daryl: Yeah, you were.
What the hell?

34:02.791 --> 34:05.043
Rick told us
he was going out.

34:05.211 --> 34:07.793
Damn it. Isn't anybody taking
this seriously?

34:07.963 --> 34:10.215
We got us a damn trail.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.498
Oh, here we go.

34:18.098 --> 34:20.089
- What's all this?
- You with me, man?

34:20.267 --> 34:22.883
- Yeah.
- Time to grow up.

34:23.062 --> 34:26.054
- You already got yours?
- Yeah. Where's Dale?

34:26.232 --> 34:28.018
- He's on his way.
- Thought we couldn't carry.

34:28.192 --> 34:29.557
We can and we have to.

34:29.735 --> 34:32.317
Look, it was one thing sitting
around here picking daisies

34:32.488 --> 34:34.149
when we thought this place
was supposed to be safe.

34:34.323 --> 34:35.654
But now we know it ain't.

34:35.824 --> 34:39.112
How about you, man?
You gonna protect yours?

34:41.080 --> 34:42.490
That's it.
Can you shoot?

34:42.665 --> 34:44.906
Can you stop? You do this,
you hand out these guns,

34:45.084 --> 34:46.494
my dad will make you
leave tonight.

34:46.669 --> 34:48.250
- We have to stay, Shane.
- What is this?

34:48.420 --> 34:49.830
We ain't going
anywhere, okay?

34:50.005 --> 34:52.792
Now look, Hershel,
he's just gotta understand.

34:52.967 --> 34:54.582
Okay? He--
well, he's gonna have to.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.422
Now we need to find Sophia.
Am I right?

34:57.596 --> 35:00.133
Huh? Now I want
you to take this.

35:00.307 --> 35:01.843
You take it, Carl, and you
keep your mother safe.

35:02.017 --> 35:03.097
You do whatever it takes.
You know how.

35:03.269 --> 35:04.384
Go on,
take the gun and do it.

35:04.561 --> 35:06.472
Rick said no guns.
This is not your call.

35:06.647 --> 35:08.137
This is not
your decision to make.

35:08.315 --> 35:11.728
Oh, shit.

35:11.902 --> 35:14.109
- This way. Come on.
- ( walkers growling )

35:16.782 --> 35:18.818
What is that?

35:18.993 --> 35:20.654
- What is that?
- Lori: Shane!

35:20.828 --> 35:22.989
(growling)

35:25.165 --> 35:26.826
Jimmy:
To me. Over this way.

35:30.170 --> 35:31.580
What the hell
are you doing?

35:31.755 --> 35:34.371
- Shane, just back off.
- Why do your people have guns?

35:34.550 --> 35:36.541
Are you kidding me?
You see?

35:36.719 --> 35:38.129
You see what
they're holding onto?

35:38.304 --> 35:40.670
- I see who I'm holding onto.
- No, man, you don't.

35:40.848 --> 35:42.429
Shane, just let us do this
and then we can talk.

35:42.599 --> 35:44.305
What you want
to talk about, Rick?

35:44.476 --> 35:47.513
These things ain't sick.
They're not people.

35:47.688 --> 35:50.145
They're dead. Ain't got to feel
nothing for them

35:50.316 --> 35:52.102
'cause all they do,
they kill!

35:52.276 --> 35:53.641
These things right here,

35:53.819 --> 35:55.480
they're the things
that killed Amy.

35:55.654 --> 35:58.066
They killed Otis.
They're gonna kill all of us.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.901
Shane, shut up!

36:00.075 --> 36:02.031
Hey, Hershel, man,
let me ask you something.

36:02.202 --> 36:03.612
Could a living
breathing person,

36:03.787 --> 36:05.243
could they walk away
from this?

36:05.414 --> 36:08.372
- ( gunshots)
- Rick: No!

36:08.542 --> 36:10.703
- Stop it!
- That's three rounds in the chest.

36:10.878 --> 36:12.709
Could someone who's alive,
could they just take that?!

36:12.880 --> 36:15.041
- Why is it still coming?
- ( gunshots)

36:15.215 --> 36:16.876
That's its heart,
its lungs.

36:17.051 --> 36:19.337
- Why is it still coming?
- ( gunshots)

36:19.511 --> 36:22.298
- Shane, enough.
- Yeah, you're right, man.

36:22.473 --> 36:24.009
That is enough.

36:24.183 --> 36:26.515
(gunshot)

36:40.199 --> 36:43.942
Enough risking our lives
for a little girl who's gone!

36:44.119 --> 36:45.950
Enough living next to a barn

36:46.121 --> 36:47.986
full of things that
are trying to kill us.

36:48.165 --> 36:51.874
Enough.
Rick, it ain't like it was before!

36:53.545 --> 36:56.036
Now if y'all want to live,
if you want to survive,

36:56.215 --> 36:57.705
you got to fight for it!

36:57.883 --> 37:01.125
I'm talking about
fighting right here, right now.

37:01.303 --> 37:04.010
Rick:
Take the snare pole.

37:04.181 --> 37:06.046
Hershel, take the snare pole.

37:06.225 --> 37:08.807
Hershel, listen to me,
man, please.

37:08.977 --> 37:11.104
Take it now.
Hershel!

37:11.271 --> 37:12.522
Take it!

37:12.689 --> 37:15.396
(shouting )

37:17.152 --> 37:20.485
No, Shane.
Do not do this, brother. Wait!

37:23.951 --> 37:25.566
- Don't do it!
- Rick!

37:25.744 --> 37:26.950
Please!

37:28.664 --> 37:31.872
Come on.

37:32.042 --> 37:34.124
This is not the way!

37:34.294 --> 37:36.376
Please!

37:36.547 --> 37:37.753
Get behind me.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.663
Come on.

37:39.842 --> 37:42.254
(growling)

38:04.491 --> 38:06.732
- Maggie.
- Okay.

38:22.718 --> 38:24.800
Stay back!

38:31.310 --> 38:33.175
Rick: Stop!

39:30.869 --> 39:33.246
(growling)

39:38.460 --> 39:40.917
(feet shuffling )

39:53.725 --> 39:55.886
( growls )

40:01.275 --> 40:03.106
(Carol sobbing )

40:03.277 --> 40:05.814
Oh, God.

40:05.988 --> 40:08.650
Sophia? Sophia!

40:08.824 --> 40:11.987
Oh, Sophia.

40:13.078 --> 40:14.989
Sophia.

40:33.056 --> 40:35.593
(Carol sobbing )

40:43.442 --> 40:45.808
(growling)

40:51.033 --> 40:52.864
Sophia.

41:04.129 --> 41:05.460
Don't watch.

41:21.688 --> 41:23.189
(gun cocks)

41:41.708 --> 41:43.448
(gunshot)

41:48.215 --> 41:51.753
(Carol wailing)

42:11.905 --> 42:14.487
(theme music playing )
