could consider this a marriage

actually "happen."

00:37.137 --> 00:39.973
Thank you for that.
Look, by working together
with your father

00:40.040 --> 00:42.976

I know. You were
just looking out for me.

Nick,
I have some troubling news.

01:25.118 --> 01:27.054
Ellen's brother
has reared his head again.

01:27.120 --> 01:30.924
He's not living up to
his end of our bargain.

01:30.991 --> 01:33.961
Uh, chase is looking for
improvements on his deal?

01:34.027 --> 01:35.963
No. Brian got a call
from the manager

01:36.029 --> 01:38.031
at Darling avionics.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.033
Apparently,
chase is spreading his theory

01:40.100 --> 01:43.036
about how his sister
met her death.
He's saying
that Patrick killed Ellen?

01:43.103 --> 01:46.006
Well, that
amongst other things.
That's alarming,

01:46.073 --> 01:50.010
since Patrick's inauguration
is less than 48 hours away.
Precisely.

01:50.077 --> 01:52.045
So I'm gonna need you
to go out to bethpage

01:52.112 --> 01:55.949
and have a chat with him,
put a lid on this.
Well, I'm pretty much booked,
Tripp.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.951
You asked me to finish
the partnership agreement

01:58.018 --> 02:00.053
between you and Simon
by the end of the day.

02:00.120 --> 02:02.022
Can't Brian go out there--
no. Brian, no.

02:02.089 --> 02:04.958
No, Andrea's in the hospital.

02:05.025 --> 02:08.027
He's got his son to
take care of. His plate's full.
Right.

02:08.095 --> 02:09.997
And really, it's best for me
if you do it.

02:10.062 --> 02:12.966
I mean, you're the only one
of us that chase trusts.

02:13.033 --> 02:14.968
I mean, you know that.
True.

02:15.035 --> 02:16.937
It's best this way.

02:22.042 --> 02:26.013

chief of staff.

02:26.079 --> 02:28.015
(Nola) I strongly disagree.

02:28.081 --> 02:29.950
Patrick should be sworn in

02:30.017 --> 02:31.952
on the floor of the senate
like everybody else.

02:32.019 --> 02:33.954
This will read as elitist.
Elitist?

02:34.021 --> 02:37.925
Really? To be sworn in
at federal hall is elitist?

02:37.991 --> 02:39.993
That's where George Washington
was inaugurated,

02:40.060 --> 02:41.061
for heaven sake.

If you have New York asses

02:59.046 --> 03:02.015
Well, I was just thinking
what all this would mean to me

03:02.082 --> 03:04.017
if things had gone differently.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.954
I am not gonna have another
conversation about Carmelita.

just here, it would--
well, she's not.
She won't be.

03:10.057 --> 03:12.960
It's over.
You need to move on.
You don't get it.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.029
She is the main reason
I ran for the senate.
And the fact that she scurried
upstate and stayed there

03:16.096 --> 03:17.998
is the reason you won.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.933
Grow a pair.

03:20.000 --> 03:23.003

10:55.088 --> 10:58.959
That you still
have feelings for me.
No. Not. Negatory.

10:59.026 --> 11:00.027
Come on. Admit it.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.062
You can't look me
in the eye.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.932
You can't even
be alone with me.
I can so.

11:04.998 --> 11:07.000
Not without losing your mind,

11:07.067 --> 11:09.002
'cause whenever
you're around me,

11:09.069 --> 11:11.972
all you can think about
is my hands underneath you,

11:12.039 --> 11:14.975
my lips on your neck...
That thing I used to do.

11:15.042 --> 11:17.978
Oh, that is such a low blow,
bringing up the thing.

11:18.045 --> 11:20.113
I'm a desperate man.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.951
Look,
you're always complaining

11:24.017 --> 11:25.052
that I'm still half boy.

11:25.118 --> 11:29.122
But you're the one who won't
work it out here, not me.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.995
God, can't you see
I'm crazy about you?

11:35.062 --> 11:38.065
You're such
a little bitch.

11:38.131 --> 11:42.936
(Sighs) Okay.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.038
I admit it.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.074
Admit what?

11:49.076 --> 11:51.011
I still have feelings
for you.

11:51.078 --> 11:52.946
There.
Doesn't that feel good?

11:53.013 --> 11:54.948
No, because it's never
gonna happen.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.950
Why?
It's complicated.

11:57.017 --> 11:58.952
Things with you
are always complicated.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.988
What is so incredibly--
Jeremy, just trust me.

12:01.054 --> 12:03.957
It's better for everyone
that we're through.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.026
(Carmelita) Hi.
I don't have an appointment,

12:06.093 --> 12:08.996
but it's very important
that I see the senator.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.931
Um...

12:10.998 --> 12:13.000
Hi. Can I help you?

12:13.066 --> 12:16.036
I'm here to see the senator.
I'm--

12:16.103 --> 12:19.006
I know exactly who you are.

12:19.072 --> 12:23.944
He's not gonna be back
for hours.

12:24.011 --> 12:26.013
Listen, if you know
what's good for you,

12:26.079 --> 12:29.049
you'll stay out of his life.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.953
Carmelita.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.989
(Sighs)
I need to see you...

12:36.056 --> 12:37.057
Alone.

12:37.124 --> 12:41.061
Of course.
Come right in.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.940
Oh, dear Brian.

12:53.006 --> 12:54.942
What a pleasant surprise.

12:55.008 --> 12:58.045
How are you? How is
your lovely bride doing?

12:58.111 --> 13:01.048
Well, she has about
ten white blood cells

13:01.114 --> 13:02.983
and can't eat solid food,

13:03.050 --> 13:05.986
but aside from that,
she's great.

13:06.053 --> 13:09.022
Oh, damn. You should
be with her, son.

13:09.089 --> 13:10.991
I'm fine.

13:11.058 --> 13:13.026
I can mind the store
without you.

13:13.093 --> 13:15.062
Well, obviously.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.064
I turn my back
for one minute,

13:17.130 --> 13:20.033
and Simon elder's
your new partner?

13:20.100 --> 13:21.935
(Laughs)

13:22.002 --> 13:23.971
What about me?

13:24.037 --> 13:25.939
This is a matter of--

13:26.006 --> 13:27.941
you told me
good things were ahead.

13:28.008 --> 13:29.009
And they are.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.944
Yeah?

13:31.011 --> 13:33.013
Because the last time
I checked,

13:33.080 --> 13:36.016
your half of the company
and Simon's half

13:36.083 --> 13:38.018
and little St. Nick
waiting in the wings

13:38.085 --> 13:39.987
leaves bupkes for me.

13:40.053 --> 13:43.957
Brian, this is not the time
for you to worry about business.

13:44.024 --> 13:45.993
Well, I think it is,
because if there's one thing

13:46.059 --> 13:48.962
that this whole thing with
Andrea has taught me about time,

13:49.029 --> 13:50.964
it's that there's
not enough of it.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.967
And this little trip
down the corporate ladder

13:54.034 --> 13:57.971
is not what I signed up for.
I quit.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.974
(Carmelita)
He seemed very dangerous.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.043
I hope I didn't do
the wrong thing coming here.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.012
No, it was exactly right.

14:05.078 --> 14:08.982
I mean, he kept going on
and on, completely irrational.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.984
And then he said he was
coming into the city.

14:11.051 --> 14:14.955
Carmelita,
you were right to come.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.957
We'll take care of it.

14:17.024 --> 14:18.025
Are you sure?

14:18.091 --> 14:19.993
Completely.

14:21.094 --> 14:23.931
Okay.

14:23.997 --> 14:25.999
I should go.

14:26.066 --> 14:29.036
Your chief of staff
wasn't too pleased to see me.

14:29.102 --> 14:32.973
I think that she's
just worried about...

14:33.040 --> 14:35.042
You know, perception.

14:35.108 --> 14:37.945
It's her job.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.981
Okay. I'm gonna go.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.050
No, no, no, no.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:43.116 --> 14:45.986
She's worried. I'm not.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.989
Now that I've seen you,
I'm not about to let you

14:49.056 --> 14:50.991
just turn around
and walk out of here.

14:51.058 --> 14:53.994
Let's have lunch
tomorrow...

14:54.061 --> 14:56.063
Somewhere we can talk.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.966
Please.

14:59.032 --> 15:00.934
(Chuckles)

15:01.001 --> 15:03.003
Just say you will.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.973
(Nola) Chase Alexander
is obviously delusional.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.975
I think there's only
one option.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.042
(Tripp) Which is?

15:09.109 --> 15:11.044
A 927.
A psychiatric hold?

15:11.111 --> 15:13.981
We just need a doctor
to sign off.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.983
Well, I mean,
we can arrange for that, yes?

15:16.049 --> 15:17.985
(Patrick) It seems like
the right thing.
Wait a second.

15:18.051 --> 15:20.053
Tripp, do you really want
to have this guy locked up?

15:20.120 --> 15:23.023
I mean, all he's done is say
he's planning on going public

15:23.090 --> 15:26.960
with a story
we all know is mostly true.
He's been ranting,
and--and this way,

15:27.027 --> 15:28.929
he will have
professional medical help.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.998
It's for his own good,
Nick.
Well, what happens
for his own good

15:31.064 --> 15:33.967
when the 72-hour
psychiatric hold is up?
Well, if he keeps
shooting his mouth off,

15:34.034 --> 15:36.036
we'll have him committed.
No.

15:36.103 --> 15:39.006
Well, we better
do something, Nick,

15:39.072 --> 15:41.975
because the way Carmelita
made it sound--
let me--let me talk to him.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.044
(Nola) You already did.
(Sighs) Well, give me
one last chance

15:44.111 --> 15:47.047
to give him
one last chance, please.
Wh-what does this guy
mean to you

15:47.114 --> 15:50.050
that you're so interested
in saving him, Nick?

15:50.117 --> 15:53.053
He's a human being.

15:53.120 --> 15:56.957
Just let me talk to him.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.025
Sure. Um, absolutely.

15:58.091 --> 16:01.028
Uh, just... sit down with him,
have a chat.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.964
But please make sure
that he understands

16:04.031 --> 16:05.966
that no good
can come from this.

16:06.033 --> 16:08.101
Thank you.

16:18.011 --> 16:19.012
Hey.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.014
This is getting to be
a habit.

16:21.081 --> 16:23.951
Well, I half expected you
not to show up.

16:24.017 --> 16:26.019
I almost didn't.

16:26.086 --> 16:29.022
And don't even think about
offering me more money,

16:29.089 --> 16:32.025
because I know
where that's gonna get me--

16:32.092 --> 16:33.961
nowhere.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.963
Okay.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.031
Listen, chase, I am
the first person to admit

16:38.098 --> 16:42.002
that having the Darlings
in your life can be...

16:42.069 --> 16:44.037
Destructive.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.940
They've made me
doubt myself.

16:47.007 --> 16:51.011
They've made me...
Wonder about my motives.

16:51.078 --> 16:53.013
But the bottom line here

16:53.080 --> 16:55.983
is that Patrick
didn't kill your sister.

16:56.049 --> 16:57.050
He didn't

16:57.117 --> 17:00.988
I wish I could believe that.

17:02.990 --> 17:03.991
All right.

17:04.057 --> 17:06.993
Well, just think about
how all this is gonna end.

17:07.060 --> 17:08.962
You go through with this,

17:09.029 --> 17:10.030
you--you seek
your revenge...

17:10.097 --> 17:11.999
You won't win.

17:12.065 --> 17:15.002
There--there--
there's nothing to be won.

17:15.068 --> 17:18.005
Nobody knows that
better than me.

17:18.070 --> 17:20.007
But you can
get your wife back

17:20.073 --> 17:22.041
and you can get
your kids back.

17:22.108 --> 17:24.044
Chase, I am sorry
about Ellen,

17:24.111 --> 17:27.981
but there is still a way
out of this for you.

17:28.048 --> 17:29.049
Yeah?

17:29.116 --> 17:31.084
Yeah.

17:40.127 --> 17:43.931
You know,
maybe you're right.

17:43.997 --> 17:46.033
I mean, look at me.

17:48.001 --> 17:49.937
Look at what I've become.

17:50.003 --> 17:51.004
(Siren wails, tires squeal)

17:51.071 --> 17:53.006
(Woman speaks indistinctly
over police radio)

17:53.073 --> 17:55.008
What the hell's going on?

17:55.075 --> 17:56.944
I don't know.

17:57.010 --> 17:59.046
You set me up?
That's him.

17:59.112 --> 18:02.950
No. No, I did not
set you up.
I trusted you,
and you set me up?

18:03.016 --> 18:04.952
Chase Alexander?
What? What's going on?

18:05.018 --> 18:07.020
You're gonna have to
come with us.

18:07.087 --> 18:09.990
We have a court order to hold
you for psychiatric detention.
Wait a minute.

18:10.057 --> 18:13.026
Officer, there has been
some kind of mistake here.
You sick bastard.
You lure me here,

18:13.093 --> 18:15.929
you tell me
everything's gonna be okay...
Chase--

18:15.996 --> 18:18.031
and then you have them
show up?
Officer, there has been
a mistake.

18:18.098 --> 18:21.034
You're worse than the Darlings.
Nice. A little more passion.
Uncuff him. I'm serious. Now!

18:21.101 --> 18:24.972
It's only for 72 hours,
Mr. George.
I trusted you.
I believed you.

18:25.038 --> 18:27.040
You are the worst one
of 'em all.

18:27.107 --> 18:31.011
You are worst
son of a bitch of 'em all!
(Man) Yeah, yeah. All right.

18:42.022 --> 18:45.058
What the hell
were you thinking?
(Laughs) What the hell
are you talking about?

18:45.125 --> 18:47.060
We agreed that I would
go talk to chase,

18:47.127 --> 18:49.963
I would protect him--
all of us--

18:50.030 --> 18:51.965
from this situation
escalating out of control,

18:52.032 --> 18:54.034
and you sent in the cops?!
Sent in the cops? Me?

18:54.101 --> 18:57.037
If anybody sent in the cops,
it would've been nola.
Oh, nola, my ass.

18:57.104 --> 19:00.040
There is nothing that goes on
in this family that you

19:00.107 --> 19:03.043
don't know about, control
or otherwise quietly endorse.

19:03.110 --> 19:05.946
God, Tripp, don't you see that
by going behind my back,

19:06.013 --> 19:07.948
by using force,
you forfeited

19:08.015 --> 19:10.984
the one real hold we had
on him, his trust in me?
I did not go behind your back.

19:11.051 --> 19:12.986
I would never betray you
like that, Nick.

19:13.053 --> 19:15.989
No, you would betray me
like this.
Nick, listen,
whatever's happened,

19:16.056 --> 19:19.059
I assure you, I had
nothing to do with it.

19:22.062 --> 19:23.997
(Elevator bell dings)

19:24.064 --> 19:27.968
Oh, my yearling.
How are you?

19:28.035 --> 19:30.971
Double Grande depresso, mom.

19:31.038 --> 19:32.039
Double Grande.

19:32.105 --> 19:34.007
(Sighs) Yes.

19:34.074 --> 19:36.977
Employment can be wilting.

19:37.044 --> 19:38.979
It's not the job,
it's the boss.

19:39.046 --> 19:41.014
Who, nola? Yeah.
She's a definite wilter.

19:41.081 --> 19:43.050
Mm. What happened?

19:43.116 --> 19:45.953
She finally fessed up.
She has feelings for me.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.956
Of course she does.
You're adorable.

19:49.022 --> 19:50.991
But she says
it's too complicated.

19:51.058 --> 19:53.026
Oh.

19:53.093 --> 19:54.928
What?

19:54.995 --> 19:56.930
Mm. She's seeing
someone else.

19:56.997 --> 19:58.966
You think?
It does seem likely.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.000
You want my advice?
What?

20:00.067 --> 20:01.935
Let her go. Love sucks.

20:02.002 --> 20:04.037
Hey, I was in love with Nick
for close to,

20:04.104 --> 20:06.974
what was it, forever,
and what did he do?

20:07.040 --> 20:10.944
He booby-trapped the one chance
at happiness I had left.

20:11.011 --> 20:12.012
You're wrong, dear.

20:12.079 --> 20:15.015
Thanks to Nick, you have
a chance at happiness.

20:15.082 --> 20:17.050
Simon elder
is the culprit here.

20:17.117 --> 20:20.053
(Sighs) Nick has always had
your best interests at heart.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.022
Take my advice.

20:22.089 --> 20:24.958
Put your... (Scoffs)
Resentments aside,

20:25.025 --> 20:27.027
and go see him, soon.

20:27.094 --> 20:28.996
As for you, dear,

20:29.062 --> 20:30.998
find out who nola is seeing

20:31.064 --> 20:33.000
and do whatever it takes
to remove him.

20:33.066 --> 20:35.969
You'll get
your little wilter back pronto.

20:36.036 --> 20:38.005
Mom.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.073
What?
This poor boy's in love.

20:44.011 --> 20:47.014
♪♪♪

20:51.018 --> 20:52.052
Hi.

20:52.119 --> 20:54.922
Hi.

20:54.988 --> 20:57.024
I never expected
to see this place again.

20:57.090 --> 20:59.960
They, uh,
always ask about you.

21:00.027 --> 21:02.963
Jorge made sure we got
our private room.

21:03.030 --> 21:05.065
P-please...
Come and sit down.

21:11.071 --> 21:14.041
Thanks a-again...
For the warning.

21:14.107 --> 21:16.043
Are you kidding?

21:16.109 --> 21:21.014
I could never
let anything happen to you.

21:23.016 --> 21:25.052
What's this?

21:25.118 --> 21:29.957
A pass
to my inauguration.

21:30.023 --> 21:31.992
I want you there.

21:32.059 --> 21:33.994
Paddy... you know
what they're gonna say--

21:34.061 --> 21:36.029
your father,
your chief of staff.

21:36.096 --> 21:38.966
I don't care.
I want you there.

21:39.032 --> 21:41.969
And after you're in
and that gets you past security

21:42.035 --> 21:44.004
and my father
and my chief of staff,

21:44.071 --> 21:47.040
I am going to pick you
out of the crowd by name

21:47.107 --> 21:49.977
and announce you
to the world.

21:50.043 --> 21:52.045
Patrick...

21:52.112 --> 21:55.048
Tomorrow's...
Not just going to be

21:55.115 --> 21:58.986
the start of my first term
of office.

21:59.052 --> 22:03.957
It's going to be the start
of a new life...

22:04.024 --> 22:06.059
For both of us.

22:19.072 --> 22:21.942
Brian.

22:22.009 --> 22:23.977
♪♪♪

22:24.044 --> 22:25.946
Bishop Bascombe.

22:26.013 --> 22:27.014
Your grace.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.017
Well, isn't this
a coincidence?

22:30.083 --> 22:32.953
Before I began
my hospital rounds today,

22:33.020 --> 22:35.989
I was praying, and suddenly,
the lord put you in my mind.

22:36.056 --> 22:38.992
It was as if you were standing
right there in front of me.

22:39.059 --> 22:40.994
Hmm. And now
here I am again...

22:41.061 --> 22:42.963
Walking away.

22:43.030 --> 22:46.934
Well, Brian, the six months
is up, isn't it?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.936
Your penitential retreat?

22:49.002 --> 22:51.939
Yeah. Time flies.

22:52.005 --> 22:53.106
And?

22:55.075 --> 22:58.045
Well, have you
thought about coming back?

22:58.111 --> 23:00.080
To the church?

23:02.015 --> 23:05.018
Not so much.

23:05.085 --> 23:08.922
Brian... it could be--

23:08.989 --> 23:10.924
it could very well be--

23:10.991 --> 23:13.961
that God
is calling you back.

23:14.027 --> 23:15.996
He's not.

23:16.063 --> 23:18.031
Trust me.

23:18.098 --> 23:20.934
How do you know?

23:21.001 --> 23:24.037
Because I never called him.

23:24.104 --> 23:27.941
But since you seem to have
a direct line,

23:28.008 --> 23:30.010
will you give him
a message for me?

23:30.077 --> 23:31.979
Anything.

23:32.045 --> 23:35.015
The fact that we're all
dragged here

23:35.082 --> 23:37.017
through time and space

23:37.084 --> 23:40.988
and then made to suffer
and die...

23:41.054 --> 23:43.090
Really sucks.

23:47.060 --> 23:49.029
(Cell phone rings)

23:49.096 --> 23:52.032
(Nola) Hello.

23:52.099 --> 23:54.968
Yeah. I'm on my way back
right now.

23:55.035 --> 23:57.971
Um, just have Jeremy leave
the permits on my desk.

23:58.038 --> 23:59.973
Um, what do you mean
he went home?

24:00.040 --> 24:01.975
W-well, can you
just call him and...

24:02.042 --> 24:03.977
Just forget it.
I-I--forget it.

24:04.044 --> 24:06.046
I'll deal with it
in the morning.

24:10.050 --> 24:12.019
(Sighs) Yeah. Bye.

24:12.085 --> 24:13.954
(Jeremy) Simon?

24:38.045 --> 24:40.080
Simon elder?

24:42.049 --> 24:43.984
Are those permits
on my desk?

24:44.051 --> 24:45.919
You're seeing Simon elder?

24:45.986 --> 24:46.987
What? No.

24:47.054 --> 24:48.989
Don't lie to me, nola.
I followed you.

24:49.056 --> 24:52.926
I watched you get into
his car.
You followed me?
My God, this is harassment.

24:52.993 --> 24:55.996
Are you in love with him?
You are, aren't you?
I don't owe you
an explanation.

24:56.063 --> 24:59.032
No, you don't, but you're gonna
owe my senatorial sibling one,

24:59.099 --> 25:02.002
right after I tell him about how
you're spending your evenings

25:02.069 --> 25:04.004
bouncing on
the corinthian leather

25:04.071 --> 25:07.007
with Simon elder in the backseat
of his German love machine.
Jeremy, listen--

25:07.074 --> 25:08.942
get away from me, trampolina!

25:09.009 --> 25:11.945
I mean, what do you like
about that guy, the jewelry?

25:12.012 --> 25:13.981
I can wear jewelry.
I'm not sleeping with Simon.

25:14.047 --> 25:16.984
You're not?
No.

25:17.050 --> 25:20.120
Then what is going on?

25:22.122 --> 25:24.024
Fine, I'll ask him.

25:24.091 --> 25:27.995
I meet with him
from time to time.

25:28.061 --> 25:30.964
Okay?

25:31.031 --> 25:33.066
He helped my father out once.

25:33.133 --> 25:35.969
Yeah?

25:36.036 --> 25:37.070
And?

25:40.007 --> 25:41.008
I can't.

25:41.074 --> 25:45.946
Fine.
It's your choice.

25:46.013 --> 25:49.049
He's got control of my brother.
He won't tell me where he is.
Brother?

25:49.116 --> 25:52.019
I can't tell you
anything else.

25:55.989 --> 25:57.925
Okay. I'm gonna get you
out of this.

25:57.991 --> 25:58.992
No.
Yeah.

25:59.059 --> 26:02.029
I'm gonna open up a can
of whoop-ass on this freak.

26:02.095 --> 26:03.997
Jeremy, no, you can't--
you can't do anything.

26:04.064 --> 26:05.999
If you do anything at all

26:06.066 --> 26:08.969
that makes it apparent
that you know about this,

26:09.036 --> 26:13.006
my brother could be
in serious danger.
Don't worry.
I'm gonna take care of it.

26:15.042 --> 26:18.045
(Bells tolling)

26:21.081 --> 26:23.016
This is you...

26:23.083 --> 26:25.986
Being you.

26:26.053 --> 26:29.923
I get that.

26:29.990 --> 26:31.959
This is what you do.

26:32.025 --> 26:34.061
You bring us into this world...

26:34.127 --> 26:38.966
You make it incredibly hard
to feel at home here,

26:39.032 --> 26:40.968
and then right
when we finally realize

26:41.034 --> 26:42.970
that this is
where we want to be,

26:43.036 --> 26:45.939
you force us out--

26:46.006 --> 26:51.078
all part of your wonderful,
unknowable plan.

26:55.082 --> 26:59.019
Look... she's dying.

26:59.086 --> 27:02.990
She thinks she's ready.

27:03.056 --> 27:06.026
But here's the thing...

27:06.093 --> 27:08.996
I'm not...

27:09.062 --> 27:11.999
And neither is our kid.

27:15.035 --> 27:18.071
You want me to pray?
I'll pray.

27:22.009 --> 27:24.077
Please don't take her.

27:29.016 --> 27:31.919
She's got a few more...

27:31.985 --> 27:33.921
Paper chains to make

27:33.987 --> 27:37.024
for a few more
Christmas trees...

27:37.090 --> 27:42.029
A few more birthday parties
to arrange...

27:44.998 --> 27:48.068
Cupcakes to ice
for a few more years.

27:55.042 --> 27:56.977
At least give us "K" through 12.

27:57.044 --> 27:59.112
I mean... (Mutters)

28:05.018 --> 28:07.988
It was just getting good.

28:11.058 --> 28:14.027
You want me back?

28:14.094 --> 28:19.032
Then you step up and show me
what you can do for me.

28:25.105 --> 28:28.008
And if you do,

28:28.075 --> 28:30.110
I'll do whatever you want.

28:32.112 --> 28:33.981
(Elevator bell dings)

28:34.047 --> 28:35.983
Nick, we need to talk.

28:36.049 --> 28:37.918
It sounds serious.

28:37.985 --> 28:39.920
It is.

28:39.987 --> 28:42.022
See, there comes a time
in every man's life

28:42.089 --> 28:44.992
when he needs to step up

28:45.058 --> 28:46.994
and take matters
into his own hands.

28:47.060 --> 28:49.963
That time for me
is right now.

28:50.030 --> 28:52.032
Okay. Shoot.
I need you to do something.

28:54.034 --> 28:55.969
Uh, well, what's that?

28:56.036 --> 28:58.005
Nola lyons.

28:58.071 --> 29:00.040
She's in trouble.

29:00.107 --> 29:02.109
(Simon) Trouble?

29:05.078 --> 29:07.981
Hey, Simon.
What kind of trouble?

29:08.048 --> 29:09.049
You know what?
It'll sit.

29:09.116 --> 29:11.985
Uh, w-wait, Jeremy. You didn't
even tell me what the--

29:12.052 --> 29:13.987
no. No, no, no.
It's--it's cool.

29:14.054 --> 29:16.023
You sure?

29:16.089 --> 29:18.058
It's supercool.

29:21.061 --> 29:24.097
I'll see y'all
around the quad.

29:27.067 --> 29:28.068
Nick.

29:28.135 --> 29:31.038
Simon.
What was that all about?

29:31.104 --> 29:33.941
I have no idea.

29:34.007 --> 29:35.042
(Chuckles)

29:35.108 --> 29:36.977
Well... (Clears throat)

29:37.044 --> 29:41.014
The signed partnership agreement
between me and Tripp.

29:41.081 --> 29:44.952
You are stuck with me.

29:45.018 --> 29:46.987
(Laughs)

29:47.054 --> 29:49.056
It's official.

29:52.092 --> 29:56.029
I've got chase Alexander here.
Bringing him over from county.

29:56.096 --> 29:58.031
Somebody needs to sign
for the transfer.

29:58.098 --> 30:03.070
I'll go get the doctor.
We weren't expecting you.

30:07.040 --> 30:10.043
Okay, sunshine.
Time to check out your room.

30:13.080 --> 30:15.949
Oh! (Grunts)

30:16.016 --> 30:18.986
(Gurgling)

30:19.052 --> 30:20.988
(Grunting)

30:21.054 --> 30:22.022
(Gasps)

30:22.089 --> 30:23.056
(Grunts)

30:44.044 --> 30:45.045
Ow.

30:45.112 --> 30:46.980
All right. That's good.

30:47.047 --> 30:49.049
Now I want you all
to take meticulous notes.

30:49.116 --> 30:52.019
This patient's value
as a research subject

30:52.085 --> 30:54.955
can't be overstated.
What's going on here?

30:55.022 --> 30:56.023
Brian.
Get away from her.

30:56.089 --> 30:59.026
Hey. Hey, what are you doing?
She's not a science experiment,
leeches!

30:59.092 --> 31:02.029
Mr. Darling, this is
a teaching--
and you're fired!

31:02.095 --> 31:05.032
Dr. feelgood.
Stop it, Brian. Stop it.

31:05.098 --> 31:08.035
As I was saying,
this is a teaching hospital.

31:08.101 --> 31:10.938
When a case takes
an unexpected turn,

31:11.004 --> 31:12.039
we invite the residents--

31:12.105 --> 31:14.007
wh-what unexpected turn?

31:14.074 --> 31:17.010
Andrea's white count is up,
marginally,

31:17.077 --> 31:20.013
and her ca-125's
undetectable.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.015
I don't understand.

31:22.082 --> 31:24.918
I'm getting better.

31:24.985 --> 31:27.054
We don't want
to get ahead of ourselves,

31:27.120 --> 31:30.991
but there definitely appears
to be some improvement.

31:31.058 --> 31:33.994
The drug
seems to be working,

31:34.061 --> 31:36.997
and for the first time
since we began treatment,

31:37.064 --> 31:40.000
there's reason to hope.
Hope, Brian.

31:59.019 --> 32:00.954
Nick?
(Knocks on door)

32:01.021 --> 32:02.089
Anyone home?

32:04.091 --> 32:06.960
Nick?

32:07.027 --> 32:09.029
(Door slams)

32:09.096 --> 32:11.999
Oh. Who are you?

32:12.065 --> 32:13.967
You don't remember?

32:14.034 --> 32:17.004
(Gasps) Oh, God.
Did we, um...

32:17.070 --> 32:19.039
(Laughs) You know?

32:19.106 --> 32:21.008
I'm Ellen's brother chase.

32:21.074 --> 32:23.944
Oh! Right. Ellen's brother.

32:24.011 --> 32:27.014
Oh. I'm so sorry about her.

32:29.016 --> 32:30.951
So what are you doing here?

32:31.018 --> 32:32.953
Um... I'm looking for Nick.

32:33.020 --> 32:34.988
You know, we had a tiff,
things were said.

32:35.055 --> 32:36.056
Oh, me, too.

32:36.123 --> 32:37.991
Oh.

32:38.058 --> 32:40.027
Huh.

32:43.063 --> 32:45.966
You know, I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go, but, um,

32:46.033 --> 32:47.968
could you--
when you see him,

32:48.035 --> 32:49.970
could you do me a favor
and let him know

32:50.037 --> 32:51.972
that I--have a gun--
you have a gun.

32:52.039 --> 32:54.007
You have a gun.
I--you know what? It's cool.

32:54.074 --> 32:56.009
I'm just gonna take a--(Gasps)

32:56.076 --> 32:58.946
You're not going anywhere.

32:59.012 --> 33:00.080
Okay.

33:02.049 --> 33:04.952
Mm-hmm.

33:05.018 --> 33:08.055
Okay. I'll call you back.

33:10.090 --> 33:11.992
You wanted to see me?

33:12.059 --> 33:13.994
Yeah, I wanted to, uh,
thank you

33:14.061 --> 33:16.997
for the senate file
you got for me.

33:17.064 --> 33:20.968
Once Patrick gets to D. C.,
it's gonna be very helpful.

33:21.034 --> 33:23.003
You're welcome.
Is that it?

33:23.070 --> 33:24.972
No.

33:25.038 --> 33:28.041
No, I wanted to...
Show you this.

33:28.108 --> 33:29.977
What is it?

33:30.043 --> 33:31.979
It's your brother's
report card.

33:32.045 --> 33:34.014
He's quite a capable learner.

33:34.081 --> 33:36.984
Although his teachers,
as you'll see,

33:37.050 --> 33:39.953
say he's having some issues
with self-control.

33:40.020 --> 33:42.990
When am I gonna be able
to t--

33:43.056 --> 33:45.959
talk to him again?
Yeah, I been thinking

33:46.026 --> 33:48.929
that it's, uh, about time
to set up a chat.

33:48.996 --> 33:50.931
But given your own problem
with self-control,

33:50.998 --> 33:53.033
I don't think you'd be
such a good influence.
I don't know
what you're talking--

33:53.100 --> 33:55.936
if you can't
keep your mouth shut

33:56.003 --> 33:57.938
about our little arrangement,

33:58.005 --> 34:00.007
if you think you're gonna
run to your boyfriend

34:00.073 --> 34:02.009
and get him to help save you,

34:02.075 --> 34:04.978
then clearly you don't know
how to restrain yourself.

34:05.045 --> 34:07.981
Clearly... you don't understand
what the stakes are.

34:08.047 --> 34:10.016
Am I wrong?

34:10.083 --> 34:12.953
No.

34:13.020 --> 34:15.088
Good.

34:18.058 --> 34:21.995
Thank you for the respect
of an honest answer.

34:22.062 --> 34:24.063
Hmm.

34:24.130 --> 34:29.036
He is a smart kid.
I know you're proud of him.

34:29.101 --> 34:31.071
I'm done.

34:40.047 --> 34:44.016
Money doesn't make you happy.
You know that, right?

34:44.083 --> 34:45.953
Oh, boy howdy.

34:46.018 --> 34:48.956
I had to lose my wife
and sell my soul to Nick George

34:49.022 --> 34:50.991
to learn that lesson.

34:51.058 --> 34:53.025
Ruined my life, taking money
from that jackass.

34:53.092 --> 34:54.962
Sorry?

34:55.027 --> 34:56.964
Yeah, you should be--
all you Darlings--

34:57.030 --> 35:00.067
for perpetuating the lie
that money fixes everything.

35:00.133 --> 35:03.003
You got all of us everywhere
chasing something

35:03.070 --> 35:06.006
that'll only make us miserable
in the end.

35:06.073 --> 35:08.976
And Nick...

35:09.042 --> 35:11.011
He's the worst.

35:11.078 --> 35:14.014
He ties it all up
in a pretty little bow

35:14.081 --> 35:16.049
and makes it seem like
Christmas morning.

35:16.116 --> 35:18.986
Well, he's not really
that b--

35:19.052 --> 35:21.088
bad.

35:23.991 --> 35:26.059
Ellen said you had
a thing for him.

35:28.028 --> 35:29.029
She hated you, you know?

35:29.096 --> 35:30.964
Well, that's disappointing.

35:31.031 --> 35:33.033
I always thought of her
as a friend.

35:33.100 --> 35:35.969
She would
make fun of you, too,

35:36.036 --> 35:37.004
your little crush on Nick.

35:37.070 --> 35:39.940
The guy is married with a kid,

35:40.007 --> 35:42.943
you keep trying
to jump him anyway.

35:43.010 --> 35:44.945
You're a real slut,
aren't you?

35:45.012 --> 35:48.015
(Cell phone rings)

35:48.081 --> 35:50.083
(Ring)

35:52.085 --> 35:54.988
(Phone beeps)
Hello?

35:55.055 --> 35:56.990
Where do you think
you're going?

35:57.057 --> 35:58.926
(Gasps) Nowhere.

35:58.992 --> 36:00.961
That's right.

36:09.102 --> 36:11.038
(Bells tolling)

36:11.104 --> 36:14.007
Okay. Okay.
You friggin' win.

36:14.074 --> 36:15.976
Brian.

36:16.043 --> 36:18.011
What brings you here?

36:18.078 --> 36:20.981
You can have me back...

36:21.048 --> 36:22.983
If you still want me.

36:23.050 --> 36:26.053
Well... it has little
to do with me, Brian,

36:26.119 --> 36:30.023
but... I'm sure
the lord is pleased.

36:30.090 --> 36:34.027
Well, that's what counts.

36:34.094 --> 36:35.963
(Chuckles)

36:36.029 --> 36:40.968
Might I ask you
what changed your mind?

36:41.034 --> 36:43.003
I-I had a...

36:43.070 --> 36:45.005
Revelation.

36:45.072 --> 36:47.007
Really?

36:47.074 --> 36:49.042
Of what nature?

36:49.109 --> 36:51.044
I realized my little foray

36:51.111 --> 36:54.014
into the world
of Darling enterprises

36:54.081 --> 36:56.049
wasn't getting me
what I wanted.

36:56.116 --> 36:58.051
So that's when I decided

36:58.118 --> 37:01.955
that I could get
what I'm looking for right here.

37:02.022 --> 37:03.957
What are you saying,
Brian?

37:04.024 --> 37:06.960
What I'm saying is simple,
bishop Bascombe.

37:07.027 --> 37:10.063
I want your job.

37:10.130 --> 37:12.032
(Laughs)

37:12.099 --> 37:14.101
(Chuckles)

37:16.136 --> 37:18.038
We're here live at federal hall,

37:18.105 --> 37:20.040
the first capitol
of the United States,

37:20.107 --> 37:23.010
the site of George Washington's
first inauguration,

37:23.076 --> 37:24.945
and today,

37:25.012 --> 37:27.047
senator-elect Patrick Darling's
swearing in ceremony.

37:27.114 --> 37:30.017
(Crowd cheering)
It is an unusual location

37:30.083 --> 37:32.019
for a freshman senator's
inauguration.

37:32.085 --> 37:34.054
Some would call it
downright presumptuous.

37:34.121 --> 37:36.056
But we've come to expect
nothing less

37:36.123 --> 37:38.058
from America's first family,
the Darlings.

37:38.125 --> 37:41.962
I will well and faithfully
discharge the duties

37:42.029 --> 37:44.965
of the office upon which
I am about to enter.

37:45.032 --> 37:46.033
Will well and faithfully...

37:46.099 --> 37:49.036
Well and faithfully.
Doesn't that sound funny?

37:49.102 --> 37:52.039
It sounds perfect.
Go on.

37:53.106 --> 37:56.043
The office upon which
I am about to enter,

37:56.109 --> 37:58.011
so help me God.

37:58.078 --> 38:00.948
So help me God.

38:01.014 --> 38:03.016
Look at you.

38:03.083 --> 38:05.052
All right,
here's the plan--

38:05.118 --> 38:07.054
I want you to wait outside,

38:07.120 --> 38:10.057
and when I'm coming down
the stairs to be sworn in,

38:10.123 --> 38:13.026
I want you to sneak in
behind me,

38:13.093 --> 38:16.029
and when I'm about to give
my speech--
are you sure
you want to do this?

38:16.096 --> 38:18.031
I have
never been more certain

38:18.098 --> 38:21.001
about anything
in my entire life.

38:21.068 --> 38:23.003
This is our moment.
Love you.

38:23.070 --> 38:25.973
(Whispers) I love you.

38:26.039 --> 38:27.941
Go, go.

38:28.008 --> 38:30.010
... perfect.
It establishes exactly what...

38:30.077 --> 38:32.045
(Mutters softly)

38:32.112 --> 38:34.014
Patrick.

38:34.081 --> 38:35.949
Dad.

38:36.016 --> 38:37.017
That was Carmelita.

38:37.084 --> 38:40.921
That's right, and I plan
to have her by my side

38:40.988 --> 38:42.923
for when I take
the oath of office.

38:42.990 --> 38:45.025
And you thought springing
this on us at the last minute--

38:45.092 --> 38:47.961
was the only way
to get it done, Nick.
Patrick--

38:48.028 --> 38:49.997
this is my inauguration,
gentlemen, my senate career,

38:50.063 --> 38:52.933
my life.
Which, for all intents
and purposes,

38:53.000 --> 38:55.936
we are more determined
to preserve than he is.

38:56.003 --> 38:58.005
(Cell phone rings)
What?

38:58.071 --> 38:59.940
(Ringing)

39:00.007 --> 39:01.041
Excuse me.

39:01.108 --> 39:02.943
Hello?

39:03.010 --> 39:04.945
(Karen) Nick...

39:05.012 --> 39:08.048
Hello, Lisa?
Are you in the house?

39:08.115 --> 39:10.017
Hello?

39:10.083 --> 39:12.019
He's...

39:12.085 --> 39:14.021
Who is this?
Are you okay?

39:14.087 --> 39:15.989
He's...

39:16.056 --> 39:17.925
Who is this?

39:17.991 --> 39:18.992
Nick...

39:19.059 --> 39:21.028
Karen, is that you?

39:21.094 --> 39:24.064
(Dial tone drones)
Tripp, where's Karen?

39:24.131 --> 39:28.035
I have no idea.
With Letitia, probably.

39:31.004 --> 39:32.973
(Nola) Jeremy!
Have you seen Nick?
I gotta find him.

39:33.040 --> 39:35.008
Listen, you didn't tell him
about Simon and me, did you?
No.

39:35.075 --> 39:37.044
Are you sure? Because--
but I'm gonna
as soon as I find him.

39:37.110 --> 39:39.980
No, no. You can't tell him.
You can't tell anyone.

39:40.047 --> 39:42.950
Listen, I'm sorry
that I got you involved--
no, you did the right thing.
I told you,

39:43.016 --> 39:46.019
I'm gonna take care of it.
Let me go take care of it.
No, Jeremy, listen to me!
Listen, this is...

39:46.086 --> 39:48.021
Ms. lyons, there you are.
Everything okay?
Um, yes, everything is fine.

39:48.088 --> 39:50.958
I'm actually just gonna
check in with the senator.

39:51.024 --> 39:52.993
Why don't you check on--
on that side...

39:53.060 --> 39:55.062
(Man) Will do.

39:59.066 --> 40:00.968
If I'd told you,
you would have undertaken

40:01.034 --> 40:03.937
all these machinations
to stop me,

40:04.004 --> 40:06.039
and I will not be stopped,
not this time.

40:06.106 --> 40:08.942
You're deranged, suicidal.
It's political suicide.

40:09.009 --> 40:10.010
Mr. Darling.

40:10.077 --> 40:12.946
This is your
greatest achievement, son.

40:13.013 --> 40:14.948
It is beyond my comprehension

40:15.015 --> 40:17.985
why you are so compelled
to sabotage--
Mr. Darling, sir, we--

40:18.051 --> 40:19.019
having Carmelita by my side

40:19.086 --> 40:21.021
after everything
you've done to us

40:21.088 --> 40:23.056
would be
my greatest achievement.
Mr. Darling.

40:23.123 --> 40:26.026
What?!
We've got a situation.

40:26.093 --> 40:27.995
Letitia.

40:28.061 --> 40:28.996
Nicky.

40:29.062 --> 40:30.998
Is Karen with you?

40:31.064 --> 40:33.000
No. When I saw her
this morning,

40:33.066 --> 40:35.035
she said she was headed
to see you.
Where did she go?
Did she go to my house?

40:35.102 --> 40:37.004
I tried to tell--yes, why?

40:37.070 --> 40:39.973
Nick.
We have a problem.

40:40.040 --> 40:41.975
Yeah, I think so, too.
What's going on?

40:42.042 --> 40:43.977
Oh, chase has escaped--
overcame his guard,

40:44.044 --> 40:47.014
knocked him out, stripped him
naked, stole his gun.
When, just now?

40:47.080 --> 40:50.017
No, a couple of hours ago.
Get a cop
to 224 bank street, now.

40:50.083 --> 40:51.952
(Man) Yes, sir.
What's happening, Nick?

40:52.019 --> 40:54.021
Uh, we've gotta call off
the inauguration.

40:54.087 --> 40:56.990
Get this area
evacuated immediately.
What's happened?
What can I do?

40:57.057 --> 40:59.026
No time to explain, Tripp.

40:59.092 --> 41:02.996
(Cheering)

41:03.063 --> 41:04.031
♪♪♪

41:04.097 --> 41:05.966
Hey.

41:06.033 --> 41:08.001
(Man) As the senator-elect
Patrick Darling

41:08.068 --> 41:10.938
makes his way onto the stage...

41:11.004 --> 41:13.974
(Man continues
speaking indistinctly)

41:14.041 --> 41:16.977
(Patrick) Thank you. Thank you.

41:17.044 --> 41:18.979
Too loud.

41:19.046 --> 41:22.950
(Cheering continues)

41:23.016 --> 41:24.952
Hey, Nick!
We gotta talk.
Not now, Jeremy.

41:25.018 --> 41:27.054
But, Nick!

41:27.120 --> 41:28.989
(Cheering continues)

41:29.056 --> 41:31.992
Chief! Chief, we gotta
shut this down.

41:32.059 --> 41:35.028
Why?
Security threat.
We gotta stop it, now.

41:35.095 --> 41:38.098
(Cheering)

41:41.034 --> 41:42.069
Gun! Everybody down!
Nick, don't!

41:42.135 --> 41:44.972
Jer, get out of the way!

41:45.038 --> 41:46.940
(Screaming)
(Grunts)

41:47.007 --> 41:49.943
Gun! Everybody down!
(Gunshot)

41:50.010 --> 41:53.046
(Screaming)

41:58.051 --> 42:01.054
(Screaming continues)

42:03.023 --> 42:03.957
(Gunshot)

42:04.024 --> 42:04.958
(Gunshot)

42:05.025 --> 42:07.706
(Gunshot)
