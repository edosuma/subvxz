00:09.540 --> 00:11.230
You've been set up by your own brother.

00:11.280 --> 00:14.270
Elizabeth, you're quite
something. Get me Athif Kamara.

00:14.320 --> 00:17.390
Superintendent Walker has
put me on cold cases.

00:17.440 --> 00:19.430
Cold cases?

00:19.480 --> 00:21.870
Laura Fraser was young and she was pretty.

00:21.920 --> 00:25.670
And she was murdered in her own
home by an intruder. That's a story.

00:25.720 --> 00:27.720
Ohh!

00:30.600 --> 00:33.070
I'm going to help DS Stevens.

00:33.120 --> 00:36.360
Someone killed that girl.
I'm going to find out who.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.950
Bancroft. You're giving the
address at Charlie's funeral?

02:03.000 --> 02:05.310
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, horrible accident.

02:05.360 --> 02:08.830
- Who found him, by the way?
- His wife, apparently.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.030
Terrible.

02:10.080 --> 02:14.750
- I heard he was on the way out anyway.
- Yes. Yes, I heard that, too.

02:14.800 --> 02:18.080
Well, give him a good send-off.
Half the force will be there.

02:19.480 --> 02:22.550
The Fraser case was a mess.
And as far as I can work out,

02:22.600 --> 02:25.510
- Haverstock was negligent.
- Hey, keep your voice down.

02:25.560 --> 02:27.190
The man's being buried today.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.550
He closed the case down too soon.
He was biased against the father.

02:30.600 --> 02:34.270
This is about statistics. I need convictions.
Where are you with the forensics?

02:34.320 --> 02:37.200
We're looking for them, but
they're not in our storage unit.

02:38.800 --> 02:40.590
[No forensics, no case.]

02:40.640 --> 02:43.520
- I'll find them.
- Mm.

02:50.240 --> 02:51.240
Come in.

02:52.040 --> 02:53.590
Hi, guv.

02:53.640 --> 02:54.950
This is Dr Karim.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.670
I was telling her that you were first
on the scene at the Fraser house

02:58.720 --> 03:00.790
and she had a couple of questions for you.

03:00.840 --> 03:04.310
Sorry to bother you, Ma'am, but
unfortunately we can't ask DI Haverstock.

03:04.360 --> 03:06.670
No, of course. I'll do
anything I can to help.

03:06.720 --> 03:09.350
And I'm thrilled that Katherine's
got you on this case.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.190
I've heard some very positive
things about your work.

03:12.240 --> 03:13.670
Thank you.

03:13.720 --> 03:16.630
So, erm, you found Laura Fraser?

03:16.680 --> 03:19.670
Yes. I er... I was in the
area, I picked up the call.

03:19.720 --> 03:22.200
How long did it take before SOCO arrived?

03:23.280 --> 03:24.830
An hour maybe.

03:24.880 --> 03:29.190
I think Haverstock arrived
first and then the husband.

03:29.240 --> 03:30.750
- Tim Fraser.
- Tim Fraser.

03:30.800 --> 03:33.790
I've been trying to contact him,
but he's not returning my calls.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.550
The thing is, erm, the
forensics have gone missing.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.990
I don't suppose you saw
what evidence they took?

03:39.040 --> 03:42.030
Hard to know where to look, not
knowing what we're looking for.

03:42.080 --> 03:46.400
Well, I was behind a cordon
but, erm... clothes, I think.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.430
- Blood swabs?
- Yes, probably.

03:50.480 --> 03:52.920
And the saliva from the bite?

03:54.520 --> 03:55.950
I don't remember seeing...

03:56.000 --> 04:00.550
- What did Haverstock do with the forensics?
- I didn't have that much to do with the case.

04:00.600 --> 04:04.000
Len Dorman remembers you, so you must
have had something to do with it.

04:07.160 --> 04:12.350
Look, I'll do everything I can to help,
but... I honestly, I can't remember.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.550
It was such a long time ago and
she was my first dead body...

04:15.600 --> 04:18.000
You must be able to
remember something though.

04:20.240 --> 04:22.630
Like I said, I'll help all I can.

04:22.680 --> 04:24.830
Sorry, excuse me.

04:24.880 --> 04:26.720
Yes.

04:29.280 --> 04:31.670
Yep, right. I'll be straight over.

04:31.720 --> 04:34.110
There's been a development
in the Kamara case.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.790
- We're gonna have to
pick this up later. - OK.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.880
Katherine, why don't you come with me?

04:39.960 --> 04:43.560
- I'm supposed to be looking for the forensics.
- Well, that can wait.

04:44.840 --> 04:47.560
Come on. You said you
wanted a bit of live action.

05:12.600 --> 05:14.830
- George inside?
- With the paramedics.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.990
- What's going on?
- Athif Kamara, his wife's dead.

05:18.040 --> 05:21.030
Hello, Mrs Kamara, good to see you again.

05:21.080 --> 05:22.800
You're not coming in.

05:23.600 --> 05:27.030
Well, if you don't let me in, I shall
presume you've got something to hide.

05:27.080 --> 05:30.160
I'll get a search warrant,
and rip this place apart.

05:33.240 --> 05:35.240
Thank you.

05:40.640 --> 05:42.070
Looks like suicide.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.350
- Right, who found her?
- Athif's mum.

05:44.400 --> 05:46.310
Athif's out of the country, apparently.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.830
She said she, er... didn't get up this
morning, so she went into her bedroom.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.150
Well, call CSM.

05:51.200 --> 05:54.790
Erm, stay down here with Andy. If anything
kicks off, just calm it down, right?

05:54.840 --> 05:56.840
Katherine, you're with me.

06:02.520 --> 06:04.920
Give me a sec, please, will you?

06:22.920 --> 06:24.480
What do you see?

06:31.480 --> 06:33.960
- Blood.
- Is that all?

06:35.080 --> 06:36.960
What do you mean?

06:38.040 --> 06:40.840
The blood's congealed, dark in colour.

06:42.760 --> 06:45.920
There's rigor in the body, she's
cold. Been dead for a while.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.000
Means of death?

06:50.120 --> 06:51.320
Erm...

06:53.000 --> 06:57.400
Incised wounds on both wrists,
lengthways. Caused by small knife.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.190
This your first body?

07:11.960 --> 07:14.160
Laura Fraser was mine.

07:15.880 --> 07:20.400
You see how... little you take in?

07:22.120 --> 07:23.870
She's my sister-in-law! I want to see her!

07:23.920 --> 07:27.110
- It's not a good idea.
- It's OK, it's OK, let her in.

07:27.160 --> 07:29.870
Now, this is a crime scene,
so don't touch anything.

07:29.920 --> 07:33.030
Ah-ah! No, no, no, don't
touch! Come on, out you come.

07:33.080 --> 07:35.710
I don't get it. Why would
Ayeesah do that to herself?

07:35.760 --> 07:37.640
Sit yourself down. All right?

07:40.440 --> 07:43.390
You're Daanish's wife, aren't
you? I saw you at the hospital.

07:43.440 --> 07:45.840
- What's your name?
- Zaheera.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.950
- I'm Elizabeth Bancroft.
- I know who you are.

07:49.000 --> 07:53.640
- You're that bitch that put Daanish away.
- I'm also the bitch who could get him out.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.470
It's not Daanish I want, it's his brother.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.390
If Daanish helps us, we can
help him. Get him to talk to me.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.430
- Athif'd kill us!
- Well, he might anyway!

08:02.480 --> 08:06.720
You are not safe here any more, Zaheera.
Look what's happened to your sister-in-law.

08:07.720 --> 08:13.510
Now, I can get you and your son... It's Rahid,
isn't it? I can get both of you to a safe place.

08:13.560 --> 08:16.590
- Athif'd find us.
- No, no, listen, listen, listen.

08:16.640 --> 08:18.350
I won't let him, all right?

08:18.400 --> 08:22.110
You can leave all of this behind you, but
you have got to get Daanish to talk to me.

08:22.160 --> 08:26.110
Athif's always hugging Rahid. Talks at him, and
I think, what's that bastard saying to my boy?

08:26.160 --> 08:29.400
- Where are you? - Guv!
- Give me that file.

08:30.960 --> 08:33.590
I want you to call me, day or night.

08:33.640 --> 08:35.760
[Mrs Kamara, you can't go up there!]

08:38.200 --> 08:41.590
- What are you doing?
- Taking a statement from your daughter-in-law.

08:41.640 --> 08:45.030
I'll need one from you,
too. Mobiles off, please.

08:45.080 --> 08:48.270
- Er, but it's the husband from the cold case.
- I don't care if it's God.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.910
You don't take calls on my time.

08:49.960 --> 08:53.790
'Hi, you're through to Katherine
Stevens. I'm not available right now.

08:53.840 --> 08:56.130
Leave a message and I'll get back to you.

08:56.880 --> 08:58.550
This is Tim Fraser.

08:58.600 --> 09:02.350
I'll be in court for the rest of the day,
so you won't be able to get hold of me.

09:02.400 --> 09:05.510
I can't see how I can
be of any use anyway.

09:05.560 --> 09:10.840
I said everything 27 years ago and...
Well, I have nothing more to add.

09:21.400 --> 09:22.750
Hi, sweetheart.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.390
There's a party tonight at Shannon's
house. Can I go? Mum said I can.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.470
Well, only if her parents know about it.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.350
- Get me a number for them, will you?
- I'll look so lame!

09:31.400 --> 09:35.270
- Dad, come on. - You know that's
the deal. Text me the number.

09:35.320 --> 09:37.400
OK? I love you.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.710
I can't see how I can
be of any use anyway.

09:40.760 --> 09:44.000
I said everything 27 years ago and...

09:45.160 --> 09:47.320
- Hey.
- Andy!

09:48.920 --> 09:51.670
- Bancroft hates people on their phones.
- Yes, I know.

09:51.720 --> 09:55.030
I'm just... I'm meant to
be doing this cold case.

09:55.080 --> 09:57.320
- Why did she bring you here?
- I don't know.

09:58.800 --> 10:00.390
I nearly puked on the body.

10:00.440 --> 10:03.360
Don't worry about it.
Everybody does that first time.

10:07.720 --> 10:11.040
You look like shit. Are you all right?

10:12.920 --> 10:15.110
I want to see you. When can I?

10:15.160 --> 10:17.640
Get in the car, please, Katherine.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.000
Are you all right, guv?

10:30.520 --> 10:32.280
Ayeesah was my informant.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.470
It was an arranged
marriage, she was unhappy.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.430
She came to me. I worked
on her. I turned her.

10:40.480 --> 10:42.240
She was good.

10:43.240 --> 10:46.270
The op last week, because of her,
we knew the drugs were coming in.

10:46.320 --> 10:50.150
And then Daanish turns up instead
of Athif. I just should have...

10:50.200 --> 10:52.510
I just should have known that he'd twig.

10:52.560 --> 10:55.630
- Do you think he killed her?
- Well, not directly.

10:55.680 --> 10:58.000
Perhaps Mrs Kamara did the honours.

11:00.400 --> 11:03.910
- Well, it's not your fault.
- I can't see that it's anyone else's.

11:03.960 --> 11:07.670
And if that's not bad enough, I've got
to speak at Charlie Haverstock's funeral.

11:07.720 --> 11:09.720
I'm the last person...

11:11.000 --> 11:12.800
I just don't know what I'm gonna say.

11:15.360 --> 11:18.600
Just... Just be honest about
him. That's what people want.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.590
Right. OK, how do I look?

11:32.640 --> 11:34.480
Erm...

11:35.600 --> 11:36.870
There.

11:37.920 --> 11:39.270
You've been a real help today.

11:39.320 --> 11:40.870
Thanks, Katherine.

11:40.920 --> 11:44.710
Then he said, "If I had to arrest my
own mother, I'd call for back-up."

11:46.260 --> 11:47.470
Charlie always made it fun.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.440
He was resilient.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.760
He was ambitious.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.760
He gave everything to the job.

11:58.160 --> 12:00.920
But he was also a family man.

12:02.280 --> 12:05.800
And his sense of family didn't just
extend to Julie and the girls...

12:07.240 --> 12:09.200
.. but to all of us.

12:10.320 --> 12:14.480
Having someone senior to
you who believes in you...

12:16.360 --> 12:18.120
.. it makes a huge difference.

12:21.320 --> 12:24.440
I wouldn't be where I am
today if it wasn't for him.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.000
We all loved him.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.320
I know I did.

12:42.480 --> 12:44.480
Goodbye, Charlie.

12:49.840 --> 12:53.230
It was good. A very good
turn-out. I'm very pleased, yeah.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.280
Lovely to see you.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.750
Why's Katherine Stevens here?
You're land-grabbing her!

13:02.800 --> 13:05.590
- I needed her for the Kamara case.
- For a stalled op?

13:05.640 --> 13:07.230
Athif Kamara's still out there.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.350
Your cold cases aren't exactly delivering.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.470
You've got her on one, she hasn't
even got any forensic evidence!

13:12.520 --> 13:16.230
There's plenty more where that one
came from. We just got unlucky.

13:16.280 --> 13:19.150
Back to the station.
You've wasted a whole day.

13:19.200 --> 13:21.550
- Sorry. Guv...
- No, no, the Fraser case is closed.

13:21.600 --> 13:24.350
- You're moving on to the next one.
- I'm trying to tell you.

13:24.400 --> 13:27.840
I've been speaking to Dr Karim.
She's found the forensics.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.110
- Win your case?
- Yeah.

13:51.160 --> 13:53.720
- Yeah, it went well.
- Well done.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.270
I'm going out to the cinema with Rachel.

14:00.320 --> 14:01.430
Oh.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.150
Well, I thought that you were...

14:03.200 --> 14:06.550
There's a lasagne in the fridge. You
just have to put it in the microwave.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.160
See you later, love.

14:10.640 --> 14:12.520
Come on. I'll drive you.

14:14.120 --> 14:17.030
Pick you up at midnight, OK?

14:17.080 --> 14:19.280
- One o'clock?
- Twelve-thirty.

14:20.360 --> 14:24.430
Why are you so stressy about me?
Other people's dads are cool.

14:24.480 --> 14:27.710
Well, other people's dads
probably have lots of children.

14:27.760 --> 14:30.110
You're the only one I've got.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.600
And you're growing up so fast.

14:35.160 --> 14:38.640
- They look older than you.
- Shannon's sharing it with her sister.

14:39.720 --> 14:41.680
You didn't tell me that!

14:47.440 --> 14:51.240
- What was the husband like?
- Devastated, as far as I remember.

14:52.280 --> 14:54.280
I've got his statement.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.520
They'd only been married nine months.

14:58.480 --> 15:02.760
- It's awful. He lost his
baby and... And his wife. - Mm.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.790
- Have you talked to him yet?
- I've tried.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.470
Well, don't get his hopes up.

15:08.520 --> 15:11.030
I want you to hold off until
the forensics come back.

15:11.080 --> 15:14.510
- Where did Dr Karim find them?
- Mayfields storage?

15:14.560 --> 15:16.910
Yeah, Mayfields, I know it.

15:16.960 --> 15:20.950
We used to use it. They had a back-up
generator in case of power cuts.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.550
What's she got?

15:22.600 --> 15:26.510
Blood samples were tested at the
time, but they were from the victim.

15:26.560 --> 15:29.510
Now, what we're really
interested in is that saliva swab.

15:29.560 --> 15:33.270
Yeah. What you've got to remember there
though is that evidence is 30 years old.

15:33.320 --> 15:36.950
- That swab could be degraded. - But it
could give us the DNA profile of the killer.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.710
I don't want you to get
emotionally involved in this.

15:39.760 --> 15:41.760
It's hard not to.

15:42.520 --> 15:48.000
I just... I hate the idea that there's
someone out there, free, who killed her.

15:50.720 --> 15:54.550
Well, if it was a junkie, and
Charlie always thought it was,

15:54.600 --> 15:56.800
then they're almost certainly dead by now.

15:57.920 --> 16:00.510
Who's picking up the forensics tomorrow?

16:00.760 --> 16:02.060
I am, first thing.

16:04.900 --> 16:06.000
Is that my Joe?

16:07.520 --> 16:08.800
We're just friends.

16:10.120 --> 16:11.870
Hm.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.910
I can see you two getting on.

16:13.960 --> 16:16.630
You know he's terrible at
making the first move though.

16:16.680 --> 16:18.830
He's only ever had a few girlfriends.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.000
I mean, I... I do like him.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.790
But I'm not sure I'm his type.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.040
Mm.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.100
You mean you're not sure he's your type.

16:34.080 --> 16:36.750
Married men more your thing, are they?

16:36.800 --> 16:38.560
Like Andy Bevan?

16:40.360 --> 16:43.800
Oh, I know. I know.

16:45.680 --> 16:49.240
It's the danger that's so much fun,
isn't it? And the sex is great.

16:51.240 --> 16:53.640
But it never ends well.

16:57.200 --> 17:00.320
Why don't you give a nice
boy a chance for once, hm?

17:03.120 --> 17:06.280
Go on. You can ring Joe from my office.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.630
- Hiya.
- Hi.

17:58.680 --> 18:03.040
So I've, erm... I've got us like a table
in town. It's just a little Italian thing.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.400
What was that for?

18:13.440 --> 18:15.440
Let's skip dinner.

18:25.640 --> 18:27.950
[Hey!]

18:28.000 --> 18:29.880
- [All right?]
- [You all right?]

18:31.320 --> 18:33.320
- [All right?]
- [There he is. All right?]

18:46.320 --> 18:48.800
Down! Down! Down! Down! Down!

19:00.600 --> 19:01.870
Dad!

19:01.920 --> 19:05.590
It's only NOS! Everybody does
it! And I wasn't even taking it!

19:05.640 --> 19:08.910
Well, I don't care. I don't want you
at a party where other people are!

19:08.960 --> 19:12.590
- You're just so over the top.
- Because I love you and I worry about you.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.760
You don't need to! I
can look after myself.

19:23.440 --> 19:27.760
You're probably right, and you
probably can look after yourself.

19:29.160 --> 19:33.000
But isn't it better that I'm
overprotective than not protective at all?

19:34.280 --> 19:36.280
Not really.

19:37.840 --> 19:40.000
Bad things happen, Amber. You...

19:41.200 --> 19:43.680
You just don't think
they'll ever happen to you.

19:48.640 --> 19:51.880
What's the matter? What's happened?

19:54.120 --> 19:57.560
- Dad?
- They've re-opened her case.

19:59.560 --> 20:03.080
- Her? Your first wife?
- Mm.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.470
But, I mean, isn't that a good thing?

20:06.520 --> 20:10.550
They might find out who did it.
Are you helping the police?

20:10.600 --> 20:13.070
As far as I can work out,
they have no new evidence.

20:13.120 --> 20:14.510
They might find some!

20:14.560 --> 20:18.070
It's ridiculous, dredging it all up.
I'm not having anything to do with it.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.680
I am starving.

20:35.680 --> 20:37.520
Let's get a takeaway.

20:42.840 --> 20:44.560
Don't you cook at all?

20:46.120 --> 20:48.030
I can't be bothered to think about food.

20:48.080 --> 20:50.430
Oh, God, you're just like Mum.

20:50.480 --> 20:53.640
She doesn't switch off. Nothing but work.

20:54.600 --> 20:56.600
I'm not surprised.

20:57.480 --> 20:59.480
Your mum not switching off.

21:00.800 --> 21:05.360
This Kamara case is really
intense. A girl died today.

21:06.640 --> 21:10.230
And your mum, she really held it together.

21:10.280 --> 21:13.480
You're not, like, working
with her, are you?

21:14.400 --> 21:16.400
No, it was just one day.

21:17.920 --> 21:19.400
Can you...

21:20.600 --> 21:22.430
Can you not tell her about us?

21:22.480 --> 21:26.350
It's just she gets really funny
with my girlfriends and stuff.

21:26.900 --> 21:27.530
Erm...

21:28.080 --> 21:32.550
- She just... She saw off my ex.
- How? With a shotgun?

21:34.080 --> 21:37.680
No, it's just, erm, she just
doesn't like competition.

21:38.840 --> 21:40.870
I'm not competition.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.920
Yes, you are.

22:57.480 --> 22:59.630
Hi, you're through to Katherine Stevens.

22:59.680 --> 23:02.910
I'm not available right now, so leave
a message and I'll get back to you.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.510
Hey, Katherine, it's me, Anya.

23:05.560 --> 23:08.190
Mayfields is literally on my way home,

23:08.240 --> 23:11.520
so I'm going to drop in
now and get the forensics.

24:06.080 --> 24:09.080
Look, I'm sorry for the
delay. Kids smashed my car.

24:10.720 --> 24:13.830
Right, here we are. Cold
storage in the basement.

24:13.880 --> 24:15.680
Thank you.

24:33.920 --> 24:37.560
'Doors open. Lift going up.

24:58.500 --> 24:59.380
Hello?

25:02.740 --> 25:04.410
Hey! Hey! Stop!

25:05.460 --> 25:06.360
Hey!

25:13.180 --> 25:13.740
Stop!

25:48.040 --> 25:51.870
Pathology report's back on Ayeesah Kamara.
She had a sleeping drug in her system.

25:51.920 --> 25:55.030
But it's one the doctor prescribed,
so there's no joy there.

25:55.080 --> 25:57.110
And her fingerprints are on the knife.

25:57.160 --> 26:00.590
- If the family killed her, we can't prove it.
- What about Athif Kamara?

26:00.640 --> 26:02.590
Interpol located him in Belgrade.

26:02.640 --> 26:05.830
- What's he doing there?
- He could be looking for a new drugs supplier.

26:05.880 --> 26:08.240
Why go all the way to Serbia?

26:10.040 --> 26:11.670
Bancroft?

26:11.720 --> 26:14.350
I reckon he's into something new.

26:14.400 --> 26:18.400
Interpol have got eyes on him and I can
have another go at the brother. Excuse me.

26:19.680 --> 26:21.720
Sorry. I've got to take this, Sir.

26:24.080 --> 26:27.830
- Bancroft.
- It's Zaheera. I have to see you.

26:27.880 --> 26:31.790
Security guards say they get break-ins,
but they normally stick to the exterior.

26:31.840 --> 26:34.950
Mayfields is a disgrace. Should
have been closed down years ago.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.110
You sure you don't want
to file a complaint?

26:37.160 --> 26:40.670
We got what we needed. Physical
evidence from the crime scene.

26:40.720 --> 26:44.550
- Not much of it.
- Anything that wasn't direct crime scene

26:44.600 --> 26:47.750
would have been given back to the
family. That could be worth a look.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.590
Yeah. I need to pay Len Dorman a
visit. I'll see what he's got.

26:50.640 --> 26:53.600
- Meantime, I'll start with this.
- Right.

26:54.800 --> 26:58.110
And his mother keeps yelling at me,
what was I talking to you about?

26:58.160 --> 27:01.950
She says when Athif gets
back, he'll get it out of me.

27:02.000 --> 27:05.200
He's been mad ever since that drug
deal went wrong, and now Ayeesah.

27:07.120 --> 27:10.910
I don't want the same thing
to happen to me, or Rahid.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.190
So how does it work?

27:13.240 --> 27:14.840
You protecting us.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.670
Different city, different
name. Safe location.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.710
And Daanish? What happens to him?

27:20.760 --> 27:25.400
He gives me what I need and he'll
get a much shorter sentence.

27:27.800 --> 27:29.590
And Athif?

27:29.640 --> 27:31.520
Don't worry about Athif.

27:32.320 --> 27:34.870
I'll make sure he goes
down for a very long time.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.120
Come on.

27:38.560 --> 27:40.640
You haven't been honest
with me, Mr Dorman.

27:41.720 --> 27:43.920
You didn't tell me you
had a criminal record.

27:45.200 --> 27:46.870
I was at Orgreave.

27:46.920 --> 27:49.390
They charged me with violent disorder.

27:49.440 --> 27:50.830
It was a bloody disgrace.

27:50.880 --> 27:55.200
Your lot had horses and dogs. They
chased us down the village street.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.560
There's another conviction, isn't there?

27:59.920 --> 28:02.680
In 1988, for burglary.

28:04.600 --> 28:07.440
You try getting a job
when the pits are closing.

28:09.960 --> 28:13.320
I got in with some bad people,
I did some stupid things.

28:14.320 --> 28:15.750
I regret it.

28:15.800 --> 28:18.950
Because when I was inside,
that's when Laura met him.

28:19.000 --> 28:19.870
Tim Fraser?

28:21.920 --> 28:26.400
By the time I got out, they
were married... and I'd lost her.

28:28.160 --> 28:31.000
- What do you mean?
- He didn't like me.

28:31.920 --> 28:34.030
You should have seen him
when he come up here.

28:34.080 --> 28:37.030
He looked like he wanted
to stick a peg on his nose.

28:37.080 --> 28:40.710
I have tried to contact Mr Fraser,
but he's not getting back to me.

28:40.760 --> 28:43.230
I don't think she really loved him.

28:43.280 --> 28:47.360
Oh, she wanted the money and the
big house, and I don't blame her...

28:48.680 --> 28:51.000
But underneath all that polish...

28:52.320 --> 28:55.560
.. she was a miner's daughter
and he was a police lawyer.

28:58.080 --> 29:00.080
How's the case going?

29:01.520 --> 29:05.280
Yeah. We're hoping to raise a DNA profile.

29:06.680 --> 29:10.350
And we also want to re-examine
any physical evidence.

29:10.400 --> 29:14.280
Did the police return any items
from Laura's house to you?

29:17.480 --> 29:19.360
I've got a box in the attic.

29:20.680 --> 29:21.960
I'll look it out.

29:25.920 --> 29:28.150
There you go.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.200
I haven't touched any of it.

29:31.360 --> 29:32.720
Thanks.

29:54.800 --> 29:56.280
You might want to watch this.

29:57.760 --> 30:00.240
I haven't. Not since...

30:02.080 --> 30:03.710
Thanks.

30:03.760 --> 30:05.630
Why isn't Tim Fraser talking to you?

30:05.680 --> 30:07.550
Don't worry, I'll get in touch with him.

30:07.600 --> 30:11.520
And I'll be in touch with you, although
it would help if you had a mobile.

30:12.520 --> 30:13.870
I've got one.

30:13.920 --> 30:16.030
I've had no reason to switch it on.

30:16.080 --> 30:17.240
Until now.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.310
- Hiya.
- Bad news, I'm afraid.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.550
- The sample was degraded.
- How can that happen?

30:31.600 --> 30:35.400
It could have been left out of the fridge,
got too warm, or just left in the light.

30:37.240 --> 30:39.240
I don't believe it.

30:40.280 --> 30:44.630
I want you to get out of here.
I just want us to be together.

30:44.680 --> 30:46.110
Don't worry, we will.

30:46.160 --> 30:49.750
- What happened to Ayeesah?
- If she grassed, it serves her right, don't it?

30:49.800 --> 30:51.800
What, that they kill her?

30:53.280 --> 30:55.120
Come on, Daan, you don't mean that.

30:59.040 --> 31:01.120
It'll be us next.

31:02.240 --> 31:05.350
Your mum, she's wants me and
Rahid to come and live with her.

31:05.400 --> 31:09.200
- What? - I will slit my
own wrists before I do.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.480
Za, she told me about Ayeesah.

31:38.920 --> 31:41.160
You think she didn't kill herself.

31:44.720 --> 31:48.030
Do you think your mother or
your brother could be capable?

31:51.680 --> 31:53.000
What's so funny?

31:56.880 --> 32:00.550
Athif did that. When I was 12.

32:00.600 --> 32:02.280
With pliers.

32:03.400 --> 32:05.640
I'm screaming the house down and my mum...

32:07.400 --> 32:11.200
.. she cleans the pliers in the sink
and she puts them back in the toolbox.

32:13.360 --> 32:15.160
They're capable.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.600
So what are you gonna do about it?

32:26.040 --> 32:30.280
In the hospital, you said
you'd let me run Highwater.

32:31.560 --> 32:34.070
- Do you mean that?
- Yes. You can pick up the business.

32:34.120 --> 32:36.430
- You help me as and when I need it.
- Back-handers?

32:36.480 --> 32:38.920
No. This isn't about money.

32:40.400 --> 32:42.280
I want stability.

32:43.720 --> 32:48.760
Crime doesn't go away, it
just needs to be... controlled.

32:51.440 --> 32:53.280
You and I could do that together.

33:00.480 --> 33:02.630
I'll talk.

33:02.680 --> 33:04.630
But not until you make Za and Rahid safe.

33:04.680 --> 33:05.950
Consider it done.

33:06.000 --> 33:10.040
And when you've got Athif, you lock him up
good and you throw away the fucking key.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.790
Get onto Witness Protection.

33:16.840 --> 33:19.750
I want Zaheera in safe accommodation
before Athif gets back

33:19.800 --> 33:23.000
and I need a risk assessment
on how to pick her up.

33:24.320 --> 33:26.080
Go on ahead. I'll catch you up.

33:27.440 --> 33:29.590
So, how did it go with the forensics?

33:30.140 --> 33:33.720
Well, the saliva swab's degraded,
so we can't raise a DNA profile.

33:35.720 --> 33:37.640
Yeah. Oh, I'm sorry.

33:45.120 --> 33:50.760
Best thing is just to move onto the next file...
and don't let Bancroft distract you this time.

33:52.160 --> 33:56.390
- She was helping me.
- Bancroft doesn't help anyone but Bancroft.

33:56.440 --> 33:59.000
What was her excuse for
meddling in this anyway?

34:00.640 --> 34:03.590
She worked the Fraser Case.
She was first on the scene.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.200
- Bancroft worked the
Fraser case? - Yep.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.940
Did you say there was corruption involved?

34:10.920 --> 34:13.880
Not corruption. Negligence maybe.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.750
She's been jumpy about
it since the get-off,

34:17.800 --> 34:22.110
wanting to move you across,
telling me to close it down.

34:22.159 --> 34:25.550
Well, that can't be right. She's
been really, really good about it.

34:25.600 --> 34:29.960
You haven't got the DNA, all right.
Have you got anything else to go on?

34:31.080 --> 34:34.679
Well, we've got physical evidence
from Mayfields and Len Dorman had some.

34:35.760 --> 34:37.389
Get Dr Karim to test it.

34:37.440 --> 34:41.310
Let's see what she can find. On the QT.

34:41.360 --> 34:43.429
- But, guv...
- Officially, this case is closed,

34:43.480 --> 34:45.070
so no talking about it.

34:45.120 --> 34:47.320
Do you understand, Katherine?

34:48.440 --> 34:49.750
Yes, guv.

34:49.800 --> 34:54.199
If you find anything,
you come straight to me.

35:16.880 --> 35:20.990
Er, listen, darling, I'm gonna have to talk
to this gentleman, so you go on without me.

35:21.040 --> 35:22.600
See you tonight.

35:31.480 --> 35:37.680
Look, I'm not going to get myself wound
up in some pointless wild-goose chase.

35:39.000 --> 35:43.910
- You call finding Laura's killer pointless?
- We've all had to put it behind us, Len.

35:43.960 --> 35:45.230
I haven't.

35:45.280 --> 35:48.240
I want to know who stabbed
that knife into her.

35:49.400 --> 35:52.710
Whose was the last face she
looked at and why they did it.

35:52.760 --> 35:57.710
But most of all, more than
anything, I want them to pay.

35:57.760 --> 35:59.120
I know.

36:04.800 --> 36:07.630
If she hadn't have married
you, she wouldn't have died.

36:07.680 --> 36:10.310
Wouldn't have been in
that house, on her own.

36:10.360 --> 36:14.480
A burglar broke in and murdered
her. You can't attribute blame to me.

36:17.880 --> 36:19.280
You don't care, do you?

36:21.960 --> 36:24.350
You never loved her.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.160
That is not true.

36:28.960 --> 36:30.840
Look, the whole thing...

36:32.880 --> 36:35.310
It was... It was so intense.

36:35.360 --> 36:38.390
And... And look, we were young.

36:38.440 --> 36:41.510
Not much older than my daughter is now.

36:41.560 --> 36:44.110
Yeah, and your girl would
have had a sister or a brother,

36:44.160 --> 36:46.150
if they hadn't been murdered inside Laura.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.600
Do you think that I haven't
thought about that?

36:49.640 --> 36:52.510
This is our last chance
to find out what happened.

36:52.560 --> 36:54.750
We won't get another one.

36:54.800 --> 36:58.470
- Why won't you help?
- Because unless the police have new evidence,

36:58.520 --> 37:02.310
they will never solve a murder
that happened 27 years ago.

37:02.360 --> 37:06.270
There's lots of cold cases that get solved
now, and you haven't seen this policewoman.

37:06.320 --> 37:10.230
She's going through all the old
evidence. It's being analysed in a lab.

37:10.280 --> 37:13.440
I mean, who's to say that
they won't find something?

37:19.240 --> 37:20.760
You're hiding something.

37:21.800 --> 37:23.520
I resent that suggestion.

37:25.240 --> 37:26.910
So prove me wrong.

37:26.960 --> 37:29.480
Go and talk to DS Stevens.

37:38.080 --> 37:39.350
Moved on?

37:39.400 --> 37:40.870
Yeah.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.070
I've already forgotten
the name Laura Fraser.

37:44.120 --> 37:45.630
Oh. Well, that's good.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.400
Are you seeing Joe tonight?

37:48.520 --> 37:51.190
We haven't got anything planned.

37:51.240 --> 37:54.070
He... He doesn't know that
you know about us, by the way.

37:54.620 --> 37:56.400
Right, well, I won't let on.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.990
Oh, erm, do you bowl?

38:00.040 --> 38:03.910
- I can. Yeah. - Great. Come out
with the Kamara team tonight.

38:03.960 --> 38:07.230
We're celebrating, and I'm sick of
being the only woman on the team.

38:07.280 --> 38:09.320
OK. I'd love to.

38:13.720 --> 38:15.710
- Yes!
- Yes!

38:17.260 --> 38:18.210
Did you see that?

38:18.760 --> 38:21.150
- Hiya
- Guys, guys. New team member.

38:21.200 --> 38:24.590
- I'll go on your team, shall I?
- No, go... Go with Andy.

38:24.640 --> 38:27.990
He needs all the help
he can get. Go on. Andy.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.670
Did you see that?

38:32.760 --> 38:34.830
So, middle finger in that hole there.

38:34.880 --> 38:36.110
- Yeah.
- Bit of a run-up.

38:36.160 --> 38:38.920
Katherine told me she could play.

38:43.440 --> 38:45.870
- Whoo!
- She can.

38:48.640 --> 38:51.350
- You should have put her with us.
- Ah, never mind.

38:51.400 --> 38:53.550
She's keeping Andy happy.

38:53.600 --> 38:56.150
He needs it. His wife's left him.

38:56.200 --> 38:57.710
Seriously?

38:57.760 --> 39:00.790
- Mm-hm. Walked out with the kids. - Oh!

39:00.840 --> 39:02.480
He's gutted.

39:03.760 --> 39:05.270
Elizabeth.

39:05.320 --> 39:07.270
Oh, hi, boss.

39:07.320 --> 39:10.670
Erm, didn't realise this was
one of your local haunts.

39:10.720 --> 39:16.110
I've got the shirt. No, I think I'll leave,
er... it all to the rest of you tonight.

39:16.160 --> 39:18.590
- I hear your man's
about to talk. - Yeah.

39:18.640 --> 39:21.830
Good. We need to know what
that brother of his is up to.

39:21.880 --> 39:23.430
Well, the bigger it is, the better.

39:23.480 --> 39:26.470
We catch him, we put him away. Then
after him, we go for the mother.

39:26.520 --> 39:30.470
- Have you got anything on her?
- No, not yet, but I will have.

39:30.520 --> 39:33.080
She killed my informant.
I won't forget that.

39:35.440 --> 39:39.590
We will be interviewing internally
for the Chief Super job.

39:39.640 --> 39:42.070
- You should be confident.
- Really?

39:42.120 --> 39:45.800
Elizabeth, you could eat those
other candidates for breakfast.

39:47.720 --> 39:50.800
I've put some money
behind the bar. Well done.

40:00.000 --> 40:02.480
- I'm gonna get a strike.
- We'll see about that.

40:11.760 --> 40:13.750
Whoo!

40:13.800 --> 40:16.640
Guv? Guv?

40:18.800 --> 40:20.350
Guv?

40:20.400 --> 40:22.710
Erm, you... You give me a
minute. Take my go. Go on.

40:22.760 --> 40:25.190
- Sure? - Yeah, go on.
You're better than me anyway.

40:25.240 --> 40:27.800
[Let's get a drink.]

41:06.720 --> 41:08.070
Go home! Go home!

41:08.120 --> 41:09.910
Sorry. Sorry.

41:09.960 --> 41:11.400
Go on. Go on.

41:12.320 --> 41:17.310
OK, so, for once... the Sam Smiths
have done some tidy rolling.

41:17.360 --> 41:18.950
20 ahead.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.590
- We only need two strikes, guv.
- All right.

41:21.640 --> 41:23.280
I will see what I can do.

41:24.880 --> 41:27.670
Right, here we go. Ready?
Mwah! I'm gonna do it.

41:27.720 --> 41:29.030
Yeah, yeah.

41:29.080 --> 41:30.480
Go on. They're all going down.

41:35.240 --> 41:37.310
- Oh, yes!
- How's she done that?

41:37.360 --> 41:39.950
- Go on!
- How's she done that?

41:40.000 --> 41:43.030
Question is, can she do it again?

41:43.080 --> 41:45.070
- Right.
- Come on. Come on.

41:45.120 --> 41:46.440
Come on!

41:55.480 --> 41:56.670
- Come on!
- Yes!

41:56.720 --> 41:58.830
- Come on!
- You win some, you lose some.

41:58.880 --> 42:00.480
I'm sorry, mate.

42:20.280 --> 42:22.710
Joe! Joe!

42:22.760 --> 42:24.430
Wait!

42:39.680 --> 42:41.560
Hello.

42:43.040 --> 42:45.030
Laura's blood is on the jewellery box.

42:45.080 --> 42:46.710
It's a gloved fingerprint.

42:46.760 --> 42:51.200
And there's more on the other side,
where someone's tried to wipe it off.

42:53.080 --> 42:57.110
So you're saying that Laura's
lying dead downstairs

42:57.160 --> 43:02.200
and the burglar goes upstairs, puts
on gloves and ransacks the bedroom?

43:03.200 --> 43:04.670
That doesn't make any sense.

43:04.720 --> 43:07.520
Yes, it does, if he was setting
it up to look like a burglary.

43:08.960 --> 43:10.790
A staged burglary and break-in.

43:10.840 --> 43:13.030
And there's more.

43:13.080 --> 43:16.790
This was kept as evidence because
of the blood spatter on it.

43:16.840 --> 43:19.510
But that's not what's
interesting about it.

43:19.560 --> 43:23.070
It contains glass particles that
were on top of the blood spatter.

43:23.120 --> 43:25.630
It tells us the window was
broken after the murder.

43:25.680 --> 43:27.070
(Shit!)

43:27.120 --> 43:29.630
This changes everything.

43:29.680 --> 43:31.910
Someone knew what they were doing.

43:31.960 --> 43:34.320
Wasn't the husband a CPS lawyer?

43:35.440 --> 43:37.070
Yeah. Yeah, but he had an alibi.

43:37.120 --> 43:38.510
I'll re-check it though.

43:38.560 --> 43:42.310
Look at friends, anyone who
Laura could let in, or had a key.

43:42.360 --> 43:44.960
Although how we find
her mates, I don't know.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.790
I've got the Frasers' wedding video.

43:49.840 --> 43:51.440
I'll start there.

44:03.280 --> 44:06.120
I didn't know about
Katherine and Andy Bevan.

44:07.800 --> 44:09.560
I'm sorry.

44:12.160 --> 44:14.200
- Are they...?
- He's married.

44:15.400 --> 44:18.300
Rumour has it they've been
shagging for the past six months.

45:22.200 --> 45:24.070
'Welcome, everybody.

45:24.120 --> 45:28.430
This is the marriage of Laura and Tim

45:28.480 --> 45:30.520
who welcome you here today.

45:31.680 --> 45:35.120
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here in the sight of God...
