02:45.248 --> 02:46.124
[Celeste] Hello?

02:46.541 --> 02:47.834
[Celeste] It's an emergency.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.044
[Celeste] We need an ambulance right now!

[Reporters] <i> It has been confirmed</i>

03:03.099 --> 03:07.896

03:36.382 --> 03:38.051
[Ruffo] <i>Without his endorsement,</i>

<i>the Attorney General wouldn't</i>

ATTORNEY GENERAL OFFICE

04:01.449 --> 04:02.700
Gentlemen.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.207
Thank you for coming.

04:09.874 --> 04:13.962
I know you are overwhelmed,
but I thought it best to talk in person.

04:16.172 --> 04:19.634
The potential arrest of contractors

04:19.716 --> 04:22.762
may have consequences somewhat...

04:23.388 --> 04:24.764
-Profound?
-Precisely!

04:25.598 --> 04:28.685
But they could take the operation
to another level.

04:28.768 --> 04:31.145
A level that's not often visited.

04:31.229 --> 04:32.522
[Cláudio] Not visited at all.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.941
-[Cláudio] Untouchable.
-[Dimas] Political agents.

04:35.024 --> 04:37.110
They've learned to protect themselves.

04:37.193 --> 04:41.072
Political forces have always been a part
of this scheme but until today...

04:41.155 --> 04:42.407
[Attorney] From here on,

04:42.657 --> 04:44.409
we're in uncharted territory.

04:44.492 --> 04:46.911
-The financing of the electoral system.
-Yes.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.246
[Cláudio] Timely...

04:48.663 --> 04:49.664
...don't you think?

04:56.671 --> 04:59.507
[he inhales and exhales deeply]

05:02.593 --> 05:05.305
The Attorney General Office
will stand by you.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.473
[Dimas inhales deeply]

05:11.936 --> 05:12.937
[Dimas] Excuse me.

05:17.608 --> 05:19.277
[Ruffo] <i>The idea of putting behind bars</i>

05:19.360 --> 05:23.281
<i>the most corrupt contractors</i>
<i>in the country pleased me.</i>

05:24.907 --> 05:27.201
[Ruffo] <i>Because it meant</i>
<i>something rare here.</i>

05:27.869 --> 05:29.037
[Ruffo] <i>Justice.</i>

05:30.913 --> 05:32.040
[Ruffo] <i>But in Brazil...</i>

05:32.415 --> 05:34.876
<i>...the dictionary definition of justice</i>

05:34.959 --> 05:37.837
<i>doesn't include the words</i>
<i>"balance" or "impartiality".</i>

05:39.797 --> 05:42.133
[Ruffo] <i>Much less "order and progress".</i>

05:45.678 --> 05:48.139
[Ruffo] <i>The death of Mário Garcez Brito</i>
<i>dissolved the deal</i>

05:48.222 --> 05:50.850
<i>and opened the door</i>
<i>to a new stage in the operation.</i>

05:52.268 --> 05:53.352
[Ruffo] <i>Fuck.</i>

05:54.729 --> 05:56.689
[Ruffo] <i>I didn't celebrate</i>
<i>the Wizard's death</i>

05:57.273 --> 06:01.486
<i>because Ibrahim fulfilled his plea bargain</i>
<i>and was released the day after.</i>

06:03.154 --> 06:04.155
Pull up your pants.

06:06.157 --> 06:07.450
[slams feet on desk]

06:10.203 --> 06:11.287
[Ibrahim inhales]

06:11.996 --> 06:13.414
Pretty useful, huh?

06:14.665 --> 06:16.918
An interesting invention.

06:18.294 --> 06:21.130
You can monitor me,
know where I am at any time.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.840
[electric screwdriver whirs]

06:23.633 --> 06:27.345
It must be uncomfortable at night.
I wonder if it'll shock me in the shower.

06:29.138 --> 06:32.475
Anyway, sleeping at home
is more comfortable.

06:32.850 --> 06:35.269
Guilty and free to go, huh?
Just like in 2003.

06:35.353 --> 06:36.354
Yes.

06:37.021 --> 06:39.065
[Ibrahim] Don't worry too much
about me, Deputy.

06:39.148 --> 06:41.109
There's bigger fish in this pond.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.945
Do you want me to thank you?
Is that it?

06:44.946 --> 06:47.740
I handed you the biggest
contractors in the country.

06:48.407 --> 06:50.076
That doesn't make you any better.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.078
It makes you worse.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.333
[Ibrahim laughs]

06:57.416 --> 06:59.919
Are you done? Thank you.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.090
Comfortable.

07:05.591 --> 07:07.426
Hey, boy, can you fetch me a cab?

07:13.474 --> 07:14.392

07:14.475 --> 07:17.228

07:46.841 --> 07:49.802
<i>He will be wearing an ankle monitor</i>

07:52.472 --> 07:55.266

08:50.613 --> 08:53.533
[Ruffo] Regina, I want to show you
something. Come with me.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.451
[Ruffo] The fractals!

08:56.536 --> 08:59.080
The fractals Beta's always watching.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.583
That's the mechanism.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.800
[Ruffo] The mechanism has
the same pattern as the fractals.

09:10.883 --> 09:11.884
CONTRACTORS

09:12.677 --> 09:13.761
CURRENCY DEALER

09:16.722 --> 09:17.807
POLITICIANS

09:17.890 --> 09:20.268
[Ruffo] An operating mode
that feeds itself

09:20.768 --> 09:23.020

what doesn't belong.

09:24.438 --> 09:26.941
[breathing heavily]

09:27.024 --> 09:29.860
The mechanism is in everything.
Do you understand?

09:29.944 --> 09:30.945
In everything.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.281
From the government to Mr. João.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.367
[Ruffo] On the macro and micro levels.
It's a pattern.

09:39.829 --> 09:43.583
The economic power
and the public agents work together.

09:44.542 --> 09:47.336
Politicians appoint boards
that apportion projects

09:47.420 --> 09:49.130
among the same contractors.

09:49.213 --> 09:52.341
[Ruffo] They overbill the projects
and give back some of the budget

09:52.425 --> 09:55.011
to the politicians, the board,
in the form of a bribe.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.138
It's a self-perpetuating system. Get it?

09:57.221 --> 09:58.514
[he breathes heavily]

09:58.598 --> 10:00.558
[Ruffo] From Petrobrasil to Sanesul,

10:00.641 --> 10:02.059
Miller &amp; Bretch to Mr. João, Ibrahim to Alfredo,

10:03.644 --> 10:05.229
the mechanism is in everything.

10:05.313 --> 10:09.317
Workers cheating parking meters,
fake IDs to get into places...

10:10.443 --> 10:13.529
...bribing the police officer
so he won't give you a ticket.

10:14.822 --> 10:18.117
The rich get richer
and the poor get poorer.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.494
There's no political party.

10:21.537 --> 10:22.747
There's no ideology.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.417
There's no left or right wing.

10:27.752 --> 10:31.172
Whoever is in charge must keep
the wheel turning. It's a pattern.

10:32.340 --> 10:35.968
And that's what's elected
every single president so far.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.095
Those who don't participate are spit out.

10:38.846 --> 10:39.764
Everything.

10:42.099 --> 10:43.267
[quietly] Everything.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.727
[quietly] Everything...

10:45.102 --> 10:46.479
...is the mechanism.

10:47.063 --> 10:47.938
[Ruffo] Everything.

10:48.814 --> 10:50.399
And what can you do with this?

11:00.993 --> 11:01.827
Nothing.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.872
You won't stop.

11:04.955 --> 11:05.873

[Verena] Silvério Anunciato benefitted
from the plea bargain,

12:12.356 --> 12:15.568
and we still don't have enough
evidence to arrest Ricardo Bretch.

12:15.651 --> 12:17.611
[Verena] For now, only search and seizure.

12:17.695 --> 12:21.449
[Verena] We're 300 federal officers
working simultaneously in seven states.

12:22.366 --> 12:25.119
[Verena] Here in São Paulo,
we'll enforce six arrest warrants

12:25.202 --> 12:28.372
and 16 search and seizure warrants
in homes and offices.

12:29.081 --> 12:33.169
[Verena] Targets have been monitored
since yesterday. We'll leave together.

12:33.252 --> 12:36.881
Each team will leave at 5 a.m.
for its target mission.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.266

FEDERAL POLICE, CONGONHAS AIRPORT

17:07.734 --> 17:09.111

Up to you.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.013
[Dimas] Today is a republican day.

17:36.430 --> 17:39.933
[Dimas] The Prosecutor's Office and
the Federal Police are here together...

17:40.684 --> 17:43.604
<i>...to state that the republic</i>
<i>is blind to fame and fortune.</i>

17:45.481 --> 17:46.315
[Vander] Have fun.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.150
[Dimas] <i>Everyone is equal.</i>

17:48.609 --> 17:50.360
[Vander sighs]

17:50.444 --> 17:54.990
[Dimas] And anyone who commits a crime
must answer for it.

17:55.074 --> 18:00.704
The contractors who formed the cartel
have around R$ 60 billion

18:00.788 --> 18:03.916
in business deals with Petrobrasil.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.919
[Verena] It's important to remember
that today's operation

18:07.002 --> 18:10.964
wasn't based solely on the information
provided to us by JPR and Ibrahim.

18:11.048 --> 18:15.260
New material and testimonial evidence
supported the Prosecutor's Office charge.

18:15.344 --> 18:19.223
[Cláudio] It has been made clear
that the contractors signed deals

18:19.306 --> 18:23.393
with shell companies
that simulated consulting services,

18:23.477 --> 18:27.064
and false invoices were issued
to justify the deposits.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.858
Between 2009 and 2013,

18:29.942 --> 18:33.445
we identified deposits
amounting to more than R$ 500 million.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.781
And we expect this number to grow.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.408
[camera shutters and flashes]

18:38.492 --> 18:40.285
[Vander] We won't have beds for everyone.

18:41.078 --> 18:42.788
[Vander] Settle it among yourselves.

18:42.871 --> 18:45.082

18:45.165 --> 18:46.333

Yes.

He didn't talk to me.

19:18.448 --> 19:19.533
Weird.

19:19.700 --> 19:21.577
You guys need to talk, Verena.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.661
What do you mean?

19:23.745 --> 19:25.622
-Tell me!
-It's between you two.

[Ricardo Bretch] I'm tired of saying it.

[Bretch] And I want to see you all
doing it right now.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.385
[Bretch] How long before they talk?

21:02.135 --> 21:04.429
[Bretch] They can figure it out!
That's their problem.

21:04.513 --> 21:06.014
[Bretch] I'm not lifting a finger.

21:06.974 --> 21:07.808
[Bretch] Morning.

21:07.891 --> 21:09.101
-Morning.
-[Bretch] What's up?

21:09.184 --> 21:11.061
Here are those who accepted your offer.

21:11.144 --> 21:13.563
-[Bretch] What offer?
-The offer to relocate abroad.

21:14.648 --> 21:16.566
Fourteen, Maria Tereza?

21:16.650 --> 21:18.235
That's the entire department.

-[Maria Tereza] I'm not going.
-Good to know, but I need more help.

21:21.196 --> 21:22.990
-Contact Krug.
-Krug?

21:23.073 --> 21:25.617
Krug, Ms. Maria Tereza.
Set up a meeting at my place.

21:25.701 --> 21:27.744
-And buy the tickets.
-What tickets?

21:27.828 --> 21:29.538
For those who decided to leave.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.956
But they've already left.

21:31.039 --> 21:32.874
-Who authorized that?
-You, sir.

21:33.875 --> 21:34.876
Call Krug.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.882
[Verena] There's nothing here!

21:40.966 --> 21:43.093
I brought what I could
from Miller &amp; Bretch.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.679
I cleaned the place out.

21:45.762 --> 21:48.307
That's impossible!
What is Ricardo Bretch's secret?

21:48.390 --> 21:51.476
Someone has to talk.
I don't know, an employee, a director.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.062
[Verena] Guilhome,
let's focus on the executives.

21:54.187 --> 21:56.606
[Verena] I want to know how many
and which departments.

21:56.690 --> 21:59.526
Get me an organizational chart
of Miller &amp; Bretch, please.

21:59.609 --> 22:00.902
Who does what in there.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.780
Someone must know
where this money is going.

22:05.240 --> 22:06.700
[she sighs]

22:16.168 --> 22:19.254
It's still a mystery
how Bretch reinjects the money.

22:20.505 --> 22:21.757
But I'll figure it out.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.259
What's your request, Deputy?

22:24.343 --> 22:26.720
The wiretapping of Ricardo Bretch.

22:29.389 --> 22:30.599
The Club had 13 members.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.601
I've only caught 12.

of the task force.

23:22.609 --> 23:23.485

23:23.568 --> 23:25.195
They're all federal agents.

23:25.278 --> 23:27.322
There are public prosecutors as well.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.033
What level of information
are you after, sir?

23:30.117 --> 23:32.035
[Bretch] Addictions, lovers, debts.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.454
[Bretch] I want to know everything.
I want it yesterday.

23:34.538 --> 23:37.749
-You're in a hurry, so I'll need a team.
-[Bretch] Whatever you need.

24:00.147 --> 24:01.148
Nothing.

24:02.065 --> 24:03.817
[Verena] Here. Stay here for a while.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.571
[Verena] What's up, Guilhome? Any news?

24:08.280 --> 24:10.323
[Guilhome] Out of the 75 executives
from Miller,

24:10.407 --> 24:13.451
fourteen left the country
a day after the operation started.

24:13.577 --> 24:15.745
-[Guilhome] They left with their families.
-What?

24:15.829 --> 24:18.623
[Guilhome] Fourteen executives left
with their wives, children, in-laws.

24:18.707 --> 24:19.791
[Verena] They fled.

24:19.875 --> 24:22.460
[Guilhome] No one would take
their in-laws on a business trip.

24:22.544 --> 24:24.379
-[Verena] Right.
-Nor on a leisure trip.

24:24.838 --> 24:29.217
I've talked with the guys in Guarulhos
and 67 people left the country

24:29.301 --> 24:31.303
one day after the operation started. 67!

24:31.386 --> 24:33.763
All 14 executives
are from the same department.

24:33.847 --> 24:37.184
[Guilhome] Precisely.
The Structured Operations department.

24:37.267 --> 24:39.769
-What does that mean?
-[Guilhome] I don't know yet.

24:39.853 --> 24:43.732
What I do know is that everyone left,
except the executive secretary.

24:45.192 --> 24:47.319
-Name?
-Maria Tereza Assunção.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.280
-São Paulo?
-[Guilhome] Yes.

24:50.363 --> 24:52.157
[Verena] Get me a ticket to São Paulo.

24:52.240 --> 24:55.827
[Verena] Let's talk to Maria Tereza
about this department...

24:55.911 --> 24:59.414
[Guilhome] The Structured Operations
department. I'll get your plane ticket.

25:00.498 --> 25:02.459

25:10.717 --> 25:11.760
[Verena] Yes, it's me.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.305
Yes, ultrasound and CAT scan.

25:18.099 --> 25:20.185
Why did they send you the results, not me?

25:22.187 --> 25:23.188
[Verena] Right.

25:27.317 --> 25:28.235
Right.

25:31.279 --> 25:34.574
I'm in the middle of a big work thing
right now. I can't just...

25:35.742 --> 25:38.370
I need to go to São Paulo.
I can't have surgery now.

25:49.923 --> 25:51.675
-[Guilhome] What happened?
-[Verena] Nothing.

25:51.758 --> 25:52.884

25:52.968 --> 25:54.803

Ten, fifteen years ago,
I was after a criminal.

27:48.958 --> 27:53.213
And right now, there's someone
doing something very wrong.

27:56.674 --> 28:01.179
It's hurting another person.
It's hurting several people.

28:01.262 --> 28:04.224
And I keep wondering
if this person knows about it.

28:06.601 --> 28:07.852
About what's being done.

28:09.813 --> 28:12.148
Or if that person's pretending
not to know.

28:15.610 --> 28:16.694
Or just doesn't care.

28:19.656 --> 28:20.949

I think they have
to take out my uterus.

28:55.942 --> 28:57.777
[Verena] And Cláudio
is with another woman.

29:00.405 --> 29:02.031
There were 13 people in the Club.

29:04.242 --> 29:05.744
But I've only caught 12.

29:07.620 --> 29:10.999

There's no end to this.

29:44.240 --> 29:45.241
It might kill us.

29:50.955 --> 29:52.207
I'm done.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.466
And I think you should stop too.

30:11.100 --> 30:12.977
[Verena] How many days in hospital?

30:13.853 --> 30:14.896
[she sobs]

30:14.979 --> 30:18.399
I don't know, I can't.
I can only take two days.

Two days maximum.

30:25.114 --> 30:26.908
You can schedule it.

30:47.178 --> 30:48.346
[Cláudio] Verena, open up!

30:51.224 --> 30:52.684
[Cláudio] Verena, what happened?

30:55.061 --> 30:58.147
I've called you a thousand times.
Did you get my message?

31:02.902 --> 31:04.070

31:27.552 --> 31:29.554
<i>That's former Deputy Ruffo.</i>

31:29.637 --> 31:32.807
A former federal deputy retired
due to mental health issues.

31:32.891 --> 31:38.563
He deals with Deputy Verena
and Agent Guilhome.

31:38.897 --> 31:42.901
Several boxes of Operation Jet Wash papers
were found in his garage.

31:42.984 --> 31:46.154
What is a former deputy
with mental health issues doing with that?

31:46.237 --> 31:47.530
[Ibrahim] Fucking it all up.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.324
[Ibrahim] Fucking it up, as usual. What's the next step?

31:52.911 --> 31:56.247
-Get the lunatic's disciple suspended.
-Any ideas how?

31:56.789 --> 31:58.833
Send these to FP Internal Affairs.

32:01.127 --> 32:02.003
Anonymous tip?

32:02.086 --> 32:03.796
[Ibrahim] They'll have to investigate.

32:04.297 --> 32:05.131
Look.

32:05.214 --> 32:08.217
Creator and creature. Ruffo's protégé.
It was bound to happen.

32:08.301 --> 32:11.721
[Bretch] Internal Affairs will handle
the disciple, who will handle the master?

32:11.804 --> 32:12.805
[Bretch] Will you?

32:14.307 --> 32:16.267
No one will miss this asshole.

32:16.684 --> 32:18.811
[treadmill switches off] [Bretch breathes heavily]

32:21.856 --> 32:23.483
With the deputy suspended,

32:23.566 --> 32:26.653
the lunatic out of the way,
my executives out of the country...

32:27.445 --> 32:28.613
...you're the only one left.

32:28.988 --> 32:31.407
-[Ibrahim] I said what I had to.
-You said too much.

32:34.702 --> 32:36.245
I was pressured.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.330
That's the problem.

32:39.499 --> 32:42.085
[Bretch] Resisting pressure,
how much can one take?

32:42.168 --> 32:44.921
-You don't need to worry about me.
-[Bretch] Only time will tell.

33:05.191 --> 33:08.152
Internal Affairs have asked me
to suspend you and Guilhome.

33:08.611 --> 33:09.946
To investigate you.

33:11.406 --> 33:13.950
[Roberval] Verena, how did
those archives end up with Ruffo?

33:16.828 --> 33:20.039
The Federal Police punishes
those who seek the truth.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.083
It punishes those who break the law...

33:22.166 --> 33:25.294
You'd have to be born again
to understand people like me and him.

33:26.629 --> 33:27.922
Excuse me.

33:54.449 --> 33:56.284
[he kisses her]

34:29.150 --> 34:31.652
[Vander sighs]

34:50.045 --> 34:52.172
[Verena cries]

35:08.898 --> 35:11.359
Things have cooled down,
but they could heat up again.

35:11.442 --> 35:12.652
PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE

35:12.735 --> 35:16.405
The important thing now is to replace
the Attorney General to assure...

35:16.489 --> 35:18.491
[Janete] I can't do that! Very well. Keep him if you want.

35:20.660 --> 35:23.579
But he'll need to change
the Federal Police Chief.

35:26.082 --> 35:27.083
I can't.

35:28.501 --> 35:31.254
-It's just too obvious.
-Obvious!

35:31.337 --> 35:34.632
Of course it is!
But leaving things as they are

35:34.715 --> 35:37.885
will cost you much more
than this temporary embarrassment.

35:40.888 --> 35:43.432
Janete, listen to me
for once in your life.

35:47.895 --> 35:50.857
[Lemes] Curitiba
is practically neutralized.

35:51.399 --> 35:52.400
That's what we hope.

35:52.483 --> 35:55.444
[Lemes] The most dangerous core
of the Federal Police got thrown out.

35:55.528 --> 35:57.029
Why did it take so long?

35:57.113 --> 36:00.449
They only got thrown out because
Ricardo Bretch pulled some strings.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.660
-It wasn't her.
-She doesn't listen to me.

36:02.785 --> 36:05.079
She doesn't understand
that if she doesn't stop...

36:05.163 --> 36:07.790
She won't stop. She won't.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.836
And if she doesn't stop,
we'll need to stop her.

36:11.919 --> 36:13.754
It's not a difficult thing to do.

36:14.213 --> 36:15.715
We need to lure Penha in.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.551
We'll get Penha, no problem.

36:18.634 --> 36:20.136
And Penha gets everyone else.

36:20.219 --> 36:22.013
The media will help.

36:22.305 --> 36:26.100
-Warn your friend at <i>LEIA </i> magazine.
<i>-LEIA </i> is already with us.

36:26.767 --> 36:30.313
But to do that now,
we need the entire media.

36:30.396 --> 36:32.773
Radio, TV, newspapers.

36:32.857 --> 36:35.359
We've got to sell the idea
that they are the problem.

36:35.443 --> 36:36.444
[Lemes] Fine by me. You OK with this?

36:39.697 --> 36:41.657
It's what a vice-president must do.

36:42.575 --> 36:44.118
[they clink glasses]

37:09.268 --> 37:10.686
[Verena] Did you come to propose?

37:10.770 --> 37:11.896
[Ruffo laughs]

37:13.814 --> 37:14.649
[Ruffo] Yes.

37:25.451 --> 37:28.162
-Did they give you that drug?
-[Verena] What drug?

37:28.454 --> 37:32.583
That one that makes you drowsy
and puts you to sleep.

37:32.959 --> 37:36.462
[Verena] No. I like the one
they give you after that.

37:36.545 --> 37:38.881
You like the one that wakes you up, right?

37:38.965 --> 37:39.924
[Verena laughs]

37:41.259 --> 37:44.887
I looked up the doctor. The guy's good!

37:45.513 --> 37:46.931
It's going to be fine.

37:50.351 --> 37:52.853
I never really had
that maternal instinct anyway.

38:00.319 --> 38:01.320
Ruffo...

38:02.655 --> 38:04.365
Silvério's plea bargain...

38:06.200 --> 38:07.368
It was you?

38:08.953 --> 38:10.329
If I must confess...

38:10.413 --> 38:12.373
[Verena] And that
<i>Diário Paulistano </i> article? That leak...

38:15.376 --> 38:16.711
-Was it you?
-[Ruffo] Yes.

38:16.794 --> 38:17.712
[Verena laughs]

38:17.795 --> 38:21.299
I didn't do it because you couldn't
do it yourself, you know that.

38:21.382 --> 38:23.426
No. You did it because
you can't keep away.

38:23.509 --> 38:24.510
[Ruffo] Right.

38:28.389 --> 38:29.598
They suspended me.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.645
-What do you mean?
-[Verena] Someone was following me.

38:35.938 --> 38:40.151
There are pictures of me at your house,
of the documents in your garage.

38:40.234 --> 38:42.611
They're doing to you
exactly what they did to me.

38:43.612 --> 38:45.406
They can suspend me, Ruffo.

38:45.865 --> 38:46.949
But I can disagree.

38:47.908 --> 38:48.784
I know.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.498
Can you do something for me?

38:54.582 --> 38:56.334
-[Ruffo] Verena...
-No, listen to me.

38:56.417 --> 38:59.420
There's a secretary
at Miller &amp; Bretch, Maria Tereza.

38:59.503 --> 39:00.504
No, I've quit.

39:03.591 --> 39:04.633
I've quit.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.636
This is a mechanism, something...

39:09.889 --> 39:14.060
-An unstoppable turning of gears.
-[Verena] Yes, but we can't let it go on.

39:14.393 --> 39:16.771
Ruffo, they are 13. I caught 12.

39:16.854 --> 39:18.814
There's one left. The biggest one.

39:18.898 --> 39:21.692
We don't give up. We help each other.
That's what we do.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.319
Rest up.

39:24.487 --> 39:25.363
Rest up.

39:26.906 --> 39:28.532
This surgery will be OK.

39:30.159 --> 39:31.660
You will get out of here.

39:31.744 --> 39:32.828
You'll be fine.

39:34.080 --> 39:35.456
Because you rock.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.085
[Ruffo] I'm very proud of you.

39:42.463 --> 39:44.256
[Ruffo] We'll talk when you get out.

39:50.137 --> 39:51.597
[he kisses her]

39:57.728 --> 39:58.771
Ruffo.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.983
You can let go of the mechanism...

40:04.735 --> 40:07.029
...but the mechanism won't let go of you.

40:29.385 --> 40:31.720
[footsteps running]

40:34.181 --> 40:35.808
[Cláudio sighs]

40:38.978 --> 40:40.146
[Ruffo] Asshole!

40:45.818 --> 40:48.320
[monitor machine beeps]

41:00.249 --> 41:02.460
[he sighs]

41:05.588 --> 41:07.339
[he unlocks the door]

41:16.891 --> 41:19.560
I was just telling Regina
that Beta is looking great.

41:19.935 --> 41:22.229
She looks just like Mrs. Julieta,
her grandma.

41:36.076 --> 41:37.036
[Ruffo] Yeah.

41:38.287 --> 41:41.499
She looks just like her grandma.
Unbelievable.

41:59.058 --> 42:00.809
What are you doing in my home?

42:02.144 --> 42:03.562
Common interests.

42:06.982 --> 42:07.900
[Ruffo] Such as?

42:09.485 --> 42:12.613
Such as a person who is afraid of you.

42:14.615 --> 42:15.783
And of me, as well.

42:21.830 --> 42:23.165
-[Ruffo] Who?
-[Regina] Marco!

42:23.249 --> 42:24.583
-[Ruffo] Who?
-[Regina] Marco!

42:24.667 --> 42:26.544
-[Beta] Dad!
-[Ruffo] Who?

42:26.627 --> 42:29.505
-[Ibrahim] Ricardo Bretch.
-[Beta] Dad! Stop!

42:29.588 --> 42:31.298
[Ibrahim] You're scaring the girl.

42:35.302 --> 42:36.303
You scared the girl.

42:39.682 --> 42:41.517
[Ruffo] I'm going to arrest both of you.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.771
That is not going to happen.

42:47.147 --> 42:48.983
I mean, you can kill me...

42:49.567 --> 42:50.859
...but you won't arrest me.

42:53.612 --> 42:55.906
I can help you get Bretch.

42:56.365 --> 42:57.825
I don't need your help.

43:00.411 --> 43:01.912
I'll give you Bretch.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.040
And you forget about me.

43:07.042 --> 43:08.669
I get rid of both of you.

43:11.505 --> 43:13.215
I don't make deals with criminals.

43:16.427 --> 43:18.804
That's rather close-minded.

43:20.139 --> 43:21.390
In Brazil, nowadays...

43:24.393 --> 43:25.352
Ruffo...

43:25.978 --> 43:28.188
...Ricardo Bretch is way bigger than me.

43:29.648 --> 43:30.649
I'm just...

43:31.483 --> 43:33.152
I'm just a retailer.

43:33.444 --> 43:35.946
One steals a lot, the other a little.

43:36.947 --> 43:38.240
Both steal.

43:39.908 --> 43:41.869
They're both criminals in my book.

43:43.954 --> 43:45.372
That's debatable.

43:47.541 --> 43:49.043
But it's simple.

43:49.835 --> 43:51.920
You won't get Bretch without my help.

43:54.048 --> 43:56.467
If there's no deal, he'll get away.

43:58.344 --> 44:01.263
And I don't know
if that's a good thing for you.

44:03.766 --> 44:04.767
I'd say not.

44:07.478 --> 44:09.021
I'm going to arrest both of you.

44:10.773 --> 44:12.024
You and Bretch.

44:13.609 --> 44:16.278
You're going to share a fucking cell.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.282
[Ibrahim laughs] [footsteps approach]

44:22.743 --> 44:24.078
-He didn't stop?
-Get out.

44:25.204 --> 44:26.497
-[Ibrahim] He promised?
-Out.

44:28.165 --> 44:29.166
Regina...

44:31.752 --> 44:34.463
[Ibrahim inhales and exhales loudly]

44:35.756 --> 44:37.091
[Ibrahim] Give Beta a kiss.

44:39.385 --> 44:40.594
[Ibrahim] She's gorgeous.

44:48.977 --> 44:53.273
[Ruffo sighs deeply]

45:02.533 --> 45:05.119
[footsteps move away]

45:10.082 --> 45:15.337
[Ruffo breathes deeply and slowly]

45:16.755 --> 45:20.259
[Ruffo breathes deeply and slowly]

MILLER &amp; BRETCH
ORGANIZATIONAL CHART 2014

45:42.865 --> 45:44.700
[Ruffo] <i>The mechanism is a cancer, Regina.</i>

45:46.034 --> 45:47.619
[Ruffo] <i>It's a human meat-grinder.</i>

45:49.037 --> 45:52.583
[Ruffo] <i>It has no soul,</i>
<i>no limit and no ideology.</i>

45:55.419 --> 45:57.379
[Ruffo] <i>We struggle to survive...</i>

45:58.589 --> 46:01.133
<i>...and it adds insult to injury.</i>

46:02.509 --> 46:04.178
[Ruffo] <i>It laughs to our faces.</i>

46:05.345 --> 46:07.139
[Ruffo] <i>It humiliates us.</i>

46:12.144 --> 46:14.980
[Ruffo] <i>Sometimes,</i>
<i>I think all this effort is in vain.</i>

46:15.981 --> 46:18.400
[Ruffo] <i>That it'll lead to nothing.</i>

46:24.239 --> 46:26.366
[Ruffo] <i>I am not able to quit, Regina.</i>

46:27.201 --> 46:28.827
[Ruffo] <i>I'll keep on fighting,</i>

46:28.911 --> 46:31.079
<i>even if it means losing you.</i>

46:32.748 --> 46:34.249
[Ruffo] <i>I promise I'll come back.</i>

46:35.792 --> 46:37.461
[Ruffo] <i>Wait for me, if you can.</i>

46:40.464 --> 46:41.548
[Ruffo] <i>If you can't...</i>

46:44.092 --> 46:45.802
<i>...don't forget I love you.</i>

46:50.724 --> 46:53.227
[he rings doorbell]

46:53.852 --> 46:55.604
[door opens]

46:58.941 --> 47:01.026
-[doorman] Good evening.
-[Ruffo] Good evening.

47:03.737 --> 47:06.573
[indistinct voices in the background]

47:14.039 --> 47:16.041
[dull thud]

47:25.259 --> 47:26.677
[beep then buzzing noise]

47:26.760 --> 47:28.762
[door opens] [bingo caller] Mark it on your cards.

47:35.978 --> 47:40.065
I'm sure a lot of people will
take a little cash home.

47:40.148 --> 47:43.277
Another number. A lucky number!

47:43.485 --> 47:49.116
Mark it on your cards. Number 66.

47:49.199 --> 47:50.158
Mark it.

47:50.242 --> 47:54.496
Mark it horizontally, vertically.

47:54.997 --> 47:59.042
Mark your lucky number.
Another number...

47:59.126 --> 48:01.461
-[woman] Did you call number 31?
-Not yet, ma'am.

48:02.379 --> 48:05.215
[bingo caller] But mark it away
because your lucky number will come!

48:05.465 --> 48:10.304
[fading away] Another one came out!
75! 7-5!

48:10.387 --> 48:11.972
[fading] Mark it on your cards.

48:12.055 --> 48:15.183
[people cheering]

48:16.518 --> 48:19.396
[bingo caller] Mark it horizontally,
vertically.

48:19.479 --> 48:22.149
Another number is coming up.

48:23.525 --> 48:25.444
Number 13!

48:34.202 --> 48:35.746
[bingo caller] Anyone got it yet?

48:35.829 --> 48:38.165
And one more.

48:38.874 --> 48:41.835
Someone will be taking this money home.

48:42.544 --> 48:45.255
[Ruffo] Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

48:45.339 --> 48:47.883
-No, be my guest.
-[Ruffo] Thank you.

48:47.966 --> 48:49.468
[bingo caller] Two, seven!

48:49.551 --> 48:50.969
[Ruffo sighs]

48:57.351 --> 48:58.435
[Ruffo] What's your name?

49:01.146 --> 49:03.815
Maria Tereza. And yours?

49:05.817 --> 49:07.778
Nice to meet you. Marco Ruffo.
