NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.204 --> 00:06.774
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.807 --> 00:09.210
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.243 --> 00:11.212
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.245 --> 00:12.546
are members of an elite squad

00:12.580 --> 00:14.382
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.415 --> 00:17.085
These are their stories.

00:17.818 --> 00:19.187
You understand,

00:19.220 --> 00:20.688
there's no wiggle
room on the price.

00:20.721 --> 00:24.325
Well, I'd like to see it
before we talk numbers.

00:24.358 --> 00:25.593
A brownstone like this

00:25.626 --> 00:27.661
won't stay on
the market for long.

00:27.695 --> 00:29.763
What happened here?

00:31.732 --> 00:32.700
Oh, God.

00:32.733 --> 00:35.403
Donna! Call
for help.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.073
I-I need the police.

00:39.107 --> 00:40.241
Two people are dead.

00:40.274 --> 00:41.709
( gasps )

00:41.742 --> 00:43.811
H-Help me.

00:43.844 --> 00:44.845
O'HALLORAN:
Dead lady's

00:44.878 --> 00:46.247
Donna Brooks, 70.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.217
No sign of forced entry,
no security cameras.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.718
Raped and strangled.

00:50.751 --> 00:53.087
Lumalite showed traces of semen.

00:53.121 --> 00:55.789
Okay. Dispatch said
that you had a live one.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.125
Old guy's Richard Sutton.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.459
EMS is treating him out there.

00:58.492 --> 00:59.660
Don't know why
he was here.

00:59.693 --> 01:00.694
What happened to him?

01:00.728 --> 01:01.862
Possible heart attack.

01:01.895 --> 01:02.830
Marks, bruises?

01:02.863 --> 01:04.198
Not that we
could see.

01:04.232 --> 01:05.666
Is he stable enough to talk?

01:05.699 --> 01:07.535
Yeah, but we
got to get him
to Saint Vincent's.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.536
You can ride along.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.870
I'm Detective Stabler.

01:09.903 --> 01:11.705
Can you tell me
what happened?

01:11.739 --> 01:13.874
Donna... Donna...

01:13.907 --> 01:15.609
Now Mr. Sutton, tell
me what happened.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.278
Oh, God.

01:17.311 --> 01:18.446
I'm sorry.

01:18.479 --> 01:19.747
For what?

01:19.780 --> 01:21.115
I'm sorry.

01:21.149 --> 01:22.283
( steady beep )

01:22.316 --> 01:23.451
Mr. Sutton?

01:23.484 --> 01:24.518
We lost his pulse.

01:24.552 --> 01:25.753
What we got, another
heart attack?

01:25.786 --> 01:27.121
He's in V-fib.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.256
You know CPR?

01:28.289 --> 01:29.623
Yeah.

01:29.657 --> 01:31.259
Start chest compressions.
Grab the paddles.

01:31.292 --> 01:32.760
Did he say anything else
to you two inside?

01:32.793 --> 01:34.728
Just that his chest
was killing him. Back away.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.564
Clear.

01:36.597 --> 01:37.798
Still in V-fib.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.267
I'll shock him again.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.502
( siren blaring )

01:41.535 --> 01:42.770
Clear.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.238
( beeping )

01:44.272 --> 01:46.840
I got a rhythm
and a pulse.

01:46.874 --> 01:48.476
Let's move.

01:50.311 --> 01:51.545
What the hell happened?

01:51.579 --> 01:52.880
Okay, let's
get him in.

01:52.913 --> 01:54.382
Heart attack.

01:54.415 --> 01:56.384
Is that the victim?

01:56.417 --> 01:58.519
No. More like the perp.

02:01.755 --> 02:05.826
Captioning sponsored by
UNIVERSAL NETWORK TELEVISION

02:05.859 --> 02:08.762
and NBC

02:48.269 --> 02:49.737
Richard Sutton
is still unconscious.

02:49.770 --> 02:50.904
He's in cardiac
intensive care.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.573
Lives alone
on the Upper East Side.

02:52.606 --> 02:53.641
Neighbors say
he keeps to himself.

02:53.674 --> 02:55.943
What's he doing
hanging around
with the Queen

02:55.976 --> 02:56.644
of the charity balls?

02:56.677 --> 02:58.379
Well, he's a good-looking guy.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.780
Donna Brooks is a wealthy widow.

02:59.813 --> 03:00.914
Maybe he's her boyfriend.

03:00.948 --> 03:02.883
So this could be
a domestic dispute?

03:02.916 --> 03:03.951
Well, makes sense.

03:03.984 --> 03:06.454
There's no obvious signs
of robbery or forced entry.

03:06.487 --> 03:08.756
Donna and Richard
have sex, they argue,

03:08.789 --> 03:10.391
it gets violent,
he murders her,

03:10.424 --> 03:11.792
and then has
a heart attack

03:11.825 --> 03:13.661
from all the
excitement?

03:13.694 --> 03:15.863
Or he finds her dead body,
then has a heart attack.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.632
The victim's family should know
if she and Sutton were involved.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.000
BENSON:
Her daughter Joset

03:20.033 --> 03:22.503
is on her way in
right now from Jersey.

03:22.536 --> 03:24.004
The marks
on her neck are distinctive.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.406
Did you find the ligature?

03:25.439 --> 03:26.840
No. CSU's checking
for all possibles

03:26.874 --> 03:28.242
in the victim's house--
lamp cords,

03:28.276 --> 03:29.243
belts, drapery pulls.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.244
Warner give us

03:30.278 --> 03:31.245
a time of death?

03:31.279 --> 03:32.646
Based on rigor
and body temp,

03:32.680 --> 03:34.014
she puts it at 10:00 last night.

03:34.047 --> 03:35.783
Okay. Keep on CSU
for the ligature report.

03:35.816 --> 03:37.485
Captain...
MAN:
Right this way.

03:38.786 --> 03:39.753
Excuse me.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.356
I'm, uh, here about my mother,
Donna Brooks.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.392
STABLER:
Why was your mother

03:44.425 --> 03:45.893
selling her brownstone?

03:45.926 --> 03:48.396
Because I forced her to.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.533
She liked her independence,
but I wanted her

03:52.566 --> 03:55.569
to spend the time she had left
with me and her grandkids.

03:55.603 --> 03:56.870
She was sick.

03:56.904 --> 03:57.938
Lymphoma.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.940
She had less
than a year.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.875
When was the last time
you spoke with her?

04:01.909 --> 04:03.477
( sobbing ):
I called her this morning.

04:03.511 --> 04:06.580
But I got the machine.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.982
I just figured
she was exercising.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.984
She was that strong?

04:11.018 --> 04:12.886
She worked out
every morning at 5:00.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.055
She said she...

04:15.088 --> 04:17.057
she wanted to stay fit,

04:17.090 --> 04:19.727
because there was a lot
of competition for a good man.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.762
Your mom dated a lot?

04:21.795 --> 04:24.632
This is just so embarrassing.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.300
So, your mother was

04:26.334 --> 04:27.701
sexually active?

04:27.735 --> 04:29.903
With all sorts of men.

04:29.937 --> 04:32.039
She ever mention the name
Richard Sutton?

04:32.072 --> 04:33.374
No,

04:33.407 --> 04:34.675
I've never heard of him,

04:34.708 --> 04:36.410
but that doesn't mean anything.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.648
I told her to be more careful.

04:40.681 --> 04:43.617
BENSON:
Was there anyone special?

04:43.651 --> 04:45.919
Harvey Cohen.

04:45.953 --> 04:48.656
He was an instructor
at Hot to Trot.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.724
He taught her how to tango.

04:50.758 --> 04:53.026
BENSON:
Excuse me, can you tell me

04:53.060 --> 04:54.061
which one Harvey Cohen is?

04:54.094 --> 04:55.696
He's right there.

04:55.729 --> 04:56.997
Right there. Thank you.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.399
Harvey Cohen?

04:58.432 --> 04:59.567
Yes.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.734
Mind if
I cut in?

05:00.768 --> 05:01.835
Phil, take over,
will you?

05:01.869 --> 05:03.437
I could never refuse
a beautiful lady.

05:03.471 --> 05:04.972
Good. Then you won't
mind telling me

05:05.005 --> 05:06.507
if Donna Brooks was
here last night.

05:06.540 --> 05:07.708
Why don't we
step over here?

05:07.741 --> 05:09.977
She's here every Monday.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.111
You tell me
what this is about.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.746
Just have a couple
of questions.

05:12.780 --> 05:13.981
How well did
you know Donna?

05:14.014 --> 05:14.782
We're partners.

05:14.815 --> 05:16.684
We have a standing date
after class.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.118
Oh. So you were
having an affair?

05:18.151 --> 05:19.853
Oh, shame on you, Detective.

05:19.887 --> 05:20.888
A gentleman doesn't kiss
and tell.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.524
A gentleman doesn't rape
and murder his girlfriend.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.092
What the hell
are you talking about?

05:25.125 --> 05:26.960
Donna Brooks--
she was murdered last night.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.362
Oh, my God.

05:28.396 --> 05:29.797
What, you don't think
I killed her.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.699
You just admitted to
having a date with her.

05:31.732 --> 05:32.866
Well, I canceled.

05:32.900 --> 05:34.034
Why?

05:34.067 --> 05:35.836
Well, she was flirting
with another man

05:35.869 --> 05:37.004
during class, in
front of everyone.

05:37.037 --> 05:38.038
What did you do about that?

05:38.071 --> 05:39.039
I told her to take

05:39.072 --> 05:41.141
her boy toy and get out.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.876
This boy toy have a name?

05:42.910 --> 05:44.044
Ben Pawler.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.613
Young enough to be her son.

05:45.646 --> 05:47.815
MAN:
Donna and I left class
together.

05:47.848 --> 05:49.483
Went back to her place.

05:49.517 --> 05:51.051
What's the big deal?

05:52.520 --> 05:54.354
I'd say about
a 40-year age
difference.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.056
You should try it.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.091
Older women--
they have more experience.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.092
They're less inhibited.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.060
And you don't have to worry

06:00.093 --> 06:01.595
about getting them knocked up.

06:01.629 --> 06:02.830
BENSON:
You forgot to mention

06:02.863 --> 06:04.164
financially
independent.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.599
Donna has a
lot of dough.

06:05.633 --> 06:06.834
Definitely sweetens the pot.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.101
STABLER:
Had a lot of dough,

06:08.135 --> 06:09.437
ass-wipe.

06:09.470 --> 06:11.905
Donna was murdered last night.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.943
She was fine
when I left her.

06:15.976 --> 06:18.779
No, I take that back.

06:18.812 --> 06:21.014
She was satisfied.

06:22.616 --> 06:24.918
Yeah? What time was that, Romeo?

06:24.952 --> 06:26.086
9:15.

06:26.119 --> 06:27.755
Can anyone back up that story?

06:28.789 --> 06:30.758
Marion?

06:30.791 --> 06:32.025
( door opening )

06:32.059 --> 06:33.994
I picked Ben up from Donna's

06:34.027 --> 06:35.463
at 9:15, Detectives.

06:39.099 --> 06:41.101
BENSON:
Benny, Harvey, Sutton.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.503
Donna got around.

06:42.536 --> 06:44.104
Guess she was trying
to pack a lot of living

06:44.137 --> 06:45.506
into the days she had left.

06:45.539 --> 06:47.107
Well, she should've
had better taste in men.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.176
I got an update
on Richard Sutton.

06:49.209 --> 06:52.045
Doc says he's still intubated,
nobody can see him.

06:52.079 --> 06:55.048
But I did some digging.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.117
Turns out
Mr. Sutton had four wives.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.151
All four
still alive?

06:58.185 --> 06:59.920
First three died
of natural causes.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.455
Last Mrs. Sutton is still
with us.

07:01.489 --> 07:02.623
She's so sweet.

07:02.656 --> 07:03.891
And loaded.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.493
He knows how to pick 'em--
old and rich.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.560
Yeah, but he doesn't know

07:06.594 --> 07:07.661
how to treat them.

07:07.695 --> 07:09.096
The most recent Mrs. Sutton
filed a 61

07:09.129 --> 07:10.030
for domestic violence last year.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.732
BENSON:
And they didn't
lock him up?

07:11.765 --> 07:13.734
She conveniently
dropped the complaint.

07:13.767 --> 07:14.902
Where is she now?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.470
Social Security checks go

07:16.504 --> 07:17.638
to an address in Queens.

07:20.741 --> 07:23.076
BENSON:
Alexis, I wanted to ask you

07:23.110 --> 07:24.144
about Richard.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.514
Who?

07:26.547 --> 07:27.848
Your husband?

07:27.881 --> 07:29.550
Marty was
my husband.

07:29.583 --> 07:32.152
My one true love.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.855
He died in Korea.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.857
I have his medals.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.526
MAN:
Sorry, Detectives,
I got held up.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.160
Your message said
you wanted to talk

07:40.193 --> 07:41.128
about Richard Sutton.

07:41.161 --> 07:45.032
Not Richard.
Marty. Marty.

07:45.065 --> 07:47.234
President Truman sent me
a telegram.

07:48.602 --> 07:49.737
Alzheimer's?

07:49.770 --> 07:51.905
Progressing rapidly.

07:51.939 --> 07:54.174
No offense, Mr. Ridley,
but we heard she had money.

07:54.207 --> 07:55.876
What is she doing
in a place like this?

07:55.909 --> 07:57.244
Oh, she did,

07:57.277 --> 07:59.079
until that snake Sutton
got hold of it.

07:59.112 --> 08:00.213
He married her,

08:00.247 --> 08:01.682
and then he dumped
her in here,

08:01.715 --> 08:03.150
so he could live like a king.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.752
Now, does he ever come
and visit her?

08:04.785 --> 08:07.054
Only when he needs
her signature.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.189
She is obviously
in no...

08:09.222 --> 08:10.691
I want that
cracker.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.092
...condition to
sign anything.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.260
I filed a complaint,

08:13.293 --> 08:14.261
but nothing happened.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.195
Husband has the right to do

08:15.228 --> 08:16.797
what he wants with the money.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.532
BENSON:
Including romancing
other women?

08:18.566 --> 08:20.067
If you call
slapping around women romantic.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.234
He hit her?

08:21.268 --> 08:22.903
After Sutton's last visit,

08:22.936 --> 08:25.038
I found her lying on the floor,
all bruised up.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.239
BENSON:
Did you report it?

08:26.273 --> 08:28.008
I didn't see him do it,

08:28.041 --> 08:31.545
and Alexis said
she must've fallen out of bed.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.547
This time
Sutton is going

08:33.581 --> 08:35.583
to answer
my questions.

08:37.585 --> 08:39.186
STABLER:
We found your
wife, Mr. Sutton,

08:39.219 --> 08:40.220
the one you
stashed away

08:40.253 --> 08:41.288
at that dump
in Queens.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.156
You want to
talk about her?

08:43.190 --> 08:44.057
I'm not surprised.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.927
Why don't we talk
about Donna Brooks then?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.596
BENSON:
Is she your next target,
Mr. Sutton?

08:48.629 --> 08:49.630
What, did she reject you?

08:49.663 --> 08:50.698
Is that why you raped

08:50.731 --> 08:51.699
and killed her?

08:51.732 --> 08:52.800
( groans )

08:52.833 --> 08:54.134
How did you get into the house?

08:56.336 --> 08:58.238
Write your answer down.

09:02.643 --> 09:03.611
The house
was open?

09:03.644 --> 09:04.945
What time were you there?

09:06.079 --> 09:07.848
STABLER:
You were there

09:07.881 --> 09:09.249
at 9:00 a.m. this morning?

09:09.282 --> 09:11.151
Where were you
at 10:00 last night?

09:13.721 --> 09:15.723
"Home...

09:15.756 --> 09:17.090
alone."

09:17.124 --> 09:18.726
So, you have no alibi
for when she was killed?

09:26.967 --> 09:28.936
STABLER:
"Not killed last night."

09:28.969 --> 09:30.671
How do you know that?

09:30.704 --> 09:32.606
"Donna exercises

09:32.640 --> 09:35.876
"a.m.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.978
"Windows...

09:38.011 --> 09:41.314
always... open."

09:41.348 --> 09:43.651
Did you shut them?

09:50.658 --> 09:52.860
"Freezing."

09:54.427 --> 09:56.630
You turned up the heat?

09:56.664 --> 09:57.264
( softly groans )

09:57.297 --> 09:58.866
WARNER:
Postmortem

09:58.899 --> 10:00.934
body temp decreases
roughly one degree per hour

10:00.968 --> 10:02.235
at average room temperature.

10:02.269 --> 10:03.370
What was Donna's body temp

10:03.403 --> 10:04.972
when the real estate agent
found her?

10:05.005 --> 10:06.173
About 86 degrees,

10:06.206 --> 10:07.808
which is 12 degrees
below normal.

10:07.841 --> 10:09.743
That puts time of
death at 10:00 p.m.,

10:09.777 --> 10:10.944
12 hours earlier.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.312
Problem is, I
didn't account

10:12.345 --> 10:14.047
for the freezing
apartment,

10:14.081 --> 10:15.816
or the fact she
was exercising.

10:15.849 --> 10:17.417
So, how does that change
your calculation?

10:17.450 --> 10:19.152
The exertion from working out

10:19.186 --> 10:21.054
depleted her
adenosine triphosphate,

10:21.088 --> 10:22.422
causing rigor
to occur faster.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.893
So the exercise sped up
the rigor, and the cold caused

10:25.926 --> 10:27.661
a rapid decline in
body temperature.

10:27.695 --> 10:28.762
But what's that
add up to now?

10:28.796 --> 10:30.964
I was wrong
about the time of death.

10:30.998 --> 10:33.100
Donna was killed
early this morning.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.367
I'd say around 6:00 a.m.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.969
We have to
reinterview
all the men.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.671
We didn't get alibis
for this morning.

10:37.705 --> 10:38.806
I've got something
that might help.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.975
I didn't find fibers in the skin
of your victim's neck,

10:42.009 --> 10:44.978
but the ligature's impression
is unusual.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.114
STABLER:
Does it match anything
at the crime scene?

10:47.147 --> 10:50.183
No. The killer took
whatever he used with him.

10:50.217 --> 10:52.052
You have any
idea what it was?

10:52.085 --> 10:53.353
Sorry. But the FBI has

10:53.386 --> 10:54.755
a database.

10:54.788 --> 10:56.857
I forwarded the image
to their lab.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.258
Well, Huang works
for the Bureau.

10:58.291 --> 10:59.693
Maybe he can
expedite our search.

10:59.727 --> 11:01.028
Thanks.

11:02.763 --> 11:05.132
HUANG:
The murder weapon is a rope--

11:05.165 --> 11:06.233
a static kernmantle.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.468
It's used in rock climbing,
it's extremely strong,

11:08.501 --> 11:09.903
and it doesn't fray.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.371
Well, that's why
there were no fibers.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.706
Does VICAP have any other cases

11:12.740 --> 11:14.107
where this kind
of rope was used?

11:14.141 --> 11:15.943
I already checked,
and there's 15 matches.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.077
( beep )

11:17.110 --> 11:18.311
STABLER:
Tell you what.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.347
Let's narrow this down
by using our M.O., okay?

11:20.380 --> 11:21.882
Okay. Give me
the search parameters.

11:21.915 --> 11:22.950
BENSON:
Victim is female,

11:22.983 --> 11:24.918
age 60 to 80,

11:24.952 --> 11:26.019
strangulation
homicide.

11:26.053 --> 11:27.287
STABLER:
In her own home.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.990
In her own home.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.992
BENSON:
Wow. Two
matches.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.460
And the first one
is Susan Zelman,

11:33.493 --> 11:35.128
age 65.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.864
Killed two years ago
in Brooklyn.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.503
Second one, Claudia Wooding,

11:43.536 --> 11:46.373
70, murdered three
years ago in Piermont.

11:48.375 --> 11:49.943
BENSON
Three females
over 60,

11:49.977 --> 11:51.311
all from the
Metro area,

11:51.344 --> 11:53.981
all strangled
with this static kernmantle.

11:54.014 --> 11:56.917
We've got a serial killer
preying on the elderly.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.355
CRAGEN:
Three rich elderly women

12:02.389 --> 12:04.892
all strangled
with the same rope.

12:04.925 --> 12:05.893
STABLER:
Perp's organized.

12:05.926 --> 12:07.160
Doesn't leave a
murder weapon,

12:07.194 --> 12:08.328
no prints, no sign
of forced entry.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.530
CRAGEN:
The victims know him,
so they let him in.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.899
Or he conned 'em.

12:11.932 --> 12:13.166
Old people
make great targets.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.467
They're lonely.
They're vulnerable.

12:14.501 --> 12:15.903
Let's keep the
M.O. in-house.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.370
Last thing we
need is a copycat.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.907
What've you got?
The victims' nearest
and dearest.

12:19.940 --> 12:22.910
FIN:
Claudia Wooding's
son, Eddie Wooding.

12:22.943 --> 12:26.079
Detective on the case says
Eddie's a real schmuck.

12:26.113 --> 12:27.915
Mother disinherited
him after he lost

12:27.948 --> 12:30.283
a bundle of her
money in the market.

12:30.317 --> 12:32.552
Where's Eddie now?
He owns a fancy
car dealership.

12:32.585 --> 12:34.054
What about Susan Zelman?

12:34.087 --> 12:34.955
No suspects
in her murder.

12:34.988 --> 12:36.456
She's survived by
her husband Marvin.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.291
CRAGEN:
They look at him?

12:38.325 --> 12:40.293
He's got rheumatoid arthritis,
confined to a wheelchair.

12:40.327 --> 12:41.561
Doubt he had the strength
to strangle her.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.563
Munch, Fin, go
talk to Eddie.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.799
You two, pay a
visit to Mr. Zelman.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.268
There's got to
be a link between
these three women.

12:48.301 --> 12:50.437
Apart from being dead?

12:50.470 --> 12:52.339
MARVIN:
I'll never forgive myself

12:52.372 --> 12:53.406
for her death.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.574
Why is that,
Mr. Zelman?

12:54.607 --> 12:57.945
Because I was out
playing bridge.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.280
She didn't want to go.

13:00.313 --> 13:03.116
If I'd stayed home,
this wouldn't have happened.

13:03.150 --> 13:06.419
Mr. Zelman.

13:06.453 --> 13:09.289
Did your wife know
a Donna Brooks?

13:09.322 --> 13:12.960
No, no, and I know
all of Susan's friends.

13:12.993 --> 13:15.162
How 'bout
Claudia Wooding?

13:15.195 --> 13:17.330
Yeah, Claudia was my mother.
Why you asking?

13:17.364 --> 13:19.466
Did she know Donna Brooks
or Susan Zelman?

13:19.499 --> 13:20.433
How the hell
do I know?

13:20.467 --> 13:22.435
If you're
sniffing around,

13:22.469 --> 13:25.138
trying to reopen
my mother's murder,
save your energy.

13:25.172 --> 13:28.475
I didn't kill her.
Any idea who did?

13:28.508 --> 13:31.444
I just can't imagine
anyone hurting my Susan.

13:31.478 --> 13:34.614
Now, the police said
it was probably a drug addict

13:34.647 --> 13:35.615
looking for money.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.317
Was anything taken?

13:37.350 --> 13:38.618
Not a thing.

13:38.651 --> 13:42.322
She only had $20 in her purse,

13:42.355 --> 13:43.991
even though she had
plenty of money.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.093
Who inherited the
money after she died?

13:46.126 --> 13:47.094
EDDIE:
Not me.

13:47.127 --> 13:48.628
Bitch didn't leave me
a dime.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.463
Sounds like a fine motive
for murder.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.999
Oh, why bother?

13:52.032 --> 13:53.633
She was about to kick
the bucket anyway.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.502
Lung cancer.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.570
STABLER:
Your wife was sick?

13:57.604 --> 13:58.638
She had breast cancer...

13:58.671 --> 14:01.008
and on the very day
she was killed,

14:01.041 --> 14:03.343
the oncologist told her
she was in remission.

14:03.376 --> 14:05.645
Who was the
oncologist?

14:09.917 --> 14:11.518
STABLER:
Dr. Brelsford,
we need your help.

14:11.551 --> 14:13.220
It's about two
of your patients:

14:13.253 --> 14:15.222
Susan Zelman and
Claudia Wooding.

14:15.255 --> 14:17.357
Unfortunately, they both died
several years ago.

14:17.390 --> 14:18.391
Of cancer?

14:18.425 --> 14:21.061
I believe they were
both murdered.

14:21.094 --> 14:22.395
That's quite a coincidence.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.397
Isn't it.
What's this about?

14:24.431 --> 14:26.533
Donna Brooks.
Was she a patient of yours?

14:26.566 --> 14:29.903
No, but she was treated
at this hospital.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.571
Why are you asking
about her?

14:31.604 --> 14:33.540
She was murdered also.

14:33.573 --> 14:36.243
I assure you, if I wanted
to kill somebody,

14:36.276 --> 14:37.477
you'd never know it was murder.

14:37.510 --> 14:38.378
Yeah? How's that?

14:38.411 --> 14:40.380
Because I'd know how...
To cover it up?

14:40.413 --> 14:41.681
Is that what
you were going to say?

14:41.714 --> 14:43.483
No.
You make some
lethal house calls

14:43.516 --> 14:44.451
to rich old ladies?

14:44.484 --> 14:46.486
My patients are very grateful
for the quality

14:46.519 --> 14:47.587
of care I give them.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.457
I have no reason
to kill anybody.

14:50.490 --> 14:51.992
I'm very busy. Is that all?

14:52.025 --> 14:54.027
No. Where were you yesterday
at 6 a.m.?

14:54.061 --> 14:55.028
At home.
With who?

14:55.062 --> 14:56.163
I live by myself.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.398
STABLER:
Doctor, we have two,
possibly three dead women,

14:58.431 --> 15:01.034
all of 'em connected to you.

15:01.068 --> 15:04.004
You're going to have to do
a little better than that.

15:05.538 --> 15:08.375
Look... lots of people
are involved

15:08.408 --> 15:10.443
in the care of cancer patients.

15:10.477 --> 15:12.212
Like who?
In the hospital,

15:12.245 --> 15:13.613
there's a team
of doctors,

15:13.646 --> 15:15.382
nurses, social workers.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.517
After discharge, they often use
in-home care.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.052
STABLER:
Who provides that?

15:19.086 --> 15:21.554
I use RDH,
run by Dr. Matt Spevak.

15:21.588 --> 15:26.059
My patients wouldn't settle
for less.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.294
Dr. Spevak is in a meeting,

15:27.327 --> 15:29.062
but I'm Emma Spevak,
the Nurse Manager.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.230
Are you his wife?

15:30.263 --> 15:32.565
Sister. What can I do for you?

15:32.599 --> 15:34.234
We need to confirm
that Claudia Wooding

15:34.267 --> 15:36.303
and Susan Zelman
were clients.

15:36.336 --> 15:39.572
I'll check.

15:39.606 --> 15:41.608
Yes, they were.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.110
How 'bout Donna Brooks?

15:45.678 --> 15:47.547
Yes, she was as well.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.249
What's this about?

15:49.282 --> 15:51.084
They were
all murdered.

15:51.118 --> 15:52.452
Oh, my God.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.554
Well, please tell me what you
need, and I'll help you.

15:54.587 --> 15:56.289
Did they have a
caretaker in common?

15:56.323 --> 15:59.726
Nurse DeVaal was the primary
for all three.

15:59.759 --> 16:01.261
What's going on, Emma?

16:01.294 --> 16:02.729
This is Dr. Spevak.

16:02.762 --> 16:05.065
Doctor, I'm Detective Stabler.

16:05.098 --> 16:06.633
This is my partner,
Detective Benson.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.601
Hey.
Oh, you must be here
about Donna Brooks.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.437
I saw it on the news.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.173
BENSON:
Two other patients of yours
were also killed.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.542
Your sister says
that a Nurse DeVaal
treated all of 'em.

16:15.575 --> 16:17.644
Where can
we find her?
Him.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.579
Gary hasn't been with us
for a few weeks now.

16:19.612 --> 16:23.116
Why?
A patient accused
him of stealing.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.585
I fired him.
BENSON
Which patient?

16:25.618 --> 16:28.055
Donna Brooks.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.056
Where is Gary

16:29.089 --> 16:31.624
working now?
Meals on Wheels.

16:32.725 --> 16:34.294
( knocking )

16:34.327 --> 16:35.595
Gary DeVaal?

16:35.628 --> 16:37.297
Yeah?

16:37.330 --> 16:40.033
We'd like to
talk to you about
Donna Brooks.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.302
What about her?
Why don't we take
a ride?

16:42.335 --> 16:44.637
Oh, Gary.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.139
You brought friends.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.474
We're the police, ma'am.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.475
The police?
Yeah.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.642
Wha-What happened?

16:49.676 --> 16:51.144
Can't stay today,
Mrs. Rabinowitz.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.146
Here's your dinner.
Don't go.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.148
No one else visits me.

16:55.182 --> 16:56.783
I'll come back
tomorrow-- I promise.

16:56.816 --> 17:00.220
Shouldn't make promises
you can't keep.

17:00.253 --> 17:01.221
STABLER:
Why'd you steal

17:01.254 --> 17:02.322
from Donna Brooks?

17:02.355 --> 17:03.790
I didn't.
The bitch is lying.

17:03.823 --> 17:06.326
The bitch is
dead, Gary.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.328
I hated her,
but I didn't kill her.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.163
Why didn't you like her?
Everyone else did.

17:10.197 --> 17:13.166
Everyone else
didn't work for her.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.801
Getting fired
was the best thing

17:14.834 --> 17:16.636
that could've
happened to me.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.338
So why'd you keep
her house keys?

17:18.371 --> 17:19.572
Plan to pay
her a visit?

17:19.606 --> 17:20.607
I never got a chance

17:20.640 --> 17:22.642
to return them.
"To my dear
husband, Larry,

17:22.675 --> 17:24.177
with love,
from Donna."

17:24.211 --> 17:25.745
I guess you didn't
have a chance to return

17:25.778 --> 17:26.779
her dead husband's
watch, either, huh?

17:26.813 --> 17:29.316
She docked me 20 bucks
for being ten minutes late.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.518
You took a $10,000 Rolex!

17:31.551 --> 17:33.253
Fair trade?
That old bat

17:33.286 --> 17:34.821
gave half a mil
to feed the pigeons.

17:34.854 --> 17:36.456
She didn't need the lousy watch!

17:36.489 --> 17:38.191
You steal from
them as well?

17:38.225 --> 17:41.194
No. I'd never
rip off Susan.

17:41.228 --> 17:43.596
She was a sweetheart.

17:43.630 --> 17:46.399
Well, how 'bout Claudia Wooding?
Is she a sweetheart, too?
I've never seen her

17:46.433 --> 17:48.401
before in my life.
RDH says you
were her nurse.

17:48.435 --> 17:51.704
RDH is lying!
Someone's setting me up!

17:51.738 --> 17:53.673
Check the files!

17:53.706 --> 17:56.209
That enough to subpoena
RDH's records?

17:56.243 --> 17:57.844
Yeah, I'll get started
on the paperwork,

17:57.877 --> 17:59.712
but since DeVaal is
shouting frame job,

17:59.746 --> 18:00.847
I want the files
authenticated.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.749
Take 'em to the forensic
document examiner.

18:02.782 --> 18:04.717
We'll catch this low-life
in another lie.

18:04.751 --> 18:07.587
Keep DeVaal on ice--
I'll go check it out.

18:11.258 --> 18:13.726
I reviewed
Claudia Wooding's file.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.862
DeVaal's signature is definitely
on the nursing logs.

18:15.895 --> 18:17.397
So DeVaal is lying.

18:17.430 --> 18:18.698
Not necessarily.

18:18.731 --> 18:19.732
What do you mean?

18:19.766 --> 18:22.402
RNs have to sign off
at the end of each shift.

18:22.435 --> 18:25.738
Now, these are
Claudia Wooding's
case logs with, uh...

18:25.772 --> 18:28.408
from two different dates
with Gary DeVaal's
signature on each.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.443
Now watch this.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.213
Bam.
They're identical.

18:33.246 --> 18:34.747
Yeah, but nobody signs
their name

18:34.781 --> 18:36.749
exactly the same way
every time.

18:36.783 --> 18:38.718
We call it
a transposition forgery.

18:38.751 --> 18:40.753
So someone Xeroxed
DeVaal's signature

18:40.787 --> 18:42.755
and then cut and
pasted onto the files.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.425
Which was then copied, making
the paste job undetectable.

18:45.458 --> 18:49.729
So DeVaal was right;
he is being set up.

18:49.762 --> 18:51.464
It's got to be someone at RDH.

18:51.498 --> 18:54.734
They're the only ones with
access to the victims' files.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.604
DeVaal is a sleazeball
who got fired for theft.

18:57.637 --> 18:58.605
He's a good fall-guy.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.573
But why kill these women?

19:00.607 --> 19:01.774
Well, they're all rich.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.443
They're known for
their generosity.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.612
Maybe someone made a
profit off their deaths.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.614
You're right.
Someone made a mint.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.816
I pulled copies
of the victims' wills.

19:09.849 --> 19:12.319
Who's the lucky beneficiary?

19:12.352 --> 19:13.786
The Golden Memories Foundation.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.888
Who gets the gold?
Dr. Matt Spevak,

19:15.922 --> 19:20.293
CEO of RDH and chairman
of Golden Memories.

19:20.327 --> 19:22.929
Well... looks
like the good doctor's

19:22.962 --> 19:25.832
been killing old ladies
for their money.

19:28.368 --> 19:29.769
I didn't kill anyone.
This is outrageous.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.771
My client is a well-known,
respected physician.

19:31.804 --> 19:32.672
Well, tell me,
there, Doc,

19:32.705 --> 19:34.807
did these women die
of natural causes?

19:34.841 --> 19:37.310
Of course not...
but why would I murder them?

19:37.344 --> 19:40.280
Oh, I can think of about a
million bucks worth of reasons.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.848
Each victim left you
quite a bit of cash.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.750
By killing them, you got
your hands on it quicker.

19:43.783 --> 19:44.884
I don't inherit
their money.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.587
The bequests go to charity
for poverty-stricken seniors.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.421
Right, Golden Memories

19:48.455 --> 19:50.957
Foundation.
SPEVAK:
Golden Memories

19:50.990 --> 19:52.959
is a legitimate
nonprofit organization.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.894
Whose mission is to fleece
rich old ladies.

19:54.927 --> 19:57.330
My company's doing well.
I don't need their money.

19:57.364 --> 19:58.731
I started the foundation to give

19:58.765 --> 20:00.800
something back.
You gave three women
back to God.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.435
Does that count?

20:02.469 --> 20:04.737
Excuse me, aren't we missing
something here,

20:04.771 --> 20:06.639
like direct evidence?
Your client had access

20:06.673 --> 20:07.640
to the victims' homes

20:07.674 --> 20:10.777
and profited substantially
from their deaths.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.679
That's not probable cause
for arrest.

20:12.712 --> 20:14.347
Call us if you ever get any.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.448
Matt, let's go.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.853
Spevak's laughing at us.

20:20.887 --> 20:23.356
I'm not going to
let that bastard
get away with this.

20:23.390 --> 20:26.526
I'm not so sure
Spevak's guilty.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.995
Well, gee, Doc, do
you know something
that we don't,

20:29.028 --> 20:30.363
or are you just
extending Spevak

20:30.397 --> 20:31.864
a little professional
courtesy?

20:31.898 --> 20:34.534
I'm giving you
my professional opinion.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.703
A doctor would've covered
his tracks better.

20:36.736 --> 20:39.005
Well, what do you
call forging a
nurse's signature?

20:39.038 --> 20:40.707
What's his motive?
Money.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.874
Best motive in the world.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.543
These murders were
way too personal

20:43.576 --> 20:44.877
to have been
committed for profit.

20:44.911 --> 20:48.014
Choking the life out
of three elderly women
is a sign of rage.

20:48.047 --> 20:50.883
Or a sign that he couldn't get
his hands on their money
fast enough.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.752
Okay, hold it--
we don't know if Spevak

20:52.785 --> 20:53.886
got any of their money.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.888
Where are we on
his financials?

20:55.922 --> 20:58.558
Novak says we don't have enough
to subpoena his bank records.

20:58.591 --> 20:59.892
Golden Memories
is a nonprofit.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.894
That means that his books
are public record.

21:01.928 --> 21:03.530
Have a forensic
accountant see

21:03.563 --> 21:05.432
if Spevak's cooking 'em.

21:06.833 --> 21:09.569
Last year, Golden Memories
took in 675 grand.

21:09.602 --> 21:10.870
How much did they spend
in grants?

21:10.903 --> 21:13.406
All of it...
most which went for the care

21:13.440 --> 21:14.741
of two indigent patients:

21:14.774 --> 21:16.576
Maria Franco and
Andrea Robbins.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.578
That's a lot of
charity for two people.

21:18.611 --> 21:21.914
Yeah, especially
two dead ones.

21:21.948 --> 21:24.417
I checked
with Social Security.

21:24.451 --> 21:28.888
Maria Franco and Andrea Robbins
have been dead since '96.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.891
Spevak's been keeping
phony records and
pocketing the money.

21:31.924 --> 21:35.294
That's enough
for a search warrant.

21:37.464 --> 21:38.765
FIN:
Look at this place.

21:38.798 --> 21:39.966
Got to be at least

21:39.999 --> 21:41.534
3000 square feet.

21:41.568 --> 21:43.903
Beautiful view, fancy art,
expensive antiques...

21:43.936 --> 21:45.372
MUNCH:
All of it
unpaid for.

21:45.405 --> 21:47.073
His credit cards
are all maxed out.

21:47.106 --> 21:47.940
On what?

21:47.974 --> 21:48.941
Gambling.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.010
Every casino from
Atlantic City to Foxwoods.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.512
Answering
machine's blinking.

21:52.545 --> 21:53.980
Probably a collection
agency.

21:54.013 --> 21:54.981
( beeping )

21:55.014 --> 21:56.048
MAN:
Hey, Spevak,

21:56.082 --> 21:57.049
you're late again.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.085
You better pay up, Doc,
or we're coming over.

21:59.118 --> 22:01.554
Doesn't sound
like Master Card.

22:01.588 --> 22:03.055
Explains why he
killed the old ladies.

22:03.089 --> 22:04.090
He needs money,
fast.

22:04.123 --> 22:04.957
Look at here.

22:04.991 --> 22:07.927
When Spevak's
not killing old folks,

22:07.960 --> 22:09.061
he's climbing rocks.

22:09.095 --> 22:10.697
I'll say.

22:10.730 --> 22:11.898
( metal clinking )

22:11.931 --> 22:16.703
Webbing, harness...
belay devices.

22:16.736 --> 22:18.971
And our
murder weapon.

22:19.005 --> 22:20.072
EMMA:
Can this wait?

22:20.106 --> 22:21.107
My brother's
in a meeting

22:21.140 --> 22:22.074
with a new client.

22:22.108 --> 22:24.043
Your brother is a suspect
in three homicides.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.412
You're wrong.

22:25.445 --> 22:26.679
Matt would
never hurt anyone.

22:26.713 --> 22:27.947
Well, we have
strong proof that he did.

22:27.980 --> 22:28.948
It's a mistake.

22:28.981 --> 22:30.417
There's got
to be an explanation.

22:30.450 --> 22:31.951
I'd love to hear it.

22:34.921 --> 22:35.988
( knocks )

22:36.022 --> 22:38.024
As you can see,
we offer only

22:38.057 --> 22:39.058
the highest
standards of care.

22:39.091 --> 22:40.059
You'll be
looked after

22:40.092 --> 22:42.395
in the comfort of
your own home.

22:42.429 --> 22:43.963
Emma, you'll have
to wait.

22:43.996 --> 22:45.164
I'm in the middle
of something.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.599
I know, I'm sorry, but it's...

22:46.633 --> 22:47.634
Damn it, Emma.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.636
I told you
no interruptions.

22:49.669 --> 22:51.137
Detectives.

22:51.170 --> 22:53.105
Excuse me,

22:53.139 --> 22:54.106
I'll be right back.

22:54.140 --> 22:55.942
No, you won't.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.544
Matt Spevak, you're
under arrest for Murder

22:57.577 --> 22:58.678
in the First
Degree.

22:58.711 --> 23:00.480
This is insane--
what the hell

23:00.513 --> 23:01.714
did you tell them,
Emma?!

23:01.748 --> 23:03.450
Nothing, I swear, Matt.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.622
MAN:
How does the defendant plead?

23:09.656 --> 23:10.923
Not guilty, Your Honor.

23:10.957 --> 23:12.992
I'll hear
the People on bail.

23:13.025 --> 23:13.960
Remand.

23:13.993 --> 23:15.828
Dr. Spevak manipulated
three elderly women

23:15.862 --> 23:17.864
out of their money
and then killed them for it.

23:17.897 --> 23:19.699
The funds have
not been recovered.

23:19.732 --> 23:20.800
He's a flight risk.

23:20.833 --> 23:23.503
My client is a respected member
of the community.

23:23.536 --> 23:24.637
Save it,
Ms. Staines.

23:24.671 --> 23:25.905
Unfortunately
for the defendant,

23:25.938 --> 23:26.873
I have an 80-year-old mother.

23:26.906 --> 23:28.007
SPEVAK:
I didn't
kill anyone.

23:28.040 --> 23:29.876
Bail is set

23:29.909 --> 23:31.644
at $500,000.

23:31.678 --> 23:33.446
Come on, doc.
Let's go.

23:38.150 --> 23:39.819
He'll plead out
on the fraud, Casey.

23:39.852 --> 23:40.753
Not enough.

23:40.787 --> 23:42.489
He pleads to three
counts of Murder Two,

23:42.522 --> 23:43.956
I'll take the death
penalty off the table.

23:43.990 --> 23:44.957
EMMA:
The death penalty?

23:44.991 --> 23:46.559
My brother is innocent.

23:46.593 --> 23:47.660
Don't worry, Emma.

23:47.694 --> 23:48.961
Ms. Novak
is bluffing.

23:48.995 --> 23:49.862
She has no case.

23:49.896 --> 23:52.031
Let's post bail and
get Matt out of here.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.966
NOVAK:
Spevak's attorney
is no fool.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.234
The fraud case is solid,

23:55.267 --> 23:57.537
but the evidence
on the murders is weak.

23:57.570 --> 23:58.404
STABLER:
The Crime Lab says

23:58.437 --> 23:59.972
the rope found
in Spevak's apartment

24:00.006 --> 24:01.674
matches the pattern
on the victims' necks.

24:01.708 --> 24:03.075
Is it the actual
murder weapon?

24:03.109 --> 24:05.211
Lab didn't find any blood
or skin cells on it.

24:05.244 --> 24:06.646
Spevak wouldn't
need much rope

24:06.679 --> 24:07.647
to strangle
someone.

24:07.680 --> 24:08.648
Three feet
at most.

24:08.681 --> 24:09.649
He cuts off
a piece,

24:09.682 --> 24:10.683
he uses it,
he throws it away.

24:10.717 --> 24:12.485
But I still can't connect
him to the murders.

24:12.519 --> 24:13.853
Everything we have
is circumstantial.

24:13.886 --> 24:14.954
Okay, what
about the sister?

24:14.987 --> 24:15.955
She runs
Spevak's office,

24:15.988 --> 24:17.189
she'd have to know
about the fraud.

24:17.223 --> 24:18.658
Maybe she's the one
who forged

24:18.691 --> 24:20.092
DeVaal's signature
on the nursing logs.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.894
That would make her
a co-conspirator.

24:21.928 --> 24:24.964
So let's bring her in
for a chat.

24:24.997 --> 24:27.066
( siren wailing )

24:30.603 --> 24:31.904
Special Victims.

24:31.938 --> 24:33.239
What's going on?

24:33.272 --> 24:35.241
Gal from the nursing agency
was attacked.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.610
Looks like
she was nearly
choked to death.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.011
She conscious?

24:39.045 --> 24:39.946
Yeah. We called
for a bus,

24:39.979 --> 24:41.247
but she says
she's all right.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.149
The EMTs are
checking her out.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.621
Ms. Spevak,

24:48.655 --> 24:50.823
can you talk?

24:50.857 --> 24:51.924
Yes.

24:51.958 --> 24:54.026
Who did this to you?

24:54.060 --> 24:56.763
I don't know.

24:56.796 --> 24:58.865
I'm fine now really.

25:02.802 --> 25:04.571
Look, you need to get
to a hospital

25:04.604 --> 25:05.972
to make sure
that you're okay.

25:06.005 --> 25:06.939
Well, I'm a nurse.

25:06.973 --> 25:08.174
I can take care of this.

25:08.207 --> 25:09.542
Emma? Emma,
listen to me.

25:09.576 --> 25:10.777
This guy nearly
killed you.

25:10.810 --> 25:12.912
I can't... I can't...

25:12.945 --> 25:15.114
Was it your brother?

25:15.147 --> 25:18.084
He's been under so much stress.

25:18.117 --> 25:20.987
He said he needed some money.

25:21.020 --> 25:23.089
When I told him
I wouldn't give him any more,

25:23.122 --> 25:24.056
he freaked out.

25:24.090 --> 25:25.224
He didn't mean it.

25:25.257 --> 25:28.160
Please, don't hurt him.

25:33.232 --> 25:35.968
Looks like the
doctor's gonna split.

25:36.002 --> 25:38.004
Why don't you cut the bedrooms?

25:40.006 --> 25:41.207
Bedroom's clear.

25:41.240 --> 25:42.975
Bedroom's clear.

25:43.009 --> 25:43.976
Clear.

25:44.010 --> 25:45.111
Maybe he had a few errands

25:45.144 --> 25:46.946
to run first,
like choking his sister.

25:46.979 --> 25:48.114
Or getting cash.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.682
He's tapped out
with the loan sharks.

25:49.716 --> 25:51.183
Posting bail would have
cleaned him out.

25:51.217 --> 25:53.052
But he knows plenty
of rich old ladies.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.587
Let's see
if he called any of them.

25:54.621 --> 25:55.755
Caller ID.

25:55.788 --> 25:58.057
Someone called at 5:05 a.m.

25:58.090 --> 25:59.726
Vivian Calas.

26:01.060 --> 26:03.029
Police. Search warrant.

26:03.062 --> 26:05.598
Spevak, Police.
Show yourself.

26:05.632 --> 26:08.000
I'll get back.

26:08.034 --> 26:09.669
Clear.

26:12.138 --> 26:14.040
In the bedroom.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.580
She's dead.

26:37.063 --> 26:39.165
So is Matt Spevak.

26:47.940 --> 26:50.109
STABLER:
Sorry, Doc,
but there is your serial killer.

26:50.142 --> 26:52.912
He just picked the
wrong victim this time.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.346
So, the old lady killed him?

26:54.380 --> 26:56.816
Vivian Calas shot Spevak
in the heart.

26:56.849 --> 26:58.117
Bled out in seconds.

26:58.150 --> 27:00.086
Well, she must
have been pretty
good with a gun.

27:00.119 --> 27:00.920
SIPER:
Not that good.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.689
From the trajectory
of the bullet,

27:02.722 --> 27:04.390
I'd say she's
on the bed,

27:04.423 --> 27:07.159
pulls a gun out
of the night stand,

27:07.193 --> 27:09.361
fires once and misses,

27:09.395 --> 27:11.297
then takes
a lucky shot

27:11.330 --> 27:12.298
and hits him.

27:12.331 --> 27:13.232
Why lucky?

27:13.265 --> 27:15.101
Detectives arrived
at 9:00 this morning.

27:15.134 --> 27:17.103
Spevak's blood
had congealed.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.271
That takes at
least three hours.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.107
None of the
lights were on
when we got here.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.408
She shot him
in the dark.

27:22.441 --> 27:24.310
CSU found this jewelry
in Spevak's pockets.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.745
Vivian called
Spevak.

27:25.778 --> 27:27.179
He rushes on
over here.

27:27.213 --> 27:27.980
He uses the opportunity

27:28.014 --> 27:30.249
to rip her off
for some travel cash.

27:30.282 --> 27:31.751
BENSON:
He takes the jewelry.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.085
He's gonna
strangle her,

27:33.119 --> 27:35.121
but she has a little
surprise for him--

27:35.154 --> 27:36.989
nine-mill Lady
Smith and Wesson.

27:37.023 --> 27:38.257
STABLER:
Registered in her name.

27:38.290 --> 27:39.926
She shoots him,
dies of fright.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.460
M.E. says that the
left hand side

27:41.493 --> 27:43.129
of her body
was contracted.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.330
Uh, cause of death
was a stroke.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.232
HUANG:
I don't see any
medications here

27:46.265 --> 27:47.399
for hypertension
or blood thinners.

27:47.433 --> 27:48.267
She doesn't look like

27:48.300 --> 27:50.069
she has any risk factors
for a stroke.

27:50.102 --> 27:51.237
STABLER:
She's an 80-year-old

27:51.270 --> 27:52.438
woman with a man
in her bedroom

27:52.471 --> 27:53.840
trying to kill her.

27:53.873 --> 27:55.742
He scared her to death.

27:55.775 --> 27:58.110
Well, if she's so scared,
then how'd she get a shot off

27:58.144 --> 28:00.112
in the dark
that hit him right in the heart?

28:00.146 --> 28:02.281
Stroke doesn't make sense.

28:07.153 --> 28:09.121
WARNER:
Vivian Calas did have a stroke,

28:09.155 --> 28:11.123
but it wasn't caused by fear.

28:11.157 --> 28:12.925
Puncture mark on her neck.

28:12.959 --> 28:16.495
I missed it at first
because her skin is so wrinkled.

28:16.528 --> 28:19.165
STABLER:
What was she
injected with?

28:19.198 --> 28:21.167
The tox screen
came back negative,

28:21.200 --> 28:23.202
so my guess is air.

28:23.235 --> 28:25.137
How would air kill her?

28:25.171 --> 28:26.438
An air embolus injected

28:26.472 --> 28:28.374
into the carotid artery
would cause a stroke.

28:28.407 --> 28:30.109
The embolus acts like a clot,

28:30.142 --> 28:32.011
blocking the blood flow
to the brain.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.212
BENSON:
No syringe
was found

28:33.245 --> 28:35.014
at the crime scene.
Look, we know

28:35.047 --> 28:36.482
Matt Spevak didn't die
of natural causes,

28:36.515 --> 28:37.750
and now you're telling us

28:37.784 --> 28:39.185
she didn't, either?

28:39.218 --> 28:41.220
Had to have been a third person
in that room.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.856
Only a health professional
would know about an air embolus

28:43.890 --> 28:45.291
and be able to do it properly.

28:47.193 --> 28:49.161
There's one other person
with access

28:49.195 --> 28:51.831
to RDH files, keys and patients.

28:51.864 --> 28:55.134
Spevak's sister, Emma.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.168
Why Emma?

28:56.202 --> 28:58.404
Maybe she and Matt were in
on the murders together.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.272
She finds out
that Matt is going to run

29:00.306 --> 29:01.874
and leave her
to face the music.

29:01.908 --> 29:02.942
Emma kills
Vivian Calas,

29:02.975 --> 29:05.845
then calls Matt
from her house
to come over.

29:05.878 --> 29:07.413
Tells him that
Vivian is sick.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.515
When Matt gets there,
Emma shoots him.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.784
She puts the old lady's
fingerprints on the gun,

29:11.818 --> 29:13.319
on the phone,
and then makes it look

29:13.352 --> 29:14.220
like Matt tried to rob her.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.255
CRAGEN:
Except Emma said
Matt was the one

29:16.288 --> 29:17.256
who strangled her.

29:17.289 --> 29:19.325
But that doesn't play,
because Matt was dead

29:19.358 --> 29:20.426
two hours
before Emma called 911.

29:20.459 --> 29:22.061
So then, who tried
to strangle Emma?

29:22.094 --> 29:23.062
Emma strangled Emma.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.063
She's smart enough

29:24.096 --> 29:25.364
to kill someone with air.

29:25.397 --> 29:27.199
It's easy to choke herself.

29:27.233 --> 29:29.001
It's gonna be
tough to prove.

29:29.035 --> 29:30.202
And we're gonna need the syringe

29:30.236 --> 29:33.339
with Emma's prints to tie her
to Vivian Calas's murder.

29:33.372 --> 29:34.540
Chances are,
Emma dumped it.

29:34.573 --> 29:35.942
I looked at the autopsy photos

29:35.975 --> 29:37.776
of the first three victims.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.312
Strangle me.

29:40.346 --> 29:42.081
I'll try.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.216
I'll hold
the rope.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.985
The first three
original victims were

29:46.018 --> 29:47.386
between five-five
and five-seven.

29:47.419 --> 29:49.922
Matt Spevak was nearly
six feet tall.

29:49.956 --> 29:51.257
Pull.

29:51.290 --> 29:52.358
Look at the angle of the rope.

29:52.391 --> 29:53.860
Upwards from
front to back.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.862
Which is exactly the
way that it should be,

29:55.895 --> 29:57.029
given Matt
Spevak's height

29:57.063 --> 29:58.197
and natural
arm movement.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.399
Oh. Switch
places with me.

30:05.404 --> 30:06.939
Okay. The impression
angles downward.

30:06.973 --> 30:08.240
CRAGEN:
That's what
you would expect

30:08.274 --> 30:10.476
if the perp was shorter
than the victim.

30:10.509 --> 30:12.211
Just like the person

30:12.244 --> 30:13.579
who strangled Claudia,

30:13.612 --> 30:15.381
Donna and Susan.

30:15.414 --> 30:18.250
STABLER:
All angled downward.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.585
Emma Spevak is only
five foot three.

30:19.618 --> 30:20.586
She killed them all.

30:20.619 --> 30:22.088
Your rope trick's not going

30:22.121 --> 30:23.089
to be enough, Doc.

30:23.122 --> 30:24.857
We need a confession from Emma,

30:24.891 --> 30:26.458
or she walks on five murders.

30:28.427 --> 30:30.462
( doorbell ringing )

30:33.465 --> 30:35.301
BENSON:
Emma, we
need to talk.

30:35.334 --> 30:36.468
Can you please come back later?

30:36.502 --> 30:38.270
I'm just not up
to talking right now.

30:38.304 --> 30:39.538
We know you've been
through a lot.

30:39.571 --> 30:41.573
This won't take long.

30:46.412 --> 30:48.981
EMMA:
I've been mourning my brother.

30:49.015 --> 30:51.383
I can't believe that he's dead.

30:52.384 --> 30:53.452
Mom's gone, too.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.487
All I have are these.

31:22.448 --> 31:24.250
BENSON:
That's you with
your brother?

31:24.283 --> 31:27.219
And Mom.

31:27.253 --> 31:28.254
You really loved her.

31:28.287 --> 31:29.355
How long has
she been gone?

31:29.388 --> 31:30.589
Seven years.

31:30.622 --> 31:32.024
What'd she die of?

31:32.058 --> 31:34.060
A stroke.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.368
You said you
needed to talk.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.405
About what?

31:46.438 --> 31:47.239
Matt's death.

31:47.273 --> 31:49.475
To be honest,
we're a little confused,

31:49.508 --> 31:51.543
and you could really
help us out here.

31:51.577 --> 31:52.945
All right.

31:52.979 --> 31:55.114
Now, why don't we start
with your attack?

31:55.147 --> 31:57.283
I think I've told you everything
already.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.450
Tell us again.

31:58.484 --> 32:00.152
Now, who choked you?

32:01.387 --> 32:02.955
My brother.

32:02.989 --> 32:04.590
Why are you torturing me
like this?

32:04.623 --> 32:06.192
Well, see our problem is,

32:06.225 --> 32:08.594
that when EMS found you,
Matt was already dead.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.531
Well, I passed out.

32:12.564 --> 32:15.101
I-I didn't call 911
until I came to.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.136
You-You think I'm

32:17.169 --> 32:18.337
making this up?

32:18.370 --> 32:19.605
Well, what should we think,
Emma?

32:19.638 --> 32:22.141
That Matt tried to kill me.

32:22.174 --> 32:24.510
Matt murdered Vivian Calas.

32:24.543 --> 32:25.978
No, we've ruled him out.

32:26.012 --> 32:28.247
Matt did not murder Vivian.

32:28.280 --> 32:29.415
Who did then?

32:29.448 --> 32:31.083
BENSON:
Oh, we don't know.

32:31.117 --> 32:33.485
That's why we're asking you.

32:35.754 --> 32:37.723
Well, if I think of anything

32:37.756 --> 32:39.958
I'll be sure to call you
right away.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.295
So, Emma killed her mother, too?

32:43.329 --> 32:45.231
She died of a stroke,
just like Vivian Calas.

32:45.264 --> 32:47.499
How much you want to bet
it was caused by an air embolus?

32:47.533 --> 32:49.101
But how are we going
to prove it?

32:49.135 --> 32:50.269
We have to
exhume her body.

32:50.302 --> 32:51.437
I need more
than that.

32:51.470 --> 32:52.571
You got
to check out Emma's house.

32:52.604 --> 32:54.406
The place is like a shrine
to her mother.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.574
So, she loved her--

32:55.607 --> 32:56.675
that's hardly grounds
for an exhumation.

32:56.708 --> 32:59.178
The point I'm making is
that Mommy didn't reciprocate.

32:59.211 --> 33:00.412
Matt got all the attention.

33:00.446 --> 33:01.613
And so now,
she's killing old women

33:01.647 --> 33:03.382
to get back at Mom
for not loving her.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.084
Yeah, but if
Emma knows how
to kill with air,

33:05.117 --> 33:06.185
why is she
changing her M.O.

33:06.218 --> 33:07.319
to strangulation
with a rope?

33:07.353 --> 33:08.620
It was her brother's
climbing rope.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.122
She set him up.

33:10.156 --> 33:11.523
Sibling rivalry.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.092
So Mom really was
Emma's first victim.

33:13.125 --> 33:15.027
HUANG:
Most serial killers
start close to home.

33:15.061 --> 33:16.128
Well, if I can establish

33:16.162 --> 33:17.463
that Emma's mother really
did die

33:17.496 --> 33:18.664
of an air-induced stroke,

33:18.697 --> 33:19.665
then we've got
our probable cause.

33:19.698 --> 33:21.633
STABLER:
Yeah, but Emma's not
gonna fry herself

33:21.667 --> 33:25.104
by letting us dig up her mother.

33:25.137 --> 33:28.107
You know any friendly judges?

33:31.510 --> 33:32.578
What the hell do you want?

33:32.611 --> 33:34.346
I'm so sorry to
bother you at home,

33:34.380 --> 33:35.581
Judge Terhune,
but it's urgent.

33:35.614 --> 33:36.748
Well, I'm in the middle

33:36.782 --> 33:38.450
of something pretty important
myself.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.552
MAN:
Joe, are you
folding this hand?

33:40.586 --> 33:41.687
No! No. C-Come on.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.089
Come on in, all right?

33:43.122 --> 33:44.623
Come on.

33:47.426 --> 33:49.461
I just need Your
Honor's signature.

33:49.495 --> 33:51.463
You hit the jackpot, Dearie.

33:52.598 --> 33:53.765
I'm in.

33:53.799 --> 33:56.668
I believe you all
know ADA Novak.

33:56.702 --> 33:58.504
Judge Ridenour,
Judge Petrovsky,

33:58.537 --> 34:00.672
Judge Wyler,
Judge Bradley.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.441
I've had this
nightmare before,

34:02.474 --> 34:03.809
only I was naked.

34:03.842 --> 34:05.444
Charming.

34:05.477 --> 34:07.113
What could be so important

34:07.146 --> 34:09.281
that it couldn't
wait until morning?

34:09.315 --> 34:10.449
An exhumation order.

34:10.482 --> 34:12.351
You better sign it, Joe.

34:12.384 --> 34:13.719
Corpse might be a flight risk.

34:13.752 --> 34:15.787
NOVAK:
Your Honor,
this body may
be the key

34:15.821 --> 34:17.189
to solving
six murders.

34:17.223 --> 34:18.190
I'm in.

34:18.224 --> 34:19.191
And I take it

34:19.225 --> 34:19.991
the family won't
consent, hmm?

34:20.025 --> 34:20.759
The suspect is
the sole survivor.

34:20.792 --> 34:22.794
We want to exhume
her mother.

34:22.828 --> 34:23.795
Raise.

34:23.829 --> 34:25.231
We think she
killed her, too.

34:25.264 --> 34:25.997
Was the mom's death
ruled a homicide?

34:26.031 --> 34:27.533
No, but we have
new evidence.

34:27.566 --> 34:29.435
JUDGE TERHUNE:
And you want me to disturb

34:29.468 --> 34:32.471
the sanctity of the
dead on your say-so?

34:32.504 --> 34:36.108
I have a very convincing
but long argument.

34:36.142 --> 34:37.209
It'll disturb the sanctity

34:37.243 --> 34:39.311
of your
poker game.

34:42.681 --> 34:45.117
Thank you.

34:45.151 --> 34:48.086
Go. Go. Go, go.

34:52.324 --> 34:53.825
STABLER:
What are the chances
of finding a needle mark

34:53.859 --> 34:54.926
after seven years?

34:54.960 --> 34:57.529
New York State law requires
all cadavers be embalmed.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.198
The skin should still be intact.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.233
Whenever you're ready.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.636
( engine chugging )

35:06.205 --> 35:08.540
What kind of
family engraves the
name of their kids

35:08.574 --> 35:10.309
into their headstone
before they die?

35:10.342 --> 35:11.477
A really close one?

35:11.510 --> 35:12.678
Check that out.

35:12.711 --> 35:16.148
Matthew and Emma--
born May 9, 1971.

35:16.182 --> 35:18.217
They're twins.

35:21.520 --> 35:23.522
HUANG:
Fraternal twins.

35:23.555 --> 35:25.157
I checked the
hospital records.

35:25.191 --> 35:26.725
Emma Spevak was
born two minutes

35:26.758 --> 35:28.227
after her brother Matt.

35:28.260 --> 35:29.295
Man, she's been following

35:29.328 --> 35:29.995
in his footsteps her whole life.

35:30.028 --> 35:30.496
Always trying
to catch up,

35:30.529 --> 35:31.930
but never able to.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.432
HUANG:
That's why she
used the rope.

35:33.465 --> 35:35.601
She hates her brother,
but she's bound to him.

35:35.634 --> 35:36.768
This is all fascinating,

35:36.802 --> 35:38.704
but it doesn't help us
send Emma upstate.

35:38.737 --> 35:39.905
WARNER:
This will.

35:40.939 --> 35:42.808
Margaret Spevak's
mummified neck.

35:42.841 --> 35:44.176
And a small

35:44.210 --> 35:46.445
needle mark
in the carotid artery.

35:46.478 --> 35:48.480
Emma killed her mother
with an air embolus.

35:48.514 --> 35:49.481
Can you prove it?

35:49.515 --> 35:50.482
WARNER:
No.

35:50.516 --> 35:51.417
Emma doesn't know that.

35:51.450 --> 35:52.451
HUANG:
Be careful.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.552
She's spent
her whole life

35:53.585 --> 35:54.520
hating her mother.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.522
If you confront her
with what she's done,

35:56.555 --> 35:57.589
she's never going to talk.

35:57.623 --> 35:58.490
Okay. So, what, empathy?

35:58.524 --> 35:59.891
She's going to need
more than empathy.

35:59.925 --> 36:01.360
She's going to
need an ally.

36:01.393 --> 36:02.428
So, how do we do that?

36:02.461 --> 36:04.630
Reenact the sibling rivalry.

36:07.766 --> 36:09.335
Can I get you
something to drink?

36:09.368 --> 36:10.502
I'm okay.

36:10.536 --> 36:11.703
Why did I have
to come down here?

36:11.737 --> 36:13.505
Uh, we wanted to
apologize to you.

36:13.539 --> 36:14.740
Personally.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.208
Apologize? For what?

36:16.242 --> 36:17.476
For dragging
you into this.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.877
Emma,

36:18.910 --> 36:20.346
we've made a terrible mistake.

36:20.379 --> 36:22.848
What kind of mistake?

36:22.881 --> 36:25.551
We searched Matt's apartment.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.653
And we found his rock-climbing
equipment.

36:27.686 --> 36:30.289
His rope matches
the strangulation mark

36:30.322 --> 36:31.923
on those poor women's necks.

36:34.860 --> 36:35.927
I understand.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.529
You were just doing your job.

36:37.563 --> 36:38.797
We are so sorry.

36:38.830 --> 36:40.432
Am I free to go?

36:40.466 --> 36:41.633
Yeah.

36:41.667 --> 36:43.435
Come here. Come here.

36:43.469 --> 36:45.504
Come here!

36:50.576 --> 36:51.810
What are you doing?

36:51.843 --> 36:53.845
Are you apologizing to her?

36:53.879 --> 36:54.846
What do you care?

36:54.880 --> 36:55.981
What do I care?
I'm in charge.

36:56.014 --> 36:56.982
My case, remember?

36:57.015 --> 36:58.149
Elliot, this
is our case.

36:58.183 --> 37:00.286
Please don't talk
to me like this
in front of her.

37:00.319 --> 37:01.920
We're equals.
( laughs ):
Right.

37:01.953 --> 37:05.357
Did she bring you down here?
Yeah?

37:05.391 --> 37:06.592
You bring her down here,
so you can take the credit?

37:06.625 --> 37:07.926
No, I brought her down
here 'cause I knew

37:07.959 --> 37:08.994
that you wouldn't
apologize.

37:09.027 --> 37:10.529
Well, you're damn right
about that.

37:10.562 --> 37:11.630
We wouldn't even be here

37:11.663 --> 37:13.299
if Emma had the guts
to open her mouth.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.533
What are you talking about?

37:14.566 --> 37:15.667
You knew what was going on.

37:15.701 --> 37:17.569
You knew your brother was up
to his ass

37:17.603 --> 37:19.571
in gambling debts
and using the foundation

37:19.605 --> 37:20.606
to cover himself.

37:20.639 --> 37:21.640
You did nothing about it,

37:21.673 --> 37:22.274
and you went right along
with him.

37:22.308 --> 37:23.041
No!

37:23.074 --> 37:24.075
You're a liar.
Elliot.

37:24.109 --> 37:26.712
You protect your brother,
and he almost kills you.

37:26.745 --> 37:27.679
You're pathetic.

37:27.713 --> 37:30.682
I loved my brother.

37:30.716 --> 37:31.049
Elliot, leave
her alone.

37:31.082 --> 37:32.451
Shut up.

37:32.484 --> 37:34.953
You know what the problem is?

37:34.986 --> 37:35.921
Women shouldn't be cops.

37:35.954 --> 37:37.323
They shouldn't be doctors.

37:37.356 --> 37:40.292
They're too weak and stupid.

37:46.064 --> 37:48.066
I'm sorry about that.

37:48.099 --> 37:50.936
Does he always talk
to you like that?

37:50.969 --> 37:52.471
You heard him.

37:52.504 --> 37:55.341
He's in charge.

37:55.374 --> 37:57.443
I'm sure you know how it is.

38:02.548 --> 38:04.850
( sighs )

38:05.884 --> 38:08.520
Do I ever.

38:08.554 --> 38:10.522
I was always the good girl.

38:10.556 --> 38:11.823
Always the helper.

38:11.857 --> 38:12.824
Emma, do this.

38:12.858 --> 38:14.860
Emma, do that.

38:18.597 --> 38:20.832
I know how you feel.

38:20.866 --> 38:24.035
My mother was a drunk.

38:24.069 --> 38:26.638
And I had to carry her
into her bed every night.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.874
I've had to scoop the vomit
off the floor.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.943
I thought I'd never escape.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.512
But you did.

38:33.545 --> 38:35.581
Yeah, after she died.

38:36.982 --> 38:38.984
It's the only time
that I ever felt free.

38:41.553 --> 38:43.655
( sighs )

38:45.791 --> 38:47.759
Mothers are all the same.

38:47.793 --> 38:48.660
You try to be good to them,

38:48.694 --> 38:50.829
and all they do is treat you
like dirt.

38:52.498 --> 38:53.965
You're a nurse.
You're a caregiver.

38:53.999 --> 38:55.934
I'm sure you were great
to your mother.

38:55.967 --> 38:58.103
She had cancer.

38:58.136 --> 39:00.672
I took care of her
for five years.

39:00.706 --> 39:02.007
Five years?

39:02.040 --> 39:03.909
Where was your brother?

39:03.942 --> 39:06.645
Matt was off in medical school.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.980
And then doing his residency.

39:09.014 --> 39:10.982
Mama used all of her money
to pay for it.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.784
Oh, and I'm sure
he didn't appreciate it.

39:12.818 --> 39:15.020
I'm sure he just took you
for granted.

39:15.053 --> 39:15.921
He made me work for him.

39:15.954 --> 39:18.390
He made me take care
of all those women

39:18.424 --> 39:20.726
that were just like Mama.

39:20.759 --> 39:24.129
Wash my clothes, walk my dog,
clean my fridge.

39:24.162 --> 39:25.964
A girl can only take so much.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.600
They thought that
my brother was a god.

39:28.634 --> 39:29.901
I took care of them.

39:29.935 --> 39:30.936
I did all the work.

39:30.969 --> 39:33.071
You had to do something.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.106
Yes.

39:38.043 --> 39:41.046
With Matt's rope.

39:41.079 --> 39:43.449
Then I was free.

39:45.050 --> 39:48.487
Just like with your mother.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.490
Yes.

39:53.058 --> 39:55.427
How did you do it, Emma?

39:57.596 --> 39:59.731
With a little shot of air.

39:59.765 --> 40:02.067
It always worked so quickly.

40:03.969 --> 40:05.571
What do you mean?

40:05.604 --> 40:07.773
When I was in nursing school,
I'd see daughters

40:07.806 --> 40:10.141
by their mothers' beds, trapped,

40:10.175 --> 40:12.911
watching their lives disappear.

40:15.246 --> 40:18.183
So, you helped them.

40:19.217 --> 40:20.786
I set them free.

40:20.819 --> 40:21.953
How many were there?

40:21.987 --> 40:23.989
Dozens.

40:26.124 --> 40:28.193
Do you remember any
of their names?

40:30.996 --> 40:33.865
They were all called Mama.
