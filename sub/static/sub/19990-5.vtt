Another order? Okay!

01:08.540 --> 01:09.540
Get ready, Spaty!

01:09.540 --> 01:10.860
Time to grill up one more...

01:10.860 --> 01:12.860
...golden-piping hot Krabby Patt- wha?

01:13.180 --> 01:14.940
Double dipped milkshake?

01:15.180 --> 01:17.220
Gee! I haven't made one of those in awhile!

01:22.700 --> 01:23.720
Order up!

01:26.180 --> 01:28.060
One double dipped milkshake!

01:28.620 --> 01:29.960
Wait!

01:30.300 --> 01:31.780
I almost forgot!

01:31.920 --> 01:33.280
Cherry on top!

01:33.580 --> 01:34.580
There you are sir!

01:34.580 --> 01:36.580
A perfect double dipped milkshake!

01:36.680 --> 01:38.940
- Enjoy!
- Well! It looks delightful!

01:47.740 --> 01:48.980
This thing's frozen!

01:49.440 --> 01:50.480
BARNACLES!

01:50.600 --> 01:52.480
How am I supposed to drink this!?

01:54.200 --> 01:55.100
Gah!

01:55.760 --> 01:57.600
This shake is disgusting!

01:58.680 --> 02:01.500
Why, you probably don't even have a license to milkshake!

02:01.500 --> 02:03.280
A license to milkshake?

02:03.420 --> 02:05.480
Well of course I do silly!

02:07.480 --> 02:09.720
And it doesn't expire until...

02:09.919 --> 02:11.520
...seven years ago!?

02:11.600 --> 02:15.100
Your milkshake license expired seven years ago!?

02:15.100 --> 02:18.440
Outrageous! I demand a refund!

02:19.320 --> 02:20.100
No!

02:20.300 --> 02:23.020
Let's not say things we might regret later!

02:23.160 --> 02:25.100
Tell you what, you come back tomorrow...

02:25.100 --> 02:27.940
...and SpongeBob will make you a proper milkshake.

02:28.140 --> 02:29.940
Alright! See you tomorrow!

02:36.580 --> 02:38.180
Where are we going, Mr. Krabs?

02:38.180 --> 02:40.180
I'm taking you back to school!

02:42.580 --> 02:44.100
<i>"One, two, three, four"</i>

02:46.280 --> 02:49.660
There you are boy! The Milkshake Academy!

02:50.300 --> 02:52.800
You know boy? Milkshaking technology and...

02:52.800 --> 02:53.900
...know-how is advanced...

02:53.900 --> 02:55.340
...since you were last a cadet!

02:55.420 --> 02:57.340
I shall do my best sir!

02:59.080 --> 03:01.140
Hey! Look! Up at the sea!

03:07.080 --> 03:09.640
I don't think he's wearing a parachute.

03:14.720 --> 03:16.000
At ease, cadets!

03:19.740 --> 03:21.540
Welcome to the Milkshake Academy.

03:21.540 --> 03:24.460
I'm your instructor: Captain Frostymug!

03:24.460 --> 03:26.560
Let's not beat around the bush here boys.

03:26.560 --> 03:27.640
Your mamma's not here...

03:27.640 --> 03:28.960
...to wipe the whipped cream...

03:28.960 --> 03:30.480
...from your chinny-chin-chins!

03:30.480 --> 03:32.240
And I'm not here to help you...

03:32.240 --> 03:33.720
...with your bendy straws.

03:33.760 --> 03:36.760
My sole purpose is to transform you...

03:36.760 --> 03:39.220
...from mere guppies into cool...

03:39.320 --> 03:41.960
...cold-drafted, chilled to the bone...

03:41.960 --> 03:43.720
...ice cream blooded...

03:43.720 --> 03:47.180
...licensed milkshake makin' guppies!

03:47.180 --> 03:50.320
But you must prove yourself worthy of this distinction!

03:50.320 --> 03:52.080
Do you consire youself worthy?

03:52.080 --> 03:53.340
Cadet Squarepants?

03:53.400 --> 03:55.620
Yes sir! Worthy and ready!

03:55.700 --> 03:58.280
I see. Then this first test will be a breeze.

03:58.640 --> 04:00.800
What do you call... this?

04:01.560 --> 04:02.520
Oh, that's easy!

04:02.520 --> 04:04.520
It's an ice cream spatula!

04:07.260 --> 04:08.180
That's enough!

04:08.480 --> 04:11.880
This, Cadet Squarepants, is your scooper.

04:12.040 --> 04:14.820
The most vital weapon in the milkshaker's arsenal!

04:14.920 --> 04:18.100
It's clear that most of you understand the fundamentals.

04:18.240 --> 04:20.380
Now it's time to see what you can do!

04:20.519 --> 04:21.380
Cadets!

04:21.700 --> 04:24.400
Man your milky, milky stations!

04:29.140 --> 04:31.440
A few more bells and whistles than I'm used to.

04:31.440 --> 04:33.440
But I think I can work with this!

04:39.980 --> 04:40.800
Oh dear!

04:45.640 --> 04:47.160
Fantastic!

04:47.360 --> 04:49.440
Nice and creamy mouth feel!

04:51.200 --> 04:55.080
SquarePants appears to be having problems... again.

04:55.700 --> 04:58.280
You! Please explain where he has gone wrong!

04:58.280 --> 04:59.680
Sir, yes sir!

04:59.800 --> 05:03.380
Sir! He is attempting to use the upper control panels to mix!

05:03.380 --> 05:06.620
Sir! Every cadet knows that these are telementry functions.

05:06.620 --> 05:09.440
And all of the controls are on the lower panel! Sir!

05:09.580 --> 05:11.420
Oh! That's right!

05:11.420 --> 05:13.780
Heh, how silly of me! Mr. Krabs' right.

05:13.780 --> 05:16.740
Milkshaking has changed over the years.

05:19.520 --> 05:22.120
Very good! But how does it taste?

05:30.640 --> 05:33.440
Maybe we need to get back to basics.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.360
Listen up Cadet Squarepants!

05:36.360 --> 05:37.940
If you want to make a milkshake...

05:37.940 --> 05:40.520
...you gotta know how it feels to be a shake!

05:40.700 --> 05:43.400
Behold! The Shake Simulator.

05:43.580 --> 05:45.520
In you go. Now! March!

05:45.620 --> 05:47.180
Hut two three four!

05:47.180 --> 05:49.660
Hut two three four! Hut!

05:52.860 --> 05:54.420
Teach this upstart a lesson...

05:54.420 --> 05:56.860
I'm setting it to "obliterate!"

05:58.440 --> 06:00.900
But sir! No one's ever survived "obliterate!"

06:00.900 --> 06:01.860
Silence!

06:01.860 --> 06:04.140
He needs to learn cadet.

06:11.420 --> 06:14.380
Now, let's see how the boy turned out.

06:20.640 --> 06:23.020
That was fun! Can I go again?

06:26.340 --> 06:29.360
Never, in my thirty years of milkshake instruction...

06:29.360 --> 06:31.980
...have I had such an unteachable moron!

06:32.040 --> 06:33.100
Cadets!

06:33.100 --> 06:36.480
Do you have any ideas on how to teach Cadet SpongeBob?

06:36.560 --> 06:40.000
You'd be better off teaching a hunk of coral, sir!

06:42.780 --> 06:44.120
I'll show you!

06:44.120 --> 06:47.140
I'll show you all I can make a milkshake!

08:24.940 --> 08:29.120
When you first came to me just four short hours ago...

08:29.120 --> 08:32.020
...you were nothing but a bunch of soda jerks!

08:32.100 --> 08:34.500
But now, you stand before me...

08:34.500 --> 08:38.340
...proud, mighty, milkshake makin' machines!

08:38.720 --> 08:40.200
It is with great pride...

08:40.200 --> 08:42.059
...I bestow upon you...

08:42.059 --> 08:44.420
...your milkshake operator license!

08:44.420 --> 08:46.620
Now, come up here and get them!

09:02.060 --> 09:05.780
Well! I'm afraid there're aren't no more milkshake licenses.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.080
And do you know why?

09:08.520 --> 09:10.440
Um... the printer ran out of ink?

09:10.540 --> 09:12.300
No, you simpleton!

09:12.300 --> 09:14.560
There're aren't anymore milkshake licenses...

09:14.560 --> 09:16.600
...because YOU don't get one!

09:17.960 --> 09:19.000
Why not?

09:19.860 --> 09:21.200
Hmm... let me see.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.600
Maybe it's got something to do with the fact...

09:23.600 --> 09:26.120
...that you couldn't even get past Step #1...

09:26.220 --> 09:27.800
...of making a milkshake:

09:27.800 --> 09:29.840
Filling the glass with ice cream!

09:29.840 --> 09:31.460
 NO Captain Frostymug!

09:31.460 --> 09:33.400
I can do it! Let me show you!

09:33.400 --> 09:34.860
I just know I can!

09:34.860 --> 09:37.420
No, here let me show you!

09:37.740 --> 09:41.040
You're suppose to raise the cup to the spinny thing!

09:42.000 --> 09:43.380
Um, the...

09:44.000 --> 09:45.540
the spinny thing...

09:52.460 --> 09:57.520
 Boy! I can't wait to have one of your renowned shakes Sir Frostymug!

09:57.640 --> 10:00.720
You tried the rest, now prepare for the best!

10:09.780 --> 10:11.640
Nooooo!

10:11.860 --> 10:13.520
What's wrong Captain Frostymug?

10:13.520 --> 10:16.960
I haven't touched a milkshake machine in twenty years!

10:17.320 --> 10:19.440
Dear Neptune's thunderclap!

10:19.440 --> 10:21.380
I'm stuck in the blender!

10:21.380 --> 10:22.960
Heeeelp!

10:22.960 --> 10:24.500
Captain Frostymug!

10:25.800 --> 10:26.800
My arm!

10:27.640 --> 10:29.200
Don't worry sir! I'm coming!

10:29.200 --> 10:30.960
I Gotcha you Captain!

10:31.020 --> 10:32.560
Save yourself boy!

10:32.560 --> 10:33.800
I'm a goner!

10:33.800 --> 10:36.380
No! I'm not leaving you behind!

10:46.120 --> 10:47.860
Thanks, SpongeBob.

10:49.180 --> 10:51.220
You know, no one has ever treated this...

10:51.220 --> 10:52.900
...old captain with much kindness.

10:52.900 --> 10:54.400
And in return...

10:54.820 --> 10:56.700
...I'd like to tell you a little secret.

10:56.840 --> 10:57.940
All these years...

10:57.940 --> 10:59.700
I've been able to make milkshake...

10:59.700 --> 11:01.380
...without machines because...

11:01.380 --> 11:05.340
...making milkshakes really comes from within!

11:05.480 --> 11:07.340
Does that make sense?

11:07.760 --> 11:09.340
Not at all.

11:10.640 --> 11:13.140
 One milkshake, coming right up!

11:25.900 --> 11:27.940
You redeemed yourself SpongeBob!

11:27.940 --> 11:31.040
This is the BEST milkshake I'd ever had!

11:33.420 --> 11:35.840
Where'd you learn those moves, SpongeBob?

11:35.840 --> 11:37.100
That would be from me!

11:37.100 --> 11:39.640
And in light of decent events, SpongeBob.

11:39.720 --> 11:41.800
I'd like to give you this.

11:43.220 --> 11:45.740
My milkshake license!

11:45.740 --> 11:48.960
If only it were this easy to get a boating license!

12:04.900 --> 12:08.600
In droplets gently cascade over your body.

12:10.420 --> 12:14.080
Visualize yourself in a private grotto.

12:14.440 --> 12:17.440
Focus your perceptions animated form.

12:17.480 --> 12:20.620
In the soothing nature of the rustic call.

12:22.960 --> 12:25.200
You are one with nature.

12:28.880 --> 12:30.000
What the-

12:31.680 --> 12:32.960
Barnacles!

12:33.040 --> 12:35.660
How do you like that, baby?

12:37.060 --> 12:37.960
Oh yeah.

12:38.100 --> 12:41.700
Well, what do ya think about this, baby?

12:43.500 --> 12:44.540
Question.

12:44.540 --> 12:48.580
Are you two acting even more infantile than usual this morning?

12:48.580 --> 12:49.400
Uh, huh.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.000
Cause I found a box of my old baby toys in the attic.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.860
And we're playing with them.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.340
Hey! My old Teddy Walrus!

12:58.080 --> 12:59.980
This stuff really takes me back.

13:02.780 --> 13:05.940
Yeah. It makes me feel baby-ish.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.480
Oh. Look at me I'm a baby!

13:09.640 --> 13:12.020
Babies don't talk like that Patrick.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.000
They talk like...

13:37.340 --> 13:40.120
Just as the essential oils were kicking in.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.140
Hey! I'd appreciate some quiet!

13:44.840 --> 13:46.520
How dare you scoot away from me?

13:46.520 --> 13:48.360
I'm scolding here!

13:49.180 --> 13:53.080
Would you two for once, act your age!

13:58.980 --> 14:01.520
Fine! Act like infants you're whole life!

14:01.520 --> 14:02.660
See if I care!

14:02.660 --> 14:05.380
I'm returning to my grown up lifestyle.

14:05.380 --> 14:06.880
So keep it down!

14:13.660 --> 14:14.840
Squidward!

14:19.880 --> 14:23.380
Hey, he's mumblin' and droolin' like a little baby.

14:23.560 --> 14:25.100
Well, I don't know, Patrick.

14:25.100 --> 14:26.500
He isn't looking so good.

14:26.500 --> 14:28.360
He should probably see a doctor.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.520
Come on, let's take him to the hospital!

14:30.520 --> 14:31.840
Hang in there buddy.

14:31.840 --> 14:33.840
We'll have you fixed up in no time.

14:40.680 --> 14:42.720
So, what's the prognosis doctor?

14:42.720 --> 14:44.780
Your friend has a condition known...

14:44.780 --> 14:46.560
...by the medical term of...

14:46.560 --> 14:48.600
...Head-go-boom-boom-itis.

14:48.600 --> 14:49.800
Not to worry though...

14:49.800 --> 14:52.120
...he should recover over normally over time.

14:52.120 --> 14:55.380
But he mustn't receive any more blows to the head...

14:55.440 --> 14:58.920
...or he may remain this way permanently.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.100
Just care for him...

15:00.100 --> 15:01.640
...as if were your very own...

15:01.640 --> 15:03.020
...bouncy baby boy...

15:03.020 --> 15:05.020
...and he'll be fine.

15:05.400 --> 15:06.800
Hey little Squidward.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.800
Ready for some fun?

15:09.000 --> 15:10.460
Woop-ee-doo!

15:11.520 --> 15:13.860
Okay Squidie! Din din is ready.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.740
Where is our little miracle?

15:17.980 --> 15:20.080
Patrick, how could you!

15:20.860 --> 15:23.340
There! My little darling.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.100
Were supposed to protect his head remember?

15:28.460 --> 15:30.760
Okay Squidie! I made your favorite.

15:30.760 --> 15:32.920
Grilled Tar Tar with a algae vinaigrette.

15:32.920 --> 15:35.600
Here it comes, open wide!

15:35.700 --> 15:37.060
Oh, come on little buddy.

15:37.060 --> 15:38.100
You got eat healthy...

15:38.100 --> 15:40.100
...so you can grow up to be big and cranky.

15:40.100 --> 15:43.260
Just like the airplane landing in the hanger.

15:45.640 --> 15:46.660
See Patrick?

15:46.660 --> 15:49.060
Sometimes you have to out-think the baby.

15:53.700 --> 15:55.360
You know Patrick maybe...

15:57.940 --> 16:00.000
Thanks for sharing baby.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.760
OK. Time to lighten things up!

16:02.780 --> 16:04.220
Do you like games Squidie?

16:04.220 --> 16:06.220
Games is our middle name!

16:07.820 --> 16:09.500
<i>Kelpy Cake, Kelpy Cake</i>

16:09.500 --> 16:10.900
<i>Kelpy Man</i>

16:10.900 --> 16:13.740
<i>eafsdfsdfsd</i>

16:17.280 --> 16:18.980
You like that Squidie?

16:20.300 --> 16:22.540
- He does!
- Now you try.

16:29.380 --> 16:31.800
This game's kinda dangerous.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.280
Squidie!

16:41.300 --> 16:43.160
Squidie! No!

16:43.480 --> 16:45.480
Don't worry. I got this!

16:52.300 --> 16:53.660
Hooray!

16:54.800 --> 16:56.380
Huh! Squidward!

16:58.180 --> 17:00.260
Squidie, are you okay?

17:05.020 --> 17:07.940
We need to do a better job of protecting him.

17:14.579 --> 17:18.040
There, there now, no need to cry.

17:22.460 --> 17:24.420
Everything is gonna be okay.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.000
Hey, don't worry.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.540
He'll be settled down in couple of minutes.

18:03.280 --> 18:05.640
72 hours later...

18:10.280 --> 18:12.300
It's 1 minute till opening.

18:12.300 --> 18:14.740
Where the barnacles are me employeries?

18:14.740 --> 18:16.740
I don't pay them to be late.

18:20.120 --> 18:22.500
Taking care of a baby sure is hard.

18:22.500 --> 18:24.620
You said it! I'm exhausted!

18:24.620 --> 18:26.200
Hey, Patrick. I have to go to work.

18:26.200 --> 18:28.320
Would you mind holding Squidw...

18:29.740 --> 18:31.920
Looks like we're the only, little fella.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.580
SpongeBob, Squidward!

18:33.580 --> 18:35.020
Enough duff-dragging!

18:35.020 --> 18:37.020
Get to your stations, pronto!

18:37.100 --> 18:39.400
Mr. Krabs, Squidward is in no condition...

18:39.400 --> 18:41.400
...to perform his Krusty duties.

18:43.920 --> 18:46.040
The poor guy has the mind of an infant.

18:46.040 --> 18:48.740
I don't care if he has seaweed-for-brains.

18:48.860 --> 18:50.840
He needs to be behind that register.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.360
We've got customers out there...

18:52.360 --> 18:54.600
...just begging to hand me their money.

18:58.020 --> 19:01.280
- But...
- No buts! Get to work, you two!

19:03.300 --> 19:05.560
All settled into your work station, I see.

19:05.560 --> 19:08.200
Maybe you're ready for your Krusty duties after all.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.200
Now let's make it official!

19:11.540 --> 19:12.880
How silly of me!

19:14.940 --> 19:17.220
Squiddy needs a high chair!

19:20.780 --> 19:22.220
And duct tape!

19:23.860 --> 19:25.720
Oh, Squiddy. I'm so proud of you.

19:25.720 --> 19:28.040
Just yesterday, you were drooling all over me.

19:28.040 --> 19:29.240
And look at you now.

19:29.240 --> 19:31.580
Working and sitting in a big boy seat!

19:31.580 --> 19:33.920
All right! That's enough, you two.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.920
Time to serve some customers!

19:37.540 --> 19:40.280
Remember, buddy. I'll be right behind you.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.060
Can I get a Krabby Patty...

19:43.060 --> 19:45.300
...and a large kelp shake, please?

19:47.720 --> 19:50.220
Okay. How much do I owe ya?

19:53.460 --> 19:54.640
Squidward!

19:55.440 --> 19:57.160
That's not for eating!

19:59.440 --> 20:01.980
There we are. Good as neww-

20:02.620 --> 20:04.620
That's not for eating either!

20:05.000 --> 20:05.800
Sorry, sir.

20:05.820 --> 20:08.780
Hop to it, boys. We haven't even taken our first order!

20:08.780 --> 20:10.140
Yes, Mr. Krabs!

20:10.140 --> 20:11.760
You know what to do.

20:13.220 --> 20:15.720
Thanks, Squiddy. I can also count on, huh...

20:16.800 --> 20:19.020
Will this be for here or to goo?

20:24.340 --> 20:27.160
We have to work on your penmanship, Squiddy.

20:29.540 --> 20:31.580
My face! My face!

20:31.700 --> 20:34.140
Also my leg, but mostly my face!

20:34.240 --> 20:36.320
 Hey! You going to take an order or what?

20:42.180 --> 20:43.540
Squidward!

20:43.840 --> 20:46.140
Yelling at a poor, defenseless baby!

20:46.140 --> 20:47.340
You oughta be ashamed.

20:47.340 --> 20:48.400
Listen, man!

20:48.400 --> 20:50.540
I'm done playing these baby games!

20:51.980 --> 20:53.400
Oh, my Neptune!

20:56.400 --> 20:58.540
<i>What is that? What is it?</i>

20:59.420 --> 21:02.120
What in blazes is going on around her...

21:03.440 --> 21:04.560
Mr. Squidward!

21:05.760 --> 21:07.360
Where are your manners?

21:07.360 --> 21:10.000
- Mr. Krabs, watch his head!
- Watch his head?

21:10.060 --> 21:12.260
Why don't you watch his diaper?

21:13.080 --> 21:15.100
And get it changed!

21:15.200 --> 21:16.680
Yes, sir! Yes, sir!

21:18.140 --> 21:20.700
- We're eating here!
- Sorry!

21:23.160 --> 21:26.540
- Hey, I'm trying to walk here!
- Sorry!

21:27.320 --> 21:30.960
- Hey, I was gonna get ketchup there!
- Sorry!

21:32.040 --> 21:34.220
Okay, Squiddy. Hold still!

21:35.260 --> 21:36.980
Oh, boy!

21:37.220 --> 21:39.500
Are you out of your ever-living mind?!

21:39.500 --> 21:41.240
We can't change that baby out here...

21:41.240 --> 21:42.780
...in front of the customers!

21:42.800 --> 21:45.140
Take him in back where the food is prepared.

21:48.520 --> 21:49.940
Oh, that's it!

21:49.940 --> 21:53.020
Get that poopy baby out of me restaurant!

21:53.620 --> 21:54.820
Mr. Krabs.

21:54.820 --> 21:57.240
If my poopy baby isn't welcome here...

21:57.240 --> 21:59.060
...then I'm not staying either!

22:14.640 --> 22:15.880
Squidward!

22:19.520 --> 22:20.580
What the-

22:20.980 --> 22:22.060
Where am I?

22:22.060 --> 22:23.580
What's going on?

22:23.600 --> 22:26.600
Oh, Squidward. You're back to your normal grown-up self.

22:26.600 --> 22:28.600
Of course I'm grown up!

22:28.600 --> 22:30.280
Why wouldn't I be?!

22:31.480 --> 22:33.900
Am I wearing a diaper?

22:33.900 --> 22:36.200
- Yes.
- Is it full?

22:37.520 --> 22:38.620
Sorry, Squidward!

22:38.620 --> 22:40.940
I was gonna change it, but I got in the wra...
- Stop!

22:41.360 --> 22:44.220
Not another word about this.

22:45.020 --> 22:47.100
Ever!

22:47.260 --> 22:50.020
Kids, they grow up so fast.
