00:16.917 --> 00:18.583
Here you go, thanks.
Next please?

00:18.583 --> 00:20.792
- Bret: Can I grab one
of the apples, please?
- Uh, you, sir?

00:20.792 --> 00:22.792
- And a-- and a banana.
- I think he was first.

00:22.792 --> 00:24.583
No, you were first.
What are you having, sir?

00:24.583 --> 00:27.083
- Uh, two apples.
- All right.

00:28.417 --> 00:31.125
Don't-- don't forget
to get me my, uh, banana.

00:31.125 --> 00:32.875
Thanks.

00:32.875 --> 00:36.125
Excuse me, sir,
I'll just, um-- get one
of the apples, please.

00:36.125 --> 00:37.750
- And a banana.
- A banana.

00:37.750 --> 00:40.125
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

00:40.125 --> 00:41.417
Excuse me.

00:41.417 --> 00:43.208
Look, guys, I don't want
any trouble here, all right?

00:43.208 --> 00:45.375
- I'm sorry?
- Where are you from?

00:45.375 --> 00:47.375
- Bret: New Zealand.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:47.375 --> 00:49.458
Why don't you get lost?
I don't serve your kind here.

00:49.458 --> 00:51.959
Um, I'd just like
to buy an apple, please?

00:51.959 --> 00:55.125
- And-- and a banana, Bret.
- That one, thanks.

00:55.125 --> 00:56.625
That apple isn't for sale.

00:56.625 --> 00:58.834
Neila,

00:58.834 --> 01:00.917
can you go boil this
in disinfectant?

01:00.917 --> 01:02.417
Thank you.

01:02.417 --> 01:04.375
I don't want our customers
complaining that our fruit

01:04.375 --> 01:06.291
tastes like New Zealanders.

01:07.417 --> 01:08.834
Hmmm.

01:08.834 --> 01:11.291
Okay, well,
thank you very much.

01:11.291 --> 01:13.291
Yeah.
Thanks, guys.

01:16.291 --> 01:18.333
( theme music playing )

01:27.041 --> 01:28.792
( blows whistle )

01:50.834 --> 01:53.375
Okay, band meeting.
Jemaine.

01:53.375 --> 01:55.417
- Yes.
- Bret.

01:55.417 --> 01:58.500
( sighs )
What's wrong with
being from New Zealand?

01:58.500 --> 02:00.375
Are you picking
on Bret again, Jemaine?

02:00.375 --> 02:02.333
No, I-- I didn't
pick on him.

02:02.333 --> 02:04.542
- It was a--
- You're from
New Zealand as well.

02:04.542 --> 02:05.834
Yeah, I know that.

02:05.834 --> 02:07.792
Murray-- present.
And I'm from New Zealand.

02:07.792 --> 02:09.125
You're insulting me as well.

02:09.125 --> 02:10.959
I didn't-- but-- but it
wasn't even me that--

02:10.959 --> 02:13.709
You're hurting all of us
when you bring down
New Zealand, okay?

02:13.709 --> 02:16.625
- Stop it.
- I-- but I didn't
pick on him.

02:16.625 --> 02:18.917
Tension in the band.

02:18.917 --> 02:22.542
Bret upset.
All sorted now.

02:22.542 --> 02:25.041
- Do we have any gigs,
Murray or--
- No.

02:25.041 --> 02:26.709
--any band opportunities?

02:26.709 --> 02:28.834
Actually, Bret,
something from your mom.

02:28.834 --> 02:31.041
Here we are.
You might like this.

02:31.041 --> 02:33.041
- Ohhh--
- I don't know what
it is. It seems empty.

02:33.041 --> 02:35.375
Oh, great.
This is my favorite box.

02:35.375 --> 02:37.041
And I got this
from my mom.

02:37.041 --> 02:38.875
Nothing from your mom, Jemaine.

02:38.875 --> 02:40.291
So?

02:40.291 --> 02:42.583
I'm just saying, all right?

02:42.583 --> 02:44.375
I've got a DVD here

02:44.375 --> 02:46.875
that mom recorded
from TV shows back home.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.750
I thought you
might wanna watch it.

02:48.750 --> 02:50.750
That's not a DVD,
by the way.

02:50.750 --> 02:53.583
Yes, it is.
Dubbed Video Dub.

02:53.583 --> 02:55.166
- ( knocking )
- Oh, hello.

02:55.166 --> 02:57.542
- Tech support.
- Uh, sorry to interrupt.

02:57.542 --> 02:59.125
Um, I got your memo.

02:59.125 --> 03:01.333
You wanted to know when
I'd be installing
your new computer?

03:01.333 --> 03:03.583
- Yes.
- Still 2:30.

03:03.583 --> 03:06.208
Okay. Good.
I'm still free then.

03:06.208 --> 03:07.709
Okay. See ya.

03:07.709 --> 03:10.166
- Oh, this is my band
I was telling you about.
- oh.

03:10.166 --> 03:11.709
- This is, uh, Jemaine.
- How are ya?

03:11.709 --> 03:14.041
- Hi. Hi.
- And this is Bret.

03:14.041 --> 03:17.125
And this is...
Tech Support Advisor.

03:17.125 --> 03:20.041
She's putting all the new
computers in-- in the office.

03:20.041 --> 03:21.417
- Ahhh.
- Wow.

03:21.417 --> 03:24.250
Upgrading from
the old system now.

03:24.250 --> 03:25.917
25 years and it's
already obsolete, that one.

03:25.917 --> 03:28.333
- They move fast now,
don't they?
- Hmm, yes.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.083
Upgrading. Yeah.

03:30.083 --> 03:32.458
We're just having
a band meeting--
talking about upcoming gigs,

03:32.458 --> 03:33.959
- That sort of thing.
- Yeah, there's none.

03:33.959 --> 03:35.834
- It's pretty rock and roll...
- Right.

03:35.834 --> 03:38.041
- The sort of thing
we talk about--
- Well, I gotta go.

03:38.041 --> 03:40.959
- Um, it was nice
to meet you. Bye, guys.
- Jemaine: Yeah.

03:40.959 --> 03:43.959
- See you at 2:30.
- Right.

03:45.208 --> 03:46.667
( sighs )

03:46.667 --> 03:48.917
You all right, Murray?

03:48.917 --> 03:50.792
I'm in love.

03:50.792 --> 03:52.375
Who with?

03:52.375 --> 03:54.458
Her-- from Tech Support.

03:54.458 --> 03:55.917
What about your wife?

03:55.917 --> 03:57.583
- I'm separated.
- Are you?

03:57.583 --> 03:59.208
- Jemaine: Are you?
- Yes!

03:59.208 --> 04:00.667
You should have
told us something.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.291
I moved in with
you guys for a month.

04:02.291 --> 04:04.625
- I was upset, remember?
- Oh, is that why
you were there?

04:04.625 --> 04:05.959
Oh, come on, guys.

04:05.959 --> 04:07.625
- You talked me down
off the roof.
- Ah, yes yes.

04:07.625 --> 04:09.125
- Remember?
- No.

04:09.125 --> 04:11.041

04:11.041 --> 04:13.625
TV announcer:
And "The Dog Show"
takes a break next week...

04:13.625 --> 04:15.792
That was a great
episode of "The Dog Show."

04:15.792 --> 04:18.917
That guy was
so rude to me.

04:18.917 --> 04:21.458
- What guy?
- The-- the guy
at the fruit shop.

04:21.458 --> 04:24.041
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

04:24.041 --> 04:25.875
It's unbelievable.
He just insulted me.

04:25.875 --> 04:27.458
He was all right.

04:27.458 --> 04:30.166
No, he was racist.

04:30.166 --> 04:31.834
And the guy
told us to leave,

04:31.834 --> 04:34.291
said he wouldn't
serve our kind.

04:34.291 --> 04:36.959
- Yeah.
- That's racist
and a little bit rude.

04:36.959 --> 04:39.792
Yeah. Well, who knows
what he could have meant?

04:39.792 --> 04:42.208
TV Announcer:

New Zealand's 1.

04:42.208 --> 04:43.917

04:43.917 --> 04:46.083
we have an episode
of "What Have You
Done To My House?"

04:46.083 --> 04:49.667
And now it's time
for everyone's
favorite dragon, "Albi."

05:15.834 --> 05:20.041
- And so, all of the villagers
chased Albi the Racist Dragon
- ( villagers shouting )

05:20.041 --> 05:23.041
into a very cold
and very scary cave.

05:23.041 --> 05:26.041
It was so dark
and so scary in there

05:26.041 --> 05:29.709
that Albi began to cry--
dragon tears,

05:29.709 --> 05:31.250
which, as we all know,

05:31.250 --> 05:32.667
turn into jellybeans!

05:32.667 --> 05:36.917
Just then, he felt
a tiny hand on his tail.

05:36.917 --> 05:39.709
And he turned around
and who should it be

05:39.709 --> 05:41.792
but the badly burned
Albanian boy

05:41.792 --> 05:43.709
from the day before.

05:43.709 --> 05:47.542
What are you doing?
I thought I killed
you yesterday...

05:47.542 --> 05:50.709
Narrator:
...grumbled Albi
quite racistly.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.375
( speaking with thick accent )
Nah, no, Albi.

05:54.375 --> 05:57.542
You didn't kill me
with your dragon flames.

05:57.542 --> 05:59.792
I crawled to safety.

05:59.792 --> 06:03.250
But I was left
very badly disfigured...

06:03.250 --> 06:05.417
Narrator:
...laughed the boy.

06:05.417 --> 06:07.583
Why are you crying, Albi?

06:07.583 --> 06:09.583
Well, all of the villagers

06:09.583 --> 06:11.667
chased me into
this scary cave.

06:11.667 --> 06:14.083
I think it's
because I'm so racist.

06:14.083 --> 06:17.291
Get your hand off my tail,
you'll make it dirty.

06:17.291 --> 06:20.792
They didn't chase you here
because of your racism.

06:20.792 --> 06:22.458
They chased me here too

06:22.458 --> 06:25.959
when I became all
disfigured like this.

06:25.959 --> 06:27.500
They just don't like us

06:27.500 --> 06:31.875
because-- because
we're different to them.

06:31.875 --> 06:35.208
Narrator:
And at that,
Albi cried a single tear

06:35.208 --> 06:36.875
which turned
into a jellybean

06:36.875 --> 06:39.041
all the colors
of the rainbow.

06:39.041 --> 06:41.041
And suddenly,

06:41.041 --> 06:44.291

07:07.166 --> 07:09.375
Albi:
Goodbye. Goodbye.

07:09.375 --> 07:12.375
Are you crying over
the kids' show?

07:12.375 --> 07:14.458
Yes. So?

07:15.875 --> 07:18.959
- Are you crying?
- Yeah. So what?

07:22.083 --> 07:23.875
So he wouldn't
serve us, basically,

07:23.875 --> 07:25.542
just because we're
from New Zealand.

07:25.542 --> 07:27.083
Is that the norm?

07:27.083 --> 07:28.917
Well, you guys
are in America now

07:28.917 --> 07:30.625
and there's a lot
of "prejudism" here,

07:30.625 --> 07:32.333
especially towards
people like you.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.125
What do you mean
people like us?

07:34.125 --> 07:35.667
You know, the--
the English and whatnot.

07:35.667 --> 07:38.583
- Redcoats-- the oppressors.
- We're not English--

07:38.583 --> 07:40.417
Be that as it may, Jemaine,

07:40.417 --> 07:43.083
you're pretty much
the most disliked race
in this whole country.

07:43.083 --> 07:46.417
Wh-- wh-- what
about black people?

07:46.417 --> 07:48.041
They don't like you either.

07:48.041 --> 07:51.208
Neither do the Chinese,
the Asians,

07:51.208 --> 07:52.834
the Polish, Russian,

07:52.834 --> 07:55.959
Croatians,
even the Indians.

07:55.959 --> 07:58.917
Yeah, but, Dave,
you're Indian.
You hate us?

07:58.917 --> 08:01.166
Yeah.

08:01.166 --> 08:04.000
Sometimes.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.583
But you're
our best friend.

08:06.583 --> 08:08.250
I know.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.542
( doors hissing )

08:28.291 --> 08:30.250
You can't sit there,
gotta go to the back.

08:34.208 --> 08:36.917
I'm sorry.
Back of the bus.

08:43.917 --> 08:47.917
Why don't you get an apple
from someone who doesn't
hate our country, Bret?

08:48.917 --> 08:50.875
Thanks so much.

08:52.125 --> 08:53.875
Excuse me, I'd like
to buy this apple, please.

08:53.875 --> 08:56.083
( sighs )
New Zealander--

08:56.083 --> 08:58.458
Stop touching my fruit!
It's not allowed.

08:58.458 --> 09:00.083
What's wrong
with New Zealanders?

09:00.083 --> 09:02.208
Hey, Neila!
Can we bleach this one up?

09:02.208 --> 09:03.625
It's been infected!

09:03.625 --> 09:05.417
I wanna buy that.
I'll pay for it.

09:05.417 --> 09:08.375
No, not this apple,
New Zealandy.

09:08.375 --> 09:10.125
You can buy apples
from over there--

09:10.125 --> 09:11.625
my special
New Zealand section.

09:11.625 --> 09:13.375
- $10 apiece.
- ( dog yelping )

09:13.375 --> 09:15.417
There's a dog
in the New Zealand section.

09:15.417 --> 09:18.125
Well, it's
for dogs from America

09:18.125 --> 09:20.125
and people
from New Zealand.

09:20.125 --> 09:21.625
Yeah, you're being racist.

09:21.625 --> 09:23.458
How dare you
call me a racist!

09:23.458 --> 09:26.041
He doesn't mean racist.
He means xenophobic.

09:26.041 --> 09:27.834
Oh. Well, you're
being xenophobic.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.792
You know what?
Just get lost,
New Zealanders.

09:29.792 --> 09:31.792
I'm not going
anywhere till I get
a Red Delicious and a banana.

09:31.792 --> 09:34.083
You want a brown delicious
to the face?

09:34.083 --> 09:36.083
No.

09:36.083 --> 09:37.875
You wanna make
trouble for me, huh?

09:37.875 --> 09:41.166
I don't. Bret was sort of
driving this situation.

09:41.166 --> 09:43.458
We're not going anywhere
till we get an apple.

09:43.458 --> 09:45.375
I'm gonna count to 10.

09:50.792 --> 09:52.667
You-- are you
counting in your head?

09:52.667 --> 09:54.500
- Yeah.
- What are you up to?

09:54.500 --> 09:56.625
- Seven.
- Oh.

09:58.041 --> 09:59.667
Yeah, get your shitty bikes
and get out of here

Uh, yeah. Um, I just
can't seem to turn it on.

embarrassed to admit this,

12:54.500 --> 12:57.834
but I can't really put my
emotions into-- into words.

12:57.834 --> 12:59.333
So I've decided
to use lyrics.

12:59.333 --> 13:02.750
Well, this--
they're also words.

13:02.750 --> 13:05.125
Oh, well can you

13:05.125 --> 13:06.792

adding some more words?

13:31.208 --> 13:32.875
I don't know. I don't want
to make it too convoluted.

13:32.875 --> 13:34.875
You probably want
more than one word.

13:34.875 --> 13:36.333
How about this?

13:36.333 --> 13:38.709

it brings up emotions for me.

you could do?

15:33.750 --> 15:36.917
Inject strychnine
into a piece of his fruit.

15:36.917 --> 15:38.500
Then when a customer dies,

15:38.500 --> 15:40.375
the C.I.A. will trace it
back to the vendor

15:40.375 --> 15:43.125

straight to the big house--

15:43.125 --> 15:46.291

- No, it wouldn't work.
It wouldn't work.
- No, so?

16:03.083 --> 16:05.709
Well, sometimes what I do

16:05.709 --> 16:08.375
is I think mean thoughts
about the person.

16:09.625 --> 16:11.625
- How do they know?
- They don't know.

16:11.625 --> 16:13.375
I know, that's why
I didn't suggest it.

16:14.458 --> 16:16.834
So what you guys need
is something...

16:16.834 --> 16:19.375
a little more subtle
than framing him for murder,

16:19.375 --> 16:21.875
which I actually think
is still a great idea,

16:21.875 --> 16:23.083
but more obvious

16:23.083 --> 16:24.792
than thinking
mean thoughts about him.

No, that's not the bird,

That's a little bird.

No, that just
looks stupid.

Yeah, but try putting
some wings on your bird.

18:02.041 --> 18:06.166
- There we go.
That's much nicer.
- But you don't wanna be nice.

18:06.166 --> 18:09.125
What if-- what if
you were doing that one
and then I snuck up behind you

- Don't ever--

- And what's offensive
about that?

18:18.834 --> 18:20.333
Because, you Scottish freak,

18:20.333 --> 18:23.125
it's your way of saying,
"Hey, you better not
disrespect me, man,

disrespect you."

18:26.875 --> 18:29.166

19:49.125 --> 19:50.750
How dare you come here

19:50.750 --> 19:53.083
and give me those
offensive hand gestures
at my fruit stand?

19:53.083 --> 19:56.000
It was either
this or getting you
sent into Alcatraz.

19:56.000 --> 19:58.208
How dare you treat us
like secondhand citizens?

19:58.208 --> 20:00.083
It doesn't matter
what country someone's from

20:00.083 --> 20:03.625
or what they look like
or the color of their skin.

20:03.625 --> 20:05.750
It doesn't matter
what they smell like.

20:05.750 --> 20:08.291
Or whether they spell words
slightly differently--

20:08.291 --> 20:10.041
some would say
more correctly.

20:10.041 --> 20:12.250
- Yeah?
- Let me finish.

20:13.125 --> 20:14.709
I'm a person.

20:14.709 --> 20:16.291
- Bret's a person.
- Yep.

20:16.291 --> 20:19.750
You're a person.
That person over
there is a person.

20:19.750 --> 20:23.917
And each person
deserves to be
treated like a person.

20:25.083 --> 20:26.542
That's a great speech.

20:26.542 --> 20:28.333
Too bad New Zealanders
are a bunch of cocky a-holes

20:28.333 --> 20:30.875
descended from criminals
and retarded monkeys.

20:30.875 --> 20:32.542
No, you're thinking
of Australians.

20:32.542 --> 20:34.458
- Yeah, that's Australians.
- That's Australians.

20:34.458 --> 20:36.000
No no no.
New Zealanders.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.709
Throw another shrimp
on the barbie.

20:37.709 --> 20:39.792
- Ride around on your
kangaroos all day.
- No no no no.

20:39.792 --> 20:42.208
- That's Australians.
- You're thinking of
Australians, that's not us.

20:42.208 --> 20:45.291
I've totally confused you
with Australians.

20:45.291 --> 20:47.792
- I-- I feel terrible.
- Jemaine: Oh, no. Oh, no.

20:47.792 --> 20:49.792
Your accents--
they're just kinda similar.

20:49.792 --> 20:51.625
The accents
are completely different.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.542
Th-- They're like,
"Where's the car?"

20:53.542 --> 20:55.250
and we're like,
"Where's the car?"

20:55.250 --> 20:57.166
You know what? Hey, ha--
have some of my fruit.

20:57.166 --> 20:58.875
Please, I feel terrible.

20:58.875 --> 21:00.834
- Do you want that
Red Delicious still?
- Oh, I would love

21:00.834 --> 21:02.834
- the Red Delicious, yeah.
- Well, this Red Delicious
is on me.

21:02.834 --> 21:04.834
- You still want that banana?
- Bret: Thank you.

21:04.834 --> 21:07.458
- Jemaine: I'd love
the banana.
- Here. Here you go.

21:07.458 --> 21:09.166
- Oh, that's so crazy.
- I'm Sinjay.

21:09.166 --> 21:10.792
- I'm Jemaine.
Good to meet you.
- Bret.

21:10.792 --> 21:13.000
Neila. You can--
You can uncover your eyes.
