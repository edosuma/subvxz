11:51.377 --> 11:53.379
Cousin, cousin, look!

This is the couch
where Wayne sits!

11:58.251 --> 12:00.220
Cousin, look! Look!

12:00.253 --> 12:03.456
This is the piano where Wayne
tinkles on the ivories.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.495
Red roses! Red Roses!

12:09.530 --> 12:11.064
You must be the Blue Lady.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.287
Alright, that’s it!

12:34.320 --> 12:35.789
You are over‐excited.

12:35.822 --> 12:36.923
‐Cousin, cousin!
‐We’re outta here.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.959
I‐I saw him. He look at me!

12:38.992 --> 12:41.361
But, I‐I was just a little
overwhelmed but I’m fine now.

12:41.394 --> 12:42.529
‐Oh, you are.
‐I’m fine now, I’m okay.

12:42.563 --> 12:45.365
Alright, how many fingers
am I holding up?

12:45.398 --> 12:47.367
Ah, gentlemen, Wayne would
like to meet you now.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.269
Oh, alright, yeah...

12:50.270 --> 12:53.439
[indistinct chatter]

12:53.473 --> 12:55.008
Wayne, these are the gentlemen
I told you about.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.476
This is Larry Appleton.

12:56.510 --> 12:58.545
‐Nice to meet you, Larry.
‐Very nice to meet you.

12:58.579 --> 13:00.480
And this is Balki Bartokomous.

13:06.853 --> 13:08.088
He skipped lunch.

13:10.591 --> 13:12.526
[grunting]

13:15.095 --> 13:16.096
Thank you.

13:17.430 --> 13:21.301
Balki, it’s so nice to meet you.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.504
You’re such an incredible
young man.

13:25.371 --> 13:27.307
Wayne! Wayne! Wayne!

13:27.340 --> 13:29.042
Wayne! Wayne! Wayne!

13:29.075 --> 13:31.945
Wayne,
t‐the photographer’s ready.

13:31.978 --> 13:35.582
‐Oh, oh‐oh!
‐I’ll be right back, Balki.

13:35.616 --> 13:39.119
Honest! I’m coming,
I’m coming right back.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.423
Daddy, don’t you walk so fast.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.125
Alright!

13:47.528 --> 13:50.196
Cousin! Cousin! Cousin!
Isn’t he wonderful?

13:50.230 --> 13:51.632
Isn’t he terrific?

13:51.665 --> 13:54.367
Why is he yelling at me?

13:54.400 --> 13:56.002
Uh, why, why is Wayne
yelling at you?

13:56.036 --> 13:57.270
‐Why is Wayne yelling at you?
‐Yeah.

13:57.303 --> 13:59.239
Well, well, well, uh, you know.

13:59.272 --> 14:01.307
Uh, probably, uh,
you know, singing

14:01.341 --> 14:04.177
in front of a large orchestra

14:04.210 --> 14:07.213
all those years has, uh,
just made him a little...

14:07.247 --> 14:09.015
...hard of, uh, hearing.

14:11.251 --> 14:12.352
Yeah.

14:14.087 --> 14:15.355
That’s it.

14:15.388 --> 14:18.091
Poor man.

14:18.124 --> 14:20.994
Balki, I’m so sorry
that we were interrupted here!

14:22.563 --> 14:26.567
Wayne! I’ve waited
all my life to meet you.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.902
I, I have been
a fan of yours since

14:28.935 --> 14:31.471
I was knee‐high
to a yak pup.

14:31.505 --> 14:35.976
And my mother was practically
raised on your music!

14:36.009 --> 14:39.379
To me there is no other singer!

14:39.412 --> 14:43.316
Thank you, Balki! It’s fans like
you that make it all worthwhile!

14:43.349 --> 14:45.686
Oh, go on with you!

14:45.719 --> 14:48.121
‐No, I’m serious.
‐Oh, go on with you!

14:48.154 --> 14:49.923
‐Oh, I’m telling you the truth.
‐Oh, come...

14:53.059 --> 14:55.962
Balki, I just want you
to know how honored I am

14:55.996 --> 14:57.631
that you chose my show

14:57.664 --> 15:00.033
to be the last show
that you hear

15:00.066 --> 15:02.135
before you lose your hearing.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.241
What?

15:09.976 --> 15:11.978
I want you to know
how honored I am

15:12.012 --> 15:13.947
that you chose my show

15:13.980 --> 15:16.282
to be the last show
that you hear

15:16.316 --> 15:18.552
before you lose your hearing!

15:22.222 --> 15:23.356
What?

15:26.492 --> 15:27.561
It’s going fast.

15:29.495 --> 15:31.064
I’m glad he caught
the early show.

15:34.234 --> 15:37.604
You’re a very brave young man.

15:37.638 --> 15:39.540
‐He’s blessed to have you.
‐Uh, yes, he is.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.342
[indistinct chatter]

15:57.257 --> 15:59.325
What have you done?

16:02.696 --> 16:05.031
I told Wayne
you were going deaf.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.038
Why didn’t you tell me sooner?

16:20.714 --> 16:21.982
Balki...

16:24.518 --> 16:25.552
...I wanted to tell you sooner.

16:25.586 --> 16:26.620
[sobbing]

16:26.653 --> 16:28.421
Alright, alright, alright, no!

16:28.454 --> 16:31.057
No, no, Balki.

16:31.091 --> 16:32.659
Balki, you’re not going deaf.

16:32.693 --> 16:34.695
‐What?
‐You’re not going deaf.

16:34.728 --> 16:36.162
‐What?
‐I made it up.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.533
Just, I‐I, that’s what I told
Wayne’s people

16:39.566 --> 16:41.201
so that I could get
tickets to the show.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.170
[indistinct chatter]

16:46.339 --> 16:49.409
You, you lied to Wayne?

16:51.845 --> 16:55.115
Is nothing sacred to you?

16:55.148 --> 16:57.483
Balki, you feel great
’cause you got to meet Wayne.

16:57.518 --> 16:58.719
Wayne feels great
’cause he helped you.

16:58.752 --> 17:00.353
There’s no harm done.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.756
No harm done?

17:02.789 --> 17:06.727
Cousin, you, you took
the, the most...

17:06.760 --> 17:11.565
...thrilling moment of my life
and you tarnished it with a lie.

17:11.598 --> 17:14.067
[indistinct chatter]

17:14.099 --> 17:16.336
Could I please
have your attention?

17:16.368 --> 17:18.438
Could I please
have your attention?

17:18.471 --> 17:21.541
We have someone very
special here tonight.

17:23.609 --> 17:26.646
We have someone very
special here tonight...

17:29.516 --> 17:32.252
...that I would like you
all to meet.

17:32.285 --> 17:35.255
It isn’t very often
in my lifetime

17:35.288 --> 17:38.725
that I’ve seen
this kind of courage.

17:38.759 --> 17:40.627
Would you please give
a big round of applause‐‐

17:40.661 --> 17:42.763
Uh, wait a minute,
wait a minute.

17:42.796 --> 17:44.798
I‐I can’t let you
go through with this.

17:46.567 --> 17:48.569
The, the man you’re
about to introduce

17:48.602 --> 17:51.204
is not what he appears to be.

17:51.237 --> 17:55.509
And, and it’s not his fault,
it’s mine.

17:55.542 --> 17:59.680
I made the whole thing up so he
could get tickets to the show.

18:00.814 --> 18:03.249
And I‐I’ve ruined
this entire evening

18:03.283 --> 18:07.554
for someone who,
who means a lot to me.

18:07.588 --> 18:09.489
And, I’m, I’m sorry.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.661
You should be
ashamed of yourself

18:14.695 --> 18:16.429
for impersonating a war hero.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.333
Escort him out!

18:31.177 --> 18:32.646
Alright, not him! Not him!

18:32.679 --> 18:35.582
I‐I‐I lied about

18:35.616 --> 18:37.417
Balki’s hearing problem.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.520
Oh, though I can’t vouch
for the old guy.

18:40.721 --> 18:42.756
Balki, I‐I am, I am so sorry.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.425
Can you...
Can you ever forgive me?

18:45.458 --> 18:48.228
Yes, cousin, I can forgive you
but I just don’t wanna be seen

18:48.261 --> 18:50.330
talking to you right now.

18:50.363 --> 18:52.265
[dramatic music]

18:58.572 --> 19:01.675
(Larry)
’Balki, I am so sorry
about last night.’

19:01.708 --> 19:03.810
I mean, your, your whole life
you’ve dreamed of meeting Wayne

19:03.844 --> 19:05.646
and, and I ruined it.

19:05.679 --> 19:07.614
No, you didn’t ruin it.
Cousin, Come on.

19:07.648 --> 19:12.619
It really, I met him.
It was wonderful, wonderful.

19:12.653 --> 19:13.654
Hi, guys!

19:15.956 --> 19:17.157
[giggles]

19:23.564 --> 19:24.565
I’ll get him.

19:25.599 --> 19:26.600
He skipped breakfast.

19:28.569 --> 19:31.505
[grunting]

19:33.006 --> 19:37.678
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne Newton is,
is standing in the room with me.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.847
I‐I guess you...

19:40.881 --> 19:43.383
...came up here to throw us out.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.652
Well, of course not.
Don’t be ridiculous.

19:50.591 --> 19:53.627
Actually, I was thinking,
and it finally dawned on me...

19:53.660 --> 19:56.930
...that you’re the Balki that’s
been writing me every week

19:56.963 --> 19:59.299
for the last fifteen years,
aren’t you?

19:59.332 --> 20:01.802
‐Yes!
‐How’s mama?

20:01.835 --> 20:03.870
Oh, she’s great! She’s great!

20:03.904 --> 20:05.606
Do you remember,
I wrote to you and I told you

20:05.639 --> 20:07.440
that she was going
back to school?

20:07.473 --> 20:09.810
‐Yes!
‐Well, she aced her midterms.

20:09.843 --> 20:11.578
And she made
the cheerleading squad.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.882
‐Get out of the city!
‐Yes, it’s true!

20:15.916 --> 20:18.585
[laughing]

20:18.619 --> 20:20.887
And you’re Cousin Larry, huh?

20:20.921 --> 20:22.889
Well, I must admit that
you’ve lived up to everything

20:22.923 --> 20:24.490
that Balki’s written about you.

20:27.661 --> 20:29.663
Well, thank you, Wayne.

20:29.696 --> 20:31.431
‐May I call you "Wayne?"
‐No.

20:34.434 --> 20:36.002
I‐I understand.

20:36.036 --> 20:38.438
[chuckles]
Lighten up, Larry.
I was just kiddin’.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.606
He does get tensed, doesn’t he?

20:39.640 --> 20:41.341
Oh, yeah, he’s quite,
quite tense.

20:42.643 --> 20:44.410
Actually the reason I came here

20:44.444 --> 20:45.879
was to invite you guys
back to the show

20:45.912 --> 20:47.648
as my guests tonight.

20:47.681 --> 20:49.716
’Cause I wanna do a very
special song for you, Balki.

20:51.685 --> 20:55.355
You...w‐want to do
a song for me?

20:55.388 --> 20:56.489
Yes.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.459
What song is it?

20:59.492 --> 21:00.861
I can’t tell you,
it’s a surprise.

21:00.894 --> 21:03.597
‐Oh, please tell me.
‐It’s a surprise.

21:03.630 --> 21:06.299
‐Is it "CC Rider?"
‐You’ll hear tonight.

21:06.332 --> 21:08.635
‐"Hungry years?"
‐It’s a surprise!

21:08.669 --> 21:10.470
‐"Moon River?"
‐"Andy Williams."

21:10.504 --> 21:11.872
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

21:11.905 --> 21:15.008
[mumbling]

21:15.041 --> 21:16.743
Will you please tell me
what it is?

21:16.777 --> 21:18.879
Please, I‐I can’t wait!
I can’t stand it!

21:18.912 --> 21:21.014
I’m gonna explode if you don’t
tell me what it is!

21:21.047 --> 21:22.649
Okay, "Danke Schoen."

21:26.687 --> 21:28.488

21:28.522 --> 21:31.357
Ow! Ow, ow, ow!

21:31.391 --> 21:32.726
The ring. The ring. The ring.

21:38.832 --> 21:40.901
You know, I just had
the most beautiful dream

21:40.934 --> 21:43.369
that‐that, that you say
that you were going to

21:43.403 --> 21:45.105
to sing "Danke Schoen" for me.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.472
I am.

21:47.741 --> 21:48.942
Oh!

21:48.975 --> 21:50.711
Oh, oh!

21:51.477 --> 21:54.347
’Oh! Oh!’

21:54.380 --> 21:57.584
Listen, Wayne, I‐I’m sorry
about all the...

21:57.618 --> 21:58.785
...lying.

21:58.819 --> 21:59.986
Ah, don’t worry about it, Larry.

22:00.020 --> 22:01.054
I was thinking about it

22:01.087 --> 22:02.789
and I was really
kind of touched

22:02.823 --> 22:04.357
that you went through
all that trouble

22:04.390 --> 22:05.959
to get tickets to the show.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.360
See you later, huh?
