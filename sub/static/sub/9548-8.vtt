- What do you think?
- It's very nice.

00:15.726 --> 00:17.981
It's too nice.
I mean, for us.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.387
Sure you don't want to take this to an
auction house? Maybe sotheby's?

00:21.507 --> 00:22.483
I can't.

00:24.150 --> 00:25.670
I don't want any publicity.

00:27.408 --> 00:29.759
Well, we might be able to find a buyer.

00:30.517 --> 00:32.695
We'll need some time.
Maybe a week?

00:33.223 --> 00:34.032
A week.

00:35.944 --> 00:38.909
Okay, I guess I will
call you in a week, then.

00:39.906 --> 00:43.012
And if you do find a buyer,
let them know that I've got

00:43.229 --> 00:45.312
some ther items that
I'm looking to sell.

00:46.478 --> 00:48.602
A whole house full, actually.
Thank you.

00:50.044 --> 00:51.436
Do you need an umbrella?

00:55.219 --> 00:57.625
Sweetheart,
are you okay?

00:59.682 --> 01:01.992
Yeah, yeah.
I thought I saw my husband.

01:03.007 --> 01:04.700
I guess I'm just a little jumpy.

01:05.437 --> 01:06.522
Thank you again.

01:07.102 --> 01:08.260
I'll be in touch.

01:15.061 --> 01:16.582
That girl's in trouble.

01:17.170 --> 01:18.998
Don't you know who that was?

01:19.554 --> 01:20.950
She's very famous.

01:21.389 --> 01:24.133
- What's her name? The actress.
- What actress?

01:24.253 --> 01:26.480
The famous actress.
What's her name?

01:27.004 --> 01:29.855
She's married to a.
A real estate big shot.

01:31.390 --> 01:32.629
I was just reading.

01:33.307 --> 01:35.019

Okay.

02:55.921 --> 02:57.647
Driver's side door was open.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.319
Found the key on the ground,
and we found these.

03:00.439 --> 03:02.062
This is a piece of her jacket.

03:02.509 --> 03:05.494
And a broken fingernail, it was,
in the door well.

03:05.879 --> 03:08.446
- Everything but the body?
- Yeah, look at. Hey, look!

03:09.436 --> 03:10.827
It's a double rainbow.

03:13.317 --> 03:15.655
I haven't seen one
of those since I was a kid.

03:16.221 --> 03:17.307
Look at that.

03:17.729 --> 03:19.748
It's okay, Mr. Monk,
it stopped raining.

03:27.418 --> 03:30.065
- Oh, my god. Look at that.
- What is it?

03:30.436 --> 03:33.640
It's a double rainbow.
I've never seen one before.

03:35.559 --> 03:38.502
- Aren't you gonna look?
- I believe you. It's a double rainbow.

03:38.668 --> 03:40.201
Yeah, that must be her car.

03:40.725 --> 03:42.996
- But, Mr. Monk, you have to look.
- Why?

03:43.116 --> 03:45.676
Because it's beautiful and it's rare.

03:45.804 --> 03:48.244
- Don't you have any sense of wonder?
- Sure, I do.

03:49.101 --> 03:50.967
I wonder where the missing woman went.

03:51.362 --> 03:52.998
Mr. Monk, please just turn around.

03:53.328 --> 03:56.294
Why, is this your rainbow?
Did you commission this rainbow?

03:56.414 --> 03:59.302
No, it's your rainbow, at least it
should be. Come on. Turn around.

04:01.745 --> 04:04.855
- What do you think?
- Not really a double rainbow, is it?

04:04.983 --> 04:06.869
"Double" implies equal.

04:07.202 --> 04:10.249
- The top one is 40% smaller.
- Don't you see that?

04:10.478 --> 04:12.944
Don't you see how beautiful that is?

04:14.783 --> 04:15.779
I'm trying.

04:17.718 --> 04:19.507
I just wish they were even.

04:20.583 --> 04:22.836
- I'm so sorry.
- Sorry about what?

04:23.083 --> 04:24.271
Sorry for you.

04:24.870 --> 04:26.634
You'll never know what you're missing.

04:31.555 --> 04:33.804
- Hey, sorry we're late.
- Did you guys see the rainbow?

04:33.932 --> 04:35.887
Yeah, I didn't get it.
What's going on?

04:36.549 --> 04:38.848
It could be big.
Big and messy.

04:38.968 --> 04:40.936
Car belongs to Sally Larkin.

04:41.497 --> 04:44.779
You wouldn't know this, but she was in a
couple of movies five or ten years ago.

04:44.899 --> 04:47.412
I was just reading about her.
She's going through a bad divorce.

04:47.532 --> 04:50.085
- "Bad" doesn't get any worse.
- Who's the husband?

04:50.205 --> 04:51.206
Aaron Larkin.

04:51.326 --> 04:54.265
Guy's a gazillionaire. He owns half
the city, including Fisherman's wharf.

04:55.090 --> 04:56.419
What was she doing here?

04:56.541 --> 04:59.520
She was selling her jewelry.
Or she was trying to. She was in

04:59.929 --> 05:02.045
this store over here.
She goes in, she tells the owners

05:02.165 --> 05:04.622
that she thinks she's being
followed by her husband.

05:04.742 --> 05:07.067
She comes back to her car
around 8:30 Pm,

05:07.540 --> 05:09.976
- they say they hear a scream.
- 8:30 Pm.?

05:10.096 --> 05:12.222
I know.
Local boys booted it.

05:12.342 --> 05:14.630
They didn't file the report
until this morning.

05:33.966 --> 05:36.140
Hey, buddy!
What's goin'on?

05:38.075 --> 05:38.928
Natalie?

05:40.693 --> 05:42.260
You look fantastic.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.329
Well, thank you, Harold.
I think.

05:45.809 --> 05:48.752
- You get out of bed looking like that?
- Harold, what are you doing here?

05:48.872 --> 05:51.289
I'm just jogging by, enjoying the day.

05:51.717 --> 05:53.832
I love the city after it rains.

05:54.013 --> 05:55.982
- It smells like perfume.
- Does it?

05:56.599 --> 05:58.350
Have you seen the double rainbow?

05:58.571 --> 06:00.778
Yeah, yeah, I know.
They're not even.

06:01.395 --> 06:03.225
Really?
I didn't notice.

06:03.483 --> 06:04.876
Right,
me neither.

06:05.223 --> 06:08.814
Look, I don't want to interrupt
your work. I know you're busy.

06:08.942 --> 06:10.399
It is another murder?

06:10.710 --> 06:12.666
You know what, Harold?
Maybe.

06:14.579 --> 06:16.151
They're lucky to have you.

06:17.088 --> 06:18.392
Listen to this man.

06:18.512 --> 06:20.399
- He is a genius.
- He doesn't mean that.

06:20.519 --> 06:22.136
- You don't mean that.
- Sure, I do.

06:22.727 --> 06:23.584
I do.

06:24.703 --> 06:27.004
I don't play that
competitive game anymore.

06:27.710 --> 06:30.913
That was an emotional dead end.
I have a new therapist.

06:31.795 --> 06:35.271
- I'm in a whole different place.
- You, you have a new guy?

06:35.941 --> 06:36.823
He's great.

06:38.310 --> 06:39.882
Yeah, my new guy's great too.

06:40.237 --> 06:42.703
His first name is neven.
It's a palindrome.

06:44.035 --> 06:45.692
- I guess it is.
- It is.

06:45.973 --> 06:46.765
It is.

06:47.844 --> 06:49.572
I know that stuff is important to you.

06:49.692 --> 06:53.084
I guess I'm just a little
more result-oriented these days.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.484
His name is Climan.

06:54.727 --> 06:55.966
Lawrence Climan.

06:56.248 --> 06:57.417
Give him a call.

06:57.598 --> 06:58.735
Hypnotherapist?

06:59.659 --> 07:00.843
He's a hypnotist?

07:02.068 --> 07:03.001
Worked for me.

07:03.459 --> 07:05.364
Yeah, i.
I guess it did.

07:07.057 --> 07:07.786
Anyway,

07:08.949 --> 07:09.850
Good luk.

07:10.116 --> 07:11.575
See you around campus.

07:12.546 --> 07:14.872
I just cannot get over that rainbow!

07:15.785 --> 07:18.405
It just makes you feel glad to be alive,
doesn't it?

07:18.536 --> 07:20.149
I love this song!

07:20.269 --> 07:22.419
<i>16 girls
standin'in a row one</i>

07:22.539 --> 07:24.695
<i>one says "hi,"
the other says "hello".</i>

07:36.149 --> 07:38.551
- I'll tell mr. Larkin you're here.
- Thank you.

07:39.957 --> 07:40.672
Gum?

07:41.350 --> 07:42.316
Yeah, sure.

07:42.900 --> 07:43.973
Here, try this.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.158
No.
No, thank you.

07:51.613 --> 07:52.880
What the hell is this?

07:53.992 --> 07:55.943
- "Disher-Mint"?
- Yeah, I made it myself.

07:57.883 --> 07:59.796
- You made the gum?
- Yeah, from a kit.

07:59.916 --> 08:01.680
I got it online.
In my basement,

08:02.035 --> 08:04.387
I'm experimenting with a bunch
of different flavors right now.

08:05.124 --> 08:06.926
- Guess what this one is.
- Tar?

08:08.362 --> 08:10.202
No, it's supposed to be diet blueberry.

08:10.771 --> 08:13.515
- Not enough citric acid?
- Hell. Where'd it go?

08:13.635 --> 08:14.364
Hello.

08:15.770 --> 08:18.052
Aaron Larkin.
I've been expecting you.

08:18.236 --> 08:20.641
Hi, I'm Leland Stottlemeyer.
This is Lieutenant Disher,

08:20.761 --> 08:22.844
Natalie Teeger,
and Adrian Monk.

08:23.450 --> 08:25.683
Mr. Monk, your reputation precedes you.

08:25.803 --> 08:27.707
I'm assuming this is about my wife.

08:28.453 --> 08:30.306
She hasn't turned up yet.

08:31.220 --> 08:32.447
No, sir.
She has not.

08:32.690 --> 08:35.270
That's horrible timing, really.

08:35.996 --> 08:38.629
If she'd gone missing on our wedding
day, might have saved me six years

08:38.764 --> 08:39.568
of misery.

08:40.436 --> 08:42.724
Mr. Larkin, when was the
last time you saw your wife?

08:42.845 --> 08:46.022
It was yesterday morning,
she was going shopping as usual...

08:46.154 --> 08:48.858
- Are you okay?
- It's driving me crazy.

08:49.334 --> 08:51.119
- How did he do it?
- Who?

08:51.651 --> 08:52.456
Harold!

08:52.894 --> 08:55.095
Did you see him?
He looked so

08:56.303 --> 08:57.466
not unhappy.

08:57.806 --> 08:59.718
And he wasn't acting, either.
I could tell.

08:59.838 --> 09:02.869
Excuse me, i'm sorry to interrupt you.
But this guy says that,

09:03.761 --> 09:06.138
he never left the house.
That he was here all night.

09:06.397 --> 09:08.558
He's lying.
What if it really works?

09:08.679 --> 09:10.616
What?
What, hypnotism?

09:10.814 --> 09:12.752
Mr. Monk,
just because Harold seems to be doing

09:12.872 --> 09:14.807
a little better
doesn't mean it'll work for you.

09:14.927 --> 09:16.981
I mean, everybody's different.
Especially you.

09:17.118 --> 09:18.545
Excuse me again, sorry.

09:19.172 --> 09:21.418
- How do we know he's lying?
- The umbrella.

09:21.912 --> 09:24.540
Look, maybe it's real.
It says "certified."

09:25.151 --> 09:26.974
What does that mean?
Certified by who?

09:27.094 --> 09:28.171
- Whom.
- Whom.

09:28.291 --> 09:31.679
Mr. Monk, I just read this article on
hypnotism. It's not even medical.

09:31.822 --> 09:35.020
- It's a short cut.
- Sorry, excuse me, one more thing.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.971
What about the umbrella?

09:37.116 --> 09:38.904
The green one on the end.
It's monogrammed,

09:39.024 --> 09:41.387
it's obviously his.
It's still wet from the rain.

09:42.138 --> 09:43.195
Right, thank you.

09:43.761 --> 09:46.833
What's the matter with short cuts?
Short cuts are your friend.

09:47.147 --> 09:49.845
They get you where you wanna go.
Only faster.

09:49.965 --> 09:51.812
Mr. Monk, we need to call Dr. Bell.

09:52.160 --> 09:54.970
All Dr. Bell wants to do is talk.
There's Dr. Bell.

09:55.306 --> 09:57.681
"Blah, blah. "Tell me about your mother.
Yack, yack, yack.

09:57.801 --> 10:00.575
"How does that make you feel?
Words, words, words."

10:00.821 --> 10:03.599
- That's your impression of Dr. Bell?
- I'm sick of talking.

10:03.719 --> 10:06.440
I've been talking for 11 years.
I want to get better.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.364
I wanna look at rainbows, and.

10:09.484 --> 10:11.846
I know you do, Mr. Monk.
I know you do. But this is the thing:

10:11.966 --> 10:13.629
we don't know
anything about this guy.

10:13.749 --> 10:15.695
We don't even know
if he's a real doctor.

10:15.824 --> 10:16.889
Promise me.

10:17.123 --> 10:19.995
Promise me you will not call
him until we talk to Dr. Bell.

10:22.939 --> 10:24.640
- Promise.
- Yeah, all right.

10:46.392 --> 10:49.412
<i>Sorry for you.
You'll never know what you're missing.</i>

10:53.950 --> 10:56.454
<i>I just cannot get over that rainbow!</i>

10:57.223 --> 11:00.057
<i>It just makes you feel glad to be alive,
doesn't it?</i>

11:17.544 --> 11:18.584
<i>Doctor's office.</i>

11:19.114 --> 11:21.703
Is this Dr. Climan's office?

11:22.197 --> 11:23.746
<i>This is his answering service.</i>

11:25.077 --> 11:26.740
I'd like to make an appointment.

11:39.130 --> 11:42.267
I need you to relax.

11:43.214 --> 11:43.931
Okay.

11:44.184 --> 11:45.942
I think you could do better than that.

11:46.731 --> 11:50.510
Here, I need you to get
comfortable, okay?

11:50.892 --> 11:53.814
- Yeah.
- I need you to Un-clench.

11:57.220 --> 11:58.969
I need you to open every door.

12:00.012 --> 12:01.807
Open
every door.

12:03.621 --> 12:04.621
There.

12:05.491 --> 12:06.285
Okay.

12:06.636 --> 12:08.061
What are you thinking about?

12:09.247 --> 12:11.299
- Harold Krenshaw.
- Okay, okay.

12:11.419 --> 12:14.217
Forget about Harold Krenshaw.
He doesn't exist.

12:15.674 --> 12:19.052
- He doesn't exist.
- He doesn't. He doesn't exist.

12:19.614 --> 12:22.409
I know. I know you have doubts.
You're a skeptical man.

12:23.028 --> 12:25.423
But
you came to me for a reason.

12:25.628 --> 12:27.537
You have to make a leap here.

12:28.094 --> 12:28.793
Yeah?

12:30.211 --> 12:32.630
Leap,
and a net will appear.

12:33.540 --> 12:34.579
Who's Annette?

12:35.485 --> 12:38.112
No, Anet,
to catch you.

12:38.909 --> 12:39.910
You're safe.

12:40.967 --> 12:41.911
Okay?

12:43.725 --> 12:44.929
All your doubts,

12:45.947 --> 12:47.286
All your fears,

12:47.742 --> 12:50.378
are falling away.
They're falling away.

12:50.990 --> 12:53.275
Can you feel them?
Can you feel them falling away?

12:53.411 --> 12:55.357
Don't say anything.
Just nod your head.

12:55.603 --> 12:56.813
I'm nodding my head.

12:56.983 --> 12:59.067
But don't say you're nodding
your head. Just

12:59.187 --> 13:01.426
- nod your head.
- I'm nodding my head.

13:01.546 --> 13:03.772
No, don't say you're nodding your head.
Just nod your head.

13:03.892 --> 13:06.204
- I am nodding my head.
- Okay, forget the nodding.

13:12.369 --> 13:15.266
We are going to take
a little trip together. You and i.

13:16.309 --> 13:18.278
We are going

13:18.683 --> 13:20.365
back in time.

13:25.513 --> 13:28.802
Going back before
the pain.

13:29.985 --> 13:30.889
Before

13:31.903 --> 13:32.867
the fear.

13:33.958 --> 13:35.356
Before the fear.

13:36.577 --> 13:37.333
Good.

13:39.437 --> 13:41.251
You're with
Trudy now.

13:45.652 --> 13:47.296
No.
Trudy.

13:48.062 --> 13:51.098
I'm gonna lose her again.
I'm gonna lose her again!

13:51.218 --> 13:55.158
Okay, okay. We're moving on.
We're, we're. We're moving back

13:55.502 --> 13:56.750
a little further.

13:57.628 --> 13:59.991
Now,
you're in high school.

14:01.551 --> 14:03.916
Third period.
It's gym class.

14:04.133 --> 14:08.041
They're gonna make me climb that rope.
I can't climb that rope.

14:08.161 --> 14:11.388
I can't, please don't
make me climb that rope.

14:11.508 --> 14:14.589
Okay, okay, no, no.
We're moving back, moving back.

14:15.062 --> 14:16.045
Further back.

14:16.429 --> 14:18.186
Way
back.

14:18.925 --> 14:20.588
Before
the fear.

14:23.126 --> 14:24.467
Here we go.

14:25.586 --> 14:28.061
We are going
back.

14:36.866 --> 14:38.321
Is that a smile?

14:41.025 --> 14:42.329
Are you happy?

14:44.389 --> 14:45.409
Where are you?

14:47.388 --> 14:48.540
Where are you?

14:53.113 --> 14:54.568
Okay, listen up.

14:54.867 --> 14:57.175
You know the situation.
We've got a missing woman.

14:57.453 --> 15:00.971
Her name is Sally Larkin.
Her husband is suspect number one.

15:01.657 --> 15:02.696
Now, Mr. Lar.

15:02.942 --> 15:06.198
Kin owns this house right here,
and these seven acres.

15:06.387 --> 15:09.555
And we are gonna search
that seven acres thoroughly.

15:10.154 --> 15:10.952
Let's go.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.904
Mr. Monk, it's pretty high up.
You might wanna stay in the car.

15:24.024 --> 15:25.517
Do I have to?

15:25.660 --> 15:28.287
Do you have to? No.
You're the boss.

15:28.426 --> 15:29.805
It's such a nice day.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.032
Might be fun to run around.

15:32.495 --> 15:33.683
You wanna run around?

15:35.158 --> 15:36.840
There's the Captain.
Come on!

15:38.224 --> 15:40.651
Terrain's a little rough.
Try to stay in formation.

15:40.771 --> 15:42.409
Eyes forward and down.

15:42.529 --> 15:44.546
We're looking for anything unusual.

15:44.666 --> 15:48.838
Signs of a struggle,
freshly dug dirt, articles of clothing.

15:48.958 --> 15:51.324
- Any questions?
- Yeah, what do we win?

15:51.816 --> 15:53.839
- What do we win?
- If we find the body.

15:53.959 --> 15:55.263
You don't win anything.

15:58.613 --> 15:59.359
Right?

16:03.825 --> 16:06.017
You're going too fast.

16:14.667 --> 16:17.986
- Oh, my god. Are you okay?
- Never felt better.

16:18.106 --> 16:20.909
- Wait, should I get a wipe?
- No, don't move. Don't move.

16:24.936 --> 16:26.912
- What are you doing?
- Do you like butter?

16:27.867 --> 16:28.566
Yes.

16:29.642 --> 16:30.643
Let's see.

16:34.205 --> 16:36.491
Did you did you get
enough sleep last night?

16:36.617 --> 16:39.929
Did you!
Do you dare me to climb that tree?

16:40.061 --> 16:41.670
- What?
- What about that tree?

16:41.897 --> 16:44.610
I bet I could climb that
tree and swing over to that tree.

16:45.179 --> 16:46.332
You think I could?

16:46.639 --> 16:47.682
I don't know.

16:48.664 --> 16:51.106
Wow, that tree.
That tree!

17:11.326 --> 17:13.112
Over here!
Hey!

17:13.301 --> 17:14.936
Everybody, I got something!

17:15.057 --> 17:17.201
- What is it?
- Okay, but I saw it first.

17:17.320 --> 17:20.393
- You saw it first? Who the hell cares?
- I care. That's who.

17:21.519 --> 17:23.599
Okay, so you saw it first.
What is it?

17:24.555 --> 17:27.505
Okay, but here's the rule:
you guys can't touch it.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.525
I understand.
We're all cops here.

17:30.866 --> 17:31.999
I can touch it.

17:32.724 --> 17:34.217
Natalie can touch it.

17:35.095 --> 17:38.081
Just me and natalie,
and nobody else.

17:42.434 --> 17:43.814
See?
I'm gonna.

17:45.381 --> 17:46.930
I'm gonna call him hoppy.

17:47.162 --> 17:49.222
Because he likes to, you know,
hop.

17:51.325 --> 17:53.876
Isn't there
a shoe box in your car?

17:54.399 --> 17:56.821
That could be hoppy's house.
Let me go get it.

17:56.954 --> 17:58.201
Let me go get it.

18:01.609 --> 18:02.611
Let's go.

18:08.599 --> 18:10.435
- Hello.
- Back again.

18:10.569 --> 18:12.832
Yeah, like a bad penny.
Is he here?

18:12.958 --> 18:16.184
He's just finishing up a phone call.
So have a seat and he'll be right out.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.230
Thank you.

18:23.460 --> 18:25.842
I have a frog.
It's in the car.

18:27.327 --> 18:28.327
Really?

18:32.216 --> 18:33.539
Is it your birthday?

18:34.047 --> 18:35.570
- Yes, it is.
- Happy birthday.

18:35.690 --> 18:37.107
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

18:37.227 --> 18:39.389
- How old are you?
- Mr. Monk.

18:39.509 --> 18:42.432
- Are you over or under 100?
- What are you doing?

18:42.623 --> 18:46.441
- I'm 57. You look great.
- 57, wow, 57.

18:46.651 --> 18:48.324
So you're really getting up there.

18:48.456 --> 18:50.839
- Well, I wouldn't say that.
- I would.

18:51.065 --> 18:52.728
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

18:54.032 --> 18:56.961
- So have you heard anything?
- Not from your wife.

18:57.081 --> 18:59.816
We've spoken to a number
of local merchants, however.

18:59.953 --> 19:02.201
Apparently she was,
trying to sell some jewelry.

19:02.977 --> 19:04.494
Well, that's.
That's unusual.

19:04.955 --> 19:06.372
Normally, she's buying.

19:06.883 --> 19:08.184
Guess how old she is.

19:08.637 --> 19:11.365
- I think I'm gonna take my break.
- Yeah, sure.

19:12.166 --> 19:14.188
- Do you have to make?
- Make what?

19:16.512 --> 19:17.448
Is he drunk?

19:17.610 --> 19:19.359
I spoke to a number of sally's friends.

19:19.482 --> 19:21.693
They said that sally
was afraid for her life.

19:22.309 --> 19:24.306
Yeah. Well, she's crazy.
I'm hungry.

19:24.426 --> 19:26.052
- Yeah, you just had lunch.
- So?

19:28.526 --> 19:31.564
When I was here Earlier, I asked,
for a list of all your properties.

19:31.684 --> 19:33.167
Yeah, I got it right here.

19:33.645 --> 19:35.799
Emily, could you please
bring in the list?

19:38.941 --> 19:42.929
This is Emily Carter, my office manager.
Emily, these people are from the police.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.002
Hello.

19:44.698 --> 19:46.909
So these are your current projects?

19:47.144 --> 19:48.277
Yeah, I think so.

19:48.741 --> 19:52.231
Let's see, these are residential
properties. Undeveloped land.

19:52.351 --> 19:54.785
These are some condos
we're working on up north.

19:54.905 --> 19:57.747
We're going to have to search all of
these, with your permission, of course.

19:57.867 --> 20:00.048
Yeah, sure, be my guest.
Whatever you need.

20:00.421 --> 20:04.087
You might not believe this, but,
I want my wife found as much as you do.

20:04.216 --> 20:05.596
I've got nothing to hide.

20:07.809 --> 20:08.980
I think you do.

20:10.384 --> 20:12.198
I think you have plenty to hide.

20:12.596 --> 20:14.724
- He's in love with her.
- What?

20:15.061 --> 20:17.893
I bet they want to get married,
and go on a honeymoon, and,

20:18.122 --> 20:19.861
you know,
kiss.

20:21.014 --> 20:22.299
Who, who is this person?

20:22.419 --> 20:24.606
Look at his face.
He's turning all red.

20:25.156 --> 20:28.678
Just admit it. You want to marry her.
It's all over town.

20:28.862 --> 20:31.859
- What does that mean?
- It's all right, Emily. This is

20:32.214 --> 20:35.618
Adrian Monk. He's famous.
He's the best detective in California.

20:35.738 --> 20:38.421
And yeah, it's true.
Emily and I are involved.

20:38.554 --> 20:41.780
As a matter of fact, I was with emily
the night sally disappeared.

20:42.351 --> 20:44.930
Well, if that checks out,
it looks like you have an alibi then.

20:46.107 --> 20:47.861
Why didn't you tell us before?

20:48.711 --> 20:51.186
Well, Captain,
it's a little, complicated.

20:51.306 --> 20:53.783
I'm technically still married.

20:54.629 --> 20:56.456
We've been keeping
it secret for three years,

20:56.576 --> 20:58.863
But you saw right through it
in two minutes, Mr. Monk.

20:58.983 --> 21:01.201
Well done.
I am curious,

21:01.321 --> 21:03.249
though,
how did you.

21:04.147 --> 21:05.432
What gave us away?

21:06.064 --> 21:07.028
Cinchy.

21:07.219 --> 21:10.212
I saw you drinking out of her
water bottle without wiping it off.

21:10.810 --> 21:12.549
You weren't afraid of her cooties.

21:13.566 --> 21:14.511
My cooties.

21:17.555 --> 21:18.765
Candy machine.

21:19.970 --> 21:22.105
I'm gonna talk to him.
For a long time.

21:23.339 --> 21:25.911
Sold out, sold out.
Chocolate Pretzels!

21:26.364 --> 21:28.881
Do you have seven Dimes and a Nickel,
or three quarters or a hammer?

21:29.001 --> 21:31.624
Let's get some Candy Later. Right now,
we're gonna go talk to Dr. Bell.

21:31.744 --> 21:33.077
You mean Dr. Smell?

21:33.197 --> 21:36.242
Mr. Monk, what's going on?
Did you take some cold medicine?

21:36.563 --> 21:38.937
No, he just talked to me.
He didn't give me any medicine.

21:39.057 --> 21:41.711
- Who? Who talked to you?
- Nobody.

21:45.348 --> 21:46.274
Oh, my god.

21:47.336 --> 21:48.848
You went to that hypnotist.

21:50.623 --> 21:53.732
I need you to look at me. Look at me
right now. Look at me, listen to me.

21:53.865 --> 21:55.966
- How old are you?
- How old are you?

21:57.194 --> 21:58.743
I need you to tell me right now.

21:59.697 --> 22:00.925
How old are you?

22:03.542 --> 22:06.718
That's for me to know,
and you to find out. I call shotgun!

22:10.954 --> 22:11.766
Stop!

22:17.749 --> 22:19.638
You have to call the police.

22:21.262 --> 22:24.182
- You like pancakes?
- Love 'em!

22:25.762 --> 22:28.514
I'll bet you always wanted
pancakes like this for breakfast.

22:28.634 --> 22:31.508
Always wanted 'em!
But my mom never made 'em.

22:32.877 --> 22:35.506
Never. Davey palmer.
He lived across the street.

22:35.996 --> 22:38.377
They had pancakes every day.

22:38.879 --> 22:39.922
We never did.

22:40.451 --> 22:42.568
So this is like a dream come true.

22:43.137 --> 22:46.852
Hoppy likes 'em too!
Look at that! Look at hoppy!

22:48.357 --> 22:50.715
Listen, I'm gonna talk to your friend
for just a minute.

22:50.835 --> 22:52.210
I'll be right back.

22:55.488 --> 22:58.571
- What do you think?
- I think you should have called me.

22:59.632 --> 23:02.418
Hypnotism is no substitute
for real treatment.

23:03.050 --> 23:04.781
I'm aware of this Dr. Climan.

23:05.279 --> 23:07.190
I've been cleaning
up his messes for years.

23:07.339 --> 23:09.785
I told him not to call that guy.
I made him promise.

23:10.125 --> 23:12.432
Can't you just. You'know.
Snap him out of it, doc?

23:13.128 --> 23:15.087
It doesn't work like that, Lieutenant.

23:15.207 --> 23:18.281
Even if I could I wouldn't recommend it.
It might trigger some deeper

23:18.406 --> 23:19.597
depressive reaction.

23:20.930 --> 23:23.065
He's returned to an earlier ego state.

23:23.336 --> 23:25.735
Emotionally, he's about six and a half,
seven years old.

23:25.856 --> 23:27.723
Is he reliving his childhood?

23:27.843 --> 23:28.899
Not at all.

23:29.019 --> 23:31.198
No, he's living the childhood
he always wanted.

23:31.746 --> 23:34.023
You might call it a,
wish fulfillment.

23:34.147 --> 23:35.432
We're outta syrup!

23:36.400 --> 23:37.741
We're outta syrup!

23:39.223 --> 23:41.406
He couldn't live like this forever,
right?

23:41.526 --> 23:43.516
No, of course not.
No, not like that.

23:43.991 --> 23:46.406
But the good news is,
at some deeper level,

23:47.120 --> 23:48.556
Adrian knows that too.

23:49.019 --> 23:51.438
Eventually,
he'll snap himself out of it.

23:52.503 --> 23:54.630
Don't worry.
He'll come back to us.

23:55.539 --> 23:58.479
We have a.
A syrup emergency here!

23:59.621 --> 24:00.811
Grenade!

24:01.703 --> 24:03.442
Hey!
Good shot!

24:04.292 --> 24:05.161
Disher.

24:08.316 --> 24:09.129
When?

24:11.980 --> 24:13.130
Yeah, I understand.

24:15.066 --> 24:17.466
You're not gonna believe this.
This is weird.

24:17.766 --> 24:19.131
Weirder than this?

24:19.477 --> 24:21.820
They just found Sally
Larkin in sonoma county.

24:21.948 --> 24:22.987
She's alive.

24:23.865 --> 24:26.234
Okay.
We gotta go. Thanks, doc.

24:26.820 --> 24:28.225
I call shotgun!

24:30.969 --> 24:33.104
Listen,
young feller.

24:34.162 --> 24:37.092
Why don't you just stay here
with Natalie and draw us a picture?

24:37.663 --> 24:38.891
Look, actually.

24:39.058 --> 24:42.592
If he's not in the way,
I would consider bringing him along.

24:43.523 --> 24:47.043
Treat him as an adult.
Just stick to the normal routine.

24:47.641 --> 24:49.210
I think that's the best medicine.

24:53.140 --> 24:54.614
Okay, you can come.

24:55.107 --> 24:57.419
- Can I bring hoppy?
- Look, monk, it's a crime scene.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.504
You can't bring a frog to a crime scene.

25:02.870 --> 25:04.718
- Okay, hoppy can come.
- Great.

25:04.838 --> 25:07.120
We'll just stop at the
store and grab the syrup.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.264
Okay, we'll stop at
the store and get syrup.

25:09.459 --> 25:10.526
I really wish.

25:10.658 --> 25:12.717
I know, I know.
We should've called you.

25:16.633 --> 25:20.019
We don't have all the details, Ken.
Here is what we do know:

25:20.181 --> 25:23.398
Aaron Larkin, the multimillionaire
developer. Is dead.

25:23.792 --> 25:27.326
He was killed in this hunting
Cabin last night by his estranged wife.

25:27.739 --> 25:31.283
<i>According to police, Sally Larkin
was chained up in this Cabin like</i>

25:31.421 --> 25:34.352
<i>a prisoner of war for
three horrifying days.</i>

25:34.615 --> 25:36.236
<i>Last night, in a daring escape,</i>

25:36.356 --> 25:39.395
<i>she overpowered her husband,
beat him to death,</i>

25:39.536 --> 25:42.598
<i>then ran up that hill
and stopped a passing motorist.</i>

25:43.525 --> 25:44.677
<i>Back to you, ken.</i>

25:48.067 --> 25:50.948
She's still at the hospital.
We haven't got a statement yet.

25:51.436 --> 25:53.344
Pretty obvious what
happened here, though.

25:53.464 --> 25:55.811
- Kept her chained up in the corner.
- Oh, my god.

25:55.931 --> 25:57.617
- Like an animal.
- Yep.

25:57.737 --> 26:00.667
Probably drove up here every night,
brought her food and water.

26:00.815 --> 26:01.835
Hey, hey, hey!

26:03.137 --> 26:04.131
It's not a toy.

26:04.251 --> 26:06.487
Here Mr. Monk, look, look, look...
A tractor!

26:06.607 --> 26:07.816
Go sit over here.

26:10.477 --> 26:11.497
Hey!
Hey!

26:14.957 --> 26:16.583
So why didn't he just kill her?

26:17.866 --> 26:20.212
I'm sure he intended to eventually.

26:20.332 --> 26:21.522
All right, well...

26:21.929 --> 26:23.895
She told some paramedic that she.

26:24.514 --> 26:26.290
Loosened one of those baseboards.

26:26.783 --> 26:29.499
She pretended to be asleep.
When he came back to check on her.

26:29.631 --> 26:30.954
Bam. Side of the head.

26:35.652 --> 26:38.449
Monk, do you have something
you'd like to share with the rest of us?

26:39.475 --> 26:41.025
I can see his butt.

26:42.137 --> 26:45.671
- Mr. Monk, the man is dead.
- Yeah, of embarrassment!

26:46.538 --> 26:47.423
Sorry.

26:47.804 --> 26:48.919
I've got it.

26:49.735 --> 26:51.152
Here's what happened:

26:51.532 --> 26:54.993
Tuesday night, Larkin abducted
his wife from that parking lot.

26:55.113 --> 26:57.579
He overpowered her.
Maybe he drugged her.

26:57.722 --> 26:59.473
Then, he brought her up here.

27:00.260 --> 27:01.715
<i>He kept her prisoner.</i>

27:02.373 --> 27:04.371
<i>For three days, he taunted her.</i>

27:04.778 --> 27:06.592
<i>He humiliated her.</i>

27:06.842 --> 27:08.792
<i>Something about some jewelry.</i>

27:09.278 --> 27:12.150
<i>Then...
</i>

27:12.587 --> 27:14.335
<i>Last night he went a little too far.</i>

27:14.455 --> 27:17.534
<i>In all the excitement,
his pants fell down.</i>

27:27.888 --> 27:29.106
<i>He killed himself.</i>

27:29.758 --> 27:31.340
He didn't have a choice.

27:33.272 --> 27:34.972
She'd seen his hiney.

27:44.963 --> 27:46.842
- I think we're done here.
- Great.

27:48.854 --> 27:51.052
I always knew aaron was crazy,
but I.

27:51.335 --> 27:52.970
I never dreamed that he would...

28:00.578 --> 28:03.799
I mean, three days in that
horrible room.

28:04.557 --> 28:06.870
You know, you could do this tomorrow,
if you'd like.

28:09.706 --> 28:12.385
No, thank you, I would just rather
get it over with today.

28:12.505 --> 28:13.936
Okay,
all right.

28:15.353 --> 28:17.318
What. What did he say?
What did he want?

28:17.583 --> 28:21.583
He was just. Acting crazy,
asking me about my jewelry.

28:23.196 --> 28:24.525
I hid most of it.

28:24.719 --> 28:26.738
He just wanted to know where I kept it.

28:27.327 --> 28:30.187
And I know that as soon as I told
him where it was, he would've killed me.

28:30.319 --> 28:31.396
She's a liar.

28:43.393 --> 28:47.002
There is no way she spent
three days in that cabin.

28:47.439 --> 28:48.811
- No way.
- Why not?

28:49.380 --> 28:51.903
There's no Tv,
so it's impossible.

28:52.161 --> 28:53.408
She woulda died.

28:53.985 --> 28:56.948
I'm sorry, i'll explain later.
Could you go on, please?

28:57.141 --> 29:00.446
Well, last night, before
he came back, I had

29:00.995 --> 29:04.468
pried one of the Floorboards loose,
and then I pretended to be asleep.

29:05.822 --> 29:07.665
When he got closer, I hit him.

29:08.485 --> 29:09.732
I didn't mean to.

29:10.737 --> 29:11.777
To kill him.

29:13.327 --> 29:14.404
Maybe I did.

29:14.951 --> 29:17.805
Or maybe I did.
Or maybe I did.

29:18.667 --> 29:21.478
I didn't mean to kill him.
I'm innocent, I tell ya.

29:22.256 --> 29:25.403
She's a liar, liar,
pants on fire!

29:26.367 --> 29:29.850
A girl can't beat up a boy.
That's scientifically impossible a.

29:31.174 --> 29:34.067
Okay, look. I don't care what
Dr. Bell Said, Natalie.

29:34.187 --> 29:36.390
One more peep,
I want him out of here, understood?

29:36.531 --> 29:39.187
One more peep,
and I'll Clobber him myself.

29:39.495 --> 29:41.067
What's that smell?

29:41.823 --> 29:43.391
Keep your arms down.

29:46.245 --> 29:48.574
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

29:48.909 --> 29:50.279
How did you get away?

29:51.401 --> 29:54.542
Well, I had this shackle on my leg.
This big iron thing.

29:55.398 --> 29:56.608
After I hit him,

29:57.042 --> 30:00.361
I went and got the keychain
out of his pocket and unlocked it.

30:00.776 --> 30:03.871
Look. I still have the bruise.
I can barely walk.

30:04.454 --> 30:06.047
Is that gum on your shoe?

30:08.011 --> 30:09.958
How much would you give me to eat this?

30:11.281 --> 30:12.207
Five bucks.

30:14.507 --> 30:16.706
For god's sake!
Monk, that's disgusting!

30:16.826 --> 30:19.131
Spit it out.
Please, spit that out right now.

30:24.040 --> 30:25.004
Five bucks.

30:25.957 --> 30:26.977
Well, all right.

30:28.924 --> 30:30.039
He earned it.

30:35.715 --> 30:36.754
Wait a minute.

30:37.217 --> 30:39.711
She is a liar, Stottlemeyer.

30:40.859 --> 30:42.503
She's a big, fat liar.

30:43.318 --> 30:44.903
And I can prove it.

30:45.869 --> 30:47.966
- Do I have to listen to this?
- No ma'am, you do not.

30:48.086 --> 30:50.566
- Natalie, I said one more peep.
- But she made the whole thing up.

30:50.686 --> 30:52.900
- I can prove it!
- Just a minute. Tell me in the car.

30:53.020 --> 30:55.726
You are in a lot of trouble, facelift.
You are going to Jail.

30:55.846 --> 30:56.933
Get him out of here!

30:57.053 --> 30:59.389
- You are a bad lady.
- You know what? And you're a bad boy.

30:59.509 --> 31:01.536
All right? We're gonna go home.
You need a time out.

31:01.656 --> 31:03.425
Don't you wanna hear
how I figured it out?

31:03.545 --> 31:05.993
- No, I do not!
- All right, fine!

31:06.202 --> 31:07.489
I'm not gonna tell ya!

31:08.374 --> 31:09.276
Good.

31:09.396 --> 31:11.185
I'm not gonna tell any of you, because.

31:12.344 --> 31:13.558
Because I hate you.

31:14.643 --> 31:17.441
And by the way,
you're all stupid.

31:17.878 --> 31:20.835
And you don't deserve to know the truth.
And also by the way,

31:21.461 --> 31:22.944
you're never gonna see me again.

31:23.939 --> 31:24.708
Ever.

31:26.107 --> 31:28.005
'cause I'm going to France.

31:30.904 --> 31:31.905
Come on, Hoppy.

31:33.841 --> 31:34.933
You're not stupid.

31:43.132 --> 31:43.983
Sorry.

31:45.230 --> 31:46.382
Mr. Monk.

31:47.156 --> 31:49.121
Wait, Mr. Monk!
Wait, wait!

32:56.799 --> 32:58.674
Indecent exposure?

32:58.794 --> 33:00.211
There's no such thing.

33:00.654 --> 33:03.054
The human body is a beautiful thing!

33:03.291 --> 33:04.745
It is beautiful!

33:05.060 --> 33:07.023
The whole world is beautiful!

33:07.151 --> 33:08.911
You are beautiful.
And so are you.

33:09.031 --> 33:11.786
Come on, let's all get naked.
Let's all get naked!

33:12.152 --> 33:14.152
Free yourself!
We were born free,

33:14.272 --> 33:16.341
just free yourself and let.

33:19.076 --> 33:20.266
I'm free.

34:06.165 --> 34:09.003
This park is for children.
Why don't you go home?

34:09.195 --> 34:10.915
Come on, honey.
Let's get out of here.

34:41.101 --> 34:42.726
She's right, Hoppy.

34:45.474 --> 34:46.702
Let's go home.

34:48.905 --> 34:51.974
There will be an inquest next week,
but it's just a formality.

34:52.320 --> 34:55.187
Is there anything else we can
do for you? Anyone we can call?

34:55.306 --> 34:56.887
No, no thank you, Lieutenant.

34:57.007 --> 34:59.115
I think what I need
is just some time alone.

34:59.277 --> 35:01.554
A nice cup of tea
and a good night's sleep.

35:02.140 --> 35:05.490
Sounds like a good idea. We'll do
what we can do to keep the press away.

35:05.613 --> 35:07.472
I appreciate that.
Thank you, Captain.

35:58.172 --> 36:00.927
Okay, this is it, my friend.
Home sweet home.

36:02.103 --> 36:04.031
At least one of us will be free.

36:04.433 --> 36:05.321
Go ahead.

36:05.840 --> 36:06.704
Go on.

36:07.361 --> 36:08.400
You can do it.

36:09.894 --> 36:10.782
Atta boy.

36:14.032 --> 36:14.863
Hello.

36:16.271 --> 36:17.518
It's Adrian, right?

36:19.144 --> 36:20.429
How did you get here?

36:21.006 --> 36:22.121
I took the bus.

36:23.071 --> 36:24.299
Good for you.

36:24.446 --> 36:25.579
All by yourself?

36:26.637 --> 36:27.770
Me and the frog.

36:28.582 --> 36:29.319
Right.

36:30.271 --> 36:31.991
It's hoppy.
Right?

36:33.995 --> 36:36.584
Well, are you hungry?
I've got some cookies in the house.

36:37.898 --> 36:39.050
I know what you did.

36:40.190 --> 36:41.659
And I know how you did it.

36:42.685 --> 36:45.217
What, do you think
I still did something bad?

36:45.822 --> 36:46.559
Why?

36:48.236 --> 36:49.559
Is it because i'm a girl?

36:50.468 --> 36:51.989
Because you're a girl.

36:52.326 --> 36:55.085
Who signed a pre-nup
and then regretted it.

36:55.939 --> 36:58.415
You wanted it all, didn't you?
All his money.

37:00.234 --> 37:02.458
- You're different.
- Here's what happened:

37:02.978 --> 37:04.820
<i>your husband never abducted you.</i>

37:05.264 --> 37:06.588
<i>No one abducted you.</i>

37:06.708 --> 37:08.913
<i>It was a setup from the very beginning.</i>

37:10.741 --> 37:14.085
<i>You did spend three days in that cabin,
but you weren't a prisoner.</i>

37:14.438 --> 37:15.988
<i>You were hiding out.</i>

37:16.394 --> 37:19.222
You were waiting.
You chained yourself up

37:19.342 --> 37:20.983
so the bruises would be real.

37:21.113 --> 37:22.749
<i>And you starved yourself.</i>

37:23.082 --> 37:26.699
<i>You were an actress, preparing for
the biggest performance of your life.</i>

37:29.707 --> 37:32.809
<i>Then, last night,
you went back to your house.</i>

37:33.218 --> 37:36.743
<i>You brought a rug from the cabin
and you put it down to the floor.</i>

37:37.936 --> 37:38.818
<i>Then,</i>

37:39.173 --> 37:40.722
<i>you waited in the shadows.</i>

37:47.745 --> 37:51.070
<i>You killed him there,
then dragged his body back to the cabin.</i>

37:51.890 --> 37:53.091
<i>It was show time.</i>

37:53.571 --> 37:57.520
<i>To the world, you were a woman who
had escaped from her sadistic husband.</i>

37:59.030 --> 38:00.111
<i>You were a hero.</i>

38:00.276 --> 38:01.906
<i>A very wealthy hero.</i>

38:08.814 --> 38:12.240
Well, that's a very
nice little story,

38:12.533 --> 38:13.709
detective Monk.

38:14.096 --> 38:15.502
It's more than a story.

38:16.770 --> 38:18.597
I can prove
that you didn't spend three days

38:18.718 --> 38:20.653
in that cabin, chained
to the floorboards.

38:22.099 --> 38:23.257
You made one mistake.

38:23.709 --> 38:26.822
<i>While you were missing, we went
to your house to question your husband.</i>

38:27.205 --> 38:28.931
<i>The captain was chewing some gum.</i>

38:29.258 --> 38:31.622
<i>He had some trouble.
He ended up spitting it out.</i>

38:32.531 --> 38:34.400
<i>Last night,
after the murder,</i>

38:34.848 --> 38:37.634
<i>you accidentally stepped
on the same piece of gum.</i>

38:42.522 --> 38:43.736
This piece of gum.

38:45.162 --> 38:46.976
The one that was stuck to your shoe.

38:48.632 --> 38:51.022
You can't prove that's the same piece
of gum. Gum is gum.

38:51.149 --> 38:52.133
Not this gum.

38:52.721 --> 38:54.268
This is Disher-Mint gum.

38:54.869 --> 38:56.857
Diet blueberry.
It's homemade.

38:58.390 --> 38:59.668
It was on your shoe.

39:00.655 --> 39:03.032
You've been chewing that
piece of gum for five hours?

39:03.341 --> 39:03.980
No.

39:04.451 --> 39:06.930
I've been chewing this piece
of gum for five and a...

39:07.987 --> 39:08.715
Half.

39:10.680 --> 39:11.856
Oh, my god.

39:12.723 --> 39:15.803
Chewing this gum
for five and a half hours!

39:34.594 --> 39:35.706
Gimme that gum.

39:36.027 --> 39:38.123
- Gimme that gum!
- Mrs. Larkin, drop it!

39:38.816 --> 39:40.442
Drop it!
Mrs. Larkin,

39:40.910 --> 39:41.881
put it down!

39:46.860 --> 39:47.524
God!

39:48.722 --> 39:50.757
Somebody wanna tell me what's going on?

39:50.932 --> 39:53.257
Just take the gum. Just take the gum.
It's material evidence.

39:53.377 --> 39:55.818
Take the gum. I'll explain
everything later. Just take the gum.

39:56.605 --> 39:57.698
Is this my gum?

39:57.914 --> 39:59.291
God.
Oh my god!

39:59.411 --> 40:01.556
Fight over this.
I've got a basement full of this stuff.

40:01.676 --> 40:04.174
It was in your mouth.
And it was on her shoe.

40:04.366 --> 40:06.617
And I was chewing it.
Are you.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.528
I was chewing it!
Are you okay?

40:08.653 --> 40:11.056
I gotta go home and
gargle for a very long time.

40:11.857 --> 40:14.425
Oh, my god. Is that mud?
Is that. Is that mud?!

40:15.492 --> 40:17.702
- Is that mud?
- Yes, Monk, it's mud!

40:18.686 --> 40:19.742
Welcome back!

40:26.329 --> 40:29.179
- I could make you some pancakes.
- No, I'm fine.

40:29.364 --> 40:30.936
We have that syrup you like.

40:31.100 --> 40:32.621
No, I'm good.
Thank you.

40:35.465 --> 40:36.922
They grow up so fast.

40:37.288 --> 40:38.821
- What?
- Nothing.

40:42.144 --> 40:43.976
Mr. Monk, you have to see this.

40:44.143 --> 40:45.063
What is it?

40:45.395 --> 40:48.718
There's a nest outside your
window with three baby birds!

40:49.239 --> 40:51.860
- I'll call the exterminator.
- You wouldn't dare.

40:52.740 --> 40:54.222
She's feeding them.

40:54.614 --> 40:57.395
Mr. Monk, come here,
you have to see this. They're so cute!

40:57.515 --> 40:59.364
It's the circle of life.
Aren't you curious?

40:59.484 --> 41:01.377
Yeah, I believe you.
Circle of life.

41:01.556 --> 41:02.936
I'll get my camera!

41:30.591 --> 41:31.690
I don't get it.

41:32.305 --> 41:38.660
