WEBVTT

00:09.719 --> 00:11.801
Thank you for your help.

00:21.189 --> 00:23.976
This bag smells like feet.

00:24.066 --> 00:25.931
We need to hurry. The guard
could be back at any second.

00:26.027 --> 00:28.313
Listen, I know you said that
you wanted me to see Nadia,

00:28.404 --> 00:31.191
and I know that I said I would
be mature about this entire thing.

00:31.282 --> 00:34.365
But I just, I don't really feel like
it's all that necessary anymore. So--

00:34.452 --> 00:36.818
Look, if somebody that
I slept with and care about

00:36.913 --> 00:38.778
told me that they had
a girlfriend in a coma,

00:38.873 --> 00:40.738
trapped inside a top secret facility

00:40.833 --> 00:44.667
run by a society of
uber-humanoids called the Fae,

00:44.754 --> 00:47.120
I'd think it was a blow off.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.001
I really need you to meet her.

00:49.091 --> 00:50.547
Okay.

00:59.310 --> 01:02.518
Wow! She's so pretty.

01:02.605 --> 01:04.095
Even like this.

01:04.190 --> 01:08.684
Can't imagine what she must look like
when she's up and walking around.

01:08.778 --> 01:11.485
She has the most beautiful smile.

01:11.572 --> 01:13.028
You know, ever since we got a lead,

01:13.115 --> 01:16.243
all I can think about
is finding a cure for her.

01:21.207 --> 01:26.372
Well, I guess the only thing left to do

01:26.462 --> 01:28.953
is figure out what this nail means.

01:32.885 --> 01:34.500
The Morrigan never said anything else?

01:34.595 --> 01:36.335
How the nail could save her?

01:36.430 --> 01:39.092
No. And I kind of get the feeling
that even if she did know something,

01:39.183 --> 01:43.176
she'd take too much pleasure
in torturing me to ever tell me.

01:44.939 --> 01:49.353
Thank you for letting me see Nadia.

01:49.443 --> 01:52.276
We'll figure this out, I promise.

01:52.363 --> 01:56.151
[GROUNDSKEEPER]
P Farewell and adieu P

01:56.242 --> 02:00.451
P Fair Spanish ladies... P

02:11.757 --> 02:13.622
Hey!

02:13.718 --> 02:15.709
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

02:21.851 --> 02:24.763
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

02:24.854 --> 02:27.766
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

02:27.857 --> 02:30.769
My love carries a death sentence.

02:30.860 --> 02:32.942
l was lost for years,

02:33.029 --> 02:35.691
searching, while hiding,

02:35.781 --> 02:39.945
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

02:40.036 --> 02:44.905
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.085
Wait. Your husband was kidnapped?

02:52.173 --> 02:54.084
Christoph died less than a week ago.

02:54.175 --> 02:56.587
Donovan went to the
cemetery this morning and

02:56.677 --> 02:59.134
the grave was dug up
and his body was gone.

02:59.221 --> 03:02.805
They desecrated his grave, his memory.

03:02.892 --> 03:04.974
What kind of a sick animal
could do such a thing?

03:05.061 --> 03:08.849
Did you or Christoph have any
issues with anyone, any enemies?

03:08.939 --> 03:10.930
Everyone loved Christoph.

03:11.025 --> 03:15.485
Donnie's my oldest friend,
so I need you two to help me.

03:15.571 --> 03:17.027
Please find out what happened.

03:17.114 --> 03:19.366
Of course. Anything. You know that.

03:19.450 --> 03:23.068
Yeah, I just have to get out of a
security detail. It's not a biggie.

03:24.372 --> 03:26.078
This is him.

03:29.210 --> 03:33.579
Do you have any idea what he was
wearing when he was uh... taken?

03:33.672 --> 03:37.961
Leotards, tights, slippers.

03:38.052 --> 03:38.916
Excuse me?

03:39.011 --> 03:42.378
Christoph was one of the
finest dancers in the world.

03:42.473 --> 03:45.260
He was buried the way he lived.

03:45.351 --> 03:47.683
I never got a chance to say sorry.

03:49.397 --> 03:52.981
He just wanted me to be present,
not work, but I yelled.

03:53.067 --> 03:57.026
I made him drive to
the theatre by himself.

03:57.113 --> 04:00.776
It took them three hours to
get his body out of the wreck.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.450
My partner was knocked out cold.

04:05.538 --> 04:07.995
The sky started to fill
up with dark clouds,

04:08.082 --> 04:09.242
there was a storm brewing.

04:09.333 --> 04:14.919
A storm of thunder,
lightning, and Hale.

04:15.005 --> 04:19.044
But then, the Behemoth
let out a mighty howl.

04:19.135 --> 04:22.298
He was ready to rock, so I looked
that fool dead in the eye.

04:22.388 --> 04:23.594
He only had one eye.

04:23.681 --> 04:25.967
And I sang him asleep
until he was sucking his thumb

04:26.058 --> 04:28.595
like a little kitten about to wet the bed.

04:28.686 --> 04:30.893
Yeah. I mean, what can I say, ladies?

04:30.980 --> 04:34.564
I got a job to do, so I do it.

04:35.317 --> 04:36.477
Hale?

04:36.569 --> 04:40.061
Hey. What's up, man?

04:40.156 --> 04:42.112
l was just telling my friends here

04:42.199 --> 04:44.235
how we took down that
Behemoth that time.

04:44.326 --> 04:45.862
Oh, yeah, that was back in the day.

04:45.953 --> 04:50.071
We were lucky to have this
sexy, singing superstar along.

04:50.166 --> 04:53.499
Hey, did I tell you about the
new security detail | just pulled?

04:53.586 --> 04:55.247
What? What detail?

04:55.337 --> 04:56.622
The Glaive.

04:56.714 --> 04:59.000
The Glaive! My man, Dyson.

04:59.091 --> 05:01.468
Protecting the Attorney
General for all Fae-kind.

05:01.552 --> 05:03.463
The only problem is I can't do it.

05:03.554 --> 05:05.090
Trick needs me to do something else.

05:05.181 --> 05:10.016
So, I need to find someone smart,
tough, competent, sexy wouldn't hurt.

05:10.102 --> 05:12.935
Hey, ladies, you know anybody
by that description? Huh?

05:13.022 --> 05:15.729
Whoa. Do you know
anyone with that description?

05:15.816 --> 05:19.604
I don't know, man.
It's a big commitment, twelve hours.

05:19.695 --> 05:21.856
I'm your man.

05:21.947 --> 05:23.278
Who else you going
to trust with the Glaive?

05:23.365 --> 05:25.276
I don't know.

05:25.367 --> 05:28.951
People say Sirens are sexy ladies
sitting sidesaddle on the rocks

05:29.038 --> 05:30.198
singing folks to their death.

05:30.289 --> 05:33.201
But uh, he knows I'm
as tough as they come.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.532
Yeah. Right?

05:34.627 --> 05:35.833
You know, I don't know.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.911
I mean, looks like you
got your hands full here.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.245
I don't want to take
that away from you.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.296
--I think I should find some--
--Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:41.383 --> 05:43.044
Come on, man. Why you playin'?

05:43.135 --> 05:44.636
--You want this?
--Yes!

05:44.720 --> 05:46.301
--All right, you got it.
--All right!

05:46.388 --> 05:49.630
Okay. Oh, and here she is.

05:50.809 --> 05:54.347
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I thought the Glaive was older.

05:54.438 --> 05:56.394
What is she, the Fae Doogie
Howser or something?

05:56.482 --> 05:58.438
Well, the detail's not
for the Glaive per se,

05:58.526 --> 06:01.689
it's for her daughter and...

06:01.779 --> 06:03.064
...she comes with instructions.

06:03.155 --> 06:04.486
I bet.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.564
--Dyson.
--Tori.

06:06.659 --> 06:07.819
Good luck.

06:07.910 --> 06:12.028
No booze, no boys,
no rap music, no coffee.

06:12.122 --> 06:13.373
Got it.

06:13.457 --> 06:15.288
Are you as boring as Dyson?

06:15.376 --> 06:16.832
Excuse me?

06:19.672 --> 06:24.587
[BO] Imagine coming to lay flowers
and the man you love is gone.

06:24.677 --> 06:26.508
| smell something.

06:36.939 --> 06:38.395
Here.

06:41.777 --> 06:44.644
I'm no gravedigger, but aren't
they supposed to go in the ground?

06:44.738 --> 06:46.774
It's a hunting kill.

06:47.741 --> 06:51.108
Shot to the head, throat's been slit to
drain the blood before the heart stops

06:51.203 --> 06:53.068
so the meat doesn't spoil.

06:53.163 --> 06:54.243
Never take me hunting.

06:54.331 --> 06:58.074
Strange though. They've only taken
the sweetbreads, the delicacies.

06:58.168 --> 07:01.626
So, we're looking for a
flesh-eating Fae foodie?

07:01.714 --> 07:05.172
Or his butcher. Cheenoo.

07:05.259 --> 07:07.045
Who's Cheenoo?

07:07.136 --> 07:09.172
Not a who, a what.

07:09.263 --> 07:11.970
It's a type of Fae that
only eats human flesh.

07:12.057 --> 07:15.470
And you wonder why I never
aligned myself with a clan.

07:15.561 --> 07:17.802
Can't wait to meet this guy.

07:19.648 --> 07:23.106
And the Behemoth lets out a
mighty howl and he starts running.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.319
He's ready to get down.

07:24.403 --> 07:25.188
Oh my god.

07:25.279 --> 07:28.191
l was timing that entire dumb story
to see how long it would take you

07:28.282 --> 07:31.319
to realize that I actually didn't
care what you were talking about.

07:31.410 --> 07:33.366
But now, even that's boring.

07:33.454 --> 07:34.534
Hey.

07:34.622 --> 07:35.657
Is there anything in the Fae world

07:35.748 --> 07:38.410
that can get that new
doggie smell out of tights?

07:38.500 --> 07:39.706
Brings you down, little mama?

07:39.793 --> 07:42.580
Oh, I was helping my cuz with
his pit bulls at the doggie dentist.

07:42.671 --> 07:47.131
Oh, dude, there is not enough suction
in that little tube for dog slobber.

07:47.217 --> 07:50.380
And now I'm thinking,
"Why not hook up with my bestie,

07:50.471 --> 07:55.636
succubus our way into the spa so
mama can get herself a little rinse."

07:55.726 --> 07:56.715
Who's this?

07:56.810 --> 07:58.926
Big security detail I'm doing.

07:59.021 --> 08:00.727
Very high profile client.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.429
He's babysitting for my mom.

08:02.524 --> 08:05.607
And he won't let me do
anything fun at all. It sucks.

08:05.694 --> 08:09.232
Hale, does the trust fund
Faeby speak the truth?

08:09.323 --> 08:12.736
l have very specific orders that
l have to follow to the letter.

08:12.826 --> 08:14.942
I'm not allowed to do anything.

08:15.037 --> 08:15.992
You see this?

08:16.080 --> 08:17.911
|'m telepathic, so I don't
need a cell phone.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.410
But my stupid mom makes me
wear a stupid tracking bracelet

08:20.501 --> 08:23.334
so she can track my
whereabouts all the time.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.331
That is a raw deal.

08:25.422 --> 08:27.629
Yeah, and when my stuff was
getting messed up like that,

08:27.716 --> 08:29.923
I hit the road and I ain't
never looked back.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.716
Oh, easy, Kenz.

08:31.804 --> 08:34.511
What kind of Fae are you,
Light or Dark?

08:34.598 --> 08:36.634
I'm not Fae. l'm human.

08:36.725 --> 08:39.137
And you just come and go
as you please?

08:39.228 --> 08:41.640
I guess, technically,
my B.F.F., Bo, claimed me.

08:41.730 --> 08:44.221
But yeah, I call my own shots, sista.

08:44.316 --> 08:45.852
That is so cool.

08:45.943 --> 08:48.730
I've never met a claimed human
that's just allowed to run free.

08:48.821 --> 08:49.810
I'm so jealous.

08:49.905 --> 08:50.690
Hey, hey, look, look,

08:50.739 --> 08:53.230
I'm not saying that some of
these rules aren't ridiculous

08:53.325 --> 08:55.190
and I'm not saying they're fair, Tori.

08:55.285 --> 08:56.491
But this is important.

08:56.578 --> 09:00.992
How important is it to ruin a young
woman's chance at freedom?

09:01.083 --> 09:02.869
The Glaive's instructions were clear.

09:02.960 --> 09:06.452
Tori is not to drink
or have fun of any kind.

09:06.547 --> 09:07.536
I got a list.

09:07.631 --> 09:11.249
Hale, bubby, come on, I got this.

09:11.343 --> 09:15.461
I got this and l have your best
interests at heart, trust me.

09:15.556 --> 09:18.548
I understand the
lady-in-captivity dealio.

09:18.642 --> 09:20.473
We're just going to have some fun.

09:20.561 --> 09:22.893
Tori's going to have a lovely time

09:22.980 --> 09:26.347
and Detective Hale is going
to come out looking like a hero.

09:26.442 --> 09:27.682
Please, Mr. Hale, sir.

09:27.776 --> 09:30.893
Please, please, please,
please, please, please.

09:30.988 --> 09:32.478
Okay.

09:33.741 --> 09:35.231
A little fun.

09:35.325 --> 09:39.614
But Kenzi, you have to be smart
about this. And responsible.

09:39.705 --> 09:42.742
Dude, those two words are,
like, both my middle names.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.950
And I'm not even drinking
this month, I'm on a cleanse.

09:46.044 --> 09:49.582
I am so your fairy godmother.

10:04.354 --> 10:05.730
My goodness.

10:05.814 --> 10:08.726
You almost scared the life out of me.

10:12.488 --> 10:14.353
Christoph, relax.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.780
You're in such exalted company.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.779
The finest lady marksman
in the Old West.

10:19.870 --> 10:22.532
A five star general.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.239
Genius of the Italian kitchen.

10:25.334 --> 10:26.540
I want to see my husband.

10:26.627 --> 10:30.119
Don't be scared, dear boy.

10:30.214 --> 10:32.296
I am a huge fan of yours.

10:32.382 --> 10:35.966
And soon, I am sure,
you'll be a big fan of mine.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.260
Isn't that right, everyone?

10:45.145 --> 10:47.477
[chanting]

10:49.024 --> 10:51.106
The fates have smiled upon me

10:51.193 --> 10:54.560
and now, you will dance again.

11:09.378 --> 11:10.584
[DYSON] How are you doing, Gary?

11:10.671 --> 11:12.161
You been down to the cemetery lately?

11:12.256 --> 11:15.089
You got a lot of nerve
coming here, Wolfboy.

11:15.175 --> 11:17.131
You so much as lay a finger on me

11:17.219 --> 11:19.961
and I'll eat it right off
your Light Fae hand.

11:20.055 --> 11:22.717
Hey, man, I'm just here
to borrow some sugar.

11:22.808 --> 11:24.423
This is Bo's deal.

11:24.518 --> 11:26.804
Do you know Bo? She's unaligned,

11:26.895 --> 11:29.853
which means she's got the right
to do whatever she wants to you.

11:29.940 --> 11:34.400
Oh, and she's got a
pretty wicked temper.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.477
We used to date.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.446
What happened to your
finger there, Gary?

11:40.534 --> 11:42.695
You're not so good
with the meat cleaver?

11:42.786 --> 11:44.777
Oh, you know what they say,

11:44.872 --> 11:48.660
sometimes a flesh-eater's
just too tired to get out of bed,

11:48.750 --> 11:51.207
go to the fridge, know what I mean?

12:02.264 --> 12:05.756
Gary, what do you know
about a groundskeeper?

12:05.851 --> 12:10.891
I run a respectable and legal
organic human meat butcher shop.

12:10.981 --> 12:13.142
Are you having an office party?

12:13.233 --> 12:15.645
Is your Dark Fae son coming of age?

12:15.736 --> 12:19.729
Looking for something special and
easy to eat for your buffet table?

12:19.823 --> 12:22.735
Well, look no further
than Gary's Meats.

12:22.826 --> 12:27.286
We've got chops, liver,
ribs, eyeballs, loins--

12:27.372 --> 12:28.987
The groundskeeper
was murdered, Gary.

12:29.082 --> 12:30.288
He had a family.

12:30.375 --> 12:32.912
Humans are chosen by farmers.

12:33.003 --> 12:37.121
Now these farmers watch and
monitor these humans their whole life,

12:37.215 --> 12:40.207
living habits, eating habits, et cetera.

12:40.302 --> 12:44.841
See, a vegan who works out three
times a week--ooh, top shelf, baby.

12:44.932 --> 12:49.972
But a smoker who sits at a desk
all day, "get yer red hots here."

12:50.062 --> 12:54.977
I butcher what's brought to me and
keep a portion of every body for myself.

12:55.067 --> 12:59.060
Are you sure you don't know
anything about this groundskeeper?

12:59.154 --> 13:01.987
Anything at all?

13:02.074 --> 13:05.191
I would be very grateful.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.448
Maybe we could feed some
of those other appetites.

13:08.538 --> 13:12.247
Oh, baby. I want to eat you up.

13:12.334 --> 13:16.327
I want to bite your little cheeks off and
fry 'em up in a little butter and cream!

13:16.421 --> 13:17.672
Come here.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.297
You listen to me, Gary.

13:20.384 --> 13:22.966
If you don't talk,
my friend Dyson here,

13:23.053 --> 13:25.465
he's going to pin this
murder on you anyway.

13:25.555 --> 13:28.843
And as a condition of
your life in a human prison,

13:28.934 --> 13:31.550
he's going to make sure you
get four square meals a day...

13:31.645 --> 13:34.102
...all vegetarian.

13:35.273 --> 13:38.231
Oh, that groundskeeper.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.560
I butchered him.

13:41.655 --> 13:43.065
I butchered him for a Lich.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.774
Wow, Gary, you really should
charge more for what you do.

13:49.413 --> 13:52.029
L-i-c-h. Lich.

13:52.124 --> 13:54.490
Are you sure?

13:54.584 --> 13:56.120
You know this Lich?

13:56.211 --> 13:58.702
It's an ancient Egyptian
Fae royal family.

13:58.797 --> 14:00.037
They found a way to cheat death,

14:00.132 --> 14:04.045
keep themselves alive to feed their
insatiable hunger for knowledge.

14:04.136 --> 14:07.094
The Lich eats flesh to feed his body.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.796
But he lives to feed his mind.

14:09.891 --> 14:11.882
He's bad news, Bo.

14:17.816 --> 14:19.306
--Address!
--You don't expect me

14:19.401 --> 14:21.312
to give you anything on the Lich.

14:21.403 --> 14:24.065
Be like signing a death warrant.

14:24.156 --> 14:26.112
Tofu, Gary.

14:27.784 --> 14:30.571
Tofu four times a day.

14:32.456 --> 14:36.369
You guys didn't get this
address from me, okay?

14:44.342 --> 14:46.924
And I'm also sort of e-mail
dating this guy named Zak.

14:47.012 --> 14:49.173
He's really cute and
has really big arms.

14:49.264 --> 14:51.050
But that's okay because he's tentative.

14:51.141 --> 14:52.051
Uh huh.

14:52.142 --> 14:53.882
Okay, little ladies,

14:53.977 --> 14:56.138
I think it's time to
turn the music down.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.560
--Oh...
--Yeah, the people would like

14:57.647 --> 15:00.605
the usual easy listening
time at the Dal, you know.

15:00.692 --> 15:04.310
Yeah. Well, I guess everybody else
should have a really important mom.

15:04.404 --> 15:09.364
I'm the Glaive's daughter, bitches.

15:09.451 --> 15:10.816
You can't talk to the people like that.

15:10.911 --> 15:14.278
Have you called my
mother yet to check in?

15:14.372 --> 15:15.282
Was I supposed to?

15:15.373 --> 15:18.240
Duh! You're my babysitter.

15:18.335 --> 15:21.998
If you don't check in every three
hours, my mom craps her panties.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.545
Uh oh.

15:23.632 --> 15:25.873
You know, I'm going to
make the call, all right?

15:25.967 --> 15:28.299
Wait, wait, wait, wait, Kenzi, Kenzi,
that's her last drink.

15:28.386 --> 15:29.842
You got it, boss.

15:32.349 --> 15:34.465
[LICH] Embrace the pain, Christoph.

15:34.559 --> 15:37.767
Every time you leap, I can
feel your quads burning.

15:37.854 --> 15:42.143
That is not fatigue, it is your
artistry begging to be broken,

15:42.234 --> 15:45.351
to be compromised,
but you mustn't let it!

15:46.613 --> 15:48.854
Take five and towel off!

15:50.909 --> 15:52.991
I'm sorry, this is a closed rehearsal.

15:53.078 --> 15:55.694
We're here on behalf of the
owner of the local waystation.

15:55.789 --> 15:57.495
I am sure it was just an oversight,

15:57.582 --> 16:01.871
but you and your party failed
to sign in when you came to town.

16:01.962 --> 16:05.705
Ah. What an absolute ninny I've been.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.632
I'm so sorry for the...
what was it you called it?

16:08.718 --> 16:09.924
Oversight.

16:10.011 --> 16:13.879
Yes. How well put. Oversight.

16:13.974 --> 16:17.717
Please give my regrets to
Mr. Fitzpatrick MacCorieghan,

16:17.811 --> 16:21.599
but I'm leaving in the morning so
I hardly think it will be necessary now.

16:21.690 --> 16:26.309
My goodness, you are gorgeous.

16:26.403 --> 16:30.612
Though, you, my dear, are divine.

16:35.370 --> 16:38.783
Yes, ma'am, yes.

16:41.126 --> 16:43.583
while you were working.

16:43.670 --> 16:49.415
Yeah, I can assure you, your daughter--
she is having the time of her...

16:49.509 --> 16:52.376
Ma'am, she is so bored
out of her trees, ma'am.

16:52.470 --> 16:56.179
Yes, as per your instructions...

16:56.266 --> 16:57.881
Yes.

17:08.278 --> 17:09.484
Man.

17:09.571 --> 17:11.436
This is one of those moments
where I wish working homicide

17:11.531 --> 17:14.614
meant you got to do the killing.

17:14.701 --> 17:17.784
I didn't realize times
were so hard in this city

17:17.871 --> 17:22.991
that a Light Fae police detective
and an undeclared succubus

17:23.084 --> 17:28.420
had to stoop to delivering
messages for a retired king.

17:28.506 --> 17:31.873
I've always wanted
to meet a succubus.

17:31.968 --> 17:35.335
I once travelled through the southern
interior of Africa with the Dutch

17:35.430 --> 17:37.136
during the Boer War.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.715
I tried to give General
Viljoen some pointers,

17:42.312 --> 17:47.807
I witnessed men do unspeakable
things for a few pretty white stones,

17:47.901 --> 17:52.270
but what I searched for
was so much more.

17:52.364 --> 17:57.233
Such hunger, such lust.

17:57.327 --> 18:00.990
Power to kill with a kiss.

18:01.081 --> 18:04.665
I know almost everything
there is to know,

18:04.751 --> 18:07.413
yet I don't know what you feel.

18:07.504 --> 18:13.591
Such uncontrollable passion,
such burning desire.

18:14.636 --> 18:17.002
You've taken the husband
of a very good friend of ours

18:17.097 --> 18:20.009
and we'd like him back, now!

18:20.100 --> 18:22.307
My deary me! Who?

18:22.394 --> 18:26.262
Christoph, the dancer.

18:26.356 --> 18:29.143
Hmm? What's that, Christoph?

18:29.234 --> 18:35.981
Your marriage was technically over
when you were pronounced dead.

18:36.074 --> 18:37.564
The dancer does have a point.

18:37.659 --> 18:40.867
Christoph, come with us now.

18:40.954 --> 18:45.493
Pity, he seems rather
content, I should say.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.950
Of course, I am such an
interesting person to be around.

18:49.045 --> 18:52.082
Which is why I would like
to invite you, plus one,

18:52.173 --> 18:56.587
to my New Acquisitions exhibit
and wine and cheese this afternoon.

18:56.678 --> 18:58.259
Well, I can't wait.

18:58.346 --> 19:02.089
Sorry, Light Fae being on the
premises, bit of a Fae faux pas.

19:02.183 --> 19:05.220
Don't worry, I got a date.

19:05.312 --> 19:06.722
Come on, Dyson,

19:06.813 --> 19:12.308
let's go before my uncontrollable
passion makes me forget my manners.

19:12.402 --> 19:13.858
I'll see you later.

19:22.287 --> 19:27.702
Wait, wait, wait, he's eating Christoph?

19:27.792 --> 19:30.454
No. He's eating humans, not Fae.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.786
He ate the groundskeeper,
but Christoph is fine.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.587
He's not fine!

19:34.674 --> 19:35.914
He's up and he's alive,

19:36.009 --> 19:39.001
which I'm having a little trouble
reconciling at the moment.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.801
And he's being held hostage by that--

19:40.889 --> 19:42.129
Easy, Donny!

19:42.223 --> 19:44.179
Don't, Trick!

19:46.853 --> 19:48.309
Don't.

19:50.690 --> 19:54.774
I want you two to stop
talking and get Chris back.

20:00.575 --> 20:02.406
What else can you
tell me about this Lich?

20:02.494 --> 20:05.076
Well, he's leaving town tomorrow,
which doesn't give us a lot of time

20:05.163 --> 20:08.075
to get Christoph back or stop
him from eating more humans.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.498
In order to achieve immortality,

20:10.585 --> 20:13.952
some believe that the Lich
puts his chi into a phylactery.

20:14.047 --> 20:15.537
A container for the soul.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.499
You destroy the container,
you destroy the Lich.

20:18.593 --> 20:21.130
Of course, the truth is
nobody really knows

20:21.221 --> 20:25.760
how the Lich was able to cheat death.
But it's not a bad theory.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.260
Was there anything around his neck?

20:27.352 --> 20:28.808
No.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.305
--Oh, wait a second.
--What?

20:30.397 --> 20:32.888
There was this creepy
painting of the Lich,

20:32.982 --> 20:35.940
back when he was younger
and less fall-y apart-y.

20:36.027 --> 20:39.440
He was wearing this amulet
around his neck like a beetle.

20:39.531 --> 20:42.147
I don't know, something about the way it
stood out in the painting, it seemed--

20:42.242 --> 20:43.903
--|mportant?
--[BO] Yeah.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.733
Picture of Dorian Gray maybe?

20:45.829 --> 20:49.617
The Lich's life essence is
contained in the painting itself.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.538
Destroy the picture and
we'll know soon enough.

20:51.626 --> 20:54.288
Well, that's exactly what I plan
to do at his little show-and-tell.

20:54.379 --> 20:57.746
Those under the Lich's power,
their souls can't pass over.

20:57.841 --> 21:00.503
They live a tortured existence.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.800
We have to bring Christoph back.

21:02.887 --> 21:05.139
And if there's any way,
bring him back alive,

21:05.223 --> 21:07.054
for however long that might be.

21:07.142 --> 21:11.476
I know Donovan would love the
opportunity to say a proper good-bye.

21:11.563 --> 21:13.599
I will bring him back alive.

21:13.690 --> 21:16.227
And make sure you
bring yourself back alive.

21:16.317 --> 21:18.444
These Lichs are notoriously ruthless.

21:18.528 --> 21:21.315
Don't worry, I got back up.

21:21.823 --> 21:24.155
Look, look, I am only going
to say this one more time--

21:24.242 --> 21:27.325
I need a very hush-hush
A.P.B. put out on two young girls.

21:27.412 --> 21:29.744
One, a twenty-one-year-old blond

21:29.831 --> 21:32.789
wearing a pink sleeveless
top and a bad attitude.

21:32.876 --> 21:36.585
Two, a blue-eyed pain in the...

21:36.671 --> 21:38.002
She goes by Kenzi.

21:38.089 --> 21:40.045
Don't use the names, okay?

21:40.133 --> 21:42.419
I can't have certain people finding out.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.886
Hey, my partner.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.339
Yeah, epitome of handsome.
What's going on?

21:49.434 --> 21:50.970
There's a Lich in town.

21:51.060 --> 21:53.847
Stole one of Trick's friends from the
grave and it's stressing everyone out.

21:53.938 --> 21:54.927
Is Trick okay?

21:55.023 --> 21:57.264
Yeah, you know,
he's stronger than he looks.

21:57.358 --> 21:58.564
How's things with Tori going?

21:58.651 --> 22:00.767
Yeah, she's okay. Awesome.

22:00.862 --> 22:04.946
A special little girl. Makes me
want to have kids of my own.

22:05.033 --> 22:06.614
So, so precious.

22:06.701 --> 22:09.408
--You lost her, didn't you?
--Man, she just vanished.

22:09.496 --> 22:10.611
Did she pull the old

22:10.705 --> 22:11.865
"You're supposed to
phone my mother" gag?

22:11.956 --> 22:12.741
How'd you know?

22:12.832 --> 22:15.039
She did the same thing to me
the first time I looked after her.

22:15.126 --> 22:17.117
Which is why

22:17.212 --> 22:18.918
I got a receiver for
her tracking bracelet

22:19.005 --> 22:20.836
the last time the Glaive was in town.

22:20.924 --> 22:23.711
My man. My man.

22:23.801 --> 22:24.631
Yes!

22:24.719 --> 22:27.756
So, thanks for getting Dyson to
sneak me out of the compound.

22:27.847 --> 22:32.432
We both know I could
use the fresh air, but um...

22:32.519 --> 22:35.556
...you want to tell me
what's really going on?

22:35.647 --> 22:38.935
Well, in addition to
wanting you as my backup,

22:39.025 --> 22:41.562
I thought you should
talk to this Lich fellow.

22:41.653 --> 22:46.864
He's been everywhere, met everyone
and learned everything.

22:46.950 --> 22:49.692
And I thought he could tell us
what the deal is with this little guy.

22:49.786 --> 22:52.243
And we can get Nadia back to you.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.157
There. All pretty.

22:57.252 --> 23:02.337
You know, things have really been
bleak for me this past few years.

23:02.423 --> 23:07.292
And I don't know what I would
do without... your friendship.

23:09.597 --> 23:13.636
Are you sure you're okay
with this, helping me with Nadia?

23:18.481 --> 23:19.982
Blot.

23:35.540 --> 23:41.376
Ah, mademoiselle, I'm so
thrilled you could make it.

23:41.462 --> 23:42.918
Enchanté.

23:44.716 --> 23:48.550
I have prepared the most
wonderful show for you.

23:48.636 --> 23:50.877
What is this show for, exactly?

23:50.972 --> 23:54.715
I have these little salons
for myself all the time.

23:54.809 --> 23:57.721
It's not enough to merely
feed oneself physically.

23:57.812 --> 23:59.848
One must always nurture the intellect.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.476
Feed the mind and soul, as it were.

24:02.567 --> 24:05.604
You see, in raising my dolls
back from the dead,

24:05.695 --> 24:09.187
I get to experience
their very specific talents.

24:09.282 --> 24:11.694
I've been world-class athletes,

24:11.784 --> 24:14.947
blood-thirsty generals,
brilliant physicists.

24:15.038 --> 24:21.580
A long life is only worthwhile if
one can fill it with the extraordinary.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.581
Let my festivities begin!

24:42.315 --> 24:44.681
I was so right about this boy.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.453
[door shutting]

24:59.540 --> 25:01.622
What are you girls doing?

25:05.880 --> 25:07.336
Oh, okay.

25:09.717 --> 25:11.628
--Hey!
--Can someone explain to me

25:11.719 --> 25:13.755
why you left the Dal
without telling me?

25:13.846 --> 25:15.837
We totally forgot.

25:15.932 --> 25:18.674
We're actually getting
warmed up to go clubbing.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.725
I totally heard that.

25:21.813 --> 25:22.848
I didn't say anything.

25:22.939 --> 25:25.681
I'm telepathic, you idiot.

25:25.775 --> 25:29.814
Oh, gosh, I think that tequila
I drank wants to get out and party.

25:29.904 --> 25:31.735
--You gave her tequila?
--I tried to hide the booze,

25:31.823 --> 25:34.735
but you heard her, she's a telepath.

25:37.161 --> 25:39.618
Get it off. Get it off me.

25:39.706 --> 25:41.913
Okay, Linda Blair. Okay.

25:41.999 --> 25:44.456
Let's get you horizontal. Sit down.

25:44.544 --> 25:45.784
--It ain't right.
--Right here. Okay.

25:45.878 --> 25:47.493
--Ain't no dignity in getting puked on.
--Okay.

25:47.588 --> 25:49.044
It'sjust...

25:50.633 --> 25:52.419
Get it off me.

25:52.510 --> 25:54.216
Why do I have to touch it?

25:54.303 --> 25:56.168
Okay. Okay.

26:01.728 --> 26:04.140
Okay. All right.

26:10.862 --> 26:12.944
Can I help you?

26:13.030 --> 26:14.531
Oh, I was just...

26:14.615 --> 26:17.573
...sizing you up to see if I had
anything that might fit you.

26:17.660 --> 26:19.446
--Uh huh.
--O bviously.

26:19.537 --> 26:21.619
Just get Tori sobered up
'cause if you don't,

26:21.706 --> 26:24.493
the Glaive is going to make
garters out of my tender bits.

26:24.584 --> 26:26.745
And I need my tender bits.

26:35.052 --> 26:37.919
Makes me cry every time
I hear this piece.

26:42.018 --> 26:45.977
The artistry lies in the fact that even
though the composer was German,

26:46.063 --> 26:49.100
I gave him the gift of inspiration

26:49.192 --> 26:53.936
from my own various travels through...

26:54.030 --> 26:55.895
...everywhere.

26:58.701 --> 27:02.410
You know, I spent a few months
in the Congo with a medical group.

27:02.497 --> 27:04.613
Congo, dreadful place.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.823
Well, it wasn't exactly a vacation.

27:06.918 --> 27:10.206
I was there treating
patients of an epidemic.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.378
It was killing a Fae tribe.

27:12.465 --> 27:16.208
You're the human doctor
who found the cure.

27:16.302 --> 27:19.214
Your Ash was very wise
to snatch you up.

27:19.305 --> 27:21.136
Lucky dog.

27:21.224 --> 27:24.216
While I was there, my girlfriend,
Nadia, fell into a coma.

27:24.310 --> 27:27.347
I haven't been able to get
anywhere with a diagnosis.

27:27.438 --> 27:30.976
The epidemic cure didn't work on her.

27:31.067 --> 27:32.853
But the Morrigan gave me this.

27:32.944 --> 27:36.903
Said it was a clue to Nadia's illness.

27:36.989 --> 27:40.527
Coma, indeed.

27:40.618 --> 27:42.108
Do you know something?

27:42.203 --> 27:45.115
I'm watching the show.

28:10.398 --> 28:11.763
Out of the way, Trick!

28:11.858 --> 28:13.064
Can't do that, Donny.

28:13.150 --> 28:14.060
I don't want to hurt you,

28:14.151 --> 28:17.063
but I will if that's what it
takes to get Christoph back.

28:21.158 --> 28:22.864
Give me the dagger!

28:24.829 --> 28:26.285
Donny.

28:30.918 --> 28:34.376
He was dead, Trick.
I witnessed him dying.

28:34.463 --> 28:38.422
And now to know that
that demon has him.

28:38.509 --> 28:40.374
How can you expect
me to just sit here?

28:40.469 --> 28:44.678
You of all people understand, I know
what it's like to lose a loved one.

28:44.765 --> 28:48.599
When my wife was taken
from me, I felt powerless, too.

28:48.686 --> 28:51.644
But running into a situation
like this blindly and hot-headed

28:51.731 --> 28:54.518
will only make things worse.

28:54.609 --> 28:58.898
You know of what I speak.
You know howl ended up here.

28:58.988 --> 29:02.105
Be patient, friend. Bo is special.

29:02.199 --> 29:05.032
If anyone can get
Christoph back, it's her.

29:15.838 --> 29:18.500
You know, I feel like
we've really bonded.

29:18.591 --> 29:23.176
I have learned so much amazing stuff
about you and, of course, from you.

29:23.262 --> 29:25.503
Isn't there some kind of
agreement we could come to?

29:25.598 --> 29:28.761
Find it in your big,
several-thousand-year-old heart

29:28.851 --> 29:31.388
to hand Christoph over to me?

29:31.479 --> 29:32.810
Okay.

29:32.897 --> 29:34.853
--Really?
--No.

29:36.817 --> 29:39.729
Well, then I guess we'll
just have to do this my way.

29:43.491 --> 29:45.152
This is your last chance, pal.

29:45.242 --> 29:47.619
I tried to be nice,
but you just won't listen.

29:47.703 --> 29:48.738
So, I'm going to free everyone

29:48.829 --> 29:52.572
and destroy you in one fell swoop.
Unless you release Christoph now.

29:52.667 --> 29:54.703
Surely, you are bluffing.

29:54.794 --> 29:59.879
Do you have any idea how many
of the world's secrets I keep in here?

29:59.966 --> 30:02.082
Even you aren't that stupid.

30:02.176 --> 30:03.916
I gave you a chance.

30:31.747 --> 30:34.284
The Lich knows what
his entourage is thinking.

30:34.375 --> 30:36.286
He feels what they feel.

30:36.377 --> 30:38.743
Trick said that the Lich
puts his chi in a vessel.

30:38.838 --> 30:44.458
Or maybe it's not a vessel,
it's vessels. The entourage.

30:44.552 --> 30:47.544
I'll just suck the chi from
all of them individually.

30:47.638 --> 30:49.094
Easy peasy.

30:54.145 --> 30:55.476
Great.

30:55.563 --> 30:59.055
Leave it to me to bring
a knife to a gun fight.

30:59.150 --> 31:00.686
Take it easy.

31:08.117 --> 31:11.405
Ladies and gentlemen
of my entourage,

31:11.495 --> 31:14.532
the show I have been waiting for

31:14.623 --> 31:22.041
my entire long existence is upon us.

31:22.131 --> 31:26.249
I have fed my need
for intellectual pursuit.

31:26.343 --> 31:32.054
I have felt the transcendence
of musical performance.

31:32.141 --> 31:38.353
But I still long for something deeper.

31:40.191 --> 31:44.855
Finally, that moment has arrived.

31:44.945 --> 31:49.063
I will witness a succubus feed!

31:49.158 --> 31:53.948
Feed! Feed! Feed! Feed!

31:54.038 --> 31:58.156
This is far too good a
performance for a matinee.

31:59.668 --> 32:01.954
I know I said we should
spend more time together,

32:02.046 --> 32:04.662
but this is not what I had in mind.

32:04.757 --> 32:06.998
I am sorry for acting like a turd-head.

32:07.093 --> 32:09.835
You know, throwing up and stuff.

32:09.929 --> 32:13.342
That's okay, sweetie pie.
It's all over now.

32:19.021 --> 32:20.977
Oh, no, is this coffee?

32:21.065 --> 32:23.021
Coffee!

32:23.109 --> 32:24.940
What is the big deal?

32:38.749 --> 32:40.535
Oh, crap.

32:41.669 --> 32:43.876
You will feed off this human.

32:43.963 --> 32:45.499
No. I won't.

32:45.589 --> 32:48.251
Bo, just feed off me a little bit.

32:48.342 --> 32:49.798
Give him what he wants.

32:49.885 --> 32:51.500
No. That will not be good enough.

32:51.595 --> 32:56.931
The one thing that has always
eluded me is true, unbridled passion!

32:57.017 --> 32:59.884
I want to see it in action!

32:59.979 --> 33:02.345
You will suck all the life
out of this human.

33:02.439 --> 33:05.055
I have left enough
innocent bodies in my wake.

33:05.151 --> 33:09.064
I would rather die
than live like that again.

33:09.155 --> 33:10.611
Fine.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.609
I killed the Glaive's daughter.

33:16.704 --> 33:20.947
I killed... the Glaive's daughter.

33:21.041 --> 33:24.829
Dyson trusted me. He depended on me.

33:24.920 --> 33:26.171
This poor girl.

33:26.255 --> 33:29.839
Who doesn't drink coffee?
I mean, it's just coffee.

33:29.925 --> 33:32.917
You have it with breakfast
or when you're sitting in a café

33:33.012 --> 33:34.468
pretending to write a novel.

33:34.555 --> 33:37.763
It's not a drink, it's a hug.

33:37.850 --> 33:39.090
She was in my care.

33:39.185 --> 33:40.800
I'm going to be Fae food.

33:40.895 --> 33:43.307
Oh my god, they're going to
lock me up with a crazy beast

33:43.397 --> 33:49.484
and watch as he eats me for
breakfast, maybe with a coffee.

33:51.238 --> 33:52.227
What'd you hit me for?

33:52.323 --> 33:55.065
Why didn't you tell me
she couldn't drink coffee?

33:55.159 --> 33:56.069
What?!

33:56.160 --> 33:59.323
You were the one that was all like,
"Oh, please, let Tori have a fun night.

33:59.413 --> 34:00.619
She needs to be free."

34:00.706 --> 34:01.866
Because she did.

34:01.957 --> 34:05.700
She wasn't living in a castle being
guarded by an evil dragon, Kenzi.

34:05.794 --> 34:09.912
Her mom is just a jerk.
I had a job to do!

34:10.007 --> 34:12.544
I know. I know.

34:14.762 --> 34:17.048
No, no, no, no, no, Kenz.
Kenzi. Don't do that, girl.

34:17.139 --> 34:20.347
I just--| thought she
could use a night of fun.

34:20.434 --> 34:24.097
You know, I didn't know she was this
psycho chick that could break so easily.

34:24.188 --> 34:26.850
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
We'll figure this out, all right?

34:26.941 --> 34:28.727
It's okay, little mama.

34:28.817 --> 34:30.978
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be so mean.

34:31.070 --> 34:33.982
I'm sorry I ruined your whole life.

34:34.073 --> 34:38.157
Hey, don't exaggerate. It's going
to be all right. It'll be fine.

34:38.244 --> 34:39.575
--Really?
--Yeah.

34:39.662 --> 34:41.994
What are you going to do?

34:42.081 --> 34:43.537
Move.

34:45.000 --> 34:48.242
If you don't feed, I will kill you

34:48.337 --> 34:51.204
and then bring you back
and feel for myself

34:51.298 --> 34:55.507
when we both go on a blind,
lust-filled, murderous rampage.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.927
Bo. I can't stop the bleeding.
Just feed off of me, please.

34:59.014 --> 35:00.970
--You can't use me.
--I beg your pardon.

35:01.058 --> 35:03.140
That's why you didn't
just kill me right away

35:03.227 --> 35:06.219
and experience me like everyone else.

35:06.313 --> 35:08.053
--You can't.
--What is this nonsense?

35:08.148 --> 35:10.855
My chi is my life force.

35:10.943 --> 35:13.434
If you kill me, then it's gone forever.

35:13.529 --> 35:17.989
If you raised me, then you
can't experience my power.

35:18.075 --> 35:20.691
You can only watch me do it.

35:23.580 --> 35:25.491
Put the doctor on the table.

35:25.582 --> 35:27.447
--[BO] No.
--The succubus' petulance

35:27.543 --> 35:29.704
has made me hungry.

35:37.136 --> 35:41.425
No. No. No. Oh.

35:45.144 --> 35:47.055
This is your last chance.

35:47.146 --> 35:52.516
Surely, your lover's death would be
better by your hand than by my blade.

35:54.778 --> 35:58.316
Have it your own way, you stupid girl.

36:04.246 --> 36:07.158
No. No. No.

36:57.091 --> 37:00.925
I could be more powerful
than all other Fae.

37:01.011 --> 37:04.503
Everyone would kneel at my feet.

37:04.598 --> 37:08.056
There would be no more
Dark and no more Light.

37:08.143 --> 37:11.431
There would be only me.

37:24.243 --> 37:26.325
Oh, what happened? What happened?

37:26.412 --> 37:27.697
I don't know what happened.

37:27.788 --> 37:29.278
But you managed to...

37:29.373 --> 37:32.365
You sucked the chi out
of all of them, all at once.

37:32.459 --> 37:36.702
What? No. No!

37:36.797 --> 37:38.253
Oh, Christoph.

37:49.601 --> 37:53.719
No. Let me go, please.

37:53.814 --> 37:57.102
You can't know the torture it's been.

37:57.192 --> 37:59.353
Now I can rest.

38:04.032 --> 38:05.408
[KENZI] How about Buenos Aires?

38:05.492 --> 38:09.701
No. I got a cousin in BA. used to
drive me nuts when I was a kid.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.824
Only Siren I knew that was tone deaf.

38:11.915 --> 38:13.496
Make your ears bleed.

38:13.584 --> 38:16.701
I almost rather meet the wrath
of the Glaive than see his face again.

38:16.795 --> 38:20.037
Egypt! I like pyramids.
Do you like pyramids?

38:20.132 --> 38:23.295
Egypt. Hold on a second.

38:23.385 --> 38:25.717
I think Dyson said
there was a Lich in town.

38:25.804 --> 38:26.919
What's a Lich?

38:27.014 --> 38:29.255
Our only hope, princess.

38:35.439 --> 38:38.897
The nail the Morrigan
gave us-- what does it mean?

38:38.984 --> 38:41.771
Lauren's girlfriend isn't sick.

38:41.862 --> 38:43.568
She's been cursed.

38:43.655 --> 38:47.989
That nail is an African
shaman's cursing nail.

38:48.076 --> 38:52.319
Somewhere, there is a piece
of wood with Nadia's nail in it.

38:52.414 --> 38:57.329
Remove it and she
will most likely wake up.

38:57.419 --> 38:59.876
Please let me eat.

38:59.963 --> 39:03.797
Sorry, pal, life is off the menu.

39:03.884 --> 39:05.920
No more humans for you.

39:13.560 --> 39:18.395
I've experienced things
you people wouldn't believe.

39:19.983 --> 39:26.195
I felt the carnage as the Inquisition
marched through Spain.

39:26.281 --> 39:35.121
I felt the heat from the flames
as Rome was burnt to the ground.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.960
I felt...

39:40.587 --> 39:42.748
I felt--

39:47.761 --> 39:49.217
Come on.

40:07.573 --> 40:12.442
[TRICK] So, what are you going
to do before Christoph fades?

40:12.536 --> 40:14.993
We're going to our cottage on the lake.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.571
Just me and him and our
favourite place on Earth.

40:17.666 --> 40:19.406
I wish you had more time with him.

40:19.501 --> 40:23.164
Three days isn't a lot.
And, again, that's only a guess.

40:23.255 --> 40:26.167
He could die as early
as tonight, Donny.

40:27.593 --> 40:31.302
When Christoph was dying,
I begged for five more minutes.

40:31.388 --> 40:35.131
This time, any time's a blessing.

40:35.225 --> 40:39.013
Thank you for a proper
chance to say good-bye.

40:39.104 --> 40:40.935
You're welcome, my friend.

40:42.399 --> 40:44.390
Okay, where's the Lich?

40:44.484 --> 40:45.860
He's dead.

40:45.944 --> 40:48.356
--Dead?
--What?

40:48.447 --> 40:50.358
What do you... Oh, man!

40:50.449 --> 40:53.816
I needed that Lich to raise this girl
I was babysitting from the dead.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.036
They're going to send
me to the catacombs.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.452
You know what they do
to Sirens in prison?

40:57.539 --> 41:00.531
Hale! What did you do?

41:00.626 --> 41:04.164
Um, okay, look...

41:04.254 --> 41:06.586
"Buddy?
--Okay, hold on.

41:10.260 --> 41:12.672
'Cause I'm allergic to coffee.
It makes me pass out.

41:12.763 --> 41:16.005
Oh my god, but you had
no frickin' pulse.

41:16.099 --> 41:18.090
Duh! 'Cause when I go
into allergic shock,

41:18.185 --> 41:20.597
someone has to help
my second heart kick in.

41:20.687 --> 41:22.769
--Second heart?
--Duh!

41:22.856 --> 41:24.812
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

41:24.900 --> 41:26.561
Second heart?

41:26.652 --> 41:29.018
--Uh hmm.
--You got a second heart.

41:29.112 --> 41:31.273
She had a second heart!

41:32.991 --> 41:37.860
Look, Tori, I know we've
kind of had our differences,

41:37.954 --> 41:41.162
but if there's any way that you could
not tell your mom about the vomit,

41:41.249 --> 41:44.491
the booze and the coffee
and the rap music,

41:44.586 --> 41:47.248
I'd be eternally grateful.

41:47.339 --> 41:53.801
If my mum found out about any of this,
I'd be grounded for half a century.

41:53.887 --> 41:55.423
I really like you, Kenzi.

41:55.514 --> 41:57.721
You're a very spirited human.

41:57.808 --> 41:58.923
Thank you.

41:59.017 --> 42:02.054
How much, Detective?

42:02.145 --> 42:04.887
--Excuse me?
--How much for the human?

42:07.943 --> 42:09.899
I'll take fifty bucks and
a promise that I never see

42:09.986 --> 42:11.522
--Fifty bucks?
--her scrawny, meddling ass again.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.114
It's a deal.

42:17.119 --> 42:22.910
Actually, this spirited human has
a special place in my heart, too.

42:22.999 --> 42:25.957
So, I will have to respectfully decline.

42:26.044 --> 42:29.002
Okay. Fine.

42:29.089 --> 42:31.751
Anyways, thanks for a great night.

42:33.176 --> 42:36.213
I actually had fun.

42:40.851 --> 42:42.716
Thank you, Hale.

42:42.811 --> 42:45.974
Thank you for not selling me
to a psycho Fae socialite.

42:46.064 --> 42:47.804
Silence, human.

42:49.985 --> 42:51.566
Ow.

42:55.323 --> 42:58.406
You really need to figure out
a better way to get me in here.

42:58.493 --> 43:00.233
You know, I've spent
years looking for a cure

43:00.328 --> 43:03.820
to a disease she doesn't even have.

43:03.915 --> 43:07.032
Who would curse Nadia?
I mean, why would anybody...

43:07.127 --> 43:08.708
Maybe think of this as a blessing.

43:08.795 --> 43:11.332
I mean, we're one step closer
to getting Nadia back to you.

43:11.423 --> 43:13.709
That's good, right?
