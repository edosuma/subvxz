1:23:58.700 --> 1:24:00.836
at night when you sleep.

1:24:00.903 --> 1:24:03.238
‐ It's gotta be hideou‐‐
oh, my God!

1:24:03.305 --> 1:24:04.606
What?
Look at me.

1:24:04.673 --> 1:24:06.174
‐ Look at the detail
in your eyebrows though.

1:24:06.241 --> 1:24:07.242
‐ Oh, no.

1:24:07.309 --> 1:24:08.844
‐ People pay
for those eyebrows.

1:24:08.911 --> 1:24:10.112
‐ The eyebrows are on fleek,

1:24:10.178 --> 1:24:11.580
but I feel so bad
for my pillow.

1:24:11.647 --> 1:24:13.248
I need a better sleep face.
