"Good Witch"...

00:02.597 --> 00:04.768
Have you told Grace you're
going to school in New York?

00:04.856 --> 00:06.767
- Something to talk about.
- That you're going?

00:06.855 --> 00:08.351
- Yes.
- We'll make it work.

00:08.446 --> 00:10.820
Well, if it isn't
Middletown's media king.

00:10.908 --> 00:12.353
He's looking for a host

00:12.448 --> 00:15.336
- for his new TV show.
- And he wants you?

00:15.424 --> 00:17.971
- Well, after I audition.
- I suppose I owe you

00:18.059 --> 00:20.151
- a thank you.
- I suppose you owe me a dinner.

00:20.245 --> 00:21.917
Slow down, Romeo.

00:22.090 --> 00:23.563
Let's stick to a thank you.

00:23.651 --> 00:24.828
I now pronounce you

00:24.916 --> 00:27.706
husband and wife.
You may kiss the bride.

00:38.190 --> 00:40.337
Wow! You know,
it was worth getting married

00:40.425 --> 00:42.762
- just for this cake.
- Well, it's good to know

00:42.850 --> 00:45.004
- I rank below baked goods.
- I didn't say below,

00:45.091 --> 00:46.846
but it's close.

00:47.821 --> 00:50.330
Mmm! Chocolaty, nice!

00:50.599 --> 00:53.698
Oh, this view is incredible.

00:54.089 --> 00:56.479
Hmm...
I prefer this view.

00:57.329 --> 00:59.407
Thanks for
an amazing honeymoon.

00:59.495 --> 01:01.135
Well, I couldn't have
done it without you.

01:01.331 --> 01:03.579
Two glasses of Merlot
for my favourite newlyweds.

01:03.667 --> 01:05.510
- Thank you, Erin.
- That's what we're here for.

01:05.598 --> 01:08.448
Are you two enjoying yourself?
Not really.

01:08.536 --> 01:10.551
All this peace and quiet
so distracting.

01:10.639 --> 01:12.946
Think how I feel.
I had to live with it my whole life.

01:13.034 --> 01:14.985
I can't believe how fast
this week went by.

01:15.073 --> 01:16.495
Mm-hmm, we hear that a lot.

01:16.583 --> 01:19.331
I find it best
just to enjoy the moment.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.750
She sounds like you.

01:20.838 --> 01:22.275
She makes perfect sense.

01:25.737 --> 01:27.096
Everything OK?

01:27.948 --> 01:29.313
Uh, sorry.

01:29.401 --> 01:31.172
I take it you weren't
expecting company?

01:31.260 --> 01:33.565
I was not expecting
my brother.

01:35.659 --> 01:36.845
Excuse me.

01:46.119 --> 01:47.993
And that's
my boyfriend Noah.

01:48.081 --> 01:50.241
He went back to New York
with his dad a few months ago.

01:50.386 --> 01:52.910
Must be hard doing
the long-distance thing.

01:52.997 --> 01:54.839
Well, not for us.

01:54.927 --> 01:57.401
No, we text, we videochat,

01:57.489 --> 01:59.159
- make it work.
- Can't wait to meet him.

01:59.254 --> 02:02.096
Then you only have to wait
two more days. I'm gonna go

02:02.184 --> 02:04.793
to the store. I'm gonna make him
his favourite muffins.

02:05.371 --> 02:06.714
This weekend cannot come

02:06.817 --> 02:08.792
- fast enough.
- Don't forget this.

02:08.880 --> 02:10.667
Oh! Thanks.

02:16.440 --> 02:19.284
Oh! Haha!

02:21.817 --> 02:23.979
Oh, great.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.034
- Pardon me?
- I'm sorry.

02:27.122 --> 02:29.646
- You're Martha Tinsdale.
- I am.

02:29.734 --> 02:31.932
I was finally calming
my nerves, but now that I know

02:32.020 --> 02:34.487
you're part of the competition
this is a big waste of time.

02:34.575 --> 02:37.709
Oh, well, no opportunity
is a waste of time.

02:37.797 --> 02:41.510
How do you always manage
to be so... on?

02:41.613 --> 02:43.651
It's just who I am!

02:44.307 --> 02:48.182
But in this situation,
I'll take a deep breath

02:48.531 --> 02:50.490
and visualize the audition,

02:50.662 --> 02:52.018
walk in with confidence,

02:52.106 --> 02:54.543
and then when that
red-light camera goes on, boom,

02:54.736 --> 02:58.956
- I'll knock their socks off.
- You ready, Martha?

02:59.044 --> 03:01.573
For my close-up? Always!

03:01.818 --> 03:03.495
Break a leg.

03:07.899 --> 03:09.540
Oh, well...

03:11.036 --> 03:14.518
- You can start whenever.
- Copy that!

03:18.656 --> 03:21.572
Oh! Uh...

03:22.042 --> 03:24.393
I... um...

03:24.480 --> 03:27.222
Martha, are you OK?

03:27.309 --> 03:29.260
I-I-I...

03:29.348 --> 03:31.394
ummm...

03:31.690 --> 03:33.534
I don't think

03:33.622 --> 03:35.755
anything could have
made this more perfect.

03:35.843 --> 03:39.112
- I saw cake over there.
- Oh, I stand corrected.

03:41.769 --> 03:43.807
Ah, you're
Erin's brother, right?

03:43.994 --> 03:46.736
- Connor Cleig.
- Well, she's a wonderful host.

03:46.824 --> 03:49.566
My wife and I love it here.
Yeah, it's, uh...

03:49.683 --> 03:51.996
- very different than New York.
- Oh, is that where you're from?

03:52.083 --> 03:53.824
It's where I live.
I'm from here.

03:53.985 --> 03:55.495
I actually own
half the place.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.307
Oh. Well then,
you'll be happy to know

03:57.395 --> 03:59.901
that we're planning to come back
next year for our anniversary.

03:59.989 --> 04:02.209
Ha! I'd enjoy it now.

04:02.504 --> 04:04.846
The vineyard probably
won't be here next year.

04:09.295 --> 04:11.370
But I... but I... I-I thought
that we were making

04:11.458 --> 04:13.677
this long-distance thing work.

04:18.401 --> 04:20.151
No, no, I...

04:20.512 --> 04:22.819
I get it. I get it.

04:23.110 --> 04:26.156
I-I guess I... can't
change your mind.

04:29.503 --> 04:31.089
Bye now.

Hello to you too.

05:21.868 --> 05:24.448
Oh! Sorry.

05:25.022 --> 05:26.241
Hi.

05:27.034 --> 05:28.878
What happened with Noah?

05:31.024 --> 05:32.513
That obvious?

05:32.601 --> 05:35.625
- I just know that look.
- Yeah...

05:36.437 --> 05:38.774
Noah was supposed
to come and visit

05:39.366 --> 05:41.421
this weekend, but, uh...

05:41.947 --> 05:46.975
- he broke up with me, so...
- Oh, Grace...

05:49.584 --> 05:51.492
I'm really sorry.

05:52.133 --> 05:55.664
Yeah. Just, um...

05:55.956 --> 05:58.148
I wish I didn't
have to feel

05:58.383 --> 05:59.862
this way.

06:00.199 --> 06:01.507
Everybody wishes they could

06:01.595 --> 06:03.984
fast-forward past the pain
of a breakup...

06:04.970 --> 06:07.828
but it's not like
we can set our clocks ahead.

06:09.662 --> 06:11.999
I'm here if you want
to talk.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.226
Thanks.

06:32.453 --> 06:34.629
Isn't the mayor's annual
charity fundraiser supposed

06:34.716 --> 06:36.544
- to be the party of the year?
- It is.

06:36.631 --> 06:39.329
Middleton's Fire Department
is a deserving cause, right?

06:39.416 --> 06:41.288
- Very.
- Don't people love your food?

06:41.375 --> 06:44.070
- They do. Thank you.
- Then why is my guest list

06:44.158 --> 06:46.185
shrinking with every text
I get? That's the fifth

06:46.273 --> 06:48.281
- cancellation today.
- You may get more.

06:48.617 --> 06:50.812
- I'm listening.
- I heard

06:50.900 --> 06:52.858
through the caterers' grapevine
that there's also

06:52.946 --> 06:55.460
a fundraiser for the Blairsville
Hospital tomorrow night.

06:55.686 --> 06:57.129
They moved it up
at the last minute.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.436
Who moves a fundraiser
at the last minute?

06:59.726 --> 07:01.335
Mayor Davenport.

07:01.576 --> 07:04.866
Of course.

07:07.167 --> 07:09.107
What's up, Nick?

07:09.543 --> 07:12.113
Tyler?! Where have you been?
I haven't seen you

07:12.201 --> 07:13.843
- since freshman year.
- My dad transferred

07:13.930 --> 07:15.615
for his job.
We just moved back.

07:15.703 --> 07:18.358
- Oh, cool!
- So I heard you moved

07:18.499 --> 07:20.107
- into the Grey House.
- I did.

07:20.195 --> 07:22.443
You know that place
is haunted, right?

07:22.546 --> 07:25.834
- Who told you that?
- It's not a secret.

07:27.555 --> 07:30.467
She look familiar?
The Grey Lady?

07:30.889 --> 07:32.394
Rumour has it
that every night

07:32.482 --> 07:34.365
at exactly 11:13,

07:34.453 --> 07:37.185
she roams the halls
looking for Clementine.

07:37.318 --> 07:39.349
- Who's Clementine?
- Nobody knows,

07:39.437 --> 07:41.308
but you can hear
the Grey Lady

07:41.396 --> 07:43.949
calling out the name
"Clementine."

07:44.037 --> 07:46.998
I guess I've heard noises,
but nothing like that.

07:47.086 --> 07:50.269
- Don't worry, you'll hear her.
- Or not.

07:50.701 --> 07:53.664
Well, only one way
to know for sure.

07:53.787 --> 07:57.099
- You want to find Clementine?
- I'm free tonight!

07:57.320 --> 08:00.404
I can't tonight.

08:00.708 --> 08:03.467
You're good tomorrow?
Yeah, definitely.

08:03.555 --> 08:05.670
See you then.

08:07.042 --> 08:09.295
Coconut cream pie,

08:09.390 --> 08:12.905
the ultimate comfort food.
Although I'm sure it didn't go

08:12.993 --> 08:15.994
- as badly as you think.
- You weren't there.

08:16.738 --> 08:19.080
I fell flatter
than a hotcake.

08:19.385 --> 08:23.080
Well, you know what they say,
"Never bet against talent."

08:23.775 --> 08:26.525
And you are the talented
Mrs. Tinsdale.

08:26.697 --> 08:28.588
Well, thank you, Stephanie.

08:28.744 --> 08:30.580
I suppose sometimes
we all just need

08:30.668 --> 08:32.845
to be reminded of the obvious.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.369
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the man

08:37.457 --> 08:39.409
who stole the wedding bouquet
from those of us who might

08:39.496 --> 08:42.346
- have actually wanted it.
- It's not like I dove for it;

08:42.462 --> 08:43.940
it just kind
of magically floated to me.

08:44.027 --> 08:46.346
Uh-huh?
What can I get for you?

08:46.434 --> 08:47.957
Just a coffee to go.

08:48.199 --> 08:50.150
And how do you know
I didn't want to catch it?

08:50.328 --> 08:53.424
Aren't you married to the sea?
Or however that saying goes.

08:53.530 --> 08:55.214
You wouldn't mock it
if you've ever been out there.

08:55.301 --> 08:58.103
- It's kind of transcendent.
- Actually,

08:58.337 --> 09:02.289
my dad used to take me sailing.
Watching the horizon,

09:02.377 --> 09:05.455
the sound of the water;
it was very peaceful.

09:05.543 --> 09:07.197
It was like...

09:07.324 --> 09:08.977
- poetry.
- Poetry.

09:11.775 --> 09:14.307
Jinx. I owe you that coffee.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.838
Oh, nice camera!

09:26.250 --> 09:28.165
It'd be nice
if it worked.

09:28.253 --> 09:31.674
Well, it's nice either way.
It's more useful if it works.

09:32.166 --> 09:34.103
I guess that's true.

09:34.581 --> 09:36.861
It's been acting up lately,
it's kind of hit or miss.

09:36.949 --> 09:39.939
Most people your age
take pictures with their phones.

09:40.027 --> 09:42.041
My dad says
I'm an old soul.

09:42.242 --> 09:45.260
- But I think film looks cool.
- Yeah, I agree.

09:45.348 --> 09:48.455
Really? Everybody thinks
it's too much work.

09:48.543 --> 09:51.978
Hmm... Well, everybody sees
things through a different lens.

09:52.393 --> 09:54.568
Oh. How do you see things?

09:54.884 --> 09:57.596
My glass tends to be
half full.

09:57.738 --> 09:59.432
- I am Cassie by the way.
- Alex.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.678
- Hi.
- You're pretty easy to talk to.

10:01.766 --> 10:04.525
Yes. So are you. How long
have you been a photographer?

10:04.639 --> 10:06.322
Like my whole life.

10:06.410 --> 10:08.432
- Wow!
- I want my pictures to bring

10:08.527 --> 10:11.924
- people together.
- I have no doubt they will.

10:12.227 --> 10:14.619
I like it when they make
people happy.

10:14.978 --> 10:16.850
My dad thinks
I should charge for them.

10:16.938 --> 10:19.636
- What do you think?
- He doesn't get it.

10:19.723 --> 10:22.525
- He's a stockbroker.
- Hm, well, we're pretty far

10:22.613 --> 10:24.385
- from Wall Street.
- I know.

10:24.473 --> 10:27.302
- He owns this place with my aunt.
- Aaah...

10:29.074 --> 10:32.838
They don't really get along.
We hardly ever visit.

10:34.054 --> 10:35.885
Maybe they'll have
a change of heart.

10:36.588 --> 10:38.220
I wish.

10:38.635 --> 10:40.049
I'd love to spend
more time here.

10:40.137 --> 10:43.097
Yeah, it is
a very inspiring place.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.438
I get amazing shots
around the vineyard.

10:45.541 --> 10:47.893
Especially
when my camera's working.

10:48.143 --> 10:50.143
Why don't you give it
another try.

10:55.160 --> 10:57.520
Wow! It worked!

10:57.660 --> 10:59.120
Hm, glass half full.

11:07.331 --> 11:09.098
- Is there a problem?
- You know there is.

11:09.229 --> 11:12.059
Not for me.
My RSVPs are pouring in.

11:12.147 --> 11:13.864
Oh!

11:14.669 --> 11:16.598
- There's another one.
- Stop playing games.

11:16.740 --> 11:18.872
My fundraiser is equally
as important as yours.

11:18.991 --> 11:21.622
- I don't disagree.
- Then reschedule your party.

11:21.710 --> 11:23.122
I can't do that.

11:25.049 --> 11:27.748
But we could join forces.

11:28.114 --> 11:30.137
You want to combine
our fundraisers?

11:30.225 --> 11:32.314
Imagine what we could
accomplish together.

11:32.402 --> 11:34.361
You're not a team player,
what's in this for you?

11:34.449 --> 11:36.302
For me? Nothing.
This is about our hospital

11:36.390 --> 11:38.830
- and your fire department.
- Obviously, you're losing guests;

11:38.920 --> 11:41.536
I-I don't want to take donations
from either cause.

11:41.718 --> 11:44.504
- That's magnanimous.
- Tell your remaining guests

11:44.591 --> 11:45.818
to be here at city hall
by 8 o'clock.

11:45.905 --> 11:47.229
I didn't say I was on board.

11:47.317 --> 11:49.044
You really don't
have a choice.

11:49.489 --> 11:52.247
If I agree to combining
our fundraisers,

11:52.335 --> 11:54.163
then we hold it in Middleton.

11:55.858 --> 11:57.411
How about we flip for it?

11:59.719 --> 12:03.505
- I'll even let you call it.
- Heads.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.894
Heads, your city hall.
Tails, mine.

12:09.044 --> 12:10.700
Don't be late.

12:18.393 --> 12:19.533
If you had to choose,

12:19.636 --> 12:22.762
- the food or the wine?
- Hmm... The company?

12:22.976 --> 12:24.895
- That's a good answer.
- Mm-hmm.

12:25.986 --> 12:28.927
OK, you two look
entirely too happy.

12:29.098 --> 12:30.356
I hope you're enjoying dinner?

12:30.444 --> 12:32.882
- It's delicious.
- I'm glad to hear that.

12:32.970 --> 12:34.553
Well, we weren't glad
to hear that the vineyard

12:34.640 --> 12:37.216
might not be here next year.
I hope that's not true.

12:37.350 --> 12:39.198
I guess you met my brother.
He shouldn't

12:39.286 --> 12:41.387
- have bothered you with that.
- Ah, it wasn't a bother.

12:41.474 --> 12:43.037
We know how much
this place means to you.

12:43.124 --> 12:45.137
I've watched my parents
put everything they had

12:45.225 --> 12:47.825
into making this place
a success, and I'm gonna do

12:47.913 --> 12:49.915
everything I can
to continue the tradition.

12:50.053 --> 12:52.544
There's nothing quite like
a family tradition.

12:52.802 --> 12:54.575
Sometimes, thinking
about yesterday can help

12:54.663 --> 12:56.872
get us through to tomorrow.

12:57.198 --> 12:59.731
Unfortunately, my brother
doesn't think about much

12:59.819 --> 13:02.723
other than the bottom line.
I'm sorry,

13:02.921 --> 13:04.804
I've interrupted your dinner
for too long.

13:04.899 --> 13:06.727
- Enjoy.
- Thanks.

13:55.384 --> 13:57.778
Jump forward in time.

14:35.047 --> 14:36.291
Hmm!

14:53.924 --> 14:56.268
- <i>Are you sure you're OK?</i>
- I'm great!

14:56.550 --> 14:58.613
- That was pretty quick.
- Well, why dwell

14:58.701 --> 15:00.910
in the past
when you can bake muffins?

15:00.998 --> 15:02.869
<i>I'm glad
you're handling it so well.</i>

15:02.957 --> 15:05.832
There's nothing to handle.
Noah is a distant memory.

15:05.920 --> 15:07.835
- Who's Noah?
- Oh! See?

15:08.108 --> 15:10.176
Guess you and Abigail
have it all worked out.

15:10.348 --> 15:12.002
You have nothing
to worry about.

15:12.090 --> 15:14.049
We're fine.
Go back to your honeymoon.

15:14.137 --> 15:16.226
<i>She's right,
go back to your honeymoon.</i>

15:16.373 --> 15:18.157
In that case,
I think I will.

15:18.245 --> 15:20.301
- Have fun.
- Bye.

15:20.699 --> 15:22.582
So we're pretending
nothing happened?

15:22.908 --> 15:24.457
Who's pretending?

15:30.867 --> 15:33.676
Vincent! Could you
give me a hand?

15:33.764 --> 15:34.910
Sure.

15:35.208 --> 15:36.894
Grab one of these boxes.

15:37.422 --> 15:38.597
Thanks.

15:40.659 --> 15:42.158
What's your story, Vincent?

15:42.246 --> 15:43.855
I got a feeling
you've heard my story.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.353
I heard you have
a new outlook. Is that true?

15:46.441 --> 15:49.113
- Haha! I hope so.
- I hope so too.

15:49.222 --> 15:51.548
If not, we're gonna have
a problem.

15:51.636 --> 15:53.557
Oh, I definitely don't want
to get on your bad side.

15:53.644 --> 15:56.986
Smart man.
Now that we've had a little chat,

15:57.074 --> 15:59.176
do me a favour
and drive me to city hall?

16:00.621 --> 16:02.486
Any more favours
I could do for you?

16:02.574 --> 16:04.933
Actually, I'm doing
you a favour.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.144
Oh, hi, Stephanie!

16:15.629 --> 16:19.269
Hey! I am glad you're here.
Try this.

16:19.357 --> 16:21.996
- Salmon?
- Smoked with a bit of dill.

16:22.995 --> 16:26.215
- Wow, that was amazing!
- I take my job very seriously.

16:26.303 --> 16:29.261
I can see that! Makes me wish
I was coming to the party.

16:29.349 --> 16:31.801
- You're not?
- I wasn't invited.

16:32.215 --> 16:34.996
I'm kidding. I have tickets
to see the Blairsville

16:35.084 --> 16:37.152
- Blasters tonight.
- Ugh, I love hockey.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.386
- Why don't you come with me?
- Um, wish I could.

16:39.497 --> 16:41.691
It's their last home game
for a while...

16:41.963 --> 16:44.816
Then I suggest you find
something just as entertaining

16:44.904 --> 16:47.277
another day,
and I might join you.

16:48.332 --> 16:49.644
I might just do that.

16:53.782 --> 16:55.188
Hmm.

16:56.844 --> 16:58.196
Well, this is working up

16:58.284 --> 17:00.618
an appetite.
I could use some pancakes.

17:00.706 --> 17:03.534
- Haha! You read my mind.
- Haha!

17:03.641 --> 17:05.540
Guess the surprise is already
gone out of our marriage.

17:05.627 --> 17:08.789
Yeah, I was hoping that
we would last at least a week.

17:09.233 --> 17:11.496
- You know something I love?
- Hmm?

17:11.662 --> 17:13.916
I know you'll never
stop surprising me.

17:24.191 --> 17:27.377
Good morning. Or is it?

17:27.614 --> 17:29.442
Just examining
this year's crop.

17:29.761 --> 17:31.362
I don't know much
about wine grapes,

17:31.450 --> 17:34.167
but I'm guessing this is not
what you were hoping for.

17:34.355 --> 17:36.074
It's been this way
since Connor and I inherited

17:36.161 --> 17:38.261
the vineyard.
Two bad harvests in a row.

17:38.350 --> 17:40.396
Well, maybe this year
will be the charm.

17:40.831 --> 17:42.448
Maybe if my dad was here.

17:42.536 --> 17:46.597
Hmm... A strong vine may bend,
but it doesn't break.

17:46.699 --> 17:50.230
I hope you're right.

17:54.339 --> 17:56.610
I've got it all
under control, Martha.

17:56.698 --> 17:59.173
Planning these events can turn
even the most capable person

17:59.261 --> 18:00.734
into a ball of nerves.

18:00.821 --> 18:02.780
I've seen it happen
time and time again.

18:02.867 --> 18:04.738
Well, you won't see
it happen this time.

18:05.019 --> 18:07.448
My party is going
to be amazing.

18:07.536 --> 18:10.446
I remember when the mayor's
annual fundraiser was my party.

18:13.292 --> 18:15.337
OK, breathe. Just breathe.

18:15.425 --> 18:17.956
You are the talented
Mrs. Tinsdale.

18:18.105 --> 18:21.269
Ahem! Martha Tinsdale!

18:21.909 --> 18:24.363
Oh, hello, Theodore.

18:24.644 --> 18:27.956
Yes. Oh yes!

18:28.118 --> 18:30.026
Well, of course.

18:32.782 --> 18:34.011
Oh!

18:34.946 --> 18:36.722
Uh, no, no, no.

18:36.810 --> 18:39.292
Um, thank you anyway.

18:41.110 --> 18:42.589
What did he say?

18:43.518 --> 18:46.206
First, I'm unjustly removed
from office, and now this.

18:46.409 --> 18:48.217
My star is dimming.

18:49.393 --> 18:50.665
Don't worry,
it's not like

18:50.753 --> 18:52.830
you can't show
your face around town.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.597
You know where I can show
my face? At your party.

18:57.743 --> 18:59.014
At my party?

18:59.102 --> 19:01.167
Theodore Carter will be
one of your guests.

19:01.255 --> 19:03.423
It could be
the perfect opportunity

19:03.511 --> 19:05.431
for a second-chance schmooze.

19:05.519 --> 19:09.394
- You are the queen of schmooze.
- Awww, thank you.

19:14.243 --> 19:16.462
Oh, hey. Taking pictures
to remember the place?

19:16.690 --> 19:18.563
Erin's done a great job
keeping it on.

19:18.651 --> 19:21.032
- Maybe you should tell her.
- She doesn't want to hear

19:21.119 --> 19:23.706
anything from me.
I'm the New Yorker.

19:23.794 --> 19:25.878
Hmm! Yeah, I was too.

19:26.503 --> 19:29.753
I'd see more patients in a day
than I see in a month now.

19:29.956 --> 19:32.454
I don't miss that grind.
You gave it up?

19:32.542 --> 19:34.886
Yeah. For things
that matter.

19:35.034 --> 19:37.614
Spend more time with son,
less time dealing

19:37.722 --> 19:40.138
- with stress.
- I get it.

19:40.480 --> 19:43.185
I remember when I first started.
I loved the action.

19:43.272 --> 19:45.188
You know, the buying
and the selling

19:45.276 --> 19:48.011
and the expensive lunches
and the fancy suits and...

19:48.808 --> 19:50.501
now I just feel burnt out.

19:50.589 --> 19:53.464
Be careful. It's easy
to bring that home with you.

19:53.839 --> 19:56.050
- Yeah, I guess.
- Please stop bothering guests.

19:56.138 --> 19:58.440
Haha! I'm the one
bothering him.

19:58.745 --> 20:01.058
I was just gonna come
looking from you.

20:02.018 --> 20:04.251
I found someone who's interested
in buying the vineyard.

20:04.339 --> 20:06.206
I already told you
the vineyard's not for sale.

20:06.294 --> 20:09.173
This guy can bring this place
back to its glory days.

20:09.261 --> 20:11.952
He even agreed to continue
bottling under the family name.

20:12.039 --> 20:13.923
Don't act like you care
about the family name.

20:14.011 --> 20:16.348
Erin, don't let emotion
get in the way of business.

20:16.435 --> 20:18.644
I'm gonna give you guys
some privacy.

20:18.739 --> 20:20.455
What's the point?

20:26.785 --> 20:29.097
I know exactly
what Connor's going through.

20:29.440 --> 20:31.034
I hope he thinks
about what I said.

20:31.229 --> 20:32.683
I mean you're
the perfect example

20:32.779 --> 20:34.886
- of how to push past that.
- If I hadn't,

20:34.974 --> 20:36.418
- we wouldn't be on our honeymoon.
- Haha!

20:36.505 --> 20:38.072
Fate always finds a way.

20:39.307 --> 20:42.266
- Hello, Alex.
- Hey, Cassie!

20:42.354 --> 20:45.409
Oh, um,
this is my husband, Sam.

20:45.784 --> 20:47.972
I think that's the first time
I've heard you say that.

20:48.281 --> 20:51.120
- We're newlyweds.
- Cool! Congrats.

20:51.339 --> 20:53.628
Any chance you guys are headed
back? I've been taking pics

20:53.716 --> 20:56.667
- and got all turned around.
- Follow us.

21:03.932 --> 21:06.221
Aw, that's awesome!

21:06.769 --> 21:10.190
- I gotta show my followers.
- How many do you have?

21:10.331 --> 21:13.042
- Over 10000.
- Oh!

21:19.355 --> 21:21.275
- That's a problem.
- What's wrong?

21:21.363 --> 21:23.120
My shutter jammed.

21:23.749 --> 21:25.839
I guess you'll have
to come back later.

21:37.709 --> 21:39.798
Ready to bust some ghosts?!

21:39.979 --> 21:42.634
I forgot how much you get
into this stuff.

21:42.736 --> 21:43.886
"This stuff"?

21:43.974 --> 21:46.745
This is some serious
ghost-finding business.

21:47.198 --> 21:49.714
Ah, there she is.

21:50.827 --> 21:54.309
- Now what?
- Now, we wait for her to speak.

21:55.788 --> 21:58.182
I just remembered.
When I first moved here,

21:58.269 --> 22:01.214
you tried to convince me that
Bigfoot lived in Foster's Woods.

22:01.302 --> 22:04.623
Bigfoot is child's play
compared to this.

22:06.336 --> 22:07.519
What was that?

22:07.683 --> 22:09.980
Maybe it's the Grey Lady.

22:10.502 --> 22:12.983
I have an app for that.
Hmm!

22:13.322 --> 22:15.480
- What are you two doing?
- Would you believe

22:15.568 --> 22:18.593
- we're ghost hunting?
- Same old Tyler.

22:18.855 --> 22:22.902
The app shows that there's
electromagnetic energy upstairs.

22:23.581 --> 22:24.904
Meaning what?

22:25.120 --> 22:26.839
Ghosts. A lot of them.

22:27.409 --> 22:29.870
You may have too much time
on your hands.

22:32.628 --> 22:34.697
Sorry, I was joking.

22:34.964 --> 22:36.636
Oh, it's cool.

22:36.829 --> 22:38.831
We should head upstairs.

22:39.128 --> 22:41.269
Yeah, well, I'm, uh,
I'm gonna bake, so...

22:41.542 --> 22:43.261
You've been baking
a lot lately.

22:43.349 --> 22:46.178
- When I feel good, I bake.
- Didn't...

22:46.317 --> 22:48.711
you and Noah just break up?

22:48.798 --> 22:50.534
That feels like weeks ago.

22:58.252 --> 23:00.144
A few feet further back.

23:01.386 --> 23:03.081
More.

23:03.465 --> 23:04.847
A little more.

23:05.902 --> 23:07.097
Perfect!

23:07.534 --> 23:09.589
It is a perfect night,
isn't it?

23:10.495 --> 23:11.767
I didn't see you come in.

23:11.855 --> 23:14.650
- And yet here I am.
- Mm-hmm. What do you think?

23:14.955 --> 23:17.391
I think my city hall is nicer
than your city hall.

23:17.479 --> 23:18.909
You just can't
help yourself,

23:18.997 --> 23:20.738
- can you?
- It's part of my charm.

23:20.826 --> 23:22.654
I suppose it is.

23:24.690 --> 23:25.813
What?

23:25.901 --> 23:29.355
- You look stunning.
- Just not as stunning as you?

23:29.526 --> 23:31.456
"You just can't help
yourself, can you?"

23:31.643 --> 23:34.933
- "It's part of my charm."
- I hope you're just as charming

23:35.065 --> 23:37.605
- when you give your speech.
- What speech?

23:37.716 --> 23:40.709
Host of the fundraiser always
gives the speech. It's tradition.

23:40.797 --> 23:42.698
Nobody told me
about this tradition.

23:42.786 --> 23:46.823
- Well, I'm telling you now.
- No problem.

23:56.822 --> 23:58.800
Fancy meeting you here.

23:59.246 --> 24:02.339
Well, it is a fundraiser
for the hospital.

24:02.427 --> 24:05.526
As chaplain, I thought it should
help guilt people into donating.

24:05.614 --> 24:08.315
Hmm... I didn't know chaplains
were allowed to be funny.

24:08.403 --> 24:11.519
- I also knew you'd be here.
- You wanted to see me?

24:11.630 --> 24:13.110
Mm-hmm.

24:13.854 --> 24:15.862
I thought you were
dealing with some things.

24:16.112 --> 24:17.323
I was.

24:17.580 --> 24:19.175
But now you're not?

24:19.541 --> 24:22.597
My fiancée and I split up,
and I've just

24:22.798 --> 24:24.495
kind of been laying low
ever since.

24:24.583 --> 24:27.159
I am... so sorry.
That must be hard.

24:27.247 --> 24:28.706
No. No, no.

24:28.794 --> 24:31.925
Meeting you has, uh...
made it a little easier.

24:32.480 --> 24:33.603
Ah...

24:35.215 --> 24:37.630
Oh, I gotta get
back to work.

24:37.809 --> 24:40.192
Right. Have a great night.

24:44.833 --> 24:46.263
Welcome, everybody,

24:46.434 --> 24:47.802
and thank you again

24:47.890 --> 24:52.888
for supporting our mayor's
or, shall I say, co-mayors'

24:53.364 --> 24:55.192
annual fundraiser.

24:55.577 --> 24:57.231
I want to thank Mayor Pershing

24:57.319 --> 24:59.408
for opening up city hall
so we can honour

24:59.496 --> 25:01.598
the great women and men
of our communities.

25:01.786 --> 25:05.059
And as it's tradition
to hear from the host,

25:05.567 --> 25:09.137
Madam Mayor, the floor is yours.

25:14.091 --> 25:15.512
I was unaware
of this tradition

25:15.615 --> 25:17.879
until just a few minutes ago,
so I don't have

25:17.967 --> 25:19.645
a speech prepared.

25:20.926 --> 25:22.074
But I can tell you

25:22.162 --> 25:24.176
what I've noticed
in the short time

25:24.264 --> 25:26.048
we've been here this evening.

25:26.675 --> 25:30.582
Middleton and Blairsville
have not always seen eye to eye,

25:30.778 --> 25:33.528
but tonight
we've put aside

25:33.615 --> 25:35.457
our differences to come together

25:35.545 --> 25:37.856
for two great causes.

25:38.084 --> 25:40.418
And when we value
each other's strengths,

25:40.883 --> 25:43.051
great things can happen.

25:44.614 --> 25:47.582
So here's to our brave
first responders

25:47.670 --> 25:49.977
and our dedicated
hospital staff.

25:50.336 --> 25:53.473
Thank you for your service,
your sacrifice

25:53.631 --> 25:55.937
and your selflessness.

25:56.025 --> 25:58.463
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

26:03.922 --> 26:05.663
The key to the perfect s'more

26:05.821 --> 26:08.998
is charring the marshmallow,
not burning it.

26:09.085 --> 26:10.770
I like burnt
marshmallows.

26:11.000 --> 26:13.791
- That's not possible.
- It's totally possible.

26:13.879 --> 26:16.637
I guess there's more than one
way to make the perfect s'more.

26:16.823 --> 26:20.332
Your grandpa used to roast
the best marshmallows.

26:20.881 --> 26:23.176
And your dad would grab them
when they were too hot.

26:23.264 --> 26:25.761
- He never learned to wait.
- He's still kind of that way.

26:26.535 --> 26:28.457
What way?

26:28.957 --> 26:30.840
You're kind of impatient.

26:30.957 --> 26:33.496
Haha! Sometimes,
things need to get done.

26:34.292 --> 26:36.871
Which is why I filed a petition
to divide the property.

26:36.982 --> 26:39.207
You wanna split the vineyard?

26:39.295 --> 26:41.535
This way, you can do whatever
you want with your half.

26:41.623 --> 26:43.088
Well, you know
that's never gonna work!

26:43.175 --> 26:45.051
- It can work if you just...
- Guys...

26:46.824 --> 26:48.231
Sorry, Alex.

26:48.339 --> 26:50.994
Sweetheart, I need you
to pack your things.

26:51.053 --> 26:54.028
We're going home in the morning.

26:57.466 --> 26:59.239
Is your arm hurting?

26:59.787 --> 27:02.059
Uh, it'll be OK.

27:02.809 --> 27:04.314
Let's go check you out.

27:13.232 --> 27:16.457
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

27:21.387 --> 27:25.086
You think it's a heart attack?
No. Left arm is heart attack;

27:25.205 --> 27:28.295
right arm's generally stress.
Take a couple of deep breaths.

27:31.871 --> 27:33.965
OK, good.

27:34.638 --> 27:36.903
I'm guessing it's not the first
time this has happened.

27:39.262 --> 27:41.220
No, it's been going on
about six months.

27:41.605 --> 27:44.723
Coming home shouldn't add
to your stress.

27:45.668 --> 27:47.223
I gotta get
this vineyard sold,

27:47.311 --> 27:49.051
and then I can
calm down.

27:49.586 --> 27:52.356
Well, if you don't, the next
one may be a heart attack.

27:58.931 --> 28:00.387
Theodore?

28:01.105 --> 28:04.167
My... you're looking dapper.

28:04.660 --> 28:07.520
You know, I was thinking
how we go back a long way...

28:07.608 --> 28:09.418
You don't have
to save face, Martha,

28:09.506 --> 28:12.151
- I know you weren't on your game.
- Perhaps, will that compel you

28:12.239 --> 28:13.973
to give an old friend
a second chance?

28:14.061 --> 28:16.733
That wouldn't be fair to the
other candidates, you know that.

28:16.821 --> 28:20.715
Of course. Well then,
just enjoy the festivities.

28:21.810 --> 28:23.926
It's that... Ahem!

28:24.332 --> 28:26.265
Time. Ahem!

28:26.352 --> 28:29.067
Sorry. Time...

28:34.403 --> 28:35.840
Are you alright?

28:35.973 --> 28:38.323
My voice is gone.

28:43.925 --> 28:46.265
Yoohoo! Excuse me.

28:46.354 --> 28:49.286
Attention! Haha!
It's time to play

28:49.374 --> 28:52.731
a little game that I like
to call Martha says.

28:52.856 --> 28:55.012
So, everybody,
raise your glass,

28:55.106 --> 28:58.428
Ah! Ah! Ah!
I didn't say, "Martha says."

28:58.515 --> 29:01.418
Alright, now round 2.

29:01.658 --> 29:05.856
Martha says give Mayor Pershing
and Mayor Davenport

29:05.981 --> 29:08.133
some well-deserved applause

29:08.220 --> 29:10.353
for co-hosting
this extraordinary evening.

29:14.062 --> 29:16.325
And now that you're
in a giving mood,

29:16.442 --> 29:19.773
Martha says take out
your chequebooks.

29:20.586 --> 29:22.644
Come on now, don't be shy.

29:22.732 --> 29:25.530
And most important,
Martha says

29:25.646 --> 29:28.780
be the charitable people
that I know you are.

29:28.976 --> 29:30.707
Thank you.

29:38.731 --> 29:40.722
It won't be easy
just to walk away.

29:40.810 --> 29:42.832
But you never have to walk
away from your memories.

29:43.000 --> 29:45.046
Tonight's one
I'd like to forget.

29:46.993 --> 29:48.222
Have any of you seen Alex?

29:48.310 --> 29:49.996
Not since you sent her
to pack.

29:50.084 --> 29:51.808
I've looked everywhere,
she's gone.

29:52.636 --> 29:54.682
If she's anything like
my daughter, she's constantly

29:54.770 --> 29:57.746
posting pictures
and tagging them. Here.

29:59.260 --> 30:01.275
Of course, the swing.

30:01.363 --> 30:03.253
She just posted
10 minutes ago.

30:03.341 --> 30:06.050
- Where is it?
- Not too far.

30:08.720 --> 30:11.878
My, you certainly are
a giver!

30:11.966 --> 30:15.796
Your donation is most
appreciated, thank you.

30:16.287 --> 30:18.942
Now, that was
the Martha I hoped

30:19.030 --> 30:20.535
would be
at the audition.

30:21.128 --> 30:24.293
Very impressive. It's exactly
what the show needs.

30:24.502 --> 30:26.160
Well, if I didn't
know any better,

30:26.248 --> 30:28.707
it sounds like you're offering
me a second chance.

30:28.866 --> 30:31.152
Actually, Martha,
I'm offering you the job.

30:34.403 --> 30:36.187
I promise you

30:36.352 --> 30:39.469
it'll be the best decision
you've ever made.

30:39.572 --> 30:41.923
We'll make Middleton
our own little Tinseltown.

30:42.085 --> 30:44.342
Or "Tinsdaletown."

30:55.607 --> 30:58.985
I'm sorry you and Noah broke up,
but these muffins are good.

30:59.073 --> 31:01.750
My baking has
nothing to do with Noah.

31:02.491 --> 31:03.758
If you say so.

31:04.202 --> 31:06.642
I haven't thought
about him once today.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.384
Any ghosts?

31:08.680 --> 31:10.836
No paranormal activity
in the kitchen.

31:10.924 --> 31:14.000
- Maybe we should just call it.
- Why? I've got all night.

31:14.088 --> 31:15.906
- Don't you have to go home?
- Not really.

31:16.112 --> 31:17.681
My parents work late.

31:19.086 --> 31:21.586
Wait. I've got something.

31:21.750 --> 31:24.328
- What? Seriously?
- Shh, shh, shh!

31:24.649 --> 31:27.094
It's coming from the hallway.

31:29.126 --> 31:32.563
- Did he just shush us?
- The guy knows his ghosts.

31:38.436 --> 31:40.235
Nick, over here.

31:40.468 --> 31:44.156
Got a strong signal.
Maybe it's the Grey Lady.

31:44.492 --> 31:47.024
Uh, no, it's
too early for her.

31:47.112 --> 31:49.844
But it could be
Clementine.

31:58.650 --> 32:02.001
- Did you do that?
- Clementine.

32:06.410 --> 32:07.742
Tyler?

32:15.762 --> 32:17.219
Alex!

32:18.454 --> 32:20.673
I was so worried about you.

32:21.055 --> 32:22.501
I'm worried too.

32:22.688 --> 32:25.813
- About what?
- Our family.

32:26.190 --> 32:28.016
I don't think we should leave.

32:29.063 --> 32:31.320
I haven't up here in ages.

32:31.695 --> 32:33.655
Oh, this swing!

32:35.521 --> 32:38.110
Dad used to push us
on this when we were kids.

32:38.328 --> 32:40.758
- Grandpa?
- Yeah.

32:42.078 --> 32:44.508
I bet you two need
some time to talk,

32:44.603 --> 32:47.882
and we need some honeymoon
photos under the stars.

32:48.024 --> 32:49.680
Exactly
what I was thinking.

32:49.852 --> 32:53.285
Alex, would you mind taking
some pictures of Sam and me?

33:20.420 --> 33:23.297
- Don't judge me, I earned this.
- Oh, I'm not judging.

33:23.497 --> 33:25.070
I'm joining.

33:29.355 --> 33:33.328
Nice speech. You may have
a future in this yet.

33:35.496 --> 33:37.498
You really love it,
don't you?

33:37.750 --> 33:39.289
I do.

33:39.813 --> 33:41.684
Even the calls about potholes

33:41.772 --> 33:42.969
and pigeons?

33:43.159 --> 33:45.508
Especially the calls
about potholes and pigeons.

33:46.250 --> 33:48.239
It's how I get
to know the people.

33:48.461 --> 33:50.415
People aren't really my thing.

33:50.711 --> 33:52.344
What is your thing?

33:53.946 --> 33:55.375
Cupcakes.

33:58.519 --> 34:00.149
To cupcakes.

34:06.876 --> 34:08.585
- Tyler's gone.
- He went home?

34:08.674 --> 34:10.981
No, he... disappeared.

34:12.362 --> 34:14.277
You think
the Grey Lady got him?

34:14.426 --> 34:16.994
- Or Clementine.
- Who's Clementine?

34:17.081 --> 34:18.277
Nobody knows.

34:19.527 --> 34:21.289
I've got terrible news.

34:21.474 --> 34:24.024
- What?
- I haven't found anything.

34:24.188 --> 34:25.719
Where were you?

34:25.806 --> 34:27.884
When Grace turned off
the lights, I went outside to go

34:27.971 --> 34:29.789
look around.
How did you know it was me?

34:29.889 --> 34:32.804
Who else was it gonna be?
There's no such thing

34:32.891 --> 34:34.445
- as ghosts.
- Maybe not,

34:34.533 --> 34:36.453
but I sure had fun
scaring the both of you.

34:36.572 --> 34:38.649
Wait. If there's

34:38.737 --> 34:40.783
no such thing as ghosts, then...

34:41.161 --> 34:42.891
why are you here?

34:46.041 --> 34:48.522
Maybe he just
wanted to hang out.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.696
I guess I should go home.

34:56.788 --> 35:00.060
Or maybe you could stay,

35:00.148 --> 35:03.521
and we'll watch a movie.

35:04.083 --> 35:05.881
Yeah. That'd be pretty cool.

35:05.969 --> 35:08.303
- Hmm!
- And by the way,

35:08.391 --> 35:11.748
I loved how you whispered
"Clementine."

35:12.185 --> 35:14.053
I didn't whisper anything.

35:26.336 --> 35:30.427
- I think we should go out.
- Excuse me?

35:30.616 --> 35:32.396
I'd like to go
on that date with you.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.346
I'd like to go
on that date with you.

35:36.967 --> 35:38.365
But I'm not going to.

35:39.434 --> 35:41.743
I don't want to be
the rebound girl.

35:42.131 --> 35:44.154
I don't want you
to be either.

35:46.160 --> 35:48.336
You're making this
very difficult for me.

35:48.424 --> 35:50.889
Then just say yes.

35:52.339 --> 35:53.698
Yes.

35:54.506 --> 35:56.139
Just not right now.

35:57.566 --> 35:59.178
Fair enough.

36:07.030 --> 36:09.545
Seeing you on that
brings back a lot of memories.

36:09.658 --> 36:11.139
Any of them good?

36:11.363 --> 36:14.236
- All of them.
- Really?

36:15.122 --> 36:17.240
'Cause you couldn't wait
to leave home.

36:17.375 --> 36:19.490
Your life was here,
mine wasn't.

36:22.457 --> 36:24.084
I'm sorry.

36:25.048 --> 36:27.181
I'm just frustrated.

36:31.193 --> 36:34.084
Do you remember
why Dad only built one swing?

36:34.475 --> 36:35.905
So we'd share.

36:36.842 --> 36:38.295
I miss those days.

36:38.565 --> 36:40.287
Me too.

36:47.070 --> 36:48.873
Alex hates New York.

36:49.717 --> 36:51.076
She told me.

36:51.638 --> 36:53.639
Did she tell you
I hate it too?

36:54.998 --> 36:56.100
You do?

36:56.295 --> 36:58.670
Yeah. And for a while now.

36:59.045 --> 37:01.432
- It's changed.
- Maybe you have.

37:01.857 --> 37:03.740
I know how much
this place means to you.

37:03.828 --> 37:07.084
- Then help me save it.
- I wish I could.

37:08.305 --> 37:10.928
It means just
as much to me, Erin.

37:15.861 --> 37:18.037
Thank you.
Good night.

37:19.132 --> 37:21.060
It was
a good party, Red.

37:21.547 --> 37:24.507
I'm sorry, did you just
call me "Red"?

37:24.935 --> 37:26.631
I thought I'd try it out.

37:27.154 --> 37:28.807
Try again.

37:30.212 --> 37:32.490
I'd rather try this.

37:34.267 --> 37:36.889
Well, this is awkward.
Sorry to interrupt,

37:36.977 --> 37:38.761
but I seem to have
left my keys somewhere.

37:38.849 --> 37:40.590
You're not
interrupting anything.

37:41.131 --> 37:43.107
I was just leaving.

37:43.422 --> 37:44.818
- Good night, ladies.
- Good night.

37:44.914 --> 37:47.003
Good night. Haha!

37:50.430 --> 37:52.209
You are playing with fire.

37:52.366 --> 37:54.542
He is a Davenport,
and you are a Merriwick.

37:54.630 --> 37:56.577
I know where you're going
with this, but I don't have

37:56.664 --> 37:58.912
- the energy.
- Your romance is doomed.

37:59.000 --> 38:00.523
Because of
a 200-year-old curse?

38:00.611 --> 38:03.678
Yes! When Patience broke off
her engagement to Roderick,

38:03.766 --> 38:05.951
it was the beginning
of the end for every Merriwick

38:06.039 --> 38:07.685
and Davenport couple ever since.

38:07.773 --> 38:10.297
Well, it's a good thing that
Donovan and I aren't a couple.

38:10.480 --> 38:12.154
Heed my words.

38:12.242 --> 38:14.737
Heed my words.
Good night.

38:14.825 --> 38:16.268
Oh!

38:26.110 --> 38:27.391
I don't get why everybody

38:27.479 --> 38:29.508
is so surprised
that I'm not sad about it.

38:29.695 --> 38:31.641
Because breakups
can be really tough.

38:31.729 --> 38:33.414
Well, not this one.

38:33.578 --> 38:35.393
Don't you think
you have enough muffins?

38:35.807 --> 38:37.610
You can never have
enough muffins.

38:37.746 --> 38:39.835
Didn't you say
they were Noah's favourites?

38:40.288 --> 38:42.445
Whatever. Doesn't matter.

38:42.656 --> 38:45.430
- It should matter.
- But I...

38:45.849 --> 38:48.086
I really don't feel a thing.

38:48.274 --> 38:50.408
Well, that's because
you're not allowing yourself to.

38:51.486 --> 38:52.742
So?

38:52.830 --> 38:54.992
So, you can't just
fast-forward to the part

38:55.080 --> 38:57.344
where you feel better.
You need to

38:58.474 --> 39:00.824
go through the pain
to help you heal.

39:01.572 --> 39:04.500
Hmm. And if I don't?

39:05.258 --> 39:07.195
If you don't,

39:07.789 --> 39:09.978
you're gonna be baking
a lot more of these.

39:47.392 --> 39:50.480
We've had an amazing honeymoon.
Thank you for being

39:50.568 --> 39:52.439
- such a wonderful host.
- Thank you for being

39:52.527 --> 39:54.910
- such wonderful guests.
- Hmm, it's not easy

39:54.998 --> 39:58.879
- to say goodbye to this place.
- It's not easy for us either.

39:58.967 --> 40:00.340
Dad!

40:01.023 --> 40:03.504
The grapes!
The grapes!

40:03.592 --> 40:05.644
- What happened?
- They're back!

40:10.078 --> 40:12.199
Look!

40:13.027 --> 40:15.425
Look how rich the colour is,
they've never been

40:15.513 --> 40:18.035
- this beautiful!
- How is this even possible?

40:18.162 --> 40:19.629
Don't you remember
when we were kids?

40:19.717 --> 40:22.488
This happened once before.
I guess you just never know.

40:22.614 --> 40:26.114
Well, if this section ripened,
I bet we can bring back the rest.

40:26.363 --> 40:28.324
Maybe we should
hold off on selling.

40:30.967 --> 40:33.274
Sounds like you'll be
pretty busy for a while.

40:33.832 --> 40:35.668
I'll never be able
to do this on my own.

40:35.756 --> 40:37.802
Well, I guess
it'll be a family effort.

40:38.300 --> 40:39.996
I couldn't agree more.

40:40.302 --> 40:43.762
- Does that mean we can stay?
- Uh...

40:43.858 --> 40:48.293
- I think that's up to Aunt Erin.
- I would love that.

40:52.245 --> 40:53.957
There you go.

40:55.408 --> 40:58.015
- Guess what I found.
- Aaah...

40:58.103 --> 41:00.410
something as entertaining
as a hockey game?

41:00.497 --> 41:02.496
- Who told you?
- What is it?

41:03.021 --> 41:04.293
Fancy food,

41:04.381 --> 41:07.012
a warm fire and good company.

41:07.547 --> 41:09.098
Sounds romantic.

41:09.707 --> 41:11.277
Is it a date?

41:18.514 --> 41:19.887
Stephanie?

41:19.985 --> 41:21.769
Uh, yes. It's a date.

41:24.245 --> 41:26.941
So, um,

41:27.029 --> 41:29.161
stomping grapes
is not on my bucket list.

41:29.249 --> 41:31.559
Come on, when are we gonna get
another chance to do this?

41:31.647 --> 41:33.941
It's really cool, especially
when the grapes squish

41:34.029 --> 41:37.035
- between your toes.
- Now, there's no way

41:37.138 --> 41:39.191
I'm getting in that barrel.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.433
- That looks fun.
- Yeah.

41:55.584 --> 41:57.703
You're thinking about Noah?

41:58.596 --> 42:00.633
Constantly.

42:00.721 --> 42:02.680
I know, it's painful.

42:03.066 --> 42:05.329
And I know I have
to go through it.

42:05.603 --> 42:08.102
But you don't have
to do it alone.

42:10.615 --> 42:12.312
Awww...

42:12.533 --> 42:15.422
I love this movie.

42:15.533 --> 42:18.289
He leaves her waiting on top
of the Empire State Building?

42:18.377 --> 42:19.430
We're definitely gonna

42:19.556 --> 42:21.227
- need more Rocky Road.
- Mm-hmm!

42:21.314 --> 42:22.852
Hm-Mmm.
