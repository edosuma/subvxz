02:47.668 --> 02:50.546
<i>As you can see,
Lynn never breaks her dog's rhythm.</i>

02:50.587 --> 02:52.506
<i>She uses rapid-fire, multiple disks,</i>

02:52.548 --> 02:55.926
<i>throwing them high to display
Muffy's wonderful coordination and agility.</i>

02:55.926 --> 02:59.471
<i>A terrific exhibition
by last year's runners-up.</i>

02:59.513 --> 03:02.182
<i>Next up, Judith Lynman and Rocky.</i>

03:02.224 --> 03:06.061
<i>Watch how Rocky doesn't take off...
Watch this one,</i>

03:06.103 --> 03:07.980
Wow! Let's try it,

03:08.021 --> 03:10.274
Come on, Bruiser, give it to me, Drop it,

03:10.274 --> 03:14.152
Let it go, Bruiser, Let it go,
Let it go, Come on,

03:15.112 --> 03:18.657
<i>Strong toss, and he catches it!</i>

03:20.784 --> 03:23.620
Go on, Bruiser, get it, Get it,

03:25.956 --> 03:29.334
<i>Easy, even toss, and he grabs it.</i>

03:29.376 --> 03:33.630
Go! Get it, Bruiser,
Wanna get it? Look! Look!

03:33.672 --> 03:36.800
Jump, Bruiser! Oh, man!

03:36.842 --> 03:41.346
<i>Winner of the 1978 South Florida
Frisbee Dog Championship</i>

03:41.388 --> 03:43.390
<i>is Judith Lynman and Rocky!</i>

03:43.390 --> 03:45.309
I'm gonna teach you real hard.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.436
All right, boys, let's go,
What do you say?

03:47.477 --> 03:51.315
That dumb dog will never
learn to catch a Frisbee.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.483
He will so, and don't call him dumb!

03:53.525 --> 03:55.944
How about retarded?

03:55.986 --> 03:58.405
Some day he's gonna win that
championship.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.365
Don't make me laugh.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.000
<i>All right, guys, I guess...</i>

04:19.927 --> 04:22.137
You know, Bill,
I don't really feel like cooking tonight.

04:22.179 --> 04:26.099
You don't have to cook, We'll get
in the boat and get some hamburgers,

04:26.141 --> 04:30.229
Guess what, David's got the
hots for Jennifer Bradley.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.524
- Shut up, you dehydrated pizza face,
- Dad, he's knuckling me!

04:33.565 --> 04:36.652
David! Just stop provoking
your little brother, please,

04:36.693 --> 04:38.445
- But, Dad!
- No, really!

04:38.487 --> 04:42.616
That's the last I wanna hear from both of
you, Now give us a break,

04:42.658 --> 04:44.660
I can't believe this,

04:47.037 --> 04:50.165
<i>Dad, can I play at Billy's?</i>

04:50.207 --> 04:52.709
Yeah, I guess so,
Just look out for the fireworks,

04:52.709 --> 04:55.212
<i>Make sure you be back before
dark.</i>

04:55.212 --> 04:56.922
Give me that.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.382
- Weasel!
- Dork!

04:58.382 --> 05:00.884
- Butt-face!
- Scuzz-bucket!

05:01.969 --> 05:06.056
You'll never see your ninth birthday,
I promise!

05:18.402 --> 05:20.737
<i>I wish you two
would try to get along.</i>

05:20.779 --> 05:23.699
- He's a jerk,
- Ah, come on, it's just a phase.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.034
- He'll grow out of it,
- If he lives that long.

05:26.076 --> 05:28.328
Is that any way to
talk about your little brother?

05:28.370 --> 05:29.997
No, I guess not.

05:29.997 --> 05:31.874
Just try and remember
you're the oldest, all right?

05:31.915 --> 05:33.709
All right, all right.

05:33.750 --> 05:37.462
- Hi, David.
- Hi, Jennifer.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.051
<i>Hi, Jennifer,</i>

05:43.093 --> 05:48.056
<i>- Finally!
- What took you so long?</i>

05:48.098 --> 05:50.350
Hey, think fast!

05:54.146 --> 05:58.358
Honey, stay out of the refrigerator,
We're going out to dinner soon.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.278
Don't worry, I'll be hungry.

06:01.320 --> 06:04.114
- Come on, boy,
- Do you know how to open these?

06:04.156 --> 06:06.116
- Yes, I do, dear,
- Thank you,

06:06.116 --> 06:10.370
<i>On the fourth
of July, 1978, an American Top 40 extra.</i>

06:10.412 --> 06:12.331
- David.
- Dad!

06:12.372 --> 06:18.462
<i>- Aren't you gonna watch the game?
- I was just...watching the boats.</i>

06:18.504 --> 06:19.755
Oh, Yeah?

06:25.886 --> 06:28.555
Oh.

06:30.974 --> 06:34.353
So, you do have a crush
on Jennifer Bradley,

06:34.811 --> 06:38.732
Nah, not really,
I barely even know her.

06:41.652 --> 06:44.571
Have you ever tried talking to her?

06:44.613 --> 06:47.533
How're you supposed to talk to girls?

06:48.033 --> 06:50.327
It's impossible.

06:50.369 --> 06:54.122
Well, you just have to try
to strike up a conversation,

06:54.164 --> 06:57.835
Hi! How you doin'?
That's a nice bike.

06:57.876 --> 07:01.088
If you're gonna learn to swim,
you just gotta jump in the water,

07:01.129 --> 07:05.259
- I guess.
- David? Don't forget to feed Bruiser,

07:05.300 --> 07:07.553
I won't.

07:07.594 --> 07:09.680
Come on, Bruiser.

07:12.516 --> 07:16.854
Good boy, That'll make you big and strong
so you can win that championship,

07:16.895 --> 07:20.732
David? David.
Oh, would you go meet Jeff?

07:20.774 --> 07:23.235
The Johnsons said he left
about five minutes ago,

07:23.277 --> 07:25.320
- He's eight years old, Mom,
- I know.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.781
But I don't like him going
through the woods alone.

07:27.823 --> 07:29.825
I think he can make it
a half-mile on his own.

07:29.867 --> 07:32.661
Now, you hurry up,
And we're gonna get some burgers

07:32.703 --> 07:35.455
and we're gonna set off
those fireworks of yours,

07:35.497 --> 07:37.875
- OK?
- OK.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.336
Come on, Bruiser.

07:57.644 --> 08:01.398
What is it, macho man?
Not afraid of a little wind, are you?

08:07.571 --> 08:09.406
See, Bruiser?

08:09.448 --> 08:12.159
What you gotta do is be
 a take-charge guy,

08:12.201 --> 08:14.703
That's what girls like.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.927
Come on, boy.

08:29.927 --> 08:31.595
Come on.

08:33.429 --> 08:35.515
Wanna know my real problem?

08:36.808 --> 08:39.977
I don't know what I want
out of life anymore.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.982
<i>As a young dog, you might find that
hard to understand, but...</i>

08:46.401 --> 08:48.445
Jeff?

08:51.907 --> 08:53.784
Jeff?

09:21.478 --> 09:24.398
Get back, Jack! I've got a gun!

09:51.967 --> 09:54.261
- Oh!
- Gotcha! Gotcha!

09:54.303 --> 09:56.263
<i>- I'll kill you!</i>

09:59.349 --> 10:01.476
Bruiser?

10:09.860 --> 10:11.904
What is it, Bruiser?

10:17.034 --> 10:20.037
Come on, boy,
We'd better get home.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.584
Agh!

10:48.649 --> 10:51.902
Bruiser! Here, Bruiser,

11:09.336 --> 11:11.421
Bruiser? Here, Bruiser.

11:13.257 --> 11:17.177
Open up, you little punk!
Do you hear me?

11:17.678 --> 11:19.972
I said open up!

11:23.684 --> 11:26.603
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

11:26.645 --> 11:29.523
Uh, I'm David, I live here.

11:30.983 --> 11:33.944
Think you have the wrong house, dear.

11:34.570 --> 11:38.323
- Where's my mom?
- I have no idea.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.409
Oh, are you lost?

11:40.450 --> 11:44.913
Hey! Where do you think you're going?

11:44.955 --> 11:48.208
Now, just a minute,
You've made a mistake!

11:48.250 --> 11:50.210
Mom? Dad?

11:52.171 --> 11:54.047
Oh!

11:56.008 --> 11:57.718
Mom!

11:58.719 --> 12:00.012
Larry!

12:07.311 --> 12:09.688
What's the problem, son?

12:13.150 --> 12:15.027
Now, calm down, son!

12:17.237 --> 12:19.990
Now, nobody is going to hurt you.

12:20.490 --> 12:23.243
What's your name?
Where do you live?

12:26.455 --> 12:28.916
<i>Please...</i>

12:28.957 --> 12:32.044
Where's my mom and dad?

12:33.295 --> 12:35.714
Janet, call the police.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.676
And because of that,
everything's chaos here,

12:39.718 --> 12:42.221
You're gonna have to process this,

12:55.192 --> 12:57.361
<i>Authorities
are investigating what has caused</i>

12:57.402 --> 12:59.571
<i>power blackouts in sections of two
counties.</i>

12:59.613 --> 13:03.659
<i>Emergency generators are in operation
at Lauderdale General Hospital.</i>

13:03.700 --> 13:05.160
Not hungry, huh?

13:05.202 --> 13:07.496
<i>The electricity should be reinstated...</i>

13:07.538 --> 13:09.206
Is my dad coming yet?

13:09.206 --> 13:14.169
Phil? We ran his name,
and the computer came up with this,

13:14.211 --> 13:16.004
Oh, good, A missing person report,

13:16.046 --> 13:20.342
"David Scott Freeman,
Hair: brown, Eyes: brown,"

13:20.384 --> 13:24.388
"Last seen wearing blue polo shirt
with white stripes,

13:24.388 --> 13:28.350
blue jeans and white sneakers,
carrying a blue knapsack."

13:30.435 --> 13:33.522
- Have we located the parents?
- Yes, but Phil, look at the date.

13:33.564 --> 13:35.774
What about it?
Must be a typo.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.735
I ran it through the computer
three times. That's no mistake.

13:38.777 --> 13:42.406
- He was declared legally dead.
- Who's dead?

13:42.990 --> 13:46.952
No one's dead, David. Come on,
Let's start putting this puzzle together.

13:50.831 --> 13:55.210
Now, David, just a few more questions
for our paperwork, OK?

13:55.252 --> 13:59.089
- How old are you?
- I already told you, Twelve.

13:59.131 --> 14:01.633
All right, And what is the date today?

14:01.675 --> 14:04.761
It's the fourth of July.

14:04.803 --> 14:07.848
- What year?
- 1978.

14:12.728 --> 14:16.315
Uh, David, who's the President
of the United States?

14:16.356 --> 14:20.194
Duh, You wanna know that
for your paperwork?

14:20.235 --> 14:22.362
Mm-hm.

14:22.404 --> 14:24.448
Well?

14:24.489 --> 14:26.950
It's Jimmy Carter,

14:40.964 --> 14:44.092
- Why are we stopping?
- You'll see.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.846
Be right back.

14:52.726 --> 14:56.230
<i>- Who lives here?
- We're not sure yet.</i>

15:06.823 --> 15:09.201
<i>Quiet! Calm down.</i>

15:10.494 --> 15:14.081
Look, I'm sorry to disturb you folks,
but are you the same William Freeman

15:14.122 --> 15:17.626
who reported missing a son,
David Scott Freeman,

15:17.668 --> 15:20.128
on July 4, 1978?

15:20.170 --> 15:21.880
Yes.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.591
<i>- Dad!
- David...</i>

15:24.633 --> 15:27.177
David, wait a second!

15:27.219 --> 15:31.431
<i>Well, I'm Detective Banks,
Juvenile Division, It seems that we...</i>

15:32.516 --> 15:33.976
<i>David...</i>

15:39.356 --> 15:42.234
Oh, my God!

15:45.070 --> 15:47.447
- Oh!
- Thank God!

16:07.551 --> 16:10.512
- Dr, Faraday,
- Any signs of life?

16:10.554 --> 16:14.600
Not outside, But we haven't been
able to determine what's inside.

16:14.641 --> 16:18.687
Well, something must have flown it,
This could be our first contact.

16:18.729 --> 16:20.189
She's beautiful.

16:20.230 --> 16:23.275
Sir, this is the night watchman
who found it, Ellis Brayton.

16:23.317 --> 16:26.361
Says he hasn't told anyone
except the local authorities,

16:26.403 --> 16:28.780
so what we have here is a controlled
situation.

16:28.822 --> 16:31.575
Watch your step, Mr, Brayton.

16:31.617 --> 16:32.868
- Hi.
- Hi.

16:32.910 --> 16:37.539
- I'm Lewis Faraday, NASA,
- Sure is a pretty piece of spacelab.

16:38.081 --> 16:40.792
It was flying along, then it
just smacked right into the tower

16:40.834 --> 16:46.882
and dragged it about 100 yards,
Then it stopped and it's floating here,

16:47.925 --> 16:52.054
Say, I don't suppose you gentlemen
could tell me how you do that?

16:52.095 --> 16:56.141
No, Mr, Brayton,
it's a matter of national security,

16:57.267 --> 17:01.688
- Any idea how we're gonna move it?
- Are you kidding? Watch this.

17:01.730 --> 17:04.107
<i>- Uh, no...</i>

17:15.618 --> 17:18.539
Who are you? What's happening?

17:18.579 --> 17:20.707
- Just rest, David,
- I don't wanna rest!

17:20.749 --> 17:24.294
- Where's my mom and dad?
- We're right here, sweetheart.

17:24.336 --> 17:26.755
What's happening, Mom? I'm scared!

17:26.797 --> 17:30.801
Don't be scared, honey,
We won't let anybody hurt you.

17:32.469 --> 17:35.264
What happened to you, Mom?

17:35.305 --> 17:37.599
You too, Dad?

17:37.641 --> 17:40.602
Why were those people in our house?
Why?

17:40.644 --> 17:43.897
David, we don't know
all the answers to all this yet.

17:43.939 --> 17:47.150
but the main thing is you're alive,

17:53.323 --> 17:55.450
David, where have you been all this time?

17:55.492 --> 17:57.286
All this time?

17:57.327 --> 18:00.789
I just went to get Jeff
at the Johnsons' a few hours ago.

18:00.831 --> 18:03.208
Get Jeff, He'll tell you!

18:03.250 --> 18:05.252
David?

18:09.506 --> 18:11.675
Who's that?

18:13.302 --> 18:16.263
That's your brother, Jeffrey.

18:16.305 --> 18:17.764
What?

18:17.764 --> 18:20.475
Mr, and Mrs, Freeman?

18:20.517 --> 18:22.853
Could I see you outside
for a few minutes, please?

18:22.895 --> 18:24.897
<i>Sure.</i>

18:27.524 --> 18:29.443
Honey?

18:33.197 --> 18:35.407
We'll be right back.

18:43.999 --> 18:46.793
You look just like I remember you,

18:50.797 --> 18:55.511
This is totally rad,
I mean, you're my big little brother.

18:57.387 --> 19:00.057
You're not my brother.

19:00.098 --> 19:04.686
<i>Listen...I'm sorry for scaring you like that,</i>

19:04.728 --> 19:06.688
jumping out of the tree,

19:07.439 --> 19:09.816
I felt rotten about it.

19:09.858 --> 19:12.194
Anybody could know that.

19:12.236 --> 19:15.531
Hey, you think it's easy for me
to believe that you're David?

19:15.572 --> 19:18.909
I mean, you should be,
like, 20 years old now.

19:26.416 --> 19:28.210
I'm not really sure why I kept this,

19:28.252 --> 19:32.798
I guess I thought
maybe I'd be able to use it.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.925
You know, kind of save the day.

19:37.594 --> 19:41.348
Mom and Dad went nuts
when we couldn't find you.

19:41.390 --> 19:47.521
They made me put those things up
on every telephone pole and tree for years,

19:47.521 --> 19:49.398
Every Saturday.

19:51.775 --> 19:56.530
You should've seen Mom,
She kept all the stuff in your room.

19:57.656 --> 20:00.576
She refused to believe
that you were dead.

20:04.705 --> 20:09.293
It's 1986, man,
Eight years since that night.

20:13.463 --> 20:15.340
You little weasel,

20:18.010 --> 20:20.387
Dork.

20:20.429 --> 20:23.015
Butt-face.

20:23.056 --> 20:25.559
<i>- Scuzz-bucket...</i>

20:26.435 --> 20:31.106
<i>Jeff...I'm scared.</i>

20:32.274 --> 20:34.693
We'll figure something out.

20:36.737 --> 20:41.033
- Dad, I wanna go home,
- Yeah, I know, I know, David, We want you

20:41.074 --> 20:43.660
to come home too but the doctor wants you
to stay in the hospital a couple of days.

20:43.702 --> 20:46.246
No, Dad! Please don't make me stay.

20:46.288 --> 20:48.707
We have to find out where you've been.

20:48.749 --> 20:52.169
He wants to run a couple of tests
to help you remember,

20:52.211 --> 20:55.547
and we thought that was important,
Davey, so we said OK.

20:55.589 --> 20:57.716
Mom!

20:57.758 --> 21:02.221
Oh, honey, one of us
will be with you around the clock.

21:03.764 --> 21:07.309
Nothing bad's gonna happen to you,
I promise,

21:08.352 --> 21:12.272
Now, um, you two guys,
you go get some sleep.

21:13.190 --> 21:15.234
I'll stay with our guy tonight.

21:24.618 --> 21:28.413
OK, right,
Well, we'll see you in a couple of hours.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.332
Bye.

21:30.374 --> 21:32.584
Be cool, dude.

21:34.878 --> 21:40.008
<i>Mom...have I really
been gone eight years?</i>

21:40.342 --> 21:42.261
Yeah.

21:43.178 --> 21:45.597
It's like a bad dream.

22:55.626 --> 23:00.923
<i>Thyroid hormones suggest that a great
many factors could influence one of...</i>

23:00.964 --> 23:04.009
He's hurt! He's calling me.

23:04.885 --> 23:07.471
What is it?

23:10.557 --> 23:13.352
- Nothing, Forget it,
- No! What?

23:14.269 --> 23:18.815
Well, this voice keeps calling,

23:18.857 --> 23:22.361
saying something over and over and over.

23:22.402 --> 23:24.821
But I can't understand very much.

23:25.656 --> 23:28.367
Well, what is it saying?

23:28.408 --> 23:30.410
<i>Something...</i>

23:34.206 --> 23:36.333
I can't explain it.

23:40.254 --> 23:42.840
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

23:42.881 --> 23:45.259
No, I believe you.

23:50.514 --> 23:53.517
You don't think I'm going crazy, do you?

23:54.434 --> 23:58.105
Are you kidding?
They've run a million tests on you.

23:58.146 --> 24:03.235
In fact, you're probably
the only sane person in this place,

24:03.277 --> 24:06.947
Don't worry about it,
It was just a bad dream.

24:08.907 --> 24:10.951
Thanks.

24:35.559 --> 24:40.564
- Have you tried everything?
- Everything. It's completely impregnable.

24:40.564 --> 24:43.275
We must get inside.

24:43.317 --> 24:49.489
For all we know, something may be
living, or perhaps even dying inside this.

24:49.531 --> 24:53.285
It appears to be seamless -
no way in, no way out,

25:03.253 --> 25:09.301
- David, what time did you enter the
woods? - Around 8:00.

25:09.301 --> 25:11.887
Then you met your brother?

25:11.929 --> 25:15.265
Yeah, The jerk jumped out
of a tree and scared me,

25:15.307 --> 25:17.601
<i>He's lucky he's still alive.</i>

25:18.268 --> 25:20.229
Then what happened?

25:20.270 --> 25:24.483
<i>Well...I chased him for a while,</i>

25:27.861 --> 25:30.405
Then I reached this cliff.

25:30.447 --> 25:35.577
Jesus! He's transmitting in alpha waves
with complex frequency patterns in them.

25:35.619 --> 25:37.621
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

25:37.663 --> 25:40.749
I know I fell,

25:40.791 --> 25:44.253
The alpha waves are coming in
at 12,78 cycles per second.

25:44.253 --> 25:47.714
He's communicating directly
with the computer in binary code,

25:47.714 --> 25:51.718
- How the hell is he doing that?
- I have no idea.

25:51.760 --> 25:56.056
But then after you fell,
you went somewhere,

25:56.098 --> 25:58.016
How did you get there?

26:01.061 --> 26:03.146
<i>What is that?</i>

26:03.188 --> 26:07.442
- Is that coming from David?
- I believe it is.

26:11.572 --> 26:13.365
<i>Well, what is it?</i>

26:13.866 --> 26:16.827
How did I get out of the ravine?

26:17.703 --> 26:20.164
I crawled out.

26:38.182 --> 26:43.437
<i>Let's get the gas jets now,
CO2 sensors with the breakers...</i>

26:43.478 --> 26:47.191
Dr, Faraday, I think you
should take a look at this.

26:48.859 --> 26:53.614
- Where did this come from?
- From the mind of 12-year-old boy.

27:00.996 --> 27:03.540
David, what do you think?

27:03.582 --> 27:06.084
No way! I'm not going.

27:07.294 --> 27:11.048
I don't think you understand
the importance of this situation.

27:11.089 --> 27:15.969
I don't care if it's a matter of national
security, If David says no, then that's it.

27:16.011 --> 27:20.516
But David would get treatment
from the best specialists in the country,

27:20.557 --> 27:25.145
not to mention technical capabilities
this hospital is not prepared to offer.

27:25.187 --> 27:26.813
- Am I correct, Doctor?
- It's true.

27:26.855 --> 27:28.440
<i>We've done just about
everything we can for him...</i>

27:28.440 --> 27:32.819
Excuse me, I know that all sounds great,
but the fact is David has to go on living,

27:32.861 --> 27:35.155
and he can't do that in an institution.

27:35.197 --> 27:38.325
So until you can tell me something
that makes one ounce of sense,

27:38.325 --> 27:41.161
then we're all going home,
and that's all there is to it.

27:41.203 --> 27:42.704
- Right on, Dad.
- Yeah.

27:43.914 --> 27:47.292
Well, I'm sorry you don't
wanna know the truth.

27:48.460 --> 27:49.419
What?

27:49.419 --> 27:52.631
The truth about where David's been
for the last eight years.

27:52.673 --> 27:58.387
Why he can't remember, What all
this unusual brain activity means.

27:58.428 --> 28:03.058
<i>And most of all...why he hasn't aged.</i>

28:09.606 --> 28:13.360
David, I can offer you the truth,

28:13.402 --> 28:15.654
All I need is 48 hours.

28:15.696 --> 28:22.035
Just two days at the base
with me and my staff, alone.

28:22.077 --> 28:25.122
No confusion, no distraction,

28:25.164 --> 28:30.460
And then, David, you can go home
and put all this behind you.

28:31.628 --> 28:34.089
That's what you want, isn't it?

28:41.972 --> 28:43.432
Yes.

29:02.659 --> 29:05.746
- Who said that?
- Who said what?

29:06.497 --> 29:08.582
Never mind.

29:24.473 --> 29:29.853
Well, David, this will be your
room for a while, What do you think?

29:32.648 --> 29:35.609
- Is this stuff for me?
- Yes, it is.

29:35.651 --> 29:39.196
There's no phone in here, I thought I was
supposed to be able to call my parents.

29:39.238 --> 29:42.616
We'll make that call together
first thing tomorrow from my office, OK?

29:42.658 --> 29:47.913
Now, look, if you wanna watch TV,
this is a remote-control wand.

29:47.955 --> 29:50.374
And we'll get you something
to eat right away, OK?

29:50.415 --> 29:53.418
Now, here's a special gift just for you.

29:55.128 --> 29:57.297
Tomorrow's gonna be very exciting.

29:57.339 --> 30:01.844
So you enjoy yourself
and we'll see you in the morning.

30:05.889 --> 30:07.474
Hey!

30:07.516 --> 30:11.311
<i>...Americans out there
who need and want to lose weight.</i>

30:11.353 --> 30:15.107
<i>Let's constrain ourselves.
Let's get back to the basic subject.</i>

30:15.148 --> 30:18.110
<i>What can your diet do for Americans?</i>

30:25.576 --> 30:27.411
<i>Pardon me. Coming through.</i>

30:29.955 --> 30:32.040
Get away!

30:34.209 --> 30:37.462
Hi, I'm Carolyn McAdams.

30:37.504 --> 30:40.340
You gotta be real hungry
after your trip, right?

30:40.382 --> 30:43.468
- What is this thing?
- That's RALF.

30:43.510 --> 30:45.596
- RALF?
- Mm-hm.

30:46.138 --> 30:49.683
Robotic Assistant Labor Facilitator.

30:50.392 --> 30:53.103
Actually what he does here
is he delivers mail and supplies,

30:53.145 --> 30:57.024
and he messes up a little bit
every now and then.

30:57.941 --> 31:02.863
<i>So...who did you murder
to get put here in maximum security?</i>

31:02.905 --> 31:05.824
No one, I'm a national security secret.

31:05.866 --> 31:11.163
Oh, Well, in that case,
I shouldn't be talking to you at all.

31:11.205 --> 31:16.293
<i>Wait a sec! Um, how come
Starsky and Hutch isn't on?</i>

31:16.293 --> 31:18.754
That show was canceled
a long time ago.

31:18.795 --> 31:22.508
That was my favorite show!
And what's this stuff?

31:25.761 --> 31:29.348
You've never seen a music video before?

31:29.389 --> 31:32.976
Uh-uh, I've been gone for eight years.

31:33.018 --> 31:35.145
Gone where? Outer space?

31:37.981 --> 31:42.361
- Could be,
- You know something? You're a weird kid.

31:42.402 --> 31:46.281
Me? I'm not the one with the purple hair.

31:48.909 --> 31:53.580
Oh, yeah, I went to a concert
with some friends last night,

31:53.622 --> 31:58.252
Really? My mom took me to see
the Bee Gees a couple months ago.

31:58.293 --> 32:01.380
- Who'd you see?
- Twisted Sister.

32:01.421 --> 32:04.424
- Never heard of her.
- It's a him.

32:05.467 --> 32:08.762
- Oh.
- Actually, it's a them.

32:11.890 --> 32:15.310
You're serious about being away,
aren't you?

32:16.019 --> 32:18.772
What was it?
Like a coma or something?

32:19.356 --> 32:21.316
I can't remember.

32:22.025 --> 32:25.154
All right, listen. Um, I gotta go.

32:25.779 --> 32:28.699
Um, is there anything else you want
when I come back?

32:28.740 --> 32:31.285
How about a Big Mac,
large fries and a Coke?

32:31.326 --> 32:34.538
- They're still around, I hope.
- Well, now, that all depends. Do you want

32:34.580 --> 32:38.375
New Coke, Classic Coke, Cherry Coke,
Diet Coke or caffeine-free Coke?

32:38.417 --> 32:41.295
- Huh?
- Nothing. Forget it.

32:42.087 --> 32:44.882
If they're still around,
then I'll do my best, all right?

32:44.923 --> 32:46.550
- OK, Bye.
- See ya.

32:46.550 --> 32:50.888
Well, come on, RALF.
Come on, Ralfie baby.

32:50.929 --> 32:53.265
You'll make it. Come on,

33:07.905 --> 33:10.240
All right! Way to go.

33:12.826 --> 33:15.746
Jeff! David's on the phone!

33:16.413 --> 33:20.501
They gave me a NASA cap, and
there are robots here they call RALF.

33:20.542 --> 33:24.171
And there's a nice lady
that brings me my food.

33:24.213 --> 33:28.008
Oh, and another thing,
They locked me in my room.

33:28.008 --> 33:31.762
Uh, the locks are there
for David's protection.

33:31.803 --> 33:33.180
Don't take any shit, David.

33:33.180 --> 33:37.643
Now, don't forget your promise, Doctor,
David has to be back in 48 hours.

33:37.643 --> 33:39.978
<i>Don't worry, Mrs. Freeman.</i>

33:40.020 --> 33:42.314
Hi, David, it's Dad again.

33:45.192 --> 33:46.276
Hi, Dad.

33:46.276 --> 33:51.949
We're just here fixing up your room,
waiting for you for when you get back.

33:51.990 --> 33:53.367
And we'll see you soon.

33:53.408 --> 33:56.036
That's great. Thanks.

33:56.036 --> 33:58.622
We sure do miss you, son.

33:58.622 --> 34:01.500
I miss you, too, Dad.

34:01.542 --> 34:05.128
<i>I miss all you guys...a whole lot.</i>

34:05.170 --> 34:06.463
<i>Bye.</i>

34:06.463 --> 34:07.965
Bye. Bye-bye.

34:07.965 --> 34:10.050
Bye, David.

34:26.065 --> 34:30.320
OK, now, David, if you can,

34:30.362 --> 34:35.117
I'd like you to try and remember what
happened when you fell in the ravine.

34:35.784 --> 34:42.708
<i>Well, I tried to stop myself, but the...</i>

34:45.585 --> 34:48.964
OK, everybody, remain calm,
Try to bring it back up to speed,

34:49.005 --> 34:52.342
- What's going on?
- It's all right, David. Everything's fine.

34:55.304 --> 34:56.804
- We're ready, sir.
- OK.

34:56.847 --> 34:59.766
Bring the computers up
to synchronization slowly.

34:59.808 --> 35:02.686
Let's see if we can latch the data
at a higher rate.

35:06.356 --> 35:08.483
Well, what is your name?

35:09.943 --> 35:11.320
<i>We're in sync.</i>

35:11.361 --> 35:15.407
Wait a sec! How'd that happen?
I didn't say a thing!

35:15.449 --> 35:16.825
Next question.

35:16.825 --> 35:20.454
David, where have you been
for the last eight years?

35:20.496 --> 35:23.248
I've already told you, I don't know.

35:30.047 --> 35:33.842
What powered the craft
that you were traveling in?

35:44.811 --> 35:49.024
Oh, my God. This kid's head is full.

35:49.024 --> 35:51.527
What language is that?

35:51.568 --> 35:54.822
- Oh, who knows what's in this boy's head?
- What are you talking about?

35:54.863 --> 35:59.201
- We can spend years trying to decipher it,
- Who's putting that stuff on the screen?

36:00.410 --> 36:02.496
You are, David.

36:02.538 --> 36:04.832
But that's impossible.

36:06.625 --> 36:12.256
- How far is it from Earth to Phaelon?
- I've never heard of the place,

36:13.257 --> 36:16.343
How long did it take you to get there?

36:18.387 --> 36:21.765
- Light-speed theory.
- That's the only possible explanation,

36:21.807 --> 36:24.059
Well, what's that?

36:25.310 --> 36:29.481
David, if you were traveling
beyond the speed of light,

36:29.523 --> 36:32.651
then you could've been
gone only 4.4 hours,

36:32.693 --> 36:37.072
and the rest of us here on Earth
would've aged eight years.

36:37.114 --> 36:38.532
Well, what does that mean?

36:38.574 --> 36:42.870
Time slows down
as you approach the speed of light.

36:42.911 --> 36:47.207
<i>- Speed of light?
- David...where is Phaelon?</i>

36:47.249 --> 36:50.127
How am I supposed to know?

36:52.754 --> 36:55.841
He's searching through star charts!

37:06.268 --> 37:09.980
<i>- Sir, I think he's downloading,
- Wait...</i>

37:10.022 --> 37:12.941
<i>My God,
These are uncharted systems.</i>

37:12.983 --> 37:16.278
<i>Our computers
don't contain this information.</i>

37:31.877 --> 37:34.546
- David, is this Phaelon?
- I don't know!

37:37.216 --> 37:39.384
Let me out of here!

37:39.426 --> 37:41.553
David! David!

37:44.598 --> 37:47.601
48 hours is not gonna be enough time.

37:57.653 --> 38:00.572
<i>Pardon me. Coming through.</i>

38:01.114 --> 38:02.741
Hi, there.

38:03.867 --> 38:06.578
Hi, Carolyn.

38:07.704 --> 38:10.290
So, how's the testing going?

38:10.666 --> 38:14.127
Terrible. But at least
I get to go home tomorrow.

38:14.169 --> 38:17.589
They told you that
you're going home tomorrow?

38:17.631 --> 38:19.758
That's right. Why?

38:22.052 --> 38:25.138
<i>- Nothing.
- Carolyn...</i>

38:26.473 --> 38:30.185
It's just I've seen the meal sheet for the
coming week and they've got you on it.

38:30.227 --> 38:32.729
- Until when?
- All week.

38:32.771 --> 38:35.190
But that's impossible!

38:35.232 --> 38:38.861
They promised it would
only be 48 hours!

38:38.902 --> 38:43.323
You guys hear me in there?
I want out of here right now!

38:43.365 --> 38:46.869
You think I don't watch television?
Wake up!

38:46.910 --> 38:50.205
Hey, Now, come on,
it's not as bad as it seems.

38:50.247 --> 38:53.625
How would you know? You've never
been locked away from your family

38:53.667 --> 38:55.794
and been put in some awful place you
hate!

38:55.836 --> 39:01.758
Yes, every time my father got new orders,
I had to go and I had to start all over again.

39:05.053 --> 39:07.055
Maybe you're right.

39:07.097 --> 39:09.933
<i>Carolyn,
I've got to get outta here.</i>

39:09.975 --> 39:12.519
<i>- David...
- Contact my parents.</i>

39:12.561 --> 39:15.898
Tell them what's going on.
They're in Information.

39:15.939 --> 39:19.485
- Hey, what's he doing?
- Go see them for me.

39:19.693 --> 39:21.403
Please.

39:25.157 --> 39:28.285
Well, I gotta get back to work, OK?

39:34.750 --> 39:36.710
<i>You know...</i>

39:37.252 --> 39:39.671
you're cute.

39:41.965 --> 39:44.343
Did a girl ever tell you that before?

39:45.052 --> 39:49.097
Nobody but my mom,
But I don't think she counts.

40:09.034 --> 40:11.245
<i>Yes.</i>

40:11.286 --> 40:13.330
I'm here.

40:14.289 --> 40:16.542
<i>Help me.</i>

40:17.209 --> 40:20.504
Help you? How?

40:22.005 --> 40:24.675
<i>Are you coming?</i>

40:25.092 --> 40:27.302
Yes, I'm coming.

40:30.013 --> 40:32.850
<i>Pardon me. Coming through.</i>

40:32.891 --> 40:36.520
<i>Get in the RALF unit.</i>

41:05.090 --> 41:09.136
<i>Full house, Got you again.</i>

41:10.387 --> 41:12.431
I can't believe this.

41:34.912 --> 41:37.998
Hey, come on.
We'll get you your own breakfast,

46:21.323 --> 46:22.825
Agh!

46:33.961 --> 46:38.173
- Who's that?
- Sit down, Navigator.

46:38.215 --> 46:42.928
- Are you the one that's been calling me?
- Affirmative.

46:42.970 --> 46:47.641
You have the information I require
to complete my mission.

46:49.059 --> 46:51.645
Sit down!

46:51.687 --> 46:53.689
I think there's been
some sort of mistake.

46:53.730 --> 46:58.026
I do not make mistakes.
Awaiting final vectors.

46:58.026 --> 47:02.281
Vectors? I don't have any vectors,
I'm just a kid.

47:02.322 --> 47:04.199
That is obvious.

47:04.241 --> 47:08.120
But your brain has been programmed
with all appropriate star charts.

47:08.162 --> 47:11.999
You mean, that's why my brain has been
coming up with all that stuff?

47:12.040 --> 47:13.876
Yes.

47:13.917 --> 47:17.379
You are the Navigator!

47:26.346 --> 47:27.806
<i>Holy...</i>

47:27.848 --> 47:29.224
Campbell!

47:30.851 --> 47:32.728
Oh, my God.

47:32.769 --> 47:35.397
Seal all doors,
Activate penetration recording.

47:35.439 --> 47:38.567
Activate all radiation surveillance
consoles 1 through 20.

47:38.609 --> 47:41.820
Switch control monitors to automatic.

47:53.207 --> 47:56.376
Dr, Faraday, somebody
has penetrated security, sir.

47:56.418 --> 47:58.128
<i>- They're in the hangar now?
- Yes, sir...</i>

47:58.170 --> 48:00.547
<i>- When did this happen?
- We don't know yet, We're trying to get...</i>

48:18.398 --> 48:20.901
- Can you tell what it is?
- No, I can't see a thing.

48:20.943 --> 48:23.403
- Do you have radiation?
- Negative, We show a cold room.

48:23.445 --> 48:26.698
All right,
Get the goddamn door open. Now!

48:27.699 --> 48:31.870
We still have containment. I want security
doubled immediately. You got that?

48:31.912 --> 48:35.082
Navigator, I detect alien life forms
approaching.

48:35.123 --> 48:38.335
- Aliens? Where?
- Observe.

48:42.840 --> 48:46.009
Those aren't aliens.
They're human beings.

48:51.682 --> 48:55.269
Uh-oh, I'm gonna get it for this.

48:57.521 --> 49:01.316
- Holy shit, it's an alien.
- No, you idiot. It's the kid.

49:01.358 --> 49:03.569
- David?
- Oh, great.

49:10.159 --> 49:14.163
- They've got guns.
- Protective hover is advised.

49:14.204 --> 49:16.623
- Will that shut the door?
- Affirmative.

49:16.665 --> 49:20.711
OK, let's do that. But if anybody asks,
you're the one that did it, OK?

49:20.752 --> 49:23.088
Compliance.

49:23.130 --> 49:26.133
Now, just get out of the ship, son.

49:56.413 --> 49:58.790
Request initial maneuvers.

49:58.832 --> 50:01.919
I don't have any maneuvers,
I just wanna get out of here.

50:01.960 --> 50:04.505
You wish to depart
hostile alien environment?

50:04.546 --> 50:06.215
- Yes!
- Compliance.

51:14.616 --> 51:17.286
Wow! Did you do that?

51:17.327 --> 51:19.955
Elementary maneuver. I must complete
my mission and return to Phaelon.

51:19.997 --> 51:22.624
But I don't wanna go to Phaelon,
I wanna go home.

51:22.666 --> 51:25.878
Navigator, I'm awaiting your command,
We must act now...

51:25.919 --> 51:29.131
Look, I gotta think.
Just take us 20 miles from here.

51:29.173 --> 51:30.132
Compliance.

51:33.010 --> 51:35.512
What are you doing?

51:39.183 --> 51:41.351
Let's get over to tracking!

51:42.686 --> 51:44.104
Stop!

51:46.315 --> 51:47.858
<i>Agh!</i>

51:47.858 --> 51:49.735
Ohh!

51:50.694 --> 51:54.448
- You requested this distance.
- I didn't mean straight up!

51:54.490 --> 51:57.743
- I meant along the ground.
- Oh.

52:00.787 --> 52:04.291
<i>Sir, it just shot straight up
at over mach ten...</i>

52:04.875 --> 52:07.461
and stopped 20 miles up.

52:08.754 --> 52:11.673
- Take me back!
- Compliance.

52:16.136 --> 52:17.721
Oh, no!

52:18.263 --> 52:20.557
<i>It's heading back.</i>

52:30.692 --> 52:31.693
There he is.

52:35.739 --> 52:37.699
Wow! How did you do that?

52:37.741 --> 52:40.369
That was a third-class maneuver,
Navigator.

52:40.410 --> 52:44.456
Well, if that was a third-class maneuver,
what's a first-class?

52:44.498 --> 52:45.541
Observe.

53:00.138 --> 53:01.890
Uh-oh.

53:10.941 --> 53:15.362
This first-class maneuver lets me to slide
through your planet's thick atmosphere.

53:15.404 --> 53:18.532
I can move at any speed,
I can speak thousands of languages,

53:18.574 --> 53:21.785
I can analyze species from civilizations
light years beyond yours.

53:21.827 --> 53:24.496
- Yeah, but can you fix this seat?
- Compliance.

53:25.122 --> 53:26.999
That's great.

53:27.040 --> 53:31.086
- Now could you slow down a little?
- Compliance.

53:32.045 --> 53:33.338
Cool.

53:33.338 --> 53:35.507
Would you like me
to adjust the temperature?

53:35.507 --> 53:37.050
No.

53:47.102 --> 53:50.022
We are precisely 20 miles from
point of origin, as you requested.

53:50.063 --> 53:52.608
You are wasting time.
Give me the star charts now.

53:52.649 --> 53:54.276
Not now, I gotta go,

53:54.318 --> 53:56.528
- Go? Where?
- To the bathroom.

53:56.570 --> 54:00.157
- Do not know "bathroom".
- Then open the door.

54:00.199 --> 54:02.451
Request explanation.

54:02.826 --> 54:06.914
Just do it or you'll be sorry.
I'll be right back. I promise.

54:06.955 --> 54:08.957
Do not know "promise".

54:10.792 --> 54:14.129
Damn! How did that kid get outside?

54:14.129 --> 54:19.510
We had security everywhere.
Gotta get control of the situation.

54:19.551 --> 54:21.428
Sir, over here.

54:22.763 --> 54:25.766
There they are.
About 20 miles west of here.

54:25.766 --> 54:27.768
Get some choppers out there immediately.

54:34.900 --> 54:37.361
What are you doing?

54:37.402 --> 54:41.698
- Can't I have a little privacy?
- Do not know "privacy".

54:48.831 --> 54:50.791
What are you doing here anyway?

54:50.833 --> 54:53.752
I have been sent from Phaelon
to borrow samples of life

54:53.794 --> 54:55.796
from different galaxies for study.

54:55.838 --> 54:58.382
On this planet, I chose you.

54:59.550 --> 55:02.177
- Why me?
- Why not?

55:04.805 --> 55:08.684
Back on Phaelon, we discovered
that your inferior species

55:08.725 --> 55:10.978
uses only ten percent of your brain.

55:11.019 --> 55:13.730
So we filled it all the way up with star
charts to see what would happen.

55:13.772 --> 55:16.692
- What happened?
- It leaked.

55:16.733 --> 55:19.319
<i>- Navigator...
- I am not a navigator!</i>

55:19.695 --> 55:21.238
Yes, you are.

55:21.238 --> 55:24.908
I crashed into electrical towers
and my star charts were erased.

55:24.950 --> 55:28.871
I need the ones in your head
to complete my mission.

55:28.912 --> 55:32.624
So you need me and my inferior brain
to fly that thing?

55:32.666 --> 55:38.630
Correction, I need the superior information
in your inferior brain to fly this thing.

55:39.923 --> 55:45.846
Well, if I'm so inferior, how come
you took eight years to bring me back?

55:45.888 --> 55:47.890
Normally, I take my specimens
back in time

55:47.931 --> 55:50.893
to the exact moment
and place I collected them.

55:50.934 --> 55:54.813
Come on!
You took me away from my family!

55:54.855 --> 55:58.025
And when you returned me,
it was eight years later!

55:58.025 --> 56:01.153
Everything's changed, except me!

56:01.195 --> 56:04.448
Unfortunately, we discovered
it was too dangerous

56:04.490 --> 56:07.576
for your fragile human body
to travel back in time.

56:07.618 --> 56:13.248
OK, if I can't go back in time,
at least take me back to my family,

56:15.626 --> 56:17.211
Come aboard quickly, Navigator.

56:17.252 --> 56:20.005
Not until you promise to take me home!

56:20.047 --> 56:22.966
We've spotted 'em.
The boy's outside the ship.

56:23.008 --> 56:25.844
<i>Can you keep them
on the ground?</i>

56:25.886 --> 56:29.473
Very well. You give me the star chart
and I'll take you home.

56:30.766 --> 56:32.976
Come on, Let's get outta here.

56:34.853 --> 56:39.107
<i>- He's gone back into the ship.
- Don't let them take off!</i>

56:39.149 --> 56:41.735
- Request instructions.
- I don't know,

56:41.777 --> 56:46.198
<i>- Just...just get us out of here!
- Compliance.</i>

56:55.457 --> 56:58.001
My God, it changed shape!

57:00.963 --> 57:02.422
Can you follow it?

57:02.464 --> 57:06.260
Follow it? I can't even see it.

57:11.348 --> 57:14.643
- Hey, this is fun.
- Fun, Navigator?

57:14.685 --> 57:17.771
- My name's David.
- David?

57:18.397 --> 57:20.566
Yeah, So what do I call you, anyway?

57:20.607 --> 57:23.694
<i>- I am a trimaxion drone ship from...
- Trimaxion?</i>

57:23.735 --> 57:26.780
- Affirmative.
- OK, I'll call you Max. It's easier.

57:26.822 --> 57:29.950
- Max?
- Right.

57:41.837 --> 57:44.298
Just take me somewhere
where they can't find us.

57:44.339 --> 57:46.925
Compliance.

57:50.220 --> 57:52.389
What are you doing?

57:52.431 --> 57:53.932
Agh!

57:57.102 --> 57:59.188
I didn't say take us under the ocean.

57:59.229 --> 58:02.733
All I asked for was a place
they couldn't find us.

58:02.774 --> 58:06.236
This was the first place
suggested by my data banks.

58:06.487 --> 58:09.823
- Will this thing leak?
- Navigator, I do not leak,

58:09.865 --> 58:11.950
you leak, remember?

58:12.784 --> 58:13.827
Hm.

58:13.869 --> 58:18.373
I must program my circuitry
for the mind transfer.

58:20.250 --> 58:24.755
<i>- Wow! What are these?</i>

58:24.796 --> 58:28.759
Those are the other specimens
we studied on Phaelon.

58:28.800 --> 58:31.136
- Where do they come from?
- Don't touch!

58:31.178 --> 58:33.430
That is a Garpuntle
from South Petrawlis.

58:33.472 --> 58:35.891
Once he bites, he never lets go.

58:35.933 --> 58:37.226
What's this?

58:37.267 --> 58:41.480
That is a Feenastarus
from the Pixar Elliptic.

58:41.897 --> 58:45.567
Weird. What are they doing here?

58:45.609 --> 58:48.904
After I drop you off, I will travel back in time

58:48.946 --> 58:53.534
and take them to their homes,
just as if they never left.

58:56.453 --> 59:00.916
- What's that?
- A very unpleasant little creature.

59:00.958 --> 59:03.544
- What's his problem?
- He's got a cold.

59:04.044 --> 59:06.672
Ew, gross.

59:11.176 --> 59:14.221
Don't get too close, David.
They're hungry,

59:20.394 --> 59:22.813
That could've been your head, David.

59:35.075 --> 59:36.410
What's in here?

59:36.451 --> 59:40.622
Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai-ai!

59:46.378 --> 59:48.088
What's this one?

59:48.088 --> 59:50.841
That is a Puckmarin
from Binpuka Minor.

59:50.841 --> 59:52.634
He's not dangerous.

01:00:02.436 --> 01:00:07.274
- Can I hold him?
- Just keep him quiet, I'm concentrating.

01:00:10.652 --> 01:00:14.364
Hey, little Puckmarin,
how long have you been here?

01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:17.993
What's he saying?

01:00:18.035 --> 01:00:21.538
He is angry because I won't take him
back to his home planet.

01:00:21.580 --> 01:00:24.958
He does not know
it was destroyed by a comet.

01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:28.962
That makes him an orphan.

01:00:31.882 --> 01:00:35.928
I wish I could take you home with me.
Jeff would really flip out.

01:00:40.224 --> 01:00:42.226
Listen. He's laughing.

01:00:42.267 --> 01:00:45.521
What is the purpose of laughing?

01:00:45.562 --> 01:00:48.649
The purpose?
I guess it makes you feel happy.

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:50.943
You should try it.

01:00:50.984 --> 01:00:53.737
<i>Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha...</i>

01:00:53.779 --> 01:00:56.490
Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:00:56.532 --> 01:00:57.908
Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha!

01:00:58.784 --> 01:01:02.162
- Nothing. No sign of them at all.
- That's wonderful.

01:01:02.204 --> 01:01:06.750
I just lost two of the most important
discoveries of the 20th century.

01:01:06.792 --> 01:01:11.296
- What else could possibly go wrong?
- Sir, it's the kid's father.

01:01:14.383 --> 01:01:15.384
Faraday.

01:01:15.425 --> 01:01:18.804
Dr, Faraday, how's David?

01:01:19.555 --> 01:01:24.476
Well, uh, actually, Bill, it's been
kind of a rough day for all of us here.

01:01:24.518 --> 01:01:26.270
Ah,

01:01:26.311 --> 01:01:28.355
Well, is he there now? Can I talk to him?

01:01:29.439 --> 01:01:36.446
Uh, well, he just seemed to want to have
some time to himself. Know what I mean?

01:01:36.488 --> 01:01:39.199
Well, just tell him to call me
as soon as possible. Will you do that?

01:01:39.575 --> 01:01:43.954
Sure, I will be glad to have him
call you as soon as I see him, OK?

01:01:43.954 --> 01:01:46.039
OK, Bye-bye, Bill.

01:01:46.081 --> 01:01:49.084
Who was the last person to see David?

01:01:51.128 --> 01:01:54.798
- Carolyn McAdams. An intern on the base,
- Get her. I wanna talk to her right away.

01:01:54.798 --> 01:01:59.261
- Her shift ended about an hour ago.
- Just find her!

01:01:59.303 --> 01:02:02.681
Gotta keep a lid on this somehow.

01:02:06.143 --> 01:02:11.106
I am ready to perform the mind transfer.
Sit here, Navigator.

01:02:12.483 --> 01:02:14.902
- Will this hurt?
- You will feel nothing.

01:02:14.943 --> 01:02:18.280
- Will I remember everything?
- You will retain all data.

01:02:18.322 --> 01:02:21.116
How many times
have you done this thing?

01:02:21.158 --> 01:02:23.911
- Zero.
- Zero? You mean never?

01:02:23.952 --> 01:02:27.748
I'm not gonna let you try this out on me.
What if you fry my brain?

01:02:27.789 --> 01:02:30.334
- I will not fry your brain.
- How do you know?

01:02:30.375 --> 01:02:32.878
I have been programmed
with superior intelligence.

01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:35.547
- Lie down.
- OK.

01:02:49.019 --> 01:02:51.647
- That's it?
- That's it, Davey!

01:02:51.688 --> 01:02:52.856
Davey?

01:02:52.856 --> 01:02:56.610
If you want to learn to swim, you gotta jump
in the water. Don't forget to feed Bruiser,

01:02:56.652 --> 01:02:58.362
Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce,

01:02:58.362 --> 01:03:00.572
cheese, pickles, onions
on a sesame-seed bun...

01:03:00.572 --> 01:03:03.325
Whoa! Ha-ha! This can't be happening.

01:03:03.367 --> 01:03:07.037
I think I've gotten stuff out of you that has
nothing to do with navigating this ship.

01:03:07.037 --> 01:03:08.831
You sound just like a human.

01:03:08.872 --> 01:03:11.959
No! That dumb dog will
never learn to catch a Frisbee.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.586
You are an inferior species,
you dumb dork!

01:03:14.628 --> 01:03:17.172
- Butt-face!
- Scuzz-bucket, Ha-ha!

01:03:17.214 --> 01:03:21.134
Hey, well, if you're so perfect,
what are you still doing here?

01:03:21.176 --> 01:03:24.930
I told you, I blew a fuse
when I totaled out that electrical tower.

01:03:24.972 --> 01:03:29.601
- I was checking out some daisies.
- You crashed while looking at flowers?

01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:36.692
- Sounds like you're the inferior species.
- I'll show you who's inferior. Heads up!

01:03:37.192 --> 01:03:42.364
- Hey, take it easy.
- Well, ex-cuuuuse me!

01:03:42.406 --> 01:03:44.366
You OK?

01:03:49.538 --> 01:03:52.291
Why are we going way up here,
you geek?

01:03:52.332 --> 01:03:53.667
Geek?

01:03:53.709 --> 01:03:57.671
I swear to God, if I was flying this thing,
we'd be home by now.

01:03:57.713 --> 01:03:59.548
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:03:59.590 --> 01:04:01.383
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

01:04:01.425 --> 01:04:04.178
OK, turkey, you fly it!

01:04:04.219 --> 01:04:06.805
<i>(David) OK, quit fooling around.</i>

01:04:11.226 --> 01:04:14.104
Come on, this isn't funny!

01:04:14.146 --> 01:04:15.731
Do something!

01:04:16.857 --> 01:04:21.445
- I take it back. We're equal, OK?
- Equal? You called me a geek!

01:04:24.823 --> 01:04:26.909
You're not a geek!

01:04:26.950 --> 01:04:30.204
Max, I want you to turn on
all engines now!

01:04:30.245 --> 01:04:32.456
That's an order from your navigator!

01:04:32.498 --> 01:04:34.583
Oh, now you're a navigator.

01:04:34.625 --> 01:04:36.585
So navigate already.

01:04:36.627 --> 01:04:38.795
It looks like it's out of control and falling.

01:04:38.837 --> 01:04:40.923
- Somebody shoot 'em down?
- I have no idea.

01:04:40.923 --> 01:04:43.759
Better do something, big shot.
You aren't even trying.

01:04:43.800 --> 01:04:46.303
Come on, one of these has to start it.

01:04:48.639 --> 01:04:52.559
<i>Scotty to Bridge, she
can't take much more of this, Captain.</i>

01:04:55.312 --> 01:04:57.606
20,000 feet and falling.

01:04:57.648 --> 01:05:00.275
You're getting warmer. Boiling.

01:05:00.275 --> 01:05:02.444
Scalding! Red-hot!

01:05:02.486 --> 01:05:06.615
Uh-oh, Cooling down.
Arctic. Sub-zero. Freezing.

01:05:08.158 --> 01:05:11.954
Oh, real coordinated. You'd better hurry,

01:05:11.995 --> 01:05:15.374
- Pull up.
- Impact in less than 15 seconds.

01:05:15.415 --> 01:05:18.752
You hockey puck,
it's right under your nose.

01:05:27.678 --> 01:05:28.637
Yeah!

01:05:28.679 --> 01:05:31.140
<i>He's pulled up.</i>

01:05:33.517 --> 01:05:35.978
Now if I can only steer it.

01:05:36.019 --> 01:05:38.522
No way, JosÃ©. Ha-ha!

01:05:47.156 --> 01:05:49.449
Wow!

01:05:49.491 --> 01:05:52.995
- Lucky guess.
- You! You nearly killed me.

01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:57.624
You're the one who almost crashed.
I just shut down to teach you to fly.

01:05:57.624 --> 01:05:59.793
- You liar!
- Am not.

01:05:59.835 --> 01:06:02.588
You did it to get even
with me for what I said.

01:06:02.629 --> 01:06:04.673
Did not!

01:06:04.715 --> 01:06:08.093
- You'll get yours!
- Oh, a threat.

01:06:09.178 --> 01:06:13.515
Oh, I'm really scared.
Look, I'm shaking.

01:06:14.641 --> 01:06:18.145
You know, it's not real hard
to fly this thing.

01:06:18.604 --> 01:06:19.646
Duh!

01:06:19.688 --> 01:06:24.485
The slightest little move of my hand,
and we go that way.

01:06:25.152 --> 01:06:28.697
- OK, which way to Fort Lauderdale?
- I only know what's in your head,

01:06:28.739 --> 01:06:31.700
and you don't know the way
from your house to a 7-11,

01:06:31.742 --> 01:06:35.579
<i>- I say we go right,
- You don't know your left from your right.</i>

01:06:35.621 --> 01:06:38.248
- We go left.
- OK.

01:06:39.708 --> 01:06:42.377
Dr, Faraday, we've located
the McAdams girl.

01:06:42.419 --> 01:06:45.088
She's inside the boy's house
with his parents.

01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:47.466
<i>Keep them in that house!</i>

01:06:47.508 --> 01:06:51.303
So right now he's up there somewhere,
flying around inside it.

01:06:53.055 --> 01:06:55.849
- Inside a spaceship?
- Oh, my God.

01:06:55.891 --> 01:06:57.059
Wow!

01:06:57.059 --> 01:07:00.229
See, Faraday had the ship
inside a hangar at the base,

01:07:00.270 --> 01:07:03.357
and all I know is that
it took off with David inside it.

01:07:03.398 --> 01:07:05.275
Oh, Bill, what are we gonna do?

01:07:06.068 --> 01:07:10.197
<i>Faraday, that bastard! That ba...
He's gonna wish he never met us,</i>

01:07:11.657 --> 01:07:14.785
Dad, there's some guys
coming toward the house.

01:07:14.827 --> 01:07:17.871
- Do you have a back door?
- Yes, it's back there.

01:07:19.498 --> 01:07:23.752
It was nice meeting you all,
and I'll call you if I hear anything.

01:07:24.169 --> 01:07:26.421
- Hey, let go of me.
- Sorry, Miss McAdams.

01:07:26.463 --> 01:07:28.757
I have to take you back to the base.

01:07:30.050 --> 01:07:31.927
- Mr. Freeman.
- Yes?

01:07:31.969 --> 01:07:35.848
Dr, Faraday has requested
that you remain confined to your house,

01:07:46.942 --> 01:07:49.361
<i>It's getting dark. That's not right.</i>

01:07:49.403 --> 01:07:51.488
<i>No, it's left!</i>

01:07:53.448 --> 01:07:55.450
See? There's Miami!

01:07:55.492 --> 01:07:59.037
- Come on, let's go lower.
- I told you so. I told you so.

01:08:02.207 --> 01:08:04.793
That isn't Miami. It's Tokyo!

01:08:04.793 --> 01:08:07.337
- How did we get here?
- Oops.

01:08:07.379 --> 01:08:09.298
OK, take us back up.

01:08:09.339 --> 01:08:13.010
Yeah, I knew that,
I knew this was Tokyo.

01:08:13.594 --> 01:08:17.305
<i>You are such a liar.
I'm taking over.</i>

01:08:19.308 --> 01:08:22.478
Japanese air command reports
visual contact over Tokyo, sir.

01:08:22.519 --> 01:08:25.606
- Tokyo?
- Sir, the target has left Japanese airspace.

01:08:25.647 --> 01:08:28.442
Well, where is it going now?

01:08:30.152 --> 01:08:33.863
<i>Now we'll get home. First we'll
hit California, then we'll go...</i>

01:08:33.906 --> 01:08:36.617
<i>Yeah, Mr. Know-it-all.
who got a D in Geography.</i>

01:08:36.658 --> 01:08:39.077
- How'd you know that?
- Ha-ha!

01:08:39.118 --> 01:08:44.332
I've told you that I don't know anything.
I was just trying to be a friend to David.

01:08:44.374 --> 01:08:46.667
I really hope you're not hiding
any information.

01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:50.339
- I'm not hiding anything.
- We're just trying to bring him back.

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:54.091
- They're approaching the West Coast.
- Already?

01:08:54.134 --> 01:08:57.845
- Where are they?
- Heading for San Francisco.

01:09:00.890 --> 01:09:05.687
<i>- Look, the Golden Gate Bridge,
- Rice-A-Roni, the San Francisco treat</i>

01:09:05.729 --> 01:09:09.399
Ha-ha! Don't get too close
to those cables. Agh!

01:09:10.192 --> 01:09:12.986
Be more careful. I'm a precise machine,

01:09:13.028 --> 01:09:15.072
Relax, Max.

01:09:29.044 --> 01:09:32.798
Are we there yet?
Where are we, anyway?

01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:37.386
Jeez, I have no idea where we are.
Gotta get directions.

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:40.389
<i>Hmm</i>

01:09:47.395 --> 01:09:51.358
I wonder if that's that Twisted Sister
stuff Carolyn was talking about.

01:10:03.412 --> 01:10:05.873
<i>- Come on,
- Hi.</i>

01:10:06.790 --> 01:10:09.418
You wouldn't happen to know
the way to Fort Lauderdale, would you?

01:10:09.418 --> 01:10:12.087
Try to make your directions clear
because we get lost easy.

01:10:12.129 --> 01:10:15.674
- Fly!
- Hey! Thanks for nothing!

01:10:19.136 --> 01:10:23.599
- Were those geeks, David?
- Yes, Max. Those were geeks.

01:10:24.725 --> 01:10:26.268
<i>(That looked kind of like Texas.</i>

01:10:26.268 --> 01:10:30.397
<i>Well, pardner, reckon we
better head this wagon east.</i>

01:10:31.690 --> 01:10:33.984
David, what were
those strange sounds?

01:10:34.026 --> 01:10:36.278
- Strange sounds?
- From the geeks' car.

01:10:38.989 --> 01:10:42.159
Wow. Well, that's called music.

01:10:42.201 --> 01:10:45.954
- I wanna hear more music.
- Can you pick up radio waves?

01:10:45.996 --> 01:10:48.790
I'm equipped to receive over two million
forms of radio waves.

01:10:48.832 --> 01:10:51.376
<i>- I can monitor all frequencies of electr...
- OK, OK.</i>

01:10:51.418 --> 01:10:55.631
See if you can pick up some signals
that sound like what we heard.

01:10:56.131 --> 01:10:58.634
<i>- How's this?</i>

01:10:58.634 --> 01:11:01.887
No, that's not music!
Try another station.

01:11:03.305 --> 01:11:07.476
<i>- Agh! Change it, quick!</i>

01:11:07.976 --> 01:11:13.023
<i>- Hold it. Now, this is music!</i>

01:11:19.655 --> 01:11:23.450
See, Max? You gotta move. Like this.

01:11:37.506 --> 01:11:41.051
That's it, Max! Yeah!

01:11:56.441 --> 01:11:57.484
<i>Yippee!</i>

01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:08.245
<i>I like music!</i>

01:12:11.874 --> 01:12:16.920
<i>Bizarre UFO sightings on two continents
have stirred up a lively debate in the UN.</i>

01:12:16.962 --> 01:12:18.463
<i>We'll have more at 11.</i>

01:12:19.256 --> 01:12:22.134
- 11.
- I'll keep checking.

01:12:22.676 --> 01:12:25.971
He's in south Texas,
heading across the Gulf of Mexico.

01:12:26.013 --> 01:12:28.223
He's going home.

01:12:28.223 --> 01:12:31.059
I'll need a driver and security.

01:12:37.065 --> 01:12:40.527
Al's Gator City.
This must be Florida, Max!

01:12:40.569 --> 01:12:43.989
<i>nd that must be Big Al. Ha-ha!</i>

01:12:44.031 --> 01:12:46.325
<i>Maybe he has a phone.</i>

01:13:01.465 --> 01:13:05.761
Hi, um, can I please borrow
some change to phone my parents?

01:13:10.057 --> 01:13:11.099
Thank you.

01:13:11.099 --> 01:13:13.143
Hey, Blimpo! Oink-oink!

01:13:13.185 --> 01:13:15.187
Too many Twinkies! Ha-ha!

01:13:30.661 --> 01:13:36.250
Uh, excuse me, pal, would you mind
if my wife used the little girls' room?

01:13:41.922 --> 01:13:46.552
- Dad, can we look at the flying saucer?
- Sure, go ahead.

01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:51.056
- Jackie, isn't it weird?
- Yeah.

01:13:51.974 --> 01:13:55.477
Well, your Indian village won't win any
awards, but that flying saucer's first-rate.

01:13:55.519 --> 01:13:58.689
<i>- I wonder how it's staying up.
- I don't know.</i>

01:13:58.730 --> 01:14:01.900
How long did it take to put
something like that together?

01:14:04.653 --> 01:14:08.115
It's OK. We'll just take
a look around ourselves.

01:14:08.991 --> 01:14:12.536
Look at this. I can push on the step
and it doesn't move. It just wiggles a little.

01:14:12.578 --> 01:14:16.123
Kids, get out from under there. Come on.
They don't have insurance in these places.

01:14:16.165 --> 01:14:19.334
<i>- Hello?
- Call from David Freeman.</i>

01:14:19.376 --> 01:14:24.214
Yes! It's David. We gotta talk fast.
There's NASA guys all over the place.

01:14:24.256 --> 01:14:27.634
Uh, Jeff, keep the line free.
David may call.

01:14:28.135 --> 01:14:30.471
- Where are you?
- Florida somewhere. I want to come home,

01:14:30.512 --> 01:14:34.933
but I don't know where the new house is.
Can you please give me directions?

01:14:34.975 --> 01:14:37.478
Uh, do you know the drawbridge
on 7th Street?

01:14:37.519 --> 01:14:41.940
No, I don't. Just give me a signal
that I can see from the air.

01:14:41.982 --> 01:14:45.944
<i>Don't let the NASA guys know I'm coming.
And remember, it's gonna be dark soon.</i>

01:14:45.986 --> 01:14:50.032
<i>All right, if I have to set fire
to the house...you'll find it.</i>

01:14:50.824 --> 01:14:52.784
<i>- Jeff...</i>

01:14:58.123 --> 01:15:01.210
<i>OK, that's nice.
Jackie, move just a little bit...Good.</i>

01:15:01.251 --> 01:15:04.213
Ryan, give me some smiles.
Come on, we're having a good time.

01:15:04.254 --> 01:15:08.258
I wanna get the ship in here. This is a nice
shot, All right, honey, smile. Here we go.

01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.093
Excuse me.

01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:19.269
See you later, alligator. Ha-ha!

01:15:23.232 --> 01:15:25.400
<i>Wow!</i>

01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.237
Son of a gun!

01:15:28.278 --> 01:15:31.573
He just said he wanted to phone home.

01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:42.376
<i>Wow, look at this.</i>

01:15:47.214 --> 01:15:49.424
Highway 95!

01:15:49.424 --> 01:15:52.511
OK, we'll take that straight
to Fort Lauderdale.

01:15:52.553 --> 01:15:55.180
95? I think we should take the turnpike.

01:15:55.222 --> 01:15:57.224
I'm the navigator.

01:15:58.767 --> 01:16:01.979
Whoa! Take it easy, man.

01:16:07.359 --> 01:16:10.028
<i>"I'm the navigator!
I'm the navigator!"</i>

01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:16.034
Well, Mr, Smarty-pants, I thought
Highway 95 would take us straight there.

01:16:16.076 --> 01:16:17.953
There it is.

01:16:17.953 --> 01:16:21.748
Now all we have to do
is follow this and I'm home.

01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:24.084
<i>The turnpike would've been faster,</i>

01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:29.006
<i>Come on down!</i>

01:16:30.632 --> 01:16:33.093
<i>Barbara Taylor!</i>

01:16:33.135 --> 01:16:35.554
<i>Come on down!</i>

01:16:42.603 --> 01:16:45.939
<i>That's Miami Beach down there.
We're almost home!</i>

01:16:46.482 --> 01:16:48.650
Ha-ha! All right!

01:16:48.692 --> 01:16:50.235
Where do you go next, Max?

01:16:50.235 --> 01:16:52.696
Back in time to when I picked up
my creatures.

01:16:52.738 --> 01:16:55.115
By now they're so hungry,
they could eat a zigzog.

01:16:55.157 --> 01:16:58.744
- What's a zigzog?
- Kind of like a hippo, but with feathers.

01:16:59.286 --> 01:17:01.997
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

01:17:03.123 --> 01:17:05.792
Ah-ha. There we go.

01:17:32.945 --> 01:17:35.697
Sir, tracking says they're on their way
up the Florida coastline.

01:17:35.739 --> 01:17:37.199
All right, step on it, OK?

01:17:37.199 --> 01:17:41.829
Faraday. Can you pinpoint the location
a little more precisely? It's rather general.

01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:48.210
- Is this Fort Lauderdale?
- Yes, but look at this.

01:17:48.585 --> 01:17:50.838
How are we ever gonna find them?

01:17:51.672 --> 01:17:56.260
<i>And now you're probably saying
"What do they have in store for me?"</i>

01:18:02.766 --> 01:18:06.145
<i>An exciting trip to Canada!</i>

01:18:08.355 --> 01:18:09.940
Damn.

01:18:15.737 --> 01:18:17.948
I don't believe this.

01:18:25.205 --> 01:18:30.085
<i>Where are they? Come on, Jeff,
where's that signal?</i>

01:18:39.511 --> 01:18:42.389
It's them!
I knew you'd come through, Jeff.

01:18:43.390 --> 01:18:45.017
Ooh, pretty.

01:18:48.103 --> 01:18:52.149
- Can you see him yet?
- Not yet.

01:18:52.191 --> 01:18:54.776
- We made it!
- We made it!

01:18:54.818 --> 01:18:58.071
Thanks for the great ride, Max,
It was lots of fun.

01:18:58.113 --> 01:18:59.615
It was fun for me, too, David.

01:18:59.615 --> 01:19:02.242
My friends are never gonna believe this.

01:19:02.284 --> 01:19:06.997
Oh, yeah, my friends are all
20 years old, and I'm only 12.

01:19:07.915 --> 01:19:11.960
I'd like to take you back to your
own time, but it's just too dangerous.

01:19:12.002 --> 01:19:14.922
At least now you'll be safe and sound
with your family.

01:19:20.844 --> 01:19:22.346
<i>Look!</i>

01:19:27.476 --> 01:19:31.188
Oh, no! What are
all those trucks doing here?

01:19:31.230 --> 01:19:33.190
Why can't they just leave me alone?

01:19:42.825 --> 01:19:44.284
I know what you're thinking.

01:19:44.326 --> 01:19:47.788
You're afraid they're going
to take you away again, aren't you?

01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:49.998
Yeah.

01:19:49.998 --> 01:19:52.209
I'm sorry I got you into this mess.

01:19:58.507 --> 01:20:02.094
<i>Attention, all personnel,
keep your distance from the object.</i>

01:20:02.094 --> 01:20:05.097
There may be radiation leakage.

01:20:18.902 --> 01:20:21.238
- David!
- Wait! Wait a minute!

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:25.868
Keep her back! He may be in danger.
Don't make any sudden moves!

01:20:25.909 --> 01:20:28.245
<i>- Make a large circle around behind the boy.
- Roger.</i>

01:20:28.287 --> 01:20:33.417
<i>- Wait until he's clear before you move in.
- I think we can isolate him.</i>

01:20:33.458 --> 01:20:35.961
David, come away from the ship.

01:20:37.212 --> 01:20:40.048
- Come on!
- Come on, David, Please!

01:20:40.090 --> 01:20:42.176
<i>- Goodbye, Davey,
- Come on, David, hurry!</i>

01:20:42.217 --> 01:20:44.052
Come away from the ship.

01:20:44.094 --> 01:20:47.639
I'm sorry, I don't belong here now.

01:20:47.681 --> 01:20:49.391
I love you.

01:20:49.433 --> 01:20:51.602
Take me with you, Max!

01:20:53.061 --> 01:20:57.024
You know I can't take you.
It's much too dangerous.

01:20:58.066 --> 01:21:00.402
- David, please!
- David!

01:21:00.444 --> 01:21:01.862
David!

01:21:02.154 --> 01:21:04.698
You must stay with your family.

01:21:04.907 --> 01:21:08.494
That is my family. But it's not my home.

01:21:08.494 --> 01:21:10.996
My home is back in 1978.

01:21:12.289 --> 01:21:17.002
If I stay, those scientists will treat me
like a guinea pig for the rest of my life.

01:21:17.002 --> 01:21:20.839
If you go back in time with me,
you could be vaporized.

01:21:24.968 --> 01:21:28.055
- I have to take that chance.
- It's very risky.

01:21:28.096 --> 01:21:30.140
- Are you sure, David?
- Yes.

01:21:30.808 --> 01:21:35.187
- Let's do it.
- All right, if that's your decision.

01:21:35.229 --> 01:21:36.939
Max?

01:21:39.107 --> 01:21:41.777
Will I ever see you again?

01:21:43.445 --> 01:21:46.240
I don't know.

01:21:46.281 --> 01:21:49.785
We must start the journey.
Hold on tight, Davey,

01:21:49.827 --> 01:21:52.496
I'm gonna miss you.

01:21:52.538 --> 01:21:55.123
I'm gonna miss you, too.

01:21:56.124 --> 01:21:58.502
Thanks.

01:21:58.544 --> 01:22:01.588
No big deal, really.

01:22:03.841 --> 01:22:07.094
Come on. Let's get out of here.

01:22:08.387 --> 01:22:10.472
<i>Compliance...</i>

01:22:10.514 --> 01:22:12.558
Navigator.

01:22:14.476 --> 01:22:16.562
Good luck.

01:23:36.475 --> 01:23:38.560
<i>Hey, David!</i>

01:23:39.686 --> 01:23:43.273
Come on, let's go!

01:23:43.315 --> 01:23:45.442
Come on!

01:23:54.701 --> 01:23:58.747
<i>Yeah, all right,</i>

01:24:01.083 --> 01:24:06.088
<i>Now watch, I'm writing your name,
J-E-F-F.</i>

01:24:06.129 --> 01:24:09.800
<i>Pretty tricky, huh? Don't get
Bruiser! Oh, Bruiser!</i>

01:24:09.842 --> 01:24:12.344
- There, Wanna try that?
- No, he looks OK to me.

01:24:12.386 --> 01:24:14.763
<i>Honey, be careful of the dog.</i>

01:24:14.805 --> 01:24:16.932
<i>Yeah, pretty tricky, I'll tell you.</i>

01:24:16.974 --> 01:24:19.268
Hi there.

01:24:19.268 --> 01:24:23.689
Oh, where have you been,
young man? Come on.

01:24:29.778 --> 01:24:32.322
Mom, I love you.

01:24:34.992 --> 01:24:37.619
Why, thank you, sweetheart.

01:24:37.661 --> 01:24:40.247
Well, what brought that on?

01:24:47.254 --> 01:24:49.131
Bruiser.

01:24:58.056 --> 01:25:01.393
- Are you mad at me?
- No, Jeff.

01:25:01.435 --> 01:25:03.520
I love you, too.

01:25:08.442 --> 01:25:11.528
<i>- OK,
- Which way we heading?</i>

01:25:11.570 --> 01:25:15.657
- I made reservations at the Sea View,
- Uh, that's up the Intercoastal.

01:25:15.657 --> 01:25:19.953
No, it's not. Don't you remember?
It's by the church.

01:25:19.995 --> 01:25:22.372
<i>Well, we got everything?</i>

01:25:23.499 --> 01:25:25.334
Come on, gang, let's go.

01:25:27.836 --> 01:25:29.213
Shh...

01:25:50.859 --> 01:25:54.279
<i>See you later, Navigator! Ha-ha!</i>
