<i>Hurry, hurry, step this way.</i>

02:36.531 --> 02:37.532
Get your tickets now.

02:38.158 --> 02:41.378
Don't be shut out, friend.
Step this way.

02:41.620 --> 02:44.248
See the most
wondrous sights imaginable

02:44.331 --> 02:46.208
pulled from the four corners
of the Earth.

02:46.375 --> 02:50.380
Acts to delight,
to thrill and to mystify!

02:50.545 --> 02:52.585
Walk through these gates
and into a world of wonder!

02:52.923 --> 02:57.975
She is here, ladies and gents,
live and in person.

02:58.136 --> 03:03.017
That gun-slinging, sharp-shooting
honey-pie of the Wild West.

03:03.266 --> 03:06.770
He has traveled the world and
baffled the crown princes of Europe.

03:06.937 --> 03:09.315
- He will amaze! He will astound!

03:09.481 --> 03:13.281
The Great and Powerful Oz!

03:13.568 --> 03:16.412
I always knew that I was
destined for show business.

03:16.571 --> 03:20.417
And now look at me.
A magician's assistant.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.045
To think,
an hour ago I was just

03:23.120 --> 03:24.872
selling oil cakes
on the midway.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.506
Yes, well, opportunity comes

03:26.581 --> 03:28.333
when you least expect it,
my dear.

03:31.002 --> 03:34.552
Wow! What a get-up.

03:35.257 --> 03:36.600
- You won't need this.
- Oh.

03:36.675 --> 03:40.430
You are playing
the simple country girl.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.188
Oh!

03:47.102 --> 03:50.697
A gift in honor of your debut.

03:50.772 --> 03:51.773
Oh!

03:52.065 --> 03:54.909
Now, this belonged to
my grandmother.

03:55.068 --> 03:59.539
A tsarina from Mirkutsk,
and a decorated war hero.

03:59.656 --> 04:00.703
Your grandmother?

04:00.782 --> 04:04.127
Yes. She was killed in battle,
the poor thing.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.378
Which battle?

04:05.537 --> 04:07.164
- Which battle?
- Uh-huh.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.082
Well, there are so many.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.093
You've heard
of the Battle of Kreplach?

04:12.169 --> 04:13.170
No.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.426
No? Good.
That's where she died.

04:15.589 --> 04:19.935
And this music box
was the only thing to survive.

04:25.265 --> 04:29.441
But I know that Grammie
would want you to have it.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.393
- Professor.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.440
Frank!
The sock is on the door.

04:33.523 --> 04:34.695
We're rehearsing.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.784
How many times do
I have to tell you to knock?

04:37.194 --> 04:38.446
Knock.

04:52.334 --> 04:53.301
I knocked.

04:53.376 --> 04:54.844
- What is it?
- Showtime.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.163
Why didn't you say something?

04:56.171 --> 04:58.890
Only a half a house.
Here's the take.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.930
Pitiful.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.442
All right, this is your cut.

05:14.439 --> 05:18.285
For you, the applause
will be approbation enough.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.747
Well, how do you think I feel?

05:26.785 --> 05:28.207
A man of my talents,

05:28.286 --> 05:30.129
I should be playing
the Orpheum Circuit!

05:30.288 --> 05:32.165
Instead of some dusty podunk

05:32.332 --> 05:36.053
in a second-hand jacket
falling apart at the seams.

05:36.211 --> 05:37.463
You're gonna have to patch
this thing again.

05:37.629 --> 05:38.881
- Again?
- Yeah.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.262
- Let's go. Hat!

05:41.424 --> 05:43.142
- Hat.
- Hat. Okay.

05:44.427 --> 05:46.805
- You're the new girl, huh?
- Yes.

05:46.888 --> 05:49.767
Good, we needed a new one.
The last one left us.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.773
Poor thing.
Suffered from a broken heart.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.984
Attack. Heart attack.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.408
But she's resting comfortably
now in Abilene

05:58.567 --> 06:00.319
expected to
make a full recovery.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.533
Perhaps you'd like to join her.

06:03.989 --> 06:06.458
Now, remember,
when I ask for a volunteer...

06:06.616 --> 06:08.243
I raise my hand.

06:08.660 --> 06:11.288
You are overqualified
for this job, my dear.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.623
Let's go make some magic.

06:13.790 --> 06:15.133
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:15.250 --> 06:16.627
the show has already begun.

06:17.127 --> 06:18.674
There are still
a few seats left.

06:18.837 --> 06:21.886
Don't miss your chance to see
Oz, the Great and Powerful!

06:22.007 --> 06:24.601
Journey with me now,
across those deserts

06:24.759 --> 06:29.185
to the mystical lands
of the Arabian Peninsula.

06:33.727 --> 06:37.903
For 5,000 years,

06:38.064 --> 06:42.570
her lonely spirit
has been trapped.

06:43.445 --> 06:47.575
But tonight,
we will attempt to free her.

06:48.742 --> 06:52.167
I shall require a volunteer
from the audience.

06:53.997 --> 06:55.169
Anyone.

06:57.751 --> 06:59.594
Anyone.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.513
How about you, madam?

07:09.846 --> 07:12.099
Oh! Yes, I would
like to volunteer.

07:13.516 --> 07:16.486
How kind of you. Please.

07:16.645 --> 07:19.524
Just remember what I told you.

07:19.689 --> 07:23.284
A simple country girl,
ladies and gentlemen.

07:25.528 --> 07:30.125
Now, you have nothing to fear,
just so long as you believe.

07:30.283 --> 07:32.706
For when you do believe

07:32.869 --> 07:35.463
anything is possible.

07:40.001 --> 07:43.801
You are growing sleepy.

07:44.673 --> 07:49.395
Your eyelids become heavy.

07:51.054 --> 07:52.397
Sleep!

07:57.852 --> 07:59.775
Come, Fernanda!

08:02.565 --> 08:08.288
Allow yourself to merge
with this woman before me.

08:14.035 --> 08:19.087
Can you hear me,
oh, Queen Fernanda?

08:19.874 --> 08:21.251
Yes.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.346
Then rise.

08:28.383 --> 08:31.102
Rise!

08:32.846 --> 08:36.395
I command you to rise!

08:55.660 --> 08:59.585
Rise from your tomb of sand.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.293
Rise as your spirit...

09:03.460 --> 09:04.928
I see a wire!

09:09.507 --> 09:11.430
You are mistaken, sir.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.516
I am not!

09:13.678 --> 09:15.225
There is a wire!

09:15.305 --> 09:17.649
There is a wire holding her up!

09:17.807 --> 09:18.979
A wire?

09:19.142 --> 09:21.361
I see it, too.
It's right there.

09:22.687 --> 09:24.689
Clear as day.
Can't you see 'em?

09:26.941 --> 09:28.443
He's fooling us.

09:29.152 --> 09:30.995
A wire!

09:34.532 --> 09:37.536
What need have I of wires?
Frank.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.062
Make me walk!

10:01.184 --> 10:02.811
What's that?

10:04.354 --> 10:06.402
Make me walk.

10:08.233 --> 10:10.201
Not now, kid. Let us leave the wonders...

10:10.360 --> 10:13.534
But I believe in you.

10:16.699 --> 10:20.545
Look, it's not much,
but it's all that we have.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.332
Whatever you could do.

10:26.584 --> 10:30.179
I would make you walk,
it's just...

10:31.131 --> 10:32.132
It's just that...

10:32.215 --> 10:34.092
Well, go on, then.
Make the girl walk.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.602
Make the kid walk.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.512
Come on, you big phony.

10:38.221 --> 10:39.222
Yeah, come on!

10:39.347 --> 10:42.442
I would make her walk,
of course,

10:42.600 --> 10:45.570
but unfortunately there
is a distemper in the ether tonight.

10:45.728 --> 10:47.901
Make the kid walk,
you big phony.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.236
You see?

10:50.400 --> 10:51.572
I'm sorry, but...

10:52.944 --> 10:54.537
Thank you. Thank you.

10:55.196 --> 10:57.244
Oz, the Great and Powerful.

11:00.451 --> 11:02.545
Why didn't you close
the damn curtain sooner?

11:02.704 --> 11:04.047
I was dying out there.

11:04.205 --> 11:06.207
There was nothing
you could have done.

11:06.291 --> 11:07.771
I didn't really think
it was that bad.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.887
Of course not.
You're just a trained monkey.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.929
You know, you shouldn't
be so mean to me all the time, Professor.

11:19.095 --> 11:20.938
After all,
I'm the only friend you've got.

11:21.097 --> 11:22.599
Friend?

11:22.765 --> 11:26.645
You're not my friend, Frank.
I don't need a friend.

11:28.229 --> 11:32.530
What I need is someone who knows
when to close the damn curtain.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.329
It's a woman.

11:37.447 --> 11:39.996
Ah! Finally some good news.

11:40.158 --> 11:43.287
You want me to
wind up a music box?

11:44.329 --> 11:45.956
No.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.334
Not for this one, Frank.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.512
Hey, Annie.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.133
Hello, Oscar.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.510
Hmm.

12:02.972 --> 12:04.645
You look lovely.

12:05.642 --> 12:06.643
Thank you.

12:06.809 --> 12:09.904
What is this? Gingham?

12:09.979 --> 12:12.152
You know it is.

12:13.358 --> 12:15.326
It was a wonderful show.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.113
Oh, don't tell me
you watched that debacle.

12:18.821 --> 12:21.995
I don't know why you didn't
just tell that poor girl the truth.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.958
What truth? That I'm a fake?
They would have had my head.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.169
And worse, they would have
demanded a refund.

12:29.332 --> 12:30.959
Come on, have a seat.

12:33.336 --> 12:34.963
I'll get you some tea.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.345
- Ooh!

12:40.051 --> 12:43.396
It's been a long time.
I haven't seen you since...

12:43.554 --> 12:45.306
The last time you
rolled into town.

12:46.849 --> 12:49.648
It's not often enough, Oscar, seeing you
once every few months.

12:49.811 --> 12:53.190
Well, it is a traveling circus.

12:54.315 --> 12:57.194
How's everything on the farm?
How's your ma?

12:57.360 --> 12:58.612
She didn't send me
a pie this time.

12:58.695 --> 12:59.867
I hope she's not mad.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.030
I meant to write.

13:01.197 --> 13:03.325
I need to tell you
something, Oscar.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.869
That's never a good start
to a conversation.

13:06.035 --> 13:08.879
John Gale asked me
to marry him.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.252
That's why I've come.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.551
I thought you should know.

13:18.798 --> 13:19.924
Oh.

13:23.219 --> 13:28.146
I think that's...
That's wonderful, Annie.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.735
I said I had to think about it.

13:33.438 --> 13:35.691
Oh, men love that answer.

13:38.359 --> 13:41.533
I wondered what you
thought I should do.

13:46.034 --> 13:49.288
You could do a lot worse
than John Gale.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.419
He's a good man.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.710
So are you.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.253
No.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.880
I'm not.

13:59.047 --> 14:01.926
I'm many things,
but a good man is not one of them.

14:03.551 --> 14:05.428
But you could be.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.769
If you wanted to.

14:10.099 --> 14:12.101
Well, that's just it.

14:13.102 --> 14:14.604
I don't want to.

14:15.813 --> 14:19.238
See, Kansas is full
of good men.

14:19.400 --> 14:24.076
Church-going men that get
married and raise families.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.616
Men like John Gale.

14:26.783 --> 14:28.831
Men like my father,

14:29.786 --> 14:32.835
who spent his whole
life tilling the dirt

14:32.997 --> 14:35.841
just to die facedown in it.

14:37.085 --> 14:38.962
I don't want that, Annie.

14:40.129 --> 14:43.759
I don't want to be a good man,
I want to be a great one.

14:43.925 --> 14:48.601
I want to be Harry Houdini
and Thomas Edison

14:48.763 --> 14:50.811
all rolled into one.

15:04.487 --> 15:07.536
That's all I ever
wanted for you, you know.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.706
Greatness.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.290
Then you understand.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.878
I do.

15:18.292 --> 15:20.135
But do you?

15:21.254 --> 15:23.427
Uh, Professor, you need
to look outside.

15:27.510 --> 15:30.309
No, Vlad, please.
It was his grandmother's.

15:30.388 --> 15:31.514
- Ahl

15:31.889 --> 15:33.891
I'm gonna rip him in half!

15:36.102 --> 15:37.775
- No, please!
- Get off!

15:38.020 --> 15:39.772
It was just his
grandmother's music box.

15:39.856 --> 15:41.028
It meant nothing.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.233
Oz!

15:43.860 --> 15:45.237
I have to go.

15:45.403 --> 15:47.622
Congratulations on
the engagement.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.289
Oscar.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.459
I'll see you in my dreams.

15:58.374 --> 15:59.375
Oz!

15:59.542 --> 16:01.544
I'm gonna rip your head off!

16:02.378 --> 16:04.551
Zim Zallah Bim!

16:14.974 --> 16:15.975
Oz!

16:19.729 --> 16:22.983
There he is!
He's out here!

16:23.149 --> 16:25.117
No, Vlad! Don't hurt him!

16:25.735 --> 16:26.907
Vlad!

16:27.069 --> 16:28.696
- Vlad, no!
- Whoa!

16:30.656 --> 16:32.499
I'm gonna crush you, Oz!

16:35.119 --> 16:37.121
I'm gonna crush you!

16:37.288 --> 16:38.585
Oz! Where are you going?

16:38.748 --> 16:41.627
Mr. Baum, I'll catch up
with you in Milwaukee.

16:41.792 --> 16:43.590
Half of that balloon is mine!

16:43.753 --> 16:45.300
And the other half is mine!

16:46.255 --> 16:49.259
All right, you loafers!
Roll up those tents!

16:55.139 --> 16:56.140
Oz!

16:59.602 --> 17:01.195
- No, no, no.
- You're not getting away!

17:01.604 --> 17:02.605
Where's my thing?

17:05.191 --> 17:07.535
Come here.
Get him down, Clowny.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.828
No, you don't!
Oh, no, you don't!

17:18.913 --> 17:19.880
Ah!

17:21.958 --> 17:22.959
So long, sucker!

17:23.166 --> 17:24.214
Get back here!

17:25.169 --> 17:26.295
Oz!

17:26.462 --> 17:28.339
Oz, you're gonna need these!

17:28.506 --> 17:30.304
Throw it! Now!

17:31.300 --> 17:32.643
- Hat!
- Hat!

17:34.428 --> 17:35.429
Ha-ha!

17:35.972 --> 17:37.144
You're a dead man!

17:37.306 --> 17:40.310
Farewell!
<i>Au revoir! Auf Wiedersehen!</i>

17:41.519 --> 17:42.896
Run!

17:42.979 --> 17:44.196
Run!

17:53.864 --> 17:58.540
No, no, no, no, no! No!

18:06.544 --> 18:08.512
Whoa!

18:42.872 --> 18:46.126
Please, I don't wanna die!

18:46.375 --> 18:48.298
I haven't
accomplished anything yet!

18:48.461 --> 18:51.886
Just get me out of here
and I'll do great things!

18:52.048 --> 18:54.972
Please! Give me a chance!

18:55.134 --> 18:56.727
I promise!

18:56.886 --> 18:59.605
I promise. I can change.

20:40.781 --> 20:44.502
Thank you. Thank you!

21:16.192 --> 21:18.035
Come on, come on!

21:18.861 --> 21:20.829
Come on, come on!

21:46.889 --> 21:48.061
Oh, no!

23:33.329 --> 23:34.831
No, no. No, no.
Come on, buddy.

23:36.665 --> 23:39.669
I can't swim.
No! I can't swim.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.550
Somebody, help me!

24:24.004 --> 24:25.381
Thank goodness.

24:26.548 --> 24:28.516
I thought I was dead.

24:29.760 --> 24:33.560
Unless you're an angel.
Am I in heaven?

24:36.892 --> 24:39.020
There is still hope for me!

24:39.395 --> 24:41.068
You won't regret this!

24:41.230 --> 24:43.403
I saw you fall from the sky.

24:43.524 --> 24:48.075
Oh. Uh... Yes, my balloon
hit, uh, an inverted thermal.

24:48.195 --> 24:49.538
I couldn't compensate.

24:49.947 --> 24:51.915
I'd get out
of the water if I were you.

24:52.574 --> 24:55.043
Oh. It's actually quite nice.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.250
I'd be more concerned
with the River Fairies.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.916
Their teeth are small,
but very sharp.

25:00.207 --> 25:02.756
River Fairies?
What's a River Fairy?

25:02.835 --> 25:03.836
- Ow!

25:04.420 --> 25:06.889
Ow! Get off!

25:07.881 --> 25:08.882
Ow! Ow!

25:13.095 --> 25:14.096
Psst. Psst.

25:15.931 --> 25:17.274
Go on, get out of here.

25:32.156 --> 25:34.830
Spiteful little things,
aren't they?

25:37.453 --> 25:39.922
Where...
Where am I, exactly?

25:40.080 --> 25:41.832
Where do you think you are?

25:42.458 --> 25:44.802
I have no idea. It's...

25:46.462 --> 25:48.464
It's like no place
I've ever seen.

25:48.922 --> 25:50.595
You're in Oz.

25:51.341 --> 25:52.593
Oz?

25:54.178 --> 25:55.851
But that's my name.

25:56.013 --> 25:58.015
Oscar Zoroaster
Phadrig Isaac Norman

25:58.140 --> 25:59.483
Henkle Emmanuel Ambroise Diggs.

26:00.642 --> 26:03.816
But everyone calls me Oz.

26:07.274 --> 26:10.995
I knew it!
The king's prophecy was true.

26:11.278 --> 26:13.479
He said that a great wizard
bearing the name of our land

26:13.822 --> 26:16.666
will descend
from the heavens, and save us all.

26:16.992 --> 26:18.619
And here you are.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.500
Here to claim your throne.

26:20.662 --> 26:22.005
"Claim my throne"?

26:23.123 --> 26:24.670
You mean, like a king's throne?

26:24.833 --> 26:27.382
Well, yes. Because
you will be our king.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.304
Your king?

26:29.463 --> 26:32.683
Like, in a palace with
a crown and a scepter?

26:32.841 --> 26:36.641
Yes, a beautiful scepter
and a grand palace.

26:36.804 --> 26:39.478
Oh. And you will
save all the people.

26:39.848 --> 26:42.192
Was that a gold scepter?

26:43.310 --> 26:46.405
Yes, there's more gold
than you could ever imagine.

26:46.563 --> 26:49.863
And Oz will now be
what it once was.

26:51.652 --> 26:54.030
Because you are
the Wizard, aren't you?

26:57.491 --> 26:58.913
Yes.

26:59.368 --> 27:00.870
I'm the Wizard.

27:09.419 --> 27:12.138
- What was that?
- The Wicked Witch's minions.

27:12.214 --> 27:13.575
They've been sent here
to kill you.

27:13.590 --> 27:14.716
Kill me?

27:14.883 --> 27:16.100
A wicked witch? What?

27:16.218 --> 27:17.435
- Oh!

27:18.053 --> 27:21.227
We better hurry or your reign will be
over before it's begun!

27:22.516 --> 27:23.768
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

27:26.603 --> 27:29.482
- Oh! Whoa!
- Oh!

27:36.071 --> 27:37.072
Come on!

27:41.577 --> 27:42.578
In there!

27:44.454 --> 27:45.751
Give me your leg.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.093
- Huh?

28:03.724 --> 28:07.445
Oh... Perhaps the Wicked Witch
has summoned them back.

28:08.604 --> 28:10.481
I don't think I like witches.

28:12.941 --> 28:14.113
What?

28:14.902 --> 28:17.121
I... I, too,
am a witch.

28:17.279 --> 28:19.327
I am Theodora the Good.

28:21.950 --> 28:22.951
You're not a witch.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.119
Of course I am.

28:24.286 --> 28:26.835
Where are all your warts?
Where's your broom?

28:26.997 --> 28:29.125
What would I do with a broom?

28:29.291 --> 28:30.338
Fly.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.127
With a broom?

28:33.170 --> 28:34.217
Never mind.

29:22.552 --> 29:23.678
You were afraid?

29:24.179 --> 29:25.180
Yes.

29:28.725 --> 29:30.648
That something
might happen to you.

29:45.534 --> 29:48.208
So, this Wicked Witch,

29:48.370 --> 29:50.043
just how wicked is she?

29:50.205 --> 29:51.806
She's as wicked as they come.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.550
She poisoned her own father.

29:53.875 --> 29:54.842
That's pretty wicked.

29:54.918 --> 29:57.421
He was a king
and a wizard, like you.

29:57.587 --> 29:59.715
But she wanted the throne
all to herself.

30:00.257 --> 30:01.258
Poor man.

30:02.050 --> 30:05.224
But my sister chased her away
from the Emerald City.

30:05.721 --> 30:07.473
I can't wait
for her to meet you.

30:07.639 --> 30:10.563
She was starting to doubt you'd ever
come but now she'll see.

30:10.726 --> 30:13.070
And you're going to
fix everything.

30:14.563 --> 30:15.610
Yeah.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.598
You know what I think we need?

30:46.136 --> 30:48.980
A little music.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.267
Is that magic?

30:51.433 --> 30:52.434
In a way.

30:53.226 --> 30:57.072
It's a music box.
You've never seen one?

30:57.647 --> 30:59.820
Well, this belonged to
my grandmother.

30:59.941 --> 31:02.239
A tsarina from Mirkutsk.

31:04.363 --> 31:05.455
Go on.

31:07.240 --> 31:09.083
I want you to have it.

31:11.828 --> 31:15.458
No one's ever given me anything
just because they wanted to.

31:15.624 --> 31:17.342
A pretty girl like you?

31:17.501 --> 31:19.845
With the visage
of Helen of Troy, no less?

31:19.920 --> 31:22.014
I'm sure you have
dozens of admirers.

31:22.172 --> 31:24.095
You don't know much
about witches, do you?

31:24.257 --> 31:27.511
Maybe not, but I'm told
I'm a fast learner.

31:27.969 --> 31:30.097
May I have this dance, milady?

31:32.265 --> 31:34.825
Now you're gonna tell me no one's ever
asked you to dance before.

31:35.394 --> 31:36.987
No one ever has.

31:37.145 --> 31:40.149
Then it's high time
that you learned.

31:48.824 --> 31:50.918
Put your hand here.

31:52.035 --> 31:54.379
And your other hand here.

32:09.219 --> 32:10.846
Nice, isn't it?

32:12.347 --> 32:13.894
Yes.

32:49.885 --> 32:51.011
It's incredible.

32:51.094 --> 32:52.095
Yeah.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.564
Here I thought
I'd live a lonely life

32:54.723 --> 32:55.940
and then you showed up.

32:57.893 --> 33:00.066
Not only are you the Wizard

33:01.396 --> 33:03.819
but you're the person
I belong with.

33:05.066 --> 33:07.910
Well, we sure
get along. And...

33:08.153 --> 33:09.575
And?

33:10.572 --> 33:12.324
And.

33:12.491 --> 33:15.335
Like you said,
we belong together.

33:15.410 --> 33:18.084
Oh! I was hoping
you would say that.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.589
- Yeah.

33:20.123 --> 33:21.625
Help me!

33:21.791 --> 33:24.214
Somebody, save me!

33:24.294 --> 33:25.762
That poor little creature.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.261
Wizard, we must save him.

33:29.424 --> 33:30.767
Somebody, help me.

33:31.134 --> 33:32.306
Oh, no, no, no.

33:32.761 --> 33:34.263
Allow the Wizard.

33:34.596 --> 33:35.768
Help me!
Come on!

33:36.348 --> 33:38.692
Of course I'll save this

33:38.767 --> 33:42.067
little talking monkey
in a bellhop's uniform.

33:42.229 --> 33:45.073
You, mister!
Please, hurry up.

33:45.232 --> 33:47.735
Do you have anything sharp?
Like a knife or something.

33:47.901 --> 33:49.903
How about your teeth?
What kind of teeth you got?

33:50.237 --> 33:53.286
Calm down,
it's gonna be all right.

33:53.448 --> 33:54.449
You gotta get me
out of these vines.

33:54.616 --> 33:55.993
Calm down.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.962
I'm gonna die.
It's gonna eat me.

33:59.412 --> 34:02.165
Don't worry. These vines
aren't gonna eat you.

34:02.958 --> 34:04.960
Not the vines, the lion!

34:06.836 --> 34:07.837
- Lion?

34:08.004 --> 34:09.221
We're gonna die.

34:09.464 --> 34:10.704
- We're gonna die!

34:13.301 --> 34:15.679
Eat him first!
Eat him first!

34:21.476 --> 34:23.149
Zim Zallah Bim!

34:23.311 --> 34:27.360
Be gone, coward!
Fear my greatness!

34:28.315 --> 34:30.034
- You were wonderful, Wizard.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.360
"Wizard"?

34:31.527 --> 34:33.371
You mean the prophecy was true?

34:33.530 --> 34:34.656
Indeed.

34:34.822 --> 34:36.951
All right, well,
I've saved the day.

34:37.117 --> 34:40.121
It was nothing, just a little
prestidigitatic display.

34:40.286 --> 34:42.540
- Shall we to the palace?
- Oh! Yes.

34:42.706 --> 34:43.753
Good day, sir.

34:43.831 --> 34:45.333
Wait, please, sir.

34:45.500 --> 34:47.172
My name is Finley.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.509
My master's home was ransacked
by the Wicked Witch's baboons.

34:50.672 --> 34:53.175
And I've been hiding
in these woods ever since.

34:53.341 --> 34:56.389
But now you've saved
my life, oh, Wizard.

34:56.553 --> 34:59.523
So I hereby swear
a life debt to you.

34:59.598 --> 35:00.599
No... No need.

35:00.682 --> 35:06.234
From this moment on I shall be your
loyal and faithful servant until death.

35:08.523 --> 35:10.150
Well, he is cute.

35:13.069 --> 35:14.366
All right, you're hired.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.447
Wonderful.

35:15.530 --> 35:16.747
Let's shake on it.

35:17.365 --> 35:18.366
My bag, monkey.

35:18.867 --> 35:21.541
Surely.
You must travel light.

35:24.205 --> 35:25.377
I got it.

35:26.750 --> 35:28.377
You two run along.

35:36.551 --> 35:38.394
It's the Emerald City.

35:38.553 --> 35:41.272
Just down this hill,
along the Yellow Brick Road.

35:41.431 --> 35:42.603
Wow.

35:43.058 --> 35:45.402
It'll all be ours now.

35:46.061 --> 35:48.109
It's a good thing
green is my favorite color.

35:51.608 --> 35:55.078
You are going to make the
best king Oz has ever known.

35:55.904 --> 35:57.076
Thank you.

35:57.238 --> 35:59.707
And I will be so proud
to be your queen.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.202
My queen?

36:02.285 --> 36:03.958
We'll spend
a lifetime together.

36:04.245 --> 36:05.872
But right now, there's
thousands of people in Oz

36:06.039 --> 36:09.088
waiting to witness
your miracles.

36:16.007 --> 36:19.762
Thousands?
That's a big show.

36:22.305 --> 36:23.352
Phew!

36:23.431 --> 36:24.603
What now, Wizard?

36:25.058 --> 36:28.688
Monkey, tell me again
about that life debt.

36:28.853 --> 36:30.355
- I devote my life to you.
- Mmm-hmm.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.775
Whatever you wish,
whatever you want.

36:32.941 --> 36:35.364
It is my sworn duty
to deliver for you

36:35.443 --> 36:37.616
- until the end of my days.
- Mmm-hmm.

36:37.779 --> 36:39.059
And there's
no getting out of it?

36:39.197 --> 36:41.120
None, sir.
It is irrevocable.

36:41.282 --> 36:43.455
Good.
Because I'm not the Wizard.

36:47.205 --> 36:51.210
Oh, sir, your sense of humor
is as boundless as it is wondrous.

36:51.292 --> 36:53.386
- You remind me...
- Monkey.

36:53.461 --> 36:54.929
I'm not the Wizard.

36:56.256 --> 36:58.576
Well, you could have told me
before I sealed the life debt.

36:58.717 --> 36:59.764
It's too late.

36:59.926 --> 37:01.926
You got to come clean
for that innocent young girl.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.972
I'll deal with her later.

37:04.139 --> 37:07.143
As my new assistant
all you need to know are the three "ups".

37:07.308 --> 37:08.981
Show up, keep up, shut up.

37:09.102 --> 37:10.069
But...

37:10.145 --> 37:11.146
What's the third "up"?

37:14.274 --> 37:17.448
Right. Now, listen,
I'm depending on you.

37:17.610 --> 37:19.988
We need to convince
the good people of Oz

37:20.488 --> 37:22.490
that they've found
their wizard.

37:36.171 --> 37:37.218
Hello, Knuck.

37:37.380 --> 37:39.508
Theodora, we've been
expecting you.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.434
I shall blow a fanfare.

37:42.886 --> 37:45.765
No, no, no, no.
No. Not now.

37:47.182 --> 37:49.401
This is the Wizard.

37:49.559 --> 37:50.560
How do you do, sir?

37:50.852 --> 37:52.775
- This is the Wizard?

37:52.937 --> 37:53.938
Is there a problem?

37:56.900 --> 37:58.243
Yeah.

38:00.236 --> 38:01.783
- Halt.

38:04.365 --> 38:06.083
All hail the Wizard.

38:06.242 --> 38:07.682
All hail the Wizard.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.710
All hail the Wizard.
The mightiest of mighties.

38:10.955 --> 38:12.798
The greatest, most powerful

38:12.957 --> 38:16.552
and most genuine
of real and true wizards.

38:16.628 --> 38:17.629
Thank you.

38:17.712 --> 38:21.057
A wizard above scrutiny
with no covert agenda

38:21.216 --> 38:23.639
or subversive intention
whatsoever.

38:24.427 --> 38:27.556
- Okay.
- A wizard of the highest moral rectitude.

38:27.722 --> 38:32.102
He's just a real, good,
solid wizard, everyone.

38:32.268 --> 38:34.737
The Wizard, here he is.

38:36.898 --> 38:38.070
How'd I do?

38:39.526 --> 38:40.743
Forward, march!

38:40.902 --> 38:43.075
Hello? Guys?

38:43.238 --> 38:45.206
Can I get in the carriage?

38:45.365 --> 38:47.788
Can I please
get in the carriage?

39:00.380 --> 39:03.099
- I shall blow a fanfare.
- Not now.

39:06.094 --> 39:10.474
Is that it? Is that my throne?

39:12.433 --> 39:14.231
Do you like it?

39:16.271 --> 39:17.989
I do so hope you like it,

39:18.147 --> 39:22.448
because I've been personally watching
over it awaiting your arrival.

39:22.527 --> 39:23.528
Oh...

39:23.778 --> 39:24.995
Much obliged.

39:25.154 --> 39:28.454
Praise be you are here at last

39:28.616 --> 39:31.290
and the prophecy
shall be fulfilled.

39:31.452 --> 39:35.332
Oh, this is a glorious day
for us all.

39:35.498 --> 39:40.504
And may I add, you're as
handsome a king as we've ever had.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.638
Flatterer.

39:42.797 --> 39:46.017
Who is this fetching woman?

39:47.010 --> 39:48.603
This is my sister.

39:48.761 --> 39:51.981
I am Evanora,
the royal advisor.

39:52.140 --> 39:55.815
I have been protecting the Emerald City
whilst we awaited your arrival.

39:55.977 --> 40:00.027
I am here to serve
you as I served the king before you.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.988
Well, I look forward
to being served.

40:03.151 --> 40:05.449
Oh, sister, I like him already.

40:08.323 --> 40:09.324
Oh... My scepter.

40:09.490 --> 40:12.039
Oh, yes,
go on then, have a seat.

40:12.201 --> 40:13.498
How does it feel?

40:13.661 --> 40:15.834
Fits like a glove.

40:16.789 --> 40:18.837
Goodness.
Knuck will show you to your chambers

40:19.000 --> 40:20.297
and then we can, uh...

40:20.376 --> 40:22.504
We can chat more later.

40:22.670 --> 40:25.389
Can't wait. Monkey, my bag.

40:25.548 --> 40:28.802
Yes, Wizard, right away,
oh, great and powerful one.

40:32.639 --> 40:34.159
- Thank you, sourpuss.
- Whoa!

40:34.223 --> 40:36.521
My name is Knuck!

40:39.562 --> 40:42.987
Isn't he wonderful?
Didn't I say he would come?

40:43.149 --> 40:47.029
You dare escort
that oaf in here

40:47.195 --> 40:49.823
and allow him to climb
on the hallowed throne?

40:49.989 --> 40:52.833
And why not?
He is the Wizard.

40:52.992 --> 40:55.290
"The Wizard." Or so he says.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.548
Did it not occur to you

40:58.706 --> 41:01.676
that he might be an imposter in
league with the Wicked Witch

41:01.834 --> 41:03.211
and sent here to kill us?

41:03.378 --> 41:05.221
The Wicked Witch?
Don't be ridiculous.

41:05.380 --> 41:09.226
I'm not the one
who's underestimating her cleverness.

41:11.719 --> 41:14.689
Or maybe it's you
I'm underestimating.

41:15.974 --> 41:19.820
Have you finally
joined her side, sister?

41:20.186 --> 41:24.066
I am on no one's side.
You know that.

41:24.232 --> 41:25.529
I simply want peace.

41:25.692 --> 41:27.740
It's all I ever wanted,
and the Wizard can do that.

41:27.902 --> 41:28.903
He's a good man.

41:29.070 --> 41:30.538
What do you know
about goodness?

41:30.613 --> 41:31.910
Deep down, you are wicked.

41:32.073 --> 41:33.620
I am not wicked!

41:38.579 --> 41:41.924
That temper
really is wasted on you.

41:43.501 --> 41:46.004
Do you honestly think

41:46.170 --> 41:49.720
that I could conspire
against you with her?

41:49.882 --> 41:52.601
You are my sister
and I love you.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.942
All right.

42:00.727 --> 42:04.402
But I do need proof that
he is who he claims to be.

42:04.564 --> 42:06.692
But he has already
proven himself.

42:06.858 --> 42:08.906
Not to me, he hasn't.

42:15.033 --> 42:16.455
Thank you for the tour.

42:16.617 --> 42:18.210
It's my job.

42:18.369 --> 42:19.416
Giving tours?

42:19.579 --> 42:21.377
Taking care of the king.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.132
Of course.
And on that note

42:23.291 --> 42:26.761
I was thinking it might be
nice to have a royal feast.

42:26.919 --> 42:27.886
Maybe a grand roast.

42:27.962 --> 42:32.468
You know, my sister has been telling me
that your magic is really quite powerful.

42:32.633 --> 42:33.805
Oh, really?

42:33.968 --> 42:38.599
Yes, uh, boggling to the minds
of all who witness it.

42:38.765 --> 42:40.142
Oh, I do wish I could
see it for myself.

42:40.308 --> 42:41.309
- Yes.

42:41.476 --> 42:42.978
Why not show me now?

42:43.478 --> 42:45.151
- Now?
- Here.

42:46.439 --> 42:48.487
All things in good time.

42:48.649 --> 42:51.994
And a good time for all things.

42:53.654 --> 42:56.828
So wise. So true.

42:57.825 --> 42:59.748
Well, um,
there is one last room

42:59.827 --> 43:02.171
that I would like you to see.

43:02.330 --> 43:05.504
The royal treasure of Oz.

43:13.466 --> 43:15.639
It belongs to whoever is king.

43:20.973 --> 43:22.691
It's all right, Wizard.

43:22.850 --> 43:25.353
Go and enjoy your riches.

43:32.193 --> 43:34.195
It's mine!

43:34.362 --> 43:35.830
Mine!

43:35.988 --> 43:39.117
Oh, no more second-hand suits
for you, baby!

43:39.200 --> 43:41.703
Nothing but
the silks and satins!

43:41.869 --> 43:44.292
Ali Baba!

43:47.792 --> 43:51.262
And one of these things!
What is this?

43:51.379 --> 43:54.383
- A chalice.
- A chalice!

43:54.549 --> 43:59.020
I've always wanted a chalice.
And now I've got one.

43:59.178 --> 44:02.102
Well, uh, not quite yet.

44:02.682 --> 44:05.435
You see,
you only become the king

44:05.518 --> 44:07.520
after you defeat
the Wicked Witch.

44:07.687 --> 44:09.064
That's the prophecy.

44:09.230 --> 44:12.359
And since you haven't
done that yet, you're not...

44:12.525 --> 44:14.744
- I'm not actually king.
- Not yet, no.

44:14.902 --> 44:18.156
You still have to
get rid of the Wicked Witch.

44:18.322 --> 44:19.824
Right.

44:20.741 --> 44:23.585
And killing her won't be easy.

44:23.744 --> 44:25.337
No, I don't suppose it will be.

44:25.413 --> 44:26.505
Mmm.

44:27.165 --> 44:28.667
Wait a minute.

44:28.833 --> 44:30.710
No one said anything
about killing anybody.

44:30.918 --> 44:34.764
Oh. Well, if you're not interested in
being king that's all right with me.

44:34.922 --> 44:36.344
We can just forget about
the whole thing.

44:36.507 --> 44:39.886
The gold and the rubies,
the chalice.

44:40.052 --> 44:41.645
I'm interested!

44:41.804 --> 44:44.353
I'm just not too keen
on killing a lady.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.517
She's not a lady.

44:47.435 --> 44:49.813
She's a wicked witch.

44:49.979 --> 44:53.529
And your magic is the only
thing strong enough to destroy her.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.615
All you have to do is journey
to the Dark Forest

44:56.694 --> 44:57.820
and destroy her wand.

44:57.987 --> 44:58.988
- Her wand.
- Yes.

44:59.155 --> 45:00.202
It's the source of
all her power.

45:00.364 --> 45:02.162
Without it, she dies.

45:02.325 --> 45:05.078
I haven't even said
goodbye to Theodora. She will be upset.

45:05.244 --> 45:06.370
I will talk to her
in the morning.

45:06.454 --> 45:08.015
I will tell her
how much you love her...

45:08.372 --> 45:09.464
No.

45:10.333 --> 45:12.085
No, don't...
Don't say anything.

45:12.251 --> 45:16.256
All right. I will say whatever
it is you want me to say

45:16.422 --> 45:20.598
but are you going to
save us all or not?

45:31.979 --> 45:33.322
I'm your wizard.

45:36.984 --> 45:38.702
We're really gonna do this?

45:38.861 --> 45:40.704
How hard could it be
to kill a wicked witch?

45:40.863 --> 45:42.911
Hard. Really hard.

45:43.074 --> 45:45.953
It's very, very hard
to kill a wicked witch.

45:46.118 --> 45:47.836
And what about that
poor girl back there?

45:47.912 --> 45:50.040
I think she really liked you.

45:50.206 --> 45:53.085
She'll get over me.
They always do.

45:53.251 --> 45:54.332
She's a pretty young witch.

45:54.335 --> 45:56.335
There'll be plenty
of wizards knocking at her door.

45:56.379 --> 46:00.100
Oh, every lie you tell gets us one step
closer to the Emerald City dungeon.

46:00.258 --> 46:02.135
Then don't think
of them as lies.

46:02.301 --> 46:05.430
Think of them as stepping
stones on the road to greatness.

46:05.513 --> 46:06.514
Wait, I got it.

46:06.597 --> 46:08.816
We'll turn around and go back.
You'll come clean.

46:08.975 --> 46:11.069
You apologize for lying
about being the Wizard

46:11.143 --> 46:12.770
and for lying
to that poor girl. Okay?

46:12.937 --> 46:15.440
You gotta really
seem contrite. You gotta sell it.

46:15.606 --> 46:18.450
Maybe you could even cry.
Can you cry? I could cut up an onion.

46:18.609 --> 46:19.861
We're not going back.

46:20.027 --> 46:21.495
We're gonna find
this wicked witch,

46:21.570 --> 46:22.787
steal her wand,

46:22.947 --> 46:24.449
I'll get that big pile of gold

46:24.615 --> 46:27.494
and you can have a nice
pile of bananas, all right?

46:27.660 --> 46:28.752
Bananas.

46:29.495 --> 46:30.496
Oh, I see.

46:30.579 --> 46:33.128
Because I'm a monkey,
I must love bananas, right?

46:33.291 --> 46:35.385
That is a vicious stereotype.

46:35.543 --> 46:37.216
- You don't like bananas?
- Of course I love bananas.

46:37.378 --> 46:38.550
I'm a monkey,
don't be ridiculous.

46:38.629 --> 46:39.721
I just don't like
you saying it.

46:39.797 --> 46:40.798
How about this?

46:40.881 --> 46:43.350
We offer to wash all the
windows in the Emerald City

46:43.509 --> 46:44.852
- for an entire year.
- Uh-huh.

46:44.927 --> 46:46.429
They'd have to forgive us.

46:46.595 --> 46:48.689
Or we could give them
a little help with their infrastructure.

46:48.848 --> 46:51.101
I noticed some yellow
brick potholes back there.

47:06.782 --> 47:08.750
That looks bad.

47:09.243 --> 47:10.415
We're not going down there.

47:10.578 --> 47:13.331
Someone might need our help.

47:13.497 --> 47:14.498
Not that you care.

47:14.582 --> 47:18.587
Get back here!
You get back here!

47:19.337 --> 47:22.682
We gotta get the Wicked Witch.
What are we doing over here?

47:35.019 --> 47:36.987
What happened here?

48:37.998 --> 48:39.671
Hello?

48:54.682 --> 48:55.854
- Hey, there.

48:57.101 --> 48:58.774
- Are you all right?

49:01.522 --> 49:03.775
Don't worry,
we're not gonna hurt you.

49:05.985 --> 49:07.282
This is Finley.

49:07.361 --> 49:08.362
Hi.

49:08.446 --> 49:09.618
My name is Oz.

49:11.490 --> 49:13.208
Are you...

49:13.826 --> 49:15.328
Are you the Wizard?

49:15.953 --> 49:17.830
Oh, you...
You've heard of me.

49:17.997 --> 49:19.965
Everyone has.

49:21.208 --> 49:23.552
Good. Then you know there's
nothing to be afraid of.

49:23.711 --> 49:27.011
So, just come on out of there.

49:28.007 --> 49:29.475
But I can't.

49:30.676 --> 49:33.350
Oh. All right, hold on.

49:37.558 --> 49:39.731
Get this off of you.

49:46.484 --> 49:48.236
Oh, no.

49:48.569 --> 49:52.540
I'll never get back together.

50:03.250 --> 50:05.218
Don't worry.
I think I have something.

50:05.377 --> 50:07.050
Give me that bag.

50:09.381 --> 50:12.806
I, uh, packed something...

50:13.761 --> 50:15.263
There it is.

50:16.639 --> 50:17.686
What is that?

50:17.765 --> 50:18.766
Magic in a bottle.

50:19.391 --> 50:20.734
Magic?

50:21.393 --> 50:22.895
Let's give it a try.

50:23.062 --> 50:24.780
All right.

50:28.108 --> 50:30.611
Just give it a little dab.

50:31.570 --> 50:33.117
Like so.

50:35.282 --> 50:36.909
Okay.

50:38.953 --> 50:40.500
Should work.

50:43.332 --> 50:45.130
There we go.

50:47.795 --> 50:48.796
Ta-da!

50:50.506 --> 50:51.507
Oh, no, no, no!

50:54.760 --> 50:55.761
They're coming back!

51:05.479 --> 51:07.322
It's okay.

51:11.277 --> 51:12.870
They're gone.

51:14.530 --> 51:18.251
- The Wicked Witch sent them.
- Why?

51:19.910 --> 51:21.833
Last night.

51:21.996 --> 51:25.921
The whole town was celebrating
out in the streets

51:26.083 --> 51:28.836
because we had heard
that you finally arrived.

51:29.837 --> 51:30.838
Me?

51:30.921 --> 51:33.174
Everyone was so happy.

51:35.175 --> 51:36.677
But then...

51:38.846 --> 51:40.894
But then those things flew in.

51:41.599 --> 51:43.601
And then...

51:43.767 --> 51:45.019
And then they...

51:56.405 --> 51:57.873
Here we go.

51:58.532 --> 52:00.455
Last piece.

52:12.463 --> 52:14.215
Would you like to try to stand?

52:20.554 --> 52:21.555
There.

52:22.473 --> 52:23.895
All right.

52:24.725 --> 52:26.272
There we go.

52:27.811 --> 52:29.404
Easy.

52:30.564 --> 52:31.565
Okay.

52:32.900 --> 52:34.823
- I'm gonna let you go.
- Oh!

52:37.613 --> 52:38.910
Okay.

52:41.659 --> 52:43.411
Now walk to me.

52:44.953 --> 52:46.751
I don't think I can.

52:46.914 --> 52:48.416
I think you can.

52:50.459 --> 52:51.460
Come on.

53:10.604 --> 53:11.821
All right.

53:11.980 --> 53:13.607
You did it.

53:17.277 --> 53:18.699
Thank you.

53:31.792 --> 53:34.045
"Dark Forest."

53:35.462 --> 53:37.681
All right, this is it.

53:38.173 --> 53:40.392
Just head on down that way,
about two, three hours.

53:40.551 --> 53:42.019
You'll hit the Emerald City.

53:42.177 --> 53:45.351
Tell them I sent you,
they'll take great care of you.

53:45.514 --> 53:47.187
Nice meeting you.

53:49.143 --> 53:50.235
But.

53:51.395 --> 53:53.489
I wanna go with you.

53:53.897 --> 53:55.319
What?

53:55.441 --> 53:56.567
Aw...

53:57.359 --> 53:59.202
On a witch hunt?

53:59.361 --> 54:00.829
No, you're just a little girl.

54:00.988 --> 54:03.161
I'm not as delicate as I look!

54:03.907 --> 54:04.908
That didn't hurt.

54:04.992 --> 54:06.494
I'm coming with you.

54:06.660 --> 54:09.379
Listen, we have one rule
in show business.

54:09.538 --> 54:11.540
Never work with
kids or animals.

54:11.707 --> 54:13.268
And I'm already working
with this thing.

54:13.292 --> 54:15.590
- Relax.

54:16.336 --> 54:17.508
The answer's no.

54:20.257 --> 54:22.180
Oh, no, no, no.

54:23.010 --> 54:24.887
Don't...
Don't do that.

54:25.012 --> 54:25.979
You're fine.

54:26.054 --> 54:28.022
You're gonna leave me alone.

54:28.182 --> 54:29.354
Look, you're...
You're fine.

54:29.516 --> 54:32.190
On a road in the
middle of nowhere?

54:32.352 --> 54:33.899
All you have to do
is take the Yellow Brick Road.

54:34.062 --> 54:35.234
You'll get there.

54:36.523 --> 54:38.025
It's crying again,
what do I do?

54:40.360 --> 54:41.737
Oh, no.

54:41.904 --> 54:44.032
Off. Come on. Off.

54:45.115 --> 54:46.617
Off of there!
Scat! Get off!

54:46.700 --> 54:47.821
Please let me come with you.

54:47.868 --> 54:48.869
No! Get off of there!

54:49.036 --> 54:50.629
I promise I won't bother you!

54:50.704 --> 54:51.785
No dolls on the witch hunt!

54:56.084 --> 54:57.244
- Please, let me come!
- Fine.

54:57.419 --> 54:59.296
Fine!
If you wanna come, come.

54:59.463 --> 55:01.215
We'll all go,
it'll be a big party.

55:01.882 --> 55:05.056
Great. Let's go
kill ourselves a witch!

55:41.296 --> 55:44.015
You'll die,
you'll die, you'll die!

55:45.175 --> 55:47.928
Did those crows just say
that we were gonna die?

55:48.095 --> 55:49.472
They did.

55:49.638 --> 55:51.106
Wizard?

56:01.316 --> 56:03.034
Come on.

56:14.872 --> 56:16.465
I'm scared.

56:19.293 --> 56:22.217
Think there are
ghosts out here?

56:22.379 --> 56:25.474
No. Of course not.

56:26.049 --> 56:28.677
Evil spirits maybe?

56:29.469 --> 56:32.222
The undead?

56:32.306 --> 56:33.853
The undead?

56:34.683 --> 56:36.651
Will you stop that?

56:50.490 --> 56:53.164
No. Get off!

56:53.327 --> 56:56.206
Something's got my tail.
Something's got my tail!

56:56.371 --> 56:57.543
Will you calm down?

57:02.419 --> 57:04.592
No! What is it?

57:05.172 --> 57:06.852
- Look out!
- I wanna go home!

57:07.007 --> 57:08.429
I wanna go home!

57:08.717 --> 57:10.219
- Hey!
- Hat!

57:10.344 --> 57:11.345
Thanks.

57:11.428 --> 57:12.680
Look out!

57:12.846 --> 57:14.189
- Come on.

57:16.725 --> 57:19.524
Hate the Dark Forest.
Hate the Dark Forest.

57:20.562 --> 57:23.361
Oh, my gosh. That was close.

57:24.775 --> 57:25.822
Where are we?

57:27.110 --> 57:28.737
This must be the place.

57:30.822 --> 57:33.541
So, how are you gonna
kill the Wicked Witch?

57:33.700 --> 57:36.624
All I need to do is
get her magic wand.

57:36.787 --> 57:39.165
Once I destroy that,
she's finished.

57:39.331 --> 57:40.548
Why don't you just use this?

57:40.707 --> 57:42.550
- It's got a knife!
- Where'd you get that?

57:42.709 --> 57:44.177
I'm made of china.

57:44.252 --> 57:46.550
I gotta protect myself somehow.

57:46.713 --> 57:48.056
Give me that.

57:48.215 --> 57:49.432
- Hey!

57:49.591 --> 57:52.219
- Honestly.
- "Honestly" yourself.

57:52.344 --> 57:53.721
Look.

57:57.140 --> 57:59.108
That must be her.

58:04.064 --> 58:05.566
Come on.

58:18.412 --> 58:19.755
She put down the wand.

58:19.913 --> 58:22.007
But how are we gonna get it?

58:22.666 --> 58:23.918
Hey!

58:25.168 --> 58:26.420
Now, listen up.

58:27.254 --> 58:29.131
Here's the plan.

58:29.840 --> 58:32.593
The Wicked Witch
is the triangle.

58:32.926 --> 58:36.021
Monkey, you're the X.
I'm the O.

58:36.179 --> 58:38.181
China Girl,
you're the squiggly line.

58:38.348 --> 58:40.942
I wanna be a heart.
Can I be a heart?

58:41.101 --> 58:43.854
All right, fine.
You're a heart.

58:44.021 --> 58:46.695
Okay, now, heart stays here

58:47.691 --> 58:50.786
as O makes his way over here.

58:50.944 --> 58:53.447
X counters thusly.

58:53.989 --> 58:54.990
Clear so far?

58:58.869 --> 58:59.870
Bless you.

58:59.953 --> 59:02.376
Good work. You just
sneezed away the plan.

59:02.664 --> 59:03.881
- Sorry.
- Never mind.

59:04.041 --> 59:05.793
Just go over there and make
some of your animal noises.

59:05.959 --> 59:07.599
I'll grab the wand
when she's not looking.

59:07.627 --> 59:09.504
Get out of here.

59:19.181 --> 59:21.775
Yes! Come on, come on.

59:34.321 --> 59:35.322
Oh, no!

59:46.875 --> 59:50.675
Moo!

59:51.004 --> 59:54.178
Moo!

59:54.382 --> 59:56.476
Moo!

59:56.676 --> 59:57.893
A cow?

59:58.178 --> 01:00:00.681
Moo!

01:00:04.184 --> 01:00:05.344
Come on. Come on.

01:00:06.019 --> 01:00:08.113
- Hurry!
- I got it!

01:00:08.188 --> 01:00:09.388
- Break it.
- Break it, Wizard.

01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:10.698
- All right.
- Break it!

01:00:10.857 --> 01:00:12.029
Did you say "Wizard"?

01:00:14.486 --> 01:00:15.533
No!

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:18.657
Are you really the Wizard?

01:00:19.199 --> 01:00:20.826
Um... That's
a complicated question.

01:00:20.909 --> 01:00:22.456
I mean, what is a wizard? I...

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:26.206
Um...

01:00:32.963 --> 01:00:34.806
Yes.

01:00:34.965 --> 01:00:36.308
I'm the Wizard.

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:38.389
Then there's hope.

01:00:38.552 --> 01:00:39.849
What's going on?

01:00:40.011 --> 01:00:42.810
Not sure.
I sneezed the plan away.

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:45.396
I have waited so long
to meet you.

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:48.358
So, we've never met?

01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:50.363
Certainly not.

01:00:50.814 --> 01:00:52.532
I'd remember a thing like that.

01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:54.318
You've never been to Kansas?

01:00:54.484 --> 01:00:55.986
What is Kansas?

01:00:56.153 --> 01:00:58.076
Is that where you're from?

01:00:59.072 --> 01:01:02.542
My, you must have
traveled very far to get to the Land of Oz.

01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:04.328
I did.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:07.748
I'm Glinda the Good.
The Witch of the South.

01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:10.546
I thought Evanora
was the Good Witch.

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:13.087
Evanora is
the true Wicked Witch.

01:01:13.378 --> 01:01:15.676
Conniving and as cruel
as they come.

01:01:15.839 --> 01:01:17.933
She's fooled most everyone,
including her own sister.

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:21.220
She made everyone believe
that I poisoned my father

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:23.559
- but it was her.
- Then,

01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:26.354
she's the one who
destroyed my village?

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:34.696
I'm so sorry, child.

01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:41.706
Here's your wand.

01:01:41.865 --> 01:01:44.084
Sorry I mooed.

01:01:44.659 --> 01:01:48.414
And to think,
you almost killed Glinda for a bit of gold.

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:49.581
A bit?

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:51.921
There were
mountains of it, buddy.

01:01:52.083 --> 01:01:54.131
Not that I was going to do it.

01:01:54.294 --> 01:01:56.797
I wasn't really going
to break your wand.

01:01:58.381 --> 01:01:59.928
Follow me.

01:02:04.012 --> 01:02:05.013
Okay.

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.357
No.

01:02:08.516 --> 01:02:11.770
No, no, no, no, no.
It cannot be.

01:02:12.145 --> 01:02:13.522
Curse you, Glinda.

01:02:13.688 --> 01:02:15.986
You should be dead.
I'll see you dead yet.

01:02:16.149 --> 01:02:18.698
Curse you and
your pretty little face.

01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:20.181
Sister.

01:02:20.237 --> 01:02:21.989
Sister, the Wizard is missing.

01:02:22.072 --> 01:02:24.541
I've looked everywhere,
but he's gone.

01:02:25.325 --> 01:02:27.168
What is it?

01:02:27.786 --> 01:02:29.504
Where is the Wizard?

01:02:29.829 --> 01:02:31.190
Where's the Wizard?

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:33.250
With Glinda.

01:02:36.711 --> 01:02:37.928
Then it's happening.

01:02:40.465 --> 01:02:42.888
Oh, sister, he's fulfilling
the prophecy.

01:02:43.551 --> 01:02:46.851
He'll bring her darkness
to the light and peace to the land.

01:02:47.013 --> 01:02:52.110
Yes, I'm certain that's what
is happening. It must be.

01:03:06.157 --> 01:03:07.158
Where did you get that?

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:10.036
This?

01:03:11.204 --> 01:03:12.296
Oh.

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:15.758
It was a gift. From him.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:22.596
He came to my chambers
last night.

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:25.681
Oh, how we danced.

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:27.846
- For hours, it seemed.

01:03:29.681 --> 01:03:33.060
Oh, I can still feel his body
pressed against mine.

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:36.400
Oh, sister, you were
right about him.

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:37.651
He is the great Wizard.

01:03:37.814 --> 01:03:42.945
He must be, to make me
feel the way I feel.

01:03:51.411 --> 01:03:54.130
Oh, no.

01:03:54.456 --> 01:03:56.879
Not you, too, sister?

01:03:57.042 --> 01:04:00.216
He said we would
rule Oz together.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:03.264
He said I would be his queen.

01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:04.640
Did he?

01:04:14.976 --> 01:04:18.731
Are you quite sure it wasn't
you who said it to him?

01:04:39.501 --> 01:04:42.675
You fool!

01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:05.159
Serves you right.

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:09.828
I want Glinda and that wizard
torn to shreds.

01:05:09.989 --> 01:05:13.960
Do not fail me a second time.

01:05:14.119 --> 01:05:17.168
Fly!

01:05:33.388 --> 01:05:37.814
On the day my father died,
we lost a kind and noble leader.

01:05:37.976 --> 01:05:41.606
And a dark shadow
was cast across this land.

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:45.617
I've had to stand alone
against Evanora and watch

01:05:46.443 --> 01:05:49.697
as towns were destroyed,
children were orphaned

01:05:49.863 --> 01:05:52.286
and my heart was broken.

01:05:53.199 --> 01:05:57.500
I've been unable to protect
the good people of Oz by myself.

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:03.051
With only faith in my father's
prophecy, I've waited.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:04.711
For you.

01:06:06.629 --> 01:06:11.556
Great Wizard from Kansas,
to come and set things right.

01:06:12.802 --> 01:06:13.803
Oh.

01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:16.147
So, that's the prophecy.

01:06:19.893 --> 01:06:20.894
Um...

01:06:21.352 --> 01:06:24.196
Well, you see,
when I agreed to be king,

01:06:24.355 --> 01:06:26.699
I didn't realize how
complicated all of this was.

01:06:26.858 --> 01:06:28.656
She knows.

01:06:29.611 --> 01:06:30.612
What?

01:06:30.695 --> 01:06:33.665
Evanora knows you know
the truth now. Look.

01:06:33.865 --> 01:06:34.912
Oh, no.

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:38.874
Uh...

01:06:44.709 --> 01:06:45.710
What do we do?

01:06:45.877 --> 01:06:47.094
Wizard, now is the time.

01:06:47.253 --> 01:06:48.254
The time?

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:49.760
Use your magic.

01:06:50.590 --> 01:06:51.637
Oh...

01:06:51.716 --> 01:06:54.811
My magic. Yes. Uh...

01:06:58.932 --> 01:07:00.775
I think we should run.

01:07:01.559 --> 01:07:02.685
Run?

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.445
Yeah.

01:07:05.605 --> 01:07:06.731
You heard the Wizard. Run!

01:07:06.814 --> 01:07:07.815
Let's get out of here!

01:07:07.899 --> 01:07:08.900
Let's go!

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:15.623
They're gaining on us!

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:17.287
What are you doing?

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:19.119
Is... Is that gonna stop them?

01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:20.878
I don't know.

01:07:32.215 --> 01:07:33.467
Nice work. We lost them.

01:07:33.633 --> 01:07:34.725
Phew! That was close.

01:07:34.884 --> 01:07:36.136
Yeah.

01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:40.273
Wait, I hear something.

01:07:49.107 --> 01:07:50.547
They're getting closer!

01:07:55.113 --> 01:07:56.911
Wait for me!

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.958
Look out!

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:16.676
Monkey!

01:08:17.844 --> 01:08:19.517
Little China Girl!

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:22.857
Wizard! I'm over here!

01:08:25.268 --> 01:08:27.362
- Help! Catch me, please!
- Got you!

01:08:28.979 --> 01:08:30.698
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:08:31.024 --> 01:08:32.446
I'm okay, too.

01:08:33.984 --> 01:08:34.986
Just go!

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:36.703
Great! A bunch of fog.

01:08:36.863 --> 01:08:39.286
This is her big idea
on how to save us?

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:42.372
Well, it was the best I could
do under the circumstances.

01:08:43.036 --> 01:08:44.207
Uh...

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:51.127
Oh, okay.

01:08:51.961 --> 01:08:53.133
Whoa!

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:54.546
Catch her!

01:08:55.214 --> 01:08:57.182
Get me! Don't let go!

01:08:57.383 --> 01:08:58.885
Monkey, grab her!

01:08:59.051 --> 01:09:00.252
Don't let go!
Don't let go!

01:09:00.386 --> 01:09:02.184
Pull my tail. Ow!

01:09:02.346 --> 01:09:03.439
Not so hard.

01:09:05.558 --> 01:09:07.060
They're getting closer!

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:09.353
What do we do?

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.692
What do we do?

01:09:10.854 --> 01:09:12.948
Just do what I do.

01:09:14.734 --> 01:09:16.452
- Unless you've got something.
- Uh...

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:19.201
No, you go.

01:09:22.742 --> 01:09:24.493
Wait. What are you doing?

01:09:26.287 --> 01:09:27.709
Wanda!

01:09:28.038 --> 01:09:29.040
Where are you going?

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:30.750
She said to do what she did.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:33.466
Just because she jumped off
the cliff, you're gonna jump off the cliff?

01:09:33.627 --> 01:09:35.551
I have wings.

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:38.091
- What about me?
- Come on!

01:09:42.761 --> 01:09:43.763
Um...

01:10:09.497 --> 01:10:10.794
Whee!

01:10:10.915 --> 01:10:13.134
Whoa! Oh! Oh!

01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:16.921
Whoa!

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:34.947
Wow.

01:10:47.660 --> 01:10:48.752
Whoa!

01:10:52.790 --> 01:10:54.963
Oh! Oh, Oh, Oh!

01:11:01.924 --> 01:11:03.551
These things go
kind of fast, huh?

01:11:11.601 --> 01:11:13.854
Hey, is... Is that a wall?

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:15.112
Of sorts.

01:11:15.271 --> 01:11:17.774
It repels our enemies
and protects us from harm.

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:20.534
But we're
headed straight for it.

01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:22.703
Yes, we are.

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:27.626
And going very fast.
How do you, uh...

01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:31.667
Does this thing
have any brakes? Uh...

01:11:31.746 --> 01:11:34.590
I'm going too fast!
I'm gonna die!

01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:36.592
You needn't worry, Wizard.

01:11:36.751 --> 01:11:38.378
It's a magic wall.

01:11:38.544 --> 01:11:41.548
And all good-hearted souls
get to pass through.

01:11:42.548 --> 01:11:43.891
I'm gonna die!

01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.308
Wanda!

01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:53.184
Oh!

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:07.782
It's beautiful.

01:12:22.630 --> 01:12:26.225
They've waited a long time
for you, Wizard.

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:45.695
All hail the great
and powerful Oz!

01:12:45.862 --> 01:12:47.614
Hail!

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:49.745
Thank you!

01:12:49.991 --> 01:12:51.743
Wow, you're a wonderful crowd.

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:55.129
You put the "merry" back in
"the merry Land of Oz."

01:12:59.959 --> 01:13:01.586
Hi, what's your name?

01:13:01.752 --> 01:13:03.925
- You're very beautiful.
- Oh, thank you.

01:13:04.088 --> 01:13:07.467
Girls, listen,
I am not a toy. I am not a toy!

01:13:07.633 --> 01:13:09.385
- Oz! Oz!

01:13:09.802 --> 01:13:10.803
- Hello!

01:13:11.554 --> 01:13:13.056
What? No fireworks?

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:15.350
What are fireworks?

01:13:15.683 --> 01:13:17.151
Remind me to show you sometime.

01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:21.156
Glinda, I didn't know
if you'd like these, or these.

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:24.113
They're both so beautiful,
I couldn't possibly decide.

01:13:24.734 --> 01:13:25.986
We need your help, Wizard.

01:13:26.569 --> 01:13:28.071
Please save us!

01:13:28.237 --> 01:13:30.615
You know,
I should tell you, um...

01:13:31.532 --> 01:13:35.753
I might not actually
be a wizard.

01:13:35.912 --> 01:13:37.414
Yes, I know.

01:13:37.580 --> 01:13:38.581
Oh.

01:13:38.789 --> 01:13:41.292
At least, not any kind of wizard
we were expecting.

01:13:41.876 --> 01:13:43.128
You could tell?

01:13:43.294 --> 01:13:44.637
Yes.

01:13:44.795 --> 01:13:47.674
I can also tell
you're weak, selfish,

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:50.969
slightly egotistical
and a fibber.

01:13:51.135 --> 01:13:54.309
I see.
Anything you don't know about me?

01:13:54.472 --> 01:13:56.941
Whether or not
you'll save my people.

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:59.693
No. I just told you
I'm not the Wizard.

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:02.025
But they don't know that.

01:14:03.147 --> 01:14:06.947
If you can make them believe,
then you're wizard enough.

01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:11.080
These are desperate times,
after all.

01:14:12.490 --> 01:14:15.084
Can you make them believe?

01:14:20.748 --> 01:14:24.548
Will I still get that gold?

01:14:25.419 --> 01:14:26.591
Uh-huh.

01:14:30.049 --> 01:14:32.723
Good people of Oz.

01:14:33.177 --> 01:14:36.226
Your Wizard is here!

01:14:57.451 --> 01:14:59.704
What's the matter, sister?

01:15:01.414 --> 01:15:03.758
Look at how happy they are.

01:15:03.916 --> 01:15:05.759
Do you think
she'll be his queen?

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:07.966
Well,
of course she'll be his queen.

01:15:08.337 --> 01:15:10.135
- What did you expect?

01:15:10.297 --> 01:15:12.220
You can't compete
with Glinda's charms.

01:15:12.717 --> 01:15:13.764
No one can.

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:19.270
Oh, God. Sister, it hurts.

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:21.434
Such is a broken heart.

01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:24.194
Your precious wizard
did that to you.

01:15:24.979 --> 01:15:26.856
Make it stop.

01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:29.279
Would you like me to?

01:15:40.661 --> 01:15:44.006
One bite is all it takes.

01:15:44.457 --> 01:15:48.553
One bite and your world
will change forever.

01:15:49.170 --> 01:15:54.142
One bite and your heart
will become impenetrable.

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:58.313
One bite and you and I
will finally share the throne.

01:15:58.637 --> 01:16:00.639
Unless you'd rather see
Oz and Glinda there.

01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.504
You're the wicked one.
Not Glinda.

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:28.338
Sister, you lied to me.

01:16:28.751 --> 01:16:30.879
It's nice, isn't it?

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:33.719
How clear everything becomes.

01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:48.274
What is happening to me?

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:50.439
Oh, it's just your heart
withering away.

01:16:51.565 --> 01:16:57.197
Fear not, Theodora, for soon you will
feel nothing at all except

01:16:57.363 --> 01:17:00.867
beautiful wickedness.

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:20.599
Sister?

01:17:41.740 --> 01:17:44.084
Oh, sister, you're hideous.

01:17:45.744 --> 01:17:47.121
I can cast a simple enchantment

01:17:47.288 --> 01:17:49.416
and have you looking
just the way you were before.

01:17:49.582 --> 01:17:50.674
No!

01:17:51.083 --> 01:17:53.427
This is who I am now.

01:17:56.213 --> 01:17:58.466
I want him to see me like this.

01:17:59.091 --> 01:18:02.937
I want him to know that he was the one
who made me this way.

01:18:05.556 --> 01:18:07.433
Oh, dear.

01:18:20.487 --> 01:18:23.707
It's imperative that you behave like
the great leader that they think you are.

01:18:23.866 --> 01:18:27.461
Morale is essential if we have
any hope of defeating Evanora.

01:18:27.745 --> 01:18:29.998
- And I assume you have a plan.
- No.

01:18:31.207 --> 01:18:32.800
You have a plan.

01:18:32.958 --> 01:18:35.962
You're going to lead us into battle
and take back the throne.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.554
And do we have
an army to help do this?

01:18:42.176 --> 01:18:43.302
Of sorts.

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:47.144
The Quadlings, Your Highness.

01:18:49.308 --> 01:18:50.685
You're soldiers?

01:18:50.851 --> 01:18:54.321
No, sir. Farmers, mostly.

01:18:54.480 --> 01:18:55.481
Farmers?

01:18:56.649 --> 01:18:57.741
But you can fight.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.994
No, sir.
Many of us can hoe.

01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:01.320
Oh, you can hoe.

01:19:01.528 --> 01:19:03.747
- And I can work with iron.
- That's good.

01:19:03.822 --> 01:19:05.290
- I bake bread.
- Yummy.

01:19:05.366 --> 01:19:07.118
- I can sew.
- Not so helpful.

01:19:07.201 --> 01:19:08.373
I can make a scarecrow.

01:19:08.953 --> 01:19:09.954
Ah!

01:19:10.037 --> 01:19:12.506
Well, that'll come in handy.

01:19:12.665 --> 01:19:14.338
- It might.
- Hmm.

01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:16.585
And these are the Tinkers.

01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:20.256
Are you kidding me?

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:22.971
We're tougher
than we look, Wizard.

01:19:25.261 --> 01:19:27.434
What they lack in stamina
the Tinkers make up for in ingenuity.

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:29.564
They can build anything.

01:19:31.517 --> 01:19:33.360
And I'll tell you what else.

01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:35.521
We can build anything.

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:36.863
Yeah, I got it.

01:19:37.022 --> 01:19:40.322
And we're prepared
to storm the Emerald City.

01:19:41.527 --> 01:19:43.871
If you don't keel over
on the way there.

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:47.199
Ow!

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.793
And, finally, the Munchkins.

01:20:01.839 --> 01:20:03.762
Please tell me,
you gentlemen can fight.

01:20:03.841 --> 01:20:04.842
No.

01:20:05.009 --> 01:20:06.636
But we make pretty clothes.

01:20:06.802 --> 01:20:08.349
Also, we sing.

01:20:08.762 --> 01:20:10.355
Uh, no,
that won't be necessary.

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:13.609
I like it,
I think it's cute. I hope you like it.

01:20:39.626 --> 01:20:42.129
- They do make beautiful clothes.
- All right.

01:20:42.296 --> 01:20:44.594
Now, listen, Wanda.

01:20:44.757 --> 01:20:46.225
Glinda.

01:20:47.634 --> 01:20:49.932
Guys, um, take five.

01:20:52.890 --> 01:20:57.896
Uh, Glinda, these are all
very lovely people.

01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:01.774
But do you honestly believe
that they can kill a wicked witch

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.859
and an army of flying baboons?

01:21:04.777 --> 01:21:07.155
I don't expect them
to kill anyone.

01:21:07.279 --> 01:21:08.246
What do you mean?

01:21:08.322 --> 01:21:10.825
I mean the good people of Oz
are forbidden to kill.

01:21:10.991 --> 01:21:12.789
Forbidden to...

01:21:19.375 --> 01:21:21.095
You want me to lead
an army that can't kill?

01:21:21.794 --> 01:21:24.889
If this was easy,
we wouldn't need a wizard, would we?

01:21:25.756 --> 01:21:27.679
Somethings wrong!

01:21:28.050 --> 01:21:29.802
- Look!
- What is that?

01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:32.892
- The wall!
- What's happening?

01:21:33.180 --> 01:21:35.660
The Wicked Witch isn't
powerful enough to get through the wall.

01:21:36.392 --> 01:21:38.394
It looks like she's managing.

01:21:39.019 --> 01:21:41.363
Not by herself, she isn't.

01:21:41.522 --> 01:21:42.899
What does that mean?
Is someone helping her?

01:21:43.065 --> 01:21:44.317
Everyone, take cover!

01:21:44.483 --> 01:21:46.485
Run quickly! Take cover!

01:21:48.112 --> 01:21:50.456
Get the children to safety!
Run!

01:21:51.323 --> 01:21:52.324
Glinda!

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:52.222
There's so much good here.

01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:55.479
It sickens me.

01:22:59.016 --> 01:22:59.983
Ah!

01:23:00.058 --> 01:23:03.813
Still think your Wizard
can save you from the likes of me?

01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:11.074
Speak up, or I will
tear out your tongue!

01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:12.658
Now, who is that?

01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:16.580
Don't you recognize me, Wizard?

01:23:17.784 --> 01:23:19.502
Have I changed so much?

01:23:20.537 --> 01:23:21.538
Theodora?

01:23:22.789 --> 01:23:24.917
May I have this dance?

01:23:26.210 --> 01:23:27.427
Huh?

01:23:28.462 --> 01:23:29.759
Hey, hey!

01:23:32.090 --> 01:23:34.263
I get it!
You're a little upset!

01:23:40.390 --> 01:23:43.485
Theodora, stop.
You're hurting him.

01:23:57.157 --> 01:24:00.127
Theodora, what happened to you?

01:24:00.285 --> 01:24:01.707
You happened to me.

01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:09.837
This isn't you.

01:24:10.504 --> 01:24:13.883
It's your sister.
She's worked her magic on you.

01:24:14.132 --> 01:24:16.305
I'd hoped you'd be able
to see through her.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:19.563
Oh, Glinda, so naive.

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:23.354
Just like your father.

01:24:23.517 --> 01:24:26.612
That's why it was so easy
for my sister to kill him.

01:24:28.230 --> 01:24:32.986
She only killed a man,
not what he believed in.

01:24:33.277 --> 01:24:35.746
Begone, Witch, before
the Wizard makes mush of you!

01:24:39.449 --> 01:24:40.450
Oh.

01:24:40.909 --> 01:24:43.003
How sweet.

01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:46.839
You all believe in him.

01:24:49.001 --> 01:24:50.753
Well, so did I, once.

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:54.973
And as for you

01:24:55.132 --> 01:24:58.807
my pretty one.

01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:02.519
When I return with
my sister and her army

01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:04.809
the Yellow Brick Road
will be red with the blood

01:25:04.975 --> 01:25:10.072
of every Tinker, farmer and
Munchkin in your kingdom.

01:25:10.689 --> 01:25:13.033
You underestimate us, Theodora.

01:25:14.818 --> 01:25:18.823
We are a strong
and united people.

01:25:18.989 --> 01:25:22.038
And now the Wizard
is here to lead us.

01:25:22.743 --> 01:25:25.542
And as for your Wizard,

01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:29.208
he will be the first to die.

01:25:29.374 --> 01:25:33.550
And you will all see that he
is nothing but a deceitful,

01:25:34.046 --> 01:25:38.893
selfish and extremely
mortal man.

01:25:40.052 --> 01:25:42.100
Give me that!

01:25:43.889 --> 01:25:46.062
It was a broom that you wanted.

01:25:47.017 --> 01:25:48.610
Wasn't it, Wizard?

01:26:01.615 --> 01:26:03.117
It's all right.

01:26:04.743 --> 01:26:05.869
It's all right!

01:26:06.536 --> 01:26:09.756
She's gone now.
Don't be frightened.

01:26:09.915 --> 01:26:11.917
Now that
the Wizard is with us...

01:26:12.542 --> 01:26:13.919
Wizard?

01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:19.133
Leaving?

01:26:19.591 --> 01:26:20.763
But you promised to help us.

01:26:20.926 --> 01:26:23.554
Yeah, well, that was
before I knew what we were up against.

01:26:23.720 --> 01:26:25.814
An army and yet another
wicked witch?

01:26:25.972 --> 01:26:29.067
This one bent on destroying
everyone, especially me?

01:26:29.226 --> 01:26:30.569
We can defeat them.

01:26:30.727 --> 01:26:32.479
There must be something.

01:26:32.646 --> 01:26:34.068
Something we
haven't thought of.

01:26:34.147 --> 01:26:35.387
Something that
we're not seeing.

01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:36.612
Something we're
just on the verge of.

01:26:36.775 --> 01:26:38.277
Glinda.

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:41.117
You need a real wizard.
Better yet, a general.

01:26:41.279 --> 01:26:43.156
But you're all I have.

01:26:46.618 --> 01:26:49.292
So, you're not the wizard
I was expecting.

01:26:50.247 --> 01:26:52.591
So, you don't have the powers
I thought you'd have.

01:26:53.792 --> 01:26:55.965
But you're here.

01:26:56.128 --> 01:26:58.677
There must be a reason.

01:26:58.839 --> 01:27:02.810
Maybe you're capable
of more than you know.

01:27:05.637 --> 01:27:08.766
Glinda, I wish
I had the answer.

01:27:09.641 --> 01:27:11.814
But I'm just a con man.

01:27:13.019 --> 01:27:14.771
I'm a carnival magician.

01:27:17.274 --> 01:27:20.494
I'm just not the man
you want me to be.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.994
Someone needs to tuck me in.

01:27:30.203 --> 01:27:31.876
Yes, of course.

01:27:34.750 --> 01:27:36.218
Allow me.

01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.883
My papa used to do it.

01:27:42.966 --> 01:27:44.388
I see.

01:27:44.968 --> 01:27:47.847
Perhaps you'd prefer
the Wizard, then?

01:27:48.889 --> 01:27:51.017
Yes, please.

01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:08.617
All right.

01:28:08.950 --> 01:28:11.044
In you go.

01:28:12.329 --> 01:28:13.831
- Here you are.
- Uh-uh.

01:28:14.164 --> 01:28:15.507
Just a moment.

01:28:18.418 --> 01:28:20.420
Bring forth the covers now.

01:28:20.587 --> 01:28:21.930
Yes, ma'am.

01:28:24.925 --> 01:28:26.427
Comfy?

01:28:28.136 --> 01:28:29.433
All right. Goodnight.

01:28:29.596 --> 01:28:31.223
Do you grant wishes?

01:28:32.599 --> 01:28:33.691
Do I what?

01:28:33.850 --> 01:28:35.397
Grant wishes.

01:28:36.061 --> 01:28:37.938
The old wizard
could grant wishes.

01:28:38.522 --> 01:28:39.523
Ah.

01:28:39.606 --> 01:28:42.485
People would
travel to the Emerald City

01:28:42.567 --> 01:28:44.410
and ask him for things.

01:28:44.569 --> 01:28:48.039
And if they were
good and noble wishes,

01:28:48.198 --> 01:28:49.415
he would grant them.

01:28:49.574 --> 01:28:51.247
Is that right?

01:28:51.409 --> 01:28:54.037
Do you know what I'd wish for?

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:56.085
Hmm. A pretty dress?

01:28:57.457 --> 01:28:59.585
To have my family back.

01:29:01.962 --> 01:29:03.805
I know.

01:29:03.964 --> 01:29:05.386
I'm sorry.

01:29:06.258 --> 01:29:08.260
I can't grant wishes.

01:29:08.927 --> 01:29:11.146
I'm not that kind of wizard.

01:29:12.806 --> 01:29:14.808
That's what I thought.

01:29:16.142 --> 01:29:20.943
Um, you see, where I come
from there aren't any real wizards.

01:29:22.274 --> 01:29:25.403
Although, there is one.

01:29:27.279 --> 01:29:29.998
Thomas Alva Edison.

01:29:30.156 --> 01:29:34.502
The Wizard of Menlo Park.
A truly great man.

01:29:34.661 --> 01:29:37.790
- Did he grant wishes?
- No.

01:29:37.956 --> 01:29:41.631
But he could look into
the future and make it real.

01:29:41.793 --> 01:29:45.343
He created the electric light,
the phonograph.

01:29:45.505 --> 01:29:49.135
He created a camera that
could take moving pictures.

01:29:49.301 --> 01:29:50.678
Pictures that move?

01:29:50.844 --> 01:29:52.642
Yeah. Can you imagine?

01:29:52.804 --> 01:29:56.354
And all he had was a little
bit of wire and some glass.

01:29:56.975 --> 01:30:01.276
With almost nothing,
he made the impossible real.

01:30:01.438 --> 01:30:03.532
Is that the kind
of wizard you are?

01:30:08.778 --> 01:30:11.827
It's the kind of wizard
I'd like to be.

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:15.665
Well, you are that kind.
I can tell.

01:30:16.995 --> 01:30:22.047
I'd rather you grant wishes,
but that's a good wizard, too.

01:30:24.210 --> 01:30:26.383
Goodnight, Wizard.

01:30:33.386 --> 01:30:35.855
Glinda. I've got it.

01:30:36.473 --> 01:30:37.440
What have you got?

01:30:37.515 --> 01:30:39.688
I've got a way out
of this mess.

01:30:42.354 --> 01:30:45.699
- What is this?
- A battle plan.

01:30:49.694 --> 01:30:51.196
It's all in there.

01:30:51.821 --> 01:30:54.199
Illusion, misdirect,
sleight of hand.

01:30:54.991 --> 01:30:56.038
Look,

01:30:56.201 --> 01:30:59.831
I know I'm not the wizard
that you were expecting

01:30:59.996 --> 01:31:02.374
but I might just be
the wizard that you need.

01:31:06.586 --> 01:31:08.429
You said you were
just a con man.

01:31:08.838 --> 01:31:09.885
Precisely.

01:31:10.048 --> 01:31:11.220
Nothing but a trickster?

01:31:11.383 --> 01:31:12.384
Yes.

01:31:12.550 --> 01:31:14.018
A terrible cheat?

01:31:14.219 --> 01:31:15.516
The best there is.

01:31:15.679 --> 01:31:18.899
The carnival magician's
going to put on a show.

01:31:19.057 --> 01:31:21.776
I'll put on
the show of a lifetime.

01:31:21.935 --> 01:31:25.235
The likes of which
the Land of Oz has never seen!

01:31:26.398 --> 01:31:30.744
Magic, mystery,
prestidigitation!

01:31:32.404 --> 01:31:35.328
It'll be my greatest trick yet.

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:38.831
Tinkers, gather around!

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:40.587
Quickly, now.

01:31:40.745 --> 01:31:42.588
This is what you're
gonna build.

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:46.092
Where I come from,
this is called a praxinoscope.

01:31:46.251 --> 01:31:48.094
Although, I've made
a few modifications.

01:31:48.336 --> 01:31:51.215
It allows you to project
an image into space.

01:31:51.381 --> 01:31:52.928
Impossible.

01:31:53.091 --> 01:31:56.436
Nothing's impossible
if you put your mind to it.

01:31:56.594 --> 01:31:58.016
- Bully.
- Bully!

01:31:58.430 --> 01:32:00.933
These three roads
all lead to the Emerald City.

01:32:01.099 --> 01:32:03.522
To the east are
the deadly poppy fields.

01:32:03.601 --> 01:32:05.762
- We'll have to steer clear of them.
- Why is that?

01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:07.613
One good whiff
and it's everlasting sleep.

01:32:07.772 --> 01:32:11.447
And we're not exactly
a terrifying army when we're awake.

01:32:11.609 --> 01:32:13.907
All right.
We'll steer clear.

01:32:14.946 --> 01:32:16.789
Or maybe not.

01:32:16.948 --> 01:32:19.576
In the conjuring business,
flash is always good.

01:32:19.743 --> 01:32:21.461
Gives the audience
a little "wow".

01:32:21.703 --> 01:32:25.753
You gentlemen will be
combining sulfur rock, nitrate of potash

01:32:26.416 --> 01:32:30.216
and charcoal to create what is commonly
known as black powder.

01:32:30.628 --> 01:32:32.426
Whoa!

01:32:32.547 --> 01:32:34.891
Mr. Quimby,
we need 200 bales of hay

01:32:34.966 --> 01:32:36.593
delivered to the main road
by noon.

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:39.730
Mr. Zim, have
the Quadling carts...

01:32:51.232 --> 01:32:52.449
Looks good.

01:33:28.311 --> 01:33:30.814
My very own Winkie Guards

01:33:30.980 --> 01:33:35.531
soon you will be facing Glinda
and her army of weaklings.

01:33:35.693 --> 01:33:38.913
And when they see
our towering might,

01:33:39.072 --> 01:33:42.451
- they will run and flee for the hills and...
- No!

01:33:42.617 --> 01:33:44.961
We shall not let them flee!

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.543
We shall show them no mercy!

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:56.635
Now, I've added this
adjustable lens to your design

01:33:56.798 --> 01:33:58.721
along with a few other things.

01:33:58.883 --> 01:34:00.135
Have a look.

01:34:02.971 --> 01:34:06.817
Yes! Edison himself
would be proud.

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:13.114
Now, there's something else
I need you to do.

01:34:13.273 --> 01:34:16.072
But I'd rather
you just keep it between us.

01:34:16.234 --> 01:34:17.486
Yes?

01:34:18.319 --> 01:34:21.163
Do you know how
to build a hot air balloon?

01:34:30.623 --> 01:34:32.000
This is all very impressive

01:34:32.167 --> 01:34:33.885
but you still haven't
told me how you plan

01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:35.633
to get this thing
into the Emerald City.

01:34:35.712 --> 01:34:37.714
Relax. I know someone.

01:34:37.881 --> 01:34:39.554
What do you mean
you know someone?

01:34:39.799 --> 01:34:41.597
Hello, Wizard.

01:34:41.759 --> 01:34:45.559
Well, well, well.
If it isn't old Sourpuss.

01:34:45.638 --> 01:34:47.185
My name is Knuck!

01:34:47.348 --> 01:34:48.709
Now, you two be
nice to each other.

01:34:48.975 --> 01:34:50.568
- Let's move it, Wizard.
- Can you give me a break?

01:34:50.643 --> 01:34:52.145
I'll break your nose!

01:34:53.021 --> 01:34:55.774
Guess I'm up.
Time to do what I do, right?

01:34:56.024 --> 01:34:57.025
Cue the con man.

01:34:57.108 --> 01:35:00.203
Would you stop? A con man
couldn't have done all this.

01:35:00.445 --> 01:35:02.322
You're much more than that.

01:35:02.947 --> 01:35:05.496
Well, then, it looks like
I've got you fooled, too.

01:35:05.950 --> 01:35:08.954
The only person you've
got fooled is yourself.

01:35:31.809 --> 01:35:33.732
For protection.

01:35:34.812 --> 01:35:35.813
Not that you need it.

01:35:48.826 --> 01:35:51.079
Great people of Oz.

01:35:51.246 --> 01:35:54.125
Today we fight to free the land

01:35:54.207 --> 01:35:56.255
from the villainy
of the Wicked Witches.

01:35:57.543 --> 01:35:59.341
We are few

01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:00.756
but we are mighty!

01:36:01.965 --> 01:36:03.433
- Quadlings.

01:36:03.633 --> 01:36:05.260
- Tinkers.
- Bully!

01:36:05.426 --> 01:36:07.144
- Munchkins.

01:36:07.637 --> 01:36:12.188
We face great odds,
but we are armed with our courage,

01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:14.978
our hard work, and most of all,

01:36:15.603 --> 01:36:18.231
our faith in one another.

01:36:18.773 --> 01:36:22.494
We have nothing to fear
as long as we believe.

01:36:23.861 --> 01:36:25.738
For when we do believe

01:36:26.197 --> 01:36:28.040
anything is possible!

01:36:30.326 --> 01:36:31.919
Onward!

01:36:57.603 --> 01:36:58.604
Halt!

01:37:00.606 --> 01:37:02.233
Good day there,
fellow Winkie guardsman.

01:37:02.483 --> 01:37:03.564
What is your business here?

01:37:03.651 --> 01:37:04.903
Supplies for battle.

01:37:05.278 --> 01:37:07.622
We bring supplies for battle.

01:37:09.741 --> 01:37:11.789
I was told of no such delivery.

01:37:12.660 --> 01:37:13.957
Where are your
papers of transit?

01:37:15.413 --> 01:37:18.132
Why this delay?
Do you not recognize me?

01:37:18.291 --> 01:37:19.588
I'm Knuck, the City Herald.

01:37:19.751 --> 01:37:21.003
Sir, I'm just trying
to do my...

01:37:23.296 --> 01:37:24.798
- What I meant was...
- Hmm?

01:37:26.007 --> 01:37:27.008
Let them pass!

01:37:27.133 --> 01:37:29.306
Let them pass.

01:38:27.693 --> 01:38:29.491
What's this?

01:38:42.834 --> 01:38:45.553
They dare march on us?

01:38:46.629 --> 01:38:48.597
- Tear them apart!
- Fly!

01:39:38.973 --> 01:39:40.065
It's a trick.

01:39:40.224 --> 01:39:41.271
Pull!

01:39:48.900 --> 01:39:51.244
Retreat! Retreat!

01:40:06.751 --> 01:40:08.594
Curse you!

01:40:15.134 --> 01:40:17.603
Oh, it's not over yet.

01:40:19.472 --> 01:40:23.852
The fog is lifting!
Quadlings, fall back.

01:40:25.269 --> 01:40:26.486
Into the woods!

01:40:26.646 --> 01:40:27.647
Watch out!

01:40:30.983 --> 01:40:31.984
Ah!

01:40:49.502 --> 01:40:51.550
Away with her.

01:41:04.058 --> 01:41:05.230
- Oh!

01:41:43.264 --> 01:41:44.607
- Herald.
- Great Wizard.

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:45.766
Who's this?

01:41:45.850 --> 01:41:48.069
Emerald City underground.
Unload the carriage.

01:41:48.227 --> 01:41:49.979
Yes, sir. To the rear.

01:41:50.062 --> 01:41:51.063
Let's go!

01:41:51.355 --> 01:41:52.447
Let's go.

01:41:52.607 --> 01:41:53.699
You two, get the trolley.

01:41:53.858 --> 01:41:55.610
Everything's ready.
All we need now is you.

01:41:55.693 --> 01:41:56.694
Yeah, come on.

01:41:56.777 --> 01:41:57.778
I just have to do
one thing first.

01:41:57.862 --> 01:41:58.863
There's no time.

01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:00.373
- Get this carriage in position.
- Yes, sir.

01:42:00.531 --> 01:42:01.623
Hurry!

01:42:01.782 --> 01:42:03.750
I told Glinda
you would do this.

01:42:04.035 --> 01:42:06.208
She said I was wrong
about you. I guess I wasn't.

01:42:06.287 --> 01:42:07.368
What are you talking about?

01:42:07.371 --> 01:42:09.172
I'm talking about
that thing the Tinker built.

01:42:09.290 --> 01:42:11.133
- The balloon.
- What balloon?

01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:14.886
That's my cue.

01:42:15.630 --> 01:42:17.052
All right, you guys.

01:42:17.131 --> 01:42:19.429
Just remember,
stick to the plan.

01:42:19.592 --> 01:42:20.809
Stick to the plan?

01:42:20.968 --> 01:42:22.220
The plan was you.

01:42:22.303 --> 01:42:23.600
We're supposed to stick to you.

01:42:23.763 --> 01:42:25.936
You guys will do great.
So long.

01:42:26.098 --> 01:42:27.896
Come back!
We can't do it alone.

01:42:28.184 --> 01:42:30.232
- Wizard!
- Wizard, I don't know what to do!

01:42:55.961 --> 01:42:58.931
Citizens of Emerald City.

01:42:59.090 --> 01:43:03.596
Witness what happens
when you defy me.

01:43:07.098 --> 01:43:11.478
Glinda did very well for
herself today, I'll admit.

01:43:11.644 --> 01:43:12.941
Leave her alone!

01:43:13.104 --> 01:43:14.481
Unchain her, you witch!

01:43:14.647 --> 01:43:15.944
We know the truth.

01:43:16.107 --> 01:43:17.267
You poisoned the king!

01:43:17.358 --> 01:43:19.486
Guards!
Get them under control.

01:43:19.652 --> 01:43:22.656
The citizens of Emerald City
will not tolerate this!

01:43:22.822 --> 01:43:24.039
We will not!

01:43:24.115 --> 01:43:25.116
Silence!

01:43:27.243 --> 01:43:28.665
Silence!

01:43:31.872 --> 01:43:32.964
Ooh...

01:43:33.457 --> 01:43:35.585
What should I do now?

01:43:35.835 --> 01:43:38.088
I'd get your sister
and fly out of here.

01:43:38.254 --> 01:43:39.301
Really?

01:43:39.463 --> 01:43:41.136
While you still can.

01:43:41.382 --> 01:43:43.180
Well, I think I'm going to do
something quite different

01:43:43.342 --> 01:43:45.344
and I'm going to do it,

01:43:45.428 --> 01:43:49.854
ooh, very, very slowly, because

01:43:51.600 --> 01:43:58.108
I just can't take the sight
of that pretty, pretty face.

01:44:00.317 --> 01:44:02.240
Ooh, I'm going to
wipe out your light

01:44:02.361 --> 01:44:05.285
until there is nothing
left but my darkness.

01:44:06.949 --> 01:44:10.328
I have been waiting
for this for a long time.

01:44:30.681 --> 01:44:32.683
Oh, no.

01:44:34.018 --> 01:44:37.238
He said it was going to be
his greatest trick yet.

01:44:37.396 --> 01:44:40.195
Did he tell you
the trick was on us?

01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:52.044
How predictable.

01:45:15.559 --> 01:45:19.063
I knew that buffoon of yours
couldn't be the Wizard.

01:45:32.785 --> 01:45:35.288
Out of my way!

01:45:43.087 --> 01:45:44.589
Give up, Glinda.

01:45:44.755 --> 01:45:46.803
Why do you continue to resist?

01:45:47.007 --> 01:45:49.180
Because I believe
in the Wizard.

01:45:50.094 --> 01:45:51.596
So did I, once.

01:45:52.096 --> 01:45:53.769
Behold!

01:45:56.267 --> 01:45:57.610
Look!

01:45:58.018 --> 01:46:00.112
Your Wizard!

01:46:00.896 --> 01:46:02.694
Where is he going?

01:46:02.857 --> 01:46:04.404
He's abandoning us.

01:46:04.567 --> 01:46:06.444
How could he?

01:46:17.746 --> 01:46:18.963
- No!

01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:29.341
No!

01:46:43.480 --> 01:46:44.572
Aw!

01:46:44.982 --> 01:46:48.782
Not so great and powerful
after all.

01:47:01.165 --> 01:47:03.793
You, there! Move back!

01:47:20.684 --> 01:47:22.106
Hey.

01:47:28.859 --> 01:47:29.860
Hello, monkey.

01:47:30.027 --> 01:47:31.700
Oz!

01:47:32.863 --> 01:47:34.786
- I thought you were dead.
- Shh.

01:47:35.866 --> 01:47:37.163
You were crying pretty hard.

01:47:37.451 --> 01:47:38.498
Was that for me?

01:47:38.661 --> 01:47:41.460
Oh, no. Some of the smoke
got in my eyes.

01:47:41.622 --> 01:47:43.044
On. Right.

01:47:43.207 --> 01:47:46.211
Wow, you fooled everybody.

01:47:46.293 --> 01:47:48.011
That was your
greatest trick yet.

01:47:48.295 --> 01:47:49.797
That was just the opening act.

01:47:49.964 --> 01:47:52.012
Let this be the final word.

01:47:52.675 --> 01:47:54.848
Your prophecy is dead.

01:47:55.469 --> 01:47:59.099
Like the king who spoke it
and the wizard who tried to fulfill it.

01:47:59.264 --> 01:48:01.266
All dead.

01:48:01.475 --> 01:48:02.476
It's showtime.

01:48:02.559 --> 01:48:07.486
And they will be joined in
death by Glinda the Good.

01:48:13.904 --> 01:48:15.372
Farewell.

01:48:17.324 --> 01:48:19.918
Say hello to your daddy for me.

01:48:29.128 --> 01:48:32.177
The dreams of
the people live on.

01:48:59.074 --> 01:49:02.704
<i>Fear me not, good people of Oz.</i>

01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:04.793
<i>Fear me not.</i>

01:49:05.247 --> 01:49:07.249
<i>For it is I,</i>

01:49:07.416 --> 01:49:09.839
<i>the great and powerful</i>

01:49:10.002 --> 01:49:12.972
<i>Wizard of Oz!</i>

01:49:13.130 --> 01:49:16.634
More tricks?
After everything.

01:49:16.800 --> 01:49:18.768
How dare you defy us!

01:49:18.927 --> 01:49:20.474
<i>Dare?</i>

01:49:20.637 --> 01:49:23.186
<i>How dare you, wicked sisters?</i>

01:49:23.348 --> 01:49:24.770
<i>No one defies Oz!</i>

01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:28.312
Guards. Destroy him.

01:49:28.479 --> 01:49:29.981
Forward!

01:49:33.317 --> 01:49:34.660
Attack!

01:49:51.627 --> 01:49:54.050
Guards! Come back here
this instant!

01:49:58.842 --> 01:50:00.685
You thought you could kill me?

01:50:01.095 --> 01:50:02.472
<i>Me?</i>

01:50:02.638 --> 01:50:05.938
<i>Thanks to you,
I have shed my mortal shell</i>

01:50:06.100 --> 01:50:10.025
<i>and taken my
true ethereal form.</i>

01:50:11.939 --> 01:50:15.694
<i>I'm now more
powerful than ever.</i>

01:50:16.819 --> 01:50:19.663
<i>I'm invincible!</i>

01:50:19.822 --> 01:50:22.200
<i>Do you still doubt me?</i>

01:50:23.158 --> 01:50:24.876
Doubt you?

01:50:25.035 --> 01:50:27.458
I defy you!

01:50:43.971 --> 01:50:45.723
Beautifully done, sister.

01:50:45.889 --> 01:50:47.186
Thank you.

01:50:48.225 --> 01:50:49.397
Hurry.

01:50:49.893 --> 01:50:51.014
You're taking too much time.

01:50:51.478 --> 01:50:52.821
Hold.

01:50:55.482 --> 01:50:56.734
Hold.

01:51:02.156 --> 01:51:03.533
They think they're winning.

01:51:04.616 --> 01:51:05.617
Turn it back on.

01:51:07.995 --> 01:51:09.918
What? Turn it back on!

01:51:10.080 --> 01:51:11.252
Oh, we got a loose wire.

01:51:11.415 --> 01:51:12.416
Oi!

01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.581
Screw's stuck.

01:51:14.585 --> 01:51:15.586
Hold on.

01:51:16.837 --> 01:51:18.339
Use this.

01:51:21.758 --> 01:51:23.260
- Got it.
- Right.

01:51:28.599 --> 01:51:29.600
This can't be.

01:51:31.268 --> 01:51:33.612
<i>You cannot defeat me.</i>

01:51:34.438 --> 01:51:35.940
I'm immortal!

01:51:36.106 --> 01:51:41.158
<i>I am the great and powerful
Wizard of Oz!</i>

01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:46.580
<i>Now witness and observe</i>

01:51:46.742 --> 01:51:50.167
<i>as I unleash the stars!</i>

01:51:50.787 --> 01:51:53.085
<i>Behold!</i>

01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:10.353
So, those are fireworks.

01:52:18.148 --> 01:52:19.821
He is the Wizard.

01:52:24.947 --> 01:52:26.540
We got Evanora.
She's on the run!

01:52:26.823 --> 01:52:28.040
All right! We got one!

01:52:28.158 --> 01:52:29.785
- Yeah!

01:52:35.832 --> 01:52:37.675
Come back here, you coward!

01:52:37.751 --> 01:52:38.752
Glinda.

01:52:38.835 --> 01:52:39.802
It's you.

01:52:39.878 --> 01:52:42.677
And you said that
I was the weak one!

01:52:57.813 --> 01:52:59.013
I may not be able to kill you.

01:52:59.022 --> 01:53:00.820
- Now.
- Okay.

01:53:00.983 --> 01:53:03.907
But I can kill
the one you love.

01:53:06.446 --> 01:53:07.447
Higher.

01:53:07.531 --> 01:53:09.078
I'm trying.

01:53:26.383 --> 01:53:28.056
Ready! Fire!

01:53:35.142 --> 01:53:37.611
<i>Begone, Wicked Witch!</i>

01:53:37.769 --> 01:53:39.112
<i>Begone!</i>

01:53:39.271 --> 01:53:42.320
I hate you.

01:53:48.113 --> 01:53:51.458
<i>Begone, forevermore!</i>

01:53:53.076 --> 01:53:55.249
The Witch is gone!
The Witch is gone! Yes!

01:53:55.620 --> 01:53:56.667
- Whoo-hoo!
- Bully, bully!

01:53:56.830 --> 01:53:58.207
I knew we could do it.

01:53:58.290 --> 01:53:59.291
Right.

01:53:59.416 --> 01:54:02.420
<i>Theodora, I know
your wickedness</i>

01:54:02.502 --> 01:54:04.095
<i>is not your doing</i>

01:54:04.254 --> 01:54:05.597
<i>and should you ever again</i>

01:54:05.672 --> 01:54:07.766
<i>find the goodness within you</i>

01:54:08.258 --> 01:54:09.976
<i>you are welcome to return.</i>

01:54:13.013 --> 01:54:14.856
Never!

01:54:28.403 --> 01:54:30.371
Not so fast.

01:54:32.949 --> 01:54:34.997
You and I aren't finished yet.

01:54:36.912 --> 01:54:39.131
You have the throne, Glinda.

01:54:39.831 --> 01:54:41.583
What more could you want?

01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:44.173
You can't give me that.

01:54:45.045 --> 01:54:48.140
You took what mattered
most to me.

01:54:48.298 --> 01:54:50.050
My father.

01:54:50.675 --> 01:54:54.225
I'll never again feel
the comfort of his kindness

01:54:54.388 --> 01:54:56.641
but I'll settle for the
freedom of his people.

01:54:56.890 --> 01:54:58.813
Of course, Glinda.

01:54:59.559 --> 01:55:01.812
I think at the very least,
they deserve that.

01:55:11.738 --> 01:55:13.160
What's the matter, Glinda?

01:55:14.157 --> 01:55:16.000
Out of bubbles?

01:55:16.827 --> 01:55:20.502
I don't need them.
Bubbles are just for show.

01:56:42.245 --> 01:56:43.542
What have you done?

01:57:16.279 --> 01:57:18.373
Look what you've done to me!

01:57:19.783 --> 01:57:22.127
Now everyone will see you
as you truly are.

01:57:24.955 --> 01:57:29.085
In the name of my father,
I banish you from the Emerald City

01:57:29.626 --> 01:57:31.549
never to return.

01:58:05.328 --> 01:58:07.126
Good people of Oz,

01:58:07.289 --> 01:58:11.510
I have here a missive
from the great Wizard himself.

01:58:12.627 --> 01:58:15.005
"With little more
than pluck and belief,

01:58:15.171 --> 01:58:17.299
we made the
impossible happen."

01:58:18.842 --> 01:58:22.267
"As your Wizard,
I hereby decree

01:58:22.429 --> 01:58:25.023
the Land of Oz
will forever be free."

01:58:45.368 --> 01:58:47.041
Okay.

01:58:47.329 --> 01:58:48.876
Close the curtains, please.

01:58:49.039 --> 01:58:51.007
I'm trying.

01:58:51.166 --> 01:58:52.759
All right.

01:58:54.377 --> 01:58:56.220
Let's give it a try.

01:58:57.213 --> 01:58:58.681
<i>- Is it on?</i>

01:58:59.716 --> 01:59:00.717
<i>Is this thing working?</i>

01:59:00.842 --> 01:59:02.719
It's Wonderful.

01:59:03.219 --> 01:59:04.562
<i>Well.</i>

01:59:05.639 --> 01:59:08.893
<i>If it isn't the most
beautiful witch in all of Oz.</i>

01:59:09.559 --> 01:59:11.561
<i>Hi, Glinda.</i>

01:59:13.396 --> 01:59:14.568
Hello, Wizard.

01:59:17.150 --> 01:59:18.823
Well done, Tinker.

01:59:18.902 --> 01:59:20.700
Your machine works beautifully.

01:59:20.904 --> 01:59:22.906
That's just workmanship.

01:59:23.573 --> 01:59:26.543
What you displayed
was real courage.

01:59:26.701 --> 01:59:29.375
Your father would have been
more than proud.

01:59:29.537 --> 01:59:32.711
He would have marveled
at the woman you've become.

01:59:35.085 --> 01:59:36.928
Zim Zallah Bim!

01:59:37.337 --> 01:59:39.431
Excellent work, everyone.

01:59:39.589 --> 01:59:42.183
Now we're ready in case anyone

01:59:42.258 --> 01:59:44.431
wants to speak with the Wizard.

01:59:44.844 --> 01:59:46.221
Now, remember,

01:59:46.388 --> 01:59:48.390
Oscar Diggs died

01:59:48.473 --> 01:59:50.976
so that the
Wizard of Oz could live.

01:59:51.142 --> 01:59:54.942
When those witches come back,
and they will come back,

01:59:55.105 --> 01:59:58.075
we're going to need
everyone to believe.

01:59:58.233 --> 02:00:00.110
Your secret's safe with us.

02:00:00.276 --> 02:00:01.493
Good.

02:00:01.778 --> 02:00:05.078
And now it's time
for some gifts.

02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:06.207
Gifts?

02:00:06.282 --> 02:00:07.829
- Gifts?

02:00:07.909 --> 02:00:10.128
Knuck, not now.

02:00:11.246 --> 02:00:12.418
What kind of gifts?

02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:14.332
Well, you know
I can't grant wishes,

02:00:14.457 --> 02:00:16.801
so this will have to do.

02:00:17.252 --> 02:00:19.846
First, the Master Tinker.

02:00:20.004 --> 02:00:23.975
To the man who can
make anything, my lucky

02:00:25.093 --> 02:00:26.185
thingamajig.

02:00:26.636 --> 02:00:28.934
May it assist you
in the reconstruction

02:00:29.013 --> 02:00:30.356
of the Emerald City.

02:00:30.515 --> 02:00:32.813
I will cherish this forever.

02:00:33.435 --> 02:00:35.312
Thank you for your faith in me.

02:00:36.604 --> 02:00:39.483
And now for Sourpuss.

02:00:39.899 --> 02:00:41.321
My name is Knuck!

02:00:41.484 --> 02:00:44.112
Sourpuss, I grant you something

02:00:44.195 --> 02:00:45.492
you are in need of most.

02:00:45.864 --> 02:00:47.912
Something that,
where I come from

02:00:47.991 --> 02:00:49.618
can turn the saddest day

02:00:49.993 --> 02:00:52.792
into a happy one.

02:00:57.876 --> 02:00:59.878
- I don't want that.
- It is yours.

02:01:00.044 --> 02:01:02.467
- Take it back.
- I cannot.

02:01:07.218 --> 02:01:08.310
Knuck,

02:01:08.970 --> 02:01:10.347
you look nice with a smile.

02:01:12.015 --> 02:01:13.892
You do look nice.

02:01:14.350 --> 02:01:16.193
Thank you.

02:01:17.896 --> 02:01:21.241
Finley, you stood by my side

02:01:21.399 --> 02:01:25.370
when any monkey
in his right mind would have flown away.

02:01:26.154 --> 02:01:29.203
To you, I give something
that I've never given to anyone.

02:01:37.415 --> 02:01:39.588
My friendship.

02:01:41.711 --> 02:01:45.056
Now you're my partner.
You're my friend.

02:01:46.883 --> 02:01:49.261
That's all
I ever really wanted.

02:01:52.222 --> 02:01:53.439
My turn, my turn.

02:01:53.556 --> 02:01:54.773
Come here.

02:01:57.852 --> 02:02:02.449
I'm afraid I can't give
you what I know you want most of all.

02:02:04.400 --> 02:02:07.074
All I can offer you is this.

02:02:10.448 --> 02:02:11.950
It's us.

02:02:14.077 --> 02:02:16.079
I know it's not the family
that you had in mind.

02:02:16.246 --> 02:02:17.589
It's perfect.

02:02:21.584 --> 02:02:23.131
Thank you.

02:02:34.180 --> 02:02:36.182
I wonder what you're gonna get.

02:02:36.349 --> 02:02:38.693
Oh, I don't need
anything, child.

02:02:38.852 --> 02:02:41.446
You better have
something for Glinda.

02:02:41.604 --> 02:02:43.106
But of course.

02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:46.943
I've saved the best for last.

02:02:49.779 --> 02:02:51.452
For you.

02:02:51.614 --> 02:02:55.994
A sight envied by all
and seen by none.

02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:57.161
You'll be astounded

02:02:57.245 --> 02:03:00.795
by what you find
behind the curtain.

02:03:05.336 --> 02:03:07.555
Oh, my.

02:03:07.755 --> 02:03:09.382
It's very tight in here.

02:03:09.549 --> 02:03:11.176
It's nice, isn't it?

02:03:12.552 --> 02:03:13.974
I know what
you're up to, Wizard.

02:03:14.137 --> 02:03:17.232
What? I'm just
giving you a tour.

02:03:17.724 --> 02:03:20.147
And I want to thank you.

02:03:20.643 --> 02:03:22.896
For opening my eyes.

02:03:23.062 --> 02:03:24.814
And what do you see?

02:03:28.484 --> 02:03:30.907
That I have everything
I ever wanted.

02:03:35.158 --> 02:03:38.537
For the record, I knew
you had it in you all along.

02:03:40.163 --> 02:03:41.665
Greatness?

02:03:41.915 --> 02:03:44.668
No. Better than that.

02:03:45.335 --> 02:03:46.587
Goodness.

02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:08.408
