WEBVTT

00:01.799 --> 00:03.533
You are being watched.

00:03.534 --> 00:07.369
The government has a secret
system -- a machine that spies

00:07.370 --> 00:10.138
on you every hour of every day.

00:10.139 --> 00:12.575
I know, because I built it.

00:13.159 --> 00:18.329
I designed the machine to detect acts
of terror, but it sees everything...

00:18.330 --> 00:21.046
Violent crimes involving
ordinary people, people like

00:21.166 --> 00:25.735
you, crimes the government
considered irrelevant.

00:25.736 --> 00:28.305
They wouldn't act, so
I decided I would.

00:28.306 --> 00:33.210
But I needed a partner -- someone
with the skills to intervene.

00:33.211 --> 00:37.078
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:37.198 --> 00:39.348
You will never find us.

00:39.349 --> 00:44.623
But victim or perpetrator, if
you're number's up, we'll find you.

00:44.973 --> 00:52.242

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

00:52.362 --> 00:54.863
Every time I close
my eyes, I see him.

00:54.864 --> 00:58.166
He won't stop.

00:58.167 --> 00:59.901
Maybe I'm already dead.

01:04.406 --> 01:06.274
Surgical three -- down that
hall, second door on the left.

01:06.275 --> 01:07.909
Yes, all right.

01:07.910 --> 01:09.409
Thank you.

01:09.410 --> 01:14.581
Mr. Davidson in eight needs a CBC,
an EKG, and a portable chest X-ray.

01:14.582 --> 01:17.451
And the kid in five needs stitches--
4-centimeter head laceration.

01:17.452 --> 01:19.619
Uh, what about the guy in four?

01:19.620 --> 01:21.355
He's, uh, been waiting
for three hours.

01:21.356 --> 01:22.622
Thank you.

01:22.623 --> 01:23.657
Hi.

01:23.658 --> 01:24.524
Hi.

01:24.525 --> 01:25.325
You look rather busy today.

01:25.326 --> 01:26.359
I was hoping to avoid this.

01:27.461 --> 01:28.862
Oh, sorry about the wait.

01:28.863 --> 01:31.364
I'm Dr. Tillman.

01:31.365 --> 01:32.565
How do you do?

01:32.566 --> 01:33.466
Hi.

01:33.467 --> 01:35.501
I see that you are
experiencing some back pain.

01:35.502 --> 01:37.871
My doctor's playing
golf in the Caymans.

01:37.872 --> 01:40.373
I just need a refill
on my pain medication.

01:40.374 --> 01:42.741
All right, on a scale of one
to five, how bad's your pain?

01:42.742 --> 01:43.842
On a good day, three.

01:43.843 --> 01:45.310
Today is not a good day.

01:45.311 --> 01:46.912
Squeeze my hands.

01:46.913 --> 01:49.381
All right.

01:49.382 --> 01:53.385
Oh.

01:53.386 --> 02:02.159
Judging from your bone grafts,
it looks like you had spinal

02:02.160 --> 02:04.161
fusion surgery about...
a year or two ago?

02:04.162 --> 02:05.062
Yeah.

02:05.063 --> 02:09.032
You know, if your pain's chronic,
there are other treatments.

02:09.033 --> 02:10.067
How were you injured?

02:11.836 --> 02:14.037
It's a long story.

02:14.038 --> 02:15.305
Mm.

02:15.306 --> 02:19.742
Please, I was hoping you might be able
to just...give me a prescription.

02:19.743 --> 02:23.079
You really should
have a full workup.

02:23.080 --> 02:29.184
C.T., MRI... but you are the most
polite patient I've seen all week, so

02:29.185 --> 02:31.987
I will make an exception.

02:31.988 --> 02:34.823
Respiratory therapist,
please pick up 7676.

02:34.824 --> 02:39.828
Respiratory therapist,
please pick up 7676.

02:39.829 --> 02:40.862
Okay, this is for three days.

02:40.863 --> 02:43.132
If you're still in pain, you
have to come back, okay?

02:43.133 --> 02:44.866
That's quite all right, Dr. Tillman.

02:44.867 --> 02:46.100
I have everything I need.

02:47.636 --> 02:50.271
Duty calls.

02:50.272 --> 02:52.240
Take care.

02:52.241 --> 02:55.009
Thanks.

02:58.981 --> 03:05.185
Machine spit out a new number?

03:05.186 --> 03:08.822
Megan Tillman -- graduated
Columbia Medical School top of

03:08.823 --> 03:11.992
her class, hasn't missed a day of
work since her residency began.

03:11.993 --> 03:13.726
Hey, Doug, I'm gonna
go grab some lunch.

03:13.727 --> 03:18.497
Page if you need me.

03:18.498 --> 03:22.654
She puts in 80 hours a week at the
hospital -- single, lives alone.

03:24.290 --> 03:25.631
Hi.

03:25.655 --> 03:27.870
Burger and fries, please.

03:30.168 --> 03:31.259
Thank you.

03:31.379 --> 03:32.635
Oh, sorry.

03:32.755 --> 03:34.862
Not at all.

03:36.000 --> 03:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:43.197 --> 03:45.923
Anybody at the hospital have
a problem with the doctor?

03:45.924 --> 03:51.795
No complaints, no malpractice lawsuits--
seems friendly, well liked.

03:51.796 --> 03:56.367
So we've got no idea why the
machine singled her out.

03:56.368 --> 03:58.369
Come on, grab a drink with us.

03:58.370 --> 04:00.270
Even workaholics
need a night off.

04:00.271 --> 04:01.038
Workaholics need rest.

04:01.039 --> 04:02.939
I'm going home and
hitting the hay.

04:02.940 --> 04:03.807
Okay.

04:03.808 --> 04:06.609
In other words... in other words, we'll
have to watch her around the clock

04:06.610 --> 04:09.345
to figure out what kind
of trouble she's in.

04:09.346 --> 04:15.651
If you'd like a raise, Mr. Reese,
all you have to do is ask.

04:22.258 --> 04:23.925
Doctor has a 6:00 A.M. shift, right?

04:23.926 --> 04:24.792
Yes, why?

04:24.793 --> 04:31.433
Looks like she's changed
her mind about going out.

04:39.374 --> 04:41.608
Girl like you shouldn't be
sitting here all alone.

04:41.609 --> 04:47.681
Guy like you should watch
where he puts his hands.

04:47.682 --> 04:48.849
Hold on, Finch.

04:48.850 --> 04:49.917
Come on.

04:49.918 --> 04:54.020
I got a guy with a gun.

04:54.021 --> 04:54.954
Hey!

04:54.955 --> 04:57.057
Baby!

04:57.058 --> 05:01.494
Hey!

05:03.830 --> 05:04.497
Hey!

05:04.498 --> 05:05.331
Oh, God!

05:05.332 --> 05:06.066
God, please, please!

05:06.067 --> 05:07.500
Not my face, please!

05:07.501 --> 05:11.103
Please.

05:13.440 --> 05:14.639
Everything all right?

05:14.640 --> 05:17.576
What happened?

05:17.577 --> 05:20.446
Had to make a pit stop.

05:22.286 --> 05:24.140
Wait.

05:25.678 --> 05:31.289
Mr. Wall Street...
Second time I've seen this guy today.

05:31.290 --> 05:32.223
You sure?

05:32.224 --> 05:35.926
Yeah, he bumped into
Tillman at the food truck.

05:35.927 --> 05:42.566
See if I can repay the favour.

05:42.567 --> 05:43.733
Dude, sorry.

05:43.734 --> 05:47.070
Watch it, man.

05:47.071 --> 05:50.640
Guy's name is Andrew Benton.

05:50.641 --> 06:01.383
He's carrying Benzodiazepine...
Roofies... date rape drug.

06:01.384 --> 06:03.447
I think we just found
the threat, Finch.

06:03.567 --> 06:05.540
We're not the only ones
following Dr. Tillman.

06:12.828 --> 06:15.390
Doctor left the club
alone around 3:30.

06:15.704 --> 06:21.930
Well... she showed up at the
hospital before sunrise,

06:21.931 --> 06:26.101
treated a twisted ankle, a heart
attack, and a cut on a hand.

06:26.102 --> 06:29.871
She hasn't stopped once, except
to get herself a cup of coffee.

06:29.872 --> 06:31.305
She's dedicated.

06:31.306 --> 06:32.674
And not just to her job.

06:32.675 --> 06:33.942
I asked the bartender.

06:33.943 --> 06:36.177
She's been at the club almost
every night of the week.

06:36.178 --> 06:37.544
A double life?

06:37.545 --> 06:40.347
A dangerous one.

06:40.348 --> 06:43.450
She's attracted some
unwanted attention.

06:45.754 --> 06:49.123
Full name is Andrew
William Benton.

06:49.124 --> 06:53.259
He's an investment banker at
Hudson Liberty Financial.

06:53.260 --> 06:54.727
Does Benton have a record?

06:54.728 --> 06:59.165
Technically, no, but there are a string
of accusations against him -- stalking,

06:59.166 --> 07:00.633
harassment, sexual assault.

07:00.634 --> 07:05.504
As far as I can tell, he's
never been formally charged.

07:05.505 --> 07:09.607
Guy fits the profile of a
sexual predator, and I think

07:09.608 --> 07:12.010
he's picked out Tillman
as his next victim.

07:14.198 --> 07:16.006
I'm in.

07:25.857 --> 07:30.027
Anything out of the ordinary?

07:30.028 --> 07:32.563
Guy likes to mark
his own territory.

07:43.066 --> 07:45.806
No coffeemaker.

07:49.446 --> 07:50.847
Mm.

07:50.848 --> 07:53.717
Benton's into
something stronger.

07:56.286 --> 07:58.587
Just got his email,
personal files.

07:58.588 --> 08:01.623
We'll see what else
this guy's into.

08:01.624 --> 08:14.736
What is that -- uh, surveillance
from the center street robbery?

08:14.737 --> 08:17.538
Your ex -- CIA guy -- is he in it?

08:18.540 --> 08:19.406
He's the star.

08:19.407 --> 08:20.474
The guy in the ski mask?

08:20.475 --> 08:21.575
How do you know it's him?

08:21.576 --> 08:22.676
I just do.

08:22.677 --> 08:24.678
But look at this.

08:24.679 --> 08:25.747
See that?

08:25.748 --> 08:27.281
Yeah.

08:27.282 --> 08:28.415
They had an exchange.

08:28.416 --> 08:29.415
Exchange?

08:29.416 --> 08:31.885
Watch.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.186
Right there.

08:33.187 --> 08:35.455
He says something
to the little guy.

08:35.456 --> 08:38.792
And look, little guy says
something back, right there.

08:38.793 --> 08:42.361
Well, did you get his
name, his address?

08:42.363 --> 08:45.298
Yeah, he's a paralegal
from Marmostein Ribner.

08:45.299 --> 08:46.866
Name's Burdett.

08:46.867 --> 08:49.068
You think this Burdett
heard something?

08:49.069 --> 08:50.236
Might lead you to your guy.

08:50.237 --> 08:52.204
Who are these women?

08:52.205 --> 08:55.575
Benton's conquests?

08:55.576 --> 09:00.212
Mm-hmm.

09:00.213 --> 09:02.314
Any of them Megan Tillman?

09:02.315 --> 09:03.515
No.

09:03.516 --> 09:05.150
He hasn't researched
her online.

09:05.151 --> 09:08.820
He hasn't even looked up the area
of her apartment or the hospital.

09:08.821 --> 09:11.690
There's nothing to connect
him to our doctor.

09:11.691 --> 09:16.295
He's careful... methodical.

09:16.296 --> 09:20.264
Maybe he wasn't
always so careful.

09:20.265 --> 09:23.801
I've been combing
through his history.

09:23.802 --> 09:27.672
Mr. Benton has an old college
record that's been expunged.

09:27.673 --> 09:30.775
Might illuminate what kind
of a man we're dealing with.

09:30.776 --> 09:35.978
But -- we need access, and I
know someone who can help.

09:35.979 --> 09:39.982
I'm not all that comfortable with your
arrangement with detective Fusco.

09:39.983 --> 09:41.050
He's an asset.

09:41.051 --> 09:43.753
He's a corrupt police officer
that tried to murder you.

09:43.754 --> 09:45.789
He's not the first person
who's tried to kill me.

09:45.790 --> 09:48.491
Fusco will stay in line.

09:48.492 --> 09:52.994
Your detective is a nice pet to keep, 
Mr. Reese, but sooner or later...

09:52.995 --> 09:56.031
he'll bite you back.

09:57.300 --> 09:57.966
What's the matter?

09:57.967 --> 09:59.468
You can't keep up with
your old man, huh?

09:59.469 --> 10:00.202
Oh!

10:00.203 --> 10:01.102
Ha!

10:01.103 --> 10:03.572
I got it.

10:03.573 --> 10:07.375
Excuse me, detective Fusco?

10:07.376 --> 10:13.448
Who are you guys supposed to be?

10:13.449 --> 10:16.351
We're supposed to be drug dealers,
except a group of very

10:16.352 --> 10:19.620
foolish cops stole
most of our product.

10:19.621 --> 10:22.021
You got me confused.

10:22.022 --> 10:25.525
Detective Stills is
the guy you want.

10:25.526 --> 10:29.028
Stills is missing, and the rest of
your dirty cop friends are in jail.

10:29.029 --> 10:32.366
That leaves you on the hook for a
million dollars worth of cocaine.

10:32.367 --> 10:34.835
We want our money.

10:34.836 --> 10:36.636
Let me go to the A.T.M.,
make a withdrawal.

10:37.604 --> 10:39.605
Dad, come on, let's play.

10:39.606 --> 10:43.242
Just a minute, buddy.

10:43.243 --> 10:47.813
Our children -- they, uh...
They see too much violence.

10:47.814 --> 10:52.485
You have a good head
on your shoulders.

10:52.486 --> 10:56.187
Bring us the money in two days,
and you get to come home to

10:56.188 --> 11:00.358
your son with it still attached.

11:00.359 --> 11:02.674
Win-win.

11:06.799 --> 11:14.137
Doctor has been parked
at the bar all night.

11:14.138 --> 11:17.941
So far, no sign of Benton.
She puts in 16 hour days at the

11:17.942 --> 11:19.276
hospital, stays out all night.

11:19.277 --> 11:21.011
Why?

11:21.012 --> 11:25.181
What's driving her?

11:25.182 --> 11:29.585
Uh, Finch, hold on a second.

11:29.586 --> 11:35.257
Man of the hour just showed up.

11:35.258 --> 11:41.696
Just a Martini, up.

11:46.469 --> 11:50.004
Long day, stressful job, finally
off the clock, and you

11:50.005 --> 11:55.343
just want some peace, but some
clueless idiot keeps bothering you.

11:55.344 --> 11:57.678
Girl alone at a bar --
what do you expect?

11:57.679 --> 12:00.047
Oh, I wasn't talking about you.

12:00.048 --> 12:03.717
In case you haven't noticed, I'm
beating them off with a stick here.

12:05.520 --> 12:06.554
Is that so?

12:06.555 --> 12:10.123
Whatever you do, do not offer
to buy me another drink.

12:10.124 --> 12:17.129
Well, I'm Kate.

12:17.130 --> 12:18.097
Andrew.

12:18.098 --> 12:19.466
It's nice to meet you.

12:19.467 --> 12:21.801
Why is she using a false name?

12:21.802 --> 12:24.971
Well, I was just about to
go get some fresh air.

12:24.972 --> 12:26.773
Yeah, you know what?

12:26.774 --> 12:31.577
Do you mind if I join you?

12:31.578 --> 12:33.211
Where are you headed?

12:33.212 --> 12:34.212
I don't know.

12:34.213 --> 12:35.213
You're the club guy.

12:35.214 --> 12:36.949
You tell me.

12:36.950 --> 12:40.719
It's 3:00 A.M., 
town's pretty much closing down.

12:40.720 --> 12:48.626
I do know a place right around the
corner -- full bar, comfy bed.

12:48.627 --> 12:50.895
Oh, your place.

12:50.896 --> 12:52.797
Oh, do you want to
go to my place?

12:53.665 --> 12:54.499
Sure.

12:54.500 --> 12:56.501
Come on, we'll do
whatever you want.

12:56.502 --> 13:00.471
We'll hang out, have some drinks--
maybe something stronger.

13:02.172 --> 13:07.410
I have to work early in the
morning, but maybe next time.

13:07.411 --> 13:15.652
You know where to find me.

13:35.871 --> 13:37.605
Wait a minute.

13:37.606 --> 13:39.240
What's she doing?

13:39.241 --> 13:42.544
I'm not sure, but she's
up to something.

13:42.545 --> 13:48.315
Finch...

13:50.445 --> 13:54.760
Finch...
Benton's not stalking the doctor.

13:55.990 --> 13:58.710
She's stalking him.

14:03.281 --> 14:04.659
It's me.

14:04.660 --> 14:06.760
I know it's late.

14:07.688 --> 14:10.883
It was my fault.
I know that now.

14:11.829 --> 14:15.536
I tried to put it out of
my head, but I can't.

14:24.876 --> 14:26.910
Easy there, Lionel.

14:27.972 --> 14:32.461
Last time you pointed a gun at me, it
didn't end in your favour, now, did it?

14:32.581 --> 14:36.297
You shouldn't sneak up like that, with
the thugs from the Toreros cartel after me.

14:37.415 --> 14:39.681
Toreros from Sinaloa?

14:39.682 --> 14:42.918
I spent a little
time in Mexico.

14:42.919 --> 14:44.825
You know that they're
a death squad.

14:44.945 --> 14:47.274
You cross them, and your
head winds up in a bag.

14:47.394 --> 14:49.350
But you've already crossed them.

14:49.680 --> 14:53.027
Andrew Benton's expunged
record -- do you have it?

14:53.147 --> 14:55.645
Even an added bonus --
I got the M.E. report.

14:55.765 --> 14:57.218
Wonderful.

14:58.017 --> 15:01.520
I do a lot of things for you. You want me
to keep doing them, you got to protect me.

15:01.521 --> 15:04.240
- You got to take these guys out.
- So I'm working for you now?

15:04.360 --> 15:06.625
It's either them or me.

15:07.827 --> 15:10.950
Lots of crooked cops
in this town, Lionel.

15:11.288 --> 15:14.463
It's not gonna be hard to find another
one just as useful as you...

15:14.583 --> 15:16.553
with less baggage.

15:17.815 --> 15:19.638
The report, please.

15:20.261 --> 15:22.611
I did say "please."

15:25.581 --> 15:28.935
That's the spirit.

15:36.519 --> 15:39.545
Finch, I know why the
doctor's stalking Benton.

15:39.546 --> 15:42.648
In '96, when Benton was a senior
at N.Y.U.,

15:42.649 --> 15:46.788
he sexually assaulted a freshman girl
at a fraternity rush party.

15:46.908 --> 15:51.379
Uh, she said in her statement
that she wanted to impress him.

15:51.499 --> 15:54.079
He -- he was popular,
a star athlete.

15:54.199 --> 15:58.334
So she had a couple beers with him, claimed
he slipped something in her drink.

15:58.454 --> 16:00.704
Why wasn't he arrested?

16:02.103 --> 16:05.305
She waited two days
to report the assault.

16:05.307 --> 16:07.340
Probably ashamed, scared.

16:07.342 --> 16:11.678
Tox reports came back clean.
Rape kit was inconclusive.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.380
She dropped the charges.

16:13.382 --> 16:15.148
Who was the girl?

16:17.251 --> 16:19.886
Gabrielle Tillman,
the doctor's sister.

16:19.888 --> 16:23.022
A year after the attack,
Gabrielle was rushed to the E.R.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.324
and pronounced D.O.A.

16:24.326 --> 16:26.560
from an overdose
of antidepressants

16:26.562 --> 16:28.762
and sleeping pills.

16:28.764 --> 16:30.697
This isn't
an accidental overdose.

16:30.699 --> 16:33.700
This is--

16:33.702 --> 16:35.335
She committed suicide.

16:35.337 --> 16:39.507
And that's why the machine
gave us Tillman's number.

16:39.509 --> 16:41.141
She's going to murder Benton.

16:41.143 --> 16:44.612
The man responsible
for her sister's death.

16:44.614 --> 16:47.582
Correct.

16:48.751 --> 16:52.553
Finch, she's a doctor
who saves lives.

16:52.555 --> 16:55.623
She doesn't know what it's like
to take one.

16:57.258 --> 16:59.726
It'll destroy her.

17:07.867 --> 17:09.568
Mr. Burdett?
Detective Carter.

17:09.569 --> 17:11.837
I called regarding
the robbery you witnessed.

17:11.839 --> 17:14.638
Uh, can I come in?

17:14.641 --> 17:17.541
I've been expecting you.

17:21.180 --> 17:24.115
Sorry about the mess.

17:24.117 --> 17:25.282
Paralegal, right?

17:25.285 --> 17:28.453
At lockup looking into a case?

17:28.454 --> 17:30.855
Probate court failed to require

17:30.857 --> 17:33.058
a fidelity bond
of the executor.

17:33.060 --> 17:36.528
The executor, in his turn,

17:36.530 --> 17:39.497
robbed the Ulman estate blind.

17:39.499 --> 17:42.233
- Please sit.
- Oh, thank you.

17:42.235 --> 17:45.503
Were you injured
during the robbery?

17:46.639 --> 17:49.273
Don't worry.
I'm not gonna sue the city.

17:49.275 --> 17:51.341
This is an old injury,

17:51.343 --> 17:54.945
although the stress
of the situation did not help.

17:54.947 --> 17:58.716
We're doing everything in
our power to catch these guys.

17:58.718 --> 18:03.287
Mr. Burdett, do you mind walking
me through what happened?

18:03.289 --> 18:05.555
I was standing at the counter
at lockup.

18:05.557 --> 18:08.591
They came storming in.
They had guns.

18:08.593 --> 18:12.061
They were shouting at us
to get down on the floor, so...

18:12.063 --> 18:13.463
I did.

18:13.465 --> 18:14.697
During the robbery,

18:14.699 --> 18:18.968
did you hear any of the men
say the name "Elias"?

18:18.970 --> 18:20.764
I don't believe so.
Who's Elias?

18:21.422 --> 18:23.271
Did you get a look at
any of their faces?

18:23.391 --> 18:24.834
No.

18:24.954 --> 18:27.159
Did any of the men talk to you?

18:27.160 --> 18:29.421
Not that I recall.

18:32.874 --> 18:39.253
Because it looks to me...
like this man said something to you.

18:47.643 --> 18:50.894
Oh, I was hoping I wouldn't have
to go through all of this again.

18:52.083 --> 18:53.350
Yes.

18:54.073 --> 18:57.017
He told me to stop
staring at him.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.820
That's interesting.

18:59.943 --> 19:02.132
Most people's instinct
is to look away.

19:03.147 --> 19:05.941
Well, I've never been accused
of being like most people.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.229
Did he say anything else to you?

19:07.885 --> 19:09.064
No.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.373
Did you try to communicate
with him in any other way?

19:11.493 --> 19:12.260
How do you mean?

19:12.380 --> 19:14.911
When he was holding
you by your jacket.

19:15.564 --> 19:17.780
I asked him to let me go.

19:19.340 --> 19:21.614
And that's all you said?

19:22.044 --> 19:24.251
Detective Carter, I suppose
you're used to being around

19:24.371 --> 19:27.821
guns, I suppose scenes of
violence are commonplace for you,

19:27.941 --> 19:31.897
but I can assure you that
for me, it was terrifying.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.236
I was so terrified, I
couldn't even look away.

19:35.356 --> 19:39.486
So, when he picked me up, I thought
surely I was about to die.

19:39.964 --> 19:42.471
So, yes, I was
communicating with him.

19:42.591 --> 19:44.127
I was begging for my life.

19:46.283 --> 19:49.187
I'm sorry I can't remember
the exact words I used.

19:53.625 --> 19:58.651
Well... if you can think of anything
else, please give me a call.

20:00.085 --> 20:03.965
I promise you, we
will catch this guy.

20:15.181 --> 20:18.049
Hi.

20:20.253 --> 20:22.153
Where's Tillman,
Mr. Reese?

20:22.155 --> 20:23.487
She's working.

20:23.489 --> 20:27.290
I'm taking care
of a little side project.

20:27.292 --> 20:29.392
What's got you worried, Harold?

20:29.394 --> 20:30.560
Detective Carter.

20:30.562 --> 20:32.095
I met with her
about the robbery.

20:32.097 --> 20:34.564
I had to know what she knows.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.799
She's motivated.

20:36.801 --> 20:38.467
Some might say "fixated."

20:38.469 --> 20:39.768
It won't be long

20:39.770 --> 20:41.404
before she catches up to you.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.406
Gonna have to have a plan
when she does.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.873
I'm taking care of it.

20:44.875 --> 20:47.175
I'm making a new friend
on the police force.

20:47.177 --> 20:49.077
He's going to help us
with our problem

20:49.079 --> 20:51.580
with Carter and Fusco.

20:51.582 --> 20:53.348
Tillman's off in 20 minutes.

20:53.350 --> 20:54.816
Got to go.

20:54.818 --> 20:57.753
After the bar,
we went back to his place.

20:57.755 --> 21:02.024
He slipped something
in my drink.

21:03.527 --> 21:06.796
I blacked out.

21:07.731 --> 21:09.498
When I...

21:09.500 --> 21:13.235
woke up, I was in his bed,
facedown, naked.

21:13.237 --> 21:15.036
I couldn't find my dress.

21:16.106 --> 21:18.873
I wanted to scream,

21:18.875 --> 21:20.908
to call the cops,

21:20.910 --> 21:24.111
someone, anyone,

21:24.113 --> 21:27.647
but I was afraid.

21:27.649 --> 21:31.285
I was crying when I left.

21:31.287 --> 21:35.956
He just smiled and said
I was a real wild woman,

21:35.958 --> 21:39.828
and he would see me at work.

21:39.830 --> 21:44.533
Now every day I see him,
and he smiles that same smile,

21:44.535 --> 21:46.368
and I want to throw up.

21:48.438 --> 21:50.706
I need this job.
I can't quit.

21:54.044 --> 21:56.844
I never talk
at these things either.

21:56.846 --> 21:58.479
- Excuse me?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

21:58.481 --> 22:01.381
I didn't mean to interrupt.
I...

22:01.383 --> 22:04.017
just wanted some coffee.

22:04.019 --> 22:06.353
Sorry.

22:06.355 --> 22:10.691
Don't be.
It's my third cup today.

22:10.693 --> 22:13.126
You know, I keep coming to these
things, hoping I'll feel better,

22:13.128 --> 22:15.295
but they only make me
feel worse.

22:15.297 --> 22:17.064
This coffee's terrible.

22:18.334 --> 22:22.737
Uh, that woman in there--
y-you know her?

22:22.739 --> 22:24.005
No.

22:24.007 --> 22:27.942
But, uh, I know someone
like her.

22:31.347 --> 22:33.315
- What about you?
- Hmm?

22:33.317 --> 22:35.450
Why are you here?

22:35.452 --> 22:37.886
I lost someone
very close to me.

22:41.323 --> 22:43.357
I'm sorry.

22:43.359 --> 22:45.258
Not a day goes by I don't think

22:45.260 --> 22:47.761
about what I could've done.

22:50.431 --> 22:53.732
Yeah.

22:53.734 --> 22:56.635
It took me years

22:56.637 --> 23:00.940
to piece together
what happened to my friend.

23:00.942 --> 23:03.676
You know, I thought I could...

23:03.678 --> 23:05.677
live with it.

23:05.679 --> 23:07.145
I put it behind me.

23:07.147 --> 23:09.147
I had a good job,

23:09.149 --> 23:11.883
a good life.

23:13.419 --> 23:16.721
And then I saw him a month ago.

23:16.723 --> 23:19.357
And it all came back.

23:19.359 --> 23:21.692
He was eating dinner

23:21.694 --> 23:23.861
at this little French place
in my neighborhood.

23:23.863 --> 23:26.296
He was out on a date.

23:26.298 --> 23:30.000
He looked content.

23:30.002 --> 23:34.305
My world is shattered,
and he looks content.

23:35.475 --> 23:36.875
Sorry.

23:36.877 --> 23:38.610
I don't know why
I'm telling you all this.

23:38.612 --> 23:41.346
Hey, everybody needs
someone to talk to.

23:41.348 --> 23:43.581
I'm John.

23:45.251 --> 23:49.788
I'm Kate.
Kate Leman.

23:51.624 --> 23:55.293
The photos are some kind
of sick trophies of his victims.

23:55.295 --> 23:58.363
Benton convinces these women
to do coke with him,

23:58.365 --> 24:02.501
slips them a sedative,
then rapes them.

24:02.503 --> 24:04.870
In the morning, they're
too afraid to come forward

24:04.872 --> 24:08.007
and implicate themselves.

24:08.009 --> 24:09.575
I suppose that explains

24:09.577 --> 24:11.844
why the charges against him
are consistently dropped.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.180
The guy's depraved...

24:15.182 --> 24:19.784
Gets off on violating
and humiliating all these women.

24:19.786 --> 24:22.520
He's not gonna stop, Finch.

24:22.522 --> 24:24.655
Did you get a hit on that name
the doctor gave me?

24:24.657 --> 24:26.857
We got three hits
on Kate Leman--

24:26.859 --> 24:29.160
the same pseudonym
she gave to Benton.

24:29.162 --> 24:32.430
The first is an 80-year-old
woman living in the Bronx.

24:32.432 --> 24:33.597
The second is living upstate

24:33.599 --> 24:35.532
at a woman's
corrections facility.

24:35.534 --> 24:38.401
The third has a P.O. box

24:38.403 --> 24:41.137
a block
from Tillman's hospital.

24:41.139 --> 24:45.175
She recently signed
rental agreements for a van

24:45.177 --> 24:48.579
and a vacation home in Montauk.

25:08.967 --> 25:10.466
You find the house?

25:10.468 --> 25:12.234
And then some.

25:12.236 --> 25:16.639
Doctor has everything she needs
to erase Benton for good.

25:16.641 --> 25:17.807
What do you mean "erase?"

25:17.809 --> 25:21.245
8 pounds of lye,
heated to 300 degrees--

25:21.247 --> 25:23.781
body will dissolve
in three hours,

25:23.783 --> 25:25.817
give or take.

25:25.819 --> 25:28.720
I will refrain from asking
how you know that.

25:28.722 --> 25:33.091
Oh, Finch,
she's meticulous--

25:33.093 --> 25:36.594
planned everything to a "t,"

25:36.596 --> 25:38.395
and she's gonna get away
with it.

25:38.397 --> 25:39.763
I'm beginning to wonder

25:39.765 --> 25:41.731
if maybe she's not doing
the world a favor.

25:41.733 --> 25:43.066
But Tillman isn't a killer.

25:43.068 --> 25:46.235
She goes through with it,
it'll ruin her life.

25:46.237 --> 25:48.604
What do you suggest,
Mr. Reese?

25:48.606 --> 25:50.806
We don't give her the chance.

25:50.808 --> 25:53.343
I'm gonna find a way
to make Benton disappear.

26:07.077 --> 26:08.344
Decided to help me?

26:08.346 --> 26:11.347
I'm not so easy
to replace, huh?

26:11.349 --> 26:14.183
I'm warning you, these cartel
guys will put two in your back,

26:14.185 --> 26:16.601
so don't leave
any of them standing.

26:16.721 --> 26:18.453
You need me here--
you sure you don't want me

26:18.455 --> 26:19.988
to go around back
and cover the exits?

26:19.990 --> 26:22.457
No, you're good right here.

26:26.731 --> 26:28.164
Detective?

26:28.166 --> 26:30.266
You got our money?

26:33.271 --> 26:35.072
<i>Orale, guey.</i>

26:37.375 --> 26:41.319
<i>Go-o-o-l!</i>

26:50.103 --> 26:53.224
You're supposed to
take them out.

26:56.428 --> 26:59.231
Hey, what are you doing?
You stealing from them?

26:59.233 --> 27:03.002
If it makes you feel better,
it's for a good cause.

27:12.046 --> 27:13.313
Sir, pardon me.

27:15.950 --> 27:17.718
What's the problem?

27:17.720 --> 27:19.453
No problem.

27:40.238 --> 27:42.806
Sir, can you hear me?

27:52.818 --> 27:55.120
I'm telling you,
this has been the craziest week.

27:55.122 --> 27:57.422
Drinks are on me.

27:57.424 --> 27:59.525
He's being released.

27:59.527 --> 28:00.826
Why?

28:00.828 --> 28:02.194
Look at the guy.
He's got four lawyers.

28:02.196 --> 28:03.329
Each of them got a suit on

28:03.331 --> 28:04.897
that costs more than I make
in six months--

28:04.899 --> 28:06.432
the kind of lawyers
that know every loophole

28:06.434 --> 28:09.902
a piece of garbage like Benton
can crawl through.

28:09.904 --> 28:12.171
What about the Toreros?

28:12.173 --> 28:14.807
They're gonna come
looking for me and their coke.

28:14.809 --> 28:18.876
Well, we better make sure
they don't find you, Lionel.

28:18.878 --> 28:22.046
You know what kind of hole
you got me into?

28:22.048 --> 28:23.781
What's stopping me right now
from making some noise,

28:23.783 --> 28:25.016
getting you arrested?

28:25.018 --> 28:28.153
I don't know.
What's stopping you?

28:38.098 --> 28:40.066
It's me.

28:40.068 --> 28:41.735
I know it's late.

28:41.737 --> 28:43.570
It was my fault.

28:43.572 --> 28:45.238
I know that now.

28:45.240 --> 28:49.342
I tried to put it
out of my head, but I can't.

28:50.877 --> 28:54.013
I'm sorry, Meg.

28:54.015 --> 28:57.650
I should've been
a better sister.

28:57.652 --> 28:59.652
Please...

28:59.654 --> 29:01.653
Just forget I called.

29:01.655 --> 29:03.989
Forget all this.

29:13.233 --> 29:16.768
Reese,
Dr. Tillman's on the move.

29:16.770 --> 29:18.370
I thought she was
in the middle of a shift.

29:18.372 --> 29:19.437
She was.

29:19.439 --> 29:21.639
She went to take a nap
and told the nurse

29:21.641 --> 29:23.241
not to wake her.

29:23.243 --> 29:26.645
Now she's moving away
from the hospital.

29:26.647 --> 29:27.546
I'm on it.

29:27.548 --> 29:29.215
Whatever you do, do it quick.

29:29.217 --> 29:31.050
She's headed
toward Benton's loft.

29:31.052 --> 29:33.319
All right, got it.

29:36.757 --> 29:39.560
Can we do this later, fellas?
I'm a little bus--

29:47.168 --> 29:49.570
What the hell?

30:40.954 --> 30:43.856
Reese, the doctor's been at
Benton's loft for five minutes.

30:43.858 --> 30:45.658
Where the hell are you?

30:53.566 --> 30:55.500
Oh.

30:55.502 --> 30:58.769
Nice to see you again, Lionel.

30:58.771 --> 31:02.072
Detective Fusco
owes us a debt...

31:02.074 --> 31:04.061
So he made
a little down payment--

31:04.181 --> 31:05.950
You.

31:06.070 --> 31:07.781
It's a win-win.

31:45.979 --> 31:48.729
Where's our cocaine?

31:51.633 --> 31:54.402
I know you.

31:54.404 --> 31:57.305
Then you know
if you cross the Torero cartel,

31:57.307 --> 31:58.973
you lose your head.

31:58.975 --> 32:00.045
I'm sorry.

32:00.165 --> 32:02.644
It's too late
to apologize, <i>amigo.</i>

32:02.646 --> 32:06.113
No, I'm sorry...

32:06.115 --> 32:08.811
But you're gonna lose
your head...

32:23.097 --> 32:24.297
Is this true?

32:24.299 --> 32:25.932
Shut up.

32:25.934 --> 32:27.634
How does he know about Miguel?

32:27.636 --> 32:29.335
Shut up.
He's lying.

32:57.098 --> 32:58.832
Look, it was nothing personal,
all right?

32:58.834 --> 33:00.567
I had no choice.
They were gonna kill me.

33:00.569 --> 33:05.504
I told you, you're not
the only dirty cop in town.

33:05.506 --> 33:07.940
I called in a favor.

33:07.942 --> 33:09.808
It's time
for a change of scenery.

33:09.810 --> 33:12.811
You're gonna be doing
something else for me.

33:12.813 --> 33:15.013
And, Lionel...

33:15.015 --> 33:18.016
Don't do this again.

33:43.508 --> 33:45.242
Officer.

33:45.244 --> 33:46.944
- Uh, $20 on 2, please.
- Sure.

33:46.946 --> 33:48.412
Thanks.

33:48.414 --> 33:49.880
I thought that was you.

33:49.882 --> 33:51.982
Remember me?

33:51.984 --> 33:55.118
Oh!
The guy from the support group.

33:56.321 --> 33:58.689
Yeah.

33:58.691 --> 34:00.457
Well, I got to go.

34:00.459 --> 34:03.827
Let me buy you
a cup of coffee, Megan.

34:05.496 --> 34:08.965
Come on, I hear it's terrible.

34:08.967 --> 34:13.370
The guy you got tied up
in the back of the van can wait.

34:28.452 --> 34:31.121
You're smart.

34:31.123 --> 34:34.757
And you've been careful.

34:34.760 --> 34:37.527
You probably
wouldn't get caught.

34:39.563 --> 34:43.467
But the truth is, you'll never
really get away with it.

34:47.838 --> 34:51.674
Do you know who he is...

34:51.676 --> 34:53.141
What he's done?

34:53.143 --> 34:55.511
I know all about Andrew Benton.

34:55.513 --> 34:58.647
I know all about you, Megan.

34:58.649 --> 35:02.752
I know
you're a damn good doctor.

35:02.754 --> 35:06.488
I know that you've spent years
of your life

35:06.490 --> 35:10.124
healing people.

35:10.126 --> 35:13.795
And I know if you do this...

35:13.797 --> 35:17.331
if you murder this man
in cold blood...

35:19.334 --> 35:21.301
it will kill you.

35:23.304 --> 35:27.975
You told me
that you lost someone.

35:27.977 --> 35:29.777
Was that true?

35:32.047 --> 35:36.618
How can you sit there
and tell me not to do something

35:36.620 --> 35:39.454
you know in your heart
you would do, too?

35:39.456 --> 35:42.324
Because unlike you...

35:42.326 --> 35:46.027
I know what happens
when you take a life.

35:46.029 --> 35:49.296
You lose a part of yourself...

35:49.298 --> 35:51.798
Not everything...

35:53.567 --> 35:57.469
Just the part
that matters the most.

35:58.304 --> 36:00.305
Is that what happened to you?

36:05.144 --> 36:07.880
You don't have to do this.

36:07.882 --> 36:11.985
You can turn around right now.

36:11.987 --> 36:13.153
Mm-mm.

36:13.155 --> 36:16.023
He's seen me.
He's seen my face.

36:19.228 --> 36:23.298
Well, suppose
I have a little talk with him.

36:23.300 --> 36:26.401
Trust me, it won't matter.

36:28.270 --> 36:32.540
Give me the keys
to your van, Megan.

36:32.542 --> 36:34.075
Everything he's done,

36:34.077 --> 36:37.611
and I'm supposed to just
hand you over the keys?

36:37.613 --> 36:39.614
He gets to walk free?

36:39.616 --> 36:42.450
What do I get?

36:42.452 --> 36:44.318
You get a second chance.

36:44.320 --> 36:46.955
You get to let go.

36:48.457 --> 36:52.594
You get your life back.

36:52.596 --> 36:55.698
What does Gabrielle get?

36:55.700 --> 36:58.935
She gets to keep
her memory of you.

37:06.176 --> 37:07.977
I don't get it.

37:07.979 --> 37:09.946
Who are you?
Why are you here?

37:09.948 --> 37:13.149
I already told you.

37:13.151 --> 37:16.185
Everybody needs someone
to talk to.

37:28.965 --> 37:31.166
Thank you.

37:34.004 --> 37:36.238
Reese?

37:36.240 --> 37:38.207
Where's Dr. Tillman?

37:38.209 --> 37:40.142
She's fine.

37:40.144 --> 37:42.078
I have her van...

37:42.080 --> 37:43.679
and Benton.

37:46.916 --> 37:48.884
What are you gonna do with him?

37:48.886 --> 37:52.086
We're gonna have a little talk.

37:54.590 --> 37:57.224
Why do you do it, Finch--

37:57.226 --> 38:00.761
the machine, the numbers,
all of it?

38:00.763 --> 38:03.964
I told you, Mr. Reese...

38:05.901 --> 38:08.035
I have my reasons.

38:11.140 --> 38:15.911
And our little problem
with detective Carter?

38:15.913 --> 38:18.947
Taken care of.

38:27.056 --> 38:28.623
Detective.

38:28.625 --> 38:30.158
Captain,
it's a real pleasure--

38:30.160 --> 38:31.526
Save it.

38:31.528 --> 38:33.795
I was told to assign you to
this desk and not ask questions.

38:33.797 --> 38:37.164
So this is me
not asking questions.

38:37.166 --> 38:38.999
And this is you
calling your friend

38:39.001 --> 38:42.001
and telling him to lose
the photos he's got of me.

38:42.003 --> 38:43.469
But if you mess up,

38:43.471 --> 38:45.371
I really don't care
who's watching out for you.

38:45.373 --> 38:48.207
I will personally see
that your ass fries.

38:50.210 --> 38:53.112
Have a great day, detective.

39:00.221 --> 39:03.256
- Cute kid.
- Thanks.

39:06.961 --> 39:10.263
What's that--the center street
lockup robbery?

39:10.265 --> 39:11.731
That was something.

39:11.733 --> 39:15.202
- Any leads?
- A few.

39:15.204 --> 39:18.172
- You just transfer?
- Yeah.

39:18.174 --> 39:19.373
Detective Fusco.

39:19.375 --> 39:21.742
Carter.

39:21.744 --> 39:23.477
Looks like
you're stuck with me.

39:23.479 --> 39:25.178
Hmm.

39:41.726 --> 39:42.726
Where am I?

39:45.698 --> 39:49.134
That woman in my loft--
she...

39:49.136 --> 39:51.403
tased me.

39:51.405 --> 39:54.306
Don't worry.
I told her to leave.

39:54.308 --> 39:57.310
She isn't cut out for this.

39:57.312 --> 40:00.948
She fixes people...

40:00.950 --> 40:03.417
Not like us.

40:03.419 --> 40:06.353
We break them.

40:09.824 --> 40:13.894
I don't understand.
Um, who are you?

40:17.765 --> 40:20.367
What are you gonna do to me?

40:20.369 --> 40:22.702
Honestly,
I haven't decided yet.

40:25.172 --> 40:29.108
Let me ask you a question.

40:29.110 --> 40:31.977
Do you think people
ever really change?

40:31.979 --> 40:35.313
I mean, you--
you hurt innocent people,

40:35.315 --> 40:38.215
and I--
well...

40:38.217 --> 40:41.852
For a long time,
I killed people like you.

40:41.854 --> 40:46.590
Please,
I'm not who you think I am.

40:46.592 --> 40:48.993
This is a mistake.

40:48.995 --> 40:52.530
Wait--wait, o-o-okay.

40:56.835 --> 40:59.136
I've done some things.
Um...

40:59.138 --> 41:02.406
I've crossed some lines.

41:02.408 --> 41:03.907
But I won't do it again.

41:03.909 --> 41:07.678
I-I swear.

41:07.680 --> 41:09.580
Please...

41:09.582 --> 41:11.382
Let me go.

41:13.952 --> 41:15.720
I could let you go,

41:15.722 --> 41:19.324
'cause you know
for the rest of your life

41:19.326 --> 41:22.094
that I'd be watching you.

41:22.096 --> 41:25.364
And if you hurt anybody...

41:25.366 --> 41:27.866
I'd stop you.

41:27.868 --> 41:30.602
Maybe you could change.

41:30.604 --> 41:33.637
And maybe so could I.

41:37.709 --> 41:41.211
But the truth is...

41:41.213 --> 41:44.147
People don't really change,
do they?

41:45.916 --> 41:48.852
No, they, uh--
they can.

41:48.854 --> 41:50.754
I can.

41:50.756 --> 41:52.990
And, um, you--

41:52.992 --> 41:55.426
I--

41:55.428 --> 41:59.730
I don't think
that you're going to kill me.

41:59.732 --> 42:03.033
- No?
- No, because...

42:03.035 --> 42:06.269
I can see, inside,
that you're a--

42:06.271 --> 42:07.337
a good person.

42:07.339 --> 42:09.739
You're a good man.

42:09.741 --> 42:13.175
Good?

42:13.177 --> 42:17.312
I lost that part of myself
a long time ago.

42:19.248 --> 42:22.417
I'm not sure if I can find it.

42:25.121 --> 42:28.658
I'm not sure
it matters anymore.

42:28.660 --> 42:31.160
Maybe it's better this way.

42:31.162 --> 42:34.397
Maybe it's up to me to do
what the good people can't.

42:34.399 --> 42:37.167
Or maybe there
are no good people.

42:37.169 --> 42:40.704
Maybe there
are only good decisions.

42:40.706 --> 42:42.540
Please...

42:42.542 --> 42:44.108
You--

42:44.110 --> 42:46.643
y-you don't want to do something
that you're gonna regret.

42:46.645 --> 42:50.381
Which do you think
I'll regret more--

42:50.383 --> 42:52.216
letting you live

42:52.218 --> 42:55.352
or letting you die?

42:55.354 --> 42:57.788
Andrew...

42:57.790 --> 43:00.991
Help me make a good decision.
