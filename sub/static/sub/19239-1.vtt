02:08.461 --> 02:11.330
- I am stretched on your grave

02:11.332 --> 02:13.532
and I'll lie there forever

02:14.434 --> 02:17.336
if your hands were in mine

02:17.338 --> 02:20.139
I'd be sure they could not sever

02:20.840 --> 02:23.375
my apple tree, my brightness

02:24.444 --> 02:27.146
it's time we were together

02:27.148 --> 02:29.515
for I smell of the earth

02:29.517 --> 02:31.717
and am worn by the weather

02:33.286 --> 02:34.786
when my family thinks

02:34.788 --> 02:37.656
that I'm safely in my bed

02:37.658 --> 02:39.491
from morn until night

02:39.493 --> 02:42.161
I am stretched out at your head

02:42.163 --> 02:43.896
calling out to the earth

02:43.898 --> 02:45.898
with tears hot and wild

02:46.733 --> 02:48.901
my grief for the girl

02:48.903 --> 02:50.903
that I loved as a child

02:51.938 --> 02:52.838
do you remember

02:52.840 --> 02:54.673
the night we were lost

02:54.675 --> 02:56.808
in the shade of the blackthorn

02:56.810 --> 02:59.545
and the chill of the frost

02:59.547 --> 03:02.281
so I'm stretched on your grave

03:02.283 --> 03:04.349
and will lie there forever

03:04.351 --> 03:06.251
if your hands were in mine

03:06.253 --> 03:08.854
I'd be sure they could not sever

03:09.956 --> 03:12.491
my apple tree, my brightness

03:13.526 --> 03:15.727
it's time we were together

03:16.796 --> 03:19.331
for I smell of the earth

03:19.333 --> 03:21.533
and am worn by the weather

03:42.956 --> 03:45.490
my apple tree, my brightness

03:49.929 --> 03:52.331
it's time we were together

03:53.233 --> 03:55.300
for I smell of the earth

03:56.936 --> 03:59.338
and am worn by the weather

04:24.397 --> 04:27.366
- um, maybe right down there?

04:27.368 --> 04:28.033
- Yeah.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.035
- Okay.

04:41.447 --> 04:42.581
I'm so sorry.

04:43.916 --> 04:45.684
- Shannon, thanks for coming.

04:45.686 --> 04:46.551
- You okay?

04:46.553 --> 04:49.021
- Ah, hanging in there.

04:49.023 --> 04:51.723
Sam, good to see you again.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.458
- I'm sorry, Aiden.

04:54.527 --> 04:56.295
- And look at this one here.

04:56.297 --> 04:58.664
A man before my eyes.

04:58.666 --> 05:02.968
She'd be pleased to
know that you were here.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.736
- You must be Liam.

05:04.738 --> 05:07.506
I hear you're quite the Irish
dancer.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.708
- Yeah, i guess so.

05:09.710 --> 05:10.575
- I'm Sam.

05:10.577 --> 05:11.677
This is my wife Shannon.

05:11.679 --> 05:12.544
- Of course!

05:12.546 --> 05:13.578
Maggie's daughter.

05:13.580 --> 05:15.614
Aiden told me so much about you.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.382
- Is it okay if I take this down
there?

05:17.384 --> 05:19.785
- Of course, please.

05:34.033 --> 05:37.035
- Hey, there's grandma and
grandpa.

05:41.674 --> 05:43.975
- Thank you for coming.

05:43.977 --> 05:45.911
- Aiden, I'm sorry for your
loss.

05:45.913 --> 05:47.112
If there's anything we can do.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.780
- John, thank you.

05:50.750 --> 05:52.718
Thanks for coming, Maureen.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.753
Thanks for making the trip down.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.088
I appreciate it.

05:57.123 --> 05:58.957
- And where should we sit,
sweetie?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.692
- Why not just join Sam.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.827
He's right up front.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.028
- Okay.

06:10.136 --> 06:11.536
- Can I talk to you?

06:11.538 --> 06:13.071
- Is everything all right?

06:13.073 --> 06:15.140
- Yeah, I just want to
talk to you for a minute.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.742
- Okay.

06:29.021 --> 06:33.825
You know, I fell in love
many times in my life.

06:33.827 --> 06:37.829
Trouble was, it was always
with the same woman.

06:38.698 --> 06:41.800
- I know you loved her, Aiden.

06:41.802 --> 06:44.503
- That wonderful, wicked woman.

06:45.638 --> 06:47.939
- I'm so sorry.

06:47.941 --> 06:52.144
- Shannon, I know I'm only your
stepfather

06:52.146 --> 06:54.746
and really have no right to ask
you,

06:54.748 --> 06:57.749
but will you please say a few
words

06:59.452 --> 07:01.052
to honor your mother?

07:01.054 --> 07:03.722
- Oh, I don't think I'm
the right person for that.

07:03.724 --> 07:05.524
- Of course you are.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.994
- I have no idea what I would
say.

07:08.996 --> 07:13.665
- It would mean the
world to me if you'd try.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.869
Shannon, I can't go up there
and talk about her right now.

07:20.840 --> 07:24.943
I'm asking you, please,
would you do this for me?

07:25.778 --> 07:27.746
- Sure, okay, yeah.

07:27.748 --> 07:30.048
I'll say something, yeah.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.783
I'll say something.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.562
- Liam, please put the phone
away.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.571
What was that all about?

07:52.573 --> 07:54.105
Is everything okay?

07:54.907 --> 07:58.477
- He wants me to say a few
words.

07:58.479 --> 08:00.912
- Are you okay with that?

08:00.914 --> 08:01.914
- Yeah.

08:20.633 --> 08:22.634
- Welcome to all on this blessed
day

08:22.636 --> 08:25.904
as a child of god returns
to the kingdom of heaven.

08:25.906 --> 08:28.707
Before proceeding to the
cemetery for the burial service,

08:28.709 --> 08:31.643
Maggie's daughter Shannon
is now going to come up

08:31.645 --> 08:33.245
and say a few words.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.514
Shannon?

08:40.119 --> 08:42.053
- Did you know she was gonna
talk?

08:42.054 --> 08:42.921
- No.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.523
Didn't know that.

08:45.224 --> 08:48.093
- It's making me most
uncomfortable.

08:48.095 --> 08:50.228
- Let's just try to be
supportive, okay?

08:50.230 --> 08:51.730
- Oh, supportive.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.865
I think we're supportive
just by being in here.

08:53.867 --> 08:54.867
- Shh!

09:03.977 --> 09:08.179
Three irishmen were adrift
at sea, terribly thirsty.

09:09.315 --> 09:11.716
Suddenly a mermaid swims up and
says,

09:11.718 --> 09:14.653
"i shall Grant you one wish."

09:14.655 --> 09:16.888
Without thinking, one
of the irishmen says,

09:16.890 --> 09:18.890
"turn the sea to beer."

09:20.293 --> 09:22.661
The mermaid says, "let it be!"

09:22.663 --> 09:25.096
And the sea was turned to beer.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.799
Then one of the other
irishmen stands up and says,

09:27.801 --> 09:29.034
"shite!

09:29.036 --> 09:30.902
Where are we gonna piss?"

09:34.074 --> 09:35.874
For those of you who don't know
me,

09:35.876 --> 09:37.742
I am Shannon, Maggie's daughter.

09:37.744 --> 09:40.745
I was given up for adoption at
birth.

09:40.747 --> 09:44.950
I guess it was so I wouldn't
have to listen to her jokes.

09:45.818 --> 09:49.254
Funny thing is that i
didn't get to know Maggie

09:49.256 --> 09:51.122
until recently.

09:51.124 --> 09:52.257
Those of you who know her,

09:52.259 --> 09:54.926
you know how tough she was.

09:54.928 --> 09:55.928
Had to be.

09:57.029 --> 09:58.897
But what most of you might not
know

09:58.899 --> 10:01.099
is she was a great artist,

10:01.934 --> 10:03.868
an artist that was never
given the opportunity

10:03.870 --> 10:06.204
to pursue her passion.

10:06.206 --> 10:09.641
In addition to my blue eyes
and...

10:09.643 --> 10:12.243
God, her eyes, and my fair skin,

10:13.980 --> 10:15.714
I too am an artist.

10:17.249 --> 10:21.653
About a year ago i
decided to rent a place,

10:21.655 --> 10:23.188
send out invitations because i
was going

10:23.190 --> 10:25.657
to paint a family portrait.

10:26.392 --> 10:27.926
My whole family.

12:12.832 --> 12:13.898
- Hurry up!

12:13.900 --> 12:14.966
Let's go, c'mon.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.367
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

12:18.038 --> 12:19.170
C'mon, c'mon.

12:19.172 --> 12:20.305
Hurry up!

12:20.307 --> 12:21.307
Come on!

12:23.042 --> 12:24.042
Stop.

12:25.978 --> 12:28.980
After you.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.185
- Whoa!

12:36.088 --> 12:37.055
Oh my god!

12:37.057 --> 12:38.456
- Yeah.

12:44.063 --> 12:45.096
- Think it's big enough?

13:05.518 --> 13:06.985
Yeah, over here.

13:06.987 --> 13:09.087
- Mom, how did you find this
place?

13:09.089 --> 13:12.157
- Oh, a friend recommended it to
me.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.125
You'll appreciate this.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.995
I had the canvas delivered a few
days ago.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.930
- Yeah, what is with the canvas?

13:18.932 --> 13:21.232
- I wanted to paint the family,

13:21.234 --> 13:23.935
and get us together for a few
days,

13:23.937 --> 13:25.904
away from the house.

13:27.007 --> 13:27.939
- Cool.

13:27.941 --> 13:31.309
- Remember, take plenty
of photos this weekend.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.544
- Okay.

13:34.915 --> 13:35.814
Yeah, no problem.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.583
I'll just, ah, I'll do that.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.585
- You little!

13:55.501 --> 13:56.367
- C'mon, c'mon!

13:56.369 --> 13:57.569
- Oh, shut it!

13:59.605 --> 14:01.172
I'll get you.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.443
- Hey, I brought the bags in.

14:05.445 --> 14:05.443
How's the studio?

14:05.445 --> 14:08.913
Because it cannot be any
better than this kitchen

14:08.915 --> 14:11.616
and there is a smoker
and a barbecue out back.

14:11.618 --> 14:12.483
- It's perfect.

14:12.485 --> 14:13.351
What did I say?

14:13.353 --> 14:14.219
- You're right.

14:14.221 --> 14:15.086
- I love you.

14:15.088 --> 14:16.088
- I love you.

14:16.623 --> 14:17.856
- All right you.

14:20.460 --> 14:21.893
- Wait before you pull in here.

14:21.895 --> 14:25.029
- Oh just sh-sh-sh.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.564
I think this is it.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.234
What do you think?

14:29.236 --> 14:30.969
- Well...

14:32.171 --> 14:34.606
Yep, those are the longhorns on
the gate.

14:34.608 --> 14:34.606
- Uh-huh.

14:34.608 --> 14:38.009
- Yep, this is it.

14:39.178 --> 14:40.511
- Okay.

14:40.513 --> 14:41.579
This is nice.

14:41.581 --> 14:43.147
- A little rustic, huh?

14:43.149 --> 14:44.082
- Wow.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.550
- Daddy?

15:13.113 --> 15:14.312
- Your parents are here.

15:14.314 --> 15:18.383
- Yeah.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.252
They're here!

15:23.623 --> 15:25.990
Uh-oh, I can't miss.

15:25.992 --> 15:27.358
Oh!

15:27.360 --> 15:28.459
- Hey!

15:28.461 --> 15:30.028
- Oh, momma!

15:30.030 --> 15:31.195
- Well, we got the right place.

15:31.197 --> 15:33.031
- Yes you do.

15:33.033 --> 15:33.031
- It's so pretty.

15:33.033 --> 15:36.067
- Ooh, I'm so happy you're here!

15:36.069 --> 15:37.468
- Me too.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.336
- Oh!

15:38.338 --> 15:38.336
- Give me some!

15:38.338 --> 15:41.272
- Oh, you'll get some.

15:41.274 --> 15:43.675
- Good to see ya, kid!

15:43.677 --> 15:45.543
You look great.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.446
My god, look at you!

15:49.315 --> 15:51.649
Oh my god, you look amazing.

15:52.518 --> 15:54.252
I can't believe you did all
this.

15:54.254 --> 15:55.119
- Yeah, you proud?

15:55.121 --> 15:55.987
- Mmm, proud!

15:55.989 --> 15:56.654
- C'mon inside.

15:56.656 --> 15:56.654
- Okay!

15:56.656 --> 16:00.291
- Hey, Francis, good to see you!

16:00.293 --> 16:00.291
Hey, I got the list.

16:00.293 --> 16:00.291
We're gonna head out to the
store.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.294
Anybody need anything?

16:03.296 --> 16:03.294
- Yes!

16:03.296 --> 16:05.997
We need bottles of wine, vodka,
beer.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.498
- Wife's a lush!

16:07.500 --> 16:07.498
- Shut it.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.068
Oh, get something for dessert
too, please.

16:10.070 --> 16:10.735
- Ice cream?

16:10.737 --> 16:10.735
- Ah, see what they have.

16:10.737 --> 16:10.735
- All right, I'll leave it up to
Liam.

16:10.737 --> 16:15.540
We'll stop at the dairy
mart on the way there.

16:15.542 --> 16:16.574
- Mm-hmm!

16:16.576 --> 16:16.574
- All right.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.711
- If it's okay, I'm
gonna put you down here.

16:19.713 --> 16:21.679
That way you don't have to
deal with too many stairs.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.215
- Stairs don't bother me none.

16:24.217 --> 16:27.251
- He's wearing one of those
watches that records your steps.

16:27.253 --> 16:31.556
- Yeah, it counts my steps,
measures my heart rate,

16:31.558 --> 16:35.593
it even notifies me when my
subscription to playboy arrives!

16:36.463 --> 16:36.461
- Sh, sh, stop it.

16:36.463 --> 16:38.429
- He's in better shape than i
am.

16:38.431 --> 16:39.764
- Oh, don't say that.

16:39.766 --> 16:42.033
- I'll wake you for cocktails.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.035
- Okay.

16:43.769 --> 16:44.702
- All right.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.337
I'm putting you two upstairs.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.606
- Are there more stairs?

16:48.608 --> 16:50.475
- Oh!

16:50.477 --> 16:52.744
- What did you bring,

16:52.746 --> 16:54.746
your whole closet?!

16:54.748 --> 16:54.746
- Oh, this is great!

16:54.748 --> 16:57.682
You know, you could
have stuck us anywhere.

16:57.684 --> 16:59.350
- Oh, speak for yourself.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.652
- There's plenty of closet
space, a big balcony,

17:01.654 --> 17:04.088
private bathroom down the hall.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.758
- Oh!

17:06.760 --> 17:07.657
- Dad?

17:07.660 --> 17:09.260
- Uh-huh?

17:09.262 --> 17:10.262
What?

17:11.563 --> 17:12.563
Oh.

17:12.565 --> 17:13.531
- Look at that view.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.599
- Oh, that's perfect.

17:15.602 --> 17:16.602
Oh my god.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.238
But, honey, you gotta
stop worrying about us.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.140
- I couldn't figure out what to
wear,

17:22.142 --> 17:24.142
so I bought everything.

17:25.344 --> 17:27.145
Including the sheets.

17:27.146 --> 17:27.811
- Yeah.

17:27.814 --> 17:28.679
- You're kidding.

17:28.681 --> 17:29.747
- No, you've spoiled her.

17:29.749 --> 17:33.284
- Oh, I couldn't figure
out who slept on this bed.

17:33.286 --> 17:35.353
I mean, it could be
somebody who's been infected

17:35.355 --> 17:38.556
by some horrible rash
or lord knows what else.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.058
- Yeah, well...

17:40.060 --> 17:42.193
- Now, I have something
i want to show you.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.428
It's all my new clothes.

17:43.430 --> 17:45.696
- No, no, no, honey, just try
'em on

17:45.698 --> 17:47.065
in a little while.

17:47.067 --> 17:50.268
I want a moment with my
daughter.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.270
Mm-hmm.

17:55.108 --> 17:58.342
Now, you told us to
bring something special,

17:58.344 --> 17:59.844
right, something that
meant something to us?

17:59.846 --> 18:00.778
- Mm-hmm.

18:00.780 --> 18:03.681
- Have I ever showed this to
you?

18:03.683 --> 18:03.681
No?

18:03.683 --> 18:07.518
This is our family's scrapbook.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.821
It goes back many generations,

18:09.823 --> 18:11.722
all the way back to Ireland.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.259
Huh?

18:15.261 --> 18:17.595
Yeah, it's full of memories.

18:19.198 --> 18:22.667
And in the back, there's some
blank pages,

18:22.669 --> 18:25.603
ready for you to put some more
in.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.574
Oh, ah.

18:29.576 --> 18:32.510
Here, just flip through
it when you get a second.

18:32.512 --> 18:33.778
- It's perfect.

18:34.713 --> 18:35.880
I love you.

18:35.882 --> 18:37.482
- I love you too.

18:41.588 --> 18:42.520
Okay, honey!

18:42.522 --> 18:43.821
All yours!

18:43.823 --> 18:43.821
- Thank you!

18:43.823 --> 18:49.460
- I'm gonna
get a drink, all right?

18:50.596 --> 18:51.863
- Ah, you would be so proud of
me.

18:51.865 --> 18:53.798
I separated all my dresses.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.800
Party, daytime, formal.

18:57.669 --> 18:59.337
- What's in the other bag?

18:59.339 --> 19:00.471
- Shoes.

19:00.473 --> 19:01.672
- Oh.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.307
Of course.

19:03.309 --> 19:05.409
- All right, what do ya think?

19:05.411 --> 19:08.546
- Ah, it's...
- Unh-uh.

19:08.548 --> 19:09.847
- No?
- - Nuh-uh.

19:09.849 --> 19:09.847
- Okay.

19:09.849 --> 19:13.918
You know, before we left, i
treated myself to a manicure

19:13.920 --> 19:16.888
and a pedicure and some
highlights,

19:18.223 --> 19:20.658
and I don't even think
your father noticed.

19:20.660 --> 19:23.194
- Well, you look great, mom.

19:24.429 --> 19:25.496
That, great.

19:27.366 --> 19:29.333
- I'm glad you like it.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.769
'Cause I bought it for you.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.704
- You didn't have to do that.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.440
- Yes I did, 'cause I liked it.

19:37.776 --> 19:41.512
I looked at it in the store
and I just saw you in it.

19:41.514 --> 19:44.882
I thought, gosh, you'd just
look beautiful in that.

19:44.884 --> 19:48.186
You know, when you invited
everybody,

19:50.455 --> 19:52.590
you said on the invitation that
you wanted

19:52.592 --> 19:55.793
something personal, something
special?

19:56.695 --> 20:00.198
Something that would inspire
you, right?

20:00.200 --> 20:01.699
- Mm-hmm.

20:01.701 --> 20:04.902
- Well, your daddy brought
you the photo album,

20:04.904 --> 20:07.238
and I brought you this.

20:14.346 --> 20:15.446
It's seana's.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.384
- Yup, she made it for me

20:20.386 --> 20:22.520
when she knew I was going to be
a mother.

20:22.522 --> 20:25.923
You see the three stars,
that's her, that's me,

20:25.925 --> 20:27.391
and that's you.

20:28.894 --> 20:29.961
Three.

20:29.963 --> 20:32.964
- I can't take this.

20:32.966 --> 20:33.898
- What?

20:33.900 --> 20:34.899
Yes you can.

20:34.901 --> 20:36.234
- It's yours.

20:38.570 --> 20:42.273
- Shannon, you know
that I have always said

20:42.275 --> 20:44.542
flowers are for the living.

20:47.379 --> 20:48.512
That's yours.

20:53.018 --> 20:54.418
- Thanks, mom.

20:55.487 --> 20:56.954
- I love you.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.789
- Love you.

21:01.493 --> 21:02.360
- What is this?

21:02.362 --> 21:04.595
- Oh, a beer?

21:04.597 --> 21:06.864
- Yeah, absolutely.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.967
Love these tops.

21:09.969 --> 21:10.835
- Yeah.

21:10.837 --> 21:11.702
- Yeah.

21:11.704 --> 21:12.570
- Salut.

21:12.572 --> 21:13.738
- Salut.

21:13.740 --> 21:17.408
- Ah, that is good.

21:17.410 --> 21:19.477
I think we're just gonna order
some pizza.

21:19.479 --> 21:21.479
- Oh, well, that's fine with me.

21:21.481 --> 21:23.347
- All right, what kind ya want?

21:23.349 --> 21:24.582
- Well, anything but

21:24.584 --> 21:25.850
Canadian bacon.

21:26.652 --> 21:29.020
- I thought you liked bacon.

21:29.022 --> 21:29.020
- Oh, I love bacon,

21:29.022 --> 21:32.657
but Canadian bacon isn't bacon,
it's ham.

21:32.659 --> 21:34.825
It's Canadian ham, you know what
i mean?

21:34.827 --> 21:37.028
I don't know how they get
away with calling it bacon.

21:37.030 --> 21:38.030
It's ham!

21:39.364 --> 21:40.831
I'm gonna file an injunction.

21:40.833 --> 21:42.967
- All right, I'm with ya.

21:45.937 --> 21:49.006
- So how's my grandson doin'?

21:50.776 --> 21:53.878
- Hey.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.080
Hello!

21:56.082 --> 21:57.748
How's my grandson?

21:59.685 --> 22:00.551
- Doin' good, grandpa.

22:00.553 --> 22:02.320
Just stayin' busy.

22:02.322 --> 22:04.522
School, studyin', dancin'.

22:05.357 --> 22:07.024
Same ol', same ol'.

22:07.026 --> 22:08.826
- Well, there ya go.

22:11.363 --> 22:14.865
So how's the butcher
business, Dr. scalpel?

22:14.867 --> 22:16.100
- Same ol'.

22:17.870 --> 22:19.470
Oh, here they go.

22:20.405 --> 22:21.405
How cute.

22:22.074 --> 22:24.008
Did she end up with a unitard?

22:24.010 --> 22:26.510
- Ha, that'll clear a room.

22:27.380 --> 22:28.380
- Stop it.

22:29.614 --> 22:31.582
- We're just gonna order pizza.

22:31.584 --> 22:33.050
- You just went to the store.

22:34.454 --> 22:35.953
- I just thought that it would
be easier.

22:35.955 --> 22:35.953
- Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh-no.

22:35.955 --> 22:38.589
Once everyone's here, we're not
leaving.

22:38.591 --> 22:39.790
- Why don't you come on out and
show me

22:39.792 --> 22:43.060
where we're gonna have that
portrait, huh?

22:43.062 --> 22:45.996
- Check the lighting, honey.

22:45.998 --> 22:47.465
Whew.

22:47.467 --> 22:48.467
- Yeah.

22:51.103 --> 22:52.036
- Whoo.

22:52.038 --> 22:55.406
I don't think there's enough
whiskey in all of Ireland

22:55.408 --> 22:56.741
to get through this weekend.

22:56.743 --> 22:57.742
- Forget Ireland.

22:57.744 --> 22:59.410
Check the trunk of my car.

22:59.412 --> 23:00.478
- Thank you.

23:00.480 --> 23:04.415
- Bless me.

23:16.762 --> 23:18.562
- Oh, it is so beautiful.

23:18.564 --> 23:19.564
- Yeah.

23:21.466 --> 23:25.169
I thought the same thing the
first time I came out here.

23:25.171 --> 23:28.639
- You know who I think is the
most excited about being here?

23:28.641 --> 23:29.507
- Hm?

23:29.509 --> 23:30.841
- Your granddad.

23:32.077 --> 23:33.978
He rushed around the house
trying to find

23:33.980 --> 23:35.913
his captain's uniform.

23:37.783 --> 23:39.950
For the portrait, you know.

23:39.952 --> 23:40.851
Is that all right?

23:40.853 --> 23:44.054
- Absolutely.

23:44.056 --> 23:45.656
Is he doin' okay?

23:46.925 --> 23:47.792
- Yeah.

23:47.794 --> 23:49.794
He gets tired, you know,

23:49.796 --> 23:53.431
but he still wants to
be in complete control.

23:53.433 --> 23:54.799
He sat in the backseat of the
car

23:54.801 --> 23:59.003
and he was barking
directions all the way here.

23:59.005 --> 24:02.807
He is who he is.

24:06.545 --> 24:07.545
- Mom?

24:11.183 --> 24:12.917
About this weekend.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.054
- What is it, honey?

24:17.056 --> 24:18.456
- Hey, mom.

24:18.458 --> 24:20.825
Let me get a picture of you and
Nana.

24:22.562 --> 24:23.894
- You better get my best side,
you know.

24:23.896 --> 24:27.898
- All right, make sure that
those end up in my studio.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.033
- Yes, ma'am.

24:31.637 --> 24:33.003
- You know who would have loved
it here?

24:33.005 --> 24:34.572
- Hm?

24:34.574 --> 24:36.507
- Your grandma, seana.

24:41.646 --> 24:43.781
Oh, what a terrific lady.

24:45.951 --> 24:48.853
Complicated, dressed to the
nines,

24:50.088 --> 24:51.622
but very strict.

24:52.624 --> 24:53.824
Did I ever tell you about the
time

24:53.826 --> 24:56.060
I was in the bathroom,

24:56.062 --> 24:58.496
and she walked in on me,

24:58.498 --> 25:01.699
and she yelled at me
because I wasn't sitting up

25:01.701 --> 25:03.567
straight enough on the toilet?

25:07.239 --> 25:10.774
I guess that's how she tried to
love me.

25:15.847 --> 25:16.847
- I guess.

25:23.188 --> 25:25.656
- What's the matter, honey?

25:28.560 --> 25:29.560
What is it?

25:32.865 --> 25:33.931
Sometimes...

25:35.802 --> 25:36.701
- What?

25:36.702 --> 25:40.004
- I don't feel like I belong.

25:47.145 --> 25:49.213
- I don't think you should feel
that way.

25:49.215 --> 25:53.951
I mean, we're all here because
we're connected to you.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.019
We love you.

25:59.190 --> 26:02.593
Well, I don't know what to say
except,

26:05.897 --> 26:07.097
why don't we have a drink?

26:07.099 --> 26:09.166
What do ya say?

26:09.168 --> 26:10.301
For your grandma.

26:10.303 --> 26:11.569
We'll toast.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.040
- Hey, mom!

26:50.042 --> 26:51.042
- Oh, hey!

26:55.246 --> 26:56.714
- What are you doin'?

26:56.716 --> 26:59.316
- Setting up, getting organized.

27:00.285 --> 27:01.352
Whatcha got?

27:02.754 --> 27:02.753
- Remember how you asked
everybody

27:02.755 --> 27:05.289
to bring somethin'
special for the portrait?

27:05.291 --> 27:06.291
- Mm-hmm.

27:08.026 --> 27:11.028
Aww.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.030
Wow.

27:12.864 --> 27:13.998
- Remember?

27:14.000 --> 27:16.100
- Of course I do.

27:16.102 --> 27:19.336
It's the first show I ever took
you to.

27:19.338 --> 27:21.038
- It was great, wasn't it?

27:21.040 --> 27:22.040
- Mm-hmm.

27:25.176 --> 27:27.011
- I remember thinkin'
it would be so great

27:27.013 --> 27:29.013
to learn how to dance like that.

27:29.015 --> 27:33.183
- And now you do.

27:33.185 --> 27:33.183
Wow.

27:33.185 --> 27:35.653
- Oh, we took the pictures
with 'em too, remember?

27:35.655 --> 27:36.655
- Yeah!

27:37.222 --> 27:40.324
That really is a great night.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.159
Wonderful memory.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.227
Thank you.

27:43.229 --> 27:44.328
- Thanks, mom.

27:45.297 --> 27:46.964
All right, see ya.

27:48.333 --> 27:49.333
- See ya.

28:05.250 --> 28:06.383
- Hello, sweetie.

28:06.385 --> 28:07.251
Wine?

28:07.253 --> 28:08.118
- Absolutely.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.119
- All right.

28:09.121 --> 28:10.854
Liam, drink?

28:10.856 --> 28:12.122
- Beer me!

28:12.124 --> 28:14.224
- Yes, all right.

28:14.226 --> 28:15.759
- Beer me, what?

28:16.428 --> 28:18.062
- There ya go.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.129
There ya go!

28:21.800 --> 28:22.466
- Poor baby.

28:22.468 --> 28:23.734
- Sorry.

28:23.736 --> 28:24.768
- A nice try though.

28:24.770 --> 28:27.137
- I would have given you one.

28:28.441 --> 28:31.108
- You sit down and tell
me what you've been doin'.

28:31.110 --> 28:33.777
- Well, just getting organized.

28:33.779 --> 28:36.113
- Did you get our Liam's
present?

28:36.115 --> 28:38.082
- I did, and the album?

28:38.084 --> 28:39.249
It's amazing.

28:39.251 --> 28:39.249
- Yeah.

28:39.251 --> 28:42.052
Did your mother tell you
we're planning a cruise

28:42.054 --> 28:43.353
in the fall?

28:43.355 --> 28:45.422
- No, she didn't.

28:45.424 --> 28:45.422
- Her idea.

28:45.424 --> 28:48.859
- Ugh, he sounds really
excited, doesn't he?

28:48.861 --> 28:48.859
- Mm-hmm.

28:48.861 --> 28:51.862
- It's a small boat, about 200
people.

28:51.864 --> 28:54.231
We're goin' to Alaska
before global warming

28:54.233 --> 28:56.834
destroys all the polar bears.

28:57.769 --> 28:59.336
- Mom, you don't like cold
weather.

28:59.338 --> 29:01.405
- Oh, I know, but your
daddy's gonna buy me

29:01.407 --> 29:04.074
a beautiful jacket,
aren't you, daddy dear?

29:04.076 --> 29:05.342
- Well, that's why we're goin',

29:05.344 --> 29:07.411
so she can get a new jacket.

29:07.413 --> 29:07.411
- Sounds fun, grandma.

29:07.413 --> 29:10.447
- Yeah, well, you can come along
with us

29:10.449 --> 29:12.349
if you're not in school.

29:12.351 --> 29:14.218
- I can miss school to
go see polar bears die.

29:14.220 --> 29:15.219
- No, you can't.

29:15.221 --> 29:16.186
- Dad?

29:16.188 --> 29:18.288
- No, you can't.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.357
- Oh well, we'll work on him,
okay.

29:20.359 --> 29:22.226
See if we can work it, huh?

29:22.228 --> 29:23.794
- Mmm.

29:23.796 --> 29:25.262
- If he help us to go, he
can go.

29:25.264 --> 29:26.330
- All right, stop.

29:27.266 --> 29:28.265
I wanna find out something.

29:28.267 --> 29:30.768
How did you find this place?

29:31.503 --> 29:33.003
- A friend of mine, she
works at the gallery,

29:33.005 --> 29:36.006
she's been here before, so,
yeah.

29:36.008 --> 29:36.006
- It's gorgeous.

29:36.008 --> 29:41.145
It's perfect and rustic and
great for a family gathering.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.846
And I love it.

29:42.848 --> 29:44.214
- I'll drink to that.

29:44.216 --> 29:45.256
- He'll drink to anything.

29:46.285 --> 29:47.151
- Cheers.

29:47.153 --> 29:48.153
- Oh, did we wake you up?

29:49.555 --> 29:50.420
- I'll get it.

29:50.422 --> 29:51.889
- Nuh-nuh-no.

29:51.891 --> 29:52.891
I got it.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.027
- Everybody good on drinks?

29:57.029 --> 29:58.495
- Yeah.

30:00.131 --> 30:01.198
- Hey.

30:01.200 --> 30:03.066
It's good to see you.

30:06.539 --> 30:07.539
Come on in.

30:09.974 --> 30:13.510
Um, Maggie, Aiden, you
remember my parents,

30:14.546 --> 30:18.182
and here are Francis, Liam, and
Sam.

30:18.184 --> 30:20.884
- John, Maureen.
- - Sam.

30:20.886 --> 30:22.953
- Hi.
- - Hi.

30:41.873 --> 30:45.943
- Hey, Liam baby, take a
picture of Nana for me.

30:48.147 --> 30:50.414
- Whose is that?

30:50.416 --> 30:52.049
- Yo.

30:52.051 --> 30:53.116
Yeah, just a sec.

30:53.118 --> 30:55.018
- Liam, where are you going?

30:55.020 --> 30:57.154
- Sorry, Nana, I gotta
take this.

30:57.156 --> 30:58.455
- I hate cellphones.

30:58.457 --> 30:59.990
- I am so sorry.

31:02.227 --> 31:03.627
- Hey, what's up?

31:05.263 --> 31:06.964
Yeah, we're at that house
in the middle of nowhere.

31:06.966 --> 31:08.866
My mom's painting a portrait.

31:08.868 --> 31:09.933
- Hey, Liam.

31:09.935 --> 31:11.001
- Baby, it's fine.

31:11.003 --> 31:12.603
- I guess so, sort of.

31:12.605 --> 31:14.238
Yeah, the whole family.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.639
She even brought her
real mom and stepfather.

31:15.641 --> 31:18.208
Can you believe that?

31:18.210 --> 31:20.878
I told you she was adopted.

31:20.880 --> 31:23.881
Huh, I guess you can call them
my grandparents, technically.

31:23.883 --> 31:25.315
Hadn't thought of it.

31:25.317 --> 31:27.951
Yeah, grandma and grandpa are
here.

31:27.953 --> 31:30.153
Yeah yeah, and franny.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.391
Oh no kidding, it was so ugly.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.659
They came in last night.

31:35.661 --> 31:37.461
- Smoke bothering you?

31:37.463 --> 31:39.162
- It's important to her.

31:39.164 --> 31:40.530
- Liam!

31:40.532 --> 31:43.233
Hang up the phone and get over
here.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.101
- Sam.

31:44.103 --> 31:45.202
- It's rude.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.270
- Listen, I gotta go.

31:46.272 --> 31:47.437
We're still on for tomorrow
night.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.506
Yep, yep, a'ight, later.

31:52.143 --> 31:53.377
- Honey, can we take a break for
a minute?

31:53.379 --> 31:55.312
- You know what, that is a great
idea.

31:55.314 --> 31:58.115
Everybody, let's take a break.

31:58.117 --> 32:00.183
- I gotta hit the head.

32:00.185 --> 32:02.352
- Sam, will you help
daddy set up the grill?

32:02.354 --> 32:03.220
- Yeah, sure.

32:03.222 --> 32:04.222
- Thank you.

32:16.268 --> 32:19.102
- So are you grillin'
today or...?

32:43.695 --> 32:46.330
- All right, what's next?

32:46.332 --> 32:48.732
- I've got coleslaw in the
fridge

32:48.734 --> 32:50.701
and a bowl in that drawer.

32:50.703 --> 32:52.636
- All right.

32:53.604 --> 32:55.005
- Maggie, you need anything?

32:55.007 --> 32:56.206
- No.

32:59.978 --> 33:03.180
- Hm.

33:04.182 --> 33:05.382
- Hm?

33:06.417 --> 33:09.186
- No, I was just, I just said,
"hm."

33:09.188 --> 33:14.057
It was interesting what kind
of potato salad you're making.

33:14.059 --> 33:16.326
- What's that mean?

33:16.328 --> 33:16.326
- Doesn't mean anything,

33:16.328 --> 33:21.732
it just means it's interesting,
all right?

33:21.734 --> 33:24.468
What are you puttin' in it?

33:24.470 --> 33:27.471
- It's an all-mustard potato
salad.

33:30.041 --> 33:31.041
- Mustard?

33:31.609 --> 33:33.043
- That's right.

33:33.045 --> 33:34.644
- No, no mayonnaise?

33:39.317 --> 33:40.517
- That's right.

33:40.519 --> 33:41.718
No mayonnaise.

33:41.788 --> 33:42.687
- Why?

33:42.688 --> 33:42.686
- 'Cause I don't like
mayonnaise.

33:42.688 --> 33:48.125
- Well, but you always make
potato salad with mayonnaise.

33:48.127 --> 33:50.227
- Well, not this one.

33:50.229 --> 33:51.294
- All right.

33:51.571 --> 33:52.530
And why is that?

33:52.531 --> 33:56.366
Is that because of health or
something?

33:56.368 --> 33:59.603
Because I read somewhere that
mayonnaise is just as healthy

33:59.605 --> 34:00.804
as an avocado.

34:03.041 --> 34:05.342
- I don't know about that, mom.

34:05.344 --> 34:08.411
- I just never liked the stuff.

34:08.414 --> 34:10.313
- That's good to know, yeah?

34:10.315 --> 34:11.315
- Yeah.

34:12.717 --> 34:13.717
Oh.

34:15.085 --> 34:16.786
Oh, that's just great.

34:16.789 --> 34:20.724
So we're gonna have
potato salad with mustard.

34:22.393 --> 34:23.527
That's dandy.

34:25.063 --> 34:28.665
- I guess you just
prefer the devil's sperm.

34:28.667 --> 34:29.667
- What?

34:31.202 --> 34:33.070
What did you just say?

34:33.072 --> 34:34.304
- The devil's sperm.

34:34.306 --> 34:35.572
- Oh my god.

34:35.574 --> 34:38.241
- You prefer the devil's sperm?

34:38.243 --> 34:39.409
- You're disgusting.

34:41.780 --> 34:42.780
Jesus.

34:47.150 --> 34:48.085
My god.

34:48.087 --> 34:52.621
Why do you ever let her
talk to me like that?

34:55.293 --> 34:56.293
- Maggie.

34:56.828 --> 34:58.628
- Oh, you devil you.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.472
- John?

35:08.474 --> 35:10.407
- I'll be right there.

35:12.210 --> 35:15.312
- Looks like someone salted her
pie.

35:15.314 --> 35:16.847
- Everything okay?

35:16.849 --> 35:19.249
- It could be anything.

35:19.251 --> 35:19.249
Hey, Aiden.

35:19.251 --> 35:21.618
Are you still out in coryell
county?

35:21.620 --> 35:23.620
- That's right, still there.

35:23.622 --> 35:27.224
I do most of my work out
of jonesboro these days.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.126
- Well, what are you doin' to
keep busy?

35:29.128 --> 35:31.795
- Same thing that's kept me
busy for the last 40 years,

35:31.797 --> 35:33.763
electrical work mostly.

35:33.765 --> 35:37.567
A little carpentry, odd
jobs here and there.

35:38.870 --> 35:40.470
- Oh, here we go.

35:41.606 --> 35:43.773
- We could certainly use a good
handyman

35:43.775 --> 35:45.308
up in the big d.

35:45.310 --> 35:48.678
The only thing I can manage
to change are my diapers.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.915
- And we pray that he remembers
to change 'em every day.

35:51.917 --> 35:53.250
- There we go, I knew it.

35:54.219 --> 35:55.852
- John, you still practice law?

35:55.854 --> 35:57.754
- He knows the license
plate of every ambulance

35:57.756 --> 35:59.189
in tarrant county.

35:59.191 --> 36:00.724
- Yeah, I'm still a partner.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.425
They haven't caught me yet.

36:02.427 --> 36:04.394
- What do you know about life
insurance?

36:04.396 --> 36:06.863
- I know if Maureen knew
how much money we had,

36:06.865 --> 36:08.865
she would have run me over years
ago.

36:10.536 --> 36:11.401
Why, what's up?

36:11.403 --> 36:11.401
What do ya need?

36:11.403 --> 36:16.540
- I, ah, I'm thinking of changing
our policy, age and all,

36:16.542 --> 36:20.744
but these regulations of
preexisting conditions and stuff.

36:22.547 --> 36:24.648
I was just wondering if you knew
someone

36:24.650 --> 36:26.516
- I could talk to.
- - Mom.

36:26.518 --> 36:28.218
Will you help me?

36:28.220 --> 36:30.820
- Ah, well I could email
you a couple of names.

36:30.822 --> 36:32.589
You just send me all of your
information

36:32.591 --> 36:33.924
and I'll do it when I get back.

36:33.926 --> 36:36.560
- If you don't mind,
yeah, that'd be great.

36:36.562 --> 36:37.761
- No, I'd like to do it.

36:37.763 --> 36:38.828
- Thank you, thank you.

36:38.830 --> 36:39.830
- Sure.

36:40.898 --> 36:43.967
Yeah, excuse me, guys, for a
minute.

36:47.939 --> 36:49.472
What's the problem, Maureen?

36:49.474 --> 36:50.874
- You won't believe what she
said to me.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.409
- Momma, please.
- Can't we just...

36:52.411 --> 36:53.777
- mom!

36:53.779 --> 36:55.445
Please.

36:55.447 --> 36:56.447
- Fine.

37:08.459 --> 37:13.330
- Look, look, look, look,
over there on that branch.

37:13.332 --> 37:14.731
- What is that, a bird?

37:14.733 --> 37:17.534
- That's a brown-headed cowbird.

37:18.636 --> 37:20.971
- Oh god, not this again.

37:20.973 --> 37:22.706
- What's a cowbird?

37:22.708 --> 37:25.408
- Well, a cowbird is a member
of the blackbird family

37:25.410 --> 37:27.844
and they've evolved to follow
around

37:27.846 --> 37:31.581
the herds of cows and sheep and
buffalos

37:31.583 --> 37:34.684
and it picks the ticks off of
their backs.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.353
- Wow, this is just like animal
planet.

37:36.355 --> 37:37.520
- There it is.

37:37.522 --> 37:39.589
- Keep goin', daddy.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.992
- She's a brood parasite.

37:41.994 --> 37:43.326
- What's a brood parasite?

37:43.328 --> 37:45.028
- Ah ha, see, the curiosity of
youth.

37:45.030 --> 37:50.500
A brood parasite, see that's
when the female cowbird

37:50.502 --> 37:53.436
lays her eggs in the nest
of other birds, right.

37:53.438 --> 37:55.438
- So they make the
other birds raise their babies?

37:55.440 --> 37:56.339
- Exactly.

37:56.341 --> 37:57.341
- Hey!

37:57.908 --> 38:00.343
What're you sayin'?

38:00.345 --> 38:03.280
- Maggie, he didn't mean
anything.

38:11.055 --> 38:12.422
- God, that's, I'm sorry,

38:12.424 --> 38:13.823
I didn't mean anything really by
it.

38:13.825 --> 38:14.958
- I know.

38:14.960 --> 38:17.761
She'll be all right, just let
her go.

38:17.763 --> 38:21.831
Probably best to just
leave her alone for a bit.

38:25.670 --> 38:26.670
- Sorry.

38:28.939 --> 38:31.641
- Aren't you proud of yourself?

38:44.655 --> 38:45.522
- Hey.

38:45.524 --> 38:46.524
- Hey.

38:47.825 --> 38:50.727
- Come back down and join us.

38:50.729 --> 38:51.761
- Nnh.

38:51.763 --> 38:54.064
I lost my appetite.

38:54.066 --> 38:55.732
- Daddy didn't mean anything.

38:55.734 --> 38:57.500
He has really been into birds.

38:57.502 --> 39:00.537
We got him this book last
Christmas.

39:03.375 --> 39:05.375
I wasn't hungry anyway.

39:11.482 --> 39:12.982
- How are you?

39:12.984 --> 39:15.085
- Fine.

39:15.087 --> 39:16.553
- The hospital?

39:17.688 --> 39:20.523
- Took in a couple of extra
shifts.

39:20.525 --> 39:22.859
I'm workin' six days a week.

39:25.529 --> 39:27.464
- Busy's good.

39:27.466 --> 39:28.798
- Yeah, I guess.

39:31.502 --> 39:32.769
- I'm busy too.

39:33.571 --> 39:35.538
I had a few gallery showings

39:35.540 --> 39:36.840
and a couple new commissions.

39:36.842 --> 39:38.942
- That's nice, real nice.

39:40.511 --> 39:44.714
- A lot of hard work but...

39:45.716 --> 39:47.517
- But what?

39:48.886 --> 39:51.087
- Why'd you stop painting?

39:52.423 --> 39:53.423
- Oh.

39:55.993 --> 39:57.961
Well, I never had the time

39:57.963 --> 40:00.997
or the means to do anything with
it.

40:00.999 --> 40:03.666
I was so busy at the hospital.

40:05.903 --> 40:09.506
I just had a whole lotta things
goin' on.

40:11.709 --> 40:13.009
- I'm sorry.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.878
- For what?

40:14.880 --> 40:16.446
- Well, didn't you love it?

40:16.448 --> 40:19.549
- Hrmph, love has nothing
to do with it, Shannon.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.751
I do what I do to survive.

40:21.753 --> 40:22.852
- I didn't mean...

40:22.854 --> 40:23.853
- What?

40:23.855 --> 40:26.055
What are you talkin' about?

40:26.057 --> 40:29.793
- I just was, was just trying to
talk.

40:29.795 --> 40:31.594
- Talk about what?

40:31.596 --> 40:33.596
- I was just tryin' to,

40:34.698 --> 40:36.199
I really don't know you

40:36.201 --> 40:38.735
or anything about your life, my
father...

40:38.737 --> 40:39.969
- Shannon?

40:39.971 --> 40:42.639
I don't want to talk about it.

40:44.041 --> 40:47.710
Besides it's really none of your
business.

40:48.913 --> 40:51.080
- What do you mean?

40:51.082 --> 40:55.618
- Ahh, well, I see where
this is goin', mm-hmm.

40:55.620 --> 40:58.621
Next thing you're gonna tell me

40:58.623 --> 41:01.458
I'm the one that ruined your
life.

41:01.460 --> 41:02.460
Hm?

41:03.127 --> 41:05.595
- You don't get it, do you?

41:08.899 --> 41:12.569
I was nine years old when
i had my first sleepover,

41:12.571 --> 41:17.073
and it was great, until
it was time to go to bed.

41:17.075 --> 41:20.810
I was just lying there,
thinkin', worrying,

41:22.112 --> 41:23.480
that no one was going to come
back

41:23.482 --> 41:26.549
and pick me up in the morning.

41:26.551 --> 41:28.785
My friend's mother found me
in the middle of the night,

41:28.787 --> 41:28.785
crying in a corner.

41:28.787 --> 41:33.623
She had to call my parents
to come pick me up.

41:35.060 --> 41:37.660
So it's my fault that you
couldn't spend the night

41:37.662 --> 41:39.662
at your friend's house?

41:39.664 --> 41:42.031
- I stood in the front
door in my nightgown

41:42.033 --> 41:44.033
for my parents to come.

41:45.035 --> 41:47.837
I didn't think they were coming.

41:49.573 --> 41:51.708
But, of course, they did.

41:56.146 --> 41:59.082
- So it's all about you, isn't
it?

42:02.953 --> 42:03.953
Well...

42:06.590 --> 42:09.192
I was 17, thought I was in love,

42:12.162 --> 42:16.799
and I got pregnant and i
didn't want to have a baby.

42:16.801 --> 42:20.870
Your father blamed me for
it, so did my parents.

42:22.706 --> 42:26.910
No, I didn't want to have you,
but I didn't have a choice.

42:30.648 --> 42:31.948
And when I gave you up,

42:31.950 --> 42:35.285
you weren't supposed to come
back, ever.

42:36.820 --> 42:38.888
I moved on with my life.

42:42.059 --> 42:43.726
Do you understand?

42:47.831 --> 42:50.133
This has nothin' to do with
love.

42:50.135 --> 42:54.337
This has nothin' to do with
whether I loved you or not.

42:55.906 --> 42:58.841
The truth is, the day you were
born

42:58.843 --> 43:01.811
was the worst day of my life,

43:01.813 --> 43:04.681
'cause I wasn't ready to grow
up.

43:12.856 --> 43:14.791
- Sorry you feel that way.

43:14.793 --> 43:17.961
- I shouldn't be judged for
being honest.

43:17.963 --> 43:18.963
- No.

43:20.097 --> 43:21.097
Not at all.

43:22.766 --> 43:24.367
You are who you are.

44:41.945 --> 44:45.281
- All right, here we go!

44:45.283 --> 44:47.817
- Honey, could you give
me a minute so I could

44:47.819 --> 44:51.454
run into the little ladies'
room and check my face?

44:51.456 --> 44:55.858
- That's right, you're the
only one in this damn picture.

44:58.862 --> 45:01.130
- It is not a picture, it is a
portrait.

45:01.132 --> 45:04.000
It is a family portrait.

45:04.002 --> 45:05.768
Now, I think it means a
great deal to Shannon,

45:05.770 --> 45:08.705
so I think we should all look
our best.

45:08.707 --> 45:08.705
- No, you're right, Maureen.

45:08.707 --> 45:11.240
Your face could use some more
work.

45:11.242 --> 45:12.709
- Maggie, give
it a break, will ya?

45:12.711 --> 45:14.477
- Just shut your face.

45:14.479 --> 45:16.079
- I hit a nerve, did I?

45:16.081 --> 45:18.414
- Dammit, that's enough!

45:18.416 --> 45:21.050
Maybe we should all stop
thinking about ourselves

45:21.052 --> 45:25.254
for a few minutes and try
to remember why we're here.

45:26.290 --> 45:29.225
- I think that's a very good
idea.

45:35.766 --> 45:38.434
- And I thought
pork chop hill was bad.

46:00.190 --> 46:04.060
- Ugh, you would not
believe what's goin' on.

46:05.095 --> 46:06.863
Naw, we're all out there
posin' for the portrait,

46:06.865 --> 46:08.231
and my grandma starts pickin' a
fight

46:08.233 --> 46:10.032
with my mom's real mom.

46:10.034 --> 46:11.034
Classic.

46:12.836 --> 46:14.270
They did not trade blows.

46:14.272 --> 46:17.106
That would have been cool.

46:17.108 --> 46:20.910
Yeah, yeah, I'll be out
there in about 20 minutes.

46:20.912 --> 46:23.479
Mm-hmm, yeah, we passed it on
the way in.

46:23.481 --> 46:25.181
I'll meet ya there.

46:25.183 --> 46:26.449
All right, bye.

46:39.163 --> 46:40.163
- So...

46:44.201 --> 46:46.068
How you doin', honey?

46:47.871 --> 46:50.206
- I'm starting to think
this weekend was a mistake.

46:50.208 --> 46:52.575
- No, it wasn't a mistake.

46:52.577 --> 46:54.310
The guest list was a mistake.

46:54.312 --> 46:54.310
- Mom.

46:54.312 --> 46:56.078
- Oh, she's a hateful woman.

46:56.080 --> 46:57.080
- Mom, god!

46:59.349 --> 47:01.050
It's not about you.

47:01.052 --> 47:03.953
- I know it was your decision,

47:03.955 --> 47:06.489
but I think you could be a
little bit more understanding

47:06.491 --> 47:09.192
about the other people around
here.

47:09.194 --> 47:12.495
I mean, your daddy and Sam,
Liam, me...

47:12.497 --> 47:14.997
- are you saying I'm
not being sympathetic?

47:14.999 --> 47:17.200
- No, I'm not saying that.

47:18.569 --> 47:22.338
You convinced yourself
that this was gonna be

47:22.340 --> 47:25.274
one big happy family this
weekend.

47:26.410 --> 47:28.044
I mean, w-we've talked about
this.

47:28.046 --> 47:29.378
You do it a lot.

47:30.314 --> 47:33.282
You make up your mind
and then the doors close

47:33.284 --> 47:37.420
and the lock is locked and
nobody can get in anym...

47:37.422 --> 47:39.488
- maybe I don't want anyone in!

47:39.490 --> 47:41.023
Do you ever think about that?

47:41.025 --> 47:43.359
Maybe I just want to fit in,

47:44.461 --> 47:46.295
something I've been trying
to do since the fifth grade

47:46.297 --> 47:49.632
and those fucking, fucking
family trees.

47:52.302 --> 47:53.302
- Whew.

47:55.272 --> 47:58.474
Well, you know you were
four-weeks-old

48:00.644 --> 48:04.113
when your daddy and I brought
you home.

48:06.183 --> 48:10.386
I remember asking the woman
at the adoption agency

48:12.256 --> 48:13.656
what I should do,

48:13.658 --> 48:18.961
and she said, "oh, you just
take her home and you love her."

48:20.264 --> 48:24.467
Well, that sure wasn't enough.

48:26.470 --> 48:29.005
Can't tell you how long
it took for me to feel

48:31.242 --> 48:34.977
adequate and not guilty
for taking you away

48:38.482 --> 48:40.249
from another woman,

48:40.251 --> 48:43.519
a woman who happened to be your
mother.

48:47.624 --> 48:49.292
Dammit, I knew it.

48:50.961 --> 48:54.630
I knew when you were
young that at some point

48:55.699 --> 49:00.403
you were gonna go out and
you would try to find her.

49:00.405 --> 49:02.605
That real mother of yours.

49:07.577 --> 49:09.645
Oh god, I was so scared,

49:11.515 --> 49:15.718
so scared that you'd love
her more than you love me.

49:31.702 --> 49:32.635
- Hey, Liam.

49:32.637 --> 49:34.170
Where ya headed?

49:34.972 --> 49:37.139
- Goin' for a run.

49:37.141 --> 49:40.109
- Yeah, I guess we both
needed to get out of there

49:40.111 --> 49:41.577
for a little bit.

49:41.579 --> 49:44.113
- What's goin' on with them,
dad?

49:44.115 --> 49:45.614
Why they fightin' over mom?

49:45.616 --> 49:48.284
- It's complicated.

49:48.286 --> 49:49.685
- It's just weird.

49:49.687 --> 49:51.587
Why can't they just get along
anyways?

49:51.589 --> 49:53.522
- That would be great.

49:54.324 --> 49:56.459
They just don't see it that way.

49:56.461 --> 49:59.328
- Well, at least I got some good
photos.

49:59.330 --> 49:59.328
They're even smiling in some,

49:59.330 --> 50:02.765
so guess they got along okay,
right?

50:02.767 --> 50:07.036
- Yeah, a picture's
worth a thousand words, right?

50:07.038 --> 50:08.571
- Yeah, I guess so.

50:10.340 --> 50:14.643
- Do you know why people
smile in pictures?

50:14.645 --> 50:17.380
Because we tell 'em to.

50:17.382 --> 50:21.650
You can tell somebody to
smile and say "cheese,"

50:21.652 --> 50:25.054
but you can't really fake being
happy.

50:25.689 --> 50:30.092
Your mom, she's just, she's
trying to figure it all out.

50:31.528 --> 50:34.663
You know, find a way to be
happy.

50:34.665 --> 50:36.465
Or at least content.

50:40.337 --> 50:41.804
- Mom's not happy?

50:46.676 --> 50:48.677
- It's not that simple.

50:50.614 --> 50:52.548
Sometimes she's happy.

50:53.750 --> 50:58.154
She's trying to
connect with her past.

50:59.289 --> 51:03.092
Trying to connect with
her past and present.

51:04.194 --> 51:06.695
She wants to find out where she
came from

51:06.697 --> 51:09.698
so that she understands who she
is.

51:13.070 --> 51:15.271
Life isn't just a picture.

51:16.106 --> 51:19.675
It's a series of events
all strung together,

51:22.579 --> 51:26.649
like a puzzle, but no
matter how hard she tries,

51:31.121 --> 51:33.823
she may never find all the
pieces.

51:35.792 --> 51:39.829
And let's face it, women
have more pieces than men.

51:43.101 --> 51:46.102
- I think I'm gonna take off.

51:46.104 --> 51:47.536
- I don't blame ya.

51:47.538 --> 51:48.538
Hey, Liam?

51:50.474 --> 51:52.875
You got your cellphone on ya?

51:54.344 --> 51:57.413
All right, don't stay gone too
long.

52:07.591 --> 52:08.757
- All right, let's play ball!

52:08.759 --> 52:11.760
- All right, let's go it.

52:13.330 --> 52:15.764
- Now you see close only
counts in horseshoes...

52:17.435 --> 52:18.434
And hand grenades!

52:18.436 --> 52:19.301
- Hey!

52:19.303 --> 52:20.436
- Right, pop?

52:23.340 --> 52:25.508
- He was in the Korean war.

52:25.510 --> 52:27.443
- Wow, what was that like?

52:27.445 --> 52:29.411
- It was like a beautiful
picnic,

52:29.413 --> 52:30.479
set on fire.

52:55.873 --> 52:56.873
- Nice shot!

54:15.852 --> 54:17.419
- Franny?

54:17.421 --> 54:18.654
Stay awake.

54:20.291 --> 54:21.291
Hey!

54:22.292 --> 54:23.926
- I'm so hungry I could eat the
ass out

54:23.928 --> 54:25.427
of a low-flying duck.

54:26.297 --> 54:26.295
Oh, great.

54:26.297 --> 54:26.295
Well, have a seat and you two
are gonna sit next to franny.

54:26.297 --> 54:31.333
- Can I get anybody
else a drink while I'm up?

54:31.335 --> 54:33.836
Hey pops, I got you a
bourbon and water, all right?

54:33.838 --> 54:36.305
- Ah, you talked me into it.

54:36.307 --> 54:37.806
- For the love of Pete!

54:37.808 --> 54:40.376
Who made this Shepherd's pie?

54:40.378 --> 54:41.043
- Wow.

54:41.045 --> 54:42.411
- Team effort.

54:42.413 --> 54:44.280
- I was part of the team!

54:44.282 --> 54:46.915
- I watched while they made it.

54:46.917 --> 54:49.685
Hey, can you help me
out and bring it over?

54:49.687 --> 54:51.420
- Oh, sure.

54:54.824 --> 54:56.892
- Oh, I can smell it from here.

54:56.894 --> 54:56.892
Look at that.

54:56.894 --> 54:58.627
- Looks delicious.

54:58.629 --> 54:59.495
- Oh, that looks good.

54:59.497 --> 55:00.497
- Ooh!

55:02.432 --> 55:03.399
- There we go, Aiden.

55:03.401 --> 55:04.401
- All right.

55:05.803 --> 55:08.370
I would like to make a toast.

55:11.007 --> 55:13.042
Thank you all for coming.

55:13.044 --> 55:14.977
I know I've thrown you some
curveballs.

55:14.979 --> 55:16.979
- Some curveballs?

55:16.981 --> 55:19.815
- It's not what you were
expecting,

55:19.817 --> 55:22.484
but I've been thinking about
this weekend

55:22.486 --> 55:24.553
for a long time.

55:24.555 --> 55:27.089
It's been a dream of mine

55:27.091 --> 55:30.426
and the gifts you have brought,

55:30.428 --> 55:32.795
they meant a lot to me.

55:32.797 --> 55:34.930
So, thank you and cheers.

55:35.832 --> 55:36.699
- Cheers.

55:36.701 --> 55:37.701
- Cheers.

55:42.505 --> 55:46.008
- If it's okay, I'd
like to read something.

55:47.444 --> 55:50.846
It's a letter I sent home to
your grandma

55:51.815 --> 55:53.749
from the war in Korea.

55:55.819 --> 55:57.753
It was pork chop hill.

56:02.759 --> 56:04.960
"Good morning, darling."

56:04.962 --> 56:06.895
"Here is another day without
you,"

56:06.897 --> 56:11.567
"but nevertheless, you
are forever on my mind."

56:11.569 --> 56:14.503
"Yesterday I received your
letter."

56:14.505 --> 56:17.840
"You'll never know how happy
that made me."

56:17.842 --> 56:22.678
"It gave me new life and
new strength to carry on."

56:22.680 --> 56:24.446
"This is the first
chance I've had to write"

56:24.448 --> 56:28.117
"since we staged an attack in
two villages"

56:28.119 --> 56:30.652
"in the high mountain."

56:30.654 --> 56:34.723
"We fought all day and
only advanced a few miles"

56:35.692 --> 56:39.928
"and we paid for it dearly
with blood and lives."

56:39.930 --> 56:42.131
"I was in a daze for most of it,"

56:42.133 --> 56:45.734
"with a prayer and your name on
my lips."

56:45.736 --> 56:47.569
"Every step I took I thought of
you,"

56:47.571 --> 56:51.573
"and about our time when
we would be together soon."

56:51.575 --> 56:54.076
"At present, I have 12
men under my command"

56:54.078 --> 56:57.946
"and we're guarding 80 enemy
prisoners."

56:57.948 --> 56:59.581
"This'll all be over soon,"

56:59.583 --> 57:03.852
"and I'll be on my way
home to your loving arms."

57:03.854 --> 57:06.755
"I love you more than the words
of this letter can express."

57:06.757 --> 57:09.491
"Your loving husband, Francis."

57:12.095 --> 57:14.897
I brought this for you, sweetie.

57:22.639 --> 57:24.640
- I love you.

57:27.444 --> 57:29.144
- Would you mind
if I said a blessing?

57:29.146 --> 57:30.146
- Please.

57:34.083 --> 57:37.553
- Bless, o lord, this
food we are about to eat

57:37.555 --> 57:39.855
and we pray you, god, that it
will be good

57:39.857 --> 57:41.790
for our body and soul.

57:42.792 --> 57:47.696
And if there be any poor
creatures hungry or thirsty

57:47.698 --> 57:49.698
walking along the road,

57:50.667 --> 57:54.803
send them in to us that we
could share this food with them,

57:54.805 --> 57:58.640
just as you share your
gifts with all of us.

57:58.642 --> 57:59.675
Amen.

57:59.677 --> 58:02.644
- Amen.
- - Amen.

58:02.646 --> 58:03.712
- All right!

58:04.647 --> 58:06.248
Where are you going?

58:08.585 --> 58:09.251
Ah.

58:09.253 --> 58:10.719
- Dun-dun-dah!

58:11.889 --> 58:14.089
All right, all right, everybody
smile.

58:14.091 --> 58:15.091
- Okay.

58:17.527 --> 58:18.527
- Smile, c'mon!

58:24.834 --> 58:26.001
- All right!

58:26.003 --> 58:29.271
Now who would like some
Shepherd's pie?

58:30.740 --> 58:32.241
All right, you're gonna
have to pass your plates.

58:32.243 --> 58:33.509
It's too hot.

58:33.511 --> 58:35.611
- This looks fantastic.

58:35.613 --> 58:38.113
- Want some butter?

58:38.115 --> 58:39.115
Thank you.

58:39.949 --> 58:41.049
- You want some bread?

58:41.051 --> 58:42.217
- I think I'm gonna...

58:42.219 --> 58:44.620
- This is so good.

58:45.522 --> 58:49.625
- Could someone pass
me some bread, please?

58:49.627 --> 58:50.993
- Oh, sure.

58:50.995 --> 58:52.828
- Would you like some butter?

58:52.830 --> 58:53.695
- There we go.

58:53.697 --> 58:54.897
- There we go.

58:54.899 --> 58:57.266
- And me too.

58:57.268 --> 58:59.101
Pass it down.

58:59.103 --> 59:01.003
- I'd like some more whiskey.

59:01.005 --> 59:01.870
Is that okay?

59:01.872 --> 59:02.738
- Sure.

59:02.740 --> 59:04.206
- Me too.

59:06.175 --> 59:07.175
- Trade ya.

59:10.213 --> 59:12.080
Get this stuff off of...

59:12.082 --> 59:13.815
- Oh, that smells so good,
darling.

59:13.817 --> 59:13.815
- There ya go.

59:13.817 --> 59:18.186
- Liam, did you know that
Maggie was quite a dancer

59:18.188 --> 59:19.188
in her day?

59:20.023 --> 59:21.156
- Maggie?

59:21.158 --> 59:22.291
A dancer?

59:22.293 --> 59:23.725
I didn't know that.

59:23.727 --> 59:25.627
I wouldn't have known
that in a million years.

59:25.629 --> 59:27.162
- So you danced?

59:27.164 --> 59:29.631
- Oh yeah, as a girl I did,

59:33.036 --> 59:34.036
a little.

59:35.738 --> 59:39.207
We went on a tour a little bit
one summer.

59:40.944 --> 59:44.146
- Liam darling, would you
pass the salt and pepper?

59:44.148 --> 59:45.614
- There you go.

59:45.616 --> 59:47.816
- Thank you for all of it.

59:53.089 --> 59:54.089
- Shannon,

59:57.260 --> 01:00:00.929
I bought something dear to my
heart too...

01:00:05.134 --> 01:00:06.768
For you.

01:00:33.796 --> 01:00:34.796
Yeah.

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:34.796
There's these newlyweds

01:00:34.798 --> 01:00:40.268
and they're in a hotel room
in the honeymoon suite,

01:00:41.738 --> 01:00:44.873
and the groom decides that he's
gonna

01:00:45.991 --> 01:00:47.010
let the wife know

01:00:47.011 --> 01:00:51.079
exactly where she stands
before the marriage,

01:00:51.081 --> 01:00:55.317
so he takes off his trousers
and he throws them at her,

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:59.888
and he says, "put those
on!"

01:00:59.890 --> 01:01:02.658
And she says, "i can't
wear your trousers!"

01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:06.862
And he says, "and don't
you forget it!"

01:01:07.830 --> 01:01:09.398
'Cause I'm the one that's always
gonna

01:01:09.400 --> 01:01:12.334
"wear the pants in this family."

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:13.735
And the bride,

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:20.308
she takes off her knickers.

01:01:22.045 --> 01:01:26.348
Throws 'em at him and says,

01:01:26.350 --> 01:01:28.150
"well try these on."

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:32.921
And the groom says, "i
can't wear your g..."

01:01:34.090 --> 01:01:35.724
oh! No, no!

01:01:35.726 --> 01:01:37.793
"I can't get into your
knickers!"

01:01:42.198 --> 01:01:45.000
And the bride says, "and don't-"

01:01:47.203 --> 01:01:50.005
oh, "and you never bloody will"

01:01:50.007 --> 01:01:53.008
if you don't change your
attitude."

01:02:01.418 --> 01:02:03.819
- See what I live with?

01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:05.854
- Well, better you than us.

01:02:15.364 --> 01:02:16.364
Ohh.

01:02:17.133 --> 01:02:19.835
What is wrong with you?

01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:20.502
- Me?

01:02:20.504 --> 01:02:20.502
- Yeah, you.

01:02:20.504 --> 01:02:25.107
I'm just trying to lighten
things up a little bit,

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.107
but oh, no.

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:27.809
- You're doing a hell of a job,
yeah.

01:02:27.811 --> 01:02:30.812
- Woman, you're a nasty piece of
work.

01:02:30.814 --> 01:02:32.247
- Now, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:34.116
- You are nasty.

01:02:34.118 --> 01:02:35.117
- No no, wait one second.

01:02:35.119 --> 01:02:36.418
Anybody else, you want a drink,

01:02:36.420 --> 01:02:38.220
do you want another
drink here at the table?

01:02:38.222 --> 01:02:40.255
- Well, I think she's had
enough.

01:02:40.257 --> 01:02:42.390
- Oh, yeah I've had enough.

01:02:42.392 --> 01:02:45.994
I've had enough of you for this
lifetime!

01:02:48.397 --> 01:02:51.800
- Look, nobody is holding
you hostage, dear.

01:02:51.802 --> 01:02:54.402
You can leave any time you want.

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:58.940
- Well, I didn't even want to
come here in the first place,

01:02:58.942 --> 01:02:59.942
did I, huh?

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:03.545
And I certainly never,
never would have come

01:03:03.547 --> 01:03:05.547
if I'd known you were gonna be
here.

01:03:05.549 --> 01:03:07.516
- Well, then why did you come?

01:03:07.518 --> 01:03:10.118
You can go, you are free to go.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.987
Don't you understand?

01:03:13.956 --> 01:03:16.558
You have given me everything
i have ever wanted

01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:20.095
with this woman at the end of
the table.

01:03:21.197 --> 01:03:22.864
So go on, go ahead, run, run.

01:03:22.866 --> 01:03:23.866
Run away.

01:03:24.967 --> 01:03:26.968
We don't need you here.

01:03:28.905 --> 01:03:30.939
- You're a rude fucking cow.

01:03:30.941 --> 01:03:32.874
- And you're a disgusting pig.

01:03:32.876 --> 01:03:34.376
- Yeah, well go eat shit, bitch.

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:34.376
You go home!

01:03:34.378 --> 01:03:36.111
- All right, that's enough!

01:03:36.113 --> 01:03:36.978
That's enough!

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:36.978
- You bitch.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:40.248
- Goddamn it, that's enough!!

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:46.254
- Maggie?

01:03:47.123 --> 01:03:48.456
- Oof!

01:03:57.166 --> 01:03:59.568
- Y'all are gonna wanna go see
this.

01:03:59.570 --> 01:04:03.605
No, seriously, you gotta
see what I have planned.

01:04:03.607 --> 01:04:06.241
- Oh, Shannon, I'm hunting.

01:04:06.243 --> 01:04:07.175
Come on now.

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:08.043
- Wait!

01:04:08.045 --> 01:04:08.910
- Ladies?

01:04:08.912 --> 01:04:09.945
Ladies!

01:04:09.947 --> 01:04:11.947
I'll take it from here.

01:04:26.529 --> 01:04:28.029
- Why did I think this would be

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:29.431
any different than it is?

01:04:29.433 --> 01:04:32.100
- Sweetheart, don't
kick yourself too hard.

01:04:32.102 --> 01:04:34.502
The weekend isn't over yet.

01:04:34.504 --> 01:04:37.405
How the hell did you arrange all
this

01:04:37.407 --> 01:04:39.908
without anyone gettin' wind of
it?

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:41.476
- It was Liam.

01:04:41.478 --> 01:04:45.046
He put the whole thing
together with his friends.

01:04:45.048 --> 01:04:46.248
- C'mon.

01:04:46.250 --> 01:04:48.083
I still got some kick left in
me.

01:05:16.679 --> 01:05:17.545
- Well?

01:05:17.547 --> 01:05:19.014
- We shall see.

01:05:20.316 --> 01:05:22.017
Drink?

01:05:22.019 --> 01:05:23.019
- Oh yeah.

01:05:57.653 --> 01:05:59.254
- Whoo-hoo!

01:07:39.522 --> 01:07:40.789
- Knock, knock.

01:07:56.605 --> 01:07:58.173
Hey.

01:07:58.175 --> 01:07:59.175
- Hey.

01:08:01.377 --> 01:08:04.446
- Been in here all night long?

01:08:05.281 --> 01:08:06.414
- Most of it.

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:13.088
- Everything okay?

01:08:13.090 --> 01:08:14.756
- Eh, couldn't sleep.

01:08:20.496 --> 01:08:22.430
- I brought you some tea.

01:08:22.432 --> 01:08:23.564
- No.

01:08:23.567 --> 01:08:24.567
- Okay.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.774
That was some surprise party
last night.

01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:37.645
I had no idea you planned it.

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:42.283
How did you pull that off
without me findin' out?

01:08:42.285 --> 01:08:43.484
- The dancing?

01:08:44.553 --> 01:08:46.220
That was all Liam.

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:49.323
Pretty sneaky, huh?

01:08:49.326 --> 01:08:51.126
- Yeah, real sneaky.

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:53.328
Impressive.

01:08:59.335 --> 01:09:01.469
Was it what you expected?

01:09:03.471 --> 01:09:06.541
- I was hoping we'd all have a
good time.

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:09.644
Maggie would relax a
bit and enjoy the music,

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.712
we'd all get to know each other.

01:09:11.715 --> 01:09:14.515
Guess I was asking for too much.

01:09:19.921 --> 01:09:22.189
- "Hey, you wanna try my pants
on?"

01:09:27.731 --> 01:09:29.531
C'mon, it was funny.

01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:36.738
- My mother didn't think so.

01:09:39.175 --> 01:09:41.776
- Yeah.

01:09:50.685 --> 01:09:54.889
I just don't think those two
are ever gonna get along.

01:09:58.527 --> 01:10:02.730
I mean, the only thing
they have in common is you.

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:06.968
- Shouldn't that be enough?

01:10:06.970 --> 01:10:08.836
- It should be.

01:10:09.772 --> 01:10:13.975
- I wasn't expecting this
to be some big love fest.

01:10:15.211 --> 01:10:17.979
I wanted this to pull
us all closer together,

01:10:17.981 --> 01:10:20.381
not tear us further apart.

01:10:27.223 --> 01:10:29.724
- Cut yourself a break.

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:31.392
Heck, those two...

01:10:33.495 --> 01:10:35.763
It's just not gonna happen.

01:10:58.487 --> 01:11:02.357
- You really think smoking
is a good idea right now?

01:11:02.359 --> 01:11:05.593
- Not like it's gonna kill me.

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:08.830
- I wish you wouldn't talk like
that.

01:11:08.832 --> 01:11:10.932
- Well, why quit now?

01:11:10.934 --> 01:11:13.468
- Because I'm asking you to.

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:17.405
Maggie, I love you.

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:21.042
- I know you do.

01:11:21.044 --> 01:11:24.746
- Listen, I know you
didn't want to come here,

01:11:24.748 --> 01:11:27.382
but you're doing this for me,

01:11:27.384 --> 01:11:30.685
so this morning, please talk to
Shannon.

01:11:32.721 --> 01:11:35.590
We need her, you need her.

01:11:35.592 --> 01:11:39.027
Please go and find her
and tell her you're sorry

01:11:39.029 --> 01:11:40.628
about last night.

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:43.431
Can you do that for me?

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:45.933
- Just for you.

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:48.336
- Thank you.

01:12:26.784 --> 01:12:27.743
- What the hell?

01:12:27.744 --> 01:12:30.578
Would you please close the door?

01:12:31.815 --> 01:12:33.881
What are you lookin' at?

01:12:35.117 --> 01:12:36.117
Oh, Christ.

01:12:49.098 --> 01:12:50.098
- Mornin'.

01:12:56.004 --> 01:12:58.740
How's everythin' goin' in here?

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:03.678
- Just finishing what I came
here to do.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:05.012
- Can I come in?

01:13:06.648 --> 01:13:07.648
- Sure.

01:13:14.723 --> 01:13:16.023
- Sable brushes.

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:21.963
- I like the way they
glide across the canvas.

01:13:21.965 --> 01:13:23.765
- May I take a peek?

01:13:35.644 --> 01:13:36.644
Mmm, yeah.

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:43.184
Oh, it's comin' along real good.

01:13:48.724 --> 01:13:49.724
- Slowly.

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:53.761
It's still missin' some pieces.

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:54.763
- Yeah.

01:13:56.131 --> 01:13:58.533
I guess we have some things we
don't know

01:13:58.535 --> 01:13:59.934
about each other.

01:14:01.603 --> 01:14:04.505
- That's why I invited
you here this weekend.

01:14:04.507 --> 01:14:07.041
So we could learn those things.

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:09.644
Some of 'em.

01:14:13.549 --> 01:14:16.484
- Shannon, as much as you want
it,

01:14:18.487 --> 01:14:21.889
you can't fit a lifetime into
three days.

01:14:28.897 --> 01:14:32.500
Will you look at me for a
moment, please?

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:35.736
I'm sorry about last night.

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:43.211
I had a few too many and
i really shouldn't have

01:14:43.213 --> 01:14:44.679
acted that way.

01:14:48.083 --> 01:14:49.550
I'm very sorry.

01:14:50.619 --> 01:14:53.888
- It's not an easy
situation for any of us.

01:14:53.890 --> 01:14:55.156
Especially you.

01:14:56.925 --> 01:14:59.026
I appreciate you being here.

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:01.762
- I appreciate you inviting me.

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:07.835
Maureen and I just...

01:15:07.837 --> 01:15:09.570
- I love my mother.

01:15:11.106 --> 01:15:12.907
- Oh, I know you do.

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:17.678
- She's good to me.

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:28.689
- You know, in the world that i
come from,

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:36.097
you didn't get pregnant
unless you were married.

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:39.567
And even then,

01:15:39.569 --> 01:15:42.637
you sure as hell didn't tell
anyone.

01:15:43.272 --> 01:15:46.207
When it happened to me I was,
hmm,

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:50.211
I was scared and ashamed and
alone.

01:15:55.851 --> 01:16:00.054
I wore the biggest clothes
i could find,

01:16:01.924 --> 01:16:03.324
trying to hide it

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:09.764
and then when I outgrew
'em, I sewed my own.

01:16:09.766 --> 01:16:12.567
Tryin' to hide the truth.

01:16:12.569 --> 01:16:15.336
But you can't hide the truth.

01:16:15.338 --> 01:16:16.938
Can you, Shannon?

01:16:18.574 --> 01:16:20.708
You can't hide the truth.

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:25.313
My daddy, he screamed at me so
loud.

01:16:29.952 --> 01:16:32.687
I thought he was gonna kill me.

01:16:33.689 --> 01:16:34.889
And my mother,

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:39.694
she was so drunk,

01:16:40.929 --> 01:16:43.931
you know, she couldn't stop
crying.

01:16:50.172 --> 01:16:54.375
I don't think she ever looked
at me again after that.

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:02.316
When the nurse...

01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:06.120
Handed me you,

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:12.326
I held you so tight.

01:17:22.037 --> 01:17:26.240
I didn't want to say goodbye.

01:17:31.213 --> 01:17:33.014
And after that, I...

01:17:36.018 --> 01:17:38.019
I got numb for a while.

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:42.790
I started wonderin',

01:17:45.293 --> 01:17:48.829
is this a dream or did it really
happen?

01:17:58.874 --> 01:17:59.874
After that,

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:04.011
that moment...

01:18:09.051 --> 01:18:10.251
I was so angry

01:18:15.957 --> 01:18:16.957
and bitter,

01:18:21.329 --> 01:18:25.966
and I hated myself for
what I had done to you.

01:18:25.968 --> 01:18:28.202
- I don't hate you, Maggie.

01:18:31.707 --> 01:18:32.707
I don't.

01:18:34.176 --> 01:18:37.178
- I would not blame you if you
did.

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:39.046
- I get it.

01:18:43.318 --> 01:18:45.853
That must have been so hard.

01:18:49.958 --> 01:18:53.360
I am sincerely grateful for what
you did.

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:11.212
Well, better get back to work

01:19:11.214 --> 01:19:13.881
if I'm gonna ever finish this.

01:19:16.251 --> 01:19:20.121
We'll see ya outside, okay?

01:19:20.123 --> 01:19:22.056
- That's why I'm here.

01:20:13.375 --> 01:20:14.408
- Hello.

01:20:14.410 --> 01:20:15.576
- Hello to you.

01:20:15.578 --> 01:20:16.911
Can I help?

01:20:16.913 --> 01:20:17.913
- Yeah.

01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:20.981
Now take an end.

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:22.583
Put it down here in front of me.

01:20:24.387 --> 01:20:25.252
- And this one?

01:20:25.254 --> 01:20:26.153
- Uh-huh.

01:20:26.155 --> 01:20:27.321
I'm gonna set it on the end.

01:20:27.323 --> 01:20:28.389
- All right.

01:20:31.059 --> 01:20:34.128
I just hope we don't get rained
out.

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:36.864
- Yeah, me too.

01:20:39.367 --> 01:20:41.602
- Maybe we can all hold
matching umbrellas.

01:20:43.206 --> 01:20:45.206
I think it's been done.

01:20:46.341 --> 01:20:48.309
- You got a heck of a family,
Shannon.

01:20:48.311 --> 01:20:50.044
- Yeah, I like 'em.

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:54.114
- And thanks for havin' us.

01:20:57.619 --> 01:21:00.321
I'm really sorry about last
night.

01:21:00.323 --> 01:21:01.388
- It's okay.

01:21:02.357 --> 01:21:04.058
I talked to Maggie.

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:06.861
- Well...

01:21:10.232 --> 01:21:13.334
Is there anything else I can do
for you?

01:21:16.572 --> 01:21:19.974
- Gather the troops, quickly.

01:21:19.976 --> 01:21:22.543
- No problem, I'm on it.

01:21:23.378 --> 01:21:25.279
- Thanks, Aiden.

01:21:25.281 --> 01:21:26.447
- Hey, mom.

01:21:26.449 --> 01:21:27.915
Check this out.

01:21:29.885 --> 01:21:31.352
Come on, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon.

01:21:31.354 --> 01:21:32.219
- I'm hurrying.

01:21:32.221 --> 01:21:33.087
- Hurry!

01:21:33.089 --> 01:21:33.954
- Oh!

01:21:33.956 --> 01:21:34.956
- Boom.

01:21:37.293 --> 01:21:38.425
How ya feelin' today?

01:21:38.427 --> 01:21:39.427
- I'm good.

01:21:40.328 --> 01:21:41.262
- How 'bout last night?

01:21:41.264 --> 01:21:45.432
- I am so proud of you.

01:21:45.434 --> 01:21:49.303
How did you get your friends to
come here?

01:21:49.305 --> 01:21:51.605
You'll never know how
much that meant to me.

01:21:51.607 --> 01:21:55.075
Now, if we can just get
through the rest of the day.

01:21:56.245 --> 01:21:57.244
- I'm gonna take one more.

01:21:57.246 --> 01:21:58.112
- Ah!

01:21:58.114 --> 01:21:59.146
Oh, jeez.

01:21:59.148 --> 01:22:00.148
- Oh man.

01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:03.350
You have got to be kidding me.

01:22:03.352 --> 01:22:04.952
Give me these.

01:22:04.954 --> 01:22:07.922
I guess I will work in the
studio

01:22:07.924 --> 01:22:09.390
until this passes.

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:24.071
- Poor thing.

01:22:24.073 --> 01:22:26.140
All those interruptions.

01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:31.278
I don't think she's ever
gonna get it finished.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:32.146
What's the matter?

01:22:32.148 --> 01:22:33.480
Are you feelin' okay?

01:22:33.482 --> 01:22:35.616
- Oh, I think my body's given
out on me.

01:22:35.618 --> 01:22:37.985
I'm just gonna sit here for a
minute.

01:22:37.987 --> 01:22:38.719
- I'm gonna go get Sam.

01:22:38.721 --> 01:22:40.454
- No, don't bother.

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:42.623
Not unless he stopped bein' a
doctor

01:22:42.625 --> 01:22:44.491
and started diggin' graves.

01:22:44.493 --> 01:22:46.193
- Maggie, don't talk like that.

01:22:46.195 --> 01:22:46.193
It's gonna be okay.

01:22:46.195 --> 01:22:48.562
- You're gonna be fine.
- - Aiden.

01:22:48.564 --> 01:22:50.564
- You're gonna speak with
Shannon today

01:22:50.566 --> 01:22:51.966
and you're gonna ask her.

01:22:51.968 --> 01:22:53.634
That's why we're here,

01:22:53.636 --> 01:22:56.070
and we need to find out now.

01:22:56.072 --> 01:22:58.238
- Well, we sure didn't
come for the conversation.

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.674
- No, but that's
exactly what we need to have,

01:23:00.676 --> 01:23:03.610
a conversation with Shannon!

01:23:03.612 --> 01:23:06.347
- Well, how about somethin' like
this?

01:23:06.349 --> 01:23:08.015
"Hi, sweetie!"

01:23:08.017 --> 01:23:09.650
"I gave you up for
adoption when you were born"

01:23:09.652 --> 01:23:11.218
"because I didn't want you,"

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:13.988
"and now I'm dyin' and i
need a liver transplant"

01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:18.325
"and I'd like you to be a
living organ donor for me!"

01:23:18.327 --> 01:23:19.460
Hmm?

01:23:19.462 --> 01:23:21.128
How's that, honey?

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:23.697
- Go ahead, joke about it,

01:23:23.699 --> 01:23:27.234
but we have to find out if she
can help.

01:24:27.529 --> 01:24:28.529
- Hey.

01:24:28.531 --> 01:24:29.730
- Hello, dear.

01:24:30.832 --> 01:24:34.435
Get it, deer?

01:24:35.737 --> 01:24:35.736
- Will you round everyone up?

01:24:35.738 --> 01:24:41.442
I think I can get what
i need to finish, okay?

01:24:41.444 --> 01:24:42.676
- Sure, I'll do it for a buck.

01:24:42.678 --> 01:24:43.544
- Oh gosh.

01:24:43.546 --> 01:24:44.546
Go!

01:24:49.151 --> 01:24:50.417
Hey, it's Sam.

01:24:50.419 --> 01:24:51.351
Ah, Shannon sent me up.

01:24:51.353 --> 01:24:52.853
She's ready to wrap things up.

01:24:52.855 --> 01:24:54.521
Can you guys come down?

01:24:54.523 --> 01:24:56.323
- Ah, just a second.

01:25:01.529 --> 01:25:04.465
Um, Maggie's runnin' out of
steam.

01:25:05.733 --> 01:25:07.267
- Is everything okay?

01:25:07.269 --> 01:25:08.535
- Um...

01:25:08.537 --> 01:25:10.437
- I just need to freshen up.

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:12.139
I'll be right down.

01:25:13.408 --> 01:25:15.309
- Is there anything I can do?

01:25:15.311 --> 01:25:17.244
- Everything's fine.

01:25:17.246 --> 01:25:19.646
We'll be down in a few minutes.

01:25:19.648 --> 01:25:21.315
- Okay.

01:25:21.317 --> 01:25:23.784
If there is anything I can do.

01:25:25.753 --> 01:25:27.421
- Nah, we're good.

01:25:28.256 --> 01:25:28.255
We're good.

01:25:28.257 --> 01:25:31.725
Uh, we'll be right down, thanks.

01:25:33.328 --> 01:25:34.328
- Okay.

01:25:37.367 --> 01:25:38.266
Probably.

01:25:38.267 --> 01:25:42.136
We need to get this done
then we can go fishing.

01:25:42.138 --> 01:25:43.437
- Are you guys talking about
fishing?

01:25:43.439 --> 01:25:44.404
- Again.

01:25:44.406 --> 01:25:45.305
- There he is.

01:25:45.307 --> 01:25:46.573
Hey, Liam, what's wrong?

01:25:46.575 --> 01:25:48.609
- Why don't you ask her?

01:25:48.611 --> 01:25:49.510
- Liam.

01:25:49.512 --> 01:25:50.711
- No, Aiden.

01:25:50.713 --> 01:25:52.846
I think you should tell her.

01:25:52.848 --> 01:25:54.715
- Aiden, let's leave.

01:25:56.484 --> 01:25:57.751
- No, we won't.

01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:00.754
Ask her.

01:26:00.756 --> 01:26:00.754
Ask her right now.

01:26:00.756 --> 01:26:02.656
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:26:02.658 --> 01:26:04.691
What are you talking about?

01:26:04.693 --> 01:26:08.262
- I just heard them
talkin' on the balcony.

01:26:08.264 --> 01:26:09.897
She's dying, mom.

01:26:09.899 --> 01:26:12.499
She needs a liver donor.

01:26:12.501 --> 01:26:14.201
- Maggie.

01:26:14.203 --> 01:26:16.336
- She wants you to do it.

01:26:17.272 --> 01:26:18.572
That's the only reason they're
here.

01:26:18.574 --> 01:26:18.572
- Oh, w-wait.

01:26:18.574 --> 01:26:22.609
I don't
understand what's going on.

01:26:22.611 --> 01:26:24.511
- Partial liver transplant.

01:26:24.513 --> 01:26:26.313
- They were talkin' about
how they could drop it on mom

01:26:26.315 --> 01:26:28.315
so that she'd agree to it.

01:26:28.317 --> 01:26:30.284
- She's dying, Shannon.

01:26:30.286 --> 01:26:32.719
- Oh, this is unbelievable.

01:26:32.721 --> 01:26:36.523
- Maggie, why didn't
you just say something?

01:26:37.425 --> 01:26:39.526
- This whole thing is my fault.

01:26:39.528 --> 01:26:40.727
I made her come.

01:26:40.729 --> 01:26:43.297
Don't blame it on her.

01:26:43.299 --> 01:26:45.365
Listen, I'm not proud of a lot
of things

01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:45.365
I've done in my life,

01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:49.636
but I'll be damned if I'm gonna
stand here

01:26:49.638 --> 01:26:53.840
and pretend that we weren't
hoping that Shannon could help.

01:26:56.344 --> 01:26:58.579
If we went about this
the wrong way, I'm sorry.

01:26:58.581 --> 01:27:03.350
If we hurt your feelings,
I'm very, very sorry.

01:27:03.352 --> 01:27:06.486
I don't know what to do,
Shannon.

01:27:06.488 --> 01:27:09.690
I've no right to, but I'm
begging you.

01:27:13.995 --> 01:27:14.995
- Maggie?

01:27:17.966 --> 01:27:20.567
- I never wanted any of this.

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:27.274
I wasn't supposed to be in your
life,

01:27:27.276 --> 01:27:29.743
and you weren't
supposed to be in mine.

01:27:29.745 --> 01:27:33.013
But that all changed when you
found me.

01:27:39.687 --> 01:27:40.754
You grew up,

01:27:44.425 --> 01:27:46.293
it was a good family.

01:27:47.762 --> 01:27:51.031
You have a wonderful mother and
father.

01:27:52.033 --> 01:27:55.302
You married a good, smart man,
kind.

01:28:00.408 --> 01:28:04.544
Maureen, you surrounded
her with a loving family,

01:28:13.521 --> 01:28:16.056
somethin' I couldn't offer her.

01:28:19.927 --> 01:28:21.862
And just knowin' that,

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:28.835
it's given me a sense of peace
that I...

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:37.978
I haven't felt in a very long
time.

01:28:44.686 --> 01:28:46.887
In a very, very long time.

01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:49.856
- It's okay.

01:28:49.858 --> 01:28:50.858
It's okay.

01:28:52.527 --> 01:28:54.528
We're gonna figure this out,
okay?

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:02.903
Maggie and I were strangers in
many ways.

01:29:05.106 --> 01:29:06.940
Who knows, maybe we weren't
meant to meet.

01:29:06.942 --> 01:29:10.777
I know she didn't think
we were supposed to,

01:29:10.779 --> 01:29:13.613
but something pushed us
together.

01:29:16.017 --> 01:29:20.454
Whether it was me searching to
find myself

01:29:20.456 --> 01:29:23.056
or Maggie searching for a match,

01:29:27.995 --> 01:29:29.529
which I was not,

01:29:32.867 --> 01:29:35.602
something forced us to connect.

01:29:46.748 --> 01:29:49.883
Maggie thought her life was a
failure

01:29:51.619 --> 01:29:54.154
because she made bad decisions.

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:58.525
But that's not true.

01:29:59.894 --> 01:30:02.396
She had me, she put me up for
adoption.

01:30:02.398 --> 01:30:03.797
She gave me life.

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:09.836
And because of that, she
gave me all the people

01:30:09.838 --> 01:30:12.439
who taught me how to live it.

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:19.713
And she gave me three days in
August,

01:30:25.987 --> 01:30:29.189
and for that, I am eternally
grateful.
