WEBVTT

00:04.771 --> 00:07.006
Hey guys, can I share
something with you?

00:07.008 --> 00:08.340
Sure.
Yeah. Go ahead.

00:08.342 --> 00:11.944
Well, you know how I don't ever
brag about my sexual exploits.

00:11.946 --> 00:13.679
That would be an
accurate statement, yes.

00:13.681 --> 00:17.116
Well, last night,
Bonnie and I got really kinky.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.283
She painted my toenails.

00:18.285 --> 00:19.151
(giggles)

00:19.153 --> 00:21.120
Wha...?
You serious?

00:21.122 --> 00:23.022
Check it out.

00:24.791 --> 00:26.291
What the hell is that?!

00:26.293 --> 00:27.359
Nail polish.

00:27.361 --> 00:28.460
No. The foot.

00:28.462 --> 00:31.130
It's a child's foot, Joe.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.298
Wha... I-I don't... you-you were
crippled when you were an adult.

00:33.300 --> 00:34.366
How the hell did...?
Yeah.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.135
A few months back,
I got really drunk

00:36.137 --> 00:38.303
and was playing around
with an elastic band.

00:38.305 --> 00:41.140
I wrapped it around my thigh
and forgot about it

00:41.142 --> 00:44.009
for a week or two and uh, yeah,
so, that's my left foot now.

00:44.011 --> 00:45.144
(sighs)

00:45.146 --> 00:46.645
I mean,
it still works the same.

00:46.647 --> 00:47.813
Oh, yeah, sure.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.348
Still a foot, I guess.

00:49.350 --> 00:50.682
CLEVELAND:
Whassup?

00:50.684 --> 00:51.984
( <i>The Cleveland Show</i> theme
stinger plays)

00:51.986 --> 00:53.352
Oh, hey, Cleveland.
Hi.

00:53.354 --> 00:54.887
Wait, don't you have
a show to do?

00:54.889 --> 00:56.822
(laughs):
Oh... That's right.

00:56.824 --> 00:58.991
All right.
I knew this was coming.

00:58.993 --> 01:00.659
Everybody give me
your best shot.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.194
Oh, my God.
Where do I even begin?

01:02.196 --> 01:03.996
You know,
it's not a good sign

01:03.998 --> 01:04.897
that this is
the first time

01:04.899 --> 01:05.998
a lot of people
are realizing

01:06.000 --> 01:06.999
you <i>had</i> a show.

01:07.001 --> 01:08.333
Your logo was stupid.

01:08.335 --> 01:09.835
It looked like
a big, purple penis

01:09.837 --> 01:10.869
and your ratings blew.

01:10.871 --> 01:13.705
We did about the same
as <i>Bob's Burgers.</i>

01:13.707 --> 01:14.840
That's your bar!?

01:14.842 --> 01:16.041
Oh, shame on you!

01:16.043 --> 01:18.077
This is good.
This is constructive.

01:18.079 --> 01:19.912
The talking bear
was so bad,

01:19.914 --> 01:22.381
Seth MacFarlane quit voicing him
after season two.

01:22.383 --> 01:24.683
It's hard to make
a talking bear funny.

01:24.685 --> 01:27.519
(laughing): It worked out
okay in movie form.

01:27.521 --> 01:29.555
What was supposed to be
the show's audience?

01:29.557 --> 01:30.556
Who did you make it for?

01:30.558 --> 01:31.690
Like, some black guy

01:31.692 --> 01:33.225
who's never met
another black guy?

01:33.227 --> 01:35.027
Anything else?
Yeah.

01:35.029 --> 01:38.030
Here's four seasons worth of
DVDs of what we've been up to.

01:38.032 --> 01:39.765
You know, just so you're
back up the speed.

01:39.767 --> 01:43.235
And I'll warn you ahead of time:
these have jokes in them.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.070
I...

01:45.072 --> 01:47.539
I don't have
a DVD player.

02:53.641 --> 02:54.940

I think a lot of times
you only say things

You're right.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.996
Well, we'll all have

04:24.198 --> 04:25.197
Yeah, no problem,
Cleveland.

04:25.199 --> 04:26.398
Hey, where do you
want me to put

04:26.400 --> 04:27.866
all these giraffe
figurines?

04:27.868 --> 04:28.867
Just spread 'em out.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.203
Don't make any one
room too giraffey.

04:31.205 --> 04:33.038
Cleveland, where should
I hang the mirror?

04:33.040 --> 04:34.106
Right about here?

04:34.108 --> 04:35.607
Maybe a
little higher.

04:35.609 --> 04:37.042
Oh, like, uh,
up here?

04:37.044 --> 04:38.710
I think
maybe higher.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.379
You don't want
it too high, now.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.447
Let's get you a
different job, Joe.

04:42.449 --> 04:43.749
Are you sure?

04:43.751 --> 04:45.917
'Cause I already hung
all these paintings.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.954
This place is shaping up
real nice.

04:51.924 --> 04:53.759
Hey, Cleveland,
what's that?

04:53.761 --> 04:55.560
Oh, this is
my bead door.

04:55.562 --> 04:56.628
It looks stupid.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.363
Why don't you walk
through it?

05:01.734 --> 05:02.934
How do you feel?

05:02.936 --> 05:04.236
Awesome!

05:04.238 --> 05:06.571
Like a suitcase
comin' out of the airport.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.073
Yeah, or
like a bug

05:08.075 --> 05:10.509
walkin' through
Stevie Wonder's hair.

05:14.747 --> 05:17.916
Turns out this old house is
lacking in storage space,

05:17.918 --> 05:19.918
so I gotta make some
tough decisions.

05:19.920 --> 05:21.486
You gonna keep
these neckties?

05:21.488 --> 05:22.921
Yeah, throw 'em
in my car.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.423
They're just to keep
my trunk closed

05:24.425 --> 05:26.124
what if I'm ever
haulin' garbage.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.326
I ain't no lawyer.

05:27.328 --> 05:29.261
I use whatever
for my purposes.

05:29.263 --> 05:30.796
Could be a box spring.

05:30.798 --> 05:32.097
Could be a
old radio.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.999
Could be a more
recent radio...

05:34.001 --> 05:34.966
Wait, now
I'm confused.

05:34.968 --> 05:37.002
So... so some of this
stuff isn't trash?

05:37.004 --> 05:38.470
Like this
old computer monitor?

05:38.472 --> 05:39.938
Nah, that's a
sittin' chair,

05:39.940 --> 05:40.939
what for children.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.507
How about this telephone cord?

05:42.509 --> 05:43.942
That's a pet leash.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.311
If the good Lord decideth
we should have one.

05:46.313 --> 05:47.979
I'm gonna go
ahead and ditch

05:47.981 --> 05:50.115
these promotional
McDonald's cups
from the 80's.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.817
Nah, that's all
we drink from.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.285
That's the Riddler
right there.

05:53.287 --> 05:56.288
He would make inquiries
to set your mind a-jumble.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.690
How do you live in a
house with all this junk?

05:58.692 --> 06:00.659
I'd rather stay in a
house with small kids.

06:00.661 --> 06:03.028
So you can sleep
on the couch.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.996
Uh, please take
the potty seat
off the toilet,

06:04.998 --> 06:06.164
don't try to
pee through it.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.033
There's juice boxes
in the fridge

06:08.035 --> 06:10.369
and if you get hungry,
there's plenty of
Goldfish in the couch.

06:10.371 --> 06:13.372
Um, feel free to watch
TV with the sound off.

06:13.374 --> 06:14.973
And the kids
will be down here

06:14.975 --> 06:17.676
first thing in the morning
to antagonize the dogs.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.745
Oh, and everyone
here has pinkeye.

06:24.817 --> 06:27.719
"...And that was the moment
I stopped being Dwayne Johnson

06:27.721 --> 06:29.988
and started being The Rock."

06:29.990 --> 06:31.857
That's a good place
to leave off.

06:31.859 --> 06:33.225
Hey, I just realized.

06:33.227 --> 06:34.226
We're The Rock!

06:34.228 --> 06:35.327
What do you mean?

06:35.329 --> 06:36.695
Together, you and I

06:36.697 --> 06:38.997
make one biracial
wrestler.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.866
(gasps) Do you have any
folding chairs?

06:40.868 --> 06:42.033
No.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.068
That's all right.
I'll use this.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.202
Folding chair!

06:44.204 --> 06:45.203
Ow!

06:45.205 --> 06:46.338
DONNA:
What was that?!

06:46.340 --> 06:47.506
(gasps)

06:47.508 --> 06:49.174
That was my
great-grandma's vase!

06:49.176 --> 06:50.876
On the drive up
from Virginia,

06:50.878 --> 06:52.811
she kept that vase
'tween her legs.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.080
W-What are you doing?!

06:55.082 --> 06:57.349
Making sure you
learn your lesson.

06:57.351 --> 06:59.017
Ow! It hurts!

06:59.019 --> 07:00.218
It hurts!

07:00.220 --> 07:02.220
I can't believe Japanese men

07:02.222 --> 07:03.889
pay good money for this.

07:03.891 --> 07:06.892
At work, I am
important businessman.

07:06.894 --> 07:10.462
Here, I am bad boy!

07:19.039 --> 07:20.906
Ew, they're
all gross!

07:20.908 --> 07:22.541
I'm keeping
the roses.

07:22.543 --> 07:25.043
Mom!
Mrs. Brown spanked me!

07:25.045 --> 07:26.211
What?!

07:26.213 --> 07:28.580
And you still haven't
pulled up your pants?

07:28.582 --> 07:29.748
Chris, what
happened?

07:29.750 --> 07:31.917
I was playing with Rallo
and I broke a vase

07:31.919 --> 07:34.052
and then she gave me
a spanking!

07:34.054 --> 07:36.721
Uh, I believe the term
is "whuppin'", Chris.

07:36.723 --> 07:38.390
God, look at the size
of that handprint.

07:38.392 --> 07:40.058
It's like Doctor J.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.293
Peter, this
is serious!

07:41.295 --> 07:42.961
A woman hit
our child!

07:42.963 --> 07:44.563
What is wrong
with her?

07:44.565 --> 07:46.932
Whoa, can I get
some white bread

07:46.934 --> 07:48.133
on that judgmental
sandwich?

07:48.135 --> 07:50.068
Brian, why are you
bringing race into this?

07:50.070 --> 07:51.603
Lois, I've
spent my life

07:51.605 --> 07:53.472
trying to keep
race out of things.

07:53.474 --> 07:55.140
That's why whenever
I walk into Lids,

07:55.142 --> 07:56.575
every guy
fist-bumps me.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.243
Oh, you're
full of crap, Brian.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.078
I'm just saying,
Lois, some of us

08:00.080 --> 08:01.580
go through life
without seeing color.

08:01.582 --> 08:03.615
That's because you're
color blind, Brian.

08:03.617 --> 08:04.616
You're right.

08:04.618 --> 08:05.917
I am color blind.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.085
Here...

08:07.087 --> 08:08.320
and here.

08:08.322 --> 08:10.422
Hey, remember when you
swallowed that rib-eye bone

08:10.424 --> 08:11.756
and you couldn't
poop it out?

08:11.758 --> 08:12.924
And then you
pushed real hard

08:12.926 --> 08:14.960
and the poo came through
the rib eye hole?

08:14.962 --> 08:17.629
Peter, we gotta go
over there and
talk to Donna.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.764
All right, but you need
to cool down first, Lois.

08:19.766 --> 08:21.099
Find a way
to channel your anger.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.468
What I do is throw
a shot put into a crowd

08:23.470 --> 08:25.070
and make it look
like an accident.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.140
(grunts)

08:29.142 --> 08:31.510
I forgot to make it
look like an accident.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.114
(doorbell ringing)

08:36.116 --> 08:37.816
That woman
is gonna be sorry

08:37.818 --> 08:39.351
she laid her hands
on our son.

08:39.353 --> 08:41.119
Hello.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.120
Hi, j-just
so you know,

08:42.122 --> 08:43.455
this is sort of
Lois's thing.

08:43.457 --> 08:44.990
I-I'm not really
upset about it.

08:44.992 --> 08:45.991
So... go
ahead, dear.

08:45.993 --> 08:47.158
Donna, what gives you

08:47.160 --> 08:48.660
the right to
spank my child?

08:48.662 --> 08:50.862
It always smells like
the same meal over here.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.464
I hit him
for a reason.

08:52.466 --> 08:53.965
He broke my vase.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.001
And maybe I wouldn't have
to discipline your child

08:56.003 --> 08:57.702
if you did
it yourself!

08:57.704 --> 08:58.870
Oh, please!

08:58.872 --> 09:00.472
The only thing kids
learn from spanking

09:00.474 --> 09:02.807
is adults don't have the
patience to teach them.

09:02.809 --> 09:03.975
Bull honkey.

09:03.977 --> 09:04.976
What?!

09:04.978 --> 09:05.976
I don't spank,

09:05.978 --> 09:07.812
and my children are
very well-behaved.

09:07.814 --> 09:08.880
Oh, yeah?

09:08.882 --> 09:11.082
Your baby's on
the roof right now.

09:13.152 --> 09:14.051
Stewie!

09:14.053 --> 09:15.687
You get down from there
this instant!

09:15.689 --> 09:17.022
Munch me, bitch!

09:17.024 --> 09:19.157
Right now, Stewie,
or you're in time-out!

09:19.159 --> 09:20.825
How many gray pubes
you pluck today,

09:20.827 --> 09:21.826
you old bag?

09:21.828 --> 09:23.495
Your time-outs
are a joke.

09:23.497 --> 09:24.829
You're a
terrible parent.

09:24.831 --> 09:26.364
I'm a terrible
parent?!

09:26.366 --> 09:27.866
You're a child abuser!

09:27.868 --> 09:29.034
You know what?

09:29.036 --> 09:30.835
From now on, I don't
want our families

09:30.837 --> 09:32.504
having anything to do
with each other!

09:32.506 --> 09:34.706
Well, Cleveland, looks like
these two little alley cats

09:34.708 --> 09:36.508
have scrapped it out.
I'll see you tomorrow.

09:36.510 --> 09:37.842
That includes
you, Peter.

09:37.844 --> 09:40.011
I don't want you ever
talking to Cleveland again.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.546
And Cleveland,
I forbid you

09:41.548 --> 09:43.782
from ever talking
to Peter again!

09:51.023 --> 09:52.524
Hey, Lois, look!

09:52.526 --> 09:53.725
I'm smoking!

09:53.727 --> 09:55.193
You can't control dick!

09:55.195 --> 09:57.462
I'm a roof baby now!

10:01.434 --> 10:03.201
So we're
making plans

10:03.203 --> 10:05.070
for Susie's first
birthday party.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.037
Oh, that's good bar talk.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.205
Hey, y'all..

10:07.207 --> 10:09.040
Oh, oh, uh, sorry,
Peter, I'll...

10:09.042 --> 10:10.041
I'll get
outta here.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.042
No, no, no, no,
I'll go.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.043
I'll go.
It's okay.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.211
What's goin' on?

10:13.213 --> 10:15.046
You guys touch
pee-pees or
something?

10:15.048 --> 10:16.047
I wish.

10:16.049 --> 10:18.116
No, our wives
got in a big fight

10:18.118 --> 10:20.051
and banned us from
seeing each other.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.052
So what if they're in a fight?

10:21.054 --> 10:22.587
What does that have
to do with you?

10:22.589 --> 10:23.922
Well, I gotta
live with Donna.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.857
Uh-oh.
There she is.

10:27.059 --> 10:28.560
Oh, no!
Peter, quick!

10:28.562 --> 10:29.961
Change pigments!

10:34.066 --> 10:35.934
That was close.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.470
Peter, we can't risk
seeing each other.

10:38.472 --> 10:41.606
But, Cleveland, you and I are
pals, and I just got you back.

10:41.608 --> 10:43.441
Well, there might
be one solution.

10:43.443 --> 10:46.578
We just got to hang out where
there's no chance we'll be seen.

10:46.580 --> 10:48.079
You know,
keep it a secret.

10:48.081 --> 10:49.447
Then that's what we'll do.

10:49.449 --> 10:51.116
'Cause I can't
lose you again, Cleveland.

10:51.118 --> 10:54.252
I'm closer to you than
I am to my own right hand.

10:54.254 --> 10:56.955
Oh, my God,
you like scrambled eggs, too?

10:56.957 --> 10:59.124
Here, go ahead, have some.

10:59.126 --> 11:01.092
Whoa, that's a big bite there.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.293
Slow down, buddy.

11:02.295 --> 11:04.095
(makes choking sounds)

11:04.097 --> 11:06.264
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! He's choking!

11:06.266 --> 11:08.933
Thanks for coming.

11:08.935 --> 11:10.769
Thank you... Thank you...

11:10.771 --> 11:11.836
Thanks for coming.

11:14.774 --> 11:16.441
Why you thought
it was appropriate

11:16.443 --> 11:19.244
to show up here, Cheryl,
I have no idea.

11:22.782 --> 11:24.983
Are you sure this is
the best solution, Peter?

11:24.985 --> 11:27.118
I just figured a plane
is a safe place

11:27.120 --> 11:29.821
where you and I can hang out
and not be seen by our wives.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.489
Oh, that makes sense.
So, what have you been up to?

11:31.491 --> 11:33.458
Yup, sorry, Cleveland, I'm gonna
have to cut you off there.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.026
Whenever I ride on a plane,

11:35.028 --> 11:37.028
I have to put on my
noise-cancelling head phones.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.964
Leaves me alone
with nothing but my thoughts.

11:39.966 --> 11:42.000
<i>But I don't</i> want
<i>to kill all these people!</i>

11:42.002 --> 11:44.469
<i>I don't care about the</i>
<i>alignment of the dark forces!</i>

11:44.471 --> 11:46.938
<i>Leave me alone!</i>

11:48.140 --> 11:50.141
CLEVELAND:
<i>I love my wife Donna.</i>

11:50.143 --> 11:52.977
<i>I wish she and Peter's wife</i>
<i>got along better.</i>

11:52.979 --> 11:55.513
<i>That's why</i>
<i>we're on this airplane.</i>

11:55.515 --> 11:57.749
<i>I'm Cleveland.</i>

12:00.019 --> 12:01.720
(siren blaring)

12:01.722 --> 12:03.421
Ah, dang it!

12:06.225 --> 12:09.227
Do you have any idea how
fast you were going, sir?

12:09.229 --> 12:11.830
Peter?!
Hey, Cleveland, this
is just so we can talk

12:11.832 --> 12:13.331
without getting spotted
by Lois and Donna.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.667
I need you to step
out of the car, sir.

12:15.669 --> 12:17.235
Peter, there's got
to be a better way...

12:17.237 --> 12:19.738
He's got a knife!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

12:19.740 --> 12:21.406
Sorry, Cleveland,
it's got to be authentic.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.007
Ow! Ow!
Stay down!
Stay down!

12:23.009 --> 12:24.676
Cleveland, try
to grab my gun.

12:24.678 --> 12:26.845
Oh, trying to grab
my gun, are you?

12:26.847 --> 12:28.913
Ow! Ow!

12:29.915 --> 12:32.083
Hey, rookie, save some for me.

12:32.085 --> 12:35.386
Wow, the whole
gang's back together.

12:35.388 --> 12:36.421
Shut up!

12:36.423 --> 12:38.056
We don't need you
in this town!

12:38.058 --> 12:40.091
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

12:40.093 --> 12:42.627
(whispering):
We don't need you in this town.

12:53.072 --> 12:54.873
Oh, oh, oh, hi, Lois.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.441
You were with
Cleveland,
weren't you?

12:56.443 --> 12:57.442
No!

12:57.444 --> 12:58.877
Then what were you doing?

12:58.879 --> 13:00.111
I'm, uh...

13:00.113 --> 13:01.746
I'm having an affair.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.047
That's ridiculous.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.082
It's not ridiculous.

13:04.084 --> 13:05.216
It's Cybill Shepherd.

13:05.218 --> 13:07.051
She's attainable
for a guy like me now.

13:07.053 --> 13:08.219
Peter, enough lies.

13:08.221 --> 13:10.255
I know you were with Cleveland.

13:10.257 --> 13:13.725
Until further notice,
you can sleep downstairs.

13:13.727 --> 13:15.393
(sighs)

13:15.395 --> 13:16.728
Aw, man.

13:16.730 --> 13:18.630
I wonder how it's going
for Cleveland.

13:18.632 --> 13:20.064
DONNA:
Cleveland, Get in here!

13:20.066 --> 13:21.299
And pull your pants down!

13:21.301 --> 13:23.401
(spanking)
(Cleveland screaming)

13:23.403 --> 13:26.971
CLEVELAND:
At least turn me over
to my back side!

13:33.312 --> 13:34.779
MALE ANNOUNCER:
We now return to

13:34.781 --> 13:37.782
"Slightly Too Early Comedy Club
Audience Member."

13:37.784 --> 13:40.084
Not like when Clinton was
in the White House, huh?

13:40.086 --> 13:41.586
When Clinton was
in the White House,

13:41.588 --> 13:43.421
all you needed to vote was
a piece of duct tape and a...

13:43.423 --> 13:44.756
(laughing)

13:44.758 --> 13:46.257
Yes, yes!

13:46.259 --> 13:48.993
But things are different
with the Republican majority.

13:48.995 --> 13:51.095
They're totally in the pocket
of the oil companies.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.097
I mean, the President
of the United States

13:53.099 --> 13:54.265
might as well be...
(laughs)

13:54.267 --> 13:56.100
Amen! Why not?

13:56.102 --> 13:57.435
Why not, right?

13:57.437 --> 13:59.170
But I guess
it could be worse.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.638
The other day,
my wife asked me

14:00.640 --> 14:02.340
if her ass looked fat
in her jeans.

14:02.342 --> 14:03.775
And I'm like, "Honey..."

14:03.777 --> 14:06.010
Oh, no!
(laughing)

14:06.012 --> 14:08.613
Wow. Wow!

14:08.615 --> 14:10.949
Dad, what are you
doing down here?

14:10.951 --> 14:12.517
Eh, your mom's making me
sleep on the couch

14:12.519 --> 14:14.118
'cause she caught me
hanging out with Cleveland.

14:14.120 --> 14:15.286
How about you?

14:15.288 --> 14:17.288
Mom's making me sleep
in the basement.

14:17.290 --> 14:19.958
Sleeping lower in the house is
a big punishment for her.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.492
Well, this isn't working.

14:21.494 --> 14:22.961
I can't keep sneaking around

14:22.963 --> 14:24.128
trying to hang out
with Cleveland.

14:24.130 --> 14:26.030
Maybe you could figure
out a way to get

14:26.032 --> 14:27.866
Mom and Mrs. Brown
to be friends.

14:27.868 --> 14:29.834
Yeah, you know,
I bet I can.

14:29.836 --> 14:32.203
I mean, I'm the guy who figured
out how much eye contact

14:32.205 --> 14:34.739
a band should make
during a guitar solo.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.478
Yeah, we're in sync,
and showing others

14:40.480 --> 14:42.547
how much we love the song.

14:43.983 --> 14:47.218
Okay, okay, time
to turn away now, Vince.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.722
Come on, we got
a lot of song left!

14:50.724 --> 14:52.790
Turn away!
Look at something else!

14:54.393 --> 14:57.762
I'm glad you didn't listen.

15:02.001 --> 15:03.668
Chris is right.

15:03.670 --> 15:05.136
I got to do something.

15:59.625 --> 16:02.560
All right, Cleveland, nothing
bonds women together like

16:02.562 --> 16:04.762
having to take care of invalid
husbands in the hospital.

16:04.764 --> 16:06.397
What?
Don't die!

16:06.399 --> 16:08.466
(Cleveland screams)

16:11.737 --> 16:12.937
(crying):
Oh, Cleveland,

16:12.939 --> 16:16.808
I'm gonna hate
those Griffins forever.

16:16.810 --> 16:19.477
Only my side had airbags.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.748
Peter, what are we doing here?

16:23.750 --> 16:25.917
Well, women will
always band together

16:25.919 --> 16:28.252
to stop an offensive art
exhibit from coming to town.

16:28.254 --> 16:30.955
So I've arranged for all
my photos of baby wieners

16:30.957 --> 16:32.924
to be put on display.

16:32.926 --> 16:35.827
Oh, Peter, I'm gonna have
to call the police on this.

16:35.829 --> 16:37.261
What? Why?

16:37.263 --> 16:38.963
It's to get our wives
back together!

16:38.965 --> 16:40.932
Peter, these are
hundreds of naked babies

16:40.934 --> 16:43.101
in suggestive situations!

16:43.103 --> 16:45.937
And they're time-stamped
as far back as 1998,

16:45.939 --> 16:48.940
which is way before
we had this idea!

16:48.942 --> 16:51.409
(crying):
I need help!

16:53.645 --> 16:55.947
All right, Cleveland, one thing
that always bonds women

16:55.949 --> 16:57.515
is healing an abused animal.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.450
So I got us
an injured bald eagle.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.452
Somebody put cigarettes out
all over him.

17:01.454 --> 17:03.121
Peter, that's a symbol
of our country.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.289
This particular eagle
is a dick.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.025
Everything out of its mouth
is a taunt.

17:07.027 --> 17:08.493
Peter, you're
being ridiculous.

17:08.495 --> 17:09.994
And you need to release
that eagle out into the...

17:09.996 --> 17:11.496
(squawks)

17:11.498 --> 17:12.663
What'd that eagle say?

17:12.665 --> 17:14.132
(squawks)

17:14.134 --> 17:16.200
Lock the door.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.937
(children laughing)

17:21.874 --> 17:23.708
Peter, let's just
give Susie her gift,

17:23.710 --> 17:25.009
eat our cake and leave.

17:25.011 --> 17:28.012
I don't want to be here
with that Brown family.

17:28.014 --> 17:30.381
That sounds even more racist
than it is.

17:31.817 --> 17:33.885
Ladies and gentlemen,
I give you...

17:33.887 --> 17:36.154
The Great Quagini!

17:36.156 --> 17:38.389
Hey-ey, everybody!
There's the birthday girl!

17:38.391 --> 17:40.525
Oh, oh, what's that
behind your ear?

17:40.527 --> 17:42.326
Oh, it's a condom!

17:42.328 --> 17:45.496
Quagmire, please stop touching
my baby with a condom.

17:45.498 --> 17:46.864
And for my next trick,
I'm gonna split

17:46.866 --> 17:48.533
my beautiful assistant in half.

17:48.535 --> 17:50.568
And not the way you think.
(laughs)

17:50.570 --> 17:53.037
Won't be needing this.

17:53.039 --> 17:55.006
Okay, time
for the three-legged race.

17:55.008 --> 17:56.841
Pair up, everyone.

17:56.843 --> 17:58.176
All right, Peter,
let's do it.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.244
You're my three-legged
race partner.

What?!

18:34.881 --> 18:36.114
I'm gonna be partners

Peter, I told you...

And I'm telling you,
Cleveland and I have won

every three-legged race
in Quahog except that time

18:42.055 --> 18:43.554
those two one-legged guys formed

18:43.556 --> 18:45.623
the perfect running person.

Cleveland, what do you
think you're doing?!

18:48.061 --> 18:49.093
Peter's right.

18:49.095 --> 18:50.962
We're friends and that's that.

18:50.964 --> 18:53.064
This whole fight is ridiculous.

18:53.066 --> 18:57.068
Now, let's go win a
race with no prize.

whistling, applauding)

19:12.318 --> 19:13.651
Are we beating anyone?

19:13.653 --> 19:16.654
I waited too long
to pick a partner.

19:21.094 --> 19:22.960
Oh, my God!
Peter, are you okay?

19:22.962 --> 19:24.595
I'm down!
I'm down, Cleveland!

19:24.597 --> 19:26.931
Go on without me!
Save yourself!

19:26.933 --> 19:29.000
No, I won't leave you.

We started this race together,
we're gonna finish it together.

Oh, my God, Peter.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.679
I-I can't pick you up.

19:41.681 --> 19:42.780
How much do you weigh?

19:42.782 --> 19:43.948
I don't know.

19:43.950 --> 19:45.983
My car can't go
up hills, though.

19:45.985 --> 19:48.519
Well, then there's
only one solution.

Hug and roll!

Boy, those fools
sure do love each other.

19:58.131 --> 19:59.964
Yeah, I...
I guess they do.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.499
You know, Donna, they've
known each other

20:01.501 --> 20:03.000
a lot longer than we have.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.135
That's true.

20:04.137 --> 20:05.636
And if we're gonna be neighbors,

20:05.638 --> 20:08.973
we're gonna have to learn to
set aside our differences.

20:08.975 --> 20:10.041
Friends?

20:10.043 --> 20:12.310
Friends.

20:12.312 --> 20:14.178
Mrs. Brown?

20:14.180 --> 20:16.981
I want you
to spank me again.

20:16.983 --> 20:19.016
CLEVELAND: We're gonna win!
We're gonna win!

MAN:
Not so fast.

Damn it!

20:35.701 --> 20:37.201
You know, Cleveland,
I got to say,

20:37.203 --> 20:39.870
it's great having the old gang
back together again.

20:39.872 --> 20:41.505
Well, it's great
being back.

20:41.507 --> 20:42.506

You know,
not a single person

20:48.414 --> 20:51.716
stopped watching
'cause you left.

20:51.718 --> 20:54.785
He doesn't have the guts
to say anything back.
