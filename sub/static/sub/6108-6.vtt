(Gasps)

00:22.598 --> 00:25.133
We are the horns
of the Increate.

00:25.167 --> 00:27.502
We shall not fear
the speaker of lies.

00:32.508 --> 00:33.808
Argh!

00:36.345 --> 00:38.280
We shall not be deceived.

00:38.814 --> 00:41.616
We are one. We shall not...

00:43.152 --> 00:45.186
(Heavy breathing)

00:51.594 --> 00:54.663
(Screams)

00:56.332 --> 00:57.832
(Low growling)

00:57.867 --> 01:00.168
Why have I been forsaken?

01:00.202 --> 01:05.373
You are the Monster of Italy.

01:07.510 --> 01:12.514
Everyone is hunting for you.

01:12.548 --> 01:14.349
Why?

01:14.383 --> 01:18.553
They want to kill you.

01:20.656 --> 01:22.557
But I...

01:24.560 --> 01:27.329
I... I...

01:27.363 --> 01:28.897
want...

01:29.165 --> 01:30.532
(Gasping)

01:31.500 --> 01:33.168
Argh!

01:33.202 --> 01:35.403
(Wheezing breaths)

01:39.175 --> 01:41.376
But I want to cure you.

(Gentle clatter
in background)

02:57.285 --> 02:59.386
(Chains rattle)

03:01.790 --> 03:04.058
Have you lost your mind?

03:09.130 --> 03:12.066
That's the first lucid thing
you've said for hours.

03:14.302 --> 03:18.105
Yet it is strangely
comforting to know

03:18.139 --> 03:20.307
my old rival's
still in there.

03:23.311 --> 03:24.578
Somewhere.

03:24.613 --> 03:27.248
- Was I drugged?
- Sedated.

03:28.250 --> 03:29.750
You left me no choice.

03:29.784 --> 03:32.286
You were poisoned, as was I,
by the Labyrinth.

03:32.320 --> 03:34.655
But I'm working on
an antidote.

03:44.399 --> 03:46.667
Release me immediately.

03:48.570 --> 03:50.904
(Softly) No. I can't do that.

03:51.806 --> 03:54.074
It's for your own safety.

03:55.477 --> 03:58.612
- And the safety of Florence.
- I am no longer your enemy.

03:58.647 --> 04:00.614
How many times
must I prove it to you?

04:00.649 --> 04:03.651
You are at one
with the Labyrinth.

04:06.121 --> 04:09.723
Leonardo...
what are you speaking of?

04:09.758 --> 04:12.393
I speak of your lies.

04:12.427 --> 04:14.795
I speak of your Labyrinth.

04:16.464 --> 04:18.464
Of... Of the...

04:18.533 --> 04:20.767
the damned Sons of Mithras.

04:22.237 --> 04:24.471
I'm speaking of the Turks.

04:24.539 --> 04:27.608
Of the so-called Pope Sixtus.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.777
Of any and all who demand
blind allegiance

04:29.811 --> 04:33.447
whilst at the same time claiming
the name of God as license to destroy.

04:33.515 --> 04:36.050
A God that I'm not
even sure exists.

04:38.353 --> 04:40.621
But if he does...

04:41.790 --> 04:45.626
..he would be horrified at what's
being perpetrated in his image.

04:47.696 --> 04:49.730
(Bell tolling in distance)

05:15.790 --> 05:18.425
I feel your loss, Signorina.

05:18.460 --> 05:22.596
I know Captain Dragonetti
was a wise and powerful ally of yours.

05:22.630 --> 05:25.566
But the Turks will continue
to spread terror

05:25.600 --> 05:27.735
unless we fight back.

05:28.737 --> 05:30.270
We must be united.

05:30.305 --> 05:33.540
Florence is honoring
her obligation to host the festival.

05:34.476 --> 05:36.643
But that is the extent
of our commitment.

05:42.784 --> 05:46.086
We live dangerous lives,
in dangerous times.

05:46.654 --> 05:48.889
To survive, you need allies.

05:49.657 --> 05:53.293
Isolation will only ensure
Florence's destruction.

05:53.328 --> 05:56.897
You are in a position
of power, Signorina.

05:57.832 --> 05:59.466
I suggest you use it.

05:59.501 --> 06:03.137
No amount of money or power
can guarantee one's safety.

06:03.171 --> 06:05.806
In fact, the more I have,
the less safe I feel.

06:07.842 --> 06:13.113
All I want is for Giulio to
have a happy, peaceful life.

06:14.149 --> 06:16.417
There can be no peace...

06:16.451 --> 06:18.819
while others endure
such pain.

06:24.159 --> 06:28.328
As a mother, your life
is no longer your own.

06:29.197 --> 06:31.298
It belongs to your child.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.869
But you are also
the new Mother of Florence.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.674
Do not ignore your people.

06:42.677 --> 06:45.379
Let us take the fight
to the Turks...

06:45.447 --> 06:48.282
and drive them from
our happy home.

06:50.718 --> 06:52.820
(Grunts) Now, tell me...

06:52.854 --> 06:55.189
while I have you...

06:55.223 --> 06:57.791
do you believe in free will?

06:57.826 --> 07:00.327
Playing God,
are we now, Da Vinci?

07:00.361 --> 07:02.663
Well, a lesser God, maybe.

07:04.399 --> 07:08.469
But if I created something as diabolical
as a human being...

07:09.404 --> 07:12.706
..the last thing I'd do is give it the
power to choose between good and evil.

07:12.740 --> 07:14.641
Ah...

07:14.676 --> 07:18.712
Now, that...is the genius
of Our Lord.

07:19.881 --> 07:23.650
Unlike the bird in the sky
and the beast in the field,

07:23.685 --> 07:25.853
we must make a choice.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.556
Saint or sinner.

07:29.591 --> 07:34.695
Ah, so you are saying that we are
capable of both great deeds...

07:34.729 --> 07:36.530
and terrible acts?

07:36.564 --> 07:38.465
Mm-hm.

07:39.200 --> 07:42.369
And you clearly believe
I've made the darker choice.

07:42.403 --> 07:46.473
Again, I ask...
What do you accuse me of?

07:46.508 --> 07:48.809
Well, my current theory

07:48.843 --> 07:52.880
is that you have become
the physical manifestation

07:52.914 --> 07:55.482
of man's eternal
inner struggle

07:55.517 --> 07:57.985
between good and evil.

07:59.420 --> 08:02.589
You see, one part of you
seeks piety.

08:04.926 --> 08:07.261
- The other's a killer.
- (Laughs)

08:08.663 --> 08:10.597
I'm the physical...

08:10.665 --> 08:12.366
(Riario laughing)

08:13.434 --> 08:15.569
Mm. And um...

08:17.238 --> 08:18.672
..who do you claim
I've killed?

08:18.706 --> 08:21.241
Well, in Rome...

08:21.276 --> 08:23.377
Cardinal Rodrigo.

08:24.779 --> 08:27.347
And the poor
bathhouse proprietor.

08:27.382 --> 08:29.383
And Clarice Orsini.

08:30.251 --> 08:33.620
And in Florence, Captain Dragonetti
of the Officers of the Night.

08:34.956 --> 08:36.690
I... I didn't.

08:36.724 --> 08:40.027
You are the killer
I described.

08:40.260 --> 08:42.429
The pious man...

08:42.462 --> 08:44.731
who kills with regret...

08:44.766 --> 08:48.969
and then exhibits his victims
as works of religious art.

08:49.037 --> 08:51.605
(Breathes nervously)

08:51.639 --> 08:53.774
(Riario whispers) Oh, my God.

08:53.808 --> 08:55.409
Wh...

08:58.646 --> 09:00.080
Why?

09:00.648 --> 09:02.783
Why have I done this?

09:02.817 --> 09:04.418
Uh...

09:05.453 --> 09:07.788
For the glory
of the Labyrinth, I suppose.

09:07.822 --> 09:09.423
No, no, no. I...

09:09.457 --> 09:11.625
I have never killed
at their behest.

09:12.727 --> 09:15.095
No, the Labyrinth
seeks to make all men pious

09:15.129 --> 09:17.731
to be of one mind before God.

09:17.765 --> 09:20.100
You see?

09:20.134 --> 09:21.902
Faith...

09:23.938 --> 09:25.906
..somehow...

09:26.908 --> 09:28.942
..has made you a sinner.

09:31.613 --> 09:34.348
The Architect said...

09:34.415 --> 09:36.683
resistance can take
many forms.

09:37.518 --> 09:40.687
When I... When I was under
their influence...

09:42.590 --> 09:45.092
..I made touch with an...

09:45.994 --> 09:48.996
..another...another world,
another reality...

09:50.632 --> 09:52.766
..born of my resistance.

09:54.702 --> 09:58.005
But yours...
yours was different.

09:58.039 --> 10:00.974
'Cause it caused you
to act out...

10:02.844 --> 10:04.444
..to kill.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.979
I...

10:06.014 --> 10:07.781
I...

10:07.815 --> 10:10.984
I have doubted
their instruction.

10:12.520 --> 10:15.155
I have questioned
their motives. I...

10:15.189 --> 10:16.790
I've re...

10:19.160 --> 10:21.395
I am not one.

10:23.631 --> 10:25.632
I never was.

10:26.734 --> 10:30.537
My heart...
must be so black...

10:31.572 --> 10:34.975
..my soul so riven
with cruelty...

10:36.711 --> 10:39.012
..I cannot be saved.

10:39.914 --> 10:43.984
Well, you saved me.
Didn't you?

10:47.755 --> 10:50.190
After all we'd been through,
I...

10:53.661 --> 10:56.163
..I could not watch you die.

10:59.701 --> 11:01.702
Well...

11:02.737 --> 11:06.039
Then the Riario I know...

11:07.108 --> 11:09.209
..is still in there.

11:09.243 --> 11:11.445
There's still time.

11:11.512 --> 11:13.046
I can heal you.

11:13.948 --> 11:16.183
Body and soul.

11:16.951 --> 11:19.553
We can eliminate the sinner.

11:27.028 --> 11:29.229
(Gasps and growls)

11:31.933 --> 11:34.868
(Deep voice) I will not be
so easy to dispatch,

11:34.902 --> 11:37.204
you sick son of a whore.

11:37.872 --> 11:39.606
I don't want to harm you.

11:39.640 --> 11:42.042
- I want to help you.
- (Laughs)

11:43.211 --> 11:46.713
Your help is to blame
for all this.

11:47.715 --> 11:50.717
You infected him with your
enlightened ideas

11:50.752 --> 11:53.220
and introduced him
to guilt, shame, remorse.

11:54.288 --> 11:56.723
Riddled him with confusion.

11:58.292 --> 12:03.764
I refuse to suffer
his pathetic whimpering any longer.

12:05.333 --> 12:08.668
I will crush
this worm inside me,

12:08.736 --> 12:12.272
then wring the sacred life
out of your damned throat,

12:12.507 --> 12:14.775
Leonardo Da Vinci.

12:16.978 --> 12:18.011
(Snarls)

12:18.079 --> 12:19.980
(Birdsong)

12:20.014 --> 12:23.083
Yes... (Sobbing)
I understand.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.086
I promise.

12:26.120 --> 12:28.588
- Yes, I'll tell her.
- Sophia?

12:29.624 --> 12:31.825
Oh. I'm sorry. I woke you.

12:31.859 --> 12:34.261
No, it's fine.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.630
Who were you talking to?

12:39.267 --> 12:42.102
I was talking to my mother.

12:45.706 --> 12:47.841
I sound a bit mad, but...

12:48.976 --> 12:50.977
..sometimes
she appears to me.

12:52.280 --> 12:54.281
Doesn't sound mad.

12:55.983 --> 12:57.884
- When did she...?
- Oh, she's not dead.

12:59.053 --> 13:00.187
She's...

13:01.222 --> 13:03.223
I'm not entirely sure.

13:05.893 --> 13:07.994
I... I can't
actually see her.

13:09.831 --> 13:12.799
She speaks to me, in my mind.

13:23.911 --> 13:25.812
(Whispers) Here.

13:26.147 --> 13:27.881
Come here.

13:29.917 --> 13:32.018
Get some sleep.

13:32.053 --> 13:33.887
You don't believe me.

13:33.921 --> 13:35.388
I do believe you.

13:35.656 --> 13:37.657
What does she say?

13:39.193 --> 13:41.194
She had a message.

13:42.997 --> 13:44.998
For you.

13:45.032 --> 13:47.234
She said you must
take me to him.

13:47.268 --> 13:49.903
To Leonardo Da Vinci.

13:52.907 --> 13:54.941
(Dramatic music)

14:05.219 --> 14:08.922
The essence of poison arrow
frog venom.

14:17.031 --> 14:19.733
(Coughs)
Oh, that's nasty stuff.

14:20.368 --> 14:22.369
If I add that to
the charcoal suspension,

14:22.403 --> 14:24.437
that should speed
the process.

14:24.472 --> 14:27.073
He admires you, you know.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.444
The worm inside me.

14:34.782 --> 14:37.250
He envies your conviction.

14:37.285 --> 14:41.054
The, uh, the ease with which
you make your choices.

14:42.423 --> 14:45.258
But I see through you,
Da Vinci.

14:47.995 --> 14:52.165
I know your conviction
is hollow.

14:54.435 --> 14:57.304
Your passion hides your fear.

14:57.338 --> 15:00.941
Your fear that you have
already lost your struggle.

15:00.975 --> 15:02.342
Shall I elaborate?

15:02.410 --> 15:03.944
Please.

15:07.114 --> 15:10.016
I think you'd appreciate
a righteous kill,

15:10.084 --> 15:14.354
enjoy the sight of
a gutted soul, still alive...

15:15.923 --> 15:18.491
..heart beating...

15:18.526 --> 15:21.127
lungs inflating...

15:22.496 --> 15:24.998
..and deflating.

15:25.032 --> 15:28.335
Then, as the blood spills,
the rhythm eases,

15:28.369 --> 15:29.970
death rattles...

15:30.538 --> 15:33.506
..and for their last
living act on earth,

15:33.774 --> 15:35.442
the sinners...

15:36.377 --> 15:38.178
..they shit their pants.

15:38.212 --> 15:40.280
(Wheezing laugh)

15:41.148 --> 15:43.817
(Makes farting sound)

15:46.387 --> 15:49.823
Even your beloved
Clarice Orsini.

15:54.362 --> 15:56.830
I released her...

15:56.864 --> 16:00.166
with the sweet cut
of my blade.

16:00.201 --> 16:01.901
(Swooshing)

16:07.508 --> 16:09.542
That was lovely.

16:12.146 --> 16:15.482
Sadly, you'll be gone
soon enough.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.884
The one, as you call him,
will survive.

16:17.918 --> 16:20.353
- Uh-oh. I hear doubt
in your voice.

16:21.389 --> 16:24.824
You know I'm too strong
to be erased by alchemy.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.893
I will die
when the worm does,

16:26.927 --> 16:30.864
in a pool of our own shit.

16:30.898 --> 16:33.566
It's an aberration
of the mind.

16:37.204 --> 16:39.539
You know,
you're nothing more.

16:39.573 --> 16:42.876
You're a product of...
some twisted chemistry.

16:42.910 --> 16:45.078
Are you afraid of the truth,
Da Vinci?

16:45.112 --> 16:47.047
- Am I too much...
- No.

16:47.081 --> 16:49.916
..the dark mirror
to your own war within?

16:49.950 --> 16:53.620
I never fear the truth.
Even from the mouth of liars.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.889
Oh, well, let's get
to the truth, then.

16:56.924 --> 16:59.559
What did you learn
from Otranto?

17:06.467 --> 17:08.101
(Sighs)

17:13.941 --> 17:18.278
I designed defensive weapons,
to protect Florence.

17:18.311 --> 17:20.213
Shh.

17:21.982 --> 17:23.950
Truth, Da Vinci.

17:25.319 --> 17:27.454
Leonardo...

17:27.488 --> 17:29.089
Can I call you Leo?

17:30.958 --> 17:33.259
Did you um...

17:33.294 --> 17:37.597
Did you secretly relish
the sight of your creations

17:37.631 --> 17:39.599
doing what you
designed them for?

17:39.633 --> 17:42.435
Killing. Slaughtering.
Maiming.

17:43.437 --> 17:48.141
A bombard has no morality,
no motive.

17:48.175 --> 17:51.611
It is simply a tool
designed for a purpose.

17:51.645 --> 17:55.315
- My weapons were stolen.
- Your designs, nevertheless.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.986
Tell me, what...

18:00.020 --> 18:04.324
What manner of man
can dream up such...

18:04.358 --> 18:07.527
efficient devices
of mass murder?

18:08.529 --> 18:13.666
Remember, it was the worm who first
recognized your genius for destruction.

18:13.701 --> 18:16.136
Men like us...

18:17.171 --> 18:20.173
..our inspiration comes
not from heaven.

18:22.510 --> 18:26.012
We do the Devil's work.

18:27.948 --> 18:31.017
- (Wheezing laughter)
- We are hardly the same.

18:31.051 --> 18:32.652
- You said we were.
- When?

18:32.686 --> 18:37.657
You said you saw in my work
the soul of an artist.

18:38.526 --> 18:41.361
A kindred spirit, like you.

18:42.396 --> 18:44.664
Only...

18:44.698 --> 18:47.200
I... I am a mere apprentice.

18:47.234 --> 18:48.701
I... I kill only the few.

18:48.736 --> 18:52.238
You... You are the master,
Da Vinci.

18:52.706 --> 18:55.041
You kill the many.

18:55.576 --> 19:01.181
You are the true
Monster of Italy.

19:02.249 --> 19:05.051
And I know what drew you
to Otranto.

19:05.085 --> 19:07.554
The hunt for Carlo de'Medici,

19:07.588 --> 19:10.757
the bastard who slew your
beloved mentor, Verrocchio,

19:10.824 --> 19:12.725
right here
before your very eyes.

19:14.828 --> 19:16.596
- (Softly) I sought justice.
- Oh...

19:16.664 --> 19:18.398
(Rattling at door)

19:18.432 --> 19:20.733
- (Knocking)
- What?

19:20.768 --> 19:22.669
- So you've heard, then?
- Heard what?

19:24.071 --> 19:25.772
Monster of Italy's
come to Florence.

19:25.839 --> 19:28.841
- Everyone's locking their doors.
- Yes. Yeah.

19:28.876 --> 19:32.579
Hello. I thought we were going to Wallachia
to find answers about the armor.

19:32.613 --> 19:35.715
- No. I don't need you today.
- Is that your lover?

19:35.749 --> 19:38.718
- What?
- Has he come for his morning knob slob?

19:38.752 --> 19:40.620
(Slurps and laughs)

19:40.688 --> 19:42.388
(Cackling)

19:42.423 --> 19:44.190
Who the fuck is that?

19:44.225 --> 19:45.758
(Sighs) Oh...

19:49.363 --> 19:51.431
(Laughing)

19:59.640 --> 20:01.441
Oh, tell him.
Tell him, Da Vinci.

20:01.475 --> 20:04.210
Tell your mongrel bitch
of my artistry.

20:04.245 --> 20:07.447
Oh, then he can claim the bounty
that is undoubtedly on my head,

20:07.481 --> 20:09.282
and have the wherewithal
to...

20:09.316 --> 20:11.651
(Laughing)

20:14.455 --> 20:16.623
Tell him, Da Vinci.

20:16.657 --> 20:19.892
Unlike you,
I can face the truth.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.462
Leo, what the hell
are you doing?

20:23.430 --> 20:26.399
Tell him, Artista.
Tell them all.

20:31.272 --> 20:33.306
(Grunts softly)

20:34.441 --> 20:36.776
(Heavy breathing)

20:39.313 --> 20:41.881
Riario's the Monster
of Italy.

20:41.915 --> 20:44.617
He killed Clarice
and Dragonetti.

20:47.588 --> 20:49.555
But it's not his fault.

20:49.590 --> 20:51.324
He's ill.

20:51.392 --> 20:53.493
I'm curing him.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.597
- (Shouting)
- Kill him!

20:57.631 --> 20:59.799
Kill the foreign scum!

20:59.833 --> 21:01.434
Kill! Kill the Monster!

21:02.670 --> 21:05.171
- He killed our Captain!
- It's chaos.

21:05.239 --> 21:07.240
(Shouting continues outside)

21:09.810 --> 21:12.645
You demanded the Captain's
killer dead or alive.

21:12.680 --> 21:15.348
- What did you expect, Signorina?
- I expected justice.

21:15.416 --> 21:19.319
And you would have had it
if not for your beloved Artista.

21:19.353 --> 21:20.953
He let the killer escape
his grasp.

21:21.188 --> 21:23.656
Crusade festival
is soon upon us.

21:24.625 --> 21:26.959
Dignitaries from around Italy
will not stay long

21:27.194 --> 21:29.495
in a city rife with turmoil.

21:29.530 --> 21:33.166
It would be an embarrassment to Florence.
One not soon forgotten.

21:33.200 --> 21:36.536
I appreciate your concern
for our reputation, Signora Cereta.

21:36.603 --> 21:39.505
The Officers of the Night
want revenge, not justice.

21:39.540 --> 21:41.941
Their Captain was murdered and they
won't stop until they find the killer.

21:41.975 --> 21:43.876
And what do you suggest?

21:45.379 --> 21:48.815
They need a new Captain.
Let's give them one.

21:48.849 --> 21:52.285
I suggest our new councilwoman nominates
one of her associates.

21:52.319 --> 21:55.788
If the Turks can get to Dragonetti,
they can get to anyone.

21:55.823 --> 21:57.724
You and Giulio
must be protected.

21:57.791 --> 22:01.461
My men can ensure your family
and city that protection.

22:11.538 --> 22:14.507
This treatment should,
in time,

22:14.541 --> 22:17.477
revert him back
to the old Riario.

22:17.511 --> 22:19.712
I say we excise both of them.

22:21.382 --> 22:23.483
(Gasping)

22:33.394 --> 22:36.362
(Softly) I had...terrifying
nightmares.

22:38.966 --> 22:41.901
But waking up
to face this reality is...

22:44.004 --> 22:45.905
..is far, far worse.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.675
How could I do
such terrible things?

22:50.577 --> 22:54.013
- You really don't remember.
- No.

22:55.048 --> 22:58.351
But when Leonardo told me,
I...

23:00.854 --> 23:03.356
..I knew in my heart
he was correct.

23:03.991 --> 23:06.893
Sorry, I'm struggling.
When he...

23:06.927 --> 23:09.896
When he told you
you were a monster...

23:09.930 --> 23:13.032
who wasn't a monster, because you
didn't know you were a monster...

23:13.267 --> 23:15.568
Zo, he's...
He's not responsible.

23:15.602 --> 23:18.905
It was a consequence of
the Labyrinth conditioning.

23:18.939 --> 23:21.841
His mind couldn't handle it.
It broke in two.

23:21.875 --> 23:24.343
I think because he was
already compromised.

23:24.378 --> 23:26.712
Compromised? W...

23:27.781 --> 23:30.416
When you were in
the New World,

23:30.451 --> 23:32.518
you spoke of your first kill.

23:34.588 --> 23:36.055
Your mother.

23:36.957 --> 23:39.959
'Strangled at your own hand,
orchestrated by your father.'

23:40.794 --> 23:43.629
Perhaps you rejected
the Labyrinth's conditioning

23:43.697 --> 23:46.899
because your psyche
was already fractured.

23:46.934 --> 23:49.068
Then there is no hope for me.

23:51.071 --> 23:52.738
Your cure will not work.

23:54.475 --> 23:56.809
No, I can...
I can flush the toxins.

23:56.877 --> 23:59.812
I can heal your body,
but I just...

23:59.880 --> 24:01.781
(Sighs)

24:01.815 --> 24:05.585
Well, we may need to find
another solution for the mind.

24:05.619 --> 24:08.054
To release you from
this internal struggle.

24:08.088 --> 24:10.089
To wake you up.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.626
As I had to...

24:13.660 --> 24:15.461
- in my alternate reality.
- Mm-hm.

24:15.496 --> 24:17.964
That's great,
uh, fascinating, really.

24:17.998 --> 24:21.634
May I remind you that everyone in
Florence is hunting this man right now.

24:22.336 --> 24:23.803
Listen, they want him dead.

24:23.871 --> 24:26.072
Well, we can't let
that happen.

24:27.975 --> 24:30.710
I need him. The...

24:30.744 --> 24:33.613
- Crusade needs him.
- We don't have much time.

24:33.647 --> 24:36.315
His Holiness
is coming to Florence.

24:36.383 --> 24:38.484
Pope Sixtus?

24:39.653 --> 24:40.374
In Florence?

24:40.398 --> 24:42.923
To secure the allegiance
of the city states.

24:44.057 --> 24:46.459
- To launch his Crusade.
- When?

24:46.493 --> 24:48.494
For the Pageant of Arms.

24:48.562 --> 24:50.763
To see the demonstration
of your weapon.

24:50.797 --> 24:55.401
When His Holiness learns that
the Vatican killer is here in Florence...

24:55.435 --> 24:57.937
He will retreat and his
Crusade will fall apart

24:57.971 --> 24:59.805
and the Turks
will overrun Italy.

24:59.840 --> 25:02.141
(Chains rattling)

25:05.512 --> 25:06.946
You know what you must do?

25:06.980 --> 25:10.650
Tell the truth.
Deliver me to the Council...

25:10.684 --> 25:12.785
And collect the bounty.
Sounds like a good plan to me.

25:12.819 --> 25:16.088
No. Riario is the face of the Crusade.
It would never survive the revelation.

25:16.123 --> 25:19.659
Please, Leonardo.
Let me pay for my sins.

25:21.461 --> 25:23.629
Let my death serve Italy.

25:26.066 --> 25:28.467
No. No, that won't
be necessary.

25:31.638 --> 25:33.105
I have a plan.

25:33.140 --> 25:36.676
But...we will need help.

25:36.743 --> 25:38.978
- Help?
- We can't give them Riario.

25:39.012 --> 25:42.748
But we can deliver a monster
to the people of Florence.

25:44.017 --> 25:45.952
And Nico's gonna catch him.

25:51.425 --> 25:53.459
(Fire crackling)

25:55.529 --> 25:58.598
Hey, little one. It's okay.

26:05.005 --> 26:06.606
What's happening?

26:06.640 --> 26:09.108
My men have cornered the
killer outside the palace.

26:09.977 --> 26:12.445
And your little prince
is leading the charge.

26:12.479 --> 26:13.879
- Nico?
- (Shouting outside)

26:20.721 --> 26:23.556
- (Shouting continues)
- There he is!

26:23.624 --> 26:25.658
(Shouting in background)

26:44.811 --> 26:45.978
(Grunts)

26:46.647 --> 26:48.080
(Groans)

26:49.583 --> 26:51.517
(Groaning)

26:57.491 --> 26:59.025
(Body thuds)

26:59.059 --> 27:01.127
(Panting)

27:02.796 --> 27:05.665
Ah. Oh, shit, that was close.

27:07.134 --> 27:09.035
(Cheering and applause)

27:18.679 --> 27:20.713
(Rattling)

27:20.747 --> 27:22.815
(Water running nearby)

27:26.486 --> 27:28.587
(Clang)

27:35.595 --> 27:37.029
How long was I asleep?

27:37.064 --> 27:38.864
The day has come and gone.

27:38.899 --> 27:41.100
Night has fallen?

27:41.168 --> 27:43.202
- He's coming.
- No. Wait.

27:43.236 --> 27:44.837
Listen to me.
Look at me.

27:44.871 --> 27:46.706
- Look at me. Look at me.
- (Whimpers)

27:46.740 --> 27:48.574
I need you to listen to me
for a minute.

27:48.709 --> 27:52.678
What you told me last night that your
mother said, the message, I know him.

27:52.713 --> 27:55.581
- What?
- Da Vinci. I know him.

27:55.615 --> 27:58.184
I'm not sure what it means,
but...

27:58.218 --> 27:59.852
but...

27:59.886 --> 28:02.254
I think the person
that Lupo's looking for...

28:03.290 --> 28:05.758
- I think it might be you.
- (Thudding above)

28:05.792 --> 28:08.761
He's going to take you. But I swear
to God I won't let him hurt you.

28:08.795 --> 28:10.696
- I swear.
- (Barking)

28:10.731 --> 28:12.698
You've got to trust me.
Can you do that?

28:13.800 --> 28:17.570
I have a way of getting us out of here.
I have a plan. I have a plan.

28:17.604 --> 28:20.706
- (Rattling)
- You know how this works.

28:20.741 --> 28:22.808
Not you.

28:27.948 --> 28:29.648
(Barking)

28:43.897 --> 28:46.065
(Whimpering)

28:48.702 --> 28:50.736
(Barking)

29:04.284 --> 29:06.118
(Clunk)

29:07.154 --> 29:09.221
(Whispering)

29:16.263 --> 29:17.997
Tell me this is
your good side.

29:24.004 --> 29:25.771
Good.

29:30.343 --> 29:32.945
Oh, the serum appears
to be holding.

29:33.613 --> 29:35.181
You are due another dose.

29:38.685 --> 29:41.687
What I still fail to grasp
is my true motive.

29:43.323 --> 29:46.158
Cardinal Rodrigo
was a man of the cloth.

29:46.193 --> 29:48.360
I had no quarrel with him.

29:49.663 --> 29:51.797
Well, perhaps you did.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.100
When you returned
to the Vatican,

29:55.135 --> 29:57.670
you found Cardinal Rodrigo

29:57.704 --> 29:59.672
in place at the Pope's
right hand.

29:59.706 --> 30:02.107
I confess I...

30:02.142 --> 30:05.144
I felt somewhat threatened
by their alliance. Yes.

30:05.178 --> 30:06.615
Clarice was hunting Carlo.

30:06.639 --> 30:08.480
That was a threat
to your new-found faith.

30:08.481 --> 30:12.384
And Captain Dragonetti
was vehemently against your Crusade.

30:15.055 --> 30:16.689
Your saint was threatened,

30:16.723 --> 30:19.158
retreated into
a nightmare world,

30:19.192 --> 30:21.327
and let your sinner
reign free.

30:28.735 --> 30:30.669
(Dramatic music)

30:31.171 --> 30:33.205
Are you ready?

30:33.240 --> 30:34.340
Mm.

30:40.080 --> 30:41.413
(Exhales)

30:43.083 --> 30:45.084
(Rattling)

30:52.926 --> 30:54.994
(Chains rattling)

31:02.035 --> 31:04.904
I have no desire to hurt you.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.877
- He, on the other hand...
- (Dog growls)

31:14.414 --> 31:16.148
The Page...

31:16.182 --> 31:19.351
showed me your convent.

31:19.386 --> 31:22.021
It showed me you.

31:22.055 --> 31:24.089
(Sobbing)

31:25.358 --> 31:27.860
(Whispers) I cannot
decipher it.

31:28.762 --> 31:31.363
I'm certain
that one of you can.

31:33.066 --> 31:35.200
And you're the only one left.

31:37.170 --> 31:39.204
(Lupo sighs)

31:49.416 --> 31:52.918
Tell me...its secrets...

31:55.789 --> 31:59.058
..and no harm
will come to you.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.529
(Eerie music)

32:14.741 --> 32:17.409
If I'd known, I'd never have agreed
to host the presentation.

32:17.444 --> 32:20.079
That's exactly why we were
kept in the dark.

32:20.113 --> 32:22.114
(Thud as doors open)

32:31.124 --> 32:32.424
(Clears his throat)

32:40.133 --> 32:43.002
Your Holiness.
May I introduce...

32:43.069 --> 32:45.471
Signorina Moschella.

32:50.143 --> 32:55.347
I expected Count Riario
among my welcomers.

32:55.415 --> 32:58.484
He sent word.
Did you not receive it?

32:58.518 --> 33:01.854
He's back in Rome, gathering troops
for the Condottieri Legion.

33:01.921 --> 33:05.624
A legion which still does
not include Florentines.

33:08.128 --> 33:10.195
It's a pity how shortsighted
a city can be

33:10.263 --> 33:13.999
after so recently suffering
excommunication...

33:14.034 --> 33:17.302
cut off from
the rest of the country...

33:17.337 --> 33:19.505
no assurance of safety.

33:20.974 --> 33:23.375
Well, try as you might
to threaten us,

33:23.443 --> 33:25.511
I assure you there is
nothing Rome can provide

33:25.545 --> 33:27.513
that we cannot
provide ourselves.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.281
Mm.

33:29.315 --> 33:31.316
(Clears his throat)

33:35.522 --> 33:40.192
I hear your men captured
a brutal killer today.

33:40.226 --> 33:42.861
- Yes, we...
- One man...

33:44.364 --> 33:47.199
..captured
with great difficulty.

33:50.136 --> 33:52.204
Imagine...

33:52.238 --> 33:54.673
when a horde of thousands

33:54.908 --> 33:59.578
of these same
ungodly heathens attack...

34:01.981 --> 34:03.982
..all at once.

34:04.017 --> 34:07.319
The Holy fist
of a unified Italy

34:07.353 --> 34:09.688
will crush our enemies.

34:11.190 --> 34:13.092
But if you do not join us,

34:13.159 --> 34:15.260
there would be no protection.

34:17.397 --> 34:19.565
My dear...

34:19.599 --> 34:24.203
would you rather your son
grew up to be ruler amongst the dead...

34:25.338 --> 34:27.505
..or amongst the living?

34:32.946 --> 34:36.114
Tell me what it says.

34:37.250 --> 34:39.518
I don't know.

34:39.552 --> 34:41.887
I'm sorry.

34:48.061 --> 34:51.196
- (Gasps) Wait!
- Tell me what it says!

34:52.132 --> 34:54.233
Wait.

34:54.266 --> 34:56.400
(Eerie music)

35:00.607 --> 35:01.640
Wait.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.714
I think...

35:08.748 --> 35:10.449
- What?
- (Growls and barks)

35:18.424 --> 35:21.126
If you run...

35:21.194 --> 35:23.562
he will find you.

35:26.132 --> 35:28.133
- (Barking)
- (She whimpers)

35:30.036 --> 35:31.370
(Barking)

35:45.618 --> 35:47.719
(Barking)

35:56.462 --> 35:58.430
(Barking)

36:01.634 --> 36:06.939
Why did you have to come
here, Lucrezia Donati?

36:08.308 --> 36:10.576
- (Lucrezia whispers) Lupo.
- (He groans)

36:13.446 --> 36:15.247
(Dog growling)

36:19.452 --> 36:21.420
(Sophia gasps)

36:23.957 --> 36:25.958
Is he...?

36:27.994 --> 36:30.095
You're safe now.

36:40.340 --> 36:42.574
Right. We're setting up
overlooking the Arno,

36:42.609 --> 36:45.477
so I need you to unfurl the sketches
and just hang them...

36:45.511 --> 36:47.646
Careful! Careful. Careful.

36:47.680 --> 36:49.648
Just...

36:54.020 --> 36:56.989
We... We will give you
quite the spectacle tonight, Signora.

36:57.023 --> 36:58.523
I think you will be
very pleased.

36:58.591 --> 37:00.659
All the spectacle
in the world is moot...

37:00.693 --> 37:02.427
if the Crusade
lacks leadership.

37:02.462 --> 37:06.164
I'm at my wits' end.
Where could Count Riario be?

37:06.199 --> 37:07.599
I fear the worst.

37:07.634 --> 37:10.102
The monster has been
vanquished, so...

37:10.136 --> 37:11.670
the Count's in no danger.

37:11.704 --> 37:13.705
Every time
an Officer appears,

37:13.773 --> 37:17.442
I expect to hear they've found
Girolamo's body crucified.

37:19.178 --> 37:20.679
Oh.

37:20.713 --> 37:24.182
Riario is a warrior at heart.

37:24.217 --> 37:27.185
It would take more than an
Ottoman assassin to stop him.

37:29.188 --> 37:31.056
- Would you excuse me?
- Of course.

37:32.458 --> 37:34.793
No, no! What are you doing?
That's upside down!

37:35.061 --> 37:37.129
(Fireworks exploding)

37:42.335 --> 37:44.703
[MAN] Open up! Come on!

37:44.737 --> 37:46.672
- Shit!
- Oi!

37:46.706 --> 37:48.707
Open up in there!

37:48.741 --> 37:50.809
On the orders of
the Doge of Venice,

37:50.843 --> 37:53.378
we are looking for
Count Riario.

37:54.647 --> 37:56.248
- Shh.
- (Knocking and shouting)

37:56.316 --> 37:58.050
Open up!

37:59.686 --> 38:02.854
- Get up! Open the door now!
- Quiet.

38:04.424 --> 38:06.525
- Open the door!
- Don't...

38:07.293 --> 38:08.549
..he ...  about it.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.530
(Screams)

38:11.564 --> 38:13.532
- Up here! Follow me!
- Help!

38:13.566 --> 38:15.534
They're gonna murder me!

38:15.568 --> 38:18.103
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
(Groaning)

38:18.538 --> 38:20.706
Release me from this bondage.

38:23.276 --> 38:25.010
Don't.

38:25.044 --> 38:26.511
(Rattling)

38:31.551 --> 38:33.051
Argh!

38:33.119 --> 38:35.020
(Grunting)

38:46.399 --> 38:48.633
(Groaning)

38:53.506 --> 38:55.040
(Yells)

39:00.179 --> 39:02.347
(Groaning)

39:05.551 --> 39:07.252
Oh, f...

39:08.221 --> 39:10.188
Ah... Oh!

39:13.693 --> 39:15.694
Jesus!

39:19.766 --> 39:21.433
Oh, fuck.

39:22.769 --> 39:24.770
(Fireworks exploding)

39:26.539 --> 39:29.508
Gentlemen, this is a cannon
I will be demonstrating

39:29.542 --> 39:31.676
at tonight's Pageant of Arms.

39:31.711 --> 39:34.246
Now, this is just
a prototype.

39:34.280 --> 39:37.516
The model we take into battle
will be of a still larger caliber.

39:37.550 --> 39:39.518
What lies in this chamber?

39:41.521 --> 39:44.856
It's an acidic substance.
It's designed to weaken the Ottoman armor.

39:44.891 --> 39:48.593
On impact, the second chamber explodes,
penetrating further into the metal.

39:49.796 --> 39:54.399
It will leave only shrapnel
and vanquished enemies in its wake.

39:54.434 --> 39:57.536
The wrath of God
in a single, neat package.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.439
Indeed.

40:04.410 --> 40:06.745
We've heard of hellish
Turkish weapons.

40:06.779 --> 40:09.881
Exotic devices that spit fire
and are invincible.

40:11.284 --> 40:12.551
Girolamo!

40:12.585 --> 40:16.688
Yet you claim this weapon
will thwart them?

40:16.722 --> 40:17.889
Da Vinci!

40:18.124 --> 40:20.225
(Riario mutters)

40:20.259 --> 40:23.528
Look who has been returned
to us by the Grace of God.

40:23.563 --> 40:25.864
Yes. Uh...

40:27.200 --> 40:28.733
Where has the Count been?

40:28.768 --> 40:30.869
Oh, as I was telling
the Signora,

40:30.903 --> 40:33.271
I was gravely ill,

40:33.306 --> 40:36.241
being tended to
by a dear friend.

40:38.544 --> 40:40.912
I appear to have missed
all the fun.

40:40.947 --> 40:43.248
It seems to have affected
his eyes.

40:44.217 --> 40:47.419
Perhaps Da Vinci has encountered
such a phenomenon before.

40:47.453 --> 40:49.621
Yes. Come...

40:49.655 --> 40:52.624
Come back with me
to my studio.

40:52.658 --> 40:56.962
I may have a salve or a solution
that can help ease your pain.

40:56.996 --> 41:00.599
And miss your triumph,
Da Vinci? (Tuts)

41:14.680 --> 41:16.581
(Da Vinci sighs)
Oh, thank God.

41:16.616 --> 41:18.416
I feared the worst.

41:19.519 --> 41:22.320
- What happened?
- He's left your studio in quite a mess.

41:23.589 --> 41:25.624
Let's put it this way.
There's a lot of blood.

41:25.658 --> 41:28.260
Oh, he can't do much damage
here, not with all these people around.

41:28.294 --> 41:30.295
No, I wouldn't be so sure.

41:31.297 --> 41:34.633
The monster is acting out on
anyone who threatens Riario.

41:38.471 --> 41:39.938
Vanessa...

41:39.972 --> 41:41.940
Look, take her
somewhere safe.

41:41.974 --> 41:43.675
Just keep her close.

41:43.709 --> 41:45.477
And keep a sword closer.

41:45.511 --> 41:48.346
Signor Da Vinci,
your demonstration.

41:52.351 --> 41:54.319
Show time.

41:55.988 --> 41:58.023
(Chatter)

41:59.492 --> 42:02.060
The army of
the Ottoman Empire

42:02.328 --> 42:05.363
is the greatest
and most powerful

42:05.398 --> 42:07.499
this world has ever seen.

42:11.370 --> 42:14.339
Their engineering
is far advanced

42:14.373 --> 42:17.642
and their weapons
are second to none.

42:20.379 --> 42:22.814
Until...now.

42:25.918 --> 42:27.986
Load the warhead!

42:31.490 --> 42:32.991
Stand back.

42:33.025 --> 42:35.060
Please. Ladies and gentlemen,
stand back. Please.

42:35.094 --> 42:36.861
- Clear the way.
- Stand back, please.

42:39.432 --> 42:41.600
Loaded.

42:41.667 --> 42:43.568
Shame it doesn't
really work.

42:43.603 --> 42:45.403
No, it's all about the show.

42:45.438 --> 42:50.375
In the distance,
an Ottoman warship approaches.

42:56.082 --> 42:58.383
Light the fuse!

42:59.385 --> 43:01.419
(Fuse fizzing)

43:01.454 --> 43:03.555
(Suspenseful music)

43:16.702 --> 43:18.370
(Booming explosion)

43:18.404 --> 43:20.438
(Cheering and applause)

43:37.089 --> 43:39.591
(Muffled voice) Leo. Leo.

43:39.625 --> 43:41.426
Leo.

43:41.460 --> 43:43.662
Hey. I can't see him.

43:43.729 --> 43:45.630
Riario's gone.

43:45.665 --> 43:46.798
(Chatter)

43:48.467 --> 43:49.934
Oh...

43:57.476 --> 43:59.144
Take the south.
I'll head north.

44:04.750 --> 44:07.485
(Da Vinci mutters)

44:07.520 --> 44:09.154
Come on.

44:18.864 --> 44:20.765
Riario!

44:21.133 --> 44:22.934
Ah.

44:22.968 --> 44:25.170
The fellow artist.

44:25.438 --> 44:27.605
Come to critique my work.

44:28.174 --> 44:30.408
- (She whimpers)
- Oh, no, no, no, no!

44:30.443 --> 44:32.477
Wait, wait. Wait. Look.

44:35.614 --> 44:37.649
(Blade scraping)

44:41.754 --> 44:43.988
I've come to tell you
the truth.

44:45.925 --> 44:47.125
(She whimpers)

44:47.159 --> 44:49.160
I am like you.

44:58.504 --> 45:02.107
I, too, struggle with myself
more than any enemy.

45:05.911 --> 45:07.645
Let me tell you of Otranto.

45:07.680 --> 45:09.781
(Laura choking)

45:11.584 --> 45:13.785
As I walked through
the carnage...

45:14.754 --> 45:17.455
..through the smoke, the...

45:17.490 --> 45:19.624
blood and death...

45:21.927 --> 45:25.830
..for one ugly...
dark moment...

45:27.767 --> 45:29.768
..I reveled.

45:31.637 --> 45:33.204
In awe...

45:34.473 --> 45:35.874
..of my machines of death.

45:35.941 --> 45:37.509
The glorious bloodshed

45:37.543 --> 45:39.644
that my creations
had wrought.

45:45.651 --> 45:49.154
(Whispers) I hate that part
of myself...so much.

45:51.557 --> 45:55.059
I sometimes wish that
I could open up my veins...

45:56.162 --> 45:59.164
..and drain the evil
from myself.

46:02.067 --> 46:04.536
A very sad state.

46:05.237 --> 46:07.972
Yet, not like me at all.

46:08.007 --> 46:11.709
I wish only to express myself
through my chosen medium.

46:11.744 --> 46:12.652
No, no, no, Riario.
Don't, don't, don't, don't.

46:12.676 --> 46:14.179
(Ripping)

46:14.180 --> 46:15.814
(She gasps)

46:15.848 --> 46:17.882
Now...

46:17.917 --> 46:21.152
let me open her up for you.

46:21.187 --> 46:24.722
Show you her beating heart.

46:24.757 --> 46:27.725
No, no, no. That's not why
you want her to bleed, is it?

46:29.094 --> 46:31.563
She's tempting you.

46:32.198 --> 46:36.701
Isn't she? Her obvious affections,
they're stirring up feelings inside you.

46:36.735 --> 46:39.204
Feelings you have forbade
yourself to feel.

46:46.612 --> 46:48.613
She loves you...

46:51.083 --> 46:53.117
..as your own mother did.

46:54.954 --> 46:56.588
(Gasps)

46:56.622 --> 47:01.259
That's a love...you cannot
allow yourself to return.

47:02.261 --> 47:04.696
And that's why she must die.

47:04.730 --> 47:09.634
Because she reminds you
of the origins of your broken soul.

47:11.270 --> 47:13.705
Of what started it all.

47:13.739 --> 47:18.042
But you are too much
of a coward to face it,

47:18.077 --> 47:19.744
so go on, finish it.

47:20.646 --> 47:23.615
Finish it. Close the circle.

47:25.317 --> 47:27.585
But don't use a blade.
Use your hands.

47:27.620 --> 47:31.289
Strangle the life out of her,
like you did your own flesh and blood.

47:37.830 --> 47:39.931
Or...

47:42.601 --> 47:44.936
..you can choose.

47:46.272 --> 47:48.740
There's free will, Girolamo.

47:51.277 --> 47:54.646
You can choose to hide
in your nightmares...

47:55.981 --> 47:58.116
..as I did...

47:59.151 --> 48:03.254
..or you can choose
to wake up.

48:08.327 --> 48:10.828
Wake up.

48:14.900 --> 48:18.603
It is the only way
to defeat the sinner.

48:24.276 --> 48:26.644
Wake up.

48:27.947 --> 48:30.114
Wake up.

48:35.287 --> 48:37.121
(She gasps)

48:39.158 --> 48:40.925
(Weapon scrapes on floor)

48:57.309 --> 48:59.344
Lucrezia?

48:59.411 --> 49:01.245
Yes.

49:01.981 --> 49:04.749
Oh, we should get going. It's
a two-day ride to Florence.

49:04.783 --> 49:06.851
What's in Florence?

49:06.919 --> 49:09.754
- Leonardo Da Vinci.
- (Horse neighing)

49:09.788 --> 49:11.956
(Hoofbeats)

49:13.225 --> 49:15.326
Go! Get in the house!

49:18.897 --> 49:20.898
Do you know them?
Who are they?

49:22.668 --> 49:26.137
Okay, listen. I don't have much time
to explain but I need you to be brave.

49:26.171 --> 49:27.939
Why? Why?

49:27.973 --> 49:29.674
Here.

49:29.742 --> 49:32.643
Take this...and hide.

49:32.678 --> 49:34.679
Look at me. Look at me.

49:34.747 --> 49:36.179
Pick your moment and run.

49:36.180 --> 49:37.288
Bring this to Florence.

49:37.312 --> 49:39.398
I swear to you, Leo will be
there and he will help you.

49:40.019 --> 49:41.886
Okay.

49:42.755 --> 49:44.722
Go. Go.

50:01.073 --> 50:03.074
Out.

50:04.109 --> 50:06.077
Now.

50:10.215 --> 50:11.749
(He spits)

50:11.784 --> 50:13.818
(Horses whinnying)

50:26.331 --> 50:30.001
- Not surprised to see me?
- "The daughter will find the Page."

50:30.069 --> 50:32.970
Our soothsayer rarely
misses the mark.

50:33.005 --> 50:35.139
Well, she did this time.

50:38.010 --> 50:40.011
Find it.

50:49.955 --> 50:51.189
Start here.

50:55.427 --> 50:57.195
Where is Lupo Mercuri?

50:57.262 --> 51:00.865
He's here. All the parts
of him that his vile dog couldn't stomach.

51:01.500 --> 51:03.468
I know you came for the Page.

51:03.769 --> 51:06.437
I can only assume you intend
to use it against me.

51:13.045 --> 51:14.178
Look everywhere.

51:14.213 --> 51:16.848
You're right.
I would have.

51:16.882 --> 51:18.816
But the Page isn't here.

51:22.888 --> 51:27.325
It drove Lupo insane
and he destroyed it in front of my eyes.

51:42.074 --> 51:44.175
(Suspenseful music)

52:00.325 --> 52:03.060
Nothing.We will fin.

52:03.095 --> 52:04.896
With or without your help.

52:11.003 --> 52:13.104
(Instrumental music)
