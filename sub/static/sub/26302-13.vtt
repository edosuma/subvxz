WEBVTT

00:01.569 --> 00:03.737
The Lyons are
hitting back on Empire.

00:03.771 --> 00:06.174
- May we rise.
- Like we always do.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.076
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:08.109 --> 00:10.211
And check out
our other Fox programs...

00:10.244 --> 00:13.081
Star, 9-1-1, and The Resident.

00:13.114 --> 00:14.215
That's a win-win.

00:14.248 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.752 --> 00:20.530
- Previously on Empire...
- A dozen of Empire artists

00:20.554 --> 00:23.491
are going to embark
on a nationwide tour.

00:24.858 --> 00:26.026
We weren't even aware

00:26.060 --> 00:27.761
that Treasure
had representation.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.830
Treasure's been one of my girls
for a long time.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.099
I have cancer.

00:31.132 --> 00:33.567
Lymphoma. Stage IV. I'm dying.

00:33.601 --> 00:36.670
I'm a Lyon, and I'm done
apologizing for that.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.206
We are here for one thing,

00:38.239 --> 00:39.840
and that's
to get Empire's money back.

00:39.873 --> 00:42.276
I don't plan on chasing you.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.011
When you say
you want to make right

00:44.044 --> 00:45.546
the things we did wrong,

00:45.579 --> 00:47.748
I think that's a way
for us to retell our story.

00:52.420 --> 00:54.522
Wow.

00:54.555 --> 00:57.191
Wow, wow, wow.

01:03.264 --> 01:05.733
Man. I got to admit it,

01:05.766 --> 01:06.734
ladies, the song is fire.

01:06.767 --> 01:08.702
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.114
And that's just a taste
of what you gonna get

01:10.138 --> 01:11.405
on the Trust Tour, Angie.

01:11.439 --> 01:13.374
It's crazy that you call it
the Trust Tour

01:13.407 --> 01:15.109
because, I mean, you know,

01:15.143 --> 01:16.886
Empire's taken a bunch of hits
this past year,

01:16.910 --> 01:18.579
and, I-I mean,

01:18.612 --> 01:20.481
are you gonna be able
to pull that off?

01:20.514 --> 01:21.815
No one over at Empire,

01:21.849 --> 01:24.918
from top to bottom,
ever doubted this tour.

01:24.952 --> 01:26.620
We can't even get fans
to download music.

01:26.654 --> 01:28.289
A tour could be crippling.

01:28.322 --> 01:31.091
It's still the biggest risk
we've ever had to take, Lucious.

01:31.125 --> 01:33.227
Why you being so negative, baby?

01:33.261 --> 01:35.263
Not one speck of doubt.

01:35.296 --> 01:37.097
Well, like I said,
the song is fire.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.733
And you guys seem
to have squashed whatever beef

01:39.767 --> 01:41.178
- was happening here, so...
- There never was any.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.103
There was never any beef.

01:43.137 --> 01:44.281
That is my sister right there.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.339
Truth be told,

01:45.373 --> 01:46.607
these girls are fam, honey.

01:48.642 --> 01:50.511
Of course I'll do the tour.

01:50.544 --> 01:51.688
And feature Treasure
in your set?

01:51.712 --> 01:52.813
Who?

01:53.847 --> 01:55.949
Okay, I'll do it.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.485
But I don't want a feature.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.487
- I want my own set.
- Okay.

01:59.520 --> 02:01.431
You need to slow your roll.
See, you just got on the scene,

02:01.455 --> 02:03.090
- what, a minute ago?
- Deal.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.525
No. What? No deal.

02:04.558 --> 02:06.594
She ain't ready for all of that.

02:06.627 --> 02:08.929
Her duet is blowing up
all over the place,

02:08.961 --> 02:11.499
and we're not trying to leave
any money on the table.

02:11.532 --> 02:13.267
Okay?

02:13.301 --> 02:14.602
Sign.

02:14.635 --> 02:16.637
Thank you.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.872
So, you want me to go on tour
with Hakeem and Tiana?

02:20.140 --> 02:21.342
I don't know.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.976
That could go left real fast.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.845
Or it could go, so right.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.280
Hakeem has two videos to shoot,

02:26.314 --> 02:27.791
which means he won't be around
for half the time,

02:27.815 --> 02:29.883
leaving you plenty
of opportunity

02:29.917 --> 02:32.853
to, shall we say...
stake your claim?

02:34.000 --> 02:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:42.896 --> 02:44.665
Let me put some real flavor
on this tour.

02:44.698 --> 02:47.301
Well, look at
the "co-joneses" on Carlito.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.469
Okay.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.570
Come through, then.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.677
We're just one big, happy family
over at Empire.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.079
Can I just get to it
with you, Cookie?

02:59.112 --> 03:00.581
Go ahead. Shoot your shot, girl.

03:00.614 --> 03:04.318
All right, because you guys had
a massive data mining scandal,

03:04.352 --> 03:05.919
and everybody knows about it.

03:05.953 --> 03:09.156
So you're not worried that
the trust is gone for Empire?

03:09.189 --> 03:11.592
Look, I-I know we have
a lot of work to do, Angie.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.494
That's why we are pulling out
the big guns.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.363
Okay? In fact,

03:15.396 --> 03:18.999
this whole tour and this show,
everything, it's free.

03:19.032 --> 03:23.404
Because we want you back.

03:23.437 --> 03:26.374
We need you.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.785
Hi, Teri. Good morning.

03:37.818 --> 03:39.553
Hi.

03:39.587 --> 03:42.423
This lady was one
of my brightest nurses.

03:42.456 --> 03:44.358
Thanks for meeting me,
Dr. Swain.

03:44.392 --> 03:47.295
It's fortunate Teri
reached out to me when she did.

03:47.328 --> 03:50.764
I know a diagnosis
like stage IV lymphoma cancer

03:50.798 --> 03:52.866
sounds about as bad as it gets,

03:52.900 --> 03:54.302
but lymphoma can be treated.

03:54.335 --> 03:56.704
And even stage IV patients
can survive,

03:56.737 --> 03:58.238
provided
we treat it aggressively.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.107
Well, I didn't even think
I had a chance.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.742
But we need
to immediately start you

04:01.775 --> 04:03.777
on chemo. Doxorubicin.

04:05.946 --> 04:07.781
Isn't this called...

04:08.749 --> 04:10.117
the angel and the devil?

04:10.150 --> 04:11.419
Yes.

04:12.486 --> 04:13.821
The good news about doxorubicin

04:13.854 --> 04:15.155
is it has the potential

04:15.188 --> 04:16.757
to dramatically arrest
the lymphoma

04:16.790 --> 04:18.158
in just a few weeks.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.728
That soon?

04:21.762 --> 04:23.664
That's why it's called an angel.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.734
The devil is
in its side effects.

04:26.767 --> 04:30.070
Besides the usual suspects
of dry mouth, nausea, fatigue,

04:30.103 --> 04:31.972
in rare cases,
it can cause tumors

04:32.005 --> 04:33.574
and affect the heart muscle.

04:33.607 --> 04:34.975
But I could be cancer-free

04:35.008 --> 04:36.344
in a matter of weeks?

04:36.377 --> 04:37.978
No.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.847
But we can stop it
in its tracks.

04:45.486 --> 04:48.356
Thank you.

04:48.389 --> 04:50.791
No, Becky, we're not bringing

04:50.824 --> 04:52.192
your flu-ridden ass on tour.

04:52.225 --> 04:53.670
You're gonna get
the whole damn tour sick

04:53.694 --> 04:55.796
before it even begins.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.365
Is that Typhoid Becky?

04:57.398 --> 04:59.500
Yeah. Where the hell you been?

04:59.533 --> 05:00.944
Look, man,
I got to tell you something.

05:00.968 --> 05:03.270
It's not easy.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.205
Yeah, well, spit it out.

05:11.479 --> 05:13.647
I got picked up for questioning
by the Feds.

05:16.984 --> 05:19.186
So, what did they want?

05:19.219 --> 05:21.855
It's not a what. It's a who.

05:21.889 --> 05:24.492
They want Damon Cross's head
on a platter,

05:24.525 --> 05:26.660
and they'll happily
take you down to get him.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.633
So, Thirsty-ass just lied
to the Feds?

05:32.666 --> 05:35.869
Would you rather he told them
about our little jaunt to Panama

05:35.903 --> 05:38.372
and how Damon freed up
every dime we're using

05:38.406 --> 05:39.740
- for this tour?
- Look,

05:39.773 --> 05:41.050
Lucious is right,
because if the Feds

05:41.074 --> 05:42.710
connect our money to Damon's,

05:42.743 --> 05:44.912
they'll tie it up for months.
Maybe even years.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.147
I got that part. So,
what are we supposed to do now?

05:47.180 --> 05:48.916
- We need to scrub Panama.
- What?

05:48.949 --> 05:50.651
- That's impossible.
- No, it's not.

05:50.684 --> 05:52.420
I made a call to a guy
that's going to erase

05:52.453 --> 05:54.888
ours and Eddie's name off
of any bank

05:54.922 --> 05:56.757
that Damon
has ever been associated with,

05:56.790 --> 06:00.060
and I got another guy going
to clean it up by hand.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.104
But what about the finder's fee?

06:01.128 --> 06:02.730
We wired that money to him.

06:02.763 --> 06:05.332
Yeah, I rerouted that
to a nonprofit that I set up

06:05.365 --> 06:07.405
- and made it look like a donation.
- Wait a minute.

06:08.368 --> 06:09.770
Is this the same charity

06:09.803 --> 06:12.606
you set up in my name
two weeks ago?

06:12.640 --> 06:15.075
Lucious, the same charity
that's supposed to rewrite

06:15.108 --> 06:17.445
our story together?

06:17.478 --> 06:19.613
You are using that charity

06:19.647 --> 06:21.357
- to hide money from the Feds?
- I had no choice.

06:21.381 --> 06:22.626
- Are you stupid?! Are you serious?
- Look, I had no choice.

06:22.650 --> 06:23.960
I don't need to be here
for this part

06:23.984 --> 06:25.395
- of the conversation.
- You need to sit your ass down.

06:25.419 --> 06:27.387
'Cause you neck-deep in this
like the rest of us.

06:27.421 --> 06:28.565
Now, I'm telling you,
they're watching

06:28.589 --> 06:30.090
every move that we make,

06:30.123 --> 06:32.225
and we need to erase Damon Cross
from our lives

06:32.259 --> 06:33.761
by any means necessary.

06:33.794 --> 06:35.395
Is that why I got calls
from Panama

06:35.429 --> 06:37.631
saying that somebody
was meddling in my business?

06:48.442 --> 06:49.786
What is this?
You trying to erase me?

06:49.810 --> 06:51.078
Wait, now, nobody's meddling

06:51.111 --> 06:52.312
in your business, brother.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.047
But when your business

06:54.081 --> 06:56.550
brings the Feds
sniffing around my livelihood,

06:56.584 --> 06:57.951
then yeah, bets are off, man.

06:57.985 --> 06:59.620
All bets are off,
but the threats are on?

06:59.653 --> 07:01.388
Can we just stop
with the chest-thumping

07:01.421 --> 07:02.599
for a minute
and maybe get an explanation

07:02.623 --> 07:04.057
why the Feds
are sniffing around you

07:04.091 --> 07:05.258
in the first place?

07:05.292 --> 07:07.995
Well, the AUSA finds me
endlessly fascinating.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.639
She always wants to know
who I'm taking to the prom.

07:09.663 --> 07:11.331
Yeah, well, your beloved

07:11.364 --> 07:13.477
has gripped up my attorney
and is asking him questions

07:13.501 --> 07:14.902
about me and my business.

07:14.935 --> 07:16.604
This was never about you,
Lucious.

07:16.637 --> 07:18.906
But your JV scrub job was sloppy.
Wait.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.008
Wait, wait. Who do you think
you talking to, man?

07:21.041 --> 07:22.810
You raising red flags.
This is my business.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.745
I should've been
your first call.

07:24.778 --> 07:26.179
Cookie,

07:26.213 --> 07:28.281
we're gonna need to retrace
your moves

07:28.315 --> 07:29.483
after you got off the plane.

07:29.517 --> 07:30.784
I'm not going back to Panama

07:30.818 --> 07:32.419
- with you, man.
- That wasn't an invite.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.187
I can do it in a phone call.

07:34.221 --> 07:36.423
Send me the list, and I'll
send you an encrypted e-mail

07:36.456 --> 07:38.425
- when it's done.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:38.458 --> 07:39.503
You don't call shots in my house

07:39.527 --> 07:41.128
- and leave.
- Lucious. Lucious.

07:46.333 --> 07:48.536
You got 24 hours.

07:49.537 --> 07:51.138
You're welcome.

07:58.546 --> 08:00.514
There went a man.

08:00.548 --> 08:02.482
A whole man.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.518
You already got

08:04.552 --> 08:06.720
one dead husband in an urn.
You want a matching set?

08:08.155 --> 08:10.323
Now, every move we make
is being watched.

08:10.357 --> 08:12.526
We need to erase

08:12.560 --> 08:14.828
- his visit from this office today.
- I got it.

08:14.862 --> 08:16.372
See, you and me, baby,
we got a tour to run.

08:16.396 --> 08:17.698
Come on.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.405
You need to kill it
with these damn secrets, too.

08:25.438 --> 08:28.475
I know. I'm so sorry,
but I had no choice.

08:28.508 --> 08:30.578
Cookie, I just need you

08:30.611 --> 08:32.212
to take a look at this
for one second.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.347
Look, she's super dope.
Oprah even follow her.

08:34.381 --> 08:36.683
Now, if Oprah follow her,
you know she's popping.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.027
You know,
Oprah just don't follow anybody.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.554
Look, look, I've been up
for 48 hours straight, child,

08:40.587 --> 08:42.690
and you want me to watch
some stupid-ass video?

08:42.722 --> 08:44.858
Don't nobody care
about no trash-talker.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.435
Hey Beautiful
got ten million followers.

08:46.459 --> 08:48.361
- Just look.
- Wake up, Philly.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.330
It's me, Hey Beautiful.

08:50.363 --> 08:53.366
And hello to you, beautiful.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.669
Can we talk

08:55.703 --> 08:57.037
about Empire's Trust Tour?

08:57.070 --> 08:58.772
Or should I say Rust Tour,

08:58.806 --> 09:01.046
'cause, really, who's trying
to see that crusty nonsense?

09:01.074 --> 09:02.375
Is this bitch serious?

09:02.409 --> 09:04.845
I don't think you can call
a nonbinary a bitch.

09:04.878 --> 09:05.946
If the shoe fits.

09:05.979 --> 09:07.014
Free.

09:07.047 --> 09:10.383
And is this tour
even worth free?

09:10.417 --> 09:12.753
You need to change your name
to Hey Bitch.

09:12.786 --> 09:13.954
Don't they know their brand

09:13.987 --> 09:15.355
starts with "T"
and ends in "rash"?

09:15.388 --> 09:16.590
Who's she calling trash?

09:16.624 --> 09:18.959
Not me, sis. She says

09:18.992 --> 09:20.393
I'm the only one
worth paying for.

09:20.427 --> 09:22.195
I'll pay for it, Mama.

09:23.764 --> 09:26.299
Welcome to the #MeToo party bus.

09:26.333 --> 09:28.769
All right.
Y'all whole asses listen up.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.939
I'm the emperor.
I'm the queen. I'm the HBIC.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.241
There's only one rule
on this party bus.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.876
This ain't no party bus.

09:35.909 --> 09:37.310
We only here for two hours.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.079
That mean don't drink,
don't fight,

09:39.112 --> 09:40.223
and don't go number two
in the loo.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.725
Hold it all in
till you get to the venue.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.552
- Really?
- You're cyberstalking your ex?

09:45.585 --> 09:48.388
Come on.
This is worse than I thought.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.657
It's not even your ex's IG.

09:49.690 --> 09:51.158
It's your ex's ex's IG.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.592
Seriously.

09:52.626 --> 09:54.261
You got to move on, man.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.338
You know, to get over someone,

09:55.362 --> 09:56.740
you've got to get
under someone else.

09:56.764 --> 09:57.974
- You know what I'm saying?
- Really?

09:57.998 --> 09:59.242
And now we're banning
your phone.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.801
Okay, so, here's the deal.
You-you here

10:00.834 --> 10:03.671
to spread some across-the-pond
white girl wonder

10:03.704 --> 10:05.281
or whatever,
not to comment on my sex life.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.107
- Can I please have that?
- It's Becky.

10:07.140 --> 10:08.785
"Your plans are way too big,
Jamal. You got to strip it down

10:08.809 --> 10:10.310
and just play
'Loving You is Easy.'"

10:10.343 --> 10:13.146
Yeah, well, delete.
I'm not screwing some stranger,

10:13.180 --> 10:15.749
and I'm not singing some
damn maudlin love song to Kai.

10:17.450 --> 10:19.319
This is so cool.

10:19.352 --> 10:20.353
Y'all, this is Wynter.

10:20.387 --> 10:21.621
And you know Maya.

10:21.655 --> 10:23.090
Where's Hakeem? He miss his bus?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.668
Now, why would he miss
his own damn bus?

10:24.692 --> 10:26.293
He on time, riding solo.

10:26.326 --> 10:27.961
Unlike you. Bus number one.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.330
- Cool.
- All right, the rest of y'all,

10:30.363 --> 10:32.666
whoever last name ain't Lyon
needs to line up.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.701
Nah, I got it. I got it.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.669
Thanks.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.538
So, Hakeem got his own bus,
but not you?

10:38.571 --> 10:40.640
It's only two hours.
I'll survive.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.210
Maybe.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.377
Yo, say the word,

10:44.411 --> 10:45.979
and I'll lay his ass out.

10:46.013 --> 10:47.881
My knight in shining armor.

10:47.915 --> 10:49.693
- What can I say?
- That's right. That's right. The white knight.

10:49.717 --> 10:51.852
- I like that.
- Hey, look...

10:51.885 --> 10:54.788
You two were just the two people
I was looking for.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.565
Actually, do you mind
if I ride on your bus with you?

10:56.589 --> 10:58.558
'Cause I was looking
at your number,

10:58.591 --> 11:00.236
and I kind of think
the choreo falls a little flat.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.662
You're a dancer, so why
do we not have you dancing?

11:02.696 --> 11:04.373
I think that you should probably
pull her in close.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.133
You throw a leg around her.

11:06.166 --> 11:08.077
He dips you. It makes it
much more exciting. Wait.

11:08.101 --> 11:09.669
- Let me ask you a question.
- Yeah.

11:09.703 --> 11:12.505
So, if you're Jamal's assistant,
why are you talking to me?

11:22.850 --> 11:24.484
And, baby, don't get me started

11:24.517 --> 11:26.486
with the tragedy
that is Coocious.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.555
I wonder if
Lucious' illegitimate Lyon cub

11:28.588 --> 11:30.657
can carry a tune.
Now throw his ass on tour.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.325
Now, that I'd pay to see.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.361
Like and comment below.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.121
What you looking at?

12:01.154 --> 12:03.190
- Looks kind of juicy.
- Can I help

12:03.223 --> 12:04.291
your ass with something?

12:04.324 --> 12:05.292
Yes.

12:05.325 --> 12:07.394
Even if Damon can scrub Panama,

12:07.427 --> 12:09.963
he still just waltzed his ass
on in here

12:09.997 --> 12:12.299
with who-knows-how-many Feds
watching him, right?

12:12.332 --> 12:15.268
So, I have a plan.

12:15.302 --> 12:17.604
We invite him to Philly
under the pretext

12:17.637 --> 12:20.207
of wanting his clients
to invest in the tour.

12:20.240 --> 12:23.777
That way,
if the FBI trailed him here

12:23.811 --> 12:26.279
or his name shows up
on any stray call log...

12:26.313 --> 12:28.315
Empire is covered.

12:28.348 --> 12:29.449
That part.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.118
- Boop.
- I like that.

12:31.151 --> 12:32.619
- Yes.
- Smart.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.621
And I'll escort him there,
no problem.

12:34.654 --> 12:36.156
Um, you know,

12:36.189 --> 12:37.590
take one for the team.

12:37.624 --> 12:40.160
Or maybe two. Ha.

12:40.193 --> 12:42.662
I'll see you.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.898
Ho.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.512
Now, look, sugar,
I wasn't saying

12:49.536 --> 12:50.503
I would sleep with just anyone.

12:50.537 --> 12:53.506
But, you know, on tour,

12:53.540 --> 12:55.508
you got to try new things,

12:55.542 --> 12:56.509
taste new flavors.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.845
You're disgusting.

12:57.878 --> 12:59.346
Yo, come on, Blakey, back me up.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.014
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No..

13:01.048 --> 13:04.251
Don't try to pull him into this,
okay? This is a gentleman.

13:04.284 --> 13:05.819
Learn from him.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.857
Don't knock it
till you try it, though.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.459
'Scuse me. Nope.
Back up. Thanks.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.943
You see Suavecito over there
trying to get fresh with me?

13:19.967 --> 13:22.335
Well, I mean,
it has been a long time.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.679
I'm just saying,
you being a mama,

13:23.703 --> 13:25.472
it's time to clear the cobwebs.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.150
You know what I'm saying?
Put a banana in the monkey.

13:27.174 --> 13:29.476
You know, hot dog in your bun.

13:29.509 --> 13:30.677
I'm just saying.

13:30.710 --> 13:31.979
It's not funny.

13:32.012 --> 13:32.980
What's up, what's up?

13:33.013 --> 13:35.315
What's going on here?

13:36.749 --> 13:38.986
No.

13:40.820 --> 13:41.955
How's my neck?

13:41.989 --> 13:43.632
I couldn't tell
if I put it back on straight

13:43.656 --> 13:45.993
after Tiana bit it off.

13:46.026 --> 13:47.827
Yo.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.829
Between me and you,

13:49.863 --> 13:51.498
I thought it was a good idea.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.566
Yeah, I think so, too.
So, between me and you,

13:53.600 --> 13:55.511
I think you should try
and use it in the show still.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.837
- Yeah.
- I'm telling you, it's hot.

14:00.207 --> 14:03.010
I can also tell you like her.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.981
And it looks like
she's into you, too.

14:08.015 --> 14:10.850
Nah.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.186
Yeah?

14:13.220 --> 14:15.022
Look, all I'm saying

14:15.055 --> 14:17.324
is you two
on that stage together,

14:17.357 --> 14:19.893
in some, like, intimate tango.

14:19.927 --> 14:21.995
You pull her leg up,
she wraps it around you.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.531
That's sexy.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.737
Let me make you
more comfortable.

15:18.818 --> 15:19.987
Cookie.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.923
Cookie.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.927
Cookie. Cookie.

15:30.363 --> 15:33.200
Baby, what's all this mess
about Damon Cross?

15:34.267 --> 15:35.902
Giselle says

15:35.935 --> 15:38.405
we have to invite him down
to Philly now.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.316
So you might as well get
your nap on in the car,

15:40.340 --> 15:41.408
'cause the limo's waiting.

15:41.441 --> 15:42.785
Wouldn't be surprised
if his nasty ass

15:42.809 --> 15:44.077
wouldn't be sitting up

15:44.111 --> 15:46.079
underneath the seat
or something.

15:46.113 --> 15:50.483
Baby, wh-what, are you still mad
at me about the charity thing?

15:51.985 --> 15:54.287
I'm telling you,
it was a one-time thing.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.825
Yeah, it's always
a one-time thing with you.

15:58.858 --> 16:01.094
For the first time.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.962
Let's go.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.205
Welcome to the big time,
baby girl.

16:49.409 --> 16:51.178
Jamal, your 11 o'clock.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.379
What you showing at me for?

16:52.412 --> 16:54.181
Sorry to bother you.

16:54.214 --> 16:57.016
I'm Tyler Dupre. I'm with
the beverage sponsor.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.885
I'm a big fan.

16:58.918 --> 17:01.020
Just how big of a fan are you?

17:01.054 --> 17:02.389
It's nice to meet you.

17:09.396 --> 17:12.665
Yo. Yo, yo. Have you guys seen
Carlito? We're up next.

17:12.699 --> 17:14.410
Probably on the other side of
the stage, where you should be.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.169
- Go.
- Now, y'all know that tonight

17:16.203 --> 17:17.404
is just a dress rehearsal

17:17.436 --> 17:19.372
and the main performance
is tomorrow.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.846
But y'all got to treat tonight
like it's the only performance.

17:21.874 --> 17:22.914
Y'all hear that out there?

17:22.942 --> 17:24.211
Those are the VIPs,

17:24.243 --> 17:26.846
the money men, the influencers.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.581
They're your audience tonight,

17:28.615 --> 17:31.050
so you play tonight
like it's all you got.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.019
Y'all are up first.
You know that, right?

17:33.052 --> 17:34.921
I'm golden. Let's do it.
Let's go.

17:34.954 --> 17:37.257
That is what I like to hear.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.459
There's my girl.

17:39.492 --> 17:41.361
It's quite a setup.

17:41.394 --> 17:42.895
Joe, what are you doing here?

17:42.929 --> 17:44.364
He says he's Treasure's manager.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.465
I got to start the show.

17:45.498 --> 17:46.599
Her ex-manager.

17:46.633 --> 17:48.601
Not according to my lawyer.

17:48.635 --> 17:50.603
You got
a pretty great right hook,

17:50.637 --> 17:53.440
but my lawyer questions
whether that's the proper way

17:53.473 --> 17:55.908
to void my contract.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.646
So, great work, team.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.948
That Tiana duet
is a big fat hit,

18:01.981 --> 18:03.750
and I came to discuss my cut.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.885
Because if I don't get
what I'm owed,

18:05.918 --> 18:07.420
Treasure's next tour date

18:07.454 --> 18:09.389
- will be in a courtroom.
- No.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.324
No, Joe,
you can't do that to me.

18:11.358 --> 18:13.993
- For you, sweetheart. For us.
- Get off.

18:14.026 --> 18:15.162
- Don't touch me.
- Okay.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.963
So, an extortionist manager?

18:16.996 --> 18:19.966
Yeah, well, we know
what to do with your kind.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.501
Philadelphia,

18:21.534 --> 18:23.736
please give a warm welcome
to the grand return

18:23.770 --> 18:26.473
of Empire to the place
where it all started.

18:26.506 --> 18:30.777
Yeah, um, ladies, will y'all
give us a few minutes, please?

18:30.810 --> 18:33.146
Don't forget
the Feds could be watching.

18:33.180 --> 18:34.147
What's the matter with you?

18:34.181 --> 18:36.349
Keep your hands to yourself.

18:38.885 --> 18:42.355
So, Joe...

18:42.389 --> 18:46.259
I think maybe $20,000
should cover whatever...

18:46.293 --> 18:49.529
disagreements we have
regarding Treasure.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.973
Plus, you'll sign
a piece of paper saying

18:50.997 --> 18:52.699
you'll never see me again.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.468
Thirty.

18:55.502 --> 18:57.870
By tomorrow morning.

18:58.871 --> 19:01.107
Done.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.875
Enjoy the show.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.023
You sure you're okay?

19:17.056 --> 19:19.226
Come on, Teri, I already told
you. I'm-I'm good, okay?

19:19.259 --> 19:20.993
And listen to this...
Some people experience

19:21.027 --> 19:23.896
minimal to no side effects
from this type of chemo,

19:23.930 --> 19:25.465
- all right?
- I know, but that...

19:25.498 --> 19:27.300
that is not common.

19:27.334 --> 19:29.814
Well, then I must be one of the
lucky ones. And I'll take that.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.640
It's... it's Lucious.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.742
Um, just a minute.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.411
Hey, Pop.

19:38.445 --> 19:41.248
Nothing much, man. You?

19:41.281 --> 19:44.884
Yeah, yeah, give me a...
Give me a-a second.

19:46.219 --> 19:47.720
I'm ready.

19:49.422 --> 19:50.557
Treasure's manager?

19:50.590 --> 19:54.060
Okay. No,
I-I'll take care of it, Pop.

19:54.093 --> 19:56.496
All right. Bye.

19:56.529 --> 19:59.666
You're working? I'm s... I'm-I'm
sorry, you're-you're gonna have

19:59.699 --> 20:02.735
to tell your family
that you are very sick.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.937
It's a critical time
for Empire right now.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.939
I can't derail my family
with this.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.884
- Now... no, no...
- A-Andre, you just had a cycle

20:08.908 --> 20:10.377
of a cytotoxic drug.

20:10.410 --> 20:12.445
You essentially have poison

20:12.479 --> 20:13.556
running through your veins.

20:13.580 --> 20:15.214
You should not go out.

20:15.248 --> 20:16.449
And if your family knew,

20:16.483 --> 20:19.051
they would 100% not let you.

20:19.085 --> 20:20.720
My family doesn't know.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.455
My family's not gonna know.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.957
I'm fine. I'm fine.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.726
I'll be back. I'm fine.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.728
Wait, Andre...

20:29.762 --> 20:31.063
It's okay.

20:31.097 --> 20:32.241
I'm fine. I got it, I got it.

20:32.265 --> 20:33.633
It's okay. It's okay.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.468
- I just need some ai-air.
- Yeah. It's okay.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.304
It's okay. I got you.

20:37.337 --> 20:38.971
Hey, I got you. I got...

20:45.678 --> 20:46.979
Yo, where is Carlito?

20:47.013 --> 20:48.457
- He's missing dress rehearsal.
- What?

20:48.481 --> 20:50.483
- I thought he was with you!
- No.

20:50.517 --> 20:51.818
You should be out there!

20:51.851 --> 20:53.920
- Yes. Get your ass out there.
- Mic?

21:05.097 --> 21:06.566
Come on, come on, come on!

21:09.436 --> 21:11.404
What the hell is Treasure doing?

21:25.785 --> 21:27.754
What's wrong with the lights?

21:29.522 --> 21:31.123
Go on up there
and see what's going on!

21:43.336 --> 21:45.538
Treasure!
Treasure, watch out, girl...

21:51.243 --> 21:53.680
Come on, y'all. Not now.
Stop! Come on!

21:53.713 --> 21:54.781
Get away from her!

21:54.814 --> 21:56.483
Come on, y'all.
Give her a break.

21:56.516 --> 21:58.060
Just get up and dust yourself
off! You all right!

21:58.084 --> 21:59.318
Are you okay?

21:59.352 --> 22:01.521
Did you break anything?

22:01.554 --> 22:03.222
- I don't think so.
- She was right.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.457
I would pay to see this.

22:04.491 --> 22:05.525
Told Lucious that girl

22:05.558 --> 22:06.569
wasn't nowhere near ready.

22:06.593 --> 22:07.803
Come on, y'all.
Give her a break, y'all.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.362
Come on.

22:09.396 --> 22:10.797
Treasure.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.298
Treasure!

22:12.331 --> 22:14.567
Hey.

22:14.601 --> 22:16.869
I love you, Tiana!

22:23.042 --> 22:26.546
The dress
rehearsal for this free concert

22:26.579 --> 22:28.047
was a free-asco.

22:28.080 --> 22:29.849
Even the lights were like,
"-no."

22:29.882 --> 22:31.518
There wasn't
a professional in sight.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.920
Carlito was a no-show on stage,

22:33.953 --> 22:34.854
and while Hakeem was

22:34.887 --> 22:36.989
steppin' out with the help,

22:37.023 --> 22:38.224
#Bliana is still trying

22:38.257 --> 22:39.759
to become a thing.

22:40.893 --> 22:42.729
On to the GIF of the night,

22:42.762 --> 22:47.166
which I am calling "Treasure-
I-Land-ed Right on My Face."

22:48.435 --> 22:50.102
Baby Treasure gave us gold

22:50.136 --> 22:51.404
when she fell off the stage.

22:54.474 --> 22:57.510
I could watch that
a thousand more times.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.052
I'm not going back out there.

23:06.085 --> 23:07.954
Why?

23:09.422 --> 23:12.358
'Cause of that
sleazy-ass manager?

23:12.391 --> 23:14.026
You ain't got to worry
about him.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.795
- I took care of that.
- No, it's not...

23:15.828 --> 23:17.597
it's not Joe, it's me.

23:17.630 --> 23:19.265
I'm a fraud.

23:19.298 --> 23:20.900
Okay? I...

23:20.933 --> 23:23.269
I can't go back
out there, Lucious.

23:24.771 --> 23:26.973
Okay, I get it.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.275
It's imposter syndrome.

23:29.308 --> 23:31.410
It normally happens
to most artists

23:31.444 --> 23:34.280
right before they got
to go out on that big-ass stage

23:34.313 --> 23:36.483
and show the world
who they really are.

23:36.516 --> 23:37.784
No.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.786
No, it didn't happen to you.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.621
You think?

23:41.654 --> 23:45.057
You think I wasn't a kid
like you once?

23:45.091 --> 23:47.627
On these same streets.

23:47.660 --> 23:50.396
I had my own sound,

23:50.429 --> 23:52.665
but I had to go
through a lot of years

23:52.699 --> 23:55.735
of pain and hard knocks to...

23:55.768 --> 23:58.170
to hone that talent.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.773
'Cause that's what it means,
being a true artist.

24:00.807 --> 24:04.511
It means that you're not afraid
to shine through all the BS

24:04.544 --> 24:07.213
when it comes down to it,
you hear me?

24:08.715 --> 24:10.983
Yeah, I hear you,
but I don't know if...

24:11.017 --> 24:13.753
- that's me.
- No, no, ain't no buts.

24:13.786 --> 24:17.023
A diamond is nothing
but a piece of coal

24:17.056 --> 24:18.958
that does well under pressure.

24:18.991 --> 24:22.294
And gold is useless
until it's put through the fire.

24:22.328 --> 24:26.365
So without the pain,
the fire and the pressure,

24:26.398 --> 24:28.300
we would have no treasure.

24:31.538 --> 24:33.172
Did I just say that?

24:33.205 --> 24:34.807
You did.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.276
And you hear me, right?

24:37.309 --> 24:38.778
Well, good.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.312
- Yeah.
- 'Cause, you know,

24:40.346 --> 24:42.481
I'm not in the business
of, um...

24:42.515 --> 24:44.350
hypin' up frauds.

24:44.383 --> 24:46.886
Don't worry.

24:46.919 --> 24:48.988
You're gonna get
another shot at it tomorrow.

25:10.710 --> 25:12.344
All I know is that they best

25:12.378 --> 25:13.813
to keep the lights on
for my set.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.815
Boy, you're worried
about lights when

25:15.848 --> 25:18.551
some of y'all can't even keep
your feets on the damn stage.

25:18.585 --> 25:20.486
I stayed sober for this.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.088
Congratulations.

25:22.121 --> 25:23.222
So...

25:23.255 --> 25:25.057
up all night
with your "big" fan?

25:25.091 --> 25:26.158
You are nasty.

25:26.192 --> 25:28.160
Up all night...

25:28.194 --> 25:30.529
staring at the ceiling, alone.

25:30.563 --> 25:32.498
Me and my hand.

25:32.531 --> 25:34.000
Show must go on.

25:34.033 --> 25:35.935
Come on, y'all,
let's gather round.

25:37.637 --> 25:38.838
Keem, get your ass up here.

25:42.742 --> 25:45.511
Look, I'm gonna keep it real
with y'all.

25:45.544 --> 25:49.181
Half of the people out there
are waiting for us to fail.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.183
We know that's true,

25:51.217 --> 25:53.185
but it doesn't matter,
because the other half

25:53.219 --> 25:56.623
stood in that line...
because they trust us

25:56.656 --> 25:58.758
to deliver on stage.

25:58.791 --> 26:00.526
It's been a long road back

26:00.559 --> 26:02.361
for me, for my family,

26:02.394 --> 26:04.296
for every single person
in this room.

26:04.330 --> 26:06.899
Personally, I don't think
that second chances

26:06.933 --> 26:09.802
should be taken for granted.

26:09.836 --> 26:13.472
So tonight, we go out
and we be undeniable.

26:14.941 --> 26:17.209
And while we're at it,

26:17.243 --> 26:20.446
we write a brand-new chapter
in the history of Empire.

26:20.479 --> 26:22.381
Okay?

26:22.414 --> 26:23.482
- Yeah.
- All right.

26:23.515 --> 26:26.352
Wait. I got something to say.

26:32.024 --> 26:33.101
I hate you. I'm off the tour.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.761
- No...
- I'm quitting. I'm leaving.

26:44.871 --> 26:47.139
Hands on deck, fools.

26:47.173 --> 26:48.574
On the count of three.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.142
One, two, three.

26:50.176 --> 26:52.244
- Trust!
- Let's go kill this, y'all.

28:51.663 --> 28:53.265
Philly! Give it up

28:53.299 --> 28:58.404
for Empire's very own
Jamal Lyon!

29:01.573 --> 29:04.110
Jamal! Jamal! Jamal!

29:04.143 --> 29:05.778
Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal!

29:07.346 --> 29:10.049
Philadelphia, are you with me?!

29:12.084 --> 29:13.319
Let's go.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.922
One, two, three, four. Come on!

29:21.593 --> 29:23.495
What is going
on with the lights?

29:23.529 --> 29:25.164
I don't know,
we keep blowing a fuse

29:25.197 --> 29:26.598
in this raggedy-ass theater.

29:29.201 --> 29:32.771
Shh...

29:34.306 --> 29:36.542
Listen! Listen!

29:39.378 --> 29:42.081
All the way up there,
and up there, and down here.

29:42.114 --> 29:44.350
Everybody take their phones out
and light up the sky.

29:44.383 --> 29:47.119
Come on!

29:49.288 --> 29:52.291
Let's light this place up,
Philadelphia.

29:55.895 --> 29:57.663
Wow.

29:57.696 --> 29:59.832
Thank you. I love you.

30:04.703 --> 30:06.672
Can I sing y'all a love song?

30:12.578 --> 30:13.779
Please marry me.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.181
I love you.

30:15.214 --> 30:16.949
I love you.

30:22.154 --> 30:24.223
Anyone in here tonight...

30:24.256 --> 30:28.494
who's lucky enough to be with
the person that they love,

30:28.527 --> 30:31.697
pull them in tight.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.932
What's wrong?

31:11.203 --> 31:12.571
We got you, Jamal!

31:15.607 --> 31:17.109
Thank you, we love you!

31:17.143 --> 31:18.344
We love you!

31:18.377 --> 31:20.379
We love you!

31:20.412 --> 31:22.181
Jamal, it's all right, baby.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.582
It's okay, it's okay.

31:23.615 --> 31:25.717
Jamal! Jamal! Jamal! Jamal!

31:25.751 --> 31:27.119
Jamal! Jamal!

31:43.602 --> 31:46.372
She saved it. She saved it.

33:01.747 --> 33:03.149
Give it up for Wynter, y'all!

33:13.059 --> 33:14.293
Can I say something?

33:14.326 --> 33:15.461
Empire.

33:15.494 --> 33:16.695
This tour now,

33:16.728 --> 33:18.497
I came just to hate it,

33:18.530 --> 33:20.266
but now I must come correct.

33:23.402 --> 33:26.338
Tonight was everything.

33:26.372 --> 33:28.807
Best thing I've seen
since Beychella.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.476
Y'all turned it around
and got me.

33:32.944 --> 33:34.080
Jamal Lyon.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.550
You still have my heart, baby.

33:38.584 --> 33:41.987
Like and comment down below.

33:42.020 --> 33:43.889
To Empire!

33:49.528 --> 33:50.896
Should I tell you again?

33:50.929 --> 33:52.174
Or should I not tell you at all?

33:52.198 --> 33:54.166
- We did the damn thing.
- See me?

33:54.200 --> 33:56.268
I'm always after the new.
You know what I'm saying?

33:56.302 --> 33:58.370
You can't just wait
for life to happen.

33:58.404 --> 34:00.339
You gotta demand more
from the present.

34:00.372 --> 34:02.007
- Preach!
- Take what's yours.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.385
Can't let your past
hold you prisoner.

34:03.409 --> 34:04.686
You know what I'm talking about.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.612
- That's what I'm talking about.
- My God.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.914
Am I just... turnt right now

34:08.947 --> 34:11.083
or is Carlito making
a lot of sense?

34:12.583 --> 34:14.420
I mean, out of everyone
in this room,

34:14.453 --> 34:18.456
you know what it's like to have
the past mess up our future.

34:18.489 --> 34:20.726
I just wanna...

34:20.759 --> 34:23.295
leave all that mess behind,
and...

34:23.329 --> 34:25.397
live in the moment, you know?

34:25.431 --> 34:27.799
Yeah.

34:27.833 --> 34:30.235
- In the moment.
- Yeah.

34:30.268 --> 34:32.070
- In the moment.
- In the moment.

34:32.103 --> 34:33.639
I'll be back. I'll be back.

34:43.081 --> 34:44.559
Well, it looks like
she's into you..

34:44.583 --> 34:46.485
Whoa. Maya with the moves.

34:46.518 --> 34:48.154
What's up, girl?

34:50.188 --> 34:51.556
What's up?

34:51.590 --> 34:53.058
Um...

34:53.091 --> 34:55.627
I-I came over just
to tell you that, like...

34:55.661 --> 34:57.496
Thank you for using
my move out there.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.141
- No, no, no, no, no. No.
- You looked really good.

34:59.165 --> 35:01.900
It felt even better.
Seriously, I owe you one.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.902
You know, this tour
could have sucked without you.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.671
Thanks for that.

35:18.850 --> 35:20.495
Y-You really know how to put on
a great show.

35:26.558 --> 35:28.026
Where's Giselle?

35:28.059 --> 35:29.328
She had to take a call.

35:36.702 --> 35:38.504
So you just go after anything

35:38.537 --> 35:40.639
that's just put in front of you?

35:40.672 --> 35:43.375
Giselle's a lot of fun,
but that's strictly business.

35:43.409 --> 35:45.877
Well, maybe I don't want you
all mixed up

35:45.911 --> 35:48.514
in my business anymore.

35:48.547 --> 35:49.948
- Got it? Okay.
- Okay.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.718
And what I said
in Panama still stands.

35:52.751 --> 35:54.286
I won't chase you, Cookie.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.355
You have to come after me.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.226
I need to go find my husband.

36:09.067 --> 36:11.837
Come on, son. Ring back...

36:12.838 --> 36:15.207
Andre, come on.

36:15.241 --> 36:18.143
There you are.

36:18.176 --> 36:19.678
- Hey.
- Hey.

36:19.711 --> 36:21.247
What you doing all alone?

36:21.280 --> 36:23.249
Well... To be honest with you,
after that

36:23.282 --> 36:25.050
incredible performance of yours?

36:25.083 --> 36:27.018
I needed, some fresh air,

36:27.052 --> 36:29.221
'cause you knocked those people
off their feet.

36:29.255 --> 36:31.056
My God.

36:31.089 --> 36:32.767
I mean, I couldn't
have done it without you.

36:32.791 --> 36:35.093
What you said to me earlier.

36:35.126 --> 36:38.997
Baby, all I said was...

36:39.030 --> 36:41.400
I saw something in you

36:41.433 --> 36:44.536
that I think you just couldn't
see in yourself.

36:44.570 --> 36:46.372
It was always there.

36:46.405 --> 36:48.274
No, Lucious.

36:48.307 --> 36:51.543
You believed in me.

36:51.577 --> 36:53.379
You took care of me.

36:53.412 --> 36:55.847
- Treasure, what are you doing?
- Shh. Shh.

36:55.881 --> 36:57.359
- Wa-wait. Wait, wait. No, no.
- I just want to give you

36:57.383 --> 36:59.093
- a proper thank you.
- Wait, wait. No, no, no.

36:59.117 --> 37:00.528
- H-Hold... Whoa, whoa.
- Shh. I just want to thank you.

37:00.552 --> 37:01.863
This isn't what you do.
It's not what you do.

37:01.887 --> 37:03.898
- Come on. Let me... Stop.
- This is not what we do.

37:03.922 --> 37:06.124
- Just let me show you.
- No. Come on. No.

37:06.157 --> 37:08.427
- You little dirty bitch!
- Baby, baby!

37:08.460 --> 37:10.905
- How could you do this again?
- No, no, it's not what you think.

37:10.929 --> 37:12.798
- No, no, no... No, no, no, no.
- No! Baby...

37:12.831 --> 37:14.831
- No, don't you baby me.
- It's not what you think!

37:17.135 --> 37:18.404
Baby!

37:19.971 --> 37:22.073
Baby!

37:31.817 --> 37:34.152
Cookie, Cookie.
I know what it looked like.

37:34.185 --> 37:37.122
Baby. Baby. Baby!

37:37.155 --> 37:39.625
Baby, baby!
Baby, baby, just let me explain.

37:39.658 --> 37:42.628
Let me explain. Let me...

37:58.209 --> 38:00.779
- Excuse me. Thank you.
- Thank you.

38:33.011 --> 38:35.881
I'm fine, thank you.

38:37.883 --> 38:39.785
I'm fine!

38:45.491 --> 38:47.001
Who the hell's knocking
on the damn door

38:47.025 --> 38:49.795
like it's the police?

38:54.866 --> 38:56.702
You think I'd miss
your performance?

38:58.236 --> 38:59.705
So you saw.

39:06.578 --> 39:08.480
Now you call. Now you call.

39:08.514 --> 39:10.148
Andre, whatever it is
you need right now,

39:10.181 --> 39:12.317
- this is not the time, okay?
- No, Lucious,

39:12.350 --> 39:13.719
it's Teri.

39:21.259 --> 39:22.293
Hey.

39:25.864 --> 39:29.034
Are you drinking alone?

39:31.770 --> 39:34.606
I hope not.

39:55.927 --> 39:59.965
Andre doesn't want to tell you,
but he's sick.

39:59.998 --> 40:02.568
And he needs his family.

40:02.601 --> 40:05.971
I hate to be the one
to have to break this to you,

40:06.004 --> 40:10.041
but Andre has stage IV
lymphomic cancer,

40:10.075 --> 40:12.410
which means the cancer
has spread throughout...

40:16.114 --> 40:19.417
He's gonna have to do
intensive chemotherapy.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.001
Here you go.

40:36.034 --> 40:37.969
What is it?

40:38.003 --> 40:39.437
It's from Lucious.

40:46.177 --> 40:48.079
I gave you three sons, bitch.

40:48.113 --> 40:52.183
I went to jail for 17 years
so you could build it!

40:55.153 --> 40:56.454
Lucious Lyon

40:56.488 --> 40:59.991
is... my father.

41:01.793 --> 41:03.361
We wanted you to be
the first to know

41:03.394 --> 41:07.332
- that I have asked Anika to be my lovely wife.
- Bam.

41:10.201 --> 41:14.105
Empire was my destiny, Cookie.
It was my legacy!

41:14.139 --> 41:16.007
You, you, you!
Everything is you!

41:17.809 --> 41:19.110
It's okay, Lucious.

41:43.869 --> 41:46.938
Congratulations, Lucious.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.910
I saw Treasure tonight on stage,

41:51.943 --> 41:55.881
and I gotta say... wow.

41:57.215 --> 42:00.085
I'm impressed.

42:00.118 --> 42:03.421
But we have a problem.

42:03.454 --> 42:05.423
Your son, Andre,

42:05.456 --> 42:08.493
never showed with my money.

42:08.526 --> 42:12.430
Clearly, he's not
the talented one.

42:12.463 --> 42:16.434
It's kind of fortuitous, though,
because it's fair to say.

42:16.467 --> 42:19.537
Treasure's value's gone up
since she just killed it.

42:19.571 --> 42:21.940
And I couldn't possibly
let her go

42:21.973 --> 42:24.943
for less than...

42:24.976 --> 42:27.846
50 grand...

42:27.879 --> 42:30.048
a month.

42:30.081 --> 42:32.383
I know that sounds like
a lot of coin,

42:32.417 --> 42:35.954
but we both know she's worth it.

42:38.890 --> 42:42.861
Okay.

42:42.894 --> 42:46.264
Perhaps we can strike
some sort of

42:46.297 --> 42:48.133
suitable compromise.

43:25.871 --> 43:28.306
Captioned by
Media Access Group at WGBH.

44:09.347 --> 44:11.482
Now that Empire
has you all fired up,

44:11.516 --> 44:13.819
here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

44:16.021 --> 44:18.690
Rule number one
if you want to stay alive.

44:18.724 --> 44:20.625
Don't lie to your doctor.

44:23.829 --> 44:26.865
- Profits over patients, again.
- You save your morality lesson.

44:26.898 --> 44:28.233
You have to save him!

44:28.266 --> 44:30.335
Be careful.

44:30.368 --> 44:32.370
- You tried to kill him.
- I had no choice!

44:36.374 --> 44:37.743
Shall we?

44:40.611 --> 44:43.882
