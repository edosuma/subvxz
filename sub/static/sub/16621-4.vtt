00:09.210 --> 00:12.211
¶ You call me to tell me
what's up with you ¶

00:12.213 --> 00:14.213
¶ Huh? ¶

00:14.215 --> 00:16.682
¶ We're living
on top of the world, it seems ¶

00:16.684 --> 00:18.684
¶ Way up here
in a higher place ¶

00:18.686 --> 00:21.186
Whoa.
Uh-huh.

00:21.188 --> 00:23.155
¶ What's our time?
Are you coming over? ¶
(chuckles)

00:23.157 --> 00:25.758
You've got to be kidding me.

00:25.760 --> 00:28.127
Whew.

00:28.129 --> 00:30.062
(indistinct chatter)

00:30.064 --> 00:35.134
¶ Oh, clouds
that I keep falling through ¶

00:36.170 --> 00:39.038
Do you think anyone here
knows it's only Thursday?

00:39.040 --> 00:41.507
Dude, I don't think anyone here
cares that it's only Thursday.

00:41.509 --> 00:43.509
Who are these people?
I don't know.

00:43.511 --> 00:45.477
Oh.

00:45.479 --> 00:47.413
(laughing)

00:47.415 --> 00:48.414
How you ladies doing?

00:48.416 --> 00:49.782
Hey. Happy Thursday.

00:49.784 --> 00:52.284
(groaning, laughing)

00:52.286 --> 00:54.620
Not cool, man. Not cool.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.755
Dude, you started with the whole
Thursday thing. Got in my head.

00:56.757 --> 00:59.425
That's still not cool.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.727
Thanks.
(chuckles)
Yeah.

01:01.729 --> 01:04.630
I could get used
to this.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.698
Ever think maybe we got
into the wrong business?

01:06.700 --> 01:09.701
I don't know what business
this is, but I'm in.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.703
<i> Salud.</i>
<i> Salud.</i>

01:11.705 --> 01:13.639
Jessie, I think
I'm in love.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.374
Dude, you have to drink
or it's bad luck.

01:15.376 --> 01:17.376
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
(coughing)

01:17.378 --> 01:18.577
Yo, Jessie,
you okay?

01:18.579 --> 01:19.578
You okay? Jessie.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.530
(coughing continues)

01:21.531 --> 01:23.481
Jessie, you okay?
Jessie. Somebody help!

01:23.484 --> 01:25.150
Jessie! Jessie!

01:25.152 --> 01:26.185
Call 911!

01:26.187 --> 01:27.686
Are you okay?! Jessie!

01:27.688 --> 01:31.123

01:31.125 --> 01:34.626
¶ ¶

01:51.579 --> 01:53.245
(sniffs, exhales)

01:53.247 --> 01:55.581
SAM:
Oh, man.

01:55.583 --> 01:57.116
(grunts)

01:57.118 --> 01:58.117
Whoa.

01:58.119 --> 02:00.185
(sniffs)
What's wrong with you?

02:00.187 --> 02:03.188
(grunts)
Get thrown off the mechanical
bull at Saddle Ranch again?

02:03.190 --> 02:05.724
(grunts)
I told you to lay off
the mescal.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.227
I didn't go out last night.

02:08.229 --> 02:10.395
Okay. So what's going on?

02:10.397 --> 02:13.398
Nothing.
Just did a little, uh...

02:13.400 --> 02:15.267
a little something yesterday.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.636
(grunts)
Oh.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.272
Oh, yeah.
Ouch. What, a colonic?

02:21.242 --> 02:23.242
A triathlon.

02:26.180 --> 02:28.213
When were you training
for a triathlon?

02:30.351 --> 02:31.884
You didn't train.

02:31.886 --> 02:34.419
So you swam
a mile,

02:34.421 --> 02:36.688
biked 25 miles,
then ran another six

02:36.690 --> 02:38.423
without warning your body first?

02:38.425 --> 02:39.725
Well, it was an Ironman,
so, technically,

02:39.727 --> 02:41.627
it was 2.4 miles,
112 miles,

02:41.629 --> 02:43.896
and 26.2 miles.

02:43.898 --> 02:45.197
With no heads-up.

02:45.199 --> 02:47.299
Kind of
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

02:47.301 --> 02:49.902
All right, so you
just momentarily lost your mind

02:49.904 --> 02:51.436
and thought you were 20 again?

02:51.438 --> 02:52.738
What were you

02:52.740 --> 02:53.906
trying to prove?

02:53.908 --> 02:55.574
That I could do an Ironman.

02:55.576 --> 02:57.676
Better not affect your
performance in the field today.

02:57.678 --> 02:59.578
I feel great.
I don't want to hear

02:59.580 --> 03:01.313
a thing about, you know,
your tight calves

03:01.315 --> 03:02.915
or your chafed nipples.
Well, then you

03:02.917 --> 03:05.284
definitely don't want to hear
about my rectus femoris.

03:05.286 --> 03:06.769
No, I do not.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.253
Mmm.
But I do have a question.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.888
Did you actually finish?

03:09.890 --> 03:11.190
Of course.

03:11.192 --> 03:13.258
Was the sun still up?

03:13.260 --> 03:14.893
O ye of little faith.

03:14.895 --> 03:17.229
Hey, is this
a good stopping point?

03:17.231 --> 03:19.231
Because this feels
like a good stopping point.

03:19.233 --> 03:20.265
Is this a good stopping point?

03:20.267 --> 03:21.900
Because we actually have a case.

03:21.902 --> 03:24.269
(groans softly)

03:24.271 --> 03:26.905
You need a hand, Ironman?

03:26.907 --> 03:29.241
I'm gonna meet you up there,
actually.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.576
'Cause I got to, uh...

03:30.578 --> 03:32.878
I just got to check
on a few things here.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.279
Okay. Right.
Not a word

03:34.281 --> 03:35.614
about your chafed nipples.

03:35.616 --> 03:36.648
Not a word.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.719
Never mind.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.554
Long story.
Yeah.

03:42.556 --> 03:45.691
(grunts)
This is fun.

03:45.693 --> 03:47.759
(sniffs, exhales)

03:54.868 --> 03:56.335
Where's Hetty?

03:56.337 --> 03:57.903
Called in sick.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.972
Where is she really?

03:59.974 --> 04:01.974
I suspect she's out
mole hunting.

04:01.976 --> 04:03.508
Alone?

04:03.510 --> 04:06.712
She said, "Honey badger
don't mess around."

04:06.714 --> 04:09.248
What the hell
does that mean?

04:09.250 --> 04:10.449
I was afraid to ask.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.850
What do we got?

04:11.852 --> 04:13.518
Cell phone footage
from a party

04:13.520 --> 04:15.520
in Malibu
yesterday.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.889
What the hell
was in that drink?
NELL: Not sure.

04:17.891 --> 04:19.358
Compound's still being analyzed.

04:19.360 --> 04:21.360
ERIC: But we're guessing
it's a caustic poison.

04:21.362 --> 04:25.430
Whatever it was burned holes
in his throat and esophagus.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.299
Bet that killed
the vibe.

04:27.301 --> 04:28.967
Man's name was Jessie Evans.

04:28.969 --> 04:30.936
NELL: He worked as
a U.S. Citizenship

04:30.938 --> 04:32.404
and Immigration
Services agent

04:32.406 --> 04:34.039
with the Department
of Homeland Security.

04:34.041 --> 04:36.408
Not only that-- he's the second

04:36.410 --> 04:38.510
USCIS agent
to die

04:38.512 --> 04:40.712
in Los Angeles
in the past month.
GRANGER: So SECNAV

04:40.714 --> 04:42.347
wants us to
investigate.

04:42.349 --> 04:43.782
Who's the friend?

04:43.784 --> 04:44.983
Uh, Carlos Gutierrez.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.419
He's not a USCIS agent.
He and Jessie Evans

04:47.421 --> 04:48.954
knew each other from college.

04:48.956 --> 04:51.890
All right.
Send him to the boatshed.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.293
Already on his way. Nell,
get Deeks from the hospital.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.060
You two
are working together again.

04:55.062 --> 04:57.296
Okay. Great.

04:57.298 --> 04:58.831
SAM:
Let's try to keep

04:58.832 --> 05:00.365
the fisticuffs
to a minimum today.
(chuckles)

05:00.367 --> 05:03.435
Right. (chuckles)
I'll just, uh....
Uh,

05:03.437 --> 05:05.204
Nell.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.972
Earpiece.
Thanks. I always forget.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.974
Good luck.
Thank you.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.042
Nell.

05:10.044 --> 05:10.942
(exhales)

05:10.944 --> 05:12.477
(keys jangle)

05:12.479 --> 05:14.579
Right. Keys.

05:14.581 --> 05:15.781
Thanks.

05:18.052 --> 05:19.985
To the 'Bu
we go.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.054
Yeah.

05:38.706 --> 05:41.707
Good morning, sunshine!

05:41.709 --> 05:43.775
I got your two
favorite things,

05:43.777 --> 05:47.379
breakfast burritos
and fresh coffee

05:47.381 --> 05:49.114
I did with a French press.
I'm just kidding.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.916
I bought that at a store.
You smell that?

05:50.918 --> 05:53.952
(sniffs) Pretty good.
All you got to do is wake up.

05:53.954 --> 05:55.921
(sniffs)
That's not bad.

05:57.024 --> 05:58.490
What the hell?

05:58.492 --> 06:00.826
(indistinct chatter)

06:00.828 --> 06:02.094
Excuse me.

06:02.096 --> 06:03.729
Hi.

06:03.731 --> 06:07.399
My, uh, fiancée's
engagement ring is missing.

06:07.401 --> 06:08.834
Where'd she leave it?

06:08.836 --> 06:11.036
On her finger.
And she's in a coma.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.838
I'm sorry.
Let me go get the charge nurse.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.906
Yeah, you do that.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.845
God, you got to be kidding me.

06:19.847 --> 06:21.880
Is this what
you're looking for?

06:21.882 --> 06:25.417
We noticed it on her hand when
we were checking her vitals.

06:25.419 --> 06:26.852
Why did you take it off?

06:26.854 --> 06:28.854
Valuables sometimes go missing.
And in her condition...

06:28.856 --> 06:30.856
Yeah, no,

06:30.858 --> 06:32.124
that makes sense. Of course.
I'm glad you...

06:32.126 --> 06:33.024
Thank you for doing that.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.860
It's a beautiful ring.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.962
Did you pick it
out together?
No, no.

06:36.964 --> 06:39.564
It, uh, was gonna be a surprise.

06:39.566 --> 06:41.733
She actually hasn't seen it yet.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.935
She's gonna love it.
Um, it's probably best

06:43.937 --> 06:45.937
if you hold onto it
just a little while longer.

06:45.939 --> 06:49.141
Until she wakes up.
Right.

06:49.143 --> 06:51.143
Until then.
Okay.

06:51.145 --> 06:53.745
If you need anything else,
just let me know.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.114
Thank you for grabbing it.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.115
You're welcome.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.718
In the pocket.

07:02.055 --> 07:04.055
Hey, guys. Owner around?

07:04.057 --> 07:05.924
Right there.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.594
I can't picture her
riding a flamingo.

07:09.596 --> 07:11.763
You think?
(Sam chuckles)

07:11.765 --> 07:13.865
Excuse me.

07:13.867 --> 07:15.517
Is this
your place?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.168
Oh, I wish.
Have you seen the view?

07:17.171 --> 07:18.970
Five beds, six baths,

07:18.972 --> 07:21.106
Sub-Zero and Wolf appliances
throughout.

07:21.108 --> 07:23.575
And zoned
for Webster Elementary.

07:23.577 --> 07:26.745
Are you two interested
in leasing or buying?

07:26.747 --> 07:28.213
Oh, actually, could I get
your numbers first?

07:28.215 --> 07:30.015
I'm Diane.
And you are?

07:30.017 --> 07:32.751
Agent Callen, NCIS.
This is my partner, Agent Hanna.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.586
You do know
this is the scene

07:34.588 --> 07:36.221
of an active
murder investigation.

07:36.223 --> 07:37.923
Oh, you're
absolutely right,

07:37.925 --> 07:40.342
and I am so sorry.

07:40.343 --> 07:42.760
But did I mention the rain
shower in the master bath?

07:42.763 --> 07:45.063
We're looking for the owner.
Oh.

07:45.065 --> 07:46.465
I've been trying to sell
this place for eight months,

07:46.467 --> 07:47.732
and I don't even know the owner.

07:47.734 --> 07:50.569
My guess is
that it's some sheikh.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.471
Then who threw the party
yesterday?

07:52.473 --> 07:54.072
Some guy. Very cute.

07:54.074 --> 07:56.942
I believe he said he made
his money in kitty litter.

07:56.944 --> 07:57.943
CALLEN:
So you rented

07:57.945 --> 07:59.211
the house out for the party?

07:59.213 --> 08:01.112
Oh, yes. I market the home

08:01.114 --> 08:04.049
to potential buyers
at a daily rate, sure.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.550
Smart.

08:05.552 --> 08:06.985
Well, except
for the misdemeanor.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.721
I thought I heard "misdemeanor."
Renting a house

08:09.723 --> 08:11.189
in a single-family neighborhood
for a party

08:11.191 --> 08:13.058
is punishable up to a year
in jail.

08:13.060 --> 08:14.159
Jail?

08:14.161 --> 08:14.993
Mm-hmm.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.261
Did he say "jail"?

08:16.263 --> 08:18.096
He said "jail."
Jail.

08:18.098 --> 08:19.898
Now's the time
when you find a way

08:19.900 --> 08:22.033
to help us out. Fast.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.035
Right.
(chuckles)

08:24.037 --> 08:26.571
Well, actually, um,
I'm not supposed to know this,

08:26.573 --> 08:28.907
but I figured out a way
to access the security cameras.

08:28.909 --> 08:31.910
See, I have a teeny-tiny
problem with voyeurism.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.846
Which I blame on menopause.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.516
And my husband...
Well, he's my ex.

08:37.518 --> 08:41.219
I mean, would that help
or was that TMI?

08:42.823 --> 08:44.155
After you, Diane.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.290
(chuckles)

08:45.292 --> 08:46.475
All righty.

08:46.476 --> 08:47.659
Check out that view
as we walk out.

08:47.661 --> 08:50.128
Yeah, it's beautiful.
It's beautiful.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.065
Hey.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.002
There you go.
Thanks.

08:57.004 --> 08:58.737
How you
holding up?

08:58.739 --> 09:01.740
Uh, coffee will help.
Mmm.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.809
I don't think I actually ever
fell asleep last night.

09:04.811 --> 09:07.045
I never...

09:07.047 --> 09:11.616
Jessie was alive in my arms,
and then he wasn't.

09:11.618 --> 09:15.086
And there was nothing
I could do to help him.

09:15.088 --> 09:16.621
How did you end up at the party?

09:16.623 --> 09:17.989
Did you guys know somebody
there?

09:17.991 --> 09:19.558
No.

09:19.560 --> 09:21.893
Those people were from,
like, a different planet.

09:21.895 --> 09:26.331
Jessie and I were grabbing
a bite yesterday,

09:26.333 --> 09:28.667
and this woman,
this-this gorgeous woman,

09:28.669 --> 09:30.902
at the next table over
started talking to us.

09:30.904 --> 09:32.871
She told us about
this sick party up in Malibu.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.272
Said all we needed
was a password,

09:34.274 --> 09:36.808
"kiwi," to get in.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.710
So we showed up.

09:38.712 --> 09:41.613
And it sounded like fun
at the time, you know?

09:46.053 --> 09:49.187
DIANE:
You two just let me know
if you need anything.

09:49.189 --> 09:51.056
We're good, Diane.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.091
Where'd that drink
come from?

09:53.093 --> 09:55.760
DIANE:
Agent Hanna--

09:55.762 --> 09:57.095
and I'm
just making

09:57.097 --> 09:58.830
chitchat here--
would you say

09:58.832 --> 10:03.101
you and your family are
comfortable in your home or...

10:03.103 --> 10:04.803
We're very comfortable.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.037
DIANE:
Fabulous.

10:06.039 --> 10:07.238
Just makes me

10:07.240 --> 10:08.974
so happy to hear.

10:08.976 --> 10:11.910
Um, but it's also such a shame,

10:11.912 --> 10:13.244
given today's
interest rates are probably

10:13.246 --> 10:15.080
the lowest they'll
ever be in our lifetimes.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.081
Well, certainly mine.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.983
You're still a spring chick.

10:17.985 --> 10:18.984
Diane.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.986
We're working, we're working.

10:20.988 --> 10:24.756
Okay. Okay, okay.

10:24.758 --> 10:27.292
There.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.765
Got a better angle on her face?

10:33.767 --> 10:36.668
DEEKS:
You recognize that woman?
Yeah.

10:36.670 --> 10:38.737
That's the girl
who told us about the party.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.272
Well, she was there, and she put
something in Jessie's drink.

10:41.274 --> 10:43.875
It was a setup?

10:43.877 --> 10:45.377
Possibly, yes.

10:47.914 --> 10:50.148
Listen, I'm sorry.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.083
I know the woman
in that photograph.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.019
Another former
love interest, sir?

10:54.021 --> 10:55.820
Her name's Ming Wah.

10:55.822 --> 10:56.888
She's a notorious hit woman
for the Triad.

11:11.972 --> 11:15.306
SAM: Uh-oh.
CALLEN: You just had to take
Mulholland, didn't you?

11:15.308 --> 11:19.044
G, the shortest distance between
two points is a straight line.

11:19.046 --> 11:20.412
Mulholland is 21 miles
of curves.

11:20.414 --> 11:22.047
There's nothing straight
about it.

11:22.049 --> 11:23.815
Maybe he's just out there
getting some fresh air.

11:23.817 --> 11:26.017
Doesn't look like
his fresh air face to me.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.020
(strained):
Oh, God.
What's up, sir?

11:29.022 --> 11:32.223
We got Triad trouble.

11:32.225 --> 11:35.226
This woman is believed
to be a Triad assassin.

11:35.228 --> 11:36.928
Her name's
Ming Wah.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.731
If looks could kill.
Oh, wait, they do.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.132
She worked for Zhang Kiu.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.401
SAM:
Triad boss.
U.S. tried

11:43.403 --> 11:44.936
to extradite him
for years.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.471
Doesn't matter anymore.
Zhang Kiu

11:46.473 --> 11:48.139
was killed by
a rival organization a year ago.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.140
But his assassin

11:49.142 --> 11:51.009
may be of some value.

11:51.011 --> 11:54.012
Might be able to tell us who
now runs the Triad's operations.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.113
Find her.

11:55.115 --> 11:59.350
And when you do,
I want first crack.

12:07.027 --> 12:10.028
Oh...

12:10.030 --> 12:12.097
I'll just tell you later.
(chuckles)

12:12.099 --> 12:14.899
No. No.

12:14.901 --> 12:18.069
I know me. You know me.
I'm gonna forget.

12:18.071 --> 12:21.740
I'm going to write myself
a reminder.

12:21.742 --> 12:23.808
(sing-songy):
Spanking.

12:25.011 --> 12:26.311
Oh.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.246
That recycling story
I heard on NPR this morning.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.115
You are definitely gonna want
to hear about that.

12:30.117 --> 12:31.950
(chuckles)
Yeah.

12:31.952 --> 12:33.485
Whipped...

12:33.487 --> 12:35.086
cream.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.955
(exhales)

12:38.759 --> 12:42.327
How have I not told you about
the new comic I am reading?

12:42.329 --> 12:45.330
It is set in modern day Detroit,
based on the Roman Empire.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.831
It's like...
(mimics explosion)

12:46.833 --> 12:50.001
So cool. Domination.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.172
(keys clacking)

12:56.009 --> 12:57.308
What you got there, Beale?

12:57.310 --> 13:00.378
Hmm? Oh.
Um, I'm just keeping tabs

13:00.380 --> 13:03.381
on, uh, all the things I want
to tell Nell when she gets back.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.884
Well, I have a personal
and professional obligation

13:05.886 --> 13:08.219
to have you not do that.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.854
What? Uh...

13:09.856 --> 13:10.822
No, are you...

13:10.824 --> 13:12.174
P-Please don't...

13:12.175 --> 13:13.525
Think about her on your own time
and thank me later.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.164
Where are we
on finding Ming Wah?

13:19.166 --> 13:21.900
Oh. Uh, Ming Wah, our hit woman.

13:21.902 --> 13:23.968
Or hit lady.

13:23.970 --> 13:27.138
Is there really a proper name
for an assassiness?

13:27.140 --> 13:29.274
Right?

13:29.276 --> 13:30.875
'Cause... Okay. Um,

13:30.877 --> 13:33.495
there are not that many
traffic cameras in the area,

13:33.496 --> 13:36.114
so I wasn't able to follow her
in or out of the party itself.

13:36.116 --> 13:39.851
But you put your special
gray matter to work and...

13:39.853 --> 13:42.120
And I was able to track her
from the restaurant

13:42.122 --> 13:44.289
where she first told
Jessie Evans about the party

13:44.291 --> 13:47.392
to a warehouse in Culver City.
And?

13:47.394 --> 13:48.993
And it's been leased
to a shell company

13:48.995 --> 13:50.895
that I was able to trace

13:50.897 --> 13:52.497
to Mainland China.
All the way...

13:52.499 --> 13:56.234
to these guys.
Look at that. There's our girl

13:56.236 --> 13:57.969
who killed Jessie Evans
yesterday

13:57.971 --> 14:00.038
and her old boss, Zhang Kiu.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.040
The lease was signed
two years ago,

14:02.042 --> 14:04.576
before Zhang Kiu
was killed.

14:04.578 --> 14:07.846
I'll let the team know.
Mm-hmm.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.053
Yeah. Now I see it.

14:15.055 --> 14:16.555
(tires screech)

14:16.556 --> 14:18.056
(horns honking)
Okay. All right.
You know what,

14:18.058 --> 14:19.891
we could just...
Just eyes on the road

14:19.893 --> 14:23.561
would be fantastic.
Come on. I said I was sorry
about the U-turn.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.029
Yeah, that was more
like an ampersand.

14:25.031 --> 14:28.066
Going for accuracy,
I'd call it a G-clef.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.468
Can we just ten and two?
Put the paws on ten and two
and then just...

14:30.470 --> 14:33.938
If we could just look ahead,
that'd be so much safer.
Yep.

14:33.940 --> 14:35.607
If it'll help
you calm down.
I'm super calm.

14:35.609 --> 14:38.009
Calmer than you are.
For the record,

14:38.011 --> 14:40.311
I have no idea what happened
back at that off-ramp.

14:40.313 --> 14:42.981
That was a near collision
and a near-death experience,

14:42.983 --> 14:45.984
which isn't a great combination.
I mean, where did that
truck even come from?

14:45.986 --> 14:47.652
Blind spot. Came right
from the blind spot.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.254
Right...
(whooshing sound) there.

14:49.256 --> 14:51.623
Okay, Deeks, usually
I'm driving a Mini,

14:51.625 --> 14:54.192
so this is, like, a whole lot
of car for me right now.

14:54.194 --> 14:57.395
You do realize you're playing
right into a stereotype, right?

14:57.397 --> 15:00.465
Oh, definitely. And you realize
I'm sitting on a first aid kit

15:00.467 --> 15:03.001
to see over the
steering wheel, right?

15:03.003 --> 15:04.002
Right.

15:04.004 --> 15:05.504
Thank you.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.005
No, no. I mean, like, you were
supposed to take a right.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.007
It veers off, and we were...
I'll have you know

15:09.009 --> 15:10.441
that I am an
excellent driver.
we were getting out...

15:10.443 --> 15:11.976
Okay? So from here on out,

15:11.978 --> 15:13.945
I'm going to be
that excellent driver.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.680
It's fine. 'Cause my regular job
doesn't give me

15:15.682 --> 15:19.317
enough adrenaline. I got
to double down with you driving.
Okay. Okay. Enjoy it

15:19.319 --> 15:20.985
while you can, bud,
because, soon enough,

15:20.987 --> 15:23.254
Kensi and her perfect little
driving skills will be back

15:23.256 --> 15:25.924
and the two of you
can live happily ever after.

15:28.995 --> 15:30.528
I'm sorry.
That...

15:30.530 --> 15:33.998
that came out...
all kinds of wrong.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.267
Um...
No, no, it's good.
I totally got what you were...

15:36.269 --> 15:39.003
Listen, when we get there,
just stay to my left,
(sighs)

15:39.005 --> 15:41.072
and let's keep a lid
on the head kicks.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.941
(chuckles)
I'll try.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.409
Okay.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.315
How's Kens?

15:50.317 --> 15:52.283
No news. What do we got?

15:52.285 --> 15:54.452
Behind this, we have a
freestanding two-story building.

15:54.454 --> 15:56.721
Front entrance, back entrance,
fire escape on the roof.

15:56.723 --> 15:58.389
No surveillance
cameras.

15:58.391 --> 16:00.258
Also can't guarantee
what's on the inside.

16:00.260 --> 16:02.260
Eric didn't see anyone
go in or out.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.996
But he also doesn't know
if it's empty.
Not only that--

16:04.998 --> 16:07.298
we don't know what the Triad's
using the warehouse for.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.068
These guys got their hands
in a lot of honeypots.
Yeah, could be

16:10.070 --> 16:12.603
drugs, guns, exotic animals--
you name it.

16:12.605 --> 16:15.039
Wait, there's a chance
we're gonna see monkeys in here?

16:15.041 --> 16:16.374
Besides the one we have?
(chuckles)

16:16.376 --> 16:18.576
I'm more of a jungle cat.
You know that.

16:18.578 --> 16:20.745
Why don't you guys
take the front?

16:20.747 --> 16:23.548
Yeah.

16:23.550 --> 16:24.716
You got this.

16:24.718 --> 16:26.484
I know.

16:41.101 --> 16:43.067
(clicks tongue)
Ooh. Nice.

16:45.138 --> 16:47.405
Okay, we're good. On your count.

16:47.407 --> 16:50.575
CALLEN:
On three. One, two, three.

16:50.577 --> 16:51.642
Moving.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.582
(door creaks)

17:01.521 --> 17:04.055
DEEKS:
Clear.
Clear.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.058
Clear.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.370
Are we sure
this isn't an Amazon depot?

17:19.372 --> 17:21.773
They're all purses.

17:21.775 --> 17:23.775
Same thing here.

17:23.777 --> 17:26.611
High-end. Hermès. Louis Vuitton.

17:26.613 --> 17:28.613
It's like
a Neiman Marcus sample sale.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.815
No. The clasp's all wrong.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.317
Should be a rectangle,
not a square. And it should be

17:33.319 --> 17:34.786
gold, not silver.

17:34.788 --> 17:37.422
And the logos

17:37.423 --> 17:40.057
are backwards. And this is all
kinds of funky. And, no, Deeks,

17:40.060 --> 17:42.260
I'm not playing into some sort
of stereotype, okay?

17:42.262 --> 17:44.429
I'm just extremely
detail-oriented.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.631
So, what, the Triads
are planning on waging a war

17:46.633 --> 17:48.499
with an arsenal of fake purses?

17:48.501 --> 17:51.169
They might. These bags aren't
as harmless as they look.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.504
Counterfeit goods fund
child labor,

17:53.506 --> 17:54.806
human trafficking,

17:54.808 --> 17:56.674
even terrorism.

17:56.676 --> 17:59.343
Like the 2004 terrorist bombings
in Madrid.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.212
DHS seizes billions
in fake goods every year.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.114
And that's just what
they can find.

18:03.116 --> 18:06.451
Well, that "bags" the question--
pun intended...

18:06.453 --> 18:08.186
Nobody?
No takers?
NELL: No.

18:08.188 --> 18:10.588
All right.
How'd these get past the gates?

18:10.590 --> 18:11.756
(door opens)
(man speaking Chinese)

18:11.758 --> 18:13.091
(door shuts)

18:24.671 --> 18:26.737
(speaks Chinese)

18:28.274 --> 18:30.808
(speaking Chinese)

18:30.810 --> 18:32.376
Federal agents!

18:32.378 --> 18:34.112
(shouts)

18:34.848 --> 18:37.448
I said
federal agent!

18:37.450 --> 18:39.884
Easy.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.453
Nice and easy.
Just...

18:42.455 --> 18:43.788
(grunting)

18:44.424 --> 18:46.124
(grunts)
(Deeks groans)

18:46.126 --> 18:48.392
(grunting)
God! Son of a...

18:48.394 --> 18:50.394
Ouch. Stairs.

18:50.396 --> 18:51.863
Yeah.
(groans)

18:51.865 --> 18:53.264
(grunting)

18:59.439 --> 19:02.507
Now, that's a jungle cat. Whew.

19:02.509 --> 19:05.143
(panting)
Federal agents.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.416
Uh! Uh!

19:12.418 --> 19:13.818
Turn around. Hands up.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.321
Hands up.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.789
Don't come back to me.

19:18.791 --> 19:21.325
Stay there. Hands up.

19:23.163 --> 19:25.296
(grunting)

19:25.298 --> 19:26.297
(groans)

19:26.299 --> 19:27.465
(grunting)

19:27.467 --> 19:30.201
(crack)
(groaning)

19:33.840 --> 19:35.907
(groaning)

19:38.311 --> 19:40.311
G,

19:40.313 --> 19:42.313
check this out.

19:42.315 --> 19:44.448
You seeing
what I'm seeing?

19:44.450 --> 19:46.918
Zhang Kiu.

19:46.920 --> 19:48.186
You look pretty good
for a dead man.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.470
How goes your mole hunt?

20:07.440 --> 20:09.874
(chuckles softly)

20:11.811 --> 20:14.912
Are you cleaning that because
you're planning on using it?

20:15.882 --> 20:17.848
So, Zhang Kiu

20:17.850 --> 20:20.384
isn't dead. He's been hiding out
here in Los Angeles.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.486
His murder was a ruse.

20:26.526 --> 20:29.994
Listen, I've got an agent down,
and it's been one hell of a day.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.862
I could use your involvement.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.001
Who gave him his papers to come?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.469
The Chinese government.

20:44.010 --> 20:46.010
So they blessed the lie.

20:46.012 --> 20:48.312
They get to evict their
most deranged criminal

20:48.314 --> 20:50.514
and dump him on us.

20:50.516 --> 20:52.850
What's Beijing's next move?

20:52.852 --> 20:57.388
And how many others have
they snuck into our backyard?

21:00.260 --> 21:02.326
Happy hunting.

21:11.604 --> 21:16.274
Zhang Kiu,
Zhang Kiu, Zhang Kiu.

21:16.276 --> 21:18.809
Well, I hope you've
been making the most

21:18.811 --> 21:21.045
of your time here
in Los Angeles.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.814
Surf Malibu, walk Rodeo.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.549
Maybe check out The Broad.

21:25.551 --> 21:26.817
The Broad is a must.

21:26.819 --> 21:28.586
SAM:
You picked a good time
to come here.

21:28.588 --> 21:29.587
CALLEN:
Mm-hmm.

21:29.589 --> 21:30.888
The really good news is

21:30.890 --> 21:33.758
you are going to get to see
all of our seasons.

21:33.760 --> 21:36.994
SAM:
Despite what people think,
we do have seasons.

21:36.996 --> 21:40.698
Because you are never
getting out of here.

21:43.469 --> 21:46.737
I will be on a plane home
before breakfast.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.606
(scoffs)

21:48.608 --> 21:51.475
The man talks.

21:51.477 --> 21:53.778
He talks make-believe,
but he talks.

21:53.780 --> 21:57.348
You think you're going back
home, as in "back to China"?

21:57.350 --> 22:00.484
You sound surprised,
Agent Hanna.

22:00.486 --> 22:02.586
The same country that
issued you a fake ID

22:02.588 --> 22:04.055
so you could come
here, China.

22:04.057 --> 22:07.591
Yes. China, China.

22:07.593 --> 22:09.093
Did it ever occur to you
why your country

22:09.095 --> 22:11.028
was so eager
to help you leave?

22:11.030 --> 22:15.533
My country owed me a great debt.

22:15.535 --> 22:17.768
Want to know what I think?

22:21.741 --> 22:23.674
Well, I'm curious.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.509
Thank you.

22:25.511 --> 22:27.812
I think they gave you a choice.

22:27.814 --> 22:31.349
Either you leave, or you spend
the rest of your life,

22:31.351 --> 22:33.551
without parole,
in Tilanqiao Prison.

22:33.553 --> 22:36.053
CALLEN:
Hmm. Known for its torture
and human rights violations.

22:36.055 --> 22:40.458
Yeah. I would, uh...
I'd choose L.A., also.

22:42.028 --> 22:43.127
NELL:
Oh, snap!

22:43.129 --> 22:44.796
Watch and learn,

22:44.797 --> 22:46.464
because Sam and Callen
are two of the best.

22:46.466 --> 22:49.834
Obviously, behind Hetty
and Granger and myself.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.435
Kensi, whoa,
Kensi's the best.

22:51.437 --> 22:52.837
Do not mess with her,

22:52.839 --> 22:55.072
because she can do good cop,
bad cop all by herself.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.108
She just uses her good eye
and then her weird eye.

22:57.110 --> 22:59.910
She probably freaks people out
with that thing.
She does.

22:59.912 --> 23:01.145
She starts off all
nice and charming,

23:01.147 --> 23:02.446
and then she gets in there

23:02.448 --> 23:03.614
and she just turns
on the dead eye,

23:03.616 --> 23:04.815
and she's like,
"What, did you do it?

23:04.817 --> 23:06.550
"Did you do it? Dead
eye's coming after you.

23:06.552 --> 23:08.052
Did you do it?"
Okay, Chucky, I got it.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.154
I'm just saying
she gets stuff done.

23:10.156 --> 23:12.590
Yeah, she's one
tough mother.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.525
Yeah. I know.

23:16.629 --> 23:19.530
I know.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.599
Hey. So I found a connection

23:21.601 --> 23:23.401
between Jessie Evans

23:23.403 --> 23:25.069
and the other USCIS agent
who died this month.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.937
Turns out,
they were both investigating

23:26.939 --> 23:29.006
Zhang Kiu's fake
immigration papers.

23:29.008 --> 23:30.908
That's what got
them both killed.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.810
I'm guessing Ming Wah
is behind both hits.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.745
Yeah, but how did Zhang Kiu
know that Homeland Security

23:34.747 --> 23:37.047
was investigating him
both times?

23:37.049 --> 23:38.816
ERIC:
I don't mean to be starting
any conspiracy theories here,

23:38.818 --> 23:42.186
but is it possible
he hacked DHS?

23:42.188 --> 23:44.588
I don't know what's worse,
deranged crime boss

23:44.590 --> 23:46.857
hacking the DHS,
or the Chinese government?

23:46.859 --> 23:48.826
Hmm.

23:48.828 --> 23:50.895
(phone chimes)

23:54.834 --> 23:56.167
How'd you know Jessie Evans

23:56.169 --> 23:58.469
was looking into
your I.D. papers?

24:00.840 --> 24:03.674
Is that the reason
you're holding me here?

24:03.676 --> 24:05.142
What, you thought this
was about fake purses?

24:05.144 --> 24:07.211
The bad fake purses,
I might add.

24:07.213 --> 24:09.113
The LV logo
was just kind of...

24:09.115 --> 24:11.182
funky.

24:12.518 --> 24:14.018
He's very detail-oriented.

24:14.020 --> 24:16.153
Now answer the question.

24:16.155 --> 24:17.988
How did you know
Jessie Evans was in

24:17.990 --> 24:20.224
the Department
of Homeland Security?

24:20.226 --> 24:22.493
I don't even know
who you're talking about.

24:22.495 --> 24:23.494
CALLEN:
Hmm.

24:23.496 --> 24:25.095
How about the other Citizenship

24:25.097 --> 24:27.665
and Immigration
Services agent you had killed?

24:27.667 --> 24:30.201
How'd you know
what he was working on, huh?

24:30.203 --> 24:33.103
Did you have your people
hack into DHS?

24:33.105 --> 24:35.005
(chuckles)

24:35.007 --> 24:39.009
Did the Chinese government
hack into DHS?

24:39.011 --> 24:42.680
(continues chuckling)

24:42.682 --> 24:45.816
Boy, this is the happiest
I've seen you all day.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.185
Nobody hacked anything.

24:48.187 --> 24:49.687
There was no need.

24:50.690 --> 24:52.490
I have enemies.

24:52.492 --> 24:54.892
But I also have friends.

24:54.894 --> 24:55.960
Any of your friends work at the
Department of Homeland Security?

25:24.257 --> 25:27.725
What are you doing, Beale?

25:27.727 --> 25:28.726
Making an entrance.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.261
It's impressive.

25:30.263 --> 25:33.764
Those applications?

25:33.766 --> 25:34.832
You're replacing Kensi.

25:37.603 --> 25:40.104
Do you have
something for me or not?

25:40.106 --> 25:42.273
(clears throat) We still
don't know who Zhang Kiu

25:42.275 --> 25:43.574
has working for him
inside Homeland Security.

25:43.576 --> 25:45.943
But Callen and Sam think
whoever it is

25:45.945 --> 25:47.978
has been helping him smuggle
purses, drugs, and contraband

25:47.980 --> 25:50.047
into the country for years.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.882
DHS has come under fire
for mismanaging personnel

25:51.884 --> 25:53.250
and budgets.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.052
It's the reason they created
those fusion centers, right?

25:55.054 --> 25:57.588
To help rein in
the spending.

25:57.590 --> 25:59.256
But then the fusion centers
went and blew their budgets

25:59.258 --> 26:01.559
on Tahoes and plasma TVs.

26:01.561 --> 26:05.029
I guess hiring all those MBAs
hasn't quite paid off.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.096
You think?

26:06.098 --> 26:08.232
Wait.

26:08.234 --> 26:10.601
You think Zhang Kiu
has someone working for him

26:10.603 --> 26:12.736
inside one of
the DHS fusion centers.

26:12.738 --> 26:14.305
That's where I'd start
making friends.

26:14.307 --> 26:16.240
Weakest link in
the security chain.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.708
Yeah.

26:17.710 --> 26:19.777
Yeah, that's good.

26:27.753 --> 26:29.186
I know, it's none of
my business, sir,

26:29.188 --> 26:32.656
But I know for a fact
that Kensi's gonna be back.

26:32.658 --> 26:35.826
Besides, she's irreplaceable.

26:38.064 --> 26:40.197
I wish that were true, Beale,

26:40.199 --> 26:42.199
but it's not.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.201
For any of us.

27:01.387 --> 27:02.386
Hello.

27:02.388 --> 27:04.054
Are you the doctor?

27:04.056 --> 27:05.923
No, I work with Agent Blye.

27:05.925 --> 27:07.391
I'm Julia Feldman.

27:07.393 --> 27:08.392
Kensi's mom.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.027
Owen Granger.

27:10.029 --> 27:11.629
She's spoken of you.

27:11.631 --> 27:13.097
I bet.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.765
Listen, I'm gonna
go and come back.

27:14.767 --> 27:16.734
No, please, I was just
reading to her.

27:16.736 --> 27:19.236
This was her favorite book
as a kid.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.138
I think we both know it
word for word,

27:21.140 --> 27:22.906
we read it so many times.

27:22.908 --> 27:25.209
She left it behind
when she, uh...

27:25.211 --> 27:26.944
ran away to be with her dad.

27:28.848 --> 27:30.948
Some nights I'd read it
when she was gone.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.182
Even though I didn't know
where she was,

27:32.184 --> 27:35.185
it-it made me feel like
we were still together.

27:35.187 --> 27:37.087
Do you have children?

27:37.089 --> 27:38.756
I have a daughter.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.992
Are you close?

27:40.993 --> 27:43.227
I wasn't a part of her life
until recently.

27:44.997 --> 27:46.130
I know what that's like.

27:46.132 --> 27:48.065
But they say it's...

27:48.067 --> 27:50.134
it's never too late.

27:53.105 --> 27:55.205
We finally got to be together
after a very long time.

27:57.309 --> 27:59.777
I don't think I could take
losing her again.

28:04.417 --> 28:06.917
Listen, would you...

28:06.919 --> 28:08.952
like to get a
coffee or something?

28:08.954 --> 28:11.255
That would be very nice.

28:11.257 --> 28:12.990
I could use some fresh air.

28:12.992 --> 28:14.058
Thank you.

28:19.765 --> 28:21.432
WOMAN (over P.A. system):
Anesthesiologist to ER.

28:21.434 --> 28:24.368
Anesthesiologist to ER.

28:24.370 --> 28:27.404
Everyone knows Homeland Security
can't keep track of its money.

28:27.406 --> 28:28.939
So what does America do?

28:28.941 --> 28:30.240
Enlighten us.

28:30.242 --> 28:31.475
What do we do?

28:31.477 --> 28:34.411
Hire more people,
and pour in more money.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.814
And you think that's
a bad business decision.

28:36.816 --> 28:39.249
(chuckles)
Incredibly stupid.

28:39.251 --> 28:41.251
Only an American
could be that stupid.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.420
That's a little harsh.

28:43.422 --> 28:45.823
You can't expect someone to go
from Harvard Business School

28:45.825 --> 28:47.024
to Pacoima

28:47.026 --> 28:49.927
without feeling cheated.

28:49.929 --> 28:52.429
"Cheated."

28:52.431 --> 28:53.831
Hmm.

28:53.833 --> 28:55.733
Interesting.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.101
DEEKS:
What was that?

28:57.103 --> 28:59.103
Did Callen just
wink at us?

28:59.105 --> 29:00.504
Mm, I think it was
more of a tic.

29:00.506 --> 29:02.139
Does Callen have a tic?

29:02.141 --> 29:03.774
No, I think it just looked
like a tick.

29:03.776 --> 29:05.242
Is that something you
develop later in life?

29:05.244 --> 29:06.376
Is this something I
should be worried about?

29:06.378 --> 29:08.212
Maybe. He said Pacoima.

29:08.214 --> 29:09.913
He also said
Harvard Business School.

29:09.915 --> 29:12.216
That's oddly specific.
That's something we can use.

29:12.218 --> 29:14.952
So, how did Callen and Sam
get this guy to start talking?

29:14.954 --> 29:16.220
Because they're good.

29:16.222 --> 29:18.322
They're very, very good.

29:18.324 --> 29:19.389
All right.

29:21.894 --> 29:23.177
BEALE:
Hey, guys, so I checked out

29:23.178 --> 29:24.461
all the Harvard
Business School grads

29:24.463 --> 29:27.097
working at the Pacoima
DHS Fusion Center,

29:27.099 --> 29:29.066
and two names stand out.

29:29.068 --> 29:30.501
Who are they?

29:30.503 --> 29:32.770
Donna Merritt. She's single.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.404
Has no connection
to China or Hong Kong.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.340
According to her bank account,

29:36.342 --> 29:38.776
she is definitely not making
a government salary.

29:38.778 --> 29:40.077
And the other?

29:40.079 --> 29:41.145
Edward Lee.

29:41.147 --> 29:42.446
His parents are
Chinese Nationals

29:42.448 --> 29:44.414
who immigrated here
the year he was born.

29:44.416 --> 29:47.017
He's never visited
Shanghai before,

29:47.019 --> 29:49.853
but, ever since 2013,
he's been twice a year.

29:49.855 --> 29:51.522
All right, Nell and I
will check out Edward.

29:51.524 --> 29:53.223
Sam and I got Donna.

29:57.229 --> 29:59.029
Dark roast.
Thanks.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.197
Hi.
Hey.

30:00.199 --> 30:01.498
Have you been here before?

30:01.500 --> 30:02.833
Yo, Edward.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.167
What's up? The usual?
Hey, my man.

30:04.170 --> 30:06.503
You know it.
Uh... (laughs)

30:06.505 --> 30:07.538
Yeah, yeah, I mean,
I probably give half my paycheck

30:07.540 --> 30:09.190
to this place.

30:09.191 --> 30:10.841
Okay, then, I have a
serious question for you.

30:10.843 --> 30:13.410
Uh-huh.
How do you feel about
this mojito iced coffee?

30:13.412 --> 30:15.045
Oh, it is mind-blowing.

30:15.047 --> 30:16.880
Once you try it,
there is no turning back.

30:16.882 --> 30:18.415
(chuckles) So I'll be
funneling half my paycheck

30:18.417 --> 30:19.516
to this place too?

30:19.518 --> 30:20.918
Yeah, exactly.
(chuckles)
Okay.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.737
No, no, I'm serious.

30:22.738 --> 30:24.555
Like, my girlfriend, she moved
to Shanghai a few years ago,

30:24.557 --> 30:26.423
but every time she's in town,

30:26.425 --> 30:28.392
she makes me drive here
directly from the airport.

30:28.394 --> 30:30.161
Shanghai?

30:30.162 --> 30:31.929
That is some
serious long distance.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.198
Yeah, yeah,
I would not recommend it.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.533
(chuckles) So, you've,
uh, been keeping that up

30:36.535 --> 30:38.485
for a while or...
Mm-hmm.

30:38.486 --> 30:40.436
Although we both make the
flight, like, twice a year each,

30:40.439 --> 30:42.039
so, you know, it's pretty
manageable at least.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.540
Gotcha.
Well, that's cool.

30:43.542 --> 30:46.009
Well, good luck
with that, and, uh...

30:46.011 --> 30:48.045
thanks for the java tip.
Yeah, absolutely.

30:48.047 --> 30:50.047
Take care.
BARISTA: Dirty chai latte?

30:50.049 --> 30:53.450
(sighs) So, I don't think
Edward's in bed with Zhang Kiu.

30:53.452 --> 30:56.053
DEEKS: Agreed. You can go grab
me one of those minty coffees.

30:56.055 --> 30:58.922
Easy on the cream,
heavy on the sugar.

30:58.924 --> 31:00.591
In your caffeinated dreams,
Deeks.

31:00.593 --> 31:02.526
Is that my chai tea?

31:02.528 --> 31:04.161
Do they make
gluten-free muffins?

31:04.163 --> 31:06.230
Nell? Mm.
Nope, nope.

31:13.372 --> 31:14.438
(grunts)

31:15.541 --> 31:17.608
(exhales sharply, then sniffs)

31:18.611 --> 31:20.377
What?

31:20.379 --> 31:22.546
Why you lookin'
at me like that?

31:22.548 --> 31:24.948
Everything okay with,
you know, with those?

31:24.950 --> 31:26.383
Really?

31:26.385 --> 31:28.018
I just almost broke a guy's arm

31:28.020 --> 31:29.253
who was coming at you
with a knife.

31:29.255 --> 31:31.154
With my bare hands.

31:31.156 --> 31:32.556
But I bet your
calves are killing you.

31:32.558 --> 31:35.425
Oh, you have no idea.
Hey.

31:36.428 --> 31:38.562
SAM:
Looks like Donna's had company.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.678
Clear!

31:54.680 --> 31:57.247
G, in here.

32:04.523 --> 32:06.490
Ming Wah.

32:06.492 --> 32:08.625
She's gone.

32:08.627 --> 32:13.397
Looks like two gunshot wounds,
about an hour ago.

32:13.399 --> 32:15.565
That'd give Donna Merritt
plenty of time to get away.

32:15.567 --> 32:18.468
At least now we know
who Zhang Kiu is working with.
I'm gonna

32:18.470 --> 32:20.337
assume that their professional
relationship is over

32:20.339 --> 32:22.205
at this point,
considering Zhang Kiu just tried

32:22.207 --> 32:23.273
to have her killed.

32:37.189 --> 32:38.989
ERIC:
According to Donna Merritt's
financials,

32:38.991 --> 32:41.058
Zhang Kiu is either paying her
extremely well...

32:41.060 --> 32:42.960
Or she's ripping him off.

32:42.962 --> 32:45.095
Bingo. I think Zhang Kiu
finally realized

32:45.097 --> 32:47.064
that Donna Merritt's
been building her own

32:47.066 --> 32:49.232
contraband empire
behind his back.

32:49.234 --> 32:51.368
Whoever said greed was good?
ERIC:
Oh.

32:51.370 --> 32:52.670
There's more.

32:52.671 --> 32:53.971
Donna Merritt has also
been assigning

32:53.973 --> 32:57.307
bogus DHS contracts
to a shell corporation,

32:57.309 --> 32:59.676
owned and operated by...

32:59.678 --> 33:00.744
Donna Merritt.

33:00.746 --> 33:02.479
She's certainly entrepreneurial.

33:02.481 --> 33:03.747
Harvard would be proud.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.282
How many contracts we talking?

33:05.284 --> 33:06.984
I found over $400 million

33:06.986 --> 33:09.286
worth of stolen funds so far.

33:09.288 --> 33:11.321
Give me one reason why
I shouldn't unleash Zhang Kiu

33:11.323 --> 33:12.990
on her right now.

33:12.992 --> 33:14.691
I think she should be
fed to the dogs.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.727
But we did get
the toxicology report back

33:16.729 --> 33:18.628
on Jessie Evans' autopsy.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.664
The pill that was
put into his drink

33:20.666 --> 33:24.167
was laced with a lethal dose
of the same caustic poison

33:24.169 --> 33:26.153
found in counterfeit
prescription drugs

33:26.154 --> 33:28.138
currently on street corners
throughout the Southwest.

33:28.140 --> 33:29.139
GRANGER:
Don't tell me.

33:29.141 --> 33:30.507
It was made in China.

33:30.509 --> 33:32.509
Zhang Kiu doesn't have
the inventory.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.144
Which means Donna Merritt does.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.746
We need to find her.

33:40.419 --> 33:43.353
All right, thanks, Eric, let us
know if you find anything.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.256
No luck?

33:46.258 --> 33:48.492
Eric can't locate
Merritt's car.

33:48.494 --> 33:50.327
She turned her cell phone off.
Great.

33:50.329 --> 33:52.062
'Cause we're gonna be here
all day and night

33:52.064 --> 33:53.697
sifting through all this stuff.

33:53.699 --> 33:56.333
Well, we still may
not know where she went.

33:56.335 --> 33:57.768
This is why I keep my
place lean and mean.

33:57.770 --> 33:59.503
You need to find
something at my house...

33:59.505 --> 34:01.405
Which I have.
...it's all right there.

34:01.407 --> 34:02.506
You'll find it.

34:02.508 --> 34:04.641
Behind fake walls
and a steel vault.

34:08.347 --> 34:10.580
What?

34:10.582 --> 34:13.316
How did Donna Merritt
make it this far?

34:13.318 --> 34:15.218
By betraying her country
and joining forces

34:15.220 --> 34:17.521
with a violent criminal.

34:17.522 --> 34:19.823
But she never got caught because
she always hides in plain sight.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.260
And what's the safest place
she can go right now?

34:23.262 --> 34:25.362
Back to Homeland Security.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.364
She knows that Zhang Kiu

34:27.366 --> 34:29.332
is after her, but she doesn't
know we are, too.

34:29.334 --> 34:32.302
DHS is the last place
someone would expect to see

34:32.304 --> 34:35.272
a stash of black market meds.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.275
(line rings)

34:38.277 --> 34:40.077
DEEKS:
Callen.
Deeks,

34:40.079 --> 34:42.079
you and Nell meet us
at the DHS Fusion Center.

34:42.081 --> 34:43.146
Got it.

34:53.792 --> 34:56.560
Eric says the office
space should be empty.

34:56.562 --> 34:58.228
Could be where Merritt
stashed her goods.

34:58.230 --> 35:00.330
Let's hope she
hasn't moved them yet.

35:00.332 --> 35:01.598
WOMAN:
Hey!

35:01.599 --> 35:02.865
MAN: Keep moving.
WOMAN: Let go. Hey!

35:02.868 --> 35:04.668
MAN:
Hurry!

35:06.271 --> 35:07.604
It's Merritt.

35:07.606 --> 35:08.872
SAM:
It's Zhang Kiu's friends.

35:14.780 --> 35:16.413
Go around and cut them off.

35:16.415 --> 35:17.581
DEEKS:
On it!

35:25.691 --> 35:28.692
Uh... guys?

35:28.694 --> 35:29.693
If this is where Merritt

35:29.695 --> 35:30.660
kept all her pills and purses...

35:30.662 --> 35:32.662
They're already gone.
Yeah.

35:32.664 --> 35:34.731
Let's move.

35:38.504 --> 35:40.704
First things first.

35:41.673 --> 35:42.706
(both grunting)

35:46.578 --> 35:48.578
Cover me.

35:50.682 --> 35:52.382
(gunfire)

36:00.759 --> 36:02.559
(man grunts, gun clatters
on the floor)

36:02.561 --> 36:03.894
(body thuds)

36:03.896 --> 36:06.596
(gun slides across floor)

36:06.598 --> 36:07.898
Take the front.

36:14.173 --> 36:15.805
(Donna and men panting)

36:22.181 --> 36:23.747
That's a terrible plan.

36:23.749 --> 36:25.315
(grunting and panting softly)

36:36.828 --> 36:37.494
(both grunt)

36:37.496 --> 36:40.497
Ow.

36:41.767 --> 36:43.800
Nell, I got one.

36:45.704 --> 36:46.836
Nell?

36:48.373 --> 36:50.440
(both grunting)

36:50.442 --> 36:51.775
(man choking)

36:57.749 --> 36:59.316
Wow, Nell-osaurus.

36:59.318 --> 37:00.717
Nice.

37:00.719 --> 37:01.718
You good?
Good.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.386
Merritt went that way.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.488
Good, good, good work.

37:08.493 --> 37:09.826
Drop your weapon.

37:12.798 --> 37:13.797
SAM:
He's won't ask you twice.

37:13.799 --> 37:15.498
Trust me.

37:15.500 --> 37:17.734
(footsteps approaching)

37:24.309 --> 37:25.842
So, let me get this straight,
we just risked our lives

37:25.844 --> 37:27.677
to protect a known traitor?

37:27.679 --> 37:29.246
Well, when you
put it like that...
Yeah.

37:29.248 --> 37:31.381
SAM:
Yes.

37:31.383 --> 37:33.350
She has information we need.

37:33.352 --> 37:35.785
Plus, our way will be
more painful in the end.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.887
Hope it was worth it.

37:40.659 --> 37:42.459
That's a textbook choke.
Where'd you learn that?

37:42.461 --> 37:43.593
Um... a textbook.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.996
Oh, touché.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.943
Assistant Director.

38:01.647 --> 38:04.514
Merritt just told me where she
stashed all of her contraband

38:04.516 --> 38:06.783
in exchange for
a more lenient sentence.

38:06.785 --> 38:07.851
Really?

38:07.853 --> 38:09.019
Or so she thinks.

38:09.021 --> 38:10.854
(chuckles)

38:10.856 --> 38:12.689
How'd it go out there today?

38:12.691 --> 38:15.558
Good.

38:15.560 --> 38:18.662
And... also complicated.

38:18.664 --> 38:20.664
Hmm.
How so?

38:20.666 --> 38:23.433
Well, you know, I have...

38:23.435 --> 38:25.735
pretty big shoes to fill.

38:25.737 --> 38:27.504
That's true.

38:27.506 --> 38:30.807
And I want to step up, I do,
it's not that, I mean...

38:30.809 --> 38:32.676
you know, I want to
be there for Deeks.

38:32.678 --> 38:33.843
But...

38:33.845 --> 38:36.846
the truth is, I...

38:36.848 --> 38:38.648
I can't stop thinking
about the reason

38:38.650 --> 38:40.417
why I'm getting my chance now.

38:40.419 --> 38:42.819
Is that why you're
returning your weapon?

38:43.822 --> 38:45.822
Well...

38:45.824 --> 38:48.825
I heard you were looking
for a replacement for Kensi.

38:48.827 --> 38:50.493
Maybe.

38:50.495 --> 38:51.728
Maybe not.

38:51.730 --> 38:55.565
But let's get
one thing straight.

38:55.567 --> 38:57.534
You were not there today
to replace Kensi.

38:57.536 --> 38:59.736
You were there to honor her.

39:02.474 --> 39:03.473
(softly):
Okay.

39:03.475 --> 39:05.442
(chuckles)

39:05.444 --> 39:08.678
Well, good night,
Assistant Director.

39:10.916 --> 39:11.981
Hey, Jones.

39:14.019 --> 39:19.456
One more thing, from here on
out, let's just make it Granger.

39:19.458 --> 39:20.724
Okay?

39:20.726 --> 39:22.926
I don't know.

39:22.928 --> 39:26.062
Sir, I think that
might be kind of weird.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.567
Sorry.

39:30.569 --> 39:32.068
It's an order.

39:34.506 --> 39:38.541
Okay.
(chuckles)

39:41.747 --> 39:43.780
WOMAN (over P.A. system):
Dr. Wilson to cardiology.

39:43.782 --> 39:45.482
Dr. Wilson to cardiology.

39:57.596 --> 40:00.530
Mr. Deeks?

40:00.532 --> 40:03.133
Mr. Deeks?
(groans)

40:06.805 --> 40:07.804
Martin!

40:07.806 --> 40:09.839
Did I miss the bus?

40:09.841 --> 40:10.707
(yells)

40:10.709 --> 40:11.875
You're not my mom.

40:11.877 --> 40:13.510
Oh, hell no.

40:16.848 --> 40:19.115
Sorry, it's freezing in here.

40:19.117 --> 40:21.518
How's our girl?

40:21.520 --> 40:23.687
She's pretty much the same.

40:23.688 --> 40:25.855
Responded a little bit to pain,
which they think, you know,

40:25.857 --> 40:28.425
that may be a good sign, so...

40:28.427 --> 40:30.660
Why don't you go home and
get a good night's sleep?

40:30.662 --> 40:33.496
I'll stay with her
for a while.

40:35.801 --> 40:39.002
You sure about that?

40:39.004 --> 40:41.738
Well, with Kensi gone,

40:41.740 --> 40:44.841
I need you on your
game more than ever.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.143
Hmm. Okay.

40:49.214 --> 40:50.814
(inhales)

40:50.816 --> 40:53.216
Hon.

40:53.218 --> 40:55.919
I'll see you in the morning.

40:57.456 --> 40:59.522
I love you.

41:00.859 --> 41:02.926
All right.

41:04.196 --> 41:05.829
Good night, Hetty.

41:05.831 --> 41:08.798
Good night, Martin.

41:08.800 --> 41:10.967
Easy with the "Martin."

41:17.709 --> 41:20.777
Oh...

41:20.779 --> 41:24.747
I know you've
been through a lot.

41:27.252 --> 41:29.986
We need you now.

41:29.988 --> 41:32.055
It's time for you to wake up.

41:35.126 --> 41:39.496
Can you squeeze my hand?

41:46.204 --> 41:50.874
Squeeze my hand, Ms. Blye.

41:50.876 --> 41:52.542
That's an order.

41:52.544 --> 41:54.911
I'm won't say it again.

42:01.887 --> 42:03.853
Again.

42:07.225 --> 42:08.291
You rest now.
