01:00.603 --> 01:03.272
(Echoing footsteps)

01:23.209 --> 01:25.127
(Thunder roars)

01:29.757 --> 01:33.385
(Hovering sound)

03:03.851 --> 03:06.562
'Where he came from, nobody knows.

03:09.023 --> 03:11.650
'His evil spread like a plague...

03:12.526 --> 03:14.528
'destroying towns...

03:15.571 --> 03:18.407
'maiming and killing.

03:20.075 --> 03:22.494
'We called him The Tall Man.

03:24.663 --> 03:27.917
'At first we thought
he was just an undertaker.

03:28.000 --> 03:32.463
'His hordes pillaged graveyards,
rooted up the bodies...

03:33.756 --> 03:38.093
'and spirited off the dead
to a place worse than hell.

03:42.431 --> 03:44.475
'We were just three friends.

03:46.727 --> 03:52.149
'Jody was taken from us, turned by
The Tall Man into an alien form.

03:54.026 --> 03:58.280
'His younger brother Mike
I've tried to protect as he's grown.

03:59.240 --> 04:03.202
'The Tall Man wants
to transform him into one of his kind.

04:06.580 --> 04:10.751
'My name is Reggie.
I was an ice-cream vendor by trade.

04:10.876 --> 04:13.420
'Now... I'm a soldier...

04:14.463 --> 04:19.468
'a soldier in a war against
his army of the living dead.

04:22.388 --> 04:27.810
'On his own, Mike fled into the wastelands,
trying to escape the transformation

04:27.893 --> 04:30.145
'that was taking place inside him.

04:30.229 --> 04:35.693
'His only hope was to somehow uncover
the mysteries of The Tall Man.

04:35.776 --> 04:40.739
'As for me, I was left deep in the catacombs
of The Tall Man's lair.

04:40.823 --> 04:43.450
'Mike left me hanging.'

05:27.244 --> 05:33.667
Small man, your end approaches
but it is not yet.

05:33.751 --> 05:37.004
Take great care how you play.

05:37.087 --> 05:41.175
The final game now begins.

06:31.892 --> 06:36.897
(Mike) 'Reggie, I've been moving
southeast for three days now.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.275
'I know he's behind me somewhere.

06:41.193 --> 06:43.445
'Don't try to come after me.

06:43.529 --> 06:46.782
'There's very little left alive
out here any more.

06:46.865 --> 06:49.284
'The towns have all been abandoned.

06:50.869 --> 06:52.913
'Do you remember our old town?

06:54.123 --> 06:57.126
'That last perfect day before he came?

07:58.812 --> 08:01.523
'It was the very next day that he arrived.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.818
'I remember, Reggie.

08:05.903 --> 08:08.405
'I was with my brother.'

08:16.663 --> 08:17.998
(Barking)

08:44.816 --> 08:46.652
(Thumping and yelping)

08:50.364 --> 08:52.199
'Where are you, brother?

08:53.283 --> 08:55.327
'What's become of you?'

08:56.620 --> 08:58.080
Jody died in a car wreck.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.509
(Horn blasts)

09:42.666 --> 09:44.501
(Gasps)

09:47.879 --> 09:49.548
(Cackles)

11:17.552 --> 11:20.347
- Hey, Reg.
- Goddamn it.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.600
Not you again.

11:25.227 --> 11:29.272
Why don't you just get the hell away
from me, man? I'm done with you.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.400
That's a fine, "How ya been?" Reg.

11:31.483 --> 11:36.488
If you think I'm going to help you find your
brother Mike, you're wrong, dead wrong.

11:36.571 --> 11:39.950
You're his only friend.
He can't make it without you.

11:40.867 --> 11:43.120
I wish things had been different...

11:44.538 --> 11:46.373
but they're not.

12:01.638 --> 12:05.767
No. Forget it. I'm done with that shit.

12:05.892 --> 12:09.646
And besides, I thought you said
you were going to stay in touch later.

12:09.730 --> 12:12.983
Like, later being the operative word here.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.777
Well, as it turns out, we need you sooner.

12:15.861 --> 12:20.866
I'm going after Mike now but I know
for sure we're going to need some backup,

12:20.949 --> 12:22.993
from somebody he trusts.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.663
Not me. Besides,
I wouldn't know where to look.

12:26.788 --> 12:30.333
You just keep driving southwest
a few hundred miles

12:30.417 --> 12:32.669
and it'll become pretty obvious.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.796
No thanks, Jody.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.843
Not to mention the damage to my car.

12:39.926 --> 12:45.682
I mean... the convertible roof,
the tyres all messed up.

12:47.392 --> 12:52.022
And look at what that zombie bitch did
to my lacquer paint job.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.358
Goddamn it.

13:06.328 --> 13:11.166
Well... I guess I know where I'm going, huh?

13:35.106 --> 13:36.066
(Gasps)

13:42.280 --> 13:44.032
No.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.451
Yes, boy.

14:18.775 --> 14:21.278
The coach will drive itself.

14:32.914 --> 14:34.958
(Radio crackles)

14:49.806 --> 14:51.474
God damn you to hell.

14:52.767 --> 14:54.853
Not possible.

14:56.521 --> 15:00.609
- Where are you taking me?
- Where you belong.

15:00.734 --> 15:05.739
This experience may seem strange to you,
this evolution,

15:05.822 --> 15:07.991
as you prepare for passage.

15:08.116 --> 15:11.828
I still have a friend. He'll follow and find me.

15:11.953 --> 15:16.082
You have no one... but me.

16:08.176 --> 16:10.053
(Siren)

16:15.934 --> 16:17.978
Son of a bitch.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.356
- Just what I need.
- (Car engine stops)

16:21.439 --> 16:24.442
Now I've got to deal with a
fucking over-amped cop.

16:25.986 --> 16:28.029
Shit.

16:40.917 --> 16:42.794
Licence and registration.

18:14.344 --> 18:16.012
(Radio crackles)

18:41.121 --> 18:43.164
(Soft thumping)

18:44.332 --> 18:46.292
What the hell?

18:55.635 --> 18:57.512
(Muffled moans)

19:17.699 --> 19:21.161
(Shivers) Don't kill me. Don't...

19:21.286 --> 19:22.954
Don't kill me.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.040
Ah. Ah.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.585
(Growls)

19:28.710 --> 19:30.170
Aow!

19:30.253 --> 19:32.338
- (Splatter)
- Oh!

19:43.558 --> 19:45.518
(Chuckles) Fuck you!

20:06.080 --> 20:08.124
Come on.

20:19.636 --> 20:21.638
(Growling)

20:33.691 --> 20:34.901
Blow me.

20:49.165 --> 20:51.251
Huh?

20:52.919 --> 20:54.337
Urgh!

21:08.476 --> 21:10.520
Oh! Oh!

21:17.527 --> 21:19.445
Oh, no.

21:43.511 --> 21:45.179
(Squelching)

21:49.017 --> 21:51.269
(Means)

22:54.916 --> 22:56.959
Wow.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.754
Some cops can be real assholes.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.594
(Groans)

24:33.055 --> 24:35.141
(Shuffling)

26:11.904 --> 26:16.242
'Reggie, I don't yet know
why he's brought me here.

26:17.785 --> 26:22.039
'It feels like I'm at
ground zero of his experiment.

26:23.583 --> 26:26.502
'There is one escape from him, though.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.421
'And I've got a plan.

26:29.422 --> 26:33.134
'When the sun comes up,
I'm going to force him out.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.597
'See if I can take him down with me.'

26:37.722 --> 26:40.099
(Distant eerie cries)

26:43.436 --> 26:45.396
(Echoing cannon fire)

26:46.522 --> 26:48.566
(Moans softly)

26:57.450 --> 27:03.789
Let me release you from this imperfect flesh
that ties you to time and space.

27:04.707 --> 27:09.170
All that is unknown
will be known to you once more.

27:12.965 --> 27:15.009
(Whirring)

27:42.536 --> 27:44.580
(Groans)

27:48.626 --> 27:51.629
(Booming of cannons and rattle of rifle fire)

27:51.712 --> 27:53.756
(Men shouting)

28:31.419 --> 28:32.461
(Squelching)

28:32.586 --> 28:34.588
(Muffled groans)

28:34.672 --> 28:36.716
(Muffled screams)

28:41.303 --> 28:43.264
(Boom of cannon fire fades)

29:17.882 --> 29:19.925
(Distant electronic humming)

29:35.065 --> 29:37.026
(Electronic hum)

30:26.408 --> 30:28.369
(Engaged tone)

32:22.858 --> 32:24.902
(Distant cawing of crows)

32:31.700 --> 32:34.954
(The Tall Man) 'Where do you think
you're going, boy?

32:36.246 --> 32:40.000
'Death is no escape from me.'

33:42.187 --> 33:43.564
(Groans)

34:00.164 --> 34:02.207
(Crows cawing)

34:28.900 --> 34:34.364
(Ghostly whispering) 'Cut me down, boy.

34:34.447 --> 34:38.159
'Cut me down, boy.

34:40.746 --> 34:44.291
'Cut me down, boy. (Echoes)

34:57.888 --> 34:59.932
'Boy...'

35:46.937 --> 35:49.189
Cut me down, boy!

35:51.316 --> 35:52.651
No!

35:52.776 --> 35:54.736
Cut me down!

35:54.862 --> 35:56.947
No!

35:58.323 --> 36:00.367
I won't hurt you.

36:04.163 --> 36:06.331
You're killing the world.

36:09.168 --> 36:14.423
I'll go away and I won't ever come back.

36:18.427 --> 36:19.761
You will?

36:22.347 --> 36:24.391
Yes.

36:53.795 --> 36:55.964
Boy!

37:01.595 --> 37:03.639
(Crows cawing)

37:08.560 --> 37:10.604
(Groans)

37:30.374 --> 37:36.046
I've been waiting for you for a very long time.

37:40.592 --> 37:45.222
And no, you may not take your own life.

37:45.305 --> 37:48.016
That is my domain, exclusively.

37:53.522 --> 37:55.565
Come, boy.

37:55.649 --> 37:57.442
We have things to do.

38:30.142 --> 38:32.477
Careful what you look for.

38:38.525 --> 38:41.111
You just might find it.

38:42.654 --> 38:45.949
(Electronic humming, machinery clanking)

39:37.709 --> 39:39.753
(Distant horse neighing)

40:33.390 --> 40:35.559
Can I assist you?

40:38.103 --> 40:39.855
Have we met?

40:39.980 --> 40:43.942
I don't believe so. Have you travelled far?

40:46.027 --> 40:48.113
Wouldn't you like to sit down?

40:48.196 --> 40:50.615
But let me offer you some lemonade.

40:54.286 --> 40:58.748
We don't receive many visitors
and your clothes are different.

40:58.832 --> 41:01.835
You don't look like you're from around here.

41:05.464 --> 41:08.800
Did you make passage
through the dimensional fork?

41:10.427 --> 41:12.471
You're him, right?

41:12.554 --> 41:15.557
Jebediah. Jebediah Morningside.

41:16.475 --> 41:21.730
I've been waiting for someone,
someone like you.

41:21.813 --> 41:23.982
Jebediah.

41:26.026 --> 41:29.779
Please, don't leave.
There's so much you can tell us.

41:29.863 --> 41:32.115
Things we need desperately to know.

41:33.033 --> 41:34.493
Hmm.

41:34.576 --> 41:36.620
(Cackles)

42:15.867 --> 42:17.911
(Electronic humming)

43:45.874 --> 43:47.375
(Tyres screech)

43:53.632 --> 43:55.717
Oh, man.

43:56.843 --> 43:58.887
Jesus Christ.

44:02.515 --> 44:04.559
My God.

44:08.688 --> 44:12.150
Help me! Help me!
Help me get out of here!

44:12.233 --> 44:14.653
Oh! Help me, please!

44:14.736 --> 44:17.530
Help me. Please, God, please...

44:17.614 --> 44:19.157
Get me out!

44:19.282 --> 44:21.451
- Oh!
- Help me, please!

44:25.163 --> 44:28.875
- Let me out! Get me out of here!
- Get back! Cover your eyes!

44:30.585 --> 44:33.380
- Help me. Let me out.
- Give me your hand.

44:34.798 --> 44:36.966
(Groans)

44:37.092 --> 44:40.470
We gotta move away from the car
before the gas tank blows.

44:40.553 --> 44:42.389
(Groans)

44:43.223 --> 44:47.185
Wait. I thought cars only blew up
like that in the movies.

44:49.938 --> 44:51.981
Yeah. Me too.

46:21.905 --> 46:23.531
(Jody) Hey, brother.

46:24.449 --> 46:26.326
I was wondering when you'd show up.

46:27.327 --> 46:31.206
- You can't stay here.
- I don't see many options.

46:31.289 --> 46:33.082
What's wrong? Can't you fix it?

46:33.208 --> 46:35.960
I'm not trying to. I've got other plans.

46:46.387 --> 46:48.431
Hey, what are you anyway?

46:49.474 --> 46:51.476
I thought you were my brother.

46:51.559 --> 46:53.978
Reggie said you died in that car wreck.

46:54.062 --> 46:56.105
No. That was a lie.

46:58.650 --> 47:00.902
But I remember the funeral.

47:00.985 --> 47:05.240
Mom and Dad. Seemed so real.

47:32.225 --> 47:34.310
So what is it with you, brother?

47:35.311 --> 47:37.355
Are you alive or are you dead?

47:42.735 --> 47:44.988
You know, Reggie, I can count on.

47:45.989 --> 47:48.408
Reggie's always been there for me.

47:49.868 --> 47:51.911
But you...

47:57.250 --> 47:59.294
You I can't trust.

48:01.462 --> 48:05.174
My clothes, my money...

48:06.217 --> 48:08.261
my car.

48:18.104 --> 48:20.189
My name's Jennifer, by the way.

48:21.107 --> 48:23.443
Thanks for pulling my ass out of the fire.

48:25.653 --> 48:27.989
I'm Reggie.

48:28.072 --> 48:29.908
Come on, it's getting dark.

48:29.991 --> 48:32.327
Hop in. I'll give you a lift to the next town.

49:04.567 --> 49:08.279
You can't imagine
what I went through to get back here.

49:08.363 --> 49:10.990
Let me guess. Seeing is easy.

49:11.074 --> 49:13.701
Understanding takes a little more time.

49:13.785 --> 49:15.828
Right?

49:15.912 --> 49:19.165
I didn't abandon you, Mike. I was taken.

49:19.290 --> 49:21.376
(Thunder)

49:43.606 --> 49:45.650
(Distant thunder)

50:04.502 --> 50:08.214
(Electronic humming)

50:08.339 --> 50:10.508
(Loud humming)

51:23.748 --> 51:27.543
Well, this looks affordable.

51:30.838 --> 51:33.174
You've gotta be kidding.

51:34.967 --> 51:37.011
Jen...

51:37.095 --> 51:38.805
I can call you Jen, right?

51:41.808 --> 51:46.437
Look, Jen, I've been on the road
for uh... 16 hours straight.

51:46.521 --> 51:48.689
One more minute and it could get ugly.

51:49.982 --> 51:53.903
Now, I've got a couple
of sleeping bags in the trunk

51:54.028 --> 51:56.781
and we can just camp out here till dawn.

51:56.864 --> 51:59.575
At least it'll get us in
out of the wind, OK?

51:59.659 --> 52:02.078
And then I'll take you to the next town.

52:06.624 --> 52:10.086
OK, I'll take you to the next inhabited town.

52:14.423 --> 52:16.175
All right.

52:41.450 --> 52:43.536
(Door creaks)

52:53.838 --> 52:57.008
(Jen) This place reminds me
of a club I used to dance in.

52:58.259 --> 53:00.011
Hey, wait a minute.

53:00.136 --> 53:03.890
Look. We've got 24-hour room service.

53:05.433 --> 53:07.852
And uh... look over here.

53:07.935 --> 53:12.565
Our media centre boasts
49 satellite stations.

53:15.943 --> 53:17.737
Uh, how about this? Look.

53:17.820 --> 53:22.783
You dial three
and you've got the health club and spa.

53:22.867 --> 53:23.868
Hello?

53:26.537 --> 53:29.707
Well, it's not exactly the honeymoon suite.

53:32.043 --> 53:34.670
But then again this isn't a honeymoon.

53:34.754 --> 53:36.589
Is it?

53:41.802 --> 53:43.846
(Wind whistles)

54:07.620 --> 54:12.708
So you're telling me there's some Tall Man
clearing out entire towns

54:12.792 --> 54:14.126
and he's got your friend.

54:14.252 --> 54:16.545
Yeah.

54:16.629 --> 54:18.881
I've been tracking him for years.

54:20.132 --> 54:22.385
He's one tough hombre too.

54:24.262 --> 54:27.056
He's got these little dwarf critters...

54:28.808 --> 54:32.436
and he uh... shrinks them down from...

54:33.229 --> 54:34.480
What?

54:35.773 --> 54:40.903
Yeah. Haven't you wondered why
you haven't seen anyone all day?

54:44.198 --> 54:46.534
Can't you feel the stillness in the air?

54:48.452 --> 54:50.496
The Tall Man's real.

54:50.579 --> 54:52.456
And...

54:54.875 --> 54:56.752
And...

54:56.836 --> 54:58.671
And uh...

54:58.754 --> 55:04.135
I think he wants nothing better than
to populate our world with the undead.

55:05.553 --> 55:07.054
No way.

55:09.890 --> 55:12.059
In your dreams, Reggie.

55:12.184 --> 55:14.270
If you only knew.

55:15.271 --> 55:19.734
Nightmares aren't real, you know,
and neither is your Tall Man.

55:21.193 --> 55:25.197
Give me one of your shirts, will you?
Mine's too rank to sleep in.

55:25.281 --> 55:27.533
Yeah, sure.

55:27.616 --> 55:30.244
I think I've got a spare here somewhere.

55:31.370 --> 55:36.000
You know, you really shouldn't dismiss
the Tall Man as just some sort of ghost story.

55:36.083 --> 55:38.252
If you've seen some of the stuff I've seen,

55:38.377 --> 55:43.049
you wouldn't be able to deny the evidence
that's right in front of your... face.

55:43.132 --> 55:44.759
Thanks.

55:46.886 --> 55:48.929
Believe what you want.

55:50.014 --> 55:52.266
But I'm telling you I've seen him.

55:53.351 --> 55:55.394
I've lost friends to him.

55:56.479 --> 56:00.900
Lady, I may not be the sharpest knife
in the drawer but I can tell you this,

56:00.983 --> 56:03.027
that old bastard's going down.

56:04.028 --> 56:08.657
I don't give a damn what fucking planet
or dimension he's from.

56:08.741 --> 56:10.785
His balls are mine.

56:17.458 --> 56:19.418
Reggie.

56:21.587 --> 56:23.672
You sound so demented.

56:25.674 --> 56:28.677
Yeah. I guess I do.

56:32.264 --> 56:35.267
So, anyway...

56:40.231 --> 56:41.774
I like you, Reg.

56:43.192 --> 56:45.236
And that was a great story.

56:46.362 --> 56:49.615
But I make it a policy
never to get personal with someone

56:49.698 --> 56:51.784
who has more problems than I do.

56:53.828 --> 56:55.538
Yeah but I don't...

56:56.705 --> 56:58.541
Sweet dreams.

57:09.802 --> 57:11.846
(Mutters)

57:53.471 --> 57:55.514
(Child laughing)

58:21.415 --> 58:23.459
(Child laughing)

58:55.241 --> 58:57.326
Mike!

59:32.069 --> 59:34.697
(Squelching)

59:41.912 --> 59:43.998
Far out.

59:56.385 --> 59:58.554
(Gasps)

01:00:00.848 --> 01:00:02.808
You want to get it on, Reggie?

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:05.019
Oh, no. No!

01:00:07.563 --> 01:00:09.106
(Pants and groans)

01:00:11.442 --> 01:00:12.735
(Yells)

01:00:12.860 --> 01:00:14.945
Argh!

01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:41.055
Oh. Oh.

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:57.529
Thought you had me, son of a bitch?

01:01:00.616 --> 01:01:02.660
- Ow!
- (Whirring)

01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:05.245
- Aah!
- (Squelching)

01:01:05.371 --> 01:01:07.873
Argh!

01:01:22.137 --> 01:01:24.056
(Note rings out)

01:01:35.317 --> 01:01:37.403
(Note rings out)

01:01:44.118 --> 01:01:46.161
(Groans)

01:02:06.432 --> 01:02:09.435
Wait! We're not done yet!

01:02:11.061 --> 01:02:13.313
(Snarls)

01:02:14.273 --> 01:02:17.985
Sorry, baby, but yes, we are.

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:20.529
(Thumping and squelching)

01:02:21.447 --> 01:02:23.699
'Dear Reggie,

01:02:23.782 --> 01:02:26.869
'today I was able to conjure
one of his dimensional forks

01:02:26.952 --> 01:02:29.747
'and discovered something astonishing.

01:02:30.664 --> 01:02:34.918
'In another time, I believe I met him

01:02:35.002 --> 01:02:38.505
'If only I could return there
and somehow change things.

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:45.429
'We know that he can't be killed
but could he be stopped from ever existing?'

01:02:48.098 --> 01:02:49.975
(Electronic humming)

01:02:58.567 --> 01:03:03.197
(The Tall Man) 'You go
where I want you to go, boy.'

01:03:07.284 --> 01:03:09.328
Oh!

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:43.946
(Echoing footsteps)

01:04:03.924 --> 01:04:05.342
Hey!

01:04:05.425 --> 01:04:08.053
You found me. He's right behind me.
He's coming.

01:04:08.136 --> 01:04:10.305
- There's a way out.
- What is this place?

01:04:10.430 --> 01:04:12.307
You mean when.

01:04:12.391 --> 01:04:15.644
We can't stay here.
There's a risk of infection.

01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:30.344
Oh, yeah.

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:00.851
Mike?

01:07:02.144 --> 01:07:03.979
(Groans)

01:07:14.031 --> 01:07:16.074
(Metallic click of machinery)

01:07:21.371 --> 01:07:25.375
(Metallic clicking)

01:07:41.975 --> 01:07:43.935
(Clicking and whirring)

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.569
(Bubbling)

01:08:37.029 --> 01:08:39.073
(Sniffs)

01:09:11.398 --> 01:09:13.441
(Ghostly gunshot)

01:09:15.484 --> 01:09:17.529
He'll be coming for you soon.

01:09:18.738 --> 01:09:20.823
(Gunshot echoes)

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:28.622
It's Reggie.

01:09:35.005 --> 01:09:36.965
(Roaring)

01:09:45.307 --> 01:09:46.850
(Roaring)

01:10:09.539 --> 01:10:10.707
(Roaring)

01:10:27.766 --> 01:10:29.809
Always sneaking round.

01:10:33.813 --> 01:10:38.068
Yeah, I'm getting really good
at killing you little motherfuckers.

01:10:42.405 --> 01:10:44.366
Mike.

01:10:44.449 --> 01:10:45.951
Mike.

01:10:46.076 --> 01:10:48.370
Hey, Mike, I found you guys.

01:10:49.454 --> 01:10:52.082
- Hey, Jody.
- Reg.

01:10:52.916 --> 01:10:54.876
(Whispers) Don't trust him, Reggie.

01:10:56.753 --> 01:10:59.673
Stay here. There's something I need to do.

01:11:15.981 --> 01:11:18.233
I need to go back to the beginning.

01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:20.277
Back where it all started.

01:11:22.988 --> 01:11:25.031
Let's go.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:41.715
(Wind whistles)

01:11:43.883 --> 01:11:46.011
(Jody) 'This is the night, Mike.

01:11:47.721 --> 01:11:49.973
'The night when it all started.

01:11:51.808 --> 01:11:57.397
'As undertaker, he bore witness
to the stark passage from life to death.

'But the more he put in the grave,
the more questions he had.

01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:10.035
'He came to the conclusion
that the answers were before him.

01:12:11.619 --> 01:12:16.499
'Hidden in subjects

'vibration, warmth and cold.

'It became his life's work, his passion...

'to learn the craft, find the rift...

(Machinery clunking)

01:14:13.366 --> 01:14:15.535
You can't affect him.

01:14:17.245 --> 01:14:19.497
We're not in the same dimension.

01:14:22.876 --> 01:14:24.377
When's he coming back?

01:14:24.502 --> 01:14:28.173
Jebediah Morningside
never does come back.

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:03.500
And so it begins.

01:15:10.006 --> 01:15:12.050
Mike?

01:15:12.133 --> 01:15:14.177
Over here.

01:15:30.068 --> 01:15:32.320
I knew you'd find me here.

01:15:36.282 --> 01:15:38.535
What's happening, brother?

01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:45.333
(Whirring)

01:15:48.461 --> 01:15:49.921
(Squelching)

01:15:50.046 --> 01:15:51.464
Aow!

01:15:51.589 --> 01:15:53.508
Just had to be sure...

01:15:58.638 --> 01:16:00.807
before I killed my own brother.

01:16:09.774 --> 01:16:11.818
Or what's left of him.

01:16:15.822 --> 01:16:17.865
I won't be like you.

01:16:28.960 --> 01:16:30.795
Hah!

01:16:41.472 --> 01:16:43.516
(Footsteps echo)

01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:08.041
Now, this won't hurt a bit.

01:17:08.166 --> 01:17:10.335
(Clicking and whirring)

01:17:11.169 --> 01:17:14.130
Well, maybe just a little bit.

01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:18.885
Argh! Argh! Argh!

01:17:32.899 --> 01:17:34.776
(Note rings out)

01:17:40.657 --> 01:17:42.825
Argh!

01:17:44.035 --> 01:17:46.079
(Note rings out)

01:17:51.292 --> 01:17:53.169
I died...

01:17:58.466 --> 01:18:01.678
I died in the car, Mike.

01:18:50.727 --> 01:18:52.854
- Reg.
- Mike.

01:18:54.981 --> 01:18:57.024
Jody's dead.

01:18:59.485 --> 01:19:02.071
You don't have another one
of those tuning forks, do you?

01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:05.908
He's coming for me.

01:19:06.033 --> 01:19:10.788
He's going to rip open my skull
and there's nothing I can do about it.

01:19:10.872 --> 01:19:12.707
It'll be OK, pal.

01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:14.834
Here, just stand behind me.

01:19:15.710 --> 01:19:17.462
The Cuda's stashed a mile away.

01:19:17.545 --> 01:19:20.089
Once we get to that bitch,
nothing can stop us.

01:19:20.173 --> 01:19:24.427
Anything that tries is going to get
a hot introduction to my four friends here.

01:19:24.510 --> 01:19:26.095
Thanks for standing with me, Reg.

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:30.308
Don't mention it.

01:19:34.937 --> 01:19:37.106
Oh, shit.

01:19:53.206 --> 01:19:55.082
(Gun clicks)

01:19:59.837 --> 01:20:02.089
What do you want?

01:20:02.173 --> 01:20:06.093
Ice cream man, it's all in his head.

01:20:08.012 --> 01:20:10.014
Ah!

01:20:15.394 --> 01:20:17.647
It's time now, boy.

01:20:19.106 --> 01:20:21.400
Yes...

01:20:21.484 --> 01:20:23.194
it is.

01:20:46.384 --> 01:20:47.844
A toy.

01:21:08.322 --> 01:21:09.991
Mike!

01:21:47.695 --> 01:21:48.946
(Groaning)

01:22:02.001 --> 01:22:04.045
(Ghostly groaning)

01:22:20.394 --> 01:22:21.979
No.

01:22:47.672 --> 01:22:49.966
(Squelching)

01:22:50.049 --> 01:22:52.301
Ah! Ah!

01:22:52.385 --> 01:22:54.929
(Screaming)

01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:47.064

01:23:47.148 --> 01:23:49.400
Mike? Mike?

01:23:49.483 --> 01:23:51.110
You're still alive.

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:55.031
I'm dying, Reg.

01:23:56.323 --> 01:23:58.576
No, don't let go.

01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:07.460
I'll be coming right back for you.

(Reggie echoes) 'Mike! Mike!

01:24:59.887 --> 01:25:02.139
'You're still alive...'

01:25:11.107 --> 01:25:13.484

- Hi.

It's just the wind.
