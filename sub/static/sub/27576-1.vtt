Previously on "Heartland"...

00:02.230 --> 00:04.129
- How much time do you have?
- I don't know.

00:04.182 --> 00:06.016
The doctors at home

00:06.332 --> 00:07.797
think that I might have cancer.

00:07.916 --> 00:11.280
Now let's welcome
this beautiful baby,

00:11.346 --> 00:13.909
and bless her with her name,
and stone.

00:14.010 --> 00:15.943
Yay!

00:17.013 --> 00:18.780
I was just calling to make
sure that you hadn't gone

00:18.881 --> 00:20.716
- on the gossip site.
- No, I haven't.

00:20.817 --> 00:22.584
She'd even hurt
her horse to win!

00:22.685 --> 00:23.985
Nobody likes you,
Georgie!

00:24.087 --> 00:25.987
I mean, this is only
the beginning

00:26.089 --> 00:27.989
of your American expansion,
you guys are planning

00:28.091 --> 00:29.524
on opening up other locations,
right?

00:29.625 --> 00:32.527
- Yeah, we have discussed it.
- The bottom line is that...

00:32.628 --> 00:33.929
you're not gonna be around here,

00:34.030 --> 00:35.797
and I'd never be happy
in New York.

00:35.898 --> 00:37.799
The winner
of the Fall Finale,

00:37.900 --> 00:39.101
Georgie Fleming-Morris...

00:39.202 --> 00:40.969
Way to go, Georgie!

00:41.070 --> 00:43.071
on Phoenix Rising.

00:43.172 --> 00:46.174
I promised I'd keep you
in the loop about my health.

00:46.275 --> 00:48.110
- I'm clear.
- Dad!

00:48.211 --> 00:50.112
Good news, such good news!

Come on, Bandit. Come on.

02:25.741 --> 02:27.742
Good boy.

02:45.728 --> 02:47.095
Hey! Hey, easy.

02:48.197 --> 02:50.932
Ooh! Ah!

02:57.874 --> 02:59.774
Come on, you had this!

03:03.212 --> 03:05.149
Settle.

03:16.993 --> 03:18.560
- There she is!
- Mommy!

03:18.661 --> 03:21.596
Hey Grandpa, I'm so sorry
that time got away from me.

03:21.697 --> 03:24.099
- No problem.
- Hi, sweetheart!

03:24.200 --> 03:25.967
No, no, no.

03:26.068 --> 03:29.137
We don't wanna get too close
to this horse, okay?

03:29.238 --> 03:30.705
We have to be quiet
and gentle with Bandit.

03:30.806 --> 03:32.107
He's not like Spartan.

03:32.208 --> 03:33.909
He's not used to people.

03:34.010 --> 03:36.778
Hey! What's the... what's the
deal with this guy, anyway?

03:36.879 --> 03:38.380
I went to make friends
yesterday,

03:38.481 --> 03:40.048
and he tried to bite me!

03:40.149 --> 03:42.784
He has big trust issues
with both people and horses.

03:42.885 --> 03:45.487
And of course, his owner
wants to see results fast.

03:45.588 --> 03:47.188
Do you know Dean Woodley?

03:47.290 --> 03:48.990
Yeah, the-the polo guy, right?

03:49.091 --> 03:51.026
Well, he wants to gift
Bandit to his daughter

03:51.127 --> 03:53.194
for her birthday,
as a trail horse.

03:53.296 --> 03:55.263
And of course,
I'm running out of time.

03:55.364 --> 03:57.499
Well, you know,
I hated to even call you,

03:57.600 --> 03:59.034
but I've got this thing with Ty.

03:59.135 --> 04:00.869
No, Grandpa,
I really appreciate you

04:00.970 --> 04:02.504
- looking after her.
- Anytime.

04:02.605 --> 04:05.640
It's okay, you know, Lyndy and
I, we had fun today, didn't we?

04:05.741 --> 04:07.776
Okay, well, thank you, Grandpa.

Lookin' good, Georgie!

05:23.185 --> 05:24.529
Thanks.

05:25.187 --> 05:27.389
More thanks.

05:32.328 --> 05:33.094
Hi!

05:33.195 --> 05:35.497
Bye bye!

05:36.532 --> 05:38.400
Hi! Bye.

05:40.903 --> 05:43.004
Uh, Lyndy, honey?

05:44.073 --> 05:45.740
No, you-you can't lock the door!

05:45.841 --> 05:47.509
Hey, girls!

05:48.911 --> 05:50.578
Can you let Mommy in?

05:50.680 --> 05:52.180
How's your day going?

05:52.281 --> 05:54.816
Is Lyndy in there?

05:54.917 --> 05:56.818
Yeah.

05:56.919 --> 05:58.186
How? Why?

05:58.287 --> 05:59.954
It's a game we play,
and she loves it,

06:00.056 --> 06:03.058
but she's never actually
locked the door before.

06:03.159 --> 06:05.527
Lyndy, honey?

06:05.628 --> 06:07.262
Daddy's home.

06:07.363 --> 06:09.464
Open the door, sweetheart!

06:09.565 --> 06:10.965
Ah!

06:11.067 --> 06:13.635
Hey, there you are!

06:13.736 --> 06:16.771
Good girl, good girl.

06:16.872 --> 06:18.640
Boy, that Lyndy loves horses.

06:18.741 --> 06:21.443
She just wants to reach out
and touch 'em.

06:21.544 --> 06:23.812
Aw, well, she's her mother's
daughter, isn't she?

06:23.913 --> 06:26.014
Just like Amy was Marion's.

06:26.115 --> 06:29.784
Oh look, our Emerald Lake
reservations got confirmed!

06:29.885 --> 06:31.419
Oh, great!

06:31.520 --> 06:33.121
Isn't that pretty?

06:33.222 --> 06:35.957
A little you and me time,
I am lookin' forward to that.

06:36.058 --> 06:37.225
Oh, you and me both.

06:37.326 --> 06:39.527
It's been a very busy
few months.

06:41.764 --> 06:43.231
This is weird.

06:43.332 --> 06:44.566
What?

06:44.667 --> 06:47.335
Well, Aunt Evelyn's
housekeeper is asking

06:47.436 --> 06:49.170
if I've heard from her,
she usually checks in

06:49.271 --> 06:50.872
every couple of days
when she's traveling,

06:50.973 --> 06:52.474
haven't heard from her
in a week.

06:52.575 --> 06:53.908
She's probably just run off

06:54.009 --> 06:55.910
with some half-baked
billionaire.

06:56.011 --> 06:57.579
What?! I told you,
she has a boyfriend.

06:57.680 --> 07:00.682
- They're travelling together.
- Okay.

07:00.783 --> 07:02.484
Where is she, anyway?

07:02.585 --> 07:03.785
Istanbul, I think.

07:03.886 --> 07:06.527
Oh, well, that's a good
place for her.

07:07.625 --> 07:09.524
Well, I asked Amy to rush home

07:09.625 --> 07:13.166
'cause I'm meeting with Ty,
so where is he?

07:13.788 --> 07:15.363
I don't know.

07:16.365 --> 07:18.266
Yes, I've been working
with Bandit, Dean.

07:18.367 --> 07:20.902
And he's doing a bit better.

07:21.238 --> 07:23.138
Mhmm, yeah.

07:23.239 --> 07:25.340
Yes, mhmm.

07:25.786 --> 07:27.041
Yep.

07:27.143 --> 07:29.010
I know that there
is a deadline, Dean,

07:29.111 --> 07:31.379
and I-I'm working hard
to meet it.

07:32.448 --> 07:34.716
I'll give you a call tomorrow,
and let you know our progress.

07:34.969 --> 07:36.815
Okay, thanks.

07:40.156 --> 07:43.247
Okay, I've gotta go meet
Jack, I'm gonna be late!

07:47.630 --> 07:49.397
I'll help you clean up
when I get back, all right?

07:52.738 --> 07:53.719
Amy?

07:56.672 --> 07:57.972
What's going on?

07:58.073 --> 08:00.441
I'm fine, you just go.

08:04.079 --> 08:06.314
No, tell me, what's going on?

08:08.284 --> 08:10.285
Okay, um...

08:12.321 --> 08:13.721
sometimes I just feel like
I'm not getting done

08:13.823 --> 08:16.391
what I need to get done. I...

08:16.492 --> 08:18.226
I just feel torn.

08:18.327 --> 08:19.794
How so?

08:19.895 --> 08:22.564
Well, with my business,
and looking after Lyndy,

08:22.665 --> 08:24.732
I... it's hard.

08:24.834 --> 08:26.534
I know. I know it is.

08:26.635 --> 08:28.937
- Do you?
- Yeah.

08:29.038 --> 08:31.105
Ty, for you, nothing
has really changed.

08:31.207 --> 08:33.975
You still get up and go to work
at the clinic every day.

08:34.076 --> 08:36.410
Well, of course I go to the
clinic, I mean, that's my job.

08:36.511 --> 08:39.047
I have a job too.
I mean, I've got several.

08:39.148 --> 08:40.582
I'm-I'm trying to be a good mom,

08:40.683 --> 08:42.250
I'm trying to work
with my client horses,

08:42.351 --> 08:43.585
and I'm trying to coach Georgie,

08:43.686 --> 08:46.054
but I know that I'm not
spending enough time with her.

08:46.155 --> 08:47.488
Georgie's doing fine.

08:47.590 --> 08:49.357
She's winning every show
she's entered into.

08:49.458 --> 08:52.160
Yeah, maybe, but if it
wasn't for Grandpa and Lisa,

08:52.261 --> 08:55.630
I wouldn't have time for her,
or anything else.

08:55.731 --> 08:57.332
We rely on them too much, Ty.

08:57.433 --> 08:59.334
And I'm starting to hate
asking them for help.

08:59.435 --> 09:01.936
I feel guilty, and...

09:02.037 --> 09:04.305
I don't know what I'm gonna do
while they're away.

09:04.406 --> 09:06.474
We'll manage, Amy.

09:06.575 --> 09:08.042
Um... I...

09:08.143 --> 09:10.712
Okay, listen, I know we need
to talk about this more, but...

09:10.813 --> 09:12.447
- But you gotta go.
- I gotta go.

09:12.548 --> 09:15.016
- Yeah, I know.
- It's about our land!

09:15.117 --> 09:16.718
Hey, we're meetin'
with the surveyor.

09:16.819 --> 09:18.319
I know, and I'm sorry
for venting.

09:18.420 --> 09:21.122
But if I can't say this to you,
who can I say it to?

09:21.223 --> 09:23.157
And I'm listening. I am!

09:24.593 --> 09:27.395
Ty!

09:32.234 --> 09:34.369
This is not who we are.

09:39.141 --> 09:40.875
We always said we wouldn't be
a traditional family

09:40.976 --> 09:43.044
where the mom stays home,
and the dad goes to work.

09:43.145 --> 09:46.381
But somehow I feel like
that's exactly what's happened.

09:46.482 --> 09:49.417
Amy, I would give anything
to stay at home,

09:49.518 --> 09:52.287
look after Lyndy,
and do my work here.

09:52.388 --> 09:54.289
But I can't.

09:54.390 --> 09:56.324
I know that.

09:56.425 --> 09:57.825
I just was hoping that we could
share this more

09:57.927 --> 09:59.661
- like we said we would.
- We are!

09:59.762 --> 10:02.230
No, we're not, Ty!

10:02.331 --> 10:03.731
Not really.

10:07.670 --> 10:09.871
Hey... hey.

10:10.940 --> 10:12.106
Hey.

10:12.207 --> 10:14.709
Yeah.

10:14.810 --> 10:17.011
I'll be back soon, okay?

10:17.112 --> 10:19.314
Okay, yeah. Come here,
sweetheart.

10:23.819 --> 10:26.254
- Oh! Mommy.
- Yeah.

10:29.091 --> 10:32.093
Oh! Oh! Go, go.

10:32.194 --> 10:34.495
Yeah? Charlie?

10:36.031 --> 10:38.533
No, that's-oh no,
that's good news.

10:38.634 --> 10:41.402
That's good news,
keep that deal alive.

10:41.503 --> 10:44.605
Oh yeah, no,
you can reach me whenever.

10:44.707 --> 10:46.574
Yeah, okay, thank you.

10:46.675 --> 10:49.911
Ha ha! Yes!

10:50.012 --> 10:51.913
What? Good news?

10:52.014 --> 10:53.815
Mitch.

10:54.817 --> 10:59.220
You know, half the stuff
that we have, we don't need.

10:59.321 --> 11:02.183
The important thing
is to know when to...

11:02.691 --> 11:04.158
when to let it go.

11:04.259 --> 11:06.594
Yeah, I know all about that.

11:06.695 --> 11:08.229
What do you mean?

11:08.330 --> 11:10.231
What do you got?
You got a horse.

11:10.332 --> 11:11.799
A-a trailer.

11:11.900 --> 11:13.968
A tin can of a trailer.

11:14.069 --> 11:16.404
Whoa. You-you can't afford
to give away

11:16.505 --> 11:18.106
half the stuff you have,
you're still in a position

11:18.207 --> 11:20.755
where you need to hold on
to what you got.

11:21.677 --> 11:23.845
Believe me,
I know when to fold 'em,

11:23.946 --> 11:26.939
and when to hold 'em better
than any poker player.

11:28.017 --> 11:29.851
Oh, please.

11:29.952 --> 11:32.258
Tell me this isn't about Lou.

12:08.991 --> 12:12.047
Hey, Mom. Where are you?

12:12.861 --> 12:15.129
Oh, nice.
Is your flight on time?

12:17.399 --> 12:19.674
That's good,
I can't wait to see you.

12:21.103 --> 12:23.471
Uh, no, no. Nothing is new.

12:23.572 --> 12:25.139
It's the same old.

12:40.089 --> 12:41.989
Is there somethin' bugging you?

12:45.627 --> 12:48.396
Uh, Amy and I had a, um...

12:48.497 --> 12:50.064
kind of a discussion.

12:50.165 --> 12:52.799
A discussion, huh?

12:54.670 --> 12:57.038
Yeah, she's um, you know,
she's finding it hard

12:57.139 --> 12:59.941
to balance work,
and Lyndy, and, you know.

13:00.042 --> 13:03.811
Well, she's always got
a lot on her plate.

13:03.912 --> 13:05.379
Yeah.

13:05.481 --> 13:07.548
Thanks for helping her
out the way that you do.

13:07.649 --> 13:09.550
- Well, I'm happy to.
- I appreciate it.

13:09.651 --> 13:11.185
No, but, Lisa and I,

13:11.286 --> 13:13.955
you know we're taking
a little road trip here.

13:14.056 --> 13:16.691
Oh yeah, yeah, you guys
deserve it.

13:16.792 --> 13:18.693
It's gonna be fun.

13:18.794 --> 13:21.721
I should talk to Scott,
get some time off.

13:22.264 --> 13:24.065
Oh, speaking of Scott,

13:24.166 --> 13:25.233
he said he was talking
to someone,

13:25.334 --> 13:27.401
and they saw a "for sale" sign
at Big River.

13:27.503 --> 13:29.370
- No way.
- No?

13:29.471 --> 13:31.839
Tim couldn't keep news like
that quiet if you paid him.

13:31.940 --> 13:34.842
He'd be jawing about it
to anyone who'll listen.

13:34.943 --> 13:38.437
Oh. Yeah, you're probably right.

13:39.181 --> 13:40.848
Whoa, Jack! Can you stop
for a second?

13:40.949 --> 13:42.216
What?

13:43.986 --> 13:47.121
Look at that.

13:51.059 --> 13:52.793
It's injured.
Look at all the blood.

13:52.895 --> 13:55.920
Must be wild, way out here.

13:56.832 --> 13:59.667
- Whoa...
- Hey! Over here.

14:03.372 --> 14:07.008
Easy... easy, easy.

14:07.109 --> 14:08.643
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:08.744 --> 14:10.111
There's something on that
bridge.

14:10.212 --> 14:12.013
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:12.114 --> 14:14.315
- I'm gonna go take a look.
- Yeah-yeah.

14:15.551 --> 14:17.018
Whoa.

14:17.119 --> 14:19.153
Stay there. Stay there!

14:21.890 --> 14:23.791
It's a foal, Jack.

14:27.896 --> 14:30.898
Easy now, I'm not
gonna hurt you.

14:30.999 --> 14:32.800
It's all right.

14:33.802 --> 14:35.369
Whoa! Whoa!

14:35.470 --> 14:37.438
Ty! Ty, look out!

14:39.575 --> 14:41.142
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

14:46.815 --> 14:48.916
"Premier Equestrian?"

14:49.017 --> 14:51.252
Wow, "Future Olympians,
The Ones to Watch."

14:51.353 --> 14:53.487
This is pretty exciting.

14:53.589 --> 14:55.523
- When is this happening?
- In a few days.

14:55.624 --> 14:57.124
But I'm not gonna do it.

14:57.226 --> 14:59.594
Why not? It's no wonder
they wanna interview you,

14:59.695 --> 15:02.363
Georgie, I mean, you've been
doing so well this year.

15:02.464 --> 15:04.198
I don't know, it's embarrassing.

15:04.299 --> 15:07.301
It is not.
It's a compliment.

15:07.402 --> 15:10.137
Here you go. Have you told
your Mom yet?

15:10.239 --> 15:11.839
Mmm...

15:11.940 --> 15:14.175
You need to,
she's gonna be so excited.

15:14.276 --> 15:15.710
Would it be bad if I just...

15:15.811 --> 15:17.845
didn't tell her at all?

15:19.514 --> 15:21.215
Okay, I know, you're right.

15:21.316 --> 15:23.084
Hey, Ty.

15:23.185 --> 15:24.719
Hey, Amy?

15:24.820 --> 15:26.687
We've got a bit of an emergency
here with a foal.

15:26.788 --> 15:28.956
- Can you bring my vet kit?
- What? A foal?

15:29.057 --> 15:32.360
W-where are you? What happened?

15:32.461 --> 15:34.362
Okay, no, I will hook up
the trailer,

15:34.463 --> 15:35.763
and I will be right there.

15:37.132 --> 15:39.300
- Easy.
- It's okay.

15:41.336 --> 15:44.038
Hey, are you guys okay?

15:44.139 --> 15:46.574
- Yeah.
- Where's the foal?

15:46.675 --> 15:48.175
It's got its leg stuck
in the bridge.

15:48.277 --> 15:49.977
Can you get it out?

15:50.078 --> 15:52.580
Not unless we can keep
the mom away.

15:52.681 --> 15:54.448
Okay. Easy...

15:56.752 --> 15:59.420
Easy, easy, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:59.521 --> 16:01.222
Go on through, Amy.

16:01.323 --> 16:03.324
- Hey, hey. Thanks.
- Oh.

16:04.459 --> 16:05.693
I have to get to that foal.

16:05.794 --> 16:07.261
Okay, I'll try to keep her here.

16:07.362 --> 16:09.530
Okay.

16:11.900 --> 16:14.568
- You got her?
- Yeah.

16:14.670 --> 16:15.803
- You go.
- Okay.

16:18.373 --> 16:20.274
Hey, easy! Easy!

16:20.375 --> 16:22.176
You're okay.

16:26.733 --> 16:27.867
Whoa.

16:28.936 --> 16:31.871
We're trying to help your baby,
okay?

16:31.972 --> 16:33.873
You're gonna have to trust us.

16:35.976 --> 16:37.990
Easy.

16:39.947 --> 16:41.781
What's goin' on?

16:41.882 --> 16:43.716
Her leg's gone through
the bridge.

16:43.817 --> 16:46.419
Jeez, is it broken?

16:46.520 --> 16:48.321
Well, I can't tell.

16:48.422 --> 16:50.423
Well, what's the plan?

16:50.524 --> 16:52.658
Well, we're gonna have to get
her back to Heartland.

16:52.759 --> 16:53.893
Okay.

16:55.762 --> 16:57.363
- Okay? You all ready?
- Yeah.

16:57.464 --> 16:58.364
Here they come!

17:00.534 --> 17:02.635
Hup! Hup!

17:11.211 --> 17:14.513
- So, we good here?
- Yeah, thanks, Jack.

17:24.023 --> 17:25.958
Yeah, that's a clear image.

17:26.059 --> 17:28.728
- Okay.
- Thanks.

17:28.829 --> 17:30.263
Well, she's pretty dehydrated.

17:30.364 --> 17:32.098
She must've been stuck
on that bridge for a while.

17:32.199 --> 17:33.866
Okay, I'll go get her
some water.

17:33.967 --> 17:35.601
Well, why don't you stay here
with the foal?

17:35.702 --> 17:37.436
- I'll go get the water.
- Okay.

17:37.538 --> 17:39.605
Thanks, and then we need
to treat the mare.

17:39.706 --> 17:40.940
Sounds good.

17:41.942 --> 17:44.110
You're okay.

17:47.414 --> 17:48.881
Come on now, hup!

17:48.982 --> 17:51.584
Block this corner. Hey, hey!

17:52.586 --> 17:55.521
I've gotta try to get
this lead on her.

17:55.622 --> 17:57.456
Easy...

17:57.558 --> 17:58.991
Come on...

18:00.961 --> 18:03.596
Hey, hey.

18:05.399 --> 18:06.832
Easy...

18:08.101 --> 18:10.403
All right.

18:10.504 --> 18:13.072
Easy.

18:13.173 --> 18:15.207
Good.

18:37.798 --> 18:39.465
Thanks for the pain killer.

18:39.566 --> 18:41.100
It's messy, but it's working.

18:41.201 --> 18:44.136
It's one of my mom's recipes.

18:44.237 --> 18:46.472
You're gonna be okay, girl.

18:46.573 --> 18:48.341
Easy... that's it.

18:49.476 --> 18:52.178
We'll get you back to your baby
as soon as we're done here.

19:03.957 --> 19:06.225
Here, just keep the change.

19:08.462 --> 19:10.229
Hi!

19:10.330 --> 19:11.998
How've you been?
I haven't seen you in months!

19:12.099 --> 19:13.566
I'm-I'm good.

19:13.667 --> 19:15.001
I'm really good.

19:15.102 --> 19:16.702
How are you?

19:16.803 --> 19:18.404
Can't complain.

19:18.505 --> 19:19.839
- Why don't we...
- We should probably...

19:21.208 --> 19:22.875
Why don't we get together,
have a coffee or...

19:22.976 --> 19:25.044
- something, sometime?
- Yeah, I'd like that.

19:25.145 --> 19:27.013
Sooner than later.

19:27.114 --> 19:29.682
How's Katie?

19:29.783 --> 19:31.917
She's great, she's all grown up,

19:32.019 --> 19:35.488
She um, flew to Vancouver
to see her dad all on her own.

19:35.589 --> 19:37.523
- Wow, big girl.
- Yeah.

19:37.624 --> 19:39.558
Hey, anyway, I should probably
get to the house, but...

19:39.660 --> 19:42.094
Yeah, do you want me to help
get those bags?

19:42.195 --> 19:44.930
Oh, no, I'm good.

19:45.032 --> 19:47.400
I'll text you.

19:49.202 --> 19:51.704
And Ty just eased that foal's
foot right out of the bridge.

19:51.805 --> 19:52.972
Oh, poor thing.

19:53.073 --> 19:54.407
Luckily, nothing was broken.

19:54.508 --> 19:56.042
Yeah, just some pulled
muscles and tendons,

19:56.143 --> 19:57.443
but she'll bounce back.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.745
You guys are amazing.

19:59.846 --> 20:00.946
That mare was pretty beat up,

20:01.048 --> 20:02.915
do you think she got kicked out
of a herd?

20:03.016 --> 20:04.950
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.

20:05.052 --> 20:06.886
So there's something I want
to run by everyone.

20:06.987 --> 20:08.888
I wasn't gonna mention anything,

20:08.989 --> 20:11.123
but it's about Maggie's
in New York.

20:11.224 --> 20:13.092
Oh, here we go,
it's always something.

20:13.193 --> 20:15.327
That's not true. It's good news.

20:15.429 --> 20:17.430
Speaking of news, did Georgie
tell you about her article?

20:17.531 --> 20:18.998
What article?

20:19.099 --> 20:21.767
I'm sorry,
I thought you told her.

20:22.836 --> 20:26.138
Okay, this magazine wants
to write an article about me.

20:26.239 --> 20:28.607
Yeah, a whole thing
about "future Olympians!"

20:28.709 --> 20:30.009
- Really?
- Wow!

20:30.110 --> 20:31.544
But don't get your hopes up,

20:31.645 --> 20:33.312
because I've decided
I'm not doing it.

20:33.413 --> 20:35.114
- Of course you're doing it.
- No, I'm not!

20:35.215 --> 20:36.549
But why, honey?

20:36.650 --> 20:38.651
I don't wanna put myself
out there like that.

20:38.752 --> 20:41.787
I'd rather stay under the radar.

20:41.888 --> 20:43.355
Speaking of under the radar,

20:43.457 --> 20:44.824
Tim,

20:44.925 --> 20:48.461
someone said there was a
"for sale" sign on Big River.

20:49.463 --> 20:50.896
What?

20:50.997 --> 20:52.965
Hm. Yeah, well,
that someone would be right.

20:53.066 --> 20:56.452
It was for sale, but I sold it.

20:56.670 --> 20:58.471
- Today.
- You sold Big River?

20:58.572 --> 21:00.005
Why didn't you tell us?

21:00.107 --> 21:02.608
- Well, why would I tell you?
- Because you just do.

21:02.709 --> 21:04.143
What if I upped and sold
this place,

21:04.244 --> 21:05.511
you wouldn't have a problem
with that?

21:05.612 --> 21:07.613
Well, you can't compare the two.

21:07.714 --> 21:10.282
Big River hasn't been
in the family for generations.

21:10.383 --> 21:11.650
And what about our cattle?

21:11.752 --> 21:13.052
Well, I leased back
the property.

21:13.153 --> 21:14.720
I just don't need
the ranch house,

21:14.821 --> 21:17.323
I don't need the whole thing.

21:17.424 --> 21:19.692
What?
Don't look at me like that!

21:19.793 --> 21:21.927
I... it's a big house!
I don't need a big house.

21:22.028 --> 21:23.863
I made a list of things
that I need,

21:23.964 --> 21:26.165
things I don't need,
and the ranch, Big River,

21:26.266 --> 21:28.300
was on the list of things
I do not need.

21:28.401 --> 21:31.137
I've got more important things
goin' on in my life.

21:31.238 --> 21:33.539
Okay, maybe, but where
are you gonna live?

21:33.640 --> 21:35.708
Yeah. Good question.

21:35.809 --> 21:37.042
I've got a plan.

21:37.144 --> 21:39.812
A plan. What kind of plan
would that be?

21:39.913 --> 21:42.012
Uh, it's a temporary plan.

21:43.450 --> 21:45.017
And when-when it's more
permanent,

21:45.118 --> 21:47.186
uh, you'll be the first to know.

21:49.422 --> 21:51.056
So...

21:56.797 --> 21:58.430
Dean, hey, how are you?

21:59.499 --> 22:01.433
Wait, tomorrow? No!

22:01.535 --> 22:03.369
Uh, I-I'm not ready.

22:03.470 --> 22:05.037
Well, I haven't even started
to mix Bandit

22:05.138 --> 22:07.039
with the other horses yet.

22:07.140 --> 22:10.953
Because like I said,
I need him to trust me first...

22:11.678 --> 22:13.746
I understand, and...

22:13.847 --> 22:16.682
a-a few days, definitely
before her birthday.

22:16.783 --> 22:18.918
Okay. Thank you.

22:19.019 --> 22:20.753
Bye.

22:20.854 --> 22:23.837
Dean Woodley. Not impressed.

22:24.491 --> 22:26.926
Well, you'll get the job done,

22:27.027 --> 22:29.094
I know you will.

22:29.196 --> 22:31.363
So the foal's hydrated,

22:31.464 --> 22:33.265
they both seem a lot more
comfortable now, actually.

22:37.704 --> 22:40.873
So, your Dad and Big River.
Can you believe that?

22:40.974 --> 22:43.242
No, actually.

22:43.343 --> 22:45.444
I just can't believe that
he didn't tell any of us

22:45.545 --> 22:47.379
that he was selling.

22:47.480 --> 22:50.216
Oh, it doesn't actually
surprise me.

22:50.317 --> 22:52.017
Going through what your Dad did,

22:52.118 --> 22:54.920
It makes you stop,
and reconsider your goals.

22:56.790 --> 22:58.924
Maybe we should reconsider ours.

23:04.030 --> 23:06.532
Is this about what you were...

23:08.201 --> 23:10.569
talking about earlier?

23:10.670 --> 23:12.404
Not really, but...

23:13.673 --> 23:15.741
kinda, I guess.

23:15.842 --> 23:18.287
Just, today.

23:18.612 --> 23:21.747
You know, working
with that mare and foal,

23:21.848 --> 23:25.889
together, I really love that.

23:26.519 --> 23:28.420
Well, so did I.

23:29.556 --> 23:32.091
Maybe that's what I'm missing.

23:32.192 --> 23:35.140
Well, just sharing.

23:37.297 --> 23:41.300
And sharing experiences,
not just with Lyndy,

23:41.401 --> 23:44.436
not just with being parents,
but...

23:44.537 --> 23:46.438
with everything.

23:48.842 --> 23:51.525
I just, I don't wanna lose us.

23:53.580 --> 23:55.881
Well...

24:23.643 --> 24:25.577
Good job, Bandit,
you're a good boy!

24:25.679 --> 24:27.146
Good boy, yeah.

24:27.247 --> 24:28.847
It's okay, it's okay...

24:28.949 --> 24:30.816
You're all right, we're here.

24:32.218 --> 24:34.513
Oh, she's still breathing.

24:38.399 --> 24:40.234
Oh, she's breathing,

24:40.335 --> 24:42.236
but she's in shock.

24:43.671 --> 24:45.305
I heard all the bellowing.
What's going on?

24:45.406 --> 24:46.573
What can I do?

24:46.674 --> 24:48.142
We need to get her in the barn.

24:48.243 --> 24:50.744
It'll be much easier to keep
her warm in there.

24:50.845 --> 24:53.747
Okay, little girl,
let's do this.

24:53.848 --> 24:55.716
- Hey, easy.
- Here we go.

24:55.817 --> 24:57.417
Easy, you can do it.

25:01.489 --> 25:03.423
There you go, good girl.

25:03.525 --> 25:05.959
Good girl! All right, let's go!

25:06.060 --> 25:08.795
It's okay, there you go.
Easy, easy.

25:08.897 --> 25:11.470
Yeah.

25:21.843 --> 25:23.777
You need to do this interview.

25:23.878 --> 25:25.812
It's a big deal.

25:25.914 --> 25:27.181
I don't care!

25:27.282 --> 25:30.083
Well, maybe you don't care,
but what about Amy?

25:30.185 --> 25:31.518
You know, she's been
coaching you so well,

25:31.619 --> 25:34.855
don't you think she deserves
some credit, too?

25:34.956 --> 25:36.290
You don't have to be shy
about it.

25:36.391 --> 25:38.759
This isn't about being shy.

25:38.860 --> 25:40.761
Well, what then?

25:41.896 --> 25:43.297
You don't get it.

25:43.398 --> 25:46.099
Then explain it to me, Georgie.

25:48.102 --> 25:50.137
Okay.

25:50.238 --> 25:52.673
I'm scared.

25:57.278 --> 26:00.458
Does this have to do with
the online bullying?

26:02.584 --> 26:04.451
I don't wanna do anything
that's gonna lead

26:04.552 --> 26:07.454
to negative crap like that
again, I couldn't handle it.

26:07.555 --> 26:09.323
It took months for things
to go back to normal,

26:09.424 --> 26:11.024
you know that.

26:11.125 --> 26:14.630
This is just gonna stir
things up again.

26:15.630 --> 26:18.135
Maybe. Maybe not.

26:18.433 --> 26:21.134
You know, you can't let that
hold you back, Georgie.

26:21.236 --> 26:22.903
Regardless of whether or not
someone else

26:23.004 --> 26:24.938
might be put out by it.

26:26.483 --> 26:29.710
Trust me, I know how hard it is
to make that kind of decision.

26:32.914 --> 26:34.681
When do you have to let
the magazine know by?

26:34.782 --> 26:37.184
Tomorrow.

26:37.615 --> 26:40.621
Okay, I get why
you're hesitating, I do.

26:41.856 --> 26:45.427
And whatever you decide
is good with me, okay?

26:46.661 --> 26:47.823
Night.

26:49.664 --> 26:51.482
Goodnight.

27:05.046 --> 27:06.980
Yeah...

27:11.953 --> 27:13.420
It's still inflamed,

27:13.521 --> 27:15.656
but it's way better
than last night.

27:15.757 --> 27:17.658
Think we can put her back
with her Mamma?

27:26.100 --> 27:27.534
Good, it's okay.

27:27.635 --> 27:29.336
Look at that, you're doing well.

27:32.006 --> 27:34.441
It's okay, there you go.

27:34.542 --> 27:36.009
Good girl.

27:39.047 --> 27:40.580
You got your baby.

27:42.350 --> 27:44.985
Look at Bandit.

27:47.722 --> 27:49.923
He's just staring at them.

27:50.992 --> 27:53.427
You knew she was upset,
didn't you?

27:53.528 --> 27:57.097
It's okay, it's fine now,
she has her baby.

27:57.198 --> 27:59.666
You're a good boy, yes, you are.

28:00.702 --> 28:03.270
Yeah! Do you wanna come say hi?

28:07.342 --> 28:10.277
It's okay, Bandit's not
gonna hurt you.

28:16.084 --> 28:17.684
Oh!

28:17.785 --> 28:20.354
Wow, I've never seen Bandit
take any interest

28:20.455 --> 28:22.823
in another horse before.

28:22.924 --> 28:25.158
Look at that.

28:27.962 --> 28:30.864
A step in the right direction.

28:33.234 --> 28:34.468
I better head to the clinic.

28:34.569 --> 28:36.670
Wait, you haven't even
slept yet.

28:36.771 --> 28:39.005
I know, but I'm on the early
shift, so...

28:44.846 --> 28:46.847
Here's Mommy and Daddy!

28:46.948 --> 28:49.282
Good morning, Pumpkin!

28:49.384 --> 28:50.384
Hey!

28:50.485 --> 28:52.519
Thanks, Georgie.

28:52.620 --> 28:54.488
Hey! Hey!

28:54.589 --> 28:56.189
- Down.
- Down?

28:56.290 --> 28:57.758
Okay, if you have any trouble
with the foal,

28:57.859 --> 29:00.627
- give me a call, all right?
- Okay.

29:00.728 --> 29:03.663
You know, I didn't mean
to be so down.

29:03.765 --> 29:06.199
I really wouldn't change
anything.

29:06.300 --> 29:08.881
Except maybe having you
around more.

29:11.339 --> 29:14.060
I think you made that
loud and clear.

29:16.844 --> 29:18.545
Bye, Daddy.

30:00.321 --> 30:02.689
What're you doing here?
Did you follow me in here?

30:02.790 --> 30:04.925
How could I follow in here?
I was here first.

30:05.026 --> 30:06.927
What're you doing here?

30:08.329 --> 30:09.930
Lou! Oh.

30:11.132 --> 30:13.266
- Hi.
- Oh...

30:13.367 --> 30:15.735
- Thanks. Hi.
- Hi.

30:15.837 --> 30:18.038
What... what was Mitch
doing here?

30:18.139 --> 30:19.973
What? I don't have a clue.

30:20.074 --> 30:22.509
Well, more to the point,
what are you doing here?

30:24.245 --> 30:25.479
Oh...

30:26.747 --> 30:29.613
Oh my gosh! Are you kidding me?!

30:31.886 --> 30:33.954
Is this what you meant
last night,

30:34.055 --> 30:36.256
about realizing what's really
important in life?

30:36.357 --> 30:38.551
What? No! Yeah. What?

30:38.726 --> 30:42.184
Are-are you looking
at engagement rings?

30:42.830 --> 30:45.165
Are you? You are!

30:45.266 --> 30:46.800
I knew it! Oh my gosh!

30:46.901 --> 30:48.301
Of course that's what
you're doing!

30:48.402 --> 30:49.703
It makes so much sense!

30:50.738 --> 30:52.539
I'm right, aren't I? I'm always
right about this stuff.

30:52.640 --> 30:54.407
All right, stop talking!

30:55.877 --> 30:58.278
I'm gonna... propose to Casey.

30:59.447 --> 31:02.082
I'm-I'm gonna ask her
to marry me.

31:02.183 --> 31:03.850
Dad!

31:06.220 --> 31:07.921
Oh my God!

31:12.429 --> 31:14.259
Is Casey gonna come back
from the rodeo circuit

31:14.369 --> 31:16.236
and then you guys move
into her place?

31:16.337 --> 31:18.438
Or... oh! You guys are gonna buy
a place together!

31:18.540 --> 31:20.307
Lou, stop it, please,
I never should've told you.

31:20.408 --> 31:22.242
- You can't tell anyone!
- Can I get some help, please?

31:22.343 --> 31:24.678
No one! I don't even know why
I told you in the first place,

31:24.779 --> 31:27.147
you can't keep a secret
if your life depended on it.

31:27.248 --> 31:29.149
Dad! I swear I will not
tell a soul.

31:29.250 --> 31:31.652
Can we just see this whole
tray, please?

31:31.753 --> 31:33.320
I'm just excited, you know?

31:33.421 --> 31:35.622
And... but why was Mitch helping
you choose?

31:35.723 --> 31:37.624
Why would I need Mitch's help?

31:37.725 --> 31:39.459
Thank you. Well then,
why was he here?

31:39.561 --> 31:42.095
And why did he run away
from me like that?

31:42.197 --> 31:44.398
Why was he looking at jewelry?

31:45.600 --> 31:48.502
No! No-no-no. No.
It can't be that.

31:48.603 --> 31:50.037
I mean, that's crazy.

31:50.138 --> 31:52.172
For a minute there, I thought...
but no, that's ridiculous.

31:52.273 --> 31:55.042
I mean, we've been keeping
in touch, and texting, but...

31:55.143 --> 31:56.777
Oh, don't go there, Lou.

31:56.878 --> 31:58.645
But Dad, he said he wants
to see me.

31:58.746 --> 32:01.148
Sooner rather than later, and I
haven't even phoned him yet.

32:01.249 --> 32:02.716
I guess I should.

32:02.817 --> 32:04.151
But no, that's ridiculous,
right?

32:04.252 --> 32:05.519
Yeah, this is ridiculous.

32:05.620 --> 32:06.987
Okay, but the point is,

32:07.088 --> 32:09.456
you are not buying this ring
for Casey without my input.

32:09.557 --> 32:10.791
So we'll look at these,

32:10.892 --> 32:12.726
and then we'll go for a nice,
celebratory lunch.

32:12.827 --> 32:13.927
I have something really
important

32:14.028 --> 32:15.495
I wanna talk to you about.

32:15.597 --> 32:17.164
But what could be more important

32:17.265 --> 32:19.132
than this teardrop-shaped ring?
It is gorgeous, I'm thinking...

32:23.438 --> 32:25.939
A little jumpy?

32:26.040 --> 32:27.808
You okay?

32:27.909 --> 32:29.743
Okay, so I've decided
to do this interview,

32:29.844 --> 32:32.145
and it's probably the most
stupid decision I've ever made,

32:32.247 --> 32:33.747
and it's all your fault!

32:33.848 --> 32:36.149
Oh, it's my fault, is it?

32:36.251 --> 32:38.151
Yeah, you and Mom.

32:38.253 --> 32:40.320
She guilted me into doing this
because she says

32:40.421 --> 32:42.022
you're my coach
and you deserve the credit,

32:42.123 --> 32:44.358
which is true, you do, but...

32:44.459 --> 32:45.692
now I'm doing it!

32:45.793 --> 32:47.995
Georgie, don't do this
for me, okay?

32:48.096 --> 32:50.197
I don't need the credit.
Do it for you.

32:50.298 --> 32:52.966
Absolutely, honey. When is it?

32:53.067 --> 32:55.202
This afternoon. The writer's
coming with a photographer.

32:55.303 --> 32:57.704
- Good.
- You're gonna be there, right?

32:57.805 --> 32:59.640
They're gonna wanna talk to you.

32:59.741 --> 33:01.041
I will try, okay?

33:01.142 --> 33:02.976
But I have so much to do today.

33:03.077 --> 33:04.378
I've got Bandit's owner
breathing down my neck.

33:04.479 --> 33:05.979
I have to watch out
for that foal,

33:06.080 --> 33:07.881
and I have to find a way
to calm down the mare.

33:07.982 --> 33:09.383
Well, don't forget that
Lyndy and I

33:09.484 --> 33:11.218
are spending the entire day
together.

33:11.319 --> 33:13.453
- I appreciate that.
- Yeah.

33:13.554 --> 33:16.456
Hey, this interview
is about you.

33:16.557 --> 33:18.892
Not your coach.
You're gonna be great.

33:22.630 --> 33:24.798
Okay, okay.

33:24.899 --> 33:27.801
All right, all right.

33:29.871 --> 33:31.238
Okay...

33:39.881 --> 33:42.683
Hi Mrs. Wagner,
it's Dr. Borden calling.

33:42.784 --> 33:44.584
Yeah, Sushi's fine,
he's right here.

33:44.686 --> 33:46.086
I updated him up on all
his vaccinations,

33:46.187 --> 33:48.588
so you won't have to make
another trip in.

33:48.690 --> 33:52.059
Yeah, you can pick him up
first thing in the morning.

33:52.160 --> 33:54.394
All right, I'll see you then.

34:06.607 --> 34:08.275
It's perfect.

34:08.376 --> 34:10.744
I mean, look how it catches
the light.

34:10.844 --> 34:12.579
She's gonna love it.

34:12.679 --> 34:16.083
So, how are you gonna propose?
And where?

34:16.184 --> 34:18.284
- You should probably do it soon.
- Lou, that's it!

34:18.386 --> 34:20.187
- Please, stop.
- What?

34:20.288 --> 34:22.089
I've already told you enough,
okay?

34:22.190 --> 34:23.956
And I'm starting to regret it.

34:24.058 --> 34:25.958
Now you asked me to come here
'cause you had something

34:26.060 --> 34:27.793
you wanted to discuss,
what is it?

34:27.895 --> 34:30.330
Okay. I have a bit of a dilemma.

34:30.431 --> 34:33.333
- You know Nicole, my partner?
- Yeah, I know who Nicole is.

34:33.434 --> 34:35.936
So you know this past year
hasn't exactly been easy,

34:36.036 --> 34:37.603
and she's seen how torn
I've been,

34:37.705 --> 34:41.308
running back and forth, trying
to be all things to everyone.

34:41.409 --> 34:43.643
So, Nicole has offered
to buy me out

34:43.745 --> 34:46.813
of the Maggie's franchise
in New York.

34:46.914 --> 34:49.116
- Buy you out?
- Yes.

34:49.217 --> 34:50.784
How would that work?

34:50.885 --> 34:53.085
- Cash settlement?
- Exactly.

34:53.187 --> 34:55.288
And I would still be considered
an investor,

34:55.389 --> 34:57.357
so I would get a percentage
of all future profits.

34:57.458 --> 34:59.893
I mean, she's making me
a very generous offer.

34:59.994 --> 35:02.295
It would a bit of a windfall,

35:02.397 --> 35:05.665
but to walk away from a project
I've worked so hard on,

35:05.767 --> 35:08.201
and sacrificed so much for,
I just...

35:09.370 --> 35:10.704
I need your advice.

35:10.805 --> 35:12.172
And I know you're probably
gonna tell me

35:12.273 --> 35:14.374
- to just stick with it.
- No, take it.

35:14.475 --> 35:16.877
Let her take over.
Let her take control.

35:16.978 --> 35:19.813
We know how hard you've worked,
and what you've sacrificed.

35:20.761 --> 35:22.039
Give yourself a bonus.

35:22.583 --> 35:25.131
- Really?
- Yeah.

35:25.453 --> 35:27.254
Step back, take the deal.

35:27.355 --> 35:31.024
Now, a year ago I might've had
a different opinion, but...

35:31.125 --> 35:33.760
- I know, but still...
- And think of the upside.

35:33.861 --> 35:36.029
Huh? The money? Both of us,
me selling Big River,

35:36.130 --> 35:38.031
you selling your share
in Maggie's in New York City,

35:38.132 --> 35:40.300
- whew!
- It's tempting.

35:40.401 --> 35:43.336
I mean, just stepping back
into my life,

35:43.438 --> 35:45.338
being with my daughters
day to day,

35:45.440 --> 35:48.375
you know, just getting back
to normal.

35:48.476 --> 35:50.410
And maybe getting back
to normal with somebody else,

35:50.511 --> 35:53.013
considering I saw them shopping
for rings...

35:53.114 --> 35:54.448
and jewellery.

35:56.384 --> 35:58.218
Hey, I'm kidding,
I'm just kidding.

36:00.154 --> 36:03.423
Oh good, Georgie's gonna do
that interview.

36:03.524 --> 36:04.925
Okay, I've gotta go.

36:05.026 --> 36:06.726
But thank you for the advice.

36:06.828 --> 36:08.929
Keep me in the proposal loop,

36:09.030 --> 36:10.997
because this is very exciting.

36:12.099 --> 36:13.867
- Lou.
- Oh!

36:15.670 --> 36:18.038
There you go. Bye!

36:34.956 --> 36:36.323
Hey.

36:37.525 --> 36:39.626
You're home early,
is everything all right?

36:41.762 --> 36:44.331
You wanna take a walk?

36:44.432 --> 36:46.933
So I've been wrapping my head
around what you said.

36:47.034 --> 36:48.435
How I walk out the door,
go off to work,

36:48.536 --> 36:50.937
and I leave all my parental
responsibilities to you.

36:51.038 --> 36:53.139
Ty, that's not what I meant.

36:53.241 --> 36:55.342
You were right though, Amy.

36:55.443 --> 36:57.143
And that's gotta change.

36:57.245 --> 36:59.446
I feel pulled
in all directions, too.

36:59.547 --> 37:01.681
- Ty...
- Just hear me out, okay?

37:01.782 --> 37:03.450
'Cause I got an idea.

37:04.685 --> 37:06.887
The last two years,
I've loved my work.

37:06.988 --> 37:09.956
Traveling, helping causes
that are important to me,

37:10.057 --> 37:11.791
causes that make a difference.

37:11.893 --> 37:14.528
I gained a lot from it,
I really have.

37:16.030 --> 37:17.797
But there was a price.

37:18.866 --> 37:21.368
I miss spending time with you.

37:21.469 --> 37:24.104
And with Lyndy.

37:24.205 --> 37:26.673
And now, my work at the clinic,
it's...

37:26.774 --> 37:28.909
it's just standard stuff,
I mean, I'm inoculating cats,

37:29.010 --> 37:31.011
and dogs, and maybe
the odd surgery.

37:31.112 --> 37:32.712
And that's great.

37:32.813 --> 37:34.281
I just don't feel like
I'm contributing

37:34.382 --> 37:36.650
the same way anymore.

37:36.751 --> 37:38.585
But yesterday,

37:38.686 --> 37:40.153
when you and I were working
with that foal,

37:40.254 --> 37:41.621
bringing her back to health...

37:41.722 --> 37:43.390
Yeah.

37:43.491 --> 37:46.293
I realized I can make
a difference right here,

37:46.394 --> 37:48.261
on my own doorstep.

37:49.463 --> 37:51.398
Do you remember that dream
that we had when I graduated

37:51.499 --> 37:53.567
from vet school?

37:54.769 --> 37:56.736
Why don't we make that
a reality?

37:56.837 --> 37:58.505
What do you mean?

37:59.640 --> 38:01.041
I talked to Scott.

38:01.142 --> 38:02.842
I asked if I could
cut my hours back,

38:02.944 --> 38:04.411
so I could spend more time
working with you,

38:04.512 --> 38:07.280
and helping out with Lyndy,
and he agreed.

38:07.381 --> 38:09.149
But Ty, you're gonna take
a huge pay cut.

38:09.250 --> 38:11.318
- This...
- No, I'm not.

38:12.520 --> 38:15.689
Because you and I are going
to build a business.

38:15.790 --> 38:18.058
I want us to be partners!
I want us to work together.

38:18.159 --> 38:20.026
Like we dreamed about.

38:20.127 --> 38:22.662
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

38:23.728 --> 38:25.865
This is exactly what I want.

38:27.851 --> 38:29.903
We're in this together, okay?

38:30.004 --> 38:32.005
Yeah, okay.

38:43.520 --> 38:45.661
So Georgie tell me a little
about your horse.

38:45.785 --> 38:47.417
I mean, I understand
Phoenix here

38:47.518 --> 38:49.318
came in as a bit of an underdog.

38:49.420 --> 38:51.621
- He sure showed everybody.
- Yeah, he did.

38:53.490 --> 38:55.258
Phoenix is amazing.

38:55.359 --> 38:57.794
We both got here around
the same time.

38:57.895 --> 39:00.396
I guess you could say
we were both strays.

39:26.790 --> 39:28.991
Who would you say
is your biggest supporter?

39:29.093 --> 39:30.927
Your role model?

39:31.028 --> 39:34.030
I could never choose
just one person.

39:34.131 --> 39:36.132
My adopted family is filled
with a long line

39:36.233 --> 39:38.334
of strong, independent women.

39:40.537 --> 39:43.339
My grandmother, Marion,
was a renowned horsewoman,

39:44.775 --> 39:48.578
just like my Aunt Amy,
who is also my coach.

39:49.713 --> 39:51.848
I couldn't have achieved
anything without Amy.

39:51.949 --> 39:54.851
She helped me through
the good times and the bad.

39:54.952 --> 39:57.053
All these women are my mentors.

39:57.154 --> 39:59.655
And I know I have very big
shoes to fill.

40:01.492 --> 40:02.859
And then there's
my Mom, Lou.

40:02.960 --> 40:04.827
She's amazing.

40:04.928 --> 40:05.995
She never gives up.

40:06.096 --> 40:08.131
Hey.

40:08.232 --> 40:10.199
Hey!

40:10.300 --> 40:12.201
Thanks for coming out here.

40:12.302 --> 40:14.470
I'm glad we could meet up.

40:14.886 --> 40:16.372
Me too.

40:17.421 --> 40:19.976
Well, are you happy to be back?

40:20.077 --> 40:22.078
Even if it is just
for a short visit?

40:22.179 --> 40:24.747
Actually, I'm in a position
right now

40:24.848 --> 40:27.543
to decide whether
to take a step back.

40:28.326 --> 40:30.553
Right yeah,
I've heard that before.

40:30.654 --> 40:32.321
No. Really.

40:32.422 --> 40:34.757
Okay, I'll believe you
this time.

40:36.393 --> 40:39.395
Actually Lou, I'm-I'm glad
that we were able to...

40:39.496 --> 40:43.633
stay in touch,
even if it was just over text.

40:43.734 --> 40:45.201
Me too.

40:45.302 --> 40:47.403
I love that we can just reach
out to each other,

40:47.504 --> 40:49.539
no matter where we are, and...

40:50.179 --> 40:52.158
stay in touch.

40:52.543 --> 40:54.510
You know, but I think
there are some things

40:54.611 --> 40:56.879
that you can't say over text.

40:56.980 --> 40:58.781
That you have to say in person.

40:58.882 --> 41:00.383
I agree.

41:00.484 --> 41:03.319
And that's why I'm glad
you came up here.

41:03.420 --> 41:05.555
Because...

41:07.124 --> 41:09.225
well, because I wanted
to tell you...

41:11.128 --> 41:12.929
I'm dating again.

41:13.030 --> 41:15.331
I'm seeing people.

41:15.432 --> 41:17.900
A-a person,
I'm-I'm seeing a person.

41:18.001 --> 41:20.269
I'm dating someone.

41:20.370 --> 41:22.438
Oh. Oh!

41:24.541 --> 41:26.909
Wow, that's...

41:27.010 --> 41:29.879
- that's amazing.
- Really?

41:29.980 --> 41:31.814
Yeah, no, I'm so happy for you.

41:31.915 --> 41:34.457
This is such a relief
to hear you say that.

41:37.321 --> 41:38.588
I'm especially proud
of my Mom,

41:38.689 --> 41:40.423
because she is so strong
and centered,

41:40.524 --> 41:43.025
and she knows exactly
what she wants.

41:47.164 --> 41:49.699
Casey? Hi, honey,
I got you on speakerphone,

41:49.800 --> 41:51.467
I hope you can hear me.

41:51.568 --> 41:54.637
Um, if traffic's good,
I'm gonna be down in Kalispell

41:54.738 --> 41:57.273
in about three hours, okay?
So I'll see you then.

41:57.374 --> 41:58.841
Love you!

42:14.524 --> 42:16.282
Hello?

42:16.960 --> 42:18.561
Hello?

42:19.563 --> 42:21.998
Aunt Evelyn, is... hi!

42:22.099 --> 42:24.734
Oh my, I'm-I'm so glad
to hear from you!

42:24.835 --> 42:26.969
I've been worried!
What's going on?

42:29.039 --> 42:30.873
Oh no, oh dear.

42:30.974 --> 42:34.176
I'm so sorry to hear that.
Well, can I...

42:34.278 --> 42:36.153
Oh, you... join you?

42:36.463 --> 42:40.316
I don't-I don't know if I can...
I can pull that off.

42:41.518 --> 42:43.619
No, of course I wanna come
see you.

42:43.720 --> 42:46.222
I-I... can you, I'm just,
I'm gonna...

42:46.323 --> 42:48.824
let me check my commitments,
and then get back to you,

42:48.926 --> 42:50.459
is that all right?

42:50.560 --> 42:53.195
Okay, I'll... I-yes, I promise.

42:53.297 --> 42:54.897
I promise. Okay, I love you.

42:54.998 --> 42:56.699
You take care.

42:56.800 --> 42:59.035
All right bye, bye.

43:01.004 --> 43:02.038
Oh boy.

43:16.486 --> 43:19.121
Huh? What's Daddy doing?
