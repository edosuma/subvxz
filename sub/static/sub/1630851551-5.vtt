01:05.680 --> 01:07.960
Hi. You from the police?

01:07.960 --> 01:09.520
Yeah, no. Sort of.

01:09.520 --> 01:11.840
Mm, your mates left
about two hours ago.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.920
Oh, yeah, I always come
after them. I've...

01:13.920 --> 01:16.120
Oh, my God. What?

01:16.120 --> 01:18.200
Where did you get that T-shirt?
It's so cool.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.720
I don't know,
I've had it years.

01:19.720 --> 01:21.960
Mm. I thought it might be
from the vintage place in town.

01:21.960 --> 01:23.120
It looks proper '80s.

01:23.120 --> 01:24.520
Probably is proper '80s.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.040
I probably bought it
in the proper '80s.

01:26.040 --> 01:27.960
Shut up! You shut up.

01:27.960 --> 01:29.600
Come on, I'll show you
what happened.

01:29.600 --> 01:30.720
Hey.

01:30.720 --> 01:33.160
Your parents have got good taste.

01:33.160 --> 01:34.280
That's MY car.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.480
I know you'll never be mine,

01:44.480 --> 01:46.640
but no-one could love you

01:46.640 --> 01:48.720
the way I would've loved you.

01:48.720 --> 01:49.880
What are you doing?

01:49.880 --> 01:52.240
Oh, no, I was just, uh...

01:52.240 --> 01:54.480
No, she's good, mate.
Yeah, good as gold, that is.

01:54.480 --> 01:56.000
Yep.

01:58.840 --> 02:00.400
In here.

02:20.160 --> 02:22.760
Well, you've stolen my childhood.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.720
Oh, I'm totally obsessed
with '80s stuff,

02:25.720 --> 02:27.760
literally anything
made in the '80s.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.240
Have you seen Stranger Things?

02:29.240 --> 02:30.640
That wasn't made in the '80s.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.320
But you like '80s, too.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.160
Yeah, I'm FROM the '80s.

02:35.160 --> 02:36.600
Amazing.

02:36.600 --> 02:37.680
Like Back To The Future?

02:37.680 --> 02:38.920
Yes.

02:38.920 --> 02:43.120
"Roads? Where we're going,
we don't need roads."

02:44.880 --> 02:46.720
You haven't seen it, have you?

02:46.720 --> 02:48.160
No. No.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.160
Mm. I've got to update me socials.

02:50.160 --> 02:53.280
You're cool to do your thing,
put tape up or whatever.

02:53.280 --> 02:54.640
Yeah, cool, whatever.

02:54.640 --> 02:57.040
Vibe. What?

02:57.040 --> 02:58.240
I don't know.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.000
It just felt right to say "vibe".

03:00.000 --> 03:01.640
Why?

03:02.680 --> 03:04.080
What happened with, uh...?

03:04.080 --> 03:07.240
Oh, man, this dude came round
to wire in the arcade machine

03:07.240 --> 03:08.520
and...bam!

03:08.520 --> 03:10.160
Bam? Bam.

03:10.160 --> 03:11.840
What's bam? It just went up.

03:11.840 --> 03:13.520
What's a fuse?

03:13.520 --> 03:15.160
They stop people going bam.

03:15.160 --> 03:18.240
Thank God I was out.
Blood, it makes me barf.

03:18.240 --> 03:19.400
Hmm.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.480
Poor guy, though, eh?

03:22.480 --> 03:24.800
Ugh, I know. It was, like, so sad.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.840
Yeah. I can see you're devastated.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.960
Hi, guys!

03:27.960 --> 03:29.520
So, today, I'm going to do
a vintage haul.

03:29.520 --> 03:31.320
I've been saving up
loads of amazing stuff.

03:31.320 --> 03:32.800
Some of it's just old,
but this is actual...

03:32.800 --> 03:35.800
I'm going to get my stuff.
Oh, oh, wait.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.320
Before you go,

03:37.320 --> 03:39.480
are you cool if I check
something with you?

03:42.160 --> 03:44.080
Is that a tray of onions?

03:50.240 --> 03:52.440
Mm.

04:01.760 --> 04:02.920
I'm in shock.

04:02.920 --> 04:05.080
Something terrible
has happened and...

04:06.200 --> 04:08.400
..I don't know what to say.

04:08.400 --> 04:09.840
Sorry, I need a moment.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.400
I know this is going to worry
a few of you, and...

04:14.480 --> 04:16.000
..I'm fine.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.120
Yeah.

04:18.280 --> 04:20.200
No, I'm not.

04:20.200 --> 04:22.440
I can't do this now,
but I'll be back in 30 minutes

04:22.440 --> 04:24.040
to tell you
how my life has changed...

04:26.000 --> 04:27.560
..forever.

04:33.320 --> 04:34.480
Well?

04:34.480 --> 04:36.400
Jesus Christ.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.880
Did it make you want
to like and subscribe?

04:37.880 --> 04:38.960
Liken subscribe?

04:38.960 --> 04:40.120
Like and subscribe.

04:40.120 --> 04:42.200
I don't know. Please say yeah.

04:42.200 --> 04:43.760
I can't.
I don't know what it means.

04:43.760 --> 04:45.960
Well, say you'll like and subscribe.

04:45.960 --> 04:47.880
I can't say like and subscribe
to something

04:47.880 --> 04:49.040
that I don't understand.

04:49.040 --> 04:51.080
I don't know what like
and subscribe is. Just say it!

04:51.080 --> 04:53.560
One button, that's all it is.
Just say it. Just say it, please.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.640
Hosea, me, you... But what is it?
..like, subscribe.

04:55.640 --> 04:57.920
How can I if I don't understand it?
I need you on my side.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.840
How can I agree to it? I just want
you to like and subscribe!

05:00.840 --> 05:02.880
One button. One button.
Please like and subscribe.

05:02.880 --> 05:04.480
Like and subscribe!

05:08.800 --> 05:10.000
Thanks so much.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.200
I can't do this now,
but I'll be back in 30 minutes

05:25.200 --> 05:26.840
to tell you how
my life has changed...

05:26.840 --> 05:27.880
..forever.

05:27.880 --> 05:29.400
Did you buy all this stuff, then?

05:29.400 --> 05:31.560
Oh, most of it got sent to me.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.680
Can I play with some of it?

05:33.680 --> 05:35.240
Sure.

05:38.240 --> 05:39.440
I used to be able to do these.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.640
What do you mean?

05:40.640 --> 05:42.120
You know, do them, complete them.

05:42.120 --> 05:43.880
I didn't know you could do them.

05:43.880 --> 05:46.360
I thought you just switched the
stickers. I can complete them.

05:46.360 --> 05:47.960
Are you like Professor Brian Cox?

05:49.320 --> 05:51.760
I'm exactly like
Professor Brian Cox.

06:10.240 --> 06:11.320
Ta-da!

06:11.320 --> 06:13.800
Fuck off! You fuck off.

06:13.800 --> 06:15.240
This is going to break
the internet.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.440
I'll DM it you.

06:16.440 --> 06:18.000
I think there's probably
already videos

06:18.000 --> 06:19.960
of people doing
a Rubik's cube online, mate.

06:19.960 --> 06:21.080
You should upload it.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.720
I mean, I can't, because
of the big announcement.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.120
What socials are you on?

06:24.120 --> 06:26.400
Oh. I'm only on Facebook.
I don't use that.

06:26.400 --> 06:28.400
I keep getting death threats
from this woman.

06:28.400 --> 06:30.640
You should look her up, actually.
It's funny -

06:30.640 --> 06:32.040
the Tattooed Milf.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.160
You should get on Insta and TikTok.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.800
My niece is always
banging on about that.

06:35.800 --> 06:36.840
What is TikTok?

06:36.840 --> 06:38.000
What's TikTok?

06:45.320 --> 06:47.920
That's TikTok.
Well, I do not like it.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.280
I'm not uploading that.

06:51.280 --> 06:53.520
I don't like any
of this social media stuff.

06:53.520 --> 06:55.200
Who wants to know
how people are doing?

06:55.200 --> 06:57.320
Chris Marner's
got an Audi R8 now.

06:57.320 --> 06:58.600
At school, he got suspended

06:58.600 --> 07:00.400
for eating the hood
off a girl's coat.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.480
You wouldn't have to do any of
this police business any more

07:02.480 --> 07:03.680
if you got enough followers.

07:03.680 --> 07:06.280
I'm sorry, what is your job?

07:06.280 --> 07:07.960
I'm Home Alone Hosea!

07:12.400 --> 07:13.720
Jesus Christ, Grandad.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.080
Do you own a computer?

07:15.080 --> 07:17.040
Yeah. My mate Weasel
got it for me, though,

07:17.040 --> 07:18.400
and the keyboard's confusing.

07:18.400 --> 07:21.360
Well, look me up sometime. I will.

07:21.360 --> 07:23.200
Do you know your name
in Chinese symbols?

07:23.200 --> 07:25.240
Catch you later.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.880
Loving the sexy police onesie,
by the way.

07:32.240 --> 07:35.360

What have you done?

08:59.840 --> 09:01.200
I'm sorry, I was thirsty.

09:01.200 --> 09:02.400
You drank that?

09:02.400 --> 09:04.680
Those cans are 35 years old.
I got them on eBay!

09:04.680 --> 09:06.760
Never mind that.
You've cleaned up all the blood.

09:06.760 --> 09:09.080
Yeah, it's my job.
You said you were the police.

09:09.080 --> 09:10.600
No, YOU said I was the police.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.000
Well, what are you?
A crime scene cleaner.

09:13.000 --> 09:14.640
You're a cleaner?! Crime scene.

09:14.640 --> 09:16.200
He's just a cleaner! Who are you?

09:16.200 --> 09:18.320
Why didn't you say
you were just some cleaner?

09:18.320 --> 09:19.720
Cos I'm not. Says he's not.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.720
Well, he is. I'm not. What?!

09:21.720 --> 09:22.760
What are you, dude?

09:22.760 --> 09:24.120
I'm a crime scene cleaner!

09:24.120 --> 09:25.560
If you clean, you're a cleaner.

09:25.560 --> 09:27.920
And you've basically ruined
my life! Well done, cleaner.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.520
Not cool, bro.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.040
Cool T-shirt, though.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.680
What did I do wrong?

09:47.680 --> 09:49.440
You cleaned his content, man.

09:49.440 --> 09:51.840
What? He needed that content.

09:51.840 --> 09:53.400
Why do you keep saying content?

09:53.400 --> 09:55.240
He was going to livestream
about the dead guy.

09:55.240 --> 09:56.840
Content's money, bro.

09:56.840 --> 09:59.160
OK, I'm not going to talk
to you any more.

09:59.160 --> 10:00.800
There's clearly something wrong.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.480
Yo! Stay where you are.

10:04.480 --> 10:05.720
Yeah, we can't light it.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.640
Some massive fat dude
cleared it up.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.400
OK, I'll come there now.

10:10.640 --> 10:11.720
Fat?

10:12.760 --> 10:14.160
Yeah, you're, like, really fat.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.120
Mate?

10:24.600 --> 10:26.040
Oi, mate!

10:29.280 --> 10:30.840
Can you come down?

10:30.840 --> 10:33.320
Are you going to make me
climb up there?

10:34.720 --> 10:36.160
You think I haven't got
those skills?

10:36.160 --> 10:39.400
You think I haven't got
tree-climbing skills?

10:39.400 --> 10:41.640
All right, strap in.

10:43.480 --> 10:45.960
Yes, please!

10:45.960 --> 10:47.680
Not a problem.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.880
There he is.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.800
Up we go.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.240
Yeah.

10:55.680 --> 10:57.520
All good. All good.

11:00.200 --> 11:03.080
Still got it. You never lose it.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.520
Whoo!

11:04.520 --> 11:06.560
This used to be like
Disney World for us.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.960
Cos you were poor? Boo-hoo.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.680
Look, I don't know
what I've done wrong.

11:11.680 --> 11:14.080
I was going to do a big stream
about the guy getting fried,

11:14.080 --> 11:15.920
and now it's like
it never happened.

11:15.920 --> 11:18.720
People aren't interested in an
electrical accident, are they?

11:18.720 --> 11:21.480
I would've filmed Fat Baz down
the pub when he blew his thumb off.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.720
Why?

11:22.720 --> 11:25.320
Oh, he was trying to hook
a crumpet out of a toaster.

11:25.320 --> 11:26.400
It was... No!

11:26.400 --> 11:27.960
Why are you still talking to me?

11:27.960 --> 11:30.160
I needed that dead guy,
and you've cleaned him up.

11:30.160 --> 11:31.840
Can't you put it back?

11:31.840 --> 11:33.240
Put what back?

11:33.240 --> 11:34.280
The blood.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.800
Oh, the blood. Yeah, God, of course.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.160
I've got some buckets in the car.

11:38.160 --> 11:39.600
We'll go and splash it back on now.

11:39.600 --> 11:40.800
You're shitting me?

11:40.800 --> 11:42.120
Yes, I'm shitting you.

11:42.120 --> 11:45.000
Well, congratulations
for finding my ruined life

11:45.000 --> 11:47.600
so hilarious, you sad, old fuck.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.520
Go and mop up somewhere else.
Well...

11:50.520 --> 11:52.200
I don't even use a mop.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.480
Your move.

11:54.520 --> 11:56.000
Look, what's the matter, son?

11:56.000 --> 11:58.880
It's over.

11:58.880 --> 12:00.280
I know that, really.

12:00.280 --> 12:03.320
Home Alone Hosea is just
another Tom from MySpace

12:03.320 --> 12:05.520
or the guy that sang
Chocolate Rain.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.080
Or that monkey
that banged that frog.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.040
So you've heard of the monkey
that banged a frog?

12:09.040 --> 12:10.520
The monkey's a legend, mate.

12:12.040 --> 12:13.800
That's me now.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.120
The monkey that banged a frog.

12:17.640 --> 12:18.920
A joke.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.400
Blackberry jam.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.000
What?

12:25.000 --> 12:27.760
You can make blood
with blackberry jam.

12:29.120 --> 12:30.360
Come on.

12:30.360 --> 12:31.840
Let's get it done.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.240
A soda thingy? No.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.760
Mum said they were
a waste of money.

13:30.760 --> 13:32.320
I'd just been to the shops for her

13:32.320 --> 13:33.920
to buy 40 fags
and a bottle of Cinzano.

13:33.920 --> 13:36.280
The irony wasn't wasted.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.480
Honey.

13:38.520 --> 13:40.440
So, how do you know how to use it?

13:40.440 --> 13:43.240
They're not that complicated.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.200
Hey, when we were kids,
if we wanted free stuff,

13:45.200 --> 13:47.320
we had to go down the rec
and do a dance for Dirty Bertie.

13:47.320 --> 13:49.840
I can't believe people
send it you for nothing.

13:49.840 --> 13:52.000
I can't believe
you don't know who I am.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.600
Well, tell me what happened.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.840
When I was 16,
my parents moved to Italy.

13:56.840 --> 13:59.560
I told them I didn't want to go and
they said, "Fine, that's up to you.

13:59.560 --> 14:02.160
"You're old enough to make your own
mind up," and left me in the house.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.080
My Insta went mental.
Loads of jealous little kids

14:04.080 --> 14:05.840
imagining the perfect life
with no rules.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.520
Now I'm rich. The end.

14:07.520 --> 14:09.000
They left you on your own?

14:09.000 --> 14:11.880
I wanted to stay.
Yeah, kids want to eat ice cream

14:11.880 --> 14:14.320
that's been dropped in shit -
they shouldn't be allowed.

14:14.320 --> 14:15.720
You got kids? No.

14:15.720 --> 14:18.280
Then what do you know about it?
I used to be one.

14:18.280 --> 14:21.520
Oh, yeah. In the '80s, where your
parents smoked fags around you

14:21.520 --> 14:23.040
and got drunk on Cinzino.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.600
Cinzano. Whatever.

14:24.600 --> 14:26.960
Yeah. They didn't leave us
behind, though.

14:26.960 --> 14:29.080
I don't need them.

14:29.080 --> 14:30.520
I'm my own parents.

14:30.520 --> 14:33.160
Hmm. All right.

14:35.560 --> 14:36.640
Shall we?

14:59.840 --> 15:02.080
Well, splurge it down.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.760
Splurge it down? No?

15:04.760 --> 15:07.000
Do you know much
about blood spatter?

15:07.000 --> 15:08.760
About as much
as you know about Instagram.

15:08.760 --> 15:10.200
Then listen carefully.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.960
From the scene,
I can tell you straight away

15:11.960 --> 15:13.640
it wasn't the shock
that killed him.

15:13.640 --> 15:14.960
It wasn't? No.

15:14.960 --> 15:17.280
It caused him to spasm, sure,

15:17.280 --> 15:19.440
which meant that
he thrashed around here,

15:19.440 --> 15:21.840
eventually hitting his head
on this cabinet.

15:24.240 --> 15:27.520
Ew. The blood on that wall
was from the head injury -

15:27.520 --> 15:30.160
violent involuntary convulsions
from the shock.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.840
Resulting in light to moderate
blood spatter,

15:34.840 --> 15:38.120
simple enough to remove
from non-porous surfaces.

15:38.120 --> 15:40.800
You'd be amazed how much blood
comes from a head injury.

15:40.800 --> 15:42.520
So, that was what killed him?

15:42.520 --> 15:44.280
A third-degree abrasion?

15:44.280 --> 15:45.960
Oh, my sweet child,

15:45.960 --> 15:47.560
I very much doubt it.

15:47.560 --> 15:49.080
No, he's not done yet.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.840
So he's thrashing around
at the end of a live wire,

15:51.840 --> 15:54.080
receiving electrical burns
at the point of contact,

15:54.080 --> 15:55.560
leading to a bit more
of the old...

15:55.560 --> 15:58.000
Light to moderate blood spatter.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.240
Very good. Yes.

15:59.240 --> 16:01.920
Now, eventually,
he's thrown this way,

16:01.920 --> 16:03.040
where he lands here,

16:03.040 --> 16:04.720
on your glass coffee table.

16:07.360 --> 16:09.320
So, it wasn't the arcade machine
that killed him?

16:10.360 --> 16:12.280
Glass severs arteries.

16:12.280 --> 16:13.320
What does glass do?

16:13.320 --> 16:14.680
Severs arteries.

16:14.680 --> 16:16.320
And arteries are connected to...

16:16.320 --> 16:18.560
The heart. Nature's pump.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.600
Pump Up The Jam.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.080
It's a song.

16:23.320 --> 16:24.960
It doesn't matter.

16:26.000 --> 16:27.600
Can I do it?

16:27.600 --> 16:28.720
I don't know.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.560
Can you?

16:34.800 --> 16:37.640
I was just saying you can have a go.
You should have a go at it.

16:40.360 --> 16:41.680
Ah.

16:43.520 --> 16:44.920
What was that?

16:44.920 --> 16:46.040
No good?

16:46.040 --> 16:48.760
Have you any idea how much blood
the heart pumps around the body?

16:48.760 --> 16:50.200
Put some welly into it!

16:55.640 --> 16:56.680
Now we're talking.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.440
I think you're ready...

16:59.440 --> 17:01.400
Sorry.
I think you're ready.

17:37.920 --> 17:39.800
Enough? Is this what it looked like?

17:39.800 --> 17:42.120
Yeah, it's pretty good.

17:42.120 --> 17:43.320
We just missed one bit.

17:46.600 --> 17:48.000
What the fuck?!

17:48.000 --> 17:50.480
Oh. Sorry, I was just...

17:50.480 --> 17:52.040
What the actual fuck?!

18:08.440 --> 18:10.480
I thought I'd lost you.

18:15.320 --> 18:16.960
Blimey.

18:16.960 --> 18:19.520
Is that a Home Alone Hosea look?

18:19.520 --> 18:20.640
One of them.

18:20.640 --> 18:22.560
I had to change, because somebody

18:22.560 --> 18:24.600
squirted jam in my face.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.200
Yeah, sorry about that.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.480
Got a bit carried away.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.560
Why would you do that?

18:30.920 --> 18:32.680
For fun? Oh, yeah,

18:32.680 --> 18:35.320
cos squirting jam
all over someone is so fun.

18:35.320 --> 18:38.040
You want to have a laugh
more often, you do, mate.

18:38.040 --> 18:40.120
Bet you've never been in there
either, have you?

18:40.120 --> 18:41.240
What?

18:41.240 --> 18:43.760
Four or five cans, couple of
tequilas, I'd be straight in there.

18:43.760 --> 18:45.160
It's for fish.

18:45.160 --> 18:47.160
You and your mates
have never jumped in there

18:47.160 --> 18:49.360
when you're pissed? I don't drink.

18:49.360 --> 18:50.880
What?!

18:50.880 --> 18:52.400
Why?!

18:52.400 --> 18:55.760
I guess cos I'm not
a total loser, that's why.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.720
You've got some space hoppers
back there.

18:57.720 --> 18:59.840
I bet you've never even been on
your space hoppers, have you?

18:59.840 --> 19:01.160
I've got what?

19:02.160 --> 19:03.600
99 Luftballons by Nena

19:03.600 --> 19:05.120
How many followers have you got?

19:05.120 --> 19:06.240
Was five mil,

19:06.240 --> 19:08.280
but this dead guy stream should
get the followers back up.

19:08.280 --> 19:09.640
Five million?

19:09.640 --> 19:11.520
I find it hard enough
to manage five mates.

19:11.520 --> 19:12.840
I only like four of them.

19:12.840 --> 19:14.240
Weasel's on a final warning.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.400
You've got a friend called Weasel?

19:16.400 --> 19:18.000
Yeah. We keep trying
to get rid of him,

19:18.000 --> 19:19.720
but he pulls us back in.

isn't very Home Alone.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.240

21:08.240 --> 21:10.880
Right. I just thought
he was the village idiot.

21:10.880 --> 21:12.920
He manages all the big influencers.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.000
Come on.

21:14.000 --> 21:15.240
What? What do you mean?

21:15.240 --> 21:16.520
Well, you've got to be in it.

21:16.520 --> 21:19.120
What? Why?
Well, to make it look proper.

21:19.120 --> 21:20.680
You can clean up in the background.

21:20.680 --> 21:23.320
Clean up the mess
we've just made? Get lost.

21:23.320 --> 21:25.040
Please.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.680
This is a big deal for me.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.040
Yeah, great. So this is Baxter.

21:39.040 --> 21:41.600
He's our senior consultant
demographer,

21:41.600 --> 21:44.320
so he'll be across, like,
live traffic analysis,

21:44.320 --> 21:45.720
updating user profiles

21:45.720 --> 21:47.880
and multi-platform brand reach...

21:47.880 --> 21:48.920
..and that.

21:50.120 --> 21:51.880
Fuck me, there's two of him.

21:51.880 --> 21:54.120
Dude, can you start...thingy?

21:54.120 --> 21:56.240
Cleaning? Is that the word
you're struggling for?

21:56.240 --> 21:59.120
We are going live any second,
broski.

21:59.120 --> 22:03.120
Well, I mean,
I could rub it with this,

22:03.120 --> 22:05.360
but I'll tell you now, without
the correct chemical formula,

22:05.360 --> 22:06.840
it's just a man moving jam
around a floor.

22:06.840 --> 22:09.520
Please, I'm trying to get
into the right headspace.

22:09.520 --> 22:10.920
I've got standards.

22:10.920 --> 22:13.040
I don't want other crime scene
cleaners seeing this.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.920
Two out of the three of them
are real gossips.

22:14.920 --> 22:17.160
I don't want them chatting shit
about me on the WhatsApp group.

22:17.160 --> 22:18.640
You know what that's like. Please!

22:21.960 --> 22:23.920
Hey, guys and girls
and my nonbinary friends.

22:23.920 --> 22:26.640
So, yesterday,
something mad happened.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.600
Y'all know how much I love the '80s,

22:28.600 --> 22:31.080
so I figured what's more '80s
than an original '80s cabinet?

22:32.400 --> 22:33.480
Bummer alert!

22:33.480 --> 22:36.080
It wasn't wired properly, like,
a fuse had gone or something.

22:36.080 --> 22:39.120
This is when things get freaky.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.040
So this guy came round to fix it

22:45.040 --> 22:46.800
and was, like, super sweet,

22:46.800 --> 22:47.840
but there was, like,

22:47.840 --> 22:51.240
a massive problem with the machine
and it's, like, totally killed him.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.960
So the police sent some
clean-up guy to, like,

22:54.960 --> 22:56.120
clean up and that,

22:56.120 --> 22:59.280
but I just wanted my Hoseas to know
what's been going on with me.

23:01.960 --> 23:04.680
Oh, my God,
look at what is going on.

23:04.680 --> 23:08.040
My poor little cleaner guy.
Isn't he cute?

23:09.800 --> 23:12.320
So, apparently, it wasn't
the shock that killed him.

23:12.320 --> 23:13.760
That's why there was so much blood.

23:13.760 --> 23:16.320
That's what you were saying, right?

23:16.320 --> 23:18.760
Uh... Yes?

23:18.760 --> 23:21.200
Well, tell... Tell the guys

23:21.200 --> 23:22.760
what you were saying about,
you know,

23:22.760 --> 23:25.480
the coffee table and something about
the artery.

23:25.480 --> 23:26.600
Oh.

23:28.440 --> 23:29.640
Oh.

23:29.640 --> 23:31.560
You can see from the blood
on the wall

23:31.560 --> 23:33.880
that this was actually
the first injury.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.760
The victim would have fallen
and hit his head here,

23:36.760 --> 23:38.360
against this cabinet,

23:38.360 --> 23:40.800
causing this blood spatter pattern.

23:42.000 --> 23:44.040
But it wasn't the head injury
that killed him, was it?

23:44.040 --> 23:46.360
That's what you were telling me.
Oh, no, no.

23:46.360 --> 23:49.440
This is actually nowhere near
as bad as it looks.

23:49.440 --> 23:51.880
You can see that from...
The blood pattern

23:51.880 --> 23:54.400
is actually quite localised
from the abrasion.

23:55.960 --> 23:57.720
Ooh.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.560
What is this?

24:03.040 --> 24:05.440
Mm. Sticky!

24:05.440 --> 24:07.920
Ooh, now, that is interesting.

24:07.920 --> 24:10.360
That's actually
the victim's wedding ring.

24:10.360 --> 24:12.400
You see, during electrocution,

24:12.400 --> 24:14.120
even the small muscles
in the hand,

24:14.120 --> 24:16.080
they would tighten,
causing it to fall off.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.800
It's intriguing what you find out
about victims in this job.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.480
From that,
we know he was married.

24:20.480 --> 24:23.120
From a picture I found
in his wallet earlier,

24:23.120 --> 24:25.800
I can tell you
he had three small children.

24:25.800 --> 24:29.000
Shut up!
This is not about the dead guy!

24:33.360 --> 24:34.520
Not cool, bro!

24:35.800 --> 24:38.600
OK, the stuff about the kids
was too much.

24:38.600 --> 24:40.040
Let's go again!

24:44.560 --> 24:47.040
Please! You're cancelled.
You're cancelled. You're done.

24:47.040 --> 24:48.080
Me? You are cancelled.

24:48.080 --> 24:49.920
We'll rebrand. We can't rebrand.

24:49.920 --> 24:52.160
New vibes, new things.
You can't uncancel a cancel.

24:52.160 --> 24:54.240
I'm done. This is done. You're done.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.240
You're cancelled. And we're done.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.160
And I'm out. OK?

24:58.160 --> 24:59.920
I'm out.

25:20.400 --> 25:22.480
I bought you a cola-flavoured soda.

25:23.520 --> 25:26.560
They're not allowed to call it Coke
for legal reasons.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.200
And because it tastes like piss.

25:31.000 --> 25:32.560
They'll forget.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.440
They'll never forget.

25:35.440 --> 25:36.760
It's there forever.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.320
Where? In the cloud.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.160
Is it?

25:42.440 --> 25:45.160
You been sending dick pics, Grandad?
No.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.640
Wish I was born in the '80s.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.040
Yeah, it was good.

25:50.040 --> 25:51.320
No internet.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.080
No phones.

25:53.080 --> 25:55.360
Endless summers.
Yeah, all right, I get it.

25:55.360 --> 25:57.480
The Exxon Valdez oil spill.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.680
The Challenger disaster.

25:59.680 --> 26:01.120
Chernobyl.

26:01.120 --> 26:03.920
What? Yeah.

26:03.920 --> 26:05.720
The '80s are just like now -

26:05.720 --> 26:08.080
really great and really shitty.

26:08.080 --> 26:09.760
Don't believe the hype.

26:09.760 --> 26:12.200
Ugh. Jam everywhere.

26:12.200 --> 26:14.520
Yeah. Funny, innit?

26:14.520 --> 26:17.520
In many ways, it's harder
to get out than blood.

26:19.200 --> 26:20.480
I'm like Lady Macbeth.

26:20.480 --> 26:22.520
Out, damned jam?

26:24.080 --> 26:25.720
You've not seen it, have you?

26:27.400 --> 26:28.960
No. No.

26:28.960 --> 26:31.280
Course you haven't.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.640
I'll show you a good way
to get jam out.

26:36.640 --> 26:38.960
You're not going to... I am.

26:38.960 --> 26:40.760
But you haven't even got jam
on you. No.

26:40.760 --> 26:41.880
I've got no jam on me.

26:41.880 --> 26:44.320
I'm going to jump in the pond
just for the sake of it.

26:45.520 --> 26:46.560
Oi.

26:46.560 --> 26:48.200
Put your phone away.

26:48.200 --> 26:49.640
Just do a thing.

26:55.240 --> 26:56.400
Fuck it!

27:14.960 --> 27:17.560
Oh, God, it's freezing!

27:19.120 --> 27:20.560
That is actually awful.

27:20.560 --> 27:21.840
What's that smell?

27:21.840 --> 27:23.040
That's fish shit.

27:23.040 --> 27:24.640
And duck shit.

27:24.640 --> 27:26.960
Ugh! We should've
just jumped in the hot tub.

27:28.080 --> 27:29.600
In the what?

27:31.040 --> 27:32.640
Yeah.

27:32.640 --> 27:34.280
Yeah, you're right, this is better.

27:34.280 --> 27:36.560
Mm. We're like
the Real Housewives of Atlanta.

27:36.560 --> 27:38.320
I know! Right?

27:38.320 --> 27:40.080
You've not seen it, have you?

27:40.080 --> 27:41.320
No.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.000
So, what happened next,

27:43.000 --> 27:44.960
after you jumped in a pond
in the '80s?

27:44.960 --> 27:47.000
Oh, my mum'd bollock us
for getting wet

27:47.000 --> 27:48.760
and then feed us watery minced beef.

27:48.760 --> 27:50.600
My life's not so bad, is it?

27:50.600 --> 27:52.600
No!

27:52.600 --> 27:56.800
But maybe leave Hosea at home
for a bit.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.600
Go and see some
real-world stuff, eh?

28:01.160 --> 28:03.320
What is your real name?

28:03.320 --> 28:04.640
Bernard.

28:04.640 --> 28:05.840
Yeah, stick with Hosea.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.560
Bernard.

28:13.520 --> 28:16.400
You do know Home Alone
was filmed in the '90s, right?

28:16.400 --> 28:18.440
It's not '80s.

28:18.440 --> 28:19.680
It's been pointed out to me.

28:19.680 --> 28:20.960
Ah.

28:22.440 --> 28:23.840
Now the '90s...

28:24.880 --> 28:28.080
..they were amazing.
