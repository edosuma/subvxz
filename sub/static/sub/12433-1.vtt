00:36.180 --> 00:37.580
Where to?

00:37.680 --> 00:39.510
Anthony's in there.

00:39.580 --> 00:41.010
I can't leave him.

00:41.080 --> 00:43.020
I left a note.

00:43.090 --> 00:48.490
Where to?

01:15.120 --> 01:16.520
<i>Shots fired.</i>

01:16.590 --> 01:19.680
<i>Drop your weapon!</i>

01:19.750 --> 01:22.120
<i>Get him out back, quickly.</i>

01:22.220 --> 01:24.060
<i>God damn it.</i>

01:24.130 --> 01:25.590
<i>Eight minutes
till backup arrives.</i>

01:25.690 --> 01:26.920
<i>- You know what to do?
- Sir.</i>

01:27.030 --> 01:29.550
<i>Scrub and remove
all bodies.</i>

01:38.440 --> 01:41.310
<i>- Hey.
- Yes, Sir?</i>

01:41.380 --> 01:42.710
<i>Did you find a girl?</i>

01:42.780 --> 01:45.080
<i>No, Sir.
No female body.</i>

02:02.430 --> 02:04.660
How's the front
of the store?

02:04.730 --> 02:07.670
Scrubbed, no traces.
Just like you asked.

02:08.770 --> 02:12.400
- Where's his other phone?
- That's all we found on him.

02:12.470 --> 02:14.440
Okay.
You want to go find it?

02:14.510 --> 02:16.170
- Yes, Sir.
- Thank you.

02:16.280 --> 02:18.680
<i>You want to try
and stop the bleeding?</i>

02:18.780 --> 02:23.240
- It's down to the bone.
- Administer adrenaline.

02:23.320 --> 02:24.620
Clear for paddles.

02:24.690 --> 02:27.350
Clear.

02:32.190 --> 02:33.680
I got the cooler. Hurry.

02:33.760 --> 02:35.090
No phone.
Just this.

02:35.160 --> 02:39.860
Oh, jeez.
Oh, God.

02:39.940 --> 02:41.930
I'm sorry.

02:42.940 --> 02:45.370
- What was that?
- His eyeball is still inside.

02:45.470 --> 02:46.940
Along with most of his face.

02:47.010 --> 02:48.100
Some of the muscle...

02:48.180 --> 02:49.470
fused to the mask.

02:49.540 --> 02:51.270
- You... you okay?
- Yes, Sir.

02:51.350 --> 02:52.780
Oh, good.

02:52.850 --> 02:53.970
He's not,
so why don't you...

02:54.050 --> 02:55.210
fucking stabilize him?

02:55.280 --> 02:56.720
Sorry, Sir.

02:56.820 --> 02:58.290
- Follow C-7 protocol.
- Yes, Sir.

02:58.350 --> 02:59.950
<i>The surgeons are already
en route.</i>

03:00.020 --> 03:01.610
<i>Should I take his car
and meet you there?</i>

03:01.720 --> 03:05.120
Or you could follow
C-7 protocol like I said.

03:05.190 --> 03:06.390
I'm sorry.
Did I stutter?

03:06.490 --> 03:08.220
No, I did not stutter.

03:08.330 --> 03:10.230
Here, take this. Keys.

03:10.330 --> 03:11.730
Please. Keys.

03:11.830 --> 03:13.200
Thank you.
Go with the crew.

03:13.300 --> 03:15.960
His heart rate,
it's stable.

03:16.040 --> 03:17.900
He's got a bullet wound, too.

03:17.970 --> 03:19.840
<i>Looks like he
stitched it himself.</i>

03:19.910 --> 03:21.900
Aren't you
coming with us?

03:23.580 --> 03:26.740
I'll meet you there.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.930
All right, I'll go get
you something to eat.

03:51.770 --> 03:55.370
Then I have to go home.
I have to leave you here.

03:57.250 --> 04:00.540
All right, I'll...
I'll be back soon.

04:13.400 --> 04:17.019
I'm so sorry
about your friend.

04:18.100 --> 04:22.730
You know, we were best friends
since we were six years old.

04:26.140 --> 04:28.440
It's not your fault.

04:29.610 --> 04:33.980
Who you were before this
day doesn't matter.

04:37.090 --> 04:39.990
Blank slate.

04:40.420 --> 04:42.320
I have a really
bad headache.

04:42.390 --> 04:44.320
All right,
before I leave town...

04:44.430 --> 04:47.450
I- I'll get you
some aspirin, too.

05:02.840 --> 05:05.340
<i>I know you only paid
for a blow job...</i>

05:05.410 --> 05:08.410
<i>but don't you want
a little more?</i>

05:08.480 --> 05:10.680
<i>You didn't tell me
you were making a movie.</i>

05:10.790 --> 05:12.690
Anthony's gone.

05:13.790 --> 05:15.780
There's just
a lot of blood.

05:26.030 --> 05:28.300
I swapped his mask glue
with cyanoacrylate.

05:28.370 --> 05:31.970
It's the superest
of all glues.

05:45.490 --> 05:47.790
Aah!

06:46.050 --> 06:47.880
A blank slate.

06:51.720 --> 06:53.380
Shh!

06:55.060 --> 06:56.520
You're gonna
come with me, okay?

06:56.590 --> 06:58.290
- No!
- Yeah.

06:58.390 --> 06:59.860
You're coming with me.
We're gonna...

06:59.930 --> 07:01.050
...go to the car, okay?
- No!

07:01.130 --> 07:03.690
- No! No!
- Shhh! Shut up!

07:03.770 --> 07:07.460
I swear to God,
I will fucking slash you...

07:07.570 --> 07:09.970
if you make one sound, okay?

07:10.040 --> 07:12.470
You hear me?
All right?

07:12.570 --> 07:14.740
I'm gonna take
my hand away now...

07:14.810 --> 07:16.540
and you just be quiet, okay?

07:16.610 --> 07:19.210
All right? Be nice
and quiet for me, okay?

07:19.280 --> 07:21.480
It's okay.

07:21.550 --> 07:24.580
There you go.

07:43.470 --> 07:46.600
Wow...

08:35.789 --> 08:37.220
I'm sorry
it took so long.

08:37.330 --> 08:40.780
I got turned around
on the way back.

08:42.799 --> 08:47.290
So I'm... I'm
gonna take off now.

08:47.370 --> 08:50.340
I need to get home.

08:52.370 --> 08:55.070
So are you gonna
be okay here?

08:58.010 --> 09:01.110
Do you have any money?

09:11.190 --> 09:12.320
Fuck!

09:26.740 --> 09:30.180
I don't even know
where to start.

09:33.850 --> 09:37.580
Swab and clamp.

09:44.690 --> 09:47.790
Get as much tissue
as you can from the mask.

09:47.900 --> 09:50.360
Swab.

10:00.910 --> 10:03.100
Hand it to me.

10:05.880 --> 10:08.580
- His heart rate is slowing.
- I think he's dreaming.

10:08.650 --> 10:10.080
It looks like he's I N.

10:10.150 --> 10:13.920
Increase the morphine
drip 5 cc's.

10:18.960 --> 10:22.760
Increase the irrigation.

10:22.830 --> 10:24.630
Touch it.

10:25.770 --> 10:28.170
Can I have the skin?

10:40.520 --> 10:42.950
Graft the stitches.

10:52.090 --> 10:55.930
Yes, it's coming
into place now.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.300
Don't be afraid.

11:04.710 --> 11:06.870
Suture.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.820
Cross clamps.

11:24.190 --> 11:26.960
Responding well.

11:27.030 --> 11:30.660
Bring the healing mask.

11:39.140 --> 11:40.400
Here's Dr. Kerr.

11:40.510 --> 11:42.240
<i>We did what we could.</i>

11:42.340 --> 11:46.970
He's still not much to
look at, but he'll live.

11:47.050 --> 11:49.980
Good. Money's been wired to
your account in Switzerland.

11:50.050 --> 11:51.580
Stick around and make sure
to monitor him.

11:51.690 --> 11:53.920
I'll take care
of your accommodations

11:53.990 --> 11:55.180
and go over your needs.

11:55.260 --> 11:57.160
Thank you, Mr. Preston.

11:59.230 --> 12:02.360
- Spann?
- Yes?

12:02.430 --> 12:05.400
Knock next time.

12:13.070 --> 12:15.840
So the victim checks in
with the kid.

12:15.910 --> 12:18.670
The kid says he went out
to get some food...

12:18.750 --> 12:23.180
gets back,
she's like this.

12:23.250 --> 12:27.020
All right.
Put the kid in my car.

12:38.900 --> 12:40.870
Sloppy.

12:40.940 --> 12:42.400
First timer.

12:42.470 --> 12:46.130
Somebody was in a hurry.

12:50.140 --> 12:52.740
Hey, King, I found
this in the bathroom.

12:52.810 --> 12:55.080
It was in her jeans.

12:55.150 --> 12:58.140
- Any I. D.?
- Negative. That's where the struggle was.

12:58.250 --> 13:00.310
- Is that the real thing?
- Cha-ching.

13:00.420 --> 13:04.920
All right, Max. Take it to the lab.
Do your thing, yeah?

13:08.230 --> 13:09.990
Who are you?

13:10.100 --> 13:14.930
Why do you have a $10,000 phone
in a $50 motel room?

13:18.410 --> 13:19.930
<i>How's your game?</i>

13:20.010 --> 13:22.670
- Are you fucking kidding me?
- Sorry, Sir.

13:28.420 --> 13:32.940
So I took care
of all the business...

13:33.020 --> 13:38.620
on both... both of them,
just like I always do.

13:40.030 --> 13:42.260
Hey, Boss.

13:42.330 --> 13:46.130
Are you in there?
Can you hear me?

13:48.000 --> 13:51.800
I've got a present for you.

13:53.010 --> 13:55.270
I found her.

13:55.340 --> 13:58.310
I found the whore,
and I killed her for you.

14:00.050 --> 14:02.540
Your knife
was so sharp...

14:02.620 --> 14:08.390
it was way easier than
I thought it would be.

14:08.460 --> 14:10.450
I had to.

14:10.520 --> 14:11.990
She was a loose end.

14:13.660 --> 14:15.220
L... I didn't know
about the barn.

14:15.330 --> 14:17.230
And I didn't know
about the old mortician...

14:17.300 --> 14:19.390
that you made
the cash deal with.

14:19.470 --> 14:23.060
Let's keep it here.
I can contain it all here.

14:23.140 --> 14:27.040
I've already... I've already
cleaned everything up for you.

14:35.020 --> 14:37.140
Tell us why we're here.

14:37.220 --> 14:39.310
Jess, this is stupid.
Stop it.

14:39.390 --> 14:42.910
<i>Okay, I'm gonna film us
on end till you tell us.</i>

14:43.020 --> 14:46.430
We are here because
we're worried about your eyes.

14:46.490 --> 14:48.430
Now, put that thing away.

14:48.530 --> 14:51.260
Oh, okay.

14:53.770 --> 14:56.000
Hi, what's this?

14:56.070 --> 14:58.100
<i>Oh, Jess is documenting
everything.</i>

14:58.210 --> 14:59.930
<i>I'm sorry, Doctor.</i>

15:00.040 --> 15:01.440
<i>Put that away so he
can check your eyes.</i>

15:01.510 --> 15:03.000
<i>I have a good idea.
Here, Mom.</i>

15:03.080 --> 15:04.510
<i>I don't know
how to use it.</i>

15:04.580 --> 15:06.840
<i>Mom, just
hold it steady.</i>

15:06.910 --> 15:10.440
Fine.

15:10.520 --> 15:14.350
So have you noticed
any change in your vision?

15:14.420 --> 15:16.890
Has it gotten worse
in the last week?

15:16.960 --> 15:18.390
Yeah, a lot.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.290
<i>Tell him about
the halos, Jess.</i>

15:20.360 --> 15:23.960
The halos, yeah.

15:24.030 --> 15:25.620
Any pain?

15:25.730 --> 15:27.860
Um, yeah.

15:27.940 --> 15:30.060
Okay.

15:30.140 --> 15:36.080
Uh, I don't think
you want this on tape.

15:41.050 --> 15:43.640
<i>I've never seen a patient
with acanthamoeba...</i>

15:43.720 --> 15:47.750
<i>progress so quickly with all
this additional scar tissue.</i>

15:47.820 --> 15:50.990
It's really quite unusual.

15:51.090 --> 15:52.820
So am I going blind?

15:52.890 --> 15:55.160
Listen, I want you
to stay calm...

15:55.260 --> 15:58.600
but I want to go ahead and
schedule surgery for Monday...

15:58.670 --> 16:02.760
before any more
scar tissue develops.

16:02.840 --> 16:04.770
- Okay.
- All right?

16:04.840 --> 16:08.570
I'm gonna write a prescription
for some medications.

16:08.640 --> 16:11.670
I think that'll help.

16:11.750 --> 16:13.580
All right?

16:13.650 --> 16:16.010
All right. So listen, I don't
want you guys to panic.

16:16.080 --> 16:18.950
There's a lot
we can do.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.920
And I'll see you Monday
morning, all right?

16:20.990 --> 16:25.080
- Thank you, Doctor.
- Okay, thanks.

16:30.700 --> 16:33.790
- Great. You left it on.
- I'm sorry.

16:33.870 --> 16:35.130
No, now it's...

16:35.200 --> 16:37.530
- I'm sorry.
- It's done.

17:39.430 --> 17:42.600
You don't need to hide.

17:42.700 --> 17:45.400
I'll help you.

17:49.110 --> 17:52.440
Jess's video diary,
Wednesday.

17:52.550 --> 17:56.110
Uh, really excited
for the concert tonight.

17:56.180 --> 18:00.950
Allie is gonna come over
and do my makeup.

18:01.020 --> 18:06.520
These old eyes just ain't
what they used to be, kids.

18:06.590 --> 18:10.460
Uh, um, well...

18:10.560 --> 18:13.120
there is a silver lining...

18:13.200 --> 18:15.290
and that is...

18:15.400 --> 18:16.800
drum roll.

18:16.870 --> 18:18.530
# Dah dah dah dah #

18:18.610 --> 18:20.470
# Doo doo doo doo #

18:20.540 --> 18:24.880
Legal medicinal marijuana,
bitches.

18:26.710 --> 18:31.150
I'm really nervous
about getting this surgery...

18:31.250 --> 18:36.160
but I don't want to go
totally blind...

18:36.220 --> 18:38.320
so...

18:38.390 --> 18:41.230
You got to do
what you got to do.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.990
Okay.

18:43.060 --> 18:45.590
Uh, I got to get to work.

18:45.670 --> 18:47.100
Peace.

18:57.010 --> 18:59.570
<i>She's gone.</i>

18:59.650 --> 19:00.980
And it was selfish of him...

19:01.050 --> 19:03.950
to rob you
of that last kiss.

19:04.020 --> 19:09.010
But I'll leave you
with a little something.

19:30.380 --> 19:35.310
There's plenty of fish
in the sea.

20:02.040 --> 20:03.410
What?

20:03.510 --> 20:06.480
- He's anxious.
- "He's anxious."

20:06.550 --> 20:08.240
What the hell
does that mean?

20:09.820 --> 20:11.340
It means
I have been instructed...

20:11.420 --> 20:14.250
to create
a new play space.

20:18.530 --> 20:19.920
Why didn't he
come to me?

20:19.990 --> 20:22.190
I'm not sure.

20:23.830 --> 20:25.090
It's the old
chrome plating factory...

20:25.200 --> 20:26.860
that the shelter company owns.

20:26.930 --> 20:29.100
I'm having the crew
set it up, all the fixings.

20:29.170 --> 20:32.100
You could take it from here
if you like.

20:32.210 --> 20:33.670
I'll handle it.

20:33.740 --> 20:35.270
I fucking handle
everything anyway.

20:35.380 --> 20:38.210
Have you seen him?
He's fucking useless.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.440
He's toast.

20:39.550 --> 20:40.910
You know what?

20:41.020 --> 20:42.110
Let him have
his last bit of fun...

20:42.180 --> 20:44.120
before he croaks.

20:44.220 --> 20:48.180
Please get the fuck
out of my office.

20:48.260 --> 20:49.280
Now.

20:53.030 --> 20:56.020
I hate her.

21:06.040 --> 21:08.800
Great.

21:12.150 --> 21:14.550
<i>You're high.</i>

21:14.620 --> 21:15.740
I love this.

21:15.820 --> 21:17.580
Okay, one more
for me.

21:17.650 --> 21:19.550
I'm getting
super-duper high.

21:19.620 --> 21:21.250
<i>Jess's video diary.</i>

21:21.320 --> 21:23.220
What is this?

21:23.290 --> 21:26.260
<i>I'm really excited
about the concert tonight.</i>

21:26.330 --> 21:28.060
It's my diary.

21:28.130 --> 21:29.490
Your diary?

21:29.600 --> 21:31.150
You talk to yourself
on camera?

21:31.270 --> 21:32.890
I like talking to myself.

21:32.970 --> 21:34.630
Do you make YouTubes?

21:34.740 --> 21:36.930
I'm gonna make a YouTube
of you right now.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.670
Oh, good.

21:38.770 --> 21:40.600
- You're so pretty.
- You're making me nervous.

21:40.670 --> 21:42.670
Hey, you know, I'm gonna
show this to your momma.

21:42.740 --> 21:45.010
Do it.

21:45.080 --> 21:46.600
I love you, Mom.

21:48.480 --> 21:52.180
What if one day I can't
see all of these videos?

21:52.250 --> 21:53.740
<i>Oh, God.</i>

21:53.820 --> 21:56.020
That's bullshit.

21:56.860 --> 22:00.190
The operation's gonna work.
You'll be fine.

22:00.260 --> 22:03.200
Yeah? Well...

22:03.300 --> 22:08.200
I'm just gonna memorize
all of this...

22:08.300 --> 22:09.860
'cause...

22:09.970 --> 22:12.700
It might not work.

22:12.810 --> 22:14.210
Okay, enough.

22:14.310 --> 22:16.280
I am not coming
to your pity party.

22:17.950 --> 22:19.540
But I am gonna go
make some popcorn.

22:19.610 --> 22:21.440
- Oh, yeah.
- And you're gonna get dressed.

22:21.520 --> 22:22.880
Okay.

22:22.980 --> 22:24.610
And I think
I'll drive tonight.

22:24.690 --> 22:27.880
- Oh, thank you.
- All right, get dressed.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.050
- Woo!
- Ooh, she likes it.

22:31.130 --> 22:33.560
Okay, I'll see you
in a sec.

23:31.750 --> 23:32.780
Aah!

23:32.890 --> 23:34.380
Jess!

23:38.560 --> 23:41.620
Get the fuck out of this house
or I will fucking kill you!

23:44.470 --> 23:46.130
Help!

24:31.410 --> 24:33.110
What the fuck
is going on?

24:33.180 --> 24:35.910
The girl who lives here
is missing.

24:35.980 --> 24:37.510
The mother's downstairs.

24:37.580 --> 24:40.450
She discovered the body.

24:40.520 --> 24:43.350
- And the father?
- Dead. Cancer took him.

24:43.460 --> 24:45.790
- That definitely rules him out.
- Yeah.

24:47.290 --> 24:49.690
Figured you
might want this.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.460
I will take that.

24:51.530 --> 24:53.090
Run that footage
as soon as you get back.

24:53.170 --> 24:55.530
I got a bad feeling
about this, Max.

24:55.600 --> 24:59.040
I don't expect
a ransom call.

24:59.110 --> 25:02.470
<i>What if one day I can't
see all of these videos?</i>

25:02.540 --> 25:04.100
<i>- Oh, God.
- What?</i>

25:04.180 --> 25:05.800
<i>- That's bullshit.
- Uhh!</i>

25:05.880 --> 25:09.320
<i>The operation's gonna work.
You'll be fine.</i>

25:09.380 --> 25:12.650
<i>Yeah? Well...</i>

25:12.720 --> 25:15.810
<i>I'm just gonna memorize...</i>

25:15.890 --> 25:17.880
<i>...all of this...
- Stop.</i>

25:17.990 --> 25:19.190
Go back.

25:20.160 --> 25:21.390
There.

25:22.730 --> 25:25.220
The kid with the
girl in the motel.

25:25.330 --> 25:27.460
Yeah, the one who
described the killer...

25:27.530 --> 25:29.060
wearing something
just like that?

25:29.170 --> 25:31.690
I want him
in here. Now.

26:45.150 --> 26:48.050
- Chasing the dragon again?
- Fucking hell.

26:48.120 --> 26:50.380
Sorry.

26:52.050 --> 26:55.920
You still owe me for
last month's rent.

26:55.990 --> 26:57.960
I know.

26:58.060 --> 26:59.790
Tommy, my parents aren't
sending money anymore.

26:59.890 --> 27:03.160
I'm a student.
I can't afford to cover your share.

27:03.230 --> 27:06.320
I know.

27:06.430 --> 27:09.660
Can you have it to me
by Monday?

27:09.740 --> 27:12.670
Yes, all right,
I'll have it to you. Shit.

27:12.740 --> 27:15.770
And stop smoking
in the apartment.

27:15.840 --> 27:18.240
Oh, Christ.

27:41.470 --> 27:44.100
<i>I knew that before
he even opened his mouth.</i>

27:44.170 --> 27:48.130
<i>We're gonna get you, dude.
We're gonna get you.</i>

27:48.210 --> 27:50.040
<i>Do you really think
I should shave my head?</i>

27:50.110 --> 27:51.770
<i>- Uh...
- And my eyebrows?</i>

27:51.850 --> 27:53.180
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

27:53.280 --> 27:54.440
<i>Won't that be
kind of scary...</i>

27:54.510 --> 27:56.040
<i>like Uncle Fester scary?</i>

27:56.150 --> 27:58.550
<i>No. You don't gotta do it,
but let me do it.</i>

28:01.960 --> 28:03.720
Jesus.

28:03.820 --> 28:08.780
<i>Sexy bitches are
my favorite kind of bitches!</i>

28:08.860 --> 28:09.850
<i>Woo-oo!</i>

28:09.960 --> 28:11.230
<i>We survived it.</i>

28:14.470 --> 28:15.900
<i>Shit, clown...
your biggest fear.</i>

28:16.000 --> 28:17.300
<i>Your biggest fear.</i>

28:17.370 --> 28:19.070
<i>- Aah!
- Don't provoke him.</i>

28:19.140 --> 28:21.070
<i>Don't provoke him.</i>

28:21.170 --> 28:23.070
<i>You fuckin'
creep me out.</i>

28:23.140 --> 28:25.010
<i>Jeez!</i>

28:25.080 --> 28:28.240
<i>Dude, you have no fucking
idea where we're going.</i>

28:37.020 --> 28:39.080
<i>Jeez!</i>

28:39.160 --> 28:42.090
<i>Like it with your girl, huh?</i>

28:42.200 --> 28:45.260
Jesus fucking Christ.

28:48.000 --> 28:49.330
<i>Let's still change these.</i>

28:49.400 --> 28:52.670
<i>Okay, we'll
keep her pinned.</i>

28:54.170 --> 28:56.940
<i>This part
is a little creepy.</i>

28:57.010 --> 28:59.500
<i>I can't tell
which one is real.</i>

28:59.580 --> 29:02.550
<i>Dude, it's too hard,
and I can't see shit.</i>

29:33.880 --> 29:35.580
Don't.

29:35.650 --> 29:37.640
No, don't.

30:04.780 --> 30:07.010
Laurie?

30:13.850 --> 30:16.690
Whoa. Hey, kid,
take it easy.

30:16.790 --> 30:19.120
It's Max, from Homicide.

30:19.190 --> 30:23.420
My roommate, she didn't
answer just now, and...

30:23.500 --> 30:25.090
That's okay.
She probably just went out...

30:25.170 --> 30:27.100
for some food or
something, all right?

30:27.170 --> 30:29.140
Listen, we need you to
come down to the station.

30:29.200 --> 30:31.600
Why? L-l-already
told you everything.

30:31.670 --> 30:35.770
We'd really
appreciate it, okay?

30:37.340 --> 30:41.470
It’ll be all right.

30:41.550 --> 30:44.140
How far is your car?

30:49.690 --> 30:52.890
You know, I never
even got her name.

30:57.030 --> 30:58.460
Yep.

30:58.530 --> 31:00.160
<i>Ready in here.
Bring the kid in.</i>

31:00.500 --> 31:02.400
Okay, thanks.

31:04.500 --> 31:06.560
Take a look at this.

31:06.670 --> 31:09.800
Was this the mask you saw?

31:21.920 --> 31:23.720
You're sure?

31:23.820 --> 31:25.980
'Cause a couple months ago
when we brought you in...

31:26.060 --> 31:27.750
you told me
this guy was dead...

31:27.860 --> 31:29.690
that the girl killed him.

31:29.760 --> 31:31.490
Well, dead guys
don't just get up...

31:31.560 --> 31:34.560
and they sure as hell don't
keep killing people.

31:55.090 --> 31:57.450
Help.

31:57.560 --> 32:01.650
Help.
I can't... can't...

32:05.130 --> 32:07.460
Help!

32:07.570 --> 32:10.370
Help! Help!

32:10.440 --> 32:11.270
Please.

32:13.440 --> 32:15.100
Help!

32:44.270 --> 32:48.730
Cut it.
Put it down.

32:48.810 --> 32:50.110
Do me a favor.

32:50.180 --> 32:52.110
Take, uh...
take six of these...

32:52.180 --> 32:53.340
and strip the handle down...

32:53.450 --> 32:56.180
and then weld them...

32:56.250 --> 32:59.510
weld them together like a star.
Like this, right?

32:59.590 --> 33:05.530
With the blades facing each
other like scissors, all right?

33:05.590 --> 33:07.360
And then, um...

33:07.460 --> 33:09.020
put... put some springs

33:09.130 --> 33:11.790
in the middle here
for tension, all right?

33:11.870 --> 33:15.360
- Got that? It make sense?
- Oh, yeah, yeah, we got it.

33:15.440 --> 33:17.430
Go ahead.

33:30.820 --> 33:34.220
<i>I'm a little
depressed today.</i>

33:34.290 --> 33:36.220
<i>It was, um...</i>

33:36.320 --> 33:38.310
<i>too dark in my room even
with the shades pulled...</i>

33:38.390 --> 33:43.230
<i>so I am retreating out
into the sun.</i>

33:43.330 --> 33:47.560
<i>There it is.</i>

33:47.630 --> 33:50.660
<i>I like the sun.</i>

33:50.740 --> 33:52.730
<i>I have nothing.</i>

33:52.810 --> 33:55.140
<i>Oh, God.</i>

33:55.210 --> 33:59.140
<i>I'm trying to be, um...</i>

33:59.210 --> 34:01.510
<i>trying to see the light...</i>

34:01.580 --> 34:03.140
at the end of the tunnel.

34:03.220 --> 34:05.480
<i>No pun intended.</i>

34:05.550 --> 34:07.990
<i>I just feel like...</i>

34:08.050 --> 34:10.489
<i>it just keeps
getting darker...</i>

34:10.560 --> 34:15.489
<i>and there's nothing
I can do about it.</i>

34:19.230 --> 34:22.260
You shouldn't be in here.

34:22.370 --> 34:25.199
Where am I supposed to be?

34:26.270 --> 34:28.330
Why don't you go get
some coffee?

35:03.240 --> 35:04.900
Where are you going?

35:04.980 --> 35:06.740
Fuck this.
He took out a police station?

35:06.810 --> 35:09.370
You never told me that.
I'm not safe here. I'm not.

35:09.450 --> 35:11.470
Look, I know what this
guy does, all right?

35:11.550 --> 35:14.080
And that girl doesn't
have very long.

35:14.150 --> 35:16.150
Nobody's coming
for you here.

35:16.260 --> 35:19.710
This isn't Ashville Canyon.
We have a lot of cops with guns.

35:19.790 --> 35:21.590
Sit down.

35:21.660 --> 35:23.990
Could I at least
have a cigarette?

35:24.100 --> 35:28.000
It's a no-smoking
building.

35:28.100 --> 35:31.970
Knock yourself out.

35:37.680 --> 35:42.640
So I need for you to tell me
some more about this mask.

35:48.960 --> 35:50.350
It doesn't have
a strap.

35:50.460 --> 35:53.910
It's, um... some kind of glue.

35:53.990 --> 35:55.690
The Steven guy said
it was glued on.

35:55.800 --> 35:57.160
But wait, you said
it was metal.

35:57.260 --> 35:58.920
Well, it was really
shiny, you know.

35:59.000 --> 36:03.130
- More like... like chrome.
- Chrome? You sure?

36:03.200 --> 36:05.030
Yep. He even had
a license plate...

36:05.140 --> 36:08.130
that had
"chrome something" on it.

36:08.210 --> 36:10.940
Chromeskull.
Yeah, we ran that plate.

36:11.010 --> 36:12.670
All the
different spellings.

36:12.780 --> 36:15.270
It's a fake plate
Nobody has that plate.

36:15.350 --> 36:16.540
So it's glued.

36:16.650 --> 36:19.210
So it must be lightweight.

36:19.290 --> 36:20.720
No, this is good.

36:20.820 --> 36:22.720
Hey, Holland.
I need for you to check...

36:22.790 --> 36:25.660
every shop within 50 miles
that does chrome plating.

36:25.730 --> 36:27.990
I'm on it.

36:28.360 --> 36:29.890
You okay?

36:32.670 --> 36:37.030
Guess I've finished
my coffee now.

36:38.400 --> 36:41.740
Help! Help!

36:45.550 --> 36:46.740
Please!

36:50.880 --> 36:52.540
Sir, it, uh...

36:52.650 --> 36:54.350
it seems as though
you've been moving forward...

36:54.420 --> 36:56.910
without informing us.

36:56.990 --> 36:59.750
Listen, you really... you need
to keep us in the loop...

36:59.860 --> 37:01.490
all right?
I- I really...

37:01.590 --> 37:03.930
I really don't want
the same situation to happen...

37:04.000 --> 37:06.660
that happened
the last time.

37:08.430 --> 37:10.270
- Excuse me, could you...
- Oh, my God. Oh!

37:10.340 --> 37:12.000
- Aah! Oh, God!
- Shut up.

37:12.070 --> 37:14.040
Come on, it's a little
fucking piece of tape...

37:14.110 --> 37:17.040
and I swear to God, if you move,
I'll kill you, all right?

37:17.110 --> 37:18.870
I'm having
a conversation here.

37:20.680 --> 37:22.610
Listen, I can... I can do
some of the legwork...

37:22.680 --> 37:24.620
for you, you know?

37:24.680 --> 37:27.950
All right, but did you realize
that the girl wasn't alone...

37:28.050 --> 37:30.550
that there was a kid named
Tommy that was with her?

37:30.620 --> 37:32.610
You know, I've been
busting my ass...

37:32.730 --> 37:35.250
trying to track him down?

37:35.930 --> 37:37.290
Right now I'm feeling...

37:37.400 --> 37:38.730
I'm feeling
really unappreciated.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.560
You realize
that that kid can...

37:40.630 --> 37:44.430
he can lead them to you
and to us and all of this?

37:46.610 --> 37:48.300
<i>Damn it!</i>

37:48.370 --> 37:50.370
You want to
fucking go rogue

37:50.440 --> 37:56.210
and... and... and get your face
fucked, fine.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.480
You know what?
You're so lucky...

37:58.550 --> 38:00.540
that he's not here
to taste you yet.

38:00.620 --> 38:03.990
You're really fucking tough.

38:04.060 --> 38:05.650
He's gonna do
horrible shit to you.

38:05.730 --> 38:08.060
You know that?
Horrible fucking things.

38:08.130 --> 38:10.560
Gross, gross fucking things.

38:10.630 --> 38:12.390
I mean,
they make me sick.

38:12.470 --> 38:14.230
You know
what I don't get?

38:14.300 --> 38:16.930
I don't get the fanfare
and the fucking exhibition.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.660
You know what?

38:18.770 --> 38:22.100
I'm a fucking Band-Aid
technique kind of guy.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.080
You want to know
what he, uh...

38:25.140 --> 38:28.840
what he does to 'em,
in the coffins?

38:28.950 --> 38:30.350
No, come here.

38:42.130 --> 38:44.460
All right.

38:44.530 --> 38:47.020
We got three factories
in the vicinity.

38:47.130 --> 38:49.260
Owners are all clean,
no priors.

38:49.340 --> 38:53.530
Closest one is about 20 miles
from here, towards Miami.

38:53.640 --> 38:55.630
You just punched in.
Go check it out.

38:55.710 --> 38:58.870
We can't get a warrant,
so, by the book, yeah?

38:58.980 --> 39:00.470
You got it.

40:20.060 --> 40:22.190
Please.

40:33.310 --> 40:35.140
Help.

40:44.580 --> 40:47.280
Help!

41:03.100 --> 41:07.510
Help!
Help! Someone!

41:11.640 --> 41:13.670
- It's Holland.
- All right, thanks.

41:13.750 --> 41:16.270
- Hey, what you got?
- I'm at the location.

41:16.350 --> 41:20.410
- It seems pretty abandoned.
- Anything suspicious?

41:20.490 --> 41:23.250
Is the kid from the motel
still with you?

41:23.320 --> 41:27.120
<i>Ask him what the exact spelling
of the license plate was.</i>

41:27.190 --> 41:28.850
C- R-M-S-K...

41:28.960 --> 41:33.920
Hey, that license plate,
one "L" or two "L"s?

41:34.000 --> 41:35.870
C- R-M-S-K-L-L.

41:35.940 --> 41:38.630
That didn't get us
anything, you know?

41:38.700 --> 41:40.300
Yeah, I'm poking around.

41:40.370 --> 41:42.810
I'll let you know
what I find out.

41:46.010 --> 41:47.980
Oh, God.

41:58.560 --> 41:59.790
Hello?

42:02.190 --> 42:03.630
Mommy?

42:03.700 --> 42:05.460
Jessica, my God,
where are you?

42:07.130 --> 42:08.290
What do you mean?

42:13.340 --> 42:14.810
They took me...

42:14.870 --> 42:16.500
and they're gonna come
and hurt me.

42:16.580 --> 42:18.370
Who wants to hurt you?

42:18.480 --> 42:19.740
Tell me where you are.
I'll come and get you.

42:19.850 --> 42:23.250
I don't know.
I don't know.

42:25.520 --> 42:26.820
Mommy, I have to go.

42:26.890 --> 42:29.480
No! No!
Don't you hang up!

42:29.560 --> 42:30.990
Jessica, where are you?

42:31.060 --> 42:32.420
Mom, they're coming
to get me.

42:32.490 --> 42:35.590
I just love you
so much.

42:35.700 --> 42:37.060
Je...

42:39.930 --> 42:42.490
Je...

42:47.510 --> 42:48.440
Oh.

42:50.080 --> 42:51.770
<i>I can't get
to the phone right now...</i>

42:51.880 --> 42:53.870
<i>so leave a message,
biatch.</i>

43:00.790 --> 43:02.780
We're going to see
your boss.

43:19.610 --> 43:22.770
By the book.

43:30.080 --> 43:32.980
Drop it!

44:20.530 --> 44:23.530
Uh...

44:23.640 --> 44:25.700
Aah!

44:25.770 --> 44:27.140
Aah! No!

44:27.210 --> 44:29.540
Aah!

45:33.170 --> 45:34.940
I want to talk to him now!

45:35.010 --> 45:36.600
A little help here, Max?

45:36.680 --> 45:38.940
My daughter called.
My daughter's alive.

45:39.040 --> 45:40.940
Okay, Mrs. Cannon,
I need you to calm down.

45:41.010 --> 45:42.840
- I'm not gonna calm down!
- Did Jess say where she was?

45:42.920 --> 45:44.610
No, she was scared,
and they drugged her.

45:44.680 --> 45:46.120
- Does she know who took her?
- No, no!

45:46.220 --> 45:47.520
Did they ask
for anything, money?

45:47.590 --> 45:49.350
She said once
he was coming...

45:49.420 --> 45:51.120
- Okay, did they...
- And there was a lot of noise...

45:51.220 --> 45:53.090
in the background.
I want to talk to your boss.

45:53.190 --> 45:55.290
Okay, let's go to King.
Come on.

46:08.440 --> 46:09.530
<i>The girl's mom is here.</i>

46:09.610 --> 46:11.440
She just
called her.

46:12.710 --> 46:14.240
Yeah.

47:13.110 --> 47:14.970
Aah! No! Please!

47:15.040 --> 47:16.940
Why are you doing this?

47:17.010 --> 47:19.030
No, please!

47:19.110 --> 47:23.450
Please!
Please don't do this!

47:23.520 --> 47:24.880
Please!

47:24.950 --> 47:28.480
Please stop!

47:28.550 --> 47:30.720
Sit!

47:43.400 --> 47:44.660
Max, check
the phone records.

47:44.740 --> 47:46.200
See where the phone call
came from.

47:46.310 --> 47:49.400
I'm gonna need
your phone, Ma'am.

47:50.810 --> 47:55.250
- Will that work?
- Hopefully.

47:55.350 --> 47:58.480
Max is the best we got.

47:58.550 --> 48:02.320
But she's
my only child.

48:02.390 --> 48:04.410
She's everything.

48:04.490 --> 48:06.750
She's alone
and scared.

48:06.860 --> 48:11.020
And... and she
can't see very well.

48:11.100 --> 48:12.830
Jesus. Why?

48:12.900 --> 48:15.160
Why would somebody
take her?

48:15.230 --> 48:20.370
It doesn't...
it doesn't make any sense.

48:20.440 --> 48:22.070
It doesn't.

48:22.170 --> 48:25.610
Mrs. Cannon, I have a...
I have a daughter.

48:25.680 --> 48:29.110
I can't pretend to understand
what you're going through...

48:29.210 --> 48:32.880
but I will do everything
I can to find Jess.

48:32.950 --> 48:37.620
I promise you, I will not
sleep until Jess comes home.

48:37.690 --> 48:42.420
- I promise.
- Thank you.

48:57.640 --> 49:00.700
- How you doing?
- All right.

49:32.110 --> 49:33.510
Um, uh, sorry.

49:33.610 --> 49:35.240
Can I see you
for a second, please?

49:35.310 --> 49:39.080
- Did it work?
- We're working on it, Ma'am.

49:39.150 --> 49:41.180
Excuse me a moment.

49:41.250 --> 49:43.080
- The kid's gone.
- He's what?

49:43.160 --> 49:44.590
I can't find him
anywhere.

49:44.660 --> 49:47.250
- Did he run?
- I don't think so.

49:47.330 --> 49:50.120
It looks like he could've
been dragged out of here.

49:50.200 --> 49:53.100
Shit! Check in with Holland,
see if she's got anything.

49:53.170 --> 49:54.660
If not, get her ass
back here now.

49:54.770 --> 49:59.140
- We got to find that kid, Max.
- Got it.

50:20.190 --> 50:23.460
Listen, Sir.
Please let me go.

50:23.530 --> 50:26.560
I promise, no one
will know except me.

50:29.870 --> 50:32.530
You're really pretty,
you know that?

50:33.970 --> 50:37.240
I'm sorry you've had to
just sit around and wait.

50:37.340 --> 50:40.900
He's usually pretty punctual.
It's kind of his thing.

50:45.650 --> 50:47.240
I'm gonna let you breathe...

50:47.350 --> 50:51.410
for a little while,
all right?

50:51.490 --> 50:53.150
I'm almost
legally blind.

50:53.230 --> 50:55.190
I would never be able
to identify you.

50:56.930 --> 50:58.760
What?

51:00.200 --> 51:02.190
I'm almost
legally blind.

51:02.270 --> 51:05.200
I promise, I won't be
able to identify you!

51:05.270 --> 51:07.930
Aah! Aah!

51:13.610 --> 51:14.600
Should I give you
to him?

51:15.680 --> 51:17.770
No, no.

51:18.250 --> 51:19.740
Should I take you
myself?

51:19.850 --> 51:22.790
I could use
the practice.

51:26.930 --> 51:30.520
You know what?

51:30.600 --> 51:32.890
You're right.

51:32.970 --> 51:38.300
It's not the... it's not the mask
that's intimidating.

51:38.400 --> 51:41.430
It's the man behind it.

51:46.110 --> 51:50.140
<i>It's not the
mask that's intimidating.</i>

51:50.220 --> 51:51.650
<i>It's the man behind it.</i>

51:51.720 --> 51:53.580
You're making
the right decision.

51:53.650 --> 51:55.280
He's mocking you now?

51:55.390 --> 51:57.910
He's the one who decides
who lives or dies?

52:17.140 --> 52:19.580
Rest assured.

52:19.650 --> 52:23.450
This will all go smoothly.

52:29.290 --> 52:33.450
<i>Who the hell is that?</i>

52:35.530 --> 52:38.190
Homicide.

52:38.260 --> 52:40.130
Really?

52:40.200 --> 52:42.630
Hey, King?
I can't get a hold of Holland.

52:42.700 --> 52:44.930
- Did she call in?
- I checked with Dispatch.

52:45.000 --> 52:48.100
- Nothing since we last spoke.
- How many people?

52:48.170 --> 52:49.700
Hey.

52:49.780 --> 52:52.140
Yeah, okay.
Yeah, well, thanks.

52:52.210 --> 52:57.980
Kid's roommate?
Found dead down in Cobb County.

52:58.050 --> 52:59.710
All sliced up.

52:59.790 --> 53:01.080
Fuck.

53:01.120 --> 53:05.320
So Holland was, uh, here.

53:05.390 --> 53:08.220
And Cobb is the opposite
direction from us.

53:08.290 --> 53:10.730
- What, 40 miles?
- Yeah.

53:10.800 --> 53:12.530
So we send everything up here.

53:12.630 --> 53:15.230
She has to find their phone.
Needs charging.

53:15.300 --> 53:17.290
We don't have
that kind of time.

53:17.370 --> 53:19.390
<i>Well, I could head
out there.</i>

53:19.470 --> 53:21.170
If I see something,
I won't make a move.

53:21.240 --> 53:23.400
I'll just call it in and
keep an eye on things.

53:23.480 --> 53:24.970
Yeah, that's good.

53:25.040 --> 53:26.640
We send two detectives
to Cobb County

53:26.710 --> 53:27.970
to check with the locals
and the roommate...

53:28.050 --> 53:29.910
see if Tommy's there.

53:30.020 --> 53:33.350
I got a feeling that he's in
the same place that Jess is.

53:33.420 --> 53:37.050
You two?
Do the buddy-cop thing.

53:47.770 --> 53:50.170
This is gonna be over quick,
all right?

53:50.240 --> 53:53.690
So one way or the other,
one of us is gonna slice you.

53:56.580 --> 53:59.270
All right.

53:59.340 --> 54:02.440
Sss-sss-sss-sss.

54:02.510 --> 54:04.850
- Ahh!
- Sit there.

54:04.920 --> 54:07.180
Box seat.
You'll like that.

54:10.520 --> 54:14.860
Aah!

54:14.930 --> 54:15.860
Okay.

54:20.470 --> 54:23.060
Hey, boss, you, uh...

54:23.140 --> 54:24.970
You recognize this kid?

54:25.040 --> 54:27.200
He was, uh...
he was with the girl in Ashville.

54:28.970 --> 54:30.870
It's another loose end.
I fixed it, though.

54:30.940 --> 54:32.430
I, uh... that's what I do.

54:32.540 --> 54:34.710
I am a fixer.
It's what you pay me for.

54:36.450 --> 54:37.880
Listen, I know he's not
your type...

54:37.950 --> 54:39.880
so can I just kill him
real quick?

54:39.950 --> 54:44.390
If that's all right
with you?

54:44.460 --> 54:45.980
It's up to you.

55:04.810 --> 55:06.570
Uhh!

55:45.550 --> 55:50.610
Why don't you two
run around the facility...

55:50.690 --> 55:52.280
a little bit...

55:52.360 --> 55:53.980
find something to hit me
in the head with...

55:54.060 --> 55:57.620
or stab me with?

55:57.700 --> 55:59.890
Something fun.

56:02.230 --> 56:05.570
I'll be right back...

56:05.640 --> 56:09.230
and then
I'll find you two.

57:11.140 --> 57:14.800
It's going
right here.

58:10.360 --> 58:12.260
Shake them.

58:12.330 --> 58:13.630
Just go slow.

58:13.700 --> 58:15.630
Oh, God!

58:15.700 --> 58:18.290
Shit!

58:21.040 --> 58:22.030
Aah!

58:22.140 --> 58:23.470
You all right?

58:23.540 --> 58:25.130
You okay?
All right, untie me.

58:25.210 --> 58:26.940
Listen, we really
gotta hurry up.

58:27.010 --> 58:28.540
We got to find
a safe place.

58:28.650 --> 58:30.270
I don't know why
they want to kill me.

58:30.350 --> 58:31.680
I haven't done
anything.

58:31.780 --> 58:33.770
Me neither, okay?

58:33.850 --> 58:35.820
I don't know about this guy
but the one with the mask...

58:35.890 --> 58:38.620
he kills girls and
videotapes it, all right?

58:38.690 --> 58:40.450
It's his thing.

58:40.530 --> 58:43.150
That's what this girl told me,
and she's dead now.

58:43.230 --> 58:44.990
Aah!

58:45.060 --> 58:46.050
Shh!

58:48.870 --> 58:50.230
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

58:50.300 --> 58:52.670
Calm down.

58:52.740 --> 58:55.970
Wait.
He had a mask on, too.

58:56.040 --> 58:57.300
Then he got her,
or they did.

58:57.380 --> 58:58.970
I don't know.
Listen to me.

58:59.040 --> 59:00.740
We have to focus, okay?
Because he's right.

59:00.850 --> 59:03.910
This place is locked up,
and we've got nothing.

59:06.150 --> 59:07.910
Not actually nothing.

59:07.990 --> 59:09.750
- What the fuck?
- No, no.

59:09.850 --> 59:13.090
The signal, it makes these
loud air horns go off.

59:23.000 --> 59:26.440
Give me a hand.
I'm gonna move this.

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:13.080
All right, all right.
I'll go down first.

01:00:13.150 --> 01:00:14.950
No, no, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:16.990
What if there's no way
out from underneath?

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.390
What? No. We could get trapped.

01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:21.050
If there's
a signal down there...

01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:23.220
it might be able to
shield the feedback

01:00:23.290 --> 01:00:24.820
from the thing, right?

01:00:24.930 --> 01:00:26.420
- Wait, wait. No.
- Just shh, shh!

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:27.730
Please, you have to
calm down.

01:00:29.330 --> 01:00:31.100
Put this on and stay
calm for me, okay?

01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:33.400
We're gonna
get out of here.

01:00:43.010 --> 01:00:44.570
Shh. Wait here.

01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:45.580
Wait.

01:00:45.650 --> 01:00:47.310
Okay.

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.050
You okay?

01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.280
Okay.

01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:27.620
Toss me down the phone.

01:01:33.400 --> 01:01:35.060
Hurry!

01:02:06.230 --> 01:02:08.760
It's working.

01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:14.200
Homicide. King.

01:02:14.270 --> 01:02:16.100
Yeah, it's me, Tommy.

01:02:16.210 --> 01:02:18.000
- I'm on the girl's phone.
- It's the kid on two.

01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:19.510
What's your name?

01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:21.770
- Jess.
- Jess. I'm on Jess's phone.

01:02:21.850 --> 01:02:25.710
He stuck something in my neck,
so I don't know where we are.

01:02:25.780 --> 01:02:28.510
Okay, slow down. Who took you?
Give me a description.

01:02:28.590 --> 01:02:31.020
Uh... tall, 6'1 ".

01:02:31.090 --> 01:02:32.780
Uh, dark, thick hair.

01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:35.690
It's definitely not
the bald freak in the mask.

01:02:41.970 --> 01:02:43.590
<i>Get here.
Hurry, okay?</i>

01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:47.540
Listen, I'm sorry, kid,
but the, uh...

01:02:47.610 --> 01:02:51.910
we... we... we think the same...
the same people got your roommate.

01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:56.900
What?

01:02:56.980 --> 01:02:59.810
Hello?

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.480
Look, we're tracing the call.

01:03:01.550 --> 01:03:03.250
<i>Just... just stay where you are.</i>

01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:05.310
All right.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:09.320
They're tracing the call.

01:03:09.390 --> 01:03:11.620
We could hide
down here.

01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:16.900
So can we... can we hide
down there?

01:03:16.970 --> 01:03:19.330
They were looking
for me.

01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:20.840
What?

01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:24.430
They're...
they're tracing the call.

01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:27.500
- Come on.
- Wait. What's going on?

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.030
What are those?

01:03:45.360 --> 01:03:46.800
Pain pills.

01:03:49.870 --> 01:03:51.860
Why do you have those?

01:04:01.210 --> 01:04:02.870
All right.

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:05.970
We're just looking
for anything suspicious.

01:04:06.050 --> 01:04:08.710
Yeah, like Holland's
car right there?

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:11.690
Shit. All right.

01:04:11.790 --> 01:04:13.480
Hold on.
I'm gonna call it in.

01:04:16.630 --> 01:04:19.220
Hey, it's Max.

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:21.990
Tell the chief we see Holland's
car, but no Holland.

01:04:22.070 --> 01:04:23.830
Yeah, use that
as probable.

01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:26.060
<i>Why don't you get
the boys out here?</i>

01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:28.040
Shit, Tiny.

01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:35.740
Hey, Max, Holland could be
in some real shit.

01:04:35.810 --> 01:04:38.300
- We got to get inside there.
- Or it could be nothing.

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:40.080
I'm gonna go
take a look inside.

01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:42.140
Ho, ho, ho, take it easy.

01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:46.180
All right, we walk the perimeter
of the building, all right?

01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:47.690
But we do not go inside.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:50.490
You go that way.
I'll go this way.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:54.400
- We meet in the middle.
- Yeah.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.870
<i>Hey, Tiny.</i>

01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:38.740
<i>You see anything?</i>

01:05:38.810 --> 01:05:40.870
I'm already inside.

01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:43.540
<i>North side of the building,
there's a door...</i>

01:05:43.610 --> 01:05:45.310
<i>parking area.</i>

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.960
Shit.

01:05:55.060 --> 01:05:56.550
I know it might not
look like it...

01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:58.460
but this is the safest
place we can be.

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.720
We just need to find something
to keep that door shut...

01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:03.600
so look around.

01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:05.660
Wait, wait.
What about, um...?

01:06:05.740 --> 01:06:07.930
This, if we use...
The chain.

01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:09.840
Yes.

01:06:30.190 --> 01:06:34.290
Tiny?
Which way did you go?

01:06:34.370 --> 01:06:36.600
Holy shit.

01:06:41.170 --> 01:06:43.110
Fuck.

01:06:50.050 --> 01:06:52.110
Tiny?

01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:54.780
Fuck off, Max.

01:07:08.130 --> 01:07:09.790
Max.

01:07:09.870 --> 01:07:11.730
I got a shitload
of blood in here...

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:15.300
and what looks like Holland's
badge on the ground.

01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:20.570
Go call it in from the car.

01:07:20.650 --> 01:07:23.080
You copy?

01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:24.140
Tiny?

01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:33.080
Shit.

01:08:10.260 --> 01:08:12.560
They're coming.

01:08:12.630 --> 01:08:14.290
Okay, I know,
I know, I know!

01:08:14.370 --> 01:08:19.130
That's not
gonna stop him!

01:08:19.200 --> 01:08:20.359
Go.

01:08:31.950 --> 01:08:33.140
What do we do now?

01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:36.319
Try not to die.

01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:43.490
Fuck you!

01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:46.649
Stay back.

01:09:15.330 --> 01:09:18.020
They know where we are,
motherfucker!

01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:20.590
- They're coming!
- Oh, yeah?

01:09:20.670 --> 01:09:24.160
Well, you'll be dead
by then.

01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:33.100
Oh, fuck you!
Fuck you!

01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:35.609
I've done
everything for you!

01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:37.380
Fuck you!

01:09:37.450 --> 01:09:40.279
That little fucking bitch
can't do what I do!

01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:43.120
You can't fucking do
what I do!

01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:45.120
Aah!

01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:46.450
Motherfucker!

01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:48.319
Aah!

01:09:48.990 --> 01:09:52.490
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:55.620
Don't, don't, don't.
Don't, come on.

01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:57.900
Wait, wait, wait!
This is a mistake, okay?

01:09:57.970 --> 01:09:59.400
You're making a mistake.

01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:00.970
Can we just talk
about this, please?

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:04.300
Please, can we talk
about this, huh?

01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:09.340
Okay.

01:10:09.410 --> 01:10:11.850
Aah, hey.
Hey, hey.

01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:13.750
I know you, right?
I know you.

01:10:13.850 --> 01:10:17.050
I know you better than anybody
else fuckin' knows you.

01:10:21.330 --> 01:10:24.490
Fuck. I fucked up, okay?

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:26.260
I fucked up,
all right?

01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:28.030
That's it.
I just, like... fuck!

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:30.360
I just
made a mistake, okay?

01:10:30.430 --> 01:10:31.830
I made a fucking mistake!

01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:34.700
Cut me some slack,
all right?

01:10:35.410 --> 01:10:39.000
Aw, just cut me
some slack. Look.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:43.670
Hey, hey.
You can teach me, okay?

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:45.770
Just teach me
everything you know.

01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:48.440
I'll start from the ground
floor, I swear to God.

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:50.780
I fucked up, man.

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:53.190
I'm sorry.

01:10:56.530 --> 01:10:58.720
Will you teach me?

01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:27.980
Leave us the fuck alone!

01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:02.690
Shh.

01:12:02.790 --> 01:12:05.960
All right. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

01:12:06.030 --> 01:12:07.930
Aah!

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.690
Oh, my God!

01:12:10.770 --> 01:12:11.930
Oh, God.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.530
Look for his red light.

01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:15.370
Look for the red light.
You can see him.

01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.530
Fuck.

01:12:18.610 --> 01:12:20.940
It hurts.

01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:30.780
Aah!

01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:34.020
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:42.860
It's him,
it's him, it's him.

01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:51.570
- Here! Wait.
- Put your foot in here.

01:12:51.640 --> 01:12:52.870
Wait.

01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.240
I dropped it.

01:12:55.350 --> 01:12:56.470
I dropped the flashlight.

01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:57.570
Shit!

01:12:57.680 --> 01:12:58.710
Get the flashlight!

01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:01.750
L... l... kicked it.

01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:11.880
Come on! Get it!

01:13:13.230 --> 01:13:15.700
Aah!

01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:20.260
No!

01:13:25.940 --> 01:13:27.500
Run!

01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:30.010
Run! Get the fuck
outta here!

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.170
Go! Go!

01:13:52.200 --> 01:13:53.070
Aah!

01:14:09.490 --> 01:14:10.720
Stop!

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.230
Die! Die!

01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.510
Aah!

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:50.080
No!

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.820
No! Aah!

01:14:54.030 --> 01:14:56.020
No!

01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:58.630
No! No!

01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:02.670
No!

01:15:08.210 --> 01:15:10.870
No! No!

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:22.620
No!

01:15:32.540 --> 01:15:35.630
No, please.

01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:42.710
No, please!

01:15:48.820 --> 01:15:50.580
No!

01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:04.530
No!

01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:07.330
<i>No!</i>

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:09.900
Stop.

01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:17.880
Who's got the layout?

01:16:17.950 --> 01:16:19.210
- Right here.
- Me and Trost...

01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:20.940
will sweep
the west side.

01:16:21.050 --> 01:16:22.180
You guys take the rookie.
Sweep the east side.

01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:23.620
Be safe and be smart.

01:16:23.720 --> 01:16:25.020
We got a possible
three cops down...

01:16:25.090 --> 01:16:26.060
and two civilians.
You set?

01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:27.680
Let's go.

01:16:30.090 --> 01:16:32.190
<i>No!</i>

01:16:32.260 --> 01:16:33.520
Clear!

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.720
You guys
get ready now.

01:16:34.800 --> 01:16:35.790
Trost, you're with me.

01:16:37.100 --> 01:16:39.630
This is the police!

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:41.530
Any and all persons
in the building...

01:16:41.610 --> 01:16:43.200
better make
themselves known!

01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:48.310
Oh, Max!

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:56.650
<i>No!</i>

01:16:56.750 --> 01:16:58.240
What are these?

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.590
Looks like outs and stuff.
Switchers.

01:17:00.660 --> 01:17:04.990
Cut 'em.
Cut 'em all.

01:17:09.670 --> 01:17:10.830
That... that's...

01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:12.430
that's not a recording.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.230
She's alive.

01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:15.830
Jessica!

01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:17.340
Help!

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:21.910
Hands on your head!
Turn around!

01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:23.310
You! Come out of there now!

01:17:23.410 --> 01:17:25.510
We can hear her!
Where is she?

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:27.080
On the ground! Now!

01:17:27.150 --> 01:17:28.350
Where's the girl?

01:17:28.450 --> 01:17:29.480
I said get out of there!

01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:30.950
- Now!
- Cuff him!

01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:32.680
I ain't gonna
fuckin' cuff him.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:33.810
Let the rookie.

01:17:33.920 --> 01:17:36.920
Get in there, man.

01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:38.520
Put your hands
on your head!

01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:40.590
Don't take your eyes
off him.

01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:42.360
Turn around!

01:17:49.770 --> 01:17:52.260
Let him go!
Let him go!

01:17:52.340 --> 01:17:53.500
Take the shot!

01:17:53.610 --> 01:17:55.640
I can't
take the shot!

01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:58.210
Wah! Aah!

01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:16.060
Aah! Cut it out! No!

01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:17.070
Aah!

01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:20.800
You fuckin'...

01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:24.130
What the f...

01:18:24.210 --> 01:18:26.730
No! Please! Please!

01:18:26.810 --> 01:18:29.400
Please! No!

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:46.150
Help!

01:18:46.230 --> 01:18:47.660
He's gonna kill me!

01:18:47.730 --> 01:18:48.860
Help!

01:19:01.710 --> 01:19:03.940
No!

01:19:04.050 --> 01:19:04.880
Please!

01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:06.440
Unh!

01:19:23.430 --> 01:19:24.460
Stop!

01:19:24.570 --> 01:19:26.470
This is the police!

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:53.490
Jessica?

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:54.590
It's the police!

01:19:54.670 --> 01:19:56.660
I'm here! Hurry!

01:19:56.730 --> 01:19:58.600
Help!

01:19:58.670 --> 01:20:00.230
I'm here! Hurry!

01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:02.170
You're safe now!

01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:09.100
Hey, King.

01:20:09.180 --> 01:20:10.340
Aah!
Aah!

01:20:12.850 --> 01:20:14.750
Aah! No!

01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:20.950
Unh!

01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.690
Trost!

01:20:25.330 --> 01:20:27.920
Aah!

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:29.300
No!

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:49.950
Please! Stop!

01:20:50.020 --> 01:20:51.390
Aah!

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:21.250
Aah!

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.360
Ah!

01:21:33.660 --> 01:21:36.860
Leave him alone! No!

01:21:36.930 --> 01:21:39.060
Don't you need this,
you sick fuck?

01:21:47.010 --> 01:21:49.440
I guess you can't
kill me now!

01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:07.960
Aah!

01:22:43.400 --> 01:22:44.590
Come on.

01:24:14.830 --> 01:24:16.420
Aah! No!

01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:21.060
Aah! Aah!

01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:29.570
Ugh!

01:24:43.190 --> 01:24:45.280
I got you.
It's okay.

01:25:05.140 --> 01:25:06.440
Shh. Shh.

01:25:06.540 --> 01:25:07.870
You're safe now.
It's okay.

01:25:07.940 --> 01:25:10.410
It's okay. Shh. Shh.

01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.380
I got you.

01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:30.560
Detective King,
I'm Agent Sells from the FBI.

01:25:30.630 --> 01:25:33.600
If we can get
Miss Cannon in the car.

01:25:33.670 --> 01:25:36.730
Can I see
some I D's, please?

01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.100
No.

01:25:39.180 --> 01:25:40.610
You're safe, you're safe.

01:25:40.680 --> 01:25:42.110
You're safe.
It's okay, it's okay.

01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:44.410
I'll be there soon.

01:25:48.920 --> 01:25:52.080
Get the paramedics
to check her leg.

01:25:56.860 --> 01:25:58.920
When did this
become a Federal case?

01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:01.360
I can't discuss
any details...

01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:03.190
about this
investigation.

01:26:03.300 --> 01:26:05.270
We've been tracking him
for quite some time.

01:26:05.340 --> 01:26:08.430
This location finally
gave us a name and a face.

01:26:08.510 --> 01:26:10.000
You been watching us...

01:26:10.110 --> 01:26:11.630
knowing he was gonna
spill more blood?

01:26:11.710 --> 01:26:13.970
He killed my whole
fucking department.

01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.380
I'm afraid
I can't discuss...

01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:16.780
...any details...
- You're welcome.

01:26:16.850 --> 01:26:18.340
We'll take over
from here.

01:26:18.450 --> 01:26:20.880
I'll need your reports
and your files.

01:26:21.520 --> 01:26:25.610
You can file the request
with my replacement.

01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:29.150
We'll get you home
to your mom.

01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:14.830
The full operation
will be moved by next week.

01:27:14.900 --> 01:27:17.340
And might I commend you...

01:27:17.410 --> 01:27:19.600
on your new choice
of scenery?

01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:28.010
I will take care
of everything.

01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:32.250
We'll find the girl
and resume with the plan.

01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.380
Until then...

01:27:34.460 --> 01:27:36.360
enjoy yourself.

01:30:22.190 --> 01:30:26.620
# Die #

01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:28.530
# Laid to rest #

01:30:30.470 --> 01:30:31.960
# Die #

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.370
# Laid to rest #

01:30:35.540 --> 01:30:37.060
# Die #

01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:38.870
# Laid to rest #

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:42.300
# Die #

01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:44.140
# Laid to rest #

01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:47.310
# Die #

01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:49.320
# Laid to rest #

01:30:51.290 --> 01:30:52.480
# Die #

01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:54.490
# Laid to rest #

01:30:56.230 --> 01:30:57.720
# Gonna die #

01:30:57.790 --> 01:31:00.090
# Laid to rest #

01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:02.560
# Gonna die #

01:31:02.630 --> 01:31:06.230
# Laid... to... rest ##

01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:16.270
Mrs. Cromeans, I know
how difficult this must be.

01:31:16.350 --> 01:31:18.010
You don't know.

01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:19.610
We were gonna
start a family.

01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:21.910
Everything was perfect.

01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:23.350
Men like this.

01:31:23.450 --> 01:31:24.940
They like to create
an illusion.

01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:27.080
They need to maintain
that cover.

01:31:27.160 --> 01:31:28.820
What goddamn cover?

01:31:28.930 --> 01:31:31.920
When was the last time
you saw your husband?

01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:34.190
A few months ago.

01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:36.260
So what?

01:31:36.330 --> 01:31:38.860
He goes on
long business trips.

01:31:40.940 --> 01:31:42.870
Show me then.

01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:44.700
Show me what he's done...

01:31:44.810 --> 01:31:47.780
and if I believe you, I will
help you any way I can.

01:31:55.650 --> 01:31:57.280
These are
screen captures...

01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:59.880
taken from the videos
he sent to local police...

01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:01.650
in the different cities.

01:32:15.370 --> 01:32:19.070
That's his tattoo.

01:32:19.180 --> 01:32:20.570
Why...

01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:22.980
why is he laying on her
like that?

01:32:28.250 --> 01:32:31.020
It's not true.

01:32:31.090 --> 01:32:32.820
He's coming home.

01:32:32.890 --> 01:32:34.320
He's not coming home.

01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:36.020
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

01:32:36.090 --> 01:32:38.150
He's made himself this way.
He's a monster.

01:32:58.620 --> 01:32:59.950
<i>Drop it!
Drop the gun!</i>

01:33:00.050 --> 01:33:03.420
Put the gun down!
Put it down!
