Here's your stuff, Bennett.

00:10.844 --> 00:11.803
Yeah, we'll see.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.206
Where's my TRESemmé conditioner?

00:42.292 --> 00:44.544
-This is everything you came in with.
-No.

00:46.254 --> 00:47.088
[sniffs aggressively]

00:47.172 --> 00:48.048
Ah, of c--

00:49.716 --> 00:52.052
That's my shea butter and hibiscus oil.

00:52.677 --> 00:54.637
Sign the fucking papers!

00:54.846 --> 00:57.265
Hey, Wilkerson. Why you look so good?

00:59.601 --> 01:01.352
You doin' something different
with your hair?

01:02.103 --> 01:03.813
No, but thank you.

01:03.897 --> 01:04.939
[phone ringing]

01:07.067 --> 01:09.277
Make a copy of your paperwork,
and you can get outta here.

01:10.737 --> 01:12.322
Hey. So what the hell happened?

01:12.489 --> 01:14.783
I thought you'd be in here
for at least a couple nights.

01:14.866 --> 01:17.118
Better call Abby
and tell her not to come over.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.038
I don't know.

01:20.121 --> 01:23.083
I was sitting in my cell,
definitely not cryin'.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.087
Old Wilkerson comes in,
told me they dropped the charges.

01:28.004 --> 01:30.215
So... Lisa Neumann caved.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.382
Fuck, yeah!

01:33.343 --> 01:36.137
She folded like Kenny Rogers
when he knew not to hold 'em.

01:38.431 --> 01:39.474
Here you go.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.851
-Here's your conditioner.
-Ah-ha.

01:44.104 --> 01:45.188

03:02.056 --> 03:03.725
Guess who just beat Lisa Neumann.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.102
I'll give you a hint.

03:06.186 --> 03:07.270
I'm standing next to a guy

03:07.353 --> 03:09.647
with some impressive equipment
in his slacks.

03:16.487 --> 03:17.322
It's Colt.

03:20.909 --> 03:24.329
You're outta jail 'cause I just sold
Lisa Neumann Iron River.

03:26.164 --> 03:26.998
What?

03:27.498 --> 03:29.584
In exchange for her dropping the charges

03:30.126 --> 03:31.461
and keeping the dam down.

03:32.420 --> 03:33.963
You got everything you wanted.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.466
Jesus! You sold this place?

03:36.925 --> 03:37.842
Okay, Dad...

03:39.135 --> 03:41.638
I appreciate what you're doing here. Okay?

03:41.930 --> 03:44.265
But I... I had this.

03:44.641 --> 03:47.560
You didn't have shit!
You were in a goddamn jail cell!

03:47.644 --> 03:49.729
Just 'cause I was in jail
don't mean I was gonna lose!

03:50.355 --> 03:52.607
She had no right to put that dam up.

03:53.024 --> 03:54.525
And a jury would have said so.

03:55.193 --> 03:57.362
Now you go back
and tell her the deal's off,

03:57.445 --> 03:58.529
and I'll go back to jail.

03:58.613 --> 03:59.572
It's done.

Iron River's been in this family
for a hundred fuckin' years!

04:06.079 --> 04:07.497
[shouting] You just gave it away?

04:07.747 --> 04:10.333
She had pictures of you
blowing up her dam.

04:11.042 --> 04:14.879
-You weren't gonna get outta this.
-Well I guess we'll never know, will we?

04:25.598 --> 04:26.474

If you'd have just left it alone,
I coulda saved both of our ranches.

Your whole life is full of things
you coulda done.

I guess we all can't...

04:50.415 --> 04:51.332
Luckily,

04:52.250 --> 04:53.793
we got the great Beau Bennett.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.170

05:37.462 --> 05:39.797
great idea to do this now, but...

05:40.882 --> 05:41.716
Here.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.314
Why would you give me Will Vallery's paper

05:56.397 --> 05:59.233
on the importance
of John Adams' contribution to America?

05:59.317 --> 06:00.193
[Abby] No.

06:00.651 --> 06:01.486
Shit. Hmm.

06:02.111 --> 06:04.364
That was... supposed to be
our divorce papers.

06:04.572 --> 06:05.448
What did I give Will?

06:08.576 --> 06:10.286
How dumb is this Will guy, anyway?

06:10.370 --> 06:12.455
It's not John Adams, it's Sam Adams.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.457
And course he's important,
he invented beer.

06:31.265 --> 06:34.268

-I hope she's not getting sick.
-[Peyton grumbles]

07:03.047 --> 07:06.634
Maybe I should try and get outta
this field trip and stay home with her.

07:07.093 --> 07:07.969
Really?

07:08.052 --> 07:09.137
[dog barking]

07:09.220 --> 07:11.180
Look, I know we had our disagreements,

07:11.722 --> 07:12.807
but I'm a good dad.

07:13.641 --> 07:14.684
If her temperature goes up,

07:14.767 --> 07:17.437
I'll give you a call.
I'll make sure she drinks a lot of fluids.

07:17.520 --> 07:20.022
And, no, it won't be Bud Light,
like when I'm sick.

07:22.608 --> 07:23.484
Okay, fine.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.362
Just text me right away
if anything changes

07:26.696 --> 07:28.614
but double-check first. I mean,

07:28.823 --> 07:31.826
last time, you called me in a panic
'cause you thought she'd cut her forehead,

07:31.909 --> 07:34.078
but you'd just dribbled
Arby's sauce on her.

07:35.746 --> 07:38.624
-It wasn't a very happy day for me either.
-[Peyton moans]

07:38.708 --> 07:40.585
Last bite of that sandwich was really dry.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.884
[Colt] Hey, man. What's up?

07:48.551 --> 07:52.180
Well, I got it running,
but now the rack and pinion's shot.

07:52.763 --> 07:54.432
Alright. So it won't turn.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.601
Just like my car in college.

07:56.934 --> 08:00.730
Lucky for me, though, we had a bar
and a DQ a straight shot from my dorm.

08:01.189 --> 08:03.691
Although it was tough
when you picked up a girl at the bar.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.693
You had to hope she lived on Elm.

08:07.028 --> 08:09.030
Or was down to hook up in the DQ.

08:10.990 --> 08:14.076
Yeah, well, it's gonna be a day or two
before we can use it.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.287
Although, this might be crazy, but...

08:16.370 --> 08:19.457
I think the DQ in Curranville
might be a straight shot from here.

08:20.333 --> 08:21.167
[beeping]

08:22.460 --> 08:23.461
Oh, shit.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.004

08:25.421 --> 08:26.255
[sighs]

08:26.339 --> 08:28.508
-What's that thing?
-A temperature gun.

08:29.759 --> 08:32.053
Yep, still at 99.7.

08:32.553 --> 08:36.140
Hey, fun fact. A worm is
the exact same temperature as my balls.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.059
Hey, Colt.

08:38.559 --> 08:39.393
Rich.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.062
What you doin' here?

08:42.104 --> 08:44.565
You see that bad Yelp review
about Neumann's Hill?

08:44.857 --> 08:47.944
You gonna have to take that up
with Bolt Cennett, whoever that is.

08:49.028 --> 08:50.696
Actually, I got let go.

08:51.405 --> 08:52.365
But it's fine.

08:52.573 --> 08:55.910
I have a degree from Texas A&amp;M
and over seven years of experience.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.787
And my replacement dropped out
of high school

08:57.870 --> 08:59.705
and knocked up Lisa Neumann's niece.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.334
Wow. His way sounds a lot easier.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.128
Luke Matthews, nice to meet you.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.632
Hey, if you're looking for a job,
we're taking on unpaid interns.

09:10.132 --> 09:13.553
I've been here a few months. I love it.
I'm down about $40,000.

09:13.636 --> 09:14.679
[chuckles]

09:15.054 --> 09:16.889
I appreciate the offer, but...

09:17.390 --> 09:19.016
I'm a buyer for Outback now.

09:20.309 --> 09:22.019
I'm interested in buying cows from you.

09:24.021 --> 09:24.897
Seriously?

09:24.981 --> 09:26.023
[dog barks in distance]

09:26.274 --> 09:29.193
-Oh, man, that'd be huge.
-We don't have to hug, Colt!

09:29.360 --> 09:31.404
Yeah, we don't have to but we will.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.991
-Buddy boy!
-[chuckles]

09:35.241 --> 09:37.868
Alright, my boss,
he's got a bid from Neumann's Hill.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.079
But, I showed him your Crowd Cow thing,

09:40.288 --> 09:42.415
and he loved the idea
of goin' independent.

09:43.124 --> 09:44.542
He also loved your slogan.

09:45.042 --> 09:46.419
"Let us put our beef...

09:46.711 --> 09:47.962
in yer buns!"

09:50.172 --> 09:51.507
I need 400 head by next fall.

09:51.591 --> 09:54.302
They'll not pay top dollar
but wanna lock in the price now.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.053
You got a fucking deal.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.972
This ranching's awesome!

09:58.055 --> 10:00.641
Four... Four hundred head. That's...

10:01.350 --> 10:02.560
[scoffs] Well, I mean...

10:02.893 --> 10:06.105
We'd love to do somethin'
but our herd ain't that big.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.315
We can probably do a hundred.

10:07.398 --> 10:09.734
Yeah... we wanted to do it
all in one shot.

10:10.860 --> 10:12.486
I was in the area and thought I'd ask.

10:12.612 --> 10:13.821
[Colt] Yeah.

10:14.655 --> 10:15.948
You know, hold on. I...

10:17.033 --> 10:20.161
When I was playing quarterback
for the Sioux City Bandits,

10:20.661 --> 10:23.205
our center was getting married.
"Tiny" Tim Cortez.

10:23.289 --> 10:24.415
Huge guy.

10:24.498 --> 10:25.458
Tiny pecker.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.711
We were throwin' him
a bachelor party, right?

10:28.794 --> 10:31.380
We couldn't afford a stripper,
so the whole team threw in.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.758
And I know 75 bucks don't seem like much,

10:33.966 --> 10:36.844
but in Sioux City, Iowa,
that gets you a homecoming queen.

10:37.094 --> 10:40.222
I mean, 1973 homecoming queen,
but still...

10:41.432 --> 10:44.393
And... And that is why
you should buy from us.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.855
What if we did the same thing
with the cows?

10:48.314 --> 10:51.400
There's a lot of great independent
ranchers around this town.

10:51.609 --> 10:54.945
Why don't we all throw in
and we do 400 head under one contract?

10:57.031 --> 10:57.990
That works for us.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.618
[sniggers] We're doing a deal
with Outback.

11:00.785 --> 11:03.079
Alright. Say it with me, Rich.

11:03.537 --> 11:05.748
[Aussie accent]
Outback: Australian for beef.

11:07.291 --> 11:08.125
That's Foster's.

11:09.543 --> 11:10.378
So...

11:11.879 --> 11:12.797
Now I just want a beer.

11:15.758 --> 11:16.926
[crickets chirping]

11:17.218 --> 11:18.969
[sniffs] Listen, Mr. Hollister,

11:19.720 --> 11:21.389
we're talkin' about Outback here.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.974
It's like the Red Lobster of Australia.

11:27.311 --> 11:31.273
Okay? We ain't never been able to get in
with a premium buyer like that before.

11:31.440 --> 11:32.775
And the best part of the deal

11:32.858 --> 11:34.860
is that we're taking it away
from Neumann's Hill.

11:35.152 --> 11:35.986
Yeah.

11:36.070 --> 11:38.155
And we already got the Kincaids
and the Hendersons.

11:38.280 --> 11:40.616
[together] Oh, fuck the Hendersons!

11:42.118 --> 11:44.537
I don't even know what they did,
but I love that.

11:46.539 --> 11:48.040
This all sounds great, Colt.

11:48.207 --> 11:49.834
-I'm in.
-Fuck, yeah!

11:51.460 --> 11:54.088
Mr. Hollister, I really appreciate
you putting aside

11:54.171 --> 11:56.507
what happened between me
and your daughter to do this.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.097
What happened between you
and my daughter?

12:05.850 --> 12:07.560
Not a goddamn thing.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.148
Luke, what do you say we celebrate
with a toast?

12:12.398 --> 12:13.733
Actually, I don't drink.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.819
Well, okay.
I suppose we'll have beer then.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.532
-[Beau] Hey, Roger.
-Hey, Beau!

12:21.741 --> 12:22.700
[Beau] What's goin' on?

12:23.367 --> 12:26.746
Oh, no. Your boy Mike get stuck
in our well again?

12:27.705 --> 12:28.539
No.

12:28.622 --> 12:29.540
[chuckles]

12:29.999 --> 12:31.751
Well, I'll check when I go.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.964
I was just finishin' up
some business here with the boys.

12:37.298 --> 12:38.174
How you been?

12:38.549 --> 12:39.592
How's Maggie?

12:40.050 --> 12:41.469
Actually, we're divorced.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.304
I got remarried.

12:43.804 --> 12:44.638
How's Cheryl?

12:44.722 --> 12:46.891
She passed away seven years ago.

12:47.183 --> 12:48.392
I'm sorry to hear that.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.770
Well, good catching up.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.062
Yep. You too.

12:52.938 --> 12:53.898
Take care.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.984
[shouting] Mike, you out here?

13:00.237 --> 13:02.323
What kinda deal you doin' with Hollister?

13:05.034 --> 13:07.369
Teaming up with the Hendersons,
the Kincaids.

13:07.953 --> 13:10.080
We're all gonna sell some cows to Outback.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.667
You gotta be careful
what you gettin' into.

13:13.751 --> 13:14.877
Ah, here we go.

13:15.252 --> 13:17.338
It's a bad idea 'cause I came up with it.

13:17.713 --> 13:21.175
No, 'cause a lot of things can go wrong
you might not have thought of.

13:21.425 --> 13:22.468
Like what?

13:22.551 --> 13:25.179
Like when Hollister thinks his cows
are worth more.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.890
Or Kincaid shows up ten heads short.

13:28.432 --> 13:31.310
Or the fuckin' Hendersons
act like the fuckin' Hendersons.

13:36.732 --> 13:37.983
There you are again.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.821
Offering up your opinion
when I never asked for it.

13:44.073 --> 13:46.158
[clears throat] Look, whatever happens,

13:47.117 --> 13:48.244
we'll figure it out.

13:49.119 --> 13:49.954
[Beau] Fine.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.706
Do whatever the fuck you want.
Good luck.

13:59.004 --> 14:00.339
[Joanne] I been lookin' for you.

14:00.589 --> 14:02.132
I did my best to lure you out.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.593
I made fish and I put on Rachel Maddow.

14:06.053 --> 14:07.012
What are you doin'?

14:08.138 --> 14:10.975
Well, since I'm not a rancher anymore,
I'm...

14:11.642 --> 14:13.602
getting rid of all this useless crap.

14:15.145 --> 14:17.523
Should I check the bottom of the pile
for Colt?

14:20.985 --> 14:23.112
How you doin'?
This must be very hard for you.

14:24.238 --> 14:26.699
[Beau] Lisa was already
in charge of my cattle.

14:28.075 --> 14:29.660
I'm 73 years old.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.621
I was gonna have to figure out...

14:33.873 --> 14:35.749
how to stop sometime, anyway.

14:37.418 --> 14:39.295
Would this have been my first choice?

14:39.503 --> 14:40.337
No.

14:41.422 --> 14:42.673
But it is what it is.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.553
Would you like a manure spreader?

14:49.513 --> 14:52.892
Wow! You really know your way
to a woman's heart. But, no, thanks.

14:55.769 --> 14:56.604
Hey!

14:57.313 --> 15:00.357
You're not really throwing away
the Iron River brand, are you?

15:01.775 --> 15:03.903
This is just a fuckin' piece of iron now.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.823
I worked this land my whole life.

15:08.949 --> 15:09.909
So did my dad.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.535
And his dad.

15:12.119 --> 15:12.953
For what?

15:13.454 --> 15:15.873
So I can sell to a fuckin' corporation,

15:16.123 --> 15:18.083
for a kid that doesn't give a shit?

15:19.126 --> 15:21.503
If you're trying to tell me
that brand means nothing to you,

15:21.587 --> 15:23.756
maybe I need that manure spreader
after all.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.386
Maybe I was wrong to sell.

15:30.554 --> 15:32.723
Maybe I shoulda just left him in jail.

15:33.265 --> 15:35.893
You ran a ranch for 50 years.

15:36.268 --> 15:39.021
Sacrificing that for your son
doesn't mean you made a mistake,

15:39.104 --> 15:40.397
it makes you a good father.

15:40.564 --> 15:41.649
Does it, Joanne?

15:42.733 --> 15:43.776
Or is a good father

15:43.859 --> 15:47.404
one that makes his kid suffer
the consequences for his actions?

15:47.488 --> 15:50.574
Well, that's easy to say,
but he's the only son you have left.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.493
But when does it end?

15:52.826 --> 15:54.954
I mean, he's been this way his whole life.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.040
When he was, like, eight,

15:58.749 --> 16:01.669
I took him to this stupid pizza joint.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.381
They had all these games and characters.

16:05.881 --> 16:09.134
He kept trying
to pull the pants off a mascot.

16:12.888 --> 16:16.016
I shoulda let that giant rat
kick the shit outta him.

16:19.019 --> 16:21.730
Look, he doesn't always do
the smartest thing.

16:22.231 --> 16:23.899
But he's fighting for what he believes in.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.651
Something you used to believe in.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.903
He's trying to keep
this way of life alive.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.406
Don't tell me you think he coulda won.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.950
[scoffs] I have no idea
but neither do you.

16:33.575 --> 16:37.037
I mean, nobody thought he could make
the Peterson place work.

16:37.121 --> 16:37.955
He has no money.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.040
He got hit by a wildfire.

16:40.541 --> 16:43.585
He didn't sell his herd and yet...
he's still standing.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.170
Yeah, until he fucks up again.

16:45.462 --> 16:47.172
Ah! Jesus! Beau!

16:47.756 --> 16:50.759
He just got three ranchers
to believe in him. Why can't you?

16:51.385 --> 16:53.470
Hey, is that my Keurig in the trash?

16:59.727 --> 17:01.687
Uh-oh, that is not good.

17:01.770 --> 17:05.399
Someone's running real hot.
I gotta get you in an ice bath ASAP.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.485
This thing's not a toy.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.070
[Luke] Yeah, well,

17:10.154 --> 17:11.947
neither was my ex-wife's fine china

17:12.031 --> 17:15.034
but it didn't stop me
from practicing skeet shootin' with it.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.705
Yeah, she's still at 99.7.

17:20.456 --> 17:22.374
Got a full belly and a clean diaper.

17:22.458 --> 17:27.004
The only thing left to do is order me
a "Father of the Year" beer koozie.

17:28.839 --> 17:29.923
What are you reading?

17:30.340 --> 17:32.134
Is that the first time
anyone's asked you that?

17:34.178 --> 17:35.888
It's me and Abby's divorce papers.

17:37.639 --> 17:40.684
I just keep lookin' 'em over,
I can't bring myself to sign them.

17:44.021 --> 17:45.397
Yeah, buddy, I get it.

17:46.106 --> 17:46.982
I mean...

17:47.733 --> 17:51.195
You're about to say goodbye to someone
who a big part of you still loves.

17:52.613 --> 17:53.906
I'm doing the same thing.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.325
Goodbye, friend.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.829
If you're not ready to sign,
you should talk to her.

18:01.455 --> 18:04.333
See if you can get back to
whatever made her fall in love with you.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.836
I'll start by growin' back
that old mullet.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.590
Well, maybe you're right. [sighs]

18:11.924 --> 18:14.593
I don't wanna give up.
I'll talk to her one more time.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.262
[Peyton starts crying]

18:17.679 --> 18:19.973
-What's the matter, Peyton?
-[Peyton screams]

18:20.140 --> 18:23.435
[baby voice] Yeah, don't worry.
Papa's not gonna grow a mullet.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.021
Though I would look glorious.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.816
-Wouldn't I?
-[cell phone rings]

18:28.899 --> 18:30.859
Oh. It's... Oh, shit, that's Hollister.

18:30.943 --> 18:31.777
[Peyton screams]

18:31.860 --> 18:33.695
-Here. You take her--
-Okay.

18:33.779 --> 18:36.073
-[Colt] Yeah, alright...
-Okay. Bye.

18:36.156 --> 18:37.366
[Peyton screams]

18:37.491 --> 18:38.951
-Hey, Mr. Hollister.
-[Luke] Wanna go

18:39.034 --> 18:40.869
-look at some stuff?
-[Peyton screams]

18:40.953 --> 18:43.455
-Hey. Hey, what's this?
-[screaming subsides]

18:43.747 --> 18:45.290
What's that? Is that a birdie?

18:45.457 --> 18:47.459
Huh! Is that a cloud?

18:47.918 --> 18:50.337
What's that silver thing?
Is it an airplane?

18:50.796 --> 18:52.548
Or like your Papa Beau would say,

18:52.798 --> 18:56.385
[deep voice] "A fucking government drone
come to take our freedom away"?

18:57.886 --> 19:00.639
[Colt] You gotta be kiddin' me.
What about the other ranchers?

19:02.516 --> 19:03.600
Unbelievable. I...

19:04.184 --> 19:05.978
Yeah, you have a good fuckin' night, too.

19:08.021 --> 19:09.064
What was that about?

19:11.525 --> 19:12.943
The other ranchers are out.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.779
We're gonna lose that Outback deal.

19:16.155 --> 19:17.197
What? Why?

19:17.823 --> 19:18.824
I don't... I..

19:18.949 --> 19:21.118
Apparently, Lisa Neumann found out
about the deal,

19:21.201 --> 19:23.287
made crazy big offers
for all their ranches.

19:23.370 --> 19:24.872
That's bullshit. We had a deal.

19:25.038 --> 19:26.415
Yeah, well, not anymore.

19:36.550 --> 19:37.759
[Luke] Oh, my God.

19:37.926 --> 19:40.637
-[Mary groans] Hey.
-What the fuck are you doing here?

19:41.180 --> 19:43.473
Err, I just need a place to stay.

19:43.640 --> 19:46.685
Ah. Maybe you should stay in the truck
you stole from me.

19:46.810 --> 19:49.146
[Mary] Shit.
I owe you an apology for that one.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.190
No, you... Hey, look at me.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.692
-You owe me a fucking truck for that.
-Okay.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.736
If I could turn heroin into a truck

19:55.819 --> 19:58.280
as easily as I turned a truck into heroin,
I would.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.701
[sighs] Listen, you gotta leave.
Just go. Okay.

20:02.784 --> 20:04.745
I need to get away
from the place I'm staying.

20:04.828 --> 20:06.371
Okay? I don't feel safe there.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.415
[snorts]

20:09.166 --> 20:11.084
I'm a fucking idiot 'cause...

20:11.627 --> 20:14.379
my instinct is to say,
"What's the matter? How can I help?"

20:14.463 --> 20:16.757
But know what?
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?

20:16.840 --> 20:19.635
-I've got... Let's see... 53 dollars.
-No. Come on.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.054
-There you go, take it.
-I don't want your money, okay?

20:22.137 --> 20:23.680
I just need a place to stay.

20:23.889 --> 20:26.141
-[Luke] Alright. Not my problem.
-Luke, I'm scared!

20:26.225 --> 20:27.643
Okay? I can't go back there.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.228
-Get the fuck out.
-[huffs]

20:29.353 --> 20:30.520
You're serious?

20:30.604 --> 20:33.065
Get your shit
and get the fuck outta here!

20:33.273 --> 20:35.192
-[Mary] Jesus!
-You screw me over four times.

20:35.275 --> 20:36.985
You think I'm gonna hang out
for a fifth?

20:37.069 --> 20:40.113
-Fuck! I don't need your fuckin' money.
-Oh, right.

20:40.364 --> 20:42.449
-Fuck you!
-You'll be back... Alright.

20:42.950 --> 20:43.909
[Mary] Fuck!

20:46.995 --> 20:48.997
-[crickets chirp]
-[cow moos]

20:51.333 --> 20:52.459
[car approaching]

20:52.709 --> 20:53.543
Hey.

20:54.586 --> 20:56.004
What are you doin'?

20:56.672 --> 20:59.883
Don't worry, it's safe.
I tested it out on a Thanksgiving turkey.

21:00.384 --> 21:03.178
Although when I put it down,
Drake dragged it into the woods.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.846
But he won't do that with Peyton.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.181
I think.

21:08.517 --> 21:10.477
I'm not worried about the swing, okay?

21:10.560 --> 21:13.188
-I'm worried about Peyton being sick.
-[Peyton cries]

21:13.272 --> 21:15.607
And you have her out here
in 40-degree weather.

21:15.691 --> 21:16.733
[Colt] Hey!

21:16.817 --> 21:19.236
-[Peyton cries]
-Hey, she likes it.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.238
She's all bundled up,

21:21.321 --> 21:23.198
-I got a hat on her.
-[Peyton screams]

21:23.282 --> 21:25.367
I took her temperature, it was only 99.7.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.494
That's only one degree
over the legal limit.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.706
You know what? I can't believe this.

21:30.789 --> 21:32.249
I know I shouldn't have left.

21:33.542 --> 21:34.376
Oh.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.795
Now I can't be alone with my daughter.

21:36.878 --> 21:39.256
You can't be alone with a fucking turkey.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.341
[sighs] Okay, you're right.

21:41.508 --> 21:44.052
I was wrong. I'm just a fuckin' idiot.

21:44.136 --> 21:46.221
-That's not what I'm saying.
-Yeah, it is.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.266
I'm not a good enough rancher for my dad,

21:49.349 --> 21:51.310
I'm not a good enough husband for you,

21:51.560 --> 21:53.228
I'm not a good enough father for Peyton.

21:53.312 --> 21:56.773
I just wish you would think about things
before you did 'em sometimes.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.483
[Colt] Yeah. Well...

21:58.567 --> 22:01.153
I think I've thought enough
about this, so...

22:01.278 --> 22:02.279
here you go.

22:03.196 --> 22:04.823
It's over. It's official.

22:10.912 --> 22:13.915
I know you're mad at me, but I'm not
the one who did this. You did.

22:14.207 --> 22:15.042
Well...

22:15.334 --> 22:16.585
I guess I got what I wanted.

22:17.169 --> 22:18.003
Yeah.

22:19.129 --> 22:20.672
-[Beau] Hey, Abby.
-Hey, Mr. Bennett.

22:20.756 --> 22:21.590
See you around.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.140
[car door shuts]
[engine starts]

22:33.268 --> 22:35.479
[car pulls away]

22:35.604 --> 22:37.731
-You all right?
-What do you want, Dad?

22:41.443 --> 22:43.487
Dale was over at Kincaid's this morning.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.198
He said your deal fell apart.

22:48.116 --> 22:50.369
[sighs] Yeah. So what... yeah--

22:50.452 --> 22:52.329
You wanna tell me, "I told you so"?

22:53.288 --> 22:57.417
Joanne says people don't enjoy
hearing that as much as I enjoy sayin' it.

23:03.840 --> 23:04.966
So, what's your plan?

23:10.138 --> 23:13.558
Probably drink a lot of water,
so I don't get dehydrated from cryin'.

23:15.102 --> 23:16.937
So you're just gonna give up
on the deal?

23:18.271 --> 23:19.147
Seriously?

23:21.149 --> 23:23.110
I'm just never good enough for you, am I?

23:23.902 --> 23:26.822
First, it's a stupid idea,
and now I'm giving up too soon.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.117
I never said it was a stupid idea.

23:31.159 --> 23:32.786
I said you had to be careful.

23:37.916 --> 23:40.043
You know what made you
a great quarterback?

23:42.337 --> 23:44.423
-My arm.
-God, no.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.261
When a play fell apart,

23:50.053 --> 23:51.346
you never gave up on it.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.557
The pocket could collapse,

23:54.516 --> 23:55.642
and you didn't panic.

23:57.936 --> 24:00.230
You always saw things others couldn't.

24:02.149 --> 24:04.401
And you'd make a great play
out of nothing.

24:08.697 --> 24:09.948
I mean, I had a good arm.

24:12.534 --> 24:13.368
Colt,

24:14.494 --> 24:18.165
I'm not gonna be able to tell you
what you want to hear about your arm.

24:22.043 --> 24:23.712
I probably never told you this enough,

24:23.795 --> 24:26.381
but nothing made me prouder
than watching you play.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.676
You never told me that.

24:30.385 --> 24:31.595
Well, I should have.

24:34.055 --> 24:35.390
And I'm sorry about that.

24:38.518 --> 24:39.936
You're not a quitter, Colt.

24:41.938 --> 24:43.190
You never quit on a play.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.151
You never quit on your career.

24:48.153 --> 24:50.405
And you never quit
on getting your own ranch.

24:51.323 --> 24:54.326
That's exactly what I was doin'
with Lisa Neumann till you stepped in.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.870
And I might've been wrong.

24:59.998 --> 25:01.249
But what's done is done.

25:03.418 --> 25:05.921
That deal you put together
with the other ranchers,

25:07.339 --> 25:08.423
it's a good plan.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.801
All the other ranchers are out, Dad.
It's over.

25:12.093 --> 25:15.430
And everyone said it was over
when you were five points down

25:15.805 --> 25:18.308
and had to drive your team 80 yards

25:18.808 --> 25:22.729
in less than a minute, with no time-outs,
to win the state championship.

25:24.231 --> 25:25.232
But you did it.

25:28.985 --> 25:30.278
Now, figure this out.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.156
And do it again.

25:48.046 --> 25:50.048
-[pool balls click]
-[people chatter]

25:50.215 --> 25:52.008
Oh well, at least they all showed up.

25:53.301 --> 25:57.138
Hey, that's the guy who stole your calf
and shot at us.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.392
Yeah, that's Toby Henderson.

26:00.475 --> 26:02.727
Fuck the Hendersons!

26:06.398 --> 26:08.149
Okay, now I get it.

26:10.443 --> 26:12.654
Toby's a shithead, man,
but you can't hold a grudge

26:12.737 --> 26:14.781
against everybody that shoots at you
in this town.

26:15.782 --> 26:16.616
Hey!

26:16.866 --> 26:18.660
How's it going? What's up, fellas?

26:19.119 --> 26:21.496
Look, I really appreciate
y'all comin' down.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.874
Look, we're sorry about this, Colt.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.627
Oh, no. Yeah, you ain't got nothin'
to be sorry about.

26:27.711 --> 26:30.463
I mean, Lisa Neumann's offering you
a great deal.

26:30.922 --> 26:32.549
But... I think the...

26:33.133 --> 26:34.718
the only question is...

26:35.719 --> 26:37.053
Why is she offering it?

26:37.345 --> 26:40.724
Wow! Now,
that's a thought-provoking question.

26:43.518 --> 26:45.312
Lisa only made them offers...

26:46.521 --> 26:47.606
'cause she's scared.

26:49.232 --> 26:50.233
She's afraid.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.403
'Cause if we can
take this deal away from her,

26:54.029 --> 26:55.447
we can take any deal away.

26:56.573 --> 26:58.950
Right. This doesn't have to be
a one-time thing.

26:59.242 --> 27:00.535
We could do other deals.

27:00.785 --> 27:03.121
You know, chicken nuggets are a big thing.

27:05.665 --> 27:07.083
Why not cow nuggets?

27:12.005 --> 27:14.507
Alone, we can't compete
with Neumann's Hill.

27:16.134 --> 27:17.469
But together, we can.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.597
This ain't just about
fightin' for ourselves,

27:20.680 --> 27:22.474
this is about fightin' for our town.

27:22.849 --> 27:25.352
They don't... buy their tractors here,

27:25.602 --> 27:28.647
they don't buy their feed here,
they hire their own vets.

27:29.397 --> 27:32.484
This is our time
to draw a line in the sand.

27:32.567 --> 27:36.237
-[Luke] Mm.
-This is our time to fight for our town.

27:46.706 --> 27:48.625
-I misread the room on that one.
-Yeah.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.421
Colt, I can't worry
about saving the whole town.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.840
I gotta worry about my family.

27:56.549 --> 27:58.635
And that money's gonna mean
a lot to them.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.888
[Mr. Kincaid] I'm barely hanging on
as it is.

28:02.472 --> 28:04.182
My baler went down this morning.

28:04.432 --> 28:07.477
Okay, alright.
Well, you can borrow our baler.

28:08.061 --> 28:12.273
Right? We don't just have to share deals,
we can share resources.

28:12.774 --> 28:16.152
Yeah, like if someone's tractor
only drove in a straight line,

28:16.444 --> 28:17.404
you know...

28:18.822 --> 28:20.782
you guys could loan 'em... yours.

28:23.034 --> 28:24.244
Yeah-- Look...

28:25.620 --> 28:27.831
If this is really about your family,

28:28.748 --> 28:30.583
why are you selling your family ranch?

28:32.585 --> 28:36.381
My great-grandfather passed down
Iron River to my grandfather,

28:36.923 --> 28:38.383
who passed it down to my dad.

28:38.842 --> 28:42.220
And when my football career was over,
I had a place to come home to.

28:42.387 --> 28:43.888
Then why'd your dad sell?

28:45.098 --> 28:46.307
He took the money.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.225
No.

28:47.600 --> 28:51.479
No, he cared more about losin' his son
than he did losin' his ranch.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.944
My dad only sold 'cause he didn't feel
like he had a choice.

28:59.863 --> 29:00.697
But we do.

29:02.782 --> 29:03.658
Look...

29:05.034 --> 29:07.120
we gotta save our family legacies here.

29:07.203 --> 29:11.040
Mr. Hollister, what's Mike and Kathy
gonna do if you sell your ranch?

29:11.291 --> 29:12.333
They gonna work at Walmart?

29:13.543 --> 29:14.502
Mr. Kincaid,

29:15.044 --> 29:16.379
what about Jack, Becky?

29:16.504 --> 29:19.883
You think they're gonna be happy living
in their little apartments in the city?

29:20.633 --> 29:22.719
Toby, what you gonna do
if your dad sells his ranch?

29:22.802 --> 29:25.597
I mean, even a shit rancher like you
deserves a chance.

29:27.849 --> 29:29.058
Fuck you, Colt!

29:30.685 --> 29:32.520
Fuck you, too!

29:35.565 --> 29:36.816
[customer talking loudly]

29:37.025 --> 29:38.318
What do you say, fellas?

29:44.699 --> 29:45.784
[door opens]

29:49.496 --> 29:50.330
[Colt] Hey.

29:51.915 --> 29:52.749
[Beau] Hey!

29:56.044 --> 29:57.712
I talked to all them guys again.

29:58.797 --> 29:59.672
How'd it go?

30:02.592 --> 30:03.718
They're all back in.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.262
No shit.

30:07.764 --> 30:08.598
[Colt] Yeah.

30:10.058 --> 30:12.644
It's like leading the team
down a football field again.

30:12.811 --> 30:13.645
[chuckles]

30:13.728 --> 30:17.023
Guess anything's possible
when you got a rocket launcher for an arm.

30:17.106 --> 30:17.941
[smooches]

30:19.275 --> 30:21.736
Don't make me drag out
all your game footage, son.

30:21.820 --> 30:22.904
[Colt laughs]

30:24.030 --> 30:25.240
Congratulations.

30:25.698 --> 30:26.533
[Colt] Yeah.

30:27.534 --> 30:28.451
Hey, I...

30:32.038 --> 30:33.248
I need to say thank you.

30:34.165 --> 30:35.458
[Beau] Don't thank me.

30:36.292 --> 30:39.879
I didn't do anything.
You're the one that made it happen.

30:40.463 --> 30:42.507
It's... not about tonight.

30:46.135 --> 30:47.846
It's about you sellin' Iron River.

30:52.183 --> 30:53.810
Think I understand why you did it.

30:56.896 --> 30:57.897
It wasn't 'cause...

30:59.440 --> 31:00.859
you don't have faith in me.

31:03.319 --> 31:05.154
It's 'cause you'd do anything to save me.

31:08.324 --> 31:09.701
You're my family, Colt.

31:11.911 --> 31:13.204
Peyton is my family.

31:15.123 --> 31:16.583
This is just a chunk of dirt.

31:16.666 --> 31:17.500
[Colt huffs]

31:18.543 --> 31:20.086
Both know it's more than that.

31:21.421 --> 31:22.255
It's...

31:23.131 --> 31:24.215
I got an idea.

31:25.049 --> 31:29.012
Jesus, Colt! I don't think I could survive
another one of your "ideas."

31:32.432 --> 31:33.266
[sighs]

31:34.017 --> 31:35.435
Found this in the trash.

31:37.270 --> 31:38.855
Along with a perfectly good Keurig.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.692
Yeah, well, I'm fresh outta cattle.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.738
I don't have a use for a brand anymore.

31:49.699 --> 31:51.576
Your granddad gave this to your dad.

31:53.745 --> 31:54.829
He gave it to you.

31:57.165 --> 31:58.374
I remember holdin' it

31:59.208 --> 32:00.251
when I was a kid...

32:02.754 --> 32:05.006
imaginin' someday I'd put it on my cattle.

32:06.257 --> 32:07.091
You know,

32:07.342 --> 32:10.762
Lisa Neumann can buy our property
but she can't take our legacy.

32:13.723 --> 32:14.557
I know...

32:15.850 --> 32:18.186
my cows don't have
the Iron River bloodline.

32:21.397 --> 32:22.273
But I do.

32:25.068 --> 32:25.902
So, I was...

32:27.695 --> 32:29.113
hopin' you'd be okay if...

32:30.531 --> 32:32.492
I put the Iron River name on my cattle.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.455
I'd like that.

32:39.415 --> 32:40.291
Thank you.

32:44.754 --> 32:45.838
Love you, Dad.

32:46.464 --> 32:47.882
I love you too, Son.

32:50.093 --> 32:50.927
[Colt snorts]

32:52.178 --> 32:53.346
[chuckles]

32:53.930 --> 32:57.392
You know, if this was a movie,
we'd probably hug right now.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.020
Yeah, probably would.

33:06.693 --> 33:09.988
You love me more
than the Iron River Ranch.

33:12.115 --> 33:13.282
We're not huggin'.

33:15.076 --> 33:16.327
[Colt] Dammit.
