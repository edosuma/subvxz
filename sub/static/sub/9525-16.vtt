07:48.491 --> 07:52.894
Do you know if this is imitation crab?

07:52.929 --> 07:54.463
Oh! That was close, man.

07:54.497 --> 07:57.366
Come on, let's go.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.500
Hey, stop!

07:58.535 --> 08:01.036
They got salad in their pants.

08:01.070 --> 08:02.705
- They're stealing salad again.
- [Bleep].

08:02.739 --> 08:04.440
- All: Go, go, go!
- Come on, guys!

08:04.474 --> 08:08.310
- Ugh!
- Get back here!

08:08.345 --> 08:09.545
Oh!

08:09.579 --> 08:11.547
Oh, no, no! He's hurt!

08:11.581 --> 08:13.515
I've never seen an old dude cry before.

08:13.550 --> 08:14.916
That turd is the enemy!

08:14.951 --> 08:16.184
Let's get out of here! Come on!

08:16.219 --> 08:18.320
Cave dwellers! We are the 100%!

08:18.355 --> 08:20.856
Let's go!

08:25.503 --> 08:27.537
[sniffs, trills tongue]

08:27.572 --> 08:28.971
[Gags] [All snorting]

08:29.006 --> 08:31.274
- Oh!
- Oh-ho-ho!

08:31.309 --> 08:33.476
So this dude comes up to me
with this stupid idea, right?

08:33.510 --> 08:35.445
Mint flavored condoms... "condomints."

08:35.479 --> 08:38.114
So I'm like, "yeah, man,
let's manufacture that."

08:38.148 --> 08:41.318
Two months later, we're making
four mil dollars, netted, right?

08:41.352 --> 08:43.086
How lord is that?

08:43.120 --> 08:45.322
<i>- Oh, lord have mercy.
- That's so Lord of the Rings.</i>

08:45.356 --> 08:46.789
<i>Lord of the Flies. Lord of... yeah.</i>

08:46.824 --> 08:48.225
We got some, uh, stupid ideas.

08:48.259 --> 08:49.959
We could throw 'em at you if you want.

08:49.993 --> 08:51.595
Yeah, yeah, go ahead and
hit me with 'em, right?

08:51.629 --> 08:52.929
Make sure it's a big, fat moneymaker, okay?

08:52.963 --> 08:54.264
'Cause... make it like a big, juicy grape.

08:54.298 --> 08:56.099
'Cause I f-ing love grapes.

08:56.133 --> 08:57.800
Grapes, we love grapes.

08:57.835 --> 08:59.035
We got red ones, green ones.

08:59.069 --> 09:00.437
- We got seedless.
- Hey, we're grapenuts.

09:00.471 --> 09:01.971
We're grape-nuts!

09:02.005 --> 09:03.406
Okay, seriously,

09:03.441 --> 09:05.975
here's an idea, a big, juicy grape idea.

09:06.009 --> 09:07.944
A hot dog bun

09:07.978 --> 09:10.179
in the shape of one of those rubber armpits

09:10.214 --> 09:11.281
from crutches, right?

09:11.315 --> 09:12.382
Traps all the condiments.

09:12.416 --> 09:13.383
That's a juicy grape, right?

09:13.417 --> 09:14.384
That's not a grape.

09:14.418 --> 09:15.485
That is a raisin.

09:15.519 --> 09:16.720
Massages, right? Massages.

09:16.754 --> 09:18.221
- You love a massage, right?
- Right.

09:18.256 --> 09:19.356
What you can't get is a back scratch.

09:19.390 --> 09:20.357
And we all love a back scratch!

09:20.391 --> 09:21.625
Oh, that feels so good!

09:21.659 --> 09:24.160
- Still a raisin.
- Uh, frontpack!

09:24.194 --> 09:26.663
It's a... backpack for your front.

09:26.697 --> 09:27.964
Raisin.

09:27.998 --> 09:29.332
Chapstick, for straight men, though.

09:29.367 --> 09:31.100
A whole big box of raisins, boys.

09:31.135 --> 09:33.002
It's been nice face-timing, but I got to go.

09:33.036 --> 09:35.872
This thai chick says she
wants to suck on my ass.

09:35.906 --> 09:37.307
That sounds awesome.
That sounds really good.

09:37.341 --> 09:39.942
- Yeah, do something.
- Uh...

09:39.977 --> 09:42.011
What about an unburnable American flag?

09:42.045 --> 09:43.246
What?

09:43.281 --> 09:46.416
Now, that's...

09:46.450 --> 09:49.118
that's a grape.

09:49.443 --> 09:52.111
- Mmm. Mmm.
- Oh, yeah.

09:52.145 --> 09:54.413
This is the best salad I've ever had, man.

09:54.448 --> 09:55.782
Shame, Homey,

09:55.816 --> 09:57.283
you have got to try
some of these garbanzos.

09:57.317 --> 09:58.317
They are the truth.

09:58.351 --> 09:59.986
Never touch me!

10:00.020 --> 10:01.988
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, sir.

10:02.022 --> 10:03.623
I'm also very sorry about the potato salad.

10:03.657 --> 10:05.692
I look forward to giving
you a private apology,

10:05.726 --> 10:08.127
but, please, right now
consider this my public apology.

10:08.161 --> 10:09.228
Is it accepted, sir?

10:09.262 --> 10:11.197
Negative. Okay?

10:11.231 --> 10:14.734
We need to plan our next move.

10:14.768 --> 10:18.370
Fruit and salad was just
the first course, okay?

10:18.405 --> 10:21.173
Now we need to pick our
victims for operation chaos.

10:21.208 --> 10:22.976
I don't know what that
is, but I'm in, Shame.

10:23.010 --> 10:24.677
We've been saving our pee-pee in jars

10:24.712 --> 10:26.112
for quite some time now.

10:26.146 --> 10:27.714
We're just waiting for the right target

10:27.748 --> 10:29.148
to strike, baby.

10:29.182 --> 10:31.283
It's gonna be sweet.

10:31.318 --> 10:33.452
Dude, what about that club
I was at tonight... La Vida?

10:33.487 --> 10:36.422
That place is full of
rich, stupid wanksters.

10:36.456 --> 10:37.957
That's perfect.

10:37.992 --> 10:39.525
Okay, we tap into the building's water line

10:39.559 --> 10:41.293
and we set off the fire alarm.

10:41.328 --> 10:44.130
We turn those sprinklers into tinklers.

10:44.164 --> 10:45.531
[Laughs] Get it?

10:45.565 --> 10:47.299
Why can't you be more like him?

10:47.334 --> 10:49.301
He's been here for one day,
and he came up with that.

10:49.336 --> 10:52.105
Yes, sir. I'm sorry,
sir. I will try harder.

10:52.139 --> 10:53.806
Also, please let me know
when a good time would be

10:53.841 --> 10:55.207
for my private apology.

10:55.242 --> 10:59.879
I still would like to give that to you.

11:02.850 --> 11:04.416
Blake! Oh, my God, dude!

11:04.451 --> 11:07.453
We had such a good night,
man. We lorded so hard.

11:07.487 --> 11:09.922
Lord force one is landing.

11:09.957 --> 11:11.724
Very cool, man.

11:11.759 --> 11:13.159
Yeah, dude, I had a ton of fun tonight too.

11:13.193 --> 11:14.694
I went out with the street-art collective,

11:14.728 --> 11:17.163
and, dude, we looted this grocery store.

11:17.197 --> 11:19.565
We totally jacked up
this old security guard.

11:19.599 --> 11:21.467
We had fun too. We did a bunch of cocaine.

11:21.501 --> 11:23.269
And then I think we sold an idea to trick.

11:23.303 --> 11:24.503
Yes, we did!

11:24.538 --> 11:25.905
And he gave us a little doggie bag.

11:25.939 --> 11:27.439
A little ba-ba-ba-ba...

11:27.474 --> 11:28.407
Hey, where's the unburnable flag?

11:28.441 --> 11:30.009
- Right?
- We need it.

11:30.044 --> 11:31.711
Trick says it's, like, a big, juicy grape.

11:31.745 --> 11:33.646
- Yeah.
- Wait. You pitched my idea?

11:33.681 --> 11:36.015
No, we pitched him our idea.

11:36.050 --> 11:37.550
You may have had the initial thought,

11:37.584 --> 11:39.085
but we fleshed it out and made it sexy.

11:39.119 --> 11:40.419
We made it hip. We made it cool.

11:40.453 --> 11:41.453
We made it fun. We made it different.

11:41.488 --> 11:43.056
We made it bounce.

11:43.090 --> 11:44.356
Now we're gonna be lords, living in condos.

11:44.391 --> 11:45.725
Money's gonna be working for us,

11:45.759 --> 11:47.168
we're not gonna be working
for money. Where's the flag?

11:47.169 --> 11:47.876
No, no, no, no, no.

11:47.877 --> 11:50.716
That flag is for the people.
It's not to be commercialized.

11:50.801 --> 11:52.268
Look, I don't know if you guys can tell,

11:52.302 --> 11:55.171
but I'm kind of a hairy artist, all right?

11:55.205 --> 11:56.673
I'm not a bald sellout.

11:56.707 --> 11:57.874
Okay, so are the shots fired? Am I balding?

11:57.908 --> 11:59.442
- No.
- Is there a spot?

11:59.476 --> 12:00.743
- Look, there's no spot.
- Do you see the spot?

12:00.778 --> 12:02.311
Blake, would you just stop playing

12:02.345 --> 12:03.546
<i>Assassin's Creed III for one second</i>

12:03.581 --> 12:04.647
and tell us where the flag is?

12:04.682 --> 12:06.248
Or...

12:06.283 --> 12:08.417
[Razor buzzes] I'm gonna cut your hair off.

12:08.452 --> 12:10.186
Hey, don't joke about that, all right?

12:10.220 --> 12:11.287
We're not joking.

12:11.321 --> 12:12.488
We're being real right now.

12:12.522 --> 12:15.157
I was playing... that's it.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.460
I'm going in my room. You
guys are acting stupid.

12:17.494 --> 12:18.895
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am!

12:18.929 --> 12:21.163
[Overlapping shouting]

12:21.198 --> 12:22.465
[Razor buzzing]

12:22.499 --> 12:23.800
This isn't you, Ders, all right?

12:23.834 --> 12:25.034
It's the cocaine.

12:25.069 --> 12:26.603
It doesn't have to be this way!

12:26.637 --> 12:27.704
No! No! Come on, man!

12:27.738 --> 12:28.805
I look so stupid without it!

12:28.839 --> 12:31.741
No! Bye bye, goldilocks!

12:31.775 --> 12:33.375
[Both laugh] Ah!

12:33.410 --> 12:35.478
Take your hands off his hair!

12:35.512 --> 12:37.580
[Buzzing stops] Or what?

12:37.615 --> 12:39.415
I'm gonna cross every autograph off

12:39.449 --> 12:41.117
of your prized swim ball, Ders,

12:41.151 --> 12:43.753
starting with Allison Schmitt.

12:43.787 --> 12:45.822
Who's Allison Schmitt? What?

12:45.856 --> 12:48.457
She was, like, a huge
olympic swimmer, the last one.

12:48.492 --> 12:50.760
I saw the entire women's team at a Perkins,

12:50.794 --> 12:52.695
and all I had was a
B-ball for them to sign.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.263
Guys, shut up!

12:54.297 --> 12:56.532
Okay, cross that off, Karl.

12:56.566 --> 12:58.034
With pleasure, sir.

12:58.068 --> 12:59.235
All right, all right!

12:59.269 --> 13:00.236
Don't do it, man, please.

13:00.270 --> 13:01.537
He's with us now.

13:01.611 --> 13:03.112
- Ow.
- Thanks, bro.

13:03.147 --> 13:04.446
Thanks, Shame, I really appreciate it.

13:04.481 --> 13:05.614
Come on, guys. Let's get out of here.

13:05.649 --> 13:07.950
- He's with us.
- Fine!

13:07.985 --> 13:10.553
We can make our own
American unburnable flag

13:10.587 --> 13:13.189
that's also an American one.

13:13.223 --> 13:15.992
All right, this ought to make it fireproof.

13:16.026 --> 13:18.027
- Mm-hmm.
- Give her a shot.

13:18.062 --> 13:20.129
- Oh, yep.
- On our way to millions, buddy.

13:20.164 --> 13:22.098
[Stove clicks]

13:22.132 --> 13:23.399
Nope. Why is that happening?

13:23.433 --> 13:24.567
It didn't work, did it?

13:24.601 --> 13:26.035
Yeah, should not have happened.

13:26.070 --> 13:27.670
- Why is it so hard?
- Because I'm exhausted.

13:27.705 --> 13:29.105
We were out all night,

13:29.139 --> 13:31.540
and now this morning my brain's broken.

13:31.575 --> 13:33.509
Well, you know what helps with that?

13:33.543 --> 13:35.611
[Snorts]

13:35.645 --> 13:37.814
I got it.

13:37.848 --> 13:39.182
We need bigger flags.

13:39.216 --> 13:41.918
Whoo!

13:41.952 --> 13:44.453
Okay, all we got to do is lace
this sucker with some borax.

13:44.487 --> 13:46.155
Wet, wet, wet...

13:46.190 --> 13:47.223
- It isn't gonna burn, man.
- You ain't gonna burn.

13:47.257 --> 13:49.926
- Okay! All right!
- Whoa!

13:49.960 --> 13:50.927
[Screaming]

13:50.961 --> 13:52.361
[Snorting]

13:52.395 --> 13:54.363
Oh!

13:54.397 --> 13:56.532
Yeah, baby! Yeah, mama!

13:56.566 --> 13:58.234
Oh, that's not burning.

13:58.268 --> 14:00.103
Here we go. It really caught.

14:00.137 --> 14:01.137
- Wow!
- Jesus!

14:01.171 --> 14:03.139
[Snorts]

14:03.173 --> 14:04.974
[Screams]

14:05.008 --> 14:06.408
- You know what?
- What?

14:06.443 --> 14:07.910
- We're not thinking good.
- I know.

14:07.945 --> 14:09.045
Right? You know what helps us think good?

14:09.079 --> 14:11.313
- No.
- Both: Cocaine, yeah.

14:11.348 --> 14:13.616
Oh! I feel smarter, dude.

14:13.650 --> 14:15.952
- That was a good idea.
- That was a smart idea.

14:15.986 --> 14:18.020
Your nose is bleeding. Is it?

14:18.055 --> 14:19.989
- It's coming down out of there.
- Wow.

14:20.023 --> 14:21.557
Yours is too! No, it isn't.

14:21.591 --> 14:22.825
- Oh, my God, it is. It is.
- Yours is bleeding.

14:22.860 --> 14:24.127
What are you doing? [Screams]

14:24.161 --> 14:25.461
This might be the special ingredient...

14:25.495 --> 14:26.896
a little blood of the patriots.

14:26.930 --> 14:28.197
- Are you kidding me?
- What a smart idea.

14:28.232 --> 14:29.999
Patriots blood on this.

14:30.033 --> 14:31.234
- Whoa!
- It's not gonna burn.

14:31.268 --> 14:33.069
Both: It's burning!

14:33.103 --> 14:34.971
- It's burning more than ever.
- Why are you burning?

14:35.005 --> 14:36.172
Come on!

14:36.206 --> 14:37.974
Wow, okay, that didn't work.

14:38.008 --> 14:39.075
That did not work at all.

14:39.109 --> 14:41.144
What's up? Hey, bro!

14:41.178 --> 14:43.980
Black people of all shapes and
ages love to be called "bro."

14:44.014 --> 14:45.915
- Don't they?
- Yeah, they do.

14:50.449 --> 14:52.684
Okay, I don't feel we need the flag,

14:52.718 --> 14:56.188
because our theme song is
"fugging" incredible, okay?

14:56.222 --> 14:58.924
Let's practice. One, two, three, four...

14:58.958 --> 15:00.292
Both: * unburnable flag *

15:00.326 --> 15:01.726

15:06.933 --> 15:09.201
Hey, nizzles be tanned.

15:09.235 --> 15:11.036
- We are, yes.
- It's tan-amazing.

15:54.113 --> 15:55.780
That's my boy, Armand, right there.

15:55.815 --> 15:57.115
He's got for-real cheddar.

15:57.150 --> 15:58.616
He's gonna be perfect for this, okay?

15:58.651 --> 16:00.853
Cool, cool. Thanks, man.

16:00.887 --> 16:02.721
[Laughs] This is great.

16:02.755 --> 16:04.923

about the other night, right?

16:04.958 --> 16:06.491
I mean, we respect your hair, totally.

I love it. It's good. It's a good look.

like this place, man.

I am looking at the switch now.

17:13.358 --> 17:16.929
But, um, are we sure we want to do this?

17:16.963 --> 17:19.131
Are we sure we want to
hold up a mirror to society

17:19.165 --> 17:20.332
and piss on that mirror?

17:20.366 --> 17:22.434
- I am!
- I know. I know.

It's just that, that urine
was, like, sunchip yellow, man.

in here are my friends.

They're not your friends, okay?

They're small-minded cave dwellers

that need to be sledgehammered
in the face with reality.

and the outs, science-wise.

into a total wankster...

I mean, we knew he could be
a wankster to other people,

18:48.843 --> 18:50.844
but I didn't know he could
be such a wankster to us,

18:50.879 --> 18:52.412
