00:07.608 --> 00:10.275
Where is he?
What do you want
from Joel Graves,

00:10.277 --> 00:12.311
Stan?
I want him in here.

00:12.313 --> 00:14.230
You know what I think
you really want?

00:14.231 --> 00:16.148
What you really want, you know
he can't give it to you.

00:16.150 --> 00:17.783
You've got ten seconds.
This isn't the way, Stan.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.018
Nine!
It's not the way!

00:19.020 --> 00:21.220
Your friends know that.
Eight...

00:21.222 --> 00:22.588
Your friends know
when it's time to stop.

00:22.590 --> 00:24.790
You get him in here.

00:24.792 --> 00:26.425
Or this ends right now.

00:26.427 --> 00:28.193
Just don't do it, Stan.

00:28.195 --> 00:30.162
Just don't do it.

00:30.164 --> 00:32.531
No!

00:35.536 --> 00:37.069
JULES:
Okay, explain this to me.

00:37.071 --> 00:38.737
Flowers in a hospital.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.522
Wow, thanks so much.

00:40.523 --> 00:42.306
They're so pretty.
Now, you get to leave and I get

00:42.309 --> 00:44.209
to sit here and
watch them die.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.112
It's a gesture.

00:47.114 --> 00:49.515
It's the thought.
Huh.

00:49.517 --> 00:51.650
Short-term thought.

00:51.652 --> 00:53.318
That's why I got
you the plant.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.154
I'm thinking long term.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.056
Yeah, how long you thinking?

00:57.058 --> 01:00.059
As long as it takes,
I'll be here.

01:00.061 --> 01:03.095
Well, I don't plan on staying
here for very long.

01:03.097 --> 01:04.229
Good.

01:04.231 --> 01:05.464
That's good.
We're missing you bad.

01:05.466 --> 01:07.366
Oh, yeah? How bad?

01:07.368 --> 01:09.568
Really bad.
Yeah?

01:09.570 --> 01:12.371
Not so bad that
the team's not looking

01:12.373 --> 01:14.339
for somebody to fill my spot.

01:14.341 --> 01:17.076
Final round of recruiting
is today.

01:17.078 --> 01:18.844
Anybody good?

01:18.846 --> 01:20.479
They're down to six.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.147
(whistles):
From?

01:22.149 --> 01:24.583
From 300, so yeah,
they're good.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.351
(tongue clicks)

01:26.353 --> 01:27.820
(guns firing)

01:34.628 --> 01:36.762
.308 round
projectile traveling

01:36.764 --> 01:39.264
at 2,750 feet per second.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.433
Projectile weighs 168 grains.

01:41.435 --> 01:42.851
Eyes on the target!

01:42.852 --> 01:44.268
The gun is zeroed
at 100 yards.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.705
Standard atmospheric
conditions at sea level.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.209
What's the drop at 200 yards?

01:50.211 --> 01:53.178
Drop at 200 yards,
3.8 inches.

01:53.180 --> 01:54.513
Double the weight
of the projectile.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.548
What's the drop?
3.8 inches.

01:56.550 --> 01:57.783
The drop is constant.

02:00.154 --> 02:01.787
Donna Sabine, you looking

02:01.789 --> 02:03.355
for a change
in scenery or what?

02:03.357 --> 02:04.690
Change of wardrobe.

02:04.692 --> 02:07.860
Trying to get into cool
pants a long time.

02:07.862 --> 02:09.294
Nice to meet you, Donna.

02:09.296 --> 02:10.562
Nice to meet you, sir.

02:15.469 --> 02:19.271
I'm not spying.
Yeah, he's taking digital
pictures with a zoom lens.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.906
Personally, if I got
a gun to my neck,

02:20.908 --> 02:22.641
your promise comes
from your heart.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.775
Right? Right.

02:23.777 --> 02:25.711
So you see where
I'm going with this?

02:25.713 --> 02:28.147
You gotta put the gun down
so he can think straight.

02:28.883 --> 02:30.549
Right down.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.485
Nice.

02:38.459 --> 02:40.526
MAN:
<i>I'm telling you, you can't just</i>

02:40.528 --> 02:41.894
walk in here like this!

02:41.896 --> 02:45.230
...you're trespassing.
Look, I'm working...

02:45.232 --> 02:46.877
I'm working on it.
Three registered letters

02:46.878 --> 02:48.523
have been delivered
to this address.
I'm on top of it.

02:48.524 --> 02:50.169
I've been telling
you for weeks
Technically, you're trespassing.

02:50.171 --> 02:51.803
that if you just give me
a little bit more time.

02:51.805 --> 02:54.506
And just out of the blue?!
It's not my call, Mr. Wilkes.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.808
It's not my call.
Right.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.343
Look, you might
want to look

02:58.345 --> 02:59.912
into some storage options.

02:59.914 --> 03:01.680
The weather's not looking good.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.883
Lorne!
Kira, I don't want the kids
to see anymore of this.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.952
Why don't you go upstairs
and get your things?

03:06.954 --> 03:08.253
You're going to
stay at Nana's.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.322
That's a good boy.

03:11.292 --> 03:13.458
I'll call you tonight.

03:13.460 --> 03:15.427
We'll turn it around.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.197
(phone flips open)

03:18.199 --> 03:20.532
(dialing)

03:20.534 --> 03:21.667
(phone ringing through)

03:21.669 --> 03:23.936
(phone ringing)

03:26.240 --> 03:28.273
(phone beeps on)
Lorne.

03:28.275 --> 03:29.608
Hey, Brian?

03:29.610 --> 03:32.211
Lorne.

03:32.213 --> 03:34.313
Okay. Great.

03:34.315 --> 03:36.548
I'll call Stan
and I'll call you back.

03:36.550 --> 03:37.616
(phone beeps off)

03:39.320 --> 03:41.587
STAN:
<i> Yeah. Good.</i>

03:41.589 --> 03:43.655
I'll see you there.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.340
Ready?
(sighs)

04:01.342 --> 04:03.475
Yeah.

04:03.477 --> 04:05.577
Stan?

04:05.579 --> 04:07.446
All the way.

04:07.448 --> 04:09.514
Let's go.

04:11.452 --> 04:12.517
(sighs)

04:16.457 --> 04:18.523
¶ ¶

04:26.600 --> 04:28.000
SECURITY GUARD:
Can I help you?

04:29.637 --> 04:30.669
Excuse me,
can I help you?

04:30.671 --> 04:32.271
Morning.

04:36.510 --> 04:38.644
Hey, cover me.
I'm going to check this out.

04:51.625 --> 04:54.559
CELIA:
Meanwhile, some retail giants
are suffering

04:54.561 --> 04:57.829
as a result of debt-funded
stock buybacks.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.432
Now, having to deal with...

05:00.434 --> 05:01.933
I'll take that again.

05:03.037 --> 05:03.935
Excuse me, sir?

05:03.937 --> 05:05.604
Hey, how're you doing?

05:05.606 --> 05:07.406
I'm, I'm going to have to ask
you guys to leave.

05:07.408 --> 05:08.640
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.542
Uh, really, I don't want
to inconvenience you,

05:10.544 --> 05:12.044
but, uh...

05:12.046 --> 05:13.645
We'll be out of your
hair, but first,

05:13.647 --> 05:15.614
we want to talk to Joel Graves.
Yeah.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.949
This guy.
CEO of the Year.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.618
You'd be doing us
a big favor if you'd just

05:19.620 --> 05:21.586
radio that request upstairs
for us, all right?

05:21.588 --> 05:22.587
You got it?
Right, right.

05:22.589 --> 05:24.623
Okay.

05:24.625 --> 05:25.857
Sector Two, I'm going to need
some assistance

05:25.859 --> 05:27.526
in the Media Center.
That's not code for

05:27.528 --> 05:29.695
you want to kick me and my
friends out of here, is it?

05:29.697 --> 05:31.563
No-no, no.
'Cause we're account holders.

05:31.565 --> 05:32.731
Excuse me, I'm Celia Westfall.

05:32.733 --> 05:34.650
I'm with<i> CWGT Money Report.</i>

05:34.651 --> 05:36.568
Hi.
Do I understand you want
to talk to Joel Graves?

05:36.570 --> 05:37.769
Yeah, I do.
Can you turn that
camera off, please?

05:37.771 --> 05:38.603
No, keep it rolling.

05:38.605 --> 05:39.771
We're going to push back

05:39.773 --> 05:41.373
on your print proposal, John.

05:41.375 --> 05:43.608
We're going to go exclusively
digital, lower costs.

05:43.610 --> 05:44.976
And research shows the Internet

05:44.978 --> 05:46.912
is one of the last give-ups
of the consumer.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.814
Slogan stays the same,
"Your future first."

05:48.816 --> 05:50.716
Sorry to interrupt, Joel.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.584
Yeah, Howie?
You might want to hear this.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.753
There's a situation at the
Stock Exchange Media Center.

05:54.755 --> 05:56.355
Some kind of protest.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.789
Okay, so?

05:57.791 --> 05:59.858
They say they're Grayson Kearns
account holders.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.693
They want you
to come down and talk.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.128
(groans)

06:03.130 --> 06:06.498
"Homeless, thanks
to Grayson Kearns."

06:06.500 --> 06:09.067
Thoughts?
Well...

06:09.069 --> 06:10.535
You could go down,
put in some face time

06:10.537 --> 06:11.670
before this turns
into something.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.038
I could...
you know, you want

06:13.040 --> 06:14.673
to gift-wrap me
before you send me

06:14.675 --> 06:15.907
down there to be
a scapegoat, Howie?

06:15.909 --> 06:17.376
They're calling your bluff
on live TV,

06:17.378 --> 06:19.478
and they've got
a head start.
Look.

06:19.479 --> 06:21.579
I'll go down there, but what am
I supposed to say to these guys?

06:21.582 --> 06:23.014
"Listen, fellas,
I'm really sorry.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.983
This is just the
price you pay for
not planning ahead."

06:24.985 --> 06:26.651
Yeah, they're gonna enjoy
hearing me say that, right?

06:26.653 --> 06:27.652
Look, all I'm saying is...

06:27.654 --> 06:28.720
Ooh, or maybe

06:28.722 --> 06:30.021
I'll go down there and tell them

06:30.023 --> 06:31.656
that we're in
a mental recession,

06:31.658 --> 06:33.425
that, uh, we're all turning
into a nation of whiners,

06:33.427 --> 06:35.927
and we all have to stand
beside the choices we make,

06:35.929 --> 06:37.729
like, for example,
the choice not to rent.

06:37.731 --> 06:38.730
Joel.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.499
Howie, I'm joking.

06:40.501 --> 06:41.833
Joking.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.636
Go down there, give them
my personal regrets,

06:44.638 --> 06:46.505
tell them I'm tied up
for a little bit.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.540
Which is the truth. Okay?

06:48.542 --> 06:50.409
Listen, Howie,
there's gonna be cameras,

06:50.411 --> 06:52.677
so, you know, be nice.

06:52.679 --> 06:55.414
I'm always nice.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.682
So moving on...

06:57.684 --> 06:59.618
I see.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.253
So we're free to access

07:01.254 --> 07:02.887
the customer relations section
of your Web site.

07:02.890 --> 07:04.089
(laughs)

07:04.091 --> 07:05.457
Come on.

07:05.459 --> 07:06.591
That could be
a problem,

07:06.593 --> 07:08.660
'cause I don't have
a computer.

07:08.662 --> 07:09.928
Or a house to put one in.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.496
Mr...?

07:11.498 --> 07:12.864
You really care what my name is?

07:12.866 --> 07:16.768
I'm sure Mr. Graves would
consider a written request

07:16.770 --> 07:17.769
for a private meeting.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.155
As I'm sure you can appreciate,

07:20.156 --> 07:22.540
these are busy and challenging
times for us all.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.543
We look forward
to you getting in touch.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.610
Thanks so much.

07:27.214 --> 07:29.147
We'll remove them.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.516
No, let them stay.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.618
We don't want
to see that on TV.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.754
LORNE:
That's not supposed to happen.

07:35.756 --> 07:37.122
It's the same old brush-off.

07:37.124 --> 07:38.990
I thought Joel Graves
was a lush for the media,

07:38.992 --> 07:40.625
couldn't resist the spotlight.

07:40.627 --> 07:41.626
BRIAN:
Yeah.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.628
Well, it's fine.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.597
Fine.

07:45.599 --> 07:46.598
Plan B.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.799
We have a Plan B?

07:47.801 --> 07:48.934
Yeah.

07:48.936 --> 07:50.769
I'm going up.

07:50.771 --> 07:51.736
Then what?

07:51.738 --> 07:53.805
Then you'll see.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.257
Come on up.

07:55.258 --> 07:56.708
I'll tell you on the way.
Stan.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.844
Right here.

08:03.517 --> 08:05.584
Stay tight.
Stay tight.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.059
Okay, go, go, go, go!

08:17.130 --> 08:19.164
Code 113, elevator one.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.131
(elevator whirs)

08:20.133 --> 08:23.668
(Brian pants, coughs)

08:26.640 --> 08:28.573
It's not gonna work.

08:28.575 --> 08:29.641
Yes, it is.

08:29.643 --> 08:30.942
He won't come down.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.777
Let's call it off.

08:32.779 --> 08:35.714
No.

08:35.716 --> 08:38.717
This is plan B.

08:38.719 --> 08:40.552
All those nights we spent
talking about this--

08:40.554 --> 08:42.220
I'm not walking away.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.288
You do this, and we're in deep!

08:43.290 --> 08:44.589
Someone is gonna
sit down and listen.

08:44.591 --> 08:46.124
Someone is gonna do this right.

08:55.936 --> 08:57.736
Morning.

08:57.738 --> 08:59.070
I'd like to speak
to Joel Graves.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.573
Make the call.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.144
Do it now.

09:08.248 --> 09:12.317
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

09:40.948 --> 09:43.148
Probably the
same as you.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.883
There's no place
like this.

09:44.885 --> 09:46.935
No work like this.

09:46.936 --> 09:48.986
Your skills, you could work
any number of different places.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.022
You did well in undercover.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.591
(sighs):
Yeah.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.292
I've done my time
behind enemy lines.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.327
Enemy?

09:55.329 --> 09:57.729
Sorry.

09:57.731 --> 09:59.448
I don't mean...
Now, you know,

09:59.449 --> 10:01.166
the whole war zone imagery
doesn't really fly around here.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.334
Okay.

10:02.336 --> 10:04.269
Sorry.

10:04.271 --> 10:05.971
You know what I mean.
Do I?

10:08.976 --> 10:10.308
It's an expression.

10:10.310 --> 10:11.910
Come on.
Oh, yeah.

10:11.912 --> 10:13.111
It's a pretty
revealing expression.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.283
You're mirroring me.

10:18.285 --> 10:20.085
What...

10:20.087 --> 10:21.019
Your body language.

10:21.021 --> 10:23.221
You're showing me me now.

10:23.223 --> 10:26.658
Do you know you're doing that
or is that just reflex by now

10:26.660 --> 10:29.861
from all your time
among the enemy?

10:31.832 --> 10:33.632
(sighs)

10:33.634 --> 10:37.168
Constable Sabine,
you got the bonding moves down--

10:37.170 --> 10:38.903
belonging, being what

10:38.905 --> 10:39.904
someone wants to see.

10:39.906 --> 10:41.373
And that's all
very, very useful.

10:41.375 --> 10:44.075
But it concerns me a little

10:44.077 --> 10:46.311
when your psych eval
shows inconsistencies

10:46.313 --> 10:47.779
on self-reporting.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.247
It's like you can't
keep your story straight

10:49.249 --> 10:50.749
about who you are.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.018
This job,
connecting to people,

10:53.020 --> 10:55.353
I need to know you've got
something to draw from.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.055
KIRA (over P.A.):
Team One, suit up.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.323
Hot call, hot call.
Okay, hold on.

10:58.325 --> 11:01.059
Gunman at large
in the Commerce Tower.

11:01.061 --> 11:04.229
Someone to draw from.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.697
We'll pick this up later.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.065
Awesome.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.134
<i> Awesome,</i> yeah.

11:09.136 --> 11:11.202
(alarm blaring)

11:11.972 --> 11:13.738
Kira, how many gunmen?

11:13.740 --> 11:15.707
We have multiple witnesses
reporting a single gunman

11:15.709 --> 11:17.942
or pair of gunmen at different
areas on the 11th floor.

11:17.944 --> 11:19.377
Could be one suspect,
could be a team.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.813
What are they carrying?
Handgun, rifle,

11:21.815 --> 11:23.715
shotgun--
take your pick.

11:23.717 --> 11:26.117
Joel Graves, need a minute
of your time.

11:26.119 --> 11:27.852
MAN (over P.A.):
Your attention, please.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.437
We're experiencing
an emergency situation...

11:29.438 --> 11:31.021
Joel Graves-- do you know
where his office is?

11:31.024 --> 11:32.691
Commerce Tower will be
on lockdown

11:32.693 --> 11:34.693
until the security issues...
We're not here to hurt anyone.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.327
We just want to talk
to your boss.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.929
Do you know where
his office is?

11:37.931 --> 11:39.042
Do not attempt
to leave the building.

11:39.043 --> 11:40.154
We just want to talk
to your boss.

11:40.155 --> 11:41.266
Thank you for your cooperation.
Where's his office?!

11:41.268 --> 11:43.468
Once again, a man...
Graves?

11:43.470 --> 11:45.470
Commerce Tower will be
on lockdown.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.472
Thank you for your patience
as we deal with this situation.

11:47.474 --> 11:50.241
Executive floor. Let's go.

11:52.012 --> 11:53.712
She rappels like a spider.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.013
Thinks on her feet.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.981
Is it time for a vote
yet or what?

11:56.983 --> 11:59.417
I'm thinking
I need to think some more.

11:59.419 --> 12:00.819
It's a no-brainer.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.454
She's got the chops,
no question about it.

12:02.456 --> 12:04.723
But?

12:04.725 --> 12:06.725
Boss needs to think.

12:06.727 --> 12:08.893
Copy that. Boss needs to think.
Let's go.

12:12.799 --> 12:15.834
(sirens wailing)

12:15.836 --> 12:17.736
I'm gonna just, uh...
I'm going to call security,

12:17.738 --> 12:18.937
see what the deal is.

12:18.939 --> 12:21.906
Joel, it's the men
that wanted to see you.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.041
One of them's got a gun.

12:23.043 --> 12:24.442
MAN (over P.A.):
Your attention, please.

12:24.444 --> 12:27.045
We're currently experiencing
an emergency situation

12:27.047 --> 12:28.213
in the building.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.148
Commerce Tower will be
under lockdown.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.216
until the security issues...
Hey.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.383
Come here.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.419
Hey, hey.

12:35.522 --> 12:37.088
Get out of my way!

12:37.090 --> 12:38.757
Thank you for your cooperation.

12:38.759 --> 12:40.759
(grunting)

12:56.176 --> 12:59.043
I don't know how
this could happen.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.412
How anything like this
could happen.

13:04.050 --> 13:05.183
I think
you'll find out everything

13:05.185 --> 13:06.551
you need to know about it

13:06.553 --> 13:08.553
when he gets down here.

13:08.555 --> 13:11.189
If I were you, I'd stand back.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.292
(panicked murmuring)

13:14.294 --> 13:16.060
Go on, get out of here!

13:16.062 --> 13:18.129
Stand back!

13:19.132 --> 13:20.532
PARKER:
Number of suspects?

13:20.534 --> 13:23.168
Two guys split off
from the older one
in the Media Center,

13:23.170 --> 13:24.803
demanding to see
the Grayson Kearns CEO.

13:24.805 --> 13:26.070
PARKER:
Media Center,
what's that?

13:26.072 --> 13:28.273
It's down the escalator
off the trading floor.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.208
It's where the reporters do
all their stand-and-talks.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.209
Lots of big screens,
tickers.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.094
It's like you're right there.

13:33.095 --> 13:34.978
The subject in the
Media Center, is he armed?

13:34.981 --> 13:36.748
No, no visible weapons.

13:36.749 --> 13:38.516
My guys are
holding him there.
Cops just showed.

13:38.518 --> 13:41.319
I've got CCTV tapes.
Eddie, I'll take the guy
in the Media Center.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.520
Spike, you're my second.

13:42.522 --> 13:44.289
Set up command post
at the security desk.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.257
Copy.
Where were the gunmen
last seen?

13:46.259 --> 13:48.226
Grayson Kearns
Head Office, 11th floor.

13:48.228 --> 13:49.828
Lou, Sam, Wordy, with me.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.496
We need one of those elevators
unlocked.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.364
Keep the rest
of them shut down tight.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.169
He what?

13:58.171 --> 14:01.172
The guy's spilling
gasoline everywhere.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.181
PARKER:
Hey, buddy,
what's going on?

14:10.183 --> 14:11.182
What are you doing?

14:11.184 --> 14:12.917
Don't touch the camera.

14:12.919 --> 14:14.185
The camera stays on.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.120
I'm not going
to touch anything.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.188
What are you
doing that for?

14:17.190 --> 14:18.556
Come on, just
put that down.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.258
Stay back! Stay back!
Okay, okay.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.127
But why don't we just go
outside, we can talk about this.

14:26.466 --> 14:28.600
I warned you.

14:28.602 --> 14:30.501
Stay back.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.145
Nobody comes
any closer.

14:41.147 --> 14:44.282
Okay, okay.

14:44.284 --> 14:46.184
All right, let's all
just move back.

14:46.186 --> 14:48.953
Let's give
this man some space.

14:48.955 --> 14:50.455
Give him some space.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.056
11:09 a.m.

14:52.058 --> 14:53.191
Sergeant Gregory Parker
initiates negotiation.

14:53.193 --> 14:55.560
Subject is level red,

14:55.562 --> 14:56.995
threatening self-immolation.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.663
Hi, my name's Greg Parker.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.649
I'm with the Police Strategic
Response Unit.

15:00.650 --> 15:02.634
And I'm here to listen to
whatever you have to say, sir.

15:02.636 --> 15:03.635
I'm here to help you.

15:03.637 --> 15:05.203
I'm not going anywhere.

15:05.205 --> 15:08.072
Nope. No one's going to force
you to do anything.

15:08.074 --> 15:11.342
(whispering):
Spike, let's get the fire
department on standby,

15:11.344 --> 15:13.444
but no entry. Repeat, no entry
until my command.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.247
Let's get ambulances
in the area on standby as well.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.749
Copy that.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.250
Let's evacuate the area,
and then I need you

15:19.252 --> 15:21.953
in the security room
with my guy, all right?
Yeah.

15:21.955 --> 15:23.488
Miss, did you
talk to him?

15:23.490 --> 15:25.323
I want you to stay
right there, okay?

15:25.325 --> 15:27.025
All right.
(clears throat)

15:27.027 --> 15:29.227
Spike, we've got
a gentleman here

15:29.229 --> 15:31.229
releasing gasoline
into an enclosed room

15:31.231 --> 15:33.097
without any ventilation.

15:33.099 --> 15:36.167
The, uh, concentration of vapors
is high and growing,

15:36.169 --> 15:38.202
and he's holding
a lighter.

15:38.204 --> 15:39.637
Well, it's not just the lighter
I'm worried about.

15:39.639 --> 15:41.272
Anything sets off a spark,
you got a fireball.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.507
Firearms for instance?

15:42.509 --> 15:44.275
All firearms--
lethal, nonlethal.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.110
A muzzle flash would
be all it takes.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.329
All right, copy that.

15:48.330 --> 15:50.547
See if you can get some air flow
going in here, too, okay?

15:52.118 --> 15:53.251
Sir...

15:53.253 --> 15:55.553
it's Greg again.

15:55.555 --> 15:58.556
What's your name?

15:58.558 --> 16:00.124
If you don't want to
tell me, that's fine.

16:00.126 --> 16:01.426
If you don't want
to talk to me,

16:01.428 --> 16:04.095
that's not a problem.
No pressure.

16:04.097 --> 16:07.665
In fact, I'll
tell you what,

16:07.667 --> 16:10.134
I'll give you one less thing
to worry about, okay?

16:10.136 --> 16:13.404
I want everyone with a firearm
to leave this room.

16:13.406 --> 16:15.506
Everyone with
a firearm.

16:15.508 --> 16:17.208
Fast is good.

16:17.210 --> 16:18.276
Right now.

16:25.285 --> 16:26.617
Okay.

16:27.654 --> 16:30.388
Okay, all done.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.556
All right?

16:46.339 --> 16:48.473
Got CCTV of our subjects.

16:48.475 --> 16:51.175
Portraits of the gunmen
coming at you.

16:52.112 --> 16:55.380
I'll be right here.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.182
Can we cut the video?

16:58.184 --> 17:00.151
We can't reach
our cameras from here.

17:00.153 --> 17:02.387
And I don't think he's going
to want us to turn them off.

17:02.389 --> 17:03.554
That's sort of
why he's here.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.324
Oh, yeah?
What'd he tell you?

17:06.326 --> 17:08.326
Well, he and two others
have been trying to get

17:08.328 --> 17:10.211
Joel Graves' attention
for a long time.

17:10.212 --> 17:12.095
Joel Graves-- he's the guy
who collects a fat bonus

17:12.098 --> 17:13.131
while Rome burns, right?

17:13.133 --> 17:14.632
This is the guy.

17:14.634 --> 17:16.734
Okay, I want you to tell me
about his company,

17:16.736 --> 17:17.802
Grayson Kearns.
Okay.

17:35.321 --> 17:37.221
ED:
SRU. Which way did they go?

17:37.223 --> 17:39.724
Clear.
Everyone stay calm.

17:39.726 --> 17:42.060
We're with the SRU. Stay calm
please, everyone. Stay calm.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.628
Hands where we can
see them, folks.

17:43.630 --> 17:45.163
Stay calm. Thank you.

17:45.165 --> 17:47.465
Clear.
Hands where we can see them.

17:50.470 --> 17:52.270
Folks, I need to see
your hands, please.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.271
We're with the SRU.

17:53.273 --> 17:55.606
Let's see some hands.

17:55.608 --> 17:58.076
Clear.
Which way did the gunman go?

17:58.078 --> 18:00.478
SRU. Please stay calm.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.114
Clear.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.851
(softly):
All right, let
me get this.

18:06.853 --> 18:09.253
Grayson Kearns gives away
mortgages like it's candy.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.722
When the market slides, they
dump their high-risk clients

18:11.724 --> 18:13.191
to the highest
bidder, right?

18:13.193 --> 18:14.325
Who re-offer at rates

18:14.327 --> 18:17.395
these guys can't afford.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.729
You know, they seemed

18:18.731 --> 18:20.431
like regular guys.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.100
They probably just want
their houses back.

18:22.102 --> 18:24.335
Yeah, I think our friend
wants more than that.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.303
He tell you his name?

18:25.305 --> 18:26.571
Stan Matthews.

18:26.573 --> 18:27.605
Okay, thanks.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.207
You can get out of here.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.641
Thank you very much.

18:35.348 --> 18:37.315
Fire department's
on standby, boss,

18:37.317 --> 18:38.683
waiting for permission
to deploy.

18:38.685 --> 18:40.284
Negative.

18:40.286 --> 18:42.270
Negative. If he sees fire hoses,

18:42.271 --> 18:44.255
he just needs a split second
to beat them to the punch

18:44.257 --> 18:46.341
and spark an explosion.

18:46.342 --> 18:48.426
Copy that. They got to stay out
of the line of sight.

18:48.428 --> 18:50.161
Gotta keep thinking
outside the toolbox.

18:52.432 --> 18:54.732
It's all right, sir.

18:54.734 --> 18:57.368
I understand you're looking
for some information

18:57.370 --> 18:59.904
from Joel Graves.

18:59.906 --> 19:02.707
He's been in the spotlight
quite a bit these days, huh?

19:02.709 --> 19:04.709
He's doing okay for himself.

19:04.711 --> 19:08.412
You're talking about the
$22 million-- his bonus?

19:08.414 --> 19:10.348
Yeah, yeah, something
like that.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.749
Here's a guy who's
got four houses already.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.452
Books a five-star Caribbean
resort with his buddies,

19:14.454 --> 19:16.187
to brainstorm about
how to "make the most

19:16.189 --> 19:17.421
of these troubled times."

19:17.423 --> 19:19.390
What can you do?

19:21.828 --> 19:24.328
What do you want from him?

19:24.330 --> 19:26.531
I want him down here.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.466
Okay, all right.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.735
Let's work on that.

19:30.737 --> 19:33.538
Spike, let's get
a 20 on Joel Graves.

19:39.379 --> 19:40.411
It's not too late.

19:40.413 --> 19:41.679
What do you mean?

19:41.681 --> 19:43.714
Maybe we walk away
before the cops find us.

19:43.716 --> 19:45.583
Lorne...
I'm just saying,

19:45.585 --> 19:47.251
all the times we
talked about it,

19:47.253 --> 19:48.619
we never talked about it
happening like this.

19:48.621 --> 19:49.787
Hands. Please let
me see your hands.

19:49.789 --> 19:51.455
Please sit down.
Take a seat.

19:51.457 --> 19:53.524
Ma'am, let's see
your hands, please.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.193
Let's see your hands.
Take a seat.

19:55.195 --> 19:57.328
We have I.D. on one of our guys.
Stan Matthews.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.630
He's a Grayson Kearns
account holder. They all are.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.567
I've narrowed the national list
by city, male account holders--

20:02.569 --> 20:04.202
there's still a lot.

20:04.204 --> 20:05.736
Might want to try
recent foreclosures.

20:05.738 --> 20:07.905
Foreclosures...

20:07.907 --> 20:09.507
Here he is, Stan Matthews.

20:09.509 --> 20:11.509
Here's another one who lives
on the same street,

20:11.511 --> 20:12.977
a Lorne Wilkes.

20:12.978 --> 20:14.444
Good-- see any other
connections?

20:14.447 --> 20:15.947
Hold on.

20:15.949 --> 20:18.249
There's a Brian Baumann--
same employer as Lorne Wilkes.

20:18.251 --> 20:19.884
Ex-employer.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.518
They were both recently laid off
from the auto plant.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.554
Copy that. You know what'd
be really great, Kira?

20:23.556 --> 20:24.555
Some cell numbers
for these guys.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.557
Copy, copy.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.259
You need to send someone now!
Right now!

20:28.261 --> 20:29.427
Think of Stan.

20:29.429 --> 20:31.462
You remember that
night, right?
Yeah.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.730
Yeah? You with me?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.398
Yeah.

20:34.400 --> 20:34.966
(door opens)

20:35.969 --> 20:38.536
Hey, hey.

20:38.538 --> 20:39.837
I'm going to need your keys.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.672
Elevator...

20:41.674 --> 20:44.475
You'll need this one
for the elevator.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.444
Here.

20:47.380 --> 20:48.446
Thanks.

20:48.448 --> 20:49.814
I'm telling you,
they're at my door.

20:51.517 --> 20:53.584
Okay...

20:53.586 --> 20:54.852
Mr. Graves.

20:54.854 --> 20:58.656
Uh... what can I do
for you guys?

20:58.658 --> 21:00.725
You're coming with us
downstairs.

21:00.727 --> 21:02.393
You're going to go on camera.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.996
Uh, and then what?

21:04.998 --> 21:07.632
Oh, we'll talk-- about trust,

21:07.634 --> 21:10.001
some promises you didn't keep.

21:10.003 --> 21:11.602
"Your Future First."

21:11.604 --> 21:13.571
You don't care
about our future.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.606
His family's
on the street.

21:15.608 --> 21:17.642
I'm living out of the car
the past few weeks.

21:17.644 --> 21:19.443
So, whose future's coming
first here?

21:19.445 --> 21:21.345
No, no, we're going downstairs.

21:21.347 --> 21:22.546
Okay, listen to me.

21:22.548 --> 21:24.482
I'm sorry to hear
about your losses, I am,

21:24.484 --> 21:27.318
but I've been juggling thousands
of losses, guys.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.519
It's my job.

21:28.521 --> 21:29.887
I'm just doing my job.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.389
(scoffs)

21:31.391 --> 21:32.757
You know what your job is now?

21:32.759 --> 21:34.325
It's to own up,

21:34.327 --> 21:35.893
take responsibility.

21:35.895 --> 21:37.662
Huh...?

21:40.767 --> 21:42.633
(grunting)

21:43.069 --> 21:44.602
Let go.

21:44.604 --> 21:45.836
Get...

21:45.838 --> 21:47.672
Let go!

21:47.674 --> 21:48.906
Let go!

21:49.809 --> 21:51.475
Okay, okay.

21:51.477 --> 21:55.646
We need to end this, huh?

21:55.648 --> 21:56.981
We need to end this.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.483
Brian?

22:03.556 --> 22:04.755
It's right there.
Thank you.

22:04.757 --> 22:06.557
We're going to need
your pass key.

22:06.559 --> 22:07.625
Those guys took it.

22:07.627 --> 22:09.560
So how is that fair?

22:09.562 --> 22:10.861
Can you explain that to me?

22:10.863 --> 22:13.597
I don't know. Tell me, Stan.

22:13.599 --> 22:17.601
Just me and Carol. 39 years.

22:17.603 --> 22:21.105
I hated math,
she hated power tools,

22:21.107 --> 22:22.540
so we had a deal.

22:22.542 --> 22:24.809
She managed the
books, I worked.

22:24.811 --> 22:25.943
We scraped together

22:25.945 --> 22:28.429
everything we had,

22:28.430 --> 22:30.914
and we found this little mutt
of a fixer-upper.

22:30.917 --> 22:31.916
Didn't look like much,

22:31.918 --> 22:35.419
but we knew what
it could be.

22:35.421 --> 22:40.658
And I'll never...
I'll never understand

22:40.660 --> 22:42.860
why she would do something
like that.

22:42.862 --> 22:47.031
What do you mean?
What-what happened, Stan?

22:47.033 --> 22:49.800
I loved that woman.

22:49.802 --> 22:53.003
I loved her.

22:53.005 --> 22:56.574
I'm so fed up.

22:56.576 --> 22:58.776
Stan, Stan,
it's okay, it's okay.

22:58.778 --> 23:02.012
It really is okay.

23:02.014 --> 23:03.614
Why don't we
take a break?

23:03.616 --> 23:05.082
Huh?

23:05.084 --> 23:07.051
Tell you the truth,
I'm getting a headache.

23:07.053 --> 23:08.686
from all the fumes.

23:08.688 --> 23:11.155
Why don't we just step outside
and just get some air?

23:11.157 --> 23:13.124
No! No!

23:13.126 --> 23:15.793
Okay, you don't have
to do that, Stan.
No!

23:27.774 --> 23:28.873
It's locked.

23:31.811 --> 23:33.411
Okay.

23:35.648 --> 23:37.715
Police! Don't move!
Don't move!
Police! Don't move!

23:37.717 --> 23:39.984
Police!
Police! Clear.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.619
Ed, we got a hallway.

23:41.621 --> 23:44.422
Ed, elevators are locked down,
right?

23:44.424 --> 23:45.022
Affirmative.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.857
Well, elevator three's

23:46.859 --> 23:48.859
on the move. Floor 12
going down. Hang on.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.528
Where are
the other elevators?

23:50.530 --> 23:51.462
Ground floor.

23:51.464 --> 23:53.147
Stairs are faster.

23:53.148 --> 23:54.831
All right, heads up, guys.
Subjects are on the move.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.967
They probably have security
cards and keys.

23:56.969 --> 23:59.136
Spike, get me uniforms
on all the elevator exits

23:59.138 --> 24:01.138
in case they step out
before they reach bottom.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.674
Security has reported
two men entering the elevator.

24:03.676 --> 24:05.209
Just two? Where's Graves?

24:05.211 --> 24:07.077
Kira's got cell numbers.
You want to give it a try?

24:07.079 --> 24:08.913
Negative.
You make the call, Spike.

24:08.915 --> 24:10.815
I need m full attention
on my subject here.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.786
Not responding on the phone.

24:15.788 --> 24:17.621
They stopped the elevator
between floors:

24:17.623 --> 24:19.790
floor seven, floor six.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.958
Sam, Lou, cover the sixth floor
exit. We'll go above.

24:21.961 --> 24:24.228
Copy that. Bravo team
proceeding on foot.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.741
(grunting)

24:37.743 --> 24:39.677
(tools clanging)

24:42.915 --> 24:44.181
(grunting)

24:44.183 --> 24:48.018
(tools clanging)

25:10.676 --> 25:13.711
Bravo team in position.

25:13.713 --> 25:15.513
Still no response
on the phone.

25:15.515 --> 25:17.748
What can you tell me
about overriding
manual controls?

25:17.750 --> 25:19.817
Listen up, guys.
We got a window of opportunity.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.252
There's a trap in the ceiling.

25:21.254 --> 25:23.254
I don't feel like dropping in
without a distraction.

25:23.256 --> 25:24.221
I hear ya.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.256
CS gas standing by.

25:25.258 --> 25:26.557
No 555s.

25:26.559 --> 25:28.726
There's 90 cubic feet
of air in there.

25:28.728 --> 25:29.727
What about 517s?

25:29.729 --> 25:31.128
Still overkill in that space.

25:31.130 --> 25:33.764
Ditto flash bangs. Serious risk
of eye and ear damage.

25:33.766 --> 25:36.267
Hey, hey, how about this,
training flash bang?

25:36.269 --> 25:38.035
Used them on the recruits
this morning.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.803
You got trainee flash bangs?

25:39.805 --> 25:41.772
Sure. Just open the doors
a little first.

25:41.774 --> 25:44.842
Reduce the concussive effect.
I like it. Let's do it.

25:44.844 --> 25:47.845
Okay, the elevator has two
emergency override patterns:

25:47.847 --> 25:50.047
the ground floor and the
nearest-floor cycle pattern.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.982
Drop them down a floor.
We'll deploy from above.

25:51.984 --> 25:54.652
Sam, Lou, meet and greet
when the doors open.

25:54.654 --> 25:55.819
Copy.
Got it.

25:55.821 --> 25:57.021
Boss, you good with this?

25:57.023 --> 25:58.556
Just go careful.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.157
These guys don't have records.

26:00.159 --> 26:03.127
Just sounds like they've
been pushed too hard.

26:07.733 --> 26:08.799
Ready.

26:13.005 --> 26:15.706
Copy that.
Distraction standing by.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.174
Standing by.
Standing by.

26:17.176 --> 26:19.176
Spike, countdown
override procedure.

26:19.178 --> 26:24.648
Override in five, four,
three, two, one.

26:24.650 --> 26:25.783
Triggering override.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.318
Distraction on my go.

26:31.958 --> 26:33.891
Back off. Back off!

26:33.893 --> 26:35.159
Hold. Hold, Eddie.

26:35.161 --> 26:36.794
He's got Graves.

26:41.601 --> 26:44.101
11:36 a.m., armed subject
with hostage in elevator.

26:44.103 --> 26:46.036
We have one subject
in the elevator

26:46.038 --> 26:48.772
with Joel Graves. He's armed
with a snub-nosed .38.

26:48.774 --> 26:50.174
Fall back. New deal.

26:50.176 --> 26:52.109
Hostage situation.
Decrease pressure.

26:52.111 --> 26:55.012
Copy that. Wordy, I'm coming up.

26:55.014 --> 26:58.048
Spike, keep trying the phone.
Maybe they're ready to talk now.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.150
No, no, no.
See if we can get

27:00.152 --> 27:01.285
the ventilation
going in here,

27:01.287 --> 27:03.187
and keep your guys
out of sight.

27:03.189 --> 27:07.224
(sighs, clears throat)

27:07.226 --> 27:08.759
All right, change of plan.

27:08.761 --> 27:11.895
Spike, go for the ground-floor
override sequence.

27:11.897 --> 27:13.831
A lot more tac options
in the open lobby

27:13.833 --> 27:15.199
than one of these hallways.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.401
Freeze!

27:17.403 --> 27:18.636
Freeze!

27:18.638 --> 27:19.670
I'm giving up.

27:19.672 --> 27:21.939
Put your hands
on your head!

27:21.940 --> 27:24.207
Hands on your head!
Stay right there.
Stay right where you are!

27:24.210 --> 27:28.679
Come here. Come here.
We got a subject who
has surrendered.

27:28.681 --> 27:31.248
Copy that, Sam. You're Sierra.

27:31.250 --> 27:32.883
Lou, let's bring
the guy down here.

27:32.885 --> 27:34.351
Copy.
Okay.

27:34.353 --> 27:35.419
Got him.

27:38.424 --> 27:39.423
What's he gonna do?

27:39.425 --> 27:41.025
That depends
on your friend.

27:41.027 --> 27:42.026
Please,
don't hurt him.

27:42.028 --> 27:42.993
We don't want to.

27:42.995 --> 27:45.162
Why don't you
help us out?

27:45.164 --> 27:47.164
(sniffs)
What's that smell?

27:47.166 --> 27:48.666
What's going on?

27:48.668 --> 27:49.967
We're trying
to help your friend.

27:49.969 --> 27:50.968
What happened?

27:50.970 --> 27:53.070
You don't know?

27:53.072 --> 27:56.173
He soaked the room with gas
including himself,

27:56.175 --> 27:58.142
and now he's threatening
to light it up

27:58.144 --> 28:01.779
Oh, my God. No, no, none
of this was supposed

28:01.781 --> 28:04.081
to go like this.
Let me talk to him.

28:04.083 --> 28:06.083
I can't let you do that.
Lou, I got him. It's okay.

28:06.085 --> 28:08.819
You want
to help your friend?

28:08.821 --> 28:11.021
You need
to keep talking to me.

28:11.023 --> 28:14.825
Spike, the gas
in the media room,

28:14.827 --> 28:17.294
I think we got another option.

28:17.296 --> 28:19.129
Talk to me, Lou.

28:19.130 --> 28:20.963
How close can we get
to the subject?

28:20.966 --> 28:25.002
(phone ringing)

28:25.004 --> 28:26.203
You gonna
answer that?

28:27.973 --> 28:29.373
(phone beeps off)

28:31.377 --> 28:34.178
You know, you don't seem
like the kind of guy.

28:34.180 --> 28:36.330
What kind of guy?

28:36.331 --> 28:38.481
The kind of guy
who makes his point with a gun.

28:38.484 --> 28:41.318
What would you know about that?

28:41.320 --> 28:44.254
In my line of work,
you meet a lot of people.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.156
You get a sense.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.095
You know, I got two kids.

28:51.097 --> 28:54.198
My buddy Lorne has two kids.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.901
They went out for
a drive today,
cross-country,

28:57.903 --> 29:00.471
go live in a house
that smells like other people.

29:00.473 --> 29:03.741
They got to watch their dad
sell everything that they own

29:03.743 --> 29:05.976
for less than what you'd pay
for a business brunch.

29:05.978 --> 29:09.813
So you thinking
about what kind
of guy Lorne was

29:09.815 --> 29:11.248
before he sold out
his family's future?

29:11.250 --> 29:13.250
No one's accountable.

29:13.252 --> 29:14.885
We're all just
pieces of paper

29:14.887 --> 29:16.520
crossing his desk.

29:16.521 --> 29:18.154
He sells a piece of paper,
and we lose everything.

29:18.157 --> 29:19.757
That's what happened
to Stan, too?

29:19.759 --> 29:22.259
Brian and me worked
at the plant 11 years

29:22.261 --> 29:23.861
till it closed five months ago.

29:23.863 --> 29:25.763
Stan lives on Brian's street.

29:25.765 --> 29:27.397
We've all been buddies
a long time.

29:27.399 --> 29:31.168
Brian thought...

29:31.170 --> 29:32.970
he was doing us a favor.

29:32.972 --> 29:35.773
Here's these amazing
mortgage deals...

29:35.775 --> 29:37.341
He talked you
and Stan into it?

29:37.343 --> 29:40.010
Me and Carol.

29:40.012 --> 29:41.512
Carol, Stan's wife?

29:41.514 --> 29:44.448
Late wife.

29:49.155 --> 29:52.956
Stan-- Stan fixed this place
up with this own hands.

29:52.958 --> 29:56.226
Did it for Carol.
Did it to give her the home

29:56.228 --> 29:57.461
she always
dreamed about.

29:57.463 --> 30:00.297
Then one day,
they get a letter in the mail.

30:00.299 --> 30:05.068
Her payments have been tripled,
and there's no way they can pay.

30:05.070 --> 30:08.338
Their pension's
already decimated.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.340
What are they going to give up?

30:10.342 --> 30:13.177
Heating? Groceries?

30:13.179 --> 30:15.245
She sees it coming, right?

30:15.247 --> 30:19.116
All they put into it.
All he did for her.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.918
It's all gonna be gone.

30:20.920 --> 30:22.419
But she can't bring herself
to tell him,

30:22.421 --> 30:24.288
so she hides it, right?

30:24.290 --> 30:28.358
And hides it.
One day, she's out of time.

30:31.063 --> 30:35.265
Makes no sense. I mean,
you love someone,

30:35.267 --> 30:39.269
you stick around
and you fight, but...

30:39.271 --> 30:43.340
she couldn't.

30:43.342 --> 30:49.112
He comes home after work
one day, and he finds her...

30:49.114 --> 30:53.183
he finds his wife...

30:53.185 --> 30:57.588
That wasn't
a great day.

30:57.590 --> 30:59.423
You really think
Graves is gonna care,

30:59.425 --> 31:02.359
or you just want him to see
what he's done?

31:02.361 --> 31:05.262
We want him to see
the people he's wrecked

31:05.264 --> 31:06.930
up close.

31:06.932 --> 31:10.400
We want his face on camera
saying, "I made this choice.

31:10.402 --> 31:13.403
"I sold out
a thousand families

31:13.405 --> 31:15.505
"for the price
of my $22-million bonus.

31:15.507 --> 31:17.441
"I knew what I was doing

31:17.443 --> 31:20.444
and I did it anyway
and I'm sorry."

31:20.446 --> 31:24.114
Okay.

31:24.116 --> 31:25.415
Constable.

31:26.886 --> 31:28.318
Eddie, I need to stay here
with Stan.

31:28.320 --> 31:29.453
That's all
it'll take!

31:29.455 --> 31:31.455
I need you to meet
at the elevator

31:31.457 --> 31:33.240
and start negotiating.

31:33.241 --> 31:35.024
You catch that conversation
I had with my friend Lorne?

31:35.027 --> 31:36.426
Yeah, I copied.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.396
Okay.

31:39.398 --> 31:41.999
Spike, start
the override procedure.

31:42.001 --> 31:44.067
(elevator whirs)

31:44.069 --> 31:46.203
Okay, listen
to me, please.

31:46.205 --> 31:47.304
No, you listen to me.

31:47.306 --> 31:49.373
You're gonna do this,
you understand me?

31:49.375 --> 31:50.908
You're gonna do this,

31:50.910 --> 31:52.376
or you're not walking
out of here.

31:52.378 --> 31:55.479
You're not going home,
you understand?
Okay. Mm.

31:57.483 --> 31:59.116
I can't hold the elevator
doors open

31:59.118 --> 32:01.585
when they hit the lobby.
It'll cycle open automatically.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.087
And we're five, four,

32:04.089 --> 32:07.090
three, two, one.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.132
Move away.

32:15.134 --> 32:17.567
Move away!

32:27.112 --> 32:28.412
My name's Ed Lane.

32:28.414 --> 32:30.013
I'm with the Police
Strategic Response Unit.

32:30.015 --> 32:31.014
How you doing?

32:31.016 --> 32:32.182
Get out of the way.

32:32.184 --> 32:34.051
It's Brian, right? Brian?

32:34.053 --> 32:35.319
We're coming through.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.020
What's going on?
Have you got him?

32:37.022 --> 32:38.772
Is he coming?!

32:38.773 --> 32:40.523
Just try and understand
where we're at, Stan.

32:40.526 --> 32:41.992
Boss, me and Lou

32:41.994 --> 32:43.527
are working on Option B.

32:43.528 --> 32:45.061
Big reno on the main floor.
Big paint job.

32:45.064 --> 32:47.331
We may be able
to neutralize it later.

32:47.333 --> 32:49.533
Could buy you a few seconds.

32:49.535 --> 32:51.034
Yeah, I hear you. That's good.

32:51.036 --> 32:52.569
You'd better get him here!

32:52.571 --> 32:54.354
I'm done waiting!

32:54.355 --> 32:56.138
Just calm, just calm, Stan.
Just stay with me.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.175
Lou's got uniforms moving on it.

32:58.177 --> 33:00.177
Okay, but move fast.
Move real fast and give Ed

33:00.179 --> 33:01.545
whatever background you can
on Brian Baumann.

33:01.547 --> 33:02.713
Okay.

33:02.715 --> 33:04.081
Okay.

33:04.083 --> 33:05.382
Still working on it.

33:05.384 --> 33:06.516
We're still working on it.

33:06.518 --> 33:07.517
Five more minutes.

33:07.519 --> 33:08.719
Five more minutes.

33:10.389 --> 33:11.755
I got the solution.

33:11.757 --> 33:12.556
Copy that.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.091
He's going to talk.

33:14.093 --> 33:15.258
You're going
to talk, right?

33:15.260 --> 33:17.494
I know what's going on
here, Brian, okay?

33:17.496 --> 33:20.063
And I gotta tell you
right out of the gate,

33:20.065 --> 33:21.164
I'm sympathetic.

33:21.166 --> 33:22.282
Laid off

33:22.283 --> 33:23.399
from the auto plant
five months ago.

33:23.402 --> 33:25.068
Lost his house to foreclosure.

33:25.070 --> 33:27.270
No listed address. No family.

33:27.272 --> 33:30.374
We got a lot of people here,
Brian, who are very sympathetic.

33:30.376 --> 33:32.442
They understand

33:32.444 --> 33:33.543
exactly what it is
you're going through.

33:33.545 --> 33:34.711
No, they don't.
They don't.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.113
Yeah, they do.
No, they don't.

33:36.115 --> 33:37.381
That's why we're going

33:37.383 --> 33:39.483
in there with the cameras,
and he's going to say

33:39.485 --> 33:40.751
what he's done.

33:40.753 --> 33:42.452
That's what
we're here for.

33:42.454 --> 33:44.087
I get that, Brian.

33:44.089 --> 33:46.790
Okay, I get that.

33:46.791 --> 33:49.492
When I was a kid, I saw my folks
go through the very same thing.

33:49.495 --> 33:52.029
You feel helpless.

33:52.031 --> 33:53.196
You get it?

33:53.198 --> 33:55.265
Then you get why this guy
has to go in there

33:55.267 --> 33:56.666
and own up
to what he's done.

33:56.668 --> 33:58.101
Where is he?

33:58.103 --> 33:59.269
What do you want, Stan?

33:59.271 --> 34:00.437
Why aren't you
letting him through?

34:00.439 --> 34:01.605
Brian, and Lorne,

34:01.607 --> 34:03.640
they want
to make things right again.

34:03.642 --> 34:06.143
Lorne wants a house
for his family.

34:06.145 --> 34:09.212
I get that, but what do you want
from Joel Graves?

34:09.214 --> 34:10.414
I want him in here.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.082
You know, what I think
you really want.

34:12.084 --> 34:15.185
What you really want, you
know he can't give it to you.

34:15.187 --> 34:17.120
You know he can't bring it back.

34:17.122 --> 34:18.388
Lou, you got to hurry.

34:18.390 --> 34:19.556
You got to hurry, Lou.

34:19.558 --> 34:21.158
Okay. Copy. On our way.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.794
Don't try to stop me.

34:23.796 --> 34:26.163
I owe this.

34:26.165 --> 34:28.365
I owe this to Carol.

34:28.367 --> 34:29.533
To Carol?

34:29.535 --> 34:31.568
Stan's wife, recession suicide.

34:31.570 --> 34:34.204
He found her in the garage.

34:34.206 --> 34:37.207
She had her good coat on.

34:37.209 --> 34:40.277
Her good coat,
like she was going somewhere.

34:40.279 --> 34:41.745
She left a note
on the hood of the car,

34:41.747 --> 34:45.315
'cause she couldn't tell him.

34:45.317 --> 34:49.286
She thought she let him down.

34:49.288 --> 34:51.254
I hear you.

34:51.256 --> 34:52.622
That's not right.

34:52.624 --> 34:53.790
That's not right.

34:53.792 --> 34:55.158
Yeah, it's not right.

34:55.160 --> 34:56.626
It's not right.

34:56.628 --> 34:57.794
You hear me?

34:57.796 --> 34:59.162
You get it?

34:59.164 --> 35:00.330
Then you let me through.

35:00.332 --> 35:01.698
Now listen to me, Brian.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.267
In this job, I hear
a lot of people

35:04.269 --> 35:05.802
asking for a lot
of crazy things.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.671
and what you're asking for,
it's not crazy.

35:07.673 --> 35:10.474
It's not.

35:10.476 --> 35:12.609
It's just not something...

35:12.611 --> 35:16.346
It's not something
that we can do, okay?

35:16.348 --> 35:19.149
We can't do it
like this.

35:19.151 --> 35:20.250
No, I get it.

35:20.252 --> 35:21.618
I get it.

35:21.620 --> 35:24.187
You just... You just want
to do right by your friends.

35:24.189 --> 35:26.189
You just want
to do right by Stan.

35:26.191 --> 35:29.659
Brian, Stan is down there
right now,

35:29.661 --> 35:34.364
dousing gasoline,
with a lighter,

35:34.366 --> 35:35.632
and he's going
to light himself on fire.

35:35.634 --> 35:37.667
No. No.

35:37.669 --> 35:40.237
Now, I know
you've lost a lot,

35:40.239 --> 35:43.140
but you don't want
to lose Stan, too.

35:43.142 --> 35:46.376
So I'm asking you,

35:46.378 --> 35:49.646
show him that
this isn't the way.

35:49.648 --> 35:52.649
Just show him that there
is another way to end this.

35:52.651 --> 35:54.351
Okay?

35:54.353 --> 35:56.686
Please?

36:01.360 --> 36:03.460
Please.

36:05.631 --> 36:07.397
Thank you.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.767
Weapon's down.
Weapon's down.

36:10.769 --> 36:11.935
Thank you.

36:11.937 --> 36:13.703
Thanks.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.777
And I know, and I know how hard
it is to lose someone,

36:20.779 --> 36:22.412
to lose someone you love,

36:22.414 --> 36:24.381
to lose something
that's so important to you

36:24.383 --> 36:25.849
and have it ripped
out of your life. I know.

36:25.850 --> 36:27.316
You got ten seconds.
This isn't the way, Stan.

36:27.319 --> 36:28.285
Nine.
It's not the way.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.554
Your friends know that.
Eight.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.322
Your friends know
when it's time to stop.

36:32.324 --> 36:34.925
You get him in here,

36:34.927 --> 36:36.326
or this ends right now.

36:36.328 --> 36:38.929
Just don't do it, Stan.

36:38.931 --> 36:40.764
Just don't do it.

36:40.766 --> 36:42.766
(handcuffs snap shut)

36:42.768 --> 36:44.734
Thank you.
You did the right thing.

36:46.572 --> 36:48.405
ED:
You did the right thing.

36:54.913 --> 36:56.980
Mr. Graves.
Hi.

36:56.982 --> 36:58.315
What do you have to tell us
about today?

36:58.317 --> 37:00.951
Hi, uh, I'm Joel Graves, and...

37:00.953 --> 37:02.586
in response to today's events,

37:02.588 --> 37:04.654
I'd just like to say
a few words. Um...

37:04.656 --> 37:08.325
I'm moved by the losses
of these men.

37:08.327 --> 37:09.626
Eddie.

37:09.628 --> 37:10.961
(cameras clicking)

37:10.963 --> 37:13.463
And I understand the need

37:13.465 --> 37:16.766
to turn to someone
for an explanation.

37:16.768 --> 37:18.235
What these men lost was more

37:18.237 --> 37:19.836
than four walls and a roof.

37:19.838 --> 37:22.572
But that's the part
that I took from them.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.441
It made sense on paper,

37:24.443 --> 37:27.410
but up close,
it's a different story.

37:27.412 --> 37:28.578
All right.
Let's go.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.313
And up close,

37:30.315 --> 37:32.582
it's not the same.

37:32.584 --> 37:34.417
I'm sorry.

37:35.654 --> 37:36.987
Stan, I'm sorry.

37:36.989 --> 37:39.556
If there is anything
I can do to help...

37:39.558 --> 37:41.324
Thank you.

37:41.326 --> 37:43.460
(reporters clamoring)

37:48.400 --> 37:49.532
Well, he got up there.

37:49.534 --> 37:52.435
Came clean,
said he was sorry.

37:52.437 --> 37:53.837
That's what you wanted, right?

37:53.839 --> 37:56.306
It's not enough.

37:56.308 --> 37:58.592
I know.

37:58.593 --> 38:00.877
I know nothing's going
to take that pain away.

38:00.879 --> 38:02.345
Now he wants to help?

38:02.347 --> 38:06.516
How's he going
to do that?

38:06.518 --> 38:11.054
Being sorry gets him
off the hook?

38:11.056 --> 38:13.423
"I want to help,"

38:13.425 --> 38:15.392
makes things better?

38:15.394 --> 38:19.029
What's he gonna do?

38:19.031 --> 38:22.899
Is he in the business
of giving back lives?

38:26.505 --> 38:28.438
What about my wife?

38:30.676 --> 38:32.475
Just don't do it, Stan.

38:32.477 --> 38:33.543
Just don't.

38:33.545 --> 38:34.611
Ready, Sarge.

38:34.613 --> 38:36.346
Go.

38:50.662 --> 38:54.564
(sobbing)

38:54.566 --> 38:56.900
Carol.

38:56.902 --> 38:59.936
(sobbing)

38:59.938 --> 39:01.504
Carol. Carol.

39:02.941 --> 39:04.474
12:16 pm,

39:04.476 --> 39:08.411
third subject
Stan Matthews contained.

39:08.413 --> 39:09.713
(computer beeps)

39:14.886 --> 39:17.120
You know what? She blew
by everybody in there.

39:17.122 --> 39:19.522
Nobody could touch her,
Greg, nobody.

39:19.524 --> 39:20.690
So, what's the problem?

39:20.692 --> 39:21.958
You don't think
she'll work?

39:21.960 --> 39:24.361
You don't want
to let Jules go?

39:24.363 --> 39:25.562
(sighs)

39:27.566 --> 39:29.866
(chuckling)

39:35.374 --> 39:38.108
Constable Sabine.

39:38.110 --> 39:40.377
Sit down.

39:40.379 --> 39:42.512
Good call today?

39:42.514 --> 39:46.049
Well, no one died.

39:54.526 --> 39:58.461
This guy wanted to die today,
but he didn't get to.

39:58.463 --> 40:00.597
This other guy,
he's got a family

40:00.599 --> 40:01.831
that's going to go
without a father

40:01.833 --> 40:02.999
for a while.

40:03.001 --> 40:04.601
This guy's going to jail,

40:04.603 --> 40:06.119
'cause all he wanted

40:06.120 --> 40:07.636
to do was help out
his two friends.
I get it.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.472
Yeah?

40:09.474 --> 40:11.841
It's not black and white.

40:18.116 --> 40:20.717
Everyone's a constable here.

40:20.719 --> 40:22.519
There's no rising up
in the ranks.

40:22.521 --> 40:24.754
You don't make more money 'cause
you risk your life every day.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.089
You make less.
I know.

40:26.091 --> 40:29.092
You're not going to be
out in the field alone.

40:29.094 --> 40:31.027
You're going to be
in it with a team.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.595
I'm not going
to lie to you.

40:32.597 --> 40:35.598
If Jules makes it back,
she's got a place here.

40:35.600 --> 40:36.566
Fair.

40:36.568 --> 40:37.700
But that doesn't mean

40:37.702 --> 40:39.569
I won't put my faith in you.

40:39.571 --> 40:42.572
I'm not going to let you down.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.178
Okay.

40:48.180 --> 40:50.213
Yeah? Okay?

40:50.215 --> 40:52.682
Yeah, let's keep the peace.

40:52.684 --> 40:55.985
Okay, let's do that.
Hmm.

40:55.987 --> 40:57.587
Thank you.

40:57.589 --> 40:58.755
You're welcome.

40:58.757 --> 41:01.825
¶ Are you waiting
for a miracle? ¶

41:05.564 --> 41:10.567
¶ Are you waiting
for a lightning bolt? ¶

41:13.905 --> 41:19.609
¶ Are you waiting
like a paranoid... ¶

41:19.611 --> 41:22.679
¶ Little boy? ¶

41:22.681 --> 41:26.783
¶ Are you ever gonna
come back home? ¶

41:26.785 --> 41:28.618
When did you
get divorced?

41:30.622 --> 41:34.991
¶ Do you believe that
the sky is falling? ¶

41:39.097 --> 41:43.867
¶ How you ever gonna
pick up the pieces? ¶

41:47.038 --> 41:51.975
¶ Do you really think
that anybody will listen? ¶

41:55.580 --> 42:02.185
¶ Do you really think
that anybody will notice? ¶
