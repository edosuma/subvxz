11:03.085 --> 11:06.129
- I think this has something
to do with the gardener.
- You think?

11:06.213 --> 11:10.133
<i>- Just down the hall to the right.
- Ay. Gracias, gracias.</i>

11:10.259 --> 11:12.928

In there. Okay.

11:13.011 --> 11:15.180
- Okay, let's go.
- No, please.

11:15.264 --> 11:17.944
I know it's killing you not to get
back there in the middle of that.

11:18.016 --> 11:21.562
Oh, no, no, no, no. We are going.
These folks can find their own way out.

11:21.645 --> 11:25.941
And now you'll know that I'm not a manic
Mother Teresa out there collecting lost souls.

- Didn't you get the message? He's not going.

- What?
- Ah, some mandatory
cleanup at school.

11:42.124 --> 11:45.377
- What's the real reason?
- It's a puppet show, Mitch.

11:45.460 --> 11:48.755
Perfect. All right, it's just
you and me then, Lin.

11:48.881 --> 11:52.217
How's the little fortune cookie?
Ah, she—she's good. She's good.

11:52.342 --> 11:55.721
Where's Cam?
We got into a fight.

11:55.804 --> 11:58.140
Because of him, I have
a house full of Latinos.

11:58.223 --> 12:01.643
Welcome to my world.
So, trouble in gay paradise, huh?

12:01.727 --> 12:04.354
<i>He just can't say no
to anybody who needs help.</i>

12:04.438 --> 12:07.250
And why do you have to always add
the word “gay” where it doesn't belong?

12:07.274 --> 12:10.277
<i>Hey, hey, you To not mad at me.
You're mad at the old balls and chain.</i>

12:10.360 --> 12:12.279
Okay, Dad, good talk.
See you later.

12:12.362 --> 12:15.616
Come on, I didn't mean it. Hey, I
didn't mean it. I'm a little cranky.

12:15.741 --> 12:18.410
I got into it with Gloria a little
bit. Oh, no. What happened?

12:18.493 --> 12:22.915
Ah, she hates Barkley. It's the same stuff
I went over with your mom all the time.

12:22.998 --> 12:27.085
“Get rid of the boat.” “Get rid of the
motorcycle.” You know, I liked those things.

12:27.169 --> 12:29.463
Why do you have to
get rid of it then?

12:30.505 --> 12:33.258
You know, actually, I don't.

12:33.342 --> 12:36.762
Anyway, I'm gluing his hand
on over here. His hand came off.

12:36.845 --> 12:40.057
Rough day, Dad. Your hot,
young wife doesn't like your doll.

12:40.140 --> 12:43.769
Yeah, unlike your big problem,
“My boyfriend's too nice to people.”

12:43.852 --> 12:46.229
No, see— mmm—
That's not all it is.

12:46.313 --> 12:50.442
He helps animals. He's always
volunteering for things. Trust me.

<i>It-It's worse than it sounds.</i>

12:52.527 --> 12:55.113
Who are we kidding?
We both got it pretty good.

12:55.197 --> 12:58.760
Hell, I'm probably fighting with your mom more
than I'm fighting with Gloria on this thing.

12:58.784 --> 13:01.662
A bird fell out of a tree and
he fed it with an eyedropper.

13:01.745 --> 13:04.706
<i>Just drop it, kid. We're both
with people different from us,</i>

13:04.790 --> 13:07.626

<i>Your mom and I were perfect on paper
and you know how that ended.</i>

13:11.630 --> 13:15.467

sometimes even I can't believe we're together.

See you, kid.

13:42.869 --> 13:45.330
Did you draw on my poster?

13:45.414 --> 13:49.459
Yeah, I did. Maybe you'll think about
that the next time you read my journal.

13:49.584 --> 13:54.006
I didn't read your stupid journal, and I
waited in line to get this signed, Haley.

Well, I just heard...

14:15.527 --> 14:17.946
I was the one
who read Haley's diary.

14:18.030 --> 14:20.574
I was playing on her computer
and it just opened.

14:22.617 --> 14:26.747
Okay, I opened it. But I
didn't mean for anyone to fight.

No. You know, I was never gonna

Oh. But you were so excited to take
Lily to see the Russian marionettes.

14:39.843 --> 14:41.511
Oh, she's probably
a little young anyway.

14:41.595 --> 14:44.097
We can just prop her in front

Listen, Cam, I-I love that

you in my life. Oh, Mitchell.

How'd everything work out with
the gardener? Uh, great. Great.

14:54.399 --> 14:56.711
Turned out it was his wedding day,
and he was a little nervous.

14:56.735 --> 14:59.029
Oh— But you know what?
There's no need to apologize.

14:59.112 --> 15:00.739
No, I need to.
I've been very selfish.

15:00.822 --> 15:03.075
No, no. Sometimes
I take things too far.

Okay. If that ever happens,
I will let you know. Okay.

Okay. Well, it's perfectly normal

Mm-hmm.
