01:19.513 --> 01:21.246
skipper,
give me a hand
here, will you?

01:21.314 --> 01:22.447
Yeah, sure, professor.

01:22.516 --> 01:23.448
This is
a wonderful way

01:23.517 --> 01:24.415
to protect our
food supply.

01:24.484 --> 01:26.051
It'll be cool
down there.

01:26.119 --> 01:27.152
Yeah, gilligan
promoted

01:27.221 --> 01:28.453
a steamer trunk
from the howells.

01:28.522 --> 01:29.888
Figures he'll put
all the food in it

01:29.957 --> 01:31.456
and drop the whole thing
in the pit.

01:31.525 --> 01:32.724
Ah, it's
a wonderful idea.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.259
You two men deserve
a lot of credit.

01:34.327 --> 01:36.194
Oh, I can't take any bows
this time, professor.

01:36.263 --> 01:37.662
These are all
gilligan's decisions.

01:37.731 --> 01:38.664
All except one.

01:38.732 --> 01:39.898
What was that?

01:39.967 --> 01:42.467
He decided I could
do the digging.

01:42.536 --> 01:44.669
Okay, gilligan,
I'll relieve you.

01:44.738 --> 01:46.405
Come on.

01:47.040 --> 01:48.173
Ohh.

01:48.242 --> 01:50.074
Oh, my back! My back!

01:50.143 --> 01:51.476
Well, what's
the matter, can't
you straighten up?

01:51.545 --> 01:53.144
No, I'm stuck.
I'm stuck.

01:53.213 --> 01:55.480
Gilligan, you've
just got a cramp.
I'll fix that.

01:55.549 --> 01:56.949
Careful,
skipper.

01:57.017 --> 01:58.750
Don't worry, professor,
I've done this before.

01:58.819 --> 02:00.485
[Loud crack]

02:00.554 --> 02:02.420
Gosh, little buddy,
did I hurt you?

02:02.489 --> 02:05.657
No, skipper.
I had some seashells
in my back pockets.

02:06.826 --> 02:09.461
Oh, I'll dig awhile.

02:11.531 --> 02:13.631
Professor, get
gilligan to help you.

02:13.700 --> 02:15.767
Yeah. Get me
one of those,
uh, bamboo rods,

02:15.836 --> 02:17.302
will you,
gilligan?

02:19.073 --> 02:20.938
No, no, no.
A short one.
A short one.

02:21.007 --> 02:22.908
Oh.

02:24.077 --> 02:25.577
Like that.

02:29.283 --> 02:30.649
Professor!

02:30.718 --> 02:31.884
Gilligan!

02:36.456 --> 02:38.723
Look what
i just dug up.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.792
Professor: Why,
it's one of those
ancient tiki gods.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.460
Right.
It's kona.

02:42.529 --> 02:44.629
Kona?
The god of evil.

02:44.697 --> 02:46.631
This must be
his ancient burial place.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.234
Whoever disturbs his rest
is cursed forever.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.535
Thanks for taking over
the digging, skipper.

02:50.604 --> 02:51.703
Now, look, you
don't believe

02:51.771 --> 02:53.038
these native
superstitions,
do you?

02:53.106 --> 02:54.806
He sure does,
professor.

02:54.875 --> 02:56.074
He's always telling me
terrible stories about
these islands,

02:56.142 --> 02:57.742
sacred gods
and curses.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.310
Surely you don't
believe in that
nonsense, gilligan.

02:59.379 --> 03:01.212
Surely I don't,
but I do.

03:01.281 --> 03:02.848
Professor, you'd
believe it, too

03:02.917 --> 03:04.249
if you'd seen some
of the strange things
I've seen.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.216
Well, if you're
both afraid,

03:05.285 --> 03:06.217
I'll take over
the digging.

03:06.286 --> 03:08.053
You're welcome to it.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.255
[Rumbling]

03:24.638 --> 03:27.138
Superstitions, eh?
It's the curse of kona,

03:27.207 --> 03:28.239
and it's just
the beginning.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.775
Skipper,
little earthquakes

03:29.843 --> 03:31.343
are not
uncommon on these
volcanic islands.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.610
The underground
gases exert pressure

03:32.679 --> 03:34.146
on the substrata
formations,

03:34.214 --> 03:36.481
causing shifts
in the geological
striations.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.049
Skipper, I agree.

03:38.118 --> 03:40.318
Gilligan, how could you agree?
Did you understand what he said?

03:40.387 --> 03:41.953
No, but it's
the way he says it.

03:42.022 --> 03:43.387
Professor,
we've got to ward off
these evil spirits.

03:43.456 --> 03:44.989
I've got some charms
in the hut that may--

03:45.058 --> 03:47.459
now, look,
skipper, this is the
twentieth century,

03:47.528 --> 03:49.027
and there is
absolutely no
scientific evidence

03:49.096 --> 03:51.596
to support any of
this superstitious
nonsense.

03:51.664 --> 03:53.164
Now, let's
forget all about
the curse of kona

03:53.233 --> 03:54.799
and get back
to digging that pit
for our food.

03:54.868 --> 03:56.201
Well, but i--

03:56.270 --> 03:57.836
alright, alright,
I'll do the digging.

03:57.905 --> 03:59.471
You and gilligan
go get some more
logs for supports.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.139
Come on, skipper.
Maybe he's right, huh?

04:01.208 --> 04:02.640
Okay, but--

04:02.709 --> 04:03.976
ooh!

04:04.044 --> 04:05.977
Skipper,
are you alright?

04:06.046 --> 04:07.445
It's another warning
from kona.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.481
That's not a warning,
skipper, it's an accident,

04:09.550 --> 04:11.149
the kind of accident
that occurs

04:11.218 --> 04:13.852
with predictable
regularity and
statistical frequency.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.954
Skipper.
Gilligan.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.189
It's the way
he says it.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.757
Let's go get
some logs.

04:18.825 --> 04:21.260
Boy, you sure
got a mouth full
of big words.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.499
Well, I sure hope this
makes you feel better.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.500
Gilligan, I'll
feel a lot better

04:29.569 --> 04:31.737
when kona's
in his original
burial place.

04:35.542 --> 04:36.974
Isn't that
deep enough yet?

04:37.043 --> 04:38.376
No, I'm gonna
make it just
a little deeper.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.044
I don't want to take
any chances.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.713
Seems like
an awful lot of trouble
for a little statue.

04:41.782 --> 04:43.915
It's a lot
of trouble, but
it's worth it.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.850
Did you hear
that, lovey?

04:45.919 --> 04:47.786
That statue
must be worth
a fortune.

04:47.854 --> 04:50.055
That's probably why
they're burying it.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.956
There's only
one thing to do.

04:52.025 --> 04:53.158
Tell the professor?

04:53.226 --> 04:55.794
No. Take it
ourselves.

04:59.266 --> 05:01.433
Rest quietly, kona.

05:14.214 --> 05:15.547
Ahh. There.

05:15.616 --> 05:16.748
That's a load
off my mind.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.416
We'll put the food locker
right on top.

05:18.485 --> 05:19.784
Exactly, gilligan.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.285
Let's get going before
the professor gets back.

05:21.354 --> 05:23.555
Yes. He'll
never understand.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.699
Thurston,
please hurry.

05:34.767 --> 05:37.636
Good heavens, lovey,
how do you work
one of these?

05:43.310 --> 05:44.309
Nothing
to worry about now.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.377
It's--it's hidden.

05:45.445 --> 05:46.778
Yes, but, thurston,
what happens

05:46.847 --> 05:48.546
when gilligan
and the skipper
find it missing?

05:48.615 --> 05:50.548
Simple. We just accuse
the professor.

05:50.617 --> 05:53.919
Oh, thurston.
Just joking, my dear.

06:01.661 --> 06:03.494
I wonder if
they're home?

06:03.563 --> 06:05.263
Anybody there?

06:05.331 --> 06:06.464
Anybody there?

06:06.533 --> 06:07.799
I just said that,
gilligan.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.601
Well, they should
be back soon.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.236
It's getting dark.
Maybe we should wait.

06:11.305 --> 06:12.837
Wait?
Why should we wait?

06:12.906 --> 06:14.539
All we did
was come over to get
the steamer trunk,

06:14.608 --> 06:16.274
and they said we
could pick that up
anytime.

06:16.342 --> 06:17.576
Ha ha ha.

06:18.645 --> 06:20.912
There it is,
gilligan.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.751
Let's get it
out of here.

06:29.857 --> 06:31.656
Well, I guess the howells
haven't unpacked it yet.

06:31.724 --> 06:33.324
Well, let's empty it out.

06:33.393 --> 06:34.926
Oh, look,
it's locked.

06:34.994 --> 06:37.395
Well, there's gotta
be a key around here
someplace.

06:37.464 --> 06:39.965
Let's start
looking for it.

06:43.303 --> 06:44.803
Gilligan.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.092
I don't believe it.

07:10.830 --> 07:13.565
Uhh. I do believe it.

07:13.633 --> 07:15.767
What is it, skipper?

07:15.835 --> 07:17.803
Gilligan,
look in there.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.006
How'd it get
back here?

07:22.075 --> 07:23.441
I knew it.
I knew it.

07:23.510 --> 07:25.009
It's the curse of kona.

07:25.078 --> 07:26.077
Maybe you're right.

07:26.146 --> 07:28.513
Oh, of course I'm right.
It's following me.

07:28.581 --> 07:30.047
Gilligan, you've
got to bury it.

07:30.116 --> 07:31.382
Why me?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.551
Well, I'm the one
that has the curse
of kona upon him.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.520
Maybe if you bury it,
it'll go away.

07:35.588 --> 07:37.189
Do I have to?

07:37.257 --> 07:39.558
Please, gilligan,
little buddy.

07:39.626 --> 07:41.226
Okay, skipper.

07:43.063 --> 07:44.496
What's the matter?

07:44.564 --> 07:46.264
I don't like
the way he looks at me
with those big eyes.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.965
Gilligan.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.634
Skipper.

08:02.081 --> 08:03.615
[Rumbling]

08:09.589 --> 08:11.356
Stop it, will you?
I'm not afraid of you.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.324
I don't believe
in your curse.

08:13.393 --> 08:14.726
Look, I didn't dig you up

08:14.795 --> 08:16.828
and I'm putting you
back where you belong.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.563
Stop staring at me,
will you?

08:18.632 --> 08:19.998
I got a good mind
to throw you in the ocean.

08:20.066 --> 08:21.132
[Thunder]

08:21.200 --> 08:22.533
But I won't, I won't.

08:22.602 --> 08:25.604
I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.206
I'm afraid!

08:29.275 --> 08:30.742
I'm afraid--afraid!

08:33.446 --> 08:35.479
Did you do it?
Yeah, yeah.

08:35.548 --> 08:36.914
Well, did you bury him
in the right place?

08:36.982 --> 08:38.916
Well, kind of.
What do you mean, "kind of"?

08:38.985 --> 08:40.918
Well, it's close enough.
Well, next to the pit?

08:40.986 --> 08:43.188
Well, it's
sort of kind of
next to the pit.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.989
Gilligan,
did you bury kona,
or did you not?

08:45.058 --> 08:46.824
Well, he's better
than buried. He's lost.

08:46.893 --> 08:49.560
Lost? You mean
you didn't bury him?

08:49.629 --> 08:50.862
Gilligan, how could you
let me down like this?

08:50.931 --> 08:52.197
I'm sorry, skipper,
but I was scared.

08:52.265 --> 08:54.165
Well, where is he?
He's out there somewhere.

08:54.233 --> 08:55.833
I just threw him and ran.
Just threw him and ran?

08:55.902 --> 08:57.701
Gilligan,
you've got to show me
where you threw him.

08:57.770 --> 08:59.637
Come on, gilligan.
Show me!

08:59.705 --> 09:00.805
We'd better take this.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.674
Oh, never mind that,
gilligan.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.810
Which way did you say,
gilligan? Ooh!

09:07.614 --> 09:09.814
Sorry, skipper.
I'm sorry.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.082
I was just tying
my shoelace.

09:11.151 --> 09:14.218
My shoe was untied,
skipper, so--

09:14.287 --> 09:15.486
[sighs]

09:15.555 --> 09:17.388
Alright, gilligan.

09:17.457 --> 09:20.358
I know your shoe
was untied.

09:20.427 --> 09:21.726
Now, which way
did you say?

09:21.795 --> 09:23.428
The left, skipper. Here. I'll
lead. I'll show you.

09:23.497 --> 09:24.628
No. I shall lead.

09:24.697 --> 09:26.031
You've done enough
for today.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.766
Thank you, gilligan.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.837
[Glub]
Whoa!

09:32.906 --> 09:35.573
Gilligan!
Help! Gilligan!

09:35.641 --> 09:37.208
Skipper, what are you
doin' in there?

09:37.277 --> 09:39.210
Stay back, gilligan!
It's quicksand!

09:39.279 --> 09:40.812
Here. Can you reach me?

09:40.881 --> 09:42.814
Ugh! Argh! No,
i can't reach you!

09:42.883 --> 09:44.816
Gilligan, you know
what's happening?

09:44.885 --> 09:46.150
Yeah. You're sinking.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.285
It's the will of kona.
I'm doomed!

09:48.354 --> 09:50.421
I'll go find the statue
and bury it. You'll be okay.

09:50.490 --> 09:51.756
Gilligan,
come back here!

09:51.825 --> 09:53.824
By the time you bury it, I'll
be buried!

09:53.893 --> 09:55.660
Do something.
Don't just stand there!

09:55.729 --> 09:57.262
I'll get some vines.
Stay where you are.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.796
Yeah. Just--gilligan!

09:58.865 --> 10:00.197
Save me! Hurry up!

10:00.266 --> 10:02.033
Stay right where
you are, skipper.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.501
Don't panic.

10:03.569 --> 10:05.670
I'm almost under. Help me!

10:05.739 --> 10:07.138
I'll get you out,
skipper.

10:07.207 --> 10:08.773
Hold your breath,
skipper.

10:15.014 --> 10:16.748
I'll be right there,
skipper.

10:21.854 --> 10:24.589
Don't worry, skipper.
I'm comin'!

10:24.658 --> 10:27.792
Wait a minute, skipper.
Here I come, skipper.

10:28.962 --> 10:32.230
Here I come.
Skipper?

10:32.298 --> 10:35.000
Thank goodness you
finally touched bottom!
I'll get you out!

10:35.068 --> 10:36.801
Can you hold your breath
a little longer?

10:36.870 --> 10:38.035
Okay, gilligan.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.471
These vines
got all tangled.

10:40.539 --> 10:41.673
I'm alright,
gilligan.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.341
I'll get you out
in a second.

10:43.410 --> 10:45.409
Gilligan...

10:45.478 --> 10:46.845
Look, not now. I'm busy.

10:46.913 --> 10:47.845
I gotta get the skipper
out of the quicksand.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.614
Gilligan--
look, I told you

10:49.682 --> 10:51.415
I'm busy. My friend
is down--

10:51.484 --> 10:52.650
[sighs]

10:52.719 --> 10:54.485
Oh. Hi, skipper.
You got out, huh?

10:54.554 --> 10:55.619
It won't make any difference.

10:55.688 --> 10:57.522
Kona's gonna get me
sooner or later.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.890
And we looked for kona
all day and all night
and couldn't find him.

10:59.959 --> 11:01.525
Skipper sure is depressed.

11:01.594 --> 11:03.728
Yeah. I wish
we could find a way
to cheer him up.

11:03.796 --> 11:06.197
I know. Let's give him
a surprise birthday party.

11:06.265 --> 11:08.333
Hey, that's a great idea.
When's his birthday?

11:08.402 --> 11:09.867
Last month.
Last month?

11:09.936 --> 11:12.103
Yeah. It'll be
a big surprise.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.406
You know, you may have
something, gilligan.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.307
Look at this.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.342
Ginger, look
what I found.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.977
What is it?

11:20.046 --> 11:22.413
Ooh, it's some kind
of native carving.

11:22.482 --> 11:23.481
Let's show it
to the skipper.

11:23.549 --> 11:24.415
I'll bet he'll know
what it is.

11:24.484 --> 11:25.883
Wait a minute.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.186
This'll be our present.

11:28.255 --> 11:31.055
What a great idea.
Boy, will he be surprised.

11:31.124 --> 11:34.024
¶ For he's
a jolly good fellow ¶

11:34.093 --> 11:36.360
¶ for he's
a jolly good fellow ¶

11:36.429 --> 11:39.731
¶ for he's
a jolly good fellow ¶

11:39.799 --> 11:41.265
¶ which nobody can deny ¶

11:41.334 --> 11:42.634
hey!

11:42.702 --> 11:44.235
Feel better, skipper?

11:44.303 --> 11:46.103
Thanks to all of you,
i feel just fine.

11:46.172 --> 11:48.473
I salute every one
of you.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.274
Did you like the cake?
Oh, it was wonderful.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.177
Well, it must have been.
He ate half of it.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.379
Alright, skipper.
Time to open your presents.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.648
That's from me.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.949
Gee, professor.

11:59.018 --> 12:03.153
Oh...Thanks a lot.
I can't thank you enough.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.822
Oh, something
I've always wanted:

12:04.891 --> 12:07.325
<i> "The history</i>
<i> of tree surgery."</i>

12:07.393 --> 12:08.893
One of my favorites.

12:08.962 --> 12:11.162
Well, I'll let everybody
read it after I'm
through with it.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.298
But don't
tell us the ending.
I love suspense.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.466
This one's from me.
I hope you like it.

12:15.535 --> 12:16.700
Oh, gilligan.

12:16.769 --> 12:19.704
You shouldn't have.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.206
Ha ha!

12:24.277 --> 12:25.643
You shouldn't have,
gilligan.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.211
That's your favorite
pocket knife.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.713
You've been
carrying it for years.

12:28.782 --> 12:30.214
How come you're
giving it to me?

12:30.283 --> 12:31.916
It's broken.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.852
Here you are, skipper. A little
gift for your birthday.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.454
Mr. and Mrs. howell.

12:38.391 --> 12:40.891
Looks like a gold earring.
Lovey: It is.

12:40.960 --> 12:43.894
I think every sea captain
should look like a pirate.

12:43.963 --> 12:45.763
Be sure and wear it
with basic black.

12:45.832 --> 12:48.732
Why, certainly, Mr. howell.

12:48.801 --> 12:51.969
Gee, I think this
is the nicest birthday party
i ever had.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.638
You forgot
our present, skipper.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.306
Here.
You'll love it.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.309
Thanks, girls.
Thanks, gilligan.

12:58.378 --> 13:01.045
I just want to say
thanks very much.

13:01.114 --> 13:04.915
I know I was kind of feeling
very sorry for myself
and pretty low

13:04.984 --> 13:08.219
but, well, it was silly
of me to take that stuff
so seriously, and i--

13:08.288 --> 13:13.057
well, thanks to all of you,
i--i think everything's
gonna be just fine.

13:13.693 --> 13:14.825
Kona!

13:14.894 --> 13:16.327
Kona! Kona!

13:16.395 --> 13:17.361
Aah! Kona!

13:17.430 --> 13:19.531
Kona!

13:32.045 --> 13:33.277
Here you are.

13:33.346 --> 13:36.481
I've been looking
all over for you.

13:36.550 --> 13:37.748
Why don't you
just ask kona?

13:37.817 --> 13:39.250
He knows where I am
all the time.

13:39.319 --> 13:42.486
Oh, stop it. You should
be ashamed of yourself.

13:42.555 --> 13:43.987
You can't quit now.

13:44.056 --> 13:47.024
I'm not quitting now,
i quit 3 hours ago.

13:47.092 --> 13:49.327
Oh, the way you talk.

13:49.395 --> 13:51.162
It's the way I feel.

13:51.230 --> 13:52.664
You know what I think?

13:52.732 --> 13:54.331
I think that
you're forgetting

13:54.400 --> 13:58.970
about the 6 people
on this island
who really love you.

13:59.038 --> 14:02.841
If I could just forget
about that one little guy
on this island that hates me.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.613
Thanks for helping me
bury the statue,
professor.

14:08.682 --> 14:10.214
There. I guess
that's deep enough.

14:10.282 --> 14:11.815
A little bit deeper,
huh?

14:11.884 --> 14:13.551
I want him
down there so deep
he'll get the bends.

14:13.619 --> 14:15.786
Gilligan,
that statue can't possibly
get out of this pit.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.154
I don't know, professor.

14:17.223 --> 14:18.789
Every time I throw him
away, he comes back.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.157
I think
the little devil's
got boomerang blood.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.226
Gilligan, put it
in the pit.

14:22.295 --> 14:24.328
A little bit deeper,
please?

14:24.397 --> 14:26.330
[Sighs]

14:26.399 --> 14:28.899
Oh, why, you're
the kind of man

14:28.968 --> 14:31.735
that any young,
attractive girl

14:31.804 --> 14:34.638
would love
to spend the rest
of her life with.

14:34.707 --> 14:39.611
Why, you're--you're
lots of things, skipper.

14:39.679 --> 14:44.215
Yes, and I'm doomed,
I'm scared, and I'm through.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.953
Let's cover up that statue
so no one will ever find it.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.188
Right.

15:01.467 --> 15:02.800
Aah!

15:02.869 --> 15:05.736
Aah! Aah! Oh!

15:05.805 --> 15:07.471
Skipper, look out
for that...

15:07.540 --> 15:09.240
[Whack]

15:09.309 --> 15:10.375
Tree.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.576
Oh...

15:12.645 --> 15:13.677
My head.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.479
Ah!

15:15.548 --> 15:17.148
Oh...

15:17.217 --> 15:18.615
Well, his pulse
seems to be normal.

15:18.684 --> 15:20.117
It's no use, professor.

15:20.186 --> 15:21.652
There's nothing
you can do for me.

15:21.721 --> 15:23.020
I'm a doomed man.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.422
Skipper, you just hit
your head on a tree.

15:24.491 --> 15:25.722
You'll be alright.

15:25.791 --> 15:28.526
Oh, gilligan,
i keep telling you
it's the will of kona.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.863
You just won't believe me.
Oh! My head!

15:31.931 --> 15:33.264
Isn't there anything
we can do?

15:33.332 --> 15:35.299
He'll just have
a bad headache,
that's all.

15:35.368 --> 15:36.868
My grandmother
always used to say,

15:36.936 --> 15:38.168
"starve a cold
and feed a fever."

15:38.237 --> 15:39.837
Gilligan, he's got
a bump on the head.

15:39.906 --> 15:41.706
He doesn't have a cold,
and he doesn't
have a fever.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.708
I know,
but if he gets them,
we'll be ready.

15:43.777 --> 15:44.975
Let's let him
rest a while.

15:45.044 --> 15:46.110
You watch him,
gilligan.

15:46.179 --> 15:48.612
Come on,
Mary Ann.

15:48.681 --> 15:50.314
Mind if we come in?

15:50.383 --> 15:52.016
We've been out in
the waiting room
for quite a while.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.685
Alright, but
don't stay too long.

15:55.521 --> 15:58.022
Well, old fella,
you look pretty chipper

15:58.091 --> 16:00.457
for someone who's
cracked his little head
wide open.

16:00.526 --> 16:02.993
Oh! Ah!

16:03.062 --> 16:04.929
Thurston, you'll
frighten him.

16:04.998 --> 16:06.097
You shouldn't
talk like that

16:06.165 --> 16:08.032
to someone
who's so
desperately ill.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.101
Come on, folks.
Let the skipper
sleep.

16:11.170 --> 16:14.004
Well, alright.
But he'll never recover
if you Molly-coddle him.

16:14.073 --> 16:16.473
Mr. howell, have you
seen the bruise on
the skipper's head?

16:16.542 --> 16:19.176
Have you seen the bruise
on that tree? It's horrifying.

16:19.245 --> 16:20.777
You ought to notify
smokey the bear.

16:20.846 --> 16:22.547
Come along.
Bye.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.349
Don't worry, skipper.
You'll be alright.

16:25.418 --> 16:26.884
It's useless. It's useless.

16:26.953 --> 16:29.453
The only one
who can save me
is watubi.

16:29.522 --> 16:30.588
Only watubi!

16:30.656 --> 16:33.591
Watubi? Who's he?
The ancient witch doctor.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.926
He's the only one
who can lift the curse
of kona off me.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.527
Watubi! Watubi!

16:37.596 --> 16:40.431
Skipper,
watubi is just more
native superstition.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.766
Watubi
doesn't exist.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.067
Watubi! Watubi!

16:44.136 --> 16:45.736
Is he alright?

16:45.805 --> 16:47.438
It's his mental
attitude, gilligan.
He's giving up.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.672
He hasn't got
the will to go on.

16:48.741 --> 16:49.740
Just because
he's so superstitious?

16:49.809 --> 16:51.108
I'm afraid so.

16:51.177 --> 16:52.976
It's plain fear, gilligan,
just plain fear.

16:53.045 --> 16:54.211
Why, if he doesn't
snap out of it,

16:54.280 --> 16:55.612
he can talk himself
into anything.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.181
Oh.

17:20.973 --> 17:22.339
[Sighs]

17:23.041 --> 17:25.041
Gilligan.

17:25.109 --> 17:27.176
Gilligan!

17:27.246 --> 17:29.613
You want something,
skipper?

17:29.682 --> 17:32.283
No, but I want to
do something for you.

17:32.351 --> 17:35.086
Get me my sea chest.

17:41.627 --> 17:43.528
Gilligan?
Yeah, skipper?

17:43.596 --> 17:45.763
It's on my fingers.

17:49.402 --> 17:53.837
Gilligan, I don't know
how much longer
i can hang on

17:53.906 --> 17:57.474
but I want you
to have some of my
valuable possessions.

17:57.543 --> 17:58.709
Aw, come on, skipper.
Don't be silly.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.177
You're gonna
need all your things.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.578
You'll be up and around
by tomorrow.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.414
Gilligan, no, I won't.
The watubi didn't come.

18:04.483 --> 18:06.050
Skipper, you've been
through worse than this.

18:06.118 --> 18:07.685
Gilligan, the watubi
didn't come.

18:07.753 --> 18:10.687
Now, please don't argue.
I'm too weak.

18:10.756 --> 18:13.491
Do you know what this is?
Yeah, your hat.

18:13.560 --> 18:16.661
It means more than that.
It means leadership,

18:16.729 --> 18:19.130
and after I'm gone,
you'll be skipper.

18:19.198 --> 18:20.831
Oh, no.
Put it on.

18:20.900 --> 18:22.533
Oh, no, skipper, you're
still the skipper.

18:22.602 --> 18:23.634
Put it on.

18:23.703 --> 18:25.235
But there's only
one skipper, skipper.

18:25.304 --> 18:26.771
I can never be skipper.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.808
You're right.
Take it off.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.609
We do need you.

18:32.678 --> 18:36.380
Gilligan, you've
got to be brave,
face the facts.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.449
I want you to open
my sea chest.

18:38.518 --> 18:42.653
Some of my most valuable
possessions are in there.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.555
Boy, look
at all that junk.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.624
Ooh!
Sorry, skipper.

18:46.693 --> 18:47.825
Junk?

18:47.894 --> 18:49.259
My life is
in that chest.

18:49.328 --> 18:50.661
That stuff is priceless.

18:50.729 --> 18:52.630
A bottle cap?

18:52.699 --> 18:55.399
Singapore, 1947.

18:55.468 --> 18:58.035
From the first bottle
of beer I ever opened
with my teeth.

18:58.104 --> 18:59.202
What did you
want to do that for?

18:59.271 --> 19:00.638
Well, I didn't want to,

19:00.706 --> 19:02.239
but some guy hit me
in the mouth with a bottle.

19:02.308 --> 19:03.640
You can have that, too.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.910
Well, if you want me
to have it.

19:05.979 --> 19:08.279
Hey, I'll bet
this has got a lot
of memories, huh?

19:08.347 --> 19:10.214
[Loud rattling]

19:10.282 --> 19:12.183
I'm sorry, skipper.
I forgot. Your head.

19:12.252 --> 19:13.884
What difference
does it make?
Take it anyway.

19:13.953 --> 19:17.588
Skipper, what does this
remind you of?

19:17.657 --> 19:20.158
Nothing. It must have
just crawled in there.

19:22.195 --> 19:25.362
There's just one more thing:

19:25.431 --> 19:27.164
I want you
to have this ring.

19:27.233 --> 19:28.365
Oh, no. I couldn't
take that.

19:28.434 --> 19:30.134
Please take it.
No, I can't.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.436
Don't argue.
Help me get it off.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.771
Skipper, I really don't
think I should take
that ring, skipper.

19:34.840 --> 19:35.806
Take it!

19:35.875 --> 19:38.209
Okay, but i
don't want to.

19:38.278 --> 19:40.511
It's been in the family
for over 200 years.

19:40.580 --> 19:42.646
It won't budge.
Well, keep at it.

19:42.714 --> 19:44.281
It's most important
that you have it.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.249
You sure you want me
to have it?

19:45.317 --> 19:46.516
Yes, gilligan!

19:46.585 --> 19:50.421
Could you move over
a little bit?

19:50.489 --> 19:52.890
Never mind. Maybe
we better forget it.

19:52.959 --> 19:54.758
Oh, no, skipper,
I'll get it.

19:54.827 --> 19:55.893
Never mind, gilligan.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.895
No, no, skipper.
I'll get it.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.097
Gilligan, never mind!

20:00.165 --> 20:01.732
Gilligan,
what are you doing?

20:01.801 --> 20:03.667
Oh, I, uh..

20:03.736 --> 20:05.903
Skipper wanted to
give me his ring.

20:05.972 --> 20:07.170
Skipper, is your
head alright?

20:07.239 --> 20:10.007
I don't know,
but my finger's killing me!

20:10.076 --> 20:11.041
You'd better
get some sleep.

20:11.110 --> 20:13.678
Gilligan, you
come on outside.

20:16.282 --> 20:17.748
Now, gilligan, what
was that all about?

20:17.817 --> 20:18.749
He thinks he's done for.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.550
He wanted to give me
all his possessions.

20:20.619 --> 20:22.653
Oh, I was afraid of that.
That means he's sinking lower.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.789
Yeah. He seemed
real disappointed
that watubi didn't come.

20:24.857 --> 20:26.957
Ah, the skipper
and his silly
superstitions.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.993
Well, silly or not,
i wish watubi would come,
whoever he is.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.929
Gilligan?
Huh?

20:31.998 --> 20:33.597
I think I know
who watubi is.

20:33.666 --> 20:34.832
Who? Who?

20:39.204 --> 20:40.538
Oh.

20:43.409 --> 20:44.675
[Snoring]

20:50.917 --> 20:52.383
[Boom]

20:53.720 --> 20:56.320
Fire! Fire!

20:56.389 --> 20:58.622
Fire!

20:58.691 --> 20:59.924
Fire!

21:02.561 --> 21:03.661
Watubi. Watubi.

21:03.730 --> 21:05.362
[Coughing]
[Coughing]

21:05.431 --> 21:07.331
Watubi, I didn't think
you were gonna make it.

21:07.399 --> 21:08.699
Neither did i--

21:08.768 --> 21:10.901
I mean, watubi here
to lift curse of kona!

21:10.970 --> 21:12.102
Oop!

21:12.170 --> 21:13.571
You will?
Yes.

21:13.639 --> 21:15.305
Magic powder, please.

21:15.374 --> 21:18.609
Wee-ahh-lah!
Obee doobee ahh-lah!

21:18.678 --> 21:20.277
Ah-choo!
Gesundheit.

21:20.346 --> 21:21.511
Thank you!

21:21.580 --> 21:24.515
I forgot the chant.
Oh, gee, so did I.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.083
Do you remember it?
You were supposed to.

21:26.152 --> 21:28.886
I'm sorry.
I only had an hour
to learn my lines.

21:28.954 --> 21:31.488
Watubi, what is it?
What's the matter?

21:31.557 --> 21:33.390
We forgot our lines.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.725
Nothing, my son.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.227
Ooh!
¶ whoa ho ¶

21:36.295 --> 21:37.561
¶ ho ho aye ¶

21:37.630 --> 21:38.962

21:39.031 --> 21:39.863

Oh! Oh!

21:39.932 --> 21:41.899
[Whap whap]
Oh! Oh!

21:41.968 --> 21:43.267
¶ Way aye oh oh ¶

21:43.336 --> 21:44.602

Hey!
Hey!

21:44.670 --> 21:47.771
The curse is lifted!
You are well again!

21:47.840 --> 21:51.375
I am? I don't
feel any better.

21:51.444 --> 21:53.110
More magic powder.

21:53.179 --> 21:54.311
¶ Ooh laga lah pooh ¶

21:54.380 --> 21:55.346
[coughing]

21:55.415 --> 21:56.981

22:06.192 --> 22:08.225

Ole! Ole!

22:08.294 --> 22:11.529
Curse is lifted.
Get out of bed.

22:11.597 --> 22:13.897
I--i can't. I can't!

22:13.966 --> 22:16.733
Listen to me.
I am great wa-tun-bi.

22:16.802 --> 22:18.002
Watubi!

22:18.070 --> 22:20.904
Watubi. Get out of bed!
You are cured! Arise!

22:20.973 --> 22:22.439
I command it!

22:22.508 --> 22:23.741
[Rumbling]
Aah!
Aah!

22:23.809 --> 22:25.142
[Rumbling]

22:25.211 --> 22:27.178
Aah!
Aah! Aah!

22:27.246 --> 22:28.212
[Rumbling stops]

22:28.281 --> 22:29.713
How did you
do that?

22:29.782 --> 22:31.148
I don't know. I guess
somebody up there likes me.

22:31.216 --> 22:33.750
Watubi, I was wrong!

22:33.819 --> 22:36.554
Your powers are greater
than kona!

22:36.622 --> 22:38.856
Arise! I command it!

22:38.925 --> 22:42.059
[Rumbling]
Aah!
Aah!

22:44.263 --> 22:46.196
[Rumbling stops]

22:46.265 --> 22:47.531
You will walk now,

22:47.599 --> 22:49.299
or watubi will
make earth tremble again!

22:49.368 --> 22:50.500
Oh, gilligan,
don't press your luck.

22:50.569 --> 22:52.569
Quiet!
I am the great watubi!

22:52.638 --> 22:55.806
Walk! Walk! Walk!

22:57.443 --> 23:00.377
I'm doing it.
It's working!

23:00.446 --> 23:02.713
I'm--
watubi never fails.

23:02.782 --> 23:03.947
I'm cured!

23:04.016 --> 23:05.783
Professor, everyone!

23:05.851 --> 23:06.951
I'm cured!

23:07.019 --> 23:09.920
Everyone, I'm cured!
I'm cured!

23:09.988 --> 23:13.924
Look, I can walk again.
I can walk. Ha ha ha!

23:13.993 --> 23:16.393
I did it! I did it!
Oh, look, how happy.
He's--

23:16.462 --> 23:17.928
skipper, look out
for that--

23:17.997 --> 23:19.497
[whack]

23:40.553 --> 23:42.185
Feeling any better,
skipper?

23:42.254 --> 23:44.922
Oh, this awful heat.
I wish we could do something.

23:44.990 --> 23:46.923
I guess
I'm still weak.

23:46.992 --> 23:48.792
I think I'll go in
and lie down awhile.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.494
Here. Let me
help you, skipper.

23:50.563 --> 23:51.862
Thanks,
gilligan.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.063
[Coughing]

23:53.132 --> 23:54.531
Yes, you'd better
get some rest, skipper.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.699
Thanks, professor.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.234
Gilligan,
you were wonderful.

23:57.302 --> 23:58.535
If he's
so wonderful,

23:58.604 --> 23:59.903
why doesn't he
do something
about this heat?

23:59.972 --> 24:01.305
Maybe I will.

24:01.373 --> 24:02.672
Oh, don't get
carried away, gilligan.

24:02.741 --> 24:04.174
Those earthquakes
were just a coincidence.

24:04.243 --> 24:05.676
Coincidence? What do you mean?
I've got the power.

24:05.744 --> 24:06.844
Alright, watubi.

24:06.912 --> 24:08.745
Let's have a nice,
cool breeze.

24:08.814 --> 24:11.181
Okay, a nice, cool breeze.

24:11.250 --> 24:12.515
I am the great gilligan!

24:12.584 --> 24:13.817
Stop that,
gilligan.

24:13.885 --> 24:15.719
Okay, one nice,
cool breeze.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.722
I am the great gilligan!
I command it!

24:20.959 --> 24:22.393
I don't feel
any breeze.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.660
Neither do I.

24:23.729 --> 24:26.263
The kid is a faker.
Blood will tell.

24:26.332 --> 24:28.566
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Ah! Aah!

24:47.686 --> 24:49.186
I guess I overdid it...

24:49.254 --> 24:50.621
A little.

25:03.102 --> 25:04.568
¶ Now this is the tale
of our castaways ¶

25:04.636 --> 25:06.169
¶ they're here
for a long, long time ¶

25:06.238 --> 25:08.772
¶ they'll have to make
the best of things ¶

25:08.841 --> 25:10.674
¶ it's an uphill climb ¶

25:10.742 --> 25:12.909
¶ the first mate
and his skipper, too ¶

25:12.978 --> 25:14.912
¶ will do their very best ¶

25:14.980 --> 25:17.080
¶ to make the others
comfortable ¶

25:17.149 --> 25:19.115
¶ in their tropic
island nest ¶

25:19.184 --> 25:21.584
¶ no phones, no lights
no motorcars ¶

25:21.653 --> 25:23.653
¶ not a single luxury ¶

25:23.722 --> 25:25.856
¶ like Robinson crusoe ¶

25:25.925 --> 25:27.991
¶ it's primitive as can be ¶

25:28.060 --> 25:30.194
¶ so join us here
each week, my friends ¶

25:30.263 --> 25:32.462
¶ you're sure
to get a smile ¶

25:32.531 --> 25:34.731
¶ for 7 stranded
castaways ¶

25:34.800 --> 25:36.567
¶ here on
gilligan's isle ¶
