02:31.700 --> 02:33.900
"Enchanter, Mobile."

02:36.260 --> 02:39.980
Well, we're a long way from home.
Wake 'em up!

02:49.260 --> 02:50.860
It's the Navy!

02:51.940 --> 02:53.700
Quick, put out the flag!

03:04.260 --> 03:05.380
Enchanter!

03:05.540 --> 03:08.460
This is the United States
Coast Guard.

03:08.620 --> 03:11.900
Heave to
and prepare to be boarded.

03:24.740 --> 03:29.020
Enchanter, you are a US-flag ship,
and we are going to board you.

03:29.180 --> 03:31.540
Heave to now.

03:42.260 --> 03:45.620
Muster your crew on the bow.

04:00.700 --> 04:02.740
You two, go forward.

04:04.020 --> 04:06.260
Randall, come with me.

04:10.980 --> 04:14.660
- Stay where you are.
- Kneel down.

04:17.579 --> 04:20.860
Captain. Captain?

04:21.700 --> 04:23.540
Go ahead, Senior Chief.

04:23.700 --> 04:29.180
It's a bad one. I think you'd better
send over the video camera.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.940
Jack, come on in.

04:50.620 --> 04:53.820
- How high is the pile on your desk?
- About this high.

04:53.980 --> 04:56.260
- Now it's this high.
- What have you got?

04:56.420 --> 05:01.220
You heard about that business in the
South Caribbean? I need the details.

05:01.380 --> 05:04.940
- By when?
- As soon as you can.

05:05.100 --> 05:08.500
- OK.
- Jack? Be discreet.

05:10.100 --> 05:13.860
- What do you mean?
- You'll find out.

05:15.540 --> 05:17.540
Mysterious...

05:19.860 --> 05:21.820
I love a mystery.

05:25.740 --> 05:29.100
- Ryan, John P.
- Let him through.

05:31.020 --> 05:33.700
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

05:33.860 --> 05:37.060
- You know where you're going?
- Yes. Thank you.

05:37.780 --> 05:40.900
- Where do I park?
- Right over there.

05:51.740 --> 05:54.140
Main passageway, going forward.

05:54.300 --> 05:56.900
Master stateroom,
blood on the deck...

05:57.060 --> 06:00.700
19 cartridges were recovered,

06:00.860 --> 06:06.180
as well as the two weapons
that fired them.

06:06.340 --> 06:12.860
Blood samples taken were
consistent with the crew, Hardin

06:13.020 --> 06:16.820
and his wife
and his son and daughter.

06:18.180 --> 06:20.740
I got blood on the sheets and pillow

06:20.900 --> 06:23.300
on both starboard and portside racks.

06:23.460 --> 06:25.380
There's blood there, too.

06:25.540 --> 06:30.020
They were killed in their staterooms
apparently as they slept.

06:30.180 --> 06:33.020
Dragged topside
and thrown overboard.

06:34.340 --> 06:38.820
The two men in custody surrendered
after a brief attempt to escape.

06:38.980 --> 06:42.540
What do we know about them?
The men in custody?

06:44.540 --> 06:48.460
Half a dozen arrests for drug
trafficking in Bogota, Mr President.

06:49.500 --> 06:50.940
Drugs.

06:52.780 --> 06:56.140
Suspected ties to the Cali cartel,
not Medellin...

06:56.300 --> 06:59.660
- You alright, James?
...according to DEA.

06:59.820 --> 07:02.420
- Why?
- Nothing exotic, sir.

07:02.580 --> 07:05.980
Straight piracy and murder.
It's not the first time.

07:07.740 --> 07:11.060
It's the first time
it was a friend of mine.

07:12.540 --> 07:14.620
Yes, sir.

07:20.700 --> 07:23.980
- What was that? You alright?
- Yeah.

07:24.140 --> 07:26.820
I haven't slept in 36 hours.
Did I make any sense?

07:26.980 --> 07:29.620
What did you say?
Just kidding. Good job.

07:33.740 --> 07:38.860
- You should give diplomacy lessons.
- To call it as I see it is myjob.

07:39.020 --> 07:41.860
- And he's yours.
- Wait for me.

07:46.220 --> 07:48.220
Shut the door.

07:51.380 --> 07:56.220
I promised the American people I'd
do something about the drug problem.

07:56.380 --> 07:58.420
You are.

07:58.580 --> 08:02.420
You support the Colombians' efforts
against the cartels...

08:02.580 --> 08:07.980
And accomplish nothing. Do these
drug dealers think we're powerless?

08:08.140 --> 08:13.820
That they can keep doing this kind of
thing, and there's no response ever?

08:14.940 --> 08:18.540
Are you suggesting
a course of action, sir?

08:18.700 --> 08:24.340
The course of action I'd suggest is
a course of action I can't suggest.

08:38.100 --> 08:41.700
I'm... not sure
where that leaves us.

08:45.380 --> 08:49.100
These drug cartels represent
a clear and present danger

08:49.260 --> 08:52.940
to the national security
of the United States.

09:40.820 --> 09:43.420
Do you know what you've done?

09:43.580 --> 09:45.340
I killed a thief,

09:45.940 --> 09:47.740
a thief who was stealing...

09:50.140 --> 09:51.540
...from me!

09:52.660 --> 09:55.540
And his wife, and his son,
and his daughter,

09:55.700 --> 09:58.140
apparently with no thought
of the consequences.

10:01.100 --> 10:06.180
Should I let his children avenge their
father's death when I least expect it?

10:06.900 --> 10:08.580
He was a good friend

10:08.740 --> 10:12.180
and a political ally
of the President of the United States.

10:20.540 --> 10:22.660
That doesn't surprise me.

10:23.500 --> 10:26.740
- It should concern you.
- What can they do?

10:26.900 --> 10:30.020
Come after me? Arrest me?

10:30.180 --> 10:32.460
You're scaring me.

10:33.820 --> 10:38.420
Will you stop long enough for me
to tell you something important?

10:40.860 --> 10:42.700
Thank you.

10:45.380 --> 10:51.540
Listen. You pay me to counsel you,
and I am counselling you.

10:51.700 --> 10:55.300
I'm keeping you alive
with information.

10:55.460 --> 10:57.740
If you disregard my counsel

10:57.900 --> 11:01.140
and keep running your business
the way you have been,

11:01.300 --> 11:05.780
with your balls and not your head,
two things will happen.

11:05.940 --> 11:09.420
I'll quit, and you'll get killed.

11:20.180 --> 11:24.060
You forgot to tell me
about your scouting trip.

11:24.220 --> 11:28.300
- No, I didn't.
- You made another contact. Who?

11:28.460 --> 11:31.540
Castro always asked me
about my sources.

11:31.700 --> 11:37.100
- I always gave him the same answer.
- Castro didn't pay you what I pay.

11:37.260 --> 11:40.260
This one will cost you nothing.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.620
Awoman.

11:43.780 --> 11:46.300
You're using a woman.

11:52.900 --> 11:54.940
It won't float.

11:56.540 --> 11:59.540
- John, what do you want? Toast?
- Waffles!

11:59.700 --> 12:03.100
- No time for waffles.
- Anybody seen my keys?

12:03.260 --> 12:06.020
Either on the front hall table
or in your pocket.

12:06.180 --> 12:08.860
- Where aremykeys?
- Pancakes!

12:09.020 --> 12:11.260
- Toast, please.
- Thank you.

12:11.420 --> 12:12.540
Bye, Dad.

12:12.700 --> 12:15.700
- Bye, pal.
- It won't float!

12:15.860 --> 12:19.940
It's not supposed to float, it's
a submarine. It goes under water.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.700
Jack.

12:23.940 --> 12:25.980
Hello?

12:27.980 --> 12:29.300
When?

12:31.740 --> 12:33.980
I thought I had the flu.

12:34.140 --> 12:37.980
I'd still think so if they weren't
telling me otherwise.

12:39.500 --> 12:42.220
What are they telling you?

12:43.100 --> 12:48.940
Pancreatic cancer of an aggressive
nature, if I heard them right.

12:49.100 --> 12:52.180
Well, what does it mean?

12:53.020 --> 12:55.860
I guess it means I'm in big trouble.

12:56.020 --> 13:00.460
- I mean, can they operate, or?
- Maybe.

13:00.620 --> 13:05.820
That's what they said, "maybe", which
sounds suspiciously like "no" to me.

13:05.980 --> 13:08.580
There's one of them now.

13:12.060 --> 13:13.780
I'm not dead yet.

13:14.740 --> 13:19.620
I am in a hospital, which means
that I'm not in my office,

13:19.780 --> 13:22.060
which means
I don't know what's going on.

13:22.220 --> 13:25.100
- I need you there.
- Where?

13:25.260 --> 13:28.940
- In my office, doing my job.
- Wait a minute...

13:29.100 --> 13:32.300
I hate not knowing
what's going on, you know that.

13:32.460 --> 13:35.340
I wouldn't know
how to do your job, sir.

13:35.500 --> 13:39.620
You've been around.
You've been to the White House.

13:39.780 --> 13:43.460
- Once. I hated it.
- No, you didn't.

13:44.500 --> 13:48.380
Want to know about politics
in Washington? Four words.

13:48.540 --> 13:51.260
"Watch your back, Jack."

13:55.900 --> 14:01.180
Bobby, you should be the first
to know, or the third or fourth.

14:01.340 --> 14:04.700
Ryan is to be
Acting Deputy Director, Intelligence.

14:04.860 --> 14:09.980
It will be a provisional appointment,
of course, until James recovers.

14:10.140 --> 14:13.620
Get him up to speed
on our aid programme to Colombia.

14:13.780 --> 14:18.380
He must talk the Oversight Committee
out of another $75 million.

14:18.540 --> 14:21.980
And not make a complete fool
out of himself.

14:23.820 --> 14:25.860
What about the Hardin murders?

14:26.020 --> 14:29.620
I'm on it. The President's calling
for a full-court press.

14:29.780 --> 14:34.620
So, you guys are going to be
working together hand in hand.

14:35.780 --> 14:37.860
That's great.

14:52.180 --> 14:56.260
Margaret, why don't we
leave all his things?

14:56.420 --> 14:57.940
OK, yeah.

15:09.780 --> 15:12.820
Ryan. I can't believe itl

15:12.980 --> 15:16.500
He's not a team player,
is thatwhat you're saying?

15:16.660 --> 15:18.620
He's a Boy Scout.

15:19.500 --> 15:24.780
A goddamn Boy Scout. Believes in
loyalty, cleanliness and knot-tying.

15:24.940 --> 15:26.940
So leave him out of it.

15:27.100 --> 15:30.980
He's the Deputy Director of
Intelligence. That will be tricky.

15:31.140 --> 15:33.500
What does he need to know?

15:33.660 --> 15:39.820
Nothing. He needs to know nothing.
He's going to know nothing.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.700
I want a copy
of the President's authorisation

15:42.860 --> 15:45.660
of this new action
against the cartels.

15:46.660 --> 15:50.020
- You want what?
- You heard me.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.020
He doesn't know about it.

15:54.900 --> 16:00.820
Let me explain it to you very simply.
This is your deal, not mine.

16:00.980 --> 16:05.860
Unless I have written authorisation,
this thing is over before it begins.

16:06.020 --> 16:10.900
I'm not going to be the only one left
without a chair when the music stops.

16:49.940 --> 16:53.180
"Reciprocity."
That's a clever name for it.

16:53.340 --> 16:57.620
Revenge is a very, very, very
dangerous motivation.

16:59.140 --> 17:05.060
Are you able to handle this operation
or not? I'm looking for a yes or no.

17:05.220 --> 17:08.020
You're looking for a political mess.

17:08.180 --> 17:10.900
- Yes or no?
- Is that what they want?

17:11.060 --> 17:15.420
They want what every first-term
administration wants. A second term.

17:16.700 --> 17:19.940
I don't imagine the boys on the Hill
have approved this.

17:25.380 --> 17:27.380
Have they?

17:29.180 --> 17:31.900
Is that a "no"?

17:36.900 --> 17:38.580
Shit.

17:39.340 --> 17:44.380
I want the money in my account
before I move an inch.

17:44.540 --> 17:46.020
You got it.

17:46.180 --> 17:48.340
- I need a Comsat link.
- You got it.

17:48.500 --> 17:51.700
- An insertion team.
- You can have a brigade.

17:51.860 --> 17:55.020
Just 12 men who understand
discretionary warfare.

17:55.180 --> 17:58.220
Special Ops. Spanish speaking.

18:05.540 --> 18:08.180
- How are you today, sir?
- Very well.

18:08.340 --> 18:11.300
- The purpose of your visit?
- Business.

18:11.460 --> 18:14.260
- What business are you in?
- I sell tractors.

18:14.420 --> 18:17.500
Well, I build them, then I sell them.

18:17.660 --> 18:21.500
- And how long will you be staying?
- A few days.

18:48.140 --> 18:51.820
I know it's a risk,
but what's the alternative?

18:51.980 --> 18:56.100
Zapping a retina with 6,000 rads
of cobalt? Not a pretty picture.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.420
Prettier than a tumour
spreading in the cranial sack.

18:59.580 --> 19:02.660
- What is her name?
- I'm trying to have lunch.

19:03.780 --> 19:07.140
Listen... Hungry?

19:07.300 --> 19:11.020
- Starved.
- We could forget about lunch.

19:11.180 --> 19:16.420
- We did that last time, remember?
- Do I remember? Do you?

19:17.700 --> 19:21.340
- Vaguely.
- Maybe I should refresh your memory.

19:23.620 --> 19:26.500
- Maybe you should.
- Yourtable is ready now.

19:26.660 --> 19:29.580
- We don't need it. I'll get a cab.
- Moira?

19:29.740 --> 19:35.020
- Hi! How are you? How's Jack?
- He's great, just great.

19:35.180 --> 19:38.060
- You still with the FBI?
- The Director's office.

19:38.220 --> 19:40.620
- Who was that?
- My new friend.

19:40.780 --> 19:43.580
Señor Roberto Landa.

19:43.740 --> 19:47.620
- Doesn't he look like Jack?
- Does he? I can't quite see.

19:47.780 --> 19:52.340
- Only Latin.
- A Latin Jack? This I have to see.

19:53.300 --> 19:55.580
I have to go. Bye.

19:57.260 --> 20:01.820
Well, we know it's not piracy.
Pirates steal boats.

20:01.980 --> 20:06.580
They had plane tickets to Bogota
the morning afterthe killings.

20:06.740 --> 20:08.340
- Hey, Dan.
- How's it going?

20:08.500 --> 20:11.820
We're sneaking up on a motive.
Dan Murray, Bureau.

20:11.980 --> 20:14.740
- Ralph Williams, DEA.
- Said anything yet?

20:14.900 --> 20:19.100
- Yeah. "We're innocent."
- Till the DA offers them a deal.

20:19.260 --> 20:22.540
He already has.
Regular or extra crispy?

20:22.700 --> 20:26.140
Either referring to fried chicken
or the electric chair.

20:26.740 --> 20:28.740
Are you picturing a hit?

20:28.900 --> 20:32.860
On a respectable American
businessman and his family?

20:33.820 --> 20:36.700
You're assuming he's respectable.

20:44.820 --> 20:50.260
We have memos, letters,
credit card statements,

20:50.420 --> 20:55.620
phone bills, everything
you could need to break his code.

20:55.780 --> 20:58.700
- What's this?
- Old high school yearbook.

20:58.860 --> 21:02.580
- Sweethearts, football team...
- You think?

21:02.740 --> 21:07.420
- I don't know.
- OK, let's see what we've got.

21:07.580 --> 21:10.540
- No cream?
- There wasn't any.

21:10.700 --> 21:14.340
Let's startwith birthdays.
Bet your ATM code is your birthday.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.060
- Close.
- In reverse?

21:18.860 --> 21:21.620
Alright, his birthday is...

21:22.700 --> 21:27.740
That would be too easy, wouldn't it?
Let's try it in reverse.

21:27.900 --> 21:30.540
No. His wife's?

21:31.540 --> 21:33.260
No. His son's?

21:33.420 --> 21:35.660
- This could take...
- Months.

21:35.820 --> 21:37.700
Son's in reverse. This is for you.

21:40.060 --> 21:42.900
No. Wife's in reverse.

21:43.060 --> 21:45.180
No. Daughter's in reverse.

21:45.340 --> 21:48.260
You've got to change your ATM code.

21:50.540 --> 21:53.220
No. Wife, daughter. Nothing.

21:55.580 --> 21:56.900
Got it.

21:57.060 --> 21:59.020
I got it!

22:08.980 --> 22:12.820
Wife's birth month,
daughter's day, son's year.

22:12.980 --> 22:15.620
But not in reverse. Sorry.

22:22.860 --> 22:25.660
Print me out that one.

22:25.820 --> 22:27.660
Good boy.

22:28.300 --> 22:32.620
Three years ago, Hardin received
an infusion of foreign capital

22:32.780 --> 22:37.500
which he invested in 20 major
shopping centres in the US.

22:37.660 --> 22:42.100
In the middle of the recession,
he posted record profits,

22:42.260 --> 22:46.580
at least to the IRS, who he feared
more than his own partners.

22:46.740 --> 22:50.860
To them, according to the stockholder
statements he was giving them,

22:51.020 --> 22:54.060
the shopping centres
weren't doing nearly as well.

22:54.220 --> 22:58.380
But he wasjust skimming
most of the profits, $650 million,

22:58.540 --> 23:01.900
and putting it in accounts
in Luxembourg, Panama

23:02.060 --> 23:04.060
and the Cayman Islands.

23:05.420 --> 23:07.420
They killed him for it.

23:07.580 --> 23:09.420
Who?

23:09.580 --> 23:12.660
- His partners.
- Who were his partners?

23:12.820 --> 23:18.940
It seems clear that he was laundering
money for the Colombian drug cartels.

23:19.100 --> 23:24.700
Jesus! I knew the man for 40 years.
We went to school together.

23:25.580 --> 23:27.980
We almostwent
into business together.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.660
That would have been good.

23:32.180 --> 23:35.060
The press is going to
have a field day with this.

23:35.220 --> 23:39.660
- No one outside this room knows.
- They will. They always do.

23:39.820 --> 23:43.540
It will come up, you're right
about that. When it does,

23:43.700 --> 23:48.980
we'll downplay your relationship
with Hardin somehow.

23:51.500 --> 23:53.140
- What?
- What?

23:53.300 --> 23:56.860
- We'll defuse it.
- Do you disagree?

23:57.020 --> 23:58.460
No.

23:58.620 --> 24:03.220
Well, actually, yes. I would go
in the other direction.

24:03.380 --> 24:08.540
If a reporter asked if you and Hardin
were friends, I'd say "good friends".

24:08.700 --> 24:13.220
If they asked if you were good
friends, I'd say"lifelong friends".

24:13.380 --> 24:18.860
Give them no place to go,
nothing to report. No story.

24:21.020 --> 24:25.580
I mean, it's no sense in
defusing a bomb after it's already...

24:26.820 --> 24:29.260
...it's already gone off.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.300
- Damn!
- Shit!

24:55.060 --> 24:56.580
Do you see him?

24:57.780 --> 25:01.420
Alright. Move your team
two metres to the left.

25:04.740 --> 25:07.340
That's it. Stop.

25:07.500 --> 25:11.900
Touch that light-coloured grass.
Sniper at your feet.

25:12.740 --> 25:14.500
Nothing here, Sergeant Major.

25:14.660 --> 25:17.820
- Damn!
- He is good.

25:33.900 --> 25:36.900
Thatwas close.
How's he moving so fast?

25:42.420 --> 25:46.380
I see him. Come in.
Straight in. Now. Run!

25:47.580 --> 25:49.580
Keep coming.

25:51.180 --> 25:55.620
Stop. To your left. To your left.

25:56.260 --> 26:00.300
And stop. Sniper at your feet.

26:01.900 --> 26:04.220
What is it?

26:06.860 --> 26:08.540
He had lunch here.

26:09.460 --> 26:11.260
McDonald's quarter-pounder.

26:11.420 --> 26:13.260
With cheese.

26:14.780 --> 26:16.220
Damn.

26:22.020 --> 26:24.540
- Damn!
- That's four.

26:25.620 --> 26:29.460
Alright, you won this one.
Come on out!

26:31.180 --> 26:34.220
Soldier, how did you get
that close to me?

26:34.380 --> 26:39.540
Sniper approached instructor by being
a sneaky bastard, Sergeant Major!

26:39.700 --> 26:43.620
Do you know the fine for littering
in California, Chavez?

26:43.780 --> 26:46.140
Yes, sir!

26:48.460 --> 26:52.020
I saw you on the sniper course.
You looked good.

26:52.180 --> 26:55.700
- Just about finished here, Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

26:55.860 --> 26:59.660
Looking forward to taking
some leave with your wife and kids?

27:00.460 --> 27:04.260
- Don't have any wife or kids, sir.
- What do you have?

27:05.180 --> 27:11.420
You don't call anybody often, you
don't write or receive many letters.

27:13.900 --> 27:16.540
Who are you, sir, if I may ask?

27:16.700 --> 27:21.100
Mr Clark and I are putting together
a mission. My team is a part of it.

27:21.260 --> 27:25.820
You'd be gone up to six months,
after which, if you're not dead,

27:25.980 --> 27:29.340
you'd have your choice
of assignments in Special Ops.

27:45.340 --> 27:50.580
...defusing an issue that was
snowballing into another scandal.

27:50.740 --> 27:54.820
"The New York Times"reports that
you and Hardin were good friends.

27:54.980 --> 27:58.940
No, not good friends.
We were lifelong friends.

27:59.100 --> 28:02.820
I said that. I said that.

28:04.700 --> 28:06.860
I told him to say that.

28:07.020 --> 28:10.580
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

28:10.740 --> 28:14.340
- But you were thinking something.
- No.

28:14.500 --> 28:19.260
I was just distracted by the trouble
you were having with your ensemble.

28:20.140 --> 28:24.780
Well, it's not every day
you have to look trustworthy.

28:24.940 --> 28:28.580
- Who told who to say what?
- It's not important.

28:29.580 --> 28:32.180
- The President?
- Yeah.

28:32.340 --> 28:36.620
Mom says she makes more money
than the President.

28:36.780 --> 28:39.980
She's probably right. Bye.

28:47.980 --> 28:52.020
Thank you, Dr Ryan, for the
information you've shared with us.

28:52.780 --> 28:56.260
- Thank you, Senator.
- We have to help the Colombians

28:56.420 --> 29:00.700
in their struggle to curtail
the drug cartels' activities.

29:00.860 --> 29:06.140
However, I'm confused.
How do you see additional funds

29:06.300 --> 29:09.700
advancing this programme
from the failure that it is?

29:09.860 --> 29:14.020
- You see what I'm getting at?
- No, I'm afraid I don't.

29:14.180 --> 29:17.540
You said this effort would be
totally benign on our part.

29:17.700 --> 29:22.060
Our assistance is limited
to supply and advice only.

29:22.220 --> 29:23.900
I've read that.

29:24.060 --> 29:28.060
I've also read a similar finding
written 35 years ago

29:28.220 --> 29:32.540
regarding a little-thought-of
sliver ofjungle in Southeast Asia.

29:32.700 --> 29:38.580
You're comparing our request
for anti-drug funds to Vietnam?

29:38.740 --> 29:42.740
I'm comparing it to every time
a committee such as this is asked

29:42.900 --> 29:47.260
to render judgement
based on less than all the facts.

29:50.060 --> 29:52.940
I'm afraid I don't know
what to say to that.

29:53.100 --> 29:56.180
You can assure us
that we have all the facts.

29:56.340 --> 29:57.820
I thought I had.

29:57.980 --> 30:03.340
You can further assure us then
that this increase in funds

30:03.500 --> 30:06.860
will not be used for
any covert military action.

30:07.020 --> 30:10.100
I don't know how
you're getting to this.

30:10.340 --> 30:13.540
Long experience, sir.

30:13.700 --> 30:15.740
No troops then?

30:15.900 --> 30:21.420
I enunciate that clearly because I
don't want there to be any mistake.

30:21.580 --> 30:23.220
No troops.

30:24.140 --> 30:26.980
You could say
I have your word on that?

30:27.140 --> 30:30.220
You could indeed, because you do.

30:44.420 --> 30:50.820
Listen up! Dog tags.
Take 'em off, pass 'em forward.

30:50.980 --> 30:56.500
Check your pockets for anything
that can be used for identification.

31:04.100 --> 31:05.420
We're feet dry.

31:18.660 --> 31:21.740
LZ in sight. Get ready.

31:21.900 --> 31:24.860
Good luck, boys. Go get 'em.

31:28.580 --> 31:30.700
OK, let's take her down now.

31:46.380 --> 31:48.620
Go, go, go!

33:13.180 --> 33:14.780
Hey, Bob.

33:16.780 --> 33:19.220
- How you doing?
- Good, sir.

33:20.180 --> 33:22.220
Good to see you.

33:27.900 --> 33:31.260
- Morning, Jack.
- Ryan! Come on in.

33:31.420 --> 33:34.180
- Do you know everyone?
- Yes, yes.

33:34.340 --> 33:38.340
- Coffee? Bagel?
- Coffee. Black.

33:38.500 --> 33:41.460
- How's the family?
- Good, sir.

33:41.620 --> 33:45.140
- When do I meet the other Dr Ryan?
- She's dying to meet you, sir.

33:45.300 --> 33:47.340
Good, good. Sit down.

33:49.660 --> 33:51.340
Thank you.

33:51.500 --> 33:53.620
So.

33:53.780 --> 33:57.740
- The cash is still there?
- Sir?

33:57.900 --> 34:01.980
- In Hardin's offshore accounts.
- $650 million.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.140
- And change.
- And change.

34:04.300 --> 34:07.700
- And we have the account numbers.
- Yes, sir.

34:07.860 --> 34:11.659
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's get it.

34:11.820 --> 34:14.580
- Let's get it?
- Let's turn this thing around.

34:14.739 --> 34:16.820
$650 million and change.

34:16.980 --> 34:21.699
It's worth ten times that
in political capital.

34:22.739 --> 34:25.300
What?

34:25.460 --> 34:32.820
Well, this connection between
Hardin and the cartels is a theory.

34:32.980 --> 34:35.300
- Theory?
- Atheory of mine.

34:35.460 --> 34:38.980
- It's a theory?
- Well, I know the money is there.

34:39.139 --> 34:43.739
But who exactly Hardin
was working for, I don't know.

34:43.900 --> 34:49.380
I think we would have to establish
that before we could seize the money.

34:52.020 --> 34:55.179
So go down there. Establish it.

34:55.340 --> 34:57.900
- Go where?
- Colombia.

34:59.580 --> 35:02.020
Who, me?

35:05.180 --> 35:09.860
I leave you alone for two weeks,
and you walk into a big bear trap.

35:10.020 --> 35:11.980
What was I thinking?

35:12.140 --> 35:18.260
You were thinking about impressing
the President. You shouldn't do that.

35:18.420 --> 35:21.620
- November.
- January.

35:21.780 --> 35:23.500
Of last year.

35:26.340 --> 35:30.860
There's a guy down there,
at least he used to be... Clark.

35:31.780 --> 35:34.100
We go way back. Good man.

35:34.260 --> 35:37.100
If you hit a brick wall, look him up.

35:38.140 --> 35:40.380
Admiral Greer?

35:40.540 --> 35:43.820
- Chemotherapy.
- Oh, shit.

35:44.580 --> 35:46.700
Here we go again.

35:47.940 --> 35:50.180
How's Ritter behaving?

35:50.340 --> 35:53.900
Ritter's Ritter.
He's leaving me alone.

35:54.060 --> 35:58.060
Are you sure?
Watch him like a hawk.

35:58.220 --> 36:00.380
- How are you feeling today?
- OK.

36:00.540 --> 36:05.980
We'll get you in a room, give you
warm blankets, get you lying down.

36:06.140 --> 36:09.620
Then we'll get you back
to your room and comfortable.

37:01.860 --> 37:05.060
Variable, this is Knife,
stand by to copy, over.

37:07.900 --> 37:10.940
Variable, this is Knife,
stand by to copy, over.

37:11.100 --> 37:15.020
Knife, this is Variable,
your signal is five by five, over.

37:18.180 --> 37:20.100
Clear.

37:42.700 --> 37:44.980
The chicken is in the pot. Over.

37:46.740 --> 37:49.580
- Cook it.
- Roger that.

38:05.340 --> 38:08.500
Honey? I'm late.

38:09.380 --> 38:12.580
- Bye.
- Have a good trip.

38:13.620 --> 38:16.380
I'm not gonna say it.

38:16.540 --> 38:18.300
Don't.

38:18.460 --> 38:20.460
Be careful.

38:47.100 --> 38:53.420
Local time is, well, actually, it's
the same as Washington, 11:16am.

38:53.580 --> 38:56.940
Temperature
is 69 degrees Fahrenheit...

39:03.140 --> 39:05.340
Dr Ryan!

39:14.700 --> 39:17.860
DEASpecial Agent Jean Fowler.
How you doing?

39:18.020 --> 39:20.140
- First time in Bogota?
- Yeah.

39:20.300 --> 39:24.540
Let's not stand here
and let someone take a shot at you.

39:24.700 --> 39:26.580
Come on, sir, let's go.

39:40.380 --> 39:43.900
- And these two are?
- They're brothers.

39:46.500 --> 39:50.620
Don't do that. Give Dr Ryan
a bit more air back here, please.

39:50.780 --> 39:52.780
Bulletproof.

39:59.740 --> 40:03.500
We don't have a picture.
Escobedo's intelligence officer.

40:03.660 --> 40:06.660
We don't have a name either,
but we know he exists.

40:07.620 --> 40:10.380
The invisible man?

40:11.100 --> 40:13.660
Gently, gently, with your hands.

40:13.820 --> 40:16.940
Luis, put your hands together.

40:17.620 --> 40:20.420
No, your hands together!

40:23.300 --> 40:25.700
Luis, watch the canter.

40:26.900 --> 40:29.780
Yes, very good.

40:33.740 --> 40:34.940
Yes?

40:37.660 --> 40:39.220
We lost another plane.

40:42.420 --> 40:43.940
OK.

40:46.860 --> 40:50.700
- Who is doing this?
- If I had to guess...

40:50.860 --> 40:54.300
No, I did not ask you to guess.
I can guess.

40:55.140 --> 40:57.740
Someone has been talking
to the drug police.

40:57.900 --> 41:02.860
Impossible. If anyone spoke to
the police, I'd be the first to know.

41:03.020 --> 41:05.020
Ernesto?

41:06.380 --> 41:11.300
Is one of the others trying to ruin
me after what I did to the American?

41:11.460 --> 41:16.700
I guess that wasn't quite the
deterrent you thought itwould be.

41:16.860 --> 41:19.340
Find out who it is.

41:26.540 --> 41:30.180
What do you make of this, Colonel?

41:30.340 --> 41:32.340
An opportunity.

41:34.380 --> 41:36.700
An opportunity, Sipo.

41:50.340 --> 41:53.940
- Good afternoon.
- Messages, please?

41:55.220 --> 41:59.620
- Dr Ryan?
- Clark? Sorry I'm late.

41:59.780 --> 42:02.220
I've got ten minutes.

42:04.340 --> 42:08.260
I'm positive Hardin was tied
into the cartels. It's drug money.

42:08.420 --> 42:12.180
- But you can't prove it.
- So far.

42:13.540 --> 42:16.780
- Mind if I ask you a question?
- No.

42:16.940 --> 42:22.700
Why are you telling me all this? I've
been out of the game for a long time.

42:24.820 --> 42:30.020
I was told that you were wired, and
that you knew the town and people.

42:30.180 --> 42:33.540
- That you were a player.
- Who told you that?

42:35.260 --> 42:37.100
Jim Greer.

42:38.820 --> 42:40.420
How's he doing?

42:43.420 --> 42:46.100
He's not good.

42:47.180 --> 42:49.020
He has cancer.

42:49.180 --> 42:51.420
Terminal.

42:53.180 --> 42:57.180
- He's a good man.
- The best.

43:03.180 --> 43:05.540
You a coffee drinker, Dr Ryan?

43:08.580 --> 43:12.300
- Yeah, I like coffee.
- Try the Lindo brand.

43:12.460 --> 43:15.820
- Lindo?
- I think you'll like it.

43:21.540 --> 43:24.980
Mr President,
I've got some good news.

43:25.140 --> 43:29.820
Hardin's partner here was someone
you may know of. Ernesto Escobedo.

43:29.980 --> 43:35.140
- Escobedo? It figures.
- Is this another of your theories?

43:35.300 --> 43:41.100
No, sir. We can call this one fact.
Escobedo, like every drug lord here,

43:41.260 --> 43:46.700
also had legitimate businesses.
Hardin was doing business with these.

43:46.860 --> 43:51.940
Importing, among other things,
coffee, which means nothing,

43:52.100 --> 43:58.340
but he was paying too much
for this coffee. $6,200 a pound.

43:58.500 --> 44:01.900
- That's expensive coffee.
- I'd have to agree.

44:02.060 --> 44:04.780
This is good news.
I think this does it.

44:04.940 --> 44:08.740
Sir, I also have some other news
which is not so good.

44:09.660 --> 44:11.180
Oh, God.

44:12.460 --> 44:17.060
The DEAfeels that the government
here would want the seized funds.

44:17.220 --> 44:21.900
- Or at least a large portion.
- This is our money.

44:22.060 --> 44:25.700
- We found it.
- We can try telling them that.

44:25.860 --> 44:29.140
Try? Tell them.
Or don't tell them, I don't care.

44:29.300 --> 44:33.820
- Sir, with all due respect...
- This is our money, tell them that.

44:33.980 --> 44:38.860
I wouldn't know what to say or
where to start. I'm not a negotiator.

44:39.020 --> 44:41.180
You know someone
in their government?

44:41.340 --> 44:43.900
I went to school
with their Attorney General.

44:44.060 --> 44:49.620
Jacobs will come down.
He'll negotiate. This is our money.

44:49.780 --> 44:50.780
Thank...

44:52.380 --> 44:54.380
Thank you.

44:57.140 --> 44:59.140
I hate this job.

46:13.820 --> 46:16.180
Eyes up!

46:18.220 --> 46:20.340
Demo team, up!

46:27.140 --> 46:29.300
Fire in the hole!

46:33.620 --> 46:36.900
Let's go, let's go!
Move out! Go, go, go!

46:39.500 --> 46:40.540
Down! Down!

46:57.500 --> 46:59.900
Whoever did this is dead.

47:01.220 --> 47:05.620
Whoever did this to me is dead!

47:05.780 --> 47:10.500
Do you hear me?
Are you listening to me?

47:24.700 --> 47:28.100
Mr Jacobs, could you sign these
before you leave?

47:29.500 --> 47:34.540
Moira, why don't you
call in sick tomorrow?

47:34.700 --> 47:37.940
And the next day.
I won't tell anybody.

47:38.100 --> 47:41.420
Even when you're not here
there's plenty to do.

47:41.580 --> 47:45.740
- Your itinerary.
- You're arguing with me about this?

47:45.900 --> 47:49.420
You work too hard. Adiós.

48:26.700 --> 48:29.660
- LandayLanda.
- Roberto Landa, please.

48:29.820 --> 48:34.100
- This is Moira Wolfson.
- One moment, please.

48:34.260 --> 48:37.940
I think he's on the factory floor.
Hold on.

48:42.980 --> 48:46.740
- Yes?
- A Moira Wolfson is calling.

48:47.740 --> 48:52.420
I told her you were
on the factory floor. Go ahead.

48:52.580 --> 48:55.660
- Moira!
- Hi.

48:55.820 --> 48:57.900
You free the next couple of days?

48:58.060 --> 49:00.900
- Next couple of days?
- I am.

49:01.580 --> 49:04.140
My boss is leaving the country.

49:05.900 --> 49:10.740
- Can I call you later?
- Alright, call me at home. Bye.

49:19.060 --> 49:25.020
Good afternoon.
Good news in the fight against drugs.

49:25.180 --> 49:28.820
An investigation
by the Department of Justice

49:28.980 --> 49:33.460
has identified several
bank accounts from Luxembourg

49:33.620 --> 49:37.500
to the Cayman Islands,
used for laundering drug money

49:37.660 --> 49:42.860
on an unprecedented scale.
With five foreign governments

49:43.020 --> 49:46.260
we have taken steps
to seize those funds

49:46.420 --> 49:51.180
- which amount to over $650 million.
- Shit.

49:51.340 --> 49:56.300
Also to seize 20 real estate
joint-venture investments in the US

49:56.460 --> 50:02.100
which were the primary agencies
in the laundering operations.

50:02.260 --> 50:05.860
You did say $650 million?

50:06.020 --> 50:09.660
That's right.
$650 million. And change.

50:09.820 --> 50:12.100
They're stealing my money!

50:12.260 --> 50:17.060
- What's our take?
- It's hard to say at the moment.

50:17.220 --> 50:21.980
No, it isn't. You're stealing my
money. I made it, you're stealing it!

50:22.740 --> 50:28.140
Mr President, can we speak with
FBI Director Jacobs about this?

50:28.300 --> 50:32.020
- Jacobs is not available.
- Someone will die for this.

50:32.180 --> 50:37.020
He's personally involved in the
investigation and is pretty busy.

50:47.260 --> 50:52.180
This avenue has to be avoided.
They'll be coming from the airport.

50:52.340 --> 50:56.220
Up Avenida Aeropuerto El Dorado
all the way to Gran America.

50:56.380 --> 51:01.100
Santa Fe's our spot. As much as
I'd love to be here for this,

51:01.260 --> 51:07.100
I have to take care of business in
Washington, tying up loose ends.

51:15.460 --> 51:18.900
Hello?
Don't hang up, don't hang up.

51:20.460 --> 51:24.820
- Hello?
- The machine is still on, Moira.

51:56.060 --> 51:59.780
- Emil, good to see you.
- Andy, good to see you.

51:59.940 --> 52:04.460
- Agent Murray, Ambassador Ferris.
- Hi, good to see you.

52:04.620 --> 52:09.500
- This will bring you up to date.
- Alright, let's go.

52:21.700 --> 52:26.220
- How's the food?
- It's like Mexican food.

52:26.380 --> 52:29.700
- You hate Mexican food.
- I hate Mexican food.

53:04.100 --> 53:06.380
- Hi.
- Hello.

53:06.540 --> 53:11.260
All my secretary knows about America
is what she reads inPeoplemagazine.

53:11.420 --> 53:14.860
- How's the place?
- Come inside and find out.

53:22.500 --> 53:25.380
It's awful.

53:27.180 --> 53:29.420
Isn't it?

53:51.540 --> 53:53.900
So I take it you shouldn't
drink the water?

53:55.540 --> 54:00.220
They put water in your room,
but I'd stick to the bottled stuff.

54:47.660 --> 54:50.540
So what do you brush your teeth with?

54:50.700 --> 54:55.100
You use the bottled water, or you'll
be in the can all yourtime here.

55:02.420 --> 55:04.820
The hold-up
was a government connection?

55:04.980 --> 55:06.900
Yeah, that's the connection.

55:57.020 --> 55:58.980
Back up! Back up!

56:04.980 --> 56:07.220
- Step on it!
- Stay down. Stay down.

56:21.100 --> 56:23.180
Damn it! Back up!

56:26.700 --> 56:29.580
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Take it easy, Andy.

56:30.060 --> 56:33.500
Got to keep moving. Go, Jack!

56:49.020 --> 56:51.380
Incoming!

57:28.660 --> 57:29.780
Dan!

58:00.140 --> 58:02.060
Dan! Dan!

58:12.340 --> 58:15.060
We can't stay here!

58:16.860 --> 58:19.180
The car! Is it running?

58:19.340 --> 58:21.260
It's running!

58:21.420 --> 58:26.220
The smoke will give us cover.
It's our only chance. I got him.

58:26.380 --> 58:29.180
Make for the driver's side.
Ready? Go!

58:39.460 --> 58:42.620
- Get in!
- Go! Go!

59:43.340 --> 59:45.740
Housekeeping.

59:55.140 --> 59:57.500
Oh, excuse me, ma'am.

01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:09.660
- Do you have a call for Dr Ryan?
- Just a moment.

01:00:09.820 --> 01:00:11.500
...in Bogota today.

01:00:11.660 --> 01:00:16.340
Ten members of the escort party
were also killed and eight wounded.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:20.060
Five of the dead
were security personnel...

01:00:20.220 --> 01:00:24.860
- Cathy?
- Don't tell me you're in this.

01:00:25.020 --> 01:00:28.780
Right in the middle of it.
Honey, Dan was killed.

01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:31.060
Dan Murray.

01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:37.540
He was ten feet away.
There was nothing I could do.

01:00:39.460 --> 01:00:42.540
- I'm coming home.
- Thank God.

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:45.180
I love you.

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:52.900
- Wasn't his going there a secret?
- It was.

01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:57.420
- Then I don't get it. What happened?
- Nobody knows.

01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:01.820
- How stupid are these people?
- They believe they can do anything.

01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:05.020
You know what? They're wrong.

01:01:05.180 --> 01:01:07.700
- Yes, sir.
- They're wrong.

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:14.260
They've directly challenged the
sovereign power of the United States.

01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:17.460
No more sending messages.

01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:21.580
He wants them to get the message
whether the phone rings or not.

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:26.380
- Those are his words?
- Do they sound like his words?

01:01:26.540 --> 01:01:30.860
He can't be clear when clarity
is what he wants to avoid.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:34.420
What he means is the gloves come off.

01:01:50.780 --> 01:01:54.220
I'm telling you,
I had nothing to do with it.

01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:58.940
I didn't. I wish I had done it,
they deserved it. But it wasn't me.

01:01:59.100 --> 01:02:01.140
Who did then?

01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:05.940
You know, you have no answers.

01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:10.900
Is this the way it was with Castro?
No answers?

01:02:11.060 --> 01:02:14.140
- You don't want to hear an answer.
- Yes, I do.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:20.060
Itwas done to look like you did it.
By one of the others.

01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:24.260
As you suspected. It's always
a friend who hates you most.

01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:26.420
Give me the phone.

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:35.300
- Rojas.
- Did you do this thing?

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:41.180
Did I do this thing? Are you calling
to ask me if I did this thing?

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:45.100
You don't consult with us.
You put us in danger.

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:49.980
And now you want me
to believe it wasn't you?

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:51.860
It wasn't, Enrique.

01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:55.100
The Americans will retaliate
against all of us.

01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:58.380
I swear I had
nothing to do with it.

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:02.460
Why do you expect me
to listen to you when you lie?

01:03:02.620 --> 01:03:05.060
- Goodbye, Ernesto.
- No, no, no!

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:08.220
Don't hang up.
We must have a meeting.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:11.140
- When?
- As soon as possible.

01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:19.340
Tomorrow night. I am not
telling you, I am asking you!

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:21.260
May we meet tomorrow night?

01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:24.340
- Tomorrow afternoon.
- Thank you.

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.140
- He's scared.
- He should be.

01:03:55.300 --> 01:03:58.140
I don't know what you said to him,
but it was right.

01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:28.940
Strange, don't you think?

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:33.660
Jacobs and his secretary
getting killed on the same day.

01:05:34.660 --> 01:05:38.900
He wasn't his secretary. He was
a member of the security detail.

01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.060
Who?

01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:45.980
- I don't remember his name.
- I'm talking about Moira.

01:05:46.140 --> 01:05:47.380
What?

01:05:47.540 --> 01:05:49.780
Moira, remember?
Jacobs's secretary.

01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:53.900
I know Moira, honey.
What are you talking about?

01:05:59.140 --> 01:06:02.420
- She said he was a Latin Jack Ryan.
- He was.

01:06:02.580 --> 01:06:06.580
- That's what she called him.
- The point is, he's Latin.

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:08.980
Which connects her death and Jacobs's

01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:11.820
beyond the fact
that they worked together.

01:06:11.980 --> 01:06:15.460
You saw somebody you think
is responsible for both killings?

01:06:15.620 --> 01:06:17.220
- Yes.
- Yes.

01:06:18.980 --> 01:06:20.620
She did.

01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:23.620
She did.

01:06:30.660 --> 01:06:33.820
I saw him from a distance.
From behind.

01:06:33.980 --> 01:06:38.700
- Medium height, medium build, etc?
- Mind if I look at these?

01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:41.500
Is that what the people
from the cabin said?

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:42.580
Yeah.

01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:48.620
Did you check out
these calls to Venezuela?

01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:51.020
Disconnected.

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.700
- So you have no leads?
- I have a lot.

01:06:56.860 --> 01:07:01.740
Afictitious name on a register. A
stolen phoned-in credit card number.

01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:06.900
Two eyewitnesses, one of whom
saw a guy but really didn't see him.

01:07:07.060 --> 01:07:09.860
Excuse me,
could you play that again?

01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:11.300
Yes, sir.

01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:14.180
The machine is still on, Moira.

01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:17.260
You have a recording
of the killer's voice.

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:20.380
Maybe.

01:07:23.140 --> 01:07:28.260
Jack. I think we've got something.
This is from the answering machine.

01:07:28.420 --> 01:07:32.780
And this was recorded yesterday.
I'll play it for you.

01:07:36.900 --> 01:07:39.660
The machine is still on, Moira.

01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:42.100
And...

01:07:42.260 --> 01:07:46.700
He's scared. I don't know what
you said to him, but it was right.

01:07:46.860 --> 01:07:49.820
Run a match on that.

01:07:52.420 --> 01:07:54.860
He's Cuban.

01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:58.140
35 to 45.

01:07:58.300 --> 01:08:02.700
Educated in the United States.
Eastern United States.

01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:06.260
- It's the same voice.
- You're sure?

01:08:06.420 --> 01:08:08.620
- Yeah.
- How sure?

01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:15.340
90 percent.

01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.580
- I need a name.
- Could be hundreds of thousands...

01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:23.300
I know. I need a name,
and I need it quick.

01:08:40.779 --> 01:08:43.660
300 is topside.

01:09:25.779 --> 01:09:28.060
Target is set.

01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:32.779
- Hector!
- Enrique!

01:09:34.140 --> 01:09:36.340
Good to see you!

01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.060
- It was not easy for us.
- How are you?

01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:43.380
Rojas, Diaz...

01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:48.020
What the hell is this?

01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:50.740
What the hell is this?

01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:55.060
My new toy. Like it?

01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:57.980
You see this?

01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:02.900
That's your new target,
unless it's not big enough.

01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:11.020
Variable, this is Easy Rhino.
Do you copy? Over.

01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:13.980
Loud and clear, Easy Rhino.

01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:17.980
- Do we have a gig?
- That's a Rog.

01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:26.340
Target is lit.

01:10:26.500 --> 01:10:28.220
Start the music.

01:10:29.300 --> 01:10:31.060
Into attack.

01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:37.020
Pickle's hot. Target is acquired
and lit. Coming down.

01:10:41.420 --> 01:10:48.060
Fernandez, Vega...
Looks like a full house.

01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:59.540
Damn it!
Why doesn't he fix this road?

01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:03.700
Shit! Thought we had everybody.

01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:06.700
Keep the target painted.

01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:35.740
Sir?

01:11:40.820 --> 01:11:41.820
Boom.

01:11:50.820 --> 01:11:52.300
Mother of God!

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:58.860
Circular error probability zero.

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:03.500
Impact with high-order detonation.
Have a nice day.

01:12:08.820 --> 01:12:12.020
The man's completely out of control.
He has no...

01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:24.140
His name is Cortez, Felix Cortez.

01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:26.580
A colonel
in Cuba's intelligence service

01:12:26.740 --> 01:12:28.740
until a few years ago. Disappeared.

01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:33.620
Turned up working for the Macheteros,
a terrorist group in Puerto Rico.

01:12:33.780 --> 01:12:35.140
Disappeared again.

01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:39.540
Yesterday, we taped him
talking to a Cali cartel subject.

01:12:39.700 --> 01:12:44.060
I'll fax what I have on him.
If he shows, pick him up, OK?

01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:47.940
- You know I can't do that.
- I mean the police, the Colombians.

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:52.020
The Colombian police
do not pick up members of the cartel.

01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:55.780
Unless they've got a death wish.
You've been down here.

01:12:56.900 --> 01:12:58.540
Wait a minute.

01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:03.500
Oh, Jesus!
Jack, something's happened here.

01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:19.260
At least 30 people were killed,
including women and children.

01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:23.700
The bomb exploded in a car
belongingto a Rojas associate.

01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:27.500
- Jack?
- Yeah, are you watching this?

01:13:27.660 --> 01:13:30.740
- Did this just happen?
- Just now.

01:13:33.740 --> 01:13:37.820
Send me all the stuff, and we'll
put a tail on him if we spot him.

01:13:37.980 --> 01:13:41.140
If he's still alive. I've got to go.

01:13:41.300 --> 01:13:45.300
...a series of explosions.
- Cops claim the violence...

01:13:45.460 --> 01:13:48.780
- A surgical strike, you said.
- It was perfect.

01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:52.860
- They brought out a kid. On NBC.
- Take the gloves off, you said.

01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:56.500
- I know what I said.
- A bit late to change your mind.

01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:58.940
I'm not changing my mind.

01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:03.300
I hadn't counted on
this kind of collateral damage.

01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:07.540
- Neither had he.
- It will be interpreted as I said.

01:14:07.700 --> 01:14:11.620
Rivalry that ended
in the blast of a car bomb.

01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:12.780
Goodnight.

01:14:27.340 --> 01:14:30.580
- Morning, Rose. Finish the report?
- Hot off the press.

01:14:30.740 --> 01:14:32.100
Thanks.

01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:38.100
Could any of the bombing victims'
names be aliases?

01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:42.780
No. All IDs have been confirmed.
Who were you hoping for?

01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:46.660
If he's not here, he's not here.
Cortez. He's not here.

01:14:48.820 --> 01:14:52.860
- Why was Operations copied on this?
- Ritter requested it.

01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:56.860
Ritter? You look very nice today.

01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:59.780
Thank you.

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:14.420
Car bomb.

01:15:23.660 --> 01:15:26.180
What happens
when a car bomb goes off?

01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:30.140
- It explodes.
- It blows up and out?

01:15:30.300 --> 01:15:32.700
And a missile?

01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:38.340
- This deeper crater?
- That's characteristic.

01:15:38.500 --> 01:15:40.660
Bring up the satellite photo.

01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:49.820
HMX and TNT.

01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:53.500
When you mix it 70-30,
you get a compound called Octol.

01:15:53.660 --> 01:15:56.820
Put enough explosives in a car,
you get a crater that big.

01:15:56.980 --> 01:16:01.100
- It's very stable. Very expensive.
- Would it still be in the crater?

01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:04.700
- Very violent.
- There would be pieces all around.

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:11.820
- Where is Octol made?
- Lots of places. Europe. The US.

01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:16.620
But nobody uses it. Nobody can
afford it except the military.

01:16:16.780 --> 01:16:21.820
An aerial bomb would do that.
But that's not an aerial bomb.

01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:23.300
- It's not?
- No.

01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:26.940
There is also
a cellulose residue on everything.

01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:30.140
There should be shrapnel.
Here and here.

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:33.900
- But there isn't.
- No bomb fragments.

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:20.100
"Cellulose encased
laser-guided bomb."

01:17:22.100 --> 01:17:23.700
Paper.

01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.460
The Americans are here.

01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:03.220
"We have something in common.
We cannot implement policy

01:18:03.380 --> 01:18:07.180
without tacit authorisation
from our employer."

01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:12.100
"We also both know that there are
American troops in Colombia

01:18:12.260 --> 01:18:15.100
fighting an illegal war."

01:18:16.100 --> 01:18:20.820
"I will be at Hotel Paloma de Oro
in Panama City on Wednesday."

01:18:20.980 --> 01:18:22.820
"I suggest we meet."

01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:16.900
- Six, this is Point. Over.
- Six here.

01:19:18.180 --> 01:19:20.380
The stuffs here, a lot of it.

01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:25.260
I'm also looking
at 100 to 150 men, armed,

01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:28.180
waiting around for something. Over.

01:19:28.340 --> 01:19:30.820
Colombian Army? Over.

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.460
Negative.
They look like mercenaries.

01:19:36.620 --> 01:19:40.060
- Over.
- Alright. Get back here.

01:19:40.220 --> 01:19:44.100
Abort mission.
I say again, abort mission. Out.

01:19:45.300 --> 01:19:48.140
150 armed men?

01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:09.900
Raise your arms, please.

01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:29.460
Thank you for responding to my note.
And so promptly.

01:20:29.620 --> 01:20:33.340
I had nothing to do
with the death of Mr Jacobs.

01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:37.900
It was an act of madness.
But typical of the men I work for.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:43.340
- What do you want?
- Same as you. Mineral water.

01:20:44.180 --> 01:20:48.860
You agree that as long as Americans
want drugs, someone will supply them?

01:20:49.020 --> 01:20:51.900
I don't want to be here
any longer than I have to.

01:20:52.060 --> 01:20:55.220
You mentioned a gang war.
What does that mean?

01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:59.740
- That we want the same thing.
- Same thing? Really?

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:02.380
Only, so far,
you've done all the work.

01:21:02.540 --> 01:21:04.700
You took care of the little fish.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.460
I will take care of
the one that got away.

01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:12.220
Once Escobedo is gone,
I will be in a position to help you.

01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:16.460
- You want to help me?
- Your country. Your people.

01:21:16.620 --> 01:21:19.060
By restructuring the drug trade.

01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:23.100
By regulating it. What would you say

01:21:23.260 --> 01:21:27.860
if I promised to halve the cocaine
shipments to the US?

01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:33.220
I'd say you'd been using
too much of your product.

01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:37.060
I can also promise you
regular quotas on major arrests

01:21:37.220 --> 01:21:40.180
that your police
can take credit for.

01:21:40.340 --> 01:21:43.900
Imagine. Dramatic seizures.
Drastic reductions.

01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:48.780
No more senseless violence.
You'll have your victory.

01:21:52.780 --> 01:21:54.540
In return for what?

01:21:55.740 --> 01:21:59.340
I also need a victory,
to establish my position

01:21:59.500 --> 01:22:04.180
with what is left of the cartel,
so I can help you.

01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:09.380
I need to defeat those soldiers
blowing up everything they see.

01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:15.460
Give me maps of their locations.
Cut off their communications.

01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:27.460
DEA's sending the audio surveillance
tape. They haven't got it yet.

01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:34.660
You know what you think about
when you're lying here?

01:22:36.380 --> 01:22:40.060
You know you're gonna die,
and you think...

01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:45.300
...that's alright.
You lived a long time.

01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:47.980
You had a family that loved you.

01:22:48.140 --> 01:22:52.620
You had a job that you thought
made a difference.

01:22:53.220 --> 01:22:56.180
That you thought was honourable.

01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:59.660
And then you see this.

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:06.380
I'm afraid if I dig any deeper...

01:23:07.460 --> 01:23:10.580
...no one's gonna like what I find.

01:23:15.380 --> 01:23:17.380
You took an oath...

01:23:18.780 --> 01:23:21.460
...if you recall...

01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:26.980
...when you first came
to work for me.

01:23:27.140 --> 01:23:32.740
And I don't mean to the National
Security Advisor of the US.

01:23:33.620 --> 01:23:35.980
I mean to his boss.

01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:39.700
And I don't mean the President.

01:23:41.100 --> 01:23:44.460
You gave your word to...

01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:47.980
...his boss.

01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:49.980
You gave your word...

01:23:51.020 --> 01:23:55.460
...to the people
of the United States.

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:59.300
Your word is who you are.

01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:07.060
What else have you got there?

01:24:11.820 --> 01:24:14.700
I brought you some new magazines.

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:27.780
The situation in East Timor seems
to have stabilised during the day.

01:24:27.940 --> 01:24:29.380
Good.

01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:33.580
- Is that it?
- Except for the other thing.

01:24:34.020 --> 01:24:37.180
We've accomplished a lot.
We're seeing results.

01:24:37.340 --> 01:24:41.260
Drug shipments are down.
Price on the street is rising.

01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:45.860
The perception is the administration
is doing something right.

01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:48.540
What's the bad news?

01:24:50.540 --> 01:24:56.020
I'm worried about the car bomb coming
so soon after Jacobs's assassination.

01:24:57.500 --> 01:25:00.420
Just the kind of thing
reporters live for.

01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:04.540
- They'd love to make a connection.
- And you think they will?

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:09.700
I think it's time
the whole thing went away.

01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:13.340
- If that's what you think.
- I think so.

01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:19.660
Then it should go away.
It never happened.

01:25:24.180 --> 01:25:27.820
Well, it's possible.

01:25:27.980 --> 01:25:33.020
It would be easier if you told me
whose system you want to break into.

01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:35.100
- Morning, Dr Ryan.
- Morning.

01:25:53.580 --> 01:25:57.580
Well, we're way beyond birthdays now.

01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:03.660
I'm gonna have to write
a special program here.

01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.700
Right.

01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:17.260
OK, sweetheart, let's get to work.

01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:20.660
Fine, good.

01:26:21.660 --> 01:26:24.700
Yes. Here we go.

01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:01.740
Jesus!

01:27:20.220 --> 01:27:23.300
Reciprocity. What's that?

01:27:34.900 --> 01:27:36.620
- Yeah?
- I forgot to tell you,

01:27:36.780 --> 01:27:38.220
after you get the code,

01:27:38.380 --> 01:27:41.780
wait until he's off his system
before you log on.

01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:45.540
- He will know it when you do.
- Jesus, Petey, it's too late.

01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:48.140
Oh, my God!

01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:19.340
Cutter.

01:28:32.380 --> 01:28:33.420
Yeah?

01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:37.260
- Bob, Jack Ryan here.
- Good morning, Jack.

01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:41.580
Listen, maybe we got off
to a bad start.

01:28:41.740 --> 01:28:46.620
We're going to work together.
We should get to know each other.

01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:50.900
Do you play tennis?
Tennis? Do you play tennis?

01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:55.220
- Yeah, I play tennis.
- How about we get together?

01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:58.540
Next week?
Hour before we startwork?

01:29:05.540 --> 01:29:07.460
- Jack?
- Yeah.

01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:11.660
Computer theft is a serious crime.

01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:18.700
So are crimes
against the Constitution.

01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:22.140
Son of a bitch!

01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:35.500
Son of a bitch!

01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:41.740
Come on, come on.

01:29:44.060 --> 01:29:46.060
Clark.

01:29:57.620 --> 01:29:59.060
Yeah.

01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:23.380
You'll go to jail, pal.

01:30:23.540 --> 01:30:26.940
What is that? What do you think
you have there?

01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:28.700
You broke the law.

01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:33.620
You are such a Boy Scout.

01:30:33.780 --> 01:30:37.020
Look at you. You see everything
in black and white.

01:30:37.180 --> 01:30:40.980
No, not black and white, Ritter.
Right and wrong!

01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:45.220
- You see? There you go again.
- Why was I kept out of it?

01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:48.860
You're neck deep in it.
You went before Congress.

01:30:49.020 --> 01:30:51.900
You got the money for it.
You lied under oath...

01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:56.340
- I never lied to Congress!
- You told them no troops.

01:30:56.500 --> 01:30:59.940
- There are troops!
- You know I didn't know that.

01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:05.540
No. I have no recollection of that.
That's the term you have to learn.

01:31:05.700 --> 01:31:09.500
- Who authorised this?
- Sure, they'll ask you that.

01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:14.340
- Who authorised this?
- I have no recollection, Senator.

01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:23.340
I did not sign up for somebody's
bullshit political agenda.

01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:27.260
Who authorised this? Cutter?

01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:30.940
Cutter couldn't tie his shoes
without permission.

01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:38.300
- If I go down, you're going with me.
- Wrong again.

01:31:38.460 --> 01:31:42.500
I have an autographed
"Get Out of Jail Free" card.

01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:48.100
"The President authorises the Deputy
Director CIA, Robert Ritter,

01:31:48.260 --> 01:31:53.420
to conduct Operation Reciprocity
including all support necessary."

01:31:53.580 --> 01:31:58.180
"This operation is deemed important
to the national security of the US."

01:31:58.340 --> 01:31:59.940
Etc, etc, etc.

01:32:01.740 --> 01:32:06.220
You don't have one of these,
do you, Jack?

01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:19.500
Grey! The world is grey, Jack.

01:32:50.740 --> 01:32:55.620
Got any idea how I'm gonna
get out of this mess?

01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:58.460
Absolutely none.

01:33:07.020 --> 01:33:10.460
Yeah. This is he.

01:33:14.460 --> 01:33:16.740
When?

01:33:20.740 --> 01:33:22.740
James?

01:33:24.340 --> 01:33:26.180
Thank you.

01:33:26.500 --> 01:33:33.860
Admiral James Greer devoted his life
to his country and his family,

01:33:34.020 --> 01:33:38.140
giving selflessly
of both his wisdom and his love.

01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:42.860
He served his country
for more than 50 years.

01:33:43.020 --> 01:33:47.980
Enlisting in the Navy at 17.
Graduating from the Academy.

01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:51.620
Achieving three stars for his flag.

01:33:51.780 --> 01:33:55.500
He lived through tumultuous events
in his country's life.

01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:59.620
He participated in them. He made
them clearer to the rest of us,

01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:05.780
with his knowledge, his honesty,
his integrity and his courage.

01:34:14.820 --> 01:34:17.220
I can't see them,
but I know they're there.

01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:20.860
Five kilometres due east
from your position.

01:34:25.260 --> 01:34:28.460
Keep pushing forward.
We'll trap them.

01:34:28.620 --> 01:34:31.980
Never, though, was he deluded
into thinking that one man

01:34:32.140 --> 01:34:34.940
could solve the ills of the world.

01:34:35.540 --> 01:34:39.540
Always the soldier, on the
battlefields of the South Pacific,

01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:44.580
Korea, Vietnam and Washington,
he fought as part of a unit

01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:46.980
to preserve the ideals...

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:50.460
- Knife, this is Variable, over.
...of his nation.

01:34:50.620 --> 01:34:52.980
Knife! This is Variable, over.

01:34:54.300 --> 01:34:58.340
To the refuge of the earth,
we entrust our friend's body.

01:34:58.500 --> 01:35:03.060
To the protection of our God
in Heaven, we entrust his soul.

01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:07.380
To ourselves, we entrust his spirit

01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:10.500
and the principles he lived by.

01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:13.380
We're gonna miss you, James.

01:35:35.140 --> 01:35:37.980
Variable, this is Knife, over.

01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:41.020
Variable, this is Knife, over.

01:35:41.180 --> 01:35:44.540
Variable, I am not receiving.
We are under heavy attack.

01:35:44.700 --> 01:35:47.940
- Need air support, over.
- Go, go, go!

01:36:08.260 --> 01:36:11.940
Variable, this is Knife, over!
Switch!

01:36:42.980 --> 01:36:46.820
Variable, this is Knife!
Where the hell are you?

01:37:01.300 --> 01:37:04.780
Present arms.

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:11.820
On behalf of a grateful nation,
our condolences.

01:37:11.980 --> 01:37:15.580
- He was a very great patriot.
- Thank you.

01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:25.780
All aim.

01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:54.460
- Hello?
- Jean Fowler for Dr Jack Ryan.

01:37:54.620 --> 01:37:56.260
This is he.

01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:59.660
Jack? You've got to hear this.

01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:02.300
Picked it up this morning.

01:38:02.460 --> 01:38:08.140
Variable, this is Knife. We are
under attack, need air support.

01:38:08.300 --> 01:38:11.460
Variable, this is Knife,
where the hell are you?

01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:15.020
Jack, what do you want me
to do with this?

01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:20.260
Make a copy, Jean.
Make ten copies.

01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:23.380
Get them to me
as quick as you can. Thanks.

01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:30.740
Jesus. They're going to leave
those guys down there.

01:39:11.580 --> 01:39:17.420
He's on American 915.
He'll be in Bogota 7:50pm.

01:39:28.860 --> 01:39:30.780
- Yeah?
- It's Ritter.

01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:34.500
- Where the fuck have you been?
- We have a problem.

01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:37.460
We've got a disaster!
I can't get through to my men.

01:39:38.140 --> 01:39:41.500
We had to shut down
the satellite link.

01:39:42.860 --> 01:39:45.740
- Clark?
- You had to what?

01:39:47.020 --> 01:39:52.700
It's Ryan. He found out everything.
He threatened to walk up the Hill

01:39:52.860 --> 01:39:55.660
if we didn't
shut down the operation.

01:39:55.820 --> 01:40:01.340
OK. It's shut down. Just give me
some air and my men are out of there.

01:40:02.740 --> 01:40:08.740
Clark, maybe you're not hearing me.
There is no air. We are shut down.

01:40:10.420 --> 01:40:13.700
I'm on a plane.
I'm gonna kill him.

01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:17.020
Ritter?

01:40:18.700 --> 01:40:21.140
Don't get on a plane.
He's coming to you.

01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:25.140
American Airlines at 1950 hours
with no security.

01:40:25.300 --> 01:40:29.380
- Who is this?
- National Security Advisor Cutter.

01:40:29.540 --> 01:40:32.420
Once Ryan's gone, we're back on line.

01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:34.980
You understand?

01:40:36.060 --> 01:40:38.300
Yes, sir.

01:41:55.420 --> 01:41:56.980
Clark.

01:41:57.140 --> 01:41:58.900
- Jesus!
- Get in the van.

01:41:59.060 --> 01:42:01.300
Don't be an asshole,
I came to find you.

01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:03.700
You found me. Get in.

01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:06.380
Alright.

01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:09.300
Behind the wheel.

01:42:10.740 --> 01:42:12.620
Clark.

01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:15.900
Drive.

01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:44.500
- Ritter.
- Ryan's dead.

01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:47.500
How?

01:42:48.660 --> 01:42:51.700
I killed him. Turn the op back on.

01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:59.660
You said get rid of Ryan
and we're back in business, right?

01:43:23.660 --> 01:43:25.740
What the hell are you doing here?

01:43:28.020 --> 01:43:31.100
I came to help you
get those guys out.

01:43:32.580 --> 01:43:35.180
What can you do to help me?

01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:43.260
What do you need?

01:43:43.420 --> 01:43:44.940
A helicopter.

01:43:47.220 --> 01:43:49.900
A helicopter.

01:43:57.620 --> 01:43:58.940
No, thank you.

01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:04.900
- Is this happy hour?
- It's always happy hour.

01:44:05.060 --> 01:44:08.700
- Your pilot owns thisjoint?
- He lives here.

01:44:13.980 --> 01:44:15.380
Here he is.

01:44:26.020 --> 01:44:27.860
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:44:28.020 --> 01:44:30.740
Morning. I'm here to rent the Huey.

01:44:30.900 --> 01:44:35.300
Sorry, we don't rent it any more.
But it is for sale.

01:44:36.300 --> 01:44:38.260
How much is it?

01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:42.060
Two million dollars.

01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:49.820
My pilot and I would
have to do a test flight.

01:44:49.980 --> 01:44:53.060
Of course.
You just have to leave a deposit.

01:44:54.660 --> 01:44:56.500
How much is that?

01:44:56.660 --> 01:44:58.220
Two million dollars.

01:45:03.660 --> 01:45:06.860
Would you take a company cheque?

01:45:13.100 --> 01:45:14.660
Yes.

01:45:22.140 --> 01:45:26.260
- Here we go.
- Big son of a bitch, ain't she?

01:45:27.820 --> 01:45:32.100
- Do you have any time in this type?
- Nine o'clock.

01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:47.300
- Get out of my chopper.
- No. Mychopper. Let's go.

01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:10.300
Their last communication
put them here.

01:46:11.460 --> 01:46:16.380
The closest extraction point is here,
in this gorge.

01:46:17.340 --> 01:46:18.900
I got it.

01:46:37.700 --> 01:46:41.260
- Is that a body down there?
- Yeah.

01:46:43.060 --> 01:46:46.620
- One of ours?
- One of mine.

01:46:49.860 --> 01:46:54.460
Find a place to set her down.
We'll look for the others.

01:47:35.860 --> 01:47:40.380
Nowhere to run to.
No place to hide.

01:47:40.540 --> 01:47:45.580
Blood trails everywhere.
They all lead to the river.

01:47:58.260 --> 01:48:02.220
These are the falls
we saw from the air.

01:48:02.380 --> 01:48:05.980
The bodies should be
about 50 metres down.

01:48:17.300 --> 01:48:22.180
You left us!
You left us with no support at all!

01:48:22.340 --> 01:48:24.540
Fuck, you left us out to dry!

01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:26.700
- You son of a bitch!
- Easy! Easy!

01:48:29.540 --> 01:48:32.700
- It's not his fault.
- Whose fault is it?

01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:36.780
It's my fault.

01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:43.380
It's my fault.

01:48:54.580 --> 01:48:58.500
I was on point
when the last attack came.

01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:01.740
Over a mile away.

01:49:02.780 --> 01:49:04.980
By the time I got back, it was over.

01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:09.460
They were taking the Captain and Oso.

01:49:10.220 --> 01:49:11.540
The others?

01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:14.860
I buried them.

01:49:23.340 --> 01:49:25.420
Road to the town.

01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:28.780
They loaded the prisoners here.
Blood everywhere.

01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:32.580
- God knows where they are now.
- Escobedo knows.

01:49:32.740 --> 01:49:35.900
What are you going to do?
Knock on his door?

01:49:42.260 --> 01:49:47.100
Morning. I'd like to see Ernesto
Escobedo. I have no appointment.

01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:50.580
Gracias.

01:50:00.020 --> 01:50:02.100
OK.

01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:05.700
Hands up.

01:50:06.300 --> 01:50:08.180
Hands up!

01:50:09.660 --> 01:50:11.900
Wallet.

01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:18.780
It's a tape recorder.

01:50:22.180 --> 01:50:24.660
He's in.

01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:29.980
Bird, this is Variable, over.

01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:35.580
Bird, this is Variable, over.

01:50:50.860 --> 01:50:54.620
Dr Ryan. Come in.

01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:11.620
Sit down. What can I do for you?

01:51:12.820 --> 01:51:18.300
I didn't know who else to turn to.
I have a problem.

01:51:19.460 --> 01:51:23.020
An associate of mine,
a coffee buyer and his assistant,

01:51:23.180 --> 01:51:25.980
were on a business trip
in this area.

01:51:26.140 --> 01:51:29.780
They unexpectedly disappeared
yesterday. I'm very concerned.

01:51:29.940 --> 01:51:32.060
Coffee buyer?

01:51:32.220 --> 01:51:34.860
It's very important to me
to find them.

01:51:35.020 --> 01:51:38.140
Coffee buying is becoming
a dangerous business.

01:51:39.260 --> 01:51:43.860
Yes. Well, it was for Peter Hardin.

01:51:46.700 --> 01:51:50.100
- Who?
- He was a client of Lindo Coffee.

01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:54.860
- Lindo Coffee has many clients.
- You must have heard of this one.

01:51:55.020 --> 01:51:58.700
He owed your company
a great deal of money.

01:51:58.860 --> 01:52:02.700
Well, I'll have to talk to accounting
about that.

01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:06.420
$650 million.

01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:11.540
And change.

01:52:12.860 --> 01:52:17.740
Are you offering to help me with
the collection of an unpaid debt?

01:52:17.900 --> 01:52:20.900
- No.
- What are you offering?

01:52:22.140 --> 01:52:26.620
Atrade.
Felix Cortez has sold you out.

01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:29.300
His next move is to murder you,
your family,

01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:31.060
and take over the cartel.

01:52:31.220 --> 01:52:33.100
Where's my tape recorder?

01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:41.180
Play the tape.

01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:15.700
Let's move.

01:53:43.940 --> 01:53:47.180
I'd like you to meet
my new friend, Dr Ryan.

01:53:47.340 --> 01:53:50.500
Doctor? Why? Is somebody sick?

01:54:03.340 --> 01:54:04.980
What does he want?

01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:10.260
The safe return of his associates.

01:54:10.420 --> 01:54:14.500
And what does he offer us in return?

01:54:14.660 --> 01:54:17.060
You.

01:54:22.500 --> 01:54:26.700
Whatever this man has told you
is a lie. He lies for a living.

01:54:26.860 --> 01:54:31.300
He's in the intelligence business.
You're in the intelligence business!

01:54:37.420 --> 01:54:40.260
You've taken care of the little fish.

01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:43.020
I will take care
of the one that got away.

01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:47.700
Once Escobedo is gone,
I will be in a position to help you.

01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:51.900
So, the question is...

01:54:53.180 --> 01:54:55.580
...what am I supposed to do with you?

01:54:58.540 --> 01:55:01.460
Well? I guess I'm supposed
to kill you with this bat!

01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:11.940
Get up.

01:55:16.300 --> 01:55:20.460
Dramatic seizures. Drastic
reductions, no more violence...

01:55:20.620 --> 01:55:23.860
You'll have your victory.

01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:26.140
In return for what?

01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:06.700
- Where are they?
- They're here.

01:56:08.540 --> 01:56:13.380
Kill the plant. The American
killed Ernesto! Let's go!

01:56:59.180 --> 01:57:01.500
Bird to Variable, over.

01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:15.580
Bird, this is Variable.

01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:17.980
Where the hell are you?

01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:22.700
I'm cruising about five clicks
south of the village.

01:57:23.580 --> 01:57:27.500
- Stay there. I'll get back to you.
- Roger that.

01:57:38.860 --> 01:57:41.580
- No one.
- The prisoners!

01:58:26.180 --> 01:58:29.340
Come on, guys. Let's go, son.

01:58:30.300 --> 01:58:32.980
We're going home, boys.

01:59:42.980 --> 01:59:45.620
Pick us up
at the Lindo Coffee factory.

02:01:18.100 --> 02:01:21.900
Not only can I expose you
to the press, so can the soldiers.

02:01:22.060 --> 02:01:28.500
Do you want to take your chances
with the courts and the reporters?

02:01:28.660 --> 02:01:33.140
Do you want to end the career
of your commander in chief?

02:02:15.340 --> 02:02:17.580
Let's go!

02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:46.900
Get your asses in here!
Come on, we got to go!

02:02:49.780 --> 02:02:51.940
Come on!

02:02:58.340 --> 02:03:00.580
Hold it! We wait for Ryan!

02:03:00.740 --> 02:03:02.700
Yeah? We're out of here!

02:03:09.660 --> 02:03:12.660
Set it down! He's down there!

02:03:24.260 --> 02:03:25.860
Come on!

02:03:44.380 --> 02:03:46.140
I've got you!

02:03:52.740 --> 02:03:55.180
Chavez, cover me!

02:04:03.660 --> 02:04:06.900
Your hand. Give me your hand!

02:05:09.740 --> 02:05:12.740
The President will see you now, sir.

02:05:24.500 --> 02:05:27.700
Jack! I'm glad you're here.

02:05:28.820 --> 02:05:32.780
Sit down.
Can I get you anything?

02:05:32.940 --> 02:05:35.180
No.

02:05:35.340 --> 02:05:39.460
- Come on, sit down.
- I would prefer to stand, sir.

02:05:41.460 --> 02:05:47.700
Some things have gone on here
that I'm just becoming aware of.

02:05:47.860 --> 02:05:51.940
I was kept in the dark, as you were,
for a very long time.

02:05:52.100 --> 02:05:55.220
- Troubling things.
- Yeah.

02:05:55.380 --> 02:05:59.540
Now we have to sort them out, figure
out who is responsible for what

02:05:59.700 --> 02:06:03.300
and what to do about it.
We have to do this very delicately,

02:06:03.460 --> 02:06:07.220
otherwise people might
get the wrong idea.

02:06:07.380 --> 02:06:09.500
We have to lie.

02:06:10.540 --> 02:06:15.020
- Did I say that?
- No, you didn't.

02:06:15.180 --> 02:06:18.700
- You're upset.
- I'm upset.

02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:24.180
It's understandable. Do you mind
if I give you a bit of advice?

02:06:24.340 --> 02:06:26.540
You know this because you're smart.

02:06:26.700 --> 02:06:30.580
Never make important decisions
while you're upset.

02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:36.060
You did. American soldiers and
civilians are dead because of it.

02:06:36.220 --> 02:06:39.980
- I never ordered any...
- No. Don't play that game with me!

02:06:40.140 --> 02:06:44.140
You won't dishonour their memories
by pretending you didn't know!

02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:47.940
- How dare you lecture...
- How dare you, sir?

02:06:48.100 --> 02:06:51.820
How dare you come here
and bark at me like a junkyard dog!

02:06:51.980 --> 02:06:55.180
I am the President
of the United States!

02:06:58.980 --> 02:07:02.380
It gives me no pleasure
to do it, sir.

02:07:02.540 --> 02:07:05.660
As Acting Deputy Director
of Intelligence it is my duty

02:07:05.820 --> 02:07:09.660
to report this matter
to the Senate Oversight Committee.

02:07:14.380 --> 02:07:16.460
You're not going to do that.

02:07:18.140 --> 02:07:20.020
- I'm not?
- No, no.

02:07:22.180 --> 02:07:25.980
You've got yourself
a chip in the big game now.

02:07:27.220 --> 02:07:29.340
You're going to tuck that away,

02:07:29.500 --> 02:07:32.940
save that for a time
when your own ass is on the line.

02:07:33.100 --> 02:07:36.060
And then you're going to pull it out.

02:07:36.220 --> 02:07:40.500
And I'm going to cash it in for you.
Right?

02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:45.620
I don't think I have anything more
to say to you, sir.

02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:52.100
The country can't afford another
scandal, Jack. To protect itself,

02:07:52.260 --> 02:07:57.540
it won't allow another deception
that goes all the way to the top.

02:07:57.700 --> 02:08:01.420
You'll take the blame. Cutter
and Ritter will take some, too,

02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:04.940
but it won't amount to much,
a slap on the wrist.

02:08:05.100 --> 02:08:10.020
Then $20,000 an hour
on the lecture circuit.

02:08:10.180 --> 02:08:13.820
The rest of the blame
will fall on Greer.

02:08:13.980 --> 02:08:17.780
Yeah, you'll take him down with you.

02:08:17.940 --> 02:08:20.540
You'll destroy his reputation.

02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:25.980
But that's as far as it will go.
The old Potomac two-step, Jack.

02:08:28.700 --> 02:08:32.380
I'm sorry, Mr President,
I don't dance.

02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:56.940
Ryan, have you got a minute?

02:08:57.100 --> 02:08:59.500
No.

02:08:59.660 --> 02:09:02.220
We need to talk!

02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:04.380
Ryan!

02:09:27.700 --> 02:09:33.180
The Committee will come to order.
The Chair will now call Dr Ryan.

02:09:53.260 --> 02:09:57.100
Dr Ryan, thank you for appearing
before the Committee today.

02:09:57.260 --> 02:09:58.900
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

02:09:59.420 --> 02:10:02.740
Please stand
and raise your right hand.

02:10:05.580 --> 02:10:09.380
Do you solemnly swear that
the testimony you're about to give

02:10:09.540 --> 02:10:11.260
is the truth, the whole truth

02:10:11.420 --> 02:10:14.060
and nothing but the truth,
so help you God?

02:10:16.460 --> 02:10:18.540
I do.

02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:25.220
Dr Ryan, you may consider yourself
under oath. Please be seated.
