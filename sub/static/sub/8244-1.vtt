01:30.175 --> 01:32.177
<i>My life fades…</i>

01:33.053 --> 01:34.680
<i>… the vision dims.</i>

01:35.597 --> 01:38.350
<i>All that remains are memories.</i>

01:39.560 --> 01:43.397
<i>I remember a time of chaos…</i>

01:44.189 --> 01:47.860
<i>… ruined dreams, this wasted land.</i>

01:48.902 --> 01:53.073
<i>But most of all,
I remember the Road Warrior…</i>

01:53.907 --> 01:56.118
<i>… the man we called Max.</i>

01:57.161 --> 02:00.956
<i>To understand who he was,
you have to go back to another time…</i>

02:01.790 --> 02:04.793
<i>… when the world was powered
by the black fuel…</i>

02:05.336 --> 02:09.590
<i>… and the deserts sprouted
great cities of pipe and steel.</i>

02:12.134 --> 02:14.762
<i>Gone now, swept away.</i>

02:15.512 --> 02:19.892
<i>For reasons long forgotten,
two mighty warrior tribes went to war…</i>

02:20.309 --> 02:23.562
<i>… and touched off a blaze
which engulfed them all.</i>

02:24.229 --> 02:28.233
<i>Without fuel they were nothing.
They'd built a house of straw.</i>

02:28.942 --> 02:32.279
<i>The thundering machines
sputtered and stopped.</i>

02:35.157 --> 02:39.662
<i>Their leaders talked and
talked and talked.</i>

02:42.873 --> 02:45.501
<i>But nothing could
stem the avalanche.</i>

02:46.752 --> 02:48.587
<i>Their world crumbled…</i>

02:49.546 --> 02:51.590
<i>… the cities exploded.</i>

02:52.424 --> 02:54.301
<i>A whirlwind of looting…</i>

02:55.219 --> 02:57.513
<i>… a firestorm of fear.</i>

02:58.514 --> 03:01.016
<i>Men began to feed on men.</i>

03:03.018 --> 03:06.063
<i>On the roads,
it was a white-line nightmare.</i>

03:06.772 --> 03:09.441
<i>Only those mobile
enough to scavenge…</i>

03:09.983 --> 03:12.736
<i>… brutal enough to
pillage, would survive.</i>

03:13.696 --> 03:16.115
<i>The gangs took over the highways…</i>

03:16.782 --> 03:20.160
<i>… ready to wage war
for a tank of juice.</i>

03:21.704 --> 03:24.248
<i>And in this maelstrom of decay…</i>

03:24.748 --> 03:27.584
<i>… ordinary men
were battered and smashed.</i>

03:28.419 --> 03:29.920
<i>Men like Max.</i>

03:30.671 --> 03:32.339
<i>The warrior Max.</i>

03:35.384 --> 03:38.470
<i>In the roar of an engine,
he lost everything…</i>

03:44.017 --> 03:46.145
<i>… and became a shell of a man.</i>

03:46.562 --> 03:49.064
<i>A burnt-out, desolate man.</i>

03:49.857 --> 03:53.944
<i>A man haunted by the
demons of his past.</i>

03:54.945 --> 03:58.490
<i>A man who wandered out
into the wasteland.</i>

04:00.325 --> 04:01.869
<i>And it was here…</i>

04:03.245 --> 04:05.122
<i>… in this blighted place…</i>

04:06.999 --> 04:09.251
<i>… that he learned to live again.</i>

10:36.888 --> 10:39.724
Don't hurt the snake. Put it down.

10:40.183 --> 10:43.395
Gently, gently. Nice. Nice.

10:43.562 --> 10:45.063
Now the iron.

10:48.275 --> 10:49.526
The gun.

10:50.777 --> 10:53.780
Down, down. Turn around.

11:06.501 --> 11:08.962
Looks like I got myself some gasoline, eh?

11:10.255 --> 11:11.298
V8?

11:12.132 --> 11:15.760
Booby-trapped.
Touch those tanks and:

11:23.935 --> 11:26.646
Booby trap. Back up.

11:27.981 --> 11:31.359
Oh, you crafty little man, you.

11:31.526 --> 11:34.362
You're quick, very quick.

11:35.655 --> 11:39.618
Never seen a man beat the snake before.
Who are you?

11:41.828 --> 11:45.123
Reflexes. Yeah. That's what you've got.

11:47.125 --> 11:49.294
Me, I got brains.

11:53.590 --> 11:54.591
Hey!

11:56.468 --> 11:59.262
A fella, a quick fella…

11:59.721 --> 12:04.100
… might have a weapon under there.
I'd have to pin his head to the panel.

12:16.154 --> 12:18.657
Hey. Hey, hey.

12:21.618 --> 12:23.536
Don't play me the fool.

12:30.335 --> 12:33.880
Gas, fuel, gasoline!
Thousands of gallons of it!

12:34.047 --> 12:36.216
- As much as you want!
- Where? Where?

12:36.383 --> 12:39.678
Twenty miles from here.
Pumping it, they are. Refining!

12:41.137 --> 12:43.098
- A huge tanker full.
- Crap.

12:43.265 --> 12:45.684
No. No, no, no, it's true! It's true.

12:45.976 --> 12:48.937
It's not self-service, no, no.
It's too hard for me.

12:49.104 --> 12:52.023
- But a man of your ingenuity…
- Where? Where? Where?

12:53.108 --> 12:55.527
Kill me and you'll never find out.

13:15.922 --> 13:18.508
Good dog. Nice doggy, eh?

13:19.592 --> 13:20.969
Good doggy.

13:27.684 --> 13:28.893
Bless you, dog.

13:52.917 --> 13:55.962
Well, there it is.

13:58.923 --> 14:00.925
Four days I was up here…

14:01.426 --> 14:05.430
… me and the snakes,
playing mahjong, taking tea…

14:06.514 --> 14:08.391
… watching, thinking…

14:09.267 --> 14:12.103
… how was I gonna
get in and get the gas?

14:14.230 --> 14:16.441
Day and night it's pumping.

14:19.611 --> 14:21.112
Fuel to burn.

14:22.238 --> 14:25.825
They've got the lot.
Power, lights, you name it.

14:26.951 --> 14:29.579
You can bet your life they mean to keep it.

14:30.455 --> 14:32.248
Thirty of them in there.

14:32.457 --> 14:34.918
Arrows, flamethrowers, guns.

14:36.294 --> 14:39.005
No place for man or reptile, I thought.

14:40.173 --> 14:42.300
Then this trash arrived…

14:43.384 --> 14:45.136
… as moths to a flame.

14:45.553 --> 14:48.348
Round and round, attack, attack…

14:49.224 --> 14:53.061
… like angry ants,
mad with the smell of gasoline.

15:08.993 --> 15:12.122
In the tanker, that's where they keep it.

15:13.331 --> 15:16.167
Thousands of gallons.
As much as you want.

15:18.670 --> 15:21.506
If anyone's gonna get in there,
it's gonna be you.

15:21.840 --> 15:25.135
Me, I'm gonna feed the snakes.

15:29.097 --> 15:32.767
A man lives by his word, I reckon,
and I've kept mine, eh?

15:42.193 --> 15:45.155
Look, we had a deal. I show you the gas
and you let me go, right?

15:45.321 --> 15:49.284
- The arrangement was I wouldn't kill you.
- After all I've done for you…

15:49.784 --> 15:52.412
I reckon you got a bargain, don't you?

16:20.773 --> 16:23.193
<i>Attack, my vermin, attack!</i>

16:47.675 --> 16:51.596
<i>Onward! Bring me the fuel.
For the glory of Humungus.</i>

16:51.888 --> 16:54.224
<i>For the great glory of Humungus.</i>

16:58.937 --> 17:01.064
<i>Smegma crazies to the left!</i>

17:04.025 --> 17:06.778
<i>The gate!
Gayboy berserkers to the gate!</i>

17:13.910 --> 17:15.453
<i>I am your Lord.</i>

17:20.458 --> 17:21.667
<i>Attack!</i>

24:08.699 --> 24:11.702
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

24:11.869 --> 24:13.079
Save it.

24:13.537 --> 24:15.790
I'm just here for the gasoline.

24:15.957 --> 24:17.249
Yeah. Yeah.

24:23.047 --> 24:24.840
As much as you like.

24:25.007 --> 24:26.968
Just take me back there.

25:13.889 --> 25:16.434
Show your weapons and come forward!

25:20.771 --> 25:22.148
Steady now.

25:24.191 --> 25:26.152
Take it real easy.

25:27.403 --> 25:29.321
That's as far as you go.

25:30.031 --> 25:31.449
Turn around.

25:32.450 --> 25:35.828
- Nathan! Nathan! It's Nathan!
- Hurry, get the stretcher!

25:35.995 --> 25:37.246
Lose them.

25:40.499 --> 25:42.001
Open the gate.

25:47.173 --> 25:49.550
Hurry up with that damned stretcher.

25:49.967 --> 25:51.010
Nathan!

25:51.177 --> 25:54.138
Hey, that's fine. It's fine.
Just stay here.

25:54.638 --> 25:56.432
Cover him. Cover him.

25:58.809 --> 26:00.686
Come on, quick. Quick.

26:01.562 --> 26:03.272
Oh, what a waste!

26:04.315 --> 26:05.983
Watch his leg.

26:08.986 --> 26:11.030
You and your handiwork!

26:11.197 --> 26:12.990
He didn't stand a chance!

26:13.157 --> 26:16.869
Oh, I warned him. You all heard me.
"Madness," I said.

26:17.119 --> 26:20.498
"We can escape, take our gas," he said.
"How?" I said.

26:20.664 --> 26:22.792
Get that machine inside.
Charlie, help me...

26:22.958 --> 26:24.168
Derek?

26:30.841 --> 26:32.510
Get that machine inside.

26:33.177 --> 26:34.762
Close the damned gate.

26:34.929 --> 26:37.181
Mind your backs, mind your backs.
Coming through.

26:49.527 --> 26:51.904
All right, give him room, give him room.

26:55.449 --> 26:56.867
Who are you?

26:57.910 --> 27:00.037
How did you get through out there?

27:00.204 --> 27:03.123
Look, I want some answers.
Where did you find him?

27:03.541 --> 27:06.877
Two or three miles down the road,
left for dead. We had a deal.

27:07.044 --> 27:09.338
There were three other vehicles.
Did you see them?

27:09.505 --> 27:11.882
They're heading to the southwest
in heaps of trouble.

27:12.049 --> 27:14.552
He said if I brought him back,
you'd give me some gas.

27:14.718 --> 27:17.888
- Now, there's not much time.
- There was a woman in the car.

27:18.973 --> 27:20.349
She's dead.

27:22.059 --> 27:23.269
What did they do?

27:23.435 --> 27:26.230
It was quick. I just want my gas,
I wanna get out of here.

27:26.397 --> 27:28.774
For all we know, he's one of them.
Give him nothing.

27:28.941 --> 27:30.609
She's right, he's a parasite.

27:30.776 --> 27:33.654
Trading in human flesh. Mercenary trash.

27:34.822 --> 27:37.825
- We had an arrangement.
- What do you mean, an arrangement?

27:37.992 --> 27:39.743
You talk to this man.

27:40.536 --> 27:43.956
No, no. Try something. Try something.

27:57.344 --> 28:00.055
If you had a contract, it was with him.

28:00.222 --> 28:01.932
And it died with him.

28:02.099 --> 28:04.101
- Get rid of him.
- Move it.

28:04.435 --> 28:05.603
Left!

28:08.230 --> 28:09.440
Left.

28:13.235 --> 28:16.530
Gotta hand it to you, treasure.
The last of the V8 Interceptors.

28:16.697 --> 28:18.407
A piece of history.

28:20.034 --> 28:22.328
Would have been a shame to blow it up.

28:31.754 --> 28:33.255
Let him go!

28:35.925 --> 28:36.926
It's all right, mate.

28:37.092 --> 28:39.202
Here they come! Close the gates!

28:39.402 --> 28:40.721
They're coming back!

29:50.291 --> 29:54.420
Hold your fire! He comes in peace!

29:54.795 --> 29:59.216
For Christ's sake, hold your fire!

30:52.102 --> 30:54.438
Greetings from the Humungus!

30:55.105 --> 30:56.774
The Lord Humungus!

30:57.524 --> 31:00.277
The Warrior of the Wasteland!

31:02.404 --> 31:06.116
The Ayatollah of Rock 'n' Roll-ah!

31:08.786 --> 31:11.038
I am gravely disappointed.

31:11.622 --> 31:14.792
Again you have made me
unleash my dogs of war.

31:15.459 --> 31:17.294
- Look at what remains…
- Help!

31:17.461 --> 31:19.463
- … of your gallant scouts.
- Kill him now…

31:19.630 --> 31:22.925
- Why? Because you're selfish,
- … while you've got the chance.

31:23.092 --> 31:24.802
You hoard your gasoline.

31:25.469 --> 31:28.222
- You will not listen to reason.
- Don't listen to him!

31:28.389 --> 31:30.474
Now, my prisoners say…

31:30.724 --> 31:34.061
… you plan to take your gasoline
out of the wasteland.

31:34.478 --> 31:37.856
You sent them out this morning
to find a vehicle.

31:38.398 --> 31:42.694
A rig big enough to haul
that fat tank of gas.

31:43.487 --> 31:45.155
What a puny plan.

31:45.781 --> 31:47.366
Look around you.

31:49.576 --> 31:51.954
This is the Valley of Death.

31:52.121 --> 31:53.163
See!

31:53.914 --> 31:57.835
Nothing can escape!
The Humungus rules the wasteland!

31:58.001 --> 32:02.172
Give them nothing. Blow it up.
Give them...

32:03.966 --> 32:06.885
Humungus will not be defied.

32:28.574 --> 32:30.325
Wez. Wez.

32:30.868 --> 32:32.369
Listen to me!

32:39.251 --> 32:41.044
I got it. I got it.

32:49.261 --> 32:50.262
Good one.

32:55.517 --> 32:58.687
Quiet. Quiet. No more games.

32:59.771 --> 33:01.315
No more games!

33:02.024 --> 33:03.859
We are here for a purpose.

33:04.401 --> 33:06.236
We've come with an offer.

33:09.740 --> 33:13.076
No. No more talk.

33:13.285 --> 33:15.579
We go in. We kill.

33:15.746 --> 33:17.873
We'll kill them!

33:20.584 --> 33:24.004
We'll kill them! Kill them. Kill them!

33:26.256 --> 33:27.925
Do you see him?

33:31.094 --> 33:33.096
Kill! Kill!

33:36.141 --> 33:38.060
Be still, my dog of war.

33:38.310 --> 33:40.229
I understand your pain.

33:40.520 --> 33:44.441
We all lost someone we love.
But we do it my way.

33:44.608 --> 33:46.568
Losers. Losers wait.

33:46.777 --> 33:48.779
We do it my way.

33:48.946 --> 33:53.575
Their fear is our ally.
The gasoline will be ours.

33:54.326 --> 33:56.912
Then you shall have your revenge.

34:02.292 --> 34:03.669
Take him away.

34:18.516 --> 34:22.396
There has been too much violence,
too much pain.

34:23.146 --> 34:25.148
None here are without sin.

34:26.567 --> 34:28.652
But I have an honorable compromise.

34:29.652 --> 34:31.196
Just walk away.

34:31.822 --> 34:33.489
Give me the pump…

34:33.864 --> 34:35.158
… the oil…

34:35.784 --> 34:37.286
… the gasoline…

34:37.744 --> 34:41.290
… and the whole compound,
and I'll spare your lives.

34:41.998 --> 34:46.420
Just walk away. I will give you
safe passage in the wasteland.

34:47.004 --> 34:50.674
Just walk away
and there will be an end to the horror.

34:56.179 --> 34:57.931
I await your answer.

34:58.390 --> 35:00.726
You have one full day to decide.

35:28.211 --> 35:30.047
We'll never walk away!

35:31.381 --> 35:32.549
Never!

35:54.196 --> 35:57.282
You heard what he said.
It sounds reasonable.

35:57.866 --> 36:00.077
We don't have to die.

36:00.577 --> 36:02.788
All we have to do is walk away.

36:02.954 --> 36:04.289
No. We've worked too hard.

36:04.456 --> 36:08.543
It's simple. All we do is change the fuel
and this junkyard for our lives.

36:08.710 --> 36:11.088
Look, if we walk out there,
they'll slaughter us.

36:11.254 --> 36:14.466
They'll set us loose
and then cut us down like pigs.

36:14.633 --> 36:16.009
Don't listen to them.

36:16.176 --> 36:18.595
All right. All right. This is it.

36:18.970 --> 36:21.098
I'll talk to this Humungus.

36:21.598 --> 36:22.599
Fool.

36:22.766 --> 36:24.643
He's a reasonable man…

36:25.644 --> 36:27.604
… open to negotiation.

36:28.063 --> 36:31.066
He promised us safe passage.
He gave his word.

36:31.233 --> 36:33.485
And let us suppose he keeps it…

36:34.111 --> 36:37.697
… and we walk away from here
with our lives. What then?

37:46.975 --> 37:48.477
But remember.

37:48.643 --> 37:52.272
Remember one thing.
That is more than just a tanker of gas.

37:52.439 --> 37:56.860
That is our lifeline to a place
beyond that vermin on machines.

37:57.527 --> 37:59.821
That's 2,000 miles from here!

38:00.489 --> 38:03.575
How do you expect us to get it there?
Drag it?

38:03.742 --> 38:06.536
If we have to, yes. There's always a way.

38:07.537 --> 38:09.247
But the first step…

38:10.290 --> 38:11.875
… defend the fuel.

38:13.126 --> 38:14.294
Words.

38:15.045 --> 38:16.421
Just words!

38:17.088 --> 38:18.715
You'd die for a pipe dream!

38:18.882 --> 38:21.718
Wrong. We fight for a belief. I stay.

38:30.852 --> 38:33.230
I wish it could have worked, Pappagallo.

38:33.396 --> 38:35.649
You can't expect to compete with that.

38:36.233 --> 38:39.778
Every day we get weaker
while they get stronger. It's finished.

38:40.403 --> 38:41.738
I'm sorry.

38:48.078 --> 38:51.623
Two days ago I saw a vehicle
that'd haul that tanker.

38:53.291 --> 38:55.502
You wanna get out of here…

38:56.127 --> 38:57.671
… you talk to me.

39:02.926 --> 39:04.928
Okay, so that's my offer.

39:05.262 --> 39:07.514
I deliver a rig big enough
to haul that tanker…

39:07.681 --> 39:11.101
… you give me back my vehicle
and as much juice as I can carry.

39:11.268 --> 39:13.436
We lost eight good people this morning.

39:15.939 --> 39:17.816
What's he got in mind?

39:18.358 --> 39:21.361
Now, to do the job
I need five gallons of diesel…

39:21.611 --> 39:23.530
… and some high-octane gasoline.

39:27.242 --> 39:29.160
Think of it as a down payment.

39:29.452 --> 39:31.955
And that's the last we'll ever see of him.

39:32.122 --> 39:34.291
He has to come back for his wheels.

39:34.708 --> 39:36.501
What have we got to lose?

39:38.795 --> 39:40.630
You've got yourself a deal.

40:05.280 --> 40:08.116
My vehicle and all the juice I can carry.

40:59.209 --> 41:00.669
Come on, dog.

43:54.717 --> 43:57.887
You know what I miss most of all?
Clean women.

43:58.930 --> 44:01.641
Nail polish, perfume…

44:02.392 --> 44:06.229
… the smell of bicycle seats, cocktails…

44:06.896 --> 44:08.565
- Shut up.
- Desserts.

44:09.440 --> 44:13.236
Lingerie. Remember lingerie?

44:24.038 --> 44:26.416
I knew it. I knew it'd work.

44:26.708 --> 44:30.628
Lethal. Lethal, these snakes. Born killers.

44:32.422 --> 44:33.423
Down!

44:33.590 --> 44:36.634
It's my snake. I trained it.
I'm gonna eat it.

44:37.051 --> 44:40.179
So find your own. Get out of it.

44:40.847 --> 44:43.766
I've got a recipe for snake. Delicious.

44:44.601 --> 44:47.228
Fricassee of reptile. Get out.

44:47.645 --> 44:49.898
Better than your dog food. No!

44:50.607 --> 44:53.985
Pure protein, minerals, vitamins.

44:54.485 --> 44:56.946
A man's gotta look after himself.

44:57.238 --> 44:59.616
Healthy mind, healthy body, dog.

44:59.824 --> 45:03.536
Hey! You are what you eat, I reckon.
Get away!

45:04.621 --> 45:07.457
You two ought to take a look
in the mirror some time.

45:07.624 --> 45:09.667
No style, no taste.

45:11.794 --> 45:12.962
Empty.

45:13.796 --> 45:15.632
All this time.

45:19.802 --> 45:22.764
That's dishonest. Low.

45:26.059 --> 45:28.603
Let's have a look at this machine of yours.

45:29.479 --> 45:31.814
How do I know that one's not a dud?

45:32.607 --> 45:35.568
- Find out.
- Cool. Cool, cool.

45:36.653 --> 45:40.323
Now, you've gotta understand the basics
of aerodynamics in a thing like this.

45:40.490 --> 45:41.824
Shut up. Shut up.

46:27.203 --> 46:30.415
What about me, eh?
You're not gonna leave me here, are you?

46:33.751 --> 46:35.211
Do what you want.

46:37.380 --> 46:39.298
We're partners.

46:47.598 --> 46:50.893
You and me, we're partners.

46:51.602 --> 46:53.062
Partners!

48:01.464 --> 48:02.632
Go. Go.

51:33.426 --> 51:36.053
My dogs, run. The gate.

51:40.766 --> 51:45.062
The gate. The gate. The gate.

53:05.101 --> 53:08.562
You. You can run, but you can't hide.

53:34.797 --> 53:36.799
You did a great job.

53:37.341 --> 53:38.843
That's my man.

53:39.593 --> 53:41.137
That's my man.

53:41.303 --> 53:43.264
Don't go overboard now.

53:44.432 --> 53:47.601
No, don't touch, please.
It's a precision instrument.

53:50.396 --> 53:52.189
Don't touch.

53:59.697 --> 54:01.157
Don't touch.

54:02.450 --> 54:03.492
Go.

54:06.996 --> 54:08.080
Go on.

54:11.417 --> 54:14.170
Tell me, son, this machine of yours…

54:15.504 --> 54:17.631
… it can take two, can it?

54:19.633 --> 54:20.885
Possibly.

54:26.182 --> 54:27.308
All right?

54:27.475 --> 54:30.936
I'm okay. Just get them organized,
we're moving out tonight.

54:35.107 --> 54:38.360
Okay, listen, everyone.
We're going out tonight.

54:38.527 --> 54:40.905
You all know what to do,
just get on with it.

54:41.071 --> 54:43.699
Timbo, Derek, Pappagallo's been hurt.

54:45.201 --> 54:46.702
How's the rig?

54:47.870 --> 54:49.538
The rig. How is she?

54:49.705 --> 54:51.040
A cracked timing case cover.

54:51.207 --> 54:53.209
It's broken some teeth
off the timing gears.

54:53.375 --> 54:55.085
It's got a cracked timing case cover.

54:55.252 --> 54:57.755
It's broken a couple of teeth
off the timing gears.

54:57.922 --> 55:01.300
- The radiator's damaged at the core.
- The radiator's damaged at the core.

55:01.467 --> 55:04.053
- A cracked water pump.
- It's got a cracked water pump.

55:04.220 --> 55:07.765
- And a fractured injector line.
- And it's got a fractured injector line.

55:07.932 --> 55:11.477
- Well, what does all that mean?
- Yeah, okay, but what does that mean?

55:12.019 --> 55:13.896
- What does that mean?
- Twenty-four hours.

55:14.063 --> 55:15.564
Twenty-four hours.

55:16.899 --> 55:18.275
They've got 12.

55:19.151 --> 55:20.903
- You've got 12.
- Okay.

55:21.070 --> 55:22.071
Okay.

55:22.238 --> 55:24.615
Let's get him down. Quick, come on.

55:30.037 --> 55:32.581
Listen, I was wrong about you…

55:32.998 --> 55:34.542
… and I'm sorry.

55:50.266 --> 55:51.392
Heel.

55:51.559 --> 55:54.436
It's been a long time
since I've seen driving like that, man.

55:54.603 --> 55:56.522
You're okay by me, son.

55:56.689 --> 56:00.359
With you driving that rig, we got it licked!
Nice to have you aboard, son.

56:00.526 --> 56:03.320
I've been saving those.
I want you to have them.

56:07.283 --> 56:09.159
Thank you, and welcome.

56:12.329 --> 56:15.249
It's been a pleasure doing business
with you, but I'm leaving.

56:15.416 --> 56:17.293
I'm leaving. Thanks.

56:24.300 --> 56:25.926
Oh, my God, look!

56:26.093 --> 56:27.636
Up on the hill!

56:28.304 --> 56:31.056
They're stringing them up, the bastards!

56:32.933 --> 56:34.018
Look!

56:40.316 --> 56:42.443
You have defied me.

56:43.277 --> 56:47.656
You will know the vengeance
of Lord Humungus.

56:48.782 --> 56:50.367
I promise you…

56:51.327 --> 56:52.828
… nobody…

56:53.412 --> 56:57.166
… nobody gets out of here alive.

57:48.258 --> 57:52.638
Who's supposed to be helping out
with the drums? Come on!

57:53.973 --> 57:56.892
Hey, don't forget,
don't waste a bit before we leave.

58:00.062 --> 58:01.605
Just wanna catch the pigs.

58:01.772 --> 58:04.066
Come on with the drums, come on!

58:04.233 --> 58:06.360
Is anybody helping over there?

58:10.197 --> 58:11.407
Hey, come on!

58:44.606 --> 58:47.693
What's wrong? Come on.

58:48.193 --> 58:51.655
It just seems really wrong,
sneaking away like this.

58:55.659 --> 58:58.829
But you said you wanted to come,
sweetheart.

58:59.038 --> 59:00.789
I know I did, but…

59:01.957 --> 59:05.252
Look, you're scared. Now, come on,
it'll be much safer up there.

59:05.419 --> 59:07.755
- What are we waiting for, eh?
- No, don't.

59:09.757 --> 59:11.467
This is my family.

59:12.968 --> 59:15.429
I'm not gonna leave these people.

59:16.680 --> 59:18.098
I'm staying.

59:20.392 --> 59:21.769
I'm sorry.

59:31.612 --> 59:34.698
Come on, keep it together.

59:51.924 --> 59:54.510
I told you, he's leaving.
What did I tell you?

59:54.676 --> 59:56.178
Look, he's leaving.

59:58.013 --> 01:00:02.392
Look, I don't have time for long speeches.
I want you to drive the tanker.

01:00:04.186 --> 01:00:05.354
Sorry.

01:00:06.855 --> 01:00:10.067
We had a contract.
I kept my part of the bargain.

01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:13.153
We'll make a new contract.

01:00:16.907 --> 01:00:18.909
I've got all I need here.

01:00:19.159 --> 01:00:23.330
You don't have a future.
I could offer you that. Rebuild our lives.

01:00:23.539 --> 01:00:24.581
Max…

01:00:24.832 --> 01:00:26.917
… buy a ticket for 2,000 miles.

01:00:27.084 --> 01:00:31.380
You have to come, sonny.
This is where we're going. Paradise.

01:00:32.214 --> 01:00:34.049
Two thousand miles from here.

01:00:34.383 --> 01:00:36.802
Fresh water, plenty of sunshine.

01:00:37.344 --> 01:00:39.346
Nothing to do but breed.

01:00:41.056 --> 01:00:42.391
No, thanks.

01:00:43.141 --> 01:00:46.144
What is it with you, huh?
What are you looking for?

01:00:46.812 --> 01:00:49.648
Come on, Max,
everyone's looking for something.

01:00:50.232 --> 01:00:52.484
You happy out there, are you?

01:00:52.693 --> 01:00:55.445
Wandering?
One day blurring into another?

01:00:56.363 --> 01:00:59.241
You're a scavenger, Max.
You're a maggot.

01:00:59.908 --> 01:01:01.159
Do you know that?

01:01:01.326 --> 01:01:04.079
You're living off the corpse
of the old world.

01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:06.790
Tell me your story.
Come on, tell me your story.

01:01:06.957 --> 01:01:08.458
What burned you out?

01:01:08.625 --> 01:01:10.127
Kill one man too many?

01:01:10.294 --> 01:01:12.629
See too many people die?
Lose some family?

01:01:12.796 --> 01:01:17.092
Oh, so that's it. You lost some family.
That make you something special, does it?

01:01:17.676 --> 01:01:18.927
Listen to me.

01:01:41.325 --> 01:01:44.119
Do you think
you're the only one that's suffered?

01:01:44.536 --> 01:01:48.248
We've all been through it in here.
But we haven't given up.

01:01:49.583 --> 01:01:52.294
We're still human beings with dignity.

01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:56.548
But you, you're out there
with the garbage.

01:01:57.090 --> 01:01:58.634
You're nothing.

01:02:40.300 --> 01:02:41.760
Get out, kid.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:46.682
Come on, get out of here.

01:03:07.995 --> 01:03:10.622
Go on, get out. Scat. Get out.

01:03:42.195 --> 01:03:44.072
You're letting him go?

01:03:45.907 --> 01:03:48.243
Well, let's keep his vehicle, at least.

01:03:49.036 --> 01:03:52.706
He fulfilled his contract.
He's an honorable man.

01:03:54.249 --> 01:03:56.918
Okay, so who's gonna drive the tanker?

01:03:58.253 --> 01:03:59.337
I am.

01:04:26.198 --> 01:04:28.658
They've got you wrong,
you're not a coward.

01:04:28.825 --> 01:04:31.286
Stupid maybe, but not a coward.

01:04:32.454 --> 01:04:34.790
You're making a serious mistake…

01:04:35.916 --> 01:04:38.001
… splitting a great team.

01:04:38.919 --> 01:04:41.671
You and me together,
think of the possibilities.

01:04:41.838 --> 01:04:44.800
See you around, maybe.
Goodbye, good luck.

01:05:12.369 --> 01:05:13.370
We go!

01:05:24.464 --> 01:05:27.175
You disobey me. You puppy.

01:06:29.905 --> 01:06:32.240
Toadie, the gas. Hurry up.

01:06:40.582 --> 01:06:43.418
Don't waste him. If he's alive…

01:06:44.419 --> 01:06:45.754
… I want him.

01:07:11.947 --> 01:07:16.284
The tanks are full, O, mighty Wez,
and it's all yours!

01:08:11.339 --> 01:08:12.841
It's all over.

01:08:13.758 --> 01:08:15.051
Let's go.

01:08:27.397 --> 01:08:29.858
Look, out there. Northwest.

01:08:38.033 --> 01:08:39.533
Oh, hell.

01:08:42.037 --> 01:08:43.872
You blew it, you fool.

01:10:01.157 --> 01:10:03.702
Relax, partner.

01:11:40.089 --> 01:11:41.966
I'll be driving the tanker.

01:11:43.092 --> 01:11:46.095
We're gonna crash or crash through.

01:11:47.764 --> 01:11:51.100
Now at this point, that's all they want.
The tanker.

01:11:51.726 --> 01:11:53.853
So they'll come straight after us.

01:11:54.020 --> 01:11:56.731
So we'll use that to punch our way out…

01:11:57.023 --> 01:11:59.901
… which will give all of you
a very, very good chance.

01:12:00.401 --> 01:12:01.903
Now, don't hesitate.

01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:06.157
Once you're outside there,
split up and go as hard as you can.

01:12:07.534 --> 01:12:09.494
Now, 200 miles to the north…

01:12:10.203 --> 01:12:14.582
… there's a place with a bridge
called Powder River.

01:12:14.999 --> 01:12:16.918
That's our rendezvous.

01:12:18.253 --> 01:12:20.046
Give us till sunset.

01:12:21.089 --> 01:12:24.676
If we haven't made it by then, keep going.

01:12:25.552 --> 01:12:27.720
Good enough for me to build,
but not to ride on?

01:12:27.887 --> 01:12:30.473
- You are not coming on this tanker!
- I sweated blood on this…

01:12:30.640 --> 01:12:33.351
… and no bastard's gonna tell me
to ride in no school bus!

01:12:33.518 --> 01:12:35.103
Okay, settle down!

01:12:35.478 --> 01:12:37.605
If it's all the same to you…

01:12:39.274 --> 01:12:41.192
… I'll drive that tanker.

01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:46.114
The offer is closed. Too late for deals.

01:12:46.823 --> 01:12:49.325
No deals. I wanna drive that truck.

01:12:50.451 --> 01:12:53.288
Why? Why the big change of heart?

01:12:53.454 --> 01:12:55.290
Believe me, I haven't got a choice.

01:12:55.456 --> 01:12:57.584
And how do you think you'll do it?

01:12:57.750 --> 01:13:01.129
I mean, look at you.
You couldn't even drive a wheelchair.

01:13:02.630 --> 01:13:05.717
You should look at yourself, Max.
You're a mess.

01:13:07.135 --> 01:13:09.012
Come on, cut the crap.

01:13:10.805 --> 01:13:13.141
I'm the best chance you've got.

01:13:21.482 --> 01:13:23.276
Right, let's get moving.

01:14:35.056 --> 01:14:37.266
Move that kid! Get rid of him!

01:15:53.634 --> 01:15:54.927
Oh, shit!

01:19:10.164 --> 01:19:14.252
Go! Go, go, go, go!

01:20:24.697 --> 01:20:26.699
I'm all right, I'm all right.

01:20:32.913 --> 01:20:34.749
Move it. Move it.

01:21:06.530 --> 01:21:08.949
Come on, come on, come on!

01:23:04.857 --> 01:23:07.902
The tire! Shoot the tire!

01:25:42.181 --> 01:25:44.642
Boy! Come on, jump!

01:25:45.684 --> 01:25:46.935
Come on, jump!

01:25:47.686 --> 01:25:48.687
I say.

01:25:49.563 --> 01:25:50.898
We've won.

01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.192
It's over, boy.

01:27:41.508 --> 01:27:42.634
Hey, kid.

01:27:43.552 --> 01:27:45.262
Get the bullet. The bullet.

01:27:45.679 --> 01:27:47.473
Get up. Go on.

01:27:51.643 --> 01:27:53.145
Get the shell.

01:27:54.813 --> 01:27:56.190
Get the shell.

01:27:56.356 --> 01:27:58.108
Come on. Come on, go!

01:31:30.070 --> 01:31:33.407
<i>And so began the journey
north to safety…</i>

01:31:34.074 --> 01:31:35.742
<i>… to our place In the sun.</i>

01:31:36.326 --> 01:31:40.330
<i>Among us we found a new leader,
the man who came from the sky…</i>

01:31:40.789 --> 01:31:42.457
<i>… the Gyro Captain.</i>

01:31:42.958 --> 01:31:45.252
<i>And just as Pappagallo had planned…</i>

01:31:45.419 --> 01:31:48.755
<i>… we traveled far beyond
the reach of men on machines.</i>

01:31:49.631 --> 01:31:53.593
<i>The juice, the precious juice,
was hidden in the vehicles.</i>

01:31:55.345 --> 01:31:57.556
<i>As for me, I grew to manhood…</i>

01:31:58.223 --> 01:32:01.143
<i>… in the fullness of time,
I became the leader…</i>

01:32:01.309 --> 01:32:03.937
<i>… the chief of the
Great Northern Tribe.</i>

01:32:05.856 --> 01:32:07.691
<i>And the Road Warrior?</i>

01:32:08.567 --> 01:32:11.194
<i>That was the last we
ever saw of him.</i>

01:32:12.112 --> 01:32:16.283
<i>He lives now only in my memories.</i>

01:32:17.305 --> 01:32:23.209
