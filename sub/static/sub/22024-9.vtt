He doesn't understand
how things work here...

33:24.130 --> 33:25.995
...how important it is to be
feared.

33:26.070 --> 33:28.664

NICK: Izzy, look...

33:58.600 --> 34:02.366
I can't even begin to understand
the pain that these people
caused you.

34:06.240 --> 34:09.277
But I think
this is the best thing to

34:09.340 --> 34:12.468
keep us all safe and
it's definitely best
for the company.

34:17.250 --> 34:19.138
There it is.
Four to one.

34:21.160 --> 34:23.253
WES: I'll let the people
at Axis know.

34:28.430 --> 34:30.352
(SIGHING)
Can I have a...

34:40.970 --> 34:42.835
Look,
I know you're...

34:42.910 --> 34:44.639
You're soft,
Nick.

34:47.250 --> 34:50.242
You're soft and you
so desperately want not to be.

34:51.850 --> 34:52.839
It's sad.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.551
I'm just trying
to help...

34:58.630 --> 35:00.382
That's why
your girl left you.

35:04.230 --> 35:05.595
That's why
your daddy left you.

35:07.730 --> 35:09.539
That's why Wes
will leave you, too.

35:11.440 --> 35:14.409
Only a matter of time
before he realizes
you ain't shit.

35:36.500 --> 35:38.968

35:39.030 --> 35:43.660

Axis people makes you Sick.

35:43.740 --> 35:45.037
I get it.

35:45.110 --> 35:46.304
But...

35:48.210 --> 35:49.734
I mean,
you're smarter
than that.

35:51.210 --> 35:53.474
This partnership
could change everything.

35:53.550 --> 35:56.872
We could just
live our lives, but...

35:58.350 --> 36:01.183
I think you're afraid
to let yourself be happy.

36:04.930 --> 36:06.921
And that's

36:06.990 --> 36:10.289
maybe the saddest thing
that I can think of. So...

a chance to bond.

37:12.430 --> 37:15.297

to do all that, bruh.

37:25.070 --> 37:26.469
I'm done here,
y'all.

37:28.640 --> 37:30.528

37:31.880 --> 37:33.768
We're just getting started.
RONNIE: Yes.

37:33.850 --> 37:37.217
And we called that truce
with Vera. So y'all
don't need me no more.

37:37.280 --> 37:38.713
Hey.

37:38.790 --> 37:41.042
This is your company, too.
It's about to be very different.

37:41.120 --> 37:43.782

You guys are
a legit company now.

it's gonna cost

38:04.010 --> 38:05.409
to get rid of me,

38:06.980 --> 38:08.777
and I'll see y'all later.

38:15.920 --> 38:16.909
I don't know.

38:19.860 --> 38:23.352
Look, I just... I know
you deserve better than
what you've got in here.

38:23.430 --> 38:26.558
I know that.
But you have to admit,

38:26.630 --> 38:28.666
it's a pretty unique
situation here for a minute.
