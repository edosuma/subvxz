34:41.187 --> 34:44.582
In the meantime, I was hoping
we could speak face to face.

34:44.625 --> 34:46.584
- [Child]:
Alex! Alex!

34:46.627 --> 34:48.760
- The phone's good enough.

34:48.803 --> 34:51.719
- Calum, listen, before I can
get you any money,

34:51.763 --> 34:54.461
I need to make sure those
hostages are OK.

34:55.593 --> 34:58.073
[Children talking in distance]

35:00.336 --> 35:02.861
- Come alone.
Left entrance.

35:05.254 --> 35:07.082
- All right.

35:28.800 --> 35:31.629
[Train horn blaring
in distance]

35:50.299 --> 35:51.997
[Door buzzing]

36:00.919 --> 36:03.095
- Calum?

36:03.138 --> 36:07.055
[Children talking in distance]

36:14.062 --> 36:16.238
What's this?

36:16.282 --> 36:18.632
- It's like an
electric fence.

36:18.676 --> 36:20.939
- So, if I touch it?

36:20.982 --> 36:23.376
- You don't wanna find out.

36:28.947 --> 36:32.385
- Did you make that gun
on your 3D printer?

36:32.428 --> 36:33.821
- Yeah.

36:37.259 --> 36:40.175
- Your mom told me
you're really smart.

36:40.219 --> 36:43.439
I'm beginning to think
she was being modest.

36:43.483 --> 36:45.311
- You got something for me?

36:45.354 --> 36:48.575
- I need to make sure
the kids are OK, Calum.

36:48.618 --> 36:49.794
- They're fine.

36:49.837 --> 36:51.447
- I need to see
for myself.

36:51.491 --> 36:54.059
- Well, you hear them, right?
- Yeah, I do.

36:54.102 --> 36:56.061
- Well, that's the best
you're gonna get,

36:56.104 --> 36:58.237
because you're not coming in.

36:58.280 --> 37:01.153
- You're keeping
them back there?

37:01.196 --> 37:05.070
- They'll be fine as long as
no one tries to open that door.

37:05.113 --> 37:07.072
- Do they know
what's going on?

37:07.115 --> 37:10.292
- They think this is
a part of their field trip,

37:10.336 --> 37:12.642
and I'm trying
to keep it that way.

37:12.686 --> 37:16.211
But don't think just 'cause I
don't wanna hurt them I won't.

37:16.255 --> 37:18.213
- One thing that'll
help me get your money

37:18.257 --> 37:20.215
is if can leave here
with a few hostages.

37:20.259 --> 37:24.524
- No.
- Letting some of them go won't
hurt your chances of getting it.

37:24.567 --> 37:27.570
- If I release any, the others
will wonder what's happening.

37:27.614 --> 37:29.964
- I appreciate your concern,
but my only goal is to

37:30.008 --> 37:32.010
get you and them out
of here in one piece.

37:32.053 --> 37:34.490
I've got a SWAT team that's
itching to come in here.

37:34.534 --> 37:36.188
I don't want that to happen.

37:36.231 --> 37:38.364
- So, you're looking out for me?

37:38.407 --> 37:39.887
- I am.

37:39.931 --> 37:42.803
I know it's hard
to believe, but I am.

37:42.847 --> 37:43.804
- You're right.

37:43.848 --> 37:45.501
I don't believe you.
- Calum...

37:45.545 --> 37:48.417
- I did my homework.
I know your tricks.

37:48.461 --> 37:50.768
- Tricks?
- You use my name
when you talk to me.

37:50.811 --> 37:52.987
You try to make it seem
like you're on my side.

37:53.031 --> 37:55.076
You say no without
actually using the word.

37:55.120 --> 37:58.123
It's ways to manipulate me,
and it won't work!
- OK, I got it!

37:58.166 --> 38:00.778
- In case you don't,
let me be clear.

38:00.821 --> 38:04.912
If you do not get my money
by the deadline, a kid dies.

38:04.956 --> 38:07.915
If you try to cut
my power, a kid dies!

38:09.351 --> 38:12.137
And if anyone tries
to come in here again,

38:12.180 --> 38:14.356
all of the kids die.

38:19.535 --> 38:21.842
[Breathing shallowly]

38:23.104 --> 38:25.628
- She's been in there a while.

38:25.672 --> 38:27.805
- How long before
we start to worry?

38:27.848 --> 38:29.981
- Oh, I'm way past that.

38:41.557 --> 38:43.821
[Door buzzing]

38:45.126 --> 38:46.388
- There!

38:57.530 --> 39:01.577
The whole place is rigged.
We can't get in even
if we wanted to.

39:01.621 --> 39:04.667
- Like you'd think
anything else!
- I'm serious! It's too risky.

39:04.711 --> 39:06.887
Especially since we don't
have eyes in there.

39:06.931 --> 39:09.324
- Let me worry about that.
- Hamilton.

39:09.368 --> 39:12.284
Now that you've had
a face-to-face with him,

39:12.327 --> 39:13.894
give me your honest assessment.

39:13.938 --> 39:15.765
Do you think you can
talk him down?

39:15.809 --> 39:18.464
- Yes.
- Yeah, of course
you're gonna say that.

39:18.507 --> 39:19.987
- Give it a rest, will you?

39:21.075 --> 39:22.337
Did you see the kids?

39:22.381 --> 39:24.513
- No, he has an
electric barricade

39:24.557 --> 39:25.645
set up at the entrance.

39:25.688 --> 39:27.299
He's too paranoid
to let me past.

39:27.342 --> 39:29.388
But I did hear them.

39:29.431 --> 39:31.172
I wanna get Julia
McGill down here.

39:31.216 --> 39:33.000
- Why?

39:33.044 --> 39:34.480
- I think she was lying

39:34.523 --> 39:37.222
about knowing the significance
of the ransom amount.

39:37.265 --> 39:39.050
- Then maybe she
can fill us in on why

39:39.093 --> 39:41.356
Calum wants the money
from American Imperial.

39:41.400 --> 39:43.968
- Exactly, and that
might be my way in.

39:44.011 --> 39:47.928
- While you do that,
I'm gonna find an actual way in.

39:47.972 --> 39:50.931
- What's up with
you two lately?

39:50.975 --> 39:52.280
- You know Hamilton.

39:52.324 --> 39:55.370
He's only happy when
he's shooting at something.

40:04.423 --> 40:06.991
[Siren wailing]

40:09.819 --> 40:13.040
- Have you seen Calum?
Nobody will tell me anything.

40:13.084 --> 40:14.433
- I just met with him.

40:14.476 --> 40:15.608
- Is he OK?

40:15.651 --> 40:18.089
- He's fine.
He's in a lot of trouble.

40:18.132 --> 40:20.091
- Can I talk to him?

40:20.134 --> 40:23.094
- Mrs. McGill, we find
in situations like this

40:23.137 --> 40:24.965
that speaking
with loved ones

40:25.009 --> 40:27.402
often agitates
the hostage-taker.

40:27.446 --> 40:31.537
- He's not a bad person.
He's just confused.

40:31.580 --> 40:33.104
- I know that.

40:33.147 --> 40:36.107
And I know that you
wanna protect him.

40:36.150 --> 40:40.328
But you're not helping him by
keeping information from me.

40:40.372 --> 40:42.852
I need to know why
he's doing this.

40:48.728 --> 40:51.470
- I'd been sick
for a while.

40:51.513 --> 40:54.560
The doctors couldn't
figure out why.

40:54.603 --> 40:57.737
One day, I started
coughing up blood

40:57.780 --> 40:59.826
and had to be rushed
to the hospital.

40:59.869 --> 41:01.610
They gave me a CT scan

41:01.654 --> 41:05.527
and they realized I had
a tumour in my intestine.

41:05.571 --> 41:07.094
- Cancerous?

41:07.138 --> 41:08.791
- Yes.

41:08.835 --> 41:10.271
It had gotten so big

41:10.315 --> 41:13.405
that it ruptured the veins
in my stomach lining.

41:13.448 --> 41:16.190
Without emergency surgery,
I would've died.

41:17.670 --> 41:20.368
- And what's your
prognosis now?

41:20.412 --> 41:22.240
- Not good.

41:22.283 --> 41:23.893
Pathology determined

41:23.937 --> 41:28.028
it was a gastro-intestinal
stromal tumour, GIST for short.

41:28.072 --> 41:30.813
It's an extremely
rare form of cancer

41:30.857 --> 41:33.555
that doesn't respond
to chemotherapy.

41:33.599 --> 41:35.122
- I'm sorry.

41:35.166 --> 41:39.648
- Targeted biologic
therapies can halt its growth

41:39.692 --> 41:42.260
and add years to
a patient's life,

41:42.303 --> 41:44.349
but I haven't
been able to try

41:44.392 --> 41:48.135
since the insurance company
won't cover my treatment.

41:48.179 --> 41:49.789
Not only that,

41:49.832 --> 41:53.575
but they rejected my claim
for the emergency surgery.

41:53.619 --> 41:55.882
- And this was issued
by American Imperial?

41:55.925 --> 41:58.015
- Yes.

41:59.277 --> 42:01.888
- And what reason
did they give?

42:01.931 --> 42:05.848
- They said because
my condition is so rare,

42:05.892 --> 42:07.981
that it's not covered
in the policy.

42:08.025 --> 42:11.158
And when the hospital
went ahead with the surgery

42:11.202 --> 42:13.769
and didn't request
a coverage exception,

42:13.813 --> 42:15.119
it voided my policy.

42:15.162 --> 42:16.424
We've lost everything!

42:16.468 --> 42:19.819
I had to sell our house,
drain our bank account.

42:19.862 --> 42:22.691
- So, the specific amount of
money Calum's asking for...

42:22.735 --> 42:26.478
- That's the exact amount
the insurance company rejected.

42:26.521 --> 42:29.394
- Mrs. McGill,
are you OK?

42:29.437 --> 42:31.091
- No, I'm just--

42:31.135 --> 42:32.788
- Call an ambulance!

42:35.574 --> 42:39.230
- [Chief]: Do they know what
caused her to black out?

42:39.273 --> 42:42.320
- It's most likely related
to her condition.

42:42.363 --> 42:44.452
- Yeah, the stress
of the situation

42:44.496 --> 42:45.671
can't be
helping either.

42:45.714 --> 42:47.716
- I have a copy of
her insurance policy.

42:47.760 --> 42:49.414
I'm trying to find something

42:49.457 --> 42:52.069
that'll help convince
the company to cooperate.

42:52.112 --> 42:54.332
- Well, unless it's
naked photos of the CEO,

42:54.375 --> 42:55.724
I wouldn't count on it.

42:56.812 --> 43:00.077
- Actually, this might help.

43:02.166 --> 43:04.777
- [Man]: We've got somebody
who's got the music...

43:04.820 --> 43:07.084
- Mrs. Marshall, could you
come with me, please?

43:07.127 --> 43:09.086
- Has something
happened to Everly?

43:09.129 --> 43:10.739
- No, I just wanna
talk to you.

43:10.783 --> 43:13.351
- [Man]: We're ready
to go live whenever.

43:13.394 --> 43:15.092
It could be 10 minutes
or 10 hours.

43:15.135 --> 43:17.659
- [Amber]: You work for
American Imperial Insurance?

43:17.703 --> 43:19.531
- [Trish]:
I'm a claims adjuster there.

43:19.574 --> 43:21.881
- And you oversaw a claim
for a Julia McGill?

43:21.924 --> 43:22.969
[Chuckling]

43:23.012 --> 43:24.840
- I deal with
a lot of claims.

43:24.884 --> 43:27.887
- She's suffering from
a rare form of cancer, GIST.

43:27.930 --> 43:31.282
She needed emergency surgery.

43:31.325 --> 43:34.633
- Ah! That's--that's right.
I remember now, yes.

43:34.676 --> 43:37.244
We had to deny it,
unfortunately. Why?

43:37.288 --> 43:40.552
- The young man in
the warehouse, that's her son.

43:40.595 --> 43:41.944
- Oh my God!

43:41.988 --> 43:43.816
So he specifically
took my daughter?

43:43.859 --> 43:45.122
- [Chief]:
We believe so.

43:45.165 --> 43:46.732
- And the other
kids in the bus?

43:46.775 --> 43:50.649
- They were most likely in the
wrong place at the wrong time.

43:50.692 --> 43:52.781
- Mrs. McGill's
condition is rare.

43:52.825 --> 43:54.522
I didn't want to
deny her coverage,

43:54.566 --> 43:55.871
but I was just
doing my job.

43:55.915 --> 43:57.873
- I'm sure you were,

43:57.917 --> 43:59.136
but her son insists

43:59.179 --> 44:01.486
that the ransom money
come from your company.

44:01.529 --> 44:03.052
- How much is
he asking for?

44:03.096 --> 44:05.142
- Almost 3/4 of
a million dollars.

44:05.185 --> 44:08.710
We hope that it might increase
our odds of getting the money

44:08.754 --> 44:11.931
if the request came directly
from one of its employees.

44:11.974 --> 44:14.194
- You want me to ask
for the money?

44:14.238 --> 44:15.369
- Will you?

44:15.413 --> 44:17.937
- Of course! Anything
I can do to help.

44:21.245 --> 44:24.161
The police hope they
can recover the money.

44:25.727 --> 44:29.688
Well, no, I realize there
are no guarantees, but--

44:31.777 --> 44:33.387
Yes.

44:33.431 --> 44:37.130
I realize we were within our
rights to deny the claim.

44:38.827 --> 44:41.090
I understand
there is a policy,

44:41.134 --> 44:44.572
but can you at least
reach out to head office?

44:46.618 --> 44:51.405
But--but these are
extenuating circumstances.

44:51.449 --> 44:53.799
He has my daughter!

44:53.842 --> 44:56.541
[Woman on police radio,
indistinct]

45:00.893 --> 45:02.851
All right.

45:07.726 --> 45:10.119
- They're not gonna
pay the ransom?

45:13.601 --> 45:15.560
- He says he...

45:15.603 --> 45:18.998
Our company's first obligation
is to the shareholders,

45:19.041 --> 45:23.611
and that we can't risk
the precedent this would set.

45:23.655 --> 45:25.570
- The precedent?

45:25.613 --> 45:26.962
- [Sighing]: Yeah.

45:27.006 --> 45:29.443
He's using the
slippery-slope argument.

45:29.487 --> 45:31.576
If we give in to
Calum's demands,

45:31.619 --> 45:35.667
how long before another rejected
policy holder takes a hostage?

45:35.710 --> 45:38.626
- Well, that just sounds
like an excuse to me.

45:38.670 --> 45:40.628
- It is.

45:41.890 --> 45:44.328
[Breathing shallowly]

45:47.983 --> 45:49.898
- When are you planning
on telling Calum

45:49.942 --> 45:51.291
he's not getting his ransom?

45:51.335 --> 45:53.293
- Not until the last
possible moment.

45:53.337 --> 45:55.339
- His deadline's in
just over 2 hours,

45:55.382 --> 45:56.688
so you have till then.

45:56.731 --> 45:58.820
After that, I gotta
send Hamilton in.

45:58.864 --> 46:01.214
- Excuse me, I think you're
gonna wanna see this.

46:01.258 --> 46:03.042
- Reporting from
outside the warehouse

46:03.085 --> 46:05.740
where 10 children from
Templeton Elementary

46:05.784 --> 46:07.307
are being held hostage.

46:07.351 --> 46:09.570
The Chief of Police has yet
to make a statement,

46:09.614 --> 46:12.617
so we don't know much about the hostage-taker or his demands.

46:12.660 --> 46:15.272
One thing we do know is
putting his daughter-in-law

46:15.315 --> 46:17.056
in charge of the
hostage negotiation

46:17.099 --> 46:19.363
has left a lot of
the parents wondering

46:19.406 --> 46:21.887
whether Chief Cross
has crossed the line.

46:21.930 --> 46:24.281
Sources within her
own department feel

46:24.324 --> 46:26.631
that Det. Cross may not
be up to the task

46:26.674 --> 46:29.590
after a failed negotiation
earlier this year

46:29.634 --> 46:31.549
ended with the tragic death

46:31.592 --> 46:34.247
of a Glastonbury woman

He's small for his age, smart.

58:29.396 --> 58:32.051
- What's his name?

58:32.095 --> 58:33.792
- Oliver.

58:33.835 --> 58:36.708
- Well, he needs to stand up
for himself, fight back.

58:36.751 --> 58:39.580
- I told him he should try
to reason with them.

58:39.624 --> 58:41.060
- Talk his way
out of it?

58:41.104 --> 58:42.975
- Well, that's
oversimplifying it, but--

58:43.019 --> 58:46.196
- No, when someone's picking
on you, words don't work.

58:46.239 --> 58:48.937
You need to make a stand.
- I think he did that today.

58:48.981 --> 58:51.984
I got a call from the school
saying he got into a fight.

58:52.028 --> 58:54.465
- Well, did he win?

58:54.508 --> 58:56.902
- I haven't had a chance
to speak with him.

58:56.945 --> 58:58.599
I've been a
little preoccupied.

58:58.643 --> 58:59.992
Calum, what happens

59:00.036 --> 59:03.517
if things don't turn out
the way you want today?

59:03.561 --> 59:06.216
- They will.

59:06.259 --> 59:07.782
- OK, say they do.

59:07.826 --> 59:10.307
You'll be on the run
for the rest of your life,

59:10.350 --> 59:12.483
and your mother,
she's pretty sick.

59:12.526 --> 59:14.441
You'll most likely
never see her again.

59:14.485 --> 59:17.314
- So I should just give up so
she can visit me in prison?

59:17.357 --> 59:19.098
- Nobody's been hurt yet.

59:19.142 --> 59:21.057
- It's not like they're
gonna let me go.

59:21.100 --> 59:23.842
- I'm not saying that
you won't get into trouble.

59:23.885 --> 59:26.018
But I could go to
bat for you in court.
- No!

59:26.062 --> 59:27.889
- Calum, I know why
you're doing this,

59:27.933 --> 59:30.022
how the insurance company
screwed you over.

59:30.066 --> 59:31.502
Your mother told us everything.

59:31.545 --> 59:33.286
And you have every
right to be upset.

59:33.330 --> 59:35.288
People will
sympathize with you.

59:35.332 --> 59:38.291
- My mom worked for 20 years
to pay off our house.

59:38.335 --> 59:40.902
She would work extra
on nights and weekends.

59:40.946 --> 59:42.339
She never called in sick.

59:42.382 --> 59:45.298
And in all that time,
she paid into her insurance.

59:45.342 --> 59:47.039
- Yes, and you should
be upset.

59:47.083 --> 59:49.041
But as a parent,
I can guarantee you

59:49.085 --> 59:51.913
your mother would rather
have you in her life

59:51.957 --> 59:54.177
than all of the money
in the world.

59:54.220 --> 59:55.526
- Back up.

1:00:01.140 --> 1:00:03.751
I gotta get the food
to the kids.

1:00:03.795 --> 1:00:06.885
- Calum, think about
what I said, OK?

1:00:21.639 --> 1:00:24.511
- I gave you a direct order

1:00:24.555 --> 1:00:26.774
to leave the food
and get out.

1:00:26.818 --> 1:00:28.428
- I'm sorry.

1:00:28.472 --> 1:00:29.560
- No, you're not.

1:00:29.603 --> 1:00:31.257
- You're right, I'm not.

1:00:31.301 --> 1:00:34.434
I said I would do whatever
I could to save those kids,

1:00:34.478 --> 1:00:36.871
and that's exactly what
I'm trying to do.

1:00:36.915 --> 1:00:39.657
- All right, then the
next time you disobey me,

1:00:39.700 --> 1:00:42.138
you will not only be
relieved of your duties,

1:00:42.181 --> 1:00:43.748
you will be
suspended as well.

1:00:43.791 --> 1:00:45.315
Is that understood,
detective?

1:00:45.358 --> 1:00:46.881
- Yes, sir.

1:00:48.492 --> 1:00:50.363
- Thank you.

1:00:51.973 --> 1:00:53.801
Did you make any progress?

1:00:53.845 --> 1:00:56.239
- I earned some
of his trust back.
- So that's a no.

1:00:56.282 --> 1:00:57.892
- You forced me
to backtrack--

1:00:57.936 --> 1:01:00.373
- We've exhausted our options
for talking him down.

1:01:00.417 --> 1:01:02.680
We need to take him out.
- We still have time.

1:01:02.723 --> 1:01:06.945
- We can't make the same mistake
of waiting because of your ego.
- You wanna compare egos?

1:01:06.988 --> 1:01:08.381
- A hostage died because

1:01:08.425 --> 1:01:10.862
you wouldn't admit you
couldn't talk your way out.

1:01:10.905 --> 1:01:14.474
- Hamilton.
- That situation went off the
rails for a number of reasons.

1:01:14.518 --> 1:01:16.520
It was not my fault!
- You're unbelievable!

1:01:16.563 --> 1:01:19.131
You're physically unable
to admit you're wrong.

1:01:19.175 --> 1:01:21.307
- I sure was wrong about you.
- That's enough!

1:01:21.351 --> 1:01:25.006
If you two can't put your
personal feelings aside,

1:01:25.050 --> 1:01:26.878
I will replace you both.

1:01:26.921 --> 1:01:28.488
Do I make
myself clear?

1:01:28.532 --> 1:01:29.707
- Crystal.

1:01:29.750 --> 1:01:31.012
- Thank you.

1:01:31.056 --> 1:01:35.016
Amber, I want this
to end peacefully too.

1:01:35.060 --> 1:01:39.282
But we need to prepare for the
possibility that it might not.

1:01:39.325 --> 1:01:42.676
So, Hamilton, I want you to put
together a plan for a breach

1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:43.851
and report back to me.

1:01:43.895 --> 1:01:44.983
- Yes, sir.

1:01:47.725 --> 1:01:48.943
[Door closing]

1:01:48.987 --> 1:01:51.685
- This is a mistake.
Calum is ready for them.

1:01:51.729 --> 1:01:54.775
If we go in with force,
it is gonna turn ugly.

1:01:54.819 --> 1:01:57.343
- Yeah, well, if you can't
convince him to give up,

1:01:57.387 --> 1:01:58.518
I don't have a choice!

1:01:58.562 --> 1:01:59.998
[Sighing]

1:02:00.041 --> 1:02:02.218
- I can't, but
someone else can.

1:02:03.436 --> 1:02:05.264
Are you feeling better?

1:02:05.308 --> 1:02:07.440
- Yes, thank you.

1:02:07.484 --> 1:02:09.399
- I know how stressful
this can be.

1:02:09.442 --> 1:02:10.835
- I was just dehydrated.

1:02:10.878 --> 1:02:13.620
- OK. I wanna make sure
that you're OK to do this.

1:02:13.664 --> 1:02:16.362
- I thought you were
worried me speaking to Calum

1:02:16.406 --> 1:02:17.798
might just upset him more.

1:02:17.842 --> 1:02:21.628
- I am, but we're running
out of options.

1:02:21.672 --> 1:02:23.630
- What do you
want me to say?

1:02:23.674 --> 1:02:25.066
- I want you to say

1:02:25.110 --> 1:02:29.288
whatever you think might help
him turn himself in.

1:02:29.332 --> 1:02:32.987
- OK, I'll do what I can.

1:02:38.689 --> 1:02:40.299
[Cell phone beeping]

1:02:42.867 --> 1:02:45.739
[Cell phone ringing]

1:02:47.001 --> 1:02:49.090
- Yeah.

1:02:49.134 --> 1:02:50.222
- Calum?

1:02:50.266 --> 1:02:51.832
- Mom?

1:02:53.399 --> 1:02:55.183
Are you OK?

1:02:55.227 --> 1:02:56.315
- Yes.

1:02:56.359 --> 1:02:57.925
I heard you fainted.

1:02:57.969 --> 1:03:00.798
- I just stumbled a little bit,
but I'm fine.

1:03:00.841 --> 1:03:02.930
- Are you sure that's all?

1:03:02.974 --> 1:03:05.193
- I just hadn't eaten anything

1:03:05.237 --> 1:03:08.588
since I found about--
about what you're doing.

1:03:08.632 --> 1:03:10.547
- Mom, you have to eat.

1:03:10.590 --> 1:03:12.810
- Don't worry about me.

1:03:12.853 --> 1:03:15.900
- Mom, I'm worried about you.
That's why I'm doing this!

1:03:15.943 --> 1:03:17.336
- I know, honey.

1:03:17.380 --> 1:03:19.643
And there's something
I need to say to you.

1:03:19.686 --> 1:03:22.950
I'm proud of you. You're taking
a stand for what's right.

1:03:22.994 --> 1:03:25.170
Don't give up,
no matter what they promise you.

1:03:25.213 --> 1:03:27.868
Don't give up until
you get the money!

1:03:27.912 --> 1:03:29.870
See it through to the end!

1:03:29.914 --> 1:03:32.090
- Mom! Mom!

1:03:32.133 --> 1:03:35.049
- Congratulations! You may have
just killed your son.

1:03:35.093 --> 1:03:37.791
- If he dies, he'll do so
knowing I'm proud of him.

1:03:37.835 --> 1:03:40.316
- Get her out of here.
Take her home.

1:03:40.359 --> 1:03:43.493
Make sure somebody
stays with her.

1:03:43.536 --> 1:03:45.582
- [Hamilton]:
Well, that didn't go to plan.

1:03:45.625 --> 1:03:47.801
- If you came to gloat,
you can just save it.

1:03:47.845 --> 1:03:50.064
- Actually, I think
I have a way

1:03:50.108 --> 1:03:52.676
of finishing this
without having to go in.

1:03:52.719 --> 1:03:54.591
- Yes.

1:03:54.634 --> 1:03:57.376
Yes, I realize we talked
about this already,

1:03:57.420 --> 1:04:01.380
but I really think you should
reconsider financing the ransom.

1:04:01.424 --> 1:04:04.122
Legal can say
whatever they like, I--

1:04:06.559 --> 1:04:08.387
Short-sighted?

1:04:08.431 --> 1:04:10.389
My daughter is in there.

1:04:10.433 --> 1:04:12.260
If you want to talk
short-sighted,

1:04:12.304 --> 1:04:15.438
we should talk about your policy
of denying fringe claims

1:04:15.481 --> 1:04:17.614
so that you can hit
quarterly targets.

1:04:20.660 --> 1:04:24.403
The only thing I'm threatening
to do is tell the truth.

1:04:24.447 --> 1:04:26.231
[Cell phone beeping]

1:04:26.274 --> 1:04:28.015
[Sighing]

1:04:33.673 --> 1:04:35.458
- See over there?
Those windows?

1:04:35.501 --> 1:04:37.764
- The ones covered in graffiti?
- Yeah.

1:04:37.808 --> 1:04:39.766
We've identified
some light changes

1:04:39.810 --> 1:04:41.681
in the shadows
through the paint.

1:04:41.725 --> 1:04:43.770
- How do you know
it's not the kids?

1:04:43.814 --> 1:04:46.164
- You told us he has
the hostages locked up,

1:04:46.207 --> 1:04:48.906
that he doesn't want them
to know what's going on.

1:04:48.949 --> 1:04:51.996
- So, your plan is to wait for
a shadow and take a blind shot?

1:04:52.039 --> 1:04:54.041
- Yes, sir.
That's correct.

1:04:54.085 --> 1:04:57.567
- Can you even tell how fast
he's moving, which direction?

1:04:57.610 --> 1:04:59.960
- No, so we need the green light
to take the shot.

1:05:00.004 --> 1:05:03.137
For this to work,
we have to act immediately.
- What if you miss?

1:05:03.181 --> 1:05:05.488
- You can't talk him down
or get the money.

1:05:05.531 --> 1:05:07.490
I'm not sure why
your opinion matters.

1:05:07.533 --> 1:05:08.621
- All right!

1:05:08.665 --> 1:05:12.408
If you have a clear shot,
take it.

1:05:12.451 --> 1:05:13.670
- Yes, sir.

1:05:15.541 --> 1:05:17.064
[Sighing]

1:05:21.591 --> 1:05:23.331
- What is she doing?

1:05:25.638 --> 1:05:26.857
- Hey!

1:05:26.900 --> 1:05:28.119
[Pounding on door]

1:05:28.162 --> 1:05:30.382
I'm sorry!

1:05:30.426 --> 1:05:32.602
I didn't want to turn down
your mother's claim.

1:05:32.645 --> 1:05:34.952
But if I don't follow the rules,
I lose my job,

1:05:34.995 --> 1:05:37.084
and they'd just replace me
with someone else

1:05:37.128 --> 1:05:38.521
who will do what they're told!

1:05:38.564 --> 1:05:41.306
Please don't hurt my
little girl because of me!

1:05:41.349 --> 1:05:43.830
Please!
These kids are innocent!

1:05:43.874 --> 1:05:46.877
Let them go and
take me hostage instead!

1:05:46.920 --> 1:05:48.574
Please!

1:05:55.320 --> 1:05:58.149
- I'd hoped that if he could see
the hurt he was causing,

1:05:58.192 --> 1:06:00.020
then he would have
a change of heart.

1:06:00.064 --> 1:06:01.500
- I understand,
Mrs. Marshall,

1:06:01.544 --> 1:06:03.894
but you could've jeopardized
this entire operation.

1:06:03.937 --> 1:06:06.462
- Well, I had to try.
I'm the reason they're there.

1:06:06.505 --> 1:06:08.464
- Hey! Hey, it's
not your fault.

1:06:08.507 --> 1:06:09.987
You were doing your job.

1:06:11.684 --> 1:06:14.600
- Can I talk to you alone?

1:06:17.951 --> 1:06:20.040
- I'll be outside.

1:06:26.743 --> 1:06:28.788
- What is it?

1:06:30.964 --> 1:06:33.967
- Their claim
should've been paid.

1:06:34.011 --> 1:06:36.753
- Then why did you reject it?

1:06:36.796 --> 1:06:38.494
- I was told to.

1:06:38.537 --> 1:06:41.540
I mean, not about
this case, but...

1:06:41.584 --> 1:06:43.368
There's been
pressure on adjusters

1:06:43.411 --> 1:06:45.675
to deny grey-area claims
whenever possible

1:06:45.718 --> 1:06:47.285
to decrease
our payout rate.

1:06:49.200 --> 1:06:52.420
- So, the call
you just made...

1:06:52.464 --> 1:06:54.422
- I thought they'd
do the right thing.

1:06:54.466 --> 1:06:55.815
I mean, we're the reason

1:06:55.859 --> 1:06:59.819
the CEO got his multi-million-
dollar bonus last year.

1:06:59.863 --> 1:07:01.647
[Sighing]

1:07:01.691 --> 1:07:03.431
- OK.

1:07:04.824 --> 1:07:08.349
What specifically
were you asked to do?

1:07:10.700 --> 1:07:13.137
- If a claim was big enough

1:07:13.180 --> 1:07:16.532
and fell into
the grey-area and...

1:07:18.795 --> 1:07:21.319
- And?

1:07:23.190 --> 1:07:25.758
- When the claimant
had a low probability

1:07:25.802 --> 1:07:28.195
of being able to
fight the decision...

1:07:29.936 --> 1:07:31.590
- Right.

1:07:31.634 --> 1:07:34.811
Because poor, sick people
can't put up a fight.

1:07:34.854 --> 1:07:38.249
- It was the only thing
I could do to keep my job.

1:07:38.292 --> 1:07:40.599
- OK.

1:07:40.643 --> 1:07:42.558
Do you have proof?

1:07:43.863 --> 1:07:45.648
- I can get it.

1:07:45.691 --> 1:07:47.650
- [Chief]:
Absolutely not!

1:07:47.693 --> 1:07:49.739
- I can do it,
but I need to in person.

1:07:49.782 --> 1:07:51.654
- Going in there to
get him to surrender

1:07:51.697 --> 1:07:53.351
so he can sue the
insurance company

1:07:53.394 --> 1:07:55.222
is not worth the risk.

1:07:55.266 --> 1:07:57.094
- It's a long shot,
but Trish is willing

1:07:57.137 --> 1:07:58.443
to testify on his behalf.

1:07:58.486 --> 1:08:00.706
