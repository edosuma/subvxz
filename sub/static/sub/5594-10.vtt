Diane's right.
Her system's airtight.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.757
So how did they gain access
to her computer?

09:18.759 --> 09:20.492
Well, the trojan
that delivered the rootkit

09:20.494 --> 09:22.193
Was installed directly
into her home server,

09:22.195 --> 09:23.328
Probably via thumb drive.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.729
So the hack came from inside
the house.

I know this is difficult,
but, diane, he is a programmer.

09:50.524 --> 09:52.057
No one else
was in that house?

09:52.059 --> 09:53.525
There's no sign
of forcible entry,

09:53.527 --> 09:55.093
And her alarm

09:55.095 --> 09:56.761

a new piece of code,

Billy calls it
"getting in the zone."

He drops off the grid all

another explanation.

billy to be a suspect.

If she accuses him
and she's wrong,

10:35.335 --> 10:36.835
She ruins her relationship.

If she accuses him and she's
right, she ruins her career.
