01:58.202 --> 02:00.412
The dream is always the same.

02:01.371 --> 02:04.374
<i>Instead of going home,</i>
<i>I go to the neighbors'.</i>

02:14.385 --> 02:16.221
<i>I ring, but nobody answers.</i>

02:17.472 --> 02:19.683
<i>The door is open, so I go inside.</i>

02:22.978 --> 02:25.689
<i>I look around,</i>
<i>but no one seems to be there.</i>

02:34.824 --> 02:37.035
<i>Then I hear the shower running.</i>

02:37.827 --> 02:40.413
<i>So, I go upstairs to see what's what.</i>

03:01.603 --> 03:02.938
<i>Then I see her.</i>

03:04.523 --> 03:05.941
<i>This... girl!</i>

03:06.233 --> 03:07.860
<i>This incredible girl!</i>

03:09.862 --> 03:13.407
<i>I don't know why she's there</i>
<i>because she doesn't live there...</i>

03:14.033 --> 03:16.369
<i>... but it's a dream, so I go with it.</i>

03:18.246 --> 03:19.956
<i>"Who's there?" she says.</i>

03:20.790 --> 03:22.083
<i>"Joel," I say.</i>

03:22.959 --> 03:24.711
<i>"What are you doing here?"</i>

03:24.794 --> 03:26.129
<i>"I don't know.</i>

03:27.005 --> 03:28.757
<i>"What are you doing here?"</i>

03:29.800 --> 03:31.844
<i>"I'm taking a shower," she says.</i>

03:33.053 --> 03:34.722
<i>Then I give her...</i>

03:35.264 --> 03:37.057
<i>..."Do you want me to go?"</i>

03:38.309 --> 03:39.685
<i>"No," she says.</i>

03:39.768 --> 03:41.730
<i>"I want you to wash my back."</i>

03:44.649 --> 03:47.235
<i>I'm getting enthusiastic about this dream.</i>

03:49.571 --> 03:53.158
<i>So, I go to her, but she's hard</i>
<i>to find through all the steam.</i>

03:53.742 --> 03:55.411
<i>I keep losing her.</i>

04:07.298 --> 04:09.259
<i>Finally, I get to the door...</i>

04:13.430 --> 04:17.851
<i>... and I find myself in a room full</i>
<i>of kids taking their College Boards.</i>

04:19.810 --> 04:21.813
<i>I'm over three hours late!</i>

04:22.023 --> 04:24.943
<i>I've got two minutes</i>
<i>to take the whole test.</i>

04:28.863 --> 04:31.032
<i>I've just made a terrible mistake.</i>

04:32.367 --> 04:34.410
<i>I'll never get to college.</i>

04:34.661 --> 04:36.121
<i>My life is ruined.</i>

04:40.125 --> 04:44.129
Here's the game: Five-card draw
with a spit. Anaconda, high-low.

04:46.048 --> 04:48.634
Pass two to the right, one to the left...

04:53.056 --> 04:54.349
What happened?

04:56.476 --> 04:57.602
Last night?

04:57.978 --> 04:59.771
That's right, with Kessler.

05:01.857 --> 05:03.651
She was babysitting down the street.

05:03.734 --> 05:04.986
We know that!

05:05.486 --> 05:07.071
So, I went over there.

05:09.156 --> 05:12.493
She was giving the kid a bath
and accidentally hit the shower thing.

05:12.577 --> 05:15.079
All of her clothes were drying upstairs.

05:18.750 --> 05:21.336
So, she plops down on the kitchen floor...

05:23.672 --> 05:25.841
...she looks up at me and says...

05:26.550 --> 05:28.510
..."I think I'm in the mood."

05:28.802 --> 05:30.095
She said that?

05:31.931 --> 05:33.308
What did you say?

05:34.767 --> 05:36.686
I didn't have to say anything.

05:36.769 --> 05:38.104
What did you do?

05:39.522 --> 05:41.232
What do you think I did?

05:41.774 --> 05:45.404
I think you got the hell out of there,
ran home and whacked off!

05:49.033 --> 05:50.409
I disagree.

05:51.619 --> 05:53.621
Did you have your bike there?

05:55.289 --> 05:58.835
I think you jumped on your bike,
pedaled home and whacked off!

06:01.796 --> 06:03.798
That's what you think, right?

06:04.216 --> 06:07.761
With Kessler sitting on the floor like that,
wanting me?

06:14.310 --> 06:15.686
No guts, Goodson.

06:16.062 --> 06:18.898
The problem was I just wasn't attracted
to her.

06:18.981 --> 06:20.358
That should never stop you.

06:20.441 --> 06:21.859
She seemed too big.

06:21.943 --> 06:23.653
It could've worked out.

06:24.153 --> 06:25.989
I thought I'd get into trouble.

06:26.073 --> 06:29.743
Sometimes you have to say,
"What the fuck!" Make your move!

06:31.995 --> 06:33.830
That's easy for you to say.

06:35.457 --> 06:38.335
You're all set.
You're probably going to Harvard.

06:39.462 --> 06:43.049
Me, I don't want to make a mistake,
jeopardize my future!

06:45.343 --> 06:47.387
Joel, let me tell you something.

06:50.348 --> 06:53.185
Every now and then, say, "What the fuck."

06:55.271 --> 06:57.439
"What the fuck," gives you freedom.

06:58.607 --> 07:00.609
Freedom brings opportunity.

07:01.777 --> 07:03.988
Opportunity makes your future.

07:07.659 --> 07:09.160
Be right there.

07:15.292 --> 07:17.627
So, your folks are going out of town?

07:19.629 --> 07:20.673
Tomorrow.

07:22.133 --> 07:24.427
You've got the place all to yourself?

07:27.221 --> 07:28.139
Yeah?

07:29.140 --> 07:30.516
"What the fuck."

07:36.565 --> 07:38.442
If you can't say it...

07:38.692 --> 07:40.194
...you can't do it.

07:50.413 --> 07:52.832
Joel, did you get your SAT scores?

07:56.044 --> 07:57.337
How did you do?

07:58.171 --> 07:59.964
597: Math, 560: Verbal.

08:02.593 --> 08:05.095
If you wanted to,
you could take them again?

08:05.179 --> 08:06.639
- I guess so.
- Great.

08:06.847 --> 08:09.016
Joel, I want to show you something.

08:09.767 --> 08:11.268
Honey, did you pack my Mace?

08:11.352 --> 08:13.145
Yes, in your cosmetic case.

08:18.568 --> 08:20.904
Joel, do you hear something odd?

08:21.112 --> 08:22.656
Something unpleasant?

08:22.781 --> 08:23.615
No.

08:24.574 --> 08:26.868
A preponderance of bass, perhaps?

08:28.579 --> 08:29.413
No.

08:29.872 --> 08:32.207
Is this the way I left the equalizer?

08:32.667 --> 08:33.501
No.

08:34.919 --> 08:37.547
This is not a toy for you and your friends.

08:39.881 --> 08:43.220
If you can't use it properly,
you're not to use it at all.

08:45.973 --> 08:47.641
My house, my rules.

08:52.896 --> 08:55.065
<i>Joel, I spoke to Bill Rutherford.</i>

08:55.399 --> 08:57.235
He interviews for Princeton.

08:57.318 --> 08:58.903
I'll never get into Princeton!

08:58.987 --> 09:00.905
I already arranged an interview.

09:00.989 --> 09:03.324
Friday night, the 4th, at our house.

09:03.658 --> 09:04.993
Jesus, Dad!

09:05.910 --> 09:09.163
Tell him about your involvement
with Future Enterprisers.

09:09.247 --> 09:10.749
They like that.

09:13.419 --> 09:15.838
There's $50 for food,
which is more than enough...

09:15.921 --> 09:19.174
...another $50 for emergencies
and an extra $25 just in case.

09:19.258 --> 09:22.261
Don't forget to water the plants
on the patio.

09:22.636 --> 09:24.848
I made a list, it's on the refrigerator door.

09:24.931 --> 09:26.558
Dad, should I start your car?

09:26.641 --> 09:27.851
The car will be fine, Joel.

09:27.934 --> 09:29.102
For the battery, I mean.

09:29.185 --> 09:32.063
Please, you're not to use my car.
You're not insured for it.

09:32.147 --> 09:34.733
- Use the station wagon.
- Use my car, honey.

09:36.109 --> 09:38.029
Do we understand each other?

09:38.195 --> 09:39.113
Okay!

09:40.781 --> 09:44.285
As far as the house is concerned,
just use your best judgment.

09:44.368 --> 09:45.786
We trust you.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.413
Have a great time.

09:48.164 --> 09:49.165
Be good.

09:49.290 --> 09:51.001
We will, honey. You too.

10:44.849 --> 10:47.687
<i>"Just take those old records off the shelf</i>

10:48.729 --> 10:51.232
<i>"I sit and listen to them by myself</i>

10:52.733 --> 10:55.361
<i>"Today's music ain't got the same soul</i>

10:56.362 --> 10:58.906
<i>"I like that old time rock and roll!</i>

11:00.367 --> 11:02.703
<i>"Don't try to take me to a disco</i>

11:04.037 --> 11:06.874
<i>"You'll never even get me out on the floor</i>

11:08.041 --> 11:10.794
<i>"In ten minutes I'll be late for the door</i>

11:11.628 --> 11:14.173
<i>"I like that old time rock and roll!</i>

11:15.633 --> 11:18.386
<i>"Still like that old time rock and roll!</i>

11:19.804 --> 11:22.473
<i>"That kind of music just soothes the soul</i>

11:23.474 --> 11:25.935
<i>"I reminisce about the days of old</i>

11:27.396 --> 11:29.815
<i>"With that old time rock and roll!"</i>

11:53.298 --> 11:54.467
Guess what?

11:54.550 --> 11:56.260
Dalby got into Harvard.

11:57.678 --> 11:59.347
He must have aced his Boards.

11:59.430 --> 12:00.640
780: Verbal.

12:01.015 --> 12:02.350
765: Math!

12:02.683 --> 12:03.601
Shit!

12:03.684 --> 12:06.354
Do you know what a Harvard MBA makes,
first year?

12:06.437 --> 12:07.438
$40,000.

12:07.606 --> 12:11.235
My cousin went into dermatology.
First year, over $60,000!

12:11.610 --> 12:13.320
Just for squeezing zits?

12:14.112 --> 12:17.199
Why don't you try it, Barry?
You have the experience.

12:18.700 --> 12:20.369
Thank you, you're very kind.

12:20.452 --> 12:22.038
Listen, you guys.

12:22.455 --> 12:24.874
Doesn't anyone want
to accomplish anything?

12:24.958 --> 12:27.126
Or do we just want to make money?

12:27.877 --> 12:29.003
Make money.

12:29.462 --> 12:30.838
Just make money.

12:31.339 --> 12:32.840
Make a lot of money.

12:33.216 --> 12:34.759
What about you, Joel?

12:37.054 --> 12:39.014
Serve my fellow mankind.

12:45.479 --> 12:46.855
Profit motive.

12:48.900 --> 12:50.235
Competition.

12:51.736 --> 12:53.071
Free enterprise.

12:54.155 --> 12:57.409
Is there any company
that doesn't have a product in production?

12:57.492 --> 12:59.077
We're falling far behind.

12:59.160 --> 13:00.579
You haven't exactly been helping.

13:00.662 --> 13:02.163
You wanted to be
the production executive.

13:02.247 --> 13:05.793
Bullshit! Every sales manager I know
helps with production.

13:05.918 --> 13:06.919
Yeah? Who?

13:07.003 --> 13:08.921
Everyone! Just help me
with the production!

13:09.005 --> 13:11.424
I can't! I'm too busy
with marketing and sales!

13:11.507 --> 13:13.301
How can you be busy
with marketing and sales?

13:13.384 --> 13:15.636
I haven't given you the product yet!

13:15.928 --> 13:18.348
Barry, just bring the goddamn thing
over tonight.

13:18.432 --> 13:21.977
I only did this because I thought
it'd look good on my record.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.903
Hi, Glenn. What's up?

13:30.111 --> 13:32.488
- I heard your parents were away.
- Yeah.

13:34.115 --> 13:36.492
I thought maybe I could borrow a room?

13:38.453 --> 13:40.538
Barry is here and we're working.

13:40.622 --> 13:42.290
We won't bother you.

13:42.624 --> 13:44.376
We don't have anywhere to go.

13:44.460 --> 13:45.920
You know how it is.

13:47.796 --> 13:49.423
Sure. Take my room.

13:50.925 --> 13:52.134
Thanks, Joel.

13:57.724 --> 13:58.892
Ready?

13:59.476 --> 14:00.894
The "Memo-Minder"!

14:02.062 --> 14:02.979
Here's how it works.

14:03.063 --> 14:07.317
A call comes in for your mom,
it's fairly important. What do you do?

14:07.484 --> 14:11.822
You write the message down here,
hit the switch... you've got the light.

14:13.074 --> 14:16.786
Now, a call for your dad comes in
and it's really important!

14:17.411 --> 14:19.997
You're gonna get your ass kicked in
if he misses it.

14:20.081 --> 14:21.332
So, what do you do?

14:21.415 --> 14:24.335
Write the message down there,
hit position two...

14:27.422 --> 14:30.801
$1.86 in parts, sell it for $9.95
and make a fortune!

14:38.268 --> 14:39.686
I can't concentrate with this.

14:39.769 --> 14:41.437
This is really annoying.

14:43.106 --> 14:44.566
It's ridiculous!

14:47.860 --> 14:49.237
I'm out of here.

14:56.954 --> 14:59.290
Lock the door when you leave, Glenn.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.878
If you read me, grunt twice!

15:09.301 --> 15:10.302
Thank you!

15:46.925 --> 15:49.594
I can't believe Glenn bringing
Statwiler over like that.

15:49.677 --> 15:50.511
Why?

15:50.678 --> 15:53.306
Because he boffed Hendricks last week!

15:53.681 --> 15:54.599
He did?

15:54.682 --> 15:57.727
Yes! And after the game on Saturday,
he fucked her.

15:58.770 --> 16:00.230
- Barry?
- What?

16:00.522 --> 16:02.900
Boffing and fucking are the same thing.

16:03.943 --> 16:05.027
They are?

16:07.029 --> 16:09.114
Yes. What did you think it was?

16:09.365 --> 16:11.450
I thought it was something else.

16:11.700 --> 16:13.202
You're sure on this?

16:14.537 --> 16:15.789
I'm positive.

16:19.251 --> 16:20.252
Shit!

16:31.055 --> 16:32.431
Sublime breasts.

16:33.057 --> 16:34.308
They're what kind of breasts?

16:34.392 --> 16:35.977
Sublime breasts!

16:39.981 --> 16:42.317
A couple of boys in daddy's car.

16:42.985 --> 16:44.486
Do you want to race?

16:50.993 --> 16:51.994
Hit it.

17:14.101 --> 17:15.269
Okay. Good.

17:16.103 --> 17:19.440
You've done the old man's car bit.
That's a good start.

17:21.942 --> 17:23.944
Now, try this on for size.

17:26.448 --> 17:27.949
"The Leather Castle.

Beginners welcome."

17:37.960 --> 17:39.670
It sounds great, Miles.

17:40.630 --> 17:41.964
Here's one!

17:42.048 --> 17:44.467

"Call Misty."

17:51.391 --> 17:54.478
Come on, Joel. You've got to
take advantage of this!

Succinct, to the point,

18:18.087 --> 18:20.589
If you want to call, call for yourself.

18:22.508 --> 18:24.009
A good time, Joel!

I'll make my own calls, thank you.

Then...

18:35.939 --> 18:36.940
...call!

18:37.274 --> 18:38.358
Forget it!

18:41.695 --> 18:42.946
Forget it!

18:43.530 --> 18:44.865
All right!

18:45.366 --> 18:46.534
I'm calling.

18:48.202 --> 18:49.537
You're calling?

18:50.538 --> 18:52.206
Someday you'll thank me for this.

18:52.290 --> 18:54.208
You'd better not mention me.

18:55.876 --> 18:57.878
It's her answering machine.

18:58.296 --> 19:01.425
Hi, Jackie, this is Joel Goodson,
345 Remson, Glencoe.

19:01.967 --> 19:04.928
I'd like a good time in my home tonight.
Bye!

19:10.726 --> 19:12.270
That was really cute.

19:13.396 --> 19:15.398
Now, give me the number
so I can call her back.

19:15.481 --> 19:17.567
Number? There's no number?

19:19.068 --> 19:20.987
Give me the number, damn it!

19:24.240 --> 19:25.743
There's no number.

19:27.411 --> 19:28.871
You're an asshole!

19:29.413 --> 19:31.498
Gotta go. Catch you later.

19:36.045 --> 19:37.296
Shithead!

20:45.202 --> 20:46.370
Oh, God!

21:03.306 --> 21:05.933
Hello, Joel. I'm Jackie. How are you?

21:09.061 --> 21:11.480
Nice to meet you, Jackie. I'm not Joel.

21:11.564 --> 21:13.608
Joel stepped out for a moment.

21:15.151 --> 21:16.528
I'll go call him.

21:24.328 --> 21:25.412
Holy shit!

21:29.334 --> 21:31.544
Dalby, get your ass over here!

21:32.003 --> 21:33.671
<i>I'm playing cards, Joel!</i>

21:33.922 --> 21:35.340
Just get over here!

21:35.423 --> 21:36.674
<i>Is she there?</i>

21:36.758 --> 21:39.427
Yes, she is here,
and she is waiting for you!

21:39.844 --> 21:42.681
She's not waiting for me,
she's waiting for you.

21:43.349 --> 21:44.642
Are you coming?

21:45.517 --> 21:47.186
<i>No! I'm playing cards!</i>

21:49.021 --> 21:50.481
You're not coming?

21:53.108 --> 21:54.652
<i>Get over here, Dalby!</i>

22:08.541 --> 22:11.254
Look, I'm sorry about
the misunderstanding.

22:13.130 --> 22:15.716
Joel, be a courageous person.
Open the door!

22:15.800 --> 22:18.135
That way, you see, I can call a cab.

22:19.220 --> 22:20.888
Again, I'm really sorry.

22:21.389 --> 22:25.227
As long as we come to an arrangement,
I'm in no mood for complaining.

22:25.310 --> 22:27.980
I mean, when you put
your good money down...

22:28.063 --> 22:31.316
...you gotta get what you wanted
in the first place. Know what I mean?

22:31.400 --> 22:34.569
When you buy a TV,
you don't buy Sony if you want RCA.

22:36.154 --> 22:38.658
I know we could get along
real well. But, hey!

22:38.741 --> 22:41.119
It's your hard-earned money, right?

22:41.911 --> 22:45.331
This way, we make an arrangement
and everyone is satisfied.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.000
You had carfare.

22:47.083 --> 22:50.044
A long ride. I don't ever come out this far.

22:51.255 --> 22:52.339
And your time.

22:52.423 --> 22:55.676
My time, my effort,
my infinite patience and understanding.

22:55.759 --> 22:56.760
Thank you.

22:56.844 --> 22:57.845
$75.

22:59.847 --> 23:00.848
Fair enough.

23:00.931 --> 23:03.434
Joel, I'm going to give you a number.

23:04.184 --> 23:05.812
You ask for Lana.

23:06.730 --> 23:08.732
- It's what you want.
- Thank you.

23:10.942 --> 23:13.570
It's what every white boy
off the lake wants.

23:45.479 --> 23:48.149
<i>All right, Goodson,</i>
<i>we know you're in there!</i>

23:48.733 --> 23:49.901
What's that?

23:51.069 --> 23:52.987
I think someone's out there.

23:59.745 --> 24:01.747
<i>Joel, the house is surrounded.</i>

24:02.998 --> 24:05.668
<i>Do exactly as we say,</i>
<i>and no one gets hurt.</i>

24:06.502 --> 24:07.503
Oh, shit!

24:07.586 --> 24:12.174
<i>Get off the babysitter! Put on your</i>
<i>pants, and come out with your hands up!</i>

24:19.432 --> 24:21.351
<i>Please, Joel, do as they say!</i>

24:23.061 --> 24:24.771
<i>Get off the babysitter!</i>

24:24.854 --> 24:27.191
<i>Don't throw your life away like this.</i>

24:29.527 --> 24:34.115
<i>Listen, you goddamn punk, you'll never</i>
<i>have a future! Not if I can help it!</i>

24:35.199 --> 24:37.201
<i>You got that? No future!</i>

24:38.035 --> 24:39.370
Who is that?

24:39.787 --> 24:40.872
My father!

25:37.934 --> 25:39.393
Hello? Lana?

25:40.770 --> 25:41.604
<i>Yes?</i>

25:43.189 --> 25:44.023
Hi.

25:57.287 --> 25:59.790
I'm a nice guy,
and I'd like to meet you tonight.

25:59.873 --> 26:01.458
<i>Fine. Where are you?</i>

26:04.545 --> 26:05.964
<i>Where do you live?</i>

26:10.051 --> 26:11.052
Glencoe.

26:12.136 --> 26:13.513
<i>What's your name?</i>

26:19.228 --> 26:20.187
Ralph.

26:21.313 --> 26:23.524
<i>Ralph, can I have the address?</i>

26:30.155 --> 26:31.116
345...

26:33.201 --> 26:34.327
...Remson.

26:35.662 --> 26:36.621
<i>Ralph?</i>

26:39.582 --> 26:41.126
<i>I'll see you tonight.</i>

28:21.734 --> 28:23.736
Are you ready for me, Ralph?

30:22.822 --> 30:26.034
This is a beautiful place, Ralph.
Is it all yours?

30:26.827 --> 30:28.537
It's my folks', actually.

30:29.496 --> 30:31.498
Do you know what it's worth?

30:33.709 --> 30:34.960
A lot, probably.

30:35.043 --> 30:36.713
Oh, yeah! Real estate?

30:37.046 --> 30:38.339
It's fabulous!

30:39.173 --> 30:41.884
Look, Lana... my name really isn't Ralph.

30:45.888 --> 30:47.223
It's Joel.

30:48.558 --> 30:50.310
I need $300... Joel.

30:53.522 --> 30:54.648
You're kidding?

30:54.732 --> 30:56.317
No, I don't believe I am.

30:56.400 --> 30:58.068
Can I send it to you?

31:01.071 --> 31:03.032
Can you send it to me, Joel?

31:03.574 --> 31:06.578
I just don't have that much here
in the house.

31:07.412 --> 31:09.247
How much do you have?

31:10.206 --> 31:11.833
- I have $50.
- $50?

31:13.168 --> 31:15.337
What are we going to do about this?

31:21.552 --> 31:23.179
I have a bond at the bank I could cash...

31:23.262 --> 31:25.431
I'm not good at waiting for people.

31:26.891 --> 31:28.142
I'll be quick.

31:28.601 --> 31:29.935
Give it a try.

32:09.812 --> 32:10.896
I'm back!

32:24.202 --> 32:25.578
I'm here for you.

32:46.310 --> 32:48.478
How could she? It's so stupid!

32:48.812 --> 32:50.230
Tell your mother it broke!

32:50.314 --> 32:53.025
That egg is worth a lot more than $300!

32:53.985 --> 32:55.695
What are you going to do?

32:56.321 --> 32:58.614
I'm gonna get it back,
is what I'm gonna do.

32:58.698 --> 32:59.449
Are you going to help?

32:59.532 --> 33:00.700
Sure. When?

33:02.493 --> 33:03.578
Right now!

33:03.828 --> 33:07.165
I can't do it right now!
I have a trig. Mid-term tomorrow!

33:07.708 --> 33:09.126
Hey, "Mr. What-The-Fuck"...

33:09.209 --> 33:11.629
...what about "exploring
the dark side" and all that?

33:11.712 --> 33:13.505
Or was that just bullshit?

33:14.006 --> 33:15.966
That was just bullshit, Joel.

33:17.718 --> 33:20.012
I'm surprised you listened to me.

33:25.727 --> 33:27.062
Are you coming?

33:35.863 --> 33:38.366
How can you even tell if she'll be here?

33:39.575 --> 33:42.328
I called Jackie and she said to try here.

33:43.871 --> 33:47.583
Great idea. Where else could
we get a hot chocolate for $4?

33:49.878 --> 33:51.004
She's here!

33:52.464 --> 33:53.632
Where?

33:54.716 --> 33:57.010
The blue dress... those legs...

33:58.762 --> 33:59.930
That's her.

34:00.055 --> 34:01.640
She's fantastic!

34:11.609 --> 34:13.360
She's looking right at us!

34:22.286 --> 34:23.831
She knows we're here.

34:34.092 --> 34:35.427
That's it?

34:36.386 --> 34:37.762
That's it, Joel?

34:40.931 --> 34:43.853
I can't believe we came
all the way here for that!

34:45.980 --> 34:48.065
At least she knows we're on to her, Miles.

34:48.149 --> 34:50.025
Yeah, she must be terrified.

34:50.109 --> 34:51.193
Joel!

34:54.989 --> 34:56.364
Is this your car?

34:57.326 --> 34:58.285
Maybe.

35:00.287 --> 35:01.997
Could we talk a minute?

35:02.456 --> 35:03.540
Okay.

35:04.416 --> 35:05.542
Let's talk!

35:05.959 --> 35:08.670
Okay. In the car, all right? It's freezing.

35:20.350 --> 35:22.060
Will you do me a favor?

35:23.186 --> 35:25.105
You want me to do you a favor?

35:25.189 --> 35:26.482
I just need a lift.

35:26.565 --> 35:28.317
Look, I want my egg back!

35:31.320 --> 35:32.488
Get out of the car!

35:32.571 --> 35:33.906
Joel, better get moving.

35:33.989 --> 35:35.407
I want my egg back!

35:35.491 --> 35:37.326
You got it, all right? Just start driving!

35:37.409 --> 35:38.286
When?

35:38.828 --> 35:40.330
- Now!
- Open the door!

35:41.081 --> 35:42.248
When do I get it back?

35:42.332 --> 35:43.541
Start driving!

35:43.625 --> 35:46.252
Open the door!
Are you going to open the door?

35:46.336 --> 35:47.504
Hey, buster!

35:47.962 --> 35:48.797
Fuck! Will you just...

35:48.880 --> 35:50.924
- Get off the car!
- Just start driving!

35:51.007 --> 35:52.468
Start driving, now!

35:54.011 --> 35:56.138
Why don't you start the car, Joel?

35:57.181 --> 35:58.599
Fuck! Get out of here!

35:58.683 --> 36:00.685
Start the goddamn car, Joel!

36:01.018 --> 36:02.520
Lana, open the door.

36:04.689 --> 36:06.483
Where are you going? Lana!

36:06.692 --> 36:08.485
Get out, or I'll kill you!

36:19.872 --> 36:21.290
Who was that guy?

36:21.541 --> 36:22.875
My manager.

36:23.501 --> 36:25.670
He gets a little crazy sometimes.

36:27.130 --> 36:28.881
This is my friend, Miles.

36:31.217 --> 36:33.220
Do you like excitement, Miles?

36:33.554 --> 36:34.555
Love it.

36:52.282 --> 36:54.284
Okay, where do you want to go?

36:55.076 --> 36:58.371
I don't know, Joel.
I haven't given it a lot of thought.

36:58.455 --> 36:59.706
Tell me this:

36:59.914 --> 37:02.043
Am I going in the right direction?

37:04.086 --> 37:05.796
Oh, shit! Here he comes!

37:06.172 --> 37:07.465
Here who comes?

37:08.090 --> 37:09.675
That manager guy?

37:13.764 --> 37:14.890
Hey, Guido!

37:15.307 --> 37:16.850
Big man, Guido!

37:17.934 --> 37:19.394
Big man with a gun!

37:19.603 --> 37:20.854
What are you going to do?

37:20.937 --> 37:22.522
Shoot us all? Stupid!

37:27.110 --> 37:28.738
This guy Guido...

37:29.280 --> 37:31.449
...he's a "manager"?
- That's right.

37:32.283 --> 37:33.409
Or a pimp?

37:33.618 --> 37:35.286
Now, that's quick, Joel.

37:35.703 --> 37:38.539
Have you always been this quick,
or is this something new?

37:38.623 --> 37:40.208
I don't believe this!

37:40.291 --> 37:41.919
I have a trig. Mid-term tomorrow...

37:42.002 --> 37:44.922
...and I'm being chased by Guido,
The Killer Pimp!

38:10.324 --> 38:11.283
Miles?

38:12.827 --> 38:13.869
I think I can take him.

38:13.953 --> 38:15.663
What are you talking...

38:45.903 --> 38:47.822
I'm really not enjoying this.

39:08.053 --> 39:10.055
I think I'm going to throw up.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.068
I think I'm going to throw up on you, Joel!

39:44.091 --> 39:45.426
Porsche...

39:45.635 --> 39:47.387
...there is no substitute.

39:50.348 --> 39:51.474
Fuck you.

39:56.062 --> 39:57.939
Hi, dear. It's Mother.

39:58.065 --> 39:59.358
How are you?

39:59.441 --> 40:01.902
Just checking in to say hello,
see how you're doing...

40:01.986 --> 40:04.363
...and give you our flight information.

40:06.156 --> 40:08.867
Wait a minute. Let me write this down.

40:10.285 --> 40:12.872
Saturday, United, Flight 162 at 3:30.

40:15.000 --> 40:18.920
That's right. How's everything else?
Do you have enough money?

40:19.963 --> 40:22.966
It never seems to go as far
as you think it will.

40:24.884 --> 40:26.303
Yes, I know.

40:26.846 --> 40:28.305
I'm learning, Mom.

40:30.349 --> 40:31.726
How is Aunt Tudi?

40:36.397 --> 40:37.606
I will.

40:38.858 --> 40:40.318
See you then, bye.

40:42.821 --> 40:44.156
Your folks?

40:45.490 --> 40:46.992
So, how are they?

40:47.326 --> 40:49.036
Oh, they're just great.

40:49.161 --> 40:50.662
How about Aunt Tudi?

40:50.829 --> 40:53.458
Her hip is much better.
She sends her love.

40:59.047 --> 41:01.090
You were telling me about Guido.

41:01.424 --> 41:02.675
I quit Guido.

41:05.345 --> 41:06.429
How come?

41:11.226 --> 41:12.978
He thought he owned me.

41:14.521 --> 41:15.814
Nobody owns me.

41:19.735 --> 41:23.198
The problem is, I owe him for clothes
and hospital bills.

41:23.448 --> 41:25.200
You were in the hospital?

41:26.701 --> 41:28.161
I had this...

41:29.079 --> 41:30.330
...pain in my chest.

41:30.413 --> 41:32.624
I thought it was a heart condition.

41:34.585 --> 41:35.753
What was it?

41:36.045 --> 41:37.755
The doctor said nerves.

41:38.214 --> 41:39.674
Nice service.

41:40.591 --> 41:41.884
Reed & Barton.

41:44.762 --> 41:47.264
Thank you for breakfast. It was good.

41:49.601 --> 41:51.311
I'm going to school now.

41:56.858 --> 41:58.819
I'll have to ask you to leave.

42:02.532 --> 42:03.658
I'm sorry.

42:04.784 --> 42:06.369
You won't let me stay?

42:07.620 --> 42:09.622
No, I have to go to school.

42:14.127 --> 42:15.754
I'm really sorry.

42:20.134 --> 42:21.385
No, I'm sorry.

42:27.016 --> 42:28.475
I'll be right back.

42:31.896 --> 42:33.815
You guys go ahead without me.

42:34.524 --> 42:35.817
She's still here?

42:35.900 --> 42:37.277
She won't leave.

42:40.905 --> 42:42.282
She won't leave.

42:47.747 --> 42:49.248
Lana, look...

42:50.333 --> 42:53.210
...I just want my egg back.
I want my house back.

42:54.337 --> 42:56.131
I have a lot of work to do.

42:58.425 --> 43:00.635
Did you have a good time last night?

43:04.181 --> 43:06.433
You mean when we got back here?

43:07.434 --> 43:09.353
I think you know what I mean.

43:15.860 --> 43:17.570
I had a great time.

43:20.948 --> 43:23.452
Don't tell me I owe you another $300.

43:25.579 --> 43:27.581
Did I say you owe me anything?

43:30.209 --> 43:30.876
No, you didn't.

43:30.959 --> 43:33.796
I don't remember saying
you owe me anything.

43:39.719 --> 43:41.721
What about my mother's egg?

43:42.472 --> 43:45.809
You're the one who's going to college,
you figure it out.

43:50.105 --> 43:51.816
How much time do you need?

43:51.899 --> 43:54.610
I need long enough
to make a few phone calls.

43:54.902 --> 43:57.571
I have to figure out how
to get my stuff back.

43:57.655 --> 44:00.950
Guido has probably locked me
out of the apartment by now.

44:01.325 --> 44:02.451
All right!

44:04.328 --> 44:06.164
But will you do me a favor?

44:06.665 --> 44:08.041
Anything, cookie.

44:10.127 --> 44:11.837
Don't steal anything!

44:14.631 --> 44:17.509
If I come back here,
and find anything missing...

44:18.678 --> 44:21.723
...I'm going straight to the police.
I'm not joking!

44:22.682 --> 44:25.184
Joel, go to school. Go learn something.

44:40.200 --> 44:42.119
May I see your pass, please!

44:43.954 --> 44:47.292
I'm sure you've all read
chapters six through eight...

44:47.709 --> 44:50.211
...so here's a little pop quiz to confirm it.

44:50.295 --> 44:52.964
Will you put your books on the floor,
please?

45:15.822 --> 45:17.115
You didn't tell anyone, did you?

45:17.199 --> 45:18.575
No. Glenn knows.

45:19.201 --> 45:20.327
What about Barry?

45:20.410 --> 45:21.703
He knows, too.

45:21.995 --> 45:23.622
Don't tell anyone!

45:24.081 --> 45:25.499
I won't! I won't!

45:35.259 --> 45:38.596
Lab reports should be on my desk
by tomorrow afternoon.

45:39.597 --> 45:41.892
I won't accept any that aren't typed.

45:57.283 --> 45:59.536
Term papers are due on Friday.

45:59.619 --> 46:02.288
They count for 50%
of this semester's grades.

46:04.541 --> 46:05.542
Damn it!

46:15.302 --> 46:16.470
Hey, Miles, what's going on?

46:16.554 --> 46:18.139
I'm waiting for Glenn.

46:18.389 --> 46:19.682
Glenn? Where is he?

46:19.765 --> 46:20.766
Inside.

46:21.560 --> 46:22.811
In the house?

46:22.894 --> 46:24.479
He wanted to meet her!

46:26.773 --> 46:27.816
What are you doing?

46:27.899 --> 46:28.900
I was inside.

46:28.984 --> 46:30.318
I can see that.

46:33.321 --> 46:34.906
You're home now.

46:35.324 --> 46:37.243
Yeah, I live here, remember?

46:40.079 --> 46:41.039
Glenn?

46:44.584 --> 46:46.836
Tell me you didn't do anything with her.

46:46.919 --> 46:48.004
Who, Lana?

46:48.588 --> 46:49.715
Yeah, Lana.

46:49.923 --> 46:50.966
Nothing.

46:51.050 --> 46:52.384
I met her.

46:52.718 --> 46:53.844
She's nice.

46:54.428 --> 46:56.597
You're sure you didn't do anything?

46:57.014 --> 46:58.349
Yeah, I swear.

46:58.807 --> 47:01.185
You did it with her, didn't you, Glenn?

47:01.518 --> 47:03.855
I did not do it with her, Joel!

47:10.945 --> 47:12.405
Ask me about Vicki!

47:13.990 --> 47:15.116
Who is Vicki?

47:15.200 --> 47:16.535
Owe you one!

47:20.539 --> 47:23.292
Are you Joel? Nice place you have here.

47:24.877 --> 47:26.045
Where's Lana?

47:26.128 --> 47:27.254
In the den.

47:27.338 --> 47:28.798
I like your friend!

47:30.467 --> 47:32.219
Get out! I'm not kidding!

47:32.636 --> 47:34.137
What's your problem?

47:36.348 --> 47:38.100
Just leave! Please!

47:38.892 --> 47:41.561
Look, we're not ripping you off or anything.

47:46.067 --> 47:47.318
What is this for?

47:47.402 --> 47:50.029
Fifty goes to the house! You're the house!

47:52.156 --> 47:53.908
I am not the house!

47:55.576 --> 47:57.413
Just leave! I mean it!

47:59.415 --> 48:00.791
He's mad, Vicki.

48:01.083 --> 48:02.918
Already? I just got here!

48:03.419 --> 48:05.170
I think he wants us to go.

48:05.587 --> 48:07.131
Do you want us to go?

48:10.884 --> 48:11.970
Thank you.

48:38.122 --> 48:39.875
<i>I don't want any problems.</i>

48:40.125 --> 48:42.044
<i>Do you know what</i>
<i>you did to me last night?</i>

48:42.127 --> 48:43.378
<i>I don't care!</i>

48:46.131 --> 48:48.633
<i>I don't want to see you</i>
<i>or do anything with you anymore.</i>

48:48.717 --> 48:50.010
<i>Get in the car!</i>

49:13.577 --> 49:14.661
Excuse me.

49:16.246 --> 49:17.831
What can I do for you?

49:18.457 --> 49:19.626
Who are you?

49:25.965 --> 49:28.218
Are you the kid I chased last night?

49:30.095 --> 49:32.472
Is there something I can help you with?

49:33.098 --> 49:35.017
You shouldn't drive like that.

49:35.101 --> 49:37.311
People get hurt all the time.

49:38.521 --> 49:40.314
Are you a smart kid?

49:41.315 --> 49:43.109
You look like a smart kid.

49:43.317 --> 49:44.610
I'm okay.

49:44.694 --> 49:46.612
Where are the girls? Inside?

49:49.199 --> 49:51.868
I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave.

49:56.790 --> 49:58.500
The door is locked.

49:59.501 --> 50:01.421
You're starting to give me a stomachache.

50:01.504 --> 50:03.214
Good! I hope it hurts!

50:04.382 --> 50:05.800
Are you going to open the door?

50:05.883 --> 50:08.428
Guido, go home!
We don't need you anymore!

50:08.553 --> 50:09.929
Shut your mouth!

50:10.555 --> 50:13.182
Listen, maybe we don't work
for you anymore!

50:15.018 --> 50:16.311
Then who do you work for?

50:16.395 --> 50:18.564
Who? If you don't work for me?

50:19.064 --> 50:20.983
Maybe we work for Joel, now.

50:22.901 --> 50:24.361
She's only kidding.

50:24.903 --> 50:26.030
I hope so.

50:28.241 --> 50:30.577
Joel, you look like a smart kid.

50:32.328 --> 50:35.707
I'm going to tell you something
I'm sure you'll understand.

50:36.666 --> 50:38.668
You're having fun now, right?

50:39.669 --> 50:41.922
Right, Joel? The time of your life.

50:43.841 --> 50:48.137
In a sluggish economy, never, ever fuck
with another man's livelihood!

50:50.264 --> 50:52.975
If you're smart, like I hope you are...

50:56.271 --> 50:58.982
...you aren't going to make me
come back here.

51:07.616 --> 51:08.993
Thank you, Joel.

51:12.288 --> 51:13.706
It's very decent of you.

51:13.790 --> 51:16.334
Just as long as we understand each other.

51:16.626 --> 51:19.629
One night, then you'll find another place
to stay.

51:19.962 --> 51:22.340
As soon as we get in touch with Tandy,
we'll have a place.

51:22.423 --> 51:24.927
- Did you try her again?
- She's still out.

51:25.386 --> 51:26.887
And my mother's egg?

51:27.471 --> 51:30.182
If I can get my stuff back, I can get the egg.

51:31.308 --> 51:32.643
Then you'll leave?

51:32.726 --> 51:34.103
Then we'll leave.

51:35.312 --> 51:38.274
I don't know, Lana.
He has such nice friends.

51:38.650 --> 51:40.318
Clean, polite, quick.

51:41.486 --> 51:43.446
I think there's a future here.

52:02.425 --> 52:04.010
What are you studying?

52:05.345 --> 52:07.013
It's a workshop...

52:07.764 --> 52:09.349
...on free enterprise.

52:15.647 --> 52:18.735
We make a product,
and then we try to market it.

52:21.779 --> 52:23.573
Do you make a lot of money?

52:24.532 --> 52:25.908
No. Not really.

52:29.662 --> 52:30.872
No, but we...

52:32.124 --> 52:34.626
...get to compete with other
student companies.

52:34.710 --> 52:36.336
Actually, it's fucked!

52:37.337 --> 52:39.006
I'm just kidding.

52:40.174 --> 52:42.176
It's really quite competitive.

52:46.473 --> 52:48.266
Do you ever get high, Joel?

52:50.226 --> 52:51.728
Yeah. All the time.

52:52.479 --> 52:55.565
You see, Vicki and I were thinking
about getting high.

52:56.733 --> 52:59.570
Maybe going out
and getting some ice cream?

53:02.239 --> 53:03.616
You want to come?

53:09.163 --> 53:11.665
I could go for some ice cream right now.

53:24.221 --> 53:25.514
Are you stoned?

53:25.932 --> 53:27.934
No. I do not believe so.

53:30.228 --> 53:32.188
I think you're really wasted!

53:33.106 --> 53:35.149
This is not wasted, Barry.

53:35.566 --> 53:37.527
This is definitely not wasted.

53:42.533 --> 53:43.492
Barry?

53:47.287 --> 53:49.498
- I'm a little wasted!
- I know.

53:52.876 --> 53:55.588
- Don't let me do anything stupid.
- Don't worry.

53:59.551 --> 54:01.052
Want to take a walk?

54:08.060 --> 54:10.062
How do you like living at home?

54:12.398 --> 54:13.733
It's okay.

54:14.066 --> 54:15.651
I'll be out next year.

54:15.901 --> 54:18.112
I'll bet your folks are nice.

54:18.612 --> 54:20.614
They're gone till Sunday?

54:21.074 --> 54:21.950
Yeah.

54:23.243 --> 54:25.203
Because, I was thinking...

54:25.662 --> 54:27.330
I mean, after your friend came over...

54:27.414 --> 54:29.124
...I couldn't believe it!

54:29.291 --> 54:31.460
A kid our age walks in with a $100!

54:32.753 --> 54:33.712
Glenn.

54:34.464 --> 54:36.758
Where did he get that kind of change?

54:37.091 --> 54:38.301
I don't know.

54:39.469 --> 54:41.471
He said he cashed a bond.

54:42.805 --> 54:44.807
You people have a lot of bonds.

54:48.479 --> 54:50.105
So, I was thinking...

54:51.982 --> 54:55.569
...if we ever got our friends together,
we'd make a fortune!

54:56.612 --> 54:58.113
Yeah. You're right.

54:59.782 --> 55:01.492
Do you want to do that?

55:01.826 --> 55:02.744
Do what?

55:02.827 --> 55:05.497
Get our friends together
in the next few days.

55:07.624 --> 55:09.501
No. I don't think so.

55:11.795 --> 55:14.631
Make some money. Be a little enterpriser.

55:15.131 --> 55:16.592
Future enterpriser.

55:18.344 --> 55:20.179
Be whatever you want to be.

55:26.310 --> 55:29.856
What if I said I'd be your girlfriend
for the next few nights?

55:30.816 --> 55:31.900
No charge?

55:34.486 --> 55:37.072
Hey, I'm not pushing you on the idea.

55:37.989 --> 55:40.659
It's just that my mind keeps working
all the time.

55:40.742 --> 55:44.247
Nothing I can do about it.
It keeps working and working.

55:57.761 --> 55:59.138
You warm enough?

55:59.346 --> 56:00.431
I'm okay.

56:06.895 --> 56:08.605
How come you left home?

56:10.692 --> 56:11.526
Why?

56:12.902 --> 56:14.446
I was just wondering.

56:18.199 --> 56:21.077
Because my step-father
kept coming on to me.

56:24.039 --> 56:26.041
What else do you want to know?

56:30.212 --> 56:32.548
Do you have any brothers and sisters?

56:34.050 --> 56:35.676
I have a brother.

56:36.218 --> 56:37.344
What else?

56:38.555 --> 56:40.140
If you don't want to talk...

56:40.223 --> 56:41.475
No, no. Ask me anything.

56:41.558 --> 56:43.810
I don't think you want to talk and it's okay.

56:43.894 --> 56:46.063
No, I really want to talk to you.

56:49.399 --> 56:50.734
What does he do?

56:51.736 --> 56:53.112
He's in school.

56:55.782 --> 56:57.784
How come you're not in school?

56:58.242 --> 56:59.702
I'm not my brother.

57:06.502 --> 57:09.004
I'm really trying to be friends with you.

57:09.088 --> 57:12.341
But I'd appreciate it if you'd
stop trying to judge me...

57:12.424 --> 57:15.427
...while you're leaning on your
daddy's $40,000 car.

57:19.641 --> 57:21.142
I'll see you around.

57:28.108 --> 57:29.776
Was it something I said?

57:36.492 --> 57:39.662
You locked the door!
The keys are inside the car!

57:40.496 --> 57:42.623
Please! Stop! Stop! Stop!

57:59.474 --> 58:01.477
Please stop! Please stop!

58:34.012 --> 58:35.346
Thank you.

58:35.555 --> 58:36.681
Thank you.

59:19.894 --> 59:22.147
All right, everyone watch your feet!

59:39.958 --> 59:41.209
Are you okay?

59:44.421 --> 59:46.131
Do you want an aspirin?

59:50.261 --> 59:51.929
Does your dad own a gun?

59:56.434 --> 59:58.227
Who's the U-boat commander?

01:00:12.784 --> 01:00:16.496
You're right. You are absolutely
right to respond this way.

01:00:17.623 --> 01:00:19.751
I did not have a doctor's appointment.

01:00:19.834 --> 01:00:22.420
But I will tell you exactly what happened.

01:00:22.962 --> 01:00:24.547
"Unexcused." You see, Nurse Bolan...

01:00:24.630 --> 01:00:27.633
...lf you write "unexcused,"
I fail two mid-terms.

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:30.303
It'll wreck my whole grade point average!

01:00:31.305 --> 01:00:35.100
If you'd just stop and listen to me,
I'll explain everything.

01:00:41.023 --> 01:00:44.486
The truth is, my parents are away,
and I met this girl.

01:00:46.488 --> 01:00:49.157
A call girl, actually.
She came to my house.

01:00:50.992 --> 01:00:52.744
Look, you're writing again!

01:00:52.827 --> 01:00:54.496
This is not "unexcused"!

01:00:55.830 --> 01:00:59.627
If you will just listen to me,
then you'll understand, Nurse Bolan.

01:01:01.337 --> 01:01:03.255
Why? Why won't you listen to me?

01:01:03.339 --> 01:01:05.299
I had a doctor's appointment.

01:01:09.845 --> 01:01:10.930
Excuse me.

01:01:11.848 --> 01:01:14.726
It wasn't the girl, it was my father's car.

01:01:15.519 --> 01:01:17.437
I put my father's car into Lake Michigan...

01:01:17.521 --> 01:01:19.523
...and I had to get it fixed.

01:01:22.025 --> 01:01:23.610
Just give me a break.

01:01:28.533 --> 01:01:30.243
Let me put it this way.

01:01:30.535 --> 01:01:35.206
I have spent the last four years
of my life busting my butt in this shithole!

01:01:38.709 --> 01:01:39.795
I'm sorry.

01:01:40.045 --> 01:01:44.425
I don't think I can leave until I get
just a little compassion from you.

01:01:50.722 --> 01:01:52.015
What did he get?

01:01:52.099 --> 01:01:53.977
Suspension, five days.

01:01:55.103 --> 01:01:56.896
They kicked him out
of Future Enterprisers, too.

01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:59.149
Shit! They trashed his whole record!

01:01:59.232 --> 01:02:01.484
What's he going to do about the car?

01:02:05.238 --> 01:02:06.907
Are you okay, Joel?

01:02:08.743 --> 01:02:09.994
I'm okay.

01:02:20.630 --> 01:02:21.923
I need a bike.

01:02:22.507 --> 01:02:23.508
He needs a bike.

01:02:23.592 --> 01:02:26.178
- Glenn, can I borrow your bike?
- Jesus, Glenn!

01:02:26.261 --> 01:02:27.846
Sure. Here, use mine.

01:04:58.299 --> 01:05:00.635
<i>It was great the way her mind worked:</i>

01:05:00.802 --> 01:05:02.804
<i>No guilt, no doubts, no fear.</i>

01:05:03.721 --> 01:05:05.390
<i>None of my specialties.</i>

01:05:09.228 --> 01:05:12.898
<i>Just this shameless pursuit of immediate</i>
<i>material gratification.</i>

01:05:14.233 --> 01:05:15.651
<i>What a capitalist!</i>

01:05:19.072 --> 01:05:23.076
<i>She told me I could make more money</i>
<i>in one night than I'd make all year.</i>

01:05:23.159 --> 01:05:25.286
<i>Enough to pay for my father's car.</i>

01:05:25.745 --> 01:05:27.914
<i>She told me she'd be my girlfriend.</i>

01:05:31.167 --> 01:05:33.212
<i>She told me a lot of things.</i>

01:05:33.295 --> 01:05:34.797
<i>I believed them all.</i>

01:05:35.756 --> 01:05:38.050
<i>So, she introduced me to her friends.</i>

01:05:43.764 --> 01:05:45.600
<i>"Now when I was a young boy</i>

01:05:47.519 --> 01:05:49.020
<i>"At the age of five</i>

01:05:50.856 --> 01:05:53.024
<i>"My mother said I was going to be</i>

01:05:54.192 --> 01:05:55.902
<i>"The greatest man alive</i>

01:05:57.529 --> 01:05:59.115
<i>"But now I'm a man</i>

01:06:01.117 --> 01:06:02.702
<i>"Way past twenty-one</i>

01:06:04.370 --> 01:06:06.372
<i>"I want you to believe me, baby</i>

01:06:07.707 --> 01:06:09.292
<i>"I have lots of fun</i>

01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:12.378
<i>"I'm a man"</i>

01:06:15.466 --> 01:06:17.468
<i>I introduced her to my friends.</i>

01:06:25.225 --> 01:06:27.228
<i>We made Barry our treasurer.</i>

01:06:30.398 --> 01:06:31.900
<i>Lana did production.</i>

01:06:33.067 --> 01:06:35.028
<i>I concentrated on sales.</i>

01:06:36.154 --> 01:06:38.448
So, you took her out to dinner twice.

01:06:38.823 --> 01:06:40.659
What did that cost you?

01:06:41.076 --> 01:06:42.161
About $30.

01:06:42.244 --> 01:06:43.287
With tip?

01:06:43.496 --> 01:06:44.830
Okay, maybe $35.

01:06:45.331 --> 01:06:46.707
Any movies?

01:06:47.166 --> 01:06:48.417
Three movies.

01:06:48.584 --> 01:06:49.668
$20.

01:06:50.836 --> 01:06:51.837
Parking?

01:06:51.921 --> 01:06:53.464
I park on the street.

01:06:53.756 --> 01:06:54.633
Gas?

01:06:56.259 --> 01:06:57.511
Maybe $6.

01:06:59.846 --> 01:07:02.682
All right, Stan, you're in for roughly $60.

01:07:09.482 --> 01:07:10.733
What happened?

01:07:12.276 --> 01:07:13.986
She slept with Jacobsen.

01:07:18.199 --> 01:07:19.826
That's all I'm saying.

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:24.164
<i>"I can make love to you, woman</i>

01:07:25.374 --> 01:07:27.042
<i>"In five minutes' time</i>

01:07:28.627 --> 01:07:30.087
<i>"Ain't that a man?"</i>

01:07:36.719 --> 01:07:39.055
Do you know what he said... afterwards?

01:07:40.723 --> 01:07:43.059
He said the lady had knowledge.

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:45.812
He was glad to get that knowledge.

01:07:46.146 --> 01:07:47.522
Do you know why?

01:07:47.897 --> 01:07:48.774
Why?

01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:52.403
Because college girls can smell ignorance...

01:07:53.404 --> 01:07:54.780
...like dog shit.

01:07:55.322 --> 01:07:56.824
I'll think about it.

01:07:57.741 --> 01:07:59.160
Where are you going to school next year?

01:07:59.243 --> 01:08:00.369
Wisconsin.

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:02.079
Wisconsin?

01:08:03.498 --> 01:08:04.624
Big school.

01:08:24.270 --> 01:08:26.063
All I'm saying is...

01:08:27.439 --> 01:08:28.941
...walk like a man.

01:08:57.139 --> 01:08:59.350
Joel! This is a great party!

01:09:01.227 --> 01:09:03.020
Are you having a good time?

01:09:11.404 --> 01:09:13.907
Excellent idea, Joel! Really excellent.

01:09:20.412 --> 01:09:23.082
Some of the girls are wearing
my mother's clothing.

01:09:23.166 --> 01:09:24.417
What's wrong with that?

01:09:24.502 --> 01:09:26.629
I don't want to spend the rest
of my life in analysis.

01:09:26.712 --> 01:09:28.923
- Just talk to them, okay?
- All right.

01:10:13.888 --> 01:10:15.431
Is Howie Rifkin here?

01:10:15.848 --> 01:10:17.266
You're on, honey.

01:10:40.208 --> 01:10:42.877
Joel! Somebody is at the front door
for you.

01:10:43.211 --> 01:10:45.838
All right, thank you. I'll be right there.

01:10:46.924 --> 01:10:48.467
The thing is...

01:10:49.927 --> 01:10:51.887
...I don't have to pay for it.

01:10:54.556 --> 01:10:55.891
I get it anyway.

01:11:01.564 --> 01:11:04.275
I'm going to get going
or I'll miss the party.

01:11:09.572 --> 01:11:11.658
Whatever you want to do...

01:11:25.923 --> 01:11:27.801
Excuse me. Can I help you?

01:11:28.426 --> 01:11:29.636
Are you Joel?

01:11:30.303 --> 01:11:31.138
Yes.

01:11:31.304 --> 01:11:33.181
Bill Rutherford, Princeton Admissions.

01:11:33.265 --> 01:11:35.725
I believe we had an interview scheduled.

01:11:36.268 --> 01:11:38.228
If this is inconvenient for you...

01:11:38.311 --> 01:11:39.813
No, sir. It's fine.

01:11:50.116 --> 01:11:52.118
Is it okay if I have the room?

01:11:55.456 --> 01:11:58.542
Also, could you catch the phone
if anyone calls, please?

01:11:58.625 --> 01:12:01.712
I understand that you would like
to attend Princeton.

01:12:02.796 --> 01:12:04.548
Yes, sir, very much.

01:12:04.923 --> 01:12:06.300
Well, fine.

01:12:07.009 --> 01:12:09.637
Let's take a look at what we have,
shall we?

01:12:23.694 --> 01:12:25.237
Does this couch open?

01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:27.448
Lana, I'm in a meeting.

01:12:27.531 --> 01:12:28.908
We need the room.

01:12:29.658 --> 01:12:31.744
I need a few minutes, okay?

01:12:37.709 --> 01:12:40.045
Now, you've taken your SAT's already.

01:12:40.378 --> 01:12:44.633
Math: 597, Verbal: 560. Correct me
if my information is inaccurate.

01:12:46.176 --> 01:12:49.387
Well, yes, but I was planning on taking
those again.

01:12:49.513 --> 01:12:52.475
Fine. Now, your grade point
average is 3.14.

01:12:53.684 --> 01:12:55.394
You class rank: 52...

01:12:55.728 --> 01:12:59.190
...which places you in the 84th percentile.
Is that correct?

01:13:00.024 --> 01:13:02.693
Joel, this is my cousin, Ruben,
from Skokie.

01:13:03.027 --> 01:13:04.279
Can you get him in tonight?

01:13:04.363 --> 01:13:05.697
Not now, okay?

01:13:05.864 --> 01:13:08.909
- He has to be back by 12:00.
- All right, later guys.

01:13:14.665 --> 01:13:15.749
Excuse me.

01:13:18.044 --> 01:13:19.879
And you wish to major in?

01:13:22.549 --> 01:13:23.633
Business.

01:13:24.592 --> 01:13:26.136
Business. Yes.

01:13:31.100 --> 01:13:32.810
I'll be out in a second.

01:13:37.565 --> 01:13:40.276
Fine, well, let's see what else there is.

01:13:40.734 --> 01:13:44.614
"Junior Varsity Tennis Team,
Recording Secretary, Spanish Club...

01:13:47.117 --> 01:13:49.327
"...Varsity Track Team: One year...

01:13:49.411 --> 01:13:52.330
"...Honorable Mention:
Cook County Science Fair...

01:13:53.748 --> 01:13:56.376
"...Future Enterprisers, Yearbook Staff...

01:13:58.296 --> 01:14:00.423
"...Student Council: Two years."

01:14:02.258 --> 01:14:04.844
Well, Joel, this is very respectable.

01:14:06.429 --> 01:14:08.931
You've done some very solid work here...

01:14:09.974 --> 01:14:12.478
...but it isn't quite Ivy League, is it?

01:14:18.150 --> 01:14:19.776
You know, Bill...

01:14:21.278 --> 01:14:24.323
...there's one thing I've learned
in all my years.

01:14:24.948 --> 01:14:27.785
Sometimes you have to say,
"What the fuck."

01:14:28.828 --> 01:14:30.121
Make your move.

01:14:32.290 --> 01:14:33.750
I beg your pardon?

01:14:36.127 --> 01:14:37.712
So, how are we doing?

01:14:38.463 --> 01:14:40.591
Looks like University of Illinois!

01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:42.635
<i>"All right, all right!</i>

01:14:43.344 --> 01:14:45.471
<i>"Dance, Music, Sex, Romance!</i>

01:14:46.305 --> 01:14:48.641
<i>"Everybody say, Oooh, all right!</i>

01:14:51.811 --> 01:14:53.939
<i>"Dance, Music, Sex, Romance!</i>

01:14:58.151 --> 01:15:00.487
<i>"Everybody clap your hands now!"</i>

01:15:23.554 --> 01:15:26.098
Some of your friends are looking for you.

01:15:28.892 --> 01:15:31.019
What do you want me to tell them?

01:15:34.399 --> 01:15:36.693
Has that guy from Princeton left yet?

01:15:36.901 --> 01:15:39.946
No, he's still here.
He's talking to some of the girls.

01:15:40.029 --> 01:15:41.030
Talking?

01:15:41.698 --> 01:15:43.491
They're very good talkers.

01:15:46.536 --> 01:15:49.748
I don't think I'm going to say,
"What the fuck" anymore.

01:15:50.708 --> 01:15:53.294
This thing has gotten way out of control.

01:15:56.088 --> 01:15:57.798
I'm going to kill Miles.

01:15:58.549 --> 01:16:00.050
Oh, come on, Joel.

01:16:02.762 --> 01:16:05.891
Look at it this way.
You're making a lot of money.

01:16:06.558 --> 01:16:09.269
You're providing your friends
with an invaluable service.

01:16:09.352 --> 01:16:11.521
God knows, they needed the service!

01:16:12.606 --> 01:16:16.152
And, right now, you are one hot-shit
future enterpriser.

01:16:20.781 --> 01:16:23.493
Don't worry so much. I'll be upstairs.

01:16:27.246 --> 01:16:29.750
And... you have a girlfriend to boot.

01:16:30.876 --> 01:16:31.793
Do I?

01:16:31.877 --> 01:16:33.587
Phone call for Joel.

01:16:33.796 --> 01:16:35.214
Here, I'll get it.

01:16:36.131 --> 01:16:37.257
Well, do I?

01:16:39.718 --> 01:16:41.136
What do you think?

01:16:41.637 --> 01:16:43.431
I don't know. You tell me.

01:16:43.723 --> 01:16:45.141
Yes? No? Maybe?

01:16:47.393 --> 01:16:48.311
Yes.

01:16:51.064 --> 01:16:51.898
No.

01:16:55.318 --> 01:16:56.278
Maybe.

01:17:01.075 --> 01:17:01.992
<i>Joel!</i>

01:17:03.244 --> 01:17:04.119
Dad?

01:17:04.245 --> 01:17:05.996
Who answered the phone?

01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:07.581
Just a friend, Dad.

01:17:07.748 --> 01:17:08.833
<i>Do I know her?</i>

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:10.669
Have you ever made love on a real train?

01:17:10.752 --> 01:17:12.128
I don't think so.

01:17:12.587 --> 01:17:13.964
He's got a girl.

01:17:14.589 --> 01:17:16.633
Let's make love on a real train.

01:17:17.425 --> 01:17:18.510
<i>Joel, are you there?</i>

01:17:18.593 --> 01:17:22.264
I'm still here, Dad. How is Mom?
Is everything all right?

01:17:23.265 --> 01:17:24.267
Let's go.

01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:26.060
Did I hear others there?

01:17:27.436 --> 01:17:29.147
Just a few friends, Dad.

01:17:33.025 --> 01:17:34.527
<i>Sounds like a party.</i>

01:17:35.611 --> 01:17:36.612
A party?

01:17:37.280 --> 01:17:39.199
Come on, let's be alone together.

01:17:39.283 --> 01:17:42.369
I don't remember giving
permission for a party, Joel.

01:17:44.705 --> 01:17:46.623
Honey, can you hear me?

01:17:47.374 --> 01:17:49.710
There's nothing wrong
with having friends over.

01:17:49.793 --> 01:17:52.463
Just use your best judgment.
We trust you.

01:17:53.214 --> 01:17:56.217
<i>We're coming in on United,</i>
<i>Flight 162 at 3:30.</i>

01:17:56.301 --> 01:17:57.552
<i>"Trust."</i>

01:17:58.219 --> 01:18:00.889
<i>Seems to me if there were any logic</i>
<i>to our language...</i>

01:18:00.972 --> 01:18:03.349
<i>..."trust" would be a four-letter word.</i>

01:18:05.311 --> 01:18:08.481
<i>The evening worked out well.</i>
<i>We had a good cash flow.</i>

01:18:09.648 --> 01:18:11.817
<i>Rutherford made a few new friends.</i>

01:18:12.985 --> 01:18:15.029
<i>He said he'd do his best for me.</i>

01:18:22.662 --> 01:18:24.831
<i>Finally, it was time to close shop.</i>

01:18:26.166 --> 01:18:27.918
<i>The girls were exhausted.</i>

01:18:28.502 --> 01:18:31.338
<i>Lana was hungry.</i>
<i>She wanted to go out for a bite.</i>

01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:35.009
<i>She wanted to make love on a real train.</i>

01:18:36.093 --> 01:18:37.595
<i>Who was I to say no?</i>

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:42.433
<i>"I can feel it coming in the air tonight</i>

01:18:50.025 --> 01:18:53.487
<i>"And I've been waiting for this moment</i>
<i>for all my life</i>

01:18:59.869 --> 01:19:01.871
<i>"Can you feel it coming"</i>

01:19:02.205 --> 01:19:04.541
I thought no one was going to be here.

01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:07.877
Be patient.

01:19:19.056 --> 01:19:20.724
<i>"Well, I remember</i>

01:19:21.976 --> 01:19:23.978
<i>"I remember</i> - <i>don't worry</i>

01:19:26.147 --> 01:19:28.150
<i>"How could I ever forget?</i>

01:19:29.401 --> 01:19:30.902
<i>"It's the first time</i>

01:19:32.487 --> 01:19:34.531
<i>"The last time we ever met</i>

01:19:39.161 --> 01:19:41.038
<i>"But I know the reason</i>

01:19:42.081 --> 01:19:44.208
<i>"Why you keep the silence up</i>

01:19:46.419 --> 01:19:48.296
<i>"No, you don't fool me</i>

01:19:49.755 --> 01:19:51.424
<i>"The hurt doesn't show</i>

01:19:52.175 --> 01:19:54.177
<i>"But the pain still grows</i>

01:19:54.845 --> 01:19:57.097
<i>"It's no stranger to you or me</i>

01:20:00.601 --> 01:20:03.353
<i>"I can feel it coming in the air tonight</i>

01:20:10.862 --> 01:20:14.407
<i>"Well, I've been waiting</i>
<i>for this moment for all my life</i>

01:20:21.039 --> 01:20:23.459
<i>"I can feel it in the air tonight"</i>

01:24:14.289 --> 01:24:15.124
<i>Hi.</i>

01:24:15.291 --> 01:24:17.210
They stole the goddamn house, Lana!

01:24:17.293 --> 01:24:18.961
<i>I'm not here right now.</i>

01:24:19.045 --> 01:24:21.088
<i>But if you'll leave your name and number...</i>

01:24:21.172 --> 01:24:23.758
<i>... I'll call you back as soon as possible.</i>

01:24:24.550 --> 01:24:26.344
They took everything!

01:24:26.511 --> 01:24:27.637
This is unbelievable!

01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:31.308
My parents will be home in two hours,
Lana, and they took fucking everything!

01:24:31.391 --> 01:24:33.644
<i>I don't know if you know</i>
<i>anything about this...</i>

01:24:33.727 --> 01:24:35.479
<i>... but you have to call me right away!</i>

01:24:35.562 --> 01:24:37.481
<i>I'm at the house: KL5-2121.</i>

01:24:37.731 --> 01:24:39.900
<i>Look, you've really got to help me!</i>

01:24:40.734 --> 01:24:42.654
Time of your life, huh, kid?

01:24:43.238 --> 01:24:44.489
Where's Lana?

01:24:44.572 --> 01:24:46.157
<i>Maybe she's on the choo-choo.</i>

01:24:46.241 --> 01:24:48.868
I hear she's got this thing
about choo-choos.

01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.162
I want to know who took my stuff.

01:24:51.246 --> 01:24:53.873
<i>I took your stuff, Joel, are you kidding?</i>

01:24:54.499 --> 01:24:56.585
Then you listen to me, buster!

01:24:56.669 --> 01:24:57.795
You a-hole!

01:24:58.087 --> 01:25:00.089
<i>If I don't get my stuff back...</i>

01:25:00.506 --> 01:25:01.382
Shit!

01:25:11.184 --> 01:25:12.269
"A-hole?"

01:25:13.103 --> 01:25:15.355
<i>I want my furniture back, right now!</i>

01:25:16.273 --> 01:25:17.524
Now, you listen to me.

01:25:17.607 --> 01:25:19.609
No, no! You listen to me!

01:25:21.027 --> 01:25:21.903
Shit!

01:25:28.619 --> 01:25:30.329
<i>This is getting boring.</i>

01:25:30.454 --> 01:25:33.082
Can I have my furniture back? Please?

01:25:34.292 --> 01:25:36.419
You listen to me, you little fuck!

01:25:37.796 --> 01:25:40.174
You not only took my two best girls...

01:25:40.549 --> 01:25:42.885
...you call me names and insult me!

01:25:44.219 --> 01:25:45.220
I'm sorry.

01:25:45.304 --> 01:25:47.222
<i>If I had any self-respect...</i>

01:25:47.306 --> 01:25:49.558
...it wouldn't just be the furniture...

01:25:49.641 --> 01:25:52.604
...it would be your legs! Your arms!
Your head!

01:25:55.315 --> 01:25:56.900
<i>Do we understand each other?</i>

01:25:56.983 --> 01:25:58.109
Yes, we do.

01:25:58.401 --> 01:26:00.778
No! Do we understand each other?

01:26:02.739 --> 01:26:04.742
<i>Yes, we understand each other.</i>

01:26:07.411 --> 01:26:09.538
Well, you're lucky in one respect.

01:26:10.831 --> 01:26:11.999
<i>What's that?</i>

01:26:13.501 --> 01:26:14.877
I like you, Joel.

01:26:16.837 --> 01:26:18.340
Don't you know that?

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.392
What time is it?

01:26:30.018 --> 01:26:31.144
It's 4:15.

01:26:32.355 --> 01:26:33.606
I'll find a cab.

01:26:33.689 --> 01:26:35.608
Something must have happened.

01:26:37.193 --> 01:26:38.110
Taxi!

01:26:43.991 --> 01:26:45.702
Joel, do you like music?

01:26:46.161 --> 01:26:48.080
This is beautiful equipment.

01:26:49.248 --> 01:26:51.208
What do you say, $300...

01:26:52.042 --> 01:26:53.752
...amps, speakers, the works?

01:26:53.835 --> 01:26:54.920
It's a bargain, Joel.

01:26:55.003 --> 01:26:58.215
If you go downtown anywhere,
it'd cost you double that.

01:26:59.342 --> 01:27:01.469
All right! The kid likes music!

01:27:15.442 --> 01:27:17.736
How about some women's outfits?

01:27:18.028 --> 01:27:20.030
You know, something for your mom?

01:27:20.114 --> 01:27:21.615
Should fit her okay.

01:27:21.866 --> 01:27:22.741
Yes.

01:27:23.033 --> 01:27:23.951
What?

01:27:24.201 --> 01:27:25.452
Yes, I'll buy it!

01:27:25.536 --> 01:27:27.455
I didn't give you a price yet.

01:27:27.539 --> 01:27:29.457
Can we get through this, please?

01:27:29.541 --> 01:27:30.542
$125.

01:27:35.714 --> 01:27:37.465
That's it, you have everything.

01:27:37.549 --> 01:27:38.842
Wait a minute.

01:27:42.388 --> 01:27:43.764
What about this?

01:27:44.891 --> 01:27:46.142
What's that?

01:27:46.726 --> 01:27:48.728
Some glass, artsy-fartsy thing.

01:27:49.729 --> 01:27:51.939
What have you got left, Joel?

01:27:52.064 --> 01:27:53.065
$40.

01:27:54.234 --> 01:27:57.404
I don't think I can go $40
on the artsy-fartsy thing.

01:27:57.988 --> 01:28:00.324
- What do you think, Vic?
- He's only got $40.

01:28:00.407 --> 01:28:01.992
I only have $40.

01:28:03.660 --> 01:28:05.037
We go $340?

01:28:05.913 --> 01:28:07.832
I'll spot you the $300.

01:28:08.166 --> 01:28:09.918
You're good for it, right?

01:28:10.418 --> 01:28:11.502
Certainly.

01:28:11.586 --> 01:28:12.754
I think he is too.

01:28:12.837 --> 01:28:13.755
Here!

01:28:13.838 --> 01:28:14.797
Catch!

01:28:27.353 --> 01:28:28.354
To Joel!

01:28:28.771 --> 01:28:32.441
Here's wishin' you good luck
on your future as a businessman!

01:28:32.775 --> 01:28:35.695
Because, God knows,
you're going to need it!

01:29:16.489 --> 01:29:18.241
Don't, you'll break it!

01:29:18.324 --> 01:29:21.327
That's good. Thank you,
thank you, thank you!

01:29:22.495 --> 01:29:26.916
I'd put all the Chinese things together,
and the Greek on a separate shelf.

01:29:27.166 --> 01:29:29.879
I don't think you should mix centuries.

01:29:46.021 --> 01:29:48.023
Mom! Dad! You're home!

01:29:50.692 --> 01:29:52.027
Where were you?

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:53.528
I was here.

01:29:53.695 --> 01:29:55.530
We called from the airport!

01:29:56.198 --> 01:29:58.367
I must have been out back watering.

01:29:58.534 --> 01:30:00.786
I thought you were coming
home tomorrow.

01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:02.705
Sweetheart, I said the 5th.

01:30:03.289 --> 01:30:05.541
No, you said the 6th. I wrote it down.

01:30:05.625 --> 01:30:07.585
I'm sure I said the 5th.

01:30:08.794 --> 01:30:10.379
Give me a hand with the luggage.

01:30:10.464 --> 01:30:11.840
She said the 6th.

01:30:15.802 --> 01:30:16.720
Joel?

01:30:16.887 --> 01:30:17.930
Yes, Mom?

01:30:19.389 --> 01:30:21.391
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:30:26.231 --> 01:30:27.941
What happened to my egg?

01:30:28.316 --> 01:30:29.692
What do you mean?

01:30:30.485 --> 01:30:32.070
There's a crack in it!

01:30:34.155 --> 01:30:35.448
You're kidding!

01:30:35.823 --> 01:30:37.617
No, Joel, I'm not kidding.

01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:40.246
There's a small crack, inside the egg.

01:30:40.579 --> 01:30:41.747
What's wrong?

01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:43.207
My egg is ruined.

01:30:43.832 --> 01:30:45.084
What happened?

01:30:46.585 --> 01:30:47.836
I don't know.

01:30:47.920 --> 01:30:49.213
You don't know.

01:30:50.923 --> 01:30:53.051
Mom, maybe it was there before.

01:30:53.343 --> 01:30:55.053
I don't think so, Joel.

01:30:55.262 --> 01:30:57.222
How could you let this happen?

01:31:00.267 --> 01:31:01.393
I'm sorry.

01:31:01.518 --> 01:31:03.770
This is so damned irresponsible of you!

01:31:03.854 --> 01:31:06.566
We'll get another one. Joel will pay for it.

01:31:07.441 --> 01:31:09.068
Sure, I'll pay for it.

01:31:10.278 --> 01:31:13.948
Where will you get the money
to pay for something like that?

01:31:14.949 --> 01:31:17.159
I'm very disappointed in you.

01:31:24.877 --> 01:31:26.211
She'll be all right.

01:31:26.295 --> 01:31:28.547
Why don't you put in some yard work?

01:32:28.779 --> 01:32:31.156
Do you have something to tell me?

01:32:34.618 --> 01:32:35.702
No...

01:32:36.495 --> 01:32:37.996
...I don't think so.

01:32:38.789 --> 01:32:42.001
I just got off the telephone
with Bill Rutherford.

01:32:44.879 --> 01:32:47.632
Apparently, you two had quite a meeting.

01:32:52.637 --> 01:32:54.974
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel."

01:32:57.059 --> 01:32:57.977
What?

01:32:58.477 --> 01:33:00.980
"Princeton can use a guy like Joel."

01:33:02.481 --> 01:33:03.857
His exact words!

01:33:06.068 --> 01:33:07.611
That's unbelievable!

01:33:07.736 --> 01:33:09.531
You're as good as in!

01:33:09.906 --> 01:33:11.616
I knew you could do it!

01:33:11.741 --> 01:33:14.494
Haven't I been telling you,
sometimes you have to say:

01:33:14.578 --> 01:33:16.997
"What the heck!" Take some chances.

01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:18.498
You were so right.

01:33:18.748 --> 01:33:20.500
You've made me very proud.

01:33:26.591 --> 01:33:28.259
I was just thinking...

01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:32.013
...where we might be ten years from now.

01:33:34.599 --> 01:33:36.476
You know what I think?

01:33:36.643 --> 01:33:39.021
I think we're both going to make it big!

01:33:39.104 --> 01:33:41.440
I'm very optimistic! I mean it!

01:33:45.861 --> 01:33:47.571
Can I ask you something?

01:33:52.452 --> 01:33:54.454
Was our night together...

01:33:57.457 --> 01:33:59.250
...just to set up...

01:34:00.293 --> 01:34:01.753
...Vicki and Guido?

01:34:11.263 --> 01:34:12.264
No.

01:34:13.974 --> 01:34:15.893
You don't believe me, do you?

01:34:18.146 --> 01:34:21.149
<i>My name is Russell Bitterman.</i>
<i>I'm from Wheaton High School.</i>

01:34:21.233 --> 01:34:24.819
<i>Our product is a paper-towel</i>
<i>holder that sells for $8.95.</i>

01:34:25.987 --> 01:34:28.698
<i>We made a profit of $850 last semester.</i>

01:34:35.581 --> 01:34:37.542
I don't want you to get hurt.

01:34:39.835 --> 01:34:43.756
<i>My name is Evonne Williams.</i>
<i>We sell decorative planters for $7.</i>

01:34:45.259 --> 01:34:47.970
<i>We made a profit of $500 last semester.</i>

01:34:51.181 --> 01:34:53.976
Guess we won't see each other for awhile.

01:34:54.518 --> 01:34:55.519
I know.

01:34:57.521 --> 01:34:59.190
Are you going straight home now?

01:34:59.274 --> 01:35:00.733
I don't know. Why?

01:35:01.192 --> 01:35:04.404
It might be nice if we spent
the evening together.

01:35:05.863 --> 01:35:07.490
I'd really like that.

01:35:08.866 --> 01:35:10.827
How much have you got on you?

01:35:12.538 --> 01:35:14.081
How much have I got on me?

01:35:14.164 --> 01:35:15.374
I've got $20.

01:35:16.041 --> 01:35:17.209
$20, Lana?

01:35:18.294 --> 01:35:20.462
What are we going to do about this?

01:35:20.546 --> 01:35:23.382
- Can I send it to you?
- Can you send it to me?

01:35:24.258 --> 01:35:26.177
'Cause I don't have that much here.

01:35:26.261 --> 01:35:27.804
How about I write you a check?

01:35:27.888 --> 01:35:31.349
Do you think I'd accept a check from you?
What am I, stupid?

01:35:32.559 --> 01:35:34.311
I have a bond at the bank.

01:35:35.896 --> 01:35:37.564

<i>I grossed over $8,000 in one night.</i>

01:35:45.907 --> 01:35:47.992
<i>The time of your life, huh, kid?</i>
