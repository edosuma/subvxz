<i>Blow out your candles,
sweetie.</i>

07:14.805 --> 07:17.276
Can I open presents now,
mommy?

07:17.309 --> 07:19.345
Sweetie,
what do we say?

07:19.378 --> 07:21.816
Please?

07:21.849 --> 07:23.718
All right.

07:23.750 --> 07:25.853
Actually,
Britney and Bella and I

07:25.887 --> 07:29.559
sort of have a special gift
for Sophia, if that's okay?

07:29.593 --> 07:31.360
It's fantastic.

07:31.394 --> 07:34.466
I love surprises.

07:34.498 --> 07:36.701
-Do you wanna go get it?
-Yeah, excuse me.

07:36.735 --> 07:39.738
Sophia, honey, what do you say
to Bella and Britney

07:39.772 --> 07:41.441
for getting you a surprise?

07:41.474 --> 07:43.511
Thank you!

07:43.544 --> 07:46.247
You're welcome.

07:50.319 --> 07:52.355
Mommy!

07:53.892 --> 07:55.627
I'm sorry,
will you take her away?

07:55.659 --> 07:58.864
She's terrified.

07:58.899 --> 08:02.436
It's okay, it's okay, sweetie.
She's gone away.

08:02.469 --> 08:04.304
I am so sorry.

08:04.337 --> 08:07.408
No, it's fine.
She's just sensitive.

08:07.442 --> 08:09.312
What do you think daddy?

08:09.344 --> 08:12.149
Think it's time
for our gift now?

08:12.182 --> 08:15.753
Yeah, that's a good idea.
You hold Winston for a sec?

08:15.786 --> 08:18.323
Yeah.

08:18.357 --> 08:20.627
Sophia, look what
I got for you.

08:20.661 --> 08:22.664
Look at this.

08:24.933 --> 08:28.404
It's so... big.

08:28.438 --> 08:29.507
Open it up.

08:33.844 --> 08:35.780
A puppy!

08:38.351 --> 08:41.655
-Okay!
-He's perfect.

08:41.688 --> 08:43.758
He's so cute!

08:43.791 --> 08:45.359
Is he all mine, daddy?

08:45.392 --> 08:46.863
Yeah, he sure is.

08:46.895 --> 08:48.797
Your mommy and I thought
that we should get Winston

08:48.831 --> 08:50.934
a companion for his last
few years with us,

08:50.967 --> 08:52.804
<i>you know,
make him feel young again.</i>

08:52.837 --> 08:55.507
Well, I better not be the one
cleaning up after him.

08:55.540 --> 08:57.242
<i>I'll help you.</i>

08:57.276 --> 08:59.713
You said that the last time.

08:59.745 --> 09:02.649
Can Winston
meet the new puppy?

09:02.682 --> 09:04.285
Yeah, sure.

09:04.318 --> 09:07.357
Hold on,
let me get my camera.

09:07.390 --> 09:10.394
<i>Okay, honey, be careful.
-Hi, Winston!</i>

09:10.426 --> 09:14.332
What have I got for you?

09:14.365 --> 09:18.403
You got a friend.

09:18.437 --> 09:19.807
Aw.

09:24.879 --> 09:27.950
See?
He likes him, daddy.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.555
Aw.

09:41.334 --> 09:43.404
Do it again!

09:46.875 --> 09:48.746
<i>I got blood in my hair!</i>

09:48.779 --> 09:51.650
<i>I got blood in my eyes!</i>

10:28.130 --> 10:30.534
<i>-Do we have any...
-Woman: Flashlights?</i>

10:30.568 --> 10:31.870
<i>I come prepared.</i>

10:34.506 --> 10:36.041
Yeah.

10:36.074 --> 10:40.547
There's plenty of space
up here for storage.

10:40.580 --> 10:42.817
Moving boxes,
your hideous couch...

10:42.850 --> 10:44.553
I know,
we'll make it your bedroom.

10:44.587 --> 10:46.021
Ha-ha.

10:48.824 --> 10:50.661
Looky here.

10:57.470 --> 10:59.072
It's locked.

10:59.105 --> 11:01.442
20 bucks says
it's full of old porn.

11:01.475 --> 11:02.545
Let me see.

11:04.179 --> 11:05.748
MacGyver taught me this.

11:05.781 --> 11:06.950
Right.

11:19.199 --> 11:20.634
-Creepy.
-Cool.

11:27.910 --> 11:30.080
<i>Hello?</i>

11:30.113 --> 11:31.916
Brian?

11:31.949 --> 11:34.085
<i>Hey where you guys do
wanna put these chairs?</i>

11:34.118 --> 11:35.754
Why did we
ask him to help?

11:35.787 --> 11:37.022
We didn't.
He volunteered.

11:37.056 --> 11:39.159
Dude,
turn on the lights!

11:41.228 --> 11:42.697
God.

11:44.799 --> 11:46.502
New house.

11:46.536 --> 11:47.871
New roommate.

11:47.903 --> 11:49.940
New adventures.

11:49.974 --> 11:51.042
Cheers.

11:52.911 --> 11:55.715
Thanks, Brian, for lifting
all the heavy stuff.

11:55.747 --> 11:57.483
Of course.

11:57.516 --> 11:59.086
Well,
back to unpacking.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.925
Yay.

12:07.028 --> 12:09.632
So...

12:09.666 --> 12:11.203
What's the plan?

12:11.236 --> 12:14.073
Well, my closet's smaller now.

12:14.106 --> 12:16.209
Only problem with this house.

12:16.243 --> 12:20.047
So I'm gonna pick out
some shoes to give away.

12:20.081 --> 12:21.850
I'm only gonna cry a little.

12:21.883 --> 12:24.019
No, I mean what's
the plan for tonight?

12:24.052 --> 12:25.856
Are we doing anything?

12:25.889 --> 12:27.823
Celebrating or anything?

12:27.858 --> 12:32.097
No, I think we're
just gonna unpack, get settled.

12:32.129 --> 12:34.701
Cool.

12:38.938 --> 12:40.608
What the...

12:51.557 --> 12:53.592
Raccoon.

12:53.625 --> 12:55.761
You know, you should probably
get somebody on the...

12:55.794 --> 12:58.632
First night's adventure!
Hey, Kristen!

12:58.666 --> 13:00.636
Um, actually...

13:00.668 --> 13:04.072
I was gonna say you should call
an exterminator, but I mean...

13:04.105 --> 13:05.741
Kristen?

13:05.774 --> 13:08.212
Well,
she'll miss all the fun.

13:13.819 --> 13:15.789
I can go up first.

13:15.821 --> 13:17.825
I ain't afraid
of no raccoons.

13:19.927 --> 13:22.899
Yeah, 'cause rabies
is all the rage nowadays.

13:35.380 --> 13:38.718
God, Kristen.

13:38.751 --> 13:39.920
You scared me.

13:41.255 --> 13:44.026
Dude, the lights!

13:44.059 --> 13:45.129
God.

13:56.777 --> 13:57.945
Guys?

14:00.081 --> 14:02.384
Is this a joke?

14:08.660 --> 14:09.728
Kristen?

14:27.917 --> 14:30.054
Bertrand,
my good fellow.

14:30.087 --> 14:32.324
Can I invite you round
for some tea?

14:32.357 --> 14:34.760
Perhaps a scone?

14:34.794 --> 14:37.296
No, I'm sorry,
old chap,

14:37.329 --> 14:39.433
but I dined
not an hour hence.

14:39.467 --> 14:42.204
I ate at that the new
cultist delicatessen

14:42.236 --> 14:44.240
over on innsmouth terrace.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.409
I've seen the place.

14:46.442 --> 14:48.780
How fares the cuisine?

14:48.813 --> 14:50.182
Fine, fine.

14:50.214 --> 14:52.216
But the eggs
were a strange lot...

14:52.250 --> 14:55.387
The size of my fist,
leathery,

14:55.421 --> 14:59.428
and constantly shifting in
iridescent color.

14:59.461 --> 15:02.231
Well, that's like no egg
I've ever seen,

15:02.264 --> 15:04.167
and I'm an egg-ologist.

15:04.199 --> 15:07.336
They've left my stomach
in somewhat of a tizzy.

15:08.873 --> 15:11.243
I don't feel too well at all.

15:16.751 --> 15:19.020
No!

15:22.458 --> 15:24.127
-No!
-Yes!

15:24.160 --> 15:26.097
-No!
-Yes!

15:26.129 --> 15:28.099
-No!
-Yes!

17:44.448 --> 17:47.286
Hello?!

17:47.318 --> 17:50.656
Help!

17:52.357 --> 17:55.362
Please!

20:19.355 --> 20:22.426
-Time?
-15 minutes 22 seconds.

20:22.458 --> 20:24.361
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:24.395 --> 20:28.367
the young Philly daystar
with a run of 15:22

20:28.399 --> 20:30.570
has taken the lead in her heat.

20:30.602 --> 20:32.739
In second place overall.

20:32.773 --> 20:34.909
<i>-15:22 did you say?
-Yes.</i>

20:34.941 --> 20:37.812
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
15 minutes 22 seconds</i>

20:37.845 --> 20:41.385
is only 36 seconds
under the absolute best run

20:41.417 --> 20:43.520
for a first-time competitor
in this event.

20:46.491 --> 20:49.395
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you look to the competitor

20:49.427 --> 20:51.297
<i>in the right it looks
like spectacular bid</i>

20:51.330 --> 20:52.666
<i>is making his move.</i>

20:52.698 --> 20:54.369
<i>Let's hope he makes it
under the gun.</i>

20:54.401 --> 20:56.639
Wonderful job, my darling.

20:56.671 --> 20:58.606
You did an excellent run
for a first timer

20:58.640 --> 21:00.643
and especially
for your weight class.

21:00.677 --> 21:02.847
You completed my...
Completely

21:02.880 --> 21:05.316
and gave me a pretty bunny,
I don't mind telling you.

21:08.554 --> 21:10.657
Go on, there you go.

21:10.690 --> 21:12.927
There you go.

21:12.960 --> 21:16.464
I just can't wait to see
what you do in round two.

21:27.679 --> 21:29.416
<i>I don't have all day.</i>

21:29.449 --> 21:30.784
<i>I've got a lot
of other deliveries to get to,</i>

21:30.816 --> 21:32.519
<i>and you're holding me up.</i>

21:32.553 --> 21:34.287
<i>Can you please just sign this
so I can leave?</i>

21:34.321 --> 21:35.524
Here's a pen,
here's the page.

21:35.557 --> 21:36.892
Just sign it at the "x."

21:38.760 --> 21:41.698
Hey, sorry, long day.

21:41.732 --> 21:43.635
Can either of you sign this?
Anyone?

21:43.667 --> 21:45.270
What's this?

21:45.302 --> 21:47.939
Mom's stuff.
There's so much.

21:47.973 --> 21:50.877
-Your mom's stuff?
-You kidding me?

21:50.909 --> 21:52.880
Please just sign this.
Are you even listening to me?

21:52.912 --> 21:54.748
Are you gonna leave
all the stuff here?

21:54.782 --> 21:57.820
It's a delivery.
I delivered it. Here it is.

21:57.852 --> 21:59.422
Okay, I got it.

22:04.663 --> 22:05.998
Let us help you.

22:09.367 --> 22:12.639
Come on.
Let's get this sorted.

22:25.990 --> 22:27.425
<i>Holger.</i>

22:33.599 --> 22:35.369
Are you okay?

22:35.403 --> 22:37.507
Did you just say my name?

22:37.540 --> 22:39.375
What?

22:39.407 --> 22:41.945
It sounded like you just said
my name right next to me.

23:05.844 --> 23:07.414
Sorry.

23:14.522 --> 23:16.859
It's okay.
Thank you.

23:16.891 --> 23:20.963
Okay.
Let's keep moving.

23:31.412 --> 23:33.482
Weird.

23:33.514 --> 23:36.385
<i>-It sounded like you were
right next to me. Laura.</i>

23:38.922 --> 23:41.525
Christy?

23:41.558 --> 23:42.828
Did you just say my name?

23:52.672 --> 23:54.742
<i>Laura, Laura come here.</i>

23:54.776 --> 23:57.480
<i>Laura, it's okay.</i>

23:57.512 --> 23:59.483
Okay, it's nothing.

24:06.992 --> 24:09.163
How rude.

24:09.196 --> 24:11.698
After everything today,

24:11.732 --> 24:14.669
the ghost doesn't
even say my name.

24:14.703 --> 24:15.971
That's what I
was about to say.

24:16.004 --> 24:17.873
It wasn't just
that it said my name, it...

24:17.907 --> 24:20.178
-It sounded just like you.
-Exactly like you.

24:20.210 --> 24:23.516
-And you wanted me to.
-I didn't say anything.

24:30.223 --> 24:33.462
The building lights
must be messed up again.

24:33.494 --> 24:35.497
I'm gonna go.

24:59.829 --> 25:00.897
<i>Let's play.</i>

25:42.888 --> 25:44.156
Hey guys, where's Ella?

25:48.260 --> 25:49.730
<i>We should look for her.</i>

26:04.949 --> 26:06.285
Is he serious?

26:10.190 --> 26:14.128
This is insane.

26:14.161 --> 26:16.132
Look, we've already established
this whole thing is insane.

26:16.164 --> 26:18.802
Quick, we only have four
and a half minutes to decide.

26:18.836 --> 26:20.270
Now, wait, the quicker
we gang up on each other,

26:20.304 --> 26:21.873
the quicker
they can kill us...

26:21.905 --> 26:23.942
If we don't choose,
any one of us could die.

26:23.974 --> 26:26.979
Do you wanna be responsible
for someone else's death?

26:27.012 --> 26:31.652
Amber's right.
We can't choose.

26:31.686 --> 26:33.923
Jesus, Ella,
where did you get that?

26:33.956 --> 26:36.126
I nominate Ivy
to be the one who dies.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.629
Me?

26:38.661 --> 26:40.931
I know who
you are now.

26:40.965 --> 26:43.068
I'm not following, El.

26:43.101 --> 26:46.973
They never released
the name to my family

26:47.006 --> 26:50.076
because the driver
was a minor.

26:50.109 --> 26:54.149
She pled guilty.
Did her time, supposedly.

26:55.818 --> 26:58.222
Ivy was the drunk driver
who killed my sister.

27:01.091 --> 27:03.795
Is that true?

27:03.829 --> 27:07.067
It was a
really dark time, okay?

27:07.100 --> 27:09.737
I'm not the same person
I was back then.

27:09.769 --> 27:13.307
You still drink.

27:13.341 --> 27:17.013
You still have fun.
And guess what?

27:17.046 --> 27:19.049
My sister doesn't get to!

27:19.083 --> 27:20.452
El!

27:20.484 --> 27:23.422
You think I don't live
with that every day?

27:23.455 --> 27:26.292
I do!
I've changed.

27:26.326 --> 27:30.231
<i>They tried to drive
us all crazy, one by one.</i>

27:30.264 --> 27:32.735
<i>Some of the girls
think we're a team.</i>

27:32.767 --> 27:36.205
<i>Deep down, we know the truth.
We're all alone.</i>

27:36.238 --> 27:38.976
Wait,
it's not what you think.

27:39.008 --> 27:40.911
<i>Truth is...</i>

27:40.945 --> 27:44.217
<i>I don't give a fuck
about any of them.</i>

27:44.249 --> 27:47.721
<i>If being here
has taught me anything</i>

27:47.754 --> 27:50.024
<i>it's to look out
for number one.</i>

27:50.058 --> 27:51.893
<i>Screw everyone else.</i>

27:51.925 --> 27:54.429
-Is that from the confession room?
-No, no!

27:54.463 --> 27:56.133
I don't even know
how they have that.

27:56.166 --> 27:58.335
You heard it yourself,
girls.

27:58.368 --> 28:00.504
She'd stab anyone of us
in the back if she had the...

28:00.537 --> 28:04.209
Let's just turn it down and
let's just talk about it, okay?

28:04.243 --> 28:07.782
That recording was made
a long time ago.

28:07.815 --> 28:09.450
Please, you guys
have to believe me.

28:09.482 --> 28:12.287
Let's take a vote.
Majority rules.

28:12.319 --> 28:15.791
-I vote we choose Ivy.
-Come on, Ella.

28:15.825 --> 28:17.895
Is that really what
your sister would want?

28:17.927 --> 28:19.830
Don't fucking talk
about my sister!

28:19.864 --> 28:21.064
Stop it, you guys!

28:21.065 --> 28:23.002
This is exactly
what they want us to do.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.805
-We have to vote, Amber.
-No, we don't.

28:25.839 --> 28:27.474
I wholeheartedly agree.

28:27.506 --> 28:32.448
-Lila?
-I vote...

28:32.480 --> 28:34.950
I choose Ivy.

28:34.984 --> 28:36.920
<i>Always look out
for number one, right?</i>

28:36.952 --> 28:38.955
Just think
what you are doing.

28:38.988 --> 28:40.558
That's two for and two against.

28:40.592 --> 28:43.163
You're the tiebreaker, Shelly.
What's your vote?

28:43.195 --> 28:46.031
<i>Shelly!</i>

28:46.065 --> 28:48.903
She said herself
she'd take us all out.

28:48.935 --> 28:52.809
<i>If it has to be one of us...</i>

28:52.841 --> 28:53.975
I choose Ivy.

28:56.379 --> 28:58.149
Get her on the ground.

28:58.181 --> 29:02.287
Ella? Ella. Please.
Please don't do this.

29:02.321 --> 29:04.491
Ella.

29:05.892 --> 29:07.161
Please don't do this.

29:07.193 --> 29:10.064
You took my sister
away from me.

29:10.097 --> 29:11.866
I'm so sorry.

29:11.900 --> 29:14.304
This won't bring her back.

29:14.337 --> 29:15.973
I loved her so much.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.540
<i>Ella, look at me.</i>

29:17.573 --> 29:19.009
How dare you.

29:19.042 --> 29:20.111
Look at me.

29:22.648 --> 29:24.317
You don't want this.

29:41.172 --> 29:43.343
<i>Ivy, no!</i>

30:05.270 --> 30:06.340
Do it.

30:09.077 --> 30:11.346
-I'll do it. I'll do it.
-Do it, you wussy.

30:11.378 --> 30:13.515
-Freaking shut up. Shut up.
-So, it, piece of crap.

30:13.549 --> 30:16.486
-Shut up. Shut up. Shut up, shut up.
-Do it. Do it.

30:16.520 --> 30:19.190
You trust me?

30:19.223 --> 30:20.659
-Do it, you wuss.
-You want me to?

30:20.693 --> 30:22.995
-Yeah. Yeah, come on do it.
-Yeah?

30:23.027 --> 30:25.932
-I'm gonna put this right in your brain.
-Great, do it.

30:25.966 --> 30:27.235
Trust?

31:29.284 --> 31:31.387
Uncle.

31:31.420 --> 31:33.023
Seriously?

31:33.056 --> 31:35.291
Yeah, you're aiming it
right at me.

31:35.325 --> 31:37.161
This isn't even the closest
I've come all day.

31:37.193 --> 31:39.063
I know, you win.

31:39.097 --> 31:40.264
What, you didn't trust me?

32:06.666 --> 32:08.669
<i>Hey, it's Brad.</i>

32:08.703 --> 32:12.340
<i>I'm planning to come by
and get my stuff.</i>

32:12.374 --> 32:15.546
<i>You and I both know
this is for the best.</i>

32:15.579 --> 32:17.100
<i>Please don't be around
when I come by.</i>

32:48.724 --> 32:51.695
<i>Hey, it's Brad.</i>

32:51.728 --> 32:53.630
<i>I'm planning to come by
and get my stuff.</i>

32:53.662 --> 32:55.432
<i>You and I both know
this is for the best...</i>

32:55.466 --> 32:57.803
<i>Hey, it's Brad.</i>

32:57.836 --> 33:00.440
<i>I'm planning to come by
and get my stuff.</i>

33:00.472 --> 33:01.741
<i>You and I both know
this is for the best...</i>

33:01.773 --> 33:03.476
<i>Hey, it's Brad</i>

34:27.856 --> 34:29.425
I can't keep it.

35:34.746 --> 35:35.914
Here's your stuff.

35:46.460 --> 35:50.132
This was yours, too,
isn't it?

36:22.509 --> 36:24.747
I'll put you away later.

37:06.201 --> 37:08.471
What the hell?

37:08.505 --> 37:10.539
Go on,
get out of here, go!

37:10.572 --> 37:12.576
Go! Shoo!

37:22.021 --> 37:23.190
Apple?

37:41.748 --> 37:44.218
Yes, yes,
I'll be right upstairs.

37:44.252 --> 37:47.223
<i>No, no, the last one I was
telling you about.</i>

37:47.255 --> 37:51.262
Yeah, for sure.
Give me a call back later.

37:51.294 --> 37:53.098
<i>Tomato.</i>

37:57.236 --> 37:58.538
Cow.

38:11.988 --> 38:14.726
You fucking kid!

38:19.265 --> 38:23.138
Hey! What are you doing
out here?!

38:23.171 --> 38:24.939
Fish.

38:31.180 --> 38:32.750
People.

38:39.959 --> 38:41.628
Fish.

38:41.661 --> 38:43.298
What the hell are you
doing in my house?!

38:51.807 --> 38:54.211
People. Fish.

38:54.245 --> 38:55.914
Could you just
not do that?

39:01.188 --> 39:02.791
That better be your parents.

39:05.292 --> 39:08.163
Hi, hi, hi, hi!
My name is grace.

39:08.197 --> 39:10.167
I'm your neighbor.
I have an eight-year old son.

39:10.200 --> 39:12.771
<i>And Mr. Schultz said
that he saw him here with you?</i>

39:12.804 --> 39:15.240
<i>Yes, yes,
he's right upstairs...</i>

39:15.273 --> 39:17.042
People.

39:17.075 --> 39:18.879
<i>He knows not to go up there!</i>

39:18.911 --> 39:21.617
I've told him a thousand times
not to go up there!

39:25.120 --> 39:27.323
So the next thing you know,
he's screaming bloody murder.

39:27.355 --> 39:30.293
I run to his room,
and he is completely gone.

39:30.325 --> 39:32.696
No.

39:32.730 --> 39:34.700
You can't possibly imagine.

39:34.733 --> 39:36.770
But he's safe.
Thank god.

39:36.803 --> 39:39.273
Bread. Fish.

39:39.306 --> 39:43.145
Okay, I have to ask.

39:43.178 --> 39:45.080
What is he doing,
and why is he doing that?

39:45.113 --> 39:46.882
Is it like tourette's?

39:46.915 --> 39:49.119
No, it's nothing like that.

39:49.151 --> 39:51.422
<i>-Okay, good.
-It's his psychic ability.</i>

39:51.455 --> 39:54.859
Um, what?

39:54.892 --> 39:57.096
Although it's not
what one might expect.

39:57.129 --> 39:59.098
Trevor's psychic ability

39:59.131 --> 40:01.768
is merely to know
the last things somebody ate.

40:01.802 --> 40:04.873
-Bread.
-Very good.

40:04.906 --> 40:06.342
Fish.

40:06.375 --> 40:09.280
My god, he's right.
I had Sushi for lunch,

40:09.312 --> 40:13.085
-yes.
-It's an interesting ability.

40:13.118 --> 40:16.856
There's a really cute little
diner called shallow fork,

40:16.888 --> 40:19.158
they have really great pastries.
And it's really good coffee.

40:19.192 --> 40:21.646
I owe you a meal at the
least. It's the least I can do.

40:21.647 --> 40:22.464
Not at all.

40:22.497 --> 40:26.368
Thank you again
for everything.

40:26.401 --> 40:29.238
Bread. Fish. People.

40:29.271 --> 40:31.276
Come on.

40:37.549 --> 40:40.253
No, she is not as crazy
as he is.

40:40.286 --> 40:42.224
But get this...

40:42.256 --> 40:45.360
Apparently he has
a psychic ability.

40:45.393 --> 40:49.532
No, I'm serious.

40:49.566 --> 40:53.004
God, no, no,
it's nothing cool.

40:53.036 --> 40:55.106
His psychic ability
is to know

40:55.139 --> 40:56.843
the last thing
that somebody ate.

40:56.875 --> 40:58.377
It's the lamest thing ever.

41:30.187 --> 41:32.858
No, no buddy.

41:32.891 --> 41:34.493
Tonight's dinner
is for me and a guest.

41:38.130 --> 41:41.068
Norman. Norman.

41:41.102 --> 41:44.240
Hi, hi.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

41:44.272 --> 41:45.408
That's okay.

41:45.440 --> 41:46.843
This is Norman.

41:46.876 --> 41:48.244
Hi, Norman.

41:48.278 --> 41:49.519
He's a really,
really sweet boy.

41:49.547 --> 41:51.282
I'm sure he is.

41:51.315 --> 41:53.018
Hi.
Come this way.

41:53.050 --> 41:54.920
Okay.

41:54.952 --> 41:56.589
A little surprise.

41:56.622 --> 41:58.225
Here you go.

41:59.425 --> 42:00.862
How cute.

42:00.894 --> 42:02.598
Yeah, thank you.

42:05.268 --> 42:08.171
I'm gonna go get our food.

42:08.204 --> 42:09.439
Okay.

42:11.643 --> 42:14.581
Norman, stay.
Good boy, good boy.

42:28.131 --> 42:31.168
I did. I did.

42:31.201 --> 42:33.304
-You're a really good cook.
-Thank you.

42:33.337 --> 42:35.073
This is like...
It's impressive.

42:35.106 --> 42:36.676
Well, you're the first
girl I've had over

42:36.710 --> 42:40.247
to try my meat balls.

42:40.280 --> 42:41.916
Did you actually
just say that?

42:41.950 --> 42:43.219
I did, I did.

42:43.252 --> 42:45.421
So I have to work
tomorrow morning.

42:45.454 --> 42:46.891
Okay.

42:48.692 --> 42:50.995
I brought
an overnight bag, though.

42:54.700 --> 42:56.235
Cool.

42:59.572 --> 43:02.644
Sorry. Norman, Norman.

43:04.447 --> 43:07.017
Norman, Norman,
come here, boy, come here.

43:07.050 --> 43:09.221
Stay, stay, stay.

43:16.196 --> 43:17.999
<i>Don't go.</i>

43:18.032 --> 43:20.200
-I have to go at work.
-Okay.

43:56.784 --> 43:58.552
<i>Eva, you still here?</i>

44:02.290 --> 44:04.593
<i>Eva, you still here?</i>

45:36.583 --> 45:38.653
<i>This is Eva.</i>

45:38.686 --> 45:40.422
<i>-If I know you,
leave me a message.</i>

45:40.455 --> 45:43.393
<i>Hey, Eva, it's Jonah.</i>

45:43.425 --> 45:46.497
<i>I just wanted to say I had
a great time the other night...</i>

45:46.529 --> 45:47.899
<i>Again.</i>

45:47.932 --> 45:51.838
I... I hope to hear
from you again soon.

45:51.870 --> 45:53.939
Bye.

45:53.972 --> 45:57.711
I know.
I know, boy, I know.

45:57.745 --> 45:59.915
<i>I'm not good enough
for another one.</i>

46:01.951 --> 46:04.521
<i>Gimme a kiss.
Gimme a kiss.</i>

46:21.744 --> 46:25.749
No, wait, no! No!

46:33.593 --> 46:35.728
<i>No.</i>

46:39.968 --> 46:43.773
<i>Please! Please, no!</i>

46:43.806 --> 46:46.477
<i>Help me! Help me!</i>

46:46.510 --> 46:49.815
<i>Please!
Please, help me!</i>

46:49.848 --> 46:51.818
This shit
is so predictable.

46:51.850 --> 46:54.788
<i>Yeah.
Killer in a goofy mask</i>

46:54.821 --> 46:58.325
<i>stalks helpless teens,
kills them and gets killed.</i>

46:58.358 --> 47:00.028
Or does he?

47:00.062 --> 47:02.364
It's not about the plot.
It's about the execution.

47:02.397 --> 47:05.569
<i>Or executions,
am I right?</i>

47:20.956 --> 47:24.628
Classic.

47:24.660 --> 47:26.497
<i>You can take all of my clothes</i>

47:26.531 --> 47:28.366
<i>and leave me nothing
but a towel to dry with.</i>

47:28.399 --> 47:31.037
<i>I couldn't run away
without clothes.</i>

47:31.070 --> 47:33.040
<i>I don't know.</i>

47:33.073 --> 47:35.943
<i>Well, then you could
watch me while I take the bath</i>

47:35.976 --> 47:37.979
<i>to make sure I don't
try anything.</i>

47:39.647 --> 47:41.817
<i>God damn it!</i>

47:51.597 --> 47:54.467
All right, I'm gonna
go drain the python.

47:54.500 --> 47:56.070
I always thought of you
as having

47:56.104 --> 47:58.073
more of the garden variety.

48:22.905 --> 48:25.776
You know you're too good
for him, right?

48:30.883 --> 48:32.886
Hey, hey, hey.

48:32.919 --> 48:35.655
More importantly is he knows.

48:35.688 --> 48:39.060
I think he'd do, like,
anything for me.

48:39.093 --> 48:41.797
He'd give me his left arm
if I asked him to.

48:44.834 --> 48:49.441
-What the hell?
-Paul?

48:53.045 --> 48:54.448
Run!

48:58.587 --> 48:59.889
I'll take my own advice.

49:16.177 --> 49:18.580
God!

49:18.614 --> 49:19.749
Nancy.

49:25.723 --> 49:28.027
Nancy. Nancy.

50:12.052 --> 50:14.555
P-please.

50:14.587 --> 50:15.724
Please.

50:15.756 --> 50:16.892
I'm coming for you, Paul.

50:16.925 --> 50:18.495
My god, please!

50:29.141 --> 50:32.813
You killed my fucking friends,
you asshole!

50:53.874 --> 50:55.944
You stay dead.

53:22.071 --> 53:23.407
Let me go.

53:56.384 --> 53:59.556
Brace yourself.
This can be cold.

53:59.590 --> 54:02.293
You weren't kidding.

54:02.326 --> 54:05.965
I have to say you look
a little bit further along

54:05.997 --> 54:08.334
in this stage of your pregnancy
than you should be.

54:08.368 --> 54:10.103
Could something be wrong?

54:10.136 --> 54:12.907
No, I don't think so.
But we're gonna take a look.

54:12.940 --> 54:15.176
Is it just you today?

54:15.209 --> 54:18.047
Yes, Jeremy, he doesn't
wanna know the sex.

54:18.081 --> 54:20.451
-Well, you know, he could come and...
-it's fine.

54:26.626 --> 54:28.394
Looks like
we're getting some...

54:33.166 --> 54:35.403
What is it?

54:35.437 --> 54:36.906
Doctor, what is it?

55:06.612 --> 55:08.315
<i>Hey, honey, how you doing?</i>

55:10.617 --> 55:12.987
Can you get
me some water?

55:13.019 --> 55:14.089
Yeah, sure.

56:20.577 --> 56:25.485
<i>Howard, I'm gonna show you
these photographs.</i>

56:25.517 --> 56:27.754
<i>I need you to tell me
what you know about them.</i>

56:35.196 --> 56:38.167
<i>Do you recognize
that little boy?</i>

56:38.201 --> 56:41.439
That's me.
Small me.

56:41.471 --> 56:43.241
<i>And the next one.</i>

56:46.312 --> 56:50.518
<i>Where's Francis?
Francis dormyer is missing.</i>

56:50.551 --> 56:52.787
<i>Now when you escaped
from the house...</i>

56:52.820 --> 56:55.557
I wasn't escaping.

56:55.591 --> 56:57.260
<i>What were you doing?</i>

56:57.293 --> 56:58.561
Groceries.

56:58.595 --> 57:01.132
Francis forgot
to feed me again.

57:01.165 --> 57:05.104
He's so busy saving people.
I wasn't escaping.

57:05.137 --> 57:06.773
<i>Okay.</i>

57:06.805 --> 57:09.176
<i>One of the neighbor said
she found you banging</i>

57:09.210 --> 57:12.647
<i>on the barricaded front door,
screaming, "help me.</i>

57:12.680 --> 57:16.651
<i>Help me, I'm trapped.
I'm not a little girl"</i>

57:16.652 --> 57:19.323
yeah, that's one
of Francis' favorite games.

57:19.356 --> 57:23.496
He dresses me like a little girl
and makes me drink his tea.

57:23.528 --> 57:25.398
I hate it.

57:25.430 --> 57:30.405
But he says that the angel
says that I need salvation.

57:30.438 --> 57:32.308
<i>I was right.</i>

57:32.341 --> 57:34.109
<i>Howard, you're safe now.</i>

57:34.142 --> 57:36.612
I was safe before.
Francis takes care of me.

57:36.646 --> 57:38.415
He wants to save me.

57:38.448 --> 57:40.550
You, you and all your people,
you look at him,

57:40.584 --> 57:42.420
what he did,
and you think he's evil.

57:42.454 --> 57:45.692
But he's not.

57:45.725 --> 57:50.632
I once felt like you
that murder is wrong.

57:50.664 --> 57:52.333
I've learned so much.

57:56.372 --> 57:57.840
You... you know what?

57:57.874 --> 57:59.744
You only see things
in one dimension.

57:59.776 --> 58:02.614
Wrong, right, good, evil,
savior, sinner.

58:02.648 --> 58:07.220
I'm sick of it!
What is wrong?

58:07.252 --> 58:08.688
What is evil...

58:17.267 --> 58:21.240
Why is it up to us
to judge good and evil?

58:22.608 --> 58:25.712
We're all of evil origins.

58:25.745 --> 58:28.916
But there is salvation!

58:28.949 --> 58:32.587
If you wanted to understand,
you would, but you won't.

58:32.620 --> 58:36.893
But he knows.
He knows who's righteous.

58:36.925 --> 58:39.963
And he'll come for them
and he will save...

58:42.800 --> 58:45.604
It's my time!

58:45.637 --> 58:48.175
It's finally my turn.

59:00.491 --> 59:01.760
<i>Turn it off.</i>

59:13.308 --> 59:14.810
<i>Are you happy?</i>

59:14.844 --> 59:17.548
-Yes.
-Good.

59:17.581 --> 59:19.850
Rose, there's something
I have to ask.

59:19.884 --> 59:22.655
Really?
What's that?

59:22.688 --> 59:24.289
Rose...

59:24.322 --> 59:25.491
Will you make me...

59:25.524 --> 59:26.993
Make me
the happiest man alive

59:27.026 --> 59:28.862
accept this proposal
and be my wife?

59:28.896 --> 59:31.900
Sorry, I should have
let you do that.

59:31.932 --> 59:35.371
-Maybe you've had enough champagne.
-No...

59:35.404 --> 59:37.941
I'm sorry.
So sorry.

59:37.975 --> 59:39.578
That's okay.

59:39.610 --> 59:41.446
Here.

59:44.783 --> 59:46.620
-Do you love me?
-Yes.

59:46.652 --> 59:47.888
-Say it.
-I love you.

01:00:07.581 --> 01:00:08.817
Doctor?

01:00:16.660 --> 01:00:17.896
<i>Hello?</i>

01:00:21.099 --> 01:00:22.701
Hello?

01:00:24.738 --> 01:00:25.973
Doctor?

01:00:54.577 --> 01:00:55.746
<i>Rose.</i>

01:00:57.814 --> 01:01:00.018
Rose!

01:01:00.050 --> 01:01:02.888
Well?
What do you say?

01:01:02.921 --> 01:01:03.990
What?

01:01:06.125 --> 01:01:08.129
James finds himself
in a room

01:01:08.162 --> 01:01:09.997
submerged in
three feet of water.

01:01:10.030 --> 01:01:11.566
The water is rising.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.669
Three items are
about to be destroyed...

01:01:13.702 --> 01:01:15.872
His pistol,
a picture of his family,

01:01:15.905 --> 01:01:17.441
and a deck of cards.

01:01:17.475 --> 01:01:19.444
-Which one does he choose?
-His pistol.

01:01:19.477 --> 01:01:21.146
Darling.

01:01:21.179 --> 01:01:24.550
You don't know
how happy you've made me.

01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.889
Me, too.

01:01:27.922 --> 01:01:29.591
I'm sorry.
I don't feel good.

01:01:29.624 --> 01:01:31.762
I just...
I think I need... just...

01:01:36.834 --> 01:01:38.870
I can't wait to tell
my parents and your parents.

01:01:38.902 --> 01:01:40.840
We should call them.
Who should we call first?

01:01:40.872 --> 01:01:44.578
Um, I'm... mine.

01:01:44.611 --> 01:01:45.813
How are you feeling?

01:01:45.846 --> 01:01:47.682
Very strange.

01:01:47.715 --> 01:01:49.718
I can't... did i...
Did i...

01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:51.053
Focus!

01:01:51.086 --> 01:01:53.722
This is so exciting!

01:01:53.755 --> 01:01:54.991
Mom?

01:01:57.127 --> 01:02:00.166
Yeah.
I really miss you.

01:02:05.138 --> 01:02:07.476
Please tell dad I'm sorry.

01:02:07.508 --> 01:02:09.445
I will love you always.

01:02:12.949 --> 01:02:14.251
-Ouch.
-Come here.

01:02:20.992 --> 01:02:22.895
I love you.

01:02:22.928 --> 01:02:26.199
Ever since I saw you
in that little blue dress.

01:02:26.233 --> 01:02:29.271
That's the one.

01:02:29.303 --> 01:02:30.739
Pay attention.

01:02:30.772 --> 01:02:34.577
One, two, three,
one, two, three.

01:02:34.611 --> 01:02:36.146
-Do it.
-No.

01:02:36.178 --> 01:02:37.982
-One, two, three.
-Please stop.

01:02:38.016 --> 01:02:40.785
The father enters his house.
The children are playing a game.

01:02:40.818 --> 01:02:42.255
-No!
-What game are they playing?

01:02:42.287 --> 01:02:43.689
-Stop!
-Wrong.

01:02:43.723 --> 01:02:45.827
Three tools hang
in a doorway.

01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:47.695
-A hammer, a saw...
-Stop!

01:04:09.171 --> 01:04:11.041
Hi, Mary?

01:04:11.074 --> 01:04:12.876
Thinner!

01:04:12.909 --> 01:04:14.245
Yes, I'll hold.

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:39.411
Sour!

01:04:39.445 --> 01:04:40.714
Bitter!

01:04:42.381 --> 01:04:43.684
Filler!

01:04:47.055 --> 01:04:49.125
Boner.

01:04:53.731 --> 01:04:57.402
The Millers!

01:04:57.435 --> 01:04:59.072
You wouldn't.

01:05:01.942 --> 01:05:04.746
Liver!

01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.350
Jiggler!

01:05:14.290 --> 01:05:15.859
Hitler!

01:05:19.532 --> 01:05:22.802
Uninformed voter!

01:05:22.835 --> 01:05:25.396
The thing you have to understand
is that China attacked us first.

01:05:32.115 --> 01:05:33.985
Thriller!

01:05:36.187 --> 01:05:38.224
What in the name
of Dumbledore...

01:05:38.257 --> 01:05:40.060
Mother!

01:05:40.093 --> 01:05:41.828
God!

01:05:41.861 --> 01:05:44.398
Swiffer!

01:05:44.431 --> 01:05:45.801
Grindr!

01:05:45.834 --> 01:05:48.370
Hey.

01:05:52.809 --> 01:05:54.946
Potter!

01:05:54.978 --> 01:05:56.147
Gipper!

01:05:59.485 --> 01:06:01.821
Wicker... man.

01:06:15.373 --> 01:06:17.041
Okay, fine.

01:06:17.074 --> 01:06:19.178
I shouldn't have eaten
your macaroni salad.

01:06:19.211 --> 01:06:20.512
I'm sorry.

01:06:20.546 --> 01:06:23.217
And I shouldn't have
overreacted.

01:06:23.250 --> 01:06:25.453
Here, let me
make it up to you.

01:06:25.485 --> 01:06:28.323
Centaur!

01:06:38.302 --> 01:06:39.906
Hello, ladies.

01:06:42.909 --> 01:06:44.344
Thinner.

01:07:18.524 --> 01:07:21.362
Three, two, one.

01:07:23.062 --> 01:07:24.365
You should tuck her
back in this time.

01:07:24.398 --> 01:07:26.668
I really don't think
she wants me to.

01:07:26.701 --> 01:07:28.169
You haven't tried.

01:07:28.203 --> 01:07:29.539
She's been acting
super weird

01:07:29.572 --> 01:07:31.441
since we get back
from the honeymoon.

01:07:31.474 --> 01:07:32.977
Don't call her weird.

01:07:33.009 --> 01:07:34.278
I didn't call her...

01:07:34.312 --> 01:07:36.315
Sorry.

01:07:38.216 --> 01:07:40.386
Hey.
What's up, pumpkin?

01:07:43.123 --> 01:07:45.961
The monster's in my closet.

01:07:45.994 --> 01:07:48.565
Sweetie, you're okay,
it's just a bad dream.

01:07:51.434 --> 01:07:53.971
Galen will check it out
for you, okay?

01:07:54.004 --> 01:07:56.274
I don't want galen.

01:07:56.307 --> 01:07:58.277
I want you.

01:07:58.309 --> 01:08:00.446
Well, we'll go together.

01:08:16.368 --> 01:08:18.270
We're gonna check out your
room and you're gonna see

01:08:18.304 --> 01:08:20.506
it's free of
the boogeyman, okay?

01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:23.109
But he's not
the boogeyman.

01:08:23.144 --> 01:08:28.017
<i>He told me his name
was Mr. Hendrix.</i>

01:08:28.049 --> 01:08:29.452
What did you say?

01:08:29.486 --> 01:08:31.522
He's not the boogeyman,
he's...

01:08:31.554 --> 01:08:33.390
It's Mr. Hendrix!

01:08:33.424 --> 01:08:35.359
Come here, galen.

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:41.336
See?

01:08:46.073 --> 01:08:47.643
See?

01:08:47.675 --> 01:08:49.545
But he only comes out
in the dark.

01:08:49.578 --> 01:08:51.081
Then we can leave
the lights on.

01:08:51.113 --> 01:08:53.417
He told me he wants
my soul.

01:08:53.450 --> 01:08:57.188
Did you fill his head
with this crap?

01:08:57.221 --> 01:09:00.560
Galen, you have school,
and I have work.

01:09:00.593 --> 01:09:02.328
-But...
-No buts!

01:09:02.363 --> 01:09:06.703
You leave this room again,
I'm gonna SWAT your bottom.

01:09:06.736 --> 01:09:11.308
You could have the lights on,
but you've got to stay in bed.

01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:12.710
You understand?

01:09:17.783 --> 01:09:19.520
<i>Baby's afraid of the dark?</i>

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:33.237
You okay?

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:35.674
I thought maybe I...

01:09:35.706 --> 01:09:39.513
Would stay up
with Jordan for a bit.

01:09:39.546 --> 01:09:43.285
Are you okay with that?

01:09:43.318 --> 01:09:44.386
Yeah?

01:09:48.224 --> 01:09:50.560
All right,
I'll leave you two to it.

01:09:58.637 --> 01:10:00.541
He comes out of the closet,
doesn't he?

01:10:03.445 --> 01:10:05.782
You believe me?

01:10:05.814 --> 01:10:07.483
Nobody believed
me either.

01:10:08.918 --> 01:10:11.789
Who did you tell?

01:10:11.823 --> 01:10:13.758
My dad.

01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:18.364
My mom died before I was
really old enough to remember.

01:10:18.398 --> 01:10:20.835
I don't remember my dad.

01:10:20.868 --> 01:10:23.238
Yeah, well, mine didn't exactly
stick around long enough

01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:24.339
to leave me any memories.

01:10:26.642 --> 01:10:31.414
Did Mr. Hendrix
say anything to you?

01:10:31.447 --> 01:10:34.652
He told me he was gonna
take my soul.

01:10:34.685 --> 01:10:37.157
He told me that.

01:10:37.190 --> 01:10:39.426
I am not gonna
let him hurt you.

01:10:39.459 --> 01:10:42.664
Do you understand me?
Besides I think you're okay.

01:10:42.696 --> 01:10:45.934
It's not really you he wants.
I think it's me.

01:10:45.968 --> 01:10:49.172
I know.
He told me that, too.

01:10:49.206 --> 01:10:52.677
<i>Bye, galen.</i>

01:12:29.106 --> 01:12:30.375
Hello?

01:12:43.492 --> 01:12:44.827
Hello?

01:13:27.885 --> 01:13:30.621
I see you met Hank.

01:13:30.655 --> 01:13:34.060
That's what I call him.
A little less creepy that way.

01:13:34.093 --> 01:13:35.596
Yeah.

01:13:35.629 --> 01:13:37.163
I'm so sorry about that.

01:13:37.197 --> 01:13:39.501
We were in the studio
we couldn't hear a thing.

01:13:39.533 --> 01:13:41.836
I'm Karen.
I'm Oscar's camera assistant.

01:13:41.869 --> 01:13:44.807
Allie, it's literally okay.
I just got here.

01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:46.709
Plus I had Hank
to keep me company.

01:13:46.742 --> 01:13:48.412
Yeah, well...

01:13:48.446 --> 01:13:52.818
He's collected a lot of
weird stuff over the years.

01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:55.555
Let me get your bag.
The studio's out back.

01:13:55.587 --> 01:13:56.723
Okay. Thanks.

01:13:58.758 --> 01:14:01.729
<i>Allie, this is Henry.
Don't mind Henry.</i>

01:14:01.763 --> 01:14:04.567
I'm Henry.
Don't mind me.

01:14:04.599 --> 01:14:08.038
<i>-Allie.
-Mr. conley.</i>

01:14:08.071 --> 01:14:11.142
Can I just say what...
It is such an honor

01:14:11.175 --> 01:14:15.482
-to be working with you...
-No, the honor is mine.

01:14:15.514 --> 01:14:17.717
It was those eyes, you have
a wonderful naturalism.

01:14:19.252 --> 01:14:20.955
I was thinking you
and I can do some really,

01:14:20.989 --> 01:14:22.926
really cool together
for this campaign.

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:24.227
How's that sound?

01:14:24.259 --> 01:14:25.963
That sounds amazing.

01:14:25.996 --> 01:14:27.832
That sounds amazing.

01:14:27.865 --> 01:14:29.835
Yes, it does.

01:14:29.867 --> 01:14:33.038
Well, why don't you head over
to hair and makeup,

01:14:33.072 --> 01:14:34.708
and I will see you soon?

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:36.476
Okay.

01:14:36.509 --> 01:14:37.711
Karen?

01:14:40.080 --> 01:14:42.084
<i>Right this way.</i>

01:15:06.616 --> 01:15:08.253
As I said...

01:15:08.286 --> 01:15:10.055
The honor's mine.

01:15:12.291 --> 01:15:15.160
Shall we?

01:15:15.194 --> 01:15:16.965
I'm a little nervous.

01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.702
You know, the native people
used to believe

01:15:20.735 --> 01:15:23.805
the camera steals the soul,
but I think the only thing you

01:15:23.839 --> 01:15:27.211
have to worry about is keeping
those spaghetti straps on.

01:15:27.243 --> 01:15:29.814
Um, do you want me
to just...

01:15:29.847 --> 01:15:31.217
No, no, no,
I don't want anything from you.

01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:34.588
I mean, rather...
I do but...

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.564
It's nothing you should have
on your mind.

01:15:41.596 --> 01:15:43.766
Just...

01:15:43.799 --> 01:15:45.903
Just be you.

01:15:47.638 --> 01:15:48.908
I can do that.

01:15:55.348 --> 01:15:56.784
<i>That's nice.</i>

01:16:20.715 --> 01:16:22.218
<i>I think we got it.</i>

01:16:22.250 --> 01:16:23.886
<i>Really?
Are you happy?</i>

01:16:23.918 --> 01:16:25.688
Are you?

01:16:25.722 --> 01:16:29.693
My soul
feels enriched.

01:16:29.727 --> 01:16:32.030
Good, good.

01:16:32.064 --> 01:16:33.767
Well, if you want
to get cleaned up,

01:16:33.799 --> 01:16:35.202
Karen can
help you with that.

01:16:35.235 --> 01:16:38.907
Just, just come back and
say goodbye before you go.

01:16:38.939 --> 01:16:40.910
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:16:43.145 --> 01:16:45.082
I'll see you in a few.

01:16:47.150 --> 01:16:50.822
Allie, um... do...

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:55.129
Do you mind if i...

01:16:55.162 --> 01:16:57.065
Do you mind if I snap
one more picture...

01:16:57.097 --> 01:17:00.703
<i>For my private collection?</i>

01:17:00.735 --> 01:17:02.171
Of course.

01:17:02.204 --> 01:17:06.344
Um, same spot?
Do you want me to do anything?

01:17:06.376 --> 01:17:08.781
No, don't...

01:17:08.814 --> 01:17:12.185
Don't change anything,
yeah, yeah.

01:17:12.217 --> 01:17:13.854
Same spot's good.

01:17:39.154 --> 01:17:40.924
Wow.

01:17:40.956 --> 01:17:43.960
That's an incredible
looking camera.

01:17:43.994 --> 01:17:46.397
I've never seen one like it.
Where did you find that?

01:17:49.099 --> 01:17:52.104
A,
Friend gave it to me.

01:17:52.137 --> 01:17:55.176
<i>It takes a very special
kind of picture.</i>

01:17:57.844 --> 01:17:59.365
They don't make them
like this anymore.

01:18:02.051 --> 01:18:05.890
Now just...

01:18:05.922 --> 01:18:06.990
Be you.
