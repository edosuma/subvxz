[rumbling]

00:58.728 --> 01:02.600
<i>Warning...
the planet biot is off-limits.</i>

01:02.667 --> 01:06.702
<i>Retreat, or face annihilation.</i>

01:31.900 --> 01:37.040
Soon you will serve me.
All of you will.

01:38.209 --> 01:40.378
[pulsating]

01:42.214 --> 01:44.683
[pulsating continues]

02:01.568 --> 02:05.237
Carol?
Hal! Oh!

02:05.305 --> 02:07.172
Thank heavens you're ok!

02:07.240 --> 02:09.441
Mmm.

02:09.508 --> 02:12.877
It's over. We stopped
the Red Lantern invasion.

02:12.945 --> 02:14.479
We won.

02:14.546 --> 02:15.980
I knew you'd save the galaxy.

02:16.048 --> 02:19.384
I just...I didn't know
if you'd make it back.

02:19.452 --> 02:21.653
I know this must have been
hard on you.

02:21.721 --> 02:25.056
But I want to make up for it.
Can we pick up where we left off?

02:25.124 --> 02:27.092
Is that possible after
everything that's happened?

02:27.159 --> 02:29.494
We can't just pretend it's all the same.

02:29.562 --> 02:31.998
Well, we just need a little time
to get things back to normal.

02:32.065 --> 02:33.399
With us. Together.

02:33.467 --> 02:36.669
Now where's that flight log?
I'm ready to get back to work.

02:36.737 --> 02:41.241
Oh. About that.
You were gone a long time.

02:41.309 --> 02:43.877
And these planes weren't
going to fly themselves.

02:46.047 --> 02:48.015
You hired a replacement?

02:48.083 --> 02:51.018
As much as I care for you,
Hal, I've got a business to run.

02:51.086 --> 02:56.258
Ok, point taken. Next time
I'll put in a vacation request.

02:56.325 --> 02:59.428
Vacation? Hal, you
disappeared for months.

02:59.496 --> 03:03.332
I thought you were dead!
There can't be a next time.

03:03.400 --> 03:07.704
Carol, you know I can't promise that.
But I swear, it'll be different.

03:07.771 --> 03:10.106
From now on, I won't go for so long.

03:10.174 --> 03:12.042
You can't control the universe, Hal.

03:12.109 --> 03:15.412
What if your next mission
takes a year? Or five?

03:15.480 --> 03:17.781
Or what if you don't come back at all?

03:17.849 --> 03:20.217
<i>We're live from the
scene of the disaster</i>

03:20.285 --> 03:22.019
<i>as a broken crane has
turned this construction site</i>

03:22.087 --> 03:24.555
<i>into a veritable tower of terror.</i>

03:25.424 --> 03:28.059
Carol, I should hand... go.

03:28.126 --> 03:30.361
They need you.

03:32.164 --> 03:35.532
We'll continue this
discussion over dinner.

03:35.600 --> 03:40.138
- 5:00, Chez Nous?
 - Fine. I'll be there. But will you?

03:57.859 --> 03:59.326
Whoa!

03:59.394 --> 04:01.429
[crowd yelling]

04:04.199 --> 04:08.103
What's that? Whoa!

04:09.605 --> 04:13.374
<i>Ahh! No!</i>

04:14.777 --> 04:17.545
[gasping]

04:27.557 --> 04:30.092
Gotcha!

04:31.762 --> 04:35.098
I got this one, buddy.

04:49.313 --> 04:51.647
[crowd cheering]

04:56.319 --> 04:59.856
Please, it was nothing.

05:01.124 --> 05:04.289
[cheering continues]

05:04.356 --> 05:06.784
Once again, Guy Gardener,
the ginger Green Lantern,

05:06.852 --> 05:11.285
saves the day with an assist
from some other Green Lantern.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.754
Some other? You really
should check your facts.

05:13.821 --> 05:16.523
I am the only Green Lantern of...
unhh!

05:16.590 --> 05:19.459
Green Lantern of unhh?
Hey, better get back there.

05:19.526 --> 05:23.696
As for Earth, when trouble calls, 
Guy Gardener picks up.

05:23.763 --> 05:25.131
Stay cool, Hal.

05:25.198 --> 05:28.267
I'm sure there's a perfectly
logical explanation.

05:28.335 --> 05:30.836
So, you want an autograph?

05:30.903 --> 05:36.307
Mr. Gardener, I'm a reporter!
That's Vinessa, with an "I".

05:36.375 --> 05:39.309
My cell number's on there, too.

05:39.377 --> 05:44.481
Hey. Just wanted to say nice work.
You did a great job out there.

05:44.549 --> 05:46.483
Sorry, pal, the autograph 
shack is closed.

05:46.551 --> 05:49.286
- Can't risk a hand cramp.
- Do I look like a fan?

05:49.353 --> 05:52.656
Halloween costume, weird, tiny mask...

05:52.723 --> 05:54.958
Yeah. Yeah, you do.

05:56.494 --> 06:00.097
Neat, your ring glows
just like a real... oh-ho.

06:00.165 --> 06:02.266
You must be that last
Green Lantern we had,

06:02.334 --> 06:04.735
the one who left the
planet high and dry.

06:04.803 --> 06:09.073
I was busy saving the Universe.
You know, Red Lantern invasion?

06:09.141 --> 06:11.643
Hmm. No, doesn't ring any bells.

06:11.711 --> 06:13.779
Ah, that's ok.

06:13.846 --> 06:15.280
Guess I should have known
the Guardians would send

06:15.348 --> 06:17.416
a temp to cover for me 
while I was away.

06:17.483 --> 06:20.318
Cover? Nuh-uh. 
You've been replaced.

06:20.386 --> 06:22.487
Guardians didn't tell you?
 It's typical.

06:22.555 --> 06:26.424
Can we ever really trust
those little blue jerks?

06:26.492 --> 06:28.426
Don't get me started.

06:28.494 --> 06:31.662
You got a name, or does the tiny
mask prevent you from telling me?

06:31.730 --> 06:33.831
Jordan. Hal Jordan.

06:33.898 --> 06:35.499
Seems like we have some
official Green Lantern

06:35.567 --> 06:38.335
catching up to do. 
You like hot wings?

06:38.403 --> 06:40.704
Matter of fact, I do.

06:40.772 --> 06:43.440
[wind blowing]

06:45.944 --> 06:49.714
<i>Remarkable.
Astounding.</i>

06:49.781 --> 06:51.649
Definitely Antediluvian.

06:51.717 --> 06:55.786
Unlike any civilization
known by modern archaeology.

06:55.854 --> 06:58.222
[pulsating]

07:11.036 --> 07:12.870
<i>Aaah!</i>

07:15.630 --> 07:19.800
I can't believe it.
Fired twice in one day.

07:19.868 --> 07:22.269
Really?
 What was your day job?

07:22.337 --> 07:24.205
Test pilot at Ferris Air.

07:24.272 --> 07:26.340
Things get a little complicated
when you're dating the boss.

07:26.408 --> 07:29.076
There's your problem...
dating, relationships.

07:29.144 --> 07:31.279
No one gets hurt when
you're a one man band.

07:31.346 --> 07:35.750
- No strings equals no problems.
- You'd make a good guardian, guy.

07:35.818 --> 07:38.619
Yeah, a zillion years old
with zero social skills.

07:38.687 --> 07:41.621
You should call them and tell
them off. Someone needs to.

07:41.689 --> 07:45.558
- You know what, I think I will.
- That's the spirit!

07:45.626 --> 07:49.495
Green Lantern of sector 2814,
calling the Guardians, come in.

07:49.563 --> 07:53.231
<i>We are very busy at the moment.
What is the purpose of this call?</i>

07:53.299 --> 07:55.000
The purpose? 
I'll tell you the purpose.

07:55.068 --> 07:58.270
You've got a lot of nerve
loaning my sector to a new...

07:58.338 --> 08:01.506
<i>Is that Guy Gardener? 
How are you, Guy?</i>

08:01.574 --> 08:04.643
- Doin' great, Abster.
- Abster?

08:04.711 --> 08:06.912
<i>Wonderful to hear from you, Guy.</i>

08:06.980 --> 08:09.348
<i>Unfortunately, it is
chaos at the moment,</i>

08:09.416 --> 08:11.584
<i>but later this week, a few
of us are tasting delicacies</i>

08:11.652 --> 08:13.386
<i>from far away quadrants.</i>

08:13.454 --> 08:18.025
<i>Perhaps you'd find it interesting.
I'll have an invitation sent.</i>

08:18.093 --> 08:21.695
Mmm. [burps]

08:21.763 --> 08:25.065
This is unreal. What the heck
happened while I was gone?

08:25.133 --> 08:29.036
Ohh, it's been fun.
I got to run. Thanks for the wings.

08:29.104 --> 08:31.205
Hold on, I'm not finished with you yet.

08:31.272 --> 08:33.407
We still need to sort
out whose sector this is.

08:33.475 --> 08:35.542
Seeing as I'm the Green
Lantern and you're not,

08:35.610 --> 08:38.212
I'd say this is my turf.

08:39.547 --> 08:41.313
Ugh!

08:41.381 --> 08:44.951
Look, don't make me take that
ring and jam it up your nose.

08:45.019 --> 08:47.720
Ughh!

08:47.788 --> 08:50.757
Well, that, I'd like to see.

09:01.061 --> 09:03.128
Face it, Jordan. I'm the
Green Lantern of Earth now 

09:03.196 --> 09:08.200
- and there's nothing you can do about it!
- I wouldn't say "nothing".

09:08.268 --> 09:10.269
Unhh!

09:13.741 --> 09:16.276
[both grunting]

09:22.950 --> 09:24.884
[groans]

09:27.388 --> 09:30.990
Hey, Jordan. How about
rock, paper, scissors?

09:31.058 --> 09:34.294
Loser has to leave
the sector... for good!

09:36.130 --> 09:37.897
[gasps]

09:37.965 --> 09:40.533
[both grunting]

09:53.781 --> 09:56.016
[tires squealing]

09:57.952 --> 10:00.020
<i>This is Vinessa Swelter</i>

10:00.087 --> 10:02.689
<i>reporting live from
Tegra glacier, California.</i>

10:02.757 --> 10:04.958
Wow, that lady really gets around.

10:05.026 --> 10:08.095
<i>Massive amounts of what eyewitnesses
describe as "unearthly energy"</i>

10:08.162 --> 10:11.298
<i>coincided with the disappearance
of professor Noam Chilton,</i>

10:11.365 --> 10:13.366
<i>who had recently rocked
the scientific world</i>

10:13.434 --> 10:16.402
<i>with his discovery of a
mysterious ancient tomb.</i>

10:16.470 --> 10:18.704
Let's shelve this for now
while I check that out...

10:18.772 --> 10:21.841
Boy, I really dislike that guy.

10:28.948 --> 10:31.750
What are you waiting for? 
Afraid of the dark?

10:31.818 --> 10:33.686
Hey, it's my little sidekick.

10:33.753 --> 10:36.055
Stay outside.
I'll call you if I need you.

10:36.122 --> 10:39.325
At never o'clock!

10:50.238 --> 10:52.438
What's a weird place like this
doing in the middle of no...

10:52.506 --> 10:55.207
[rumbling]

10:58.846 --> 11:03.082
- Thanks.
- Saving helpless civilians is what I do.

11:03.150 --> 11:06.419
- Who you calling a civilian?
- You going to do something about...

11:06.486 --> 11:09.055
Shh. You hear that?

11:15.695 --> 11:20.032
Professor? You in here?

11:27.206 --> 11:29.975
I don't think he can hear you.

11:33.879 --> 11:37.716
Look at these markings.
Translation.

11:37.784 --> 11:42.855
"No man escapes the Manhunters".

11:47.194 --> 11:50.296
Manhunters. Where have
I heard that before?

11:50.364 --> 11:52.031
That Red Lantern invasion I stopped

11:52.099 --> 11:54.534
while you were here on Earth
and not helping in any way

11:54.602 --> 11:58.338
- was incited by those things.
- What are they, robots?

11:58.405 --> 12:00.973
They were the forerunners
to the Green Lantern core.

12:01.041 --> 12:04.176
Their prime directive was to hunt
and destroy the criminal element.

12:04.244 --> 12:07.813
Somehow they decided that included
all life forms with emotions.

12:07.881 --> 12:10.349
They wiped out an entire sector.

12:11.651 --> 12:13.552
[indistinct yelling]

12:17.456 --> 12:20.391
Might want to try going
on offense there, buddy.

12:20.459 --> 12:23.895
Easy for you to say...
I've got two of 'em!

12:26.932 --> 12:28.766
[grunts]

12:28.834 --> 12:32.370
I'm open to suggestions...
even from you.

12:45.916 --> 12:48.485
Follow me!

12:55.159 --> 12:57.761
[crash]

13:24.657 --> 13:27.025
Good plan. 
Glad I thought of it.

13:28.394 --> 13:32.130
Green Lantern of sector 2814
calling senior intelligence analyst.

13:32.198 --> 13:34.233
Salaak, would you please tell me

13:34.300 --> 13:37.269
what dormant Manhunters
are doing here on Earth?

13:37.337 --> 13:39.170
<i>As you well know, Hal Jordan,</i>

13:39.238 --> 13:42.107
<i>all Manhunters were
decommissioned eons ago.</i>

13:42.174 --> 13:45.443
<i>Is this an example of your
Earth humor? I do not get it.</i>

13:45.511 --> 13:47.245
No, Salaak, these things are here.

13:47.313 --> 13:49.480
I just saw three of
them with my own eyes.

13:49.548 --> 13:53.785
<i>It cannot be. But if were
and you failed to stop them,</i>

13:53.853 --> 13:57.989
<i>they would exterminate ever
sentient being they could find.</i>

13:58.057 --> 14:00.858
Then let's hope we crushed 'em.

14:00.926 --> 14:03.427
<i>Say, is that Guy Gardener?</i>

14:04.863 --> 14:07.398
[helicopter]

14:13.439 --> 14:16.541
What happened inside that tomb?

14:16.609 --> 14:19.211
What else? Guy Gardner
stopped some evil robots...

14:19.278 --> 14:21.813
Luckily, the real Green Lantern of Earth

14:21.881 --> 14:23.649
managed to squelch a major threat

14:23.717 --> 14:28.721
with some minor assistance from
my sidekick here... carrot top.

14:31.558 --> 14:33.125
What is that?

14:33.193 --> 14:35.694
[rumbling]

14:38.631 --> 14:40.698
Nothing you want to be
around for, so take cover.

14:40.766 --> 14:41.800
Guy, get ready.

14:41.867 --> 14:44.903
Steve, roll camera.

14:51.543 --> 14:53.978
<i>Emotions detected.</i>

15:00.274 --> 15:03.777
Get out of here, now! 
We'll hold them off. 

15:03.845 --> 15:06.147
Nothing I can't handle, baby.

15:12.822 --> 15:14.989
[grunting]

15:19.061 --> 15:22.596
This footage is my ticket to
an anchor desk. Get closer!

15:52.493 --> 15:55.462
Hey, Vinessa, check it out.

16:01.203 --> 16:03.304
That's how I roll. 
Ahh!

16:12.915 --> 16:16.685
<i>Emotions detected.</i>

16:17.720 --> 16:19.856
[gasps]

16:19.923 --> 16:21.658
Ah! Ah!

16:21.725 --> 16:24.828
[groaning]

16:24.896 --> 16:29.066
[grunting]

16:33.905 --> 16:38.242
Get away as fast as you can! 
Ahh!

16:39.377 --> 16:41.712
[grunting]

16:49.755 --> 16:52.123
[beeping]

16:53.485 --> 16:55.159
<i>Emotions detected.</i>

16:58.430 --> 17:01.600
[grunting]

17:04.069 --> 17:07.271
We can't let them reach that town!

17:25.124 --> 17:26.692
Let's give 'em the old blindside blitz

17:26.759 --> 17:29.261
like I used to use back in Ann Arbor.

17:36.669 --> 17:39.404
Not bad. 
Did you play any ball?

17:39.472 --> 17:42.007
Baseball, mostly.

17:50.449 --> 17:53.217
[sizzling]

17:53.285 --> 17:57.188
- Ah, tough sport.
- Tough enough for a jet pilot.

17:57.255 --> 17:59.457
- Oh, yeah! 
- Ha ha, yeah!

17:59.524 --> 18:02.793
Finally! I can never get
a fist bump out there.

18:02.861 --> 18:04.962
I know, right? Thousands
of species in the core

18:05.030 --> 18:06.797
and we're the only ones
 who fist bump.

18:06.865 --> 18:09.701
We Earth Lanterns got watch
each other's backs, right?

18:09.768 --> 18:11.703
You bet, pal.

18:11.771 --> 18:14.105
[helicopter]

18:16.809 --> 18:20.145
Uh, Guy...

18:20.213 --> 18:22.581
[wind blowing]

18:25.451 --> 18:29.087
Damage is minimal. 
You're good to fly.

18:29.155 --> 18:30.956
Thank you, Green Lanterns.

18:31.023 --> 18:32.891
- You're welcome.
- You're welcome.

18:32.958 --> 18:36.027
[helicopter engine whirring]

18:37.530 --> 18:39.764
[cell phone rings]

18:39.832 --> 18:42.667
[ring] 
Cell phone.

18:43.735 --> 18:45.737
[ring] 
Oh, shoot!

18:45.805 --> 18:47.605
What time is it? 
No, no!

18:47.673 --> 18:50.408
Carol. Hi. 
I'm sorry I'm late,

18:50.476 --> 18:52.643
but I'm on my way, and...

18:52.711 --> 18:54.979
<i>Wait, Hal, we need to talk.</i>

18:55.046 --> 18:57.948
- Oh, that's never good.
- Is someone else with you?

18:58.016 --> 19:01.452
Do you mind? 
Carol, heh, I can explain.

19:01.519 --> 19:03.487
<i>Hal, no more explanations.</i>

19:03.555 --> 19:05.555
<i>No more excuses, no more hoping</i>

19:05.623 --> 19:09.392
<i>and wishing for a future that's
just not in the cards for us.</i>

19:09.459 --> 19:11.761
Carol, I'm really trying.

19:11.828 --> 19:14.664
<i>Hal!
I don't want you to have to try.</i>

19:14.732 --> 19:17.867
<i>I want you to live the
life you were meant for.</i>

19:17.934 --> 19:20.269
<i>This is bigger than us.</i>

19:20.337 --> 19:22.972
<i>You have a calling, and I will
not ask you to give that up.</i>

19:23.040 --> 19:25.942
- And if I did?
- Oh, that's sweet.

19:26.010 --> 19:30.447
<i>But it's better for both of us
if we just move on with our lives.</i>

19:30.514 --> 19:32.015
Don't say that. 
We can make it work...

19:32.083 --> 19:36.319
<i>Bye, Hal.
Sorry.</i>

19:36.387 --> 19:38.555
At least she didn't say
she wants to be friends.

19:38.623 --> 19:40.324
Don't start, Gardener.

19:40.392 --> 19:42.793
I'm not, buddy. I know exactly
what you're going through.

19:42.861 --> 19:44.495
I really doubt that.

19:44.563 --> 19:47.464
[chuckles] What?
You think I don't know what it's like?

19:47.532 --> 19:50.835
We're on call 24/7, busting
our humps to save lives,

19:50.903 --> 19:54.405
but when it comes to having a life?
Making connections?

19:54.473 --> 19:57.775
Oh, there's not enough time in the day.
That's the truth.

19:57.843 --> 19:59.377
At least you've got
people who care about you.

19:59.445 --> 20:01.512
If I left Earth, 
who would even notice?

20:01.580 --> 20:03.982
You always got your fans.

20:04.049 --> 20:07.985
Everyone loves a hero, right?
But only in theory.

20:08.053 --> 20:11.055
Careful, Guy. 
You almost sound human.

20:12.258 --> 20:15.693
So... 
think I could get Carol's number?

20:15.761 --> 20:17.929
She seems really nice and I think
she was checking me out on the phone.

20:17.997 --> 20:21.232
Seeing as you guys
are split up... [grunts]

20:21.300 --> 20:24.403
[cell phone rings]

20:24.470 --> 20:25.904
<i>Hal Jordan,</i>

20:25.972 --> 20:28.106
<i>you are to report to the
Guardian chamber at once.</i>

20:28.174 --> 20:33.478
[sighs] Hey.
Put in a good word for me?

20:38.351 --> 20:41.887
Hal Jordan, it is the
decision of this council

20:41.955 --> 20:44.222
that you be immediately
removed from duty

20:44.290 --> 20:47.092
as Green Lantern of sector 2814,

20:47.160 --> 20:49.194
and be replaced by Guy Gardener.

20:49.262 --> 20:51.063
Thanks. 
I already got that message.

20:51.130 --> 20:52.964
But I've got a message for you...

20:53.032 --> 20:57.702
I don't need this, so you can take your
power ring, and stick it straight up...

20:57.770 --> 21:00.104
You misunderstand. 
Allow me to finish.

21:00.172 --> 21:05.043
Your bravery in defeating the Red
Lanterns has not gone unnoticed.

21:05.111 --> 21:07.278
Not sure where this is going...

21:07.346 --> 21:11.882
A Lantern of your caliber is underutilized
working in only a single sector.

21:11.950 --> 21:16.487
Henceforth, you shall
patrol all of Guardian space.

21:16.555 --> 21:20.391
- Wait, so I'm not being fired?
- Indeed not.

21:20.459 --> 21:23.127
Congratulations, Hal Jordan.

21:23.195 --> 21:28.066
You have been promoted to 
Honor Guard of the Green Lantern core.
