03:30.042 --> 03:31.332
Open up.

03:33.083 --> 03:34.082
Hold on.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.082
Stop it,
we'll get this over with faster.

03:46.875 --> 03:49.249
- Give him a break, please.
- I have to do this.

03:49.458 --> 03:51.374
Leave him alone.
Stefan!

03:53.375 --> 03:54.166
At three.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.791
- One, two... three.
- You're stupid!

03:58.333 --> 04:00.166
Madam, it's over.

04:03.958 --> 04:05.166
My dearest Lady Macbeth,

04:05.333 --> 04:08.041
this show is really poor...

04:08.500 --> 04:10.291
In fact it's mediocre.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.166
Mum!

04:30.750 --> 04:32.457
What are you doing up so early?

04:34.833 --> 04:36.749
Take this to 'The Actresses'
in Mazowiecka Street.

04:36.875 --> 04:39.124
Tell them it's for Ariadna...
Please...

04:39.292 --> 04:40.666
Don't stop, get moving!

04:41.250 --> 04:43.874
Morning, boss!
Boss!

04:45.000 --> 04:47.041
- Women! Devils incarnate!
- Right!

04:47.250 --> 04:50.874
- Will you spare a fiver, boss...?
- I have nothing, chief.

04:53.250 --> 04:55.749
Leave him alone.
We'll lose her.

06:19.792 --> 06:21.457
Citizens of Warsaw!

06:23.167 --> 06:28.874
All acts of disobedience against
the German authorities will be punished.

06:29.500 --> 06:34.541
That's why today we will execute
another 40 people

06:35.042 --> 06:38.374
who were recently pardoned.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.499
Get moving!

06:42.875 --> 06:46.791
- Which crates stay, which ones go?
- Get to work, Stefan!

06:47.000 --> 06:50.499
- Watch what you're doing!
- These go, those stay.

06:51.292 --> 06:54.499
- So you want to be the chairman?
- That's right, your deputy!

06:55.792 --> 06:58.291
- He wants to be the chairman!
- Girls!

07:16.250 --> 07:22.041
Young man! Come here!
Put these in the car.

07:30.333 --> 07:33.541
- In the car.
- I don't understand.

07:33.750 --> 07:37.624
I'm sorry, sir!
The boy probably didn't understand you.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.749
Get this out of here.

07:42.375 --> 07:46.499
- Your men aren't overexerting themselves.
- He's new.

07:47.625 --> 07:52.082
- What a great day today!
- Great days are long gone.

07:58.750 --> 08:00.541
Don't you dare scratch anything!

08:00.833 --> 08:01.749
Hermann!

08:15.250 --> 08:16.666
Is he legally employed?

08:17.167 --> 08:19.041
They're all legal at my factory.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.166
You hire some pretty defiant characters.

08:23.375 --> 08:24.999
Your papers.

08:40.542 --> 08:43.249
Just look at that expression on his face!

08:43.500 --> 08:47.249
Where do you pigs get
all that hostility?

08:48.583 --> 08:52.041
You understand
every single word I say, don't you?

08:54.542 --> 08:57.749
Is this how much you want us
to leave your city?

09:02.125 --> 09:02.832
No problem.

09:05.333 --> 09:09.249
It's just that when we go,
we'll be replaced by communists from Russia.

09:09.375 --> 09:11.249
And then you'll beg us to come back.

09:11.792 --> 09:15.166
You can always count on me, miss.
Goodbye!

09:17.000 --> 09:18.749
- Dad!
- When are you finishing?

09:18.958 --> 09:20.749
- I'm coming!
- We're waiting and waiting.

09:24.792 --> 09:26.582
I don't know where you got it
and what it's for.

09:26.750 --> 09:29.624
I'm not going to inform on you
but I don't want to see you again.

09:31.292 --> 09:32.957
Take your rubbish and get out.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.582
We'll take care of it.
Don't try to play hero.

09:39.750 --> 09:42.749
We'll get you new papers and a job.
We'll help you out.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.666
I'll manage, thanks.

09:44.833 --> 09:47.749
- How exactly will you do that?
- Don't worry.

09:48.042 --> 09:50.874
Without papers they'll send you
to a labour camp in Germany.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.332
- Maybe.
- I know it's my fault.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.124
Ha, I've seen everything!

09:55.500 --> 09:57.499
There's nothing to see...
We were just...

09:58.000 --> 10:00.874
'We were just'!
And then suddenly there's kids.

10:01.042 --> 10:04.957
- Have you seen them?
- Keep on playing!

10:08.667 --> 10:11.249
- Jasio!
- Don't tell your mum anything.

10:11.583 --> 10:12.957
Leave for work as usual.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.541
Jasio!

10:20.542 --> 10:22.249
Thank you.

10:32.125 --> 10:37.541
So I'm walking and a few thugs come up
to steal my wallet.

10:37.750 --> 10:41.249
And one of them had a knife.
Hence the cut.

10:41.500 --> 10:45.249
Can I have a cut like that?
Please!

10:46.500 --> 10:49.791
- Really? Like this?
- Yes!

10:50.000 --> 10:52.291
Here you go.
The other cheek.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.249
- How do I look?
- Like me.

10:55.500 --> 10:58.291
-Cool...
- Get up.

11:00.083 --> 11:01.082
Fast.

11:04.750 --> 11:09.749
Mum, thugs've cut Stefan's cheek!

11:11.833 --> 11:14.291
Luckily just the cheek.

11:14.500 --> 11:17.124
Mum, you've ruined my tower!

11:19.583 --> 11:20.957
Put that on.

11:23.583 --> 11:27.624
Don't come round here again,
stop bothering people!

11:27.792 --> 11:31.999
Why don't you cut that out
or you'll lose face!

11:32.500 --> 11:34.541
Spare a fiver, boss?

12:00.583 --> 12:01.291
Hi!

12:03.583 --> 12:06.957
- So, how's things?
- Here I am! Where are we going?

12:07.083 --> 12:08.999
Wow, how direct!
On a trip!

12:12.500 --> 12:16.041
- Look where you're going, you idiot!
- At one desk!

12:16.250 --> 12:18.249
- The wimp kept taking my stuff!
- I remember that!

12:19.000 --> 12:22.499
He crapped in his pants
and put the stuff in my satchel!

12:22.625 --> 12:26.041
- Don't tell her!
- His mum had to apologise to my parents.

12:26.250 --> 12:28.499
She invited them
to the theatre she was in

12:28.667 --> 12:31.749
and the play was awful,
my parents left in the middle.

12:31.958 --> 12:36.082
- The director was an idiot.
- Turn here!

12:36.333 --> 12:39.666
I'm sure your mum is a great person...

12:40.500 --> 12:41.874
I'm so happy!

12:42.042 --> 12:45.291
And I've been wondering
what was going on with you.

12:45.500 --> 12:48.749
Someone said you're working,
or you'd left.

12:48.875 --> 12:51.291
And here you are!
The underground is so much fun!

12:51.500 --> 12:52.957
- We've got the best girls.
- Wladek!

12:53.083 --> 12:57.124
What? You know what my nickname is?
Crybaby! Cool, huh?

12:57.292 --> 12:59.499
You idiot, he's not conspiring...

13:00.750 --> 13:04.457
- Oh! You're not?
- No, I'm not.

13:04.625 --> 13:06.624
- So what will you be doing?
- Well?

13:06.792 --> 13:08.082
- Depends.
- On what?

13:08.583 --> 13:10.749
- On chance!
- I won't take chances.

13:10.875 --> 13:13.332
I need papers, a job -
some peace and quiet.

13:13.750 --> 13:18.749
- Hi, this is your Coco Chanel outfit.
- Hi Crybaby!

13:19.042 --> 13:22.499
You've met Rogal.
I'll show you everything.

13:23.125 --> 13:25.749
- Instruct him.
- Yes, sir!

13:26.500 --> 13:28.374
Well, well...

13:29.292 --> 13:32.041
The bucket is under the sink,
and there's water in the tap.

13:34.042 --> 13:34.999
The brush!

13:57.000 --> 14:00.249
- Hello, gentlemen!
- Good morning!

14:01.375 --> 14:04.332
Guys, let's unload the crates.

14:04.958 --> 14:06.541
To the office.

14:06.750 --> 14:08.541
- That's the last shipment.
- What?

14:08.750 --> 14:10.249
Let me go first.

14:10.458 --> 14:11.749
Careful.

14:13.250 --> 14:15.082
Easy with that, please!

15:24.958 --> 15:27.749
Ala! Come back!

15:31.250 --> 15:33.124
Ala!

15:34.375 --> 15:36.749
- Here!
- Ala, come back!

15:38.250 --> 15:43.082
- Come back!
- Ala!

15:44.542 --> 15:48.082
- Are we coming back?
- I'm staying. Forever.

15:48.375 --> 15:49.874
Ala's staying forever.

15:50.667 --> 15:52.999
My sister -
we're teaching her to swim.

15:53.250 --> 15:56.249
- For now, we teach, you watch.
- Morning.

15:57.042 --> 15:58.041
Morning.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.624
Someone has to get her back.

16:00.792 --> 16:03.249
- She won't do it on her own.
- Aleksander, go get your sister!

16:03.458 --> 16:04.791
- I can't, my arm hurts.
- Your arm?

16:05.542 --> 16:07.457
- Crybaby!
- I'm busy on holiday.

16:07.583 --> 16:09.499
- So we aren't coming back?
- Change of plans.

16:09.750 --> 16:12.749
- Rogal will get her.
- No, Stefan!

16:12.958 --> 16:15.041
- He's a better candidate.
- Stefan will!

16:15.250 --> 16:16.291
That's right!

16:16.500 --> 16:19.291
Raise your hand
if you vote for Stefan.

16:21.000 --> 16:21.791
Me too!

16:37.583 --> 16:39.041
Hang on there!

16:39.333 --> 16:43.874
- The rescue's coming.
- The rescue's swimming.

17:14.500 --> 17:15.499
Come.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.457
Just trying.

18:08.833 --> 18:09.999
Mum, please!

18:22.750 --> 18:24.332
You look like dad!

18:24.667 --> 18:25.874
Me too!

18:33.042 --> 18:34.499
Madam, may I have this dance?

18:53.375 --> 18:57.624
Swear you won't get mixed up
in anything. Swear!

18:58.250 --> 19:02.749
I swear that I will bear
true faith to my Fatherland,

19:02.958 --> 19:06.749
that I will defend its honour
and fight for its liberation,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.499
even if it means
sacrificing my life.

19:09.750 --> 19:13.749
I pledge obedience
to the President of Poland

19:14.000 --> 19:17.999
and the Home Army Commander
whom he has appointed.

19:19.125 --> 19:22.666
I pledge to resolutely keep secret
whatever may happen to me.

19:23.542 --> 19:25.749
I accept you into the ranks
of the Polish Army,

19:26.167 --> 19:29.624
waging a war with the enemy
for the liberation of our Fatherland.

19:30.458 --> 19:32.999
It will be your duty to engage
in armed combat.

19:33.375 --> 19:36.624
Victory will be your reward.
Treason will be punished by death.

19:36.833 --> 19:39.999
So help us God!
Everything clear?

19:40.250 --> 19:40.791
Clear.

19:41.583 --> 19:44.832
Not 'clear' but:
'Yes, sir!'

19:45.292 --> 19:46.832
Yes, sir!

19:49.500 --> 19:53.499
And put those shoes back in the wardrobe,
you're not in the circus. Congrats!

19:56.583 --> 20:00.249
- These are lovely. His dad's.
- First class!

20:06.500 --> 20:07.166
Enough!

20:08.292 --> 20:11.541
- Two rounds per person, I said!
- No, you did not.

20:12.125 --> 20:16.082
- Easy, Goral!
- That's no playground!

20:16.333 --> 20:18.999
You've got to listen to the commander.

20:19.125 --> 20:21.457
The guy's new,
but see how accurate he is.

20:21.750 --> 20:25.291
So what?
Your life may depend on obedience.

20:25.542 --> 20:29.499
This is Stefan Zawadzki -
son of Hanna Zawadzka - the actress.

20:29.667 --> 20:32.249
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes, we know her!

20:33.000 --> 20:37.166
I admired your mother's acting
in that comedy starring Bodo.

20:37.458 --> 20:38.999
With Dymsza,
her best role.

20:39.333 --> 20:42.082
- Great actress. A brunette, right?
- No, a blonde.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.999
- A Greta Garbo lookalike.
- That's half the battle.

20:46.167 --> 20:48.499
You know Ala? Ala...

20:50.000 --> 20:51.166
What's your...?

20:51.500 --> 20:53.791
- Stefan.
- But we have already met.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.624
- It doesn't matter, let's do it again.
- Nice to meet you.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.332
Well, well!

20:58.500 --> 21:01.999
Nalkowska visits us and she must've drummed
all this emancipation into Ala's head.

21:02.167 --> 21:05.249
Okay, who's drumming emancipation
here in the first place?

21:06.167 --> 21:08.791
That's just like Papa.
Please join us for dinner!

21:09.000 --> 21:12.999
He's not shy,
he's just unrefined.

21:13.292 --> 21:18.124
- You know what his situation is at home.
- His mother is apparently not quite...

21:18.292 --> 21:20.041
- No.
- So you said.

21:20.542 --> 21:24.332
We'll get back before curfew?
Mum is probably worried.

21:25.042 --> 21:26.832
We eat, then we go.

21:27.375 --> 21:30.291
An uprising in these circumstances
makes no sense.

21:30.625 --> 21:33.832
The Russians will come.
But they're bound to stay for good.

21:34.625 --> 21:37.791
- The West will help.
- We are part of Europe.

21:38.125 --> 21:40.749
They don't give a damn
about our country.

21:40.875 --> 21:42.957
The Poles are counting on Russian help,

21:43.083 --> 21:46.541
but so far no-one's heard
of any talks with Stalin,

21:46.750 --> 21:49.291
who doesn't give a damn about us,
pardon my French.

21:49.500 --> 21:51.166
I need to go.
Who's got the keys?

21:51.333 --> 21:53.791
- Don't you like it here?
- I need to go.

21:59.000 --> 22:02.082
- Stefan wants to go home.
- No, we'll go in the morning.

22:02.792 --> 22:05.249
We have to wait.
The goods arrive in the morning.

22:09.083 --> 22:11.624
- As in the paintings of Delacroix.
- Dad, nobody's listening.

22:23.625 --> 22:26.374
- Stefan, what is it?
- You said fifteen minutes!

22:26.833 --> 22:28.249
A hero! Alright!

22:57.750 --> 22:58.999
How is it?

23:09.542 --> 23:10.874
Here you are at last!

23:21.167 --> 23:23.749
Quiet!
Can you hear it?

23:25.250 --> 23:27.582
The front line!

23:28.042 --> 23:29.749
Things are going to happen!

23:42.333 --> 23:46.832
How could you do this to me?
You've been lying all this time!

23:47.250 --> 23:49.332
I thought they've killed you!

23:49.958 --> 23:51.832
You promised!
You're a traitor!

23:52.000 --> 23:54.332
- Mum, please!
- You're a liar!

23:55.000 --> 23:57.749
- Mum, please!
- Everyone's lying.

23:58.167 --> 24:00.166
You're all liars!

24:00.792 --> 24:05.832
He also lied he'd return home!
Can't you get it?

24:06.083 --> 24:12.291
He also said
he would return home!

24:16.083 --> 24:19.249
I've got no one left, I'm all alone...

24:20.583 --> 24:25.499
There's no one left, I'm all alone...

24:41.042 --> 24:44.249
Sweetheart, get up.
Get up!

24:50.500 --> 24:52.291
Wake mum up,
I don't have the guts to.

24:58.792 --> 25:00.166
Don't sit there.

25:00.958 --> 25:04.166
- The Russians have reached Warsaw.
- Yeah, and...?

25:05.750 --> 25:08.499
The uprising starts today,
I've just found out.

25:09.250 --> 25:11.332
The further away from the city, the better.

25:16.000 --> 25:17.499
You're going to thank me for that!

25:29.458 --> 25:30.374
Myshkin...

25:33.250 --> 25:34.666
What am I to do?

25:35.750 --> 25:36.749
Tell me.

25:47.458 --> 25:50.041
- How's my horse?
- It's still not ready.

25:50.250 --> 25:50.874
Hi!

25:51.042 --> 25:53.082
- So, can I ride it now?
- No, you can't.

25:53.250 --> 25:54.499
- Please!
- Back to your friends.

25:54.667 --> 25:58.249
- It's gonna be fine soon!
- Great!

25:59.000 --> 26:01.499
- At the factory.
- Today?

26:02.167 --> 26:03.749
How long can it take?

26:04.583 --> 26:07.499
They say two or three days.
The Soviets have taken Legionowo.

26:08.500 --> 26:09.374
Kama!

26:12.750 --> 26:13.791
See you!

26:14.750 --> 26:15.666
Coming.

26:19.500 --> 26:20.624
Let's go.

26:40.083 --> 26:41.249
Jasio!

26:42.000 --> 26:44.041
Come see! Mum's cooking.

26:47.292 --> 26:50.124
Jasio! Have a try!

26:53.792 --> 26:54.957
What are you doing?

26:57.750 --> 26:58.749
Nothing.

27:00.833 --> 27:02.041
Tell me.

27:04.250 --> 27:05.291
I can't.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.582
Please.

27:08.000 --> 27:09.124
Oh, stop it.

27:09.583 --> 27:11.582
- Where are you going?
- Jasio!

27:12.333 --> 27:15.541
- Jasio, please!
- Don't leave me.

27:15.750 --> 27:17.666
Please!
I don't want to be alone.

27:17.875 --> 27:21.582
You mustn't snivel.
Take care of mum, the way I do, OK?

27:22.958 --> 27:24.749
You can't tell mum, OK?

27:25.167 --> 27:28.332
Please don't go.
You won't leave me, right?

27:28.500 --> 27:29.999
Don't tell mum...

27:31.333 --> 27:32.291
Jasio!

27:32.750 --> 27:34.999
Please don't go.

29:02.083 --> 29:03.749
Gosh... this is beautiful...

29:04.458 --> 29:06.582
- Hi, guys!
- No respect for orders!

29:06.958 --> 29:10.999
- Rogal, here you are.
- Why didn't you come tomorrow?

29:11.500 --> 29:14.582
Thanks, the right or the left arm?
- The left one.

29:14.750 --> 29:16.791
- Here you are.
- So...

29:17.125 --> 29:19.041
It's going to be an interesting day.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.666
Who's afraid? Admit it!

29:22.750 --> 29:24.291
- Me.
- Yeah, sure!

29:25.500 --> 29:26.957
Where's Aleksander?

29:27.250 --> 29:30.582
This VIS is rather for an officer.
Perhaps you could use it.

29:30.750 --> 29:31.541
You're right!

29:33.542 --> 29:34.582
How many of you are there?

29:35.500 --> 29:37.624
There were eight,
but one didn't make it.

29:38.042 --> 29:39.749
How many of you 'are'
not 'were' there?

29:40.333 --> 29:41.332
Seven.

29:42.625 --> 29:43.999
Take mine.

29:44.125 --> 29:45.332
Thank you.

29:49.000 --> 29:49.832
Attention!

29:50.167 --> 29:53.249
Listen, we're joining another detail.
This is Cobra.

29:53.958 --> 29:54.999
At ease.

29:55.125 --> 29:56.999
- Lieutenant Cobra.
- Greetings.

29:57.292 --> 30:02.249
All men - weaklings,
but the girls are gorgeous...

30:03.292 --> 30:05.249
Now, together we're going to...

30:06.375 --> 30:07.791
eat, sleep...

30:09.750 --> 30:11.249
and maybe even...

30:12.125 --> 30:15.541
- ... do a little singing.
- I've already got a partner for a duet.

30:15.750 --> 30:17.082
Which one?

30:17.250 --> 30:18.374
He's not here yet.

30:18.542 --> 30:20.499
The absent have no say.

30:21.458 --> 30:24.749
Let's shake hands.
Thank you. The map.

30:24.875 --> 30:30.332
There are Jewish prisoners in the building.
We're covering an attack from the north.

30:30.583 --> 30:34.666
This is a school.
We're attacking from the front.

30:36.083 --> 30:38.582
- Where are the others?
- We had no way of letting them know.

30:38.750 --> 30:40.582
So, we're missing half of our people too.

30:41.000 --> 30:42.582
We'll get by.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.041
Let it start!

30:44.250 --> 30:46.874
What about... the weapons?

30:47.250 --> 30:48.374
Don't you have your own?

30:48.667 --> 30:49.749
Where from?

30:51.000 --> 30:53.124
Spider, give a hand grenade each.

30:53.375 --> 30:56.374
Excuse me. We're attacking
with just two pieces?

30:57.500 --> 30:59.374
Two days tops and it'll be over.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.499
Attention!

31:06.500 --> 31:08.582
Soldiers of the Polish
Underground State!

31:08.750 --> 31:11.499
Soviet divisions are waiting
on the outskirts of the capital.

31:12.458 --> 31:14.582
We're counting on them
to take advantage of our uprising

31:14.750 --> 31:16.791
and enter the city within days.

31:17.875 --> 31:20.041
Remember who you pledged allegiance to.

31:20.958 --> 31:23.041
You answer only to
the Polish Commander-in-Chief

31:23.250 --> 31:24.791
and the command of the Home Army.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.541
There is no fraternising
with the Bolsheviks.

31:28.333 --> 31:32.499
The Soviets are to be treated with reserve,
as allies of our allies.

31:33.167 --> 31:34.332
Disperse!

31:34.750 --> 31:35.749
At ease!

31:36.250 --> 31:37.041
To your positions.

32:15.375 --> 32:16.332
Rogal!
Spider!

32:24.667 --> 32:25.832
Crybaby! Grenade!

32:26.000 --> 32:28.082
- Should I throw it?
- No, bloody eat it!

32:39.250 --> 32:40.291
Stefan, stop...

32:41.167 --> 32:41.874
Stefan, stop!

32:42.458 --> 32:43.499
Get back!

32:43.875 --> 32:44.999
That's an order!

33:03.500 --> 33:04.791
Stefan, stop!

33:05.500 --> 33:06.749
Stop!

33:09.292 --> 33:10.541
Turn round!

33:12.167 --> 33:13.082
Hands up!

33:18.625 --> 33:19.999
We've got a prisoner.

33:58.875 --> 34:01.457
Don't be afraid.
We're Polish soldiers.

34:02.542 --> 34:04.749
There's an uprising.
You are free.

34:20.083 --> 34:21.748
Can I join you?

34:24.750 --> 34:28.123
The uprising is almost over, mate...
You're free.

34:28.833 --> 34:30.541
I want to fight.

34:31.250 --> 34:32.498
The school's taken.

34:33.292 --> 34:34.581
I have no-one else left.

34:40.083 --> 34:41.248
Alright.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.498
Come, mate, you can come in handy.

34:47.375 --> 34:48.498
Stefan...

34:48.625 --> 34:49.831
Give me the gun.

34:55.000 --> 34:58.832
Playing a hero?
Try it again and you'll be sorry.

35:11.167 --> 35:14.582
- Where are you heading, gentlemen?
- Paris, may I, madam.

35:14.750 --> 35:16.749
- What's your name?
- What business is it of yours?

35:16.958 --> 35:19.874
- Was I asking you?
- Want me to pick up your boy?

35:57.750 --> 35:59.832
- First day behind us! Hi, girls!
- Hi!

36:00.000 --> 36:03.624
- They're gorgeous with those uniforms on.
- Wonder what they look like with them off.

36:03.792 --> 36:05.374
Please, leave this.
It's army supplies.

36:05.542 --> 36:06.249
Rogal!

36:07.167 --> 36:08.791
- This one or that one?
- This one.

36:09.000 --> 36:09.874
Stefan!

36:10.125 --> 36:12.041
You're on guard duty!
Watching the food.

36:12.250 --> 36:14.457
- OK.
- We've got a piece for you.

36:14.583 --> 36:17.832
- Miki! Show him.
- OK.

36:18.750 --> 36:19.749
Listen...

36:20.000 --> 36:23.166
It's an accurate gun,
it's just that parts are worn out.

36:37.458 --> 36:38.791
We've got the city centre.

36:39.000 --> 36:42.249
But we failed to take
the railway station and the bridges.

36:42.458 --> 36:43.749
The boys are still fighting.

36:43.958 --> 36:44.957
And the Russians?

36:45.500 --> 36:46.582
No idea.

36:47.625 --> 36:49.999
- Goral, come!
- At least we've got the warehouse.

36:50.167 --> 36:52.999
That's almost with no losses.
Go get some sleep.

36:54.458 --> 36:55.332
Here.

36:57.125 --> 37:00.374
- We're running out of wine.
- Poor guy...

37:01.500 --> 37:03.249
Where was he from anyway?

37:04.375 --> 37:05.791
That was Cobra's brother.

37:06.167 --> 37:09.249
No way. His brother?
I'd break down.

37:14.500 --> 37:15.791
Why aren't you singing?

37:16.500 --> 37:18.999
- Why don't you have a drink!
- I'll go get something.

37:19.250 --> 37:20.499
- I'll go with you.
- Easy, I'll go.

37:20.667 --> 37:22.124
No, you keep playing.

37:22.375 --> 37:23.749
- Where to?
- Just look around.

37:23.958 --> 37:25.791
- Bottles may be anywhere.
- Shall we?

37:26.958 --> 37:28.624
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

37:35.875 --> 37:37.874
So where are we going?

37:38.125 --> 37:39.749
Why don't we split up.

37:39.958 --> 37:41.957
I'll go here, you go there.

38:25.750 --> 38:28.041
Gentlemen, could you watch
the food for a while, please?

38:28.250 --> 38:29.832
- No problem.
- Thank you.

38:35.792 --> 38:37.791
- Now you deal five cards.
- Play!

38:38.000 --> 38:41.957
Why did the French erect the Eiffel tower?
So the Germans could see the white flag.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.749
Gentlemen, have you seen
the guy on duty here?

38:45.000 --> 38:47.166
When a guy's gotta go,
he's gotta go.

38:50.542 --> 38:51.832
But we're not going anywhere.

39:40.750 --> 39:43.499
Easy, when they start, we run.

40:25.083 --> 40:26.624
You want to be treated like a soldier?

40:26.792 --> 40:30.832
- But, sir...
- Did you have a replacement on duty?

40:31.042 --> 40:33.249
Then why was nobody watching it?

40:34.750 --> 40:36.291
I thought you were grown up.

40:36.833 --> 40:38.291
Well?

40:40.250 --> 40:42.249
You want to play war?

40:45.333 --> 40:46.832
Like we're pretend-dying?

40:49.750 --> 40:50.999
Then let's play!

40:52.083 --> 40:54.749
I'll go wake up those in coffins!

40:58.750 --> 40:59.749
At ease!

41:03.542 --> 41:04.541
Stefan, attention!

41:07.792 --> 41:08.666
Your punishment...

41:09.250 --> 41:11.582
You had it too easy,
so now you'll wash dishes.

41:11.875 --> 41:13.666
Goral, come on...

41:30.333 --> 41:31.999
Grab him by the legs!

41:32.833 --> 41:34.124
By the legs.

41:38.250 --> 41:39.499
Attention!

41:43.167 --> 41:44.249
At ease.

41:49.500 --> 41:52.291
Who thought the uprising
would last three days...

41:53.542 --> 41:54.791
...was wrong.

41:56.833 --> 41:58.749
We're going to enjoy it
a few days more.

42:00.667 --> 42:02.082
The Germans got reinforcements.

42:03.292 --> 42:05.166
We expect an assault at any point.

42:05.542 --> 42:06.791
There's an order

42:07.000 --> 42:09.332
to move the arm band
from left to right!

42:13.667 --> 42:15.249
Everyone take your positions.

42:17.375 --> 42:20.457
You'll finish your soup later,
it's better not to eat now.

42:23.167 --> 42:24.291
Sir,

42:24.750 --> 42:26.999
do we know what's happening
on the other side of the wall?

42:27.292 --> 42:28.999
Do we have any units there?

42:32.542 --> 42:35.291
- My mother lives there.
- Everyone's got someone.

42:35.750 --> 42:38.499
You, focus on your dishes.
We'll do the shooting.

42:38.625 --> 42:41.832
Easy. I have no people and
he's playing with pots and pans?

42:43.667 --> 42:46.124
- Give him some toy, he'll join us.
- What do I give him?

42:46.458 --> 42:49.499
- I don't have a gun.
- He'll take a gun from the Germans.

42:51.125 --> 42:52.082
Come.

42:52.833 --> 42:53.832
Michal!

42:55.000 --> 42:55.957
Ready?

42:57.000 --> 42:58.082
See the tree?

42:59.167 --> 43:00.124
Uh-huh.

43:00.500 --> 43:02.249
Then climb as high as you can

43:02.458 --> 43:04.082
and give us a shout
when you see something.

43:04.250 --> 43:04.999
Yes, sir.

43:14.542 --> 43:16.249
- What am I supposed to do?
- Nothing.

43:16.542 --> 43:18.499
Watch the end of the uprising...

43:19.250 --> 43:23.582
- What do you mean the end?
- The Germans have got reinforcements.

43:23.750 --> 43:27.124
The Russians have stopped their offensive
and now they're just waiting for us to die.

43:27.292 --> 43:30.749
You thought someone would help us?
Everyone cares about themselves.

43:32.750 --> 43:34.249
With the first chance...

43:42.167 --> 43:43.957
Attention!

43:48.875 --> 43:50.541
Don't fire without an order!

43:51.375 --> 43:52.541
Stop shooting!

44:04.458 --> 44:07.541
Where are you going?
Take positions, I said!

44:13.292 --> 44:14.499
Now! Fire!

44:47.875 --> 44:49.499
From left to right.

48:32.875 --> 48:34.249
You motherfuckers!

48:34.458 --> 48:36.082
What have you done to her?

49:24.833 --> 49:25.582
It's me.

49:27.083 --> 49:28.166
Look at me!

49:33.375 --> 49:34.832
He doesn't recognise us.

49:38.000 --> 49:39.582
Don't panic, he'll pull through.

49:39.750 --> 49:43.541
Pull through?
It's the end of the uprising for this guy.

49:44.667 --> 49:46.832
Lucky they've found him.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.999
Poor thing. How are you going
to stay here now?

49:53.250 --> 49:55.749
Get moving or the uprising will end.

49:57.792 --> 50:00.499
You're on guard duty here, mate.

50:03.000 --> 50:04.291
We're waiting.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.291
- Got it?
- Yeah.

50:22.625 --> 50:24.999
It's just a scratch,
it's a waste of a bandage.

50:25.167 --> 50:28.624
- Relax. How old are you?
- I'll be sixteen in December.

50:29.500 --> 50:31.582
I think they're bombing the hospital.

50:35.125 --> 50:35.874
I'll go!

50:36.375 --> 50:38.082
Kama!
We have to report this.

50:40.292 --> 50:41.249
So I'll report it.

50:54.000 --> 50:54.582
Excuse me.

51:04.583 --> 51:05.666
No pass. There's a briefing.

51:05.833 --> 51:08.041
- I want to report something.
- You have to wait.

51:09.500 --> 51:11.082
So there's only the sewers left.

51:11.500 --> 51:14.791
- Organise a sewers communication team.
- Yes, sir.

51:15.000 --> 51:17.832
We have to recognise the passages
to Zoliborz and the Centre.

51:18.250 --> 51:21.249
You guard the Mostowski Palace.
They'll attack you from Muranow.

51:23.083 --> 51:24.874
Sir, lost connection with HQ.

51:26.667 --> 51:29.499
- Any good news?
- Two German tanks destroyed.

51:29.750 --> 51:33.291
- They're bombing the hospital, Stefan's there.
- But we're going in soon.

51:33.583 --> 51:34.582
We must get him out.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.499
- Perhaps...
- Perhaps... we've got orders.

51:38.292 --> 51:39.124
Yes, sir.

51:42.875 --> 51:43.749
Please.

51:44.833 --> 51:47.624
- I have to go for him.
- Desertion is punishable by death!

51:51.875 --> 51:52.832
Dismissed!

52:02.792 --> 52:04.082
Where's Ladybird?!

52:06.250 --> 52:09.291
Madam, I'm ready.
Can I get back there?

52:22.375 --> 52:23.957
Don't go there, miss.

52:28.875 --> 52:29.791
Stefan!

52:40.542 --> 52:41.832
Stefan!

53:20.250 --> 53:22.666
Let's get up together.
Hear me?

53:23.083 --> 53:24.666
Let's go.

53:27.042 --> 53:29.957
Come on, get up!
Hear me?

53:41.083 --> 53:43.624
People, help!
They're trapped in the basement!

53:43.792 --> 53:47.082
- Please help!
- Look, he hardly walks.

53:47.250 --> 53:50.374
He has two hands, two legs!
People, help!

54:08.542 --> 54:10.249
I'll be back in a minute, stay put.

54:13.000 --> 54:16.249
Come on everyone!
We've captured a German tank!

54:16.458 --> 54:19.332
A tank? But there's no turret.
No idea what it is.

54:26.792 --> 54:28.957
Excuse me, is there any vacancy?

54:36.375 --> 54:36.874
Maria!

54:37.375 --> 54:38.999
Let's look at the tank they've won!

54:39.250 --> 54:41.374
- I'm scared.
- There's nothing to be scared of.

54:41.667 --> 54:43.999
What is this flower?
For me?

55:06.750 --> 55:09.124
Just for one night!
Our home's burnt down!

55:09.292 --> 55:13.749
It's just my brother and I!
We're not insurgents! I beg you!

55:13.875 --> 55:15.749
Try the sisters, miss.

55:15.958 --> 55:18.041
The convent is just over there.

55:18.500 --> 55:21.457
- But don't tell anyone else, please.
- Thank you.

57:03.292 --> 57:04.624
The tank has exploded.

57:10.500 --> 57:11.124
Excuse me.

57:11.292 --> 57:15.041
Have you seen a boy
with a bandaged chest?

57:22.500 --> 57:27.124
Excuse me, I'm looking for
a girl in a dress, I took her picture?

57:39.833 --> 57:41.332
How could you!

57:41.583 --> 57:43.791
You can't just leave like that!
Understand?

57:44.000 --> 57:45.749
Don't you ever do that to me!

57:46.083 --> 57:47.499
How could you?!

57:49.250 --> 57:51.832
Don't ever leave me!

58:11.583 --> 58:12.791
These should fit.

58:13.000 --> 58:14.082
Thank you, Sister.

58:16.167 --> 58:17.541
God bless you.

58:18.333 --> 58:21.457
That's the thing, Sister.
Where is God?

58:22.292 --> 58:24.749
- Busy with something else?
- Why involve God in all of this?

58:25.250 --> 58:27.291
The Old Town will fall anyway.

58:27.500 --> 58:28.624
We need to run.

58:28.792 --> 58:29.541
Sure, but where?

58:29.750 --> 58:32.249
- To the centre.
- Why are you laughing?

58:32.375 --> 58:35.499
They say the centre is like in Paris.
Press, cinema...

58:36.833 --> 58:37.832
Yes, sir!

58:43.083 --> 58:44.082
At ease.

58:44.750 --> 58:47.166
We're retreating through the sewers.

58:48.292 --> 58:49.249
Only army.

59:11.292 --> 59:13.749
You'll have more strength, lieutenant.

59:13.958 --> 59:15.291
Captain.

59:15.500 --> 59:17.124
Do I really look that bad?

59:18.625 --> 59:20.041
Thank you.

59:21.083 --> 59:22.541
I'll take it with me.

59:24.125 --> 59:26.249
And where are you headed?

59:34.375 --> 59:36.291
You have a lovely smile, miss.

59:37.000 --> 59:38.999
You should smile more often.

59:50.833 --> 59:53.249
What about these people here?
The captain says they're staying?

59:53.458 --> 59:54.999
We can't fit all in the sewers.

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:09.249
No pass to anyone.

01:00:10.042 --> 01:00:12.291
Step back!

01:00:12.750 --> 01:00:14.666
- Excuse me.
- No pass.

01:00:15.083 --> 01:00:16.791
- Excuse me.
- That's an order.

01:00:17.792 --> 01:00:19.957
Please don't touch me.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.291
Lady, what are you pushing for?
Goddamn it!

01:00:23.792 --> 01:00:24.999
We're all waiting.

01:00:25.583 --> 01:00:27.499
Let us through,
we're from the detail!

01:00:27.667 --> 01:00:30.499
Everyone says that!
My son was from the detail, too!

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:32.541
Don't touch me.

01:00:33.167 --> 01:00:36.374
Captain, it's me!

01:00:36.792 --> 01:00:39.499
From the detail in the convent!

01:00:41.750 --> 01:00:42.624
Easy now!

01:00:45.250 --> 01:00:46.082
With my brother.

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:48.582
- With whom?
- With my brother. Can we go in?

01:00:52.792 --> 01:00:54.332
Let them pass.
He's wounded.

01:00:54.542 --> 01:00:56.666
Be careful.
They're shooting from above.

01:00:59.750 --> 01:01:00.791
It's quiet down there.

01:01:01.042 --> 01:01:02.291
You get out at Warecka street.

01:01:02.667 --> 01:01:03.332
Bottle.

01:01:09.083 --> 01:01:09.666
Go!

01:01:09.875 --> 01:01:10.624
Go!

01:01:11.875 --> 01:01:14.041
Absolutely quiet.
Or I won't see you again.

01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:16.291
Thank you!

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.999
Ask for Karol from Barry's group.
But you'll forget anyway.

01:01:44.458 --> 01:01:46.249
Do you intend to stay here, miss?

01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:48.749
Anyone else?

01:01:49.250 --> 01:01:50.457
Move on!

01:01:52.958 --> 01:01:55.499
- Where are we?
- Hush!

01:01:57.292 --> 01:01:58.541
Quiet!

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:13.041
Stop.

01:02:19.958 --> 01:02:21.332
It's not here.

01:02:28.833 --> 01:02:30.082
Where are we?

01:02:31.250 --> 01:02:32.582
I don't know. The Centre?

01:02:38.792 --> 01:02:41.666
- Grenade!
- Run!

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:44.374
Great victory!

01:03:44.542 --> 01:03:47.457
The insurgents have taken
the Saint Cross church,

01:03:47.583 --> 01:03:53.249
the Nazi Gendarmerie
and Foreign Affairs HQ.

01:03:53.667 --> 01:03:56.082
We've released several dozen
civilian hostages...

01:03:56.250 --> 01:03:58.082
Some water, please.

01:03:59.792 --> 01:04:00.749
From which detachment?

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:07.541
Your quarters are very near.

01:04:07.750 --> 01:04:08.957
- Ewa!
- Yes?

01:04:10.125 --> 01:04:12.249
- And them? Where to?
- To the bank.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.832
Unfortunately, German artillery
was shelling the Old Town all night.

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:20.124
There are no untouched
buildings left there.

01:04:20.250 --> 01:04:21.999
Civilian traffic has died out.

01:04:22.375 --> 01:04:26.791
City centre citizens are asked
to offer all help

01:04:27.167 --> 01:04:29.957
to those evacuating from the Old Town.

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:34.874
Great victory!

01:04:35.042 --> 01:04:37.749
The insurgents have taken
the Saint Cross church...

01:05:07.125 --> 01:05:09.249
- Look at them!
- Master race!

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:12.041
Look at you now, murderers!

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.541
- Dad, water!
- You, upstairs!

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:20.374
- More towels!
- No, there! Wiktor, show them!

01:05:22.958 --> 01:05:24.166
Guys, this way.

01:05:25.250 --> 01:05:26.624
Stas, help them.

01:05:27.667 --> 01:05:31.457
You have to find yourselves some place.
Hear me?

01:07:16.667 --> 01:07:18.166
Move it, to the basement!

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.874
- Stop!
- You're defending the motherfucker?!

01:07:45.125 --> 01:07:46.999
Let me in!

01:07:48.083 --> 01:07:50.666
I'm gonna kill the German rat!

01:07:56.083 --> 01:07:59.249
Press it here.
Stay with him, I'll get some help.

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:05.957
Stop!

01:08:06.458 --> 01:08:09.249
Come on, run up the stairs!

01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:34.832
What are you doing?!

01:08:35.292 --> 01:08:36.749
Press it!

01:08:38.250 --> 01:08:42.749
They murdered my wife!
My life!

01:08:47.667 --> 01:08:49.832
A doctor!

01:09:03.042 --> 01:09:06.832
Praised be the lord, Father!
Here comes the youth!

01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:11.249
- We're Cobra's detail!
- You're the guys from the Old Town!

01:09:11.375 --> 01:09:14.582
- Stuff of legends now!
- We gave the Germans a rough ride!

01:09:14.792 --> 01:09:15.666
Father, could you?

01:09:15.832 --> 01:09:18.791
- Can you get them married, please?
-You guys?

01:09:19.292 --> 01:09:22.457
No, not them!
To the altar!

01:09:22.582 --> 01:09:23.957
Let's go then!

01:09:27.957 --> 01:09:29.499
What are your names?

01:09:29.750 --> 01:09:32.291
- Franciszek.
- Beata.

01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.374
Give each other your right hands.

01:10:38.792 --> 01:10:40.957
May I have this dance, miss?

01:11:06.792 --> 01:11:12.332
As soon as it's possible,
we'll get out of the city.

01:11:14.250 --> 01:11:16.582
I've been asking around.

01:11:17.667 --> 01:11:22.082
We'll run as far away as we can
and nothing will split us up.

01:11:23.542 --> 01:11:25.249
Just you and me.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.499
That's the most important thing,
for the two of us to survive, isn't it?

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:37.874
I want to continue living for you.

01:12:10.458 --> 01:12:13.499
Ladybird!
Come on, you gotta help me.

01:12:13.625 --> 01:12:14.874
- Where's Stefan?
- No idea!

01:12:15.042 --> 01:12:16.749
They're attacking now the city centre!

01:12:21.292 --> 01:12:23.499
You haven't seen Stefan?

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.749
Have you seen Stefan?
The wounded one?

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:30.957
I saw him talk to the insurgents
who got married yesterday.

01:12:31.083 --> 01:12:32.249
Nah, he wasn't there.

01:12:33.458 --> 01:12:35.666
I saw him carrying the wounded.

01:12:35.833 --> 01:12:37.999
He carried nobody,
he wasn't here at all.

01:12:38.167 --> 01:12:41.249
- What?
- Just kidding. I don't know him.

01:12:41.375 --> 01:12:45.124
He was with the Group "Radoslaw".
I think they went to Czerniakow.

01:12:45.292 --> 01:12:47.749
You won't get
there without a pass.

01:13:03.833 --> 01:13:06.124
So why do want to get there?

01:13:07.042 --> 01:13:10.499
To your brother?
Can't he manage on his own?

01:13:38.792 --> 01:13:39.791
Get undressed.

01:14:10.958 --> 01:14:11.791
Excuse me!

01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.457
Back to your mummy!
Stop!

01:14:16.583 --> 01:14:18.791
- I have a pass...
- Me too!

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.999
Stand back, now!
The line is closed.

01:14:21.250 --> 01:14:24.499
Stop! I told you, kid!
Are you deaf?!

01:14:25.167 --> 01:14:27.332
- But I've got letters to deliver!
- No way!

01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:29.666
Get out of here!
No pass!

01:14:29.833 --> 01:14:32.749
Tanks! Russians!

01:14:38.333 --> 01:14:39.832
Stop!!!

01:14:50.583 --> 01:14:52.166
The Germans have blown up the bridge!

01:14:56.542 --> 01:14:57.957
They've cut us off.

01:15:01.875 --> 01:15:03.874
No passage!

01:16:29.875 --> 01:16:31.457
What are you doing here?

01:16:31.750 --> 01:16:33.666
To the basement!
The line's closed.

01:16:34.875 --> 01:16:36.832
I don't care about your pass!
To the basement!

01:16:40.292 --> 01:16:42.749
Where are the guys from the centre?
I'm looking for my brother.

01:16:42.958 --> 01:16:44.499
No idea, really.

01:17:09.125 --> 01:17:11.749
When Russians see a woman...

01:17:11.958 --> 01:17:13.624
No place in here.

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:39.457
This is great.
Straight from my uncle in Karczew.

01:17:40.750 --> 01:17:43.041
Coffee from Kama!

01:17:46.333 --> 01:17:47.541
Poles!

01:17:50.250 --> 01:17:52.499
You stupid Poles!

01:17:54.833 --> 01:17:56.624
God damn Poles!

01:17:57.958 --> 01:18:00.874
We don't kill prisoners,
Mister German!

01:18:01.250 --> 01:18:02.582
See?

01:18:03.458 --> 01:18:06.499
It's because of you guys
that I can't stroke my sweetheart.

01:18:06.625 --> 01:18:09.499
You can stroke all right,
you just can't strangle.

01:18:11.542 --> 01:18:13.374
Haven't you seen a German?

01:18:15.750 --> 01:18:16.999
We'll exterminate you.

01:18:17.125 --> 01:18:19.666
Every single one of you.
No one will help you.

01:18:19.875 --> 01:18:23.249
Stupid Poles, no one gives a damn!

01:18:24.458 --> 01:18:27.832
Such a good looking guy
with a foul tongue.

01:18:33.125 --> 01:18:34.124
Captain...

01:18:38.333 --> 01:18:40.832
My men are at your service.

01:18:48.792 --> 01:18:49.999
These children?

01:18:51.958 --> 01:18:53.666
It's good they're not retired, right?

01:18:56.042 --> 01:18:58.832
These are Berling's men.
They're going with us

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.999
to take No 1 Wilanowska Street,
reach the river.

01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:05.999
No one's gonna help you,
no one will miss you.

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:17.999
Follow them, dismissed!

01:19:18.667 --> 01:19:19.999
Don't let yourselves get killed!

01:19:23.667 --> 01:19:24.666
Leave this scrap here.

01:19:27.458 --> 01:19:28.249
Take this.

01:19:38.292 --> 01:19:40.457
They say the Russians
have crossed the river!

01:19:41.083 --> 01:19:44.541
What Russians! It's Poles.
General Berling's people.

01:19:46.083 --> 01:19:48.749
Berling is a traitor.
A deserter who joined the Russians.

01:19:50.083 --> 01:19:53.166
Who knows what he's actually done.
So cut that crap!

01:19:53.333 --> 01:19:56.749
How could they help?
A bunch of country boys!

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:58.749
Can't you calm your kid down, lady?

01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:23.999
God almighty!
May these be Russians.

01:20:26.250 --> 01:20:29.666
Let's just get out and surrender.

01:20:33.583 --> 01:20:35.166
We'll walk out with the little one...

01:20:49.083 --> 01:20:50.457
It's the Russians, I think.

01:20:52.083 --> 01:20:53.082
We've made it!

01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:00.082
God, save me!

01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.999
Next basement!

01:21:23.250 --> 01:21:25.332
What are you doing?

01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:26.832
The child!

01:21:35.625 --> 01:21:37.291
A small baby!

01:21:37.625 --> 01:21:38.957
Something's wrong with it.

01:21:39.083 --> 01:21:42.166
To the hospital!
It's over there!

01:22:00.750 --> 01:22:02.874
Can anyone come here?

01:22:03.667 --> 01:22:06.832
- Can you please have a look?
- Can't you see I'm busy?

01:22:08.042 --> 01:22:09.249
Doctor...

01:22:14.083 --> 01:22:15.999
- Doctor!
- You need to wait.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:20.291
- Look at this kid, this instant!
- Sister!

01:22:22.125 --> 01:22:23.541
You think you're the priority?

01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:25.791
It's only me here,
I haven't slept in a week,

01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:30.082
I have some students to assist me,
all of them passing out all the time.

01:22:30.333 --> 01:22:32.666
Lusia!
This kid is dead!

01:22:33.875 --> 01:22:34.957
Your daughter?

01:22:36.292 --> 01:22:37.624
Right...

01:22:38.292 --> 01:22:39.541
Some water?

01:22:47.167 --> 01:22:48.124
People!

01:23:16.958 --> 01:23:19.499
Please help him!
He's just a kid!

01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:23.457
Excuse me!

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:30.457
Pass it, please?

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.499
They're hiding
in the upstairs windows.

01:23:51.375 --> 01:23:52.374
At your orders.

01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:55.791
The bastards are playing tango!

01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:56.791
Get ready to move!

01:23:57.000 --> 01:23:58.499
Patrol, follow me!

01:24:30.833 --> 01:24:33.624
It's such a pity - such a beautiful town.

01:24:34.042 --> 01:24:35.457
Your first time in Warsaw?

01:24:36.833 --> 01:24:39.249
First time in any city.

01:24:39.792 --> 01:24:41.832
But wherever you are you
fight the same way.

01:24:42.000 --> 01:24:43.999
- And how is that?
- The Polish way.

01:24:48.125 --> 01:24:49.874
No wonder your uprising
is going nowhere.

01:24:50.292 --> 01:24:53.999
- Go back, guys, you don't know the area.
- You've never seen a real battle.

01:24:54.125 --> 01:24:56.499
- Detail!
- It's different fighting in a city!

01:25:21.875 --> 01:25:24.041
Stay there! Stay!
Don't lean out!

01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:27.457
Stay there!

01:25:32.792 --> 01:25:34.249
I said stay!

01:25:38.292 --> 01:25:39.541
I got hit!

01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:47.749
Mum! Help me!
Don't leave me, guys!

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:50.582
Don't leave me!

01:25:54.542 --> 01:25:56.249
Stop!
Cover him!

01:26:06.667 --> 01:26:08.166
Let's regroup!
To the gate!

01:26:09.833 --> 01:26:11.374
Rogal!

01:26:15.625 --> 01:26:17.874
Give me a hand!
Let's take him.

01:26:19.250 --> 01:26:21.249
Shit, thank you very much
for such help!

01:26:21.375 --> 01:26:22.499
He got shot in the heart.

01:26:23.375 --> 01:26:25.791
We're pretty good
at getting killed ourselves!

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:27.041
Goral, the scouts!

01:26:27.667 --> 01:26:30.874
- Be prepared! We can't pass.
- We'll wait till night in this house.

01:26:31.042 --> 01:26:35.291
- Gentlemen, get back!
- At dawn we'll go through the basements.

01:26:35.667 --> 01:26:37.249
Take him!

01:26:48.125 --> 01:26:49.124
What are you doing?

01:26:52.375 --> 01:26:53.624
The VIS is mine.

01:30:29.750 --> 01:30:31.582
I'm not armed.

01:31:38.458 --> 01:31:40.041
A long time ago

01:31:40.958 --> 01:31:42.749
over a hill and far away

01:31:42.875 --> 01:31:44.624
there was a town.

01:31:44.792 --> 01:31:48.041
In this town there lived a boy.

01:31:48.250 --> 01:31:49.999
He had a family,

01:31:50.167 --> 01:31:52.041
he had many friends.

01:31:52.250 --> 01:31:53.582
Clear!

01:31:53.875 --> 01:31:55.249
They played together.

01:31:55.458 --> 01:31:59.791
They danced, went for walks,
they learned together.

01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:00.749
One day

01:32:00.958 --> 01:32:06.457
a bad king who wanted
to rule the whole world

01:32:06.750 --> 01:32:08.249
invaded their country

01:32:10.375 --> 01:32:11.624
and said:

01:32:11.792 --> 01:32:13.291
"I forbid you everything!

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:15.041
I forbid you to play,

01:32:15.250 --> 01:32:16.957
I forbid you to learn,

01:32:17.125 --> 01:32:18.499
You're not allowed to do anything!"

01:32:18.625 --> 01:32:20.874
But he couldn't forbid them
to do one thing.

01:32:21.042 --> 01:32:26.499
To dream about the day
when they will regain their freedom.

01:32:29.125 --> 01:32:29.999
Get packed.

01:32:30.125 --> 01:32:31.874
- Get the boys.
- Now?

01:32:34.833 --> 01:32:36.666
- What's happening?
- So much for our help!

01:32:36.833 --> 01:32:39.832
They said they'd prepare 100 dinghies,
twenty people each.

01:32:40.333 --> 01:32:41.832
But only for the soldiers.

01:32:42.625 --> 01:32:45.041
You help me get there.

01:32:45.750 --> 01:32:48.499
Don't be sad.
It breaks my heart.

01:32:58.292 --> 01:32:59.082
Ladybird,

01:32:59.250 --> 01:33:02.749
run to the HQ,
there must be some wounded there.

01:33:03.875 --> 01:33:05.499
I'll stay with this man.

01:33:05.625 --> 01:33:06.749
Poles!

01:33:07.042 --> 01:33:09.624
The Russians and the Allies
have deserted you.

01:33:09.792 --> 01:33:11.332
You have proven your valour!

01:33:11.500 --> 01:33:15.499
End this futile uprising
and surrender.

01:33:16.458 --> 01:33:18.791
Following General von dem Bach's order,

01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:22.249
nobody who surrenders will be harmed
in any way.

01:33:22.750 --> 01:33:25.666
This applies both to your soldiers
and civilians.

01:33:26.250 --> 01:33:27.499
We promise this to you.

01:33:27.625 --> 01:33:35.249
The German troops in Czerniakow
from noon until 1 will cease fire

01:33:35.583 --> 01:33:40.457
so that those not fighting
and the wounded in hospitals

01:33:40.583 --> 01:33:45.082
have a chance to safely leave the town.

01:33:45.500 --> 01:33:48.457
It is up to you, members of the Home Army,

01:33:48.583 --> 01:33:55.291
whether you choose to cease fire
to save your own Polish blood.

01:33:55.875 --> 01:34:02.332
If you put down your arms
we guarantee you your life, work and bread.

01:34:03.167 --> 01:34:10.541
Citizens presenting white scarves,
I repeat, white scarves,

01:34:10.792 --> 01:34:17.666
may leave the endangered areas
and head for safety with German troops.

01:34:18.500 --> 01:34:25.249
Otherwise our troops
will be forced to destroy you,

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:28.332
which will lead to
a large number of casualties.

01:34:28.750 --> 01:34:34.457
- Have mercy on the city's inhabitants.
- You have mercy, bastards!

01:34:35.458 --> 01:34:37.041
They're sending envoys.

01:34:40.792 --> 01:34:42.749
But now?!
Wonder what for?

01:34:59.625 --> 01:35:01.041
I solemnly swear

01:35:03.042 --> 01:35:04.499
I solemnly swear to you

01:35:07.292 --> 01:35:09.249
that I'll kill anyone

01:35:09.375 --> 01:35:11.957
who mentions
the word "surrender".

01:35:14.083 --> 01:35:15.291
Got it?

01:35:24.625 --> 01:35:29.166
Let us evacuate the hospital.
We have no personnel, nor space.

01:35:29.333 --> 01:35:34.666
- Go back to the hospital, miss...
- There are children dying of thirst!

01:35:34.833 --> 01:35:36.457
Evacuate where?

01:35:36.583 --> 01:35:39.457
They're going to kill us all,
can't you get it?

01:35:39.583 --> 01:35:42.291
- To the other side.
- How, on a bicycle?

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:43.874
Dinghies.

01:35:44.083 --> 01:35:46.749
- Please.
- Please leave!

01:35:53.250 --> 01:35:54.166
Commander...

01:35:56.958 --> 01:35:58.666
Nobody here wants to surrender.

01:35:59.750 --> 01:36:03.374
Let the hospital evacuate.
We're staying here to the end.

01:36:08.250 --> 01:36:10.999
The cease-fire ends in two minutes!

01:36:11.167 --> 01:36:12.791
Hurry up, people!

01:36:15.042 --> 01:36:16.082
There's no more time.

01:36:16.792 --> 01:36:19.249
Let the wounded through.

01:36:19.583 --> 01:36:21.541
I feel sorry for you boys.

01:36:27.250 --> 01:36:29.582
They've knocked down the whole city.

01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.582
Stop pushing.

01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:34.082
Hurry up, people!
Cease-fire's about to end.

01:36:35.333 --> 01:36:36.832
Our people, back to the quarters!

01:36:46.625 --> 01:36:47.874
Lusia!

01:36:48.042 --> 01:36:50.999
Take her, I'll be back in a sec.

01:36:51.292 --> 01:36:53.999
Ladybird, the cease-fire ends
in a moment!

01:37:04.250 --> 01:37:06.457
Back together, like sisters, eh?

01:37:09.625 --> 01:37:12.249
It will all go back to normal soon?

01:37:13.583 --> 01:37:16.291
And the likes of you will end up
with the likes of him...

01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:19.082
and the likes of me
will serve you coffee in cafÃ©s.

01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:23.332
You're a nobody,

01:37:25.125 --> 01:37:29.166
a common whore who left her detail behind
to protect your pretty ass.

01:37:32.250 --> 01:37:33.582
I hate you.

01:37:38.875 --> 01:37:41.541
Everyone to the house.
The firing starts in a minute!

01:37:47.500 --> 01:37:48.541
Success?

01:37:48.833 --> 01:37:51.291
What are you asking about, exactly?
Got some water?

01:37:55.375 --> 01:37:58.291
Black, the evacuation
of the hospital is complete.

01:37:58.500 --> 01:38:01.249
The personnel and the patients
are now by the river.

01:38:02.083 --> 01:38:05.124
Good. And now we need
the bloody dinghies to show up.

01:38:05.292 --> 01:38:06.749
The red armada!

01:38:18.875 --> 01:38:20.749
The others are by the river! Come!

01:38:21.083 --> 01:38:22.582
Get out of here!

01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:23.541
Get up!

01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:24.624
Beata!

01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.249
I'm staying!

01:38:29.042 --> 01:38:32.041
Take off that armband
of his at least, miss.

01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:36.666
- When they find us, they'll kill us.
- Leave me alone. Please.

01:38:37.292 --> 01:38:38.374
Please.

01:38:58.333 --> 01:38:59.749
Leave me alone!

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:02.249
I'm telling ya!

01:39:03.625 --> 01:39:05.249
Go.

01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:08.332
- Don't leave me alone!
- Go.

01:39:09.250 --> 01:39:10.749
I love you!

01:39:17.750 --> 01:39:23.291
Don't hide, you're all gonna die.
I'll tell them who you are anyway.

01:39:31.042 --> 01:39:33.124
- Is it over?
- All clear.

01:39:33.750 --> 01:39:36.666
No, it's just begun!
Gentlemen, let's go!

01:39:41.458 --> 01:39:42.791
Move it!
Go, go!

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.666
- Some candy, here!
- What about the dinghies?

01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:17.582
What dinghies!?
We're staying here anyway.

01:40:17.583 --> 01:40:17.749
What dinghies!?
We're staying here anyway.

01:40:25.375 --> 01:40:26.041
Don't shoot.

01:40:26.958 --> 01:40:29.541
Don't shoot, I'm German.

01:40:31.542 --> 01:40:34.082
Johann Krauss,
the 2nd unit of the Wachtregiment.

01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:42.957
The Poles have looked after me well,
they didn't harm me in any way.

01:40:48.250 --> 01:40:49.582
Am I hurting any of them?

01:40:54.500 --> 01:40:57.457
All I'm asking is whether
there are any bandits here.

01:41:00.958 --> 01:41:02.582
You? You're a bandit?

01:41:05.625 --> 01:41:08.499
I am an old bandit!

01:41:10.625 --> 01:41:12.666
I've been married twice!

01:41:18.583 --> 01:41:20.582
Shut your mug and get the hell out!

01:41:31.125 --> 01:41:31.999
A goliath!

01:41:32.125 --> 01:41:34.666
Shoot at the cable, guys!
Get the PIAT ready.

01:41:48.083 --> 01:41:49.791
Miki, no way!
Spider, the PIAT!

01:42:21.250 --> 01:42:24.791
The Warsaw men are nice guys!

01:42:26.875 --> 01:42:27.624
Spider!

01:42:32.167 --> 01:42:32.957
They're coming!

01:42:43.583 --> 01:42:44.624
Grenade!

01:42:54.542 --> 01:42:55.541
Grenade!

01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:00.874
Ammo!

01:43:03.583 --> 01:43:04.999
Ammo!

01:43:13.583 --> 01:43:14.332
Grenade!

01:43:14.500 --> 01:43:15.832
Weapon!

01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:17.249
Ammo!

01:43:19.292 --> 01:43:20.999
Man, what's the matter?!

01:43:26.875 --> 01:43:28.499
On the right!

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.457
- Ammo!
- There's none left.

01:43:38.583 --> 01:43:40.082
Give me some weapon!

01:43:40.250 --> 01:43:43.124
- We've none left!
- Damn it!

01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:46.249
Anything!

01:43:47.958 --> 01:43:49.166
There's none left!

01:43:55.167 --> 01:43:58.666
- Everyone to the right!
- Ewa, grenades!

01:44:03.833 --> 01:44:05.791
A cannon!
Everybody get down!

01:44:24.958 --> 01:44:26.499
Ewa!

01:45:03.875 --> 01:45:06.666
We have to retreat! A Panther...

01:45:06.833 --> 01:45:08.499
Retreat!

01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:24.749
The last one.

01:45:29.250 --> 01:45:30.874
What are you wearing?
Take that off!

01:45:32.583 --> 01:45:35.666
You wanna surrender?
Why did you put it on?

01:45:38.375 --> 01:45:40.499
Go on! Shoot!

01:45:40.750 --> 01:45:41.999
What was all this for?

01:45:42.375 --> 01:45:45.332
- Huh?
- I don't want to die! Understand?!

01:45:49.667 --> 01:45:51.499
What's going on here?

01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:55.999
- Give the VIS back!
- Calm down, man! The VIS!

01:46:00.792 --> 01:46:03.374
There are two rounds left.
Pull yourself together!

01:46:07.625 --> 01:46:09.082
Don't you lose it, miss!

01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:11.374
Move it, move it!

01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:24.999
We've got to get through
to the river!

01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:32.082
I'll lead you out, I swear.

01:46:33.792 --> 01:46:35.582
I'll lead you out, I swear, get up!

01:46:35.875 --> 01:46:37.582
Miki, get up!

01:46:38.083 --> 01:46:39.999
Get up! I'll lead you out!

01:46:42.792 --> 01:46:44.457
Crybaby!

01:46:49.083 --> 01:46:50.249
Goral!

01:46:51.375 --> 01:46:53.082
I've left the helmet.

01:46:57.750 --> 01:46:58.499
Let's go.

01:46:59.542 --> 01:47:02.624
Move forward.
Go on!

01:47:05.083 --> 01:47:05.999
Krauts!

01:48:50.958 --> 01:48:53.332
Now just to reach the river!

01:49:54.125 --> 01:49:55.499
Let's get to the river, please.

01:50:00.667 --> 01:50:01.499
Get up.

01:50:02.458 --> 01:50:03.457
Come on, get up!

01:50:07.292 --> 01:50:08.499
I'm sorry.

01:50:10.833 --> 01:50:12.499
For what?

01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:14.874
- Sorry!
- Stop it!

01:50:19.250 --> 01:50:20.749
I'm sorry.

01:50:22.167 --> 01:50:23.082
Get up!

01:50:26.625 --> 01:50:28.666
She stayed at the hospital.

01:50:52.500 --> 01:50:53.374
Stefan, run!

01:50:54.792 --> 01:50:56.374
Hey, gentlemen!

01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:57.999
I'm here!

01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.457
You're all invited to my birthday!

01:51:00.583 --> 01:51:04.666
I turned 19 a few hours ago,
seriously!

01:51:07.125 --> 01:51:09.457
I never thought
this would be how I spend it!

01:51:15.875 --> 01:51:17.582
You're such idiots!

01:51:19.583 --> 01:51:22.957
You can't kill everybody, suckers,
it's just impossible.

01:51:25.333 --> 01:51:26.457
I feel sorry for you!

01:51:29.458 --> 01:51:31.666
The world will remember you for it,
forever!

01:51:33.500 --> 01:51:34.957
Stefan, run!

01:51:38.500 --> 01:51:40.166
Why aren't you hitting harder?!

01:51:43.875 --> 01:51:46.749
Long live freedom, you motherfuckers!

01:52:28.542 --> 01:52:31.166
Hush, hush...

01:55:30.333 --> 01:55:31.999
What have we got here?

01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:10.999
All clear!

01:56:11.305 --> 01:56:17.493
