WEBVTT

00:07.633 --> 00:09.051
is waking.

00:09.135 --> 00:10.302
But there will be one
who can stand against him.

00:10.386 --> 00:11.721
[Lan] Where next?

00:11.804 --> 00:12.930
The Two Rivers.

00:13.013 --> 00:14.265
There are rumors
of four ta'veren there,

00:14.348 --> 00:16.058
all the right age.

00:16.142 --> 00:17.685
[screams]

00:17.768 --> 00:19.562
[Egwene] Nynaeve.

00:19.645 --> 00:21.063
She thinks I'll be able
to listen to the wind

00:21.147 --> 00:22.481
if I work with her.

00:22.565 --> 00:24.942
It's a lonely life,
being a Wisdom.

00:25.025 --> 00:27.361
- I love you.
- I know.

00:28.821 --> 00:31.031
- Do you hear that?
- [distant roaring]

00:31.115 --> 00:33.117
It sounds wrong.

00:33.200 --> 00:34.493
[roaring]

00:34.577 --> 00:36.203
[screaming]

00:36.287 --> 00:37.955
[roars]

00:38.038 --> 00:39.540
[gasps]

00:43.669 --> 00:46.088
[Rand] You show up.
Then these things the next day.

00:46.172 --> 00:48.007
[Moiraine] They're here
for the same reason as I am.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.634
The Dragon has been born again.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.970
And it's one of you.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.221
We leave now.

00:55.765 --> 00:57.016
[roaring]

01:00.060 --> 01:02.062
[chatter in distance]

01:04.064 --> 01:06.066
[raven cawing]

01:06.150 --> 01:07.943
[horse neighs]

01:08.027 --> 01:10.029
[leaves rustling]

01:14.200 --> 01:16.202
[horses neighing]

01:26.337 --> 01:28.214
[horse neighs loudly]

01:51.862 --> 01:54.156
From the Lord, Captain.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.950
For your victory today.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.244
May you always walk
in the Light, sir.

02:02.748 --> 02:04.583
Have you ever tried this?

02:09.296 --> 02:12.383
[squishing, crunching]

02:12.466 --> 02:14.093
[moans]

02:14.176 --> 02:16.136
Mmm.

02:25.229 --> 02:28.440
There's a brutality to the dish.

02:29.483 --> 02:31.944
Because the flavor
doesn't come only from the bird.

02:32.027 --> 02:34.321
- [groaning softly]
- Its bones and beak and feet

02:34.405 --> 02:37.157
cut the inside of your mouth.

02:37.241 --> 02:39.243
Not so much that it hurts.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.579
Just enough that you bleed.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.416
[chuckles softly]

02:48.836 --> 02:51.463
[breathing heavily]

02:51.547 --> 02:53.674
Don't be afraid, girl.

02:53.757 --> 02:55.676
An Aes Sedai should know,

02:55.759 --> 02:57.177
above all others,

02:57.261 --> 03:01.473
that, sometimes,
brutality is the only path

03:01.557 --> 03:03.475
to mercy.

03:12.276 --> 03:14.945
[groaning]

03:27.833 --> 03:30.878
[shouting]

05:03.012 --> 05:04.263
[horse neighs]

05:04.346 --> 05:05.973
[Lan] Hyah!

05:09.935 --> 05:11.186
How much time?

05:11.270 --> 05:12.771
Not enough.

05:12.855 --> 05:14.440
Then we need to move faster.

05:14.523 --> 05:15.482
- [Lan] Hyah!
- Run!

05:15.566 --> 05:17.526
- Hyah!
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

05:17.609 --> 05:19.361
Come on! Come on!

05:22.406 --> 05:23.741
[snarling]

05:23.824 --> 05:24.992
[roars]

05:37.504 --> 05:39.506
[snarling]

05:47.014 --> 05:49.641
[spurring horses]

05:49.725 --> 05:50.893
Come on!

05:51.894 --> 05:53.896
[snarling]

05:58.609 --> 05:59.985
Draw rein.

06:00.069 --> 06:01.445
The town's just up there.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.489
Would it not be a good idea
to head inside some walls?

06:03.572 --> 06:05.699
Walls won't stop Trollocs.

06:05.783 --> 06:07.451
The only thing they fear
is deep water.

06:07.534 --> 06:10.079
No wonder they smell like piss.
[groans]

06:13.082 --> 06:14.666
[Master Hightower] Well,
you've woken me then.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.752
We need to cross the Taren,
immediately.

06:16.835 --> 06:18.337
Of course, mistress. Of course.

06:18.420 --> 06:21.048
My son will be here soon,
and then we can...

06:22.341 --> 06:24.510
Twice that when we're safely
on the other side.

06:26.887 --> 06:29.431
- [distant roaring]
- Have I not made myself clear?

06:30.974 --> 06:34.686
You're not the type of woman
that hears no often?

06:34.770 --> 06:36.063
I am not.

06:36.146 --> 06:38.857
[Lan] Come. Quickly now.

06:42.402 --> 06:44.404
[grunting]

06:50.244 --> 06:52.204
- [horse neighs]
- [grunting]

06:55.457 --> 06:57.251
[roaring]

06:57.334 --> 06:58.627
[gasps]

07:00.087 --> 07:02.673
[snarling, roaring]

07:14.726 --> 07:15.853
[screeches]

07:17.104 --> 07:19.982
- [growling]
- [screeching]

07:25.737 --> 07:28.907
[snarling, roaring]

07:30.534 --> 07:32.536
[panting]

07:33.579 --> 07:35.581
[snarling in distance]

07:39.251 --> 07:41.253
[low growling]

08:01.398 --> 08:03.609
[horse neighs]

08:13.827 --> 08:15.078
[horse neighs]

08:15.162 --> 08:17.372
[panting]

08:22.544 --> 08:23.587
[Fade screeching]

08:23.670 --> 08:26.131
[Trollocs screeching]

08:30.636 --> 08:33.472
[snarling, growling]

08:35.682 --> 08:38.185
What-what are they?

08:38.268 --> 08:39.811
Servants of the Dark.

08:39.895 --> 08:41.563
The riders of Fade.

08:41.647 --> 08:43.649
A Fade can force a Trolloc
to do most things,

08:43.732 --> 08:44.942
but they won't cross that river.

08:45.025 --> 08:48.070
Come, we'll take you safely
to the next town.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.405
What? No. No! My family!

08:50.489 --> 08:53.033
- [Lan] There's no going back
now, master.
- My son is on his way already.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.451
He'll be there in a moment.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.828
You have to help me!
We can't leave him!

08:56.912 --> 08:57.955
If you go back,

08:58.038 --> 08:59.957
you'll give them a way
to follow us.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.833
- I can't allow it.
- [grunts]

09:03.001 --> 09:04.419
[rope splashes]

09:19.351 --> 09:21.103
[Master Hightower] No. No!

09:21.186 --> 09:24.106
It's the only way
to get my son across!

09:26.108 --> 09:28.902
The Whitecloaks are right.

09:28.986 --> 09:30.153
You Aes Sedai,

09:30.237 --> 09:32.406
you're monsters!

09:32.489 --> 09:34.283
- [Lan] Stop!
- [Egwene] Don't!

09:43.208 --> 09:46.253
[shouting, panting]

09:49.881 --> 09:52.342
[shouting]

09:52.426 --> 09:54.344
[screaming]

09:55.512 --> 09:56.638
We need to help him. He's...

09:56.722 --> 09:57.889
He's gone.

10:02.894 --> 10:04.563
[Trollocs snarling in distance]

10:09.067 --> 10:11.403
This will slow them,
not stop them.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.488
We can lose them before
they reach another crossing,

10:13.572 --> 10:15.198
but we need to move fast.

10:15.282 --> 10:16.533
- [Egwene] Come on.
- [Perrin] Come on.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.660
Let's go.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.970
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

10:45.270 --> 10:46.980
- [horse snorting]
- We've lost them.

10:47.064 --> 10:49.316
Come, we'll find a place
to rest while we can.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.735
Be careful, everyone.
There are things more dangerous

10:51.818 --> 10:53.945
than Trollocs in this world.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.948
[birds singing]

11:01.453 --> 11:02.371
[horse snorts]

11:02.454 --> 11:05.332
[nickering]

11:05.415 --> 11:06.958
[exhales]

11:10.128 --> 11:11.588
[horse nickers]

11:12.714 --> 11:14.800
They need their strength.

11:14.883 --> 11:16.259
So do you.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.474
[Mat] Just imagine
if Nynaeve was here.

11:22.557 --> 11:26.812
She'd spend every waking moment
disagreeing with the Aes Sedai.

11:26.895 --> 11:29.314
She'd make Moiraine's life
utter misery.

11:29.398 --> 11:31.233
I saw it.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.777
Nynaeve get taken.

11:33.860 --> 11:35.153
One of those things
just picked her up

11:35.237 --> 11:37.531
and tossed her away
like she was nothing.

11:38.824 --> 11:40.867
Something that quick,

11:40.951 --> 11:42.911
I promise you,
she didn't feel a thing.

11:44.746 --> 11:46.623
[Rand] We need a plan.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.709
You saw what Moiraine did
to the ferryman.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.503
What happens to us
if we step out of line?

11:51.586 --> 11:53.213
What happens if she's right?

11:53.296 --> 11:55.674
If one of us is the, uh...

11:55.757 --> 11:57.384
the Dragon Reborn?

11:57.467 --> 11:59.719
The most powerful channeler
that ever lived?

11:59.803 --> 12:01.888
Moiraine said
the Trollocs came for us.

12:01.972 --> 12:04.057
And when we left,
they did follow us.

12:04.141 --> 12:06.810
Come on. Who even knows
what the truth is?

12:06.893 --> 12:09.020
They say the last Dragon
broke the world,

12:09.104 --> 12:11.189
but the next one will save it.

12:11.273 --> 12:14.276
Well, I heard
the Dragon's gonna have wings.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.735
Looking around at you lot,

12:15.819 --> 12:17.195
I don't see a feather.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.990
Forget what you've heard
about the Dragon.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.659
For she or he will be all
of those things

12:22.742 --> 12:23.994
and none of them.

12:24.077 --> 12:26.163
Now sleep.
You're going to need it.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.540
We leave at first light.

12:43.013 --> 12:45.015
[footsteps approaching]

12:47.934 --> 12:49.769
[exhales]

13:10.624 --> 13:12.375
[sniffs, grunts]

13:12.459 --> 13:14.211
[Moiraine] It's all right.

13:23.553 --> 13:25.889
Come.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.349
Sit.

13:32.896 --> 13:35.357
Are you going to kill us,
like you did that ferryman?

13:36.399 --> 13:38.109
What do you know
of the Three Oaths?

13:38.193 --> 13:40.612
Uh...

13:40.695 --> 13:42.489
they're the promises

13:42.572 --> 13:43.907
made by the Aes Sedai

13:43.990 --> 13:45.992
to end Artur Hawkwing's siege
of the White Tower.

13:46.076 --> 13:48.119
And what are they?

13:48.203 --> 13:49.454
To not kill,

13:49.538 --> 13:52.666
- to not lie.
- Exact verbiage.

13:52.749 --> 13:55.585
Words are important, and how
we use them is important.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.546
I don't know.

13:57.629 --> 13:59.089
One,

13:59.172 --> 14:01.841
to speak no word
that is not true.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.385
Two, to make no weapon

14:03.468 --> 14:06.054
with which one person
may kill another.

14:06.137 --> 14:07.556
Three,

14:07.639 --> 14:10.267
never to use the One Power
as a weapon,

14:10.350 --> 14:13.144
except in the last
extreme defense of her life

14:13.228 --> 14:15.313
or the life of her Warder

14:15.397 --> 14:17.774
or another Aes Sedai.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.068
These oaths are bound
by the One Power itself.

14:20.151 --> 14:21.820
It's not
that we do not break them,

14:21.903 --> 14:23.989
it's that we cannot break them.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.741
I did not kill that ferryman.

14:26.825 --> 14:29.411
He wasted his own life
on a foolish cause.

14:29.494 --> 14:30.996
He was just trying
to get to his family.

14:31.079 --> 14:34.416
If I had allowed him to take
his ferry and cross the river,

14:34.499 --> 14:36.167
what would have happened?

14:36.251 --> 14:37.877
[howling in distance]

14:37.961 --> 14:39.129
The Trollocs
would have killed him.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.630
Yes. And then?

14:40.714 --> 14:42.591
- Followed us.
- Exactly.

14:43.633 --> 14:45.760
The Power inside you

14:45.844 --> 14:47.345
is the smallest part
of your strength.

14:47.429 --> 14:50.932
It's your mind
and how you use it

14:51.016 --> 14:53.727
that will mean much more
in the battles to come.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.729
The Power inside me?

14:55.812 --> 14:58.148
What do you call it?

14:58.231 --> 15:02.527
This skill that Wisdoms have
to predict the weather?

15:05.113 --> 15:07.449
- They listen to the wind.
- You see,

15:07.532 --> 15:09.909
women all over the world
have different names for it.

15:09.993 --> 15:12.579
But it's the same thing.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.540
It's the same thing
for all of us.

15:15.624 --> 15:17.375
One thing.

15:17.459 --> 15:19.294
One Power.

15:19.377 --> 15:22.380
And women like you and I,

15:22.464 --> 15:24.758
we are lucky enough
to be able to touch it.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.301
I'm no Aes Sedai.

15:26.384 --> 15:27.594
But you could be.

15:28.637 --> 15:30.138
Touching the Source
will come to you

15:30.221 --> 15:31.806
whether you want it to or not.

15:41.524 --> 15:42.859
Look at the stone.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.614
Look at its surface.

15:47.697 --> 15:50.533
It's clear and opaque,

15:50.617 --> 15:52.952
like the water of a river.

15:53.995 --> 15:56.956
Imagine yourself floating
in that river.

15:57.040 --> 15:59.000
[water splashing softly]

15:59.084 --> 16:01.670
As the water moves,

16:01.753 --> 16:03.880
let it take you.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.590
No thoughts.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.218
Just let yourself drift.

16:08.301 --> 16:11.137
Clear your mind of everything.

16:11.221 --> 16:13.515
- There are no woods.
- [breathing deeply]

16:13.598 --> 16:15.100
There is no hunger,

16:15.183 --> 16:16.685
no exhaustion.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.687
There is only the stone

16:18.770 --> 16:21.106
and the sound of rushing water.

16:21.189 --> 16:23.441
- [water rushing]
- Let it take you.

16:24.693 --> 16:25.860
Surrender.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.738
Let yourself drift.

16:28.822 --> 16:30.407
[water splashing]

16:30.490 --> 16:32.283
Drift.

16:32.367 --> 16:33.785
[gasps]

16:34.786 --> 16:35.912
[exhales]

16:35.995 --> 16:37.497
I thought...

16:38.498 --> 16:40.917
I-I thought I felt something,
but...

16:41.000 --> 16:42.627
Those first two,

16:42.711 --> 16:44.587
those were mine.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.923
That last, that was yours

16:47.006 --> 16:48.466
and yours alone.

16:50.927 --> 16:53.555
You don't listen to the wind,
Egwene.

16:54.764 --> 16:57.642
It's the wind
that listens to you.

17:07.068 --> 17:09.070
[insects trilling]

17:25.670 --> 17:27.172
[exhales softly]

17:33.678 --> 17:35.680
[exhales]

17:45.482 --> 17:46.941
[inhales sharply]

17:47.025 --> 17:48.943
[grunting]

17:49.027 --> 17:50.612
- Sorry. I...
- It's all right.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.281
I just, uh...

17:55.325 --> 17:58.453
I-I came out here to be alone.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.125
Egwene, I...

18:04.209 --> 18:05.960
It's all right.

18:06.044 --> 18:07.295
I understand.

18:11.382 --> 18:13.384
[footsteps receding]

18:28.233 --> 18:30.151
[inhales deeply]

18:30.235 --> 18:31.486
[exhales]

18:32.529 --> 18:34.531
[exhales]

18:34.614 --> 18:37.951
[groaning]

18:38.034 --> 18:40.370
[breathing heavily]

18:42.372 --> 18:43.832
- [Perrin] Laila!
- [Laila] Perrin!

18:43.915 --> 18:45.291
[Egwene] Perrin.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.168
[footsteps approaching]

18:47.252 --> 18:48.253
Are you all right?

18:50.296 --> 18:51.756
[grunts softly]

18:57.846 --> 18:59.764
[grunting softly]

18:59.848 --> 19:01.933
[howling in distance]

19:02.016 --> 19:03.768
[grunts]

19:06.354 --> 19:08.189
[sniffles]

19:10.942 --> 19:13.194
Do you think we'll ever go back?

19:13.278 --> 19:14.571
Home?

19:20.702 --> 19:22.537
No.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.711
[exhales]

19:33.631 --> 19:35.300
[grunts]

19:36.467 --> 19:38.219
[sighs]

19:39.721 --> 19:40.889
[exhales]

19:40.972 --> 19:42.599
[coughs]

19:44.475 --> 19:47.270
[coughing]

19:47.353 --> 19:50.440
[grunts, coughs softly]

19:50.523 --> 19:52.734
[coughs, clears throat]

19:56.112 --> 19:57.906
[coughs]

20:01.618 --> 20:03.328
[gags]

20:03.411 --> 20:05.496
[coughs]

20:05.580 --> 20:07.665
[gagging, retching]

20:14.255 --> 20:16.883
[gasps, panting]

20:22.347 --> 20:24.349
[panting]

20:37.236 --> 20:39.238
[panting]

20:46.454 --> 20:48.748
[gasping]

20:51.960 --> 20:54.337
[breathing heavily]

20:54.420 --> 20:57.924
[indistinct chatter]

20:58.007 --> 20:59.008
No.

21:01.344 --> 21:03.346
- How did...
- You saw them, too.

21:03.429 --> 21:05.348
But it was a dream.

21:09.227 --> 21:11.145
Did you do this?

21:11.229 --> 21:13.314
Did you put this in our dreams?!

21:17.026 --> 21:19.237
[Moiraine] Who saw this?

21:20.655 --> 21:22.073
Who? All of you?

21:23.324 --> 21:24.367
What did you see?

21:24.450 --> 21:25.576
[Mat] Bats.

21:25.660 --> 21:27.662
Their necks just snapped.

21:27.745 --> 21:29.247
Right in midair.

21:29.330 --> 21:32.166
Like someone had them
in their hands.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.710
I could feel the crack.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.379
Was there anyone in your dream?

21:36.462 --> 21:38.131
Did anyone speak to you?

21:38.214 --> 21:40.216
There was a man.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.926
Eyes like embers.

21:42.969 --> 21:44.220
He didn't say anything though.

21:44.303 --> 21:47.515
If this happens again,
you tell me straight away.

21:47.598 --> 21:49.892
Dreams have power.

21:51.185 --> 21:52.437
More than you know.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.230
What does that mean?

21:54.313 --> 21:55.231
Come.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.357
The horses are rested.

21:56.441 --> 21:57.942
No, no, no. No!

21:58.026 --> 22:00.028
[wings flapping]

22:03.031 --> 22:04.365
Where are we going?!

22:05.366 --> 22:07.118
East.

22:07.201 --> 22:08.745
To the river crossing
at Whitebridge.

22:08.828 --> 22:09.996
And then?

22:10.079 --> 22:11.956
And then to the White Tower.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.458
I've told you this.

22:13.541 --> 22:14.584
And then what?!

22:14.667 --> 22:17.503
Why should we trust you?!

22:17.587 --> 22:20.214
There's a place for Egwene,
maybe.

22:20.298 --> 22:23.134
But what does a man do
at the White Tower?

22:23.217 --> 22:25.803
Other than become an errand boy
for the Aes Sedai.

22:26.846 --> 22:27.805
Go where you will then.

22:27.889 --> 22:29.390
See, how come
I don't believe

22:29.474 --> 22:30.725
you'd actually let me do that?

22:30.808 --> 22:33.436
I've run out of patience.

22:33.519 --> 22:34.645
And time.

22:34.729 --> 22:35.730
[horse neighs]

22:37.398 --> 22:38.858
- [Lan] Hah!
- [horse neighs]

22:41.903 --> 22:43.362
[Mat] Well...

22:43.446 --> 22:45.406
you got a reaction out of her.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.241
Happy?

22:47.325 --> 22:48.826
Suit yourself.

22:50.828 --> 22:52.830
[saddle jangling]

22:54.749 --> 22:55.917
One conversation,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.420
one conversation
and you're on her side now?

22:59.504 --> 23:02.381
What did she promise you
last night?

23:02.465 --> 23:04.509
That you're the one?

23:04.592 --> 23:06.135
Come on, do you really think

23:06.219 --> 23:07.637
she's any better
than what's chasing us?!

23:07.720 --> 23:09.806
Of course I do!

23:09.889 --> 23:12.433
Those monsters
killed Nynaeve and Laila

23:12.517 --> 23:14.811
and half the people
we've ever loved.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.105
Moiraine has done nothing
but protect us,

23:17.188 --> 23:18.856
try to keep us safe.

23:18.940 --> 23:21.275
Don't you see how pale
she's getting, how weak?

23:21.359 --> 23:22.819
She's using the One Power

23:22.902 --> 23:25.947
to keep our strength up
at the cost of her own.

23:26.030 --> 23:27.949
And she does it,

23:28.032 --> 23:31.452
even with you being
the stubborn bastard you are.

23:33.162 --> 23:34.956
If I were her,
I'd leave you behind, too.

23:36.124 --> 23:37.959
You already did.

23:39.710 --> 23:41.087
[horse sputters]

23:41.170 --> 23:42.964
[horse neighs]

23:43.047 --> 23:44.590
Don't be an ass.

23:44.674 --> 23:45.591
[horse sputtering]

23:45.675 --> 23:47.301
We've got each other. That's it.

23:47.385 --> 23:50.638
You're right.
You're right about Moiraine.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.474
She's not doing any of this
for our benefit.

23:53.558 --> 23:56.227
She's got a reason
she's keeping us all alive.

23:56.310 --> 23:57.854
And, soon as that reason's gone,

23:57.937 --> 23:59.480
we're as good as dead.

24:00.523 --> 24:01.482
Till then,

24:01.566 --> 24:03.192
the lady does shoot fireballs,

24:03.276 --> 24:04.944
so let's try... [grunts]

24:05.027 --> 24:07.196
and stay on her good side.

24:07.280 --> 24:08.865
Coming?

24:12.994 --> 24:14.412
[horse sputters]

24:17.498 --> 24:18.875
[horse sputters]

24:23.212 --> 24:24.297
[horse neighs]

24:25.464 --> 24:26.382
[horse neighs]

24:26.465 --> 24:27.925
Hyah!

24:30.052 --> 24:31.179
Whitecloaks.

24:31.262 --> 24:32.180
[horse snorting]

24:32.263 --> 24:33.598
[horse nickering]

24:38.186 --> 24:40.146
[Moiraine] Do not speak
unless spoken to.

24:40.229 --> 24:43.649
And try to answer any question
as truthfully as you can.

24:43.733 --> 24:46.110
Do not mention the White Tower
or Aes Sedai.

24:46.194 --> 24:48.821
I am a lady from a fallen house.

24:48.905 --> 24:50.406
You are under my care.

24:51.407 --> 24:53.034
[horse neighs]

24:53.117 --> 24:55.119
[Whitecloaks
chattering indistinctly]

24:57.830 --> 24:59.749
[horse neighs]

24:59.832 --> 25:01.542
[chatter continues]

25:03.502 --> 25:04.587
Good afternoon.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.006
[horses snorting]

25:07.089 --> 25:10.635
If you would be so kind
as to dismount your horses.

25:10.718 --> 25:12.303
[horse neighs]

25:12.386 --> 25:14.055
[horse sputters]

25:17.016 --> 25:19.060
Are you headed to Whitebridge?

25:19.143 --> 25:21.395
Yes, sir.
I have a sister in the city

25:21.479 --> 25:24.523
who we... hope will let us stay.

25:24.607 --> 25:27.568
It's a dangerous time
to be on the road.

25:27.652 --> 25:29.487
War in the south.

25:29.570 --> 25:32.990
The Aes Sedai heading in force
from the White Tower.

25:33.074 --> 25:35.451
Wars and witches
don't concern us, sir.

25:36.494 --> 25:37.662
We are just hoping to find

25:37.745 --> 25:39.163
a safe place to settle
for the night,

25:39.247 --> 25:40.164
before the light fades.

25:40.248 --> 25:41.999
Best be on your way then.

25:42.083 --> 25:44.001
[horse snorts]

25:44.085 --> 25:46.504
[jangling]

25:46.587 --> 25:47.838
I'm sorry.

25:49.257 --> 25:50.925
If you would indulge here
a moment longer,

25:51.008 --> 25:52.843
we have...

25:52.927 --> 25:54.971
one of the Questioners
with us today.

25:56.013 --> 25:57.014
He will be thorough...

25:58.182 --> 25:59.767
...but brief.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.104
[horses neighing]

26:03.187 --> 26:05.398
All those who seek passage
through our land

26:05.481 --> 26:07.692
must be properly...

26:07.775 --> 26:08.943
questioned.

26:09.026 --> 26:10.278
This isn't your land.

26:10.361 --> 26:12.738
Children of the Light
hold sway

26:12.822 --> 26:15.032
wherever men walk in the Light.

26:15.116 --> 26:16.409
Where did you say you were from?

26:16.492 --> 26:17.660
[Lan] I didn't.

26:17.743 --> 26:19.912
But I am from the Borderlands,
where men know

26:19.996 --> 26:22.415
how to keep their hands
to themselves,

26:22.498 --> 26:24.083
lest they lose them.

26:25.126 --> 26:26.460
[chuckles softly]

26:26.544 --> 26:28.337
Search the horses.

26:28.421 --> 26:30.423
- [soft chatter]
- [horse neighs]

26:32.049 --> 26:34.427
They say the White Tower

26:34.510 --> 26:39.098
dispatched eight Sisters to deal
with Logain's army to the south.

26:40.141 --> 26:41.892
They can't help
but get their fingers

26:41.976 --> 26:43.686
in others' business.

26:43.769 --> 26:46.439
And those others
usually end up dead.

26:48.858 --> 26:49.775
[gasps]

26:49.859 --> 26:51.610
I... Sorry, sir.

26:51.694 --> 26:53.029
I have a wound.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.364
The pain, it...

26:55.448 --> 26:56.949
It's not healing well.

26:57.033 --> 26:58.868
What happened to you?

27:02.163 --> 27:04.915
You wouldn't believe me
if I told you.

27:05.916 --> 27:08.377
It was a monster, sir.

27:08.461 --> 27:10.546
Eight feet tall, with a...

27:10.629 --> 27:11.714
with a mouth like a boar.

27:11.797 --> 27:12.923
It, uh...

27:13.007 --> 27:15.426
A group of them overtook
the village we were in.

27:16.886 --> 27:17.803
This was in the Borderlands?

27:17.887 --> 27:19.722
No, sir. No. West of here.

27:19.805 --> 27:20.973
Near the Mountains of Mist.

27:21.057 --> 27:23.100
Can I see your wound, madam?

27:29.690 --> 27:31.776
Trollocs this far south.

27:32.943 --> 27:35.529
The Dark One's eye
is truly upon us.

27:35.613 --> 27:37.365
What was the name of the town
where you came from?

27:37.448 --> 27:38.908
Taren Ferry.

27:40.201 --> 27:43.120
There were many people
hurt there.

27:43.204 --> 27:44.789
Perhaps you can help them.

27:44.872 --> 27:46.165
Mm.

27:47.416 --> 27:50.378
We Children try to steer clear
of the Aes Sedai where we can.

27:50.461 --> 27:52.129
When you get to Whitebridge,

27:52.213 --> 27:53.798
find one.

27:53.881 --> 27:55.716
Only one of those women
can heal this wound.

27:55.800 --> 27:59.261
- Light be with you.
- [Whitecloak] All clear, sir.

27:59.345 --> 28:01.430
The Light is always with you.

28:01.514 --> 28:03.599
It needs no instruction.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.977
I will not forget your faces
should we meet again.

28:07.061 --> 28:09.438
[horse neighs]

28:09.522 --> 28:12.817
Sir, I will take a contingent
of Questioners south.

28:12.900 --> 28:14.735
The woman said
the Trollocs went west.

28:14.819 --> 28:16.904
You are meant for battle.

28:16.987 --> 28:18.906
We Questioners have a...

28:18.989 --> 28:20.699
higher purpose.

28:25.413 --> 28:26.497
[indistinct shouting]

28:26.580 --> 28:27.957
[horse snorts]

28:45.933 --> 28:47.935
[horse snorting]

28:48.018 --> 28:50.020
[horse sputtering]

28:55.484 --> 28:57.361
You said you couldn't break
the Three Oaths.

28:57.445 --> 28:58.946
I can't.

28:59.029 --> 29:00.364
You did today.

29:00.448 --> 29:01.782
[chuckles softly] I did?

29:01.866 --> 29:03.868
That Whitecloak,
you lied to him.

29:03.951 --> 29:05.119
You can heal that wound.

29:05.202 --> 29:07.204
We can only heal others,

29:07.288 --> 29:08.289
not ourselves.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.499
It's why
we usually travel together.

29:10.583 --> 29:13.502
And you have a sister
in Whitebridge?

29:13.586 --> 29:15.588
All Aes Sedai are my sisters.

29:16.672 --> 29:18.174
We will always tell the truth.

29:18.257 --> 29:21.260
It just may not be the truth
you think you hear.

29:21.343 --> 29:22.928
So listen carefully.

29:24.555 --> 29:27.099
- [horse neighs]
- [spurring horses]

29:36.525 --> 29:38.527
[spurring horses]

29:41.530 --> 29:44.241
[horses neighing]

30:06.263 --> 30:07.473
[horse sputters]

30:07.556 --> 30:09.558
[horse snorting]

30:22.321 --> 30:26.075
[Mat/Egwene]

30:53.352 --> 30:55.729
It's good
to remember Manetheren.

30:55.813 --> 30:58.482
It's just a song.

30:58.566 --> 31:01.110
No idea who Manetheren is,
anyway.

31:01.193 --> 31:06.031
In the Old Tongue, "Manetheren"
means "Mountain Home."

31:06.115 --> 31:09.952
Used to be the name of the place
you now call the Two Rivers.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.538
During the Trolloc Wars,

31:12.621 --> 31:16.208
the army of Manetheren
was small but strong.

31:17.209 --> 31:19.378
A thorn in the Dark One's hand.

31:19.461 --> 31:24.133
So he sent the entirety
of his forces to destroy it.

31:24.216 --> 31:26.552
But when this massive host
arrived,

31:26.635 --> 31:29.888
the women and men of the
Mountain Home stood before it,

31:29.972 --> 31:32.808
the shallowest bend of the river
at their backs,

31:32.891 --> 31:34.518
ready to fight.

31:34.602 --> 31:37.646
Their king, Aemon,
like in the song,

31:37.730 --> 31:39.064
had sent messages

31:39.148 --> 31:40.733
to the neighbors
they'd fought for in the past,

31:40.816 --> 31:43.819
and they were promised aid if
they could hold for three days.

31:44.987 --> 31:46.655
And somehow, they did.

31:46.739 --> 31:48.449
Against that monstrous host,

31:48.532 --> 31:50.034
they held.

31:50.117 --> 31:51.827
For an hour.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.329
Then a second.

31:54.371 --> 31:56.040
Then a third.

31:57.041 --> 31:58.584
For three days, they fought.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.211
And though the land became
a butcher's yard,

32:01.295 --> 32:03.464
no Trolloc crossed the river.

32:05.132 --> 32:06.467
But on the third night,

32:06.550 --> 32:08.969
no help had come.

32:09.053 --> 32:11.472
So they fought on, alone.

32:11.555 --> 32:13.307
For six days.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.809
For nine.

32:15.893 --> 32:18.520
And on the tenth day, they knew.

32:19.563 --> 32:22.066
They knew no help was coming.

32:24.568 --> 32:27.488
From the city, Queen Eldrene
organized her people

32:27.571 --> 32:30.741
to take the children and find
refuge in the mountain keeps.

32:30.824 --> 32:33.535
Though many of them
went not to safety

32:33.619 --> 32:36.914
but to join the army
fighting for their home.

32:36.997 --> 32:41.335
Not a step of ground was given
up until it was soaked in blood.

32:41.418 --> 32:44.505
But on the 13th day...

32:46.173 --> 32:48.842
...the army of Manetheren

32:48.926 --> 32:50.511
was gone.

32:52.638 --> 32:56.809
Queen Eldrene
felt her husband die.

32:56.892 --> 32:59.311
Driven by grief, she reached out

32:59.395 --> 33:03.482
and she hurled the One Power
at the Trolloc army.

33:05.317 --> 33:09.071
A hurricane of fire washed
across the land.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.740
The Dark One's host
ran like beasts,

33:11.824 --> 33:12.908
but they were not fast enough,

33:12.991 --> 33:15.369
for the flames caught them,

33:15.452 --> 33:17.454
consumed them.

33:18.872 --> 33:21.959
But Eldrene had drawn more
of the One Power

33:22.042 --> 33:24.878
than any woman
could ever hope to wield,

33:24.962 --> 33:26.547
and it burnt her right through,

33:26.630 --> 33:28.382
from the inside out.

33:29.758 --> 33:31.844
But the children

33:31.927 --> 33:34.096
and their minders,
hidden in the mountains,

33:34.179 --> 33:35.889
had been saved.

33:35.973 --> 33:38.142
There was nothing left
of their farms,

33:38.225 --> 33:40.978
their villages
or their great city.

33:41.061 --> 33:43.814
But they returned,

33:43.897 --> 33:46.191
and they held the land

33:46.275 --> 33:48.152
that was theirs.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.363
That is why the song says,
"Weep."

33:51.447 --> 33:54.199
"Weep." Weep for Manetheren.

33:54.283 --> 33:57.202
Weep for what is lost forever.

34:00.748 --> 34:03.834
The old blood runs deep in you.

34:03.917 --> 34:05.544
Remember that.

34:07.254 --> 34:10.340
You'll need it
in the days to come.

34:27.733 --> 34:29.651
We can rest here the night.

34:29.735 --> 34:31.945
I haven't seen sign
of Trollocs for days.

34:32.029 --> 34:35.199
Perhaps it's how close
we're skirting Shadar Logoth.

34:35.282 --> 34:36.617
Is that purposeful?

34:39.953 --> 34:41.288
[horse snorting]

34:44.875 --> 34:48.420
[quietly] It is too dangerous
in the shadowed city.

34:48.504 --> 34:50.005
We cannot go there.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.423
That Whitecloak--

34:51.507 --> 34:53.342
you think he's the one
who killed the others?

34:53.425 --> 34:56.303
Did you not see
my sisters' rings?

34:56.386 --> 34:58.847
Seven now.

34:59.848 --> 35:03.101
He's not the only one who met
a face he'll remember today.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.192
Rest.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.860
And, tomorrow, we'll figure out

35:11.944 --> 35:13.862
where to find a Sister
who can heal you.

35:13.946 --> 35:16.365
[horse neighs]

35:16.448 --> 35:18.033
[horse snorts]

35:18.116 --> 35:20.118
- [birds singing]
- [water flowing]

35:35.050 --> 35:37.135
Do you want to talk about it?

35:37.219 --> 35:38.595
About what?

35:38.679 --> 35:39.805
[scoffs] Come on, Rand.

35:39.888 --> 35:41.348
What do you want?

35:42.349 --> 35:45.185
You want me to just go back
to the way everything was?

35:45.269 --> 35:46.270
No. I...

35:46.353 --> 35:47.271
Because we can't.

35:47.354 --> 35:49.231
You made your decision.

35:54.194 --> 35:55.863
You get it, right?

35:57.239 --> 35:59.908
I'm not going to be Nynaeve's
apprentice, because she's dead.

35:59.992 --> 36:01.493
And so is Laila.

36:01.577 --> 36:03.912
And... and here we are,
in the middle

36:03.996 --> 36:05.914
of nowhere, being chased by
the monsters that killed them,

36:05.998 --> 36:07.958
and you won't even look at me.

36:09.960 --> 36:13.046
And I just want you
to look at me.

36:14.089 --> 36:15.632
And not hate me.

36:16.633 --> 36:19.011
I don't need anything more
than that.

36:27.352 --> 36:30.022
I could never hate you.

36:30.105 --> 36:31.982
[sniffles]

36:36.111 --> 36:38.447
[howling in distance]

36:38.530 --> 36:40.073
[exhales]

36:43.619 --> 36:45.454
[groans]

36:46.496 --> 36:48.498
[howling continues]

36:51.168 --> 36:53.128
[groans softly]

36:56.882 --> 36:58.550
[grunts, groans softly]

37:00.302 --> 37:01.637
[hisses]

37:01.720 --> 37:04.222
[groans, hissing]

37:04.306 --> 37:06.516
- [rapid footfalls]
- [gasps]

37:09.311 --> 37:11.229
- [exhales]
- [snarling, barking]

37:13.398 --> 37:15.984
[snarling, howling]

37:18.028 --> 37:20.405
[snarling]

37:23.492 --> 37:25.494
[breathing heavily]

37:38.006 --> 37:40.050
[low growling]

37:46.932 --> 37:48.934
[growling continues]

38:06.326 --> 38:08.328
[howling]

38:15.669 --> 38:17.671
[fire crackling]

38:18.755 --> 38:20.716
[howling in distance]

38:21.717 --> 38:23.719
[wheezing]

38:25.846 --> 38:27.431
Is she going to be all right?

38:29.558 --> 38:31.560
She needs sleep.

38:33.270 --> 38:34.688
You all do.

38:40.652 --> 38:43.280
[Moiraine continues wheezing]

38:50.454 --> 38:52.456
[wind blowing]

38:55.667 --> 38:57.586
[snarling]

38:57.669 --> 38:58.754
[gasping]

38:58.837 --> 39:00.839
[panting]

39:03.675 --> 39:05.427
[groans softly]

39:06.845 --> 39:08.847
[breathing heavily]

39:12.934 --> 39:15.062
- [screeching]
- [gasping]

39:15.145 --> 39:16.188
We have to move. Up. Up.

39:16.271 --> 39:17.647
Wake up. Hurry. They found us.

39:17.731 --> 39:18.565
- [Egwene gasps]
- Moiraine.

39:18.648 --> 39:19.733
You have to wake up, Moiraine.

39:19.816 --> 39:21.276
- [panting]
- [horses sputter, neigh]

39:22.486 --> 39:24.488
- [grunting]
- Hyah!
- Carry her!

39:24.571 --> 39:26.615
She can't move.
We need to get her out of here.

39:26.698 --> 39:27.741
Ride!

39:27.824 --> 39:28.950
- Where?
- East.

39:29.034 --> 39:30.786
To the fallen city
of Shadar Logoth.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.454
- Go! Now!
- [horse neighs]

39:32.537 --> 39:34.790
[spurring horses]

39:34.873 --> 39:36.875
[snarling, screeching]

39:39.044 --> 39:41.505
- [horse neighs]
- [spurring horses]

39:45.759 --> 39:47.719
[snarling]

39:52.766 --> 39:55.477
Hyah! [panting]

39:55.560 --> 39:57.646
[Mat] Hyah!

39:57.729 --> 40:00.524
[snarling]

40:00.607 --> 40:01.525
[neighing]

40:01.608 --> 40:02.692
[gasps]

40:03.985 --> 40:04.903
[grunts]

40:04.986 --> 40:06.988
[snarling]

40:09.157 --> 40:10.492
[roars]

40:11.493 --> 40:12.702
[horses neighing]

40:12.786 --> 40:14.246
[gasping, grunting]

40:14.329 --> 40:16.206
- Whoa. Easy, now.
- [Rand] What's happening?

40:16.289 --> 40:17.999
- Easy, now.
- I don't know.
She just stopped.

40:18.083 --> 40:19.376
[neighing]

40:19.459 --> 40:20.877
Steady. Steady.

40:20.961 --> 40:23.130
- [neighs]
- Bela, come on.

40:23.213 --> 40:25.090
- [neighing]
- [Rand] What is that?

40:26.591 --> 40:28.009
[exhales]

40:36.560 --> 40:37.769
[Perrin] Wait, look!
The Trollocs.

40:37.853 --> 40:39.938
Why are they
all just standing there?

40:40.021 --> 40:42.816
[snarling in distance]

40:46.903 --> 40:49.698
Come. The Trollocs
won't follow us inside.

40:49.781 --> 40:50.824
Hah!

41:08.884 --> 41:10.886
[horses snorting]

41:32.991 --> 41:33.909
Listen.

41:33.992 --> 41:35.994
There's no birds.

41:38.038 --> 41:39.998
There's no bugs.

41:40.081 --> 41:41.917
[horse snorts]

41:42.000 --> 41:43.418
There's nothing.

41:53.386 --> 41:55.096
[grunting]

41:55.180 --> 41:57.349
- She's barely breathing.
- Yeah.

42:04.856 --> 42:07.317
[doors creaking open]

42:10.445 --> 42:11.696
We'll stay here.

42:11.780 --> 42:14.282
[doors creaking closed]

42:24.834 --> 42:26.253
- [exhales]
- [wheezing]

42:26.336 --> 42:29.256
She needs to be kept warm.

42:31.299 --> 42:33.218
[breathing heavily]

42:33.301 --> 42:35.512
- [coughing softly]
- Oh, Moiraine.

42:37.973 --> 42:40.100
Shadar Logoth.

42:40.183 --> 42:42.060
Sounds like the Old Tongue.

42:43.520 --> 42:46.606
It means "Shadow's Waiting."

42:46.690 --> 42:49.276
But it was once called Aridhol.

42:49.359 --> 42:50.944
During the Trolloc Wars,

42:51.027 --> 42:53.571
it was the richest,
most powerful city in the world.

42:53.655 --> 42:55.156
But when the world
needed them most,

42:55.240 --> 42:57.158
they built their wall
with no gate,

42:57.242 --> 42:59.035
locked themselves inside

42:59.119 --> 43:01.204
and let the other nations
of man burn.

43:01.288 --> 43:03.581
It was the people of this city
who promised Manetheren aid.

43:03.665 --> 43:06.584
And they were the ones
who let them die.

43:06.668 --> 43:07.919
When the Trolloc Wars ended,

43:08.003 --> 43:09.129
the survivors came here,

43:09.212 --> 43:11.381
to find food, shelter.

43:11.464 --> 43:13.633
When they knocked,
no one answered.

43:13.717 --> 43:15.218
When they finally broke
through the wall,

43:15.302 --> 43:17.804
there was no one inside.

43:17.887 --> 43:20.056
It is said that evil itself

43:20.140 --> 43:21.933
grew from the city's heart
and consumed everyone

43:22.017 --> 43:24.436
and everything that lived.

43:25.854 --> 43:27.355
Ever since,

43:27.439 --> 43:29.441
the city has been abandoned.

43:29.524 --> 43:32.068
Not even Trollocs will step foot
behind these walls.

43:32.152 --> 43:34.696
[wheezing]

43:35.989 --> 43:37.157
Couple of things.

43:37.240 --> 43:38.908
Um, one, that's...

43:38.992 --> 43:41.161
more words
than you've said all day.

43:41.244 --> 43:42.162
Probably ever.

43:42.245 --> 43:44.080
And, two,

43:44.164 --> 43:46.082
why in Light's name
did you bring us here?

43:47.167 --> 43:48.335
Touch nothing.

43:48.418 --> 43:50.712
Eat only the food you brought.

44:03.683 --> 44:05.352
[exhales]

44:10.023 --> 44:11.858
- [horse snorts]
- [exhales]

44:13.777 --> 44:15.779
[soft neighing]

44:26.122 --> 44:28.124
[neighing, snorting]

44:56.569 --> 44:58.571
[sighs]

45:53.460 --> 45:54.878
[exhales]

46:00.175 --> 46:01.593
You should have this.

46:04.637 --> 46:06.639
Laila made it.

46:10.059 --> 46:11.978
She always said
she didn't make weapons;

46:12.061 --> 46:13.771
she made tools.

46:15.231 --> 46:17.984
And that I'd probably use it
a thousand times for...

46:18.067 --> 46:19.736
chopping apples
or whittling wood

46:19.819 --> 46:21.571
before I ever needed it to...

46:21.654 --> 46:23.364
defend myself.

46:25.950 --> 46:28.036
But to keep it sharp...

46:28.119 --> 46:31.456
[sniffs] keep it clean,
so that if I ever...

46:31.539 --> 46:34.375
did need it... [exhales]

46:34.459 --> 46:36.461
it'd be ready.

46:47.055 --> 46:48.806
A tool though,

46:48.890 --> 46:50.767
still.

46:50.850 --> 46:53.937
To save my life...

46:55.355 --> 46:58.358
...or the life
of someone that I loved.

47:04.155 --> 47:06.407
And she thought that would
probably be you.

47:08.826 --> 47:11.496
Since she seemed to think if...

47:11.579 --> 47:13.831
you ever got into any trouble,
it would...

47:13.915 --> 47:16.084
probably be my fault.

47:17.085 --> 47:19.254
Although,
to be perfectly honest,

47:19.337 --> 47:20.338
can't see how anyone

47:20.421 --> 47:22.006
could reasonably blame me
for any of this.

47:22.090 --> 47:23.591
[chuckles]

47:23.675 --> 47:25.009
[sniffles]

47:30.723 --> 47:32.767
[sniffles]

47:32.850 --> 47:33.851
Thank you.

47:39.357 --> 47:41.526
The girls are gonna be fine.

47:42.735 --> 47:44.445
My parents will be over
at yours,

47:44.529 --> 47:45.905
checking on them.

47:45.989 --> 47:47.240
Rand's and Egwene's, too.

47:47.323 --> 47:49.200
[chuckles softly]

47:50.702 --> 47:52.537

48:02.171 --> 48:04.882

50:15.012 --> 50:17.348
[whispering voices resume]

50:18.391 --> 50:20.518
[voices stop]

50:20.601 --> 50:23.187
- [slithering nearby]
- [sniffs]

50:23.271 --> 50:25.440

50:30.987 --> 50:33.531

50:47.420 --> 50:48.796
[Egwene] No! No, wait!

50:48.880 --> 50:49.881
[neighing]

50:49.964 --> 50:52.467
It's all right. I'm here.

50:52.550 --> 50:54.177
Where are we?

50:56.095 --> 50:58.765
You've killed us all.

50:58.848 --> 51:00.266
[grunting]

51:00.349 --> 51:02.226
[screeching]

51:05.813 --> 51:06.856
[gasping]

51:10.485 --> 51:11.402
What in Light's name?

51:11.486 --> 51:13.237

51:13.321 --> 51:15.281
[screeching]

51:15.364 --> 51:17.450
Go!

51:17.533 --> 51:19.327
I'll find you.

51:19.410 --> 51:22.038
[Mat] Come on! Rand, let's go!

51:22.121 --> 51:24.373

I'll slit your throat.
