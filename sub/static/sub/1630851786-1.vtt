YOU HAVE ZERO MATCHES

05:34.291 --> 05:39.375
SERGEANT WALDEMAR

05:42.000 --> 05:45.041
-Hello?
-Why aren't you picking up when I call?

05:45.833 --> 05:48.625
I… didn't hear. What's up?

05:48.708 --> 05:52.458
On your way to work, get two hot dogs.

05:52.541 --> 05:54.583
-And something to drink.
-Okay.

05:54.666 --> 05:59.750
One with mustard and ketchup,
one with Thousand Island.

06:00.458 --> 06:02.958
Okay. Anything else?

06:03.041 --> 06:04.041
No, that's it.

06:04.541 --> 06:06.041
So I'll be there--

07:02.166 --> 07:03.416
GROCERY STORE

07:03.500 --> 07:04.458
Morning.

07:16.125 --> 07:17.083
Morning.

07:23.666 --> 07:25.750
Two bottles of orange juice

07:25.833 --> 07:28.875
and two hot dogs.
One with ketchup and mustard, one…

07:29.500 --> 07:32.166
with… Seven Island dressing and…

07:33.333 --> 07:34.541
I'll pack it myself.

07:49.208 --> 07:50.375
How much is it?

07:54.416 --> 07:55.666
Twenty zlotys.

08:01.291 --> 08:02.833
Why the fuck are you here?

08:03.666 --> 08:04.500
Out!

08:23.000 --> 08:24.750
Here's that 20 zlotys.

08:29.375 --> 08:30.375
One more thing.

08:30.458 --> 08:33.583
There is this Animal Rights Protection Act

08:33.666 --> 08:38.000
of August 1997.

08:38.083 --> 08:41.541
If I see you kick your dog
or whatever one more time,

08:41.625 --> 08:43.541
I'll take you to the precinct.

08:43.625 --> 08:46.416
Got it? We'll see there how brave you are.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.666
Get the fuck out.

08:59.333 --> 09:06.333
POLICE

09:20.083 --> 09:21.500
Howdy.

09:21.583 --> 09:25.000
-Hey.
-I bought you orange juice.

09:27.583 --> 09:29.208
I don't drink orange juice.

09:32.666 --> 09:33.666
Oh, right.

10:59.083 --> 11:02.875
RESTROOM

11:05.375 --> 11:06.375
Howdy.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.916
-I've got the groceries--
-Bring them in.

11:34.666 --> 11:36.500
One with mustard and ketchup.

11:37.208 --> 11:38.333
Seven Island.

11:39.916 --> 11:41.958
Two bottles of orange juice.

11:46.250 --> 11:47.125
From today?

11:47.958 --> 11:49.208
It was made today.

11:54.958 --> 11:56.375
What happened here?

11:57.291 --> 11:59.125
Something went down last night?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.333
Who's in the cells?

12:04.916 --> 12:07.041
Sarge, can you tell me anything?

12:08.250 --> 12:11.875
Yesterday, the girl came here.

12:12.708 --> 12:14.583
The one in the cell.

12:15.500 --> 12:18.166
All dirty, covered in blood,

12:18.250 --> 12:21.250
and visibly fucked up in the eyes.

12:21.333 --> 12:26.458
Started saying some shit
about meteors or meteorites.

12:26.541 --> 12:29.208
And that all her friends were dead,

12:29.291 --> 12:32.791
killed by some fat murderers.

12:32.875 --> 12:35.375
And that she killed
the fatties in revenge.

12:35.458 --> 12:39.583
Supposedly, killed one with a machete,
and ran the other one over with a car.

12:39.666 --> 12:43.333
"Supposedly," as the fatties
are locked up here too.

12:43.416 --> 12:46.041
So we went there to that cabin.

12:46.125 --> 12:49.583
And indeed, there was a fat guy there,

12:49.666 --> 12:51.208
so we busted him.

12:51.958 --> 12:54.083
Less than an hour later,

12:54.166 --> 12:57.958
Mariusz and his brother
brought in the other fat guy,

12:58.041 --> 13:00.458
because they ran into him on their way.

13:01.875 --> 13:06.250
And now… we have a few corpses.

13:07.708 --> 13:11.041
Including a policeman
from a nearby municipality.

13:12.666 --> 13:15.250
This shit doesn't add up.

13:16.875 --> 13:18.666
Do you understand any of this?

13:25.333 --> 13:26.333
Wow.

13:26.416 --> 13:27.375
Wow, indeed.

13:30.291 --> 13:32.791
Should we call the regional headquarters?

13:32.875 --> 13:35.250
What if I already have?

13:35.333 --> 13:36.708
You called regional?

13:36.791 --> 13:39.875
Metropolitan. You have
a fucking problem with me?

13:39.958 --> 13:44.000
No, just asking.
Good that you called the Metropolitan.

13:46.833 --> 13:48.083
What did they say?

13:49.458 --> 13:53.125
That they will send
special forces from the capital.

13:53.625 --> 13:54.625
Special forces?

13:55.375 --> 13:58.791
Yeah, fucking special forces.
Don't you know what they are?

13:59.958 --> 14:01.958
I know they're special forces…

14:04.458 --> 14:06.583
-When are they coming?
-I don't know.

14:06.666 --> 14:09.125
Tonight or in the morning.

14:09.208 --> 14:13.833
It's some archbishop's birthday.
The ministers are there,

14:13.916 --> 14:17.208
and the special forces
are protecting those ministrants.

14:17.291 --> 14:24.291
HIS MIDDLE NAME IS POWER

14:27.208 --> 14:29.166
What else do you want to know?

14:30.750 --> 14:33.458
You and Wanessa
managed to arrest the fat guys?

14:33.541 --> 14:35.541
-Yeah.
-They're huge.

14:35.625 --> 14:37.500
A few blows with a baton,

14:37.583 --> 14:40.833
a jolt with a taser,
and they're running like clockwork.

14:57.875 --> 14:58.875
Hey.

15:02.166 --> 15:03.166
Want a sip?

15:04.500 --> 15:05.708
It's water.

15:14.666 --> 15:15.708
I'm Adam.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.000
I'm a constable here.

15:21.208 --> 15:22.083
Yeah.

15:23.625 --> 15:24.625
Zosia.

15:26.166 --> 15:27.250
I heard.

15:29.750 --> 15:30.666
Thanks.

15:33.250 --> 15:37.333
If you need anything,
you can always call on me.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.750
Lock up later. Come on.

15:43.750 --> 15:44.750
Get up.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.500
Turn around. Hands.

15:48.500 --> 15:49.750
What's going on?

15:49.833 --> 15:51.375
We're doing a field visit.

15:54.333 --> 15:55.291
Come on.

15:55.375 --> 15:56.375
Lock up.

16:23.875 --> 16:25.416
Listen.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.416
Give me the interrogation notes.

16:28.083 --> 16:29.333
And my cap.

16:30.666 --> 16:34.000
When you're done with the report,
send it to Warsaw.

16:34.083 --> 16:36.625
Should I come with you?
Maybe I could help.

16:36.708 --> 16:38.708
No. Finish the report and go home.

16:38.791 --> 16:39.791
Come on.

16:45.291 --> 16:48.875
GOD, HONOR, HOMELAND

17:36.125 --> 17:38.541
Please go in. Now, please.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.833
Please go in. What did I say?

17:40.916 --> 17:41.916
In, please.

17:42.708 --> 17:43.666
Please!

17:45.958 --> 17:49.375
We're in here and you're going to tell me
exactly what happened.

17:49.458 --> 17:51.000
From the very beginning.

17:52.291 --> 17:54.458
Who got here first, who was last?

17:54.958 --> 17:58.791
How did you all get out?
What did you touch or take?

17:58.875 --> 18:02.291
And when did you go down to the cellar?

18:03.375 --> 18:04.375
Go.

18:05.666 --> 18:06.541
Miss Iza,

18:07.333 --> 18:09.416
our guide, went in first.

18:10.125 --> 18:12.583
"Miss Iza first."

18:13.250 --> 18:15.583
Okay. Where did the machete come from?

18:16.250 --> 18:21.833
And the knife your friend
was stabbed in the stomach with?

18:21.916 --> 18:24.333
Jurek? Julek.

18:33.041 --> 18:34.041
Well?

18:39.625 --> 18:41.291
Oh, my. Turn around.

18:41.375 --> 18:42.875
Turn around!

18:48.333 --> 18:50.333
Sit down. Sit!

18:53.000 --> 18:54.000
I'll be--

18:54.916 --> 18:56.083
I'll be right back.

20:35.750 --> 20:36.750
Fuck.

20:51.625 --> 20:52.625
Fuck.

21:09.750 --> 21:10.583
Hello?

21:12.000 --> 21:13.000
Hello?

21:16.000 --> 21:17.375
Zosia, for fuck's sake!

22:39.125 --> 22:40.666
-Thanks.
-You're welcome.

23:01.791 --> 23:03.625
It's odd they're not back yet.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.000
Isn't it?

23:11.250 --> 23:12.416
Call Waldek.

23:22.250 --> 23:23.625
This is the voicemail--

23:26.333 --> 23:27.416
It's switched off.

23:28.250 --> 23:30.375
Or maybe there's no reception there.

23:33.041 --> 23:34.458
I'll try the radio.

23:38.958 --> 23:42.208
Sgt. Waldek, Adam Adamiec here.

23:43.000 --> 23:44.500
Please come in. Over.

23:52.333 --> 23:55.250
Sgt. Waldek,
come in immediately. It's Adam here.

23:56.166 --> 23:57.166
Over.

24:08.250 --> 24:10.750
Sgt. Waldek, is everything okay? Over.

24:20.458 --> 24:21.625
He's not answering.

24:24.750 --> 24:26.708
All right, maybe take a ride there.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.541
I'd rather not go alone.

24:32.250 --> 24:34.125
I'm not done with the report yet.

24:34.791 --> 24:36.750
Then I'll wait for you.

24:37.833 --> 24:39.166
Fucking hell.

24:40.916 --> 24:43.583
Wanessa, why are you getting upset?

24:43.666 --> 24:45.916
There are some safety rules, right?

24:46.000 --> 24:51.750
Like, there is this article
in the health and safety regulations…

24:53.041 --> 24:54.250
Move your ass.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.833
Flashers on? I'm turning them on.

25:35.958 --> 25:37.291
And today you…

25:44.000 --> 25:45.458
You look nice.

25:48.375 --> 25:49.375
Just saying.

26:18.916 --> 26:19.916
Light my way.

26:34.458 --> 26:35.708
Sarge?

26:38.291 --> 26:39.291
Waldek?

26:47.208 --> 26:48.208
Waldek?

27:07.708 --> 27:09.291
What?

27:12.083 --> 27:13.291
Oh, Jesus Christ!

27:24.333 --> 27:25.958
Oh, no, no…

27:34.083 --> 27:36.708
Let's go back to the station. Come on.

27:36.791 --> 27:37.875
Leave me alone!

27:40.625 --> 27:41.541
Wanessa.

27:42.500 --> 27:44.166
Remember what Waldek said?

27:44.958 --> 27:47.333
Special forces are coming, right?

27:47.416 --> 27:50.666
Let's go back, wait for them,
and come back with them.

27:50.750 --> 27:52.708
-Come, now.
-You're such a wimp!

27:54.125 --> 27:55.000
Wimp?

27:56.458 --> 27:59.666
They're not coming until late
or even in the morning.

27:59.750 --> 28:03.208
You know what will happen by morning?
More people will die.

28:03.291 --> 28:05.541
Get a grip, we are the police!

28:05.625 --> 28:07.791
We can't wait for backup and hide

28:07.875 --> 28:10.375
when that murderous cunt
is running around.

28:10.458 --> 28:11.791
We have to catch her!

28:11.875 --> 28:13.458
But why? What for?

28:13.541 --> 28:17.000
For fuck's sake! The handcuffs are here,
she isn't. Sarge is dead.

28:17.083 --> 28:19.125
Adaś, use your fucking brain!

28:19.708 --> 28:20.583
That's our job.

28:20.666 --> 28:23.416
Our duty. Remember the oath you took?

28:23.500 --> 28:26.750
"To protect the community,
even if it means risking our lives."

28:26.833 --> 28:30.666
But my oath doesn't matter.
Waldek has been fucking split in half.

28:30.750 --> 28:34.083
You can't just do whatever,
this isn't Miami Vice. Come on!

28:34.166 --> 28:37.291
-We'll wait for them and come back--
-Don't touch me!

28:38.416 --> 28:39.416
Sorry.

28:40.333 --> 28:43.583
But… it's dark and we're alone.

28:43.666 --> 28:45.125
We can't handle this.

28:47.625 --> 28:48.916
We are not alone.

28:53.625 --> 28:55.625
There's the Territorial Defense.

29:00.333 --> 29:02.541
According to the cards, I see it's…

29:04.000 --> 29:08.000
It's not just your legs. I reckon
this is something much, much worse.

29:08.083 --> 29:10.666
I reckon this could even be a brain tumor.

29:10.750 --> 29:14.500
Jesus! So I guess I should see a doctor.

29:15.375 --> 29:18.625
No, absolutely not,
no need to see a doctor.

29:19.416 --> 29:20.958
Let me tell you, Jarosław,

29:21.041 --> 29:25.333
if you go to my website,
www.psychicpablo.pl,

29:25.416 --> 29:30.125
there are special ointments I've made
with the best herbs, with ginseng…

29:30.208 --> 29:31.291
Will you get that?

29:31.375 --> 29:35.833
…and bamboo leaves,
which are the best for all ailments.

29:36.666 --> 29:38.625
I see. Well, thank you very much.

29:38.708 --> 29:43.833
I also wanted to ask
about my feet as sometimes they hurt.

29:43.916 --> 29:47.041
According to the cards,
it could also be your spine.

29:48.875 --> 29:49.875
Hello?

29:58.958 --> 29:59.958
Okay.

30:01.541 --> 30:03.000
Gear up for action.

30:30.708 --> 30:32.500
People used to be more human.

30:33.333 --> 30:34.625
In the analog times.

30:36.458 --> 30:37.458
And now?

30:38.833 --> 30:42.625
All that technology
has made us so freaking lonely.

30:42.708 --> 30:43.875
Freaking lonely!

30:44.916 --> 30:46.166
And frustrated.

30:47.125 --> 30:51.583
All people do is spend time
on the internet, cell phones, computers,

30:51.666 --> 30:52.916
commenting on others.

30:53.500 --> 30:56.125
This is now the most popular sport.

30:56.208 --> 30:58.458
Online hate!

30:58.541 --> 30:59.791
Fucking hell.

31:00.750 --> 31:03.958
No more values,
feelings, tenderness. Nothing.

31:04.833 --> 31:08.375
Back in the day,
there was your word, respect. And now?

31:10.125 --> 31:12.041
We're at each other's throats.

31:12.125 --> 31:17.166
Throats! In texts, on messengers… Fuck!

31:17.250 --> 31:18.666
Fucking hell.

31:20.166 --> 31:24.333
And if you don't add an emoji,
someone gets fucking offended

31:24.416 --> 31:28.958
because they don't get your joke
or your fucking intention!

31:31.916 --> 31:33.125
That's just sick.

31:34.958 --> 31:36.375
The world got sick.

31:37.625 --> 31:38.875
But I will cure it.

31:40.208 --> 31:42.041
That's why I set up this camp.

31:43.208 --> 31:45.541
Because I don't agree with any of this.

31:46.291 --> 31:47.750
Adrenaline!

31:49.791 --> 31:52.000
Yes. That's the truth.

31:53.583 --> 31:54.916
No two ways about it.

31:58.166 --> 32:01.333
What's this? Are your kids playing pranks?

32:02.125 --> 32:04.333
How could they? The camp is empty.

32:05.416 --> 32:06.750
They're out on a trip.

32:07.875 --> 32:10.000
It might be a fuse or short circuit.

32:10.541 --> 32:12.541
By the way, that leopard print…

32:14.541 --> 32:15.875
I'll be right back!

32:16.416 --> 32:17.416
Hurry up.

32:18.916 --> 32:20.041
Fucking hell.

32:32.416 --> 32:33.416
Robert?

32:48.416 --> 32:49.625
Oh, fuck.

33:00.208 --> 33:01.500
Fuck me.

33:10.666 --> 33:11.666
Fuck!

33:20.166 --> 33:22.000
Fuck me.

34:59.750 --> 35:00.750
We're here.

35:09.958 --> 35:11.958
She ran that way. Over there.

35:12.041 --> 35:14.166
That's where the offline camp is.

35:14.708 --> 35:18.458
How do you know she ran straight ahead
and didn't turn left or right?

35:18.541 --> 35:21.291
-Stay out of it.
-We'll follow the tracks.

35:21.375 --> 35:22.625
We know our stuff.

35:23.625 --> 35:24.541
Let's go.

35:25.791 --> 35:28.416
Courage, brotherhood, responsibility.

35:28.500 --> 35:31.708
-That's who we fucking are.
-#Territorials.

35:41.916 --> 35:43.875
No, it makes no sense.

35:43.958 --> 35:45.541
Move it! That's an order.

35:49.500 --> 35:53.916
Wanessa, following a killer
into the woods is a death wish.

35:55.875 --> 35:57.541
Bad career choice?

35:57.625 --> 35:59.333
Yes, apparently it was!

35:59.416 --> 36:01.125
What the fuck was I thinking?

36:02.125 --> 36:05.750
We should have three,
five, ten times more guys for this.

36:07.791 --> 36:08.833
And a helicopter!

36:10.000 --> 36:11.166
Shut up!

36:12.416 --> 36:13.541
And a searchlight!

36:23.458 --> 36:24.833
Quiet, for fuck's sake!

36:33.500 --> 36:35.041
She was here. Bear trap.

36:38.333 --> 36:39.333
Light.

36:40.875 --> 36:45.666
When our fugitive friend
gets caught in this, there is no way out.

36:46.708 --> 36:50.250
But how do you know
she will be coming back through here?

36:50.333 --> 36:52.541
If she gets lost, she'll come back here.

36:52.625 --> 36:54.750
And it'll either be us, or the trap.

36:54.833 --> 36:59.666
Wolves often watch the hunter,
surround him,

36:59.750 --> 37:01.958
and then follow his tracks.

37:02.041 --> 37:06.166
He thinks he's following the wolf,
but it's the wolf following him.

37:06.708 --> 37:08.416
And that's when traps…

37:10.208 --> 37:11.375
are awesome.

37:11.875 --> 37:13.625
Yeah, but she's not a wolf.

37:13.708 --> 37:17.416
What do you know about field work,
hunting, tracking? Nothing.

37:17.500 --> 37:20.458
Set up the trap. Twenty meters east.

37:23.458 --> 37:24.458
Adaś.

37:28.416 --> 37:31.958
If you don't have anything smart to say,
keep your mouth shut.

37:32.041 --> 37:33.708
You're annoying.

37:46.083 --> 37:53.083
Thirteen, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.

37:53.166 --> 37:54.000
Twenty.

39:06.458 --> 39:07.458
Men.

39:08.333 --> 39:09.208
Mariusz?

39:09.875 --> 39:10.875
Sławek?

39:13.166 --> 39:14.166
Sławek!

39:26.916 --> 39:30.083
Jesus Christ, Sławek.

39:31.583 --> 39:32.791
Holy fuck.

39:32.875 --> 39:35.000
-Sit down, here.
-What?!

39:35.083 --> 39:36.291
Sit him down.

39:36.375 --> 39:38.166
-Sit!
-What?

39:38.250 --> 39:40.250
-Here, sit down.
-Oh, fuck!

39:40.333 --> 39:44.208
Jesus, man, you have no…
We need to… wrap it somehow.

39:47.458 --> 39:49.458
All right, hold it. There.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.666
Jesus, no!

39:52.750 --> 39:54.666
No, no, no…

39:55.875 --> 39:59.083
That's it, we're going back. You hear me?

39:59.166 --> 40:00.791
I'm calling an ambulance.

40:00.875 --> 40:04.500
But aren't we closer to the camp now?

40:05.125 --> 40:07.666
-What? I don't know.
-Same distance. Maybe closer.

40:09.458 --> 40:11.375
-Sławcio!
-Hello?

40:11.458 --> 40:13.791
Officer Adamiec from Baranowo speaking.

40:13.875 --> 40:17.625
We have a colleague here
with two severed hands--

40:17.708 --> 40:19.250
To the camp Adrenaline.

40:19.333 --> 40:21.458
-Yes, to the camp.
-Stay awake.

40:21.541 --> 40:23.541
To the camp called "Adrenaline."

40:23.625 --> 40:24.541
Yes, thank you.

40:24.625 --> 40:28.083
-Okay, ambulance is coming.
-Quick, pick him up.

40:28.166 --> 40:30.250
-Help him.
-Okay, let's go.

40:30.333 --> 40:32.583
-Here, help your brother!
-Here, quick.

40:32.666 --> 40:33.666
And up.

40:34.416 --> 40:36.833
-Where is Mariusz? Where is he?
-I'm here.

40:36.916 --> 40:39.625
Take them, maybe they'll sew them back on.

41:07.541 --> 41:09.125
There it is!

41:09.208 --> 41:12.041
Hold on, brother.
Soon you'll be in the hospital.

41:16.666 --> 41:17.666
Hello?

41:30.333 --> 41:31.333
Oh, fuck!

41:34.625 --> 41:35.625
Now what?

41:35.708 --> 41:37.125
What are we gonna do?

41:37.208 --> 41:38.416
Hush! Let me think.

41:38.500 --> 41:40.625
"Think"? My brother is dying!

41:40.708 --> 41:42.541
I know! Fuck.

41:42.625 --> 41:46.541
There should be a first aid kit.
With a red cross on it.

41:46.625 --> 41:47.833
Shut up!

41:47.916 --> 41:50.625
I'm the only person here
who knows what to do.

41:50.708 --> 41:52.916
So do something about my brother.

41:54.166 --> 41:56.291
-Hold on, brother.
-Shut your mouth!

41:56.375 --> 41:57.916
I'm talking to my brother!

42:18.916 --> 42:21.375
-What was that?
-Back to the cabin, quick!

42:21.458 --> 42:24.166
Get inside the cabin! Open it!

42:29.666 --> 42:30.666
Fuck!

42:33.333 --> 42:35.041
There! Put him over there.

42:38.416 --> 42:40.083
Here.

42:40.166 --> 42:41.083
Careful.

42:41.166 --> 42:42.041
Here.

42:46.375 --> 42:50.333
Hold on, brother, you'll make it.
You have my word. Just hold on.

42:52.125 --> 42:53.958
Quick! Put something under his head.

42:59.125 --> 43:00.333
Let's lay him down.

43:00.416 --> 43:01.291
Yeah.

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
Adaś.

43:04.083 --> 43:04.916
Careful.

43:10.875 --> 43:13.000
What was that? What did you see?

43:15.208 --> 43:16.208
Adaś!

43:18.250 --> 43:20.916
It was her. That girl, Zosia.

43:22.208 --> 43:24.833
But she looked like…

43:26.458 --> 43:27.541
Like…

43:27.625 --> 43:28.541
Like what?

43:28.625 --> 43:30.958
Like the fat guys in the cell.

43:31.041 --> 43:34.125
And…

43:34.208 --> 43:35.041
And what?

43:37.375 --> 43:38.375
I don't know.

44:28.666 --> 44:29.666
Hold it.

44:48.416 --> 44:49.458
Janeczka?

44:53.666 --> 44:55.125
Wanessa!

44:56.583 --> 44:58.041
What are you doing here?

45:00.333 --> 45:01.625
Adaś…

45:02.250 --> 45:04.666
Listen, I was with Oliwier.

45:04.750 --> 45:08.333
Suddenly, the light went out
and he went to check.

45:08.416 --> 45:11.375
And I heard something like…

45:11.458 --> 45:14.041
I don't know what the hell it was.

45:14.125 --> 45:17.458
I got scared and I didn't know what to do.

45:17.541 --> 45:21.166
I got into this closet
and I've been here for an hour.

45:21.833 --> 45:23.250
Hi, Mariusz.

45:25.000 --> 45:26.583
Hello, Janeczka.

46:03.125 --> 46:04.125
Sławek?

46:05.958 --> 46:07.375
He's not breathing.

46:10.625 --> 46:11.625
Sławek?

46:13.833 --> 46:14.833
Sławcio.

46:56.208 --> 46:59.083
-I'm taking Sławek home.
-What do you mean, home?

47:00.916 --> 47:03.000
-In the ambulance.
-You're not.

47:03.083 --> 47:06.083
Nobody goes out.
Let's wait for the cavalry.

47:06.166 --> 47:07.291
What cavalry?

47:08.541 --> 47:11.083
Special forces are coming
from the capital.

47:12.041 --> 47:14.833
I was just thinking
we should call the police.

47:15.500 --> 47:18.125
But you're the police,
so who would we call?

47:18.208 --> 47:20.666
They're coming late or in the morning.

47:20.750 --> 47:23.125
-Waiting makes no sense.
-Nothing does!

47:23.750 --> 47:26.791
-I'm going back. Adaś, help me.
-You can't go!

47:26.875 --> 47:28.708
We have to finish what we started.

47:28.791 --> 47:31.166
Finish what? My brother is fucking dead!

47:31.250 --> 47:34.291
Who's to blame for that?
Don't you want to kill her?

47:34.375 --> 47:36.833
We're armed and trained.

47:37.625 --> 47:39.791
-We have the advantage.
-So far we don't.

47:39.875 --> 47:41.666
What advantage?

47:41.750 --> 47:44.666
Let's barricade ourselves
and sit tight till morning.

47:44.750 --> 47:46.875
-Fine policeman you are.
-Responsible--

47:46.958 --> 47:48.916
Not responsible, you're a pussy!

47:50.916 --> 47:51.750
Okay, I'm off.

47:51.833 --> 47:53.708
-No!
-You're not going anywhere.

47:53.791 --> 47:57.458
-Don't tell me what to do!
-I'm the police. Stop that nonsense.

47:57.541 --> 48:01.875
-Crybabies, both of you.
-Guys, let's not fight, okay?

48:01.958 --> 48:03.958
How about we mind our own business?

48:04.041 --> 48:06.416
How about we listen
to the highest-ranked officer?

48:06.500 --> 48:08.791
Please, you're just a senior constable!

48:08.875 --> 48:11.750
We need to speak with one voice.

48:11.833 --> 48:15.125
We need to agree during a crisis.

48:15.208 --> 48:19.083
-Rise above any division, understand?
-Exactly.

48:20.375 --> 48:22.458
-Look, what a smart-ass whore.
-Hey!

48:23.041 --> 48:24.500
Don't call me a smart-ass!

48:24.583 --> 48:27.291
-I call things what they are.
-I'm not a thing.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.416
I am a whore, but a liberated one.

48:30.500 --> 48:32.708
And you? Who are you?

48:32.791 --> 48:34.458
A Polish patriot,

48:34.541 --> 48:36.708
with a swastika on your chest.

48:36.791 --> 48:38.333
-Moron.
-I may be a moron…

48:39.750 --> 48:41.666
But at least I don't have HIV!

48:41.750 --> 48:43.375
I don't have HIV.

48:43.458 --> 48:45.416
And you have a small dick!

48:45.500 --> 48:47.000
-What did you say?
-You heard me.

48:47.083 --> 48:48.916
Stop it, all of you!

48:49.000 --> 48:50.625
No!

48:51.291 --> 48:53.333
No! Come on!

48:54.500 --> 48:55.708
People!

48:57.000 --> 48:58.500
What are you doing?

49:00.583 --> 49:03.416
To survive, we have to stick together.

49:03.500 --> 49:05.708
Janeczka is 100% right about that.

49:05.791 --> 49:08.875
If we get divided, if we split up,

49:08.958 --> 49:11.958
if everyone goes their own way,
one left, one right,

49:12.041 --> 49:14.916
you take the ambulance,
you who knows what, then…

49:15.625 --> 49:17.291
we will all die!

49:19.500 --> 49:22.208
-Show some…
-Manners!

49:23.000 --> 49:24.208
Empathy, that's it.

49:27.125 --> 49:28.375
Empathy.

49:33.875 --> 49:35.000
All right, I'm sorry.

49:38.375 --> 49:40.666
Me too. It's actually not that small.

49:42.291 --> 49:43.125
Sorry.

49:46.791 --> 49:48.791
Well, I'm sorry too.

49:49.708 --> 49:50.625
And…

49:51.625 --> 49:53.791
from now on we stay together, yes?

49:56.875 --> 50:01.041
We are here. Ambulance is here.
Here is the big tree. Here, the tents.

50:01.625 --> 50:02.458
Here's the plan.

50:02.541 --> 50:05.000
We take strategic positions.

50:05.541 --> 50:08.041
Me by the cafeteria.
Adaś, on top of the ambulance.

50:08.125 --> 50:12.166
Mariusz, you go inside the tent.
We lay low. And wait.

50:12.250 --> 50:14.791
These are good vantage points.

50:14.875 --> 50:17.541
We wait, with the bait
in the middle, in full view.

50:17.625 --> 50:19.416
Classic police setup.

50:20.083 --> 50:22.250
And when that bitch appears,

50:22.333 --> 50:25.791
the bait takes cover
and we catch her in the crossfire.

50:26.708 --> 50:28.416
And that's it, case closed.

50:31.000 --> 50:33.958
I know, you'd rather hide
and wait for rescue like a pussy.

50:34.041 --> 50:36.083
-And if she doesn't come?
-She will.

50:36.166 --> 50:37.291
How do you know?

50:37.375 --> 50:39.458
I can feel it. Cop's hunch, okay?

50:41.333 --> 50:43.000
Trust me, it will work.

50:45.500 --> 50:47.666
So I'm here, Adaś there.

50:48.791 --> 50:49.791
You here.

50:51.375 --> 50:52.625
Crossfire.

50:54.791 --> 50:56.333
But who will be the bait?

51:03.291 --> 51:04.291
No.

51:05.166 --> 51:06.583
No, out of the question.

51:07.791 --> 51:09.083
Over my dead body.

52:12.750 --> 52:14.125
Sorry, that was me!

53:13.500 --> 53:14.666
Janeczka.

53:16.250 --> 53:17.375
Where are you going?

53:18.666 --> 53:20.083
I can't see Mariusz.

53:20.166 --> 53:21.666
Stay where you are.

53:21.750 --> 53:24.250
Shut up! Go back to your position.

53:51.666 --> 53:52.583
Wanessa!

53:54.291 --> 53:55.541
Wanessa!

53:57.875 --> 53:59.166
Mariusz!

54:07.041 --> 54:08.000
Wanessa!

54:10.625 --> 54:13.458
-What are you doing?
-Leave it!

54:13.541 --> 54:16.458
-Don't shoot blindly!
-Let's chase her!

54:16.541 --> 54:19.541
-Let me go! What are you doing? Prick!
-That's it!

54:27.916 --> 54:31.625
Didn't I fucking say
to barricade ourselves and sit tight?

54:31.708 --> 54:33.708
No one ever fucking listens to me.

54:33.791 --> 54:36.333
Why? "Adaś? That pussy doesn't know shit."

54:36.416 --> 54:38.666
"A cop's hunch"? "Police setup"?

54:38.750 --> 54:40.250
There goes your setup!

54:40.333 --> 54:42.416
Janeczka and Mariusz, fuck!

54:43.791 --> 54:45.333
Mariusz is dead too?

54:45.416 --> 54:48.333
If he weren't, he would help us somehow.

54:48.416 --> 54:50.958
He'd fucking react, open fire.

54:51.041 --> 54:53.916
You are just… all talk.

54:54.000 --> 54:57.291
A hothead. A cobra in a skirt.

54:57.375 --> 55:00.083
The Messiah of the Polish Police.
What did it get us?

55:00.166 --> 55:03.666
-Fucking nothing!
-Stop yelling at me already!

55:03.750 --> 55:07.458
Everybody is dead.
Don't you understand? And we're next!

55:19.416 --> 55:20.416
I'm sorry.

55:26.750 --> 55:28.750
All right, I'm sorry too.

55:30.458 --> 55:33.708
The thing is,
I'd like to live a bit longer.

55:34.500 --> 55:36.208
And for you to live also.

55:37.958 --> 55:38.958
Okay?

55:40.916 --> 55:41.916
Okay.

55:43.083 --> 55:44.125
We can't do that.

55:44.208 --> 55:47.000
We have to be
more fucking reasonable, okay?

56:01.583 --> 56:02.791
I'm sorry.

1:01:57.708 --> 1:01:58.708
Hi.

1:02:09.541 --> 1:02:11.166
What is happening to me?

1:02:15.750 --> 1:02:19.458
How come I know
how to speak this language?

1:02:22.166 --> 1:02:24.375
I will explain everything to you.

1:02:47.833 --> 1:02:50.333
Officer Kowalczyk here, over.

1:02:51.708 --> 1:02:53.000
Do you copy?

1:02:53.791 --> 1:02:55.875
Come in at once, I'm fucking begging you!

1:02:55.958 --> 1:02:58.291
Sgt. Waldek is dead, everybody is dead.

1:02:59.958 --> 1:03:01.791
Can anyone fucking hear me?

1:03:14.458 --> 1:03:16.708
It was a piece of the Moon

1:03:17.541 --> 1:03:20.208
that once fell from the sky.

1:03:22.833 --> 1:03:25.041
Its element of Evil oozed from the rock

1:03:25.125 --> 1:03:27.250
and went inside me.

1:03:28.916 --> 1:03:31.166
And now it's also inside you.

1:03:34.291 --> 1:03:36.625
That's more or less what happened.

1:03:39.291 --> 1:03:42.083
Now we are the bad guys.

1:03:45.375 --> 1:03:48.041
We are monsters.

1:03:49.166 --> 1:03:50.958
We kill people.

1:03:54.750 --> 1:03:56.666
Wow.

1:04:00.958 --> 1:04:05.791
And why do we kill?

1:04:06.791 --> 1:04:08.750
Well, because we are monsters.

1:04:10.875 --> 1:04:12.583
That's not really

1:04:13.458 --> 1:04:16.833
a complex motivation.

1:04:21.833 --> 1:04:23.458
That's our nature.

1:04:25.041 --> 1:04:26.041
Instinct.

1:04:26.833 --> 1:04:30.083
With every minute
you'll feel it and understand it more.

1:04:30.958 --> 1:04:32.958
And you will rediscover yourself.

1:04:33.750 --> 1:04:35.458
It's cool, you will see.

1:04:37.791 --> 1:04:40.291
Besides, Evil is a subjective notion.

1:04:41.625 --> 1:04:42.708
People are evil.

1:04:43.333 --> 1:04:47.541
They have it ingrained in their nature.

1:04:48.750 --> 1:04:52.166
Their species
should have been annihilated ages ago.

1:04:54.291 --> 1:04:55.375
And we

1:04:56.916 --> 1:05:00.291
will fix that and kill them.

1:05:02.125 --> 1:05:05.125
Because we both hate people.

1:05:09.250 --> 1:05:10.250
But…

1:05:11.375 --> 1:05:15.333
they can't all be evil.

1:05:18.125 --> 1:05:22.250
The world is a good place too.

1:05:23.583 --> 1:05:24.583
The world?

1:05:26.166 --> 1:05:28.291
Was the world ever good to you?

1:05:33.041 --> 1:05:34.583
It wasn't good to me.

1:06:22.833 --> 1:06:24.125
Are you okay?

1:06:29.708 --> 1:06:31.125
I think so.

1:06:37.541 --> 1:06:39.625
And now…

1:06:41.250 --> 1:06:42.958
do I also have your strength?

1:06:44.625 --> 1:06:48.208
Do I have any special powers?

1:06:59.125 --> 1:07:00.750
So…

1:07:02.333 --> 1:07:03.541
what now?

1:07:06.125 --> 1:07:08.750
What now? We go out and kill.

1:07:11.291 --> 1:07:12.291
But…

1:07:14.833 --> 1:07:16.833
just anyone?

1:07:17.708 --> 1:07:19.791
Can we…

1:07:22.416 --> 1:07:24.875
choose someone?

1:07:27.208 --> 1:07:31.625
If you want to kill
someone specific, that's great.

1:09:27.916 --> 1:09:30.291
How was it?

1:09:32.625 --> 1:09:34.250
Awesome.

1:09:35.708 --> 1:09:39.000
First, he got a glimpse of me,

1:09:39.083 --> 1:09:41.875
then he turned around.

1:09:42.375 --> 1:09:43.583
And I was already gone.

1:09:43.666 --> 1:09:47.750
He'll never know
if it was his imagination or not.

1:09:49.125 --> 1:09:51.625
Just like you wanted, right?

1:09:53.291 --> 1:09:55.750
So, you like it?

1:09:56.583 --> 1:09:58.041
Yeah.

1:09:58.666 --> 1:10:00.750
You see?

1:10:00.833 --> 1:10:02.208
I told you,

1:10:02.291 --> 1:10:06.291
with every minute
you'll feel it more and more.

1:10:09.333 --> 1:10:12.250
Instinct.

1:10:14.041 --> 1:10:18.125
Yeah, it's cool we are the bad guys now,

1:10:18.208 --> 1:10:22.125
and that we do what we do.

1:10:22.208 --> 1:10:29.125
And that we can
build up some suspense first.

1:10:29.208 --> 1:10:31.291
Scare them a bit.

1:10:31.375 --> 1:10:33.625
Sure we can.

1:10:36.041 --> 1:10:37.625
I even thought

1:10:38.541 --> 1:10:44.041
about roaring in some spooky way,

1:10:44.791 --> 1:10:48.583
but somehow I didn't manage to.

1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:52.125
Like this?

1:10:57.666 --> 1:11:00.416
Exactly.

1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.958
More from your belly.

1:11:16.583 --> 1:11:18.083
You'll get there.

1:11:18.833 --> 1:11:22.625
Okay, let's go and kill that bastard!

1:11:22.708 --> 1:11:24.875
He deserves it.

1:11:24.958 --> 1:11:26.791
What did he do?

1:11:27.708 --> 1:11:29.875
He is a bad man.

1:11:29.958 --> 1:11:33.500
A real, genuine dickhead.

1:11:34.250 --> 1:11:38.291
So we should
rip his head off or something.

1:11:42.041 --> 1:11:43.708
How do you want to kill him?

1:11:45.208 --> 1:11:46.708
Maybe with a knife.

1:11:48.666 --> 1:11:49.833
Classic style.

1:11:49.916 --> 1:11:51.916
That's cool too.

1:11:55.041 --> 1:11:59.000
All right. Let's cut off his electricity.

1:12:54.416 --> 1:12:56.625
Quiet! Hush.

1:13:05.333 --> 1:13:06.666
Wait.

1:13:46.583 --> 1:13:47.666
The closet!

1:14:34.125 --> 1:14:36.958
As soon as he looks in the closet,

1:14:37.041 --> 1:14:39.625
we jump out on him.

1:14:40.958 --> 1:14:42.875
And if he doesn't?

1:14:43.666 --> 1:14:46.916
He will. They always do.

1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.250
We just need to…

1:14:51.500 --> 1:14:52.375
There!

1:15:32.583 --> 1:15:33.750
Fuck.

1:15:48.458 --> 1:15:51.458
Jake, you whoring slut, shut up!

1:16:47.083 --> 1:16:50.000
So how was…

1:16:51.208 --> 1:16:54.166
my baptism of fire?

1:18:43.041 --> 1:18:48.291
You are amazing.

1:18:50.958 --> 1:18:52.208
So are you.

1:19:00.041 --> 1:19:02.041
Can I ask you something?

1:19:04.541 --> 1:19:05.666
Of course.

1:19:10.666 --> 1:19:12.125
Why me?

1:19:20.666 --> 1:19:21.666
Because…

1:19:25.916 --> 1:19:26.916
as soon as

1:19:28.416 --> 1:19:29.458
I saw you

1:19:30.250 --> 1:19:32.750
for the first time,

1:19:34.125 --> 1:19:36.000
I got this feeling…

1:19:37.916 --> 1:19:39.625
that you and I…

1:19:41.625 --> 1:19:44.791
are very much alike.

1:19:47.750 --> 1:19:51.291
And later it turned out

1:19:52.083 --> 1:19:54.541
to be true.

1:19:57.666 --> 1:20:04.625
Basically, it was as if
I saw myself in your eyes.

1:20:08.708 --> 1:20:09.833
Thank you.

1:20:13.500 --> 1:20:14.500
For what?

1:20:17.541 --> 1:20:21.083
Well, mostly for…

1:20:28.375 --> 1:20:33.500
For making me feel like I've finally found
a place for myself in this world.

1:21:00.166 --> 1:21:01.625
The doggy.

1:21:14.875 --> 1:21:16.000
Kill it.

1:21:17.791 --> 1:21:19.000
Come on…

1:21:19.625 --> 1:21:20.791
Okay.

1:21:37.291 --> 1:21:38.708
What's next?

1:21:40.125 --> 1:21:44.250
We'll free the fatties,
they might be useful.

1:21:45.083 --> 1:21:47.750
We have a lot of work to do to launch

1:21:48.541 --> 1:21:50.416
an apocalypse.

1:21:53.958 --> 1:21:58.333
First here, locally, and then, who knows?

1:22:37.666 --> 1:22:38.708
Come on.

1:22:47.791 --> 1:22:50.500
Look, that's my office.

1:22:55.541 --> 1:22:56.500
Come on.

1:23:29.000 --> 1:23:30.708
Hey, get up.

1:23:30.791 --> 1:23:32.125
You are free.

1:23:41.333 --> 1:23:43.458
Why aren't they getting up?

1:24:22.166 --> 1:24:23.750
I hate that bitch.

1:24:24.458 --> 1:24:25.916
I'll take care of her.

1:24:38.333 --> 1:24:40.291
Adaś, fuck!

1:24:40.375 --> 1:24:41.250
Adaś!

1:24:56.791 --> 1:24:58.583
No…

1:25:02.583 --> 1:25:03.916
Kill her!

1:25:04.666 --> 1:25:06.833
No!

1:25:06.916 --> 1:25:08.333
Please!

1:25:09.375 --> 1:25:11.916
I can't do it!

1:25:14.916 --> 1:25:16.791
You have to kill her right now!

1:25:27.708 --> 1:25:29.958
I can't!

1:26:07.208 --> 1:26:09.375
Here, a souvenir.

1:26:09.458 --> 1:26:11.666
Since you liked her so much.

1:26:12.375 --> 1:26:14.375
I didn't like her.

1:26:15.500 --> 1:26:18.000
It's not about that.

1:26:18.083 --> 1:26:19.291
So what is it about?

1:26:20.541 --> 1:26:22.083
Nothing.

1:26:22.166 --> 1:26:23.333
Nothing?

1:26:25.041 --> 1:26:26.458
Nothing?

1:26:51.000 --> 1:26:52.416
You men

1:26:53.041 --> 1:26:54.750
are all the same.

1:26:56.416 --> 1:26:57.625
But I…

1:26:59.333 --> 1:27:00.625
love you.

1:27:02.333 --> 1:27:03.791
You don't!

1:27:04.583 --> 1:27:06.875
If you did, you'd have killed her.

1:27:07.833 --> 1:27:09.916
Don't say that.

1:27:11.583 --> 1:27:13.083
You know what?

1:27:15.041 --> 1:27:19.791
You are weak. A cheater and a liar.

1:27:22.125 --> 1:27:25.333
Think about your behavior.

1:27:26.666 --> 1:27:29.666
What are you talking about?

1:27:36.250 --> 1:27:39.541
What did I do?

1:36:18.000 --> 1:36:22.000
