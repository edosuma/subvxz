00:00.120 --> 00:01.125
<i>Back in the '90s,</i>

00:01.166 --> 00:03.492
<i>there was no other
TV phenomenon like "Friends."</i>

00:03.581 --> 00:05.249
<i>Everybody wished they knew them,</i>

00:05.250 --> 00:07.156
<i>or in some cases, wanted to</i> be <i> them.</i>

00:07.234 --> 00:08.709
How <i> you</i> doin'?

00:08.710 --> 00:10.143
Can you <i> be </i> any more like Joey?

00:10.213 --> 00:12.079
Joey only says that to girls.

00:12.080 --> 00:14.419
I don't... I don't know any girls.

00:14.420 --> 00:15.959
<i>The faculty was equally as riveted</i>

00:15.960 --> 00:17.274
<i>watching these "Friends,"</i>

00:17.299 --> 00:18.820
<i>who always had each other's backs.</i>

00:18.845 --> 00:21.109
Barry and I watched the whole
episode together on the phone.

00:21.134 --> 00:22.469
Bonkers that's still happening.

00:22.494 --> 00:24.227
All the choices
along the course of your life,

00:24.282 --> 00:25.781
to end up back at Goldberg.

00:25.813 --> 00:27.249
He may live 500 miles away

00:27.289 --> 00:28.898
studying to become a fancy radiologist,

00:28.952 --> 00:30.417
but I've never felt
more connected to him.

00:30.496 --> 00:31.831
Everything I see reminds me of him.

00:31.887 --> 00:33.386
Like, Coop's grapes
remind me of the time

00:33.455 --> 00:34.754
I fed him on a picnic this summer.

00:34.823 --> 00:36.423
I've seen what that boy does to fruit.

00:36.491 --> 00:37.490
It's disgusting.

00:38.627 --> 00:40.927
- Uh, you gonna get that?
- I can't reach under the fridge.

00:40.996 --> 00:42.695
- Yeah, but it's gonna rot down there.
- Who cares?

00:42.764 --> 00:44.130
God, Coop, stop being such a Monica.

00:44.232 --> 00:45.265
Boy Monica's got a point.

00:45.333 --> 00:46.833
You leave that grape under there,

00:46.902 --> 00:48.468
it's gonna ferment and create wine,

00:48.537 --> 00:49.769
intoxicating the mice.

00:49.838 --> 00:51.971
Can't have drunk mice
running around here.

00:52.848 --> 00:54.381
I will simply lift this fridge

00:54.476 --> 00:56.042
and you come and grab the grape.

00:56.144 --> 00:57.777
Okay.

00:57.802 --> 00:58.822
One...

00:58.847 --> 01:00.146
Ow!

01:00.215 --> 01:02.148
My back!

01:02.217 --> 01:03.417
Damn it, mice! You win again!

<i>It was October 2nd, 1990-something,</i>

01:19.701 --> 01:20.900
<i>and our school librarian</i>

01:21.002 --> 01:23.169
<i>had a zero-tolerance policy
for nonsense.</i>

01:24.439 --> 01:26.439
Toys are forbidden in my library!

01:26.541 --> 01:29.042
He just said his first word in Furbish!

01:31.046 --> 01:34.280
No canoodling amongst the stacks,

01:34.382 --> 01:36.749
you hormonal monsters.

01:36.852 --> 01:38.117
Are we in the cafeteria?

01:38.220 --> 01:40.286
Am I wearing a hair net? No!

01:40.388 --> 01:42.622
<i>Yep, Dr. Ness was a hothead,</i>

01:42.724 --> 01:44.691
<i>but the other teachers
had kind of gotten used to it.</i>

01:44.716 --> 01:45.802
Call security.

01:45.827 --> 01:47.193
There's a crazy man in the library

01:47.295 --> 01:48.461
having a nervous breakdown.

01:48.563 --> 01:51.197
Does he have fantastic skin
and an ear-piercing scream?

01:51.299 --> 01:52.632
That pretty much nails it, yes.

01:52.734 --> 01:55.735
That's just Randall Ness,
the doctor of library arts.

01:55.804 --> 01:56.936
Are you saying he's always like this?

01:57.038 --> 01:58.538
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Pretty much.

01:58.640 --> 02:01.741
So, you guys are okay with him
throwing books?

02:01.843 --> 02:04.377
Ah, mostly paperback,
very few encyclopedias.

02:04.479 --> 02:05.645
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

02:05.747 --> 02:07.413
Maybe it's none of my business.

02:07.516 --> 02:09.249
I'll just have my students
wear hard hats

02:09.351 --> 02:10.650
when they visit the library.

02:10.719 --> 02:12.619
Well, clearly Ness
is going through something.

02:12.721 --> 02:14.454
Maybe it's just a cry for help.

02:14.556 --> 02:16.222
Seems more like a cry for him
to be fired,

02:16.324 --> 02:18.258
but I'll leave that entirely up to you.

02:18.360 --> 02:20.460
I mean, you are the boss.

02:20.562 --> 02:22.462
Well, I do have that plaque
on my desk that says,

02:22.564 --> 02:23.963
"The buck stops here."

02:24.065 --> 02:25.598
And I have that other plaque that says,

02:25.700 --> 02:27.100
"You don't have to be crazy
to work here,

02:27.202 --> 02:28.134
but it sure helps."

02:29.738 --> 02:31.070
Well, John, I'd also like to remind you

02:31.172 --> 02:32.939
that you were
a former guidance counselor,

02:33.041 --> 02:35.174
bound by the Counselor Code.

02:35.277 --> 02:37.010
Is that code for wanting
to avoid confrontation?

02:37.112 --> 02:38.144
No.

02:38.213 --> 02:39.946
It means we don't fire, we talk.

02:40.048 --> 02:41.347
We don't send people packing.

02:41.449 --> 02:42.682
Instead, we do some yakking.

02:42.784 --> 02:45.618
We need to get to the root
of Ness' growing rage

02:45.720 --> 02:46.786
and help him fix it.

02:46.888 --> 02:49.022
It's time to put away
the firing tools...

02:49.124 --> 02:52.458
And take out the compassion wrench.

02:52.561 --> 02:55.295
<i>So, Glascott set off to fix Dr. Ness,</i>

02:55.397 --> 02:57.808
<i>while I was dealing with
a bit of a broken coach.</i>

02:57.887 --> 02:58.998
How's your back feel, Rick?

02:59.100 --> 03:00.400
Well, if I cling to the A.V. cart,

03:00.502 --> 03:02.769
- I can wheel myself to the bathroom.
- Oh, man.

03:02.871 --> 03:04.137
Someone needs to drive you home.

03:04.239 --> 03:05.872
Who is your emergency contact?

03:06.841 --> 03:08.675
Wait. Susan Cinoman?

03:08.777 --> 03:10.743
Well, if you must know,

03:10.845 --> 03:13.813
Susan and I have, um, sort of a thing.

03:13.915 --> 03:14.914
Shut up.

03:15.016 --> 03:16.382
I didn't know you guys
were seeing each other.

03:16.484 --> 03:18.084
It's more of a rich, unspoken history.

03:18.194 --> 03:19.203
I guess you could say

03:19.297 --> 03:21.988
we're the Ross and Rachel
of William Penn.

03:22.090 --> 03:23.723
I am so happy for you guys.

03:23.825 --> 03:25.625
A-And a little bit weirded out.

03:25.727 --> 03:28.695
Well, I mean, we haven't shared
an evening together for...

03:28.797 --> 03:29.996
seven years,

03:30.065 --> 03:32.065
so I guess you could say
we're on a break.

03:32.167 --> 03:33.766
Just like Ross and Rachel.

03:33.802 --> 03:35.702
Although seven years
is kind of a long break.

03:35.770 --> 03:37.370
Well, you can't rush these things.

03:37.472 --> 03:38.504
Well, maybe you should.

03:38.607 --> 03:40.106
You almost died grabbing that grape.

03:40.208 --> 03:41.741
Trust me, Barry and I were apart

03:41.810 --> 03:43.343
for way too many years.

03:43.411 --> 03:44.777
If you knew what it was like
to be with a soul mate,

03:44.846 --> 03:47.180
you wouldn't waste another
second without your Barry.

03:47.248 --> 03:48.848
I gotta go find Susan. Oh, my God.

03:48.883 --> 03:49.849
Lewis, wait!

03:49.951 --> 03:51.651
Ow! Body, you betray me!

03:52.821 --> 03:55.088
- I'm sorry. Coach who?
- Coach coach.

03:55.123 --> 03:57.390
- The one and only coach.
- Craig T. Nelson?

03:57.492 --> 03:58.524
Is he here?

03:58.593 --> 04:00.393
No. Coach Mellor.

04:00.462 --> 04:02.147
Oh. Him.

04:02.233 --> 04:03.592
Oh, gosh.

04:03.670 --> 04:05.798
That was a long time ago,
and it was nothing.

04:05.867 --> 04:07.567
- What?
- It was just a fling.

04:07.636 --> 04:10.276
Besides, he is completely closed off,

04:10.339 --> 04:12.347
and I make physical <i>amore,</i>

04:12.393 --> 04:14.607
but I also make emotional <i>amore</i>

04:14.709 --> 04:17.209
and spiritual <i>amore.</i>

04:17.312 --> 04:18.878
Please stop saying <i>"amore."</i>

04:18.947 --> 04:21.613
I think it's safe to say
Coach Mellor may be

04:21.649 --> 04:23.216
under a different impression
about you two,

04:23.251 --> 04:25.151
but I'll let you guys work that out

04:25.220 --> 04:26.653
- on the way home.
- What way home?

04:26.688 --> 04:29.155
You have to drive him to his apartment.
You're his emergency contact.

04:29.224 --> 04:30.423
Oh. Can't.

04:30.492 --> 04:31.691
We've got "Man of La Mancha" coming up,

04:31.760 --> 04:34.027
and there is a lot of conquistador armor

04:34.095 --> 04:35.717
in the passenger seat of my Miata.

04:35.788 --> 04:37.263
Sorry.

04:37.332 --> 04:40.033
Thanks for the ride, Lainey Lewis.

04:40.101 --> 04:42.764
Weird how Susan was M.I.A.

04:42.843 --> 04:43.899
I guess she thought

04:43.977 --> 04:46.105
she couldn't keep her hands
off me on the way home.

04:46.174 --> 04:47.727
Uh-huh.

04:47.805 --> 04:49.208
I think I have to tell you something.

04:49.310 --> 04:50.610
It's about you and Cinoman.

04:50.679 --> 04:52.111
Turns out she doesn't exactly think

04:52.180 --> 04:53.379
you guys are like Ross and Rachel.

04:53.481 --> 04:56.015
More like, uh, Monica and Chandler?
I'll take it.

04:56.051 --> 04:58.818
Or it's possible you and Cinoman
aren't on the same show.

04:59.788 --> 05:01.020
She may be on "Wings."

05:01.114 --> 05:02.681
Oh.

05:02.783 --> 05:04.390
I see.

05:04.459 --> 05:06.626
- I'm so sorry.
- Nah, it's all right.

05:06.695 --> 05:09.062
I guess deep down inside, I...

05:09.130 --> 05:11.030
knew I was being unrealistic

05:11.066 --> 05:12.699
about a relationship with Susan.

05:12.801 --> 05:14.701
But a couple years go by and I...

05:14.803 --> 05:16.803
You don't want to admit to yourself

05:16.871 --> 05:19.605
that you're basically completely alone.

05:19.708 --> 05:21.407
- Coach...
- No, it's okay.

05:21.476 --> 05:25.111
I'll just go back to
my previous emergency contact,

05:25.180 --> 05:27.146
a guy who never lets me down...

05:27.215 --> 05:29.449
Mr. Rick Mellor.

05:30.452 --> 05:31.651
You know what?

05:31.753 --> 05:33.219
I think it's a blessing
we know this about Cinoman.

05:33.254 --> 05:35.722
Now you can move on with
your life and find your Barry.

05:35.790 --> 05:37.790
Don't you want a special Barry
for yourself?

05:37.892 --> 05:39.926
I might, if you stop
calling it a "Barry."

05:40.028 --> 05:41.694
And what if she's not out there?

05:41.763 --> 05:43.196
Of course she's out there.

05:43.264 --> 05:45.231
And I'm gonna help you find her.

05:45.300 --> 05:47.900
- You'd do that for me?
- It'd be the least I could do.

05:48.903 --> 05:50.336
Okay.

05:50.438 --> 05:52.305
I'm open to it.

05:52.373 --> 05:54.507
Great. Now, I'm gonna give you
a couple days to recover

05:54.576 --> 05:56.409
and then we'll start
finding your special...

05:57.112 --> 05:59.112
Let's find me a woman, Lainey Lewis!

05:59.180 --> 06:02.148
Meet me in my office!

06:02.250 --> 06:04.684
Wow. He heals fast.

06:04.786 --> 06:06.486
Hey.

06:06.588 --> 06:07.653
Headed to the library.

06:07.756 --> 06:09.922
About to Counselor Code it up
with Dr. Ness.

06:09.991 --> 06:11.035
What are you gonna hit him with?

06:11.113 --> 06:13.473
Well, I thought I'd start with
the old "Tap n' Talk."

06:13.543 --> 06:14.894
You know... mm.

06:14.996 --> 06:16.129
Nice.

06:16.197 --> 06:17.864
Then I'm gonna propose
a weekly steam session.

06:17.932 --> 06:19.432
Which of course
doesn't involve a steam room,

06:19.534 --> 06:20.533
just letting off some steam.

06:20.602 --> 06:21.834
You know it.

06:21.870 --> 06:23.669
I've also had a lot of luck
with assigning a rage journal,

06:23.772 --> 06:25.004
if you want to give that a shot.

06:25.073 --> 06:27.789
Ooh. I'm calm just holding this.

06:27.867 --> 06:29.842
It's all yours. Good luck.

06:29.891 --> 06:30.920
I won't need it.

06:30.945 --> 06:31.961
When I'm done with him,

06:32.023 --> 06:34.247
this guy's gonna be
mentally healthy as [bleep].

06:34.282 --> 06:36.149
That's what I like to hear, Principal.

06:37.852 --> 06:40.419
Hey, Randy. What's shakin', bacon?

06:40.488 --> 06:42.054
My dog, if you must know.

06:42.157 --> 06:43.990
He has a neurological disorder.

06:44.058 --> 06:45.925
Oh, well, that's so sad.

06:45.994 --> 06:47.760
Hey, you know what else is sad?

06:47.829 --> 06:50.396
Is when people are scared
to come to the library.

06:50.465 --> 06:52.632
Oh, is this about when
I turned over that bookshelf?

06:52.700 --> 06:54.934
No, I had not heard about that,

06:55.003 --> 06:57.837
but I am here to chat with you
about a few things,

06:57.906 --> 07:00.573
like throwing books,
uh, yelling at the students...

07:00.675 --> 07:01.874
You think I'm the problem?

07:01.976 --> 07:03.843
Those snot-nosed kids
are the damn problem.

07:03.912 --> 07:06.913
No one is saying that there's a problem.

07:07.015 --> 07:09.582
Get your hand off of me.

07:09.651 --> 07:11.851
I was just doing the Tap n' Talk.

07:11.920 --> 07:14.420
But maybe talking isn't what you need.

07:14.489 --> 07:16.856
Maybe what you need
is to express your feelings

07:16.925 --> 07:18.291
with this rage journal.

07:18.393 --> 07:19.458
Huh.

07:19.527 --> 07:21.627
That's a great idea, John.

07:21.729 --> 07:26.098
Express my feelings
with this rage journal.

07:26.201 --> 07:27.900
Like... this!

07:27.969 --> 07:29.248
Whoa!

07:30.438 --> 07:31.804
I have to fire Ness.

07:31.873 --> 07:33.105
What a great decision you came up with

07:33.174 --> 07:34.807
- entirely on your own.
- Thank you.

07:34.876 --> 07:36.042
He is a person, John.

07:36.110 --> 07:38.644
He has a mother
and a favorite ice-cream flavor

07:38.713 --> 07:40.980
and a dog that he threw
a birthday party for,

07:41.049 --> 07:43.216
which I attended and had so much fun.

07:43.318 --> 07:45.251
You could try water therapy,
as long as you're both

07:45.320 --> 07:46.819
comfortable in bathing suits together.

07:46.921 --> 07:49.088
- Pool or tank?
- Please ignore CB.

07:49.157 --> 07:50.590
You're the person we're all looking to

07:50.692 --> 07:52.158
for decisive action here.

07:52.260 --> 07:54.193
You have to stop viewing Ness
as a human being.

07:54.295 --> 07:56.596
He's a man-shaped problem
in a tweed blazer

07:56.664 --> 07:57.763
who needs to go.

07:57.866 --> 07:59.365
How can you be so heartless?

07:59.434 --> 08:01.467
- Right?
- No, I want to know how.

08:01.536 --> 08:03.697
I tried to get through to him
and give him a second chance,

08:03.783 --> 08:04.837
but he refused.

08:04.939 --> 08:07.540
Wilma Howell,
teach me how to be heartless.

08:07.642 --> 08:09.609
A lot of my kids have this same trouble

08:09.711 --> 08:11.811
separating their emotions
from their work.

08:11.880 --> 08:13.980
Why don't you pop by
my biology lab today?

08:14.082 --> 08:15.181
- Sounds fun.
- Yeah.

08:15.283 --> 08:17.283
You're gonna cut open
a cute little froggy.

08:17.385 --> 08:18.784
Oh.

08:18.887 --> 08:20.253
In this first column, I've written down

08:20.355 --> 08:22.188
all the places to meet women
in our community,

08:22.290 --> 08:24.891
and on this side, I've listed
all the places you go.

08:26.094 --> 08:27.960
- Good news. One match.
- No!

08:28.062 --> 08:29.061
Absolutely not.

08:29.163 --> 08:31.364
Fitness club is where
I focus on this temple.

08:31.466 --> 08:33.933
I can do a standing jump
on this table right now.

08:34.034 --> 08:35.768
That means I don't need a running start.

08:35.870 --> 08:38.437
I cannot train my body
to do that kind of thing

08:38.539 --> 08:39.538
while I'm flirting.

08:39.640 --> 08:40.806
You wanna see me jump?

08:40.909 --> 08:42.341
I most certainly do not.

08:42.409 --> 08:44.798
Okay. Your loss.

08:44.868 --> 08:45.878
What else you got?

08:45.980 --> 08:47.079
That's your only option, buddy.

08:47.181 --> 08:48.581
Do you really not go
to the grocery store?

08:48.683 --> 08:49.649
Where do you buy your food?

08:49.751 --> 08:51.017
The neighborhood farm plot.

08:51.119 --> 08:53.562
You want to get the kind of
ruby-red I get in a beet?

08:53.679 --> 08:55.488
You got to grow it yourself.

08:55.590 --> 08:56.555
Then we can ask around

08:56.658 --> 08:58.024
and find some people to set you up with?

08:58.126 --> 08:59.058
If you give it time,

08:59.160 --> 09:00.860
you will absolutely find someone.

09:00.962 --> 09:01.894
It seems so difficult.

09:01.996 --> 09:03.696
If only finding a mate was as efficient

09:03.798 --> 09:04.964
as recruiting a ball player.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.699
I get these guys in front of me,
and within five minutes,

09:06.768 --> 09:09.068
I can tell if they're Mellor material.

09:09.170 --> 09:10.870
Yeah, I'm not sure...

09:10.972 --> 09:13.539
Wait a second. That actually exists.

09:15.200 --> 09:17.243
Let's find you a new recruit.

09:21.412 --> 09:24.148
<i>Principal Glascott knew
he needed to fire Dr. Ness,</i>

09:24.226 --> 09:25.937
<i>but he needed
a little bit of practice first</i>

09:26.003 --> 09:27.302
<i>at being a little more ruthless.</i>

09:27.373 --> 09:29.542
Now, no more dawdling.
Time to cut and gut.

09:29.599 --> 09:31.118
This is hard,

09:31.187 --> 09:34.005
knowing that this frog
had a family and a name.

09:34.060 --> 09:35.422
Its name was Sample 27.

09:35.491 --> 09:36.945
I bet he went by Sampley.

09:37.016 --> 09:38.349
You're not helping, CB.

09:38.418 --> 09:40.685
I'm helping remind you
who you are, John.

09:40.787 --> 09:42.520
I'm helping you be a better leader.

09:42.555 --> 09:43.921
Okay, everyone just stop talking.

09:43.990 --> 09:45.189
I'm doing this.

09:45.291 --> 09:46.657
Don't hurt me.

09:46.759 --> 09:49.493
I play the banjo and I'm in
love with Miss Piggy. Ooh.

09:49.562 --> 09:51.717
John, this frog is not Kermit.

09:51.811 --> 09:53.163
Kermit's not even Kermit.

09:53.241 --> 09:54.899
He's just felt and a man's hand.

09:54.968 --> 09:56.167
In a moment like this,

09:56.236 --> 09:58.502
it's best to separate yourself
from your feelings,

09:58.571 --> 10:00.572
like I have to
whenever CB starts talking.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.275
- That's rude.
- I'm sorry.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.627
I just can't turn off
my emotions like that.

10:04.705 --> 10:07.545
Good. Emotions are what
make you you, John.

10:07.647 --> 10:09.313
Or are your emotions holding you back?

10:09.382 --> 10:12.717
This is for the greater good, John.

10:12.785 --> 10:13.851
You're right.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.887
I'm head of school now.

10:15.955 --> 10:18.189
Head of schools cut frogs.

10:18.258 --> 10:21.058
Metaphorically.

10:24.864 --> 10:27.365
I hope Sampley haunts you
from the grave.

10:27.433 --> 10:29.333
<i>I had convinced Coach that speed-dating</i>

10:29.435 --> 10:31.168
<i>was the perfect venue
to find a quick match,</i>

10:31.237 --> 10:34.805
<i>but he may have taken the quick
part a little too seriously.</i>

10:34.908 --> 10:37.541
I weigh a buck-85. How about you?

10:37.644 --> 10:38.676
You ever live on a boat?

10:38.745 --> 10:40.578
Is that a wig,
or is that your real hair?

10:40.680 --> 10:41.913
What's your favorite kind of squat?

10:45.285 --> 10:47.151
Oh, no. What is he doing?

10:47.253 --> 10:49.420
Mellor!

10:50.657 --> 10:51.789
You a fan of beet juice?

10:51.858 --> 10:53.491
Winter Olympics or Summer Olympics?

10:53.593 --> 10:54.959
Don't think, just answer.

10:55.028 --> 10:58.062
Talk to me about your paternal
grandmother's medical history.

10:59.632 --> 11:02.366
- We need to talk.
- Whoa!

11:02.468 --> 11:03.901
I didn't see you
pay the registration fee.

11:03.970 --> 11:06.037
I'm not speed-dating you, dummy.
I'm here to coach you.

11:06.105 --> 11:07.204
You can't just ask these women

11:07.273 --> 11:09.307
about their body mass
and root-vegetable intake.

11:09.409 --> 11:10.841
Why? If there are deal-breakers,

11:10.944 --> 11:12.743
it's best everybody
knows about them now.

11:12.812 --> 11:15.079
Slow down and try
and have a real conversation.

11:15.181 --> 11:16.781
Listen to what these women are saying.

11:16.849 --> 11:18.215
Well, if they're expressing

11:18.284 --> 11:20.718
that they don't like that their
BMI is in the "warning" range,

11:20.820 --> 11:22.153
I can't say that I blame them.

11:22.221 --> 11:23.554
I know this seems crazy,

11:23.623 --> 11:25.723
but this is a real opportunity
for you to meet someone,

11:25.825 --> 11:26.857
and I want that for you.

11:26.960 --> 11:29.327
I want it, too. But I'm...

11:29.395 --> 11:31.128
Scared?

11:32.131 --> 11:33.597
- Yeah.
- I get that,

11:33.666 --> 11:36.452
but you're only going to get out
of this what you put into it.

11:36.507 --> 11:37.671
Show them you're vulnerable.

11:37.728 --> 11:39.162
I don't know how to do that.

11:39.205 --> 11:41.172
You just did when
you admitted you were scared.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.707
You're looking for a partner,
not a football recruit.

11:43.810 --> 11:45.676
Put Coach on the sideline and be Rick.

11:45.745 --> 11:48.045
Okay. Game on.

11:48.114 --> 11:50.247
I m... I mean, normal conversation on.

11:50.316 --> 11:52.716
Okay.

11:53.953 --> 11:56.253
- How you doing? I'm Rick.
- Samantha.

11:56.289 --> 11:58.722
- How you doing, Samantha?
- A-Actually, I'm really nervous.

11:58.791 --> 12:01.192
Well, you know what?
I'm really nervous, too.

12:01.260 --> 12:03.794
So, maybe we'll just be
really nervous together.

12:03.896 --> 12:06.530
Okay.

12:08.067 --> 12:09.700
Yes.

12:09.802 --> 12:11.135
Hey, Wilma.

12:11.237 --> 12:13.838
Guess who's fired up
and eager to get in there

12:13.906 --> 12:16.307
with absolutely no qualms
and fire Dr. Ness?

12:16.409 --> 12:17.341
This guy.

12:17.410 --> 12:18.776
How long have you been standing there?

12:18.878 --> 12:20.277
Uh, about 45 minutes.

12:20.379 --> 12:21.579
And I can't waste any more time.

12:21.681 --> 12:23.414
I've already missed
one important meeting,

12:23.483 --> 12:24.582
but I guess that was good

12:24.684 --> 12:26.550
for the kid who set the flag on fire.

12:26.652 --> 12:27.952
We've gone over this.

12:28.020 --> 12:30.154
Switch off your emotions
for the greater good.

12:30.223 --> 12:31.856
Why does the female praying mantis

12:31.924 --> 12:33.724
bite off the male's head while mating?

12:33.826 --> 12:35.259
Oh, my God. They actually do that?

12:35.328 --> 12:36.861
I'm gonna guess for the greater good.

12:36.963 --> 12:37.895
Correct.

12:37.964 --> 12:39.897
His death spasms increase the odds

12:39.999 --> 12:41.332
of successful procreation.

12:41.434 --> 12:42.333
Gross.

12:42.401 --> 12:43.969
All right, cleansing breath, John.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.436
Let's get in there and do this.

12:45.538 --> 12:46.737
- No cleansing breath!
- Ooh!

12:46.806 --> 12:48.973
- Go eat his damn head!
- Ah!

12:49.041 --> 12:53.110
That is a lot of money to be
spending on a Weimaraner.

12:53.179 --> 12:55.579
But if the surgery buys me
a few extra months,

12:55.615 --> 12:57.848
then I just gotta get him to
his next birthday.

12:57.950 --> 12:59.917
I can't do this.

13:00.019 --> 13:02.052
All right, thanks.

13:02.121 --> 13:04.255
The library's closed.

13:04.323 --> 13:07.791
Dr. Ness, there is
no easy way to say this,

13:07.860 --> 13:09.927
but in light of your behavior,

13:10.029 --> 13:10.928
I have to.

13:11.030 --> 13:12.897
First of all, I want to thank you

13:12.965 --> 13:15.299
for all the work you've done
here at William Penn.

13:15.401 --> 13:16.433
Wait, wait, hold on.

13:16.502 --> 13:20.237
It... It... It sounds like
you're firing me.

13:20.339 --> 13:21.338
As principal,

13:21.440 --> 13:24.275
I need to run the best school possible,

13:24.377 --> 13:26.377
and you've become toxic.

13:26.479 --> 13:28.479
You can't do this.

13:28.548 --> 13:30.648
I'm a doctor of library sciences.

13:30.750 --> 13:32.016
You're just a...

13:32.084 --> 13:34.919
mister with some bachelor's degree.

13:35.955 --> 13:37.888
Dr. Ness, you're fired.

13:40.293 --> 13:41.659
Are you crying?

13:41.727 --> 13:43.093
No.

13:48.000 --> 13:48.999
This is so exciting.

13:49.068 --> 13:50.701
The proctor is tallying up
all the matches.

13:50.803 --> 13:52.069
I really got into it at the end there.

13:52.171 --> 13:54.038
Good. I bet you and Samantha matched.

13:54.140 --> 13:56.407
Well, she loves beets as much as I do.

13:56.509 --> 13:57.575
I told you not to talk about beets.

13:57.677 --> 13:59.643
The conversation
just naturally went there.

13:59.745 --> 14:00.778
This is yours.

14:00.846 --> 14:02.513
And yours.

14:02.582 --> 14:03.847
Oh, no, no, no. I wasn't even...

14:03.950 --> 14:05.816
Oh, wow. 10?

14:05.918 --> 14:07.885
How'd you do?

14:07.954 --> 14:09.954
Uh, well, I got none.

14:10.056 --> 14:12.289
What? No, that can't be right.

14:12.391 --> 14:14.425
I hate Samantha.

14:14.527 --> 14:16.260
Well, that's that. It was good fun.

14:16.362 --> 14:18.462
Um... let's go to a bar.

14:18.564 --> 14:20.364
I'm a fantastic wing woman.

14:20.466 --> 14:21.599
Eh, I, uh...

14:21.701 --> 14:23.667
I got some stuff I gotta do.

14:23.769 --> 14:24.969
You know what I was thinking?

14:25.037 --> 14:27.071
You know those dating shows
like "Studs" or "Singled Out"?

14:27.173 --> 14:29.139
I bet you would be great
on one of those.

14:29.175 --> 14:31.609
Lainey, just stop, okay?
I-It just didn't work.

14:31.711 --> 14:33.777
I don't want to date anybody
anymore, okay?

14:33.847 --> 14:36.040
- No, it's not okay, Rick.
- Don't you get it?

14:36.166 --> 14:38.716
I was happier pretending
that I had somebody in my life

14:38.741 --> 14:39.794
than confirming the fact

14:39.819 --> 14:41.285
that I'm not compatible with anyone.

14:41.387 --> 14:43.287
I'm closing my heart for good.

14:43.389 --> 14:45.956
No. Rick, come on.

14:46.058 --> 14:48.659
Not everybody gets to be happy
in love, Lainey Lewis.

14:52.886 --> 14:55.161
<i>After firing his problem librarian,</i>

14:55.217 --> 14:58.208
<i>Glascott had a new problem...
extreme guilt.</i>

14:58.287 --> 15:00.774
<i>But he had a plan to make things better.</i>

15:01.981 --> 15:03.080
I got your message.

15:03.182 --> 15:04.582
What do you need to talk about?

15:04.650 --> 15:07.218
To be honest, it's kind of weird
for me to be here since...

15:07.320 --> 15:08.586
you fired me.

15:08.654 --> 15:10.955
Fired you as a librarian,
but that doesn't mean

15:11.023 --> 15:12.957
I can't hire you
to help organize my office.

15:13.025 --> 15:14.225
Look at this place.

15:14.293 --> 15:16.433
I really let it get away from me.

15:16.519 --> 15:20.464
I need your help, at $7 an hour.

15:20.566 --> 15:22.366
I have two Masters and a doctorate.

15:22.401 --> 15:24.300
So...$7.50?

15:24.355 --> 15:25.569
But look, at that rate,
you're gonna have to

15:25.638 --> 15:27.171
come by my house
and do some landscaping,

15:27.206 --> 15:28.339
or maybe some light painting.

15:28.407 --> 15:30.274
Right now, my kitchen is in powder blue,

15:30.343 --> 15:31.709
but I would love
to see it in periwinkle.

15:34.714 --> 15:35.946
We need to talk.

15:36.048 --> 15:37.248
I'm not sure we do.

15:37.350 --> 15:39.884
Rick, I know it's hard
to open yourself up,

15:39.952 --> 15:41.619
but it's better
than living your whole life

15:41.721 --> 15:42.987
closed off to love.

15:43.022 --> 15:45.556
Who needs love when you've got
"SportsCenter" and a Bowflex?

15:45.625 --> 15:47.391
Come on. Would you tell a kid
to stop playing sports

15:47.460 --> 15:48.492
because he lost one game?

15:48.594 --> 15:50.594
That's easy for you to say.
You have Barry.

15:50.630 --> 15:52.830
You don't know anything about
love being... hard.

15:52.899 --> 15:54.031
That's where you're wrong.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.100
I know I always talk about
how great it is,

15:56.169 --> 15:57.835
but it's been really hard
having Barry so far away.

15:57.970 --> 15:59.203
You know the other night when I said

15:59.272 --> 16:00.604
we were watching "Friends"
on the phone together?

16:00.673 --> 16:02.706
- Yeah.
- Well, the truth is, he fell asleep.

16:02.775 --> 16:04.441
He doesn't love "Friends" like I do.

16:04.510 --> 16:06.076
He likes "Suddenly Susan" better.

16:06.145 --> 16:08.145
Well, that is a problem.

16:08.247 --> 16:09.980
All relationships are challenging,

16:10.016 --> 16:11.382
but they're worth it.

16:11.450 --> 16:13.884
And you're really missing out
if you're not willing to try.

16:13.953 --> 16:16.921
Well, how do you propose I try?

16:17.023 --> 16:20.024
Well, just keep this open.

16:20.092 --> 16:23.093
Might not happen fast,
but be ready when it does.

16:23.162 --> 16:26.230
And don't be afraid
to show her who you really are.

16:30.770 --> 16:33.370
Look, John, I-I-I see
what you're trying to do.

16:33.472 --> 16:35.606
I just feel so awful.

16:35.675 --> 16:37.541
Firing you was very hard on me.

16:37.577 --> 16:39.176
I-I just hate the thought

16:39.245 --> 16:40.978
of putting you out on the street.

16:41.047 --> 16:43.180
Truth is, I'm glad you fired me.

16:43.282 --> 16:45.349
It was a big wake-up call.

16:45.451 --> 16:47.418
I was angry, burned out.

16:47.486 --> 16:48.586
- Yeah.
- I mean, in 10 years,

16:48.654 --> 16:50.955
are people even gonna need a librarian?

16:50.980 --> 16:51.999
Of course.

16:52.024 --> 16:53.457
Where else would people get books?

16:53.559 --> 16:56.679
And what? Will a computer tell
you what you'd like to read?

16:56.757 --> 16:58.762
I don't think so.

17:01.067 --> 17:03.033
Wait, is that Dr. Ness?

17:03.135 --> 17:04.401
Why is he back?

17:04.470 --> 17:07.338
Uh, well, it seems like John...
who's a human being...

17:07.440 --> 17:08.571
feels guilty

17:08.608 --> 17:10.974
and is now trying to pay Ness
to be his manservant.

17:11.042 --> 17:13.944
I think it's sweet that Glascott
ransacked his entire office

17:14.046 --> 17:15.512
just to help heal a friend.

17:15.580 --> 17:18.048
This school's just a lot to get used to.

17:18.150 --> 17:20.851
It was the tough love of
the firing that woke me up,

17:20.953 --> 17:22.819
but after I calmed down,

17:22.887 --> 17:25.122
it was your kindness and words of wisdom

17:25.223 --> 17:28.224
that pointed me in the direction
I needed to go.

17:28.294 --> 17:31.161
I finally started
anger-management counseling.

17:31.264 --> 17:33.998
And I'm on my fourth rage journal.

17:37.703 --> 17:40.070
He gave me the Tap n' Talk.

17:43.476 --> 17:44.708
How'd it go?

17:44.744 --> 17:46.844
Well, I broke some pretty
valuable stuff in my office.

17:46.946 --> 17:48.212
I didn't think that through.

17:48.247 --> 17:50.514
But Dr. Ness is gonna be fine.

17:50.616 --> 17:51.629
I gotta say,

17:51.691 --> 17:54.051
I heard the way your kindness
affected Ness for the better.

17:54.153 --> 17:55.919
Your touchy-feely Counselor Code

17:55.988 --> 17:57.621
has its role in being a boss.

17:57.691 --> 17:59.352
Well, we appreciate you saying
you could learn

17:59.407 --> 18:01.563
- a few things from both of us.
- That's not what I said.

18:01.594 --> 18:03.827
Actually, I've learned in
some ways, you both were right.

18:03.863 --> 18:06.463
I needed to be hard on him
in order to protect the school,

18:06.565 --> 18:08.966
and I needed to be kind to support him.

18:08.991 --> 18:10.034
And I did both.

18:10.102 --> 18:11.168
Good job, John.

18:11.270 --> 18:14.004
I don't need your praise,
but I do need both of you

18:14.106 --> 18:15.539
to come help me clean up my office.

18:15.608 --> 18:18.275
Step lightly,
'cause I broke a few figurines.

18:18.344 --> 18:20.544
<i>Turns out, Glascott was able
to grow as a boss</i>

18:20.646 --> 18:22.261
<i>but stay true to himself.</i>

18:22.339 --> 18:25.916
<i>He was part counselor,
part principal, all Glascott.</i>

18:26.018 --> 18:27.084
Hi.

18:27.186 --> 18:29.553
Uh, excuse me.
My nephew loves your class.

18:29.655 --> 18:31.021
You're the gym teacher, right?

18:31.090 --> 18:32.356
Oh, yeah. Coach Mellor.

18:32.458 --> 18:33.757
Julie. I'm Toby's aunt.

18:33.859 --> 18:34.792
Welcome.

18:34.860 --> 18:36.727
Thanks, Coach.

18:36.796 --> 18:38.162
Toby's a big fan of your class.

18:38.264 --> 18:39.763
Well, that's nice to hear.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.666
Enjoy your evening.

18:48.140 --> 18:50.274
Uh, on second thought,
you should call me Rick.

18:50.376 --> 18:52.242
Hey, Rick.

18:53.279 --> 18:55.312
This is gonna sound
very strange, but I feel like...

18:55.348 --> 18:57.047
Have we met before?
You look very familiar.

18:57.116 --> 18:58.682
I-I didn't want to make this weird,

18:58.751 --> 19:00.751
but I actually think
that we go to the same gym.

19:00.853 --> 19:02.720
That's right! Yeah!

19:02.822 --> 19:04.421
Sorry. I'm sorry I never said hi.

19:04.490 --> 19:06.423
I just... I'm pretty focused
on my workout, so...

19:06.492 --> 19:08.826
Oh, good for you.
I'm never focused enough.

19:10.563 --> 19:12.062
Well, you don't look like you need it.

19:12.164 --> 19:13.564
<i>Opening your heart can be scary,</i>

19:13.632 --> 19:15.366
<i>but when you have people
who support you,</i>

19:15.468 --> 19:17.601
- <i>it can make it a little bit easier.</i>
- Oh, my gosh!

19:17.670 --> 19:19.770
That is amazing.

19:20.833 --> 19:21.855
How do you do that?

19:21.880 --> 19:23.307
I almost didn't.

19:26.312 --> 19:28.812
Hey, who was that in the gym you
were talking to for 20 minutes?

19:28.914 --> 19:31.068
- Her name is Julie.
- She's cute.

19:31.138 --> 19:32.443
Yeah, she's a nurse.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.151
Gave me an earful about stretching

19:34.253 --> 19:35.819
before I jump up on a table.

19:35.921 --> 19:37.654
- Oh, or lift a fridge.
- Yeah.

19:37.723 --> 19:39.556
I think I like her.

19:39.658 --> 19:42.025
Who knows? Maybe something
will happen, maybe it won't.

19:42.128 --> 19:43.527
Yeah, you never do know.

19:43.629 --> 19:45.229
You want to wait for me for a sec?

19:45.331 --> 19:47.297
I got to turn this in
to the nurse's office.

19:50.703 --> 19:52.035
<i>That's the thing about friends.</i>

19:52.138 --> 19:54.438
<i>They can get you through
whatever life throws your way.</i>

19:54.540 --> 19:58.075
<i>Whether it's opening your heart
or giving some tough love,</i>

19:58.177 --> 20:00.057
<i>they'll always be there for you.</i>

20:00.378 --> 20:02.823
I'm a lot denser than I look...
physically, I mean.

20:02.909 --> 20:06.065
Favorite singer? Easy.
Mr. Burt Bacharach.

20:06.136 --> 20:07.202
Was I not just talking to you?

20:07.304 --> 20:08.804
You guys are all starting to look alike.

20:08.906 --> 20:11.573
I'm looking for a teammate,
a doubles partner,

20:11.675 --> 20:14.286
a holder to put down
the football of love

20:14.333 --> 20:17.497
so I can kick it right through
the uprights of companionship.

20:17.606 --> 20:19.130
Let's arm wrestle. Come on.

20:19.177 --> 20:21.416
I'm... I'm gonna win, but I want
to see how strong you are.

20:21.518 --> 20:23.363
Yeah, I know they say "big-boned."

20:23.457 --> 20:24.606
It's what you hear all the time.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.355
A person can lose weight
in their bones. Trust me.

20:27.458 --> 20:29.491
I noticed your hands are super rough.

20:29.593 --> 20:32.060
You work with your hands
or is that an allergy?

20:32.162 --> 20:34.803
My favorite sensation
is the wind on my thighs.

20:34.873 --> 20:37.215
Makes them feel free
'cause they're American.

20:37.240 --> 20:40.902
As of today, it has been 38
months since I've worn pants.

20:41.004 --> 20:43.738
Oh, well, I think it's weird
you can't sleep standing up.

20:43.841 --> 20:45.540
I want to test your tensile strength.

20:45.642 --> 20:48.053
I want you to squeeze my hand
as hard as you can.

20:48.139 --> 20:49.544
Don't worry. You will not hurt me.

20:49.646 --> 20:52.171
If I had one wish,
it'd be to be a centaur.

20:52.241 --> 20:54.349
Can't be strong enough
in the lower body.

20:54.451 --> 20:56.985
I'm not shouting!! You're shouting!!

20:57.087 --> 20:58.920
Where are you going?
We still have more time.

20:59.022 --> 21:00.188
Timer didn't go off.
