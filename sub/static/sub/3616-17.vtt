00:16.262 --> 00:17.371
PAIGE!WHERE ARE YOU?

00:17.471 --> 00:18.761
LOOK OUT!

00:23.973 --> 00:27.291
[Piper] HURRY--

00:27.391 --> 00:28.764
[All] "CLAWS OF PAIN
WE HAVE TO SEVER.

00:30.765 --> 00:32.749
DEMON, YOU ARE GONE
FOREVER."

00:32.849 --> 00:34.434
AAH!

00:36.767 --> 00:37.977
SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU,

00:40.228 --> 00:41.545
BUT
SHE WAS IMMUNE
TO MY POWERS.

00:41.645 --> 00:44.588
THAT'S OK. I WAS
JUST GETTING READY
TO LEAVE WORK.

00:44.688 --> 00:46.338
OH, HONEY,
YOU'RE HURT.

00:46.438 --> 00:47.713
OH...IT'S OK.
IT'S JUST A SCRATCH.

00:47.813 --> 00:49.714
SO HOW'S IT GOING?

00:49.814 --> 00:51.256
HOW'S THE NEW PLACE?

00:51.356 --> 00:52.672
GREAT. AND GREAT.

00:52.772 --> 00:54.923
HOW ABOUT YOU?

00:55.023 --> 00:56.550
CAN'T COMPLAIN.

00:56.650 --> 00:57.841
DITTO.

00:57.941 --> 00:59.634
WELL, IT'S GOOD TO KNOW
THAT WE CAN LIVE APART

00:59.734 --> 01:01.925
AND STILL KICK SOME BUTT
IF WE HAVE TO, RIGHT?

01:02.026 --> 01:05.010
SO DO I WANNA ASK
ABOUT THIS DEMON

01:05.110 --> 01:06.927
WITH THE BAD
MANICURE?

01:07.027 --> 01:08.720
UH...HARPY,
PART OF A FACTION,

01:08.820 --> 01:10.677
TRIED TO KILL US
TO MOVE UP
IN THE WORLD.

01:10.777 --> 01:12.678
YOU KNOW,
PRETTY STANDARD
STUFF.

01:12.778 --> 01:14.678
YOU WANNA STAY
FOR DINNER?

01:14.778 --> 01:16.181
I WOULD LOVE TO,

01:16.281 --> 01:17.598
BUT COLE IS PLANNING
THIS WHOLE
ROMANTIC THING

01:17.698 --> 01:19.599
FOR US TONIGHT.

01:19.699 --> 01:20.943
YEAH, I JUST
THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE WE COULD TALK.

01:20.953 --> 01:23.016
WHY? ARE YOU OK?
IS EVERYTHING OK?

01:23.116 --> 01:25.392
YEAH.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

01:25.492 --> 01:26.682
I JUST THOUGHT
MAYBE WE COULD
CATCH UP.

01:26.782 --> 01:29.226
ANOTHER TIME.

01:29.326 --> 01:31.269
DO YOU WANT ME
TO ORB YOU HOME?

01:31.369 --> 01:33.327
NO. COLE'S NOT SO CRAZY
ABOUT YOU ORBING IN
WITHOUT CALLING FIRST.

01:33.494 --> 01:36.978
EXCEPT FOR EMERGENCIES,
YOU KNOW?

01:37.078 --> 01:39.686
YOU UNDERSTAND.

01:39.786 --> 01:40.621
SURE. WHATEVER.

01:40.913 --> 01:43.981
OK.

01:44.081 --> 01:45.081
I'M GONNA GO.

01:46.581 --> 01:49.666
I'LL CALL YOU GUYS.

01:53.751 --> 01:56.692
NO ORBING?

01:56.792 --> 01:58.735
DON'T START WITH
THE SUSPICIONS,
PAIGE.

01:58.835 --> 02:01.253
COLE'S PROBABLY
JUST TRYING TO...
PROTECT THEIR PRIVACY.

02:03.546 --> 02:06.946
HE'S TRYING TO PROTECT
SOMETHING.

02:07.046 --> 02:10.448
I'M JUST TRYING
TO PROTECT OUR ASSETS.

02:10.548 --> 02:12.948
AND THE ONLY WAY
TO DO THAT IS TO
CUT OUR LOSSES,

02:13.048 --> 02:16.675
CONSOLIDATE
OUR RESOURCES...

02:17.798 --> 02:21.242
KEEP THE COMPETITION
FROM KILLING YOU.

02:21.342 --> 02:24.118
US.

02:24.218 --> 02:25.118
FINE. WHAT ARE YOU
PROPOSING?

02:25.218 --> 02:26.827
A MERGER.
EVERYONE HERE HAS
SIMILAR AGENDAS, RIGHT?

02:26.927 --> 02:29.928
SO, WHY DON'T WE
WORK TOGETHER
TO ACCOMPLISH THEM?

02:35.804 --> 02:39.098
YOU'RE LATE. SIT DOWN.

02:46.225 --> 02:49.460
WHERE WAS I?

02:49.560 --> 02:51.793
YOU WERE JUST
ENCOURAGING US TO...

02:51.893 --> 02:53.709
HOLD HANDS
AND BE FRIENDS.

02:53.809 --> 02:55.710
IT'S A NEW MILLENNIUM.

02:55.810 --> 02:57.181
WE NEED TO THINK
IN NEW WAYS TO ENSURE
OUR OWN SURVIVAL.

02:57.191 --> 02:59.604
LET'S FACE IT.
IT'S A DEMON-EAT-DEMON
WORLD OUT THERE.

03:04.022 --> 03:07.714
EACH ONE OF YOU
LEADS A FACTION.

03:07.814 --> 03:10.049
BUT THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

03:10.149 --> 03:12.883
YOU'RE TOO BUSY

03:12.983 --> 03:13.716
TRYING TO KILL EACH OTHER.

03:13.816 --> 03:15.884
IN THE END...

03:15.984 --> 03:17.717
EVERYONE LOSES.

03:17.817 --> 03:19.260
TELL <i>THAT
</i> TO THE GRIMLOCKS.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.695
THEY TRIED
TO VANQUISH US
JUST LAST WEEK.

03:22.194 --> 03:25.554
YOU HAD IT COMING.

03:25.654 --> 03:27.720
CARE TO TRY AGAIN?

03:27.820 --> 03:28.930
[GROWLING]

03:29.030 --> 03:31.056
MY POINT EXACTLY.

03:31.156 --> 03:32.264
INFIGHTING HAS ALWAYS
BEEN OUR UNDOING.

03:32.364 --> 03:35.265
NOW, I HAVE LEARNED
FROM THE HUMANITY
IN ME.

03:35.365 --> 03:37.475
THE ONLY WAY FOR US
TO DEFEAT GOOD
IS TO WORK TOGETHER

03:37.575 --> 03:40.659
TO ACHIEVE COMMON GOALS.

03:41.824 --> 03:42.701
AND WHO WILL DECIDE
WHAT THESE GOALS ARE...

03:45.618 --> 03:47.726
YOU?

03:47.826 --> 03:48.952
UNLESS SOMEONE
WANTS TO CHALLENGE ME.

03:49.411 --> 03:51.454
[ELEVATOR DINGS]

03:52.827 --> 03:54.828

04:02.583 --> 04:05.731
HI, HONEY.

04:05.832 --> 04:07.208
YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

05:16.854 --> 05:20.257
VEGETARIAN EGG WHITE

05:20.357 --> 05:21.923
JUST THE WAY
YOU LIKE IT.

05:22.023 --> 05:23.757
MM.

05:23.857 --> 05:24.757
THAT'S SWEET, HONEY,

05:24.857 --> 05:26.024
BUT I THINK MY STOMACH
HAS OTHER PLANS.

05:26.857 --> 05:28.857
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

05:30.234 --> 05:31.385
HEADACHE,
UPSET STOMACH.

05:31.485 --> 05:33.344
IT'S GOING AROUND
RIGHT NOW.

05:33.444 --> 05:34.969
SO MAYBE YOU SHOULD
CALL IN SICK.

05:35.069 --> 05:36.928
WHILE SO MANY
RELATIONSHIPS
ARE IN PERIL?

05:37.028 --> 05:39.471
WHAT WOULD
SAN FRANCISCO DO
WITHOUT MY ADVICE COLUMN?

05:39.571 --> 05:42.346
I GOTTA GO.

05:42.447 --> 05:44.763
I WANNA INVITE
MY SISTERS OVER
FOR DINNER THIS WEEK.

05:44.863 --> 05:47.763
IS THAT OK?

05:47.863 --> 05:49.349
WELL, WE JUST
MOVED OUT.

05:49.449 --> 05:51.764
YEAH, I KNOW,
BUT I WANT TO
SHOW THEM THE PLACE.

05:51.864 --> 05:53.475
BESIDES, I DON'T
WANT THEM TO THINK

05:53.575 --> 05:55.559
THAT THEY'RE NOT
STILL PART OF MY LIFE,
YOU KNOW?

05:55.659 --> 05:58.767
FINE.

05:58.867 --> 06:00.060
JUST, UH, NO ORBING,
ALL RIGHT?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.161
ALREADY TAKEN CARE OF.

06:02.411 --> 06:03.952
WHAT HAPPENED?

06:05.869 --> 06:06.770
OH, NOTHING.

06:06.870 --> 06:07.937
MY SHOULDER
JUST GOT IN THE WAY

06:08.037 --> 06:09.480
OF A HARPY'S CLAW,
THAT'S ALL.

06:09.580 --> 06:10.980
A HARPY?
YOU GOT ATTACKED?

06:11.080 --> 06:12.147
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

06:12.247 --> 06:15.499
BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS THAT BIG
OF A DEAL, THAT'S WHY.WELL, IT IS TO ME.

06:18.583 --> 06:19.166
I'M SORRY.

06:21.874 --> 06:23.359
I'M SORRY.

06:23.459 --> 06:25.402
IT'S JUST...

06:25.502 --> 06:27.628
I THINK I DESERVE
TO KNOW WHEN
MY WIFE GETS HURT.

06:28.876 --> 06:30.877
YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU DO.

06:33.170 --> 06:33.877
EXCUSE ME, MR. TURNER.

06:36.713 --> 06:39.281

DOING HERE?

06:41.298 --> 06:43.156
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME
SHE WAS HERE.

MY OFFICE.

DO YOU?

06:48.882 --> 06:50.576

IF YOU'RE INTO
THAT SORT OF THING.

07:11.057 --> 07:13.709
GET THE LEADER
OF THE HARPIES.

07:13.809 --> 07:15.517
I WANT TO EXPLAIN
TO HER THE CONSEQUENCES
OF ATTACKING MY WIFE.

07:22.893 --> 07:26.837
YOU DON'T REALLY
EXPECT ME TO WAGE WAR
ON THE NEW SOURCE

07:26.937 --> 07:29.963
WITHOUT EVEN TALKING
TO HIM FIRST, DO YOU?

07:30.063 --> 07:32.172
IT'S A WASTE OF TIME.

07:32.272 --> 07:33.673
HE'LL NEVER BRING YOU
BACK FROM EXILE.

07:33.773 --> 07:35.299
HE'S HEARD THE STORIES
OF WHAT YOU DID.

07:35.399 --> 07:37.797
THAT WAS
A DIFFERENT TIME
AND A DIFFERENT SOURCE.

07:37.897 --> 07:40.798
STILL, IT'S NOT
GOING TO HAPPEN.

07:40.898 --> 07:42.799
I WOULDN'T BE HERE
IF I WASN'T SURE
OF THAT.

07:42.899 --> 07:45.677
THEN WHAT MAKES WORKING
FOR US ANY BETTER THAN
WORKING FOR HIM?

07:45.777 --> 07:48.386
YOU OUGHT TO LISTEN
BETTER. I DON'T WORK
FOR ANYONE.

07:48.486 --> 07:51.177
WE'D BE EQUALS...
PARTNERS.

07:51.277 --> 07:53.970
AND ONCE THE SOURCE
IS DEAD,

07:54.070 --> 07:55.446
WE'D GO
OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

07:57.321 --> 07:58.739
SO?

08:00.489 --> 08:01.698
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

08:02.615 --> 08:03.989
WHEN I'M READY.

08:08.908 --> 08:12.808
I WANT YOU TO OFFER
THE NEW SOURCE
AN OLIVE BRANCH.

08:12.908 --> 08:16.144
AND IF HE REFUSES?

08:16.244 --> 08:17.770
THEN KEATS
HAS A NEW ALLY,

08:17.870 --> 08:19.453
AND WE HAVE A NEW ENEMY.

08:21.954 --> 08:25.080
GO.

08:26.247 --> 08:29.189
PLENTY OF LEFTOVERS.

08:29.289 --> 08:30.814
PROBABLY WON'T HAVE
TO DO ANY COOKIN'
FOR A WEEK.

08:30.914 --> 08:33.815
I LIKE TO COOK.

08:33.914 --> 08:35.815
WELL, THERE'S, UH,
LESS DISHES TO DO,

08:35.914 --> 08:38.025
AND THAT'S
A GOOD THING,
RIGHT?

08:38.126 --> 08:41.318
I GUESS.

08:41.419 --> 08:42.777
IT'S JUST, UM...

08:42.876 --> 08:44.403
WITH PHOEBE
AND COLE GONE,

08:44.503 --> 08:46.404
IT'S SO QUIET
AROUND HERE.

08:46.504 --> 08:48.796

OOH, SORRY.
AM I INTERRUPTING?

09:08.926 --> 09:10.826
ACTUALLY,
I NEED TO GET
GOING.

09:10.926 --> 09:12.827
THERE'S AN UPSURGE
IN DEMONIC ACTIVITY,

09:12.927 --> 09:14.704
AND THE ELDERS
WANT TO FIGURE
OUT WHY.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.912
WELL, SINCE
THAT DEMONIC ACTIVITY

09:17.012 --> 09:18.748
SPILLED INTO
OUR LIVING ROOM
LAST NIGHT,

09:18.848 --> 09:20.829
I'M ASSUMING
IT HAS SOMETHING
TO DO WITH US.

09:20.929 --> 09:22.890
KEEP AN EYE OUT,
AND I'LL LET YOU KNOW
IF I FIND ANYTHING OUT.

09:23.473 --> 09:26.708
I LOVE YOU.

I LOVE YOU, TOO.

09:29.932 --> 09:33.001

09:35.018 --> 09:38.128

09:38.228 --> 09:39.712
LOOK, I KNOW
I'M NOT PHOEBE,

09:39.812 --> 09:40.835
BUT I AM STILL
YOUR SISTER,

09:40.935 --> 09:42.546
AND YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

09:42.646 --> 09:45.837

09:45.937 --> 09:47.005
IT'S JUST SILLY.

09:47.105 --> 09:48.757

09:48.857 --> 09:51.716
BY A COUPLE OF DAYS,

09:51.816 --> 09:53.132

I GOT MY HOPES UP
A LITTLE.

09:53.232 --> 09:55.966
THAT'S NOT SILLY, HONEY.
YOU WANT KIDS, RIGHT?

09:56.066 --> 09:59.217
YEAH. OF COURSE.

09:59.317 --> 10:00.842
IT'S JUST THAT
WE'VE BEEN TRYING...

10:00.942 --> 10:03.344
FOR A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

I GUESS I WAS
JUST WORRIED

HAVE KIDS.

10:25.075 --> 10:27.226

IN YOUR FUTURE.

10:27.326 --> 10:28.893

I AM LIVING PROOF
THAT MAGIC HAPPENS

ON THE NEW ALLIANCE.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.961

A FOOT INSIDE MY REALM,

HEARD OUR OFFER.

I'M NOT
INTERRUPTING
ANYTHING, AM I?

12:00.063 --> 12:01.879
NO. WE'RE DONE HERE.

12:01.979 --> 12:03.980
ELEVATOR'S
THAT WAY, ROWAN.

12:15.443 --> 12:19.053
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING?

12:19.153 --> 12:21.053
THIS IS EXACTLY
WHY I DON'T WANT
YOU PEOPLE ORBING IN HERE.

12:21.153 --> 12:24.388
YOU PEOPLE? NICE.

12:24.488 --> 12:25.930
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

12:26.030 --> 12:27.347
PHOEBE. I THINK
PIPER NEEDS
TO TALK TO HER.

12:27.447 --> 12:29.888
WELL...YOU MISSED HER.

12:29.988 --> 12:32.057
BUT WHY DON'T YOU
ORB ON OVER
TO THE NEWSPAPER?

12:32.157 --> 12:34.889
I'M SURE THOSE JOURNALISTS
CAN KEEP A SECRET.

12:34.989 --> 12:37.183
JUST TELL HER
I STOPPED BY, OK?

12:37.283 --> 12:39.267
AND DARE I ASK
WHY IS IT SO DARK
IN HERE

12:39.367 --> 12:41.267
IN THE MIDDLE
OF THE DAY?

12:41.367 --> 12:42.892

12:42.992 --> 12:44.268

ADDING TO.

JUST BITE ME.

12:47.912 --> 12:51.078
[Cole] BUH-BYE.

12:53.622 --> 12:56.915
AFTER YOU.

13:04.542 --> 13:07.819
NICE GUY, HUH?

13:07.919 --> 13:10.376
OH, UH, COLE.

13:10.836 --> 13:12.711
YOU A LAWYER?

13:14.002 --> 13:14.986
NO.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.487
WHY?

13:16.587 --> 13:18.071
BECAUSE ONLY
ANOTHER LAWYER
WOULD THINK THAT.

13:18.171 --> 13:21.197
NO, I WAS BEING
SARCASTIC.

13:21.297 --> 13:23.280
ABOUT BEING A LAWYER.

13:23.381 --> 13:24.882
NO. ABOUT THINKING
HE WAS A NICE GUY.

13:25.715 --> 13:26.925
SORRY.
NO...

13:29.006 --> 13:30.091
I'M ROWAN.

13:31.550 --> 13:32.867
PAIGE. NICE
TO MEET YOU.

13:32.967 --> 13:34.908
SO HOW LONG
HAVE YOU
DISLIKED COLE?

13:35.008 --> 13:37.661
OH, EVER SINCE
I FIRST MET HIM.

13:37.761 --> 13:40.161
HA HA HA.

13:40.261 --> 13:41.286
YOU?

13:41.386 --> 13:42.537
EH, PRETTY MUCH
JUST RECENTLY,

13:42.637 --> 13:44.621
EVER SINCE
HE MARRIED MY SISTER.

13:44.721 --> 13:46.038
YOU HAVE ANY SIBLINGS?

13:46.138 --> 13:47.789
OH, YEAH.
MY FAMILY'S REAL BIG.

13:47.889 --> 13:49.681
THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO HAVE
TO BITE YOUR TONGUE.

13:50.598 --> 13:54.014
BEEN THERE, DONE THAT.

13:56.015 --> 13:59.167

13:59.267 --> 14:00.501
I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE
THIS,

14:00.601 --> 14:02.710
BUT WE'VE JUST
RUN OUT OF FLOORS.

14:02.810 --> 14:05.060
ANY CHANCE WE COULD
GET TOGETHER?

14:06.436 --> 14:08.671
MY SISTER--
MY OTHER SISTER--

14:08.771 --> 14:10.712
OWNS THIS NIGHTCLUB
CALLED P3,

14:10.812 --> 14:12.897
AND I'LL BE THERE
LATER IF YOU
WANNA STOP BY.

14:13.021 --> 14:16.297
I'LL DROP IN.

14:16.397 --> 14:17.921
OK.

14:18.021 --> 14:19.357
ARE YOU COMING?

14:21.022 --> 14:22.191
OH, NO.
UNDERGROUND PARKING.

14:28.902 --> 14:32.302
YOU'RE CERTAIN
OF HER IDENTITY?

14:32.402 --> 14:34.219
SHE'S THE SISTER OF
THE SOURCE'S NEW BRIDE.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.927
THAT MAKES HER
A CHARMED ONE.

14:37.027 --> 14:38.928
THIS MIGHT BE
OUR LUCKY DAY.

14:39.028 --> 14:40.929
AND YOU SAID MEETING
WITH THE NEW SOURCE
WOULD BE USELESS.

14:41.029 --> 14:44.223
HE REFUSED YOUR
OFFER, DIDN'T HE?

14:44.323 --> 14:46.056
YES, BUT HE GAVE US SOMETHING
MUCH MORE VALUABLE INSTEAD.

14:46.156 --> 14:49.307
IF WE CAN GET A CHARMED ONE
ON OUR SIDE,

14:49.407 --> 14:51.642
WE CAN USE HER MAGIC
TO TAKE OVER THE UNDERWORLD

14:51.742 --> 14:53.933
BEFORE THE NEW SOURCE CAN.

14:54.033 --> 14:55.933
WE CAN DESTROY HIM
AND ANYONE ELSE WHO OPPOSES US.

14:56.033 --> 14:58.934
YEAH, BUT SHE'S A WITCH.

14:59.034 --> 15:00.228
THEY DON'T CHANGE SIDES
ON A WHIM.

15:00.328 --> 15:02.228
I THINK I CAN GET HER
TO SEE THINGS OUR WAY...

15:02.328 --> 15:05.396
WITH YOUR PERMISSION,
OF COURSE.

15:05.496 --> 15:07.021
BY ALL MEANS.

15:07.121 --> 15:08.830
TAKE WHOMEVER
YOU NEED.

15:21.459 --> 15:25.277
YOUR MYSTERY MAN STILL
PULLING A DISAPPEARING ACT?

15:25.377 --> 15:28.486
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE STOOD ME UP.

15:28.586 --> 15:30.944
WELL, I'M GLAD
I'M NOT DATING ANYMORE.

15:31.044 --> 15:32.905
YEAH, WELL, I SHOULD
HAVE KNOWN BETTER

15:33.005 --> 15:34.166
THAN TO THINK
I COULD MEET A GUY
THROUGH COLE.

15:34.176 --> 15:36.531
PAIGE, I HAVE
2 WORDS FOR YOU:

15:36.631 --> 15:39.532
"BROKEN" AND "RECORD."

15:39.632 --> 15:41.699
IF YOU KEEP THIS UP,

15:41.799 --> 15:43.043
YOU'RE JUST GONNA END UP
PUSHING PHOEBE FURTHER AWAY.

15:43.053 --> 15:45.659
SHE'S RIGHT.

15:45.759 --> 15:46.701
AH, THAT'S MORE
THAN 2 WORDS.

15:46.801 --> 15:48.200
[Phoebe] HI.

15:48.300 --> 15:49.410
DO I STILL GET
FREE DRINKS HERE,

15:49.510 --> 15:50.950
OR DO I
HAVE TO PAY NOW?

15:51.050 --> 15:52.411
WHOA, YOU DON'T
LOOK SO GOOD.

15:52.511 --> 15:53.951
ARE YOU OK?

15:54.051 --> 15:55.287
THAT'S PARTLY
WHY I'M HERE.

15:55.387 --> 15:56.495
I THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST A BUG

15:56.595 --> 15:57.662
AND NOW
I'M NOT SO SURE.

15:57.762 --> 15:59.371
SO I'M WONDERING
IF MAYBE IT HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH,

15:59.471 --> 16:01.456
YOU KNOW, THE SCRATCH.

16:01.556 --> 16:03.247
MAYBE YOU'RE TURNING
INTO A HARPY.

16:03.347 --> 16:05.055
OH, GOD, ARE YOU?

16:06.306 --> 16:07.498
WELL, THAT'S HOW PIPER
TURNED INTO A WENDIGO.

16:07.598 --> 16:09.956
OR WAS IT THE FURY?

16:10.056 --> 16:11.333
I'VE TURNED INTO SO MANY
THINGS I CAN'T KEEP TRACK.

16:11.433 --> 16:14.543
I WOULDN'T WORRY.
YOU CAN'T TURN
INTO A HARPY

16:14.643 --> 16:16.543
JUST BY
GETTING SCRATCHED.

16:16.643 --> 16:17.959
YEAH, BUT STILL,
DO YOU MIND,

16:35.148 --> 16:36.132
A LITTLE,
I THINK.

16:36.232 --> 16:37.758
SO, ANY WORD
FROM THE ELDERS
ON WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:37.858 --> 16:40.966
NO, NOT YET.

16:41.066 --> 16:42.342
WHY, WHAT'S
GOING ON?

16:42.442 --> 16:43.760
A LOT OF BAD GUYS.
APPARENTLY MORE
THAN USUAL.

16:43.860 --> 16:45.967
SHOULD WE
BE WORRIED?

16:46.067 --> 16:46.968
NO. NOT TILL
AFTER DINNER.

16:47.068 --> 16:48.261
YOU WANNA JOIN US?

16:48.361 --> 16:49.261

OK, SURE.
WHY NOT?

16:49.361 --> 16:51.429
I'M NOT GONNA GO.

TRY TO FIND A MOMENT
TO TALK TO PIPER.

17:04.866 --> 17:08.224
WHY, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

17:08.325 --> 17:09.768
NO, NOT REALLY.
I JUST THINK

17:09.867 --> 17:11.069
SHE COULD USE YOUR SUPPORT
ABOUT SOMETHING.

17:11.079 --> 17:12.603

TO YOUR PLACE THIS MORNING

17:12.703 --> 17:14.976

ASKED YOU NOT TO?

THINKING?

17:20.078 --> 17:21.188

TO HELP PIPER.

BEEN FOUND BY SOMEBODY

SHE MIGHT HAVE
BLED TO DEATH.

18:46.648 --> 18:47.548
BUT SHE'S GONNA
BE OK?

18:47.648 --> 18:49.006
YES, AFTER SOME REST,

18:49.106 --> 18:50.758

OUTSIDE OF MY CLUB?

18:54.150 --> 18:56.051

I'M THINKING VAMPIRES.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.350

THAT'D BE DIFFERENT.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.518
NO, THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

19:22.618 --> 19:23.726

IN HUMAN FORM AND NOT
AS A SWARM OF BATS.

TOO POWERFUL.

21:46.160 --> 21:47.396
DON'T YOU THINK I KNOW THAT?!

21:47.496 --> 21:50.063
DAMN IT.

21:50.163 --> 21:51.372
GATHER
THE FACTION LEADERS.

21:53.956 --> 21:55.063
IF THE QUEEN
WANTS A WAR,
SHE'S GOT ONE!

21:55.163 --> 21:56.440
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

21:56.540 --> 21:57.707
TO THE MANOR!
TO HELP SAVE...PAIGE!

22:01.500 --> 22:04.776
MANTICORE.

22:04.876 --> 22:05.902
BITES, BUT DOESN'T FLY.

22:06.002 --> 22:08.067
PHOENIX.

22:08.167 --> 22:09.068
FLIES, BUT DOESN'T BITE.

22:09.168 --> 22:11.570
CHUPACABRA.

22:11.670 --> 22:12.904
GOD BLESS YOU.

22:13.004 --> 22:14.445
FLIES AND BITES,
BUT ONLY ATTACKS
LIVESTOCK.

22:14.545 --> 22:17.238
WHAT ABOUT SHAPESHIFTERS?

22:17.338 --> 22:20.531
WHAT ABOUT THIS
BEING A WASTE OF TIME?

22:20.631 --> 22:23.699
LOOK AT ME. I'M FINE.

22:23.799 --> 22:24.908
LET'S JUST CALL IT
A NIGHT.

22:25.008 --> 22:27.073
PAIGE, IF YOU'RE TIRED,
JUST GO TO BED.

22:27.173 --> 22:28.993
WE'LL WAKE YOU UP
IF WE FIND SOMETHING.

22:29.093 --> 22:31.827
FINE.

22:31.927 --> 22:33.535
I'LL BE ASLEEP.

22:33.635 --> 22:35.177
SHE'S A DELIGHT.

22:36.552 --> 22:39.077
SHE'S BEEN THROUGH
A LOT. SHE JUST
NEEDS SOME REST.

22:39.177 --> 22:40.750
ISN'T THERE SOME WAY
YOU CAN HELP US
NARROW DOWN THE SUSPECTS?

22:40.850 --> 22:43.538
WITH EVERY DEMONIC
FACTION IN TOWN?

22:43.638 --> 22:45.122
IT MAKES IT
KIND OF HARD.

22:45.222 --> 22:47.039
WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS THERE A DEMON CONVENTION
IN SAN FRANCISCO, OR WHAT?

22:47.139 --> 22:50.080
YES. THERE IS A DEMONIC
ELECTORAL COLLEGE.

22:50.180 --> 22:52.499
THEY'VE CALLED A MEETING,

22:52.599 --> 22:53.708
AND THEY'RE VOTING IN
A NEW SOURCE.

22:53.808 --> 22:55.182
HA HA HA!

22:56.142 --> 22:56.850
YOU THINK?

22:59.184 --> 23:00.083
WELL, NOT THE VOTING PART,

23:00.183 --> 23:01.877
BUT MAYBE.

23:01.977 --> 23:03.460
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMEBODY
PRETTY POWERFUL

23:03.560 --> 23:05.545
THAT'S BRINGING TOGETHER
THESE FACTIONS,

23:05.645 --> 23:07.379
WHICH MEANS...

23:07.479 --> 23:08.421
EVIL MAY HAVE
A NEW LEADER.

23:08.521 --> 23:09.963
[Phoebe] COLE!

23:10.064 --> 23:11.271
HONEY, I CAME
AS SOON AS I COULD.

23:11.939 --> 23:12.730
[Phoebe] I'LL BE FINE.

23:15.231 --> 23:15.965
DON'T WORRY.

23:16.065 --> 23:17.008
HOW'S PAIGE?
WHERE IS SHE?

23:17.108 --> 23:18.257
SHE'S SLEEPING.
I HEALED HER.

23:18.357 --> 23:20.550
ARE YOU SURE?

23:20.650 --> 23:22.090
YEAH. WHY?

23:22.190 --> 23:23.776
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT WE'RE UP AGAINST?

23:24.859 --> 23:26.091
BATS THAT BITE
CAN ONLY BE ONE THING--
VAMPIRES.

23:26.192 --> 23:29.386
[Phoebe]
NO, WE RULED THEM OUT.

23:29.486 --> 23:30.761
IT DOESN'T SEEM
LIKE THEIR M.O.

23:30.861 --> 23:32.012
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
A VAMPIRE?

23:32.112 --> 23:33.762
NO, BUT I'VE
READ ABOUT THEM.

23:33.862 --> 23:35.596
WELL, I'VE
DEALT WITH THEM.

23:35.696 --> 23:37.305
YOU CAN TRUST ANNE RICE,
OR YOU CAN TRUST ME.

23:37.405 --> 23:39.389
I THINK HE MIGHT BE RIGHT.

23:39.489 --> 23:40.723
[Leo] WAIT, YOU DEALT
WITH VAMPIRES AS A DEMON?

23:40.823 --> 23:43.432
HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?

23:43.532 --> 23:44.807
I THOUGHT THEY WERE PARIAHS
IN THE UNDERWORLD.

23:44.907 --> 23:46.349
WELL, I WASN'T TOO PICKY
WHO I DEALT WITH.

23:46.449 --> 23:48.851
I DIDN'T CARE
THAT THE SOURCE
HAD BANISHED THEM

23:48.951 --> 23:50.642
FOR SELLING HIM OUT
TO HIS ENEMIES.

23:50.742 --> 23:52.435
BUT WHY ATTACK
A CHARMED ONE NOW?
WHAT DO THEY WANT?

23:52.535 --> 23:54.100
[Cole] IT MUST BE
A POWER STRUGGLE.

23:54.200 --> 23:55.769
THEY MUST BE TRYING
TO OVERTAKE THE UNDERWORLD.

23:55.869 --> 23:57.101
BY KILLING PAIGE?

23:57.201 --> 23:58.244
NO, BY TURNING HER
INTO A VAMPIRE.

24:00.912 --> 24:01.746
PAIGE?

24:04.122 --> 24:05.205
[Piper] PAIGE!

24:08.205 --> 24:11.457
WHERE'D SHE GO?

24:12.083 --> 24:13.041
OH, MY GOD! PAIGE!

24:16.126 --> 24:18.208
WATCH OUT!

24:28.754 --> 24:32.280
[Phoebe] I RANSACKED
THE WHOLE HOUSE,

24:32.380 --> 24:34.032
AND THIS IS ALL I COULD FIND.

24:34.132 --> 24:36.113
OK, SO WHAT DO WE DO
ABOUT THE HOLY WATER?

24:36.213 --> 24:38.157
I CAN GET SOME.

24:38.257 --> 24:40.007
YOU KNOW, THAT STUFF'S
ONLY GONNA, UM...

24:40.214 --> 24:43.868
HELP YOU
FIGHT OFF THE VAMPIRES.

24:43.968 --> 24:45.159
IT'S NOT GONNA
CHANGE PAIGE BACK.

24:45.259 --> 24:47.117
[Piper] YEAH,
I'M WORKING ON THAT.

24:47.217 --> 24:48.869
ACCORDING TO THE BOOK,
IF YOU KILL
A VAMPIRE QUEEN,

24:48.969 --> 24:51.661
THEN ALL HER LITTLE
VAMPIRES DIE WITH HER.

24:51.761 --> 24:53.662
REALLY? INTERESTING.

24:53.762 --> 24:56.370
THEY CERTAINLY DON'T LIKE
TO SPREAD THAT AROUND.

24:56.471 --> 24:59.580
[Phoebe] BUT THAT'S
NOT GONNA WORK,

24:59.681 --> 25:01.247
'CAUSE THEN
IT'LL KILL PAIGE, TOO.

25:01.347 --> 25:02.456
NO, NOT IF SHE HASN'T
BITTEN ANYONE.

25:02.556 --> 25:04.790
APPARENTLY,
THE TRANSFORMATION
ONLY TAKES PLACE

25:04.890 --> 25:07.083
AFTER BLOOD IS SPILLED,

25:07.183 --> 25:08.374
OR IN THIS CASE,
SUCKED.

25:08.474 --> 25:10.417
[Phoebe] OK, SO WE HAVE TO
KILL THE QUEEN, FAST.

25:10.517 --> 25:13.125
HOW DO WE VANQUISH HER?

25:13.225 --> 25:14.418
WITH THE POWER OF 3.

25:14.518 --> 25:15.627
UGH! OF COURSE!
CAN'T ANYTHING BE EASY?

25:15.727 --> 25:18.461
[Piper]
OH, IT GETS WORSE.

25:18.561 --> 25:21.127
VAMPIRES ARE IMMUNE
TO WITCH POWERS.

25:21.227 --> 25:23.296
I'LL GET
THE HOLY WATER

25:23.396 --> 25:25.228
ONCE I FILL IN
THE ELDERS
ABOUT THE NEW SOURCE.

25:25.939 --> 25:27.106
NEW SOURCE?
THERE'S A NEW SOURCE?

25:29.523 --> 25:32.841
YEAH, WE THINK SO.

25:32.941 --> 25:33.883
ANY IDEA WHO IT IS?

25:33.983 --> 25:36.132
NO, NOT YET.

25:36.232 --> 25:37.353
[Piper] OK.
LET'S JUST FOCUS
ON FINDING PAIGE.

25:37.363 --> 25:39.134
SO IF YOU WERE UNDEAD,

25:39.234 --> 25:41.468
WHERE WOULD YOU BE?

25:41.569 --> 25:42.761
CEMETERY.

25:42.861 --> 25:44.094
GREAT. LET'S GO.
WE DON'T GOT
A LOT OF TIME,

25:44.194 --> 25:46.345
AND A BUNCH OF THEM
TO CHECK OUT.

25:46.445 --> 25:48.196
PHOEBE, I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GO.

25:50.236 --> 25:53.137
WHAT?

25:53.237 --> 25:54.890
IT'S TOO DANGEROUS.

25:54.990 --> 25:56.181
WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU FAINT AGAIN,

25:56.281 --> 25:58.058
BUT THIS TIME
IN THE MIDDLE
OF A VAMPIRE ATTACK?

25:58.158 --> 25:59.641
BABY, THAT'S
NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

25:59.741 --> 26:00.641
HOW CAN YOU BE SURE?

26:00.741 --> 26:02.140
I DON'T
WANT TO LOSE YOU.

26:02.240 --> 26:04.225
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE PAIGE.

26:04.325 --> 26:06.309
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
WEREN'T YOU JUST
TELLING US

26:06.409 --> 26:08.518
THAT WE HAD TO SAVE PAIGE?

26:08.618 --> 26:09.644
THAT WAS BEFORE
I HAD ALL THE FACTS.

26:09.744 --> 26:11.311
YOU NEED THE POWER OF 3.

26:11.411 --> 26:12.853
I'M SURE PAIGE
IS NOT GONNA BE
IN A RHYMING MOOD.

26:12.953 --> 26:14.646
[Piper]
SO WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST?

26:14.746 --> 26:17.188
THAT WE LET HER SPEND ETERNITY
AS A VAMPIRE?

26:17.288 --> 26:19.229
SHE'S STILL MY SISTER,

26:19.329 --> 26:20.789
AND THAT DOESN'T CHANGE
BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE SICK.

26:21.497 --> 26:23.790
OR BECAUSE I'M YOUR WIFE.

26:43.796 --> 26:47.530
THE VAMPIRES HAVE CONVERTED
MY WIFE'S SISTER,

26:47.630 --> 26:50.823
A CHARMED ONE.

26:50.923 --> 26:52.250
I'M INTERPRETING THIS
AS AN ACT OF WAR
AGAINST ME.

26:52.260 --> 26:55.199
WAIT A SECOND, NOW.
LET'S NOT OVERREACT.

26:55.299 --> 26:57.076
MAYBE THIS IS SOME KIND
OF A MISUNDERSTANDING.

26:57.176 --> 26:59.451
I DON'T
MISUNDERSTAND ANYTHING.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.301
I WANT THE VAMPIRES
EXTERMINATED,

27:02.886 --> 27:05.159
EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM.

27:05.259 --> 27:08.160
THE VAMPIRES
MULTIPLY TOO FAST.

27:08.260 --> 27:09.746
WE COULD NEVER
GET THEM ALL.

27:09.846 --> 27:12.162
IF WE KILL THE QUEEN...

27:12.262 --> 27:14.288
THEY ALL DIE.

27:14.388 --> 27:15.915
I'VE NEVER
HEARD THAT.

27:16.015 --> 27:17.831
WHAT'S YOUR SOURCE?

27:17.931 --> 27:19.932
ARE YOU QUESTIONING
MY ORDERS?

27:20.264 --> 27:23.641
NO. OF COURSE NOT.

27:27.266 --> 27:30.460
I WANT THE QUEEN.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.168
DISPATCH YOUR FORCES.

27:32.268 --> 27:34.937
TELL THEM TO TORTURE
ANY VAMPIRE THEY SEE.

27:35.269 --> 27:38.338
MAKE THEM TALK.

27:38.438 --> 27:40.313
BUT DON'T FORGET,
MY WIFE IS OUT THERE, TOO.

27:40.605 --> 27:44.272
ANYONE LAYS A CLAW ON HER...

27:45.940 --> 27:47.941
WILL ANSWER TO ME.

27:49.273 --> 27:50.901
LEAVE.

28:00.154 --> 28:03.513
WHAT ABOUT
THE OTHER SISTER?

28:03.613 --> 28:06.304
ARE YOU GONNA LET HER
DIE WITH THE QUEEN?

28:06.404 --> 28:08.279
IT WOULD ELIMINATE
THE CHARMED ONES.

28:08.781 --> 28:10.865
PHOEBE WOULD BE DEVASTATED.

28:14.281 --> 28:15.116
BUT I WOULDN'T BE.

28:17.533 --> 28:19.518
[QUEEN VAMPIRE GROWLING]

28:19.618 --> 28:21.035
AAH!

28:24.869 --> 28:28.020
AHEM...

28:28.120 --> 28:29.186
SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU
DURING DINNER.

28:29.286 --> 28:32.286
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
I'VE HAD BETTER.

28:33.287 --> 28:34.872
IS SHE HERE THEN?

28:36.581 --> 28:38.165
JUST ARRIVED.

28:43.458 --> 28:46.734
SHE'S PERFECT.

28:46.834 --> 28:49.276
SHE'LL FIT RIGHT IN.

28:49.376 --> 28:50.919
I THOUGHT YOU'D LIKE HER.

28:51.292 --> 28:52.419
ARE YOU HUNGRY, MY DEAR?

28:54.795 --> 28:56.629
FAMISHED.

28:58.087 --> 28:59.780
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

28:59.880 --> 29:01.279
NOW, FOR YOUR FIRST MEAL,

29:01.380 --> 29:04.173
I HAVE 2 SAVORY VICTIMS
IN MIND.

29:07.007 --> 29:07.507
ANYTHING FOR YOU, MY QUEEN.

29:10.424 --> 29:12.199
OH.

29:12.299 --> 29:13.450
I WANT YOU TO GO BACK
TO YOUR SISTERS, PAIGE.

29:13.550 --> 29:16.200
TAKE A TASTE
OF YOUR OWN BLOOD.

29:16.300 --> 29:18.411
IT WILL SEAL
YOUR CONVERSION

29:18.511 --> 29:20.201
AND TURN THEM
AS WELL.

29:20.301 --> 29:21.787
THAT'S GENIUS.

29:21.887 --> 29:23.955
WITH THE POWER OF 3
ON OUR SIDE,

29:24.055 --> 29:27.204
THE SOURCE WILL BE
NO MATCH FOR US.

29:27.304 --> 29:29.204
MY SISTERS
ARE VERY POWERFUL.

29:29.304 --> 29:31.331
THEY WON'T JOIN US
WILLINGLY.

29:31.431 --> 29:34.041
I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO IT ALONE.

29:34.141 --> 29:36.249
OH, MY DARLING.

29:36.349 --> 29:38.207
LOOK AROUND YOU.

29:38.307 --> 29:40.601
THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES
ARE FOR.

29:45.769 --> 29:49.253
[Vampire]
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

29:49.353 --> 29:51.671
I HAVE TO GET A MESSAGE
TO THE QUEEN.

29:51.771 --> 29:53.212
WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE IT YOURSELF?

29:53.312 --> 29:54.391
BECAUSE SOMEONE
MIGHT BE FOLLOWING ME.

29:54.401 --> 29:56.673
TELL HER SHE NEEDS
TO LEAVE TOWN, FAST.

29:56.773 --> 29:59.213
THE SOURCE IS--

29:59.313 --> 30:00.191
[Cole]
THE SOURCE IS WHAT?

30:06.859 --> 30:10.317
WHERE'S THE QUEEN, KEATS?

30:14.318 --> 30:17.220
OUCH.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.403
YOU CAN VANQUISH ME
IF YOU WANT,

30:20.363 --> 30:21.638
BUT I'M NOT TELLING YOU
ANYTHING.

30:21.738 --> 30:23.405
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT VANQUISHING YOU
IS THE WORST I CAN DO?

30:26.282 --> 30:26.406
AAH! AAH!

30:29.324 --> 30:30.307
AAAH!

30:30.407 --> 30:31.892
AAH! OH, GOD!

30:31.992 --> 30:33.934
AAH! OH!

30:34.034 --> 30:35.325
SO, LET'S TRY THIS AGAIN.

30:37.368 --> 30:40.494
WHERE'S THE VAMPIRE QUEEN?

30:45.329 --> 30:48.689
THEY'RE NOT HERE.

30:48.789 --> 30:50.229
THEY MUST BE
LOOKING FOR YOU.

30:50.329 --> 30:51.815
DO-GOODERS.

30:51.915 --> 30:53.330
I WAS HOPING
TO GET THIS OVER WITH.

30:53.456 --> 30:56.691
JUST RELAX.

30:56.791 --> 30:58.708
YOU'RE ONLY
INNOCENT ONCE.

30:59.542 --> 31:00.332
BUT I'M STARVING.

31:03.001 --> 31:04.736
I FEEL LIKE
I'VE BEEN WAITING
FOR THIS MOMENT

31:04.836 --> 31:06.334
MY WHOLE LIFE.

31:06.502 --> 31:08.336
WHAT ARE YOU SMILING AT?

31:10.087 --> 31:11.236
I WAS JUST THINKING
OF MY FIRST TIME.

31:11.336 --> 31:14.197
TELL ME ABOUT IT.

31:14.297 --> 31:17.157
IT'S BETTER THAN YOU
CAN POSSIBLY IMAGINE.

31:17.257 --> 31:19.798
DANGER, EXCITEMENT...

31:21.216 --> 31:23.424
THAT WARM GLOW
YOU FEEL AFTERWARDS.

31:24.800 --> 31:27.534
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT.

31:27.634 --> 31:29.341
HOW MANY HAVE YOU HAD?

31:31.219 --> 31:32.702
I DON'T KEEP TRACK.

31:32.802 --> 31:34.911
THE FACES
ALL FADE AWAY.

31:35.011 --> 31:37.370
IT'S THE TASTE
YOU REMEMBER.

31:37.470 --> 31:39.413
AND WHAT WAS I,
JUST FAST FOOD?

31:39.513 --> 31:42.345
OH, HARDLY.

31:43.347 --> 31:46.582
JUST RELAX.

31:46.682 --> 31:49.000
CLEAR YOUR MIND.

31:49.100 --> 31:50.641
YOU ARE A HUNTER NOW.

31:52.268 --> 31:54.642
YOU HAVE THE ABILITY
TO FIND YOUR PREY.

31:56.185 --> 31:57.518
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

31:59.435 --> 32:01.294
YOU WILL.

32:01.394 --> 32:03.352
CLOSE YOUR EYES...

32:04.812 --> 32:06.353
AND FOCUS.
