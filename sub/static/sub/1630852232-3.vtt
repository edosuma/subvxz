00:12.689 --> 00:13.965
ALEX: Getting through
the winter here,

00:14.034 --> 00:15.241
it's always a process
of buying yourself time

00:15.310 --> 00:16.448
against the cold.

00:18.206 --> 00:20.827
You know the cold's always
circling you and squeezing in.

00:22.172 --> 00:23.482
I mean I knew it was
going to be a little risky

00:23.551 --> 00:25.172
coming out here in
the winter like this,

00:25.241 --> 00:28.517
but I, you know, it's a
risk I was willing to take.

00:28.586 --> 00:29.931
But the thing is,

00:30.000 --> 00:33.551
all this wood I got here
is basically useless.

00:33.620 --> 00:35.413
It was a dead tree
that had fallen down,

00:35.482 --> 00:38.413
but I think it got
waterlogged and then it froze.

00:38.482 --> 00:40.034
So it's almost like I have
no wood at this point.

00:43.241 --> 00:45.448
Well, except for my very first
winter here I've never been

00:45.517 --> 00:47.310
in a situation
where it was like,

00:47.379 --> 00:49.827
get firewood or die.

00:49.896 --> 00:52.379
If we do get a
cold snap, that's it.

00:55.758 --> 00:57.724
We're gonna freeze to death.

00:59.413 --> 01:00.689
Yeah, see?

01:00.758 --> 01:02.000
Feel how hollow it is?

01:02.068 --> 01:04.448
Um, This I can tell
is really rotten.

01:04.517 --> 01:06.379
So, the hunt goes on.

01:09.068 --> 01:11.206
Having a hard time
finding firewood.

01:11.275 --> 01:15.241
This is a situation
I was afraid of before
I came out here.

01:15.310 --> 01:17.517
This one might be good.

01:17.586 --> 01:20.137
Although it's wedged
between these trees so good,

01:20.206 --> 01:21.862
maybe it's gonna help me,
maybe it's gonna hurt.

01:21.931 --> 01:23.413
I'll just have to start
cutting it and see.

01:26.068 --> 01:27.482
I, I'm thinking those
trees will pretty much

01:27.551 --> 01:30.896
hold that half of it.

01:30.965 --> 01:35.137
This is super dry,
about as good as it gets.

01:37.310 --> 01:39.275
There we go.

01:39.344 --> 01:41.000
I came out here
and I didn't bring,

01:41.068 --> 01:43.000
you know all of the
advantages of the modern world

01:43.068 --> 01:47.965
with me so
that I could take a risk
to live life more fully.

01:50.241 --> 01:51.517
Whatever the situation is,

01:51.586 --> 01:53.689
I always tell myself
that this is just my life.

01:53.758 --> 01:56.275
I'm putting myself right into
the most dangerous situation...

01:56.344 --> 01:57.793
Alright.

01:57.862 --> 01:59.517
So I have to do the
work to be ready for the

01:59.586 --> 02:00.758
worst possible outcome.

02:00.827 --> 02:02.241
And if I don't,

02:02.310 --> 02:04.241
and I freeze to death
then it's just shame on me.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.551
At Bear Creek,

02:07.620 --> 02:11.275
like one log like this
split up in like four pieces?

02:11.344 --> 02:13.586
That's enough to like
heat my cabin up, you know?

02:13.655 --> 02:15.103
And then the cabin
will stay warm.

02:15.172 --> 02:17.689
You know,
at least half the day.

02:17.758 --> 02:22.655
Here, it's just enough to
make breakfast and dinner.

02:22.724 --> 02:24.965
But I mean that's just
kind of part of the new

02:25.034 --> 02:27.068
lifestyle and adjusting
to living in a tent.

02:27.137 --> 02:29.206
I cook breakfast, I
cook dinner with fire.

02:29.275 --> 02:31.068
Other than that, I
just bundle up and,

02:31.137 --> 02:33.241
and that's just how
I'm gonna have to live.

02:36.689 --> 02:39.241
Got plenty more firewood here
for the future but this is

02:39.310 --> 02:41.620
enough to get started with.

02:43.758 --> 02:45.103
I just gotta think about
getting myself through this

02:45.172 --> 02:47.172
winter in this tent.

02:50.103 --> 02:51.965
It's only a few more months.

02:53.413 --> 02:55.137
ALEX: But you know, when
it's cold enough that you can

02:55.206 --> 02:58.482
freeze to death in one night

02:58.551 --> 03:00.827
then a month's
a pretty long time.

03:08.827 --> 03:10.965
JOHNNY: Living in the city I
didn't feel challenged because

03:11.034 --> 03:13.896
everything I want and
need is at my fingertips.

03:13.965 --> 03:16.724
Being out here I
strive for challenge.

03:16.793 --> 03:20.586
I look for challenge I like
to be challenged every day.

03:24.689 --> 03:27.034
I'm in what I call
my lumber yard.

03:28.655 --> 03:34.517
I'm looking for two boards, uh,

03:34.586 --> 03:38.344
that I can use for
making hunter skis,

03:38.413 --> 03:41.379
so I can kind of travel
a little bit faster,

03:41.448 --> 03:45.413
farther and a little bit
quieter than, uh, snowshoes.

03:45.482 --> 03:47.931
Like this.

03:48.000 --> 03:50.310
I knew you guys
were in here hiding.

03:51.517 --> 03:54.103
Cool, looks like I
can make skis today.

03:55.655 --> 03:59.586
The first thing I'm gonna do
is make them about a half inch

03:59.655 --> 04:02.310
to an inch, uh, narrower.

04:02.379 --> 04:05.931
I think if I have them

04:06.000 --> 04:09.758
with my feet on them just a hair

04:09.827 --> 04:11.793
narrower it's gonna be better.

04:11.862 --> 04:14.241
Alright, time to
start cutting.

04:14.310 --> 04:17.689
So, the hunter skis are
gonna allow me to move more

04:17.758 --> 04:21.275
efficiently and faster
on top of the snow.

04:21.344 --> 04:24.275
The idea behind making skis
originated from wanting to

04:24.344 --> 04:25.965
stalk down caribou
a little bit easier,

04:26.034 --> 04:28.275
because caribou is
my main food source.

04:28.344 --> 04:31.310
You know the caribou; they
move around a lot so if I'm

04:31.379 --> 04:33.344
gonna chase them down for
food it means I gotta move

04:33.413 --> 04:35.310
around a lot.

04:35.379 --> 04:37.517
So, the next thing I
need to do

04:37.586 --> 04:40.931
is plane the tip
and the tail down.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.517
The reason I have to do that
is: in order to bend the tip,

04:43.586 --> 04:45.655
it has to be very thin.

04:45.724 --> 04:48.103
I want it to be a little
bit light weight as well.

04:50.551 --> 04:54.344
Now I'm taking off just
paper-thin shavings,

04:54.413 --> 04:56.827
it's a long process.

04:56.896 --> 04:59.793
Should keep me warm
out here though.

04:59.862 --> 05:04.344
Today was another
record breaking cold.

05:04.413 --> 05:07.482
Woke up to negative
69 degrees.

05:07.551 --> 05:10.793
Uh, every day seems to
get colder and colder.

05:10.862 --> 05:13.310
Building these skis is
pretty straight forward,

05:13.379 --> 05:16.793
except when it comes to
bending the tip of the ski.

05:16.862 --> 05:19.241
And that part's gonna be
a little bit tricky because uh

05:19.310 --> 05:21.344
wood doesn't want to bend,
it wants to break.

05:21.413 --> 05:23.379
Especially out here in these
cold frigid temperatures.

05:23.448 --> 05:26.103
I've never tried to
bend wood before,

05:26.172 --> 05:27.551
so it's gonna be a
challenge and I just gotta

05:27.620 --> 05:29.689
hope that it doesn't crack.

05:33.068 --> 05:35.206
Oh yeah, it's looking good.

05:35.275 --> 05:37.758
That's awesome.

05:37.827 --> 05:39.965
I'm ready to soak
these in some water.

05:40.034 --> 05:42.655
Um, I don't have any more
wood so I pretty much have

05:42.724 --> 05:45.448
to make these work,
make these bend.

05:45.517 --> 05:47.448
If not, I'm gonna have
a tough time making skis

05:47.517 --> 05:48.758
out of something else.

05:48.827 --> 05:50.896
So, just gotta get it
right the first try.

05:53.068 --> 05:55.172
CHRIS: I'm an adrenaline junkie,
it's all about adventure and

05:55.241 --> 05:58.206
it's about living a lifestyle
that no one else can live.

05:58.275 --> 06:01.000
I'm not worried what other
people think of my life.

06:01.068 --> 06:02.482
This life is
what Jess and I love,

06:02.551 --> 06:03.724
and we love doing it.

06:03.793 --> 06:05.931
We're here to stay.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.448
CHRIS: That's the big
tree right there, right?

06:11.517 --> 06:12.827
JESSI: Yeah.

06:12.896 --> 06:15.241
This one right there
and then right next to

06:15.310 --> 06:17.275
me is that secondary birch.

06:17.344 --> 06:18.793
CHRIS: Okay, I'm gonna
start walking into the

06:18.862 --> 06:20.931
woods and I'm gonna use
you as my sight of reference.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.068
JESSI: Okay.

06:23.137 --> 06:25.758
Chris and I travel the
Cosna River a little
bit different than most.

06:25.827 --> 06:28.482
We actually cross
the river on zip-lines.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.655
They're just a lot more
safe than trying to cross

06:31.724 --> 06:34.206
the treacherous river.

06:34.275 --> 06:37.482
CHRIS: All right, straight back.

06:37.551 --> 06:39.793
Right there,
right through here.

06:41.551 --> 06:43.413
JESSI: It'd be really
great if we could install a

06:43.482 --> 06:46.965
couple more zip-lines
in some different spots.

06:47.034 --> 06:48.586
It would make
everything a lot easier,

06:48.655 --> 06:50.689
a lot faster,
a lot more efficient.

06:52.034 --> 06:53.517
CHRIS: So, we're
coming right down in the

06:53.586 --> 06:55.689
middle of two trees,
that's perfect.

06:56.689 --> 06:59.551
Right around 280 to 290 feet,

06:59.620 --> 07:03.034
so hopefully we got enough
cable to make that work.

07:03.103 --> 07:05.896
All right, back
to the other side.

07:05.965 --> 07:10.310
Cool. Long distance.

07:12.034 --> 07:14.068
All right Jess, I found
the tree we're gonna use

07:14.137 --> 07:17.689
over there, and
it looks like 290 feet.

07:17.758 --> 07:19.965
JESSI: Ha! That's far.

07:20.034 --> 07:22.896
CHRIS: Yeah, we'll have to
test it out or something,

07:22.965 --> 07:26.172
but it is a straight line
straight through here and

07:26.241 --> 07:28.068
there's just four big
spruce trees that I want

07:28.137 --> 07:29.517
to take down.

07:29.586 --> 07:31.000
Once we take those
spruce trees out,

07:31.068 --> 07:32.758
we're gonna have
a nice line of sight.

07:32.827 --> 07:34.068
We're gonna take
'em down anyways.

07:34.137 --> 07:35.275
JESSI: Right.

07:35.344 --> 07:36.448
CHRIS: Can you bring
my chainsaw over?

07:36.517 --> 07:38.206
JESSI: Sure, I gotcha.

07:39.620 --> 07:41.310
CHRIS: Awesome.

07:47.655 --> 07:50.000
JESSI: Here you go. All right.

07:50.068 --> 07:51.172
CHRIS: Come check it out.

07:51.241 --> 07:53.000
JESSI: Get to cutting.

07:54.551 --> 07:56.620
CHRIS: All right, so these are
the trees we need to cut down.

07:56.689 --> 07:58.517
I think we should
start with this one.

07:58.586 --> 08:01.758
Drop it out across the river,
then we'll drop this one,

08:01.827 --> 08:03.793
and we'll drop the big one.

08:03.862 --> 08:05.689
We'll take this
tree down right here,

08:05.758 --> 08:08.379
open up some view,
it'll look good.

08:10.965 --> 08:12.551
Gotta be perfect.

08:15.034 --> 08:16.827
I think we're going
on five years now that

08:16.896 --> 08:18.931
we've had our zip-lines up.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.758
The first time we put a
zip-line up we had no idea

08:20.827 --> 08:24.655
what we were doing,
it was simply utilitarian.

08:24.724 --> 08:29.379
It's not leaning the way I
want to, so keep an eye on it.

08:29.448 --> 08:32.517
JESSI: Okay, I'm gonna move.

08:32.586 --> 08:33.965
CHRIS: We have these like,

08:34.034 --> 08:35.586
40 foot riverbanks our
river goes up and down,

08:35.655 --> 08:37.103
and in the winter,
there's overflow,

08:37.172 --> 08:38.517
but if you got a zip-line
you're up above it all and you

08:38.586 --> 08:40.517
just zip on over.

08:41.724 --> 08:43.068
Awesome!

08:43.137 --> 08:46.448
JESSI: Looking good.
CHRIS: That worked out well.

08:46.517 --> 08:48.034
The zip-line
isn't just for today,

08:48.103 --> 08:49.413
it's for tomorrow.

08:49.482 --> 08:50.793
When hunting season gets here,

08:50.862 --> 08:52.241
we're gonna get
out all over the place,

08:52.310 --> 08:55.620
our hunting ground is
going to expand a lot bigger.

08:55.689 --> 08:57.620
If we're going
out and getting two
or three grouse a day,

08:57.689 --> 08:59.068
and then we put these
zip-lines up and can come

08:59.137 --> 09:01.206
home with four or
five grouse in a day?

09:01.275 --> 09:03.172
There it goes!

09:03.241 --> 09:05.689
It's gonna last well
into the winter.

09:06.793 --> 09:09.000
Looks good.

09:09.068 --> 09:11.172
I'm just gonna go down
and check the water out,

09:11.241 --> 09:12.482
see what we're
working with, okay?

09:12.551 --> 09:15.137
JESSI: Right here?
CHRIS: Yup. Solid.

09:15.206 --> 09:16.862
JESSI: Yeah, if this tree
isn't going to take it out,

09:16.931 --> 09:18.344
you're not going to.

09:18.413 --> 09:20.344
CHRIS: Yeah.

09:20.413 --> 09:22.758
It's amazing that that's like
an hour walk from the house.

09:22.827 --> 09:24.068
JESSI: I know it's right here;

09:24.137 --> 09:26.862
we can see the house
yet it's an hour away.

09:26.931 --> 09:29.620
Next step we'll go get the
ropes and sling them across.

09:29.689 --> 09:31.000
CHRIS: Cool.

09:32.517 --> 09:35.344
KALEB: A willingness to try
is far better than any success

09:35.413 --> 09:37.344
you could ever have out here.

09:37.413 --> 09:41.344
Just trying,
just doing in my book

09:41.413 --> 09:42.862
is the most important thing.

09:45.965 --> 09:49.448
BRITTANY: All ready to go?
KALEB: Yup, all ready to go.

09:49.517 --> 09:51.344
Maybe while we're gone you
can clear a spot for us

09:51.413 --> 09:53.034
to stack some wood on the deck.

09:53.103 --> 09:55.413
BRITTANY: Yeah, I
think Gil and I can do that.

09:55.482 --> 09:56.896
KALEB: Awesome. Heat our house.

09:56.965 --> 09:58.448
BRITTANY: It is a chilly day,

09:58.517 --> 10:00.379
so make sure you
keep our girl warm.

10:00.448 --> 10:01.896
KALEB: Will do.

10:01.965 --> 10:03.793
ELOVIE: I'm ready to go, Dad.
KALEB: You're ready to go?

10:03.862 --> 10:05.275
ELOVIE: Yeah.

10:05.344 --> 10:07.034
KALEB: All right. Love ya.
BRITTANY: Love you, too.

10:07.103 --> 10:09.103
KALEB: Have fun.
BRITTANY: You too.
ELOVIE: Can I start it?

10:09.172 --> 10:10.344
KALEB: Will do.

10:10.413 --> 10:11.896
BRITTANY: Bye, baby.
Love you. Have fun.

10:24.896 --> 10:28.758
KALEB: Today we're heading out
to find a new firewood spot.

10:30.965 --> 10:34.068
In the bush here I don't just
have a gas pipe that comes

10:34.137 --> 10:36.379
from the city center
that a furnace runs off of

10:36.448 --> 10:38.620
that I never have to think of.

10:38.689 --> 10:41.241
I have a wood-stove and
a little oil drip stove,

10:41.310 --> 10:42.931
and that's what
heats my house.

10:46.137 --> 10:48.896
I haul that fuel, without
being responsible and going

10:48.965 --> 10:51.034
out in the woods
to get the firewood.

10:51.103 --> 10:54.137
All of that goes away
in about six hours.

11:03.241 --> 11:06.034
I tried to go to my old
firewood lot and the rivers

11:06.103 --> 11:09.034
dictated that
I couldn't make it,

11:09.103 --> 11:12.206
so I decided to just
abandon that lot and

11:12.275 --> 11:14.586
start something new.

11:14.655 --> 11:18.034
I scouted this new firewood
lot from the airplane.

11:18.103 --> 11:21.724
I have a general idea
of where I want to go.

11:23.034 --> 11:24.517
I have not been
there on foot though;

11:24.586 --> 11:27.000
I don't know what it looks
like from the ground.

11:27.068 --> 11:30.000
I don't know what challenges
are gonna await me.

11:34.413 --> 11:35.689
Uh, oh, we're stuck Ellie!

11:35.758 --> 11:38.517
ELOVIE: Oh, we're stuck!

11:42.103 --> 11:43.793
KALEB: Uh, oh,
we're stuck Ellie!

11:43.862 --> 11:46.586
ELOVIE: Oh, we're stuck!

11:46.655 --> 11:48.965
KALEB: We're on
a bank right here.

11:49.034 --> 11:50.517
Oof.

11:50.586 --> 11:55.103
Whoa, yeah, we might wanna do
some shoveling here, Ellie.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.724
ELOVIE: Why?

11:56.793 --> 11:58.344
KALEB: Because we
can go off this bank,

11:58.413 --> 12:00.310
but we'd never get back up
it with a load of firewood.

12:01.965 --> 12:03.206
And I got stuck!

12:04.413 --> 12:06.344
[muffled talking]

12:06.413 --> 12:08.310
KALEB: Alright, I'm
gonna get my parka off,

12:09.241 --> 12:11.793
we're gonna do some work.

12:11.862 --> 12:13.896
Yeah.

12:13.965 --> 12:19.482
So, we gotta make
a trail down onto the river
where no one else has been

12:19.551 --> 12:24.482
and in order to
access our firewood.

12:24.551 --> 12:27.241
So, we're gonna learn how
to build a ramp today.

12:27.310 --> 12:29.206
Shovel some snow.

12:31.413 --> 12:35.241
We'll just shovel it right out
from under the snow machine
and that'll help us get unstuck.

12:35.310 --> 12:39.379
I have to figure
out a way to get from
the bank onto the creek,

12:39.448 --> 12:42.000
and it's a good four,
five-foot-tall drop.

12:42.068 --> 12:47.793
I have to be thinking how am
I gonna get up onto the bank
with a heavy load behind me,

12:47.862 --> 12:53.000
when the best thing to do is
just stop before the problem
arises and build a ramp?

12:54.344 --> 12:55.655
Pull that shovel!

12:55.724 --> 12:58.275
Whoa, it buried you!

12:59.137 --> 13:00.413
ELOVIE: Whoa!

13:00.482 --> 13:02.689
KALEB: So, this is just
part of trail making.

13:02.758 --> 13:07.034
You build ramps and we got the
snow machine stuck so we gotta
get the snow machine unstuck.

13:07.103 --> 13:09.275
So, we're accomplishing
two tasks.

13:09.344 --> 13:10.482
ELOVIE: Dad!

13:10.551 --> 13:12.241
KALEB: You can turn the skis?

13:12.310 --> 13:14.448
ELOVIE: They can go up and down.

13:14.517 --> 13:16.068
KALEB: Alright Ellie.

13:16.137 --> 13:17.517
ELOVIE: What?

13:17.586 --> 13:18.551
KALEB: You wanna help get
the snow machine unstuck?

13:18.620 --> 13:20.310
ELOVIE: Yeah!

13:20.379 --> 13:24.172
KALEB: I'll have you
run the throttle and
I'll pull on the ski.

13:24.241 --> 13:26.172
Hopefully I've shoveled
this out enough.

13:26.241 --> 13:30.896
Let me pull my,
let me pull my gear off.

13:30.965 --> 13:36.620
You just push the throttle
until the track starts moving
and I'll pull on the ski.

13:36.689 --> 13:39.827
I'll tell you when to
go, and when I tell you
to stop you just let go.

13:39.896 --> 13:41.965
Kay?

13:42.034 --> 13:43.724
Alright Ellie,
give it some throttle!

13:43.793 --> 13:45.448
I'm pulling on the ski!

13:45.517 --> 13:48.482
All the way until
the track goes, more!

13:48.551 --> 13:50.551
More throttle! More!

13:50.620 --> 13:54.827
Come on, more throttle!

13:54.896 --> 13:57.586
Just hammer on it!

13:58.551 --> 14:00.344
There you go, we're moving!

14:00.413 --> 14:02.655
ELOVIE: Did it!
KALEB: You did it!

14:02.724 --> 14:05.034
ELOVIE: Yay!
KALEB: Good job!

14:05.103 --> 14:08.586
You got me unstuck and you got
to be first tracks on the ramp.

14:08.655 --> 14:10.344
How exciting is that?

14:10.413 --> 14:14.068
ELOVIE: So excited. Yes!

14:14.137 --> 14:16.241
KALEB: Alright,
this ramp is done.

14:16.310 --> 14:18.586
Continue on down the creek.

14:20.241 --> 14:21.758
JESSI: There's
a feeling out here that

14:21.827 --> 14:24.379
I've never felt anywhere
else in the entire world.

14:24.448 --> 14:27.275
When I succeed out here
it's a celebration.

14:27.344 --> 14:31.689
It means that much more,
and there's just, there's
no other feeling like it.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.379
CHRIS: Wow.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.379
JESSI: The, the tree
directly behind you,

14:44.448 --> 14:45.862
is that
the tree that we picked?

14:45.931 --> 14:47.137
CHRIS: Yeah, this is the one.

14:47.206 --> 14:49.586
I'm gonna clear
a little brush real quick.

14:49.655 --> 14:51.620
Damn, whew it's cold.

14:57.413 --> 14:59.172
CHRIS: Oh. Ah!
JESSI: Oh, no!

15:00.586 --> 15:02.965
That's Chris's first hatchet
that he's ever gotten,

15:03.034 --> 15:06.103
and he just lost the
whole head in the snow.

15:07.724 --> 15:11.137
CHRIS: That's a bummer.
It's straight down.

15:11.206 --> 15:15.000
It's, it's gone.
That's my first axe.

15:15.068 --> 15:16.862
JESSI: I know.

15:16.931 --> 15:19.586
CHRIS: Well, hopefully
this is the only thing
bad that happens today.

15:19.655 --> 15:24.103
I'd rather lose an axe
head then lose it going
across on a zipline.

15:24.172 --> 15:25.344
JESSI: I guess.

15:25.413 --> 15:26.586
CHRIS: Well, I'm gonna
start tying ropes.

15:26.655 --> 15:27.586
I'll be over in a minute.

15:27.655 --> 15:29.275
JESSI: Okay.

15:29.344 --> 15:33.310
I'm not even allowed
to use that axe when
I'm chopping wood.

15:33.379 --> 15:37.448
So, Chris and I's
plan is with one zipline
to go all the way

15:37.517 --> 15:40.172
across the river
to the peninsula,

15:40.241 --> 15:43.793
and then across the river
again right to our cabin.

15:43.862 --> 15:46.413
CHRIS: Ooh, I'm breaking
through the overflow down here.

15:46.482 --> 15:48.344
JESSI: Okay.

15:48.413 --> 15:52.103
So, what we're gonna
do is we're gonna string
a rope across first to tell

15:52.172 --> 15:54.586
exactly what the distance is,

15:54.655 --> 15:58.000
because we only have
300 foot of cable.

15:58.068 --> 16:00.275
CHRIS: Nice.

16:00.344 --> 16:03.724
JESSI: So, if this
zipline is over 300 feet...

16:03.793 --> 16:05.965
CHRIS: Oh, that's stretchy.
JESSI: Yeah.

16:06.034 --> 16:07.551
We're not going to
be able to do it.

16:10.310 --> 16:12.620
Moment of truth!

16:13.793 --> 16:17.448
15-feet, ten feet,
five feet!

16:19.448 --> 16:23.275
Yeah!
We made it!

16:23.344 --> 16:24.275
I'm trying to.

16:24.344 --> 16:25.551
CHRIS: I'm coming.

16:25.620 --> 16:28.379
JESSI: Get it.
Look at all this extra rope!

16:28.448 --> 16:29.551
CHRIS: Wow.

16:29.620 --> 16:30.724
JESSI: We're gonna make it!

16:30.793 --> 16:32.103
CHRIS: We'll tie the cable on,

16:32.172 --> 16:33.551
and I'll start pulling
it to the other side.

16:33.620 --> 16:35.931
JESSI: Oh, my goodness.

16:36.000 --> 16:39.137
ALEX: This isn't me going out
on a weekend to do something
to blow off some steam,

16:39.206 --> 16:43.689
this is nature compelling
me to do something
for fear of my life.

16:43.758 --> 16:47.689
Alaska winters doesn't
give a crap about
your, um, your comfort.

16:47.758 --> 16:48.793
You know?

16:50.482 --> 16:52.551
It's really nice and,
and warm in here.

16:52.620 --> 16:54.517
Sixty degrees.

16:54.586 --> 16:57.827
I usually by this time
of day I would uh, I would
have let the fire die out.

16:57.896 --> 17:01.310
I still got a fire going
because I've been melting ice.

17:01.379 --> 17:05.551
Um, just this ice here
I gathered from the lake.

17:05.620 --> 17:07.482
First you gotta melt
this down to water,

17:07.551 --> 17:10.586
and then bring
the water up to a boil
so it's safe to drink.

17:10.655 --> 17:12.724
But I was thinking
if I go to the lake,

17:12.793 --> 17:15.241
then I can drill down
and just get to the water.

17:15.310 --> 17:18.793
Then I won't have to use
near as much wood just
to, just to melt it.

17:20.517 --> 17:23.965
A lot less wood I
gotta cut and just help
me be more efficient.

17:24.034 --> 17:27.034
Grab a few tools like my
shovel and load up my sled.

17:28.275 --> 17:30.413
Head on down to the lake.

17:36.137 --> 17:39.275
ALEX: And when I came out
here and I only came with,

17:39.344 --> 17:42.000
you know,
manual tools instead
of bringing gas tools.

17:42.068 --> 17:43.620
It was for a reason.

17:46.068 --> 17:49.000
So, I'm just gonna test here.

17:51.068 --> 17:54.689
I wanted to put myself in a
situation to where the work
would be kind of daunting and

17:54.758 --> 17:58.689
insurmountable enough
that I would have to
find new ways to think,

18:00.172 --> 18:03.241
and new ways to, uh,
adapt to the situation.

18:06.344 --> 18:09.586
You know I could say oh yeah,
it's about the journey not
the destination but that's

18:09.655 --> 18:12.620
just kind of meaningless
words if I don't
actually do the work.

18:16.413 --> 18:18.965
Okay, I think that's good.

18:19.034 --> 18:20.586
I got a few tools.

18:20.655 --> 18:24.172
I've used this auger a bit and
I found it kind of hard to use.

18:24.241 --> 18:27.034
Uh, I'm going to try it again.

18:30.482 --> 18:34.413
The good thing about the
auger is it drills a hole and
I can just go straight down.

18:36.137 --> 18:39.413
Should be the most efficient
tool for cutting a hole.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.586
Doesn't seem to be
making any progress at all.

18:50.551 --> 18:52.862
It's mostly just
moving wider and wider.

18:52.931 --> 18:55.275
It's not really getting deeper.

18:55.344 --> 18:57.068
You know what,
what could be wrong with it,

18:57.137 --> 18:59.241
that would make it
not cut efficiently.

18:59.310 --> 19:01.482
I don't know.

19:16.482 --> 19:19.172
Yeah, this thing's just
not making any progress.

19:20.379 --> 19:22.517
I don't know about
this [bleep] thing.

19:26.586 --> 19:30.172
ALEX: I don't know
about this [bleep] thing.

19:30.241 --> 19:35.172
Maybe I gotta keep
kinda making a hole in
the middle or something?

19:37.413 --> 19:41.379
The only time I ever use any
of these tools and really
do anything with ice was

19:41.448 --> 19:44.000
a couple months ago when
I was at the Teklanika River.

19:46.137 --> 19:50.137
So, you know this is outside
of my, you know, experience.

19:51.793 --> 19:54.068
Do these things always
take that much effort?

19:54.137 --> 19:56.103
Is it always this slow?

19:56.172 --> 19:57.275
Is ice usually this thick?

19:57.344 --> 19:59.793
I don't know.

19:59.862 --> 20:04.862
So, I just gotta slow
it down, take my time and,
uh, just try to learn here.

20:04.931 --> 20:08.896
Otherwise, I'm going
to start blowing steam
out my ears, you know?

20:08.965 --> 20:11.896
I just try to, try
to be patient with it.

20:15.689 --> 20:19.965
I didn't come out here to
Deadman Lake just to, uh,
do the same old same old,

20:20.034 --> 20:22.758
I came out here
because I wanted to grow,
I wanted to change myself.

20:24.758 --> 20:27.137
I knew I wanted to
challenge myself.

20:27.206 --> 20:32.206
So, if I want to do something
I just throw myself into
the situation headfirst

20:32.275 --> 20:35.137
and you know,
face real dangers.

20:39.586 --> 20:42.241
Because, to me, that, that's
the full experience of life.

20:55.344 --> 20:57.862
[bleep], how deep are we?

21:02.655 --> 21:04.413
Yeah, I'm just thinking,

21:04.482 --> 21:08.034
I'm not really making
any, any progress down
anymore with the bar.

21:08.103 --> 21:11.551
It's getting real narrow
and I just don't have a lot
of room to really get at it.

21:11.620 --> 21:15.206
In order to get deeper
I'm really gonna have
to make it twice as wide so

21:15.275 --> 21:18.241
I can get my whole
body down in there.

21:18.310 --> 21:22.896
And, uh, I'm also like,
pretty, pretty exhausted.

21:25.758 --> 21:30.206
It's a battle of me versus
the ice but um I'll come back
with more energy tomorrow.

21:30.275 --> 21:32.551
Bring the reinforcements.

21:35.241 --> 21:38.448
JOHNNY: What interests me
is being one with nature.

21:38.517 --> 21:40.206
Getting back to
the basics of life.

21:40.275 --> 21:41.689
You know I admire
the ways of the past.

21:41.758 --> 21:44.068
I admire the simplicity.

21:49.000 --> 21:53.482
JOHNNY: Okay, that's
a lot of ash build up.

21:53.551 --> 21:58.482
The last time I used this
was when I boiled my traps
and went trapping last year.

21:58.551 --> 22:00.758
Today I'm not boiling the traps,

22:00.827 --> 22:07.172
I am boiling and steaming the
tips of skis so I can bend them.

22:07.241 --> 22:11.724
So, out here in the
middle of nowhere I don't
have motorized vehicles.

22:11.793 --> 22:15.482
Snow machines,
I don't have four wheelers,
I don't have side-by-sides.

22:15.551 --> 22:18.000
It's easy to take for granted
methods of transportation,

22:18.068 --> 22:21.068
you know when you compare
the city to living out here.

22:21.137 --> 22:22.551
Uh, it's simple,

22:22.620 --> 22:24.275
you get in your car
and drive to your store.

22:24.344 --> 22:26.034
But I don't have that luxury.

22:26.103 --> 22:29.758
So, I need to make
something efficient to
get to my food source.

22:29.827 --> 22:33.413
Skis are soaking,
fine line between
steaming and boiling.

22:33.482 --> 22:35.275
I'm gonna let these
soak in the water

22:35.344 --> 22:38.137
for a while and kinda let
that water penetrate the wood.

22:38.206 --> 22:43.034
And while they're doing
that I'm going to step
out and make a frame.

22:43.103 --> 22:46.000
JOHNNY: Thatta girl!
Yeah, get it!

22:46.068 --> 22:49.758
Get it girl!
Come on, come on!
Thank you.

22:49.827 --> 22:52.206
This frame is
essentially just a mold,

22:52.275 --> 22:56.103
and this mold is what's
going to allow me to bend
the tip of the skis.

22:56.172 --> 22:59.379
What I do is I take the ski
after it's been steaming,

22:59.448 --> 23:03.551
I stick it in between
here and slowly bend it,

23:03.620 --> 23:05.655
and that will create
the tip of the ski.

23:05.724 --> 23:07.482
When it comes to
caribou hunting,

23:07.551 --> 23:09.689
you know the caribou
are my life out here.

23:09.758 --> 23:14.034
They provide me with, you
know over 90% of my food.

23:14.103 --> 23:17.586
I need to be able
to track them down,

23:17.655 --> 23:21.103
catch up with them 'cause
they're always on the move.

23:21.172 --> 23:23.206
They're always staying one
step ahead of the wolves.

23:23.275 --> 23:25.551
And um, I need to think
like the wolves, you know?

23:25.620 --> 23:27.862
Be able to move
fast and efficient.

23:29.137 --> 23:31.482
This is the mold now,
that's complete, um,

23:31.551 --> 23:33.000
it's going to be pretty tricky.

23:33.068 --> 23:35.517
It's both cold and very dry,

23:35.586 --> 23:38.931
and when I take that
ski from the steaming
water if I don't bend

23:39.000 --> 23:43.586
it in seconds, um,
it's going to stiffen
up and it'll crack.

23:43.655 --> 23:48.206
It's a very all
or nothing process.

23:48.275 --> 23:53.206
Uh, I wanna see
where these are at in
terms of flexibility,

23:53.275 --> 23:55.793
and the only way to
figure that out is to
toss it in the mold and

23:55.862 --> 23:58.586
start to see
if it wants to give,
if it wants to bend,

23:58.655 --> 24:00.689
and just kinda see
where we're at with it.

24:05.965 --> 24:10.793
The more I move this piece
here the more of a camber
I'm going to make in the ski,

24:10.862 --> 24:14.827
the more likely it is
to break so I have to
move it up very slowly.

24:14.896 --> 24:19.137
Because this is what's
giving me the opposite
pressure to these two pieces.

24:19.206 --> 24:21.965
So, it's a delicate balance
of how steep you want it and

24:22.034 --> 24:24.689
how big of a risk you want
to take before the ski cracks.

24:32.689 --> 24:34.965
Don't break, don't break.

24:38.034 --> 24:40.275
JOHNNY: Don't break.
Don't break.

24:45.620 --> 24:46.758
JOHNNY: That's amazing.

24:46.827 --> 24:49.482
Wow, this worked
out really well.

24:49.551 --> 24:51.206
Yeah, they got a lot of
character on them right now.

24:51.275 --> 24:54.896
You can see the red from the
rust that was in the cauldron,

24:54.965 --> 24:56.896
and you can see burn right here.

24:56.965 --> 24:59.448
That's when the flame
came up and hit this canvas

24:59.517 --> 25:02.344
and, uh, kissed that
ski when I wasn't here.

25:02.413 --> 25:03.413
But that's character ya know?

25:03.482 --> 25:04.931
That's the stuff I like.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.827
Every time I see that, I'm
gonna remember this moment and

25:06.896 --> 25:09.758
I'm gonna remember being right
here and making these skis.

25:09.827 --> 25:12.689
If I bought a pair of skis
in the store, they wouldn't
have that character.

25:12.758 --> 25:14.068
Anything I buy in the store,

25:14.137 --> 25:15.758
if they get burned
or scratched,

25:15.827 --> 25:19.068
I get upset because
I worked hard to make money

25:19.137 --> 25:22.827
to pay for those and
that's very upsetting
to pay for something,

25:22.896 --> 25:26.482
doing a job you don't
really care for and then
to, to lose out on it,

25:26.551 --> 25:29.275
so that's a benefit of
making your own stuff.

25:29.344 --> 25:31.931
The benefits to
self-reliance.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.034
So, in order to
do the second ski,

25:34.103 --> 25:36.965
I have to put it in here,
but I have to remove this

25:37.034 --> 25:42.482
fulcrum, and when I do
that this ski is gonna
come back and relax.

25:42.551 --> 25:45.793
So now when I put
the second ski in,
I have bend both of them.

25:45.862 --> 25:47.241
So, it is a little tricky.

25:47.310 --> 25:48.758
I risk not only
breaking one,

25:48.827 --> 25:50.931
but I risk breaking
both of them.

25:53.551 --> 25:55.448
Ooh, that was close.

25:55.517 --> 25:57.482
Starting to hear some pop.

25:57.551 --> 25:58.758
I've gone too far.

25:58.827 --> 26:00.655
That's as far as I can go.

26:00.724 --> 26:01.931
It looks pretty good.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.655
I don't think I need
to push it anymore.

26:03.724 --> 26:06.103
I'll leave it as is,
and that's that.

26:06.172 --> 26:09.137
What I gotta do now
is I gotta get these inside
because they're gonna freeze.

26:09.206 --> 26:12.344
These are soaking wet,
uh, it's negative 35.

26:12.413 --> 26:15.482
These are gonna freeze
out here so I gotta take
this thing inside ASAP.

26:19.482 --> 26:21.586
CHRIS: I remember when
I first started out here,

26:21.655 --> 26:23.448
I couldn't plan for tomorrow.

26:23.517 --> 26:25.275
I just took care of today.

26:31.862 --> 26:33.310
CHRIS: We're hooking up
the cable to the rope,

26:33.379 --> 26:34.724
and then I'm just
gonna pull the rope from

26:34.793 --> 26:36.758
the other side and bring
it all the way over.

26:36.827 --> 26:40.137
The cable's gonna hang out
here with Jess and then
once it gets to the end,

26:40.206 --> 26:43.379
we'll loop it around
the tree, and we'll pull it
tight with the come along.

26:43.448 --> 26:46.413
Okay, I am gonna
head to the middle.

26:46.482 --> 26:48.310
And then start
taking it down to the river.

26:48.379 --> 26:51.344
Once I get it down to the river,
I'm gonna let go of the rope.

26:51.413 --> 26:54.310
I'm gonna climb up the hill,
and then continue pulling it.

26:54.379 --> 26:55.655
JESSI: I want you to be vocal.

26:55.724 --> 26:57.068
CHRIS: Yeah.
I'll keep hollering.

26:57.137 --> 26:59.172
I'll let you know,
make sure everything's safe.

26:59.241 --> 27:01.689
Okay.
I'm headed over.

27:04.448 --> 27:09.137
JESSI: Neither myself
alone, or Chris, we do not
go alone down to the river.

27:10.931 --> 27:12.827
It doesn't matter
if it's the summer.

27:12.896 --> 27:15.068
It doesn't matter
if it's the winter.

27:15.137 --> 27:16.931
The river's always the
most dangerous place to go,

27:17.000 --> 27:18.965
so you don't wanna
go there alone.

27:20.379 --> 27:22.551
He's got the cable.

27:22.620 --> 27:24.275
CHRIS: That's good!

27:24.344 --> 27:26.931
JESSI: Doing this,
Chris has gotta go alone,

27:27.000 --> 27:31.344
however, I can see him
so that makes me feel a little
bit better that I can see him.

27:31.413 --> 27:33.517
Okay!

27:33.586 --> 27:36.275
CHRIS: These are gonna hold
everything so I'm just gonna
do a quick visual inspection,

27:36.344 --> 27:39.137
make sure there's no breaks.

27:39.206 --> 27:43.206
JESSI: This is double
the length of any zipline
that we've built before.

27:43.275 --> 27:47.241
I mean this is a long one and
it crosses the river twice.

27:47.310 --> 27:49.827
Last time that we
put in a zipline...

27:49.896 --> 27:52.310
CHRIS: Now I'm just
gonna pull it tight.

27:52.379 --> 27:55.103
JESSI: He did not
double-check the clamps.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.344
And he almost lost our snow
machine down into the icy river,

28:01.413 --> 28:05.482
so just double-check
this this time.

28:05.551 --> 28:08.517
I still have a couple feet left.

28:08.586 --> 28:10.689
CHRIS: Not much though.
Just enough.

28:10.758 --> 28:12.275
JESSI: Just enough.

28:12.344 --> 28:14.758
CHRIS: Just pull it off there.

28:14.827 --> 28:17.275
JESSI: Alright, let's
put it around a tree.

28:26.206 --> 28:28.137
CHRIS: One, two, and heave!

28:28.206 --> 28:30.206
Oh, I see it's stuck
right there in the middle.

28:31.896 --> 28:34.034
JESSI: Hey, there you go.
CHRIS: Will you pull on it?

28:35.793 --> 28:37.034
Awesome.

28:37.103 --> 28:38.344
JESSI: Alright, I'm letting go?
CHRIS: Yup.

28:38.413 --> 28:39.827
JESSI: I'm letting loose.

28:39.896 --> 28:41.206
CHRIS: Wow.
JESSI: What is that?

28:41.275 --> 28:43.034
CHRIS: That took a lot.

28:43.103 --> 28:44.551
I think we should
pick this up tomorrow.

28:44.620 --> 28:45.758
We're losing light
pretty quick.

28:45.827 --> 28:47.379
JESSI: Yeah?

28:47.448 --> 28:48.862
CHRIS: My plan
for the morning is,
I'm just gonna come out.

28:48.931 --> 28:52.517
I'm essentially gonna hook
this come along on here,

28:52.586 --> 28:54.551
hook it up to that birch
tree that's back there,

28:54.620 --> 28:57.793
and then we'll pull it and
we'll start sticking some
shims up underneath it.

28:57.862 --> 28:59.655
JESSI: Cool.

29:02.793 --> 29:06.965
KALEB: What speaks to
my heart is being able to
get outside and adventure.

29:07.034 --> 29:10.896
KALEB: To go out and
come home rejuvenated
and your soul is happy.

29:10.965 --> 29:12.379
I thrive on that.

29:13.827 --> 29:16.068
Alright Ellie.

29:16.137 --> 29:17.689
I think this is the spot.

29:17.758 --> 29:19.827
I see a bunch of dead trees.

29:19.896 --> 29:23.275
We got a good bank here on
the ice where we can work.

29:23.344 --> 29:25.344
So, I think this'll be a great
spot, what do you think?

29:25.413 --> 29:28.034
ELOVIE: Yeah.
KALEB: Yeah.

29:32.310 --> 29:34.655
I'm gonna get some
trees cut down, Ellie.

29:34.724 --> 29:37.379
I want you to sit
on the snow machine.

29:37.448 --> 29:40.344
I'll get three or four of
them down and then we'll
start processing 'em.

29:41.241 --> 29:44.103
30 below this morning.

29:44.172 --> 29:46.689
I don't know what it
is now, but it's cold.

29:46.758 --> 29:49.551
Face all frosty.

29:53.172 --> 29:55.172
You're clear, Ellie?

29:55.241 --> 29:57.103
I'm knocking this tree down.

30:08.655 --> 30:10.586
Oh man, this is a nice tree.

30:10.655 --> 30:12.034
No rot in it.

30:12.103 --> 30:13.931
It fell in the right direction.

30:14.000 --> 30:15.517
This is awesome.

30:15.586 --> 30:18.965
Just working on getting myself
a bit of a trail back here.

30:19.034 --> 30:23.310
I'm gonna drop this tree
down and then I'll skid it
out with the snow machine.

30:23.379 --> 30:25.206
The leaner's a
potential health hazard.

30:25.275 --> 30:27.724
If it was to fall
when I was underneath,

30:27.793 --> 30:29.448
there's no more Kaleb Rowland.

30:29.517 --> 30:31.724
Game over. Lights out.

30:38.586 --> 30:41.517
And there are some trees
that are ready to fall over.

30:48.103 --> 30:53.448
The easiest thing to do
at a woodlot is just get all
the easy stuff fallen first,

30:53.517 --> 30:54.931
and I did that.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.448
I felled a tree.

30:56.517 --> 30:59.517
It fell right now onto my
turnaround staging area.

30:59.586 --> 31:01.758
I was able to cut it,
split it, buck it up.

31:01.827 --> 31:04.896
Get it ready to go without
having to do any extra work.

31:04.965 --> 31:06.000
There we go.

31:06.068 --> 31:07.689
But, as the easy
stuff goes away,

31:07.758 --> 31:10.689
I have to start yarding
the trees out with the snow

31:10.758 --> 31:13.793
machine where I have good
ground to split things.

31:13.862 --> 31:16.724
Gonna get this strap under
here and yank this log out.

31:18.379 --> 31:20.413
See if she goes anywhere.

31:23.137 --> 31:26.241
[reverse beep]

31:26.310 --> 31:30.172
But all these limbs and
stuff that are stuck in
the ground and frozen in,

31:30.241 --> 31:32.517
they don't like to give up.

31:34.068 --> 31:37.206
Come on you stubborn bugger,
don't make me cut you in half.

got bad attitudes and

32:02.689 --> 32:05.000
they don't like
doing what I tell them to.

32:05.068 --> 32:08.413
Fortunately, I have
a badder attitude.

32:08.482 --> 32:12.413
I think it's time for a fire,
a nice big pile of slash.

32:12.482 --> 32:14.862
Time to torch it.

32:14.931 --> 32:18.793
Out here in the woods,
you take every moment you
can get with your kids.

32:18.862 --> 32:20.344
You know it's cold out.

32:20.413 --> 32:22.965
It's a big whoopty-doo to bring
your kids out in the cold.

32:23.034 --> 32:25.000
Gotta make sure they're warm,

32:25.068 --> 32:27.655
their gear's
tucked in just right,

32:27.724 --> 32:29.172
all this stuff and it,

32:29.241 --> 32:32.241
it makes it complicated
to bring 'em out.

32:32.310 --> 32:33.896

are able to go out,

They look good.

33:36.862 --> 33:40.379
The moment of truth to see
if they hold their shape.

33:40.448 --> 33:41.862
What do you think, Java?

33:41.931 --> 33:43.724
Is it gonna work?

33:43.793 --> 33:45.068
Alright, let's try it.

JOHNNY: Yeah, they

33:56.103 --> 33:58.068
They're, they're

They have dried into that
position and it, it seems
like they're there to stay,

34:00.620 --> 34:04.275
but they have a very
obnoxious squared off edge.

34:04.344 --> 34:07.241
So, what I need to do next,
is to make a point.

34:07.310 --> 34:11.586
That way when I'm traveling
through snow that point's
gonna make it break through the

34:11.655 --> 34:14.689
snow a lot easier,
versus having this flat edge.

34:16.793 --> 34:18.827
Traditional ski-makers,
when they would
shape the tip,

34:18.896 --> 34:21.551
they would make some
sort of bulb or ornament

34:21.620 --> 34:24.103
on the end and that's
what made it their ski.

34:24.172 --> 34:25.413
It's their signature.

34:25.482 --> 34:26.827
I'm not gonna get fancy
with these out here,

34:26.896 --> 34:28.862
because these are gonna
get a lot of abuse,

34:28.931 --> 34:33.344
but one thing I'm noticing,
on the end of my ski here
I have the rust-color red.

34:33.413 --> 34:37.862
It just kinda happened
to work out that way and, uh,
that's gonna be my signature.

34:37.931 --> 34:42.310
So, these are the caribou
shin-hides that I'll
be putting on the bottom.

34:42.379 --> 34:44.724
I have to make sure that
they're the right direction,

34:44.793 --> 34:47.758
so I slide forward
and not backwards.

34:47.827 --> 34:51.379
I harvested a couple
caribou this winter and
it's my responsibility

34:51.448 --> 34:53.482
and my duty to use all parts.

34:53.551 --> 34:57.586
So, if I can use
these shin-hides for
the bottom of my skis,

34:57.655 --> 34:59.448
you know that's something
to take advantage of.

35:00.689 --> 35:03.103
I'm going to make
two holes in the ski.

35:03.172 --> 35:05.827
I'm going to countersink
around the hole and that
means it'll be a little

35:05.896 --> 35:08.965
hole for this nut to live in.

35:09.034 --> 35:11.965
And this'll actually work
better too because the nuts

35:12.034 --> 35:13.551
will sit flush with
the bottom of the ski,

35:13.620 --> 35:16.275
and they won't catch any snow,
they won't be hitting the hides.

35:16.344 --> 35:18.068
They'll be nice and flush.

35:18.137 --> 35:21.551
They'll live embedded
in the wood of the ski,
versus sticking out.

35:24.517 --> 35:29.275
It all starts with an idea,
and I take the idea and then
I craft it and I build it.

35:29.344 --> 35:31.103
These are skills you
can't take from me,

35:31.172 --> 35:33.103
you know these
aren't possessions,

35:33.172 --> 35:37.103
and being able to take a
piece of wood that was gonna
be a shelf in my cabin and

35:37.172 --> 35:39.241
make skis out of it,

35:39.310 --> 35:43.172
and something that I can
transport myself all around
this beautiful landscape,

35:43.241 --> 35:45.103
that's a really-really
good feeling,

35:45.172 --> 35:46.965
and it's satisfying
knowing that I can make

35:47.034 --> 35:48.758
something from nothing.

35:51.068 --> 35:52.586
But they look awesome,
I think they look great.

35:52.655 --> 35:53.758
They got a lot of character.

35:53.827 --> 35:55.068
Oh hey.
What do you think?

35:55.137 --> 35:56.586
You think these look good?

35:56.655 --> 35:57.965
Huh?

35:58.034 --> 36:00.241
You just like the
hides on the bottom?

36:00.310 --> 36:03.448
Yeah, you like those
hides don't you?

36:03.517 --> 36:05.000
I think these look awesome.

36:05.068 --> 36:06.793
These are gonna
be a lot of fun.

36:06.862 --> 36:10.482
They're gonna get me around,
moving around faster in snow.

36:12.103 --> 36:14.793
ALEX: No matter what.
Nature's demand is clear.

36:14.862 --> 36:18.448
I gotta burn some
calories to get what
I want from this place.

36:18.517 --> 36:20.689
Uh, that's just the way it is.

36:26.862 --> 36:28.793
ALEX: Down as far as it goes.

36:28.862 --> 36:31.965
I was so tired after the last
day I was out here digging,

36:32.034 --> 36:34.103
I took an entire day and just
pretty much slept all day.

36:34.172 --> 36:35.413
I was beat.

36:35.482 --> 36:37.103
So, I'm just gonna
pick up where we left off,

36:37.172 --> 36:39.620
I think I've got
probably two more feet
of ice to dig through.

36:39.689 --> 36:42.275
It's getting harder
now because, uh,

36:42.344 --> 36:45.068
it's, as it gets further down,
I have to bend over more.

36:45.137 --> 36:46.551
But yeah, I think
it'll be worth it if I,

36:46.620 --> 36:48.793
'cause, um, I'm just
burning so much wood to uh,

36:48.862 --> 36:52.862
to melt ice, and, and also in
the future I wanna fish here.

36:52.931 --> 36:55.620
Uh, I mean this lake is gonna
be kinda my primary resource.

36:55.689 --> 36:59.517
It's, it's the big reason
I moved here, ya know?

36:59.586 --> 37:02.172
And I don't wanna just let
a little bit of ice stop me.

37:02.241 --> 37:04.517
I want to, uh, dig through it,
get to the water,

37:04.586 --> 37:07.551
be able to use that water so
that it's kinda like I do a bit

37:07.620 --> 37:10.413
of hard work, ya know,
yesterday, today, and then it

37:10.482 --> 37:13.275
should pay me back
big time, I expect, ya know?

37:13.344 --> 37:15.620
A man's gotta do what
a man's gotta do.

37:23.965 --> 37:27.137
Yeah, I, I thought getting water
here would be, be a no-brainer,

37:27.206 --> 37:28.551
it'd be pretty easy.

37:28.620 --> 37:31.551
We're digging through,
ya know, five feet of ice.

37:31.620 --> 37:33.241
That's pretty tough.

37:33.310 --> 37:35.206
So much chipped ice in there.

37:35.275 --> 37:38.137
I don't know if I'm
doing any damage or not.

37:45.344 --> 37:47.310
Yeah, I'm just digging
this hole, and digging
this hole and it's getting

37:47.379 --> 37:50.448
to a point where
I feel like I'm not
making progress anymore.

37:52.344 --> 37:54.206
It's pretty disheartening.

37:57.965 --> 38:00.448
So, it's getting pretty
personal ya know?

38:02.000 --> 38:04.862
And when it starts
feeling personal for me,

38:04.931 --> 38:07.689
then I feel at war.

38:07.758 --> 38:10.103
Man, how [bleep] deep is it?

38:10.172 --> 38:12.448
It just keeps
going and going.

38:14.586 --> 38:19.241
[ice chipping]

38:19.310 --> 38:20.655
Oh, there's water,
there's water.

38:20.724 --> 38:21.965
Oh my God.

38:24.275 --> 38:25.551
ALEX: Oh, there's water,
there's water.

38:25.620 --> 38:27.137
Oh my god.

38:29.103 --> 38:32.000
Here it comes, here it comes,
here it comes.

38:32.068 --> 38:34.620
Look at that beautiful water.

38:34.689 --> 38:38.689
I just dug through um,
I think technically it was
about five feet of ice.

38:38.758 --> 38:42.275
Uh, but my
muscles are telling me
it was about 200 feet.

38:42.344 --> 38:43.758
Man, that was a lot of digging.

38:43.827 --> 38:45.241
Finally broke through.

38:45.310 --> 38:46.758
I got water.

38:46.827 --> 38:48.448
I'm gonna get five gallons.

38:48.517 --> 38:50.482
I mean five gallons will
last me for, for weeks.

38:58.241 --> 39:02.172
Oh yeah, already the top the,
uh, it's starting to ice.

39:02.241 --> 39:04.896
I guess that water's
probably just right at

39:04.965 --> 39:08.310
like 31 degrees or whatever,

39:08.379 --> 39:10.103
31.9.

39:10.172 --> 39:13.551
Now that I know how
long it'll take to dig,

39:13.620 --> 39:15.310
what tools I'll need to
use you know what I mean,

39:15.379 --> 39:18.310
then I'll, it won't be
such a big deal 'cause
I just know you know

39:18.379 --> 39:21.000
okay it's gonna take a
couple hours, ya know?

39:21.068 --> 39:24.551
But again, I'm kinda using
a hodgepodge of tools here.

39:24.620 --> 39:26.689
If I get my corkscrew
thing working better,

39:26.758 --> 39:29.517
that'll probably be
the fastest way.

39:29.586 --> 39:32.413
Probably one of the big
things I've learned living
off grid so far is that the

39:32.482 --> 39:35.206
only thing I really have
to change is my mind.

39:35.275 --> 39:37.310
Society always wants
us to become something.

39:37.379 --> 39:39.689
But to me that's
all nonsense.

39:39.758 --> 39:44.000
Kinda my big mission is
to not become something
but just be what I am.

39:49.689 --> 39:53.551
I wanna do the things that
my instincts tell me to do,

39:53.620 --> 39:56.172
and I wanna just
know life fully.

39:56.241 --> 39:59.241
I wanna know all the
ups and downs of life.

39:59.310 --> 40:03.206
That way when it's
time for me to leave,
I can say I did it all.

40:07.862 --> 40:11.000
CHRIS: The way on the Cosna is
your always working forward.

40:11.068 --> 40:12.448
We like to push ourselves.

40:12.517 --> 40:14.344
We like to be challenged,

40:14.413 --> 40:16.931
but out here on the
Cosna we're always being
challenged with everything.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.758
You've got it. Push it up.

40:18.827 --> 40:21.310
Alright.
Roll that one into place.

40:21.379 --> 40:23.379
JESSI: Awesome.
CHRIS: Okay.

40:30.827 --> 40:33.586
This dang zipline is
super high up in the air.

40:33.655 --> 40:36.517
Gonna have to build some
kind of ladder on the
tree to get up there.

40:37.620 --> 40:39.379
Today we got the zipline up.

40:39.448 --> 40:42.137
It's all about
expanding territories,
expanding the hunting area,

40:42.206 --> 40:45.862
putting our foothold here
and learning and living
the lifestyle on the Cosna.

40:45.931 --> 40:50.551
JESSI: Alright, here Chris
goes across the biggest
zipline we've ever made.

40:50.620 --> 40:53.689
CHRIS: See you soon!

40:53.758 --> 41:00.068
JESSI: We did it, our
first 300-foot zipline
across the river twice.

41:00.137 --> 41:03.206
This is something
that we are gonna
get some much use out of.

41:05.793 --> 41:07.551
CHRIS: Awesome!

41:11.137 --> 41:13.206
JESSI: It definitely sags a lot.

41:13.275 --> 41:16.103
CHRIS: But it got me across
in, how long did it take?

41:16.172 --> 41:17.758
JESSI: I don't know,
fifteen seconds?

41:17.827 --> 41:19.793
CHRIS: Yeah, that's a lot
better than a 45 minute walk.

41:19.862 --> 41:21.689
JESSI: Yeah, you
only have to do that.

41:21.758 --> 41:23.241
CHRIS: Two steps
across the center?

41:23.310 --> 41:25.379
JESSI: Yeah.

41:25.448 --> 41:28.068
I'm so grateful that I can
have a partner out here that's
willing to do anything to make

41:28.137 --> 41:30.655
things better out here
like this is our home,

41:30.724 --> 41:33.241
this is where we wanna
spend all of our time.

41:35.517 --> 41:39.724
Everything that we build
out here for ourselves is
making this place better.

41:42.241 --> 41:44.965
KALEB: I think fire
is a magical thing.

41:45.034 --> 41:47.931
We take this cold, dead wood.

41:48.000 --> 41:51.931
We split it up,
a little bit of spark
and it warms your body.

41:52.000 --> 41:56.137
It warms the soul and
it's something that is
often taken for granted.

42:01.965 --> 42:04.413
BRITTANY: You're back!
KALEB: Yeah!

42:04.482 --> 42:05.931
ELOVIE: What's up?

42:06.000 --> 42:07.965
BRITTANY: So obviously
you guys were successful.

42:08.034 --> 42:10.517
GILBERT: Let go Elovie!
KALEB: Yup.

42:10.586 --> 42:12.413
We have the starts
of a new woodlot.

42:12.482 --> 42:14.103
BRITTANY: Oh good.

42:14.172 --> 42:15.793
KALEB: So, I'm pretty jazzed.

42:15.862 --> 42:17.793
BRITTANY: It's a
little bit closer than
the other woodlot too?

42:17.862 --> 42:21.034
KALEB: Just a wee bit.

42:21.103 --> 42:26.689
So, we got stuck going out
there and Ellie ran the
throttle to get us unstuck

42:26.758 --> 42:28.172
while I pulled on the skis.

42:28.241 --> 42:29.931
BRITTANY: Did you really?
ELOVIE: Yeah.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.931
BRITTANY: Was that so fun?
ELOVIE: Yeah.

42:32.000 --> 42:35.793
BRITTANY: Yeah! So, all
in all it was a success?

42:35.862 --> 42:37.689
KALEB: Oh yeah.
We had a good day together.

42:37.758 --> 42:40.310
BRITTANY: Good.

42:40.379 --> 42:42.448
KALEB: In the bush,
fire is important.

42:42.517 --> 42:44.137
Fire is everything,

42:44.206 --> 42:46.655
and it's not just my
house I'm keeping warm, right,

42:46.724 --> 42:49.482
it's a warm, safe,
loving environment for my

42:49.551 --> 42:54.172
kids and my wife,
so it's more than just a chore.

42:54.241 --> 42:57.137
It's almost a life calling
to make sure that the

42:57.206 --> 43:00.965
firewood is always
stocked up and ready to go.

43:01.034 --> 43:05.000
BRITTANY: Well,
we lost the kids.

43:06.379 --> 43:09.620
KALEB: Alright.
Let's go try this stuff out.

43:09.689 --> 43:11.344
BRITTANY:
Go find those children.

43:11.413 --> 43:14.379
KALEB: I imagine
we'll find them right in
front of the wood stove.

43:17.068 --> 43:20.620
JOHNNY: Maiden voyage
on the hunter skis, and I am
thoroughly impressed with them.

43:21.862 --> 43:23.241
They glide right up
on top of the snow.

43:23.310 --> 43:24.551
I don't sink too much.

43:24.620 --> 43:26.275
I got a ton of surface area,

43:26.344 --> 43:29.344
and it keeps me afloat
and I'm super excited
that I was able to

43:29.413 --> 43:33.517
add something to my arsenal
of transportation and
it's something that I made.

43:33.586 --> 43:34.931
So, it means a lot to me.

43:35.000 --> 43:36.655
These have character.
These have soul.

43:36.724 --> 43:39.379
They're a part of me.

43:39.448 --> 43:40.655
When people ask me,

43:40.724 --> 43:43.413
why do you choose
to be that secluded,

43:43.482 --> 43:45.172
why not live in the city?

43:45.241 --> 43:48.586
The city is a place of
limits and boundaries.

43:48.655 --> 43:50.931
And I'm a rebel at heart.

43:51.000 --> 43:54.068
You know I like to live wild.

43:54.137 --> 43:57.793
It's not normal
to be this alone,
to be this isolated.

43:57.862 --> 43:59.137
But if you look
at it differently,

43:59.206 --> 44:01.931
you can grow from it and
become a better person,

44:02.000 --> 44:03.793
and that's why
I choose the arctic.
