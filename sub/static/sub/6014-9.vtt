00:02.719 --> 00:05.678
I was watching women in the
department store trying on clothes.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.955
And I notice that they do it
differently from men.

00:08.240 --> 00:11.869
Women don't try on the clothes,
they get behind the clothes.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.870
They take a dress off the rack...

00:16.040 --> 00:19.271
...and they hold it up
against themself.

00:19.440 --> 00:21.112
They can tell something from this.

00:21.280 --> 00:24.511
They stick one leg way out.

00:24.680 --> 00:28.559
They need to know, "If someday I'm
one-legged at a 45-degree angle...

00:28.720 --> 00:30.517
...what am I gonna wear?"

00:31.240 --> 00:34.152
You never see a man do that,
see a guy take a suit off the rack...

00:34.320 --> 00:37.995
...put his head in the neck, go, "What
about this suit? I'll get it. Looks fine.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.879
Put some shoes by the bottom
of the pants. I want to make sure.

00:41.040 --> 00:43.952
Perfect. Now, what if I'm walking?
Move the shoes, move the shoes.

00:44.120 --> 00:46.759
Move the shoes."

00:53.840 --> 00:55.068
What are you doing?

00:55.240 --> 00:57.071
All right. All right.

00:57.240 --> 00:59.913
What's the matter with that?
What about that one?

01:00.080 --> 01:02.435
Robert Vaughn,
The Helsinki Formula?

01:04.400 --> 01:06.356
He was good in
Man From U.N. C.L.E.

01:06.520 --> 01:10.308
Guess whose birthday
is coming up soon.

01:10.480 --> 01:14.473
I know. I know. I'm having
my root canal the same week.

01:14.640 --> 01:19.111
I hope you got a good oral surgeon,
because that can be very serious.

01:21.600 --> 01:23.795
Hey, lookit. Naked people.

01:25.960 --> 01:28.235
No, I don't want to see
the naked people.

01:28.760 --> 01:30.910
Been a while?

01:32.520 --> 01:35.432
I have a vague recollection
of doing something with someone...

01:35.600 --> 01:37.670
...but it was a long, long time ago.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.473
I think my last time
was in Rochester.

01:41.840 --> 01:44.593
My hair was a lot shorter.

01:44.760 --> 01:46.910
I remember that it's a good thing.

01:49.040 --> 01:52.510
And someday, I hope to do it again.

02:01.320 --> 02:02.548
What?

02:02.720 --> 02:04.233
What?

02:04.720 --> 02:06.995
- What was that look?
- What look?

02:07.600 --> 02:08.919
The look you just gave me.

02:09.080 --> 02:10.717
- I gave a look?
- Yes.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.829
- What kind of a look?
- I know that look.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.355
- So, what was it?
- Why should I tell you?

02:16.520 --> 02:19.353
Well, you're the big look expert.

02:19.760 --> 02:21.193
I want to see how smart you are.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.436
Trust me. I know the look.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.388
- So?
- What?

02:31.560 --> 02:33.755
- What about the look?
- I don't know.

02:34.680 --> 02:37.353
- You got something on your mind?
- No.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.909
Things pop into your head.

02:40.240 --> 02:41.673
You?

02:41.840 --> 02:43.751
Things occur to me
from time to time.

02:43.920 --> 02:45.751
Yeah. Me too.

02:49.160 --> 02:53.199
Well, you can't expect to just
forget the past completely.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.952
Well, no, of course not.

02:55.440 --> 02:57.510
I mean, it's something we did.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.716
Probably about...

02:59.880 --> 03:01.233
...what, 25 times.

03:01.720 --> 03:03.631
Thirty-seven.

03:06.640 --> 03:10.110
Yeah, we pretty much know
what we're doing in there.

03:11.920 --> 03:14.912
- We know the terrain.
- No big surprises.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.718
Nope.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.834
- What do you think?
- I don't know. What do you think?

03:25.720 --> 03:27.517
Well, it's something to consider.

03:27.760 --> 03:30.718
- Yeah.
- I mean, let's say...

03:31.200 --> 03:32.394
...what if...

03:32.560 --> 03:34.357
...we did?
- What if?

03:34.520 --> 03:36.875
Is that, like, the end of the world
or something?

03:37.040 --> 03:39.600
- Certainly not.
- Why shouldn't we be able to do that...

03:39.760 --> 03:42.228
...once in a while if we want to?
- I know.

03:42.400 --> 03:44.356
I mean, really, what is the big deal?

03:44.520 --> 03:45.953
We go in there...

03:46.120 --> 03:49.510
...we're in there for a while,
then we come back out here.

03:49.840 --> 03:51.239
That's not complicated.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.231
It's almost stupid if we didn't.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.278
- It's moronic.
- Absurd.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.033
Course...

04:01.320 --> 04:05.154
...I guess maybe some little
problems could arise.

04:05.320 --> 04:06.514
There are always a few.

04:06.680 --> 04:08.671
I mean, if anything happened...

04:08.840 --> 04:12.879
...and we couldn't be friends the way
we are now, that would really be bad.

04:13.040 --> 04:17.238
- Devastating.
- Because this is very good.

04:19.399 --> 04:21.231
And that would be good.

04:21.399 --> 04:23.356
That would be good too.

04:24.240 --> 04:26.959
The idea is to combine the this...

04:27.120 --> 04:28.951
...and the that.

04:29.360 --> 04:31.635
But this cannot be disturbed.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.553
Yeah, we just want to take this...

04:34.720 --> 04:37.518
...and add that.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.988
But of course, we'd have
to figure out a way...

04:43.160 --> 04:46.038
...to avoid the things that
cause the little problems.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.919
Maybe some rules or something.

04:49.240 --> 04:50.559
For example:

04:52.200 --> 04:55.351
Now I call you whenever
I'm inclined, and vice versa.

04:55.520 --> 04:58.751
But if we did that, we might feel...

04:58.920 --> 05:01.036
...a certain obligation to call.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.270
Well, why should that be?

05:03.720 --> 05:05.711
I have an idea.

05:05.880 --> 05:09.668
No calls the day after that.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.239
Beautiful.

05:11.440 --> 05:12.634
Let's make it a rule.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.518
All right, sir.

05:17.040 --> 05:19.838
- Now, here's another little rule.
- Yeah.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.672
When we see each other now...

05:21.840 --> 05:23.751
...we retire to our separate quarters.

05:23.920 --> 05:26.957
But sometimes when people
get involved with that...

05:27.120 --> 05:29.350
...they feel pressure...

05:29.520 --> 05:31.795
...to sleep over.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.078
When that...

05:34.240 --> 05:35.719
...is not really sleep.

05:38.160 --> 05:42.153
Sleep is separate from that,
and I don't see...

05:42.320 --> 05:47.348
...why sleep got all tied up
and connected...

05:47.920 --> 05:49.353
...with that.

05:49.760 --> 05:55.198
Okay, okay, rule number two:
Spending the night is optional.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.589
Well, now we're getting somewhere.

06:02.400 --> 06:04.118
Good.

06:04.720 --> 06:07.951
- What about the kiss good night?
- Tough one.

06:08.480 --> 06:10.198
Your call.

06:10.800 --> 06:11.994
It's bourgeois.

06:12.160 --> 06:13.673
Fine.

06:15.280 --> 06:16.554
Well.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.593
Well.

06:24.880 --> 06:26.154
You ready?

06:28.080 --> 06:29.513
Ready.

06:36.840 --> 06:38.239
So you think you can handle this?

06:38.400 --> 06:40.311
Definitely.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.273
- Hey.
- Hey.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.350
- Got the paper?
- Not yet.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.033
- No paper.
- I haven't been out yet.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.749
Well, what's taking you so long?

07:04.480 --> 07:05.913
Oh, yeah.

07:09.720 --> 07:11.278
What's the deal with Aquaman?

07:12.200 --> 07:15.112
Could he go on the land,
or was he just restricted to water?

07:15.760 --> 07:17.796
No, I think I saw him on land
a couple times.

07:20.120 --> 07:22.475
So how's the job situation going?

07:22.640 --> 07:23.834
Still looking.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.468
Pretty bad out there.
What about you?

07:26.640 --> 07:28.756
Nothing much.
I slept with Elaine last night.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.713
Oxygen. I need some oxygen.

07:35.880 --> 07:38.030
- This is major.
- I thought you'd like that.

07:38.200 --> 07:39.838
Oh, this is huge!

07:40.000 --> 07:43.276
- I know.
- All right, okay. Let's go. Details.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.953
No, I can't give details.

07:45.320 --> 07:47.276
- You what?
- I can't give details.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.353
No details?

07:50.040 --> 07:51.758
I'm not in the mood.

07:53.640 --> 07:55.676
You ask me here to have lunch...

07:55.840 --> 07:57.671
...tell me you slept with Elaine...

07:57.840 --> 08:00.832
...and then say you're not
in the mood for details.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.991
Now, you listen to me.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.233
I want details,
and I want them right now.

08:06.400 --> 08:08.709
I don't have a job,
I have no place to go.

08:08.880 --> 08:12.156
You're not in the mood?
Well, you get in the mood!

08:13.920 --> 08:16.309
All right. Okay.

08:16.480 --> 08:18.152
We were in my apartment,
watching TV.

08:18.320 --> 08:19.878
- Where you sitting?
- On the couch.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.359
- Next to each other?
- Separate.

08:21.520 --> 08:22.919
- Time?
- Around 11.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.877
Okay, go ahead.

08:25.800 --> 08:28.189
So she's flipping around the TV...

08:28.360 --> 08:30.794
...and she gets to the naked station.

08:31.120 --> 08:34.590
See, that's why I don't have cable,
because of that naked station.

08:34.760 --> 08:37.832
If I had that in my house,
I would never turn it off.

08:38.039 --> 08:39.792
I wouldn't sleep. I wouldn't eat.

08:39.960 --> 08:41.871
Eventually, firemen would
break through the door.

08:42.039 --> 08:45.794
They'd find me in my pyjamas
with drool coming down my face.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.030
All right, so you're watching
the naked station.

08:48.640 --> 08:50.153
And then...

08:50.320 --> 08:53.835
...somehow we started talking about,
"What if we had sex?"

08:55.320 --> 08:57.470
Boy, these are really bad details.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.310
It pains me to say this, but I may
be getting too mature for details.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.358
I hate to hear this.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.428
Any kind of growth
really irritates me.

09:07.040 --> 09:10.635
- I'll tell you, it was really passionate.
- Better than before?

09:10.800 --> 09:13.758
She must have taken some kind
of seminar or something.

09:15.160 --> 09:18.232
This is all too much.
So, what are you feeling?

09:18.400 --> 09:20.550
What's going on?
Are you, like, a couple again now?

09:20.720 --> 09:23.109
- Not exactly.
- "Not exactly." What does that mean?

09:23.920 --> 09:27.310
Well, we've tried
to arrange a situation...

09:27.480 --> 09:29.948
...where we'll be able
to do this once in a while...

09:30.120 --> 09:31.348
...and still be friends.

09:39.440 --> 09:40.793
What?

09:42.400 --> 09:44.391
Where are you living?

09:44.720 --> 09:47.359
Are you here?
Are you on this planet?

09:47.520 --> 09:50.193
It's impossible. It can't be done.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.591
Thousands of years, people have tried
to have their cake and eat it too.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.036
So all of a sudden, the two of you
are gonna come along and do it.

09:57.360 --> 09:59.112
Where do you get the ego?

10:00.760 --> 10:02.796
No one can do it. It can't be done.

10:02.960 --> 10:05.030
I think we've worked out a system.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.953
You know what you're like?
You're like a pathetic gambler.

10:08.120 --> 10:10.429
One of these losers in Las Vegas
who keeps thinking...

10:10.600 --> 10:12.830
...he's gonna come up with
a way to win at blackjack.

10:13.000 --> 10:17.551
No, this is very advanced.
We've designed a set of rules.

10:17.720 --> 10:22.077
That we can maintain the friendship
by avoiding all the relationship pitfalls.

10:22.240 --> 10:24.037
All right, all right. Tell me the rules.

10:24.200 --> 10:25.679
Okay.

10:26.160 --> 10:28.879
No calls the next day.

10:30.800 --> 10:34.315
So you have the sex,
next day, you don't have to call.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.632
That's pretty good.

10:39.120 --> 10:41.156
- Go ahead.
- You ready for the second one?

10:41.320 --> 10:43.834
I have to tell you,
I'm very impressed with the first one.

10:45.200 --> 10:47.430
Spending the night:

10:47.760 --> 10:48.954
Optional.

10:49.400 --> 10:52.358
No. No. You see? You got greedy.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.631
No, that's the rule. It's optional.

10:54.800 --> 10:57.189
I know less about women...

10:58.200 --> 10:59.758
...than anyone in the world.

10:59.920 --> 11:04.550
But the one thing I do know is, they're
not happy if you don't spend the night.

11:04.720 --> 11:08.872
It could be a hot, sweaty room
with no air conditioning...

11:09.040 --> 11:12.191
...and all they have is
a little Army cot this wide.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.396
You're not going anywhere.

11:14.920 --> 11:17.957
- I think you're wrong.
- I hope I am.

11:20.720 --> 11:22.631
- Is this yours or the roommate's?
- Roommate's.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.678
- Would she mind?
- She keeps track of everything.

11:25.840 --> 11:28.400
Well, that's too bad,
because I'm taking it.

11:28.560 --> 11:30.073
Oh, thanks.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.514
Well...

11:32.800 --> 11:34.518
...guess I'll get going.

11:36.080 --> 11:38.992
I got that root canal tomorrow morning.
It'll be easy if I go home.

11:39.160 --> 11:40.354
Fine. Go ahead.

11:40.520 --> 11:42.556
I don't understand.
Is there a problem?

11:44.680 --> 11:46.636
I'm getting the impression
there's a problem.

11:48.160 --> 11:50.310
- Just go.
- I'm having surgery tomorrow.

11:50.480 --> 11:53.916
- Surgery! You're going to the dentist!
- You said it could be very serious.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.316
Okay. So fine, go.

11:56.480 --> 11:58.072
What happened to the rules?
Remember?

11:58.240 --> 11:59.753
Sleeping over was optional.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.639
- It's my house, it's my option!
- It has nothing to do with that!

12:02.800 --> 12:05.678
- Of course it does.
- Hi.

12:05.840 --> 12:06.989
- Hi.
- HI.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.991
- Hi, Jerry.
- Hi.

12:09.320 --> 12:10.958
Such a great improv class tonight.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.997
Really?

12:13.160 --> 12:14.513
I had this improv...

12:15.200 --> 12:16.599
...where I pretended...

12:16.760 --> 12:19.433
...I was working in one of those
booths in an amusement park...

12:19.600 --> 12:22.592
...where you shoot water in the clown's
mouth and blow up the balloon.

12:23.920 --> 12:27.196
Tina, could you excuse us
for just one second?

12:28.560 --> 12:29.754
Yeah.

12:29.920 --> 12:31.433
I'll excuse you.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.430
- What are you doing?
- I can't go if you're mad.

12:39.880 --> 12:41.711
I'm not mad.

12:41.880 --> 12:43.108
You seem a little mad.

12:43.280 --> 12:46.431
No, Jerry, I'm fine. Really, it's okay.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.318
So you're okay with everything?

12:48.920 --> 12:50.319
Definitely.

12:50.480 --> 12:52.038
Are you?

12:52.200 --> 12:53.679
Definitely.

12:55.600 --> 12:56.953
Well...

12:57.520 --> 12:59.078
...good night.
- Good ni...

12:59.240 --> 13:00.753
- What are you doing?
- What?

13:01.360 --> 13:02.952
The rules.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.830
Hey, who took my cake?

13:12.680 --> 13:14.716
What about jewellery?
That's a nice birthday gift.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.314
Oh, no, I have to be
very careful here.

13:17.480 --> 13:21.393
I don't want to send the wrong
message. Not after the other night.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.232
- Maybe I'll get her some jewellery.
- No.

13:23.400 --> 13:25.311
You can't get her anything
better than me.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.630
Whatever I spend,
you have to spend half.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.558
What am I supposed to get,
a bazooka?

13:29.720 --> 13:33.076
You don't understand.
I'm in a very delicate position.

13:33.240 --> 13:36.949
Whatever I give her, she'll be bringing
in experts from all over the country...

13:37.120 --> 13:38.997
...to interpret the meaning behind it.

13:41.320 --> 13:44.073
What does she need? Maybe there's
something that she needs.

13:44.720 --> 13:47.553
I think I heard her say something
about a bench.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.313
A bench?

13:50.480 --> 13:52.232
- What kind of a bench?
- I don't know.

13:52.400 --> 13:55.517
- She mentioned a bench.
- What, like at a bus stop?

13:57.040 --> 13:59.429
- I don't know.
- Like a park bench?

13:59.600 --> 14:00.874
I have no idea.

14:01.040 --> 14:04.271
- Who puts a bench in the house?
- Forget the bench!

14:05.520 --> 14:08.080
I got it. You want something nice?
What about a music box?

14:08.400 --> 14:11.278
No, too relationship-y.

14:11.440 --> 14:15.194
I mean, she opens it up, she hears
that "Lara's Theme," I'm dead.

14:18.040 --> 14:20.554
Okay, what about a nice frame...

14:20.720 --> 14:22.995
...with a picture of another guy in it?

14:23.360 --> 14:26.158
The frame says, "I care for you,
but if you want to get serious...

14:26.320 --> 14:28.675
...perhaps you'd be interested
in someone like this."

14:29.880 --> 14:31.074
Nice-looking fellow.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.549
- What about candleholders?
- Too romantic.

14:33.720 --> 14:36.280
- Lingerie?
- Too sexual.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.271
- Waffle maker?
- Too domestic.

14:39.760 --> 14:41.591
Bust of Nelson Rockefeller?

14:42.440 --> 14:44.032
Too gubernatorial.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.552
Let's work on the card.

14:48.840 --> 14:50.637
I had to buy a gift for someone.

14:50.800 --> 14:53.030
The hardest part is that card.
The card is a killer.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.156
I never know what it's
supposed to say.

14:55.320 --> 14:58.630
And it's getting so tough, because
the relationships are so complicated...

14:58.800 --> 15:02.475
...greeting-card companies now
put out cards that are blank...

15:02.640 --> 15:04.232
...on the inside. Nothing.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.630
No message.
It's like the card company says:

15:06.800 --> 15:08.631
"We give up.
You think of something."

15:08.800 --> 15:12.634
You know? "For 75 cents,
I don't want to get involved."

15:14.600 --> 15:16.875
- Maybe you won't like it.
- How could I not like it?

15:17.040 --> 15:19.429
- Of course I'll like it.
- You could not like it.

15:19.600 --> 15:22.478
Just the fact that you remembered
means everything.

15:22.640 --> 15:23.914
Of course I remembered.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.674
You reminded me every day
for two months.

15:27.480 --> 15:29.118
Oh, the card.

15:44.320 --> 15:46.390
- Cash?
- What do you think?

15:48.520 --> 15:49.794
You got me cash?

15:50.120 --> 15:53.351
This way, I figure you could go out
and get yourself whatever you want.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.919
No good?

15:55.080 --> 15:56.513
Who are you, my uncle?

15:56.680 --> 16:00.116
Hey. Come on, it's $182 there. I don't
think that's anything to sneeze at.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.631
Let me see the card.

16:12.080 --> 16:16.915
"To a wonderful girl, a great pal...

16:17.080 --> 16:19.150
...and more."

16:21.760 --> 16:22.988
Hey.

16:23.640 --> 16:27.758
Elaine, I'm glad you're here. Stay right
here. I'm gonna be right back. Stay.

16:29.240 --> 16:31.993
"Pal"? You think I'm your pal?

16:32.160 --> 16:34.151
I said, "and more."

16:38.040 --> 16:39.632
I am not your pal.

16:39.800 --> 16:43.031
What's wrong with pal?
Why is everybody so down on pal?

16:43.200 --> 16:46.749
- Hey.
- Oh, what is this?

16:46.920 --> 16:49.593
- You got me something?
- Yeah. Yeah, open it.

16:50.240 --> 16:52.231
Kramer!

16:53.200 --> 16:56.272
The bench! You got me
the bench that I wanted!

17:01.680 --> 17:03.352
- That's pretty good, huh?
- Great.

17:03.520 --> 17:06.239
You remember when she mentioned it?
I made a mental note of it.

17:06.720 --> 17:08.311
Well, goody for you.

17:08.480 --> 17:10.835
Yeah. See, I'm very sensitive
about that.

17:11.000 --> 17:14.913
I mean, someone's birthday comes up,
I keep my ears open.

17:15.280 --> 17:16.713
So, what did you get her?

17:18.720 --> 17:20.073
182 bucks.

17:21.240 --> 17:23.037
Cash?

17:23.520 --> 17:26.114
You've gotta be kidding.
What kind of gift is that?

17:26.280 --> 17:29.078
That's like something
her uncle would give her.

17:30.880 --> 17:34.793
"Think where man's glory
most begins and ends...

17:34.960 --> 17:39.033
...and say my glory
was I had such a friend."

17:40.160 --> 17:41.991
Yeats.

17:43.120 --> 17:45.076
Oh, Kramer.

17:49.200 --> 17:51.839
Could you excuse us, please?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.228
What?

17:53.400 --> 17:54.674
We're talking.

17:54.840 --> 17:57.752
Oh, the relationship.

18:06.120 --> 18:08.873
You know, we never had
one fight before this deal.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.189
- I know.
- Never.

18:10.360 --> 18:12.749
- Ever.
- We got along beautifully.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.558
- Like clams.
- It was wonderful.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.153
A pleasure.

18:16.480 --> 18:20.553
So I think we should forget the whole
deal and go back to being friends.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.273
I can't do it.

18:26.000 --> 18:27.513
You what?

18:28.840 --> 18:30.751
I can't do that.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.070
You mean, it's:

18:35.600 --> 18:37.511
No this?

18:38.600 --> 18:40.556
No that.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.158
No this or that.

18:45.320 --> 18:46.753
Oh, boy.

18:49.680 --> 18:51.352
What do you want?

18:51.520 --> 18:53.750
This, that and the other.

18:54.880 --> 18:56.677
Oh, sure. Of course. You're entitled.

18:56.840 --> 18:59.354
Who doesn't want this,
that and the other?

18:59.840 --> 19:01.717
You.

19:02.320 --> 19:03.753
Well...

19:06.960 --> 19:08.154
Those birthdays.

19:08.320 --> 19:11.153
I told you, they're relationship killers.

19:11.320 --> 19:15.632
If a relationship's having any problems
whatsoever, a birthday brings it out.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.711
I never should have
made up those rules.

19:18.640 --> 19:21.438
What is it about sex that just
disrupts everything?

19:21.600 --> 19:23.318
Is it the touching? Is it the nudity?

19:24.080 --> 19:25.877
It can't be the nudity.

19:26.040 --> 19:28.713
I never got into these terrible fights
and misunderstandings...

19:28.880 --> 19:30.996
...when I was changing
before gym class.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.831
This means I can't see her
anymore either.

19:35.000 --> 19:38.629
- Why?
- It's breakup by association.

19:40.880 --> 19:43.997
Besides, she's mad at me anyway
because of my birthday present.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.312
Why? What did you
wind up giving her?

19:47.040 --> 19:49.031
Ninety-one dollars.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.712
Sorry about that.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.076
So, what are you gonna do?

19:58.000 --> 20:01.629
If I call her, there's no joking around
anymore. This is pretty much it.

20:02.480 --> 20:03.993
So maybe this should be it.

20:04.560 --> 20:07.313
- Could be it.
- She seems like an it.

20:07.480 --> 20:09.675
She's as it as you get.

20:09.880 --> 20:13.475
Imagine bumping into her on the street
in five years with a husband.

20:13.640 --> 20:16.518
And she tells me that he's a sculptor.
They live in Vermont.

20:17.040 --> 20:18.678
We'd have to kill him.

20:19.360 --> 20:21.396
We'd get caught. I'd get the chair.

20:21.960 --> 20:24.394
I'd go to prison as your accomplice.

20:24.960 --> 20:27.474
Have to wear that really
heavy denim.

20:28.160 --> 20:32.836
The cafeteria, with the guy who slops
the mashed potatoes onto your plate.

20:33.680 --> 20:35.989
Go to the bathroom in front
of hundreds of people.

20:36.160 --> 20:37.593
Plus...

20:37.760 --> 20:38.954
...you know what else.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.037
You better call her.

20:44.920 --> 20:45.909
- Hey.
- Hey.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.752
- You got the paper yet?
- Yeah.

20:47.920 --> 20:49.751
Well, where is it?

20:51.640 --> 20:53.551
- Hey, you done with that?
- No.

20:53.720 --> 20:56.029
Well, you're not reading it now.

20:56.560 --> 20:58.596
All right, you can take it,
but I want it back.

20:58.760 --> 20:59.988
Yeah, yeah.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.198
So...

21:04.360 --> 21:06.396
...what are you guys
gonna do today?

21:07.000 --> 21:08.592
This and...

21:09.560 --> 21:10.754
...that.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.196
And the other.

21:14.480 --> 21:18.234
Boy, I really liked the two of you much
better when you weren't a couple.

21:28.840 --> 21:32.515
Why is commitment such
a big problem for a man?

21:32.680 --> 21:34.318
I think that for some reason...

21:34.480 --> 21:38.029
...when a man is driving down
that freeway of life...

21:38.200 --> 21:40.760
...the woman he's involved with
is like an exit.

21:40.920 --> 21:43.639
But he doesn't want to get out.
He wants to keep driving.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.872
The woman is like, "Look.
Gas, food, lodging. That's our exit.

21:47.040 --> 21:48.871
That's everything we need
to be happy.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.952
Get out, here, now!"

21:52.800 --> 21:54.711
But the man focuses
on the sign underneath...

21:54.880 --> 21:57.952
...that says, "Next exit, 27 miles."
And he thinks, "I can make it."
