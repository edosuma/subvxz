WEBVTT

00:01.360 --> 00:03.590
Previously on Elementary...
You ruined my life.
Gun!

00:05.600 --> 00:08.694
WOMAN:
A blood clot got wedged in his
right subclavian artery,

00:08.740 --> 00:10.628
obstructed the blood flow
to his arm for about 30 minutes.

00:10.670 --> 00:13.138
He may never regain
full use of the limb.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.204
WATSON:
This is about your guilt.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.730
You're not directly responsible
for what happened.

00:15.780 --> 00:17.270
But this time your fondness

00:17.310 --> 00:18.777
for blowing past
bureaucratic guideposts

00:18.810 --> 00:21.142
got a man you respect shot.

00:21.180 --> 00:22.681
You may very well
have saved my life.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.278
I'd rather not
see you around here.

00:35.660 --> 00:38.026
Look at you, southpaw.

00:38.570 --> 00:41.130
Well, life has changed, right?

00:41.170 --> 00:43.559
At least nowadays most of
the paperwork's on the computer.

00:43.610 --> 00:45.828
Well, I made you some
ready-to-nuke dinners.

00:45.870 --> 00:47.599
Nothing fancy.

00:47.640 --> 00:48.607
Baked ziti's about the extent

00:48.640 --> 00:49.777
of my culinary skills.

00:49.810 --> 00:51.243
Thanks.

00:51.280 --> 00:52.838
That's really nice of you.

00:52.880 --> 00:55.269
What did the doctor
say about your hand?

00:55.320 --> 00:57.140
Uh, he doesn't know.

00:57.190 --> 00:58.589
It's only been a few weeks.

00:58.620 --> 00:59.848
Physical therapy's helping,

00:59.890 --> 01:01.289
but they still can't tell me

01:01.320 --> 01:03.151
if the damage is permanent.

01:03.190 --> 01:04.782
Well, you're back at
work, that's good.

01:04.830 --> 01:06.195
Yeah.

01:06.230 --> 01:10.189
If you call, uh,
pushing papers around work.

01:10.230 --> 01:12.164
Hey, you know they say
that learning to write

01:12.200 --> 01:13.861
with your other hand is
good for the brain.

01:13.900 --> 01:16.130
Builds new pathways,
keeps you young.

01:16.170 --> 01:17.808
Great.

01:17.840 --> 01:19.637
So if this, uh, trauma
sticks around forever,

01:19.680 --> 01:21.875
I'll have a really
long time to enjoy it.

01:21.910 --> 01:25.243
Marcus, do you think you...

01:25.280 --> 01:26.577
need to talk to someone?

01:26.620 --> 01:28.713
No, honestly, I think
what I really need

01:28.750 --> 01:30.149
is to talk less.

01:33.790 --> 01:35.417
Thanks again for the food.

01:35.460 --> 01:36.449
Okay?

01:39.700 --> 01:40.894
All right, I'll see you later.

01:40.930 --> 01:43.125
Mm-hmm.

01:53.240 --> 01:55.629
Don't trip the proximity sensor.

02:08.320 --> 02:10.151
Actually, would you mind
stepping back a couple of paces?

02:10.190 --> 02:11.657
I'm feeling
a little bit crowded.

02:18.370 --> 02:20.235
(alarm blaring)

02:22.270 --> 02:22.929
Hey!
(alarm stops)

02:22.970 --> 02:24.528
Are you crazy?

02:24.570 --> 02:26.470
That's a half-million
dollar car.
Surely when

02:26.510 --> 02:29.240
your employers hired you
to test the security measures

02:29.280 --> 02:30.679
they knew it would result in
a little bit of wear and tear.

02:30.710 --> 02:31.870
Wouldn't explain
a foot in the door.

02:31.910 --> 02:33.172
Well, they should
be pleased.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.539
Their system's
obviously impregnable.

02:34.580 --> 02:36.184
Actually,
it's totally pregnable.

02:36.220 --> 02:37.244
I beat it ten times today.

02:41.220 --> 02:43.222
You got a lot on your mind.

02:43.260 --> 02:46.195
All the stuff that happened
with your buddy, the detective.

02:46.230 --> 02:49.529
Is utterly irrelevant
to breaking into a car.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.923
Obviously.

02:56.370 --> 02:57.667
In terms of my actions
on the case

02:57.710 --> 02:59.302
which resulted
in Detective Bell's injury,

02:59.340 --> 03:01.706
I was completely in the right.

03:01.740 --> 03:03.970
I've reviewed
every deCISIon I made.

03:04.010 --> 03:05.807
Every inflection point
in the investigation.

03:05.850 --> 03:09.286
And it is indisputable from any
rational cost benefit analysis

03:09.320 --> 03:11.345
that I did everything correctly.

03:12.660 --> 03:15.311
So, why can I not move on?

03:15.360 --> 03:16.952
Why does the matter persist
in buzzing away

03:16.990 --> 03:19.322
at my most precious commodity,

03:19.360 --> 03:21.328
my concentration?

03:21.360 --> 03:22.588
Maybe we should head
for a meeting.

03:25.670 --> 03:27.797
I came here tonight,
not as your sponsee,

03:27.840 --> 03:29.501
but as a friend and colleague

03:29.540 --> 03:32.577
whose vocation creates
certain overlapping Interests.

03:32.610 --> 03:35.636
Besides I think this is
what I need tonight.

03:37.310 --> 03:39.312
Fine.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.341
But tomorrow,
we're hitting a meeting.

03:50.030 --> 03:51.657
(tool clattering)

03:51.690 --> 03:53.749
Allegations continue to mount
that Donald Hauser,

03:53.800 --> 03:56.667
trusted money manager
to New York's elite,

03:56.700 --> 04:00.488
may, in fact, have been running
a decades-long pyramid scheme.

04:00.540 --> 04:03.008
Sources inside the SEC confirm

04:03.040 --> 04:05.531
that they're now scrutinizing
Hauser's private hedge fund,

04:05.570 --> 04:08.403
which seemed to yield
consistent annual returns

04:08.440 --> 04:10.374
of 12% or more.

04:10.410 --> 04:11.570
Thanks to the work

04:11.610 --> 04:13.271
of independent journalist
Rosalie Nuez,

04:13.320 --> 04:15.049
who first sounded the alarm,

04:15.080 --> 04:17.947
we may now discover
those returns were all lies.

04:17.990 --> 04:20.379
If so, Hauser will be looking
at criminal charges

04:20.420 --> 04:23.526
that could put him behind bars
for the rest of his life,

04:23.560 --> 04:26.358
while hundreds of his investors
will absorb the news

04:26.400 --> 04:28.356
that their life savings
have vanished.

04:28.400 --> 04:31.062
Neither Haus_er_
nor anyone at hIS firm

04:31.100 --> 04:33.364
responded in time to comment.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.858
Stocks were relatively flat
today, as analysts...

04:36.910 --> 04:40.630
(broadcast continues
indistinctly)

04:40.680 --> 04:42.648
(gunshot)
(yelling)

04:42.680 --> 04:44.875
Ow! God! Ow!

04:44.910 --> 04:47.310
(crying)

04:48.750 --> 04:51.480
(gasping)

04:53.620 --> 04:55.485
(yelling)

04:55.520 --> 04:58.353
(crying)

04:58.390 --> 05:00.494
I was about to kill myself.

05:00.530 --> 05:02.498
(sobbing):
Please.

05:02.530 --> 05:04.020
What's done is done.

05:04.070 --> 05:08.097
I know. That's what
I want to talk about.

05:08.140 --> 05:10.404
MAN (on TV): Good morning
to you, as well...

05:10.440 --> 05:12.431
Donald, it's me.

05:12.480 --> 05:14.675
(TV broadcast continues
indistinctly)

05:15.840 --> 05:18.400
(screams)

05:57.520 --> 06:00.080
Well, someone had some
anger to work out.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.656
Steal a few hundred
million dollars

06:01.690 --> 06:03.089
of other people's money,

06:03.130 --> 06:05.883
somebody's bound
to get ticked off.

06:05.930 --> 06:07.420
WATSON:
So, who found him?

06:07.460 --> 06:08.688
Personal chef. She came in,

06:08.730 --> 06:11.563
said the alarm system was off,
and the TV was on.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.465
She's here in the kitchen.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.730
Miss, uh, Butler?

06:18.740 --> 06:22.608
Miss Butler,
this is Joan Watson.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.744
Sorry to meet
under these circumstances.

06:27.780 --> 06:30.578
Thank you.

06:30.620 --> 06:32.656
Miss Watson and her partner
there, Mr. Holmes,

06:32.690 --> 06:34.988
consult for
the department.

06:35.020 --> 06:36.556
So, you are
a personal chef?

06:36.590 --> 06:39.923
_Mr. Hauser was_ a
client for a long time.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.598
I prepared meals
for him at my house

06:41.630 --> 06:44.724
and-and brought them here
a few times a week.

06:44.770 --> 06:45.998
GREGSON:
You any idea

06:46.030 --> 06:47.998
who might want
to hurt Mr. Hauser?

06:48.040 --> 06:51.032
Oh, with what's been going on
in the press, plenty of people.

06:51.070 --> 06:53.573
What-What's he doing?

06:53.610 --> 06:55.999
(garbled radio transmission)

06:57.880 --> 07:00.019
He, uh, has a process.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.870
Captain?

07:03.520 --> 07:06.489
Would you excuse me?

07:06.520 --> 07:10.081
I take it the victim's gun
was found here?
Yeah, by the first

07:10.130 --> 07:12.121
uniforms on the scene.
Registered to Hauser.

07:12.160 --> 07:13.593
However, different caliber

07:13.630 --> 07:15.518
than the casings we
found on the floor.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.993
Figured Hauser tried
to defend himself.

07:17.030 --> 07:19.464
Never got a shot off.

07:19.500 --> 07:21.889
I can assure you
Mr. Hauser did not pull his gun

07:21.940 --> 07:23.168
in self-defense. At least,

07:23.210 --> 07:24.905
not at first.
Rather,

07:24.940 --> 07:26.703
he was about to commit suicide

07:26.740 --> 07:29.231
when he was very rudely
interrupted.

07:29.280 --> 07:32.511
The handgun was stored here
in this drawer.

07:32.550 --> 07:35.018
Whoever removed it bothered
to close the drawer

07:35.050 --> 07:36.779
when they were done.

07:36.820 --> 07:38.640
This is a very unlikely action
on anyone's part

07:38.690 --> 07:40.749
during the middle
of a heated home invasion.

07:40.790 --> 07:44.556
No. Mr. Hauser's gun was out
before the killer entered.

07:45.660 --> 07:47.548
The whiskey-- Glen Lochaber,

07:47.600 --> 07:50.489
1926, single cask,
aged for 55 years.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.634
Yum. Only 100 bottles
ever produced.

07:52.670 --> 07:55.833
Probably set Mr. Hauser back
about $10,000.

07:59.070 --> 08:00.731
judging by the ring of dust

08:00.780 --> 08:02.645
where it usually sat
on his bar,

08:02.680 --> 08:05.843
he kept it for only
the very rarest of occasions.

08:05.880 --> 08:07.211
Miss Butler

08:07.250 --> 08:08.740
said the television was on

08:08.780 --> 08:10.179
when she entered.

08:10.220 --> 08:12.688
We all know what story dominated
the news last night.

08:12.720 --> 08:15.780
Hauser himself_
was Sitting, watching

08:15.820 --> 08:18.050
as he filled his glass
to the very brim.

08:18.090 --> 08:19.955
No longer any point
in saving it.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.991
Lastly...

08:24.130 --> 08:27.759
...gun oil on the roof
of his mouth.

08:27.800 --> 08:29.700
The irony of ironies.

08:29.740 --> 08:31.765
Our killer arrived just in time

08:31.810 --> 08:34.574
to stop Mr. Hauser
from shooting himself.

08:34.610 --> 08:38.944
So, what? Killer just wanted to
squeeze in some torture first?

08:38.980 --> 08:41.813
Probably not as satisfying as
getting his or her money back,

08:41.850 --> 08:45.684
but I suppose
you take what you can get.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.608
Oh. According to this article,

08:47.660 --> 08:50.128
there could be over a thousand
people that were affected

08:50.160 --> 08:51.957
by Donald Hauser's
pyramid scheme.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.720
I'd say our work is cut out
for us, wouldn't you?

08:54.760 --> 08:57.820
Actually, I've got a rather good
idea of where I'd like to start.

08:57.870 --> 09:01.294
The chef,
Chloe Butler.
Why?

09:01.340 --> 09:02.762
You not see
how nervous she was

09:02.810 --> 09:04.004
when we were interviewing her?

09:04.040 --> 09:05.166
Her haptics
were practically screaming

09:05.210 --> 09:06.199
that she was hiding something.

09:06.240 --> 09:07.832
Well, she just found

09:07.880 --> 09:09.131
the mutilated corpse
of her boss.

09:09.180 --> 09:11.774
Her alibi left something
to be desired, as well, no?

09:11.810 --> 09:13.346
Well, just because she
said she was home alone

09:13.380 --> 09:15.678
during the time of the murder
doesn't mean she did it.

09:15.720 --> 09:17.187
Nor does it mean she didn't.

09:17.220 --> 09:19.609
Obviously, there's no shortage
of other suspects,

09:19.660 --> 09:22.151
but Miss Butler seems like
a worthwhile place to start.

09:22.190 --> 09:25.057
(phone chimes)

09:26.800 --> 09:29.769
You saw De_tective Bell
last night, did you not?

09:29.800 --> 09:32.018
Yes, I did.

09:32.070 --> 09:34.732
And?

09:34.770 --> 09:36.863
He's better. He's riding
a desk for now,

09:36.910 --> 09:39.231
but, um, at least
he's up and around.

09:41.140 --> 09:43.904
I will be back
in a bit.
If I'm not here,

09:43.950 --> 09:46.874
I will be at the station,
reviewing case files.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.275
I will text you if I identify
Mr. Hauser's killer

09:49.320 --> 09:51.788
all by my lonesome.

09:58.830 --> 10:01.219
I am sorry about this morning.

10:01.260 --> 10:03.023
I... Ijust...

10:03.070 --> 10:05.789
It's fine. Seriously.

10:05.830 --> 10:08.094
You didn't do anything wrong.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.209
(babeng)

10:11.240 --> 10:14.403
Oh. I can't believe
you have a baby now.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.045
You can't believe it?
Gaugh)

10:17.080 --> 10:19.298
(baby fussing)

10:19.350 --> 10:22.808
So, uh, you said the dad is...

10:22.850 --> 10:24.283
out of the picture?

10:24.320 --> 10:27.050
I can't say
I got any better at picking men

10:27.090 --> 10:29.684
just because I got clean.

10:29.730 --> 10:32.927
Ross, my ex--
as far as bad decisions go,

10:32.960 --> 10:35.155
he's right up there with heroin.

10:35.200 --> 10:36.758
Oh.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.995
But, hey, it got me Shane.

10:39.030 --> 10:41.294
I had no idea

10:41.340 --> 10:43.808
what I was supposed
to do when I saw you.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.899
I didn't know
you'd switched careers, and

10:45.940 --> 10:47.874
with the police around,
I didn't know

10:47.910 --> 10:50.902
ifI was obligated by law
to say that I knew you, or...

10:50.950 --> 10:52.440
Chloe, there is no right
or wrong.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.016
When I run into a former

10:54.050 --> 10:55.972
client in a social setting,
I let them decide

10:56.020 --> 10:57.715
whether they want
to say anything or not.

10:57.750 --> 11:00.981
You were obviously caught
off guard, so I took the lead.

11:01.020 --> 11:04.387
I just try not to tell anyone

11:04.430 --> 11:06.057
about that part of my life.

11:06.090 --> 11:08.729
You know, if-ifI can help it.

11:08.760 --> 11:09.863
Are you still
going to meetings?

11:09.900 --> 11:11.390
Oh, yeah, of course.

11:11.430 --> 11:13.694
No, I-I don't mean
I don't talk to anyone,

11:13.740 --> 11:15.264
Ijust...

11:15.300 --> 11:18.235
take the "anonymous"
part seriously.

11:18.270 --> 11:20.807
Actually, that's
one of the reasons

11:20.840 --> 11:22.171
I wanted
to see you.

11:22.210 --> 11:24.098
With your permission,
I would like to explain

11:24.150 --> 11:25.708
our history
to my partner.

11:25.750 --> 11:28.014
Why?
He's very
perceptive.

11:28.050 --> 11:29.938
He could tell that
you were hiding

11:29.990 --> 11:32.345
something.
He thought it might
have something to do

11:32.390 --> 11:33.982
with what happened
to Donald Hauser.

11:34.020 --> 11:35.954
He thinks I'm a suspect?

11:35.990 --> 11:38.049
You're just someone
who caught his eye.

11:38.090 --> 11:40.058
Look, if you don't
feel comfortable,

11:40.100 --> 11:41.453
I totally
understand.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.990
If you do...

11:43.030 --> 11:44.395
know that our
confidentiality

11:44.430 --> 11:46.125
agreement will
extend to him as well.

11:47.800 --> 11:49.438
I just want to make
sure the investigation

11:49.470 --> 11:50.937
is moving in the
right direction.

11:52.170 --> 11:55.003
You must really trust him.

11:56.140 --> 11:57.778
I do.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.928
Hey.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.951
Can we talk about
Chloe Butler?

12:15.530 --> 12:18.192
In 2009, she was one of the
hottest chefs in the city.

12:18.230 --> 12:20.061
Yes, I saw that
when I looked into her.

12:20.100 --> 12:21.294
Well, you didn't see all of it.

12:21.340 --> 12:22.762
The attention was
too much for her,

12:22.810 --> 12:24.459
and she fell in
with the wrong crowd.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.205
When did she start
working with you?

12:26.240 --> 12:27.502
2011.

12:27.540 --> 12:29.132
She was one of my first clients.

12:29.180 --> 12:31.307
I lived with her for
a little over six months.

12:31.350 --> 12:34.239
It wasn't easy,
but she got her life
back on track.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.919
She knew that the restaurant
scene could be a trigger,

12:36.950 --> 12:38.383
so she started a new business.

12:38.420 --> 12:39.887
As a personal chef.

12:39.920 --> 12:41.319
Yes. So everything you sensed

12:41.360 --> 12:42.554
that she was hiding last night

12:42.590 --> 12:44.057
was about
her past.

12:44.090 --> 12:45.079
And she has an alibi

12:45.130 --> 12:46.529
for the time of the murder.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.096
She was with her sponsor.

12:48.130 --> 12:50.223
Hmm.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.067
Well, it's interesting
that I failed to detect

12:52.100 --> 12:54.364
another addict when I met one.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.038
More interesting that
I didn't get a sense

12:56.070 --> 12:57.901
that you were hiding something
from me, but anyway...

12:57.940 --> 12:59.339
In that case,

12:59.370 --> 13:01.577
we should, uh, focus on
culling our list

13:01.610 --> 13:04.078
of other potential suspects
in Donald Hauser's murder.

13:04.110 --> 13:05.998
I left a voicemail
with the journalist

13:06.050 --> 13:07.574
who broke the story
of his pyramid scheme,

13:07.620 --> 13:09.838
a woman named Rosalie Nuez.

13:09.890 --> 13:12.518
Any luck, she will have some
insight which we can use

13:12.550 --> 13:14.984
to prioritize our investigation
of Hauser's victims.

13:15.020 --> 13:16.419
Actually, Chloe may have
already helped with that.

13:16.460 --> 13:17.586
She didn't think of it
until we were talking,

13:17.630 --> 13:19.325
but she had
an idea who

13:19.360 --> 13:21.521
the last person might've been
to see Hauser alive.

13:21.560 --> 13:25.166
Uh, the director of a nonprofit
named Jacob Weiss.

13:25.200 --> 13:27.896
Hauser had her prepare an
extra meal for last night.

13:27.940 --> 13:31.603
Part of her job is to know
which friends ate what.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.278
I was shocked
when I heard the news.

13:33.310 --> 13:35.608
I-I still don't
believe it.

13:35.640 --> 13:39.041
It couldn't have happened
that many hours after I left.

13:39.080 --> 13:40.877
Our thoughts
exactly.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.047
In fact, we're curious
if you could account

13:43.090 --> 13:45.183
for your whereabouts for
the rest of the evening.

13:45.220 --> 13:48.383
The M.E. puts Mr. Hauser's
death somewhere between
10:00 pm. and midnight.

13:48.420 --> 13:50.559
After I left Donald,
I had a late meeting

13:50.590 --> 13:51.989
at the Palladian Hotel

13:52.030 --> 13:54.191
with a Swiss banker
named Jonas Bitz.

13:54.230 --> 13:56.528
We were there quite late.
I'm sure he or anyone

13:56.560 --> 13:58.369
at the lobby bar
will confirm that.

13:58.400 --> 14:02.905
But... I'm the last person
who had a reason to kill Donald.

14:02.940 --> 14:04.965
Well, it's our understanding
that he handled your...

14:05.010 --> 14:06.534
charity's finances.

14:06.570 --> 14:08.071
Considering everything
that's happened,

14:08.110 --> 14:09.202
_ that would
give you motive.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.377
Actually, it wouldn't.

14:10.410 --> 14:12.071
Do you know what we do here?

14:12.110 --> 14:14.419
You seek reparations
for survivors of the Holocaust.

14:14.450 --> 14:17.419
To this day, Swiss bank accounts
are still being identified

14:17.450 --> 14:20.112
that belong
to Nazi war profiteers.

14:20.160 --> 14:22.116
Our investigators
uncover that money

14:22.160 --> 14:25.652
and process claims on behalf
of survivors and their families.

14:25.690 --> 14:28.250
I can't deny what I'm hearing
in the press about Donald,

14:28.300 --> 14:31.269
but he was my friend.
He donated his services

14:31.300 --> 14:33.439
free of charge,
as this council's CPA.

14:33.470 --> 14:36.189
And as for our investments,

14:36.240 --> 14:38.401
the council never
lost a dime.

14:38.440 --> 14:41.170
Every penny has already
been accounted for.

14:41.210 --> 14:43.246
Can you think of why he might've
left the council alone?

14:43.280 --> 14:45.168
Maybe as he was
stealing from others,

14:45.210 --> 14:48.941
he saw his work for us
as a kind of...

14:48.980 --> 14:51.585
karmic counterbalance, a way
to do some good to make up

14:51.620 --> 14:53.508
for the bad.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.609
Whatever the reason,
I'm grateful.

14:58.260 --> 14:59.989
So, Donald Hauser
was a swindler

15:00.030 --> 15:01.349
with a heart of gold.

15:01.400 --> 15:03.220
Very few of us are
either completely good

15:03.270 --> 15:05.192
or completely evil.
It would appear

15:05.230 --> 15:09.132
that even Hauser had a moral
line that he would_not cross.
(phone ringing)

15:09.170 --> 15:12.606
Excellent. This is Rosalie
Nuez, the reporter I mentioned.

15:12.640 --> 15:15.529
Ms. Nuez, thank you so much
for calling me back.

15:15.580 --> 15:17.445
MAN:
Is this Sherlock Holmes?

15:17.480 --> 15:19.448
It is. Who's this?

15:19.480 --> 15:21.675
This is Detective Luntz
of the NYPD.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.041
You left a voice mail
for Ms. Nuez

15:24.090 --> 15:26.115
saying you were a... consultant?

15:26.150 --> 15:27.356
Idid and I am.

15:27.390 --> 15:29.415
Why do you have her phone?

15:29.460 --> 15:31.678
I think maybe you should join me
at her residence

15:31.730 --> 15:33.948
so I can explain in person.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.993
I may even have some
consulting questions for you.

15:45.010 --> 15:47.274
Well, it looks like Ms. Nuez
was killed by the same person

15:47.310 --> 15:49.005
who murdered Donald Hauser.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.270
The technique used
to bind her, the size

15:51.310 --> 15:53.278
and placement
of the bullet wounds.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.141
I'm quite confident a ballistics
report will confirm that.

15:56.180 --> 15:58.489
Our shooter had a busy
night two nights ago.

15:58.520 --> 16:00.613
M.E. put tentative
time of death

16:00.660 --> 16:03.458
only a few hours after Hauser's.

16:03.490 --> 16:07.051
I'm gonna tell Luntz to put
a rush on ballistics.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.692
WATSON: This doesn't
make any sense.

16:08.730 --> 16:11.198
Why would the same person
want to kill both the man

16:11.230 --> 16:12.367
who stole people's
life's savings

16:12.400 --> 16:14.197
and the reporter
who exposed him?

16:14.240 --> 16:16.231
Seems like if you hated one,

16:16.270 --> 16:17.737
you'd be a fan of the other.

16:17.770 --> 16:19.362
Rare to come across
such a literal case

16:19.410 --> 16:21.401
of someone shooting
the messenger.

16:28.220 --> 16:30.211
Looks like she plugged in
her laptop here.

16:30.250 --> 16:32.411
We should find out
if it's missing.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.302
Come and have a look at this.

16:59.180 --> 17:00.772
The killer entered by force.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.482
Kicked the door here.

17:05.350 --> 17:09.309
Mmm. Sap of the Osage orange,
unless I'm mistaken.

17:09.360 --> 17:10.759
I'm good.

17:10.790 --> 17:12.326
Bit of a misnomer, really.

17:12.360 --> 17:14.191
Aside from a vague...
(sniffs) citrusy scent,

17:14.230 --> 17:15.788
it is unrelated
to the orange.

17:15.830 --> 17:18.128
It's a closer cousin
to the mulberry, actually.

17:18.170 --> 17:19.364
So, killer kicked in the door,

17:19.400 --> 17:21.197
transferred the sap
from his shoe.

17:21.240 --> 17:24.403
Which tells us the most likely
route he took on his way here.

17:27.240 --> 17:29.208
"Monkey balls."

17:29.240 --> 17:31.299
Beg your pardon?

17:31.350 --> 17:34.717
One of the many folk names
for the Osage orange.

17:34.750 --> 17:36.377
Squirrels rip the fruit apart,

17:36.420 --> 17:38.718
spreading the seeds and the sap
on the ground.

17:38.750 --> 17:41.355
This park is the only place
in the vicinity

17:41.390 --> 17:43.221
of Ms. Nuez's apartment
where one is likely

17:43.260 --> 17:44.659
to find one of these.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.385
So you think whoever shot her
walked through here

17:46.430 --> 17:48.398
on his way to her apartment.

17:48.430 --> 17:50.227
And perhaps again when he left.

17:50.270 --> 17:52.226
(cell phone ringtone playing)

17:52.270 --> 17:53.498
Isn't that Alfredo's ringtone?

17:53.540 --> 17:55.167
Yes, he's been harassing me.
I promised

17:55.200 --> 17:56.838
I would go to a meeting
with him yesterday,

17:56.870 --> 17:58.235
but the investigation
took precedence.

17:58.270 --> 17:59.362
It still does.

17:59.410 --> 18:01.708
(skateboards clacking,
boys laughing)

18:01.740 --> 18:02.832
BOY:
Check it out,
check it out!

18:02.880 --> 18:04.472
Behold, Watson,

18:04.510 --> 18:06.444
a generation lost
to narcissism.

18:06.480 --> 18:08.710
A populace who believes
that no experience is

18:08.750 --> 18:10.286
worth having
unless it's been uploaded

18:10.320 --> 18:12.743
and received
its fair share of hits,

18:12.790 --> 18:14.587
for whom the pinnacle of
achievement is having the moment

18:14.620 --> 18:16.713
you crush your genitalia
on a metal railing

18:16.760 --> 18:18.853
achieve "meme" status.

18:18.890 --> 18:23.623
And yet their self-absorption
may, in this instance, serve us.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.161
I happen to know from my
police scanner that the police

18:26.200 --> 18:28.589
are often called to this park
to chase skateboarders away.

18:28.640 --> 18:32.428
They are, to the dismay of some
parkgoers, here at all hours.

18:32.470 --> 18:35.633
So if they were here two nights
ago when the killer walked by,

18:35.680 --> 18:38.604
one of them might have caught
them on their cell phone.

18:38.650 --> 18:41.813
(cell phone ringtone plays)
I will talk
to the narcissists.

18:41.850 --> 18:43.647
You go meet Alfredo
so you can get to a meeting.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.783
I've stitched up
a lot of these guys

18:45.820 --> 18:48.618
back during my E.R. rotation.
I know how to talk to them.

18:48.660 --> 18:50.525
You speak idiot?

18:50.560 --> 18:53.154
You also don't seem like
you're in the greatest mood.

18:53.200 --> 18:54.292
This might need a softer touch.

18:54.330 --> 18:56.298
I'll let you know

18:56.330 --> 18:58.423
if anything turns up.

19:03.670 --> 19:05.365
You're not Alfredo.

19:05.410 --> 19:07.674
You're Sherlock, right?

19:07.710 --> 19:08.870
And you are?

19:08.910 --> 19:10.639
Randy.

19:11.680 --> 19:14.274
Name or adjective?
What?

19:14.320 --> 19:16.675
Short for "Randall"?
Or state of sexual arousal?

19:16.720 --> 19:18.642
Are you asking me if I'm horny?

19:18.690 --> 19:21.318
Well, cars like this can have
that effect on some men.

19:21.360 --> 19:22.349
ALFREDO:
Sherlock,

19:22.390 --> 19:25.382
I see you
guys have met.

19:25.430 --> 19:29.548
Ah. I thought for a moment that
your home had been infiltrated.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.568
I see that's not the case.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.465
No, Randy and I met at a
meeting a few weeks ago.

19:33.500 --> 19:35.195
Three months sober.

19:35.240 --> 19:37.367
He's been going it
alone for now, but...

19:37.410 --> 19:39.560
we were talking a few
nights ago, and...

19:39.610 --> 19:42.238
we think he might
benefit from a sponsor.

19:44.250 --> 19:47.447
Yep. Yep. A wise decision.

19:47.480 --> 19:50.540
Yeah. And a... excellent choice.

19:50.590 --> 19:53.457
Yeah, um,
Alfredo has, uh,

19:53.490 --> 19:56.357
helped me profoundly
over the last 18 months, so, uh,

19:56.390 --> 19:59.655
yeah, you're in excellent hands.

19:59.690 --> 20:01.351
Actually, I
was thinking

20:01.400 --> 20:03.288
that you might be
the man for the job.

20:03.330 --> 20:05.298
RAN DY:
Alfredo tells me

20:05.330 --> 20:06.695
I can learn a lot from you.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.334
Yeah. Um...

20:10.370 --> 20:13.271
could you just...
Could you give us a moment?

20:13.310 --> 20:15.301
We'll just be one
second, all right?

20:19.610 --> 20:21.749
(quietly):
You're joking.

20:21.780 --> 20:23.418
Do you think the idea of you

20:23.450 --> 20:24.747
becoming a sponsor is funny?
Because I don't.

20:24.790 --> 20:27.384
I've been thinking about
it for a while, okay?

20:27.420 --> 20:29.513
The stuff you said the other
night pretty much sealed it.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.255
What "stuff"?

20:31.290 --> 20:32.382
Do you want to know
why you've been

20:32.430 --> 20:33.692
so agitated
for the last few weeks?

20:33.730 --> 20:35.425
Why you've been
so distracted?

20:35.460 --> 20:37.769
Because you feel bad about
what happened to your friend.

20:37.800 --> 20:39.392
I told you.

20:39.430 --> 20:41.398
I was completely in the right.

20:41.440 --> 20:44.261
Maybe for the old you,
that would've been enough.

20:44.310 --> 20:45.459
But not now.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.398
You're different now.

20:47.440 --> 20:49.499
You committed yourself
to the program

20:49.540 --> 20:51.405
and now you heard other people
tell their stories.

20:51.450 --> 20:53.441
And a little empathy crept in.

20:53.480 --> 20:54.447
That's what's
supposed to happen.

20:54.480 --> 20:56.448
That's how it works.

20:56.480 --> 20:59.278
You want to help Detective
Bell, but he won't let you.

20:59.320 --> 21:00.753
That is a good instinct to have.

21:00.790 --> 21:02.382
Why not try to apply it

21:02.420 --> 21:05.059
somewhere else?

21:05.090 --> 21:07.490
Being a sponsor
means being available.

21:07.530 --> 21:09.395
You know me. You know my work.

21:09.430 --> 21:10.692
It's all-consuming.

21:10.730 --> 21:12.368
You find time for meetings,
don't you?

21:12.400 --> 21:14.891
(phone chimes)

21:14.940 --> 21:16.965
Oh.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.366
I'm sorry. I won't be able

21:19.410 --> 21:21.401
to make this evening's meeting
after all.

21:21.440 --> 21:22.634
Duty calls.

21:22.680 --> 21:24.705
As it always will.

21:28.550 --> 21:30.916
(sighs)

21:30.950 --> 21:32.884
(footsteps approaching)

21:34.590 --> 21:36.888
Any luck?
Aside from getting
a master class

21:36.920 --> 21:39.855
in the difference between
a switch and a fakie, no.

21:39.890 --> 21:43.519
No one walking by
jumped out as suspicious.

21:43.570 --> 21:45.026
How was the meeting?

21:45.070 --> 21:47.561
Probably quite good.
I will never know.

21:47.600 --> 21:48.760
Because as soon as
I got to Alfredo's,

21:48.800 --> 21:49.994
I was the victim
of an ambush.

21:50.040 --> 21:51.905
What are you talking about?

21:51.940 --> 21:54.704
He expressed his opinion that
it was time I became a sponsor.

21:54.740 --> 21:56.037
Oh.

21:56.080 --> 21:57.741
And what did you say?

21:57.780 --> 21:59.748
Itold him my life is not
conducive to making myself

21:59.780 --> 22:01.919
available every time
someone else was in crisis.

22:01.950 --> 22:03.713
You do get
that no one's life is, right?

22:05.690 --> 22:08.011
Oh, my God.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.482
What is it?

22:09.520 --> 22:11.829
WATSON:
The man with the bag.

22:11.860 --> 22:12.849
I know him.

22:12.890 --> 22:13.993
Small world.

22:14.030 --> 22:15.622
Not th small.

22:15.660 --> 22:17.764
I don't remember his name.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.530
We crossed paths
when I first started
working with Chloe.

22:20.570 --> 22:22.595
He came to her apartment
one night.
Are you saying

22:22.640 --> 22:24.801
there's a connection between
Chloe Butler, who discovered

22:24.840 --> 22:26.535
Donald Hauser's body,
and a man seen

22:26.570 --> 22:28.470
in the vicinity
of Rosalie Nuez's apartment

22:28.510 --> 22:30.501
shortly after her murder?

22:32.050 --> 22:35.019
You're right--
the world is not that small.

22:35.050 --> 22:38.816
I can't believe it,
but yeah, that's Nelson.

22:38.850 --> 22:41.785
Nelson Maddox.
You said this was taken

22:41.820 --> 22:44.550
outside the apartment
of the reporter who died?

22:44.590 --> 22:46.057
A few blocks away.

22:47.090 --> 22:48.694
You know how

22:48.730 --> 22:50.027
I recognized him, right?

22:51.070 --> 22:53.026
You were here that night.

22:53.070 --> 22:55.163
The night he came over.

22:55.200 --> 22:58.067
WATSON:
He was yelling at you.
I mean, I assumed

22:58.110 --> 22:59.839
he was your ex, but...

22:59.870 --> 23:02.407
you didn't want to talk
about it, so I didn't push.

23:02.440 --> 23:05.705
Nelson and I were...

23:05.750 --> 23:07.149
together...

23:07.180 --> 23:09.546
when I was using.
Donald used to bring him

23:09.580 --> 23:12.515
into the restaurant
when I still worked there.

23:12.550 --> 23:14.552
He introduced us.

23:14.590 --> 23:17.923
Uh, Nelson said
he was an entrepreneur.

23:17.960 --> 23:21.919
But then I realized that was
his way of saying "criminal."

23:21.960 --> 23:23.996
What kind of criminal?

23:24.030 --> 23:25.827
I don't know.
Something with drugs.

23:25.870 --> 23:27.599
He always had a fix,

23:27.640 --> 23:29.631
and back then,
that's all that mattered to me.

23:31.540 --> 23:33.679
But after rehab...

23:33.710 --> 23:37.908
I told him that
I couldn't see him again, and...

23:37.950 --> 23:39.804
he got angry, and...

23:39.850 --> 23:41.909
(crying):
he came to see me...

23:41.950 --> 23:44.510
It's okay, take your time.

23:44.550 --> 23:46.108
I never saw
him again,

23:46.150 --> 23:49.688
not till you showed me
his picture.
How did he

23:49.720 --> 23:50.926
and Donald
know each other?

23:50.960 --> 23:52.621
Was Nelson
a busmess client?

23:52.660 --> 23:55.652
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm pretty sure he was.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.668
Well, if Donald swindled him,

23:57.700 --> 23:59.964
then he would have motive
to kill him.

24:00.000 --> 24:02.833
But why hurt Rosalie?

24:02.870 --> 24:04.701
Joan".

24:04.740 --> 24:07.732
you know you can't
tell anyone about this.

24:07.780 --> 24:11.170
The only reason that
you recognized Nelson

24:11.210 --> 24:13.747
was because you were here
as my sober companion.

24:13.780 --> 24:16.044
If you tell the police
how you knew him,

24:16.080 --> 24:18.947
you're gonna have to tell them
about me, about my past.

24:18.990 --> 24:22.915
Chloe... I know you don't like
to talk about it, but...

24:22.960 --> 24:24.222
You don't understand.

24:24.260 --> 24:27.081
I am in a custody battle
for Shane.

24:27.130 --> 24:30.497
His father doesn't know anything
about my life before.

24:30.530 --> 24:31.963
Wh-What do you mean?

24:32.000 --> 24:33.638
The lawyers
don't know.

24:33.670 --> 24:35.069
The court doesn't know.

24:35.100 --> 24:37.193
If it comes out now
that I'm an addict,

24:37.240 --> 24:39.561
I mean, i-it looks
like I hid it--

24:39.610 --> 24:42.499
they could use it
to take Shane away.

24:42.540 --> 24:44.076
Two people are dead.

24:45.710 --> 24:47.746
And that kills me, Joan.

24:47.780 --> 24:51.682
But you signed a
confidentiality agreement.

24:51.720 --> 24:54.757
You gave your word
that you would protect me.

24:56.820 --> 24:58.959
I am sorry...

24:58.990 --> 25:02.596
but if you want
to connect Nelson to Donald,

25:02.630 --> 25:05.167
you're gonna have
to find another way.

25:12.770 --> 25:15.079
Let's make sure
I understand you--
we now have a name

25:15.110 --> 25:17.999
to put to the face
of the man that we believe

25:18.050 --> 25:20.610
brutally murdered
Donald Hauser and Rosalie Nuez,

25:20.650 --> 25:23.619
but we can't share it
with the authorities?

25:23.650 --> 25:26.585
Not unless we
can connect _the dots
Without involvmg Chloe.

25:26.620 --> 25:28.588
Which, in this case,
is the same thing,

25:28.620 --> 25:29.917
because Chloe is the connection.

25:29.960 --> 25:32.554
And all this
over a promise

25:32.590 --> 25:34.251
you made in another career?

25:34.300 --> 25:36.097
Yes. Just like the
promise I made you

25:36.130 --> 25:37.791
when we first started
working together.

25:37.830 --> 25:39.991
Uh, what was it you told
people I was back then?

25:40.030 --> 25:42.066
Ah. A personal valet.

25:42.100 --> 25:45.228
If our confidentiality
agreement had ever come
between us and a murderer,

25:45.270 --> 25:47.738
I would have exposed myself
as an addict in a heartbeat.

25:47.780 --> 25:49.634
This is not about
Chloe being ashamed.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.807
It's bigger than that--
she could lose her child.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.715
That's unlikely even if
the boy's father did find out,

25:53.750 --> 25:56.810
and it's far from a certainty
that he will.

25:56.850 --> 25:58.715
Donald Hauser _
was an execrable human being.

25:58.750 --> 25:59.910
Rosalie Nuez was not.

25:59.950 --> 26:01.759
She had a family;
they loved her.

26:01.790 --> 26:04.179
She had friends, colleagues--
many people consider her a hero

26:04.230 --> 26:06.687
for exposing Hauser...
This is not up for discussion.

26:06.730 --> 26:09.324
We have to find another way
to connect Maddox to Hauser.

26:09.360 --> 26:12.693
And while we look
for this other connection,

26:12.730 --> 26:14.834
Mr. Maddox remains at large,

26:14.870 --> 26:17.088
_ free to cover
his tracks or disappear.
We should at least

26:17.140 --> 26:19.267
tell the captain
what we've uncovered.
Explain the Situation,

26:19.310 --> 26:21.699
but make it clear that Chloe's
identity is to remain a secret.

26:21.740 --> 26:23.844
I suggested that,
okay? She said no.

26:23.880 --> 26:25.677
What if we do it anyway?
Why must she ever know?

26:25.710 --> 26:27.268
So your solution is
to make a liar out of me,

26:27.310 --> 26:28.948
after I told her
that she could trust you?

26:28.980 --> 26:31.380
I have us at the very doorstep
of a solution, Watson!

26:31.420 --> 26:33.752
Did you not learn anything
from what happened to Bell?

26:33.790 --> 26:36.179
He got hurt because of
choices that we made!

26:36.220 --> 26:39.189
There was no way to predict that
he would be placed in danger.

26:39.230 --> 26:41.858
Just like there's no way to know
what's gonna happen to Chloe

26:41.900 --> 26:43.697
if we drag her name
into this investigation.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.765
(sighs)

26:53.370 --> 26:56.203
(car engine starts, revs)

27:01.380 --> 27:04.110
(engine idling)

27:17.100 --> 27:19.125
(engine continues idling)

27:28.210 --> 27:29.336
(engine turns off)

27:29.380 --> 27:31.143
(mechanical whirring)

27:31.180 --> 27:32.875
You beat the alarm.

27:32.910 --> 27:33.979
Only a matter of time.

27:34.020 --> 27:35.271
And my home alarm.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.947
Child's play.

27:36.980 --> 27:39.187
Not really befitting
a man in your line of work.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.857
You might want to replace these.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.349
(sighs)

27:59.410 --> 28:01.878
(exhales)

28:01.910 --> 28:05.846
Well, obviously you want
to talk, so talk.

28:07.110 --> 28:09.078
I've always had compassion

28:09.120 --> 28:12.044
for_ the victims of the
crimes I investigate.

28:14.890 --> 28:18.951
My capacity to place myself
in other people's shoes,

28:18.990 --> 28:22.221
to imagine what they're
thinking and feeling, is a...

28:22.260 --> 28:25.058
is a necessary skill
in determining motive.

28:25.100 --> 28:27.295
One at which I excel.

28:29.100 --> 28:30.806
This capacity...

28:30.840 --> 28:34.207
has never been a
detriment to my work.

28:34.240 --> 28:36.037
Lately, however...

28:36.080 --> 28:38.105
Bell's been on your
mind; I get it.

28:38.150 --> 28:39.799
And you would risk
exacerbating this problem

28:39.850 --> 28:41.272
by assigning me a sponsee.

28:41.320 --> 28:42.969
No one's
"assigning" you anything.

28:43.020 --> 28:44.749
That's not how it works.

28:44.790 --> 28:46.781
I just think you're ready.

28:46.820 --> 28:48.515
You think it's gonna...

28:48.560 --> 28:50.926
focus me,
and provide a relief valve

28:50.960 --> 28:52.518
for all the feelings
I've been having

28:52.560 --> 28:54.528
regarding
the detective's situation.

28:54.560 --> 28:59.168
Even ifI did, there's
one thing you got to remember.

28:59.200 --> 29:02.089
It's not about you.

29:02.140 --> 29:03.767
(exhales)

29:03.810 --> 29:06.461
You've gotten a lot
out of the program.

29:06.510 --> 29:09.729
Don't you think it's time
to give something back?

29:35.240 --> 29:37.435
(sighs)

29:38.870 --> 29:41.202
Early start, I see.

29:41.240 --> 29:43.401
Late night, actually.
I tried to sleep but couldn't,

29:43.440 --> 29:45.044
so I stayed at it.

29:45.080 --> 29:48.345
Chloe said Maddox was
a client of Hauser's,

29:48.380 --> 29:50.416
but his name is not in any
of Hauser's accounts.

29:50.450 --> 29:52.441
I've been over_the
records a dozen times--

29:52.490 --> 29:54.287
I cannot find a link
between the two.

29:54.320 --> 29:56.550
If we were able to establish
that Maddox lost money

29:56.590 --> 29:59.423
on Hauser's pyramid scheme,
we would have our connection

29:59.460 --> 30:01.428
without implicating Chloe...

30:01.460 --> 30:03.428
as well as Maddox's
motive for murder.

30:03.460 --> 30:05.189
In the meantime,
I sent Captain Gregson

30:05.230 --> 30:06.527
the video of Maddox in the park

30:06.570 --> 30:08.390
and convinced him
to release it to the press.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.431
You were right.

30:10.470 --> 30:13.234
If we bring him in,
it'll at least buy us some time.

30:13.270 --> 30:16.433
And getting him in a room might
shake out another connection.

30:16.480 --> 30:19.904
Did you tell the captain
about Chloe?
No. Remember how

30:19.950 --> 30:22.316
I noticed Rosalie's laptop
was missing from her apartment?

30:22.350 --> 30:24.443
Well, I looked into it--
it never turned up.

30:24.490 --> 30:27.141
Then I told the captain
about the sap on Rosalie's door

30:27.190 --> 30:29.249
and how that led us to the park.

30:29.290 --> 30:30.609
Then I sent him the video

30:30.660 --> 30:32.981
of Maddox walking away
with a laptop bag

30:33.030 --> 30:35.453
slung over his shoulder right
around the time of the murder.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.252
I couldn't give him
Maddox's name

30:37.300 --> 30:38.927
without bringing up, Chloe,
of course,

30:38.970 --> 30:40.392
but at least his
face is out there.

30:40.430 --> 30:43.092
I know it's not ideal.

30:43.140 --> 30:44.630
But given the circumstances,

30:44.670 --> 30:48.436
it was quite literally
all that we could do.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.334
Well done.

30:51.510 --> 30:53.341
(electronic dinging)

30:54.550 --> 30:56.518
It's Captain Gregson.

30:56.550 --> 30:58.415
Someone saw Maddox's
face on the news

30:58.450 --> 31:00.315
and called in a tip.

31:00.350 --> 31:01.988
WATSON:
A member of your outreach staff

31:02.020 --> 31:03.510
met him_at
a fund-raiser

31:03.560 --> 31:05.357
your organization threw
about a year ago.

31:05.390 --> 31:07.426
She dug up
the guest list for us.

31:07.460 --> 31:08.495
The list gave
us a name:

31:08.530 --> 31:10.327
Nelson Maddox.

31:10.360 --> 31:12.260
I remember him.

31:12.300 --> 31:14.393
I met him through Donald.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.260
I-I think Donald
was the one

31:16.300 --> 31:18.336
who invited him
to the fund-raiser.

31:18.370 --> 31:19.632
Do you think
you'd be able to shed

31:19.670 --> 31:20.659
any light
on their relationship?

31:20.710 --> 31:22.530
Donald introduced him

31:22.580 --> 31:24.104
as another client.

31:24.150 --> 31:28.075
Uh... I think he had something
to do with the art world.

31:29.620 --> 31:31.918
In fact, he donated
a few paintings

31:31.950 --> 31:33.611
to the auction
that night.

31:33.650 --> 31:35.481
I'm pretty sure
they all sold.

31:36.690 --> 31:39.523
Thank you. This
was very helpful.

31:39.560 --> 31:42.222
(sighs) He said Maddox
was a client of Hauser's

31:42.260 --> 31:43.921
who was involved
in the art world.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.699
I have been all over
that client list--

31:45.730 --> 31:48.597
the only thing that comes close
is an art gallery in Chelsea.

31:48.640 --> 31:50.528
Maddox's name was not
associated with it.

31:50.570 --> 31:53.607
But do you think he may
have been a silent partner?

31:53.640 --> 31:57.474
Well, it would explain where
he got all the art he donated.

31:58.480 --> 31:59.970
WOMAN:
Sorry, mm...

32:00.010 --> 32:01.978
no.
You don't know him?

32:02.020 --> 32:03.248
Mm-mm.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.419
Fabiana,
did you say it was?

32:05.450 --> 32:07.486
Fabiana, would it
be safe to assume

32:07.520 --> 32:10.455
that you are not the owner
of this establishment?

32:10.490 --> 32:12.026
Why you assume that?

32:12.060 --> 32:13.550
I mean no disrespect.

32:13.590 --> 32:15.524
I'm sure you're a valued
member of the team.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.528
But do you know
the owner, or owners?

32:17.560 --> 32:20.666
Of course.
WATSON: But you don't know
the man in the photograph.

32:20.700 --> 32:23.567
And the name Nelson Maddox
doesn't mean anything to you?

32:23.600 --> 32:25.033
No. Sorry.

32:25.070 --> 32:26.537
HOLMES:
Uh, do you mind

32:26.570 --> 32:27.969
if we peruse?

32:28.010 --> 32:29.671
Huge fans of
the neo-deconceptualists.

32:29.710 --> 32:31.041
Sure.

32:31.080 --> 32:32.707
Thank you.

32:34.580 --> 32:36.514
Neo-deconceptualists?

32:36.550 --> 32:38.211
Not a thing.

32:38.250 --> 32:40.639
Don't tell Fabiana--
it might crush her.

32:40.690 --> 32:42.658
So she was
obviously lying

32:42.690 --> 32:44.681
about not knowing
Nelson Maddox.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.357
Yeah, obviously.

32:52.030 --> 32:54.066
(sighs)

32:58.140 --> 32:59.562
Excuse me.

33:04.710 --> 33:06.575
You see something?

33:09.050 --> 33:12.611
Fabiana, did you open up
the gallery this morning?

33:12.650 --> 33:14.083
Yeah.

33:14.120 --> 33:15.485
Nothing out
of the ordinary?

33:15.520 --> 33:16.680
No.

33:16.720 --> 33:19.120
No.

33:21.560 --> 33:24.768
Heel scuffs on the floor.

33:24.800 --> 33:26.665
Yeah.

33:26.700 --> 33:29.669
Looks like
someone was dragged.

33:29.700 --> 33:32.100
Out here.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.529
(door squeaks open)

33:57.700 --> 33:59.691
*

34:19.350 --> 34:21.716
(Watson gasping)

34:21.760 --> 34:23.751
Would you care to
revise your answers?

34:23.790 --> 34:25.121
Because it would appear

34:25.160 --> 34:26.627
that Nelson Maddox
has some connection

34:26.660 --> 34:28.355
to this gallery after all.

34:33.630 --> 34:35.791
So, Maddox's car

34:35.840 --> 34:38.331
was parked up the block,
and inside it,

34:38.370 --> 34:41.806
we found the gun,
right caliber, and the same

34:41.840 --> 34:45.401
kind of rope used to bind
Donald Hauser and Rosalie Nuez.

34:45.450 --> 34:49.341
Now, under the circumstances,
Fabiana admitted

34:49.380 --> 34:53.180
that Maddox was
a silent partner, and

34:53.220 --> 34:56.678
that _his_main line of work
was distributing street drugs

34:56.720 --> 34:58.824
to a discreet level
of clientele.

34:58.860 --> 35:01.351
As in, a dealer
for rich people.

35:01.400 --> 35:03.254
Presumably, her employers
were not fond of admitting

35:03.300 --> 35:04.824
they had a drug dealer
as an investor.

35:04.870 --> 35:07.259
Hence, her
initial silence.

35:07.300 --> 35:09.598
GREGSON:
So Maddox had money tied up
in the gallery,

35:09.640 --> 35:12.200
and the gallery was a client
of Donald Hauser's.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.731
So, that explains
why Maddox killed Hauser.

35:14.780 --> 35:17.499
Now, the question is,
who killed Maddox?

35:17.540 --> 35:19.701
And why did Maddox
kill Rosalie Nuez and

35:19.750 --> 35:21.217
steal her laptop?

35:21.250 --> 35:22.842
She must have found something

35:22.880 --> 35:24.882
on Maddox when she researched
Hauser's pyramid scam.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.717
But if his only
connection to Hauser

35:26.750 --> 35:29.753
was this gallery, what's so
incriminating about that?

35:31.830 --> 35:33.786
Watson, I think you're right.

35:33.830 --> 35:35.821
About what?

35:35.860 --> 35:37.748
That Rosalie Nuez knew

35:37.800 --> 35:40.360
that there was more to this
gallery than meets the eye.

35:40.400 --> 35:41.731
The red dots

35:41.770 --> 35:43.431
on the wall
that are placed next

35:43.470 --> 35:44.732
to some of the pieces.

35:44.770 --> 35:46.533
As you would find
in any such establishment,

35:46.570 --> 35:47.730
they're placed next
to an item to indicate

35:47.770 --> 35:49.374
that that particular item
has been sold.

35:49.410 --> 35:51.640
But in this gallery...

35:51.680 --> 35:55.138
the dots are consistently placed
next to every third piece.

35:56.980 --> 35:58.709
As if a single individual,

35:58.750 --> 36:03.619
walking at a relatively
steady pace, circled the room,

36:03.660 --> 36:06.857
peeling off dots...

36:06.890 --> 36:09.222
randomly designating

36:09.260 --> 36:11.364
certain pieces as sold.

36:11.400 --> 36:13.868
Reality would never be so tidy.

36:13.900 --> 36:17.791
What we have here
is a shoddily executed lie.

36:17.840 --> 36:19.728
I submit that these dots

36:19.770 --> 36:21.374
exist to make
it look like

36:21.410 --> 36:23.298
business is being
conducted in here.

36:23.340 --> 36:25.706
Whereas, in truth,
the gallery in which we stand

36:25.750 --> 36:28.218
is much more likely
a money-laundering front.

36:28.250 --> 36:29.808
(camera shutter clicking)

36:29.850 --> 36:31.738
Fabiana?

36:31.790 --> 36:34.384
Can I trouble you
for one more thing? Your books.

36:34.420 --> 36:36.388
If these items on the walls
have indeed been sold,

36:36.420 --> 36:39.389
you must maintain a record of
whom they've been sold to, yes?

36:39.430 --> 36:41.853
Yes.

36:45.300 --> 36:47.768
You wanted to see me?

36:47.800 --> 36:51.406
Jacob Weiss, this is
Captain Gregson of the NYPD.

36:52.740 --> 36:53.707
How do you do?

36:53.740 --> 36:55.833
Magnificent work you do.

36:55.880 --> 36:58.508
Setting right, in at
least some small way,

36:58.550 --> 37:01.974
such a horrific wrong
done decades ago.

37:02.020 --> 37:05.615
I wonder how some of the
Holocaust survwors would feel,

37:05.650 --> 37:08.778
knowing that money had
been claimed in their names

37:08.820 --> 37:12.927
without them knowing,
or-or even seeing a dime.

37:12.960 --> 37:13.619
Excuse me?

37:13.660 --> 37:15.252
You've been embezzling millions

37:15.300 --> 37:16.892
from your own
charity by filing

37:16.930 --> 37:18.921
_ false claims _
in the names of survwors

37:18.970 --> 37:21.791
who are either dead, or who were
simply never informed.

37:21.840 --> 37:23.592
How-how dare you accuse me...?!

37:23.640 --> 37:25.505
This is a list of people

37:25.540 --> 37:28.008
who supposedly bought artwork
from Nelson Maddox's gallery.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.837
The same gallery
that you claimed

37:29.880 --> 37:31.370
to know absolutely
nothing about.

37:31.410 --> 37:32.809
Funny thing is,

37:32.850 --> 37:34.909
I remember seeing all of
these names somewhere before.

37:34.950 --> 37:37.976
Here, on this
sculpture.

37:38.020 --> 37:39.908
It's quite a
coincidence, isn't it?

37:39.950 --> 37:42.851
So many of the
gallery's customers

37:42.890 --> 37:44.926
being survivors
that you'd helped.

37:44.960 --> 37:47.485
WATSON:
You and Nelson Maddox
were business partners.

37:47.530 --> 37:49.828
You laundered the embezzled
money through his gallery.

37:49.860 --> 37:51.623
_ _That was _
the incriminating eVIdence

37:51.670 --> 37:52.967
in Donald Hauser's files.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.661
HOLMES:
We strongly suspect

37:54.700 --> 37:55.962
that, as the
charity's CPA,

37:56.000 --> 37:58.309
Hau_ser realized what was
gomg on, and even he

37:58.340 --> 37:59.705
couldn't stomach it.

37:59.740 --> 38:01.037
When his own
house of cards

38:01.070 --> 38:02.674
came tumbling down,

38:02.710 --> 38:04.644
and he decided
to take his own life,

38:04.680 --> 38:06.602
he also decided
to share what he knew

38:06.650 --> 38:08.743
about your scheme
with Rosalie Nuez.

38:08.780 --> 38:10.008
In your own words,

38:10.050 --> 38:11.915
perhaps it was
a "karmic counterbalance."

38:11.950 --> 38:14.657
WATSON:
We think his mistake was
giving you a heads-up.

38:14.690 --> 38:17.318
Probably when the two of you
had dinner a few nights ago.

38:17.360 --> 38:20.579
That gave you time to contact
Maddox, who then tortured

38:20.630 --> 38:22.450
out of Hauser
what he'd done with the files.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.991
Maddox then killed Rosalie,
and took her laptop.

38:25.030 --> 38:26.725
HOLMES:
When you saw on
the news that we had

38:26.770 --> 38:28.328
identified Maddox as the killer,

38:28.370 --> 38:30.861
you killed him
to cover your tracks.

38:30.900 --> 38:32.731
GREGSON:
We're already working
our way down

38:32.770 --> 38:34.670
that list
of supposed art buyers.

38:34.710 --> 38:38.407
So far, not one of them
or their families had any idea

38:38.450 --> 38:40.577
they'd been awarded
six-figure settlements.

38:40.610 --> 38:41.918
I don't suppose you'd like

38:41.950 --> 38:44.384
to explain
why that is.

38:50.060 --> 38:51.687
Oh, sorry. I was, uh...

38:51.730 --> 38:53.584
I was looking
for Captain Gregson.

38:53.630 --> 38:54.995
Detective Bell.

38:55.030 --> 38:56.827
That's all right.
Come in.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.661
Frank Da Silva.

39:02.700 --> 39:04.759
(laughs)
Have a seat.

39:04.810 --> 39:07.062
As in,
Deputy Commissioner Da Silva?

39:07.110 --> 39:10.034
Captain Gregson was nice enough
to lend us his office

39:10.080 --> 39:11.900
so that we could
speak privately.

39:11.950 --> 39:17.070
What do you know
about my division, Detective?

39:17.120 --> 39:19.588
I got a pretty
goodidea.

39:19.620 --> 39:22.054
You're in charge of an
intelligence unit? Surveillance?

39:22.090 --> 39:23.910
It's called
the Demographics Unit.

39:23.960 --> 39:26.019
(laughs)

39:26.060 --> 39:28.449
The-the name's not mine.

39:28.500 --> 39:31.867
(laughs)
To me, uh,
being so euphemistic--

39:31.900 --> 39:35.688
it's, um, makes it sound like
you're doing something wrong.

39:35.740 --> 39:37.935
And we're not.

39:37.970 --> 39:40.530
We're just...

39:40.570 --> 39:42.879
keeping an eye out
on certain groups.

39:42.910 --> 39:44.969
Listening
for concerning chatter.

39:45.010 --> 39:46.978
I think if you took

39:47.010 --> 39:49.410
a close look _
at what we've been d0ing,

39:49.450 --> 39:51.941
you'd agree that
we're keeping the city safe.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.412
You don't have
to conVInce me...

39:53.450 --> 39:55.657
No, but I'd like to.
Sir?

39:55.690 --> 39:57.055
I wanted to talk to you

39:57.090 --> 39:59.786
because your situation has been
brought to my attention.

39:59.830 --> 40:06.463
I'm told that you are
an exceptional detective.

40:06.500 --> 40:09.765
You're a man with a good head
on his shoulders,

40:09.800 --> 40:12.735
who, by no fault of his own,

40:12.770 --> 40:15.637
may be staring at a desk job

40:15.680 --> 40:20.174
for a good, long time.

40:22.180 --> 40:23.977
Or...

40:24.020 --> 40:26.488
you could come work for me.

40:28.250 --> 40:31.959
Does that interest you,
Detective?

40:33.730 --> 40:38.121
Would you care to help protect
your city from the next attack?

40:42.870 --> 40:45.100
(clears throat)

40:47.640 --> 40:49.471
(doorbell rings)

40:49.510 --> 40:50.704
(clears throat)

40:50.740 --> 40:52.105
Enter!

40:56.920 --> 40:59.480
Randall, thank you for coming.

41:00.720 --> 41:02.859
Sure.

41:05.690 --> 41:07.749
Cool place.

41:11.160 --> 41:13.594
Won't you please sit down?

41:28.980 --> 41:30.743
(laughs)
Look, man...

41:30.780 --> 41:33.647
if you don't want
to be my sponsor, it's all good.

41:33.690 --> 41:34.679
I do.

41:35.820 --> 41:37.981
I do.

41:44.870 --> 41:49.068
When I chose_ Alfredo to be
my sponsor, I did so on a whim.

41:49.100 --> 41:52.228
I felt pressure to find one,
so I chose him at random.

41:52.270 --> 41:54.579
I had very low expectations
of him,

41:54.610 --> 41:56.237
and of sponsorship, in general.

41:56.280 --> 41:59.204
Didn't think
I needed either.

42:00.310 --> 42:03.108
I was wrong.

42:03.150 --> 42:09.180
He has taught me how to get the
very most out of the program.

42:09.220 --> 42:11.188
He did not coddle me.

42:11.220 --> 42:13.324
And so, if we choose
to formalize our relationship,

42:13.360 --> 42:15.225
I will not coddle you.

42:15.260 --> 42:16.727
If you have come
seeking a friend,

42:16.760 --> 42:18.227
look elsewhere.

42:18.260 --> 42:19.659
If you need a therapist,

42:21.370 --> 42:25.261
I will only ever be
your sponsor.

42:25.310 --> 42:27.039
I will share
with you my methods,

42:27.070 --> 42:29.903
and hope that your commitment to
sobriety is as great as my own.

42:29.940 --> 42:32.841
Are these terms acceptable?

42:32.880 --> 42:35.246
You're sober.

42:35.280 --> 42:39.114
You have been
for a long time now.

42:39.150 --> 42:41.345
Of course
I find the terms acceptable.
