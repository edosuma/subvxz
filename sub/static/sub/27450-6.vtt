Well, I know a little something

06:50.867 --> 06:53.100
about Hercules,

06:53.200 --> 06:55.934
and what made him a hero

06:53.200 --> 06:55.934
wasn't just his power.

06:56.033 --> 06:59.934
It was his determination in

06:56.033 --> 06:59.934

07:00.033 --> 07:02.900
Matt, Jon, you beat the odds

07:03.000 --> 07:05.133

07:05.233 --> 07:07.300
to be a Titan,

07:07.400 --> 07:09.567

09:55.066 --> 09:57.066
met in July in the combine,

And then when we got out here,

09:59.734 --> 10:02.600
we reconnected,

10:02.700 --> 10:05.166
started training together,

14:44.600 --> 14:46.633
<i>than just the backswing.</i>

14:46.734 --> 14:48.033
<i>You have to follow through</i>

[Liam]<i> So Ashley Hawkins</i>

15:50.900 --> 15:53.633
[dramatic music]

15:55.633 --> 15:58.767
Success in these games

15:55.633 --> 15:58.767
is about keeping a steady stride

15:58.867 --> 16:01.200
and not getting

15:58.867 --> 16:01.200
too confident too early.

16:01.300 --> 16:03.166
It's also about

16:01.300 --> 16:03.166
scaring your opponent

16:03.266 --> 16:05.967
with a very intimidating face

16:03.266 --> 16:05.967
right before you battle.

16:06.066 --> 16:08.400
Now, I usually go

16:06.066 --> 16:08.400

16:18.100 --> 16:19.166
[ding]

16:19.266 --> 16:21.100
All right, DJ,

16:19.266 --> 16:21.100
this is who I got for you.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.000
It's a battle

16:21.200 --> 16:23.000
between two loving dads

16:23.100 --> 16:25.433
who have followed their

16:23.100 --> 16:25.433
passions their whole lives.

16:25.533 --> 16:29.166
One's a former football player

16:25.533 --> 16:29.166
turned yogi master.

16:29.266 --> 16:30.934
The other is

16:29.266 --> 16:30.934
a successful barber

16:31.033 --> 16:34.433

16:31.033 --> 16:34.433

16:39.066 --> 16:42.600

<i>Then, he traded in his board</i>

16:57.667 --> 17:00.266
<i>the night of my grand opening,</i>

17:00.367 --> 17:02.633
<i>but it was, like,</i>

17:00.367 --> 17:02.633
<i>the best feeling in the world.</i>

17:03.867 --> 17:08.166
<i>It's been five years now,</i>

17:03.867 --> 17:08.166
<i>and I currently own three.</i>

17:08.266 --> 17:10.767
<i>But I am a self-made man,</i>

17:08.266 --> 17:10.767
<i>and I'm very prideful</i>

17:10.867 --> 17:13.333
<i>of the fact that I did it</i>

17:10.867 --> 17:13.333
<i>all on my own.</i>

17:14.300 --> 17:15.867
<i>Day-to-day,</i>

17:14.300 --> 17:15.867

<i>You know, I have a fiancée.</i>

17:32.800 --> 17:34.900
But I could never do the right.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.533
<i>I'd just always do the left.</i>

17:38.166 --> 17:40.767
<i>I want to be on Dwayne's team,</i>

17:38.166 --> 17:40.767
<i>because I feel I'm worthy.</i>

17:40.867 --> 17:42.700
<i>I feel I'm ready.</i>

17:40.867 --> 17:42.700
<i>I've had to put in</i>

<i>as a weapon.</i>

17:59.834 --> 18:02.300
<i>But since he retired,</i>

17:59.834 --> 18:02.300
<i>he's opted</i>

18:02.400 --> 18:04.900
<i>for a less violent</i>

<i>line of work.</i>

18:05.033 --> 18:07.367
[soft music]

18:07.467 --> 18:10.800
Starting yoga, I was fresh

18:07.467 --> 18:10.800
off the football field,

18:10.900 --> 18:12.166
and I was stiff as a board.

18:12.266 --> 18:14.066
<i>I don't think people</i>

18:12.266 --> 18:14.066
<i>look at yogis as top athletes</i>

18:14.166 --> 18:15.767
<i>until they step foot</i>

18:14.166 --> 18:15.767
<i>into a yoga class</i>

18:15.867 --> 18:18.867
<i>and realize how much strength,</i>

18:15.867 --> 18:18.867
<i>how much focus it takes.</i>

18:18.967 --> 18:20.500
So I fell in love with the--

18:20.600 --> 18:23.867
the spiritual and mental side

18:20.600 --> 18:23.867
pretty quickly.

[Cari]<i> The tranquility</i>

18:29.567 --> 18:31.667
No, you got to hold my ankles.

<i>I have a daughter.</i>

18:32.867 --> 18:34.667

18:32.867 --> 18:34.667
<i>She's nine.</i>

18:34.767 --> 18:36.533
I call her my dove,

18:34.767 --> 18:36.533
because that's where

18:36.633 --> 18:38.667
I found peace and hope.

18:38.767 --> 18:42.600
She keeps me on my toes

18:38.767 --> 18:42.600
and helps me stay good at math.

18:42.700 --> 18:44.233

18:44.333 --> 18:46.667
<i>And she forces me to be</i>

18:53.266 --> 18:56.100

18:56.200 --> 18:58.934
<i>I'm not what you would think of</i>

18:56.200 --> 18:58.934

<i>when you see an NFL player.</i>

19:00.433 --> 19:02.800
<i>I surprise people when I say</i>

19:00.433 --> 19:02.800
<i>both of those things.</i>

19:02.900 --> 19:04.967
So I'm always underestimated,

19:02.900 --> 19:04.967
and I love it.

19:05.066 --> 19:08.400
I come with everything--

19:05.066 --> 19:08.400
resilience, athleticism, speed,

19:08.500 --> 19:11.400
strength, flexibility, focus.

19:28.100 --> 19:31.166
[Alex]<i> Liam, I think it's time</i>

19:28.100 --> 19:31.166
<i>to break out the toaster,</i>

19:31.266 --> 19:35.166

19:40.400 --> 19:44.066
<i>a 25-foot chain tower.</i>

19:45.200 --> 19:47.166
[Liam]<i> The key is to find</i>

19:45.200 --> 19:47.166
<i>a fluid motion</i>

19:47.266 --> 19:49.100
<i>that efficiently</i>

19:47.266 --> 19:49.100
<i>transfers energy</i>

19:49.200 --> 19:51.667
<i>from your legs</i>

19:49.200 --> 19:51.667
<i>to your upper body.</i>

20:06.333 --> 20:08.934
When people ask me

20:06.333 --> 20:08.934
what exactly does it mean

20:09.033 --> 20:10.033
to be a Titan,

20:10.133 --> 20:12.834
well, it means a desire

20:10.133 --> 20:12.834
to climb higher,

20:12.934 --> 20:15.600
to push through your limits

20:12.934 --> 20:15.600
and to reach a next level

20:15.700 --> 20:17.066
you didn't know existed.

20:17.166 --> 20:21.900
So, DJ and Angel, what does it

20:17.166 --> 20:21.900
mean to you to be a Titan?

20:22.000 --> 20:25.367
Well, myself and the world,

20:22.000 --> 20:25.367

27:06.734 --> 27:08.700
<i>Yes, she does get the hook.</i>

27:08.800 --> 27:10.967
<i>She needs a couple more</i>

27:08.800 --> 27:10.967
<i>long throws like that</i>

27:11.066 --> 27:12.600
<i>to catch up with Alma.</i>

27:12.700 --> 27:15.767
[Liam]<i> Alma has the lead.</i>

27:12.700 --> 27:15.767
<i>If she can maintain it,</i>

27:15.867 --> 27:17.667
<i>she's headed to Mount Olympus.</i>

27:32.667 --> 27:33.900
<i>And she does it!</i>

28:20.867 --> 28:21.934
-I love you.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.467
You did so good.

28:23.567 --> 28:25.800
There's a lot of kissing

28:23.567 --> 28:25.800
going on over there.

28:25.900 --> 28:27.667
[Alex]<i> They are</i>

for tonight's winners

to go head-to-head

28:44.800 --> 28:47.867
on the mountain of madness.

28:47.967 --> 28:50.967
The funhouse of physicality,

28:47.967 --> 28:50.967
Mount Olympus.

28:51.066 --> 28:53.800
It's truly

28:51.066 --> 28:53.800
the ultimate battleground.

28:53.900 --> 28:59.734
Now, Ashley Hawkins, a cop,

28:53.900 --> 28:59.734
and Alma Dwumfour, a nurse,

28:59.834 --> 29:01.867
have professions that would

28:59.834 --> 29:01.867
normally work in unison,

29:01.967 --> 29:03.433
but tonight,

29:01.967 --> 29:03.433
they're battling it out.

[dramatic music]

29:05.200 --> 29:06.934
<i>Having a career</i>

29:05.200 --> 29:06.934

29:07.033 --> 29:09.633

29:07.033 --> 29:09.633
be prepared for the unknown.

29:09.734 --> 29:11.734
[Liam]<i> Look at Ashley,</i>

29:11.834 --> 29:14.266
<i>That's how I'm going to</i>

29:11.834 --> 29:14.266
<i>conquer Mount Olympus.</i>

29:14.367 --> 29:18.133
-[Alex]<i> So much power!</i>

29:14.367 --> 29:18.133
<i>-I'm just ready for anything.</i>

29:18.233 --> 29:22.934
My edge going into Mount

29:26.800 --> 29:28.500

29:26.800 --> 29:28.500
<i>-It feels incredible</i>

<i>to have my husband</i>

<i>He inspires me every day.</i>

29:31.967 --> 29:34.467
<i>He makes me feel like</i>

29:31.967 --> 29:34.467
<i>I can achieve anything.</i>

29:34.567 --> 29:35.600
In order to become a Titan,

29:35.700 --> 29:37.667
you have to let everything

29:35.700 --> 29:37.667
all out there,

29:37.767 --> 29:39.934
<i>so I can't hold anything</i>

29:37.767 --> 29:39.934
<i>back tonight for sure.</i>

29:43.400 --> 29:45.433
All right, we all have

29:43.400 --> 29:45.433
struggles that shape us,

29:45.533 --> 29:48.233
but it's moments like this

29:45.533 --> 29:48.233
that define us.

29:48.333 --> 29:50.467
Can you keep going

29:48.333 --> 29:50.467
when the climb is steep

29:50.567 --> 29:52.033
and the floor below you

29:50.567 --> 29:52.033
is unsteady?

29:52.133 --> 29:56.100
Ashley, Alma, you're already

29:52.133 --> 29:56.100
inspiring all those around you.

29:56.200 --> 29:57.900
You've inspired

29:56.200 --> 29:57.900
millions tonight.

29:58.000 --> 29:59.200
Now, with the world watching,

29:59.300 --> 30:02.600
it's time to unleash

29:59.300 --> 30:02.600

33:56.166 --> 33:57.667
[Liam]<i> It's not</i>

[cheers and applause]

34:30.900 --> 34:33.333
You know it's okay.

34:30.900 --> 34:33.333
You did it.

34:33.433 --> 34:36.567
You did so good.

34:33.433 --> 34:36.567
I'm so happy.

34:39.433 --> 34:41.900
Here you go. Congratulations.

34:42.000 --> 34:43.333
To you and

34:48.834 --> 34:51.200
We'll be right back

34:48.834 --> 34:51.200

34:51.300 --> 34:52.867
Amazing.

34:54.033 --> 34:56.934
[dramatic music]

34:58.266 --> 35:00.967
Now two powerhouse athletes

34:58.266 --> 35:00.967
are about to face off

35:01.066 --> 35:03.433
for their shot at Titan glory.

35:03.533 --> 35:06.200
They proved what they're

35:03.533 --> 35:06.200
capable of earlier tonight.

35:06.300 --> 35:08.367
Now the yogi, DJ Townsel,

35:08.467 --> 35:12.400
and the Air National Guardsman,

35:08.467 --> 35:12.400
Matt Cable, go head-to-head.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.133
[dramatic music]

35:14.233 --> 35:16.467
<i>Definitely a time</i>

35:14.233 --> 35:16.467
<i>when I had leukemia,</i>

35:16.567 --> 35:19.367
that I thought that

35:16.567 --> 35:19.367
I may not ever be able

35:19.467 --> 35:21.066
to do anything like

35:19.467 --> 35:21.066
The Titan Games.

35:21.166 --> 35:23.867
[Alex]<i> Matt Cable is a tank.</i>

35:23.967 --> 35:25.100
I'm so grateful to be alive,

35:25.200 --> 35:26.967
<i>and I won't let anything</i>

35:25.200 --> 35:26.967
<i>stand in my path.</i>

35:27.066 --> 35:29.533
<i>Everybody thinks about yoga,</i>

35:27.066 --> 35:29.533
<i>that it's sitting down,</i>

35:29.633 --> 35:30.867
<i>stretching in a room</i>

35:29.633 --> 35:30.867
<i>full of incense.</i>

35:30.967 --> 35:34.100
[Alex]<i> A master yogi</i>

35:30.967 --> 35:34.100
<i>is your winner.</i>

35:34.200 --> 35:35.533
<i>It takes mind, body,</i>

35:34.200 --> 35:35.533
<i>and spirit,</i>

35:35.633 --> 35:37.367
and that's everything

35:35.633 --> 35:37.367
that I'm going to show

35:37.467 --> 35:38.633
out here on Mount Olympus.

35:38.734 --> 35:39.967
<i>Everything I have</i>

35:38.734 --> 35:39.967
<i>is going to be out there.</i>

35:40.066 --> 35:41.867
[Alex]<i> And we take</i>

35:40.066 --> 35:41.867
<i>a deep cleansing breath,</i>

35:41.967 --> 35:43.300
<i>-and say--</i>

35:41.967 --> 35:43.300
<i>-Namaste.</i>

35:47.533 --> 35:50.300
Now, these two are more

35:47.533 --> 35:50.300
than worthy competitors,

35:50.400 --> 35:52.333
but only one of them

35:50.400 --> 35:52.333
can be a Titan.

35:52.433 --> 35:55.166
DJ, your speed and agility

35:52.433 --> 35:55.166
brought you victory tonight.

35:55.266 --> 35:57.834
Matt, you showed the world

35:55.266 --> 35:57.834
how strong you are.

35:57.934 --> 36:00.767
You both lived life by not

35:57.934 --> 36:00.767
backing down from anything.

36:00.867 --> 36:02.300
This will be no different.

36:02.400 --> 36:04.467
As always,

36:02.400 --> 36:04.467
it's time to get to work.

36:04.567 --> 36:06.433
This is Mount Olympus.

36:14.333 --> 36:17.000
[Alex]<i> He's going to need it,</i>

36:14.333 --> 36:17.000
<i>especially against Matt Cable,</i>

<i>the 1,000-pound wall.</i>

<i>-But DJ's right behind.</i>

36:19.200 --> 36:22.066

36:22.166 --> 36:23.667
<i>Matt's 35 pounds heavier,</i>

36:26.767 --> 36:28.133
[Liam]<i> Remember, DJ, he said</i>

36:28.233 --> 36:29.834
<i>"I'm overlooked</i>

36:28.233 --> 36:29.834
<i>because I'm a yogi,</i>

<i>but I have that</i>

<i>to get up there.</i>

36:38.734 --> 36:39.900
[Liam]<i> You know what that was?</i>

36:40.000 --> 36:41.967
<i>That's a guy</i>

36:40.000 --> 36:41.967
<i>who runs a 4.4 40.</i>

36:42.066 --> 36:43.567
<i>Already at The Cliffs.</i>
