Any chance
we will find
the cargo intact?

00:16.510 --> 00:19.172
That would take
incredible luck.

00:19.220 --> 00:22.280
And the only time I have
ever been lucky in Alaska

00:22.320 --> 00:24.743
was when I was bumped
from behind

00:24.790 --> 00:26.758
at an ice bar in Fairbanks.

00:26.790 --> 00:30.851
I stumbled into_ the_arms
of a lovely NOl‘dlC princess.

00:30.890 --> 00:33.051
Literally, she was
a princess in Norway.

00:33.100 --> 00:35.022
We flew straight to her

00:35.060 --> 00:37.665

her husband's dead,

01:39.400 --> 01:41.027
she stands to
inherit millions.

01:41.060 --> 01:43.528
The way you described
her husband's condition,

01:43.570 --> 01:45.629
it sounds more like
a mercy killing.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.228
Maybe, but he didn't have
a medical directive,

01:47.270 --> 01:50.262
and she couldn't have
know what was going
on inside of his head.

01:50.310 --> 01:54.633
You mean like _
dreams and memories.

01:54.680 --> 01:57.376
Maybe even
a deep and abiding love

01:57.410 --> 01:59.549
for his betrothed.

01:59.580 --> 02:01.411
Exactly.
A love so deep

02:01.450 --> 02:05.409
that he would have preferred
that Elodie end his life

02:05.450 --> 02:08.248
so that she could
move on with hers.

killed her husband.

02:30.110 --> 02:31.805

Reddington's help?

02:31.850 --> 02:35.672

from the body
before it's buried,

02:35.720 --> 02:38.439
and I'll have it tested,
no questions asked.

have been stolen.

has gone missing.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.347
You want us

03:06.380 --> 03:08.348
I found the trucks.

03:08.380 --> 03:12.089
Sunk in a lake
in the Alaska Triangle.

03:12.120 --> 03:13.985
Wait, the Triangle's real?

03:14.020 --> 03:15.954
I don't want you

ARAM: This is former
US. House Majority
Leader Hale Boggs.

03:43.090 --> 03:46.139
Now, in 1972,
his twin-engine
Cessna vanished

03:46.190 --> 03:48.317

Juneau and Anchorage.

03:48.360 --> 03:50.351
The nation's largest
search-and-rescue mission

03:50.390 --> 03:53.291
was mounted. The Coast Guard,
Civil Air Patrol, the Naw.

03:53.330 --> 03:54.729
All scoured the area
for months,

03:54.760 --> 03:56.728
but no trace of Boggs' plane
was ever found.

03:56.770 --> 03:58.726
He was lost
in a section of the state

03:58.770 --> 04:00.863
known as
the Alaska Triangle.

04:00.900 --> 04:02.367
Like the
Bermuda Triangle?

04:02.410 --> 04:04.435
Yes, only real.
What's real about it

04:04.470 --> 04:06.438
is that an unusually large
number of people

04:06.480 --> 04:07.777
do seem to disappear there.

04:07.810 --> 04:09.539
And this connects
to Reddington how?

04:09.580 --> 04:12.378
Four months ago,
he lost a shipment
in the triangle.

04:12.420 --> 04:17.210
He attached a GPS
tracker to the next one
and found it here.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.608
may be behind
the Alaska Triangle myth.

04:20.660 --> 04:21.718
What was on the truck?

04:21.760 --> 04:23.557
He wouldn't say,
but some of it

04:23.590 --> 04:25.319
has apparently
shown up in Italy.

04:25.360 --> 04:26.725
He's on his way
to find out how.

04:26.760 --> 04:27.954
What about the drivers?

04:28.000 --> 04:29.695
Mr. Reddington thinks
they went down
with the shipment.

04:29.730 --> 04:31.561
COOPER: Do we have any leads?
ARAM: The container numbers.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.761
They're marked on
the roof for the benefit
of crane operators,

04:33.800 --> 04:35.961

from the photos.

04:36.000 --> 04:37.706
Based on those numbers,

04:37.740 --> 04:39.264
do we know where the cargo

04:39.310 --> 04:40.777

he waS selected
for the challenge.

33:11.750 --> 33:13.615
He came to the house...
Selected to die.

33:13.650 --> 33:15.459
He wanted money.

33:15.490 --> 33:16.787
He said he would
tell these lies

33:16.820 --> 33:17.912
if I didn't
give it to him.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.757
But Charles didn't die.

33:19.790 --> 33:20.950
And then I showed up.

33:20.990 --> 33:22.821
When we insisted
you go to The Defiance,

33:22.860 --> 33:24.999
you got Eaton to pick you.

33:27.470 --> 33:29.290
I thought I was
saving you,

33:31.310 --> 33:32.800
but you two had
worked out a way

33:32.840 --> 33:34.171
for you to save yourself.

33:34.810 --> 33:36.277
No.

33:36.310 --> 33:37.777
I would have died
without you.

33:37.810 --> 33:40.404
No. You used me.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.442
You got me
to open up to you.

33:44.490 --> 33:46.617
That'S why you kept asking
about Blacklisters.

33:47.990 --> 33:51.221
_ _ To seduce me into
givmg you a murder weapon.

33:52.060 --> 33:54.028
You can't believe that.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.246
I can't believe you would
take his word over mine.

34:11.280 --> 34:12.406
Your word, then...

34:13.810 --> 34:15.243
Did you kill him?

34:18.390 --> 34:19.539
I love you.

34:22.190 --> 34:23.589
Did you kill Charles?

34:27.260 --> 34:28.454
No.

REDDINGTON: Agent Park.

34:46.380 --> 34:48.519
You kidnapped Lussier.

34:48.550 --> 34:50.768
They found him inside
your truck, didn't they?

34:51.890 --> 34:54.256
We can discuss that
over Shiozake.

34:54.290 --> 34:57.680
You orchestrated
this whole thing.
You put us together.

34:57.720 --> 35:01.087
I intended on bringing
you together, yes,

35:01.130 --> 35:04.361
by abducting him,
not you.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.721
That was unforeseen.

35:06.770 --> 35:08.761
But in the end,

35:08.800 --> 35:10.392
it served the greater good.

35:12.440 --> 35:15.375
You have no business
interfering in my life.

35:15.410 --> 35:18.345
I do when
your life interferes
with my business.

35:20.780 --> 35:22.247
I know about your mother

35:22.280 --> 35:25.613
and her relationship
with Mr. Lussier.

35:26.650 --> 35:27.844
How could you know that?

35:27.890 --> 35:29.118
Because I must.

35:31.590 --> 35:36.596
You're an excellent agent,
Alina, and a loose cannon.

35:36.630 --> 35:39.861
I need the first,
and I won't tolerate
the second.

35:39.900 --> 35:42.960
So you put us together
so I could, what?

35:43.000 --> 35:46.663
Exact my revenge
and become less
uncontrollable?

35:47.810 --> 35:51.974
My world is filled
with people seeking revenge.

35:53.010 --> 35:54.773
_I can see it
every time I look at them.

35:54.820 --> 35:56.913
It's as distinct
as a birthmark.

35:58.520 --> 36:03.617
But I look at you
and see none of that.

36:03.660 --> 36:06.652
I don't see
a quest for vengeance.

36:07.790 --> 36:11.965
I see a smart,
capable young woman

36:12.000 --> 36:14.161
filled with self-loathing,

36:15.170 --> 36:16.694
and I think

36:16.740 --> 36:18.662
if you have
a debt to settle,

36:20.810 --> 36:22.573
perhaps it's
with yourself.

36:25.880 --> 36:28.371
Lussier's an addict
who supports his habit

36:28.420 --> 36:29.819
through armed robbery
and theft.

36:31.320 --> 36:33.311
when I gave everything I knew
about his crimes

36:33.350 --> 36:34.988
to the Alaska bureau.

36:36.690 --> 36:38.282
And the debt
you owe yourself?

36:45.230 --> 36:47.095
(SIGHS)

36:47.130 --> 36:49.098
I settled that
by giving them nothing

36:49.140 --> 36:50.596
about what he did
to my mother.

36:52.670 --> 36:53.830
Because he...

36:55.440 --> 36:56.771
Did nothing.

36:58.550 --> 36:59.744
The heroin did.

37:02.150 --> 37:04.687
They were addicts,
and they were helpless
to help each other.

37:06.090 --> 37:07.341
I was helpless, too.

37:09.190 --> 37:10.452
You were a child.

37:11.460 --> 37:13.553
You couldn't be
expected to help.

37:14.860 --> 37:16.521
You shouldn't
hate yourself for that.

37:18.730 --> 37:22.530
After he left,
she was shaking

37:22.570 --> 37:24.709
and vomiting
and doubled over in pain.

37:27.110 --> 37:28.372
I was seven.

37:29.480 --> 37:31.698
All I saw
was that she was in pain,

37:34.110 --> 37:35.247

Sweetie, I'm begging.

37:35.820 --> 37:37.674

37:45.060 --> 37:49.258
At first,
she was so...happy.

37:52.470 --> 37:55.359
The pain just disappeared.

37:57.570 --> 38:00.607
And then her eyes rolled back
into her head, and...

38:02.810 --> 38:04.107
She died.

38:05.810 --> 38:07.004
She overdosed.

38:08.320 --> 38:09.912
I overdosed her.

38:09.950 --> 38:11.747
(CRYING)

38:16.090 --> 38:18.752
I don't hate myself because
I couldn't help my mom.

38:21.930 --> 38:25.263
I hate myself
because I killed her.

and my past there.

I've read your file.
I know things
got a little bumpy

39:26.530 --> 39:27.588
near the end.

39:27.630 --> 39:30.519
Bumpy would be a gracious
choice of words.

Sir, there are things
that happened in Anchorage,

39:35.370 --> 39:37.565

that you're not aware of.

all he was promised,

to prison for the
rest of his life.

about Anchorage.

40:22.680 --> 40:25.080
She told me you know.
I'm curious aS to why

40:25.120 --> 40:27.441
you didn't feel the need
to say anything to me.

40:28.250 --> 40:29.683
I didn't say anything

40:29.720 --> 40:31.859
because I don't think
you should do anything.

40:32.890 --> 40:34.892
She didn't just bend
the rule book. She broke it.

40:34.930 --> 40:36.249
