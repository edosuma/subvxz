PRIEST: We are gathered here today

01:10.400 --> 01:13.087
I hope you're enjoying
your last day as my fiancée,

01:13.112 --> 01:14.937
because by this time tomorrow,

01:14.971 --> 01:16.876
you're gonna be my straight-up wife.

01:19.101 --> 01:20.602
Uh, you doing okay?

01:20.889 --> 01:22.704
Of course. Yeah... why?

01:22.729 --> 01:24.087
Oh, no reason.

01:24.180 --> 01:25.790
You know, just doing
this whole big wedding thing

01:25.815 --> 01:27.493
without your dad's gonna
be hard, and we're here

01:27.518 --> 01:29.626
at the family cabin,
which is probably bringing up

01:29.651 --> 01:31.852
a lot of memories... please
don't <i>Runaway Bride</i> me.

01:32.689 --> 01:34.954
- (QUIETLY): Please don't <i>Runaway Bride...</i>
- Toby. I would never.

01:36.483 --> 01:37.571
But will you come with me?

01:37.596 --> 01:39.275
- I have a surprise for you.
- Ooh.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.001
- KATE: Uh-huh.
- I like surprises.

01:44.629 --> 01:45.868
This is for you.

01:48.423 --> 01:49.602
Oh, look.

01:49.941 --> 01:51.540
It's a used bow tie.

01:51.567 --> 01:53.902
Oh, not just any used bow tie.

01:54.259 --> 01:55.860
This was worn by Leslie Nielsen

01:55.894 --> 01:57.759
in <i>Naked Gun 33 1/3: Final Insult.</i>

01:57.831 --> 02:00.969
- So.
- Shut your freaking face.

02:01.305 --> 02:02.733
- (LAUGHS)
- Leslie Nielsen wore this?

02:02.768 --> 02:03.790
Yeah.

02:03.815 --> 02:05.344
I just wanted to thank you.

02:05.369 --> 02:09.798
You've gone out of your way
to make this my dream wedding.

02:10.524 --> 02:13.837
You know, just one beautiful day
at my favorite place.

02:13.862 --> 02:16.256
And I know that my choices
are kind of...

02:16.281 --> 02:17.321
(SIGHS) they're weird.

02:17.469 --> 02:19.516
I know it's not normal
to have my dad's urn

02:19.541 --> 02:20.868
next to our guestbook.

02:21.126 --> 02:23.266
It's a fun twist on the sign-in station.

02:23.291 --> 02:25.446
Okay, and to have
his Daytona Beach T-shirt

02:25.471 --> 02:26.477
as my something old.

02:26.502 --> 02:28.516
- It's weird, and I know.
- Listen, if my boo comes

02:28.541 --> 02:30.852
with baggage, I'm paying
the handling fee.

02:30.940 --> 02:33.477
- Mm, I love your airline metaphors.
- Well, that's good,

02:33.502 --> 02:35.259
- 'cause I'm cleared for takeoff.
- Oh...

02:35.313 --> 02:36.704
- KEVIN: Yes. Everyone. Okay?
- Aw, damn it.

02:36.729 --> 02:38.821
Everyone gets a Ka-Toby wine opener,

02:38.846 --> 02:40.618
they get a bottle
of champagne and they get

02:40.643 --> 02:42.678
a scented candle, now,
why are you just now starting

02:42.703 --> 02:44.665
with the gift bags?
No, no, no. Hold on, hold on.

02:44.690 --> 02:46.555
Don't justify it, fix it.

02:47.896 --> 02:50.290
Okay. Yeah, I'll see you
tonight, Randall. Okay.

02:52.025 --> 02:53.282
- Wow.
- No, it's fine.

02:53.301 --> 02:55.135
It's fine. Don't worry about it.
Randall and I, we have

02:55.169 --> 02:57.476
this whole, uh, wedding planner
thing all figured out.

02:57.501 --> 02:59.305
You do not have to lift a finger.

03:00.134 --> 03:02.269
Toby, you should be getting
to the airport, all right?

03:02.303 --> 03:03.462
- Your mom gets in at 5:28,
- Oh, yeah.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.821
- your dad gets in at 5:46.
- Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

03:05.846 --> 03:07.899
T-this car ride is gonna be
a nightmare, by the way.

03:07.924 --> 03:10.305
My-my parents, whenever they're
together, all they do is fight.

03:10.330 --> 03:13.540
My dad's constantly pressuring
my mom to marry her boyfriend.

03:14.540 --> 03:15.766
If she marries Monty,

03:15.791 --> 03:17.518
then my dad doesn't
have to pay alimony anymore.

03:17.543 --> 03:19.040
- It's a whole thing.
- Ah.

03:20.876 --> 03:22.188
Okay, I think he wants you to go, babe.

03:22.213 --> 03:23.376
- I think he wants me to leave.
- Yeah.

03:23.401 --> 03:25.517
All right, well,
I'll see you later. Mwah.

03:25.551 --> 03:28.079
I'll see you tomorrow,
at the end of the aisle.

03:28.104 --> 03:29.266
- Thanks for this.
- (KEVIN LAUGHS)

03:29.945 --> 03:31.079
KEVIN: Be safe.

03:37.306 --> 03:39.040
KEVIN: <i>Uh, I'm gonna go
check on these caterers.</i>

03:39.065 --> 03:40.618
Some of these clowns
wouldn't know an amuse-bouche

03:40.643 --> 03:41.759
if it bit them on the ass.

03:41.909 --> 03:43.149
Hey, Kev?

03:43.850 --> 03:45.150
- Yeah.
- Do you think

03:45.175 --> 03:46.743
that, like, Dad would've been okay...

03:47.484 --> 03:49.243
you know, us having it here?

03:50.471 --> 03:51.634
At the cabin?

03:52.084 --> 03:53.126
Yeah.

03:53.710 --> 03:54.930
Dad would've loved it.

04:02.765 --> 04:04.087
(SHUFFLING, CLINKING)

04:06.423 --> 04:07.774
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

04:07.799 --> 04:10.235
Hey, babe. You about ready
to head up to the cabin?

04:10.260 --> 04:11.376
Almost done.

04:11.580 --> 04:13.907
Going as fast as I can.

04:14.833 --> 04:16.540
Got two bottles in one bag.

04:16.565 --> 04:18.188
Get your head out of your ass, Pearson.

04:18.613 --> 04:19.748
You okay?

04:20.009 --> 04:22.407
Just scrambling
to get this done for Kate.

04:22.763 --> 04:24.368
Things have been
a little hectic around here.

04:24.393 --> 04:25.688
Haven't had much time.

04:26.126 --> 04:27.399
Hey, Dej.

04:27.424 --> 04:29.149
You excited about this weekend?

04:30.004 --> 04:31.954
I can't wait for you
to meet my cousin Zoe.

04:31.969 --> 04:34.430
She's gonna take Kate and
Toby's wedding photos.

04:34.579 --> 04:35.641
Yeah, she's the cool one.

04:35.666 --> 04:37.340
In my family, she's the cool one.

04:37.375 --> 04:39.829
Can you believe that I'm not
the cool one in my fa... Okay.

04:39.863 --> 04:41.287
Hey, are you all packed?
We're gonna be leaving

04:41.312 --> 04:42.485
as soon as I finish with these bags.

04:42.510 --> 04:43.626
DEJA: I can't believe we're going

04:43.651 --> 04:45.462
to some dumbass wedding in the woods.

04:48.252 --> 04:49.540
Man, she's mean.

04:50.009 --> 04:51.485
I miss Deja Classic.

04:52.227 --> 04:53.274
No.

04:53.299 --> 04:54.800
Deja Classic was when we first met her,

04:54.825 --> 04:56.430
and she was all quiet and sullen.

04:56.455 --> 05:00.094
I miss Deja 2.0, when she was
all used to us and sweet,

05:00.119 --> 05:01.594
and she told me all my jokes were corny,

05:01.619 --> 05:02.821
but secretly, she liked them.

05:02.906 --> 05:06.808
I feel like the moment she heard
her mom say to the judge

05:06.833 --> 05:09.360
that she wanted to terminate
all parental rights,

05:09.385 --> 05:10.759
something switched in her.

05:10.917 --> 05:12.009
Yep.

05:12.034 --> 05:14.415
Okay. Let's grab the girls and head out.

05:17.231 --> 05:18.454
Uh, wait. Wait.

05:19.703 --> 05:21.048
Can we just do our thing?

05:21.423 --> 05:22.957
Where we say all the bad things

05:22.991 --> 05:24.999
that we're thinking;
no judgment, no censorship?

05:25.024 --> 05:26.446
You want to play
worst-case scenario now?

05:26.471 --> 05:28.126
I just got to get it out of my system.

05:28.493 --> 05:29.579
All right, let's do it.

05:29.614 --> 05:30.712
(EXHALES)

05:31.688 --> 05:34.251
Deja never turns this around
and ends up in jail. Go.

05:34.622 --> 05:36.516
She might kill us both in our sleep. Go.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.555
She might kill us both
not in our sleep. Go.

05:39.679 --> 05:42.247
She'll make Tess resent us
and end up on the pole. Go.

05:42.790 --> 05:44.954
Wait, Tess will resent us, and
Deja will end up on the pole?

05:44.979 --> 05:47.079
Or Tess will resent us,
and also be the one who ends up

05:47.104 --> 05:48.634
- on the pole?
- Both on the pole.

05:48.766 --> 05:49.900
Damn.

05:50.876 --> 05:52.204
Out of your system now?

05:52.673 --> 05:53.719
Yeah.

05:54.456 --> 05:55.782
- Okay.
- Yeah, thanks.

05:56.641 --> 05:58.313
Oh. That's really pretty.

05:58.554 --> 06:00.696
Mm. Nah.

06:01.282 --> 06:03.563
(SIGHING): It's just...
feels a little flashy.

06:03.588 --> 06:05.938
I just-I don't want to do
anything to make Kate feel

06:05.963 --> 06:08.165
like I'm gonna make tomorrow about me.

06:08.190 --> 06:10.313
Wha... Now, why would she think that?

06:11.219 --> 06:15.016
Because I put her on edge
by the things I do or say

06:15.041 --> 06:18.501
or don't say or... the way I breathe.

06:18.651 --> 06:19.844
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

06:20.787 --> 06:22.532
But tomorrow's her wedding day,

06:22.934 --> 06:26.102
and I just feel like I am this
walking reminder of Jack.

06:26.661 --> 06:28.305
You know, he's the one that she lost,

06:28.330 --> 06:31.098
and I'm the one that she got stuck with.

06:31.438 --> 06:34.032
Well, I don't think that's true.

06:34.733 --> 06:37.844
And if it helps, just remember:
at least you're not me.

06:37.869 --> 06:38.907
(LAUGHS SOFTLY)

06:39.207 --> 06:40.704
What's that supposed to mean?

06:40.729 --> 06:42.079
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Yeah.

06:42.104 --> 06:44.798
Well, if anyone is a walking
reminder of Jack, it's me.

06:45.299 --> 06:46.469
Forget about what you're wearing.

06:46.494 --> 06:48.266
If I could dress in all brown tomorrow

06:48.291 --> 06:49.423
and pretend to be a tree, I would.

06:49.704 --> 06:51.471
- (LAUGHS) Stop.
- Just throw acorns at people.

06:52.200 --> 06:53.258
Miguel.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.149
Welcome to wedding central.

07:05.736 --> 07:07.477
Where is everybody?
Where's Beth, the girls?

07:07.608 --> 07:08.875
I dropped them at the hotel.

07:09.088 --> 07:10.118
It was a rough car ride.

07:10.143 --> 07:11.508
- Really? Deja?
- Yeah.

07:11.954 --> 07:12.985
She's belligerent.

07:13.010 --> 07:14.410
It's like I'm raising Russell Crowe.

07:14.435 --> 07:15.414
- (LAUGHS)
- KATE: Kevin?

07:15.479 --> 07:17.258
- Kevin!
- Uh-oh.

07:18.084 --> 07:19.149
(GRUNTS)

07:21.258 --> 07:22.500
No. No.

07:22.525 --> 07:23.859
No. No, no, no, no, no.

07:24.088 --> 07:25.618
- Hey.
- What's up?

07:25.892 --> 07:28.594
- Um, hey, Randall.
- Okay, sis, what's up?

07:28.619 --> 07:29.786
- Oh, my God, oh, my God.
- You all right?

07:30.134 --> 07:32.352
Um, I can't find Dad's Daytona T-shirt.

07:32.377 --> 07:33.524
It was gonna be my something old,

07:33.549 --> 07:34.571
and I was gonna pin it in my dress.

07:34.596 --> 07:36.330
- Aw.
- Wow, that's really, uh...

07:36.586 --> 07:40.063
- Weird? I know I am weird, Randall!
- KEVIN: Ah, no, no, no.

07:40.088 --> 07:41.477
- "Unique." I was gonna say "unique."
- Hold up. Wait, wa...

07:41.502 --> 07:42.938
- Was what I thought.
- Kate. Kate.

07:43.249 --> 07:45.211
- What if Toby never packed it?
- You know what we're gonna do?

07:45.236 --> 07:46.907
- Just call Toby. We're gonna call Toby.
- Yeah. We...

07:46.932 --> 07:48.313
- It's a quick phone call. Quick fix.
- Yeah, yeah.

07:48.338 --> 07:49.664
- We'll...
- Do not...

07:50.412 --> 07:51.961
- tell him that I'm freaking out.
- Who's freaking out?

07:51.986 --> 07:54.008
- No.
- I do not want him to worry about me.

07:54.033 --> 07:55.336
It's a quick phone call. Yeah.

07:55.361 --> 07:56.422
(WHISTLES)

07:57.290 --> 07:59.562
ALAN: I'm just saying, you two
have been dating for a while

07:59.587 --> 08:02.218
now, so why don't you just marry
the poor bastard already?

08:02.243 --> 08:04.241
As I told you before, Alan,

08:04.266 --> 08:06.828
- Monty and I are taking it slow.
- Yeah, you mean

08:06.853 --> 08:09.213
like the way you're slowly
draining my retirement fund

08:09.238 --> 08:11.399
- with those alimony payments.
- TOBY: Okay, guys, it's, uh,

08:11.424 --> 08:13.719
it's my wedding weekend,
so can we go 48 hours

08:13.744 --> 08:15.094
- without talking about alimony?
- (PHONE RINGING)

08:15.344 --> 08:16.750
Hey, look, it's Kevin.

- Hey, Kev.
- KEVIN (OVER PHONE): <i>Toby.</i>

08:18.627 --> 08:20.071
<i>- 'Sup?
- 'Sup?</i>

08:20.950 --> 08:22.946
I got Randall here.
Randall wants to say 'sup.

08:24.418 --> 08:26.063
- 'Sup.
- 'Sup.

KEVIN: <i>We were just calling,
we wanted to know</i>

08:27.705 --> 08:28.852
if you could remember where you packed

08:28.877 --> 08:30.391
our dad's Daytona T-shirt.

08:32.696 --> 08:34.703
Oh, my God, did I forget
to pack the T-shirt?

08:34.727 --> 08:37.383
I totally forgot to pack the T-shirt.

08:37.741 --> 08:38.938
<i>Uh, uh, okay,</i>

08:38.962 --> 08:41.102
um, I can figure out
a way to get it. Uh, uh...

08:41.126 --> 08:42.836

- It's fine. Everything's fine.

- Really?</i>

08:44.945 --> 08:46.453

...it's no biggie.

08:57.352 --> 08:59.618
Hey, it sounds like
it's just a shirt, right?

08:59.643 --> 09:01.821
Yeah, well, it's not just a shirt, Ma.

09:06.091 --> 09:08.711
RANDALL: Okay. We'll round up
anything of Dad's we can find,

09:08.736 --> 09:10.813
and then, tomorrow morning,
you'll take your pick.

09:10.909 --> 09:12.000

And the reason we wanted to make
sure this day was absolutely perfect

36:16.304 --> 36:18.545
for you is because that's...

36:20.225 --> 36:21.514
that's what Dad would've done.

36:21.539 --> 36:23.006
He would've made it perfect for you.

36:24.959 --> 36:26.084
And, uh...

36:26.396 --> 36:27.436
If he were here,

36:27.461 --> 36:29.287
he definitely would've looked at you

36:30.198 --> 36:32.084
and he would've said, "Katie girl...

36:34.381 --> 36:35.631

you have never looked more beautiful...

36:43.772 --> 36:44.975
You're beautiful.

36:47.051 --> 36:50.725
Um... Mom, Randall,

36:50.750 --> 36:51.803
uh...

36:52.058 --> 36:55.029
earlier last year, Kate said
something to me that was,

36:55.465 --> 36:57.209
well, profound, uh...

36:58.286 --> 37:01.068
She said, "Kevin, if you
don't allow yourself to...

37:01.415 --> 37:03.146
to grieve Dad's death,

37:03.171 --> 37:06.053
it'll be like taking
a giant breath in and just...

37:06.853 --> 37:08.162
holding it there

37:09.508 --> 37:10.959
for the rest of your life."

37:13.235 --> 37:15.903
I... At the time, I didn't want
to hear any of that. You know...

37:16.623 --> 37:18.170
I... I didn't. Um...

37:18.195 --> 37:21.311
but here we are. It's one DUI
and a rehab stint later,

37:21.336 --> 37:24.071

you were on to something

37:25.009 --> 37:27.154
- when you said that to me, um...
- (LIGHT CHUCKLES)

37:28.490 --> 37:31.623

holding our breath

37:37.396 --> 37:38.597
before we clink our glasses,

37:38.622 --> 37:41.791
I think that the four of us should, uh,

37:41.874 --> 37:43.717
release that breath together.

37:45.804 --> 37:48.305
I think it's important that
we do that, that we just let go

37:48.330 --> 37:50.396
of those things we've
been holding onto, so...

37:51.817 --> 37:53.037
