WEBVTT

00:02.850 --> 00:03.670
Max.

00:03.790 --> 00:07.049
It's the woman at table 2's 50th birthday
and her husband wants us to sing to her.

00:07.283 --> 00:10.021
If I had a dollar every time a man
asked me to do something to his wife,

00:10.141 --> 00:11.181
I'd be a millionaire.

00:13.553 --> 00:16.248
I remember when
Happy Birthday first came up.

00:17.291 --> 00:18.756
I never thought it would catch on.

00:19.734 --> 00:20.800
Go!

00:20.920 --> 00:22.230
And smile.

00:22.350 --> 00:23.696
When you fake smile,

00:23.816 --> 00:25.641
everybody else fakes smile back.

00:28.208 --> 00:30.283
Nobody wants to hear that lame song.

00:30.403 --> 00:33.343
If we want to humiliate her in public, why
don't we go over there and pull her top down?

00:34.122 --> 00:36.519
Come on, let's just go sing
and make the best of it.

00:38.427 --> 00:40.258
Ready?

00:40.378 --> 00:41.906
One, two, three...

00:42.026 --> 00:47.974
# Happy birthday to you...#

00:48.267 --> 00:49.805
Whoa!

00:52.497 --> 00:53.962
I apologize.

00:54.082 --> 00:56.897
It's hard enough your husband took you
to a diner on your birthday

00:57.017 --> 00:58.690
and now you have to listen to white Mariah?

00:59.296 --> 01:00.101
No!

01:01.482 --> 01:03.251
Happy ***.

01:05.045 --> 01:10.886
# To yoooooooou #

01:27.418 --> 01:29.396
I have announcement to make.

01:29.398 --> 01:32.283
I agree with what Max said before.

01:32.285 --> 01:33.984
What? That we should tie
a little bell around you,

01:33.986 --> 01:40.624
so we know when you're near?

01:40.626 --> 01:42.343
The diner needs a fresh, new way

01:42.345 --> 01:44.328
to celebrate the customer birthday.

01:44.330 --> 01:47.598
So I just went
and wrote a special song.

01:47.600 --> 01:50.000
Han, I'd be happy to look
at what you've written so far.

01:50.002 --> 01:51.468
I took music theory in college.

01:51.470 --> 01:53.554
I once wrote
an entire original musical

01:53.556 --> 01:55.189
based on the French revolution.

01:55.191 --> 01:57.674
Um, sorry to step on your nerd turf,

01:57.676 --> 02:00.778
<i>but Les Mis is already a musical
about the French revolution.</i>

02:00.780 --> 02:04.114
Yes, but mine was from
the point of view of the rich.

02:04.116 --> 02:06.233
What are you going
to rewrite next--

02:06.235 --> 02:09.987
<i>the musical rent from the point
of view of the landlord?</i>

02:10.905 --> 02:13.624
Han, this is
a lovely start, but--

02:13.626 --> 02:14.992
A lovely start?

02:14.994 --> 02:16.410
No, I mean, it's good.

02:16.412 --> 02:17.578
But not good enough.

02:17.580 --> 02:18.879
I know what you are saying.

02:18.881 --> 02:20.864
"You need to practice more, Han.

02:20.866 --> 02:22.967
"You never will be
as good as your sister, Han.

02:22.969 --> 02:24.701
"Whole family going on vacation

02:24.703 --> 02:26.720
without you
while you practice, Han."

02:26.722 --> 02:28.839
Back off, tiger mom!

02:31.676 --> 02:33.260
Hey, Caroline, is Max around?

02:33.262 --> 02:36.413
Um, she might be.
I'll go check.

02:36.415 --> 02:39.767
You'll never guess who
just came into the restaurant.

02:39.769 --> 02:41.068
You'll be very happy.

02:41.070 --> 02:43.821
<i>Gary, the fat guy from teen mom?</i>

02:43.823 --> 02:46.073
Someone you like,
someone you want to kiss,

02:46.075 --> 02:47.358
someone you're hot for.

02:47.360 --> 02:50.110
<i>Tyler, the skinny guy from teen mom?</i>

02:51.396 --> 02:52.446
What's Johnny doing here?

02:52.448 --> 02:53.781
I told him not
to show his face unless--

02:53.783 --> 02:55.449
Unless he broke up
with his girlfriend.

02:55.451 --> 02:57.234
And now he's here, showing his face,

02:57.236 --> 02:59.286
- which means--
- You can't know that for sure.

02:59.288 --> 03:01.672
Fine. Tell me one other reason
he could possibly be in here.

03:01.674 --> 03:04.041
He needs Han to solve
a complex math problem?

03:04.043 --> 03:05.876
Max!

03:05.878 --> 03:08.178
Max, it's pretty obvious
that he's in here

03:08.180 --> 03:09.880
because he broke up
with his girlfriend "Cassandra"

03:09.882 --> 03:11.415
I mean, what else could it be?

03:11.417 --> 03:12.683
When I had millions of dollars,

03:12.685 --> 03:14.601
I had no idea
why guys were coming to see me.

03:14.603 --> 03:16.420
"Do they want me,
or do they want my money?"

03:16.422 --> 03:17.921
But you have nothing!

03:17.923 --> 03:20.357
So basically that just leaves you.

03:20.359 --> 03:22.926
Way to puff me up
before I go through that door.

03:22.928 --> 03:24.478
This is so exciting.

03:24.480 --> 03:27.597
Will you stop?
Don't be such a girl.

03:27.599 --> 03:29.900
Hair? Teeth? Anything?

03:29.902 --> 03:31.235
You're good.

03:31.237 --> 03:32.653
Wait.

03:35.407 --> 03:37.774
More.

03:38.776 --> 03:42.413
- Really?
- Trust me.

03:48.453 --> 03:51.305
Oh, uh, hey, Johnny.
When did you get here?

03:51.307 --> 03:52.506
Uh, just now.

03:52.508 --> 03:53.757
I, uh--I came here

03:53.759 --> 03:55.625
because I want to tell you something.

03:55.627 --> 03:58.128
Yes?

03:58.130 --> 04:01.482
Max, I think you and I
have something special.

04:01.484 --> 04:03.767
And I don't want to lose that.

04:03.769 --> 04:06.520
So I came down here to ask...

04:06.522 --> 04:08.572
Even though it didn't work out,

04:08.574 --> 04:09.857
can we still be friends?

04:09.859 --> 04:11.742
- Oh.
- What?

04:11.744 --> 04:14.328
You have got to be kidding!

04:14.330 --> 04:15.529
Oh.

04:15.531 --> 04:16.980
What's going on over there, Caroline?

04:16.982 --> 04:18.999
My friend Johnny and I have no idea

04:19.000 --> 04:20.367
what you're upset about.

04:20.369 --> 04:23.153
I was just reacting to the
news that we're out of pie.

04:23.155 --> 04:25.005
<i>I really cannot believe it.</i>

04:25.007 --> 04:27.374
I totally thought it would go
a different way.

04:27.376 --> 04:29.376
Caroline...

04:29.378 --> 04:32.096
Why don't you go over there
to the pie carrousel

04:32.098 --> 04:34.548
and mourn the loss of our pie?

04:36.334 --> 04:38.335
So, we're cool?

04:38.337 --> 04:40.137
Yeah, we're cool.
Why wouldn't we be?

04:40.139 --> 04:42.189
We never dated or anything like that.

04:42.191 --> 04:43.557
Of course we're friends.

04:43.559 --> 04:44.725
I am so relieved.

04:44.727 --> 04:46.777
So, uh, you gonna go back

04:46.779 --> 04:48.779
to busting my balls, like always?

04:48.781 --> 04:50.397
Yes.

04:50.399 --> 04:52.483
We're such good friends,
I might just...

04:52.485 --> 04:54.902
Bust them with my feet!

04:59.007 --> 05:00.374
Good morning.

05:00.376 --> 05:02.876
I'm trying to send out
a get-to-know-us email blast

05:02.878 --> 05:04.044
for the cupcake business.

05:04.046 --> 05:05.496
But your wi-fi is so slow.

05:05.498 --> 05:08.532
Don't tell me--
tell cathyhome17,

05:08.534 --> 05:10.217
whoever and wherever she is.

05:10.219 --> 05:11.335
Okay, well, I'm just going

05:11.337 --> 05:13.053
to run down to the coffee place
and send it.

05:13.055 --> 05:14.037
Do you approve?

05:14.039 --> 05:15.639
Nice job.
The font's pretty.

05:15.641 --> 05:17.724
You just gave me a compliment?

05:17.726 --> 05:19.092
I knew it--
you're depressed.

05:19.094 --> 05:20.644
You're so depressed

05:20.646 --> 05:21.929
about you and Johnny
just being friends,

05:21.931 --> 05:23.897
you don't even have the energy
to be you.

05:23.899 --> 05:25.399
What?
The font is pretty.

05:25.401 --> 05:27.818
Oh, honey, do you want a hug?

05:27.820 --> 05:30.654
- I'm fine.
- How could you be fine?

05:30.656 --> 05:32.022
The man was so into you,

05:32.024 --> 05:34.024
he painted a billboard
of the two of you kissing.

05:34.026 --> 05:35.559
And now he just wants to be friends?

05:35.561 --> 05:38.028
Please call in sick
to your babysitting job

05:38.030 --> 05:39.329
and take to the bed.

05:39.331 --> 05:40.697
Whenever I used to get depressed,

05:40.699 --> 05:41.748
I'd take to the bed.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.917
One time, I took to the bed
for a week.

05:43.919 --> 05:46.119
Listen, unlike you, Jane Austen,

05:46.121 --> 05:47.704
I will never take to the bed.

05:47.706 --> 05:50.240
Giving into feelings
is for rich people.

05:50.242 --> 05:51.792
Regular people just have to get up,

05:51.794 --> 05:55.712
get drunk, and go fulfill
their babysitting duties.

05:55.714 --> 05:57.914
Max, take to the bed.

05:57.916 --> 06:00.634
Look, this is my pattern, okay?

06:00.636 --> 06:02.019
I fall for the wrong guy,

06:02.021 --> 06:04.021
I find out they're with a girl,
a bottle, or a needle,

06:04.023 --> 06:05.222
and I move on.

06:05.224 --> 06:07.641
And sometimes I use a bottle
to help me do it...

06:07.643 --> 06:10.644
Or a needle or a girl.

06:12.113 --> 06:13.780
But when I'm done, I'm done.

06:13.782 --> 06:14.982
That's it?

06:14.984 --> 06:16.033
You're just over it?

06:16.035 --> 06:17.484
Wow.

06:17.486 --> 06:20.120
I'm still sad because
Kyle Enright didn't invite me

06:20.122 --> 06:23.290
on his private jet to Mykonos
for his 12th birthday.

06:23.292 --> 06:25.292
Well, not me.

06:25.294 --> 06:28.045
Just flip a switch
and those feelings are gone.

06:28.047 --> 06:29.913
I only have two switches
in my life--

06:29.915 --> 06:31.715
one turns off my emotions,

06:31.717 --> 06:34.418
the other makes a car bounce.

06:34.420 --> 06:36.503
Okay, I better go.

06:36.505 --> 06:39.389
If you get there after 10:30,
you can't hear yourself think

06:39.391 --> 06:43.927
over the sounds of people
skyping to the Philippines.

06:45.013 --> 06:47.964
Max, are you sure you're all right?

06:47.966 --> 06:49.182
Max.

06:49.184 --> 06:52.269
Are you about to come
over here and soft-touch me?

06:52.271 --> 06:54.688
- I want to so bad.
- Leave!

06:54.690 --> 06:57.741
Go to the coffee place.
Soft-touch the barista.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.167
Excuse me, miss.

07:07.169 --> 07:08.418
You keep your door open like that,

07:08.420 --> 07:10.787
this rat's probably
going to get inside.

07:10.789 --> 07:14.324
Don't worry. You should see
the size of my cat.

07:14.326 --> 07:15.542
What are you doing here?

07:15.544 --> 07:17.294
I knew you'd be home for another hour,

07:17.296 --> 07:18.645
so I brought you coffee.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.881
And I wanted to say...

07:20.883 --> 07:23.183
Thanks for understanding
the situation.

07:23.185 --> 07:24.501
Hey, you don't need to get all

07:24.503 --> 07:27.771
"Hallmark presents:
Johnny Soft Eyes" on me.

07:27.773 --> 07:30.107
Okay?
You're not my type, anyway.

07:30.109 --> 07:31.858
You're a bartender
who's close to liquor all night

07:31.860 --> 07:33.226
and your not an alcoholic.

07:33.228 --> 07:36.813
So clearly you don't know
how to seize an opportunity.

07:38.483 --> 07:40.784
Yes, I do.

07:44.663 --> 07:44.663
+

07:48.176 --> 07:49.860
This is where you join
in birthday song

07:49.862 --> 07:51.829
with your sweet-ass saxophone.

07:51.831 --> 07:54.348
Han, I like you, brother,

07:54.350 --> 07:55.883
but I played with everyone

07:55.885 --> 07:59.470
from Marvin Gaye to the gay Marvins.

07:59.472 --> 08:02.473
They never made it--a little bit
ahead of their time.

08:02.475 --> 08:05.426
But if you don't mind
a professional opinion, man,

08:05.428 --> 08:08.596
you've got to put some heart
into this thing.

08:08.598 --> 08:11.098
But my mother always say
to run away from heart--

08:11.100 --> 08:12.650
only the head can make music.

08:12.652 --> 08:15.653
Han, your mother sounds
like one cold--

08:15.655 --> 08:17.772
Don't you talk about my mama!

08:20.659 --> 08:21.909
Hey, Earl.
What's up?

08:21.911 --> 08:23.077
I just got threatened

08:23.079 --> 08:25.729
by a man who gets carded
at Pixar movies.

08:25.731 --> 08:28.232
Max, great news--

08:28.234 --> 08:30.567
that email blast I sent out
this morning worked.

08:30.569 --> 08:32.753
I just got us a big cupcake job

08:32.755 --> 08:35.339
at some event place
called the gold space loft.

08:35.341 --> 08:36.841
Last time I was
at the gold space loft,

08:36.842 --> 08:41.095
I went to a poetry slam,
and I wound up slamming a poet.

08:41.097 --> 08:43.547
They need 100 cupcakes
by tomorrow night.

08:43.549 --> 08:44.632
And because I'm a genius,

08:44.634 --> 08:46.183
and also because
it's such short notice--

08:46.185 --> 08:47.685
but mostly
because I'm a genius--

08:47.687 --> 08:49.553
I got them up to $500.

08:49.555 --> 08:51.421
It's a cool
group art show--

08:51.423 --> 08:54.809
very Williamsburg, very pot brownie.

08:54.811 --> 08:56.110
And Johnny has a piece in it.

08:56.112 --> 08:57.728
And since you flipped your switch,

08:57.730 --> 08:59.196
I figured it'd be fine.

08:59.198 --> 09:02.566
No way. I can't make
100 cupcakes in a day.

09:02.568 --> 09:04.318
Max, I know it's a lot of work,

09:04.320 --> 09:06.120
but I'll do whatever I can to help.

09:06.122 --> 09:08.539
This is a really big
opportunity for us.

09:08.541 --> 09:10.324
I kissed Johnny.

09:10.326 --> 09:11.625
What? When?

09:11.627 --> 09:14.078
He came by the apartment
right after you left.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.379
I was only gone 20 minutes.

09:15.381 --> 09:19.216
What'd you do--shine
a bat symbol on your vagina?

09:19.218 --> 09:22.786
Stop acting like
I wanted it to happen.

09:22.788 --> 09:25.172
I didn't want it to happen.
I'm lucky we just kissed.

09:25.174 --> 09:27.007
My pants kept saying,
"Take me off!"

09:27.009 --> 09:29.793
And I'm like,
"No, pants."

09:29.795 --> 09:33.597
I'm telling you,
I almost couldn't help myself.

09:33.599 --> 09:35.599
I don't understand.

09:35.601 --> 09:37.017
I thought you said
you were done with him.

09:37.019 --> 09:38.352
What happened to your pattern?

09:38.354 --> 09:40.637
Telling people I have a
pattern is part of the pattern.

09:40.639 --> 09:42.273
Then I just go and do whatever I want.

09:42.275 --> 09:44.491
I knew it, it thought it,
I should have said it--

09:44.493 --> 09:46.243
girls cannot be friends with guys.

09:46.245 --> 09:47.644
Yeah, well, you also knew
he was coming in here

09:47.646 --> 09:49.580
to tell me he broke up
with his girlfriend.

09:49.582 --> 09:51.582
So you can suck it.

09:51.584 --> 09:53.417
Did he say he was going
to break up with her?

09:53.419 --> 09:54.618
We didn't get into it.

09:54.620 --> 09:56.587
We weren't really using
our mouths for talking.

09:56.589 --> 09:58.956
What do you think's going to happen?

09:58.958 --> 10:00.374
I don't know.

10:00.376 --> 10:02.176
All I know is it's not going
to happen at a public art show

10:02.178 --> 10:03.677
in front of him
and his beautiful, cool

10:03.679 --> 10:04.828
British girlfriend.

10:04.830 --> 10:06.330
Max, you don't even have to see them.

10:06.332 --> 10:08.465
We'll get there early,
we'll drop off the cupcakes,

10:08.467 --> 10:10.551
and be gone before any
of the artists even show up.

10:10.553 --> 10:12.186
Great.
I'm going home tonight

10:12.188 --> 10:14.004
after my ten-hour
waitress shift,

10:14.006 --> 10:16.056
to stay up all night
and bake 100 cupcakes

10:16.058 --> 10:18.108
for a guy I kissed
who has a girlfriend.

10:18.110 --> 10:19.360
Beep.

10:19.362 --> 10:22.563
Ooh, what's that?
My self-esteem just flatlined.

10:25.867 --> 10:26.951
Yeah, it's this way.

10:26.953 --> 10:30.237
I smell patchouli and pretension.

10:30.239 --> 10:31.538
Why are you walking so slow?

10:31.540 --> 10:33.540
Because I'm carrying
our cupcake future,

10:33.542 --> 10:35.326
and I don't want half
of our future's frosting

10:35.328 --> 10:36.460
to be on top of the box.

10:36.462 --> 10:38.913
Relax.
We still have time.

10:38.915 --> 10:40.147
Oh, hello.

10:40.149 --> 10:41.665
Welcome to space blast art attack.

10:41.667 --> 10:43.801
The gallery won't be open
for, like, an hour.

10:43.803 --> 10:45.469
Actually, we're here
delivering the cupcakes.

10:45.471 --> 10:47.037
We're looking for someone
named Traivor.

10:47.039 --> 10:48.923
And I'm looking for Traivor's mom,

10:48.925 --> 10:51.759
to ask her why
she named a person Traivor.

10:51.761 --> 10:53.227
Traive!

10:53.229 --> 10:54.929
You girls can set up inside.

10:54.931 --> 10:57.765
He's the one
with the super-tall hat.

10:57.767 --> 10:59.817
I love galleries.

10:59.819 --> 11:01.819
My father and I had an art foundation.

11:01.821 --> 11:04.188
We taught blind kids
how to do ceramics.

11:04.190 --> 11:07.107
Why didn't you just buy them eyes?

11:07.109 --> 11:08.776
Let's put them here.

11:08.778 --> 11:10.894
This art show is ridiculous--

11:10.896 --> 11:12.496
someone named Traivor,

11:12.498 --> 11:14.615
a dreamcatcher
with buzzwords stuck in it.

11:15.617 --> 11:17.418
And you.

11:17.420 --> 11:19.903
Why would he hang that picture of us

11:19.905 --> 11:21.255
if he still has a girlfriend?

11:21.257 --> 11:22.957
Maybe he went home
and broke up with her

11:22.959 --> 11:24.174
after he kissed you.

11:24.176 --> 11:25.459
The writing is literally on the wall.

11:25.461 --> 11:27.795
Oh, no, no, no.
I'm not falling for you again.

11:27.797 --> 11:29.129
Let's just get our money and go.

11:29.131 --> 11:31.181
Oh, uh...

11:31.183 --> 11:33.550
Grown lady dressed like a doll,

11:33.552 --> 11:35.386
we can't find tall hat,

11:35.388 --> 11:37.304
and we need to get paid
for the cupcakes and leave.

11:37.306 --> 11:38.806
Leave?
What are you talking about.

11:38.808 --> 11:41.809
- You're serving the cupcakes.
- Pardon?

11:41.811 --> 11:44.761
Well, why do you think we're
paying you $500 for cupcakes?

11:44.763 --> 11:47.931
Because my friend's a genius.

11:47.933 --> 11:50.100
This is new information.

11:50.102 --> 11:52.453
We need to talk to someone.
Traive!

11:52.455 --> 11:55.039
Oh, no. Traive is busy
installing his ice penis.

11:55.041 --> 11:58.158
I could get someone else
on the show committee to help.

11:58.160 --> 11:59.410
Cashandra!

11:59.412 --> 12:01.912
What's his girlfriend doing here?

12:01.914 --> 12:03.297
Oh, God!

12:03.299 --> 12:05.416
What if soft eyes wussed out
and told her what happened?

12:05.418 --> 12:07.751
- Does she look mad?
- No, she looks amazing.

12:07.753 --> 12:09.003
Max, hello.

12:09.005 --> 12:10.554
We met that one time on the street.

12:10.556 --> 12:12.089
Cashandra, Johnny's girlfriend.

12:12.091 --> 12:14.058
Oh, hi, hi.
I'm Johnny's friend.

12:14.060 --> 12:15.559
We're just friends.

12:15.561 --> 12:17.678
Hi, "Cassandra."
I'm Caroline.

12:17.680 --> 12:18.846
I was with Max on the street.

12:18.848 --> 12:20.064
And all day yesterday.

12:20.066 --> 12:22.566
We were together every minute.

12:22.568 --> 12:24.101
It's Cash-andra, actually.

12:24.103 --> 12:25.402
But everyone calls me Cash.

12:25.404 --> 12:27.137
And you're Max's
business partner, right?

12:27.139 --> 12:30.240
Yeah, but she makes her own decisions.

12:30.242 --> 12:32.910
Right. Well, let's just
get to it, shall we?

12:32.912 --> 12:34.611
I'm a bleeder.

12:34.613 --> 12:36.580
It's brilliant it all worked out

12:36.582 --> 12:38.982
- with the cupcakes.
- Excuse me?

12:38.984 --> 12:40.617
Well, I told Traive
to hire you for the show.

12:40.619 --> 12:43.420
Johnny cannot stop talking
about your cupcakes, Max.

12:43.422 --> 12:45.255
"Max's cupcakes are so moist."

12:45.257 --> 12:46.924
"Max's cupcakes are delicious."

12:46.926 --> 12:48.675
He loves your cupcakes.

12:48.677 --> 12:50.327
Yeah, yeah.

12:50.329 --> 12:51.328
But just like in a casual way.

12:51.330 --> 12:54.181
I mean, he barely even touched them.

12:54.183 --> 12:56.967
So, um, I'm a bit busy
getting ready for the show.

12:56.969 --> 12:59.053
Why don't you put your little
cupcakes on these trays,

12:59.055 --> 13:01.438
and when people start coming in,
circulate, right?

13:01.440 --> 13:03.424
Circulate, girls, circulate.

13:05.110 --> 13:07.644
Well, that wasn't uncomfortable.

13:07.646 --> 13:09.813
Come on, let's bolt
before Johnny gets here,

13:09.815 --> 13:11.615
while I at least have
a shred of my dignity.

13:11.617 --> 13:13.534
We can't just bail out
of our first big job.

13:13.536 --> 13:15.369
If we do,
people will think we're flakes.

13:15.371 --> 13:17.704
And that'll spread faster
through Williamsburg

13:17.706 --> 13:19.206
than knit hats and herpes.

13:19.208 --> 13:21.625
Hey, you ladies know
where the wine goes?

13:21.627 --> 13:22.743
- Oh--
- Right here.

13:22.745 --> 13:25.079
Yeah.

13:26.278 --> 13:26.278
+

13:30.168 --> 13:32.169
No! Just, uh, not the wine.
The wine's mine.

13:32.171 --> 13:34.271
Just serving cupcakes.

13:34.273 --> 13:37.007
I've been listening in on Cashandra

13:37.009 --> 13:38.359
and her girlfriends' conversations,

13:38.361 --> 13:39.810
and I don't think she knows
anything happened

13:39.812 --> 13:40.894
between you two.

13:40.896 --> 13:42.512
I also learned she's a dancer,

13:42.514 --> 13:43.680
her lip gloss is from Kiehl's,

13:43.682 --> 13:45.866
and she's school chums with Adele.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.351
<i>Not the Adele.</i>

13:47.353 --> 13:50.537
Damn it!
Could she be any cooler?

13:50.539 --> 13:52.072
I want her to be my girlfriend.

13:52.074 --> 13:54.325
I wouldn't break up with her for me.

13:54.327 --> 13:56.543
Hi. I'm here.

13:56.545 --> 13:59.330
Great. I was hoping
tonight would get weirder.

13:59.332 --> 14:01.649
I had no idea.

14:01.651 --> 14:02.966
She did it to surprise me.

14:02.968 --> 14:04.534
And she did--
I'm surprised.

14:04.536 --> 14:06.470
I am so sorry.

14:06.472 --> 14:08.806
You have a girlfriend.
Why are you kissing Max?

14:08.808 --> 14:10.040
You told her?

14:10.042 --> 14:11.392
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

14:11.394 --> 14:12.926
Would the more subtle way
be to paint a picture

14:12.928 --> 14:16.313
and hang it on the wall
for all to see?

14:16.315 --> 14:17.681
Are you insane?

14:17.683 --> 14:19.683
Could we have a moment, please?

14:19.685 --> 14:20.734
Fine.

14:20.736 --> 14:23.103
I'll be over there near the ice penis.

14:25.056 --> 14:27.441
Look, I am so sorry.

14:27.443 --> 14:29.777
If I had known Cash was going
to ask you to do all of this,

14:29.779 --> 14:31.061
I would have told you.

14:31.063 --> 14:32.896
And why would you choose to hang that?

14:32.898 --> 14:34.782
'Cause it's my favorite piece.

14:34.784 --> 14:37.000
Is there any way
she could know what happened?

14:37.002 --> 14:39.253
No.

14:39.255 --> 14:41.338
- Oh, my God. Your lips.
- Split up.

14:41.340 --> 14:43.740
I can smell the sex
from across the room.

14:45.677 --> 14:49.129
No-whoa-whoa!
I need all those.

14:49.131 --> 14:51.098
So what?
Is she still your girlfriend?

14:51.100 --> 14:52.466
Max, it's complicated.

14:52.468 --> 14:55.018
What, are we on Facebook?

14:55.020 --> 14:57.921
<i>It is complicated.</i>

14:57.923 --> 14:59.256
Cash and I have been together
two years,

14:59.258 --> 15:00.441
- and when--
- Two years?

15:00.443 --> 15:01.809
Jeez, I'm a home wrecker.

15:01.811 --> 15:05.229
Adele will probably write
a song about me.

15:06.531 --> 15:07.648
You're not a homewrecker.

15:07.650 --> 15:09.266
- I am.
- Johnny!

15:09.268 --> 15:11.402
You've got some folks.

15:11.404 --> 15:13.937
Circulate, Max, circulate.

15:15.940 --> 15:17.458
That's it.
This is over.

15:17.460 --> 15:20.461
That--us on the wall--
never happens again.

15:20.463 --> 15:22.079
I lied.
I can't be your friend.

15:22.081 --> 15:24.214
I was trying to be cool,
but I'm not cool.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.166
I don't know Adele.

15:27.836 --> 15:29.420
What just happened over there?
Did he tell you

15:29.422 --> 15:30.787
he's breaking up with his girlfriend?

15:30.789 --> 15:33.006
No.
What's wrong with you?

15:33.008 --> 15:34.975
You haven't been right about anything?

15:34.977 --> 15:38.395
I told him we are done,
and that's over, okay?

15:38.397 --> 15:40.981
They've been together two years.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.650
And I know one thing about me--
I may pick the wrong guys,

15:43.652 --> 15:45.469
but when I hear
another woman is involved,

15:45.471 --> 15:46.520
I am done.

15:46.522 --> 15:49.773
This is truly the end of my pattern.

15:49.775 --> 15:51.575
We have to go--
I kissed Johnny again.

15:51.577 --> 15:52.993
What?
Max, you said

15:52.995 --> 15:54.278
you were going to the bathroom.

15:54.280 --> 15:55.829
I did.
And so did he.

15:55.831 --> 15:57.164
It's a unisex bathroom--

15:57.166 --> 15:59.950
emphasis on the sex.

15:59.952 --> 16:01.084
We have to go.

16:01.086 --> 16:02.836
I'm a little drunk and out of control.

16:02.838 --> 16:04.955
Traive said we won't get paid

16:04.957 --> 16:06.590
until every single one
of the cupcakes is gone.

16:06.592 --> 16:08.158
- So we're stuck here.
- Fine.

16:08.160 --> 16:09.960
I shall go circulate.

16:09.962 --> 16:11.495
No. You cannot be trusted.

16:11.497 --> 16:15.098
Next thing I know, you'll be
doing him behind the ice penis.

16:16.384 --> 16:18.385
I'm telling you, I am done.

16:18.387 --> 16:20.337
You told me that five minutes ago.

16:20.339 --> 16:22.022
Well, you told me he was breaking up

16:22.024 --> 16:23.507
with his girlfriend three times.

16:23.509 --> 16:26.176
So I guess we learned tonight
that you know nothing about him,

16:26.178 --> 16:27.811
and I know nothing about me.

16:27.813 --> 16:29.279
Cheers!

16:29.281 --> 16:31.648
Wait for me.

16:31.650 --> 16:33.016
Hello, girls.

16:33.018 --> 16:34.684
Traivor told me
you were looking to get paid.

16:34.686 --> 16:36.520
But just to be clear,
you can't actually be paid

16:36.522 --> 16:37.821
until all the cupcakes are gone.

16:37.823 --> 16:39.156
And do me a favor, love,

16:39.158 --> 16:40.791
put a chocolate aside for Johnny.

16:40.793 --> 16:42.025
He loves chocolate.

16:42.027 --> 16:43.627
He'll eat a vanilla if it's available,

16:43.629 --> 16:45.879
but he always goes back to chocolate.

16:50.535 --> 16:52.719
I don't think he's going
to break up with her.

16:52.721 --> 16:54.871
Really?

16:54.873 --> 17:00.394
You have the accuracy rate
of a magic 8 ball.

17:02.381 --> 17:05.598
Look at her.
She's so pretty.

17:05.601 --> 17:08.234
And bitchy.
And...

17:08.237 --> 17:11.320
More pretty than bitchy.

17:11.323 --> 17:13.890
Oh, God.
She just zipped his hoodie

17:13.892 --> 17:16.660
and fixed his hair--
that's a couple.

17:16.662 --> 17:17.944
What they have is real.

17:17.946 --> 17:20.564
They are a couple--
Johnny and Cash.

17:20.566 --> 17:24.334
Oh-ho, crap!
Johnny Cash!

17:26.253 --> 17:27.904
They're an institution.

17:27.906 --> 17:29.790
I never had a chance.

17:29.792 --> 17:31.708
Forget the money--
let's just go.

17:31.710 --> 17:32.909
Mm-mmm.

17:32.911 --> 17:35.345
We are staying till
these cupcakes are gone.

17:35.347 --> 17:38.215
I am not leaving
with no dignity and no money.

17:38.217 --> 17:40.384
Fine, I'll circulate
a couple more times.

17:40.386 --> 17:42.019
Wait a minute.

17:42.021 --> 17:44.254
They said they had to be gone,

17:44.256 --> 17:47.808
but they didn't say
who had to make them gone.

17:47.810 --> 17:51.645
We eat them and go!

17:51.647 --> 17:53.780
You're doing it!
I rescued you from the gutter.

17:53.782 --> 17:57.868
Uh, well, that's
not entirely accura--

18:04.659 --> 18:07.895
Mm-hmm!

18:11.549 --> 18:14.084
Mmm, mmm.

18:24.979 --> 18:26.396
Max, wake up.

18:26.398 --> 18:27.481
It's 3:00.

18:27.483 --> 18:28.649
We forgot to set the alarm.

18:31.470 --> 18:32.686
Oh, I never thought waking up in bed

18:32.688 --> 18:35.739
with another woman
with...Frosting on my boobs,

18:35.741 --> 18:38.492
would be this depressing.

18:38.494 --> 18:40.644
How are you feeling
about it all today?

18:40.646 --> 18:41.745
Do you want to talk?

18:41.747 --> 18:45.415
- No.
- Good.

18:56.794 --> 18:59.012
Where's your purse?

18:59.014 --> 19:00.597
I'm going to take some
of the money we made last night

19:00.599 --> 19:01.965
and get coffee.
And yes--

19:01.967 --> 19:03.667
I am walking down the street
like this,

19:03.669 --> 19:07.771
because after last night,
I am impenetrable to shame.

19:07.773 --> 19:09.773
Wait, we don't have any money.

19:09.775 --> 19:11.174
- Yes, we do.
- No, we don't.

19:11.176 --> 19:12.309
We did, but we don't.

19:12.311 --> 19:15.028
I bought something with it.

19:15.030 --> 19:17.531
I bought this.

19:17.533 --> 19:20.734
You carried that home?
Where was I?

19:20.736 --> 19:21.851
Three blocks ahead of me,

19:21.853 --> 19:25.739
telling strangers about your pattern.

19:25.741 --> 19:27.207
I saw you and Johnny
just hanging there,

19:27.209 --> 19:29.042
and I knew what I had to do.

19:29.044 --> 19:31.044
So what, am I supposed
to hang that up?

19:31.046 --> 19:33.163
No. You're supposed
to destroy it.

19:33.165 --> 19:36.366
You need to get over him,
so you're going to kick this,

19:36.368 --> 19:38.168
and then you're going
to kick him once and for all.

19:38.170 --> 19:39.586
You want to break your pattern?

19:39.588 --> 19:41.371
Start by breaking the painting.

19:41.373 --> 19:43.557
That is a complete waste of money.

19:43.559 --> 19:45.759
I may have been wrong about
everything else about Johnny,

19:45.761 --> 19:48.595
but I'm right about this.
Come on.

19:48.597 --> 19:50.897
Kick it.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.151
I can't.

19:54.153 --> 19:55.852
- Give me your foot.
- What?

19:55.854 --> 19:57.487
Lift up your leg.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.609
Yay! You did it.

20:02.611 --> 20:04.244
Good for you!

20:04.246 --> 20:07.414
You broke a painting
and maybe your pattern.

20:08.366 --> 20:10.367
I really liked him.

20:10.369 --> 20:12.502
I know.

20:12.504 --> 20:14.788
Well?

20:14.790 --> 20:17.791
I slept through my day job,
so what the heck?

20:17.793 --> 20:20.177
I think I will take to the bed
or whatever.

20:20.179 --> 20:23.130
Just for like 20 minutes.

20:23.132 --> 20:24.598
I'll set my alarm and then I'll get up

20:24.600 --> 20:26.216
and get ready for work.

20:26.218 --> 20:29.770
Max, please,
I feel like we need a hug.

20:29.772 --> 20:32.522
We just slept together!
You women are so needy.
