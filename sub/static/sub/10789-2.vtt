WEBVTT

01:25.917 --> 01:27.041
HEY.

01:28.333 --> 01:29.542
YOU'RE UP.

01:29.542 --> 01:32.250
YEAH. UM, YOU WENT OUT.

01:33.583 --> 01:34.750
YEAH.

01:34.750 --> 01:36.583
COULD YOU...

01:36.583 --> 01:38.792
SURE.

01:41.417 --> 01:44.041
THANKS.

01:51.250 --> 01:52.458
SO I GOT YOU A--

01:52.458 --> 01:54.583
DID YOU GET ME
A LATTE?

01:54.583 --> 01:55.959
ROSES.

01:57.166 --> 01:58.291
ALL OVER WORTHINGTON.

02:04.083 --> 02:06.125
KINDA HOKEY,
DON'T YOU THINK?

02:06.125 --> 02:09.542
YEAH, THAT'S
EXACTLY WHAT I THINK.

02:09.542 --> 02:12.375
WELL, IT'S A $500 FINE
TO PICK ONE OF THESE.

02:13.792 --> 02:14.458
WORTH EVERY PENNY.

02:17.000 --> 02:21.083
SO WE SHOULD PROBABLY
STOP AND THINK ABOUT THIS.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.667
YOU KNOW,
ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS.

02:24.667 --> 02:27.583
I MEAN, ABOUT HOW
THIS WILL CHANGE...

02:29.083 --> 02:30.792
THINGS.

02:33.458 --> 02:34.917
MAYBE LATER.

02:40.291 --> 02:42.625
(GIGGLES)

03:37.458 --> 03:39.250
YES. HELLO.

03:39.250 --> 03:40.792
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU COULD BRING UP--

03:40.792 --> 03:42.125
NO, NO, NO, NO.

03:42.125 --> 03:43.000
NO ROOM SERVICE
FOR YOU THIS MORNING.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.667
WHAT? WE CAN AFFORD IT.

03:45.667 --> 03:47.792
WE?

03:47.792 --> 03:50.583
OK. MY DAD
CAN AFFORD IT.

03:50.583 --> 03:52.208
WHAT DO YOU SAY,
CHAMPAGNE?
BLOODY MARYS?

03:52.208 --> 03:54.166
I SAY THAT WE'RE NOT
ON THE SET OF DYNASTY

03:54.166 --> 03:55.792
AND YOU HAVE CLASS
IN AN HOUR.

03:55.792 --> 03:57.792
NOW, WHICH TIE?

03:57.792 --> 04:00.041
MMM, I DON'T KNOW.
THEY'RE BOTH
KIND OF HIDEOUS.

04:00.041 --> 04:01.542
OK, LOOK. YOU'LL
HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
FOR FASHION CRITIQUES

04:01.542 --> 04:02.583
ONCE I ACTUALLY
GET THE JOB,
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW,

04:02.583 --> 04:05.208
I JUST DON'T
WANT TO BE LATE
FOR THE INTERVIEW. OK?

04:05.208 --> 04:07.542
I'M SURE THAT IT
IS JUST A TECHNICALITY.

04:07.542 --> 04:10.125
TRUST ME. WHEN MY DAD PULLS
STRINGS, THEY STAY PULLED.

04:10.125 --> 04:13.291
HOW DO YOU THINK
I GOT INTO WORTHINGTON?

04:13.291 --> 04:15.458
OH, OH. ARE THEY ALWAYS
SUPPOSED TO BE THIS TIGHT?

04:15.458 --> 04:17.916
YOU HAVE ACTUALLY WORN A TIE
BEFORE, HAVEN'T YOU, PACEY?

04:17.916 --> 04:19.500
OF COURSE I HAVE. ONCE.

04:19.500 --> 04:20.500
ONCE.

04:20.500 --> 04:21.583
YES, ONCE.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.417
MMM.

04:23.417 --> 04:25.166
OK. WISH ME LUCK.
I'M OUT THE DOOR.

04:25.166 --> 04:26.625
LUCK!

04:35.583 --> 04:39.500
YES, HELLO.
IS THIS ROOM SERVICE?

04:39.500 --> 04:41.583
OH, MY GOSH.
YOU KNOW MY NAME. HOW COOL.

04:41.583 --> 04:44.834
YEAH, I'M FEELING A LITTLE
CONTINENTAL THIS MORNING.

04:44.834 --> 04:47.458
OK, SO WE SHARE
THE ART HISTORY.

04:47.458 --> 04:50.208
UM, ALL THIS KAFKA
IS MINE, AND THEY GAVE US
A MATH BOOK BY MISTAKE.

04:50.208 --> 04:54.125
OH! I'LL TAKE THAT,
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

04:54.125 --> 04:55.375
WAIT A SECOND. MATH?

04:55.375 --> 04:56.208
DON'T TELL ME YOU
ACTUALLY TOOK MY ADVICE.

04:56.208 --> 04:59.959
STRANGER THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED.

04:59.959 --> 05:01.750
AND I SUPPOSE
THIS HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THE FACT

05:01.750 --> 05:03.291
THAT A CERTAIN SOMEONE
ACTUALLY TEACHES MATH?

05:03.291 --> 05:06.000
ARE YOU IMPLYING
THAT THERE'S ANYTHING WRONG

05:06.000 --> 05:08.917
WITH TAKING AN INTEREST
IN SOMEONE'S LIFE'S WORK?

05:08.917 --> 05:10.959
I THINK
IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

05:10.959 --> 05:13.291
I MEAN, ONE MINUTE
YOU'RE TAKING AN INTEREST

05:13.291 --> 05:16.542
AND THE NEXT YOU'RE
SUBLIMATING YOUR OWN
THOUGHTS AND DESIRES,

05:16.542 --> 05:18.500
AND FOR WHAT?

05:18.500 --> 05:21.125
FOR A GRAND CHANCE
TO PARTICIPATE

05:21.125 --> 05:23.667
IN THE GREAT PATRIARCHAL
HETEROSEXIST FRAUD

05:23.667 --> 05:25.041
THAT IS BETTER KNOWN
AS MONOGAMY?

05:25.041 --> 05:28.667
I MEAN, IS THAT REALLY
HOW YOU WANT TO SPEND
YOUR GOLDEN YEARS,

05:28.667 --> 05:32.291
FOLDING SOME MAN'S LAUNDRY
AND PRETENDING TO ACTUALLY
SHARE AN INTEREST?

05:32.291 --> 05:36.208
I MEAN, HAVEN'T WE COME
FURTHER AS A SEX--WHAT?

05:36.208 --> 05:37.792
HI.

05:37.792 --> 05:39.250
HI. I'M SORRY.
ARE WE BOTHERING YOU?

05:39.250 --> 05:40.625
BECAUSE, PERHAPS
IF IT'S NOT
TOO MUCH TROUBLE,

05:40.625 --> 05:42.083
YOU COULD JUST GET
YOUR OWN CONVERSATION.

05:42.083 --> 05:44.583
NO. SORRY.

05:44.583 --> 05:46.333
IT'S JUST THAT I'VE
BEEN SITTING HERE
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

05:46.333 --> 05:47.583
WHERE I'VE MET YOU
BEFORE,

05:47.583 --> 05:50.875
AND SUDDENLY I
REALIZED I'VE NEVER
MET YOU BEFORE.

05:50.875 --> 05:53.166
GREAT. WELL,
I'M REALLY GLAD THAT WE
GOT THAT FIGURED OUT.

05:53.166 --> 05:56.041
I'VE HEARD YOU
ON THE RADIO.

05:56.041 --> 05:58.417
SHE WAS ON THE RADIO.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.834
WELL, YOU WERE.

06:00.834 --> 06:02.542
SHE WAS VERY GOOD, TOO.

06:02.542 --> 06:05.667
OK, YOU GOT ME.
I'M BUSTED.
I WAS ON THE RADIO.

06:05.667 --> 06:08.083
BUT I'M NOT ANYMORE,
SO...

06:09.542 --> 06:11.750
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR LISTENING
AND BUH-BYE.

06:11.750 --> 06:14.458
SO DID YOU
GET FIRED OR WHAT?

06:16.875 --> 06:17.875
WHAT IS THIS,
AN INTERVIEW?

06:17.875 --> 06:20.166
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

06:20.166 --> 06:22.041
(SIGHS)

06:22.041 --> 06:23.875
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
THAT I HAD SOME...

06:23.875 --> 06:26.041
ARTISTIC DIFFERENCES
WITH THE NEW MANAGEMENT.

06:26.041 --> 06:28.166
FINE. THEN
WE'LL JUST SAY THAT.

06:28.166 --> 06:29.667
FINE.

06:33.333 --> 06:35.208
EXCUSE ME, YOUNG MAN.

06:35.208 --> 06:36.500
WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN US?

06:41.917 --> 06:43.875
IT'S 8:35
ON A SATURDAY MORNING.

06:43.875 --> 06:46.250
THE PHONE RINGS.
WHO IS IT?

06:46.250 --> 06:48.041
CABLE COMPANY,
PHONE COMPANY,

06:48.041 --> 06:49.208
DEBT CONSOLIDATORS.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.583
WHY DO THEY
KEEP CALLING BACK?

06:51.583 --> 06:52.417
BECAUSE IT WORKS.

06:52.417 --> 06:58.000
NOW, IF YOU DON'T THINK
YOU CAN DO THAT,

06:58.000 --> 06:59.959
IF YOU DON'T THINK
YOU CAN COMMIT

06:59.959 --> 07:02.250
TO BECOMING
THE LOWEST FORM OF LIFE,

07:02.250 --> 07:04.417
THE KIND
THAT LIVES BY HIS WITS,

07:04.417 --> 07:08.291
THE KIND THAT DOESN'T
TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER,

07:08.291 --> 07:10.583
THEN I SUGGEST
YOU LEAVE.

07:10.583 --> 07:12.917
NO. YOU KNOW WHAT?
IN FACT, I INSIST YOU LEAVE.

07:12.917 --> 07:14.125
RIGHT NOW!

07:19.750 --> 07:21.959
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

07:21.959 --> 07:23.542
TO CLARIFY:

07:23.542 --> 07:26.166
THE HOURS ARE LONG,
THE PAY IS CRAP,

07:26.166 --> 07:27.625
WHEN YOU'RE NOT WORKING,
YOU WILL BE STUDYING

07:27.625 --> 07:29.375
FOR YOUR SERIES 7
STOCKBROKER EXAM.

07:29.375 --> 07:32.208
THERE ARE
NO SECOND CHANCES HERE.

07:32.208 --> 07:33.583
IF YOU DO NOT PASS THIS TEST
ON YOUR FIRST TRY,

07:33.583 --> 07:37.166
YOU WILL BE LET GO
FROM THE TRAINING PROGRAM

07:37.166 --> 07:40.208
AND REPLACED BY ONE
OF A ZILLION OTHER GUYS

07:40.208 --> 07:42.917
WHO WOULD KILL
TO HAVE THIS JOB.

07:43.959 --> 07:45.750
QUESTIONS?

07:49.583 --> 07:54.083
WELL, GIVEN HOW COMPLETELY
AND HISTORICALLY SCREWED

07:54.083 --> 07:54.917
THE MARKET IS RIGHT NOW,

07:54.917 --> 07:57.917
WHY WOULD ANY SANE PERSON
WANT THIS JOB?

07:57.917 --> 08:00.250
SAME REASON PEOPLE
PLAY THE LOTTERY.

08:00.250 --> 08:01.625
YOU MEAN MONEY?

08:01.625 --> 08:02.500
NO.

08:02.500 --> 08:06.625
NOT THAT THERE'S
ANYTHING WRONG
WITH MONEY.

08:06.625 --> 08:08.708
I MEAN HOPE.

08:10.500 --> 08:13.792
THAT TINY SURGE
OF ADRENALINE

08:13.792 --> 08:15.333
THAT COURSES
THROUGH YOUR VEINS

08:15.333 --> 08:17.750
RIGHT BEFORE YOU CHECK
THE WINNING NUMBERS.

08:17.750 --> 08:20.583
THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE SELLING HERE.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.500
THAT'S WHAT EVERY
STOCKBROKER SELLS,

08:23.500 --> 08:24.708
AND YOU ALL
WOULDN'T BE HERE

08:24.708 --> 08:25.959
IF YOU DIDN'T
WANT SOME OF IT.

08:25.959 --> 08:28.500
SO, THOSE OF YOU
WHO WANT IT BAD ENOUGH,

08:28.500 --> 08:30.000
I'LL SEE YOU
MONDAY MORNING.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.582
OTHERWISE, DISPERSE.

08:39.417 --> 08:43.500
I ACTUALLY DO
HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION.

08:43.500 --> 08:44.875
SHOOT.

08:44.875 --> 08:47.375
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

08:50.583 --> 08:51.792
RICH RINALDI.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.750
PACEY WITTER.

08:53.750 --> 08:55.208
AND, MR. RINALDI, I DON'T
NEED TILL MONDAY MORNING.

08:55.208 --> 08:56.667
I'M IN RIGHT NOW.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.500
LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING
WITH YOU, PACEY.

09:00.500 --> 09:02.875
OK.

09:04.041 --> 09:06.208
AND, UH...

09:06.208 --> 09:08.208
YOU MIGHT WANT
TO RETHINK THAT SUIT.

09:08.208 --> 09:09.750
SEEMS A LITTLE GAY.

09:12.000 --> 09:13.208
AHEM.

09:32.250 --> 09:33.792
HI.

09:33.792 --> 09:35.208
HI.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.458
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

09:37.458 --> 09:38.667
THANK YOU.

09:40.875 --> 09:42.542
DO YOU HAVE
TO WORK TODAY?

09:42.542 --> 09:44.917
YEAH. YEAH.
UH, BUT I WAS THINKING

09:44.917 --> 09:46.375
MAYBE WE COULD
GET TOGETHER LATER ON.

09:46.375 --> 09:47.208
GREAT.
LIKE AROUND 5:00?

09:47.208 --> 09:49.250
SURE.
OK.

09:49.250 --> 09:50.667
I'LL, UH,
I'LL CALL YOU.

09:50.667 --> 09:51.834
GREAT.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.959
NOT LIKE,
"I'LL CALL YOU,"
LIKE THE BAD CLICHE,

09:53.959 --> 09:55.625
LIKE I SAY
THAT I'LL CALL YOU
AND I NEVER DO.

09:55.625 --> 09:58.542
YOU MEAN NOT LIKE
THE STANDARD BLOW-OFF
YOU GET FROM A FRAT GUY

09:58.542 --> 10:01.458
TRYING TO MAKE A GRACEFUL EXIT
FROM THE WORLD'S MOST
EMBARRASSING HOOK-UP?

10:01.458 --> 10:04.750
YES. I MEAN, NO.
NOT--NOT LIKE THAT.

10:04.750 --> 10:05.834
NOT EMBARRASSING.

10:05.834 --> 10:07.583
HA HA!

10:07.583 --> 10:10.125
NONE OF THAT. NO.

10:10.125 --> 10:13.208
SO I GUESS
WE'RE IN AGREEMENT

10:13.208 --> 10:16.291
THAT SINCE LAST NIGHT,
WORDS HAVE TOTALLY
LOST ALL MEANING.

10:16.291 --> 10:19.041
BECAUSE I JUST SPENT
15 MINUTES IN THAT BATHROOM

10:19.041 --> 10:20.708
TRYING TO THINK
OF SOMETHING TO SAY TO YOU,

10:20.708 --> 10:23.834
AND, WELL, ALL I COULD
COME UP WITH WAS "HI."

10:23.834 --> 10:26.125
I LIKED IT.
IT WAS HEARTFELT
AND SINCERE.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.583
IT WAS IDIOTIC.

10:27.583 --> 10:28.583
I CAN TOP THAT.

10:28.583 --> 10:30.125
THE NOTE THAT I LEFT
ON YOUR PILLOW
THIS MORNING?

10:30.125 --> 10:32.250
4 DRAFTS.

10:32.250 --> 10:34.000
I SPENT LIKE AN HOUR
TRYING TO COME UP
WITH SOMETHING

10:34.000 --> 10:35.959
HISTORICALLY MEANINGFUL
TO SAY TO YOU,

10:35.959 --> 10:36.542
SOMETHING THAT WOULD
ENCAPSULATE EVERYTHING

10:36.542 --> 10:38.750
ABOUT HOW
I FELT ABOUT US,

10:38.750 --> 10:40.417
ABOUT SEX, ABOUT
THE MOST INCREDIBLE
NIGHT OF MY LIFE,

10:40.417 --> 10:42.959
AND YOU KNOW
WHAT I CAME UP WITH?

10:42.959 --> 10:43.917
"WENT OUT FOR BREAKFAST."

10:43.917 --> 10:45.708
4 OF THE DUMBEST WORDS
IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE,

10:45.708 --> 10:47.792
AND NOT ONE OF THEM SAYS
WHAT I MEANT TO SAY.

10:50.625 --> 10:53.250
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

10:53.250 --> 10:55.166
I HAVE TO GET THAT.

10:58.083 --> 10:59.291
HELLO.

10:59.291 --> 11:00.458
Todd:
LEERY, I'M WAITING!

11:00.458 --> 11:01.458
WHY AM I WAITING, YOU ASK?

11:01.458 --> 11:03.959
'CAUSE YOU'RE
NOT BLOODY HERE.

11:03.959 --> 11:05.125
YEAH, SORRY ABOUT THAT.
I WAS--

11:05.125 --> 11:06.500
YOU'RE JUST GONNA
GET YOUR ASS OVER HERE,

11:06.500 --> 11:07.917
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA DO.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.834
GO. CALL ME LATER.

11:11.834 --> 11:13.875
OK. AND THEN
WE CAN TALK.

11:13.875 --> 11:15.083
WE CAN FINISH
WHAT WE WERE--

11:15.083 --> 11:17.291
RIGHT, BUT I HAVE
ONE IMPORTANT THING

11:17.291 --> 11:18.750
TO ASK YOU RIGHT NOW.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.166
WHAT?

11:20.166 --> 11:21.583
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE OTHER 3 DRAFTS?

11:21.583 --> 11:22.583
OH, I TOSSED THEM
IN THE DUMPSTER.

11:22.583 --> 11:26.125
I SEE. WHEN YOU
WENT OUT TO GET COFFEE?

11:26.125 --> 11:27.417
YEAH.

11:27.417 --> 11:29.667
I THOUGHT THAT
WAS A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS.

11:29.667 --> 11:32.458
IT WAS, ACTUALLY,
AND--AND NOW
THAT YOU MENTION IT,

11:32.458 --> 11:33.834
UM...

11:33.834 --> 11:34.875
(TELEPHONE RINGS)

11:38.583 --> 11:39.417
TODD CALLING.

11:39.417 --> 11:41.750
HOW COULD YOU TELL?

11:41.750 --> 11:44.834
I'M ASSUMING SATAN
COULD ONLY BE ONE PERSON

11:44.834 --> 11:46.000
OTHER THAN
BEELZEBUB HIMSELF.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.917
HELLO.

11:47.917 --> 11:49.166
I'M GONNA NEED
A TRIPLE ESPRESSO

11:49.166 --> 11:51.417
AND SOME SORT
OF PASTRY-TYPE SITUATION,

11:51.417 --> 11:52.834
PREFERABLY ITALIAN.

11:52.834 --> 11:53.125
I'M ON MY...
(CLICK)

11:53.125 --> 11:55.917
WAY.

11:55.917 --> 11:57.417
GO. GET OUT OF HERE.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.458
I'M AFRAID
TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS

11:59.458 --> 12:01.875
IF THE DEVIL CALLS
3 TIMES IN ONE HOUR.

12:01.875 --> 12:02.834
YOU KNOW,
BEFORE I LEAVE,

12:02.834 --> 12:03.125
I JUST WANT TO MAKE
ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN--

12:03.125 --> 12:04.959
DAWSON...

12:10.083 --> 12:10.917
(WHISPERS)
Shut up.

12:17.291 --> 12:19.500
Good-bye.

12:52.834 --> 12:54.333
WOULD YOU MURDER SOMEONE
IN THIS ALLEY?

12:54.333 --> 12:56.458
YEAH, YOU, FOR WANTING
TO CHANGE A LOCATION

12:56.458 --> 12:58.750
18 OTHER PEOPLE
HAVE SIGNED OFF ON. HERE.

12:58.750 --> 12:59.750
WHAT? NO 20-MINUTE SPEECH
ON HOW YOU'RE TOO GOOD
TO GET MY COFFEE?

12:59.750 --> 13:02.583
NO 20-MINUTE TIRADE
ON HOW IT'S COLD?

13:02.583 --> 13:03.500
I MUST BE MELLOWING.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.750
OR I'VE BEEN BRINGING YOU
DECAF ALL SUMMER.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.250
HA HA HA HA! RIGHT.

13:07.250 --> 13:08.792
WHICH WOULD EXPLAIN
THE LACK OF ME
YELLING AT YOU

13:08.792 --> 13:10.000
THIS MORNING
WHEN YOU FAILED
TO SHOW UP

13:10.000 --> 13:11.250
AT OUR PREARRANGED
MEETING PLACE.

13:11.250 --> 13:12.250
THAT WAS
A LACK OF YELLING?

13:14.291 --> 13:15.583
YOU WEREN'T
IN YOUR ROOM, EITHER.

13:15.583 --> 13:18.000
NO.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.458
I SPENT THE NIGHT
AT A FRIEND'S.

13:19.458 --> 13:22.291
A FRIEND'S?
HAD I KNOWN YOU ACTUALLY
HAD ANY FRIENDS,

13:22.291 --> 13:24.875
I WOULDN'T HAVE WASTED
VALUABLE PRODUCTION
DOLLARS ON LODGING YOU.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.875
WELL.

13:28.458 --> 13:30.500
WELL...DETAILS.

13:30.500 --> 13:31.625
NOT A CHANCE.

13:31.625 --> 13:33.500
EVERY GOOD THING
THAT'S HAPPENED IN MY LIFE

13:33.500 --> 13:34.834
I'VE ESSENTIALLY MANAGED
TO TALK OUT OF EXISTENCE.

13:34.834 --> 13:36.291
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT
THIS TIME.

13:36.291 --> 13:38.417
SUIT YOURSELF.

13:38.417 --> 13:40.083
SO, WHAT AM I
DOING TODAY?

13:40.083 --> 13:41.834
YOU'LL FIND OUT
WHEN YOU GET THERE.

13:41.834 --> 13:43.000
FAIR ENOUGH.

13:59.333 --> 14:00.333
EXCUSE ME.

14:00.333 --> 14:01.792
YEAH.

14:01.792 --> 14:03.750
YOU OBVIOUSLY
DON'T REMEMBER ME, BUT--

14:03.750 --> 14:05.125
OH, YEAH. SURE.
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

14:08.041 --> 14:09.041
EXCUSE ME.

14:09.041 --> 14:11.458
SORRY, I DON'T REALLY
HAVE TIME TO CHIT-CHAT.

14:11.458 --> 14:14.041
I'M NOT ATTEMPTING
TO FORGE SOME KIND
OF SOCIAL CONNECTION HERE.

14:14.041 --> 14:15.250
WELL, GOOD, BECAUSE--

14:15.250 --> 14:16.500
YOU CAN JUST APOLOGIZE
AND WE'LL MOVE ON.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.166
APOLOGIZE?
YEAH.

14:18.166 --> 14:19.458
LOOK,
IT'S REALLY SIMPLE.

14:19.458 --> 14:20.583
YOU READ THE BOOK,
YOU COME TO CLASS.

14:20.583 --> 14:21.875
PREFERABLY
IN THAT ORDER.

14:21.875 --> 14:23.375
YOU FINISHED?

14:23.375 --> 14:24.667
YES.
GOOD.

14:24.667 --> 14:26.667
YOU BUMPED INTO ME
JUST NOW IN YOUR MAD DASH

14:26.667 --> 14:28.875
TO READ
THE LUNCH SPECIALS.

14:28.875 --> 14:30.166
WELL, I'M SORRY.

14:30.166 --> 14:31.792
THANK YOU.

14:31.792 --> 14:35.000
DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU WERE SO DELICATE.

14:37.834 --> 14:39.458
HEY! YOU CAME BACK.

14:40.959 --> 14:42.208
JOEY, RIGHT,
FROM LAST NIGHT?

14:42.208 --> 14:44.041
YEAH.

14:44.041 --> 14:46.000
SO YOU DECIDED
THE GLAMOUR AND PRESTIGE

14:46.000 --> 14:47.792
OF WAITRESSING
WAS FOR YOU, AFTER ALL.

14:47.792 --> 14:51.208
WELL,
LET'S JUST SAY I'M
CURRENTLY RE-ALIGNING

14:51.208 --> 14:52.458
MY LIFE PRIORITIES.

14:52.458 --> 14:54.708
AND GETTING YOUR BUM
GRABBED BY A BUNCH
OF SADISTIC DRUNKS

14:54.708 --> 14:55.375
IS IN YOUR TOP 5.

14:55.375 --> 14:59.708
NO, BUT...

14:59.708 --> 15:02.041
I'M TRUSTING
MY INSTINCTS
FOR A CHANGE.

15:02.041 --> 15:02.959
SO, IS THE JOB
STILL AVAILABLE?

15:02.959 --> 15:05.458
YEAH. I'LL PUT A WORD IN
WITH THE MANAGER.

15:05.458 --> 15:09.667
OH, IN THE MEANTIME,
FILL THIS OUT.

15:09.667 --> 15:11.959
THANK YOU.
NO PROBLEM.

15:13.208 --> 15:14.708
HE DOESN'T EAT HERE
OFTEN, DOES HE?

15:14.708 --> 15:17.291
HIM? NOT PARTICULARLY, NO.

15:18.583 --> 15:20.917
OH, HE DOES WORK HERE.

15:20.917 --> 15:22.041
HE'S THE BARTENDER.

15:33.083 --> 15:35.917
SO, NO CLASSES
TODAY, EITHER?

15:35.917 --> 15:37.250
NO, I HAD TO SHOP,

15:37.250 --> 15:39.083
YOU KNOW,
FOR THE THING TONIGHT.

15:39.083 --> 15:40.083
OH, HONEY,
DON'T PUT THE--

15:40.083 --> 15:41.917
MMM. SOMETHING
SMELLS GOOD.

15:41.917 --> 15:43.083
HERE.
BON APPETIT.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.917
THAT'S OK.
SO, UH, WHAT'S
THE VERDICT, MAN?

15:44.917 --> 15:49.250
OH, MAN, I LOOKED AT
5 APARTMENTS THIS MORNING,

15:49.250 --> 15:50.959
LEADING ME TO THE INEVITABLE
CONCLUSION THAT EVERYTHING
IN OUR PRICE RANGE

15:50.959 --> 15:53.583
IS BOTH DISGUSTING
AND ROACH-INFESTED.

15:53.583 --> 15:56.208
EXCEPT FOR THIS PLACE
I LOOKED AT YESTERDAY.

15:56.208 --> 15:57.750
YEAH,
BUT IS IT CLEAN?

15:57.750 --> 15:59.250
IT'S IMMACULATE.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.291
WHEW.

16:01.291 --> 16:02.875
JACK, I'M SCANDALIZED.

16:02.875 --> 16:04.917
IS THAT AN OBVIOUSLY
GAY TRAIT THAT YOU'VE
JUST REVEALED TO US?

16:04.917 --> 16:07.333
HEY, I'M CLEAN.
ALL RIGHT? SUE ME.

16:07.333 --> 16:09.166
TRY LIVING WITH
SOMEONE'S GRANDMOTHER
FOR A FEW YEARS.

16:09.166 --> 16:09.959
THE SOLUTION HERE
IS REALLY OBVIOUS.

16:09.959 --> 16:12.458
WE GOTTA GO BACK.
WE GOTTA TRY AGAIN.

16:12.458 --> 16:15.375
WE HAVE TO CONVINCE
THIS WOMAN
OF WHY IT IS

16:15.375 --> 16:16.166
SHE WANTS TO LIVE
WITH THE TWO OF US.

16:16.166 --> 16:17.875
IF SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO LIVE WITH GUYS,

16:17.875 --> 16:19.750
SHE DOESN'T WANT
TO LIVE WITH GUYS.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.125
WHO CAN BLAME HER?
WHO WANTS TO DEAL WITH

16:21.125 --> 16:23.083
ALL THOSE LITTLE
SHAVING HAIRS IN THE SINK

16:23.083 --> 16:23.834
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING
TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH
IN THE MORNING? ECCH.

16:23.834 --> 16:26.208
HONEY, AS MUCH
AS I LOVE YOU,

16:26.208 --> 16:28.834
YOU'RE
MISSING THE POINT.
HE IS A NEAT GUY.

16:28.834 --> 16:29.917
THAT'S ONE WAY
OF PUTTING IT.

16:29.917 --> 16:32.792
AND YOU ARE A SLOB.
ADMIT IT, PACEY,

16:32.792 --> 16:34.500
YOU'RE NOT JUST A GUY,
YOU'RE A GUY'S GUY.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.250
OK, GRANTED,
YESTERDAY I MAY HAVE
BEEN A GUY'S GUY.

16:37.250 --> 16:40.291
TODAY, I AM A GUY
WITH A JOB.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.417
YOU GOT IT?
YEAH.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.250
YEAH.
CONGRATS, DUDE.

16:42.250 --> 16:43.333
WELL,
IT'S NOT SO MUCH
A JOB, REALLY,

16:43.333 --> 16:46.083
AS AN OPPORTUNITY
TO BECOME THE LOWEST
FORM OF LIFE,

16:46.083 --> 16:48.708
WHICH I'LL
EXPLAIN LATER,
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW

16:48.708 --> 16:50.166
WE HAVE AN APARTMENT
TO GET.

16:50.166 --> 16:51.500
MMM. WE?

16:51.500 --> 16:53.333
YES, WE. SWALLOW.

16:53.333 --> 16:55.417
HEH HEH HEH.

16:55.417 --> 16:57.458
HELLO. HI. I WAS, UM...

16:57.458 --> 17:00.667
I WAS WONDERING
IF I COULD COME LOOK
AT THE APARTMENT TODAY.

17:00.667 --> 17:03.000
NO, I THINK IT'S NICE.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.000
YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT EVERYBODY SAYS.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.875
"OH, YOU LIVE
WITH YOUR GRANDMA.
THAT'S SO SWEET."

17:09.875 --> 17:11.165
HOW DO THEY KNOW
I DON'T BEAT HER
WITH A STICK

17:11.165 --> 17:13.416
AND LEAVE HER TIED
TO THE RADIATOR ALL WINTER?

17:13.416 --> 17:14.040
IS THIS A CRY FOR HELP?

17:14.040 --> 17:16.666
DO I LOOK
LIKE I NEED HELP?

17:16.666 --> 17:17.458
NO. ACTUALLY,
YOU LOOK LIKE SOMEONE

17:17.458 --> 17:19.541
WHO'D PROBABLY
BE GOOD AT GIVING IT.

17:21.165 --> 17:21.500
OH, GOD.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.791
WHAT?

17:23.791 --> 17:25.625
OH, NO.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

17:25.625 --> 17:28.250
THIS IS MY FAULT.
THIS HAS HAPPENED
TO ME BEFORE.

17:28.250 --> 17:32.208
THIS RELIGION THING
IS NOT REALLY--GOD.

17:32.208 --> 17:36.542
NO! NOT GOD.
NOT GOD. I'M GONNA GO.

17:36.542 --> 17:38.792
WAIT, LOOK.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

17:38.792 --> 17:39.750
I DO WANT
SOMETHING FROM YOU.

17:39.750 --> 17:42.417
SEVERAL THINGS,
ACTUALLY.

17:42.417 --> 17:44.708
BUT, FIRST, I WANT YOU
TO SIT BACK DOWN.

17:44.708 --> 17:46.708
SSS...OK. I'LL PERCH.

17:46.708 --> 17:47.917
FINE.

17:47.917 --> 17:49.625
I'M NOT FULLY COMMITTED
TO THE SITTING.

17:49.625 --> 17:52.625
UNDERSTOOD. UM--

17:52.625 --> 17:54.375
I COULD LEAVE AT ANY MOMENT,
ESPECIALLY IF YOU CONTINUE

17:54.375 --> 17:55.458
TO NOT SAY ANYTHING.

17:55.458 --> 17:56.875
SORRY, IT'S--
THIS IS KIND OF
A DIFFICULT THING

17:56.875 --> 18:00.333
TO PHRASE PROPERLY.
UM...

18:00.333 --> 18:04.708
NO MATTER HOW I SAY IT,
I'M GONNA SOUND LIKE
A TOTAL DORK, SO...

18:04.708 --> 18:06.834
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD
OF THE STAND?

18:06.834 --> 18:08.750
BUH-BYE.

18:08.750 --> 18:09.834
W-WAIT A SECOND.
WAIT A SECOND.

18:09.834 --> 18:13.458
IT'S NOT A RELIGION.
IT'S A PEER
COUNSELING PROGRAM.

18:13.458 --> 18:14.458
YOU'RE SAYING YOU THINK
I NEED COUNSELING?

18:14.458 --> 18:18.708
NO. I'M SAYING
I THINK YOU COULD
GIVE COUNSELING.

18:18.708 --> 18:21.250
OH, YOU MEAN HELP PEOPLE.

18:21.250 --> 18:22.500
YEAH. LOOK,
ALL I'M ASKING

18:22.500 --> 18:23.583
IS THAT YOU COME
TO AN INFORMATION
SESSION TONIGHT.

18:23.583 --> 18:25.917
IT STARTS AT 7:00.

18:25.917 --> 18:27.083
AND YOU'LL BE THERE?

18:27.083 --> 18:28.542
YEAH, I'LL BE THERE.

18:41.125 --> 18:43.417
I THINK I MADE
A HUGE MISTAKE.

18:43.417 --> 18:45.250
EXCUSE ME?

18:45.250 --> 18:47.208
A WRONG TURN
OR SOMETHING.

18:47.208 --> 18:47.959
I MEAN, THIS CAN'T BE
THE PLACE I'M SUPPOSED
TO MEET YOU.

18:47.959 --> 18:50.959
THERE'S NO "HERE" HERE.

18:52.291 --> 18:53.375
WRONG AGAIN.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.041
WHAT IS THIS PLACE?

19:04.041 --> 19:05.333
THIS IS WHERE
WE'RE SHOOTING THE MOVIE.
WELL, MOST OF IT.

19:05.333 --> 19:08.125
ACTUALLY, DID I MENTION
IT TAKES PLACE
IN THE SEVENTIES?

19:08.125 --> 19:09.041
NO.

19:09.041 --> 19:09.959
YEAH.
A BUNCH OF TEENAGERS

19:09.959 --> 19:11.375
OBSESSED WITH
THE BOSTON STRANGER

19:11.375 --> 19:13.291
END UP SPENDING
THE WEEKEND AT THIS
OLD HOUSE IN CAPE COD,

19:13.291 --> 19:16.291
SCARING THE CRAP
OUT OF EACH OTHER,
OF COURSE.

19:16.291 --> 19:17.291
SOUNDS FAMILIAR.

19:17.291 --> 19:19.166
YEAH. ACTUALLY,
I'M REALLY PROUD OF THE SET.

19:19.166 --> 19:21.333
TODD LET ME
HAVE A LOT OF INPUT
INTO THE DESIGN.

19:21.333 --> 19:22.250
WHY IS THAT?

19:22.250 --> 19:24.333
BECAUSE I'M
A VALUED ASSISTANT.

19:24.333 --> 19:26.583
I SUSPECTED AS MUCH.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.166
AND HE DOESN'T TRUST
HIS PRODUCTION DESIGNER.

19:29.166 --> 19:31.333
A NOTORIOUSLY SHIFTY
RACE OF PEOPLE?

19:31.333 --> 19:33.250
AND HE SAYS
HE HAS NO FRIGGIN' IDEA

19:33.250 --> 19:35.041
WHAT A TYPICAL AMERICAN HOUSE
SHOULD LOOK LIKE.

19:35.041 --> 19:37.041
A TYPICAL
AMERICAN HOUSE?

19:49.125 --> 19:50.291
COME ON.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.375
DAWSON,
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.708
ALL THAT STUFF ABOUT
YOU CAN'T GO HOME AGAIN.

20:43.708 --> 20:44.375
YOU CAN.

20:44.375 --> 20:46.959
THROUGH
THE MAGIC OF MOVIES.

20:46.959 --> 20:49.083
ISN'T YOUR MOM
GONNA FREAK WHEN
SHE SEES YOUR HOUSE

20:49.083 --> 20:50.500
IN A HORROR MOVIE?

20:50.500 --> 20:52.667
HEH HEH. IT PROBABLY
WON'T BE TOO GOOD
FOR PROPERTY VALUES,

20:52.667 --> 20:53.917
BUT YOU GOT TO ADMIT
IT'S KIND OF COOL.

20:53.917 --> 20:57.708
IT'S MORE THAN COOL.

20:57.708 --> 20:59.417
DAWSON,
THIS IS SPECTACULAR.

20:59.417 --> 21:01.917
IT'S LIKE
IT'S YOUR MOVIE.

21:01.917 --> 21:03.208
WELL, EXCEPT IT'S NOT.

21:03.208 --> 21:04.625
I'M JUST THE DIRECTOR'S
ASSISTANT.

21:04.625 --> 21:06.750
COME ON, YOU
HAVE TO ADMIT YOU'VE
COME A LONG WAY

21:06.750 --> 21:08.250
SINCE SEA CREATURES
FROM THE DEEP.

21:08.250 --> 21:09.583
I MEAN...

21:11.500 --> 21:13.417
IT'S LIKE
IT'S THE REAL THING.

21:13.417 --> 21:17.291
AS REAL AS SOMETHING CAN BE
THAT'S ENTIRELY AN ILLUSION.

21:22.125 --> 21:23.417
ENTIRELY?

21:23.417 --> 21:24.542
WELL, SEE FOR YOURSELF.

21:33.667 --> 21:34.792
(CHUCKLES)

21:34.792 --> 21:37.166
YEAH. WE, UH...

21:37.166 --> 21:40.208
KIND OF
RAN OUT OF MONEY.

21:40.208 --> 21:41.417
HMM.

21:41.417 --> 21:42.792
LEERY,
YOU SICK BASTARD!

21:42.792 --> 21:44.166
HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE I TOLD YOU...

21:46.208 --> 21:48.583
HELLO, HELLO, HELLO.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.458
LEERY'S GOT A BIRD.

21:53.708 --> 21:55.083
OH, BOY.

21:59.291 --> 22:01.750
TODD, JOEY.
JOEY...TODD.

22:01.750 --> 22:02.792
HEY.

22:02.792 --> 22:04.708
HI.

22:04.708 --> 22:06.417
JOEY GOES
TO WORTHINGTON.

22:06.417 --> 22:07.917
WHAT'S THAT, LIKE
A COLLEGE OR SOMETHING?

22:07.917 --> 22:09.959
YEAH.

22:09.959 --> 22:11.792
NEVER HEARD OF IT.

22:11.792 --> 22:13.291
SO, WHAT DO YOU
THINK OF OUR SET?

22:13.834 --> 22:16.250
UM, IT'S AMAZING.

22:16.250 --> 22:17.208
IT WILL BE.
DO YOU STILL GOT
THAT LIST WE MADE

22:17.208 --> 22:18.542
OF ALL THE BLOODY THINGS
WRONG WITH IT?

22:18.542 --> 22:21.000
EVERY BLOODY ONE.
I ALREADY GOT
THE ART DEPARTMENT

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
STARTED
ON THE CORRECTIONS.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.125
EXCELLENT.

22:23.125 --> 22:25.417
WE'RE COMING BACK
AND FILMING
IN 2 WEEKS, YOU KNOW.

22:25.417 --> 22:27.166
THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.

22:27.166 --> 22:29.417
SO, YOU'LL, UH...

22:29.417 --> 22:31.000
YOU'LL COME BACK
AND VISIT US THEN,
THEN?

22:32.291 --> 22:34.291
I HOPE SO.

22:34.625 --> 22:35.625
OK.

22:35.625 --> 22:37.708
BYE.

22:40.333 --> 22:43.000
YOU'VE GIVING ME
THE BUM'S RUSH
OUT OF HERE, ISN'T YOU?

22:43.000 --> 22:44.166
IS THAT SO YOU CAN
TAKE THE NIGHT OFF

22:44.166 --> 22:45.708
AND GO FROLICKING
WITH THAT BIRD?

22:45.708 --> 22:46.834
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

22:46.834 --> 22:48.750
SO, WHAT TIME'S
THE CAR LEAVE FOR
THE AIRPORT TOMORROW?

22:48.750 --> 22:49.959
8:00.

22:49.959 --> 22:52.166
WAKE-UP CALL 7:30,
SECOND WAKE-UP CALL 7:45.

22:52.166 --> 22:54.208
RIGHT.

22:54.208 --> 22:55.542
SO, I'LL
SEE YOU THEN.

22:57.875 --> 23:01.667
GO GET 'EM, TIGER.

23:07.041 --> 23:09.667
WHOA. NICE PLACE.

23:09.667 --> 23:11.959
YEAH. YEAH, THIS
IS DEFINITELY THE ONE.

23:11.959 --> 23:13.542
ALL RIGHT,
SO WE'RE ALL CLEAR

23:13.542 --> 23:15.041
ON EXACTLY WHAT IT IS
THAT WE NEED
TO DO HERE, RIGHT?

23:15.041 --> 23:16.750
I DON'T KNOW.
IT MIGHT ACTUALLY
BE A LITTLE TOO NICE.

23:16.750 --> 23:18.458
AUDREY--
YES, CLEAR.

23:18.458 --> 23:20.333
AUDREY LIDDELL,
CHARACTER WITNESS
FOR THE DEFENSE.

23:20.333 --> 23:21.625
WHATEVER. HELLO?

23:22.500 --> 23:26.625
HI. I'M, UM,
I'M HERE ABOUT
THE APARTMENT.

23:26.625 --> 23:29.291
I REMEMBER YOU.
FOR YOURSELF?

23:29.291 --> 23:31.708
IN A WAY, YES.

23:31.708 --> 23:33.917
IN A WAY THAT
INVOLVES YOU LIVING HERE

23:33.917 --> 23:36.875
AND ME NEVER HAVING
TO SEE EITHER OF THESE
2 WASTRELS AGAIN

23:36.875 --> 23:38.125
FOR THE REST OF
MY NATURAL-BORN LIFE?

23:38.125 --> 23:40.250
NOT EXACTLY, NO.

23:40.250 --> 23:41.291
I'M AFRAID THERE'S BEEN
SOME SORT OF MISTAKE.

23:41.291 --> 23:43.750
WHOA, HEY.
JUST HOLD ON A SECOND HERE.

23:43.750 --> 23:45.375
YOU'RE NOT EVEN
GONNA LET THE WOMAN
SPEAK HER MIND?

23:45.375 --> 23:47.583
WELL, THE FACT
THAT SHE'S WITH YOU

23:47.583 --> 23:49.583
RAISES SERIOUS DOUBTS
AS TO WHETHER SHE HAS ONE.

23:49.583 --> 23:50.333
(SQUEAKS)

23:50.333 --> 23:52.625
LOOK, I JUST
WANT A SECOND CHANCE

23:52.625 --> 23:54.750
BECAUSE I OBVIOUSLY
DID NOT MAKE THE BEST

23:54.750 --> 23:56.125
FIRST IMPRESSION YESTERDAY,

23:56.125 --> 23:56.959
BUT I AM POSITIVE
THAT IF YOU DID

23:56.959 --> 23:59.041
GIVE ME A SECOND CHANCE,
I COULD SELL YOU

23:59.041 --> 24:01.542
ON THE OBVIOUS BENEFITS
OF LIVING WITH 2 FINE
YOUNG GENTLEMEN LIKE--

24:01.542 --> 24:02.959
YEAH, HI. UM...

24:02.959 --> 24:04.583
WE THOUGHT IT OVER
AND WE'LL TAKE IT.

24:06.583 --> 24:07.625
SORRY. IT'S TOO LATE.

24:10.166 --> 24:11.208
NICE TIE, BY THE WAY.

24:11.208 --> 24:14.500
OK, SO,
AS I WAS SAYING,

24:14.500 --> 24:15.959
MOST OF
WHAT WE DO AROUND HERE

24:15.959 --> 24:18.792
IS SIMPLY INFORMATION
AND REFERRALS.

24:18.792 --> 24:20.667
AND 99 TIMES OUT OF 100

24:20.667 --> 24:24.834
JUST REMINDING SOMEONE
TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH...

24:24.834 --> 24:25.959
(INHALES)

24:25.959 --> 24:28.834
AND TO KEEP ON BREATHING
IS ENOUGH.

24:28.834 --> 24:32.875
TOMORROW
WILL BE ANOTHER DAY,

24:32.875 --> 24:34.417
FOR YOU, TOO.

24:34.417 --> 24:38.959
WHICH BRINGS ME
TO OUR NUMBER ONE
RULE AROUND HERE:

24:38.959 --> 24:41.250
NEVER BE AFRAID
TO ASK FOR A HUG

24:41.250 --> 24:44.125
AT THE END
OF A TOUGH DAY.

24:54.500 --> 24:56.041
HEY, JEN!

24:57.291 --> 24:58.417
HI. YOU MADE IT.

24:58.417 --> 24:59.792
YEP. MADE IT.

24:59.792 --> 25:01.125
WELL, LET'S GO.
WE'RE LATE.

25:01.125 --> 25:03.875
YOU KNOW, I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T GO BACK IN THERE.

25:03.875 --> 25:05.125
BACK IN THERE?

25:05.125 --> 25:07.375
YEAH, I WAS
ALREADY IN THERE.

25:07.375 --> 25:10.375
I SAW THE POSTERS, THE--

25:10.375 --> 25:12.750
IT'S JUST--IT'S JUST
THAT IT'S NOT FOR ME--

25:12.750 --> 25:16.083
THE HUGGING
AND THE ONE DAY AT A TIME.

25:16.083 --> 25:17.750
OH, OK. I SEE.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.500
SO, YOU'RE ONE OF THOSE
PEOPLE WHO'VE FOUND
SOME OTHER WAY TO LIVE,

25:19.500 --> 25:21.708
ONE THAT DOESN'T INVOLVE
ONE DAY AT A TIME.

25:21.708 --> 25:23.166
LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO KNOCK YOUR SYSTEM.

25:23.166 --> 25:25.166
I'M SURE THAT IT'S
A REALLY GOOD SYSTEM, BUT--

25:25.166 --> 25:27.250
IT'S JUST NOT
COOL ENOUGH FOR YOU.
THAT'S FINE.

25:27.250 --> 25:28.667
NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

25:28.667 --> 25:30.000
I--I MEAN, HONESTLY,

25:30.000 --> 25:31.417
I THINK IT'S REALLY NICE
THAT YOU HAVE SOMETHING

25:31.417 --> 25:33.834
THAT YOU BELIEVE IN
LIKE THAT.

25:33.834 --> 25:34.834
YOU SAY THAT
LIKE IT'S A BAD THING.

25:34.834 --> 25:39.250
NO, IT--IT'S JUST
THAT I'M NOT MUCH
OF A JOINER.

25:39.250 --> 25:41.083
UM...

25:41.083 --> 25:43.834
IT WAS REALLY NICE
TO MEET YOU...

25:43.834 --> 25:47.500
AND GOOD LUCK,
AND...BYE.

25:50.458 --> 25:51.792
SO, THEN,
WHY DID YOU COME?

25:53.708 --> 25:55.750
UM...THAT'S
NOT OBVIOUS?

25:57.917 --> 26:00.208
FOR ARGUMENT'S SAKE,
LET'S SAY IT'S NOT.

26:02.041 --> 26:03.000
I MADE MYSELF THIS PROMISE
OVER THE SUMMER.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.125
WHAT WAS THAT?

26:04.125 --> 26:06.834
THAT, NO MATTER WHAT,

26:06.834 --> 26:10.417
I WOULD REALLY DO THINGS
DIFFERENTLY THIS YEAR,

26:10.417 --> 26:13.041
LIKE TRY TO MAKE
NEW FRIENDS AND STUFF,
AND I CAN'T DO THAT

26:13.041 --> 26:14.792
BY PRETENDING TO BE
SOMEBODY THAT I'M NOT,

26:14.792 --> 26:16.417
BECAUSE THEN THOSE FRIENDS
THAT I MAKE WOULD THINK

26:16.417 --> 26:18.917
THAT I'M SOMETHING
THAT I'M NOT.

26:18.917 --> 26:19.875
AND WHAT AREN'T YOU?

26:19.875 --> 26:23.542
WELL, FOR STARTERS,
I'M NOT AS GREAT AS A PERSON

26:23.542 --> 26:24.875
AS YOU THINK I AM.

26:24.875 --> 26:26.417
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD.

26:26.417 --> 26:29.792
IT WAS NICE TO MEET YOU.

26:29.792 --> 26:31.792
AND NO MATTER
WHAT HAPPENS THIS YEAR,

26:31.792 --> 26:32.208
I HOPE YOU DO ONE THING.

26:32.208 --> 26:33.500
WHAT'S THAT?

26:33.500 --> 26:36.542
CHANGE YOUR MIND
ABOUT YOURSELF.

26:48.875 --> 26:51.041
LISTEN, EMMA,
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO TAKE MY WORD FOR THIS,

26:51.041 --> 26:54.250
BUT LESBIANS ARE NOTORIOUS
FOR COMMITTING TOO SOON.

26:54.250 --> 26:55.834
YOU GIVE IT A WEEK,
THEY'RE GONNA BE SPLITSVILLE

26:55.834 --> 26:57.375
AND THROWING YOUR APPLIANCES
AT EACH OTHER.

26:57.375 --> 26:59.834
HOW DO YOU KNOW
I'M NOT GONNA BE THROWING
MY APPLIANCES AT YOU?

26:59.834 --> 27:02.542
AND, FOR THAT MATTER,
HOW DO YOU KNOW
I'M NOT A LESBIAN?

27:04.250 --> 27:06.250
THAT'S A GOOD POINT.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.291
AND YOU MAKE YOUR LIVING
SELLING PEOPLE STUFF.

27:08.291 --> 27:09.375
(CHUCKLES)

27:09.375 --> 27:10.583
IT'S JUST I--

27:10.583 --> 27:12.750
WHEN YOU STOP
AND THINK ABOUT THIS,

27:12.750 --> 27:14.000
YOU'RE GOING TO REALIZE

27:14.000 --> 27:15.750
THAT THE BENEFITS
TO LIVING
WITH THE TWO OF US

27:15.750 --> 27:17.291
FAR OUTWEIGH
THE DISADVANTAGES.

27:17.291 --> 27:19.083
SO LET'S JUST THINK
ABOUT IT FOR ONE SECOND,
SHALL WE?

27:19.083 --> 27:20.583
HOW IS IT
THAT 2 SCHLUBS LIKE US

27:20.583 --> 27:21.959
CAN AFFORD TO LIVE
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS,

27:21.959 --> 27:23.708
BECAUSE THE NEIGHBORHOOD
IS NOT THAT GREAT,
AM I RIGHT?

27:23.708 --> 27:25.500
I AM RIGHT, SO YOU
GOTTA GIVE GIVE ME
THAT ONE, RIGHT?

27:25.500 --> 27:26.625
LIVING WITH 2 GUYS,

27:26.625 --> 27:28.000
IT'S LIKE
HAVING FREE SECURITY.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.959
SECONDLY,
I AM A FANTASTIC COOK,

27:29.959 --> 27:31.458
AND I WILL
COOK YOU ANYTHING,
ANYTIME, ANYWHERE,

27:31.458 --> 27:33.458
BUT
THE PIECE DE RESISTANCE,

27:33.458 --> 27:34.875
AND WE DISCUSSED THIS
LAST NIGHT,

27:34.875 --> 27:36.708
I AM
A THOROUGHLY MONOGAMOUS,

27:36.708 --> 27:39.708
DOMESTICATED,
AMERICAN MALE

27:39.708 --> 27:41.625
WITH  A GIRLFRIEND,

27:41.625 --> 27:43.917
A STEADY GIRLFRIEND.

27:43.917 --> 27:45.083
YEAH, IT'S TRUE,
YOU KNOW,

27:45.083 --> 27:46.625
ABOUT THE COOKING,
ALTHOUGH...

27:46.625 --> 27:49.208
WE'LL PROBABLY ACTUALLY
BE BREAKING UP SOON,

27:49.208 --> 27:51.083
AND THEN GOD KNOWS
WHAT STRING OF HOS

27:51.083 --> 27:52.208
HE'LL HAVE RUNNING
THROUGH THIS JOINT,

27:52.208 --> 27:53.083
AND HE'S REALLY
NOISY, TOO,
(LAUGHS)

27:53.083 --> 27:55.500
ESPECIALLY WHEN HE'S,
UM, HAVING--
HONEY?

27:55.500 --> 27:56.875
HONEY.
DARLING.

27:56.875 --> 27:57.458
SWEETHEART?
YES.

27:57.458 --> 28:00.750
SIDEBAR.
SURE! EXCUSE ME.

28:03.667 --> 28:05.667
WELL, I MEAN,
YOU KNOW, IT'S
A PRETTY COOL PLACE...

28:05.667 --> 28:08.000
YEAH.
BUT SHE TOLD YOU ABOUT
THE--THE MICE PROBLEM,
RIGHT?

28:08.000 --> 28:09.625
OHH, GOD.
(CHUCKLES)

28:09.625 --> 28:11.875
THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA BE HELPING
ON THIS.

28:11.875 --> 28:13.125
I DIDN'T LIKE
THIS SITUATION LAST NIGHT,

28:13.125 --> 28:16.166
AND NOW THAT I SEE YOU
BANTERING BACK AND FORTH
WITH THAT GIRL,

28:16.166 --> 28:17.166
I LIKE IT EVEN LESS!

28:17.166 --> 28:18.375
THAT  GIRL?

28:19.417 --> 28:21.500
THAT GIRL HATES ME!

28:21.500 --> 28:22.750
I KNOW.

28:22.750 --> 28:24.208
SHE HATES YOU TOO MUCH.

28:24.208 --> 28:25.458
I DON'T TRUST IT!

28:25.458 --> 28:27.417
THANK YOU.
SURE, NO PROBLEM.
YEAH, ANYTIME. HEY!

28:27.417 --> 28:28.583
THANK YOU
VERY MUCH.
LET'S GO.

28:28.583 --> 28:30.667
HE--HEY--NO! HELLO!

28:30.667 --> 28:32.500
WAIT! PLEASE STOP.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.375
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
HELLO! HI!

28:34.375 --> 28:36.667
WAIT! WAIT! COME BACK!

28:39.166 --> 28:39.834
WHAT DID YOU SAY?

28:39.834 --> 28:41.875
OH, MY LOVE
FOR THIS APARTMENT

28:41.875 --> 28:43.875
KNOWS NO
ETHICAL BOUNDARIES.

28:53.250 --> 28:54.083
I'M SORRY THAT
TOOK SO LONG.

28:54.083 --> 28:56.125
OH.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.750
NO PROBLEM.

28:57.750 --> 28:58.208
SO, I WAS
THINKING...

28:58.208 --> 29:00.041
MMM.

29:00.041 --> 29:01.917
ALWAYS A DANGEROUS
PROPOSITION.
YEAH.

29:01.917 --> 29:04.667
I'M THINKING I WANNA
TAKE YOU OUT TONIGHT.

29:04.667 --> 29:07.083
FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY,
OFFICIALLY.

29:07.083 --> 29:08.959
IF YOU DON'T
HAVE OTHER PLANS.

29:08.959 --> 29:10.083
WELL, (LAUGHS)

29:10.083 --> 29:11.750
CONSIDERING NO ONE ELSE
EVEN REMEMBERED MY BIRTHDAY,

29:11.750 --> 29:14.333
I CAN'T IMAGINE
ANY OTHER PLANS
I WOULD HAVE.

29:14.333 --> 29:16.750
BUT, DAWSON, I'D KINDA
LIKE TO CHANGE FIRST. I--

29:19.083 --> 29:22.625
I THOUGHT MAYBE WE
COULD HAVE A, UH,
DRINK BEFORE DINNER.

29:26.625 --> 29:28.208
KINDA HOKEY,
DON'T YOU THINK?

29:28.208 --> 29:30.625
YEAH, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I THINK.

29:33.083 --> 29:34.708
YOU PUT A LITTLE
THOUGHT INTO THIS.

29:34.708 --> 29:36.500
JUST A LITTLE.

29:36.500 --> 29:37.625
WHOA!

29:37.625 --> 29:39.250
THERE MUST BE,
LIKE, $100 WORTH

29:39.250 --> 29:40.208
OF STUFF IN HERE.

29:40.208 --> 29:41.917
MMM, IT'S PROBABLY
MORE LIKE, 200.

29:41.917 --> 29:42.875
"DEAR TODD, THANKS
FOR CHOOSING US.

29:42.875 --> 29:46.166
WE LOOK FORWARD
TO PROCESSING
YOUR DAILIES"?

29:46.166 --> 29:48.083
CHAMPAGNE?

29:48.083 --> 29:52.708
DAWSON, ISN'T
SATAN GONNA NOTICE
THAT THIS IS GONE?

29:52.708 --> 29:54.291
(POP)

29:54.291 --> 29:56.125
YOU KNOW HOW MANY GIFT BASKETS
A HOLLYWOOD DIRECTOR GETS

29:56.125 --> 29:57.375
BEFORE HE STARTS
A NEW PRODUCTION?

29:58.959 --> 30:00.083
HOW MANY?

30:00.083 --> 30:01.625
A LOT.

30:07.083 --> 30:08.667
A TOAST.

30:10.458 --> 30:11.458
TO JOEY POTTER...

30:11.458 --> 30:13.625
ON HER 19th BIRTHDAY,

30:13.625 --> 30:15.375
A DAY THAT
WILL LIVE IN INFAMY.

30:15.375 --> 30:17.917
A GREAT DAY.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.667
AND ONE THAT
HASN'T ENDED YET.

30:49.166 --> 30:50.375
IT'S LATE, ISN'T IT?

30:50.375 --> 30:51.500
MMM.

30:51.500 --> 30:52.959
GUESS WE SORT OF
LOST TRACK OF TIME.

30:52.959 --> 30:54.500
YEAH, IN A GOOD WAY.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.875
MEANING?

30:55.875 --> 30:57.083
TIME'S
THE ENEMY, RIGHT?

30:57.083 --> 30:57.625
OUR ENEMY?

30:57.625 --> 30:59.667
MMM, YOU'RE NOT PLANNING

30:59.667 --> 31:00.792
ON TURNING INTO
A PUMPKIN AT MIDNIGHT?

31:00.792 --> 31:03.959
NO, BUT I AM
LEAVING TOMORROW.

31:06.417 --> 31:07.708
AND THEN WHAT?

31:07.708 --> 31:09.583
AND THEN I COME BACK.

31:09.583 --> 31:12.250
BACK TO WHAT, EXACTLY?

31:12.250 --> 31:14.208
TO US.

31:23.375 --> 31:24.959
(CELL PHONE RINGS)

31:24.959 --> 31:26.041
DO YOU HEAR SOMETHING?

31:26.041 --> 31:27.041
NOPE.

31:32.333 --> 31:33.875
YOU SHOULD ANSWER
THAT, YOU KNOW.

31:33.875 --> 31:35.625
WHY?
BECAUSE YOU LOVE
THAT JOB.

31:35.625 --> 31:39.417
(SIGHS AND LAUGHS)

31:42.333 --> 31:44.291
NOT HIM.

31:46.041 --> 31:46.708
YOU'RE LYING.
NO, I'M NOT.

31:46.708 --> 31:49.333
DAWSON, YES, YOU ARE.
I'M NOT.

31:55.458 --> 31:57.208
WHA--

31:57.208 --> 31:58.417
HEY, JOEY!

31:58.417 --> 32:00.291
WHAT--GIV--GIVE ME--
(LAUGHS)

32:02.583 --> 32:04.000
WHO'S THE GIRL?
JOEY...

32:04.000 --> 32:06.875
NO, WHO'S THE GIRL
CALLING YOUR CELL PHONE?

32:06.875 --> 32:07.542
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

32:07.542 --> 32:09.375
NO, TELL ME.
WHO IS IT?

32:09.375 --> 32:10.291
NOBODY.

32:10.291 --> 32:11.959
OH, NOBODY.
THAT'S INTERESTING
BECAUSE SHE--

32:11.959 --> 32:14.917
SHE'S A FRIEND.
SHE'S A--SOME FRIEND
FROM L.A.

32:14.917 --> 32:16.083
WELL, FIRST
SHE'S NOBODY,
AND NOW SHE'S A FRIEND.

32:16.083 --> 32:17.667
WHICH IS IT, DAWSON?
SHE'S JUST A GIRL.

32:17.667 --> 32:20.125
SHE'S A GIRL
I'VE BEEN KIND OF SEEING.

32:20.125 --> 32:21.250
HI!

32:21.250 --> 32:24.083
UM, ARE YOU GUYS
GONNA STAND OUT HERE
ALL NIGHT?

32:24.083 --> 32:25.041
BECAUSE, UM,
WE'RE TRYING--

32:25.041 --> 32:26.291
NOT VERY SUCCESSFULLY,
MIND YOU--

32:26.291 --> 32:28.208
TO THROW YOU
A SURPRISE PARTY.

32:33.417 --> 32:34.542
HEY, SURPRISE!

32:34.542 --> 32:37.417
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

32:37.417 --> 32:40.125
(GIGGLES)

32:40.125 --> 32:42.542
YOU HATE IT,
DON'T YOU?

32:42.542 --> 32:43.792
NO!

32:43.792 --> 32:45.959
(APPLAUDS)

32:45.959 --> 32:47.625
LUCKY ME!

32:53.875 --> 32:54.959
DO YOU LOVE IT?

32:54.959 --> 32:56.750
I GOT IT AT FRED SEGAL,
SO YOU CAN'T RETURN IT

32:56.750 --> 32:58.083
EVEN IF YOU DON'T,
BUT NOT THAT YOU WOULD

32:58.083 --> 33:00.500
BECAUSE IT'S TOTALLY
STUNNING AND EVERYTHING!

33:00.500 --> 33:01.959
I LOVE IT, AUDREY.
IT'S GREAT.

33:01.959 --> 33:03.959
IT'S JUST WHAT
I WANTED. THANK YOU.

33:03.959 --> 33:05.750
YOU'RE WELCOME!

33:05.750 --> 33:07.500
JOEY, IS
SOMETHING WRONG?

33:07.500 --> 33:08.708
OH, NO!

33:08.708 --> 33:11.208
GOD, NO, I--

33:11.208 --> 33:12.708
WOW, IT--

33:13.834 --> 33:15.959
EXCUSE ME FOR A SECOND.

33:19.875 --> 33:20.834
(DOOR SLAMS)

33:20.834 --> 33:22.125
YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?!

33:22.125 --> 33:25.667
I SLEPT WITH YOU LAST NIGHT,
AND YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND?

33:25.667 --> 33:28.000
THIS IS A VERY
UNHAPPY BIRTHDAY.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.375
Dawson: I DIDN'T
SAY THAT. I SAID
I'D BEEN SEEING SOMEONE.

33:29.375 --> 33:31.959
SEEING SOMEONE!
WHAT THE HELL DOES
THAT MEAN, DAWSON?!

33:31.959 --> 33:33.166
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT THE POINT IS, JOEY,
I BROKE UP WITH HER

33:33.166 --> 33:36.166
THE SECOND SOMETHING
HAPPENED BETWEEN US.
HOW?!

33:36.166 --> 33:37.333
HOW, IN YOUR MIND?!

33:37.333 --> 33:38.333
THE FIRST THING
THIS MORNING.

33:38.333 --> 33:39.625
WHERE DO YOU THINK
I WENT WHEN I LEFT?

33:39.625 --> 33:40.417
I THOUGHT YOU WENT OUT
FOR BREAKFAST!

33:40.417 --> 33:42.041
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
GETTING UP EARLY

33:42.041 --> 33:43.250
TO GO BREAK UP
WITH SOMEONE ELSE!

33:43.250 --> 33:45.250
WELL, WOULD YOU
RATHER I DIDN'T?
NO!

33:45.250 --> 33:47.333
I WOULD RATHER YOU WEREN'T
INVOLVED WITH SOMEONE

33:47.333 --> 33:48.166
WHEN WE FINALLY
SLEEP TOGETHER!

33:48.166 --> 33:50.708
JOEY, I'M SORRY IF THIS
RUINS THE FANTASY,

33:50.708 --> 33:52.166
BUT THIS GIRL
MEANS NOTHING

33:52.166 --> 33:54.166
TO ME COMPARED TO YOU--
YOU SHOULD'VE TOLD ME!

33:54.166 --> 33:55.750
WHEN? WHERE?
BEFORE!

33:55.750 --> 33:57.000
JOEY, STOP!

33:58.125 --> 33:59.083
WHY? WHY STOP NOW?

33:59.083 --> 34:01.834
EVERYONE HERE WHO THINKS
DAWSON SHOULD'VE TOLD ME

34:01.834 --> 34:03.333
HE HAD A GIRLFRIEND
BEFORE HE DECIDED

34:03.333 --> 34:05.333
TO SLEEP WITH ME,
RAISE YOUR HAND.

34:08.375 --> 34:10.000
YOU'RE BLOWING THIS
WAY OUT OF PROPORTION.

34:10.000 --> 34:11.792
Jack: UH--UH, OK,
MAYBE YOU GUYS SHOULD, UH,

34:11.792 --> 34:12.875
JUST TAKE A BREATHER
FOR A MOMENT, LET
COOLER HEADS PREVAIL?

34:12.875 --> 34:15.833
OR WE COULD JUST LEAVE.

34:15.833 --> 34:16.542
Jack: UH,
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.
LET'S GO.

34:16.542 --> 34:18.667
UH, NO, I CAN'T.

34:18.667 --> 34:19.750
HONEY, NOW'S
NOT THE TIME.

34:19.750 --> 34:22.000
I'M SORRY. I KNOW
THAT DAWSON'S
OUR FRIEND, TOO,

34:22.000 --> 34:23.667
BUT I PERSONALLY
CANNOT LEAVE
UNTIL JOEY SAYS IT'S OK.

34:23.667 --> 34:26.291
IT'S FINE, AUDREY.

34:26.291 --> 34:27.208
OK, GOOD.

34:29.375 --> 34:31.208
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, JO.

34:31.208 --> 34:33.291
THEY ARE GONNA RIP
EACH OTHER'S HEADS OFF.

34:33.291 --> 34:34.333
LET'S JUST GO.

34:35.875 --> 34:38.333
WE DIDN'T TALK AT ALL
THIS SUMMER,

34:38.333 --> 34:40.250
WHICH WAS YOUR CHOICE
AS MUCH AS IT WAS MINE.

34:40.250 --> 34:41.417
SO I ASKED YOU
TO LIE TO ME?

34:41.417 --> 34:43.708
JOEY, YOU AND I
BOTH KNOW

34:43.708 --> 34:45.375
IF EITHER ONE OF US
HAD STOPPED AND THOUGHT

34:45.375 --> 34:46.250
FOR EVEN A SECOND
LAST NIGHT,

34:46.250 --> 34:49.417
THEN WHAT WE DID NEVER
WOULD HAVE HAPPENED,

34:49.417 --> 34:51.250
AND I FOR ONE AM NOT
SORRY THAT IT DID.

34:51.250 --> 34:52.250
IF YOU ARE,
THEN THAT'S--

34:52.250 --> 34:53.917
THAT'S A COMPLETELY
SEPARATE ARGUMENT.

34:53.917 --> 34:55.417
THAT'S ACTUALLY A MUCH
BIGGER DEAL THAN--

34:55.417 --> 34:57.083
DAWSON, YOU HAVE
A GIRLFRIEND!

34:57.083 --> 34:57.750
HOW IS THAT
NOT A BIG DEAL?

34:57.750 --> 35:00.250
HAD  A GIRLFRIEND, JOEY.

35:00.250 --> 35:01.417
AND, LOOK,
I'M WILLING TO ADMIT

35:01.417 --> 35:03.542
THAT THE TIMING ON THIS
IS FAR FROM PERFECT,

35:03.542 --> 35:05.125
BUT I'M SICK OF WAITING
FOR THIS SO-CALLED
PERFECT TIMING

35:05.125 --> 35:07.542
THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NEVER
GONNA HAPPEN FOR US.

35:07.542 --> 35:08.625
OH, YEAH, RIGHT.
YOU KNOW, IT'S...

35:08.625 --> 35:10.834
BETTER TO JUST GET IT
OVER WITH AND MOVE ON,
YOU KNOW?

35:10.834 --> 35:13.500
"SLEPT WITH JOEY. JUST...

35:13.500 --> 35:15.000
CROSS THAT OFF MY LIST
OF THINGS TO DO."

35:15.000 --> 35:16.583
YOU KNOW THAT'S
NOT HOW I THINK.

35:16.583 --> 35:19.083
HOW DO I KNOW THAT,
DAWSON? I HAVEN'T TALKED
TO YOU ALL SUMMER.

35:19.083 --> 35:20.041
APPARENTLY
YOU'VE CHANGED SO MUCH
THAT YOU'RE WILLING--

35:20.041 --> 35:22.417
YOU REALLY THINK
I'D WANNA SLEEP WITH YOU

35:22.417 --> 35:23.834
AND NOT WANT IT
TO MEAN MORE, JOEY?

35:23.834 --> 35:25.041
YOU THINK I'VE BEEN
WAITING ALL THESE YEARS

35:25.041 --> 35:26.041
FOR US TO HAVE
ONE NIGHT TOGETHER

35:26.041 --> 35:26.959
AND THEN GO
OUR SEPARATE WAYS?

35:26.959 --> 35:29.625
OH, I'M SORRY YOU GOT
SICK OF WAITING, DAWSON.

35:29.625 --> 35:31.792
I'M SORRY THAT
I WANTED OUR FIRST TIME

35:31.792 --> 35:32.417
TO MEAN SOMETHING
MORE THAN JUST--

35:32.417 --> 35:34.291
IT DOES MEAN MORE,
JOEY! IT--

35:34.291 --> 35:36.708
I MEAN, IT--IT
MEANS EVERYTHING

35:36.708 --> 35:38.375
TO ME. I--

35:38.375 --> 35:39.917
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS TO YOU.

35:39.917 --> 35:41.166
OH, YOU'RE SAYING THAT
I WANTED THIS TO HAPPEN?

35:41.166 --> 35:43.125
NO, 'CAUSE THAT WOULD
INVOLVE YOU ACTUALLY
KNOWING WHAT YOU WANT,

35:43.125 --> 35:45.792
WHICH WE BOTH KNOW
IS NOT LIKELY

35:45.792 --> 35:46.792
TO HAPPEN ANYTIME
THIS DECADE.

35:46.792 --> 35:48.500
OH, GREAT, YOU KNOW?

35:48.500 --> 35:50.500
USE SOMETHING I SAID
WHEN I WAS A CHILD!

35:50.500 --> 35:52.959
YOU'RE STILL
A CHILD, JOEY.

35:52.959 --> 35:55.417
YOU'RE STILL THE SAME
SCARED LITTLE GIRL
WHO--

35:55.417 --> 35:56.834
WHO WHAT?

35:58.583 --> 36:00.708
WHO WHAT, DAWSON?

36:00.708 --> 36:01.417
WHO BROKE YOUR HEART?

36:03.417 --> 36:05.625
GOD! IS THE STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS

36:05.625 --> 36:07.417
EVER GONNA END
ON THAT ONE? EVER?!

36:07.417 --> 36:10.875
DAWSON, I'M SORRY I DON'T
HAVE THE SAME DREAMS I HAD

36:10.875 --> 36:12.166
WHEN I WAS 15 YEARS OLD,

36:12.166 --> 36:15.041
AND I'M SORRY THAT I MOVED
ON FASTER THAN YOU DID,

36:15.041 --> 36:16.125
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:16.125 --> 36:19.333
MAYBE NOT EVERYTHING THAT
HAPPENS TO YOU IS MY FAULT!

36:19.333 --> 36:21.834
AND MAYBE JUST BECAUSE I
WANT MORE FROM MY LIFE THAN--

36:21.834 --> 36:24.250
MORE THAN WHAT?
MORE THAN US?

36:25.917 --> 36:28.166
YOU DON'T KNOW, DO YOU?

36:28.166 --> 36:30.375
YOU'VE NEVER KNOWN.

36:30.375 --> 36:31.834
THE ENTIRE TIME
I'VE KNOWN YOU,
ALL YOU'VE WANTED

36:31.834 --> 36:33.041
TO DO IS ESCAPE.

36:33.041 --> 36:34.875
FROM ME, FROM CAPESIDE.

36:34.875 --> 36:35.959
I MEAN, YOU SAY
THAT I'M THE DREAMER.

36:35.959 --> 36:38.375
I'M THE ONE
WHO DOESN'T WANNA LIVE
IN THE REAL WORLD.

36:38.375 --> 36:41.417
WELL, I'M DOING IT,
JOEY.

36:41.417 --> 36:43.000
RIGHT NOW. I'M LIVING
IN THE REAL WORLD.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.166
IT'S YOU
WHO WANTS THE FANTASY.

36:45.166 --> 36:46.917
I WANT THE FANTASY?

36:46.917 --> 36:48.166
YES.

36:48.166 --> 36:50.000
WHO LIT THE CANDLES?

36:50.000 --> 36:51.041
WHO BOUGHT THE CHAMPAGNE?

36:51.041 --> 36:51.875
WHO DUMPED WHO
4 YEARS AGO?

36:51.875 --> 36:54.708
JOEY, I KNOW
WHAT I WANT.

36:54.708 --> 36:57.500
I'VE ALWAYS KNOWN
WHAT I WANT.

36:57.500 --> 37:00.834
BEFORE WE DESTROY
WHATEVER CHANCE
WE MIGHT ACTUALLY HAVE

37:00.834 --> 37:01.834
AT HAVING
A RELATIONSHIP,

37:01.834 --> 37:05.708
I'M ASKING YOU, PLEASE,

37:05.708 --> 37:07.417
STOP AND THINK
ABOUT THIS.

37:07.417 --> 37:09.959
IS THIS REALLY WHAT
YOU WANT? IS THIS...

37:09.959 --> 37:11.375
REALLY THE WAY

37:11.375 --> 37:12.917
THAT YOU WANT THINGS
TO END BETWEEN US?

37:17.875 --> 37:19.375
THEY DO THIS
ALL THE TIME, RIGHT?
NO BIG WHOOP.

37:19.375 --> 37:22.125
I MEAN, IT'S NORMAL
TO FIGHT. IT'S HEALTHY.

37:22.125 --> 37:24.333
OOH, I DON'T KNOW
IF HEALTHY'S
THE WORD I WOULD USE

37:24.333 --> 37:25.875
TO DESCRIBE
THEIR RELATIONSHIP.

37:25.875 --> 37:27.750
I MEAN, I'M
ALL FOR "WILL THEY,
WON'T THEY"

37:27.750 --> 37:29.083
FINALLY GETTING
THEIR SHOT,

37:29.083 --> 37:31.375
BUT FOR 2 PEOPLE
TO BE THAT DEPENDENT
ON EACH OTHER

37:31.375 --> 37:32.000
FOR THEIR LIFE'S
HAPPINESS IS JUST--

37:32.000 --> 37:34.333
INCREDIBLY ROMANTIC?

37:34.333 --> 37:36.083
OR PERHAPS
STRUCTURALLY UNSOUND?

37:36.083 --> 37:38.583
YEAH, I'LL SECOND THAT.

37:38.583 --> 37:41.250
WHOA, WAIT A SECOND.
ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE COMING OUT

37:41.250 --> 37:43.417
AS SOME SORT OF NONBELIEVER?

37:43.417 --> 37:45.875
HEY, LET'S NOT FORGET
WHO BROKE THEM UP
THE FIRST TIME AROUND.

37:45.875 --> 37:47.834
OOH!

37:47.834 --> 37:49.917
JEN?

37:49.917 --> 37:51.250
OH, DON'T LOOK AT ME.
I'M TOO FAR MESSED UP

37:51.250 --> 37:54.000
IN THIS THING
TO HAVE AN OPINION.

37:54.000 --> 37:55.166
I AM JUST THE ROAD KILL

37:55.166 --> 37:56.875
ON THE DAWSON
AND JOEY HIGHWAY.

37:56.875 --> 37:57.375
(LAUGHS)

37:59.750 --> 38:01.750
OK...

38:01.750 --> 38:04.917
4 INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE
SOFT DRINKS.

38:04.917 --> 38:06.959
THANKS.
THANK YOU.

38:06.959 --> 38:08.417
CAN I GET YOU LOT
ANYTHING ELSE?

38:09.667 --> 38:12.083
DIDN'T THINK SO.

38:12.083 --> 38:12.750
UH, EMMA,

38:12.750 --> 38:15.041
HOLD ON A SEC.

38:15.834 --> 38:17.333
YES?

38:17.333 --> 38:19.792
LISTEN, I, UH, JUST
WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR THIS AFTERNOON--

38:19.792 --> 38:20.667
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

38:20.667 --> 38:21.959
EXCUSE ME?

38:21.959 --> 38:24.500
THE FLAT.
YOU CAN HAVE IT.

38:24.500 --> 38:27.750
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE
YOUR LITTLE FRIEND THERE
THE SATISFACTION,

38:27.750 --> 38:29.750
BUT HE WAS RIGHT
ABOUT THE SECURITY.

38:29.750 --> 38:32.125
THE NEIGHBORS GOT BROKEN
INTO TWICE LAST YEAR.

38:32.125 --> 38:35.333
SO, IF YOU LIKE, YOU CAN
MOVE IN AT THE WEEKEND.

38:37.625 --> 38:38.750
YOU WILL NOT
REGRET THIS.

38:40.792 --> 38:42.458
OH, YES, I WILL.

38:42.458 --> 38:42.834
(CHUCKLES)

38:42.834 --> 38:45.000
THANK YOU.

38:50.625 --> 38:51.959
SO WHAT DID SHE SAY?

38:54.500 --> 38:56.417
WE'RE MOVING IN
THIS WEEKEND.

38:56.417 --> 38:58.542
SERIOUSLY?

38:58.542 --> 39:00.250
YES! GRR!

39:00.250 --> 39:02.834
OK, I SUPPOSE A TOAST
IS IN ORDER,

39:02.834 --> 39:04.166
THOUGH WHY
I SHOULD BE TOASTING

39:04.166 --> 39:05.625
TO YOU LEAVING ME
ALL ALONE AT GRAMS'
IS BEYOND ME.

39:08.125 --> 39:09.667
YEAH, AND I DON'T
REALLY THINK I SHOULD
CELEBRATE SOMETHING

39:09.667 --> 39:13.417
THAT COULD BE
THE DEATH KNELL
OF MY RELATIONSHIP.

39:13.417 --> 39:14.458
WELL, WE'RE IN A BIT
OF A BIND THEN,

39:14.458 --> 39:15.542
'CAUSE WE DO
NEED A TOAST.

39:15.542 --> 39:16.083
WELL, UH...

39:16.083 --> 39:17.875
TO FRIENDSHIP THEN.

39:17.875 --> 39:18.959
TO FRIENDSHIP.

39:18.959 --> 39:19.959
TO FRIENDSHIPS.

39:19.959 --> 39:21.458
TO FRIENDSHIP.

39:21.458 --> 39:23.041
(AUDREY LAUGHS)

39:30.333 --> 39:32.125
(SIGHS)

39:33.000 --> 39:35.458
(CRYING)

39:57.041 --> 39:57.542
(SIGHS)

40:11.500 --> 40:13.333
WHAT TIME'S
YOUR FLIGHT?

40:13.333 --> 40:15.792
10:00.

40:15.792 --> 40:17.708
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
ALLOW EXTRA TIME--

40:17.708 --> 40:19.166
I WILL.

40:30.000 --> 40:32.250
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS, JOEY?

40:32.250 --> 40:36.500
WE'RE DOING THIS,
DAWSON.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.583
IT'S WHAT WE DO.
IT'S WHAT WE ALWAYS DO.

40:38.583 --> 40:42.208
LAST NIGHT WAS REAL.

40:42.208 --> 40:43.792
TODAY WAS REAL.

40:43.792 --> 40:45.500
IT'S YOU, NOT ME,

40:45.500 --> 40:48.000
WHO DOESN'T WANNA DEAL
WITH THE REALITIES

40:48.000 --> 40:49.083
OF AN ADULT RELATIONSHIP.

40:50.291 --> 40:52.208
YOU'RE RIGHT.

40:53.250 --> 40:55.792
THAT'S IT? I'M RIGHT?

40:55.792 --> 40:57.208
I WANT THE FANTASY.

40:57.208 --> 40:59.250
I WANT MORE
THAN ANYTHING

40:59.250 --> 41:02.000
FOR US
TO BE TOGETHER.

41:03.750 --> 41:04.542
BUT NOT LIKE THIS.

41:04.542 --> 41:07.583
NOT SCREAMING
AT THE TOP OF OUR LUNGS

41:07.583 --> 41:09.834
ABOUT THINGS THAT
HAPPENED 4 YEARS AGO.

41:09.834 --> 41:11.208
BUT IF WE CAN'T
ARGUE LIKE THIS

41:11.208 --> 41:12.542
AND GET PAST IT, THEN...

41:12.542 --> 41:16.250
MAYBE THERE'S NOTHING
HERE WORTH SAVING.

41:18.458 --> 41:22.625
MAYBE LAST NIGHT
WAS JUST...

41:22.625 --> 41:24.583
JUST WHAT?

41:24.583 --> 41:26.792
JUST 2 OLD FRIENDS
MAKING A HUGE MISTAKE.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.667
WOW.

41:38.625 --> 41:39.959
IF THAT'S THE WAY
YOU FEEL, THEN--THEN I...

41:39.959 --> 41:41.625
SHOULD GO.

42:56.083 --> 42:57.917
(SIGHS)
