00:20.700 --> 00:22.600
Oh! Good night.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.400
Good night.

00:54.300 --> 00:56.500
[Gasps]

01:01.300 --> 01:04.900
- [Screams]
- How long did you know I was there?

01:04.900 --> 01:07.800
Oh. Just since the lobby.

01:07.800 --> 01:10.800
But that popping up behind me
was really scary. Look.

01:10.800 --> 01:13.000
<i>- I dropped my papers.</i>
- Nice touch.

01:13.000 --> 01:16.600
- Thanks.
- I'd give you a hand with that, but, uh...

01:18.200 --> 01:20.700
Oh. Still no interaction.

01:20.700 --> 01:23.200
Not a twinge.
Can't spirit the knickknacks about.

01:23.200 --> 01:26.300
Can't willie the locals.
Bloody sad ghost I turned out.

01:26.300 --> 01:28.600
I've told you before.
You're not a ghost.

01:28.600 --> 01:30.600
Chipper!
Give us a hug.

01:30.600 --> 01:35.000
You know what I mean. You're more
than a common spectral disturbance.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.500
I've never seen anything like you.

01:37.500 --> 01:40.900
<i>- [Beeping]</i>
- Bet you say that to all the spirits.

01:42.400 --> 01:46.700
Oh. Your radiant heat signature's
dropped another.02 degrees.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.600
Thought it was a bit nippy.

01:50.300 --> 01:54.100
Is, uh, everything...
Are you...

01:54.100 --> 01:56.300
Feeling the tug
of eternal damnation?

01:57.900 --> 02:00.600
<i>Maybe that's why</i>
<i>I can't touch anything.</i>

02:00.600 --> 02:04.500
- Using all my mentalies just to
keep from slipping into hell.
- I won't let that happen.

02:04.800 --> 02:08.600
I've been working on a theory.
Well, more of a hunch, actually.

02:08.900 --> 02:12.200
- But I think I'm getting close.
- To making me a real boy again?

02:12.200 --> 02:14.800
[Chuckles] As real as
a vampire with a soul can be.

02:14.800 --> 02:18.800
- It won't be like Angel's
thing with the prophecy, but...
- What prophecy?

02:18.900 --> 02:22.900
The "Shan-shoe-ha"
something or another.

02:22.900 --> 02:26.700
It says that if Angel helps enough people,
he gets to be human again.

02:26.700 --> 02:28.500
Oh. Really?

02:29.900 --> 02:32.000
Goody for him.

02:32.000 --> 02:35.000
- Ahh! That totally makes sense!
- What does?

02:35.000 --> 02:37.200
The fluctuations in your readings.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.600
<i>A lack of particle cohesion.</i>

02:39.600 --> 02:43.600
L-It's almost as if your essence
is straddling a dimensional void.

02:43.600 --> 02:46.900
Which may be the key, assuming that
the amulet you used to save the world...

02:46.900 --> 02:49.500
is some sort of trans-reality amplifier...

02:49.500 --> 02:52.600
capable of focusing massive quantities
of mystical energy.

02:52.600 --> 02:56.300
And what in the King's English does
that mean to the dearly almost departed?

02:56.300 --> 03:00.300
<i>It means that if I can defy</i>
<i>most of the laws of nature...</i>

03:00.300 --> 03:03.600
there's a good chance I'll be able to anchor
you to this plane and make you corporeal.

03:06.300 --> 03:09.600
Well, might be a hug
in your future after all.

03:12.700 --> 03:15.200
Spike?

03:15.200 --> 03:17.000
[Grunts]

03:22.600 --> 03:25.400
[Chuckles]
Brilliant.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.800
<i>[Ripping, Chopping]</i>

03:42.700 --> 03:45.700
<i>[Sound Continues]</i>

03:50.800 --> 03:52.400
<i>[Clears Throat]</i>

03:52.400 --> 03:55.100
Don't mean to interrupt the sitting
in a dark basement, mate...

03:55.100 --> 03:57.400
but could you point
the quickest way back to the lab?

03:57.400 --> 03:59.300
As the ghost flies, l...

04:10.200 --> 04:12.400
I'll take that as a "No" then.

05:03.900 --> 05:06.300
<i>Bubbe,</i> I negotiated that deal
with my own two horns.

05:06.300 --> 05:08.300
Second billing,
right after Gwyneth. Yeah.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.200
No, no, stop crying.
Stop crying.

05:10.200 --> 05:12.400
It's okay you put on
a couple of pounds since casting.

05:12.400 --> 05:16.200
Yeah, they can't just...
No, no, no. Just put the pills down.

05:16.200 --> 05:19.100
I'll straighten this out.
If I can't, I'll take a handful myself.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.200
I need these as soon as possible.

05:29.200 --> 05:31.100
"Hello, Wesley.
Nice to see you."

05:31.100 --> 05:34.500
Oh, sorry.
Little preoccupied.

05:35.800 --> 05:38.900
<i>"The Magdalene Grimoire,</i>
<i>Necronomicon des Mortes...</i>

05:38.900 --> 05:42.500
Hochstadter's Treatise on Fractal Geometry
in 12-dimensional Space..."

05:44.200 --> 05:46.700
"Preoccupied" might not be
the word we're looking for.

05:46.700 --> 05:48.700
How fast can I get 'em?

05:48.700 --> 05:52.100
Half of these are antiquities
of the rarest order.

05:54.600 --> 05:57.900
If I exploit every connection
I've made over the last month...

05:57.900 --> 06:00.100
as the new head of Research
and Intelligence...

06:00.100 --> 06:02.100
20 minutes.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.300
Great. Let me know
when they're in.

06:04.300 --> 06:06.500
Under one condition.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.800
Dinner.

06:08.800 --> 06:13.300
- Oh, I, uh...
<i>- I mean you having one. A real one.</i>

06:13.300 --> 06:16.400
When's the last time you had
anything besides day-old takeout?

06:16.400 --> 06:18.600
Or had more than a nap
up in your lab?

06:18.600 --> 06:23.600
I'm okay, really.
Twenty minutes? Thanks.

06:23.600 --> 06:26.100
And don't worry.
I am totally, completely...

06:26.100 --> 06:28.700
- [Screams]
- Hey. Got a sec?

06:29.700 --> 06:32.300
[Clears Throat]
Um...

06:32.300 --> 06:36.100
I know how difficult it's been
going from a small detective agency...

06:36.100 --> 06:39.400
to running, uh,
Wolfram and Hart.

06:39.400 --> 06:44.800
- And-And we've all been adjusting, but...
- It's okay.

06:44.800 --> 06:48.000
Wes just gave me the talk.
And I'm going to have a good meal...

06:48.000 --> 06:51.400
and at least six hours of sleep,
so everybody can just stop worrying.

06:51.400 --> 06:54.600
I'm fine. Really.

06:54.600 --> 06:57.300
Good. That's...

06:57.300 --> 07:00.100
Actually, there's some
concern about how much...

07:00.100 --> 07:02.100
the Practical Science
Department's been spending.

07:03.300 --> 07:07.000
Oh. Um, yeah.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.700
I guess I may have gone over
my projections by a few...

07:09.700 --> 07:11.900
ยง800,000.

07:11.900 --> 07:14.200
That's how much you've
exceeded your quarterly budget.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.200
And the quarter
ain't over yet, sweetie.

07:17.200 --> 07:21.700
Look, l-I know it sounds like...
I mean, it is a lot of money...

07:21.700 --> 07:25.600
but l-I'm trying to do something
that's never been done before.

07:25.600 --> 07:29.500
So, yeah, attempting to
recorporealize Spike is going to cost...

07:29.500 --> 07:32.200
Whoa. Trying to do what?

07:32.200 --> 07:35.800
Make Spike corporeal again,
like you asked.

07:35.800 --> 07:41.400
Uh, no. What I asked for was for you to try to
find a way to get Spike <i>out</i> of Wolfram and Hart.

07:41.400 --> 07:45.200
Angel, we accepted the offer
to take over the L.A. Branch...

07:45.200 --> 07:48.900
of an evil, multidimensional law firm because
we thought we could make a difference.

07:48.900 --> 07:52.100
Use the resources of Wolfram and Hart
to do something decent.

07:52.100 --> 07:54.100
And how's that have
anything to do with Spike?

07:54.100 --> 07:58.700
He just saved the world. Vampire with
a soul fighting for the good of humanity.

07:58.700 --> 08:02.500
Ring anything?
He's just like you... a champion.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.900
God, I really hate that word.

08:04.900 --> 08:08.100
- Think of what an asset
he'd be fighting on our side.
<i>- Except he won't be.</i>

08:08.100 --> 08:11.400
I know Spike better than anyone,
and he only cares about himself.

08:11.400 --> 08:15.000
- And Buffy.
<i>- Well, this is getting interesting.</i>

08:15.000 --> 08:18.500
You're right.
He does care about Buffy.

08:18.500 --> 08:22.400
So where do you think he's going to run off to
as soon as his fresh new feet hit the ground?

08:22.400 --> 08:24.400
<i>Is that what this is about?</i>

08:24.400 --> 08:27.200
You're afraid he's gonna come back
and try to get with your ex again?

08:27.200 --> 08:31.800
<i>I just want you to be careful, Fred,</i>
<i>because I know how charming Spike can be.</i>

08:31.800 --> 08:33.900
He is quite the dish
with those eyes and...

08:33.900 --> 08:36.200
And hair and the cheeks and...

08:36.200 --> 08:38.100
What do you think I am, stupid?

08:38.100 --> 08:40.400
I know he's been playing me
with the looks and the smiles.

08:40.400 --> 08:43.000
I'm not some idiot schoolgirl
with a crush.

08:43.000 --> 08:45.500
Then what is it?

08:45.500 --> 08:50.000
It's about doing
what's right. Remember?

08:52.200 --> 08:54.600
Your department, your call.

08:55.800 --> 08:58.000
Just don't be disappointed
if it doesn't work.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.900
Some people can't be saved.

09:08.500 --> 09:11.400
Never a fetching mad scientist
about when you need one.

09:18.800 --> 09:22.400
<i>Whatever you're cobbling together, pet,</i>
<i>think you better hurry it along.</i>

09:22.400 --> 09:24.900
<i>[Buzzing]</i>

09:45.900 --> 09:48.600
Done chopping your feelers
off in the basement?

09:48.600 --> 09:51.700
Flown upstairs
for a few chuckles now?

09:57.100 --> 09:59.700
Right. Vampire ghost here, you sod.

09:59.700 --> 10:02.100
Bloody well invented
afraid of the dark.

10:16.800 --> 10:20.400
Bugger this. I'm not playing
follow-the-blinking-light for the rest of the...

10:22.400 --> 10:24.700
[Sighs]

10:29.000 --> 10:31.900
<i>[Sobbing]</i>

10:37.500 --> 10:40.500
All right. You lured me here
with the creep show.

10:40.500 --> 10:43.100
<i>- [Sobbing Continues]</i>
- Now what?

10:45.700 --> 10:47.900
Please.

10:47.900 --> 10:51.600
Hold me.
Hold me, please.

10:52.500 --> 10:55.600
It's coming.

11:08.900 --> 11:11.400
So, what's on the agenda?

11:11.400 --> 11:13.800
Rousting a nest of
venomous retirement plans?

11:13.800 --> 11:16.900
Shop's closed, Spike.
Come back and haunt me tomorrow.

11:16.900 --> 11:20.200
Yeah, it's too rarified up here
for my taste anyhows.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.500
Down with the dregs is
where I belong, isn't it?

11:23.500 --> 11:26.000
And yet he's still here.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.600
Just thought we could hang, is all.

11:29.600 --> 11:31.700
Couple of vampires
from the old days...

11:31.700 --> 11:35.700
doin' our hangy thing.

11:35.700 --> 11:38.200
<i>You're starting to feel it,</i>
<i>aren't you?</i>

11:38.200 --> 11:41.200
How close you are now.
To hell.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.200
What if I am?

11:45.200 --> 11:47.100
Not like it's such a big
bleeding deal, is it?

11:47.100 --> 11:49.000
If a ponce like you
could break out...

11:49.000 --> 11:53.000
I never escaped from hell. All I got was a short
reprieve. Not even sure how I managed that.

11:53.200 --> 11:56.700
Oh, put your martyr away,
Mahatma.

11:56.700 --> 12:00.000
Fred told me all about
your great, shining prophecy.

12:00.000 --> 12:04.300
Pile up all your good deeds and get the big
brass ring handed to you, like everything else.

12:04.300 --> 12:09.500
Except for one small catch.
The prophecy's a bunch of bull. They all are.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.700
<i>Nothing's written in stone</i>
<i>or fated to happen, Spike.</i>

12:11.700 --> 12:15.100
You save the world,
you end up running an evil law firm.

12:15.100 --> 12:17.900
Or playing Casper
with one foot in the fryer.

12:17.900 --> 12:20.600
Do you think any of it matters?

12:20.600 --> 12:22.700
The things we did...

12:22.700 --> 12:26.700
the lives we destroyed...
that's all that's ever gonna count.

12:26.900 --> 12:32.100
<i>So, yeah, surprise.</i>
<i>You're goin'to hell.</i>

12:32.100 --> 12:34.000
We both are.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.800
Then why even bother?

12:37.500 --> 12:40.800
Try to do the right thing,
make a difference.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.100
What else are we gonna do?

12:46.600 --> 12:50.400
So that's it then.
I really am going to burn.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.600
Welcome to the club.

12:55.500 --> 12:59.100
[Sighs]
Well, least I got company, eh?

12:59.100 --> 13:02.000
You and me, together again.

13:02.000 --> 13:05.200
Hope and Crosby.
Stills and Nash.

13:05.200 --> 13:08.200
- Chico and the Man.
- Yeah. Are we done?

13:08.200 --> 13:10.100
Never much for small talk,
were you?

13:10.100 --> 13:13.500
<i>Always too busy trying to perfect</i>
<i>that brooding block-of-wood mystique.</i>

13:13.500 --> 13:16.700
- God, I loved that.
- Not as much as I loved your nonstop yammering.

13:16.700 --> 13:20.500
The way you always had to be the big swingy,
swaggering around, barking orders.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.200
- Never listening.
- Always interrupting.

13:22.200 --> 13:25.800
And your hair. What color
do they call that? Radioactive?

13:25.800 --> 13:29.300
<i>Never much cared for you, Liam.</i>
<i>Even when we were evil.</i>

13:29.300 --> 13:31.500
- Cared for you less.
- Fine.

13:31.500 --> 13:33.100
Good.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.400
- There was one thing about you.
- Really?

13:42.400 --> 13:46.400
Yeah, I never told anybody about this,
but l-I liked your poems.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.900
You like Barry Manilow.

13:55.000 --> 13:58.100
- What is it?
- Don't you see it?

13:58.100 --> 14:00.800
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>See what?</i>

14:00.800 --> 14:03.100
Nothing.

14:03.100 --> 14:05.300
Too much talk
of fire and brimstone.

14:07.900 --> 14:09.600
What?

14:11.100 --> 14:13.800
- Right now?
- Yes. Right now, right here.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.100
Piss off! I'm trying to have
a conversation here.

14:16.100 --> 14:18.100
<i>- [Spike] Shut up.! I don't care...</i>
- Who's he talking to?

14:18.100 --> 14:20.100
- Ghosts.
- Where?

14:20.100 --> 14:22.900
<i>[Spike] Eve</i> ryw <i>here. The blighters</i>
<i>are coming out of the woodwork.</i>

14:22.900 --> 14:26.600
No, I am not talking to you.
Go away!

14:26.600 --> 14:28.500
We just checked with security.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.200
They do hourly sweeps with the mystics
to secure against spectral intrusion.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.900
- How many are we dealing with?
- Uh, none. Last sweep was 10 minutes ago.

14:33.900 --> 14:36.100
Spike's the only noncorporeal
in the building.

14:36.100 --> 14:38.700
<i>It's coming for you.</i>

14:38.700 --> 14:40.900
Check again.

14:40.900 --> 14:43.100
<i>Maybe we should</i>
<i>go back to the lab.</i>

14:43.100 --> 14:46.500
No. I'm telling you they are here. You have
to check again. Something's happened.

14:46.500 --> 14:49.400
It's here.

14:52.400 --> 14:57.000
Fred, please. You have to use that
perfect brain of yours and get me the hell...

14:58.100 --> 15:00.300
Spike?

15:00.300 --> 15:03.900
- Where'd he go?
- It's okay. He does this sometimes.

15:03.900 --> 15:07.500
- Does what?
- W-We should spread out, see if we can find him.

15:07.500 --> 15:11.300
- We just need to find him.
- Well, what are you goin' on about?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.099
Something's different this time.

Oh, that's not fair. I didn't even
have a soul when I did that.

<i>- [Wesley] The kind you don't recover from.</i>

<i>Know all your hiddens.</i>

31:17.600 --> 31:20.500
<i>Dirty red things you've done.</i>

31:20.500 --> 31:24.900
<i>Then fell in love,</i>
<i>won himself a soul.</i>

31:24.900 --> 31:28.800
<i>No more dirty things.</i>
<i>Thinks himself special.</i>

31:28.800 --> 31:32.600
- Thinks it matters.
<i>- [Hanging Man] Hell still waits.</i>

31:32.900 --> 31:36.400
<i>[Pavayne]</i>
<i>Knows he deserves it like all the others.</i>

31:36.400 --> 31:38.700
- You killed them.
<i>- No.</i>

31:38.700 --> 31:43.300
<i>Died themselves.</i>
<i>Here, in service of Wolfram and Hart.</i>

31:43.300 --> 31:48.400
<i>Little ants,</i>
<i>scurrying from the flames.</i>

31:48.400 --> 31:54.200
Their spirits hung on. Tried to keep from
tumbling into hell. Until you gave them a shove.

31:54.200 --> 31:56.800
<i>[Pavayne]</i>
<i>Burning now.</i>

31:56.800 --> 32:00.800
<i>Screaming forever,</i>
<i>like you'll scream.</i>

32:00.800 --> 32:04.400
If they're in hell, they can't
be here then, can they?

32:05.900 --> 32:09.200
<i>[Spike]Just more of your tricks.</i>
<i>They aren't real.</i>

32:09.200 --> 32:12.900
<i>- [Pavayne] Real enough.</i>
- [Yells]

32:12.900 --> 32:16.700
<i>Hell always hungers</i>
<i>for the wicked, boy.</i>

32:17.000 --> 32:18.900
<i>And it's feeding time.</i>

32:21.200 --> 32:24.600
- [Wesley] That's never good.
- What? Oh, no.

32:24.600 --> 32:27.900
L-I just ran out of white board.
I'm not crazy.

32:27.900 --> 32:30.200
- Again.
- Just scary smart.

32:30.200 --> 32:32.000
<i>You really think this'll bring Spike back?</i>

32:32.000 --> 32:34.100
Well, I had to extrapolate
a new variation...

32:34.100 --> 32:37.800
on interdimensional plasma dynamics
on the fly, but if the math holds...

32:37.800 --> 32:42.300
All right. First we'll try to get Spike back,
and then we'll deal with Pavayne.

32:42.300 --> 32:46.300
Wait. For this to work, it's gonna
require a massive surge of dark energy...

32:46.400 --> 32:48.600
- to catalyze the process.
- How massive?

32:48.600 --> 32:51.000
[Sighs]
The equivalent of nuclear evil.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.800
Where the hell are
we supposed to find that?

32:52.800 --> 32:56.300
Well, there is a legend...

32:56.300 --> 33:01.200
that tells of a volcano deep in
the forbidden jungles of South Africa.

33:01.200 --> 33:04.200
Or I might know a place
a little closer to home.

33:05.700 --> 33:07.700
The White Room?

33:07.700 --> 33:10.000
Why do you think they call it that?

33:10.000 --> 33:12.400
And how are we still in the building
when we're standing in a place...

33:12.400 --> 33:15.500
- that technically doesn't exist?
<i>- So this is your brainstorm?</i>

33:15.500 --> 33:18.500
You want to try and snip off a piece of the
conduit that connects Wolfram and Hart...

33:18.500 --> 33:21.100
<i>- to the other dimensions.</i>
- "Want" may be a hair strong.

33:21.100 --> 33:24.700
Last conduit took the form
of that creepy little girl.

33:24.700 --> 33:27.300
No telling what the new one's
decided to look like.

33:27.300 --> 33:30.700
- Actually, it's not that bad.
<i>- [Big Cat Roaring]</i>

33:30.700 --> 33:33.600
<i>- [Growling]</i>
- If you like cats.

33:33.600 --> 33:37.000
- Kind of a dog person.
<i>- [Roaring]</i>

33:37.000 --> 33:39.600
Lx-nay on the og-day.

33:39.600 --> 33:42.500
<i>Uh, look, we're-we're not here</i>
<i>to ruffle anything.</i>

33:42.500 --> 33:47.000
We're just wondering if maybe
we could borrow a couple of whiskers.

33:47.000 --> 33:49.600
<i>[Growling]</i>

33:49.600 --> 33:53.200
Whoa. Hey, easy.
It's me, Charles Gunn.

33:54.500 --> 33:57.300
You know I wouldn't be here
if the situation wasn't heavy.

33:57.300 --> 34:01.600
Just asking for a little help.
Me to you. Personal favor.

34:01.600 --> 34:04.300
- What do you say?
<i>- [Growling Softly]</i>

34:09.199 --> 34:12.400
Yeah.

34:12.400 --> 34:14.199
Who's a good kitty?

34:17.199 --> 34:20.000
<i>[Pavayne]</i>
<i>Disappointing.</i>

34:20.000 --> 34:23.800
<i>I expected more</i>
<i>from the soul of a vampire.</i>

34:26.199 --> 34:30.800
Too much conscience perhaps,
weighing it down.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.900
<i>[Clanging]</i>

34:32.900 --> 34:36.400
<i>[Pavayne]</i>
<i>Look. Hell knows you're ready.</i>

34:36.400 --> 34:39.600
<i>Plump and ripe.</i>

34:39.600 --> 34:42.699
Beginning to understand,
aren't you?

34:42.699 --> 34:45.900
<i>The soul that blesses you...</i>

34:48.400 --> 34:52.300
<i>damns you to suffer forever.</i>

34:55.400 --> 35:00.100
- [Gasps]
- You go now, William, so I can stay.

35:07.000 --> 35:11.900
Yes, squirm, boy.
It won't make a difference.

35:11.900 --> 35:13.900
Getting what you deserve.

35:13.900 --> 35:16.100
<i>[Spike Grunting]</i>

35:16.100 --> 35:19.200
You're right.
[Panting]

35:19.200 --> 35:21.300
I do deserve to go to hell.

35:24.600 --> 35:27.300
But not today.

35:27.300 --> 35:30.000
You dare!

35:31.400 --> 35:35.200
Quite a bit, mate.
Reality bends to desire.

35:35.200 --> 35:39.600
That was it, right? That's why I could
touch Fred. Write your name in the glass.

35:39.600 --> 35:42.200
All I had to do
was want it bad enough.

35:46.600 --> 35:50.000
And guess what I want to do now,
you prissy son of a bitch?

35:51.800 --> 35:54.300
Cute little racket you've
got carved out for yourself.

35:54.300 --> 35:56.800
<i>Prying off spirits</i>
<i>and sucking 'em down the chute.</i>

35:56.800 --> 36:00.100
<i>Kept your own toasties</i>
<i>out of the fire, didn't it? Till now.</i>

36:20.500 --> 36:23.100
Not so much fun
when we hit back, is it?

36:25.800 --> 36:27.500
It's starting to be.

36:29.000 --> 36:33.500
Make sure it's calibrated
to minus.058.

36:33.500 --> 36:36.800
- Did you get it?
- Make it count. Told me we ain't gettin' any more.

36:36.800 --> 36:38.800
<i>It talks?</i>
<i>I didn't hear it talk.</i>

36:38.800 --> 36:41.800
- Maybe you weren't listening right.
- I think we're almost ready.

36:41.800 --> 36:43.900
- So how do we let Spike know?
- Won't have to.

36:43.900 --> 36:46.700
<i>This baby puts out enough juice</i>
<i>to light up Ghost City.</i>

36:46.700 --> 36:50.700
Anything remotely spectral around here's
about to get the tinglies.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.800
[Grunts]

36:57.100 --> 36:59.700
[Exhales]
Learned a few of my tricks.

36:59.700 --> 37:01.900
Means nothing, does it?

37:05.900 --> 37:09.900
I've cheated hell
for hundreds of years.

37:10.100 --> 37:13.900
Fed it other dirty little souls.

37:14.200 --> 37:18.200
Left me alone.
Let me get stronger.

37:18.200 --> 37:22.000
<i>Now, in this realm...</i>

37:22.300 --> 37:24.300
I am God.

37:24.300 --> 37:27.100
And you?

37:27.100 --> 37:30.200
Wood for the fire.

37:37.500 --> 37:41.500
This won't do.
This won't do at all.

37:41.500 --> 37:43.500
- [Beeping]
- [Fred] He's here!

37:43.500 --> 37:46.100
Spike, step
into the circle! Hurry!

37:46.100 --> 37:48.600
We've only got one chance
of making you corporeal again...

37:52.500 --> 37:54.700
Why ever would
I want to do that?

37:54.700 --> 37:56.800
- Fred!
<i>- Pavayne. He's killing her.</i>

38:03.400 --> 38:05.000
Decisions.

38:05.000 --> 38:09.500
The girl... [Chuckles]
Or the flesh.

38:09.500 --> 38:11.400
There's no time for both.

38:13.800 --> 38:17.800
<i>There's hope for you yet, boy.</i>

38:18.000 --> 38:20.000
Not really.

38:29.200 --> 38:32.100
No! Defilers!

38:32.100 --> 38:35.000
I'll cut you into nothing!

38:35.000 --> 38:36.800
<i>I'll feast on your brains.!</i>

38:36.800 --> 38:41.800
I'll swim in lakes
of your own blood!

38:41.800 --> 38:43.600
<i>[Angel]</i>
<i>You'll shut the hell up.</i>

38:43.600 --> 38:46.300
Don't kill him. If he becomes
a spirit again, we'll never stop him.

38:46.300 --> 38:49.600
Fine. No killing.
Just a whole lot of bruising.

38:56.400 --> 38:58.400
Sure you're all right?

38:58.400 --> 39:02.400
Yeah. It's just... you know.

39:05.200 --> 39:08.200
Why don't you take a break?
We'll finish up.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.500
Thanks.

39:31.700 --> 39:33.800
Don't suppose you built a spare.

39:35.900 --> 39:41.000
<i>Most of the pieces I used on this one</i>
<i>were practically nonexistent to start with.</i>

39:42.700 --> 39:46.500
Even if I could replace them,
the chances of finding another power source...

39:50.000 --> 39:52.900
I'm sorry.

39:52.900 --> 39:56.900
Don't be, luv.
Made my choice.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.000
Wouldn't change it for the world.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.100
There are other things we could try.
They're a little riskier, but...

40:03.100 --> 40:07.700
No. I'm not going to
end up like Pavayne.

40:07.700 --> 40:11.300
Cheating hell any way he could,
no matter who it hurt.

40:12.400 --> 40:14.700
Just proves what
I've been telling everybody.

40:14.700 --> 40:17.600
That I'm a handsome devil
who brightens the place up?

40:21.400 --> 40:23.300
That you're worth saving.

40:29.000 --> 40:30.900
Don't have it so bad really.

40:30.900 --> 40:33.300
Plenty of room.
Good company.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
<i>Even picked up a few new tricks.</i>

40:47.000 --> 40:51.400
I guess there's worse things
than being a ghost.

40:55.600 --> 40:59.400
- You sure it'll hold him?
- Permanent storage.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.500
If there's anything
Wolfram and Hart excels at...

41:01.500 --> 41:04.600
it's keeping their
unmentionables unmentioned.

41:06.000 --> 41:10.000
Congratulations.
You get to live forever.

41:10.100 --> 41:12.500
Unable to move, to touch...

41:12.500 --> 41:15.000
<i>or to feel.</i>

41:15.000 --> 41:18.200
<i>Or to affect anything</i>
<i>in the world around you.</i>

41:18.200 --> 41:21.800
But don't worry.
I had them give you a window.

41:24.700 --> 41:27.700
- [Clang]
<i>- [Lock Locking]</i>

41:27.700 --> 41:31.500
Welcome to hell.
