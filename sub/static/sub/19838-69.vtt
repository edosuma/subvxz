00:01.740 --> 00:04.550
<b>Hello? Pitou-sama?</b>

00:05.350 --> 00:07.440
<b>This is Komugi.</b>

00:07.440 --> 00:11.970
<b>I'm fine, so don't worry.</b>

00:14.790 --> 00:15.810
<b>Got it...</b>

00:20.170 --> 00:23.790
<b><i>Now, Pitou is also under my spell...</i></b>

00:24.500 --> 00:28.550
<b><i>The spell of the lie that will 
free Pitou from that curse.</i></b>

00:31.520 --> 00:32.290
<b>Gon...</b>

00:32.600 --> 00:35.340
<b>You listened to my request.</b>

00:37.460 --> 00:41.850
<b>So I will be honest with you.</b>

00:46.200 --> 00:47.440
<b>He is</b>

00:49.000 --> 00:50.020
<b>already</b>

00:51.160 --> 00:52.690
<b>dead.</b>

01:14.680 --> 01:18.310
<b>His soul is no longer here.</b>

01:19.290 --> 01:22.340
<b>There is no way to heal him.</b>

01:30.740 --> 01:31.780
<b>I am sorry.</b>

01:39.490 --> 01:40.380
<b><i>Huh?</i></b>

01:41.330 --> 01:44.450
<b><i>Why is it healing Pitou's arm?</i></b>

01:45.560 --> 01:47.820
<b><i>Turn Kite back to normal.</i></b>

01:52.410 --> 01:54.010
<b><i>Please...</i></b>

01:55.120 --> 01:58.110
<b><i>After you finish what you're doing...</i></b>

03:19.970 --> 03:24.970
<b>Anger x And x Light</b>

03:31.200 --> 03:33.480
<b>The tables have been turned.</b>

03:35.830 --> 03:40.740
<b>Pitou believes we have recovered Komugi.</b>

03:41.690 --> 03:45.740
<b>The way things are looking, 
that Gon boy will be killed.</b>

03:47.020 --> 03:50.990
<b>I am the only one who can stop Pitou.</b>

03:52.330 --> 03:56.250
<b>If you hand the woman over 
to me, I will stop Pitou...</b>

04:04.490 --> 04:07.100
<b>Get lost, scumbag!</b>

04:10.010 --> 04:11.770
<b>Leave her to me.</b>

04:12.860 --> 04:17.280
<b>I swear upon these eyes that 
I will not let them have her.</b>

04:18.520 --> 04:20.530
<b>Yeah, I'm counting on you.</b>

04:21.360 --> 04:22.530
<b><i>Speed of Lightning!</i></b>

04:25.480 --> 04:26.280
<b><i>Gon...</i></b>

04:26.970 --> 04:29.340
<b><i>Wait for me to get there!</i></b>

05:41.780 --> 05:42.860
<b>Gon...</b>

05:44.530 --> 05:47.350
<b>I'm sorry to say this,</b>

05:49.620 --> 05:51.360
<b>but I must kill you.</b>

05:54.000 --> 05:55.360
<b>For the King.</b>

06:08.020 --> 06:09.140
<b><i>You must</i></b>

06:09.890 --> 06:11.180
<b><i>kill me?</i></b>

06:12.320 --> 06:14.200
<b><i>You aren't going to heal him?</i></b>

06:18.110 --> 06:21.210
<b><i>Then you really aren't</i></b>

06:23.040 --> 06:25.000
<b><i>going to heal Kite...</i></b>

06:39.140 --> 06:40.580
<b>Liar.</b>

07:48.670 --> 07:49.650
<b><i>What?</i></b>

07:52.300 --> 07:54.660
<b><i>What is this?</i></b>

08:04.950 --> 08:06.830
<b><i>I don't care</i></b>

08:11.290 --> 08:12.970
<b><i>if this is the end...</i></b>

08:48.870 --> 08:49.860
<b><i>So...</i></b>

08:51.960 --> 08:53.440
<b><i>I'll use everything.</i></b>

09:00.150 --> 09:03.290
<b><i>I was right.</i></b>

09:04.990 --> 09:07.970
<b><i>His power is now equal</i></b>

09:08.950 --> 09:10.740
<b><i>to that of the King!</i></b>

09:14.410 --> 09:18.090
<b>I'll kill you,</b>

09:21.520 --> 09:23.460
<b>Pitou!</b>

09:35.940 --> 09:37.510
<b><i>Terpsichora!</i></b>

09:41.050 --> 09:43.000
<b><i>Exceed your limits,</i></b>

09:43.000 --> 09:44.270
<b><i>and dance!</i></b>

09:52.010 --> 09:54.540
<b><i>I must stop him here!</i></b>

10:14.490 --> 10:15.800
<b><i>It can't be!</i></b>

10:17.970 --> 10:19.550
<b><i>Is he heading for the King?</i></b>

10:47.190 --> 10:48.210
<b>Come.</b>

10:50.290 --> 10:53.570
<b>I don't want to destroy this place.</b>

11:05.170 --> 11:06.320
<b>This way.</b>

11:10.020 --> 11:11.280
<b>Follow me.</b>

12:06.410 --> 12:08.570
<b><i>I don't know how he did it,</i></b>

12:09.120 --> 12:11.520
<b><i>but he's forced his body to mature to a point</i></b>

12:14.170 --> 12:16.350
<b><i>at which he's able to defeat me.</i></b>

13:19.870 --> 13:22.260
<b><i>First comes</i></b>

13:27.830 --> 13:29.280
<b><i>rock...</i></b>

13:59.750 --> 14:00.560
<b><i>Rock.</i></b>

14:01.990 --> 14:02.820
<b><i>Paper.</i></b>

14:05.810 --> 14:06.820
<b><i>Rock.</i></b>

14:24.370 --> 14:26.950
<b>Sinking deeply into unconsciousness,</b>

14:26.950 --> 14:29.260
<b>Pitou felt a sense of relief.</b>

14:30.630 --> 14:32.400
<b><i>Thank goodness...</i></b>

14:37.820 --> 14:43.290
<b><i>This power could only be achieved through 
the sacrifice of his own life energy.</i></b>

14:45.550 --> 14:48.800
<b><i>He's prepared to never use</i> Nen <i>again.</i></b>

14:49.880 --> 14:54.620
<b><i>That was the resolve required 
to perform this feat.</i></b>

15:02.340 --> 15:04.830
<b><i>An enemy blessed with immense talent</i></b>

15:05.340 --> 15:11.550
<b><i>has been forced to exchange all 
of that talent for this power.</i></b>

15:21.450 --> 15:23.080
<b><i>I'm so glad</i></b>

15:24.160 --> 15:25.400
<b><i>I am the one</i></b>

15:26.950 --> 15:28.540
<b><i>that he will kill...</i></b>

15:40.620 --> 15:46.640
<b>Having used Speed of Lightning to race 
to Gon, Killua arrived to hear...</b>

16:00.580 --> 16:02.940
<b><i>Which one of them is doing that?</i></b>

16:08.280 --> 16:09.190
<b><i>Gon!</i></b>

16:11.380 --> 16:13.790
<b>And what he found was...</b>

16:22.000 --> 16:25.840
<b>A silhouette that looked nothing 
like the person he'd known,</b>

16:25.840 --> 16:29.960
<b>swinging a fist, bloodied from countless punches,</b>

16:30.840 --> 16:35.780
<b>downward toward the skull 
of an already-broken Pitou...</b>

16:35.780 --> 16:36.790
<b><i>Rock.</i></b>

16:37.700 --> 16:38.720
<b><i>Paper.</i></b>

16:44.770 --> 16:48.020
<b>...for the final, shattering blow.</b>

17:01.680 --> 17:02.980
<b>Kite...</b>

17:05.100 --> 17:09.360
<b>I finished the job, the way you taught me to.</b>

17:12.910 --> 17:14.030
<b>So...</b>

17:22.180 --> 17:23.270
<b>Gon,</b>

17:24.400 --> 17:25.390
<b>is that you?</b>

17:31.870 --> 17:33.030
<b>Killua...</b>

17:36.000 --> 17:40.780
<b>Having seen Gon's appearance, 
Killua immediately thought of Bisky.</b>

17:41.440 --> 17:45.040
<b>But he realized the difference at once.</b>

17:46.350 --> 17:49.310
<b><i>Bisky's appearance changed,</i></b>

17:49.310 --> 17:52.850
<b><i>but there wasn't a massive increase 
in the aura contained within her.</i></b>

17:53.580 --> 17:55.050
<b><i>And in Bisky's case,</i></b>

17:55.050 --> 17:57.430
<b><i>she was merely reverting to her original form.</i></b>

17:57.830 --> 18:00.180
<b><i>But Gon's done the opposite!</i></b>

18:02.550 --> 18:03.570
<b><i>How many years?</i></b>

18:04.270 --> 18:05.400
<b><i>More than ten?</i></b>

18:05.850 --> 18:07.270
<b><i>Decades?</i></b>

18:07.740 --> 18:11.860
<b><i>This would have been the result 
of years of endless training.</i></b>

18:15.250 --> 18:19.450
<b><i>What price did he have to pay 
to obtain so much aura?</i></b>

19:34.610 --> 19:37.050
<b>Pitou's devotion to the King was so great</b>

19:37.050 --> 19:41.280
<b>that even after death, Terpsichora clad 
itself in even more powerful <i>Nen</i>,</b>

19:41.280 --> 19:47.460
<b>transforming Pitou into a corpse puppet 
ready to leap forward in pursuit of its prey,</b>

19:47.460 --> 19:49.550
<b>its sole purpose to kill Gon.</b>

19:52.840 --> 19:57.560
<b>In that fraction of a second, 
shorter than the blink of an eye,</b>

19:58.180 --> 20:00.920
<b>Killua heard Gon speak.</b>

20:01.880 --> 20:03.060
<b>It's okay.</b>

20:06.790 --> 20:08.230
<b>It doesn't hurt.</b>

20:09.450 --> 20:11.020
<b>I'm not trying to be tough.</b>

20:12.960 --> 20:16.290
<b>I'm kind of happy...</b>

20:18.710 --> 20:20.320
<b>I finally</b>

20:21.360 --> 20:23.630
<b>get to be the same</b>

20:25.150 --> 20:26.350
<b>as Kite was then.</b>

20:28.100 --> 20:29.040
<b>Gon...</b>

20:33.270 --> 20:34.660
<b>I feel like</b>

20:35.620 --> 20:36.940
<b>I've been redeemed some.</b>

20:52.850 --> 20:54.680
<b><i>You can have my right arm.</i></b>

20:56.450 --> 20:59.610
<b><i>First comes rock...</i></b>

21:05.680 --> 21:06.370
<b>Gon!</b>

21:07.420 --> 21:08.600
<b><i>It's time for you</i></b>

21:09.320 --> 21:10.870
<b><i>to sleep, too.</i></b>

21:14.570 --> 21:15.740
<b><i>Stop...</i></b>

21:15.740 --> 21:16.940
<b><i>You can't!</i></b>

21:17.260 --> 21:19.380
<b><i>If you keep using this power,</i></b>

21:20.210 --> 21:23.380
<b><i>what will happen to you?</i></b>

21:24.200 --> 21:24.880
<b><i>Rock.</i></b>

21:27.610 --> 21:28.580
<b><i>Paper.</i></b>

21:33.540 --> 21:35.590
<b>Gon!</b>

23:25.200 --> 23:27.550
<b>Next time: Flash x And x Start.</b>

23:28.300 --> 23:31.430
<b>I never got a chance to say this, but thank you...</b>

23:32.540 --> 23:33.600
<b>For everything.</b>
