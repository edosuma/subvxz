02:32.000 --> 02:34.082
Dead means they're broken?

02:35.333 --> 02:39.040
Well, their bodies
are broken, yes.

02:39.166 --> 02:43.707
- And they're under the ground?
- Their bodies are, yes.

02:43.833 --> 02:46.832
Tell me what dead is.

02:46.958 --> 02:50.207
When you...

02:50.333 --> 02:53.999
When you look at the photographs
of Thomas and Timothy,

02:54.125 --> 02:56.207
do you remember the stories
of what they're doing?

02:56.333 --> 02:59.832
- Yes.
- Well,

02:59.958 --> 03:04.707
Tom and Timmy are alive
in your imagination.

03:04.833 --> 03:07.165
It makes me sad
to think about them.

03:07.291 --> 03:10.374
Makes me sad too, Ruthie.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.457
But Mommy's sadder.

03:14.250 --> 03:16.540
Well, yes.

03:52.583 --> 03:55.790
Does your son have a driver's license?

03:55.916 --> 03:57.790
Jesus.

03:57.916 --> 04:00.749
You don't have to yell, Minty.

04:00.875 --> 04:04.249
Yeah?
Well, let me consider it, will ya?

04:05.666 --> 04:07.707
Yeah.

04:07.833 --> 04:10.540
All right.
I'll call you back. Bye.

04:24.125 --> 04:27.290
It still gets cold
in the evening?

04:27.416 --> 04:30.207
Thanks.

04:30.333 --> 04:33.832
Jesus. Look at this yard.

04:36.333 --> 04:39.665
We should clear out some of these
straggly looking flower beds.

04:43.208 --> 04:45.249
I want to put in a swimming pool.

04:45.375 --> 04:47.874
Why?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.790
Oh, for Ruth when she gets older.

04:51.916 --> 04:55.624
Something like the one we had
in Providence. They loved it.

04:55.750 --> 05:00.124
And the lawn... It ought to be
more like an athletic field.

05:02.125 --> 05:04.290
No.

05:04.416 --> 05:08.957
- Look at this picture.
- Who is he?

05:09.083 --> 05:14.040
That's Minty O'Hare's son...
the boys' English teacher from Exeter.

05:14.166 --> 05:16.082
He wants a summer job.

05:16.208 --> 05:18.749
He wants to be a writer.

05:18.875 --> 05:20.832
What would he do for you?

05:20.958 --> 05:23.499
It's mainly for the experience,
I suppose.

05:23.625 --> 05:28.457
I mean, if he's thinking about
becoming a writer, he should see

05:30.166 --> 05:33.540
What would he actually do for you?

05:33.666 --> 05:35.624
Well...

05:42.166 --> 05:44.124
I've been thinking.

05:46.166 --> 05:50.040
I want to try separating...
for the summer.

05:54.208 --> 05:56.374
Just temporarily.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.540
So you began your career writing novels?

06:30.666 --> 06:36.499
Yes, but they were terrible novels.
Unfortunately I had to write

06:36.625 --> 06:39.957
before I realized
I am not a writer of adult fiction.

06:40.083 --> 06:44.040
I am simply an entertainer of children,
and I like to draw.

06:44.208 --> 06:47.665
Edward, don't be nervous
because he's famous.

06:47.791 --> 06:50.082
He's an Exonion.

06:50.208 --> 06:52.707
His sons were charming boys...

06:52.833 --> 06:55.957
but... mediocre students.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.832
Why do cautionary tales for children
come so naturally to you?

06:58.958 --> 07:02.207
Well, I think I can imagine
their fears and express them.

07:02.333 --> 07:05.290
- In my stories,
- Anyway,

07:05.416 --> 07:09.207
you can see what's coming, but you
don't see everything that's coming.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.874
Note his work habits.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.290
See if there's a method
to his madness.

07:14.416 --> 07:17.707
And... above all...

07:17.833 --> 07:21.915
throw yourself in headlong
and just do whatever it is

07:22.041 --> 07:25.040
In my opinion, there is no better opening
to any story than the opening of

07:25.166 --> 07:29.082
- I mean, the first lines...
- "Tom woke up, but Tim did not."

07:30.208 --> 07:32.874
Daddy, I had a dream.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.082
I heard a sound.

07:36.333 --> 07:38.582
What sort of sound, Ruth?

07:38.708 --> 07:42.415
It's in the house,
but it's trying to be quiet.

07:51.416 --> 07:54.165
Well, let's go look for it, then.

07:54.291 --> 07:58.624
It's a sound that's trying to be quiet?
What did it sound like?

07:58.750 --> 08:03.832
It was a sound like someone
trying not to make a sound.

08:15.791 --> 08:17.832
Your penis looks funny.

08:19.750 --> 08:22.457
My penis is funny.

08:22.625 --> 08:26.040
- Come out, sound.
- Come out, sound.

08:27.625 --> 08:31.249
I'll tell you a story
about a different sound.

08:31.375 --> 08:34.539
One night when Thomas
was just your age,

08:34.666 --> 08:37.374
and Timothy was still in diapers,

08:37.500 --> 08:41.789
- Tommy heard a sound.
- Did they both wake up?

08:41.916 --> 08:44.164
Oh, Tom woke up,

08:44.291 --> 08:46.749
but Tim did not.

08:47.833 --> 08:51.332
And Tom woke up his father...

08:51.458 --> 08:53.999
and asked him,
"Did you hear that sound?"

08:56.666 --> 09:00.165
"There's the sound again,"
Tom whispered to his Father.

09:00.291 --> 09:03.374
"It's a monster!" he cried.

09:03.500 --> 09:06.082
"It's just a mouse...

09:06.208 --> 09:08.707
crawling between the walls,"

09:08.833 --> 09:10.749
his father said,

09:10.875 --> 09:14.374
and thumped the wall hard
with his hand.

09:14.500 --> 09:16.790
And the mouse...

09:16.916 --> 09:18.874
scurried away.

09:20.666 --> 09:23.207
"It's just a mouse,

09:23.333 --> 09:25.374
"that's all," Tom said.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.207
And he quickly fell asleep.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.957
But Tim,

09:31.083 --> 09:34.165
he stayed awake all night long.

09:34.291 --> 09:39.124
And every time that thing
crawling between the walls

09:39.250 --> 09:41.207
he'd hit the wall,

09:41.333 --> 09:44.415
and he'd listen to the monster...

09:44.541 --> 09:46.499
scurry away,

09:46.625 --> 09:49.374
dragging his thick, wet fur,

09:49.500 --> 09:52.832
and no arms and no legs with it.

09:55.083 --> 09:58.624
- And that...
- Is the end of the story.

10:01.208 --> 10:03.165
Where's Mommy?

10:04.875 --> 10:07.374
Mommy... It's her turn
at the other house, remember?

10:07.500 --> 10:11.499
It's my turn tomorrow night.
But she'll be here in the morning, okay?

10:11.625 --> 10:15.915
- Okay.
- Are there any mice in this house?

10:17.041 --> 10:21.165
Everyone has mice.

10:21.291 --> 10:23.249
Mice are everywhere.

10:25.291 --> 10:27.374
See you in the morning, Ruthie.

11:36.375 --> 11:39.624
Eddie? Eddie?

11:42.625 --> 11:44.999
- Mrs. Cole?
- Marion.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.249
Come.

11:52.375 --> 11:55.707
- You can drive, can't you?
- Oh, yeah. Yes I can.

11:55.833 --> 12:00.207
I know boys your age.
They love to drive

12:00.333 --> 12:04.207
Yes, ma'am. But I don't know

12:04.333 --> 12:07.207
- It's an automatic.
- Okay.

12:07.333 --> 12:09.999
Yes, ma'am.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.415
Sorry about before. I was...

12:12.541 --> 12:14.749
I was expecting Mr. Cole.

12:14.875 --> 12:18.374
Ted lost his license
three months ago.

12:18.500 --> 12:21.624
You're not at Exeter anymore.
You can call us by our first names.

12:22.916 --> 12:25.749
Okay.

13:08.875 --> 13:11.040
Aren't you coming in?

13:11.166 --> 13:13.124
Not tonight.

13:30.833 --> 13:33.540
Did it hurt?

13:33.666 --> 13:36.665
No, I'm all right. I'm all right.
Don't worry about me.

13:36.791 --> 13:39.082
It is an honor to meet you, sir.

13:39.208 --> 13:43.540
I want to thank you in advance
for this experience.

13:43.666 --> 13:46.707
Ed, this is Doctor Loomis.
Eddie's my new assistant.

13:46.833 --> 13:49.582
- Hi.
- Yeah. Exeter, '05.

13:49.708 --> 13:51.957
I was class of '61. Good stuff.

13:52.083 --> 13:54.540
- So, Tuesday, yeah? See you then.
- Right.

13:54.666 --> 13:57.374
Nice to meet you, Eddie. Ciao.

13:57.500 --> 14:00.082
I've read all your novels
and all your children's books...

14:00.208 --> 14:03.665
- Yeah, 3:30.
- Got it.

14:03.791 --> 14:06.540
I've... I read all your novels
and all your children's books,

14:06.666 --> 14:09.207
and my favorite is
The Door in the Floor.

14:09.333 --> 14:13.332
Well, you're probably
one of the few people on earth

14:14.458 --> 14:18.082
So what makes you think
you want to be a writer, Eddie?

14:18.208 --> 14:20.624
Oh, I wrote something,
and I brought it with me.

14:20.750 --> 14:24.374
I'd be extremely honored
if you might read it,

14:24.500 --> 14:28.957
Well, writing is rigorous work.
I keep myself incredibly busy.

14:30.000 --> 14:34.415
- Yeah.
- Many of my books contain

14:34.541 --> 14:38.874
every word must be examined
and re-examined thoroughly.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.832
You're going to be spending the whole
summer looking for le mot juste,

14:42.958 --> 14:45.040
- The right word. The true word.
- Okay. Well,

14:45.166 --> 14:48.165
I'm prepared to throw myself in headlong
and do whatever you need me to do.

14:48.291 --> 14:51.957
Yeah, because I'm sure there'll be
many different tasks that will come up.

14:52.083 --> 14:54.957
- Oh, all right.
- For example, I need squid.

14:55.083 --> 14:58.874
I'm using squid ink for my new book,

14:59.000 --> 15:01.665
and for all my drawings now.

15:01.791 --> 15:03.665
There's a...

15:03.833 --> 15:06.874
a woman in Montauk,
she's a fishmonger.

15:07.000 --> 15:10.040
- She collects the squid ink for me.
- Should I go today?

15:10.166 --> 15:14.665
You can go tomorrow.
You see her husband over there,

15:14.791 --> 15:19.707
Also, I have to tell you...
because it's a little complicated...

15:19.833 --> 15:24.665
you've arrived here during
what is a sad time in a long,

15:24.791 --> 15:28.999
Marion and I, we're separating...

15:29.125 --> 15:31.874
temporarily, on a trial basis.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.624
And I've...
I've rented a small apartment in town,

15:34.750 --> 15:37.915
and every other night one of us
will be spending the night there.

15:38.041 --> 15:42.290
During the day, you'll work there
at the apartment while I'm working here,

15:42.416 --> 15:44.999
but you'll sleep here.

15:46.458 --> 15:49.874
I know it seems
unnecessarily complicated, but...

15:50.000 --> 15:53.457
it's hard to know what's...
what's best for my daughter.

15:53.583 --> 15:58.290
Anyway, your bedroom
is in the main house, upstairs,

15:59.416 --> 16:03.165
You want to take
your stuff up there, relax?

16:03.291 --> 16:05.207
Unpack.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.290
Okay, well,

16:07.416 --> 16:10.415
make yourself comfortable, Eddie.

16:10.541 --> 16:12.832
Thank you, sir.

16:12.958 --> 16:15.915
And... I'm sorry about your marriage.

16:16.041 --> 16:18.249
Me too, Eddie.

16:18.375 --> 16:20.332
Anyway,

16:22.041 --> 16:24.915
I'm sure you're gonna do great here.

16:25.041 --> 16:28.874
It's gonna be a good summer for ya.
I'm glad to have ya.

17:19.583 --> 17:21.874
Did you see the shrine?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.790
It's kinda creepy?

17:24.915 --> 17:27.290
It's sad.

17:27.415 --> 17:30.082
- You go to Exeter, right?
- Yeah, I'm an upper.

17:30.208 --> 17:33.290
- An “upper”?
- Yeah, like, an upperclassman...

17:33.416 --> 17:36.290
- like, kind of like a junior.
- Your father's a teacher there, right?

17:36.416 --> 17:39.624
- So you get to go for free?
- Yeah.

17:39.750 --> 17:42.082
He was their teacher, right?
So that's why you're here?

17:42.208 --> 17:44.165
I guess.

17:46.416 --> 17:50.082
- Did you know them before they died?
- No, but I heard a lot about them.

17:50.208 --> 17:53.540
When I was in eighth grade
I used to date a senior from Exeter.

17:54.583 --> 17:58.665
- Really?
- Yeah. He was older than you,

17:58.791 --> 18:03.415
His name was, like,
Chickie or Chuckie or something.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.665
It was probably a nickname.

18:11.750 --> 18:15.457
You know, it... it's quite common
to have a nickname there.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.790
It is.

18:42.208 --> 18:44.582
Oh, great, you got it.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.749
- Just in time.
- Yes, sir.

18:46.875 --> 18:49.957
Here, wait. Just a second.

18:52.166 --> 18:55.249
Here. I want you to...

18:55.375 --> 18:58.832
put it in here
and then freeze it.

18:58.958 --> 19:00.874
What should I do next?

19:01.000 --> 19:04.915
I'm sketching a model. Why don't you
go to the beach, take a swim?

19:05.041 --> 19:07.790
I... I could straighten up
the workroom or something else.

19:07.916 --> 19:09.957
No, no. Go ahead.

19:10.083 --> 19:13.624
Anything really.
I just want to help.

19:13.750 --> 19:15.665
Contemplating the waves...

19:15.791 --> 19:21.457
will be a hell of a lot more useful
to you as a young writer

19:21.583 --> 19:24.374
- Okay.
- There'll be...

19:24.500 --> 19:28.040
plenty more rigorous work to do...

19:28.166 --> 19:30.790
at some point in the near future.

19:32.791 --> 19:34.749
Don't spill that stuff.

19:50.583 --> 19:52.707
Take your dress off, please.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.749
And your bra.

21:03.625 --> 21:05.499
Morning, Eddie.

21:05.625 --> 21:07.624
Morning, ma'am.

22:39.000 --> 22:43.165
Bright, yeah! Colors!

23:36.000 --> 23:37.874
- Hi.
- Hi.

23:38.000 --> 23:40.540
- Did you just see that movie?
- Yes.

23:40.666 --> 23:42.624
Me too.

23:44.250 --> 23:46.624
- Is that your dinner?
- Sort of, yeah.

23:46.750 --> 23:51.457
I... got kind of tired of burgers.
I've had one every night since I got here.

23:51.583 --> 23:54.624
- Ted doesn't get you anything?
- Not really.

23:54.750 --> 23:58.499
I mean, he would. It's just,
I don't think Ruth likes to eat with me.

23:58.625 --> 24:02.582
I don't think your parents
would like it if they thought

24:02.708 --> 24:05.207
They wouldn't mind,
really, I don't think.

24:09.625 --> 24:12.207
Eddie, would you like
to go to dinner one night?

24:12.333 --> 24:16.207
I'll make sure you get
something... decent.

24:16.333 --> 24:18.457
- Okay.
- Okay?

24:18.583 --> 24:20.790
- Yeah.
- Good.

24:20.916 --> 24:23.082
Thanks. Good night.

24:23.208 --> 24:25.165
- See you.
- Bye.

25:07.458 --> 25:09.499
Eddie?

25:09.625 --> 25:11.665
Just one second!

25:11.791 --> 25:14.957
Ruth wanted to be sure that one
of the photographs was still here.

25:15.083 --> 25:19.624
She gets anxious if she can't see them
or if they get moved.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.790
- Which one was it, sweetie?
- There it is.

25:25.041 --> 25:28.749
He's just a little broken,
but he won't die, right?

25:28.875 --> 25:31.582
- Not yet.
- No. Ruthie had a dream.

25:31.708 --> 25:35.415
- Where's feet?
- What are you talking about?

25:35.541 --> 25:37.957
Where are the feet?

25:38.083 --> 25:39.707
Sorry, Eddie.

25:39.833 --> 25:44.290
We've gotten in the habit
of showing Ruth these pictures,

25:44.416 --> 25:46.415
That's okay.
You can see them anytime.

25:46.541 --> 25:49.040
See?
See you in the morning, Eddie.

25:49.166 --> 25:51.665
What did he do?

26:47.791 --> 26:50.207
That's Mrs. Vaughn.

26:50.333 --> 26:53.874
Came over to discuss some sketches.
Had some questions about them.

26:54.000 --> 26:58.665
Guess she's an early riser.

26:58.791 --> 27:01.040
Do you want me
to drive you home now, or...

27:01.166 --> 27:04.040
I'm gonna... I'm gonna walk.
I left the revisions on my desk.

27:04.166 --> 27:07.457
After I finish,
what should I do next?

28:31.333 --> 28:33.457
Eddie, I should have knocked.

28:37.958 --> 28:42.374
It's my fault.
I-I'm not angry. I...

28:42.500 --> 28:45.540
I'm just... I'm just embarrassed.

28:48.833 --> 28:50.790
Eddie?

29:01.125 --> 29:04.332
Come here, please.

29:11.583 --> 29:16.582
It's funny. Let's just call it funny
and leave it at that.

29:17.750 --> 29:19.790
Eddie?

29:19.916 --> 29:22.290
Look at me.

29:23.791 --> 29:25.749
Sit.

29:37.750 --> 29:40.332
I know boys your age.

29:40.458 --> 29:44.207
I know it's what boys your age do,
isn't it?

29:44.333 --> 29:47.874
Look, Eddie, I am flattered.

29:48.000 --> 29:53.249
It felt good to know that someone
was at least thinking about me.

29:53.375 --> 29:57.499
Oh, not to assume that you
were thinking about me...

29:57.625 --> 30:01.624
Maybe about my clothes.
And I know you probably have

30:01.750 --> 30:05.790
- I didn't...
- I think about what you were wearing

30:07.125 --> 30:10.499
It was a pink sweater,
buttons up the front.

30:10.625 --> 30:12.582
Oh!

30:13.666 --> 30:16.290
That sweater, it's so old.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.874
Because of how it must feel
against your skin.

30:24.125 --> 30:26.707
Oh.

30:31.166 --> 30:33.290
Would you do me a favor?

30:36.125 --> 30:38.957
Take this down with you.

30:39.083 --> 30:41.207
- Please?
- All right.

30:43.125 --> 30:45.082
Thank you.

31:02.666 --> 31:05.957
I'll probably be about an hour.
Here. Why don't you go over the revisions?

31:13.166 --> 31:16.999
- Hey, do you want your supplies?
- Oh, yeah.

31:56.916 --> 31:58.874
Hi.

31:59.000 --> 32:01.332
You look nice.

32:01.458 --> 32:05.332
The tie or the jacket.
You really don't need both.

32:05.458 --> 32:07.415
Okay.

32:11.375 --> 32:13.957
How's the work going for you?

32:14.083 --> 32:17.499
I just retype A Sound Like Someone
Trying Not to Make a Sound

32:17.625 --> 32:20.832
Sometimes he changes
a comma from a semicolon,

32:20.958 --> 32:23.957
and then the next morning
he changes it back.

32:26.708 --> 32:30.915
- He needs a computer.
- Ted needs a driver.

32:31.041 --> 32:35.124
That's why he hired you,
because he needs a driver.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.707
I don't get to drive
much at home, so...

32:47.166 --> 32:49.374
Eddie, you're so serious.

32:49.500 --> 32:53.499
Boys your age
shouldn't be so serious.

32:53.625 --> 32:57.374
I know a joke,

32:57.500 --> 32:59.832
Tell me.

32:59.958 --> 33:04.040
There's this battleship out in the ocean,
and the captain of it, Captain Stern,

33:04.166 --> 33:08.915
this captain learns that the mother
of one of his sailors just died.

33:09.041 --> 33:11.624
And the sailor's name
is Midshipman Abernathy.

33:11.750 --> 33:17.165
So the captain thinks and thinks,
and he tries to come up with the best way

33:17.291 --> 33:22.999
And finally after staying up all night,
he comes up with a nice way

33:23.125 --> 33:27.415
So the next morning he calls
the crew up on deck and says,

33:27.541 --> 33:32.165
"Gentlemen, all of you whose mothers
are still living, step forward.

33:32.291 --> 33:35.874
Not so fast, Abernathy."

33:39.125 --> 33:41.999
- I-I like that joke, Eddie. I...
- No, it's a... it's a dumb joke.

33:42.125 --> 33:44.582
I do. I do.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.832
Why don't you ask Alice
out on a date?

33:57.500 --> 33:59.374
She's not my type.

34:00.500 --> 34:02.707
Well, she's a good nanny anyway.

34:16.416 --> 34:19.665
I think it was wrong of us
to have had Ruth.

34:22.250 --> 34:25.206
When we first moved here,
the idea was,

34:25.333 --> 34:27.373
a new place,

34:28.833 --> 34:30.748
a new child,

34:30.875 --> 34:33.206
a new life, I suppose.

34:36.000 --> 34:37.956
Ted's a good father.

34:39.708 --> 34:44.206
But he doesn't really know how
to do all the stuff you have to do.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.290
And I can't.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.540
I can't with her.

34:59.708 --> 35:03.457
I picked that one
because they're in silhouette,

35:03.583 --> 35:06.665
and you can almost imagine
what they would look like now.

35:10.708 --> 35:12.790
Timothy looks guilty.

35:13.916 --> 35:16.415
Thomas looks like a wild animal.

35:24.583 --> 35:27.207
This one's funny.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.290
Tommy looks so...

35:31.750 --> 35:33.707
scared.

36:19.791 --> 36:23.749
- I hope I'm not disturbing you.
- Oh, no. No, not at all.

36:25.291 --> 36:27.415
You can tell in this picture...

36:29.166 --> 36:31.624
Timothy is more introspective,

36:31.750 --> 36:33.707
like you.

36:41.291 --> 36:44.040
And you know where this is?

36:44.166 --> 36:46.749
What does it say?

36:48.666 --> 36:51.665
"Come hither, boys, and become men."

36:55.708 --> 36:59.207
Not pink with lilac.

36:59.333 --> 37:01.874
Oh.

37:02.000 --> 37:04.707
I wasn't thinking about the colors.

37:06.500 --> 37:08.957
I don't know if they had sex.

37:09.083 --> 37:12.624
Thomas, maybe. He was so popular.

37:12.750 --> 37:16.790
But, Timothy, he was so shy.

37:19.541 --> 37:21.999
That's all boys want, isn't it?

37:22.125 --> 37:24.082
Yes.

37:25.416 --> 37:27.374
Before I die.

37:37.333 --> 37:39.457
Have you had sex, Eddie?

37:46.500 --> 37:48.457
No.

37:53.833 --> 37:56.082
Well, it's too hot in here,

37:57.291 --> 38:00.665
so I hope you'll forgive me
if I don't wear the sweater.

38:53.583 --> 38:57.415
You still really haven't had sex,
have you, Eddie?

38:57.541 --> 38:59.457
Not really.

39:01.333 --> 39:03.290
No, not really.

39:07.458 --> 39:09.415
But I feel...

39:10.625 --> 39:12.957
I feel complete.

39:19.166 --> 39:21.124
Come here.

39:48.666 --> 39:53.165
"There was a little boy"

39:53.291 --> 39:56.540
"His mommy didn't know if
she wanted him to be born either."

39:56.666 --> 40:01.665
"They lived in a cabin in the woods
on an island in a lake,"

40:01.791 --> 40:04.415
“and there was no one else around.

40:04.541 --> 40:08.915
"And in the cabin
there was a door in the floor."

40:10.166 --> 40:14.415
"The little boy was afraid of what
was under the door in the floor,"

40:14.541 --> 40:17.665
“and the mommy was afraid too.

40:17.791 --> 40:22.915
"Once, long ago, other children had come
to visit the cabin for Christmas,"

40:23.041 --> 40:26.290
"but the children had opened
the door in the floor..."

40:26.416 --> 40:28.790
“and had disappeared down the hole.

40:29.833 --> 40:33.582
"The mommy had tried
to look for the children,"

40:33.708 --> 40:37.832
"but when she opened
the door in the floor she heard"

40:37.958 --> 40:41.124
"that her hair turned
completely white..."

40:41.250 --> 40:43.374
"like the hair of a ghost."

40:44.750 --> 40:49.374
"And the mommy had
also seen some things,"

40:49.500 --> 40:53.457
"things so horrible
you can't imagine them."

40:54.666 --> 40:57.665
"And so the mommy wondered..."

40:57.791 --> 40:59.874
"if she wanted to have a little boy,"

41:00.000 --> 41:04.540
“especially because of everything
that might be under the door in the floor.

41:04.666 --> 41:08.707
"And then she thought, 'Why not?"

41:08.833 --> 41:12.582
"I'll just tell him not to open
the door in the floor.'"

41:14.375 --> 41:16.332
"Yet the little boy..."

41:16.458 --> 41:18.874
“still didn't know
if he wanted to be born...

41:19.000 --> 41:22.207
"into a world where there was
a door in the floor."

41:23.291 --> 41:27.249
"But there were some beautiful things
in the woods,"

41:27.375 --> 41:30.374
“on the island and in the lake.

41:30.500 --> 41:33.124
"'Why not take a chance?' he thought."

41:34.458 --> 41:39.374
"And so the little boy was born
and he was happy,"

41:40.500 --> 41:43.957
“and his mommy was happy again too.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.999
"Although she told the boy..."

41:47.125 --> 41:50.332
“at least once every day,

41:50.458 --> 41:53.749
“'Don't ever, not ever,

41:53.875 --> 41:56.332
“'never, never, never...

41:56.458 --> 41:59.082
“open the door in the floor.'

42:02.833 --> 42:07.040
"But, of course, he was only a little boy.

42:07.166 --> 42:09.832
"If you were that little boy,

42:09.958 --> 42:13.207
wouldn't you want to open
that door in the floor?"

42:22.833 --> 42:26.874
The publisher thinks
the drawings are too rudimentary

42:27.000 --> 42:30.457
But, I'm just
an entertainer of children,

42:30.583 --> 42:32.707
and I like to draw.

42:36.666 --> 42:40.540
Nudes...
Nudes are a requisite fundamental exercise

42:40.666 --> 42:43.207
- like... like landscapes.
- So you do landscapes too?

42:43.333 --> 42:46.249
No. Long Island's too flat.

42:46.375 --> 42:49.665
You don't prefer to use
professional models?

42:49.791 --> 42:53.665
If nakedness...
I mean, the feeling of nakedness...

42:53.791 --> 42:59.249
well, there's no nakedness that compares
to what it feels like to be naked

42:59.375 --> 43:02.332
Right, Eddie?

43:02.458 --> 43:04.957
Yes. Yeah. No.

43:06.000 --> 43:08.290
Woman Singing, Indistinct)

43:11.916 --> 43:16.499
- I'm grateful to you, Eddie.
- My pleasure. It was very interesting.

43:16.625 --> 43:18.749
No, I mean...

43:18.875 --> 43:21.957
I'm grateful to you for being
such a good friend to Marion.

43:24.750 --> 43:26.707
She's been so unhappy.

43:28.333 --> 43:30.957
It's good to see her smiling again.

44:44.333 --> 44:46.457
Hello, Cole residence.

44:48.916 --> 44:52.457
No, he's not here yet.
Should I go look for him?

44:55.541 --> 44:57.499
Unsteady?

45:11.416 --> 45:13.374
Excuse me, Mr. Cole.

45:14.416 --> 45:19.040
Patrick called
from Bobby Van's restaurant.

45:20.083 --> 45:23.457
- He said you might want a ride home.
- I have a ride.

45:27.541 --> 45:29.499
Go on home, Eddie.

45:30.541 --> 45:34.457
Sorry, Mr. Cole. Good night.

46:42.666 --> 46:45.124
- Ready, Eddie?
- Yup.

46:48.666 --> 46:53.624
I converted this barn
into a squash court

46:53.750 --> 46:56.415
Not quite regulation
in its dimensions.

46:56.541 --> 47:01.124
Plus there's a dead spot
in the floor by the back walls.

47:01.250 --> 47:05.040
So, basically, I'm considered
even by the best players on the island...

47:05.166 --> 47:07.707
to be unbeatable on my own court.

47:07.833 --> 47:11.665
- You play much?
- This is my third time.

47:11.791 --> 47:15.540
Well, don't expect
mercy from me.

47:15.666 --> 47:18.249
I'm gonna grind you
into a fine powder.

47:33.666 --> 47:37.040
Where those red lines intersect,
that's called the "T."

47:37.166 --> 47:40.749
Whoever controls the "T"
controls the game.

47:40.875 --> 47:43.957
You need to win control of the "T"
if you hope to win the game.

47:45.791 --> 47:47.749
7-love.

48:01.416 --> 48:03.915
- Jesus!
- You all right?

48:04.041 --> 48:06.582
Yeah, I'm fine.

48:06.708 --> 48:09.957
Yeah, it was a good shot though.
Still made it to the wall.

48:10.083 --> 48:12.999
Isn't that a let?
Aren't you supposed to just

48:13.125 --> 48:15.457
Well, technically you're right,
but I'll take the point.

48:15.583 --> 48:18.499
Can't just take the "T."
You gotta earn it.

48:25.666 --> 48:30.040
90, 9-1, 9-0.

48:32.250 --> 48:35.290
You look like a boy
who'll sleep well tonight.

48:35.416 --> 48:39.374
Maybe you need to catch up
on your sleep anyway, hmm?

49:09.291 --> 49:13.374
Stop screaming, honey.
It's okay. It's just Eddie and me.

49:13.500 --> 49:15.665
G-Go back to bed, okay?

49:17.166 --> 49:20.874
- Okay?
- Okay.

49:24.833 --> 49:28.415
- Did you get the stamps?
- Two rolls.

49:31.625 --> 49:35.249
They still have the ones
with the nocturnal animals?

49:38.041 --> 49:41.415
Anyway, I...

49:41.541 --> 49:44.040
I presume it was Marion's mistake,

49:44.166 --> 49:48.624
but surely it was a mistake
for the two of you

49:52.291 --> 49:55.582
I'm not threatening you,
Eddie, but I must tell you...

49:55.708 --> 50:00.124
that you may be
called upon to testify.

50:00.250 --> 50:05.540
In the event of a custody dispute,
regarding which one of us

50:08.833 --> 50:12.790
I would never have let a child
see me with another woman,

50:12.916 --> 50:16.082
has really made no effort
whatsoever to protect Ruth...

50:16.208 --> 50:19.040
from seeing what she saw.

50:19.166 --> 50:23.707
And if you are asked to testify
to what happened,

50:23.833 --> 50:27.540
I trust that you won't lie...
not in a court of law.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.707
From the sound of it,
it was a rear-entry position...

50:37.833 --> 50:42.040
not that I have a personal problem
with that or any other position.

50:42.166 --> 50:44.165
But for a child,

50:45.625 --> 50:48.040
I imagine doing it doggishly...

50:48.166 --> 50:51.290
must seem especially animalistic.

51:07.666 --> 51:10.665
I'll only be about 25 minutes today.

51:12.500 --> 51:14.457
Just a quick sketch.

51:22.166 --> 51:25.207
I've never been unfaithful to Ted.

51:32.750 --> 51:34.874
Why didn't you leave him?

51:36.833 --> 51:38.832
Ted understands me.

51:42.166 --> 51:45.290
Ted's the only one that really
knows what happened to me.

51:51.833 --> 51:53.957
You don't need some time?

52:00.541 --> 52:03.332
What are you doing?

52:04.375 --> 52:06.624
Okay. Ready?

52:08.416 --> 52:11.499
He starts with conventional portraits...

52:11.625 --> 52:14.540
a mother, a child.

52:14.666 --> 52:17.957
Then the mother,
then the mother nude.

52:19.000 --> 52:22.040
Then the nudes go through phases,

52:22.166 --> 52:25.540
like innocence, modesty,

52:25.666 --> 52:27.624
degradation...

52:28.666 --> 52:30.540
and shame.

52:30.666 --> 52:33.249
Mrs. Vaughn?

52:33.375 --> 52:36.874
Mrs. Vaughn is experiencing the...

52:37.000 --> 52:39.290
degrading phase right now.

52:41.916 --> 52:45.707
Move your head to the light.

52:48.916 --> 52:51.457
To the...
Evelyn, more to the light.

52:53.791 --> 52:55.749
Evelyn.

53:51.500 --> 53:53.790
I want to know more about you.

53:55.000 --> 53:57.374
You know too much already.

54:06.500 --> 54:08.624
Tell me about the accident.

54:10.166 --> 54:13.290
I mean, do you know
how it happened, or...

54:14.333 --> 54:16.540
or was it anybody's fault?

54:26.041 --> 54:28.124
Marion?

54:39.000 --> 54:42.290
- M-Marion?
- Mommy.

54:48.291 --> 54:50.249
Mommy.

55:33.708 --> 55:38.040
It was early in the morning,

55:38.166 --> 55:43.249
Thomas and Timothy crawled
under the covers. And Daddy

55:43.375 --> 55:46.415
But what did you did
to the feet?

55:47.916 --> 55:50.290
Well, maybe it never happened.

55:50.416 --> 55:53.957
- You know, maybe it was just a dream.
- No.

55:54.083 --> 55:59.540
- I guess it's just a mystery.
- No, it was paper.

55:59.666 --> 56:02.124
- Don't you want to go back to bed?
- Yes.

56:02.250 --> 56:06.374
Bring the picture.
It's my picture. It's not yours.

56:06.500 --> 56:08.457
That's true.

56:27.875 --> 56:32.290
Mommy! Mommy!

56:42.250 --> 56:46.374
She cut her finger, badly.

56:49.750 --> 56:53.707
- It's okay.
- Am I going to die?

56:53.833 --> 56:57.124
No. You're not going to die.

56:57.250 --> 56:59.457
You're not going to die.

57:02.208 --> 57:06.165
You don't understand. I put the picture
in her room. It's my fault.

57:06.291 --> 57:10.832
That's not the point. The point is,
you shouldn't have gone into her room

57:10.958 --> 57:14.332
- That's her mother's job.
- I told you, Marion was asleep.

57:14.458 --> 57:18.124
"I doubt it. I doubt “asleep" would
accurately describe Marion's condition.

57:18.250 --> 57:21.874
I did it to her. I asked her
about the accident.

57:22.000 --> 57:24.374
It doesn't matter.

57:24.500 --> 57:28.124
She was a great mother to the boys,
but she's for shits now.

57:28.250 --> 57:32.124
- It's my fault.
- No. It's Marion's fault.

57:33.666 --> 57:36.207
- Ruthie, please.
- Mommy!

57:36.333 --> 57:38.874
- Come on now. Go to sleep now. Please.
- Mommy!

57:39.000 --> 57:41.207
- I'm here, sweetie. Come on.
- Mommy!

57:41.333 --> 57:43.540
- Mommy!
- Come on. Now, please, Ruth.

57:43.666 --> 57:45.624
- Mommy!
- Come on now, honey.

57:45.750 --> 57:50.290
- Mommy! Mommy!
- Come on.

57:56.000 --> 58:01.499
She had a bad dream.
She heard bangs. Heard a banging noise.

58:01.625 --> 58:05.540
- What kind of banging noise?
- I... I don't know.

58:05.666 --> 58:07.624
What difference does it make?

58:12.083 --> 58:14.415
Come on, honey.

58:14.541 --> 58:17.582
It's okay.

58:17.708 --> 58:22.415
It's okay.

58:22.541 --> 58:24.499
It's okay.

58:26.333 --> 58:29.249
It's okay. It's okay.

58:52.833 --> 58:56.082
It's okay. It's okay. Come on.

59:23.791 --> 59:26.249
Take me back.

59:31.041 --> 59:34.332
Like you should Right now, lick it good

59:34.416 --> 59:36.374
Lick this just like you should

59:36.500 --> 59:41.040
My neck, my back
Lick my pussy and my crack

59:41.166 --> 59:45.957
My neck, my back
Lick my pussy and my crack

59:46.083 --> 59:48.707
Leave it! Goddamn it.

59:48.833 --> 59:53.332
That nigga, get on your knees
A bitch like me moans and screams

59:53.458 --> 59:57.540
Thug misses know what I mean
At the club, so fresh, so clean

59:57.666 --> 01:00:00.624
Hos hatin' niggas watchin' me

01:01:27.833 --> 01:01:30.040
Why now?

01:01:32.083 --> 01:01:34.790
I've stayed too long already.

01:02:20.333 --> 01:02:22.207
You want me to do what?

01:02:22.333 --> 01:02:28.082
I want you to give her these,
but not the portfolio.

01:02:28.208 --> 01:02:30.874
Just the drawings...
I want the portfolio back.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.124
Isn't she expecting you?

01:02:33.250 --> 01:02:35.915
Tell her I'm not coming,

01:02:36.041 --> 01:02:39.082
but I wanted her to have the drawings.

01:02:41.666 --> 01:02:45.832
It... It might be, awkward...

01:02:45.958 --> 01:02:47.874
to ask for the portfolio back.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.624
It won't be a problem.

01:02:56.458 --> 01:03:01.082
I-I don't really understand.
He... He wants to give them to me.

01:03:01.208 --> 01:03:03.457
He said he wanted you
to have them.

01:03:06.333 --> 01:03:09.707
But when is he coming?
He's coming Friday, isn't he?

01:03:09.833 --> 01:03:13.749
I have the whole day for him on Friday.
He knows I have the day.

01:03:13.875 --> 01:03:16.915
Will you stop?
Is he coming on Friday?

01:03:17.041 --> 01:03:19.374
- I-I don't know.
- Yes, you do know.

01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.832
Did you look at those drawings?

01:03:27.125 --> 01:03:29.207
My God, I'm locked out.

01:03:29.333 --> 01:03:32.957
- You're gonna have to break in.
- Me?

01:03:38.041 --> 01:03:42.207
You're gonna have to carry me
over the glass. I have bare feet.

01:03:42.333 --> 01:03:46.624
How dare you? How dare you detest me?

01:03:46.750 --> 01:03:50.874
"- You're not exactly living
an “un-sordid" life yourself, are you?

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.957
Oh, go!

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:59.374
Why did she think you looked
at the drawings? Did you?

01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:04.707
- Oh, Christ. Of course you did.
- No. I didn't.

01:04:04.833 --> 01:04:09.582
- Jesus. She did what?
- She didn't mean to, but she exposed...

01:04:09.708 --> 01:04:13.624
- Jesus Christ!
- She locked herself out because of you.

01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:17.374
She said you liked all the doors
to be locked, and you didn't like

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:19.665
- She told you that?
- Yes.

01:04:19.791 --> 01:04:23.249
She said she had the whole day
for you Friday.

01:04:23.375 --> 01:04:25.915
I can't spend the whole day
with her Friday.

01:04:26.041 --> 01:04:31.415
You're gonna have to come
and pick me up in 45 minutes.

01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.540
On Friday morning,

01:04:35.666 --> 01:04:38.790
I know... for half an hour.

01:04:38.916 --> 01:04:42.749
No. You're never going back,

01:04:42.875 --> 01:04:47.707
and it'll take him all day
to make his way back home by himself.

01:04:47.833 --> 01:04:51.290
Mrs. Vaughn won't offer him a ride.

01:04:51.416 --> 01:04:53.957
I don't expect him back before dark.

01:04:54.083 --> 01:04:56.790
Ted's gonna be really pissed off.

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:03.540
I read your... your story.

01:05:03.666 --> 01:05:09.540
- Oh. I thought you forgot.
- No. I just didn't have a chance

01:05:09.666 --> 01:05:13.582
- It's not very good, is it?
- Oh, it's... it's very heartfelt,

01:05:13.708 --> 01:05:16.040
very... very personal.

01:05:16.166 --> 01:05:18.874
It's...

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.707
Well, it's just a collection
of personal anecdotes

01:05:23.833 --> 01:05:26.999
- It's...
- I was just tryin' to see if I could

01:05:27.125 --> 01:05:31.124
Oh, it seems true. It
just isn't very interesting.

01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:35.332
Sort of a...
an emotional outburst, but...

01:05:35.458 --> 01:05:38.499
it isn't really a story.

01:05:38.625 --> 01:05:44.040
And that... the guy, Hank...
you know, the one who dies at the end?

01:05:44.166 --> 01:05:48.207
You need to prepare a reader
for something like that.

01:05:48.333 --> 01:05:53.040
It just... It didn't seem like
the way things happened.

01:05:53.166 --> 01:05:57.415
You need to let your audience
guess what's gonna happen...

01:05:57.541 --> 01:06:01.374
you know, anticipate
what's gonna happen...

01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:05.040
But, you have to guide them through it.
You know what I mean?

01:06:05.166 --> 01:06:09.124
There's a part of writing that...

01:06:09.250 --> 01:06:12.374
involves a certain manipulation.

01:06:12.500 --> 01:06:17.874
That may seem cold to you,
but it is, you know, sort of cold.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:23.332
Everything in fiction is a tool:
Pain, betrayal,

01:06:24.458 --> 01:06:26.332
even death.

01:06:26.458 --> 01:06:29.540
These are, you know...

01:06:29.666 --> 01:06:35.582
These are like different colors
on a painter's palette.

01:06:41.291 --> 01:06:45.707
Also, the details...
they could be more specific, you know?

01:06:45.833 --> 01:06:51.790
Specific details... they create
whole scenes in a reader's mind.

01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:57.290
Not being specific, that's just sloppy.
It's sloppy thinking.

01:06:57.416 --> 01:07:00.915
- S-Specific details?
- Yeah...

01:07:01.041 --> 01:07:04.415
smells, taste... details.

01:07:06.458 --> 01:07:09.999
But I'll tell ya, for a...

01:07:10.125 --> 01:07:12.332
for a first effort, it's not that bad.

01:07:12.458 --> 01:07:14.499
- You know, the...
- Thanks.

01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:19.249
The prose is a little purple,
a little pretentious.

01:07:19.375 --> 01:07:22.582
You're welcome.

01:07:25.791 --> 01:07:29.999
You ever think about
getting a computer?

01:07:30.125 --> 01:07:35.374
Be easier to do
your own revisions that way,

01:07:41.875 --> 01:07:44.624
- Maybe the next book.
- Yeah.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:59.582
Oh, boy.

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:02.374
I'm not gonna last
a half hour with this woman.

01:08:02.500 --> 01:08:05.915
Twenty minutes tops, maybe 10.

01:08:19.666 --> 01:08:21.624
Five.

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:41.749
If he hits you, hit him back.
He won't make a fist.

01:08:41.875 --> 01:08:44.207
At worst, he'll slap you.

01:08:44.332 --> 01:08:47.915
You should make a fist,
and punch him in the nose.

01:08:48.041 --> 01:08:50.582
If you punch him in the nose,
he'll stop.

01:08:53.207 --> 01:08:56.624
You can call Alice
to help you with Ruth.

01:08:56.750 --> 01:08:59.207
You better start to like her a little.

01:08:59.332 --> 01:09:04.749
When Ted kicks you out,
you're going to need a ride

01:09:04.875 --> 01:09:07.457
And who's gonna
explain this to Ruth?

01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:13.540
I won't be a bad mother to her.

01:09:13.666 --> 01:09:16.832
I'd rather be no mother
than to be a bad mother to her.

01:09:16.957 --> 01:09:19.499
That doesn't make any sense.

01:09:23.957 --> 01:09:26.707
I don't want her to be like me.

01:09:26.832 --> 01:09:30.790
Remember, honey, don't cry
when the doctor takes the stitches out.

01:09:30.916 --> 01:09:33.874
I promise you, it won't hurt.

01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:38.207
Can I keep the stitches
to show you?

01:09:45.832 --> 01:09:51.707
You can take her anywhere for lunch.
All she ever eats is grilled cheese

01:09:51.832 --> 01:09:55.374
- And ketchup.
- And ketchup.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.457
I have money.

01:10:09.625 --> 01:10:11.832
I love you.

01:10:11.958 --> 01:10:13.915
So long, Eddie.

01:10:30.708 --> 01:10:32.999
- Evelyn. Evelyn, wait! Wait now!
- Come here, you son of a bitch!

01:10:33.125 --> 01:10:35.707
Come here, goddamn it!
I'll kill you, you fucking fraud!

01:10:35.833 --> 01:10:37.707
Evelyn, Evelyn, Evelyn.

01:10:37.833 --> 01:10:40.415
Evelyn!

01:11:00.833 --> 01:11:04.457
Why the hell did he...

01:11:21.333 --> 01:11:24.290
Run!

01:12:28.833 --> 01:12:32.290
All right. And one more.

01:12:33.375 --> 01:12:36.207
- Did we get the picture?
- What picture?

01:12:36.333 --> 01:12:40.082
- Feet.
- Oh, the photograph.

01:12:40.208 --> 01:12:45.374
That's not very nice.
My stitches are ready.

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:50.207
Yeah. You know what? You're right.
Let's go to the frame shop and tell 'em

01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:00.082
Ted Cole?

01:13:00.208 --> 01:13:02.707
Yes. It is. It is Ted Cole.
Good morning, Mendelssohn.

01:13:02.833 --> 01:13:06.457
- It is Ted Cole. It is.
- Forgive me for bleeding.

01:13:06.583 --> 01:13:09.040
Don't be silly. It's nothing
you need be forgiven for.

01:13:09.166 --> 01:13:11.457
- Could you...
- Get Mr. Cole a chair.

01:13:11.583 --> 01:13:13.457
Can't you see he's bleeding?

01:13:13.583 --> 01:13:16.374
- Look, I...
- You look. If there's no manager here,

01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:21.124
There must be someone else here besides
you, and I'm not leaving without that

01:13:22.166 --> 01:13:26.290
- Did you get mad at her?
- Yes, I did.

01:13:27.333 --> 01:13:31.457
To put it simply,
I need a ride home.

01:13:31.583 --> 01:13:34.040
I'll take you myself.

01:13:34.166 --> 01:13:37.207
Of course, I'm going to have

01:13:37.333 --> 01:13:40.707
She's probably out shopping,
but not for too long.

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:45.707
You see, my car,
it's in the shop.

01:13:45.833 --> 01:13:48.624
I use a bicycle,
else I'd take you home.

01:13:49.708 --> 01:13:51.957
Mm. Too bad.

01:13:53.916 --> 01:13:56.540
You warned him, you disgusting cretin.

01:13:56.666 --> 01:14:00.749
If you have killed him, Mrs. Vaughn,
you would have gone to jail.

01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:05.582
You want this?
It's your last pay check. You're fired.

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:09.207
I understand that you're angry.
I'm very sorry about that.

01:14:09.333 --> 01:14:14.540
When my customers are angry,
I ask them to voice their complaints

01:14:14.666 --> 01:14:19.790
I work for Ted Cole.
I'm a writer's assistant.

01:14:33.250 --> 01:14:36.249
"60 times." Really?

01:14:36.375 --> 01:14:39.124
Yes.

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:49.790
The Vaughns of Gin Lane?

01:14:49.916 --> 01:14:55.457
We framed a painting
by Sibley for them called

01:14:56.583 --> 01:14:58.457
Please go on.

01:14:59.583 --> 01:15:03.540
Your signature is very, very beautiful.

01:15:03.666 --> 01:15:07.832
I need a pen with a broader nib.
Also, some red ink, hmm?

01:15:07.958 --> 01:15:10.165
Red like blood,
not like a fire engine.

01:15:10.291 --> 01:15:12.249
Yes. Of course.

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:48.124
This is Ruth. She's four.

01:15:52.125 --> 01:15:54.915
- What do you want from me?
- Just the photograph.

01:15:55.041 --> 01:15:58.207
It's of Ruth's mother.
She's in a bed in a hotel room in Paris.

01:15:58.333 --> 01:16:00.374
It's not a good picture of the boys.
It's only their feet.

01:16:00.500 --> 01:16:03.707
- Yes, I know. Ruth likes the feet.
- Are the feet ready?

01:16:03.833 --> 01:16:06.457
Yes, dear.

01:16:06.583 --> 01:16:09.874
I'll go check.
Should be almost ready.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:12.374
Can I have my writing back, please?

01:16:12.500 --> 01:16:17.832
It's really not out of my way.
I'd be honored to take you. Really.

01:16:17.958 --> 01:16:21.082
No. That's all right.
Someone else will come along soon.

01:16:21.208 --> 01:16:24.040
It's no trouble.
Really, I don't mind.

01:16:24.166 --> 01:16:28.582
- No. Really. There you are.
- If you need a few minutes,

01:16:28.708 --> 01:16:31.540
- I-I'd be thrilled to take you. Really.
- No.

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:39.790
- There's no charge for the photograph.
- Thank you.

01:16:45.750 --> 01:16:48.915
Yes. I'm sorry.

01:16:49.041 --> 01:16:52.374
- Is the blood all gone?
- Yes, dear. See?

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:54.707
As good as new.

01:16:54.833 --> 01:16:59.040
- Okay. Thanks.
- Young man,

01:16:59.166 --> 01:17:01.040
perhaps next summer.

01:17:01.166 --> 01:17:06.040
I can always use an extra hand
in the summer.

01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:09.915
She wrote her freshman English
term paper on you.

01:17:10.041 --> 01:17:13.957
What was the title of your term paper?

01:17:15.666 --> 01:17:21.457
"An Analysis of
the Atavistic Symbols of Fear"

01:17:22.541 --> 01:17:26.040
As you know, myths
and fairy tales of tribal peoples

01:17:26.166 --> 01:17:29.207
like magic doors
and children disappearing...

01:17:29.333 --> 01:17:32.957
and people being so frightened
their hair turns white overnight.

01:17:34.333 --> 01:17:39.790
And the vagina?
When the little boy's in the womb,

01:17:39.916 --> 01:17:43.207
- How long was this paper?
- Twenty-eight pages...

01:17:43.333 --> 01:17:46.582
not counting the footnotes
and bibliography.

01:17:47.666 --> 01:17:49.624
But...

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:53.707
I don't suppose you girls have a car?
Believe it or not, I need a ride.

01:18:18.708 --> 01:18:22.957
- Oh. Is this sandwich for me?
- Yes.

01:18:23.083 --> 01:18:26.582
These slippers are just wonderful.

01:18:26.708 --> 01:18:29.832
They were a Christmas gift
from me to my late husband.

01:18:29.958 --> 01:18:31.915
- May I?
- Please.

01:18:36.041 --> 01:18:41.415
- I'll get the clothes right back to you.
- I was just gonna give them

01:18:41.541 --> 01:18:43.457
Look at that.

01:18:43.583 --> 01:18:46.915
Phil was almost exactly your size.

01:18:48.750 --> 01:18:50.707
Oh.

01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.790
You know,
this is rather serendipitous.

01:18:56.916 --> 01:19:01.040
I've been looking
for two suitable subjects

01:19:01.166 --> 01:19:04.415
Something I'm thinking about for my book.

01:19:04.541 --> 01:19:08.040
At first I would want to draw
you and your daughter together.

01:19:08.166 --> 01:19:10.624
That way, when I draw
each one of you separately,

01:19:10.750 --> 01:19:15.082
the presence of the other one is...
is somehow there.

01:19:15.208 --> 01:19:17.082
How long would it take, and...

01:19:17.208 --> 01:19:20.915
which one of us would you

01:19:21.041 --> 01:19:24.457
I should do Glorie first.

01:19:24.583 --> 01:19:29.040
First...
Well, first, the two of you together,

01:19:29.166 --> 01:19:34.499
then Glorie alone,
and then when Glorie's

01:19:34.625 --> 01:19:37.874
Mr. Cole,
you really are an enigma.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.790
So which are you,
and artist or a writer?

01:19:41.916 --> 01:19:44.415
Oh, Glorie, I'm...

01:19:44.541 --> 01:19:48.332
I'm neither, really. I'm...
I'm just an entertainer of children,

01:19:48.458 --> 01:19:50.874
and I like to draw.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:53.082
What sort of drawings
did you have in mind?

01:19:53.250 --> 01:19:55.707
Don't... No, no, no! Don't stop.

01:19:55.833 --> 01:19:58.957
- My goodness.
- Wiper! Wiper.

01:20:12.166 --> 01:20:17.374
Yeah. Why don't you
just come in and wait on the porch.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.457
I'll be right there.

01:21:37.875 --> 01:21:42.374
Would you like
some refreshments,

01:21:42.500 --> 01:21:47.707
For the whole rest of your life,
whenever you need to feel brave,

01:21:47.833 --> 01:21:53.207
Your hand will grow bigger,
and your finger will grow bigger,

01:21:53.333 --> 01:21:57.707
And it will always show up
in your fingerprint.

01:21:57.833 --> 01:21:59.790
I'll show you.

01:22:23.083 --> 01:22:27.124
- Those are my fingerprints.
- That's really neat, Ruthie.

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:30.249
So you were at the doctor's office
getting the stitches taken out?

01:22:30.375 --> 01:22:33.290
And we went to the beach.
And we had lunch.

01:22:33.416 --> 01:22:36.582
And Eddie showed me
my fingerprint.

01:22:36.708 --> 01:22:40.207
- I see the photograph was ready finally.
- We got the feet back!

01:22:40.333 --> 01:22:43.874
Look at all this sand in your hair, Ruth.
You're gonna need a bath.

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:49.957
Well, I was waiting quite a while
for you this morning. Where were ya?

01:22:51.041 --> 01:22:53.624
- Where's Marion going?
- I'll give her the bath.

01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:56.165
- Answer me.
- Read that first.

01:22:56.291 --> 01:22:59.790
- What's this?
- It's the only good writing

01:23:03.541 --> 01:23:05.415
"60 times”?"

01:23:11.583 --> 01:23:13.540
Okay. Let's run.

01:23:18.166 --> 01:23:20.040
Did you saw that?

01:23:20.166 --> 01:23:25.665
- Where are all the other pictures?
- I don't know.

01:23:25.791 --> 01:23:31.665
Look. You've got sand in your toes
and in your hair and in your ears.

01:23:31.791 --> 01:23:34.624
Well, I guess it's a good time
for a bath then.

01:23:36.416 --> 01:23:40.874
But Mommy didn't move those things.
What are those things?

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:43.290
They're picture hooks.

01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:49.207
Mommy moved all the pictures
but not the picture hooks.

01:23:49.333 --> 01:23:52.249
- I'll take a quick shower.
- Yeah. Make it quick.

01:23:54.333 --> 01:23:56.790
Why would Mommy do that?

01:23:58.708 --> 01:24:01.165
I don't know, sweetie.

01:24:06.791 --> 01:24:10.207
Hi. This is Ted.
I can't play today, Dave.

01:24:10.333 --> 01:24:12.290
Yeah, my wife's left me.

01:24:13.416 --> 01:24:16.624
No, no. I'm okay.

01:24:19.791 --> 01:24:22.207
Yeah. All right. Yeah.

01:24:22.333 --> 01:24:25.957
I'll see you then. Bye.

01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:32.624
Where the fuck is my wife?

01:24:32.750 --> 01:24:34.707
- I don't know.
- Don't lie to me.

01:24:37.333 --> 01:24:40.707
Jesus!

01:24:40.833 --> 01:24:42.707
Christ!

01:24:42.833 --> 01:24:45.749
I hit you with an open hand...
with the flat of my hand!

01:24:45.875 --> 01:24:48.207
You clench your fist,
you punch me in the nose?

01:24:48.333 --> 01:24:51.124
- Jesus Christ!
- I'm sorry. Marion said

01:24:51.250 --> 01:24:54.540
"Marion said”? If she thinks"

01:24:54.666 --> 01:24:57.332
to get custody of Ruth,
she's got another think coming.

01:24:57.458 --> 01:25:01.832
She doesn't expect to get custody of Ruth.
She has no intention of trying.

01:25:01.958 --> 01:25:07.290
- She told you that?
- She told me everything I'm telling you.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.874
What kind of mother doesn't even try

01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.332
I don't know.
She didn't tell me that.

01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:22.707
God.

01:25:24.541 --> 01:25:26.499
Okay. Okay.

01:25:28.958 --> 01:25:31.082
Christ.

01:25:31.208 --> 01:25:34.457
Why... Why did she have to take all
of the photographs? There're negatives.

01:25:34.583 --> 01:25:38.957
She could have taken the negatives
and had prints of her own made.

01:25:40.041 --> 01:25:43.874
- The hell she did.
- Go look for yourself.

01:25:47.416 --> 01:25:52.665
She can't have the photographs

01:25:52.791 --> 01:25:57.040
They were my sons too.
I should have half the photographs,

01:25:57.166 --> 01:26:00.457
- Ruth should have some of the photos.
- Marion said you'd say that.

01:26:02.291 --> 01:26:06.124
Oh. Well, obviously,
she went to New York.

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:08.540
- I doubt it.
- What do you know, Eddie?

01:26:08.666 --> 01:26:14.540
That's the only place she could go.
I even know where in the city she is.

01:26:14.666 --> 01:26:16.915
You don't have an imagination, Eddie.

01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:22.207
- Christ.
- Aren't you planning on getting

01:26:22.333 --> 01:26:24.582
That Marion's question,
or is that your question?

01:26:25.666 --> 01:26:30.124
- It's mine.
- Eddie, just stick to what Marion

01:26:30.250 --> 01:26:35.124
She didn't tell me to get the photo.
That was my idea.

01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:38.457
- I was thinking of Ruth.
- Yeah. I know you were.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.999
Thank you. You want a drink?

01:26:45.125 --> 01:26:49.207
No.

01:26:50.333 --> 01:26:52.749
- What day is tomorrow, Saturday?
- Yeah.

01:26:52.875 --> 01:26:58.082
I want you out of here by tomorrow.
Sunday at the latest.

01:26:58.208 --> 01:27:02.290
Alice can take you.

01:27:02.416 --> 01:27:06.040
What about this one? Tell it!

01:27:06.166 --> 01:27:09.624
I'm sorry, Ruth. I don't know.
Okay? I just...

01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:14.874
Look here, Thomas in the tall hat.
Timothy is trying to reach Thomas's hat.

01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:20.874
Timothy can't reach Thomas's hat,
'cause Thomas is standing on a ball.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.790
- Was the fight in the picture?
- No. The fight was after

01:27:24.916 --> 01:27:28.207
Okay. We're gonna go watch a movie.
Yes. We're gonna go.

01:27:28.333 --> 01:27:30.582
We're gonna go pick a video.
Yes, we are.

01:27:30.708 --> 01:27:33.749
- Ruthie, stop it!
- No! No!

01:27:33.875 --> 01:27:35.749
- Stop it!
- No!

01:27:42.708 --> 01:27:44.665
- What?
- What have you done to Alice, Eddie?

01:27:44.791 --> 01:27:47.540
I didn't do anything.
She was crying when I first got here.

01:27:47.666 --> 01:27:50.832
I've been asking her what's wrong,
and she won't even talk to me.

01:27:55.375 --> 01:27:58.082
Where's Ruthie?

01:27:58.208 --> 01:28:02.499
- She's asleep.
- She was crying.

01:28:06.791 --> 01:28:10.999
I'm sorry, Alice,
for springing all of this on you.

01:28:11.125 --> 01:28:14.624
- Fuck you, Ted.
- I appreciate you pickin' up the slack.

01:28:17.625 --> 01:28:22.374
I've spent years trying to get over
my own fucked-up family.

01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.082
And I've done
the best I could with Ruth.

01:28:25.208 --> 01:28:28.040
No.

01:28:28.166 --> 01:28:32.457
No. I just can't anymore.
I'm gonna quit. I quit.

01:28:33.541 --> 01:28:36.374
And you should have
the decency to quit too.

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.207
It's too late for me to quit, Alice.
I just got fired.

01:28:39.333 --> 01:28:42.540
I never knew you were such
a superior person, Alice.

01:28:42.666 --> 01:28:46.124
Alice has been superior to me
all summer. Haven't you, Alice?

01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:49.915
I am morally superior to you, Eddie.
I know that much.

01:28:50.041 --> 01:28:53.957
"Morally superior."
What a concept.

01:28:54.083 --> 01:28:58.540
Don't you ever feel
morally superior, Eddie?

01:28:58.666 --> 01:29:02.915
Yeah. You see? Everyone feels
morally superior to someone.

01:29:03.041 --> 01:29:05.665
Fuck you guys.

01:29:05.791 --> 01:29:08.540
There goes my ride
to the ferry.

01:29:08.666 --> 01:29:11.915
You're a smart boy, Eddie. You'll think
of someone to give you a ride.

01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:21.707
You want a drink?

01:29:21.833 --> 01:29:23.707
No, thanks.

01:29:23.833 --> 01:29:26.249
Oh, for Chrissake. Have a beer.

01:29:30.708 --> 01:29:32.665
Jesus. Look at this yard.

01:29:36.416 --> 01:29:41.082
Cannot believe she doesn't want
custody of her own daughter.

01:29:41.208 --> 01:29:44.124
What kind of mother
leaves her daughter?

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:47.290
I don't know her well enough
to judge her.

01:29:47.416 --> 01:29:49.457
Let me tell you something, Eddie.

01:29:49.583 --> 01:29:53.249
I don't know her well enough
to judge her either.

01:29:53.375 --> 01:29:56.790
Yeah, well, don't forget,
it's you she's really leaving.

01:29:56.916 --> 01:29:59.915
Guess she knew you pretty well.

01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:06.915
Well enough to judge me,
you mean? Certainly.

01:30:07.041 --> 01:30:11.415
But then, she's leaving you too,
isn't she, Eddie?

01:30:15.541 --> 01:30:19.332
You don't expect her to call you up
for a secret rendezvous, do you?

01:30:21.458 --> 01:30:25.124
- No. I don't expect to hear from her.
- No, me neither.

01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:28.582
I have drawings of her.

01:30:30.666 --> 01:30:33.915
I drew her long ago,
before the accident.

01:30:35.208 --> 01:30:40.957
She was so... so incredible.
So fucking beautiful. Amazing.

01:30:42.041 --> 01:30:44.499
You should have known her then.

01:30:45.875 --> 01:30:47.790
Oh, Marion.

01:30:49.875 --> 01:30:52.540
She hated to pose for me.

01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:59.915
These are the only drawings I kept.

01:31:02.541 --> 01:31:05.207
I was never good enough
to draw Marion.

01:31:05.333 --> 01:31:09.624
I didn't know how to.
I didn't have the ability, I guess.

01:31:14.375 --> 01:31:17.124
You want one? You can have one.

01:31:17.250 --> 01:31:19.207
No. Ruth should have them.

01:31:19.333 --> 01:31:21.707
That's a good idea.

01:31:21.833 --> 01:31:25.915
You're full of good ideas, Eddie.

01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:28.957
Wrong cubes.

01:31:45.541 --> 01:31:47.415
Marion?

01:31:47.541 --> 01:31:49.790
Jesus, aren't you the optimist?

01:31:53.583 --> 01:31:56.124
Forget the light, Eddie.

01:31:57.250 --> 01:31:59.582
This story's better in the dark.

01:32:04.708 --> 01:32:08.124
- What story?
- You told me you asked Marion

01:32:08.250 --> 01:32:11.540
but Marion can't handle this story.

01:32:11.666 --> 01:32:14.332
Turns her to stone just thinking about it.

01:32:14.458 --> 01:32:17.790
Remember, you turned her to stone
just asking her about it.

01:32:18.875 --> 01:32:20.832
I remember.

01:32:22.541 --> 01:32:24.499
Go on.

01:32:28.125 --> 01:32:30.082
Well, here's the deal.

01:32:32.833 --> 01:32:37.624
Thomas had his driver's license,
but Timothy did not.

01:32:39.916 --> 01:32:44.207
Tommy was 17 and...
been driving for a year.

01:32:44.333 --> 01:32:50.082
Timmy was 15. He had only started
to take driving lessons.

01:32:51.166 --> 01:32:55.082
It was Ted's opinion that Timmy,
who was only learning,

01:32:55.208 --> 01:33:00.374
was already a more attentive student
than Thomas ever had been.

01:33:02.458 --> 01:33:06.624
Timmy studied
the driving manual diligently.

01:33:07.750 --> 01:33:11.415
He was a more patient driver than Thomas.

01:33:11.541 --> 01:33:15.707
Not that Tommy was a bad driver.
Tommy was a good driver.

01:33:17.458 --> 01:33:21.457
He was alert, confident.

01:33:22.583 --> 01:33:26.124
He had excellent reflexes.

01:33:27.833 --> 01:33:33.749
And he was cynical enough to assume...
as Ted had instructed him...

01:33:34.833 --> 01:33:38.665
that every other driver is a bad driver.

01:33:38.791 --> 01:33:41.707
Who taught to you drive, Eddie?

01:33:41.833 --> 01:33:45.040
My dad.

01:33:45.166 --> 01:33:47.540
Well, good for him.

01:33:47.666 --> 01:33:51.457
Tell him for me,
he did an excellent job, would you?

01:33:52.833 --> 01:33:54.790
Okay.

01:34:10.625 --> 01:34:13.290
Keep... Keep going.

01:34:14.375 --> 01:34:20.207
We were out west, actually,
and it was after a long day of skiing.

01:34:20.333 --> 01:34:23.624
It was snowing...
a wet, thick snow.

01:34:25.833 --> 01:34:30.207
At 17 and 15, respectively,

01:34:30.333 --> 01:34:34.540
Thomas and Timothy
could ski the pants off their parents.

01:34:34.666 --> 01:34:40.290
That day, in fact, Ted and Marion
had retired to the bar at the ski resort

01:34:40.416 --> 01:34:43.040
where they were waiting
for a very long time...

01:34:43.166 --> 01:34:46.915
for Thomas and Timothy
to finish their last run...

01:34:47.041 --> 01:34:50.540
and the last run after that.

01:34:50.666 --> 01:34:54.249
I get the picture.
You were drunk.

01:34:56.208 --> 01:34:59.624
Well, that...

01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:03.374
that was one aspect
of what would become trivial...

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:07.790
in the... area of the ongoing argument
between Marion and Ted.

01:35:07.916 --> 01:35:13.832
I mean, Marion said that Ted was drunk,
although in his view, he wasn't.

01:35:13.958 --> 01:35:18.207
Marion, while not drunk,
certainly had had more to drink

01:35:18.333 --> 01:35:22.457
Besides, Tommy had not been drinking.
He had his license.

01:35:22.583 --> 01:35:25.874
There was no disagreement
as to who among them should be the driver.

01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.957
And, brothers being brothers,

01:35:29.083 --> 01:35:33.124
Timmy sat beside him
in the passenger seat.

01:35:34.208 --> 01:35:36.207
And as for the parents,

01:35:36.333 --> 01:35:41.290
Ted and Marion... sat in the backseat.

01:35:44.250 --> 01:35:46.915
Ted and Marion
began to quarrel...

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:50.540
about the best route
back to the hotel.

01:35:50.666 --> 01:35:54.624
There was gonna have to be a left turn
no matter how Tommy did it.

01:35:54.750 --> 01:35:58.915
So, Tommy moves into the centre lane.

01:35:59.041 --> 01:36:02.082
It's, a turning lane.
It's not a passing lane.

01:36:02.208 --> 01:36:05.207
He puts on his blinker,

01:36:05.333 --> 01:36:10.082
not knowing that both lights
are covered with wet, sticky snow...

01:36:10.208 --> 01:36:14.207
that his father failed to clear off
at the same time his father...

01:36:14.333 --> 01:36:16.957
failed to clear off the rear window.

01:36:19.458 --> 01:36:25.332
Any cars coming up from behind Tommy's
car can't see the directional signals...

01:36:25.458 --> 01:36:27.332
or the brake lights or the tail lights.

01:36:27.458 --> 01:36:31.832
The car is not visible,

01:36:31.958 --> 01:36:35.874
or it's visible only
at the last second to any...

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.790
anyone approaching from behind.

01:36:44.541 --> 01:36:49.374
And then, the interior of the car

01:36:49.500 --> 01:36:53.374
It's the headlights from the car
coming up from behind.

01:37:05.125 --> 01:37:08.207
The snow plough cut the car
almost perfectly in half.

01:37:16.666 --> 01:37:22.332
Tommy was killed by the steering column.
Crushed his chest. Died instantly.

01:37:23.458 --> 01:37:26.665
And Ted...

01:37:26.791 --> 01:37:30.624
was trapped in the backseat
for all of 20 minutes.

01:37:33.583 --> 01:37:35.457
He...

01:37:35.583 --> 01:37:41.499
He couldn't see Tommy, but he knew
he was dead because Marion could see him.

01:37:42.625 --> 01:37:46.040
She couldn't see Timmy.

01:37:46.166 --> 01:37:50.832
Ted, however, could see
that Timmy was still breathing.

01:37:50.958 --> 01:37:55.749
Ted could also see that the snow plough,
as it cut the car in half,

01:37:55.875 --> 01:37:59.915
also cut Timmy's left leg off
at the thigh.

01:38:07.333 --> 01:38:11.624
Timothy Cole bled to death
of a severed femoral artery.

01:38:15.708 --> 01:38:19.040
Marion knew that Tommy was dead,

01:38:19.166 --> 01:38:22.207
but only that Timmy
had been carried from the wreckage,

01:38:22.333 --> 01:38:25.749
hopefully... to the hospital.

01:38:26.833 --> 01:38:30.207
And then Marion,

01:38:30.333 --> 01:38:33.124
she sees Timmy's shoe in the wreckage.

01:38:34.375 --> 01:38:38.707
"Oh, look. Timmy's shoe.
He's gonna need his shoe."

01:38:41.333 --> 01:38:45.915
And she walks over to it,
reaches down to pick it up.

01:38:53.333 --> 01:38:56.749
Ted... Ted wanted to stop her.

01:39:03.333 --> 01:39:08.374
Talk about turned to stone.

01:39:10.666 --> 01:39:14.124
I couldn't move.
I couldn't even speak.

01:39:31.375 --> 01:39:34.874
And that was when Ted
allowed his wife to discover...

01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:39.582
that her younger son's shoe
was attached...

01:39:42.625 --> 01:39:45.082
to a leg.

01:39:47.541 --> 01:39:53.457
And that was when Marion realized
that Timmy was gone... too.

01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:02.040
And that...

01:40:02.166 --> 01:40:05.332
that is the end of the story.

01:40:36.958 --> 01:40:39.915
I hired you, Eddie,
because you look like Thomas.

01:40:42.250 --> 01:40:44.707
I gave her you.

01:40:53.125 --> 01:40:55.624
See you in the morning, Eddie.

01:41:31.750 --> 01:41:35.749
It's Eduardo.
What's Eduardo doing here?

01:41:36.833 --> 01:41:39.707
I don't know. Maybe Mrs. Vaughn
hired him to kill you.

01:41:39.833 --> 01:41:42.582
No, no. Not... Not Eduardo.

01:41:43.666 --> 01:41:48.290
You don't see her
out there anywhere, do you?

01:41:48.416 --> 01:41:52.207
Maybe she's lying
underneath the truck.

01:41:52.333 --> 01:41:55.832
- I'm being serious, for Chrissake.
- So am I.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:05.332
Why... Why don't you go out there
and, see what he wants?

01:42:05.458 --> 01:42:08.957
Not me. I've been fired.

01:42:09.083 --> 01:42:12.457
- Oh, for Chrissake.
- What?

01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:15.957
Wha...

01:42:16.083 --> 01:42:19.415
At least go with me then.
I can't go out there alone.

01:42:19.541 --> 01:42:21.999
- Mrs. Vaughn fired me.
- Eduardo, Eduardo, Eduardo.

01:42:22.125 --> 01:42:24.415
Let me make sure I understand you.

01:42:24.541 --> 01:42:27.707
You think you saved my life,
and this cost you your job?

01:42:27.833 --> 01:42:31.582
Yes, I did save your life,
and it did cost me my job.

01:42:31.708 --> 01:42:35.290
I play squash regularly,
and I'm pretty fleet of foot,

01:42:35.416 --> 01:42:37.874
but I do... I do appreciate
your brave warning.

01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:43.124
How much money
are we talking about exactly?

01:42:44.750 --> 01:42:47.624
I was hoping you might
have some work for me.

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:55.790
Let me... Let me show you
where I want to put a pool.

01:42:56.875 --> 01:42:59.915
I want more lawn,
like an athletic field, you know?

01:43:00.041 --> 01:43:02.874
- Just pretty big.
- You want some lines

01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:07.082
No, no.
Just the size of an athletic field.

01:43:07.208 --> 01:43:11.290
That's a lotta lawn.
A lotta mowin'

01:43:11.416 --> 01:43:14.999
- And a lot of fertilizers.
- Yeah.

01:43:15.125 --> 01:43:19.290
Well, whatever you say.
I'm putting you in charge.

01:43:19.416 --> 01:43:21.915
What about your wife?

01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:28.915
- What about her?
- Does she work,

01:43:29.041 --> 01:43:31.040
Yeah, sure. Sure, she works.

01:43:31.166 --> 01:43:35.207
She cooks,
she look after our children.

01:43:36.333 --> 01:43:39.415
Maybe...
Maybe she'd like to clean my house.

01:43:39.541 --> 01:43:43.207
Or maybe she'd like
to cook for me and...

01:43:43.333 --> 01:43:46.040
look after my daughter, Ruth.

01:43:46.166 --> 01:43:48.124
- Sure. I'll ask her.
- Yeah?

01:43:49.208 --> 01:43:52.207
Good. Good. Excellent.

01:43:53.333 --> 01:43:57.332
Gotta do something about
these straggly flower beds too.

01:43:57.458 --> 01:43:59.874
- Oh.
- You can start today, Eduardo.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:05.540
You can begin by taking
my former assistant to Orient Point, hmm?

01:44:07.041 --> 01:44:10.707
Immediately. Before breakfast?

01:44:27.083 --> 01:44:29.915
Well, you're a fairly good driver, Eddie.

01:44:32.208 --> 01:44:36.457
About Marion,
there's another thing you should know.

01:44:37.541 --> 01:44:40.790
Even before the accident...
I mean, even...

01:44:40.916 --> 01:44:44.040
even if there had never been
an accident,

01:44:44.166 --> 01:44:46.040
she still would be difficult.

01:44:48.833 --> 01:44:50.957
I don't believe it.

01:44:55.166 --> 01:44:59.540
About the shoe,
it was a basketball shoe...

01:44:59.666 --> 01:45:02.290
an "Air Jordan," I think he called it.

01:45:07.500 --> 01:45:10.374
Specific details, Eddie.

01:45:11.833 --> 01:45:13.790
Specific details.
