WEBVTT

00:05.538 --> 00:08.440
Hey, Cap, ran into
your old buddy Crossbones.

00:08.442 --> 00:10.442
Where is Cap?

00:10.444 --> 00:13.178
He should be
around here somewhere.

00:13.180 --> 00:15.447
All this time,
Cap's never unpacked?

00:15.449 --> 00:17.116
Friday,
locate Captain America.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.817
<i>I'm not seeing him.</i>

00:18.819 --> 00:21.186
<i>His identification card</i>
<i>is inactive.</i>

00:21.188 --> 00:23.555
Friday, I need all
of his last known locations.

00:23.557 --> 00:27.893
Whoa, Black Widow.
Just because his card's down
doesn't mean something's wrong.

00:27.895 --> 00:30.562
<i>I see that Captain America</i>
<i>filed a travel log</i>
<i>this morning,</i>

00:30.564 --> 00:32.831
<i>but he didn't register</i>
<i>where he was going.</i>

00:32.833 --> 00:34.867
Okay. That is weird.

00:34.869 --> 00:38.170
Cap always checks in
when he travels.

00:38.172 --> 00:40.706
So where is he?

00:40.708 --> 00:44.410
Cap! Cap, are you all right?

00:44.412 --> 00:46.245
[grunts]

00:46.247 --> 00:48.213
You have to get up. Cap!

00:49.215 --> 00:51.583
Bucky?

00:51.585 --> 00:53.585
[groans]
Where's my team?

00:53.587 --> 00:55.821
The Howling Commandos
are back at base.

00:55.823 --> 00:57.723
The Howling Commandos?

00:57.725 --> 01:00.659
But the Avengers are--
Wait. What year is this?

01:00.661 --> 01:03.395
That Hydra grenade
must've gone off
closer than I thought.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.897
It's 1944.

01:09.269 --> 01:10.869
[groans]

01:10.871 --> 01:13.372
And it'll be
1944 tomorrow,

01:13.374 --> 01:14.706
if we make it out of this.

01:14.708 --> 01:15.974
Uh-oh.
[blast]

01:18.378 --> 01:20.879
[grunts]

01:20.881 --> 01:23.215
[laughing]

01:23.217 --> 01:27.586
Baron Zemo?
The Hydra scientist, alive?

01:28.621 --> 01:30.689
Fire!

01:33.860 --> 01:35.360
[grunts]

01:39.265 --> 01:41.233
Sometimes I think
you're my guardian angel

01:41.235 --> 01:42.901
and not just my best friend.

01:42.903 --> 01:45.270
Best friend?
Bucky, I'm--

01:45.272 --> 01:46.605
I'm not myself.

01:48.241 --> 01:49.608
This has gotta be a dream.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.877
We're here
to capture Baron Zemo.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.645
So what say
we finish the mission?

01:55.982 --> 01:57.883
It'll be good to work
with you again.

01:57.885 --> 01:59.785
[grunts]

02:00.720 --> 02:02.287
[grunts]

02:02.289 --> 02:04.790
Captain America and Bucky.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.825
You've come looking for me,

02:06.827 --> 02:09.794
but you've only found
your own demise.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.731
[grunts]

02:12.733 --> 02:14.399
[grunting]

02:14.401 --> 02:17.035
Cover me, you fools!

02:23.409 --> 02:25.477
[grunts]

02:25.479 --> 02:27.446
[both]
Huh?

02:27.448 --> 02:29.648
We walked
right into this one.

02:31.000 --> 02:37.074

02:44.330 --> 02:46.932
Bucky, get down!
[grunting]

02:47.934 --> 02:49.668
[whirring]

02:52.539 --> 02:54.907
[grunts]

02:58.545 --> 03:00.012
Aahh!

03:02.982 --> 03:04.850
Saved my life again.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.352
That's another one
I owe you, Cap.

03:07.354 --> 03:09.454
You up for
a little light jogging?

03:09.456 --> 03:10.822
I think we know
where he's headed.

03:10.824 --> 03:13.525
Another Cap and Bucky
fun run.

03:16.396 --> 03:19.698
Whoa. You ever see a creepy
old castle like this before?

03:19.700 --> 03:22.568
I-- I think I have.

03:22.570 --> 03:26.838
I wish I could explain this.
It feels like déjà vu,
or I've traveled back in time.

03:26.840 --> 03:29.541
Traveled back in time?
Okay.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.010
You either really
hit your head hard, or now
you're just pulling my leg.

03:32.012 --> 03:34.346
I honestly don't know.

03:34.348 --> 03:38.116
What I do know
is this is Zemo's
personal Hydra outpost.

03:42.689 --> 03:45.324
We'll have to fight
our way in.

03:45.326 --> 03:48.560
No. I think I know a way
to sneak us in.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.095
Then lead the way.

03:59.005 --> 04:00.505
[grunts]

04:00.507 --> 04:02.941
[chuckles]
Cap smash.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.911
Hustle, Rogers.
Get the lead out.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.813
Everything here
looks familiar.

04:08.748 --> 04:11.516
Look out!
[grunts]

04:12.619 --> 04:15.587
That same door caught me
off guard last time too.

04:15.589 --> 04:19.625
Last time. I was here
to stop Baron Zemo
from doing something.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.026
Why can't I remember?

04:21.028 --> 04:22.694
Are you sure
you're okay, Cap?

04:22.696 --> 04:24.563
Maybe we oughta turn back.
No.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.998
I'm fine. We should
stick with the mission.

04:37.710 --> 04:40.479
Can't keep the Baron waiting.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.415
Yeah. We wouldn't
wanna be rude.
Another trap?

04:43.417 --> 04:45.417
No, I-- I'm just...

04:45.419 --> 04:47.552
It's really good to be
on a mission with you again.

04:47.554 --> 04:51.089
Likewise. But don't get
all sentimental on me.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.792
Cap, hustle!

04:53.794 --> 04:54.993
[grunts]

04:56.729 --> 04:58.030
[grunts]

04:59.399 --> 05:00.666
Show-off.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.068
[chuckles]
I like to make an entrance.

05:03.070 --> 05:05.671
Oh, great. Tony Stark's
rubbing off on me.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.673
[Baron Zemo]
Ah, Captain America.

05:07.675 --> 05:11.510
I see you've discovered
my home away from home.

05:11.512 --> 05:13.979
Zemo didn't know
we were coming last time.

05:13.981 --> 05:17.015
You can make this easy
on all of us, Zemo,
and give yourself up.

05:17.017 --> 05:20.752
[chuckling]
Well, where is the fun in that?

05:20.754 --> 05:23.855
Cap's ID may be off,
but the reverse trace
I put on it

05:23.857 --> 05:25.991
has its last known location
dead ahead.

05:25.993 --> 05:29.661
Or did you digging
through his sock drawer
already tell you that?

05:29.663 --> 05:31.863
Your machines are useful,
Iron Man,

05:31.865 --> 05:35.000
but don't mistake
knowing where Cap is
for knowing who he is.

05:35.002 --> 05:38.637
You think you know my pal Cap
better than I do?

05:38.639 --> 05:41.106
Did you know his favorite
ice cream is butter pecan?

05:41.108 --> 05:42.708
No, it isn't.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.843
You just picked a flavor
old people like.

05:44.845 --> 05:48.714
Yeah, looks like Cap found
something as old as he is.

05:52.452 --> 05:55.520
One slightly used
European castle.

05:57.724 --> 06:00.892
I'll admit, this wouldn't
be my vacation spot.

06:00.894 --> 06:03.562
But to each his own.
The castle's old.

06:03.564 --> 06:05.630
The whole thing
is structurally unsound.

06:05.632 --> 06:07.866
Which is probably why
there's no one here.

06:07.868 --> 06:10.068
Are you sure about that?

06:11.637 --> 06:13.872
[beeping]

06:15.875 --> 06:19.911
Well, I guess I can cross
"storm a castle"
off my bucket list.

06:28.554 --> 06:31.089
[both grunting]

06:31.091 --> 06:33.191
[Baron Zemo]
You're good against traps.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.726
Very good.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.897
But are you good enough
against my elites?

06:38.899 --> 06:41.900
Well, I guess we're gonna
find out, won't we?

06:41.902 --> 06:43.602
[Baron Zemo]
Hydra, attack!

06:45.705 --> 06:46.905
[grunting]

06:54.714 --> 06:56.915
[grunting]

07:08.694 --> 07:09.961
[grunting continues]

07:09.963 --> 07:11.096
[Baron Zemo]
Missed me!

07:12.899 --> 07:14.866
[yells]

07:14.868 --> 07:16.034
Are you sure about that?

07:16.036 --> 07:18.036
[yells]

07:18.038 --> 07:19.971
[yells]

07:21.040 --> 07:22.641
Aaahhh!

07:22.643 --> 07:24.042
Bucky!
[grunts]

07:25.578 --> 07:27.679
Take him to my lab.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.916
No! Bucky!

07:30.918 --> 07:33.985
And him, you can destroy.

07:38.124 --> 07:40.125
[yells]

07:40.127 --> 07:41.560
Scanning for heat signatures.

07:41.562 --> 07:43.795
I'm picking one up
straight ahead.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.730
Just might be
our missing Captain.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.901
[grunting]

07:49.903 --> 07:52.704
[grunting continues]

07:59.812 --> 08:02.147
Bucky! Where's Bucky?

08:02.149 --> 08:05.650
That's definitely Cap.
But why is he looking
at us like that?

08:05.652 --> 08:07.919
Bucky... Bucky...

08:07.921 --> 08:09.821
Hydra... Stop...

08:09.823 --> 08:12.090
Stop Hydra. Stop Hydra.

08:12.092 --> 08:14.059
[yelling]

08:15.761 --> 08:19.064
[yells]
Cap, it's me, Tony.

08:21.133 --> 08:24.202
[grunts]
Yours and everybody's
favorite Avenger?

08:24.204 --> 08:25.871
[grunting]

08:25.873 --> 08:28.173
<i>Kapitan, es tut mir leid!</i>

08:31.143 --> 08:32.711
[both grunting]

08:32.712 --> 08:34.044
[grunts]
Aah!

08:34.047 --> 08:36.047
[grunts]

08:36.049 --> 08:38.015
Is Cap hearing
what I'm saying?

08:38.018 --> 08:39.150
It has to be
mind control.

08:39.152 --> 08:41.820
We have to figure out
what kind.

08:41.822 --> 08:44.890
I don't think he's
gonna sit still
for an examination.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.224
[grunts]

08:46.226 --> 08:47.659
[grunts]

08:47.661 --> 08:48.860
[groaning]

08:48.862 --> 08:51.296
Then we'll have to make him.

08:51.298 --> 08:53.899
[grunting]

08:56.836 --> 08:59.871
It doesn't matter
how many of you
Hydra throws at me.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.239
You're not keeping Bucky.

09:01.241 --> 09:03.808
I won't leave him behind!
You hear me?

09:03.810 --> 09:06.177
Come on, Cap.
I don't wanna have to hurt you.

09:06.179 --> 09:09.114
[shouting gibberish]

09:11.317 --> 09:13.285
What language
is he speaking?

09:15.154 --> 09:17.088
[grunts]
Tony, now!

09:17.090 --> 09:19.257
Sorry, Cap.
Aah!

09:19.259 --> 09:20.959
[groaning]

09:23.162 --> 09:26.698
I'll apologize to him again
after he wakes up.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.200
No sign of any marks.

09:29.202 --> 09:31.603
There's no device
on him either.

09:31.605 --> 09:35.040
But you heard him.
Cap was screaming
about Hydra and Bucky.

09:35.042 --> 09:38.276
Maybe he was put
under some kind
of regressive hypnosis.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.913
It's a demanding technique.
Fell out of favor in the 1950s.

09:41.915 --> 09:46.117
And yet, aren't the old ways
always the best?

09:46.119 --> 09:49.955
It depends on the ways.
We haven't met, Mr.--

09:49.957 --> 09:53.024
Uh, Baron. Helmet Zemo.

09:53.026 --> 09:56.261
This castle belonged
to my father,
Heinrich Zemo.

09:56.263 --> 09:59.297
Baron Zemo.
Hydra scientist.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.933
Invented a crude glue
called Adhesive X.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.635
He's one of Cap's
lower-level baddies.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.804
[Baron Zemo]
My father was a genius!

10:05.806 --> 10:09.441
He would've changed the world
if not for Captain America's
meddling.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.977
I have spent my life
rebuilding his legacy.

10:11.979 --> 10:15.413
And now that Captain Rogers
is under my hypnotic trance,

10:15.415 --> 10:19.217
he will help me recreate
my father's greatest triumph.

10:19.219 --> 10:23.655
Let me guess. Cap stumbled
onto Daddy's plans for glue,
and you wanna corner the market.

10:23.657 --> 10:26.291
Do not insult me.
I may not have been able

10:26.293 --> 10:28.793
to recreate
a super soldier serum,

10:28.795 --> 10:31.463
but my efforts
were not without results.

10:31.465 --> 10:34.733
But alas, my failed version
has side effects.

10:34.735 --> 10:37.302
Monstrous side effects.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.237
[soldiers grunting, groaning]

10:42.642 --> 10:44.643
[growling]

10:44.645 --> 10:48.013
S.H.I.E.L.D. clearly missed
something in Zemo's file.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.982
[monsters breathing heavily]

10:50.984 --> 10:52.417
Finish them.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.352
[monsters growling]

11:04.930 --> 11:07.332
[grunting]

11:17.376 --> 11:18.810
No!

11:18.812 --> 11:20.545
[grunts]

11:20.547 --> 11:24.182
Okay. I did not
see that coming.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.021
But that I did see.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.289
[yelling]

11:31.291 --> 11:33.525
[Black Widow grunting]

11:36.328 --> 11:38.963
Do not forget
your mission, Captain.

11:38.965 --> 11:43.134
You must find Bucky.
You must save him.

11:44.070 --> 11:47.072
Bucky.
You must save him.

11:47.074 --> 11:49.641
Run, Captain! Run!

11:49.643 --> 11:51.309
Bucky, hang on!

11:51.311 --> 11:54.446
Bucky!
Bucky, can you hear me?

11:55.414 --> 11:59.584
[Bucky, distant]
Help me-e-e!

11:59.586 --> 12:02.754
Last time, Bucky and I
went this way, but...

12:02.756 --> 12:06.191
It was here.
I remember it.

12:06.193 --> 12:09.894
Zemo sicced
those Hydra crumbs on me
while he escaped this way.

12:13.099 --> 12:16.000
Bucky, I'm coming!
[echoing]

12:19.171 --> 12:21.840
[powering up]

12:21.842 --> 12:24.409
This was Zemo's
secret laboratory.

12:24.411 --> 12:27.579
I remember everything now.

12:27.581 --> 12:28.680
Bucky!

12:30.683 --> 12:34.085
Bucky, what have
they done to you?

12:34.087 --> 12:37.455
[Baron Zemo laughing]
Captain America,

12:37.457 --> 12:41.960
the last man alive
who knew how to enter
my father's secret lab.

12:41.962 --> 12:46.097
I knew not how to find the lab,
but I knew how to find you.

12:46.099 --> 12:49.901
To hypnotize and trick you
into retracing your footsteps

12:49.903 --> 12:52.403
and leading me here.
[chuckles]

12:52.405 --> 12:55.807
I may have failed to perfect
a super soldier serum,

12:55.809 --> 12:58.143
but my father succeeded.

13:04.416 --> 13:08.052
Only two appear viable.
But it will do.

13:08.054 --> 13:13.558
And to think I never would have
found it without you, Captain.

13:14.760 --> 13:17.128
Hail Hydra.

13:17.130 --> 13:20.498
[grunting, groaning]
[bones cracking]

13:26.572 --> 13:28.973
[yelling]

13:30.476 --> 13:35.146
[screaming]

13:39.785 --> 13:42.821
These things
are starting to slow down.
[growling]

13:45.758 --> 13:47.659
Yeah, you're right.
[yelling]

13:47.661 --> 13:51.095
Zemo Junior's serum's
only temporary.

13:51.097 --> 13:53.198
I've got an idea.

13:53.200 --> 13:54.866
[grunting]

13:54.868 --> 13:56.868
How about a lift?

14:05.477 --> 14:07.846
[Iron Man]
When in doubt, drop
something heavy on them.

14:07.848 --> 14:09.380
[grunts]

14:11.116 --> 14:12.517
[growling]

14:14.687 --> 14:16.421
[grunting]

14:17.990 --> 14:20.291
[distant screaming]

14:22.027 --> 14:26.030
If that's Cap, I'm gonna glue
my fist to Zemo's face.

14:29.501 --> 14:31.569
[Black Widow]
Zemo.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.571
You must forgive my outburst.

14:33.573 --> 14:35.707
The transformation
may not be pleasant,

14:35.709 --> 14:38.676
but the results
are well worth it.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.411
A formula that works.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.814
My father's serum
belongs to me now--

14:42.816 --> 14:45.350
me and the army
I shall raise with it.

14:45.352 --> 14:48.019
Zemo, let Captain America go.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.989
I no longer have any need
for Captain Rogers.

14:50.991 --> 14:53.925
But since he imprisoned
my father,

14:53.927 --> 14:58.496
it's only fitting
to imprison him
inside his own mind.

14:58.498 --> 15:01.933
As for you,
your end will be swift.

15:01.935 --> 15:06.137
Your end is now!
[yelling]

15:07.773 --> 15:12.210
You will not fare well
against a real super soldier!

15:12.212 --> 15:17.181
There's only one
super soldier in this room,
and it ain't you!

15:17.183 --> 15:19.183
[grunting]

15:25.958 --> 15:27.525
[grunting]
[groaning]

15:27.527 --> 15:29.694
[groaning]

15:31.063 --> 15:32.697
[groans]

15:34.266 --> 15:36.367
Do not feel sorrow.

15:36.369 --> 15:38.903
You could never hope
to defeat my genius.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.605
It is unparalleled.

15:43.275 --> 15:45.777
I don't know
what's going on out there,
but it doesn't matter.

15:45.779 --> 15:49.047
I gotta get Bucky outta here
before they bring
the whole place down.

15:52.217 --> 15:55.453
Let's take this fight outside.
[groaning]

15:55.455 --> 15:57.622
[grunting]

15:57.624 --> 16:00.825
I'm not taking
any more chances
with this evil grape.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.860
Don't let up on him.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.797
[grunts]

16:12.938 --> 16:13.972
[grunts]

16:13.974 --> 16:16.774
You dented my ride.

16:16.776 --> 16:18.176
[groaning]

16:18.178 --> 16:20.611
Cap, is that you?

16:20.613 --> 16:23.181
Bucky! I was starting
to get worried that--

16:23.183 --> 16:25.183
You have to get out
of here, now!

16:25.185 --> 16:26.784
I know. We both do.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.486
This isn't what happened, Steve.

16:29.621 --> 16:30.722
[grunts]

16:35.694 --> 16:38.529
This isn't real.
You have to get out of here.

16:38.531 --> 16:39.764
[thud, rumbling]
Huh?

16:41.166 --> 16:42.233
[grunts]

16:47.506 --> 16:49.340
[grunts]

16:49.342 --> 16:51.542
Bucky!

16:51.544 --> 16:54.245
[grunting]

16:55.481 --> 16:57.115
I won't leave you.

16:57.117 --> 17:00.151
Cap, forget me.
Save yourself.

17:00.153 --> 17:03.354
[grunting]

17:03.356 --> 17:06.057
I won't let it happen again!

17:06.059 --> 17:09.060
I lost you once.
I lost so much.

17:09.061 --> 17:11.396
I will always be
your best friend,

17:11.397 --> 17:13.564
but you gotta snap outta this.

17:13.566 --> 17:17.201
I need you to live.
[echoing]

17:17.203 --> 17:20.371
[groans]
Hmm. You're right.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.373
I have to let you go.

17:22.375 --> 17:26.844
Now go and show him
what a kid from Brooklyn can do.

17:26.846 --> 17:30.648
Thanks for saving me, again.

17:32.184 --> 17:33.551
[panting]

17:33.553 --> 17:36.387
[grunting]

17:49.601 --> 17:50.968
[grunts]

17:56.608 --> 17:59.010
[grunting]

18:00.779 --> 18:03.414
We only just met,
Iron Man,

18:03.416 --> 18:05.550
but this is good-bye.

18:05.552 --> 18:08.386
Zemo!
[grunting]

18:08.388 --> 18:10.721
Get away from my friends.

18:10.723 --> 18:12.723
Look who's back
in the game.

18:12.725 --> 18:15.860
Impossible!
You broke my mind control.

18:15.862 --> 18:18.362
Well, it matters not.
You've lost,

18:18.364 --> 18:21.365
while I preserve
my father's legacy.

18:21.367 --> 18:23.768
Copying other people's science
and using it for evil

18:23.770 --> 18:26.437
doesn't sound like very much
of a legacy to me!

18:26.439 --> 18:29.273
[both grunting]

18:34.313 --> 18:36.547
Do not pretend to be superior.

18:36.549 --> 18:38.716
I will honor my father.

18:38.718 --> 18:42.753
Use his science
to bring humanity
to its next advanced stage,

18:42.755 --> 18:45.790
and cut away the dead weight
that holds me back.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.992
[grunting]

18:47.994 --> 18:49.327
[grunts]

18:49.329 --> 18:51.329
[screaming]

18:51.331 --> 18:54.499
On behalf of the dead weight,
no, thanks!

18:54.501 --> 18:56.467
[grunts]

18:56.469 --> 18:59.303
Good to see you back, Steve.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.305
Good to be back.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.841
We can still end this
peacefully, Zemo,

19:03.843 --> 19:07.345
but the Avengers are never
going to let men like you
control this world.

19:07.347 --> 19:11.849
Then, by all means,
try and stop me.

19:22.995 --> 19:26.364
[both grunting]

19:26.366 --> 19:29.433
The super soldier serum!
No!

19:29.435 --> 19:30.935
What have you done?

19:33.539 --> 19:35.339
[grunts]

19:35.341 --> 19:36.941
Zemo, leave it!

19:36.943 --> 19:38.943
The entire cliff
is going to collapse!

19:38.945 --> 19:41.445
The serum must be mine!

19:41.447 --> 19:43.714
The legacy
of the House of Zemo!

19:43.716 --> 19:45.716
Let me go!

19:45.718 --> 19:47.418
Zemo!

19:50.722 --> 19:53.524
[grunts]

19:53.526 --> 19:55.059
I got you.

19:56.862 --> 20:00.398
[Iron Man]
And I got you.

20:00.400 --> 20:03.734
This count as you
saving Cap's life,
or is this one mine?

20:03.736 --> 20:06.971
As far as I'm concerned,
you're both lifesavers.

20:11.410 --> 20:15.846
Not detecting anything
except a bunch of water
and a bunch of rock.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.516
Zemo's hypnosis
may have been old-fashioned,

20:18.518 --> 20:20.718
but that technique is foolproof.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.887
How did you manage
to break free?

20:22.889 --> 20:24.889
I didn't.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.958
A friend saved me.

20:28.660 --> 20:30.895
[Black Widow]
This new look is impressive.

20:30.897 --> 20:33.931
We never pegged you
as the type to... decorate.

20:33.933 --> 20:36.567
Thought you'd
never unpack.

20:36.569 --> 20:38.669
Is that what
you two thought?

20:38.671 --> 20:40.438
It's like you don't
know me at all.

20:40.440 --> 20:43.007
I guess seeing Zemo
spend his whole life

20:43.009 --> 20:45.710
trying to recreate history
made me realize

20:45.712 --> 20:48.746
I wanna honor my past,
not live there.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.881
Not like Zemo did.

20:50.883 --> 20:53.050
Thank you both
for coming after me.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.620
I've always had friends
I could count on.

20:55.622 --> 20:57.788
It's nice to know I still do.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.690
You always will.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.626
Although as a friend,
I gotta tell you,

21:01.628 --> 21:05.062
this room would look
a lot better with a couple
of touch screens.

21:05.064 --> 21:06.964
Maybe a TV in the corner?

21:06.966 --> 21:09.433
I like things quiet in here.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.035
White noise generator.

21:11.037 --> 21:14.071
I know you can
hear Hulk's snoring.
We all can.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.906
You're one to talk.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.908
You know, we can hear you
during your naps,

21:17.910 --> 21:19.910
complimenting yourself
in your sleep.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.912
Okay, okay.
Hear me out.

21:21.914 --> 21:24.649
What about
an ice-cream machine?

21:24.651 --> 21:28.052
I know butter pecan
is your favorite.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.621
[Captain America]
Isn't it everybody's?
