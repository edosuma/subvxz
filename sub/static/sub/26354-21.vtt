00:21.609 --> 00:23.561
All bow to Gene-eesi,

00:23.586 --> 00:25.257
Toilet King of the House Belcher.

00:25.282 --> 00:27.304
First of his name, Pincher of Loafs.

00:27.329 --> 00:29.601
- Gene, please get off.
- Oh, boo.

00:29.626 --> 00:31.336
Wow, this is a lot of toilet paper.

00:31.361 --> 00:34.029
- Did we maybe get too much?
- No matter how much we order,

00:34.054 --> 00:36.160
- we always seem to run out.
- Yeah, it's almost like people

00:36.185 --> 00:38.021
are just flushing this
stuff down the toilet.

00:38.076 --> 00:39.746
Teddy, how's it going
with the dishwasher?

00:39.771 --> 00:41.861
- Not great, Bob!
- He's fine.

00:41.886 --> 00:43.612
Well, you guys are gonna
have to finish unpacking this

00:43.637 --> 00:45.977
without me, 'cause I got
to get to my PTA meeting.

00:46.002 --> 00:48.271
Got some great ideas. I think
Joanne is gonna love 'em!

00:48.296 --> 00:50.336
- Who's Joanne?
- The PTA president.

00:50.361 --> 00:52.590
And the person I want
to be when I grow up.

00:52.615 --> 00:54.956
I thought you wanted to be
Janet Jackson when you grow up.

00:54.981 --> 00:56.151
We both do.

00:56.176 --> 00:57.576
Last month, one of the other parents

00:57.601 --> 00:59.801
came up with an after-school
tutoring program.

00:59.826 --> 01:01.306
She called it "Real Punks Don't Flunk."

01:01.331 --> 01:03.541
Joanne took her out to
breakfast to talk it over,

01:03.566 --> 01:05.857
and the next thing you know,
all the punks are getting A's.

01:05.882 --> 01:08.863
Ugh. If I could just go to
one breakfast with Joanne.

01:08.888 --> 01:10.026
Can you imagine?

01:10.051 --> 01:12.131
Let me try. Oh, yeah, that's nice.

01:12.156 --> 01:14.566
Eh, too bad it's all
about to go down the tubes

01:14.591 --> 01:16.971
'cause of Colleen Caviello.

01:16.996 --> 01:19.246
She's running for treasurer
because Ray Mendoza

01:19.271 --> 01:21.446
bought a houseboat, and he's
gonna boat-school his kids.

01:21.471 --> 01:23.776
Aw! I really don't want
Colleen on the board.

01:23.801 --> 01:25.904
She's gonna take all the
fun out of fun-raising.

01:25.936 --> 01:28.980
You know it's "fund-raising,"
right, Lin? Not "fun-raising."

01:29.005 --> 01:30.771
Yeah...

01:30.796 --> 01:33.151
everybody knows that.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.386
Anyway, I'll see you later, crocodiles.

01:37.247 --> 01:38.926
Don't use the dishwasher yet, Bob.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.016
Still fixing it.

01:40.041 --> 01:41.751
Counterpoint. You fixed it.

01:41.776 --> 01:43.241
I'm gonna run to the hardware store.

01:43.266 --> 01:44.686
Ugh. How long is it gonna take?

01:44.711 --> 01:46.397
We really need that
dishwasher to be working.

01:46.422 --> 01:48.922
We wash dishes here? I've
just been putting them outside.

01:48.947 --> 01:50.501
- What?
- It's right down the street.

01:50.526 --> 01:52.606
Kim & Son's Hardware? Family business?

01:52.631 --> 01:54.461
They give me the
"contractor's discount."

01:54.551 --> 01:56.761
Huh. I usually just go to Fix-It Depot.

01:56.786 --> 01:58.146
Fix-It Depot? That's fine...

01:58.171 --> 01:59.761
If you want to crush the little guy.

01:59.786 --> 02:01.456
I am not crushing anyone, Teddy.

02:01.481 --> 02:03.111
They just have everything there.

02:03.136 --> 02:06.271
Like vices you can use to crush
the heart of a family business?

02:06.296 --> 02:08.660
Teddy, you know we're a family business.

02:08.685 --> 02:11.006
Are you? Then why don't you
act like a family business

02:11.086 --> 02:13.191
- for once in your life!
- Yeah!

02:13.216 --> 02:14.496
Hey, why don't you come with me?

02:14.546 --> 02:16.136
We'll be back in, like, ten minutes.

02:16.161 --> 02:17.307
Kids, you want to take a little break

02:17.346 --> 02:18.906
and go to the hardware store with Teddy?

02:18.931 --> 02:20.601
He seems like he's... doing well.

02:20.626 --> 02:22.701
Sure. Kids love hardware stores.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.516
Can we go to the laundromat, too?

02:24.541 --> 02:25.871
Yay. Errands.

02:27.131 --> 02:28.261
All in favor?

02:28.413 --> 02:29.923
All opposed?

02:30.106 --> 02:31.606
Looks like cookies beat out brownies

02:31.631 --> 02:33.171
as the snack at our next meeting!

02:33.196 --> 02:35.066
Congrats, Beth. We know how passionate

02:35.091 --> 02:36.591
you are about those cookies.

02:36.616 --> 02:37.946
Look at Joanne go.

02:37.971 --> 02:39.891
I know. She's amazing.

02:39.916 --> 02:42.051
Okay. As you all read in my e-mail,

02:42.076 --> 02:44.366
we have a fund-raiser coming up

02:44.391 --> 02:47.521
for seventh grade science kits!

02:47.546 --> 02:48.676
Spirit fingers!

02:48.706 --> 02:50.206
Aw. I love spirit fingers.

02:50.296 --> 02:54.006
It's like typing a quiet
message that says, "Yay!"

02:54.086 --> 02:55.586
Now, we don't have a theme yet,

02:55.676 --> 02:58.006
so I hope you all came
with some fun ideas.

02:58.031 --> 02:59.281
Oh! Ooh! Ooh!

02:59.306 --> 03:01.346
Linda. Yeah, let's hear it, girl.

03:01.371 --> 03:04.896
Um, my idea for the
theme is "Surfin' PTA."

03:04.921 --> 03:07.106
- Ooh!
- Get a surf deejay.

03:07.186 --> 03:08.816
Someone could dress up like a shark

03:08.856 --> 03:10.919
- and serve Shark-donnay.
- Stop it.

03:10.944 --> 03:12.857
And we could even cover
the floor with sand.

03:12.882 --> 03:14.148
You know, 'cause sand's at the beach.

03:14.173 --> 03:15.963
- Yeah!
- Can I say something?

03:15.988 --> 03:17.634
I wasn't finished, Colleen.

03:17.659 --> 03:19.879
Uh, anyway, spirit
fingers. Okay, I'm done.

03:20.022 --> 03:22.902
For those of you who don't know
me, hi, I'm Colleen Caviello.

03:22.927 --> 03:25.677
I'm running for PTA treasurer.
And I just want to say,

03:25.702 --> 03:28.277
I don't think that Linda has
thought through how expensive

03:28.302 --> 03:30.311
- her idea would be.
- Huh!

03:30.336 --> 03:33.636
All that stuff she wants
would put us at... $45 a head,

03:33.661 --> 03:36.176
- 200 people... that's...
- A hundred fifty...

03:36.201 --> 03:38.201
- $9,000.
- $9,000.

03:38.361 --> 03:40.683
So maybe let's keep
brainstorming, I don't know.

03:40.708 --> 03:43.526
Hey, you know what, I got a
spirit finger for you, Colleen.

03:43.551 --> 03:45.931
Okay, that's not how
we use spirit fingers.

03:46.016 --> 03:48.857
Let's circle back to the
fund-raiser in our next meeting.

03:48.882 --> 03:51.716
Moving along on the
agenda, let's talk about...

03:51.741 --> 03:54.604
replacing the dead shrubbery
in front of the school.

03:54.629 --> 03:57.129
Or maybe just painting it green.

03:58.708 --> 04:00.166
Ooh. There's Danny.

04:00.276 --> 04:01.462
He's the owner's son.

04:01.486 --> 04:02.794
- Hi, Danny!
- Hey, Todd.

04:02.819 --> 04:05.231
That's Danny. He calls
me Todd sometimes.

04:05.256 --> 04:06.891
Dad, can we go explore,

04:06.916 --> 04:09.286
away from this slightly
sad conversation?

04:09.311 --> 04:11.351
- Fine.
- It's hammer time!

04:11.431 --> 04:13.456
Hey, Mr. Kim! This is my friend Bob.

04:13.481 --> 04:15.894
- Bob, Mr. Kim.
- Uh, hello. Hi.

04:15.919 --> 04:18.016
Bob's never been to a
hardware store before.

04:18.046 --> 04:20.005
- First time.
- I-I actually, I have been...

04:20.031 --> 04:21.991
I have...

04:22.016 --> 04:23.901
He doesn't know what
any of this stuff is.

04:23.926 --> 04:25.226
I-I know what it all is, Teddy.

04:25.251 --> 04:27.211
Anyway, we're looking for an inlet valve

04:27.236 --> 04:29.536
- for a dishwasher.
- That's, uh, aisle one.

04:29.561 --> 04:30.982
Great. I'll go get it.

04:32.171 --> 04:34.211
It's a nice place you have here.

04:34.439 --> 04:36.122
All the aisles.

04:36.606 --> 04:39.751
Uh, what happened? Did your,
uh, did your bird fly away?

04:44.501 --> 04:45.881
- Oh, no.
- Hey.

04:45.906 --> 04:47.536
He looked upset. What'd you say?

04:47.576 --> 04:49.816
Teddy, please don't tell
me his bird just flew away.

04:49.841 --> 04:51.931
- His bird just flew away.
- Are you serious?

04:51.956 --> 04:54.126
I just made a joke about
his bird flying away.

04:54.151 --> 04:56.911
That's not a good joke, Bob.
Mr. Kim loved that parrot.

04:57.046 --> 04:58.861
Oh, my God, I feel horrible.

04:58.886 --> 05:01.919
Dad, can we get this? It
makes underwater fart sounds.

05:01.944 --> 05:03.776
Gene.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.241
See?

05:05.266 --> 05:07.226
- You okay, Dad?
- Uh, I think I just broke

05:07.251 --> 05:08.921
an old man's heart.

05:08.946 --> 05:11.951
- Is the old man you?
- No. Another old man, Tina.

05:11.976 --> 05:13.316
Way to go, Bob!

05:13.341 --> 05:15.541
Well, let's just go home, I guess.

05:15.566 --> 05:17.186
Wait. What about the pipe?

05:17.276 --> 05:19.736
You can get it, but this
counts for everyone's birthday.

05:19.776 --> 05:20.776
- Yes!
- That's fair.

05:20.801 --> 05:22.171
We own this now!

05:27.863 --> 05:30.026
Hi, Lin. Uh, is everything okay?

05:30.051 --> 05:31.551
Oh, everything's fine.

05:31.576 --> 05:33.931
Colleen Caviello was as Colleen as ever.

05:33.956 --> 05:36.206
In fact, they should call
her Colleen Cavi-hell-no.

05:36.231 --> 05:38.231
Pretty cool name, to be honest.

05:38.376 --> 05:39.836
Bob's Burgers. We're a restaurant.

05:39.926 --> 05:41.176
- Tina.
- Yeah, she's here.

05:41.256 --> 05:43.111
- Mom, it's for you. It's Joanne.
- Really?

05:43.136 --> 05:44.972
Bob, how do I look? Do I look okay?

05:44.997 --> 05:47.532
-You look, uh, great.
-Shush, shush, shush. I'm on the phone.

05:47.556 --> 05:48.855
Hel... Hello?

05:48.880 --> 05:50.702
Hi, Linda. I hope I'm not catching you

05:50.727 --> 05:51.925
at a bad time.

05:51.950 --> 05:54.896
No, I-I was just, uh, organizing...

05:54.921 --> 05:57.461
uh, my, uh, stool... samples.

05:57.486 --> 05:59.746
- Hmm.
- Uh, and... I'm done.

05:59.771 --> 06:01.566
Well, I was calling to let you know that

06:01.591 --> 06:04.769
-I loved all your fun ideas today.
-You did?

06:04.785 --> 06:07.090
Why don't you and I have
breakfast tomorrow and talk?

06:07.115 --> 06:08.655
Breakfast?

06:08.680 --> 06:10.970
Uh, yeah, I'm free. Free as a tree!

06:10.995 --> 06:13.745
Great! Let's say 10:00
a.m. at the Muffin Top?

06:13.770 --> 06:15.671
Yeah, I'll see you then.

06:15.696 --> 06:18.722
PTA, get ready
for Me-T-A!

06:21.855 --> 06:24.394
Thanks for having
breakfast with me, Linda.

06:24.419 --> 06:26.860
Of course! Ah, I've been
wanting to get more involved.

06:26.885 --> 06:30.225
-Oh, and I love your PTA pendant!
-Oh, thank you.

06:30.250 --> 06:32.260
You can't spell "pendant" without PTA!

06:32.285 --> 06:33.314
Right?

06:33.339 --> 06:34.540
You're so fun, Linda.

06:34.565 --> 06:37.393
- I was telling Bear about you.
- Who's Bear?

06:37.418 --> 06:38.958
Oh, that's my husband, Barry.

06:38.983 --> 06:40.983
I call him Bear, and he calls me Jo-Jo.

06:41.008 --> 06:43.168
Aw. I call my husband
Bob-itty Bob-itty Bob-itty.

06:43.193 --> 06:45.193
In my head. Whenever he walks by.

06:45.218 --> 06:48.088
Anyway, I was telling him that
we need to find better ways

06:48.113 --> 06:49.458
to use you in the PTA.

06:49.483 --> 06:51.323
Have you ever considered
joining the board?

06:51.348 --> 06:53.968
I mean, I'd love to,
but with Colleen running

06:53.993 --> 06:56.913
to be the new treasurer, I'd
rather just sit this one out.

06:56.938 --> 06:58.123
Colleen.

06:58.148 --> 07:00.148
I mean, she is the only person running,

07:00.173 --> 07:02.383
and yeah, she has an
accounting background,

07:02.408 --> 07:03.683
but that's not everything.

07:03.708 --> 07:05.948
I think someone like you
would be a better fit.

07:06.038 --> 07:07.688
Me? No...

07:07.713 --> 07:09.633
Yeah! Who needs numbers?

07:09.658 --> 07:11.408
You're the expert in fun-bers.

07:11.433 --> 07:14.683
Well, I feel flattered,
plus happy divided by gassy.

07:14.708 --> 07:16.588
Ah, why'd I get the bran muffin?

07:16.613 --> 07:19.128
But me? Treasurer? I dunno.

07:19.153 --> 07:21.153
- Here, let me get this.
- Oh, no, no, Linda.

07:21.178 --> 07:24.808
This is paid for by the
official PTA credit card.

07:24.833 --> 07:26.248
Oh, wow.

07:26.273 --> 07:28.113
Thank you, Joanne.

07:28.138 --> 07:30.138
You know, for the rest of
the day, I'm going around

07:30.163 --> 07:32.663
to local businesses collecting
items for the auction.

07:32.688 --> 07:34.018
You're welcome to join me.

07:34.043 --> 07:35.993
I'm in. Ah, let me call my husband

07:36.018 --> 07:37.917
and let him know he's gotta
flip his own meat today.

07:39.068 --> 07:40.398
Okay, I get it.

07:40.423 --> 07:41.673
You like Joanne more than us.

07:41.698 --> 07:43.488
It's fine. Uh, bye.

07:43.513 --> 07:45.353
- Ready, Gene?
- Of course I'm ready.

07:45.378 --> 07:47.803
This is the most important
moment of my life.

07:47.828 --> 07:49.553
Okay. Pouring the ketchup now.

07:49.578 --> 07:50.788
Ah...

07:50.813 --> 07:52.443
Give it about... an hour.

07:52.618 --> 07:54.118
- Hi, Teddy.
- Hi, Bob.

07:54.168 --> 07:55.554
Just got back from the hardware store.

07:55.578 --> 07:57.088
Did you send Mr. Kim flowers?

07:57.263 --> 07:58.603
Yeah, I did.

07:58.628 --> 08:00.604
- Why would you do that?
- Wait, w-what do you mean?

08:00.628 --> 08:02.668
You sent a bouquet of Birds of Paradise

08:02.758 --> 08:04.178
to a guy who just lost his bird?

08:04.258 --> 08:06.088
Is that some kind of sick prank?

08:06.113 --> 08:07.783
That's what they sent? I just told them

08:07.808 --> 08:09.194
to pick out the most expensive flowers

08:09.219 --> 08:10.469
from their cheap section.

08:10.558 --> 08:12.153
Guess what? 'Cause of your bird flowers

08:12.178 --> 08:14.098
I lost my contractor's discount.

08:14.123 --> 08:16.373
I just paid full price
for this sandpaper.

08:16.398 --> 08:18.648
Thanks a lot, Bob. You owe me $1.20.

08:18.673 --> 08:20.093
What are you gonna do now, Dad?

08:20.118 --> 08:22.378
Uh... nothing. I'm gonna do nothing.

08:22.403 --> 08:24.713
So, what? That's it?
We're just never going back

08:24.738 --> 08:26.488
to Kim and Son's Hardware ever again?

08:26.513 --> 08:28.253
There are aisles and aisles of pipes

08:28.278 --> 08:30.828
that we will never play
with because of you.

08:30.853 --> 08:32.193
You can fix this, Dad.

08:32.217 --> 08:34.342
Do you wanna spend the
rest of your life knowing

08:34.368 --> 08:36.878
that sweet old Mr. Kim
thinks you're a monster?

08:36.903 --> 08:38.893
- Not really.
- I didn't think you were

08:38.918 --> 08:41.087
a monster until I saw you
eating yogurt that one time.

08:41.113 --> 08:43.823
Make Mr. Kim Not Hate Bob."

08:43.847 --> 08:45.468
-Who's in?
- I am. - Me, too.

08:45.718 --> 08:46.968
All right, fine.

08:46.993 --> 08:48.418
-Yay!
-Yes. -Nice.

08:48.443 --> 08:50.558
But let's please, just not do anything

08:50.583 --> 08:52.043
to make him more upset.

08:52.138 --> 08:54.978
Dad, do we look like people
who make bad decisions?

08:55.003 --> 08:58.623
The ketchup is arriving!

08:58.648 --> 08:59.848
Hey, Joanne.

08:59.898 --> 09:00.938
I have the basket

09:00.963 --> 09:02.189
for your fundraiser ready to go.

09:02.278 --> 09:04.238
Oh. Four bottles?

09:04.278 --> 09:05.988
Is that what we agreed on?

09:06.108 --> 09:07.528
Well, at first we said two,

09:07.658 --> 09:09.698
but then you talked me
up to four, remember?

09:09.723 --> 09:11.708
Here's the thing, I wouldn't ask

09:11.733 --> 09:13.643
for these bottles if this was about me.

09:13.668 --> 09:15.473
But this is about the children.

09:15.498 --> 09:17.288
This is about science.

09:17.313 --> 09:19.563
This is about those
three special letters

09:19.588 --> 09:21.598
that make the world a better place.

09:21.623 --> 09:24.333
- S-E-X?
- No, Linda. PTA.

09:24.358 --> 09:26.313
- Oh, right.
- So...

09:26.338 --> 09:27.678
Give what you can.

09:27.758 --> 09:29.678
Dammit, Joanne and other lady.

09:29.758 --> 09:31.098
I'll-I'll give you eight bottles.

09:31.123 --> 09:33.123
- Oh, great.
- And I'll throw in this magnet

09:33.148 --> 09:35.568
that says "Wine Time." For the kids.

09:35.593 --> 09:37.113

Okay, Dad, we finished the
flyer to find Mr. Kim's bird.

10:10.703 --> 10:13.153
I-I-It's good. My
only question is,

10:13.178 --> 10:15.288
why did you draw the
bird with a top hat?

10:15.313 --> 10:17.153
Because he's a bird.

10:17.178 --> 10:19.953
And talk to me about the roller
skates, and the fart cloud?

10:19.978 --> 10:21.398
It propels him forward.

10:21.423 --> 10:23.993
Okay, you've never made
a flyer, have you, Dad?

10:24.018 --> 10:25.898
Huh. Let's take another crack at this.

10:25.988 --> 10:28.038
We need something less... like this.

10:28.148 --> 10:30.028
Bigger fart cloud. Got it.

10:30.108 --> 10:31.408
So...

10:31.488 --> 10:32.988
big night tonight.

10:33.118 --> 10:35.593
First, I'm happy to report
that Linda and I scored

10:35.618 --> 10:37.538
a ton of auction items.

10:37.563 --> 10:39.933
- Spirit fingers.
- All right.

10:40.013 --> 10:42.013
Now that we have all this fun stuff,

10:42.038 --> 10:44.038
let's decide what the darn theme is.

10:44.063 --> 10:46.483
We have three top contenders...

10:46.508 --> 10:47.768
- Surfin' PTA,
- Mm.

10:47.838 --> 10:48.918
Under The Big Top,

10:48.943 --> 10:50.693
and Garfield versus Snoopy.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.458
I, for one, will be voting

10:52.483 --> 10:55.573
for Linda's amazing Surfin' PTA idea.

10:55.598 --> 10:59.098
All in favor of Surfin'
PTA, raise your hands.

10:59.138 --> 11:02.218
Well, I guess there's
no reason to hold a vote

11:02.243 --> 11:04.478
for the other two. We have a winner!

11:04.503 --> 11:06.583
Let's go surfin', baby!

11:06.608 --> 11:09.438
Hold on. As future treasurer,
I have to put my foot down.

11:09.463 --> 11:10.503
We can't afford this.

11:10.528 --> 11:11.908
Actually, that brings us

11:11.933 --> 11:14.463
to our next vote, PTA treasurer.

11:14.488 --> 11:15.988
Okay, let's get this over with.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.303
We have two candidates on the ballot.

11:18.328 --> 11:19.948
Two? I'm "unopposed."

11:19.973 --> 11:21.513
All of a sudden I'm "opposed"?

11:21.708 --> 11:23.708
- Who's the opposer?
- Linda Belcher.

11:23.748 --> 11:25.918
- Linda? What?
- Wait. What? I am?

11:26.048 --> 11:28.098
Linda told me over
breakfast the other day

11:28.128 --> 11:29.918
that she'd like to be more involved.

11:29.943 --> 11:31.693
That's... true.

11:31.718 --> 11:33.258
Everyone voting for Linda Belcher,

11:33.283 --> 11:35.323
raise your hand.

11:35.453 --> 11:37.033
She's got my vote.

11:37.058 --> 11:39.808
Okay. Now everyone voting

11:39.848 --> 11:42.303
for Colleen Caviello, raise your hand.

11:42.688 --> 11:45.833
It looks like Linda Belcher
is our new PTA treasurer.

11:46.170 --> 11:47.873
You just voted like really dumb people,

11:47.898 --> 11:49.608
and that's all I'm saying.

11:49.633 --> 11:51.543
And you're gonna regret this
for the rest of your lives.

11:51.568 --> 11:52.988
That's all I'm saying!

11:53.013 --> 11:54.963
Linda, you're on the board.

11:54.988 --> 11:56.924
- You're in the big show.
- Oh, my God, I'm on the board.

11:56.948 --> 11:59.408
Thank you, Beth. Wait,
don't-don't eat those.

11:59.433 --> 12:02.433
Joanne, hey. Hi.

12:02.458 --> 12:04.368
- Hey, there, new treasurer.
- Aw.

12:04.393 --> 12:06.393
I just wanted to say
thanks for supporting me.

12:06.473 --> 12:07.933
You're gonna be great.

12:07.958 --> 12:09.234
Hey, are those the bottles of wine

12:09.258 --> 12:10.848
that were donated for the auction?

12:10.873 --> 12:12.143
You need me to help you bring those in?

12:12.168 --> 12:14.378
Oh. No. I'm taking those home.

12:14.403 --> 12:16.113
Those are... really... old.

12:16.138 --> 12:19.178
Are those gift cards and
candles for the auction, too?

12:19.268 --> 12:21.528
Oh, yeah. They got dirt on them.

12:21.598 --> 12:23.558
And also, that candle smells bad.

12:23.583 --> 12:25.323
Hey, do you want a bottle of wine?

12:25.348 --> 12:27.122
And a bad-smelling candle?

12:27.147 --> 12:28.333
- Here you go.
- Oh.

12:28.358 --> 12:29.954
- You're on the board, now.
- Oh, uh, uh, no.

12:29.978 --> 12:31.464
- We're gonna make a great team.
- Uh... uh...

12:31.488 --> 12:32.698
Bye!

12:32.818 --> 12:34.028
Oh, boy.

12:34.148 --> 12:36.068
Mmm. What smells like
rosemary mint melon?

12:36.158 --> 12:39.069
N-Nothing. Bye!

12:42.264 --> 12:44.788
Ah, you know, I'm so glad
you were able to come by

12:44.828 --> 12:47.341
the restaurant today to
work on PTA stuff, Joanne.

12:47.366 --> 12:49.933
Me, too. I know you've only
been treasurer for one day,

12:49.958 --> 12:52.208
but I think you might
be the best treasurer

12:52.233 --> 12:55.161
in the history of the school,
maybe even the country.

12:55.186 --> 12:56.733
Thank you, Joanne.

12:56.758 --> 12:59.678
- Also, did you lose weight?
- In a day? Maybe.

12:59.703 --> 13:02.783
Anyway, I thought maybe you'd
like to sign this contract.

13:02.808 --> 13:04.058
Contract? Sure.

13:04.178 --> 13:05.558
Oh, wait, I don't have a pen.

13:05.583 --> 13:07.938
- Oh, just use your blood.
- Huh?

13:11.028 --> 13:13.158
Oh, your face!

13:13.188 --> 13:14.488
Oh, my face!

13:14.513 --> 13:17.333
Bob, wake up. I need to talk to you.

13:17.358 --> 13:19.155
Huh? Wha... What? What's going on?

13:19.180 --> 13:21.013
Bob, I don't feel good about Joanne

13:21.038 --> 13:22.298
taking that donation wine.

13:22.323 --> 13:23.703
And then giving me the wine,

13:23.743 --> 13:25.118
which I didn't drink, by the way.

13:25.143 --> 13:26.893
Was I not supposed to drink that?

13:26.918 --> 13:28.218
I gotta talk to her tomorrow.

13:28.288 --> 13:29.918
I gotta let her know how I feel.

13:29.958 --> 13:31.288
Yeah. I-I know what you mean.

13:31.338 --> 13:32.774
It's like this whole bird
thing with Mr. Kim and...

13:32.799 --> 13:35.148
Oh.

13:36.046 --> 13:37.418
So, Joanne,

13:37.443 --> 13:40.113
uh, listen, the reason I wanted
to talk to you is that I...

13:40.138 --> 13:43.718
Oh, before I forget, I have a
little surprise for you, Linda.

13:43.743 --> 13:46.613
It's your very own PTA pendant.

13:46.638 --> 13:48.128
It's gorgeous.

13:48.153 --> 13:49.783
So shiny.

13:49.808 --> 13:51.968
What was it that you wanted
to talk to me about, Linda?

13:52.018 --> 13:54.438
Well, I just wanted to say

13:54.463 --> 13:57.043
I'm not so sure PTA members

13:57.068 --> 14:00.249
should be taking donated
stuff for themselves.

14:01.738 --> 14:03.484
So, uh...

14:03.948 --> 14:07.118
Anyway... muffins.

14:10.168 --> 14:12.288
You are absolutely right.

14:12.313 --> 14:14.773
I am so glad you understand.

14:14.798 --> 14:16.088
It-It's just, you know,

14:16.113 --> 14:18.063
I put a lot of time into the PTA.

14:18.088 --> 14:20.548
I mean, it's almost a full-time job,

14:20.573 --> 14:23.073
except that it's not,
because I don't get paid.

14:23.098 --> 14:25.968
And sometimes, I guess
in a moment of weakness,

14:25.993 --> 14:27.613
I might, you know, order a muffin

14:27.638 --> 14:28.938
on the PTA credit card.

14:28.963 --> 14:32.333
I guess I-I feel like I deserve it.

14:32.358 --> 14:33.804
Aw.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.703
Oh, don't cry, Joanne.

14:35.728 --> 14:37.778
I'm sorry I said anything.

14:37.873 --> 14:39.833
Hey, one muffin ain't nuffin'.

14:39.858 --> 14:42.778
But it is, Linda. One muffin is suffin'.

14:42.933 --> 14:45.093
Do you think I'm a bad person, Lin-Lin?

14:45.118 --> 14:46.948
No. No, Jo-Jo.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.585
Are you kidding me?

14:48.610 --> 14:50.958
Should we split it, or...

14:50.983 --> 14:54.893
I mean, we don't want
to use this, right?

14:54.918 --> 14:57.758
You know what? Let's
put it on the PTA card.

14:57.783 --> 15:00.483
- We earned it.
- If you say so.

15:00.508 --> 15:03.048
By the way, here are the
invoices for everything.

15:03.073 --> 15:05.783
I need my new treasurer to
approve all the purchases

15:05.808 --> 15:07.154
and enter them into the spreadsheets.

15:07.178 --> 15:09.888
- You think you could do that?
- Yeah, sure.

15:09.913 --> 15:12.187
I'll, uh, start spreading the sheets.

15:13.253 --> 15:15.333
Uh, hey. I'm the guy who called

15:15.358 --> 15:16.857
about the missing bird on the flyer.

15:16.882 --> 15:19.068
Uh, right. Great. Is
it, uh, in that box?

15:19.148 --> 15:20.448
Yeah, well, well, hold on.

15:20.488 --> 15:22.068
Is this a reward situation or what?

15:22.183 --> 15:23.503
- I don't know.
- Name your price.

15:23.528 --> 15:24.948
- Gene.
- $10,000.

15:24.973 --> 15:26.963
Gene, stop. Uh, what's your price?

15:26.988 --> 15:28.738
- $10,000?
- No.

15:28.828 --> 15:30.078
- $15,000.
- Stop.

15:30.118 --> 15:31.118
Do I hear 20?

15:31.208 --> 15:33.078
Look, I'll-I'll give you ten bucks.

15:33.103 --> 15:34.813
And we'll throw in this formerly fun

15:34.838 --> 15:36.748
but now super nasty pipe.

15:36.798 --> 15:38.928
It comes with one hot dog
that's already stuck inside.

15:39.008 --> 15:40.878
Eh, all right. I'll-I'll take it.

15:40.968 --> 15:42.338
Really? Uh, okay.

15:42.428 --> 15:43.888
So, let's see the bird.

15:43.968 --> 15:47.008
This isn't a parrot. This is a pigeon.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.073
No, it's not. It's,
uh, it's just scared,

15:49.098 --> 15:51.074
- so it's acting like a pigeon.
- I do that sometimes.

15:51.098 --> 15:53.138
No. You know what, I-I'm
not paying for this.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.163
Are you accusing me of catching a pigeon

15:55.188 --> 15:56.978
and trying to sell it for ten bucks?

15:57.018 --> 15:58.398
- Yes.
- Well, I'm leaving.

15:58.423 --> 16:00.578
And I'm taking the bird
with me. And this pipe.

16:00.648 --> 16:02.108
That's fine.

16:02.198 --> 16:03.238
Huh.

16:03.318 --> 16:05.778
These science kits cost $40 each?

16:05.818 --> 16:07.518
Let me see how much these
things cost on the website.

16:07.543 --> 16:09.883
Science Wow Products.

16:09.908 --> 16:11.908
Oh, Joanne's buying them retail.

16:11.933 --> 16:13.159
That's why they're so expensive.

16:13.184 --> 16:15.054
Why would she do that?

16:15.079 --> 16:18.723
"Science Wow is a division
of Jo-Jo Bear Publishing."

16:18.748 --> 16:21.298
Wait a minute. Jo-Jo Bear...

16:21.323 --> 16:23.873
I call him Bear, and he calls me Jo-Jo.

16:23.898 --> 16:25.888
Oh, my goodness! Joanne and her husband

16:25.913 --> 16:28.153
own the company that
makes the science kits.

16:28.178 --> 16:32.258
This is bad. This is Jo-Jo Beary bad.

16:36.308 --> 16:37.978
So, this is what it looks like

16:38.003 --> 16:40.253
when someone listens
to one of Mom's ideas.

16:40.278 --> 16:41.618
So many dad sandals.

16:41.753 --> 16:43.213
So many milky white ankles.

16:43.238 --> 16:46.158
There she is. The Big
Little Liar herself.

16:46.183 --> 16:48.003
Lin, are you sure you
still want to do this?

16:48.028 --> 16:50.158
I don't want to do this, Bob. I have to.

16:50.183 --> 16:52.328
I tried calling her,
but she never picked up.

16:52.353 --> 16:54.433
Then I called the National PTA hotline,

16:54.458 --> 16:56.603
and the only options were
press one for car washes

16:56.628 --> 16:59.748
and press two for bake sales.
So now we're down to this.

16:59.773 --> 17:01.483
The Bleach Boys, everybody.

17:01.508 --> 17:03.078
The Bleach Boys.

17:03.103 --> 17:05.563
Oh, I get it. 'Cause they're janitors.

17:05.588 --> 17:08.167
We have CD’s I can burn

17:08.193 --> 17:10.823
from my computer at home. E-mail me.

17:10.848 --> 17:13.218
Before we get to the
auction, some thank yous.

17:13.242 --> 17:15.363
There is one person in particular.

17:15.387 --> 17:16.848
Ladies and gentlemen,

17:16.873 --> 17:19.797
our new PTA treasurer, Linda Belcher.

17:20.333 --> 17:22.002
I know her. Linda, hi!

17:22.028 --> 17:23.657
And now on to the auction.

17:23.683 --> 17:27.463
Actually, uh, Joanne, if
I may just say a few words?

17:27.488 --> 17:28.648
Oh. Um, okay.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.383
I just wanted to say the reason

17:30.408 --> 17:32.188
I got more involved with the PTA

17:32.213 --> 17:34.389
was because I was so inspired by Joanne.

17:34.414 --> 17:35.763
Aw. Thank you, Linda.

17:35.795 --> 17:38.545
It's my pleasure, Jo-Jo.
Fun fact, everyone...

17:38.570 --> 17:40.763
Joanne's husband calls her Jo-Jo,

17:40.788 --> 17:42.418
and she calls him Bear.

17:42.443 --> 17:44.073
This is a really good speech.

17:44.098 --> 17:45.693
That's true.

17:45.718 --> 17:47.878
- Uh, okay. I... Can I...
- Okay. Give it back.

17:47.968 --> 17:50.218
- Just... Release.
- I got it.

17:50.258 --> 17:53.859
Okay. Well, let's get on
with the auction, shall we?

17:53.884 --> 17:56.638
-And they even have a company
called Jo-Jo Bear. -Okay.

17:56.663 --> 17:58.678
Spirit fingers. Spirit fingers.

17:58.703 --> 18:00.873
And what's even more interesting

18:00.898 --> 18:05.148
is that their company makes
the very expensive science kits

18:05.173 --> 18:06.973
that we're raising funds for tonight.

18:06.998 --> 18:08.148
Isn't that a coincidence?

18:08.238 --> 18:09.738
Linda, what are you doing?

18:09.763 --> 18:12.328
Yeah, yeah. She bought
all the science kits

18:12.353 --> 18:14.213
from her own company
at a crazy high price.

18:14.238 --> 18:16.278
That's not true. And even if it was,

18:16.303 --> 18:19.393
all the invoices were entered
and approved by the treasurer,

18:19.418 --> 18:21.013
- which is you.
- Right.

18:21.038 --> 18:22.838
Which I now see is what you wanted

18:22.863 --> 18:24.643
because you didn't think
I knew what I was doing.

18:24.668 --> 18:26.338
And yes, for a little while,

18:26.363 --> 18:28.193
I was entering commas
instead of decimals

18:28.218 --> 18:29.928
and lowercase Ls instead of 1's

18:29.953 --> 18:32.273
because they look the same,
but then I figured it out.

18:32.298 --> 18:34.718
And then I got someone to check my work.

18:34.743 --> 18:36.453
Colleen?

18:36.478 --> 18:38.148
Hello, Joanne.

18:38.173 --> 18:40.163
Wait. Why is she in the shark costume?

18:40.188 --> 18:42.018
Linda thought it would be more dramatic.

18:42.043 --> 18:43.583
She was right.

18:43.608 --> 18:45.778
This is ridiculous.
You have nothing on me.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.988
Oh, we have plenty on you, Joanne.

18:48.068 --> 18:49.948
Linda called me last night.

18:50.028 --> 18:51.658
- And you hung up on me.
- I did.

18:51.698 --> 18:52.964
But then you left that weird message,

18:52.988 --> 18:53.908
and I called you back.

18:53.988 --> 18:55.618
It wasn't weird. It was fine.

18:55.698 --> 18:57.054
Well, everyone in my
house listened to it,

18:57.078 --> 18:58.384
and we all thought it was very weird.

18:58.408 --> 18:59.958
Anyway, came over to my house...

18:59.998 --> 19:02.028
- Her slightly tacky house.
- How dare you?

19:02.053 --> 19:03.223
Oh, give me a break.

19:03.248 --> 19:05.128
And she showed me all the spreadsheets.

19:05.248 --> 19:06.918
I spent all night auditing

19:07.048 --> 19:09.118
every PTA expense over
the last two years,

19:09.143 --> 19:12.193
and it looks like someone's
been skimming off the top.

19:12.218 --> 19:15.508
Okay, sure. I might take
an occasional bottle of wine

19:15.533 --> 19:18.283
or an eyebrow threading
gift certificate.

19:18.308 --> 19:20.851
I mean, not that I need
it. I just wanted to try it.

19:20.876 --> 19:23.798
But let's be honest, who's
gonna plan an event like this?

19:23.823 --> 19:26.203
You, Colleen? You, Linda?

19:26.228 --> 19:27.638
You, Beth?

19:27.663 --> 19:29.543
Do you have any idea

19:29.568 --> 19:31.108
how many e-mails I send a week?

19:31.303 --> 19:34.093
No, you don't. Because
no one reads them.

19:34.118 --> 19:35.868
No one even clicks on them!

19:35.988 --> 19:37.408
I will not be questioned

19:37.448 --> 19:40.118
by people eating crab
cakes that I ordered

19:40.143 --> 19:42.183
on napkins I folded.

19:42.208 --> 19:43.958
I'm not in the PTA.

19:44.218 --> 19:47.223
I am the PTA!

19:47.248 --> 19:49.458
Did she say that there
were crab cakes here?

19:49.588 --> 19:52.288
All right, it's auction time!

19:52.313 --> 19:55.693
Our first item is a
basket of smelly soaps.

19:55.718 --> 19:57.453
No takers? No one?

19:57.478 --> 19:58.533
It's over, Joanne.

19:58.558 --> 20:00.783
- No! No!
- Give me the microphone.

20:00.808 --> 20:05.008
- No! I can't do it! Oh!
- Give it! Give it now. Give it!

20:05.033 --> 20:06.283
All those in favor

20:06.308 --> 20:08.593
of replacing Joanne as PTA president,

20:08.618 --> 20:10.123
raise your hand.

20:10.253 --> 20:11.463
Fine. I'll leave.

20:11.488 --> 20:13.463
Good luck cleaning up all this sand.

20:13.488 --> 20:15.294
Raise your hand if you're
sticking around after

20:15.318 --> 20:16.818
to clean up sand.

20:17.043 --> 20:18.713
Yeah, that's what I thought.

20:18.738 --> 20:19.868
I'm gonna miss her.

20:20.053 --> 20:21.659
One, two, three, four!

20:26.328 --> 20:27.998
This is gonna be great.

20:28.023 --> 20:30.143
There's nothing a free bird can't fix.

20:30.258 --> 20:31.938
That is what the song
"Free Bird" is about.

20:32.048 --> 20:34.048
- Bob, what are you doing here?
- Hey, Teddy.

20:34.088 --> 20:36.888
We're bringing Mr. Kim
a bird as a sorry gift.

20:36.968 --> 20:38.388
I'm also bringing him a bird.

20:38.428 --> 20:40.178
- What?
- I want to get my discount back.

20:40.203 --> 20:42.033
W-Well, I'm gonna give him

20:42.058 --> 20:43.848
- my bird first.
- Not if I beat you to it.

20:43.873 --> 20:46.373
No, no, no, no, no. No pushing, Teddy.

20:46.398 --> 20:48.018
Oh!

20:48.043 --> 20:50.250
Is that... Did he
already get a new bird?

20:50.275 --> 20:52.358
- Looks like it.
- You!

20:52.383 --> 20:54.423
- Leave the birds. Let's go.
- We got you birds!

20:54.448 --> 20:56.084
- Now you have three birds.
- You're welcome.

20:56.108 --> 20:57.525
We love your store.
