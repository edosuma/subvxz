00:45.125 --> 00:47.293
How could you do that?

00:47.327 --> 00:51.863
To me? To everyone who believes in you?

00:51.898 --> 00:54.800
There are no secrets from God.

00:54.834 --> 00:57.235
He knows everything! He sees everything!

00:57.269 --> 00:59.237
- Everything!
- Jeanette...

00:59.271 --> 01:01.172
- Read it for yourself.

01:01.207 --> 01:04.042
"Even also as I am known... "

01:04.077 --> 01:06.411
<i>There it is! Dans la Bible! Look!</i>

01:06.445 --> 01:08.413
<i>Jeanette, calme-toi.</i>

01:08.447 --> 01:10.748
You have to tell the truth.

01:10.782 --> 01:13.017
If you will not tell, then I will.

01:13.051 --> 01:15.019
<i>- Mon enfant... 
- I must tell the truth!</i>

01:15.053 --> 01:18.089
Shh, Jeanette! (Door opening and closing)

01:18.124 --> 01:20.191
(Jeanette panting)

01:26.297 --> 01:28.699
Lord...

01:28.734 --> 01:30.768
guide me.

01:30.802 --> 01:32.870
Show me what to do.

01:35.173 --> 01:37.741
Ugh!

01:40.278 --> 01:42.812
(Crabtree): I'm sorry,
sir. Your name again?

01:42.847 --> 01:44.981
- François Robichaud.
- And your position here

01:45.016 --> 01:47.317
- at the church?
- I dig the graves.

01:49.287 --> 01:51.355
You say you found her here this morning?

01:51.389 --> 01:53.690
<i>Oui, à... seven o'clock.</i>

01:53.724 --> 01:55.825
- Did you know her?
- She is the maid

01:55.860 --> 01:59.328
<i>at the presbytère here at Saint-Francis.</i>

01:59.363 --> 02:01.297
Jeanette Rajotte.

02:01.331 --> 02:03.867
Rajotte?

02:03.901 --> 02:06.169
And this is her parents' grave?

02:06.203 --> 02:09.505
<i>Oui. They died when she was a child.</i>

02:09.539 --> 02:11.507
<i>Choléra. Ouf!</i>

02:11.542 --> 02:14.377
Jeanette was raised by
the nuns of Sacré-Coeur.

02:14.411 --> 02:18.214
She would come here to pray.

02:18.248 --> 02:20.249
Monsieur Robichaud, I assume

02:20.284 --> 02:22.218
that you've used this spade before?

02:22.252 --> 02:26.522
<i>Mais oui. I had to bury
somebody... just yesterday.</i>

02:26.557 --> 02:28.557
We'll need a sample of your fingermarks.

02:28.591 --> 02:32.127
<i>- Who is the priest here?
- Le père Lebel.</i>

02:32.162 --> 02:35.564
A green stick but a good man.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.671
Excuse me. Detective William Murdoch.

02:42.706 --> 02:46.107
Toronto Constabulary. I'm
looking for Father Lebel.

02:46.141 --> 02:48.176
<i>Désolée. He is not here.</i>

02:48.211 --> 02:50.679
Do you know when he'll return?

02:50.713 --> 02:53.014
He was not in his room when
I brought him his breakfast.

02:53.048 --> 02:56.585
Maybe he went to visit a sick parishioner.

02:56.619 --> 02:59.821
<i>- Do you have any idea where?
- Non.</i>

02:59.855 --> 03:02.969
But I think he'll be back soon.
He has an important meeting.

03:02.970 --> 03:03.970
With whom?

03:04.093 --> 03:06.160
Someone from the office of the bishop.

03:06.195 --> 03:08.262
♪

03:19.073 --> 03:22.109
Father Keegan?

03:22.143 --> 03:25.312
Oh, my Lord.

03:25.347 --> 03:28.582
- William Murdoch.
- (Murdoch laughing)

03:28.617 --> 03:32.319
- It's been a long time.
- Yes. What are you doing here?

03:32.354 --> 03:35.255
I have a meeting with the
priest, Father Daniel Lebel.

03:35.289 --> 03:37.357
According to the housekeeper,

03:37.391 --> 03:39.359
he left sometime during the
night and hasn't returned.

03:39.393 --> 03:43.429
Strange. Hm, it seems we're
looking for the same man.

03:45.430 --> 03:47.052
What brings you to Toronto, Father?

03:47.225 --> 03:49.226
Some time ago, the
bishop appointed me to be

03:49.261 --> 03:52.162
a spiritual advisor. So now I
travel to the smaller dioceses,

03:52.296 --> 03:54.390
I advise the priests, I
hear their confessions.

03:54.391 --> 03:56.426
And why were you visiting Father Lebeb?

03:56.460 --> 03:58.328
Supposed to be a routine visit.

03:58.362 --> 04:00.896
- Apparently, it's anything but.
- Unfortunately.

04:02.766 --> 04:06.202
Jeanette Rajotte. She was
found dead this morning.

04:06.237 --> 04:07.460
- (Keegan speaking Latin)
- Dr. Grace.

04:07.461 --> 04:08.261
Detective Murdoch.

04:08.442 --> 04:11.677
- I would like you to meet Father Keegan.
- Hello, Father.

04:11.712 --> 04:15.915
We meet in less than pleasant
circumstances, I'm afraid.

04:15.949 --> 04:17.583
Severe blunt force trauma to the cranium.

04:17.618 --> 04:19.786
I'll do a thorough
post-mortem but it seems to be

04:19.820 --> 04:21.788
- what killed her.
- I've sent the likely

04:21.822 --> 04:24.723
murder weapon, a garden spade,
to Station House for analysis.

04:24.757 --> 04:26.725
The blow was delivered from above.

04:26.759 --> 04:29.028
- You're correct.
- Father Keegan

04:29.062 --> 04:31.863
- was the first of my teachers.
- Judging by the severity

04:31.898 --> 04:34.333
of the wound, I would
say death was immediate.

04:34.367 --> 04:36.768
A fair amount of blood spatter.

04:36.803 --> 04:39.138
The killer likely got some
on his clothing as well.

04:39.172 --> 04:41.506
Indeed.

04:41.541 --> 04:44.275
Given the rigor, she's been dead

04:44.310 --> 04:46.010
- for at least a few hours.
- Mm-hmm.

04:46.045 --> 04:48.647
Which means the culprit likely
had time to clean himself up.

04:48.681 --> 04:51.550
(Keegan): It was a single blow.
Not a frenzy. Calculated perhaps.

04:51.584 --> 04:53.718
The murder weapon came from nearby,

04:53.753 --> 04:56.287
- so possibly an impulse.
- No.

04:56.322 --> 04:59.257
Ahem! Perhaps I should
just let you two continue.

04:59.291 --> 05:01.392
Yes, terribly sorry, Doctor.

05:01.427 --> 05:03.794
- We'll await your report.
- You shall have it presently.

05:11.503 --> 05:15.038
- Oh! Madame Benoit.
- Detective.

05:15.073 --> 05:17.875
I wonder, did you hear or see

05:17.909 --> 05:20.778
anything out of the ordinary
in the presbytery last night?

05:20.812 --> 05:24.348
<i>Non. Well, I heard voices.</i>

05:24.382 --> 05:26.550
An argument. It woke my baby.

05:26.585 --> 05:29.353
- Whose voices?
- I don't know.

05:29.387 --> 05:31.955
- You didn't recognize them?
- (Baby cooing)

05:31.990 --> 05:34.891
- Maybe one was Jeanette.
- And the other

05:34.925 --> 05:36.893
possibly Father Lebel?

05:36.927 --> 05:39.329
I don't know. It was a man's voice.

05:39.364 --> 05:41.631
I see. And what time was this?

05:41.665 --> 05:43.633
Nine o'clock maybe.

05:43.667 --> 05:46.236
Thank you, Madame Benoit.

05:46.270 --> 05:48.170
Oh, and if you do see Father Lebel,

05:48.205 --> 05:50.172
please have him contact me immediately.

05:50.207 --> 05:51.204
<i>Bien sûr.</i>

05:51.205 --> 05:52.705
- Thank you.
- Father.

05:56.836 --> 06:00.439
- I should get back to the Station House.
- Of course. Of course.

06:00.474 --> 06:03.375
You must join my wife and
I for dinner this evening.

06:03.410 --> 06:06.011
A wife... splendid. That's just splendid.

06:06.045 --> 06:09.215
- Do you have children?
- Not as yet.

06:09.249 --> 06:11.250
You don't want to wait
very much longer, Will.

06:11.284 --> 06:13.885
A young child and an old
man is a tiring equation.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.222
Ha!

06:16.256 --> 06:18.824
When he was 12 years old,

06:18.858 --> 06:22.060
he took it upon himself
to construct a sort of...

06:22.095 --> 06:24.096
- What was it you were building?
- (Woman giggling)

06:24.130 --> 06:26.464
- Thank you.
- I was attempting to bend

06:26.499 --> 06:30.401
sunlight around a corner
using a series of lenses.

06:30.436 --> 06:32.403
(laughing): As all children are wont to do.

06:32.438 --> 06:36.307
Yes. His interests were,
shall we say, unusual.

06:36.342 --> 06:38.443
It was working.

06:38.477 --> 06:40.578
Unfortunately, the lenses served

06:40.613 --> 06:42.980
to intensify the sun's light.

06:43.015 --> 06:44.915
He ended up burning down my shed,

06:44.950 --> 06:47.485
- is what he's trying to say.
- (laughing): William.

06:47.520 --> 06:50.421
Well, as they say, "Children
learn through their mistakes."

06:50.456 --> 06:52.990
So I guess you learned a great deal.

06:53.025 --> 06:56.393
Yes, I did. But I rebuilt
the shed within the month.

06:56.427 --> 06:58.763
And you did a very fine job, as I recall.

06:58.797 --> 07:02.466
And he did it all by himself.
I offered to help, he refused.

07:02.500 --> 07:05.703
Stubborn and virtuous, even then.

07:05.737 --> 07:08.472
Young Will was no run-of-the-mill boy.

07:08.506 --> 07:11.975
He had an exceptionally
sharp and inquiring mind.

07:12.009 --> 07:15.111
In his youth, he was
very much a daydreamer.

07:15.146 --> 07:17.548
♪

07:21.919 --> 07:23.887
(Keegan clearing his throat)

07:26.991 --> 07:30.994
(Keegan speaking Latin)

07:31.028 --> 07:32.996
(whispering): Pay attention, Will.

07:33.030 --> 07:34.664
(whispering: Yes, Father.

07:39.136 --> 07:42.338
I am sorry we haven't kept in touch, Will.

07:42.372 --> 07:45.174
- I did write.
- Oh, I left Nova Scotia very soon after you.

07:45.209 --> 07:48.877
I went to various parishes
until the bishop decided I was...

07:48.912 --> 07:52.815
the diplomatic sort and I would
serve better as an advisor.

07:52.849 --> 07:54.817
Hmm.

07:54.851 --> 07:58.221
Why is it the bishop sent you
to speak with Father Lebel?

07:58.255 --> 08:00.388
It was a routine visit. Up until now,

08:00.423 --> 08:02.390
we've had nothing but
good reports about him.

08:02.425 --> 08:06.028
Well, I do hope I'm not about
to sully a fine reputation.

08:06.062 --> 08:09.464
But a young woman has been
murdered in his backyard,

08:09.498 --> 08:12.667
and he has disappeared.

08:12.702 --> 08:14.870
(indistinct chatter)

08:18.674 --> 08:21.175
Father Lebel has yet to
return to the presbytery, Will.

08:21.210 --> 08:23.177
- I'm becoming quite concerned.
- His disappearance likely

08:23.212 --> 08:25.747
has something to do with our
murder the question is what?

08:25.781 --> 08:28.750
- I hope you don't mind my coming along.
- You're more than welcome.

08:28.784 --> 08:30.752
- Sir.
- What have you, George?

08:30.786 --> 08:32.754
The lads have been through
Mademoiselle Rajotte's room

08:32.788 --> 08:34.756
- and found nothing amiss.
- And what of the sisters

08:34.789 --> 08:36.758
of the parish? Were they
able to shed some light?

08:36.792 --> 08:38.960
I'm afraid not, sir. They all describe her

08:38.994 --> 08:41.996
as a devout Catholic whose only
wish was to enter the convent.

08:42.030 --> 08:43.931
And what of her
relationship with the Father?

08:43.966 --> 08:46.033
They say she was truly devoted to him.

08:46.068 --> 08:48.035
It seems unlikely then
that the argument heard

08:48.070 --> 08:50.036
by Madame Benoit was
between the two of them.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.005
Well, then it appears we are still

08:52.039 --> 08:56.577
in search of a motive. Thank you, George.

08:56.611 --> 08:58.579
Edna, what brings you by?

08:58.613 --> 09:00.847
Well, as it happens, I need your help.

09:00.882 --> 09:03.584
Oh, you haven't been out on
another crime spree, have you?

09:03.618 --> 09:05.852
Well, never fear. The
constabulary has been known

09:05.887 --> 09:07.888
to look the other way
if circumstances warrant.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.890
Actually, I wanted your
opinion as a man of letters.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.557
Oh?

09:11.592 --> 09:14.661
Wickley's Bakery is having a contest.

09:14.695 --> 09:17.597
"Whoever can write the best
slogan extolling the virtues

09:17.631 --> 09:20.667
of Wickley's bread will
win free loaves for a year.

09:20.701 --> 09:22.802
And the writer's image
might be used on the poster."

09:22.836 --> 09:24.804
Edna, that would be marvelous.

09:24.838 --> 09:27.674
Well, it's a good-looking
loaf. Wonderfully soft.

09:27.708 --> 09:30.209
Yes. I tried my hand at it, but...

09:30.243 --> 09:32.378
- Well, let's have a look.
- I fear

09:32.413 --> 09:34.447
I don't have the same powers of imagination

09:34.481 --> 09:36.649
- that you do.
- Well, Edna, few do.

09:36.684 --> 09:38.717
But no writer should be
judged on their first effort.

09:38.751 --> 09:40.953
I mean, the first draft of
my novel was no great shakes.

09:40.987 --> 09:43.322
- Sure it's better than this.
- If that's true, it's only

09:43.356 --> 09:45.524
because ancient pharaohs
rising out of the grave

09:45.558 --> 09:48.760
is better subject material
than a loaf of bread.

09:48.795 --> 09:51.496
"Wickley's bread is free of germs

09:51.531 --> 09:53.833
because it has been bleached.

09:53.867 --> 09:57.035
And what could be cleaner than bleach."

09:57.069 --> 10:00.739
It's thought that germs are
the cause of most diseases.

10:00.773 --> 10:03.342
Yes, but, Edna, bleach tastes terrible.

10:03.376 --> 10:06.845
- Have you tried it?
- Well, only on... I had to...

10:06.879 --> 10:09.080
It doesn't matter. What
you want to say is that

10:09.114 --> 10:11.382
the bread is clean and healthy,

10:11.416 --> 10:14.285
not sodden in germs, but without
mentioning bleach, I think.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.322
You know, something... pithy. Something...

10:17.356 --> 10:19.423
Leave it with me, let
me think on it a while.

10:19.458 --> 10:22.193
OK. Thank you, George.

10:22.228 --> 10:24.262
Oh, thank you.

10:26.899 --> 10:28.833
(George sniffing) Mmm!

10:28.867 --> 10:32.603
There's marked lividity in
the anterior of the body.

10:32.637 --> 10:34.705
As rigor was quite advanced,

10:34.740 --> 10:37.375
I would put the time of death
at shortly after midnight.

10:37.409 --> 10:39.677
The lividity also shows that the body...

10:39.711 --> 10:41.645
The body wasn't moved after death.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.681
You're familiar with the process
of morbid development, Father.

10:44.715 --> 10:48.318
A passing knowledge. Certainly
not as extensive as your own.

10:48.353 --> 10:51.554
- And there's no doubt as to the cause of death, Doctor?
- None.

10:51.589 --> 10:54.124
Her skull was split open
by the edge of the spade.

10:54.158 --> 10:56.626
She died instantly. Father Keegan's

10:56.660 --> 10:58.661
initial assessment was accurate.

10:58.696 --> 11:01.964
Well, I've seen my share
of the dead. We both have,

11:01.999 --> 11:04.967
- haven't we, Will?
- (Bell ringing)

11:05.002 --> 11:07.303
(Keegan speaking Latin)

11:07.337 --> 11:09.338
- (thunder growling)
- (bell ringing)

11:11.409 --> 11:13.376
- (door opening)
- (wind whistling)

11:13.411 --> 11:16.012
Father! Father! Ship sinking.

11:16.046 --> 11:18.214
She's down on the rocks, a three-master!

11:18.248 --> 11:21.417
- Who'll help me man the lifeboat?
- All able-bodied men down to the beach.

11:21.451 --> 11:24.987
- You are excused from mass.
- (people talking indistinctly)

- Hurry!
- Let's go, boy!

11:49.679 --> 11:52.380
Will! We're going to need your help!

11:52.415 --> 11:54.449

Come on, Will! You have
nothing to fear from the dead.

Man, about 55 years of age.

Grey hair, full beard.

12:31.853 --> 12:34.488
- Blue eyes.

"Jeremiah Woodruff."

12:50.037 --> 12:52.739
There are 4 other crew members.

12:52.773 --> 12:54.975
They were transporting cod,

12:55.009 --> 12:56.942
and they had 2 paying passengers.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.012
Mr. Dawlish, a merchant,

- Mrs. Dawlish is in good hands, Will.

13:03.817 --> 13:06.319
You stay focused on what's before you.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.754
(Mrs. Dawlish grunting in pain)

13:15.161 --> 13:17.095
Dr. Grace, is there anything else

13:17.130 --> 13:19.097
you can glean from the
body of this poor soul?

13:19.132 --> 13:21.667
- I don't believe so.
- Then, Will,

13:21.701 --> 13:23.769
may I ask you to permit
the release of the body?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.771
In Father Lebel's
absence, I'd like to begin

13:25.805 --> 13:29.307
- arrangements for the funeral.
- I don't see why not, Father.

13:29.342 --> 13:31.643
Thank you. Doctor.

I'm sure he'll have an

If he returns.

13:52.397 --> 13:56.233
Father... this Bible,

13:56.268 --> 14:00.071
it isn't Father's Lebel's;
it's Jeanette Rajotte's.

14:00.105 --> 14:02.973
The dead woman's? What's it doing here?

14:03.007 --> 14:05.742
Perhaps it was Father Lebel

14:05.777 --> 14:07.811
that Jeanette Rajotte
was arguing with the night

14:07.845 --> 14:10.081
of her murder.

14:10.115 --> 14:12.316
One of the verses is marked.

14:12.350 --> 14:15.686
"For now we see through a glass darkly,

14:15.720 --> 14:17.688

First Corinthians, chapter 13, verse 12.

Have a look at this.

14:31.268 --> 14:33.236
What am I looking at?

14:33.270 --> 14:36.439
Possibly the reason why
Father Lebel had to disappear.

14:36.474 --> 14:39.075
"Now I know."

14:44.076 --> 14:46.308
(Brackenreid): "Now I
know"? What does that mean?

14:46.578 --> 14:48.579
That's a very good question.

14:48.613 --> 14:50.814
I'd say that Miss Rajotte knew something.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.632
She threatens the good Father,

14:52.633 --> 14:54.938
he does her in to keep her mouth
shut, and then he does a bunk.

14:54.963 --> 14:58.500
- That's rash speculation, Inspector.
- Bollocks! That was clearly a message meant for him.

14:58.734 --> 15:01.002
It was her Bible. It was on his desk.

15:01.036 --> 15:03.004
Maybe he hasn't left at all.

15:03.038 --> 15:05.506
Perhaps some harm has come to him also.

15:05.540 --> 15:07.574
Priests are men under the cloth,

15:07.609 --> 15:10.077
just like the rest of
us, Murdoch. Father Lebel

15:10.112 --> 15:12.613
was most likely up to something
he shouldn't have been.

15:12.648 --> 15:14.882
Sir, the information you requested

15:14.916 --> 15:18.853
- from the Catholic Register.
- Give it here, Crabtree.

15:18.887 --> 15:21.221
Father Daniel Lebel

15:21.256 --> 15:23.690
was transferred to the parish
of St. Francis a year ago.

15:23.724 --> 15:26.527
Yes. They needed a French-speaking priest.

15:26.561 --> 15:28.764
Before that, he was at the
parish of Saint-Urbain in Quebec.

15:28.765 --> 15:30.234
Stayed there for 8 months.

15:30.245 --> 15:32.212
Prior to that, the
parish of Sainte-Cécile

15:32.247 --> 15:34.147
in Gatineau, 7 months.

15:34.181 --> 15:37.283
Doesn't stick around very long does he?

15:37.317 --> 15:39.252
Sometimes, it takes a while

15:39.286 --> 15:41.187
for a young priest to
find the proper match.

15:41.222 --> 15:44.657
I was hoping that Father Lebel
would be settled at St. Francis.

15:44.691 --> 15:46.075
Sounds like an all-around misfit to me.

15:46.427 --> 15:48.729
Sir, you're making unwarranted assumptions.

15:48.764 --> 15:51.930
Nevertheless, we need a little
chat with your Father Lebel.

15:52.532 --> 15:55.801
Constables are asking around
the Catholic ward as we speak.

15:55.836 --> 15:58.036
- Someone has to have seen him.
- Sir.

15:58.071 --> 16:00.473
Madame Benoit is here to speak with you.

16:00.707 --> 16:03.642
What was the relationship
between Father Lebel

16:03.677 --> 16:06.412
- and Miss Rajotte?
- Relationship?

16:06.446 --> 16:09.415
I don't know what you mean. She
worked at the parish, cleaning.

16:09.449 --> 16:11.683
He was a priest.

16:11.717 --> 16:14.753
<i>- And he was a good priest?
- Oh oui, bien sûr.</i>

16:14.787 --> 16:17.122
I owe him everything this past year.

16:17.156 --> 16:19.124
I was so happy the day he married us,

16:19.158 --> 16:21.126
then my husband fell ill

16:21.160 --> 16:23.495
and everything changed.

16:23.529 --> 16:25.764
He never saw our child before he died.

16:25.798 --> 16:28.867
Father Lebel was so kind,
keeping me on at the presbytery.

16:28.901 --> 16:31.770
Yes, a child in the presbytery.

16:31.804 --> 16:33.772
That's most unusual, isn't it?

16:33.806 --> 16:36.374
This is what I mean. He looks after us.

16:36.409 --> 16:39.577
He's a good man.

16:40.012 --> 16:44.748
And when did you last
see Mademoiselle Rajotte?

16:44.783 --> 16:46.683
After supper.

16:46.718 --> 16:48.986
She cleaned up the kitchen,
then we all went to our rooms.

16:49.021 --> 16:51.789
<i>- Did you hear her leave?
- Non.</i>

16:51.823 --> 16:55.692
All right. Thank you, Madame Benoit.

16:55.727 --> 16:59.163
Detective.

16:59.197 --> 17:02.365
Mademoiselle Rajotte visited
her parents' grave that night.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.367
Who would have known this?

17:04.402 --> 17:07.304
Monsieur Robichaud. He would know.

17:07.338 --> 17:10.205
- Even that late?
- He works all hours.

17:10.241 --> 17:12.008
"Le bon Dieu n'a pas d'horloge,"

17:12.042 --> 17:15.412
is what he says. Our Lord
does not keep a time clock.

17:15.446 --> 17:19.449
<i>- Yes. Thank you again.
- Mon père.</i>

17:23.354 --> 17:25.887
And you're sure he knew that
you were coming to visit him?

17:25.923 --> 17:28.523
Oh, yes, yes. We corresponded.

17:28.559 --> 17:32.329
- So it makes no sense that he would leave suddenly.
- Unless, of course,

17:32.363 --> 17:35.164
he's involved in the young woman's murder.

17:35.198 --> 17:37.533
- I never said that, Father.
- No...

17:37.568 --> 17:39.569
but you are thinking it.

17:41.638 --> 17:43.606
We found this one down on the rocks.

17:43.640 --> 17:46.509
Looks like he tried to swim
ashore as the ship was sinking.

17:46.543 --> 17:49.044
(baby crying)

17:55.885 --> 17:58.120
Father. Come quickly.

17:58.154 --> 18:00.956
- She won't last much longer!
- Come on, Will.

18:02.825 --> 18:04.793
If you're not afraid of the dead,

18:04.827 --> 18:06.895
you can tolerate the dying. Come on.

18:06.929 --> 18:10.131
(baby crying)

18:10.165 --> 18:13.334
I'm here, my child. Are
you of the Catholic faith?

18:13.369 --> 18:15.336
Yes, I am.

18:15.371 --> 18:17.973
Then I must prepare you to meet your maker.

18:18.007 --> 18:22.010
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid.

18:22.044 --> 18:24.645
Today, you'll rest in paradise

18:24.679 --> 18:28.116
in the arms of our Lord Jesus Christ.

18:28.150 --> 18:31.319
Were any saved from the ship?

18:31.353 --> 18:33.454
The villagers brought in the last man now.

18:33.489 --> 18:35.456
Your husband, I believe.

18:35.491 --> 18:38.292
My husband?

18:38.327 --> 18:40.728
He has blond hair. He
has a fur-trimmed coat.

18:40.762 --> 18:44.398
- (thunder growling)
- Is the man dead?

18:44.432 --> 18:47.467
Yes, child.

18:49.771 --> 18:52.072
He tried to save me, Father.

18:52.106 --> 18:54.274
Please...

18:54.308 --> 18:56.309
pray for his soul.

18:56.344 --> 18:58.345
I shall.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.649
You must look in the coat.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.519
There are gold coins
and diamonds in the hem.

19:05.553 --> 19:07.921
Please...

19:07.955 --> 19:10.223
make sure this money

19:10.258 --> 19:15.161
is used to raise this poor orphaned infant.

19:15.195 --> 19:18.097
- Promise me.
- I promise.

19:18.131 --> 19:20.132
I promise. I promise.

19:20.167 --> 19:23.002
But now, I must hear your confession.

No. Wickley's bread.

20:06.477 --> 20:08.878
Pure and white, take a bite.

20:08.912 --> 20:10.880
Wickley's bread.

20:10.914 --> 20:12.882
Pure never tasted so good.

20:12.916 --> 20:14.850
Crabtree, what are you rattling on about?

20:14.885 --> 20:16.786
Wickley's bread, sir.

20:16.820 --> 20:19.088
I'm trying to come up with a
slogan extolling its virtues.

Virtues, phoo! Dreadful stuff.

20:21.424 --> 20:23.392
That factory bread can't hold a candle

20:23.426 --> 20:25.394
- to Margaret's homebaked.
- Perhaps, sir, but it's awfully

20:25.428 --> 20:27.997
convenient for people who are
too busy to toil at the oven.

20:28.031 --> 20:30.299
Too lazy, you mean. Next
thing you know, they'll be

20:30.333 --> 20:34.603
- slicing it up for you.
- Sir, that's a fantastic idea!

20:34.637 --> 20:37.573
I've never got the hang of
slicing a piece of bread, sir.

20:37.607 --> 20:39.575
Look, it always comes out like that.

20:39.609 --> 20:42.477
And the end piece, that's
a recipe for self-injury.

20:42.512 --> 20:45.314
Sliced bread would be the
greatest thing since... since...

- Huh?

20:47.350 --> 20:49.318
- It's too fluffy.
- It is a bit fluffy, sir.

20:49.352 --> 20:51.953
Give me a slice of bread
that sticks to the ribs.

Sounds to me like we're

I made a promise that I intend to keep.

23:25.562 --> 23:28.531
This money is the babe's inheritance.

23:28.565 --> 23:31.066
- (thunder clapping)
- Father.

23:33.820 --> 23:36.756
Oh, the deuce!

23:36.790 --> 23:38.524
(Keegan sighs.)

23:38.559 --> 23:41.393
Tell me, what do you think
is unusual about this, Will?

23:41.428 --> 23:44.263
He's not dressed like a merchant.

23:44.297 --> 23:46.365
He's wearing sailor's clothes.

23:46.399 --> 23:48.967
Indeed. Feel this.

23:49.001 --> 23:51.770
- His hands are rough.
- Mm-hmm.

23:51.804 --> 23:53.472
Not the soft hands of a merchant.

23:53.506 --> 23:55.207
Tell me, do you think this Abigail

23:55.241 --> 23:57.742
looked like the type of woman
who would marry a sailor?

23:57.777 --> 24:00.045
Do you see where I made my mistake?

24:00.080 --> 24:02.213
- No, I don't.
- She did not

24:02.247 --> 24:04.883
directly say that the
blond man was her husband.

24:04.917 --> 24:07.752
I made that assumption
based on his fine coat.

24:07.787 --> 24:10.789
Her husband must be
amongst these other men.

24:10.823 --> 24:13.992
(thunder growling)

24:21.967 --> 24:23.734
Ah, yes.

24:23.768 --> 24:26.670
Our merchant, I do believe.

24:26.705 --> 24:29.673
And a man of considerable vanity.

24:29.708 --> 24:31.675
He dyes his hair and his beard.

24:31.710 --> 24:33.777
A poor old man trying to
keep up with a young wife.

24:35.680 --> 24:38.015
Father. Look at the tear in his vest

24:38.049 --> 24:39.984
right above his heart.

24:41.987 --> 24:45.923
A wound. Most likely a knife.

24:45.957 --> 24:49.559
Will, our blond sailor may
have a knife on his person.

24:49.594 --> 24:52.462
Let's go have a look.

24:54.298 --> 24:59.169
- Check his boots.
- (Man coughing)

24:59.203 --> 25:01.738
- Father Keegan.
- Hmm.

25:05.009 --> 25:07.377
Ah...

25:07.527 --> 25:09.461
I was wrong, he didn't drown.

25:09.495 --> 25:11.463
There's blood on it.

25:11.497 --> 25:14.466
The sheath protected it from the sea.

25:14.500 --> 25:17.569
And it's been used recently.

25:17.603 --> 25:20.139
The sea didn't kill her husband;

25:20.173 --> 25:22.241
the sailor did.

25:22.275 --> 25:25.277
So a country priest and a
12-year-old boy got something wrong.

25:25.311 --> 25:27.279
What has that got to do with
your priest's disappearance?

25:27.313 --> 25:29.080
The point is, Inspector,

25:29.114 --> 25:31.082
one should not be too quick to judge.

25:31.116 --> 25:33.752
If Lebel is innocent,

25:33.786 --> 25:36.288
- why would he run?
- I don't know.

25:36.322 --> 25:39.524
What other explanation
could there be but his guilt?

25:39.558 --> 25:42.827
- Is that the only conclusion?
- (Thunder growling)

25:42.861 --> 25:44.896
If the sailor killed
Miss Abigail's husband,

25:44.930 --> 25:47.298
why did she say he helped her?

25:47.332 --> 25:49.300
Why did she seem so sad he was dead?

25:49.334 --> 25:52.336
- And why do you think?
- Perhaps they both did it?

25:52.370 --> 25:54.772
And do you really believe
that? She was facing her maker.

25:54.807 --> 25:57.141
She had an opportunity to confess her sins.

25:57.176 --> 25:59.710
Besides which, she didn't
look like a murderer.

25:59.744 --> 26:01.712
She was too beautiful.

26:01.746 --> 26:04.348
Well, history is strewn

26:04.382 --> 26:08.018
of tales of wicked women
who were also beauties, Will.

26:08.052 --> 26:10.921
You can't only trust your heart.

26:10.955 --> 26:14.825
Go back to logic. What did you observe?

26:14.859 --> 26:17.160
There's blood coming from her mouth.

26:17.195 --> 26:19.262
Is that normal when a baby is born?

26:22.566 --> 26:24.567
No, it's not.

26:26.704 --> 26:28.671
You see those bruises, Will?

26:28.706 --> 26:31.708
She didn't get them
from falling off a boat.

26:31.742 --> 26:34.510
She also had injuries to her torso, Father.

26:34.545 --> 26:36.512
Thank you, Mrs. Cameron.

26:36.547 --> 26:39.582
The bruise is a strange shape.

26:40.584 --> 26:42.552
The man we identified as the merchant,

26:42.586 --> 26:44.554

square toe fits the bruise?

He kicked her.

27:04.457 --> 27:07.125
- Yes, he did.
- But she was his wife.

27:07.159 --> 27:10.161
There is evil in all
men, Will. Remember that.

27:10.195 --> 27:13.197
Is this why the sailor killed her husband?

27:16.335 --> 27:18.570
- Perhaps.
- (Thunder growling)

27:18.604 --> 27:22.706
Or perhaps the sailor was merely a thief.

27:22.741 --> 27:25.743
- I don't think so, Father.
- Why not?

27:25.777 --> 27:28.612
He was wearing the coat with the
diamonds and the coins sewn in it.

27:28.647 --> 27:30.614
He took the coat,

27:30.649 --> 27:32.616
but we don't know if he knew
there was anything in it.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.819
Continue.

27:34.853 --> 27:36.821
And if he was a thief,

27:36.855 --> 27:39.222
he would have stolen the merchant's rings,

27:39.257 --> 27:42.493
- or his money purse.
- What are you thinking, Will?

27:42.527 --> 27:44.862
Remember,

27:44.896 --> 27:47.030
Miss Abigail worried for the sailor.

27:47.065 --> 27:49.032
She cared for him.

27:49.067 --> 27:52.169
Yes, she did.

27:54.538 --> 27:57.107
Maybe he felt the same way.

27:57.141 --> 27:59.176
Perhaps he caught the merchant

27:59.210 --> 28:01.878
mistreating his wife and took action.

28:01.912 --> 28:03.680
So we'll only know the truth once we find

28:03.714 --> 28:06.649
the elusive Father Lebel.
How are we going to do that?

28:06.684 --> 28:09.819
A priest's flock is his family.

28:09.854 --> 28:12.622
And as such, he would never abandon them.

Jeanette Rajotte tomorrow.

28:21.031 --> 28:23.199
is the priest that you say he is,

28:23.233 --> 28:25.201
he'll be there.

28:25.235 --> 28:27.403
- And what if he's her murderer?
- Oh, well,

28:27.437 --> 28:30.172
then he'll be in even more need
of the sanctuary of the church.

28:30.207 --> 28:33.742
- And the confessional.
- For forgiveness of sin.

28:33.776 --> 28:36.578
But, Father, you must understand
that if he does return,

in Québec. They're

None of the young men

Yes, of course.

35:27.414 --> 35:30.416
Perhaps you could have
shared that with me as well.

35:46.065 --> 35:49.034
I cannot call you Father.

35:49.068 --> 35:51.069
How shall I address you?

35:51.104 --> 35:53.872
In the eyes of God, I am a priest.

35:53.906 --> 35:58.010
In the eyes of the Catholic
Church, you are an impostor.

35:59.679 --> 36:01.747
Women cannot be ordained.

36:01.781 --> 36:04.516
Priests are descendants from the apostles.

36:04.550 --> 36:06.652
Jesus chose men to be apostles.

36:06.686 --> 36:10.756
I was chosen to interpret
the word of God as a priest.

36:10.790 --> 36:14.059
It's a rather heretical point of view.

36:14.093 --> 36:16.427
I'm surprised you continue to be a Catholic

36:16.462 --> 36:18.663
<i>- if you believe that... 
- I love my Church, détective.</i>

36:18.697 --> 36:20.698
I was answering God's call

36:20.732 --> 36:22.767
<i>to devote my life to his service,</i>

36:22.801 --> 36:25.970
even though I was born a woman.

36:26.004 --> 36:28.273
You could have taken
the veil, become a nun.

36:28.307 --> 36:32.643
As you say, priests are the
one who are close to God.

36:32.678 --> 36:36.246
I prayed and he spoke to me.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.815
God spoke and told me who I am.

36:38.849 --> 36:40.850
I am a priest.

36:42.352 --> 36:44.320
But then you were found out.

36:44.354 --> 36:47.256
Your servant learned the
truth, and you killed her.

36:47.291 --> 36:49.392
<i>- Non!
- Then why did you run?</i>

36:49.426 --> 36:51.594
No one would understand.

36:51.628 --> 36:53.929
I needed to think,

36:53.963 --> 36:57.132
to talk to God and ask for his guidance.

36:59.936 --> 37:01.970
Right. So you say you did not

37:02.005 --> 37:03.906
kill Jeanette Rajotte?

37:03.940 --> 37:07.042
I did not take her life.

37:07.077 --> 37:10.512
<i>Jeanette, cette pauvre enfant.</i>

37:10.546 --> 37:13.615
May God rest her soul.

37:16.986 --> 37:18.954
<i>(Brackenreid): Have you charged the priest?</i>

37:18.988 --> 37:21.356
- Not as of yet.
- What are you waiting for?

37:21.390 --> 37:24.727
She's an imposter that Jeanette
Rajotte was prepared to unmask.

37:24.761 --> 37:26.728
She killed the girl to
protect herself and then ran.

37:26.762 --> 37:28.896
Sir, she speaks with such utter sincerity,

37:28.931 --> 37:30.898
I'm inclined to believe her.

37:30.933 --> 37:33.167
Murdoch, are you sure

37:33.202 --> 37:35.903
you're not still letting
Keegan influence you?

37:41.410 --> 37:43.477
Father Keegan withheld the truth from you

37:43.511 --> 37:46.680
- for reasons he felt valid.
- Yes, I know, but still...

37:46.715 --> 37:49.617
You take it personally.

37:49.651 --> 37:52.253
It's understandable. You feel betrayed.

37:52.287 --> 37:55.957
I'm a grown man, I'm sure I'll recover.

37:55.991 --> 37:58.192
This isn't the first
time this has happened...

37:58.227 --> 38:00.394
a woman impersonating a man.

38:00.428 --> 38:03.264
The Catholic Church has
Saint Marina the monk,

38:03.298 --> 38:05.266
not to mention Joan of Arc.

38:05.300 --> 38:07.668
Julia, I'm not sure a
history lesson is going

38:07.702 --> 38:09.703
to help me solve this murder.

38:09.738 --> 38:12.873
Think about the psychology
behind such impersonations.

38:12.907 --> 38:15.542
An intense identification with men for one.

38:15.577 --> 38:17.911
Safety, for another.

38:17.945 --> 38:19.880
But it is usually that a woman can only get

38:19.914 --> 38:22.749
what she wants by disguising
herself as the opposite sex.

38:22.784 --> 38:25.685
So if you had been prevented
from becoming a doctor...

38:25.719 --> 38:28.088
Perhaps I'd be like Margaret Bulkley

38:28.122 --> 38:30.257
who became Dr. James Barry

38:30.291 --> 38:32.259
and performed surgery for many years.

38:32.293 --> 38:35.728
Think of all the people who would
have died if she'd remained a woman.

38:35.763 --> 38:39.031
Yes, but Margaret Bulkley
genuinely healed people.

38:39.065 --> 38:41.033
Father Lebel

38:41.067 --> 38:43.035
performed sacraments which are now invalid.

38:43.069 --> 38:46.372
So all the past year's births,

38:46.407 --> 38:48.775
deaths, and marriages at St.
Francis are null and void?

38:48.809 --> 38:51.243
Father Keegan assures me the
Church will make it right.

38:51.278 --> 38:53.078
How?

38:53.113 --> 38:55.214
I suppose they'll send another priest,

38:55.248 --> 38:57.216
redo the sacraments.

38:57.250 --> 38:59.451
But what if it can't be made right?

38:59.485 --> 39:01.453
What do you mean?

39:01.487 --> 39:05.090
What if Father Lebel performed
sacraments that can't be redone?

39:05.125 --> 39:07.793
Marriage for instance. A widow

39:07.827 --> 39:10.796
would lose her husband's estate
if she were suddenly unmarried.

39:10.830 --> 39:12.464
<i>There it is!</i>

39:12.498 --> 39:16.401

39:16.436 --> 39:20.004
He knows you're not a
priest! You're a woman!

39:20.039 --> 39:23.942
So you think Madame Benoit is our murderer?

39:23.976 --> 39:26.811
Constables are searching her
room at the presbytery now.

39:26.906 --> 39:30.174
Well, it makes sense to me,
Murdoch. Why won't she believe

39:30.209 --> 39:32.176
the doctrine she'd been
taught all her life?

39:32.211 --> 39:35.213
It would never occur to her that the
Church could somehow magically fix it all

39:35.247 --> 39:37.848
- for her and her child.
- Sirs.

39:37.883 --> 39:41.552
We found this in Madame Benoit's armoire.

39:41.586 --> 39:43.987
Bring her in, Murdoch.

If Madame Benoit did kill Jeanette Rajotte,

40:02.807 --> 40:05.342
it was only to protect her infant.

A noble motive makes
her no less a murderer.

She'll tell me what she did,

That's for the bishops to decide.

42:13.588 --> 42:15.789
I expect she'll be excommunicated.

42:15.823 --> 42:17.891
Cutting her off from the very thing

42:17.925 --> 42:19.926
- that gave her life meaning.
- I'm afraid so.

42:19.960 --> 42:22.296
Will you be leaving immediately?

42:22.330 --> 42:24.964
Tomorrow. I'll celebrate the mass

Off to advise somewhere else.
