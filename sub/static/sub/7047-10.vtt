WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.586
Previously on Justified...

00:03.671 --> 00:06.839
They'll come into a town like Somerset
and they'll blow up a car.

00:07.132 --> 00:09.759
Then while the cops are busy,
they'll go rob a bank.

00:12.471 --> 00:13.763
Fire in the hole!

00:18.477 --> 00:23.856
Fandi is Ethiopian by way of Jamaica
by way of being completely full of shit.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.942
Well, Reverend? What do you think?

00:26.944 --> 00:30.029
I don't know, you know. It was dark,
and the man was far away.

00:30.114 --> 00:32.782
If you've had anybody shoot a rocket at you,
you know, I just run.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.992
The only viable charges
that we have against him

00:35.077 --> 00:38.287
are predicated upon the testimony
of Ms. Crowder and yourself.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.456
And now that you both have been
compromised as witnesses,

00:40.541 --> 00:41.916
we're gonna have to release Boyd Crowder.

00:46.255 --> 00:49.632
So, you get out of McCreary,
you come back home to Harlan,

00:49.717 --> 00:53.594
and you go straight back to cooking
and using methamphetamine?

00:53.679 --> 00:56.764
- And now you want to stop.
- I surely do.

00:57.683 --> 00:59.058
All of it?

00:59.685 --> 01:01.894
Are you willing to forsake your life of crime,

01:01.979 --> 01:04.563
your drug addiction,
and walk the road of righteousness?

01:04.690 --> 01:05.815
I am.

01:05.899 --> 01:07.066
Whatever it takes?

01:08.819 --> 01:10.361
What if I was to say to you

01:10.487 --> 01:14.073
that you use methamphetamine again,
I'll shoot you in the head?

01:14.575 --> 01:16.492
I wouldn't use again?

01:16.660 --> 01:19.954
Now, all them threats made against you,
long down the years, all them,

01:20.038 --> 01:23.458
"God damn it, Bobby Joe, you better stop
using methamphetamine or else!"

01:23.667 --> 01:25.084
Did they have any effect?

01:26.128 --> 01:27.462
No.

01:27.546 --> 01:29.088
You know why?

01:30.132 --> 01:31.215
No.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.844
'Cause the stick don't work, son.

01:36.221 --> 01:39.098
Now, the only thing that does work
is the carrot!

01:39.224 --> 01:43.561
The carrot that we offer in this church
is a purpose, a reason for being,

01:43.645 --> 01:47.398
much greater than
any of you have ever known.

01:49.193 --> 01:53.237
Why, US Deputy Marshal Raylan Givens
played a pivotal role in my story.

01:53.322 --> 01:55.448
And while we don't have saints
in our church,

01:55.532 --> 01:58.910
if we did, he would be the first...
Saint Raylan.

01:59.036 --> 02:04.957
For he worked a miracle in my life
and was the agent of my salvation.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.627
Patron saint of lost causes, I suspect.

02:07.711 --> 02:10.338
Well, there already is one...
That's Saint Jude.

02:10.422 --> 02:13.132
Oh, well, there you go, another lost cause.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.760
Well, I hope there's a story
to go with that face.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.553
Nothing dramatic.

02:17.805 --> 02:21.682
- We weren't too hard to find, were we?
- No, no. Your directions were clear.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.726
Your intent, not so much.

02:23.811 --> 02:27.730
Flock, if you will excuse me for a moment.
Let's take a walk.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.106
Flock?

02:29.191 --> 02:31.943
Devil told me you went by to see him.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.778
Were you able to get him
to testify against me?

02:33.862 --> 02:39.033
- I heard you're still trying to make a case.
- Yeah, I am. I talked to Dewey, too.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.493
Couldn't get nothing there, either.

02:40.577 --> 02:42.161
You know, he gets out soon.

02:42.246 --> 02:45.790
I get the feeling he's looking forward to
joining your Boy Scout camp.

02:45.874 --> 02:47.917
- It's a church, Raylan.
- The old one was better.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.754
In your dark imagining, Raylan,
what is it that you think I'm up to?

02:51.964 --> 02:53.464
Given the talent pool you've got here,

02:53.549 --> 02:55.800
I assume you're gonna do
what you always done,

02:55.884 --> 02:57.468
steal money and blow shit up.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.136
We will not be robbing banks.

02:59.221 --> 03:01.097
Could you be any more vague?

03:01.181 --> 03:06.143
All of us here, every single one of us,
have repaid our debts to society.

03:06.228 --> 03:09.814
No, no, no, not you. Not by a long shot.

03:10.023 --> 03:15.111
Well, out here, in our church, we can
begin to repay our debts to God

03:15.195 --> 03:17.113
by righteous living, righteous action.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.073
Can I go now?

03:19.283 --> 03:22.869
Well, you sure you don't want a meal?
Our food is simple, but it's good.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.538
No, I stopped at a Hardee's on the way.

03:25.831 --> 03:28.916
I wouldn't mind addressing
the congregation before I went.

03:29.001 --> 03:30.293
Would that be all right?

03:31.086 --> 03:33.629
Excuse me!
We have us a guest speaker today.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.756
- Please, have at it.
- Yeah.

03:40.178 --> 03:46.976
Dear Lord, before we eat this meal,
we ask forgiveness for our sins,

03:47.060 --> 03:51.772
especially Boyd, who blew up a black church
with a rocket launcher,

03:52.274 --> 03:55.192
and afterwards,
he shot his associate, Jared Hale,

03:55.277 --> 03:58.029
in the back of the head
out on Tates Creek Bridge.

03:58.155 --> 04:03.367
Let the image of Jared's brain matter on that
windshield not dampen our appetites,

04:03.452 --> 04:08.080
but may the knowledge of Boyd's past sins
help guide these men.

04:08.540 --> 04:13.336
May this food provide them
with all the nourishment they need.

04:13.545 --> 04:17.923
But if it does not,
may they find comfort in knowing

04:18.007 --> 04:24.388
that the United States Marshals Service
is offering $50,000 to any individual

04:24.473 --> 04:28.100
providing information
that'll put Boyd back in prison.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.435
Cash or check.

04:29.519 --> 04:33.814
We can make it out to them,
or to Jesus, whoever they want.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.903
In your name, we pray. Amen.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.450
Boyd.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.370
Raylan.

05:28.286 --> 05:29.745
God damn it!

05:29.830 --> 05:31.163
In here?

05:33.625 --> 05:35.751
Well, what are you waiting for?
I'm injured here!

05:35.836 --> 05:38.879
Harder. Harder! Now, spit it out.

05:40.132 --> 05:42.883
This here's Brandy.
She's taking precautionary measures.

05:42.968 --> 05:44.885
- Hi.
- Did I say stop?

05:45.679 --> 05:47.388
I'm about to hop in the sack.
Next thing you know,

05:47.472 --> 05:52.143
a goddamn Cottonmouth about to
fix its fangs right into my you-know-what.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.520
That would have been the case,
I would have called Jack Kevorkian

05:54.604 --> 05:55.896
instead of 911.

05:55.981 --> 05:59.692
Yeah, it was a matter of life and death.
It was biblical, so...

05:59.776 --> 06:01.986
Just relax, Your Honor.
We'll get you squared away.

06:02.070 --> 06:05.448
Ma'am, you can stop sucking.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.246
Should I even ask how
a man can go on a week's R&R

06:12.330 --> 06:15.207
and come back looking like
he's been run over by an F-150?

06:16.793 --> 06:18.961
- Fishing.
- Did you take your gun fishing?

06:19.963 --> 06:23.591
You didn't think the LPD was gonna tell
me about that little shootout you got into?

06:23.675 --> 06:27.219
I wasn't in a shootout, I was just near one.

06:28.138 --> 06:30.973
Before we go, what's going on
with the Boyd Crowder case?

06:31.183 --> 06:32.516
No, Raylan.

06:32.601 --> 06:37.897
The only reason that you are here is because
you have been personally requested.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.066
Last night, Judge Michael Reardon,

06:40.150 --> 06:42.568
who we know affectionately
as "Mike the Hammer,"

06:42.778 --> 06:47.865
was bitten by a poisonous snake
about six inches from home plate.

06:48.033 --> 06:51.869
The Judge is a very colorful character,
as we know.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.413
He likes to carry a sidearm under his robe

06:54.498 --> 06:56.624
in case anybody decides to
light up the bench.

06:56.708 --> 07:01.670
Plenty of people would have cause.
That's hate mail. He sent it over for review.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.132
So these are his trophies from past years?

07:05.217 --> 07:07.301
Something like that,
only that's the last six months.

07:07.385 --> 07:11.722
Now, look, I want you to cross-reference
all the arrest records and the parolees

07:11.807 --> 07:14.391
and see if we can't come up
with somebody from the backwoods

07:14.476 --> 07:17.561
who's used to handling snakes
and could have used one for a weapon.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.606
And, Nelson,
you're gonna take the day detail,

07:20.690 --> 07:24.652
and, Raylan, he has specifically
requested you for the night.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.822
- My nights are free.
- Not anymore.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.283
I'm telling you,
you just toss that sucker in there... Boom.

07:31.493 --> 07:32.827
- Here, watch.
- Got it. You do it.

07:32.911 --> 07:35.704
- I got it, right there. Go ahead.
- Yeah.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.499
- Just put it in.
- All right.

07:43.755 --> 07:46.257
- I told you.
- Hello, Mickey.

07:47.926 --> 07:51.762
Well, what are you doing out here, Boyd?

07:52.139 --> 07:54.598
I already told your father we ain't paying.

07:54.683 --> 07:58.811
Well, I'm not here on behalf of my father.
At least not my Earthly one.

08:01.273 --> 08:02.731
Hello, there, masked man!

08:03.066 --> 08:07.903
If you ain't out here extorting payment,
then what can I do for ya?

08:07.988 --> 08:11.490
- You can stop what you're doing here.
- Playing bullets?

08:11.783 --> 08:13.826
Cooking methamphetamine.

08:13.994 --> 08:15.911
Well, I don't know
what you're talking about, Boyd.

08:16.163 --> 08:20.249
Methamphetamine is a modern-day plague,
like locusts, only worse.

08:20.834 --> 08:24.003
The havoc that it has wreaked
upon the people of Harlan County

08:24.087 --> 08:27.298
and places like it is immeasurable.

08:30.760 --> 08:34.763
Now, you know what the problem with
redneck Russian roulette is, don't you?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.015
What's that?

08:36.099 --> 08:39.268
Well, you get so distracted,
you can't hear nothing.

08:44.608 --> 08:46.942
Bobby Joe, you the cause of all this?

08:48.111 --> 08:52.448
Bobby Joe joined the winning team.
There's always room for three more.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.451
Now, you listen up, you crazy little shit.

08:55.619 --> 08:58.954
You best get to the shooting,
or you all get the hell out of here.

08:59.331 --> 09:04.460
You got me all wrong, Mick.
I come in peace, and I will leave in peace.

09:05.128 --> 09:09.798
But if I come back out here again
and you're still cooking up that poison...

09:10.133 --> 09:12.885
Well, be careful what you're doing in there,
masked man.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.846
I hear these things blow up all the time.

09:24.147 --> 09:27.483
Court is adjourned
till 8:30 tomorrow morning.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.822
- Dunlop.
- He's all yours.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.659
Your Honor.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.662
Well, it is a pleasure to meet you, son.
Look at you.

09:39.746 --> 09:42.748
You are every inch
the goddamn gunslinger I heard.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.083
I like the war wounds, too.

09:44.167 --> 09:47.920
It's good to know
that you don't mind mixing it up.

09:50.423 --> 09:55.594
Yeah. Rumors are true.
Nothing but a bathing suit and Brownie.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.347
- I heard about the gun.
- Goddamn right you did.

09:58.515 --> 10:03.269
Well, that chickenshit snake charmer
wouldn't come into my courtroom,

10:03.353 --> 10:06.355
'cause he knew I would have
peeled a couple right back at him.

10:06.564 --> 10:10.276
- And the swimwear?
- My personality invites derision.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.529
Rumor was I was mental.

10:13.613 --> 10:18.617
Then it really changed to I was a pervert
who wore ladies' underwear.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.745
And then, what was it?
A thong under my robe.

10:21.871 --> 10:25.165
Then one day I said, "Well, the hell with it,"
and I went right at the joke.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.459
The thing is, it's comfortable.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.713
Tried it on and it fit. Sure, I get that.

10:30.880 --> 10:33.882
If it adds to the legend, so much the better.

10:34.384 --> 10:36.927
- Frankly, Your Honor, I get that, too.
- I knew you would.

10:37.053 --> 10:41.682
You can knock off that "Your Honor" stuff.
"Sir" is fine.

10:41.766 --> 10:45.811
- Hey, what, uh, what are you packing?
- .45-caliber Glock.

10:45.937 --> 10:48.355
Damn, all I got's a.38. But you know what?

10:48.440 --> 10:54.278
I practice every week at the range,
center mass 9 times out of 10.

10:54.571 --> 10:55.946
I know what you're thinking.

10:56.072 --> 11:01.452
You're thinking, "Sure, hell,
I could hit the sweet spot on 100 targets,

11:01.578 --> 11:07.833
"but I would still have no idea
what it's like to pull and put down a man."

11:08.418 --> 11:11.170
And that's true. That's why I picked you.

11:11.254 --> 11:14.465
I know that you're in all sorts of shit

11:14.632 --> 11:19.345
from David Vasquez
over that Tommy Bucks shooting in Miami.

11:19.596 --> 11:24.266
I look at those reports,
and I say, "Well done!"

11:24.351 --> 11:27.936
You know, one less predator
to come after the herd.

11:28.021 --> 11:32.358
Am I right, huh? I know I am.
You don't have to answer me.

11:32.484 --> 11:33.525
Let's get.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.872
What the hell?

12:21.324 --> 12:24.493
God damn it! Get away from me.

12:25.328 --> 12:26.995
God damn it.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.221
Carbon monoxide.

12:44.514 --> 12:47.433
Apparently, there was a failure
in the Judge's exhaust system,

12:47.517 --> 12:49.726
and it was being pumped into the interior.

12:50.019 --> 12:53.272
Sounds about as accidental
as a snake in the bed.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.608
So, how is the Judge treating you?

12:57.360 --> 12:59.862
Did you know he wore a red Speedo
under his gown?

12:59.946 --> 13:03.615
That's always been the legend.
Never had it confirmed until now.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.077
Well, I appreciate you warning me.

13:07.245 --> 13:10.664
Whoever that dickhead is,
I got no respect for him, you know?

13:10.748 --> 13:14.251
Come at me with a gun, be a man.
We got any suspects?

13:14.878 --> 13:19.756
- Every judge has his enemies, huh?
- And me in particular, yeah.

13:19.883 --> 13:23.218
"Mike the Hammer
and his Draconian sentences."

13:23.303 --> 13:24.553
Am I saying that right, "Draconian"?

13:25.889 --> 13:31.560
Anyway, I'm supposed to be a friend
to the prosecutor.

13:31.728 --> 13:34.605
That's what they say.
Well, guilty as charged.

13:34.731 --> 13:36.648
Do you have any idea who it could be?

13:36.733 --> 13:40.694
Honestly, Deputy, I've adjudicated
so many cases, they're all a blur.

13:40.778 --> 13:44.781
I'll tell you what,
just give me a list of your top five suspects.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.867
I'll take a look at it, see who pops.

13:46.951 --> 13:51.580
Better yet, make it a top ten list,
we'll put my ex-wives on it.

13:54.459 --> 13:57.503
Are you gonna marry that gal
you chucked the Crowder case over?

13:58.505 --> 14:00.923
Sorry. Courthouse scuttlebutt.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.385
- What was her name?
- Ava.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.513
- Was she worth it?
- Seemed so at the time.

14:07.597 --> 14:11.683
Yeah. Yeah, well, I'm not the type
to stare at the ice in my glass.

14:11.768 --> 14:13.143
Nothing but regret there.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.728
I'm not sure that's what I was getting at.

14:14.812 --> 14:16.980
Well, I hope so, because that ain't no good,

14:17.106 --> 14:19.274
just picking over old bones, is it?

14:19.526 --> 14:23.362
You need to, you make a change.
You keep moving. You want another one?

14:23.488 --> 14:26.031
No, I'll just keep sucking on my ice
for a while.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.282
Okay.

14:31.621 --> 14:34.206
Can I ask you your opinion on
something, though, sir?

14:34.290 --> 14:37.709
That's my raison d'être, ain't it?
Shoot.

14:38.628 --> 14:41.505
Well, it's about Ava,
since you brought her up.

14:41.631 --> 14:47.094
You know, prior to my involvement with her,
she shot and killed her husband, Bowman,

14:47.178 --> 14:48.971
with a hunting rifle.

14:49.389 --> 14:55.310
And since then, she's been getting threats
from the entire Crowder clan, pretty much.

14:55.478 --> 14:58.564
But her probation doesn't allow her
to get out of the state of Kentucky.

14:58.648 --> 15:01.733
And you want me to call her judge
down in Harlan.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.903
No way. Absolutely not.
It's not gonna happen.

15:04.988 --> 15:08.824
You know, I'm not gonna piss
in another man's sandbox.

15:09.993 --> 15:11.493
Fair enough.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.831
- Cousin Johnny!
- Hello, Boyd.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.750
I like what you've done with the place.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.920
Well, you know what Rome looked like
before it became Rome, don't you?

15:22.171 --> 15:26.508
Some huts on the side of a hill,
little stream running through it.

15:27.010 --> 15:30.345
What it became... Well, as they say,
it didn't happen in a day.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.600
So, you're building Rome?

15:34.892 --> 15:36.893
Well, I don't think this property
is zoned for that.

15:37.020 --> 15:40.689
As good as it is to see you, primo,
and it's mighty good,

15:40.773 --> 15:45.068
I don't think you came all the way out here
to speak to me about ancient Rome.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.862
Did my daddy send you?

15:46.946 --> 15:49.281
Well, he hasn't seen much of you
since he brought you back to Harlan.

15:49.365 --> 15:51.742
Well, I told him I was starting a church.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.703
Yeah, and he embraces that, Boyd,
with all his might.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.997
It's always good to have
someone in the family praying for you.

15:57.081 --> 15:58.749
Well, that I am.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.752
I don't suppose you coming out here

16:01.878 --> 16:05.255
has anything to do with my visit
to Ransom Holler yesterday?

16:05.381 --> 16:06.381
Course it does.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.092
Mickey called your daddy,
asked if he sent you.

16:09.218 --> 16:12.721
- Said you threatened to blow up his shit.
- Well, that's not true.

16:13.056 --> 16:15.349
I asked him to shut down his poison factory

16:15.433 --> 16:18.435
and merely made an observation
about its combustibility.

16:19.562 --> 16:22.064
Well, that's just you being clever, isn't it?

16:22.398 --> 16:25.651
Blood is blood, Cousin.
But you don't screw with a man's business.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.737
Well, as I heard it from Mickey,
my father has no business with him.

16:28.821 --> 16:31.615
Well, he will.
Old Bo can be mighty persuasive.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.325
I remember.

16:34.410 --> 16:36.662
Well, you all done here?

16:36.746 --> 16:39.498
You know, Boyd, actually, one more word.

16:40.249 --> 16:41.750
In private.

16:44.170 --> 16:47.506
- What have you got going on here?
- A church.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.425
Yeah, see, I can't tell
if you're full of shit or not.

16:50.593 --> 16:53.428
Yeah, well, have a little faith, Cousin.

16:53.763 --> 16:55.847
Okay. Well, listen, all I know

16:55.932 --> 16:59.434
is that white-supremacy thing you had
going on before, that was on the money.

16:59.519 --> 17:00.644
Shit, you want to rob some banks,

17:00.770 --> 17:02.479
get some of them knucklehead Nazis
do it for you.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.439
That shit was genius.

17:04.523 --> 17:09.069
Now, you come up with something
that smart again, I'll back your play.

17:09.404 --> 17:11.363
And what about my daddy?

17:11.446 --> 17:14.825
Your daddy. Come on, man.
Old Bo, he's got, what, 10 years left, at best?

17:15.284 --> 17:16.702
He's on the down slope.

17:16.786 --> 17:19.788
Well, aren't we all, unless we start taking
the path that leads up?

17:20.123 --> 17:23.083
See, now, there you go again.
Bullshit or true belief, I just can't tell.

17:23.166 --> 17:26.127
Truth always sounds like lies to a sinner.

17:27.922 --> 17:30.090
Man, you are good, Cousin.

17:42.854 --> 17:44.020
Excuse me!

17:45.148 --> 17:46.815
What do you want?

17:47.942 --> 17:49.151
Police, huh?

17:52.155 --> 17:56.742
I'm not a cop.
I am a deputy, a US Marshal.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.327
- What is your name?
- Bunny Higgins.

18:00.037 --> 18:03.165
I would have guessed "Terrance"
or "Wesley."

18:04.208 --> 18:08.295
Yeah, I got an Uncle Leslie,
which is kind of weird.

18:08.463 --> 18:11.506
Yeah. And, what's going on there
with your eyes?

18:11.632 --> 18:15.385
Pink eye. It's very contagious,
I wouldn't be touching me.

18:16.554 --> 18:18.305
I probably won't.

18:19.223 --> 18:23.018
I am looking for a man of the cloth,
sometimes uses this address.

18:23.311 --> 18:25.312
His name is Pastor Israel Fandi.

18:26.689 --> 18:27.856
No. Never heard of him.

18:29.192 --> 18:32.360
He had a church not far from here.
Somebody blew it up.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.654
No, I can't help you.

18:36.699 --> 18:37.908
- And you're sure?
- Yeah, positive.

18:38.034 --> 18:39.993
So I'm gonna get back to my inventory, so...

18:40.161 --> 18:41.703
- Oh! Shit.
- Hey, man!

18:42.079 --> 18:44.331
I thought that was plastic.

18:46.417 --> 18:47.501
Oh, damn.

18:47.585 --> 18:51.713
- Listen, Bunny Rabbit.
- Not from the high end, man. Come on.

18:51.923 --> 18:56.843
I'm trying to incarcerate a very bad man,
and Pastor Fandi may aid me in doing so.

18:56.928 --> 19:00.722
So, unless you want me to continue to be
hilariously clumsy in your store,

19:01.098 --> 19:03.433
why don't you tell me where he is?

19:03.768 --> 19:06.228
All right, look, I haven't seen him in months.

19:06.354 --> 19:10.106
After they blew up the church.
Look. He got paranoid, man. He took off.

19:10.233 --> 19:11.858
- Hey...
- Where is he?

19:11.943 --> 19:16.154
One of the deacons, from his old church?
He does yard work for my grandma.

19:16.239 --> 19:19.324
- So you should go talk to him, man. No.
- Oh, my God.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.077
299 Tibbs.

19:23.412 --> 19:25.413
Mrs. Davis, all right?

19:26.749 --> 19:29.960
- 299 Tibbs, Mrs. Davis.
- Yeah.

19:30.920 --> 19:35.048
Okay. I broke it, I bought it.
Take care of those eyes.

19:36.592 --> 19:38.260
"Landscaping," they call it.

19:39.595 --> 19:42.764
In my day, we called it "cutting the grass."

19:43.140 --> 19:46.268
Ma'am, I need to talk to
the men who cut your grass.

19:46.477 --> 19:50.230
Why don't you check down the block?
See, he cut my house for free.

19:50.314 --> 19:54.192
Yeah, hoping that the other neighbors
would admire his work and hire him.

19:54.277 --> 19:55.569
And they did, too!

19:55.653 --> 19:58.613
- They didn't charge you?
- Not one single dime.

20:00.616 --> 20:02.617
Don't you tell my neighbors, though.

20:02.743 --> 20:06.496
Especially that one over there,
across the street, Linda.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.957
Oh, she's a bitch on wheels.

20:10.293 --> 20:12.961
- Are you starting a vegetable garden?
- I don't know.

20:13.296 --> 20:16.506
I don't get back here very much,
with this hip.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.509
But he said they keep taking out weeds.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.970
Would you mind telling me
if you recognize this gentleman?

20:22.513 --> 20:23.680
Looks like Otis.

20:23.806 --> 20:25.682
- Otis?
- The landscaping fella.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.809
And do you know where I could find him?

20:27.977 --> 20:31.187
Right here, tomorrow afternoon. Come on.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.651
His last-known residence was Wichita.

20:39.322 --> 20:42.991
- And where have you been?
- Personal business.

20:45.661 --> 20:48.246
That's why they call it "personal".

20:50.166 --> 20:53.376
You... You got that top ten list
for the Judge for me?

20:53.502 --> 20:56.504
I do. And it wasn't easy
narrowing it down to 10.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.340
They don't call him "Mike the Hammer"
for nothing.

20:58.424 --> 20:59.799
Every time that gavel drops,

20:59.884 --> 21:01.843
he just hits them with
the maximum sentence,

21:01.928 --> 21:06.139
plus asset forfeiture, court costs...
Everything he can throw at them.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.600
Well, as advertised, he's colorful.
Loves his job.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.644
No, this is something more.

21:10.728 --> 21:14.314
I got out the old court records going all
the way back to his first days on the bench.

21:14.398 --> 21:17.192
And that's when I find Kit McKendrie.

21:18.694 --> 21:22.906
- Kit McKendrie trying to kill the Judge?
- No, Mr. McKendrie got off with time served.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.408
And therein lies a tale.

21:26.744 --> 21:31.206
Yeah, Raylan, there's the Melanie twins,
right there. Those are my favorite.

21:31.874 --> 21:34.918
- Hey, Donna. Good to see you. Hey, Becka.
- Hi!

21:35.044 --> 21:37.921
Have a sit right here. Enjoy the view.

21:39.548 --> 21:40.757
Judge?

21:41.384 --> 21:44.636
Well, hey, darling.
Hey, thanks again for saving my life.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.096
You know what everyone's calling me now.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.806
- What?
- Snake charmer.

21:47.890 --> 21:49.724
Well, they don't know how right they are.

21:51.102 --> 21:53.186
I know what he's having. What'll you have?

21:53.270 --> 21:56.731
He'll have what I'm having,
or he won't have anything at all.

21:57.984 --> 22:00.777
- And a water?
- Yeah.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.907
She's giving you the eye! Did you see it?

22:06.617 --> 22:08.243
Yeah, you got my permission, by the way.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.247
Hey, I was at the office earlier.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.958
One of the other deputies
was reviewing your cases.

22:15.084 --> 22:16.835
He found one that was curious.

22:16.919 --> 22:19.838
A fella name of Kit McKendrie.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.132
McKendrie. Yeah.

22:22.425 --> 22:23.508
You remember him?

22:23.592 --> 22:26.803
I remember his face,
his greasy hair, stained teeth.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.514
- Well, what was the deal there?
- Did you read about the case?

22:29.598 --> 22:31.433
Just the bare bones.

22:32.435 --> 22:38.106
Thanks, darling. Yeah, I had him in my court,
before I got to federal. First-time offender.

22:38.441 --> 22:42.027
Everything in me said that boy was evil.

22:42.695 --> 22:45.530
He had a daddy
used to stub butts out on his arm.

22:45.614 --> 22:48.283
Swear to Christ, there were cigarette burns
all the way up to his shoulder.

22:48.367 --> 22:54.581
So, I pushed down what my gut said,
I give him a cream-puff 18 months,

22:54.665 --> 22:56.124
banged it down to time served.

22:56.208 --> 23:00.503
About a year later,
McKendrie shot a six-year-old.

23:01.505 --> 23:04.424
And the state trooper who come to get him.

23:04.508 --> 23:07.135
I looked into his eyes,
and I knew he was no good,

23:07.344 --> 23:10.513
but I let my feelings interfere. Never again.

23:14.185 --> 23:16.770
Well, you worried about Boyd Crowder
out in the world?

23:16.854 --> 23:18.313
Well, I have my concerns.

23:18.814 --> 23:22.484
- You gonna do something about it?
- I was told not to go near him.

23:22.568 --> 23:24.152
But you are, aren't you?

23:25.988 --> 23:27.614
Going out to the American Gulag.

23:27.698 --> 23:31.576
Hell, they try to civilize everything,
down to cowboy titty bars.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.204
Your Honor.
Just one minute, before you go.

23:46.383 --> 23:48.176
- Hey, man, what's your deal?
- Turn around.

23:48.594 --> 23:51.763
- Let me get a good look at you.
- Take a walk, Tinker Bell. It ain't like that.

23:51.847 --> 23:53.723
Well, what's it like?

23:54.517 --> 23:56.601
- Do I know you?
- Doesn't matter, does it?

23:56.769 --> 23:58.561
Well, if I got a beef with you,
I'd like to know about it.

23:58.687 --> 24:00.105
Deputy US Marshal.

24:00.523 --> 24:02.357
Now, I'm gonna pat you down.
I need your arms up.

24:03.067 --> 24:04.526
Okay, good.

24:06.904 --> 24:09.531
That tickles, Uncle Billy.
I don't think I like that game.

24:10.741 --> 24:13.701
Your Honor, ring any bells?

24:15.287 --> 24:18.873
Hell, I don't know. See so many of them.

24:19.416 --> 24:24.671
- What's your name, sport?
- Me? George Jefferson.

24:24.755 --> 24:27.215
- Got any I. D., George?
- You know what? I don't.

24:27.299 --> 24:28.466
Imagine that.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.969
Well, I don't know if you're a cop,

24:31.053 --> 24:33.930
or if you're just a homo
pretending to be a cop,

24:34.056 --> 24:38.101
but either way, I'm gonna wash up and go,
unless there's a law against that.

24:38.727 --> 24:41.146
Well, why don't you just tell me
why you're eyeing the old bull

24:41.230 --> 24:42.605
in a bar full of beautiful ladies?

24:42.773 --> 24:44.482
What do you want me to say?
I'm a people person!

24:44.733 --> 24:46.234
- People person?
- That's right.

24:46.735 --> 24:50.446
Look, I've never seen
that old geezer in my life.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.283
So if you don't mind, I got a bus to catch.

24:53.409 --> 24:56.244
No, no, no.
That's not the way this works.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.414
The way this works is I go, you stay.

25:02.084 --> 25:03.626
Count to 100.

25:12.428 --> 25:14.012
Ready for more?

25:15.431 --> 25:17.849
That's him. That's the one I saw.

25:18.267 --> 25:21.769
I am taking you downtown!
Your old man's still got some moves.

25:23.105 --> 25:24.230
Come on, Jake, you're not even trying.

25:24.315 --> 25:26.608
Jake, come on! Throw up some D.
Let's go!

25:26.984 --> 25:29.027
I don't like one-on-one.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.654
Look, we're just goofing.
You don't have to be any good.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.948
I didn't say I wasn't good, Virgil.
I said I didn't like it.

25:34.325 --> 25:36.701
Oh, I see. Talking trash, are you?

25:36.785 --> 25:39.120
I see how you do.
Let's see what you got, yo.

25:45.502 --> 25:48.838
- Can we go now?
- Jake, I only get to see you, like...

25:51.133 --> 25:54.135
You're a real little shit, you know that?

25:55.554 --> 25:59.307
Hey, Jake, you want to get a burger?
Burger or something?

26:05.814 --> 26:08.858
- You're early. You already sick of him?
- Of course not.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.361
I wasn't talking to you.

26:14.823 --> 26:16.366
Virgil Corum.

26:16.492 --> 26:19.410
I saw him at the crash site,
then again at the bar the Judge frequents.

26:19.495 --> 26:21.663
I spoke to him,
but I had nothing to hold him.

26:21.747 --> 26:25.208
He got 15 years for possession with
intent from Judge Michael Reardon.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.001
Did he even make your top ten list?

26:27.086 --> 26:28.503
He wasn't even in the top 50.

26:28.587 --> 26:31.506
He was released five weeks ago
after serving eight.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.676
Before his bust, he was in animal control,
which could explain the snake.

26:35.052 --> 26:37.178
Well, make sure everybody on the detail
has his picture.

26:37.721 --> 26:39.305
How's his address?

26:39.390 --> 26:41.849
It's a halfway house,
and they haven't seen him for a while.

26:42.101 --> 26:45.853
They say he go visits his kid.
I got a phone number for his ex-wife.

26:45.938 --> 26:47.188
Well, let's find him and talk to him.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.612
Hey, you get an address for Virgil's ex,
you give me a call?

26:54.697 --> 26:56.698
Something I got to take care of.

26:57.533 --> 27:00.076
Hey! Pastor Fandi!

27:01.745 --> 27:03.454
You got the wrong guy, my man.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.874
No, I don't think so.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.877
Right back. Let's walk.

27:10.379 --> 27:11.546
Okay.

27:14.550 --> 27:16.259
So, you remember me?

27:16.385 --> 27:18.636
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
You went to a Peter Tosh concert once.

27:18.721 --> 27:19.887
What do you want?

27:20.556 --> 27:22.890
Boyd Crowder.
Guy who blew up your church?

27:22.975 --> 27:24.434
- Yeah.
- Just got out of prison.

27:24.935 --> 27:27.937
- So what's that got to do with me?
- Your testimony could put him back in.

27:29.064 --> 27:31.899
- How'd he get out of jail so soon?
- Well, there was a problem with his case.

27:31.984 --> 27:33.276
What, some lawyer forgets to dot an "I",

27:33.402 --> 27:34.819
all of a sudden,
I'm dragged back in this shit?

27:34.903 --> 27:37.613
I'm just asking you to do what you
should have done three months ago.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.907
- Make me.
- I'm sorry?

27:40.075 --> 27:41.367
You want me to testify, make me.

27:41.452 --> 27:44.287
And he does something like that again,
this time someone gets hurt,

27:44.496 --> 27:46.581
you could have stopped it and didn't,
that doesn't bother you?

27:46.749 --> 27:49.417
Why don't you ask the guy who screwed up
if it bothers him?

27:51.128 --> 27:52.587
Oh, shit.

27:53.255 --> 27:56.257
It was you.
Oh, this is sweet.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.509
Good luck. I got to go mow.

28:00.763 --> 28:02.263
What you gonna do?
You gonna put a gun to my head?

28:02.431 --> 28:05.183
You gonna shoot me if I don't testify?

28:10.522 --> 28:11.939
Yeah, Tim, what do you want?

28:12.274 --> 28:13.649
You seen Virgil recently?

28:13.776 --> 28:16.027
About a half an hour ago,
when he brought Jake back.

28:16.153 --> 28:18.613
- Do you know where he might be now?
- I ain't got the faintest idea.

28:18.697 --> 28:20.448
Does Jake?

28:20.824 --> 28:24.619
Jake!

28:25.454 --> 28:28.664
- What?
- Come here! And don't you yell at me!

28:28.791 --> 28:30.958
- You yelled at me!
- Just get over here.

28:31.627 --> 28:35.630
Did Virgil say where he's going
or what he's doing or where he's staying?

28:35.798 --> 28:37.298
No.

28:38.300 --> 28:40.676
Well, that's all you got there.

28:41.136 --> 28:46.516
Ma'am, your ex-husband is a possible
suspect in a threat against a federal judge.

28:46.683 --> 28:49.727
Reardon?
The one who put him away?

28:49.812 --> 28:55.566
I hope Virgil will kill that son of a bitch.
Probably not supposed to say that, am I?

28:56.360 --> 28:59.904
Any letters he might have sent
that have a return address on them?

29:00.155 --> 29:02.740
There was something,
came earlier this week.

29:02.825 --> 29:06.202
Not from him, you know, but on his behalf.

29:07.704 --> 29:10.331
You want me to see
if I can find that for you?

29:10.666 --> 29:11.999
All right.

29:12.876 --> 29:16.504
Okay, so, why him more than any other?
What's his sob story?

29:16.588 --> 29:19.340
I think with him it's more about his family.

29:19.550 --> 29:22.468
Wife and kid still trying to
crawl out from under the rubble.

29:22.553 --> 29:27.014
You know,
I bet if I met Mr. Virgil Corum at a bar,

29:27.850 --> 29:30.435
sat next to him on an airplane
and heard his story,

29:30.519 --> 29:33.521
I would feel his pain, and I would care.

29:33.605 --> 29:36.357
But as a judge, it's not my job to care.

29:36.567 --> 29:40.027
You care about Tommy Bucks?
Maybe he had a son.

29:40.112 --> 29:43.322
Doesn't know him as a stone killer,
only knows him as "Dad."

29:43.407 --> 29:45.032
- Would you care?
- Would I care?

29:45.117 --> 29:50.455
Would it have changed what you did?
No, sir. Well, at least I hope not.

29:52.040 --> 29:55.626
You made the call, you did what you had to.
No regrets.

30:02.968 --> 30:04.218
The gun went off, too.

30:04.720 --> 30:06.971
See how he holds that thing?

30:08.807 --> 30:10.516
- What the hell?
- What happened?

30:10.601 --> 30:12.977
You top off that generator like I told you?

30:13.061 --> 30:15.146
- Yeah, I did!
- Give me that thing.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.065
- Evening, bitches!
- What the hell?

30:18.400 --> 30:21.527
Easy, easy. Put it down. Put it down.
You want to lose that hand?

30:21.612 --> 30:24.238
- Come on.
- Come on with me. Let's go.

30:24.740 --> 30:26.115
Stupid...

30:27.618 --> 30:31.204
Let it not be said that I did not give you
an opportunity to amend your ways.

30:31.288 --> 30:32.580
Got the money.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.126
What are you doing?

30:37.252 --> 30:40.338
- God, no. No, no, don't!
- Shut up.

30:42.299 --> 30:46.052
No, no! You son of a bitch!
God damn you!

30:46.136 --> 30:48.012
Fire in the hole.

30:58.649 --> 31:01.108
Oh, you bastard.
Gil was in the back.

31:02.611 --> 31:04.111
You killed him.

31:04.321 --> 31:05.446
You killed Gil.

31:25.342 --> 31:27.843
Come here. Come on.

31:41.149 --> 31:44.235
You know what? I got to piss. Yeah.

31:47.990 --> 31:50.157
Let me just clear it first.

32:00.586 --> 32:04.630
Sorry, sir. US Marshals.
You just finish your business.

32:04.715 --> 32:06.007
Asshole.

32:20.522 --> 32:21.522
I do. I get it.

32:21.732 --> 32:26.360
Hey, don't move! Swear to God,
you make another move, I shoot the Judge!

32:27.529 --> 32:29.530
Can we agree the young lady can go?

32:30.532 --> 32:34.076
No. I think she ought to know
the kind of dick she's sucking.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.746
- Mr. Corum...
- No, I am talking to the Judge,

32:36.872 --> 32:40.916
and the only thing I want from him
is the one thing I couldn't get before...

32:41.126 --> 32:43.544
- His attention!
- Well, I think you got it.

32:43.629 --> 32:45.338
Yeah, I had to put a goddamn gun
to his head, didn't I?

32:45.422 --> 32:47.590
- Virgil...
- No, Marshal, this is my courtroom,

32:47.716 --> 32:49.425
and you are overruled.
I'll deal with you later.

32:49.551 --> 32:50.593
You're part of this.

32:50.719 --> 32:51.761
- Me?
- Yeah!

32:51.928 --> 32:53.721
Marshals come in,
they took everything from me!

32:54.056 --> 32:55.139
Shit! Shit!

32:56.767 --> 32:58.893
Virgil, turn around!
Show me your hands!

32:58.977 --> 33:00.895
Now, don't you move.

33:01.271 --> 33:02.980
You didn't even recognize me.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.358
- What?
- Five feet away in that bathroom,

33:05.442 --> 33:07.818
and you had no idea who I was.

33:07.903 --> 33:10.946
I was just another faceless shitbird
to come through your courtroom.

33:11.073 --> 33:12.114
Ain't that about right?

33:12.240 --> 33:14.492
Virgil, could you shut up a minute?
Just need to make a phone call.

33:14.576 --> 33:17.161
- 911. What's your emergency?
- US Marshal Raylan Givens.

33:17.245 --> 33:20.706
I'm in the alley outside the
Cowboy Palace Saloon out on Airport Road.

33:20.791 --> 33:24.960
Shots fired, one man shot.
I need an ambulance and the usual.

33:25.087 --> 33:26.170
Okay, go on.

33:26.254 --> 33:30.800
Yeah, I'm a shitbird. I did the crime,
I did the time, I paid the consequences!

33:30.926 --> 33:32.718
Virgil, show me your hands.
Keep them up.

33:32.803 --> 33:34.720
Yeah! Have you ever
paid the consequences, Judge?

33:34.805 --> 33:36.013
I got to listen to this shit?
Are you kidding me?

33:36.098 --> 33:39.392
- Put a bullet in him, it's the least you can do.
- Why do you got to go after my family?

33:39.476 --> 33:40.601
They're already riding that poverty line.

33:40.686 --> 33:42.812
Why the hell you think
I was growing that marijuana?

33:42.938 --> 33:44.814
Back inside! Get back.

33:45.482 --> 33:50.152
My wife's only crime was trusting
the wrong man to be her husband.

33:54.157 --> 33:55.449
Virgil?

33:55.617 --> 33:57.118
- Are you done?
- I'm getting woozy.

33:57.661 --> 33:59.704
All right.
But you're not gonna die.

34:00.288 --> 34:04.333
And, hell, hey, if you do,
you took out life insurance, didn't you?

34:04.835 --> 34:07.253
Yeah, I saw that at your ex-wife's place.

34:07.337 --> 34:10.464
Was that the plan?
Shoot the Judge, make me kill you?

34:10.841 --> 34:12.967
I thought you guys shoot people all the time.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.678
Not all the time.
And never lightly.

34:16.138 --> 34:18.639
But you didn't think of those consequences,
did you?

34:19.056 --> 34:20.683
Jesus Christ.

34:22.060 --> 34:25.521
- You all right?
- Yeah. Sure.

34:27.232 --> 34:30.525
Look, why didn't you just shoot him
the second you saw him?

34:30.652 --> 34:32.152
That's why I picked you.

34:33.155 --> 34:36.741
Your Honor, if I thought I had
to shoot him, I would have.

34:41.204 --> 34:43.664
- Thanks.
- For what?

34:46.251 --> 34:49.587
If you hadn't stopped me,
I would have killed him.

34:54.009 --> 34:57.678
- I brought breakfast.
- You brought diabetes.

34:57.763 --> 35:01.891
- What the hell happened to your face?
- Oh, I slipped and fell.

35:02.017 --> 35:05.102
Oh, if I had a dime every time
I used that excuse.

35:05.854 --> 35:09.231
Called you here
to talk about your legal situation.

35:09.441 --> 35:12.485
- What about it?
- I was on a protection duty this week

35:12.569 --> 35:16.864
for this judge and told him about the threats
you were getting from the Crowders.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.866
He said he'd talk to your judge
down in Harlan

35:18.950 --> 35:20.534
and get the terms
of your probation adjusted.

35:20.786 --> 35:23.287
- Adjusted how?
- So you can get out of Kentucky.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.247
- Where would I go?
- I don't know.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.876
Ava, don't you got a list somewhere?
Miami, Costa Rica?

35:28.960 --> 35:31.295
Costa Rica, huh?
How far away you want me?

35:31.713 --> 35:33.964
- It's not about that.
- No?

35:34.049 --> 35:36.217
- It's about keeping you safe.
- I thought you were doing that.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.594
Well, I don't know if you've noticed,
but I haven't done it the last couple weeks.

35:38.804 --> 35:40.554
I can't be watching your back anymore.

35:40.639 --> 35:42.306
Or any part of me, huh?

35:45.727 --> 35:47.102
Can you...

35:51.233 --> 35:53.108
Or the bed. Fine.

36:01.076 --> 36:03.244
Boyd's out because of me.

36:03.370 --> 36:05.371
- Because of us.
- Because of us screwing.

36:05.622 --> 36:07.414
Because of us screwing.

36:07.541 --> 36:08.624
And I don't want to be with you

36:08.750 --> 36:11.418
when I get that call
that he's hurt someone, or worse.

36:11.545 --> 36:12.962
And you don't want it, either.

36:13.088 --> 36:17.591
Didn't the District Attorney order you
to stay the hell away from Boyd?

36:18.426 --> 36:20.386
Yeah. But that was more of a suggestion.

36:20.470 --> 36:23.472
And not seeing me,
it was just a suggestion, too.

36:23.598 --> 36:26.767
But you're willing to ignore it for Boyd
and not me.

36:26.893 --> 36:31.397
You'll walk away from
whatever it was that we had to what?

36:31.481 --> 36:34.191
To try and catch Boyd
run a red light or something?

36:34.276 --> 36:35.985
If that's all I thought he was gonna do...

36:36.111 --> 36:40.072
Maybe it is! Did you ever think that
maybe Boyd really has changed?

36:40.156 --> 36:42.825
I mean, maybe he's just trying to
start his life over.

36:42.951 --> 36:44.285
People change.

36:45.120 --> 36:46.787
Yeah, like Bowman.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.790
- Well, Boyd ain't Bowman.
- No, he's worse.

37:01.428 --> 37:05.764
You know, the night I saw you at my door,

37:06.975 --> 37:12.021
I thought God had given me another chance.

37:13.273 --> 37:15.149
Like a pinball reset.

37:17.152 --> 37:22.323
Same as you staying in Harlan all along,
making your move when I turned 18.

37:23.033 --> 37:25.993
Like none of the rest of it ever happened.

37:27.996 --> 37:31.999
I drink enough, I start to believe it, too.

37:44.346 --> 37:47.222
Come in.
Get that door.

37:47.974 --> 37:49.183
Am I in trouble?

37:55.023 --> 37:59.485
Last night, a meth lab blew up in the woods
outside of Harlan.

38:00.153 --> 38:03.364
And the state police there had a CI inside.

38:03.531 --> 38:05.157
He was killed.

38:05.533 --> 38:07.618
And the last report he filed

38:07.702 --> 38:11.246
said that Boyd Crowder
had threatened to blow the meth lab up

38:11.373 --> 38:12.581
if they didn't shut it down.

38:17.879 --> 38:20.047
So now he's killed someone.

38:26.513 --> 38:27.888
Oh, Christ.

38:28.390 --> 38:31.558
Meth labs have been known
to blow up for other reasons, Raylan.

38:32.602 --> 38:36.814
State police have been watching Boyd
and Bo since their release,

38:36.898 --> 38:39.191
and they think that Boyd
is probably trying to send

38:39.275 --> 38:41.944
some kind of a message
on behalf of his father.

38:42.195 --> 38:46.782
Probably trying to bring his old criminal
enterprises back under his protection.

38:47.367 --> 38:50.536
Boyd told me
he wasn't gonna rob banks anymore.

38:51.621 --> 38:54.248
- So you've been to see Boyd.
- Yeah.

38:57.252 --> 39:01.422
Even though your friend David Vasquez
expressly told you not to.

39:03.091 --> 39:05.175
- Did you get anything?
- I spoke to his men.

39:05.260 --> 39:10.264
Told them whoever came forward first,
we were offering a $50,000 reward.

39:10.473 --> 39:12.433
- That's a good move.
- Hasn't worked.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.144
It's not over yet. It's still a good move.

39:15.270 --> 39:18.939
I also talked to his boy, Devil, Dewey.

39:19.607 --> 39:22.735
Found Fandi,
tried to get him to man up and testify.

39:22.819 --> 39:25.612
- No go?
- No. No go.

39:26.740 --> 39:30.451
Well, you could just quit.

39:33.288 --> 39:34.788
I could try again.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.165
I'll take care of Vasquez,

39:36.332 --> 39:39.960
and I'll call the staties
and see if they can help us in any way.

39:51.347 --> 39:52.514
Otis.

39:52.849 --> 39:54.224
What the hell are you doing here?

39:54.309 --> 39:55.893
Last time I asked you to testify,

39:55.977 --> 39:58.270
you said, "Make me."
So I'm here to make you.

39:58.980 --> 40:02.941
You know, I've been talking to some of your
other "landscaping" customers.

40:03.026 --> 40:04.943
- So?
- Well, they're all old people,

40:05.028 --> 40:07.404
with big backyards
that they can barely get out to.

40:07.489 --> 40:11.075
- Is this leading to a point anytime soon?
- You're planting weed in their backyards.

40:11.159 --> 40:13.035
- Is that what they told you?
- No, what they did is

40:13.161 --> 40:15.204
they showed me where you'd been
cutting back the weeds,

40:15.330 --> 40:17.581
- like you did here?
- Just like they paid me to.

40:17.665 --> 40:22.294
That's the first time I saw weeds
planted in a row with irrigation.

40:22.712 --> 40:27.424
Now, the way I figure it, you got about
300, 400 pounds drying on racks somewhere.

40:27.509 --> 40:28.634
We can get a warrant,

40:28.718 --> 40:33.722
search your basement and your garage,
or you can do your civic duty.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.849
What, are you just so driven
to get him back in?

40:35.975 --> 40:37.893
So you can restore balance to the Force?

40:39.813 --> 40:43.107
I'm driven because he's murdered
at least two people that I know of!

40:43.191 --> 40:44.399
You think you're scared of him?

40:44.734 --> 40:46.902
You got no idea
what you can expect from me.

40:47.028 --> 40:49.238
All right, all right! I'll identify him!

40:51.324 --> 40:52.407
Thank you.

40:52.867 --> 40:55.327
Yeah, show me his picture
so I know what he looks like.

40:55.411 --> 40:57.329
What are you talking about?

40:57.413 --> 40:59.456
I need to know what he looks like
so I can identify him.

40:59.541 --> 41:01.542
- You didn't see him?
- No.

41:01.709 --> 41:04.044
You think I didn't identify him
because I was afraid?

41:04.170 --> 41:05.379
Weren't you?

41:05.547 --> 41:08.632
No, it was night. He was 100 feet away.

41:08.716 --> 41:11.718
You were all nervous
and jittery outside the I. D. Room.

41:11.886 --> 41:15.597
I'm a pot grower
in the middle of a shitload of police!

41:15.723 --> 41:19.351
I mean, just show me what he looks like,
I'll say whatever it is you want me to say.

41:19.435 --> 41:20.978
I mean, you're saying he's killing people.

41:21.062 --> 41:22.729
- Otis, shut up.
- Right? Will you do that?

41:23.606 --> 41:25.774
- What?
- I'm not that guy.

41:26.901 --> 41:30.529
Why don't you try real gardening?
You actually seem pretty good at it.

41:31.072 --> 41:32.948
How you gonna get him?

41:35.076 --> 41:39.621
I don't know.
