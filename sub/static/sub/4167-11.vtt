WEBVTT

00:02.077 --> 00:04.163
<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

00:04.246 --> 00:09.043
Is it true that once a white woman's
been with a carpenter she never goes back?

00:09.126 --> 00:12.129
Life insurance cheque
made out to Nancy Scottson.

00:12.213 --> 00:15.925
- Shouldn't be any trouble to cash.
- Oh, look at that.

00:16.008 --> 00:18.802
- I think you owe me some money.
- How much?

00:18.886 --> 00:20.804
119,000.

00:20.888 --> 00:24.225
And I need $100,000.
Majestic is checking their books tomorrow.

00:24.308 --> 00:26.185
I might have access to some money.

00:26.268 --> 00:28.729
I had a little emergency.
You're going to have it back in a month.

00:28.812 --> 00:29.980
This is a scam, right?

00:30.064 --> 00:33.150
This is my little way of saying,
"Thank you for all your help. "

00:33.234 --> 00:34.610
I look so happy.

00:39.156 --> 00:40.491
Oh!

00:42.243 --> 00:44.828
We're looking down
a long road here, Mrs Hodes.

00:44.870 --> 00:47.790
Not me. We are getting a divorce.

00:47.873 --> 00:49.625
There's no one else but you.

00:51.335 --> 00:52.795
Oh, God.

00:52.878 --> 00:54.296
- I quit.
- Bullshit.

00:54.380 --> 00:56.632
Yeah, I'm bad. Punish me.

01:12.731 --> 01:15.734
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:15.818 --> 01:18.779
<i># Little boxes made of ticky-tacky</i>

01:18.862 --> 01:21.365
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:21.448 --> 01:23.951
<i># Little boxes all the same</i>

01:24.034 --> 01:26.787
<i># There's a green one and a pink one</i>

01:26.871 --> 01:29.540
<i># And a blue one and a yellow one</i>

01:29.665 --> 01:32.167
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

01:32.251 --> 01:34.920
<i># And they all look just the same</i>

01:35.004 --> 01:37.882
<i># And the people in the houses</i>

01:38.007 --> 01:40.259
<i># All went to the university</i>

01:40.342 --> 01:43.178
<i># Where they were all put into boxes</i>

01:43.262 --> 01:45.806
<i># And they all came out the same</i>

01:45.890 --> 01:48.642
<i># And there's doctors and lawyers</i>

01:48.726 --> 01:51.312
<i># And there's business executives</i>

01:51.395 --> 01:53.772
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

01:53.856 --> 01:58.193
<i># And they all look just the same #</i>

02:01.530 --> 02:04.116
How could you leave all this?

02:04.200 --> 02:08.454
A better, more lucrative opportunity
has presented itself.

02:08.537 --> 02:10.622
Besides, we both know you'll soon be off

02:10.705 --> 02:13.876
to build another just-add-water insta-town.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.669
Utopian village, Nancy.

02:16.337 --> 02:20.424
- Where are you going?
- A company called Aguatecture.

02:21.050 --> 02:23.302
- Mm.
- It's all good.

02:23.385 --> 02:26.597
Well, would you give me a few
days to find someone new

02:26.680 --> 02:28.474
and maybe fuck you a few more times?

02:28.557 --> 02:30.935
Yes, and maybe.

02:33.562 --> 02:35.898
Just let yourself in.

02:35.981 --> 02:36.982
Hi.

02:38.150 --> 02:39.193
Is your mom around?

02:39.276 --> 02:41.320
I'm starting to think you
just like me for my mother.

02:41.403 --> 02:42.488
Excuse me?

02:42.571 --> 02:45.658
Who's the one that's been
living in a grow house?

02:45.783 --> 02:48.786
Makes a girl feel like she can't get any attention

02:48.911 --> 02:50.496
unless she's a pot plant.

02:50.579 --> 02:52.706
- How about we take a trip upstairs...
- Mm-hm.

02:52.790 --> 02:55.584
...and I check your bud and your stems...

02:57.753 --> 03:00.130
Oh... sorry. I have to go.

03:00.214 --> 03:02.216
Hey, well, hold on a sec.

03:02.299 --> 03:04.802
- Who's the honker?
- Kenneth.

03:04.885 --> 03:07.221
We're gonna go see
Laser Bike at the Greek.

03:08.472 --> 03:10.099
You're going on a date?

03:10.140 --> 03:11.725
Yes, and now I'm late.

03:13.185 --> 03:15.271
I thought you were dating me.

03:15.354 --> 03:16.647
I am.

03:17.439 --> 03:20.693
- You can't date both of us.
- It's not like that with Kenneth, OK?

03:20.776 --> 03:23.028
He meets my cultural needs,

03:23.112 --> 03:27.283
and you engage my sensual, sexual side.

03:27.366 --> 03:29.577
So I'm just something
for you to rub up against?

03:29.660 --> 03:30.953
Silas, don't do this.

03:32.121 --> 03:34.373
I have to go. I'll see you tomorrow.

03:34.456 --> 03:36.083
We'll dialogue.

03:50.055 --> 03:51.974
Oh, shit. You.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.977
Me, carrying cash.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.979
See? Have a little faith.

03:57.062 --> 03:59.440
That looks awfully thin for 100 grand.

03:59.523 --> 04:02.026
I'm doing the best I can.

04:02.735 --> 04:04.153
"Little faith. "

04:04.236 --> 04:06.697
That's exactly what I've got for you.

04:12.203 --> 04:14.580
This is how fucking broke I am.

04:21.545 --> 04:25.758
He was dirty. So was his partner.
They took money whenever they could.

04:25.883 --> 04:28.135
I know. I lived with the creep for a decade.

04:29.678 --> 04:32.806
He hid it somewhere.
Believe me, it's out there.

04:32.890 --> 04:35.768
And the legit stuff,
the life insurance, the pension -

04:35.851 --> 04:37.186
wife two's got it.

04:37.353 --> 04:39.772
And she put in, what,
six months with the bastard?

04:39.855 --> 04:41.649
I'm raising his child

04:41.732 --> 04:43.734
and I'm begging her for money?

04:43.817 --> 04:45.194
Na-ah, I don't think so.

04:45.277 --> 04:47.529
That's my goddamn fuckin' money.

04:48.155 --> 04:51.242
And I'm telling you, she played him. I know it.

04:51.325 --> 04:54.537
What, suddenly he gets married
and then winds up dead?

04:54.620 --> 04:57.373
Does that make sense to you?

04:57.456 --> 04:59.416
That bitch knows something.

05:01.085 --> 05:02.461
I'll need a retainer.

05:09.760 --> 05:11.178
I'm on it.

05:11.262 --> 05:14.306
This is bullshit. You can't just toss us aside

05:14.390 --> 05:17.268
like we're regular people.
We're elected officials!

05:17.351 --> 05:18.561
I'm an elected official.

05:18.644 --> 05:21.438
You were elected by a city
that no longer exists.

05:21.522 --> 05:24.149
And coarse language
will not be tolerated here, Mr Wilson.

05:24.275 --> 05:27.278
Fuck you, Carilli.
We have jobs we expect to keep.

05:27.403 --> 05:29.989
We have contracts with the city
we expect to be honoured.

05:30.072 --> 05:31.782
I expect mine to be honoured.

05:31.866 --> 05:34.535
Wilson, if you cannot control
that vile mouth of yours,

05:34.618 --> 05:38.080
- I will have you thrown out of this meeting.
- Oh, don't you get all pious on me.

05:38.163 --> 05:40.332
You promised we'd get absorbed
into the machine,

05:40.416 --> 05:42.293
that I'd get absorbed into the machine here.

05:42.376 --> 05:46.505
And, as citizens of Majestic,
you all have the right to run for office

05:46.589 --> 05:48.966
in the next election, one year from now.

05:49.049 --> 05:51.886
Oh, horseshit!

05:51.969 --> 05:54.972
Any city council with half a brain
has got the system so juiced up

05:55.055 --> 05:57.224
no one new has a prayer of getting elected.

05:57.308 --> 05:59.935
Yeah, I want my landscaping contract back!

06:00.019 --> 06:02.563
Well, I am sorry,
but all the landscaping in Majestic

06:02.646 --> 06:05.733
is handled by the Majestic Ministries
Development Corporation.

06:05.816 --> 06:09.153
Look, if we can't get satisfaction here,
we will get it in the streets.

06:09.236 --> 06:10.821
Yeah!

06:10.905 --> 06:15.159
People! People! There are other ways
that you can serve the fine city of Majestic.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.995
You can volunteer for municipal programs.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.997
Volunteering is for saps.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.459
We expect to feed off the tit
of local government, just like you.

06:23.542 --> 06:25.878
I'm afraid that all your contracts and positions

06:25.961 --> 06:28.672
are now null and void per the referendum.

06:28.756 --> 06:31.008
There is very little more to be said!

06:31.091 --> 06:33.469
Oh, and, Mr Wilson,
this council is not finished

06:33.552 --> 06:36.972
looking into your questionable investment
in Aguatecture.

06:37.056 --> 06:40.351
Don't you bang that gavel at me,
you sanctimonious Jesus-freak!

06:40.434 --> 06:43.270
You know, your long skirt
isn't long enough, lady.

06:43.354 --> 06:47.274
I saw your fat ankles. Calf, right into ankle.

06:47.358 --> 06:51.320
Cankles!

06:51.403 --> 06:52.905
- Cankles!
- That is it!

06:52.988 --> 06:53.989
- Cankles!
- Cankles!

06:54.073 --> 06:56.367
That is it! That is it!
This meeting is adjourned!

06:56.450 --> 06:57.618
Cankle bitch!

06:57.701 --> 06:59.745
- That's right, cankle bitch!
- Cankle bitch!

06:59.828 --> 07:02.081
- How dare you?
- Rude and vulgar!

07:02.164 --> 07:05.376
You, too! Man cankles! Mankles!

07:06.794 --> 07:09.296
Douglas, we need to have a word.

07:09.380 --> 07:10.631
OK, how about "die"?

07:11.215 --> 07:12.925
How about "Aguatecture"?

07:13.008 --> 07:15.803
How about "none of your business"?

07:17.346 --> 07:19.431
Hey, how much do you know about it?

07:19.515 --> 07:21.016
Not enough.

07:24.103 --> 07:26.855
Mom, we gotta get rid of Tara.

07:28.107 --> 07:29.108
Really?

07:29.191 --> 07:31.819
She's untrustworthy.

07:31.902 --> 07:33.779
Wow.

07:33.862 --> 07:35.781
Last I counted, she was right on.

07:35.865 --> 07:39.785
And she wraps her money
in those cute little Jesus ribbons.

07:39.869 --> 07:41.120
I'm thinking she's a keeper.

07:41.203 --> 07:44.582
Look, I know you said not to involve Tara.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.417
That's right, I did.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.752
And I know that you were worried

07:48.836 --> 07:50.838
that I would maybe break up with her.

07:51.589 --> 07:54.216
- Let me guess, I was psychic?
- You were right. You were right.

07:54.300 --> 07:57.386
OK, you were right, and I was wrong.
I get it. I got it.

07:57.469 --> 08:01.056
- But we need to get rid of her.
- No, my dear.

08:01.140 --> 08:04.268
You need to suck it up and make nice.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.561
So, that's it?

08:06.604 --> 08:10.983
You're picking her over me?
Why can't you back me up for once?

08:11.108 --> 08:14.653
This is not your mommy talking.
This is your boss.

08:14.737 --> 08:17.531
So, I suggest you listen to me, now.

08:17.615 --> 08:19.617
- What?
- Tara's my top earner.

08:19.700 --> 08:23.329
When you bring in what she brings in,
without getting emotional or fucking up,

08:23.412 --> 08:27.833
you can make demands, but, until then,
keep your head down and learn.

08:27.917 --> 08:29.627
She stays...

08:30.920 --> 08:32.671
and you get over it.

08:33.923 --> 08:35.341
Now...

08:36.592 --> 08:37.635
as your mother...

08:39.678 --> 08:42.806
I'm sorry it's not working
out between the two of you.

08:42.890 --> 08:45.559
I'm sorry if she hurt you. Little bitch.

08:46.185 --> 08:47.937
You're too good for her.

08:50.022 --> 08:52.816
And I love you very much.

08:53.776 --> 08:56.195
And you could use a haircut.

09:02.201 --> 09:03.202
Ahh.

09:03.285 --> 09:06.038
What's with the banging in the morning?

09:06.121 --> 09:08.290
Mom says we need to beef up security.

09:08.374 --> 09:10.668
- That little thing's a camera?
- Cool, huh?

09:10.751 --> 09:13.295
And I can broadcast the image
to any computer in the house.

09:13.379 --> 09:16.340
Hey, could we point one of those next door?

09:16.423 --> 09:19.343
Jordan Klein's home from college
for summer break.

09:19.426 --> 09:21.679
I can't spend all my time
waiting for her to get naked

09:21.762 --> 09:24.473
one window up and three across
from my side of the house.

09:24.557 --> 09:26.308
I got things to do.

09:26.392 --> 09:28.852
Your father was good with tools,

09:28.936 --> 09:31.021
always building things, fixing things.

09:31.105 --> 09:33.941
- I had to go the other way.
- Which way is that?

09:34.024 --> 09:38.070
Destroying things, blowing stuff up.
Pretty good at it, too.

09:38.153 --> 09:42.366
Unfortunately, not much of a market
for that particular skill when you grow up,

09:42.449 --> 09:44.034
unless you're a terrorist.

09:44.118 --> 09:46.996
You could do special effects for movies,

09:47.037 --> 09:50.165
blow tunnels through mountains,
building demolition, mining.

09:50.249 --> 09:54.545
Blowing shit up is not just for terrorists.
Don't let them take that away from you.

09:58.716 --> 10:00.676
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, Sanjay.

10:00.759 --> 10:04.471
Looking mighty, mighty homosexual today.
Way to own it, sister.

10:04.555 --> 10:06.056
My friend Isabelle's a lesbian.

10:06.140 --> 10:09.727
If I bump into her at North Valley
Gay Pasta Night, I'll say, "Hey. "

10:09.810 --> 10:12.980
- Is Nancy home? I need to restock.
- How much you need? I'll hook you up.

10:13.105 --> 10:15.816
I could use about half a pound.

10:16.942 --> 10:18.736
Back in two shakes.

10:22.239 --> 10:24.450
- Is that little thing a camera?
- Yeah.

10:24.575 --> 10:27.411
Aw, it's adorable.

10:27.494 --> 10:31.498
So, you didn't know you liked guys?

10:33.083 --> 10:35.544
Is there something
you'd like to talk about, Shane?

10:35.628 --> 10:37.755
Are you... feeling confused?

10:37.838 --> 10:39.798
No, I always thought you were gay.

10:39.882 --> 10:42.134
OK, good to go.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.428
Thanks.

10:47.389 --> 10:53.020
<i>You have arrived at your destination.
The route guidance is now finished.</i>

10:53.103 --> 10:56.607
Thank you for guiding me
to the fucking post-apocalypse.

10:58.901 --> 11:02.530
Yes, wonderful.
Richest country in the world.

11:02.613 --> 11:06.700
Glad to see you're taking advantage
of the opportunities offered.

11:22.424 --> 11:23.509
Can I help you?

11:24.468 --> 11:27.096
Where's your owner?

11:28.264 --> 11:31.058
I'm sorry. The owner of this place.

11:31.141 --> 11:33.102
Who wants to know?

11:33.185 --> 11:36.564
I would like to speak to someone
who can tell me what goes on here.

11:36.647 --> 11:38.941
What you see is pretty much what you get.

11:39.024 --> 11:44.738
Fountains, shaped like houses.

11:44.864 --> 11:48.158
We got indoor, outdoor, Tudor, Victorian.

11:48.242 --> 11:51.412
Used to have a craftsman split-level,
but we sold out of that.

11:51.495 --> 11:54.415
Just different houses with water
flushing out the windows.

11:54.498 --> 11:56.667
Aguatecture. You're soaking in it.

11:56.750 --> 12:01.547
And I'm to believe that
Aguatecture attracts investors?

12:03.257 --> 12:06.802
Who on Earth would buy
these tacky things?

12:07.845 --> 12:11.724
Look, if you don't want
none of our tacky things,

12:12.391 --> 12:15.394
how about you get the fuck on out?
We closed.

12:16.520 --> 12:18.939
Where's the owner? Is he in back?

12:19.023 --> 12:22.651
- She's right in front of you.
- What's in the back?

12:22.735 --> 12:25.696
Ain't nothing back there
but files and inventory.

12:25.779 --> 12:28.199
That's fine.
Need to use the restroom, anyway.

12:28.282 --> 12:30.993
- Toilet's broke.
- Just gonna wash my hands.

12:31.076 --> 12:33.537
You can dip them in that fountain
on the way out, if you like.

12:36.373 --> 12:37.875
Now, I done asked you nice.

12:38.417 --> 12:41.837
Now, you all alone in a strange place.

12:41.921 --> 12:44.048
Think it through, now, girl.

12:50.679 --> 12:52.306
There you go.

12:54.016 --> 12:56.018
Thank you for your time.

12:58.187 --> 13:01.023
Hey, we all out of the, erm...

13:02.942 --> 13:04.318
Carpenter.

13:08.113 --> 13:09.114
Who?

13:11.659 --> 13:15.371
I'm sorry. You look like somebody I, erm...

13:16.038 --> 13:18.499
I don't know. I've, erm...

13:20.876 --> 13:22.378
Bye.

13:26.257 --> 13:29.969
- OK, who the fuck was that?
- I don't know.

13:30.052 --> 13:32.596
Maybe we should ask Conrad.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.269
Mom, I need to show you something.

13:39.562 --> 13:41.981
Oh, no, Shane, no more tutorials.

13:42.064 --> 13:44.483
It's not a tutorial. It's feed from earlier.

13:45.150 --> 13:47.570
- So?
- It's the pool guy

13:47.653 --> 13:49.738
checking us out twice in one day.

13:50.739 --> 13:53.075
- Is he a cop?
- I don't know.

13:53.659 --> 13:55.035
That would suck.

13:56.245 --> 13:57.246
Yes.

13:57.997 --> 14:00.708
- Yes, it sure would.
- Now look at this.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.420
When was this one taken?

14:05.713 --> 14:07.339
It's the live feed.

14:09.842 --> 14:11.635
It's the same guy.

14:11.719 --> 14:13.804
He's out there right now.

14:24.106 --> 14:25.608
Who are you?

14:26.317 --> 14:30.154
Just surveying the water lines, ma'am.
You haven't had any problems, have you?

14:30.237 --> 14:32.239
You're not surveying the water lines.

14:32.323 --> 14:35.659
And you're not a fucking
pool cleaner, either.

14:35.743 --> 14:36.785
Who the hell are you?

14:43.792 --> 14:46.503
"Private... Investigator. "

14:46.587 --> 14:49.882
You mind if I have that card back?
I'm running kind of low.

14:54.762 --> 14:56.513
What do you want from me?

14:56.597 --> 14:58.224
Let's walk.

15:00.976 --> 15:05.564
My client is interested in finding out
a whole lot about you.

15:06.273 --> 15:07.483
What client?

15:07.566 --> 15:09.526
Not at liberty to divulge that.

15:09.610 --> 15:12.947
But you can tell me that
you're a private investigator.

15:13.030 --> 15:15.074
Yes, I'm comfortable with that.

15:16.867 --> 15:19.411
I'm comfortable because...

15:19.495 --> 15:20.871
I feel...

15:21.830 --> 15:25.000
- you and I can do business together.
- Really?

15:25.084 --> 15:26.627
I have a strong feeling, in fact,

15:26.710 --> 15:29.713
that in exchange for my discretion...

15:29.797 --> 15:33.008
with the police, with my client,
dealing with your illegal activities

15:33.092 --> 15:34.927
vis-á-vis marijuana trafficking,

15:35.010 --> 15:37.930
you might want to give me some money.

15:38.013 --> 15:40.766
I have no idea what you're talking about.

15:40.849 --> 15:43.727
That doesn't matter. I have pictures.
Dealers coming and going.

15:43.811 --> 15:46.981
I even followed one,
the gay Indian kid, on his rounds.

15:47.064 --> 15:50.067
I have cellphone wiretaps.
Some of it's static-ridden,

15:50.150 --> 15:52.736
I guess it's time to invest
in that newer technology,

15:52.820 --> 15:54.780
but you getting the idea?

15:55.406 --> 15:58.534
Isn't that what Pellicano's going to jail for,
illegal wiretaps?

15:58.617 --> 16:01.537
Inadmissible in court, absolutely.

16:01.620 --> 16:03.330
Illegal? Yeah.

16:03.455 --> 16:07.501
But if they were to show up, anonymously,

16:07.626 --> 16:09.545
at the DEA office...

16:10.254 --> 16:13.966
I bet an extensive investigation would ensue.

16:16.760 --> 16:19.263
- How much do you want?
- I'm not greedy.

16:19.346 --> 16:21.181
I work for a living.

16:21.265 --> 16:23.726
- Fifty thou oughta do the trick.
- Fuck me!

16:23.809 --> 16:27.396
Tempting, but... I like blondes with big, fake tits.

16:27.479 --> 16:28.731
I'll have it in cash.

16:31.317 --> 16:32.735
- Ten.
- Fifty.

16:32.818 --> 16:34.445
- Twenty.
- Fifty.

16:34.528 --> 16:36.614
Come on, please?

16:36.697 --> 16:40.201
You can buy plenty of blondes
with big, fake tits for twenty.

16:42.077 --> 16:45.497
OK, since you asked so nice,
tw... th... f...

16:45.581 --> 16:46.582
fifty.

16:46.665 --> 16:48.292
God, you're a real prick.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.377
Mm, I know.

16:50.461 --> 16:53.464
You and my wife would totally bond on that.

16:55.382 --> 16:58.052
So, any-who,
here's what you're gonna do.

16:58.928 --> 17:01.680
Meet me here, tomorrow morning,

17:01.764 --> 17:03.057
at ten

17:03.140 --> 17:05.017
with the moolah.

17:05.099 --> 17:07.978
Look, it's gonna take me
a little more time than 24 hours

17:08.103 --> 17:09.855
to come up with that much money.

17:09.939 --> 17:13.317
- You're a drug dealer.
- With expenses.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.528
Consider this one of them.

17:16.819 --> 17:18.821
Hasta la tomorra!

17:19.573 --> 17:21.867
Son of a bitch.

17:24.494 --> 17:27.455
Ohh, look who's here, my family.

17:28.207 --> 17:31.210
Hey, family. Did you know that we're poor?

17:31.961 --> 17:34.213
We're really... poor.

17:34.296 --> 17:36.549
Maybe we should cut down
on our liquor purchases.

17:36.632 --> 17:39.843
Oh, no. All the poor drink.

17:39.927 --> 17:44.431
Yeah, I saw the poor this morning.
They all had bottles in paper bags.

17:45.140 --> 17:49.353
- That's what I need, a paper bag.
- Wonderful idea.

17:49.436 --> 17:53.107
You could put your bottle in it,
and then vomit in it when you're done.

17:53.190 --> 17:55.234
I don't vomit from drinking.

17:55.943 --> 17:59.071
I vomit when I think about my life.

17:59.905 --> 18:01.991
Isabelle, why don't you go for another walk?

18:02.074 --> 18:05.202
See? I'm not the only one
who thinks she needs more exercise.

18:05.286 --> 18:08.581
- I don't think you should be alone with her.
- It's OK, honey.

18:08.664 --> 18:10.875
Why don't you go
to Shane's house or something, OK?

18:10.958 --> 18:12.877
Fine. I'll call in later.

18:12.960 --> 18:14.587
Shane's house.

18:14.670 --> 18:15.963
Ha!

18:16.046 --> 18:18.757
I will rock the House of Shane
before I'm done.

18:20.259 --> 18:22.261
Make some coffee, Celia.

18:22.344 --> 18:23.762
Ohh.

18:23.846 --> 18:26.432
Not so fast, roller-boy.

18:27.516 --> 18:29.393
Aguatecture.

18:31.270 --> 18:34.356
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Aguatecture.

18:34.440 --> 18:36.901
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Fine.

18:36.984 --> 18:39.236
And even if I did, I wouldn't tell you.

18:40.362 --> 18:41.614
What the fuck? Wh...

18:42.489 --> 18:44.658
Tell me everything.

18:44.742 --> 18:45.910
You're insane.

18:45.993 --> 18:49.205
Yes, I am fucking insane.

18:50.831 --> 18:51.874
Tell me everything.

18:51.957 --> 18:54.210
Ow! God da...

18:54.752 --> 18:57.296
God damn it!

18:57.379 --> 19:00.591
Up until this point,
I have avoided your nuts,

19:00.716 --> 19:05.262
because God knows what is inside
that fucking diaper of yours.

19:05.346 --> 19:08.390
But so help me, if you don't come clean,

19:08.474 --> 19:13.604
I will make sure a catheter
is a permanent part of your anatomy.

19:16.982 --> 19:19.235
- Bitch.
- Perhaps.

19:21.654 --> 19:23.697
Oh, God! Ow!

19:23.781 --> 19:25.115
Aagh! God!

19:25.199 --> 19:28.744
- Talk to me.
- Fuck... you!

19:28.869 --> 19:30.454
OK, I'm done playing.

19:31.455 --> 19:34.166
- Balls are next.
- Stop! Oh! Ah!

19:34.250 --> 19:38.420
OK! OK! OK, please.
Please don't hurt me any more. I'll talk.

19:38.504 --> 19:42.258
Please don't hurt me any more.
Aguatecture. Aguatecture!

19:42.341 --> 19:44.134
I'll tell you. Just take your foot off.

19:44.218 --> 19:46.845
Please! I'll tell you everything!

19:52.351 --> 19:53.602
Lovely morning.

19:55.187 --> 19:58.232
- Depends where you're sitting.
- Ah, it's not so terrible.

19:58.315 --> 20:00.276
You'll make more money.

20:00.359 --> 20:02.736
There's always more money
in your line of work.

20:02.820 --> 20:05.573
And there's always more blackmail.

20:05.656 --> 20:07.867
What's to stop you from coming back?

20:07.950 --> 20:10.536
- I give you my word.
- You're blackmailing me.

20:10.619 --> 20:13.664
You've threatened to destroy my life
unless I give you money.

20:13.747 --> 20:17.293
Yes, and now I promise
I'll never do it again. Cross my heart.

20:18.502 --> 20:19.795
I have kids.

20:19.879 --> 20:22.089
I know. Took their pictures.

20:22.798 --> 20:24.008
Handsome boys.

20:24.925 --> 20:26.677
Can I have my money now?

20:26.760 --> 20:29.638
They're not just handsome,
they're also smart.

20:29.722 --> 20:32.558
Especially Shane. Off the charts.

20:32.641 --> 20:36.228
There's $100 buy-in at Commerce in an hour
and I'd really like to be there, so...

20:36.312 --> 20:39.940
You're mugging me, you piece of shit.
You'll take a minute to listen to what I say.

20:40.024 --> 20:42.693
My smart son, Shane,
took me to a store yesterday.

20:42.776 --> 20:45.571
- Panorama City, off the 405.
- Can I know where this is going?

20:45.654 --> 20:48.324
Spyware store. You ever been there?
It was my first time.

20:48.407 --> 20:52.828
Bought myself a teeny little microphone
that you hide inside your blouse.

20:54.830 --> 20:57.249
Records everything you say.

20:57.333 --> 21:00.336
Transmits it back to Shane's computer,
actually, any computer.

21:00.419 --> 21:03.047
Only 49.95.

21:03.130 --> 21:05.841
Technology's come a long way.

21:05.925 --> 21:08.594
And, since blackmailing's a felony,

21:08.677 --> 21:10.930
even when you do it
to alleged drug dealers,

21:11.055 --> 21:14.516
you probably want me to keep
this conversation to myself.

21:15.517 --> 21:18.562
So, I guess what we have here is a détente.

21:18.646 --> 21:22.566
You tell the police what I do for a living,
not good for me.

21:22.650 --> 21:24.693
I tell the police you blackmailed me,

21:24.777 --> 21:26.237
not good for you.

21:28.572 --> 21:29.949
Understood.

21:31.492 --> 21:33.202
Now...

21:33.285 --> 21:36.080
I don't know who your client is
but I have a pretty good idea.

21:36.121 --> 21:38.249
Whether or not you tell her
what I do is up to you

21:38.332 --> 21:40.501
but I strongly advise against it.

21:47.758 --> 21:49.426
This is for me?

21:52.263 --> 21:54.139
Ha! It's a lovely morning after all!

21:54.223 --> 21:56.183
Go fuck yourself.

21:56.267 --> 22:00.646
Honey, if I could, I'd save a fortune
in strippers and alimony.

22:01.146 --> 22:03.399
I'm off to Commerce. You wish me luck?

22:11.699 --> 22:14.034
So, how much do you have for me this time?

22:14.118 --> 22:15.786
500?

22:15.870 --> 22:17.371
200?

22:17.454 --> 22:19.164
Some loose change?

22:19.248 --> 22:20.332
I don't have anything.

22:20.416 --> 22:23.210
- Shocking.
- And it's your fault.

22:23.294 --> 22:25.546
Oh, really? How's that?

22:25.629 --> 22:29.884
The private investigator you hired
shook me down,

22:29.967 --> 22:32.386
took all the money I was gonna give you.

22:33.345 --> 22:37.099
- Shook you down? For what?
- None of your goddamn business.

22:37.892 --> 22:40.352
But now I have nothing

22:40.436 --> 22:43.397
and, frankly, I'm pissed.

22:43.480 --> 22:45.482
- You're pissed?
- Yeah.

22:46.192 --> 22:49.486
You didn't trust me and you really should have.
I was gonna get your money.

22:49.570 --> 22:50.738
- Sure you were.
- I was.

22:50.821 --> 22:53.115
And, by the way,
it wasn't even your money.

22:54.283 --> 22:55.910
I was legally entitled to it.

22:56.619 --> 22:58.954
Mrs Scottson number two. Me.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.540
Not you.

23:02.833 --> 23:06.754
But now it's his, and that isn't my fault.

23:06.837 --> 23:10.299
So, I guess the whole point
is moot, actually.

23:11.467 --> 23:13.135
Then why are you here?

23:14.178 --> 23:15.846
I thought...

23:15.930 --> 23:17.723
I needed a friend.

23:20.559 --> 23:22.603
I don't... need a friend.

23:22.686 --> 23:23.854
I don't need anybody.

23:26.649 --> 23:28.275
Don't call me.

23:29.735 --> 23:31.362
Bye.

23:43.582 --> 23:46.252
Please tell me you were
just in the neighbourhood.

23:46.335 --> 23:49.797
Your friend Celia came to Aguatecture.

23:51.215 --> 23:52.758
How the hell?

23:54.385 --> 23:57.096
She see anything?
What does she know?

23:57.179 --> 23:59.181
I was wondering the same thing, so I called her,

23:59.265 --> 24:01.183
cos I still had her number in my phone.

24:02.309 --> 24:05.312
And she told me to tell you
she knows you fucked her boyfriend...

24:06.230 --> 24:08.274
and she knows you're dealing again...

24:08.357 --> 24:10.860
and she'll be in touch.

24:15.155 --> 24:17.366
She'll be in touch.

24:19.535 --> 24:21.829
How bad is this, Nancy?
