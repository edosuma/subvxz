00:33.844 --> 00:35.678
My Uncle
Jim once told me

00:35.680 --> 00:37.913
that life is about change.

00:37.915 --> 00:42.918
Not just change, but how
we respond to change.

00:42.920 --> 00:44.953
I didn't know what
he meant at the time.

00:44.955 --> 00:48.025
But I'm beginning to understand.

00:49.727 --> 00:51.894
This old junk around
here is just a remnant

00:51.896 --> 00:54.229
of a once mighty salvage yard.

00:54.231 --> 00:56.031
It was how my
parents made a living

00:56.033 --> 00:59.169
and how my brother
Ben and me lived.

01:00.570 --> 01:01.904
The memories we made here

01:01.906 --> 01:05.175
echo from every
corner of this place.

01:17.487 --> 01:18.586
Stop pulling Ben.

01:18.588 --> 01:19.855
You stop pulling.

01:19.857 --> 01:21.323
Oh no,
not my computer!

01:21.325 --> 01:23.158
We don't need your
fancy computer anyways.

01:23.160 --> 01:26.864
Don't
speak to me right now.

01:29.033 --> 01:30.933
Hard times affect
everyone though.

01:30.935 --> 01:33.268
And when my parents closed
the gate to the junk business,

01:33.270 --> 01:37.873
it felt like the door to my
childhood closed with it.

01:37.875 --> 01:39.341
Ben's gone now.

01:39.343 --> 01:41.777
Don't worry, he didn't
die or anything.

01:41.779 --> 01:43.211
I guess he'd just
rather spend his summer

01:43.213 --> 01:46.014
helping screw up kids
at some camp somewhere

01:46.016 --> 01:49.985
than spend it at home
with his only brother.

01:49.987 --> 01:54.324
At least I've got these old
memories to keep me company.

02:06.636 --> 02:08.103
Whatever you need fixed,

02:08.104 --> 02:10.038
Fix It Boys can put the
pieces back together.

02:10.039 --> 02:12.376
That's our business motto.

03:07.597 --> 03:11.800
So you need us to find the
missing pearls for you then?

03:11.802 --> 03:13.270
Yes.

03:17.041 --> 03:19.474
Little did I know that
one particular memory

03:19.476 --> 03:22.610
was about to resurface
and change the hearts

03:22.612 --> 03:24.448
of a few wayward boys.

04:28.545 --> 04:30.247
River Trail Junction?

04:31.115 --> 04:33.150
This is a goose chase.

04:41.691 --> 04:43.158
Gentlemen, leaf A represents

04:43.160 --> 04:44.726
our current starting position.

04:44.728 --> 04:47.963
Our first obstacle will be these
hazardous limestone ledges,

04:47.965 --> 04:49.264
represented here.

04:49.266 --> 04:51.833
Then we will continue
our trek here

04:51.835 --> 04:53.135
to the checkpoint Bravo.

04:53.137 --> 04:54.402
From there, we will...

04:54.404 --> 04:55.570
What are you
talking about dork?

04:55.572 --> 04:57.940
It's just some dumb sticks.

04:57.942 --> 05:01.076
The sticks and the
leaves are symbolic artura!

05:01.078 --> 05:02.544
What'd you call me?

05:02.546 --> 05:07.249
It's Spanish, from my
modeling stint in Mexico City.

05:07.251 --> 05:10.988
Well it's still
just some dumb sticks.

05:16.060 --> 05:17.926
You really
shouldn't agitate him.

05:17.928 --> 05:19.594
What does that mean anyhow?

05:19.596 --> 05:20.662
Bear-man.

05:20.664 --> 05:22.864
Appropriate.

05:22.866 --> 05:24.266
Word on the street

05:24.268 --> 05:25.800
is that he actually
likes to hurt puppies.

05:25.802 --> 05:27.169
What street?

05:27.171 --> 05:30.205
You look like you
live in your basement.

05:30.207 --> 05:32.840
Basements happen to
be ideal environments

05:32.842 --> 05:35.510
for scientific experimentation.

05:35.512 --> 05:36.446
Whatever.

05:49.226 --> 05:51.293
Okay guys, got
your stuff packed?

05:51.295 --> 05:54.364
My brother should
be here any minute.

06:05.642 --> 06:07.411
Hey what?

06:08.745 --> 06:10.981
Whoa, look at that guy.

06:16.320 --> 06:17.885
That's my brother.

06:17.887 --> 06:20.524
He does look quiet Salian.

06:36.740 --> 06:38.573
Ooosh.

06:40.677 --> 06:42.412
You guys wait here.

06:44.281 --> 06:47.082
I knew we should have
adjusted that kick stand.

06:47.084 --> 06:48.550
And this is all
your fault anyway,

06:48.552 --> 06:50.785
you didn't even
fix the dumb bike.

06:50.787 --> 06:52.587
I've been driving on
that bike two hours

06:52.589 --> 06:57.192
in this heat, and I have
no idea why I'm even here.

06:57.194 --> 07:00.195
Come on, there's some
people I want you to meet.

07:00.197 --> 07:03.033
And I can't even feel my butt.

07:05.235 --> 07:07.302
You guys, meet
my brother Cricket.

07:07.304 --> 07:11.206
You have a nice trip?

07:11.208 --> 07:13.141
It would've been nicer
if I knew I was coming

07:13.143 --> 07:15.110
all the way out here in
the middle of nowhere.

07:15.112 --> 07:16.111
I thought you were going to do

07:16.113 --> 07:17.779
your helping back at the camp?

07:17.781 --> 07:19.947
Small change of plans.

07:19.949 --> 07:21.516
We decided to go
camping instead.

07:21.518 --> 07:22.250
What?

07:22.252 --> 07:23.518
You know I don't camp.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.553
You know what's in these woods?

07:25.555 --> 07:28.956
The complete absence of internet,
indoor plumbing, security.

07:28.958 --> 07:31.126
Essential heating or cooling.

07:31.128 --> 07:33.395
Humidity plays
havoc with my hair.

07:33.397 --> 07:35.530
I've got your
havoc right here.

07:35.532 --> 07:38.300
And you want me to
do it with these kids?

07:38.302 --> 07:40.368
Huh, given the
weight of our packs,

07:40.370 --> 07:43.205
this might actually
put us at checkpoint B,

07:43.207 --> 07:45.473
seven minutes later.

07:45.475 --> 07:47.242
Oh
look, it's raining.

07:47.244 --> 07:50.380
Better figure that
into your map.

07:52.449 --> 07:54.849
Can't you do your helping
just as good back at the camp?

07:54.851 --> 07:57.785
Us counselors thought taking
the kids out in smalls groups

07:57.787 --> 08:01.022
into the woods would give
us more individual time.

08:01.024 --> 08:02.023
They're good kids.

08:02.025 --> 08:03.258
Here, I'll show you.

08:03.260 --> 08:06.394
Guys, say hi to my brother.

08:11.235 --> 08:12.536
Hi, Marty is it?

08:13.903 --> 08:16.338
Where did you get those
fine tooth specimens?

08:16.340 --> 08:19.407
Are they part of a collection?

08:19.409 --> 08:21.143
Yeah I collect 'em
all from the last kid

08:21.145 --> 08:23.711
who asked me a stupid question.

08:23.713 --> 08:25.580
You appear to be a
possible intellect.

08:25.582 --> 08:30.051
It'll be nice to have an
actual human to talk to.

08:30.053 --> 08:31.453
I heard bears and pinions

08:31.455 --> 08:34.688
when I hiked the Andes
Mountains in Africa.

08:34.691 --> 08:37.892
The Andes Mountains
are in South America.

08:37.894 --> 08:39.827
I meant the Himalayas.

08:39.828 --> 08:40.861
Seriously?

08:40.864 --> 08:42.130
The Himalayas are in...

08:42.131 --> 08:43.565
Alright guys, we
better get going

08:43.567 --> 08:47.404
if we're gonna make it
to camp by nightfall.

09:33.016 --> 09:33.850
Hey.

09:35.685 --> 09:36.620
Where's Marty?

09:47.964 --> 09:50.097
What's he doing up there?

09:50.099 --> 09:51.535
I don't know.

09:53.870 --> 09:55.503
Come on Marty, let's go.

09:55.505 --> 09:57.639
Get down from there.

10:15.459 --> 10:17.124
Come on Pierce, push me.

10:17.126 --> 10:20.061
Push me, push me, come on.

10:20.063 --> 10:20.897
Blech.

10:22.532 --> 10:24.899
Alright, let's take a break.

10:28.104 --> 10:29.639
Hey.

10:30.340 --> 10:31.808
Get me outta here.

10:33.610 --> 10:34.444
Hey.

10:46.456 --> 10:49.056
You really think
this is doing any good?

10:49.058 --> 10:51.926
Well, just follow the
compass north to the river.

10:51.928 --> 10:55.765
No, I mean being out
here with these kids.

11:02.606 --> 11:05.440
Suppose it doesn't
seem like it.

11:05.442 --> 11:08.376
Marty there, he's the tough one.

11:08.378 --> 11:10.312
I really think deep down
he's got a tender heart

11:10.314 --> 11:11.779
but he just uses his toughness

11:11.781 --> 11:13.815
to keep himself
from getting hurt.

11:13.817 --> 11:16.017
Also keeps everyone
else from getting close.

11:16.019 --> 11:19.621
And there's Pierce, who's
a bit stuck on himself.

11:19.623 --> 11:22.326
Like someone I used to know.

11:23.527 --> 11:25.493
He's a habitual liar too,

11:25.495 --> 11:27.429
so don't believe too
much of what he says.

11:27.431 --> 11:28.863
I was wondering about that.

11:28.865 --> 11:30.765
What about little
Einstein over there?

11:30.767 --> 11:32.900
Stanley, he's a walking brain.

11:32.902 --> 11:35.603
He thinks he's got the
answers to everything.

11:35.605 --> 11:38.908
That's what tends to
get him in trouble.

11:42.011 --> 11:43.345
Hey watch it dork boy.

11:43.347 --> 11:45.513
I apologize Marty, I
was trying to calculate

11:45.515 --> 11:48.583
our current position, as
I feel we're off course.

11:48.585 --> 11:51.753
Who's gonna apologize
for messing up my shirt?

11:51.755 --> 11:52.587
Huh?

11:52.589 --> 11:55.291
Alright guys, break it up.

11:56.593 --> 11:58.593
It does seem like we shoulda
come to the river by now.

11:58.595 --> 11:59.927
You sure that thing's
working right?

11:59.929 --> 12:00.930
Should be.

12:02.399 --> 12:03.498
Maybe there's
something in your pocket

12:03.500 --> 12:05.600
throwing off the magnetic pole.

12:05.602 --> 12:07.003
Let me check.

12:17.714 --> 12:19.013
I forgot these were in there.

12:19.015 --> 12:21.583
Cricket, where'd
you find these?

12:21.585 --> 12:22.584
At the old headquarters.

12:22.586 --> 12:23.618
What's the big deal?

12:23.620 --> 12:24.952
Don't you know what these are?

12:24.954 --> 12:27.389
Just some fake pearls
for playing dress up.

12:27.391 --> 12:28.990
Relic from a phase
of your youth.

12:28.992 --> 12:31.092
First of all that
wasn't my phase.

12:31.094 --> 12:32.527
Second, don't you remember?

12:32.529 --> 12:34.664
These are the pearls.

12:35.765 --> 12:38.502
You mean the lost, prison,

12:39.803 --> 12:42.839
stakeout, divorce,
Fix It, pearls?

12:44.207 --> 12:45.907
Yes!

12:45.909 --> 12:47.343
This is so lame.

12:48.177 --> 12:51.278
Their vocabulary is abysmal.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.382
Uncle Jim.

12:53.517 --> 12:55.850
He'd be happy we
finally found 'em.

12:55.852 --> 12:58.285
The stake out,
it was a good plan.

12:58.287 --> 13:01.689
- It caught the thief, kinda.
- Excuse me for interrupting

13:01.691 --> 13:04.091
this touching moment,
but what are you two

13:04.093 --> 13:05.927
even talking about?

13:05.929 --> 13:08.396
Yes, did I hear
you mention a thief?

13:08.398 --> 13:09.897
And prison?

13:09.899 --> 13:11.833
Think we should
tell 'em the story?

13:11.835 --> 13:13.668
They wouldn't be interested.

13:13.670 --> 13:15.839
Let's get to that river.

13:42.699 --> 13:46.636
The river at last.

13:47.471 --> 13:48.472
Now east.

13:55.311 --> 13:56.678
Large fellow,
have you ever seen

13:56.680 --> 14:00.450
such a beautiful three
leaf plant before?

14:01.918 --> 14:02.986
I wouldn't.

14:03.820 --> 14:06.155
You two messing with me?

14:09.659 --> 14:11.895
That was poison ivy.

14:14.030 --> 14:14.831
I know.

14:39.756 --> 14:42.256
I can't go another step.

14:42.258 --> 14:43.658
I concur.

14:43.660 --> 14:44.759
Wasn't the objective
to camp by the river?

14:44.761 --> 14:46.794
Here's a river.

14:46.796 --> 14:49.764
Really, how far into the outdoors
do we need to go anyway?

14:49.766 --> 14:51.733
Alright, alright.

14:51.735 --> 14:53.367
There's a level spot over there.

14:53.369 --> 14:55.939
Let's camp there for the night.

15:11.487 --> 15:15.790
The smell of fresh air.

15:15.792 --> 15:18.595
Hey get that
stink away from me.

15:19.929 --> 15:21.696
I'm curious, does the story
that you previously cited

15:21.698 --> 15:23.497
that we wouldn't
be interested in,

15:23.499 --> 15:25.700
involve science, by any chance?

15:25.702 --> 15:26.634
Who cares about that.

15:26.636 --> 15:27.869
Does anyone get clobbered?

15:27.871 --> 15:30.104
And most importantly,
is there any

15:30.106 --> 15:33.677
good looking adventurous
people in it?

15:34.911 --> 15:37.344
If you're gonna tell
it, tell it right.

15:37.346 --> 15:38.780
Start at the beginning.

15:38.782 --> 15:40.247
Guys, what I'm about to tell you

15:40.249 --> 15:42.550
isn't just any old
campfire story.

15:42.552 --> 15:45.386
It's a story of mystery,
adventure and danger,

15:45.388 --> 15:46.788
all rolled into one.

15:46.790 --> 15:49.891
It all began about five
years ago back at our home

15:49.893 --> 15:52.326
at the Jungle of Gold junkyard.

15:52.328 --> 15:53.930
Jungle of Gold?

15:56.232 --> 15:58.165
The name of our
parents' junkyard.

15:58.167 --> 16:00.702
And the location of our
Fix It Boys headquarters.

16:20.590 --> 16:21.923
Although
it was a junkyard,

16:21.925 --> 16:24.525
we never really thought
of any of it as junk.

16:24.527 --> 16:28.329
For us, it was a place of
mechanical treasures and wonder.

16:28.331 --> 16:30.798
With a last name like
Junk, I guess you could say

16:30.800 --> 16:34.070
we were born to do
this sort of work.

16:36.072 --> 16:37.639
Our parents were
on the road a lot,

16:37.641 --> 16:41.577
so they relied on Uncle
Jim to look after us.

16:50.086 --> 16:54.555
♪ Baby I need you like a
spark plug needs a wire

16:54.557 --> 16:58.292
Though sometimes I
think us looking after Uncle Jim

16:58.294 --> 17:01.831
is what my parents
really had in mind.

17:19.749 --> 17:22.016
Growing up around all that
junk, I mean treasure,

17:22.018 --> 17:24.952
we learned how to fix
just about anything.

17:24.954 --> 17:27.387
And I'm not just talking
about toy wagons,

17:27.390 --> 17:29.290
but important stuff too.

17:29.292 --> 17:30.858
We became so good in fact,

17:30.860 --> 17:32.960
that we opened our
own Fix It business.

17:32.962 --> 17:34.295
Whatever you need fixed,

17:34.297 --> 17:36.998
the Fit It Boys can put
the pieces together.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.736
That was our business motto.

17:44.073 --> 17:45.907
Until that hot July morning,

17:45.909 --> 17:49.476
I didn't think there wasn't
anything we couldn't fix.

17:49.478 --> 17:51.112
Boy were we wrong.

17:51.114 --> 17:54.150
And that's where
the story begins.

18:17.040 --> 18:19.573
Are you putting grease
in your hair again?

18:19.575 --> 18:20.908
Don't be ridiculous.

18:20.910 --> 18:22.844
It's motor oil.

18:22.846 --> 18:24.478
Can't improve on perfection.

18:26.149 --> 18:29.083
And your transmitter
looks goofy, by the way.

18:29.085 --> 18:32.219
Perhaps however, unlike
most of your gadgetries,

18:32.221 --> 18:34.722
my wireless modem
actually works.

18:34.724 --> 18:36.357
You won't think it's
so silly when I land us

18:36.359 --> 18:38.425
some Fix It business
this summer.

18:38.427 --> 18:40.061
Now you'd probably
assume that Cricket was

18:40.063 --> 18:41.763
the brains of the operation.

18:41.765 --> 18:43.097
We could use some new tread.

18:43.099 --> 18:45.066
And I was just the
incredibly handsome,

18:45.068 --> 18:46.934
muscular brawn of the team.

18:46.936 --> 18:49.871
Oh
brother, humility Ben.

18:49.873 --> 18:52.306
Okay, I'll admit that
my mechanical innovations

18:52.308 --> 18:56.978
have been know to go
a little, haywire.

18:56.980 --> 18:59.246
Like the time I rewired the
courthouse for the mayor.

18:59.248 --> 19:00.581
I'm telling you
it's the this one...

19:00.583 --> 19:01.849
No, it's this one.

19:01.851 --> 19:02.850
I'm telling you,
this is the one

19:02.852 --> 19:04.151
that will turn off the lights.

19:04.153 --> 19:06.153
But this one is marked
security checkpoint.

19:06.155 --> 19:07.755
Well then it's labeled wrong.

19:07.757 --> 19:09.791
So would you just
trust me for once?

19:21.704 --> 19:22.906
Oh, it's bang.

19:23.672 --> 19:25.006
I've been telling you

19:25.008 --> 19:27.909
we need to build solar
panels for headquarters.

19:27.911 --> 19:29.410
Yeah, that's easy.

19:29.412 --> 19:31.946
You know Cricket, I've been
thinking about this summer.

19:31.948 --> 19:33.180
And I think I know what we need.

19:33.182 --> 19:36.050
A firizer signed
for your hair?

19:36.052 --> 19:38.652
A challenge, I mean a
real Fix It challenge.

19:38.654 --> 19:42.289
Wasn't designing the
prosthetic leg for the Yoder kid

19:42.291 --> 19:44.491
last summer challenge
enough for you?

19:44.493 --> 19:46.293
Yeah, but the
part's already there.

19:46.295 --> 19:47.962
All we did was put it together.

19:47.964 --> 19:50.631
We made it from
a Rex 72 Pinto.

19:52.869 --> 19:55.071
Hello in there.

19:58.141 --> 20:01.809
Uncle Jim's in
charge of car parts.

20:01.811 --> 20:03.510
It's just some girl.

20:03.512 --> 20:06.313
Could be our first
customer of the summer.

20:06.315 --> 20:07.150
Right.

20:08.617 --> 20:10.117
What do you want?

20:10.119 --> 20:12.319
Well that's not a very nice
way to welcome a visitor.

20:12.321 --> 20:14.989
Can't you say something
nice, like hello, how are you

20:14.991 --> 20:19.262
or how about welcome,
we're the Jungle Junk Boys.

20:20.830 --> 20:22.365
I hate that name.

20:23.632 --> 20:24.765
Okay, welcome.

20:24.767 --> 20:26.000
We're the Fix It boys.

20:26.002 --> 20:27.001
Now what do you want?

20:27.003 --> 20:28.302
My name is Mary Beth Anne

20:28.304 --> 20:31.038
and I have something
that needs to be fixed.

20:31.040 --> 20:32.773
You have three first names.

20:32.775 --> 20:34.108
So?

20:34.110 --> 20:35.176
It's just kinda weird.

20:35.178 --> 20:37.213
You're one too talk.

20:39.615 --> 20:40.714
A customer?

20:40.716 --> 20:42.483
She's just a kid though.

20:42.485 --> 20:44.253
Is her money green?

20:46.589 --> 20:48.289
What color's your money?

20:48.291 --> 20:52.862
The color of a princess'
eyes in a field of clover.

20:58.034 --> 21:01.402
I love what you've
done with the place.

21:01.404 --> 21:02.103
Nice cross.

21:02.105 --> 21:04.307
It's a wireless modem.

21:08.044 --> 21:10.513
I've been looking for that.

21:16.986 --> 21:18.920
Hi, I'm Cricket and
this is my brother Ben.

21:18.922 --> 21:20.254
How can we help you?

21:20.256 --> 21:21.788
Well first I would
like to thank you

21:21.790 --> 21:23.224
for seeing me without
an appointment.

21:23.226 --> 21:24.825
I don't recognize
you from school.

21:24.827 --> 21:25.726
I'm homeschooled.

21:25.728 --> 21:27.061
I found you online.

21:27.063 --> 21:29.196
You have a wonderful
internet presence.

21:29.198 --> 21:30.764
And your knack for
mechanical betterment

21:30.766 --> 21:32.199
is practically legendary.

21:32.201 --> 21:33.267
It is.

21:33.269 --> 21:35.236
I even heard you
mastered a Rubik's Cube.

21:35.238 --> 21:36.904
It's quite simple actually.

21:36.906 --> 21:38.405
We simply disassembled a cube

21:38.407 --> 21:40.741
and put the pieces back
together the correct way.

21:40.743 --> 21:42.109
Even so.

21:42.111 --> 21:44.611
What is it you need
us to fix for you?

21:44.613 --> 21:47.748
My parents, you see,
they're getting a divorce.

21:47.750 --> 21:50.251
I'm sorry, but we don't
do marriage counseling.

21:50.253 --> 21:52.786
It doesn't matter, 'cause
they already done that.

21:52.788 --> 21:54.321
And what happened?

21:54.323 --> 21:56.457
Well it all began when we
first started going to church

21:56.459 --> 21:57.758
near our home.

21:57.760 --> 21:59.927
And the preacher there,
Pastor Murphy, saw right away

21:59.929 --> 22:02.129
that my parents'
marriage was in trouble.

22:02.131 --> 22:03.664
So he counseled them.

22:03.666 --> 22:05.266
Things seemed to get
better for a while.

22:05.268 --> 22:07.168
And they just got worse again.

22:07.170 --> 22:09.203
I'm very sorry, but
as I said we don't...

22:09.205 --> 22:12.976
Would you let her
tell the story already?

22:14.978 --> 22:17.311
As I was saying, one
night Pastor and his wife

22:17.313 --> 22:21.682
came to try talking with
my parents one last time.

22:21.684 --> 22:26.587
Love is patient, love is
kind, it does not boast.

22:26.589 --> 22:29.090
He
talked for a long time.

22:29.092 --> 22:31.692
He read to my parents
from his Bible a lot too.

22:31.694 --> 22:34.661
But you see we never had
gone to church much before,

22:34.663 --> 22:37.064
so I didn't hardly
understand anything

22:37.066 --> 22:39.033
of what he was saying.

22:39.035 --> 22:40.401
It keeps
no record of wrongs.

22:40.403 --> 22:42.269
And I don't think
my parents did either.

22:42.271 --> 22:44.771
Love does not delight in evil,

22:44.773 --> 22:47.541
but rejoices with the truth.

22:47.543 --> 22:52.513
God's word is here to
help your marriage.

22:52.515 --> 22:55.182
Did it help, the
Bible stuff, I mean?

22:55.184 --> 22:58.219
Dad just got
angry and Mom cried.

22:58.221 --> 22:59.820
Ben, conference.

22:59.822 --> 23:01.390
Excuse us a moment.

23:03.792 --> 23:05.192
What is it?

23:05.194 --> 23:08.262
This stuff, it's out of
our field of expertise.

23:08.264 --> 23:10.331
She's not asking us
to fix her moped.

23:10.333 --> 23:12.966
She's asking us to save her
parents' from getting a divorce.

23:12.968 --> 23:14.168
A divorce!

23:14.170 --> 23:15.202
Yeah, so?

23:15.204 --> 23:16.203
So we can't help her.

23:16.205 --> 23:17.604
And the longer we lead her on,

23:17.606 --> 23:19.273
the more hurt she's
going to be in the end

23:19.275 --> 23:21.042
when we tell her
we can't help her.

23:21.044 --> 23:22.509
Maybe she just needs
to talk you know.

23:22.511 --> 23:24.245
She hasn't asked
for anything yet.

23:24.247 --> 23:27.414
Then tell me Dr. Phil, why
else would she come here?

23:27.416 --> 23:30.486
We're the Fix It Boys, remember?

23:32.688 --> 23:36.090
Mary Beth, how
exactly can we help you?

23:36.092 --> 23:38.025
I was getting to that part.

23:38.027 --> 23:39.593
I was still watching
from the stairs

23:39.595 --> 23:41.628
when they're getting
ready to leave.

23:41.630 --> 23:43.697
And that's when I
heard him say it.

23:43.699 --> 23:45.866
Pastor Murphy told his wife:

23:45.868 --> 23:48.735
If they could just find
the pearl of great price.

23:48.737 --> 23:50.471
That if only my
parents could find

23:50.473 --> 23:54.075
the pearl of great price then
that would be the foundation

23:54.077 --> 23:56.445
to healing their marriage.

23:57.780 --> 23:59.913
Pearl of great price?

23:59.915 --> 24:01.048
Yeah, I don't get it either.

24:01.050 --> 24:02.483
What pearl?

24:02.485 --> 24:04.518
I was thinking a lot about
that and I think I know.

24:04.520 --> 24:06.687
When things were getting
better between my parents,

24:06.689 --> 24:08.822
my dad went out and
bought a really nice,

24:08.824 --> 24:11.325
real expensive pearl
necklace for my mom

24:11.327 --> 24:12.359
for their anniversary.

24:12.361 --> 24:14.395
Women love jewelry.

24:14.397 --> 24:15.962
But a thief broke into
our house and stole it.

24:15.964 --> 24:16.930
A thief?

24:16.932 --> 24:18.365
What did the police do?

24:18.367 --> 24:20.201
Since there wasn't any
signs of an actual break in,

24:20.203 --> 24:21.768
the police won't do nothing.

24:21.770 --> 24:25.472
And even worse, my dad thinks
my mom just lost the necklace.

24:25.474 --> 24:28.175
Perhaps your mother
simply misplaced it.

24:28.177 --> 24:30.311
My mom is a total neat freak

24:30.313 --> 24:33.414
and 2nd, I found a muddy
boot print on our carpet

24:33.416 --> 24:36.350
that is too big to belong
to anybody in my family.

24:36.352 --> 24:38.485
Incredible, it
makes sense too.

24:38.487 --> 24:40.721
Your dad thinks your
mom lost his gift,

24:40.723 --> 24:42.089
his token of love.

24:42.091 --> 24:44.057
It's no wonder they
fight all the time.

24:44.059 --> 24:45.326
Why don't you ask your parents

24:45.328 --> 24:46.927
what the pearl of
great price is?

24:46.929 --> 24:47.994
Well I can't do that.

24:47.996 --> 24:49.330
They fight so much now

24:49.332 --> 24:50.964
that if I were to mention
the missing pearls,

24:50.966 --> 24:54.635
that I know that it would just
make them fight even more.

24:54.637 --> 24:58.839
So you need us to find the
missing pearls for you then?

24:58.841 --> 25:00.307
Yes.

25:00.309 --> 25:01.608
Excuse us.

25:01.610 --> 25:02.545
Conference.

25:04.480 --> 25:08.449
You were so right, this
is way out of our league.

25:08.451 --> 25:11.418
I especialize in
electrical engineering,

25:11.420 --> 25:13.420
not mystery solving.

25:13.422 --> 25:15.524
Better let me tell her.

25:17.025 --> 25:18.292
We'll take the job.

25:18.294 --> 25:19.926
Oh this is so wonderful!

25:19.928 --> 25:21.462
No, now just wait...

25:21.464 --> 25:23.397
I prayed to God just this
morning that you would help me

25:23.399 --> 25:24.931
and when I saw your
cross I knew that...

25:24.933 --> 25:26.367
It's a wireless modem.

25:26.369 --> 25:28.169
There's just one last
thing that you need to know.

25:28.171 --> 25:30.137
My parents are getting
divorced tomorrow morning.

25:30.139 --> 25:32.306
So you have to have the
necklace back by then.

25:32.308 --> 25:34.308
Tomorrow morning?

25:34.310 --> 25:36.512
So when can you start?

♪ Baby I need you

25:53.362 --> 25:54.928
What are you singing?

25:54.930 --> 25:57.431
Oh, I'm writing this little
love diddy for my girlfriend.

25:57.433 --> 25:58.832
When you boys gets
a little older,

25:58.834 --> 26:00.634
I'll teach you these
matters of the heart.

26:00.636 --> 26:03.204
Here, take a listen
to what I got so far.

26:19.655 --> 26:20.354
Who's the girl?

26:20.356 --> 26:21.388
A client.

26:21.390 --> 26:22.289
We've got some work to do.

26:22.291 --> 26:24.791
We'll be back later.

26:24.793 --> 26:26.327
I'll be here.

26:26.329 --> 26:31.031
I got a tiger by the tail

27:05.234 --> 27:08.001
You've never ridden a bike?

27:08.003 --> 27:10.136
Hello, helmet hair.

27:10.138 --> 27:12.306
This all probably could've
been averted if Mary's parents

27:12.308 --> 27:13.707
had the foresight to install

27:13.709 --> 27:15.909
a property security
system in their home.

27:15.911 --> 27:17.511
How do you figure
that Stanley?

27:17.513 --> 27:19.480
No lost pearls,
no marital discord.

27:19.482 --> 27:22.182
It wasn't the lost pearls
that made 'em fight you nudnick.

27:22.184 --> 27:24.351
Very insightful bruiser.

27:24.353 --> 27:27.222
I know about parents fighting.

27:29.425 --> 27:30.824
On the surface Stanley,

27:30.826 --> 27:33.594
it seems to be the only
logical conclusion.

27:33.596 --> 27:36.697
But it's a lot more complicated
than simply lost jewelry.

27:36.699 --> 27:40.166
At that point the lost pearls
was all we had to go off of.

27:40.168 --> 27:42.803
So then you found the pearls?

27:45.741 --> 27:49.543
Well, first we needed
to investigate the clues.

27:49.545 --> 27:51.244
We started at the
scene of the crime.

27:51.246 --> 27:53.079
Mary Beth's house.

27:53.081 --> 27:54.581
Could just be your dad's print.

27:54.583 --> 27:59.185
My mother has bigger
feet than my dad.

28:04.427 --> 28:05.726
13 inches.

28:05.728 --> 28:08.061
Sure it wasn't
Bigfoot who broke in?

28:08.063 --> 28:09.596
So let me get this straight.

28:09.598 --> 28:11.798
There are no broken
windows, no kicked in doors,

28:11.800 --> 28:13.600
no tunneling into the basement.

28:13.602 --> 28:15.704
Just this one boot print?

28:19.942 --> 28:21.274
What do you think?

28:21.276 --> 28:23.043
I think we should
call Nancy Drew.

28:23.045 --> 28:24.478
That's what I think.

28:24.480 --> 28:27.348
Cricket, I don't think
Nancy Drew's a real person.

28:27.350 --> 28:28.482
I know she's
not a real person.

28:28.484 --> 28:30.050
I'm just saying.

28:30.052 --> 28:33.286
I'm just saying we have
nothing here to go on.

28:33.288 --> 28:34.355
We have a boot print.

28:34.357 --> 28:35.589
It's kinda like a clue.

28:35.591 --> 28:37.458
We have our first clue.

28:37.460 --> 28:39.660
Gimme something real,
something mechanical.

28:39.662 --> 28:42.095
Then I'll find us a real clue.

28:42.097 --> 28:43.999
Something mechanical.

28:46.101 --> 28:47.703
Great idea Cricket.

28:54.910 --> 28:58.445
You're very skillful
with a screwdriver.

28:58.447 --> 28:59.913
Thanks.

28:59.915 --> 29:01.684
Just one more turn.

29:07.222 --> 29:08.991
Something mechanical.

29:14.730 --> 29:16.597
I knew you boys enjoyed
tearing things apart,

29:16.599 --> 29:19.500
but we really don't
have time for this.

29:19.502 --> 29:20.701
Your robber didn't
break anything

29:20.703 --> 29:22.235
getting into your house, right?

29:22.237 --> 29:24.805
Which means he either had
to have a key to the lock

29:24.807 --> 29:25.906
or he picked it.

29:25.908 --> 29:27.307
It's quite difficult
to pick a lock

29:27.309 --> 29:28.875
without leaving evidence behind.

29:28.877 --> 29:31.678
You seem to know an awful
lot about picking locks.

29:31.680 --> 29:35.851
Cars come into the junkyard
all the time without keys.

29:41.023 --> 29:42.923
Wow, would ya look at that?

29:42.925 --> 29:44.290
Intriguing.

29:44.292 --> 29:45.894
Uh yeah, amazing.

29:46.962 --> 29:48.094
What is it?

29:48.096 --> 29:49.362
It's a broken pick.

29:49.364 --> 29:50.631
Looks like someone
got in a hurry.

29:50.633 --> 29:52.032
Amateurs.

29:52.034 --> 29:53.400
Pick?

29:53.402 --> 29:54.668
It's what was used
to unlock the door.

29:54.670 --> 29:57.370
Except it's not
an actual pick.

29:57.372 --> 29:58.739
What do you mean?

29:58.741 --> 30:00.607
It was used to turn
the lock alright,

30:00.609 --> 30:02.709
but it looks more like
a miniature screwdriver,

30:02.711 --> 30:05.646
like something you'd use
to change a watch battery.

30:05.648 --> 30:07.113
But what does all this mean?

30:07.115 --> 30:08.849
It means someone did
break into your house

30:08.851 --> 30:10.584
and steal your
mother's necklace.

30:10.586 --> 30:11.652
And it means...

30:11.654 --> 30:13.186
We have another clue.

30:13.188 --> 30:14.688
Now what?

30:14.690 --> 30:18.694
I'd like to learn more about
this pearl of great price.

30:26.935 --> 30:28.702
Oh no, no.

30:28.704 --> 30:30.270
Those are too expensive.

30:30.272 --> 30:31.805
This one is just dreadful.

30:31.807 --> 30:35.008
Can't you see that I'm a
woman of exquisite taste?

30:35.010 --> 30:37.744
Now show me something that's
worthy of my attention.

30:37.746 --> 30:40.148
Yes ma'am.

30:43.719 --> 30:46.019
That's Mr. Biggs, the owner.

30:51.359 --> 30:53.727
Ah, these, gosh darn it,

30:53.729 --> 30:55.496
these good for nothing toy...

30:55.498 --> 30:56.963
They break real
easy, don't they?

30:56.965 --> 30:57.966
Ah.

30:59.702 --> 31:00.534
Hey kid, what are ya doing?

31:00.536 --> 31:01.835
That's a Rolex!

31:01.837 --> 31:03.670
My father bought a
pearl necklace from you

31:03.672 --> 31:04.938
about a month ago.

31:04.940 --> 31:05.672
Yeah, so what?

31:05.674 --> 31:07.040
Your mommy didn't like it?

31:07.042 --> 31:09.876
Sorry sweetie, all
sales are final.

31:09.878 --> 31:11.545
Well that would
sort of difficult,

31:11.547 --> 31:13.480
seeing how the
necklace was stolen.

31:13.482 --> 31:15.248
Stolen, huh?

31:15.250 --> 31:17.017
Well I can't say I'm surprised.

31:17.019 --> 31:19.119
There've been a lotta
jewelry robberies lately.

31:19.121 --> 31:21.922
How would you know that
there's been robberies?

31:21.924 --> 31:24.858
I sell jewelry, it's
my business to know.

31:24.860 --> 31:26.793
Besides, every time
there's a new robbery

31:26.795 --> 31:28.829
the cops are in here
asking me questions

31:28.831 --> 31:30.831
as though I had
something to do with it.

31:30.833 --> 31:32.699
Ridiculous.

31:32.701 --> 31:34.434
But why would they think that?

31:34.436 --> 31:35.836
How would I know kid?

31:35.838 --> 31:38.639
Maybe because every
theft in the past year

31:38.641 --> 31:39.773
involved only jewelry.

31:39.775 --> 31:43.443
Jewelry that came from my store.

31:43.445 --> 31:44.978
Just like my house.

31:44.980 --> 31:46.747
Hey kid, do you know
what you're doing there?

31:46.749 --> 31:49.484
I think we're onto something.

31:51.086 --> 31:52.853
Do you have any
angry ex-employees

31:52.855 --> 31:55.255
or any other enemies who might
want to hurt your reputation?

31:55.257 --> 31:56.823
Do you have any drug
or alcohol problems?

31:56.825 --> 31:58.692
What about your gambling debt?

31:58.694 --> 32:00.228
Gambling, what?

32:01.764 --> 32:06.232
Look, I run a fair, honest
and profitable business here.

32:06.234 --> 32:08.501
I drive a Lexus for
crying out loud.

32:08.503 --> 32:10.837
Why would I need to steal?

32:10.839 --> 32:14.841
Kat, Kat, whatever you do, don't
let Mrs. Johnson leave here

32:14.843 --> 32:17.177
without buying
something expensive.

32:17.179 --> 32:18.781
Yes, Mr. Biggs.

32:21.249 --> 32:23.249
What about your employee?

32:23.251 --> 32:24.350
Kat?

32:24.352 --> 32:25.819
She's just a kid.

32:25.821 --> 32:27.721
Look, I'll tell ya
one thing though,

32:27.723 --> 32:30.857
whoever's pulling these
jobs is a real pro.

32:30.859 --> 32:33.760
Could you show us a pearl
necklace like the one you sold

32:33.762 --> 32:35.195
to Mary Beth's father?

32:35.197 --> 32:36.763
What's the name?

32:36.765 --> 32:38.732
Robert Anne is
my father's name.

32:38.734 --> 32:40.734
Oh yeah, I remember him.

32:40.736 --> 32:42.235
The guy with the little feet.

32:42.237 --> 32:44.738
Kat sold him a
string from the uh,

32:44.740 --> 32:46.172
the dainty clam collection.

32:46.174 --> 32:48.043
I got it right here.

32:52.114 --> 32:53.880
Now you guys be
careful with these.

32:53.882 --> 32:57.986
These ain't no glass beads
for playing dress up with.

32:59.922 --> 33:00.854
They're beautiful.

33:00.856 --> 33:02.589
See the single red pearl?

33:02.591 --> 33:03.857
My mother's was like that.

33:03.859 --> 33:05.158
Look at the price.

33:05.160 --> 33:07.861
No wonder someone's
been targeting jewelry.

33:07.863 --> 33:11.131
Now I'm telling you kids the
same thing I told the cops.

33:11.133 --> 33:15.702
I'm a business man and a
law abiding citizen, period.

33:15.704 --> 33:17.237
Besides, haven't you heard?

33:17.239 --> 33:18.972
They've already
caught the thief.

33:18.974 --> 33:21.107
You mean they caught the guy
that's been robbing people?

33:21.109 --> 33:22.676
Sure, nabbed him
just last night

33:22.678 --> 33:24.144
while he was robbing a house.

33:24.146 --> 33:26.512
Happened to be
right next to the donut shop.

33:26.514 --> 33:28.281
They've got him in jail
right now at this very moment

33:28.283 --> 33:29.850
while we speak.

33:29.852 --> 33:33.954
Now look, why don't you kids
take your little detective game

33:33.956 --> 33:36.389
or cops and robbers and
whatever it is you're playing

33:36.391 --> 33:39.225
down to the police station
and leave me alone!

33:39.227 --> 33:40.326
He's right.

33:40.328 --> 33:41.762
If they already caught the guy,

33:41.764 --> 33:43.329
then all we have to do
is get him to tell us

33:43.331 --> 33:44.798
where he hid the pearls.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.833
- I agree.
- Okay.

33:46.835 --> 33:49.137
Thanks for your time.

33:50.272 --> 33:51.073
Oh here.

33:55.277 --> 33:56.779
Hey, it works.

33:58.914 --> 34:00.613
Child's play.

34:00.615 --> 34:03.151
Hey kid, how'd ya do that?

34:06.889 --> 34:08.255
I'll be switched.

34:12.094 --> 34:13.726
Well he
wasn't very friendly.

34:13.728 --> 34:15.027
Judging by the rest of him,

34:15.030 --> 34:17.664
his shoe size must
be over 13 inches.

34:17.666 --> 34:19.099
So you think he's in on it?

34:19.101 --> 34:21.967
He's selling jewelry and
then stealing it right back?

34:21.969 --> 34:24.004
He would know just
which houses to rob.

34:24.005 --> 34:25.906
Yes, but he's a
successful businessman.

34:25.908 --> 34:28.408
Why steal jewelry and
risk going to jail?

34:28.409 --> 34:29.745
I don't know.

34:30.846 --> 34:33.782
Let's ask the
jewelry thief that.

35:00.208 --> 35:01.942
I don't think this
was a good idea.

35:01.944 --> 35:04.044
And I don't feel right about
you lying to get us in here,

35:04.046 --> 35:05.145
Ben Junk.

35:05.147 --> 35:06.612
Well do you think
they would've let us in

35:06.614 --> 35:07.781
if I hadn't told
'em that this guy

35:07.783 --> 35:10.152
was our long lost brother?

35:24.232 --> 35:25.768
Sit down G-Dog

35:31.073 --> 35:33.475
You say G-dog's your brother?

35:41.416 --> 35:42.250
Uh.

35:43.551 --> 35:45.453
You got five minutes.

36:02.670 --> 36:04.773
Um hello there Mr. G.

36:06.041 --> 36:08.809
Or do you prefer Dog?

36:08.811 --> 36:10.543
What you little kids want?

36:10.545 --> 36:13.013
Well, it's like this Mr. G.

36:13.015 --> 36:15.348
Mary here, she uh,
you stole the um,

36:15.350 --> 36:20.153
you see you took
without asking then uh...

36:20.155 --> 36:22.088
You took my mother's
beautiful pearl necklace,

36:22.090 --> 36:24.190
which was a gift from my father,
who's trying nothing more

36:24.192 --> 36:25.959
than to mend their
crumbling marriage.

36:25.961 --> 36:28.761
Not to mention the muddy boot
print you left on your way out

36:28.763 --> 36:29.830
and I want it back.

36:29.832 --> 36:31.164
What she said.

36:31.166 --> 36:34.300
The necklace we want
back, not the mud stain.

36:34.302 --> 36:35.601
I see, I see.

36:35.603 --> 36:40.340
So you think G-Dog's got
your mama's necklace, huh?

36:40.342 --> 36:42.275
Is there another
thief in this room?

36:42.277 --> 36:43.409
Never can tell.

36:43.411 --> 36:45.278
Even from birth, the
wicked go astray.

36:45.280 --> 36:48.014
From the womb they are
wayward and tell lies.

36:48.016 --> 36:49.682
Attention all guards,

36:49.684 --> 36:51.351
there is a riot in progress.

36:51.353 --> 36:53.253
Seal all exits.

36:53.255 --> 36:56.289
Yes well, regardless, we
need the pearl necklace back,

36:56.291 --> 36:57.423
immediately.

36:57.425 --> 36:59.059
Your failure to help
us in this matter

36:59.061 --> 37:01.461
will truly only add to
your list of misdeeds.

37:01.463 --> 37:03.396
And results in chastisement.

37:03.398 --> 37:04.931
What you call me?

37:04.933 --> 37:07.133
Please Mr. Dog, I don't
even care why you did it,

37:07.135 --> 37:09.002
but you see I have to
have the necklace back

37:09.004 --> 37:10.438
before tomorrow morning

37:11.806 --> 37:13.106
before my parents sign
the divorce papers

37:13.108 --> 37:15.608
so please, please,
won't you help us?

37:15.610 --> 37:16.979
Divorce huh?

37:17.880 --> 37:20.146
I'm just a two-bit thief.

37:20.148 --> 37:21.882
Not a home wrecker.

37:21.884 --> 37:23.416
What's the necklace look like?

37:23.418 --> 37:27.053
16 inch hand nod yellow
gold clasp, a single strand,

37:27.055 --> 37:29.990
natural 6.5 millimeter
white pearls.

37:29.992 --> 37:32.658
I been a thief about as
long as I can remember.

37:32.660 --> 37:35.228
You know I don't even
know why I do it.

37:35.230 --> 37:37.130
I can remember
everything I've stolen.

37:37.132 --> 37:39.432
Like a list of my sins
that won't let me be.

37:39.434 --> 37:41.501
But the truth is I don't
even know why I do it.

37:41.503 --> 37:45.005
The truth is that most of the
time I don't even wanna do it.

37:45.007 --> 37:46.539
So I'm telling you
the truth little lady,

37:46.541 --> 37:49.109
I ain't got your
mother's necklace.

37:49.111 --> 37:51.644
Well if you didn't
steal it, then who did?

37:51.646 --> 37:53.513
Yeah, we want some answers G.

37:53.515 --> 37:54.547
Answers?

37:54.549 --> 37:55.949
Yeah, we all want them.

37:55.951 --> 37:56.919
Don't we?

37:58.186 --> 38:00.186
But understand this, if
the owner of the house knew

38:00.188 --> 38:03.089
what hour the thief was coming,

38:03.091 --> 38:05.525
he woulda not let the
house been broken in to.

38:05.527 --> 38:08.061
You also must be ready,
because the son of man

38:08.063 --> 38:12.265
will come in the house
when you least expect it.

38:12.267 --> 38:13.967
What does that mean?

38:13.969 --> 38:15.468
I don't know.

38:15.470 --> 38:17.537
It's just something here that
I read in this here Bible

38:17.539 --> 38:18.972
that I found in my cell.

38:18.974 --> 38:21.241
I just thought at the
moment in our conversation,

38:21.243 --> 38:24.377
I should say something
encouraging to ya'll.

38:24.379 --> 38:25.380
Thank you.

38:26.181 --> 38:28.650
Time's up G-Dog

38:30.285 --> 38:31.784
All
guards report to...

38:31.786 --> 38:34.854
Mr. Dog, thank you for being
honest about the necklace.

38:34.856 --> 38:36.522
Now you kids to me a favor.

38:36.524 --> 38:39.425
If you guys get any
answers, any answers,

38:39.427 --> 38:43.331
just come back and let
me know, would you?

38:44.899 --> 38:46.434
Yeah, we will.

38:51.139 --> 38:54.807
Time to go
back to the dog house.

38:54.809 --> 38:57.843
I'm sorry Mary Beth, but I
don't know what to do next.

38:57.845 --> 38:59.545
I'm afraid I don't either.

38:59.547 --> 39:01.281
Perhaps we could
speak with your pastor

39:01.283 --> 39:05.185
and see if there isn't something
besides the pearl necklace

39:05.187 --> 39:07.253
that could save your
parents' marriage.

39:07.255 --> 39:09.022
He and his wife
went to Mexico.

39:09.024 --> 39:12.758
Something about setting
the captives free.

39:12.760 --> 39:15.728
Wow, a pastor and a soldier.

39:15.730 --> 39:19.099
I didn't know we were
at war with Mexico.

39:19.101 --> 39:21.167
Finally a tough
guy in this story.

39:21.169 --> 39:23.203
I bet he came back and
pummeled you two, you right?

39:23.205 --> 39:24.270
That would be highly unlikely

39:24.272 --> 39:25.771
due to his state of confinement.

39:25.773 --> 39:27.540
Well he can't just
go back to his cell.

39:27.542 --> 39:29.809
He is the hero in
this story, right?

39:29.811 --> 39:33.579
I might point out, that
he's the one behind the bars.

39:33.581 --> 39:35.915
Oh yeah, so it's
hopeless then.

39:35.917 --> 39:37.717
No one is hopeless to God.

39:37.719 --> 39:39.252
Marty might be.

39:39.254 --> 39:40.953
What'd you say squirt?

39:40.955 --> 39:43.256
Um, I said, um I said,

39:43.258 --> 39:45.660
I wish we had a party teepee.

39:47.095 --> 39:49.195
So then G-Dog was
of no assistance then?

39:49.197 --> 39:51.497
He did help, just not in
the way that we had hoped.

39:51.499 --> 39:54.034
Yeah, G-Dog's heart
was getting pretty tender

39:54.036 --> 39:55.701
and causing him to
think of things he did,

39:55.703 --> 39:59.272
which in turn caused us to
think of things we did too.

40:03.545 --> 40:04.610
My apologies.

40:04.612 --> 40:06.412
This camping affair
has caused me

40:06.414 --> 40:08.348
to procure a large appetite.

40:08.350 --> 40:10.550
Yeah, I suppose we
should think about supper.

40:10.552 --> 40:11.517
What'd you bring?

40:11.519 --> 40:12.418
Bring?

40:12.420 --> 40:13.586
You know, to eat.

40:13.588 --> 40:16.289
Ah, I knew I was
forgetting something.

40:16.291 --> 40:17.790
Aw dang it.

40:17.792 --> 40:20.126
Eh, look at where we are.

40:20.128 --> 40:23.896
There's bound to be
something around here to eat.

40:23.898 --> 40:25.700
Squirrels, bluejays.

40:27.035 --> 40:27.735
Treebark.

40:29.304 --> 40:32.838
If we take into consideration
the proper calorie intake

40:32.840 --> 40:35.041
this bio diverse environment,...

40:35.043 --> 40:36.509
Stanley!

40:36.511 --> 40:39.345
Look, all we gotta do is
catch something and cook it.

40:39.347 --> 40:41.281
What do you suggest
we use as a trap?

40:41.283 --> 40:43.149
I have some fishing
line in my pack.

40:43.151 --> 40:44.717
A lotta good that'll do.

40:44.719 --> 40:46.621
You gonna lasso a fish?

40:54.262 --> 40:55.763
Would this work?

40:57.532 --> 40:58.964
Yeah.

40:58.966 --> 41:01.000
- Marty.
- I didn't do it.

41:01.002 --> 41:02.368
I was going to ask you

41:02.370 --> 41:04.604
if you would like be
the hunter-gatherer.

41:04.606 --> 41:06.106
Hunter what?

41:06.108 --> 41:07.373
Can we just go catch us a fish

41:07.375 --> 41:09.275
before we all starve to death?

41:09.277 --> 41:11.411
You trust me with that?

41:11.413 --> 41:14.647
I for one would vote you
most likely to kill something.

41:14.649 --> 41:15.483
Thanks.

41:47.582 --> 41:48.550
Any bites?

41:49.784 --> 41:53.085
Nah, maybe I should
make a spear or something.

41:53.087 --> 41:54.720
Could be winds from the north.

41:54.722 --> 41:56.055
Huh?

41:56.057 --> 41:58.291
You know, wind's from the
north, they won't come forth.

41:58.293 --> 42:02.128
If the wind's from the
east, they bite the least.

42:02.130 --> 42:04.230
I was thinking about G-Dog.

42:04.232 --> 42:06.832
Does being tough always
get you into trouble?

42:06.834 --> 42:08.634
It wasn't that he was tough,

42:08.636 --> 42:12.438
it was that he used his toughness
to do the wrong things.

42:12.440 --> 42:14.106
But being tough protects you.

42:14.108 --> 42:15.608
Tough people still
get hurt Marty.

42:15.610 --> 42:18.578
Toughness and strength
are two different things.

42:18.580 --> 42:21.481
Jesus is the strongest
person I know.

42:21.483 --> 42:24.217
But yet he was called
the lamb of God.

42:24.219 --> 42:25.518
But if he was so strong,

42:25.520 --> 42:28.588
then why did he let
people hurt him?

42:28.590 --> 42:30.890
Nah, he should've just
looked out for himself

42:30.892 --> 42:32.358
and he'd have been fine.

42:32.360 --> 42:34.327
It's his gentleness,
not his toughness,

42:34.329 --> 42:36.864
that cause people to change.

42:38.333 --> 42:40.700
I wasn't always like
I am now, you know.

42:40.702 --> 42:43.436
Being tough, I don't
get hurt that way.

42:43.438 --> 42:44.837
But what you don't see Marty,

42:44.839 --> 42:47.607
is that you're hurting
everyone around you.

42:47.609 --> 42:50.476
But if I wasn't the
tough guy anymore,

42:50.478 --> 42:52.380
I don't know who I'd be.

42:53.748 --> 42:56.549
You'd be one step closer to
the guy God wants you to be.

42:56.551 --> 42:58.484
The guy God wants me to be?

42:58.486 --> 43:01.454
You're saying God wants
me to walk the line?

43:01.456 --> 43:04.190
Yeah and I want ya
to pull the line too.

43:04.192 --> 43:05.491
Pull the line?

43:05.493 --> 43:07.327
Yeah, pull it
in, you got a bite.

43:07.329 --> 43:08.294
What?

43:08.296 --> 43:09.595
Hey look, I really got one.

43:16.238 --> 43:17.703
Looking good Stanley.

43:17.705 --> 43:20.306
I can't believe that mongoid
actually caught a fish.

43:20.308 --> 43:21.674
He said the wind
was from the south.

43:21.676 --> 43:22.908
The wind?

43:22.910 --> 43:24.109
From the south they
bite with their mouth.

43:24.111 --> 43:25.044
From the west...

43:25.046 --> 43:26.546
They bite the best.

43:26.548 --> 43:29.715
An educated deduction,
though not very scientific.

43:29.717 --> 43:33.921
No, but a little fun
never hurt anyone, right?

43:37.625 --> 43:40.428
So Stanley, why are you here?

43:41.663 --> 43:45.698
I mean, isn't my brother's
camp for kids who, who...

43:45.700 --> 43:48.801
My mom said the
interaction with others

43:48.803 --> 43:51.070
in a Christian environment would
be beneficial to my growth.

43:51.072 --> 43:52.672
Hasn't proven true.

43:52.674 --> 43:54.440
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

43:54.442 --> 43:57.510
but maybe you need to give this
camping idea more of a try.

43:57.512 --> 43:58.844
Ben mentioned that you've won

43:58.846 --> 44:01.481
every science fair
since Kindergarten.

44:01.483 --> 44:03.583
I would think that somebody
of your intelligence

44:03.585 --> 44:07.653
would understand that this
sort of primal creteness

44:07.655 --> 44:09.989
adventures is just
a waste of time.

44:09.991 --> 44:11.324
Science is great Stanley,

44:11.326 --> 44:13.025
but it's not the only
way to learn new things.

44:13.027 --> 44:15.295
Surely this place
doesn't hold any lessons.

44:15.297 --> 44:17.029
I don't know, it's
already taught Marty

44:17.031 --> 44:18.531
how useful he can be.

44:18.533 --> 44:20.065
It's just a fish.

44:20.067 --> 44:21.701
Yes and when we eat his fish,

44:21.703 --> 44:24.504
we will learn gratitude that
we have something to eat.

44:24.506 --> 44:26.238
I'd rather be home
in my laboratory

44:26.240 --> 44:28.508
learning important
scientific facts.

44:28.510 --> 44:32.712
What about the trees and
the river and the animals?

44:32.714 --> 44:36.382
I don't know, maybe we could
learn something from them.

44:36.384 --> 44:40.185
All simply the result
of time and chance.

44:40.187 --> 44:41.521
As are we.

44:41.523 --> 44:42.622
You don't really
believe that do you?

44:42.624 --> 44:44.557
Evolution is the foundation

44:44.559 --> 44:48.594
of any reasoning
scientific mind.

44:48.596 --> 44:50.195
I noticed the
map you were making

44:50.197 --> 44:51.697
the leaves when I arrived.

44:51.699 --> 44:55.034
A bit crude, but most
helpful in plotting our course.

44:55.036 --> 44:56.536
What do you think
the next person

44:56.538 --> 44:58.471
who comes across
your map will think?

44:58.473 --> 45:00.606
I surmise that they'll
see and appreciate

45:00.608 --> 45:02.642
my proper intellect
of preparedness.

45:02.644 --> 45:04.877
You don't think they'll just
see some sticks and leaves

45:04.879 --> 45:07.246
and assume they fell
on the ground that way?

45:07.248 --> 45:08.581
Just fell that way?

45:08.583 --> 45:10.049
Anybody with a reasoning
mind could clearly see

45:10.051 --> 45:11.651
that they were placed
there on purpose.

45:11.653 --> 45:12.952
So you think they would assume

45:12.954 --> 45:14.219
that there was a
creator who made it?

45:14.221 --> 45:15.755
Of course.

45:15.757 --> 45:17.957
A creation that not even
time or chance could have made?

45:17.959 --> 45:20.428
Absurd, not in a million.

45:22.664 --> 45:24.897
Stanley, think about
everything you know

45:24.899 --> 45:27.600
about the intricate
workings of life.

45:27.602 --> 45:29.234
And the whole universe.

45:29.236 --> 45:32.505
How everything works with
such precision and purpose.

45:32.507 --> 45:36.075
And those are just some
sticks on the ground.

45:36.077 --> 45:41.947
I admit your conjecture is
valid, quite valid actually.

45:41.949 --> 45:44.049
Stanley, anyone
coming upon your map

45:44.051 --> 45:46.018
would have to combine
their reasoning mind

45:46.020 --> 45:47.520
and one other thing though.

45:47.522 --> 45:48.788
What's that?

45:48.790 --> 45:49.855
Faith.

45:49.857 --> 45:51.023
Faith?

45:51.025 --> 45:52.492
They would only be
seeing the creation,

45:52.494 --> 45:53.793
so they would naturally
have to have faith

45:53.795 --> 45:57.497
that there was a
creator who made it.

45:57.499 --> 45:59.899
I believe you're right.

45:59.901 --> 46:01.667
I have faith?

46:01.669 --> 46:03.703
Huh, I have faith.

46:03.705 --> 46:05.004
And you're about to
have something else.

46:05.006 --> 46:06.406
What's that.

46:06.408 --> 46:07.773
Burnt fish, quick,
get 'em off the fire.

46:07.775 --> 46:08.576
Oh yeah.

46:13.448 --> 46:15.648
This looks good Stanley.

46:15.650 --> 46:17.450
Thanks, Cricket assisted me.

46:17.452 --> 46:19.552
Glad he wasn't
cooking hamburgers.

46:19.554 --> 46:21.220
Hamburgers?

46:21.222 --> 46:22.688
Nevermind.

46:22.690 --> 46:25.190
I think before we eat,
we should give thanks.

46:25.192 --> 46:27.729
Who wants to say the prayer?

46:30.498 --> 46:31.533
Okay.

46:32.900 --> 46:36.502
God, thank you for providing
us some food to eat

46:36.504 --> 46:38.103
- and thank you...
- And God, thank you

46:38.105 --> 46:40.642
for helping me catch a fish.

46:45.212 --> 46:46.047
What?

46:47.815 --> 46:49.515
And God thank
you for bringing us

46:49.517 --> 46:51.451
all on this camping
trip together.

46:51.453 --> 46:52.284
Amen.

46:59.461 --> 47:01.561
Just ignore Ben's
comment about my cooking.

47:01.563 --> 47:03.596
My burgers weren't that bad.

47:03.598 --> 47:06.799
Yeah, if you don't
mind eatin' hockey pucks.

47:06.801 --> 47:09.034
Mary was pretty
down at that point.

47:09.036 --> 47:12.106
And we, well, we
were out of ideas.

47:24.752 --> 47:26.686
Think she's gonna be alright?

47:26.688 --> 47:28.588
Time can heal any wound.

47:28.590 --> 47:29.555
That's comforting.

47:29.557 --> 47:30.690
You think that up yourself?

47:30.692 --> 47:32.725
If you recall,
I wasn't the one

47:32.727 --> 47:36.195
who wanted to get
involved in this, stuff.

47:36.197 --> 47:38.831
Well this stuff
is a girl's family,

47:38.833 --> 47:41.066
which is about to be
torn apart forever.

47:41.068 --> 47:43.536
You know if you looked for
clues as much as you complain,

47:43.538 --> 47:44.970
we would've had it fixed.

47:44.972 --> 47:47.607
Don't you dare
try to blame me.

47:47.609 --> 47:48.641
Who else is there to blame?

47:48.643 --> 47:50.175
Yourself.

47:50.177 --> 47:52.011
I'm sick and tired of you
thinking you know everything.

47:52.013 --> 47:53.813
The fact that you don't
know I know everything

47:53.815 --> 47:55.681
proves that you don't
know everything.

47:55.683 --> 47:56.682
Well that's dumb.

47:56.684 --> 47:58.017
That doesn't even make sense.

47:58.019 --> 47:59.619
Well I
do know everything.

47:59.621 --> 48:00.886
Ben: Not everything.

48:00.888 --> 48:02.522
I don't like you
trying to act like

48:02.524 --> 48:03.455
you know everything.

48:03.457 --> 48:04.824
I'm pretty smart too.

48:04.826 --> 48:06.959
You don't know
that I know everything

48:06.961 --> 48:08.327
proves that you...

48:08.329 --> 48:12.567
Dear
God, I really need your help.

48:15.537 --> 48:16.969
I know you don't like divorce.

48:16.971 --> 48:19.672
And I know if I could
just find the necklace

48:19.674 --> 48:22.341
that I could save my
parents from breaking up.

48:22.343 --> 48:23.743
You're dumb.

48:23.745 --> 48:24.744
The fact that you
don't understand that

48:24.746 --> 48:26.579
means that you're dumb.

48:29.684 --> 48:31.016
MARY BETH'S
VOICEOVER: Please God,

48:31.018 --> 48:33.686
use the Jungle Junkboys
to find the necklace.

48:33.688 --> 48:35.955
They're the smartest
boys I know.

48:35.957 --> 48:38.891
But even they could
use your help.

48:38.893 --> 48:40.926
The fact
that, the fact that...

48:40.928 --> 48:42.327
A lot of your help.

48:42.329 --> 48:44.764
Please show 'em what to do.

48:44.766 --> 48:47.068
The fact that, the fact...

48:50.437 --> 48:51.873
You're weird.

49:00.414 --> 49:02.183
We made this for you.

49:03.517 --> 49:05.084
What is it?

49:05.086 --> 49:08.187
Well they were burgers before
wingnut here distracted me.

49:08.189 --> 49:11.156
So now you burning the
food is my fault too?

49:11.158 --> 49:12.224
Well if you hadn't...

49:12.226 --> 49:13.793
I'm not very hungry.

49:13.795 --> 49:16.631
I should be getting home now.

49:21.636 --> 49:24.604
I lied about having the money.

49:24.606 --> 49:27.074
We didn't even fix anything.

49:33.480 --> 49:34.880
Now look what you've done.

49:34.882 --> 49:38.450
I knew we should have
gotten the steak out.

49:38.452 --> 49:39.384
What?

49:39.386 --> 49:40.653
To grill.

49:40.655 --> 49:42.755
We should've gotten
the steak out.

49:42.757 --> 49:44.959
Cricket, you're a genius!

49:46.093 --> 49:49.330
Yeah, but hey,
what about the food?

49:52.066 --> 49:52.900
Wait up!

49:55.302 --> 49:56.636
I don't get it.

49:56.638 --> 49:59.304
Why did Mary Beth
apologize for lying?

49:59.306 --> 50:00.873
What's the big deal?

50:00.875 --> 50:03.108
She said she would
pay us for helping.

50:03.110 --> 50:05.110
Even though we woulda
done it for nothing.

50:05.112 --> 50:07.146
And there aren't any
color shades to a lie.

50:07.148 --> 50:09.915
A lie's a lie, no matter
how small it seems.

50:09.917 --> 50:12.284
Maybe she thought
no one would help her

50:12.286 --> 50:14.654
if she didn't pay them.

50:14.656 --> 50:17.522
Maybe she though no one
would care about her

50:17.524 --> 50:19.058
if she didn't lie.

50:19.060 --> 50:22.828
Lying to make people care
seems like you're just saying

50:22.830 --> 50:25.397
that I'm not good
enough the way I am.

50:25.399 --> 50:26.932
Maybe I'm not.

50:26.934 --> 50:29.635
If we're trying to be all
that God wants us to be,

50:29.637 --> 50:31.303
then that's enough.

50:31.305 --> 50:32.504
I agree.

50:32.506 --> 50:34.406
Yeah, that makes sense.

50:34.408 --> 50:38.010
I believe I would also have
to concur with that statement.

50:38.012 --> 50:38.813
Me too.

50:39.747 --> 50:42.183
So, what's next in the story?

50:43.317 --> 50:44.283
The stakeout.

50:44.285 --> 50:45.651
You're grilling steak now?

50:45.653 --> 50:47.753
But I thought you
just grilled burgers.

50:47.755 --> 50:49.955
I believe that he's
referring to the act

50:49.957 --> 50:53.492
of covertly observing
a person or persons.

50:53.494 --> 50:54.559
Huh?

50:54.561 --> 50:56.228
Spying.

50:56.230 --> 50:57.196
Oh.

50:59.934 --> 51:02.367
Yeah, you see I
got this brilliant idea.

51:02.369 --> 51:03.736
Your idea?

51:03.738 --> 51:05.070
Fine, you helped.

51:05.072 --> 51:07.106
He's been in
there a long time.

51:07.108 --> 51:08.573
It's probably the first time

51:08.575 --> 51:11.510
he's ever been in
a jewelry store.

51:11.512 --> 51:16.215
We realized that to catch
the thief we needed bait.

51:18.452 --> 51:21.286
No not
that one, the pearls.

51:21.288 --> 51:22.722
Cook?

51:22.724 --> 51:23.991
The pearls.

51:24.859 --> 51:27.026
Whirls, curls?

51:27.028 --> 51:28.127
Pearls.

51:28.129 --> 51:29.230
Pearl, pearls.

51:30.998 --> 51:33.465
Pearls, pearls is what I meant.

51:33.467 --> 51:35.100
I need some pearls.

51:35.102 --> 51:37.772
That's what I need, pearls.

51:43.745 --> 51:45.044
What are you doing?

51:45.046 --> 51:46.545
Chillax, I'm just
fixing my hair.

51:46.547 --> 51:48.149
Get ya down here!

51:51.886 --> 51:53.886
These are our most
exquisite pearls

51:53.888 --> 51:57.024
from our Tsunami
Wave collection.

51:58.692 --> 52:00.192
Those would look
exquisite on me,

52:00.194 --> 52:03.028
I mean your lady
friend of course.

52:03.030 --> 52:06.732
Old Darlene
wouldn't be caught dead

52:06.734 --> 52:10.135
with these marbles
around her neck.

52:10.137 --> 52:15.274
Oh I mean these are for my
daughter that I wish I had.

52:15.276 --> 52:16.443
I'll take 'em.

52:21.749 --> 52:23.182
Great job Uncle Jim.

52:23.184 --> 52:25.250
I've never been so
uncomfortable in all my life

52:25.252 --> 52:26.919
with all those fancy
things in there.

52:26.921 --> 52:30.055
You boys realize how much
money I spent in that place?

52:30.057 --> 52:31.991
Don't worry Uncle Jim,
we'll return the pearls

52:31.993 --> 52:34.493
and your money as soon
as we catch the thief.

52:34.495 --> 52:37.062
You gave 'em the
junkyard's address, right?

52:37.064 --> 52:38.931
What makes you boys
so sure that jewel thief

52:38.933 --> 52:41.066
is gonna be come
lookin' for them pearls?

52:41.068 --> 52:43.235
Oh he'll try to
steal them for certain.

52:43.237 --> 52:45.270
And when he does,
we'll be waiting

52:45.272 --> 52:48.843
like two horsies and
night centennals.

53:34.889 --> 53:36.488
Use the
torque wrench!

53:36.490 --> 53:38.190
Oh, my turn to watch already?

53:38.192 --> 53:40.192
Yeah, but I better stay
up with you just in case

53:40.194 --> 53:41.861
you can't stay awake.

53:41.863 --> 53:44.096
Thanks, but between
the dozen motion sensors,

53:44.098 --> 53:46.065
the half a dozen car alarms

53:46.067 --> 53:48.600
and the 25 flood lights
I've got wired up,

53:48.602 --> 53:52.872
nobody's going to walk through
this place unannounced.

53:55.977 --> 53:59.078
Don't you think that maybe
your jewelry this way signs

53:59.080 --> 54:02.014
are a little too, I
don't know, obvious.

54:02.016 --> 54:05.317
We want the thief to try
to steal the pearls don't we?

54:05.319 --> 54:06.285
Cocoa?

54:06.287 --> 54:07.254
No thanks.

54:17.198 --> 54:19.131
Mary Beth talks
about God a lot.

54:19.133 --> 54:21.600
Everybody needs
something to believe in.

54:21.602 --> 54:22.868
What do we believe in?

54:22.870 --> 54:24.736
Mechanical
engineering of course.

54:24.738 --> 54:26.038
What do you think G-Dog meant

54:26.040 --> 54:28.173
by how we need to be
ready for the son of God

54:28.175 --> 54:29.841
to return like a thief.

54:29.843 --> 54:31.310
The ravings of
a desperate man.

54:31.312 --> 54:34.146
You see Ben, the average
non-mechanical person

54:34.148 --> 54:36.015
needs a God to help
them fix things.

54:36.017 --> 54:39.118
Their car breaks down,
they pray to God to fix it.

54:39.120 --> 54:42.121
They lose their job, they
pray to God for another job.

54:42.123 --> 54:45.224
They get locked up in jail,
they cling to God and so on.

54:45.226 --> 54:47.192
And then there's people like us.

54:47.194 --> 54:50.362
If something of ours breaks,
we simply fix it ourselves.

54:50.364 --> 54:52.364
Thereby cutting
out the middle man.

54:52.366 --> 54:54.033
So because we
know how to rebuild

54:54.035 --> 54:57.402
a four speed transmission,
we don't need God?

54:57.404 --> 54:58.405
Precisely.

55:14.655 --> 55:16.021
What about when we die?

55:16.023 --> 55:17.957
Then how is our mechanical
skills gonna help?

55:17.959 --> 55:19.358
Die?

55:19.360 --> 55:22.161
We're just kids, with our
whole lives ahead of us.

55:22.163 --> 55:24.196
And by the time we're old
I wouldn't be surprised

55:24.198 --> 55:27.599
if medical science can't
keep us alive forever.

55:27.601 --> 55:29.201
I'm just not
so sure that medicine

55:29.203 --> 55:31.536
will be able to keep
people alive forever.

55:31.538 --> 55:32.837
That's all.

55:32.839 --> 55:34.239
Well maybe if you
read the science journal

55:34.241 --> 55:37.176
once in a while, instead
of your hot rod magazines,

55:37.178 --> 55:40.445
you'd know what I'm
saying is feasible.

55:40.447 --> 55:41.315
Yeah maybe.

55:45.286 --> 55:46.818
Are you sure you wired
everything up right?

55:46.820 --> 55:48.187
It's awful quiet.

55:48.189 --> 55:50.189
Maybe the robber
isn't coming tonight.

55:50.191 --> 55:51.290
He has to come tonight.

55:51.292 --> 55:52.557
Mary's parents are signing

55:52.559 --> 55:54.226
the divorce papers
in the morning.

55:54.228 --> 55:55.560
Just check your wires again.

55:55.562 --> 55:58.230
I don't need to recheck
my work, thank you.

55:58.232 --> 55:59.864
Yeah well just
check 'em anyways.

55:59.866 --> 56:02.234
Stop questioning my abilities.

56:02.236 --> 56:04.136
I'm not questioning
your darn abilities.

56:04.138 --> 56:06.738
I just wanna make sure the
wires are hooked up right.

56:06.740 --> 56:08.140
Stop pulling Ben.

56:08.142 --> 56:09.074
You stop pulling.

56:09.076 --> 56:09.975
Stop pulling.

56:09.977 --> 56:11.043
You stop pulling.

56:13.280 --> 56:16.081
Oh no, not my computer!

56:16.083 --> 56:17.182
Look what you've done.

56:17.184 --> 56:19.351
I'm so sorry he hurt you Spock.

56:19.353 --> 56:20.285
Spock?

56:20.287 --> 56:22.287
Don't speak to me right now.

56:22.289 --> 56:24.156
We don't need your
fancy computer anyways.

56:24.158 --> 56:25.690
It's not like
someone's gonna walk up

56:25.692 --> 56:30.097
and steal the pearls right
from under our noses.

57:12.373 --> 57:13.772
Come on Cricket, hurry up.

57:13.774 --> 57:15.340
How can you even see
where you're going?

57:15.342 --> 57:16.941
Are you kidding?

57:16.943 --> 57:21.213
I know this place like
the back of my hand!

57:38.465 --> 57:39.466
It's you!

57:41.034 --> 57:43.504
You have really big feet.

57:45.206 --> 57:47.774
We want the pearls back, now!

58:03.924 --> 58:06.227
♪ Darlene

58:06.927 --> 58:09.594
♪ Darlene, Dar

58:09.596 --> 58:11.196
♪ Darlene

58:11.198 --> 58:13.234
Cricket, get off me.

58:17.604 --> 58:19.037
What happened?

58:19.039 --> 58:20.372
Where are we?

58:20.374 --> 58:22.374
In the back garage I think.

58:24.145 --> 58:25.344
Morning boys.

58:25.346 --> 58:27.212
Uncle Jim, what's going on?

58:27.214 --> 58:29.214
That's actually
kind of a funny story.

58:29.216 --> 58:30.615
Be glad to tell
you boys about it,

58:30.617 --> 58:32.751
as soon as the police
comes to pick up the thief.

58:32.753 --> 58:34.453
The thief, you
mean you caught him?

58:34.455 --> 58:35.954
Eh, I kinda figured you boys

58:35.956 --> 58:37.356
might need a little
help last night.

58:37.358 --> 58:41.495
But if by him you're
referring to the jewel thief,

58:59.079 --> 59:01.215
you'd be badly mistaken.

59:02.015 --> 59:03.382
How'd ya like that last song?

59:03.384 --> 59:05.617
That's the lady from
the jewelry store.

59:05.619 --> 59:06.318
Kat.

59:06.320 --> 59:07.452
Is that her name?

59:07.454 --> 59:09.053
I was calling her big foot.

59:09.055 --> 59:10.989
She might be a
woman here fellas,

59:10.991 --> 59:12.357
but she ain't no lady.

59:12.359 --> 59:14.693
And she's a real
firecracker at that.

59:14.695 --> 59:19.198
You gonna play real
nice now ain't ya?

59:19.200 --> 59:20.599
Get away from me
you filthy mechanic.

59:20.601 --> 59:22.033
You can't treat me like this.

59:22.035 --> 59:23.535
You've got nothing on me.

59:23.537 --> 59:24.169
Nothing.

59:24.171 --> 59:25.136
Nothing?

59:25.138 --> 59:26.070
We saw you steal the pearls

59:26.072 --> 59:27.472
right from in front of us.

59:27.474 --> 59:31.378
Well technically we
didn't see anything.

59:33.547 --> 59:35.414
You mean you boys
didn't see her steal it?

59:35.416 --> 59:36.548
So what, she stole it,

59:36.550 --> 59:38.483
just check her pockets.

59:38.485 --> 59:40.852
Uh, already done that.

59:40.854 --> 59:41.953
Empty.

59:43.390 --> 59:46.325
You silly, silly
little people.

59:46.327 --> 59:47.359
But you were in our junkyard.

59:47.361 --> 59:49.093
That's trespassing.

59:49.095 --> 59:50.128
But I was just looking for

59:50.130 --> 59:51.563
a new bumper for my car officer,

59:51.565 --> 59:54.999
when it got dark and these
hooligans attacked me

59:55.001 --> 59:56.668
and bound me and that big one

59:56.670 --> 01:00:00.739
even tortured me with hours
of this awful singing.

01:00:02.443 --> 01:00:06.811
I'm gonna sue you for
everything you've got.

01:00:06.813 --> 01:00:07.581
Uh boys.

01:00:08.515 --> 01:00:10.215
I'm no attorney at law here,

01:00:10.217 --> 01:00:12.417
but maybe she's onto something.

01:00:12.419 --> 01:00:13.785
Except for the
singing of course.

01:00:13.787 --> 01:00:15.620
And besides the suing,
who's gonna pay me back

01:00:15.622 --> 01:00:17.622
for the money I spent
out on them pearls?

01:00:17.624 --> 01:00:20.492
She must've hidden them
somewhere in the yard.

01:00:20.494 --> 01:00:23.462
Now you listen to me
you, you cat burglar.

01:00:23.464 --> 01:00:25.697
We want the pearl necklace
back you stole from us

01:00:25.699 --> 01:00:27.266
and we especially want
the pearl necklace

01:00:27.268 --> 01:00:28.833
you stole from
Mary Beth's house.

01:00:28.835 --> 01:00:30.604
And we want them now.

01:00:31.938 --> 01:00:33.705
You know what I want?

01:00:33.707 --> 01:00:34.939
Breakfast.

01:00:34.941 --> 01:00:36.007
Why you despicable...

01:00:36.009 --> 01:00:38.076
Whoa pal, whoa little buddy.

01:00:38.078 --> 01:00:39.578
I know my rights.

01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:42.947
How 'bout exercising
your rights by being quiet.

01:00:42.949 --> 01:00:43.784
No, no.

01:00:46.186 --> 01:00:47.488
Ben, come here.

01:00:48.589 --> 01:00:50.121
What are we
gonna do Uncle Jim?

01:00:50.123 --> 01:00:52.791
If she sues us, she could
take the whole junkyard away.

01:00:52.793 --> 01:00:54.293
I think what we
need to do right now

01:00:54.295 --> 01:00:55.760
at this time is to
go out in the yard

01:00:55.762 --> 01:00:58.397
and see if we can find where
she mighta hid the pearls.

01:00:58.399 --> 01:00:59.331
That way we'll have
enough evidence on her

01:00:59.333 --> 01:01:00.665
to have her locked up.

01:01:00.667 --> 01:01:03.335
Yeah okay, what do
you think Cricket?

01:01:03.337 --> 01:01:07.472
I think Cricket has a
quicker way in mind.

01:01:07.474 --> 01:01:08.940
Whoa little buddy.

01:01:08.942 --> 01:01:10.809
Sauteing the girl ain't gonna
do us no good right now.

01:01:10.811 --> 01:01:12.777
She knows where they
are Uncle Jim, she knows.

01:01:12.779 --> 01:01:15.514
Mary Beth's parents are gonna
give a divorce because of her.

01:01:15.516 --> 01:01:17.081
It's gonna be okay Cricket.

01:01:17.083 --> 01:01:19.384
You really care, don't you?

01:01:22.055 --> 01:01:23.588
Well it'll be alright.

01:01:23.590 --> 01:01:25.624
Well, there's only
one thing we can do.

01:01:25.626 --> 01:01:28.259
And that's go out and look
for where she hid the pearls.

01:01:28.261 --> 01:01:30.895
You're right Ben, I know we
can find where she hid them.

01:01:30.897 --> 01:01:32.631
- Boys...
- Then she'll have to tell us

01:01:32.633 --> 01:01:34.232
where she hid Mary
Beth's pearls.

01:01:34.234 --> 01:01:35.033
Boys!

01:01:35.035 --> 01:01:36.468
What is it?

01:01:36.470 --> 01:01:38.036
There's something more
important we got to do here.

01:01:38.038 --> 01:01:39.571
There's no time!

01:01:39.573 --> 01:01:42.307
Do we still have that fire
extinguisher here somewhere?

01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:44.476
Fire extinguisher?

01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:51.275
This'll do it.

01:02:51.277 --> 01:02:54.681
I don't think we
should throw that one.

01:02:57.451 --> 01:02:59.350
What are you guys doing?

01:02:59.352 --> 01:03:00.819
Why were you crying?

01:03:00.821 --> 01:03:04.856
Because my mom's leaving
to sign the divorce papers.

01:03:06.026 --> 01:03:07.861
Maybe these'll help.

01:03:24.878 --> 01:03:25.710
Look Mom.

01:03:25.712 --> 01:03:27.245
Mom, I found the pearls.

01:03:27.247 --> 01:03:29.082
Now you can stay home!

01:03:33.954 --> 01:03:34.886
She made it!

01:03:34.888 --> 01:03:35.922
Hot dog!

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:41.795
Honey, I gotta go.

01:03:52.639 --> 01:03:54.372
What are they doing?

01:03:54.374 --> 01:03:55.408
What?

01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:00.947
No, come back.

01:04:17.598 --> 01:04:19.063
She's gonna do it anyway?

01:04:19.065 --> 01:04:21.566
All that work finding
those pearls for nothing?

01:04:21.568 --> 01:04:23.334
That was the most
depressing story

01:04:23.336 --> 01:04:24.569
I've ever heard.

01:04:24.571 --> 01:04:26.004
Well it's not quite finished.

01:04:26.006 --> 01:04:28.272
Your story's dismal
conclusion is as dark

01:04:28.274 --> 01:04:29.541
as the sky is quickly becoming.

01:04:29.543 --> 01:04:30.575
But he's not finished.

01:04:30.577 --> 01:04:31.943
Yeah, what time is it anyways?

01:04:31.945 --> 01:04:34.178
I at least need to
get nine hour of sleep

01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:36.483
to keep my healthy shine.

01:04:37.718 --> 01:04:39.751
Bedtime,
that's the time.

01:04:39.753 --> 01:04:41.720
I'm with you big guy.

01:04:41.722 --> 01:04:42.687
Which way to my tent?

01:04:42.689 --> 01:04:43.988
If you haven't noticed,

01:04:43.990 --> 01:04:46.725
there's only one
tent for all of us.

01:04:46.727 --> 01:04:48.860
You expect us to
quarter together?

01:04:48.862 --> 01:04:50.762
Well, like the song goes,

01:04:50.764 --> 01:04:53.131
love grows best
in little houses.

01:04:53.133 --> 01:04:53.967
Or tents.

01:05:01.808 --> 01:05:03.808
Get off my leg!

01:05:03.810 --> 01:05:08.148
Happily would if
you'd stop choking my arm.

01:05:14.788 --> 01:05:16.688
The air's
asphyxiating in here.

01:05:16.690 --> 01:05:18.422
Would everybody just relax?

01:05:18.424 --> 01:05:19.926
It's not that bad.

01:05:20.994 --> 01:05:23.762
I'm sad about Mary's parents.

01:05:23.764 --> 01:05:27.398
Yeah, no amount of muscle
could fix their mess.

01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:29.067
Should we tell them?

01:05:29.069 --> 01:05:30.669
Tell us what?

01:05:30.671 --> 01:05:32.303
That there's
more to the story.

01:05:32.305 --> 01:05:33.905
You mean
that wasn't the end?

01:05:33.907 --> 01:05:35.940
No, I tried to tell you that.

01:05:35.942 --> 01:05:38.142
So let's
hear it already.

01:05:42.649 --> 01:05:45.016
Well after
Mary's mother drove off,

01:05:45.018 --> 01:05:46.217
Mary ran off.

01:05:46.219 --> 01:05:47.886
We chased her
for about a half an hour

01:05:47.888 --> 01:05:51.091
until we finally
caught up with her.

01:06:14.047 --> 01:06:17.784
Mary Beth, what
exactly are you doing?

01:06:20.754 --> 01:06:21.953
You lied to me!

01:06:21.955 --> 01:06:23.321
You lied to me Pastor Murphy.

01:06:23.323 --> 01:06:24.155
You lied!

01:06:24.157 --> 01:06:25.523
Mary Beth!

01:06:25.525 --> 01:06:26.490
Mary stop.

01:06:26.492 --> 01:06:27.425
You lied!

01:06:27.427 --> 01:06:28.426
I don't understand.

01:06:28.428 --> 01:06:29.794
What have I lied to you about?

01:06:29.796 --> 01:06:31.596
You said that if my
parents found the necklace

01:06:31.598 --> 01:06:33.331
that their marriage
would be okay.

01:06:33.333 --> 01:06:35.399
It's not, it didn't work.

01:06:35.401 --> 01:06:36.635
Pearl necklace?

01:06:36.637 --> 01:06:38.069
The pearl of great price.

01:06:38.071 --> 01:06:40.839
It was the stolen
necklace, right?

01:06:40.841 --> 01:06:42.841
Mary Beth, the necklace
could never change

01:06:42.843 --> 01:06:44.008
two people's hearts.

01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:45.977
At least not lasting change.

01:06:45.979 --> 01:06:48.112
No matter how much
money it costs.

01:06:48.114 --> 01:06:49.280
But you said.

01:06:49.282 --> 01:06:51.382
You said it would
heal their marriage.

01:06:51.384 --> 01:06:52.585
Yes I did.

01:06:55.756 --> 01:06:56.621
Let me tell ya a story.

01:06:56.623 --> 01:06:58.089
Ya'll have a seat.

01:06:58.091 --> 01:06:58.992
Come sit down.

01:07:06.266 --> 01:07:11.502
The kingdom of heaven is like
a treasure hidden in a field,

01:07:11.504 --> 01:07:13.437
which a man found and hid,

01:07:13.439 --> 01:07:16.975
and for joy over it, he went
and sold all that he had

01:07:16.977 --> 01:07:19.343
and he bought that field.

01:07:19.345 --> 01:07:22.647
And again, the kingdom
of heaven is like

01:07:22.649 --> 01:07:24.849
a merchant seeking
beautiful pearls,

01:07:24.851 --> 01:07:27.351
who when he had found
one pearl of great price,

01:07:27.353 --> 01:07:32.023
went and sold all that
he had, and he bought it.

01:07:32.025 --> 01:07:34.225
You mean we did all this work

01:07:34.227 --> 01:07:36.995
and the pearl is just
some old Bible story?

01:07:36.997 --> 01:07:39.563
Pastor Murphy, if the necklace
can't save their marriage,

01:07:39.565 --> 01:07:41.565
is there anything that can?

01:07:41.567 --> 01:07:42.834
Just one thing.

01:07:42.836 --> 01:07:44.869
The kingdom of
heaven, the pearl.

01:07:44.871 --> 01:07:46.604
That's right.

01:07:46.606 --> 01:07:48.139
But what is it?

01:07:48.141 --> 01:07:51.976
Well the kingdom of heaven
is not something you can see,

01:07:51.978 --> 01:07:53.978
but once you find it,
you'll gladly give up

01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:56.080
all you have to enter into it.

01:07:56.082 --> 01:08:00.018
And just for fun, say someone
wanted to enter into it,

01:08:00.020 --> 01:08:01.720
how would they do that?

01:08:01.722 --> 01:08:04.088
They would have to
repent and be born again.

01:08:04.090 --> 01:08:06.124
You were listening those
times you came to church,

01:08:06.126 --> 01:08:06.925
weren't you?

01:08:06.927 --> 01:08:08.492
Repent?

01:08:08.494 --> 01:08:10.328
Turn away from your sins.

01:08:10.330 --> 01:08:13.965
I'm sorry, but
repent, be born again.

01:08:13.967 --> 01:08:15.566
No offense, but
I just wanna know

01:08:15.568 --> 01:08:17.068
how to help Mary's parents.

01:08:17.069 --> 01:08:19.837
Besides, we're not
sinners, we're just kids.

01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:22.506
And we help people
fix their problems.

01:08:22.508 --> 01:08:26.279
I want ya'll to look
at something for me.

01:08:33.153 --> 01:08:33.984
It's a mirror.

01:08:33.987 --> 01:08:36.857
Oh it's much more than that.

01:08:39.625 --> 01:08:40.892
It's the 10 commandments.

01:08:40.894 --> 01:08:42.393
That's right.

01:08:42.395 --> 01:08:45.897
You see God gave us a way,
that if we're brave enough,

01:08:45.899 --> 01:08:47.966
we can look right
into our own hearts

01:08:47.968 --> 01:08:49.935
and see what's there.

01:08:53.305 --> 01:08:54.140
Not bad.

01:08:57.042 --> 01:08:58.777
But I haven't
broken any of these.

01:08:58.779 --> 01:09:00.111
I'm not a murderer.

01:09:00.113 --> 01:09:02.947
Cricket, Jesus says
even if we hate someone,

01:09:02.948 --> 01:09:04.582
it's the same as murder.

01:09:04.584 --> 01:09:06.019
He said that?

01:09:09.154 --> 01:09:11.455
Don't you dare try to blame me.

01:09:11.457 --> 01:09:12.991
You don't understand.

01:09:12.993 --> 01:09:14.524
You don't know everything.

01:09:14.527 --> 01:09:15.359
You're dumb.

01:09:15.361 --> 01:09:16.460
You're dumb.

01:09:16.462 --> 01:09:17.728
You're dumb.

01:09:17.729 --> 01:09:21.401
You're dumb.

01:09:23.103 --> 01:09:24.836
Good thing I love everyone.

01:09:24.837 --> 01:09:26.037
Especially yourself.

01:09:26.038 --> 01:09:28.439
Look at number two.

01:09:28.441 --> 01:09:33.077
You shall not make
for yourself any idols.

01:09:33.078 --> 01:09:34.045
What are you doing?

01:09:34.046 --> 01:09:35.279
I'm just fixing my hair.

01:09:35.281 --> 01:09:36.447
Get down.

01:09:36.448 --> 01:09:38.149
Can't improve on perfection.
Not bad, not bad.

01:09:38.151 --> 01:09:39.984
Can't improve on perfection.
Not bad, not bad.

01:09:39.986 --> 01:09:43.220
Can't improve on perfection.
Not bad.

01:09:43.223 --> 01:09:43.790
Oh.

01:09:44.957 --> 01:09:48.161
What about you
Mary, what do you see?

01:09:50.595 --> 01:09:52.063
What color's your money?

01:09:52.064 --> 01:09:54.999
The color of a princess's
eyes in a field of clover.

01:09:55.001 --> 01:09:56.567
I lied about having the money.

01:09:56.569 --> 01:09:58.069
Field of clover,
field of clover.

01:09:58.071 --> 01:09:59.637
I lied about having the money.

01:09:59.639 --> 01:10:01.405
Field of clover,
field of clover.

01:10:01.407 --> 01:10:02.943
Field of clover.

01:10:04.410 --> 01:10:06.044
You shall not lie.

01:10:06.046 --> 01:10:07.378
You see, it's
because of our sins

01:10:07.380 --> 01:10:09.647
that we fall short of
God's perfect standard.

01:10:09.649 --> 01:10:11.349
We're all broken in his eyes.

01:10:11.351 --> 01:10:14.152
And that's what we need
healing and forgiveness from,

01:10:14.154 --> 01:10:16.620
because the wages
of sin is death.

01:10:16.622 --> 01:10:19.824
But the gift of God is
eternal life in Jesus.

01:10:19.826 --> 01:10:21.459
Jesus came to
offer us that gift.

01:10:21.461 --> 01:10:23.127
And that's what I
was referring to Mary

01:10:23.129 --> 01:10:24.662
when I said that your
parents needed to find

01:10:24.664 --> 01:10:26.898
the pearl of great price.

01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:28.401
Do you understand?

01:10:35.275 --> 01:10:38.076
I want to, I wanna be
reconciled to God right now.

01:10:38.078 --> 01:10:40.011
Cricket, what are you doing?

01:10:40.013 --> 01:10:42.113
Remember how I said
that we don't need God

01:10:42.115 --> 01:10:44.715
because we can fix
things ourselves?

01:10:44.717 --> 01:10:45.749
Yeah?

01:10:45.751 --> 01:10:47.151
Well I was lying.

01:10:47.153 --> 01:10:48.419
I've been waiting my whole life

01:10:48.421 --> 01:10:50.688
for somebody to explain
all of this to me.

01:10:50.690 --> 01:10:52.123
You have?

01:10:52.125 --> 01:10:54.458
But if you become a Christian,
that'll change things.

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:56.961
I know what the pearl
of price is now, Ben.

01:10:56.963 --> 01:10:59.063
And I'll give up
everything to get it.

01:10:59.065 --> 01:11:01.165
Cricket, the Bible
says that only those

01:11:01.167 --> 01:11:04.035
righteous in God's sight
can enter into his kingdom.

01:11:04.037 --> 01:11:06.070
Well that rules us out then.

01:11:06.072 --> 01:11:09.173
But it also says that
he is faithful and just.

01:11:09.175 --> 01:11:10.708
And he'll forgive us our sins

01:11:10.710 --> 01:11:13.912
and cleanse us from all
thoughts of unrighteousness.

01:11:13.914 --> 01:11:15.381
Do you understand?

01:11:20.820 --> 01:11:21.621
Cricket.

01:11:22.822 --> 01:11:24.956
Cricket, Cricket.

01:11:24.958 --> 01:11:25.992
Cricket!

01:11:30.596 --> 01:11:31.397
Cricket.

01:11:33.533 --> 01:11:37.570
Pastor Murphy, I want
God's forgiveness too.

01:11:50.083 --> 01:11:51.582
How 'bout you Ben?

01:11:51.584 --> 01:11:53.319
Do you see your need?

01:11:55.188 --> 01:11:57.588
Uncle Jim once told
me that as we grew up

01:11:57.590 --> 01:12:00.091
there would come
along moments in life,

01:12:00.093 --> 01:12:03.127
moments that depending
on our actions

01:12:03.129 --> 01:12:06.397
would determine the whole
course of our lives.

01:12:06.399 --> 01:12:10.203
I knew that this is
one of those moments.

01:13:09.295 --> 01:13:13.464
Dear God, I know what
Pastor Murphy said is true.

01:13:13.466 --> 01:13:16.034
I'm sorry for all the
bad stuff I've done.

01:13:16.036 --> 01:13:18.502
I'm sorry for thinking
I didn't need you.

01:13:18.504 --> 01:13:21.539
I'm sorry you haven't been
number one in my life.

01:13:21.541 --> 01:13:22.375
Until now.

01:13:24.277 --> 01:13:27.680
Please fix in me what
I can't fix myself.

01:13:39.892 --> 01:13:41.125
I'm sorry I left.

01:13:41.127 --> 01:13:42.826
I just needed some
time to think.

01:13:42.828 --> 01:13:44.028
But I'm done now.

01:13:44.030 --> 01:13:45.529
And?

01:13:45.531 --> 01:13:48.132
And the pearl is more
beautiful than I ever imagined.

01:13:48.134 --> 01:13:51.202
Yay!

01:13:51.204 --> 01:13:53.304
You know this is gonna
change things, right?

01:13:53.306 --> 01:13:55.273
Are we still gonna
be the Fix It Boys?

01:13:55.275 --> 01:13:56.740
There's only one Fix It person

01:13:56.742 --> 01:14:00.446
and I'm sure he'll be
glad to let you help.

01:14:02.448 --> 01:14:04.548
I can't wait
to tell Mom and Dad.

01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:05.316
Me too.

01:14:05.318 --> 01:14:06.317
I'm sorry I killed Spock.

01:14:06.319 --> 01:14:07.651
That's okay.

01:14:07.653 --> 01:14:10.388
I can buy a new computer
with the reward money.

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:12.558
What reward money?

01:14:20.366 --> 01:14:22.933
Again, the kingdom
of heaven is like a merchant,

01:14:22.935 --> 01:14:24.468
seeking beautiful pearls.

01:14:24.470 --> 01:14:26.370
Since learning what
the pearl of great price was,

01:14:26.372 --> 01:14:28.072
we were able to give G-Dog

01:14:28.074 --> 01:14:32.044
the answers his heart
had been searching for.

01:14:33.679 --> 01:14:37.014
Though he's still in jail
paying for his past crimes,

01:14:37.016 --> 01:14:38.518
his heart is free.

01:14:41.354 --> 01:14:42.453
And although we
weren't able to find

01:14:42.455 --> 01:14:44.355
the necklace Uncle Jimmy bought,

01:14:44.357 --> 01:14:46.257
Mary Beth's necklace
was more than enough

01:14:46.259 --> 01:14:50.630
to put that cat burglar
right where she needed to be.

01:14:59.305 --> 01:15:02.540
Speaking of Uncle Jim,
once all the dust settled

01:15:02.542 --> 01:15:05.476
and we got a chance to explain
to him what the pearl was,

01:15:05.478 --> 01:15:07.878
well, he gave his
life to the Lord

01:15:07.880 --> 01:15:10.416
right there in the junkyard.

01:15:11.517 --> 01:15:12.883
He said it was the kind of love

01:15:12.885 --> 01:15:15.488
he'd always been looking for.

01:15:21.194 --> 01:15:23.727
Kingdom of heaven is
like a treasure in a field,

01:15:23.729 --> 01:15:27.865
which a man found and
hid, and for joy over it,

01:15:27.867 --> 01:15:31.202
he went and sold all that he
had and bought that field.

01:15:31.204 --> 01:15:33.937
And Mary Beth's parents,

01:15:33.939 --> 01:15:35.839
they never did sign
the divorce papers.

01:15:35.841 --> 01:15:38.409
Who when he had
found the pearl of great price,

01:15:38.411 --> 01:15:41.645
went and sold all that
he had and he bought it.

01:15:41.647 --> 01:15:44.182
Once again, the kingdom
of heaven is like a net

01:15:44.184 --> 01:15:46.819
that was let down into the lake.

01:15:48.254 --> 01:15:50.154
And with a little
help from some friends,

01:15:50.156 --> 01:15:51.589
Mary was able to convince them

01:15:51.591 --> 01:15:55.661
to give God and their
marriage one more try.

01:16:11.010 --> 01:16:13.377
My real name is Phillip.

01:16:13.379 --> 01:16:15.446
I thought Pierce
would make me sound

01:16:15.448 --> 01:16:17.481
more like a male model.

01:16:17.483 --> 01:16:19.317
Are you a model?

01:16:19.319 --> 01:16:21.719
Nope, I'm actually
afraid of mirrors.

01:16:21.721 --> 01:16:25.122
Well, there's more to life
than being just good looking.

01:16:25.124 --> 01:16:27.525
I'm living proof of that.

01:16:27.527 --> 01:16:29.860
Your humility overwhelms me.

01:16:29.862 --> 01:16:32.796
I actually wanna
be a botanist.

01:16:32.798 --> 01:16:35.533
I didn't think it would
make me cool enough though.

01:16:35.535 --> 01:16:37.535
I think you'd be cool.

01:16:37.537 --> 01:16:39.002
Yeah, me too squirt.

01:16:39.004 --> 01:16:40.704
I mean Phillip.

01:16:40.706 --> 01:16:42.174
Thanks Marty.

01:16:43.809 --> 01:16:46.510
Oh and Marty, I can
find an herb tomorrow

01:16:46.512 --> 01:16:48.946
to help with that poison ivy.

01:16:48.948 --> 01:16:50.481
Poison ivy?

01:16:50.483 --> 01:16:51.849
What about you Marty?

01:16:51.851 --> 01:16:54.117
Who do you think God
wants you to become?

01:16:54.119 --> 01:16:57.855
I think I need to work on
what he doesn't want me to be.

01:16:57.857 --> 01:17:02.926
But, I'd also like to
run an animal shelter.

01:17:02.928 --> 01:17:04.262
Really?

01:17:04.264 --> 01:17:06.364
Yeah, I'd like to take
care of hurt animals,

01:17:06.366 --> 01:17:07.800
especially puppies.

01:17:09.402 --> 01:17:12.303
I'd like to see what I can
learn outside of my laboratory.

01:17:12.305 --> 01:17:14.772
Starting with this
pearl of great price.

01:17:14.774 --> 01:17:15.608
Me too.

01:17:18.844 --> 01:17:19.412
Me too.

01:17:20.646 --> 01:17:23.247
God's kingdom was
made for guys like us.

01:17:23.249 --> 01:17:24.284
Yeah?

01:17:26.286 --> 01:17:27.985
- Ben?
- Yeah.

01:17:27.987 --> 01:17:29.219
Thanks for this.

01:17:29.221 --> 01:17:30.588
I thought you hated camping.

01:17:30.590 --> 01:17:33.156
Not the camping, I
still hate camping.

01:17:33.158 --> 01:17:34.760
For reminding me.

01:17:40.333 --> 01:17:42.266
Wait,
that was poison ivy?

01:17:42.268 --> 01:17:43.567
You are so dead!

01:17:43.569 --> 01:17:46.169
This
is a $20 hairstyle.

01:17:46.171 --> 01:17:48.038
Please don't mess it up.

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:50.308
Somebody get Marty off of me!

01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:51.409
Not again.

01:17:51.411 --> 01:17:52.678
Knock it off!

01:17:58.017 --> 01:17:59.852
Scene one M-A take one.

01:18:03.589 --> 01:18:06.424
Okay, and we're rolling.

01:18:06.426 --> 01:18:07.993
And, Jim's playing.

01:18:10.630 --> 01:18:18.502
