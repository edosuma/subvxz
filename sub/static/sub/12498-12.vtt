previously on "october road"

00:01.700 --> 00:02.500
you and janet--

00:02.500 --> 00:04.900
dating her is like
eating pizza with a knife and fork.

00:04.900 --> 00:07.600
It's not something you do
unless you really have to.

00:10.000 --> 00:11.600
rooster!
I gotta go.

00:12.700 --> 00:14.400
We agreed the boys
could stay all day.

00:14.400 --> 00:15.400
Let me handle this.

00:15.400 --> 00:17.400
Your son--
he's a lovely child,

00:17.400 --> 00:19.000
especially for a bastard.

00:21.200 --> 00:22.700
Nick, you're broke.

00:22.700 --> 00:23.600
what do you mean,
I'm broke?

00:23.600 --> 00:24.800
If there's something wrong with you,

00:24.800 --> 00:26.000
you need to know what it is.

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
It's never good news
when they wanna run more tests.

Um,Morning.

hold on a sec.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.500
Have a good day.

01:18.500 --> 01:20.600
Oh. You, too.

01:20.600 --> 01:22.100
There's a surprise inside.

01:22.100 --> 01:23.300
Yeah?

01:23.500 --> 01:24.500
Peanut butter cookies?

01:24.500 --> 01:27.400
You'll just have to wait and see.
*I won't let you tear my world apart*

01:27.400 --> 01:31.700
.
*I won't let you tear my world apart*

01:32.800 --> 01:35.900
*I'm coming back from...*

01:36.200 --> 01:39.100
I can't remember the town
commons looking more beautul,

01:39.700 --> 01:41.400
more full of life.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.600
I didn't hit a single
red light on the way here.

01:44.600 --> 01:46.200
Not one. Whoo!

01:46.900 --> 01:47.800
If I cld,

01:47.800 --> 01:49.600
I'd take today and put it up on my mantle

01:49.600 --> 01:52.600
right next to the red sox
winning the world series. Hello.

01:52.600 --> 01:54.400
Then I'm guessing you haven't heard.

01:54.600 --> 01:55.900
Heard what?

01:56.500 --> 01:59.100
You might want to reconsider
your memory mantle choice

01:59.100 --> 02:01.000
after you hear
what I'm about to say.

02:01.500 --> 02:04.000
Rory dunlop is back in town.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.000
eddie'S...

02:07.000 --> 02:08.500
ex-girlfriend rory dunlop?

02:08.500 --> 02:11.100
Also known as head
cheerleader rory dunlop,

02:11.100 --> 02:13.000
prom queen rory dunlop,

02:13.000 --> 02:14.500
and let's not forget,

02:14.500 --> 02:19.200
the-only-girl-ever-to-dump
eddie-latekka rory dunlop.

02:20.900 --> 02:24.800
*shine like a morning star*

02:25.000 --> 02:26.600
oh, I can't believe it.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.400
It's like the biggest
boomerang on the planet.

02:28.400 --> 02:31.000
why can't we get rid of
these defective windows?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.600
Maybe the universe is
trying to telus something.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.200
Yeah, you can't fill out a shipping label.

02:34.200 --> 02:36.500
Hey. Don't look at me.
You're the one that ordered it in the first place.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.200
We needed it.
????????

02:38.200 --> 02:39.800
where's the original invoice?

02:39.800 --> 02:41.500
In the back.
Be my guest.

02:43.700 --> 02:44.300
hello?

02:44.300 --> 02:47.800
Doctor, is there
no limit to my generosity?

02:47.800 --> 02:49.200
What's up, stratton?

02:49.200 --> 02:50.700
How's life in the big city?

02:50.700 --> 02:53.700
The unbreakable N.Y.C.
Is too small to contain me.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.300
I feel like I'm
busting at the seams.

02:55.300 --> 02:59.100
That's how serious my cup
runneth over with generosity.

02:59.100 --> 03:01.000
Okay, okay.
I'll break.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
What's got you
in such a giving mood?

03:03.000 --> 03:04.700
Can you say, "u2"?

03:04.700 --> 03:06.100
"You, too"
as in "me also,"

03:06.100 --> 03:08.100
or are you talking about
the rock band from dublin?

03:08.100 --> 03:10.000
If by "rock band from dublin"

03:10.000 --> 03:12.100
you mean the rock band from dublin,

03:12.100 --> 03:14.100
"where the streets have no names"
and all that,

03:14.100 --> 03:16.800
then yes. U2 wants you,

03:16.800 --> 03:20.300
nicholson garrett,to join them
on their next world tour.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.100
Are you kidding me?

03:21.100 --> 03:22.800
Five months,
six continents,

03:22.800 --> 03:24.800
and one tour book
that is to feature

03:24.800 --> 03:29.500
your meditations alongside
the photographs by sofia coppola.

03:29.500 --> 03:30.600
Do you feel me?

03:30.600 --> 03:32.200
Do you feel that tingle right there?

03:32.200 --> 03:34.300
Well, that's my generosity.

03:34.700 --> 03:37.400
Oh, man. I-I love u2.Like,

03:37.400 --> 03:40.000
"the joshua tree" tour--
that was the first concert I ever went to.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.200
I was, like--
I was, like, 9.

03:42.200 --> 03:43.600
Yes, you were.

03:43.600 --> 03:46.100
yeah,but I-I can't just disappear,

03:46.100 --> 03:47.900
you know,
for five months.

03:48.200 --> 03:49.600
I got a business,

03:50.100 --> 03:51.900
responsibilities,
you know?

03:52.100 --> 03:53.700
I have responsibilities,too,

03:53.700 --> 03:57.500
and one of them is to
let my client know when he'talking crazy.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.400
Hello?

04:00.400 --> 04:01.900
You there?

04:02.100 --> 04:03.300
Doctor?

04:03.300 --> 04:05.200
Yeah. Look, I gotta go.
I'll call you later.

04:05.200 --> 04:11.800
*I'm coming up from being down so low *

04:11.800 --> 04:16.500
*I cannot stop this feeling*

04:16.500 --> 04:18.700
*stop this rolling stone *

04:20.300 --> 04:21.399
I don't know
what you're talking about.

04:21.399 --> 04:23.000
You guys look amazing,

04:23.000 --> 04:25.100
like ingrid bergman and cary grant.

04:25.100 --> 04:27.500
Ugh, I hate seeing pictures of myself,

04:28.000 --> 04:30.600
especially posed ones like this.

04:30.600 --> 04:32.900
Well, ray insisted on the photo
and the announcement.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.100
I could do without all the hullabaloo.

04:35.500 --> 04:38.200
Well, you better get used
to being the center of attention.

04:38.200 --> 04:39.800
You're gonna be a bride,
after all.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.400
All right, let's focus on
the engagement party first.

04:43.500 --> 04:46.400
At least I got ray not to rent out
the banquet hall at the johnson inn.

04:46.400 --> 04:48.400
Too much hullabaloo?
Exactly.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.200
Janet said you had some cool ideas.

04:51.000 --> 04:51.700
I do.

04:51.700 --> 04:54.600
Look, you have this beautiful house
and this amazing yard.

04:54.600 --> 04:56.100
There'definitely a way
that we could decorate it

04:56.100 --> 04:58.900
that is both elegant
yet understated.

05:00.500 --> 05:01.900
hold that thought.

05:06.800 --> 05:08.200
hannah danls?

05:08.200 --> 05:09.600
Uh, yes?

05:09.900 --> 05:11.000
I'm officer grso.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.400
We received a complaint alleging

05:12.400 --> 05:14.400
that you were involved in an assault.

05:15.100 --> 05:16.600
What?
Sorry,but I'm gonna have

05:16.600 --> 05:17.900
ask you to come with us.
Wait a second.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.900
Who did I allegedly assault?

05:20.700 --> 05:22.900
"Dr. Christine cataldo."

05:22.900 --> 05:24.100
Ma?

05:25.200 --> 05:27.000
Are you getting arrested?

05:27.000 --> 05:29.100
Of course not, sam.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.400
Am I being arrested?

05:32.800 --> 05:34.200
You are.

How you holding up, sam?

05:56.900 --> 05:58.100
Honestly,

05:58.100 --> 05:59.700
I'd rather be at school.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.600
Bet you never
pictured yourself saying that.

06:02.600 --> 06:04.400
I wish you were
at school,too, honey,but...

06:04.400 --> 06:06.700
I'm really glad
you guys are here with me.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.900
I'm gonna call ray,
and we're gonna get this figured out.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.000
hey, this is ray.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.500
Leave your number after the tone.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.400
ray, it's me.

06:26.400 --> 06:29.200
Can you stop by
or call the police station

06:29.200 --> 06:31.400
as soon as humanly possible?

06:32.000 --> 06:34.000
Your crazy ex-wife has filed

06:34.000 --> 06:35.500
assault charges against me,

06:35.500 --> 06:37.400
and they set the bail at $1,000.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.700
Sam's with me, too.

06:39.100 --> 06:41.000
I love you. Bye.

07:07.100 --> 07:09.200
you have bone marrow cancer.

07:22.600 --> 07:25.900
Therisn't a cure for
multiple myeloma, mr. Garrett.

07:26.100 --> 07:28.100
The good news is that patients

07:28.100 --> 07:30.700
li years with this disease.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.700
We caught the cancer early,

07:31.700 --> 07:33.000
and so with aggressive treatment,

07:33.000 --> 07:35.900
I'd say that your prognosis is very good.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.800
Will I lose my hair?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.200
I mean, I made it this long
with a full head.

07:43.100 --> 07:45.000
I was kind of hoping
to keep it that way.

07:45.200 --> 07:46.700
Generally speaking,

07:46.700 --> 07:48.700
chemotherapy for bone marw cancer

07:48.700 --> 07:51.900
causes less hair loss
thanome other cancers.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.500
How old are you?
30?

07:58.600 --> 08:00.500
I think there ought to be a law

08:00.500 --> 08:04.200
that doctor save to be
at least 70 years old

08:04.200 --> 08:06.700
before they're allowed
to practice medicine.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.700
You make me feel like
I didn't do enough in life.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.800
How old are you?

08:24.200 --> 08:25.900
I'm 32.

08:25.900 --> 08:28.300
Oh. You're 32.

08:29.200 --> 08:31.600
I have bone marrow cancer.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.700
I don't suppose I could sell you
on the idea of, um,

08:37.700 --> 08:40.000
switching places with me?

08:42.600 --> 08:45.000
do you have any family
who could help you through this?

08:45.900 --> 08:47.500
My two boys live with me.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.100
That's perfect.

08:49.700 --> 08:53.700
We'll do our best to minimize
any disruptions to your daily life,

08:53.900 --> 08:55.800
but it's good to have a constant

08:55.800 --> 08:57.900
that you can rely on,
like your sons.

09:01.000 --> 09:01.900
Guess what else?

09:01.900 --> 09:03.400
I heard rory's husband

09:03.400 --> 09:05.700
dumped her for his secretary.

09:05.700 --> 09:08.000
So what?
Who gives a poop about that?

09:08.000 --> 09:09.600
You didn't let me finish.

09:09.800 --> 09:12.800
His secretary is a dude.

09:13.100 --> 09:14.600
You mean like a man dude?

09:14.600 --> 09:16.500
Yep. Imagine that.

09:16.500 --> 09:18.800
I swear, you boys are
the biggest gossips in town.

09:18.800 --> 09:20.500
I thought you'd be interested in this.

09:20.500 --> 09:22.000
Rory did break eddie's heart.

09:22.000 --> 09:24.700
Not so much break
as put on her stilto heels

09:24.700 --> 09:26.500
and impale it repeatedly.

09:26.500 --> 09:29.200
Rememberow eddie used to
drive 40 miles to goombah's

09:29.200 --> 09:30.900
to pick up strombolis for rory?

09:30.900 --> 09:33.800
Their business was never better than
when those two were in love.

09:33.800 --> 09:35.100
Then rory dumped him.

09:35.100 --> 09:37.100
She would not partake in the stromboli,

09:37.100 --> 09:39.400
and eddie swore off goombah's altogether.

09:39.800 --> 09:41.900
I don't think
he's had a stromboli since.

09:42.100 --> 09:43.500
What's your point?

09:44.900 --> 09:47.200
Just that with rory back in the ridge,

09:47.200 --> 09:49.900
eddie might have a sudden aetite
for the stromboli again.

09:49.900 --> 09:51.800
*it's not like that,*

09:52.000 --> 09:54.200
*oh, yeah *

09:55.100 --> 09:57.500
*oh, it's not like that,*

09:57.500 --> 10:00.200
*my love *

10:00.500 --> 10:02.800
*Oh, it's not like that*

10:05.600 --> 10:07.400
look, I put a little extra in there.

10:07.400 --> 10:09.500
Just, uh, consider it a bonus
for all the hard work.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.000
Thanks, big cat. Wow.

10:12.500 --> 10:13.900
I could really use it.

10:13.900 --> 10:15.600
Keep up the good work,david.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.000
See?

10:18.000 --> 10:20.000
Working for big cat
isn't so bad.

10:20.700 --> 10:21.600
It's a job.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.600
Well, it beats worng for
that two-fed hothead latekka.

10:25.700 --> 10:26.700
I mean,

10:26.700 --> 10:29.000
at least with the big cat,
you know where you stand,you know?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.300
Latekka?

10:31.600 --> 10:33.500
that guy--man,
he'll smile right to your face,

10:33.500 --> 10:35.300
kick you in the 'nads
when you're not lookin'.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.500
You're so full of it,lauche.

10:38.500 --> 10:40.800
Coward sucker punched me
in his office.

10:41.300 --> 10:43.400
I tell you what.
If ray wasn't there to stop me,

10:43.400 --> 10:45.000
I would have put him through
that store front window of his

10:45.000 --> 10:46.700
and made him eat glass.

10:47.100 --> 10:49.300
well, good thing ray was there.

10:52.800 --> 10:54.300
you know what, man?
You're new to this crew,

10:54.300 --> 10:56.400
okay? And ray likes you,
so...

10:57.600 --> 10:59.500
I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt.

11:13.800 --> 11:16.200
why am I always
on this side of the dolly?

11:17.300 --> 11:19.100
Feel free to chiin sometime, pal.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Eddie, hold it up.

11:21.800 --> 11:22.800
We're almost there, man.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.200
What, you need a break from
watching me do all the work?

11:27.000 --> 11:28.800
No, I think you need a break.

11:29.700 --> 11:31.100
What are you talking about?

11:35.500 --> 11:36.900
Hi, eddie.

11:45.700 --> 11:48.000
wow. Hey. Rory dunlop,
what's going on?

11:48.000 --> 11:50.000
It's been a while.
Yeah.

11:50.000 --> 11:51.000
You guys really did it.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.300
The highchool dream--

11:52.300 --> 11:54.100
best friend windows.

11:56.300 --> 11:57.400
I've read your book.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.000
Really?

11:58.000 --> 12:00.800
Yeah, I, uh, particularly
identifiedith "tory."

12:00.800 --> 12:04.100
Yeah, about that--
yeah, it's fine, really.

12:04.100 --> 12:06.300
It was nice that tory and freddy
ended up together.

12:06.300 --> 12:08.500
At least there was
one happy ending in the book.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.200
yeah.
oh.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
I should go.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
What?
Yeah.

12:18.400 --> 12:19.600
Wait. What...

12:19.600 --> 12:21.300
what about the box?

12:21.300 --> 12:24.700
I don't think the box is
going anywhere anytime soon.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.700
It's good to see you again,rory.

12:26.700 --> 12:28.000
See you, nick.
Yeah.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.800
so, um...
where's jake?

12:33.800 --> 12:35.200
He's back in connecticut,

12:35.200 --> 12:37.400
moving into
his boyfriend's apartment.

12:39.100 --> 12:40.200
Boyfriend?

12:40.200 --> 12:41.900
Yep.Apparently,

12:41.900 --> 12:44.700
s assistant is
the love of his life--edgar.

12:44.700 --> 12:46.100
Go figure.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.000
Wow. I, uh,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.200
I don't know what to say.

12:49.200 --> 12:51.400
Yeah, I-I should have seen the signs,

12:51.400 --> 12:54.400
especially the one where ey
celebrated national secretary day

12:54.400 --> 12:55.700
in the bahamas.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.200
oh. Um, givee a second

13:02.600 --> 13:03.500
hey.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.100
just wanted to say hi.

13:05.100 --> 13:06.700
What goes on with you?

13:06.900 --> 13:10.000
Um, you know, I'm--I'm kinda
in the mdle of somethin'.

13:10.000 --> 13:11.900
You mind if I call you back?

13:11.900 --> 13:13.700
No, that's fine.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.400
Okay, I'll, um,

13:15.400 --> 13:16.500
I'll talk to you later.

13:16.500 --> 13:17.500
Bye.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.400
why don't we go for a walk?

13:26.400 --> 13:27.900
What about my mom?

13:28.300 --> 13:30.700
I think I have an idea
on how we can help her.

13:31.600 --> 13:34.000
Hey, this is ray.
Leave your number after the tone.

13:38.900 --> 13:40.400
you should talk to a lawyer.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.600
Look, I know you probably
hear this all the time,

13:42.600 --> 13:44.000
but this is nothing.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.200
It's just a big misunderstanding.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.800
An assault charge isn't nothing.

13:47.800 --> 13:49.700
You could spend up to a year in jail.

13:52.700 --> 13:53.800
I'm fine.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.000
What does that even mean?

13:58.200 --> 14:01.400
well, the doctor said
I have to do chemo,

14:01.400 --> 14:04.400
but I probably won't lose much hair,
if any at all,

14:05.000 --> 14:06.900
which is a-a good thing,

14:06.900 --> 14:09.500
considerin' I just bought
a new hair dryer.

14:11.600 --> 14:15.400
I don't think you've grasped
the severity of your diagnosis.

14:15.800 --> 14:17.800
You have cancer, robert,

14:17.800 --> 14:20.000
and it's fantastic
that they caught it early

14:20.000 --> 14:21.900
and that your doctor thinks
it's highly treatable.

14:21.900 --> 14:23.600
Those are--those are blessings,

14:23.600 --> 14:25.100
but you have a disease.

14:25.100 --> 14:26.000
It's--

14:26.000 --> 14:28.400
it's not like you have the flu.
I know you went through this

14:28.400 --> 14:29.600
before with your first husband.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.100
He had cancer. I have cancer,

14:31.100 --> 14:33.300
but my situation is--

14:33.300 --> 14:35.400
is a different beast altogether.

14:36.900 --> 14:38.500
The doc...

14:38.500 --> 14:42.400
said I... could live
with this a long time.

14:45.900 --> 14:47.600
did you tell the boys?

14:47.600 --> 14:49.100
Mnh-mnh.

14:50.700 --> 14:52.900
And I'd appreciate it
if you didn't either.

14:52.900 --> 14:54.400
Of course.

14:56.100 --> 14:58.200
They should hear it from you.

14:59.400 --> 15:01.200
And they will...

15:03.000 --> 15:04.400
when I have something to tell them,

15:04.400 --> 15:06.800
but right now I'm fine.

15:10.700 --> 15:12.300
I'm fine.

15:16.100 --> 15:17.500
is goombah's still open?

15:17.500 --> 15:18.500
I-I think so,

15:18.500 --> 15:20.400
though I haven't been there in whilE.

15:20.400 --> 15:21.600
Well, that's a shocker.

15:21.600 --> 15:23.800
We used to live off of their strombolis.

15:24.900 --> 15:27.400
guess my palate changed over the years.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.800
Plus physical phil started
dating the pizza delivery girl,

15:29.800 --> 15:33.400
so I guess I got used
to the flat triangular stuff.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.900
So wt about you?

15:36.200 --> 15:37.900
Are you seeing anyone?

15:40.600 --> 15:43.400
I feel kinda weird talking
about my love life with you.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.600
I just got back to theidge,

15:44.600 --> 15:47.700
and even i know about
the legendary eddie latekka

15:47.700 --> 15:50.700
and the parade of beauties
that came after me.

15:50.700 --> 15:52.400
Yeah, I wouldn't exactly call it a parade.

15:52.400 --> 15:54.700
More like A... a circus.

15:54.700 --> 15:56.500
Yeah. Lots of juggling,

15:56.500 --> 15:59.300
tightrope walking, acrobatics?

15:59.300 --> 16:04.500
Uh... more like a lot of little clowns
crammed into a teeny, tiny car.

16:08.400 --> 16:09.800
I should go.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.500
Tell nick that I said good-bye.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.000
What's in here anyway?

16:16.300 --> 16:17.900
Oh, it's just a bunch of broken windows

16:17.900 --> 16:20.000
that got returned to us by mistake.

16:21.700 --> 16:22.600
Well, in my experience,

16:22.600 --> 16:23.700
if something gets sent back to you,

16:23.700 --> 16:25.900
there's usually a reason why.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.500
hey.
Has the edge called you?

16:42.500 --> 16:43.500
Who?
The edge,

16:43.500 --> 16:45.600
number 24 on "rolling stone's"

16:45.600 --> 16:48.800
"100 greatest guitarists of all time" list.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.700
Rumor is he's
a monster "turtle" fan. Huge!

16:54.200 --> 16:55.100
Hey.

16:55.400 --> 16:58.300
Hannah's in jail.
She needs your help to post bond.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.000
I, uh, I need to call you ba.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.400
Don't bother.

17:02.400 --> 17:04.599
You used that line
on me three hours ago.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.200
Like the fortune cookie says,

17:06.200 --> 17:07.800
"fool me once, shame on you.

17:07.800 --> 17:09.500
"Fool me twice,shame on you again

17:09.500 --> 17:11.599
for thinking you could fool me twic"

17:13.300 --> 17:14.900
what up, doctor?

17:15.800 --> 17:17.400
What are you ing here?

17:17.599 --> 17:19.700
I'm a full-service agent.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.300
Stratton lorb, and you are?

17:22.300 --> 17:24.200
Sttton, no.
This is a bad time, okay?

17:24.200 --> 17:26.200
My--my friend just got arrested.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.000
Well, how--how much is the bond?

17:28.000 --> 17:29.800
It's $1,000.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.200
I gotta go to the bank.

17:33.600 --> 17:34.900
Okay.

17:39.500 --> 17:40.000
Thank you.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.100
Mm-hmm. Like I said,

17:41.100 --> 17:43.600
I'm full service.
Do you need a ride to the police station?

17:43.600 --> 17:45.000
In your limo?

17:45.000 --> 17:47.000
That's the plan,
little man.

17:47.000 --> 17:48.100
Cool.

17:50.300 --> 17:51.300
let's go.

17:51.300 --> 17:52.800
Come on, baby.

18:09.200 --> 18:12.000
so? How did rory look?

18:12.000 --> 18:13.200
Is she still hot?

18:13.200 --> 18:14.300
Yeah, she looked fine.

18:14.300 --> 18:16.100
The word on the street is
she's a wreck

18:16.100 --> 18:18.300
ever since her husbandcame out of the closet

18:18.300 --> 18:19.500
and torpedoed their marriage.

18:19.500 --> 18:21.200
Yeah, I actually feel kinda bad for her.

18:21.200 --> 18:23.600
Why? She stomped on your heart

18:23.600 --> 18:26.400
and left you for dead
when she dumped you fojake.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.300
we were high school sweethearts.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.200
She went off to college.
She met jake.

18:31.200 --> 18:33.200
It wasn't the crime
of the century, owen.

18:33.200 --> 18:35.000
Well, she got hers.

18:35.600 --> 18:38.500
She hitched her wagon to a gay horse.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.600
eddie, you still have feelings for rory?

18:47.700 --> 18:49.900
what we had was so long ago.

18:49.900 --> 18:52.700
I-I know I'm not
that same guy anymore,

18:53.200 --> 18:57.200
but... seeing her,
for a second there,

18:57.300 --> 18:58.800
felt like I was
back in high school again.

18:58.800 --> 19:02.100
Nothing good can come
of tking like this.

19:02.100 --> 19:04.600
Let's not forg--
rory left you.

19:04.600 --> 19:06.400
You don't need to remind me.

19:06.800 --> 19:08.400
That's not something
you easily forget.

19:08.400 --> 19:11.000
You--you of all people
should know that, owen.

19:11.400 --> 19:13.300
And just because you're
so hell-bent on making alison

19:13.300 --> 19:14.800
and ikey suffer for what they did,

19:14.800 --> 19:17.500
doesn't mean that I can't
find a way to foive rory.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.800
clearly, she's still hot.

19:26.400 --> 19:27.700
Clearly.

19:28.800 --> 19:29.700
Yes.

19:31.500 --> 19:32.400
yeah.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.700
Nick,
what are you doing here?

19:34.700 --> 19:36.700
Um,I went to go get him.

19:36.700 --> 19:37.900
When we couldn't find ray,

19:37.900 --> 19:40.500
I thought nick could help.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.000
Thank you.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.100
No problem.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.500
I'm glad you're out of the pokey,

19:44.500 --> 19:46.700
but, um,
I gotta get to work.

19:47.400 --> 19:48.600
It was nice meeting you.

19:48.600 --> 19:49.300
Don't forget to stop

19:49.300 --> 19:52.000
by knights ridge's finest pizza parlor
before you leave.

19:52.000 --> 19:52.900
I won't, and, hey,

19:52.900 --> 19:55.300
I'm all about the slice.
Hey, what happened?

19:55.300 --> 19:56.900
Christine cataldo happened.

19:56.900 --> 19:58.800
She filed assault charges against me

19:58.800 --> 20:01.000
for the little altercation
at the yard sale.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.900
Assault?
Sorry. We still need you to sign some papers.

20:05.100 --> 20:06.100
no, it's okay.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.700
I'll take care of sam.

20:08.700 --> 20:10.000
Thanks.

20:15.300 --> 20:16.200
What?

20:16.200 --> 20:18.600
Now I get why you're
still in knights ridge.

20:18.600 --> 20:20.200
It's not like that.

20:20.200 --> 20:21.600
Hannah's engaged.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.600
To ray.

20:22.600 --> 20:23.800
Ray's ur dad, little man?

20:23.800 --> 20:25.800
No, gavin's my dad.

20:27.100 --> 20:28.500
bartender,get me a scorecard.

20:28.500 --> 20:29.800
So where's this, uh,

20:29.800 --> 20:30.700
ray character?

20:30.700 --> 20:32.000
I don't know.

20:32.400 --> 20:36.400
Feature yo-bailing out
another guy's fianc镋.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.000
Mm. Like I said,

20:38.000 --> 20:39.700
I know why
you're still in knights ridge.

20:39.700 --> 20:41.500
It's complicated.

20:43.100 --> 20:44.500
"into your arms"

20:47.200 --> 20:49.800
*I know a place *

20:49.800 --> 20:51.900
*where I can go *

20:59.200 --> 21:01.800
janet, come here, please.

21:08.200 --> 21:11.500
well, I guess the myth of
eddie latekka is alive and well.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.600
He is beloved.

21:13.600 --> 21:15.300
That's what I hear.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.500
Janet meadows, right?

21:17.500 --> 21:18.400
Good memory.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.000
Rory dunlop.

21:20.000 --> 21:21.000
I know.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.800
Uh, this is rooster.

21:22.800 --> 21:24.500
Hi, rooster.
Nice to meet you.

21:24.900 --> 21:27.400
Actually, we were in 11th grade
social studies together.

21:27.400 --> 21:28.700
Mrs. Longacre. Sixth period.

21:28.700 --> 21:31.500
You did a-a paper on amerigo vespucci,

21:31.500 --> 21:33.100
pretender to christopher columbus' crown.

21:33.100 --> 21:34.000
It was very good.

21:34.000 --> 21:35.500
Mine was on ponce de le髇,

21:35.500 --> 21:36.800
fountain of youth and all that.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.900
My real name is vincent.
Vincent russo.

21:38.900 --> 21:42.000
That's why they call me
"rooster." Rooster--russo.

21:42.000 --> 21:43.800
Russo--rooster.
Nicknames are fun.

21:44.500 --> 21:45.600
Okay, well,

21:45.600 --> 21:46.800
nice to see you, vincent.

21:46.800 --> 21:47.900
You, too.

21:47.900 --> 21:50.300
I gotta go fry onions.
Bye-bye.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.500
sorry about that.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.100
He hasn't been the same
since they invented blondes.

21:58.900 --> 22:02.200
So how--how is
eddie latekka anyways?

22:02.200 --> 22:03.400
How?

22:03.400 --> 22:04.900
Yeah, I sam himthis morning and...

22:04.900 --> 22:06.100
you saw eddie?

22:06.100 --> 22:07.500
Yeah, at best friend windows,

22:07.500 --> 22:10.100
that place that he opened up
with nick garrett.

22:10.100 --> 22:11.600
Right.

22:11.600 --> 22:12.800
How was that?

22:12.800 --> 22:15.200
It was awkward at first,
but then there were moments

22:15.200 --> 22:17.700
where it was like
I never even left.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.300
But he seemed...

22:21.300 --> 22:23.400
I don't know.
He seemed sad.

22:24.700 --> 22:27.100
Sad?
He seemed sad?

22:27.100 --> 22:30.300
Yeah, a little bit.
Is--is he okay the days?

22:31.200 --> 22:32.500
I think so.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.000
well,
it was nice to see you.

22:37.000 --> 22:38.600
You look beautiful,
by the way.

22:38.600 --> 22:40.500
Oh, thank you.

22:41.600 --> 22:44.300
Hey, rory. How long
are you in town for?

22:44.300 --> 22:48.300
Oh, I don't know.

22:44.829 --> 22:46.345
Everything's up in the air.

22:47.115 --> 22:49.898
Everything's different now,you know?

22:51.156 --> 22:57.161
So if I  should fall

22:58.806 --> 23:03.859
I  know I won't be

23:04.532 --> 23:07.891
Hey, hannah.This is stratton.

23:08.016 --> 23:10.064
Stratton, hannah.

23:10.231 --> 23:11.204
Nice to meet you.

23:11.316 --> 23:11.936
Hey.

23:12.539 --> 23:15.707
Sorry. I don't usually hang outin the police station,getting arrested.

23:15.796 --> 23:18.193
Some of my favorite people have a cell reserved for them

23:18.286 --> 23:20.666
every weekend at the ninth precinct.

23:22.350 --> 23:24.539
I'm sorry. I got hereas soon as I could.

23:27.970 --> 23:29.397
What's he doing here?

23:29.557 --> 23:31.515
Nick bailed meut.

23:32.011 --> 23:33.345
He bailed you out.

23:34.411 --> 23:35.713
N't tell me.

23:35.842 --> 23:39.286
The elusive butterfly known as ray.
Who are you?

23:39.419 --> 23:41.823
Stratton lorb,
swift like a locust.

23:43.673 --> 23:45.277
you know, I don't get it.
Hmm?

23:45.375 --> 23:47.091
Why can't you just disappear,man?

23:47.181 --> 23:50.004
Well, I would, but who wld bail your fianc閑 out of jail?

23:50.090 --> 23:52.812
Ray, one of us got arrested.
Let's not make it two.

23:53.962 --> 23:54.913
Here.

23:56.730 --> 23:57.765
Thanks.

23:58.031 --> 23:59.131
See ya.

24:01.008 --> 24:02.785
Well, damn, doctor.

24:02.896 --> 24:05.708
Driving in here,I'm thinking norman rockwell,

24:05.819 --> 24:08.585
but after one hour,it's more like george orwell,

24:08.690 --> 24:11.855
latrell sprewell and baby fall down the well.

24:12.014 --> 24:14.073
Uh, thank you.

24:15.211 --> 24:17.704
I like knights ridge.
Mm-hmm.

24:33.049 --> 24:35.034
And now it comes with must have been a busy day.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.298
You never called me back.

24:36.404 --> 24:37.565
Oh, I'm sorry, janet.

24:37.677 --> 24:40.340
We had a-a unexpected visitor at the office.

24:40.470 --> 24:42.397
Oh, really? Who?

24:43.127 --> 24:46.180
Nick's agent, plus we have these defective windows.

24:46.329 --> 24:48.930
Noatter how many times we try and send them back,

24:49.041 --> 24:51.025
they--they just keep reappearing.

24:51.146 --> 24:52.683
It's--it's really annoying.

24:56.183 --> 24:59.130
So meredith got me a room at the johnson inn. You know it?

24:59.747 --> 25:01.102
Yeah, I do.

25:01.674 --> 25:02.879
So you're staying the night, huh?

25:02.987 --> 25:05.028
I am... till I geta "yes" out of you,

25:05.121 --> 25:07.742
as in"yes, bono. Yes, edge.

25:07.850 --> 25:09.480
"Yes, the other two guys in the band

25:09.583 --> 25:12.012
whose names I don't know."

25:12.918 --> 25:16.266
so tell me, if hannah's getting marrie..
yeah.

25:16.267 --> 25:17.554
What's keeping you here?

25:18.740 --> 25:20.153
Look around you, man.

25:20.361 --> 25:21.538
I'm looking.

25:22.174 --> 25:23.505
What am I looking at?

25:24.105 --> 25:25.720
You just don't get it,do you?

25:27.153 --> 25:28.128
Who does that?

25:28.250 --> 25:30.286
You said you wanted to walk.

25:30.384 --> 25:32.116
Hey, nicky!

25:32.223 --> 25:33.541
What goes on, franky-t?

25:33.660 --> 25:36.577
Hey, you're due for a trim.
I can see your sideburns from here.

25:36.721 --> 25:37.811
Yeah, yeah.

25:37.917 --> 25:39.540
Next week, I swear.

25:39.666 --> 25:42.083
All right,I'll see you later.
All righ see ya.

25:42.669 --> 25:44.431
See, that is what I'm talking about.

25:44.603 --> 25:46.461
Aw, come on, man.
That ain't nothing special.

25:46.551 --> 25:48.175
My doorman gives me the same love.

25:48.264 --> 25:49.798
Because you pay him to.

25:54.054 --> 25:55.013
Hey.

25:55.562 --> 25:56.673
(Nick) hey.

25:58.866 --> 26:02.821
I was just at your office,
dropping off some cds that ronnie let me borrow.

26:03.070 --> 26:05.678
Oh. Oh, aubrey,this is my agent, stratton lorb.

26:05.781 --> 26:08.070
Stratton, this is aubrey.
Hi.

26:08.218 --> 26:11.397
She's got some mad skills when it comes to turning a phrase.
Oh, um...

26:11.496 --> 26:12.839
you should take a look at her novel.

26:12.974 --> 26:13.680
Be a pleasure.

26:13.784 --> 26:14.881
Are you serious?

26:14.979 --> 26:17.691
Of course. I love books.

26:17.878 --> 26:19.676
You know, we should all hang out tonight.
Sure.

26:19.778 --> 26:21.368
You know, maybe get a drink at sully'S.
Yeah.

26:21.465 --> 26:23.689
Yeah, aubrey can give you her manuscript,

26:24.587 --> 26:27.781
and I can convince you to take your long car back to manhattan.
Okay?

26:27.996 --> 26:30.975
Sounds planny.
All right, sully's at 8:00.

26:31.124 --> 26:33.325
Really great to meet you.
As well.

26:33.570 --> 26:34.915
See you later, teach.
Okay.

26:35.030 --> 26:36.060
Bye.
Bye.

26:36.203 --> 26:39.628
Wow. Between hannah anna,

26:39.779 --> 26:42.330
pizza longstockings and aubrey hepburn,

26:42.458 --> 26:45.064
I just got one very importantquestion to ask you, doc.

26:45.065 --> 26:45.994
Yeah, what's that,
stratton?

26:46.096 --> 26:48.526
You know of any apartments I could rent around here?

26:52.705 --> 26:53.946
After being married to a gay guy,

26:54.061 --> 26:56.420
I bet you she's ready to deal with a real man, yeah?

26:56.597 --> 26:57.364
yeah.

26:57.471 --> 26:58.863
I mean, screw eddie latekka.

26:59.024 --> 27:02.273
I'd be happy to take his old high school sports car out for a little spin.

27:02.866 --> 27:04.991
It's the least I could dright?Sure.

27:05.713 --> 27:09.067
You know what, though? I think it's time for a little payback.

27:09.223 --> 27:10.259
What do you think, boys?

27:10.890 --> 27:13.649
How about we have a little talk with latekka tonig, huh?

27:13.791 --> 27:16.040
Let's do it.
Let's do it.All right.

27:16.607 --> 27:17.793
rory's super nice,

27:17.913 --> 27:20.557
but she and eddie were the golden couple back in high school.

27:21.179 --> 27:22.372
Not to toot my own horn,

27:22.462 --> 27:24.242
but I thought that nick and i were the golden couple.

27:24.367 --> 27:27.253
You and nick were the couple everyone wanted to be friends with.

27:27.392 --> 27:30.446
Rory and eddie were the couple everyone wanted to be.

27:31.673 --> 27:33.658
Okay, but that's all in the past, janet.

27:33.789 --> 27:35.804
Rory and eddie had a connection back then

27:35.915 --> 27:38.195
who's to say those emotions won't come racing back?

27:39.042 --> 27:41.003
I can't compete with that kind of history.

27:41.145 --> 27:42.783
You can get past the past.

27:42.925 --> 27:44.857
Look at me and ray.
We're getting married.

27:45.475 --> 27:46.818
People move on, janet.

27:47.438 --> 27:48.834
They happily move on.

27:49.967 --> 27:51.002
I know.

27:51.756 --> 27:55.366
I just... don't know if eddie's one of those people.

28:13.179 --> 28:13.797
hi.

28:13.926 --> 28:18.527
Hi. I, um, picked up some beer and two strombolis from goombah'S.

28:19.051 --> 28:20.087
Can we talk?

28:20.688 --> 28:24.005
How can I say no to beer and strombolis?

28:24.170 --> 28:26.424
That would be slightly irresponsible of you.

28:27.591 --> 28:29.947
Don't forget it was hannah that threw the first punch.

28:30.437 --> 28:33.512
It's unseemly you would cry flnow that the gloves are off.

28:33.647 --> 28:34.961
The only reason this is an issue

28:35.077 --> 28:36.858
is because of the engagement announcement.

28:36.997 --> 28:38.684
You're just not happy unless everyone's as miserable as you are.

28:38.768 --> 28:40.494
I don't understand what all this is about.

28:40.620 --> 28:42.785
Hannah assaulted me, ray.

28:42.902 --> 28:46.394
The woman you plan on marrying is violent and quick-tempered.
You provoked her.

28:46.525 --> 28:49.712
Even if I did, that's no excuse for her lack of restraint.

28:50.697 --> 28:52.848
Children often provoke their parents.

28:52.932 --> 28:55.337
What is she raises a hand against jasper or casper?

28:55.655 --> 28:56.989
hannah would never do that.

28:57.117 --> 28:59.423
Well, I'm not willing to take that chance.

29:00.751 --> 29:03.612
If you really plan on marrying that girl, I...

29:04.603 --> 29:06.235
there's nothing I can do about that.

29:06.324 --> 29:09.008
But I'm not about to let you put our children in harm's way.

29:10.442 --> 29:13.723
I'm petitioning the court for full custody of jasper and casper.

29:14.884 --> 29:18.415
You can have hannah... or the boys.

29:18.990 --> 29:21.027
But you cannot have both.

29:27.906 --> 29:28.854
I'm sorry.

29:29.475 --> 29:30.861
girlfriend?

29:31.562 --> 29:34.675
No, it's ikey,
which is strange.

29:34.817 --> 29:36.981
Why is that strange? You guys aren't friends anymore?

29:38.278 --> 29:40.114
Ikey's kinda on the outs.

29:40.234 --> 29:42.052
He slept with owen rowan's wife.

29:42.208 --> 29:43.556
No way.

29:44.157 --> 29:45.279
That's awful.

29:45.386 --> 29:47.774
Yeah, it sucked... for everyone.

29:47.907 --> 29:50.180
That's too bad.
You guys were so close.

29:50.695 --> 29:53.941
You know, it's weird how some things are completely different now,

29:54.071 --> 29:56.223
and others are the exact same...

29:56.384 --> 29:57.973
like these strombolis.

29:59.059 --> 30:01.460
Yeah, I-I haven't had these in years.

30:02.300 --> 30:03.509
As good as you remember?

30:03.639 --> 30:05.331
Mmm, pretty da good.

30:07.955 --> 30:11.410
You ever think about how different our lives would be
if I never left the ridge?

30:12.331 --> 30:15.771
Maybe we'd be married now or have a family.

30:16.375 --> 30:18.983
Rory, I...
look, I just...

30:19.898 --> 30:21.580
I wanna say I'm sorry--

30:21.732 --> 30:24.889
sorry for being so selfish and misguided.

30:25.477 --> 30:28.617
But in the end,I got exactly what I deserved--

30:28.759 --> 30:31.390
a ginormous servingof karmic payback.

30:31.528 --> 30:33.144
Come on. We were kids.

30:33.850 --> 30:35.285
If you're gonna get your heart broken,

30:35.387 --> 30:36.572
best be done when you're young.

30:36.666 --> 30:40.144
Yeah,but looking back on it,
I never really felt like a kid back then.

30:40.519 --> 30:43.163
But I do feel a little like one now.

30:45.164 --> 30:47.829
Searching everyone

30:49.061 --> 30:51.199
they say love conquers all

30:51.327 --> 30:53.407
you can't start it like a car

30:53.527 --> 30:55.597
you can't stop it with a gun

31:00.896 --> 31:02.221
we should stop.

31:02.372 --> 31:05.153
Yeah, we--we should, 'cause I wouldn't be kissing you.

31:05.247 --> 31:08.134
I'd be kissing jake...or the memory of jake.

31:08.269 --> 31:09.621
Yeah, I wouldn't be kissing you, either.

31:09.700 --> 31:12.814
I'd be... kissing senior year

31:13.408 --> 31:15.077
and the way things usedo be.

31:15.782 --> 31:20.918
Yeah,senior year and jake,edgar, the way things used to be...

31:21.507 --> 31:23.445
suddenly this is starting to sound like an orgy.

31:25.587 --> 31:27.111
I should go.

31:28.383 --> 31:30.587
Hey, rory, I...

31:31.798 --> 31:34.154
you should know I'm seeing someone.

31:35.782 --> 31:37.287
I'm not surprised.

31:38.606 --> 31:39.991
She's a lucky girl.

31:42.044 --> 31:44.098
She is a girl, right?

31:52.714 --> 31:54.147
this is good pie.

31:54.952 --> 31:56.128
Where'd you get it?

31:56.264 --> 31:57.951
Oh, I picked it up from holly'S.

31:58.057 --> 32:01.581
Mmm. It's good.Holly's is .
Mmm. Pretty good.

32:03.370 --> 32:06.004
how many times do I have to ask you to turn off

32:06.142 --> 32:08.189
that godforsakaken contraption for the 40 odd minutes

32:08.275 --> 32:10.009
it takes us to have a family dinner?

32:10.729 --> 32:12.416
Whoa. Sorry.

32:16.439 --> 32:17.600
everything okay?

32:19.011 --> 32:20.319
Sure.

32:20.568 --> 32:22.940
Ronnie, could you passthe whipped cream, please?

32:23.091 --> 32:24.506
I have cancer.

32:29.013 --> 32:30.127
What did you just say?

32:30.248 --> 32:31.808
I have cancer.

32:35.030 --> 32:37.052
Bone marrow cancer.

32:41.515 --> 32:43.236
but they caught it in time.

32:43.940 --> 32:46.499
The docs say I can beat it.

32:47.182 --> 32:48.814
The treatment's, um...

32:50.811 --> 32:52.272
gonna make me feel like crap.

32:52.371 --> 32:55.246
So I'll probably be a bigger pain in the ass than I usually am.

32:58.208 --> 33:00.997
I wanna apologize to you boys for that in advance.

33:04.909 --> 33:09.979
Dad... I mean, how can you just sit there and be--
I know you have a lot of questions, but, um...

33:12.563 --> 33:15.832
for now, could we just enjoy our pie?

33:28.873 --> 33:30.202
can she do that--

33:30.349 --> 33:32.739
just take
jasper and casper away?

33:33.331 --> 33:35.140
I'll get into it
with the lawyer inhe morning.

33:36.183 --> 33:38.232
The truth is,
you did hit christine.

33:38.348 --> 33:39.815
She has
a legitimate complaint.

33:39.915 --> 33:42.560
Okay, fine, then I'll just--
I'll apologize to her, then.

33:42.595 --> 33:46.495
It won't matter. She already
got what she wanted--leverage.

33:46.610 --> 33:48.453
Nothing we do athis point
is gonna change that.

33:48.567 --> 33:51.900
I feel so stupid
and mapulated.

33:52.776 --> 33:54.218
welcome to my world.

33:57.884 --> 33:59.443
We'll get through this.

34:00.649 --> 34:03.103
I'll talk to the lawyer,
and we'll work it out.

34:13.730 --> 34:15.478
I got your message.

34:16.275 --> 34:18.645
Unfortunately, the only liquor
I had at the house

34:18.779 --> 34:22.004
is my cousin barney's self-distilled corn whiskey,

34:22.179 --> 34:25.224
which is fine if you wanna
clean a carburetor.
It'll do.

34:31.076 --> 34:32.309
I can give you a ride home
if you want.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.159
I gotta stop by
the window shop anyway.

34:34.581 --> 34:36.806
Oh, it's a nice night.
I think I'll just walk.

34:37.320 --> 34:39.194
You take care of yourself,
all right?

34:39.911 --> 34:41.362
That's why I'm here.

34:54.246 --> 34:55.684
Maybe you should
slow down.

34:55.818 --> 34:58.863
That stuff can make
blind men more blind.

35:01.178 --> 35:02.873
Maybe you need tjoin me.

35:04.004 --> 35:06.380
I'm happy to be
your booze buddy, but...

35:07.023 --> 35:11.135
maybe using our lips
to talk instead of drink
might be more beneficial.

35:11.903 --> 35:13.522
I have a question.

35:14.151 --> 35:16.758
Why did you kiss me
when we did the dry run thing?

35:16.865 --> 35:19.121
I take it back.
Talking's way overrated.

35:19.250 --> 35:20.855
Seriously.

35:20.997 --> 35:22.754
Why did you kiss me?

35:22.902 --> 35:24.957
What do you see in me
anyway?

35:25.113 --> 35:26.408
M not pretty,

35:26.978 --> 35:28.280
I'm not smart,

35:28.370 --> 35:31.280
and I'm definitely not good
at preventing my boyfriend

35:31.404 --> 35:33.575
from hooking up with his prom date.

35:40.375 --> 35:41.912
the best part about you.

35:42.135 --> 35:45.173
Is that you
always remember me.

35:46.096 --> 35:47.459
Every year since I was 12,

35:47.543 --> 35:49.701
you've had a card for me
on my birthday.

35:50.323 --> 35:52.361
When I locked myself
in the beer cellar...

35:53.011 --> 35:55.363
was you that noticed
I was missing.

35:55.528 --> 35:58.451
I've always been
an in-the-background
kind of guy, but...

36:00.031 --> 36:04.001
you always make me feel
like I'm front and center.

36:06.640 --> 36:09.529
I just wish I could
make you feel theame way.

36:40.483 --> 36:42.178
ahem.

36:48.309 --> 36:50.057
It's in his bones.

36:52.199 --> 36:53.322
I mean, how do you--

36:53.433 --> 36:55.625
how do you fight somhing
that is

36:55.770 --> 36:57.925
that deep inside you?

37:03.175 --> 37:05.253
it's like ma
all over again.

37:10.216 --> 37:12.231
We're not gonna be orphans,
nicky.I mean,

37:12.335 --> 37:14.901
I don't--
I don't wanna be an orphan.

37:23.277 --> 37:25.204
I'm glad you're here.

37:26.973 --> 37:31.019
I'm the man
on the mountain

37:31.328 --> 37:36.210
come on up

37:39.143 --> 37:43.285
I'm the plowman
in the valley

37:45.594 --> 37:47.503
how's it hanging, bro?

37:49.819 --> 37:55.646
Yes, I'm fumbling
and I know my car
don't start

37:55.936 --> 38:01.492
yes, I'm stumbling
and I know
I play a bad guitar

38:02.886 --> 38:04.841
give me little drink

38:05.459 --> 38:08.417
from your loving cup

38:09.519 --> 38:11.475
just one drink

38:12.173 --> 38:16.551
and I'll fall down drunk

38:20.642 --> 38:24.313
I'm the man who walks
the hillside

38:24.526 --> 38:29.208
in the sweet summer sun

38:32.357 --> 38:36.193
I'm the man
who brings you roses

38:36.737 --> 38:41.430
when you ain't got none

38:43.025 --> 38:46.012
well, I can run and jump
and fish

38:46.138 --> 38:51.009
but I won't fight you
if you want to push

38:51.122 --> 38:54.890
and pull with me
all night

38:55.947 --> 38:57.672
give me little drink

38:58.834 --> 39:01.378
from your loving cup

39:02.858 --> 39:04.751
just one drink

39:05.502 --> 39:09.592
and I'll fall down drunk

39:14.504 --> 39:20.326
yes, am nitty-gritty
and my shirt's all torn

39:20.600 --> 39:26.365
but I would love to spill
the beans with you
till dawn

39:27.877 --> 39:29.918
give me little drink

39:30.768 --> 39:33.499
From your loving cup

39:34.591 --> 39:36.816
just one drink

39:39.899 --> 39:42.406
hey! Eddie! Eddie!

39:43.587 --> 39:45.578
hey! Eddie!

39:54.173 --> 39:55.620
we're ready
for another round.

39:55.717 --> 39:57.589
What are you having,
doctor?

39:59.230 --> 40:01.666
Make the call. I'm in.

40:02.334 --> 40:03.865
I'll go on the tour.

40:04.588 --> 40:06.611
It's about time.

40:11.300 --> 40:12.745
what tour?

40:12.922 --> 40:17.915
Oh, what a beautiful buzz

40:18.065 --> 40:23.201
what a beautiful buzz

40:24.256 --> 40:26.299
I can see it in the way you look at me.

40:27.469 --> 40:28.750
You're thinking,

40:29.382 --> 40:31.666
"I don't agree with the choices that you've made, hannah.

40:32.731 --> 40:36.402
How could a young woman make such a muddle of her own life?"

40:37.054 --> 40:39.721
And that's your right to think those things.

40:40.917 --> 40:45.801
But it's also my right to insist, in this moment,that you hear me o.

40:46.940 --> 40:49.576
You punched me in the face,
bitch.

40:51.301 --> 40:53.845
I did.
in front of my children,

40:53.952 --> 40:56.581
in front of my ex-husband,
in front of your own son.

40:56.662 --> 40:59.162
And for that,I was wrong.

41:00.070 --> 41:03.866
You and ray are welcome to go down whatever primrose path you choose.

41:04.481 --> 41:06.301
But I'm the mother of his children,

41:06.459 --> 41:08.503
and I'm not gonna let you take my boys with you.

41:08.587 --> 41:10.335
You see, that is where you're wrong, christine,

41:10.437 --> 41:12.277
because your boys are a part of this.

41:12.430 --> 41:14.738
How can they not be when I'm marrying their father?

41:16.516 --> 41:19.512
This is an invitation to an engagement party for me and ray.

41:19.668 --> 41:22.582
It's this saturday,and don't worry about R.S.V.P.,

41:22.667 --> 41:25.727
Because I already have you down,plus two--jasper and casper.

41:25.845 --> 41:28.174
Because no matter what we may think of each other deep down,

41:29.258 --> 41:32.316
and no matter how agonizing this scenario is for the both of us,

41:32.446 --> 41:37.788
???quietly endure.

41:39.029 --> 41:41.048
Thank you for your time,
christine.

41:41.659 --> 41:42.693
See you on saturday.

41:42.787 --> 41:44.369
put me on a plane,

41:44.513 --> 41:47.542
fly me to anywhere

41:48.198 --> 41:49.801
put me on a plane

41:49.944 --> 41:53.080
fly me to anywhere

41:53.677 --> 41:54.984
put me on a plane

41:55.097 --> 41:57.911
fly me to anywhere

41:58.034 --> 42:00.086
eddie, it's me.
Where are you?

42:00.216 --> 42:01.833
I tried you, like,six times.

42:02.017 --> 42:04.950
We need to talk.All me.

42:08.480 --> 42:10.691
I don't know about you,but I am spent.

42:11.626 --> 42:14.906
It's not like either of us got much sleep last night.
Stop it, rooster.

42:15.315 --> 42:16.730
Tired though I may be,

42:16.836 --> 42:20.736
I feel invigorated,a happy stupor,

42:20.848 --> 42:22.627
bleary-eyed and wobbly boned,

42:22.733 --> 42:27.076
but energized to stumble into the great tomorrow with my new lady love.

42:27.729 --> 42:29.297
you slept with another guy's girlfriend.

42:29.387 --> 42:31.614
That's not something either of us should be gloating about.

42:31.739 --> 42:34.788
Mae that should factor somewhere into your stupid stupor.

42:35.969 --> 42:38.928
Copy that. Understandable.
We'll move right past it.

42:43.233 --> 42:44.127
hello.

42:44.773 --> 42:45.800
Hi, nick.

42:47.531 --> 42:48.946
What?

42:57.208 --> 42:59.667
janet's on her way.
thanks, buY.

42:59.786 --> 43:02.513
Eddie said that ikey's the one that brought him to the hospital,

43:02.610 --> 43:05.183
showed up right after the beat-down.
He had to know it was coming.

43:05.249 --> 43:06.557
Hey, maybe he was trying to stop it.

43:06.654 --> 43:07.911
I'll tell you one thing.

43:08.029 --> 43:10.649
Ray taldo has officially stepped into the wtang.

43:10.720 --> 43:14.203
We don't know th ray had anything to do with this.
Matt lauche is his boy.

43:14.344 --> 43:17.064
There's no way you're gonna deny me unleashing the wu-tang.

43:17.180 --> 43:21.331
No way. I get to call the play on this one, owen.
I'm calling a stand-down.

43:21.470 --> 43:24.416
And we got all the time in the world for retribution.

43:25.496 --> 43:39.088
Keep pouring in   and scream at night  to make them go away

43:42.442 --> 43:44.311
so put me on a plane

43:44.458 --> 43:47.234
fly me to anywher

43:48.052 --> 43:49.737
put me on a plane

43:49.863 --> 43:53.103
fly me to anywhere

43:53.210 --> 43:54.965
so put me on a ane

43:56.351 --> 43:58.360
...new york city. Here's my guy.

44:04.155 --> 44:05.042
how is he?

44:05.177 --> 44:07.379
Well, his spirits are tter than his jawbone,

44:07.459 --> 44:09.874
so... there's that.

44:09.976 --> 44:11.017
Happy up, people.

44:11.132 --> 44:14.762
"Freddy venetta was carved out of greek marble with inexpensive scotc

44:14.905 --> 44:15.891
flowing through his veins."

44:15.974 --> 44:17.727
Stratton, you gotta stop quoting the book.

44:17.820 --> 44:19.367
I'm just saying he'll get good quick.

44:19.461 --> 44:22.421
I'm just saying, it's--
hey, did you tell eddie?

44:24.564 --> 44:25.520
It wasn't the right time.

44:25.672 --> 44:26.727
Really?

44:27.395 --> 44:28.888
When is the right time?

44:28.976 --> 44:31.751
When is the precise moment that you let your best friend/

44:31.879 --> 44:34.192
business partner know that you're fixing to bail

44:34.303 --> 44:37.633
on everything and everyone you finally got good with again?

44:37.748 --> 44:38.581
Aubrey.

44:38.692 --> 44:40.075
When is the right time?

44:43.151 --> 44:45.510
You should really,really have an answer, nick,

44:45.621 --> 44:47.361
because you're still gonna have to tell your family

44:47.442 --> 44:49.395
that you're not gonna be around

44:49.493 --> 44:51.299
while your dad is trying to beat cancer.

44:51.398 --> 44:54.875
I'll only be gone for five months, okay?

44:55.014 --> 44:55.983
I'll be back.

44:56.064 --> 44:57.971
You know the thing about those five months?

44:58.082 --> 45:00.286
They will be the worst five months ever.

45:00.420 --> 45:01.949
They will be for your dad,

45:02.030 --> 45:03.093
they will be for eddie,

45:03.178 --> 45:05.313
they will be for all of us who re naive enough

45:05.416 --> 45:09.377
to believe that you were finally starting to find your soul.
