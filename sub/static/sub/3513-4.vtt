01:08.134 --> 01:11.445
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:17.110 --> 01:21.616
She's still breathing.
Call 911. Hurry up. Call 911.

01:37.897 --> 01:39.035
Kiss me.

01:40.900 --> 01:44.040
Hello. Yeah,
I was in a car accident

01:44.104 --> 01:47.551
and a woman got hit.
She's hurt really bad.

01:50.076 --> 01:51.680
She's just lying on the ground.

02:01.688 --> 02:03.531
She's still breathing.

02:20.340 --> 02:22.286
Driver of the car is Leroy Kent.

02:22.342 --> 02:23.548
Says he's driving home from work,

02:23.610 --> 02:25.248
drives onto the bridge,
sees the victim running,

02:25.311 --> 02:26.483
she runs right in front of his car.

02:26.546 --> 02:28.583
Says it happened so fast,
couldn't do anything.

02:28.648 --> 02:29.752
Get an ID on the vic?

02:29.816 --> 02:31.693
No wallet, no purse.
Looks like she just got out of bed.

02:31.751 --> 02:33.162
Did Mr. Kent have
anything to drink?

02:33.219 --> 02:34.789
He's had a couple,
but he's under the limit.

02:34.854 --> 02:36.663
Any witnesses? Well,

02:36.723 --> 02:37.827
driver said there
was one other guy.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.371
Told him to call 911,
but he didn't stick around.

02:40.426 --> 02:42.372
We got guys out
doing a canvass now.

02:42.428 --> 02:44.339
Mr. Kent. Yes.

02:44.898 --> 02:46.206
How are you feeling?

02:46.266 --> 02:47.404
ls she dead?

02:48.434 --> 02:49.469
Yeah.

02:49.802 --> 02:51.372
At first I thought
she might be okay.

02:51.437 --> 02:53.246
I mean, the guy said she
was still breathing.

02:53.306 --> 02:55.411
ls this the guy who
told you to call 911?

02:55.475 --> 02:58.718
Yes. I ran over there
as soon as it happened

02:59.045 --> 03:00.149
and he just walked up.

03:00.213 --> 03:01.351
Where'd he go?

03:02.348 --> 03:06.626
I don't know. I called 911,
I looked back, he was gone.

03:07.153 --> 03:08.393
Any idea what he looked like?

03:08.454 --> 03:09.865
Not really, no.

03:10.356 --> 03:15.101
I was pretty shook up.
I was paying attention to her.

03:17.096 --> 03:19.167
We're done, if you guys
want to take a look.

03:19.232 --> 03:20.336
Yeah.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.805
Thank you, Mr. Kent.

03:27.840 --> 03:30.377
Barefoot, ready for bed,
but still wearing makeup.

03:30.643 --> 03:32.316
Maybe she wasn't alone.

03:33.446 --> 03:34.754
We've got some glass here.

03:34.814 --> 03:36.725
Windshield didn't shatter and
headlights are still intact.

03:36.783 --> 03:38.057
This didn't come from the accident.

03:38.117 --> 03:39.619
There's no cuts or
abrasions on her feet.

03:39.686 --> 03:42.098
The guy said she was running.
She couldn't have run too far.

03:42.455 --> 03:43.991
I wonder where she was running to.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.934
Or what she was running from.

04:25.965 --> 04:27.342
I'll call when it's finished.

05:04.404 --> 05:06.179
Notice the iris is fully dilated,

05:06.239 --> 05:07.343
filling the eye completely.

05:07.573 --> 05:09.143
Looks like a shark's eye.
ls that normal?

05:09.208 --> 05:10.881
Well, there's usually
dilation after death,

05:10.943 --> 05:12.616
but I've never seen
anything like this before.

05:13.346 --> 05:14.450
You get a tox report?

05:14.514 --> 05:16.619
Preliminary says she had
a few drinks, not a lot.

05:16.683 --> 05:18.560
Alcohol was .06.

05:18.618 --> 05:19.722
What about drugs?

05:19.786 --> 05:21.424
So far none of the usual suspects.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.228
Finding the unusual is going
to take a little more time.

05:23.456 --> 05:24.958
Any sign of sexual assault?

05:25.558 --> 05:27.060
No. But there was
something interesting.

05:27.627 --> 05:29.072
No crush on the lungs.

05:29.128 --> 05:30.300
What does that mean?

05:30.363 --> 05:33.572
She was asphyxiated but it
wasn't a result of the accident.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.940
Someone suffocated her after
she was hit by the car?

05:37.503 --> 05:38.811
So we got a homicide?

05:38.871 --> 05:40.942
These contusions around
her nose and mouth,

05:41.007 --> 05:42.611
looks like somebody
pinched off her air.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.983
I got a hit on her prints.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.680
The victim's name was
Faith Collins. 33.

05:47.313 --> 05:49.520
Busted for a DUI a few months ago.
License was suspended.

05:49.582 --> 05:50.856
Get an address?

05:50.917 --> 05:52.521
About a mile away from
where she got hit.

05:52.585 --> 05:53.723
We knew she didn't run very far,

05:53.786 --> 05:55.663
so it makes sense that
she lived close by.

05:55.722 --> 05:56.962
Well, maybe she was
running from home.

05:57.023 --> 06:00.300
I think maybe she was running
from her husband, Roy Collins.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.771
Got a record for spousal abuse.

06:08.301 --> 06:09.336
You Roy Collins?

06:14.073 --> 06:16.644
What'd she tell you?
She saying I hit her?

06:16.709 --> 06:18.484
She didn't say anything.
Well, that's different.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.649
She usually complains
about everything I do.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.592
Well, she's not going to
be complaining anymore.

06:23.683 --> 06:25.162
We found your wife's
body last night.

06:26.419 --> 06:29.025
What? Your wife's been murdered.

06:29.088 --> 06:30.431
Oh, no.

06:30.857 --> 06:33.736
I know this is difficult, but we need
to know the last time you saw her.

06:35.728 --> 06:37.332
Last night.

06:37.697 --> 06:39.472
What happened?

06:41.401 --> 06:44.245
I came home, and I was hungry.

06:44.871 --> 06:46.373
Faith wouldn't get off the
computer, like always.

06:46.472 --> 06:48.543
She's got to connect
with her 322 friends.

06:48.608 --> 06:51.646
I mean, who the hell's
got 322 friends?

06:52.278 --> 06:54.349
I mean, I'm hungry.
I've been working all day.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.916
So you argued? Yeah.

06:56.149 --> 06:58.254
And she walked out, you know, mad.

06:58.317 --> 07:00.524
I didn't mean anything I said.

07:00.887 --> 07:01.991
Well, did she tell you
where she was going?

07:02.054 --> 07:03.089
No. You go after her?

07:03.423 --> 07:05.494
No. NICK: About what
time did she leave?

07:05.725 --> 07:08.706
I don't know, 10:00 or
something like that.

07:09.362 --> 07:11.239
So she left, you stayed home.
That's your story?

07:11.297 --> 07:12.742
It's the truth.

07:12.799 --> 07:14.506
Anybody see you?
You talk to anybody?

07:14.567 --> 07:16.069
No.

07:16.869 --> 07:18.940
I was waiting for her to come back.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.877
She always comes back.

07:26.012 --> 07:28.549
You guys think I did
something to her?

07:28.948 --> 07:30.791
You think I'd kill my wife?
Did you?

07:32.218 --> 07:33.390
Want to do yourself a favor?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.659
Why don't you come
downtown with us,

07:34.720 --> 07:37.826
we'll put you in a lineup.
What do you say?

07:37.890 --> 07:40.496
You want me for a lineup?
Arrest me.

07:41.227 --> 07:43.571
But you don't got anything on me,
'cause I didn't do it.

07:46.132 --> 07:47.270
Where is she?

07:47.967 --> 07:49.310
Her body's in the morgue.

07:51.204 --> 07:52.239
When do I get her?

07:53.139 --> 07:54.641
Somebody will contact you.

07:59.745 --> 08:00.815
What do you got?

08:00.880 --> 08:01.915
Well, according to her credit card,

08:01.981 --> 08:04.894
Faith had a couple drinks at a bar
called the Blue Moon at around 10:30.

08:04.951 --> 08:06.931
Bartender said she talked
up a couple locals,

08:06.986 --> 08:08.590
but she left alone.
She didn't have her car.

08:08.654 --> 08:09.758
Her license is suspended.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.699
We're checking with cab companies
now to see who picked her up.

08:11.757 --> 08:14.203
Called to the house four times
for domestic disturbance.

08:14.260 --> 08:15.967
The husband's been
arrested twice for abuse.

08:16.028 --> 08:18.235
I mean, it sounds like a battered
wife who couldn't break the cycle.

08:18.297 --> 08:19.469
You sure the husband's
not covering?

08:19.532 --> 08:21.671
Could be. He admits
to arguing with her.

08:21.734 --> 08:23.645
Any chance she talked
to a family member

08:23.703 --> 08:24.807
about her problems last night?

08:24.871 --> 08:26.282
No calls on her cell after 9:00.

08:26.506 --> 08:30.044
What about her 322 friends Maybe
she reached out to one of them.

08:31.744 --> 08:34.280
Hey, check it.
She posted last night.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.549
Looks like a park.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.653
Or a private garden.
What time did she send it?

08:38.717 --> 08:41.164
11:37. Now if this was
taken from her cell phone,

08:41.220 --> 08:45.168
the GPS coordinates should be
embedded in the file, right?

08:45.224 --> 08:47.500
1516 Longacre Road.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.005
Map it.

08:52.598 --> 08:55.511
That's right here.

08:55.835 --> 08:57.109
Right near the bridge.

08:57.169 --> 08:58.580
Definitely running distance.

09:00.239 --> 09:01.775
Click "location."

09:02.875 --> 09:04.718
"The Bramble Haus,
Bed and Breakfast."

09:05.077 --> 09:06.078
You know it?

09:06.379 --> 09:08.381
When do I have time for
a bed or breakfast?

09:09.282 --> 09:10.556
Let's check with the cab companies,

09:10.616 --> 09:14.189
see if they made any drop-offs
at a B&B you don't have time for.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.846
Not bad. You should make
time for a place like this.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.712
Check out this '67 MGB Roadster.

09:32.772 --> 09:34.547
You ready for a
little bit of trivia?

09:34.607 --> 09:36.314
Royal blue and chrome bumpers.

09:36.375 --> 09:38.377
Collectors call that
model right there

09:38.444 --> 09:40.355
"the most desirable MG ever made."

09:41.280 --> 09:42.759
Impressed? Mildly.

09:45.885 --> 09:47.125
Of course. Yes, I remember her.

09:47.186 --> 09:49.723
She came in, I'd say,
it was after 11:00.

09:49.789 --> 09:52.269
I was in the kitchen pulling
up some biscuits for breakfast

09:52.325 --> 09:54.566
and I heard the bell ring,
so I went and got the door.

09:54.627 --> 09:57.130
Oh! Excuse me a minute.

09:57.196 --> 09:58.539
I've got your bill right here.

09:58.598 --> 09:59.668
I hope everything
was to your liking.

09:59.732 --> 10:03.009
Oh, Billy, we just love this place.
It's so magical.

10:03.069 --> 10:04.104
Thank you. Thank you.

10:04.170 --> 10:05.205
Yeah, we'll see you
on our anniversary.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.410
I look forward to it.
And tell your friends.

10:07.473 --> 10:08.952
Five stars on Yelp.

10:09.575 --> 10:12.215
And, you two, you guys are
going to love this place.

10:14.614 --> 10:17.561
Newlyweds. They're a
third of my business.

10:17.617 --> 10:18.721
So, I'm sorry, where were we?

10:18.784 --> 10:19.854
The girl.

10:19.919 --> 10:21.523
Of course, right, yes. Um...

10:21.587 --> 10:23.362
I showed her a room and the garden.

10:23.422 --> 10:24.730
But she didn't stay?

10:24.790 --> 10:26.360
No, she didn't have a bag with her.

10:26.425 --> 10:27.631
I'm sorry is there a problem?

10:27.693 --> 10:29.730
A cab dropped her off
and didn't pick her up.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.468
Can you explain that?
I really don't know.

10:31.530 --> 10:33.703
I mean, if they don't want to stay,
I can't force them to.

10:33.766 --> 10:35.336
You know, to tell you the truth,

10:35.401 --> 10:38.109
she seemed a little bit
concerned or troubled.

10:38.170 --> 10:39.581
And it's not really my
place to get involved

10:39.639 --> 10:40.913
in guests' personal lives, so...

10:41.507 --> 10:42.577
Can we see the garden?

10:42.642 --> 10:44.588
Of course, yes. Oh...

10:44.644 --> 10:47.454
But I warn you,
you might want to stay.

10:49.548 --> 10:50.583
Oh! Excuse me.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.793
No problem.

11:04.930 --> 11:06.432
Hey.

11:12.405 --> 11:15.909
Yeah, this is the place.
She came here and then what?

11:16.108 --> 11:20.056
I showed her these amber roses
that bloom only in Portland,

11:20.112 --> 11:25.323
and my flowering wisteria.
And of course, the agapanthus,

11:25.384 --> 11:27.261
but don't get me started on those.

11:27.319 --> 11:28.992
And then she said she
wanted to sit for a moment

11:29.055 --> 11:30.966
and gather her thoughts
so I said that this...

11:31.023 --> 11:33.060
Be careful where you step!
That's...

11:34.794 --> 11:36.967
Sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

12:02.388 --> 12:05.164
The toad is an endangered species.

12:05.224 --> 12:07.431
It's the first sign of our
extinction when toads die.

12:07.626 --> 12:09.469
I'm sorry. I didn't see it.

12:11.931 --> 12:14.275
Well, if you can think
of anything else.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.813
Of course. Yes,
I'll contact you immediately.

12:17.570 --> 12:18.571
Would you like me to show you out?

12:18.637 --> 12:19.980
No. We're good.

12:21.640 --> 12:22.641
Hey.

12:28.314 --> 12:29.452
Have a good day.

12:44.163 --> 12:45.767
That's all I got, Jim.

12:45.831 --> 12:48.141
Let me know if you need
anything else, yeah?

12:54.707 --> 12:55.811
Can I help you?

12:55.875 --> 12:58.788
Yes. I'm looking into the
death of a friend of mine.

12:58.844 --> 13:01.120
He was shot by one
of your detectives.

13:01.180 --> 13:02.784
Are you a lawyer? No.

13:02.848 --> 13:04.020
Just a friend of the family.

13:04.383 --> 13:06.385
Here's the newspaper article.
I brought it along

13:06.452 --> 13:07.897
so you'd know what I
was talking about.

13:08.220 --> 13:09.790
Take a seat, please.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.897
He wants to talk to the
officer who shot his friend.

13:15.761 --> 13:17.001
What did you tell him?

13:17.062 --> 13:19.508
I told him we don't give out that
information. Sir, he's waiting.

13:19.565 --> 13:20.873
How do you want me to handle this?

13:21.333 --> 13:22.676
Tell him the detective's
not available,

13:22.735 --> 13:25.272
that someone from the
department will get back to him.

13:25.337 --> 13:26.611
Yes, sir.

13:26.672 --> 13:28.481
Make sure to get his name,
number and address.

13:29.041 --> 13:30.611
Do a background check
and get back to me.

13:42.021 --> 13:44.695
The cab picked her up from the bar,
but why did she go to the Bramble Haus?

13:44.757 --> 13:46.498
She was probably just
looking for a place to stay

13:46.559 --> 13:48.300
so she wouldn't have
to go back home.

13:48.360 --> 13:49.634
Cab driver could
have recommended it.

13:49.695 --> 13:50.901
What does it matter,
she didn't stay.

13:50.963 --> 13:51.964
That's what we need to find out.

13:52.031 --> 13:53.408
She went there,
but she didn't stay.

13:53.465 --> 13:54.705
And she didn't call
for another cab.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.610
So you're thinking she ran
from there to the bridge.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.979
I think we have to run a
background check on Billy Capra.

13:59.038 --> 14:00.813
See if any other women have
had trouble at his place.

14:00.873 --> 14:04.787
Also, run a check on unsolved
attacks on women or missing women.

14:22.394 --> 14:24.897
"June, 1895.

14:25.731 --> 14:28.575
"Kitzbuhel Alps,
south of Rattenberg.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.080
"I have followed and observed

14:31.136 --> 14:33.639
"a goat-like creature
for several days now.

14:34.306 --> 14:37.344
"I have finally been able to
identify him as a Ziegevolk.

14:37.810 --> 14:39.721
"Sometimes known as Bluebeards.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.987
"I now know he is responsible
for defiling several women

14:43.048 --> 14:46.188
"who seemed to fallen
under some sort of spell.

14:50.522 --> 14:52.399
"I have not yet been
able to determine

14:52.458 --> 14:54.768
"how such an oafish
man is so attractive

14:54.827 --> 14:56.636
"to these poor young women."

15:26.859 --> 15:27.997
Really?

15:28.060 --> 15:30.006
Look, if I had anybody
else I could talk to

15:30.062 --> 15:31.405
about this stuff, I'd go there.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.770
I feel like I should complain,

15:33.832 --> 15:37.803
but I'm just not in that
mode right now. Come on.

15:43.309 --> 15:45.118
You know anything about Ziegevolk?

15:45.177 --> 15:47.919
A little. They're
mostly like preachers,

15:47.980 --> 15:50.483
game-show hosts,
you know? Actor types, you know?

15:50.549 --> 15:52.927
Guys who like to be in the public eye.
Why? Did one goat out on you?

15:53.452 --> 15:54.829
Yeah. Do you know some?

15:54.887 --> 15:57.299
I knew one. In high school.

15:57.356 --> 15:59.962
Elvis Greenspan.
Got all the chicks,

16:00.025 --> 16:02.369
like every hottie in school, okay?

16:02.428 --> 16:05.272
Kid was 5'4",
weighed in at like 280.

16:05.331 --> 16:08.778
It's hard to believe, but Ziegevolk
give off this, sort of, scent.

16:08.834 --> 16:10.336
You mean like pheromones?

16:10.402 --> 16:12.780
Yeah. They secrete it in
their sweat or something.

16:12.838 --> 16:14.112
Chicks can't resist it.

16:14.173 --> 16:16.414
And if one of these
goat guys touches you,

16:16.475 --> 16:19.115
look out, man. They own you.

16:19.178 --> 16:20.384
Why do you think
those Hollywood types

16:20.446 --> 16:21.754
are always hugging
everybody, right?

16:21.847 --> 16:23.155
Would they ever kill?

16:23.215 --> 16:25.252
No. Bluebeards have got a bad rap.

16:25.317 --> 16:27.797
They're lovers,
not fighters, you know?

16:27.853 --> 16:29.298
They like to have a lot of females

16:29.355 --> 16:31.164
hanging off their every word.

16:31.590 --> 16:33.570
Not exactly the
monogamous type, you know?

16:33.625 --> 16:34.626
They live for the rut.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.104
The what? The rut.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.970
Picking out the choicest
females, you know?

16:38.030 --> 16:39.600
For breeding.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.338
You see them in bars all the time.

16:41.400 --> 16:45.280
They're players,
one night stand type guys.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.162
What are you thinking?

16:59.218 --> 17:03.496
I'm just wondering why certain
people are attracted to each other?

17:03.555 --> 17:05.159
It's all about chemistry.

17:05.223 --> 17:07.602
Oh! Well, that explains
Dale Armistead.

17:07.659 --> 17:09.969
The guy who stole your...

17:10.429 --> 17:12.636
Guy, your first love.

17:12.698 --> 17:13.801
That wasn't love.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.073
Well, it certainly wasn't
looks or intelligence.

17:16.135 --> 17:17.910
You're one to talk.
I met your first girlfriend.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.382
Okay, that was not chemistry,
that was stupidity.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.244
Well, how do you know you're not
being stupid by being with me?

17:23.308 --> 17:27.551
I don't. I just... I think that
there's a lot more to it than that.

17:28.580 --> 17:33.620
You know, in biology,
like systems tend to integrate.

17:33.685 --> 17:35.358
That's so romantic.

17:35.421 --> 17:37.992
How about we get the shopping
done and go home and integrate?

17:38.057 --> 17:40.503
Give me the list and
get the car started.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.808
Lab results on the glass removed
from the gashes on Faith's arm.

17:49.868 --> 17:51.438
It was regular window glass.

17:51.503 --> 17:53.676
So it must have come from
a house or an apartment.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.241
Maybe she was trying to
break out of a window.

17:55.307 --> 17:57.253
Well, we know she was
running from something.

17:57.309 --> 17:59.084
What do you got on Capra?

17:59.144 --> 18:00.885
Well, all I got is
that he moved into town

18:00.946 --> 18:03.620
about a year and a half ago,
bought the bed and breakfast.

18:03.682 --> 18:06.026
I'm having a little trouble
on the background before that.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.122
I think our boy must
have changed his name.

18:08.187 --> 18:10.690
But I did get a hell of
a hit on missing women

18:10.756 --> 18:12.895
here in Portland in
the last six months.

18:12.958 --> 18:14.301
One came from Los Angeles,

18:14.359 --> 18:16.305
another from Seattle,
and a third from Eugene.

18:16.361 --> 18:17.396
All open cases.

18:17.463 --> 18:19.409
Are there other clusters
like this in other cities?

18:19.465 --> 18:21.376
I think we'd better find out.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.745
It's the same story with
each one of these women.

18:25.804 --> 18:28.216
They all came here in the
last four months and vanished.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.946
Any record of these women
staying at Capra's place?

18:30.008 --> 18:33.217
No, but then we figured he wouldn't
want any record of them staying there.

18:33.278 --> 18:34.518
And we think Faith
got away from him,

18:34.580 --> 18:35.752
then he hunted her
down and killed her.

18:36.248 --> 18:38.785
We also found three other
clusters of missing women.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.888
One in Detroit four years ago,
seven women there.

18:41.854 --> 18:43.663
Another batch in Des
Moines two years ago.

18:43.722 --> 18:46.726
Six women there.
And four women in Tucson in 2000.

18:46.792 --> 18:47.930
Here's the really weird thing,

18:47.993 --> 18:51.372
all 17 women were eventually found alive,
14 of them pregnant.

18:51.430 --> 18:54.343
The DNA checked out to be the
same father for each one.

18:54.399 --> 18:56.538
So we got ourselves a serial rapist,
not a serial killer.

18:56.602 --> 18:58.309
This guy is definitely a breeder.

18:58.604 --> 19:01.278
Well, can you connect him to
Des Moines, Detroit, Tucson?

19:01.340 --> 19:04.514
We're working on it. We think he changes
his identity every time he moves.

19:04.576 --> 19:05.850
Any of the women
able to identify him?

19:05.911 --> 19:07.913
No. Every testimony
made it sound like

19:07.980 --> 19:09.357
they were kept in
isolated conditions

19:09.414 --> 19:11.394
using some kind of gas
to keep them disoriented.

19:11.683 --> 19:13.959
They didn't know where they
were or who was holding them.

19:14.019 --> 19:16.431
If this is the same guy here in Portland,
we need to be watching him.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.534
Well, you guys keep watch,
and just make sure he doesn't burn you.

19:19.591 --> 19:21.093
We're on it.

20:13.111 --> 20:14.215
Bon appétit.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.173
Piece of cake. We're good to go.

21:10.235 --> 21:11.873
We can track this guy anywhere.

21:13.505 --> 21:14.506
Working.

21:15.007 --> 21:16.179
We're set.

21:16.241 --> 21:18.243
Now all we got to do is wait.

21:19.811 --> 21:21.688
Wake me when something happens.

21:26.618 --> 21:27.688
Wake up. Not funny.

21:27.753 --> 21:29.699
No, he's coming out. What?

21:38.330 --> 21:39.468
He's not taking the car?

21:39.531 --> 21:41.511
He's got to take the damn
car I just got under the car

21:41.566 --> 21:42.943
and got a grease spot for nothing?

21:43.135 --> 21:44.409
All right, I'm going
to follow him on foot.

21:44.970 --> 21:46.449
You stay here,
take a look around the house.

21:46.505 --> 21:47.643
See if you can find
that broken window.

21:47.706 --> 21:51.244
That'll give us our warrant,
which will give us our DNA.

24:44.115 --> 24:45.116
Hello.

24:45.183 --> 24:46.856
Hey, it's Nick.

24:46.918 --> 24:49.057
How did you get my new cell phone?

24:49.120 --> 24:51.157
Are you kidding me? I'm a cop.

24:51.890 --> 24:52.891
I need your help.

24:54.526 --> 24:57.006
Seriously? I can pay you

24:57.062 --> 24:58.097
What do I got to do?

24:58.163 --> 25:00.404
All you have to do
is go to a bar...

25:00.465 --> 25:01.535
That I can do.

25:01.600 --> 25:04.046
...and watch a guy and
tell me what he does.

25:04.102 --> 25:05.877
Okay. Who's buying the drinks?

25:05.937 --> 25:06.938
Me.

25:07.005 --> 25:08.746
AH right. Where do I have to be?

25:09.841 --> 25:11.320
Blue Moon bar. You know it?

25:11.676 --> 25:14.179
Do I know it? Dude, I'm there.

25:31.663 --> 25:32.767
Shut the door.

25:34.466 --> 25:36.275
You should rethink this.

25:48.680 --> 25:52.218
First mistake was
coming to my city.

25:55.954 --> 25:59.265
Second mistake was not knowing
who you have to kneel before.

26:10.835 --> 26:13.543
Your fellow reaper brought
this death upon himself.

26:13.605 --> 26:17.178
He followed the Grimm here.
That gives him the right.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.778
He came without my permission.

26:19.344 --> 26:21.756
I claim my revenge for his death.

26:22.414 --> 26:25.691
Funny. I deny it.

26:28.153 --> 26:29.928
Are you protecting a Grimm?

27:21.940 --> 27:24.443
Okay, who am I supposed to be?

27:24.509 --> 27:25.647
Just yourself.

27:25.710 --> 27:26.950
That's a little disappointing.

27:27.012 --> 27:29.014
Okay, there's a
Ziegevolk in the bar.

27:29.080 --> 27:30.753
He's average height, kind of,
on the skinny side.

27:30.849 --> 27:33.352
I know a Ziegevolk
when I smell one, okay?

27:33.418 --> 27:34.761
All right, call me
when you get inside.

27:34.819 --> 27:37.299
I want to know what he
does and who he talks to.

27:37.355 --> 27:38.925
How come you're not doing this?

27:38.990 --> 27:40.128
He's seen me.

27:40.191 --> 27:42.296
He knows I'm a cop.
Plus, I want you to do it

27:42.360 --> 27:44.067
because you know about Ziegevolk.

27:44.129 --> 27:45.904
Oh! Grimm work.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.576
One more thing.

27:48.633 --> 27:50.169
I saw him eating a toad.

27:50.235 --> 27:51.407
Dude, he's a toad-eater?

27:51.469 --> 27:55.144
That means he's not just a breeder,
he's a herder, okay?

27:55.206 --> 27:56.981
That's actually very
rare for a Ziegevolk.

27:57.042 --> 27:59.750
Well, rare or not,
this guy is a serial rapist.

27:59.811 --> 28:01.017
You got to get inside.

28:01.079 --> 28:02.353
I need to know what he's doing.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.551
Okay.

28:12.157 --> 28:13.898
Seriously? Come on.

28:13.958 --> 28:16.268
That's like a beer and
half an onion ring.

28:17.028 --> 28:18.200
Half an onion ring.

28:53.598 --> 28:54.599
Got him.

28:54.666 --> 28:56.202
Well, what's he doing? Trolling.

28:56.434 --> 28:58.038
Talking to a very attractive woman.

28:58.103 --> 28:59.582
He's got game tonight.

29:00.638 --> 29:02.618
That must have been one
potent toad he ate.

29:02.674 --> 29:03.880
I can smell him from here.

29:04.309 --> 29:05.481
Well, can you get closer to him?

29:05.543 --> 29:06.647
I need to hear what he's saying.

29:06.811 --> 29:08.313
Check this out.

29:08.379 --> 29:10.359
I am moving in on the bar.

29:10.415 --> 29:11.485
Excuse me, pal.

29:12.117 --> 29:13.960
There's an opening
directly to her left.

29:14.018 --> 29:16.362
I'm about 20 feet from
the bar right now.

29:16.421 --> 29:17.456
I can be at the opening...

29:17.522 --> 29:20.230
Okay, I don't need to know
everything you're doing.

29:20.291 --> 29:22.669
Well, excuse me for being thorough.

29:22.761 --> 29:24.331
Sorry. I'm not talking to you.

29:26.898 --> 29:27.968
Yeah?

29:28.032 --> 29:30.069
Hey, Nick, I think I found
the window that was broken.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.773
I found a sliver of glass outside

29:31.836 --> 29:33.315
and the putty around
the window was new.

29:33.371 --> 29:34.543
You're inside the house?

29:34.606 --> 29:36.017
We got probable cause here.

29:36.074 --> 29:38.816
I'm going to see if I can get a sample
of that guy's DNA You still got him?

29:38.877 --> 29:41.585
Yeah, he's at the Blue Moon bar.

29:41.646 --> 29:43.523
You can see him? Yeah.

29:43.915 --> 29:45.053
Don't let him make you.

29:45.116 --> 29:46.459
No, I'm being careful.

29:46.518 --> 29:48.225
Call me if he starts back here.

29:49.988 --> 29:52.127
Human beings are malleable, right?

29:52.957 --> 29:57.064
I think everyone needs
emotional and physical rebirth.

29:57.428 --> 29:58.839
I totally agree.

29:58.897 --> 30:00.205
Right? Yeah.

30:00.265 --> 30:02.939
But you got to have some
place to do it. Uh-huh.

30:03.001 --> 30:05.880
Barkeep, double dead guy,
please. Thanks.

30:05.937 --> 30:09.441
A sanctuary, a place where
the world can't intrude,

30:10.575 --> 30:13.784
a retreat for people just like you.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.219
That sounds like
exactly what I need.

30:16.281 --> 30:17.282
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:17.348 --> 30:18.349
It's simple.

30:21.786 --> 30:23.493
What a great name "Bramble Haus."

30:23.555 --> 30:24.898
Thank you.

30:25.523 --> 30:26.797
Do you know the Bramble bushes,

30:26.858 --> 30:31.500
they extend these long arching
canes that at first don't flower,

30:32.130 --> 30:36.601
but then with a loving touch
produce a succulent fruit

30:36.668 --> 30:39.672
that is just bursting with flavor.

30:41.573 --> 30:42.574
Double dead.

30:43.775 --> 30:44.879
Wow.

30:53.785 --> 30:54.991
Anytime you want to come by,

30:55.053 --> 30:57.397
just call the number or stop on by.

33:13.257 --> 33:14.827
Oh, my God.

33:24.102 --> 33:25.274
What are you doing?

33:25.336 --> 33:26.644
No way.

33:27.305 --> 33:30.218
Dude, I can't be around that guy.
He's way too potent.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.154
I almost bought him a drink.

33:32.210 --> 33:34.121
No, I need you to go back inside.

33:34.178 --> 33:35.589
I need to know what
he's going to do.

33:35.646 --> 33:36.750
He's hitting on a girl.

33:36.814 --> 33:39.556
She's buying the full toad,
you know?

33:39.917 --> 33:41.555
He gave her his card.
What more do you need to know?

33:41.619 --> 33:43.030
What? What, now you're mad?

33:43.087 --> 33:44.327
He's coming out.

33:50.695 --> 33:52.231
You want me to track him?

33:52.296 --> 33:53.639
No. You're done.

33:53.698 --> 33:55.075
You did good. Thank you.

33:56.834 --> 33:58.074
You can go home now.

34:01.139 --> 34:03.050
I don't want to go home now.

34:17.355 --> 34:18.891
You know if you like gardens,
I happen to...

34:18.956 --> 34:20.458
Piss off. Okay.

34:21.692 --> 34:23.364
One more. Please.

34:31.469 --> 34:33.847
Hank, come on,
where the hell are you, man?

34:39.877 --> 34:41.788
Pick up the damn phone!
He's on his way home.

35:18.116 --> 35:19.288
Portland Police.

35:19.350 --> 35:20.727
Yeah, it's Detective Burkhardt.

35:20.785 --> 35:22.423
I need a 20 on Detective Griffin.

35:22.487 --> 35:23.864
Track his cell.

35:23.921 --> 35:24.956
Tracking now.

35:25.022 --> 35:26.194
Yeah, I'll stay on the line.

35:52.683 --> 35:53.718
Still tracking.

35:53.784 --> 35:55.388
All right, call me
back when you find him.

36:03.294 --> 36:04.637
That was fast.

36:04.695 --> 36:06.436
Why wait? I'm ready.

36:06.631 --> 36:08.838
Fantastic. I'll show you a room.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.038
I promise you won't regret it.

36:10.601 --> 36:12.274
I really want to see your garden.

36:13.337 --> 36:17.479
It's late. But I think I have one
more tour left in me. Come on.

36:23.414 --> 36:24.415
Remember me?

36:24.949 --> 36:26.587
Of course, yes.
You're the detective.

36:26.984 --> 36:28.224
What can I do for you?

36:28.352 --> 36:29.490
I need to talk to her.

36:29.554 --> 36:30.658
Me?

36:30.788 --> 36:32.529
Would you mind stepping outside?

36:32.590 --> 36:34.331
I just need to ask
you a few questions.

36:34.992 --> 36:37.029
Am I in trouble?
What's this all about?

36:37.094 --> 36:38.698
Just come outside, please.

36:39.630 --> 36:40.768
I'm sure it'll be fine.

36:40.898 --> 36:42.070
Why don't you go with him

36:42.133 --> 36:44.238
and I'll be here when you get back.

36:45.002 --> 36:46.481
Okay? Okay?

36:54.879 --> 36:56.586
I wish you'd just tell me
what this is all about.

36:56.647 --> 36:58.752
You walked into the middle
of a police investigation.

36:59.917 --> 37:02.864
I need you to leave
the premises. Now!

37:04.455 --> 37:05.525
Yeah?

37:05.590 --> 37:07.399
We've got a 20 on
Detective Griffin.

37:07.458 --> 37:09.631
We've identified the
location as the Bramble Haus,

37:09.694 --> 37:11.765
Bed and Breakfast on Longacre Road.

37:11.829 --> 37:12.864
Thanks.

37:46.697 --> 37:47.698
Hank?

37:51.335 --> 37:52.541
Hank!

38:05.449 --> 38:06.587
Where are you?

38:06.651 --> 38:07.755
Nick.

38:10.454 --> 38:11.558
What happened?

38:11.622 --> 38:14.398
I don't know, man.
It's some kind of gas.

38:14.458 --> 38:15.664
Look here.

38:18.829 --> 38:19.830
Are they real?

38:26.804 --> 38:28.477
He's got some kind of
gas coming in here.

38:28.873 --> 38:30.079
Got to get them out of here.

38:30.141 --> 38:31.745
Yeah, but we have to
shut that gas off first.

38:31.809 --> 38:33.186
We'll come back for them.

38:43.287 --> 38:44.288
Oh!

38:45.356 --> 38:46.596
I couldn't stay away.

38:47.191 --> 38:48.363
Lucky me.

38:48.426 --> 38:49.632
You leaving?

38:49.994 --> 38:51.234
Yes, it's such a lovely night.

38:51.295 --> 38:52.740
I thought that I
would take a drive.

38:52.797 --> 38:54.799
I was hoping I could stay.

38:54.865 --> 38:56.105
Well, why don't you come with me

38:56.167 --> 38:57.612
and we can talk about it, okay?

38:57.668 --> 38:59.204
Okay.

39:07.545 --> 39:08.546
Did you see that?

39:08.612 --> 39:10.785
What are you talking about?
Stand back.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.420
No, the gas is going to blow.

39:13.484 --> 39:15.327
We got to find something
to break this door open.

39:15.386 --> 39:17.127
No time. Just us.

39:18.989 --> 39:20.059
Let's do it.

39:20.124 --> 39:22.126
One, two, three!

39:24.462 --> 39:27.841
Again. One, two, three.

39:44.949 --> 39:47.452
You're going to be all
right now. It's over.

39:48.619 --> 39:51.828
House is clean, car is gone.
He's in the wind.

39:52.523 --> 39:54.025
God, I'd hate to lose
this son of a bitch.

39:54.091 --> 39:55.695
No more than I do.

40:10.574 --> 40:12.611
Let it be my birthday.

40:20.451 --> 40:22.397
You didn't get that
grease spot for nothing.

40:37.368 --> 40:38.745
Here you go.

40:39.804 --> 40:40.805
Thanks.

40:40.905 --> 40:42.578
We should really get going soon.

40:43.274 --> 40:45.117
I can't believe I'm doing this.

40:45.176 --> 40:47.588
I've never done anything
like this before.

40:47.778 --> 40:49.280
Am I crazy?

40:49.346 --> 40:51.155
Maybe I'm crazy to take you.

40:54.919 --> 40:56.364
Are we leaving now?

40:56.420 --> 40:57.524
Stop! Police!

40:57.588 --> 40:58.794
Billy!

40:59.356 --> 41:00.733
Police! Out of the way!

41:09.033 --> 41:11.070
Billy Capra, stay where you are!

41:23.781 --> 41:24.782
Get down!

41:55.713 --> 41:57.090
This is one sick dude.

41:57.147 --> 41:59.423
We sent his DNA to Tucson,
Des Moines and Detroit

41:59.483 --> 42:00.985
and I'm betting it's the same guy.

42:01.051 --> 42:02.086
Well, at least he's
off the streets,

42:02.152 --> 42:03.654
and out of the hotel business.

42:03.721 --> 42:06.258
I can't believe any of these
women want to be near this guy.

42:06.323 --> 42:08.860
You know what?
I'm betting it's the toads.

42:08.926 --> 42:10.735
Yeah, right, toads.

42:10.794 --> 42:12.774
If only it was that easy.

42:12.830 --> 42:14.776
Maybe I'll get me some toads.

42:20.004 --> 42:23.577
See how he likes being in a
cage for the rest of his life.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
