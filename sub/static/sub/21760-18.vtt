You guys!

01:25.620 --> 01:29.000
Cruella must have been
smoking in bed again.

01:29.000 --> 01:32.790
She has heavy
negative nicotine karma.

01:32.790 --> 01:36.290
Spot: Yeah, and every time
she torches her house,

01:36.290 --> 01:38.580
you know where she ends up.

01:38.580 --> 01:39.920
Horace: Here we are.

01:39.920 --> 01:41.250
How dare they tell me to quit?

01:41.250 --> 01:43.120
Smoking is me.

01:43.120 --> 01:46.290
It's part
of my glamorous image.

01:46.290 --> 01:47.330
Horace: Oh, yeah, mm-hmm.

01:50.540 --> 01:52.210
Cruella, what's wrong?

01:52.210 --> 01:55.120
My bedroom,
that's what's wrong.

01:55.120 --> 01:58.420
Burned to a crisp.

01:58.420 --> 02:01.620
So now it matches the kitchen,
den and garage?

02:01.620 --> 02:05.710
Very amusing, Ripley,
but that's the least
of my problems.

02:05.710 --> 02:09.290
My home insurance company
is being completely
unreasonable.

02:09.290 --> 02:12.620
They won't
let me move back in
unless I quit smoking!

02:12.620 --> 02:15.540
Well, you really should
quit, Cruella.

02:15.540 --> 02:17.830
If Roger and I can do
anything to help...

02:17.830 --> 02:20.750
How kind of you,
Anita, darling.

02:20.750 --> 02:23.540
Bring in all the bags,
Horace!

02:25.120 --> 02:27.120
It's just too, too sweet of you

02:27.120 --> 02:30.210
to offer your dreary
little shack as a halfway house.

02:30.210 --> 02:33.460
This time I'll stay just
a tad longer than usual,

02:33.460 --> 02:35.460
until I quit smoking.

02:37.580 --> 02:39.040
Aaaaah!

02:39.040 --> 02:40.920
Ohh!

02:40.920 --> 02:42.710
Cruella: Hmm, hmm, hmm.

02:42.710 --> 02:44.920
Now, wait just
a minute here!

02:44.920 --> 02:47.210
Roger, she's trying to quit.

02:47.210 --> 02:50.040
Remember how hard it was when
you quit smoking your pipe?

02:50.040 --> 02:52.670
Okay, on one
condition.

02:52.670 --> 02:54.210
This is a smoke-free house.

02:54.210 --> 02:56.420
Not one cigarette touches
your lips.

02:56.420 --> 02:59.790
You'll have to quit
like I did: cold turkey.

03:01.880 --> 03:04.250
Oh, all right.
How hard can it be?

03:04.250 --> 03:07.540
As of this moment,
I am a nonsmoker.

03:11.670 --> 03:14.210
Do you really think
she could quit?

03:14.210 --> 03:17.620
Cadpig: I give her
five seconds, tops.

03:17.620 --> 03:21.080
See? Quitting is easy.

03:26.420 --> 03:27.920
Oh!

03:29.000 --> 03:31.420
She's never gonna make it.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.620
Smoking is a dangerous,
unhealthy habit,

03:34.620 --> 03:35.920
very tough to quit.

03:35.920 --> 03:39.670
Why, Cruella
could be here forever!

03:39.670 --> 03:40.960
Forever?

03:40.960 --> 03:42.790
As in, forever?

03:42.790 --> 03:44.330
You know, perhaps we should be

03:44.330 --> 03:45.580
receptive to helping

03:45.580 --> 03:47.880
a fellow mammal in distress.

03:49.000 --> 03:51.330
Now, we're picking up Nanny
at the train station,

03:51.330 --> 03:52.830
so you're gonna be alone.

03:52.830 --> 03:54.290
You sure you'll be all right?

03:54.290 --> 03:57.170
Oh, don't be ridiculous,
darling.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.620
I'm a nonsmoker now.

03:59.620 --> 04:01.170
Ta-ta!

04:01.170 --> 04:04.580
I think I'll take a walk.

04:04.580 --> 04:07.290
Come on, guys,
she's gonna crack.

04:08.500 --> 04:11.120
Mmm! Fresh air!

04:11.120 --> 04:13.120
And now that I'm a nonsmoker,

04:13.120 --> 04:15.670
I can truly enjoy it...

04:17.000 --> 04:19.670
...with a cigarette!

04:19.670 --> 04:21.880
Lucky: Back, back...

04:21.880 --> 04:23.960
Left, and...

04:23.960 --> 04:25.750
-Fire!

04:32.710 --> 04:34.120
What?

04:34.120 --> 04:35.040
Aaaaah!

04:37.120 --> 04:40.000
Oh, this barnyard
is crawling with animals!

04:42.040 --> 04:43.210
Inside!

04:44.710 --> 04:47.290
Must... have...

04:47.290 --> 04:49.210
cigarette!

04:49.210 --> 04:51.960
Oh! Oh! Ohhh!

04:55.120 --> 04:56.290
Ahh!

05:04.380 --> 05:05.920
Grrr! Grrr!

05:05.920 --> 05:07.790
Grrrrr!

05:21.960 --> 05:24.620
Why, you miserable little...

05:24.620 --> 05:26.880
Aaaah!

05:28.250 --> 05:29.500
Ohhh!

05:31.880 --> 05:34.670
This isn't working.
We gotta cut her off
at the source.

05:34.670 --> 05:36.710
Spot,
get the bathroom door.

05:36.710 --> 05:37.750
Got it!

05:43.330 --> 05:47.000
You keep her in here, Spot.
We'll get rid of her stash.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.000
Oh, sure.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.880
Wow! Nothing but cigarettes.

05:58.080 --> 06:00.960
Maybe she thinks tobacco's
a food group.

06:01.880 --> 06:04.330
Well, let's get started.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.790
We'll flush them all
down the toilet.

06:06.790 --> 06:09.420
But Cruella's locked
in the downstairs bathroom.

06:09.420 --> 06:12.120
We'd have to take them
all the way upstairs.

06:12.120 --> 06:14.080
All of 'em?

06:14.080 --> 06:16.000
It'll be a piece of cake.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.880
We just need
some reinforcements.

06:24.080 --> 06:26.880
Hurry, before she comes to!

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Last one.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.790
Was this a brilliant plan
or what?

06:43.330 --> 06:44.540
Huh? Uh-oh.

06:44.540 --> 06:46.380
She's gonna blow!

06:47.960 --> 06:49.960
Help!

06:55.040 --> 06:57.290
No! Nooooo!

06:58.880 --> 06:59.920
Ptooey!

06:59.920 --> 07:02.670
Oh, all my cigarettes!

07:02.670 --> 07:04.790
Ruined!

07:10.960 --> 07:13.460
Oh, Worldwide
Wholesale Cigarettes?

07:13.460 --> 07:16.080
Urgent delivery, Dearly Farm!

07:20.380 --> 07:22.750
What took you so long?

07:24.330 --> 07:25.920
Blast!

07:25.920 --> 07:27.790
Well, how did it go,
Cruella?

07:27.790 --> 07:29.620
Fine, just fine.

07:29.620 --> 07:31.620
You really haven't
been smoking?

07:31.620 --> 07:32.830
Hmm-mm.

07:36.540 --> 07:37.710
Not a puff.

07:37.710 --> 07:40.290
Why, I haven't had
the slightest craving all day.

07:51.500 --> 07:52.920
Rolly:
We've failed.

07:52.920 --> 07:56.210
We are never
gonna make her
stop smoking.

07:56.210 --> 07:59.960
You can't make someone quit
if they don't want to.

07:59.960 --> 08:01.830
When Roger quit smoking
his pipe,

08:01.830 --> 08:04.330
he didn't really want to either.

08:04.330 --> 08:08.040
So he got one of those self-help
sleep teaching cassette tapes.

08:08.040 --> 08:09.330
What's that?

08:09.330 --> 08:12.750
A cassette tape that teaches
you stuff while you sleep.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.000
Maybe he still has it.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.120
Spot: Let's go!

08:20.250 --> 08:22.250
Here it is!

08:22.250 --> 08:24.580
"Stop Smoking Now."

08:45.750 --> 08:47.420
Ahh!

08:52.540 --> 08:53.540
Huh?

08:54.580 --> 08:55.790
Rolly: Oops!

08:55.790 --> 08:58.210
At least she's asleep.

08:59.210 --> 09:01.500
Man: Hello, little puppy.

09:01.500 --> 09:05.750
Tonight we'll learn why
newspaper is your friend!

09:15.620 --> 09:16.750
Hmm.

09:18.380 --> 09:21.000
Cruella? Breakfast...

09:21.000 --> 09:22.330
is served?

09:34.040 --> 09:36.830
She thinks
she's a dog!

09:40.210 --> 09:43.000
Rolly: This Cruella
is kind of fun!

09:43.000 --> 09:44.830
But, you know,
it's almost as if

09:44.830 --> 09:47.000
the other side
of the "stop smoking" tape

09:47.000 --> 09:48.620
was a dog training tape,

09:48.620 --> 09:52.330
and we accidentally
switched 'em.

09:52.330 --> 09:54.420
Naaah!

09:55.500 --> 09:57.420
puppies: Oh, no!

10:08.580 --> 10:09.750
Oww! Hey!

10:09.750 --> 10:12.460
Get this crazy lady off of me!

10:12.460 --> 10:14.620
Cruella! Cruella!

10:17.880 --> 10:20.920
Lovely stockings.
Argyle?

10:20.920 --> 10:22.790
Uh-huh...

10:26.210 --> 10:29.330
That's it.
I'll never smoke again, Anita.

10:29.330 --> 10:30.750
I've hit bottom.

10:30.750 --> 10:32.750
Once you've chewed
on a man's socks,

10:32.750 --> 10:36.540
the world is a whole
different... flavor.

10:36.540 --> 10:37.620
I'm going home.

10:37.620 --> 10:40.000
Here, try some
bubble gum.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.420
It will take
your mind off smoking.

10:42.420 --> 10:45.580
Bubble gum! Of course!
That's the answer.

10:45.580 --> 10:47.460
I must have more!

10:56.620 --> 10:59.750
Mm, bubble gum.

11:19.580 --> 11:22.830
Huh

11:27.620 --> 11:28.620
Out of my way, Runyan.

11:28.620 --> 11:32.540
I'm moving in until I can
quit chewing gum!

11:32.540 --> 11:33.670
Roger: Ohh!

11:48.620 --> 11:51.500
Now, don't you look
quite the elegant
little lady,

11:51.500 --> 11:54.250
all fresh from
the groomer's, hmm?

11:54.250 --> 11:56.710
Someone will suffer
for this.

12:00.920 --> 12:03.170
Oh, I'm running late,
late, late.

12:03.170 --> 12:06.000
I'll never have time
to fix dinner.

12:06.000 --> 12:08.830
It's takeout tonight,
I'm afraid.

12:18.540 --> 12:22.460
Oh, just look at that poor,
oppressed creature.

12:22.460 --> 12:25.500
He endures his captivity
with such calm.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.250
child: I want that one,
Daddy!

12:27.250 --> 12:29.500
Cadpig: No!

12:29.500 --> 12:32.000
They're gonna eat him?

12:55.960 --> 12:57.500
Saving a bottom feeder

12:57.500 --> 13:00.670
should at least get me
a humanitarian award.

13:00.670 --> 13:03.750
Spot: What do you mean
you liberated a lobster?

13:03.750 --> 13:05.830
I had no choice.

13:05.830 --> 13:08.960
He was headed for
the big butter bath
in the sky.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.380
But it's stealing.

13:10.380 --> 13:12.620
The lobster police
will get us for sure.

13:12.620 --> 13:14.040
Rolly: Spot's right.

13:14.040 --> 13:17.330
We better eat the evidence.
Anybody got a squeeze of lemon?

13:17.330 --> 13:20.170
Rolly, how could you?

13:20.170 --> 13:23.460
Nothing personal,
it's a food chain thing.

13:25.790 --> 13:28.040
Helping defenseless
animals can be cool,

13:28.040 --> 13:30.670
but we can't just
keep him in a jar.

13:30.670 --> 13:33.170
Hello? Maybe we should ask
the poor guy

13:33.170 --> 13:35.080
what he'd like to do.

13:37.460 --> 13:39.880
Oh, finally.

13:39.880 --> 13:42.170
Hello. My name's Lance, and...

13:42.170 --> 13:46.330
Wait! Let us remove
this old rubber band,

13:46.330 --> 13:50.170
the symbol of your oppression,
from your mighty claw.

13:51.210 --> 13:52.580
Uh, thank you, but--

13:52.580 --> 13:54.330
No need for thanks.

13:54.330 --> 13:56.750
You are a child
of the universe,

13:56.750 --> 13:59.710
no less than the trees
and the stars.

13:59.710 --> 14:02.000
You have a right
to express yourself.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.500
Then I must tell you...

14:03.500 --> 14:05.210
Put a lid on it!

14:05.210 --> 14:07.040
And now, we must return

14:07.040 --> 14:10.170
this noble creature
to the wild.

14:10.170 --> 14:11.790
Lucky:
Hey! I know.

14:11.790 --> 14:13.420
We could take him
to Hiccup Hole.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.460
I'm sure he'd be
welcome there.

14:18.250 --> 14:20.500
He is not welcome here.

14:20.500 --> 14:24.040
Lobsters shed their shells.
It's disgusting.

14:24.040 --> 14:27.250
I will not turn
my beautiful home

14:27.250 --> 14:30.500
into an exoskeletal
scrap heap.

14:30.500 --> 14:34.540
How can you harden your heart
to this majestic mollusk,

14:34.540 --> 14:36.670
this courtly crustacean?

14:36.670 --> 14:40.710
How can you be so selfish
to a shellfish?

14:42.120 --> 14:44.670
You need professional help.

14:47.080 --> 14:49.380
I got it!
We can take him
to the swamp.

14:49.380 --> 14:50.880
Of course!

14:50.880 --> 14:54.330
A stagnant, reeking
expanse of freedom.

14:54.330 --> 14:57.750
Lance, mumbling:
No...

15:01.500 --> 15:04.170
I still think we should
ask him.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.040
Rolly: I still think
we should eat him.

15:09.210 --> 15:12.290
Are we sure this
is a good lobster
neighborhood?

15:12.290 --> 15:14.250
I mean, what are
the schools like?

15:20.000 --> 15:22.330
Looks like Swamp Rat's not home.

15:22.330 --> 15:25.500
Yo, we could get back
in time for dinner if we...

15:25.500 --> 15:26.710
Aaaah!

15:28.380 --> 15:30.210
Excuse us,
Mr. Rat, sir.

15:30.210 --> 15:32.330
We were just...
leaving.

15:38.790 --> 15:42.580
Howdy, howdy, howdy, hi.
What can I do ya for?

15:42.580 --> 15:45.620
We were looking
for a good home for
an oppressed creature

15:45.620 --> 15:48.960
who isn't
living up to his full
lobster potential.

15:48.960 --> 15:52.830
Sorry, no room for deadbeats,
layabouts, charity cases, or...

15:52.830 --> 15:56.540
Did you say l

15:56.540 --> 15:59.620
That is to say, uh, lobster?

16:01.040 --> 16:04.330
Why, of course
we've got room
for a lobster.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.420
You do?

16:05.420 --> 16:08.250
Why, of course!
Heh-heh!

16:08.250 --> 16:10.080
I'll be happy
to help make your friend

16:10.080 --> 16:13.000
a useful, contributing member
of society.

16:13.000 --> 16:16.040
It's one of the hallmarks
of an enlightened free market.

16:16.040 --> 16:18.330
A thousand points of light
and all that.

16:18.330 --> 16:22.580
Don't worry, he's in good hands!

16:22.580 --> 16:26.750
Well, he was certainly
full of the milk
of rodent kindness.

16:26.750 --> 16:29.670
Yeah.
Almost too full of it.

16:29.670 --> 16:33.670
Did anybody besides me
think that was too easy?

16:33.670 --> 16:35.040
Maybe we'd better

16:35.040 --> 16:36.380
go back and check.

16:39.920 --> 16:41.420
Noooo!

16:43.420 --> 16:45.420
You said you were
gonna make him

16:45.420 --> 16:47.580
a contributing member
of society.

16:47.580 --> 16:50.290
He's contributing
to my gumbo recipe.

16:50.290 --> 16:51.420
Close enough.

16:51.420 --> 16:53.620
Owwww!

16:53.620 --> 16:56.290
I hope no kid ever
holds a lit match
like that.

16:56.290 --> 16:57.500
That can hurt.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.210
Rolly: You'll never get
away with this, Swamp Rat.

17:01.330 --> 17:03.880
Any decent gumbo
needs cayenne pepper.

17:03.880 --> 17:06.170
There's plenty
of cayenne, chubby boy.

17:06.170 --> 17:09.330
The secret is to start
with a wallop of kosher salt.

17:09.330 --> 17:12.000
Rolly: Salt? No, no, no!

17:12.000 --> 17:15.380
First, the cayenne pepper,
then the...

17:15.380 --> 17:16.250
all: Rolly!

17:16.250 --> 17:17.670
Yaah!

17:17.670 --> 17:19.790
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow!

17:21.880 --> 17:23.750
Ptooey! Ptooey!

17:23.750 --> 17:26.170
Sucker punch me, will ya?!

17:37.170 --> 17:38.830
Whew!

17:40.460 --> 17:42.170
Oh, sorry, guys.

17:42.170 --> 17:45.500
My stomach sort of
took over my brain.

17:45.500 --> 17:46.540
There's news.

17:46.540 --> 17:49.000
You know, it just
occurred to me,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.250
Lance is
a saltwater
creature.

17:51.250 --> 17:53.250
He couldn't
have lived in
the swamp, anyway,

17:53.250 --> 17:55.080
or Hiccup Hole.

17:55.080 --> 17:57.880
Spot, you're right!

17:57.880 --> 18:02.250
Hear that, little friend?
We've been thinking too small.

18:02.250 --> 18:05.290
We shall return you
to the briny deep.

18:09.120 --> 18:11.120
Please, please, wait, I --

18:11.120 --> 18:13.250
Cadpig:
May this gentle river

18:13.250 --> 18:16.620
carry you softly
to your ocean home.

18:16.620 --> 18:18.330
Chuck him!

18:20.710 --> 18:24.540
On my ship, we serve only
the freshest seafood.

18:27.290 --> 18:30.710
Ugh! It's so fresh,
it fights back.

18:30.710 --> 18:31.920
Ha ha ha!

18:31.920 --> 18:34.750
Don't you just love
an entree with spunk?

18:34.750 --> 18:35.750
Ugggh!

18:38.120 --> 18:40.080
He's back.

18:40.080 --> 18:43.620
Ah...

18:43.620 --> 18:45.710
This will work for sure!

18:45.710 --> 18:48.830
Actually, it's your most
harebrained scheme yet.

18:48.830 --> 18:51.250
You could be a little
more positive.

18:51.250 --> 18:53.420
Must you always see
the toilet bowl

18:53.420 --> 18:55.120
as half empty?

18:55.120 --> 18:57.250
You know,
this might just work.

18:57.250 --> 18:59.120
Of course it'll work.

18:59.120 --> 19:01.250
The waters of life
are all connected

19:01.250 --> 19:03.170
and those
of your toilet bowl

19:03.170 --> 19:07.330
run to the sea
in a giant flush
of freedom.

19:09.290 --> 19:13.250
Rolly, trip the lever
of liberty!

19:14.460 --> 19:15.830
Lance: Wait, please!

19:15.830 --> 19:18.120
There's something I really
have to tell you.

19:18.120 --> 19:20.670
It will have to wait
for the next life.

19:20.670 --> 19:23.380
Farewell, gentle lobster!

19:23.380 --> 19:26.830
Rolly: Half of a perfectly
delicious surf-and-turf,

19:26.830 --> 19:28.540
down the drain.

19:28.540 --> 19:32.210
Ah. I wonder what he
was trying to say.

19:32.210 --> 19:35.500
Probably just wanted to thank me
for liberating him.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.250
Yowwww!

19:48.000 --> 19:49.250
Aaah!

19:52.960 --> 19:54.750
There's nothing like the joy

19:54.750 --> 19:58.170
of a noble mission
nobly completed.

19:58.170 --> 19:59.710
Yeah.

19:59.710 --> 20:02.080
But I'm still
craving seafood.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.170
Woman:
This breaking story just in.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.710
Lobster-napping
in downtown Grutley,

20:06.710 --> 20:08.540
that's the charge
of Cap'n Buddy

20:08.540 --> 20:10.170
of Cap'n Buddy's
Seafood Restaurant,

20:10.170 --> 20:12.170
open weekdays
10:00 to 9:00,
closed Sundays.

20:12.170 --> 20:15.040
Cap'n Buddy's
pet lobster
was stolen

20:15.040 --> 20:16.040
from its tank today.

20:16.040 --> 20:20.460
Uh... p

20:20.460 --> 20:24.170
So, Cap'n,
this lobster was
not for eating?

20:24.170 --> 20:25.750
Eating?!

20:25.750 --> 20:28.080
Why Lance is like
a son to me!

20:28.080 --> 20:29.580
He was...

20:29.580 --> 20:32.120
Cap'n Buddy's...

20:32.120 --> 20:33.920
little buddy.

20:33.920 --> 20:37.380
Well, now we know
what Lance was
trying to tell us.

20:37.380 --> 20:42.120
Is it possible that I was
an unclear communicator,

20:42.120 --> 20:44.540
demonstrated poor
listening skills,

20:44.540 --> 20:48.330
was too caught up
in my own mission to
assess Lance's needs?

20:48.330 --> 20:49.880
others: Uh-huh.

20:49.880 --> 20:52.120
And don't forget
to add one count

20:52.120 --> 20:54.170
of grand theft
lobster.

20:54.170 --> 20:57.580
Hey, you were just trying
to help a fellow creature.

20:57.580 --> 21:00.000
We know your heart
was in the right place.

21:01.500 --> 21:03.460
The least I can do

21:03.460 --> 21:05.040
is return Lance's band

21:05.040 --> 21:06.540
to Cap'n Buddy,

21:06.540 --> 21:09.120
as a memento
of his old friend.

21:12.460 --> 21:16.170
Getting my catch
of the day used
to be joyous.

21:16.170 --> 21:18.120
But now...

21:29.750 --> 21:31.040
Lance:
Get me outta here!

21:31.040 --> 21:32.330
No!

21:32.330 --> 21:34.620
Could it be?

21:34.620 --> 21:36.250
Lance!

21:36.250 --> 21:38.460
Little buddy!

21:42.290 --> 21:45.710
Perhaps returning
this rubber band to Cap'n Buddy

21:45.710 --> 21:48.710
will express
my everlasting remorse.

21:48.710 --> 21:49.880
Huh?

21:51.420 --> 21:52.920
Lance?

21:56.460 --> 21:57.920
Lance!

22:01.290 --> 22:05.000
Cap'n Buddy: Please, step away
from the lobster!
