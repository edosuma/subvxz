01:29.933 --> 01:32.493
Was her only line, "I am your wife?"

01:32.704 --> 01:34.838
It was kind of her catchphrase.

01:34.871 --> 01:36.840
Look, "Puso Sa Puso"
might not have passed

01:36.874 --> 01:38.576
the Bechdel Test or anything,

01:38.609 --> 01:40.727
but I'm telling you...
It was a big, fat hit.

01:40.829 --> 01:43.977
- I loved it.
- I didn't.

01:44.111 --> 01:46.514
That was physically painful to watch.

01:46.546 --> 01:49.582
Like my body was rejecting
it while watching it.

01:49.615 --> 01:50.950
Okay, don't listen to him. He just...

01:50.984 --> 01:53.020
I want a physical copy so I can burn it.

01:53.052 --> 01:54.654
He's too young to realize

01:54.687 --> 01:58.058
how brilliant your impersonation
of Bruce Boxleitner was.

01:58.091 --> 02:00.026
You're thinking of
"Scarecrow and Mrs. King."

02:00.059 --> 02:01.962
I meant, um, no,

02:01.995 --> 02:04.064
your impersonation of Pierce Brosnan.

02:04.097 --> 02:06.499
I was "Remington Steele."
I was Robert Wagner.

02:06.532 --> 02:08.368
But look, I don't want to
dwell on the over-abundance

02:08.401 --> 02:10.402
of '80s romantic crime procedurals.

02:10.436 --> 02:11.805
I just wanted you guys to see that

02:11.838 --> 02:13.573
I was actually famous
for something besides

02:13.606 --> 02:15.775
- having a legendary meltdown.
- Mm!

02:15.808 --> 02:18.545
The second meltdown video
is trending on Twitter again.

02:18.579 --> 02:19.747
What? That was two days ago.

02:19.779 --> 02:21.715
Who's still watching that stupid thing?

02:21.749 --> 02:23.017
Well, I mean, it got a big boost

02:23.049 --> 02:25.051
when it circulated through
local and national news.

02:25.085 --> 02:26.120
How is Jim Brockmire

02:26.153 --> 02:29.656
yelling at a minor-league
ball game national news?

02:29.690 --> 02:31.758
The news now is pretty much anything

02:31.792 --> 02:34.128
that was on the Internet yesterday.

02:35.796 --> 02:37.665
This is your baptism, people!

02:37.697 --> 02:40.433
Bathe in the blood of the
people who have wronged you!

02:40.466 --> 02:41.835
And come out cleansed on the other side.

02:43.404 --> 02:44.739
It's not a big deal.

02:44.772 --> 02:47.007
So a couple of people
saw your new video.

02:47.040 --> 02:49.643
2,800,014.

02:49.675 --> 02:51.578
Holy shit!

02:51.612 --> 02:52.579
And 90.

02:52.613 --> 02:53.781
You just said 14.

02:53.814 --> 02:55.115
I'm sorry. I'm refreshing it.

02:55.149 --> 02:56.917
It's addictive.

02:56.950 --> 03:00.120
2,800,206!

03:00.154 --> 03:01.856
10!

03:01.888 --> 03:04.058
Charles, I like you, but
if you keep saying numbers,

03:04.090 --> 03:06.726
I'm gonna take this game
bat that George Brett signed,

03:06.760 --> 03:08.429
"To Jim, you are where it's bat,"

03:08.462 --> 03:10.530
and I'm gonna tunnel it straight up...

03:10.564 --> 03:12.066
All right. You're overreacting!

03:12.099 --> 03:13.601
Oh, no, hey. No, I'm not.

03:13.633 --> 03:14.734
You do not know what it's like

03:14.768 --> 03:17.437
to see the same exact look
in every stranger's eye...

03:17.470 --> 03:19.539
the look that says, "I
already know who you are,

03:19.572 --> 03:21.575
and I just can't wait for
you to lose your shit again."

03:21.607 --> 03:23.410
This isn't like last time, Jim!

03:23.444 --> 03:24.445
I know.

03:24.478 --> 03:26.513
Last time, I could lock
myself in a motel room

03:26.547 --> 03:28.549
and eat quaaludes
until I hit rock bottom.

03:28.582 --> 03:30.584
But now... This is rock
bottom. There it is.

03:30.617 --> 03:32.919
And there's not a 'lude in sight, so...

03:32.952 --> 03:34.687
Now where am I supposed to go?

03:34.720 --> 03:36.756
Last time, you were a
national personality.

03:36.790 --> 03:38.626
This time, no one even
knows where to find you!

03:39.793 --> 03:41.661
We have to make sure everybody
knows where to find him.

03:41.695 --> 03:44.732
I can tag the location of
the stadium in the video.

03:44.764 --> 03:45.933
Ooh! And the home schedule.

03:45.965 --> 03:48.101
And if you mention the video,
you get two-for-one tickets.

03:48.135 --> 03:49.570
Wait, wait.

03:49.602 --> 03:52.105
Don't you feel bad about
using Jim like this?

03:52.138 --> 03:54.541
Aren't you guys in a
serious relationship?

03:54.575 --> 03:55.843
I can't let my relationship with him

03:55.875 --> 03:57.304
interfere with this plan!

03:57.382 --> 03:59.946
Gary and Pennsylvania Shale
are torpedoing attendance.

03:59.980 --> 04:01.649
I need this!

04:01.681 --> 04:03.184
And he's tougher than he looks.

04:03.216 --> 04:06.085
He cries every day.

04:06.119 --> 04:08.088
Only when he's blacked-out drunk.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.090
And besides, he's happiest
when he's in the public eye.

04:13.192 --> 04:14.794
- There he is!
- No, no, no. Please, no.

04:14.827 --> 04:15.862
- I don't do that.
- Sir! Please!

04:18.065 --> 04:20.935
Hey, crazy mother

04:20.968 --> 04:22.903
Do something crazy, mother.

04:22.935 --> 04:24.037
I'll be right back, okay?

04:24.071 --> 04:25.038
Excuse me, folks!

04:25.071 --> 04:26.706
- This mother.
- Hey!

04:26.739 --> 04:28.843
Okay, come on, people.

04:28.875 --> 04:30.176
Please! All right, okay.

04:30.209 --> 04:31.845
Everybody just relax!

04:31.879 --> 04:33.847
Hey! Hey!

04:33.881 --> 04:36.583
You want to see me lose my
shit? Is that what you want?

04:36.617 --> 04:38.886
That's what gets you
hard, you... piece of shit?

04:44.191 --> 04:45.792
Oh, God.

04:45.826 --> 04:46.994
Man... All right.

04:47.027 --> 04:49.063
Sorry. I'm... Excuse me, everyone. Hi.

04:51.665 --> 04:52.833
That's what gets you
hard, you... piece of shit?

04:52.866 --> 04:54.768
That's what gets you
hard, you... piece of shit?

04:54.802 --> 04:55.930
That's what gets you
hard, you... piece of shit?

04:55.936 --> 04:56.842
The hell is wrong with these assholes?

04:56.869 --> 04:57.937
- I'm getting mobbed down there.
- Hey, hey.

04:57.970 --> 04:59.739
They are not assholes.

04:59.773 --> 05:02.042
They just want a little bit of
heat from your Internet fame,

05:02.074 --> 05:03.510
like that you kid you just
screamed at downstairs.

05:03.544 --> 05:05.079
It just happened. How
do you know about that?

05:05.112 --> 05:07.648
Because that's Pussyhound14!

05:07.681 --> 05:09.016
He has 4 million followers on Vine.

05:09.049 --> 05:11.619
He uploaded the video of you just now.

05:11.652 --> 05:12.081
80,000 loops already.

05:12.087 --> 05:13.192
That's what gets you
hard, you... piece of shit?

05:13.220 --> 05:14.955
That's what gets you
hard, you... piece of shit?

05:14.987 --> 05:16.089
That's what gets you
hard, you... piece of shit?

05:16.122 --> 05:17.790
Oh, God. Yeah, I hate everybody.

05:17.823 --> 05:18.691
Hey, look.

05:18.725 --> 05:19.893
Screaming about a
10-year-old's dick...

05:19.927 --> 05:21.095
that is really on brand.

05:21.128 --> 05:22.863
I just want to applaud you for that.

05:22.895 --> 05:24.806
That's what gets you
hard, you... piece of shit?

05:26.901 --> 05:28.636
Swing and a miss. Strike 2.

05:28.670 --> 05:30.905
That makes the count 2 and 2.

05:30.939 --> 05:32.074
You may have noticed

05:32.107 --> 05:34.710
that Pedro Uribe is
using a very unique bat.

05:34.742 --> 05:37.278
Most bats are made of maple or ash,

05:37.312 --> 05:40.282
but Uribe is holding a
piece of birch in his hand.

05:40.314 --> 05:43.584
Birch combines the strength of mahogany

05:43.617 --> 05:46.021
with some of the
natural give of a willow

05:46.054 --> 05:48.119
or, well, even a palm.

05:49.300 --> 05:50.469
Hey.

05:50.721 --> 05:52.056
Are you being intentionally boring

05:52.360 --> 05:54.028
so you don't end up in another video?

05:54.062 --> 05:55.196
No, no, no, no, no. I'm ju...

05:55.230 --> 05:58.435
I'm educating these fans on
the different types of wood.

05:58.536 --> 06:01.569
That better be vodka.
That's not water, is it?

06:01.602 --> 06:05.206
Hey. I don't need alcohol
to make it through the day.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.042
Oh, that is awful.

06:08.076 --> 06:10.879
Oh, my God!

06:10.912 --> 06:13.849
70% of the earth is
made up of that shit?

06:13.881 --> 06:16.117
Ugh! How do the fish do it?

06:19.353 --> 06:20.821
Something interesting.

06:20.855 --> 06:22.290
Cedar is an interesting wood.

06:22.324 --> 06:25.593
It naturally grabs odor.

06:28.263 --> 06:31.033
That was boring as shit, Brockmire.

06:31.066 --> 06:32.701
They won the game 14 to 6.

06:32.734 --> 06:34.169
Whatever. Eat a dick.

06:36.838 --> 06:38.040
He's not wrong.

06:38.073 --> 06:39.942
Look, I know I let you down today,

06:39.975 --> 06:40.876
but I have to let

06:40.910 --> 06:43.045
some of this attention
die down, all right?

06:43.078 --> 06:44.880
You don't know what it's
like to have the whole world

06:44.913 --> 06:46.581
know you for your worst qualities.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.115
Better than being anonymous.

06:48.148 --> 06:50.285
Since the divorce, my kids
won't ever call me back...

06:50.317 --> 06:51.285
Oh, Jesus Christ, Johnny the Hat.

06:51.319 --> 06:53.321
I'm trying to have a
conversation over here.

06:53.355 --> 06:55.157
Since the kids won't
call me... My son...

06:55.189 --> 06:58.759
He doesn't know... He
doesn't... I'm his dad.

07:02.364 --> 07:04.633
What do you really want?

07:04.665 --> 07:07.035
What gets you out of bed in the morning?

07:07.067 --> 07:09.036
Uh, the urge to pee, usually.

07:09.069 --> 07:10.939
Bullshit.

07:10.972 --> 07:13.875
Deep down, you want to call
games in the majors again.

07:13.908 --> 07:15.910
That's what you want.
You came to America

07:15.944 --> 07:18.146
to crawl your way back up to the top.

07:18.179 --> 07:19.047
Look, even if that were true,

07:19.079 --> 07:21.849
this kind of publicity is not helping.

07:21.883 --> 07:23.084
Are you kidding?

07:23.124 --> 07:25.093
This publicity is the
only thing that can help!

07:25.134 --> 07:26.803
Well, maybe I don't
want it that way, huh?

07:26.936 --> 07:29.190
Well, tell me another way!

07:29.223 --> 07:32.793
I mean... nobody cares

07:32.826 --> 07:35.230
that you're good at
calling baseball games.

07:35.263 --> 07:36.231
What they care about is that

07:36.263 --> 07:40.134
you're a charismatic open wound!

07:40.167 --> 07:42.136
The spotlight found you again.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.338
If you step into it,

07:43.371 --> 07:46.141
you can take it anywhere you want.

07:48.076 --> 07:50.879
Well, I'm gonna have to think on this.

07:50.912 --> 07:54.016
Jim Brockmire was stuck.

07:54.049 --> 07:57.251
Ironically, the very
instrument of his destruction...

07:57.285 --> 08:00.388
the Internet... could
also be his salvation.

08:00.422 --> 08:01.457
But was that ironic?

08:01.489 --> 08:04.893
Brockmire wasn't always
sure about the definition,

08:04.925 --> 08:07.128
and that Alanis Morissette was no help.

08:07.162 --> 08:10.198
"10,000 spoons when all you need
a knife" would only be ironic

08:10.230 --> 08:13.802
if she was trapped inside
some kind of a knife factory.

08:13.835 --> 08:15.303
Does he know that he's talking out loud?

08:15.336 --> 08:17.338
It's like his way of processing things.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.973
It'll be over soon.

08:19.006 --> 08:21.876
Truth was, he was
tired of his own scent.

08:23.143 --> 08:25.846
"Desperation by Jim Brockmire."

08:25.879 --> 08:27.081
And if internet fame

08:27.114 --> 08:29.951
was, in fact, his golden ticket
back to the Major Leagues,

08:29.984 --> 08:33.155
well, he would suck Willy Wonka's dick

08:33.187 --> 08:35.155
just to get his hands on it.

08:35.188 --> 08:37.291
Johnny always wore his hat

08:37.323 --> 08:41.515
because it was the last
thing his kids got for him.

08:41.586 --> 08:43.698
Johnny always wore his hat

08:43.732 --> 08:45.100
'cause his kids got it for him

08:45.133 --> 08:47.936
on the last Father's
Day he ever saw them.

08:47.968 --> 08:49.203
It was used.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.772
Probably left in the couch cushions

08:50.804 --> 08:53.207
by one of his wife's sex boyfriends.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.242
Hey, Johnny the Hat, please.

08:55.276 --> 08:57.813
Giving introspective monologues
in the third person...

08:57.845 --> 08:58.913
that's my thing.

08:58.946 --> 09:00.381
Sitting sadly alone over there...

09:00.414 --> 09:01.816
that's yours.

09:01.850 --> 09:03.451
I don't like my thing.

09:03.485 --> 09:06.818
I would like a new thing.

09:06.888 --> 09:10.324
That ball cannot be
buried in a Jewish cemetery

09:10.358 --> 09:13.846
because it just got tattooed!

09:13.908 --> 09:15.029
I don't see why that's funny,

09:15.062 --> 09:17.398
but how many hit...
hits? does that have?

09:17.432 --> 09:18.966
Uh, 200,000.

09:18.999 --> 09:21.403
200... And that's cat-me. I'm real me.

09:21.436 --> 09:23.405
I ought to be calling
games again in no time!

09:23.437 --> 09:25.439
Yeah.

09:25.472 --> 09:27.341
What, why are you making that face?

09:27.374 --> 09:28.342
Huh?

09:28.375 --> 09:30.172
Oh, this is just...
This is my normal face.

09:30.257 --> 09:32.134
No, that's your worried
face. That's the face you make

09:32.140 --> 09:34.215
when I peel the labels
off my pill bottles

09:34.249 --> 09:35.841
and play "Chemical
Roulette" with myself.

09:35.896 --> 09:37.985
Uh, we're reaching the end
of our Internet-fame cycle,

09:38.018 --> 09:40.522
and these things move very fast.

09:40.555 --> 09:43.024
It starts with videos, then
memes, conventional media,

09:43.057 --> 09:45.202
late-night monologues,
and then finally,

09:45.272 --> 09:48.062
if my mom's seen it, we're dead.

09:48.095 --> 09:49.971
Well, how long does all that take?

09:49.977 --> 09:51.518
Five days, a week tops.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.036
And my mom just sent me the link.

09:55.068 --> 09:56.270
- We need to hurry.
- Well, hey.

09:56.303 --> 09:58.973
Put me in, Coach. I
mean, uh, what's the plan?

09:59.007 --> 10:01.276
Okay, um, if we're going to

10:01.308 --> 10:02.910
immediately capitalize on your fame,

10:02.943 --> 10:05.012
then we need to take a shotgun approach.

10:05.046 --> 10:07.918
Just insert you into a bunch
of popular video formats

10:07.997 --> 10:09.733
like acoustic versions of songs,

10:09.766 --> 10:12.736
charity dares, playful
dogs with Down Syndrome.

10:12.768 --> 10:15.104
But if none of those
hit, then I'm afraid

10:15.137 --> 10:17.040
we're gonna have to start moving our way

10:17.073 --> 10:18.808
into creepy YouTube.

10:18.840 --> 10:22.244
Like ASMR.

10:22.277 --> 10:24.213
What is ASM...

10:24.247 --> 10:25.147
All right.

10:25.181 --> 10:28.183
Now, I'm gonna be
whispering about haircuts

10:28.217 --> 10:30.153
and maybe some bobcats.

10:30.185 --> 10:34.290
And then I'm gonna run my
hands across these beads.

10:34.324 --> 10:37.294
I'll be doing that for
about an hour and a half.

10:37.327 --> 10:38.695
Okay.

10:38.728 --> 10:40.030
So all of our other videos failed,

10:40.063 --> 10:43.133
but at least this one's
doing... fairly well.

10:43.165 --> 10:45.135
Somebody just commented that it

10:45.167 --> 10:48.704
feels like Brockmire just
gave his brain a handjob.

10:48.737 --> 10:52.776
Mleh. Speh.

10:52.809 --> 10:54.310
I'm calling it. We are done here.

10:54.343 --> 10:56.212
Just...

10:56.244 --> 10:57.212
I got you an interview.

10:57.246 --> 10:59.281
I got you an interview
on network television.

10:59.314 --> 11:01.284
Oh, my God. That's incredible!

11:01.316 --> 11:02.585
I mean, I wish you would have told me

11:02.618 --> 11:03.886
before I seduced a curtain,

11:03.920 --> 11:06.656
but... hey, why didn't
you think of that, huh?

11:06.689 --> 11:07.457
I don't know.

11:07.489 --> 11:09.191
No one my age watches network TV.

11:09.224 --> 11:10.292
They're gonna fly you to New York,

11:10.325 --> 11:12.661
and you'll be able to tell
your side of the story.

11:12.694 --> 11:14.897
Oh, my God. I have been waiting 10 years

11:14.930 --> 11:16.098
to tell my side of the story.

11:16.132 --> 11:17.666
I feel just like O.J.

11:17.699 --> 11:18.533
I know it.

11:18.568 --> 11:20.236
This is gonna be just the thing I need

11:20.268 --> 11:22.171
to get myself back into baseball.

11:22.204 --> 11:24.007
Yeah, yeah. This might work.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.843
Because nobody my age
watches baseball, either.

11:26.876 --> 11:27.877
Shut up.

11:32.972 --> 11:33.872
I mean, seriously,

11:33.906 --> 11:37.142
it's like the wardrobe
of a Filipino gigolo.

11:37.175 --> 11:39.078
You say that like it's a bad thing.

11:39.111 --> 11:40.775
Hey. Wh... uh, aren't
you gonna pack my jacket?

11:40.854 --> 11:44.093
Am I gonna pack your
jacket? Are you crazy?

11:45.125 --> 11:46.994
It's iconic.

11:47.027 --> 11:49.663
It's also how I smuggle
drugs onto airplanes.

11:49.696 --> 11:50.798
- What?!
- Oh, yeah.

11:50.831 --> 11:51.932
What do you mean?

11:51.966 --> 11:55.002
I got a little secret
compartment right by the armpit.

11:55.036 --> 11:56.071
What?

11:56.104 --> 12:00.075
And 20 years of B.O. masks
the scent from the dogs.

12:00.108 --> 12:02.010
- No!
- Oh, yeah.

12:04.912 --> 12:06.947
You know, I'm a little nervous.

12:06.980 --> 12:09.016
Last time I went on
national TV, it, uh...

12:09.050 --> 12:10.886
it did not go well.

12:12.454 --> 12:14.523
I'm serious.

12:14.556 --> 12:15.690
This might be my last chance.

12:15.723 --> 12:17.125
Really. What if I...

12:17.157 --> 12:19.527
I screw it all up?

12:19.561 --> 12:21.763
Baby, you won't.

12:21.796 --> 12:24.532
Just remember... never
answer the question they ask.

12:24.566 --> 12:26.634
Answer the question
you wish they had asked.

12:26.667 --> 12:30.672
And at some point, stare
off in the distance,

12:30.705 --> 12:32.073
make your lip quiver a little bit,

12:32.105 --> 12:34.075
and seem like you're gonna break down,

12:34.108 --> 12:35.577
and then smile through it.

12:35.609 --> 12:37.845
'Cause they... they
just eat that shit up.

12:37.878 --> 12:38.846
Okay?

12:38.879 --> 12:40.415
All right.

12:42.050 --> 12:44.585
Hey, this things looks cleaner to me.

12:44.619 --> 12:45.586
Oh, yeah.

12:45.619 --> 12:50.090
I was able to get most
of the obvious stains out.

12:50.124 --> 12:52.527
Well, aren't you the sweetest thing?

12:54.528 --> 12:55.830
You want a hit?

12:55.864 --> 12:57.132
Of your B.O. joint?

12:57.165 --> 12:58.900
Sure, I'll take a little.

12:58.932 --> 13:00.101
Thought you might.

13:07.214 --> 13:09.150
You are as advertised.

13:09.510 --> 13:11.812
Well, very important
to stay hydrated, Bill.

13:11.845 --> 13:12.947
Darling?

13:12.980 --> 13:14.883
I look all right?

13:14.916 --> 13:17.486
- Tie straight,
hair good? - Mm-hmm.

13:17.525 --> 13:19.962
All right. Let's roll.

13:19.988 --> 13:21.656
So,

13:21.688 --> 13:23.757
Jim Brockmire, how are you?

13:23.791 --> 13:24.792
Well, still dreaming about

13:24.826 --> 13:25.960
getting back to the Major Leagues.

13:25.994 --> 13:27.896
That's how I am, Bill Douglas.

13:27.928 --> 13:30.965
- Uh, how are you?
- I'm... I'm fine, thanks.

13:30.999 --> 13:34.268
Seriously, though, Bill. I do miss it.

13:35.170 --> 13:36.972
I miss having the best seat in the house

13:37.004 --> 13:38.706
for the best game in the world

13:38.739 --> 13:41.243
and making every single
moment come alive for people.

13:41.276 --> 13:45.847
Just, uh... O-On a good day...

13:50.889 --> 13:53.220
...it feels like...
you're a slice of apple

13:53.253 --> 13:56.090
in America's favorite
kind of pie, or something.

13:57.191 --> 13:59.160
What a great way to put that.

14:06.301 --> 14:08.036
Hey! Everybody shut up!

14:08.069 --> 14:09.170
Jim's coming on in a few minutes.

14:09.204 --> 14:11.973
He might mention us on TV
and give our lives meaning.

14:12.005 --> 14:12.806
Hoo.

14:12.840 --> 14:14.042
You know, this whole experience

14:14.075 --> 14:15.576
had made me realize something.

14:15.609 --> 14:17.912
There are only three kinds
of people in America...

14:17.946 --> 14:20.614
rich people, poor
people, and famous people.

14:20.648 --> 14:22.316
Rich people are just
poor people with money.

14:22.350 --> 14:25.236
No, the only truly worthwhile
thing is being famous.

14:25.275 --> 14:27.121
And after this little interview airs,

14:27.154 --> 14:30.157
this famous guy is gonna
be well on his way back

14:30.191 --> 14:33.228
to calling Major League
baseball games again.

14:35.296 --> 14:37.132
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.101
Shh!

14:40.133 --> 14:41.936
Good evening. I'm Bill Douglas.

14:41.970 --> 14:43.898
Tonight's surprisingly candid

14:43.937 --> 14:47.841
and heartfelt interview
with Jim Brockmire...

14:47.874 --> 14:49.210
will not be seen, as
we have breaking news.

14:49.243 --> 14:51.646
- What?!
- No, no, no!

14:51.678 --> 14:53.113
What are you talking about?!

14:53.147 --> 14:55.951
- Oh, you cock-swallowing
turds! - Shh.

14:55.984 --> 14:59.888
A Taylor Swift-Drake sex
tape has leaked online.

15:00.989 --> 15:03.124
Some people had sex. So what?

15:03.157 --> 15:05.326
TMZ already has an
estimate of his dick size!

15:05.359 --> 15:07.662
I'm so sorry.

15:07.695 --> 15:09.664
We are devoting our entire show...

15:09.696 --> 15:10.172
Ha!

15:10.178 --> 15:11.605
...to this disgusting
invasion of privacy.

15:11.633 --> 15:13.734
Swallow a turd!

15:17.331 --> 15:19.600
Why did they cancel "Puso to P-Puso?"

15:19.633 --> 15:21.402
"Puso Sa Puso."

15:21.434 --> 15:23.270
Something about copyright infringement.

15:23.303 --> 15:24.171
I don't know.

15:24.203 --> 15:27.373
Robert Wagner... he's
got eyes everywhere.

15:27.406 --> 15:29.442
Anyway, I'm gonna die...

15:29.476 --> 15:32.446
alone and penniless
and in this piss puddle.

15:32.478 --> 15:35.381
- Hey! You're not alone!
- I'm sorry.

15:35.414 --> 15:37.952
Just... Just penniless
and in this piss puddle.

15:37.985 --> 15:39.620
That's the spirit.

15:39.653 --> 15:41.956
I have not been this disappointed

15:41.989 --> 15:44.291
since I owned a
racehorse with Al Michaels

15:44.323 --> 15:46.794
and O.J. Simpson called Nags to Riches.

15:46.827 --> 15:48.995
It's 5:00 A.M. Let's go.

15:49.029 --> 15:51.832
No, I want...

15:51.865 --> 15:53.667
I want to hear the rest of the story.

15:53.699 --> 15:55.368
Sorry, kid.

15:55.401 --> 15:57.737
Everybody always wants to
hear the end of the story.

15:57.770 --> 15:59.539
That's the one gift that God gave me

15:59.572 --> 16:01.909
that he did not wrap in shit.

16:01.942 --> 16:04.245
Let's get out of here.

16:04.278 --> 16:07.882
Too bad you can't get famous
jut for telling stories, huh?

16:09.283 --> 16:11.685
Wait! Hey! Wait!

16:11.717 --> 16:14.387
That's it! That's it!

16:14.420 --> 16:17.624
Listen. We need something...

16:17.658 --> 16:19.726
that will play to your strengths

16:19.760 --> 16:22.295
of loving the sound of your own voice

16:22.328 --> 16:24.998
and talking forever.

16:26.533 --> 16:29.403
Podcasts.

16:30.569 --> 16:34.274
It's like radio, but
it's not on the radio.

16:37.034 --> 16:37.867
I mean, if you'd asked me

16:37.901 --> 16:39.836
who's more likely to commit murder,

16:39.870 --> 16:42.206
I would have said Al
Michaels, not O.J. Simpson.

16:43.307 --> 16:46.577
One time at the track, I
saw Al Michaels slap a dwarf

16:46.610 --> 16:48.697
because he did not like
the look on his face.

16:48.736 --> 16:51.181
I said, "Al, that's
just the man's face."

16:52.388 --> 16:54.318
I don't know, there's a
lesson in there somewhere,

16:54.351 --> 16:55.374
but I'll be darned if I know what it is.

16:55.420 --> 16:57.454
Anywhoodles, I have been Jim Brockmire,

16:57.486 --> 17:00.156
and this has been my first podcast.

17:00.189 --> 17:01.825
I... Are you kidding?

17:01.859 --> 17:03.695
I... Uh, pl... Before we leave you,

17:03.764 --> 17:06.078
yet one more message from Stamps.com.

17:06.114 --> 17:07.249
My goodness.

17:14.153 --> 17:16.189
Ah!

17:19.242 --> 17:20.476
Brockmire, what are you doing?

17:20.510 --> 17:22.111
Shit. Sorry.

17:22.144 --> 17:23.513
Force of habit.

17:25.548 --> 17:26.617
Who is it?

17:26.648 --> 17:29.320
Jim, Jules! Open up!

17:29.352 --> 17:31.455
- Oh, my God.
- Look. Hey.

17:31.487 --> 17:34.357
Okay, I had to come
over as soon as I heard.

17:34.390 --> 17:37.928
- Heard what?
- "This American Life."

17:37.960 --> 17:41.097
Jim, come here.

17:41.130 --> 17:43.234
Or stay. It's okay.

17:43.266 --> 17:45.268
This is... This is an excerpt
from Internet celebrity

17:45.302 --> 17:48.005
Jim Brockmire's new
podcast, "Brock Bottom."

17:48.037 --> 17:49.640
That's what he calls
it... it's "Brock Bottom."

17:49.672 --> 17:51.474
Each episode of the show includes

17:51.507 --> 17:54.644
everything from shameful
stories about his past

17:54.678 --> 17:57.247
to these improvised rants during games.

17:57.281 --> 18:00.117
I have to say, this is
like nothing else out there.

18:00.149 --> 18:02.285
I cannot recommend it highly enough.

18:02.319 --> 18:04.135
He likes him? That's neat.

18:04.228 --> 18:06.924
That guy's voice is like a human nap.

18:06.955 --> 18:08.425
I'm going back to bed.

18:08.457 --> 18:09.627
Jim, you don't get it!

18:09.659 --> 18:11.661
This is Ira Glass!

18:11.695 --> 18:14.249
He is the King Dick
of non-profit media.

18:14.327 --> 18:17.088
Look, getting a recommendation from him

18:17.142 --> 18:21.056
is like...
hall-of-famer...

18:21.197 --> 18:24.853
baseball guy saying that, um...

18:25.079 --> 18:28.438
other baseball person is
going to be the next great...

18:31.809 --> 18:33.511
- ...shortstop?
- I'm gonna have to insist

18:33.544 --> 18:36.179
that you learn something about baseball.

18:36.213 --> 18:37.815
Jim!

18:37.848 --> 18:40.151
Come on! He vouched for you!

18:40.184 --> 18:42.186
Hell, he recommended you!

18:42.218 --> 18:43.821
We are in the big time now.

18:43.853 --> 18:45.756
You may not feel it now,
but you better strap in

18:45.790 --> 18:47.959
'cause you're about
to feel the Glass bump.

18:47.992 --> 18:49.127
- That's right.
- Get out of my house.

18:49.159 --> 18:50.794
Okay. All right.

18:50.828 --> 18:52.964
- Get ready, Jim!
- Get out.

18:52.996 --> 18:56.500
- Get ready for it!
- Get out!

18:56.534 --> 18:58.268
Today, we bring you
stories of comeback kids.

18:58.302 --> 19:00.505
Coming up later, and your bird can sing!

19:00.537 --> 19:02.272
The incredible tale of one endangered

19:02.305 --> 19:04.141
California condor, but first...

19:04.175 --> 19:05.842
Blast from the Pastime...

19:05.876 --> 19:09.247
Can baseball save a town
destroyed by fracking?

19:09.280 --> 19:12.984
Jim Brockmire thinks it can.

19:16.152 --> 19:17.154
Never mind.

19:21.225 --> 19:23.528
Uh, hey there.

19:23.561 --> 19:26.164
Uh, Charles. Hey.

19:26.197 --> 19:29.300
Um, who are all these bespectacled

19:29.332 --> 19:31.268
and ironically dressed people?

19:31.302 --> 19:34.005
Remember when I told
you about the Glass bump?

19:34.037 --> 19:35.939
You got his fans.

19:35.973 --> 19:37.975
Rich white people who feel
bad about being rich and white

19:38.007 --> 19:40.577
who want an authentic experience
that doesn't scare them.

19:40.611 --> 19:42.446
Uh-huh.

19:42.478 --> 19:43.581
Howdy, folks.

19:43.613 --> 19:44.948
Hi!

19:44.982 --> 19:46.417
Mark!

19:46.449 --> 19:48.151
Find the money in the stands.

19:48.185 --> 19:50.154
If they're wearing a shirt for
a band you've never heard of,

19:50.187 --> 19:51.923
keep the beers flowing.

19:51.956 --> 19:53.925
Jules. What the hell is going on?

19:53.957 --> 19:55.892
This place looks like a god
damn Vassar College reunion.

19:55.926 --> 19:58.295
I don't have time for
your bullshit, Gary.

19:58.329 --> 19:59.897
Pennsylvania Shale may be just

19:59.929 --> 20:02.033
a mom-and-pop
natural-gas company

20:02.065 --> 20:04.434
that barely makes $2 billion a year.

20:04.467 --> 20:06.403
But if you and Ira Glass

20:06.437 --> 20:08.272
think you can crush us
under the boot of NPR,

20:08.304 --> 20:10.474
get ready for a big surprise.

20:10.506 --> 20:14.010
We can fight just as dirty as...

20:14.044 --> 20:15.912
Nobody fights dirtier than me.

20:15.946 --> 20:18.448
Hey, anybody seen Brockmire?

20:18.482 --> 20:22.119
That was a direct hit. Direct hit.

20:22.151 --> 20:24.054
We are definitely not the only
Brock-Heads in our neighborhood.

20:24.088 --> 20:26.190
- Brock-Heads? - We
would love to lure you

20:26.223 --> 20:27.625
out to Brooklyn for a show.

20:27.658 --> 20:29.025
- Yeah.
- So, uh, honey...

20:29.059 --> 20:31.162
- Here.
- Okay.

20:31.195 --> 20:33.197
Huh. Well, thank you, folks.

20:33.229 --> 20:34.931
Very nice to meet both of you.

20:34.965 --> 20:36.333
Thank you. Thanks. Thank you.

20:36.367 --> 20:37.601
Come on, honey.

20:37.634 --> 20:38.902
Okay.

20:38.936 --> 20:40.504
- Hi.
- Oh!

20:40.536 --> 20:43.140
Excuse me a second.

20:43.172 --> 20:44.140
Hey.

20:44.174 --> 20:45.443
- Hey.
- Look at this!

20:45.476 --> 20:48.178
Can you believe this,
darling? I owe it all to you.

20:48.211 --> 20:51.181
Um, actually, I'm the one
who came up with the podcasts.

20:51.215 --> 20:52.550
Yeah, but she was the
one that convinced me

20:52.582 --> 20:53.918
to follow my dream, all right?

20:53.950 --> 20:55.486
A dream which is looking like

20:55.518 --> 20:58.088
it's gonna get me the hell
out of Morristown, baby.

20:58.121 --> 21:00.024
So we are celebrating tonight,

21:00.056 --> 21:02.125
and I mean big time.

21:02.159 --> 21:04.027
- I can't drink.
- What are you talking about?

21:04.061 --> 21:07.063
Uh-oh. You got one of them...
one of them UTIs again?

21:07.097 --> 21:08.266
You on the antibiotics? All right.

21:08.299 --> 21:09.500
No booze, no booze. Hey.

21:09.533 --> 21:11.534
We'll just stick to the yayo.

21:11.567 --> 21:13.937
I'm pregnant.

21:24.148 --> 21:25.315
Oh.

21:29.119 --> 21:30.955
Attaboy.

21:42.265 --> 21:43.967
Sorry.

21:44.001 --> 21:45.336
Oh, Jesus.

21:46.637 --> 21:48.673
Get out of here!
