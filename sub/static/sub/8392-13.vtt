WEBVTT

00:00.960 --> 00:02.404
- BOBBY LITI'LE.
- I REMEMBER HIM.

00:02.510 --> 00:03.442
- YEAH,
HE'S RUNNING FOR CITY COUNCIL,

00:03.550 --> 00:05.711
AND HE ACTUALLY CALLED ME
TO RUN HIS CAMPAIGN.

00:05.830 --> 00:07.969
I GET TO HAVE AN ASSISTANT, AND
I IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT OF YOU.

00:08.070 --> 00:09.207
I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS.

00:09.310 --> 00:11.039
- PEOPLE PAY A LOT OF MONEY
FOR A BABY TH ESE DAYS.

00:11.140 --> 00:13.074
- I TOLD HIM
I DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM.

00:13.180 --> 00:14.624
HE'S REALLY MAD AT ME.

00:14.730 --> 00:16.903
I DON'T THINK HE'S EVER
GOING TO SIGN THOSE PAPERS.

00:17.010 --> 00:17.908
- OH,
LOOK AT HOW PRETTY YOU ARE.

00:18.010 --> 00:20.183
- I CAN TOTALLY SEE HAVING
A BABY WITH YOU.

00:20.290 --> 00:22.087
- HEY, HONEY,
THE SAN FRANCISCO WEEKLY

00:22.190 --> 00:23.873
IS PROBABLY GOING TO RUN
A STORY ON CROSBY AND ME

00:23.980 --> 00:25.015
FIXING UP
THE RECORDING STUDIO.

00:25.120 --> 00:25.916
WE NEED SOME LOCAL PRESS,
YOU KNOW.

00:26.020 --> 00:27.009
- WOW, THAT'S GREAT.

00:27.130 --> 00:27.983
- I'M EXCITED ABOUT IT,
YOU KNOW.

00:28.090 --> 00:30.297
- YEAH.
IT'S A GOOD THING.

00:30.400 --> 00:32.982
- THAT LITTLE CREASE
WILL NOT GO AWAY.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.192
- OKAY,
WE ABOUT DONE?

00:34.310 --> 00:36.164
- NO, NO, YOU HAVE
A VERY SHINY "T" ZONE.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.749
I'M JUST GETTING STARTED,
REALLY.

00:37.860 --> 00:38.997
- IT'S A LOT OF WORK,
ALL RIGHT.

00:39.100 --> 00:40.237
- YOU KNOW,
I ALWAYS TELL HIM

00:40.350 --> 00:42.443
HE SHOULD EXFOLIATE,
AND HE JUST WON'T LISTEN TO ME.

00:42.550 --> 00:44.199
- IT'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
I'M A BUSINESSMAN, RIGHT,

00:44.320 --> 00:46.459
I'M THE BEHIND-THE-SCENES GUY,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

00:46.560 --> 00:48.243
THE READERS OF
THE SAN FRANCISCO WEEKLY

00:48.350 --> 00:49.669
ARE GOING TO CARE WHETHER OR NOT
I HAVE A SHINY "T" ZONE.

00:49.770 --> 00:51.078
NO OFFENSE.

00:51.180 --> 00:53.148
- OKAY, ADAM, CAN YOU STOP
SAYING "BUSINESSMAN"?

00:53.260 --> 00:54.079
THAT'S--
YOU'VE GOT THE WRONG MAGAZINE.

00:54.190 --> 00:55.350
- THAT'S WHAT I AM.

00:55.460 --> 00:57.394
- YOU'RE A PARTNER
IN A VERY COOL AND HIP STUDIO.

00:57.500 --> 00:58.876
- ALL RIGHT, BUSINESS PARTNER
IN A COOL, HIP STUDIO.

00:58.980 --> 01:01.289
I DON'T THINK THEY'RE GOING
TO REALLY CARE ABOUT ME.

01:01.400 --> 01:02.298
- REALLY?

01:02.400 --> 01:04.083
JUST WIPE IT AWAY,
JUST WIPE MY WORK AWAY.

01:04.200 --> 01:05.713
THAT'S 20 MINUTES GONE.
WE HAVE TO START OVER NOW.

01:05.820 --> 01:06.673
- ALL RIGHT,
SORRY.

01:06.790 --> 01:08.712
- SO AM I.

01:08.820 --> 01:10.094
[telephone ringing]

01:10.200 --> 01:12.202
- NO, OKAY, SEE, THAT'S
NOT GONNA WORK FOR ME.

01:12.310 --> 01:13.857
I'M GONNA NEED YOU
TO FAX THAT OVER

01:13.970 --> 01:15.232
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

01:15.350 --> 01:17.898
- SORRY, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE THE COPY ROOM IS?

01:18.000 --> 01:19.888
WAS THAT EVEN A MOTION?

01:20.010 --> 01:20.999
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
THE COPY ROOM IS?

01:21.110 --> 01:23.032
YEAH, I DIDN'T THINK SO.
I'M FEELING INVISIBLE.

01:23.150 --> 01:24.629
- DO YOU--
- HEY, AMBER.

01:24.730 --> 01:25.970
- HI.
- WHAT'S WRONG?

01:26.080 --> 01:27.661
- I DON'T--
I GUESS I'M INVISIBLE TODAY.

01:27.770 --> 01:29.351
I-I CAN'T FIND THE COPY ROOM,
AND--

01:29.460 --> 01:31.667
- HONEY, RIGHT THERE.
COPY MACHINE.

01:31.780 --> 01:33.156
JUST, THERE'S JUST ONE,
AND WE DON'T HAVE A ROOM.

01:33.260 --> 01:35.057
- OKAY, YES.
GOT IT.

01:35.160 --> 01:36.081
THANK YOU.
- GOOD?

01:36.190 --> 01:38.078

REALLY DOING GOOD HERE.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.053
- GOOD JOB, HONEY.

01:39.160 --> 01:40.980
- YOU'R_E WELCOME.
- [Inhales]

01:41.100 --> 01:43.239
OKAY,
I CAN FIGURE THIS OUT, CAN'T I?

01:43.340 --> 01:46.138
THIS IS--
PEOPLE DO THIS EVERYDAY.

01:46.240 --> 01:47.264
COME ON, BUDDY.

01:47.380 --> 01:50.031
LET'S JUST GET ONE THING
GOING HERE.

01:50.140 --> 01:51.175
- CAN I SNEAK IN FOR ONE COPY?
- I'M SORRY.

01:51.280 --> 01:52.554
I'M SORRY, YOU CAN'T

01:52.660 --> 01:54.696
BECAUSE I'M HAVING
A REALLY STRESSFUL DAY HERE,

01:54.800 --> 01:56.791
AND I JUST GOT
TO GET THIS DONE, OKAY?

01:56.900 --> 01:57.969
- YES, ABSOLUTELY.

01:58.080 --> 02:02.949
- WAIT--FOR BOB LI'I'I'LE.
[laughs]

02:03.050 --> 02:04.119
- HI.
- HI, I'M AMBER.

02:04.220 --> 02:05.209
- AMBER,
IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

02:05.330 --> 02:06.638
- SORRY.
- NO, NO APOLOGY.

02:06.740 --> 02:08.014
- LET ME JUST GET
A COPY REAL QUICK.

02:08.120 --> 02:09.428
- YES, GO FOR IT, OBVIOUSLY.
- THANK YOU.

02:09.540 --> 02:13.124
- IT'S YOUR CAMPAIGN.
[copy machine buzzes]

02:13.230 --> 02:14.151
- THANKS.

02:14.270 --> 02:18.366
- SORRY.
- NO, NO.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.165
- GREAT.
IT'S GREAT.

02:21.270 --> 02:22.999
- UH, WELL,
I CAN'T REMEMBER A TIME

02:23.100 --> 02:25.660
WHEN I DIDN'T WANT
TO DO THIS ACTUALLY.

02:25.760 --> 02:28.752
WELL, EXCEPT SECOND GRADE.
I WANTED TO BE EVEL KNIEVEL.

02:28.870 --> 02:31.623
YOU REMEMBER THAT, ADAM,
WITH JUMPING THE MILK CRATES?

02:31.730 --> 02:33.004
- ABSOLUTELY.

02:33.110 --> 02:35.692
- BUT THEN I TOOK
MY FIRST GUITAR LESSON

02:35.810 --> 02:38.870
SO I GUESS YOU CAN SAY
MUSIC KIND OF SAVED MY LIFE.

02:38.980 --> 02:40.083
- THAT'S COOL.
- YEAH.

02:40.190 --> 02:42.988
- THAT'S THE GUITAR, ACTUALLY,
THAT I FIRST LEARNED TO PLAY ON.

02:43.090 --> 02:44.466
- SENTIMENTAL--
I LOVE IT.

02:44.570 --> 02:46.151
- YEAH, WELL, THIS PLACE
HAS SO MUCH MUSIC HISTORY

02:46.260 --> 02:48.012
I FELT
I SHOULD ADD MY OWN TO IT

02:48.130 --> 02:49.643
SO I KEEP
ALL MY OLD INSTRUMENTS HERE.

02:49.750 --> 02:52.196
IN FACT, THIS SG HERE
IS THE FIRST GUITAR

02:52.310 --> 02:53.379
I LEARNED TO PLAY
STAIRWAY TO HEAVENON.

02:53.480 --> 02:54.686
- THAT'S A BEAUTY.
- YEAH.

02:54.790 --> 02:56.439
LET'S GET THAT Si-IOT.
[camera shutter CIICKS]

02:56.550 --> 02:58.893
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I HAVE MY GUITAR

02:59.000 --> 03:00.547
FROM MY PUNK ROCK PHASE
UPSTAIRS.

03:00.660 --> 03:01.934
THAT MIGHT BE A COOLER PICTURE.

03:02.040 --> 03:03.928
I'M GONNA GRAB THAT.

03:04.040 --> 03:06.213
- HE'S ALWAYS LOOKING FOR
THE NEXT GREAT GUITAR, YOU KNOW.

03:06.320 --> 03:07.287
- YEAH.

03:07.390 --> 03:08.414
- HE WENT
THROUGH QUITE A FEW OF THEM.

03:08.530 --> 03:10.009
- YEAH, AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?

03:10.120 --> 03:12.111
TELL ME YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH MUSIC.

03:12.220 --> 03:14.632
- I ENJOY MUSIC.

03:14.740 --> 03:17.868
UM, MY BROTHER'S THE ONE
WHO'S GOT ALL THE PASSION.

03:17.990 --> 03:20.561
- WELL, YEAH, BUT YOU MUST SHARE
IT ON SOME LEVEL, RIGHT?

03:20.680 --> 03:23.080
OTHERWISE, HOW DO YOU UNDERTAKE
SUCH A HUGE ENDEAVOR

03:23.200 --> 03:24.679
AT THIS RISKY TIME?

03:24.790 --> 03:28.237
- WELL, HONESTLY, I AM STILL
SHOCKED THAT I WOUND UP HERE

03:28.340 --> 03:30.786
BECAUSE I USED TO WORK
IN THE SHOE INDUSTRY...

03:30.900 --> 03:32.401
- OH.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.896
- FOR 15 YEARS,
BUT THEN I LOST MY JOB, SO...

03:34.000 --> 03:35.274
- OH, SORRY.
LIKE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA.

03:35.380 --> 03:37.371
- YEAH, YEAH,
I GUESS.

03:37.490 --> 03:40.459
IT'S FUNNY, I-I SEE
THOSE UNEMPLOYMENT STATISTICS

03:40.560 --> 03:44.007
IN THE NEWSPAPER, AND YOU DON'T
THINK IT'S GOING TO BE YOU,

03:44.120 --> 03:46.213
AND SUDDENLY, THERE I WAS.

03:46.320 --> 03:48.663
UNEMPLOYED, TWO KIDS,
ANOTHER ONE ON THE WAY.

03:48.780 --> 03:51.044
- THAT'S SCARY.
- IT WAS SCARY.

03:51.160 --> 03:52.809
MY WIFE WAS REALLY FREAKED OUT.

03:52.920 --> 03:56.265
YOU KNOW, PREGNANT
AND I LINED UP THIS OTHER JOB

03:56.370 --> 03:58.679
THAT WAS A STEP DOWN, AND--
BUT ANYWAY,

03:58.790 --> 04:00.439
CROSBY, YOU KNOW,
MY KNOB-HEADED YOUNGER BROTHER

04:00.550 --> 04:03.269
CAME RUNNING AT ME WITH
THIS IDEA, THIS BIG CRAZY IDEA.

04:03.380 --> 04:05.132
AND HE SAW THIS PLACE,
AND HE HAD A VISION,

04:05.240 --> 04:08.653
YOU KNOW, AND IT WAS CRAZY,
YOU KNOW, IT TRULY WAS CRAZY.

04:08.760 --> 04:11.581
BUT, I DON'T KNOW.
IT WAS LIKE A DREAM.

04:11.690 --> 04:13.658
AND IT WAS AT A TIME WHEN I
DESPERATELY NEEDED A DREAM,

04:13.770 --> 04:19.527
SO I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
THAT MUSIC SAVED MY LIFE.

04:19.630 --> 04:20.494
WHOA.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.044
- OH, YEAH.
[laughs]

04:22.150 --> 04:23.139
- YEAH.
- NATURAL.

04:23.260 --> 04:26.354
- YEAH, YEAH, I'M A REAL--
A REAL ROCK STAR.

04:26.470 --> 04:28.085
- LET'S GET THIS SHOT,
PLEASE.

04:28.190 --> 04:31.057
[camera shutter clicks]

04:33.540 --> 04:35.679
- OKAY, SO EVERYTHING
LOOKS GREAT, SARAH,

04:35.790 --> 04:37.929
AND UNLESS
YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,

04:38.030 --> 04:39.509
I WILL SEE YOU...

04:39.620 --> 04:42.828
- UH, JUST ONE, ONE, UH--
SOMETHING I WAS WONDERING ABOUT.

04:42.930 --> 04:45.444
I WAS WONDERING ABOUT,
HYPOTHETICALLY,

04:45.560 --> 04:49.269
JUST THE ODDS
OR THE POSSIBILITY

04:49.390 --> 04:52.177
OF ME HAVING ANOTHER BABY.

04:52.290 --> 04:54.144
- REALLY?

04:54.250 --> 04:56.286
WELL, NO, THAT'S VERY--
THAT'S FANTASTIC.

04:56.390 --> 04:57.561
- IT'S A HYPOTHETICAL
AT THIS POINT.

04:57.670 --> 05:00.491
I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF IT'S EVEN POSSIBLE.

05:00.610 --> 05:04.398
I'M IN THIS RELATIONSHIP
WITH A GUY WHO'S YOUNGER

05:04.510 --> 05:07.365
AND HE KIND OF BROUGHT IT UP
AND THEN HE DROPPED IT,

05:07.470 --> 05:09.643
BUT SO I HAVEN'T REALLY EVEN
TALKED TO HIM ABOUT IT,

05:09.750 --> 05:11.377
BUT I JUST THOUGHT,
YOU KNOW, I SHOULD ASK.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.163
I MEAN, IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?

05:13.270 --> 05:15.067
- YES, BIOLOGICALLY,
IT IS POSSIBLE.

05:15.170 --> 05:16.398
- GREAT.

05:16.520 --> 05:17.726
- SO YOU THINK ABOUT,
AND WHEN YOU MAKE A DECISION,

05:17.830 --> 05:20.060
COME ON IN,
WE WILL RUN SOME PANELS,

05:20.180 --> 05:22.239
WE'LL TEST YOUR LEVELS TO MAKE
SURE EVERYTHING'S A-OKAY.

05:22.350 --> 05:25.035
- PANELS AND LEVELS...

05:25.150 --> 05:27.175
- YEAH, IT'S JUST--
IT'S A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED.

05:27.290 --> 05:28.518
YOU KNOW,
FOR OLDER WOMEN LIKE YOU.

05:28.630 --> 05:29.733
- HMM.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.284
- AND UM, IF IT DOESN'T WORK
THE NATURAL WAY,

05:31.400 --> 05:33.118
THEN YOU'VE GOT OPTIONS.

05:33.220 --> 05:34.289
- I THOUGHT 4O WAS THE NEW 30.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.776
- NOT FOR YOUR OVARIES,
NO.

05:35.880 --> 05:37.871
- I THINK THAT ABOUT COVERS IT.
- OKAY.

05:37.990 --> 05:39.810
- PUT MY PANTS ON AND LEAVE.
- OKAY.

05:39.920 --> 05:40.648
- OKAY.

05:40.750 --> 05:42.980
- TAKE CARE, SARAH.
LET ME KNOW.

05:43.100 --> 05:44.294
[door closes]

05:44.410 --> 05:47.618
- [sighs]
OH, MY GOD.

05:47.720 --> 05:50.234
- MAY GOD BLESS
AND KEEP YOU ALWAYS

05:50.350 --> 05:53.103
AND MAY YOUR WISHES
ALL COME TRUE

05:53.210 --> 05:55.201
MAY YOU ALWAYS DO
FOR OTHERS

05:55.320 --> 05:57.652
AND LET OTHERS DO FOR YOU

05:57.770 --> 06:00.284
MAY YOU BUILD A LADDER
TO THE STARS

06:00.390 --> 06:02.449
AND CLIMB ON EVERY RUNG

06:02.560 --> 06:04.972
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:05.080 --> 06:07.355
FOREVER YOUNG

06:07.470 --> 06:09.779
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE RIGHTEOUS

06:09.880 --> 06:12.223
MAY YOU GROW UP
TO BE TRUE

06:12.330 --> 06:14.776
MAY YOU ALWAYS KNOW
THE TRUTH

06:14.890 --> 06:17.199
AND SEE THE LIGHTS
SURROUNDING YOU

06:17.300 --> 06:19.780
MAY YOU ALWAYS BE
COURAGEOUS

06:19.890 --> 06:22.131
STAND UPRIGHT
AND BE STRONG

06:22.240 --> 06:24.026
AND MAY YOU STAY

06:24.140 --> 06:26.756
FOREVER YOUNG

06:26.860 --> 06:29.033
MAY YOU STAY

06:29.140 --> 06:32.143
FOREVER YOUNG

06:35.940 --> 06:37.589
- OOH, I GOT IT.
HOW ABOUT MY BUDDY, BILLY?

06:37.700 --> 06:38.621
- BILLY?
- MM-HMM.

06:38.740 --> 06:39.638
- FROM HIGH SCHOOL?
- MM-HMM.

06:39.740 --> 06:41.048
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
UH-UH.

06:41.150 --> 06:42.731
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH BILLY?
- HE'S INSANE.

06:42.850 --> 06:43.976
NO WAY.
THAT'S A VETO.

06:44.090 --> 06:45.045
- YOU DON'T GET TO VETO.
YOU GET TO VOTE.

06:45.160 --> 06:46.115
- I VOTE NO.

06:46.230 --> 06:48.221
- UNTIL I KNOW MORE OF THE FACTS
ABOUT THIS GUY,

06:48.330 --> 06:49.649
I CAN'T PUT IN MY VOTE, SO.

06:49.750 --> 06:50.978
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

06:51.100 --> 06:53.500
- WE'RE TRYING TO FIND ANOTHER
PLAYER FOR OUR POKER GAME.

06:53.620 --> 06:54.405
- YEAH,
AND CROSBY WANTS BILLY.

06:54.510 --> 06:55.579
- BILLY FROM HIGH SCHOOL?
- YEAH.

06:55.690 --> 06:57.066
- HE'S INSANE.
- OUT OF HIS MIND.

06:57.170 --> 06:58.205
- OH, PERFECT.

06:58.310 --> 06:59.516
- NO, HE'S UNIQUELY ECCENTRIC.

06:59.620 --> 07:03.033
- WHY DON'T YOU GUYS
ASK MARK?

07:03.140 --> 07:04.823
- MARK WHO?

07:04.940 --> 07:07.033
- MARK, MY BOYFRIEND.
- OH, RIGHT, MARK.

07:07.150 --> 07:08.412
- HER BOYFRIEND.

07:08.530 --> 07:11.169
- WELL, YOU KNOW, WE--
IT'S NOT A CASUAL GAME.

07:11.290 --> 07:13.906
IT'S A SERIOUS GAME, AND WE
TAKE IT PRETTY SERIOUSLY,

07:14.010 --> 07:15.637
AND WE'VE BEEN PLAYING
WITH EACH OTHER FOR A LONG TIME,

07:15.740 --> 07:18.425
AND WE PLAN ON PLAYING
WITH EACH OTHER FOR A LONG TIME.

07:18.540 --> 07:20.394
- I DON'T UNDER--
HE'S TOO CASUAL FOR YOU?

07:20.500 --> 07:21.535
WHAT?
- [sighs]

07:21.640 --> 07:23.323
- UM...
- WANT TO TAKE THIS?

07:23.440 --> 07:25.123
- LOOK, WHEN YOU GUYS BREAK UP,
WE'RE GOING TO BE STUCK

07:25.230 --> 07:26.640
WITH AN EMPTY SEAT AT THE TABLE,

07:26.750 --> 07:28.058
AND WE DON'T WANT TO PUT
OURSELVES IN THAT POSITION.

07:28.170 --> 07:29.125
YOU KNOW.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.571
- WHO SAYS WE'RE BREAKING UP?

07:30.690 --> 07:32.260
- WELL, WE GOT TO PLAY THE ODDS.
WE'RE POKER PLAYERS.

07:32.380 --> 07:33.893
- YOU KNOW WHAT,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

07:34.000 --> 07:35.228
WE'LL THINK ABOUT IT.
WE'RE GOING TO THINK ABOUT IT.

07:35.350 --> 07:36.305
- OH, MY GOD.

07:36.420 --> 07:37.648
- THAT LASAGNA SMELLS GOOD.

07:37.760 --> 07:38.897
- NOW GUYS, WHY DON'T
YOU HAVE HIM IN YOUR--

07:39.010 --> 07:40.693
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
MOM DIDN'T CALL DINNER.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.006
- I THINK SHE DID.
- WAIT.

07:42.110 --> 07:43.077
- I HEARD SOMEBODY.
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

07:43.180 --> 07:45.000
- HEY, SYD.

07:45.110 --> 07:47.112
GRAB YOUR SWEATER.
IT'S COLD OUT TODAY.

07:47.220 --> 07:49.871
- HEY, TELL ZOE WE HAVE TO LEAVE
IN TEN AS WELL, WOULD YOU?

07:49.980 --> 07:50.969
[telephone rings]
- NO, I CAN'T DO THAT.

07:51.090 --> 07:53.081
THAT IS JUST TOO WEIRD.
- [laughs] THAT'S--

07:53.190 --> 07:54.293
[ringing continues]

07:54.400 --> 07:55.492
- WHY DO WE STILL HAVE
A HOME PHONE?

07:55.610 --> 07:56.838
THE ONLY PEOPLE THAT CALL US
ON IT ARE TELEMARKETERS.

07:56.950 --> 07:58.087
- AND MY PARENTS.
- EXACTLY.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.019
- WHERE IS IT?
AH.

07:59.130 --> 08:00.984
[answering machine beeps]
- HEY, THIS IS TROY.

08:01.100 --> 08:02.852
ZOE'S BOYFRIEND.

08:02.960 --> 08:04.780
LOOK, SHE WON'T RETURN
ANY OF MY CALLS.

08:04.890 --> 08:06.403
UH, I KNOW SHE'S BEEN STAYING
OVER THERE

08:06.520 --> 08:07.612
FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS.

08:07.720 --> 08:08.926
HAVE HER CALL ME.
WE NEED TO TALK.

08:09.040 --> 08:10.132
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:10.240 --> 08:11.343
- CALLING HIM BACK.

08:11.450 --> 08:12.200
I DON'T KNOW
HOW HE GOT THIS NUMBER,

08:12.310 --> 08:13.891
BUT HE IS
NEVER CALLING HERE AGAIN.

08:14.010 --> 08:14.931
- LISTEN,
JUST BECAUSE SHE LIVES WITH US

08:15.040 --> 08:16.075
DOESN'T MEAN
WE CAN SCREEN HER CALLS.

08:18.010 --> 08:19.454
AND I DON'T WANT HIM
IN HER LIFE,

08:19.560 --> 08:20.800
I DON'T WANT HIM
IN THE BABY'S LIFE.

08:20.910 --> 08:22.354
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED,
WE DELETE THE MESSAGE

08:22.460 --> 08:23.427
AND PRETEND HE NEVER CALLED.

08:23.530 --> 08:24.633
- WE CAN'T DO THAT.

08:24.740 --> 08:26.287
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- CAN WE DO THAT?

08:26.400 --> 08:28.049
- [sighs]
DON'T MIND ME.

08:28.160 --> 08:30.253
I'M JUST A GIANT
COMING DOWN THE STAIRS.

08:30.370 --> 08:31.598
MORNING.

08:31.710 --> 08:34.019
- MORNING.
- MORNING.

08:49.040 --> 08:50.621
- IT SOUNDS TINNY.

08:50.730 --> 08:52.379
- SOUNDS GREAT IN HERE.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.481
MIGHT JUST BE YOUR--
YOUR HEADPHONES.

08:54.600 --> 08:55.828
- ARE--ARE YOU SURE, LIKE--

08:55.940 --> 08:57.521

09:01.050 --> 09:03.564
JUST BARGE IN HERE.
HERE WE GO.

09:03.680 --> 09:05.466
SO, OKAY.

09:05.570 --> 09:06.980

- YEAH.

09:07.090 --> 09:09.058
UH, YOU WANT TO HEAR IT?
- BACK FOR A SEC?

09:09.160 --> 09:10.570
IT SOUNDS GREAT.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.955
- NO, I BE--I BELIEVE YOU
THAT IT SOUNDS GREAT.

09:13.060 --> 09:14.948
I'M JUST--OKAY, I'M JUST--
I'M SORRY.

09:15.070 --> 09:17.061
I'M BEING A LITTLE
CONTROL-Y ABOUT THIS,

09:17.170 --> 09:17.750
BUT I JUST--
- OH, NO.

09:17.860 --> 09:19.441
YOU THINK SO?
NO, IT'S FINE.

09:19.550 --> 09:20.448
- NO, I JUST--I JUST--

09:20.560 --> 09:22.039
I NEED TO HEAR
THAT IT SOUNDS GREAT.

09:22.140 --> 09:23.107
AND THEN I CAN FOCUS,
YOU KNOW.

09:23.210 --> 09:26.031
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S--LET'S HEAR IT TOGETHER.

09:26.150 --> 09:29.529
- [sighs]

09:29.630 --> 09:32.667
- SEE, NOT TINNY.
SOUNDS GOOD.

09:32.770 --> 09:34.397
- NO, IT'S THIN,
THOUGH.

09:34.500 --> 09:35.728
- OH, YOU THINK IT SOUNDS THIN.

09:35.850 --> 09:36.942
- YEAH, IT DOES SOUND THIN.
AND IT DOES.

09:37.050 --> 09:38.915
- IT SOUNDS--IT SOUNDS PURE.
IT SOUNDS LIKE A CELLO.

09:39.020 --> 09:39.987
- [sighs]

09:40.090 --> 09:41.569
- I MEAN, WE COULD START
MANIPULATING THE SOUND,

09:41.680 --> 09:43.022
BUT I THINK THEN
IT'S JUST GOING TO SOUND

09:43.130 --> 09:44.438
LIKE A SYNTHESIZER,
AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT THAT.

09:44.540 --> 09:46.019
- NO, I DON'T, I DON'T.
- RIGHT?

09:46.130 --> 09:47.097
- YEAH, BUT--
- LOOK, YOU'RE AN ARTIST.

09:47.200 --> 09:49.304
AND I THINK YOU'RE NERVOUS,
AND I UNDERSTAND,

09:49.410 --> 09:50.638
BUT YOU JUST NEED TO TRUST

09:50.760 --> 09:51.988
THAT I'M GOING TO MAKE IT
SOUND REALLY GOOD.

09:52.100 --> 09:53.829
- [sighs]
I DON'T NEED IT TO SOUND GOOD.

09:55.690 --> 09:56.964
[cell phone rings]
- OKAY.

09:57.070 --> 09:58.583
- SO THAT'S WHY--
- SO SORRY.

09:58.700 --> 10:00.691
CAN WE JUST--
SORRY ABOUT THIS.

10:00.800 --> 10:02.620

10:03.700 --> 10:04.598

10:04.700 --> 10:06.076
UH-HUH.

IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT.

10:40.530 --> 10:42.327
OH, MY GOODNESS.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.610
SO JUST RELAX.

12:05.720 --> 12:07.233
- YOU KNOW, IT WOULDN'T KILL YOU
TO LET YOURSELF GET EXCITED.

12:07.340 --> 12:08.648
- I AM EXCITED.

12:08.760 --> 12:09.613
- IT'S THE COVER
OF THE SAN FRANCISCO WEEKLY.

12:09.720 --> 12:10.721
- I AM EXCITED.

12:10.830 --> 12:11.854
I'M JUST NOT, LIKE,
OVERLY EXCITED.

12:11.970 --> 12:12.925
- TELL YOUR FACE
THAT YOU'RE EXCITED.

12:13.040 --> 12:13.995
- CHAMPAGNE.
- LOOK, CHAMPAGNE FOR DINNER.

12:14.110 --> 12:15.486

YOU SEEM KIND OF MAD.

12:43.310 --> 12:44.789
- NOT MAD.

12:47.210 --> 12:49.724
IS THIS SOME KIND OF
NEW POWER CHORD YOU'VE INVENTED?

12:49.830 --> 12:51.070
BECAUSE I'M NOT
FAMILIAR WITH TH E--

12:51.180 --> 12:52.078

12:53.700 --> 12:54.724
AND THEN

12:54.840 --> 12:56.046
- NO, I GET IT,

12:56.150 --> 12:57.185
I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU COULD DO AN ENTIRE INTERVIEW

12:57.290 --> 12:58.564
IN THE TWO MINUTES
THAT I WAS OUT OF THE ROOM.

12:58.670 --> 12:59.876
LIKE, THAT'S IMPRESSIVE.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.868
- OKAY, YOU'RE MAD.

13:01.980 --> 13:03.493

13:14.100 --> 13:15.476

THE STORY I KNOW THAN THE ONE

13:30.560 --> 13:31.595
THAT'S DEPICT ED ON THE ART.

13:31.700 --> 13:34.703

13:59.940 --> 14:03.000

A CHANCE TO MENTION IT TO YOU.

14:06.050 --> 14:08.041
WE HAVE MONTHLY POKER GAME,

14:47.160 --> 14:49.048
[clicks tongue]

14:49.160 --> 14:51.390
CAN YOU TRY TO PRETEND LIKE
YOU'RE INTO THIS, OR--

14:51.510 --> 14:53.432
- I'M INTO IT.
I THINK IT SOUNDS GREAT.

14:53.540 --> 14:55.019
- OKAY, BECAUSE
I WAS THINKING THAT

14:55.130 --> 14:56.950
IT NEEDED TO BE
COMPRESSED DOWN JUST A BIT.

14:57.060 --> 14:58.266
- YOU THINK IT NEEDS TO BE COM--

14:58.380 --> 15:03.158
OKAY.
- JUST--JUST A TOUCH.

15:03.280 --> 15:05.168
WELL, DON'T--DON'T DO IT,
JUST--

15:05.280 --> 15:06.861
- DON'T DO THE THING
YOU JUST ASKED ME TO DO?

15:06.970 --> 15:09.689
- NO, DON'T DO IT
JUST BECAUSE I SUGGESTED IT.

15:09.800 --> 15:11.768
LIKE, I WANT YOUR OPINION.

15:11.870 --> 15:15.874
I WANT THE FAMOUS COVER BOY
SOUND ENGINEER'S OPINION.

15:15.980 --> 15:18.119
I AM PAYING

SO MAYBE YOU NEED HIS OPINION.

15:20.850 --> 15:22.465
HE'S--

15:22.570 --> 15:23.639

I'M A LITTLE BIT FRIED.

15:23.750 --> 15:24.739

PICK THIS UP TOMORROW.

15:25.780 --> 15:26.917
- FINE.

15:27.020 --> 15:32.094

15:32.200 --> 15:35.988

15:36.100 --> 15:37.681
- NEUROSES?
- I DIDN'T MEAN--

15:37.790 --> 15:39.792
LIKE I'M NEUROTIC BECAUSE I
REALLY CARE ABOUT THIS PROJECT?

15:39.900 --> 15:43.449
BECAUSE I'M NOT FAMOUS,
AND I'M PAYING OUT OF MY POCKET,

15:43.560 --> 15:45.619
AND I'M PAYING AN HOURLY RATE
AND IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME?

15:45.730 --> 15:49.006
NO RECORD LABEL IS PAYING
FOR MY SESSION WITH YOU?

15:49.120 --> 15:50.496
OKAY, THIS MEANS A LOT TO ME,

15:50.600 --> 15:52.909
SO I DON'T THINK A LITTLE
RESPECT FROM YOU 15--

15:53.020 --> 15:54.976
- IT'S NOT THAT
I DON'T RESPE--

15:55.090 --> 15:56.159
WHAT--WHAT IS THAT?

15:56.260 --> 15:58.364
- CRAMP.

16:00.020 --> 16:01.464
- BAD ONE, MY BOW HAND.

16:01.580 --> 16:02.956
- DO YOU WANT ME
TO CALL A DOCTOR OR--

16:03.060 --> 16:04.220
- NO, IT'S A HAND CRAMP,
NOT A HEART ATTACK.

16:04.340 --> 16:05.602
JUST HELP ME.
- HOW DO YOU I HELP YOU?

16:05.720 --> 16:06.789

16:12.730 --> 16:13.924
- THAT'S GOOD?

16:14.040 --> 16:14.995
THIS IS WHAT I DO
FOR A CHARLEY HORSE.

16:15.110 --> 16:17.556
IS THAT--
IS THAT WORKING?

16:17.660 --> 16:20.345
- [sighs]
OH.

16:20.460 --> 16:23.179
THAT'S FROM PRACT ICING
TEN HOURS A DAY.

16:23.290 --> 16:24.837
- TEN HOURS?

16:24.940 --> 16:26.077
I WOULD PRACTICE MORE
THAN TEN HOURS,

16:26.190 --> 16:28.146
BUT I HAVE TO STOP
AT 10:00 P.M.

16:28.260 --> 16:30.706
BECAUSE MY NEIGHBORS
WERE COMPLAINING.

16:30.810 --> 16:33.370
THAT'S HOW MUCH
THIS MEANS TO ME.

16:33.470 --> 16:36.462
SO I DON'T THINK THAT
A LITTLE EFFORT FROM YOU

16:36.580 --> 16:37.808
IS TOO MUCH TO ASK.

16:37.920 --> 16:41.742
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

16:41.860 --> 16:45.239
- OKAY.

16:45.340 --> 16:49.379

16:53.080 --> 16:55.241
- THANK YOU.

16:55.350 --> 16:56.931
YOU DO KNOW THAT WORD.

16:57.050 --> 16:58.529
OH, THAT MUST HAVE HURT
LIKE HELL.

16:58.630 --> 17:02.873
- HEY, WELL,
IT FEELS BETTER NOW, SO...

17:02.980 --> 17:05.562
THANK YOU.

17:08.990 --> 17:10.366
- HEY, GUYS.

17:10.470 --> 17:13.268
CAN YOU PLEASE RAISE YOUR HAND
IF YOU'RE UNDER 25?

17:13.370 --> 17:14.849
ALL RIGHT,
I NEED A FOCUS GROUP.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.370
YOU GUYS ARE MY DEMOGRAPHICS.

17:16.480 --> 17:18.266
SO LET'S MEET IN THE BULLPEN

WONDERFUL.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.008

17:33.120 --> 17:34.041
UH, I'M NOT GOING

17:39.570 --> 17:42.016

19:29.510 --> 19:31.193
IT'S GREAT PUBLICITY
FOR THE STUDIO,

19:31.300 --> 19:32.437
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS,
RIGHT?

19:32.550 --> 19:33.926
- I TOLD MYSELF

19:34.030 --> 19:35.406

I WOULD LIKE THAT.

I MEAN, I WAS BEING AS
CHARISMATIC AS I HAVE EVER BEEN.

19:54.080 --> 19:55.217
AND THEN, NOTHING.

19:55.330 --> 19:57.218
- OH, BUT MAN,

19:57.330 --> 19:59.605

IF YOU WANT.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.746
JUST SITTING THERE.

20:56.870 --> 20:59.486
- BABE.

21:07.190 --> 21:09.750
- NO.
I JUST KNOW YOU.

21:09.850 --> 21:13.229
AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T NOT DO
THE RIGHT THING.

21:13.340 --> 21:16.639
IT WAS THE EIIIGHT THING.

21:16.750 --> 21:20.197
I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS OR NOT.

21:20.310 --> 21:22.995
- HOW'D SHE TAKE IT?

21:23.100 --> 21:25.682
- I COULDN'T TELL YOU.
SHE JUST SHUT ME OUT.

21:25.800 --> 21:27.176
SHE WOULDN'T TALK
TO ME AT ALL.

21:27.280 --> 21:28.588
- YEAH.

21:28.700 --> 21:32.932
- I MEAN, SHE'S IN SUCH PAIN,
AND SHE WON'T LET ME HELP.

21:33.050 --> 21:34.278
I DON'T KNOW.

21:34.390 --> 21:37.735
- YOU THINK
SHE'S GOING TO CALL HIM?

21:37.840 --> 21:39.216
- YOU KNOW,
SHE SAID SHE WOULD MAKE SURE

21:39.330 --> 21:40.536
THAT HE DIDN'T CALL HERE,

21:40.640 --> 21:42.289
SO THAT IMPLIES
SOME KIND OF COMMUNICATION.

21:42.400 --> 21:43.708
- YEAH.

21:43.810 --> 21:46.267
- NOT A DAMN THING
I CAN DO ABOUT THAT.

- UH, IN THE UNIVERSE WHERE
I'M DATING HIS LITTLE SISTER,

23:08.900 --> 23:11.061
AND HE'S A FULL FOOT
TALLER THAN ME

23:11.180 --> 23:13.341
AND HAS A DEEP, SCARY VOICE.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.688
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO
ARM WRESTLE.

23:14.800 --> 23:17.109
HE'S JUST, YOU KNOW,
TRYING TO GET TO KNOW YOU.

23:17.220 --> 23:19.768
- WELL, JUST THE WAY HE SAID IT,
IT WAS LIKE--

23:19.880 --> 23:22.212
- AW.
- I DON'T KNOW, I--

23:22.330 --> 23:23.877
MAYBE I'M OVER-THINKING IT.

23:23.980 --> 23:25.117
- AW, LOOK.

23:25.230 --> 23:28.085
SLIPPERS, BUT IT'S A BUNNY.

23:28.190 --> 23:30.124
- THIS ISN'T A BIG DEAL,
RIGHT?

23:30.230 --> 23:32.403
I MEAN,
YOU DON'T REALLY CARE

23:32.510 --> 23:34.091
IF I PLAY POKER
WITH YOUR BROTHERS OR NOT.

23:34.200 --> 23:34.882
- WHAT, THE GAME?
NO.

23:34.990 --> 23:35.740
- OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
- OF COURSE NOT.

23:35.860 --> 23:37.748
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.
- OKAY.

23:37.860 --> 23:40.237
- I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE NICE
FOR YOU GUYS TO KNOW EACH OTHER,

23:40.340 --> 23:43.992
BUT YOU KNOW,
WHATEVER.

23:44.110 --> 23:46.135
- OKAY, WELL,
I'LL--I'LL GIVE IT A SHOT,

23:46.250 --> 23:48.935
AND THEN,
IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT,

23:49.040 --> 23:50.860
THEN WHO CARES?

23:50.980 --> 23:52.527
- YEAH, IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT,
WHO CARES?

23:52.630 --> 23:55.428
- OKAY.
GOOD.

23:55.530 --> 23:59.318
WHEW.

23:59.430 --> 24:02.183
- MMM

24:02.300 --> 24:07.909
BE MY LOVE

24:13.690 --> 24:15.829
- SO, WHY DON'T YOU TELL US
ABOUT THIS MARK GUY?

24:15.930 --> 24:16.680
- YEAH,
HE'S A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER.

24:16.800 --> 24:18.449
HE'S A--
HE'S A NICE GUY.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.369
- NICE GUY?
CAN HE PLAY CARDS?

24:20.490 --> 24:21.718
- YEAH.
- REALLY.

24:21.830 --> 24:22.728
SERIOUSLY,
HE'S A GOOD POKER PLAYER.

24:22.840 --> 24:26.310
- WHOA, CHECK OUT
THE FAMOUS BRAVERMAN.

24:26.430 --> 24:28.000
[laughs]

24:28.120 --> 24:29.633
JULIA SAID YOU GUYS
GOT INTERVIEWED.

24:29.740 --> 24:31.116
SHE DIDN'T SAY
YOU MADE THE COVER.

24:31.220 --> 24:32.255
LOOK AT THAT.

24:32.360 --> 24:33.281
- WHAT A PHOTO.

24:33.400 --> 24:35.015
- I THOUGHT
THAT CAME OUT TOMORROW?

24:35.120 --> 24:36.564
- YEAH, WELL,
THE REPORTER CAME BY

24:36.680 --> 24:38.227
AND DROPPED OFF
SOME ADVANCE COPIES.

24:38.330 --> 24:39.979
- NICE.

24:40.090 --> 24:41.159
- "MUSIC SAVED MY LIFE.

24:41.270 --> 24:42.544
"WE CHAT WITH ADAM BRAVERMAN."

24:42.650 --> 24:43.571
- JOEL, COME ON.

24:43.680 --> 24:45.261
- THAT IS FREAKING ADORABLE.

24:45.380 --> 24:46.779
- THANKS A LOT, JOEL.

24:46.890 --> 24:47.822
YOU LOOK GOOD IN THAT JACKET.
MAN, THAT'S HUGE.

24:47.930 --> 24:48.749
- I LOVE THAT.

24:48.860 --> 24:49.679
- HEY, LOOK WHO'S HERE.
HEY, MARK.

24:49.790 --> 24:50.722
- HEY.
- HEY, GUYS.

24:50.830 --> 24:54.618
- I-I BROUGHT BISCOTTI.

24:54.730 --> 24:56.516
- THAT RIGHT?

24:56.630 --> 24:57.767
THAT'S NICE.

24:57.870 --> 24:59.724
- NOT A REAL POKER GAME
WITHOUT BISCOTTI, RIGHT?

24:59.840 --> 25:01.148
I'M KIDDING.
THAT WAS A JOKE.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.218
THESE ARE PHILLY CHEESESTEAKS
FROM THE PLACE ON THE CORNER.

25:03.320 --> 25:06.016
THEY GAVE ME A PINK BOX,
AND I--

25:06.120 --> 25:07.087
- A LITTLE SCARED THERE.

25:07.190 --> 25:08.566
[laughter]

25:08.670 --> 25:09.602
[overlapping conversation]

25:09.710 --> 25:11.052
- HERE'S MARK.
MARK, KAL, JON.

25:11.160 --> 25:12.388
THIS IS MARK.
- MARK.

25:12.510 --> 25:13.704
- ALL RIGHT.
PHILLY CHEESESTEAKS.

25:13.820 --> 25:14.889
[overlapping chatter]

25:14.990 --> 25:15.979
- ALL RIGHT,
ENOUGH WITH THE KISSING.

25:16.100 --> 25:16.885
HERE COMES THE PAIN.

25:16.990 --> 25:17.957
WHAT WE'RE DOING
IS HOLD 'EM,

25:18.060 --> 25:19.163
AND THE BLINDS ARE
TWO AND FIVE.

25:19.270 --> 25:20.339
LET'S GET TO IT.
COME ON.

25:20.440 --> 25:21.441
DID EVERYBODY GET A COPY?

25:21.550 --> 25:24.201
- COME ON, MAN.
- HEY!

25:24.310 --> 25:27.177
[soft guitar music]

25:32.660 --> 25:36.141
-IAM...

25:36.250 --> 25:39.947
I WILL RAISE.

25:40.050 --> 25:41.563
- UM, WAIT, YOU CAN'T.
YOU HAVE--

25:41.670 --> 25:42.841
- WHAT?

25:42.950 --> 25:44.394
- YOUR RAISE
HAS TO MATCH THE BIG BLINDS.

25:44.500 --> 25:45.842
- OH, OKAY.
- YOU REMEMBER THAT THERE?

25:45.950 --> 25:46.700
- AH, YES.

25:46.820 --> 25:49.129
THEN I WILL CHECK.

25:49.230 --> 25:50.959
- NAH, NAH, YOU CAN'T CHECK,
ROOKIE.

25:51.060 --> 25:52.470
YOU GOT TO MAKE
THAT BET WHOLE.

25:52.580 --> 25:53.990
- GIVE HIM A BREAK, KAL.

25:54.100 --> 25:56.443
- NAH, I'M FINE.
JUST HOW MUCH DO I PUT IN?

25:56.550 --> 25:58.711
ONE OF THE REDS.

25:58.830 --> 26:00.206
- WELL, LET'S REWRITE
THE RULES OF POKER.

26:00.310 --> 26:01.789
- I WILL--
- CAN YOU CHECK?

26:01.900 --> 26:03.822
DON'T FEEL THE PRESSURE OF IT.

26:03.940 --> 26:05.100
- YEAH, A LITTLE,
LITTLE PARTIAL RAISE.

26:05.210 --> 26:07.075
- I'M GOING
TO MAKE A PROPER RAISE.

26:07.180 --> 26:08.249
- OH, REALLY?
- AND THERE IT COMES.

26:08.350 --> 26:10.170
- SO PROPER.
- BIG COJONES.

26:10.290 --> 26:12.076
- DO YOU REALLY THINK YOUR FLUSH
IS GOING TO TAKE THIS THERE,

26:12.190 --> 26:12.872
KALCIFICATION?

26:12.980 --> 26:16.108
- YES, I DO,
AND TO QUOTE YOU...

26:16.220 --> 26:16.948
- NO, PUT IT DOWN.

26:17.050 --> 26:18.984
"IT IS A DREAM
IN A TIME IN MY LIFE

26:19.090 --> 26:20.398
WHEN I DESPERATELY
NEED A DREAM."

26:20.500 --> 26:21.364
[laughter]
- ALL RIGHT.

26:21.470 --> 26:23.051
- I'LL FOLD.

26:23.160 --> 26:24.024
- OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

26:24.130 --> 26:25.028
I FOLD.

26:25.130 --> 26:27.542
YOU KNOW, "SOME MEN
WERE BORN TO TAKE RISKS,

26:27.650 --> 26:30.130
"AND SOME MEN HAVE RISKS
THRUST UPON THEM

26:30.240 --> 26:31.582
BECAUSE THERE'S
SIMPLY NO OTHER OPTION."

26:31.690 --> 26:33.134
JUST OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.

26:33.240 --> 26:35.549
- ET TU,JOEL?
ET TU?

26:35.660 --> 26:38.208
- "AND I, LIKE OTHER AMERICANS,

26:38.320 --> 26:41.596
NEED TO BELIEVE THAT
THERE'S STILL HOPE OUT THERE."

26:41.700 --> 26:43.213
- THAT ONE MADE ME CRY/BARF.
- [laughs]

26:43.320 --> 26:44.287
- YOU KNOW WHAT,

26:44.390 --> 26:45.618
THIS IS
A REALLY HYSTERICAL BIT,

26:45.740 --> 26:47.731
BUT IT'S GETTING A LITTLE LONG
IN THE TUBE,

26:47.840 --> 26:49.728
SO I'M ALL IN.

26:49.840 --> 26:51.637
- OH, WELL, WE CALL THAT
AN ANGER RAISE.

26:51.740 --> 26:53.219
THAT'S THE TERM.

26:53.330 --> 26:56.675
- I WILL GO ALL IN AS WELL.
- THAT'S...ANGRIER.

26:56.780 --> 26:58.020
- HEAR THAT?
- BIG TIME.

26:58.130 --> 26:59.267
- GETTING SO ANGRY.
- [grunts]

26:59.370 --> 27:00.598
THAT MEANS I'M OUT.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.051
- SEE YOU.

27:02.170 --> 27:03.888
- I'M SORRY, MARK.
I GOT THE BOAT ON THE RIVER.

27:04.000 --> 27:05.262
- OH, YEAH.
THERE IT IS.

27:05.380 --> 27:06.688
- OH, WAIT A MINUTE.

27:06.790 --> 27:08.030
YOU GOT A BOAT, QUEENS UP.

27:08.140 --> 27:09.926
THAT MEANS HE TRAPPED YOU,
BIG BOY.

27:10.040 --> 27:10.995
- HE GOT YOU BEAT.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

27:11.110 --> 27:12.134
- I WIN?

27:12.250 --> 27:14.480
- YUP.
- OH, MY GOD.

27:14.590 --> 27:15.625
[clears throat]
- TAKE ALL OUR MONEY.

27:15.730 --> 27:17.482
- [clears throat]
- A REAL SANDBAGGER.

27:17.600 --> 27:19.079
- ALL RIGHT.
- I LIKE POKER.

27:19.180 --> 27:22.115
- WE'RE GOING TO NEED YOU
TO RUN OUT FOR BISCOTTI.

27:22.220 --> 27:24.700
- YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T KEEP POURING, SISTER.

27:24.810 --> 27:27.984
- IT'S THE FIRST RELATIONSHIP
I CAN REALLY IMAGINE

27:28.090 --> 27:30.741
GOING ALL THE WAY,
YOU KNOW?

27:30.850 --> 27:32.078
HE SAID TO ME THE OTHER DAY,

27:32.200 --> 27:34.259
"I COULD TOTALLY SEE
HAVING A BABY WITH YOU."

27:34.370 --> 27:35.268
AND I--
- WHAT?

27:35.370 --> 27:37.361
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

27:37.480 --> 27:38.435
HE SAID THAT?
- YEAH.

27:38.550 --> 27:39.448
- THAT'S AMAZING.

27:39.550 --> 27:40.517
- AND IT FELT SO GOOD,

27:40.620 --> 27:42.019
AND THEN WE NEVER
TALKED ABOUT IT AGAIN.

27:42.140 --> 27:43.960
SO THEN I'M
JUST CARRYING IT AROUND.

27:44.070 --> 27:45.059
- YOU THINK HE FORGOT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

27:45.180 --> 27:47.034
- NO, HE'S NOT A KNUCKLEHEAD.
HE DIDN'T FORGET.

27:47.140 --> 27:49.449
- I DON'T KNOW HIM VERY WELL.

27:49.560 --> 27:51.289
- MAYBE HE'S NOT SERIOUS, AND
HE'S SORT OF CHANGED HIS MIND.

27:51.390 --> 27:53.858
- NO, MAYBE HE REALLY LOVES YOU,
BUT IT SCARED HIM.

27:53.980 --> 27:58.565
[overlapping discussion]

27:58.670 --> 27:59.591
- ZOE?
HI.

27:59.710 --> 28:00.665
- HEY.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.919
- TH ESE AREHTI’IY SISTERS.

28:03.020 --> 28:04.226
- SO YOU'RE GOING OUT?
- YUP.

28:04.330 --> 28:05.706
- OKAY.
- YOU KNOW.

28:05.820 --> 28:06.775
- UM, IT'S LATE.
DO YOU NEED A CAB--

28:06.890 --> 28:09.358
- NO, I'M GOOD, SO.
- OKAY.

28:09.480 --> 28:10.742
HAVE FUN.
- MM-HMM.

28:10.860 --> 28:11.952
- WHERE IS SHE GOING?

28:12.060 --> 28:13.266
- I DON'T KNOW
WHERE SHE'S GOING.

28:13.380 --> 28:15.439
I KNOW WHERE
I HOPE SHE'S NOT GOING,

28:15.550 --> 28:20.135
BUT I'M TRYING TO BE RESPECT FUL
OF HER PRIVACY.

28:20.250 --> 28:21.797
EVEN THOUGH
SHE IS LIVING IN MY HOUSE,

28:21.900 --> 28:22.969
AND SHE IS CARRYING MY BABY.

28:23.080 --> 28:24.627
- I THINK THAT--THAT'S GOOD.

28:24.730 --> 28:25.799
- WEIRD.
- IT'S SO HARD.

28:25.910 --> 28:27.172
I'M HAVING
A ROUGH TIME WITH IT.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.110
I'M REALLY CURIOUS.
- TRACKING DEVICE IN HER CAR.

28:29.220 --> 28:30.733
- LISTEN, YOU CAN'T TELL ME
I HAVE TO ASK

28:30.840 --> 28:33.559
MY BOYFRIEND IF HE WANTS
TO HAVE A BABY WITH ME,

28:33.670 --> 28:35.183
AND THEN YOU NOT TELL--
YOU NOT ASK--

28:35.290 --> 28:36.530
- THIS IS APPLES AND ORANGES.
- NO, IT ISN'T.

28:36.640 --> 28:37.538
- LISTEN.

28:37.640 --> 28:39.949
YOU JUST MAKE HIM
A NICE BREAKFAST,

28:40.060 --> 28:42.119
AND HAVE A CONVERSATION.

28:42.230 --> 28:43.743
LIKE, HEY,
EVERYTHING'S WONDERFUL.

28:43.860 --> 28:45.714
- IT'S LIKE
A BUSINESS MEETING?

28:45.820 --> 28:47.708
- [laughing]
- THANK YOU FOR COMING FOR EGGS.

28:47.820 --> 28:49.060
THERE'S SOMETHING
I NEED TO TALK ABOUT--

28:50.140 --> 28:53.166
[laughter]

28:53.280 --> 28:56.249
- MY NEW GOAL IS
TO GO HOME WITH GAS MONEY.

28:56.350 --> 28:57.248
YOU LIKE THAT?

28:57.350 --> 28:58.271

28:58.390 --> 28:59.482
- AND MINE.

29:05.770 --> 29:07.499
AND I'LL GET YOU TOMORROW?

29:07.600 --> 29:08.840
- HERE WE GO.

29:08.950 --> 29:12.181
YOUR POKER DEBT IS WELL
INTO THE SIX FIGURES, MY FRIEND.

29:12.300 --> 29:14.632
I THINK YOU MIGHT WANT
TO JUST WALK AWAY.

29:14.750 --> 29:17.025

29:17.130 --> 29:18.574
- HUH.
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT?

29:18.680 --> 29:19.601
NEVER MIND.

29:19.720 --> 29:20.709
DON'T DO IT,
DON'T DO IT.

29:20.820 --> 29:22.162
- OH, YOU THREW
A "YOU KNOW WHO IN THERE."

29:22.270 --> 29:23.407
- [laughs]
- IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

29:23.520 --> 29:24.475
- HEY, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO COP AN ATTITUDE

29:24.590 --> 29:26.091
OVER LOANING ME 20 BUCKS--

29:26.210 --> 29:27.859
- I WOULDN'T HAVE AN ATTITUDE
IF YOU EVER PAID ME BACK.

29:27.970 --> 29:29.176
- OH...
- GOING DOWN.

29:29.280 --> 29:31.032
- AND YOU'RE BEING SERIOUS?

I'VE BEEN CHILL
ALL NIGHT LONG

29:45.300 --> 29:46.847
WHILE YOU SIT THERE AND PRETEND
THAT YOU'RE ANNOYED

29:46.950 --> 29:48.702
BY ALL THIS ATTENTION.

29:48.820 --> 29:50.219
VERY CONVINCING.

29:50.340 --> 29:52.854
- YEAH, YOU'RE REALLY CHILL,
AREN'T YOU?

29:52.960 --> 29:55.474
OKAY, WELL, WHY DON'T
WE JUST TALK ABOUT IT LATER?

29:55.580 --> 29:56.808
- ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I'M GOING TO LEAVE.

29:56.930 --> 29:58.090
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- YOU TAKE IT BACK.

29:58.210 --> 29:59.370
YOU GUYS HAVE FUN.

30:04.380 --> 30:08.862
YOU HAD TO BRING THOSE
MAGAZINES HERE, DIDN'T YOU?

30:08.970 --> 30:11.074
- THEY'LL WORK IT OUT.

30:13.080 --> 30:14.149
- WHAT, YOU THINK YOU CAN GET
OVER YOURSELF

30:14.260 --> 30:15.284
AND COME BACK TO THE GAME?

30:15.390 --> 30:16.527
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

30:16.640 --> 30:18.426
I ASKED YOU IF YOU WERE MAD,
YOU SAID YOU WERE COOL ABOUT IT.

30:18.540 --> 30:21.293
- YEAH, I SAID I WASN'T MAD
BECAUSE I WAS BEING NICE.

30:21.400 --> 30:22.082
THAT'S WHAT PARTNERS DO.

30:22.190 --> 30:23.817
THEY ALSO APOLOGIZE
TO ONE ANOTHER

30:23.920 --> 30:24.705
WHEN THEY SCREW
EACH OTHER OVER.

30:24.820 --> 30:26.094
- REALLY?

30:26.200 --> 30:27.337
- ALL YOU GOT TO DO
IS SAY, "I'M SORRY."

30:27.440 --> 30:28.338
- I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY,
"I'M SORRY" FOR, OKAY?

30:28.440 --> 30:30.408
I JUST ANSWERED
A COUPLE SIMPLE QUESTIONS,

30:30.510 --> 30:31.954
AND YOU WENT TO GET
YOUR PUNK PHASE GUITAR

30:32.070 --> 30:33.332
SO YOU COULD GET BACK
TO GRANDSTANDING

30:33.450 --> 30:34.303
IN FRONT OF THE REPORTER.

30:34.410 --> 30:36.298
- I'M SORRY SHE HAPPENED
TO LIKE MY ANGLE BETTER.

30:36.420 --> 30:38.035
- YOU KNOW WHAT, IF I HAD GONE
INTO THE SHOE BUSINESS WITH YOU,

30:38.140 --> 30:40.483
AND THEY NAMED ME
THE MOST IMPORTANT SHOE DESIGNER

30:40.590 --> 30:43.275
OF THE YEAR Al-TER I'VE BEEN IN
THE BUSINESS FOR FIVE SECONDS,

30:43.390 --> 30:45.597
THAT WOULD BOTH ER YOU
BECAUSE THAT'S YOUR DREAM,

30:45.700 --> 30:47.144
AND I WOULD SAY, "SORRY."

30:47.250 --> 30:48.421
- I DIDN'T WANT TO BE
ON THE COVER OF THE MAGAZINE.

30:48.530 --> 30:51.010
I HAD NO IDEA THAT YOUR NEED
FOR ATTENTION WAS SO GREAT.

30:51.120 --> 30:52.087
- OH, THIS IS CRAP.
- OH, NO, IT'S NOT.

30:52.190 --> 30:55.227
- JUST ADMIT IT.
ADMIT YOU LIKE IT.

30:55.330 --> 30:56.911
- OKAY, CROSBY,
I ADMIT IT.

30:57.020 --> 30:58.055
I LIKE IT, OKAY?

30:58.160 --> 30:59.741
I LIKE BEING
ON THE COVER OF THE MAGAZINE.

30:59.850 --> 31:01.090
I LIKE THE FACT
THAT THE REPORTER FOUND

31:01.200 --> 31:02.599
A LITTLE CHAPTER OF MY LIFE
INTERESTING.

31:02.720 --> 31:05.029
I LIKE THAT MY SON WHO DOESN'T
PAY ANY ATTENTION TO ME

31:05.130 --> 31:06.927
SUDDENLY THOUGHT I WAS COOL,
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

31:07.030 --> 31:08.543
TOMORROW, EVERYTHING IS GOING
TO RETURN TO NORMAL,

31:08.650 --> 31:10.060
AND I AM GOING
TO BE THE BORING BUSINESS GUY,

31:10.170 --> 31:15.073
AND YOU GET TO GO BACK TO BEING
COOL, HIP CROSBY, ALL RIGHT?

31:15.180 --> 31:18.308
- I'M CALLING IT A NIGHT.

TO DISCUSS WITH YOU.

31:59.220 --> 32:00.255
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

32:00.360 --> 32:01.839
- THERE'S A MATTER
THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS

32:01.950 --> 32:03.224
THAT BOTH
KRISTINA AND JULIA

32:03.330 --> 32:07.050

32:10.270 --> 32:13.023

YOU SAID YOU WANTED TO HAVE--

32:28.390 --> 32:34.078
MAYBE HAVE A BABY, AND THEN WE
NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT AGAIN.

32:34.190 --> 32:36.636
- I SAID--
YES, THAT'S TRUE.

32:36.740 --> 32:37.729
I DID.
I DID SAY THAT.

32:37.850 --> 32:40.637
I...[inhales]

32:40.750 --> 32:42.741
I THINK THIS IS A CONVERSATION
WE SHOULD HAVE

32:42.850 --> 32:44.715
WHEN WE'RE SOBER.

32:44.820 --> 32:45.855
IN THE MORNING.

32:45.960 --> 32:47.029

32:47.130 --> 32:49.303
WHY NOT--
I'M FINE.

32:49.410 --> 32:51.162
- NO, I-I'M--

32:51.270 --> 32:54.580
I WOULD FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE
IF WE DID IT TOMORROW

32:54.690 --> 32:56.487
IN THE LIGHT OF DAY.

32:56.590 --> 32:57.864

FUNCTIONING.

33:00.250 --> 33:02.138

IF YOU WOULD LIKE THAT.
IT MIGHT HELP.

38:38.790 --> 38:39.996
DON'T BE SORRY.

I'M GLAD YOU BROUGHT THAT UP.

38:41.970 --> 38:43.790
- NO, NO.
IT'S OKAY.

38:43.900 --> 38:45.174
- NO, I THINK IT'S SOMETHING
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT.

38:45.280 --> 38:48.556
- NO, IT'S OBVIOUSLY,
IT'S--

38:48.670 --> 38:50.695
IF YOU BROUGHT SOMETHING UP
AND DIDN'T BRING IT UP AGAIN,

38:50.810 --> 38:53.449
IT'S BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING
YOU DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT

38:53.570 --> 38:57.085
OR YOU KNOW, CHANGED YOUR MIND,
FORGOT, WHATEVER.

38:57.190 --> 38:59.988
AND IT'S OKAY BECAUSE
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU,

39:00.090 --> 39:01.079
I DON'T WANT TO PUSH IT.

39:01.200 --> 39:05.057
- SARAH, I-I-I DIDN'T FORGET
ABOUT THE BABY THING.

39:05.170 --> 39:09.163
I'VE BEEN--I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT A LOT, ACTUALLY.

39:09.270 --> 39:10.919
BECAUSE I--
IT SORT OF FREAKED ME OUT

39:11.030 --> 39:15.444
WHEN I SAID IT, YOU KNOW,
AND SINCE THEN,

39:15.560 --> 39:19.200
I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING ABOUT
WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN.

39:19.320 --> 39:20.799
I MEAN,
NOT--NOT JUST A BABY,

39:20.910 --> 39:23.219
BUT EVERYTHING THAT
THAT WOULD MEAN.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.594
LIKE,
WHAT THAT MEANS FOR US,

39:24.700 --> 39:26.076
AND WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN
FOR OUR LIVES,

39:26.190 --> 39:28.499
AND HOW THINGS WOULD CHANGE,

39:28.600 --> 39:33.048
AND IT DOES STILL

39:33.160 --> 39:34.673
KIND OF FREAK ME OUT...

39:34.780 --> 39:36.293
- ME, TOO.

39:36.400 --> 39:37.958
- BUT IN A GOOD WAY.

39:38.060 --> 39:43.168
IN A GOOD,
KIND OF EXCITED SORT OF WAY.

39:43.270 --> 39:47.138
SO...

39:47.240 --> 39:51.518
I GUESS IT IS SOMETHING THAT
WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT.

39:56.040 --> 39:59.931
BUT WOULD
YOU LIKE SOME BREAKFAST FIRST?

40:00.050 --> 40:01.278
- I COULD USE SOME TOAST.

40:01.390 --> 40:03.460
- SOME TOAST?
ALL RIGHT.

40:07.880 --> 40:10.360
- HEY.

40:10.470 --> 40:12.813
- HEY.

40:12.920 --> 40:15.229
- GOT YOU A DOUBLE SHOT THERE.

40:15.340 --> 40:17.126
THOUGHT YOU MIGHT NEED IT.

40:17.240 --> 40:19.686
- OH, THANK YOU.
- WHAT YOU DOING?

40:19.790 --> 40:25.751
- WELL,

40:25.870 --> 40:29.795
SO...

40:32.220 --> 40:33.767
LOOKS PRETTY, COOL, HUH?

40:33.870 --> 40:37.772
- I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHT,
BUT YOU KNOW,

40:37.880 --> 40:39.017
I'VE GOT ONE HANGING
ON THE FRIDGE AT HOME.

40:39.120 --> 40:40.940
THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.

40:41.050 --> 40:43.325
- WELL, THIS COULD BE
YOUR ONLY SHOT AT LOOKING COOL.

40:43.440 --> 40:45.579
YOU MIGHT WANT TO TAKE IT.
YOU NEVER KNOW.

40:45.680 --> 40:48.740
- YEAH,
YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.

40:50.960 --> 40:52.473
- THANKS.

40:52.580 --> 40:55.708
- LISTEN, YOU KNOW,

41:00.350 --> 41:02.932
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

41:03.040 --> 41:04.962
YOU DID.
