00:02.040 --> 00:07.560
WOMAN CRYING OUT
Oedipus Rex, Hamlet, Woyzeck,

00:07.560 --> 00:15.320
Ubu Roi, Faust,
all tortured souls... <font color="lime">Why?</font>

00:15.320 --> 00:20.520
..all rebelling against
social conventions. <font color="lime">Why?!</font>

00:20.520 --> 00:24.760
Beaten down by the rules
imposed by their masters.

00:24.760 --> 00:27.360
Your masters!

00:27.360 --> 00:30.240
Time to rise up!

00:31.400 --> 00:34.320
Destruction equals freedom.

00:34.320 --> 00:39.840
BOTH: Destruction equals freedom!
Destruction equals freedom!

00:39.840 --> 00:44.960
Release him!
Release the inner chaos.

00:44.960 --> 00:48.800
<font color="cyan">Destruction equals freedom!
</font>ALL: Destruction equals freedom!

00:48.800 --> 00:53.920
Destruction equals freedom!
Destruction equals freedom!

00:53.920 --> 00:58.480
I thought this was going to be a
nice open-air theatre production.

00:58.480 --> 01:02.960
Isn't it marvellous? They're
so unpredictable, dangerous.

01:02.960 --> 01:05.680
I have no idea what is going on.

01:05.680 --> 01:07.640
They're a performance troupe
of anarchists.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.000
They believe in change through
destruction.

01:10.000 --> 01:13.640
They believe in utter nonsense,
as far as I'm concerned.

01:13.640 --> 01:16.677
Destruction equals freedom!
Destruction equals freedom!

01:16.702 --> 01:18.407
Destruction equals freedom!
Destruction equals freedom!

01:18.440 --> 01:21.280
I didn't know you were a
supporter of the arts, Inspector.

01:21.318 --> 01:23.118
We're just here to
keep the peace, Father.

01:23.158 --> 01:27.878
Wherever this troupe of ruddy
misfits tour they incite violence.

01:27.903 --> 01:30.383
Why on Earth did you let them
use your farm?

01:30.408 --> 01:33.848
My wife's idea. She's an old
friend of the director's.

01:33.873 --> 01:35.827
What? That nutcase?

01:35.852 --> 01:37.212
They'll be gone by this evening.

01:37.237 --> 01:39.532
They're just passing through
on their way to Birmingham.

01:40.848 --> 01:44.088
Destruction equals freedom!
Destruction equals freedom!

01:48.447 --> 01:51.887
Society is an illusion.

01:52.285 --> 01:56.245
Ghosts of the mind.

01:56.270 --> 01:59.375
All that matters is the individual!

02:59.861 --> 03:01.901
Allow me, sir.

03:04.460 --> 03:07.022
What is it with you and dead people?

03:07.047 --> 03:08.607
Just in the wrong place.

03:08.632 --> 03:09.872
At the right time?

03:11.580 --> 03:14.260
Well, put your back into it!

03:14.260 --> 03:17.300
<font color="lime">It won't budge, sir.</font> Stand back.

03:17.831 --> 03:19.671
Oh, Lionel.

03:23.222 --> 03:25.062
One of your actors?

03:25.080 --> 03:28.360
Yes, and the troupe's writer.

03:28.360 --> 03:31.200
He said he wanted
somewhere quiet to work.

03:31.200 --> 03:33.764
The window won't open, sir.

03:33.789 --> 03:36.709
And the door was bolted
from the inside.

03:36.734 --> 03:39.667
Lionel often locked himself away
when finishing a script.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.575
He didn't like to be disturbed.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.896
Do you recognise the gun?

03:45.080 --> 03:46.640
I'll ask the questions, Padre.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.600
You're a witness, not Dick Tracy.

03:48.600 --> 03:50.009
It's Lionel's.

03:50.280 --> 03:51.680
Why would a writer have a gun?

03:51.680 --> 03:52.877
Protection.

03:53.440 --> 03:55.936
Our plays have made us quite
a few enemies.

03:55.961 --> 03:57.717
Mainly right-wing extremists.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.320
Spare me the politics.

04:02.400 --> 04:03.800
Looks like suicide.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.080
All yours, Padre.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.520
Your attention, please.

04:28.520 --> 04:32.496
Nobody is to leave the premises
until I say so.

04:32.729 --> 04:36.315
Just when I thought things couldn't
possibly get any worse.

04:38.171 --> 04:40.091
I had a peep through the window.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.482
Gruesome! Blood and brains
splattered all over the glass.

04:43.546 --> 04:44.986
Oh, Penelope.

05:00.560 --> 05:03.240
<font color="yellow">Titan.</font> Finally get you alone.

05:04.321 --> 05:05.841
Poor Lionel.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.720
You must be very upset.

05:07.720 --> 05:09.920
He was a true anarchist
and I admired him for it,

05:09.920 --> 05:12.800
but as a man he was an
obnoxious bore.

05:15.280 --> 05:18.452
You know, I thought I'd never see
you again.

05:18.825 --> 05:20.622
You've hardly changed.

05:20.647 --> 05:21.687
You have.

05:25.620 --> 05:27.970
What happened to that
wild child I used to know?

05:28.560 --> 05:31.520
She's still here somewhere inside.

05:33.280 --> 05:34.600
I kept the locket you gave me.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.400
Don't change the subject.

05:37.520 --> 05:38.894
I'm married.

05:48.840 --> 05:50.848
Well, that's a disgrace.

05:51.720 --> 05:54.080
A married woman carrying
on like that.

05:54.080 --> 05:56.118
We all need a bit of passion, Mrs M.

05:56.192 --> 05:58.072
You should give it a whirl.

05:59.440 --> 06:00.640
HE CHUCKLES

06:06.360 --> 06:11.189
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you
the epitome of outdated values,

06:11.320 --> 06:13.049
the Catholic priest.

06:17.080 --> 06:18.727
Read about your performances.

06:20.186 --> 06:21.342
Very interesting.

06:21.367 --> 06:22.631
Really?

06:23.160 --> 06:25.722
They've caused a lot of unrest
in some towns.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.120
Protests, riots.

06:28.120 --> 06:31.788
We are merely arming
the people with the truth.

06:31.960 --> 06:33.569
A noble cause.

06:34.483 --> 06:36.123
You don't sound convinced.

06:36.240 --> 06:40.440
Is it the truth that's important
or the chaos you leave behind?

06:41.720 --> 06:46.155
A puppet of the Vatican such as
you could never understand

06:46.180 --> 06:49.240
the true nature of anarchy.

06:49.240 --> 06:50.608
HE BURPS

07:02.893 --> 07:04.933
<font color="yellow">Do you want a tea?</font> No.

07:06.935 --> 07:09.295
<font color="yellow">Something wrong?</font> You tell me.

07:10.680 --> 07:13.280
You're the one who seems tense.

07:13.280 --> 07:15.200
Well, after Lionel's suicide...

07:15.200 --> 07:18.280
Please, don't take me for a fool.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.571
I've seen the way you look at Titan.

07:22.634 --> 07:26.240
<font color="yellow">Don't be silly.</font> I'm not the one
behaving like some love-struck girl.

07:32.019 --> 07:33.266
And Sally.

07:35.521 --> 07:37.255
Wipe that make-up off your cheek.

07:57.720 --> 08:01.301
Just because he's dead
I'm not going to pretend.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.400
Well, if I'm honest
he was pretty vile.

08:05.398 --> 08:06.760
Made my skin crawl.

08:08.727 --> 08:10.280
I thought you were limping.

08:10.280 --> 08:11.527
When did that happen?

08:11.552 --> 08:12.752
Yesterday.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.120
I dropped a hammer on it.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.376
Looks nasty.

08:16.723 --> 08:18.443
Give it a rub for me later.

08:20.520 --> 08:23.227
Stop it. You know
I've got a wife in Glasgow.

08:23.252 --> 08:25.392
Yeah, how boringly conventional.

08:25.760 --> 08:27.600
I was 18. I didn't know any better.

08:27.705 --> 08:29.680
But you do now, so?

08:33.720 --> 08:37.799
I have to say, I found your
performance exhilarating.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.559
<font color="lime">Thanks.</font> I've really never
seen anything like it.

08:40.559 --> 08:41.907
I'm sure you haven't.

08:42.160 --> 08:46.561
It's inspired me to write something
myself - a poem, about anarchy.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.520
I don't suppose you'd give
me some tips?

08:48.520 --> 08:50.375
You should ask my father.

08:50.508 --> 08:52.080
TITAN: Time for the second half.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.579
I thought it was cancelled out of
respect for Lionel.

08:54.688 --> 08:58.273
My dear boy, you're not
thinking like an anarchist.

08:58.760 --> 09:01.920
We don't conform to
such social conventions.

09:01.920 --> 09:03.600
Like marriage.

09:03.781 --> 09:06.600
Any anyway, the Inspector has
insisted that no-one leaves.

09:06.600 --> 09:09.360
So that means the audience
can't escape.

09:10.277 --> 09:11.966
What about Lionel's part?

09:12.714 --> 09:16.227
Well, If you want to know about
anarchy, you can do it.

09:16.480 --> 09:19.550
Me? Well, I don't know what to do.

09:19.575 --> 09:22.924
Where's your sense of adventure?
Just copy the others!

09:28.299 --> 09:29.499
Sergeant...

09:31.230 --> 09:34.360
..did anyone hear the gunshot
that killed Lionel?

09:35.480 --> 09:37.760
Farmer Clegg and his wife
heard something, Father.

09:37.760 --> 09:39.816
But they assumed it was from
the neighbouring estate.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.660
Ladies and gentlemen.

09:42.526 --> 09:46.093
The second half is about to begin...

09:46.315 --> 09:47.196
Penelope...

09:47.221 --> 09:49.455
..commencing with some
excerpts from Hamlet.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.962
Oh, Shakespeare,
well, that's better.

09:53.399 --> 09:54.954
How weary...

09:55.400 --> 09:56.532
..stale...

09:57.160 --> 09:58.391
..flat..

09:58.600 --> 10:04.741
..and unprofitable, seem to me,
all the uses of this world.

10:04.991 --> 10:06.765
Oh, wretched state!

10:06.836 --> 10:09.343
Oh, bosom black as death!

10:09.880 --> 10:13.606
Something is rotten in the
state of Denmark.

10:13.631 --> 10:16.391
Or is it England with her
corrupt leaders?!

10:16.563 --> 10:18.339
That's not Shakespeare.

10:18.364 --> 10:21.388
Should we suffer their
slings and arrows?

10:21.413 --> 10:24.717
No! We should take arms
against them!

10:28.120 --> 10:29.820
Oh, not again.

10:40.360 --> 10:41.881
Mrs McCarthy.

10:41.906 --> 10:44.535
I have had quite enough
of this nonsense!

10:44.560 --> 10:46.987
I'm afraid nobody's
allowed to leave yet.

10:47.800 --> 10:49.160
Father Brown!

10:59.278 --> 11:00.576
For the shock.

11:04.443 --> 11:06.560
Do you think the deaths
are connected?

11:07.257 --> 11:08.481
I doubt it.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.953
The police seemed very sure
Lionel killed himself.

11:13.776 --> 11:15.472
My father would never do that.

11:17.160 --> 11:21.494
He was angry at life
but he loved it, too.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.000
I know.

11:25.080 --> 11:26.600
It's just not fair.

11:28.975 --> 11:30.495
He can't be gone.

11:50.648 --> 11:52.997
They're still unsure about
the cause of death,

11:53.022 --> 11:56.316
but they don't think it was
an accident.

12:01.028 --> 12:03.068
Oh, Angus.

12:10.612 --> 12:11.806
Hold me.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.303
Please!

12:20.120 --> 12:21.440
SHE SOBS

12:30.666 --> 12:33.566
Two ruddy corpses right
under our noses!

12:33.660 --> 12:35.440
The Chief Super isn't going to
be happy, sir.

12:35.440 --> 12:37.789
Oh, really? I thought he'd be
ecstatic!

12:38.343 --> 12:40.560
You need to speak to everyone here.

12:40.560 --> 12:41.760
I already have, sir...

12:41.760 --> 12:45.948
Then do it again! Well, move your
backside, Sergeant!

12:48.120 --> 12:49.290
Constable.

12:56.684 --> 12:58.120
What are you thinking, Father?

12:58.120 --> 13:00.234
That I need to speak to Magdalena.

13:00.762 --> 13:02.344
She's in the farmhouse.

13:09.594 --> 13:11.129
How are you now, Mrs M?

13:11.544 --> 13:13.264
Fine. Fine.

13:13.400 --> 13:16.240
At least, I will be as soon as
I get back home.

13:17.360 --> 13:20.369
I doubt she'd be that upset if
her husband died.

13:20.394 --> 13:22.906
She looks frightful. Poor Mrs Clegg.

13:23.868 --> 13:26.468
It's not her you should be
sorry for.

13:41.283 --> 13:43.059
Thought this might help.

13:43.868 --> 13:45.628
That's very kind.

13:48.450 --> 13:49.850
I know people are gossiping.

13:49.875 --> 13:50.975
No.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.483
Yes, but who cares?

13:57.932 --> 14:01.112
You're adding a little drama
to their dreary lives.

14:05.172 --> 14:06.972
So, did you know Titan well?

14:09.200 --> 14:11.040
I met him in London years ago,

14:11.040 --> 14:12.602
when I was an art student.

14:12.627 --> 14:15.754
Really? I thought you'd been here
forever.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.787
That's what most people think.

14:19.280 --> 14:20.992
Were you two close back then?

14:23.280 --> 14:27.786
He represented all that
was missing in my life.

14:28.076 --> 14:32.116
<font color="cyan">Danger. Passion.
</font><font color="lime">How terribly romantic.</font>

14:34.826 --> 14:38.626
And then I moved back here
and ended up as a farmer's wife.

14:41.028 --> 14:43.948
I wonder who hated Titan
enough to kill him.

15:03.160 --> 15:04.960
Inspector. Not now, Padre.

15:04.960 --> 15:06.766
I think I know what killed Titan.

15:08.472 --> 15:11.152
Magdalena said nuts
were poison to him.

15:11.433 --> 15:13.404
Titan's cheek was all bloated.

15:13.603 --> 15:15.203
His flask.

15:15.228 --> 15:17.148
There's almonds in it.

15:17.280 --> 15:20.320
So any more nutty theories?

15:21.800 --> 15:24.360
Lionel's suicide, it was murder.

15:24.360 --> 15:25.720
Based on what evidence?

15:25.720 --> 15:29.360
If he'd shot himself in the head
there would've been more...damage.

15:30.384 --> 15:33.600
His wounds suggest that he
was shot from further away.

15:33.940 --> 15:35.720
How is murder possible?

15:35.720 --> 15:38.017
The window of the outbuilding
doesn't open, the door was

15:38.042 --> 15:43.190
bolted from inside, and the gun he
was shot with was lying next to him.

15:47.610 --> 15:49.321
Both killed on the same day.

15:49.891 --> 15:52.077
It's too much of a coincidence.

15:52.946 --> 15:54.066
Yeah.

15:56.560 --> 15:59.280
Inspector, have there been any
developments?

15:59.280 --> 16:00.400
Nothing conclusive.

16:00.400 --> 16:01.560
So, in the meantime,

16:01.560 --> 16:04.146
both of you need to stay another
night at the farm.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.240
What? Are we suspects?

16:06.240 --> 16:09.080
As outsiders, I don't want you
leaving Kembleford.

16:09.080 --> 16:11.200
And if we stay here we could be
murdered in our beds.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.120
The killer could be out
there, just waiting.

16:15.120 --> 16:16.252
They have a point, sir.

16:16.320 --> 16:18.940
Looks like members of the theatre
troupe are being targeted.

16:19.560 --> 16:22.800
Well, in that case, I'd better
place a guard here tonight,

16:22.800 --> 16:24.573
hadn't I, Sergeant?

16:30.600 --> 16:33.020
Sergeant Goodfellow says we're
free to go home.

16:33.240 --> 16:36.400
And about time, too. Excuse me.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.986
I suppose if Titan had any enemies,
you'd know about them.

16:51.760 --> 16:53.160
Too many to name.

16:54.800 --> 16:57.040
Some accused him of being a
communist,

16:57.040 --> 16:59.120
others called him a fascist.

16:59.305 --> 17:00.664
What do you think?

17:01.760 --> 17:04.540
He was a good man - to me, anyway.

17:05.280 --> 17:08.130
He took me from the slums of Glasgow
and taught me everything I know.

17:08.251 --> 17:09.891
About anarchy?

17:10.040 --> 17:13.012
It's the only way to achieve
real change, Father.

17:14.775 --> 17:16.450
Do you really believe that?

17:17.359 --> 17:20.946
By destroying the bad in society
new things emerge.

17:21.160 --> 17:24.221
But what if you destroy the good
parts in the process?

17:24.540 --> 17:25.880
Is that acceptable?

17:25.880 --> 17:27.742
HORN BLARES

17:28.520 --> 17:30.202
Excuse me.

17:47.120 --> 17:50.249
<font color="lime">Magdalena.</font> Can I come in?

17:50.695 --> 17:52.850
I'm just getting ready for bed.
What do you want?

17:52.914 --> 17:55.658
I can't be alone. Not tonight.

17:56.291 --> 17:58.400
You'll be fine, the Sergeant
is in the house.

18:00.147 --> 18:02.212
Angus, I've just lost my father.

18:03.000 --> 18:05.680
Please, let me sleep in your bed.

18:09.413 --> 18:11.293
I can't do that to my wife.

18:12.687 --> 18:13.847
Not again.

18:15.440 --> 18:16.800
She's not here.

18:17.612 --> 18:18.900
She'll never know.

18:22.240 --> 18:23.520
I'm sorry.

18:24.429 --> 18:26.657
Just look at what you're
turning down.

18:27.809 --> 18:29.769
Magdalena...

18:34.997 --> 18:36.557
Just look.

18:40.999 --> 18:42.296
HE SIGHS

18:46.120 --> 18:47.520
Goodnight.

19:07.383 --> 19:08.583
Sally?

19:11.666 --> 19:13.053
Are you awake?

19:15.120 --> 19:16.440
You know I am.

19:19.120 --> 19:21.070
What is it about him?

19:21.937 --> 19:23.280
Don't do this.

19:23.280 --> 19:24.640
I need to know.

19:27.435 --> 19:29.240
Was he so much more of a
man than me?

19:29.240 --> 19:31.560
<font color="yellow">Stop it, Daffyd.
</font><font color="cyan">Is that what it was?</font>

19:34.640 --> 19:38.592
Well? Tell me.

19:39.720 --> 19:41.560
Just tell me!

19:43.325 --> 19:45.605
All right, if that's what you want.

19:50.612 --> 19:52.960
He was like no-one I'd ever met.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.144
In what way?

19:58.080 --> 20:01.200
He was wild...

20:02.560 --> 20:03.961
..like an animal.

20:04.782 --> 20:06.189
Is that it?

20:07.560 --> 20:08.920
There must be more.

20:10.640 --> 20:11.800
He wanted me.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.440
He wanted me with all his soul.

20:16.640 --> 20:17.804
No...

20:19.007 --> 20:20.038
..he didn't.

20:21.754 --> 20:22.831
What do you mean?

20:24.430 --> 20:27.832
I gave him £50 to leave you
alone and he accepted.

20:31.912 --> 20:32.760
SHE SCOFFS

20:33.006 --> 20:35.600
Titan was a man of principle,
he wouldn't do that.

20:35.625 --> 20:38.562
<font color="cyan">It's the truth.</font> You're a liar!
It was a last resort.

20:39.625 --> 20:43.877
I tried threatening him
but he just laughed at me.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.221
What?

20:47.984 --> 20:51.850
I told him to stay away
from you or I'd kill him.

20:56.487 --> 20:58.641
<font color="cyan">Sally...</font> Stay away from me!

20:58.922 --> 21:00.400
He threatened to kill Titan!

21:00.400 --> 21:03.160
What's that? <font color="yellow">He admitted it to me.
</font>Is this true?

21:03.160 --> 21:04.520
Yes, but I didn't mean it.

21:04.520 --> 21:07.800
Daffyd Clegg, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of murder.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.480
How could you?

21:09.505 --> 21:12.545
<font color="lime">Miss, get back. Miss, now.</font> I didn't
do it, I swear. <font color="lime">This way, sir.</font>

21:13.016 --> 21:15.615
<font color="cyan">Sally, you have to believe me.
</font>You're not obliged to say anything

21:15.640 --> 21:18.243
but anything you do say may be taken
down and given in evidence.

21:20.982 --> 21:24.120
<font color="cyan">This is ridiculous. I'm innocent.
</font>You can tell that to the Inspector.

21:24.120 --> 21:26.400
<font color="yellow">Help!</font> Come with me.

21:45.960 --> 21:49.120
Destroy. Rebel.

21:51.520 --> 21:55.920
Bunty, are you all right?
You look in pain.

21:55.920 --> 21:58.000
Oh, yes.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.520
I'm just trying to finish
my poem about anarchy.

22:00.520 --> 22:02.600
I want it to be really
visceral and shocking.

22:02.600 --> 22:06.663
Father, I have just been talking
to the ladies of the WI.

22:06.688 --> 22:08.995
Kembleford's very own gossip
network.

22:09.199 --> 22:12.935
And Farmer Clegg has been
arrested for murder. <font color="lime">Really?!</font>

22:12.960 --> 22:16.840
And Angus was found unconscious
at the back of the farmhouse -

22:16.840 --> 22:18.888
left for dead.

22:19.225 --> 22:21.145
Do you think he was guilty, Father?

22:21.200 --> 22:23.817
Farmer Clegg had a motive
for killing Titan.

22:23.898 --> 22:26.886
<font color="lime">Jealousy.</font> I thought it
was him all along.

22:28.120 --> 22:31.851
But why harm Angus,
or indeed Lionel?

22:32.341 --> 22:35.520
Bunty, may I trouble you for a lift?

22:35.520 --> 22:40.720
Father. Whatever you are up to,
please, please be careful.

22:40.720 --> 22:43.480
Mrs McCarthy, I am always careful.

22:52.480 --> 22:53.720
Doesn't make any sense.

22:53.720 --> 22:56.520
Perhaps he was trying to kill
himself, sir. Jumped.

22:56.520 --> 22:58.040
Or maybe he was pushed.

22:58.040 --> 23:01.829
In which case, how did the attacker
enter with you on the landing?

23:02.368 --> 23:03.840
Well, Sergeant?

23:05.800 --> 23:07.526
Is there another way into
the bedroom?

23:07.760 --> 23:09.040
No, Father.

23:09.040 --> 23:10.640
This is a crime scene.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.680
What the hell are you
doing back here?

23:12.680 --> 23:13.800
Just offering my help.

23:13.800 --> 23:17.080
You can help by attaching a lead
to your dog collar

23:17.080 --> 23:19.200
and taking yourself for a walk.

23:24.560 --> 23:26.234
Was Angus depressed at all?

23:27.095 --> 23:29.080
I don't believe he was trying
to kill himself.

23:29.251 --> 23:30.906
He wouldn't do that to his wife.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.160
You should keep something
of your father's.

23:37.160 --> 23:38.400
What's the point?

23:39.440 --> 23:41.606
It's the end of the troupe
now he's dead.

23:42.520 --> 23:43.680
What will you do?

23:44.800 --> 23:48.520
Go to Paris, join
the Anarchist movement.

23:50.760 --> 23:53.403
I hope they hang your husband
for what he did.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.040
While the Inspector is in the
farmhouse,

23:59.040 --> 24:01.263
let's have a look at the
outbuilding.

24:05.960 --> 24:07.520
What are you hoping to find in here?

24:07.520 --> 24:08.600
Not sure.

24:11.656 --> 24:13.909
No way in but the door.

24:14.440 --> 24:16.535
Same as Angus' bedroom. Oh.

24:18.080 --> 24:19.560
What?

24:19.560 --> 24:22.440
A drip from the roof.

24:22.994 --> 24:24.914
Went right down my back.

24:29.880 --> 24:32.040
<font color="lime">It'll just be rainwater.</font> Exactly,

24:32.040 --> 24:34.920
trickling through a crack or a gap.

24:34.920 --> 24:36.520
Climb up and have a look.

24:44.960 --> 24:46.400
Anything?

24:46.400 --> 24:47.880
There's a loose tile.

24:51.562 --> 24:54.015
It's just big enough to fit your
hand through.

24:54.912 --> 24:58.312
Are you sure you didn't hear
anything from Angus' room?

24:58.693 --> 25:00.055
No, sir.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.840
Well, let's see if he's regained
consciousness.

25:03.840 --> 25:05.160
Inspector...!

25:05.160 --> 25:06.680
Are you still here?

25:06.905 --> 25:09.640
I think I know how Lionel
was killed.

25:09.640 --> 25:12.413
He was shot through a gap
in the roof.

25:13.160 --> 25:15.800
Well, since I deal in facts,
not hunches,

25:15.800 --> 25:18.480
I'll wait for the pathologist to
confirm how close the gun was.

25:18.480 --> 25:21.602
Now stop snooping!
Last chance, Padre.

25:23.560 --> 25:24.856
We're just leaving.

25:28.240 --> 25:30.495
I need to see my father
one last time.

25:30.520 --> 25:33.885
<font color="yellow">Could you take me to the
undertakers?</font> Of course. Jump in.

25:36.560 --> 25:41.360
Tell me, who are your tears for?
Your husband?

25:43.788 --> 25:45.742
If I'm honest, I don't know.

25:46.378 --> 25:48.138
They shouldn't be for my father.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.543
He had women in every town.

25:52.982 --> 25:55.318
And he always promised them
everything.

25:58.560 --> 26:01.178
Sorry, it's just the way he was.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.280
SHE SNIFFS

26:05.280 --> 26:07.402
So did Titan even love me?

26:07.619 --> 26:09.590
Not like your husband does.

26:23.481 --> 26:28.121
POLICE BELLS RING

26:46.480 --> 26:48.480
Can you hear me, lad?

26:55.160 --> 26:56.240
Magd...

26:59.120 --> 27:00.639
Magdalena.

27:01.226 --> 27:04.880
What's that?

27:04.880 --> 27:08.314
Sh... She pushed me.

27:10.627 --> 27:11.867
Goodfellow.

27:39.520 --> 27:41.760
Burn!

27:41.760 --> 27:43.520
Burn!

27:59.720 --> 28:02.400
KNOCK AT DOOR

28:03.994 --> 28:05.223
Come in.

28:06.840 --> 28:09.480
Father, I've finally finished my
anarchy poem.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.760
Can I read it to you? Are you ready?

28:13.280 --> 28:16.160
Father, have you heard the latest?

28:16.160 --> 28:18.280
Mrs M, you're like the
Kembleford Gazette.

28:18.280 --> 28:21.760
The police think that Magdalena
is the real killer!

28:22.840 --> 28:25.362
So that's why they're all
over the village.

28:25.387 --> 28:28.347
But why would she want to kill
her own father?

29:01.313 --> 29:04.400
She can't have gone far,
I gave her a lift earlier.

29:04.400 --> 29:07.680
They've released Farmer Clegg -
insufficient evidence.

29:07.680 --> 29:09.720
I always thought he was innocent.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.400
You said you suspected him
all along.

29:11.400 --> 29:14.360
No, I never said any such thing.

29:14.360 --> 29:18.520
Mr Clegg, I'll be driving past your
farm if you need a lift.

29:18.520 --> 29:20.200
<font color="yellow">No, thank you.</font> It's no trouble.

29:20.200 --> 29:22.840
I've actually booked into a B&B.

29:22.840 --> 29:23.880
Oh, right.

29:24.772 --> 29:27.898
Things must be very
difficult right now.

29:27.923 --> 29:30.323
I do think you'll work it out with
Mrs Clegg, though.

29:30.689 --> 29:34.000
<font color="yellow">I'm not so sure.
</font>Oh, could I give you some advice?

29:35.171 --> 29:37.171
I think Mrs Clegg really loves you.

29:37.320 --> 29:40.977
<font color="yellow">Why do you say that?</font> I've seen the
way she looks at you. It's obvious.

29:41.113 --> 29:43.797
But sometimes love isn't enough.

29:44.002 --> 29:46.816
She needs excitement, spontaneity.

29:47.360 --> 29:48.560
So...

29:48.560 --> 29:50.280
..you're saying I need to change?

29:51.280 --> 29:54.365
<font color="lime">Well...</font> Why, should I?
She's the one who...

30:00.520 --> 30:03.880
Well, I'd best be on my way.
Now, you take care of yourselves.

30:06.440 --> 30:09.200
Farmer Clegg! She's going to attack!

30:09.200 --> 30:13.560
Sergeant! Sergeant, she's there!
The killer.

30:13.560 --> 30:15.400
WHISTLE BLASTS

30:21.000 --> 30:22.560
Magdalena. You're making a mistake!

30:22.560 --> 30:25.440
You pushed Angus. <font color="cyan">No...</font> ..and you
were about to attack Farmer Clegg.

30:25.440 --> 30:27.360
I was upset, he just
killed my father.

30:27.360 --> 30:29.480
She's a ruddy animal!

30:29.480 --> 30:31.600
Almonds, sir. In her bag.

30:32.920 --> 30:35.320
Titan's murder!
It's all fitting into place.

30:35.320 --> 30:36.520
I didn't put them there.

30:36.520 --> 30:38.080
Get her to the station.

30:40.320 --> 30:43.720
Inspector, how did she get into
Angus' room without being seen?

30:43.720 --> 30:46.520
Sergeant Snooze here has finally
admitted that he might have

30:46.520 --> 30:48.240
dozed off at some point.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.960
If I did, sir, it would have only
been for a few seconds.

30:50.960 --> 30:54.440
Just get to the station.
And try to stay awake this time.

30:54.440 --> 30:57.480
Thank heavens I saw her when I did.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.600
It was you who called the police?

31:01.080 --> 31:03.651
I have doubts about her guilt.

31:03.858 --> 31:05.778
She's an anarchist.

31:05.920 --> 31:08.120
Heaven only knows what goes
on in her head.

31:08.120 --> 31:11.660
I wish you'd have waited so I could
have spoken to her first.

31:11.880 --> 31:14.557
But she was going to hurt
Farmer Clegg.

31:14.705 --> 31:17.505
And anyway, they'd have caught up
with her soon enough,

31:17.560 --> 31:18.800
with her bad leg.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.040
What? What is it, Father?

31:23.040 --> 31:25.440
Mrs McCarthy, you are a genius!

32:05.840 --> 32:07.200
Angus!

32:10.760 --> 32:14.880
I went to the Cottage Hospital, but
they said you'd discharged yourself.

32:14.880 --> 32:16.680
How did you know I was here?

32:17.840 --> 32:20.160
The Glasgow train via Birmingham.

32:20.160 --> 32:23.877
I presume that's where you're going
now that your work here is done.

32:24.483 --> 32:26.163
Work?

32:26.188 --> 32:28.036
You're not an anarchist.

32:28.480 --> 32:30.900
In fact, you hate anarchists.

32:30.925 --> 32:33.045
That's why you joined the troupe...

32:33.200 --> 32:34.440
..to kill them all.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.080
You seem very sure of that, Father.

32:38.080 --> 32:41.280
Only the real murderer would've
accused an innocent person.

32:41.280 --> 32:42.725
Magdalena.

32:43.080 --> 32:44.520
With her injured leg,

32:44.520 --> 32:47.040
she could hardly even stand on a box
during the performance.

32:47.040 --> 32:48.160
What of it?

32:48.160 --> 32:51.240
She would have been incapable of
climbing up onto an outhouse...

32:51.240 --> 32:52.671
..to shoot Lionel.

32:53.015 --> 32:54.163
But you could.

33:30.198 --> 33:32.600
As to Magdalena murdering Titan,

33:32.600 --> 33:35.781
any fool could see that she
worshipped her father.

33:36.225 --> 33:40.160
And she's far too clever to have
left almonds in her own bag.

33:41.365 --> 33:43.151
You think I planted them?

33:44.065 --> 33:47.584
If Magdalena really is innocent,
then who pushed me from the window?

33:48.505 --> 33:49.745
No-one did.

33:51.040 --> 33:53.132
It must have been really
frustrating

33:53.157 --> 33:55.573
for you to know that there was one
member of the troop

33:55.598 --> 33:56.958
you hadn't murdered yet.

34:14.405 --> 34:16.938
But with trusty Sergeant Goodfellow
guarding...

34:17.440 --> 34:19.471
..you had to find another
way into her room.

34:29.429 --> 34:30.629
Whoa!

34:30.840 --> 34:32.960
But your plan to kill her failed...

34:48.906 --> 34:50.703
HE GROANS

34:56.679 --> 34:58.760
..so you accused her
of pushing you...

35:02.492 --> 35:04.378
..and framed her for murder.

35:06.080 --> 35:08.072
And my motive?

35:13.000 --> 35:16.268
What terrible thing did
the troupe do to you, Angus?

35:17.320 --> 35:18.775
Or was it to a loved one?

35:20.640 --> 35:22.480
Why would you think that?

35:22.480 --> 35:26.080
The way you talk about
your wife in Glasgow...

35:26.080 --> 35:27.560
..with such affection.

35:32.080 --> 35:33.562
Did they harm her?

35:34.671 --> 35:37.040
Or even worse,
did they take her from you?

35:41.880 --> 35:43.440
What happened?

35:45.932 --> 35:47.295
They...

35:48.120 --> 35:50.280
They performed a play in Glasgow...

35:50.280 --> 35:51.480
..about low wages.

35:54.040 --> 35:56.280
It rallied the factory workers.

35:57.400 --> 36:00.584
Fuelled their anger
and caused a riot.

36:01.295 --> 36:05.560
SHOUTING

36:12.534 --> 36:14.094
She got caught up in it?

36:17.254 --> 36:18.855
HE SIGHS SHAKILY

36:19.113 --> 36:21.305
On her way home she...

36:24.440 --> 36:26.080
She was trampled to death.

36:27.360 --> 36:29.120
SHOUTING

36:38.640 --> 36:40.240
I loved her so much, Father.

36:42.254 --> 36:43.894
I'm so sorry...

36:46.440 --> 36:49.160
..but you can't blame the anarchist
troop for what happened,

36:49.160 --> 36:51.120
they weren't directly responsible.

36:51.120 --> 36:52.520
<font color="lime">Yes, they were.</font> How?

36:52.520 --> 36:55.280
They were told beforehand
to cancel by the police.

36:55.280 --> 36:58.360
There was already civil unrest and
they feared the play's aftermath

36:58.360 --> 37:00.492
but Titan and his sidekicks
went ahead anyway.

37:09.320 --> 37:11.960
We had something special...

37:11.960 --> 37:13.200
Everyone said so.

37:14.531 --> 37:15.939
We'd grown up together.

37:18.040 --> 37:20.000
Angus.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.120
There'd never been anyone else.

37:22.120 --> 37:24.840
I know you're in pain...
It's more than that!

37:24.840 --> 37:27.737
I held her in my arms and I swore
they would never get away with it!

37:36.320 --> 37:37.151
So...

37:39.480 --> 37:42.440
..how did you join the troupe
to get your revenge?

37:42.440 --> 37:44.680
I pretended to be just like
one of them.

37:44.680 --> 37:49.600
Some deluded anarchist.
I agreed to work for nothing.

37:49.900 --> 37:52.640
I think you've become lost
in your own hatred.

37:54.280 --> 37:56.787
But it's not too late
to seek forgiveness.

37:57.360 --> 37:59.931
Save your breath,
I've never been a believer.

38:00.080 --> 38:03.048
Then how do you know
what you did was wrong?

38:03.520 --> 38:05.622
I'm not sure of anything any more.

38:06.387 --> 38:08.400
For months I've been living
and breathing revenge

38:08.400 --> 38:09.964
and, now it's over...

38:11.120 --> 38:12.690
..there's nothing left.

38:13.240 --> 38:15.319
Except hope. Not for me.

38:15.522 --> 38:16.804
Look at what I've become.

38:17.280 --> 38:19.620
I'm no different to those
who killed my wife.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.800
TRAIN APPROACHING

38:21.987 --> 38:23.520
Goodbye, Father.

38:27.451 --> 38:29.291
That's not the Glasgow train.

38:29.880 --> 38:33.680
After all the chaos,
it's time to restore some order.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.560
Angus!

38:51.440 --> 38:52.720
You should have let me die!

38:52.745 --> 38:54.890
That way is never the answer.

38:55.746 --> 38:57.752
Then what is?

38:58.400 --> 39:00.710
You don't have to be like the
people you hate.

39:01.067 --> 39:02.547
There is another way.

39:03.640 --> 39:04.815
What?

39:05.160 --> 39:07.680
Do the one thing Titan
would never do.

39:09.240 --> 39:12.463
Take responsibility for the pain
and mayhem you've caused.

39:12.580 --> 39:13.971
Be accountable.

39:14.370 --> 39:15.770
It's not too late.

39:15.880 --> 39:17.728
Tell the police everything.

39:18.640 --> 39:22.240
That is the only way,
if you want order.

39:49.200 --> 39:51.040
Daffyd, I...

40:18.920 --> 40:21.789
Thank you,
Father, for getting me off the hook.

40:22.160 --> 40:25.202
Well, I couldn't let an innocent
person go to the gallows.

40:25.720 --> 40:29.320
Is that how you really see me -
innocent?

40:29.320 --> 40:31.174
That depends.

40:31.362 --> 40:35.066
Do you feel any guilt about what
happened to Angus and his wife?

40:35.760 --> 40:38.732
Father taught me that a true
anarchist is their own master.

40:39.200 --> 40:41.691
They don't recognise duty to others.

40:42.120 --> 40:45.320
And now? Do you still believe that?

40:48.455 --> 40:49.775
I'm not sure.

40:50.676 --> 40:53.309
Anarchy was drummed into me
since I was a child...

40:53.995 --> 40:56.770
<font color="yellow">..like a religion.
</font>That you've never doubted.

40:57.515 --> 40:58.835
Exactly.

41:01.186 --> 41:03.745
Do you ever question your faith,
Father?

41:05.019 --> 41:06.507
Don't tell the Bishop.

41:07.670 --> 41:09.374
Sometimes, yes.

41:10.778 --> 41:12.274
You surprise me.

41:12.299 --> 41:17.499
Well, religion, like all belief,
should be open to enquiry.

41:17.880 --> 41:21.840
It should evolve, embrace.

41:24.640 --> 41:28.040
So, what next? Will you join
the anarchists in Paris?

41:29.800 --> 41:31.662
Don't think I'm ready for that.

41:32.857 --> 41:35.341
I think I need to take stock.

41:36.090 --> 41:37.570
Think about what matters.

41:38.355 --> 41:39.755
I think that's wise.

41:42.041 --> 41:46.001
Magdalena, I hope everything
works out for you.

42:00.859 --> 42:03.880
I'm thinking of performing it
at the Evesham Literary Festival,

42:03.880 --> 42:05.560
so please be brutally honest.

42:05.560 --> 42:08.700
Have we not had enough
of this anarchy nonsense?

42:08.725 --> 42:12.165
<font color="lime">Don't worry, Mrs M, there'll be no
mud flinging.</font> Oh, highly amusing.

42:12.422 --> 42:13.633
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

42:13.930 --> 42:16.640
<font color="lime">"Anarchy...!"</font> Oh!

42:16.640 --> 42:18.680
"Destroy the day.

42:18.680 --> 42:20.160
"Destroy the night.

42:20.160 --> 42:22.304
"Mutiny and revolt...

42:22.329 --> 42:24.729
"..rebel and fight!

42:24.920 --> 42:28.440
"Anarchy for you, anarchy for me,

42:28.440 --> 42:33.840
"until there is nothing -
nothing but darkness.

42:34.920 --> 42:40.240
"Until there is nothing -
nothing but nothing.

42:42.720 --> 42:46.360
"From thus, comes light,
glorious light."

42:50.960 --> 42:52.880
That's my type of anarchy.
