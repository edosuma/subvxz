00:02.560 --> 00:05.200
Would you want to grow up here? 
 I have to.

00:05.200 --> 00:06.600
I'm Alex Mack.

00:06.600 --> 00:11.000
I was just an average kid 
 until my first day of Junior High.

00:12.800 --> 00:16.880
One minute I'm walking home, 
 the next, there's a crash

00:16.880 --> 00:19.960
and I'm drenched 
 in some weird chemical.

00:21.120 --> 00:24.400
And since then... 
 nothing's been the same.

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

00:37.880 --> 00:40.960
My best friend Ray 
 thinks it's cool.

00:40.960 --> 00:44.160
And my sister Annie 
 thinks I'm a science project.

00:44.960 --> 00:47.800
I can't let anyone else find out.

00:47.800 --> 00:49.880
Not even my parents.

00:51.160 --> 00:54.080
I know the Chemical Plant 
 wants to find me

00:54.080 --> 00:56.000
and turn me into some experiment.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.360
But you know something?

00:57.360 --> 01:00.600
I guess I'm not so average anymore.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.480
Finally, the weekend. 
 This week took a month.

01:05.480 --> 01:06.680
Some weekend.

01:06.680 --> 01:09.680
To me, it's three chapters 
 of American history.

01:09.680 --> 01:12.760
Should I care about 
 the industrial revolution?

01:12.760 --> 01:17.120
If we don't learn from the past 
 we'll repeat the same mistakes.

01:17.120 --> 01:21.320
At least Ray got us these tickets 
 to the Ruinator II preview.

01:21.320 --> 01:25.040
Why did he give you two? 
 You going to take Annie?

01:26.280 --> 01:29.680
[Robyn] Or maybe there's 
 someone else you can take.

01:29.680 --> 01:32.800
If you've... got the guts.

01:32.800 --> 01:35.520
Can you guys leave me 
 alone for a minute?

01:35.520 --> 01:37.920
I'll meet you 
 at the movie theater.

01:37.920 --> 01:40.400
- Hi guys. 
 - [both] Hi, Scott.

01:40.400 --> 01:43.000
Hi, Alex. 
 Where's everyone going?

01:43.000 --> 01:47.440
- Um... the movies. 
 - And, uh, what are you doing?

01:47.440 --> 01:49.720
Well, I was wondering...

01:51.320 --> 01:53.760
Do you have krantz for science?

01:53.760 --> 01:55.760
[car horn honking]

01:56.400 --> 01:58.160
[Mrs Mack] 
 Alex!

02:00.560 --> 02:04.320
- Is that your mom? 
 - Yes.

02:05.120 --> 02:07.320
Alex. 
 I'm so glad I saw you.

02:07.320 --> 02:10.199
Listen, I need your help. 
 Who's that?

02:10.199 --> 02:13.080
- Scott. 
 - Are you going to introduce us?

02:13.080 --> 02:16.000
Scott, this is my mom. 
 Mom, Scott.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.400
- Hi. 
 - Nice to meet you, Scott.

02:18.400 --> 02:21.680
He's very cute. 
 Isn't he a little too old for you?

02:21.680 --> 02:25.040
- Mom! 
 - I need you to go to the store.

02:25.040 --> 02:27.240
I can't. 
 I'm going to the movies.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.600
Danielle called and 
 it's urgent I go to the Plant.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.640
You can go to the movies tomorrow.

02:32.640 --> 02:36.080
You don't understand 
 it's a special sneak preview.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.760
I'm sorry, you can't go.

02:37.760 --> 02:41.080
It's your responsibility 
 to get the groceries.

02:41.080 --> 02:44.160
I don't have time to discuss this. 
 Here's the list.

02:44.160 --> 02:46.360
I'll see you later.

02:51.080 --> 02:54.600
Do you want two free tickets 
 to the Ruinator II preview?

02:54.600 --> 02:56.760
It starts in, like, half an hour.

02:56.760 --> 02:58.240
Really? Definitely.

02:58.240 --> 03:03.160
- Uh, aren't you going to go? 
 - I wish I could, but I can't.

03:03.160 --> 03:06.360
Yeah, I really want to see this. 
 It's nice of you.

03:06.360 --> 03:09.920
Sure. 
 Have a great time.

03:10.600 --> 03:12.200
Thanks.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.120
- [liquid bubbling] 
 - Hello.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.680
- Danielle? 
 - Come in.

03:22.680 --> 03:23.440
Oh.

03:26.640 --> 03:28.640
Uh, you wanted to see me?

03:28.640 --> 03:31.240
About the board 
 of directors meeting--

03:31.240 --> 03:34.600
I don't want any confusion 
 with this plan of yours.

03:34.600 --> 03:37.440
That won't be a problem, 
 I'll be very specific.

03:37.440 --> 03:38.840
Good.

03:38.840 --> 03:42.480
Oh, I need to move the meeting up 
 to 5:00 this evening.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.120
Uh, this evening? 
 It was scheduled for Monday.

03:45.120 --> 03:48.920
I'm leaving town right after 
 the Fountain Dedication tomorrow.

03:48.920 --> 03:52.040
- Is your presentation ready? 
 - Uh, sure.

03:52.040 --> 03:54.520
I thought I'd have 
 the weekend to clean it up

03:54.520 --> 03:56.480
and I have a lot to do before...

03:56.480 --> 03:59.600
Are you ready for the meeting, 
 yes or no?

03:59.600 --> 04:03.200
Yes. I'll just go home and 
 get some additional material.

04:03.200 --> 04:04.600
See you at 5:00.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.240
Oh, and, Barbara... 
 make this one good.

04:21.880 --> 04:24.960
I cannot believe 
 you embarrassed me like that.

04:24.960 --> 04:27.560
- I didn't mean to. 
 - You didn't?

04:27.560 --> 04:29.640
You certainly did a good job.

04:29.640 --> 04:32.480
Alex... all I did 
 was ask you to do

04:32.480 --> 04:34.800
what you should have done before.

04:34.800 --> 04:38.400
Why are you always 
 treating me like a little kid?

04:38.400 --> 04:42.080
Why can't you ever 
 let me do what I want to do?

04:59.200 --> 05:00.960
[pops]

05:15.680 --> 05:16.760
[zapping]

05:28.400 --> 05:31.040
Alex, I have to go 
 back to the Plant

05:31.040 --> 05:34.240
and make a huge 
 presentation for Danielle.

05:34.240 --> 05:37.600
I don't have time for this. 
 Where's your sister?

05:37.600 --> 05:38.680
I don't know.

05:38.680 --> 05:41.280
Then you make dinner 
 for her and Daddy.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.600
What? That is not fair.

05:43.600 --> 05:47.560
You were supposed to go to 
 the store yesterday and you didn't.

05:47.560 --> 05:50.440
Maybe if you were organized 
 like I am

05:50.440 --> 05:52.440
there's be food here for them

05:52.440 --> 05:55.160
and you could have gone 
 to the movie.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.840
I'm so sorry I'm late.

06:32.840 --> 06:36.240
I promised the board 
 that you would provide us

06:36.240 --> 06:40.160
with extensive information 
 regarding your six-month plan?

06:40.160 --> 06:44.800
Yes, well, I've gone over 
 the wish list

06:44.800 --> 06:48.960
you provided me with... 
 and I think there are a, um...

06:48.960 --> 06:51.640
a number of things that we can...

06:51.640 --> 06:54.240
achieve over the next half a year.

06:54.240 --> 06:58.080
Um, here are copies 
 of the proposed plan

06:58.080 --> 07:01.240
- you've all seen before. 
 - [glass scraping]

07:01.240 --> 07:04.040
I've compiled a schedule of events

07:04.040 --> 07:08.040
that, uh... 
 I know they're here somewhere.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.320
Are you prepared 
 for this meeting, Barbara?

07:11.320 --> 07:15.600
Yes. Of course I am. 
 Uh, here they are.

07:15.600 --> 07:19.080
As you can see 
 after the Fountain Dedication

07:19.080 --> 07:22.000
the next big event 
 that I have scheduled

07:22.000 --> 07:23.840
is a ribbon-cutting ceremony

07:23.840 --> 07:27.480
at the Paradise Valley 
 Museum of Art on the Fifth.

07:27.480 --> 07:31.560
I'm out of town on the Fifth. 
 Is there an alternate date?

07:31.560 --> 07:35.640
Yes. Just let me look.

07:47.320 --> 07:50.680
- What are you doing? 
 - What does it look like I'm doing?

07:50.680 --> 07:53.600
Can you believe I have 
 to make dinner tonight?

07:53.600 --> 07:55.160
For who?

07:55.160 --> 07:58.840
Dad and I have the meeting 
 at the Einstein Society.

07:58.840 --> 08:01.400
We'll grab sandwiches 
 on the way back.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.960
Hi, Alex.

08:02.960 --> 08:06.120
Annie, we're leaving in about 
 20 minutes, so get ready.

08:06.360 --> 08:07.640
Okay.

08:07.640 --> 08:10.160
You're not staying for dinner?

08:10.160 --> 08:11.880
What's the big deal? 
 Stop cooking.

08:11.880 --> 08:14.480
I could have gone 
 to the movies with Scott.

08:14.480 --> 08:16.960
But Mom said I had 
 to cook for you guys.

08:16.960 --> 08:20.080
Don't be angry. 
 Mom's under a lot of stress at work.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.560
So what?! 
 She loves stress.

08:22.560 --> 08:27.320
Danielle, I don't know what to say.

08:27.320 --> 08:30.240
That's okay. I do.

08:30.240 --> 08:32.760
That was the most 
 disgraceful performance

08:32.760 --> 08:35.799
by anyone in my employ 
 that I have ever witnessed.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.880
Do you know who those people are?

08:37.880 --> 08:40.720
Those are the people 
 that I have to answer to

08:40.720 --> 08:43.240
and you made me look 
 like a total idiot!

08:43.240 --> 08:46.280
I'm the one who looks 
 like an idiot, not you.

08:46.280 --> 08:47.800
Nobody cares how you look.

08:47.800 --> 08:51.400
Under normal circumstances, 
 I would fire you immediately.

08:51.400 --> 08:55.160
However... this dedication 
 must go off without a hitch

08:55.160 --> 08:58.800
and it's too late to find 
 someone else to manage it.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.440
After that, we'll discuss your future

09:01.440 --> 09:05.520
and your firm's future 
 in representing this plant.

09:09.800 --> 09:13.080
- [knocking at door] 
 - [Mr Mack] Alex, are you in there?

09:13.080 --> 09:15.400
- Alex! 
 - What?

09:15.400 --> 09:17.760
Are you okay?

09:17.760 --> 09:20.640
I'm sorry things got confused tonight.

09:20.640 --> 09:22.920
Well, we're about to take off.

09:22.920 --> 09:27.120
And there's somebody 
 downstairs who wants to see you.

09:27.120 --> 09:28.560
A boy.

09:28.560 --> 09:33.160
I think he said 
 his name is, um, Scott?

09:38.880 --> 09:39.640
Hi.

09:41.760 --> 09:45.960
Um, I wanted to come over and 
 thank you again for those tickets.

09:45.960 --> 09:47.640
It was pretty awesome.

09:47.640 --> 09:50.240
Did you go with Jessica?

09:50.520 --> 09:53.840
Yeah, but to tell you the truth, 
 I think she hated it.

09:53.840 --> 09:56.760
I'm having a pool party 
 at my place tomorrow.

09:56.760 --> 10:01.680
- I was wondering if you could come. 
 - Tomorrow? Sure.

10:01.680 --> 10:04.920
Your mom won't have 
 anything else for you to do?

10:04.920 --> 10:08.760
Definitely not. 
 After today, she owes me big.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.520
Great. 
 Then I'll see you around 2:00

10:11.520 --> 10:14.200
and you can bring 
 anyone you want.

10:15.160 --> 10:18.240
Great, I'll, uh, see you then.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.640
[Mr Mack] 
 We're taking off, Alex. Bye.

10:23.640 --> 10:25.360
Hi, honey.

10:25.880 --> 10:29.800
Barbara, are you okay?

10:31.840 --> 10:34.800
- Tell us what's the matter. 
 - I don't know.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.360
First I'm late for 
 a crucial presentation

10:37.360 --> 10:41.240
to the board of directors at 
 the Plant and I open up the file

10:41.240 --> 10:44.200
and all of my work 
 is completely disorganized.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.840
I was humiliated, George.

10:46.840 --> 10:50.160
- Danielle? 
 - Danielle's this close to firing me.

10:50.160 --> 10:52.720
- Oh, it was horrible. 
 - [Mr Mack] Well, that's terrible.

10:52.720 --> 10:55.960
Do you want us to stay home 
 from the meeting?

10:55.960 --> 10:59.800
The Einstein meeting? 
 Oh, I forgot all about that.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.560
Oh, George, no, go, honey.

11:02.560 --> 11:04.280
Alex.

11:05.200 --> 11:05.960
Oh.

11:07.720 --> 11:11.400
I owe you a big apology, don't I?

11:11.400 --> 11:14.120
- No, you don't. 
 - Yes, I do.

11:14.120 --> 11:17.920
I guess I can be disorganized, too.

11:17.920 --> 11:20.640
I'm sorry for the way 
 I spoke to you before.

11:20.640 --> 11:24.200
I made you miss 
 your special movie, didn't I?

11:24.200 --> 11:25.920
It's okay, Mom.

11:25.920 --> 11:28.800
- It is? 
 - Yeah.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.240
No problem.

11:31.240 --> 11:34.400
I can see that movie anytime.

11:44.040 --> 11:45.360
I don't get it, Alex.

11:45.360 --> 11:49.400
You're going to a party at Scott's 
 and you're walking around here

11:49.400 --> 11:53.920
like you just found your pet goldfish 
 floating at the top of the bowl.

11:53.920 --> 11:55.560
Yeah.

11:55.560 --> 11:58.080
You know what happened 
 to Mom yesterday?

11:58.080 --> 12:01.720
It was my fault. She kept me 
 from going to the movies

12:01.720 --> 12:05.800
and told me how disorganized I was. 
 So I kind of disorganized her.

12:05.800 --> 12:09.160
Let me guess, you used 
 your little powers to do it.

12:09.160 --> 12:15.000
I didn't know I'd get her into 
 trouble and I feel really lousy.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.560
- Promise you won't tell? 
 - I won't.

12:17.560 --> 12:22.080
It was an immature thing to do 
 but I know how she can be sometimes.

12:28.800 --> 12:31.240
How do I look?

12:33.400 --> 12:37.040
I'll look for you in 
 next season's swimsuit issue.

12:38.160 --> 12:40.800
- [Mr Mack] What? 
 - The Caterers canceled on me.

12:40.800 --> 12:44.640
They booked too many jobs 
 for today and they can't make it.

12:44.640 --> 12:48.160
They also hinted they have 
 worked for Danielle before

12:48.160 --> 12:50.960
and they're not crazy 
 about doing it again.

12:50.960 --> 12:52.480
Can't you replace them?

12:52.480 --> 12:55.240
It's impossible, 
 it's Saturday afternoon.

12:55.240 --> 12:56.520
I can't believe it!

12:56.520 --> 13:00.440
The food is sitting there and 
 there's nobody there to serve it!

13:00.440 --> 13:05.360
- Do you have a plan B? 
 - Not yet I don't.

13:20.120 --> 13:23.040
Nicole, that is 
 the biggest hat I've ever seen.

13:23.040 --> 13:26.240
You know what they say 
 about ozone depletion.

13:26.240 --> 13:28.960
Any exposure to the sun 
 whatsoever is dangerous.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.480
I'm just being careful.

13:30.480 --> 13:34.160
It's true, 20 minutes of sun 
 equals a week in the hospital.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.080
- Hey, what's up? 
 - [both] Hi.

13:37.080 --> 13:40.120
- Hi. 
 - I'm glad you made it.

13:40.120 --> 13:42.480
We're about to get 
 a water polo game.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.240
Water polo? Cool.

13:47.520 --> 13:51.160
- What are you so excited about? 
 - I don't know.

13:51.160 --> 13:55.360
Water polo seems like a game 
 that I could be pretty good at.

13:56.680 --> 14:00.680
- [door bell rings] 
 - Annie, could you get the door?

14:00.680 --> 14:03.280
I just need a few people, really.

14:03.280 --> 14:05.400
I know it's short notice.

14:05.400 --> 14:10.880
- I understand. 
 - Mom... Mom, Danielle Atron's here.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.880
Can I call you back?

14:15.200 --> 14:19.200
Danielle, would you like to come in?

14:19.200 --> 14:21.800
No, I was just on my way 
 to the Funraiser

14:21.800 --> 14:24.800
and I thought it might 
 be a good idea to stop by

14:24.800 --> 14:27.160
and make sure 
 things were going well.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.280
Fine, no problems.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.680
Good, because I'd hate 
 to think how a failure today

14:32.680 --> 14:35.120
might affect 
 your employment future.

14:35.120 --> 14:39.240
- I understand. 
 - I'll see you later.

14:44.680 --> 14:49.960
[boy] Hey, give me the ball, 
 man, give me the ball.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.160
[splashing and yelling]

14:55.640 --> 14:56.720
Get open!

15:12.200 --> 15:14.400
Over here, I'm open!

15:18.800 --> 15:21.280
[cheering]

15:24.840 --> 15:27.560
Great shot, 
 that was pretty amazing, Alex.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.400
You just disappeared on me.

15:29.400 --> 15:32.360
I'm very quick-- 
 can't take your eyes off me.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.080
I guess not.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.360
Annie, what are you doing here?

15:43.360 --> 15:45.320
We need to talk.

15:47.040 --> 15:49.640
But I'm having 
 such a fun time here.

15:49.640 --> 15:52.080
But don't you think you owe her?

15:59.120 --> 16:01.320
Ouch, ouch!

16:02.360 --> 16:05.600
The guests will be here 
 in less than an hour

16:05.600 --> 16:08.240
and the Caterers 
 aren't even here yet?

16:08.240 --> 16:10.600
I needed to talk to you about that.

16:10.600 --> 16:14.760
I thought you said you had 
 everything under control, Barbara.

16:14.760 --> 16:18.840
I know, but we have a problem, 
 and, and the problem is

16:18.840 --> 16:20.960
that the Caterers...

16:25.360 --> 16:28.720
Are ususually short.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.520
Um, isn't that your third?

16:36.520 --> 16:40.240
I guess we know who's not 
 the designated driver tonight.

16:40.240 --> 16:43.680
How about a nice glass 
 of sparkling cider instead?

16:43.680 --> 16:45.640
You know, 
 instead of giving money

16:45.640 --> 16:48.280
to a corporation 
 that has more than enough

16:48.280 --> 16:50.760
I know a few more 
 earth-friendly causes

16:50.760 --> 16:52.760
you might consider donating to.

16:52.760 --> 16:55.760
- All tax-deductible, of course. 
 - Excuse us.

16:55.760 --> 17:00.840
I'm sorry, Ms. Mack. 
 Did I say something wrong?

17:00.840 --> 17:03.400
Whoa, just a sec, 
 um, Alex is changing.

17:03.400 --> 17:05.319
Changing into what?

17:42.280 --> 17:44.440
Come on, look, Annie, 
 we've got people waiting.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.160
You guys got to move 
 faster than that.

17:48.160 --> 17:50.600
I'm getting all backed up in here.

17:54.120 --> 17:56.240
[satisfied sigh]

18:01.880 --> 18:04.920
[Mrs Mack] 
 This speech thing is supposed to be...

18:04.920 --> 18:08.040
- you told me it was going... 
 - I'm not... I didn't...

18:08.040 --> 18:11.400
Okay, listen, just go over 
 and take care of it, please.

18:11.400 --> 18:13.720
Mom, can I talk to you 
 for a minute.

18:13.720 --> 18:17.240
Oh, not now, honey, this is 
 the worst possible time.

18:17.240 --> 18:18.480
What's the matter?

18:18.480 --> 18:21.360
The fountain, 
 they were unable to plumb it.

18:21.360 --> 18:24.800
There's no water. 
 Something about lack of pressure.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.200
I have to go tell Danielle.

18:31.960 --> 18:33.400
Danielle?

18:33.400 --> 18:36.720
What is it, Barbara? 
 I'm about to make my speech.

18:36.720 --> 18:40.040
Sorry, there's slight glitch 
 with the fountain.

18:40.040 --> 18:42.120
Um, they couldn't plumb it.

18:42.120 --> 18:45.280
You assured me this 
 would be a complete display.

18:45.280 --> 18:47.880
Did you not? 
 That's what they told me.

18:47.880 --> 18:50.800
Danielle, I think 
 it's a beautiful fountain.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.840
As if what you think matters.

18:52.840 --> 18:56.680
Consider this your final 
 assignment for me, Barbara.

18:56.680 --> 19:00.240
Fine. Excuse me.

19:00.240 --> 19:05.000
I have to go dedicate this 
 spectacular dry fountain.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.920
[applause]

19:18.120 --> 19:19.480
Ladies and gentlemen...

19:19.480 --> 19:21.640
My mom helped design 
 this fountain.

19:21.640 --> 19:25.200
- Wow. 
 - I'm so pleased you could join me

19:25.200 --> 19:28.080
for the dedication 
 of this beautiful monument.

19:28.080 --> 19:32.360
With your help, I was able 
 to build this gorgeous fountain

19:32.360 --> 19:34.920
as a loving tribute 
 to my beloved father

19:34.920 --> 19:40.160
and it is with your further pledges 
 that Paradise Valley Chemical

19:40.160 --> 19:43.280
will be able to continue 
 its great works

19:43.280 --> 19:47.520
not only for Paradise Valley, 
 but for the world at large.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.120
Thank you.

20:04.920 --> 20:06.120
[applause]

20:19.720 --> 20:22.880
Wow, your mom's good.

20:33.680 --> 20:36.480
[Danielle] Barbara, 
 I've been looking for you.

20:36.480 --> 20:40.080
I hope you'll forget 
 everything I said before.

20:40.080 --> 20:42.400
I was just a little nervous.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.520
Actually, I think it might be time

20:44.520 --> 20:47.760
for you to take on a 
 new account rep, Danielle.

20:47.760 --> 20:51.840
I have other clients who are far 
 more appreciative of my work.

20:51.840 --> 20:54.120
If it's your fee that's a problem...

20:54.120 --> 20:57.560
My fee also happens to be 
 a problem but you know what?

20:57.560 --> 21:00.280
This is not the right time 
 to discuss it.

21:07.640 --> 21:10.040
Alex, you really helped me out today.

21:10.040 --> 21:13.240
- Thank you so much. 
 - I had to, Mom.

21:13.240 --> 21:18.000
- This whole mess was my fault. 
 - What do you mean, sweetie?

21:18.000 --> 21:22.800
See, yesterday I was so angry 
 that you called me disorganized

21:22.800 --> 21:26.600
- that I disorganized your files. 
 - Excuse me? You did that?

21:26.600 --> 21:30.720
I didn't know it was going 
 to turn into such a big mess.

21:30.720 --> 21:34.040
I was mad at you for 
 making me miss my movie.

21:34.040 --> 21:38.080
Alex, do you realize I almost 
 lost my job because of you?

21:38.080 --> 21:39.440
I know, I was wrong.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.920
You don't understand 
 what it's like

21:41.920 --> 21:45.080
not being able to make 
 your own decisions--

21:45.080 --> 21:47.640
Always having somebody 
 boss you around.

21:47.640 --> 21:50.880
I do understand. 
 I work for Danielle, remember?

21:50.880 --> 21:54.200
I wish you could tell her 
 what you really think.

21:54.200 --> 21:58.920
Sometimes, not often, you just 
 can't tell people the whole truth.

21:58.920 --> 22:00.960
[Scott] 
 Hey, Alex!

22:02.040 --> 22:04.080
Yeah, I know.

22:04.360 --> 22:08.000
- Go on. 
 - I really sorry, Mom.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.680
It's okay, we're even.

22:14.720 --> 22:15.470
Go.

22:23.320 --> 22:26.200
I guess I'm going to 
 have to get used to Alex

22:26.200 --> 22:28.880
- having her own life. 
 - Yeah, it happens.

22:28.880 --> 22:32.520
One day you both are going 
 to leave go off and get married

22:32.520 --> 22:36.160
and maybe if I'm very lucky 
 I'll get to see you on holidays.

22:36.400 --> 22:39.040
Why don't you just take it 
 one day at a time?

22:39.040 --> 22:42.320
Hey, that's a good idea. 
 When did you get so smart?

22:42.320 --> 22:44.280
Sorry I cleared out your party.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.440
Who cares? 
 This was a lot of fun

22:46.440 --> 22:50.560
- especially when your mom paid us. 
 - I couldn't take the money.

22:50.560 --> 22:52.120
I owed her.

22:52.120 --> 22:55.600
- I thought you said she owed you. 
 - Oh, it gets confusing.

22:55.600 --> 22:59.480
Well, I think I owe you. 
 How about I treat you to the movies?

22:59.480 --> 23:02.920
- Maybe Ruinator II. 
 - But you've already seen that.

23:02.920 --> 23:06.840
Yeah, but it would be nice with 
 somebody who appreciates it.

23:06.840 --> 23:08.640
Come on.
