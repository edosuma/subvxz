WEBVTT

00:07.787 --> 00:09.959
You want some more eggs, beemo?

00:10.027 --> 00:13.906
- Yes, please.
- How about you, finny?

00:13.973 --> 00:16.312
- Need a refill?
- I'm pretty full, man,

00:16.381 --> 00:19.624
but let me see if I can...
Rearrange.

00:19.692 --> 00:21.898
- Nope. Can't do it.
- I don't know if

00:21.999 --> 00:24.306
- stomachs work like that, dude.
- Sometimes it helps.

00:24.407 --> 00:28.820
Can't argue with that.
Eee, eee! Ahh.

00:28.888 --> 00:33.636
Ahh. Ahh.

00:33.704 --> 00:40.056
Ohh.

00:40.124 --> 00:44.102
Hello. Lady, it's gonna be fine.

00:44.169 --> 00:47.212
Mm-hmm. All right,
I love you, too.

00:47.281 --> 00:49.887
- Bye.
- Lady rainicorn again?

00:49.956 --> 00:52.229
Yeah, man. She's worried
about introducing

00:52.297 --> 00:53.967
me to her parents
at lunch today.

00:54.035 --> 00:55.973
She thinks they're
gonna "freak out."

00:56.075 --> 00:58.783
Um... Maybe give her
parents some treasure?

00:58.850 --> 01:00.957
No way! That's our treasure!

01:01.024 --> 01:04.467
Wait. I've got it, dude!
I'll invite them over early,

01:04.535 --> 01:07.544
"smoove" them over using my
personality, and we'll all be

01:07.645 --> 01:10.988
best friends before lady gets
here so she doesn't have to feel

01:11.055 --> 01:12.728
nervous. It's perfect.

01:12.795 --> 01:14.834
I'll just send them
a quick prism-gram.

01:14.935 --> 01:16.773
Mm-hmm.

01:23.664 --> 01:25.635
- What's it say?
- Hold on.

01:25.703 --> 01:29.080
Still converting the light
waves into brain waves.

01:29.147 --> 01:31.954
Aaaah. They're into it, dude!

01:32.057 --> 01:34.764
Sweet! Let's go
powder our noses!

01:34.865 --> 01:37.841
- Why's lady so nervous, anyway?
- Well, she didn't really

01:37.909 --> 01:40.783
say, but it might have something
to do with the rainicorn/dog

01:40.851 --> 01:42.824
- wars.
- There were wars between

01:42.890 --> 01:45.197
- rainicorns and dogs?
- Horrifying wars.

01:45.264 --> 01:47.839
For thousands of years,
rainicorns battled dogs over

01:47.906 --> 01:49.879
territory in the
crystal dimension.

01:49.947 --> 01:52.085
- But lady and I are cool.
- Dude!

01:52.154 --> 01:54.594
Her parents are probably all
full of dog hatred from the war

01:54.695 --> 01:56.501
times! They're gonna
see you're a dog

01:56.568 --> 01:59.308
and forbid lady from ever
hanging out with you again!

01:59.377 --> 02:01.582
Nah. That could never happen.

02:01.651 --> 02:03.356
You didn't think
this through enough.

02:03.457 --> 02:05.963
- It could happen!
- Waaah!

02:06.064 --> 02:08.170
- I'm a moron!
- Don't worry.

02:08.238 --> 02:10.377
I've got a plan that's
gonna solve this biz.

02:10.479 --> 02:13.889
- Homeys help homeys. Always.
- I'm ready to hear your

02:13.957 --> 02:17.033

painting ourselves rainbow color
using condiments and stuff from

02:46.796 --> 02:49.938
the fridge so we could pretend
to be rainicorns was a good idea

02:50.005 --> 02:53.449

gonna clean this

place up, and then...

03:01.944 --> 03:03.514
Jake?

03:03.582 --> 03:05.654
Aah! Let's hide and
burn the house

03:05.756 --> 03:09.333
down!

03:09.401 --> 03:12.009
- Hello?
- Annyong.

Haseyo. Jake, is that you?

03:14.183 --> 03:17.024
Uh-huh. Are you
going to let us in?

03:17.092 --> 03:21.906
Yeah. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!

03:21.974 --> 03:23.946
Aah! I can explain!

03:24.014 --> 03:26.053
I can explain! Ohh!

03:26.120 --> 03:28.996
He's so handsome! Oh, Bob!

03:29.064 --> 03:32.340
Our daughter's finally found a
handsome rainicorn to love.

03:32.442 --> 03:34.246
You think I'm a rainicorn?

03:34.314 --> 03:36.988
I think we could spot a member
of our own species, Jake.

03:37.056 --> 03:40.199
We're not blind. Well,
we are a little blind.

03:40.266 --> 03:43.141
Yes, I guess we are
a little blind.

03:43.243 --> 03:46.017
Uh... Well, hey, come on in!

03:46.119 --> 03:48.726
It's awesome to finally
meet you both.

03:48.794 --> 03:53.141
- Your house is very colorful.
- Ha!

03:53.208 --> 03:56.416
The plan is working, homey.
Jake, what is that thing

03:56.484 --> 03:59.426
- that's talking?
- Uh... That's, um...

03:59.528 --> 04:01.266
I'm Jake's rainicorn roommate.

you like, Ethel, Bob. I
am a little curious about

04:44.237 --> 04:46.577
your goblin. He
looks a little odd.

04:46.645 --> 04:48.951
Well, he's actually a human.

Oh, Bob! Our future

You all should go first, though.
Mm. Bold move letting your

I respect that.

05:33.127 --> 05:35.902

07:55.148 --> 07:57.722
We're pooped. Yeah,
we're about ready to

07:57.823 --> 08:00.030
break out our picnic
basket and dig in.

08:00.097 --> 08:02.337
Whoa, no. You're my guests.

08:02.405 --> 08:06.249
Let me take care of you.
Homey, help me cook something,

08:06.317 --> 08:08.656
- please.
- Okay.

08:08.725 --> 08:12.369
Thanks, Finn. Okay. Don't
worry about a thing.

08:12.437 --> 08:16.482
Finn'll make a great lunch.
He's a little raw, but he's got

08:16.583 --> 08:18.656
great taste. What?

08:18.757 --> 08:22.066
Wow! So wealthy <i> and</i> so generous!

08:22.134 --> 08:24.507
Oh, I was hoping, but
I was afraid to ask.

08:24.575 --> 08:27.417
Whoa. I can't wait.

08:27.485 --> 08:30.226
- Oh, I can't wait.

want to eat me!

08:49.756 --> 08:53.200
I said stop! Raaaaaah!

08:53.267 --> 08:56.242
Now, that's enough!
Nobody's eating Finn!

08:56.310 --> 08:58.817
He's not my Butler,
and he's not food!

08:58.885 --> 09:01.961
Finn is my friend!

get so far out of hand.

09:04.470 --> 09:06.475

of losing lady.

before, but they say you can't

even tell the difference.
