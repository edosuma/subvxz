WEBVTT

00:01.436 --> 00:02.504
Millie was right.

00:02.539 --> 00:05.848
Alex Dupre is the perfect choice
to be the face of the new campaign.

00:05.883 --> 00:08.019
You do know that's Brooke's boyfriend, right?

00:08.054 --> 00:10.900
- She dates a PA?
- He's not a PA, he is a producer.

00:11.872 --> 00:13.500
I know what you're thinking.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.295
But I know a good script when I read it.

00:15.550 --> 00:17.353
Ok. I'll take a look.

00:17.726 --> 00:20.299
Quinn, what happened
between you and David?

00:20.737 --> 00:23.293
He used to see the world exactly the way I saw it.

00:23.714 --> 00:25.149
He just doesn't anymore.

00:25.343 --> 00:27.129
You're gonna have to talk to me sometime.

00:27.164 --> 00:29.624
There's a girl who's threatening to
file a paternity suit against me,

00:29.659 --> 00:32.198
unless I pay her a couple hundred
thousands dollars to keep her quiet.

00:32.427 --> 00:35.105
- What are you gonna do about it?
- I don't know.

00:35.438 --> 00:37.066
What are you gonna do about it?

00:37.828 --> 00:38.844
Nothing.

00:39.186 --> 00:41.882
The amount we're willing to pay to make this go away.

00:42.277 --> 00:43.292
It's empty.

00:43.327 --> 00:47.031
It's empty because you're a lying bitch
and we're not paying you a dime.

00:47.760 --> 00:50.614
One Tree Hill - Season 7 Episode 4
Believe Me, I'm Lying

00:57.524 --> 00:59.170
You missed another workout.

00:59.652 --> 01:01.070
It's four in a row.

01:02.647 --> 01:03.936
Should I be worried?

01:04.818 --> 01:06.218
I haven't been in the mood.

01:06.253 --> 01:08.871
Look, I get that, but you can't
lose sight of what's in the line.

01:09.248 --> 01:11.869
Right now, your job is to stay in shape.

01:12.467 --> 01:15.168
Am I gonna have a job, this year?

01:16.384 --> 01:19.539
- What's going on with my contract, Clay?
- I'm working on it.

01:19.574 --> 01:23.477
- Should I be worried?
- We're gonna get it done. I promise you that.

01:25.487 --> 01:27.116
Why haven't we heard anything?

01:27.951 --> 01:29.928
I told you, man, things are in process.

01:29.963 --> 01:31.823
I'm not talking about my deal.

01:31.858 --> 01:33.652
This girl, Renee...

01:34.013 --> 01:36.838
It's been three days since we told her
we won't gonna pay her anything.

01:37.714 --> 01:39.363
You think she decided to back off?

01:39.398 --> 01:40.652
I doubt it.

01:41.611 --> 01:42.992
Don't come out.

01:43.333 --> 01:45.065
And we're prepared for that.

01:45.100 --> 01:49.085
But until then, you can't just sit around
holding your breath until it happens.

01:49.405 --> 01:52.003
Alright? I need you to get your
head back in the game, Nate.

01:55.796 --> 01:57.116
Alright?

01:58.982 --> 02:00.199
Ok.

02:00.992 --> 02:02.229
Let's go.

02:06.951 --> 02:09.900
Dude, good find! I love this stuff.

02:10.446 --> 02:13.487
Here's my official cereal selecter. Say that 3 times fast.

02:13.522 --> 02:15.920
Cereal Selecter. Cereal Selecter. Cereal Selecter.

02:15.955 --> 02:16.941
Nice.

02:16.976 --> 02:19.806
- This has too much sugar. Keep working.
- I knew it.

02:20.601 --> 02:22.168
Too much sugar?

02:22.203 --> 02:25.281
Ok, I've seen you eat 5 balls
of Count Chocula in one sitting.

02:25.316 --> 02:28.291
That was on a dare from Taylor, and before I became a mom.

02:28.326 --> 02:30.322
You'll see, you're gonna have kids some day.

02:30.357 --> 02:32.436
Dude, hand over that crystal ball.

02:32.471 --> 02:34.415
I have a few questions for it.

02:34.673 --> 02:36.704
You know, I have a question too.

02:36.739 --> 02:39.982
What happened with you and
David at Tric? It's been a few days.

02:40.693 --> 02:44.680
He wants me to come home and I told him
I need more time to figure things out.

02:47.415 --> 02:48.982
Now we're talking.

02:49.017 --> 02:51.611
Too healthy. Keep looking. It's out there.

02:54.137 --> 02:57.766
For your information, these cereals
have everything you need.

02:58.075 --> 03:00.920
That's the thing, I might have everything that I need

03:01.137 --> 03:03.398
that doesn't mean that's everything that I want.

03:11.662 --> 03:13.209
What is that smell?

03:13.446 --> 03:15.157
That would be sandalwood.

03:15.192 --> 03:17.240
Seriously, with the incense?

03:17.275 --> 03:18.813
It's relaxing.

03:18.848 --> 03:20.910
It's giving me a headache.

03:21.539 --> 03:24.497
Sorry. Are you nervous about your big day?

03:24.532 --> 03:27.850
If you're referring to the fashion show that we've
poured too much time and money into,

03:27.885 --> 03:28.956
then, yeah.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.592
I'm not gonna lie, I'm nervous about it.

03:32.147 --> 03:35.054
Well, you shouldn't be. You're Brooke Davis.

03:35.271 --> 03:38.513
You're starting to sound like
Victoria, and that's weird for me.

03:41.168 --> 03:42.689
Do you have a new script?

03:42.724 --> 03:46.013
Oh, that's the script Alex gave me the other
night. I was just writing down some ideas.

03:46.048 --> 03:48.405
- I thought you didn't like it.
- I don't.

03:48.440 --> 03:51.302
But the story's pretty good. There might be something there.

03:51.337 --> 03:54.137
Well, you don't have to do
this for me. I don't even like Alex.

03:54.456 --> 03:56.508
Oh, I'm not doing it as a favor.

03:56.543 --> 03:58.721
I know a good idea when I see one.

03:59.034 --> 04:03.858
Besides, people love a comeback story, and Alex
is a good actress when she finds the right role.

04:03.893 --> 04:06.013
So, it's worth a look.

04:06.229 --> 04:07.446
Ok.

04:11.374 --> 04:12.611
I'll see you later.

04:15.467 --> 04:17.012
Hey, Brooke Davis...

04:18.363 --> 04:20.053
you look beautiful today.

04:22.000 --> 04:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:30.310 --> 04:32.579
Please be awake, please be awake.

04:35.135 --> 04:36.393
Alex!

04:36.774 --> 04:38.680
- You're... ready.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.288
We have a job to do, don't we?

04:40.475 --> 04:41.609
Yes, we do.

04:41.644 --> 04:44.104
It's called "being professional"
which I'm kinda known for it.

04:44.139 --> 04:47.084
Used to be. Oh, my God,
you look hot by the way.

04:47.119 --> 04:50.022
Now tell me I look hot too bitch, because I do.

04:50.383 --> 04:53.393
- You look hot too, bitch.
- Thanks.

05:03.238 --> 05:04.414
Ok, right.

05:04.449 --> 05:07.269
Even though it's incredibly riventing
watching you lift weights,

05:07.304 --> 05:09.341
I think I'm gonna head out.

05:09.376 --> 05:11.444
What time do you go to the fashion show tonight?

05:11.939 --> 05:15.156
I don't know. Whatever. You going?

05:15.908 --> 05:19.606
Do I really want to watch a group
of hot models parade on stage?

05:19.908 --> 05:21.513
Getting early, buddy.

05:22.001 --> 05:24.465
You're doing good, Nate.
It's about 20?

05:24.500 --> 05:25.579
I'm at 27.

05:25.614 --> 05:28.857
You know, you don't bring the bar on your
chest every time, we don't count those.

05:30.434 --> 05:31.756
I'm watching you.

05:32.300 --> 05:33.393
Hello?

05:37.269 --> 05:38.321
Ok.

05:39.001 --> 05:41.080
Yeah, we knew there was a chance of that.

05:41.115 --> 05:42.207
Thank you.

05:45.125 --> 05:47.549
I don't care what you say. That was 30. I'm done.

05:49.682 --> 05:51.192
The story burn out, Nate.

05:54.414 --> 05:55.960
It's out there.

05:57.244 --> 05:58.460
Where?

05:59.615 --> 06:01.223
What you got there, little man?

06:02.883 --> 06:04.615
What's a love child?

06:24.767 --> 06:27.613
I bought every copy I could find.

06:28.190 --> 06:29.654
I'm sorry, Hales.

06:29.870 --> 06:32.633
- You don't have to keep apologize.
- Yes, I do.

06:33.582 --> 06:37.355
I'm responsible for this family and it
kills me that you have to go through this.

06:37.602 --> 06:40.345
We are going through this, Nathan, together.

06:41.520 --> 06:43.392
We knew this was gonna happen. We made a choice

06:43.427 --> 06:46.028
and I still think it was the right thing to do.

06:48.984 --> 06:50.468
Has Jamie seen this?

06:50.912 --> 06:52.829
He was the one that found it.

06:53.128 --> 06:56.716
He's just such a good boy. He doesn't understand
why somebody would lie like this.

06:58.272 --> 06:59.571
Is he home?

06:59.879 --> 07:02.505
No, he went to the park with Quinn.

07:03.581 --> 07:06.717
I thought it'd be good for him to spend
some time with his friends right now.

07:07.021 --> 07:11.421
"The first time we were together, Nathan
couldn't get enough, and neither could I."

07:11.887 --> 07:15.513
- Naughty naughty!
- Shut up, Chuck, it's not true.

07:15.707 --> 07:19.608
Yeah, right. My mom says they don't put
stuff in these magazines unless it's true.

07:19.735 --> 07:21.841
- Your dad's hosed.
- He is not.

07:21.842 --> 07:23.532
Yeah.

07:24.230 --> 07:27.990
I think I should be allowed enough
time to figure out exactly what I want.

07:28.776 --> 07:31.432
- I mean, don't I deserve that?
- Yeah.

07:33.078 --> 07:36.678
But David doesn't see it that way,
he just wants to work it out.

07:37.505 --> 07:40.857
What if I don't want to work it out? What if I can't?

07:41.413 --> 07:42.813
Then what?

07:43.261 --> 07:44.418
Boys...

07:53.182 --> 07:54.702
Refresh my memory.

07:54.902 --> 07:57.521
Did I not asked you to look into
the Nathan Scott situation

07:57.522 --> 07:59.194
and find out if there was a story?

07:59.195 --> 08:00.995
I did, but there wasn't.

08:01.880 --> 08:04.238
The why does the National Informer have one?

08:04.787 --> 08:07.680
The National Informer? Are you being serious?

08:08.805 --> 08:11.605
Oh oh, look at this: alien babies on the rise.

08:11.831 --> 08:14.828
They scooped us on that one too,
maybe you should hire them.

08:15.124 --> 08:16.252
Maybe I will.

08:16.253 --> 08:18.299
Come on, Charlie, this isn't news.

08:18.300 --> 08:20.995
Right now it's nothing but a
rumor in some low-rent tabloid.

08:20.996 --> 08:24.466
But as soon as we report on that,
we validate it. It becomes news.

08:24.836 --> 08:27.486
It's not fair and it's not what I do.

08:28.085 --> 08:30.695
What you do is what I tell you to do.

08:30.696 --> 08:33.885
Or else you can go drag the ratings
down at someone else's station.

08:42.417 --> 08:45.791
Quinn did a really great job with
these, Alex looks beautiful.

08:45.792 --> 08:47.512
Yeah, now all we have to do is pick one.

08:47.513 --> 08:49.166
The winner goes in tonight gift bag.

08:49.167 --> 08:50.679
So which one's the winner?

08:51.093 --> 08:53.339
- I was kind of hoping you'd pick.
- Millie...

08:53.340 --> 08:55.609
this is your decision and I want you to make it.

08:55.610 --> 08:56.781
You're good at it.

08:56.989 --> 08:59.955
Ok. That's go... this one.

09:00.698 --> 09:01.899
Perfect.

09:03.053 --> 09:07.845
Ok. Millie, even though you are completely
in charge of tonight's fashion show

09:08.008 --> 09:10.885
I decided to bring in a little experience just to help

09:10.886 --> 09:12.786
everything runs smoothly.

09:12.862 --> 09:15.165
- Please don't freak out.
- Please don't tell me you invited...

09:15.166 --> 09:16.479
Well, well.

09:17.910 --> 09:19.126
Hi boss.

09:20.773 --> 09:22.173
These are lovely.

09:22.848 --> 09:24.301
Here's your winner.

09:24.710 --> 09:26.310
I already picked this one.

09:27.676 --> 09:29.441
I guess it will have to do then.

09:37.628 --> 09:40.556
She's quite percy you know.
Woman your husband slept with.

09:40.557 --> 09:43.958
- At least the baby will be adorable.
- Why would you say something like that?

09:44.265 --> 09:48.059
What? The National Informer isn't
a reliable source of information?

09:48.464 --> 09:49.695
My mistake.

09:56.696 --> 09:58.209
You got time for a brother-in-law?

09:58.490 --> 10:00.507
David, hi!

10:00.991 --> 10:03.037
- Oh, it's good to see you.
- It's good to see you too.

10:03.038 --> 10:05.595
- It's crazy out there.
- Yeah, we're having a fashion show tonight.

10:05.596 --> 10:07.898
And the Noisettes are playing, so, it should be fun.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.549
Maybe I'll stop by.

10:09.798 --> 10:11.598
You know, Quinn's gonna be here.

10:12.156 --> 10:13.853
Does that might ?????? to stay away?

10:13.854 --> 10:16.235
No, no, that's not what I meant.

10:16.236 --> 10:20.188
I would love for you to come, I just feel like
it might be a little awkward right now.

10:22.258 --> 10:24.795
Could you give her a message from me?

10:25.195 --> 10:26.885
Just tell her I miss her,

10:26.886 --> 10:28.036
and that I love her.

10:29.126 --> 10:32.241
If she ever wants to talk to me I'll be
right here, I'm not going anywhere.

10:35.125 --> 10:37.620
- It was good to see you.
- To see you too.

10:38.451 --> 10:39.578
Okay.

10:40.127 --> 10:41.329
Bye.

10:45.468 --> 10:46.611
Millie.

10:46.757 --> 10:49.007
This... just came for you.

10:49.174 --> 10:51.174
Hi, Mrs. Davis. How are you?

10:52.190 --> 10:53.890
I'm sorry. Have we met?

10:54.065 --> 10:55.465
Yeah, many times.

10:55.875 --> 10:57.475
I used to date your daughter.

10:57.878 --> 11:00.392
Every time that I said "hello",
you asked me if we'd met.

11:00.978 --> 11:02.728
Well, until next time then.

11:08.499 --> 11:12.423
"To Millie: I'm sorry I can't be there for your
big night but I can't wait to celebrate.

11:12.424 --> 11:14.664
I'm proud of you. Love, Marvin. "

11:14.801 --> 11:15.951
Sweet.

11:16.317 --> 11:19.367
You know where this would
look perfect? In your car.

11:20.485 --> 11:22.791
Nice flowers! Who's the old lady?

11:23.155 --> 11:25.305
The old lady is Brooke's mother.

11:25.582 --> 11:27.733
Victoria, this is Alex Dupre.

11:27.734 --> 11:31.278
She's the star of tonight
show. Alex, Victoria Davis.

11:31.804 --> 11:34.198
So you're the former actress we're overpaying.

11:34.347 --> 11:36.584
Oh wait, Millie told me all about you.

11:36.940 --> 11:39.624
How you were this evil bitch
who used to run everything here,

11:39.625 --> 11:42.377
- but now you're just an evil bitch.
- I didn't say that.

11:42.621 --> 11:43.897
In those words.

11:44.276 --> 11:47.118
Well, I'll let you get back to not making movies.

11:49.205 --> 11:50.599
You are fun.

11:53.118 --> 11:55.776
Hey, Haley Bob. Have you seen these?

11:55.777 --> 11:58.194
Yeah, they are gorgeous.

11:58.521 --> 12:01.732
I could not help noticing that you
signed yourself as Quinn James.

12:02.421 --> 12:03.808
Yeah.

12:04.113 --> 12:05.388
I don't know.

12:05.552 --> 12:08.667
I thought it was a good idea.
You know, kinda like a fresh start.

12:09.126 --> 12:10.426
Fresh start?

12:11.529 --> 12:12.975
You know what I mean.

12:13.384 --> 12:16.039
You need to tell David how you feel, Quinn.

12:16.549 --> 12:19.686
He came by here today and he wanted
me to tell you that he loves you

12:20.027 --> 12:21.480
and he misses you,

12:21.645 --> 12:24.804
and he'll wait for you. And he meant every word of it.

12:25.768 --> 12:29.373
All I wanted more than anything was to
tell him that you felt the same way.

12:29.669 --> 12:31.769
Yeah, but that's not your place, is it?

12:32.095 --> 12:34.831
No, it's not. It's yours.

12:35.810 --> 12:39.991
Just tell him the truth, Quinn. He's still your
husband, even if you don't love him anymore.

12:40.517 --> 12:43.265
If you owe him anything at all, it's truth.

12:48.342 --> 12:50.341
Jamie Scott, you're late.

12:50.852 --> 12:51.852
I am?

12:51.853 --> 12:54.063
Aren't you here to help me
pass out these gift bags?

12:54.300 --> 12:57.860
- Sure. What do I do?
- Put one of those on every chair.

13:02.026 --> 13:03.442
Just... put my son to work?

13:03.443 --> 13:06.580
Absolutely. Clothes Over Bros
has a long history for child labor.

13:07.122 --> 13:09.051
I'm just kidding. I thought...

13:09.052 --> 13:11.316
it might help take his mind off things.

13:11.317 --> 13:13.526
- You read the National Informer.
- No.

13:13.673 --> 13:15.008
But I heard about it.

13:15.009 --> 13:16.521
I only read those things when I'm in them

13:16.522 --> 13:19.874
'cause I'm still waiting for that story
to come out about and Johnny Depp.

13:20.320 --> 13:21.320
Nice.

13:21.321 --> 13:24.621
Seriously, Nate, I've been on
the tabloids a thousand times,

13:24.622 --> 13:27.544
and it's never been anything but rumors and lies.

13:27.751 --> 13:28.968
Look...

13:29.235 --> 13:31.587
all you can do is weather the storm

13:31.588 --> 13:34.005
don't feed the flame and make it worse.

13:34.006 --> 13:36.216
And eventually they'll move on to somebody else.

13:36.624 --> 13:38.124
I just have one question.

13:38.827 --> 13:41.037
How do you explain that to a seven-year-old?

13:55.807 --> 13:58.506
Quinn told me the guys were
teasing you this morning.

13:58.788 --> 14:00.429
Want to talk about it?

14:01.153 --> 14:03.604
Chuck said that I was gonna
have a brother or a sister.

14:07.496 --> 14:10.026
I promise you if you ever do
have a little brothers or sister,

14:10.167 --> 14:11.641
it would be from your mom and me.

14:13.381 --> 14:14.829
Why is she lying?

14:15.036 --> 14:18.454
Cause sometimes bad people forget
the difference between right and wrong.

14:19.843 --> 14:21.533
And these people, sometimes...

14:22.116 --> 14:23.899
they like to take advantage of good people...

14:23.909 --> 14:24.932
like us.

14:26.613 --> 14:28.341
Do you ever forget?

14:28.515 --> 14:29.566
No.

14:29.829 --> 14:30.843
And you know why?

14:30.947 --> 14:33.801
'Cause every time I'm not so
sure I'm doing the right thing,

14:34.055 --> 14:36.346
I take a look at this picture of you and your mom,

14:37.069 --> 14:39.801
and it reminds me of everything that's important to me.

14:40.665 --> 14:42.900
And it always helps me do the right thing.

14:44.876 --> 14:45.924
Ok?

14:55.597 --> 14:57.113
I need you for about 10 minutes.

14:57.123 --> 14:59.249
There's a reporter here from
Visual Lyrics Magazine

14:59.259 --> 15:01.625
and she wants to ask you a few
questions about Red Bedroom.

15:01.944 --> 15:05.879
I'm not really up for an interview
today, Miranda, okay?

15:06.315 --> 15:08.071
No, it's not okay.

15:08.470 --> 15:11.768
This label needs is starving for some good
press, and it's exactly how you get it.

15:12.050 --> 15:15.227
So if that means to take a
few minutes to kiss it at last...

15:15.294 --> 15:17.128
you get up and do it.

15:18.637 --> 15:21.778
The truth is, this reporter has influence

15:21.936 --> 15:24.270
and we don't want her on our bad side, okay?

15:26.802 --> 15:28.210
Ten minutes.

15:30.670 --> 15:31.692
Vicki.

15:31.891 --> 15:34.346
Brooke didn't tell me you
were coming in for the show.

15:34.434 --> 15:38.115
Consider me Millicent training wheels,
and don't ever call me Vicki again.

15:39.505 --> 15:41.177
Sorry. I thought we were bonding.

15:41.289 --> 15:42.679
You thought wrong.

15:43.632 --> 15:45.144
Tell me... how's your father?

15:45.247 --> 15:46.862
- It's Paul, right?
- Yeah.

15:46.965 --> 15:48.815
Has he taken a lover recently?

15:49.627 --> 15:51.177
What just happened?

15:51.362 --> 15:53.327
Sorry. I thought we were bonding.

15:53.458 --> 15:55.008
You thought wrong.

15:56.829 --> 15:58.951
You know, my daughter seems so happy lately.

15:58.961 --> 16:01.596
In fact, she seems happier that I've ever seen her.

16:03.007 --> 16:04.548
I'm assuming I owe that to you.

16:04.848 --> 16:06.754
Are you starting to approve of me?

16:06.895 --> 16:08.135
Don't be silly.

16:08.145 --> 16:09.928
She could do so much better.

16:11.637 --> 16:12.886
Good bye, Julian.

16:13.688 --> 16:15.538
Say hello to Paul for me.

16:15.857 --> 16:18.810
You tell him if he's ever in search
of a lover, to give me a call.

16:20.707 --> 16:22.792
Please stop saying "lover".

16:23.590 --> 16:25.590
Everyone knows about Mia Catalano.

16:25.768 --> 16:27.440
What about Haley James Scott?

16:28.106 --> 16:30.138
When does your next album come out, Haley?

16:30.745 --> 16:33.327
We've been working hard so, hopefully soon.

16:33.568 --> 16:35.561
Maybe I'll send you some tracks see if you like them.

16:35.571 --> 16:36.756
I'd like that.

16:36.766 --> 16:38.810
Now, let's talk about your
reaction when you found out

16:38.820 --> 16:40.641
your husband not only had an affair

16:40.651 --> 16:42.887
but has got another woman pregnant .

16:42.897 --> 16:44.496
Sorry, Angela. Time's up.

16:44.506 --> 16:46.833
You promised me 10 minutes,
Miranda. It's only been 5.

16:46.843 --> 16:50.037
Well, you forfeited the other 5 when
you asked that stupid question.

16:50.047 --> 16:52.343
- The question was relevant.
- No, it was personnal.

16:52.353 --> 16:54.307
Now, if you really wanna get personnal,

16:54.317 --> 16:56.429
we can talk about that time
in the Hamptons three years ago,

16:56.439 --> 16:58.280
when you got drunk and soiled yourself.

16:58.290 --> 17:00.617
Now, that was a messy situation.

17:01.945 --> 17:04.030
Look, that never happened.
You just made that up.

17:04.040 --> 17:07.146
Oh, then I'm sure you're sympathetic to Haley's situation...

17:07.503 --> 17:10.022
since her husband's affair was also made up.

17:12.425 --> 17:13.425
Off you go.

17:14.575 --> 17:16.711
We'll look forward to reading your column.

17:26.281 --> 17:27.755
What if she hates us?

17:27.796 --> 17:29.213
Who reads "Reviews" anyway?

17:39.049 --> 17:40.196
Excuse me.

17:40.438 --> 17:42.728
Those waters are for the models, not the help.

17:42.738 --> 17:43.833
Oh, no, I'm not...

17:43.843 --> 17:46.312
Supposed to be back here. I know, sweetie.

17:46.781 --> 17:50.131
You see this, is where the pretty people play.

17:51.163 --> 17:52.750
You don't qualify.

17:58.436 --> 17:59.957
Makenna Gage, right?

18:00.304 --> 18:02.933
Oh, my gosh, you're so pretty in person.

18:03.281 --> 18:05.450
All the other girls are such skanks.

18:05.824 --> 18:08.196
- I'm Alex, by the way.
- I know who you are.

18:08.458 --> 18:09.724
I love your movies.

18:09.911 --> 18:13.078
I'm actually doing some acting down
too, but I still model on the side.

18:13.088 --> 18:15.044
Oh, I knew that we had
something in common.

18:15.054 --> 18:17.695
You remember that movie you
did about the double agent?

18:18.195 --> 18:20.055
I auditioned for your part.

18:20.065 --> 18:22.071
Well, they told me I was too hot.

18:22.719 --> 18:23.893
No offense.

18:25.033 --> 18:26.408
Oh, my God.

18:26.851 --> 18:29.202
We should totally do a movie together.

18:29.522 --> 18:31.813
Totally. We would have so much fun.

18:33.428 --> 18:35.027
You party, right?

18:35.296 --> 18:38.541
Of course you do. You have to try
these, they're so kick-ass.

18:38.745 --> 18:41.824
I usually take three, but you
should probably only take two.

18:42.853 --> 18:44.101
Give me four.

18:58.829 --> 19:00.026
Hi, David.

19:00.833 --> 19:01.951
Quinn.

19:06.787 --> 19:08.026
It's good to see you.

19:08.036 --> 19:09.036
You too.

19:15.965 --> 19:18.322
This reminds me of this park where we first met.

19:20.260 --> 19:22.312
You know, I almost proposed you there.

19:22.322 --> 19:24.680
Really? You never told me that.

19:25.528 --> 19:27.577
I had the ring. It was a bveautiful night.

19:28.753 --> 19:31.815
You were a little drunk, so I've been
asking myself the chances to ask.

19:34.736 --> 19:36.070
So what happened?

19:37.552 --> 19:39.627
I decided to wait for a better moment.

19:41.787 --> 19:43.383
Well, that's us isn't it?

19:44.890 --> 19:46.787
Always waiting for something.

19:47.688 --> 19:48.918
That's not true.

19:49.613 --> 19:51.632
Remember that job in San Francisco?

19:52.782 --> 19:55.723
You didn't take it because you
felt something better might come.

19:55.733 --> 19:56.782
And it did.

19:57.242 --> 19:58.242
I know it did.

19:58.778 --> 20:00.478
And you were right to wait.

20:01.679 --> 20:06.279
But that was two years of our lives we could have
been experiencing something exciting and new, and...

20:07.655 --> 20:09.946
instead we just put our lives on hold.

20:10.693 --> 20:12.242
I didn't realize you felt that way.

20:13.585 --> 20:15.218
I didn't at the time.

20:15.383 --> 20:18.941
You know, we made that decision together,
and I was fine with that decision then.

20:20.748 --> 20:23.396
The person I am today wouldn't
have waited those two years.

20:23.406 --> 20:24.406
Ok.

20:25.331 --> 20:27.294
I understand that, but I can change too.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.880
I can be whoever you want me to be.

20:32.652 --> 20:35.369
I won't wait you change for me.

20:35.448 --> 20:36.688
It's not fair.

20:37.143 --> 20:40.195
I want you to be you because,
you're a wonderful person.

20:43.894 --> 20:47.481
So is this the part you tell me you love
me, but you're not in love with me?

20:53.740 --> 20:55.280
So that's it?

20:56.711 --> 20:58.918
There's nothing I can do to save our marriage?

21:01.086 --> 21:03.008
I'm sorry, David.

21:04.649 --> 21:06.932
I think we should get a divorce.

21:25.720 --> 21:29.209
That is the sexy group. You girls look amazing.

21:29.229 --> 21:33.097
And when you're out there,  don't worry, they
will be staring at you, they will be staring at me.

21:33.117 --> 21:34.399
Wait.

21:35.352 --> 21:37.502
Where is the red cocktail dress?

21:38.399 --> 21:40.633
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... 9!

21:40.883 --> 21:43.933
- Why am I counting nine?
- Because there's nine of us.

21:44.758 --> 21:46.781
Where is Makenna?

21:47.820 --> 21:50.274
Someobody wake her up.

21:50.430 --> 21:54.539
Good luck, I saw her swallow a
hand full of pills. She's such a cliche.

21:54.696 --> 21:57.496
Victoria, please, tell me you can fix this.

21:58.024 --> 22:01.867
This is Millie's show, remember?
I'm sure she has a backup plan.

22:01.887 --> 22:03.430
Yes, I do.

22:03.450 --> 22:05.685
We double up one model. The first girl on stage

22:05.705 --> 22:07.816
changes and goes out in the final piece.

22:07.836 --> 22:08.932
Ok.

22:09.242 --> 22:11.805
Okay, that works... what about the final work?

22:11.825 --> 22:14.930
- We loose one piece from the collection.
- That's unacceptable.

22:14.950 --> 22:17.492
- Millie can handle it.
- Well, clearly she can't.

22:17.512 --> 22:20.380
No, I mean Millie can do it,
she can take Makenna's place.

22:20.461 --> 22:22.477
Me? I'm not a model.

22:22.497 --> 22:24.180
She's definitely not a model.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.453
Neither am I, but I'm still going out there.

22:26.473 --> 22:31.113
She's gorgeous, she's got better legs than Makenna
and let's face it, and she's your only option.

22:31.133 --> 22:34.504
Unless, of course, you want to
go out there with your walker.

22:34.524 --> 22:36.164
Millie, strip down.

22:36.336 --> 22:38.312
Chop chop.

22:47.913 --> 22:50.507
Chase, I thought you managed this place now.

22:50.527 --> 22:53.426
Mostly. But, I kinda miss being back here.

22:53.446 --> 22:58.078
I invented a new drink, you should
try. It's called "the brain hemorrhage".

22:58.820 --> 23:01.617
You know there's already a drink
called the brain hemorrhage, right?

23:02.258 --> 23:04.852
I'm sorry, man. I'm sure yours is much better.

23:04.872 --> 23:06.972
Damn it! I'll get you a beer.

23:06.992 --> 23:08.800
Ok.

23:08.820 --> 23:10.336
- Hey, man.
- Hey.

23:10.356 --> 23:12.584
Listen, the press are gonna be here
later, so I want you to practise

23:12.604 --> 23:14.484
two very important words...

23:14.742 --> 23:17.297
- "No comment".
- What if I do make a comment?

23:17.492 --> 23:20.047
Maybe just... tell my side of things?

23:20.067 --> 23:23.610
I'd be careful about that, it's just
a game you don't wanna play.

23:26.070 --> 23:28.633
So, what do you think? It's not bad, eh?

23:29.789 --> 23:32.639
It's delicious, it should be illegal.

23:35.309 --> 23:37.399
This is the worst drink I ever had.

23:37.419 --> 23:40.531
- Brain hemorrhage?
- Yeah, good call on the beer.

23:44.680 --> 23:46.780
How are those nerves holding up?

23:47.102 --> 23:50.711
I'm about to be judged by fashion critics
who had to fly to North Carolina

23:50.867 --> 23:53.167
and love to witness failure.

23:53.742 --> 23:57.092
Well, then I guess they're gonna
be disappointed tonight.

23:57.789 --> 24:00.667
I brought you something that's
gonna relieve all your stress.

24:00.687 --> 24:02.399
You got me a present?

24:03.508 --> 24:05.102
Sandalwood.

24:06.858 --> 24:09.187
It must have broken in half on the way over here.

24:10.789 --> 24:13.836
Oh well, I guess this will have to do.

24:25.426 --> 24:26.631
You still nervous?

24:26.912 --> 24:28.209
For what?

24:28.641 --> 24:29.769
Where am I?

24:36.097 --> 24:38.671
I want to thank you all
for coming here tonight.

24:38.691 --> 24:41.207
Those of you who traveled
down here to Tree Hill.

24:41.227 --> 24:44.379
I know we're not in New
York but this is my home

24:44.535 --> 24:49.222
and this is the place that inspired the line,
so I hope you enjoy it as much as we do.

24:51.465 --> 24:54.863
Now, to kick us off, we are thrilled to bring you...

24:54.883 --> 24:56.629
Noisettes!

25:12.292 --> 25:13.292
Hey.

26:29.114 --> 26:30.643
- I'll be right back.
- Ok.

26:35.393 --> 26:36.690
- Hey.
- Hey!

26:37.018 --> 26:38.343
The show just started.

26:38.363 --> 26:39.963
- Fine.
- Good.

26:40.150 --> 26:41.750
Did you talk to David?

26:42.143 --> 26:43.143
Yeah.

26:43.784 --> 26:45.584
I don't want to hurt him, Haley.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.505
This is what I have to do.

26:47.713 --> 26:48.924
You okay?

26:49.518 --> 26:51.252
I'm fine, I'm fine.

26:51.612 --> 26:53.427
This is Brooke's night.

26:59.237 --> 27:01.393
I can't do this, what if they laugh?

27:01.413 --> 27:05.862
Nobody is gonna laugh. Your hot ass is
about to pull the roof off of this place.

27:05.882 --> 27:07.815
- Millie, are you ready for this?
- I don't know Brooke,

27:07.835 --> 27:10.485
it doesn't feel right. I'm not a size zero.

27:11.237 --> 27:14.424
- What did you just say?
- I said I'm not a size zero.

27:15.815 --> 27:17.628
Of course you're not.

27:18.268 --> 27:20.518
Millie, I have an idea,
I just need more time.

27:20.538 --> 27:22.081
I got this.

28:07.380 --> 28:09.511
Is that Millie? She looks gorgeous!

28:45.826 --> 28:48.271
So, you were clearly the crowd favorite tonight.

28:48.306 --> 28:51.044
When did you come out with this
idea to put yourself in the show?

28:51.079 --> 28:53.063
Well, the truth is, one of our models...

28:53.098 --> 28:55.955
One of our models, Alex Dupre
she was brought in specially

28:55.990 --> 28:58.913
to headline this collection.
She was a fabulous choice,

28:58.948 --> 29:01.791
but we had this little surprise
planned for several months.

29:01.826 --> 29:04.164
Clothes Over Bros is a line for real women.

29:04.199 --> 29:06.083
Zero is not a size.

29:06.337 --> 29:09.200
We're just thrilled that all of you
responded the way we hoped you will.

29:09.235 --> 29:11.334
Thank you so much for coming.

29:11.827 --> 29:13.882
I'll give it to you... you're good.

29:13.917 --> 29:14.917
I know.

29:16.657 --> 29:18.031
Hey Alex, is Brooke around?

29:18.066 --> 29:20.361
Oh,she's somewhere receiving praise.

29:20.396 --> 29:21.941
I thought you were avoiding me.

29:21.976 --> 29:23.298
Why would I avoid you?

29:23.333 --> 29:26.071
I don't know. Maybe because you
haven't read the script I gave you?

29:26.106 --> 29:27.409
Oh, I read it.

29:27.513 --> 29:29.198
You want my honest opinion?

29:29.439 --> 29:30.439
Of course.

29:30.695 --> 29:32.300
It's not that good.

29:32.688 --> 29:33.926
Which part?

29:34.626 --> 29:36.837
The beginning, middle and end.

29:38.270 --> 29:40.622
Ok, uh... what did you hate about it?

29:40.748 --> 29:44.682
I didn't say I hated it. The
writing just needs a little focus.

29:44.717 --> 29:49.057
But somewhere underneath all the clutter,
I think there is a really solid story there.

29:49.178 --> 29:52.384
I wouldn't mind meeting with the writer. I got a few ideas.

29:53.299 --> 29:54.605
I wrote it.

29:55.052 --> 29:57.664
- You wrote what?
- That clutter filled messy you hated.

29:57.699 --> 30:00.225
- No, I told you, I didn't hate it.
- You said it wasn't good.

30:00.260 --> 30:02.380
I also said it has potential.

30:02.612 --> 30:04.899
And if that's your first script...

30:05.807 --> 30:07.656
I am really impressed, Alex.

30:08.113 --> 30:11.120
If you're serious about this, I would
be willing to work with you on it.

30:11.155 --> 30:13.051
But only if you're committeed.

30:13.506 --> 30:15.967
I would love to commit to you, Julian.

30:20.039 --> 30:22.651
- We're totally gonna make this movie.
- Okay, hold on.

30:22.686 --> 30:25.053
Let's get the script in shape
first, after that we'll see.

30:25.088 --> 30:26.088
Ok.

30:41.205 --> 30:42.284
I forgot.

30:42.557 --> 30:45.545
How'd it go with the famous
actress? Was it oscar worthy?

30:46.278 --> 30:47.846
- It was just sex.
- Right.

30:49.234 --> 30:52.273
You know, I'm trying to figure out if this is the person you really are

30:52.308 --> 30:55.337
or just the person you want
everyone to think that you are.

30:56.588 --> 30:58.467
Maybe a little of both.

31:01.210 --> 31:03.106
You look like you need a drink.

31:03.776 --> 31:04.776
Yes.

31:05.335 --> 31:07.690
I want one of those blue
drinks, those look good.

31:08.861 --> 31:09.861
Chase...

31:10.037 --> 31:11.837
another brain hemorrhage.

31:12.098 --> 31:14.293
It's called a brain blaster now.

31:14.430 --> 31:16.899
Right, just make sure it's extra blue.

31:24.476 --> 31:26.315
- What's this?
- That's the last minute changes.

31:26.350 --> 31:28.136
- Who made them.
- Charlie.

31:28.840 --> 31:30.846
We're alive at three...

31:31.596 --> 31:32.624
two...

32:05.451 --> 32:06.451
Miranda.

32:06.896 --> 32:07.937
Listen...

32:07.972 --> 32:10.296
I just wanted to thank you for
what you did earlier.

32:10.331 --> 32:12.429
I felt a little blindsight in there, and...

32:12.464 --> 32:14.680
it meant a lot that you stuck up for me.

32:14.715 --> 32:16.263
I'm just being consistent.

32:16.298 --> 32:19.568
If they're not willing to let you use
personal issues as an excuse to get off work,

32:19.603 --> 32:23.276
I am certainly not gonna let
some bitch come in the way.

32:23.311 --> 32:26.415
Ok. Well, whatever your motivation was, thank you.

32:26.596 --> 32:29.977
You're welcome. And besides,
I've I always hated that cow.

32:35.062 --> 32:38.807
And Albert Pujols continued his
torrid summer by knocking in 4 runs,

32:38.842 --> 32:42.131
as the Redbirds drop the Phillies 8 to 5.

32:42.166 --> 32:43.259
And finally...

32:50.323 --> 32:52.792
that is the night in sports.

32:54.558 --> 32:57.254
Go to commercial, go to commercial now.

33:01.900 --> 33:03.688
You just keep walking McFadden.

33:03.723 --> 33:05.707
You're off the air.

33:38.059 --> 33:40.158
- What took you so long?
- Sorry.

33:40.193 --> 33:42.079
Running low on Jagermaister and Sambuca.

33:42.114 --> 33:43.447
Is he being serious?

33:43.743 --> 33:47.948
Yep, never mind that. Just sit back and
enjoy this delicious blue masterpiece.

33:53.749 --> 33:56.664
- That's really good, thank you.
- You are the boss.

33:58.173 --> 34:00.136
Oh my God, you're so evil.

34:00.462 --> 34:03.162
I'm sure I'm gonna have nightmares about
this drink. Why would you do that?

34:03.197 --> 34:06.260
So now we can say we both went throught it.

34:07.898 --> 34:09.263
Can I talk to you?

34:10.915 --> 34:11.915
David.

34:12.952 --> 34:14.853
Look, this isn't the time or place for this.

34:14.889 --> 34:17.179
- You're my wife, Quinn.
- And you're drunk.

34:17.726 --> 34:19.850
Just go home and sleep it off,
ok? We'll talk about it later.

34:19.885 --> 34:21.983
- No, I want to talk about it now.
- No, I don't want to.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.743
- I want to talk about it now.
- No.

34:23.777 --> 34:25.210
You need to back up.

34:25.245 --> 34:27.493
And you need to stay out of this,
this is none of your business.

34:27.527 --> 34:30.953
I'm making it my business, alright?
You think you're having a rough day.

34:33.879 --> 34:35.277
Damn it, Clay.

34:44.652 --> 34:47.272
Fighting over a girl... huge turn on.

34:47.786 --> 34:49.402
I was just defending a friend.

34:49.438 --> 34:52.396
Well, that's good to know,
I was getting a little jealous.

34:53.378 --> 34:55.422
You know, I'm still turned on though.

34:55.456 --> 34:58.076
How about I come over later
and take care of that hand...

34:58.111 --> 35:01.806
and any other body part that
might need special attention?

35:03.193 --> 35:04.806
Maybe some other time.

35:07.068 --> 35:09.953
You did great tonight, Alex. I'll see you.

35:15.517 --> 35:16.674
Nathan Scott!

35:16.752 --> 35:21.224
Do you have a comment regarding the allegations
made about you in the National Informer?

35:21.913 --> 35:23.732
Yes, I do have a comment.

35:23.966 --> 35:27.307
I'd just like to say, I'm very proud of my friend Brooke Davis.

35:27.372 --> 35:30.981
Tonight she reminded all of us just how talented she is.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.997
As for the other stuff, no I have no comment.

35:34.478 --> 35:35.596
Thanks.

35:41.857 --> 35:44.768
I hate to admit it, but
Millicent really did pull it off.

35:44.807 --> 35:47.354
Yeah. And Alex really pulled it off her.

35:49.542 --> 35:52.115
- She did. That was a good idea.
- Thank you.

35:53.051 --> 35:55.417
I tell you what's not such a good idea...

35:55.469 --> 35:57.951
letting that girl got to close to Julian.

35:58.042 --> 35:59.145
Alex?

36:01.094 --> 36:03.942
He just read some script she gave him.

36:04.046 --> 36:07.867
- Julian is a good guy, mom.
- Yes, he is.

36:09.289 --> 36:13.175
And I have a feeling she wrecked
a few good guys in her day.

36:21.603 --> 36:22.721
Hey, Alex.

36:23.254 --> 36:26.022
Listen, I just wanted to thank you
for everything you did for me tonight.

36:26.074 --> 36:28.460
I still can't believe that was me.

36:28.785 --> 36:30.813
- Hum, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Hold on, bitch.

36:30.878 --> 36:33.243
There's no way I'm letting you go home.

36:33.321 --> 36:36.402
There's an after-after party that
nobody's invited to, except us.

36:36.467 --> 36:38.559
- You're going.
- That's not really my scene.

36:38.611 --> 36:42.291
It is now. Look, don't worry I'll have your
cute ass home before the sun comes up.

36:42.356 --> 36:44.487
And if you hate it, we'll leave.

36:45.488 --> 36:47.231
Come on, come on.

36:47.400 --> 36:49.662
Please? Say yes.

36:54.598 --> 36:56.391
- Yes.
- Yes.

36:56.625 --> 36:57.860
Let's go. Come on.

37:00.550 --> 37:02.193
Hey, Millie. It's me.

37:03.557 --> 37:06.977
I kinda had a bad night, so
I was really hoping to talk to you.

37:07.068 --> 37:09.109
You always make me feel better.

37:09.434 --> 37:12.521
Anyway, I'm sure the show is great
and I can't wait to hear all about it.

37:12.599 --> 37:14.509
I'll wait up. I love you.

37:58.708 --> 38:01.776
You know, even with all the
models on this stage tonight

38:01.997 --> 38:04.713
the most beautiful woman
at the show was backstage.

38:05.160 --> 38:06.213
Thank you.

38:06.265 --> 38:07.980
No, I was talking about Victoria.

38:10.489 --> 38:15.308
I'm thinking of setting her up with my dad.
Apparently she's in search of a lover.

38:15.789 --> 38:18.193
- What just happened?
- Don't ask.

38:18.219 --> 38:19.311
Ok.

38:20.685 --> 38:24.455
I saw you talking to Alex. How did she take it
when you told her you don't like the script?

38:24.494 --> 38:26.989
Actually, it turns out, she wrote
it, and she needs some help.

38:27.041 --> 38:29.460
So I'm gonna work with her on that.

38:29.941 --> 38:33.814
Who knows? Maybe we can get it in a good
enough shape and make a movie out of it.

38:41.294 --> 38:43.214
I don't know how I'm gonna do this.

38:44.072 --> 38:47.445
I don't know how to let you go.
I don't know how to keep you.

38:48.497 --> 38:50.300
This isn't you, Quinn.

38:52.094 --> 38:53.874
Maybe you're right, David.

38:54.849 --> 38:57.293
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

38:57.539 --> 38:59.639
Is this the life you want?

39:00.406 --> 39:02.160
Fancy parties, celebrities?

39:02.212 --> 39:04.403
Or is that the life you think you want.

39:05.464 --> 39:07.180
Maybe a little of both.

39:13.197 --> 39:15.394
I want you to go home, David.

39:18.530 --> 39:21.676
I think it's time we move on with our lives.

39:24.191 --> 39:26.621
You need to go home and let go of me.

39:29.910 --> 39:31.106
I won't.

39:33.198 --> 39:34.446
You're gonna have to.

39:35.161 --> 39:38.741
You know, you're... working hard to
convince yourself that's it's over,

39:39.014 --> 39:40.952
but you'll never love me again.

39:43.032 --> 39:46.424
But nothing you do is gonna
make me go with hope.

39:47.351 --> 39:49.365
You'd be better off letting me go.

40:02.200 --> 40:04.280
- Give me a ride?
- Sure.

40:08.790 --> 40:09.980
Where to?

40:10.551 --> 40:11.656
Your place.

40:16.503 --> 40:18.160
You sure you wanna do this?

40:19.168 --> 40:20.753
He'll never forgive you.

40:22.239 --> 40:23.735
Just drive.

40:39.911 --> 40:41.198
What are you doing here?

40:41.848 --> 40:43.108
He doesn't love you.

40:45.409 --> 40:47.410
Honey, you don't know
what you're talking about.

40:47.917 --> 40:50.325
He told me while we were making love.

40:50.858 --> 40:53.249
Get the hell out of my way, slut.

40:53.437 --> 40:56.179
Maybe I am a slut, but that's
what Nathan liked about me.

40:56.231 --> 41:00.105
He had me do all kinds of things to him
that he said you would never...

41:04.516 --> 41:06.257
You're gonna pay for that one.

41:13.260 --> 41:16.032
