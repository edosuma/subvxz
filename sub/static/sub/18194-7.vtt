00:00.031 --> 00:01.523
<i>Previously on</i> THE ROYALS...

00:01.589 --> 00:03.223
So you want to tell me what this
text is about?

00:03.270 --> 00:05.148
I'm working on a story about
her Royal Highness.

00:05.210 --> 00:07.539
And the relationship she's
having with her bodyguard.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.179
I gave you so many chances.

00:09.234 --> 00:11.968
Yeah, well, you shouldn't
have. I'm not worth it.

00:12.453 --> 00:14.734
If I didn't make it back alive,
she'd have kicked my arse.

00:14.834 --> 00:17.859
And now she just
has to wipe it. Cheers.

00:19.109 --> 00:22.177
'I'd like to hire you.'
'To do what exactly?'

00:22.281 --> 00:25.755
whatever it is you did
and however it is you did it.

00:25.882 --> 00:26.895
Do you want to have sex?

00:26.943 --> 00:30.309
'When posed by you, the answer
to that question is always yes.'

00:30.450 --> 00:32.302
I want to start a charity
for wounded vets,

00:32.362 --> 00:34.138
help them get their lives
back on track.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.768
Mum's been filling me in on
everything you've been doing,

00:36.837 --> 00:37.895
all your charity work.

00:37.958 --> 00:39.903
She thought maybe
I should take it over.

00:39.960 --> 00:42.714
We can't even take a picture together
because you're afraid it might get out.

00:42.761 --> 00:44.447
Do you mind taking a picture
of us, Sparrow?

00:44.494 --> 00:46.278
I know you have history
with Robert,

00:46.372 --> 00:48.489
but you have a future with me.

00:48.598 --> 00:51.395
I want you.
And I will fight for you.

00:51.950 --> 00:54.160
Sparrow.
Don't call me that.

00:54.588 --> 00:58.654
The People's Gala's coming up. I challenge
you to spar for charity. Three rounds.

01:03.089 --> 01:04.111

Every night this week.
I can't imagine why.

01:52.994 --> 01:55.553
- You've been working hard.
- We both have.

01:56.064 --> 01:57.416
Oh, talking of work,

01:57.464 --> 02:00.244
we need to finalize
your participation

02:00.292 --> 02:02.432
in the charity auction
at the Gala.

02:03.987 --> 02:05.260
I know the Gala's important,

02:05.308 --> 02:07.541
but the thought
that anyone who buys a ticket.

02:07.589 --> 02:10.189
Can win an hour of my time
is dreadful.

02:10.229 --> 02:14.532
And as a newly-single queen,
if a man wins,

02:14.601 --> 02:16.920
it's gonna feel like
some awful blind date.

02:16.968 --> 02:19.444
I'd buy a ticket if I could,
Your Majesty.

02:20.112 --> 02:22.179

You fired another bodyguard,
Princess?

02:58.478 --> 02:59.917
He wasn't working out.

03:00.001 --> 03:01.909
Joseph had
a stellar service record.

03:01.986 --> 03:04.564
He also had Cologne that smelled
like an airplane toilet.

03:04.612 --> 03:06.892
That's the fifth bodyguard
in two weeks.

03:06.970 --> 03:08.369
Is it possible...

03:08.447 --> 03:10.929
This is about another
bodyguard in particular?

03:13.976 --> 03:16.788
No. It's not.

03:17.695 --> 03:21.132
It's about terrible taste
in men's grooming products.

03:27.815 --> 03:29.314
James?

03:31.593 --> 03:33.335
Did he say where he was going?

03:33.432 --> 03:36.734
No, he didn't. He simply
asked for some time away.

03:39.804 --> 03:41.570
I've got a charity Gala to prepare.

03:41.624 --> 03:43.406
And an interview to get to.

03:51.929 --> 03:53.498
Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late.
I'm Eleanor.

03:53.567 --> 03:57.148
Your Highness, Harper day. Thank you so
much for taking time to meet with me.

03:57.257 --> 03:59.538
I'm really looking forward
to writing this piece.

04:00.273 --> 04:02.218
I love what you've done
with the place.

04:02.345 --> 04:03.411
Yeah.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.858
- So, this is a lot of work.
- Mm-hm.

04:06.906 --> 04:09.086
How do you find time
for your personal life?

04:09.217 --> 04:10.584
Well, it's just for a few weeks,

04:10.641 --> 04:13.140
and the Gala's really important.

04:13.593 --> 04:15.353
No time for a personal life?

04:15.452 --> 04:17.241
I mean, most people
would think a Princess.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.765
Can do what she wants
with her time.

04:18.827 --> 04:19.990
Well, yeah.

04:20.038 --> 04:22.366
This is...
This is what I want to do.

04:22.468 --> 04:24.996
Designing and making things
is a thrill for me.

04:25.879 --> 04:29.116
But... no boy
to share it with?

04:29.569 --> 04:31.469
Look, I was nice
the first two times.

04:31.538 --> 04:34.405
That you not-so-elegantly
brought this subject up,

04:34.429 --> 04:36.374
but your interview
is now complete.

04:36.483 --> 04:38.983
Publish whatever you'd like
and see yourself out.

04:42.929 --> 04:45.132
'It's the hottest ticket in town,

04:45.194 --> 04:47.718
the 72nd Annual People's Gala

04:47.766 --> 04:51.387
a two-day event beginning with the
Ultra-VIP Champagne reception

04:51.435 --> 04:53.238
with the Royal family.

04:53.487 --> 04:56.597
This year's Gala marks prince
Robert's first public appearance.

04:56.645 --> 05:00.152
Since his highly anticipated
debut on the Royal Balcony.

05:00.472 --> 05:04.736
And if you were thinking of buying those
Gala tickets aftermarket, don't bother...

05:04.804 --> 05:07.808
if you weren't invited,
you're not invited.'

05:11.754 --> 05:14.066
so, ready for the fight tomorrow?

05:14.129 --> 05:16.855
I think Liam's a lot tougher
than we've given him credit for.

05:16.941 --> 05:18.883
I'm not too worried about it.

05:19.519 --> 05:22.066
You haven't talked to
any of the young ladies

05:22.117 --> 05:23.996
I invited here this evening.

05:24.891 --> 05:26.524
Your Majesty.

05:26.957 --> 05:28.960
I'll go get us a drink.

05:29.195 --> 05:31.073
I know
it's not exactly romantic,

05:31.131 --> 05:33.998
but we need to think of your
future beyond the Privy Council.

05:34.067 --> 05:37.569
I understand, but formal lists are for
leaders who don't know what they want.

05:37.637 --> 05:38.937
That's what your father said.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.324
And then I happened
to be on his list.

05:41.419 --> 05:43.012
And look how that turned out.

05:44.444 --> 05:46.244
Sorry. That was unfair.

05:46.613 --> 05:49.769
I get it that we all have to
make sacrifices for the family,

05:49.832 --> 05:51.182
but that doesn't exclude you.

05:51.251 --> 05:53.730
Fine. I'll meet you halfway.

05:53.941 --> 05:55.587
If I do the auction,

05:55.655 --> 05:59.597
will you give an official
list a fair consideration?

06:01.072 --> 06:02.801
Fine. We have a deal.

06:03.459 --> 06:05.493
♪ I keep on dreaming ♪

06:05.932 --> 06:07.480
♪ I got them feelings ♪

06:07.584 --> 06:08.590
Madden!

06:08.638 --> 06:09.885
- Ah!
- What are you doing here?

06:09.933 --> 06:11.871
How could I miss
the year's biggest Gala?

06:11.933 --> 06:14.772
Plus, you need someone in your
corner for the boxing, you know.

06:14.989 --> 06:17.022
The...
The boxing match, yeah.

06:17.683 --> 06:20.245
Oh, I get it.
You're here about a girl.

06:20.313 --> 06:23.448
She's coming over.
Tell her I'm... I'm cool.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.110
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Okay.

06:28.380 --> 06:29.930
Madden's... cool.

06:30.046 --> 06:31.829
Um... okay.

06:32.922 --> 06:34.855
I believe I owe you
a free drink.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.595
Only a month later.
Perfect timing.

06:37.821 --> 06:39.187
How are you?

06:39.326 --> 06:41.048
How's the girl?

06:41.798 --> 06:45.370
Let's just say things are...
Not perfect.

06:47.107 --> 06:48.466
What about you?

06:48.555 --> 06:50.278
- Madden?
- Mm.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.771
He's... nice.

06:52.979 --> 06:55.411
Funny. But... I don't know.

06:55.817 --> 06:57.382
Not perfect.

06:59.888 --> 07:01.986
- Excuse me, Your Highness?
- Yes?

07:02.055 --> 07:03.855
Would you mind taking a photo?

07:04.391 --> 07:05.923
- Uh... I do mind.
- Oh.

07:05.992 --> 07:07.692
But it's for a good cause.

07:08.595 --> 07:12.002
Oh, I meant of me in the ring.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.133
Oh, right. Okay.

07:15.201 --> 07:17.268
Cool.

07:18.371 --> 07:20.038
Thank you.

07:27.180 --> 07:28.513
Get your heels in the shot.

07:28.581 --> 07:30.214
So it looks like
you knocked me out.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.279
- Does that work for you?
- Perfect.

07:38.638 --> 07:40.081
Here you are.

07:41.726 --> 07:44.585
Amazing. And very kind
of you to play along.

07:45.611 --> 07:46.810
I'm Sebastian.

07:46.968 --> 07:49.078
I'm not having a great day,
Sebastian.

07:49.152 --> 07:50.367
I'm sorry to hear that.

07:50.415 --> 07:53.828
But if I may say, the fact that you're
here on a bad day says a lot about you.

07:54.177 --> 07:56.242
Yes, well,
it's for a good cause, so...

07:56.523 --> 07:57.942
I agree.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.544
I've been to this Gala before,

07:59.612 --> 08:01.446
but they really stepped
it up this year.

08:01.514 --> 08:03.915
Whoever designed this place
is amazing.

08:05.418 --> 08:07.925
Anyway,
I hope your day gets better.

08:08.081 --> 08:10.922
Thanks for the pic, Your Highness.
You're welcome.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.323
Willow.

08:16.391 --> 08:18.714
Welcome back. Walk with me.

08:22.268 --> 08:25.448
Considering the new developments
in the succession line,

08:25.557 --> 08:28.401
I've broadened your job
description to the entire family.

08:28.464 --> 08:31.375
Your first task will be to assemble.

08:31.423 --> 08:33.523
A list of candidates for Robert.

08:33.645 --> 08:36.179
Uh...
Candidates, Your Majesty?

08:36.702 --> 08:40.054
Finding the right woman for the
future King takes some calculation.

08:40.546 --> 08:43.354
You know the women in the upper
level of the aristocracy,

08:43.423 --> 08:45.155
and I trust your instincts.

08:45.210 --> 08:46.499
We need to find a girl

08:46.554 --> 08:49.257
Robert and the country
can fall in love with.

08:49.338 --> 08:50.725
Understood?

08:50.811 --> 08:52.694
Of course. Yes.

08:52.888 --> 08:54.588
Good luck.

08:58.765 --> 09:00.238
Ladies and Gentlemen,

09:00.429 --> 09:02.491
Thank you for joining us
this weekend,

09:02.546 --> 09:04.909
for the 72nd People's Gala,

09:04.978 --> 09:06.544
two nights and one day.

09:06.592 --> 09:08.881
Dedicated to making the world
a better place.

09:09.139 --> 09:11.162
This year,
I'm very proud to announce.

09:11.210 --> 09:13.365
A new initiative
to help war veterans.

09:14.354 --> 09:16.220
Gratitude forever.

09:21.514 --> 09:23.662
Together, we can work
to help our veterans.

09:23.710 --> 09:26.725
Integrate back into
daily life after service.

09:26.833 --> 09:30.068
War is hard, but coming home
can be much harder.

09:30.553 --> 09:34.857
I want to recognize someone whose hard
work has made this entire event possible.

09:35.498 --> 09:38.068
My sister Eleanor
has worked tirelessly.

09:38.147 --> 09:40.787
To make this event
cooler than ever.

09:41.084 --> 09:44.378
Every poster, every ticket,
every table design,

09:44.426 --> 09:47.018
has come from
her brilliant brain.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.659
Now, as is customary,
the whole Royal family.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.527
Has put our time
on the auction block.

09:56.611 --> 10:00.346
And this year, we're reinstating
a boxing main event.

10:00.573 --> 10:02.214
Where's Liam?

10:02.284 --> 10:04.335
Join me on stage, little brother.

10:07.911 --> 10:09.277
Put 'em up, Sparrow.

10:09.409 --> 10:11.454
Be careful,
I've got the longer reach.

10:14.485 --> 10:17.665
Thank you again for coming,
and please enjoy the palace.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.610
And everything it has to offer.

10:19.727 --> 10:23.915
But do remember to spend
generously tomorrow. Thank you.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.828
Is everything alright?
Yeah, I'm fine.

10:30.897 --> 10:33.731
Look, it's for charity. I'm just
trying to give them a good show.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.680
Fine.
I'll smile for the cameras.

10:35.977 --> 10:37.352
But I won't play your fool.

10:37.579 --> 10:39.095
So you give them a good show,

10:39.227 --> 10:41.321
and I'll give them a good fight.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.236
This place is unreal.

11:01.564 --> 11:03.759
You've seen both princes naked.

11:03.860 --> 11:06.126
But never been to
the palace - that's unreal.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.258
You have to put
a ticket in for Robert.

11:12.306 --> 11:13.671
Tickets are â£300 each.

11:13.719 --> 11:15.753
Then we have to be resourceful.

11:20.486 --> 11:23.018
We'll take one. You don't
have that kind of money.

11:23.134 --> 11:24.600
It's for your birthday.

11:24.810 --> 11:27.314
- And Christmas.
- And your next birthday.

11:27.839 --> 11:30.440
Plus, if we don't win,
I'll just say it was stolen.

11:30.657 --> 11:33.900
Angie! You're right. I'll say it
got stolen even if we do win.

11:34.192 --> 11:35.658
Thanks.

11:36.347 --> 11:37.713

I do wish I could afford
a few tickets.

12:06.526 --> 12:09.191
I'd love to put some in
for King Cyrus's auction.

12:09.239 --> 12:11.915
Well, seeing as it's
a charity event,

12:11.963 --> 12:14.030
it would hardly be charitable.

12:14.123 --> 12:17.066
For me to stand by and not help.

12:17.637 --> 12:20.707
Oh, my gosh! How about we get
a new ticket together?

12:20.772 --> 12:22.772
If our ticket gets pulled,
we'll both go.

Your Highness? I'm Willow.

12:43.072 --> 12:45.064
I was working with Liam
before you returned.

12:45.135 --> 12:47.158
Yes, of course.
Nice to meet you.

12:47.306 --> 12:48.830
Your mother asked if I'd compile.

12:48.878 --> 12:51.078
A list of... candidates.

12:51.299 --> 12:53.174
Would you mind if I asked
you a few questions?

12:53.222 --> 12:55.188
My mother certainly
doesn't waste any time.

12:55.258 --> 12:57.025
I promise,
these won't take long.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.111
Where would you prefer.

12:59.165 --> 13:00.338
A forest, a lake,

13:00.396 --> 13:02.162
a beach, or a Meadow?

13:02.349 --> 13:04.291
Ah! A forest, I suppose.

13:04.752 --> 13:07.213
If you were stranded
on a desert island...

13:08.564 --> 13:10.221
- Okay, we'll skip that one.
- Mm.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.257
You meet a Troll on a bridge.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.233
What do you use to defeat him.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.094
A sword, a stone,

13:16.163 --> 13:18.924
a revolver... or your mind?

13:20.014 --> 13:21.981
Okay. My mind.

13:23.637 --> 13:26.502
A potion gives you animal quality.
Which do you take?

13:26.572 --> 13:27.900
The speed of a hare,

13:27.955 --> 13:29.361
the strength of an ape,

13:29.439 --> 13:31.643
the agility of a cat, or...

13:31.814 --> 13:33.344
The good nature of a dog?

13:33.734 --> 13:35.768
Agility of a cat, of course.

13:37.267 --> 13:40.322
Wow! Only three questions... special.

13:40.494 --> 13:42.156
You're a Gryffindor.

13:42.348 --> 13:43.783
Not that I'm surprised.

13:44.963 --> 13:48.056
- That's all I needed.
- At least I wasn't a hufflepuff.

13:48.111 --> 13:51.296
- What's wrong with hufflepuffs?
- Oh, nothing, I just uh...

13:51.364 --> 13:54.709
Just kidding.
I'm a ravenclaw. Obviously.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.907
Welcome to the People's Gala
Charity Auction.

14:02.967 --> 14:04.545
All money raised today,

14:04.593 --> 14:07.772
goes to Prince Robert's
New Veterans' Charity,

14:07.881 --> 14:09.920
gratitude forever.

14:11.231 --> 14:12.741
Who's ready to win?

14:15.144 --> 14:18.423
The first drawing
is for a Bourbon Tasting,

14:18.492 --> 14:21.629
Avec Moi,
from my private collection.

14:25.349 --> 14:27.599
Charles Wescott and Cindy!

14:28.668 --> 14:31.536
And the next item on the block.

14:31.716 --> 14:34.020
Is for a Lovely Afternoon Tea.

14:34.068 --> 14:38.869
With everyone's favorite
Fairy-Tale villain, Queen Helena.

14:45.587 --> 14:47.774
Mr. Jack Parker.

14:47.994 --> 14:50.897
Please enjoy the fancy scones,

14:51.210 --> 14:52.593
delicious sandwiches,

14:52.641 --> 14:55.968
and the country's best
annoyed eye-rolls.

14:56.960 --> 15:00.390
Up next, a prize
that's been done to death,

15:00.451 --> 15:02.315
Princess Eleanor!

15:02.929 --> 15:06.307
Tabloid joke. Tabloid joke.
I only have one ball.

15:07.292 --> 15:08.995
Speaking of balls,

15:09.044 --> 15:11.964
the winner will get to play
with Eleanor's...

15:12.579 --> 15:16.065
In a game of
Royal Garden Croquet.

15:19.120 --> 15:21.745
Prince Sebastian Idrisi!

15:22.057 --> 15:24.458
It's not exactly
a contact sport,

15:24.558 --> 15:27.386
but I'd still wear
some protection.

15:28.354 --> 15:33.714
And now,
a prize that even Prince Liam,

15:33.798 --> 15:35.276
doesn't want to win

15:35.487 --> 15:38.589
an art viewing with prince Liam,

15:43.076 --> 15:45.597
Oh, my, it's the fair ladies.

15:45.659 --> 15:48.370
That's my ex-wife and her friends.

15:48.479 --> 15:52.675
And finally, for those of you
who are fans of the undead...

15:53.581 --> 15:57.503
A wine-cellar tour with
the Zombie prince himself,

15:57.652 --> 15:59.051
Prince Robert.

16:03.743 --> 16:05.376
Kathryn Davis.

16:15.336 --> 16:17.792
Miss Davis.
Robert Henstridge.

16:18.144 --> 16:20.278
Do you mind if we have
a photo together?

16:20.807 --> 16:22.464
I only bought one ticket.

16:22.565 --> 16:25.325
That must make me the
luckiest man in the world.

16:39.230 --> 16:41.164
I hope your day got better.

16:42.222 --> 16:43.661
It did, thanks.

16:45.653 --> 16:49.872
- What's that all about?
- That is a man with bad Cologne.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.534
I'm coming in!

16:52.445 --> 16:53.964
Whoa.

16:54.012 --> 16:57.883
You think you can just fire
me? You can't treat me like...

16:58.051 --> 16:59.517
oh!

17:01.798 --> 17:03.774
Sorry, Your Highness.
He's not a friend of yours?

17:03.822 --> 17:05.821
No. No. No.

17:28.015 --> 17:30.547
So you're telling me
that a disgruntled employee.

17:30.616 --> 17:32.054
Verbally attacked you, Princess?

17:32.125 --> 17:35.052
Yes. And then a palace
guest assaulted him?

17:35.120 --> 17:36.400
I saw a threat
and took him down.

17:36.455 --> 17:38.121
That man had a lot of training.

17:38.190 --> 17:40.257
He should not have been
so easily neutralized.

17:40.340 --> 17:42.678
Clearly he's never run up
against the Welsh Guard.

17:42.742 --> 17:46.289
Uh... I invited Rosie
with a group of vets tonight.

17:46.337 --> 17:49.031
Other than swearing like a
sailor and cheating at poker,

17:49.104 --> 17:50.890
I can vouch for her character.

17:52.969 --> 17:54.669
That's good enough for me, sir.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.023
You can stay
for the rest of the Gala.

17:57.156 --> 18:00.320
Even if you kicked her out, she'd
probably bash up all your guards.

18:00.376 --> 18:02.312
- Mm.
- Enjoy your night.

18:02.414 --> 18:05.843
And please... let the guards
do the protecting.

18:06.096 --> 18:07.695
Sir.

18:11.457 --> 18:13.490
I trust you're both
enjoying yourselves?

18:13.559 --> 18:14.797
Of course, Your Majesty.

18:14.845 --> 18:19.498
And thank you again for letting me
bring along my uh... assistant, Cindy.

18:19.651 --> 18:22.295
- She's a bourbon connoisseur.
- Mm.

18:29.679 --> 18:33.414
I'm terribly sorry, but I'm
afraid I must step out.

18:33.505 --> 18:34.805
King stuff.

18:34.913 --> 18:37.714
But please,
stay as long as you'd like,

18:37.783 --> 18:39.225
enjoy my bourbon.

18:39.548 --> 18:42.795
Just let the footman know when
you'd like to return to the Gala.

18:54.147 --> 18:55.613
No!

18:55.839 --> 18:58.039
But I wanted to thank you
for today.

18:58.248 --> 19:01.869
You've been so... generous.

19:01.987 --> 19:03.753
We... really shouldn't.

19:03.939 --> 19:04.994
Nonsense.

19:05.042 --> 19:09.010
We have the afternoon
and a bed fit for a king.

19:09.283 --> 19:12.616
And I happen to have
a few party favors.

19:13.485 --> 19:15.486
Now it's my turn to be generous.

19:15.568 --> 19:17.835
I'm not sure
you'll appreciate...

19:19.391 --> 19:21.846
My particular tastes.

19:22.728 --> 19:24.094
Try me.

19:31.370 --> 19:34.588
All right. Croquet.
How do we play?

19:35.441 --> 19:38.072
Honestly? I thought you'd know.

19:38.243 --> 19:41.778
I just assumed that "Croquet
with Princess Eleanor".

19:41.847 --> 19:43.547
Would mean that Princess Eleanor,

19:43.615 --> 19:45.178
would know how to play Croquet.

19:46.194 --> 19:50.256
Yeah, it's probably best you
don't assume things with me.

19:50.722 --> 19:54.194
Besides, I don't think anybody
really knows how to play Croquet.

19:54.291 --> 19:56.791
Okay.
Let's make up our own game.

19:57.936 --> 20:01.164
Whoever gets a ball into the
statue's mouth gets a point.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.405
And if you make a shot,

20:03.480 --> 20:05.913
then the other person
has to take a shot.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.147
This game's getting better
already.

20:10.913 --> 20:13.983
So you never told me you
styled this weekend's events.

20:14.089 --> 20:15.811
Nice work, Your Highness.

20:16.548 --> 20:18.600
It's been a nice distraction.

20:19.818 --> 20:22.999
I'm kind of... dealing with
a difficult break-up.

20:24.223 --> 20:25.789
Off the record.

20:25.913 --> 20:27.257
I'm sorry to hear that.

20:28.558 --> 20:30.759
I decided to love someone.

20:30.905 --> 20:33.530
And it was scary and confusing.

20:34.186 --> 20:35.389
But so thrilling.

20:35.452 --> 20:38.733
And then... it wasn't.

20:40.904 --> 20:42.437
This is recent?

20:43.242 --> 20:44.608
Yeah.

20:44.676 --> 20:46.967
Well, you seem to be doing
pretty good.

20:47.934 --> 20:49.600
It's all a facade.

20:51.650 --> 20:53.725
A lifetime
of showing the world...

20:54.419 --> 20:56.186
Only what they want to see.

20:56.388 --> 20:58.255
I'm not doing that good at all.

20:58.364 --> 21:00.044
But you're here,

21:00.126 --> 21:02.419
and sometimes
just showing up is enough.

21:03.658 --> 21:05.157
Thanks.

21:06.567 --> 21:09.653
It's for charity, you know?
And it's for my dad.

21:11.294 --> 21:15.692
Well. Having been in a couple of
treacherous break-ups myself,

21:15.934 --> 21:18.059
I have a couple of secrets
to share with you.

21:18.307 --> 21:19.706
Oh, yeah?

21:20.614 --> 21:23.575
The Sun still rises
and the world doesn't end.

21:24.096 --> 21:25.638
And one day it gets better.

21:26.418 --> 21:29.319
- Are you sure?
- Absolutely sure.

21:29.724 --> 21:32.349
Eventually, you even smile.

21:32.732 --> 21:35.099
- Whoa!
- I'm serious.

21:35.427 --> 21:37.127
Color me dubious.

21:38.753 --> 21:41.966
Whoa! And a smile.

21:46.747 --> 21:49.622
- Thanks for letting me talk about that.
- It gets better.

21:49.740 --> 21:51.573
It just takes a while.

21:52.399 --> 21:54.600
Off the record.

22:00.359 --> 22:01.880
Oh, Liam!

22:01.982 --> 22:03.294
Darling!

22:03.349 --> 22:05.989
Let me introduce
the fair ladies.

22:06.058 --> 22:07.357
Lady Elaine,

22:07.482 --> 22:09.659
lady Marion, and lady Jane.

22:09.728 --> 22:13.096
Ladies, the pleasure is all mine.
Shall we start the art tour?

22:13.165 --> 22:15.833
Darling, I don't want
to see any art.

22:15.943 --> 22:17.867
Not unless your body's
the paintbrush.

22:17.936 --> 22:20.203
And mine's the canvas.

22:20.872 --> 22:22.732
Oh, just relax
and have a drink with us.

22:22.802 --> 22:24.735
Who wants some bubbly?

22:24.888 --> 22:28.545
You know, back in the day, I won
an auction for your grandfather.

22:28.614 --> 22:31.672
I tell you, I would have let that
silver fox have his wicked way with me.

22:31.720 --> 22:33.550
Right there on the Croquet lawn.

22:33.619 --> 22:35.819
Jane!
It's the boy's grandfather!

22:35.887 --> 22:37.020
Oh, hush!

22:37.089 --> 22:39.823
He doesn't mind.
That's why we picked him.

22:39.891 --> 22:41.558
He knows how to have fun.

22:41.627 --> 22:43.259
Mm. So what's the gossip?

22:43.307 --> 22:45.673
What really happened with
Gemma Kensington?

22:45.767 --> 22:48.164
You know,
her mother was just mortified.

22:48.233 --> 22:50.033
When it didn't work out
between you two.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.135
Serves her right -
she's a bitch.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.646
Not Gemma, her mother.

22:53.743 --> 22:55.701
Well... both actually.

22:57.920 --> 23:00.481
So, are you excited
to get into that ring tonight.

23:00.512 --> 23:03.813
And face off against your
brother like two sexy warriors,

23:03.890 --> 23:04.989
the sweat glistening off...

23:05.050 --> 23:07.094
That's enough, Marion.

23:07.252 --> 23:10.186
It's just a charity
exhibition. All good fun.

23:10.255 --> 23:11.821
Oh, come on.

23:12.322 --> 23:13.688
Okay, fine.

23:13.906 --> 23:15.825
I want to kick his ass.

23:15.894 --> 23:17.578
That's the spirit!

23:18.345 --> 23:21.246
- Now, take off your shirt.
- Cheers!

23:22.567 --> 23:24.434
I can't believe I won.

23:24.703 --> 23:27.381
I had a feeling that luck
might be on your side.

23:27.881 --> 23:31.274
If I can't arrange a charity auction, I
don't deserve to be king of anywhere.

23:32.277 --> 23:35.374
You said you'd never tasted one!

23:35.480 --> 23:38.071
I would have said anything
to meet you.

23:41.594 --> 23:44.705
What is this?
Why did you set this up?

23:46.091 --> 23:48.157
Because you hated the secrecy.

23:48.872 --> 23:51.078
And this is a way of
introducing you to the public,

23:51.149 --> 23:53.578
without the press
clamoring for a story.

23:53.836 --> 23:55.813
Because they've already.

23:55.946 --> 23:57.634
Cinderella.

23:57.703 --> 23:59.602
They won't look past that.

24:00.157 --> 24:02.138
So it's a stunt?

24:02.594 --> 24:05.594
No, it's a story that we
don't have to hide from.

24:06.344 --> 24:10.102
Look, I know it's a lot, but we can
deal with the press stuff later.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.344
Right now,
I just want to be with you.

24:13.785 --> 24:15.351
Here.

24:18.769 --> 24:20.368
Like this.

24:27.452 --> 24:29.938
- I heard the whole about you.
- Mr. Parker.

24:30.719 --> 24:34.055
The charming, fabulously
wealthy American investor.

24:34.237 --> 24:35.305
Hm.

24:36.844 --> 24:39.055
You shouldn't believe
everything you hear, Ma'am.

24:39.103 --> 24:41.259
Except those things. Hey're true.

24:41.391 --> 24:45.087
Well, despite what you've cooked
up in your billionaire brain,

24:45.212 --> 24:47.601
this is not some some of
Pay-to-Date situation.

24:47.669 --> 24:52.524
Of course not. I wanted to meet you
because I'm fascinated by the Monarchy.

24:52.746 --> 24:54.079
Bollocks.

24:59.149 --> 25:02.555
They say you have
impeccable luck, Mr. Parker.

25:02.649 --> 25:05.085
Everything you touch
seems to turn to gold.

25:05.154 --> 25:07.555
I've only ever gotten lucky once...

25:07.656 --> 25:09.782
the day I was born with
my instincts.

25:10.125 --> 25:14.094
If I can trust those,
I almost never lose.

25:14.379 --> 25:16.179
I'm told you're the same.

25:16.477 --> 25:18.465
You didn't luck into
being born a Royal.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.802
You were born with
killer instincts,

25:22.001 --> 25:25.376
and that's why I wanted
to meet you... Your Majesty.

25:42.780 --> 25:46.319
What did baby do?
Baby made a mess.

25:47.405 --> 25:49.496
Yes, he most certainly did.

25:49.604 --> 25:51.431
Your Majesty!

25:51.500 --> 25:53.104
Listen, I was just...

25:53.152 --> 25:55.068
Ingesting Peruvian cocaine.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.674
And wearing a nappy
in the King's Bedroom.

25:57.838 --> 25:59.773
Thanks,
but I don't need a recap.

25:59.842 --> 26:03.143
If I want the gory details,
I'll watch the tape.

26:03.377 --> 26:06.213
Cindy, will you give us
a moment?

26:08.568 --> 26:11.469
Now, then. Mr. Wescott.

26:16.582 --> 26:19.893
I heard a rumor
that you're the lead MP.

26:19.962 --> 26:22.575
On the Privy Council
selection committee.

26:22.627 --> 26:24.247
Congratulations.

26:24.666 --> 26:27.340
Big responsibility,
selecting the ones,

26:27.388 --> 26:30.223
who will select
the country's next king.

26:30.672 --> 26:34.036
Oh, relax. I'm here to help.

26:34.567 --> 26:39.832
Have a drink. I saved
the best bourbon for last.

26:40.153 --> 26:42.622
18-year-old single barrel.

26:45.153 --> 26:48.301
Might even be older than
the girl who spanked you.

26:49.892 --> 26:51.091
Now, then.

26:51.159 --> 26:53.660
I'd love to see
what the book has to say

26:53.729 --> 26:55.793
about your actions here today.

26:56.012 --> 26:57.344
You?

26:58.379 --> 26:59.825
I'd advise you, then,

26:59.895 --> 27:02.736
to lean towards MPs
who appreciate a King

27:02.804 --> 27:04.840
who places less value
on the book.

27:04.942 --> 27:07.918
And more value
on... discretion.

27:08.143 --> 27:12.434
So nobody has to find out what
a naughty baby you've been.

27:12.714 --> 27:16.715
Now, put some clothes on,
Wescott, you freak.

27:21.781 --> 27:23.514
Can I tell you the truth?

27:23.981 --> 27:26.973
This was the part of the Gala weekend
that I was dreading the most.

27:27.325 --> 27:29.296
Most women dread
spending time with me,

27:29.364 --> 27:31.064
even when it is for charity.

27:31.133 --> 27:34.520
Yeah, well, somehow,
I don't think that's true.

27:34.609 --> 27:35.684
I'm serious.

27:35.732 --> 27:38.411
I could have totally saved a
Leper Colony once, but nope.

27:38.640 --> 27:40.240
No takers.

27:43.191 --> 27:45.785
I have a problem
trusting people...

27:46.700 --> 27:49.001
Giving people
the benefit of the doubt.

27:49.886 --> 27:51.402
Historically...

27:52.051 --> 27:55.027
Letting new people in
has not served me well.

27:55.441 --> 27:57.416
Most people
still know right from wrong.

27:57.464 --> 27:59.582
And they still want to put
some good in the world.

27:59.855 --> 28:03.098
Hey! Whoa. How can you
possibly be like this?

28:03.176 --> 28:05.613
You are Royal, correct?

28:05.834 --> 28:08.768
I am, yes,
but I'm seventh in line.

28:08.837 --> 28:12.730
An awful lot would have to go wrong for
me to occupy the kingdom's throne.

28:13.275 --> 28:16.943
Instead, I get to live ridiculously
well without all the pressure of it.

28:17.121 --> 28:18.512
So do I.

28:18.871 --> 28:21.824
Hm. Yours is a little
different, though.

28:21.926 --> 28:23.516
Your visibility's higher.

28:23.585 --> 28:26.035
I try to keep things
more low-key.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.652
You just bought an island.

28:29.024 --> 28:31.625
I googled you.
That is not low-key.

28:31.693 --> 28:35.061
I want to build something
beyond just being Royal,

28:35.109 --> 28:37.362
have a life that matters.
Leave a mark.

28:37.933 --> 28:40.500
- Make the world better.
- I hope so.

28:41.203 --> 28:44.901
And you do, too, or you wouldn't
be here now, or this weekend.
