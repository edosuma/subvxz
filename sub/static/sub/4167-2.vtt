00:01.952 --> 00:03.662
<i>Previously on</i> Weeds...

00:03.746 --> 00:05.206
Give me that fucking thing.

00:05.289 --> 00:07.166
There aren't any bullets in it.

00:07.249 --> 00:10.503
Don't come out of here,
no matter what. Don't come out.

00:10.586 --> 00:12.880
If she doesn't find the pot,
ain't nobody getting shit!

00:12.963 --> 00:14.673
Guns on me. I stay.

00:14.757 --> 00:16.550
Man, this is the fucking police station.

00:16.634 --> 00:18.803
- Where is it?
- It's all in the trunk of my car.

00:18.886 --> 00:21.680
<i>- The car that Celia's driving?
- That would be it.</i>

00:21.764 --> 00:23.808
<i>He's my nephew,
I called in an AMBER Alert.</i>

00:23.891 --> 00:26.268
She left with Bear, and then
the kid drove a blue van

00:26.352 --> 00:28.562
around the parking lot
for an hour before taking off.

00:28.646 --> 00:29.814
Come on, we gotta jam!

00:30.606 --> 00:31.857
We're having a great time.

00:31.941 --> 00:33.734
We're gonna grab some dinner,
then we'll be home.

00:33.818 --> 00:36.278
- 50 cent on the dollar. Final offer.
- Fine.

00:36.362 --> 00:39.198
- Your ass and your grass is all his now.
- Shit.

00:39.281 --> 00:40.991
Silas's phone.

00:42.368 --> 00:44.328
I borrowed some garden shears.

00:44.412 --> 00:48.999
- You know, they were really helpful.
- He gonna be mad.

00:55.840 --> 00:58.551
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

00:58.634 --> 01:01.262
<i># Little boxes made of ticky-tacky</i>

01:01.345 --> 01:03.889
<i># Little boxes on the hillside</i>

01:03.973 --> 01:06.475
<i># Little boxes all the same</i>

01:06.559 --> 01:09.228
<i># There's a green one and a pink one</i>

01:09.311 --> 01:12.106
<i># And a blue one and a yellow one</i>

01:12.189 --> 01:14.692
<i># And they're all made out of ticky-tacky</i>

01:14.775 --> 01:18.612
<i>- # And they all look just the same
- # Ticky-tacky, ticky-tacky hum</i>

01:18.696 --> 01:23.951
<i># And they all play on the golf course
and drink their martini dry</i>

01:24.034 --> 01:29.457
<i># And they all have pretty children
and the children go to school</i>

01:29.540 --> 01:34.628
<i># And the children go to summer camp
and then to university</i>

01:34.712 --> 01:37.423
<i># Where they're all put in boxes</i>

01:37.506 --> 01:43.471
<i>- # And they all look just the same
- # Ticky-tacky, ticky-tacky hum #</i>

01:50.102 --> 01:53.147
I did this for you, Nancy.

01:54.940 --> 01:58.152
You should be thanking me
for not having you arrested.

02:01.906 --> 02:04.158
Hi, I'm Celia.

02:04.241 --> 02:05.993
- And you are?
- Marvin.

02:06.077 --> 02:09.080
Are you one of Nancy's
drug dealer friends?

02:10.038 --> 02:11.207
No.

02:11.499 --> 02:14.126
No, he's not my friend.

02:14.710 --> 02:16.378
He's gonna kill me.

02:16.462 --> 02:18.589
Isn't that right, Marvin?

02:18.672 --> 02:21.300
But please, do me this one last favour.

02:21.383 --> 02:25.346
Kill her, too. First. In front of me. Please.

02:25.429 --> 02:29.141
No one will know it was you.
Just blow her fucking brains out.

02:29.225 --> 02:32.311
And let me watch, and then
you can do whatever you want to me.

02:32.394 --> 02:35.648
- She's just kidding.
- No, no, not kidding. Here.

02:35.731 --> 02:39.693
If you throw that fucking rock at me,
I am going straight to the police,

02:39.777 --> 02:43.197
and you can rot in jail with Silas.

02:44.615 --> 02:47.159
I am trying to help you.

02:54.125 --> 02:56.210
We just know each other
from the grocery store.

02:56.293 --> 02:59.004
- I'm a bagger, and...
- Bullshit.

02:59.088 --> 03:04.468
Like there is an obese black bag boy
at any market in a 30-mile range of here.

03:04.552 --> 03:09.723
In Agrestic, the people are white,
and the help is brown, not black.

03:09.807 --> 03:11.016
You know, you're nasty.

03:11.100 --> 03:13.018
Get the fuck out of my yard!

03:13.102 --> 03:15.646
OK, I can see that you're upset.

03:16.564 --> 03:19.525
Being a drug dealer
that's just been caught and all.

03:19.608 --> 03:22.653
Well, this must be
very embarrassing for you.

03:22.945 --> 03:26.323
I'll come back
when you've had a chance to think,

03:26.615 --> 03:28.284
and we'll talk.

03:29.201 --> 03:34.623
And if you need a pool man,
I have a really great guy.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.923
Holy shit!

03:43.007 --> 03:44.467
That's one crazy bitch!

03:44.550 --> 03:46.051
You think she's gonna tell?

03:46.135 --> 03:47.470
No way.

03:47.553 --> 03:50.264
She'd never wanna give up
having this over me.

03:50.347 --> 03:53.309
- Grab the other skimmer and help me.
- I don't think this is gonna work, Nancy.

03:53.392 --> 03:55.019
Marvin, I don't need your

03:55.102 --> 03:59.273
fucking negativity right now,
just grab the fucking pole and skim!

04:01.066 --> 04:02.359
Nancy,

04:03.360 --> 04:06.697
I will kill your boy with pain.

04:06.781 --> 04:09.450
As it is, I just might have to kick him

04:09.533 --> 04:12.036
in his kidney because you ain't here yet.

04:14.580 --> 04:16.665
Next one goes in his fucking head.

04:16.749 --> 04:19.709
I don't appreciate
being inconvenienced like that.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.296
Now, put Marvin back
on the goddamn phone.

04:24.381 --> 04:27.301
Yo. With or without the jahooby,

04:27.384 --> 04:30.262
you and her get back here by nine o'clock,
you understand me?

04:30.346 --> 04:33.265
Light a fire under that bitch's ass.
I'm getting cranky.

04:35.893 --> 04:38.312
Ho-sa.

04:42.858 --> 04:46.987
- Why are you so quiet?
- Why are you pointing a gun at my head?

04:47.530 --> 04:49.115
Oh, I'm sorry...

04:49.698 --> 04:50.991
friend.

04:56.622 --> 04:58.290
Is that better?

04:59.291 --> 05:00.459
No?

05:05.047 --> 05:07.883
- How about now?
- I ain't playing, Louis.

05:16.308 --> 05:18.018
All you gotta do is snatch it.

05:18.102 --> 05:20.104
You might be quicker than I think.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.565
But what happens
when you got the gun, farmer?

05:22.648 --> 05:24.567
You think you could end me?

05:24.650 --> 05:27.236
You think you got any thug in you?

05:28.154 --> 05:31.699
Come on, Farmer Brown, end this shit now.

05:41.584 --> 05:42.793
See!

05:43.169 --> 05:48.215
That's the shit right there that makes
me owe Marvin a fucking flat screen.

05:48.716 --> 05:51.677
Can't pick up the gun when it counts!

05:52.011 --> 05:54.930
Can't fuck the white bitch
when she's right in front of you!

05:55.014 --> 05:56.348
We're just friends.

05:56.432 --> 06:00.978
- Yeah! Marvin said you all kissed.
- What you want me to say, Louis?

06:01.061 --> 06:03.814
You bust in here, try to rip me off,

06:04.565 --> 06:06.400
hold me hostage, threaten to kill me...

06:06.484 --> 06:08.569
Bitch, bitch, bitch.

06:08.652 --> 06:11.489
You should be kissing my ass in spades.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.699
Cos instead of owing them
hummus-eating motherfuckers,

06:13.783 --> 06:14.825
you only owe me.

06:14.909 --> 06:16.827
Oh, no, see, Nancy's gonna
bring the weed back here,

06:16.911 --> 06:19.246
and then we don't owe you nothing.

06:19.330 --> 06:21.457
And I don't want nothing
to do with you after.

06:21.540 --> 06:25.294
OK! Now, see, now you just
hurtin' my feelings.

06:26.545 --> 06:29.298
I just wanted to know how she kisses.

06:30.299 --> 06:33.803
She look like she kisses real sweet.

06:33.886 --> 06:37.765
Cut the shit, cos it's getting old real fast.

06:37.848 --> 06:39.141
I tell you what.

06:39.225 --> 06:42.103
I let you keep a couple bricks of that pot...

06:43.270 --> 06:45.189
if you let me fuck her

06:45.272 --> 06:48.109
on this corner.

06:48.317 --> 06:49.860
Right here.

06:50.486 --> 06:53.030
I mean, seeing as
the two of you just kissed,

06:53.114 --> 06:55.074
I don't see you having a problem with that.

06:57.535 --> 07:00.246
- Shit.
- What the fuck was that?

07:02.039 --> 07:03.666
What the fuck?

07:06.961 --> 07:08.546
Yo, bitch in the closet!

07:08.629 --> 07:12.258
- Uh-huh.
- Open it. Open real wide.

07:18.973 --> 07:20.349
I'm gay.

07:25.146 --> 07:26.147
Well?

07:26.230 --> 07:27.982
Microwave wrecked everything.

07:28.065 --> 07:30.818
And the stuff in the oven
just kind of stuck together in a clump.

07:30.901 --> 07:32.486
Well, will you get in here and try this?

07:32.570 --> 07:35.322
- What you got to smoke it with?
- I don't know, I don't have a bowl.

07:35.406 --> 07:37.324
- I'm not really a smoker.
- Seriously?

07:37.408 --> 07:39.702
- Control issues.
- You got soda in a can?

07:39.785 --> 07:42.288
There's Diet Coke in the fridge.
Just dump it in the sink.

07:42.371 --> 07:44.623
- You got root beer?
- Does it matter?

07:44.707 --> 07:46.500
I like root beer, I'm thirsty.

07:46.584 --> 07:51.338
Just try the pot first, then you can
raid the fridge for whatever you want.

07:54.717 --> 07:57.344
- Hello.
- You want a plate for that?

07:58.220 --> 08:00.347
Thank God.
I thought you were Shane and Andy.

08:00.431 --> 08:04.143
Listen, what setting do you think is best for
drying pot that's been in the swimming pool?

08:04.226 --> 08:06.812
Are you trying to make
some hash or something?

08:06.896 --> 08:08.856
Because I don't think this is how you do it.

08:11.358 --> 08:15.738
Oh, yeah, you and me,
we're doing our jobs.

08:15.821 --> 08:18.282
Doing 'em, doing 'em right.

08:21.827 --> 08:23.746
Hey, it's the "Drugs Are Wrong" lady!

08:23.829 --> 08:25.456
Hey, kids.

08:25.539 --> 08:28.584
That's right.
That's me.

08:28.667 --> 08:30.628
Getting recognised.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.172
Drugs are wrong.

08:33.255 --> 08:36.549
And it feels so right
to not do them.

08:36.634 --> 08:38.803
Just throw them away.

08:38.885 --> 08:42.264
I'm a crusader, you know?

08:42.347 --> 08:45.226
Could you move? You're blocking the goal.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.145
Crusader.

08:50.106 --> 08:53.818
Celia Hodes!
Doing it pro bono!

08:55.319 --> 08:57.571
Not asking for... accolades.

08:59.365 --> 09:00.574
Turning my ankle.

09:03.411 --> 09:06.163
Oh, man, that's fucking awful!

09:06.247 --> 09:09.417
It's like all harsh and no high!
It's wrecked. We fucked.

09:09.500 --> 09:13.129
- Come on, let's go see U-Turn.
- You said we had until nine o'clock.

09:13.212 --> 09:15.798
You gonna grow a new crop
between now and nine?

09:15.881 --> 09:17.842
- Let's go.
- No!

09:17.925 --> 09:20.386
Saying no to me is not a good idea.

09:20.469 --> 09:23.889
Look, I think you're cool and all,
but I will hurt you. I'm a thug, that's what I do!

09:23.973 --> 09:26.225
- I think you need to go with him.
- No, wait! Wait!

09:26.308 --> 09:28.227
I have one more idea.

09:28.853 --> 09:30.396
No, listen!

09:31.355 --> 09:34.191
Best case,
we actually show up with something.

09:34.275 --> 09:38.154
Worst case, you deliver me on time.
What have you got to lose?

09:38.237 --> 09:41.115
Hey, I didn't bring back the right thing
from 7-Eleven once.

09:41.198 --> 09:43.200
Now I got an artificial patella.

09:43.284 --> 09:46.036
- Man, I'm out of here!
- Marvin, please. Marvin!

09:46.746 --> 09:48.080
Look!

09:48.164 --> 09:51.125
Give me one more chance
to make this right.

09:51.208 --> 09:52.626
Please.

09:55.588 --> 09:56.839
Shit!

10:00.926 --> 10:02.261
Hello?

10:03.012 --> 10:04.847
What? He's where?

10:04.930 --> 10:07.057
Thank God! Yeah! Great!

10:07.975 --> 10:09.727
I'll come get him.

10:10.227 --> 10:11.228
Yeah.

10:12.730 --> 10:15.107
Tell him Uncle Andy's coming to get him.

10:15.191 --> 10:18.068
Great, thank you so much.
Thank you, Officer.

10:33.584 --> 10:34.668
Whoo-hoo!

10:34.752 --> 10:36.587
Was that a great party or what?

10:36.670 --> 10:39.757
How would you know?
You spent the whole time in the bathroom.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.885
I'm sorry, honey. I was just working
some stuff out with your Uncle Doug.

10:42.968 --> 10:45.763
That's all right. You weren't even
the most embarrassing parent there.

10:45.846 --> 10:48.057
Martha Straley's mom
wasn't wearing any underwear

10:48.140 --> 10:50.559
and fell over an ottoman
while doing the cha-cha slide,

10:50.643 --> 10:53.187
- and everyone saw.
- I'm sorry I missed that.

10:53.270 --> 10:57.650
- Hey, can we make hot fudge sundaes?
- Oh, my God, that's the best idea ever.

11:01.821 --> 11:03.406
- Dad...
- Yeah, hon?

11:03.489 --> 11:05.324
Mom's passed out in the atrium.

11:11.455 --> 11:13.499
Mom? Mom!

11:13.582 --> 11:15.584
I'm a winner.

11:15.668 --> 11:17.211
Hi, sweetie.

11:17.795 --> 11:19.964
How was the rest of your party?

11:21.799 --> 11:24.051
What the hell you doing here, Celia?

11:26.011 --> 11:27.221
I was...

11:27.304 --> 11:29.849
I just wanted to pick up a few things,

11:29.932 --> 11:33.727
but I couldn't get in
cos all the doors were locked.

11:35.438 --> 11:37.940
And it's been a really long day.

11:38.482 --> 11:40.860
- I bet.
- Could I just...

11:43.988 --> 11:45.406
Do you think...

11:46.907 --> 11:48.576
I could take a bath?

11:48.743 --> 11:52.663
My motel just has a shower,
and I really could use a bath.

11:53.622 --> 11:54.874
Fine.

11:55.541 --> 11:57.960
Take a bath, then please go.

12:00.379 --> 12:03.215
Could you unlock
the door to the bedroom?

12:14.059 --> 12:15.811
Son of a bitch.

12:15.895 --> 12:18.397
So, you want another man's dick up
your ass, that's what you telling me?

12:18.481 --> 12:22.151
Well, I don't know,
I've never tried that. I just...

12:22.234 --> 12:25.946
- I think I've always liked boys.
- I thought you was in love with Nancy.

12:26.030 --> 12:30.618
- Now, who we talking about, Conrad?
- I think that was a...

12:30.701 --> 12:34.288
Judy Garland, Joan Crawford,
Sarah Jessica Parker kind of love.

12:34.371 --> 12:36.707
So, you'll suck a dick?

12:36.791 --> 12:39.251
Yes, I think I would, if it was the right dick.

12:39.335 --> 12:40.836
Ain't no right dick!

12:40.920 --> 12:43.464
All dick besides your own is wrong, boy.

12:43.547 --> 12:45.382
You know, you need Jesus!

12:45.466 --> 12:48.594
No, I think I just need
to admit to myself what I am,

12:48.677 --> 12:53.182
what I've always been, no matter what you,
or my family, or anyone thinks.

12:53.265 --> 12:54.892
So let me just ask you this.

12:54.975 --> 12:57.436
- You ever fuck a girl?
- Excellent question.

12:57.520 --> 12:59.897
Any pussy in your past?

12:59.980 --> 13:04.568
My cousin Reshma had this friend Meetah
who let me play with her nipples.

13:04.652 --> 13:08.030
- I found it kind of gross.
- Yeah, some women got ugly titties.

13:08.114 --> 13:10.199
That don't mean you're a cock smoker.

13:14.120 --> 13:17.623
Hey. I got your lemonade,
but I ain't add cayenne,

13:17.706 --> 13:19.166
cos I ain't know how much.

13:19.250 --> 13:21.460
But I brought it so you could add it.

13:22.378 --> 13:25.089
- Who got the tuna melt?
- Tuna melt's mine.

13:25.673 --> 13:28.050
Well, look at you.

13:28.134 --> 13:29.552
Do I know you?

13:29.635 --> 13:32.763
- You work for U-Turn?
- He do now!

13:32.847 --> 13:34.932
- Oh, I don't think so.
- Oh, no?

13:35.683 --> 13:38.185
Well, shit.
U- Turn, if you're gonna fuck him up,

13:38.269 --> 13:40.688
leave that pretty face, would you?

13:40.771 --> 13:44.859
- Turkey on whole wheat.
- Oh, that's me. Is there mustard?

13:44.942 --> 13:46.569
Should be on there.

13:46.652 --> 13:49.488
- Clinique, let me holler at you for a second.
- What?

13:49.572 --> 13:52.116
Get your ass over here, now!

13:56.871 --> 13:59.206
What do you think they're talking about?

13:59.290 --> 14:01.167
Look, I need to get the fuck out of here.

14:01.250 --> 14:03.586
I'm gonna grab U-Turn and put a gun
to his head, and you need...

14:03.669 --> 14:06.005
I think they're talking about me!

14:06.088 --> 14:08.299
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

14:09.091 --> 14:10.760
- Just nothing, nothing.
- Yo!

14:10.843 --> 14:12.470
Hurry up and finish that sandwich.

14:12.553 --> 14:16.390
Clinique here gonna take you in
the other room and fuck the gay out of you.

14:17.641 --> 14:19.268
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

14:19.351 --> 14:21.061
Man...

14:21.145 --> 14:24.648
- I don't think it works that way.
- Clinique gonna make it work!

14:24.732 --> 14:27.067
You sure you don't think you a faggot?

14:27.151 --> 14:29.111
Positive. Thank you, though.

14:29.195 --> 14:31.113
OK, dinner's over.

14:31.197 --> 14:34.325
The two of you,
get in that room and get busy.

14:38.454 --> 14:41.624
OK, baby, take your pants off,
let's see what you got.

14:41.707 --> 14:44.418
Oh, God, help me!

14:44.502 --> 14:47.129
- And where is Conrad?
- He's at the grow house.

14:47.213 --> 14:50.049
- Damn, this is some good pie!
- You enjoy now,

14:50.132 --> 14:53.260
cos if anything happen to my nephew,
you gonna be eating through a tube.

14:53.344 --> 14:55.554
Hey, I'm just an employee!

14:55.638 --> 14:57.932
- I ain't management.
- Could you people keep it down?

14:58.015 --> 14:59.850
I just got the baby asleep.

14:59.934 --> 15:01.310
- Marvin?
- Vaneeta?

15:01.393 --> 15:03.479
Holy shit, how you doing?

15:04.230 --> 15:06.690
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

15:06.774 --> 15:07.775
Really?

15:07.858 --> 15:10.486
Would you have done it yourself
or hired Armenians?

15:11.237 --> 15:13.864
Oh, I don't know
what the fuck you talking about.

15:13.948 --> 15:16.617
You fucked this up and you know it.

15:20.246 --> 15:21.914
I had it under control!

15:21.997 --> 15:25.668
And then without consulting anyone,
completely outside the huddle,

15:25.751 --> 15:28.379
you made this deal, and that was a mistake.

15:28.462 --> 15:31.090
Your mistake,
and you need to make it right!

15:31.173 --> 15:33.634
So you need to gather up

15:33.717 --> 15:36.262
all the weed in this house,

15:36.345 --> 15:40.641
and we need to take it to U-Turn,
that's what the fuck I'm talking about!

15:40.724 --> 15:42.685
- Oh!
- Ooh, shit!

15:42.768 --> 15:46.355
You gonna come in my house
and drop blame on me?

15:46.439 --> 15:47.481
Me?

15:47.565 --> 15:48.774
Oh, God!

15:48.858 --> 15:50.484
Oh, hell no, bitch!

15:50.568 --> 15:52.695
Get the fuck off me!

15:54.488 --> 15:55.990
You think you can take me?

15:56.073 --> 15:58.033
Ow! She fucking bit me!

15:58.117 --> 15:59.452
Jesus, do something!

15:59.535 --> 16:02.621
Bitch,
have you lost your goddamn mind?

16:02.705 --> 16:04.832
Ohh! What the fuck?

16:05.708 --> 16:07.376
Fine, you all go kill each other!

16:07.460 --> 16:09.879
I'll go back to U-Turn
and say the shit's gone,

16:09.962 --> 16:14.008
and you all can both visit pieces of Conrad
all over the county! I'm outta here.

16:14.091 --> 16:16.343
Wait, what are you talking about Conrad?

16:16.427 --> 16:18.137
What the fuck is going on in here?

16:22.725 --> 16:24.560
Hey, hey, hey...

16:34.779 --> 16:36.489
Oh, this is serious!

16:38.908 --> 16:41.077
Let's go. Let's go!

16:47.416 --> 16:48.459
Ohh!

16:48.542 --> 16:50.628
Thanks for the bath.

16:50.711 --> 16:52.463
Sure.

16:53.964 --> 16:54.965
I'm gonna go.

16:58.260 --> 16:59.470
Bye.

17:04.683 --> 17:06.227
<i>If you're out on the road tonight,</i>

17:06.310 --> 17:09.730
<i>be on the lookout
for a 1972 Ford Supervan,</i>

17:09.814 --> 17:13.901
<i>California license plate number 51 SB310.</i>

17:13.983 --> 17:15.819
<i>And be sure to tune in tonight at eleven,</i>

17:15.903 --> 17:21.075
<i>when the Channel 10 News looks into
the hidden poisons in your vitamins.</i>

17:32.420 --> 17:33.712
Hello!

17:34.547 --> 17:36.882
So you like little boys, huh?

17:36.966 --> 17:40.886
What? The AMBER Alert? Yeah.

17:40.970 --> 17:43.013
- He's my nephew.
- Do you hear that?

17:43.097 --> 17:45.266
He abducted his own nephew.

17:45.349 --> 17:47.685
No, no, I'm the one who called it in.

17:47.768 --> 17:50.646
- What are you doing in the vehicle?
- And where's the little boy?

17:50.729 --> 17:53.107
He must be tied up in the back.

17:53.190 --> 17:57.027
- Look, he's buying chocolate milk.
- No! I like chocolate milk.

17:57.111 --> 17:59.029
I'm rejuvenile.

17:59.113 --> 18:01.615
Yeah, the police have him.
I'm on my way to pick him up.

18:01.699 --> 18:05.745
Bullshit! I just saw the AMBER Alert
not five minutes ago out on the highway.

18:05.828 --> 18:09.290
If the police had him, they'd
have called it off. That's what they do.

18:09.373 --> 18:13.002
Maybe they forgot, I don't know.
Call them. Ask them yourselves.

18:13.085 --> 18:14.128
We'll do that.

18:14.211 --> 18:16.672
Yeah, after we kick your pervert ass,
we'll do that.

18:16.756 --> 18:18.174
My who?

18:18.257 --> 18:19.258
Jesus!

18:22.219 --> 18:24.138
I drove a car.

18:25.931 --> 18:27.141
Yeah?

18:28.392 --> 18:29.852
How far d'you get?

18:29.935 --> 18:31.645
About ten blocks,

18:31.729 --> 18:34.940
then a cop pulled me over
for going too slow.

18:36.776 --> 18:38.360
And being 12.

18:38.444 --> 18:40.196
Where were you trying to go?

18:41.906 --> 18:45.076
- I don't know anymore.
- Yeah.

18:48.079 --> 18:50.539
Do you think Mom's gonna be mad at us?

18:53.793 --> 18:55.211
I think...

18:56.337 --> 18:59.298
we're all gonna be mad at each other
for a while.

19:00.883 --> 19:02.093
Yeah.

19:12.061 --> 19:14.980
Damn! You look like hell.

19:16.273 --> 19:19.443
- Where's my drugs?
- There was a little problem.

19:19.527 --> 19:22.196
Some crazy bitch drowned all the shit
in her swimming pool.

19:22.279 --> 19:24.323
- Wait! Whose swimming pool?
- Mine.

19:24.407 --> 19:25.449
You got a swimming pool?

19:25.533 --> 19:28.494
With a waterfall and a raft
for her kids and everything. It's sweet.

19:28.577 --> 19:31.580
- What the fuck happened?
- It's... It's a long story.

19:31.664 --> 19:33.958
So, no drugs, huh? So...

19:34.041 --> 19:37.336
So, you got my money instead,
that's what you're saying?

19:37.420 --> 19:39.755
Here you go. Game over!

19:40.297 --> 19:43.551
- Let's all go home.
- I wasn't talking to you, was I?

19:43.634 --> 19:45.344
Was I talking to her? No!

19:45.428 --> 19:47.346
I was talking to Janet Evans, here.

19:47.430 --> 19:49.849
- Where's my money?
- Heylia's paying you back

19:49.932 --> 19:52.435
for the money you laid out
to the Armenians, so...

19:52.518 --> 19:54.270
So, she's paying your debt?

19:54.353 --> 19:56.981
I'm here to pay Conrad's debt.

19:57.064 --> 19:58.899
She can go fuck herself.

20:00.526 --> 20:02.236
See, that's not gonna work for me.

20:02.319 --> 20:07.366
I take cash for the white lady,
but I don't want no money for Conrad.

20:07.450 --> 20:09.535
No.

20:09.618 --> 20:13.038
He is the goose that lays
the golden MILF weed.

20:13.122 --> 20:18.669
He's my farmer now. I'm gonna buy him
some overalls and a straw hat. Yee-haw.

20:18.753 --> 20:22.298
Fuck this!
Just take your money, and let's end this.

20:22.381 --> 20:25.384
Now, that's no way to talk
to your new boss, sharecropper.

20:25.468 --> 20:28.721
You'd better watch your tongue.
Now, I bought your chit,

20:28.804 --> 20:31.056
you're about to grow me some shit.

20:31.140 --> 20:33.225
Are we clear? Cos if we're not,

20:33.309 --> 20:36.228
then I can blow
a nice, big space out your head

20:36.312 --> 20:38.355
through your ear
and maybe you'll hear me better.

20:38.439 --> 20:40.483
Come on, Conrad. Let's go.

20:44.028 --> 20:46.238
Looking forward to my crop.

20:47.698 --> 20:50.076
I'll be in touch.

20:50.159 --> 20:52.411
Now, whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:52.495 --> 20:54.663
Where you think you're going?

20:54.747 --> 20:58.292
The way I see it,
you still owe me 150 G's, lady.

20:58.375 --> 21:00.753
I don't take cheques.

21:02.004 --> 21:03.172
What?

21:05.091 --> 21:09.136
No! We're all together, we...
we grow together.

21:10.554 --> 21:11.889
Let's go, Conrad.

21:11.972 --> 21:14.266
You gotta get some rest
so you can wake up tomorrow,

21:14.350 --> 21:17.353
plant some weed
and work on your slave name.

21:18.896 --> 21:20.189
Conrad.

21:21.649 --> 21:24.985
Yeah, looks like
you don't grow with them no more.

21:29.198 --> 21:32.034
What the fuck?
You had that the whole time?

21:32.118 --> 21:33.619
Ain't got no bullets.

21:37.790 --> 21:40.709
What am I supposed to do
with an empty gun?

21:58.727 --> 21:59.895
You OK?

22:00.062 --> 22:01.230
Yeah.

22:02.106 --> 22:03.566
She's fine.

22:04.859 --> 22:06.986
Cos she's still breathing.

22:07.653 --> 22:10.865
She gonna give me my money, too.

22:10.948 --> 22:13.701
Otherwise,
I'm gonna come to her nice house

22:13.784 --> 22:17.580
with her pool... and her kids...

22:17.663 --> 22:21.917
and I gonna float them all
where my weed was drowned at.

22:22.001 --> 22:24.211
You remember
where she lives, right, Marvin?

22:24.295 --> 22:26.338
I'm not so good with directions.

22:26.422 --> 22:28.048
Fucking useless!

22:28.132 --> 22:30.009
I'll deal with you later.

22:30.092 --> 22:33.095
I'm gonna take this off
your shoulder for you.

22:40.102 --> 22:41.687
That's a nice picture.

22:50.529 --> 22:53.783
I'm gonna leave $20 in case
you run into any kind of problems

22:53.866 --> 22:58.579
on your way home or you need to stop
and get some frozen yogurt and shit.

23:00.623 --> 23:01.832
There you go.

23:02.583 --> 23:04.794
Now you just owe me

23:04.919 --> 23:10.216
$149,927.

23:16.722 --> 23:21.185
Well, we did it,
but if you want my professional opinion,

23:21.894 --> 23:25.106
that boy gayer
than a handbag full of rainbows.

23:25.189 --> 23:27.316
I'll see you later, U-Turn.

23:37.785 --> 23:39.995
I got rid of Dana.

23:40.079 --> 23:42.206
I'm free now.

23:43.124 --> 23:47.670
Please forgive me for being so stupid.
I was a fool. A fool.

23:47.753 --> 23:51.882
I should have left her that night,
and you were so brave.

23:51.966 --> 23:53.592
And you're the one for me.

23:53.676 --> 23:55.803
We could be together now.

23:57.096 --> 23:59.432
I love you, Celia, I love so much.

24:01.559 --> 24:03.519
Please, Celia.

24:09.233 --> 24:12.486
Celia... can I come in?

24:25.833 --> 24:29.420
- I'm here to pick up Silas Botwin.
- And Shane as well?

24:30.379 --> 24:32.631
What do you mean?

24:34.675 --> 24:37.303
Both my children are in jail. Perfect!

24:39.180 --> 24:41.640
Shane Botwin! I'm here for...

24:44.894 --> 24:48.647
Nancy, hi. You're here. Thank God.

24:48.731 --> 24:52.401
Did... you two have a fight or something?

24:52.485 --> 24:54.737
Yes, he hit me. Arrest him.

24:55.237 --> 24:57.281
She's kidding. Tell him you're kidding.

24:57.364 --> 24:58.908
I'm kidding. I walked into a door.

24:58.991 --> 25:00.367
Really?

25:01.827 --> 25:04.413
- And you, sir?
- Oh, a door.

25:04.830 --> 25:06.332
Same door.

25:09.085 --> 25:10.503
Ah!

25:13.547 --> 25:14.965
Oh!

25:20.638 --> 25:22.264
What have I done?

25:23.140 --> 25:25.935
I love my wife! I love Dana!

25:26.602 --> 25:28.854
I miss her so much!

25:28.938 --> 25:30.981
She's the most wonderful woman.

25:31.982 --> 25:34.110
I've wrecked my life!

25:46.997 --> 25:49.500
What happened?
Is everything OK?

25:54.171 --> 25:57.216
She didn't say a thing the whole ride home.

25:59.552 --> 26:02.847
Mom... say something.

26:22.366 --> 26:24.243
OK, guys,

26:24.326 --> 26:26.912
let's give Mommy some space, all right?

26:28.330 --> 26:31.000
<i># God reached his hand down from the sky</i>

26:31.083 --> 26:33.919
<i># He flooded the land then he set it on fire</i>

26:39.008 --> 26:41.927
<i># He said,
"Fear me again, know I'm your father</i>

26:42.011 --> 26:45.181
<i># "Remember that no one
can breathe underwater"</i>

26:55.441 --> 26:58.277
<i># So bend your knees and bow your heads</i>

26:58.360 --> 27:01.405
<i># Save your babies, here's your future</i>

27:05.576 --> 27:07.661
<i># Yeah, here's your future</i>

27:11.916 --> 27:14.627
<i># God reached his hand down from the sky</i>

27:14.710 --> 27:17.046
<i># God asked Noah if he wanted to die</i>

27:17.129 --> 27:20.466
<i># He said, "No, sir. Oh, no, sir"</i>

27:21.425 --> 27:22.843
