Previously on <i>Future Man:</i>

00:05.227 --> 00:08.354
If someone is important to
Joshy, it's important to me.

00:08.355 --> 00:10.064
‐He is family. ‐Yeah, well,

00:10.065 --> 00:11.190
I never had a family.

00:11.191 --> 00:12.274
I've always been a soldier.

00:12.275 --> 00:13.359
Life made you a soldier.

00:13.360 --> 00:14.610
You were born to be a chef.

00:14.611 --> 00:16.862
You keep fighting
to make a better future,

00:16.863 --> 00:18.656
but I found the best future,

00:18.657 --> 00:21.992
and it's in the past,
right now, 1985.

00:21.993 --> 00:24.203
I love the '80s!

00:24.204 --> 00:26.038
You have to get on that boat.

00:26.039 --> 00:27.790
If you don't, my colleagues

00:27.791 --> 00:29.041
will shoot you as a baby.

00:29.042 --> 00:30.543
That's resistance law.

00:30.544 --> 00:33.045
Punishment for desertion
is death.

00:33.046 --> 00:35.382
Any chance that's good?

00:38.510 --> 00:40.010
That's the Kronitorium,

00:40.011 --> 00:41.387
where the super cure
was engineered,

00:41.388 --> 00:42.721
where the Biotics were born.

00:42.722 --> 00:44.682
This building isn't
supposed to exist

00:44.683 --> 00:46.392
for another 50 years.

00:46.393 --> 00:47.726
Fifty years?

00:47.727 --> 00:49.478
Well, Kronish should
be long gone by then.

00:49.479 --> 00:51.689
Kronish was only
supposed to cure herpes.

00:51.690 --> 00:53.566
That research was the basis
of the super cure,

00:53.567 --> 00:56.277
which didn't happen
for years after he died.

00:56.278 --> 00:58.571
So, whatever you said
to him drove him

00:58.572 --> 01:00.114
to work on
the super cure himself.

01:00.115 --> 01:02.074
What the fuck did you
say to Kronish?

01:02.075 --> 01:03.868
Nothing, nothing,
I didn't say anything.

01:03.869 --> 01:05.578
I mean, you know,
I had to get him on the boat,

01:05.579 --> 01:07.455
so I told him
to follow his heart,

01:07.456 --> 01:10.332
to choose love.

01:10.333 --> 01:13.169
And maybe I peppered in,
like, a little bit

01:13.170 --> 01:14.587
of detail about his future.

01:14.588 --> 01:15.880
What?

01:15.881 --> 01:17.631
You never tell anyone
about their future.

01:17.632 --> 01:19.091
That is time travel 101.

01:19.092 --> 01:21.093
I even know that and I
didn't go to your stupid

01:21.094 --> 01:22.595
made‐up time travel college.

01:22.596 --> 01:24.096
Okay, well, maybe
there's still time

01:24.097 --> 01:25.431
before the cure's released.

01:25.432 --> 01:26.849
Maybe we can go back
in time and fix this.

01:26.850 --> 01:28.476
Maybe there's, like,
a really cool solution

01:28.477 --> 01:30.186
that we don't know of yet
in the future.

01:30.187 --> 01:32.521
No, no, no, there's no "we."

01:32.522 --> 01:34.899
Coming back for you
thinking you were our savior,

01:34.900 --> 01:37.776
that was the biggest
mistake I've made in my life.

01:37.777 --> 01:39.528
There's only one way
to fix this,

01:39.529 --> 01:41.323
and I'm doing it by myself.

01:42.908 --> 01:45.201
Tiger, I'm sorry.

01:45.202 --> 01:46.368
Tiger, where are you going?

01:46.369 --> 01:49.039
Far away from you, fuck nose.

02:06.139 --> 02:07.306
Who's there?

02:07.307 --> 02:09.809
What are you doing in my bushes?

02:12.687 --> 02:14.438
What I need to do.

02:14.439 --> 02:16.358
I've traveled a long
way to be here.

02:18.318 --> 02:20.736
Well, you sure picked
a rotten day to do it.

02:20.737 --> 02:22.989
You're wetter than
a Kentucky catfish.

02:24.282 --> 02:25.699
Well, get on in here.

02:25.700 --> 02:27.243
I'll get you some dry clothes.

02:27.244 --> 02:30.412
Something warm to eat.

02:30.413 --> 02:32.540
Alrighty.

02:32.541 --> 02:35.877
What were you doing standing
out there in the rain like that?

02:41.696 --> 02:45.177
That's all right. You don't have
to answer if you don't want to.

02:45.178 --> 02:46.512
Let me put the kettle on.

02:46.513 --> 02:48.180
Is there anyone else
in the house right now?

02:48.181 --> 02:49.348
'Fraid not.

02:49.349 --> 02:50.891
It's just me and Elias here.

02:50.892 --> 02:52.893
He's the man of the house
since his daddy, Clarence,

02:52.894 --> 02:54.395
passed a few months back.

02:54.396 --> 02:57.357
Never even got a chance
to meet his only son.

02:58.390 --> 03:00.526
Hi.

03:00.527 --> 03:02.987
‐There you go.
‐He was a soldier?

03:02.988 --> 03:05.239
Fought bravely for his country.

03:05.240 --> 03:08.867
Saved 16 of his men
on Omaha Beach.

03:08.868 --> 03:10.869
That's how he lost
his first leg.

03:10.870 --> 03:12.204
How'd he lose the second one?

03:12.205 --> 03:13.956
Frostbite.

03:13.957 --> 03:16.542
Used his one good sock
as a tourniquet

03:16.543 --> 03:19.253
to stop one of his men
from bleeding out.

03:19.254 --> 03:21.880
So, okay, this‐‐
this baby's dead father

03:21.881 --> 03:23.090
had no legs?

03:23.091 --> 03:25.676
It was hard on him coming back.

03:25.677 --> 03:27.553
Went to war a hopeful boy,

03:27.554 --> 03:30.055
and came back a legless man.

03:30.056 --> 03:33.100
Not many opportunities for
legless black men these days.

03:33.101 --> 03:34.143
Okay.

03:34.144 --> 03:35.519
The last battle that he fought

03:35.520 --> 03:37.896
was against tuberculosis.

03:37.897 --> 03:41.108
Never gave up, right to his last

03:41.109 --> 03:43.569
excruciating breath.

03:43.570 --> 03:45.279
Seems like you know
a thing about hard times

03:45.280 --> 03:46.572
or two yourself.

03:46.573 --> 03:48.449
Yeah, I've eaten some rat, so...

03:48.450 --> 03:50.617
you know, it hasn't
been all bad.

03:50.618 --> 03:53.078
Just trying to keep
food on the table,

03:53.079 --> 03:54.747
round up whatever scraps I can

03:54.748 --> 03:57.291
to keep us warm and alive.

03:57.292 --> 03:59.877
I thank the Lord
for this little miracle.

03:59.878 --> 04:01.170
Stop it.

04:01.171 --> 04:02.921
I don't even think
I'd have the strength

04:02.922 --> 04:04.256
to go on without him.

04:04.257 --> 04:06.383
This little sweet child
is the only family

04:06.384 --> 04:08.303
I have left in this world.

04:09.512 --> 04:11.805
Look at me rambling on.

04:11.806 --> 04:12.806
That's your tea.

04:12.807 --> 04:15.392
Do you mind holding him?

04:15.393 --> 04:19.105
Here we go.

04:22.609 --> 04:24.318
Now, careful with
the top of his head,

04:24.319 --> 04:26.278
he's still got that soft spot.

04:26.279 --> 04:28.405
You know, doctor says
that one wrong push

04:28.406 --> 04:30.366
could kill him instantly.

04:30.367 --> 04:32.077
Imagine that!

04:37.874 --> 04:39.584
I'm gonna kill you.

04:47.967 --> 04:49.552
Tomorrow.

04:56.309 --> 04:58.227
You sure you don't want
a night off, Tiane?

04:58.228 --> 04:59.520
You hush now.

04:59.521 --> 05:00.896
You know, there's
no place I'd rather be

05:00.897 --> 05:03.524
than caring for your youngin'.

05:03.525 --> 05:05.275
I think the cornbread's burning.

05:05.276 --> 05:07.737
Heaven bless that nose of yours.

05:10.990 --> 05:12.574
You sleep tight.

05:12.575 --> 05:13.993
I'll kill you tomorrow.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.960
Tiane, why don't you
say grace tonight?

05:22.961 --> 05:25.796
I'd love to!

05:25.797 --> 05:28.507
Thank you, Lord of this time,

05:28.508 --> 05:30.968
for giving us
this shelter and warmth,

05:30.969 --> 05:34.638
and the sweet bounty
of chitlins and hushpuppies.

05:34.639 --> 05:36.348
‐Amen. ‐Amen.

05:36.349 --> 05:38.350
‐What can I get for you?
‐Two hushpuppies, please.

05:38.351 --> 05:39.601
Alright.

05:39.602 --> 05:41.186
Estelle, will you tell
that beau of yours

05:41.187 --> 05:43.856
to quit fooling around
and take the dang picture.

05:43.857 --> 05:45.524
Best do what she says, Jerome.

05:45.525 --> 05:47.693
Milkman got fresh with
her the other day,

05:47.694 --> 05:49.820
and she punched him
square in the biscuits.

05:49.821 --> 05:51.530
‐‐guilty. ‐Look up!

05:51.531 --> 05:52.573
Here we go.

05:52.574 --> 05:55.118
Happy Birthday!

05:59.289 --> 06:00.539
Greetings.

06:00.540 --> 06:02.374
Ooh.

06:02.375 --> 06:03.542
‐Thanks. ‐‐

06:03.543 --> 06:05.169
I just put
the little ankle biter

06:05.170 --> 06:06.920
down for a nap.

06:06.921 --> 06:10.883
He had such a tickle
playing with that new

06:10.884 --> 06:12.134
slinky thing‐a‐mabob.

06:12.135 --> 06:14.845
You should've seen him,
he was in fat city.

06:14.846 --> 06:17.181
Tiane, I have news.

06:17.182 --> 06:18.223
Maybe you should sit down.

06:18.224 --> 06:20.058
Gladly, dogs are barking.

06:20.059 --> 06:21.519
Been on these stompers all day.

06:24.731 --> 06:26.648
Well, don't run out of gas now,

06:26.649 --> 06:28.275
you haven't even
put her into drive.

06:28.276 --> 06:30.319
Tiane, he finally did it.

06:30.320 --> 06:32.030
He proposed.

06:33.239 --> 06:34.531
Look at that.

06:34.532 --> 06:36.200
Well...

06:36.201 --> 06:38.243
it's about damn time
if you want my two cents.

06:38.244 --> 06:39.244
Tiane!

06:39.245 --> 06:40.579
I know I shouldn't cuss,

06:40.580 --> 06:42.122
but that man has been
holding a torch for you

06:42.123 --> 06:44.708
for way too long
not to be acting on it.

06:44.709 --> 06:46.627
He's asked us
to move in with him.

06:46.628 --> 06:48.837
‐we've been
outgrowing this house.

06:48.838 --> 06:50.130
What, with Elias sprouting up

06:50.131 --> 06:52.090
like a cornstalk in late July.

06:52.091 --> 06:53.550
No, Tiane.

06:53.551 --> 06:56.136
He asked me and Elias
to move in with him.

06:56.137 --> 06:58.514
‐ ‐We're starting a new life,

06:58.515 --> 06:59.932
a new family.

06:59.933 --> 07:03.018
Maybe it's about time
you did the same thing.

07:03.019 --> 07:04.770
Now, what about Wolf?

07:04.771 --> 07:07.023
I am sure he's out
there thinking of you.

07:10.068 --> 07:12.486
No, no, Wolf's made his choice.

07:12.487 --> 07:14.530
He's living the life
he wants to live,

07:14.531 --> 07:16.114
and that doesn't include me.

07:16.115 --> 07:17.449
Honey.

07:17.450 --> 07:20.118
You made a family here,
and I'm sure you can

07:20.119 --> 07:21.912
do it out there, too.

07:21.913 --> 07:23.914
You need to find your people.

07:23.915 --> 07:28.044
You'll always have
a place at our Sunday table.

07:46.646 --> 07:48.188
You've been very kind.

07:48.189 --> 07:50.232
You know, I never intended
to be a part of your family.

07:50.233 --> 07:53.944
In fact, I came here
for something else entirely.

07:53.945 --> 07:55.989
I should say goodbye to Elias.

08:22.265 --> 08:24.474
Did you leave a knife
in Elias' crib?

08:24.475 --> 08:25.892
It's a gift.

08:25.893 --> 08:27.769
Give it to him
in his fifth year,

08:27.770 --> 08:29.272
when he comes of age.

09:33.419 --> 09:35.588
I'm so sorry, Wolf.

09:59.946 --> 10:03.616
My name is Wolf, I was born
in the worst of times.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.005
Hey, knifers keepers.

10:18.006 --> 10:19.589
No rules in the rat pit.

10:19.590 --> 10:21.092
Hey, that's hers!

10:23.261 --> 10:24.220
Get him!

10:24.221 --> 10:25.763
Yeah, get him, Tiger!

10:46.701 --> 10:48.661
Hey, Wolf.

10:50.329 --> 10:53.081
Heads or tails?

10:53.082 --> 10:54.500
Tails.

10:58.337 --> 11:03.091
In 1985 I was reborn
as Corey Wolf‐Hart.

11:03.092 --> 11:05.010
It was the best of times.

11:05.011 --> 11:07.054
And I had a particular
set of skills

11:07.055 --> 11:08.806
that allowed me to dominate.

11:10.016 --> 11:11.016
Really?

11:13.603 --> 11:15.353
God! What's happening?

11:15.354 --> 11:16.354
No, no, no, no!

11:16.355 --> 11:18.190
No, no, Richard!

11:18.191 --> 11:20.568
Richard, no!

11:27.700 --> 11:28.950
We have money!

11:28.951 --> 11:30.035
I'm sorry, Linda.

11:30.036 --> 11:31.787
Sorry I couldn't protect us.

11:31.788 --> 11:37.794
Prepare to dine!

11:39.378 --> 11:41.797
In a past life I lived each day

11:41.798 --> 11:44.216
knowing I could've
died at any moment.

11:44.217 --> 11:47.427
So that's the gift
I gave my customers:

11:47.428 --> 11:49.429
An immersive dining experience

11:49.430 --> 11:51.681
that made them feel
like they were gonna die.

11:51.682 --> 11:54.309
Welcome to Wolf‐Hart's.

11:54.310 --> 11:58.313
Because only then
could they truly live.

11:58.314 --> 12:00.148
So, wait?

12:00.149 --> 12:01.483
We're not gonna die?

12:01.484 --> 12:02.692
Not today.

12:02.693 --> 12:03.985
My God!

12:03.986 --> 12:06.238
It was as if they
were tasting food

12:06.239 --> 12:08.198
for the first time.

12:08.199 --> 12:09.491
My God.

12:09.492 --> 12:11.535
Combine the natural adrenaline
your body creates

12:11.536 --> 12:13.245
the moment before death

12:13.246 --> 12:15.413
with the best food in the world.

12:15.414 --> 12:16.748
You know where you're going?

12:16.749 --> 12:17.999
Heaven.

12:18.000 --> 12:20.210
But you don't have
to die to get there.

12:20.211 --> 12:21.628
I love you so much.

12:21.629 --> 12:23.046
I love you.

12:23.047 --> 12:25.632
I don't say it enough.

12:25.633 --> 12:27.509
Life made me a soldier,

12:27.510 --> 12:30.346
but I was born to be a chef.

12:37.436 --> 12:40.063
But I wasn't some
kind of second‐rate hack

12:40.064 --> 12:42.649
flourishing on a gimmick.

12:42.650 --> 12:44.776
I was a God damn artist,

12:44.777 --> 12:47.237
a culinary futurist
creating food

12:47.238 --> 12:49.365
eons ahead of its time.

12:54.245 --> 12:55.787
A taste of the tundra.

12:55.788 --> 12:56.955
Elk carpaccio,

12:56.956 --> 12:58.540
elderberry reduction,

12:58.541 --> 13:00.041
raw snails,

13:00.042 --> 13:01.459
and a lichen gastrique.

13:01.460 --> 13:04.963
Pairs nicely with
our cocktail of the evening:

13:04.964 --> 13:07.090
The Blazing Nog.

13:07.091 --> 13:09.050
Blaze was the perfect wingman.

13:09.051 --> 13:11.052
The Goose to my Maverick,

13:11.053 --> 13:13.221
the Rain Man to my Charlie,

13:13.222 --> 13:15.182
the Coughlin to my Flanagan.

13:15.183 --> 13:17.267
Though, that last
one's a deep cut.

13:17.268 --> 13:18.643
Cocktail!

13:18.644 --> 13:22.480
And, boy, did he know
how to mix 'em.

13:22.481 --> 13:24.150
No, Richard, no!

13:26.736 --> 13:28.653
He also kidnapped
anyone I told him to,

13:28.654 --> 13:30.614
and didn't ask any questions.

13:30.615 --> 13:31.991
Not one.

13:53.930 --> 13:56.514
Nothing about
Wolf‐Hart's was legal.

13:56.515 --> 13:59.267
I was a cash‐only business
in a condemned building

13:59.268 --> 14:01.020
in the most dangerous
part of town.

14:06.692 --> 14:08.818
And still, they flock to me.

14:08.819 --> 14:11.071
The rich, the famous.

14:11.072 --> 14:14.033
Like moths to a flame.

14:18.037 --> 14:20.205
More stars came in Wolf‐Hart's

14:20.206 --> 14:22.792
than in Rob Lowe's
Malibu fuck pad.

14:25.962 --> 14:27.796
Ms. Roberts?

14:27.797 --> 14:29.464
I don't normally do this,

14:29.465 --> 14:32.050
but I just
rewatched <i>Steel Magnolias,</i>

14:32.051 --> 14:38.056
and that scene where you
seizure with the juice...

14:38.057 --> 14:39.976
it gets me every time.

14:41.227 --> 14:42.478
It's so funny.

14:47.149 --> 14:49.025
I wasn't in it for the money.

14:49.026 --> 14:51.346
But that's just what people say
when they're rolling in it.

14:53.990 --> 14:57.450
Yep, everything was
hunky fucking dory.

14:57.451 --> 14:59.828
Then in 1989, Wolf‐Hart's won

14:59.829 --> 15:02.915
the coveted Bocce Sausa
for World's Best Restaurant.

15:10.089 --> 15:12.132
I'd achieved everything
I set out to since

15:12.133 --> 15:14.467
that fateful night in 1985.

15:14.468 --> 15:18.013
But still, something
was missing.

15:18.014 --> 15:20.056
I couldn't quite
put my finger on it.

15:20.057 --> 15:23.101
All right, I got something
important I gotta say.

15:23.102 --> 15:25.729
When I first met Corey,
I didn't know what

15:25.730 --> 15:27.731
kind of volleyball player
he was gonna be.

15:27.732 --> 15:30.734
But, Corey, after four
life‐changing years together,

15:30.735 --> 15:33.278
I know exactly what
kind of player you are.

15:33.279 --> 15:35.989
You're the kind of player
that will convince a friend

15:35.990 --> 15:38.700
to stop being a prostitute.

15:38.701 --> 15:40.785
You're the kind of player
that will teach

15:40.786 --> 15:44.456
that same friend how to read.

15:44.457 --> 15:47.250
But above all,
you're the kind of player

15:47.251 --> 15:50.837
that will never leave
a teammate behind.

15:50.838 --> 15:52.672
Ever!

15:52.673 --> 15:53.757
To Corey!

15:53.758 --> 15:54.884
Yeah!

15:57.428 --> 15:58.763
Woo‐hoo!

16:00.056 --> 16:01.264
Hey, bro.

16:01.265 --> 16:03.224
Not to overdo
the volleyball thing,

16:03.225 --> 16:05.853
but you gave me a bump
when I needed one.

16:08.355 --> 16:12.317
You look like you
could use one right now.

16:12.318 --> 16:14.569
Woops, that's a little
more than a bump.

16:14.570 --> 16:16.322
I think we'll go ahead
and split it‐‐.

16:18.449 --> 16:19.658
Whoa!

16:21.118 --> 16:22.243
Yeah!

16:22.244 --> 16:23.912
There we go!

16:23.913 --> 16:25.789
Hey, Blaze, man.

16:25.790 --> 16:27.999
Read that magazine
article out loud.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.210
Yeah.

16:34.590 --> 16:38.802
A dash of dan‐‐dan‐‐.

16:38.803 --> 16:39.844
Danger.

16:39.845 --> 16:41.679
‐Danger! ‐Yes.

16:41.680 --> 16:46.184
A pinch of pan...

16:46.185 --> 16:47.393
panic.

16:47.394 --> 16:50.063
"And a mouthful of menace."

16:50.064 --> 16:53.775
L.A.'s bad boy
Chef Corey Wolf‐Hart

16:53.776 --> 16:56.486
"conquers the world."

16:56.487 --> 17:00.156
You've been a bad boy.

17:00.157 --> 17:04.327
You've been a very bad boy.

17:04.328 --> 17:05.869
Where are you going?

17:05.871 --> 17:08.623
My water just broke!

17:08.624 --> 17:10.667
So did this case.

17:19.551 --> 17:22.220
There was no downside
to cocaine.

17:22.221 --> 17:23.471
Period.

17:23.472 --> 17:25.348
If you have a chance to try it,

17:25.348 --> 17:27.476
I strongly recommend it.

17:31.313 --> 17:33.606
I assure you,
that pelican was murdered

17:33.607 --> 17:35.692
in accordance with Maritime Law.

17:35.693 --> 17:38.987
I'm not here because
of a dead bird.

17:38.988 --> 17:41.448
I'm here because
of a dead partner.

17:41.449 --> 17:44.909
No, what happened to Blaze?

17:44.910 --> 17:46.161
What?

17:46.162 --> 17:47.454
No!

17:47.455 --> 17:48.747
My partner!

17:50.916 --> 17:52.125
Thank God.

17:52.126 --> 17:54.627
Hey, you don't walk
away from this.

17:54.628 --> 17:58.465
You know how much shit
I've caught chasing ghosts.

17:58.466 --> 18:01.259
Whole precinct calls me crazy.

18:01.260 --> 18:03.803
Leave magazine ads
all around my office

18:03.804 --> 18:05.972
for Obsession perfume.

18:05.973 --> 18:07.474
Calvin Klein?

18:07.475 --> 18:09.017
He was in here the other night.

18:09.018 --> 18:10.310
He's a good friend of mine.

18:10.311 --> 18:11.769
‐Yeah? ‐Yeah.

18:11.770 --> 18:13.980
How's your other friend?

18:13.981 --> 18:15.900
The one with the purple hair?

18:21.447 --> 18:23.698
You know, it's funny...

18:23.699 --> 18:25.283
I spent all these years

18:25.284 --> 18:28.077
thinking I was chasing radicals.

18:28.078 --> 18:32.749
Turns out I was just
hunting some sellouts

18:32.750 --> 18:35.293
serving overpriced pelican soup

18:35.294 --> 18:39.589
to undeserving yuppie scum.

18:39.590 --> 18:42.842
It's bouillabaisse.

18:42.843 --> 18:44.969
You're no idealist.

18:44.970 --> 18:48.139
The only thing you
care about is yourself.

18:48.140 --> 18:49.724
And from the looks of it,

18:49.725 --> 18:52.018
you don't even do
a good job of that,

18:52.019 --> 18:54.062
you strung out piece of shit.

18:54.063 --> 18:56.814
You got nothing on me, Manilow!

18:56.815 --> 18:59.817
Now get the fuck out of here.

18:59.818 --> 19:01.736
I'll be seeing you, Corey.

19:01.737 --> 19:03.571
No, you won't.

19:03.572 --> 19:04.864
You're blacklisted.

19:04.865 --> 19:07.992
You and Danny Aiello.

19:07.993 --> 19:11.079
Have fun dumpster
diving at Spago,

19:11.080 --> 19:13.457
you fucking dipshit.

19:16.919 --> 19:18.753
My encounter with
that handsome cop

19:18.754 --> 19:20.547
didn't affect me one bit.

19:20.548 --> 19:25.176
If anything, it inspired me
to kick things up a notch.

19:25.177 --> 19:27.554
I had to make sure
I was truly challenging

19:27.555 --> 19:30.056
my clientele's core beliefs.

19:30.057 --> 19:31.432
It wasn't enough
to make them feel

19:31.433 --> 19:33.810
like they were gonna
die in their time.

19:33.811 --> 19:35.853
I had to make them
understand what it was like

19:35.854 --> 19:37.856
to live in mine.

19:43.362 --> 19:45.197
Fromage a trois.

19:46.365 --> 19:47.407
What is this one?

19:47.408 --> 19:48.491
Roquefort, camembert?

19:48.492 --> 19:49.867
Buffalo dick cheese.

19:49.868 --> 19:51.202
Eat left to right.

19:51.203 --> 19:53.538
I experimented
with bold, new ingredients

19:53.539 --> 19:56.666
to give my customers
a scavenger's palate.

19:56.667 --> 19:58.084
Maggot risotto.

19:58.085 --> 20:01.963
Bat wing fritto misto
with a side of guanomole.

20:01.964 --> 20:04.716
And my pièce de résistance...

20:04.717 --> 20:07.218
unseasoned rat miscarriage.

20:07.219 --> 20:08.470
Bon appetite.

20:12.975 --> 20:16.144
By late '92, I'd nixed myself,

20:16.145 --> 20:17.687
Stevie Nicks,

20:17.688 --> 20:19.606
as in did so much coke
I couldn't taste

20:19.607 --> 20:21.024
or smell anything anymore.

20:21.025 --> 20:22.735
I can't smell it!

20:34.872 --> 20:37.416
Not even the moruga!

20:39.001 --> 20:41.134
But in spite of all that,
like Fleetwood Mac,

20:41.135 --> 20:44.088
Wolf‐Hart's was
still an institution.

20:44.089 --> 20:46.758
I didn't have a roadie
to blow coke up my ass,

20:46.759 --> 20:48.134
but I did have a Blaze.

20:48.135 --> 20:49.510
Fire in the hole!

20:49.511 --> 20:51.430
He had quite the lung capacity.

20:54.350 --> 20:56.644
I got it.

21:00.147 --> 21:03.066
Every one of you
has been lucky enough

21:03.067 --> 21:06.069
to feast on my creations.

21:06.070 --> 21:08.071
Now, behold!

21:08.072 --> 21:11.450
My greatest creation yet!

21:15.579 --> 21:20.333
Where I'm from, you had
to fight for every bite.

21:20.334 --> 21:22.293
And that's exactly
the kind of hell

21:22.294 --> 21:24.921
I'm about to put you through.

21:24.922 --> 21:26.756
Two men enter,

21:26.757 --> 21:28.549
one man leaves

21:28.550 --> 21:33.055
with a white truffle
from Alba, Italy.

21:43.148 --> 21:47.361
I give you the Truffledome!

21:57.287 --> 21:58.996
You, what's your name?

21:58.997 --> 22:01.708
‐Greg. ‐Greg!

22:01.709 --> 22:04.293
You get the lance.

22:04.294 --> 22:06.003
You, what's your name?

22:06.004 --> 22:07.296
Lance.

22:07.297 --> 22:09.717
Lance, you get the ax.

22:11.760 --> 22:14.179
Wait, switch weapons.

22:15.764 --> 22:17.223
All right, warriors.

22:17.224 --> 22:21.270
On my signal, unleash hell!

22:26.024 --> 22:27.276
Now!

22:28.861 --> 22:32.029
‐Who is gonna draw first blood?
‐This thing's heavy.

22:32.030 --> 22:33.364
You know, this looks
pretty sharp.

22:33.365 --> 22:35.742
One of you needs
to draw first blood.

22:35.743 --> 22:36.702
Let's go!

22:36.703 --> 22:39.204
Have I taught you nothing?

22:42.374 --> 22:45.085
Stop giggling
in the Truffledome!

22:47.463 --> 22:49.005
I'm getting tired.

22:49.006 --> 22:50.215
Who's gonna pin who?

22:52.468 --> 22:53.509
Heads or tails?

22:53.510 --> 22:55.011
Heads or tails?

22:55.012 --> 22:57.388
Heads or tails?

22:57.389 --> 22:59.849
Heads or tails?

22:59.850 --> 23:01.726
Heads or tails?

23:01.727 --> 23:03.728
Heads or tails?

23:03.729 --> 23:05.772
Then it all hit me.

23:05.773 --> 23:08.566
No matter how much
I simulated it for them,

23:08.567 --> 23:09.901
these people never had to fight

23:09.902 --> 23:12.111
for anything in their lives.

23:12.112 --> 23:13.237
They would never understand

23:13.238 --> 23:14.989
what I'd been through.

23:14.990 --> 23:17.658
And the only person
who ever did,

23:17.659 --> 23:19.244
I abandoned.

23:28.796 --> 23:30.923
The lance for Lance!

23:33.383 --> 23:34.968
I'm Greg!

23:38.514 --> 23:39.931
I'm just a banker!

23:39.932 --> 23:41.974
Those are your last
fucking words?

23:41.975 --> 23:45.686
Get the fuck out of here.

23:45.687 --> 23:47.271
This is pain.

23:47.272 --> 23:49.106
This is real life!

23:49.107 --> 23:51.359
Somebody fight me!

23:51.360 --> 23:52.945
Get out of here!

24:09.628 --> 24:10.795
Corey?

24:10.796 --> 24:12.839
You okay, man?
Should I be worried?

24:12.840 --> 24:14.632
You're gonna need
to disappear for a while.

24:14.633 --> 24:16.009
Got nowhere to go, man.

24:17.261 --> 24:19.262
I got a buddy
who lives in Brentwood

24:19.263 --> 24:20.888
with a guest house.

24:20.889 --> 24:22.139
His name's OJ.

24:22.140 --> 24:23.307
OJ Simpson?

24:23.308 --> 24:24.976
He's a good guy.

24:24.977 --> 24:27.311
Just live in his guest house.

24:27.312 --> 24:30.273
Life will be simpler
for you now, Blaze.

24:30.274 --> 24:31.733
Just go!

24:33.443 --> 24:35.653
Where are you gonna go?

24:35.654 --> 24:37.489
Where I've always belonged.

24:42.494 --> 24:44.954
I was once a part
of something that mattered,

24:44.955 --> 24:47.206
part of a team that mattered.

24:47.207 --> 24:48.792
A family.

24:50.502 --> 24:53.796
I threw it all away for
a mission of self‐discovery.

24:53.797 --> 24:56.674
But all I discovered
was that leaving you

24:56.675 --> 24:59.219
was the worst choice
I've ever made.

25:03.974 --> 25:07.101
I let you down, Tiger.

25:07.102 --> 25:10.021
I let humanity down.

25:10.022 --> 25:11.314
And you're not here to give me

25:11.315 --> 25:14.151
the deserter's death I deserve.

25:15.736 --> 25:18.196
But I got another
trigger man in mind.

25:21.199 --> 25:23.160
All I can say to you is...

25:26.830 --> 25:28.206
I'm sorry.

25:31.835 --> 25:34.004
End suicide note.

25:58.987 --> 26:01.614
Hands up, Wolf‐Hart.

26:01.615 --> 26:03.908
Jesus, what the fuck
are you doing?

26:03.909 --> 26:06.494
Blowing my last butt rail.

26:06.495 --> 26:08.204
What does it look like?

26:08.205 --> 26:11.207
Your little battle royale
has every cop in this city

26:11.208 --> 26:13.751
looking for you,
so why'd you call me?

26:13.752 --> 26:17.129
Justice needed to be served.

26:17.130 --> 26:19.007
And you're the man to do it.

26:20.342 --> 26:22.593
So, come on!

26:22.594 --> 26:25.513
Shoot me in the heart.

26:25.514 --> 26:29.684
Feed my corpse to the hungry.

26:29.685 --> 26:31.435
I got a better plan.

26:31.436 --> 26:34.772
I'm gonna feed you to
the criminal justice system.

26:34.773 --> 26:36.107
Get your confession,

26:36.108 --> 26:39.068
make a little call
to the Santiago family

26:39.069 --> 26:41.362
that's 24 years overdue.

26:41.363 --> 26:44.156
No, I'm sorry, Detective.

26:44.157 --> 26:46.993
That's not the justice
I'm looking for.

26:46.994 --> 26:49.412
But I do have
a confession for you.

26:49.413 --> 26:53.582
Killing your partner was fun.

26:53.583 --> 26:56.962
Shut your fucking mouth,
you butt junkie!

26:58.922 --> 27:01.465
What kind of an idiot

27:01.466 --> 27:06.303
drives right into
a subatomic sensor mine?

27:06.304 --> 27:09.098
I know what you're doing.

27:09.099 --> 27:11.142
You think you're the first punk

27:11.143 --> 27:14.437
who's every tried
to suicide‐by‐cop me?

27:14.438 --> 27:17.314
No.

27:17.315 --> 27:18.816
Maybe I'll be the last.

27:18.817 --> 27:20.317
Now, don't do it, Corey!

27:20.318 --> 27:21.569
Surrender!

27:21.570 --> 27:23.654
Never.

27:23.655 --> 27:25.031
What the fuck?

27:34.332 --> 27:36.917
You look terrible.

27:36.918 --> 27:38.628
So do you.

27:40.714 --> 27:43.048
I got your message.

27:43.049 --> 27:46.010
Yeah.

27:46.011 --> 27:49.848
Truffledome sounds
like my kind of party.

27:52.350 --> 27:53.852
Let's get you home, soldier.

28:07.282 --> 28:09.034
Freeze!

28:12.996 --> 28:14.331
Where'd they go?

28:16.208 --> 28:17.834
Where did they go?

28:19.002 --> 28:23.799
Where did they go?!

28:31.556 --> 28:33.641
Tiger, I'm sorry,

28:33.642 --> 28:35.352
I fucked everything up, I just‐‐.

28:37.771 --> 28:39.480
It was all worth it.

28:39.481 --> 28:41.650
It was all worth it
to get you back.

28:44.528 --> 28:46.363
You're the only family I need.

28:49.324 --> 28:50.741
Are you...

28:50.742 --> 28:51.784
are you okay?

28:51.785 --> 28:53.911
Yeah.

28:53.912 --> 28:58.041
Looks like you
got something back.

28:59.626 --> 29:00.919
I did!

29:03.088 --> 29:05.089
Why does my asshole feel numb?

29:05.090 --> 29:06.591
I have no idea.

29:12.597 --> 29:14.391
No idea.

29:15.305 --> 29:21.192
