Yes, I, um...
I'm Officer Decker,

29:26.199 --> 29:28.157
and I'm here to help Tio.

29:28.201 --> 29:30.899
And what makes you think
that I need your help

29:30.943 --> 29:33.641
representing my client? Hmm?

29:33.684 --> 29:36.992
Uh, well, because we know he
works for the Sarkisian family.

29:37.036 --> 29:38.864
Mm-hmm.And he's also implicated

29:38.907 --> 29:40.909
in the murder
of Aiden Scott.

29:40.953 --> 29:43.172
So if he agrees
to speak with us,

29:43.216 --> 29:44.826
we'll go easier on him.

29:44.870 --> 29:47.568
Have you ever heard of
something called "leverage,"

29:47.611 --> 29:48.656
Officer Decker?

29:50.223 --> 29:52.747
If not, let me help you.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.184
It's like pressure or influence,

29:55.228 --> 29:58.579
and it's something
that you currently can't apply,

29:58.622 --> 30:00.842
because none of what you
said actually resembles

30:00.886 --> 30:02.539
proof of a crime.

30:02.583 --> 30:04.019
Why do you say that?

30:04.063 --> 30:06.630
Because when you're out there
writing traffic tickets,

30:06.674 --> 30:10.025
I'm representing families
like the Lings and the Sokolovs.

30:10.069 --> 30:11.244
Actual killers.

30:12.462 --> 30:14.769
Alleged, anyway.

30:14.813 --> 30:18.860
So it's going to take
a lot more than spunk--

30:18.904 --> 30:23.691
especially rookie spunk--
and a prayer to intimidate me.

30:26.650 --> 30:29.001
You represent
the Sokolov family?

30:29.044 --> 30:30.959
And you also represent

30:31.003 --> 30:32.743
Tio and the Sarkisians.

30:32.787 --> 30:34.963
So, I-I thought
the Sarkisians

30:36.443 --> 30:38.880
over their bookmaking
operations.

30:38.924 --> 30:40.534
I wonder how they'd feel
if they knew

30:40.577 --> 30:43.667
that their lawyer
was double-dipping.

30:43.711 --> 30:46.235
[chuckles]: You know,
I'm-I'm new at this, so...

30:46.279 --> 30:49.064
I don't know what the term is
for what you're doing,

30:49.108 --> 30:51.937
but I think
it's called "leverage."

30:56.158 --> 30:58.117
Please have a seat, Officer.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.554
Aw, thank you.

31:06.603 --> 31:09.084
I didn't expect you
to be so happy
