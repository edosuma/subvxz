Previously on Love Island...

00:21.720 --> 00:23.399
..there were divisions.

00:23.400 --> 00:27.159
<font color="yellow">You can split up and remain in the</font>
<font color="yellow">villa or stay together and leave.</font>

00:27.160 --> 00:31.079
<font color="cyan">We have decided to take the test</font>
<font color="cyan">and we will split up.</font>

00:31.080 --> 00:35.760
And there were new additions.

00:37.080 --> 00:40.599
<font color="yellow">If you liked each other</font>
<font color="yellow">you would have left together.</font>

00:40.600 --> 00:44.960
<font color="yellow">I would go home, what are you doing?</font>
<font color="cyan">It is so hard.</font>

00:50.920 --> 00:52.920
Tonight...

00:55.800 --> 01:01.520
..the islanders
are in crisis.

01:05.080 --> 01:07.719
<c.color008000>I want people to shut up.</font>

01:07.720 --> 01:10.239
<font color="yellow">Are you having second thoughts?</font>

01:10.240 --> 01:12.920
<font color="cyan">I don't know, I am having doubts.</font>

01:14.560 --> 01:17.360
<font color="yellow">(SIGHS)</font>
<font color="yellow">OK. I just...</font>

01:35.520 --> 01:39.239
After Georgia broke up with Sam
so they could return to the villa,

01:39.240 --> 01:42.839
Dani's just had words with her and,
sadly for Georgia,

01:42.840 --> 01:47.000
none of those words were "great",
"idea" or "babe".

01:51.440 --> 01:53.280
<font color="yellow">Shall we have a chat?</font>

02:01.400 --> 02:04.719
<font color="cyan">Are you OK?</font>
<font color="yellow">I want your view.</font>

02:04.720 --> 02:08.719
<font color="yellow">What were the conversations</font>
<font color="yellow">when I was on these dates?</font>

02:08.720 --> 02:11.879
<font color="cyan">What was said about your decision,</font>

02:11.880 --> 02:13.599
<font color="cyan">because Sam is so into you,</font>

02:13.600 --> 02:16.199
<font color="cyan">we thought Sam would want</font>
<font color="cyan">to go and you would want to stay.</font>

02:16.200 --> 02:19.119
<font color="yellow">No!</font>

02:19.120 --> 02:23.479
<font color="yellow">Sam wanted to prove</font>
<font color="yellow">everyone wrong.</font>

02:23.480 --> 02:25.879
<font color="cyan">You would do that by leaving</font>
<font color="cyan">together as a couple.</font>

02:25.880 --> 02:31.840
<font color="cyan">Staying here just means</font>
<font color="cyan">meeting someone else in my eyes.</font>

02:35.840 --> 02:40.999
<c.color008000>Do you feel like you have</font>
<c.color008000>made the wrong decision?</font>

02:41.000 --> 02:45.519
<c.color008000>Even if that was you and Jack,</font>
<c.color008000>would you stay or would you go?</font>

02:45.520 --> 02:49.559
<font color="cyan">I would be interested</font>
<font color="cyan">to see what he thought,</font>

02:49.560 --> 02:53.879
<font color="cyan">but I would be tempted</font>
<font color="cyan">to go more so.</font>

02:53.880 --> 02:57.159
<font color="yellow">Sam and Jack had a conversation,</font>

02:57.160 --> 03:00.079
<font color="yellow">and Jack said that he did not</font>
<font color="yellow">understand.</font>

03:00.080 --> 03:03.480
<font color="yellow">Jack said he would have stayed</font>
<font color="yellow">if he was in Sam's shoes.</font>

03:05.960 --> 03:07.999
<font color="cyan">That is fine.</font>

03:08.000 --> 03:15.319
<font color="yellow">I can't not tell you,</font>
<font color="yellow">because you are my mate.</font>

03:15.320 --> 03:18.799
<font color="cyan">I'm going</font>
<font color="cyan">to go and speak to him.</font>

03:18.800 --> 03:20.519
<font color="cyan">Jack?</font>
<c.color008000>Yes, babe.</font>

03:20.520 --> 03:26.639
<font color="yellow">I couldn't. I knew that fact in my</font>
<font color="yellow">head.</font>

03:26.640 --> 03:29.559
<font color="yellow">She is bringing it up and I can't</font>
<font color="yellow">pretend I don't know.</font>

03:29.560 --> 03:32.439
<c.color008000>I know.</font>

03:32.440 --> 03:34.679
Aw, look, isn't that nice?

03:34.680 --> 03:37.159
After being kept on his toes
for three whole weeks,

03:37.160 --> 03:40.559
Sam gets a chance to put his feet up.
But he's been through the wringer.

03:40.560 --> 03:44.719
<font color="yellow">Today has been a rollercoaster,</font>
<font color="yellow">hasn't it?</font>

03:44.720 --> 03:47.199
<font color="yellow">But I am glad you are here.</font>

03:47.200 --> 03:50.119
<font color="yellow">Hopefully you and Georgia</font>
<font color="yellow">will get through this,</font>

03:50.120 --> 03:52.959
<font color="yellow">and you will be strong if you do.</font>

03:52.960 --> 03:56.999
<font color="cyan">I can't even talk to the girls.</font>
<font color="cyan">I don't want to.</font>

03:57.000 --> 04:05.279
<font color="cyan">I have lost Georgia and I feel</font>
<font color="cyan">a bit alone.</font>

04:05.280 --> 04:09.760
<font color="yellow">I am here for you.</font>

04:12.400 --> 04:19.599
<font color="cyan">I don't know. I feel like</font>

04:19.600 --> 04:24.239
<font color="cyan">I have made a bad decision.</font>

04:24.240 --> 04:27.319
<font color="yellow">Leaving is a final decision.</font>

04:27.320 --> 04:29.919
<font color="yellow">By staying, you gave yourself more</font>
<font color="yellow">time.</font>

04:29.920 --> 04:34.479
<font color="yellow">It is a way of buying time.</font>

04:34.480 --> 04:38.519
<font color="cyan">Mate, I am stressing out.</font>
<font color="cyan">I really am.</font>

04:38.520 --> 04:41.199
My mum says it's important
to think before you speak.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.119
But she also thinks
dogs can't look up,

04:43.120 --> 04:45.079
so I wouldn't trust
everything she says,

04:45.080 --> 04:47.279
although Jack should've taken her
advice.

04:47.280 --> 04:50.359
<font color="cyan">I want you to know</font>
<font color="cyan">that Georgia has said</font>

04:50.360 --> 04:56.919
<font color="cyan">that you said to Sam that if</font>
<font color="cyan">you were in their situation today,</font>

04:56.920 --> 04:58.839
<font color="cyan">you would have stayed.</font>

04:58.840 --> 05:01.399
<font color="cyan">I think it was stupid</font>
<font color="cyan">to say that to Sam.</font>

05:01.400 --> 05:03.400
<font color="yellow">I said it to comfort him.</font>

05:08.680 --> 05:11.479
<font color="yellow">I said it to comfort him.</font>

05:11.480 --> 05:13.839
<font color="yellow">I don't know</font>
<font color="yellow">what I would have done.</font>

05:13.840 --> 05:19.159
<font color="cyan">OK, but we weren't in that position.</font>
<font color="yellow">I am giving the guy advice.</font>

05:19.160 --> 05:25.039
<font color="cyan">But by saying that, it affects me.</font>
<font color="cyan">Please be careful what you say.</font>

05:25.040 --> 05:28.879
<font color="yellow">I haven't said</font>
<font color="yellow">it's to cause a situation.</font>

05:28.880 --> 05:35.879
<font color="cyan">I know. You do not need to put</font>
<font color="cyan">yourself in that situation.</font>

05:35.880 --> 05:39.399
<font color="yellow">The guy is clearly upset,</font>

05:39.400 --> 05:45.039
<font color="yellow">and I wondered what I could do to</font>
<font color="yellow">make it seem OK.</font>

05:45.040 --> 05:46.679
<font color="yellow">I tried to level with him.</font>

05:46.680 --> 05:50.799
<font color="cyan">You can help him</font>
<font color="cyan">by not involving me.</font>

05:50.800 --> 05:56.119
<font color="yellow">My apologies.</font>

05:56.120 --> 06:00.159
<font color="cyan">Everything you say about me and you</font>
<font color="cyan">affects me. </font><font color="yellow"> I did not think.</font>

06:00.160 --> 06:06.999
<font color="cyan">It is just</font>
<font color="cyan">fuelling the fire of the situation.</font>

06:07.000 --> 06:10.559
<font color="yellow">I said things to make Sam</font>
<font color="yellow">feel comforted and stuff,</font>

06:10.560 --> 06:13.479
<font color="yellow">but it has been taken</font>
<font color="yellow">in the wrong way.</font>

06:13.480 --> 06:16.399
<font color="yellow">Out of all the couples in here,</font>

06:16.400 --> 06:21.839
<font color="yellow">Sam, George, myself and Laura are</font>
<font color="yellow">the only ones not in relationships.</font>

06:21.840 --> 06:26.359
<font color="yellow">It would be a difficult</font>
<font color="yellow">decision to make.</font>

06:26.360 --> 06:28.919
Newbies Stephanie, Laura,
Josh and Paul

06:28.920 --> 06:31.039
are about to reveal
their favourite type.

06:31.040 --> 06:33.239
My favourite type
is Times New Roman.

06:33.240 --> 06:36.159
Or if I'm feeling a little
bit wacky, Comic Sans.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.960
<font color="yellow">Have you all got a type?</font>

06:41.520 --> 06:45.799
<font color="cyan">Nice eyes, teeth, curves.</font>

06:45.800 --> 06:52.279
<font color="cyan">Initial attraction would be...</font>

06:52.280 --> 07:00.679
<font color="cyan">Alexandra, Georgia and Laura.</font>

07:00.680 --> 07:02.759
<font color="cyan">Those three.</font>

07:02.760 --> 07:05.439
<font color="yellow">My type is dark features.</font>

07:05.440 --> 07:10.999
<font color="yellow">Initial attraction, Alexandra, Kaz.</font>

07:11.000 --> 07:12.999
(LAUGHTER)

07:13.000 --> 07:16.960
<font color="cyan">Eye contact.</font>
<font color="yellow">I am trying not to!</font>

07:19.160 --> 07:20.919
<font color="yellow">Steph.</font>

07:20.920 --> 07:24.919
<font color="cyan">When the boys said Alexandra,</font>

07:24.920 --> 07:28.919
<font color="cyan">it did not worry me at all.</font>
<font color="cyan">It is a good test.</font>

07:28.920 --> 07:32.439
<font color="cyan">Things are going well but we are</font>
<font color="cyan">in a couple, not a relationship.</font>

07:32.440 --> 07:36.919
<font color="cyan">I think we're both in a position</font>

07:36.920 --> 07:40.079
<font color="cyan">where, you know, if we had a better</font>
<font color="cyan">connection with someone else</font>

07:40.080 --> 07:43.919
<font color="cyan">then we would consider it.</font>
<font color="cyan">I am not worried.</font>

07:43.920 --> 07:52.679
<font color="yellow">Initial attraction would be Jack,</font>
<font color="yellow">this Jack.</font>

07:52.680 --> 07:54.680
<c.color008000>New Jack.</font>

08:00.000 --> 08:03.040
<font color="yellow">Josh and Alex.</font>

08:04.560 --> 08:11.480
<font color="cyan">For me, Josh, Jack and Sam.</font>

08:12.760 --> 08:14.839
<font color="cyan">He was lovely on our first date.</font>

08:14.840 --> 08:18.359
<font color="cyan">He seems like a genuine guy but I</font>
<font color="cyan">want to get everyone know equally.</font>

08:18.360 --> 08:21.039
<font color="cyan">You all seem lovely.</font>

08:21.040 --> 08:27.600
<font color="yellow">Both of them fancy Jack.</font>
<font color="yellow">Standard. But I am not fazed.</font>

08:38.000 --> 08:40.318
Alex and Alex are discussing
their relationship.

08:40.320 --> 08:44.599
I have to say, what a fine figure
that Alex has, right up my street.

08:44.600 --> 08:46.719
And she seems lovely as well.

08:46.720 --> 08:50.999
<font color="yellow">Are you open to meeting the new</font>
<font color="yellow">girls? How do you feel towards them?</font>

08:51.000 --> 08:56.399
<font color="cyan">Early days. I am enjoying my time</font>
<font color="cyan">with you.</font>

08:56.400 --> 09:02.399
<font color="cyan">I wouldn't say that I am not willing</font>
<font color="cyan">to give anyone else time,</font>

09:02.400 --> 09:06.319
<font color="cyan">but I do think we are going</font>
<font color="cyan">from strength to strength.</font>

09:06.320 --> 09:09.159
<font color="cyan">I don't want to</font>
<font color="cyan">put pressure on the situation.</font>

09:09.160 --> 09:19.159
<font color="cyan">It is early stages and things are</font>
<font color="cyan">positive, but I'm not playing games.</font>

09:19.160 --> 09:21.319
It's common sense like that

09:21.320 --> 09:24.519
that put Alex and Alex in the top
four most popular couples.

09:24.520 --> 09:28.279
I can't imagine how that feels.
And neither can Wes and Megan.

09:28.280 --> 09:32.239
<font color="yellow">I wanted to talk to you about today</font>
<font color="yellow">and how you feel about it.</font>

09:32.240 --> 09:35.999
<font color="cyan">It was stressful. Again!</font>

09:36.000 --> 09:41.959
<font color="cyan">I thought my curse</font>
<font color="cyan">was striking again.</font>

09:41.960 --> 09:43.879
<font color="cyan">I thought it</font>
<font color="cyan">would happen to me and you.</font>

09:43.880 --> 09:46.039
<font color="yellow">We are</font>
<font color="yellow">boyfriend and girlfriend now,</font>

09:46.040 --> 09:49.479
<font color="yellow">so whatever happens in here</font>
<font color="yellow">is technically irrelevant.</font>

09:49.480 --> 09:53.639
<font color="yellow">I would love to spend as much time</font>
<font color="yellow">with these guys</font>

09:53.640 --> 09:59.799
<font color="yellow">and complete our journey, but we</font>
<font color="yellow">have got where we are for a reason.</font>

09:59.800 --> 10:02.359
<font color="yellow">We gravitate back to each</font>
<font color="yellow">other and it has worked out.</font>

10:02.360 --> 10:04.879
<font color="yellow">If we were not happy</font>
<font color="yellow">then we would say that.</font>

10:04.880 --> 10:10.479
<font color="yellow">But I have never been happier.</font>
<font color="yellow">Like, ever. Ever.</font>

10:10.480 --> 10:15.519
<font color="yellow">My Love Island</font>
<font color="yellow">started when I met you.</font>

10:15.520 --> 10:18.239
<font color="yellow">Honestly, I am getting</font>
<font color="yellow">deeper and deeper</font>

10:18.240 --> 10:21.120
<font color="yellow">and I am falling in love with you.</font>

10:23.240 --> 10:27.079
<font color="yellow">I feel so wet</font>
<font color="yellow">after saying that.</font>

10:27.080 --> 10:28.879
<font color="yellow">It's only been a couple of weeks.</font>

10:28.880 --> 10:32.119
<font color="yellow">But I am falling in love with you,</font>
<font color="yellow">I am not going to lie.</font>

10:32.120 --> 10:38.839
<font color="yellow">I do love you. I have been</font>
<font color="yellow">thinking it for a couple of days.</font>

10:38.840 --> 10:41.399
<font color="yellow">I've been thinking it's too</font>
<font color="yellow">early to say it,</font>

10:41.400 --> 10:48.719
<font color="yellow">and I didn't know how you felt.</font>

10:48.720 --> 10:52.479
<font color="cyan">You know I do.</font>
<font color="yellow">You know you do what?</font>

10:52.480 --> 10:57.119
<font color="cyan">Love you.</font>
<font color="cyan">I said it the other day quietly.</font>

10:57.120 --> 10:58.999
<font color="yellow">I did not hear it properly.</font>

10:59.000 --> 11:04.119
<font color="cyan">No, I do. I haven't been this happy</font>
<font color="cyan">in such a long time.</font>

11:04.120 --> 11:07.879
<font color="yellow">It is something I've</font>
<font color="yellow">wanted to say for a long time,</font>

11:07.880 --> 11:09.639
<font color="yellow">and she said it back.</font>

11:09.640 --> 11:12.840
<font color="yellow">I am buzzing!</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm the happiest man alive.</font>

11:19.720 --> 11:21.880
<font color="cyan">I am so happy.</font>
<font color="yellow">Tell me about it.</font>

11:23.120 --> 11:26.359
So, to sum up, one couple left,
four Islanders arrived,

11:26.360 --> 11:27.959
and Sam and Georgia broke up.

11:27.960 --> 11:29.799
Oh, and I had a haircut.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.439
Sam and Georgia

11:31.440 --> 11:34.999
are breaking Love Island Rule 35
Subsection 4b Paragraph 2:

11:35.000 --> 11:39.159
Former Couples Are Not Permitted
To Canoodle On Soft Furnishings.

11:39.160 --> 11:43.639
<font color="yellow">I'm worried.</font>
<font color="cyan">What are you worried about, babe?</font>

11:43.640 --> 11:45.879
<font color="yellow">I feel like I'm going to try</font>
<font color="yellow">and kiss you.</font>

11:45.880 --> 11:47.919
<font color="yellow">I'm just laying down the law now.</font>

11:47.920 --> 11:49.480
<font color="cyan">OK, babe.</font>

11:54.640 --> 11:59.200
<c.color008000># What would you do</font>
<c.color008000>if you couldn't get me back?</font>

12:01.960 --> 12:08.240
<c.color008000># You're the one who's going to lose</font>
<c.color008000>if you couldn't get me back</font>

12:09.520 --> 12:16.999
<c.color008000># That's what I wish I could do</font>
<c.color008000>to you, ooh, ooh, ooh</font>

12:17.000 --> 12:19.199
<c.color008000># You, ooh, ooh, ooh</font>

12:19.200 --> 12:20.800
<c.color008000># Ooh, ooh #</font>

12:47.440 --> 12:49.079
Still to come...

12:49.080 --> 12:51.239
Georgia's moving on.

12:51.240 --> 12:54.039
<font color="yellow">When I was coming down the</font>
<font color="yellow">stairs today, what did you think?</font>

12:54.040 --> 12:57.480
<font color="cyan">I was like,</font>
<font color="cyan">"They've picked my type."</font>

13:09.680 --> 13:13.719
It is another morning in Paradise.
Come on, you lot, rise and shine.

13:13.720 --> 13:18.240
It is time to shower, shave
and shove on that microphone.

13:24.480 --> 13:26.640
<font color="yellow">Morning.</font>

13:49.600 --> 13:52.359
<font color="yellow">I don't like it that you</font>
<font color="yellow">are not with me, I don't like it.</font>

13:52.360 --> 13:57.519
<font color="cyan">I know, babe, I know.</font>
<font color="cyan">What have we done?</font>

13:57.520 --> 13:59.839
I'll tell you what you've done,
madam,

13:59.840 --> 14:02.999
you've broken Love Island rule 35
subsection 4B paragraph 2.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.919
Meanwhile, upstairs new girl
Stephanie

14:04.920 --> 14:07.079
is getting ready for
her first full day.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.559
<font color="yellow">How did you find yesterday?</font>

14:09.560 --> 14:12.399
<font color="cyan">With Sam on my date?</font>
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

14:12.400 --> 14:15.919
<font color="cyan">It was actually really nice,</font>
<font color="cyan">like, surprisingly nice.</font>

14:15.920 --> 14:18.959
<font color="cyan">I didn't think I would like him.</font>

14:18.960 --> 14:21.919
<font color="yellow">Do you fancy him?</font>
<font color="cyan">I don't know.</font>

14:21.920 --> 14:26.479
<font color="cyan">I wouldn't say there was sparks</font>
<font color="cyan">flying, but it was definitely... Hi!</font>

14:26.480 --> 14:29.519
<font color="cyan">..not how I thought</font>
<font color="cyan">it was going to go.</font>

14:29.520 --> 14:31.559
<font color="yellow">Have you got</font>
<font color="yellow">your eye on anyone else?</font>

14:31.560 --> 14:33.439
<font color="cyan">No, not really, actually.</font>

14:33.440 --> 14:35.799
<font color="cyan">It is just completely fair</font>
<font color="cyan">game with all of them.</font>

14:35.800 --> 14:39.559
<font color="cyan">Like, literally fair game</font>
<font color="cyan">with all of them.</font>

14:39.560 --> 14:42.119
<font color="yellow">Talk to them.</font>
<font color="cyan">Yes.</font>

14:42.120 --> 14:44.279
<font color="cyan">Sam has massively surprised</font>
<font color="cyan">me, actually.</font>

14:44.280 --> 14:48.679
<font color="cyan">If he opens up a bit more</font>
<font color="cyan">and stops fannying about on the sofa</font>

14:48.680 --> 14:50.479
<font color="cyan">worrying about Georgia,</font>

14:50.480 --> 14:52.959
<font color="cyan">then maybe I can get to know him</font>
<font color="cyan">a bit better</font>

14:52.960 --> 14:56.479
<font color="cyan">and it might be in a romantic way,</font>
<font color="cyan">but I'm not too sure at the minute.</font>

14:56.480 --> 14:58.239
First impressions are important,

14:58.240 --> 15:00.439
and the first impressions
new boy Paul

15:00.440 --> 15:03.679
is about to say are some very bad
ones of James Blunt.

15:03.680 --> 15:05.679
<font color="yellow">What music do you listen to?</font>

15:05.680 --> 15:08.599
<font color="cyan">You remind me of someone</font>
<font color="cyan">who listens to James Blunt.</font>

15:08.600 --> 15:10.479
(LAUGHTER)
<font color="yellow">That is the worst thing to say!</font>

15:10.480 --> 15:12.879
<font color="cyan">You look</font>
<font color="cyan">like you listen to James Blunt.</font>

15:12.880 --> 15:14.519
<c.color008000>I split up with a girl years ago,</font>

15:14.520 --> 15:18.160
<c.color008000>and I stuck on James Blunt</font>
<c.color008000>and bawled into it.</font>

15:19.440 --> 15:21.399
<font color="yellow"># It's true!</font>

15:21.400 --> 15:26.599
<font color="yellow"># I saw your face...</font>

15:26.600 --> 15:30.199
<font color="yellow">Cool Paul, I'm going to call you.</font>
(LAUGHTER)

15:30.200 --> 15:32.719
<font color="cyan">There is definitely more of a buzz</font>
<font color="cyan">around the villa.</font>

15:32.720 --> 15:35.279
<font color="cyan">It was weird waking up today</font>

15:35.280 --> 15:37.679
<font color="cyan">and hearing voices</font>
<font color="cyan">that you are not too familiar with.</font>

15:37.680 --> 15:40.039
<font color="cyan">They seem quite nice people.</font>
<font color="cyan">Good impressions.</font>

15:40.040 --> 15:44.039
<font color="yellow">How did the date with</font>
<font color="yellow">Georgia go? Did it go well?</font>

15:44.040 --> 15:46.679
<font color="cyan">It was good, man. It was one</font>
<font color="cyan">of the best dates I've had.</font>

15:46.680 --> 15:49.759
<font color="cyan">She surprised me, definitely. I</font>
<font color="cyan">didn't think she'd be like she was.</font>

15:49.760 --> 15:52.559
<font color="cyan">I thought she was going to be</font>
<font color="cyan">more childish than she was.</font>

15:52.560 --> 15:56.519
<font color="cyan">But she is, like, grown-up,</font>

15:56.520 --> 15:59.479
<font color="cyan">and she knows what she wants.</font>
<font color="cyan">She knows what she wants.</font>

15:59.480 --> 16:01.239
<font color="yellow">What's that? </font><c.color008000> What does she want?</font>

16:01.240 --> 16:04.759
<font color="cyan">She wants someone who is loyal.</font>

16:04.760 --> 16:07.919
(LAUGHTER)
<font color="yellow">Fuck's sake!</font>

16:07.920 --> 16:10.279
<font color="cyan">And someone who she can...</font>
<font color="yellow">I love this game.</font>

16:10.280 --> 16:14.479
<font color="yellow">Do you like her, then?</font>
<font color="cyan">Do I like her?</font>

16:14.480 --> 16:17.319
<font color="cyan">I seem to, yes.</font>

16:17.320 --> 16:20.079
<font color="cyan">I want to chat to a few</font>
<font color="cyan">of the other girls today</font>

16:20.080 --> 16:22.519
<font color="cyan">and see who gives me the most back</font>
<font color="cyan">and go for that.</font>

16:22.520 --> 16:26.719
<font color="yellow">What about you, cool Paul?</font>
<c.color008000>Good.</font>

16:26.720 --> 16:29.359
<c.color008000>Same with you, yes,</font>
<c.color008000>she did surprise me.</font>

16:29.360 --> 16:32.919
<c.color008000>I didn't think she was</font>
<c.color008000>going to be quite so open.</font>

16:32.920 --> 16:36.119
<c.color008000>I mean, she has thrown her toys out</font>
<c.color008000>of the pram a few times in here,</font>

16:36.120 --> 16:39.759
<c.color008000>but when you talk to her,</font>
<c.color008000>there is maturity there.</font>

16:39.760 --> 16:42.080
<c.color008000>She is a nice girl.</font>

16:45.200 --> 16:48.519
ITV2 is nothing if not diverse,
so for the next minute,

16:48.520 --> 16:51.120
please sit back and enjoy
a Love Island first.

16:53.960 --> 16:57.039
<font color="yellow">Have you travelled much?</font>
<font color="cyan">I've been quite lucky.</font>

16:57.040 --> 16:58.959
<font color="cyan">I've done quite a bit</font>
<font color="cyan">over the years.</font>

16:58.960 --> 17:01.839
<font color="cyan">I did a bit with work as well. I</font>
<font color="cyan">worked in Thailand for four months</font>

17:01.840 --> 17:06.398
<font color="cyan">in an A&amp;E department with a</font>
<font color="cyan">hyperbaric chamber. That was cool.</font>

17:06.400 --> 17:09.679
<font color="yellow">Alex likes Laura.</font>

17:09.680 --> 17:13.759
<font color="yellow">They've been chatting</font>
<font color="yellow">for a good 10 minutes.</font>

17:13.760 --> 17:18.358
<font color="cyan">When we go skiing, we go and</font>
<font color="cyan">watch the skiing in the evenings.</font>

17:18.359 --> 17:23.598
<font color="cyan">We always put surfing and</font>
<font color="cyan">ski films on. I watched two of them.</font>

17:23.599 --> 17:25.319
<font color="cyan">They go in a car and drive around,</font>

17:25.319 --> 17:27.999
<font color="cyan">and it's supposed to be a funny...</font>
<font color="cyan">It's a classic.</font>

17:28.000 --> 17:30.199
<font color="yellow">Erm... Endless Summer?</font>
<font color="cyan">That is it.</font>

17:30.200 --> 17:33.159
<font color="cyan">New girls have come in, and Laura</font>
<font color="cyan">seems really nice in particular.</font>

17:33.160 --> 17:35.479
<font color="cyan">She's blonde,</font>
<font color="cyan">blue-eyed, natural looking.</font>

17:35.480 --> 17:37.839
<font color="cyan">She loves swimming, loves the sea.</font>

17:37.840 --> 17:42.399
<font color="cyan">I guess, yes, she's the kind of girl</font>
<font color="cyan">that is quite similar to my type.</font>

17:42.400 --> 17:46.359
Britain, get ready for another
Love Island first -

17:46.360 --> 17:48.639
Georgia admitting
she's been in the wrong.

17:48.640 --> 17:52.599
<font color="yellow">It really irritates me that you're</font>
<font color="yellow">always right and I'm fucking wrong.</font>

17:52.600 --> 17:55.479
<font color="cyan">What? </font><font color="yellow"> You are always right</font>
<font color="yellow">and I'm always wrong!</font>

17:55.480 --> 17:57.319
<font color="yellow">It is so annoying.</font>
<font color="cyan">How am I always right?</font>

17:57.320 --> 17:59.359
<font color="yellow">I don't know. I'm always doing bad</font>
<font color="yellow">things</font>

17:59.360 --> 18:01.559
<font color="yellow">and you're pulling</font>
<font color="yellow">me up about it saying,</font>

18:01.560 --> 18:04.719
<font color="yellow">"G, you've done this wrong again."</font>
<font color="cyan">That is what I'm here for.</font>

18:04.720 --> 18:07.879
<font color="yellow">End of the day, Dani</font>
<font color="yellow">is always right</font>

18:07.880 --> 18:11.359
<font color="yellow">when it comes to me asking her</font>
<font color="yellow">for advice, which is so annoying.</font>

18:11.360 --> 18:13.479
<font color="yellow">However, that is why</font>
<font color="yellow">she is my mate,</font>

18:13.480 --> 18:16.319
<font color="yellow">because she puts me back</font>
<font color="yellow">on the straight and narrow,</font>

18:16.320 --> 18:18.039
<font color="yellow">and that is why I need her.</font>

18:18.040 --> 18:24.599
<font color="yellow">I came back from the dates</font>

18:24.600 --> 18:27.439
<font color="yellow">and you know when you want someone</font>
<font color="yellow">more when you haven't got it?</font>

18:27.440 --> 18:29.239
<font color="yellow">I wanted it</font>
<font color="yellow">because I didn't have it.</font>

18:29.240 --> 18:32.239
<font color="yellow">Last night I was thinking in bed,</font>
<font color="yellow">and I thought</font>

18:32.240 --> 18:35.559
<font color="yellow">if we were meant to be,</font>
<font color="yellow">we would have left.</font>

18:35.560 --> 18:39.199
<font color="cyan">Yes. If you were 100%,</font>
<font color="cyan">"I want to be with him.</font>

18:39.200 --> 18:41.319
<font color="cyan">There is nothing that is going</font>
<font color="cyan">to break us."</font>

18:41.320 --> 18:43.879
<font color="cyan">I know you, and you'd have gone.</font>
<font color="yellow">Yes, exactly.</font>

18:43.880 --> 18:45.839
<font color="cyan">And that is what</font>
<font color="cyan">I was saying to you.</font>

18:45.840 --> 18:49.599
<font color="cyan">You can sit there and say you are</font>
<font color="cyan">smitten. "I'm smitten, boo."</font>

18:49.600 --> 18:51.759
<font color="cyan">But you are not smitten,</font>
<font color="cyan">boo, are you?</font>

18:51.760 --> 18:53.959
<font color="cyan">Cos you would</font> <font color="cyan">have fucked off.</font>

18:53.960 --> 18:56.319
<font color="yellow">I have got to get</font>
<font color="yellow">Sam out of my head now.</font>

18:56.320 --> 18:59.159
<font color="yellow">I've got to get to know these boys.</font>
<font color="cyan">Is that what you're going to do?</font>

18:59.160 --> 19:01.639
<font color="cyan">Forget about Sam?</font>
<font color="yellow">Yes. </font><font color="cyan"> Really, George?</font>

19:01.640 --> 19:03.399
<font color="yellow">The way I look at it now is</font>

19:03.400 --> 19:06.279
<font color="yellow">we've got to get to know other</font>
<font color="yellow">people. We've made our bed,</font>

19:06.280 --> 19:07.959
<font color="yellow">and as you say,</font>
<font color="yellow">when you make your bed,</font>

19:07.960 --> 19:10.359
<font color="yellow">you lie in it.</font>
<font color="cyan">Yes, cold, and on your own.</font>

19:10.360 --> 19:13.559
<font color="cyan">Does Sam know you are putting</font>
<font color="cyan">him into the back of your mind?</font>

19:13.560 --> 19:15.279
<font color="cyan">Getting to know Josh?</font>

19:15.280 --> 19:16.959
<font color="yellow">I think he's got to do the same,</font>
<font color="yellow">Dan.</font>

19:16.960 --> 19:18.679
<font color="yellow">I have got</font>
<font color="yellow">to go for it, haven't I?</font>

19:18.680 --> 19:21.239
<font color="yellow">At the end of the day, I am back</font>
<font color="yellow">in here as a single person</font>

19:21.240 --> 19:25.199
<font color="yellow">and I'm only going to get to know</font>
<font color="yellow">other people in the villa</font>

19:25.200 --> 19:29.719
<font color="yellow">if I try to avoid Sam.</font>

19:29.720 --> 19:35.080
<font color="yellow">Is it really weird being here?</font>
<font color="cyan">No.</font>

19:39.160 --> 19:41.160
<font color="yellow">Oh, my God.</font>

19:45.200 --> 19:47.799
<font color="yellow">Funny. </font><font color="cyan"> Why?</font>

19:47.800 --> 19:51.439
<font color="yellow">You are just funny, you make</font>
<font color="yellow">me chuckle. It is not a bad thing.</font>

19:51.440 --> 19:54.519
<font color="cyan">Don't take yourself too seriously.</font>
<font color="yellow">I don't take myself too seriously.</font>

19:54.520 --> 19:57.919
<font color="cyan">Me neither.</font>
<font color="yellow">There we go, then.</font>

19:57.920 --> 19:59.839
<font color="cyan">I am always happy.</font>

19:59.840 --> 20:04.199
<font color="cyan">When I'm talking to Georgia, I feel</font>
<font color="cyan">like I'm getting a lot back from her</font>

20:04.200 --> 20:07.439
<font color="cyan">but she is still holding</font>
<font color="cyan">her cards close to her chest.</font>

20:07.440 --> 20:09.359
<font color="cyan">She is not giving away too much.</font>

20:09.360 --> 20:12.919
<font color="cyan">It is good cos I like a challenge,</font>
<font color="cyan">and I will crack the code.</font>

20:12.920 --> 20:14.639
<font color="cyan">100,000%.</font>

20:14.640 --> 20:17.759
<font color="cyan">When I was coming down the stairs</font>
<font color="cyan">the other day, what did you think?</font>

20:17.760 --> 20:20.199
<font color="yellow">Like, they've picked my type.</font>

20:20.200 --> 20:25.959
(LAUGHTER)
<font color="yellow">You are and everyone here knows it.</font>

20:25.960 --> 20:29.119
<font color="yellow">They're all, "What do you think of</font>
<font color="yellow">Josh? He's definitely your type, G."</font>

20:29.120 --> 20:32.480
<font color="cyan">Glad. Brownie points.</font>

20:36.240 --> 20:39.239
This situation is clear.
Sam and Georgia have made their bed

20:39.240 --> 20:43.239
and they are not allowed to lie in it
together, so how is Sam feeling now?

20:43.240 --> 20:46.839
<font color="yellow">Me and Georgia</font>
<font color="yellow">have made this decision</font>

20:46.840 --> 20:50.919
<font color="yellow">and maybe this is, like,</font>
<font color="yellow">our big ultimate last test.</font>

20:50.920 --> 20:54.719
<font color="yellow">But I feel like now I am back here</font>
<font color="yellow">today,</font>

20:54.720 --> 20:58.479
<font color="yellow">I don't know</font>
<font color="yellow">if this was the right decision.</font>

20:58.480 --> 21:01.359
<font color="cyan">This was never going to be easy.</font>
<font color="cyan">You must have known that.</font>

21:01.360 --> 21:04.719
<font color="yellow">I think I didn't take into</font>
<font color="yellow">consideration fully</font>

21:04.720 --> 21:07.919
<font color="yellow">the consequences of this.</font>
<c.color008000>I think you do need to try,</font>

21:07.920 --> 21:12.479
<c.color008000>Cos if Georgia goes on dates</font>
<c.color008000>and say she likes someone else,</font>

21:12.480 --> 21:14.559
<c.color008000>you are in the shit, aren't you?</font>
<font color="yellow">Yes.</font>

21:14.560 --> 21:17.159
<font color="cyan">If you and Georgia are meant</font>
<font color="cyan">to be, it will happen,</font>

21:17.160 --> 21:21.559
<font color="cyan">but I think what harm would it do</font>
<font color="cyan">you getting to know the other girls?</font>

21:21.560 --> 21:24.039
<font color="cyan">Get to know them, have a laugh</font>
<font color="cyan">with them, have fun,</font>

21:24.040 --> 21:27.279
<font color="cyan">not mope and wish you was with</font>
<font color="cyan">Georgia when she's going on dates.</font>

21:27.280 --> 21:30.719
<font color="cyan">I said, "You've got to go for it,</font>
<font color="cyan">mate, you might surprise yourself."</font>

21:30.720 --> 21:32.439
<font color="cyan">He's probably open to it.</font>

21:32.440 --> 21:34.759
<font color="cyan">"If at the end of all that,</font>
<font color="cyan">you still like Georgia,</font>

21:34.760 --> 21:36.439
<font color="cyan">then it is definitely meant to be."</font>

21:36.440 --> 21:39.240
<font color="yellow">Steph is proper my type.</font>

21:40.440 --> 21:43.759
<font color="yellow">Laura's personality is more</font>
<font color="yellow">the one I would go for,</font>

21:43.760 --> 21:46.119
<font color="yellow">so I've got two really good options</font>
<font color="yellow">there.</font>

21:46.120 --> 21:48.479
<font color="yellow">At the end of the day, like,</font>
<font color="yellow">I do still like Georgia.</font>

21:48.480 --> 21:51.239
<font color="yellow">Those feelings are not going</font>
<font color="yellow">to switch off overnight.</font>

21:51.240 --> 21:57.119
<font color="yellow">We made this decision, and I</font>
<font color="yellow">need to get to know someone else.</font>

21:57.120 --> 21:59.679
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to make it clear that,</font>

21:59.680 --> 22:04.399
<font color="yellow">because we have been on this date,</font>
<font color="yellow">which I thought was good.</font>

22:04.400 --> 22:09.239
<font color="yellow">I think we are quite similar in</font>
<font color="yellow">terms of how we live. </font><font color="cyan"> Definitely.</font>

22:09.240 --> 22:13.479
<font color="yellow">I wanted to make it clear that I do</font>
<font color="yellow">want to get to know you in that way.</font>

22:13.480 --> 22:17.199
<font color="cyan">It went really well.</font>
<font color="cyan">Yes, I was happy.</font>

22:17.200 --> 22:19.519
<font color="yellow">You are a very confident girl</font>
<font color="yellow">and that is what I go for,</font>

22:19.520 --> 22:22.119
<font color="yellow">someone who comes in here,</font>
<font color="yellow">doesn't give a shit,</font>

22:22.120 --> 22:23.799
<font color="yellow">just wants to get to know people.</font>

22:23.800 --> 22:26.719
<font color="yellow">I like new Laura</font>
<font color="yellow">and we have similar mindsets.</font>

22:26.720 --> 22:29.799
<font color="yellow">She is a bit more chilled</font>
<font color="yellow">and I think she is very mature.</font>

22:29.800 --> 22:32.599
<font color="yellow">Let's just get to know each other.</font>

22:32.600 --> 22:35.239
<font color="yellow">Because I have been hung up on</font>
<font color="yellow">Georgia for so long,</font>

22:35.240 --> 22:38.959
<font color="yellow">and then it happened, I've then</font>
<font color="yellow">forgotten a bit about why I'm here.</font>

22:38.960 --> 22:41.079
<font color="yellow">I owe it to myself</font>

22:41.080 --> 22:45.999
<font color="yellow">to get to know as many people as I</font>
<font color="yellow">can and find what's best for me.</font>

22:46.000 --> 22:47.919
<font color="cyan">That's what I wanted to know,</font>

22:47.920 --> 22:53.919
<font color="cyan">whether you were just going to stay</font>
<font color="cyan">in here and stay focused on Georgia.</font>

22:53.920 --> 22:56.359
<font color="yellow">Even though it has been good,</font>

22:56.360 --> 23:01.879
<font color="yellow">I don't want to be in a stressful</font>
<font color="yellow">relationship, you know what I mean?</font>

23:01.880 --> 23:05.279
<font color="yellow">I want to be happy</font>
<font color="yellow">as much as I can be.</font>

23:05.280 --> 23:08.519
<font color="cyan">There is a reason why</font>
<font color="cyan">we were in the bottom three.</font>

23:08.520 --> 23:10.999
<font color="cyan">There's a reason why people thought</font>
<font color="cyan">I liked her more.</font>

23:11.000 --> 23:14.479
<font color="cyan">There's a reason</font>
<font color="cyan">why other people in the villa</font>

23:14.480 --> 23:17.279
<font color="cyan">chose Wes and Meg -</font>
<font color="cyan">there are these reasons.</font>

23:17.280 --> 23:20.919
<font color="cyan">And I think that I've tried</font>
<font color="cyan">to fight that, and I shouldn't.</font>

23:20.920 --> 23:25.920
<font color="cyan">I should maybe take a step back and</font>
<font color="cyan">think, OK, I need to focus on me.</font>

23:32.560 --> 23:34.240
(LAUGHTER)

23:43.960 --> 23:47.199
When boys are attracted to girls,
they give off subtle signs,

23:47.200 --> 23:49.639
barely detectable to the naked eye.

23:49.640 --> 23:53.199
Watch closely and see if you can
spot any in the following scene.

24:23.640 --> 24:25.759
<font color="yellow">Fucking hell, bruv.</font>

24:25.760 --> 24:30.359
<font color="cyan">Breathe. It's good. It's cool.</font>

24:30.360 --> 24:32.759
<font color="yellow">Fuck's sake, man. Fucking hell.</font>

24:32.760 --> 24:36.039
<font color="yellow">The new girls, new Lauren and</font>
<font color="yellow">Stephanie, they are both fit.</font>

24:36.040 --> 24:37.839
<font color="yellow">They're both attractive.</font>

24:37.840 --> 24:40.639
<font color="yellow">It's always nice</font>
<font color="yellow">to have new faces in here.</font>

24:40.640 --> 24:42.599
<font color="yellow">Yeah, we've welcomed them in.</font>

24:42.600 --> 24:44.880
<font color="cyan">Oh, my God,</font>
<font color="cyan">you can blow bubbles, look.</font>

24:46.440 --> 24:49.600
(BOTTLE WHISTLES)

24:51.920 --> 24:55.599
Bubble blowing is a clear breach
of Love Island rule 25

subsection 3a paragraph 7 -

24:58.040 --> 25:01.079
water bottles are to be used
for hydration purposes only.

25:01.080 --> 25:04.759
<font color="cyan">I think Steph likes Jack.</font>

25:04.760 --> 25:09.959
<font color="cyan">But Jack is not gonna go there.</font>
<font color="cyan">Because he would be stupid, I think.</font>

25:09.960 --> 25:12.279
<font color="cyan">He's not going anywhere.</font>

25:12.280 --> 25:14.839
<font color="yellow">What's the craic, Jack?</font>

25:14.840 --> 25:17.879
<c.color008000>Me and Laura have a mad connection,</font>
<c.color008000>right? I feel it.</font>

25:17.880 --> 25:22.199
<c.color008000>I have to think, what is going</font>
<c.color008000>to work the most on the outside?</font>

25:22.200 --> 25:25.199
<c.color008000>Don't get it twisted,</font>
<c.color008000>I do care about Laura.</font>

25:25.200 --> 25:29.039
<font color="cyan">We know that, bruv. If you and Laura</font>
<font color="cyan">are happy, you could be happier.</font>

25:29.040 --> 25:32.159
<font color="yellow">You know, you can't kid yourself</font>
<font color="yellow">who you're attracted to.</font>

25:32.160 --> 25:34.039
<font color="yellow">I know you're attracted to Laura.</font>

25:34.040 --> 25:36.079

<font color="yellow">to someone else,</font>

25:36.080 --> 25:39.959
<font color="yellow">don't live a lie, or let it slide.</font>
<font color="yellow">It's about finding what you want.</font>

25:39.960 --> 25:43.839
<c.color008000>I'm not unhappy.</font>
<c.color008000>That's the thing, I'm not unhappy.</font>

25:43.840 --> 25:46.119
<font color="yellow">I was this, this was me,</font>
<font color="yellow">I said I'm not unhappy.</font>

<font color="yellow">I was not unhappy, but I could have</font>
<font color="yellow">been happier. I was right.</font>

25:49.280 --> 25:53.679
<font color="yellow">When you know that you could be</font>
<font color="yellow">happier, we haven't got time.</font>

25:53.680 --> 25:56.799
<font color="yellow">And it will be ballsy as fuck</font>
<font color="yellow">but you will fucking...</font>

25:56.800 --> 25:59.279
<font color="yellow">Me and him have both done</font>
<font color="yellow">ballsy things and it's paid off.</font>

25:59.280 --> 26:02.519
<font color="yellow">Everyone who's done something ballsy</font>

<font color="cyan">That's it.</font>

26:09.960 --> 26:11.959
<font color="cyan">Buy the wedding dress, yeah.</font>

26:11.960 --> 26:16.039
<font color="yellow">See that there? Would Josh</font>
<font color="yellow">have got that from Georgia? No.</font>

26:16.040 --> 26:17.959
<font color="cyan">Would have been poisoned.</font>

26:17.960 --> 26:20.919
<font color="yellow">Did he try something else</font>
<font color="yellow">and took a risk? Yeah.</font>

26:20.920 --> 26:25.039
<font color="yellow">It's not about security. That's</font>
<font color="yellow">the fucking reward, there it is.</font>

26:25.040 --> 26:28.959
<font color="cyan">That's the reward.</font>
<font color="cyan">I would risk it all for that.</font>

26:28.960 --> 26:32.359
<c.color008000>At the moment with Laura,</font>
<c.color008000>we've got a good vibe,</font>

26:32.360 --> 26:34.559
<c.color008000>there's a good connection</font>
<c.color008000>with me and her.</font>

26:34.560 --> 26:37.199
<c.color008000>These new girls have come in</font>
<c.color008000>and I said to Lor,</font>

26:37.200 --> 26:40.519
<c.color008000>whatever happens, in this villa</font>
<c.color008000>I will be 100% honest with you.</font>

26:40.520 --> 26:42.719
<c.color008000>I'm going to continue to do that.</font>

26:42.720 --> 26:45.319
<c.color008000>So we'll just have to wait and see.</font>

26:45.320 --> 26:47.319
Laura's been released on bail

26:47.320 --> 26:50.119
pending further investigation
of the water bottle incident

26:50.120 --> 26:52.639
and she's now talking
to new boy Paul.

26:52.640 --> 26:55.959
<font color="yellow">Travelling is...</font>
<font color="cyan">Exhausting.</font>

26:55.960 --> 26:58.559
<font color="yellow">Yes. It is exhausting. I mean...</font>

26:58.560 --> 27:00.759
<font color="cyan">It is great and I get why people</font>
<font color="cyan">want to do it.</font>

27:00.760 --> 27:03.479
<font color="cyan">But you do learn</font>
<font color="cyan">where you like you don't like.</font>

27:03.480 --> 27:06.999
<font color="yellow">Japan? </font><font color="cyan"> That's the only</font>
<font color="cyan">place I haven't been.</font>

27:07.000 --> 27:10.959
<font color="yellow">I went there earlier this year.</font>
<font color="yellow">It's one of the most surreal...</font>

27:10.960 --> 27:14.599
<font color="cyan">Is it a very futuristic, like, so</font>
<font color="cyan">far forward with everything, like?</font>

27:14.600 --> 27:16.879
<font color="yellow">When you go there,</font>
<font color="yellow">I kind of wanted this experience</font>

27:16.880 --> 27:18.599
<font color="yellow">of walking into</font>
<font color="yellow">the complete unknown</font>

27:18.600 --> 27:20.679
<font color="yellow">Because there is</font>
<font color="yellow">a very different culture</font>

27:20.680 --> 27:23.799
<font color="yellow">and the language is so different.</font>

27:23.800 --> 27:27.999
<font color="yellow">So going there, I wanted to really</font>
<font color="yellow">be put in a difficult place. </font><font color="cyan"> Yeah.</font>

27:28.000 --> 27:30.519
<font color="yellow">And it's not as hard</font>
<font color="yellow">to get by as you may think.</font>

27:30.520 --> 27:33.079
<font color="yellow">But they do, they get it right,</font>
<font color="yellow">you know? So clean out there.</font>

27:33.080 --> 27:35.879
<font color="yellow">I had, actually, really nice</font>
<font color="yellow">conversation with Laura.</font>

27:35.880 --> 27:38.799
<font color="yellow">Obviously, there is,</font>
<font color="yellow">she has that connection to Jack.</font>

27:38.800 --> 27:42.719
<font color="yellow">So getting that time to spend</font>
<font color="yellow">is quite difficult.</font>

27:42.720 --> 27:45.479
<font color="yellow">But she's a really nice girl,</font>
<font color="yellow">actually.</font>

27:45.480 --> 27:47.679
<font color="yellow">So that could be</font>
<font color="yellow">an interesting one, for sure.</font>

27:47.680 --> 27:52.319
<font color="cyan">I just think, I've really liked</font>
<font color="cyan">these new people that have come in,</font>

27:52.320 --> 27:54.159
<font color="cyan">I do. I really like them.</font>

27:54.160 --> 27:59.039
<font color="yellow">I'll be honest with you,</font>
<font color="yellow">they're fit. The boys, they're fit.</font>

27:59.040 --> 28:03.119
<font color="cyan">What's... I can imagine, actually,</font>
<font color="cyan">what Wes and Josh's chat is.</font>

28:03.120 --> 28:05.639
<font color="yellow">They're telling him to crack on</font>
<font color="yellow">and stop being so closed.</font>

28:05.640 --> 28:09.519
<font color="cyan">I think Laura and Jack are worried</font>
<font color="cyan">about letting each other down,</font>

28:09.520 --> 28:12.319
<font color="cyan">when really...</font>
<font color="yellow">Worried about what people think.</font>

28:12.320 --> 28:16.519
<c.color008000>We know they're not into each other.</font>
<c.color008000>They don't kiss in bed, girls!</font>

28:16.520 --> 28:20.519
<font color="yellow">You can tell. When you spend every</font>
<font color="yellow">day with people, you can tell.</font>

28:20.520 --> 28:23.919
<c.color008000>They don't spend any time together.</font>
<font color="yellow">Yeah.</font>

28:23.920 --> 28:26.639
<font color="cyan">I feel like when I see</font>
<font color="cyan">Laura talking to Paul,</font>

28:26.640 --> 28:28.959
<font color="cyan">she'd be an idiot</font>
<font color="cyan">to not get to know Paul.</font>

28:28.960 --> 28:31.279
<font color="cyan">Laura and Jack are</font>
<font color="cyan">at different stages of their life.</font>

28:31.280 --> 28:34.319
<font color="cyan">I don't think Jack, I mean, I don't</font>
<font color="cyan">know what they talk about in bed</font>

28:34.320 --> 28:37.679
<font color="cyan">or what they talk about one-on-one,</font>
<font color="cyan">but they are at different stages.</font>

28:37.680 --> 28:40.119
<font color="cyan">I feel like she is settling a bit</font>
<font color="cyan">with Jack.</font>

28:40.120 --> 28:43.239
<font color="cyan">I definitely think</font>
<font color="cyan">Laura is suited to Paul.</font>

28:43.240 --> 28:47.919
<font color="cyan">He is 31, I know it's not about age,</font>
<font color="cyan">but Laura wants to settle down.</font>

28:47.920 --> 28:51.719
<font color="cyan">Meet someone. That's what she's</font>
<font color="cyan">always wanted. Laura described that.</font>

28:51.720 --> 28:54.399
<font color="cyan">I feel like Paul</font>
<font color="cyan">would be good for her, I really do.</font>

28:54.400 --> 28:59.360
<font color="cyan">Honestly, hands on heart, you know</font>
<font color="cyan">what I'm going to say. I like Paul.</font>

29:01.440 --> 29:06.759
<font color="yellow">I like Paul too.</font>
<c.color008000>You get with Paul then?</font>

29:06.760 --> 29:09.159
<font color="yellow">No, no, no. I'm saying, no.</font>

29:09.160 --> 29:11.079
<font color="cyan">I know you and Jack have your thing</font>

29:11.080 --> 29:15.200
<font color="cyan">and I would never interrupt.</font>
<font color="cyan">But I don't know, Lor, Paul's a man.</font>

29:22.760 --> 29:25.079
<font color="yellow">When I'm around Paul?</font>
<font color="yellow">I've only spoken to him once.</font>

29:25.080 --> 29:26.839
<font color="cyan">I know, but, I don't know.</font>

29:26.840 --> 29:31.279
<c.color008000>Would you not be more open to,</font>
<c.color008000>like, getting to know him more?</font>

29:31.280 --> 29:33.279
<font color="yellow">Not really.</font>

29:33.280 --> 29:38.399
<font color="yellow">This has really fucking pissed me</font>
<font color="yellow">off now.</font>

29:38.400 --> 29:42.519
<font color="yellow">Everyone just sticks their nose in</font>
<font color="yellow">and it's just annoying.</font>

29:42.520 --> 29:45.999
<font color="cyan">It's not about... It's just</font>
<font color="cyan">the fact... Trying to guide you.</font>

29:46.000 --> 29:48.999
<font color="yellow">But you're just trying to push me</font>
<font color="yellow">in the direction of someone else.</font>

29:49.000 --> 29:50.919
<font color="yellow">I don't appreciate it.</font>

29:50.920 --> 29:53.119
<font color="cyan">Laura is so defensive of Jack.</font>

29:53.120 --> 29:56.319
<font color="cyan">It's like you cannot do one thing...</font>
<font color="cyan">He does not do one thing wrong.</font>

29:56.320 --> 29:58.799
<font color="cyan">I know for a fact that Jack</font>
<font color="cyan">would break Laura's heart.</font>

29:58.800 --> 30:01.199
<font color="cyan">He's at a completely different</font>
<font color="cyan">stage of his life.</font>

30:01.200 --> 30:04.839
<font color="cyan">He wants to go partying, clubbing,</font>
<font color="cyan">Paul's folding his washing up!</font>

30:04.840 --> 30:07.799
<font color="cyan">He has his own flat, he wants</font>
<font color="cyan">to move forward with a woman.</font>

30:07.800 --> 30:09.719
<font color="cyan">But I can't explain it to her</font>

30:09.720 --> 30:12.439
<font color="cyan">cos she just gets really</font>
<font color="cyan">defensive, puts her head down</font>

30:12.440 --> 30:15.239
<font color="cyan">and literally looks like she wants</font>
<font color="cyan">to attack you like an animal.</font>

30:15.240 --> 30:20.559
<font color="yellow">I cannot pursue someone else</font>
<font color="yellow">while I'm still pursuing Jack.</font>

30:20.560 --> 30:23.199
<font color="cyan">That's fine.</font>
<font color="cyan">Everyone wants you to be happy, Lor,</font>

30:23.200 --> 30:25.159
<font color="cyan">after what happened</font>
<font color="cyan">with Megan and Wes.</font>

30:25.160 --> 30:28.399
<font color="cyan">That hurt you, I know, that broke</font>
<font color="cyan">my heart when you was hurting.</font>

30:28.400 --> 30:31.079
<font color="yellow">I just wish you guys</font>
<font color="yellow">could just enjoy, like,</font>

30:31.080 --> 30:35.359
<font color="yellow">and see me and Jack being good</font>
<font color="yellow">instead of everyone, like,</font>

30:35.360 --> 30:38.199
<font color="yellow">having so many opinions against it.</font>

30:38.200 --> 30:41.519
<font color="yellow">I'm like, for fuck's sake, guys.</font>
<font color="yellow">It's like, I'm happy with Jack</font>

30:41.520 --> 30:44.679
<font color="yellow">and I don't really need to be</font>
<font color="yellow">jumping ship.</font>

30:44.680 --> 30:46.999
<font color="yellow">Like, I just don't</font>
<font color="yellow">feel the need for it.</font>

30:47.000 --> 30:51.079
<font color="yellow">And I just want people</font>
<font color="yellow">to just shut up.</font>

30:51.080 --> 30:54.479
Jack's talking to new girl Stephanie
and he's feeling reflective.

30:54.480 --> 30:56.879
I mean not
Stephanie-sunglasses-reflective,

30:56.880 --> 30:58.599
that's not humanly possible.

30:58.600 --> 31:00.999
<font color="yellow">How you think you and Laura</font>
<font color="yellow">are at the minute?</font>

31:01.000 --> 31:04.959
<font color="cyan">It's a very, very, you know,</font>
<font color="cyan">difficult thing.</font>

31:04.960 --> 31:07.839
<font color="cyan">Because you have to think what would</font>
<font color="cyan">work outside as well.</font>

31:07.840 --> 31:10.679
<font color="cyan">Like, it's all very nice</font>
<font color="cyan">coming in here, you know,</font>

31:10.680 --> 31:13.999
<font color="cyan">it's easy for people to couple up</font>
<font color="cyan">and ride it out as far as they go</font>

31:14.000 --> 31:16.319
<font color="cyan">or treat it</font>
<font color="cyan">as a holiday romance and stuff.</font>

31:16.320 --> 31:19.399
<font color="cyan">But that's not really why I'm here,</font>
<font color="cyan">you do you know what I mean?</font>

31:19.400 --> 31:21.759
<font color="cyan">I'm trying</font>
<font color="cyan">to fucking find something,</font>

31:21.760 --> 31:23.879
<font color="cyan">a connection with somebody.</font>

31:23.880 --> 31:26.479
<font color="yellow">Are you, like, open</font>
<font color="yellow">to getting to know other people</font>

31:26.480 --> 31:28.479
<font color="yellow">or are you a closed book</font>
<font color="yellow">at this point?</font>

31:28.480 --> 31:30.919
<font color="cyan">I'm not a closed book</font>
<font color="cyan">because it wouldn't make sense.</font>

31:30.920 --> 31:33.359
<font color="cyan">Me and her have discussed,</font>
<font color="cyan">we're not in a relationship.</font>

31:33.360 --> 31:35.759
<font color="cyan">We're not in love. Do you know what</font>
<font color="cyan">I mean? We know that.</font>

31:35.760 --> 31:38.879
{\an3}<font color="yellow">It would be nice to get to know you,</font>
<font color="yellow">and all the other guys.</font>

31:38.880 --> 31:41.639
<font color="yellow">I mean, it's definitely good news</font>
<font color="yellow">for me.</font>

31:41.640 --> 31:45.719
<font color="yellow">I've said from the beginning</font>
<font color="yellow">he's someone I would fancy.</font>

31:45.720 --> 31:47.879
<font color="yellow">And he just seems really fun, like,</font>

31:47.880 --> 31:50.479
<font color="yellow">I want to be with someone</font>
<font color="yellow">who makes me laugh and is bit silly.</font>

31:50.480 --> 31:52.959
<font color="yellow">I've kind of been watching him</font>
<font color="yellow">a little bit.</font>

31:52.960 --> 31:55.479
<font color="yellow">Like, not in a creepy way.</font>
<font color="yellow">I've been watching him today.</font>

31:55.480 --> 31:57.639
<font color="yellow">He is just, like, he's silly</font>
<font color="yellow">and he's fun.</font>

31:57.640 --> 32:00.680
<font color="yellow">And that's just what I'm here for,</font>
<font color="yellow">someone who makes me laugh.</font>

32:04.160 --> 32:07.639
<c.color008000>Hey. Oh, for fuck's sake.</font>

32:07.640 --> 32:09.959
<font color="yellow">I'm just not very forward with guys.</font>

32:09.960 --> 32:13.239
<font color="yellow">I haven't been with a lot of guys,</font>
<font color="yellow">don't date around. It's just not me.</font>

32:13.240 --> 32:14.959
<font color="cyan">That's fine, that's good.</font>

32:14.960 --> 32:17.119
<font color="yellow">I like to get to know, like,</font>
<font color="yellow">a few guys really well</font>

32:17.120 --> 32:19.359
<font color="yellow">rather than loads of them....</font>
<c.color008000>Hey.</font>

32:19.360 --> 32:23.359
<c.color008000>Sorry to interrupt.</font>
<c.color008000>Can you come with me for a sec?</font>

32:23.360 --> 32:25.399
<font color="cyan">Yeah. Cool.</font>

32:25.400 --> 32:27.039
<c.color008000>I don't know where my bottle is.</font>

32:27.040 --> 32:29.439
<c.color008000>You can stay here if you want.</font>
<font color="yellow">No, babe, it's cool.</font>

32:29.440 --> 32:31.159
<c.color008000>Shall we just sit here, then?</font>

32:31.160 --> 32:36.519
<font color="yellow">Chat you in a bit, guys.</font>
<c.color008000>It's really hot.</font>

32:36.520 --> 32:38.199
<c.color008000>Mate.</font>
<font color="cyan">Talk to me.</font>

32:38.200 --> 32:40.639
<c.color008000>Everyone's fucking driving me mad.</font>
<font color="cyan">What's happened?</font>

32:40.640 --> 32:43.759
<c.color008000>Dani and Alexandra have just, like,</font>
<c.color008000>pulled me</font>

32:43.760 --> 32:46.479
<c.color008000>and then like, "You know, Laura,</font>

32:46.480 --> 32:49.479
<c.color008000>we really think you and Paul</font>
<c.color008000>would be suited.</font>

32:49.480 --> 32:52.639
<c.color008000>Like, you really need to,</font>
<c.color008000>like, pursue that."</font>

32:52.640 --> 32:55.479
<c.color008000>And I was like,</font>
<c.color008000>"Are you fucking serious?"</font>

32:55.480 --> 32:59.479
<c.color008000>I was like, "Why, just because</font>
<c.color008000>he's older? Are you joking me?"</font>

32:59.480 --> 33:01.359
<font color="cyan">I can see why</font>
<font color="cyan">they would say that, though,</font>

33:01.360 --> 33:04.319
<font color="cyan">they probably have looked at him</font>
<font color="cyan">and thought he has more experience,</font>

33:04.320 --> 33:06.519
<font color="cyan">probably fucking better suited,</font>
<font color="cyan">whatever.</font>

33:06.520 --> 33:09.839
<c.color008000>I don't date two people</font>
<c.color008000>at the same time on the outside.</font>

33:09.840 --> 33:11.879
<c.color008000>I'm not going to fucking flirt</font>
<c.color008000>with Paul,</font>

33:11.880 --> 33:14.559
<c.color008000>get into bed and kiss you.</font>
<c.color008000>That's just weird.</font>

33:14.560 --> 33:18.239
<c.color008000>And I'm not gonna come up to you</font>
<c.color008000>and be like, "Just so you know,</font>

33:18.240 --> 33:19.959
<c.color008000>I'm going to get to know Paul."</font>

33:19.960 --> 33:22.599
<c.color008000>If I said that to you, honestly,</font>
<c.color008000>I'd expect you to fuck me off.</font>

33:22.600 --> 33:24.559
<c.color008000>I wouldn't expect you</font>
<c.color008000>to deal with that.</font>

33:24.560 --> 33:27.719
<c.color008000>And likewise,</font>
<c.color008000>if you liked the girls,</font>

33:27.720 --> 33:30.799
<c.color008000>and you wanted to get to know them,</font>
<c.color008000>as far as I'm concerned, we're done.</font>

33:30.800 --> 33:33.719
<c.color008000>I'm not just gonna sit here and</font>
<c.color008000>wait. What do you think?</font>

33:33.720 --> 33:37.439
<font color="yellow">I think, like...</font>
<c.color008000>From your side, though.</font>

33:37.440 --> 33:39.159
<font color="yellow">My side?</font>
<c.color008000>Yeah.</font>

33:39.160 --> 33:42.839
<font color="yellow">Regarding what?</font>
<c.color008000>Like us or the new girls, like?</font>

33:42.840 --> 33:48.959
<font color="yellow">I think... The three weeks we've had</font>
<font color="yellow">has been eventful to say the least.</font>

33:48.960 --> 33:52.839
<font color="yellow">I don't think, you know,</font>
<font color="yellow">everyone can see that, you know,</font>

33:52.840 --> 33:57.359
<font color="yellow">we care about each other.</font>
<font color="yellow">And we are happy. And cool.</font>

33:57.360 --> 33:59.319
<font color="yellow">The girls are nice,</font>
<font color="yellow">do you know what I mean?</font>

33:59.320 --> 34:01.479
<font color="yellow">That's the first time</font>
<font color="yellow">I spoke to any of them.</font>

34:01.480 --> 34:03.799
<c.color008000>You're not, like, trying to do</font>
<c.color008000>anything with that?</font>

34:03.800 --> 34:08.039
<font color="yellow">No. I think they are attractive</font>
<font color="yellow">girls. They are nice girls.</font>

34:08.040 --> 34:12.239
<font color="yellow">I think you're a lovely girl as</font>
<font color="yellow">well.</font>

34:12.239 --> 34:14.639
<c.color008000>What does that mean?</font>

34:14.639 --> 34:18.279
<font color="yellow">It kind of just... is what it is.</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm not...</font>

34:18.280 --> 34:22.518
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying I'm jumping ship,</font>
<font color="yellow">do you know what I mean?</font>

34:22.520 --> 34:26.119
<font color="yellow">That's not what I'm saying.</font>
<font color="yellow">That's not what I'm saying.</font>

34:26.120 --> 34:27.918
<c.color008000>So what are you saying?</font>

34:27.920 --> 34:29.920
<font color="yellow">I'm saying what we've got,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm good with.</font>

34:32.159 --> 34:33.958
<font color="cyan">Had a little chat with Jack.</font>
<c.color008000>Yeah.</font>

34:33.960 --> 34:36.199
<font color="cyan">He seems really, really lovely.</font>
<c.color008000>Yeah.</font>

34:36.199 --> 34:39.279
<font color="cyan">He's probably, like, the most</font>
<font color="cyan">typically my type in here.</font>

34:39.280 --> 34:41.279
<c.color008000>Loud and a bit more</font>
<c.color008000>what do you call? Yeah.</font>

34:41.280 --> 34:43.159
<font color="cyan">I like mucking around</font>
<font color="cyan">and being silly.</font>

34:43.159 --> 34:45.199
<font color="cyan">I don't take myself seriously.</font>
<c.color008000>That's good.</font>

34:45.199 --> 34:47.599
<font color="cyan">And I like other people who</font>
<font color="cyan">bring that side out for me.</font>

34:47.600 --> 34:51.679
<font color="cyan">But obviously, I'm very</font>
<font color="cyan">conscious of Laura's feelings.</font>

34:51.679 --> 34:54.679
<font color="yellow">We're not in love and stuff,</font>
<font color="yellow">we are happy,</font>

34:54.679 --> 34:57.079
<font color="yellow">I am happy, like,</font>
<font color="yellow">I am happy with you.</font>

34:57.080 --> 34:59.959
<font color="yellow">There's nothing</font>
<font color="yellow">that's gone wrong here.</font>

34:59.960 --> 35:03.679
<font color="yellow">I'm not... I don't</font>
<font color="yellow">focus too much on the future,</font>

35:03.680 --> 35:05.999
<font color="yellow">I think that's so far away,</font>
<font color="yellow">don't even worry about it,</font>

35:06.000 --> 35:07.559
<font color="yellow">I want to think about here and now.</font>

35:07.560 --> 35:10.479
<font color="yellow">But there's no harm thinking</font>
<font color="yellow">what will happen when we leave.</font>

35:10.480 --> 35:12.839
<font color="cyan">What are you thinking about</font>
<font color="cyan">the outside?</font>

35:12.840 --> 35:16.559
<font color="yellow">I do worry, do you know what I mean?</font>
<font color="yellow">I do stress about it all.</font>

35:16.560 --> 35:19.719
<font color="cyan">What are you thinking?</font>

35:19.720 --> 35:21.759
<font color="yellow">Once we're out,</font>
<font color="yellow">how would me and you pan out?</font>

35:21.760 --> 35:24.519
<font color="cyan">What is it about me and you, or me,</font>

35:24.520 --> 35:27.079
<font color="cyan">that makes you think</font>
<font color="cyan">it wouldn't work on the outside?</font>

35:27.080 --> 35:30.159
<font color="yellow">People say about the age thing,</font>
<font color="yellow">I don't care about the age thing,</font>

35:30.160 --> 35:32.319
<font color="yellow">but we are in different</font>
<font color="yellow">parts of our lives.</font>

35:32.320 --> 35:36.679
<font color="yellow">I'm 22, you're 28, 29.</font>

35:36.680 --> 35:41.159
<font color="yellow">And you've had your career.</font>
<font color="yellow">You've got your career,</font>

35:41.160 --> 35:43.359
<font color="yellow">Partying and stuff</font>
<font color="yellow">and wanting to go out.</font>

35:43.360 --> 35:46.599
<font color="yellow">Do you still want to do that?</font>
<font color="cyan">Of course I do.</font>

35:46.600 --> 35:50.159
<font color="yellow">What's your five-year plan?</font>
<font color="yellow">Where are you going to live?</font>

35:50.160 --> 35:53.599
<font color="yellow">You haven't said. You don't know</font>
<font color="yellow">where you're living at the moment.</font>

35:53.600 --> 35:57.599
<font color="cyan">Yeah, originally I probably need to,</font>
<font color="cyan">yeah, go to Scotland.</font>

35:57.600 --> 36:00.599
<font color="yellow">A lot of my life</font>
<font color="yellow">is actually around London.</font>

36:00.600 --> 36:02.719
<font color="yellow">I don't really venture</font>
<font color="yellow">outside of it.</font>

36:02.720 --> 36:06.719
<font color="cyan">I'm just easy, like, just like,</font>
<font color="cyan">I can live anywhere.</font>

36:06.720 --> 36:09.879
<font color="cyan">If I'm in a relationship with</font>
<font color="cyan">someone, I'd live where they lived.</font>

36:09.880 --> 36:15.079
<font color="cyan">Like, obviously London would be,</font>
<font color="cyan">you know, easier</font>

36:15.080 --> 36:18.639
<font color="cyan">if it was to work out,</font>
<font color="cyan">do you know what I mean?</font>

36:18.640 --> 36:22.959
<font color="yellow">Yeah, that's what it is. If</font>
<font color="yellow">it was to work out. It's just hard.</font>

36:22.960 --> 36:26.159
<font color="cyan">Ugh. This is too much.</font>

36:26.160 --> 36:28.079
<font color="cyan">Like, I thought we were</font>
<font color="cyan">on the same page,</font>

36:28.080 --> 36:30.959
<font color="cyan">none of us like the new people,</font>
<font color="cyan">we're going to stick together.</font>

36:30.960 --> 36:33.079
<font color="cyan">And then we started talking about</font>
<font color="cyan">the future.</font>

36:33.080 --> 36:35.999
<font color="cyan">I just think if people want to be</font>
<font color="cyan">together, they will make it work.</font>

36:36.000 --> 36:39.919
<font color="cyan">If we both fancy each other and</font>
<font color="cyan">don't fancy anyone else, then, like,</font>

36:39.920 --> 36:42.319
<font color="cyan">why do we need to stop</font>
<font color="cyan">something that's good?</font>

36:42.320 --> 36:46.799
<font color="cyan">It's just driving me insane.</font>

36:46.800 --> 36:49.600
<font color="cyan">(SIGHS)</font>

37:04.280 --> 37:06.399
Is Jack going to hit the road?

37:06.400 --> 37:08.560
<font color="yellow">I just can't see it working.</font>

37:21.400 --> 37:24.799
As night falls, Sam and Georgia
are back on the graft,

37:24.800 --> 37:27.880
and Georgia has got something
to discuss with one of the new boys.

37:28.960 --> 37:33.920
"Do I call you New Josh, Josh 2.0,
Josh Squared, or how about Graham?"

37:40.880 --> 37:43.759
<font color="yellow">I have really enjoyed getting</font>
<font color="yellow">to know you today.</font>

37:43.760 --> 37:46.639
<font color="yellow">I feel like the conversation</font>
<font color="yellow">does really flow.</font>

37:46.640 --> 37:49.599
<font color="cyan">It's quite natural.</font>
<font color="yellow">It is very natural.</font>

37:49.600 --> 37:53.199
<font color="cyan">You surprised me so much.</font>
<font color="yellow">Really? </font><font color="cyan"> Yeah. </font><font color="yellow"> Did I? In what way?</font>

37:53.200 --> 37:56.119
<font color="cyan">You seem really grounded, like you</font>
<font color="cyan">know what you want.</font>

37:56.120 --> 37:59.639
<font color="cyan">That's what I'm looking for. I</font>
<font color="cyan">like a girl who knows what she wants</font>

37:59.640 --> 38:03.279
<font color="cyan">and she can take control</font>
<font color="cyan">sometimes. Do you know what I mean?</font>

38:03.280 --> 38:05.759
<font color="cyan">Yeah, you surprised me. Carry on</font>
<font color="cyan">surprising me</font>

38:05.760 --> 38:08.119
<font color="cyan">and it will be good.</font>
<font color="yellow">Aww, good.</font>

38:08.120 --> 38:11.279
<c.color008000>I would never have,</font>
<c.color008000>like, come in here and, like,</font>

38:11.280 --> 38:13.119
<c.color008000>tried to split you</font>
<c.color008000>and Georgia apart,</font>

38:13.120 --> 38:15.119
<c.color008000>but, like, it's nice that...</font>
<font color="cyan">Yeah. I mean -</font>

38:15.120 --> 38:19.119
<c.color008000>..given a chance.</font>
<font color="cyan">It was our choice to do that</font>

38:19.120 --> 38:20.919
<font color="cyan">and seek other options.</font>

38:20.920 --> 38:23.199
<font color="cyan">Obviously, like,</font>
<font color="cyan">with you coming in,</font>

38:23.200 --> 38:27.079
<font color="cyan">that's obviously something I want to</font>
<font color="cyan">do potentially, like, with you.</font>

38:27.080 --> 38:30.719
<c.color008000>I'm interested in getting to know</font>
<c.color008000>you. It's not just one-sided.</font>

38:30.720 --> 38:34.199
<font color="cyan">It's nice to hear. It's my decision</font>
<font color="cyan">to get to know other people.</font>

38:34.200 --> 38:36.559
<font color="cyan">Like, my mind has got to be getting</font>
<font color="cyan">to know someone else</font>

38:36.560 --> 38:40.639
<font color="cyan">and, like, focusing on myself and</font>
<font color="cyan">focusing on whoever I get to know.</font>

38:40.640 --> 38:43.039
<c.color008000>I'll carry on</font>
<c.color008000>getting to know the other boys.</font>

38:43.040 --> 38:45.479
<font color="cyan">Oh, yeah, of course.</font>
<c.color008000>Right now, for sure,</font>

38:45.480 --> 38:48.279
<c.color008000>I have the most</font>
<c.color008000>connection with you, definitely.</font>

38:48.280 --> 38:51.279
<font color="yellow">Me and Sam didn't decide to leave</font>
<font color="yellow">for a reason.</font>

38:51.280 --> 38:55.839
<font color="yellow">We felt, as a couple, we weren't</font>
<font color="yellow">ready to go on the outside world.</font>

38:55.840 --> 38:58.919
<font color="yellow">And everything does happen</font>
<font color="yellow">for a reason.</font>

38:58.920 --> 39:02.199
<font color="yellow">We're both attracted to each other.</font>
<font color="cyan">(CHUCKLES) It's the eyes.</font>

39:02.200 --> 39:04.079
<font color="yellow">Is it?</font>
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>

39:04.080 --> 39:05.879
<font color="yellow">Do you think?</font>
<font color="cyan">Yeah.</font>

39:05.880 --> 39:08.999
<font color="yellow">That's lovely.</font>

39:09.000 --> 39:14.879
<c.color008000>That's going to happen.</font>
<font color="yellow">That is 100 per cent guaranteed.</font>

39:14.880 --> 39:17.999
<font color="cyan">I can't stop looking at your eyes,</font>
<font color="cyan">man, I can't.</font>

39:18.000 --> 39:19.639
<font color="yellow">Really? </font><font color="cyan"> Yeah.</font>

39:19.640 --> 39:21.919
<font color="cyan">OK. Whoo! Tunnel vision.</font>

39:21.920 --> 39:25.720
<font color="yellow">You're funny. You crack me up.</font>

39:27.640 --> 39:31.399
While Georgia proves her love
for Sam by cracking on to new Josh,

39:31.400 --> 39:34.959
Sam is working out whether he should
prove his love to Georgia

39:34.960 --> 39:37.839
by cracking on to new Laura
or Stephanie.

39:37.840 --> 39:39.839
<font color="cyan">Obviously, I've made this decision.</font>

39:39.840 --> 39:44.079
<font color="cyan">And I feel like my connection is</font>
<font color="cyan">slightly stronger with Laura,</font>

39:44.080 --> 39:46.479
<font color="cyan">but I haven't really</font>
<font color="cyan">had a chat with Steph yet.</font>

39:46.480 --> 39:50.359
<c.color008000>Steph's nice. I've chatted to her.</font>
<font color="cyan">Yeah, she's really fit.</font>

39:50.360 --> 39:53.799
<c.color008000>She's really, like, quite open</font>
<c.color008000>and chilled and quite nice.</font>

39:53.800 --> 39:56.679
<c.color008000>Just get to know them both.</font>
<font color="cyan">Steph is more my type,</font>

39:56.680 --> 40:00.159
<font color="cyan">but Laura's more my personality,</font>
<font color="cyan">the way she gets stuck in.</font>

40:00.160 --> 40:02.479
<c.color008000>I'm surprised.</font>
<font color="cyan">Really easy-going and stuff.</font>

40:02.480 --> 40:06.559
<c.color008000>She's quite like a surfer dude,</font>
<c.color008000>kind of surfer chick, like.</font>

40:06.560 --> 40:08.399
<font color="cyan">What do you mean?</font>
(LAUGHTER)

40:08.400 --> 40:11.959
<font color="cyan">I'm sorry, am I... Do you want me</font>
<font color="cyan">to...? You want...?</font>

40:11.960 --> 40:13.879
<c.color008000>She's like surfer...</font>
<c.color008000>I'm just surprised.</font>

40:13.880 --> 40:17.199
<c.color008000>I thought...</font>
<font color="cyan">You thought you could have her?</font>

40:17.200 --> 40:21.839
<c.color008000>Oh, mate, don't be stupid.</font>
<c.color008000>I'm not saying that.</font>

40:21.840 --> 40:23.919
<c.color008000>But I'm just surprised,</font>
<c.color008000>because I thought...</font>

40:23.920 --> 40:25.799
<font color="cyan">Just say it. "I wanted..."</font>
<font color="cyan">I'm joking.</font>

40:25.800 --> 40:30.079
<font color="cyan">What are you saying about Alexandra</font>
<font color="cyan">at the moment?</font>

40:30.080 --> 40:32.599
<c.color008000>I think I've just got to...</font>
<c.color008000>I don't know.</font>

40:32.600 --> 40:34.959
<c.color008000>We're doing well.</font>
<c.color008000>We're doing well day by day.</font>

40:34.960 --> 40:37.319
<c.color008000>We're growing as a pair.</font>

40:37.320 --> 40:39.759
<c.color008000>But, like, it's just so early,</font>
<c.color008000>and I just feel...</font>

40:39.760 --> 40:42.279
<c.color008000>Also, she does want to move things</font>
<c.color008000>quite quickly.</font>

40:42.280 --> 40:45.319
<font color="yellow">Are you having second thoughts?</font>
<c.color008000>Well, I...</font>

40:45.320 --> 40:47.039
<font color="cyan">I don't think you like her enough.</font>

40:47.040 --> 40:50.359
<c.color008000>I think I just... Hmm. I don't know.</font>
<c.color008000>I am humming and hawing.</font>

40:50.360 --> 40:52.959
<c.color008000>I don't know if I have</font>
<c.color008000>strong enough feelings as she does.</font>

40:52.960 --> 40:56.599
<c.color008000>But I don't know... At the moment</font>
<c.color008000>I'm having doubts, yeah.</font>

40:56.600 --> 40:58.919
<c.color008000>I definitely need to speak</font>
<c.color008000>to Alexandra.</font>

40:58.920 --> 41:01.959
<c.color008000>I want to be open. I always said I</font>
<c.color008000>wanted to be open and honest here.</font>

41:01.960 --> 41:04.639
<c.color008000>I don't want her getting</font>
<c.color008000>the wrong messages</font>

41:04.640 --> 41:08.719
<c.color008000>or thinking we are completely</font>
<c.color008000>exclusive or anything like that.</font>

41:08.720 --> 41:11.279
<c.color008000>I also don't want her to think</font>
<c.color008000>I'm not at all interested.</font>

41:11.280 --> 41:15.199
<c.color008000>I just think we need to make sure</font>
<c.color008000>we are on the same page</font>

41:15.200 --> 41:17.559
<c.color008000>and clear things up a little bit.</font>

41:17.560 --> 41:21.199
<font color="yellow">I feel like since the new people</font>
<font color="yellow">have come into the villa...</font>

41:21.200 --> 41:23.199
<font color="cyan">Yeah?</font>

41:23.200 --> 41:25.919
<font color="yellow">I feel like Alex has just been</font>
<font color="yellow">quite distant.</font>

41:25.920 --> 41:30.799
<font color="yellow">I just feel like that connection</font>
<font color="yellow">has maybe fizzled out a bit.</font>

41:30.800 --> 41:32.479
<font color="cyan">You think he's gone off you?</font>

41:32.480 --> 41:36.479
<font color="yellow">I am used to someone being quite</font>
<font color="yellow">affectionate, not to smother me,</font>

41:36.480 --> 41:41.079
<font color="yellow">but I feel like I need</font>
<font color="yellow">that connection,</font>

41:41.080 --> 41:43.839
<font color="yellow">to know that someone wants you.</font>

41:43.840 --> 41:47.199
<font color="cyan">It makes you feel shit.</font>
<font color="yellow">I don't feel like I've got that,</font>

41:47.200 --> 41:49.119
<font color="yellow">and that's making it really hard</font>
<font color="yellow">for me.</font>

41:49.120 --> 41:50.959
<font color="cyan">Have you said anything to him?</font>

41:50.960 --> 41:52.639
<font color="yellow">Not yet.</font>

41:52.640 --> 41:55.799
<font color="yellow">Because I've tried to, like,</font>
<font color="yellow">hold out and see -</font>

41:55.800 --> 41:58.679
<font color="cyan">Yeah, you've tried to let it go.</font>
<font color="yellow">..see if anything will change.</font>

41:58.680 --> 42:01.999
<font color="cyan">Yeah, yeah, yeah.</font>
<font color="cyan">Boys have off-days, as girls do.</font>

42:02.000 --> 42:04.199
<font color="cyan">We live together. We can't be</font>
<font color="cyan">on it all the time.</font>

42:04.200 --> 42:06.879
<font color="cyan">Alex is a gentleman. He has treated</font>
<font color="cyan">her like a princess so far.</font>

42:06.880 --> 42:09.159
<font color="cyan">I do think Alexandra is worried</font>
<font color="cyan">about nothing,</font>

42:09.160 --> 42:11.159
<font color="cyan">because why wouldn't she trust Alex?</font>

42:11.160 --> 42:13.279
<font color="cyan">He is like the most trustworthy</font>
<font color="cyan">person ever.</font>

42:13.280 --> 42:16.399
Alexandra wants to talk to Alex
on the hot tub steps.

42:16.400 --> 42:19.479
Ugh! (POSH) New Laura wouldn't want
to talk on the hot tub steps,

42:19.480 --> 42:21.519
she'd want to talk
on the sun lounger,

42:21.520 --> 42:24.039
because she's, like, way cool.

42:24.040 --> 42:27.759
<font color="yellow">Today I feel just like I've had</font>
<font color="yellow">a bad vibe from you.</font>

42:27.760 --> 42:30.719
<font color="yellow">Um... Like, as soon as new people</font>
<font color="yellow">walked in,</font>

42:30.720 --> 42:32.519
<font color="yellow">I felt you were really distant.</font>

42:32.520 --> 42:35.519
<font color="yellow">And I thought things were going</font>
<font color="yellow">quite well between us.</font>

42:35.520 --> 42:40.079
<font color="yellow">Two gorgeous new guys have come in.</font>
<font color="yellow">I don't want to look at them.</font>

42:40.080 --> 42:41.879
<font color="yellow">My head was not turned.</font>

42:41.880 --> 42:43.959
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to focus on you.</font>

42:43.960 --> 42:47.839
<font color="yellow">And, yeah, I mean,</font>
<font color="yellow">I felt hurt today.</font>

42:47.840 --> 42:53.479
<font color="yellow">Because... I've been made</font>
<font color="yellow">to feel like, you know,</font>

42:53.480 --> 42:58.439
<font color="yellow">there are other options for you.</font>
<font color="yellow">You've been distant.</font>

42:58.440 --> 43:00.839
<font color="yellow">So...</font>

43:00.840 --> 43:03.719
<font color="cyan">I've not been distant</font>
<font color="cyan">because the new girls have come in.</font>

43:03.720 --> 43:07.879
<font color="cyan">I just feel that, in general,</font>
<font color="cyan">I just don't want to move at a pace</font>

43:07.880 --> 43:09.919
<font color="cyan">that is too quick</font>
<font color="cyan">and I feel more pressure.</font>

43:09.920 --> 43:12.159
<font color="cyan">Yeah, you know, someone</font>
<font color="cyan">coming in like Laura,</font>

43:12.160 --> 43:14.759
<font color="cyan">who, yeah, probably is</font>
<font color="cyan">quite my type,</font>

43:14.760 --> 43:16.999
<font color="cyan">made me realise I don't want</font>
<font color="cyan">to rush into a decision.</font>

43:17.000 --> 43:21.039
<font color="cyan">It's not me saying I want to step</font>
<font color="cyan">back away from us at all,</font>

43:21.040 --> 43:23.279
<font color="cyan">but I do have to be honest</font>
<font color="cyan">with my feelings.</font>

43:23.280 --> 43:25.879
<font color="cyan">I don't want to play games with you.</font>
<font color="yellow">I appreciate that.</font>

43:25.880 --> 43:28.159
<font color="cyan">I don't think we're at the point</font>
<font color="cyan">of Jack and Dani.</font>

43:28.160 --> 43:31.839
<font color="cyan">I'm really sorry that I have made</font>
<font color="cyan">you feel like that today.</font>

43:31.840 --> 43:36.559
<font color="cyan">I feel awful if I have. I'd never</font>
<font color="cyan">want to upset you by being distant.</font>

43:36.560 --> 43:40.479
<font color="cyan">But I know, for you, that must feel</font>
<font color="cyan">like, "Oh, he's not bothered today."</font>

43:40.480 --> 43:42.839
<font color="cyan">But it's not true.</font>
<font color="yellow">It's not that you're not bothered.</font>

43:42.840 --> 43:47.679
<font color="yellow">I'm just getting a vibe</font>
<font color="yellow">that there's something going on.</font>

43:47.680 --> 43:50.199
<font color="cyan">I just think we need to slow things</font>
<font color="cyan">down a little bit.</font>

43:50.200 --> 43:52.719
<font color="cyan">I want to be sure we have</font>
<font color="cyan">got the right connection.</font>

43:52.720 --> 43:55.399
<font color="cyan">I think that's the right thing to do</font>
<font color="cyan">at the moment.</font>

43:55.400 --> 43:58.439
<font color="cyan">I'm sorry if that's...</font>
<font color="yellow">No, it's OK.</font>

43:58.440 --> 43:59.999
<font color="cyan">I just feel that that's...</font>

44:00.000 --> 44:03.439
<font color="yellow">I appreciate us being completely</font>
<font color="yellow">honest with each other.</font>

44:03.440 --> 44:07.959
<font color="yellow">I just wanted to let you know</font>
<font color="yellow">that I do like you, and that's it.</font>

44:07.960 --> 44:10.839
<font color="cyan">And I do like you as well, and</font>
<font color="cyan">that's why we've coupled together.</font>

44:10.840 --> 44:13.799
<font color="cyan">But I just think at the moment</font>
<font color="cyan">I just need to - </font><font color="yellow"> That's fine.</font>

44:13.800 --> 44:16.599
<font color="cyan">..take things a bit slower and,</font>
<font color="cyan">like, see how things go.</font>

44:16.600 --> 44:18.759
<font color="yellow">That's OK. It's OK.</font>
<font color="cyan">All right?</font>

44:18.760 --> 44:20.880
<font color="yellow">Yeah. It's all good.</font>
<font color="cyan">OK. Come on.</font>

44:24.160 --> 44:26.559
<font color="yellow">As a female, you just know.</font>

44:26.560 --> 44:29.799
<font color="yellow">Like, there's this voice inside you</font>
<font color="yellow">that's just screaming at you,</font>

44:29.800 --> 44:33.079
<font color="yellow">"Something's not right."</font>

44:33.080 --> 44:38.079
<font color="yellow">I am just upset that the person</font>
<font color="yellow">that I decided to go with</font>

44:38.080 --> 44:44.359
<font color="yellow">now probably wants to be</font>
<font color="yellow">with somebody else.</font>

44:44.360 --> 44:47.999
Laura was let down by Wes, and Jack
is about to do the same thing.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.759
It is a terrible shame,
but thankfully Laura is Scottish

44:50.760 --> 44:54.280
so enduring endless disappointment
is built into her DNA.

44:55.800 --> 44:59.159
<font color="cyan">The time is now to tell her.</font>

44:59.160 --> 45:03.079
<font color="cyan">It's obviously not easy, man.</font>

45:03.080 --> 45:07.079
<font color="cyan">Today and the last couple of days,</font>
<font color="cyan">I have come to the realisation</font>

45:07.080 --> 45:09.839
<font color="cyan">that, as much</font>
<font color="cyan">as I do care about Laura,</font>

45:09.840 --> 45:14.599
<font color="cyan">I know, when I'm with a girl,</font>
<font color="cyan">I'm really, really happy.</font>

45:14.600 --> 45:17.439
<font color="cyan">Like, I know in myself</font>
<font color="cyan">that I'm happy.</font>

45:17.440 --> 45:21.679
<font color="cyan">At the moment, even though I am,</font>
<font color="cyan">I know I can be even more.</font>

45:21.680 --> 45:26.039
<font color="cyan">So I do think that things</font>
<font color="cyan">need to be addressed.</font>

45:26.040 --> 45:30.599
<font color="cyan">It's a difficult situation.</font>
<font color="cyan">No one has done anything wrong.</font>

45:30.600 --> 45:34.719
<font color="cyan">Laura hasn't done anything wrong.</font>
<font color="cyan">I haven't. It is just how I feel.</font>

45:34.720 --> 45:36.559
<font color="cyan">It would be so much easier</font>

45:36.560 --> 45:39.479
<font color="cyan">if I did not think that Laura</font>
<font color="cyan">was such a nice girl.</font>

45:39.480 --> 45:42.679
<font color="yellow">Of course. It is tough, man.</font>

45:42.680 --> 45:47.039
<font color="yellow">You have got this. It is going to be</font>
<font color="yellow">a tough conversation,</font>

45:47.040 --> 45:49.399
<font color="yellow">but it is a conversation</font>
<font color="yellow">that needs to happen.</font>

45:49.400 --> 45:51.439
<font color="cyan">Oh, this is going to be mad.</font>

45:51.440 --> 45:54.639
<font color="yellow">Head in the game, yeah? Magic.</font>

45:54.640 --> 45:57.160
<font color="yellow">I've got your back,</font>
<font color="yellow">don't worry about it.</font>

45:58.520 --> 46:01.759
<font color="cyan">This discussion with Laura</font>
<font color="cyan">is going to be very, very hard.</font>

46:01.760 --> 46:05.999
<font color="cyan">Like, nothing has happened for this</font>
<font color="cyan">to happen. It just is what it is.</font>

46:06.000 --> 46:09.919
<font color="cyan">In some ways, it's even harder,</font>
<font color="cyan">because what I'm going to say to her</font>

46:09.920 --> 46:11.559
<font color="cyan">is going to hurt her.</font>

46:11.560 --> 46:14.919
<font color="cyan">Ultimately, I hope she sees that</font>

46:14.920 --> 46:19.359
<font color="cyan">it will work out in the end,</font>
<font color="cyan">even though we won't be together.</font>

46:19.360 --> 46:22.119
<font color="yellow">Hi!</font>
<font color="cyan">Let's chat.</font>

46:22.120 --> 46:24.399
<font color="yellow">You want to speak to me?</font>
<font color="cyan">I do.</font>

46:24.400 --> 46:26.280
<font color="yellow">OK.</font>

46:28.520 --> 46:30.719
<font color="cyan">It's been a crazy day, hasn't it?</font>

46:30.720 --> 46:33.399
<c.color008000>Jack is about to tell Laura...</font>

46:33.400 --> 46:35.280
<font color="cyan">The same thing that I did?</font>

46:37.160 --> 46:42.320
<font color="yellow">I feel like you are going to say</font>
<font color="yellow">something bad. (LAUGHS)</font>

46:47.240 --> 46:49.240
<c.color008000>That is why I broke up with her.</font>

<font color="cyan">(SIGHS)</font>
<font color="yellow">Great, what?</font>

46:54.640 --> 46:58.079
<font color="cyan">I just think...</font>

46:58.080 --> 47:03.919
<font color="cyan">I think I want to be honest</font>
<font color="cyan">with how I am feeling.</font>

47:03.920 --> 47:11.359
<font color="cyan">And, I just feel as if,</font>
<font color="cyan">and it is frustrating because,</font>

47:11.360 --> 47:16.279
<font color="cyan">it is how I feel, I cannot control</font>
<font color="cyan">how I feel, you know what I mean?</font>

47:16.280 --> 47:18.639
<font color="cyan">As much as I want it to work,</font>

47:18.640 --> 47:25.599
<font color="cyan">and I want to think</font>
<font color="cyan">about the future and stuff,</font>

47:25.600 --> 47:29.639
<font color="cyan">outside the villa,</font>
<font color="cyan">I cannot see it working.</font>

47:29.640 --> 47:32.600
# I can't make you love me...

47:34.800 --> 47:36.520
<font color="yellow">I don't know what to say.</font>

47:38.840 --> 47:45.000
# You can't make your heart feel
something it won't...

47:49.000 --> 47:51.279
<font color="cyan">I do really like you.</font>

47:51.280 --> 47:54.399
<font color="cyan">I have had a crazy journey</font>
<font color="cyan">in here with you.</font>

47:54.400 --> 47:57.759
<font color="cyan">Sometimes really shit,</font>
<font color="cyan">and sometimes really good.</font>

47:57.760 --> 48:00.559
<font color="yellow">I just don't like to give up.</font>

48:00.560 --> 48:04.119
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying you are giving up,</font>
<font color="yellow">I'm not saying that, it is just...</font>

48:04.120 --> 48:10.039
<font color="yellow">I sometimes feel,</font>
<font color="yellow">I mean, I don't know.</font>

48:10.040 --> 48:12.679
<font color="yellow">Maybe we are not right</font>
<font color="yellow">for each other.</font>

48:12.680 --> 48:14.519
<font color="yellow">It is fine.</font>

48:14.520 --> 48:17.719
<font color="cyan">As much as I want that</font>
<font color="cyan">to be the case,</font>

48:17.720 --> 48:20.599
<font color="cyan">I'm sorry about the way</font>
<font color="cyan">it has panned out.</font>

48:20.600 --> 48:22.639
<font color="cyan">You know, I am sorry.</font>

48:22.640 --> 48:25.199
<font color="yellow">You just have to follow your heart.</font>

48:25.200 --> 48:28.120
<font color="yellow">I would not stop you</font>
<font color="yellow">from doing that.</font>

48:33.760 --> 48:35.679
<font color="cyan">I am sorry.</font>

48:35.680 --> 48:38.479
<font color="cyan">Give me a cuddle, at least.</font>

48:38.480 --> 48:42.679
# Cos I can't make you love me...

48:42.680 --> 48:46.199
<font color="yellow">Do we have to?</font>

48:46.200 --> 48:49.239
<font color="yellow">This is weird, sorry.</font>

48:49.240 --> 48:53.639
<font color="cyan">It's OK. You don't have to.</font>

<font color="yellow">Are you going to sleep in the bed,</font>

49:15.000 --> 49:16.679
<font color="cyan">It is completely up to you.</font>
