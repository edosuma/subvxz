Mornings in New York.

Got to tell you.

It's another gorgeous day.

00:52.095 --> 00:54.174
Oh, I never get sick of

Mother Nature.

00:55.392 --> 00:57.662
It's just so lush here.

00:57.664 --> 00:58.782
I never understand why people

00:58.784 --> 00:59.709
say it's so hard to live in

Let's go over.

Hello, sir.

It's a pleasure to meet your

01:07.264 --> 01:07.774
I'm Kate.

01:10.847 --> 01:11.454
Okay?

01:11.455 --> 01:12.605
We've got some things for

01:12.607 --> 01:13.118
you.

01:13.119 --> 01:14.429
Yeah, buy one more and get a

01:14.431 --> 01:15.614
medium frozen yogurt on me.

01:15.616 --> 01:16.926
And this is a 12-hour energy

Oh, well, thank you!

01:27.039 --> 01:28.542
inside yourself and call

01:28.544 --> 01:30.014
yourself a fuck party, 'cause

That's a tricky combo.

And one I respect.

01:44.864 --> 01:45.853
Absolutely.

01:45.855 --> 01:46.686
Nice guy, too.

01:46.688 --> 01:47.550
Oh, lovely.

01:47.552 --> 01:48.894
Bitches!

01:48.895 --> 01:49.758
I don't want to waste

01:49.760 --> 01:50.557
anyone's time today.

01:50.559 --> 01:51.901
There are a lot of people who

01:51.903 --> 01:53.342
work in my industry who are

01:53.343 --> 01:54.685
gonna make you promises that

01:54.687 --> 01:55.774
they really can't keep.

01:55.776 --> 01:57.213
But I feel I should tell you

01:57.215 --> 01:58.462
that I've got a lot of other

01:58.464 --> 01:59.774
couples who are banging down my

01:59.776 --> 02:01.342
door, trying to do business with

02:01.344 --> 02:02.365
these ovaries.

02:02.367 --> 02:04.414
In fact, my eggs are some of the

02:04.416 --> 02:06.269
finest that you will find in

02:06.271 --> 02:07.134
Manhattan.

02:07.135 --> 02:09.054
And right now... today... they

02:09.055 --> 02:10.782
are ripe for the picking.

02:10.783 --> 02:12.094
Ma'am, you cannot conduct

02:12.096 --> 02:13.693
your meetings here any longer.

You can't sit here all day

This is my good friend,

02:18.560 --> 02:19.741
I didn't hear a "no" from you

Oh, my God, when we tell Laurel

[ Sighs ] Thanks, but no spanks.
We're not going.

that's the end of the discussion.

Pssh! >> I haven't
thought about that in ages.

05:13.567 --> 05:18.429
Little Kate, when you grow up, do you want
to be a mommy who enters the workforce or a

05:18.431 --> 05:26.104
mommy who stays home? >> Um... Well,
can you maybe repeat the question?

05:31.679 --> 05:38.685
When you're a mommy, do you want to enter
the workforce, or do you want to stay home?

05:38.687 --> 05:46.360
Workplaces are where people work.
>> Are you a moron, kid?

Okay, who has the time with our
careers blowing up the way they are?

07:28.095 --> 07:35.768
And so, yes, up until then, my entire life
had been about winning... winning the crown,

07:38.495 --> 07:46.168
winning the modeling contract, winning the husband.
But what I would soon learn is

07:46.879 --> 07:53.085

greatest win of all. >> Wow.

Yes, of course. I want you to know that
both of you have been in my prayers all

last couldn't have been easy.

09:01.663 --> 09:07.261

So, I'd say we're doing pretty

brightest bulb in the light shop.

>> You know, I don't have a

medical degree, per se... >>
she's an egg donor. >> Yeah.

10:07.231 --> 10:10.845
But she's got big dreams of managing other
girls' eggs when she inevitably ages out of the

10:10.846 --> 10:14.717

but it's gonna be exciting.

10:14.719 --> 10:18.876
I love the way the two of you aren't
embarrassed about where you are in life.

you two need any help from

certainly qualify. So...

Bye, Cheryl. Bye, faith.
>> Thank you.

I don't think Laurel got the full picture
of where we are. >> How could she have?

10:42.303 --> 10:48.284
She only got a snapshot. >> I mean, I
don't want to go back to the pageant.

10:48.286 --> 10:52.253
No, thanks, right? >> The only reason I
could even think of to go is to just get

10:52.255 --> 10:55.837
some much-needed vacation time for you and me.
>> Yeah, we barely get to see

10:55.839 --> 10:58.781
each other. >> I mean, look.
We don't need to go back for

10:58.783 --> 11:02.076
ourselves. That's clear. >> I
mean, we could go back for

of raise the bar, so to speak?

I mean, not that it matters.

13:44.030 --> 13:47.741
in the midst of all this craziness of today
that I've forgotten it's a really hard

13:47.743 --> 13:51.165
anniversary for you. >>
It's a tough day. >> Yeah!

13:51.167 --> 13:54.845
I mean, how long has it been since you
and Stephen broke up? It's about 9...

13:54.847 --> 14:00.092
>> 91/2 years. Very fresh.
>> Like yesterday.

14:00.094 --> 14:03.101
Yeah. >> Oh. [ Exhales deeply ]

14:03.103 --> 14:07.421
Okay, that's doing something. >> Good.
Good! It might be too soon for me to

14:07.422 --> 14:12.060
make a call, but I got a pretty good
feeling he's circling back any day now.

14:12.062 --> 14:15.421
>> Yeah? >> Yes! >>
He is, isn't he?

14:15.423 --> 14:17.916
>> Yeah! >> He is. He's coming back.
He's coming back!

14:17.918 --> 14:22.301
>> Yes, he is! He's coming back! >> I know he is.
>> Per Richard, we have got a

14:22.303 --> 14:25.949
very long drive ahead of us to Neptune.
So, that means no stops that

14:25.951 --> 14:29.149
aren't absolutely necessary, okay?
>> We stop to eat and pee.

14:29.150 --> 14:31.741
>> Right. >> And I say
we don't even do that.

14:31.743 --> 14:38.653
No matter what, the end. >> Perfect.
>> I like candy when I can get

14:38.655 --> 14:41.757
it. There's an exit!
There's an exit!

14:41.759 --> 14:47.805
Get off! [ Tires screech ]
>> Chloe, we need this.

14:47.807 --> 14:53.181
This place is a gold mine. >> Oh, my God,
Kate, that girl looks just like you.

14:53.183 --> 14:57.725
She looks like she could be your daughter.
>> Oh, my God, Chloe.

14:57.727 --> 15:02.109
That is hilarious. She's like my mini-me.
>> She could be your egg baby.

15:02.111 --> 15:07.548
Ever wonder how many you have
running around out there? >> Mama.

15:07.550 --> 15:13.660
>> Huh. This. And that one. Good.
>> I'm sorry, but do you have

15:13.662 --> 15:17.053
another card? >> What? >>
It's probably just the strip.

15:17.054 --> 15:19.164
You know what? Actually... >> I got one.
I got another one.

15:19.166 --> 15:25.661
>> Why don't you try 9723?
>> Yeah. [ Beeping ]

15:25.663 --> 15:29.533
>> No dice. >> What? That's craziness.
>> I am shocked right now.

15:29.534 --> 15:32.317
You know what? Let's not mess around.
Bring out the big guns... 8765.

15:32.319 --> 15:34.268
>> No more fooling.
>> Yeah. >> No.

15:34.270 --> 15:37.629
>> Do you want to try 6439?
>> No. No, she's no good.

15:37.631 --> 15:41.533
That shabby chic sale at target
totally did her up. >> 6253?

15:41.535 --> 15:45.757
>> Are you on crack? Okay, she bottomed out
when we morphed our faces with celebs'

15:45.759 --> 15:48.637
to see what our babies
would look like. 8765?

15:48.639 --> 15:51.741
>> No. We drained her on the Nigerian
prince who e-mailed us about all

15:51.743 --> 15:54.653
that trouble he had getting home. >> Kate...
That's the last of our

15:54.655 --> 16:00.157
girls. >> All right. I am
going to call credit-card

16:00.159 --> 16:04.028
companies. Lady Einstein's
got to figure this one out.

16:04.030 --> 16:06.973
Shit. Chloe? It went buh-nuh-nuh-nuh.
>> I can't believe you went

16:06.974 --> 16:09.405
buh-nuh-nuh-nuh at a time like this.
>> Give me your phone.

16:09.407 --> 16:12.733
>> My phone's out of juice 'cause I left the
charger behind in order to make more room

16:12.734 --> 16:18.653
for... >> your scrapbooks, right.
>> Um... Do you have cash?

16:18.655 --> 16:26.327
>> Cash. >> Now, how would that work?
All right, okay.

16:26.495 --> 16:34.167
We just need to figure out a way
to, like, live. >> [ Gasps ]

16:34.591 --> 16:42.263
Look! A little, old bunny.
Can we keep him?!

16:42.655 --> 16:45.820
Please! >> Chloe, we're not
keeping a wild animal.

16:45.822 --> 16:51.453
That's insane. >> So, we just leave...
Andrew out here to die, in this foreign

16:51.455 --> 16:54.141
wilderness? >> We do not
need a pet right now.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.316
We need cash. >> I'll
take amazing care of him.

16:56.318 --> 16:59.837
>> Chloe... [ Sighs ] ...You
honestly think that being

16:59.839 --> 17:07.229
responsible for another life is what we need right now?
Actually, being responsible for

17:07.231 --> 17:12.252
another life could be exactly what we need right now.
>> Yay! We're parents!

17:12.253 --> 17:19.926
[ Cellphone ringing ] >> Ahoy!
>> Hi, dad.

17:23.231 --> 17:26.684
>> Hey, Bruce. >> What can I
do for you girls? >> Listen.

17:26.685 --> 17:30.876
Kate and I are in a little bit of a pickle, and
we could use some help... specifically, some

17:30.878 --> 17:35.292
sweet cash money. [ Receiver
clicking ] oh, shit balls!

17:35.294 --> 17:41.436
>> Bruce? >> I bet he's out on the yacht.
He gets, like, no service.

17:41.438 --> 17:46.333
>> [ Sighs ] Chloe... Isn't
his house on the way to

17:46.335 --> 17:48.957
Neptune? >> Yeah, it is.
>> Let's surprise him.

17:48.959 --> 17:53.437
>> He just moved to this new, fatty condo in
this, like, super-exclusive gated community.

17:53.438 --> 17:56.796
>> We stay the night in the lap of luxury,
which we deserve after all this driving.

17:56.798 --> 17:59.676
>> He gives us money, which he loves to do.
>> We're back on the road in the

17:59.678 --> 18:03.164
morning. >> Refreshed,
refueled, refinanced!

18:03.166 --> 18:07.453
Careful. >> You want me to?
No, okay. Here.

18:07.455 --> 18:11.708
Yeah, but... It's really tight with
the whole family in here together.

18:11.710 --> 18:14.556
>> No, one more time. >> Try this way.
>> I'm really starting to

18:14.558 --> 18:18.588
understand why people don't use these anymore.
>> It just doesn't make sense.

18:18.590 --> 18:22.364
>> ? All these people talkin' 'bout you
now ? ? they don't make no difference,

18:22.366 --> 18:29.084
no ? >> thank you. >>
Both: One, two, three.

18:29.086 --> 18:35.004
Mmm... [ Both mumbling ]
>> one, two, three...

18:35.006 --> 18:39.804
>> Both: Juice. Juice?
I said, "Jews."

18:39.806 --> 18:44.477
One, two, three... >> Both: Basketball.
>> Wow. That was weird.

18:44.479 --> 18:48.733
We are, like, so on the same
page sometimes. >> Damn it!

18:48.735 --> 18:51.293
>> ? All night long, believe
me ? ? let that beat

18:51.294 --> 18:54.173

me ? there's no one watching

18:54.174 --> 18:57.821
? come on
? we can rock this party

18:57.823 --> 19:05.495
>> 'mones. My hormones. >> Wow!

19:16.510 --> 19:22.333
I guess I never knew you gave them to yourself like that.
>> Oh, yeah, every 12 hours.

These eggs don't cook themselves.

19:38.078 --> 19:43.068
>> Uh... >> Changing destination.
>> Yes, totally.

19:43.070 --> 19:47.741
Just, um, appears that we may have driven a
hop, skip, and a jump in the wrong direction.

19:47.743 --> 19:51.485
For some reason, Richard is thinking
we're going to Neptune, Canada.

19:51.487 --> 19:57.724
>> Why would Richard think that? >> I don't know
if these tips plugged in the wrong address by

19:57.726 --> 20:00.092
accident. [ Groans
] better not have.

20:00.094 --> 20:03.228
>> Well, how long have we been
driving in the wrong direction for?

20:03.230 --> 20:10.902
>> Well, just like... Just like
all of today. >> [ Groans ]

20:11.102 --> 20:14.525

20:14.527 --> 20:18.684
Einstein couldn't cook a can of soup,
and you are exactly the same way.

>> Thank you, Chloe. >> Okay. Yes.
>> We are making tracks

20:22.655 --> 20:25.949

is your dad's new condo?

>> Okay.

Good night, moneybags. >>
Good night, Bruce. >> Oh.

What? Whoop! Good night, stinker.
>> Good night, dad.

>> Love you, dad.

need a hand with that?

>> Dad?

21:36.254 --> 21:43.926
Whew! >> I mean, I don't understand.
He was always offering us money

21:47.295 --> 21:49.821
in those rare cases of emergency.
>> Like when we needed your

21:49.823 --> 21:52.764
business cards printed. >> When we needed
those publicity stills taken of you.

21:52.766 --> 21:59.676
>> Obviously, the water bed. This doesn't feel great.
These are a lot of... Feelings.

21:59.678 --> 22:03.516
>> Yep. I don't like this.
I don't like this one bit.

22:03.518 --> 22:08.157
Okay. Let's play a fun game. Let's
pretend that we never came here.

22:08.158 --> 22:13.148
No, come on. We're just at home, and
we're watching some of our favorite

22:13.150 --> 22:17.852
programs. >> Let him you know that
you love him and that you support

22:17.854 --> 22:21.372
him, okay? >> I'm not going to rehab!
>> Brian, you got two choices-

22:21.374 --> 22:25.212
recovery or death, and I promise
you, it's gonna be one or the other.

22:25.214 --> 22:30.876
>> Brian had such a sparkle when he was younger.
Can you believe it got so bad?

22:30.878 --> 22:36.540
>> Actually, Chloe, I can. He was addicted to meth and sex.
It's a very tricky combination

22:36.542 --> 22:39.548
for someone. >> Another Ambien?
>> Yes, thank you.

to do s say yes, and we're extending

I go, I want to smoke this 20 bag I have.

He's going! >> Oh, thank God.

>> I don't think that's plugged

23:22.718 --> 23:27.389
into anything. >> Wish I could spend more
time with you gals, but it's the busy

23:27.391 --> 23:31.388
part of my season. I'm selling
gold nuggets on ebay.

23:31.390 --> 23:37.404
I can't believe nobody's ever thought of it.
I misspell the word "nugget" on

23:37.406 --> 23:42.044
the website. >> I'm sorry. Come again.
>> I leave the "g" out of the

23:42.046 --> 23:45.820
word "nugget." This way, I get all the
traffic from the people that don't know

23:45.822 --> 23:49.500
how to spell. I figured, I didn't know
how to spell it, so you bet your ass

23:49.502 --> 23:52.636
there's a lot of people that don't
know how to spell it, either.

23:52.638 --> 23:58.236
I mean, it's a surefire way to make money.
I mean, I have to...

23:58.238 --> 24:03.420
I had to sell the mall kiosk,
unfortunately. >> Oh, no.

24:03.422 --> 24:08.956
>> It turns out people, they don't want to
buy hats that are made specifically to wear

24:08.958 --> 24:13.788
backwards. They'd rather just buy a
regular hat, you know, turn it around.

>> Pfft! >> Right! You win some.
You lose some.

24:16.830 --> 24:21.340
The money will come rolling in soon.
>> I guess I was hoping maybe

you'd be gearing up for... Retirement soon?
>> No, I can't retire.

24:26.942 --> 24:31.772
Having a daughter's too expensive, especially
if she's got a friend who's got a taste

24:31.774 --> 24:34.812

there was ever an emergency,

this is it. I'm gonna get the two
of you to that pageant double-time.

24:47.102 --> 24:54.774
I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna get you some
of my credit cards. [ Hair dryer whirring ]

I'm... we're okay. >> Really?

25:04.830 --> 25:08.444
>> We'll be fine. We're gonna
get there, anyway. So...

25:08.446 --> 25:15.292
See, Chloe? It's not our fault.
Of course we thought he was

25:15.294 --> 25:20.924
doing well.
[ Engine turns over ]

25:20.926 --> 25:27.868
Okay, all right. Clearly, we got a little
bit too comfortable, but, honestly, that

25:27.870 --> 25:31.612
stops today, Chloe. Enough is enough, and
this may have been a wake-up call for us.

25:31.614 --> 25:35.388
We're very big girls, and we are going
to get to that pageant on our own steam.

25:35.390 --> 25:39.996
>> And if all else fails, we can always fall
back on our real-estate investment property.

25:39.998 --> 25:42.396
>> No! Chloe, we never
sell that real estate.

25:42.397 --> 25:45.052
You know that.

25:45.054 --> 25:50.524
We bought that property 10 years ago.
It's for our retirement, not to

25:50.526 --> 25:53.660
get us out of a tough spot. It's where number
one and number one are gonna head when

25:53.662 --> 25:57.404
we close up shop. Sheesh.
Thank God I'm here.

25:57.406 --> 26:03.388
Otherwise, you'd sell that... >> [ Voice breaking ] Wait.
I'm, like, feeling some more

>> Again?

26:10.174 --> 26:13.948
>> [ Moans ] >> All right, okay.
Shit.

26:13.950 --> 26:17.948
All right, Chloe, let's just start a
sing-along, and we can distract ourselves.

26:17.950 --> 26:21.884
? Oh-oh-oh >> no, no. I
think I need to talk to

26:21.886 --> 26:26.012
someone. >> Oh. Okay, shoot.

26:26.014 --> 26:33.686
>> No, like, a... Therapist? >> Well, I
mean, I do work in the medical field.

26:35.038 --> 26:39.100
Go on, Ms. west. >> So, after the
powder-puff game, when Stephen said, "let's

26:39.102 --> 26:41.884
break up," it came as a
total shock to me. >> Mmm.

26:41.886 --> 26:45.660
>> Because for starters, and this is really
bringing some stuff up right now, we were both

26:45.662 --> 26:53.020
in "the sound of music." I mean, he was...
[ Girl laughs ]

26:53.022 --> 26:56.156
>> ...we'd just gotten back from the youth-group
ski trip, where he told me liked me on the lift,

26:56.158 --> 26:59.868
and then he fingered me for the first time.
It's not so much that it hurt...

26:59.870 --> 27:02.172
>> can I stop you for one second, Chloe?
I love where you're going with

27:02.174 --> 27:04.124
this, by the way. I think
it's the right direction.

27:04.126 --> 27:09.564
I just think it's gonna be important for you
to remember that you have a really special

27:09.566 --> 27:13.595
friend in Kate. Speaking of her,
she sounds like a great gal.

27:13.597 --> 27:17.052
>> She is. Honestly, sometimes
I wish she could see you.

27:17.054 --> 27:20.284
>> Love to meet her. >> She's wonderful.
You know, let's get back to

27:20.286 --> 27:23.803
Stephen, 'cause there's so much stuff to unpack there.
For instance, the look on his

27:23.805 --> 27:28.412
face when he sees me with that crown on my head.
>> But why are we assuming that

27:28.414 --> 27:33.692
you'll win? >> Oh, I mean, both me and Kate.
We'll both win.

Won't we? >> Actually, I've
never thought about it before.

27:40.989 --> 27:44.315
I don't know that both you and Kate can win.
>> What are you saying?

27:44.317 --> 27:47.292
I don't know. I think
that only one of us can win.

27:47.294 --> 27:49.820
So, one of us will win, and on of us...
>> Will lose?

27:59.806 --> 28:07.478
Listen. I'm starting to feel like
this pageant was a real piss-poor

28:25.950 --> 28:28.604
idea. Why should we even go? I
don't want to win if it means

28:28.606 --> 28:31.324
you'll lose. I couldn't bear a
second of success without you.

28:31.326 --> 28:34.620
I feel the same exact way. >> You know what?
We are not going, and that's it.

28:34.622 --> 28:37.019
You know what? That's it. >> We're not going.
>> We're gonna hitchhike our way

28:37.021 --> 28:40.700
back to New York, and we'll stay with friends.
>> Or new friends that we meet

28:40.702 --> 28:43.612
until we find a place. We
are not going. >> Nope.

28:43.614 --> 28:47.323
I'm not going. >> See, what I hate
about this is putting our young, supple

28:47.325 --> 28:51.228
bodies on parade on the open road.
>> If we hitchhike, we have to

28:51.230 --> 28:54.108
be prepared for what everyone's gonna want.
>> [ Sighs ]

28:54.110 --> 29:00.988
Like, when do we get some peace, people?!
>> Leave us alone.

29:00.990 --> 29:03.484
Whoa.

29:03.486 --> 29:10.588
Ha-cha-cha. >> Mama Mia.
Who is that dark knight?

29:10.590 --> 29:18.262
? Dime-store diamond ? dime-store
diamond >> you little ladies need some

29:22.366 --> 29:26.748
help? I'll send our
resident mechanic out here.

29:26.750 --> 29:30.940
She'll fix your van up in no time.
>> Where exactly do you live?

29:30.942 --> 29:38.614
In a safe haven, where the fraudulent
chains of patriarchy don't bind you.

29:38.686 --> 29:44.284
Aah! >> ? dime-store
diamond [ Insects chirping ]

29:44.286 --> 29:48.220
That was amazing. All right.
You all right there, Chloe?

29:48.221 --> 29:52.955
I'm okay. >> Okay, just...
>> I'm okay.

29:52.957 --> 30:00.630
Ah, the classics.
Oh! Ah. Neat.

30:01.214 --> 30:06.012
Good for her. >> Hey, come on in!
Come on in. There they are.

30:06.014 --> 30:09.852
Sit right down here. >> Thank you.
Looks delicious.

30:09.854 --> 30:14.843
Wow. >> Well, take and pass along.
Who has the salt and pepper?

30:14.845 --> 30:19.643
So, where were you women headed when I picked you up?
>> Well, we are headed back home

30:19.645 --> 30:25.308
to New York City. We were originally
headed to compete in this beauty pageant.

30:25.309 --> 30:31.836
Beauty pageant? The very same men who
would put women up on a stage to degrade

30:31.838 --> 30:36.284
and judge them are the very same men
we wear these whistles in protest of.

30:36.286 --> 30:41.052
I was admiring those. >> The moment a
man is sighted... or, as we call them,

30:41.054 --> 30:44.443
rapists... the whistle is sounded.
>> It should be.

30:44.445 --> 30:48.220
And punishment is duly administered.
>> I never thought of it like

30:48.222 --> 30:52.444
that. >> Ah, we live in a world very
far removed from the competition

30:52.446 --> 30:56.668
of beauty pageants. Here, we don't
compete against other women.

30:56.670 --> 31:04.059
We share our talents together. We share everything.
Now, let's bow our heads in

31:04.061 --> 31:07.004
pagan prayer. >> You know what
they're really saying, don't you?

31:07.006 --> 31:09.596
Yeah, they're not coming out
with it, but the message is clear.

31:09.598 --> 31:13.276
...keep our sisterhood safe. >>
They want us to go to that pageant.

31:13.278 --> 31:17.308
Yep. And we're going. >> ...This
place, where there is only love...

31:17.310 --> 31:20.252
I love you, sister. >> ...Friendship...
>> I love you, too, sister.

Who will lend a talent now? >> Ooh, Chloe will.
Chloe will. >> Oh, no, not tonight.

31:51.134 --> 31:54.972
She's being so modest, you guys.
And all of you will be able to

31:54.974 --> 31:59.260
say you knew her when, because Chloe
here is about to blow up any second.

31:59.262 --> 32:04.475
[ Groans ] >> Go out there!
>> Okay, okay.

32:04.477 --> 32:12.149
Chloe, Chloe! >> I will be performing
a piece by en vogue, entitled

32:12.254 --> 32:16.476
"my lovin'" or
"you're never gonna get it."

[ Whispering ] ? you're never
gonna get my lovin' ?

32:23.262 --> 32:30.934
? never gonna get my lovin' ? I remember how
it used to be ? you never were this nice

32:33.054 --> 32:40.726
? maybe next time... >> What did
I tell you guys? Is she a star?

32:41.854 --> 32:44.859
[ Monotone ] And now it's time
for a breakdown. [ Whispering ]

[ Light applause ] Not too shabby.
>> So nice to have young blood

solstice is gonna go the

way of the dodo bird unless we find
another way to market it to young people.

33:11.166 --> 33:14.940
I mean... >> Oh, my God, that's so sad.
[ Gasps ]

33:14.942 --> 33:18.524
I'm sorry. You guys, everybody here
knows that Kate is, like, a hugely

33:18.526 --> 33:21.212
high-powered c.E.O, right? >> I
don't like to talk about it.

33:21.214 --> 33:23.963
No, no, no. Kate could help you guys
come up with a new business plan in her

33:23.965 --> 33:26.075

up there and do what you do?

33:26.077 --> 33:29.948

Because I like you guys.

>> All right, all right.

33:35.325 --> 33:38.076
Um... [ Clears throat ] Okay.

33:38.077 --> 33:43.067
Let me think. Let me think. Um...
Okay, so you need younger

33:43.069 --> 33:46.299
members. That's the problem.
>> Mm-hmm.

33:46.301 --> 33:50.876
Okay, we can do that. So, what do you do?
What do you do? What do you do?

33:50.878 --> 33:57.755
You could go to another country, and you
round up... you round up a bunch of women.

33:57.757 --> 34:03.452
So, you fly them over here. No, I'm
so sorry, actually. You don't.

34:03.454 --> 34:06.395
Because part of a successful business
plan is keeping the costs low.

34:06.397 --> 34:12.860
So, you put them in a bunch of big boats.
You really just stuff them in

34:12.862 --> 34:17.723
there. Then, they have a
nice, cozy ride over here.

34:17.725 --> 34:25.397
And then, voilà, they're here. They work the land
by day, and at night, maybe they develop new

34:25.630 --> 34:30.492
types of music. They become very popular.
And, eventually, everyone wants

34:30.494 --> 34:34.716
to be just like them. [ Light
applause ] [ Insects chirping ]

34:34.717 --> 34:39.931

She should have said, "thank
you." >> Right! I mean, right?

36:37.117 --> 36:40.923
I don't know. I guess maybe there's
a possibility that they didn't

36:40.925 --> 36:43.835
like us like that. >> There
was a remote possibility.

36:43.837 --> 36:47.356

out of the back of the van.

the wrong way. >> Never.

If you were to, say, hunker down, really just
kind of refine anything before we get there...

38:16.573 --> 38:19.228
and don't take this the wrong way.
>> Chloe, I couldn't.

38:19.230 --> 38:25.595
I would give a little more thought to the q&a
portion, simply based on the proposal you

38:25.597 --> 38:31.067
outlined for the sisters. I just feel like
sometimes you have so many brilliant ideas...

38:31.069 --> 38:33.980

have a clue what you're talking about.

Hmm... You know, what you saw
with the sisters, that was idle

38:46.814 --> 38:49.659

because when I get to

the pageant, I'm gonna be blowing it out.
>> Totally!

38:52.830 --> 38:55.867

anything is because it doesn't

matter who wins.
>> Right.

to tell you, as your best friend...

I don't want you to get upset, but I think
you may want to work on the singing a little

39:34.237 --> 39:39.547
bit. I'm just not sure that it's
totally as in the bag as you

39:39.549 --> 39:44.091
think it is. >> How do you mean?
>> Well, I don't want you to get

39:44.093 --> 39:48.283
upset because I think that you have
such a beautiful voice. >> Thank you.

39:48.285 --> 39:53.723

in the box or what, but I think it's gonna

I can only tell you what it's worth... $40.
>> This shit is her life.

41:34.685 --> 41:40.123
This is her entire universe. So, I guess I'm
just to infer that this person standing beside

41:40.125 --> 41:42.203
me is worth $40? >> Mm-hmm.
>> No.

41:42.205 --> 41:45.179
You're not making this easier. >> $40, sweet peas.
Take her or leave her.

41:45.181 --> 41:47.259
Wait, Kate. Which prized
possessions did you bring?

41:47.261 --> 41:53.083
Maybe they can sweeten the pot. >> Oh.
Yes. >> Right. But what's in it?

Do you mean, besides my hormones?
>> What's your prized

>> That's all you brought on a

anything, but I don't think that's true.
