WEBVTT

00:02.586 --> 00:04.087
What you looking at?

00:04.129 --> 00:05.965
Reese's report card.

00:06.005 --> 00:07.257
It is much better

00:06.005 --> 00:07.257
than last time.

00:07.299 --> 00:08.049
Really?

00:08.091 --> 00:09.134
Yeah. This time he used

00:09.176 --> 00:10.469
the exact same brand of pen

00:10.511 --> 00:12.053
as the teacher

00:10.511 --> 00:12.053
to change his grade.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.054
Look at that.

00:13.096 --> 00:14.890
He gave himself

00:13.096 --> 00:14.890
a "C" in math

00:14.932 --> 00:15.850
instead of an A+.

00:15.891 --> 00:16.976
Yeah, it's subtle.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.435
Nice attention

00:17.017 --> 00:18.435
to detail.

00:18.477 --> 00:19.728
He's really learning.

00:19.770 --> 00:21.104
Two months grounded?

00:21.146 --> 00:23.148
Three months

00:21.146 --> 00:23.148
scrubbing toilets.

01:01.353 --> 01:02.396
Hey!

01:02.437 --> 01:03.188
Ow!

01:03.230 --> 01:04.481
My sandwich!

01:04.523 --> 01:05.566
It's mine now.

01:05.607 --> 01:06.483
Moving van!

01:06.525 --> 01:09.403
We've got a moving van

01:06.525 --> 01:09.403
next door!

01:13.198 --> 01:15.534
Ooh, espresso-maker.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.286
Leather couch... I'm thinking

01:15.576 --> 01:18.286
upscale professional.

01:18.328 --> 01:19.413
Well, if they're living here,

01:19.454 --> 01:21.206
they haven't managed

01:19.454 --> 01:21.206
their money very well.

01:21.248 --> 01:23.333
Families keep moving

01:21.248 --> 01:23.333
in and out of that house.

01:23.375 --> 01:24.376
I wonder why.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.130
(grunting)

01:34.177 --> 01:35.596
Whoa!

01:48.191 --> 01:50.110
(clattering)

01:53.781 --> 01:55.365
Maybe the house is haunted.

01:55.407 --> 01:56.617
Table saw!

01:56.658 --> 01:59.078
No, Hal.

01:56.658 --> 01:59.078
No borrowing.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.537
We have a clean slate

01:59.119 --> 02:00.537
with these people.

02:00.579 --> 02:01.622
We're going to behave.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.582
I want to have one

02:01.663 --> 02:03.582
person on this earth

02:03.624 --> 02:04.792
who can pick up the mail.

02:04.833 --> 02:05.960
Your mother's right.

02:06.001 --> 02:08.169
Doesn't hurt to have

02:06.001 --> 02:08.169
allies on the block,

02:08.211 --> 02:09.838
especially allies with a pool.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.173
We just got to make sure

02:09.880 --> 02:12.173
we get to them

02:12.215 --> 02:14.384
before the Reeds can

02:12.215 --> 02:14.384
poison them against us.

02:14.426 --> 02:15.636
Or the McCartys.

02:15.677 --> 02:16.553
Or the Whitfords.

02:16.595 --> 02:18.179
We definitely need

02:16.595 --> 02:18.179
to get to them

02:18.221 --> 02:19.180
before the Whitfords.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.808
I see Mrs. Schneider circling.

02:20.849 --> 02:22.225
Go, go, go, go,

02:20.849 --> 02:22.225
go, go, go, go!

02:30.484 --> 02:32.486
Ten-hut!

02:32.527 --> 02:34.279
When you men are done here,

02:34.321 --> 02:37.198
I expect to see each

02:34.321 --> 02:37.198
and every one of you

02:37.240 --> 02:38.826
on the parade ground

02:38.867 --> 02:41.202
practicing

02:38.867 --> 02:41.202
your close order drill.

02:41.244 --> 02:43.122
But, sir, we just did

02:41.244 --> 02:43.122
close order drill.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.498
Is that what that was?

02:44.539 --> 02:48.209
It looked like physical therapy

02:44.539 --> 02:48.209
at a head trauma ward.

02:48.251 --> 02:51.212
Sir, we've been cleaning

02:48.251 --> 02:51.212
and drilling for 36 hours.

02:51.254 --> 02:54.215
I think, by law, we're supposed

02:51.254 --> 02:54.215
to be allowed to sleep.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.801
Why are we doing this?

02:55.843 --> 02:58.470
Well, this was supposed

02:55.843 --> 02:58.470
to be a surprise,

02:58.512 --> 03:01.515
but I can no longer contain

02:58.512 --> 03:01.515
my excitement.

03:01.556 --> 03:04.267
Marlin Academy is

03:01.556 --> 03:04.267
about to be visited

03:04.309 --> 03:07.104
by one

03:04.309 --> 03:07.104
of the last living heroes.

03:07.146 --> 03:08.271
Gentlemen,

03:08.313 --> 03:11.483
Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North,

03:11.525 --> 03:15.154
United States Marine Corps,

03:11.525 --> 03:15.154
Retired, is coming here

03:15.194 --> 03:17.447
to give you

03:15.194 --> 03:17.447
a motivational speech.

03:17.489 --> 03:19.616
Sir, isn't he a

03:17.489 --> 03:19.616
convicted felon?

03:19.658 --> 03:21.827
That conviction was overturned.

03:21.869 --> 03:24.496
So was mine,

03:21.869 --> 03:24.496
but I'm still stuck here.

03:24.538 --> 03:28.167
Well, if you had

03:24.538 --> 03:28.167
a Bronze Star,

03:28.207 --> 03:29.960
a Silver Star,

03:28.207 --> 03:29.960
two Purple Hearts,

03:30.002 --> 03:32.337
and a nationally syndicated

03:30.002 --> 03:32.337
radio call-in show,

03:32.379 --> 03:34.173
then maybe you

03:32.379 --> 03:34.173
could have had

03:34.213 --> 03:35.090
a deal.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.676
But since you don't...

03:37.718 --> 03:40.929
you can shut

03:37.718 --> 03:40.929
your piehole!

03:45.392 --> 03:47.769
This is nice, Tina.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.270
You didn't have

03:47.811 --> 03:49.270
to barbecue.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.564
Well, you're the

03:49.312 --> 03:50.564
first neighbors

03:50.605 --> 03:51.773
to come by

03:50.605 --> 03:51.773
and say hello.

03:51.815 --> 03:53.192
Well, that's not surprising.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.194
I don't want to speak ill

03:53.233 --> 03:55.194
of anybody

03:55.235 --> 03:56.653
and I won't say who,

03:56.695 --> 03:58.864
but some of our neighbors are

03:56.695 --> 03:58.864
prone to paranoid fantasies.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.782
Oh, yeah, don't get me

03:58.906 --> 04:00.782
started on the stories.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.367
Hal...

04:00.824 --> 04:02.367
Yeah.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.285
So, what's there to do

04:02.409 --> 04:04.285
around here?

04:04.327 --> 04:08.707
Well, there's a pothole

04:04.327 --> 04:08.707
we like to jump with our bikes.

04:08.749 --> 04:11.793
They filled it.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.712
There's a dead squirrel

04:11.835 --> 04:13.712
we like to poke at.

04:13.754 --> 04:15.714
That should be good

04:13.754 --> 04:15.714
for a few more days.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.549
And there's always

04:15.756 --> 04:17.549
the dried-up creek

04:17.591 --> 04:20.802
and the flooded park.

04:20.844 --> 04:23.222
Boy, if it wasn't

04:20.844 --> 04:23.222
for that squirrel,

04:23.263 --> 04:25.599
my life would be

04:23.263 --> 04:25.599
really pathetic.

04:25.640 --> 04:29.519
Wait, wait, you,

04:25.640 --> 04:29.519
you only flipped 'em once?

04:29.561 --> 04:33.314
I feel every patty

04:29.561 --> 04:33.314
has a moment.

04:33.356 --> 04:36.235
See, I always rush it.

04:36.276 --> 04:40.030
Factor in the fat

04:36.276 --> 04:40.030
content, Hal.

04:40.072 --> 04:41.740
Hey, do you have

04:40.072 --> 04:41.740
a good doctor?

04:41.782 --> 04:43.158
Why, is something wrong?

04:43.200 --> 04:44.910
Well, neck pain.

04:44.952 --> 04:45.953
Or back pain.

04:45.994 --> 04:48.830
Whatever will get him

04:45.994 --> 04:48.830
to write the prescription.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.250
No, I'm sorry.

04:48.872 --> 04:51.250
My doctor's honest.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.334
Too bad.

04:53.376 --> 04:55.170
I'll let you know

04:53.376 --> 04:55.170
if I find one.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.975
I wouldn't stare

05:05.973 --> 05:07.975
at him like that.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.975
He'll get angry.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.559
No, he won't. He's friendly.

05:09.601 --> 05:11.145
Tell that to the kid

05:09.601 --> 05:11.145
he ate.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.437
What kid?

05:12.479 --> 05:13.605
That's why we had to move.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.356
Didn't you read about it

05:13.647 --> 05:15.356
in the newspaper?

05:15.398 --> 05:16.191
No.

05:16.233 --> 05:17.276
Just as well.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.028
Pictures were really gruesome.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.409
I did it.

05:25.200 --> 05:26.409
I did it!

05:26.451 --> 05:28.328
See? I told you you could.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.248
Can I have another burger?

05:29.621 --> 05:31.248
Malcolm spit on mine.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.000
What?

05:33.041 --> 05:35.669
Malcolm, why would

05:33.041 --> 05:35.669
you do such a thing?

05:33.041 --> 05:35.669
But I didn't...

05:35.710 --> 05:37.420
Yeah, yeah, here.

05:37.462 --> 05:39.506
There. Now beat it.

05:43.302 --> 05:46.387
Why are you staring at me?

05:46.429 --> 05:49.390
What, do you want a chip?

05:49.432 --> 05:51.810
Ow! Cut it out!

05:51.852 --> 05:53.394
Ow! What are you doing?!

05:53.436 --> 05:54.437
Stop it!

05:54.479 --> 05:56.315
(laughing)

05:58.150 --> 05:59.818
I think there are

05:58.150 --> 05:59.818
some briquettes

05:59.860 --> 06:01.486
in one of these boxes.

06:04.114 --> 06:05.490
(gasps)

06:12.914 --> 06:14.333
Is this heaven?

06:14.373 --> 06:17.418
Wow, look at this collection.

06:17.460 --> 06:21.298
Oh, Doobie Brothers,

06:17.460 --> 06:21.298
King Crimson.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.050
Oh, Cheap Trick... hello!

06:23.091 --> 06:24.134
You like vinyl?

06:24.176 --> 06:25.135
Oh, yeah.

06:25.177 --> 06:26.385
Check this out.

06:36.563 --> 06:40.275
Is that a Shirendorff 1280

06:36.563 --> 06:40.275
turntable?

06:40.317 --> 06:41.442
1290.

06:41.484 --> 06:43.362
(gasps softly)

06:43.402 --> 06:45.864
Why did you say

06:43.402 --> 06:45.864
I spit on your burger?

06:45.906 --> 06:47.448
Don't worry about it.

06:47.490 --> 06:48.867
Want to see something funny?

06:48.909 --> 06:51.078
Hey, quit staring

06:48.909 --> 06:51.078
at my mom's chest.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.453
What? I'm not.

06:52.495 --> 06:54.956
Malcolm, knock it off!

06:52.495 --> 06:54.956
But I-I wasn't...

06:54.998 --> 06:56.875
REESE:

06:54.998 --> 06:56.875
Aah, get away from me!

06:56.917 --> 06:58.668
Aah! Get away from me!

06:58.710 --> 07:01.462
Your daughter is

06:58.710 --> 07:01.462
biting my son.

07:01.504 --> 07:02.881
Oh, no, they're

07:01.504 --> 07:02.881
just playing.

07:02.923 --> 07:06.176
Ow! It hurts!

07:02.923 --> 07:06.176
It hurts! Mommy!

07:07.010 --> 07:08.803
(laughing)

07:10.180 --> 07:12.140
Now, honey, if you

07:10.180 --> 07:12.140
want to breathe,

07:12.182 --> 07:15.185
you're going to have to open

07:12.182 --> 07:15.185
your mouth and let go of my son.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.478
What are you doing?

07:17.520 --> 07:19.314
Just a little trick I picked up.

07:19.356 --> 07:21.858
How dare you touch my daughter.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.318
She was gnawing

07:21.900 --> 07:23.318
on my son.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.945
If you're not going

07:23.360 --> 07:24.945
to control her...

07:24.986 --> 07:26.696
Are you questioning

07:24.986 --> 07:26.696
my parenting?

07:26.738 --> 07:28.740
I don't know.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.740
I haven't seen it yet.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.701
How nice. This from

07:28.782 --> 07:31.701
a woman raising a pervert.

07:31.743 --> 07:33.161
Where was he

07:31.743 --> 07:33.161
supposed to look?

07:33.203 --> 07:34.871
You got 'em laid out like

07:33.203 --> 07:34.871
a couple eggs on a plate.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.497
I wasn't...

07:34.913 --> 07:36.497
Emily, Josh,

07:36.539 --> 07:37.916
I don't want you playing

07:37.958 --> 07:39.793
with these awful children

07:37.958 --> 07:39.793
anymore.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.711
Hey, my...!

07:39.834 --> 07:41.711
Well, they may be awful,

07:41.753 --> 07:44.589
but they're a hell of a lot

07:41.753 --> 07:44.589
better than your two brats.

A little help?

08:18.581 --> 08:20.625
(chuckles)

08:18.581 --> 08:20.625
This is nice.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.543
Yeah.

08:20.667 --> 08:22.543
You know, you may

08:20.667 --> 08:22.543
not believe this,

08:22.585 --> 08:25.630
but you're the first neighbor

08:22.585 --> 08:25.630
friend I've ever had.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.923
No way.

08:25.672 --> 08:26.923
Yeah.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.549
In fact, you're the first guy

08:26.965 --> 08:28.549
who's ever been

08:28.591 --> 08:29.801
back here that didn't work

08:28.591 --> 08:29.801
for the power company.

08:29.843 --> 08:32.346
Actually, I have

08:29.843 --> 08:32.346
a confession to make.

08:32.387 --> 08:34.764
I don't have many

08:32.387 --> 08:34.764
male friends myself.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.557
To friendship.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.226
To friendship.

08:43.606 --> 08:44.774
I'm straight.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.567
Me, too.

08:46.609 --> 08:48.862
Malcolm, what's going on?

08:48.903 --> 08:50.655
Get away. I'm not

08:48.903 --> 08:50.655
talking to you.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.572
Why? What'd I do?

08:51.614 --> 08:53.574
You keep telling

08:51.614 --> 08:53.574
lies about me.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.576
Come on, man.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.576
It's just a joke.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.578
I-I didn't know

08:55.618 --> 08:57.578
you were so sensitive.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.663
Excuse me.

08:58.705 --> 09:00.957
My friend here thinks

08:58.705 --> 09:00.957
you're really pretty.

09:00.999 --> 09:01.958
No, I don't, I mean...

09:02.000 --> 09:03.584
Come on, Malcolm, just tell her.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.879
Okay, maybe then you'll stop

09:03.626 --> 09:05.879
following her around everywhere.

09:05.920 --> 09:09.549
I am telling you,

09:05.920 --> 09:09.549
it is not healthy.

09:11.843 --> 09:15.680
Aah! Your mom said

09:11.843 --> 09:15.680
to stay away from us!

09:15.722 --> 09:17.891
(laughing)

09:17.932 --> 09:20.268
(Reese screaming)

09:20.310 --> 09:21.520
TINA:

09:20.310 --> 09:21.520
Damn it!

09:21.561 --> 09:23.980
Damn it, Hector,

09:21.561 --> 09:23.980
not over there!

09:24.022 --> 09:26.900
Are you deaf or stupid or both?!

09:26.941 --> 09:30.153
Could you please try

09:26.941 --> 09:30.153
to be a little less useless?

09:30.945 --> 09:32.239
Where is the sun?

09:32.280 --> 09:34.032
Do you see the sun?!

09:34.074 --> 09:37.285
I told you to dig the holes

09:34.074 --> 09:37.285
over there!

09:37.327 --> 09:38.619
El sol?!

09:38.661 --> 09:41.706
God, you people drive me nuts

09:38.661 --> 09:41.706
with your laziness!

09:41.748 --> 09:44.625
What is the matter with you?!

09:44.667 --> 09:45.835
Excuse me?

09:45.877 --> 09:47.712
You can't talk to him like that!

09:47.754 --> 09:48.838
He's a human being.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.465
You talk to him like

09:50.507 --> 09:51.632
he's some kind of animal.

09:51.674 --> 09:55.303
I will deal with the help

09:51.674 --> 09:55.303
the way I want to.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.181
He is not "the help."

09:59.558 --> 10:00.934
He's not a servant

09:59.558 --> 10:00.934
or a slave.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.352
He's a professional.

10:02.394 --> 10:04.312
He's a person with a skill--

10:04.354 --> 10:07.899
a skill you do not have,

10:04.354 --> 10:07.899
which is why you hired him!

10:07.941 --> 10:08.858
Oh, for God's sake,

10:08.900 --> 10:11.319
just pick it up!

10:17.867 --> 10:19.536
(screams)

10:21.204 --> 10:23.123
Who does that woman

10:21.204 --> 10:23.123
think she is?

10:23.164 --> 10:25.666
Suddenly fake boobs

10:23.164 --> 10:25.666
and $50 highlights

10:25.708 --> 10:28.378
allow you to treat other people

10:25.708 --> 10:28.378
like dirt?

10:28.420 --> 10:30.171
I tell you, Hal,

10:28.420 --> 10:30.171
they are officially

10:30.213 --> 10:31.672
the worst neighbors

10:30.213 --> 10:31.672
we've ever had.

10:31.714 --> 10:33.258
Worst neighbors?

10:33.300 --> 10:36.136
Honey, that's

10:33.300 --> 10:36.136
not really fair to Mike.

10:36.177 --> 10:38.679
Remember the 70-year-old

10:36.177 --> 10:38.679
swingers?

10:38.721 --> 10:39.931
Dad, they're horrible.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.767
Look at what their little

10:39.973 --> 10:42.767
piranha did to me.

10:42.809 --> 10:46.521
Every time I go outside,

10:42.809 --> 10:46.521
Emily's there, lying in wait.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.689
Yeah, and that kid Josh

10:46.563 --> 10:48.689
keeps making up

10:48.731 --> 10:50.484
all these weird lies about me.

10:50.525 --> 10:51.734
He told the whole school

10:51.776 --> 10:54.571
that I was born with both

10:51.776 --> 10:54.571
sex organs and raised as a girl

10:54.613 --> 10:55.530
until I was five.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.158
Their gnome wants to eat me.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.284
It's evil.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.702
They're all evil, sweetie.

11:01.744 --> 11:05.706
I think the word everyone

11:01.744 --> 11:05.706
is tiptoeing around is "feud."

11:05.748 --> 11:07.750
That's a bit drastic, Reese.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.337
No, Dad, a feud is just

11:07.792 --> 11:10.337
what this family needs.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.631
Having a common enemy

11:10.378 --> 11:12.631
will hone our skills

11:12.671 --> 11:13.714
and unite us

11:13.756 --> 11:15.634
in a brotherhood

11:13.756 --> 11:15.634
of blood.

11:15.674 --> 11:18.719
Look, all I'm saying is that,

11:15.674 --> 11:18.719
before we judge them,

11:18.761 --> 11:22.140
maybe we should take a long,

11:18.761 --> 11:22.140
hard look at ourselves.

11:25.768 --> 11:26.894
Oh, never mind.

11:26.936 --> 11:30.689
(Emily giggling)

11:33.568 --> 11:35.654
(Emily giggling)

11:43.786 --> 11:45.455
(Emily giggling)

11:45.497 --> 11:47.790
Ow!

11:47.832 --> 11:50.377
No! No! No!

11:50.418 --> 11:53.380
Do you think Colonel North

11:50.418 --> 11:53.380
is going to be impressed

11:53.421 --> 11:56.007
by such a sloppy

11:53.421 --> 11:56.007
group of cadets?

11:56.049 --> 11:58.677
Now, we are

11:56.049 --> 11:58.677
going to do this

11:58.717 --> 12:02.055
and keep doing it

11:58.717 --> 12:02.055
until you get it right!

12:02.096 --> 12:04.765
All right, now, once more.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.434
With feeling.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.045
I'm going crazy.

13:16.087 --> 13:18.465
Aren't you the one

13:16.087 --> 13:18.465
who wanted a feud?

13:18.506 --> 13:21.092
Malcolm, you know

13:18.506 --> 13:21.092
I don't think things through.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.843
How am I supposed to fight her?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.554
I can't hit her.

13:24.596 --> 13:27.848
I can't do anything to her,

13:24.596 --> 13:27.848
and she knows it.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.684
I'm completely defenseless.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.144
Reese, she's four.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.853
You're bigger

13:31.185 --> 13:32.853
and smarter than...

13:32.895 --> 13:34.689
Well, you're bigger.

13:34.731 --> 13:37.066
LOIS:

13:34.731 --> 13:37.066
Malcolm, would you

13:34.731 --> 13:37.066
come out here, please?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.988
Malcolm, these people

13:39.360 --> 13:41.988
would like a word with you.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.249
We've had a report

13:51.331 --> 13:53.249
that you've been seen prowling

13:53.291 --> 13:55.876
in the neighbors' yards

13:53.291 --> 13:55.876
and peeking in their windows.

13:55.918 --> 13:56.877
What?

13:56.919 --> 13:57.962
So you've decided

13:58.004 --> 14:00.047
to become a

13:58.004 --> 14:00.047
Peeping Tom?

14:00.089 --> 14:01.466
A Peeping Tom?!

14:01.508 --> 14:02.883
But I didn't do it.

14:02.925 --> 14:04.678
Why would I want to look

14:02.925 --> 14:04.678
in anybody's windows?

14:04.719 --> 14:06.387
Have you seen the people

14:04.719 --> 14:06.387
in this neighborhood?

14:06.429 --> 14:08.139
Peeping isn't

14:06.429 --> 14:08.139
about looks, son.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.600
It's about the thrill

14:08.181 --> 14:10.600
and exhilaration

14:10.642 --> 14:13.561
of observing someone

14:10.642 --> 14:13.561
without their knowledge.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.992
(rock clinking against glass)

14:32.413 --> 14:35.041

14:37.544 --> 14:38.837
You still have to go to Dayton?

14:38.878 --> 14:42.089
Yeah, but it's only

14:38.878 --> 14:42.089
a couple of days.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.759
How was your presentation?

14:44.801 --> 14:47.261
Oh, great. Your joke killed.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.806
Look at us.

14:49.848 --> 14:52.308
We've been reduced

14:49.848 --> 14:52.308
to sneaking around at night.

14:52.350 --> 14:55.729
A man should be able to talk

14:52.350 --> 14:55.729
to his best friend in daylight.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.980
Did you say "best"?

15:00.859 --> 15:02.569
I should go.

15:19.794 --> 15:21.962
This has been going on for days.

15:22.004 --> 15:25.966
I can't believe everybody fell

15:22.004 --> 15:25.966
for Josh's stupid lie.

15:26.008 --> 15:29.554
Maybe if I just ignore it

15:26.008 --> 15:29.554
for a while, it'll go away.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.972

16:17.059 --> 16:18.394
What don't you come out here

16:18.436 --> 16:20.605
and apologize to me

16:18.436 --> 16:20.605
like an adult?!

16:20.647 --> 16:22.064
Oh!

16:22.106 --> 16:26.026
Oh, that's real mature.

16:26.068 --> 16:29.989
Don't think you can

16:26.068 --> 16:29.989
get rid of me so easy!

16:36.078 --> 16:37.497
Fine.

16:37.538 --> 16:40.040
That's the way

16:37.538 --> 16:40.040
you want it to be?

16:40.082 --> 16:44.003
You'll get these back

16:40.082 --> 16:44.003
when you fix my hedges!

16:54.806 --> 16:58.309
(screaming)

16:58.351 --> 16:59.853
What's going on?

16:59.894 --> 17:01.270
We're on our fifth rendition

16:59.894 --> 17:01.270
of "Candy Man."

17:01.312 --> 17:02.355
Where is Spangler?

17:02.396 --> 17:03.356
He says

17:02.396 --> 17:03.356
he's not ready.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.273
What's he trying to do?

17:04.315 --> 17:05.525
Make a fashionable entrance?

17:05.566 --> 17:08.068
North's been waiting for dinner

17:05.566 --> 17:08.068
for 45 minutes.

17:08.110 --> 17:10.488
He's going to fill up

17:08.110 --> 17:10.488
on cheese and crackers.

17:14.575 --> 17:15.535
Huh?

17:15.576 --> 17:16.870
Are you all right, sir?

17:16.911 --> 17:21.081
I am a little under the weather.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.917
You're drunk, sir.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.085
That could be why.

17:25.127 --> 17:28.965
I was a tad nervous

17:25.127 --> 17:28.965
about Colonel North's visit.

17:29.007 --> 17:32.092
I thought that a little nip

17:29.007 --> 17:32.092
of something might help.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.303
That, and seven or eight

17:32.134 --> 17:34.303
belts of Scotch.

17:34.345 --> 17:36.806
Let's get you dressed.

17:36.848 --> 17:38.892
And attached.

17:38.933 --> 17:42.562
The man is a national hero.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.146
He has done so many things

17:44.188 --> 17:47.734
and I have done so little.

17:47.775 --> 17:51.278
I don't deserve to breathe

17:47.775 --> 17:51.278
the same air as that great man.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.739
Don't talk like that, sir.

17:52.780 --> 17:54.114
No!

17:54.156 --> 17:55.992
I'm a worm.

17:56.034 --> 17:58.118
Cadet, I'm a worm.

17:58.160 --> 18:01.622
I belong on the floor

17:58.160 --> 18:01.622
with the other worms.

18:01.664 --> 18:04.500
Sir, get up.

18:04.542 --> 18:07.127
Sir, please stop wriggling.

18:07.169 --> 18:08.588
(snores)

18:08.629 --> 18:09.839
Sir?

18:12.174 --> 18:14.134
Look, we just sneak

18:12.174 --> 18:14.134
over the fence,

18:14.176 --> 18:16.012
plant the stolen goods

18:14.176 --> 18:16.012
under Josh's window,

18:16.054 --> 18:18.014
and make an anonymous

18:16.054 --> 18:18.014
phone call to the police

18:18.056 --> 18:19.724
from Stevie's house.

18:19.766 --> 18:22.142
Yeah, I know it's stupid,

18:19.766 --> 18:22.142
but I'm too desperate to care.

18:22.184 --> 18:24.228
Are you sure

18:22.184 --> 18:24.228
this is going to work?

18:24.270 --> 18:25.605
If there's one thing

18:24.270 --> 18:25.605
I've learned,

18:25.646 --> 18:27.189
it's you can't

18:25.646 --> 18:27.189
clear your own name.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.942
You can only ruin

18:27.231 --> 18:28.942
someone else's.

18:28.983 --> 18:30.150
Yeah, but...

18:28.983 --> 18:30.150
Trust me.

18:30.192 --> 18:31.151
I've thought of everything.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.153
Everyone's going to think

18:31.193 --> 18:33.153
Josh is a thief.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.155
His parents are going

18:33.195 --> 18:35.155
to be tied up in court

18:35.197 --> 18:37.366
and Emily's going to be

18:35.197 --> 18:37.366
thrown in a foster home

18:37.408 --> 18:39.035
where she'll bite

18:37.408 --> 18:39.035
her foster parents,

18:39.077 --> 18:41.037
who will then leave her

18:39.077 --> 18:41.037
at a rest stop somewhere,

18:41.079 --> 18:42.580
and she can spend

18:41.079 --> 18:42.580
the rest of her life

18:42.622 --> 18:44.457
biting hillbillies

18:42.622 --> 18:44.457
on the interstate.

18:44.498 --> 18:46.125
Okay.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.674
(grunting)

18:57.219 --> 18:59.388
(giggling)

18:59.430 --> 19:02.141
My God, you people are handsome.

19:04.685 --> 19:06.854
(screams)

19:06.896 --> 19:09.857
Dios mío!

19:09.899 --> 19:12.151
(screaming)

19:14.946 --> 19:16.072
Oh, oh!

19:16.114 --> 19:18.699
Oh, you little monsters!

19:25.247 --> 19:28.167
He's teaching me to swim.

19:30.252 --> 19:32.588
I can't believe after

19:30.252 --> 19:32.588
all he put us through,

19:32.630 --> 19:33.506
Spangler ends up

19:32.630 --> 19:33.506
getting drunk

19:33.547 --> 19:34.715
and standing up

19:33.547 --> 19:34.715
the colonel.

19:34.757 --> 19:36.216
Yeah, that was creepy

19:36.258 --> 19:38.094
the way he was wriggling

19:36.258 --> 19:38.094
around on the floor like that,

19:38.136 --> 19:39.219
calling for his mother.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.721
I'll go check on him.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.018
Sir?

19:45.059 --> 19:46.310
Who's there?

19:46.352 --> 19:49.188
Uh, just me, sir.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.233
What time is it?

19:53.275 --> 19:55.235
Colonel North should

19:53.275 --> 19:55.235
be here any minute.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.946
It's morning, sir.

19:56.988 --> 19:58.614
You, you already missed

19:56.988 --> 19:58.614
reveille.

19:58.656 --> 20:02.242
Oh, my God.

20:02.284 --> 20:05.204
Oh, my God.

20:06.873 --> 20:11.127
The one chance I had to be

20:06.873 --> 20:11.127
face-to-face with my hero,

20:11.169 --> 20:15.422
and I slept through his visit?

20:15.464 --> 20:17.133
Slept through his visit, sir?

20:17.175 --> 20:19.259
You guys were

20:17.175 --> 20:19.259
up all night talking.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.261
We did?

20:21.303 --> 20:22.889
Yeah, you really hit it off.

20:22.930 --> 20:24.348
He told you to call him Ollie.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.266
Really?

20:24.390 --> 20:26.266
Don't you remember?

20:26.308 --> 20:30.270
You two were joking and laughing

20:26.308 --> 20:30.270
like old friends.

20:30.312 --> 20:33.440
And drinking Scotch,

20:30.312 --> 20:33.440
lots and lots of Scotch.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.861
Yes, we did, didn't we?

20:36.903 --> 20:38.278
If I may say so, sir,

20:38.320 --> 20:40.447
you were the happiest

20:38.320 --> 20:40.447
I have ever seen you.

20:40.489 --> 20:44.451
Well, you may... you may.

20:44.493 --> 20:49.498
Now, if you will excuse me,

20:44.493 --> 20:49.498
I have to get myself ready.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.378
Dude, that was classy.

20:54.420 --> 20:55.713
Thanks.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.297
So when do we get back

20:55.755 --> 20:57.297
the pictures

20:57.339 --> 20:58.382
of him in the negligee?

20:58.424 --> 20:59.508
Wednesday.

20:59.550 --> 21:00.801
Poster size takes two days.

21:02.595 --> 21:05.264
Hey, I'm really sorry

21:02.595 --> 21:05.264
about you and Tina.

21:07.349 --> 21:08.935
What's this?

21:08.976 --> 21:10.269
A mix tape.

21:21.739 --> 21:23.616
(indistinct voices)

21:25.034 --> 21:26.410
Hey.

21:26.452 --> 21:29.622
Hi, neighbor. Steve Jenkins.

21:29.663 --> 21:31.373
Sorry, Steve.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.876
It's just too soon for me.
