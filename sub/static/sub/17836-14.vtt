turn on us.

00:11.760 --> 00:15.170

have changed.

00:15.170 --> 00:16.200
And if we did,

00:16.200 --> 00:17.530
would there be any
way to tell?

00:18.140 --> 00:19.170
Ow!

02:26.600 --> 02:27.960
ABEL: Is everything okay?

02:27.960 --> 02:29.400
Yeah,
it's just a flat.

02:29.400 --> 02:30.830
You need some help?

02:30.830 --> 02:32.900
No, I know how to
change a tire, thanks.

02:32.900 --> 02:34.070
I don't know,
that looks pretty bad.

02:34.070 --> 02:37.570
That doesn't look like a flat.
It looks like a blowout.

02:42.380 --> 02:43.610
Hope you got a spare.

02:49.690 --> 02:54.260
Thanks for the concern, guys,
but I'll be okay. Really.

02:54.260 --> 02:57.560
Hold on. I think I found
the cause of your problem.

03:02.270 --> 03:03.770
Ever seen
one of these before?

03:07.700 --> 03:09.670
Maybe you didn't hear me.

03:09.670 --> 03:14.610
I asked you,
have you ever seen
one of these before.

03:14.610 --> 03:18.350

You're not sick.

(STAMMERS) Yeah,
I'm like deathly ill.

It's serious.
I think...

05:03.820 --> 05:05.660
(COUGHING)
I think it's the flu.

05:05.660 --> 05:08.430
It's not flu season.
Uh, then I probably
have pneumonia.

05:08.430 --> 05:11.030
Liam, you're a werewolf.
You can't get pneumonia.

05:11.030 --> 05:13.730
But you know what
you can get is in trouble
for being late to school.

05:13.730 --> 05:15.700
So come on, let's go.

05:15.700 --> 05:17.070
I don't think
I should go to school.

05:17.070 --> 05:20.940
Or outside. Or anywhere.
Ever again.

05:20.940 --> 05:23.510
It doesn't matter
what you think, okay?
Because you gotta go.

05:23.510 --> 05:25.680
Now all you do is pretend
like nothing happened.

05:25.680 --> 05:29.050
Pretend? I'm just
supposed to pretend?

05:31.920 --> 05:34.820
Think of it like
when Superman gets caught
with his glasses off.

05:34.820 --> 05:36.750
You know,
he doesn't give up.

05:36.750 --> 05:40.720
He puts them
back on and says,
"I'm still Clark Kent."

05:40.720 --> 05:42.830
You want me
to wear glasses?

05:42.830 --> 05:45.960
No! I want you
to go to school, okay?
(GRUNTS)

05:45.960 --> 05:48.400
And be Liam Dunbar.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.740
Just like how Superman
has to be Clark Kent,

05:51.740 --> 05:53.800
like Spider-Man,
and Captain America...

05:53.800 --> 05:56.510
Captain America
is just Steve Rogers.

05:56.510 --> 05:58.810
He doesn't have to pretend.
Everyone already loves him.

06:00.180 --> 06:02.410
Unlike us,
who everyone hates.

06:06.520 --> 06:08.790
They hate us for trying
to save their lives.

06:14.520 --> 06:15.630
You're right.

06:17.790 --> 06:19.530
We are trying
to save lives.

06:19.530 --> 06:23.800
Which is why you're gonna
get up and go to school and
pretend like nothing happened.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.840
Because if you don't,
more people could die.

06:28.170 --> 06:29.640
Because of me.

06:34.710 --> 06:36.980

Yeah, but it was late,
it was pitch black out,

08:19.880 --> 08:21.220

on the road.

get out of here.

They didn't just die.

09:01.220 --> 09:02.860

09:05.600 --> 09:09.100
Killed by the new hunter
in Beacon Hills.

09:09.100 --> 09:12.640
You know, when
he took out the Hellhound,
we thought that it was luck.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.340
That we were dealing
with an amateur.

09:14.340 --> 09:17.140
But now we know that
whoever this new hunter is,

09:17.140 --> 09:18.710
he has a teacher.

09:18.710 --> 09:20.980
Gerard.

done anything.

what's coming.

09:41.260 --> 09:42.930

the same word.

from happening?

Right.

09:51.040 --> 09:53.080
We meet face-to-face
with Gerard.
Find out what he wants

09:53.080 --> 09:55.140
and then we stop all this
before it gets any worse.

09:55.140 --> 09:58.210
Last time Gerard
was at a peace meet
was with Deucalion.

09:58.210 --> 10:01.790
He blinded him and
then killed everybody else,
including his own men.

I'll go. Know he's not
going to kill me.

You sure about that?

10:10.690 --> 10:11.930
Not really.

10:14.030 --> 10:17.370
All we need is to
find out what he wants.

10:17.370 --> 10:19.900
Then we can bargain.

10:19.900 --> 10:23.670
Even if he does agree,
his terms might be
difficult to meet.

10:23.670 --> 10:25.410
Well, that's why
it's a negotiation.

to get anything

something up.

to figure out just how much
you're willing to give,

32:06.740 --> 32:08.110
No one's seen anything.
(MUSIC PLAYING)

32:08.110 --> 32:11.510
Please tell me you
didn't put out an APB
on a faceless corpse?

32:11.510 --> 32:14.020
I was a little more
subtle than that.
Good.

32:14.020 --> 32:15.580
But, Sheriff,
we've gotta
find this thing.

32:15.580 --> 32:21.220
Okay, look, what exactly
is this faceless corpse
gonna do?

32:21.220 --> 32:24.190
I mean, is this the thing
that Scott thinks
came out of the Wild Hunt?

32:24.190 --> 32:26.030
I don't know. Maybe.

32:26.030 --> 32:27.560
Or maybe
it's just part of it.

32:27.560 --> 32:30.070
Maybe it's just
another thing
that causes fear.

32:30.070 --> 32:31.770
Like the rats
and the wolves.

32:31.770 --> 32:34.270
Maybe that's how we're
supposed to end up.

32:34.270 --> 32:37.510
Like rats so terrified
they tangle themselves up
and eat each other.

32:37.510 --> 32:39.640
Or wolves that tear
each other apart.

32:40.710 --> 32:42.310
(MUSIC PLAYING)

32:42.310 --> 32:43.350
(GRUNTING)

32:51.190 --> 32:52.290

Get up!

(GRUNTING AND PANTING)
GABE: What are you
trying to hide, Liam?

33:01.660 --> 33:03.200
Your eyes? Huh?

33:05.730 --> 33:07.040
Open your eyes.

33:16.610 --> 33:17.650
(MUSIC PLAYING)
(GUN COCKING)

33:17.650 --> 33:21.250
Hey, hey, hey. We did not
come here to fight.

33:21.250 --> 33:23.250
Well, then you
came here to die.

33:23.250 --> 33:26.250
(GROWLING)
We're trying
to protect you.

33:26.250 --> 33:27.590
You might wanna
control your Beta, Scott.

33:28.620 --> 33:30.230
She could
get you all killed.

33:30.230 --> 33:31.690
LYDIA: We're not the enemy.

33:31.690 --> 33:33.200
There's something else
going on.

33:33.200 --> 33:36.830
We don't know what it is
but we promise you,
there's a bigger problem.

33:36.830 --> 33:39.370
Something worse than
supernatural cannibals?

33:39.370 --> 33:41.140
Yeah, I know
everything now.

33:42.240 --> 33:45.210
Wendigos, oni,
werecoyotes.

33:45.210 --> 33:48.410
People being murdered
as human sacrifices?

33:48.410 --> 33:49.580
We tried to stop those.

33:49.580 --> 33:51.150
And how many people
lost their lives

33:51.150 --> 33:52.580
while you were "trying"?

33:52.580 --> 33:54.750
Too many.
It was twelve.

33:57.320 --> 33:59.750
His son was one of them.

33:59.750 --> 34:02.660
His throat was cut
and his head bashed in.

34:02.660 --> 34:07.200
His brother was a deputy.
Gutted and torn apart.

34:07.200 --> 34:09.630
The official report
read "Animal Attack."

34:13.400 --> 34:16.340
It's amplifying their fear.

34:16.340 --> 34:19.510
You've all lost somebody
and you wanna get revenge,
I get that.

34:19.510 --> 34:21.340
But just listen to me.

34:21.340 --> 34:22.340
Something escaped
the Wild Hunt.

34:22.340 --> 34:24.250
Scott, Scott, it's here.
It's here right now.

34:24.250 --> 34:25.510

Hey. Hey, let him go!

34:46.199 --> 34:47.770
Are you just going
to let us do this to you?

34:50.370 --> 34:52.540
(LIAM GRUNTING)

34:56.210 --> 34:58.710
You know
you can take us.

is change.

The sun,

35:12.330 --> 35:13.360
the moon,

35:14.660 --> 35:16.660
the truth...

35:16.660 --> 35:19.270
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?
Who cares?

35:24.540 --> 35:26.910
(MEN YELLING)

35:26.910 --> 35:29.680
Hey, stop. Stop shooting!

35:29.680 --> 35:30.710
That thing's making
them panic.

hold back forever.

35:56.570 --> 35:57.610
(GROWLS)

36:00.480 --> 36:01.510
Do something.

36:05.680 --> 36:07.780
Sometimes it's...

36:07.780 --> 36:10.250
It's best to let them
work things out
on their own.

the Principal's office!

is this?

I can't believe
you did that.

to negotiate.

You did everything
you could.

No, not everything.

38:42.770 --> 38:43.940
Not yet.

38:50.010 --> 38:52.810
I know what
you were doing.
Trying not to shift.

38:53.980 --> 38:55.820
No, you took
that beating

38:55.820 --> 38:56.850
because you think
you deserve it

38:56.850 --> 38:58.120
because of
what happened
to Brett and Lori.

39:00.590 --> 39:01.920
Maybe I do.

39:01.920 --> 39:03.590
You took a beating,

39:04.690 --> 39:06.760
but you didn't
deserve it.

39:06.760 --> 39:08.900
I know I didn't kill them.

39:10.770 --> 39:12.570
A hunter did.

39:13.670 --> 39:15.600
And she has a name.

Yeah, and she's also
got new recruits too.

you gotta worry about now.

You mean Gabe?
No, I mean,
like, everyone.

39:24.680 --> 39:26.610
Nolan didn't just
want you to shift
in front of everyone

39:26.610 --> 39:28.820
to show them that
you're a werewolf.

39:28.820 --> 39:31.020
He wanted
to show everyone
that you're the enemy.

39:34.090 --> 39:35.890
That we should be hunted.

was that thing?

when a town is overrun
with supernaturals.

40:00.550 --> 40:01.950
I don't know
why you chose me.

40:05.590 --> 40:06.650
I failed.

40:08.560 --> 40:10.060
Scott got away.

40:10.060 --> 40:12.090
He's just one more
wolf to hunt.

40:12.090 --> 40:13.160
You didn't fail.

40:14.660 --> 40:16.100
You gave the people
of Beacon Hills

40:16.100 --> 40:17.130
what they've
always needed.

40:17.700 --> 40:19.430
A voice.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.440
And as a victim yourself,

40:23.200 --> 40:25.670
you make
the perfect messenger.

40:26.870 --> 40:29.710
And what exactly
is our message?

40:30.910 --> 40:33.450
That this world
belongs to us.

A hunter?
