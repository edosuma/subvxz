WEBVTT

00:01.800 --> 00:05.099
Previously on The Good Wife:
An hour ago, I resigned as

00:05.130 --> 00:06.563
State's Attorney
of Cook County.

00:06.600 --> 00:08.488
Dad told us he made mistakes.

00:08.540 --> 00:09.609
Yeah, but not that.

00:09.640 --> 00:11.164
GOLDEN:
Who first told you

00:11.210 --> 00:12.768
of your husband's infidelity,
Mrs. Florrick?

00:12.810 --> 00:15.438
CNBC. I saw it on the crawl
at the bottom of the screen.

00:15.480 --> 00:16.777
PETER: _
I'm glad you're making

00:16.810 --> 00:18.778
a life for yourself.
It gives you a break.

00:18.810 --> 00:20.072
ALICIA:
Well, I just wanted to say

00:20.120 --> 00:21.314
thank you for
the opportunity.

00:21.350 --> 00:22.487
It's a real lifesaver.

00:22.520 --> 00:24.147
No. Glad you could
come aboard.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.487
Looks |ike_we share
an assnstant,

00:25.520 --> 00:27.488
so tell me when I'm
hogging her, okay?

00:27.520 --> 00:28.817
And let the best man win.

00:28.860 --> 00:30.657
You told him Peter
was lonely In prison.

00:30.690 --> 00:32.123
Because he is.

00:32.160 --> 00:34.651
Just don't go around me
by talking to my kids.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.106
Jackie, it'll just have to wait
until next week.

00:42.140 --> 00:43.129
JACKIE:
But Peter's expecting them

00:43.170 --> 00:44.569
for his birthday.

00:44.610 --> 00:47.306
Peter and I agreed
I'd bring the kids next week.

00:47.340 --> 00:48.830
Their first visit
is a big deal.

00:48.880 --> 00:49.869
I want to do it right.

00:49.910 --> 00:54.643
And so, you need me
for how many nights late?

00:54.680 --> 00:55.612
Just a couple,

00:55.650 --> 00:57.845
and I shouldn't be too
late-- 11:00 or so.

00:57.890 --> 00:59.778
What do you want me
to tell Zach and Grace?

00:59.820 --> 01:03.221
Tell them I love them,
and I will call them tonight.

01:03.260 --> 01:05.080
And Peter-- what do I tell him?

01:05.130 --> 01:05.550
Jackie...

01:05.590 --> 01:07.797
Okay, then.

01:07.830 --> 01:09.161
Bye.

01:13.700 --> 01:15.861
There she is.

01:15.900 --> 01:18.300
Alicia, Marne Compton.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.369
Bowdoin, 2005.
Summa cum laude.

01:21.410 --> 01:23.275
She worked for
three years

01:23.310 --> 01:24.504
at Kaplan & Cohick?

01:24.550 --> 01:26.313
Personal assistant
to Mr. Cohick.

01:26.350 --> 01:27.248
Oh. Why'd you leave?

01:27.280 --> 01:28.474
There was an opportunity

01:28.520 --> 01:29.748
with Habitat for Humanity

01:29.790 --> 01:31.314
building an orphanage
in Tijuana.

01:31.350 --> 01:33.352
Peace Corps. Belize.

01:33.390 --> 01:35.153
Oh.

01:35.190 --> 01:37.681
(Cary and Marne laugh)

01:37.730 --> 01:41.393
And you know we only have money
for one assistant, Marne,

01:41.430 --> 01:43.193
so we would have
to share you.

01:43.230 --> 01:44.128
Oh, yes. Don't worry.

01:44.170 --> 01:45.319
I'm used to high-pressured
environments.

01:45.370 --> 01:47.133
I like action.

01:47.170 --> 01:48.159
To me, it's all about
time management.

01:48.200 --> 01:50.566
I know you're juggling three
or four cases at once,

01:50.610 --> 01:51.907
and it's my job
to help catch any balls

01:51.940 --> 01:53.237
that get dropped.

01:54.180 --> 01:56.148
I love your boots.

01:56.180 --> 01:57.875
Where did you
get them?
Oh, why thank you.

01:57.910 --> 01:59.616
I got them at Saks Fifth Avenue.

01:59.650 --> 02:02.380
They have a sale now, and
you can't believe the options.

02:02.420 --> 02:03.682
Isn't she great?

02:03.720 --> 02:04.880
Oh, yes.

02:04.920 --> 02:06.456
So, should I make it happen?

02:06.490 --> 02:08.617
Well, actually, let's
bring in a few more people.

02:08.660 --> 02:09.752
I'll make some calls.

02:09.790 --> 02:12.623
Sure, but we should do this
like voir dire or something.

02:12.660 --> 02:14.150
Three peremptory
challenges, you know.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.225
Hey, did you hear
about the rumors?

02:16.270 --> 02:17.919
Stern is retiring.
Our Stern?

02:17.970 --> 02:19.528
Yeah. We'll just be
Lockhart, Gardner.

02:19.570 --> 02:21.538
I saw this happen
at my dad's firm--

02:21.570 --> 02:22.707
two partners
losing a third.

02:22.740 --> 02:24.332
It was like
Dawn of the Dead.

02:24.370 --> 02:25.337
People fighting over turf.

02:25.370 --> 02:27.179
Junior associates lining up
against each other.

02:27.210 --> 02:29.246
Not us?
Oh, hey, I won't
if you won't.

02:29.280 --> 02:30.838
We have such a good
working relationship.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.643
Wow. They're still

02:32.680 --> 02:33.817
on the Lakeshore crash?

02:33.850 --> 02:35.215
Ithought
we settled that already.

02:37.790 --> 02:40.179
WOMAN:
That is our train.

02:40.220 --> 02:43.223
It crashed.
Your clients crashed it.

02:43.260 --> 02:44.488
Do I need to use

02:44.530 --> 02:46.191
simpler sentences?
Yes,
Patti.

02:46.230 --> 02:47.697
Please. I love_ it
when you patronize me.

02:47.730 --> 02:51.860
Cross National Freight entrusted
your clients to drive our train.

02:51.900 --> 02:52.889
They drove it too fast.

02:52.940 --> 02:55.363
They derailed it,
causing millions in damage.

02:55.400 --> 02:57.868
Luckily, it was a freight train
and nobody died.

02:57.910 --> 02:59.969
Except our clients.

03:00.010 --> 03:02.240
We should be suing you,
and not you us.

03:02.280 --> 03:04.339
Except for this nagging
little problem, Patti.

03:04.380 --> 03:06.371
That your company overworked
my clients

03:06.420 --> 03:08.445
with double-digit shifts

03:08.480 --> 03:10.311
and 18-hour days.

03:10.350 --> 03:12.409
Oh, yes,
the sexy overtime evidence.

03:12.460 --> 03:13.779
Juries love that.

03:13.820 --> 03:15.959
Except for the fact
that my clients are heroes.

03:15.990 --> 03:17.651
Except...
(Diane laughing)

03:19.500 --> 03:20.228
Yes?

03:20.260 --> 03:21.727
Except for the fact

03:21.760 --> 03:22.988
that these three men

03:23.030 --> 03:24.622
stayed with your train

03:24.670 --> 03:27.639
to keep it from crashing
into a residential neighborhood,

03:27.670 --> 03:29.467
saving untold lives.
Untold.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.636
I love untold.

03:30.670 --> 03:31.807
My bet is a jury

03:31.840 --> 03:33.330
will, too.
(laughing)
Will.

03:33.380 --> 03:35.439
We're not picking a jury
tomorrow.

03:35.480 --> 03:38.244
Judge Parks is a
pro-business constructionist

03:38.280 --> 03:40.817
who detests nuisance lawsuits
as much as I do.

03:40.850 --> 03:43.944
He's going to grant my motion
to dismiss, and you know it.

03:43.990 --> 03:45.582
And I know you know it.

03:45.620 --> 03:46.882
So what do you want?

03:46.920 --> 03:48.911
Make me an offer.

03:50.730 --> 03:51.879
Damn it, Alicia, I thought

03:51.930 --> 03:53.249
I said 3:00.
I'm sorry.

03:53.300 --> 03:54.995
I love watching you, Will.

03:55.030 --> 03:56.895
It's like Shakespeare
in the Park.

03:56.930 --> 03:58.522
WILL: This is awkward.
I tried to keep it

03:58.570 --> 04:01.266
so that you wouldn't
cross paths with the widows.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.836
PA'I'I_'I:
Heartstrlngs--
ouch, ouch--

04:02.870 --> 04:03.837
being tugged.

04:03.870 --> 04:04.939
What time is

04:04.970 --> 04:06.039
their 60 Minutes interview?

04:06.070 --> 04:08.732
5:00.

04:08.780 --> 04:10.600
We may not
need a jury.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.012
But, hey, what do I know?

04:14.050 --> 04:16.348
It's just 60 Minutes.

04:16.390 --> 04:19.018
We know how much they love
high-powered executives

04:19.050 --> 04:21.757
and hate grieving
widows, right?

04:21.790 --> 04:23.929
PATTI:
Mr. Harkin,

04:23.960 --> 04:25.757
I'm putting
you on speaker.

04:25.790 --> 04:27.724
HARKIN:
Uh, yeah, fine.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.796
Even though it is

04:29.830 --> 04:31.991
my belief
that we would win a countersuit

04:32.030 --> 04:33.190
against your clients
for negligence,

04:33.240 --> 04:36.607
we are willing to pay out
their pensions for ten years.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.039
WILL:
Ten?! You kidding?

04:38.070 --> 04:39.606
Does it come
with double coupons?

04:39.640 --> 04:42.029
Are you comfortable
with that, Mr. Harkin?

04:42.080 --> 04:43.570
No. 80 cents on the dollar.

04:43.610 --> 04:44.747
You know, sir, these widows

04:44.780 --> 04:46.338
are having trouble
paying their rent.

04:46.380 --> 04:47.210
HARKIN:
What?!

04:47.250 --> 04:49.514
One of them is about
to lose their house.

04:49.550 --> 04:51.438
She has three
children.
HARKIN:
What? Who IS that?

04:51.490 --> 04:52.980
(quietly):
I'll get him up to a dollar.

04:53.020 --> 04:55.386
You get them to agree.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.355
Ooh, I have yoga
in half an hour.

04:58.390 --> 05:00.790
After that, this deal is dead.

05:00.830 --> 05:02.593
Their pension
for ten years?

05:02.630 --> 05:04.097
It's a come-out offer.

05:04.130 --> 05:05.427
Anything?

05:05.470 --> 05:06.596
Pension for ten years.

05:06.640 --> 05:08.335
How much do we
have in this?

05:08.370 --> 05:09.667
Partner hours? 82.

05:09.710 --> 05:10.904
Will they take it?

05:10.940 --> 05:12.532
I don't know.
I don't think so.

05:12.580 --> 05:13.706
We're bleeding here.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.435
Hey, what was that all about?

05:15.480 --> 05:16.799
With Overby?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.408
Oh, Malcolm?
You know him?
Mm-hmm.

05:18.450 --> 05:20.418
He's an old friend.
Just catching up.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.411
So, uh, don't take
a lot of time with it.

05:24.450 --> 05:26.759
Just do a basic
background check.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.712
Malcolm's
an old friend.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.489
What am I looking for?

05:33.160 --> 05:35.424
Stability.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.121
Kalinda, one last thing.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.092
I need you
to keep this confidential.

05:39.130 --> 05:42.031
I'll be splitting time
with Cross National Freight.

05:42.070 --> 05:43.731
I'm not sure that's possible.

05:43.770 --> 05:44.759
Well, if Will asks,

05:44.810 --> 05:47.438
just say I'm having you do work
on Sheffrin-Marks.

05:53.550 --> 05:55.142
I want an apology.

05:55.180 --> 05:58.889
They worked my...
our husbands to death.

05:58.920 --> 06:01.514
They tried to blame them for
this accident, and now they want

06:01.560 --> 06:03.425
to pay ten years
on their pensions?

06:03.460 --> 06:04.620
I'm sorry, Mrs. Underwood.

06:04.660 --> 06:06.127
I don't want you
to apologize.

06:06.160 --> 06:07.457
I want them to apologize.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.626
They don't

06:08.660 --> 06:10.719
apologize.
Money is their apology.

06:10.770 --> 06:13.159
Well, I guess then
they must not be very sorry.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.861
I think we
should take it.

06:16.170 --> 06:17.706
H... I need
the money.

06:17.740 --> 06:20.072
I'm a month away from
sleeping in my car.

06:20.110 --> 06:24.149
My kids-- they still cry
for their dad at night.

06:24.180 --> 06:25.647
Look at these
bills. I...

06:25.680 --> 06:27.477
They're not even
paying John's overtime.

06:27.520 --> 06:29.715
Because they want to starve us
into a settlement.

06:29.750 --> 06:31.945
Let me talk
to her again, see what

06:31.990 --> 06:33.514
they come back with.

06:33.560 --> 06:37.826
But I think we all know
we're in the endgame here.

06:37.860 --> 06:39.521
So, you've lost faith?

06:39.560 --> 06:43.166
I believe Cross National Freight
overworked your husbands

06:43.200 --> 06:45.418
to the point of exhaustion.

06:45.470 --> 06:47.062
I believe that's why
the train crashed,

06:47.100 --> 06:48.067
but I can't prove it.

06:48.100 --> 06:52.161
And they can prove
the train was moving too fast.

07:00.650 --> 07:02.538
I'm sorry, Linda.

07:05.520 --> 07:07.511
So, you still want these,

07:07.560 --> 07:08.754
denial of
overtime claims?

07:08.790 --> 07:10.155
Yes. Everything you have.

07:10.190 --> 07:12.829
We're trying
to build to a...

07:12.860 --> 07:14.657
What?

07:16.770 --> 07:18.988
Would you just give me a moment?

07:28.040 --> 07:30.008
Alicia,

07:30.050 --> 07:32.746
this offer is walking out
the door in ten minutes.

07:32.780 --> 07:37.581
What?

07:37.620 --> 07:39.212
This is the memo
in our discovery.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.683
Mm-hmm.

07:40.720 --> 07:43.086
This is the same memo
sent to our clients.

07:43.130 --> 07:46.657
They left off three names.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.521
You can go to yoga now.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.561
We'll see you in court.

07:53.770 --> 07:55.897
WILL:
The bottom line is

07:55.940 --> 07:58.500
Cross National Freight
deliberately denied us discovery

07:58.540 --> 08:00.804
by concealing Mr. Merriman
and two other department heads.

08:00.840 --> 08:03.570
Your Honor, no one has been
denied discovery here.

08:03.610 --> 08:06.147
If names were left off
documents, it was inadvertent.

08:06.180 --> 08:08.569
Inadvertent? Is that what
they're calling Wite-Out

08:08.620 --> 08:09.746
these days?

08:09.790 --> 08:11.587
Your Honor, that is just...

08:11.620 --> 08:12.917
Aah.

08:15.260 --> 08:16.215
I'm sorry, but

08:16.260 --> 08:17.579
Iﬁnd
Mr. Gardener's charges

08:17.630 --> 08:18.722
personally offensive.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.159
Mr. Merriman and
these other two people

08:20.200 --> 08:21.690
have nothing to
do with overtime.

08:21.730 --> 08:23.960
Then why were they CC'd
on a letter denying it?

08:24.000 --> 08:25.297
(Parks clearing throat)

08:25.330 --> 08:26.592
Mr. Gardner, you don't have

08:26.640 --> 08:27.390
enough here to convince a jury.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.567
Your Honor,
with all due respect...

08:29.610 --> 08:31.134
Don't all due respect me,
Counselor.

08:31.170 --> 08:32.979
I'm not your high school
gym teacher.

08:33.010 --> 08:34.307
On the other
hand, Ms. Nyholm--

08:34.340 --> 08:36.274
inadvertent, my ass.

08:36.310 --> 08:37.208
Mr. Gardner, how long

08:37.250 --> 08:39.275
would it take
to depose these Witnesses?

08:39.310 --> 08:42.017
To properly prepare and depose,
I would say one month.

08:42.050 --> 08:42.812
You have three days.

08:42.850 --> 08:43.817
Three?

08:43.850 --> 08:44.987
But, Your Honor,
that isn't...

08:45.020 --> 08:46.214
Now you have two days.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.558
Want to try for one?

08:47.590 --> 08:48.659
No, thank you, Your Honor.

08:48.690 --> 08:50.624
PATTI:
Your Honor, ifI could
just interject here.

08:50.660 --> 08:52.651
These executives
are very busy people.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.759
Even two hours
out of their work day...

08:54.800 --> 08:57.018
Ms. Nyholm, you just gave
Mr. Gardner back his third day.

08:57.070 --> 08:58.697
Would you like
to give him a fourth?

08:58.730 --> 09:00.869
No, Your Honor.
I'll stop.
Good.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.606
We'll meet back here on Friday

09:02.640 --> 09:04.608
to decide
whether a dismissal is in order.

09:04.640 --> 09:06.528
Does anybody have anything
to say?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.268
Okay.

09:09.310 --> 09:10.208
Next case.

09:10.250 --> 09:12.343
(gavelbangs)
BAILIFF:
Next on docket...

09:12.380 --> 09:13.472
Cancel everything.

09:13.520 --> 09:17.047
For the next 72 hours, we eat,
drink and sleep this case.

09:17.090 --> 09:21.083
Captioning sponsored by
CBS TELEVISION

09:32.700 --> 09:34.338
JACKIE: I wanted to bring you
a birthday cake.

09:34.370 --> 09:36.804
(both laughing)

09:36.840 --> 09:38.808
How's everything
at home, Mom?

09:38.840 --> 09:40.068
Good.

09:40.110 --> 09:42.670
She's working too much,
but that's about it.

09:42.710 --> 09:44.200
Alicia?
Mm-hmm.

09:44.250 --> 09:45.239
What did I say?

09:45.280 --> 09:48.340
Every time you refer to
Alicia, you say "she."

09:48.380 --> 09:51.611
Do I?
Mm-hmm.

09:51.650 --> 09:54.687
Alicia came home
last night at midnight,

09:54.720 --> 09:57.280
left this morning at 6:00.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.924
I warned her about
Diane Lockhart.

09:59.960 --> 10:01.996
No, no, it's the other one,
Will Gardner.

10:02.030 --> 10:04.624
I mean, I'm glad
they're friends and all,

10:04.670 --> 10:06.729
but he needs
to give her a break.

10:06.770 --> 10:08.590
Day and night, she never stops.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.264
Okay, so the goal is this.

10:12.310 --> 10:13.629
I'll depose Merriman.

10:13.680 --> 10:14.578
He's the VP of Operations.

10:14.610 --> 10:16.669
That's who I think
Patti's hiding from us.

10:16.710 --> 10:18.348
The other two--
what are their names?

10:18.380 --> 10:19.472
Jonathan Eldredge
and Sarah Conley.

10:19.510 --> 10:21.910
He's a systems engineer, and
she's in industry relations.

10:21.950 --> 10:24.111
Okay, whatever you do,
just keep the depos going.

10:24.150 --> 10:25.082
Just keep asking questions

10:25.120 --> 10:27.384
so Judge Parks doesn't pull
the plug on this.

10:27.420 --> 10:28.978
Hopefully, I draw enough blood
with Merriman,

10:29.020 --> 10:29.952
they'll up their offer.

10:29.990 --> 10:32.254
Remember, the point isn't
to go back to court.

10:32.290 --> 10:34.793
The point is to get them
to open their wallets further.

10:34.830 --> 10:36.422
ALICIA: And you're a mechanical
systems manager.

10:36.460 --> 10:38.223
Is that correct,
Mr. Eldredge?
Yes.

10:38.270 --> 10:39.191
And this says

10:39.230 --> 10:41.698
that you ordered
a new public-address system

10:41.740 --> 10:42.707
for passenger cars.

10:42.740 --> 10:44.002
Could you explain?

10:44.040 --> 10:45.837
Standard upgrade.
And this says

10:45.870 --> 10:48.202
you authorized a new
coupling mechanism.

10:48.240 --> 10:50.344
Is that right?
Yes. Standard
upgrade.

10:50.380 --> 10:52.200
And this says-- let's see--

10:52.250 --> 10:55.048
that you replaced
the automated LRS,

10:55.080 --> 10:56.945
"Load Regulator System."

10:56.990 --> 10:58.412
Standard upgrade.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.884
Your rail traffic has doubled in

11:00.920 --> 11:03.229
the last decade, but you've cut
your crews in half, correct?

11:03.260 --> 11:04.386
There's more
automated equipment.

11:04.430 --> 11:05.658
Trains are easier to drive.

11:05.690 --> 11:08.124
And yet it still takes the same
amount of time to drive them.

11:08.160 --> 11:09.798
Let the record
reflect

11:09.830 --> 11:10.660
that Mr. Merriman shrugged.

11:10.700 --> 11:13.794
Let the record reflect,
I shrugged, too.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.467
So, Ms. Conley, you're saying
you have nothing to do

11:15.500 --> 11:17.707
with approving
or denying overtime?

11:17.740 --> 11:19.037
That's right.
And what about
David Merriman?

11:19.070 --> 11:21.231
Has he ever approved
or denied overtime?

11:21.280 --> 11:22.235
I don't recall.

11:22.280 --> 11:24.248
Did any of the accident victims
work overtime

11:24.280 --> 11:25.747
the week before
the Lakeshore crash?

11:25.780 --> 11:26.940
I don't recall.
Did any

11:26.980 --> 11:28.811
of them routinely
put in for overtime?

11:28.850 --> 11:30.784
I don't recall. _
Ms. Conley, are you married?

11:30.820 --> 11:31.718
I don't re...

11:32.820 --> 11:35.789
Oh, I'm so sorry, Ms. Conley.

11:35.820 --> 11:37.788
I've got three clients
who lost their husbands--

11:37.830 --> 11:39.286
must have been a Freudian slip.

11:39.330 --> 11:41.355
The truth is,

11:41.400 --> 11:45.029
these three employees had gone
24 hours without rest

11:45.070 --> 11:46.196
when this accident
occurred.

11:46.230 --> 11:48.334
No, no, they work hard,
sure, but...

11:48.370 --> 11:49.462
You worked them hard,
didn't you?

11:49.500 --> 11:51.331
I did my job, Mr. Gardner.

11:51.370 --> 11:54.134
And what was your job,
Mr. Merriman? Tell us.

11:54.180 --> 11:56.239
We pay these people well--
we expect results.

11:56.280 --> 11:58.407
You're a lavwer, you work people
hard here at your firm?

11:58.450 --> 12:00.771
You bet your ass you do.
This is America.

12:00.820 --> 12:03.243
You work hard, get the job done,
whatever it takes.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.848
I think we should
take a break.

12:04.890 --> 12:07.313
Definitely.

12:07.360 --> 12:09.988
Let Mr. Merriman
recompose himself.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.794
This guy is a
walking disaster.

12:12.830 --> 12:14.821
No wonder they
hid him from us.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.020
You should've seen Patti.

12:16.060 --> 12:18.062
She looked like she was ready
to give birth right there.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.522
(chuckles)
How'd yours go?

12:19.570 --> 12:20.491
Well,

12:20.540 --> 12:23.304
I know more about trains
than I ever wanted.

12:23.340 --> 12:24.409
Just keep it going.

12:24.440 --> 12:25.464
Patti's on the phone
with her overlords

12:25.510 --> 12:26.499
trying to up the offer.

12:26.540 --> 12:27.472
If she does, can you get
the widows on the line?

12:27.510 --> 12:29.068
Yeah, Linda said she'd stay
by the phone.

12:29.110 --> 12:30.407
Thanks. You kept
them together.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.769
I know that hasn't easy.

12:31.810 --> 12:33.368
Oh, I didn't do anything.

12:38.050 --> 12:40.848
You can just tell us the number,
Patti.

12:40.890 --> 12:43.779
Have you ever known a fishing
expedition to be free, Will?

12:43.830 --> 12:45.786
Three more days
for discovery--

12:45.830 --> 12:47.821
that went both ways.
Oh, come on.

12:47.860 --> 12:49.896
Our clients passed
every company drug test...

12:49.930 --> 12:51.522
Yes, but this wasn't
the company's.

12:51.570 --> 12:53.333
This was part of Underwood's
application

12:53.370 --> 12:55.895
to renew his health insurance,
a week before the crash.

12:55.940 --> 12:57.532
Amphetamines?
That's right.

12:57.570 --> 13:00.175
Your client was on speed.

13:00.210 --> 13:02.269
When I was

13:02.310 --> 13:04.039
first starting out, I, uh,

13:04.080 --> 13:05.547
I got a terrific
piece of advice,

13:05.580 --> 13:07.878
and it's always stuck
with me and this is it:

13:07.920 --> 13:10.047
Everything that happens
in a courtroom...

13:10.090 --> 13:12.046
Who did you say he was again?

13:12.090 --> 13:13.387
Malcolm Overby.

13:13.420 --> 13:15.183
Oh.

13:15.220 --> 13:17.222
Yeah, I think I've heard of him.

13:17.260 --> 13:18.818
Back in the time
of Clarence Darrow,

13:18.860 --> 13:20.555
it was a common practice
for people

13:20.600 --> 13:22.556
to smoke in the courtroom.
So, do you work with him?

13:22.600 --> 13:24.568
Currently.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.239
Rumor is he might be
going to another firm.

13:27.270 --> 13:29.238
I just hope he
takes me with him.

13:29.270 --> 13:30.567
...Cuban cigar
and he starts smoking...

13:30.610 --> 13:32.566
(phone buzzing)

13:32.610 --> 13:33.929
Sorry.

13:33.980 --> 13:35.231
Would you excuse me?

13:35.280 --> 13:36.406
It's my mother.

13:36.440 --> 13:38.044
I'll be right back.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.071
(Overby continues talking)

13:40.120 --> 13:42.145
Cross National
What's up?

13:42.180 --> 13:44.080
is throwing an insurance drug
test at us for Underwood.

13:44.120 --> 13:45.314
Could you check it out?

13:45.350 --> 13:47.250
Sure, but tomorrow.

13:47.290 --> 13:48.882
Uh, what? Why? What's up?

13:49.930 --> 13:52.057
Diane's asked me
to do further work

13:52.090 --> 13:55.059
on Sheffrin-Marks.

13:55.100 --> 13:56.294
She what?

13:56.330 --> 13:58.264
(laughter and applause)

13:58.300 --> 14:00.291
I've gotta go.

14:03.140 --> 14:06.007
I can tell from your
face, it's not good.

14:09.040 --> 14:12.271
The company
has a drug test.

14:12.310 --> 14:15.074
It says Jimmy had amphetamines
in his system.

14:17.420 --> 14:20.412
(train whistle blows
in distance)

14:20.460 --> 14:22.985
For the longest time

14:23.030 --> 14:24.622
I didn't think
there was evil.

14:24.660 --> 14:26.924
I just thought
there were people

14:26.960 --> 14:28.552
who did good and
bad things.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.592
But now...

14:35.540 --> 14:37.007
(sighs)

14:37.040 --> 14:38.200
Sorry.

14:40.010 --> 14:42.308
That's the kind of conversation
Jimmy and I would have.

14:42.340 --> 14:44.649
Linda, I have to ask,

14:44.680 --> 14:46.602
did you know about this?

14:46.650 --> 14:48.447
Alicia,

14:48.480 --> 14:51.449
Jimmy never did drugs.

14:51.490 --> 14:54.982
There's nothing to know about.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.282
Go through your medicine
cabinet.

14:56.320 --> 14:58.288
Bring me every pill
Jimmy's ever taken,

14:58.330 --> 14:59.991
every pill he could've
accidentally taken of yours.

15:00.030 --> 15:01.190
Could you do that?

15:05.600 --> 15:07.591
Are we gonna win?

15:07.640 --> 15:10.029
We're gonna fight.

15:13.010 --> 15:15.638
ALICIA:
Cole v. Wolensky.

15:15.680 --> 15:17.648
"Judge may exclude drug test

15:17.680 --> 15:19.307
"if there's been a violation

15:19.350 --> 15:21.318
of testing
procedure."

15:21.350 --> 15:23.318
Judge Parks would rather
eat his own foot

15:23.350 --> 15:25.181
than offer us relief on that.

15:25.220 --> 15:26.209
Kalinda have any leads?

15:26.250 --> 15:27.683
I...

15:27.720 --> 15:29.085
No.

15:29.120 --> 15:30.451
She's doing something
with Diane.

15:30.490 --> 15:32.026
For Diane? What?

15:33.060 --> 15:35.153
Something for Sheffrin-Marks.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.168
(sighs)

15:39.200 --> 15:41.395
What?

15:41.440 --> 15:43.408
We've got a power vacuum here.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.408
It makes people do...

15:45.440 --> 15:47.169
interesting things.

15:48.280 --> 15:52.239
Did she say anything
about Malcolm Overby?

15:52.280 --> 15:53.941
No.

15:55.780 --> 15:59.284
Well, I'm giving up
on law aanay.

15:59.320 --> 16:01.311
I'm sick of it.

16:01.360 --> 16:02.987
Back to the minors?

16:03.030 --> 16:04.725
(chuckles)

16:06.630 --> 16:08.621
I could've been a contender.

16:08.660 --> 16:11.390
I liked watching you pitch.

16:12.430 --> 16:14.432
Yeah, I had some moments.

16:19.810 --> 16:22.005
We're the last
ones here.

16:22.040 --> 16:24.577
Yep.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.281
I should go.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.288
Yeah.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.015
Me, too.

16:38.060 --> 16:39.755
(phone rings)

16:39.790 --> 16:41.496
Yeah?

16:41.530 --> 16:42.792
MAN:
Yeah, Mr. Gardener.
There's a woman down here

16:42.830 --> 16:44.593
who insists on seeing
Mrs. Florrick.

16:45.600 --> 16:46.567
(elevator bell dings)

16:46.600 --> 16:48.397
Oh, Ms. Conley,

16:48.440 --> 16:49.589
did you forget
something?

16:49.640 --> 16:50.629
I'm not here.

16:52.510 --> 16:54.398
I have a family.
I can't get messed up in this.

16:54.440 --> 16:56.305
Okay. Let's talk.

16:56.340 --> 16:57.648
No.

16:57.680 --> 16:59.648
It's wrong what they're doing.

16:59.680 --> 17:00.772
Blaming them
with that drug test.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.344
Blaming them for something
they".

17:02.380 --> 17:03.711
Something they...?

17:03.750 --> 17:05.741
(elevator buzzing)

17:07.220 --> 17:09.211
Newbury Heights.

17:09.260 --> 17:09.783
Wait. What?

17:09.820 --> 17:11.526
Newbury Heights.

17:11.560 --> 17:13.198
I don't know what
you mean.
Find out.

17:23.810 --> 17:26.631
What's that? What's that?
(toy rattling)

17:26.670 --> 17:28.103
Is that
your toy?

17:28.140 --> 17:30.370
What is that?
Is that your toy?

17:30.410 --> 17:31.547
Is that what it is?

17:31.580 --> 17:33.571
How old?

17:34.680 --> 17:36.671
Oh, I'm so stupid.

17:36.720 --> 17:37.812
(baby cooing)

17:37.850 --> 17:39.249
I should've
just shut up.

17:39.290 --> 17:41.087
I should've just
kept walking.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.486
But that would've been wrong.

17:43.530 --> 17:46.090
I thought you'd be different.

17:46.130 --> 17:48.121
I thought after
what you went through...

17:48.160 --> 17:50.128
with your family...

17:50.170 --> 17:52.263
And you come here
to my house?

17:52.300 --> 17:53.790
I'm sorry.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.637
Then go.
I can't.

17:55.670 --> 17:59.106
There are three mothers who are
Widows now, Mrs. Conley...

17:59.140 --> 18:00.129
It's not my fault.

18:00.180 --> 18:02.239
But it's somebody's fault.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.302
What do you want?

18:04.350 --> 18:06.306
I looked into Newbury Heights.

18:06.350 --> 18:07.647
I couldn't find anything.

18:07.680 --> 18:09.477
I went back 50 years.

18:09.520 --> 18:11.249
There's never been
an aCCIdent there.

18:16.260 --> 18:18.228
It wasn't an accident.

18:18.260 --> 18:21.229
It was a near miss.

18:21.260 --> 18:23.262
And it wasn't one of our trains.

18:24.430 --> 18:27.263
MAN:
Right. Phew.

18:27.300 --> 18:30.736
Coming into Newbury Heights,
there's a nine degree curve.

18:30.770 --> 18:32.567
That's where
we jumped the track.

18:32.610 --> 18:33.872
Just managed
to get the brake on

18:33.910 --> 18:35.878
before we hit
the commuter train.

18:35.910 --> 18:38.344
Did anyone from your company
ever identify the problem?

18:38.380 --> 18:39.847
Sure. Sure.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.313
They identified me.

18:41.350 --> 18:42.874
Said I was
going too fast.

18:42.920 --> 18:45.639
But the speed gauge
never went above 32 mph.

18:45.690 --> 18:47.317
I thought it was
mechanical.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.918
Maybe a faulty
pressure sensor.

18:48.960 --> 18:51.884
Isn't the pressure sensor part
of the load regulator sensor?

18:53.500 --> 18:54.922
Trains, you know.

18:54.960 --> 18:55.927
Love them.

18:55.960 --> 18:59.862
So, if you upgraded the LRS,

18:59.900 --> 19:02.733
wouldn't you have to replace
the pressure sensor, too?

19:02.770 --> 19:04.306
Yeah. Fact is,
that's what they did,

19:04.340 --> 19:07.332
after the near miss,
they upgraded the LRS.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.701
Standard upgrade.

19:09.740 --> 19:11.276
We've been going
after the wrong thing--

19:11.310 --> 19:13.870
overtime records
and not faulty equipment.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.911
They erased those memos
not to hide Merriman,

19:15.950 --> 19:17.918
but the structural engineer,
our buddy Eldredge.

19:17.950 --> 19:19.781
If we can prove
he was at Newbury Heights...

19:19.820 --> 19:21.583
Yep. Previous knowledge.
We'll have a case

19:21.620 --> 19:23.827
even Judge Parks can't
kick. Here's the deal:

19:23.860 --> 19:26.249
We can't let Patti know
we're changing strategies.

19:26.290 --> 19:27.723
I'll keep deposing
Merriman.

19:27.760 --> 19:28.897
You re-depose Eldredge.

19:28.930 --> 19:29.851
Be ready in
ten minutes.

19:29.900 --> 19:31.663
Okay.

19:31.700 --> 19:34.567
I think I have someone you'll
be more comfortable with.

19:34.600 --> 19:36.739
(raspy voice):
I worked 19 years
as an assistant.

19:36.770 --> 19:38.658
We called them secretaries
in my day.

19:38.710 --> 19:39.859
(coughs)

19:39.910 --> 19:41.400
And are you comfortable

19:41.440 --> 19:43.408
with online research,
Mrs. Plack?

19:43.450 --> 19:44.849
Online?

19:44.880 --> 19:46.871
Oh, yeah, everything's
computers nowadays.

19:46.910 --> 19:48.775
Don't worry,
I'm a quick study.

19:48.820 --> 19:50.287
Hey, I like your
hair this way.

19:50.320 --> 19:51.878
(coughs)
Yeah, I do.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.911
It looked so dowdy on TV,

19:53.960 --> 19:55.689
pulled back like that.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.358
But that must've been
a hard day, huh?

19:59.660 --> 20:02.299
What's the smoking
policy here, anyway?

20:02.330 --> 20:03.866
What? I thought you two
would have a lot in common.

20:03.900 --> 20:05.891
That does not count
as a preemptory.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.279
Oh, Mr. Merriman's
is upstairs.

20:13.310 --> 20:16.279
Yes, I thought I'd sit
in on this one today.

20:16.310 --> 20:19.279
Get to know
you better.

20:19.310 --> 20:20.868
Great.

20:20.920 --> 20:21.944
Please.

20:21.980 --> 20:24.016
Actually...

20:24.050 --> 20:25.813
chairs aren't really
my friends these days.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.215
I think I'll just stand.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.828
So you're Will's new one?

20:33.860 --> 20:36.727
Yes, I'm his _new
junior assoaate.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.569
Yeah, that's what I meant.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.636
The way he looks at you:
that's what I meant.

20:40.670 --> 20:44.037
I guess he finds
you a challenge.

20:44.070 --> 20:45.537
Too many blond gigglers,

20:45.570 --> 20:47.538
and why not go for someone
more substantial,

20:47.580 --> 20:49.377
someone with interesting
history.

20:49.410 --> 20:50.342
Mrs. Nyholm.

20:50.380 --> 20:52.348
I know how this works--

20:52.380 --> 20:54.519
we're going to try
and get into each other's heads,

20:54.550 --> 20:56.518
try and unnerve each other.

20:56.550 --> 20:58.484
Can I give you a little bit
of advice?

20:59.820 --> 21:04.359
After the past seven months,
I'm vaccinated.

21:05.030 --> 21:07.021
Fair enough.

21:08.500 --> 21:10.491
Let's get started.

21:10.530 --> 21:11.895
Mr. Eldredge, two months
before the Lakeshore crash,

21:11.930 --> 21:13.295
you authorized

21:13.340 --> 21:14.967
an upgrade
of the load regulator system

21:15.000 --> 21:16.831
on all Cross National
Freight trains.

21:16.870 --> 21:17.939
Can you explain why?

21:17.970 --> 21:20.768
_ There wasn't
just one reason.

21:20.810 --> 21:23.449
It was a change we'd
planned for some time.

21:23.480 --> 21:26.699
( The Twilight Zone
ringtone playing)

21:28.750 --> 21:31.583
And what about the LRS
in the train that crashed,

21:31.620 --> 21:32.609
did you replace that one?

21:32.650 --> 21:35.448
I don't believe we did.

21:35.490 --> 21:37.458
The-the upgrade
takes some time,

21:37.490 --> 21:38.889
and we couldn't_ have
all of our engines

21:38.930 --> 21:40.727
out of commission
at once.

21:40.760 --> 21:42.091
I understand that.

21:42.130 --> 21:43.563
Tell me about Newbury Heights,

21:43.600 --> 21:45.295
Mr. Eldredge?

21:46.600 --> 21:47.464
What?

21:48.900 --> 21:50.436
Tell me about it.

21:50.470 --> 21:52.461
It's, uh...

21:53.540 --> 21:55.531
I don't know what you mean.

21:55.580 --> 21:57.548
June 21,
you went to Newbury Heights

21:57.580 --> 21:59.901
to check out a near_miss
colli5ion, isn't that right?

22:00.980 --> 22:02.516
Would you like to take a break?

22:02.550 --> 22:04.984
If you were to learn
there was a problem

22:05.020 --> 22:06.783
with a piece of equipment
on your trains, Mr. Eldredge,

22:06.820 --> 22:08.014
you'd replace the part,
wouldn't you?

22:08.060 --> 22:10.483
Of course I would.
And you'd make sure that

22:10.530 --> 22:12.054
no trains were operating
with unsafe equipment?

22:12.090 --> 22:13.455
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.091
No, you don't.

22:14.130 --> 22:15.392
I never once...

22:15.430 --> 22:17.921
(Patti cries out)
Ooh. Ooh.

22:17.970 --> 22:19.028
My apologies.

22:19.070 --> 22:21.391
A... a pang.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.032
(exhaHng)

22:23.070 --> 22:24.662
We're gonna have
to break this off here.

22:24.710 --> 22:26.735
Oh, come on. Objection.

22:26.770 --> 22:28.135
Let the record reflect

22:28.180 --> 22:30.478
deposition was suspended
for medical reasons.

22:30.510 --> 22:32.375
And again, I-I apologize.

22:32.410 --> 22:33.104
Mr. Eldredge.

22:40.150 --> 22:41.458
Sorry.

22:42.090 --> 22:44.081
It's okay.

22:55.740 --> 22:57.628
Hi, Jackie. It's me.

22:57.670 --> 22:59.501
I saw that you called.

22:59.540 --> 23:02.179
(buzzing)

23:02.210 --> 23:05.407
MAN (over P.A.):
Please obey all commands
and follow instructions.

23:05.450 --> 23:07.839
(indistinct chattering)

23:07.880 --> 23:10.986
Please obey all commands
and follow instructions.

23:13.990 --> 23:15.150
Dad.

23:16.190 --> 23:17.726
Dad.

23:17.760 --> 23:19.079
Zach?

23:24.030 --> 23:25.122
It's you!

23:27.970 --> 23:30.461
I... I missed you.

23:30.510 --> 23:31.761
I know.

23:40.650 --> 23:42.140
Grace.

23:42.180 --> 23:44.114
Go to him.

23:44.150 --> 23:45.686
Grace.

23:45.720 --> 23:48.154
Happy Birthday, Dad.

23:51.690 --> 23:53.624
So, you still
a fish or what?

23:56.230 --> 23:58.664
Yep, still a fish.

23:58.700 --> 24:00.691
Just like in Oz.

24:00.740 --> 24:03.538
They do shakedowns
every day?

24:03.570 --> 24:05.834
Your Honor, Will Gardner.
This is my third message.

24:05.870 --> 24:07.235
_ Defense counsel's
interrupted dep05ition

24:07.270 --> 24:09.579
for the day and we...
(machine beeps)

24:09.610 --> 24:10.770
Damn it.

24:12.810 --> 24:14.038
He's lying.

24:15.580 --> 24:16.478
What?

24:16.520 --> 24:18.909
He knew exactly
what Newbury Heights was.

24:18.950 --> 24:20.781
He said he was
in the office all day.

24:20.820 --> 24:22.219
But you have to swipe that

24:22.260 --> 24:23.625
every time you
exit and enter.

24:23.660 --> 24:24.820
Which means we
can tell exactly

24:24.860 --> 24:27.852
what time he came and went.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.595
I can't get the
judge on the phone,

24:29.630 --> 24:31.518
but if I hurry,
I'll catch him.

24:31.570 --> 24:32.992
What are you doing?
Getting a court order

24:33.030 --> 24:35.533
_for Cross National
Freight's security records.

24:35.570 --> 24:37.629
Find Kalinda, tell her to
meet me down at the courthouse.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.754
(horn honking)

25:06.900 --> 25:08.060
Hello.

25:08.100 --> 25:11.558
(Overby talking quietly)

25:13.240 --> 25:14.605
(camera shutter clicking)

25:19.280 --> 25:21.578
Oh, listen,
I'll call you about that...

25:53.980 --> 25:56.119
What's the occasion?

25:56.150 --> 25:57.219
Work.

25:57.250 --> 25:59.639
It's just so pretty.

25:59.690 --> 26:01.351
Thank you.

26:01.390 --> 26:02.857
What time did you get in?

26:02.890 --> 26:04.152
Late. You were asleep.

26:04.190 --> 26:05.225
Thanks, by the way.

26:05.260 --> 26:07.057
This should be the last
late night for a while.

26:07.090 --> 26:09.957
I took Grace and Zach
to see Peter.

26:15.670 --> 26:17.331
You did what?

26:17.370 --> 26:21.101
I took Grace and Zach to see
their father for his birthday.

26:21.140 --> 26:24.007
Jackie, I-I...

26:24.050 --> 26:25.301
I-I'm thunderstruck.

26:25.350 --> 26:27.272
I tried to phone you.

26:27.310 --> 26:29.278
You tried to phone me?

26:29.320 --> 26:31.788
We discussed this.

26:31.820 --> 26:33.014
I was taking them next week.

26:33.050 --> 26:34.984
It worked out perfectly,
seeing him.

26:35.020 --> 26:36.715
They were perfect.

26:36.760 --> 26:37.886
Jackie.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.182
I am their mother.

26:40.230 --> 26:42.653
It is my decision.

26:42.700 --> 26:46.261
This of all things
is m decision!

26:46.300 --> 26:48.165
I'm sorry.
It was spontaneous.

26:48.200 --> 26:51.328
You don't supervise
my kids spontaneously.

26:51.370 --> 26:53.702
You don't take them
to prison.

26:53.740 --> 26:56.208
You don't just try and phone me.
You phone me.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.640
You respect me as a mother
or you leave.

26:59.680 --> 27:01.841
I am doing the best I can.

27:01.880 --> 27:05.316
Well, join the club.

27:08.390 --> 27:13.282
Overby's firm is
well capitalized,

27:13.330 --> 27:15.696
excellent client base,

27:15.730 --> 27:16.799
no ethics charges,

27:16.830 --> 27:18.923
no bankruptcies,
no judgments.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.768
But are you sure
that's what you're looking for?

27:21.800 --> 27:23.233
I... don't know.

27:23.270 --> 27:24.862
Should I be looking
for something else?

27:24.910 --> 27:26.366
Well, that's like
asking a dentist

27:26.410 --> 27:28.139
whether you should brush.

27:29.740 --> 27:31.674
See what you can find out.

27:31.710 --> 27:33.371
And, Kalinda, again,
this is just between you and me.

27:33.410 --> 27:34.342
You understand?

27:34.380 --> 27:37.315
Yeah.

27:41.390 --> 27:43.984
Do you know how much
you pay jury consultants?

27:44.030 --> 27:45.349
No.

27:45.390 --> 27:47.893
$100,000 for three months work.

27:47.930 --> 27:49.397
That sounds about right.

27:49.430 --> 27:51.728
Do you know how much I make?

27:51.770 --> 27:53.738
I have a feeling
I'm finding out.

27:53.770 --> 27:54.896
A fourth of that.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.692
That sounds outrageous.

27:56.740 --> 27:59.208
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

28:07.010 --> 28:09.478
Subpoenaed records
of security entrances

28:09.520 --> 28:11.408
from May to August.
Thanks.

28:11.450 --> 28:12.917
So, Kalinda, can I ask you...

28:12.950 --> 28:14.258
Hmm?

28:14.290 --> 28:15.314
This thing
you're doing with Diane,

28:15.360 --> 28:17.419
does it have anything
to do with Malcolm Overby?

28:17.460 --> 28:19.121
No.

28:19.160 --> 28:20.388
It doesn't?

28:20.430 --> 28:22.125
No, you can't ask me.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.720
It's just...

28:24.770 --> 28:27.091
If he's coming on as a third
partner, Will should know.

28:27.130 --> 28:30.964
You can't ask me
and I can't tell you

28:31.010 --> 28:33.467
but don't conclude
from what I'm saying
it's what you think.

28:33.510 --> 28:35.478
Okay.

28:38.180 --> 28:40.876
Can you be any more specific?

28:40.920 --> 28:42.808
No.

28:50.120 --> 28:51.826
Wait, here's the
date, June 21.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.327
It would take him
about two hours

28:53.360 --> 28:55.419
to get out
to Newbury Heights.

28:55.460 --> 28:57.257
He leaves the
office at 6:42 pm,

28:57.300 --> 28:59.188
and he comes back...

28:59.230 --> 29:01.369
An hour later.
That's not enough time.

29:01.400 --> 29:02.890
What about the next day?

29:05.140 --> 29:06.334
Same thing.

29:06.370 --> 29:08.008
9:48 p.m.,

29:08.040 --> 29:10.474
comes back at 10:33 pm.

29:10.510 --> 29:12.444
Wait.

29:12.480 --> 29:13.970
That's someone else.

29:14.020 --> 29:16.818
Oh, you're right.
That's Sarah Conley.

29:16.850 --> 29:18.340
Oh, here he is.

29:18.390 --> 29:19.539
Eldredge...

29:19.590 --> 29:22.013
he left and came back
a few minutes later.

29:22.060 --> 29:24.551
That's interesting.

29:24.590 --> 29:26.558
VVhat?
Look.

29:26.590 --> 29:28.319
See, here it is again.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.191
Sarah Conley leaves within
a few minutes of Eldredge,

29:30.230 --> 29:33.222
she _comes back _
a few minutes after him.

29:33.270 --> 29:37.900
Same here, 9:30 pm.

29:37.940 --> 29:39.805
Me, too...

29:39.840 --> 29:41.808
8:45 pm.

29:41.840 --> 29:43.876
And on August 5, the night
of the Lakeshore crash,

29:43.910 --> 29:45.548
same thing.

29:45.580 --> 29:47.969
They're always the last two
working together at night.

29:48.020 --> 29:49.476
Yeah, well, so are we.

29:49.520 --> 29:52.239
Yeah, but they're
leaving and returning

29:52.290 --> 29:55.054
within a few minutes
of each other on foot.

29:55.090 --> 29:57.479
And you know what's across
from their building?

29:57.520 --> 30:00.557
The Stanford Plaza Hotel.

30:03.400 --> 30:07.393
I think they were
having an affair.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.268
(door opens)

30:16.180 --> 30:19.069
Jonathan Eldredge
is denying everything.

30:19.110 --> 30:20.600
That's not my problem.

30:20.650 --> 30:21.548
All the nights you went

30:21.580 --> 30:23.912
to the hotel with him
across the street,

30:23.950 --> 30:27.852
that is your problem.

30:27.890 --> 30:31.087
Oh, my God.

30:31.130 --> 30:32.529
Sarah, I don't care
about your personal life.

30:32.560 --> 30:34.949
That's your business.

30:35.000 --> 30:37.491
All I care about
is what he said to you

30:37.530 --> 30:39.521
the night of the accident,
that's all.

30:39.570 --> 30:42.164
(baby fussing)

30:42.200 --> 30:44.134
(man talking quietly)

30:44.170 --> 30:46.331
Shh. It's okay.

30:53.650 --> 30:57.108
He wanted to talk;
he was so upset.

30:59.250 --> 31:00.649
He said he knew for a while

31:00.690 --> 31:02.351
there was a problem
with the pressure sensor.

31:02.390 --> 31:06.326
He'd been trying
to fix it quietly.

31:07.530 --> 31:08.656
Sarah, I need to demonstrate

31:08.700 --> 31:10.520
that Eldredge knew
about the problem

31:10.560 --> 31:12.562
before the accident.

31:12.600 --> 31:15.899
But there's no document,
there's no smoking gun,

31:15.940 --> 31:17.237
and I don't have the time
to find one.

31:17.270 --> 31:19.409
All I've got is you.

31:19.440 --> 31:20.668
I can't testify!

31:20.710 --> 31:23.474
This isn't about
the affair, Sarah.

31:23.510 --> 31:24.977
This is about the accident.

31:25.010 --> 31:26.648
The only way I know
about the accident

31:26.680 --> 31:28.944
is because of the affair, and
I will have to talk about it.

31:28.980 --> 31:31.540
IfI don't, they'll bring it up.

31:31.590 --> 31:34.684
They'll say
I'm getting back at him,

31:34.720 --> 31:36.153
that I'm bitter.

31:36.190 --> 31:37.953
You know how they'll
twist this around.

31:37.990 --> 31:40.925
There's no other way.

31:40.960 --> 31:42.450
(door opens, baby crying)

31:42.500 --> 31:46.129
I'm sorry, hon.
Dylan only wants you.

31:46.170 --> 31:48.229
(baby crying)

31:48.270 --> 31:49.965
Is everything all right?

31:50.000 --> 31:51.558
Yeah, fine.

31:51.610 --> 31:52.702
I love you.

31:52.740 --> 31:55.937
(crying continues)

31:55.980 --> 31:58.005
(door closes, crying stops)

31:59.410 --> 32:00.968
How old did you say Dylan was?

32:01.020 --> 32:03.318
Three months.

32:09.020 --> 32:11.727
It's not just me.

32:11.760 --> 32:15.992
It's my husband,
it's my other kids,

32:16.030 --> 32:18.521
it's a baby.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.526
They have nothing to do
with this,

32:20.570 --> 32:22.492
but if you make me testify...

32:24.210 --> 32:27.407
Please don't do to me
what somebody did to you.

32:32.110 --> 32:34.647
MAN:
Wow, you are really
obsessed with him.

32:34.680 --> 32:37.615
Not obsessed. Intrigued.

32:37.650 --> 32:40.289
So, is he seeing anyone?

32:40.320 --> 32:42.584
So that's what
this is about.

32:42.620 --> 32:44.281
You want me
to introduce you?
No.

32:44.330 --> 32:45.627
I was just...
OVERBY:
Introduce whom?

32:47.490 --> 32:49.720
Malcolm Overby.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.364
Kalinda.

32:51.400 --> 32:52.526
Kalinda what?

32:52.570 --> 32:53.764
Kalinda Smith.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.734
(laughs)

32:55.770 --> 32:59.001
Uh, I'm a lawyer.

32:59.040 --> 33:01.031
My firm threw this party.

33:01.080 --> 33:02.069
Oh.

33:02.110 --> 33:03.407
What do you do?

33:03.440 --> 33:05.772
I crash other
people's parties.

33:05.810 --> 33:07.300
(chuckles)

33:10.780 --> 33:14.056
So, if I gave you my card,

33:14.090 --> 33:16.183
what are the chances
you'd use it?

33:17.220 --> 33:19.256
I'd say pretty good.

33:25.830 --> 33:28.037
Use it
however you want.

33:34.740 --> 33:37.675
So, I take it you have
some information.

33:40.450 --> 33:41.815
Yeah.

33:41.850 --> 33:44.045
I looked deeper
into Mr. Overby,

33:44.090 --> 33:47.446
and I don't think he's a good
candidate for partnership.

33:47.490 --> 33:49.082
Based on my
investigation,

33:49.120 --> 33:51.827
he appears to be
nonexclusive.

33:51.860 --> 33:53.828
Nonexclusive?

33:53.860 --> 33:55.623
In pursuit of
other options.

33:55.660 --> 33:57.196
Openly in pursuit.

33:59.100 --> 34:00.727
Are you sure?

34:00.770 --> 34:02.635
Positive.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.660
The firm can do better.

34:09.180 --> 34:10.499
Well, thank you, Kalinda,

34:10.540 --> 34:12.770
for your discretion
in this matter.

34:12.810 --> 34:14.141
Always.

34:14.180 --> 34:16.148
And, Kalinda,
let's talk tomorrow

34:16.180 --> 34:18.080
about renegotiating
your contract.

34:19.120 --> 34:20.439
I'd like that.

34:36.370 --> 34:38.167
This is it.

34:38.210 --> 34:40.303
Every pill
in our medicine cabinet.

34:40.340 --> 34:44.174
And_th_is... this is
a prescription Jimmy got

34:44.210 --> 34:45.643
a month before
the accident.

34:45.680 --> 34:48.376
It's for allergies.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.274
Do you think that could be it?

34:51.320 --> 34:52.617
It could be.

34:52.650 --> 34:54.789
The drug test didn't screen
for pseudoephedrine.

34:54.820 --> 34:57.414
Not in this dosage.

34:57.460 --> 34:59.189
Thanks, Linda.

35:01.160 --> 35:02.457
Have a good night.

35:02.500 --> 35:04.092
You, too.

35:10.870 --> 35:13.862
(dramatic music plays on TV)

35:13.910 --> 35:15.798
ALICIA:
Was it frightening?

35:15.840 --> 35:17.478
GRACE:
No.

35:17.510 --> 35:19.444
I just... I don't
like him in there.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.846
I like seeing
Dad in a suit.

35:21.880 --> 35:24.280
Yeah, me, too.

35:24.320 --> 35:26.311
So, you're okay?

35:26.350 --> 35:27.749
Yeah.

35:27.790 --> 35:29.815
I mean, I'm
mad at him,

35:29.860 --> 35:31.851
but he's
still Dad.

35:32.930 --> 35:34.557
What about you?

35:34.600 --> 35:35.828
You look sad.

35:35.860 --> 35:37.225
No.

35:37.260 --> 35:39.160
It's just this case
I'm working on.

35:39.200 --> 35:41.760
Might have to do something
I don't want to.

35:41.800 --> 35:43.859
Something?

35:43.900 --> 35:46.437
You know, like what
happened to us.

35:46.470 --> 35:47.835
Oh.

35:47.870 --> 35:49.599
Well, you said "might."

35:49.640 --> 35:51.346
Is there another way?

35:51.380 --> 35:55.168
Not that I can think of.

35:55.220 --> 35:56.949
Well, you're a
lawyer, right?

35:56.980 --> 35:59.483
You have to represent
your client.

35:59.520 --> 36:02.614
Even if it means_
hurting another family?

36:05.860 --> 36:07.782
Well, if you didn't,

36:07.830 --> 36:09.650
you'd just hurt
your client, right?

36:09.700 --> 36:11.861
You have to
do your job.

36:11.900 --> 36:14.789
You can't just
not do your job.

36:20.970 --> 36:22.574
So, three days later,
and you still

36:22.610 --> 36:23.702
have depositions to conduct?

36:23.740 --> 36:26.243
Your Honor,
Ms. Nyholm stomped out

36:26.280 --> 36:27.599
of Mr. Eldredge's
deposition

36:27.650 --> 36:29.618
two days ago,
and we have been constrained

36:29.650 --> 36:31.845
with questioning Mrs. Conley
and Mr. Eldredge ever since.

36:31.890 --> 36:32.879
As melodramatic

36:32.920 --> 36:33.944
as Mr. Gardner's account is,

36:33.990 --> 36:34.979
Your Honor,
I think the last time

36:35.020 --> 36:37.488
I stomped out of anywhere
was the third grade.

36:37.520 --> 36:38.589
(chuckles)

36:38.630 --> 36:40.518
Unless I've grown bigger
than I thought.

36:41.530 --> 36:42.724
(clears throat)

36:42.760 --> 36:43.727
Uh, we ask, Your Honor,

36:43.760 --> 36:45.796
for an open deposition,
so that you may rule...

36:45.830 --> 36:48.333
They're going to force her
to testify in open court?

36:48.370 --> 36:51.237
If she denies the affair,
they'll accuse her of perjury.

36:51.270 --> 36:52.259
Then, everything she says

36:52.310 --> 36:53.504
in court
will get thrown out.

36:53.540 --> 36:54.802
(Parks clears throat)

36:54.840 --> 36:56.637
Who are you deposing?

36:56.680 --> 36:58.978
Ms. Sarah Conley,
Your Honor.

37:10.990 --> 37:12.582
(whispering):
Please don't do this.

37:12.630 --> 37:14.325
I'm so sorry.

37:25.610 --> 37:28.329
Mrs. Conley,
what did Mr. Jonathan Eldredge

37:28.380 --> 37:29.677
tell you
on the night

37:29.710 --> 37:30.574
of August 5,

37:30.610 --> 37:32.339
a few hours after
the Lakeshore crash?

37:32.380 --> 37:33.802
Objection, Your Honor.

37:33.850 --> 37:34.942
No foundation.

37:34.980 --> 37:36.015
Ms. Florrick has yet

37:36.050 --> 37:37.119
to establish
access.

37:37.150 --> 37:39.448
WILL:
Your Honor, do we need
to establish access?

37:39.490 --> 37:40.843
They work in the
same company.

37:40.890 --> 37:43.586
But in vastly different
departments.

37:43.620 --> 37:44.780
Sustained.

37:46.660 --> 37:49.458
Ms. Conley, where were you
on the evening of August 5

37:49.500 --> 37:50.694
after the Lakeshore crash?

37:58.410 --> 38:01.607
I was in a hotel room downtown.

38:01.640 --> 38:03.403
Were you alone?

38:05.510 --> 38:07.375
No.

38:08.950 --> 38:11.714
I was with Jonathan Eldredge.

38:39.610 --> 38:41.612
*

39:14.450 --> 39:17.078
Mr. Harkin, can...
can you hear us?

39:17.120 --> 39:19.543
HARKIN (static crackles):
No, no, that's good enough.

39:20.550 --> 39:21.653
Where is your
assistant?

39:21.690 --> 39:23.385
I don't know. She quit.

39:23.420 --> 39:25.786
It's very hard to find
a good assistant these days.

39:25.830 --> 39:27.923
Mr. Harkin, I'm going to make
our final offer now.

39:27.960 --> 39:29.598
HARKIN:
Go ahead.

39:37.670 --> 39:39.433
I think you can see
this meets

39:39.470 --> 39:41.108
all of your demands
and then some.

39:41.140 --> 39:43.779
Under one condition:
that we don't go to trial.

39:44.810 --> 39:46.107
I think we can handle that.

39:46.150 --> 39:47.799
There is one other thing.

39:49.820 --> 39:51.481
They want an apology.

39:51.520 --> 39:53.044
Excuse me?

39:53.090 --> 39:54.148
HARKIN:
Fine.

39:54.190 --> 39:55.851
Mr. Harkin?

39:55.890 --> 39:58.381
Just settle this thing,
will you?

40:04.160 --> 40:05.969
Well, Patti...

40:06.000 --> 40:07.126
it's always
a pleasure.

40:07.170 --> 40:08.467
Yep.

40:08.500 --> 40:09.660
Until next time.

40:11.970 --> 40:13.506
Mrs. Florrick.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.488
(laughs)

40:33.790 --> 40:35.792
(indistinct murmuring)

40:40.130 --> 40:41.688
Excuse me.
You got a minute?

40:41.740 --> 40:43.560
Sure.

40:43.600 --> 40:45.659
This one looks pretty good,
and if you don't like this one,

40:45.710 --> 40:47.564
I think we need to start
looking at the new crop

40:47.610 --> 40:49.134
of Ivy Leaguers.
Hmm.

40:51.010 --> 40:52.602
Courtney, this is
Alicia Florrick.

40:52.650 --> 40:54.208
Hi.

40:54.250 --> 40:56.571
Hi.

41:02.090 --> 41:04.183
(buzzer sounds, man speaks
indistinctly over P.A.)

41:19.540 --> 41:20.859
I didn't expect you.

41:21.910 --> 41:23.229
Spur of the moment.
Ah.

41:23.280 --> 41:25.248
Sorry I missed
your birthday.

41:25.280 --> 41:27.202
The kids said
the visit went well.

41:27.250 --> 41:29.969
Yeah, they...
they look great.

41:31.320 --> 41:33.538
Zach's almost as
tall as I am.

41:34.590 --> 41:36.615
Three months,
then suddenly, boom.

41:36.660 --> 41:38.651
(sighs)

41:39.730 --> 41:41.994
So, um...

41:42.030 --> 41:45.591
Mom tells me you're working
on a hard case.

41:45.630 --> 41:47.188
Yep.

41:48.600 --> 41:51.535
I guess you're putting in
a lot of hours with Will.

41:55.640 --> 41:57.938
A lot of time to think
about things in here.

41:58.980 --> 42:01.198
A lot of time
out there, too.

42:01.250 --> 42:03.810
He's not what he
seems, AliCia.

42:03.850 --> 42:06.978
Peter, if it's one thing
I'm learning...

42:07.020 --> 42:08.988
nobody is.

42:09.020 --> 42:10.817
Gardner acts like
he's this good guy

42:10.860 --> 42:12.589
and he's everybody's
best friend,

42:12.630 --> 42:15.690
but I could tell you a
few things about him.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.262
(laughs softly)

42:20.300 --> 42:22.632
What?

42:22.670 --> 42:24.604
Can we... (laughing)

42:24.640 --> 42:27.029
Can we at least acknowledge

42:27.070 --> 42:29.300
_ how ironi_c _
this conversation is?

42:29.340 --> 42:31.205
(laughs)

42:33.180 --> 42:34.670
I love you.

42:37.980 --> 42:41.279
I was thinking about our
apartment on 815t Street.

42:41.320 --> 42:42.856
Remember?

42:42.890 --> 42:44.016
No air-conditioning.

42:44.060 --> 42:46.153
It was so hot you'd...
you'd run around

42:46.190 --> 42:48.624
in that T-shirt you got
from the Mexican restaurant

42:48.660 --> 42:50.355
below.

42:50.400 --> 42:52.288
All I could think was,

42:52.330 --> 42:54.992
God, you were the most
beautiful woman in the world.

42:55.040 --> 42:56.064
Then?

42:56.100 --> 42:58.637
No. Then and now.

42:58.670 --> 43:01.605
I don't want
to lose you.

43:01.640 --> 43:02.629
I don't know what happened.

43:02.680 --> 43:03.908
I lost my way.

43:03.940 --> 43:05.669
I... I got on a power trip.

43:05.710 --> 43:06.972
Don't.

43:07.010 --> 43:08.341
Don't blame it on that.

43:09.380 --> 43:10.779
(sighs)

43:10.820 --> 43:12.811
I'm sorry.

43:15.060 --> 43:16.311
No, it's me.

43:16.360 --> 43:18.578
I understand.

43:20.190 --> 43:21.851
I understand.

43:23.760 --> 43:25.591
But don't give up on me.
