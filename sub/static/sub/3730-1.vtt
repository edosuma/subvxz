00:17.960 --> 00:22.747
But mommy got mad and said
I couldn't play anymore.

00:22.798 --> 00:26.751
I said it was an accident,
but she didn't believe me.

00:26.802 --> 00:29.587
If daddy was home, he would have listened,

00:29.638 --> 00:32.590
but daddy's gone. Daddy's always gone.

00:32.641 --> 00:35.843
Mommy says his job is very important.

00:35.894 --> 00:38.512
He's a scientist. He looks at stuff.

00:38.563 --> 00:41.682
I can't remember what now,
but he said when I'm older

00:41.733 --> 00:45.019
he'll show me the funny-looking buildings.

00:45.070 --> 00:47.906
No, I can do it... I promise!

00:47.970 --> 00:50.355
Harper, time to get out
of those wet clothes.

00:50.389 --> 00:54.192
No, I don't want to! I'm still
learning all the rules!

00:54.226 --> 00:56.027
Who are you talking to?

00:56.061 --> 00:59.197
A friend.

01:00.899 --> 01:03.701
- What's your friend's name?
- Drill.

01:03.736 --> 01:06.537
That's an interesting name.

01:06.572 --> 01:09.540
Do you think Drill would like
to join us for lunch?

01:11.577 --> 01:14.545
He said that would be very amenable to him.

01:14.580 --> 01:17.048
"Amenable." Okay.

01:24.172 --> 01:25.807
Uh, no running in the house, please.

01:25.841 --> 01:29.644
I know but the game already started!

01:30.276 --> 01:31.743
Hi, Liz!

01:31.777 --> 01:34.079
Hello?

01:34.113 --> 01:35.747
Liz?

01:35.781 --> 01:38.917
Oh, no, I can hear you.
No, just some interference.

01:38.951 --> 01:40.919
Yeah.

02:05.728 --> 02:09.064
So, Harper has a new friend.

02:09.066 --> 02:11.783
He's what you might call imaginary.

02:11.817 --> 02:14.068
I know. Adorable, right?

02:14.070 --> 02:16.287
I wonder why some kids
have them and others don't.

02:18.124 --> 02:20.241
Yes!

02:22.628 --> 02:24.746
I know.

02:24.797 --> 02:26.798
I remember.

02:26.832 --> 02:28.466
Yeah, he flew out this morning.

02:28.501 --> 02:30.818
One of the reactors was having problems.

02:30.853 --> 02:33.588
Oh, my God.

02:33.590 --> 02:35.223
Harper? What happened?

02:35.257 --> 02:37.559
I'm okay!

02:40.479 --> 02:41.596
No.

02:41.647 --> 02:43.598
Oh, yeah, just Harper playing.

02:43.649 --> 02:45.266
Um, I got to go, Liz, okay?

02:45.317 --> 02:46.934
I'll call you back later?

02:46.986 --> 02:49.153
Okay.

02:49.188 --> 02:51.005
Harper?

02:51.040 --> 02:53.741
Time for lunch!

02:58.364 --> 03:00.998
Not cool, Harper.

03:07.790 --> 03:11.292
Harper?

03:13.629 --> 03:16.430
This isn't funny! Where are you?!

03:16.465 --> 03:19.133
I'm here! Hi, mommy!

03:19.135 --> 03:21.636
You know you're not allowed
up there without me!

03:21.638 --> 03:22.804
It isn't safe!

03:22.855 --> 03:25.690
I tried calling you,
but you weren't listening.

03:25.724 --> 03:27.859
You're always talking on the phone, mommy.

03:27.943 --> 03:31.145
That's no excuse! Come down now!

03:31.147 --> 03:33.981
No, you need to come up!

03:33.983 --> 03:35.650
The game isn't over.

03:35.652 --> 03:37.318
Harper!

03:40.906 --> 03:43.207
Harper!

03:43.241 --> 03:45.960
She's coming.

03:45.994 --> 03:48.462
Harper.

03:51.583 --> 03:53.567
Who are you talking to?

03:53.602 --> 03:54.669
You know, Drill,

03:54.703 --> 03:56.337
but you're not allowed to talk to him.

03:56.371 --> 03:57.505
He says you're "it."

03:57.539 --> 03:58.672
Well, tell him

03:58.674 --> 04:00.841
I'm not in the mood to talk to him either.

04:00.843 --> 04:02.009
Now let's go.

04:02.044 --> 04:03.894
I already told you, mom.

04:03.929 --> 04:04.895
You never listen.

04:04.930 --> 04:06.914
Not until we finish the game.

04:06.948 --> 04:09.567
"X" marks the spot.

04:09.601 --> 04:11.886
You're supposed to step on it.

04:11.920 --> 04:14.155
Why aren't you playing, mommy?

04:14.189 --> 04:16.574
You don't want me to win?

04:16.608 --> 04:17.690
Okay, okay.

04:17.726 --> 04:20.778
I'll step on it, and then we go down, okay?

04:40.782 --> 04:43.584
I did it! I did it!

04:43.618 --> 04:47.054
Drill?

04:47.105 --> 04:49.089
Where are you?

04:49.124 --> 04:50.891
I won.

04:53.061 --> 04:55.529
Mommy?

04:55.563 --> 04:58.532
Mommy?

04:58.566 --> 05:01.568
You can wake up now.

05:01.619 --> 05:04.738
The game's over.

05:04.789 --> 05:07.074
Mommy, wake up.

05:07.125 --> 05:08.775
Please?

05:41.542 --> 05:43.160
Let's go, Henry!

05:43.194 --> 05:46.113
Whoo!

05:46.164 --> 05:48.949
Yes! Run! Whoo!

05:49.000 --> 05:50.117
Run, Henry, run!

05:50.168 --> 05:53.670
Whoo!

05:58.209 --> 06:00.510
Oh.

06:04.715 --> 06:06.349
This is Agent Bennigan.

06:06.384 --> 06:08.685
Claire, it's Director Myers.

06:08.719 --> 06:10.186
Hello, sir.

06:10.221 --> 06:12.939
- Strike one!
- Oh, damn it.

06:12.974 --> 06:14.140
- Hey, where are you?
- I... I'm sorry.

06:14.192 --> 06:17.143
I'm at my... My son's baseball game.

06:17.194 --> 06:19.779
Oh, that's great. Well, look.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.781
I know you're still on leave,
but we just got a case.

06:21.816 --> 06:23.783
A 6-year-old girl tried to
kill her mother. Come on.

06:23.818 --> 06:25.785
And all signs point to premeditation.

06:25.820 --> 06:27.787
Strike two! Well... ohh.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.489
Well, that's horrible,

06:29.491 --> 06:30.990
but it sounds like
it's something for the locals.

06:30.992 --> 06:32.325
Well, as it turns out, the kid's dad

06:32.327 --> 06:34.327
heads up the nuclear regulatory commission.

06:34.329 --> 06:36.663
So by jurisdiction,
the case turns over to us.

06:36.665 --> 06:38.998
- Be a hitter now. Be a hitter.
- National security.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.417
Sir, with all due respect,

06:40.468 --> 06:42.836
we both know that these cases,
they're just a formality.

06:42.838 --> 06:44.971
Any specialist can take it.
Why are you calling me?

06:45.005 --> 06:46.306
Ball one!

06:46.340 --> 06:48.641
Claire, it's been three months.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.427
I thought a case might do you good.

06:54.515 --> 06:59.185
Okay. Okay, I'll be right in.

06:59.187 --> 07:00.520
Great! Okay, I need you to get in here now.

07:00.522 --> 07:02.689
Oh! Whoo!

07:02.691 --> 07:05.692
Let's go! Make it home!

07:05.694 --> 07:07.577
Hello? Hello? Okay.

07:07.611 --> 07:08.912
Run, Henry!

07:08.946 --> 07:09.996
Run!

07:11.248 --> 07:13.666
Safe!

07:13.701 --> 07:17.036
Yes! Safe! Safe!

07:19.707 --> 07:21.674
Hey, hey!

07:21.709 --> 07:23.208
Hey, you did it.

07:23.210 --> 07:24.711
Yeah.

07:24.713 --> 07:28.715
That was the office.
They want me to come in.

07:29.108 --> 07:31.808
_

07:33.655 --> 07:36.355
_

07:38.475 --> 07:41.110
Yeah, I guess that's true.

07:41.145 --> 07:43.980
And it's what your dad would have wanted.

07:45.399 --> 07:48.734
I'll tell grammy to take you home, okay?

07:48.736 --> 07:50.736
Batter up.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.072
But promise me something.

07:53.074 --> 07:54.907
Hit another one for me.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.417
Thanks for coming in.

08:05.802 --> 08:08.054
Hi.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.889
Who won?

08:09.923 --> 08:11.724
Oh, it isn't over yet.

08:11.758 --> 08:13.392
Agent Rollins,
this is our child specialist.

08:13.427 --> 08:15.061
- Agent Bennigan.
- Hello.

08:15.095 --> 08:16.762
Your reputation precedes you.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.432
The crime scene...

08:19.434 --> 08:21.100
clear signs of tampering
with the tree house.

08:21.102 --> 08:23.402
Please sit.

08:26.189 --> 08:30.776
You're telling me a
6-year-old did this by herself?

08:30.778 --> 08:31.827
You know kids these days.

08:31.862 --> 08:33.328
Probably learned it on the Internet.

08:33.363 --> 08:35.614
Clearly you don't have kids, Agent Rollins.

08:35.664 --> 08:37.332
Has she said anything?

08:37.366 --> 08:39.835
We were waiting for your expertise.

08:39.870 --> 08:42.171
You guys don't have a lot of time.

08:42.205 --> 08:43.923
The grandmother has given us
permission to question the girl,

08:43.957 --> 08:46.125
but the dad's on his way
back from a trip, so...

08:46.176 --> 08:47.793
Let's get started.

08:52.015 --> 08:53.766
Rollins, a word, please?

08:55.685 --> 08:57.102
Sir.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.772
I know there's some talk going
around about Agent Bennigan.

08:59.806 --> 09:01.640
I'm gonna take a guess and say

09:01.642 --> 09:03.642
it's the same folks talking about you.

09:03.693 --> 09:05.361
Two disciplinary actions will

09:05.386 --> 09:07.029
- do that around here.
- Sir...

09:07.063 --> 09:08.814
and for God's sake,
she just lost her husband.

09:08.865 --> 09:11.483
So do me the courtesy
of rising to the occasion

09:11.534 --> 09:12.818
and doing your damn job,

09:12.820 --> 09:15.321
because I assure you
that's what she's gonna do.

09:15.371 --> 09:17.489
- Do I make myself clear?
- Loud and clear, sir.

09:17.491 --> 09:19.825
Good. Go clear this case.

09:19.876 --> 09:21.827
Mommy, look.

09:24.381 --> 09:26.832
That was amazing, Minx!

09:26.834 --> 09:30.385
Looks like those
gymnastics classes are paying off.

09:30.420 --> 09:32.554
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

09:32.589 --> 09:34.556
Wish I could say the same
about Noah's piano lessons.

09:34.591 --> 09:38.410
I totally caved in.
I did the whole bribing thing.

09:38.444 --> 09:39.978
Hey.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.480
Is everything okay?

09:41.514 --> 09:43.148
I'm sorry.

09:43.182 --> 09:44.816
You were saying?

09:44.851 --> 09:47.903
Lena, how are things going
with you and Wes?

09:47.937 --> 09:52.574
You know, we're still working through it.

09:52.608 --> 09:55.077
The new job is helping.

09:55.111 --> 09:57.195
He actually got called
to Africa this morning.

09:57.246 --> 09:58.897
What's he doing again?

09:58.932 --> 10:01.033
He's with the defense
department, special projects.

10:01.084 --> 10:04.369
Hmm. Not really sure what he does,

10:04.371 --> 10:06.755
but at least he's not around her anymore.

10:08.374 --> 10:12.677
I know I shouldn't say this,
but he's lucky you stayed.

10:12.712 --> 10:15.514
I still love him.

10:54.637 --> 10:57.589
Mr. Wes Lawrence, General Damba.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.758
This is my assistant, Peter kim.

10:59.809 --> 11:01.426
I have to admit, general,
when you called this morning,

11:01.477 --> 11:02.949
we weren't expecting a trip

11:02.974 --> 11:04.312
- across the desert.
- Yes.

11:04.347 --> 11:06.431
I do apologize for the rush notice.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.234
But I assure you,
the matter's of utmost urgency.

11:12.105 --> 11:13.321
Hey, uh, wait a minute!

11:13.355 --> 11:15.657
They are not authorized
to be on the premises.

11:15.691 --> 11:17.492
Why don't you tell me what's going on?

11:17.526 --> 11:19.327
Your question will be answered in a moment,

11:19.361 --> 11:21.246
but I must warn you, Mr. Lawrence,

11:21.280 --> 11:23.364
more questions will be coming.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.791
Harper.

11:33.793 --> 11:35.677
Tell me about this game.

11:35.711 --> 11:38.363
I'm not supposed to say.

11:38.397 --> 11:41.332
You're not supposed to say?

11:41.367 --> 11:42.900
This is a safe room, Harper.

11:42.935 --> 11:45.336
You can say anything
that you want in here, okay?

11:45.371 --> 11:47.305
It's just us. The door is closed.

11:47.307 --> 11:50.441
But he said grown-ups wouldn't understand.

11:50.476 --> 11:52.694
You're not gonna believe me.

11:52.728 --> 11:54.645
Who said that? Who is this person?

11:54.647 --> 11:56.447
My friend Drill.

11:58.817 --> 12:00.151
Is Drill from school?

12:01.370 --> 12:02.370
He a grown-up, like me?

12:03.572 --> 12:06.040
What does he look like?

12:06.074 --> 12:08.876
I don't know. I can't see him.

12:08.911 --> 12:10.211
You can't see him?

12:10.245 --> 12:12.880
Well, Harper,
how do you know when he's there?

12:12.915 --> 12:15.333
How do you know when to talk to him?

12:15.335 --> 12:17.552
He speaks through the lights sometimes.

12:20.422 --> 12:23.224
What kind of stuff does he say?

12:23.258 --> 12:26.394
Lots of things...
he says, if I won the game,

12:26.428 --> 12:31.566
we were gonna have a "domba..."
"Domino-tion."

12:31.600 --> 12:34.352
Now I can't remember the word he used.

12:34.403 --> 12:36.571
Was that word "domination"?

12:36.605 --> 12:38.689
Yeah, that's the word.

12:38.740 --> 12:41.559
That's the word.

12:41.576 --> 12:43.561
That's a pretty big word.

12:43.595 --> 12:46.080
Drill knows lots of things.

12:46.114 --> 12:49.083
He even told the questions
you were gonna ask,

12:49.117 --> 12:52.503
but I think I forgot them.

12:52.537 --> 12:54.205
Harper...

12:56.124 --> 12:57.591
is Drill here right now?

12:57.626 --> 13:00.044
He's gone. He's not here anymore.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.595
Do you know where he is?

13:01.630 --> 13:04.515
The game isn't done yet.

13:06.384 --> 13:09.804
He's looking for a new friend.

13:21.983 --> 13:25.202
Yeah, I can hear you.

13:28.957 --> 13:30.908
Yeah, I'd like to play.

13:35.580 --> 13:36.697
So, what do you say?

13:36.699 --> 13:39.566
Time to turn it back over to the locals?

13:39.600 --> 13:43.570
I don't know. Something doesn't feel right.

13:43.604 --> 13:46.573
I'm sorry. Am I missing something here?

13:46.607 --> 13:47.874
You heard her.

13:47.925 --> 13:49.409
6-year-olds don't talk like that.

13:49.444 --> 13:50.677
Someone's coached her.

13:50.712 --> 13:52.179
Oh, you mean like her imaginary friend?

13:52.213 --> 13:53.714
Listen, I get that you want to impress

13:53.765 --> 13:55.716
on your first case back...

13:55.718 --> 13:56.883
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that is not what this is about.

13:56.885 --> 13:58.185
Are you sure?

13:58.219 --> 14:00.554
Harper.

14:00.605 --> 14:02.389
Daddy!

14:02.440 --> 14:05.358
Come on. Let's go see mommy.

14:05.393 --> 14:07.227
Alex, I need more time.

14:08.140 --> 14:09.257
What's the problem?

14:09.308 --> 14:11.292
Agent Bennigan thinks there's a case here.

14:11.326 --> 14:13.928
- And you don't?
- No, sir, I don't.

14:13.979 --> 14:15.847
Claire?

14:17.933 --> 14:20.234
Claire?

14:20.269 --> 14:21.736
Claire?!

14:21.770 --> 14:24.739
Hey, wait a minute.

14:24.773 --> 14:26.741
Rollins?

14:29.611 --> 14:31.445
Can I get an answer, please?

14:31.447 --> 14:32.947
Harper.

14:32.949 --> 14:34.699
Here. Come... wait. Hey, hey.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.251
- Is this Drill?
- No.

14:36.299 --> 14:37.416
This questioning is over.

14:37.467 --> 14:39.285
I suggest you get a warrant.

14:39.315 --> 14:41.553
Harper, Drill... he's real, isn't he?

14:41.588 --> 14:43.889
I swear, but, you know,
I wasn't the only one.

14:43.923 --> 14:45.757
Drill said there was another boy.

14:45.759 --> 14:47.535
- What boy?
- I don't know, but

14:47.560 --> 14:49.311
he couldn't win the game.

14:50.763 --> 14:53.231
Why can't you accept
the kid was playing you?

14:53.266 --> 14:54.566
And you saw the crime scene.

14:54.601 --> 14:56.818
That's the work of a disturbed mind.

14:56.853 --> 15:00.155
And yet she exhibits none
of the traits of a psychopath.

15:00.189 --> 15:02.157
Nor is she or her imaginary friend

15:02.191 --> 15:03.992
a national threat.

15:04.026 --> 15:05.277
And that's what our job
is to determine here.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.112
- We're not on some rescue mission.
- Take a look at this.

15:07.114 --> 15:09.781
Jackson Bellings, age 10.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.166
One month ago,

15:11.200 --> 15:13.919
he detonated a homemade bomb
at Westings Designs.

15:13.953 --> 15:17.089
He died that day.
But his mother, she survived.

15:17.123 --> 15:18.290
Yeah, I remember that case.

15:18.341 --> 15:20.292
Structural engineering firm,
government contracts.

15:20.343 --> 15:22.127
"The subject believed
he was under the influence

15:22.178 --> 15:25.463
"of an imaginary entity named 'Drill.'

15:25.515 --> 15:27.632
claimed he was playing a game."

15:27.683 --> 15:29.801
So maybe there's some game that's
spreading around the playground.

15:29.852 --> 15:31.353
One kid hears about an imaginary friend,

15:31.387 --> 15:32.395
the next thing you know...

15:32.535 --> 15:33.495
No, no, it doesn't work like that.

15:33.523 --> 15:34.973
For children with imaginary friends,

15:35.024 --> 15:37.642
these... these... these
connections, they're sacred.

15:37.644 --> 15:39.444
And besides, most kids
with imaginary friends,

15:39.478 --> 15:40.946
they know that they're not real.

15:40.980 --> 15:42.614
Harper, on the other hand...

15:42.648 --> 15:45.283
So someone's communicating
telepathically with these kids?

15:45.318 --> 15:47.619
No, what I am saying is
that there are some children

15:47.653 --> 15:48.787
who are easily manipulated

15:48.821 --> 15:53.658
into believing what is real
is not and vice versa.

15:53.660 --> 15:56.211
Whoever is getting to these kids,

15:56.245 --> 15:58.963
he knows that.

16:00.794 --> 16:03.229
What are you doing?

16:03.242 --> 16:04.976
Playing a game with a friend.

16:05.042 --> 16:06.208
Can I play?

16:10.047 --> 16:12.014
Okay, he says you can play.

16:12.048 --> 16:14.717
I didn't hear anything.

16:14.719 --> 16:17.386
You coming or what? If not, go away.

16:17.388 --> 16:20.389
I'm coming. I'm coming.

16:27.447 --> 16:29.731
Lena, you know you can call me anytime.

16:29.783 --> 16:31.567
Thank you.

16:31.618 --> 16:33.869
I think it's just gonna take some time.

16:37.740 --> 16:38.707
What is wrong?

16:38.741 --> 16:41.460
I... I... I want to go home now, mommy.

16:41.494 --> 16:43.128
Minx?

16:45.498 --> 16:47.299
What's going on?

16:56.676 --> 16:58.977
Tell me what happened.

17:39.635 --> 17:40.936
It's one of ours.

17:40.970 --> 17:43.805
Yeah, but what's it doing here?

17:43.856 --> 17:45.307
And what happened to the pilot?

17:45.358 --> 17:47.309
We found no trace of him.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.945
But we were curious, as well,

17:49.979 --> 17:52.030
why an unauthorized American military plane

17:52.064 --> 17:53.815
would be found within our borders.

17:53.817 --> 17:57.485
You know I can't answer these questions.

17:57.487 --> 17:59.487
This isn't a special projects affair.

17:59.489 --> 18:02.040
This is air force. Why did you call me?

18:02.074 --> 18:03.792
Unfortunately, there's more.

18:03.826 --> 18:06.728
I...

18:07.546 --> 18:08.797
It's happening again.

18:25.347 --> 18:27.515
What's going on here?

18:27.566 --> 18:28.817
I'd like to introduce you to Dr. Karif.

18:28.851 --> 18:32.187
He's a geologist
from the University of Algeria.

18:32.189 --> 18:35.323
Why is a geologist interested
in a crashed fighter plane?

18:35.357 --> 18:36.824
He's not interested in your plane.

18:36.859 --> 18:38.660
There's something else we need to show you.

18:38.694 --> 18:40.662
But first, we need to suit up.

19:13.362 --> 19:15.813
What is that thing?

20:12.659 --> 20:14.042
Wes.

20:33.846 --> 20:37.182
Electricity from the plane

20:37.194 --> 20:39.411
trapped inside the rocks somehow.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.531
It seems to be affecting
the current from our light.

20:41.594 --> 20:43.727
- Any idea how long it's been here?
- We questioned some nomads

20:43.742 --> 20:45.743
who passed through the area
four months ago.

20:45.794 --> 20:47.077
Nothing was here then.

20:47.128 --> 20:50.080
Unfortunately, that's the best
timeline we have.

20:57.387 --> 20:59.871
The plane...

21:01.135 --> 21:03.487
Looks like it never
touched the ground here.

21:03.584 --> 21:05.535
You're saying it did not crash?

21:05.570 --> 21:08.705
I'm saying it looks like it was

21:08.739 --> 21:11.191
grabbed from the sky and ripped to shreds.

21:11.225 --> 21:13.460
By what?

21:30.344 --> 21:32.395
Or by who?

21:36.517 --> 21:38.518
So, what are they saying?

21:38.520 --> 21:41.404
Excuse me?

21:41.439 --> 21:43.239
The office. What are they saying about me?

21:43.274 --> 21:44.824
Listen, I'm sorry about your husband.

21:44.859 --> 21:46.326
I should have said something before.

21:46.360 --> 21:48.995
That's not what people
are talking about, is it?

21:51.081 --> 21:53.867
Let's just say it hasn't
escaped people's attention

21:53.918 --> 21:55.535
that you took your leave of absence

21:55.586 --> 21:57.036
before your husband died,

21:57.087 --> 21:59.372
the same time the assistant director did.

21:59.374 --> 22:01.374
There are those who don't think
that's a coincidence.

22:01.376 --> 22:04.377
How about you? What do you think?

22:04.411 --> 22:08.131
I think marriage is complicated.

22:10.267 --> 22:12.218
How long have you been divorced?

22:12.269 --> 22:14.554
Technically, not.

22:16.857 --> 22:19.492
Becomes official next month.

22:19.526 --> 22:21.477
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

22:21.528 --> 22:24.831
Well... Happens.

22:26.633 --> 22:29.268
- Said you had a son?
- Yeah.

22:29.303 --> 22:30.903
Henry.

22:30.954 --> 22:34.457
How's he handling everything?

22:34.491 --> 22:37.827
Two years ago, he got sick.
He lost his hearing.

22:37.878 --> 22:41.814
Three months ago, he lost his dad, so...

22:41.849 --> 22:45.485
How do you think he's handling everything?

22:47.004 --> 22:48.971
Agents Rollins and Bennigan?

22:49.006 --> 22:51.641
I can let you see her now.

22:53.844 --> 22:56.812
Ms. Bellings?

22:56.847 --> 22:59.765
My name is Claire Bennigan.
I'm with the FBI.

22:59.816 --> 23:03.202
I'm sorry to do this, but I need
to ask you about your son.

23:07.074 --> 23:09.659
This morning, a little girl
tried to hurt her mother.

23:09.693 --> 23:11.410
She said she was playing a game.

23:24.624 --> 23:27.793
"You'll get through this."

23:27.828 --> 23:30.679
That's what people say, don't they?

23:30.714 --> 23:35.017
They said it to me.
It really pissed me off.

23:35.051 --> 23:40.356
What exactly does it mean
to "get through this"?

23:40.390 --> 23:44.860
Through what? What's on the other side?

23:44.895 --> 23:48.530
I didn't want to get through it.

23:48.565 --> 23:52.651
I wanted to die... In it.

23:54.321 --> 23:58.824
And then my mom,
she said that grief is like

23:58.826 --> 24:02.461
a suitcase that sits
at the bottom of your bed.

24:02.495 --> 24:04.630
And no matter what, without fail,

24:04.664 --> 24:08.500
you have it pick it up
every day, take it with you.

24:08.502 --> 24:11.336
Some days, it will be filled with rocks,

24:11.338 --> 24:14.840
and you won't think you can carry it.

24:14.842 --> 24:17.509
And then other days...

24:17.511 --> 24:21.346
Light as a feather.

24:21.348 --> 24:26.568
That, she said, is "getting through it."

24:28.188 --> 24:30.522
It made sense to me.

24:33.526 --> 24:37.412
My husband was killed three
months ago in a plane crash.

24:37.447 --> 24:39.414
I'm sorry.

24:39.449 --> 24:40.832
And I'd be lying

24:40.867 --> 24:42.501
if I said I knew
what you were going through.

24:42.535 --> 24:45.837
I don't. I have my son.

24:45.872 --> 24:49.424
I can't imagine what
I'd be like if I lost him.

24:49.509 --> 24:53.545
Well, you're looking at it.

25:05.641 --> 25:08.610
He was found this morning
unconscious in an alleyway.

25:08.644 --> 25:10.228
No ID.

25:15.952 --> 25:19.070
That part... Something about "time,"

25:19.121 --> 25:20.405
something like "it's too late."

25:20.456 --> 25:22.324
- Too late for what?
- I'm not sure.

25:23.576 --> 25:24.809
"Lights."

25:24.844 --> 25:27.629
"Searching for lights."

25:27.663 --> 25:31.082
He's saying, "it's too late."

25:31.133 --> 25:32.918
They're searching for the lights."

25:32.969 --> 25:34.252
What does it mean?

25:34.303 --> 25:37.422
You're asking me?

25:37.473 --> 25:40.592
What happened that day at Westings?

25:40.626 --> 25:46.398
That day I went to work.

25:46.432 --> 25:48.900
I supposed Jackson was at school.

25:48.935 --> 25:51.736
But when I got up from my desk
to go to the bathroom,

25:51.771 --> 25:54.572
there he was in the hall.

25:54.607 --> 25:57.359
I said, "Jackson, what are you doing here?"

25:57.410 --> 26:01.846
And he said, "mom,
I think I'm doing a bad thing."

26:01.881 --> 26:05.333
I don't think this is a game."

26:05.368 --> 26:08.002
And before I could ask him what he meant,

26:08.037 --> 26:10.672
he ran into the supply closet.

26:10.706 --> 26:13.374
And the next thing I knew...

26:16.996 --> 26:19.597
Did he ever tell you about
his friend, Drill?

26:19.632 --> 26:22.100
Yes, he tried.

26:22.134 --> 26:25.103
When I found out
Drill wasn't real, I got mad.

26:26.472 --> 26:29.140
I told him he was too old
for that kind of stuff.

26:29.191 --> 26:32.477
You should have seen the look on his face.

26:34.230 --> 26:37.031
Someone is behind Drill.

26:37.066 --> 26:39.884
Wait.

26:39.919 --> 26:42.153
You think Drill is real?

26:42.155 --> 26:43.655
We have to find this person.

26:43.706 --> 26:45.873
Is there anything
that you remember, anyone?

26:49.411 --> 26:51.996
What?

26:51.998 --> 26:54.665
There was someone across the street.

26:54.667 --> 26:57.835
A-a man watching the building,

26:57.870 --> 27:00.004
like he was waiting for something.

27:00.006 --> 27:01.589
Can you describe this man?

27:03.559 --> 27:05.343
His eyes...

27:05.394 --> 27:07.678
it was like there was nothing there.

27:10.015 --> 27:12.817
He had all these tattoos.

27:12.851 --> 27:15.653
His body was covered with them.

27:17.773 --> 27:20.324
We need a sketch artist ASAP.

27:20.359 --> 27:23.027
Your son.

27:23.078 --> 27:25.730
Hold on to him.

27:25.764 --> 27:27.865
Don't let him go.

27:35.791 --> 27:37.708
It's okay. It's okay.

27:37.759 --> 27:39.877
I need assistance here!

27:41.546 --> 27:43.597
You're safe! You're safe!

27:43.632 --> 27:45.800
No one's hurting you! Listen to my voice!

27:45.851 --> 27:47.435
Wherever you are, come back!

27:47.469 --> 27:49.103
Come back.

27:49.137 --> 27:51.438
That's good. That's good.

27:51.473 --> 27:52.690
I'm Dr. Maria Benavidez.

27:52.724 --> 27:56.227
You're at Capitol University Hospital.

27:56.278 --> 27:58.562
Get resident back. I need him to translate.

27:58.613 --> 28:00.898
It's okay.

28:00.949 --> 28:03.234
I don't know.

28:03.236 --> 28:05.569
- I don't know.
- You speak english?

28:05.620 --> 28:09.240
We want to help you, okay?

28:09.291 --> 28:12.243
In order to do that,
we need to know your name.

28:12.294 --> 28:13.377
What's your name?

28:13.411 --> 28:15.713
My name?

28:17.882 --> 28:21.502
I don't know.

28:21.553 --> 28:23.504
I don't know.

28:26.755 --> 28:28.904
Hey, Minx. Tell me what
happened on the playground.

28:29.504 --> 28:32.089
- Why was that boy so scared?
- I don't know.

28:32.091 --> 28:34.839
- Probably 'cause he's turning.
- What does that mean?

28:36.539 --> 28:38.007
You're not gonna understand, mommy.

28:38.087 --> 28:41.539
- You're old.
- Okay.

28:42.876 --> 28:45.710
Try me. I might surprise you.

28:45.712 --> 28:48.046
When a kid gets old, they turn.

28:48.048 --> 28:50.381
And they think about stuff too much.

28:50.383 --> 28:51.683
And that's a bad thing?

28:51.717 --> 28:53.718
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, what about you? Are you turning?

28:53.769 --> 28:55.887
No.

28:55.938 --> 28:58.056
My friend says I'm never gonna turn.

28:58.107 --> 29:00.892
He thinks I'm special.

29:00.943 --> 29:04.362
Oh, Minx, that is incredible.

29:04.396 --> 29:06.364
I did it all by myself.

29:06.398 --> 29:09.700
Well, mostly. My friend,
he helped a little.

29:09.735 --> 29:11.035
What's that?

29:11.070 --> 29:13.905
That's where the light comes from.

29:13.956 --> 29:17.241
Your dad is gonna love this.

29:17.292 --> 29:20.077
No, I don't think he'll care.

29:20.128 --> 29:21.712
Daddy doesn't like us.

29:21.747 --> 29:23.297
What are you talking about?

29:23.332 --> 29:25.800
Your dad loves us.

29:25.834 --> 29:27.802
That's not what my friend told me.

29:27.836 --> 29:29.754
He said that daddy did a bad thing.

29:29.805 --> 29:31.923
You're still mad,

29:31.974 --> 29:34.258
even though you pretend not to be.

29:38.347 --> 29:41.983
Okay, Minx, I'm gonna
have to meet this friend.

29:42.017 --> 29:43.985
You will, I promise.

29:44.019 --> 29:47.488
But first, I got to go to the bathroom.

29:49.675 --> 29:50.941
Hi, you've reached Wes Lawrence.

29:50.993 --> 29:52.443
Please leave a message.

29:53.495 --> 29:55.946
Wes, you need to call me right away.

29:55.997 --> 29:58.282
Minx knows.

29:58.333 --> 30:01.952
She knows... What you did.

30:02.003 --> 30:03.454
Told you, mommy.

30:05.540 --> 30:07.792
You scared me.

30:07.794 --> 30:10.294
Daddy doesn't want to talk to you.

30:12.848 --> 30:14.798
You have one new message.

30:14.883 --> 30:16.467
Wes!

30:16.518 --> 30:18.969
You got to take a look at this.

30:19.020 --> 30:20.137
So, that F-22?

30:20.139 --> 30:21.972
- Mm-hmm.
- 94th fighter squadron.

30:21.974 --> 30:23.974
Three months ago, it was sent out

30:23.976 --> 30:25.809
on a classified surveillance run.

30:25.811 --> 30:27.444
The mission was to gather
photographic evidence

30:27.479 --> 30:29.813
of Chinese and Russian military
buildup in the arctic circle.

30:29.815 --> 30:31.649
- Mm-hmm.
- But get this.

30:31.700 --> 30:34.318
As soon as the pilot reached its target,

30:34.369 --> 30:35.786
he radioed in he was losing control.

30:35.820 --> 30:37.788
Two minutes later,
the plane disappeared off radar.

30:37.822 --> 30:39.790
The arctic circle? You're sure?

30:39.824 --> 30:41.125
Yeah, that's what it says.

30:41.159 --> 30:42.993
That's... that's almost 4,000
miles away from the wreckage.

30:43.044 --> 30:44.662
And according to the fuel log here,

30:44.713 --> 30:46.880
the plane took off with only
300 miles worth of fuel.

30:46.915 --> 30:48.715
So no way it could have made it
to that desert on its own.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.384
No.

30:52.220 --> 30:55.005
The pilot.

30:55.056 --> 30:57.374
What?

30:57.392 --> 31:00.060
I know him.

31:00.095 --> 31:01.395
So, nothing?

31:01.429 --> 31:03.480
No name, no home, no memory?

31:03.515 --> 31:04.515
Is that what you're saying?

31:04.566 --> 31:06.016
It's all fuzzy.

31:06.067 --> 31:07.684
It's, uh...

31:07.735 --> 31:11.388
It's like it's there,
just I can't reach it.

31:11.406 --> 31:13.907
- But I've been having these dreams.
- Uh-huh.

31:13.942 --> 31:17.361
I don't know what they mean,
but they're important.

31:17.363 --> 31:18.745
I know,

31:18.780 --> 31:22.399
you think I'm crazy.

31:26.838 --> 31:28.789
While you were out,

31:28.840 --> 31:30.958
you were saying something in Arabic.

31:31.009 --> 31:33.961
You said... It's not possible.
I don't speak Arabic.

31:34.012 --> 31:35.629
But we heard you.

31:35.680 --> 31:38.298
We even had someone come and translate.

31:38.349 --> 31:40.634
So what did I say?

31:40.685 --> 31:41.968
"It's too late.

31:42.020 --> 31:44.020
They're searching for the lights."

31:44.055 --> 31:47.524
You know what that means?

31:47.558 --> 31:49.226
No.

31:49.228 --> 31:51.611
Okay, I'm gonna order a C.T. scan,

31:51.646 --> 31:53.947
and hopefully it will tell us something.

32:07.845 --> 32:10.547
Hello? Are you listening?

32:13.252 --> 32:14.417
What just happened?

32:14.419 --> 32:18.421
I just... I just got this feeling.

32:18.423 --> 32:21.341
I think something's gonna happen.

32:24.428 --> 32:28.231
Hi. Are you lost?

32:28.266 --> 32:30.900
No, my mom's here. She's not feeling well.

32:30.935 --> 32:33.737
I'm sorry, but this is a private room.

32:33.771 --> 32:35.238
I'm looking for my friend.

32:35.272 --> 32:37.073
I don't think your friend's here.

32:37.108 --> 32:39.242
Let's call a nurse, and maybe
she can help you, okay?

32:39.276 --> 32:42.579
No, she won't be able to find him.

32:42.613 --> 32:47.534
But you know where he is, don't you?

32:57.059 --> 32:58.843
Oh.

33:01.042 --> 33:01.992
Hi.

33:02.043 --> 33:03.994
Hi.

33:09.290 --> 33:11.090
_

33:11.639 --> 33:13.306
No, I'm okay.

33:13.308 --> 33:16.526
I just... I missed you today.

33:16.955 --> 33:17.855
_

33:20.100 --> 33:22.268
Thanks, mom.

33:22.270 --> 33:24.653
Nothing I would rather do.

33:24.688 --> 33:27.424
- How was your day?
- It was good.

33:27.435 --> 33:29.353
It was actually kind of nice to be back.

33:29.784 --> 33:30.984
_

33:31.906 --> 33:33.190
Yeah.

33:33.241 --> 33:36.193
A kid got in trouble today.

33:36.244 --> 33:38.412
I'm trying to figure it out.

33:41.199 --> 33:42.332
Hey, what is it?

33:42.447 --> 33:47.247
_

33:48.039 --> 33:51.675
I miss him, too.

34:36.420 --> 34:37.719
That tickles!

34:41.007 --> 34:44.177
Hi! My name is Noah!

34:44.228 --> 34:47.230
Come here! Come here! Come here!

34:53.487 --> 34:56.105
I'm a little alien!

34:56.156 --> 34:58.141
Whoo-hoo!

34:58.175 --> 34:59.809
Not now, Drill.

34:59.827 --> 35:01.778
Come here! Come here!

35:02.948 --> 35:06.282
I know. The game never stops.

36:05.726 --> 36:06.976
That's easy.

36:07.010 --> 36:09.912
It's the day the Baltimore Colts
won the Super Bowl.

36:13.934 --> 36:16.902
Okay. Now what?

36:18.939 --> 36:21.824
When's John Doe expected
to be back from his tests?

36:21.858 --> 36:22.992
Uh, hasn't gone in yet.

36:23.026 --> 36:26.328
Still waiting for the machine
to be available.

36:26.363 --> 36:28.330
Call security now.

36:28.365 --> 36:30.499
Tell them we have a runaway.

37:01.231 --> 37:03.699
Oh, my God.

37:03.733 --> 37:05.401
Oh, my God.

37:12.075 --> 37:13.625
Okay.

37:13.660 --> 37:15.661
Yes.

37:27.473 --> 37:31.143
- Rollins.
- Claire.

37:31.177 --> 37:33.362
- Rollins, I think he's after a new target
- Claire, it's me, Wes.

37:36.182 --> 37:37.482
Are you there?

37:37.517 --> 37:38.834
Why are you calling?

37:38.868 --> 37:41.737
There's something I need to tell you.

37:41.771 --> 37:43.488
No, it's over. We both agreed.

37:43.523 --> 37:46.074
It's about Sean.

37:46.109 --> 37:48.410
Don't say his name. Please.

37:48.444 --> 37:51.747
Believe me, I wouldn't be
calling if I didn't need to.

37:51.781 --> 37:53.915
I want to put the past behind us
as much as you.

37:53.950 --> 37:55.450
Well, then, why are you calling?

37:57.503 --> 37:59.504
Because we found Sean's plane.

37:59.539 --> 38:01.757
When?

38:01.791 --> 38:04.793
Today. The Sahara Desert.

38:04.844 --> 38:06.128
No, that's impossible,

38:06.179 --> 38:08.463
because he crashed in the arctic, so...

38:08.514 --> 38:09.931
That's what everyone thought.

38:09.966 --> 38:12.217
We're trying to figure out
how his plane got there.

38:12.268 --> 38:13.902
There's... Something else.

38:15.805 --> 38:19.808
Sean's body, it's... It's missing.

38:19.810 --> 38:23.144
Wes, what are you saying?

38:23.146 --> 38:25.814
I'm saying Sean Bennigan can
no longer be presumed deceased.

38:25.865 --> 38:27.315
He's now considered missing.

38:31.821 --> 38:33.822
Wes!

38:33.824 --> 38:36.658
I have the secretary on the line for you!

38:36.660 --> 38:38.326
- Claire, I have to call you back.
- No!

38:38.328 --> 38:40.378
No, Wes... Wes, don't hang up.

38:40.413 --> 38:41.713
Please, I don't understand.
You need to explain.

38:41.747 --> 38:42.797
- I don't un...
- I'm sorry.

38:42.832 --> 38:44.632
I have to go.

39:09.025 --> 39:11.326
uh, uh...

39:29.094 --> 39:32.213
So, Wes, what in the hell am I looking at?

39:32.264 --> 39:34.215
A fulgurite.

39:34.266 --> 39:36.584
Sometimes known as "petrified lightning."

39:36.618 --> 39:39.053
It happens when large bursts
of energy hit the sand.

39:39.104 --> 39:40.888
And you thought it was necessary
to pull me out of a meeting...

39:40.939 --> 39:43.524
Sir, this is what
a traditional sample looks like.

39:45.477 --> 39:47.945
And this is what we found
at the crash site.

39:50.149 --> 39:51.783
So the heat from
the plane's impact created...

39:51.817 --> 39:53.951
No, I had my team run that scenario.

39:53.986 --> 39:55.754
There's, uh, nowhere near enough
energy to make that happen.

39:55.834 --> 39:57.955
- So what do you propose did?
- I don't know.

39:57.990 --> 40:00.375
A weapons test from a rogue state.

40:00.439 --> 40:02.777
The locals, n... No one's talking,
no one saw anything?

40:02.811 --> 40:06.047
Well, I believe someone did.

40:06.081 --> 40:07.131
Well, who?

40:07.216 --> 40:08.799
Whoever left these.

40:12.838 --> 40:14.972
How could anyone have survived that crash?

40:15.007 --> 40:16.674
I agree, sir.

40:16.725 --> 40:17.975
But I'd like to stay and run some tests

40:18.010 --> 40:19.894
on Captain Bennigan's plane.

40:23.682 --> 40:25.499
Come home, Wes.

40:27.519 --> 40:29.987
- But, sir...
- That's an order.

40:30.021 --> 40:32.323
Come home.

40:32.357 --> 40:35.493
There's something you need to know.

40:51.993 --> 40:53.794
I can't believe it.

40:56.164 --> 40:59.800
This is the best present
in the whole wide world.

40:59.835 --> 41:02.803
Thank you for fixing me.

41:06.309 --> 41:08.309
Okay.

41:08.311 --> 41:10.811
I promise.

41:10.813 --> 41:13.814
It'll be our little secret.

41:17.369 --> 41:19.653
Goodnight, Drill.

41:19.704 --> 41:21.322
I love you.
