00:23.005 --> 00:23.839
It's Trice's lieutenant.

00:23.839 --> 00:26.463
Reg, yeah, I heard of him.

00:26.463 --> 00:27.422
So what are they running
out of there?

00:27.422 --> 00:29.714
Guess we just gonna have

00:36.171 --> 00:37.296
Did you go to the cops?

00:37.296 --> 00:39.213
- I can't.

00:39.213 --> 00:40.922
'Cause he might be dead.
I might have helped kill him.

00:40.922 --> 00:42.839
Excuse me!

00:42.839 --> 00:44.588
I think it's best
you leave the party.

00:44.588 --> 00:46.714
Why you watching us,
old man?

00:46.714 --> 00:49.005
I'm just enjoying the view

00:49.005 --> 00:50.964
I could fix that shit
right now.

00:50.964 --> 00:51.922
You'd be dead before
I hit the ground.

00:51.922 --> 00:54.714
- Dude who killed Coogie.

00:54.714 --> 00:56.922
He sure ain't dead, man.

00:56.922 --> 00:58.338

00:58.338 --> 01:00.463

01:21.296 --> 01:22.380
I ain't fucking

01:22.380 --> 01:26.255

01:42.338 --> 01:44.213

01:52.046 --> 01:54.130
Look who's still here, Laverne.

01:54.130 --> 01:56.296
Yeah.

01:56.296 --> 01:59.171
And you can't sell this house
without my signature.

01:59.171 --> 02:02.088

If you want coffee, fine.

02:02.088 --> 02:05.213

man classes, Laverne.

02:05.213 --> 02:07.296

02:25.046 --> 02:29.296
We went down to the courthouse
and we got it done right.

02:29.296 --> 02:31.046
