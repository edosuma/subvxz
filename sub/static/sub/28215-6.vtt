00:10.681 --> 00:13.001
Crazy news week, am I right?

00:13.860 --> 00:16.006
Can't say I didn't see that one coming!

00:16.589 --> 00:17.858
Morning, Melvin.

00:17.883 --> 00:20.428
Oh, hey, sorry I got
your car towed last week.

00:20.453 --> 00:22.778
You know, but one inch
into the driveway...

00:22.803 --> 00:24.345
rules are rules.

00:25.655 --> 00:27.349
Your veins look weird today, buddy.

00:27.374 --> 00:28.790
Uh-huh.

00:30.881 --> 00:32.705
Oh, oh!

00:32.729 --> 00:34.540
That must be Gerty's!

00:34.565 --> 00:36.596
You good little dog, yes.

00:37.620 --> 00:39.710
Thanks for picking it up for me.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.149
Yeah.

Hey, Lynette. Hey.

01:04.870 --> 01:06.185
How are you?

01:06.210 --> 01:07.770
Can't say I didn't see that one coming.

01:07.794 --> 01:09.211
Oh, yeah.

01:09.236 --> 01:10.570
Funny stuff. Yeah, funny stuff.

01:10.610 --> 01:13.126
Hey, so, um, that was
really fun the other night.

01:13.151 --> 01:14.861
Uh, you want to hang out again sometime?

01:14.886 --> 01:15.956
Maybe as a date?

01:16.440 --> 01:18.140
Uh...

01:18.180 --> 01:19.270
A pause is worrisome.

01:19.310 --> 01:21.400
Yeah, I just... I don't know, Jack.

01:21.450 --> 01:22.930
I don't think we're a good fit.

01:23.437 --> 01:26.320
You hate Toledo, and I'm here to stay.

01:26.566 --> 01:28.606
Only four more payments
left on my grave plot, so...

01:28.630 --> 01:29.710
Ooh, well, that's exciting.

01:29.734 --> 01:31.014
I'd like to see that grave plot.

01:31.038 --> 01:33.117
Maybe... maybe with
some wine and cheese?

01:33.142 --> 01:35.641
No, no, that's a date.

01:35.666 --> 01:37.087
- Ah.
- Perfect date.

01:37.447 --> 01:40.095
And we can't do that,
but maybe... maybe...

01:40.990 --> 01:42.640
we could hang out as friends.

01:42.665 --> 01:46.404
Though I do worry hanging out is
a gateway drug to harder stuff.

01:46.429 --> 01:48.702
Oh, no, no, no, no. A
hangout, that's perfect.

01:49.018 --> 01:50.046
Yeah, I... you know what?

01:50.071 --> 01:51.641
I'm gonna plan an amazing hangout.

01:51.666 --> 01:53.931
It's gonna be so great,
and you're gonna laugh

01:53.956 --> 01:55.564
that you were ever even worried, okay?

01:55.589 --> 01:58.197
A big, wheezy, deep, guttural,

01:58.338 --> 02:00.118
Dom DeLuise-style laugh.

02:00.158 --> 02:02.598
All right. See ya.

02:04.834 --> 02:07.863
Yes, I agree, Randy, a picture
is worth a thousand words.

02:07.888 --> 02:10.158
But is it worth a thousand dollars?

02:10.184 --> 02:12.614
No, Randy, Randy, we don't
have it in the budget.

02:13.048 --> 02:15.276
Oh, okay, joke's on you.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.901
I would love to be screwed.

02:20.658 --> 02:22.138
- Helen?
- Huh?

02:22.163 --> 02:24.069
Randy, our yearbook photographer,

02:24.094 --> 02:26.834
has decided to raise his rates.

02:26.859 --> 02:28.179
Yearbook pictures start tomorrow.

02:28.203 --> 02:30.293
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna have to fix it.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.552
You know, it's a great
break for the ugly kids,

02:32.577 --> 02:34.927
but the pretty kids are gonna be mad.

02:36.940 --> 02:39.160
All right, shut up.

02:39.185 --> 02:40.785
Now, I'm gonna ask
you guys for something

02:40.809 --> 02:43.701
that I feel almost certain
doesn't actually exist...

02:44.056 --> 02:45.886
fun things to do in Toledo.

02:45.889 --> 02:47.579
It's for a potential
hangout with Lynette.

02:47.604 --> 02:49.757
- So like a date?
- Excellent riddle, troll.

02:49.782 --> 02:52.482
It is like a date, but it is not a date.

02:52.648 --> 02:54.652
It's just a, you know, fun, friendly,

02:54.677 --> 02:57.675
and, uh, potentially
flirty... at most... hangout.

02:58.128 --> 03:00.730
They do tableside pasta
at Spaghetti Warehouse.

03:01.048 --> 03:02.643
You get to see them boil it.

03:03.681 --> 03:05.217
All right, please no restaurants

03:05.242 --> 03:07.664
with the word "warehouse" or "factory"

03:07.689 --> 03:09.109
or "mill" in the name,

03:12.166 --> 03:15.211
You could split a pad
Thai and a sparkling wine.

03:15.408 --> 03:17.278
That's what I do with
my college girlfriend.

03:17.303 --> 03:20.303
Mm, I wouldn't call
the soft inner lining

03:20.328 --> 03:22.208
of a Duke sweatshirt a girlfriend.

03:23.868 --> 03:26.434
Oh, nothing gets my
father's whore revved up

03:26.459 --> 03:28.029
like a night at the dog track.

03:28.248 --> 03:30.501
We still calling her a whore
even though they're engaged?

03:30.526 --> 03:31.688
Yeah.

03:31.713 --> 03:35.658
Did you know Toledo's revitalized
riverfront is for lovers?

03:36.665 --> 03:38.198
Next person caught quoting

03:38.223 --> 03:39.923
the Toledo tourism board gets an F.

03:40.088 --> 03:41.673
Come on, guys, think.

03:43.268 --> 03:45.606
We went out one time,

03:45.631 --> 03:47.505
and now this clown
won't stop texting me.

03:47.530 --> 03:49.970
- Ugh, look at this.
- Let me see.

03:49.995 --> 03:51.481
Oh, wait a minute.

03:52.318 --> 03:54.780
Oh. Oh, you meant,
like, a literal clown.

03:54.805 --> 03:55.601
Mm.

03:55.626 --> 03:57.338
Like a children's entertainer.

03:58.798 --> 04:00.448
You're dating Garbanzo?

04:00.473 --> 04:02.553
- It's not dating.
- Lucky duck!

04:02.578 --> 04:05.008
Oh, he's hilarious.

04:05.147 --> 04:06.927
Keith and I hired him
for our anniversary.

04:06.952 --> 04:08.487
He's a cute clown, girl.

04:08.512 --> 04:10.188
Good morning, ladies.

04:10.213 --> 04:11.563
Let me ask you a question.

04:11.588 --> 04:16.063
Would you hire this photographer
to take the yearbook photos?

04:16.088 --> 04:17.457
- Ooh!
- Wow!

04:17.482 --> 04:19.242
Okay, well, get ready for a shock,

04:19.267 --> 04:22.212
because this guy...

04:22.853 --> 04:23.946
is free.

04:25.178 --> 04:26.579
Uh, Ralph?

04:26.604 --> 04:27.713
Oh, hang on.

04:28.470 --> 04:29.496
It's me.

04:29.521 --> 04:31.295
Durbs.

04:31.320 --> 04:34.414
Well, it looks like we have
a new yearbook photographer.

04:34.439 --> 04:36.432
- Yes.
- Then I says to the guy,

04:36.457 --> 04:39.030
"It's an '04 Corolla, okay?

04:39.055 --> 04:40.975
"I don't need the fancy oil.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.610
"Besides, alls I got is $20,

04:43.808 --> 04:46.288
so alls you're gonna get is $20".

04:46.328 --> 04:48.198
- Hey, Lynette.
- Hey.

04:48.238 --> 04:49.935
So our hangout, okay?

04:49.960 --> 04:51.960
I was thinking we'd go
classic. You ready for this?

04:52.198 --> 04:53.758
All right, we start with a wine tasting

04:53.782 --> 04:55.612
and then a prix fixe dinner,

04:55.733 --> 04:58.083
and then I take you to
the Cleveland Symphony.

04:58.670 --> 05:01.521
- Okay, that all sounds pretty date-y.
- Yeah.

05:01.546 --> 05:05.623
I think we should watch a
very, very unromantic movie,

05:06.178 --> 05:07.928
like "John Wick 2".

05:07.953 --> 05:08.993
Mm.

05:09.773 --> 05:11.496
Will I be lost if I
haven't seen part one?

05:12.036 --> 05:13.871
Do you know how guns work?

05:15.162 --> 05:17.642
This guy says, "Look,
what's the difference of $4?

05:17.667 --> 05:19.762
I says, "What's the difference of $4?

05:19.787 --> 05:23.143
That's a coffee. That's a candy
bar". You know what I mean?

05:23.168 --> 05:26.213
It's like, don't make me
list things that $4 will buy.

05:26.238 --> 05:28.758
'Cause you know what?
I got a million of 'em.

05:36.338 --> 05:38.473
Hey, jackwad.

05:41.818 --> 05:46.168
UPS said they delivered my
Garrett's popcorn yesterday.

05:47.428 --> 05:50.258
Did you touch my Garrett's?

05:50.283 --> 05:52.550
Maybe look in the garbage
bin where you chucked

05:52.575 --> 05:55.535
my Castelvetrano olive

Yeah, my mom loved that one.

06:32.689 --> 06:35.668
She said it was the closest
thing to a video of Jesus.

06:36.855 --> 06:37.985
She had great taste.

06:39.000 --> 06:40.194
I love everything in here.

06:40.219 --> 06:42.625

you are gonna love the basement.

06:45.358 --> 06:47.848
Wow, that came out so much
creepier than I thought it would.

06:48.280 --> 06:49.960
I would like to see
your basement sometime.

06:49.984 --> 06:51.633
Whoa, slow down, Lynette. Slow down.

06:51.658 --> 06:53.731
All right...

06:53.756 --> 06:55.549
Here we go.

07:10.934 --> 07:12.301
Just gonna pause it for a second.

07:22.658 --> 07:24.398
Would you excuse me for a minute?

07:24.438 --> 07:26.358
I got to take care of something.

07:26.398 --> 07:27.478
Sure.

07:30.482 --> 07:32.488
Just looking at the stars,

07:32.513 --> 07:34.058
eating some olives,

07:35.148 --> 07:37.148
testing the old car alarm.

07:37.173 --> 07:40.000
Hey, Melvin, I think you
dropped something, bud.

07:40.025 --> 07:41.325
Hey, Jack?

07:41.498 --> 07:42.641
Are you about to throw poop

07:42.666 --> 07:44.666
at that elderly man and his dog?

07:46.272 --> 07:47.333
Uh...

07:58.288 --> 07:59.537
Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

07:59.562 --> 08:02.773
I... look, I was... I wasn't
gonna throw it at him.

08:02.798 --> 08:04.361
I-I was just gonna, you know,

08:04.386 --> 08:05.837
kind of push it into his chest.

08:05.862 --> 08:07.993
Look, if this guy's making
your life miserable,

08:08.018 --> 08:10.742
putting dog poop on his jacket
isn't gonna solve anything.

08:10.767 --> 08:13.192
Revenge isn't for everybody,
but it has its merits.

08:13.217 --> 08:16.127
Right, which is why you
wait until he's asleep,

08:16.214 --> 08:18.094
then slide it through his mail slot.

08:19.038 --> 08:20.178
Dog poop on the carpet?

08:20.203 --> 08:22.009
Now, that is a steam cleaning

08:22.034 --> 08:24.294
and three days with the
windows open, at least.

08:24.438 --> 08:27.044
Wow, I got to tell you...

08:27.608 --> 08:30.008
that is the hottest thing
any woman's ever said to me.

08:30.033 --> 08:31.163
You're welcome.

08:31.188 --> 08:32.388
Okay, Helen.

08:32.412 --> 08:35.155
- Hit me with the wind and the tunes.
- Yes.

08:36.924 --> 08:38.220
All right, all right.

08:38.245 --> 08:40.203
Okay, Victor, let's
go on a little journey.

08:40.227 --> 08:41.812
All right, here we go.

08:41.837 --> 08:43.383
Yeah, okay.

08:43.408 --> 08:45.872
Find your wind. Find your wind.

08:45.897 --> 08:48.645
Find the wind. Okay,
that's... look away.

08:48.670 --> 08:50.060
Look away and then look back!

08:50.085 --> 08:51.575
Yeah, look away again. Look away.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.430
Look back! Oh, nice.

08:53.455 --> 08:55.664
Okay, now climb up on
the chair and jump at me.

08:55.689 --> 08:58.673
And a little jump. And now
ready? Okay, scream, scream!

09:00.472 --> 09:02.482
♪ She was pure like snowflakes ♪

09:02.507 --> 09:03.857
This isn't working.

09:05.517 --> 09:07.982
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry, be good.

09:13.203 --> 09:15.375
I hate this new mop.

09:15.400 --> 09:17.560
I can't believe you threw my
favorite one in the trash.

09:17.584 --> 09:18.946
Are we still on this, Dale?

09:18.971 --> 09:21.293
Life's too short for me to
talk about a mop this much.

09:21.490 --> 09:22.513
You're right.

09:22.733 --> 09:24.473
But just a couple more
things about my...

09:24.498 --> 09:26.247
Oh, know what I just remembered?

09:26.758 --> 09:28.588
I actually put your
mop in a magic Dumpster

09:28.628 --> 09:30.458
because I knew you loved it so much,

09:30.483 --> 09:32.123
and whatever you put
in the magic Dumpster

09:32.147 --> 09:34.440
comes back as something
else even better.

09:34.465 --> 09:37.855
But talking about it too
much can hurt the magic.

09:38.468 --> 09:39.931
Okay.

09:39.956 --> 09:41.533
Why didn't you say this five days ago?

09:41.558 --> 09:43.946
Thank you.

09:44.274 --> 09:45.364
Now we wait.

09:47.428 --> 09:49.272
I got to go back to computer school.

09:51.388 --> 09:54.373
Can a... can a sulking failure sit here?

09:54.526 --> 09:56.088
I already told Dave he could.

09:59.503 --> 10:02.113
I genuinely can't tell
if we're friends or not.

10:02.138 --> 10:04.968
Oh, Dave.

10:04.993 --> 10:06.724
What's the matter, Durbs?

10:07.538 --> 10:09.209
Kids didn't like my pictures.

10:09.234 --> 10:10.596
I tried to do something different.

10:10.621 --> 10:12.603
I tried to add a little sauce,

10:12.628 --> 10:14.685
but apparently nobody wants that.

10:14.710 --> 10:17.548
Oh, don't let kids
determine your self-worth.

10:17.573 --> 10:19.115
Yeah, let us do that.

10:19.140 --> 10:21.393
Yeah, Ralph, sauce up our pictures.

10:21.418 --> 10:22.768
- Yeah!
- Yeah, Ralph!

10:22.793 --> 10:24.221
- Sauce us.
- Yeah, all right.

10:24.246 --> 10:25.252
Okay.

10:25.277 --> 10:27.823
Mary, I want you to fling the
paint at the canvas, all right?

10:27.848 --> 10:30.089
You're Jackson Pollock
with a little bit of lion.

10:30.478 --> 10:32.034
Fling the paint, Mary.

10:32.059 --> 10:33.568
Fling it. Now you're all lion!

10:33.593 --> 10:35.956
You get in here, you mean old lion!

10:35.981 --> 10:38.098
Okay, Stef, now, you're
Marie Antoinette, all right?

10:38.123 --> 10:39.733
Let you eat cake.

10:39.758 --> 10:41.032
- Yes, yes.
- Let yourself.

10:41.057 --> 10:42.262
There you go, yes.

10:42.279 --> 10:44.039
Now tear into that cake
with your bare hands!

10:44.063 --> 10:46.373
- Don't mind if I do.
- No, no, Helen.

10:46.398 --> 10:47.827
No, Helen!

10:47.852 --> 10:49.122
Become a brush.

10:49.147 --> 10:50.887
Oh, yes.

10:50.912 --> 10:53.020
Now... now smash that cake. Smash it.

10:54.058 --> 10:55.340
Yes, queen!

10:57.148 --> 10:58.426
Ooh, attack the canvas.

10:59.225 --> 11:01.448
Beautiful! Yes!

11:01.473 --> 11:03.428
Oh, I wasn't ready for that. Yes.

11:03.453 --> 11:05.273
Oh, the lens is melted. The lens melted.

11:05.298 --> 11:06.682
Filthy!

11:06.707 --> 11:08.587
Oh, oh.

11:08.789 --> 11:10.879
Uh, okay, let's, uh...

11:11.208 --> 11:12.778
let's tone it down a little bit there.

11:12.818 --> 11:14.894
Maybe a little... maybe
a little less sexy.

11:14.919 --> 11:16.399
School's still in session, so...

11:16.424 --> 11:18.164
Ooh, jeez.

11:18.189 --> 11:20.059
Okay, come on.

11:20.200 --> 11:23.120
And I says, "Listen, buddy,
if I walk into a restaurant

11:23.145 --> 11:24.680
and I order a grilled cheese

11:24.705 --> 11:26.485
and you bring me a steak on the side

11:26.510 --> 11:28.730
that I didn't ask for,
do I got to pay for it?"

11:28.838 --> 11:30.538
He said, "Depends on the restaurant".

11:30.578 --> 11:32.098
I says, "No, it doesn't.

11:32.123 --> 11:33.924
You can't give me something
I didn't ask for".

11:33.948 --> 11:34.537
Hey, hey.

11:34.670 --> 11:35.685
Hey.

11:35.710 --> 11:39.643
So... your little mail-slot
plan worked perfectly.

11:39.668 --> 11:42.548
I'm talking poopy
footprints inside and out.

11:42.573 --> 11:44.493
It was a mess... beautiful stuff.

11:44.518 --> 11:45.791
Problem solved.

11:45.816 --> 11:48.345
- Well...
- See, this dynamic works.

11:48.598 --> 11:50.062
We're not dating. We're just

11:50.087 --> 11:51.975
helping each other destroy old men.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.573
Well, not so fast, because
Melvin struck back.

11:54.598 --> 11:57.428
It appears he sawed a
small tree down in my yard.

11:57.468 --> 11:59.868
Very quiet sawing. It must
have taken him hours.

11:59.908 --> 12:01.415
- Wow, this guy's good.
- Mm-hmm.

12:01.440 --> 12:02.486
You need to strike at his heart.

12:02.510 --> 12:04.022
Yeah, but the guy's so miserable.

12:04.047 --> 12:05.787
I mean, what's something
he actually loves?

12:09.378 --> 12:11.338
Kidnap his dog.

12:11.363 --> 12:14.453
She gets it.

12:22.408 --> 12:24.448
Damn, who's this beefcake?

12:24.488 --> 12:26.083
- Is that your dad?
- That's not my dad.

12:26.716 --> 12:28.297
Okay. All right, guys, that's enough.

12:28.322 --> 12:29.962
Bring it in, okay?
Let's review the plans.

12:30.068 --> 12:32.741
So you Scouts are gonna distract Melvin

12:32.766 --> 12:34.313
with your magazine-selling routine.

12:34.338 --> 12:38.282
Uh, technically, I'm the only
one here who's a real Scout.

12:38.307 --> 12:40.147
- Well, this one's a dud.
- Oh, yeah, he sucks.

12:40.172 --> 12:41.612
Uh, Grace, you got that ransom note?

12:41.636 --> 12:42.888
- Yep.
- Okay, great.

12:43.406 --> 12:45.286
Whoa, that... that really
looks like real blood.

12:45.310 --> 12:47.010
Please don't tell me
whether it is or not.

12:47.161 --> 12:48.161
It is.

12:48.998 --> 12:51.118
It is? All right, well, don't
tell me where it's from.

12:51.142 --> 12:52.142
My hamster.

12:53.478 --> 12:54.788
All right, moving on.

12:55.070 --> 12:56.586
I brought my camping stove

12:56.611 --> 12:59.804
so we can lure our canine
friend with the aroma of meat.

13:00.528 --> 13:03.622
Who knows? I may sneak
a sniff or two myself.

13:03.647 --> 13:05.901
Okay, Vic. Yeah, sniff away, sniff away.

13:05.926 --> 13:07.766
Anthony, you'll grab the
dog and bring it back.

13:07.790 --> 13:09.228
Yes, hunty.

13:09.278 --> 13:12.648
All right, guys, let's, uh...
let's break this old man.

13:12.673 --> 13:13.798
Yeah.

13:13.823 --> 13:14.935
Get to it.

13:24.078 --> 13:25.948
Come on, let's go.

13:29.554 --> 13:32.070
We're selling magazines,
sir. What's your pleasure?

13:32.095 --> 13:34.327
Politics, hunting, celebrity "goss"?

13:34.958 --> 13:36.568
Salesmen, huh?

13:36.608 --> 13:38.128
Salespersons.

13:38.497 --> 13:39.614
Sweetie...

13:40.218 --> 13:42.601
I was a door-to-door salesman

13:42.626 --> 13:45.858
before your parents were even smooching.

13:45.883 --> 13:47.453
- That's very cool.
- You don't say?

13:47.658 --> 13:50.918
Spoon sets was my game.

13:52.058 --> 13:54.278
Wow, Vic really loves
that steak, doesn't he?

13:54.318 --> 13:56.358
He looks like he's trying
to inhale the whole thing.

13:56.487 --> 13:57.997
Come on, man. Leave
some sniffs for the dog.

13:58.021 --> 13:59.661
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, seriously.

13:59.685 --> 14:01.205
- Oh, my God, here they come.
- Yep.

14:01.628 --> 14:04.224
Oh, Anthony, come on.
Would you hurry it up?

14:04.249 --> 14:05.485
Yeah, that guy's got one gear.

14:05.510 --> 14:06.950
- Seriously.
- Here we go.

14:06.975 --> 14:08.583
Now all we got to do

14:08.608 --> 14:10.848
is wait for Melvin to call
the number on the ransom note,

14:10.872 --> 14:12.152
which goes to this burner phone.

14:12.176 --> 14:14.944
- Yes. Give it to me. Give it to me.
- That was so fun!

14:18.981 --> 14:21.262
- Morning, Helen.
- Good morning.

14:21.287 --> 14:24.193
I want to thank Mary, Stef,
and Michelle for yesterday,

14:24.218 --> 14:26.218
so could you send them
each a bottle of champagne?

14:26.243 --> 14:28.153
Oh, I don't know how to do that.

14:28.178 --> 14:29.223
Yeah, me neither.

14:29.492 --> 14:31.182
Champagne problems, am I right?

14:31.207 --> 14:33.223
Wait, is that what that means?

14:33.248 --> 14:35.168
- I don't know.
- Me neither.

14:36.058 --> 14:38.148
Anyway, I can't wait to get my, uh,

14:38.626 --> 14:40.712
snapping finger to work, so, uh...

14:41.628 --> 14:44.681
Listen, Ralph, we only
got through one student

14:44.706 --> 14:46.096
and three teachers yesterday,

14:46.243 --> 14:48.299
and if we don't get everyone
else finished today,

14:48.324 --> 14:50.564
we're gonna spend more money
on that equipment and lights

14:50.588 --> 14:52.658
than we would have if we
would have hired Randy.

14:52.683 --> 14:53.713
Okay.

14:54.433 --> 14:57.083
I'll just have to shoot the
rest of the students today.

14:57.108 --> 14:59.458
- That's right.
- Champagne problems.

14:59.515 --> 15:00.605
Is that it?

15:00.630 --> 15:02.420
- I-I don't know.
- Yeah, me neither.

15:02.445 --> 15:03.445
No.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.959
It's fun to wonder.

15:08.958 --> 15:10.918
Where you going, huh?

15:11.099 --> 15:12.579
Where you going, girl?

15:12.603 --> 15:13.919
Okay... hey, come on.

15:14.273 --> 15:16.323
- Good girl, good girl.
- Hey, Jack.

15:18.113 --> 15:19.113
Yeah?

15:22.278 --> 15:24.124
Pretty sure we both know
what's going on here.

15:24.148 --> 15:25.835
That's not your dog.

15:26.858 --> 15:28.338
And I know how you got it.

15:29.678 --> 15:32.240
That dog is my mop.

15:32.537 --> 15:34.451
You got it from the magic Dumpster.

15:35.638 --> 15:37.248
I'm sorry.

15:37.298 --> 15:39.468
Wow, I really thought that
was going somewhere else.

15:39.493 --> 15:41.493
Did you just say this dog is your mop?

15:41.518 --> 15:43.206
- That I did, old friend.
- Hmm.

15:43.231 --> 15:45.341
I'm gonna have to take
that sweet little one back.

15:45.366 --> 15:46.646
I'm gonna give her a great life.

15:47.648 --> 15:48.698
Okay.

15:50.438 --> 15:52.768
I'm gonna get my mop
back, you dog thief!

15:55.618 --> 15:58.016
Come on, girl. Come on, girl.

15:58.041 --> 15:59.398
Yeah, come on, girl.

15:59.448 --> 16:01.000
Who's a good girl? Who's a good...

16:01.025 --> 16:02.285
All right, everyone shut up.

16:02.310 --> 16:03.750
Everybody just go ahead and shut up.

16:04.024 --> 16:05.324
You still have the dog?

16:05.988 --> 16:07.858
Oh, yeah, Melvin hasn't called yet.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.261
He hasn't called yet?

16:09.286 --> 16:11.606
What do you get by repeating
what I just said, Marcus, huh?

16:11.630 --> 16:14.030
- Who does it help?
- This guy is stone cold.

16:14.638 --> 16:16.002
He's trying to outlast us.

16:16.027 --> 16:17.467
- You think?
- I think so.

16:17.492 --> 16:20.117
You know what? I say we cut
the cloak-and-dagger crap.

16:20.142 --> 16:21.622
I say we go bang on his door,

16:21.647 --> 16:23.247
and we tell him if he
wants his dog back,

16:23.271 --> 16:24.658
he's got to accept our truce.

16:24.807 --> 16:27.533
Or we wait until he gets a new dog

16:27.558 --> 16:30.388
and then replace that dog with this dog

16:30.413 --> 16:32.233
and then watch him go insane.

16:32.258 --> 16:34.128
He's gonna lose his mind.

16:34.153 --> 16:35.913
- Oh, it'd be so crazy.
- That's really good.

16:35.937 --> 16:37.374
Yeah, yeah.

16:41.164 --> 16:42.764
Okay, we got 100 kids left to photograph

16:42.788 --> 16:44.764
- and 15 minutes to do it. Let's go.
- Okay.

16:44.789 --> 16:45.984
Listen up, kiddos.

16:46.009 --> 16:49.359
Have your smiles prepped
before you go into the frame.

16:49.933 --> 16:51.639
Think of something
that makes you happy...

16:51.664 --> 16:54.620
like puppies for me, Nana's brisket,

16:54.645 --> 16:56.288
that chubby little kid from "Up".

16:56.313 --> 16:58.233
- Get in and get out.
- Great, next.

16:58.258 --> 17:00.098
Uh, I was hoping to try
one without my glasses.

17:00.122 --> 17:02.929
- Too late, next.
- Nope! Go, go, go.

17:02.954 --> 17:05.459
- Uh, where should I look?
- Wrong way, next.

17:05.483 --> 17:06.786
Come on, pretend you're on fire.

17:06.810 --> 17:07.958
Don't milk it.

17:08.936 --> 17:10.281
- Cheese, yo.
- Already took it.

17:10.306 --> 17:11.507
- Next.
- Keep moving.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.249
Don't stop to pose, walk sideways.

17:13.273 --> 17:15.717
- Go, go, go.
- There you go.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.382
- Perfect, nice!
- Pretend there's a fire!

17:17.406 --> 17:18.464
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:18.489 --> 17:19.809
All right, boom, getting it done.

17:19.833 --> 17:21.153
Getting it done, getting it done.

17:21.176 --> 17:22.185
Yeah!

17:22.880 --> 17:24.540
Oh, God.

17:24.565 --> 17:26.395
Okay.

17:26.709 --> 17:29.006
- We got to take full advantage of this.
- Mm-hmm.

17:29.031 --> 17:30.641
Maybe we can get a TV out of him.

17:30.666 --> 17:33.806
Got to say... this has been a
really fun series of hangouts.

17:33.831 --> 17:34.837
Yeah.

17:34.862 --> 17:37.702
Yeah, I can't believe I was worried
that it would lead to something bad.

17:37.726 --> 17:38.726
Yeah.

17:42.198 --> 17:44.768
Hey, is there something
happening with Melvin?

17:44.808 --> 17:46.191
No, why?

17:46.282 --> 17:47.672
I mean, he died earlier,

17:47.697 --> 17:49.147
but nothing's happened since then.

17:50.208 --> 17:51.558
Oh, man.

17:53.244 --> 17:54.274
We won.

17:56.547 --> 17:58.617
We won so hard, we killed an old man.

18:08.776 --> 18:10.800
I thought we might be a bad fit.

18:11.102 --> 18:12.966
Then we hung out, egged each other on,

18:12.991 --> 18:14.802
and caused an old man to die.

18:15.758 --> 18:17.685
We are definitely a bad fit.

18:19.848 --> 18:20.938
Excuse me?

18:20.963 --> 18:22.486
Sorry, this might sound crazy,

18:22.511 --> 18:24.731
but did Melvin die of a broken heart?

18:25.328 --> 18:27.938
You know, 'cause he...
he missed his dog so much?

18:27.978 --> 18:30.105
"A broken heart"? What?

18:30.130 --> 18:32.511
No, no, the old man
choked on a chicken wing.

18:32.894 --> 18:35.956
Always remember to chew
your food until it's a fine paste.

18:35.981 --> 18:37.497
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks for the tip.

18:37.522 --> 18:38.942
Go ahead and move along there, pal.

18:40.348 --> 18:42.168
Did you hear that?

18:42.193 --> 18:43.753
- Yeah!
- He choked. We didn't kill him!

18:43.777 --> 18:45.012
We didn't kill him! He choked!

18:45.037 --> 18:47.297
Oh...

18:49.348 --> 18:51.048
Sorry to interrupt your fun,

18:51.088 --> 18:53.699
uh, but the Humane Society's
on its way to pick up that dog,

18:53.724 --> 18:55.503
since Melvin didn't leave her to anyone.

18:55.528 --> 18:57.306
So if you could just hand it over...

18:58.499 --> 19:00.619
Actually, you know what?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

19:00.643 --> 19:01.900
Call them off.

19:03.054 --> 19:05.624
I know someone who'd be
thrilled to take her in.

19:07.374 --> 19:08.853
Come on, girl.

19:09.016 --> 19:11.716
Hey, Dale, got something for you, bud.

19:12.118 --> 19:13.678
I really wish people would stop

19:13.702 --> 19:15.442
saying that to me before they pooped.

19:15.468 --> 19:16.784
But... what?

19:16.809 --> 19:18.459
No, I-I'm talking about the dog, man.

19:18.484 --> 19:19.624
Look, the dog.

19:19.675 --> 19:21.245
I-I can tell she means a lot to you,

19:21.558 --> 19:24.348
you know, based on
some unsettling belief

19:24.388 --> 19:25.737
in the... in the supernatural

19:25.762 --> 19:28.462
or just a deep misunderstanding
of science, you know.

19:28.487 --> 19:31.924
But regardless, I know you'll give
her a better life than I could.

19:32.398 --> 19:34.088
Moppy!

19:34.113 --> 19:35.463
I'm so happy.

19:35.568 --> 19:37.662
I'm gonna find a way
to turn you back, girl.

19:37.687 --> 19:40.037
I am gonna find a way to turn you back.

19:40.062 --> 19:42.763
Yes, yes!

19:44.408 --> 19:45.575
It's open. Come in.

19:46.162 --> 19:47.739
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.183
- Vino.
- "Expendables 3".

19:50.208 --> 19:51.356
Ooh!

19:51.381 --> 19:53.214
Now, does it matter that I
haven't seen the first two?

19:53.238 --> 19:54.478
You remember how the guns work?

19:54.502 --> 19:55.498
- Yep.
- You'll be good.

19:55.523 --> 19:56.537
Okay.

19:56.562 --> 19:58.573
Oh, and this was sitting on your steps.

19:58.598 --> 19:59.678
Oh.

20:00.428 --> 20:03.378
It's from... it's from Melvin's estate.

20:05.165 --> 20:07.738
"Jack Griffin, if you're
reading this, I've passed.

20:08.428 --> 20:11.192
Here's the key your mother
gave me to water her plants.

20:11.868 --> 20:14.291
I'd like to thank you for
the tête-à-tête we've had.

20:15.138 --> 20:18.373
It's made me feel more alive".

20:18.398 --> 20:20.438
"And you should know each
day when you went to work,

20:20.462 --> 20:21.645
I let myself in and...

20:23.138 --> 20:25.278
and put my bare butt
on your throw pillows".

20:25.318 --> 20:27.278
Signed, Melvin Grask.

20:27.664 --> 20:28.875
Well, what do you know?

20:29.448 --> 20:31.922
We were able to add
meaning to the man's life.

20:32.916 --> 20:34.076
- To Melvin.
- Yeah.

20:34.743 --> 20:35.852
To Melvin.

20:37.588 --> 20:38.610
Hmm.

20:39.288 --> 20:41.598
Ahh.

20:44.378 --> 20:46.485
I've taken a lot of
naps on those pillows.

20:46.510 --> 20:47.598
Have you?

20:47.623 --> 20:49.223
I'd like to throw them in the trash now.

20:49.247 --> 20:51.037
- Can we burn them?
- Yeah.

20:53.998 --> 20:56.274
Got a little more magic
left in you, Mr. Dumpster?

20:57.784 --> 20:59.364
I wish for a son.

21:14.458 --> 21:15.638
Thank you.

21:18.368 --> 21:19.992
Come on, Moppy, let's go.

21:20.678 --> 21:21.812
Yeah.
