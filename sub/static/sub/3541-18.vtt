<i>Previously on</i> Vampire Diaries:

00:03.836 --> 00:06.032
- You must be Elena.
- How do we look exactly alike?

00:06.206 --> 00:08.697
You're a doppelganger,
the key to breaking the curse.

00:08.875 --> 00:10.001
Sun and the moon curse?

00:10.176 --> 00:12.144
- Klaus is real.
- First generation vampire.

00:12.312 --> 00:15.509
The oldest vampire in the history
of time is coming after me?

00:15.682 --> 00:17.707
- Elijah.
- One of the Originals, a legend.

00:19.085 --> 00:21.918
That's it. As long as we keep
the dagger there, he stays dead.

00:22.088 --> 00:24.249
Elijah had no weapon to kill Klaus.

00:24.424 --> 00:28.190
He believed that if a witch could channel
enough power, it wouldn't need one.

00:28.361 --> 00:31.159
Like the power you get
from a hundred dead witches.

00:31.331 --> 00:33.697
Says if you use too much powers,
it'll kill you.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.427
- How much to kill an Original?
- All of it.

00:36.603 --> 00:38.366
- I'm a vampire.
- I don't wanna know.

00:38.538 --> 00:39.835
Tell me what I can do.

00:40.006 --> 00:42.065
I drank vervain,
asked her to take it away.

00:42.242 --> 00:44.506
I want you to tell me everything
she said.

00:44.677 --> 00:47.578
I found my way to someone
in his trusted circle.

00:47.747 --> 00:49.214
One of Klaus' witches.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.509
He's all yours.

00:52.118 --> 00:56.316
I have Katherine and the moonstone.
Klaus has everything he needs for now.

00:58.358 --> 00:59.586
Alaric?

01:01.861 --> 01:04.193
Katerina, I have missed you.

01:04.864 --> 01:06.764
Klaus.

01:11.638 --> 01:14.971
Who is this guy, Safari Sam?

01:16.209 --> 01:19.406
Okay, bad or badder?

01:20.080 --> 01:22.742
- The dark colors suit you better.
- Oh, thank you, honey.

01:23.116 --> 01:24.811
Okay, pop quiz.

01:24.984 --> 01:27.976
The dagger and white ash
are in the Salvatore's possession?

01:28.154 --> 01:30.122
The dagger was used to kill Elijah.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.451
You'll find him in the basement
of the house.

01:32.759 --> 01:35.751
Okay, that dagger needs to stay
exactly where it is.

01:35.929 --> 01:39.057
The last thing I need to do
is resurrect Elijah.

01:39.232 --> 01:40.597
Oh, that guy is a buzz kill.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.428
You're on the outs with Jenna.

01:42.769 --> 01:46.466
Right, Elena's aunt.
For, uh, all the lies about Isobel.

01:46.639 --> 01:48.607
- What else?
- That's it.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.610
Oh, so jumpy.

01:54.781 --> 01:59.514
Please just kill me.
I've told you everything that I know.

02:01.654 --> 02:05.351
You see, I believe
that you believe that.

02:05.525 --> 02:07.254
But what would you not know?

02:08.961 --> 02:12.022
What could they be keeping from you?

02:12.198 --> 02:13.290
Hmm?

02:13.466 --> 02:15.434
Anything?

02:16.302 --> 02:17.826
Tell me.

02:18.505 --> 02:21.440
They were trying to see
if Bonnie could find a way...

02:21.608 --> 02:23.542
...to kill an Original without a dagger.

02:23.710 --> 02:25.803
Bonnie the best friend?

02:28.148 --> 02:30.207
You said she didn't have
her powers anymore.

02:30.416 --> 02:32.611
She doesn't or didn't. I don't know.

02:33.686 --> 02:35.984
You kidnapped me.
I'm kind of out of the loop.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.317
Well, we'll have to get
to the bottom of that.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.789
Just kill me, Klaus,
and be done with it.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.154
And show you kindness?

02:44.030 --> 02:48.490
I've searched for you
for over 500 years.

02:49.202 --> 02:53.332
Your death is going to last
at least half that long.

02:58.645 --> 03:02.137
Now, I want you to take this knife...

03:04.017 --> 03:06.349
...and stab yourself.

03:08.000 --> 03:14.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:16.396 --> 03:18.091
Now, take it out.

03:19.232 --> 03:25.102
Now, while I'm gone, I want you
to do that over and over and over again.

03:25.271 --> 03:28.763
And if you get bored, switch legs.

03:29.776 --> 03:30.868
Where are you going?

03:31.544 --> 03:35.241
I'm gonna go lay eyes
on my precious doppelganger.

03:42.021 --> 03:44.182
Oh, don't look so glum, Katerina.

03:46.392 --> 03:48.622
The fun is just beginning.

03:51.297 --> 03:53.094
Again.

04:01.007 --> 04:03.237
- Please sign here and here.
- Okay.

04:03.409 --> 04:06.105
So this place is all yours?
They just gave it to you?

04:06.279 --> 04:07.507
For now.

04:07.814 --> 04:12.581
As sole owner, I'm the only one who can
invite a certain type of person in here.

04:12.752 --> 04:15.812
- Your own personal safe house.
- That's the idea.

04:16.656 --> 04:17.884
Wouldn't wanna clean it.

04:22.795 --> 04:24.786
You really think Bonnie
can take on Klaus?

04:25.331 --> 04:28.061
She said she'd channel
enough witch's power to kill him.

04:28.234 --> 04:31.328
Elijah thought that would work
and he was an Original, so...

04:31.537 --> 04:33.903
- We just need to find him.
- Yeah.

04:34.073 --> 04:36.337
Could she do one
of those witch tracking spells?

04:36.542 --> 04:39.477
Nope. Not without something
that belongs to Klaus.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.910
Believe me, I already asked.

04:46.452 --> 04:47.783
Do you think he killed her?

04:50.623 --> 04:52.420
Katherine?

04:54.794 --> 04:55.988
Probably.

04:58.164 --> 05:00.428
It's not like she didn't have it coming.

05:03.269 --> 05:04.600
Yeah.

05:07.340 --> 05:08.637
Thank you, Mr. Henry.

05:14.647 --> 05:17.445
I'm sorry. I completely forgot.

05:17.617 --> 05:19.448
Stefan.

05:19.719 --> 05:21.619
Would you like to come
inside my house?

05:21.788 --> 05:23.653
I would love to.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.017
Thank you.

05:27.126 --> 05:30.118
- What are we, 12?
- One of us is.

05:31.698 --> 05:35.964
If I let you in, do you promise
to obey the owner of this house?

05:36.235 --> 05:37.998
- No.
- Seriously, Damon.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.368
My way. You promised.
I call the shots.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.873
No lies, no secret agendas.
Remember?

05:45.111 --> 05:47.409
Yes, Elena. Sure.

05:48.114 --> 05:49.411
Then please, come in.

05:52.185 --> 05:54.210
Shut up.

05:56.622 --> 05:58.385
- Thanks.
- Wait, where are you going?

05:58.891 --> 06:00.256
To school.

06:00.426 --> 06:03.361
No, no. We didn't create a safe house
for you to leave it.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.861
Yeah, guys, Klaus is out there.
We know that.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.260
Right. But where?

06:07.834 --> 06:09.062
No one knows.

06:09.235 --> 06:12.500
Look, I really appreciate
what you guys are doing.

06:12.672 --> 06:15.835
I'll be able to sleep at night
knowing that I'll be safe here...

06:16.008 --> 06:18.533
...but I'm not gonna be a prisoner.

06:22.582 --> 06:24.049
Your way, Elena.

06:24.217 --> 06:25.445
Don't worry, I'm ready.

06:25.651 --> 06:28.779
If he shows his face, I can take him.
Know how.

06:29.956 --> 06:33.517
The way I see it, next to Bonnie
is the safest place that I can be.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.354
Come on.

06:41.300 --> 06:43.894
Wait, I'm coming.

06:53.913 --> 06:57.041
- Caroline left early for school.
- I know. I came to see you.

06:57.216 --> 06:59.980
I don't know what to do.
What to say, how to act.

07:00.186 --> 07:01.710
You can't let on that you know.

07:01.888 --> 07:04.721
- She wants me to take her to the dance.
- Take her.

07:04.891 --> 07:07.291
I'll never get away with it.
She'll figure it out.

07:07.460 --> 07:09.223
Oh, damn it, Matt, just do it.

07:09.796 --> 07:11.661
She's my daughter. She's my baby.

07:11.831 --> 07:14.391
- I just... I need some time.
- I know, but...

07:14.567 --> 07:18.298
Look, if what Caroline told you is true,
she's not the only one.

07:18.471 --> 07:20.063
The Salvatores are vampires.

07:20.239 --> 07:21.934
The Gilbert family is in on it.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.906
- Tyler Lockwood is God knows what.
- A werewolf.

07:25.645 --> 07:28.671
There's no one in this town I can trust.

07:28.848 --> 07:32.579
I just need to take a beat
and figure out what to do.

07:33.319 --> 07:34.445
That'll never fool her.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.917
Yes, you will.

07:36.088 --> 07:39.080
As far as she knows,
you don't remember anything.

07:39.258 --> 07:42.921
Buy me some time. Please, Matt.

08:02.882 --> 08:04.372
Hello, class.

08:06.452 --> 08:11.617
What are we learning today?

08:11.791 --> 08:14.760
With the decade dance,
we've been covering the '60s all week.

08:15.027 --> 08:18.793
Right. The '60s.

08:28.374 --> 08:29.864
The, uh, ahem...

08:31.911 --> 08:33.378
The '60s...

08:34.514 --> 08:38.416
I wish there was something good
I could say about the '60s, but...

08:39.352 --> 08:42.549
They kind of sucked. Except for
the Beatles. They made it bearable.

08:42.722 --> 08:44.417
Uh, what else was there?

08:44.590 --> 08:48.048
The Cuban missile thing, the, uh...
We walked on the moon.

08:48.227 --> 08:50.695
- There was Watergate.
- Watergate was the '70s, Ric.

08:54.066 --> 08:56.057
I mean, Mr. Saltzman.

08:56.369 --> 09:01.773
Right. It kind of mushes together
up here, the '60s, '70s.

09:01.941 --> 09:04.705
Thank you, Elena.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.586
- Hey, Dana.
- Hey.

09:18.090 --> 09:19.853
- Can you take care of these?
- Sure.

09:20.026 --> 09:21.687
Thanks.

09:24.430 --> 09:26.330
Hi.

09:31.337 --> 09:32.804
What was that for?

09:32.972 --> 09:34.735
Just practicing for tonight.

09:37.443 --> 09:42.779
So I found a suit
if you still want me to be JFK tonight.

09:43.983 --> 09:45.712
Perfect.

09:48.854 --> 09:51.755
Did you tell Elena what it's gonna take
to do that Klaus spell?

09:51.924 --> 09:53.255
No, and you're not either.

09:53.426 --> 09:56.987
- She's gotta know you can't do it.
- We don't know I can't. Have faith.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.494
That's not fair.

09:58.664 --> 10:01.497
You can't harness the power
of a hundred dead witches. It'll kill you.

10:01.667 --> 10:04.158
Shh. We don't know that for certain.

10:04.370 --> 10:06.895
You promised to keep my secret,
I'm trusting you.

10:07.073 --> 10:09.564
I'm going through with this
and if you tell anyone...

10:09.742 --> 10:12.370
What? What are you gonna do?

10:14.780 --> 10:17.647
Hey, Jer. How you doing?

10:17.817 --> 10:20.479
Are you okay at the house alone
with John?

10:20.653 --> 10:22.518
It's not ideal.

10:22.888 --> 10:24.287
You haven't heard from Jenna?

10:24.457 --> 10:28.757
It looks like she's staying on campus.
Look, I'm, uh... I'm late for class.

10:33.833 --> 10:36.165
- What's going on?
- I told him he had to dress up...

10:36.335 --> 10:38.166
...and he got all uptight.
- Ha, ha.

10:39.505 --> 10:41.166
Hey, Elena, there you are.

10:41.340 --> 10:43.433
Okay. This is gonna sound freaky...

10:43.609 --> 10:46.601
...but this totally hot guy
just asked me to ask you...

10:46.779 --> 10:49.339
...if you're going to the dance tonight.

10:49.515 --> 10:51.176
Tell him she has a boyfriend.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.874
You could at least meet him.

10:53.052 --> 10:56.510
He'll be at the dance tonight.
Look for him. His name is Klaus.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.221
I'm sorry, what did you just say?

11:01.427 --> 11:03.361
His name's Klaus.

11:03.529 --> 11:06.157
I know the name's stupid,
but I swear he's hot.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.027
Where is he? Is he here?

11:10.036 --> 11:11.833
I don't know.

11:12.872 --> 11:14.396
She's been compelled.

11:14.573 --> 11:18.168
But he wants to know if you'll save him
the last dance. How cute is that?

11:21.247 --> 11:23.044
So we go to the dance and find him.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.682
How are we gonna do that?
We don't know what he looks like.

11:26.852 --> 11:29.082
He's not gonna be 16 and pimply.

11:29.255 --> 11:32.713
He could be anywhere at any time.
He compelled somebody at school.

11:33.059 --> 11:34.890
This is not as safe
as you guys thought, huh?

11:38.264 --> 11:39.959
There you are.

11:42.668 --> 11:43.999
Sorry I'm late.

11:44.170 --> 11:46.434
Put me down as a chaperone
at the dance tonight.

11:46.605 --> 11:48.505
Klaus made his first move.

11:48.674 --> 11:52.474
Okay, so we find him and then what? Hmm?
What's our plan of attack?

11:53.079 --> 11:54.671
Me.

11:55.347 --> 11:58.748
I'm the plan. He has no idea
how much power I can channel.

11:59.118 --> 12:01.609
If you can find him, I can kill him.

12:02.221 --> 12:03.745
That's not gonna be that easy.

12:03.923 --> 12:06.289
I mean, he is the biggest,
baddest vampire around.

12:06.692 --> 12:09.183
Alaric has a point.
I mean, what if he...?

12:16.302 --> 12:18.270
Well, I was impressed.

12:18.437 --> 12:20.928
It doesn't matter if he's an Original.

12:21.107 --> 12:23.268
I can take down anyone
who comes at me.

12:24.243 --> 12:25.608
I can kill him, Elena.

12:27.279 --> 12:28.712
I know I can.

12:39.024 --> 12:41.049
Ah, you're right.

12:41.227 --> 12:43.491
This witch is all juiced up
and aiming to kill.

12:44.563 --> 12:45.621
That's terrible.

12:46.031 --> 12:47.862
We're gonna have to kill her, Maddox.

12:48.634 --> 12:51.865
Now, do you think this Alaric guy
has anything vintage?

12:56.542 --> 12:59.511
Crossbows, wooden bullets
and automatics?

13:03.816 --> 13:06.580
- Who is this guy, again?
- He's the local vampire hunter.

13:07.419 --> 13:09.819
Ah. Well, that explains the clothing.

13:10.556 --> 13:11.818
All I could find.

13:12.024 --> 13:13.389
Guy likes his bourbon.

13:13.559 --> 13:16.153
I knew there was something about him
I liked.

13:19.131 --> 13:20.962
There's a high school dance...

13:21.133 --> 13:23.966
...and I'm gonna need you
to take out the witch bitch.

13:24.136 --> 13:26.627
If she has that much power,
she can sense me coming.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.900
I won't be able to get near her.
You have to do it.

13:30.075 --> 13:32.407
In this body?
I'm a haggard history teacher.

13:32.578 --> 13:33.909
She can easily hurt me.

13:34.079 --> 13:38.311
I mean, not me, Klaus me,
but you know what I mean.

13:39.451 --> 13:42.682
No witch could handle channeling
that much power.

13:42.855 --> 13:46.484
It'll kill her. It would kill me.

13:47.059 --> 13:48.526
You have to make her use it.

13:48.694 --> 13:52.027
You mean like provoking her to death?

13:52.198 --> 13:55.190
It won't take long.
Just keep attacking her until it kills her.

13:55.601 --> 13:58.502
His body, Alaric's,
will last longer than hers will.

13:58.671 --> 14:00.332
How? He's human.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.002
I can help in that department.

14:04.643 --> 14:07.373
I can do a spell to protect you.

14:16.222 --> 14:19.282
There you are. You almost missed me.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.289
How do I look?

14:22.127 --> 14:24.288
- Jackie O?
- Ha, ha. Duh.

14:24.630 --> 14:27.895
- You look good.
- Thanks.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.031
Is everything okay?

14:32.705 --> 14:34.696
Uh, just some work stress.

14:36.475 --> 14:37.737
Well, you work too much.

14:49.488 --> 14:50.546
- Mr. President.
- Hey.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.486
Hi.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.054
- Sheriff.
- Sorry.

14:56.228 --> 14:58.890
- Have fun.
- We will.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.932
- Bye.
- Bye.

15:05.905 --> 15:09.397
Your relatives were such pack rats.

15:09.575 --> 15:11.566
Okay, so, what do you think?

15:11.744 --> 15:14.645
Twiggy or sexy hippy?

15:14.813 --> 15:16.007
Ooh.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.217
You know it's not too late
to back out, right?

15:22.388 --> 15:25.516
And what, miss out on all the fun?

15:32.665 --> 15:34.223
Hey.

15:37.202 --> 15:40.797
All this time
I spent worrying about Klaus...

15:40.973 --> 15:44.568
...and I think I convinced myself
that he's not real.

15:46.779 --> 15:47.871
But he is.

15:49.381 --> 15:51.246
And tonight...

15:51.450 --> 15:53.748
...we will put an end to him.

16:04.096 --> 16:05.324
I love you.

16:07.900 --> 16:10.232
I want you to tell me that
when the night's over.

16:16.742 --> 16:18.972
Any time tonight.

16:34.126 --> 16:36.720
<i>Well, I got a silly little girl</i>
<i>She's on my mind</i>

16:36.895 --> 16:38.624
<i>Look at her</i>
<i>She looks so fine</i>

16:38.797 --> 16:40.731
<i>She's the best girl I've ever had</i>

16:40.899 --> 16:43.060
<i>Except that she's gonna make me</i>
<i>Feel so sad</i>

16:59.485 --> 17:00.884
<i>Hush, hush</i>

17:01.053 --> 17:03.817
Nice outfit, Mr. Saltzman.
Totally far out.

17:03.989 --> 17:07.390
Thank you, Dana. Thank you.
Now, who is your date?

17:07.559 --> 17:09.550
Chad, Mr. Saltzman, from third period.

17:10.061 --> 17:11.551
Chad, of course.

17:11.763 --> 17:14.892
How would you and your friends
like, uh, to earn a little extra credit?

17:20.672 --> 17:22.263
Wait.

17:25.144 --> 17:27.578
Look, I, um, want you to have this.

17:28.847 --> 17:31.509
If you're asking me to go steady,
that was the '50s.

17:31.683 --> 17:33.878
No, I'm serious, Bonnie.

17:34.920 --> 17:37.684
- The ring won't work on me.
- But it was made by a witch.

17:37.856 --> 17:41.485
To protect from the supernatural,
not for someone who is.

17:42.528 --> 17:47.192
Well, I have to do something.
I can't just let you get yourself killed.

17:47.366 --> 17:51.302
Just because dead witches gave me
a warning doesn't mean I'm gonna die.

17:51.470 --> 17:54.337
So you're saying there's a fifty-fifty shot
you won't?

17:55.574 --> 17:57.701
Look, I'm sorry...

17:58.043 --> 18:01.740
...but you know I don't have the
best luck in the girlfriend department.

18:03.048 --> 18:04.345
Hey.

18:04.516 --> 18:09.647
Listen, l... I can't explain it,
but I can feel them.

18:09.822 --> 18:12.086
I'm empowered, Jeremy. I can do this.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.316
I know I can.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.187
I'm strong enough.

18:24.636 --> 18:26.365
Damon.

18:26.738 --> 18:27.966
Evening.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.939
Hey, you two. Oh, you look nice.

18:37.116 --> 18:38.913
You too.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.609
You guys ready to do this?

18:50.195 --> 18:54.757
<i>Because it's hard for me</i>
<i>My baby</i>

18:54.933 --> 18:56.560
Thanks for being here, everybody.

19:09.114 --> 19:12.242
We have a special shout-out tonight.

19:12.684 --> 19:14.413
This is for Elena.

19:16.989 --> 19:18.183
From Klaus.

19:24.129 --> 19:27.360
<i>This is dedicated to the one I love</i>

19:27.533 --> 19:31.264
<i>- This is dedicated</i>
<i>- To the one I love</i>

19:31.436 --> 19:34.599
<i>This is dedicated</i>

19:37.776 --> 19:40.973
That was a lame, cheap shot.
He's just trying to bait us.

19:41.146 --> 19:42.238
I know everyone here.

19:42.414 --> 19:45.281
Maybe he's not here.
He just wants us to believe that he is.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.111
It's a party, people. Blend.

19:47.286 --> 19:49.277
- Let him come to us.
- Good idea.

19:49.454 --> 19:52.981
- No, no, I really don't feel like dancing.
- Too bad.

19:54.059 --> 19:56.050
There's Ric.

19:56.228 --> 19:57.855
I'll be back.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.589
Well?

20:00.766 --> 20:03.132
<i>We were out on a date</i>
<i>In my daddy's car</i>

20:03.869 --> 20:07.566
Special dedication, huh?
This guy's a little twisted.

20:07.739 --> 20:10.503
- I'm not impressed.
- No?

20:10.676 --> 20:12.769
Let me know if you see anything
out of whack.

20:12.945 --> 20:17.348
<i>A car was stalled</i>
<i>The engine was dead</i>

20:17.516 --> 20:21.145
<i>I couldn't stop</i>
<i>So I swerved to the right</i>

20:21.320 --> 20:25.347
<i>I'll never forget the sound that night</i>

20:25.524 --> 20:29.790
<i>The screaming tires</i>
<i>And the busted glass</i>

20:29.962 --> 20:35.923
<i>The painful scream that I heard last</i>

20:36.101 --> 20:39.093
Caroline's here. They don't know.
We have to tell her.

20:39.271 --> 20:43.139
- I'm on it.
<i>- Oh, where, oh, where could my baby be?</i>

20:43.308 --> 20:45.833
<i>The Lord took her away from me</i>

20:46.011 --> 20:47.808
- How you doing?
- Um...

20:48.347 --> 20:50.815
Freaking out a bit. You?

20:51.149 --> 20:52.207
Cool as a cucumber.

20:52.551 --> 20:55.349
Come on,
remember the last decade dance?

20:55.520 --> 20:59.513
The vampires were all, "aah!"
And you were all, "aah!"

20:59.691 --> 21:01.682
Right, and we won.

21:01.860 --> 21:04.226
Yes, we did.

21:04.630 --> 21:08.623
<i>There were people standing all around</i>

21:08.834 --> 21:11.997
- You're good at this.
- I've got moves you've never seen.

21:14.139 --> 21:16.835
- Dance with me.
- I'm a really bad dancer.

21:17.309 --> 21:18.469
I know better than that.

21:18.644 --> 21:21.807
<i>She looked at me and said:</i>

21:21.980 --> 21:25.313
<i>"Hold me, darlin'</i>
<i>Just a little while"</i>

21:25.751 --> 21:27.116
<i>I held her close</i>

21:27.452 --> 21:28.942
What?

21:30.155 --> 21:31.713
You look really pretty tonight.

21:33.058 --> 21:34.423
Hey, guys.

21:34.593 --> 21:35.685
- Hey.
- Hey, what's up?

21:35.861 --> 21:38.853
Hey. Do you mind if I steal your date
for a moment?

21:39.264 --> 21:41.960
No, not all.
I'II, uh, get us something to drink.

21:42.901 --> 21:44.698
Thanks. Hey.

21:45.070 --> 21:46.162
What's wrong?

21:46.738 --> 21:48.035
Klaus is here.

21:48.707 --> 21:50.072
- What?
- Yeah.

21:50.242 --> 21:52.107
- Where?
- We have no idea.

21:52.277 --> 21:55.872
But keep your eye out for anything
that might look weird, okay?

21:56.481 --> 21:59.939
<i>She's gone to heaven</i>
<i>So I gotta be good</i>

22:00.118 --> 22:01.608
- May I?
<i>- So I can see my baby</i>

22:01.920 --> 22:05.879
<i>When I leave this world</i>

22:07.259 --> 22:09.784
You heard Jeremy and me talking,
didn't you?

22:09.995 --> 22:12.395
- Is it true?
- Yes.

22:13.932 --> 22:18.528
The part about you having a fifty-fifty
shot of surviving? Is that true?

22:18.737 --> 22:20.705
He was upset.
I didn't want him to worry.

22:20.872 --> 22:24.239
So you lay it all out on the line for Elena,
no matter what.

22:24.409 --> 22:27.401
- No matter what.
- Good.

22:27.579 --> 22:29.911
- You can't tell her.
- Your secret's safe with me.

22:30.082 --> 22:34.576
But, I mean, with all that power,
is there no way to increase your odds?

22:34.920 --> 22:37.650
<i>Oh, where, oh, where could my baby be?</i>

22:37.823 --> 22:40.951
Careful, Damon.
I might start to think you actually care.

22:41.259 --> 22:42.590
We wouldn't want that.

22:43.895 --> 22:47.422
<i>She's gone to heaven</i>
<i>So I gotta be good</i>

22:47.599 --> 22:49.726
<i>So I can see my baby...</i>

22:49.901 --> 22:51.129
What are they up to?

22:52.037 --> 22:53.095
Who knows?

22:55.474 --> 22:58.238
Is there something going on, Jer?
Are you okay?

22:58.410 --> 22:59.968
Fine.

23:01.179 --> 23:02.908
I'm fine.

23:06.251 --> 23:08.776
Hey, everything all right?

23:10.288 --> 23:12.313
I'm not sure.

23:16.762 --> 23:18.491
Jeremy.

23:20.799 --> 23:23.495
What are you doing?
Elena thinks we should stick together.

23:23.668 --> 23:26.933
Yeah, I'm fine. I've got my ring.

23:33.211 --> 23:36.078
It's... It's Bonnie.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.811
What is it?

23:40.786 --> 23:43.846
Hey, you got something
on your mind, spit it out.

23:46.591 --> 23:49.219
If Bonnie takes on Klaus...

23:50.495 --> 23:53.589
...channeling all that energy's
gonna kill her.

23:55.133 --> 23:56.691
What?

23:57.502 --> 24:02.132
But she doesn't want Elena to know
because she's gonna try to stop her.

24:03.542 --> 24:06.636
And it's Elena
that could turn up dead, so...

24:09.047 --> 24:11.413
What am I supposed to do?

24:15.220 --> 24:17.950
<i>Look at the way</i>

24:18.123 --> 24:21.524
<i>I gotta hide what I'm doin'</i>

24:22.227 --> 24:25.219
<i>'Cause what would they say</i>

24:26.097 --> 24:28.691
<i>If they ever knew and so we're</i>

24:28.867 --> 24:30.767
<i>Runnin'just as fast as we can</i>

24:30.936 --> 24:32.164
Oh, yeah.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.868
<i>Holdin' onto one another's hand</i>

24:36.041 --> 24:37.167
I need to talk to you.

24:37.342 --> 24:39.401
<i>Trying to get away into the night</i>

24:39.578 --> 24:42.240
<i>And then I put my arms around you</i>
<i>And you tumble...</i>

24:42.414 --> 24:46.783
Come here. Tell me you didn't know
that Bonnie was on a suicide mission.

24:46.952 --> 24:49.716
Great. Jeremy told you
and, of course, you told Elena.

24:49.888 --> 24:52.049
I told her.
You promised her no more secrets.

24:52.357 --> 24:53.915
I changed my mind.

24:54.092 --> 24:57.027
- How could you not tell me?
- Because I knew how'd you react.

24:57.195 --> 25:00.892
- No. No way, it's not an option.
- It's our only option.

25:01.066 --> 25:03.091
Then we'll find another way, okay?

25:04.169 --> 25:06.103
Bonnie, you're not dying
to save my life.

25:06.271 --> 25:08.364
I have the power to save you.

25:08.540 --> 25:11.407
If I don't use it and something happens,
that would kill me.

25:11.576 --> 25:12.804
I can't let you.

25:13.378 --> 25:14.936
Just answer one question.

25:16.281 --> 25:18.875
If the situation was reversed...

25:19.117 --> 25:20.379
...would you do it for me?

25:27.492 --> 25:29.619
So you know why I have to.

25:33.965 --> 25:36.433
No. No.

25:50.949 --> 25:52.780
What's going on, guys?

25:52.951 --> 25:54.942
You okay, Gilbert?
You don't look so good.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.645
Dude, seriously?
Wrong day, wrong guy.

26:07.299 --> 26:08.857
Hey, idiots.

26:14.773 --> 26:17.139
Let me guess. Klaus says hi.

26:20.011 --> 26:21.603
Don't kill him. He's compelled.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.714
- So?
- So the whole thing's a distraction.

26:23.882 --> 26:26.612
Go find Bonnie and Elena.
I got this. Go.

26:31.556 --> 26:33.285
Elena.

26:33.458 --> 26:34.891
- What is it?
- He has Jeremy.

26:35.060 --> 26:37.187
- What?
- Yeah, Klaus has Jeremy. Come on.

26:50.941 --> 26:54.433
- Okay, so where are you taking us?
- Just a little further.

26:56.513 --> 26:58.140
Wait.

26:58.615 --> 27:01.448
- Something's not right.
- Where's Jeremy?

27:03.220 --> 27:05.313
I just had to get away from that dance.

27:07.090 --> 27:08.819
The '60s. Ugh.

27:09.159 --> 27:11.127
Not my decade. Ha, ha.

27:11.561 --> 27:14.553
I mean, whose call was that, anyway?
I much prefer the '20s.

27:14.931 --> 27:18.389
You know, the style, the parties, the jazz.

27:19.669 --> 27:21.534
Alaric.

27:22.973 --> 27:24.099
Are you on vervain?

27:26.076 --> 27:28.909
Now, why would you ask me
that question, Elena?

27:33.083 --> 27:35.745
- He's being compelled.
- Nope. Try again.

27:35.919 --> 27:37.079
What's going on?

27:38.655 --> 27:40.748
Okay, I'll give you a hint.

27:40.924 --> 27:44.451
I am not Alaric.

27:51.068 --> 27:54.595
- Klaus.
- Surprise.

27:54.871 --> 27:56.668
Oh, no.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.308
No, it's not possible.

27:59.476 --> 28:01.842
Just relax, Elena.
I'm not here to hurt you.

28:03.580 --> 28:06.515
You're not on my hit list tonight.

28:06.683 --> 28:07.809
But you are.

28:16.359 --> 28:19.886
Now, did I mention
that I know a witch?

28:21.131 --> 28:23.827
You're gonna have to hit me
a lot harder than that.

28:33.143 --> 28:36.806
By all means, fire away.

28:36.980 --> 28:39.744
If you kill this body,
I'll just get a new one.

28:41.518 --> 28:46.478
- Maybe Jeremy.
- Go. Run. Run.

28:52.062 --> 28:54.929
- What happened?
- Klaus is in Alaric's body.

28:55.132 --> 28:57.032
- What?
- He's possessing it or something.

28:57.200 --> 29:00.192
- Go find Stefan. Now.
- Okay.

29:00.370 --> 29:01.928
Now.

29:02.772 --> 29:05.104
- Can you kill him?
- He's got some protection spell.

29:05.275 --> 29:07.743
You have the power
of a hundred witches. Break it.

29:07.911 --> 29:11.005
I'm trying. If I kill Alaric,
he'll just possess someone else.

29:12.149 --> 29:15.710
He knows I have my power, Damon.
He's trying to kill me.

29:17.454 --> 29:21.413
No. Klaus does not get to win tonight,
no way.

29:21.858 --> 29:24.418
You still willing to do
whatever it takes to kill him?

29:31.868 --> 29:34.530
<i>With a love, oh, so true</i>

29:34.704 --> 29:38.003
<i>And a hand that I can hold</i>

29:38.175 --> 29:39.403
Hey, are you okay?

29:40.076 --> 29:42.738
Um, yeah. I'm just...

29:43.113 --> 29:44.273
I'm looking for Stefan.

29:44.447 --> 29:45.675
Seriously, what's wrong?

29:46.249 --> 29:50.379
Uh, just... Just, um, stay with Matt, okay?

29:52.889 --> 29:58.225
- What was that about?
- Oh, uh, you know, just same old drama.

30:20.584 --> 30:22.017
What took you so long?

30:23.220 --> 30:28.283
Now, do you wanna do this
the, uh, easy way or the hard way?

30:37.968 --> 30:39.162
The hard way.

30:39.469 --> 30:40.959
Got it.

30:45.442 --> 30:47.808
What? Would you kill
your favorite history teacher?

30:48.945 --> 30:50.310
It's what Alaric would want.

30:51.781 --> 30:53.806
And he'd want you to suffer first.

30:54.684 --> 30:55.981
Look at you. Ha, ha.

30:57.554 --> 30:59.385
Is that all you got?

31:01.558 --> 31:03.116
Let's find out.

31:05.462 --> 31:07.123
- There you are.
- What are you doing?

31:07.297 --> 31:09.959
- Where's Bonnie?
- She's doing what she has to do.

31:10.133 --> 31:11.566
- What?
- Where is she?

31:11.768 --> 31:14.066
- Stefan, let her do this.
- Damn it, where is she?

31:39.562 --> 31:41.427
Bonnie, no!

31:57.947 --> 31:59.710
Die!

31:59.883 --> 32:01.145
Aah!

32:03.520 --> 32:04.714
Bonnie?

32:26.409 --> 32:28.400
No!

32:34.718 --> 32:37.846
Bonnie, Bonnie.
Bonnie, Bonnie, hey, hey.

32:38.221 --> 32:39.552
Stefan, she's not breathing.

32:41.658 --> 32:45.287
Stefan. Stefan, I can't find her pulse,
Stefan.

32:45.729 --> 32:47.458
Do something, please.

32:47.630 --> 32:51.464
Stefan, please. Just give her blood,
do something, please.

32:53.236 --> 32:56.569
It's too late. I'm sorry.

32:57.907 --> 33:00.569
No. No.

33:00.744 --> 33:03.372
No, no, no.

33:03.546 --> 33:05.741
Bonnie. Bonnie, please, no.

33:05.915 --> 33:09.112
No, no, no.

33:09.285 --> 33:12.015
Stefan, get Elena out of here.
I'll deal with the body.

33:13.156 --> 33:15.989
- Deal with it?
- The sheriff can't know about this.

33:16.159 --> 33:18.093
Last thing we need
is a mysterious death.

33:18.261 --> 33:19.819
This is Bonnie.

33:21.998 --> 33:24.125
Get her home. Now.

33:24.300 --> 33:25.961
So I can clean this up.

33:26.136 --> 33:28.798
Hey, hey, hey.

33:28.972 --> 33:30.963
No. Jeremy.

33:31.141 --> 33:33.473
Oh, my God, Jeremy.
What about Jeremy?

33:33.643 --> 33:36.043
- I'll find him.
- No.

34:11.681 --> 34:15.208
Damon. Hey, I got your message.
I can't find anyone.

34:15.385 --> 34:17.751
Where's Elena, where's Bonnie?

34:20.924 --> 34:22.858
We need to have a little talk.

34:45.648 --> 34:47.513
Hey.

34:51.788 --> 34:53.119
Here, drink this.

34:55.757 --> 34:58.124
- I can't.
- Yeah.

34:58.294 --> 35:01.559
Yeah, you can. Please drink this.

35:11.241 --> 35:14.267
- This is my fault.
- No, no, no.

35:14.444 --> 35:15.934
No. Hey.

35:16.112 --> 35:18.637
This was Klaus. Listen to me.

35:18.815 --> 35:20.077
Klaus did this.

35:24.854 --> 35:27.652
- What did you do with her?
- Will you please calm her down?

35:27.824 --> 35:30.520
Don't talk like I'm not standing
right in front of you.

35:30.693 --> 35:33.025
Please calm down.

35:33.196 --> 35:34.686
You knew. Didn't you?

35:34.864 --> 35:38.425
You knew that if she harnessed all that
power, she would die, didn't you?

35:38.601 --> 35:39.932
Yes.

35:40.103 --> 35:41.695
Yes, I knew.

35:45.008 --> 35:49.308
You need to listen to me and prepare
for what I'm about to say.

36:02.292 --> 36:04.658
<i>Bonnie had to die.</i>

36:05.828 --> 36:08.991
<i>Klaus using Alaric's body</i>
<i>was a total surprise.</i>

36:09.165 --> 36:11.463
<i>She wasn't prepared for that.</i>

36:13.002 --> 36:14.799
And he wasn't going to stop.

36:14.971 --> 36:18.202
And we weren't gonna be able
to stop him until he knew she was dead.

36:21.144 --> 36:22.372
He had to believe it.

36:37.226 --> 36:40.127
Hey. Hey. Hey.

36:45.068 --> 36:47.901
<i>She cast a spell.</i>

36:50.840 --> 36:52.330
Bonnie's okay.

37:07.690 --> 37:09.521
You know, you could have told me.

37:09.692 --> 37:12.923
How do I know when you're gonna go
blabbing things to your girlfriend?

37:13.096 --> 37:14.927
You understand
what you put her through?

37:15.098 --> 37:17.931
See? That's why I didn't tell you.

37:18.134 --> 37:20.398
Because you would have never been able
to do it.

37:20.570 --> 37:24.028
Don't get me wrong, Stefan.
I don't mind being the bad guy.

37:24.207 --> 37:26.437
I'll make all
the life-and-death decisions...

37:26.643 --> 37:29.874
...while you're busy worrying
about collateral damage.

37:30.413 --> 37:32.745
I'll even let her hate me for it.

37:34.751 --> 37:38.687
But at the end of the day,
I'll be the one to keep her alive.

37:50.933 --> 37:54.425
- You sure it's safe here?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

37:58.274 --> 38:01.437
- What is that?
- It is MiFi.

38:01.878 --> 38:04.779
If we're gonna be stuck here,
we might as well have Internet.

38:04.947 --> 38:07.609
You don't have to stay down here
with me.

38:07.784 --> 38:10.309
Hey, look, I'm not letting you
out of my sight.

38:14.290 --> 38:16.986
I need you to talk to Elena for me.

38:17.427 --> 38:20.692
Tell her how sorry I am
for what Damon and I had to do.

38:21.698 --> 38:23.461
Well, uh...

38:24.333 --> 38:27.564
...why don't you tell her yourself?

38:27.737 --> 38:30.763
<i>- Bonnie.</i>
- Elena.

38:32.475 --> 38:35.740
<i>Elena. Elena, I'm so sorry.</i>

38:36.713 --> 38:38.146
It's okay, it's okay.

38:38.314 --> 38:39.975
<i>I just needed to see you myself.</i>

38:40.349 --> 38:42.943
There wasn't enough time
for me to tell you.

38:43.119 --> 38:44.950
<i>It's okay, seriously.</i>

38:45.121 --> 38:47.214
<i>Damon explained it all.</i>

38:54.897 --> 38:57.331
Ugh. Look...

38:57.533 --> 39:01.299
...Klaus had to think she was dead.
Your reaction had to be real.

39:03.439 --> 39:05.236
I understand why you did
what you did.

39:08.177 --> 39:11.738
Klaus was fooled and Bonnie's alive.

39:13.783 --> 39:15.842
Here's to duplicity.

39:17.754 --> 39:19.619
But let's get one thing straight,
Damon.

39:20.189 --> 39:23.488
Bonnie will not die for me,
I will not let that happen.

39:23.659 --> 39:25.217
We need to kill Klaus, Elena.

39:25.394 --> 39:29.125
Real Klaus. Who will probably be coming
to pay you a visit soon...

39:29.298 --> 39:31.823
...now that he knows
that Bonnie's dead.

39:33.169 --> 39:35.137
She's the only one who can do it.

39:36.305 --> 39:37.897
We'll find another way.

39:39.308 --> 39:40.798
I hope so.

39:45.181 --> 39:47.649
Look, I shouldn't have hit you.

39:48.651 --> 39:50.346
Apology accepted.

39:52.989 --> 39:55.549
Let me be clear about something.

39:57.059 --> 40:01.291
If it comes down to you and the witch
again, I will gladly let Bonnie die.

40:02.532 --> 40:06.161
I will always choose you.

40:17.613 --> 40:18.910
Good night, Damon.

40:19.615 --> 40:20.877
Good night.
