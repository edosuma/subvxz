WEBVTT

00:03.203 --> 00:05.467
One thing to pay a visit
after ten years, but,

00:05.538 --> 00:08.803
considering the number you did
on Knights Ridge in your book,

00:08.875 --> 00:10.536
you might meet some resistance.

00:10.610 --> 00:12.544
You're a mom, huh? I didn't know that.

00:12.612 --> 00:15.172
A lot you missed
when you vanished into the ether.

00:15.248 --> 00:17.148
- Surprised, Garrett?
- Shocked.

00:17.217 --> 00:19.378
- Meet Alison yet?
- What, Owen Rowan's wife?

00:19.486 --> 00:21.454
- I had sex with her.
- What?

00:21.554 --> 00:24.489
- What you been up to?
- Haven't left this house in five years.

00:24.557 --> 00:26.525
- Five years?
- Nick's stayin', Eddie.

00:26.593 --> 00:27.958
Isn't that great?

00:29.729 --> 00:30.991
Some time you wanna come out?

00:31.064 --> 00:34.158
- Are you asking me out, Eddie?
- I guess.

00:34.234 --> 00:35.292
[Nick] How old is Sam?

00:35.368 --> 00:38.929
He turns ten in two months.
Don't worry, he's not yours.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.008
The boy, he has your mother's eyes.

00:42.108 --> 00:43.405
College offered me a job.

00:43.476 --> 00:46.639
You can't just wander into our lives.
Not now.

00:46.746 --> 00:50.182
- You really think the kid is yours?
- Peanut allergy, he's got one.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.184
The men in my family
have peanut allergies.

00:52.252 --> 00:53.685
- Not that rare.
- Yeah, it is.

00:53.787 --> 00:54.754
No, it's not.

00:54.854 --> 00:58.221
Can I see a show of hands for
everyone here with a nut allergy?

01:03.029 --> 01:05.862
[Nick]... Foulke underhanded
the ball to Mientkiewicz.

01:05.932 --> 01:09.299
That's how the Red Sox
won the World Series.

01:09.369 --> 01:13.135
You probably know this, I'm pretty sure
The Big Guy up there had a hand in it.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.230
What else, what else, um...

01:15.308 --> 01:16.832
<i>[# Bryan Greenberg: Someday]</i>

01:16.910 --> 01:18.172
This thing with Sam...

01:19.546 --> 01:22.845
Hannah said the real father
is some guy named Gavin Goddard,

01:22.916 --> 01:26.249
but let's be serious, is anybody
really named Gavin Goddard?

01:26.319 --> 01:30.085
That's like a name that you make up
when you can't think of another name.

01:30.190 --> 01:32.522
But on the other hand,

01:32.592 --> 01:36.892
evidently everyone in the free world has
a peanut allergy, but I don't know...

01:38.631 --> 01:41.600
But here's what I keep
coming back to, Ma.

01:41.701 --> 01:44.397
I've already missed out on ten years.

01:44.471 --> 01:48.202
I can't really chance
missing any more, can I?

01:52.078 --> 01:53.375
Thanks, Ma.

01:53.446 --> 01:56.210
Glad we had this talk.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.045
I gotta go to class.

01:59.219 --> 02:03.588
Oh, yeah, Hannah's boy Sam.

02:03.656 --> 02:06.523
He's amazing. You would love him.

02:10.763 --> 02:13.095
And he would love you, too.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.168
I'll see you next week.

02:18.738 --> 02:21.036
Miss you a lot.

02:23.910 --> 02:25.673
Give my best to Steve McQueen.

02:28.815 --> 02:30.146
[Whistle blows]

02:32.585 --> 02:35.554
How much longer do
we have to hang out here?

02:35.622 --> 02:37.180
Just a little while longer.

02:39.000 --> 02:45.074

02:51.704 --> 02:53.535
[Whistle blows]

02:57.844 --> 02:59.209
I was coming over for that.

02:59.646 --> 03:02.877
Oh, um, I thought...

03:04.784 --> 03:07.548
I don't know what I thought.
You want me to go get it?

03:07.620 --> 03:09.554
It's already back in play.

03:09.622 --> 03:14.116
Right. So probably not.
That would be dumb.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.856
- You're silly, Seth.
- [Whistle blows]

03:16.930 --> 03:20.093
But my name's Sam.

03:20.166 --> 03:24.535
Let's get meatball subs... Seth.

03:25.271 --> 03:29.640
[Woman] "There was an age difference,
but Katherine didn't mind.

03:29.709 --> 03:35.204
Yes, he was older,
but there was a certainty about him,

03:35.281 --> 03:37.647
a youthful certainty...

03:37.717 --> 03:40.811
She couldn't help herself.

03:40.887 --> 03:45.051
She leaned down and she kissed him

03:45.158 --> 03:48.491
and it was everything she'd hoped for.

03:48.561 --> 03:54.397
At once, she understood
the true meaning of the word "shiver."

03:54.901 --> 03:57.597
It wasn't something you did when cold.

03:57.670 --> 04:00.833
It was something you did...

04:00.940 --> 04:02.100
...when hot."

04:10.350 --> 04:11.442
That's it.

04:14.254 --> 04:17.382
Comments? Ross.

04:17.457 --> 04:19.322
I think it was awesome.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.850
The way you realize
what lovemaking is.

04:22.929 --> 04:27.195
Uh, it's simple, but powerful.
Mad right-on.

04:27.267 --> 04:28.598
Thanks, Ross.

04:28.668 --> 04:33.765
[Nick] Yes, and there was honesty there,
but what I think Ross meant to say

04:33.840 --> 04:36.968
was that Aubrey's character
came to this realization.

04:37.043 --> 04:41.503
- Remember, guys, it's... it's fiction.
- [Bell rings]

04:41.581 --> 04:45.711
So, that's it. But, um, next week
we're reading Denny,

04:45.785 --> 04:48.083
Julia and, uh, Tim?

04:48.154 --> 04:51.988
All right... OK.

04:52.458 --> 04:57.327
Well? Derivative, brilliant, lame?

04:57.397 --> 05:00.366
Wow, self-hating and grandiose
all in one breath.

05:00.433 --> 05:01.764
You really are a writer.

05:01.834 --> 05:04.268
No, I thought...
I thought it was very strong.

05:04.337 --> 05:05.429
"Mad right-on"?

05:05.505 --> 05:07.996
Yeah, a little bit.
A little bit "mad right-on."

05:08.074 --> 05:10.941
- See ya next week.
- Mm-hmm.

05:11.010 --> 05:14.377
Oh, um, so I heard that you and
Eddie Latekka were hanging out.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.608
Are you guys becoming friends?

05:16.716 --> 05:20.277
Why do you ask? Are you jealous?

05:20.386 --> 05:21.410
Excuse me?

05:21.487 --> 05:23.853
Do you wanna be hanging out
with Eddie Latekka?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.985
Actually, yeah, I do.

05:28.361 --> 05:29.487
Give him time.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.827
[Nick] I'm tellin' ya, man,
this girl is very cool.

05:34.934 --> 05:36.492
[Lkey] And very hot!

05:36.569 --> 05:38.400
- She's my student, lkey.
- Who cares?

05:38.471 --> 05:41.497
Take that down like
Christmas decorations on January 10th.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.474
- Know what I can't understand?
- What?

05:43.543 --> 05:46.307
Alison Rowan. She seems sophisticated,

05:46.412 --> 05:48.437
- pretty, smart.
- Yeah.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.641
Why did she cheat on
her husband with you?

05:50.717 --> 05:52.981
- Tommy Tortorelli.
- Who?

05:53.052 --> 05:54.519
Her high school sweetheart.

05:54.587 --> 05:57.522
Went out for seven years.
He was a creep and broke her heart.

05:57.590 --> 06:00.218
Doesn't explain why she had
a one night stand with you.

06:00.293 --> 06:02.853
I remind her of Tommy Tortorelli.

06:02.962 --> 06:04.896
That's the only reason?

06:04.964 --> 06:06.625
- Yup.
- And that's OK by you?

06:06.699 --> 06:08.462
Oh, yeah. I'm good with it.

06:10.370 --> 06:11.337
[Nick] Hey.

06:11.437 --> 06:14.201
What does "rock the stadium
of her heart" mean?

06:15.241 --> 06:16.208
Excuse me?

06:16.309 --> 06:17.867
"Rock the stadium of her heart."

06:17.977 --> 06:20.343
You did it in your book
and got the girl to like you.

06:20.413 --> 06:24.179
OK, Sam, I didn't do anything in
my book. This is a work of fiction, OK?

06:25.952 --> 06:28.978
What do you want to know for?
There a girl you're interested in?

06:29.055 --> 06:32.081
- Huh?
- Amanda.

06:32.158 --> 06:36.527
Amanda, huh? Well,
does Amanda know that you exist?

06:38.731 --> 06:42.690
Ah! If you gotta think that long, kid,
it's what's known as a mute point.

06:42.802 --> 06:45.168
It's "moot", not "mute."

06:45.271 --> 06:48.399
OK, Vinnie Vocabulary.
The chick doesn't know you exist. Heh!

06:48.474 --> 06:50.032
[Nick] Here's the thing.

06:50.143 --> 06:53.704
"Rock the Stadium of Her Heart,"
that's... That's the third part

06:53.780 --> 06:55.714
in a three-phase wooing process.

06:55.782 --> 06:58.216
Maybe I should ask her to Pumpkin Fest.

06:58.284 --> 07:00.252
Unless things have changed around here,

07:00.353 --> 07:04.289
nobody asks anybody to go
to Pumpkin Fest. Everybody just goes.

07:04.357 --> 07:07.588
I got an idea.
You get through the first two phases,

07:07.660 --> 07:12.188
then you can "rock the stadium
of her heart" at Pumpkin Fest!

07:12.265 --> 07:14.631
- Ikey.
- Wouldn't be the first time. Heh!

07:14.700 --> 07:17.931
Can you? Come on.

07:21.307 --> 07:23.935
[Hannah] I mean,
I get that he's confused,

07:24.010 --> 07:27.377
but to challenge me
about being Sam's father?

07:27.447 --> 07:32.009
It's ridiculous, and the most ridiculous
part of it... is that we were fighting.

07:32.118 --> 07:35.281
I know. I saw the Pub Peanut Poll.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.447
- The what?
- You polled the pub,

07:37.523 --> 07:40.492
about the peanut thing.
Everyone is talking about it.

07:40.593 --> 07:43.289
- Everyone is talking about it?
- It was advanced.

07:43.362 --> 07:45.421
And it's not that surprising you fought.

07:45.498 --> 07:47.989
It's pretty much been coming for...
ten years.

07:48.067 --> 07:51.434
I don't think so. I made my peace
with Nick a long time ago.

07:51.537 --> 07:55.439
- I don't need to fight with him.
- Oh, OK.

07:55.508 --> 07:57.669
I'm sorry. Why am I still
talking about this?

07:57.743 --> 08:00.610
- I don't know why I'm still talking...
- No, you're fine.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.114
It's not that. Just...

08:05.117 --> 08:08.245
...I maybe have a maybe-date.
- What's a "maybe-date"?

08:08.321 --> 08:12.280
As in, maybe he won't call.
Uh, maybe if he does, I won't go.

08:12.391 --> 08:17.158
Maybe it's not even a date.
Maybe I wish I hadn't said anything.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.788
Who's the "maybe-date" with?

08:18.898 --> 08:21.526
Maybe not ready
to talk about that yet.

08:21.601 --> 08:25.332
Well, I think it's great that
maybe you have a "maybe-date."

08:25.404 --> 08:29.932
Back to Nick. I think that ten years
of silence has to come out somehow,

08:30.009 --> 08:33.842
- that it might be odd if it didn't.
- You know, the thing is,

08:33.913 --> 08:36.211
the whole time I was yelling at him,

08:36.315 --> 08:38.613
all I wanted to do was just...

08:39.619 --> 08:41.313
...kiss him.

08:41.386 --> 08:44.720
Just grab him and kiss him.

08:48.194 --> 08:50.822
Oh, my God,
I wanted to grab him and kiss him!

08:50.897 --> 08:53.661
Now, that's advanced.

09:07.580 --> 09:10.481
<i>[Man] Take a look at the map
and see what's in store for</i>

09:10.550 --> 09:12.313
<i>the country for the next few days.</i>

09:12.385 --> 09:15.115
<i>We have a low-pressure settling...</i>

09:24.597 --> 09:26.895
- What?
- Are you gonna be done soon?

09:26.966 --> 09:29.491
'Cause Wolf Blitzer's about to start.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.332
- I'll do my own dishes.
- Right,

09:31.404 --> 09:35.033
maybe when you get home from
work tonight, if I'm lucky.

09:35.107 --> 09:37.769
More like six days from now
when a crust has formed.

09:37.843 --> 09:40.812
If it's that important to you
to do my dishes, do 'em after.

09:40.913 --> 09:43.404
And then when am I
supposed to read the paper?

09:43.482 --> 09:47.350
Read the paper after the dishes.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.581
You have no concept of other people.

09:49.655 --> 09:51.885
Everyone's supposed to be
on your schedule.

09:51.958 --> 09:53.323
You don't leave the house!

09:53.392 --> 09:55.758
How is it that you're
the busiest guy I know?

09:55.861 --> 09:57.226
[Phone ringing]

09:59.098 --> 10:01.464
- See ya tonight, buddy.
- Later.

10:02.802 --> 10:06.738
Hello? Hi, Mrs. Kessler.

10:08.341 --> 10:12.175
Now? Uh, you know,
I adore your bundt cakes,

10:12.244 --> 10:14.769
but you do not need
to go to the trouble of... of...

10:16.248 --> 10:20.014
OK, I'll see you
in a few minutes. Bye.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.587
She happens to make a nice bundt cake.

10:25.658 --> 10:28.718
I mean, her glazed buttermilk
is all-time, man.

10:28.794 --> 10:31.058
Who are you talking to, creepy shut-in?

10:48.681 --> 10:53.311
Help! Help! Help! Help!

10:53.386 --> 10:55.013
Can someone help?

10:55.087 --> 10:58.386
Someone, please!

11:01.060 --> 11:02.687
Mrs. Kessler!

11:03.496 --> 11:05.521
Somebody help her!

11:15.608 --> 11:19.305
Hello, I need... I need an ambulance!

11:26.886 --> 11:30.845
- [Sputtering]
- Oh! Come on.

11:30.956 --> 11:34.915
- [Knocking on door]
- It's open, come in!

11:44.103 --> 11:47.163
Oh, it's you.

11:47.239 --> 11:48.501
How are you?

11:48.574 --> 11:51.839
I'm fine. I'm just, uh, making
a carrot cake for the Pumpkin Fest.

11:51.911 --> 11:55.244
Only the carrots
keep clogging up the...

11:55.314 --> 11:57.339
Why am I telling you my disposal woes?

11:57.416 --> 11:58.974
I don't know.

11:59.051 --> 12:00.348
What are you doing here?

12:00.419 --> 12:03.479
First off... truce?

12:04.890 --> 12:08.053
Absolutely. No more fighting.

12:08.127 --> 12:12.086
We need to be like neighboring
countries, peaceful coexistence.

12:12.198 --> 12:14.166
We might have a slight problem.

12:14.266 --> 12:17.235
One of your citizens
came to see me yesterday.

12:17.336 --> 12:19.099
- What do you mean?
- Sam.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.471
Sam came to see you?

12:22.541 --> 12:24.771
Yeah. He wanted me
to help him with a girl.

12:24.844 --> 12:26.106
Sam likes a girl?

12:26.178 --> 12:27.509
Yeah.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.013
And he came to you?

12:29.081 --> 12:33.040
Like going to learn aerodynamics from
the guy that invented the Hindenburg.

12:33.152 --> 12:34.915
Why didn't he tell me about this?

12:35.020 --> 12:38.387
Well, it's not really the kind
of things boys tell their moms.

12:38.491 --> 12:39.788
It's not?

12:39.859 --> 12:41.622
I can tell him that I can't help him.

12:41.694 --> 12:43.594
No, I don't know
why he didn't go to...

12:43.662 --> 12:46.961
Hey, did someone call
about a garbage disposal?

12:47.032 --> 12:49.057
- Garrett.
- Hey, Big Cat.

12:49.135 --> 12:50.898
Hi.

12:51.837 --> 12:54.806
Why are you here? This gonna be
a thing now that you're back?

12:54.874 --> 12:56.364
I come over and you're here?

12:56.442 --> 12:59.741
I gotta tell ya, pal, that is not
a thing I'm gonna be happy about.

12:59.812 --> 13:02.110
No, no. Not a thing. No thing.

13:02.181 --> 13:05.708
Sam has a crush on a girl
and he asked Nick to help him.

13:06.585 --> 13:08.883
He asked you to help him? Wow.

13:08.954 --> 13:12.481
We already did a Hindenburg joke,
but feel free to chime in.

13:15.961 --> 13:19.328
- I'm just gonna leave now.
- Good idea.

13:19.398 --> 13:22.265
For your future-speak,

13:22.334 --> 13:25.963
you can fail to feel the need
to just drop by here, OK?

13:26.038 --> 13:29.337
- OK
- All right.

13:33.612 --> 13:35.045
[Hannah] Help him.

13:35.181 --> 13:36.671
Excuse me?

13:36.749 --> 13:38.649
Help Sam with the girl.

13:38.717 --> 13:40.651
- [Ray] Hannah
- He came to him.

13:42.087 --> 13:43.349
He came to you.

13:45.024 --> 13:48.585
- What's her name?
- Amanda.

13:50.262 --> 13:51.524
It's a nice name.

13:59.238 --> 14:03.174
[Owen] Poor Mrs. Kessler,
lived in Knights Ridge her whole life...

14:03.242 --> 14:06.939
You know the bundt cake was invented
in 1950? By H. David Dalquist,

14:07.012 --> 14:12.746
who modified a ceramic pan
by introducing folds in the outer edge.

14:12.818 --> 14:14.979
So, what's your point?

14:15.054 --> 14:19.388
Just that one could make the case
that what H. David Dalquist began,

14:19.458 --> 14:22.791
- Mrs. Kessler perfected.
- [Doorbell]

14:22.862 --> 14:25.160
- Pizza's here!
- Come on in.

14:28.167 --> 14:31.034
- [Owen] Hey. How much?
- Sixteen.

14:31.103 --> 14:34.072
Here's twenty. Thank you.

14:35.608 --> 14:38.372
Did you hear about Mrs. Kessler, Phil?

14:38.444 --> 14:41.743
That's why we've gathered.
To honor her.

14:41.814 --> 14:44.578
This is all she left behind.

14:45.351 --> 14:46.818
She was so nice.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.845
She always called every Monday and
ordered the same thing, like clockwork.

14:50.923 --> 14:53.050
Cheese manicotti and a Caesar salad.

14:53.125 --> 14:56.253
Oh, I watched Wolf Blitzer yesterday.
You were right.

14:56.328 --> 14:58.694
He has an incomparable grasp
on current events.

14:58.797 --> 15:00.924
- Is "Wolf" his real name?
- Yes.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.764
Yes, it's his maternal
grandfather's name.

15:03.836 --> 15:06.498
[Girl] They said she died in the street.

15:06.572 --> 15:08.904
Alone in the street.

15:08.974 --> 15:12.637
She wasn't alone.

15:12.711 --> 15:15.339
She was not alone.

15:20.819 --> 15:22.286
See ya later, Phil.

15:24.957 --> 15:27.050
- [Door closes]
- [Owen] Pizza Girl's hot.

15:27.126 --> 15:29.788
- Yeah, she's nice.
- No, I didn't say "nice."

15:29.862 --> 15:32.888
- I said "hot."
- And she likes you.

15:32.965 --> 15:34.455
- Mm-hmm.
- No, she doesn't.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.558
Yes, you reclusive moron, she does.

15:36.635 --> 15:39.798
Guys, she was trying
to be kind to Mrs. Kessler.

15:39.905 --> 15:43.068
- Remember her, the reason we're here?
- [Owen] Dig in, boys.

15:43.142 --> 15:45.906
Oh, uh, none for me.
I got... I got dinner plans.

15:45.978 --> 15:47.536
With who?

15:47.613 --> 15:50.514
- It's none of your business.
- I can bet she's hot.

15:50.582 --> 15:52.482
- [Whistle blows]
- [Nick] All right.

15:52.551 --> 15:56.578
Phase one: First thing's first.
You gotta get her interest.

15:56.655 --> 15:58.020
But I don't play soccer.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.785
You don't get her interest
by doing things she likes.

16:00.859 --> 16:02.417
That makes you seem desperate.

16:02.528 --> 16:03.995
Do you have a girlfriend?

16:05.297 --> 16:07.731
We're just gonna keep
the focus on you, OK?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.825
All right, now, phase one,

16:09.902 --> 16:12.666
you want to make the time,
you gotta commit the crime.

16:12.738 --> 16:15.969
You gotta do something interesting.

16:16.041 --> 16:17.508
What's interesting?

16:17.576 --> 16:21.637
Same thing that's been interesting
to girls since the Garden of Eden,

16:21.714 --> 16:23.181
the bad boy.

16:23.248 --> 16:26.547
I love surprises. Is it chocolate?

16:26.618 --> 16:29.712
- Uh, no.
- Can it be dipped in chocolate?

16:29.788 --> 16:33.952
Well, not without a massive undertaking
involving engineers and candy makers.

16:35.361 --> 16:36.794
Is my surprise in there?

16:36.862 --> 16:38.830
Well, your surprise is there.

16:38.897 --> 16:43.527
It's a spec house we built,
and I want to take it off the market.

16:43.602 --> 16:45.536
Say the word, we move in this month.

16:46.905 --> 16:51.035
We move in? Like... Like together?

16:51.110 --> 16:53.169
Yeah! Think about
how much sense it makes.

16:53.245 --> 16:56.180
Not enough room at my place,
your place is falling apart.

16:56.248 --> 16:58.614
I have a garbage disposal
that rejects carrots.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.016
I hardly think that
constitutes falling apart.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.951
I know, but the point is it's crowded.

17:03.022 --> 17:04.489
[Sighs]

17:04.556 --> 17:08.219
Look, I know it's not easy
for Sam, with the twins.

17:08.292 --> 17:12.525
In this house, anytime I have Jasper and
Casper everyone has their own space.

17:13.464 --> 17:16.025
I think it's really sweet, Ray.
I just...

17:16.135 --> 17:19.695
Just think about it, OK?
That's... that's all I ask.

17:23.909 --> 17:26.537
- OK. OK.
- OK!

17:35.387 --> 17:38.948
Con: Sam hates Jasper and Casper.

17:39.058 --> 17:43.324
Pro: Ray's a good guy who wants to take
your relationship to the next level.

17:43.395 --> 17:48.731
Con: It feels like Ray's doing this
as a reaction to Nick coming to town.

17:48.801 --> 17:52.362
What says, "I'm not assuming this
is a date" more, a hoop or a stud?

17:52.471 --> 17:54.632
So you are going on the "maybe-date"?

17:55.441 --> 17:58.410
If I tell you who it's with,
you can't say a word.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.273
I told you I wanted to kiss Nick.

18:02.881 --> 18:04.849
What could be more
of a secret than that?

18:05.784 --> 18:06.944
Eddie Latekka!

18:07.019 --> 18:08.987
[Gasping]

18:09.088 --> 18:12.580
- Except that!
- [Janet] But why did he ask me out?

18:12.658 --> 18:14.523
He run out of thin girls to sleep with?

18:14.593 --> 18:17.323
Because you're one of
the top three people I know.

18:17.396 --> 18:21.298
Hannah, I love you, but we're
talking about Eddie Latekka.

18:21.366 --> 18:24.927
And is it a date or not a date?
How does one tell?

18:25.003 --> 18:29.531
By the goodnight kiss.
If it's on the lips, it's a date.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.304
Cheek or forehead, no date.

18:33.178 --> 18:34.736
Who are the other top two people?

18:34.847 --> 18:37.543
- Well, Sam, of course.
- And?

18:38.550 --> 18:41.417
- Caroline Garrett.
- Nick's mother?

18:42.688 --> 18:44.986
She was the best.

18:45.057 --> 18:48.288
I think about her all the time.

18:48.360 --> 18:52.888
Had she lived,
things would have been different.

18:54.399 --> 18:56.333
[Phone ringing]

18:59.872 --> 19:01.237
Hello?

19:02.674 --> 19:06.440
Yes, this is Hannah Daniels.

19:06.512 --> 19:08.571
- What?
- [Knock on door]

19:10.048 --> 19:13.677
Hi. I'm Nick Garrett. I got a call.

19:13.752 --> 19:14.912
Yes.

19:14.987 --> 19:19.219
Sam begged me... begged me...
to call you instead of his mother.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.258
Who are you?

19:23.829 --> 19:24.796
We're pals?

19:24.897 --> 19:26.592
You and a fourth-grader?

19:26.665 --> 19:28.428
- Yeah.
- [Knock on door]

19:28.534 --> 19:31.503
Of course we called his mother
as well. Come in.

19:32.504 --> 19:35.268
Hi, Mr. Harrison, I...

19:37.509 --> 19:39.033
What are you doing here?

19:39.111 --> 19:42.137
Apparently he and the ten-year-old
are, uh, great chums.

19:42.214 --> 19:43.374
What happened?

19:43.448 --> 19:45.780
Sam took it upon himself to let dozens

19:45.851 --> 19:48.615
and dozens of fruit flies
loose in the elementary school.

19:48.720 --> 19:50.483
- What?
- How did he have access

19:50.556 --> 19:52.387
to dozens and dozens of fruit flies?

19:52.457 --> 19:55.915
The second grade was conducting
the fruit fly oatmeal experiment

19:55.994 --> 20:01.626
and Sam decided
to "liberate" the fruit flies.

20:04.303 --> 20:06.134
You liberated fruit flies?

20:06.872 --> 20:10.330
Excuse me for asking
the obvious, but... why?

20:10.409 --> 20:13.344
We believe it had something
to do with impressing a girl.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.245
[Chuckles] I'm sorry.

20:17.316 --> 20:20.342
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

20:20.419 --> 20:23.320
What girl would be
impressed by fruit flies?

20:23.388 --> 20:25.549
That's not a question
I can answer, uh...

20:25.624 --> 20:27.751
I never did anything wrong before.

20:27.826 --> 20:30.090
We don't get points
for what we haven't done.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.096
- Well...
- Was the girl impressed?

20:32.164 --> 20:33.688
- Excuse me?
- Nick!

20:33.765 --> 20:38.099
I'm just curious. If we're to assume
that he did this to impress a girl,

20:38.170 --> 20:40.832
it'd be nice to know
if it had the desired effect.

20:40.906 --> 20:43.466
- I don't see how...
- Because if he did impress her,

20:43.575 --> 20:45.406
he may be inclined to do it again.

20:45.477 --> 20:47.536
- We need to know...
- To dissuade him.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.847
Sam?

20:50.916 --> 20:55.080
I think it did impress her.
She laughed... and giggled.

20:55.187 --> 20:57.849
- A laugh and a giggle?
- What's the difference?

20:57.923 --> 20:59.857
- What difference?
- Laugh and a giggle.

20:59.925 --> 21:02.860
A giggle happens
after you've realized you've...

21:02.928 --> 21:04.259
...laughed too much.

21:04.329 --> 21:05.694
A self-conscious thing.

21:05.797 --> 21:09.426
You're embarrassed for laughing,
so you devolve into a nervous giggle.

21:09.501 --> 21:12.231
- Exactly.
- Excuse me, but what are we doing here?

21:12.304 --> 21:15.398
- And I do believe there was a blush.
- A blush!

21:15.474 --> 21:18.409
Did you hear that, Principal Harrison?
There was a blush!

21:18.477 --> 21:19.569
Yes, extraordinary.

21:21.380 --> 21:22.745
I want you all to leave.

21:25.150 --> 21:26.117
Thank you.

21:29.554 --> 21:32.921
Wow! How far did we drive?

21:33.025 --> 21:36.552
- We still in Massachusetts?
- They've got the best veal scallopini.

21:36.628 --> 21:39.392
We drove through three
time zones for veal scallopini?

21:45.504 --> 21:49.463
There are a disproportionate number
of older men with younger women here.

21:51.076 --> 21:52.043
No!

21:52.144 --> 21:56.706
This place, it's where people
come for assignations.

21:56.815 --> 22:00.478
- What... What's that?
- Uh, secret romances, sneak-aways,

22:00.552 --> 22:02.679
- affairs.
- No!

22:02.754 --> 22:05.450
- It's called Hugo's Hideaway.
- It's in the woods.

22:05.524 --> 22:07.082
<i>That's a chickenlegg thing.</i>

22:07.192 --> 22:09.456
Is it an affair place
'cause it's in the woods

22:09.528 --> 22:12.497
or did they tuck it in the woods
'cause it's an affair place?

22:13.665 --> 22:17.692
Check this out. "During Prohibition,
colorful Canadian bootlegger

22:17.769 --> 22:21.296
Hugo Callahan opened The Hideaway
to entertain lady friends,

22:21.373 --> 22:24.740
far from his wife's prying eyes."

22:24.810 --> 22:26.573
It's a virtual shrine to cheating.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.646
I come for the veal scallopini.

22:32.250 --> 22:34.878
Of course, they don't have
veal scallopini.

22:35.854 --> 22:38.414
- What?
- Not on the menu, anyhow.

22:44.496 --> 22:48.626
I don't ask for much, Eddie.
Heck, I don't ask for anything.

22:48.700 --> 22:53.364
From where I'm sitting, I'm just happy
to be sitting where I'm sitting.

22:54.439 --> 22:58.705
There's only one thing
I require of my friends

22:58.777 --> 23:00.404
and that's honesty.

23:02.914 --> 23:05.815
Are we here because you're
embarrassed to be seen with me?

23:12.924 --> 23:14.357
[Woman] Have we decided?

23:14.426 --> 23:19.728
Yeah, um, would you mind explaining to
my friend here what Vito's Special is?

23:19.798 --> 23:23.757
Oh, that's our version of veal
scallopini. The best in the state.

23:23.869 --> 23:27.737
- Really? We'll have two.
- OK.

23:29.441 --> 23:31.705
- [Woman] Thank you.
- [Eddie] Thank you.

23:39.151 --> 23:42.314
[Phil] OK, here. Keep the change.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.754
- But I don't have to.
- You don't have to what?

23:45.824 --> 23:46.791
Keep the change.

23:46.892 --> 23:50.055
It's a tip. Don't you...
Don't you work for tips?

23:50.128 --> 23:52.096
Yeah, I mean, traditionally.

23:53.532 --> 23:55.625
It's just, this place.

23:57.502 --> 24:01.871
- What about it?
- It, um... struggles.

24:05.143 --> 24:07.703
Hey, um, you don't write
manifestos, do you?

24:07.813 --> 24:11.249
- What do you mean?
- Tracts. Screeds. Ideological rants.

24:11.316 --> 24:15.275
Anti-technology mantras hating
on mechanization in industrial society.

24:15.353 --> 24:18.720
I mean, you don't just
write those, do you?

24:18.790 --> 24:20.758
- No.
- I think critical perspective

24:20.859 --> 24:24.625
is really important, that's all...
for everything, you know?

24:24.729 --> 24:28.597
My dad, when he runs out of staples,
he throws out the entire stapler.

24:28.667 --> 24:33.036
I'm sorry, I go on. I just feel the need
to let conversations linger.

24:33.138 --> 24:34.696
I don't know how to end them.

24:34.806 --> 24:39.300
My friend, she says for my birthday
she's gonna get me a carton of periods.

24:40.712 --> 24:43.476
Punctuation mark,
not the menstrual cycle.

24:43.548 --> 24:46.073
God, a carton of menstrual cycles...

24:47.686 --> 24:48.983
How do you even wrap that?

24:49.554 --> 24:52.455
- I don't know.
- Yeah.

24:52.524 --> 24:57.860
Um, your pizza's getting cold, so...

24:57.929 --> 24:59.692
...um, I should go.

24:59.764 --> 25:04.133
- See ya later.
- Yeah, I'll see ya later.

25:04.769 --> 25:08.500
- Your eyes are off the hinge.
- Excuse me?

25:08.573 --> 25:14.011
They're beautiful. Just... You have
the most beautiful eyes I've ever seen,

25:14.079 --> 25:18.448
and I'm an expert
'cause I get a lot of looks.

25:22.020 --> 25:24.454
Well... so long.

25:26.024 --> 25:27.685
So long.

25:45.310 --> 25:49.747
So, um... how do you feel
about Nick moving back to town?

25:50.749 --> 25:54.185
It's a free country, people are
allowed to move where they want.

25:54.252 --> 25:55.810
[Laughs] Very generous of you.

25:55.887 --> 25:59.721
Let's try again.
How do you feel about it?

25:59.791 --> 26:01.486
I'm sore at the guy.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.085
- Was it the book?
- I never even read it.

26:04.162 --> 26:06.653
[Laughing]

26:06.731 --> 26:07.993
It's the movie, I...

26:08.733 --> 26:12.601
You remember that scene when Freddy
Venetta gets so drunk he hits the car?

26:12.671 --> 26:15.936
He's so afraid of getting in trouble,
he just takes off?

26:16.708 --> 26:19.074
That never happened.

26:19.177 --> 26:22.146
Yeah, I hit the car, but...

26:22.247 --> 26:25.114
...I stayed, and I faced
the consequences.

26:25.183 --> 26:28.949
I didn't take off... unlike some people.

26:30.455 --> 26:32.423
You know what I like about you, Eddie?

26:32.524 --> 26:35.493
You're not like the guy in the movie.

26:35.560 --> 26:37.926
You're brave, you don't run.

26:37.996 --> 26:39.861
But I also think,

26:39.931 --> 26:44.027
sometimes, a lot of that gets lost
in the shuffle of you being you.

27:03.955 --> 27:06.719
I'll see ya later, Janet.

27:06.825 --> 27:08.156
Yeah, see ya.

27:21.339 --> 27:22.670
What are you watching?

27:25.944 --> 27:27.309
Um, OK.

27:28.313 --> 27:32.443
I'm worried, on several levels.

27:32.517 --> 27:35.543
Check it out. That's Amanda!

27:35.620 --> 27:39.681
It's getting worse.
Oh, OK, all right. Is that Sam?

27:39.758 --> 27:44.388
Yeah, Yeah. Phase two,
"Nothing Attracts Like Indifference."

27:44.462 --> 27:47.989
See, he's got her attention,
but he's barely acknowledging her.

27:48.533 --> 27:52.469
I never knew I could learn so much
by watching little boys.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.165
Is my maturity being called
into question?

27:55.273 --> 27:58.174
You know, I'm doing the most
mature thing on the planet.

27:58.243 --> 28:02.009
What, playing Cyrano to a fourth-grader
who may or may not be your son?

28:02.113 --> 28:04.081
- Parenting!
- Oh, right.

28:04.182 --> 28:06.548
- How's that working out?
- It's a cakewalk.

28:06.751 --> 28:10.414
Yeah, I've heard that about kids.
They're like model trains.

28:10.488 --> 28:13.651
You know, you just put 'em
on the track, give 'em some juice,

28:13.725 --> 28:16.193
watch 'em go.

28:17.495 --> 28:19.395
Holy cow, she is into him.

28:19.464 --> 28:23.423
Tomorrow night, phase three is a go.

28:23.501 --> 28:26.527
- What's phase three?
- It's the big finish.

28:27.338 --> 28:29.568
"Rock the Stadium of Her Heart."

28:32.877 --> 28:35.903
So... have you given it
any more thought?

28:35.980 --> 28:37.948
Have I given what any more thought?

28:38.049 --> 28:40.574
- The house, the spec house.
- Ray...

28:40.652 --> 28:43.712
I know. I know you need
some time to think on it.

28:43.788 --> 28:46.552
I was wondering if you were
at least mulling it over.

28:46.658 --> 28:50.025
It's just the timing of it all
I find strange.

28:50.095 --> 28:51.528
Strange how?

28:53.298 --> 28:55.858
We've been together
for two and a half years, Ray,

28:55.934 --> 28:58.994
and in all that time,
not a peep about any of this.

28:59.070 --> 29:01.402
It was only a month ago
that a toothbrush of yours

29:01.473 --> 29:05.500
finally declared permanent residency
in my medicine chest.

29:06.177 --> 29:09.442
So, why the sudden urgency
to move in together?

29:09.514 --> 29:13.780
I'm tired of packing an overnight bag
three nights a week to sleep here,

29:13.852 --> 29:16.878
two miles down the road.

29:16.955 --> 29:20.254
And I'm tired of waking up alone
those other four mornings.

29:20.325 --> 29:22.691
You know what really
buckles me, Hannah?

29:22.794 --> 29:26.423
I remember the day that my toothbrush
took up permanent residency

29:26.498 --> 29:28.659
in your medicine chest.

29:28.767 --> 29:31.395
'Cause you were so damn happy.

29:31.469 --> 29:34.836
You welcomed that toothbrush
with open arms and now,

29:34.906 --> 29:37.431
all you want is to serve it
with an eviction notice.

29:40.612 --> 29:44.173
And my toothbrush and I
just want to know why.

29:49.187 --> 29:51.747
Can't believe you're not
gonna be with us to help Sam

29:51.823 --> 29:54.189
- "rock the stadium of her heart."
- I know.

29:54.259 --> 29:56.193
I wish I could be a part of it.

29:56.261 --> 29:58.559
Well, it's not gonna be
the same without you.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.599
- Can I ask you something?
- Yeah, what is it?

30:01.666 --> 30:05.363
- Pizza Girl. What do I say?
- You're asking me for advice?

30:05.436 --> 30:07.927
Why not? I mean,
what you and Alison have,

30:08.006 --> 30:09.974
that's something to aspire to.

30:10.041 --> 30:12.066
Oh, thanks, man.

30:12.143 --> 30:14.407
I haven't been with a girl
in over six years.

30:14.479 --> 30:17.971
If it wasn't for Sunday waffles
with Eddie's Saturday take-homes,

30:18.049 --> 30:20.609
I would have no contact
with the female species.

30:20.718 --> 30:23.687
Which is why Pizza Girl is exciting...

30:23.755 --> 30:26.519
...except for the one obstacle.

30:26.591 --> 30:28.354
I'm a shut-in?

30:28.426 --> 30:30.326
I haven't played the game in a while,

30:30.395 --> 30:32.955
but my gut tells me
we don't lead with that.

30:35.500 --> 30:38.025
[Laughing and chatter]

30:59.624 --> 31:01.854
Is Pumpkin Fest
everything you remembered?

31:01.926 --> 31:04.622
And more. How you doing?

31:04.696 --> 31:06.527
Great.

31:06.598 --> 31:09.533
The other day at the principal's office,
that was, um...

31:09.601 --> 31:11.330
Fun?

31:11.402 --> 31:16.135
- Yeah, it was. It was fun.
- Little bit? Yeah.

31:16.207 --> 31:18.232
- Hello.
- Hi.

31:18.309 --> 31:20.470
- Hi!
- Have you two met?

31:21.212 --> 31:23.737
Aubrey, Hannah. Hannah, Aubrey.

31:23.815 --> 31:26.545
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

31:27.719 --> 31:31.018
- Aubrey's one of my students.
- Oh.

31:32.790 --> 31:35.953
Were there always this many pumpkins
at Pumpkin Fest?

31:42.533 --> 31:47.197
Yeah, one large pie, extra feta.

31:49.974 --> 31:53.842
I'm, uh, just here to get
some fried dough, don't mind me.

31:53.912 --> 31:58.815
Good. Wouldn't want anyone thinking
you and I have a reason to talk.

31:58.883 --> 32:01.317
Yeah, word might get out.

32:01.386 --> 32:05.015
Guess we'll have to keep
sneaking around.

32:05.089 --> 32:06.954
I know a place in Denver, Colorado.

32:07.025 --> 32:09.926
Has a chicken marsala, knock you blue.

32:09.994 --> 32:13.521
Yeah? Make a reservation.

32:20.905 --> 32:24.636
Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

32:25.243 --> 32:27.609
In the back, you're gonna
wanna move to the front.

32:27.712 --> 32:29.441
You're not gonna wanna miss this.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.583
Come on up. Come on, don't be shy.

32:33.952 --> 32:36.921
We'd like to do a little number here

32:37.021 --> 32:40.184
for somebody very, very special.

32:45.697 --> 32:48.666
<i>[# Boston: Amanda]</i>

32:51.569 --> 32:55.061
[Mouthing words]

33:12.724 --> 33:16.820
Didn't Nick do this to you
at Pumpkin Fest our sophomore year?

33:16.894 --> 33:20.057
- A Hootie & The Blowfish song.
- Right.

33:33.911 --> 33:38.177
- [Phil] Hey.
- Hey. A large pie, extra feta.

33:38.249 --> 33:39.375
That would be me.

33:45.056 --> 33:47.684
Um, you want the change?

33:47.759 --> 33:49.226
No, thanks.

33:58.603 --> 33:59.570
Thanks.

34:52.690 --> 34:56.820
Hey, hey, buddy. Hey, hey, buddy.

34:56.893 --> 34:59.328
It's OK, it's OK. Hey, hey, hey.

34:59.397 --> 35:03.094
Oh, what? Are? You're not gonna cry,
are ya? Are you gonna cry?

35:03.167 --> 35:05.101
Oh, don't...

35:06.204 --> 35:07.899
- Do you want a corn dog?
- No.

35:07.972 --> 35:09.906
- It's gonna be all right.
- No, it's not.

35:09.974 --> 35:13.466
I don't know how to do these things
and no girls are ever gonna like me.

35:13.544 --> 35:14.841
[Hannah] Honey.

35:17.582 --> 35:20.415
- Let's get you home, baby.
- Hannah, I'm sorry.

35:20.485 --> 35:23.977
For what? It's my fault.

35:24.055 --> 35:27.491
Janet's gonna take you to the car, OK?
I'll be right there.

35:27.558 --> 35:29.389
Hey...

35:32.263 --> 35:35.323
"Rock the Stadium of Her Heart,"
from your book?

35:35.399 --> 35:37.560
It's what it did for you,
remember? Hootie?

35:37.635 --> 35:40.195
We were 16, Nick, they're ten.

35:40.304 --> 35:43.171
- There's a huge difference.
- I see that now. I'm sorry.

35:43.241 --> 35:45.402
Please don't apologize.

35:45.476 --> 35:47.410
- I'm the problem.
- No.

35:47.478 --> 35:49.173
The problem isn't you acting 16,

35:49.247 --> 35:51.807
it's that I've been acting 16
since you came back.

35:53.851 --> 35:56.786
My judgment gets clouded
and I can't let that happen.

35:56.854 --> 36:00.415
He's gonna be OK. He's gonna be OK.

36:00.491 --> 36:03.756
Ten years ago,
you really blew my world, Nick.

36:03.828 --> 36:06.797
I can't allow you to do that again.

36:06.898 --> 36:09.867
Not to me and not to my son.

Han... Hannah...

36:21.846 --> 36:23.006
[doorbell rings]

36:23.948 --> 36:27.076
Hi. They said you called to complain
there wasn't enough feta?

36:27.151 --> 36:29.312
No, that pizza had plenty of feta on it.

36:29.387 --> 36:32.550
I... I called you back because I was,

36:32.623 --> 36:35.183
uh, wondering if you'd like
to go in sometime?

36:35.960 --> 36:37.825
- "Go in"?
- It's like going out,

36:37.895 --> 36:40.796
only you do it here.

36:42.400 --> 36:46.894
So, what they say is true?

36:47.438 --> 36:49.497
What do they say?

36:50.708 --> 36:52.005
You don't leave.

36:53.578 --> 36:56.411
Yes, it's true, I don't.

36:57.248 --> 36:58.715
Mrs. Kessler told me.

36:58.783 --> 37:00.717
She did? I can't believe she narced.

37:00.785 --> 37:03.652
All those years I pretended
to love those bundt cakes.

37:03.721 --> 37:09.353
She said, in this day and age, when
it's impossible to count on anyone...

37:10.561 --> 37:14.053
...what's better than knowing
there's a guy who'll always be there?

37:15.666 --> 37:18.999
- She said that?
- She did.

37:21.205 --> 37:25.107
Well, um, I gotta get back to work,

37:25.776 --> 37:29.041
but you should ask me in sometime.

37:30.281 --> 37:31.646
I will.

37:33.951 --> 37:36.852
And you should know
I don't even eat pizza.

37:37.955 --> 37:40.014
I'm lactose intolerant.

37:40.091 --> 37:42.855
Mrs. Kessler told me that, too.

37:43.961 --> 37:48.330
Wow, she was like Serpico.

37:48.966 --> 37:51.059
[Man] Yeah, let me get
another bag for it.

37:56.507 --> 37:59.965
So, it's not a cakewalk, per se,

38:00.044 --> 38:03.013
but it doesn't mean
you don't have good instincts.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.049
Look, here's the thing about kids.

38:06.117 --> 38:08.278
It's all about the take-away.

38:08.352 --> 38:11.048
Sam's gonna take away
two things from today.

38:11.122 --> 38:13.989
One, his first heartbreak.

38:14.058 --> 38:17.027
There's nothing you can do
about that, happens to everyone.

38:17.128 --> 38:20.564
Two, you tried and he knows that.

38:20.631 --> 38:23.361
He knows that you care.

Oh, I was there the day you did it
for Hannah, when we were 16.

39:31.936 --> 39:33.836
Not sure what you're talking about.

- She did?
- Yeah.

39:50.154 --> 39:52.714
Uh, she said it was 'cause of Sam.

39:52.823 --> 39:55.792
Said it's 'cause she wasn't ready
to move in together.

39:55.893 --> 39:59.260
I mean, she gave me
every reason under the sun...

40:00.030 --> 40:02.726
...except the real one...

40:02.800 --> 40:03.824
...which is you.

40:03.901 --> 40:09.533
If you hadn't come back, I would be
moving into a new house right now.

And the kids know that and...

40:22.019 --> 40:25.113
But all of us knowing that,
that doesn't mean nothing.

40:29.326 --> 40:32.489
I tell you what, your next book

40:32.563 --> 40:34.428
can be about a guy
who comes back home

40:34.498 --> 40:36.932

by the local contractor.

this one can be non-fiction,

feeling so much pressure.

41:22.813 --> 41:25.043
