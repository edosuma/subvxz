01:18.576 --> 01:21.346
I'll see you ladies later.

01:21.379 --> 01:23.816
Now when I get to be mayor
next election,

01:23.849 --> 01:27.587
I'm going to get better
accommodations for you ladies.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.489
Get on outta here,
you old drunk.

01:29.522 --> 01:34.359
But I will.

01:34.393 --> 01:37.296
Why don't you watch
where you're going, buddy?

01:43.936 --> 01:47.874
-Hello, mayor.
-Mr. lawler! How are you?

01:47.906 --> 01:49.841
All right, I guess.

01:49.875 --> 01:53.112
Looks like you're doing
a lot better than I am.

01:56.549 --> 02:00.520
Hello, mayor.
Play you a tune?

02:06.191 --> 02:09.895
Right.

02:09.929 --> 02:12.731
It's a little early to be getting
a face full, isn't it, Caleb?

02:12.764 --> 02:15.367
I was just playing
a game of cards, ambrose.

02:15.401 --> 02:18.403
I'm as sober
as a proverbial judge.

02:18.437 --> 02:21.439
Well, I've yet to meet
a sober judge.

02:21.473 --> 02:23.176
Where are you off to now?

02:23.209 --> 02:25.745
I thought I'd go down to
barrell top for a cup of coffee.

02:25.777 --> 02:27.712
Well, I sure hope
it's coffee.

02:27.746 --> 02:31.850
Your breath smells like
the inside of a bottle.

02:31.883 --> 02:35.687
Don't leave too quickly
there, doctor.

02:35.721 --> 02:37.423
You almost forgot
to pay the house

02:37.455 --> 02:40.292
for that unfortunate run
of cards you just had.

02:40.325 --> 02:42.561
Well, Mr. Pritz,
I, well,

02:42.594 --> 02:44.729
I assumed my good credit
would stand today.

02:44.763 --> 02:47.366
I'll make good tomorrow.

02:47.399 --> 02:49.936
You know this good credit
you keep talking of?

02:49.968 --> 02:52.737
It's getting less and less
by the hour, doctor.

02:52.770 --> 02:54.973
I suggest you don't
let it run out.

02:55.007 --> 02:59.512
You remember that discussion
we had just the other day?

02:59.544 --> 03:01.680
How are we doing today,
gentlemen?

03:01.713 --> 03:04.516
Just passing the time, sheriff,
just passing the time.

03:04.550 --> 03:07.453
I could see that, Mr. Pritz.

03:10.556 --> 03:12.892
You okay, doc?

03:12.925 --> 03:16.829
Of course I am.
If you'll both excuse me.

03:21.532 --> 03:24.436
Damn it, Harlan, why you gotta
call him out in public like that?

03:24.469 --> 03:26.605
And in front of mayor Taylor,
for god's sakes?

03:26.639 --> 03:29.975
Does the where and the when
really matter, Tom?

03:30.008 --> 03:33.512
It just don't look right. I mean, you
know, doc moss might not be much,

03:33.544 --> 03:35.881
but, you know,
he is a council member.

03:35.913 --> 03:38.917
Which is the only reason why he's ain't
walking around on sticks right now.

03:38.950 --> 03:42.287
He owes me plenty, Tom,
and my Patience is wearing thin.

03:42.320 --> 03:43.855
So cut him off
from the table.

03:43.889 --> 03:46.759
That cash cow? Not a chance.

03:46.792 --> 03:48.995
Sooner or later,
I'm gonna get my due.

03:51.997 --> 03:55.534
Remember, sheriff,
the more money I make,

03:55.567 --> 03:57.704
the more money you make.

04:09.580 --> 04:12.717
Afternoon, ambrose.
Pete.

04:12.751 --> 04:15.621
Sheriff, sorry I didn't speak
to you back there.

04:15.653 --> 04:17.822
I was,
in a bit of a hurry.

04:17.855 --> 04:21.293
Yeah, so I saw.

04:21.326 --> 04:25.398
Glad to see you finally made it
here to keep Pete company.

04:25.430 --> 04:26.931
So business that slow, Pete?

04:26.964 --> 04:28.566
You're looking pretty
comfortable in that chair.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.536
Claire can take care
of business.

04:30.569 --> 04:34.340
-Now ambrose and I are...
-Ahem! Mayor Taylor.

04:34.372 --> 04:36.875
Pardon me, mayor Taylor and I
were discussing the agenda

04:36.908 --> 04:38.444
of the next
town council meeting.

04:38.476 --> 04:39.811
I think that's just
about as important

04:39.845 --> 04:43.816
as selling candy and dresses.
Almost anyways.

04:43.848 --> 04:46.319
You got it all figured out,
do you?

04:46.351 --> 04:51.524
Yeah, well, Pete's making it more
complicated than need be as usual.

04:51.557 --> 04:56.062
I was just saying it's about time
we appoint a real treasurer.

04:56.095 --> 04:58.931
For goodness sakes, ambrose,
you got enough to do

04:58.963 --> 05:01.600
without trying to balance
the town books, too.

05:01.632 --> 05:04.336
And about them books.

05:04.370 --> 05:07.406
Pete, I agree.
We should have a treasurer.

05:07.439 --> 05:10.042
But until we do, I am more
than capable of doing it my...

05:10.074 --> 05:12.745
Sheriff Ramey! Sheriff!

05:12.778 --> 05:14.045
What is it, Henry?

05:14.079 --> 05:16.514
There's been a shooting
at my hotel.

05:16.548 --> 05:18.817
-What? Who's shot?
-Just come quick.

05:18.850 --> 05:20.786
I have to get back.
Camille's room.

05:22.019 --> 05:23.855
Camille? Who?

05:23.889 --> 05:27.492
Camille Tammery. Danny holt's
done shot her husband.

05:27.526 --> 05:30.463
Pete,
go get doc moss, quick.

05:31.538 --> 05:38.745
<b>WESTERN WORLD</b>

05:39.090 --> 05:42.590
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

05:47.745 --> 05:48.647
Two.

05:56.622 --> 05:57.523
Cards, doc?

06:00.192 --> 06:02.095
Give me three.

06:10.201 --> 06:11.103
Call.

06:13.439 --> 06:14.140
Call.

06:16.841 --> 06:19.077
Doc, in our out?

06:24.016 --> 06:26.951
I'm out, damn it.

06:26.985 --> 06:29.788
Doc, maybe you ought
to quit betting for a while.

06:29.822 --> 06:32.024
At least until you get
some money to bet with.

06:32.057 --> 06:33.826
I assure you...

06:33.858 --> 06:36.829
You've assured me
for the last time, Caleb moss.

06:36.862 --> 06:38.831
Take your business
down to Harlan Pritz.

06:38.863 --> 06:40.498
He doesn't seem
to give a damn,

06:40.531 --> 06:42.734
but I don't want you
getting any deeper...

06:42.767 --> 06:45.670
Doc, someone's been shot
at Henry's hotel.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.980
I don't know what
I'm gonna do with you.

06:56.014 --> 06:57.182
Damn.

06:57.216 --> 06:58.718
Check on that man, Caleb.

07:04.122 --> 07:08.828
Hand me the mirror
off that table there, Henry.

07:08.860 --> 07:12.730
-Is he dead?
-Who is he?

07:12.764 --> 07:15.533
According to Mrs. Tammery there,
his name is George.

07:15.567 --> 07:17.203
He's my husband.

07:17.235 --> 07:22.574
Well, my condolences,
Mrs. Tammery.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.643
He's a dead husband now.

07:47.598 --> 07:50.735
What the hell were you thinking,
boy, being in that woman's room?

07:53.237 --> 07:55.641
We love each other.

07:55.673 --> 07:59.245
-And then her husband...
-Quiet.

07:59.278 --> 08:02.581
You stay quiet, you hear me?

08:02.613 --> 08:04.816
Don't say a word to anyone.

08:04.850 --> 08:08.587
Let me figure this out.

08:08.620 --> 08:12.958
I'm the only hope
you got, Danny.

08:12.990 --> 08:15.894
I'll get you out of this
if I can.

08:24.101 --> 08:26.604
Well, good morning.
How'd you sleep?

08:26.637 --> 08:30.209
Like a rock as always, al.
You got anything for me?

08:30.242 --> 08:33.613
Yes, sir.
Just came in from laramie.

08:35.947 --> 08:39.683
So we're here one night,
and gone again this morning?

08:39.717 --> 08:43.121
Well, it appears so.
Thank you.

08:43.154 --> 08:45.057
Is there a reply?

08:45.090 --> 08:48.326
Yeah. Tell 'em I'm
headed to dogwood pass.

08:48.360 --> 08:50.262
-I'll get this right out.
-All right, thank you.

08:50.294 --> 08:53.198
-See you next time.
-I expect so.

09:47.284 --> 09:48.786
Evening.

09:48.820 --> 09:51.156
Can I stable my horse here
for the night?

09:51.188 --> 09:53.024
Sure. Just for tonight?

09:53.057 --> 09:56.128
-More than likely.
-Name's Jeremy Carver.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.929
This is my place.
Your name?

09:57.962 --> 09:59.163
Moses white.

09:59.197 --> 10:02.234
Elizabeth?

10:02.267 --> 10:04.703
Take this man's horse inside
and bed him down.

10:04.735 --> 10:08.807
Yes, sir. Would you like him brushed
down? It's only for a penny extra.

10:08.840 --> 10:11.110
Sure. I'll tell you what.

10:11.143 --> 10:13.177
You do a good job,
I'll give you two pennies.

10:13.211 --> 10:14.879
Thanks.

10:17.014 --> 10:18.750
Quite the little businesslady
you got there.

10:18.783 --> 10:21.953
Well, she did learn
from the best.

10:21.986 --> 10:23.788
Now, you'll be staying
at Mr. Mannors' hotel tonight?

10:23.822 --> 10:26.924
Well, if that's Mr. Mannors'
place, I guess I will.

10:26.957 --> 10:28.927
I'll see you in the morning
around breakfast time.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.830
-I'll be here.
-What do I owe you?

10:31.863 --> 10:33.699
We can settle up
in the morning.

10:33.731 --> 10:35.134
Well, you're a trusting soul,
Mr. Carver.

10:35.167 --> 10:37.702
Well, somebody in this town
has to be.

10:39.236 --> 10:41.807
All right, then.
We'll see you in the morning.

10:43.375 --> 10:46.979
You don't have to go
no further, mister.

10:47.011 --> 10:49.447
We got bed and bath for you
right up here.

10:49.480 --> 10:53.418
Whiskey, too, and the prettiest
damn girls in the whole territory.

10:56.988 --> 11:00.826
I guess we didn't tickle
his fancy.

11:00.859 --> 11:03.028
I'm to tired for a fancy
tickling tonight anyway.

11:06.798 --> 11:09.400
All right, sir.
Have you got this?

11:09.433 --> 11:10.868
I can slow it down
if you want.

11:10.902 --> 11:12.403
Now, don't you worry
about me.

11:12.437 --> 11:14.773
I'm quick as a snake
and I got eyes like a hawk.

11:14.806 --> 11:16.408
All righty, then.

11:16.441 --> 11:19.278
Which is it?

11:22.480 --> 11:24.817
I got you this time.
Care to try again?

11:24.850 --> 11:26.451
Hell, no. I'm done.

11:29.254 --> 11:30.956
Would you care to try, sir?

11:30.989 --> 11:33.793
Are you as quick as a snake
with eyes like a hawk?

11:38.129 --> 11:41.399
All righty, then.
It's a very simple thing really.

11:41.432 --> 11:44.202
Just follow it as closely
as you possibly can.

11:44.235 --> 11:45.770
No trickery here,

11:45.803 --> 11:48.139
just some old peas
and a little old pebble.

11:52.510 --> 11:55.413
It's the middle one.

11:55.447 --> 11:57.316
This one?

11:57.349 --> 12:00.920
That's it.

12:13.130 --> 12:15.266
Would you care to add
to your bet and try again?

12:21.907 --> 12:24.209
You want to try?

12:24.241 --> 12:27.045
Come on.
How about you?

12:40.091 --> 12:43.294
What more evidence
do you need?

12:43.327 --> 12:44.362
Everyone just be quiet
for a minute.

12:44.395 --> 12:46.998
I just don't understand.

12:47.032 --> 12:49.401
I said quiet, damn it!

12:53.605 --> 12:55.206
Well? We're waiting.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.109
Well, look,
now I understand

12:57.142 --> 12:59.211
everyone's upset
by all that's happened.

12:59.244 --> 13:01.213
After all,
it's not every day

13:01.245 --> 13:05.350
a fella gets himself shot
in Henry Mannors' hotel.

13:05.383 --> 13:07.152
But we've gotta keep
cool heads,

13:07.184 --> 13:08.553
see things the way they are.

13:11.288 --> 13:13.925
Tom, we've gone over this.

13:13.958 --> 13:16.594
There's nothing more
to consider.

13:16.628 --> 13:20.165
Ambrose, would it kill
you to call me sheriff Ramey

13:20.197 --> 13:22.433
during official proceedings?

13:22.466 --> 13:24.269
Are these official
proceedings?

13:24.302 --> 13:26.305
Well, we're in my jail
discussing a murder,

13:26.337 --> 13:29.274
so I would say yes,
these are official proceedings.

13:29.307 --> 13:32.177
Fine, then call me mayor Taylor
and not ambrose.

13:32.210 --> 13:35.047
Sweet Jesus.

13:35.080 --> 13:38.350
Must you men argue
about names?

13:38.383 --> 13:41.253
My husband is dead,
after all,

13:41.285 --> 13:44.055
and I would like to see
some sort of resolution

13:44.089 --> 13:47.459
before old age dictates
that I join him.

13:47.491 --> 13:51.128
My apologies, Mrs. Tammery.

13:51.162 --> 13:53.098
Both ambrose and I,
we're determined to...

13:53.130 --> 13:55.100
Ahem.

13:55.133 --> 13:56.634
Both mayor Taylor and I,

13:56.668 --> 13:58.269
we're determined to resolve
this matter

13:58.302 --> 14:01.539
with the utmost urgency.

14:01.572 --> 14:05.343
We've got young Danny holt locked
up in that cell right there.

14:05.376 --> 14:08.145
He's just 19 years old, and he's
waiting for a U.S. Marshall

14:08.178 --> 14:10.314
to come and take him
to laramie to stand trial,

14:10.347 --> 14:12.350
so I'd like to
make reasonably sure

14:12.384 --> 14:14.452
I've got the right suspect
in custody.

14:14.485 --> 14:18.490
And, well, that demands closer
examination of the facts.

14:18.523 --> 14:21.526
You and I both saw him
in the room with Mrs. Tammery,

14:21.558 --> 14:25.663
her unfortunate husband
dead on the floor.

14:25.697 --> 14:28.133
What more proof do you need?

14:28.166 --> 14:29.902
And besides, we've already
sent for the Marshall

14:29.934 --> 14:31.569
to take him
to laramie for a trial.

14:31.602 --> 14:35.406
You did that, ambrose?
After I asked you not to?

14:35.440 --> 14:37.009
I told you I wanted
to look into it more.

14:37.042 --> 14:39.543
Look into what?
The boy is guilty.

14:39.576 --> 14:43.048
You just have to accept it.
He's the one...

14:49.553 --> 14:51.656
-Can I help you?
-You the town sheriff?

14:51.690 --> 14:53.659
I'm sheriff Ramey, yes.

14:53.692 --> 14:56.695
Well, I suppose you can help me.
I'm Moses white.

14:56.727 --> 14:58.462
Now hold on a moment, sheriff.

14:58.495 --> 15:00.698
Whatever business this man
may have, it can wait.

15:00.731 --> 15:02.433
No offense, stranger.

15:02.466 --> 15:04.369
We've got more important issues
here we need to discuss.

15:04.402 --> 15:06.405
We need to continue
to discuss them.

15:06.437 --> 15:09.006
Henry has a point. We shan't
be interrupted in this.

15:09.039 --> 15:11.275
Look, I'll handle this.

15:11.308 --> 15:14.679
Mr. White, is your business
urgent in nature?

15:14.712 --> 15:16.647
Well, I supposed that depends
on your notion of urgent.

15:16.681 --> 15:18.684
Well, by urgent,
I mean severely urgent.

15:18.716 --> 15:21.620
Has there been an immediate
killing or robbery, for instance?

15:21.653 --> 15:24.089
'Cause that's about the only thing
that could possibly take precedence

15:24.121 --> 15:26.958
over the business
we're presently discussing.

15:26.991 --> 15:29.527
Well, no, not immediate
as in just this second.

15:29.561 --> 15:31.562
Okay, well, would you mind
having a seat then

15:31.596 --> 15:33.298
till I can talk to you?

15:33.331 --> 15:36.999
Or you can leave and come
back later, your choice.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.037
Shouldn't be long.

15:39.070 --> 15:41.974
-Chair's fine, I suppose.
-All right, then.

15:45.442 --> 15:49.146
Now look,
let's recount what happened.

15:49.179 --> 15:52.350
I just need to hear it again,
'cause I need to put my finger

15:52.384 --> 15:55.220
on what's bothering me about it,
what I'm missing.

15:55.253 --> 15:58.223
So, Mrs. Tammery, you were in your
room conversing with Danny holt?

15:58.255 --> 15:59.658
That is correct.

15:59.691 --> 16:02.995
I had hired Danny
to drive my buggy for me

16:03.028 --> 16:05.129
so that I could look
at a plot of land

16:05.163 --> 16:08.033
that I was considering
for purchase.

16:08.066 --> 16:11.302
When we returned, I asked Danny
to come up to my room

16:11.336 --> 16:14.172
so that I could pay him
for his time.

16:14.205 --> 16:16.508
And that's when Mr. Tammery
arrived at the hotel?

16:16.541 --> 16:20.412
Yes, Tammery came in and
introduced himself as Camille's...

16:20.445 --> 16:22.214
Mrs. Tammery's husband,

16:22.246 --> 16:24.482
who then inquired as to whether
or not she was at the hotel,

16:24.515 --> 16:28.319
so I of course
directed him on to her room.

16:28.352 --> 16:30.254
And he went directly
to your door?

16:30.288 --> 16:35.494
Yes. He came right in
and he grabbed me.

16:35.527 --> 16:38.397
Took me rather by surprise.

16:38.429 --> 16:43.367
George and I had separated,
as I had told you earlier.

16:43.400 --> 16:46.537
He followed me here
from rawlins

16:46.571 --> 16:49.307
with the intent
on reconciling.

16:49.340 --> 16:53.177
-And you argued?
-Yes.

16:53.211 --> 16:57.182
Like I said, George wanted me
to return with him to rawlins.

16:57.215 --> 17:00.585
But I had told him,
and in no uncertain terms,

17:00.618 --> 17:04.155
that I was no longer
in love with him.

17:04.189 --> 17:08.826
And the two of you discussed this
right there in front of Danny holt?

17:08.858 --> 17:12.229
George was so intent
on his purpose

17:12.262 --> 17:16.634
that I do not think he even saw
Danny standing there in the corner.

17:16.666 --> 17:20.237
I admit, I almost forgot
about him myself.

17:20.270 --> 17:22.640
And when I did think of him,

17:22.673 --> 17:25.810
I decided that it was probably a
very good idea that he was there.

17:25.844 --> 17:29.480
-As a witness.
-A witness?

17:29.513 --> 17:34.251
Yes. George was excitable.

17:34.285 --> 17:39.091
He had been physical with me
before when his temper was high,

17:39.124 --> 17:42.493
something that I had told you
before in confidence, Henry,

17:42.527 --> 17:45.864
and yet you saw fit
to send him to my room.

17:45.896 --> 17:48.332
I'm very disappointed
in you.

17:48.365 --> 17:51.103
Very disappointed.

17:51.135 --> 17:53.605
I'm sorry.
I didn't think.

17:53.637 --> 17:54.839
No, you did not.

17:54.873 --> 17:58.210
What happened then,
Mrs. Tammery?

17:58.242 --> 18:00.644
I have told you this.

18:00.678 --> 18:03.248
Must I go through
this questioning again?

18:03.280 --> 18:07.318
Well, once more,
if you don't mind.

18:07.352 --> 18:12.524
George became enraged,
as he was wont to do.

18:12.557 --> 18:16.694
Danny shouted for him to stop
and grabbed at his arm.

18:16.728 --> 18:20.731
George was much larger than
Danny and easily threw him off.

18:23.300 --> 18:26.437
He grabbed me
and threw me to the floor.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.543
He advanced on Danny and...

18:31.576 --> 18:33.377
Danny shot him.

18:42.686 --> 18:46.790
I screamed, and I think
I may have swooned.

18:46.824 --> 18:48.627
Twice?

18:48.660 --> 18:50.896
No, once.
Who swoons twice?

18:50.929 --> 18:53.230
No, I mean,
Danny holt shot him twice.

18:53.263 --> 18:55.733
Yes.

18:55.767 --> 18:58.870
I suppose he must have.
Yes.

18:58.903 --> 19:03.607
Camille Tammery saw Danny holt
shoot her husband dead.

19:03.641 --> 19:06.644
You and I found Danny
at the scene ourselves,

19:06.678 --> 19:08.613
his gun in his hand.

19:08.645 --> 19:11.682
I know, but something doesn't
feel quite right about it.

19:11.715 --> 19:13.918
What'd he shoot him with?

19:13.951 --> 19:17.756
-Excuse me?
-The weapon, what was it?

19:17.788 --> 19:19.490
It was a Colt .45

19:19.523 --> 19:21.725
.45 caliber?

19:21.759 --> 19:23.929
Yeah, so?

19:23.961 --> 19:26.397
Where were you at this time?

19:26.431 --> 19:28.200
Down at the desk
in the lobby.

19:28.232 --> 19:32.203
Just downstairs from where
Mrs. Tammery lost her husband?

19:32.237 --> 19:34.739
That would be correct, yeah.

19:34.771 --> 19:38.843
And you,
you heard the shots?

19:40.678 --> 19:44.449
-I beg your pardon?
-Help yourself.

19:44.481 --> 19:46.718
You'll have to forgive me,
Mr. Mannors.

19:46.750 --> 19:51.522
The smell of fresh coffee
got the better of me.

19:51.556 --> 19:55.693
I wondered if you'd,

19:55.727 --> 19:58.663
heard the shots from where
you were down in the lobby.

19:58.695 --> 20:00.865
I heard the commotion.
There were screams.

20:00.897 --> 20:05.536
But you did not hear the reports
from the young man's pistol?

20:05.569 --> 20:08.373
I don't know. I...

20:08.405 --> 20:12.644
The, Colt .45
is very a powerful handgun,

20:12.676 --> 20:15.312
yet you didn't hear
the reports

20:15.346 --> 20:16.948
just a floor below
Mrs. Tammery's room.

20:16.980 --> 20:18.883
Well, I might have.
I'm not sure.

20:18.915 --> 20:20.951
Why are you so interested
in this anyway?

20:20.984 --> 20:22.953
As far as I'm concerned, this
affair is none of your business.

20:22.987 --> 20:25.023
Who was the first person in the
room after the shots were fired?

20:25.056 --> 20:27.625
-Would that be you also?
-Yes. I own the hotel.

20:27.659 --> 20:31.329
I went up immediately. -When you
heard the commotion, not the shots.

20:31.362 --> 20:33.365
I don't remember hearing
the damn shots!

20:33.397 --> 20:36.267
What the hell?
Who is this man?

20:36.300 --> 20:39.537
Well, I'm the Marshall
y'all are waiting for.

20:39.569 --> 20:41.438
Well, that can't be.

20:41.471 --> 20:43.607
We just wired the Marshall's
office in laramie yesterday.

20:43.641 --> 20:46.311
I didn't come here from laramie.
I came from rawlins.

20:46.344 --> 20:48.947
-It's much closer.
-Excuse me?

20:48.980 --> 20:52.616
Well, you all wired the
Marshall's office in laramie,

20:52.650 --> 20:55.487
and they wired me in rawlins
knowing I'd be there,

20:55.519 --> 20:58.355
and, well, I came here.
Simple.

20:58.388 --> 21:00.791
My apologies.
I just didn't expect...

21:00.825 --> 21:04.062
Look here, you could have identified
yourself as soon as you got here.

21:04.095 --> 21:08.333
Well, you told me to take a seat
and wait my turn,

21:08.365 --> 21:10.035
so I... I did.

21:10.067 --> 21:11.970
Besides, I wanted to hear
the story.

21:12.002 --> 21:14.338
Well, you have.

21:14.372 --> 21:16.408
Almost.

21:16.441 --> 21:19.576
I wonder what your
prisoner has to say.

21:19.609 --> 21:21.812
I hardly heard him breathe
since I've been here.

21:21.846 --> 21:25.650
Well, so far Danny holt
hadn't said a word about it.

21:25.682 --> 21:27.618
Not a single word.

21:27.652 --> 21:30.755
Ain't that odd.

21:30.788 --> 21:33.924
You know the boy, sheriff?
He been much trouble before?

21:33.958 --> 21:37.929
No, just the usual
boy mischief.

21:37.961 --> 21:39.897
You surprised
he killed a man?

21:39.931 --> 21:43.517
Very. I mean, he's had a
hard life by some standards,

21:43.518 --> 21:45.403
having no folks and all,
but, you know,

21:45.435 --> 21:48.339
he does odd jobs,
stays out of trouble.

21:48.373 --> 21:50.408
Odd jobs?
What sort of odd jobs?

21:50.441 --> 21:52.844
Well, he runs errands, deliveries,
you know, that type of thing.

21:52.876 --> 21:56.047
Does more around here to help
the sheriff than anyone.

21:56.079 --> 22:00.050
Sweeps up, looks after the place
when Tom's on his rounds.

22:00.084 --> 22:04.355
Even brings meals to the sheriff
and any prisoners.

22:04.388 --> 22:06.457
You've taken him
under your wing?

22:06.490 --> 22:08.759
The sheriff is to be commended,
Marshall.

22:08.792 --> 22:11.829
Danny holt never knew
his father.

22:11.863 --> 22:15.100
As his mother, Molly holt,
never put a name to him

22:15.133 --> 22:18.068
before she died
in childbirth.

22:18.102 --> 22:21.439
Molly herself, well,

22:21.471 --> 22:24.408
she was one of Harlan Pritz's,
working ladies.

22:24.442 --> 22:26.611
She was one of his whores.
Just say it, ambrose.

22:26.644 --> 22:28.680
That's enough of that, Caleb.

22:28.712 --> 22:30.749
Harlan Pritz?

22:30.781 --> 22:33.717
The owner
of the dogwood saloon.

22:33.750 --> 22:37.020
There's a half dozen men
could have been Danny's father.

22:37.054 --> 22:41.025
A dozen more
she never knew the names of.

22:41.057 --> 22:43.494
Look, I believe
the Marshall understands.

22:43.528 --> 22:45.663
Danny holt isn't saying
what's happened,

22:45.695 --> 22:47.097
and that's the long
and short of it.

22:47.131 --> 22:49.734
Well, let me ask you this,
sheriff,

22:49.767 --> 22:51.702
where were you
when the killing took place?

22:51.736 --> 22:53.838
Well...

22:53.871 --> 22:57.175
I was, across the road
from the hotel making my rounds

22:57.208 --> 22:59.611
when I... I saw ambrose here.

22:59.644 --> 23:02.646
Mayor Taylor...

23:02.680 --> 23:04.883
At your service.

23:04.915 --> 23:06.884
As I was saying,

23:06.917 --> 23:10.454
I was making my rounds
when I saw mayor Taylor

23:10.488 --> 23:12.023
sitting out in front
of the mercantile,

23:12.056 --> 23:14.692
so I just stopped to pass
a few words with him.

23:14.724 --> 23:16.593
You heard the shots?

23:16.626 --> 23:19.730
No, come to think of it...

23:19.763 --> 23:23.801
Mr. Mannors ran out from the door
of his hotel to us and shouted.

23:23.835 --> 23:26.671
And,
we rushed over there.

23:26.703 --> 23:29.673
-You and the mayor?
-That's right.

23:29.707 --> 23:31.776
And you were in,
Mrs. Tammery's room

23:31.808 --> 23:36.047
within moments
and nobody could come or go

23:36.079 --> 23:37.182
without you
seeing them first.

23:37.214 --> 23:39.650
Right again.

23:39.683 --> 23:42.586
And, well, you sent
for the doctor, of course.

23:42.619 --> 23:46.690
Well, yeah, we sent Pete, the owner of
the mercantile, to fetch doctor moss.

23:46.723 --> 23:50.861
Yes, doctor moss
at your service.

23:50.894 --> 23:53.798
So, doctor,
Pete found you in your office

23:53.830 --> 23:56.233
and brought you back
to the hotel?

23:56.267 --> 23:58.001
Yes.

23:58.035 --> 24:00.471
We found the good doctor
at the barrell top saloon,

24:00.505 --> 24:02.106
in the middle of the day,
I might add.

24:02.138 --> 24:03.774
For the love of...

24:03.807 --> 24:05.009
Just stating the facts.

24:05.041 --> 24:07.978
In any case, doctor moss,

24:08.011 --> 24:09.913
you were on the scene
in short order

24:09.946 --> 24:11.715
and examined the deceased.

24:11.749 --> 24:16.187
I was, and I did,
and he was dead. Dead as hell.

24:16.220 --> 24:19.824
-With two bullet wounds?
-To the chest.

24:19.856 --> 24:23.661
-From a. 45 Colt?
-What?

24:23.693 --> 24:26.964
The bullet wounds, they were from
that particular model of Colt pistol?

24:26.998 --> 24:29.000
Well, yes, I assume.

24:29.032 --> 24:32.769
Danny holt was standing there
with a pistol in his hand.

24:32.803 --> 24:35.273
Which was missing two rounds.
I checked.

24:35.306 --> 24:39.177
So, what you're saying is,

24:39.210 --> 24:41.613
you didn't see the need
to examine the bullet wounds,

24:41.645 --> 24:44.648
what with the boy standing there
with a fired weapon and all?

24:44.682 --> 24:48.685
Well,
it seemed pretty obvious.

24:48.719 --> 24:51.722
It does, doesn't it?

24:51.756 --> 24:54.659
I don't suppose you examined
the slugs either?

24:54.692 --> 24:57.194
I mean, isn't that what
you'd normally do, though?

24:57.228 --> 25:00.163
Examine the...
What the hell for?

25:00.196 --> 25:02.132
I mean, good god, man.

25:02.165 --> 25:05.035
Yes, I would normally
examine those slugs,

25:05.068 --> 25:08.906
but in this case, we had
a eyewitness to the shooting,

25:08.940 --> 25:12.744
a dead guy on the ground with
two bullet wounds in his chest,

25:12.777 --> 25:17.615
and Danny holt standing there with a
pistol that had been fired twice,

25:17.647 --> 25:19.783
meaning it was
pretty obvious.

25:19.817 --> 25:22.185
I mean, normal procedure
be damned.

25:22.219 --> 25:25.856
To examine those slugs would
have been a waste of my time

25:25.890 --> 25:27.826
and taxpayer money.

25:33.163 --> 25:37.335
All right, very good, very good.
I'll ju... I'll...

25:37.367 --> 25:39.604
The body's at Roman's.
Give me 15 minutes

25:39.636 --> 25:41.038
and you'll have
your damn slugs.

25:41.071 --> 25:44.274
-Roman's?
-Roman Pearl, the undertaker.

25:44.307 --> 25:46.844
There's a great immediacy
to this, Caleb.

25:46.876 --> 25:49.246
Don't stop at the saloon
along the way.

25:49.279 --> 25:52.584
You don't need any more
to drink today.

25:52.616 --> 25:57.020
And lord knows, you could use some
time away from them gaming tables.

25:57.054 --> 25:59.891
I heard how your luck's
been running lately.

25:59.923 --> 26:02.626
Mayor, why don't you
accompany the good doctor

26:02.660 --> 26:04.028
just to make sure everything's
done all proper like?

26:04.060 --> 26:07.097
No, I want to do this myself,
damn you all.

26:07.131 --> 26:09.200
Come on, Caleb.

26:09.232 --> 26:12.636
You had me and the sheriff witness
your postmortem examinations before.

26:12.670 --> 26:15.173
-I'd rather you didn't.
-Let's just go.

26:15.205 --> 26:17.207
The sooner we end
this nonsense,

26:17.240 --> 26:19.943
the sooner we get the whole
matter behind us.

26:19.977 --> 26:22.280
Do resolve this matter
quickly, doctor.

26:22.313 --> 26:26.217
We wouldn't want any
unnecessary investigations

26:26.250 --> 26:28.653
holding things up,
now would we?

26:36.160 --> 26:39.096
So what do you think of
this here, Marshall white?

26:39.130 --> 26:41.899
He's becoming a damn
nuisance, if you ask me.

26:41.932 --> 26:44.635
This whole examination
is pointless.

26:44.669 --> 26:46.638
Danny holt shot that man

26:46.671 --> 26:48.740
and with that Colt .45
of his.

26:48.772 --> 26:51.808
I agree with you,
I certainly do.

26:51.842 --> 26:53.711
But I suppose
this can't hurt.

26:53.743 --> 26:55.679
Just as an assurance,
you understand?

26:55.712 --> 26:57.615
For the courts, you know.

27:05.990 --> 27:10.428
Gentlemen,
what can I do for you?

27:10.461 --> 27:13.163
I was about to close down
services for the evening.

27:13.196 --> 27:17.167
Well, Roman, we're here about
the unfortunate Mr. Tammery.

27:17.201 --> 27:20.270
By unfortunate,
you mean deceased?

27:20.304 --> 27:23.307
He means the dead guy
on this pine door here.

27:23.339 --> 27:24.675
What about him?

27:24.709 --> 27:26.678
Well, as unlikely
as it seems,

27:26.711 --> 27:29.079
Caleb here has to take
a look at the deceased.

27:35.452 --> 27:38.722
Really? To what ends?

27:38.756 --> 27:41.125
I promise you,
your healing powers,

27:41.157 --> 27:43.461
however formidable
you may hold them,

27:43.493 --> 27:47.230
will do Mr. Tammery
no good tonight.

27:47.263 --> 27:51.068
Just let me look
at the damn body, Roman.

27:51.102 --> 27:54.405
He's all yours.
He's not going anywhere tonight.

27:54.438 --> 27:57.975
I see you don't have him
boxed up yet.

27:58.008 --> 28:00.344
I'm saving that boxing up
for in the morning.

28:00.376 --> 28:05.916
He's being shipped back
to rawlins, I suppose?

28:05.950 --> 28:07.919
That is the plan.

28:07.951 --> 28:09.487
And how's the lovely widow?

28:09.519 --> 28:13.156
Grievous in her mourning,
I suppose?

28:13.190 --> 28:16.394
Um, well, I suppose.

28:16.426 --> 28:19.062
She is a striking lady.

28:19.096 --> 28:23.768
I should visit her at the hotel
and express my condolences.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.002
Well, she's not in the hotel
just now...

28:26.036 --> 28:28.773
May I use your instruments,
Roman?

28:28.806 --> 28:30.709
Of course.

28:34.244 --> 28:36.346
Whatever is he up to?

28:36.380 --> 28:41.185
Well, we need the slugs out of the
body for evidence against Danny holt.

28:41.218 --> 28:44.522
I assumed his guilt
had already been established.

28:44.555 --> 28:47.458
Well, not to the satisfaction
of the U.S. Marshall

28:47.490 --> 28:50.961
that's come to remand him
to the court in laramie.

28:50.994 --> 28:54.865
You should find whatever you
want to work with there, Caleb.

28:56.299 --> 28:59.936
I doubt if your patient
will have any complaint

28:59.970 --> 29:03.341
over precision or technique.

29:03.374 --> 29:05.143
Are you two gonna get out
of my way

29:05.175 --> 29:07.010
or are you planning to dig
around in his chest yourselves?

29:09.078 --> 29:10.981
Well, get in there.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.989
While we're here, ambrose,

29:18.021 --> 29:21.893
I wonder if we might
discuss finances.

29:21.925 --> 29:24.461
Finances?
Whose finances?

29:24.494 --> 29:26.830
Mine, specifically.

29:26.864 --> 29:29.033
Well, what about yours,
specifically?

29:29.066 --> 29:32.502
The town normally pays me
for my services.

29:32.536 --> 29:35.139
Well, if there's
no next of kin,

29:35.172 --> 29:37.341
I naturally assume
that Camille Tammery

29:37.374 --> 29:39.177
had made arrangements
for her husband.

29:39.210 --> 29:42.279
Naturally, and in this case,
you are correct.

29:42.313 --> 29:44.148
Mrs. Tammery has provided

29:44.181 --> 29:48.318
for the arrangements
for her husband.

29:48.352 --> 29:50.354
Quite stingily,
I might add.

29:50.386 --> 29:52.490
Well then, what?

29:52.522 --> 29:57.828
Well, there's the teamster who
tumbled from the wagon a week ago.

29:57.862 --> 30:03.835
The young man found dead behind the
dogwood saloon two weeks prior.

30:03.867 --> 30:07.304
I provided services
for both.

30:07.337 --> 30:09.406
Well, the bare minimum...

30:09.440 --> 30:13.978
The bare minimum is all
that the town provides,

30:14.010 --> 30:16.314
and I have yet to be paid.

30:16.346 --> 30:19.517
Well, yes,
there are some circumstances

30:19.549 --> 30:21.551
that, may defer payment,

30:21.585 --> 30:24.055
just for a short time,
you understand.

30:24.087 --> 30:28.192
Is there a shortage
in the tax coffers, ambrose?

30:28.224 --> 30:30.528
Well, not a shortage exactly.

30:30.560 --> 30:34.064
It's, simply,
money is tight, you know?

30:34.097 --> 30:37.634
Should I approach
the town treasurer?

30:37.667 --> 30:39.936
That's exactly
what I would do.

30:39.970 --> 30:41.972
That's a great idea.
Take it up with him, and...

30:42.006 --> 30:44.976
-Ambrose?
-Yes?

30:45.009 --> 30:49.980
Aren't you the acting town
treasurer until one is appointed?

30:50.013 --> 30:52.549
Yes, well, I'll look into it.
Damn it, Caleb!

30:52.583 --> 30:55.420
How long does it take to remove
two slugs out of a dead man?

30:59.222 --> 31:00.957
Well, I'll be damned.

31:00.990 --> 31:03.126
Those aren't from
a Colt .45 pistol.

31:03.160 --> 31:04.961
Should they be?

31:04.994 --> 31:06.596
Well, that's what Danny holt
was holding.

31:06.630 --> 31:10.534
I'd say there's a problem.

31:10.567 --> 31:13.904
My, but it has grown
stuffy in here.

31:13.938 --> 31:16.173
Henry,
I should like some air.

31:16.205 --> 31:18.275
Of course.

31:18.308 --> 31:20.176
Just a minute, please.

31:20.210 --> 31:23.447
I prefer we all stay put
until the doctor returns.

31:23.480 --> 31:28.085
Well, I should think that I would be
allowed to come and go as I please.

31:28.117 --> 31:31.154
Some special consideration should
be given, don't you think?

31:31.188 --> 31:34.525
You do remember that I am
a grieving widow?

31:34.557 --> 31:37.994
Well, a widow anyway.

31:38.028 --> 31:40.197
Now just what in the hell
do you mean by that?

31:40.230 --> 31:42.400
Easy now, Henry.

31:42.432 --> 31:45.603
See? Here's what's been
eating at you, sheriff.

31:45.635 --> 31:49.472
The fact that nobody can
remember hearing them shots.

31:49.506 --> 31:53.210
If that .45 caliber had been
fired up in Mrs. Tammery's room,

31:53.242 --> 31:55.980
twice in fact,

31:56.012 --> 32:00.050
well, you and the mayor probably would
have heard it across the street.

32:00.084 --> 32:03.520
And Mr. Mannors here, well, he certainly
would have heard it down in the lobby.

32:03.554 --> 32:07.024
Well, by god.

32:07.057 --> 32:10.594
Yeah, see,
your instincts were good.

32:10.626 --> 32:12.696
Your guts are just bothering you
about the detail,

32:12.730 --> 32:15.466
but you couldn't put
your finger on why.

32:15.499 --> 32:17.567
So what are you saying?

32:17.601 --> 32:22.974
What he's saying, Henry, is that a
different gun killed George Tammery.

32:23.007 --> 32:25.009
That's why we need to see
those slugs.

32:25.041 --> 32:26.676
That is correct.

32:26.710 --> 32:29.212
But Danny holt's gun
had been fired twice,

32:29.246 --> 32:31.148
and we have
Camille's testimony.

32:31.181 --> 32:34.151
Well, that gun's important
for another reason.

32:34.183 --> 32:37.488
If Danny had shot Mr. Tammery

32:37.520 --> 32:39.490
because the man
was advancing on him,

32:39.522 --> 32:42.659
a single slug
from that Colt .45

32:42.692 --> 32:45.596
in the chest from a foot away
would have sufficed.

32:45.628 --> 32:48.565
It'd have thrown Tammery
back across the room

32:48.598 --> 32:51.067
and put him down quick.

32:51.101 --> 32:52.403
So why the second shot?

32:52.435 --> 32:54.437
Well, yeah.

32:54.471 --> 32:59.609
I mean, one shot from a gun like
that would have been self defense.

32:59.643 --> 33:01.245
Yeah, but two shots
from that gun?

33:01.278 --> 33:03.713
Well, that's just
plain murder.

33:03.747 --> 33:09.019
So, what does all this mean?

33:09.053 --> 33:11.255
I am sure that
I do not understand

33:11.288 --> 33:14.192
anything this Marshall says.

33:19.395 --> 33:21.565
You're a beautiful woman,
and that's a fact.

33:21.597 --> 33:24.335
She ain't pretty enough
to hang for, boy.

33:27.237 --> 33:29.673
Tell me, Danny,

33:29.705 --> 33:32.609
how'd you come to fire them
two shots from your pistol?

33:34.711 --> 33:38.649
You own your hotel outright,
Mr. Mannors?

33:38.682 --> 33:40.683
I do.

33:40.717 --> 33:43.086
I assume Mrs. Tammery
knows that.

33:43.119 --> 33:45.355
Now, Marshall,

33:45.388 --> 33:48.058
I certainly understand what you're
saying about the gun and all,

33:48.092 --> 33:50.127
no questions there,

33:50.160 --> 33:52.196
but you're losing me again.

33:52.229 --> 33:54.597
Exactly what is it
you're implying now?

33:54.631 --> 33:57.168
Yeah, help us out here,
Marshall.

33:57.201 --> 34:00.336
It seems to me from what I've seen in
the short time that I've been here,

34:00.369 --> 34:04.207
that, Mr. Mannors
and Mrs. Tammery

34:04.240 --> 34:07.344
have become, quite
familiar with one another.

34:07.376 --> 34:10.480
What with him taking her hand and
calling her Camille and all.

34:10.514 --> 34:14.452
Hell, he's become
downright protective even.

34:14.485 --> 34:16.753
Well, yes,
we have become close.

34:16.786 --> 34:20.322
-What of it?
-Become close how fast?

34:20.356 --> 34:23.626
Just how long have you been
here in town, Mrs. Tammery?

34:23.659 --> 34:26.163
Well, just a little
over a week.

34:26.195 --> 34:28.297
Is this important somehow?

34:28.331 --> 34:30.567
Maybe. Maybe.

34:30.601 --> 34:34.304
Seems awful short time for you two
to become sweet on one another.

34:34.338 --> 34:37.475
My.

34:37.507 --> 34:41.744
I do love the way you express
yourself, Marshall white.

34:41.777 --> 34:44.813
It makes you seem so...

34:44.847 --> 34:46.650
Simple.

34:46.681 --> 34:50.820
You know, now that
I think of it, maybe...

34:50.853 --> 34:54.791
Maybe a week's not too short a
time for cupid's arrow to strike,

34:54.824 --> 35:00.330
not when one party's intentionally
trying to make that happen.

35:00.364 --> 35:02.398
Your point, sir?

35:02.431 --> 35:06.603
My point, Mr. Mannors, is that I did
not just happen to be in rawlins

35:06.637 --> 35:09.440
when I got the telegram
telling me to come here

35:09.472 --> 35:12.175
to look into a lady's husband
being murdered.

35:12.208 --> 35:16.847
In fact, I was on the trail of a young
woman by the name of Lucy silver.

35:19.315 --> 35:21.918
-Who?
-Lucy silver.

35:21.952 --> 35:25.823
She's an ex-saloon girl who's made
a short but colorful career of,

35:25.856 --> 35:28.759
marrying or sometimes
just romancing

35:28.791 --> 35:30.693
men of financial substance

35:30.726 --> 35:33.463
and absconding
with their money.

35:33.496 --> 35:36.799
Now, generally speaking,
she just leaves 'em.

35:36.833 --> 35:38.402
But occasionally,

35:38.434 --> 35:41.739
-she leaves 'em dead.
-The hell you say.

35:41.771 --> 35:44.174
Even before she left the saloon,
she was no one to be crossed.

35:45.943 --> 35:49.547
She once shot a fella during
an argument in medicine bow

35:49.579 --> 35:52.549
in a saloon
she was working in then.

35:52.583 --> 35:54.351
Shot him right in the leg,

35:54.384 --> 35:56.619
right in front
of the medicine bow mayor.

35:56.652 --> 36:00.256
-Lucy, don't.
-Don't what?

36:01.925 --> 36:04.260
Damn it, Lucy.

36:04.293 --> 36:07.263
But she does sound
like a handful.

36:07.297 --> 36:09.432
She is.

36:09.465 --> 36:12.735
One man has already met his maker
under suspicious circumstances,

36:12.768 --> 36:15.505
and at least three more
have been robbed blind.

36:15.539 --> 36:18.842
So when I heard that a woman
meeting her general description

36:18.875 --> 36:22.213
had fleeced a fella in rawlins
and let out for parts unknown,

36:22.246 --> 36:24.847
well, I hurried there
right quick.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.750
But by the time I got there,
well,

36:27.784 --> 36:29.552
the fella had already
left town

36:29.585 --> 36:31.654
in pursuit
of the aforementioned lady.

36:31.688 --> 36:34.458
-And you missed 'em both.
-Yeah, yeah.

36:34.490 --> 36:36.693
But then, by god,

36:36.726 --> 36:38.862
I got a wire from laramie
telling me a stranger

36:38.894 --> 36:41.565
had been killed
right here in dogwood pass

36:41.597 --> 36:44.768
in his estranged wife's
hotel room.

36:44.800 --> 36:48.806
Marshall, what was the name
of that fella from rawlins,

36:48.838 --> 36:50.507
the one that got fleeced?

36:50.539 --> 36:54.711
I think you already figured
that out, sheriff Ramey.

36:57.014 --> 36:58.916
George Tammery.

37:01.550 --> 37:03.953
George Tammery did not
come here

37:03.987 --> 37:06.923
to reconcile with you, Lucy.

37:06.956 --> 37:09.893
He came here to get
his money back.

37:09.925 --> 37:13.529
Things got rough.
You killed him.

37:13.563 --> 37:16.834
And you'd already started
working on Mr. Mannors here

37:16.867 --> 37:18.769
for his money and property.

37:18.802 --> 37:21.005
Nonsense.

37:21.038 --> 37:23.840
Yes, I left George
in rawlins.

37:23.873 --> 37:26.309
I had already
admitted that.

37:26.342 --> 37:29.045
And of course I took
a little money with me.

37:29.079 --> 37:33.417
Now, I wouldn't run out
into the wild

37:33.449 --> 37:36.386
with nothing but the clothes
on my back and an old buggy,

37:36.420 --> 37:37.921
now would I?

37:37.954 --> 37:41.825
And as for this
"Lucy silver,"

37:41.858 --> 37:43.727
I have never heard of her.

37:43.760 --> 37:46.530
Well, let me educate you
on her.

37:46.563 --> 37:48.499
She's about your height
and weight,

37:48.532 --> 37:51.835
got your same beautiful
auburn hair,

37:51.867 --> 37:53.536
and she's smart enough
and pretty enough

37:53.570 --> 37:56.774
to win men over
in short order.

37:56.806 --> 37:59.475
And since leaving the saloons
and going out

37:59.509 --> 38:01.445
on her love 'em
and leave 'em games,

38:01.478 --> 38:03.047
she's been accused
of killing one man

38:03.079 --> 38:07.918
with a Pearl-handled
silver-plated .32 derringer.

38:07.951 --> 38:10.653
She's carried it in a box
since her saloon days.

38:10.686 --> 38:12.322
They say she never goes
anywhere without it,

38:12.356 --> 38:15.659
hence the moniker
"Lucy silver."

38:15.692 --> 38:19.329
Now that is a charming story,
Marshall white.

38:19.362 --> 38:21.731
Almost as charming

38:21.764 --> 38:24.567
as worrying a poor,
defenseless young widow

38:24.601 --> 38:27.371
who only just lost
her husband.

38:27.403 --> 38:32.076
My, but the Marshall service
must be proud of you.

38:32.108 --> 38:35.645
I think I'll be going
to my hotel room now, sheriff.

38:35.679 --> 38:38.115
Henry, I left my buggy
out front.

38:38.148 --> 38:41.885
Would you be a dear
and put it in the livery for me?

38:41.918 --> 38:45.356
Of course, Camille.

38:45.389 --> 38:48.925
Good god, look what
we have here, Marshall.

38:48.958 --> 38:50.360
Show him, Caleb.

38:50.393 --> 38:52.629
Here's your damn slugs,
Marshall.

38:55.532 --> 38:59.036
-Damn sure not a .45 slug.
-Damn sure not.

38:59.068 --> 39:01.137
It's more like .32 caliber
I'd say, wouldn't you?

39:01.170 --> 39:03.639
Well, what does it all mean?

39:03.672 --> 39:06.743
Well, the Marshall here,
he believes our Camille Tammery

39:06.777 --> 39:09.112
is actually an ex-saloon girl
named Lucy silver

39:09.146 --> 39:11.749
who's been getting men
to fall in love with her

39:11.782 --> 39:13.884
and taking off
with their money.

39:13.916 --> 39:16.519
She's also been known to carry
a silver-plated derringer,

39:16.552 --> 39:18.087
one she's used more than once.

39:18.121 --> 39:21.724
I'll be damned.
Did you hear that, Caleb?

39:21.757 --> 39:23.393
Yeah, yeah.

39:23.427 --> 39:25.496
Ma'am, I'm gonna
have to ask you

39:25.528 --> 39:27.063
to reach in your bodice
and if anything's there,

39:27.097 --> 39:31.135
-please produce it.
-I will do no such thing.

39:31.168 --> 39:35.139
And you certainly will not
go in there yourself, sheriff.

39:35.172 --> 39:38.007
No. No, I won't.

39:38.041 --> 39:39.410
But doc moss will.

39:44.681 --> 39:46.048
It's all right, ma'am.

39:46.081 --> 39:47.984
I'm a physician.

39:53.556 --> 39:56.058
Well, I'll be.

39:56.092 --> 39:59.762
Sheriff, I'm ready to talk.

39:59.795 --> 40:03.866
Finally got something to say,
Danny?

40:03.900 --> 40:07.171
She told part of the truth.

40:07.204 --> 40:10.507
He did push his way in, and he
was talking awful mean to her.

40:10.539 --> 40:13.943
-George Tammery?
-Yes, sir.

40:13.976 --> 40:17.213
Did he strike her
or shove her to the floor?

40:17.246 --> 40:20.483
No, I guess not.
He was just talking mean.

40:20.516 --> 40:23.152
He didn't want her back, did he?
He just wanted his money.

40:23.186 --> 40:28.826
-That's what he said.
-And then what happened?

40:28.858 --> 40:30.960
He yelled.

40:30.994 --> 40:33.564
She pulled her piece.

40:33.597 --> 40:35.599
She shot him.

40:51.780 --> 40:56.186
Why didn't you tell me?

40:56.219 --> 41:00.224
She'd been talking to me a lot
since she came to dogwood,

41:00.257 --> 41:04.094
saying she liked me a lot more
than she did Mr. Mannors there.

41:04.126 --> 41:06.864
She said she'd have his money as soon
as she could get her hands on it

41:06.896 --> 41:11.034
and that her and me
would go away together.

41:11.067 --> 41:15.072
Well, I guess I can see
how you'd fall for it.

41:15.105 --> 41:18.208
I did.

41:18.240 --> 41:20.576
I guess I love her.

41:20.610 --> 41:22.546
So when Tammery came after her
and she'd killed him,

41:22.579 --> 41:24.914
she convinced you
to take the blame.

41:24.947 --> 41:29.585
Told you to trust her and keep your
mouth shut, something like that?

41:29.619 --> 41:31.288
Yes, sir.
Just like that.

41:31.320 --> 41:35.025
She said her plan would make it
sound like I had to shoot him

41:35.057 --> 41:37.693
to protect both of us.

41:37.726 --> 41:39.161
She said even if I did
go to jail,

41:39.195 --> 41:40.797
it wouldn't be for long.

41:40.829 --> 41:43.132
And she'd wait for me
as long as it took.

41:43.166 --> 41:45.168
And I suppose she quickly
told you this

41:45.201 --> 41:48.938
while Mr. Mannors ran out
of the hotel room for help.

41:48.972 --> 41:51.975
Yes, sir.

41:52.007 --> 41:55.846
And you believed her?

41:55.878 --> 41:59.849
Still do believe she meant it,
even just a little bit.

41:59.882 --> 42:02.552
Well, don't you believe it.

42:02.585 --> 42:05.655
She's smart, and she's fooled
older and wiser men than you.

42:05.688 --> 42:09.125
She wanted us to believe
you did it with your gun.

42:09.159 --> 42:11.929
That way her fancy little
derringer wouldn't enter into it,

42:11.961 --> 42:14.664
nor the possibility
that she did it herself.

42:14.697 --> 42:19.201
Pretty much
the way you figured it.

42:19.235 --> 42:21.271
Just one thing
I can't figure, though.

42:21.304 --> 42:23.941
What's that?

42:23.974 --> 42:27.077
Well, Danny's gun
had been fired twice.

42:27.110 --> 42:31.882
Why and how,
without being heard?

42:31.914 --> 42:35.217
Well, we were out
for a buggy ride.

42:35.251 --> 42:37.019
She asked to shoot my Colt,

42:37.052 --> 42:39.056
saying that she never
shot one before

42:39.088 --> 42:41.891
and wanted to see
what it was like.

42:41.925 --> 42:45.128
And you figured you'd just
reload it later.

42:45.161 --> 42:47.197
You know George Tammery's
on his way into town

42:47.230 --> 42:50.666
when you shot that pistol,
Lucy?

42:50.699 --> 42:54.971
Hell no.
That was just good luck.

42:55.005 --> 42:59.610
Marshall, I'm about to
let Danny out of that cage.

42:59.643 --> 43:02.278
Should I put her in it or do you want
to take her to laramie right now?

43:02.311 --> 43:07.351
-Well, I gu...
-I...!

43:10.052 --> 43:14.156
Get your goddamn hands off me,
you lecherous bastard!

43:14.190 --> 43:17.094
We're going to take a little
buggy ride, you and me.

43:17.126 --> 43:21.030
If you're real good and these boys
here don't do anything stupid,

43:21.063 --> 43:24.033
you might just live
through the night.

43:24.067 --> 43:27.637
Marshall white,
you knew so damn much

43:27.670 --> 43:30.873
all about me and my pretty
silver little toy.

43:30.907 --> 43:33.910
Too bad nobody told you
about the pistol I keep

43:33.943 --> 43:36.079
strapped to my leg
under my skirts.

43:36.112 --> 43:38.882
It sure is.
That a new practice, Lucy?

43:38.914 --> 43:40.817
New enough it seems.

43:44.753 --> 43:46.923
Don't forget
you owe me money, Caleb.

43:49.425 --> 43:50.760
Go.

43:52.394 --> 43:54.297
Hurry it up.

44:00.335 --> 44:02.838
Take the reins, old man.

44:02.871 --> 44:05.708
You're gonna drive and I'll
keep this pistol in your ribs.

44:05.742 --> 44:08.311
Don't you men even think
about following us.

44:08.344 --> 44:11.148
If I see you behind us,
I'll kill him.

44:11.181 --> 44:13.449
I believe you, Lucy.

44:13.483 --> 44:15.751
You can't let her get away. She'll
kill him as soon as she's clear.

44:15.784 --> 44:18.755
What the hell?

44:20.322 --> 44:22.324
You pulled the king bolts
out of the buggy.

44:22.358 --> 44:23.260
Yep.

44:32.202 --> 44:34.337
Did you rig my buggy,
Marshall white?

44:34.369 --> 44:37.074
-Yes I did, Lucy.
-God, I hate you.

44:37.106 --> 44:38.942
I imagine so.

44:38.974 --> 44:41.711
So, you could only have
done it

44:41.744 --> 44:44.714
before you went into
Ramey's office.

44:44.748 --> 44:47.250
Right again.

44:47.282 --> 44:49.385
So you knew all along?

44:49.418 --> 44:53.089
Well, I suspected, but I figured
I'd better play it safe.

44:53.123 --> 44:57.027
So why let all of that
go on in the office?

44:57.059 --> 44:59.462
Why not just call me out
right away?

44:59.496 --> 45:04.267
Well, like I said, I only suspected
that you were Lucy silver.

45:04.300 --> 45:07.070
And if it turned out
to be the case, which it did,

45:07.103 --> 45:09.306
I couldn't be sure
that you did the shooting.

45:09.338 --> 45:11.907
I had to let things
play out.

45:11.940 --> 45:13.876
As it turned out, it was you

45:13.909 --> 45:16.413
and with another fella's money
on the run again.

45:16.445 --> 45:19.915
And a damn fine buggy.

45:19.949 --> 45:24.421
And a damn fine buggy, which I'm gonna
have to ask you to step down out of now.

45:32.228 --> 45:36.032
My! Marshall white!

45:36.065 --> 45:39.336
Are you trying to see how far
I'll go to negotiate my freedom?

45:39.369 --> 45:41.037
Pardon me, Lucy,
my hand slipped.

45:41.070 --> 45:43.039
Sure it did,
Marshall white.

45:43.072 --> 45:45.075
Or should I call you Moses,

45:45.108 --> 45:48.278
now that we're becoming
somewhat intimate?

45:48.311 --> 45:51.815
You know, Lucy, they told me you had a sense
of humor. I guess they weren't lying.

45:51.847 --> 45:54.217
I'm just a laugh
a minute, Moses.

45:54.250 --> 45:56.318
You should keep me around
and find out.

45:56.351 --> 45:58.387
You all right, doc moss?
You ain't hurt, are you?

45:58.420 --> 46:00.923
No, I'm not hurt.
I'm startled, certainly.

46:00.956 --> 46:02.424
Damn woman scared the wits
out of me.

46:02.458 --> 46:05.262
-Not hurt, though?
-No. No, thank god.

46:05.295 --> 46:06.863
Good. Sheriff,

46:06.896 --> 46:11.134
I suggest you lock up Lucy here
and the good doctor.

46:11.166 --> 46:12.902
Did you say lock up doc moss?

46:12.936 --> 46:15.338
What the hell are you
talking about now, Marshall?

46:15.371 --> 46:18.041
Well, it bothered me a little
when Lucy hiked up her skirts

46:18.074 --> 46:19.543
and produced that weapon
without any of us seeing it,

46:19.576 --> 46:21.278
like it just appeared
in her hand.

46:21.311 --> 46:23.146
So just now when I was
helping her out of the wagon,

46:23.179 --> 46:25.014
I made sure to get
a real good feel of her leg.

46:25.047 --> 46:26.549
Yes, you did, Marshall white.

46:26.583 --> 46:28.485
Maybe you ought to be
arrested for that.

46:28.518 --> 46:32.289
And I found that she is not
wearing a holster on her leg.

46:32.322 --> 46:34.356
She lied to us about that.

46:34.389 --> 46:36.225
Well, then where'd she get
the pistol?

46:36.259 --> 46:39.061
She probably pulled it off
of doc moss here

46:39.094 --> 46:40.396
when she fainted
into his arms,

46:40.429 --> 46:43.032
which was planned
for our benefit.

46:43.065 --> 46:45.501
She probably pulled it out
from underneath his vest.

46:45.534 --> 46:47.536
Henry Mannors could have
given her that gun.

46:47.570 --> 46:50.407
I mean, he was beside her
the entire time.

46:50.440 --> 46:52.242
And he is, after all,
her lover.

46:52.275 --> 46:54.376
I did no such thing!

46:54.409 --> 46:56.478
Well, somebody gave her
that gun.

46:56.512 --> 46:59.082
My gun, to be exact.

46:59.114 --> 47:00.983
Roman?

47:01.016 --> 47:03.185
That's right, ambrose.

47:03.219 --> 47:05.889
After you and Caleb
left my office,

47:05.922 --> 47:10.527
I noticed my pistol was missing
from my desk drawer.

47:10.559 --> 47:15.465
So you see, Marshall, either
mayor Taylor or doctor moss

47:15.498 --> 47:18.134
could have passed her
that gun.

47:18.166 --> 47:21.170
Well, that's a damn lie,
and a crazy one at that.

47:21.204 --> 47:24.441
Why, Henry Mannors had more reason
to help her than any of us,

47:24.474 --> 47:27.344
being he's in love with her.

47:27.376 --> 47:31.313
I certainly would,
if I was he.

47:31.347 --> 47:33.283
Just look at her.

47:33.315 --> 47:35.951
My god.
Not you, too.

47:35.985 --> 47:38.320
-She's so lovely.
-Alive?

47:38.353 --> 47:41.457
You probably don't see
much of that.

47:41.490 --> 47:44.193
Marshall, why do you say
doc moss passed her that gun?

47:44.226 --> 47:46.328
-I mean, why would he do it?
-Money, sheriff.

47:46.362 --> 47:49.599
Money to pay off them gambling
debts I heard y'all mention.

47:49.632 --> 47:52.168
The same reason he didn't want
to produce those two bullets

47:52.201 --> 47:55.005
that killed George Tammery
after he'd been asked.

47:55.038 --> 47:58.942
He wanted us to believe that Danny
had done the shooting with his gun.

47:58.974 --> 48:01.210
See, if we all believed
that he killed her husband,

48:01.244 --> 48:03.380
well, then Lucy would appear
to be a grieving widow

48:03.413 --> 48:06.916
who stood to acquire all
of George Tammery's holdings.

48:06.949 --> 48:10.519
And not just the money she took
when she left town,

48:10.552 --> 48:12.554
but all his property
and business,

48:12.588 --> 48:14.423
and she could afford
to pay the doc

48:14.456 --> 48:16.992
a pretty penny
to keep her in the clear.

48:17.025 --> 48:21.463
Mayor Taylor needs money
just as much as doctor moss.

48:21.496 --> 48:26.001
To replace the funds he skimmed
from the town's tax coffer.

48:26.034 --> 48:28.337
That's a lie!

48:28.371 --> 48:30.706
Then where's the money
gone to, ambrose,

48:30.739 --> 48:33.309
if not into your pockets?

48:41.483 --> 48:43.652
Stop it, men!

48:43.686 --> 48:47.157
I said stop it,
before you hurt each other!

48:47.190 --> 48:49.291
Not much chance of that,
sheriff.

48:49.324 --> 48:53.429
I've seen better catfights
between tired old whores.

48:53.463 --> 48:55.699
Councilman, all of you, you've
let this woman's influence

48:55.731 --> 48:57.567
reduce you to fighting
in the street.

48:57.599 --> 49:00.436
You can't blame me
for all of this.

49:00.469 --> 49:02.638
It seems as though your town
has had its share

49:02.672 --> 49:05.108
of dirty little
secrets before,

49:05.141 --> 49:07.543
starting with these
little councilmen of yours.

49:07.577 --> 49:09.145
Marshall, I understand
your reasoning,

49:09.177 --> 49:11.013
but when would Lucy silver
and doctor moss

49:11.047 --> 49:13.315
-have arranged such a deal?
-Think about it.

49:13.349 --> 49:17.586
There must have been some time
when they were alone.

49:17.619 --> 49:20.522
Yeah, after the shooting.

49:20.556 --> 49:23.193
I was questioning Danny
and looking through her room

49:23.226 --> 49:26.429
and doctor moss went in the
other room to examine her

49:26.461 --> 49:28.630
'cause George Tammery
had roughed her up,

49:28.664 --> 49:31.701
and she had swooned,
after all.

49:31.733 --> 49:33.737
Yes. Yes, she did.

49:33.769 --> 49:36.538
Just like she did
in your office this evening.

49:36.572 --> 49:39.642
Of course, the doctor didn't
find any injuries,

49:39.675 --> 49:43.113
but it did give her an opportunity
to make an offer of money.

49:43.146 --> 49:45.749
So why'd she lie about the gun
being holstered to her leg?

49:45.782 --> 49:47.550
To protect doctor moss?

49:47.583 --> 49:51.387
Well, she had to have us believe
that he was her hostage

49:51.420 --> 49:55.257
so that we wouldn't try
and stop her escape.

49:55.291 --> 49:58.061
Other than that,
she don't give a damn about him.

49:58.094 --> 50:01.331
Damn right about that.

50:01.364 --> 50:03.166
Did doctor moss know
you had that pistol

50:03.199 --> 50:04.467
in your drawer, Mr. Pearl?

50:04.500 --> 50:06.235
Yes, he did.

50:06.268 --> 50:09.505
I showed it to him the other day
in hopes of him buying it.

50:09.539 --> 50:11.708
I'm that short of cash.

50:11.740 --> 50:14.443
The doctor couldn't afford to pay
you for that pistol, could he?

50:14.476 --> 50:16.245
No, he could not.

50:16.278 --> 50:18.648
How am I supposed to have
any money?

50:18.681 --> 50:23.586
You know how the people in this
dirt town pay me for my services?

50:23.619 --> 50:27.590
They pay me with pies
and fabric and grain.

50:27.623 --> 50:31.094
Mrs. potts paid me
for treating

50:31.126 --> 50:33.329
her husband's broken foot
with a chicken.

50:33.362 --> 50:37.400
What the hell am I supposed
to do with a damn chicken?

50:37.432 --> 50:39.436
Ended up selling it
to Annie's eatery

50:39.469 --> 50:41.371
for a few pennies,
that's what I did.

50:41.403 --> 50:44.474
What money you do get,
you drink and gamble away.

50:44.507 --> 50:47.309
Yeah, I owe the saloons
in this town.

50:47.342 --> 50:50.512
But the barrell top won't let me
in the main door anymore

50:50.545 --> 50:54.283
and the owner of the dogwood
threatened me.

50:54.317 --> 50:56.318
Threatened you how?

50:56.351 --> 50:57.853
With bodily harm, damn it!

50:57.887 --> 51:00.256
He promised to break
one of my fingers

51:00.289 --> 51:02.459
if I didn't give him any money
this very week.

51:02.492 --> 51:04.427
And then continue
to break bones

51:04.460 --> 51:07.463
until my debt's paid
or I'm dead.

51:07.496 --> 51:10.599
Well, there you have it,
sheriff.

51:10.632 --> 51:12.568
It's probably about time
you take Danny holt out

51:12.601 --> 51:15.270
and put Lucy and the doctor in,
don't you think?

51:15.304 --> 51:17.474
I suppose so.
Let's go.

51:17.507 --> 51:19.675
And what about my gun?

51:19.708 --> 51:23.480
Well, I suppose it's evidence,
isn't it?

51:23.512 --> 51:25.581
I mean, we have to
hold on to it.

51:25.614 --> 51:27.883
I suppose we got enough
witnesses here

51:27.916 --> 51:31.286
for depositions
about what's happened.

51:31.320 --> 51:33.556
It hasn't been fired.

51:33.588 --> 51:36.860
I don't seen any reason why we
can't give him his piece back.

51:36.893 --> 51:39.563
Well, that's that, then.

51:49.771 --> 51:53.308
Lucy, what should I do?

51:53.342 --> 51:55.846
Go home, you damn fool.

52:18.701 --> 52:21.838
Thank you for everything.

52:21.871 --> 52:24.240
I know you didn't want them
to take me.

52:24.273 --> 52:26.376
Go on, now.
We'll talk later.

52:26.409 --> 52:28.311
About time we did.

52:39.956 --> 52:41.791
I guess I know why
you were set on

52:41.824 --> 52:44.827
Danny holt not going
to laramie to stand trial,

52:44.860 --> 52:49.832
and it had nothing to do with
what gun had been used, did it?

52:49.864 --> 52:53.702
I mean, if you'd thought of
that, you'd have said so.

52:53.735 --> 52:57.973
Truth is...

52:58.007 --> 53:00.777
You really thought Danny holt
had done it.

53:03.679 --> 53:06.615
You had me fooled
on that one, sheriff.

53:06.648 --> 53:10.252
You're right,
I thought he had done it.

53:10.286 --> 53:12.322
I was so sure,
I told him to stay quiet

53:12.355 --> 53:13.990
and I'd get him
out of it somehow,

53:14.023 --> 53:18.428
but damn fool I am,
I almost got him hung.

53:18.460 --> 53:22.731
Well, you didn't know
about Lucy silver.

53:22.764 --> 53:25.300
You gonna arrest me, too,
Marshall?

53:25.333 --> 53:26.868
After all,
I was protecting a suspect

53:26.902 --> 53:28.871
I thought
was guilty as hell.

53:31.539 --> 53:34.943
No, I don't suppose I will.

53:34.976 --> 53:37.012
I don't expect I can arrest
the whole damn town

53:37.045 --> 53:38.880
on one night now, can I?

53:38.914 --> 53:42.485
Well, that's a relief
to hear that.

53:42.518 --> 53:45.954
I don't know if you're
a bad man, sheriff.

53:45.987 --> 53:49.791
Probably not.

53:49.824 --> 53:52.428
A better man might have
acknowledged the boy, though.

53:55.864 --> 53:58.834
I got a wife, Marshall white,
and standing in the community.

53:58.867 --> 54:00.902
I just couldn't lose
all that.

54:00.936 --> 54:03.740
I just couldn't, so I just tried
to help him in little ways.

54:03.773 --> 54:06.675
What the hell are you two
talking about?

54:10.346 --> 54:13.048
Well, I'll be damned.

54:13.081 --> 54:16.318
The high and mighty sheriff

54:16.351 --> 54:19.489
is Danny holt's
shameful daddy.

54:22.023 --> 54:25.560
-Come on.
-Well, ain't that a laugh?

54:25.594 --> 54:29.365
Don't put me in there with her.
She's already put a gun to my head.

54:29.398 --> 54:32.302
Doc,
it's just for the night.

54:35.371 --> 54:37.573
I won't bite...

54:37.606 --> 54:38.541
Much.

54:40.675 --> 54:43.045
Well, you don't seem too concerned
with the fix you're in.

54:43.079 --> 54:45.648
Hell.

54:45.681 --> 54:48.918
I've gotten out of worse
than this, Moses,

54:48.951 --> 54:52.954
and you have me now,
and, yes,

54:52.987 --> 54:56.358
you'll take me
to laramie tomorrow.

54:56.391 --> 54:58.960
But you'll see me again.

54:58.994 --> 55:01.963
You put up a good front, Lucy,
I'll give you that.

55:01.996 --> 55:03.932
But if you weren't scared,

55:03.965 --> 55:08.438
you wouldn't have risked
everything to try and escape.

55:08.471 --> 55:10.972
And you and I
both know that,

55:11.005 --> 55:13.875
well, you're facing
either prison

55:13.909 --> 55:16.079
or the noose in laramie.

55:16.112 --> 55:19.981
I hate to say it,
but that's the truth.

55:20.014 --> 55:23.920
You can go straight to hell,
Marshall white.

55:23.952 --> 55:25.822
So can you.

55:25.855 --> 55:27.789
Why me?

55:27.822 --> 55:29.425
'Cause.

55:34.496 --> 55:37.399
I'll be at Henry Mannors' hotel
if anybody needs me.

55:37.432 --> 55:39.969
Marshall, thank you.

55:40.001 --> 55:44.940
Danny'd still be in that cell
if it wasn't for you.

55:44.974 --> 55:48.411
All right.

55:48.443 --> 55:50.480
Hey,

55:50.512 --> 55:55.117
what can you tell me
about the dogwood pass saloon?

55:55.150 --> 55:58.855
Nice place.
Liquor, games, music.

55:58.887 --> 56:01.090
-Got two pianos.
-What about the owner?

56:01.123 --> 56:02.992
Harlan Pritz,
he's a hardcase,

56:03.025 --> 56:04.527
but, you know...

56:04.559 --> 56:05.862
Do you believe
he threatened doctor moss?

56:05.894 --> 56:09.599
I don't know about that.

56:09.632 --> 56:12.467
You don't?

56:12.501 --> 56:14.170
Would you know if he ran
a crooked game?

56:14.202 --> 56:17.507
I've heard rumors of such,
but I haven't seen any evidence.

56:17.539 --> 56:20.777
Afraid that's all
I can tell you.

56:20.809 --> 56:25.480
All right, then.

56:25.514 --> 56:28.184
-See you in the morning.
-Good night, Marshall.

56:28.217 --> 56:29.552
Good night.

56:29.585 --> 56:31.454
You have a good evening,
Marshall.

57:03.952 --> 57:06.521
Well.

57:06.554 --> 57:08.457
Decided to give it
another try, I see.

57:08.490 --> 57:10.460
Smart man.

57:10.492 --> 57:12.795
You know, the more you do it,
the better your chances.

57:12.827 --> 57:14.630
Place your bet, my friend.

57:18.266 --> 57:21.670
All right.

57:21.704 --> 57:24.941
Now you just focus on the one with the
little pea in the middle right here.

57:24.974 --> 57:25.875
Shouldn't be too hard.

57:28.844 --> 57:30.447
All right.

57:39.954 --> 57:43.525
Unh.

57:46.027 --> 57:48.763
Well!

57:48.797 --> 57:51.668
We have a winner.
Congratulations.

57:53.702 --> 57:55.638
And that goes for everybody
out there.

57:55.670 --> 57:57.239
Y'all can win this game.

58:15.824 --> 58:17.659
I thought you were
in Sheridan.

58:17.693 --> 58:21.163
I was. Now I'm here in dogwood
pass looking for you.

58:21.195 --> 58:22.797
Doesn't look like
you're looking for me.

58:22.831 --> 58:26.035
It looks like you're
drinking your dinner.

58:26.068 --> 58:28.571
Checked the hotel.
You weren't there.

58:28.603 --> 58:30.138
Figured you'd make your way
here sooner or later.

58:30.172 --> 58:32.074
Well, you were wrong.

58:32.106 --> 58:33.809
I was on my way past
to the hotel.

58:33.842 --> 58:37.146
But now you're here,
so I was right.

58:37.179 --> 58:39.916
You look tired.
Have a seat.

58:39.949 --> 58:42.719
Wade, you don't know
the half of it.

58:46.621 --> 58:49.525
I got into town
this evening...

58:52.360 --> 58:54.629
After running all the way
from rawlins.

58:54.663 --> 58:58.166
Come here to pick up
a murder suspect

58:58.199 --> 58:59.935
to take to laramie.

58:59.969 --> 59:04.706
Damn if I didn't walk
into a hornet's nest.

59:04.739 --> 59:06.608
Yeah, first off,
there's this mayor

59:06.641 --> 59:10.679
that I'm pretty sure is skimming
off the town coffers.

59:10.713 --> 59:13.950
Then there's a doctor that's so
desperate to pay off his gambling debts

59:13.983 --> 59:17.820
that he's willing to help
a murderess escape.

59:17.853 --> 59:20.655
And then there's
the sheriff himself,

59:20.688 --> 59:23.858
who got a shameful secret,

59:23.891 --> 59:26.127
and he's trying
to protect someone

59:26.161 --> 59:27.797
he's pretty sure
is a killer.

59:27.829 --> 59:29.764
Sounds like the pillars
of the community

59:29.797 --> 59:31.166
have their feet
anchored in the sand.

59:31.199 --> 59:33.702
Well, they surely do.
They surely do.

59:33.735 --> 59:36.304
And it was brought about
by one devious woman

59:36.338 --> 59:39.275
who's trying to keep her neck
out of the noose as well.

59:39.307 --> 59:41.911
My god, Wade,
I don't think I've seen

59:41.943 --> 59:46.014
a more desperate group
of people in my entire life.

59:46.047 --> 59:49.718
Been a long time since
I've seen you so frustrated.

59:49.751 --> 59:51.186
Have a drink.

59:53.121 --> 59:55.724
All right, just one,

59:55.757 --> 59:57.259
and then I'm wanting
some bed.

01:00:02.164 --> 01:00:04.067
You had a glass
waiting for me.

01:00:06.768 --> 01:00:08.770
Told you
I was expecting you.

01:00:08.804 --> 01:00:11.773
Seems like I know you
better than you do.

01:00:20.248 --> 01:00:22.183
Yeah, they did this earlier.

01:00:22.217 --> 01:00:24.253
Both are good.

01:00:24.286 --> 01:00:25.755
Watch the girl.

01:00:30.291 --> 01:00:32.327
How does she do that?

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:35.030
Don't know,
but she does it.

01:00:35.063 --> 01:00:36.398
I couldn't do that
right side up.

01:00:36.431 --> 01:00:38.700
Me neither,
which would explain why

01:00:38.733 --> 01:00:41.003
they're not
applauding for us.

01:00:50.344 --> 01:00:52.313
That is a hell of an act.

01:00:52.347 --> 01:00:54.283
It is.

01:00:54.315 --> 01:00:56.418
This is quite a saloon.

01:00:56.452 --> 01:00:59.789
Yeah.
Gaming, liquor, whores.

01:00:59.822 --> 01:01:03.059
It's about everything
some fellas would want.

01:01:03.092 --> 01:01:05.126
I heard the owner's
a real hardcase.

01:01:05.159 --> 01:01:06.695
Strong-arm type.

01:01:06.728 --> 01:01:08.830
Been threatening people.

01:01:08.864 --> 01:01:12.134
I suppose you want
to get into that.

01:01:12.166 --> 01:01:16.137
-I wouldn't mind.
-He got a name?

01:01:16.170 --> 01:01:18.073
Harlan Pritz.

01:01:26.114 --> 01:01:27.949
You boys need anything else?

01:01:27.983 --> 01:01:30.486
Harlan Pritz,
he here tonight?

01:01:30.518 --> 01:01:33.254
He's in the office.
You know him?

01:01:33.288 --> 01:01:35.824
I'd like a word with him
if possible.

01:01:35.858 --> 01:01:37.760
Well, I'll see.

01:01:41.329 --> 01:01:43.898
So, before
Mr. Pritz gets here

01:01:43.931 --> 01:01:46.134
and you ruin his night,

01:01:46.168 --> 01:01:49.137
mind telling me about this
prisoner you gotta transport?

01:01:49.170 --> 01:01:52.073
Well, the prisoner is
this young fella,

01:01:52.106 --> 01:01:54.976
only it turns out
he didn't do the killing.

01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:57.413
See, I was on the trail
of Lucy silver

01:01:57.445 --> 01:01:58.748
when I was in rawlins.

01:01:58.780 --> 01:02:00.248
I knew that, too.

01:02:03.351 --> 01:02:06.855
Wade loveless, U.S. Marshall
and fortuneteller.

01:02:06.889 --> 01:02:08.390
Well, why don't you tell me
what I'm gonna do?

01:02:08.422 --> 01:02:10.391
You're touchy tonight.

01:02:10.425 --> 01:02:11.994
Tell your story.

01:02:12.027 --> 01:02:14.429
Well, long story short...

01:02:14.463 --> 01:02:16.365
Boy, that would be nice
for a change.

01:02:16.398 --> 01:02:19.835
Well, it turns out
Lucy's in town.

01:02:19.867 --> 01:02:25.340
She's here under the name
of Mrs. Camille Tammery.

01:02:25.373 --> 01:02:27.108
There a Mr. Tammery?

01:02:27.141 --> 01:02:28.977
Well, there was.

01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:32.014
He'd be the dead husband
over in the undertaker's place.

01:02:32.047 --> 01:02:33.782
Lucy killed him?

01:02:33.815 --> 01:02:35.451
Yep.

01:02:35.483 --> 01:02:37.786
I'm Harlan Pritz,
the owner here.

01:02:37.820 --> 01:02:39.355
You asked to see me?

01:02:39.387 --> 01:02:43.391
Mr. Pritz, it's a mighty fine
saloon you got here.

01:02:43.425 --> 01:02:45.795
I know.
What can I do for you?

01:02:45.827 --> 01:02:48.364
You can start by running
straight games,

01:02:48.396 --> 01:02:51.366
and you can stop threatening
people that owe you.

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.135
And if somebody's losing
and can't afford to pay,

01:02:54.168 --> 01:02:55.871
then you throw them out.

01:02:55.903 --> 01:02:57.139
You don't keep
stringing them along

01:02:57.172 --> 01:02:58.507
and running up their debt.

01:02:58.539 --> 01:02:59.942
What the hell are you guys?

01:02:59.974 --> 01:03:02.110
Name's Moses white.

01:03:02.143 --> 01:03:03.411
This is my partner,
Wade loveless.

01:03:03.445 --> 01:03:06.981
Yeah.
Yeah, I heard about you guys.

01:03:07.014 --> 01:03:09.150
You got quite a reputation
throughout the territory.

01:03:09.184 --> 01:03:13.122
We've heard a bit
about you, too.

01:03:13.155 --> 01:03:15.257
Now here's what's what.

01:03:15.289 --> 01:03:17.992
We're going to start sending
ringers in here to try your games.

01:03:18.025 --> 01:03:20.962
And if everything pans out
to be straight,

01:03:20.996 --> 01:03:23.499
well, then all will be well.

01:03:23.532 --> 01:03:25.501
But if it doesn't,

01:03:25.534 --> 01:03:29.038
Marshall loveless and I
will come back and clean house.

01:03:29.070 --> 01:03:30.972
And you'll be
the first to go.

01:03:31.005 --> 01:03:33.141
You savvy?

01:03:33.175 --> 01:03:35.945
That's simple enough,
I guess.

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:40.316
Well, we made it simple
just for you.

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:43.452
People don't normally talk to me
the way you fellas are

01:03:43.485 --> 01:03:45.086
because most people
know better.

01:03:45.119 --> 01:03:47.155
Well, I guess we don't.

01:03:47.188 --> 01:03:49.324
Why don't you just
go on now?

01:03:59.534 --> 01:04:02.403
You send the boy down to the
sheriff's office right away

01:04:02.436 --> 01:04:05.141
and bring Tom Ramey up here
on the double.

01:04:11.112 --> 01:04:13.014
Where'd I leave off?

01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:18.953
Lucy silver.
Where's she at now?

01:04:18.987 --> 01:04:20.923
She's over locked up.

01:04:20.956 --> 01:04:22.358
I'm going to take her
to laramie in the morning,

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:24.360
her and her accomplice.

01:04:24.393 --> 01:04:25.994
Nope.

01:04:27.396 --> 01:04:30.298
What?

01:04:30.331 --> 01:04:32.967
Lucy and her accomplice will have
to sit for a couple of days.

01:04:33.001 --> 01:04:34.570
Marshall bird's coming through
to transport 'em.

01:04:34.603 --> 01:04:37.072
Well, he's coming through
to transport one prisoner,

01:04:37.105 --> 01:04:40.108
but I figure
he can take two, right?

01:04:40.141 --> 01:04:42.344
Why is that?

01:04:42.376 --> 01:04:44.480
Because you and I
have to hightail it to donner.

01:04:47.949 --> 01:04:50.685
You going to tell me
why we need to go to donner?

01:04:50.719 --> 01:04:53.521
Well, some fellas,
they robbed a bank there.

01:04:53.554 --> 01:04:57.025
A good sum of money.
Shootout ensued.

01:04:57.059 --> 01:05:00.362
Sheriff Bixby and a deputy
got killed.

01:05:00.394 --> 01:05:01.963
Lucas Bixby's dead?

01:05:01.996 --> 01:05:03.398
Afraid so.

01:05:05.701 --> 01:05:08.336
That's a damn shame.

01:05:08.369 --> 01:05:09.704
He was a good man.

01:05:09.737 --> 01:05:11.539
Damn fine lawman, too.

01:05:11.572 --> 01:05:14.275
Yeah, he was.

01:05:14.309 --> 01:05:16.711
Anyway, the boys that,
killed 'em,

01:05:16.744 --> 01:05:19.347
they got killed themselves.
A few of 'em got away.

01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:21.250
We are supposed to go
post haste

01:05:21.282 --> 01:05:23.251
to see if we can pick up
their trail.

01:05:23.284 --> 01:05:24.686
Post haste?

01:05:26.755 --> 01:05:28.289
That means right away.

01:05:28.322 --> 01:05:30.025
I know what it means.

01:05:30.057 --> 01:05:31.293
Then why'd you ask?

01:05:41.202 --> 01:05:43.505
What's the emergency,
Harlan?

01:05:43.538 --> 01:05:45.373
They are, Tom.

01:05:45.407 --> 01:05:48.077
-Moses white?
-You know that bastard?

01:05:48.110 --> 01:05:50.112
He's the Marshall that came
to pick up the prisoner.

01:05:50.144 --> 01:05:51.612
I don't know the other fella.

01:05:51.646 --> 01:05:53.248
The other fella's
a Marshall, too, Tom.

01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.150
His name's Wade loveless.

01:05:55.182 --> 01:05:57.385
They've got quite the reputation
in the territory.

01:05:57.418 --> 01:05:59.187
So what's the problem?

01:05:59.221 --> 01:06:02.291
So the problem is, they just
threatened to close me down.

01:06:02.324 --> 01:06:04.126
Why?

01:06:04.159 --> 01:06:06.595
Apparently someone's been
saying bad things about me.

01:06:06.628 --> 01:06:08.764
Have any idea
who that might be?

01:06:08.797 --> 01:06:10.632
Marshall white was asking
some questions,

01:06:10.664 --> 01:06:12.333
but I put him off
as best I could.

01:06:12.367 --> 01:06:15.738
Your best
ain't good enough, Tom.

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:17.673
Well, they're leaving
in the morning.

01:06:17.706 --> 01:06:20.209
They're taking Lucy silver
to laramie to stand trial.

01:06:20.242 --> 01:06:22.577
Lucy silver? Who's that? What
trial are you talking about?

01:06:22.610 --> 01:06:24.779
It's Camille Tammery's
real name.

01:06:24.813 --> 01:06:27.548
Turns out she killed
her husband herself.

01:06:27.581 --> 01:06:31.353
So, you end up getting
your son off after all.

01:06:31.385 --> 01:06:32.688
He didn't do it.

01:06:32.721 --> 01:06:35.556
Tom, what the hell
is going on here?

01:06:35.590 --> 01:06:39.094
I heard about the council members
having a fight out in the street.

01:06:39.126 --> 01:06:42.563
And what,
now doc moss is in jail?

01:06:42.597 --> 01:06:45.367
Well, he tried to help
Lucy escape.

01:06:45.400 --> 01:06:46.802
And it turns out
he's so scared of you

01:06:46.835 --> 01:06:48.737
he was gonna take money
from her to pay you off.

01:06:48.769 --> 01:06:51.039
Well, how can he pay me
if he's in prison?

01:06:51.072 --> 01:06:53.808
What? You want me to just write
off that debt? Is that it?

01:06:53.842 --> 01:06:55.477
Harlan, you need to slow down.

01:06:55.510 --> 01:06:56.678
You know how you get
when you're drunk.

01:06:56.710 --> 01:06:59.047
Besides,
with the marshalls here,

01:06:59.081 --> 01:07:00.382
we don't need any trouble
right now.

01:07:00.414 --> 01:07:01.682
You don't tell me
what we need, Tom!

01:07:01.715 --> 01:07:03.786
You don't have the first
goddamn idea!

01:07:03.818 --> 01:07:06.087
You've lost control
of this town.

01:07:06.121 --> 01:07:07.456
We got a murder in the hotel,

01:07:07.489 --> 01:07:09.557
we got councilmen fighting
in the street.

01:07:09.590 --> 01:07:12.560
We got doc locked up in jail
with my money in his pocket,

01:07:12.594 --> 01:07:15.164
and now these goddamn marshalls
coming here threatening me?

01:07:15.197 --> 01:07:17.633
Me, Tom!
And everything I've built!

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:19.635
Well, let me
tell you this, Tom.

01:07:19.668 --> 01:07:21.537
I'm not gonna go down alone.

01:07:21.570 --> 01:07:23.138
If I go down,
you're going down.

01:07:23.170 --> 01:07:24.439
Don't think I ain't
gonna blab about

01:07:24.472 --> 01:07:25.606
how you've been padding
your pockets

01:07:25.639 --> 01:07:27.175
while I'm running my game.

01:07:27.208 --> 01:07:28.743
You can't do that.
It'll ruin me.

01:07:28.777 --> 01:07:31.612
-My wife...
-It's what you deserve, Tom.

01:07:31.646 --> 01:07:32.681
Ever since
this dead husband business,

01:07:32.713 --> 01:07:34.449
this whole town's gone to shit,
and you've let it.

01:07:39.121 --> 01:07:41.190
Harlan, I've got things
under control.

01:07:41.222 --> 01:07:43.525
Like hell you have!

01:07:43.557 --> 01:07:46.128
But don't worry, Tom,
I'll get us back to square.

01:07:46.161 --> 01:07:47.496
Give me that six-shooter.

01:07:52.467 --> 01:07:54.403
Them marshalls
is getting ready to leave.

01:07:54.436 --> 01:07:56.771
You grab that ten-Gauge and you
follow me out back, all right?

01:07:56.804 --> 01:07:59.307
Harlan,
those are U.S. marshalls.

01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:01.442
Are you crazy as well as drunk?
You just can't...

01:08:01.476 --> 01:08:04.278
Tom, we do not have
any choice.

01:08:04.311 --> 01:08:06.714
They are gonna tear down
everything we've built here,

01:08:06.748 --> 01:08:10.686
if not now, then later.
They are gonna come back, Tom.

01:08:10.719 --> 01:08:12.820
Marshall white as much
as told me so.

01:08:12.853 --> 01:08:14.789
You are the sheriff
in this town.

01:08:14.822 --> 01:08:16.657
You can cover up
anything that we do tonight

01:08:16.689 --> 01:08:19.728
and no one in this town
is gonna dare oppose me.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:23.765
We could do this
and we can get away with it.

01:08:23.796 --> 01:08:27.234
-Now come on.
-Harlan, just listen to me.

01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:30.770
No, Tom, you listen to me.
You're in this as deep as I am.

01:08:30.805 --> 01:08:34.877
Now it is time for you to man up
and show me what you got.

01:08:34.908 --> 01:08:37.813
Or not.
Come on, let's go.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.506
Marshall!
I'd have a word with you!

01:09:10.810 --> 01:09:11.712
Harlan, don't.

01:09:16.484 --> 01:09:18.886
Sheriff Ramey!

01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:20.689
I don't know what your part
in all this has been,

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.358
but you do not have
to die tonight.

01:09:23.390 --> 01:09:25.827
-Don't go out like this.
-Better listen to him, friend.

01:09:29.863 --> 01:09:31.933
No matter what you've been,

01:09:31.966 --> 01:09:35.435
you're still a lawman,
damn it.

01:09:35.470 --> 01:09:36.471
Make the right choice.

01:09:51.586 --> 01:09:53.453
They sure are dead.

01:09:53.488 --> 01:09:56.625
Yeah, well, I just happen
to know the undertaker.

01:09:56.658 --> 01:09:59.895
You weren't lying.

01:09:59.927 --> 01:10:02.297
This is one hell of a town.

01:10:40.368 --> 01:10:42.537
Thank you, Mr. Carver,
for your excellent service.

01:10:42.569 --> 01:10:44.273
You're more than
welcome, sir.

01:10:44.305 --> 01:10:46.974
You come back anytime.

01:10:47.007 --> 01:10:49.912
No offense, Mr. Carver,
but I sincerely hope not.

01:10:56.484 --> 01:10:59.021
Marshall.

01:10:59.054 --> 01:11:01.722
Ma'am.

01:11:01.756 --> 01:11:05.027
That was a mighty fine
breakfast.

01:11:10.664 --> 01:11:13.868
Mr. Carver sure runs
a pretty tight business.

01:11:13.902 --> 01:11:16.605
That's about all I could say
for dogwood pass.

01:11:16.637 --> 01:11:18.539
I am not sorry
to be quit of it.

01:11:21.009 --> 01:11:22.543
No need to check
on the prisoners, I guess?

01:11:22.577 --> 01:11:25.814
Hell no.
No, they can stay in that cell

01:11:25.846 --> 01:11:28.884
till Marshall bird gets here
to take 'em to laramie.

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:31.287
I want nothing more to do
with that lot.

01:11:33.854 --> 01:11:35.890
What about sheriff Ramey?

01:11:35.923 --> 01:11:40.729
Well, I'm not sure
what to do about him.

01:11:40.761 --> 01:11:43.431
He's been up to mischief,
that's for sure.

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:46.668
But I'm not sure
exactly what.

01:11:46.701 --> 01:11:51.539
We could just let him be and let
the chips fall where they do.

01:11:51.573 --> 01:11:54.409
I don't things are gonna turn
out too nice for him anyhow.

01:11:54.442 --> 01:11:57.412
I can't believe you,
you son of a bitch!

01:11:57.444 --> 01:12:01.750
Tell you one thing,
he ain't a happy man right now.

01:12:01.783 --> 01:12:03.719
So you don't want to deal
with him either?

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:05.654
I'm leaving you!

01:12:09.090 --> 01:12:10.592
Nope.

01:12:25.073 --> 01:12:28.076
Yep, unfortunate situations

01:12:28.109 --> 01:12:30.545
in this town,
that's for sure.

01:12:30.578 --> 01:12:32.013
Yeah, it's probably been
that way

01:12:32.046 --> 01:12:34.750
since the first two boards
were nailed together.

01:12:34.783 --> 01:12:37.519
Just took Lucy silver's
husband to bring it out.

01:18:06.012 --> 01:18:07.414
Go home, Henry, you're drunk.

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:15.990
Hello, Henry.

01:18:19.193 --> 01:18:20.195
Camille?

01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:23.898
It's Lucy, you damn fool.

01:18:23.930 --> 01:18:28.235
Now, where's my buggy?
