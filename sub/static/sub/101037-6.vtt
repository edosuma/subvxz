33:58.793 --> 34:00.068
- Oh, good.

34:00.068 --> 34:01.310
I need to talk to
you about something.

34:01.310 --> 34:02.724
The Market Equities Group
made an--

34:02.724 --> 34:05.862
- Of all the promises
I've made in my life, son.

34:07.206 --> 34:09.551
If I didn't love your
mother so much...

34:09.551 --> 34:11.413
I would break it.

34:11.413 --> 34:13.000
I swear to God I would break it.

34:13.000 --> 34:15.068
- Did something happen?
I don't understand.

34:15.068 --> 34:16.965
- What happens in
thirty years, Jamie?

34:16.965 --> 34:18.793
When you, and
your brother and sister

34:18.793 --> 34:20.206
are too old to
fight for this place

34:20.206 --> 34:21.586
and Tate has to fight
for it on his own?

34:21.586 --> 34:22.931
- What are you talking about?

34:22.931 --> 34:25.034
- Lee wouldn't marry,
didn't want children.

34:25.034 --> 34:26.517
I doubt you will either.

34:26.517 --> 34:28.655
And now your sister can't.
She can't because of you.

34:28.655 --> 34:29.724
- Dad, wait.

34:29.724 --> 34:30.724
- Quit moving!

34:33.517 --> 34:35.724
- I didn't. I--

34:35.724 --> 34:38.137
Fuck.

34:38.137 --> 34:40.206
She came to me.

34:40.206 --> 34:42.448
She was scared.

34:42.448 --> 34:43.758
I was scared.

34:43.758 --> 34:46.517
- Why would you take
that from her, Jamie?

34:46.517 --> 34:49.172
Who the fuck did you think
you were to take that from her?

34:49.172 --> 34:51.965
- Hey, hey, hey.

34:51.965 --> 34:53.517
What the hell
is going on here?

34:59.551 --> 35:01.310

What the hell?

Whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:14.586 --> 35:16.172
- All I do is give!

35:17.379 --> 35:19.034
I hate him.
I fucking hate him.
