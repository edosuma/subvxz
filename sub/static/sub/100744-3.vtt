WEBVTT

00:11.560 --> 00:13.920
[Uhtred] <i>I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:14.280 --> 00:16.480
<i>After many long and patient years,</i>

00:16.560 --> 00:19.760
<i>I have journeyed north</i>
<i>to take back my birthright.</i>

00:19.840 --> 00:21.960
-So, Bebbanburg's weakened.
-For now.

00:22.160 --> 00:26.040
<i>I have reunited with my son</i>
<i>and we have begun to forge a bond.</i>

00:26.320 --> 00:29.600
Uhtred, you see these two monks?
They’re leaving for Bebbanburg.

00:29.680 --> 00:31.920
-Follow them.
-I will try and do as you need.

00:32.000 --> 00:36.160
<i>And my life-long friend Beocca</i>
<i>has joined us on this mission.</i>

00:36.240 --> 00:38.400
You came to help me be a better father.

00:38.960 --> 00:40.240
Well, there is that.

00:41.400 --> 00:42.280
<i>In Mercia,</i>

00:42.360 --> 00:46.840
<i>Lord Aethelred’s military commander</i>
<i>Eardwulf has sought an alliance.</i>

00:46.920 --> 00:50.720
[Eardwulf] I heard there was a Dane
willing to betray his kinsfolk for money.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.000
Perhaps we are fated to work together...

00:53.800 --> 00:54.880
Lord Arse-licker.

00:55.160 --> 01:00.880
<i>Aethelred has now left his stronghold</i>
<i>Aegelesburg undefended and vulnerable.</i>

01:02.840 --> 01:06.640
<i>In Wessex, pressure mounts</i>
<i>on King Edward to intervene.</i>

01:06.720 --> 01:09.840
-[Aelswith] Edward, you must not delay.
-Enough!

01:09.920 --> 01:12.640
I will decide how to respond
to this affront and when!

01:13.480 --> 01:16.040
<i>And while the Saxons are in turmoil...</i>

01:16.120 --> 01:17.320
[Finan] Go, go, go!

01:17.400 --> 01:20.560
<i>...my men and I have Bebbanburg</i>
<i>within our grasp.</i>

01:21.440 --> 01:23.680
<i>But we aren’t prepared</i>
<i>for what lies ahead.</i>

01:23.760 --> 01:25.560
You have lost everything...

01:26.560 --> 01:27.400
Osbert.

01:31.440 --> 01:32.720
Put down the bow.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.360
<i>Destiny is all.</i>

01:46.560 --> 01:49.680
[Wihtgar] My father's weakness
drew you here as it drew me.

01:50.440 --> 01:54.560
He could not hold his lands,
so I have put him out of his misery.

01:55.760 --> 01:58.320
Your men, to the wall.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.000
Go. Be ready.

02:03.760 --> 02:04.600
Move!

02:10.800 --> 02:14.400
Have faith.
Your father has escaped worse than this.

02:17.520 --> 02:20.880
Your father stole these lands from me,
when I was a boy!

02:20.960 --> 02:23.280
And he allowed the Scots to ravage them!

02:23.840 --> 02:26.960
If you want men to call you
the true lord of Bebbanburg...

02:27.560 --> 02:28.400
earn it!

02:28.880 --> 02:30.720
Come down and fight me like a man!

02:32.400 --> 02:34.280
I hold the fortress!

02:36.400 --> 02:37.960
I have no need to fight you.

02:43.160 --> 02:45.280
Wihtgar! Lord!

02:47.160 --> 02:50.600
You do not know me.
I was your father's priest.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.440
I knew his strength and his flaws.

02:56.560 --> 02:59.200
This enmity was of his making!

02:59.480 --> 03:00.960
You have settled that!

03:01.560 --> 03:03.280
Now let us make peace.

03:03.920 --> 03:06.760
You are cousins!
Let this be a new beginning.

03:07.440 --> 03:09.440
Unite against your common foe.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.280
Together, you can defeat the Scots,

03:12.360 --> 03:15.680
secure your land,
for the sake of your children.

03:16.480 --> 03:17.880
For all Saxons.

03:20.920 --> 03:23.400
You have spent too long
in Winchester, priest.

03:23.680 --> 03:27.600
And you have forgotten the north.
We do not seek peace.

03:27.680 --> 03:31.640
You are a stranger here, Uhtred Ragnarson.

03:31.720 --> 03:33.840
But I am wiser than my father.

03:33.920 --> 03:37.640
I will not leave a rival alive
to challenge my birthright...

03:38.000 --> 03:39.440
or my bloodline.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.080
I will kill you, Uhtred.

03:42.160 --> 03:43.080
But first...

03:43.560 --> 03:46.120
-you will watch the death of your boy.
-No!

03:46.200 --> 03:48.320
And all the fools
who followed you to your doom.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.440
Don’t! Finan, drop your swords!

03:50.520 --> 03:51.480
Now!

03:51.560 --> 03:53.760
-[Beocca gasps]
-[Wihtgar] This is the end, Uhtred.

03:55.320 --> 03:56.920
Your name will be forgotten.

03:59.960 --> 04:01.440
-[arrow whistles]
-[gasps]

04:13.840 --> 04:14.840
[softly] Uhtred...

04:16.720 --> 04:17.800
Beocca!

04:20.600 --> 04:22.399
[screams]

04:23.279 --> 04:24.320
[all grunt and yell]

04:28.800 --> 04:29.640
No!

04:32.800 --> 04:33.680
[Uhtred] Beocca!

04:33.760 --> 04:36.840
[yelling and grunting]

04:40.160 --> 04:41.720
Make for the ship!

04:41.800 --> 04:44.520
They came from the sea gate.
Destroy their ship!

04:47.720 --> 04:49.880
[Uhtred wails]

04:52.480 --> 04:56.640
[soundtrack music drowns him out]

05:00.160 --> 05:01.800
[roars]

05:01.880 --> 05:04.360
Wihtgar's gone to the walls!
They'll try to sink the ship!

05:04.440 --> 05:05.520
Lord!

05:05.600 --> 05:06.880
-No, Lord! No!
-[roars]

05:07.800 --> 05:11.160
You cannot take him!
All the men will die if you do not go now.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.000
-[pants]
-Uhtred, please!

05:13.080 --> 05:13.920
[pained roar]

05:15.160 --> 05:16.480
-Watch out!
-[yelling]

05:18.280 --> 05:19.880
[roars]

05:20.840 --> 05:22.640
[yelling and grunting]

05:37.480 --> 05:38.360
[grunts]

05:40.400 --> 05:43.840
[Finan] Lord, we must go!
Lord, he’s gone! Come on!

05:45.920 --> 05:48.040
[yelling and grunting]

05:51.640 --> 05:52.760
[groans]

05:56.320 --> 05:57.280
[roars]

05:58.520 --> 05:59.920
[Wihtgar] Aim for their ship!

06:00.000 --> 06:01.360
[catapult creaks]

06:01.760 --> 06:05.200
[Sihtric]
Untie the ship! Osferth, untie the ship!

06:06.600 --> 06:07.640
[guard] Release!

06:10.840 --> 06:12.040
We need to leave soon!

06:12.120 --> 06:13.880
Get in the boat!

06:13.960 --> 06:14.800
[all groan]

06:18.280 --> 06:19.480
We need to get away!

06:19.560 --> 06:22.920
Osferth, start bailing! Where is Uhtred?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.040
-They're over there!
-We need to go now!

06:25.120 --> 06:25.960
[Finan] Get going!

06:27.600 --> 06:28.920
-Go!
-Get in the boat!

06:34.360 --> 06:35.960
Lord! We don't have time!

06:37.280 --> 06:41.120
Uhtred, hurry!
They'll try to sink the bastard boat!

06:41.200 --> 06:44.440
-[Young Uhtred] Come on, Father!
-[Finan] Ready the oars!

06:44.520 --> 06:46.520
-[Sihtric] Easy!
-[Finan] Pull!

06:54.280 --> 06:55.600
[Aidan] Do we follow them?

06:55.680 --> 06:58.480
[Wihtgar] No. He has failed.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.800
He will not last the night.

07:01.480 --> 07:03.840
-[Finan] Pull!
-[all grunting]

07:06.920 --> 07:08.680
[Finan] Pull!

07:10.840 --> 07:12.640
Pull!

07:14.680 --> 07:16.800
-Pull!
-[thunder rumbles]

07:17.960 --> 07:19.720
Pull!

07:21.720 --> 07:23.000
Pull!

08:27.920 --> 08:32.560
[Edward] If we move forward with this,
we stand a chance against Cnut’s army.

08:33.400 --> 08:37.080
Father Pyrlig, you have news from Mercia?
Does Cnut march on Wessex?

08:37.159 --> 08:39.520
Cnut has left Aegelesburg
and is camped near Tameworthig.

08:39.919 --> 08:42.600
And Aethelred?
Do we know where he has gone?

08:42.679 --> 08:46.000
Aethelred has ridden into Daneland
and ravages East Anglia.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.240
He has left his lands undefended

08:48.320 --> 08:51.480
and allowed Cnut to shatter the peace.
His ambition is madness.

08:51.560 --> 08:54.160
And Christian men and women in Mercia
are dying for it.

08:54.240 --> 08:56.600
With Aethelred gone,
they expect your aid, Lord King.

09:00.720 --> 09:03.680
Cnut has not set a camp at Tameworthig
to pillage.

09:06.760 --> 09:08.400
He's cleverer than we imagined.

09:09.040 --> 09:12.640
For years, he has watched us
building burhs in Wessex.

09:13.080 --> 09:16.080
This assault is a provocation
to draw us out into the open

09:16.160 --> 09:18.720
and Cnut has chosen the place
where he means to fight.

09:20.440 --> 09:23.160
There is high ground near Tameworthig.

09:23.240 --> 09:26.840
If he waits there and we come to him,
he will defeat us.

09:26.920 --> 09:28.680
[Pyrlig] We must fight him, Lord King.

09:29.320 --> 09:33.440
-Mercia burns like a lighted fart.
-That is Aethelred's responsibility.

09:33.920 --> 09:35.000
[Aelswith] Lord King.

09:36.080 --> 09:39.440
We have delayed too long already.
When do you ride?

09:39.520 --> 09:43.160
My people suffer, Edward, men who fought
alongside Wessex many times.

09:43.240 --> 09:44.080
[Edward] I know it!

09:44.320 --> 09:49.160
But you ask me to risk ten sons
of Wessex to save ten sons of Mercia.

09:49.400 --> 09:51.000
These are my people.

09:51.080 --> 09:55.000
I will not send them to be slaughtered
while Cnut sets the terms of the battle!

09:55.240 --> 09:58.400
-And your duty to your allies, my Lord?
-I am King of Wessex.

09:58.480 --> 09:59.800
I am sworn to protect it.

09:59.880 --> 10:02.160
Your father was crowned King of Wessex,

10:02.240 --> 10:06.040
but he always sought
to unite the Christian peoples.

10:06.120 --> 10:09.280
In spirit, he was King of all Saxons.

10:10.160 --> 10:11.720
My father is not here.

10:15.880 --> 10:17.600
Aethelred must return.

10:17.840 --> 10:21.000
Father Pyrlig,
you will dispatch messengers to find him.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.080
Steapa will ready our guards.

10:23.160 --> 10:26.320
When our armies are united,
we will face Cnut together.

10:26.400 --> 10:29.800
By the time Aethelred returns,
there will be no Mercia to defend.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.320
This is your decision?

10:33.600 --> 10:34.480
It is.

10:35.240 --> 10:36.680
You will not oppose it.

10:36.960 --> 10:37.800
Edward!

10:48.800 --> 10:50.760
The Ealdormen remain in Aegelesburg?

10:50.840 --> 10:53.800
-Any that were not killed in the attack.
-Aethelflaed...

10:59.960 --> 11:03.240
Edward betrays his father's memory.

11:03.760 --> 11:07.560
He acts in the interests of Wessex.
Perhaps my father would've done the same.

11:07.640 --> 11:08.840
Never!

11:08.920 --> 11:09.960
I am Mercian.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.480
I was married to Alfred to knit
the two kingdoms together,

11:13.560 --> 11:15.280
as you were to Aethelred.

11:16.480 --> 11:21.600
If Mercia falls, then Wessex stands alone
against the Danes.

11:21.680 --> 11:25.640
My duty is now to Mercia, not Wessex.

11:25.720 --> 11:28.360
If there is anything I can do,
I must do it.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.280
I must go to Aegelesburg
to summon the Mercian fyrds.

11:32.680 --> 11:36.080
Edward will see this
as defiance... betrayal.

11:36.160 --> 11:37.760
Edward is not my king.

11:37.840 --> 11:41.200
And you will throw yourself
into the path of the Danes?

11:41.840 --> 11:43.600
Aethelflaed, you are a target!

11:44.320 --> 11:45.480
You'll be killed...

11:46.040 --> 11:48.680
or held for ransom
and not for the first time!

11:49.120 --> 11:50.880
There is no one else to go.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.280
You must not tell Edward I am gone
until I have left Winchester.

11:56.320 --> 11:57.600
Promise me.

12:03.240 --> 12:06.680
Then you must choose a place
for the fyrds to assemble.

12:08.120 --> 12:12.720
There is a valley in Tettenhall,
where lesser numbers might stand a chance.

12:13.120 --> 12:16.280
This is where
you must force the Danes to fight.

12:16.360 --> 12:17.920
The fyrds will not be enough.

12:18.800 --> 12:20.600
I will need Edward's aid.

12:20.880 --> 12:23.600
When you're gone, I will speak to him.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.800
Your brother will not abandon you.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.240
Edward will be there.

13:44.720 --> 13:46.840
[all yelling victoriously]

13:53.440 --> 13:56.120
[horsemen yelling victoriously]

14:14.120 --> 14:19.040
-[Cnut] What do you have for me, Bjorgulf?
-The head of a Saxon turd.

14:19.560 --> 14:22.520
So, another village burns in Mercia!

14:23.400 --> 14:25.520
-[Cnut roars]
-[all roar]

14:25.960 --> 14:29.760
The smell of Saxon blood
stiffens our warriors for battle!

14:30.080 --> 14:31.360
But I hope not your cock.

14:31.960 --> 14:33.600
[warriors laugh]

14:39.160 --> 14:40.920
[low chattering]

14:42.400 --> 14:44.440
[distant shouts]

14:50.720 --> 14:52.280
[neigh of horses in background]

15:00.000 --> 15:02.920
I have no choice here,
but to act the part of his whore.

15:03.560 --> 15:06.040
He tries to dress me
to make me his property.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.800
I swear, I detest the man.

15:08.880 --> 15:12.680
Come with me. I have news
that will put the King in better spirits.

15:12.760 --> 15:15.520
[pants]

15:15.600 --> 15:16.440
[squawks]

15:25.600 --> 15:28.520
I gave you a gift.
Why are you not wearing it?

15:29.480 --> 15:31.600
Am I not beautiful enough without it?

15:32.320 --> 15:33.560
On the surface.

15:34.240 --> 15:35.840
What do you want?

15:35.920 --> 15:37.080
For you, Lord King.

15:38.480 --> 15:39.400
Ah.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.760
Ripped from the hands
of an ugly Dane named Ulf.

15:44.160 --> 15:46.720
We've taken Lindcylne. Word will spread.

15:47.040 --> 15:47.880
[exhales]

15:48.960 --> 15:50.360
And Edward will hear of it.

15:50.440 --> 15:53.480
He will hear that your kingdom
grows greater than Wessex.

15:53.560 --> 15:55.440
That you have taken
what Alfred never could.

15:55.880 --> 15:59.040
While Edward looks like
a weak and timid boy.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.400
You have done well, Eardwulf.

16:03.400 --> 16:04.520
You will be rewarded.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.320
I only ask that I retain command
of your armies, Lord King.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.040
And to restore my family's name.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.280
To lift your decree that every generation
be born into disgrace.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.760
Take all of East Anglia
and I shall consider it.

16:21.880 --> 16:24.080
You are generous, Lord King.

16:24.720 --> 16:28.760
My brother and I will withdraw
to pray for your swift victory.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.440
You may go.

16:31.920 --> 16:32.760
For now.

16:52.600 --> 16:53.480
[Finan] Lord?

16:58.200 --> 17:00.840
Uhtred, the men are tired and hungry.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.480
There's nothing here. We must move on.

17:05.160 --> 17:06.560
Where shall we go?

17:08.000 --> 17:09.560
[Finan] Somewhere with a fire,

17:09.640 --> 17:12.960
an alehouse or a whorehouse
that would raise the spirits, eh?

17:13.040 --> 17:15.599
I must go back. I must retrieve his body.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.119
No, Uhtred, you cannot.

17:18.119 --> 17:20.319
Retrieving his body means nothing now.

17:21.119 --> 17:22.920
His journey in this world has ended.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.359
He is left with thieves and traitors!

17:25.440 --> 17:28.240
He should lie beside Thyra
where his friends can grieve.

17:35.440 --> 17:38.600
Instead, I led him to die among strangers.

17:47.560 --> 17:49.640
I've lost every family I had.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.840
Beocca was always there...

17:56.040 --> 17:57.400
the only constant.

18:01.440 --> 18:03.440
Without Beocca, I have no home.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.840
His death is on my hands. I failed him.

18:14.920 --> 18:15.960
No.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.480
Bless you, Sihtric.

18:25.560 --> 18:26.480
Blessings.

18:34.360 --> 18:35.280
Where is Uhtred?

18:36.200 --> 18:37.240
He walks alone.

18:38.640 --> 18:40.240
I fear his spirit is broken.

18:40.480 --> 18:44.200
The day Uhtred is broken is the day
you grow hair down there, Osferth.

18:44.280 --> 18:45.240
It'll never come.

18:46.720 --> 18:48.760
Now, he lost a friend and grieves him...

18:50.120 --> 18:51.120
as we all do.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.440
He told me we must return south.

18:59.120 --> 19:02.040
Well, come on. We'll need horses
and provisions for the journey.

19:10.080 --> 19:11.040
Buy what you can.

19:12.200 --> 19:13.960
There's a village beyond the ridge.

19:14.040 --> 19:15.800
Try not to spend it all on women.

19:21.320 --> 19:24.240
[Brida hums softly]

19:24.320 --> 19:26.880
[excited chattering in background]

19:38.240 --> 19:40.440
Frigga, tell me I’m not deceived...

19:42.280 --> 19:43.880
that the curse is lifted.

19:48.440 --> 19:50.440
[hums softly]

19:58.760 --> 20:00.240
He grows inside me.

20:10.480 --> 20:13.320
-Any word of the Saxon armies?
-Not yet.

20:15.440 --> 20:18.840
We will burn every village in Mercia
until Edward comes to fight.

20:19.960 --> 20:23.080
There’s a limit to the suffering
the boy king can allow

20:23.160 --> 20:24.760
his fellow Christians to bear...

20:25.720 --> 20:26.960
and we will exceed it.

20:31.080 --> 20:34.120
-Your sons should be here to see this.
-Haesten will keep them safe.

20:35.920 --> 20:38.280
All my children will inherit everything.

20:40.680 --> 20:43.880
And I will slaughter Edward
and Aethelred's armies here.

20:44.680 --> 20:49.520
And when the kings are dead,
we will sit together on Alfred's throne.

20:50.120 --> 20:51.880
-That is my promise to you.
-Mm.

20:55.480 --> 20:56.640
Do it for Ragnar.

20:57.680 --> 20:59.120
We do this in his memory.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.200
For Ragnar.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.520
[chuckles softly]

21:08.560 --> 21:10.560
[murmuring in background]

21:18.480 --> 21:19.680
Lady Aelswith.

21:20.440 --> 21:21.800
Lord Aethelhelm.

21:32.880 --> 21:38.120
You have heard? Cnut burns villages
from Tofeceaster to Fagranford.

21:38.640 --> 21:42.760
He defiles our holy places
and slaughters our priests.

21:43.960 --> 21:47.960
Because I wait for the right moment,
it does not mean I do not care.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.080
-Edward, I must talk--
-[clears throat] Lady.

21:56.040 --> 21:56.960
Yes.

21:57.640 --> 22:00.800
[Aethelhelm] My daughter
called at the nunnery today.

22:02.120 --> 22:07.680
You said the Lady Aethelflaed
had withdrawn there for reflection?

22:08.480 --> 22:09.360
She had.

22:12.120 --> 22:13.320
Then she misled you.

22:14.760 --> 22:15.680
She’s not there.

22:17.880 --> 22:20.080
Concerned for your sister...

22:20.560 --> 22:24.600
I asked Steapa to make further inquiries.

22:26.280 --> 22:28.680
The Lady was seen leaving Winchester.

22:29.440 --> 22:30.280
[exhales]

22:35.840 --> 22:37.080
Where is Aethelflaed?

22:40.720 --> 22:41.640
Mother!

22:43.240 --> 22:45.800
Where has she gone?

22:49.680 --> 22:51.040
She has gone to Mercia.

22:51.560 --> 22:52.400
[plate clatters]

22:58.720 --> 22:59.920
This cannot be true.

23:00.920 --> 23:04.120
I am sorry, Edward, but what was I to do?

23:04.400 --> 23:05.800
I am of Mercia.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.000
And by marriage, so is Aethelflaed.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.360
We could not leave the people to die.

23:10.440 --> 23:11.440
She defied me...

23:12.000 --> 23:14.000
and you defy me.

23:14.600 --> 23:19.080
I only wish to counsel you to follow
the Christian path, as I did your father.

23:19.160 --> 23:21.320
You think I do not fear my God?

23:21.400 --> 23:23.840
I know you have true faith.

23:24.480 --> 23:27.040
But the burden of kingship is heavy.

23:27.960 --> 23:30.600
I have experience, Edward. I can share it.

23:30.680 --> 23:35.080
I have given instructions
that we will fight Cnut on our terms,

23:35.160 --> 23:38.080
when we are prepared
and have the best chance of victory!

23:38.160 --> 23:42.000
Now Aethelflaed has walked
directly into Cnut's trap!

23:42.480 --> 23:47.600
She puts the men of Wessex
and all the Christian kingdoms at risk!

23:48.440 --> 23:49.760
I demand you call her back.

23:50.320 --> 23:53.040
You will show loyalty to your king.

23:53.760 --> 23:58.400
I cannot swear loyalty
to a plan that is misguided!

23:59.240 --> 24:02.400
Aethelflaed will summon the Mercian fyrds
to Tettenhall.

24:02.920 --> 24:05.040
You must join her.

24:35.640 --> 24:37.240
[horse neighs in background]

24:39.720 --> 24:42.880
Lord, forgive my sins
for they are all very grave.

24:43.680 --> 24:49.280
Whoever fears you, Lord God, knows that is
your will and you'll show that man just--

24:49.360 --> 24:51.200
[Uhtred] Stop this nonsense!

24:52.560 --> 24:54.280
I pray for Father Beocca.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.880
Please allow the soul
of Father Beocca to rise to heaven--

24:57.960 --> 24:58.920
Get up!

25:00.120 --> 25:04.040
You think he needs your words, hm?
Do you think I need them?

25:04.120 --> 25:07.280
I know you blame me for his death. [pants]

25:08.160 --> 25:10.720
I am told your God gives mercy.

25:12.240 --> 25:13.240
Where is he?

25:14.200 --> 25:15.160
Where is he?

25:17.800 --> 25:18.960
I’ve never seen him.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.760
It is not my God that you hate...

25:24.200 --> 25:26.000
but the fact that I am not you.

25:51.320 --> 25:52.680
[Finan] Are you all right?

25:52.760 --> 25:56.200
He does not want me!
You know, I will return to the church.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.960
And that's what you want, is it?
To run away?

25:59.360 --> 26:01.160
I remind him of his defeat...

26:02.680 --> 26:04.480
and of Father Beocca's sacrifice.

26:04.560 --> 26:06.120
Oh! The blindness of youth.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.400
Uhtred is a warrior and a father.

26:08.480 --> 26:11.440
It was his job to save you
and he could not. That’s what eats at him.

26:11.520 --> 26:14.680
As a warrior perhaps, but not as a father.

26:16.120 --> 26:18.760
-He has never been a father.
-Because he was absent?

26:19.200 --> 26:21.280
Do you know how many battles he's fought?

26:21.360 --> 26:23.800
How many times he’s sworn oaths
and risked his life

26:23.880 --> 26:27.480
for your Christian kings
at the cost of his own hopes and comfort?

26:27.560 --> 26:31.960
I met your father as a slave,
when we had... nothing.

26:32.440 --> 26:37.840
Now, you look at what you lack,
not what he has given to others.

26:38.960 --> 26:42.560
He fights for Bebbanburg,
not for himself, but for you...

26:43.560 --> 26:45.760
to give you the legacy he never had.

26:46.760 --> 26:47.920
[exhales]

26:49.840 --> 26:50.720
I swear...

26:51.560 --> 26:53.760
he is a great man...

26:54.440 --> 26:57.080
and his blood runs in your veins.

26:59.920 --> 27:01.680
You should be proud to follow him.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.280
[chattering in background]

27:21.360 --> 27:24.640
The men can no longer go on wandering
in the wilderness like this.

27:24.720 --> 27:25.840
They will need silver.

27:25.920 --> 27:28.480
There’ll be opportunity to earn it.
We’re warriors.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.040
There's always battles to fight.

27:30.280 --> 27:34.480
To fight, men need a lord who can lead
them into battle without fear.

27:37.040 --> 27:38.040
I’m tired.

27:38.680 --> 27:40.240
My reputation is waning.

27:40.960 --> 27:42.320
These men depend on you.

27:43.280 --> 27:44.360
[sighs]

27:48.880 --> 27:52.040
I know what you do, Finan.
I know what you say to them.

27:53.240 --> 27:54.840
I’m finished with battles.

27:57.480 --> 28:00.920
I thought that my destiny
was to return to my home.

28:01.000 --> 28:03.200
[breathes heavily]

28:03.280 --> 28:04.200
I have not.

28:05.080 --> 28:06.400
I have lost my lands.

28:07.560 --> 28:08.720
I've lost my name.

28:10.120 --> 28:13.000
I can no longer call myself
Uhtred of Bebbanburg.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.680
[breathes heavily]

28:16.680 --> 28:17.680
I am nothing.

28:23.840 --> 28:27.000
If men want to leave me,
you should let them go.

28:28.640 --> 28:30.200
I can no longer be their lord.

28:49.880 --> 28:51.120
[tapping]

28:56.480 --> 28:57.880
Is there word of Aethelflaed?

28:59.240 --> 29:00.120
No.

29:04.240 --> 29:05.480
She forces my hand.

29:08.440 --> 29:11.000
This is not the vision of England
that I swore to protect.

29:11.560 --> 29:14.720
Yet, these events
could work to your advantage...

29:15.800 --> 29:17.680
and serve your father's vision.

29:18.320 --> 29:24.480
Let the Lord of Mercia
return to defend his wife and lands.

29:25.560 --> 29:30.120
They say Aethelred has 400 men
in East Anglia, no match for Cnut's.

29:32.280 --> 29:37.520
So, the battle will remove the problem
of King Aethelred.

29:39.760 --> 29:41.480
Once Aethelred is gone...

29:42.360 --> 29:44.120
you will defeat Cnut...

29:45.480 --> 29:47.080
and unite the kingdoms.

29:47.920 --> 29:52.760
Edward will fulfill Alfred's dream.

29:54.640 --> 29:57.200
By sacrificing Mercia?

29:58.960 --> 30:00.000
And my sister?

30:00.960 --> 30:07.280
Your father knew that uniting the kingdoms
could not come without a cost.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.920
And your sister...

30:13.040 --> 30:15.000
has chosen her own fate.

30:16.600 --> 30:19.280
[breathes heavily]

30:20.840 --> 30:22.840
[birdsong and rumble of wind]

30:32.760 --> 30:33.600
[sighs softly]

31:44.840 --> 31:48.960
[Finan] Beocca would not want you
to starve or stay destroyed by grief.

31:57.160 --> 31:58.960
He held me on the ramparts,

31:59.040 --> 32:02.440
when Earl Ragnar rode to Bebbanburg
with the head of my brother.

32:06.040 --> 32:08.400
When my father named me Uhtred
in his stead

32:08.480 --> 32:10.680
and told me to die for Bebbanburg...

32:11.680 --> 32:13.120
[breathes heavily]

32:13.200 --> 32:14.960
Beocca was at my side.

32:16.440 --> 32:19.000
He put me into the water to baptize me.

32:20.400 --> 32:23.120
He held me underneath it for so long
I nearly drowned

32:23.200 --> 32:24.840
while he prayed to his God.

32:26.960 --> 32:28.160
[sighs]

32:30.160 --> 32:31.960
He saved my life as a boy...

32:32.880 --> 32:34.040
and as a man...

32:35.080 --> 32:36.120
many times.

32:39.880 --> 32:41.200
He was like a father.

32:42.080 --> 32:43.440
[Uhtred exhales slowly]

32:57.160 --> 33:00.080
[sobs]

33:02.640 --> 33:04.080
[Finan] Hey, it's all right.

33:04.160 --> 33:08.280
He'll have no grave...
no place blessed by his god.

33:08.880 --> 33:10.480
He is with God now.

33:11.560 --> 33:14.720
And with your sister. He is at... peace.

33:18.000 --> 33:20.200
Hm? I'm sure he’d be touched
how you mourn for him

33:20.280 --> 33:23.240
while we're stuck in the middle
of nowhere. But if he were here now,

33:23.320 --> 33:25.240
he would tell you this is not the end.

33:27.200 --> 33:29.400
-We will gather more men.
-[Uhtred exhales]

33:29.480 --> 33:32.760
We will return with an army
and batter down the gates.

33:32.840 --> 33:34.200
[inhales sharply]

33:34.800 --> 33:35.640
[softly] Yeah.

33:39.080 --> 33:41.560
[sobs softly and exhales]

33:47.800 --> 33:49.560
[chatter of men in background]

33:58.480 --> 33:59.800
What brings you here?

34:00.080 --> 34:02.640
I ride from Wessex
with a message from King Edward.

34:03.120 --> 34:04.240
You may tell it to me.

34:04.760 --> 34:07.960
I have instructions to deliver it
to Lord Aethelred and him only.

34:08.440 --> 34:09.800
I command the King's Guard.

34:11.280 --> 34:14.560
No doubt you’ve heard stories about
the King, about his delicate temperament.

34:14.639 --> 34:18.760
I'm telling you he does not wish to be
disturbed, so, if you want to test it...

34:20.920 --> 34:22.920
Cnut's armies have attacked Mercia.

34:23.239 --> 34:24.719
The Lord's estate has fallen.

34:26.080 --> 34:27.560
The heart of Mercia is gone.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.360
[exhales]

34:40.639 --> 34:42.080
They’ve taken everything?

34:49.080 --> 34:50.120
[grunts]

34:52.120 --> 34:54.560
[groans]

34:58.360 --> 34:59.280
[messenger groans]

35:06.880 --> 35:07.720
[Finan whistles]

35:08.360 --> 35:09.240
Danes.

35:10.480 --> 35:13.400
-[Uhtred] It is Haesten.
-[Sihtric] Where is he going?

35:14.160 --> 35:16.800
He’s with his kinfolk.
He'll not want to fight.

35:17.720 --> 35:19.080
[Haesten] Uhtred Ragnarson!

35:19.680 --> 35:23.240
[chuckles] I thought I could smell
something rotten on the air!

35:23.320 --> 35:26.760
We should kill him now, Lord,
while we have the chance.

35:26.840 --> 35:30.280
I've had enough of fighting Danes,
even weasels like Haesten.

35:30.360 --> 35:32.840
Uhtred and his pretty boys...

35:33.360 --> 35:36.200
looking so sad and far from home.

35:36.760 --> 35:37.600
Why?

35:38.160 --> 35:41.720
It's none of your concern. Let us pass
and I will not cut off your head.

35:41.800 --> 35:46.560
[chuckles] I suppose, once more,
you ride out to save the Lady Aethelflaed.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.000
Continue if you like, Uhtred.

35:53.880 --> 35:57.120
It seems
fate has brought us together again.

35:58.160 --> 36:02.400
Your men look like ragged dogs
in need of meat and we have plenty.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.720
We camp here tonight.

36:06.360 --> 36:07.240
Join us.

36:13.720 --> 36:15.720
[excited chattering in background]

36:17.840 --> 36:18.840
[sighs]

36:21.720 --> 36:24.720
Haesten's men say Cnut and Brida
have attacked Mercia.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.880
I knew they did not sail for Irland.

36:27.960 --> 36:30.960
[Finan exhales]
Edward and Aethelred will need us now.

36:31.040 --> 36:32.400
I owe them nothing.

36:34.200 --> 36:35.360
And Aethelflaed?

36:38.560 --> 36:40.360
It is true, I fear for her.

36:40.440 --> 36:41.440
[Haesten] Uhtred.

36:44.240 --> 36:45.080
Join me.

36:47.760 --> 36:49.000
[whistles and clicks tongue]

37:02.360 --> 37:05.320
There was a rumor you had gone north
to regain your lands.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.800
Are you here with your tail
between your legs?

37:08.280 --> 37:12.240
Your men say the Danes have gone to war,
yet you are here, playing nursemaid.

37:13.960 --> 37:16.360
What happened, Haesten?
Have they cut off your balls?

37:16.920 --> 37:20.160
[chuckles] What can I say?
I’m a family man.

37:22.480 --> 37:24.080
I do not see your fat wife.

37:25.760 --> 37:26.760
She died.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.200
-Oh, did she?
-Mm.

37:30.680 --> 37:31.680
[chuckles]

37:33.120 --> 37:37.960
As you know, I once had the desire
to claim Mercia and Wessex for my own.

37:38.960 --> 37:40.960
But that did not go well for me.

37:41.040 --> 37:45.160
And now, like you, Uhtred,
I only want a woman to hump

37:45.240 --> 37:47.040
and a piece of land to call my own.

37:48.320 --> 37:51.880
I had both, in Skade and Beamfleot...

37:52.640 --> 37:54.400
until you took them away from me.

38:00.320 --> 38:01.720
How is Aethelflaed?

38:02.200 --> 38:05.640
In my experience, the bitch
has never known when to lie down.

38:06.320 --> 38:09.080
No doubt
she'll be riding into battle with Cnut...

38:09.680 --> 38:12.520
with her silly husband
and her pretty brother.

38:13.480 --> 38:16.640
And you have always been there
to save her, Uhtred.

38:17.360 --> 38:18.600
But not now.

38:19.600 --> 38:21.080
She does not need me.

38:21.520 --> 38:22.760
Mm.

38:22.840 --> 38:24.200
That’s not what I heard.

38:28.560 --> 38:29.600
How is she?

38:31.320 --> 38:32.320
To bed?

38:33.440 --> 38:36.720
I imagine she squeals, like a big fat pig.

38:38.720 --> 38:39.880
[Finan] Stop it!

38:40.880 --> 38:42.120
[Haesten grunts]

38:42.200 --> 38:43.280
[cackles]

38:43.680 --> 38:44.680
[grunts and groans]

38:46.200 --> 38:47.400
[pants and groans]

38:47.480 --> 38:50.640
Come on, Uhtred!
We were having a nice dinner.

38:51.200 --> 38:52.600
[Haesten gasps for breath]

38:52.680 --> 38:54.080
[groans]

38:56.040 --> 38:57.280
[gasps for breath]

38:57.360 --> 39:00.360
[chuckles]

39:00.440 --> 39:02.000
[grunts]

39:03.320 --> 39:07.800
[grunts] Of course, I would slit
her throat after she’d been ridden!

39:10.040 --> 39:13.840
[pants] Wait, Uhtred.
She’s too well used to fight over.

39:13.920 --> 39:15.280
[Uhtred] Now I will kill you!

39:16.200 --> 39:17.840
[swords clang]

39:18.760 --> 39:19.600
[grunts]

39:20.280 --> 39:21.520
[both grunt]

39:24.640 --> 39:28.240
Wait, wait, wait!
There is something I can give you.

39:28.920 --> 39:31.480
The name of the man that killed Ragnar...

39:32.360 --> 39:33.320
Huh?

39:33.800 --> 39:35.280
-Aethelwold!
-No.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.640
[Haesten grunts]

39:37.960 --> 39:41.120
He held the dagger,
but another whispered poison into his ear.

39:41.520 --> 39:43.600
[grunting and yelling]

39:43.680 --> 39:45.480
[both grunt]

39:46.720 --> 39:48.760
[groans]

39:49.840 --> 39:50.760
[groans]

39:52.120 --> 39:56.160
Let me live... and I'll tell you who gave
the command. [breathes heavily]

39:58.960 --> 39:59.960
[groans]

40:00.560 --> 40:01.400
[gags]

40:02.320 --> 40:03.520
Speak.

40:03.600 --> 40:05.400
[breathes heavily]

40:05.480 --> 40:06.400
Cnut.

40:08.440 --> 40:11.080
He wanted to lead the Danes...
[breathes heavily]

40:11.160 --> 40:13.720
and he wanted Ragnar's woman
who used to be yours.

40:14.400 --> 40:17.760
He told Aethelwold
that Ragnar would kill him.

40:17.840 --> 40:21.080
He guided the blade... [inhales]

40:21.160 --> 40:22.560
into Ragnar's heart.

40:23.040 --> 40:25.080
[breathes heavily]

40:30.600 --> 40:32.080
These are Cnut's sons...

40:34.320 --> 40:35.160
hm?

40:35.240 --> 40:37.040
[breathes heavily]

40:39.960 --> 40:40.960
You can go.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.880
You will leave Cnut's bastards behind.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.840
[Haesten chuckles]
I’m tired of the red-headed runts.

40:49.920 --> 40:51.560
[inhales] You can take them.

40:55.880 --> 40:56.800
[grunts]

41:04.800 --> 41:07.560
-Of course Cnut will hear of this.
-I said go!

41:08.000 --> 41:09.640
[men shout in background]

41:13.200 --> 41:14.080
Finan!

41:14.560 --> 41:16.000
-[Finan] Lord.
-Tie them up!

41:22.560 --> 41:24.600
-[Esgar] Let go!
-Come on.

41:24.680 --> 41:25.960
[groans] Jesus!

41:26.040 --> 41:27.840
[grunts]

41:27.920 --> 41:30.560
No, no, no! Where are you going?
Where are you going?

41:30.640 --> 41:32.120
[boys grunt]

41:34.080 --> 41:35.240
Cnut’s sons?

41:37.080 --> 41:39.440
I thought you did not want to be a part
of this war.

41:56.920 --> 41:59.920
[grunts and pants]

42:02.840 --> 42:03.840
[Eadith] Brother?

42:05.320 --> 42:06.920
-What have you done?
-[pants]

42:07.000 --> 42:08.400
I had to or all is lost.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.800
The rider came from Wessex.
Edward sends word to Aethelred.

42:13.480 --> 42:15.840
[pants] Cnut did not sail to Irland.

42:16.320 --> 42:18.640
The Danes have sacked Aegelesburg
and taken Mercia.

42:19.760 --> 42:20.720
Then you were tricked.

42:20.800 --> 42:23.240
Yes, the Dane Haesten
gave me false information.

42:24.000 --> 42:26.640
And Aethelred left Mercia undefended
upon my advice.

42:26.720 --> 42:29.120
You see now
why he cannot receive this message.

42:29.200 --> 42:31.560
But if Aethelred loses Mercia,
then we lose our position!

42:31.640 --> 42:33.120
You think I do not see that?

42:33.200 --> 42:35.480
Do you think I can bear
to return to nothing?

42:35.560 --> 42:37.160
[both breathe heavily]

42:37.240 --> 42:39.800
But there is benefit
in delaying our return.

42:40.240 --> 42:43.560
If the Lady Aethelflaed throws herself
into the path of the Danes,

42:43.640 --> 42:46.000
it will leave a path open for you.

42:46.080 --> 42:48.480
I've no need of a husband
who used to be king!

42:51.320 --> 42:55.280
You must tell Aethelred the truth
and persuade him to defend his kingdom.

42:55.840 --> 42:58.600
If I tell him the truth, he will kill me.
[pants]

43:02.840 --> 43:04.880
I will do all I can to soften the blow.

43:06.280 --> 43:08.640
[pants]

43:13.560 --> 43:14.600
[sighs]

44:03.920 --> 44:05.840
[tinkle of bell]

44:23.280 --> 44:24.240
Leave us.

44:34.320 --> 44:36.080
Be careful, lady.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.080
Like you...

44:43.480 --> 44:45.240
I'm tired of caution.

45:16.480 --> 45:19.040
[Eadith grunts and gasps]

45:19.760 --> 45:21.200
[Edward gasps]

45:21.640 --> 45:23.640
[pants and moans]

45:30.440 --> 45:31.680
[grunts and gasps]

45:35.800 --> 45:37.880
[chattering in background]

45:43.080 --> 45:44.640
What will you do with the boys?

45:45.080 --> 45:47.720
[Uhtred] We will take them to Aethelflaed
in Mercia.

45:53.440 --> 45:56.000
I remember watching you
ride out from Winchester...

45:56.920 --> 45:59.280
before you fought
at the battle of Fearnham.

46:01.320 --> 46:02.240
I remember.

46:04.960 --> 46:06.160
Your mother was there.

46:12.000 --> 46:13.800
It was the last time I saw her.

46:25.040 --> 46:26.200
I still see her...

46:30.000 --> 46:31.160
in my dreams.

46:32.560 --> 46:33.560
Gisela.

46:38.320 --> 46:40.440
But then I wake and she's gone again.

46:41.600 --> 46:43.400
[inhales and exhales]

46:43.960 --> 46:45.360
I feel her loss also...

46:47.240 --> 46:48.080
every day.

46:59.680 --> 47:01.560
That day I asked her why you left us.

47:02.400 --> 47:05.320
And she said you fought,
because you believed in a cause...

47:06.200 --> 47:08.640
not for God, or the gods...

47:09.120 --> 47:11.080
or for Saxons, or for Danes.

47:13.240 --> 47:15.440
But to keep safe the people that you love.

47:16.280 --> 47:20.400
She said that is why you will always have
the strength to stand up when others fall

47:20.480 --> 47:23.200
and to go on when those around you
say it is hopeless.

47:24.320 --> 47:25.880
It is why these men love you...

47:26.880 --> 47:29.000
and will follow you wherever you go.

47:34.360 --> 47:35.320
As will I.

48:36.960 --> 48:38.960
Creoda.

48:39.040 --> 48:40.400
Lady Aethelflaed.

48:40.480 --> 48:41.800
How many remain here?

48:42.720 --> 48:43.840
Where is the king?

48:46.880 --> 48:48.240
We will find you food.

48:51.160 --> 48:53.280
Search for survivors and bring them here.

48:53.600 --> 48:56.160
We should not delay here.
The Danes could return.

48:57.920 --> 48:58.760
I know.

49:01.800 --> 49:03.840
I have summoned the Mercian fyrds.

49:04.560 --> 49:06.160
They are marching to Tettenhall.

49:06.840 --> 49:09.040
Cnut will pay for this bloodshed.

49:13.000 --> 49:15.360
My husband valued loyalty.

49:15.960 --> 49:16.920
I have been loyal.

49:17.400 --> 49:20.560
-At least as far as I can remember.
-But he was also practical.

49:21.280 --> 49:24.160
If he saw a person
make the wrong decision...

49:25.480 --> 49:27.440
he took action to correct it.

49:31.560 --> 49:34.360
Edward's rule in Wessex is vulnerable...

49:34.960 --> 49:38.200
and Mercia has been left undefended
by its king.

49:38.560 --> 49:40.680
Wessex needs our protection...

49:41.160 --> 49:43.960
and the support
of all our Christian allies.

49:44.400 --> 49:48.880
You will take a message
to the Welsh king, Hywel.

49:50.400 --> 49:53.960
Lady, you are Edward's kin.
If I disobey him,

49:54.040 --> 49:57.840
-he will string me up in the marketplace!
-I know what I ask.

49:59.160 --> 50:02.600
But you have sworn an oath to God, Father.

50:03.480 --> 50:07.880
What use is your mortal life
if you disobey your conscience

50:07.960 --> 50:09.840
for fear of man's vengeance?

50:10.640 --> 50:13.800
You and I must protect the faith,
Father Pyrlig.

50:13.880 --> 50:17.600
Aethelflaed is expecting an army.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.280
We must deliver one.

50:26.360 --> 50:27.440
[Father Pyrlig sighs]

50:35.320 --> 50:38.040
So, the Lady Aethelflaed
has returned to Mercia.

50:38.680 --> 50:40.000
Do you think she's alone?

50:40.840 --> 50:43.680
If she is, the rest of the Saxons
will not be far behind.

50:51.240 --> 50:53.240
Take her and they are in our power.

50:55.320 --> 50:57.880
You will find Aethelflaed
and you will bring her to me.

50:59.120 --> 51:00.880
[all laugh]

51:09.080 --> 51:10.480
[guard] Horsemen!

51:10.800 --> 51:12.800
-Wake the Lady Aethelflaed now.
-Lord.

51:24.840 --> 51:25.680
Uhtred!

51:27.000 --> 51:28.320
What are you doing here?

51:28.400 --> 51:30.440
You two, get those boys off the horses.

51:30.920 --> 51:32.320
Why are you not at Bebbanburg?

51:33.960 --> 51:35.200
What happened?

51:37.400 --> 51:39.000
-Where are the guards?
-[sighs]

51:39.560 --> 51:42.480
You see all we have.
Uhtred, who are those boys?

51:43.240 --> 51:45.120
You should not be here without a guard.

51:45.200 --> 51:47.600
Where should I be?
Decorating Edward's palace?

51:48.000 --> 51:49.760
My place is in Mercia!

51:50.240 --> 51:51.280
[breathes heavily]

51:51.360 --> 51:52.720
What have you done, Uhtred?

51:54.840 --> 51:56.400
They are Cnut's heirs.

51:57.800 --> 52:00.160
Then Cnut will hear of this
and he will come for you.

52:01.240 --> 52:04.360
So, you must get the boys to your armies.
Where are they?

52:04.680 --> 52:07.240
Aethelred is in East Anglia with his men.
[exhales]

52:07.840 --> 52:09.880
I have ordered the Mercian fyrd
to Tettenhall,

52:09.960 --> 52:14.440
and I believe Edward will meet us there,
then we will summon Cnut to fight.

52:14.720 --> 52:16.760
So, you've put yourself in danger.

52:18.440 --> 52:22.240
I do not know if Aethelred is coming
and I had to force Edward's hand.

52:23.120 --> 52:23.960
[sighs]

52:26.560 --> 52:29.440
You should not be here undefended. Finan.

52:29.920 --> 52:31.480
-Lord.
-We leave at first light.

52:31.560 --> 52:34.720
Aldhelm, prepare the survivors.

52:34.800 --> 52:36.600
We march to Tettenhall at dawn.

52:36.680 --> 52:38.640
Every man must be put to watch.

52:39.440 --> 52:40.480
[Aldhelm] Positions.

52:41.920 --> 52:43.960
-[sighs]
-[Aldhelm] Every man to the ramparts!

52:44.040 --> 52:46.040
[excited chattering in background]

52:46.120 --> 52:48.120
Uhtred, what happened at Bebbanburg?

53:03.320 --> 53:04.280
[Uhtred sniffles]

53:18.840 --> 53:20.840
[clatter of armor and horses neigh]
