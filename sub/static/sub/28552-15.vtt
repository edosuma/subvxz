00:05.318 --> 00:08.397
Dr. Atmozphere,
It's time I...

00:08.550 --> 00:10.484
rain on your parade.

00:10.668 --> 00:13.439
Huh. You're not even trying
anymore.

00:13.527 --> 00:15.894
I'm sorry. You're my third
weather-based villain this month,

00:15.982 --> 00:17.909
and between the crime sprees
and the public service

00:17.996 --> 00:19.423
and the... ...everything,

00:19.511 --> 00:21.611
I haven't had the chance
to re-up my puns.

00:21.699 --> 00:22.933
One second.

00:23.021 --> 00:24.127
Hello?

00:24.215 --> 00:25.608
Oh, hi, Huey!

00:25.771 --> 00:28.228
No, no, don't reschedule.
I need a break!

00:28.497 --> 00:31.604
You're too busy to finish
telling me how busy you are?

00:31.692 --> 00:33.755
Gizmoduck, you're burned out!

00:47.485 --> 00:51.278

I rain on your parade.

00:51.547 --> 00:53.899
You literally just said that.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.649
Ugh. I'm sorry.

Sooo, where is this friend?

02:02.278 --> 02:07.774
Oh, Fenton is... very busy.
Working... on robotics!

02:15.319 --> 02:16.420
Sorry I'm late!

02:16.508 --> 02:19.131
Fenton! There ya are!

02:19.219 --> 02:21.936
Ya just missed
a Gizmoduck fly-by!

02:22.024 --> 02:24.087
You're Gizmoduck!

02:24.180 --> 02:25.835
- Huey!
- I didn't say anything!

02:25.923 --> 02:27.336
Hi, I'm Webby!
Nice to see you!

02:27.423 --> 02:29.173
Does your suit have a toilet?!

02:32.161 --> 02:33.915
No matter.
Heroing is well and good,

02:34.003 --> 02:35.336
but today is about science!

02:35.424 --> 02:36.966
About Fenton Crackshell-Cabrera

02:37.053 --> 02:39.006
peeling back
the veil of the unknown

02:39.093 --> 02:40.866
to make a discovery
so revolutionary

02:40.954 --> 02:42.664
that I'll be remembered
as more than just...

02:42.751 --> 02:44.916
<i>- Gizmoduck is in the news...
- And so, once again,</i>

02:45.003 --> 02:48.610
<i>the day is saved,
thanks to Gizmoduck.</i>

02:48.782 --> 02:51.825
Poor Fenton's worn out
from saving the day every day.

02:51.913 --> 02:54.696
The tragic hero
that cares for everyone...

02:54.805 --> 02:56.305
but himself.

02:56.919 --> 03:00.305
Excuse me, I'm looking for your
latest birefringent beam splitters.

03:00.393 --> 03:03.436
Beam splitters, huh?
Cubic or dichroic mirror?

03:03.539 --> 03:06.282
Huh? You know about
dichroic mirror splitters?

03:06.370 --> 03:09.087
Yes. Because I'm a scientist.

03:09.175 --> 03:12.168
High energy physics can be
challenging for a rookie.

03:12.304 --> 03:14.092
Oh, I'm no rookie.
I... I'm a scientist

03:14.180 --> 03:15.506
for McDuck Enterprises,
actually.

03:15.593 --> 03:17.850
Ohh, sell-out science.

03:17.938 --> 03:19.716
Pushing pencils.
Wearing a suit.

03:19.803 --> 03:21.836
Brainstorming
that next Gizmoduck,

03:21.923 --> 03:23.805
like we need more
of that show off.

03:23.893 --> 03:25.133
W-w-wait, I... uh...

03:25.274 --> 03:26.438
W-what is it you do?

03:26.553 --> 03:28.749
Uhh, shatter expectations.

03:30.245 --> 03:31.298
Ugh.

03:31.423 --> 03:33.876
I have no rules, no limits.

03:33.963 --> 03:35.626
I don't kiss up
to zillionaires.

03:35.713 --> 03:37.282
I work for myself.

03:37.370 --> 03:38.907
Actually, I'm working
on my own project

03:38.995 --> 03:40.795
that's pretty neat.
I haven't quite

03:40.883 --> 03:43.086
cracked the equation,
but it's still very dangerous.

03:43.173 --> 03:46.048
The most dangerous
kind of neat.

03:46.136 --> 03:48.732
All right, Suit.
You're doing hard science?

03:48.820 --> 03:50.079
Show me your lab.

03:50.167 --> 03:52.780
Uh, yes. Uh... my lab!
Th-that is mine.

03:52.875 --> 03:56.748
I'll pick you up at seven
for some severe science-ing.

03:56.923 --> 03:58.794
Are they... fighting?

03:58.896 --> 04:02.219
Oh, Webby. This is the standard
romantic courting of adults.

04:02.329 --> 04:04.255
Commonly known as a "meet cute."

04:04.343 --> 04:06.763
Are you sure?
Fenton looks awfully sweaty.

04:06.851 --> 04:09.094
Anxious perspiration.
Intense eye contact.

04:09.213 --> 04:11.239
Coy body language.
Only thing we haven't seen

04:11.327 --> 04:12.784
is the awkward-yet-adorable
accident.

04:12.963 --> 04:17.296
Do you want my name or address
or any means of contact?

04:17.382 --> 04:19.296
Uh, yes, of course,
all of it! Uh...

04:19.458 --> 04:21.262
Love is in the air!

04:25.763 --> 04:28.086
It's Gandra. Gandra Dee.

04:29.460 --> 04:31.763
<i>Customers lining up
for the new WaddleWatch</i>

04:31.851 --> 04:35.042
<i>got an even more exciting
surprise as Gizmoduck...</i>

04:35.130 --> 04:38.045
So, the yellow
or the... yellow?

04:38.133 --> 04:40.296
You need something
more formal. Like a tux.

04:40.383 --> 04:42.296
Ooh! Or a fancy cloak!

04:42.383 --> 04:43.546
I have a lab coat!

04:43.633 --> 04:46.376
You have to dress to impress!

04:46.464 --> 04:49.568
Guys, this is just a professional
meeting of the minds.

04:49.669 --> 04:50.966
That could turn into
a flirtation

04:51.053 --> 04:53.018
that could then blossom
into a loving relationship

04:53.106 --> 04:54.667
for as long
as we both shall live!

04:54.755 --> 04:56.356
But I don't want to
come on too strong.

04:56.451 --> 04:57.451
So, not a date.

04:57.645 --> 05:00.474
A night of romance
is just the break you need.

05:00.575 --> 05:01.862
And, if things don't go well,

05:01.950 --> 05:03.660
you can always reveal
that you're Gizmoduck.

05:03.747 --> 05:05.864
No Gizmo! Just Fenton.

05:06.093 --> 05:07.876
We'll take care of everything.

05:07.963 --> 05:10.586
The lab will be perfect
for your daaaate.

05:10.673 --> 05:12.876
- Not a date!
- What's this about a date?

05:12.963 --> 05:15.626
- It's a little
lab session with a peer.

05:15.713 --> 05:17.546
I should just be myself,
right, M'ma?

05:17.633 --> 05:19.756
Oh, no. Never be yourself
on a first date.

05:19.843 --> 05:21.511
Or a second. Or any dates.

05:21.599 --> 05:24.883
You have to be
the best version of yourself.

05:26.463 --> 05:28.503
Here. This was your dad's.

05:28.591 --> 05:31.376
I've been saving it
for a special occasion.

05:31.544 --> 05:33.336
Have a nice time,
<i>pollito.</i>

05:33.423 --> 05:35.520
Oh and if that girl
breaks your heart,

05:35.614 --> 05:37.126
I will personally hunt her down

05:37.213 --> 05:40.755
and dismantle her life.
Piece by piece.

05:44.383 --> 05:46.284
So-o-o, what's this big date?

05:46.372 --> 05:47.966
- It's not a date.
- Right, of course.

05:48.053 --> 05:49.870
But if it was,
I'd say it's good

05:49.958 --> 05:51.706
to see you find
that special someone.

05:51.794 --> 05:54.026
And that someone
can be many things:

05:54.114 --> 05:57.128
a friend, a confidant,
a deadly ninja,

05:57.216 --> 05:59.182
a forbidden mermaid,
a were-duck,

05:59.270 --> 06:00.880
a clone of yourself...

06:02.883 --> 06:04.336
A Viking Shield-maiden,

06:04.497 --> 06:07.006
a talking cloud of energy
that one time...

06:07.093 --> 06:08.756
Greetings!

06:08.843 --> 06:11.307
Nice upgrade, Suit.

06:11.395 --> 06:13.942
Yeah, you're definitely
the "bad boy of science."

06:14.044 --> 06:16.303
Let's take your limo.
Mine's in the shop.

06:19.263 --> 06:22.544
Get comfy! I'll have ya at your
<i>date </i> in no time! -

06:23.633 --> 06:24.916
You know, there's no pressure.

06:25.020 --> 06:26.370
This doesn't have to be a date.

06:26.458 --> 06:28.046
You don't want this
to be a date?

06:28.133 --> 06:29.796
No, it can be! I mean,
I... I want it to be

06:29.883 --> 06:34.198
what you want it to be!
We're just... two minds melding!

06:34.286 --> 06:35.836
Woof.

06:35.923 --> 06:37.876
<i>♪ It's a date! ♪</i>

06:37.963 --> 06:40.231

06:41.372 --> 06:43.440
My interns should
be prepping the lab right now.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.745
It's a very professional
work environment.

06:47.169 --> 06:50.886
<i>Benvenuti.</i>
Welcome to Giroscopio's,

06:50.974 --> 06:53.879
a place for romance.
<i>Prego, prego, prego!</i>

06:53.967 --> 06:55.231
Please, follow me.

06:58.374 --> 07:01.784
<i>This</i> is your lab?
How do you get anything done

07:01.872 --> 07:03.690
with all this moody
Italian decor?

07:03.778 --> 07:07.046
Yeah, this is not...

07:07.133 --> 07:10.479
<i>Bonjourno,</i> can I
a-tell you about tonight's a-special?

07:10.567 --> 07:12.565
- It's spaghetti!
- Please order it.

07:12.653 --> 07:13.676
It's the only thing we made.

07:13.763 --> 07:15.097
Where is Dr. Gearloose?

07:15.184 --> 07:16.756
Oh, we took good care
of him.

07:16.843 --> 07:19.557
You will rue the day!

07:19.645 --> 07:20.645
What was that?

07:20.778 --> 07:23.442
The, uh, Crackshell-Cabrera
Talk-In Closet!

07:23.591 --> 07:25.161
Will you excuse me a second?

07:26.059 --> 07:27.286
This a disaster!

07:27.395 --> 07:29.276
She's not into
romantic accoutrement.

07:29.364 --> 07:30.534
She's into science!

07:30.622 --> 07:32.666
According to the JWG,
mood is essential.

07:32.754 --> 07:34.659
Without it, how will you two
develop chemistry?

07:34.747 --> 07:35.796
With actual chemistry!

07:37.739 --> 07:39.215
Ugh! What do you want?

07:39.324 --> 07:41.199
Hey, so, I don't like you
not answering my calls.

07:41.286 --> 07:42.925
It makes me feel like
I'm not the only person

07:43.012 --> 07:44.277
in the world,
which is weird for me.

07:44.364 --> 07:46.010
I'm inside the lab, OK?

07:46.098 --> 07:48.752
<i>I want results, Agent D.</i>

07:48.840 --> 07:50.472
You imbeciles! It's a trap!

07:50.559 --> 07:53.296
They're trapping u...

07:53.383 --> 07:56.817
A real scientist
always gets results.

07:58.989 --> 08:00.629
We need to
get rid of this stuff.

08:02.713 --> 08:04.166
Is this spaghetti
tied together?

08:04.254 --> 08:05.549
You're supposed to eat it,

08:05.637 --> 08:07.526
then meet in the middle
for a kiss!

08:07.614 --> 08:09.737
And I'll be ready to capture
the tender moment!

08:09.824 --> 08:12.407
End of the night, we hand out
souvenir photos!

08:12.494 --> 08:17.527
Just science and me and her
and... the moonlight.

08:19.914 --> 08:22.197
Beaks, stop calling!

08:22.356 --> 08:25.096
<i>The serum I made won't work
unless we can get a recording</i>

08:25.184 --> 08:28.067
<i>of Fenton saying the passcode:
"blathering blatherskite."</i>

08:28.184 --> 08:29.979
<i>Those are not everyday words.</i>

08:30.067 --> 08:35.010
But I can't wait!
I'm sick of Gizmoduck

08:35.097 --> 08:37.033
always getting
all the attention!

08:37.121 --> 08:39.616
Ugh! He thinks he's <i> so noble!</i>

08:39.703 --> 08:41.645
<i> Just be patient!</i>

08:42.190 --> 08:45.051
Beaks... eh duh-nuh do patient.

08:47.454 --> 08:49.315
Sorry about my interns'
odd behavior.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.947
They're still under the effects
of a toxic gas leak.

08:52.034 --> 08:53.520
That I assure you
has now been vented.

08:53.621 --> 08:56.112
Been there. Once,
I accidentally unleashed

08:56.200 --> 08:58.627
a nanobot infestation
on my apartment building.

08:58.715 --> 09:00.354
Holy Marconi!

09:00.442 --> 09:02.346
I tried to explain
a protonic reversal

09:02.434 --> 09:04.963
could negate the receptors.
But people don't want

09:05.051 --> 09:06.924
to listen to science.
They called me...

09:07.012 --> 09:08.596
- A kook.
- A menace.

09:08.684 --> 09:10.442
- A crack... pot.
- A crack... pot.

09:11.512 --> 09:14.106
Ms. Dee, shall we science?

09:27.614 --> 09:30.533
Tasty Spray!
Just spritz any food with this

09:30.621 --> 09:32.617
and it tastes
just like glazed donuts!

09:32.797 --> 09:33.797
Like so...

09:35.114 --> 09:37.252
Mmm... glazy!

09:37.340 --> 09:38.541
Mmm mm-hm?

09:38.629 --> 09:40.119
What if you don't like
glazed donuts?

09:40.207 --> 09:43.012
What kind of monster
doesn't like glazed donuts?

09:43.100 --> 09:46.817
You really wanna see something?
Look into my eyes.

09:47.645 --> 09:50.332
- Yes. It's happening.
- Mm!

09:52.254 --> 09:56.051
Eye Buds. Upgrades the eye
into a wireless camera.

09:56.284 --> 09:59.590
Well, set those Eye Buds
on this!

09:59.914 --> 10:01.614
The Universal Solvent!

10:01.702 --> 10:04.104
The future of terraforming
as we know it.

10:04.192 --> 10:05.533
This liquid eats
through anything.

10:05.621 --> 10:07.768
Only the strongest diamonds
are resistant.

10:07.856 --> 10:10.239
So, Rich Boss McDuck

10:10.348 --> 10:13.424
gets to gobble up
all of the Earth's precious gems

10:13.512 --> 10:14.893
for himself.

10:14.981 --> 10:16.815
What's next, some kinda
gold magnet?

10:21.637 --> 10:23.465
Here. Take my hand.

10:26.582 --> 10:27.580
Do you feel that spark?

10:27.668 --> 10:29.121
Aaah!

10:30.653 --> 10:32.830
- What was that?!
- Nanites.

10:32.918 --> 10:36.531
Microscopic robots.
They channel my body's electricity

10:36.619 --> 10:39.265
into usable external power.

10:39.353 --> 10:42.953
You experimented on yourself?
That's incredibly dangerous!

10:43.041 --> 10:45.237
I know! Most of these
pencil-pushers

10:45.324 --> 10:48.820
just theorize and talk...
Uh, what's the word?

10:48.908 --> 10:50.697
Yada yada? Blah blah blah?

10:51.203 --> 10:52.502
<i>Mm, babbling?</i>

10:52.627 --> 10:54.299
<i>Blathering?</i>

10:54.534 --> 10:59.237
Ugh, just one word?
Uhh, this is taking forever!

10:59.478 --> 11:00.929
OK, clearly, Papa needs

11:01.017 --> 11:03.226
to take matters
into his own hands.

11:03.314 --> 11:06.864
Uh, drop a beaks!

11:18.204 --> 11:19.781
<i>♪ Don't let him trick ya ♪</i>

11:19.869 --> 11:21.713
<i>♪ No, no ♪</i>

11:31.614 --> 11:34.027
<i>♪ It's a date ♪</i>

11:34.653 --> 11:38.456
<i>♪ Don't let

11:40.203 --> 11:42.116
<i>♪ It's a date ♪</i>

11:42.204 --> 11:45.581
<i>♪ Don't let

11:55.465 --> 11:58.700
<i>- ♪ Don't, don't, don't ♪
- Access denied.</i>

12:06.372 --> 12:09.325
What, no signal? Boo!

12:09.481 --> 12:12.042
OK, you want punk science?

12:12.130 --> 12:13.932
You want ripping
the fabric of the universe

12:14.020 --> 12:16.182
and bending the elements
to your very will?

12:16.270 --> 12:19.450
My top secret
personal project. Behold!

12:21.270 --> 12:22.527
Fentonium!

12:22.786 --> 12:25.512
A frictionless synthetic crystal
of my own design!

12:26.723 --> 12:29.112
Instead of slowing down
after an initial bounce,

12:29.200 --> 12:31.073
it actually speeds up
and gains energy!

12:31.161 --> 12:32.973
Ada Dovelace,
that's amazing.

12:33.137 --> 12:35.112
Imagine that potential
unleashed!

12:35.200 --> 12:37.309
And incredibly unstable!

12:37.442 --> 12:39.294
Heh. I still need
to crack the equation

12:39.403 --> 12:40.792
or it could tear the lab apart.

12:40.880 --> 12:44.198
An innovative energy generator
from a mild-mannered source.

12:44.286 --> 12:46.324
Like I said. Neat, right?

12:47.747 --> 12:50.809
Yeah. You kinda are.

12:52.762 --> 12:54.157
Hungry, Suit?

12:54.645 --> 12:57.456
OK, OK, they're hungry.
Let's move, people!

12:57.544 --> 12:59.417
Webby: camera.
Manny, Bulb: music.

12:59.505 --> 13:01.614
Me, Huey: food. Order up!

13:03.505 --> 13:05.034
Mwah!

13:13.204 --> 13:15.527
It's really working!

13:15.840 --> 13:17.827
The spaghetti got untied!

13:18.215 --> 13:19.860
Fenton's perfect date!

13:19.948 --> 13:21.448
I need a distraction!

13:45.204 --> 13:47.472
Gandra's a spy for Mark Beaks!

13:47.560 --> 13:50.496
This was all about her trying to
get some passcode from Fenton.

13:50.584 --> 13:53.730
What?! There's nothing in the
romance chapter about spies!

13:53.818 --> 13:56.613
Ohh, this is gonna shatter
Fenton's self-esteem!

13:56.701 --> 13:59.058
Also, he could be
captured by spies!

13:59.146 --> 14:00.769
Two bad things could happen!

14:02.169 --> 14:04.951
<i>Scusi,</i> you have a phone call.

14:06.784 --> 14:09.871
Guys, it's going really well!
Gandra's brilliant and charming

14:09.959 --> 14:11.692
and a little critical,
just like my mother and Gyro

14:11.779 --> 14:13.348
and pretty much everyone else
in my life. Most of all,

14:13.435 --> 14:17.100
Gandra doesn't care about
Gizmoduck, she likes me!

14:17.639 --> 14:19.987
And you guys are just staring.
Why are you staring?

14:20.271 --> 14:23.855
Um... You're... lookin' good
out there, tiger!

14:23.943 --> 14:26.527
Huey! We have some bad news.

14:33.256 --> 14:38.433
You know, I wasn't so sure
about you. But I like this.

14:38.521 --> 14:41.277
You sure you wouldn't like
anything else?

14:41.662 --> 14:43.667
I <i> spy</i> the server right there.

14:43.755 --> 14:45.964
I can <i> Waddle</i> over
and get his attention.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.800
Oh! Uh... no, no, no, no, no.

14:47.888 --> 14:50.605
Uh... But hey! How about
a second date?

14:50.693 --> 14:53.730
We could do a picnic
or get some fresh air.

14:53.818 --> 14:55.356
Go fly a... oh, what are
those things called?

14:55.443 --> 14:57.417
The toy that Ben Frankloon
tied to a key?

14:57.505 --> 14:59.402
I know
what you're here for!

14:59.490 --> 15:02.019
Gizmoduck.
Just like everyone else.

15:02.107 --> 15:05.558
There's a feeling man with feelings
under that synthetic alloy shell!

15:05.646 --> 15:09.394
<i>Whaat?</i> You're Gizmoduck?

15:09.482 --> 15:11.409
You know I am!
Who doesn't?

15:11.497 --> 15:13.034
Blathering Blatherskite.

15:21.152 --> 15:23.034
Is this what you want?!

15:24.296 --> 15:27.409
That's exactly what I want.

15:27.497 --> 15:30.214
You may have the suit,
but I have something better.

15:30.302 --> 15:32.065
A full body upgrade!

15:32.153 --> 15:35.690
That's right.
I drank Dee's nanite serum

15:35.778 --> 15:37.823
and linked it up
with stolen Gizmotech.

15:37.911 --> 15:40.425
I just needed your passcode
to boot it up.

15:40.513 --> 15:41.827
<i>Blathering Blatherskite.</i>

15:45.114 --> 15:47.117
Oh, this feels gross! Ugh!

15:47.204 --> 15:49.569
This is normal, right? Right?

15:49.657 --> 15:52.438
Did you drink more than one
of the serum vials?

15:52.532 --> 15:55.376
Yes, I told you I was bored!

16:01.781 --> 16:04.364
Yaah!

16:05.454 --> 16:09.697
Aaand <i> boom!</i>

16:10.053 --> 16:12.217
Bigger than Gizmoduck!

16:12.358 --> 16:15.395
It's Mega-Beaks!

16:15.483 --> 16:19.288
Oh, and you're all
incredibly dead.

16:19.818 --> 16:21.928
All right.

16:23.772 --> 16:27.527
Which huge muscle should I use
to destroy what first?

16:27.819 --> 16:29.608
You've always been a monster,

16:29.702 --> 16:32.117
but now you are
a <i> literal monster.</i>

16:37.204 --> 16:39.414
Huh?

16:40.704 --> 16:42.947
Mmm... Mm!

16:48.784 --> 16:51.697
Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah!

16:51.892 --> 16:53.885
Aaah!

16:54.290 --> 16:56.264
Wait, did I just eat
the pie tins?

17:01.364 --> 17:02.364
Huh!

17:07.864 --> 17:08.864
Aah!

17:12.284 --> 17:15.743
Aah! Yaah!
Yuck! Glazed donut!

17:28.654 --> 17:30.697
Whoa!

17:30.784 --> 17:32.567
Go. Find cover.

17:32.919 --> 17:36.628
This date is a disaster.
Fenton's gonna be crushed.

17:39.417 --> 17:41.947
Fenton's going to be crushed!

17:44.612 --> 17:47.235
Ha-ha-ha! Hi,<i> amigo.</i>

17:47.323 --> 17:48.697
Ehh!

17:53.156 --> 17:54.940
Bye, Beaksy.

18:02.065 --> 18:03.706
I'm sorry, Suit.

18:08.270 --> 18:11.063
I've got your kids!

18:11.151 --> 18:13.298
Maybe. I'm not sure
how this family works.

18:13.386 --> 18:16.026
But don't even think about
following me!

18:23.907 --> 18:25.202
Ugh! That idiot!

18:25.290 --> 18:26.608
So <i> I'm</i> the Suit?

18:26.696 --> 18:28.116
You're the one
working for Beaks!

18:28.204 --> 18:29.686
I work for myself.

18:29.774 --> 18:32.491
I just used him
for funding and resources.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.515
For what?
Was any of this real?

18:34.603 --> 18:35.759
What are you?

18:35.984 --> 18:38.837
A scientist!
Free of responsibility.

18:40.009 --> 18:42.277
And look,
for what it's worth...

18:43.039 --> 18:46.281
You're a good scientist.

18:46.371 --> 18:47.711
And you're a crook.

18:53.379 --> 18:54.542
Come on, come on, come on!

18:58.411 --> 19:01.292
OK,
you don't have the suit.

19:01.380 --> 19:04.137
What can <i> you</i> do?
Think, Fenton, think!

19:08.454 --> 19:13.364
#MakeltRain!

19:22.435 --> 19:24.808
How is this
a part of your plan?

19:24.896 --> 19:26.722
I wanted to up my visibility.

19:26.810 --> 19:30.003
You don't get more visible
than being a giant monster!

19:30.091 --> 19:33.443
You ruined Fenton's date!
Where is your heart, man?

19:33.615 --> 19:36.923
In here somewhere,
under all these righteous pecs!

19:37.011 --> 19:39.708
Pla-plow!

19:39.841 --> 19:41.255
Heh, huh... Ow!

19:41.343 --> 19:44.076
Ow. Who's doing that?!

19:44.301 --> 19:46.391
Call me <i> Fenton!</i>

19:54.099 --> 19:57.272
Wow. I never actually
caught a ball before.

19:57.392 --> 20:00.218
Well, who's the loser now,
<i>Coach Dad?!</i>

20:00.306 --> 20:02.559
Yaah!

20:02.877 --> 20:05.543
- Gandra?!
- Hurting puny, helpless heroes

20:05.631 --> 20:07.384
was not part of our deal,
Beaks.

20:07.471 --> 20:08.905
Gonna focus on the hero part.

20:13.582 --> 20:16.543
- Are you OK?
- I... I can't shock him anymore.

20:16.631 --> 20:18.544
His nanite-enhanced skin
is too tough!

20:18.632 --> 20:21.231
Yeah, but what matters
is inside. Under all that,

20:21.319 --> 20:24.424
he's still the same weak,
ego-fueled dweeb.

20:24.511 --> 20:27.594
Ugh, heroes.
Always with the morals.

20:27.681 --> 20:30.390
No, I mean inside, he's weak!

20:32.052 --> 20:34.210
You can stop, Beaks! Look!

20:34.747 --> 20:36.958
You're trending worldwide!

20:37.046 --> 20:38.819
I wanna see! I wanna see!

20:39.918 --> 20:42.128
Huh... huh?

20:43.693 --> 20:46.754
Aah! I can't use a phone.

20:46.955 --> 20:48.868
I can't use a phone!

20:48.971 --> 20:52.301
No-o-o-o!

20:59.131 --> 21:00.464
Huh?

21:00.551 --> 21:02.301
Uhh!

21:11.721 --> 21:14.094
- Yes! Wha...!
- Yahoo! Fenton did it!

21:14.181 --> 21:15.964
And without
the Gizmoduck armor!

21:16.051 --> 21:17.834
Webby, there is no Gizmoduck

21:17.921 --> 21:21.094
without the noble Fenton
underneath...

21:21.181 --> 21:22.834
I want to come down! Help!

21:22.921 --> 21:24.634
Oh, no, the kids!
Gandra, we gotta...

21:24.721 --> 21:26.181
Huh?

21:28.881 --> 21:31.825
Wait. She did it.

21:32.642 --> 21:35.169
Ready to come down anytime now!

21:37.301 --> 21:39.301
Stabilization up 53%!

21:41.131 --> 21:43.011
You. What do you think
you're doing here?

21:43.099 --> 21:45.927
Shouldn't you be
Gizmoducking around out there?

21:46.631 --> 21:48.924
Not today.
I'm needed here.

21:49.106 --> 21:50.895
Scientist at work.

21:54.971 --> 21:56.689
Hm. Wha...?!

21:56.777 --> 21:59.681
Wha...
What happened here?!
