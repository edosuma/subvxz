<i>In other news,
authorities are investigating...</i>

00:15.637 --> 00:18.868
<i>...a number of missing person reports
of a commercial cruise line employees.</i>

00:18.948 --> 00:21.845
<i>Authorities suspect that there may be
a link between the missing persons...</i>

00:21.945 --> 00:24.841
<i>...and the missing cruise ship,
The Neptune Star.</i>

00:24.921 --> 00:27.829
<i>The magnetic poles in the
surrounding area may be disrupting...</i>

00:27.909 --> 00:30.314
<i>...all conventional tracking systems.</i>

00:30.394 --> 00:33.016
<i>With no trace of visible
evidence or distress calls...</i>

00:33.096 --> 00:37.378
<i>...the authorization of search and
rescue team is still under debate.</i>

00:41.571 --> 00:43.577
No, no, no!

00:46.075 --> 00:48.155
Run, run!

00:50.614 --> 00:52.459
Run, run, run!

00:56.120 --> 00:57.597
Run!

00:59.289 --> 01:01.069
Keep going, keep going.

01:05.328 --> 01:06.874
Maggie!

01:09.033 --> 01:11.088
Keep going, keep going!

01:19.443 --> 01:21.288
It's James.

01:25.014 --> 01:27.043
We gotta get out of here.

01:32.689 --> 01:34.535
Somebody help me.

03:11.555 --> 03:13.433
What the hell?

03:15.659 --> 03:18.205
- Tom!
- Have you been here all night?

03:18.285 --> 03:22.599
Been here all morning. Technically,
after midnight it's called a.m.

03:22.679 --> 03:26.680
Actually, it's called not drinking
yourself into a dead stupor.

03:27.937 --> 03:29.759
Did you go out with that?

03:29.839 --> 03:33.497
Never go hunting without my knife.
Heh, heh, heh?

03:33.577 --> 03:35.832
Have you forgotten who taught ya how to hunt?

03:35.912 --> 03:39.323
That was a long time ago. Let's leave
hunting to the current professionals.

03:39.403 --> 03:41.605
Oh, is that what you're
calling yourself these days?

03:41.685 --> 03:44.541
- Come on, what's the problem?
- Oh, I don't know.

03:44.621 --> 03:49.379
Maybe we're shipping out in a few minutes,
and I'd like you not to throw up on our hosts.

03:49.459 --> 03:51.001
I'm fine.

03:51.595 --> 03:54.651
Please, for me. Clean up.

03:54.731 --> 03:58.072
You don't... smell sober.

03:59.235 --> 04:01.058
Make no promises.

04:07.143 --> 04:08.265
Think I smell good.

04:08.345 --> 04:12.268
<i>Hunter Rick Rainsford is definitely
trying to clean up his act...</i>

04:12.348 --> 04:15.905
<i>...after his name's been dragged
through the mud all over social media.</i>

04:15.985 --> 04:19.242
<i>He's got this new wildlife
preservation campaign.</i>

04:19.322 --> 04:22.979
<i>Kind of strange coming from a hunter,
but after repeated DUI charges...</i>

04:23.059 --> 04:25.284
<i>...numerous public drunkenness displays...</i>

04:25.364 --> 04:28.585
<i>...I think these acts of altruism
on behalf on Rainsford...</i>

04:28.665 --> 04:30.053
- Your boat?
- Yeah.

04:30.133 --> 04:31.997
It's a hell of a boat.

04:34.804 --> 04:36.906
<i>This is Captain...</i>

04:36.986 --> 04:41.297
<i>...Wilderness Explorer, now reminding
all personnel and passengers...</i>

04:41.377 --> 04:45.335
<i>...to please report to the starboard
side prior to boarding.</i>

04:45.415 --> 04:47.261
Watch your step.

04:48.505 --> 04:50.775
Captain, time is of the essence.

04:51.655 --> 04:54.344
What you're asking is impossible.

04:54.824 --> 04:57.481
We have to change course,
these waters are not safe.

04:57.561 --> 05:00.417
I did the research.
This is the quickest route.

05:00.897 --> 05:02.719
Tommy boy!

05:02.899 --> 05:04.488
- Rick.
- What's happening, Captain?

05:04.568 --> 05:07.857
This is Captain Andres,
he's in charge of this fine vessel.

05:07.937 --> 05:09.864
Any and all questions go to him.

05:09.944 --> 05:11.928
Actually, we're not finished yet.

05:12.008 --> 05:14.564
We have to respect is that you
and Mr. Rainsford...

05:14.644 --> 05:17.116
...are not the only passengers on this ship.

05:17.196 --> 05:19.886
I am responsible for the safety of everyone.

05:19.966 --> 05:21.711
All right.

05:22.936 --> 05:25.158
Let's... let's talk.

05:25.238 --> 05:28.328
No need to bore Rick with this nonsense.

05:29.208 --> 05:33.601
Thomas knows me so well. I don't like
to get bogged down with the details.

05:34.631 --> 05:36.510
Good talk.

05:52.566 --> 05:53.971
Need a little help.

05:55.134 --> 05:59.215
- How can I help you, sir?
- I'm in the market for some alcohol.

06:01.140 --> 06:03.509
I'm not allowed to give you any alcohol.

06:03.589 --> 06:06.288
- Excuse me?
- Well...

06:06.368 --> 06:07.844
...what I mean is...

06:07.924 --> 06:11.164
- I just mean that we don't have any.
- Come on, come on, come on!

06:11.244 --> 06:14.207
You don't have any?
Or you're not allowed to give me?

06:14.287 --> 06:16.032
Which is it?

06:16.122 --> 06:19.212
Oh... I think I heard the Captain.

06:19.292 --> 06:21.721
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes, Mr. Rainsford.

06:21.801 --> 06:24.838
Then you know this is a mistake.

06:25.398 --> 06:28.549
- I'm sorry.
- Not as sorry as you're gonna be.

07:07.506 --> 07:10.720
Sorry. Did I startle you?

07:13.730 --> 07:16.087
I was just trying to get a picture.

07:19.185 --> 07:21.174
I'm a celebrity.

07:21.254 --> 07:22.732
Darlin'.

07:23.807 --> 07:25.712
I'm no stranger to pictures...

07:25.792 --> 07:27.814
...but if you want a good one...

07:27.894 --> 07:30.116
...you should just ask.

07:30.196 --> 07:33.540
Well, I don't wanna bother you.
I know you're such a busy guy.

07:34.500 --> 07:39.358
Rick Rainsford is not
too busy for you, little lady.

07:39.438 --> 07:43.216
Okay, can I please take
your picture, Mr. Rainsford?

07:43.296 --> 07:47.775
Well, that's not fair. Now you know
my name and I don't know yours.

07:48.514 --> 07:50.504
Well, I'm...

07:50.584 --> 07:53.873
What's a beautiful sweetheart like you
doin' on a rusty old boat like this anyway?

07:53.953 --> 07:59.782
Oh, you know, just trying to get
a picture of our resident celebrity.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.916
- All right.
- Please.

08:02.996 --> 08:05.364
- I'll make it a good one.
- Oh, yeah?

08:05.444 --> 08:08.798
- Exclusive.
- Oh, I feel so special.

08:09.468 --> 08:11.347
Hold on.

08:18.745 --> 08:20.967
Yeah, oh, there it is.

08:21.407 --> 08:23.836
Oh, yes, perfect.

08:24.433 --> 08:25.992
How do I look?

08:26.072 --> 08:29.776
Pretty pompous and self-important,
so it's accurate if nothing else.

08:29.856 --> 08:31.107
What?

08:31.858 --> 08:35.672
Just saying it's a pretty
good portrait of Rick Rainsford.

08:37.063 --> 08:39.785
- Do we know each other?
- Yeah, we've met several times...

08:39.866 --> 08:43.456
...including earlier tonight. You were
probably just too drunk to remember.

08:43.535 --> 08:46.893
I meet a lot of people.
Sometimes I forget a few.

08:46.973 --> 08:49.028
You don't know anything about me.

08:49.108 --> 08:53.232
Oh, let's see here.
You hunt deer for sport, sort of...

08:53.312 --> 08:56.060
...although you're more well-known
for your famous love interest...

08:56.140 --> 09:01.190
...and stupid reality TV shows, because
you're so drunk you can barely even walk.

09:04.090 --> 09:07.446
So, yeah, I think I know
exactly who you are...

09:07.526 --> 09:09.338
...Mr. Rainsford.

09:11.197 --> 09:15.479
If I'm so terrible, why are you here
taking pictures of me?

09:19.672 --> 09:23.300
Clever. What you're looking for, right there.

09:24.077 --> 09:25.923
Knock yourself out.

09:26.813 --> 09:30.083
I'm famous. It's what a celebrity is.

09:30.163 --> 09:32.906
- That's really mature.
- I'm sorry, Ms. Christie.

09:32.986 --> 09:35.465
It's fine, it's fine.

09:43.797 --> 09:46.285
- Who was that?
- The girl?

09:46.365 --> 09:48.387
- Yeah.
- That's Anna Christie.

09:48.467 --> 09:51.057
She's the photographer management sent.

09:51.737 --> 09:54.527
- She's our photographer?
- Mm-hmm.

09:54.607 --> 09:58.966
When did that happen? What about... Santiago?

09:59.412 --> 10:01.935
You punched him in the face
last time, remember?

10:02.015 --> 10:04.304
He won't work with you anymore.

10:04.884 --> 10:06.774
Oh, yeah.

10:07.854 --> 10:10.500
She's young.

10:11.097 --> 10:13.700
- Yeah.
- And mean.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.304
Look...

10:15.694 --> 10:20.123
...are you gonna cooperate on this photo
shoot, or are we just wasting our time here?

10:20.834 --> 10:23.122
It's fine, I got it.

10:23.202 --> 10:27.115
I got it. She's just interesting, that's all.

10:27.807 --> 10:29.022
How so?

10:29.102 --> 10:32.031
I don't know,
she just better not piss me off.

10:32.111 --> 10:34.300
You keep your eye on the big game.

10:34.380 --> 10:36.187
I'll take care of the blondes.

10:38.151 --> 10:39.308
Okay.

10:41.054 --> 10:43.475
...is going on here?

10:44.908 --> 10:47.346
Calm down, man. It's a boat.

10:47.426 --> 10:49.248
It's gonna sway.

10:54.447 --> 10:57.875
<i>All personnel to the staff quarters.
All personnel to the staff quarters...</i>

10:57.955 --> 10:59.818
<i>...effective immediately.</i>

11:05.779 --> 11:08.127
Mr. Rainsford, the Captain's called
general quarters to the room.

11:08.207 --> 11:10.769
I know what general quarters means, useless.

11:10.899 --> 11:12.405
Everyone, back to your rooms.

11:12.485 --> 11:15.041
- Useless. That's your new name by the way.
- It means you have to...

11:15.121 --> 11:17.977
Get back to your room. Please, sir.

11:18.057 --> 11:22.321
- Found the alcohol. Useless.
- It's for your own safety. Please.

11:22.401 --> 11:25.012
- I'm goin', I'm goin'.
- <i>...there's been a security breach.</i>

11:25.092 --> 11:28.822
<i>The hull is taking on water.
Commence evacuations.</i>

11:28.902 --> 11:30.955
<i>Everyone to the life raft.</i>

11:34.173 --> 11:36.020
This way!

11:47.720 --> 11:50.178
Come on, everybody into the life boat.

11:52.158 --> 11:54.876
In the boat, in the boat, come on, everybody.

12:10.209 --> 12:12.710
No, no. I want you to get in the life boat.

13:15.875 --> 13:17.687
Are you serious?

13:17.977 --> 13:19.522
Rick.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.835
Do you have any more alcohol?

13:37.696 --> 13:41.046
Rick, come on, come on.
Thank you. Another bottle.

13:44.904 --> 13:47.794
Do you know this island?
Do you know where we are at all?

13:48.274 --> 13:51.388
- I'm gonna go look around.
- What? No, you're not.

13:54.747 --> 13:56.860
Hey, pretty good.

13:57.616 --> 14:00.666
- Were you a candy striper or somethin'?
- Are you still here?

14:00.746 --> 14:03.176
- I see someone.
- What?

14:03.356 --> 14:06.112
Hey. Hey! Over here.

14:13.299 --> 14:16.145
Hey, chief! Hey, bud!

14:17.803 --> 14:20.579
Hey, buddy, do you speak English?

14:20.939 --> 14:22.785
I'm Rick.

14:23.309 --> 14:25.164
Rick Rainsford.

14:25.444 --> 14:27.524
Down there, that's...

14:29.014 --> 14:30.569
Anna.

14:30.649 --> 14:31.828
Anna.

14:37.890 --> 14:39.633
Hey, buddy, what's your name?

14:40.793 --> 14:43.239
- What's your name, pal?
- Ivan.

14:45.898 --> 14:50.190
He's lost a lot of blood. Second degree
burns pretty much all over his body.

14:50.970 --> 14:53.516
He's bad, we must go.

14:55.341 --> 14:57.553
What? Go where?

14:58.276 --> 15:00.606
- Huh?
- Oh, yeah.

15:00.686 --> 15:03.261
- Wait, wait, wait.
- I got it.

15:21.200 --> 15:25.024
- Keep up, you're going to get lost.
- I am not going to get lost.

15:25.104 --> 15:28.026
- This is the wilderness, don't wander off.
- Oh, really, this is the wilderness?

15:28.106 --> 15:30.446
- Wow, how'd you figure that one out?
- Shh, you're disturbing Sammy.

15:30.526 --> 15:33.299
Stop. Trip wire.

15:33.379 --> 15:34.891
What?

15:36.082 --> 15:39.338
- Why is there a trip wire here?
- Dangerous animals.

15:39.718 --> 15:41.297
What?

15:43.055 --> 15:45.811
- Smart man.
- You're not helping.

15:45.891 --> 15:48.681
Where are we... hello, sir!

15:48.761 --> 15:50.139
Where...

15:52.798 --> 15:56.613
- Where are you talking us? Can't you just...
- Shh. We are here.

15:57.836 --> 15:59.416
Here?

16:08.080 --> 16:09.893
Get around there.

16:11.550 --> 16:13.597
When I tell you, okay.

16:14.720 --> 16:17.178
One, two, three.

16:25.431 --> 16:27.520
It's gonna be okay.
Do you have anything to sedate him?

16:27.600 --> 16:30.847
Painkillers, medication, anything?
What do you have?

16:32.305 --> 16:34.101
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

16:42.381 --> 16:44.238
How do you know how to do that?

16:45.418 --> 16:48.365
- Are you a doctor?
- No, he's not.

16:50.723 --> 16:54.571
But he's very experienced in field trauma.

16:55.561 --> 16:58.307
- Have you done this before?
- No.

16:59.832 --> 17:02.439
Well, then Ivan will instruct you.

17:03.369 --> 17:06.583
Please continue. If you'll excuse me.

17:12.244 --> 17:14.290
This is going to hurt.

17:15.214 --> 17:17.093
It's okay.

17:29.495 --> 17:31.340
Who are you?

17:31.830 --> 17:34.661
Excuse me. I'm Colonel Zaroff.

17:35.301 --> 17:38.691
- I don't think he'll make it.
- He'll be fine.

17:38.771 --> 17:40.593
Colonel?

17:40.673 --> 17:43.416
Yes. Retired.

17:44.343 --> 17:46.390
This is Ivan, you've met.

17:48.213 --> 17:51.637
- You two live here alone?
- Yes, we live on the island.

17:51.717 --> 17:54.340
Listen, we are here to assist you.

17:54.720 --> 17:56.465
Thank you.

17:57.356 --> 17:59.097
And you are?

17:59.758 --> 18:01.483
I'm Anna.

18:01.894 --> 18:03.518
That's Rick.

18:03.962 --> 18:05.520
Hello.

18:06.432 --> 18:09.521
- Hey.
- Hello, Rick.

18:11.270 --> 18:13.126
How do you feel?

18:13.506 --> 18:15.734
Not bad, I feel all right.

18:15.814 --> 18:17.863
Do you need any attention?

18:17.943 --> 18:19.667
I'm good.

18:21.179 --> 18:22.704
Thanks.

18:24.016 --> 18:25.571
Well, then...

18:25.651 --> 18:27.656
...let's let the healers heal.

18:27.736 --> 18:29.909
Let's go have a drink.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.480
How about you? You thirsty?

18:33.138 --> 18:36.812
We are men. She has proven
to be a worthy nurse.

18:38.697 --> 18:42.521
I'm fine. Go, go, I'm surprised
you lasted this long without a drink.

18:42.601 --> 18:46.742
- Happy to see your bad attitude's survived.
- Happy to see the laziness survived.

18:46.822 --> 18:50.018
- A lovers' quarrel?
- No, absolutely not.

18:50.188 --> 18:52.031
Definitely not.

18:52.361 --> 18:54.068
Let's go.

18:56.081 --> 18:58.537
Ivan, what's going on? What is this place?

19:12.331 --> 19:14.156
Very cute.

19:42.995 --> 19:45.273
I know it's a bit unorthodox...

19:47.400 --> 19:49.864
...but it's how I like to live my life.

19:51.103 --> 19:52.995
To each their own.

19:54.039 --> 19:56.530
So, tell me...

19:56.842 --> 19:59.067
...what happened out there?

19:59.912 --> 20:01.934
I wish I could tell you.

20:02.264 --> 20:04.105
It's all a blur to me.

20:11.857 --> 20:16.181
I imagine it must have been
a most painful experience.

20:16.261 --> 20:17.819
Yeah.

20:18.263 --> 20:20.481
Were you the only survivors?

20:22.501 --> 20:26.108
Yeah, I think so. I mean,
you saw what happened to that kid.

20:27.249 --> 20:29.259
A lot of good people were lost.

20:37.349 --> 20:38.906
Yes.

20:41.053 --> 20:43.345
I'm deeply sorry to hear that.

20:44.590 --> 20:47.824
- Thanks for takin' us in.
- It's not a problem...

20:48.520 --> 20:50.405
...at all.

20:54.733 --> 20:58.090
I'm sure you could imagine
we don't get too many guests.

20:58.170 --> 21:00.143
It's very...

21:00.223 --> 21:04.284
...nice to talk to someone new.

21:05.377 --> 21:07.166
I gathered.

21:07.546 --> 21:12.029
Of all the islands to wreck on, we had to
pick the one with nothin' but sand, trees...

21:12.109 --> 21:14.757
...and a hidden house where
two dudes live alone.

21:21.627 --> 21:23.516
What do you mean?

21:23.596 --> 21:26.486
I didn't mean anything, bro.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.022
- Bro.
- Yeah.

21:30.102 --> 21:32.392
Have another drink, Mr. Rainsford.

21:33.572 --> 21:36.623
- Take a seat.
- Don't mind if I do. Yes.

21:40.045 --> 21:42.901
- You hunt?
- I do.

21:42.981 --> 21:45.640
I find it exhilarating...

21:46.072 --> 21:48.240
...pleasurable hobby.

21:48.320 --> 21:51.624
Me too. I'm actually kind of a professional.

21:52.324 --> 21:55.149
You are a professional?

21:56.629 --> 21:58.954
Are you famous, Mr. Rainsford?

22:00.232 --> 22:03.790
In some circles, yeah,
I'm kind of a big deal.

22:04.803 --> 22:08.093
That girl Anna doesn't think so, though.
I'm no celebrity in her eyes.

22:08.173 --> 22:11.622
Don't be so modest, Mr. Rainsford.

22:12.210 --> 22:14.450
No one could ever accuse me of that.

22:15.380 --> 22:16.938
No.

22:25.591 --> 22:27.483
The Russian standard.

23:04.897 --> 23:06.498
You're really gentle.

23:10.035 --> 23:12.625
So, you live here with the Colonel?

23:12.705 --> 23:14.392
It is my home.

23:15.090 --> 23:17.356
Is there anybody else on this island?

23:19.211 --> 23:21.885
Why don't you wanna answer
any of my questions?

23:24.249 --> 23:25.638
Where's the bathroom?

23:43.201 --> 23:45.208
Man, what you have here...

23:45.288 --> 23:47.960
...I would kill for my own island.

23:48.040 --> 23:50.263
Hunt whenever I want to.

23:50.843 --> 23:52.500
Paradise.

23:53.345 --> 23:55.975
It's a good place to be if you are me.

23:56.815 --> 23:59.705
Why's that? Relivin' the glory days?

23:59.785 --> 24:01.306
What?

24:01.386 --> 24:04.577
You're obviously in the Russian military...

24:04.657 --> 24:06.948
...or somethin'.

24:08.226 --> 24:12.085
I've served everybody, served everywhere.

24:12.615 --> 24:15.448
Different country, different time.

24:15.668 --> 24:17.509
Different world.

24:18.370 --> 24:20.178
Sounds intriguing.

24:20.258 --> 24:22.130
It's a long story.

24:29.748 --> 24:32.004
You must leave the island quite frequently.

24:32.084 --> 24:34.439
I mean, you can't find
all these animals here.

24:34.619 --> 24:38.476
Well, I do. I mean, they ship them in.

24:38.556 --> 24:40.379
Shipped here?

24:40.959 --> 24:43.564
- Why?
- Why not?

24:43.644 --> 24:46.251
- To hunt them?
- Of course.

24:46.331 --> 24:50.123
Why not go hunt them in their natural
habitats? That's what a real hunter does.

24:56.809 --> 25:01.166
Are you suggesting I'm not
a real hunter, Mr. Rainsford?

25:01.596 --> 25:04.639
No, it's... it's just...

25:06.508 --> 25:08.302
Yeah, that is what I'm suggesting.

25:09.922 --> 25:11.479
Explain.

25:12.290 --> 25:16.629
You're cheating, you know. I mean, these
animals aren't in their native habitats.

25:16.709 --> 25:19.128
You always have the advantage.

25:19.798 --> 25:24.207
And it's an island. It's not a real hunt
if there's no chance they can get away.

25:24.287 --> 25:27.325
Well, I have no chance to get away.
They have no chance to get away.

25:27.405 --> 25:30.097
It seems fairly even to me.

25:30.876 --> 25:35.123
I think you should get off this island
and do some real hunting.

25:35.203 --> 25:36.929
Get back into the wilderness.

25:37.009 --> 25:41.038
I think this place might be
affecting your sensibilities

25:41.118 --> 25:42.569
...a little bit.

25:43.789 --> 25:46.622
Perhaps you are right, Mr. Rainsford.

26:14.186 --> 26:15.921
Are you going to be long?

26:16.601 --> 26:18.916
Give a girl a second. It's been a while.

27:26.658 --> 27:28.909
How do you get off this island?

27:29.694 --> 27:32.587
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

27:34.933 --> 27:36.589
...you gonna radio the mainland?

27:37.729 --> 27:39.651
Have us picked up?

27:42.307 --> 27:46.547
You have no home, no family
to get back to, Mr. Rainsford.

27:51.549 --> 27:54.609
- Says who?
- Says me.

27:55.320 --> 27:57.642
I know a lot about you.

27:57.722 --> 27:59.614
Yeah, well...

28:02.460 --> 28:05.338
...I wouldn't believe everything
you read in magazines.

28:06.398 --> 28:08.856
I'm gonna go check on Anna.

28:13.972 --> 28:17.782
I don't believe everything
I read in magazines.

28:38.580 --> 28:41.023
Mr. Rick Rainsford.

28:44.236 --> 28:46.928
The hunter, the man.

28:49.841 --> 28:51.967
I'm not interested in this man.

28:53.845 --> 28:56.271
I'm definitely more interested...

28:59.251 --> 29:01.108
...in this man.

29:11.063 --> 29:13.321
Love it, love it, I love it.

29:16.902 --> 29:19.892
Look at me and look into my eyes
and remember this face.

29:19.972 --> 29:22.600
I want you to remember this, okay?

29:26.011 --> 29:29.505
Well... well, hello, Ms. Richards.

29:30.015 --> 29:32.050
What did you call me?

29:35.120 --> 29:38.977
I called you by your real name, Ms. Richards.

29:39.457 --> 29:41.773
Here on the island...

29:41.853 --> 29:44.713
...we go as who we are...

29:45.263 --> 29:47.569
...not who we want to be.

29:47.649 --> 29:51.523
- You brought us here.
- No, no, I brought Rick here.

29:51.603 --> 29:54.229
You were not meant to survive.

30:00.178 --> 30:03.804
But, as I'm sure Ivan will agree...

30:04.399 --> 30:07.025
...you're a pleasurable accident.

30:08.253 --> 30:09.727
<i>Da.</i>

30:09.807 --> 30:11.944
You killed all those people.

30:12.714 --> 30:14.516
Collateral damage.

30:16.061 --> 30:17.470
What did you do to him?

30:18.630 --> 30:20.969
Rick, he loves his vodka.

30:21.049 --> 30:23.892
He'll be out for a little while.

30:36.981 --> 30:39.404
Fast and resourceful, huh?

30:39.484 --> 30:44.109
Yes. You know, this is the most
awkward part of the game.

30:44.189 --> 30:46.284
But, in my experience...

30:46.364 --> 30:49.311
...I find there is no better way, so...

30:49.391 --> 30:51.085
...here we are.

30:51.897 --> 30:54.556
It is important for you to listen.

30:54.866 --> 30:57.759
He'll be brief. Huh?

31:01.939 --> 31:04.398
She likes to fight, huh?

31:09.947 --> 31:11.423
It's okay.

31:11.503 --> 31:15.388
I don't like to use guns, so I apologize.

31:16.421 --> 31:18.886
I try to be a little more...

31:18.966 --> 31:21.932
Creative, Ivan.

31:24.062 --> 31:25.443
<i>Da.</i>

31:25.523 --> 31:27.385
Creative with what?

31:27.765 --> 31:29.360
The game.

31:33.738 --> 31:36.548
I understand that you must be thinking...

31:37.278 --> 31:39.329
...who are we...

31:39.711 --> 31:42.941
...where are you.
You are in a game of life...

31:47.352 --> 31:49.310
...and death.

31:49.391 --> 31:51.560
This is not a place to...

31:51.640 --> 31:53.478
...be something that you're not...

31:53.558 --> 31:57.018
...but to be who you really are
inside your heart...

31:59.331 --> 32:01.222
...Mr. Rainsford.

32:03.501 --> 32:06.554
So, like they say, the...

32:07.377 --> 32:11.983
...American adage,
"the strongest will survive."

32:14.212 --> 32:16.070
It's just a game.

32:17.782 --> 32:20.407
- Your world...
- My world is...

32:21.686 --> 32:22.844
...honest...

32:25.457 --> 32:27.014
...simple.

32:29.027 --> 32:31.307
And you shall make...

32:31.387 --> 32:34.636
...a very good hunt, huh?

32:35.400 --> 32:36.958
Absolutely.

32:37.469 --> 32:39.618
I brought Rick here because...

32:39.698 --> 32:42.559
...he is a ultimate hunter.

32:44.442 --> 32:46.682
He will be...

32:46.762 --> 32:49.787
...my greatest conquest.

32:50.782 --> 32:53.072
Now, listen to me carefully.

32:53.852 --> 32:55.507
There's a boat.

32:55.587 --> 32:59.413
Do you hear me, Mr. Rainsford? There's
a boat on the other side of the island.

33:00.993 --> 33:04.418
If you get there, you live.

33:05.547 --> 33:07.439
If you can kill me...

33:08.233 --> 33:10.323
...it would be much easier.

33:10.903 --> 33:12.675
And what if we refuse to play?

33:14.897 --> 33:17.739
Then I will have to start on your feet.

33:20.778 --> 33:22.605
Why the long face?

33:23.415 --> 33:25.651
I'm giving you a chance to survive.

33:26.051 --> 33:28.911
I just want to play a simple game.

33:30.555 --> 33:32.814
You might just find it fun.

33:35.427 --> 33:36.995
Get him up.

33:55.307 --> 33:57.339
Take the supplies.

34:04.489 --> 34:07.623
Come on, come on. Rick, come on. Come on.

34:10.495 --> 34:13.985
<i>This just in, a private charter ship
called The Wilderness Explorer...</i>

34:14.065 --> 34:17.255
<i>...has gone missing. Officials say
a distress call was put out Monday...</i>

34:17.335 --> 34:20.058
<i>...at 2:24 a.m. in the north Pacific Ocean.</i>

34:20.138 --> 34:24.228
<i>The U.S. government is making expedited
actions to find the cruise ship.</i>

34:24.309 --> 34:29.367
<i>Among its many passengers was celebrity
hunter and philanthropist, Rick Rainsford.</i>

34:29.447 --> 34:31.746
<i>Adventure Cruises has made
an official statement...</i>

34:31.827 --> 34:34.815
<i>...saying that they will be working
quickly with authorities...</i>

34:34.895 --> 34:36.911
<i>...to locate the missing ship.</i>

34:51.813 --> 34:53.695
Let the game begin.

35:04.149 --> 35:07.392
- Rick, are you okay?
- Yeah.

35:19.297 --> 35:22.156
- What?
- No, stay.

35:24.102 --> 35:25.559
Oh, gee.

35:28.330 --> 35:31.219
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

35:33.861 --> 35:35.423
Are you okay?

35:35.503 --> 35:38.854
This is not happening.
This is not real, I'm just in a nightmare.

35:38.934 --> 35:41.956
I'm having a nightmare.
This isn't real, just bad dreams.

35:42.036 --> 35:44.862
It's not real, it's not real.

35:47.609 --> 35:48.563
What are you doing?

35:48.643 --> 35:50.865
I don't know, it's what people do
when people freak out.

35:50.945 --> 35:53.628
I think it might calm you down
or turn you on.

35:53.708 --> 35:55.551
That's a terrible idea.

35:56.918 --> 35:58.488
Ugh.

36:00.522 --> 36:02.506
You calmed down, didn't ya?

36:29.384 --> 36:31.476
Mother nature, bless me...

36:33.305 --> 36:36.796
...with courage, truth...

36:37.425 --> 36:39.250
...and humility.

36:40.495 --> 36:42.554
Mother nature, bless me...

36:43.631 --> 36:47.323
...with your heart and land.

36:48.570 --> 36:50.628
Mother nature, bless me...

36:51.789 --> 36:55.480
...for who I am!

37:05.820 --> 37:07.542
Where are you goin'?

37:07.622 --> 37:09.681
You don't know anybody else here.

37:32.146 --> 37:33.604
Rick!

37:34.015 --> 37:35.372
Rick!

37:50.732 --> 37:52.789
Ow, ow, ow.

37:56.804 --> 37:58.362
Ah.

38:01.375 --> 38:02.886
Thanks.

38:07.482 --> 38:09.771
That bastard must've booby-trapped the woods.

38:09.851 --> 38:11.709
Yeah, it looks that way.

38:18.426 --> 38:21.522
- You all right?
- It looks worse than it is.

38:22.830 --> 38:24.288
Ow.

38:37.545 --> 38:40.367
- We need to get to the beach.
- No, we need to get to some spring water...

38:40.447 --> 38:43.805
...and find a place to rest. Without hydration
and sleep, we're not going anywhere.

38:43.885 --> 38:46.741
- That's a waste of time.
- No, it's not, we are in the wild.

38:46.821 --> 38:49.276
Water should be our number one priority.

38:49.356 --> 38:50.962
You want water?

38:52.359 --> 38:54.172
Here's water.

38:54.252 --> 38:57.562
I think we're probably gonna need
a little bit more than that, don't you think?

38:57.642 --> 39:02.350
Come on. We're on an island.
There's gotta be water close by. Somewhere.

39:02.430 --> 39:05.927
And you know so much about wilderness
survival because you photograph ducks?

39:06.007 --> 39:07.695
Yeah. That's exactly what I do.

39:07.775 --> 39:10.197
- You know so much about me.
- What's with the fake name?

39:10.277 --> 39:11.835
What?

39:13.247 --> 39:14.602
What fake name?

39:14.682 --> 39:17.171
The name that you go by
that's not your real name.

39:19.322 --> 39:21.543
What? Rick?

39:21.623 --> 39:25.082
Rick, stay with me. Are you serious? Rick.

39:53.455 --> 39:55.262
Will he live?

39:57.128 --> 39:58.880
I'll keep him alive.

39:58.960 --> 40:01.072
They won't leave without him.

40:01.152 --> 40:04.021
- We should embrace change.
- <i>Da.</i>

40:05.066 --> 40:07.455
Change is important.

40:07.535 --> 40:09.572
- <i>Da?</i>
- <i>Da.</i>

40:09.871 --> 40:12.303
Makes us wiser...

40:13.341 --> 40:15.184
...and stronger.

40:15.643 --> 40:18.653
And less vulnerable. <i>Da?</i>

40:19.013 --> 40:20.537
<i>Da.</i>

40:21.749 --> 40:24.008
I am concerned with these two.

40:27.221 --> 40:29.246
Is this your concern?

40:32.660 --> 40:34.702
Is this your concern?

41:20.542 --> 41:22.113
Seriously, really?

41:53.574 --> 41:55.131
No.

41:57.879 --> 41:59.136
No.

42:09.256 --> 42:10.814
Anna.

42:17.665 --> 42:19.687
Sector 23 all clear.

42:19.767 --> 42:22.223
- <i>I have eyes on Anna.</i>
- Copy.

42:22.303 --> 42:24.225
<i>The radio's silent.</i>

42:24.305 --> 42:25.862
Copy.

42:32.847 --> 42:34.205
Rick.

42:37.919 --> 42:38.976
Rick.

42:41.656 --> 42:43.246
Rick.

42:43.591 --> 42:45.878
He's here, run. Go, go, go.

43:12.086 --> 43:13.644
Rick.

43:14.589 --> 43:16.146
Rick.

43:16.791 --> 43:19.015
Rick, Rick.

43:21.595 --> 43:23.153
Rick.

43:29.140 --> 43:31.027
Oh, God.

43:34.876 --> 43:37.331
Rick, where are you? Rick?

43:37.411 --> 43:39.903
- Anna, I'm over here.
- Where?

43:41.816 --> 43:43.373
Anna.

43:44.285 --> 43:45.642
Hi.

43:46.680 --> 43:50.211
Quicksand. Where the hell did this come from?

43:50.291 --> 43:52.813
Careful, careful,
I'm not sure where it starts or ends.

43:52.893 --> 43:54.849
I got it, I got it.
You gotta calm down, okay.

43:54.929 --> 43:56.217
- I'm calm.
- You gotta relax.

43:56.297 --> 43:58.365
I'm relaxed, I'm relaxed.

43:58.445 --> 44:01.455
- I'm gonna get you out, okay? Trust me.
- Okay. Okay.

44:01.535 --> 44:04.091
- Now, close your eyes.
- How is that gonna help?

44:04.171 --> 44:08.235
'Cause I don't want you starin' at me.
Just close 'em, close your eyes. All right?

44:08.315 --> 44:10.364
- Okay.
- Take a deep breath.

44:10.444 --> 44:12.934
Lift your arms above your head.
There you go, okay.

44:13.014 --> 44:16.143
I'm sinking. Pull me out.

44:16.223 --> 44:20.041
I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to.
Stop, calm down. All right?

44:20.121 --> 44:24.011
You wanna... jump in and do
a synchronized quicksand dance with me?

44:24.091 --> 44:27.962
- No, aim towards me.
- Towards you? Into the quicksand.

44:28.042 --> 44:29.784
Okay, three.

44:29.864 --> 44:32.787
You're gonna pull out.
Be calm, and I'm gonna let go.

44:32.867 --> 44:35.289
I'll get you out side to side, okay?

44:35.369 --> 44:37.324
Pull, pull, pull!

44:37.404 --> 44:39.125
I'm pushing.

44:46.213 --> 44:48.071
Get off of me!

44:50.451 --> 44:52.206
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

44:52.286 --> 44:54.050
- Come on, we gotta keep movin'.
- We can't.

44:54.130 --> 44:58.079
- Ivan's still close by.
- No, there's gonna be more of these traps.

44:58.159 --> 45:00.347
We're barely surviving 'em.

45:00.427 --> 45:02.519
Come on, I've got something to show you.

45:07.902 --> 45:10.141
- Give me just a sec.
- We don't have a second, come on.

45:10.221 --> 45:12.159
- I just almost died.
- I know you did, but we gotta go...

45:12.239 --> 45:15.496
- ...he's close. Come on!
- Can you stop talking, please?

45:15.576 --> 45:17.064
- No, I can't.
- I'll come, just shut up.

45:17.144 --> 45:20.027
- I'm just saving your life.
- Shut up and I'll follow, come on.

45:20.107 --> 45:21.702
Don't tell me to shut up.

45:21.782 --> 45:24.038
- Quit talking.
- Come on.

45:33.895 --> 45:36.450
- See?
- You marked them all.

45:36.530 --> 45:39.867
Yep. Well, all the ones I could find.
It was dark.

45:39.947 --> 45:42.852
- Were there other guns?
- No, just more stuff like this.

45:42.932 --> 45:46.098
- Some arrows, a grenade.
- A grenade?

45:46.178 --> 45:49.833
- Yeah, I couldn't dismantle it either.
- I could.

45:51.812 --> 45:54.036
What, how?

45:54.848 --> 45:56.721
I was in the military.

45:57.051 --> 45:58.942
You were? When?

45:59.686 --> 46:02.863
- Long time ago.
- Where'd you serve?

46:02.943 --> 46:05.066
- I didn't.
- But you said you were in the...

46:05.146 --> 46:07.214
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Why not?

46:07.294 --> 46:09.175
What's your real last name?

46:15.636 --> 46:17.461
Take a mile this way.

46:18.806 --> 46:20.782
That's what I thought.

46:22.676 --> 46:24.568
And here we go.

46:53.507 --> 46:56.472
First you won't shut up,
and now the silent treatment?

46:59.914 --> 47:02.036
You're really not gonna tell me?

47:03.951 --> 47:05.508
Whoa!

47:05.628 --> 47:06.659
Go.

48:33.173 --> 48:35.266
Hey, I found a creek.

48:36.377 --> 48:38.232
Come on. Really?

48:38.312 --> 48:41.202
What? You didn't find the rabbit already?

48:41.302 --> 48:43.771
Maybe if weren't stomping around
the forest, they would have.

48:43.881 --> 48:45.726
I am not stomping around the forest.

48:45.806 --> 48:48.692
The rabbit heart you stomping, and ran away.

48:48.772 --> 48:53.197
Oh, my God, the great Rick Rainsford
can't hunt a rabbit. A little rabbit.

48:53.277 --> 48:55.332
Could we not fight for like two minutes?

48:55.412 --> 48:57.934
Could you give me two minutes
without making any noise?

48:58.014 --> 48:59.335
Two minutes?

48:59.415 --> 49:01.827
- Please.
- I can't wait to see this. Go.

49:18.169 --> 49:22.199
- What the...
- Yeah. Still got it, Rick.

49:24.341 --> 49:27.304
- Not so bad of a hunter after all.
- That was not funny.

49:27.384 --> 49:29.883
You know what's really strange?

49:29.963 --> 49:31.789
I just don't agree with you.

49:46.947 --> 49:48.945
I found some more dry wood.

49:58.159 --> 49:59.980
Let me help.

50:00.060 --> 50:02.125
No, thanks. I've got this.

50:08.068 --> 50:12.148
- You know, I actually have something...
- I said I got this. Okay?

50:37.364 --> 50:39.184
Not everything has to be a fight.

50:54.014 --> 50:57.047
- I had it, you know.
- Oh, I know.

51:18.205 --> 51:20.994
- How is it?
- Mm.

51:21.074 --> 51:22.899
Rather have a hamburger.

51:26.046 --> 51:27.603
Agreed.

51:29.650 --> 51:31.907
So, do you always eat what you hunt?

51:33.587 --> 51:35.542
It depends.

51:35.622 --> 51:38.549
No family to bring home
60 pounds of venison to.

51:38.859 --> 51:40.914
I donate it sometimes.

51:41.194 --> 51:45.074
- Really? You donate?
- Yeah. Good PR, you know.

51:46.266 --> 51:49.156
Wow, staged altruism.
Why am I not at all surprised?

51:49.236 --> 51:51.174
It isn't like that.

51:52.588 --> 51:54.431
I guess it is a little weird.

51:56.743 --> 52:00.087
One time there was a stylist on set
combing the fur of a buck I just shot.

52:00.167 --> 52:02.403
- No way.
- Seriously.

52:03.083 --> 52:04.941
That is ridiculous.

52:07.844 --> 52:10.058
Maybe I did let it all get away from me.

52:11.097 --> 52:12.914
That's the problem with fame.

52:14.194 --> 52:17.645
Famous people don't have anyone in their
life to just be honest with them, you know.

52:18.332 --> 52:21.605
No. Thomas is always honest with me.

52:21.685 --> 52:23.757
- Really?
- Yeah.

52:23.837 --> 52:25.992
Does he tell you that you
come off like a pompous jerk?

52:26.072 --> 52:27.630
Everyday.

52:29.510 --> 52:31.401
We're like brothers.

52:46.193 --> 52:48.282
Okay, spill it.

52:48.362 --> 52:49.846
Spill what?

52:50.864 --> 52:52.722
The fire.

52:53.734 --> 52:55.329
Did you learn that in girl scouts?

52:56.369 --> 52:58.659
Really? Girl scouts?

52:58.739 --> 53:02.506
What's wrong with girl scouts? I would
kill for a box of Thin Mints right now.

53:02.976 --> 53:07.201
No. I... did not have
any time for girl scouts.

53:08.048 --> 53:11.741
No merit badges or Thin Mints.

53:14.054 --> 53:15.878
No boyfriends.

53:16.890 --> 53:19.348
Or proms.

53:20.260 --> 53:22.319
Or anything for that matter.

53:23.764 --> 53:25.853
I can thank my Mom for that.

53:26.733 --> 53:30.948
- She's a journalist. Andrea Richards.
- Yeah, I've heard of her.

53:32.406 --> 53:33.948
I didn't know she had a daughter.

53:37.944 --> 53:40.764
Yeah, no, she doesn't really.

53:42.215 --> 53:43.717
What do you mean?

53:47.601 --> 53:50.894
Wasn't really around enough
to be an actual mom, you know.

53:53.193 --> 53:55.596
I was just kind of always there...

53:56.296 --> 53:59.687
...while she drug me around
on her stupid assignments.

54:01.267 --> 54:03.326
She didn't care at all.

54:06.940 --> 54:10.397
When I was eight years old
I knew more about cameras...

54:10.477 --> 54:14.173
...and lenses than I did Barbies or...

54:14.553 --> 54:16.412
...I don't know, tea parties.

54:18.451 --> 54:21.808
You seem like the kind of kid that would've
been more into playing with G.I. Joes...

54:21.888 --> 54:23.780
...than Barbie, anyway.

54:25.826 --> 54:28.478
- Maybe.
- Definitely.

54:28.858 --> 54:30.705
You haven't lived until...

54:30.785 --> 54:34.186
...you are on the Andes...

54:34.535 --> 54:36.222
...on your birthday...

54:36.302 --> 54:39.315
...held up in a cave with an injured guide.

54:40.106 --> 54:42.463
My birthday present that year...

54:42.543 --> 54:44.188
...learned how to build a fire.

54:44.678 --> 54:46.302
That sucks.

54:51.518 --> 54:53.575
I'm sorry, this is weird.

54:57.391 --> 55:01.482
I just tried so hard to get out of her shadow,
you know, and changed my last name.

55:01.562 --> 55:03.851
Tried to change my profession, but...

55:04.431 --> 55:06.553
...then I realized I'm just...

55:06.633 --> 55:10.126
...I don't know, this is the only thing
I'm actually good at, so...

55:12.806 --> 55:14.358
So...

55:15.290 --> 55:17.199
...you went with Anna Christie.

55:18.445 --> 55:20.267
Anna Christie.

55:20.647 --> 55:22.538
Why Christie?

55:23.649 --> 55:25.541
I don't know.

55:26.019 --> 55:29.910
You could've picked any name in the world.
I would've picked something more interesting.

55:29.990 --> 55:32.629
- Thanks.
- Anna...

55:33.909 --> 55:35.501
...Kinkade.

55:36.763 --> 55:39.654
- That literally makes no sense.
- The master of light.

55:40.634 --> 55:42.789
Yes, but he was a painter,
not a photographer.

55:42.869 --> 55:44.825
- It still... it kind of makes sense.
- No, it doesn't.

55:44.905 --> 55:47.661
- The master of light, of photography.
- You're so proud of yourself.

55:47.741 --> 55:51.199
I was proud of myself until you said
it didn't make any sense.

55:52.429 --> 55:55.385
- I'm tryin'.
- Yes, you are.

55:56.850 --> 55:59.507
This was supposed to be
my big break, you know.

56:00.587 --> 56:02.676
Photographing you.

56:02.756 --> 56:04.214
Yikes.

56:04.858 --> 56:07.081
Photography is supposed to be about...

56:07.911 --> 56:09.468
...capturing...

56:10.273 --> 56:11.952
...that rare...

56:12.032 --> 56:14.254
...honest and truthful moment...

56:14.793 --> 56:16.122
...in someone, you know.

56:16.202 --> 56:20.245
I take this assignment
that's just basically a glamor shot.

56:21.508 --> 56:23.333
No offense.

56:24.645 --> 56:26.486
None taken.

56:27.714 --> 56:30.874
My mom would be so proud of me.

56:32.853 --> 56:34.444
Well...

56:34.967 --> 56:37.791
...I'm gonna do whatever it takes
to get you off this island.

56:43.263 --> 56:44.547
Deal?

56:45.799 --> 56:47.357
Deal.

56:57.243 --> 56:59.303
We should try to get some sleep.

57:41.354 --> 57:44.310
<i>News on The Wilderness Explorer
and The Neptune Star.</i>

57:44.390 --> 57:46.270
<i>The wreckage has been found...</i>

57:46.350 --> 57:49.515
<i>...an Anchorage based fishing company
reports that one of their fishing vessels...</i>

57:49.595 --> 57:53.142
<i>...has uncovered pieces of the missing

<i>While most of the ships'

<i>...that there may in fact still

58:07.080 --> 58:11.737
<i>Among those not identified at the scene

59:24.925 --> 59:26.782
Get up.

59:28.294 --> 59:29.852
Hey.

59:30.270 --> 59:31.854
Comrade.

59:49.816 --> 59:51.474
Get out of here.

01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:39.428
Rick, are you okay?

01:00:40.760 --> 01:00:42.625
I would've had him.

01:00:43.169 --> 01:00:45.188
Come on. Let's go.

01:00:45.268 --> 01:00:48.028
No. He's gonna die.

01:00:48.108 --> 01:00:50.200
I doubt it. Come on.

01:00:55.882 --> 01:00:57.940
Ivan's not doing well.

01:00:59.252 --> 01:01:01.101
You better hurry.

01:01:52.272 --> 01:01:54.059
Zaroff.

01:02:13.731 --> 01:02:16.583
Let's go. Come on, idiot.

01:02:16.863 --> 01:02:18.420
Get.

01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:27.694
Damn it, Rick, you could have
ended this entire thing.

01:02:30.310 --> 01:02:32.698
You don't attack a man from behind.

01:02:32.778 --> 01:02:36.136
- It's not sportsman like.
- Now is the time to get off this island.

01:02:36.216 --> 01:02:38.222
So, we just leave Sammy?

01:02:41.487 --> 01:02:43.910
He's gonna busy tending to Ivan.

01:02:44.590 --> 01:02:47.340
Rick. Rick, I've stepped on something.

01:02:51.664 --> 01:02:53.139
It's a landmine.

01:02:56.336 --> 01:02:59.159
I... I scoped the entire area.
I didn't think about landmines.

01:02:59.239 --> 01:03:02.627
- Don't move.
- Okay, canceling all plans to move now.

01:03:02.707 --> 01:03:05.465
I've never seen a mine like this.
It's not standard issue.

01:03:05.545 --> 01:03:07.800
Oh, great, now you finally admit
that you don't know everything.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:11.051
- It might be sound activated.
- What are you doing?

01:03:12.852 --> 01:03:14.409
Thinking.

01:03:15.121 --> 01:03:18.611
Can you please go think far away over there?
If it explodes it shouldn't kill both of us.

01:03:18.691 --> 01:03:21.341
- I'm gonna figure this out.
- No, Rick, go.

01:03:21.421 --> 01:03:24.424
- You're gonna be okay.
- Rick, go, get out of here.

01:03:26.466 --> 01:03:28.324
I'm not leaving you.

01:03:31.604 --> 01:03:35.562
I'm sorry, okay. I am so sorry,
but you have to go. Go.

01:03:35.642 --> 01:03:38.198
Get away from me. Go!

01:03:38.278 --> 01:03:39.515
Go.

01:03:47.620 --> 01:03:50.208
- Tell me a story.
- What?

01:03:50.288 --> 01:03:52.885
Seriously, tell me a story.

01:03:52.965 --> 01:03:54.972
- What? What kind of story?
- Anything.

01:03:55.052 --> 01:03:57.062
- I'm standing on a landmine here.
- That's not the point.

01:03:57.142 --> 01:03:59.752
- What is the point then?
- Shut up and tell me a story.

01:03:59.832 --> 01:04:02.760
I can't shut up and tell you
a story at the same time.

01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:06.128
Okay.

01:04:06.472 --> 01:04:10.363
Okay. I wasn't always like this, you know.

01:04:10.743 --> 01:04:13.033
I've been hunting for a while,
I've been hunting forever.

01:04:13.113 --> 01:04:16.550
- Rick, what are you doing?
- I'm telling you a story.

01:04:17.550 --> 01:04:19.842
Okay, make it a good one.

01:04:21.061 --> 01:04:23.109
My dad taught me how to hunt.

01:04:23.189 --> 01:04:25.245
It was just him and me.

01:04:25.325 --> 01:04:27.150
It's how we bonded.

01:04:28.728 --> 01:04:31.751
And he never even talked to me,
except for when we were hunting.

01:04:31.831 --> 01:04:36.589
When I was 16, we were hunting
out in the woods by my home town.

01:04:36.669 --> 01:04:39.625
It wasn't sanctioned hunting property,
and we weren't following the rules.

01:04:39.705 --> 01:04:41.888
We were just havin' fun.

01:04:41.968 --> 01:04:44.431
I'd just shot my first buck.

01:04:45.111 --> 01:04:48.003
It was clean. Perfect shot.

01:04:48.781 --> 01:04:50.787
<i>My dad was so proud of me.</i>

01:04:51.217 --> 01:04:55.286
And we walked up to the animal,
and he was talking to me...

01:04:55.755 --> 01:04:59.379
...about something. I don't know,
I can't remember, my dad was talking to me.

01:04:59.459 --> 01:05:01.682
And then we saw another deer up ahead.

01:05:02.262 --> 01:05:04.226
He stood up...

01:05:05.065 --> 01:05:08.973
...and then came falling down.

01:05:15.942 --> 01:05:19.365
- What happened?
- He was shot by a rookie.

01:05:20.713 --> 01:05:21.934
Dad!

01:05:22.014 --> 01:05:23.906
There are rules.

01:05:24.617 --> 01:05:26.439
You're not supposed to hunt
in certain areas...

01:05:26.519 --> 01:05:28.957
...you're not supposed to wear
certain types of clothes...

01:05:29.037 --> 01:05:31.914
...but we weren't following 'em. He was 15.

01:05:35.929 --> 01:05:38.622
He stood up at the exact wrong time.

01:05:42.028 --> 01:05:43.859
It was an accident.

01:05:46.039 --> 01:05:49.534
Rick, I don't understand
why you're telling me this.

01:05:59.552 --> 01:06:00.974
Nothing happened.

01:06:02.122 --> 01:06:04.885
- Oh, we're alive.
- Yeah.

01:06:05.925 --> 01:06:07.847
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, are you?

01:06:07.927 --> 01:06:10.152
- Yeah.
- Oh.

01:06:11.831 --> 01:06:13.288
Hey.

01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.822
Are you okay?

01:06:16.902 --> 01:06:18.460
Yeah.

01:06:18.804 --> 01:06:20.696
I can't believe...

01:06:31.217 --> 01:06:33.105
You ready?

01:06:50.736 --> 01:06:52.758
- You got it?
- Thank you.

01:06:52.838 --> 01:06:54.595
We're out winning them now.

01:07:01.161 --> 01:07:02.985
Zaroff's been busy.

01:07:04.150 --> 01:07:06.008
Come on.

01:07:28.241 --> 01:07:31.264
Oh, God. Never really thought it was...

01:07:31.344 --> 01:07:34.770
- We are never getting out of here.
- Hey, my bag.

01:07:38.501 --> 01:07:42.543
If you pull out a bottle of booze, I swear I'm
going to hit you over the head with a rock.

01:07:43.323 --> 01:07:45.180
I'm not kidding.

01:07:46.459 --> 01:07:49.882
50/50 shot there's still some booze
in there. If you really wanna hit me.

01:07:59.505 --> 01:08:01.438
<i>Mr. Rainsford...</i>

01:08:01.518 --> 01:08:03.588
<i>...I know you were on that rig.</i>

01:08:04.144 --> 01:08:05.698
<i>Indulge me.</i>

01:08:05.778 --> 01:08:08.468
- How's Ivan?
- <i>Fine.</i>

01:08:08.548 --> 01:08:13.043
<i>A scratch or two.
But thank you for your concern.</i>

01:08:13.753 --> 01:08:16.809
Some hunter you turned out to be. Traps?

01:08:16.889 --> 01:08:18.877
Real sportsman like.

01:08:18.957 --> 01:08:21.046
- <i>Hey, Rick.</i>
- Yeah?

01:08:21.127 --> 01:08:23.015
<i>How is the quail?</i>

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:29.109
<i>Anna.</i>

01:08:29.669 --> 01:08:31.991
- What?
- <i>Thank God.</i>

01:08:32.071 --> 01:08:35.828
<i>The thought of your skin
spread all over the trees...</i>

01:08:35.908 --> 01:08:39.499
- <i>...would have kept me up all night.</i>
- I am not afraid of you.

01:08:39.578 --> 01:08:42.535
<i>No need to be afraid of me, my dear...</i>

01:08:42.615 --> 01:08:46.572
<i>...but there is a lot of jungle
between the beach and me.</i>

01:08:46.652 --> 01:08:49.309
<i>Ivan has left his toys all over.</i>

01:08:49.389 --> 01:08:51.977
<i>Try not to step in any of them.</i>

01:08:52.057 --> 01:08:55.180
<i>You'll be seeing me sooner than you think.</i>

01:08:55.261 --> 01:08:57.046
About damn time.

01:08:59.465 --> 01:09:02.374
- How did he know that?
- He's tracking us. Find your bag...

01:09:02.453 --> 01:09:04.957
...change your clothes, then we gotta
get rid of everything he gave us.

01:09:05.037 --> 01:09:07.536
- Yeah.
- Backpack.

01:09:22.888 --> 01:09:24.979
Excuse me, can you...

01:09:32.598 --> 01:09:34.800
You're gonna need to change that too.

01:09:36.535 --> 01:09:39.359
- My bra?
- You can never be too cautious.

01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:41.897
Typical.

01:09:55.888 --> 01:09:58.745
Do you think we've been
on this island too long?

01:09:59.625 --> 01:10:01.183
<i>Da.</i>

01:10:04.129 --> 01:10:06.570
We had a code when we started.

01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:10.259
No women, no children.

01:10:10.803 --> 01:10:13.629
Children? Who kills children?

01:10:16.342 --> 01:10:18.149
This is getting good.

01:10:19.745 --> 01:10:21.948
Why don't we just let them go?

01:10:24.507 --> 01:10:26.409
Let them go? Let me see.

01:10:36.429 --> 01:10:38.251
You seem a little...

01:10:39.719 --> 01:10:41.412
...tense.

01:10:42.234 --> 01:10:44.645
This is not going to end well.

01:10:45.405 --> 01:10:47.632
Are you interested in the girl?

01:10:50.610 --> 01:10:52.334
Look at me.

01:10:52.912 --> 01:10:54.970
Do you like the girl?

01:10:59.902 --> 01:11:01.920
Why don't you go for the boat?

01:11:04.990 --> 01:11:06.882
Maybe I will.

01:11:08.561 --> 01:11:10.119
Please.

01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.542
Do you see anything?

01:12:09.622 --> 01:12:12.275
The infirmary, but no movement.

01:12:12.892 --> 01:12:14.580
That means they could be back
out in the woods.

01:12:14.660 --> 01:12:17.157
Where are you, you sick son of a bitch?

01:12:20.232 --> 01:12:21.820
<i>Hola.</i>

01:12:22.668 --> 01:12:24.939
- Something's movin'.
- Let me see.

01:12:31.396 --> 01:12:33.755
- I don't see anything.
- Be patient.

01:12:36.982 --> 01:12:39.842
- There he is. There he is, I see him.
- Give me the gun.

01:12:58.237 --> 01:12:59.619
That was weird.

01:13:00.339 --> 01:13:02.764
- What?
- He's gone.

01:13:03.358 --> 01:13:07.600
We get in there, we get Samuel, we find
the boat and we get the hell off this island.

01:13:08.288 --> 01:13:09.625
Give me the knife.

01:13:19.158 --> 01:13:20.912
You comin'?

01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:36.311
Hold on.

01:13:44.850 --> 01:13:48.065
Check out Samuel, patch him up quick.
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:13:49.922 --> 01:13:53.245
Shh, we're gonna get you out of here, okay.
Just stay quiet, okay.

01:13:53.325 --> 01:13:57.344
We have to move. We have to move now.
We need a stretcher or something, Rick.

01:13:58.664 --> 01:14:00.506
I don't see anything.

01:14:11.611 --> 01:14:13.468
Let go.

01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:16.267
Step back.

01:14:18.150 --> 01:14:20.008
Step back!

01:14:28.528 --> 01:14:30.391
Now, you...

01:14:31.767 --> 01:14:33.603
...give me the knife.

01:14:34.366 --> 01:14:36.190
Very slowly.

01:14:44.777 --> 01:14:47.186
I love it, I love it, I love it.

01:14:50.846 --> 01:14:52.881
Good evening, Ms. Richards.

01:14:54.687 --> 01:14:57.176
I'm very impressed with you.

01:14:57.256 --> 01:14:59.699
Wish I could say the same thing about you.

01:15:03.566 --> 01:15:06.048
- The kid lives.
- <i>Da.</i>

01:15:06.128 --> 01:15:07.957
You have good blood.

01:15:10.936 --> 01:15:12.794
But you...

01:15:13.823 --> 01:15:15.564
...Mr. Rainsford...

01:15:17.643 --> 01:15:20.697
...you are the biggest disappointment...

01:15:21.318 --> 01:15:23.198
...of all.

01:15:25.050 --> 01:15:26.808
You're big...

01:15:28.821 --> 01:15:30.712
...you're strong...

01:15:32.457 --> 01:15:35.483
...but you are weak...

01:15:36.879 --> 01:15:38.437
...sensitive...

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.457
...and vulnerable.

01:15:43.903 --> 01:15:46.940
Relax. Enjoy the game.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:52.534
Ivan, I would like to speak
to Mr. Rainsford alone.

01:15:52.614 --> 01:15:54.073
Please.

01:15:54.153 --> 01:15:55.601
<i>Da.</i>

01:15:55.681 --> 01:15:57.506
Pick him up.

01:15:58.683 --> 01:16:01.388
- Pick him up!
- I heard you. Come on.

01:16:01.754 --> 01:16:03.375
You're okay.

01:16:03.455 --> 01:16:05.720
Come on, come on, it's okay, it's okay.

01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.344
Come on, a little faster perhaps.

01:16:13.598 --> 01:16:17.094
- Don't do this.
- Look after yourself.

01:16:20.572 --> 01:16:23.631
Just be who you are.

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.536
Now please, sit down.

01:16:36.889 --> 01:16:38.711
Come on, move faster.

01:16:38.791 --> 01:16:41.083
We're moving as fast as we can.

01:16:43.062 --> 01:16:46.127
I'm in a bit of a quandary, Mr. Rainsford.

01:16:50.035 --> 01:16:51.926
Keep moving.

01:16:52.404 --> 01:16:53.998
Run!

01:17:01.346 --> 01:17:03.004
Let go.

01:17:09.989 --> 01:17:11.846
It's over.

01:17:12.391 --> 01:17:14.215
She's dead.

01:17:19.732 --> 01:17:21.556
Look at me.

01:17:23.568 --> 01:17:26.748
Maybe we should go back
to my house and have a drink, huh?

01:17:29.291 --> 01:17:32.351
I'm in a quandary, Mr. Rainsford.

01:17:35.414 --> 01:17:38.615
I don't know if I should
just kill you right here...

01:17:39.443 --> 01:17:41.240
...right now.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.393
You have no heart...

01:17:44.134 --> 01:17:45.548
...no sport...

01:17:45.628 --> 01:17:47.279
...no courage.

01:17:47.359 --> 01:17:50.013
You are a coward.

01:17:51.096 --> 01:17:53.317
How does that make you feel?

01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:06.869
Let me explain it this way.

01:18:11.904 --> 01:18:14.542
Please, help me.

01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:18.519
What do I need to do to motivate you?

01:18:19.658 --> 01:18:21.937
I've killed your girlfriend...

01:18:23.062 --> 01:18:25.354
...I have killed your friend.

01:18:26.999 --> 01:18:30.256
If it's not revenge,
what would I need to do...

01:18:30.336 --> 01:18:32.361
...to motivate you?

01:18:44.416 --> 01:18:47.609
- Did you take care of the girl?
- Yes. <i>Da.</i>

01:18:51.523 --> 01:18:53.394
There is a new game...

01:18:54.985 --> 01:18:56.788
...that has a twist.

01:18:58.931 --> 01:19:00.069
Please.

01:19:03.802 --> 01:19:06.129
Ivan, I will ask you one more time.

01:19:07.256 --> 01:19:09.148
Did you kill the girl?

01:19:10.142 --> 01:19:11.550
<i>Da.</i>

01:19:14.914 --> 01:19:16.955
Well, now it is over.

01:19:18.850 --> 01:19:21.477
Rick, look at Ivan.

01:19:22.621 --> 01:19:24.478
Tell me.

01:19:26.491 --> 01:19:28.580
Did he kill the girl?

01:19:30.429 --> 01:19:32.284
<i>Listen to me.</i>

01:19:32.364 --> 01:19:34.253
<i>I am trying to help you.</i>

01:19:34.333 --> 01:19:35.955
The boat is booby trap.

01:19:36.035 --> 01:19:38.891
A couple of clicks north there's
another cove with another boat.

01:19:38.971 --> 01:19:42.233
You must go there.
It's safer there. Take the boy.

01:19:42.313 --> 01:19:44.529
- Go to the other boat, please.
- What?

01:19:44.609 --> 01:19:46.047
<i>How do I know I can trust you?</i>

01:19:48.347 --> 01:19:51.612
Okay. I am not a bad man.

01:19:52.952 --> 01:19:54.874
You must trust me.

01:19:54.954 --> 01:19:56.460
Please.

01:20:06.065 --> 01:20:07.569
No.

01:20:12.471 --> 01:20:13.992
No.

01:20:16.608 --> 01:20:18.166
Colonel.

01:20:19.544 --> 01:20:23.238
There is one absolute, Mr. Rainsford.

01:20:25.014 --> 01:20:27.442
I will either kill you...

01:20:28.753 --> 01:20:30.606
...or you...

01:20:30.996 --> 01:20:32.687
...will kill me.

01:20:34.759 --> 01:20:38.252
This is how the game will go.

01:20:40.665 --> 01:20:42.256
Yes.

01:20:55.747 --> 01:20:58.373
Well, then, Mr. Rainsford...

01:20:58.850 --> 01:21:01.342
...please show me.

01:21:07.877 --> 01:21:09.521
Thank you.

01:21:15.867 --> 01:21:17.625
Game on.

01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:42.875
Well, well, well, Mr. Rainsford.

01:22:01.513 --> 01:22:03.757
I love it, I love it, I love it.

01:22:07.286 --> 01:22:09.241
Come on, you can do it.

01:22:09.321 --> 01:22:13.165
We're getting closer,
we're getting closer now. I know. Okay.

01:22:16.861 --> 01:22:18.250
What?

01:22:18.330 --> 01:22:19.851
Samuel.

01:22:19.931 --> 01:22:22.321
No, Samuel. Move, move.

01:22:22.401 --> 01:22:24.458
- Stop!
- Move!

01:22:25.320 --> 01:22:27.193
Thank you...

01:22:27.273 --> 01:22:29.674
...for coming back for me.

01:22:29.941 --> 01:22:32.769
Samuel, no, no, no, no.

01:22:32.849 --> 01:22:35.253
You're... you're not gonna die. No.

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:43.008
I think with Anna...

01:22:43.488 --> 01:22:47.181
...I'll skip the hunt for one kill.

01:23:36.841 --> 01:23:38.399
Dammit.

01:23:56.295 --> 01:23:58.353
Well, Mr. Rainsford...

01:23:59.698 --> 01:24:02.157
...as much as I've enjoyed this...

01:24:03.935 --> 01:24:05.805
...all good things...

01:24:06.416 --> 01:24:08.126
...must come to an end.

01:24:17.649 --> 01:24:19.373
Game over.

01:24:46.378 --> 01:24:47.936
Rick.

01:24:49.531 --> 01:24:51.055
Rick.

01:24:59.291 --> 01:25:01.149
Oh, God.

01:25:06.565 --> 01:25:08.122
Samuel?

01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:13.727
Come on.

01:25:14.444 --> 01:25:16.163
Oh, God.

01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:07.742
There it is.

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:10.576
Ivan was right.

01:27:11.356 --> 01:27:12.677
It's the cove.

01:27:12.757 --> 01:27:15.547
<i>After many more reports
of wreckage being found...</i>

01:27:15.627 --> 01:27:19.225
<i>...U.S. and Russian government officials
are beginning cooperation...</i>

01:27:19.305 --> 01:27:21.085
<i>...to find the missing passengers.</i>

01:27:21.165 --> 01:27:24.423

01:27:24.903 --> 01:27:27.559
<i>With the tremendous cooperation
with the Russian military...</i>

01:27:27.639 --> 01:27:31.430

underway to find the missing passengers.</i>

01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:34.603

has already been dispatched.</i>
