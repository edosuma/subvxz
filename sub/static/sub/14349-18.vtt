The precise meaning
of the word desert

- No, sir.

Wait. Verified, sir.

You know, I admire
your Napoleon very much.

our medical officer,

Welcome, good physicianer

13:33.936 --> 13:36.427
I'm a scientist,
not a military man.

13:36.505 --> 13:37.938
Oh, come now.

13:38.007 --> 13:40.942
We're all military men
under the skin.

13:41.010 --> 13:43.843
And how we do love our uniforms.

13:49.051 --> 13:51.019
What an interesting weapon

13:51.087 --> 13:52.520
you've got there.

13:53.856 --> 13:55.721
Do let me see it.

14:01.430 --> 14:02.556
Oh...

14:02.631 --> 14:03.563
yes.

14:03.632 --> 14:05.224
Now, let me see.

14:06.302 --> 14:08.429
How does this work?

14:08.504 --> 14:09.835
Ah, yes.

14:09.905 --> 14:11.930
This won't kill,

14:12.008 --> 14:13.532
and this will.

14:14.777 --> 14:15.709
Oh.

14:20.983 --> 14:22.575
Oh, how marvelous!

14:25.287 --> 14:26.879
Devastating!

14:26.956 --> 14:28.753
Why, this could kill millions.

14:31.660 --> 14:33.594
Who will you start with,

14:33.662 --> 14:34.594

14:34.663 --> 14:36.597
Are we your next targets?

14:36.665 --> 14:39.099
Oh, how absolutely typical
of your species.

14:39.168 --> 14:40.601
You don't understand some things,

14:40.669 --> 14:42.102
so you become fearful.

14:42.171 --> 14:44.105
Now, do let me anticipate

14:44.173 --> 14:45.606
your next question.

14:45.674 --> 14:48.609
You want to know how
I've managed all ofthis.

14:48.677 --> 14:49.609
That's correct.

14:49.678 --> 14:50.610
We,

14:50.679 --> 14:52.112
meaning I and others,

14:52.181 --> 14:53.113
have,

14:53.182 --> 14:54.615
to state the matter briefly,

14:54.683 --> 14:56.048
perfected a system

14:56.118 --> 14:58.552
by which matter can be
transferred to energy

14:58.621 --> 14:59.883
and back to matter again.

14:59.955 --> 15:02.116
Like the Enterprise's
transporter system.

15:02.191 --> 15:03.988
Oh, a crude example

15:04.060 --> 15:07.120
of an infinitely
more sophisticated process.

15:07.196 --> 15:08.128
You see,

15:08.197 --> 15:09.630
we not only transport matter

15:09.698 --> 15:11.131
from place to place,

15:11.200 --> 15:13.464
but we can alter its shape...

15:13.536 --> 15:14.468
at will.

15:14.537 --> 15:16.129
This drawing room...

15:16.205 --> 15:17.638
did you create it

15:17.706 --> 15:19.970
by rearranging matter
on this planet?

15:20.042 --> 15:20.974
Quite.

15:21.043 --> 15:22.977
I see.

15:24.046 --> 15:25.479
How did you manage--

15:25.548 --> 15:27.709
Your inquiries
are becoming tiresome.

15:27.783 --> 15:29.717
I want you to be happy.

15:29.785 --> 15:31.218
Free yourself of care.

15:31.287 --> 15:32.720
Let's enjoy ourselves

in the spirit of martial
good fellowship.

15:35.291 --> 15:37.282
We're getting out of here.

15:37.359 --> 15:38.951
You're being quite rude.

15:39.028 --> 15:40.461
You can't go.

15:40.529 --> 15:41.461
Apparently,

15:41.530 --> 15:42.963
you need another demonstration

15:43.032 --> 15:45.193
of my authority.

15:46.335 --> 15:47.563
Yes, quite.

15:59.081 --> 16:01.015
[ Coughing ]

16:05.054 --> 16:06.487
Now, that's a sample

16:06.555 --> 16:08.489
of the atmosphere
of this planet

16:08.557 --> 16:10.184
outside my kindly influence.

16:10.259 --> 16:12.489
Now, you will behave yourself

16:12.561 --> 16:14.153
here after, won't you?

16:14.230 --> 16:16.164
Or I shall be very,

16:16.232 --> 16:17.790
very angry.

Captain 's Log-- Stardate 2125. 7.

16:26.208 --> 16:29.473
Science Officer Spock
reporting for Captain Kirk.

16:29.545 --> 16:32.810
We have completed
14th orbit of this planet

16:32.882 --> 16:35.112
without establishing contact
with our missing officers

16:35.184 --> 16:37.618
or the parties sent to find them.

16:37.686 --> 16:40.154
Subspace communications
remain blocked.

16:40.222 --> 16:42.156
However,
by diverting impulse power

16:42.224 --> 16:43.657
to our sensors,

16:43.726 --> 16:45.159
we have made them operable,

16:45.227 --> 16:47.661
and we have detected
one small area

16:47.730 --> 16:49.163
on the surface

16:49.231 --> 16:50.664
which seems relatively stable.

16:50.733 --> 16:52.166
Aye, it's there, Mr. Spock.

16:52.234 --> 16:54.668
Peaceful as Earth,
but how do you explain it?

16:54.737 --> 16:56.102
I don't, Mr. Scott.

16:56.172 --> 16:57.605
It simply exists.

16:57.673 --> 16:59.607
Artificial
or a freak of nature.

16:59.675 --> 17:02.610
The fact remains that life
can exist in that area.

17:02.678 --> 17:05.112
Aye, it could, but it
couldn't move around much.

17:05.181 --> 17:07.615
Apply a fine tuning
on our sensors.

17:07.683 --> 17:09.946
Locate any life-forms
in that stable area.

17:10.019 --> 17:12.817
If we find any,
it may not be our people.

17:12.887 --> 17:13.945
Affirmative.

17:14.022 --> 17:16.457
But if the captain
is down there and alive,

17:16.525 --> 17:18.459
that's where he'll have to be.

17:18.527 --> 17:19.960
We'll attempt to transport up

17:20.029 --> 17:21.963
any living beings

17:23.632 --> 17:27.261
Or stand by and do nothing,
Mr. Scott.

17:30.906 --> 17:32.271
And this, of course,

17:32.341 --> 17:35.469
is an array of your
battle flags and pennants

17:35.544 --> 17:37.136
dating back to the Crusades,

17:37.213 --> 17:38.646
to Hannibal's invaders,

17:38.714 --> 17:41.148
the Grecian war galleys,
and the hordes of Persia.

17:41.217 --> 17:43.151
Can't you imagine it, Captain?

17:43.219 --> 17:44.652
The thousands of men

17:44.720 --> 17:46.654
marching off to their deaths,

17:46.722 --> 17:48.883
singing beneath these banners.

17:48.958 --> 17:51.893
Doesn't it make
your blood run swiftly?

17:51.961 --> 17:53.326
Captain...

17:53.395 --> 17:55.761
where could he
possibly come from?

17:55.831 --> 17:57.799
Who is this maniac?

17:57.866 --> 17:59.800
Better say, what is he?

17:59.868 --> 18:01.301
I monitored him,

18:01.370 --> 18:03.668
and what I found
was unbelievable.

18:03.739 --> 18:04.671
Not alive?

18:04.740 --> 18:07.174
Not in the way we define life.

18:07.243 --> 18:08.676
No trace.

18:08.744 --> 18:09.676
Zero.

18:09.745 --> 18:10.677
You mean...

18:10.746 --> 18:12.236
it shows he's dead?

18:12.314 --> 18:15.681
It doesn't even show
that he exists at all,

18:15.751 --> 18:17.184
alive or dead.

18:17.253 --> 18:19.187
Notice the wood fire, Captain?

18:19.255 --> 18:21.348
Burning steadily,
ember bed glowing,

18:21.423 --> 18:24.551

any heat at all.

for present-day Earth

18:32.568 --> 18:34.297
the time differential.

18:34.370 --> 18:36.600
Whatever we're dealing with,

18:36.672 --> 18:39.197
he certainly isn't
all-knowledgeable.

18:39.275 --> 18:41.709
He makes mistakes.

I'll wager.

19:03.332 --> 19:05.095
If your admiration
is genuine,

for our sense of duty.

22:35.944 --> 22:37.605
No.

22:37.679 --> 22:41.410
But so much more fitting,
honorable sir.

22:41.483 --> 22:42.609
You...

22:42.684 --> 22:43.878
DeSalle.

22:45.153 --> 22:47.849
Oh, what primitive fury.

22:49.591 --> 22:51.752
Why, he's the very soul
of sublime savagery.

22:51.827 --> 22:53.226
Trelane, let him go.

22:54.463 --> 22:56.829
We haven't even got our phasers.

22:56.899 --> 22:58.332
Yes, of course.

22:58.400 --> 23:00.834
I forget that I shouldn't
frighten you too much.

23:00.903 --> 23:02.336
But I warn you,

23:02.404 --> 23:04.338
you can't provoke me again.

23:04.406 --> 23:05.805
Come, everyone.

23:05.874 --> 23:07.808
Let's forget your bad manners.

23:07.876 --> 23:10.310
Let's be full of merry talk

23:10.379 --> 23:11.812
and sallies ofwit.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.314
We have victuals
to delight the palate

23:14.383 --> 23:17.318
and brave company
to delight the mind.

23:17.386 --> 23:19.013
Come, Doctor,

23:19.087 --> 23:20.418
do partake.

23:25.394 --> 23:27.453
Ah, you've been, uh...

23:27.529 --> 23:28.461
quite derelict

23:28.530 --> 23:30.828
in your social duties, Captain.

23:30.899 --> 23:32.332
You haven't introduced me

23:32.401 --> 23:35.427
to the charming contingent
of your crew.

23:35.504 --> 23:36.835
This is...

23:36.905 --> 23:38.167
General Trelane.

23:38.240 --> 23:39.434
Retired.

23:39.508 --> 23:41.237
But if you prefer,

23:41.310 --> 23:42.743
you may address me

23:42.811 --> 23:45.302
as the lonely squire of Gothos,
dear ladies.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.813
Lieutenant Uhura
of Communications.

23:46.882 --> 23:47.814
Ah...

23:47.883 --> 23:49.817
a Nubian prize.

23:53.221 --> 23:56.452
Taken on one of your raids of conquest,
no doubt, Captain.

23:56.525 --> 23:57.492
No doubt.

23:57.559 --> 23:59.220
She has the melting eyes

23:59.294 --> 24:01.023
of the queen of Sheba,

24:01.096 --> 24:02.688
the same lovely coloring.

24:03.599 --> 24:05.032
And this.

24:05.100 --> 24:06.533
Is this the face

24:06.602 --> 24:08.502
that launched a thousand ships

24:08.570 --> 24:10.970
and burnt the topless towers
of Ilium?

24:11.039 --> 24:11.971
Fair Helen,

24:12.040 --> 24:14.474
make me immortal with a kiss.

24:14.543 --> 24:15.976
Yeoman Teresa Ross.

24:16.044 --> 24:17.477
I believe you have met

24:17.546 --> 24:19.480
our science officer
Mr. Spock.

24:20.549 --> 24:21.982
You do realize, don't you,

24:22.050 --> 24:24.484
that it's in deference
to the captain

24:24.553 --> 24:25.986
that I brought you here?

24:26.054 --> 24:27.043
Affirmative.

24:27.122 --> 24:29.818
Well, I don't know
if I like your tone.

24:29.891 --> 24:31.654
It's most challenging.

24:31.727 --> 24:33.888
That's what you're doing,
challenging me?

24:33.962 --> 24:35.395
I object to you.

24:35.464 --> 24:38.262
I object to intellect
without discipline.

24:38.333 --> 24:39.766
I object to power

24:39.835 --> 24:41.496
without constructive purpose.

24:41.570 --> 24:43.003
Oh, Mr. Spock,

24:43.071 --> 24:45.767
you do have one saving grace
after all.

24:45.841 --> 24:47.274
You're ill-mannered.

24:47.342 --> 24:50.743
The human half of you, no doubt.

24:54.016 --> 24:55.108
Ah, come,

24:55.183 --> 24:56.548
my little wood nymph.

24:56.618 --> 24:58.609
Won't you dance with your swain?

24:58.687 --> 25:01.622
Give us some sprightly music,
my dear girl.

25:01.690 --> 25:04.124
Oh, I don't know
how to play this.

25:04.192 --> 25:06.456
Of course you do.

25:38.560 --> 25:39.686
Captain,

25:39.761 --> 25:43.197
how far do we go along
with this charade?

25:43.265 --> 25:46.200
Until we can think
our way out.

25:46.268 --> 25:48.202
Meanwhile, we accept
his hospitality.

25:48.270 --> 25:49.999
You should taste his food.

25:50.072 --> 25:52.700
Straw would taste better
than his meat,

25:52.774 --> 25:55.140
water a hundred times
better than his brandy.

25:55.210 --> 25:57.508
Nothing has any taste at all.

25:57.579 --> 25:59.513
It may be unappetizing,
Doctor,

25:59.581 --> 26:01.208
but it is very logical.

26:01.283 --> 26:03.217
There's that magic word again.

26:03.285 --> 26:06.743
Does your logic find this
fascinating, Mr. Spock?

26:06.822 --> 26:10.758
No. "Fascinating" is a word
I use for the unexpected.

26:10.826 --> 26:12.259
In this case,

26:12.327 --> 26:14.591
I should think "interesting"
would suffice.

26:14.663 --> 26:17.393
You don't find this
unexpected, Mr. Spock?

26:17.466 --> 26:21.402
That his food has no taste,
his wine no flavor?

26:21.470 --> 26:22.903
No. It simply means

26:22.971 --> 26:25.337
that Trelane knows
all ofthe Earth forms,

26:25.407 --> 26:26.772
but none ofthe substance.

26:26.842 --> 26:28.275
And if he's fallible,

26:28.343 --> 26:30.038
he can't be all-powerful,

26:30.112 --> 26:33.275
which means he has
something helping him.

26:33.348 --> 26:34.440
Evidently.

26:34.516 --> 26:35.881
A machine?

26:36.718 --> 26:37.912
A device?

26:39.321 --> 26:42.256
Something which does
these things for him.

26:48.830 --> 26:52.459
Ah, my dear, don't we make
a graceful pair?

26:53.802 --> 26:55.895
Except for one small detail--

26:55.971 --> 26:59.566
that dress hardly matches
this charming scene.

27:06.114 --> 27:08.605
Ah, yes, that's more
what we want--

27:08.683 --> 27:11.379
the dashing warrior
and his elegant lady.

27:27.202 --> 27:28.863
That mirror...

27:28.937 --> 27:31.804
it's part of his audience,
his ego.

27:31.873 --> 27:33.306
He never wanders from it.

27:33.375 --> 27:35.070
Is it ego...

27:36.144 --> 27:37.304
or something else?

27:37.379 --> 27:38.505
Explain.

27:38.580 --> 27:39.740
The mirror.

27:39.815 --> 27:40.747
What?

27:40.816 --> 27:43.808
You noted he never
gets far from it.

27:43.885 --> 27:45.910
I suppose it could be vanity.

27:45.987 --> 27:48.478
No, no, Mr. Spock,
that's not the reason.

27:50.725 --> 27:54.252
What kind ofa machine
could do these things?

27:54.329 --> 27:56.194
A machine with the ability

27:56.264 --> 27:59.256
to turn energy into matter

27:59.334 --> 28:00.767
guided by thought waves.

28:00.836 --> 28:04.033
It would have
a very complex memory bank.

28:04.105 --> 28:05.538
It would be
extremely sophisticated.

28:05.607 --> 28:08.007
Like a computer,
only much more.

28:09.411 --> 28:10.844
Could the machine

28:10.912 --> 28:13.176
that maintains the environment
in this immediate area

28:13.248 --> 28:14.715
be kept in this house?

28:14.783 --> 28:16.216
I think not.

28:16.284 --> 28:17.717
A device capable

28:17.786 --> 28:20.380
of keeping out this planet's
natural atmosphere

28:20.455 --> 28:21.888
would be immense.

28:21.957 --> 28:23.549
Good. I agree.

28:24.526 --> 28:26.187
That leaves me free.

28:26.261 --> 28:27.353
Free, Captain?

28:27.429 --> 28:31.297
If I'm not mistaken,
Mr. Spock,

28:31.366 --> 28:36.360
I think I can turn
his lights off

28:36.438 --> 28:39.339
at the source.

28:41.710 --> 28:45.146
Don't be too upset
by what you see, gentlemen.

28:45.213 --> 28:47.147
After all,
his actions are those

28:47.215 --> 28:49.149
ofan immature, unbalanced mind.

28:49.217 --> 28:50.650
I overheard that remark,
Captain.

28:50.719 --> 28:53.153
I'm afraid I'll have
to dispense with you.

28:53.221 --> 28:55.155
You only heard part of it.

28:55.223 --> 28:56.588
I just started.

28:56.658 --> 28:57.625
Oh?

28:57.692 --> 29:00.661
Yes. I want you
to leave my crew alone.

29:00.729 --> 29:02.162
Don't dance with him.

29:02.230 --> 29:03.663
Did it make you angry?

29:03.732 --> 29:05.666
Don't accept his gifts,
either.

29:05.734 --> 29:08.168
I believe the dear captain's
Jealous of me.

29:08.236 --> 29:10.170
I don't care what you believe.

29:10.238 --> 29:11.705
Keep your hands off her!

29:11.773 --> 29:13.707
How curiously human,
how wonderfully barbaric.

29:13.775 --> 29:15.572
I've had enough
of your attentions to her.

29:15.644 --> 29:16.611
Of course.

29:16.678 --> 29:19.169
That's the root
of the matter, isn't it?

29:19.247 --> 29:21.306
You fight for the attention,
admiration,

29:21.383 --> 29:22.509
possession of women.

29:22.584 --> 29:25.018
If it's fighting
that you want,

29:25.086 --> 29:26.348
you may have it.

29:26.421 --> 29:29.049
Are you challenging me
to a duel?

29:29.124 --> 29:30.523
If you have the courage.

29:30.592 --> 29:32.526
This is better
than I'd planned.

29:32.594 --> 29:36.086
I shall not shirk
an affair of honor.

29:41.136 --> 29:42.569
A matched set--

29:42.637 --> 29:44.070
Just like the pair

29:44.139 --> 29:47.700
that slew your heroic
Alexander Hamilton.

29:49.945 --> 29:51.913
And, Captain...

29:54.149 --> 29:56.743
I never miss.

30:04.392 --> 30:05.552
Captain 's Log,

30:05.627 --> 30:08.960
Stardate 2126. 1,
delayed report--

30:09.030 --> 30:11.123
the whole bridge crew
are the unwilling guests

30:11.199 --> 30:14.168
of the creature
who calls himself Trelane.

30:14.235 --> 30:16.226
We are weaponless, powerless,

30:16.304 --> 30:17.566
and our only hope of escape

30:17.639 --> 30:18.697
with the Enterprise

30:18.773 --> 30:21.867
lies in playing his games.

30:21.943 --> 30:23.672
I've decided to make my move

30:23.745 --> 30:26.009
with the field-of-honor game,

30:26.081 --> 30:28.311
and everything depends
on my one chance

30:28.383 --> 30:30.817
with the ancient dueling pistol.

30:30.885 --> 30:32.318
Oh, how fascinating.

30:32.387 --> 30:35.220
I'm party
to an actual human duel.

30:35.290 --> 30:36.222
Ready?

30:36.291 --> 30:37.588
Quite ready, sir.

30:37.659 --> 30:39.627
We shall test
each other's courage,

30:39.694 --> 30:40.626
and then...

30:40.695 --> 30:43.664
and then we shall see.

30:43.732 --> 30:45.757
Let's get on with it.

30:45.834 --> 30:47.267
As you will, sir.

30:47.335 --> 30:50.270
Honor will be served, eh?

30:50.338 --> 30:51.464
Oh, wait!

30:51.539 --> 30:55.202
As the one challenged,
I claim the first shot.

30:55.276 --> 30:56.641
We shoot together.

30:56.711 --> 30:59.908
It's my game and my rules,

30:59.981 --> 31:02.916
but if you need
to be persuaded...

31:10.992 --> 31:12.118
All right.

31:12.193 --> 31:14.024
Captain...

31:35.750 --> 31:39.186
And now, Captain,
how do you have the expression?

31:39.254 --> 31:43.782
My fate is in your hands.

32:08.917 --> 32:10.282
You've ruined everything!

32:11.553 --> 32:13.077
The machine.

32:13.154 --> 32:14.712
[ Communicator Beeps ]

32:14.789 --> 32:16.222
Subspace interference
is clearing.

32:16.291 --> 32:18.259
Try to contact the ship.

32:18.326 --> 32:20.760
The remarkable treachery
of this species.

32:20.829 --> 32:22.592
Go on, Trelane. Look at it.

32:22.664 --> 32:23.596
It's over.

32:23.665 --> 32:25.098
Your power is blanked out.

32:25.166 --> 32:26.098
You're finished.

32:26.167 --> 32:28.601
You've earned my wrath.

32:28.670 --> 32:31.605
Go back.
Go back to your ship,

32:31.673 --> 32:33.106
all of you,

32:33.174 --> 32:34.106
and prepare.

32:34.175 --> 32:35.608
You're all dead men--

32:35.677 --> 32:38.145
you especially, Captain.

32:42.350 --> 32:44.147
Trelane?

32:45.987 --> 32:48.922
Everyone, we're getting out
of here, and now.

32:48.990 --> 32:50.423
This is the captain.

32:50.492 --> 32:53.256
Commence beaming up--
maximum speed.

32:59.167 --> 33:01.601
Set course for Colony Beta 6.

33:01.669 --> 33:02.897
Linking, sir.

33:02.971 --> 33:05.405
Full-power acceleration
from orbit, Mr. Scott.

33:05.473 --> 33:06.906
Full power, sir.

33:06.975 --> 33:09.409
Emergency warp at the earliest
possible moment,

33:09.477 --> 33:10.409
Mr. Sulu.

33:10.478 --> 33:12.207
Standing by to warp, sir.

33:18.686 --> 33:21.621
Shall I make a full report
to Spacefleet Command?

33:21.689 --> 33:24.385
Not yet.
They may trace our beam.

33:24.459 --> 33:27.587
Wait until we're
well out of range.

33:27.662 --> 33:29.789
Can we know his range,
Captain?

33:29.864 --> 33:31.798
We can take an educated guess--

33:31.866 --> 33:34.266
at the point we entered
their solar system.

33:34.335 --> 33:36.166
Still no sign of pursuit.

33:36.237 --> 33:37.670
Instruments clear, sir.

33:37.739 --> 33:38.671
Good.

33:44.045 --> 33:46.912
May I take a moment to change?

33:46.981 --> 33:49.541
Yes, I think you might.

33:49.617 --> 33:51.551
Turn in your glass slippers.

33:51.619 --> 33:53.052
The ball is over.

33:53.121 --> 33:54.053
Gladly, Captain.

34:01.496 --> 34:05.023
Hard to believe
that it ever happened.

34:05.099 --> 34:07.033
Captain, we're about to warp.

34:07.101 --> 34:08.431
Large body ahead.

34:15.543 --> 34:16.601
Collision course.

34:16.678 --> 34:18.543
Hard to port, Mr. Sulu.

34:27.455 --> 34:30.014
That was the planet Gothos,
Captain.

34:30.091 --> 34:31.614
Gothos!

34:33.127 --> 34:35.027
Have we been going in circles?

34:35.096 --> 34:37.326
No. All instruments
show on-course.

34:37.398 --> 34:38.489
Gothos again.

34:41.936 --> 34:42.868
Hard over.

34:48.443 --> 34:51.036
Cat-and-mouse game.

34:51.112 --> 34:53.205
With us as the mouse.

34:53.281 --> 34:55.875
90 degrees to starboard,
Mr. Sulu.

34:55.949 --> 34:56.882
Turning, Captain.

34:59.020 --> 35:00.885
Now veering aftwards.

35:02.123 --> 35:04.819
90 degrees subport, Mr. Sulu.

35:04.892 --> 35:05.950
Adjust.

35:08.730 --> 35:10.994
Turn completed

35:11.065 --> 35:12.965
and still accelerating
toward the planet.

35:13.034 --> 35:14.558
Or it toward us.

35:18.306 --> 35:20.570
Decelerate into orbit.
Prepare transporter room.

35:20.642 --> 35:22.576
Captain,
you're not beaming down.

35:22.644 --> 35:24.544
Yes, I am, Dr. McCoy.

35:24.612 --> 35:27.638
I am going to see
our playful Mr. Trelane

35:27.715 --> 35:29.148
and whatever it takes

35:29.217 --> 35:31.651
to make him give up our ship.

35:31.719 --> 35:33.152
Stand by communications.

35:33.221 --> 35:36.588
If you don't receive a message
from me within the hour,

35:36.658 --> 35:40.424
Leave the vicinity at once.
No turning back.

35:43.765 --> 35:46.199
The prisoner
may approach the bench.

35:51.572 --> 35:52.539
Trelane.

35:59.614 --> 36:01.047
Any attempt at demonstrations

36:01.115 --> 36:03.549
will weigh against you
with the court,

36:03.618 --> 36:08.521
and this time my instrumentality
is unbreakable.

36:10.692 --> 36:13.126
I've had enough of your games.

36:13.194 --> 36:16.755
Oh, the absurdity
of these inferior beings.

36:20.068 --> 36:22.002
"And now, Captain James Kirk,

36:22.070 --> 36:25.005
you stand accused
of the high crime oftreason

36:25.073 --> 36:27.064
against a superior authority,

36:27.141 --> 36:28.574
conspiracy,

36:28.643 --> 36:31.077
and the attempt
to foment insurrection."

36:33.047 --> 36:34.514
How do you plead?

36:34.582 --> 36:37.642
I haven't come to plead
in your court, Trelane.

36:37.719 --> 36:40.654
Anything you might say
has already been taken down

36:40.722 --> 36:42.189
in evidence against you.

36:42.256 --> 36:44.884
I've come to get back my ship.

36:44.959 --> 36:46.085
Irrelevant.

36:46.160 --> 36:49.323
We've made you angry
with our will to survive?

36:49.397 --> 36:50.694
Uncalled-for.

36:50.765 --> 36:52.699
Then vent your anger
on me alone.

36:52.767 --> 36:54.200
I led the others.

36:54.268 --> 36:56.566
I shot out your mirror machine.

36:56.637 --> 36:59.538
Did you think that was the only
medium of instrumentality

36:59.607 --> 37:00.904
at my command?

37:00.975 --> 37:02.408
I took that chance.

37:02.477 --> 37:05.537
I'm willing to pay the price
for chancing wrong.

37:05.613 --> 37:08.173
Oh, then you do admit
to the charges?

37:08.249 --> 37:09.181
Yes, anything!

37:09.250 --> 37:10.683
Just allow the Enterprise

37:10.752 --> 37:12.219
to continue its journey.

37:12.286 --> 37:14.117
Uhh!

37:14.188 --> 37:15.621
You pompous--

37:15.690 --> 37:16.748
Immaterial!

37:16.824 --> 37:19.258
Those people
have done you no harm.

37:19.327 --> 37:20.589
Inadmissible!

37:20.661 --> 37:23.494
We're living beings,
not playthings for your amusement.

37:23.564 --> 37:25.498
Silence!
This trial is over.

37:25.566 --> 37:26.999
You are guilty.

37:27.068 --> 37:29.229
On all counts,
you are guilty.

37:29.303 --> 37:30.736
According to your own laws,

37:30.805 --> 37:33.865
this court has no choice
in fixing punishment.

37:33.941 --> 37:36.876
You will hang by the neck,
Captain,

37:36.944 --> 37:39.970
until you are dead, dead, dead!

37:50.224 --> 37:54.786
Captain 's Log, Stardate 2126.3.

37:54.862 --> 37:56.295
First Officer Spock reporting.

37:56.364 --> 37:58.298
Still no word from Captain Kirk

37:58.366 --> 37:59.799
on the surface below us.

37:59.867 --> 38:01.596
Waiting time is almost up.

38:01.669 --> 38:04.968
I willsoon be forced
to attempt departure

38:05.039 --> 38:06.597
as per instructions.

38:13.314 --> 38:16.249
Until a moment ago,
I didn't think it possible,

38:16.317 --> 38:17.750
but it was.

38:17.819 --> 38:19.684
I did it. I was angry.

38:19.754 --> 38:22.552
I actually experienced
genuine rage.

38:22.623 --> 38:25.319
This experiment
has been successful.

38:25.393 --> 38:27.623
I'm glad you weren't
disappointed.

38:27.695 --> 38:28.753
Why, Captain,
you're still angry.

38:28.830 --> 38:32.960
Would that I could
have sustained that moment.

38:33.034 --> 38:35.594
Ah, no matter.

38:35.670 --> 38:38.104
Do you have a last request?

38:38.172 --> 38:41.608
If you think I'm going to
obediently stick my head

38:41.676 --> 38:43.109
in that noose--

38:43.177 --> 38:46.044
You still haven't learned.
You have no choice.

38:55.323 --> 38:57.587
Oh, this is becoming
quite tiresome.

38:57.658 --> 38:59.853
It's all so very easy.

38:59.927 --> 39:02.521
That's your problem,
Trelane--

39:02.597 --> 39:04.690
everything's easy.

39:04.765 --> 39:06.699
It's given you a bad habit.

39:06.767 --> 39:09.600
You're not aware of it,
but you have it.

39:09.670 --> 39:10.898
You don't think, Trelane.

39:10.972 --> 39:12.200
That's your problem.

39:12.273 --> 39:14.707
You miss opportunities,

39:14.775 --> 39:17.801
Iike your anger before
and mine right now.

39:17.879 --> 39:19.608
Oh, you enjoy it,

39:19.680 --> 39:22.114
but you couldn't have
accomplished it without me,

39:22.183 --> 39:24.117
and you know why?

39:24.185 --> 39:27.245
Because you're
a bumbling, inept fool.

39:27.321 --> 39:28.754
Take care, now.

39:28.823 --> 39:30.256
Here you have an opportunity

39:30.324 --> 39:31.848
to experience
something really unique,

39:31.926 --> 39:33.655
and you're wasting it.

39:33.728 --> 39:35.787
You want to commit murder?

39:35.863 --> 39:40.425
Go ahead, but where's the sport
in a simple hanging?

39:40.501 --> 39:41.832
The sport?

39:41.903 --> 39:43.165
Yes...

39:43.237 --> 39:46.297
the terror of murder,

39:46.374 --> 39:47.341
the suspense,

39:47.408 --> 39:49.273
the fun.

39:49.343 --> 39:50.776
Oh, I'm intrigued.

39:50.845 --> 39:52.278
Go ahead, Captain.

39:52.346 --> 39:54.007
What do you suggest?

40:02.356 --> 40:05.792
A personal conflict
between us--

40:05.860 --> 40:09.125
not like the duel before,

40:09.196 --> 40:11.460
but the real thing.

40:11.532 --> 40:12.658
The stakes?

40:12.733 --> 40:15.065
A human life--mine.

40:18.039 --> 40:19.666
Oh...

40:19.740 --> 40:21.037
yes!

40:21.108 --> 40:22.040
Yes!

40:22.109 --> 40:23.542
That's the idea.

40:23.611 --> 40:25.044
Oh, then you approve?

40:25.112 --> 40:26.044
Yes,

40:26.113 --> 40:27.137
but...

40:27.214 --> 40:29.648
you can do better than that.

40:29.717 --> 40:31.048
There's still not enough sport

40:31.118 --> 40:33.177
in killing me with a sword.

40:33.254 --> 40:36.382
I know. That will be dull.

40:36.457 --> 40:39.449
We'll have to have
something more fanciful.

40:39.527 --> 40:42.087
Let me see...

40:42.163 --> 40:44.825
a hunt, a royal hunt--

40:44.899 --> 40:46.264
predator against predator.

40:46.334 --> 40:50.168
Now, you may go hide in the forest--
anywhere you like--

40:50.237 --> 40:51.670
and I shall seek.

40:51.739 --> 40:54.799
How does that strike you,
Captain?

40:54.875 --> 40:56.968
It strikes me...

40:57.044 --> 40:58.238
very well...

40:59.880 --> 41:03.816
but you'll have to make it
worth my while, Trelane.

41:03.884 --> 41:06.546
Why not up the stakes?

41:06.621 --> 41:08.316
The stakes?

41:08.389 --> 41:10.289
Yes.

41:10.358 --> 41:12.918
While we're playing our game,

41:12.994 --> 41:14.859
free my ship.

41:14.929 --> 41:16.863
Let it continue on its way.

41:16.931 --> 41:17.898
In return,

41:17.965 --> 41:20.900
I'll give you a contest
you'll remember.

41:20.968 --> 41:22.560
Always back to your ship.

41:25.139 --> 41:27.437
Oh, well...

41:27.508 --> 41:30.443
if it will add spice
to the pursuit...

41:30.511 --> 41:33.309
I accept your terms, Captain.

41:35.282 --> 41:36.715
[ Trelane ]
Remember, you must try

41:36.784 --> 41:39.218
not to let me find you
too quickly.

41:39.286 --> 41:40.719
Let me notify the Enterprise

41:40.788 --> 41:43.018
that it can go.

41:43.090 --> 41:44.648
At your convenience.

41:48.029 --> 41:49.758
Enterprise...

41:49.830 --> 41:51.764
Enterprise, this is Kirk.

41:51.832 --> 41:53.265
Can you hear me?

41:53.334 --> 41:54.266
[ Static ]

41:54.335 --> 41:57.793
Get the ship away
as fast as you can.

41:57.872 --> 42:00.670
I'll try and give you
the time you need.

42:00.741 --> 42:02.902
Can you hear me?

42:02.977 --> 42:04.376
Aha!

42:14.221 --> 42:15.153
Enterprise...

42:15.222 --> 42:16.917
Ha ha!

42:16.991 --> 42:18.481
Captain Kirk.

42:23.497 --> 42:24.930
You must try harder,
Captain.

42:24.999 --> 42:26.660
This is too easy.

42:32.873 --> 42:34.067
Enterprise...

42:34.141 --> 42:35.870
Enterprise, can you hear me?

43:06.640 --> 43:08.540
Touche, Captain. Touche.

43:08.609 --> 43:11.043
I must confess you scored first,

43:11.112 --> 43:14.741
but after all, I never played
this game before.

43:16.250 --> 43:19.515
And now let's have at it again!

43:37.071 --> 43:40.598
Ha ha ha!

43:55.656 --> 43:57.283
Enterprise...

43:57.358 --> 43:58.416
Enterprise...

44:01.762 --> 44:03.195
Aha!

44:03.264 --> 44:04.788
Tallyho!

44:16.744 --> 44:17.972
Aha...

44:18.045 --> 44:20.741
You made a noble fight
of it, Captain.

44:20.815 --> 44:23.079
Remember, you promised
to let my ship go.

44:23.150 --> 44:24.583
But this is such sport.

44:24.652 --> 44:27.519
I must fetch all
the others back to play.

44:27.588 --> 44:29.920
So this is victory.

44:29.990 --> 44:32.151
It has a sweet taste.

44:32.226 --> 44:33.284
Down, Captain--

44:33.360 --> 44:35.658
on your knees!

44:35.729 --> 44:37.219
You haven't won, Trelane.

44:37.298 --> 44:39.266
I could run you through!

44:39.333 --> 44:41.233
But you haven't won anything.

44:41.302 --> 44:43.270
On your knees, Captain!

44:43.337 --> 44:45.237
No!

44:45.306 --> 44:47.399
Does it still taste as sweet?

44:47.474 --> 44:49.704
I order you.
You've been beaten!

44:49.777 --> 44:52.041
But I'm not defeated.

44:52.313 --> 44:54.679
I order you! I order you!

44:57.218 --> 44:58.651
You broke it!

44:58.719 --> 45:00.152
You broke my sword!

45:00.221 --> 45:02.212
You've got a lot to learn
about winning, Trelane.

45:02.289 --> 45:04.621
You dare to defy me!

45:04.692 --> 45:08.492
You've got a lot
to learn about everything.

45:09.563 --> 45:11.895
I'll fix you! You cheated!

45:11.966 --> 45:13.934
You haven't played the game right.

45:14.001 --> 45:15.263
I'll show you!

45:15.336 --> 45:18.032
[ Woman's Voice ]
Trelane!

45:20.241 --> 45:21.401
No!

45:24.245 --> 45:26.338
No!

45:26.413 --> 45:28.847
You said I could have
this planet.

45:28.916 --> 45:31.646
[ Man's Voice ]
This has gone far enough.

45:31.719 --> 45:34.517
But you always stop me
when I'm having fun.

45:34.588 --> 45:36.021
You're disobedient and cruel.

45:36.090 --> 45:37.523
We've told you before.

45:37.591 --> 45:39.491
Time to come in now, Trelane.

45:39.560 --> 45:41.892
I don't want to come in,
and I won't.

45:41.962 --> 45:43.395
I'm a general,

45:43.464 --> 45:45.329
and I won't listen to you.

45:45.399 --> 45:46.866
Enough, Trelane. Come along.

45:46.934 --> 45:48.868
But why?

45:48.936 --> 45:50.870
I didn't do anything wrong.

45:50.938 --> 45:52.462
I was just playing.

45:52.539 --> 45:54.370
We said come along.

45:54.441 --> 45:57.205
But I haven't finished
studying my predators yet.

45:57.278 --> 45:58.711
This is not studying them.

45:58.779 --> 46:02.215
If you cannot take proper care
of your pets,

46:02.283 --> 46:03.580
you cannot have them.

46:03.651 --> 46:06.484
Aw, but I was winning.
I was winning.

46:06.553 --> 46:08.316
They're beings, Trelane.

46:08.389 --> 46:10.289
They have spirit.
They're superior.

46:10.357 --> 46:13.121
No, no. You saw.

46:13.193 --> 46:14.626
You'll grow up, Trelane.

46:14.695 --> 46:15.627
You'll understand.

Now come along.

46:17.498 --> 46:19.932
Aw, but you said I could.

Stop that nonsense at once,

to make any more planets.

47:10.217 --> 47:12.378
He will be punished.

47:12.453 --> 47:14.648
We would not have
let him intercept you

47:14.722 --> 47:16.485
had we realized
your vulnerability.

47:16.557 --> 47:17.854
Forgive us, Captain.

47:17.925 --> 47:20.587
We will maintain
your life-support conditions

47:20.661 --> 47:22.788
while you return to your ship.

47:22.863 --> 47:25.957
Please accept our apologies.

47:36.176 --> 47:39.168
Captain to Enterprise.

47:39.246 --> 47:40.679
Captain to Enterprise.

47:40.748 --> 47:43.114
[ Spock ]
Captain, we're receiving you.

47:43.183 --> 47:45.651
Beam me up, Mr. Spock.

47:45.719 --> 47:47.380
We're free to go.

47:54.261 --> 47:55.694
Warping down, Captain.

47:55.763 --> 47:57.196
Our warp factor--4.

47:57.264 --> 47:59.232
Approach channels clear, Captain.

47:59.299 --> 48:01.233
Colony Beta 6 clears us

48:01.301 --> 48:03.235
for normal approach, sir.

48:03.303 --> 48:07.137
Normal orbit approach
procedures, Mr. Sulu.

48:07.207 --> 48:08.504
Captain.

48:08.575 --> 48:11.009
Still thinking about Trelane,
is that it?

48:11.078 --> 48:13.876
For the record,
how do we describe him--

48:13.947 --> 48:16.177
pure mentality,
force of intellect,

48:16.250 --> 48:19.083
embodied energy, superbeing?

48:19.153 --> 48:20.984
He must be classified, sir.

48:21.055 --> 48:23.319
God of war, Mr. Spock.

48:23.390 --> 48:26.188
Well, I hardly
find that fitting.

48:26.260 --> 48:28.854
Then a small boy,

48:28.929 --> 48:30.191
and a very naughty one.

48:30.264 --> 48:33.233
It will make a strange entry
in the library banks.

48:33.300 --> 48:35.734
He was a very strange
small boy.

48:35.803 --> 48:37.737
He was probably doing
things comparable

48:37.805 --> 48:40.239
to the mischievous pranks
you played

48:40.307 --> 48:41.604
when you were a boy.

48:41.675 --> 48:43.302
Mischievous pranks, Captain?

48:43.377 --> 48:44.469
Yes--

48:44.545 --> 48:47.480
dipping little girls' curls
in inkwells,

48:47.548 --> 48:49.482
stealing apples
from the neighbors' trees,

48:49.550 --> 48:51.745
tying cans on--

48:54.088 --> 48:55.749
Forgive me...

48:55.823 --> 48:57.154
Mr. Spock.

48:57.224 --> 48:59.249
I should have known better.

48:59.326 --> 49:01.260
I shall be delighted,
Captain.
