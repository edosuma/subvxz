00:30.100 --> 00:32.567
We've put an explosive charge
in your head.

00:38.775 --> 00:40.470
Does that sound familiar?

00:43.714 --> 00:45.909
The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?

00:47.017 --> 00:48.644
I gave it to you.

00:48.785 --> 00:51.777
Ethan, where's the Rabbit's Foot?

00:52.456 --> 00:55.653
Wait... What are you saying?
That wasn't it?

00:56.226 --> 00:59.423
- What I gave you, was that...
- I'm going to count to 10.

00:59.529 --> 01:03.590
You're going to tell me
where the Rabbit's Foot is or she dies.

01:11.641 --> 01:14.007
Jules, it's going to be okay.

01:15.178 --> 01:17.772
It's going to be okay.
Do you understand?

01:18.915 --> 01:20.041
One.

01:20.317 --> 01:23.445
You listen to me.
I got exactly what you asked for.

01:23.553 --> 01:25.817
Did you want something else?

01:26.356 --> 01:28.164
If there was a misunderstanding,
I will fix it.

01:28.264 --> 01:30.091
I can get it, whatever you want.

01:30.193 --> 01:31.353
Two.

01:31.862 --> 01:34.888
Listen. Talk to me. We can talk,

01:35.232 --> 01:36.790
like gentlemen.

01:38.702 --> 01:40.727
- Three.
- God!

01:49.913 --> 01:52.541
All right. All right, all right.

01:54.084 --> 01:56.575
I know where the Rabbit's Foot is.

01:57.788 --> 01:58.914
I can help you.

01:59.022 --> 02:01.684
The way you helped me
on the airplane?

02:02.192 --> 02:03.454
That way?

02:03.960 --> 02:06.485
You put the gun down.
I'm not talking to you like this.

02:06.596 --> 02:09.030
That's your choice. Four.

02:10.434 --> 02:11.992
The Rabbit's Foot's in Paris.

02:12.102 --> 02:14.832
You want to know where in Paris?
Then let her go.

02:14.938 --> 02:18.032
- 'Cause you will not...
- It's not in Paris. Five.

02:19.943 --> 02:21.570
I can get it for you.

02:21.678 --> 02:23.558
But you kill her, you do this,
you get nothing.

02:23.680 --> 02:25.910
- Six.
- Are you listening to me?

02:26.016 --> 02:29.179
The only way you're going
to get what you want is for you to...

02:29.286 --> 02:31.379
- Do you think I'm playing?
- Son of a bitch!

02:31.488 --> 02:33.820
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

02:33.924 --> 02:35.755
Where is it? Where the hell is it?

02:35.859 --> 02:37.333
- Look at me.
- Where the hell is it?

02:37.433 --> 02:39.827
- Stay with me.
- Seven! Seven!

02:39.963 --> 02:44.457
I am going to kill you.
I swear to God I'm going to kill you!

02:44.601 --> 02:46.626
- Eight!
- No, please.

02:51.875 --> 02:55.470
Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.

02:57.114 --> 03:00.413
I promise you. I promise you.

03:00.517 --> 03:03.179
- I can figure out how to get whatever...
- Nine.

03:04.354 --> 03:06.481
Listen to me. Listen to me.

03:08.158 --> 03:09.955
I want to help you.

03:10.227 --> 03:12.787
I want to help you get
whatever you want.

03:12.896 --> 03:16.593
But you got to do what's right.
What you know is right.

03:22.839 --> 03:25.467
No. No.

03:29.212 --> 03:30.270
No.

03:30.380 --> 03:31.322
- Ten.
- Don't!

03:31.422 --> 03:32.364
- Ten.
- Don't!

04:10.086 --> 04:12.154
- What are you doing?
- Your brother wants another one.

04:12.254 --> 04:13.956
Oh, God, no.
Ethan, that's what we talked about...

04:14.056 --> 04:16.075
- I'm watching him. He's fine.
- That's how it is with Rick.

04:16.175 --> 04:18.563
He's fine and then suddenly he's naked
and he's hugging everybody.

04:18.663 --> 04:21.495
- I'll take full responsibility for Rick.
- You will? Full?

04:21.598 --> 04:24.089
- Well, mostly full.
- It's a huge responsibility.

04:24.201 --> 04:25.759
It's going well, right?

04:25.869 --> 04:28.167
- It's going really well.
- Yeah.

04:29.306 --> 04:31.001
Julia, your sister's here.

04:31.441 --> 04:33.909
- Give me a hug.
- You look so beautiful.

04:34.044 --> 04:36.103
I don't know about that. So, is this him?

04:36.213 --> 04:38.841
- I hope so.
- Oh, come here. Oh, gosh.

04:39.716 --> 04:41.513
All right. Mom's dying to see you.

04:41.618 --> 04:43.716
I can't believe
you guys came all the way to Virginia.

04:43.816 --> 04:45.030
Like we'd miss your engagement...

04:45.130 --> 04:48.922
When Julia called and told me
that she was getting married,

04:49.059 --> 04:52.028
I had one thought,
that it was just too bad

04:53.096 --> 04:56.395
that Daddy wasn't here
to walk her down the aisle.

04:56.967 --> 04:59.731
And then when Julia told me...
Thanks, Mom.

04:59.836 --> 05:02.304
That Ethan doesn't have
his parents anymore, either,

05:02.405 --> 05:04.202
I got really sad.

05:04.307 --> 05:08.471
But it occurred to me
that this is about starting a new family

05:08.778 --> 05:10.541
and how beautiful that is.

05:10.647 --> 05:13.775
And I just want to say
I am making Julia an aunt,

05:13.917 --> 05:16.715
so I expect the same treatment
very, very soon.

05:16.820 --> 05:18.082
Cheers!

05:23.793 --> 05:25.090
Department of Transportation?

05:25.195 --> 05:27.390
I've been there over 10 years now.
Wow.

05:27.497 --> 05:29.055
What do you do at the DOT?

05:29.165 --> 05:30.689
I study traffic patterns.

05:30.800 --> 05:33.192
You hit the brakes for a second,
just tap them on the freeway,

05:33.292 --> 05:35.257
you can literally track
the ripple effect of that action

05:35.357 --> 05:36.695
across a 200-mile stretch of road,

05:36.806 --> 05:38.103
because traffic has a memory.

05:38.208 --> 05:40.199
It's amazing. It's like a living organism.

05:40.310 --> 05:42.181
Freshen that up for you?
What is it, vodka martini?

05:42.281 --> 05:43.247
Yeah. Thanks.

05:43.347 --> 05:45.247
Ladies, do you need...

05:48.718 --> 05:50.276
- I'd marry him.
- I would, too.

05:50.387 --> 05:53.220
Okay, so, a three-week
heli-boarding honeymoon?

05:53.356 --> 05:56.257
- Okay, you actually get dropped...
- From a helicopter, yeah.

05:56.359 --> 05:58.327
- It's how they met.
- Really?

05:58.428 --> 06:00.293
- Tell her the story.
- There's no story.

06:00.397 --> 06:01.989
It is a good story. Tell the story.

06:02.098 --> 06:05.158
First of all,
no one was ever good enough for Julia.

06:05.268 --> 06:06.496
Oh, here we go.

06:06.603 --> 06:10.539
Not spontaneous enough,
adventurous enough, funny enough...

06:10.674 --> 06:13.579
You know what? No, that's not true.
You make it sound like I've never dated.

06:13.679 --> 06:14.629
No one we liked.

06:14.729 --> 06:16.475
- That is true.
- That is true.

06:30.527 --> 06:33.860
Then she goes and gets in a chopper
that takes off from this lake...

06:33.963 --> 06:36.761
- What was the name of that lake?
- Lake...

06:37.767 --> 06:40.235
Lake Wanaka. Wanaka.

06:41.037 --> 06:42.732
Wanaka. Thank you.

06:43.907 --> 06:45.602
- He heard that?
- How did he hear that?

06:45.709 --> 06:47.733
And the hospital's cool
with you taking three weeks?

06:47.833 --> 06:50.769
Yeah, I'm not the only nurse
employed there, you know.

07:16.439 --> 07:18.737
I'm psyched that you're going
to be my brother, man.

07:18.842 --> 07:19.866
So am I, Rick.

07:19.976 --> 07:21.870
No, it's awesome.
I think it's going to be sick.

07:21.970 --> 07:24.345
Me, too, man.
I just got to get the phone.

07:24.447 --> 07:26.278
- You rock hard.
- Okay.

07:27.350 --> 07:28.408
Hello?

07:28.518 --> 07:30.611
- Is this Mr. Ethan Hunt?
- Yes, it is.

07:30.754 --> 07:33.222
This is Ready-Travel Resort Services.

07:33.323 --> 07:37.953
We'd like to offer you a chance to win
an all-expense-paid trip to Mexico.

07:56.646 --> 07:58.671
We ran out of ice.
I'll be back in 10 minutes.

07:58.782 --> 08:01.046
- Oh, no. Can't somebody else go?
- No, I got it.

08:01.151 --> 08:03.085
I'll be right back. Hi, Betsy.

08:03.186 --> 08:04.517
Thank you.

08:22.205 --> 08:23.638
$1.86.

08:33.216 --> 08:37.015
Thanks for coming.
Can't decide what size Slurpee to get.

08:37.687 --> 08:40.121
I usually go for the 900-ouncer.

08:41.857 --> 08:44.486
How's that party? Sorry I had to call you.

08:44.594 --> 08:46.775
- Yeah, you should have come.
- You should have invited me.

08:46.875 --> 08:49.062
- You know I would have.
- Thanks.

08:51.568 --> 08:54.662
I know we joke about it, but I am always
this close to begging you

08:54.771 --> 08:57.216
to stop training our people
and get your ass back in the field.

08:57.316 --> 09:00.107
But that's not what you do anymore,
and so I respect that choice.

09:00.210 --> 09:04.340
You know I do. Family's everything.

09:06.583 --> 09:08.915
Come on, John. What's going on?

09:12.856 --> 09:14.585
It's Agent Farris.

09:15.191 --> 09:17.216
She was on an operation.

09:17.927 --> 09:21.363
She's disappeared.
Been off-grid 11 hours.

09:23.066 --> 09:27.002
I'm sending in Search and Rescue.
I was hoping you'd want in.

09:31.774 --> 09:34.140
You've got good people for that.

09:37.180 --> 09:39.774
Yeah. Yep, that we do.

09:40.350 --> 09:43.786
Wheels up at sunrise
if you have a change of heart.

09:44.354 --> 09:47.118
Take some pictures of the party for me.

10:06.843 --> 10:08.572
Ethan. Three days ago,

10:08.678 --> 10:12.170
Agent Lindsey Farris was captured
while on a surveillance operation.

10:12.282 --> 10:15.012
This is the man she was tracking.
His name is Owen Davian.

10:15.118 --> 10:16.415
Details are eyes-only,

10:16.519 --> 10:19.283
but I can tell you
that Davian's a black-market trafficker.

10:19.389 --> 10:22.290
Extremely dangerous
and a priority for us.

10:22.659 --> 10:24.354
At 1400 hours today,

10:24.494 --> 10:26.621
a recon satellite ID'd
a caravan of vehicles

10:26.729 --> 10:30.358
with plates matching those known to
have been used by Davian's operatives.

10:30.466 --> 10:33.026
They stopped at a derelict factory
outside Berlin.

10:33.136 --> 10:36.401
It appears they have a hostage.
We believe it's Agent Farris.

10:36.506 --> 10:38.599
Normally we would disavow,

10:38.708 --> 10:40.903
but Lindsey may be the key
to getting us closer to Davian,

10:41.003 --> 10:42.572
and that's a risk we need to take.

10:42.679 --> 10:45.375
Your mission,
should you choose to accept it,

10:45.515 --> 10:48.040
is to find Lindsey and bring her home.

10:48.184 --> 10:50.414
I've already assembled a team.

10:51.254 --> 10:53.415
I have them standing by,
awaiting your word.

10:54.190 --> 10:58.490
This message, let's call it
my excellent engagement gift to you,

10:59.028 --> 11:00.655
will self-destruct in five seconds.

11:00.763 --> 11:03.357
Good luck, Ethan, and thanks again.

11:19.282 --> 11:20.476
Am I ready?

11:32.962 --> 11:35.362
- You okay?
- Yeah.

11:37.233 --> 11:38.495
Yeah.

11:51.748 --> 11:56.082
You know, I'm sorry. I realized
I didn't tell you that the office called

11:56.986 --> 11:59.386
during the party.
I have to go to Houston for a night.

11:59.489 --> 12:03.391
METRO's having
a public transpo conference.

12:06.462 --> 12:09.954
- It's so last-minute.
- I know.

12:36.693 --> 12:38.320
Well, well, well.

12:38.461 --> 12:42.090
Now, if it isn't
Mr. "Those Who Can't Do, Teach"

12:42.198 --> 12:43.722
back in the field.

12:43.833 --> 12:45.994
- What's up, baby?
- Hey, man.

12:46.869 --> 12:50.396
Hey, Ethan, don't worry.
We're going to get the girl.

12:50.940 --> 12:54.671
Or have you been away so long
you've forgotten how good we are?

12:56.012 --> 12:57.604
Welcome back, brother.

13:21.504 --> 13:23.404
Is our truck in place?

13:23.539 --> 13:24.631
Weapons good to go?

13:24.741 --> 13:26.470
- Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

13:26.876 --> 13:28.537
You know I got your six.

13:28.678 --> 13:31.078
Hey, man. That's your job.

13:52.902 --> 13:55.496
Guns one, activated.
Guns two, activated.

13:55.605 --> 13:58.597
Guns three, activated.
Guns four, activated.

13:59.642 --> 14:01.075
Guns ready.

14:07.216 --> 14:08.945
All four guns operational.

14:09.085 --> 14:12.748
They've got men on
the second, third, fourth floors.

14:13.456 --> 14:15.253
I count 14 of them.

14:16.392 --> 14:18.485
Observer, I'm in approach position.

14:18.594 --> 14:20.459
Roger that. Stand by.

14:25.635 --> 14:26.863
Target match.

14:26.969 --> 14:29.870
The prize is on the sixth floor.
Two Tangos with her.

14:30.239 --> 14:31.570
Moving in.

14:48.658 --> 14:50.216
So, Raider One, at some point,

14:50.326 --> 14:52.726
we got to go over
this whole "getting married" thing.

14:52.829 --> 14:54.626
Negative, Observer.

14:54.764 --> 14:57.562
I don't respect you nearly enough
to have that conversation.

14:57.667 --> 14:58.827
You may not respect me,

14:58.935 --> 15:01.062
but for now you're stuck
with my voice in your head.

15:01.170 --> 15:04.071
So, this girl,
what the hell do you see in her anyway?

15:04.173 --> 15:07.336
Who, Julia? You've never met her.

15:07.476 --> 15:10.343
Yeah, and the way things are,
I probably never will.

15:10.546 --> 15:13.515
Lucky for her, right?
That's what you're thinking.

15:14.016 --> 15:15.449
They've got communications gear.

15:15.551 --> 15:18.520
Two Tangos, second floor,
northwest corridor.

15:18.888 --> 15:20.355
Groundhog, that's you.

15:20.456 --> 15:22.194
You need to grab that gear
on the second floor

15:22.294 --> 15:23.556
as soon as we go hot.

15:23.659 --> 15:26.150
Copy that. I'll need two minutes,

15:26.629 --> 15:28.150
which means
you'll need me in one, right?

15:28.250 --> 15:29.688
Yeah, just about.

15:29.832 --> 15:32.130
Raider One,
make a left at the top of the stairs.

15:32.235 --> 15:35.170
The prize should be
at the end of the hall.

15:53.689 --> 15:55.816
Phoenix, I have eye on the prize.

15:55.925 --> 15:57.859
Give her 10 cc's more.

16:02.932 --> 16:05.298
- Call me when she wakes.
- Okay.

16:06.269 --> 16:08.137
We need touchdown in less than three.
Do you copy?

16:08.237 --> 16:09.537
Roger that, I copy.

16:09.672 --> 16:12.698
Please, when do I not copy?
All I do is copy.

16:17.046 --> 16:19.412
Stand by to go live. On my mark.

16:20.516 --> 16:21.642
Three.

16:21.751 --> 16:22.809
Two.

16:22.919 --> 16:24.648
One. Execute.

16:32.395 --> 16:35.558
Warning. Warning.

16:56.252 --> 16:58.220
Raider One, you're clear. Move!

17:05.094 --> 17:08.063
Lindsey. Lindsey.

17:09.765 --> 17:10.992
Ethan?

17:12.601 --> 17:14.626
I'm going to get you home.

17:19.208 --> 17:21.438
Observer, I've got the prize.
Evac in three.

17:21.544 --> 17:22.977
Roger that.

17:29.018 --> 17:32.647
This is adrenaline.
Lindsey, you're going to feel this.

17:49.405 --> 17:51.669
Groundhog, second floor is clear.

17:51.807 --> 17:53.274
On the move!

18:15.231 --> 18:18.200
Observer, we're on the move. Wrap out.

18:18.334 --> 18:20.495
- Evac in 90 seconds.
- Roger that.

18:20.603 --> 18:22.366
Phoenix, get to the LZ now.

18:22.505 --> 18:24.666
Roger, Observer. On my way.

18:41.524 --> 18:43.515
Ethan. I have to talk to you.

18:43.626 --> 18:45.657
- Come on, come on.
- I have to talk to you right now!

18:45.757 --> 18:48.722
Just for you. Turn off your transmitter.

18:49.865 --> 18:51.389
Do it, Ethan!

19:01.877 --> 19:03.071
Ethan!

19:12.121 --> 19:14.419
- Lindsey! Moving!
- Moving!

19:26.669 --> 19:27.761
Mag!

19:29.238 --> 19:30.728
Ready to move.

19:55.297 --> 19:56.662
We evac from here.

19:56.832 --> 19:58.163
Get down!

20:04.540 --> 20:07.065
I'm out. How many rounds you got?

20:09.478 --> 20:10.740
Enough.

20:21.724 --> 20:23.021
Now I'm out.

20:26.395 --> 20:27.828
T minus five, baby.

20:40.409 --> 20:42.434
Lindsey, hold on to me.

21:03.832 --> 21:05.060
Luther!

21:05.868 --> 21:07.165
Rolling!

21:33.229 --> 21:36.221
God! My head! What is that?

21:36.599 --> 21:38.089
- What is...
- Is she okay?

21:38.200 --> 21:40.327
Lindsey! Let's get to the chopper.

21:40.436 --> 21:41.960
Zhen, get rid of the truck.

21:42.071 --> 21:43.402
Let's go!

21:50.045 --> 21:52.775
God! What is that? You can't hear that?

21:53.282 --> 21:55.682
- Oh! God!
- What's wrong with her?

21:57.253 --> 21:58.515
- Let's go!
- We loaded?

21:58.621 --> 22:00.885
Yeah. Let's do it! Move out!

22:06.395 --> 22:08.226
Go, go, go, go, go!

22:29.985 --> 22:31.748
- Son of a bitch.
- No!

22:31.887 --> 22:35.220
Guys, we got company.
I'm going to try and lose them.

22:35.324 --> 22:36.848
Hurts so much.

22:38.060 --> 22:40.290
Turn it off. Please.

22:57.112 --> 22:58.739
Please, Ethan.

23:09.792 --> 23:12.056
Guys, their missiles are hot!

23:16.799 --> 23:18.562
Incoming! Hold on.

23:29.978 --> 23:32.640
Okay. That was lucky.
We only get one of those.

23:41.857 --> 23:44.018
Do we have a defibrillator?

23:46.195 --> 23:47.958
Ethan, turn it off!

23:48.464 --> 23:49.931
Bring it on!

23:52.534 --> 23:55.230
Ethan! What is it?
Did they put something in my head?

23:55.337 --> 23:57.271
They injected you
with a time-release charge.

23:57.373 --> 23:59.040
- Do you remember that?
- No. Time-release...

23:59.140 --> 24:00.391
An explosive. They've activated it.

24:00.491 --> 24:02.077
It's gonna detonate
unless we fry the charge,

24:02.177 --> 24:03.441
- which is what we're gonna do.
- No, Ethan.

24:03.541 --> 24:04.749
Zap her like that, you'll stop her heart.

24:04.849 --> 24:07.273
Then I'll zap her again
and bring her back.

24:07.383 --> 24:08.475
Do it!

24:08.584 --> 24:10.677
Guys! They're firing another one!

24:18.494 --> 24:20.121
- Ethan!
- Zhen!

24:20.229 --> 24:22.697
Zhen, hold on. Hold on, hold on!

24:45.721 --> 24:47.416
- I want you to set it for 150.
- 150.

24:47.523 --> 24:49.511
Lindsey, I'm gonna short out
the explosive in your head.

24:49.611 --> 24:51.326
- You're gonna be okay.
- It'll need 30 seconds.

24:52.594 --> 24:53.891
Damn it.

24:54.396 --> 24:56.193
- Twenty-five seconds!
- Come on.

24:56.298 --> 24:58.095
We're almost there.

25:01.703 --> 25:03.671
- They have us locked.
- Twenty seconds.

25:05.374 --> 25:06.602
Hold on.

25:23.759 --> 25:24.953
I got them!

25:25.093 --> 25:27.527
- Ten seconds.
- Almost there. Almost there.

25:27.729 --> 25:29.219
Give me the paddles.

25:29.331 --> 25:31.799
Ethan. Thank you.

26:06.869 --> 26:08.097
Shit.

26:45.274 --> 26:46.332
Hey.

26:48.110 --> 26:49.236
Hey.

26:56.852 --> 26:58.342
How did it go?

27:01.290 --> 27:04.851
I'm sorry. Fine. I'm sorry.

27:05.494 --> 27:07.086
I'm just tired.

27:36.058 --> 27:38.686
I read your training brief
on Agent Farris.

27:38.827 --> 27:41.227
The words you used were
"beyond capable."

27:41.363 --> 27:42.728
That still stand, Mr. Hunt?

27:42.831 --> 27:45.163
- Mr. Brassel...
- Does it stand?

27:45.934 --> 27:47.128
Yes, sir, it does.

27:47.235 --> 27:50.466
Because we've got a corpse downstairs
that says otherwise.

27:50.572 --> 27:52.233
Killed by a detonator

27:52.374 --> 27:55.571
implanted in her skull
through the nasal cavity.

27:56.745 --> 27:59.908
Mr. Brassel, it's unacceptable to judge
Agent Farris' competence based...

28:00.015 --> 28:02.108
It's unacceptable
that chocolate makes you fat,

28:02.217 --> 28:04.242
but I've eaten my share.
And guess what?

28:04.353 --> 28:06.685
Now, I approved Agent Farris'
surveillance op

28:06.788 --> 28:08.915
based on your evaluations, Mr. Hunt,

28:09.057 --> 28:11.457
of a woman
who allowed herself to be captured.

28:11.560 --> 28:14.529
So you go to recover her.
You encounter a dozen men.

28:14.630 --> 28:16.291
You don't grab any of them?

28:16.398 --> 28:20.027
Our objective, Mr. Brassel,
was to recover Agent Farris.

28:20.969 --> 28:23.173
Davian employs a cellular structure
at his organization.

28:23.273 --> 28:25.312
The men there
more than likely had no information...

28:25.412 --> 28:28.399
Who's drawing these conclusions?
Is it you?

28:28.543 --> 28:31.671
- I am, sir. Based upon...
- I'm not on you yet.

28:32.414 --> 28:34.882
You allowed Farris
to board your chopper without a scan.

28:34.983 --> 28:37.023
That explosive device
could have taken you all out.

28:37.152 --> 28:41.612
There is one reason that you are sitting
here before me today, and that is luck.

28:41.757 --> 28:46.023
Because your operation was
poorly conceived and executed worse.

28:46.128 --> 28:48.460
- Two laptops were recovered...
- I'm aware of that.

28:48.563 --> 28:49.894
We've talked to Tech Services.

28:49.998 --> 28:52.364
They doubt
if they can reconstitute the drives.

28:52.467 --> 28:55.732
"Crispy," I believe,
is what they called them. Worthless.

28:55.837 --> 28:58.135
Mr. Brassel,
as Operation Manager of this office,

28:58.240 --> 28:59.717
- I have the authority...
- Excuse me.

28:59.817 --> 29:02.801
Did you just throw a title at me,
Mr. Musgrave?

29:02.944 --> 29:06.277
I don't care if your daddy plays golf
with the President.

29:06.415 --> 29:09.475
This is Intelligence.
So far I haven't seen any.

29:09.618 --> 29:12.746
You think this op was worth the risk,
Mr. Hunt.

29:13.689 --> 29:16.283
What do you know about Owen Davian?

29:17.359 --> 29:19.884
He was the one
who brought gas centrifuge technology

29:19.995 --> 29:22.054
to Korea from Pakistan.

29:22.164 --> 29:26.328
He was also the man who sold Toxin
Five to the Armahad Republic Jihad.

29:26.768 --> 29:31.000
He is a man who provides,
provides, provides!

29:32.340 --> 29:36.003
And he remains invisible.
He's a goddamn invisible man.

29:36.144 --> 29:39.079
Wells, not Ellison,
in case you want to be cute again.

29:39.181 --> 29:40.944
We can't find him.

29:42.117 --> 29:45.518
He knows it. It's emboldened him.

29:46.855 --> 29:49.500
I've been trying to bring Davian down
since the day that I got here.

29:49.600 --> 29:50.785
Do you know what I've got for it?

29:50.885 --> 29:53.103
It's never been confirmed
the Toxin Five theft was Davian.

29:53.203 --> 29:57.188
Mr. Musgrave, please don't interrupt me
when I'm asking rhetorical questions.

29:57.299 --> 29:59.392
Your operation has achieved one thing.

29:59.501 --> 30:02.698
You have reminded Davian
that he is winning.

30:04.206 --> 30:07.198
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go inform Mr. And Mrs. Farris

30:07.309 --> 30:11.177
that their baby girl was killed
in a head-on collision on l-95.

30:13.248 --> 30:15.773
I stand here today deeply saddened

30:16.084 --> 30:18.848
by the death of one of God's children,

30:19.387 --> 30:21.685
Lindsey Elizabeth Farris.

30:22.424 --> 30:27.225
It is always startling when the Lord
takes one of our young so unexpectedly.

30:28.363 --> 30:33.391
Be aggressive. Come on. Stay focused.
Keep your knees bent. Good. Good.

30:33.535 --> 30:35.594
Now, to fire the lock,
the extractor has to be...

30:35.704 --> 30:37.651
That bag's not going to hit you back.
Hit harder.

30:37.751 --> 30:40.201
Don't rely on your sights.
Keep your eyes dead on the target...

30:40.301 --> 30:41.834
Attack me. Come on.

30:41.943 --> 30:45.071
Don't ever release the firing pin
unless the extractor's...

30:45.180 --> 30:47.239
Good. There you go. Good.

30:47.582 --> 30:51.848
Identify the target. Point and shoot.
It's very simple. You point and shoot.

30:51.987 --> 30:53.045
Stay focused.

30:53.155 --> 30:56.147
Miss Farris, you know
how many recruits I've trained.

30:56.258 --> 30:58.123
I'm proud to say that you are the first

30:58.226 --> 31:00.854
that I've recommended
for active field duty.

31:00.996 --> 31:02.327
Congratulations.

31:02.430 --> 31:03.829
Am I ready?

31:10.038 --> 31:11.130
Yes?

31:11.540 --> 31:13.303
Is this Mr. Kelvin?

31:15.944 --> 31:17.707
Yes. Who is this?

31:18.280 --> 31:20.145
I'm calling from Norfolk Mail Service.

31:20.248 --> 31:22.682
Lindsey Farris
rents a post office box here.

31:22.784 --> 31:24.411
She sent you a piece of mail from Berlin

31:24.519 --> 31:26.419
and asked us to call you
when it arrived.

31:26.521 --> 31:28.386
It came this morning.

31:32.727 --> 31:34.092
Thank you.

31:37.899 --> 31:39.992
- This right here.
- Thanks.

31:57.419 --> 31:58.687
It's a microdot.

31:58.820 --> 32:01.118
A microdot with nothing on it.
This is unusual.

32:01.223 --> 32:03.214
Lindsey wouldn't send me
a blank microdot.

32:03.325 --> 32:04.885
I'm telling you, man, there's no image.

32:04.993 --> 32:06.521
Then you're not looking
in the right place.

32:06.621 --> 32:07.902
Where the hell am I supposed to look?

32:08.002 --> 32:09.650
There's not much square footage
to this thing.

32:09.750 --> 32:11.142
Why would Lindsey send me
a blank microdot?

32:11.242 --> 32:12.984
I don't know.
Why would Lindsey send you anything?

32:13.084 --> 32:15.630
You were her instructor,
not her handler.

32:16.338 --> 32:19.364
Listen, man.
I don't mean to cross the line,

32:20.175 --> 32:23.406
but was there something going on
between you two?

32:23.511 --> 32:25.206
You and Lindsey.

32:25.747 --> 32:28.238
Lindsey was like my little sister.

32:28.817 --> 32:30.284
And you never

32:31.319 --> 32:34.117
slept with your little sister, right?

32:37.158 --> 32:39.888
Hey, brother, if I don't ask you, who will?

32:39.995 --> 32:42.486
Maybe it's magnetic. The microdot.

32:43.331 --> 32:44.992
Well, that's old school.

32:45.133 --> 32:48.591
If she was in a hurry and only had
access to black-market gear, maybe.

32:48.703 --> 32:51.001
- Could you get the tools to read it?
- I might know a guy.

32:51.101 --> 32:53.439
- Magnetic means encrypted.
- Yeah, I know that.

32:53.541 --> 32:56.203
Yeah. Be right there.

32:56.578 --> 32:59.513
The thing about Lindsey is
she was brand-new.

32:59.648 --> 33:02.776
She was sweet.
Remember when you were sweet?

33:02.884 --> 33:06.411
- Can you remember that far back?
- Yeah, well, barely.

33:06.821 --> 33:10.279
In Germany,
you asked me what it is I see in Julia.

33:10.792 --> 33:13.818
What I see in Julia is life before all this.

33:14.629 --> 33:16.290
And it's good.

33:18.633 --> 33:20.066
Benji, what have you got?

33:20.168 --> 33:22.398
Well, these hard drive platters
are just fried.

33:22.504 --> 33:24.288
- Yeah.
- You know, they made a mess of them.

33:24.388 --> 33:26.073
It's just like...
There's holes in them and stuff.

33:26.173 --> 33:27.905
And it's got scorched
all the way through. And then...

33:28.005 --> 33:29.540
Look, this one's got
a hole in it and stuff.

33:29.640 --> 33:30.998
I can't believe. I can't even look at it.

33:31.098 --> 33:33.107
- Benji. Did you recover anything?
- Yes. Yes.

33:33.214 --> 33:36.125
Despite the aforementioned conditions
of the hard drive you brought back,

33:36.225 --> 33:40.779
I managed to recover
portions of two dozen e-mail files.

33:40.889 --> 33:42.413
Also made what I believe to be

33:42.524 --> 33:45.493
a thoroughly
promotion-worthy breakthrough.

33:46.361 --> 33:49.387
Your Mr. Davian is going
to arrive in Rome the day after tomorrow

33:49.497 --> 33:52.523
and attend a function
at one Vatican City.

33:52.667 --> 33:54.794
What the hell is Davian
doing at the Vatican?

33:54.903 --> 33:56.928
It's all got to do with the "Rabbit's Foot."

33:57.038 --> 33:58.130
Rabbit's Foot?

33:58.239 --> 34:00.010
Yeah, well,
I'm assuming it's like a code word

34:00.110 --> 34:02.249
for something he's about to sell
to an unspecified buyer,

34:02.349 --> 34:05.872
for $850 million, by the way.
Or maybe it's not a code word.

34:06.014 --> 34:08.676
Maybe it's just a really,
really expensive bunny appendage.

34:08.783 --> 34:10.306
You have no idea what it is?

34:10.418 --> 34:13.148
It's interesting. I used to have
this professor at Oxford, okay?

34:13.254 --> 34:16.348
Dr. Wickham, his name was,
and he was like this massive, fat guy.

34:16.458 --> 34:18.824
You know, huge, big guy.
We used to call him...

34:18.927 --> 34:21.011
You know... Well, I won't tell you
what we used to call him.

34:21.110 --> 34:23.525
He taught biomolecular kinetics
and cellular dynamics,

34:23.630 --> 34:25.656
and he used to sort of
scare the underclassmen

34:25.766 --> 34:28.929
with this story about how the world
would eventually be eviscerated

34:29.036 --> 34:30.368
by technology.

34:30.472 --> 34:33.929
You see, it was inevitable
that a compound would be created,

34:34.074 --> 34:36.565
which he referred to as the "Anti-God."

34:36.710 --> 34:38.949
It was like an accelerated mutator,
a sort of, you know,

34:39.049 --> 34:42.107
like an unstoppable force
of destructive power

34:42.250 --> 34:43.978
that would just lay waste to everything.

34:44.085 --> 34:46.280
To buildings and parks
and streets and children

34:46.388 --> 34:48.879
and ice cream parlors, you know?

34:49.090 --> 34:51.853
So whenever I see, like,
a rogue organization,

34:51.960 --> 34:55.623
willing to spend this amount of money
on a mystery tech,

34:56.264 --> 34:59.097
I always assume it's the Anti-God.

35:00.802 --> 35:03.464
End-of-the-world kind of stuff,
you know?

35:05.206 --> 35:08.369
But, no, I don't have any idea what it is.
I was just speculating.

35:08.476 --> 35:10.842
- Did you brief Musgrave on this?
- Who, me? No, not yet.

35:10.945 --> 35:12.606
- Good. Don't.
- What?

35:12.747 --> 35:14.655
- Don't tell anyone about this.
- This took me ages.

35:14.755 --> 35:16.143
If something goes wrong
with the operation,

35:16.243 --> 35:18.518
I want Musgrave to have deniability.

35:18.620 --> 35:21.214
- That's great work, Benji.
- What operation?

35:22.557 --> 35:24.491
That look in your eye
is a pain in my ass.

35:24.592 --> 35:26.457
You know that, right?

35:27.662 --> 35:30.426
Any available resident to Pediatrics.

35:31.166 --> 35:33.828
Any available resident to Pediatrics.

35:35.737 --> 35:38.501
Rehabilitative Care, call the pharmacy.

35:40.308 --> 35:42.299
Rehabilitative Care, call the...

35:43.244 --> 35:45.303
I have to go away again.

35:46.047 --> 35:49.778
On business. Two days.

35:51.186 --> 35:52.483
Two days?

35:53.588 --> 35:54.714
Yeah.

36:01.362 --> 36:03.330
Ethan, what's going on?

36:04.999 --> 36:07.524
I keep thinking you just need time

36:10.038 --> 36:12.871
to tell me whatever it is that it's...

36:16.878 --> 36:19.472
But nothing in my mind makes sense.

36:22.183 --> 36:23.343
Yeah.

36:27.388 --> 36:28.878
What's wrong?

36:36.865 --> 36:39.129
What are you not telling me?

37:05.793 --> 37:08.057
I need to ask you for something.

37:08.196 --> 37:10.596
And it's the most...

37:20.241 --> 37:21.868
I need you to trust me.

37:24.579 --> 37:26.444
Of course I trust you.

37:30.919 --> 37:34.514
Am I ever going to be able
to understand what this is?

37:37.959 --> 37:39.950
I need you to trust me.

37:46.134 --> 37:47.260
Yes.

37:48.636 --> 37:50.103
I trust you.

37:53.274 --> 37:54.468
Is it...

37:55.510 --> 37:57.273
Tell me it's real.

38:02.784 --> 38:04.149
I mean us.

38:05.753 --> 38:07.448
Tell me it's real.

38:10.258 --> 38:11.623
Follow me.

38:13.094 --> 38:14.493
The vows you're about to take

38:14.596 --> 38:18.157
are not to be taken
without careful thought and prayer.

38:19.367 --> 38:23.235
This love is not to be diminished
by difficult circumstances

38:23.338 --> 38:26.432
and it is only to be dissolved by death.

38:28.443 --> 38:30.308
Do you have the rings?

38:30.612 --> 38:31.738
Yeah.

38:46.194 --> 38:47.855
Repeat after me.

38:54.669 --> 38:56.933
I, Julia Anne Meade...

38:58.139 --> 39:01.199
"I, Julia Anne Meade..."

39:01.709 --> 39:04.769
...hereby take Ethan Matthew Hunt...

39:05.747 --> 39:08.477
"...hereby take Ethan Matthew Hunt..."

39:08.683 --> 39:11.277
...to be my lawfully wedded husband.

39:11.586 --> 39:14.350
"...to be my lawfully wedded husband."

39:31.873 --> 39:33.633
Tomorrow may be the only time
we can predict

39:33.775 --> 39:35.333
where Owen Davian is going to be.

39:35.443 --> 39:36.967
Charity event. Vatican City.

39:37.078 --> 39:40.070
Our mission is to get in
and kidnap Davian.

39:40.214 --> 39:42.580
I don't know why he's so happy.

39:42.917 --> 39:46.182
I did remind him
that the Vatican is the Vatican.

39:46.521 --> 39:50.389
A 109-acre sovereign state
in the middle of Rome,

39:50.525 --> 39:54.086
surrounded by a 60-foot wall,
which is monitored 24/7,

39:54.228 --> 39:56.662
with over 200 CCTV cameras.

39:57.899 --> 40:00.265
That's not even
what makes it a challenge.

40:00.368 --> 40:04.566
Getting Davian is good.
But getting his buyers is even better.

40:05.239 --> 40:08.731
If they realize he's been grabbed,
they'll disappear.

40:08.876 --> 40:10.901
I'm sorry, what are you saying?

40:11.045 --> 40:12.342
No matter how we grab Davian,

40:12.447 --> 40:14.278
his clients are gonna know
he's been taken.

40:14.382 --> 40:17.215
No, they won't. Access point is here.

40:17.585 --> 40:20.611
It's a one-way street
adjacent to the Vatican wall.

40:20.755 --> 40:23.918
I'll need 30 seconds.
And we'll need a truck.

41:01.028 --> 41:02.673
Now we've pissed off
every Italian in Rome,

41:02.773 --> 41:03.769
go do what you got to do.

41:03.869 --> 41:06.231
- Don't forget the smoke.
- Yeah.

41:48.342 --> 41:49.639
"Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall."

43:03.846 --> 43:06.508
Alpha team, this is Bravo.
Right on schedule.

43:07.383 --> 43:09.442
We should have breach in 60.

43:09.552 --> 43:12.180
Roger that. Charlie team, report.

43:12.789 --> 43:14.814
Well, I don't have anything
to report, really.

43:18.127 --> 43:20.095
Except I think I should be right on time.

43:20.196 --> 43:21.254
We'll be waiting for you.

43:21.364 --> 43:24.094
- ETA two minutes.
- Roger that.

43:55.698 --> 43:57.378
Charlie team, did you fire the tracer yet?

43:58.701 --> 44:00.032
Stand by.

44:14.517 --> 44:16.985
Firing the tracer. Now.

44:22.792 --> 44:25.920
Alpha, I'm in. T minus two minutes.

44:26.062 --> 44:27.427
Roger that.

44:30.233 --> 44:31.427
Charlie team, I see you.

44:31.934 --> 44:34.300
I'm looping the security feed.
Stand by to move.

44:34.403 --> 44:35.768
Roger that.

44:37.540 --> 44:38.939
Video is looped. Go.

44:53.055 --> 44:55.387
Alpha team,
catacomb video taken care of?

44:55.491 --> 44:57.516
Taken care of. We're good to go.

45:05.968 --> 45:09.369
- Delta team, do you copy?
- All I do is copy.

45:09.639 --> 45:12.972
That's funny.
Get ready to move into position.

45:13.109 --> 45:15.543
- I'm already there.
- Really?

45:18.180 --> 45:19.738
ETA 30 seconds.

45:19.849 --> 45:21.407
See you in 30.

45:30.960 --> 45:32.427
Alpha team moving into position.

45:32.528 --> 45:34.291
Bravo standing by for transmission.

45:36.365 --> 45:37.457
Transmitting.

45:40.870 --> 45:42.132
Got you.

45:56.886 --> 45:58.353
Miss Onia Demea.

45:58.588 --> 46:01.056
I should be on the list. Thank you.

46:02.191 --> 46:03.502
I'm sorry. Your name is not here.

46:03.602 --> 46:05.424
There must be some mistake.

46:14.403 --> 46:15.427
Miss Demea?

46:16.739 --> 46:17.763
Just a minute.

46:54.110 --> 46:55.543
She made it.

47:17.099 --> 47:18.532
We have a photo opportunity.

47:19.035 --> 47:21.663
Just give me the word. I'm standing by.

47:21.771 --> 47:23.398
Delta, ready for upload.

47:40.389 --> 47:42.448
Delta team, download good.

47:53.669 --> 47:56.365
Listen, man, I didn't mean to be
so cavalier the other day

47:56.472 --> 47:57.996
about you getting engaged.

47:58.107 --> 48:00.735
I know that. Thanks.

48:03.679 --> 48:06.807
But a normal relationship
isn't viable for people like us.

48:06.916 --> 48:09.714
- I don't agree with that.
- Then I'm smarter than you.

48:09.819 --> 48:12.310
I'm going up. I agree with Luther.

48:12.455 --> 48:16.391
We can't have real relationships.
But you see, I love that.

48:41.350 --> 48:43.545
Twenty-three months.
That's as long as it'll last

48:43.652 --> 48:46.621
when you got the baggage we do
and the lifestyle we got.

48:46.722 --> 48:48.656
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

48:49.725 --> 48:52.523
Look at me.
I know what I'm talking about.

48:52.661 --> 48:55.596
And you know
I know what I'm talking about.

49:07.810 --> 49:09.141
Wait here.

49:31.167 --> 49:32.514
Davian just picked up a briefcase.

49:32.614 --> 49:34.489
We're going to have to
move sooner than we thought.

49:34.589 --> 49:38.270
- Can you identify who made the drop?
- Negative. How close are you guys?

49:38.374 --> 49:40.433
We're just printing now.

49:59.728 --> 50:01.992
I'm not proud of it.
I'm not happy about it,

50:02.097 --> 50:03.928
but I've lived with women a few times,

50:04.033 --> 50:06.126
and it doesn't ever make it to two years.

50:06.235 --> 50:07.998
- You can't.
- Thanks for the advice,

50:08.103 --> 50:10.628
but it's different for me
than it is for you, you know?

50:10.739 --> 50:12.730
- I'm not in the field anymore.
- Oh, okay.

50:12.842 --> 50:15.037
Here's a retirement present.

50:18.180 --> 50:21.775
In our job, there's always going to be
something between you and a woman.

50:21.884 --> 50:23.044
Always.

50:23.185 --> 50:25.380
- Luther, listen.
- Dishonesty.

50:25.521 --> 50:28.183
A dishonesty that poisons everything.

50:28.290 --> 50:29.951
I think I need to tell you something...

50:30.059 --> 50:32.926
Stop talking. This isn't about you, Ethan.

50:33.629 --> 50:37.588
And whoever this girl is, you're going to
end up messing up her life, too.

50:37.733 --> 50:39.166
Don't do it.

50:40.569 --> 50:43.265
Jules and I got married two days ago.

50:45.407 --> 50:47.034
Congratulations.

50:48.043 --> 50:50.443
Thanks. Thanks.

50:55.217 --> 50:58.050
- He's walking. I'm going in.
- Roger that.

50:59.221 --> 51:00.745
I'm on my way.

51:04.927 --> 51:07.293
Ma'am. I need you to step back.

51:07.429 --> 51:09.329
No. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

51:09.431 --> 51:11.831
I always spill red wine
on my white custom-made shirt.

51:11.934 --> 51:15.233
- Okay. Step back.
- It's fine. It's fine. Bathroom.

51:17.973 --> 51:19.406
Tell me you're on your way.

51:19.508 --> 51:21.203
I'm on the move.

51:30.286 --> 51:31.412
Move it. Come on.

51:34.990 --> 51:36.981
His bodyguards
are checking out the bathroom.

51:37.693 --> 51:39.388
I'm almost there.

52:20.202 --> 52:21.328
He's going in.

52:48.731 --> 52:51.291
Quiet. Read this.

52:51.433 --> 52:52.695
Slowly.

52:54.670 --> 52:55.898
Read it.

52:57.740 --> 53:01.073
"The pleasure of Buzby's company

53:01.577 --> 53:03.477
"is what I most enjoy.

53:04.680 --> 53:07.376
"He put a tack on Miss Yancy's chair

53:08.217 --> 53:10.845
"when she called him a horrible boy.

53:11.186 --> 53:14.246
"At the end of the month
he was flinging two kittens

53:14.390 --> 53:16.119
"across the width of the room.

53:16.225 --> 53:19.092
"I count on his schemes to reveal the..."

53:19.228 --> 53:21.560
- What the hell is this?
- Finish.

53:23.732 --> 53:25.393
Alpha, you're about to have a visitor.

53:25.868 --> 53:26.994
Finish!

53:27.102 --> 53:28.694
"...a way to escape my gloom."

53:28.804 --> 53:30.066
Got it.

53:36.245 --> 53:38.213
Alpha, do you copy?
The guard's on his way.

53:38.313 --> 53:39.837
Delta, stall him. I need more time.

53:39.948 --> 53:42.917
It's too late for that. He's in the hallway.

53:51.460 --> 53:52.590
Sir, is everything all right?

53:52.690 --> 53:55.186
Everything is not all right.
Voice mask is still compiling.

53:55.297 --> 53:56.958
I need 30 seconds.

54:00.936 --> 54:02.028
Sir?

54:09.845 --> 54:10.937
Sir?

54:18.787 --> 54:19.981
Six seconds, I'm uploading.

54:22.458 --> 54:23.555
- A way to escape my gloom.
- Okay. Go.

54:23.655 --> 54:24.819
- A way to escape my gloom.
- Okay. Go.

54:25.994 --> 54:27.985
I'm fine. Wait outside.

54:42.678 --> 54:44.236
See you in the sewer.

54:52.054 --> 54:55.353
- She's sorry about your shirt.
- That's no problem.

54:58.694 --> 55:02.027
Her hotel has laundry service,
and she'll happily take care of it.

55:02.131 --> 55:03.428
You want to wash my shirt?

55:03.532 --> 55:06.052
What are we going to do
while we're waiting in your hotel room,

55:06.168 --> 55:07.465
and I'm not wearing my shirt?

55:11.673 --> 55:13.538
She'll think of something.

55:14.510 --> 55:16.102
She would like to drive.

55:16.211 --> 55:17.735
Follow me to the hotel.

55:17.846 --> 55:19.643
Sir, would you like us
to watch the case?

55:19.748 --> 55:20.806
No.

55:22.184 --> 55:24.015
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

56:02.424 --> 56:04.892
- What's up?
- Nothing. What's up with you?

56:05.027 --> 56:06.255
Nothing.

56:24.479 --> 56:26.003
Blow the car.

56:28.116 --> 56:30.107
Oh. It's such a nice car.

56:30.252 --> 56:32.447
And yet, do it.

56:54.610 --> 56:56.840
...covered some hot spots
over in central Eurasia.

56:56.945 --> 56:59.914
I direct your attention
to the third satellite image in the series

57:00.015 --> 57:01.642
forwarded to us by our friends...

57:01.750 --> 57:03.183
Mr. Musgrave to see you.

57:03.285 --> 57:04.718
Send him in.

57:06.822 --> 57:10.553
Ethan Hunt and his team
just grabbed Owen Davian in Rome.

57:10.692 --> 57:14.093
They're headed back now.
I thought you should know.

57:14.763 --> 57:16.993
You were aware of this operation?

57:19.134 --> 57:20.499
Yes, I was.

57:21.470 --> 57:23.062
Then good work.

57:26.808 --> 57:28.139
Thank you.

58:02.411 --> 58:04.436
You're dead, Mr. Davian.

58:09.184 --> 58:11.015
There were witnesses.

58:14.389 --> 58:16.619
That was you in the bathroom.

58:16.725 --> 58:18.454
Now, you're going to tell us everything.

58:18.560 --> 58:21.085
Every buyer you've worked with.
Every organization.

58:21.196 --> 58:22.458
What the hell is your name?

58:22.564 --> 58:24.691
Names, contacts, inventory lists.

58:24.833 --> 58:27.666
You have a wife, girlfriend?

58:30.072 --> 58:31.972
It's up to you how this goes.

58:32.074 --> 58:34.975
Because you know
what I'm going to do next?

58:35.077 --> 58:37.409
I'm going to find her, whoever she is,

58:37.546 --> 58:40.811
I'm going to find her,
and I'm going to hurt her.

58:44.519 --> 58:46.453
You were apprehended carrying details

58:46.555 --> 58:49.581
of the location of something
code named the Rabbit's Foot.

58:49.691 --> 58:53.388
I'm going to make her bleed, and cry,
and call out your name.

58:53.528 --> 58:57.225
And you're not going to be
able to do shit. You know why?

58:58.767 --> 58:59.825
What is the Rabbit's Foot?

58:59.935 --> 59:02.199
Because you're going to be
this close to dead.

59:02.304 --> 59:03.464
And who is the buyer?

59:03.572 --> 59:07.064
And then I'm going to kill you
right in front of her.

59:08.276 --> 59:10.517
- I'm going to ask you one more time.
- What's your name?

59:10.617 --> 59:12.173
- What is the Rabbit's Foot?
- Who are you?

59:12.273 --> 59:13.244
And who is the buyer?

59:13.344 --> 59:15.681
You don't have any idea
what the hell is going on, do you?

59:15.784 --> 59:20.221
I mean, you saw what I did to your
little blonde friend at the factory, right?

59:23.291 --> 59:25.725
Well, that was nothing. That was

59:27.829 --> 59:28.955
fun.

59:33.001 --> 59:34.468
That was fun.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:07.593
What is the Rabbit's Foot?

01:00:14.509 --> 01:00:17.000
- Ethan!
- What is the Rabbit's Foot?

01:00:17.512 --> 01:00:18.911
Ethan, stop!

01:00:19.014 --> 01:00:20.447
What is it?

01:00:21.683 --> 01:00:23.150
Don't do it!

01:00:23.852 --> 01:00:26.343
- Ethan!
- What is the Rabbit's Foot?

01:00:28.457 --> 01:00:29.617
You tell me!

01:00:29.724 --> 01:00:31.385
Ethan, stop! Don't do it.

01:00:31.493 --> 01:00:33.654
This isn't you, man! This isn't you!

01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:36.525
We can use him, Ethan! You know that!

01:00:42.971 --> 01:00:44.939
No, Ethan! Don't do it!

01:00:46.675 --> 01:00:48.142
Please, stop!

01:01:19.341 --> 01:01:21.002
What I'm selling,

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:23.701
and who I'm selling to,

01:01:26.381 --> 01:01:29.578
is the last thing
you should be concerned about,

01:01:32.087 --> 01:01:33.315
Ethan.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.808
Ethan, we got it. Lindsey's microdot.

01:02:35.317 --> 01:02:37.080
It's a video file.

01:02:41.423 --> 01:02:44.483
Ethan, I don't know what they've
told you. I don't know what you think.

01:02:44.593 --> 01:02:46.185
Just listen to me.

01:02:46.294 --> 01:02:48.819
Brassel sent me to Germany
to surveil an exchange,

01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:50.955
to ID a man named Owen Davian.

01:02:51.099 --> 01:02:53.829
I tagged his phone,
and I intercepted a transmission.

01:02:53.935 --> 01:02:57.302
I traced the call through the
IMF network, and this is what came up.

01:02:57.405 --> 01:03:00.465
The call to Davian
came from Brassel's office.

01:03:01.343 --> 01:03:04.244
It's Brassel.
I think he's working with Davian.

01:03:04.346 --> 01:03:06.314
I think I'm being set up...

01:03:20.567 --> 01:03:21.829
Ethan!

01:03:54.496 --> 01:03:55.986
You all right?

01:04:03.605 --> 01:04:05.539
Someone call for help!

01:04:06.608 --> 01:04:08.906
Does anyone have a cell phone?

01:04:42.444 --> 01:04:44.241
Everybody, get down!

01:04:44.813 --> 01:04:48.112
Get down! Get down, get down!
Everybody, get down!

01:05:04.433 --> 01:05:06.901
- There's a woman down.
- I see her.

01:05:24.419 --> 01:05:26.717
Get down! Get down! Stay down!

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:30.584
Everybody, get down! Get down!
Stay down!

01:05:30.692 --> 01:05:32.057
Get down!

01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:36.658
Open up!

01:05:36.798 --> 01:05:39.096
Open up! I need the prisoner!

01:05:55.217 --> 01:05:56.616
Oh, my God!

01:05:57.319 --> 01:05:59.719
It's really bleeding.
Don't leave me, okay?

01:05:59.821 --> 01:06:01.755
Don't worry. I'm right here.

01:06:01.857 --> 01:06:04.189
Ethan, there's a G36 in the truck!

01:06:04.326 --> 01:06:05.350
I know! I know!

01:06:35.791 --> 01:06:38.658
Turn the drone around.
There's an IMF agent in the truck.

01:06:46.568 --> 01:06:48.798
Ethan! Get out of the truck!

01:06:56.244 --> 01:06:57.677
Ethan, move!

01:09:08.143 --> 01:09:10.542
- Hello?
- Rick, this is Ethan. Is Julia home?

01:09:10.645 --> 01:09:13.738
Hey, man. Look, I hope you're not mad
I'm here. It's just...

01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:15.158
Rick, I'm not mad. Is Julia home?

01:09:15.259 --> 01:09:17.170
I tried her cell phone,
and there was no answer.

01:09:17.752 --> 01:09:21.346
No. Sorry.
Hey, did your friend find you?

01:09:23.158 --> 01:09:24.557
Which friend?

01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:27.287
I don't know. Just some English guy.

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:30.962
Rick, what did you tell him?

01:09:31.066 --> 01:09:33.933
Look, it's all good, man.
I told him I didn't know where you were,

01:09:34.035 --> 01:09:37.493
and Julia might, and he should
just try her at the hospital.

01:09:39.207 --> 01:09:40.299
Hello?

01:09:46.413 --> 01:09:49.174
- All right, see you tomorrow, Sally.
- All right. Good night, honey.

01:09:56.591 --> 01:09:58.991
Hi. It's Julia.
Please leave me a message...

01:10:06.568 --> 01:10:10.527
...at 4:00 today, the Chesapeake Bay
Bridge is closed in both directions.

01:10:10.639 --> 01:10:12.470
- Sixth floor.
- Sally, this is Ethan.

01:10:12.574 --> 01:10:14.633
- I need to talk to Julia.
- Hey, honey.

01:10:14.743 --> 01:10:16.503
She just went downstairs.
I'll transfer you.

01:10:37.432 --> 01:10:38.626
Damn it!

01:10:39.501 --> 01:10:40.559
Excuse me.

01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:43.053
I was wondering if you knew
where I might find this patient.

01:10:43.153 --> 01:10:45.732
Probably not. But I'll know who can.

01:10:51.012 --> 01:10:52.479
What's that?

01:11:07.796 --> 01:11:09.730
Sally. Where's Julia?

01:11:10.265 --> 01:11:12.631
- Where's Julia?
- I think she left.

01:11:12.767 --> 01:11:14.962
Have you tried the east building?

01:11:21.509 --> 01:11:23.443
- Has Julia left yet?
- I haven't seen her.

01:11:23.545 --> 01:11:25.775
- Mike, Mike. Have you seen Julia?
- Hey, you okay?

01:11:25.880 --> 01:11:27.404
- Have you seen Julia?
- No.

01:11:31.953 --> 01:11:33.784
Watch it, buddy!

01:11:44.466 --> 01:11:47.026
- Jules?
- You hung me outside of an airplane.

01:11:47.168 --> 01:11:48.965
You can always tell
someone's character

01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:51.595
by the way they treat those
they don't need to treat well.

01:11:51.706 --> 01:11:55.608
- If you hurt her, I swear...
- Don't threaten me. Just don't.

01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:59.544
The briefcase I picked up in Rome,
the one you took from me,

01:11:59.681 --> 01:12:01.774
contains the location
of the Rabbit's Foot.

01:12:01.883 --> 01:12:05.284
You're going to get it and bring it to me.
The Rabbit's Foot.

01:12:05.387 --> 01:12:08.288
Ethan, you had a watch
last time I saw you.

01:12:08.390 --> 01:12:11.154
You have 48 hours,
starting on my mark.

01:12:11.259 --> 01:12:12.487
Wait, wait, wait.

01:12:12.594 --> 01:12:14.653
Now, call me at this number
when you have it.

01:12:14.763 --> 01:12:17.493
- Just wait.
- Julia's life for the Rabbit's Foot.

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:21.000
- You have 48 hours, or she dies.
- Wait! Wait. Wait.

01:12:25.707 --> 01:12:28.005
Condition 1-116. All units on scene.

01:12:28.109 --> 01:12:30.043
We need you to come with us.

01:12:30.178 --> 01:12:32.510
Just... Pete, what the hell is this?

01:12:32.614 --> 01:12:35.310
Sorry about that, Mr. Hunt.
We were told to bring you in.

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:37.544
- Okay.
- Get ready to transport.

01:12:37.686 --> 01:12:39.449
Whoa. Hey. Just not right now.

01:12:39.554 --> 01:12:41.954
- Just tell them you came and that...
- Ethan. Get in.

01:12:42.057 --> 01:12:45.424
We don't want to use force here,
and you know we will. Ethan, get in.

01:12:45.527 --> 01:12:47.791
- Tell them that you came here...
- Ethan!

01:12:47.896 --> 01:12:49.989
...and that I left already, okay?

01:12:54.903 --> 01:12:56.097
Freeze!

01:12:56.404 --> 01:12:59.532
Ethan, stop! Stop, Ethan!

01:13:13.588 --> 01:13:15.385
Yeah. Get his hands.

01:13:43.251 --> 01:13:46.220
I reviewed the transcript
of your Berlin operation.

01:13:46.321 --> 01:13:48.221
It's very interesting.

01:13:48.323 --> 01:13:50.382
It seems that Agent Farris
had some information

01:13:50.492 --> 01:13:53.723
she wished to share with you
but not with this agency.

01:13:53.828 --> 01:13:55.591
Something you failed to report.

01:13:55.697 --> 01:13:58.894
You ordered the Vatican operation
without proper approvals.

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.434
That mission
resulted in a catastrophic attack.

01:14:01.536 --> 01:14:03.436
And then you fled the scene.

01:14:03.538 --> 01:14:06.632
Now, I am not a stranger to disrespect.

01:14:07.475 --> 01:14:10.342
You don't get to where I am
without developing a thick skin.

01:14:10.445 --> 01:14:12.606
But what I won't stand for,

01:14:12.981 --> 01:14:16.246
what I will lose sleep over,
and I love my sleep,

01:14:16.551 --> 01:14:20.282
is the idea of an irresponsible
rogue agent working in my office.

01:14:20.388 --> 01:14:24.154
So I'm going to
slow things way down here.

01:14:27.796 --> 01:14:29.263
You can look at me

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:32.527
with those judgmental,
incriminating eyes all you want,

01:14:32.667 --> 01:14:34.328
but I bullshit you not.

01:14:34.469 --> 01:14:38.269
I will bleed on the flag
to make sure the stripes stay red.

01:14:57.325 --> 01:14:59.623
I don't know what to say to you.

01:15:00.829 --> 01:15:03.559
Brassel's right. You're out of control.

01:15:04.899 --> 01:15:06.332
Look at me.

01:15:08.102 --> 01:15:12.402
Ethan, at least show me the courtesy
of looking at me when I'm talking to you.

01:15:21.049 --> 01:15:25.281
I intercepted Davian's call. I know he
wants the Rabbit's Foot for Julia's life.

01:15:25.386 --> 01:15:26.853
It's just...

01:15:29.257 --> 01:15:30.485
This is

01:15:31.292 --> 01:15:33.021
so disappointing.

01:15:33.661 --> 01:15:37.097
Go to Shanghai.
Feng Shan Apartments... 1406.

01:15:42.036 --> 01:15:45.733
I wish there was something I could do
to help you, but...

01:15:51.179 --> 01:15:53.010
Take him to the holding cell.

01:17:06.854 --> 01:17:08.287
No, I'm on it.

01:17:08.423 --> 01:17:10.554
Yes, sir. There's no need to panic.
I'll get him back.

01:17:10.654 --> 01:17:11.683
Sir? Ethan Hunt...

01:17:11.793 --> 01:17:13.277
I know what happened.
Give me the radio.

01:17:13.377 --> 01:17:16.143
This is Director Brassel. Ethan Hunt
is attempting to escape the building.

01:17:16.243 --> 01:17:18.205
He's in the west cargo elevator.
He must be stopped.

01:17:18.305 --> 01:17:21.030
I want Mendoza and Graham
in the situation room right away.

01:17:21.135 --> 01:17:22.864
I'm having the building surrounded, sir.

01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:24.681
I've got units posted
at all the entrances.

01:17:24.781 --> 01:17:28.037
This is Brassel again. I'm ordering
a code-six lockdown. I repeat.

01:17:28.142 --> 01:17:30.440
- It's Hunt.
- I know it's Hunt.

01:17:32.213 --> 01:17:34.943
Hunt was flagged
on sub-basement nine.

01:17:35.049 --> 01:17:38.348
I want all security personnel
down there now.

01:17:38.886 --> 01:17:40.547
Security channel's jammed.

01:17:40.655 --> 01:17:43.749
Hunt must be holding down
the transmit button.

01:18:07.315 --> 01:18:09.112
You've got to be kidding me.

01:18:19.827 --> 01:18:24.161
Last call for flight 1162 for Helsinki,
now boarding at gate 46.

01:18:27.201 --> 01:18:29.897
Final call for Mr. Bower.
Final call for Mr. Bower.

01:18:30.004 --> 01:18:31.562
Please come to gate 4.

01:18:32.440 --> 01:18:35.341
- Mr. Pavel Sobo... Sobotka.
- Sobotka.

01:18:35.443 --> 01:18:38.503
Sobotka. Okay.
And you're flying to Shanghai?

01:18:42.016 --> 01:18:45.679
I don't speak Czech. I'm sorry.
Let's see about your flight.

01:18:45.787 --> 01:18:46.981
Okay.

01:18:47.088 --> 01:18:48.919
- Okay.
- Okay.

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:28.845
Don't kill me.

01:20:30.391 --> 01:20:31.722
I'm sorry.

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:34.459
I'm sorry.

01:20:36.197 --> 01:20:39.724
Musgrave told us about Julia.
We're here to help.

01:20:39.867 --> 01:20:41.960
To get your wife,
you'll need the Rabbit's Foot.

01:20:42.069 --> 01:20:44.094
According to the plans
from Davian's briefcase,

01:20:44.205 --> 01:20:47.663
it's in a laboratory on the 56th floor
of the Hengshan Lu Building.

01:20:47.775 --> 01:20:49.689
Which is a nightmare
for just about every reason.

01:20:49.789 --> 01:20:53.373
They're a Chinese military contractor.
We have no pull, no details.

01:20:53.514 --> 01:20:55.311
The good news is, whatever it is,

01:20:55.416 --> 01:20:57.680
the Rabbit Foot's small,
so we can steal it.

01:20:57.785 --> 01:21:00.481
The bad news, we got to steal it.

01:21:01.355 --> 01:21:04.017
From a thief's point of view,
this is worst-case scenario.

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:06.320
The security guards
are all privately-contracted

01:21:06.427 --> 01:21:07.792
former People's Liberation Army.

01:21:07.895 --> 01:21:10.159
The only access to the lab
is by private elevator.

01:21:10.264 --> 01:21:12.926
And that can only be activated
by persons inside the lab.

01:21:13.034 --> 01:21:15.867
All of it surveilled by
security cameras within the building.

01:21:15.970 --> 01:21:17.835
What about the roof?

01:21:18.773 --> 01:21:21.537
Four guards full time.
Two on each rooftop.

01:21:21.642 --> 01:21:23.439
Langley was a cakewalk
compared to this.

01:21:23.544 --> 01:21:25.068
That's the one.

01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:27.948
- How tall is that building?
- Why?

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:30.347
It's 162 meters at the highest point.

01:21:30.451 --> 01:21:32.949
What about that, the building
on the left? How tall is that one?

01:21:33.049 --> 01:21:34.454
Says 226 meters.

01:21:34.589 --> 01:21:37.217
226. Distance between the buildings?

01:21:37.325 --> 01:21:39.122
47.55 meters across.

01:21:55.776 --> 01:21:56.936
Ethan?

01:21:57.678 --> 01:22:00.442
That's good. I think it's tall enough.

01:22:01.649 --> 01:22:04.083
- For what?
- A fulcrum.

01:22:06.187 --> 01:22:08.883
Oh, you're gonna swing...
No, no, no, no. Wait, wait.

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:11.390
- You could bounce right off the roof.
- Yes, I could.

01:22:11.492 --> 01:22:13.680
Even if you made it to the rooftop,
took out the guards,

01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:17.357
and got the Rabbit's Foot, you can't just
walk out of the lobby. What's your exit?

01:22:17.465 --> 01:22:19.092
Base-jump off the top. I need a chute.

01:22:19.200 --> 01:22:21.360
Even at 162, you're pushing
minimum height for a jump.

01:22:21.502 --> 01:22:23.246
Chute opens any lower than that
and you're dead.

01:22:23.346 --> 01:22:24.292
What are you going to do?

01:22:24.392 --> 01:22:26.489
Land in the middle of Shanghai
and hope no one notices?

01:22:26.589 --> 01:22:27.802
Central Park's two blocks away.

01:22:27.908 --> 01:22:29.959
Wait, wait, Ethan, I'm not saying
I have a better idea,

01:22:30.059 --> 01:22:32.378
but there's a point
where bold becomes stupid.

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.954
Now, we don't even know
what this thing is, and you're talking

01:22:35.054 --> 01:22:37.924
about handing it over to a guy
who provides terrorists with information.

01:22:38.024 --> 01:22:40.330
Luther, of course I'm not
suggesting that we just hand it over.

01:22:40.430 --> 01:22:43.196
We're going to tag the Rabbit's Foot
so we can trace it and know where it is.

01:22:43.296 --> 01:22:46.091
Now, you know we can get
that gear here. I just deliver it myself.

01:22:46.193 --> 01:22:49.060
We contact Musgrave,
have the IMF trace a tag, order a raid,

01:22:49.163 --> 01:22:50.926
get the Rabbit's Foot back, grab Davian.

01:22:51.032 --> 01:22:53.728
Now, if I get out with Julia, we win.

01:22:54.869 --> 01:22:56.632
If I don't, then...

01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:05.911
Look, then she's dead anyway.
And so am I.

01:23:07.114 --> 01:23:08.411
You know?

01:23:08.549 --> 01:23:12.883
Goddamn it, it's 8:11, it's 8:12.

01:23:15.389 --> 01:23:18.517
And we have two hours
before they kill my wife.

01:23:19.427 --> 01:23:21.156
Are you in or not?

01:23:28.736 --> 01:23:30.431
Of course we're in.

01:24:02.841 --> 01:24:04.604
You got 18 minutes.

01:24:07.012 --> 01:24:08.912
You're going to make it over there.

01:24:09.014 --> 01:24:12.347
You're going to find the Rabbit's Foot,
get back to the roof,

01:24:12.484 --> 01:24:14.244
radio me when you're ready to make
the jump,

01:24:14.386 --> 01:24:16.820
and we're going to come get you.

01:24:17.823 --> 01:24:19.552
Thank you for coming.

01:24:20.325 --> 01:24:21.792
That's my job.

01:24:58.096 --> 01:24:59.427
Batter up.

01:25:27.225 --> 01:25:30.251
Oh, yeah. They're freaking out.
Hit them again.

01:27:05.156 --> 01:27:06.282
Okay.

01:27:07.826 --> 01:27:08.826
He made it.

01:27:09.027 --> 01:27:10.392
He made it.

01:27:13.531 --> 01:27:15.294
I knew he'd make it.

01:27:29.848 --> 01:27:32.749
I'm going in. I'll be out in five minutes.

01:27:40.925 --> 01:27:43.325
- It's been 12 minutes.
- He's got five minutes left.

01:27:43.428 --> 01:27:46.864
If he doesn't call Davian in five minutes,
Julia's dead.

01:27:46.965 --> 01:27:48.330
Anything?

01:27:49.901 --> 01:27:50.901
Negative.

01:27:51.036 --> 01:27:53.163
How about you? Any good news?

01:27:53.271 --> 01:27:54.704
No, nothing.

01:27:54.873 --> 01:27:56.363
Come on, Ethan.

01:28:05.650 --> 01:28:07.117
What is that?

01:28:12.290 --> 01:28:16.590
When I was little I had a cat,
and he used to run away all the time.

01:28:18.096 --> 01:28:21.224
And it's just a prayer I'd say
to bring him home.

01:28:23.168 --> 01:28:24.692
Teach it to me.

01:28:26.471 --> 01:28:28.772
I've got the Rabbit's Foot,
but I can't make it to the roof.

01:28:28.872 --> 01:28:31.594
What the hell do you mean you can't
make it to the roof? Where are you?

01:28:31.694 --> 01:28:33.735
Look up! Look up, look up!

01:28:36.614 --> 01:28:38.775
- Oh, shit.
- He's way too low.

01:30:29.561 --> 01:30:32.553
- Ethan! Get in! They're coming!
- Who?

01:30:32.697 --> 01:30:35.325
Building security, and they're pissed.

01:30:37.936 --> 01:30:39.767
Okay. Go, go, go, go.

01:30:46.644 --> 01:30:48.737
How much time you got left?

01:30:49.047 --> 01:30:50.844
Less than two minutes.

01:30:57.155 --> 01:31:00.283
You gotta get us out of here.
I lost the signal.

01:31:02.994 --> 01:31:04.757
- You okay?
- Not yet.

01:31:13.137 --> 01:31:14.263
Come on. Come on.

01:31:21.679 --> 01:31:23.397
I don't have a signal.
I don't have a signal.

01:31:23.497 --> 01:31:24.694
I'm on it. I'm on it. I'm on it!

01:31:33.091 --> 01:31:34.149
Zhen!

01:31:36.294 --> 01:31:37.921
Damn it. I'm sorry.

01:31:46.170 --> 01:31:47.831
Put pressure on it.

01:31:48.339 --> 01:31:51.467
- Tell me when you get a signal.
- What are you doing?

01:32:10.561 --> 01:32:12.119
I got a signal!

01:32:16.467 --> 01:32:17.764
Hit redial.

01:32:19.904 --> 01:32:22.600
You only had five seconds left.
Do you realize that?

01:32:22.707 --> 01:32:25.005
The Rabbit's Foot. I have it.

01:32:25.376 --> 01:32:29.369
The train yard at Dunan Zhong Lu.
Wait for me there. Alone.

01:32:32.684 --> 01:32:34.151
- Yeah?
- Go secure.

01:32:34.252 --> 01:32:35.480
We are.

01:32:36.587 --> 01:32:38.612
I have the Rabbit's Foot.

01:32:38.723 --> 01:32:40.953
- You okay?
- I'm tagging it now.

01:32:43.928 --> 01:32:46.353
You need to run a trace.
Make sure we have eyes on this thing.

01:32:46.453 --> 01:32:49.366
- What's the tag?
- 6-3-9-6-4-1.

01:32:50.335 --> 01:32:51.495
Got it.

01:32:54.238 --> 01:32:55.569
I see you on Luang Tao Lu Road.

01:32:55.673 --> 01:32:59.165
If you don't hear from me in eight hours,
you send an army after this thing.

01:32:59.277 --> 01:33:01.142
- Good luck.
- You, too.

01:33:08.553 --> 01:33:10.350
- Mr. Musgrave.
- Yeah.

01:33:10.588 --> 01:33:12.647
It's come to my attention
that yesterday afternoon

01:33:12.757 --> 01:33:14.247
you sent a team to the Far East.

01:33:14.892 --> 01:33:16.951
We received intel that
Hadaam Saleen Bahar

01:33:17.061 --> 01:33:18.323
was en route to Shanghai.

01:33:18.429 --> 01:33:20.727
- Hadaam Saleen Bahar.
- That's right.

01:33:20.865 --> 01:33:22.853
You know what I'd love?
I'd love to see that intel.

01:33:22.953 --> 01:33:25.370
- I'll be in my office.
- Yes, sir.

01:33:37.882 --> 01:33:39.372
Thanks again.

01:33:39.784 --> 01:33:41.752
I'll see you back home.

01:33:42.653 --> 01:33:43.881
Ethan.

01:33:45.089 --> 01:33:48.058
You know they probably plan
to kill you both.

01:33:49.761 --> 01:33:52.059
Then I won't see you back home.

01:33:53.631 --> 01:33:55.189
Better get back.

01:34:42.180 --> 01:34:44.580
Drink it. No questions.

01:35:48.179 --> 01:35:49.544
Good morning.

01:36:05.463 --> 01:36:06.589
Jules.

01:36:07.798 --> 01:36:10.665
We've put an explosive charge
in your head.

01:36:10.768 --> 01:36:12.827
Does that sound familiar?

01:36:13.571 --> 01:36:15.869
The Rabbit's Foot. Where is it?

01:36:16.607 --> 01:36:18.268
I gave it to you.

01:36:18.876 --> 01:36:21.071
Now, I'm going to count to 10

01:36:21.212 --> 01:36:24.841
and you're going to tell me
where the Rabbit's Foot is

01:36:26.250 --> 01:36:27.615
or she dies.

01:36:52.810 --> 01:36:56.143
Seems we have a lot to talk about.
Don't we?

01:36:58.983 --> 01:37:00.917
- Do you think I'm playing?
- Son of a bitch!

01:37:01.018 --> 01:37:03.748
Do you think I'm playing?
You don't think I'll do it?

01:37:03.854 --> 01:37:04.912
Where is it?

01:37:05.022 --> 01:37:06.446
- Look at me.
- Where the hell is it?

01:37:06.546 --> 01:37:07.844
- Look at me. Stay with me.
- Seven!

01:37:07.944 --> 01:37:10.088
I am going to kill you.
I swear to God I'm going to...

01:37:10.194 --> 01:37:12.059
- Eight!
- No, please.

01:37:13.864 --> 01:37:17.391
Please. Don't do this. Just let her go.

01:37:18.002 --> 01:37:20.994
I promise you. I promise you.

01:37:21.372 --> 01:37:24.068
- I can figure out how to get whatever...
- Nine.

01:37:25.109 --> 01:37:28.044
Listen to me. I want to help you get
whatever you want.

01:37:28.145 --> 01:37:31.672
But you got to do what's right.
What you know is right.

01:37:32.617 --> 01:37:34.084
No, please...

01:37:36.721 --> 01:37:37.779
No.

01:37:40.024 --> 01:37:41.024
No.

01:37:41.392 --> 01:37:43.121
- Ten.
- Don't!

01:37:59.977 --> 01:38:03.606
I pushed him as far as he can go.
I know he's not lying.

01:38:03.914 --> 01:38:05.438
I understand.

01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:09.213
I've got some questions
I want to ask him first.

01:38:31.676 --> 01:38:33.303
It's complicated.

01:38:40.217 --> 01:38:42.412
You can't just open the canister.

01:38:42.553 --> 01:38:45.386
We had to make sure
you brought the real thing.

01:38:45.523 --> 01:38:48.822
The Rabbit's Foot. Now we know.

01:38:57.601 --> 01:39:00.832
Don't you touch her!
Don't you touch her!

01:39:10.081 --> 01:39:13.517
Davian's translator,
his Head of Security.

01:39:14.819 --> 01:39:17.947
Remember?
At the Vatican she failed him.

01:39:20.324 --> 01:39:24.522
Ethan, Julia is still alive.

01:39:25.329 --> 01:39:29.197
Davian wanted to kill you both,
but I convinced him otherwise.

01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:33.134
Julia hasn't seen me.
She doesn't know anything. She's clean.

01:39:33.304 --> 01:39:35.602
She can go on to have a life.

01:39:36.006 --> 01:39:40.568
As long as you tell me,
what was in Lindsey's message?

01:39:41.579 --> 01:39:44.412
I know she sent you a microdot
from Berlin.

01:39:45.816 --> 01:39:48.284
Did Lindsey know
about me and Davian?

01:39:48.419 --> 01:39:51.354
Is that why she sent the message
to you? Did you read it?

01:39:51.455 --> 01:39:53.082
Did anyone else see it?

01:39:53.190 --> 01:39:55.488
Did she know about the work
I was doing?

01:39:55.593 --> 01:39:57.561
Could I be compromised at IMF?

01:39:57.661 --> 01:39:59.288
Ethan. Ethan.

01:40:00.765 --> 01:40:03.097
Did she buy that Brassel set her up?

01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:04.929
Did she buy that?

01:40:06.203 --> 01:40:07.636
You told him.

01:40:09.006 --> 01:40:11.474
That's how Davian knew
Lindsey was coming.

01:40:11.609 --> 01:40:13.167
You told him.

01:40:15.146 --> 01:40:17.410
I thought you could get her back.

01:40:17.515 --> 01:40:21.110
But I wasn't gonna let Brassel,
of all people, undo the work I'd done.

01:40:21.218 --> 01:40:25.655
I took action, Ethan, on behalf
of the working families of our country.

01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:27.189
The Armed Forces, the White House.

01:40:27.291 --> 01:40:29.225
I'd had enough
of Brassel and his sanctimony.

01:40:29.326 --> 01:40:32.625
IMF Executive Director.
He's an affirmative action poster boy.

01:40:32.730 --> 01:40:36.188
You grab Davian like he wanted,
then what?

01:40:36.801 --> 01:40:38.428
Davian's a weed.

01:40:40.137 --> 01:40:44.164
You cut him out, two more spring up
just like him the next day.

01:40:44.375 --> 01:40:46.275
Arrest him? Then what?

01:40:47.711 --> 01:40:49.110
You use him.

01:40:50.581 --> 01:40:53.209
Collaborate with him.

01:40:54.718 --> 01:40:56.709
And it's Christmas.

01:40:58.556 --> 01:41:01.491
In 18 hours,
the Rabbit's Foot will be delivered

01:41:01.592 --> 01:41:04.891
to its Middle Eastern buyer,
and we'll have credible intel to prove it.

01:41:04.995 --> 01:41:07.828
US Security Council will get a report
by this time tomorrow.

01:41:07.932 --> 01:41:10.992
We're talking a military strike
within a week.

01:41:11.402 --> 01:41:13.461
And when the sand settles,

01:41:13.938 --> 01:41:16.406
our country will do what it does best.

01:41:16.540 --> 01:41:19.202
Clean up. Infrastructure.

01:41:20.945 --> 01:41:22.537
Democracy wins.

01:41:26.917 --> 01:41:29.750
What was Lindsey's message?

01:41:30.788 --> 01:41:34.087
You tell me, and Julia walks.

01:41:36.694 --> 01:41:39.162
It's the only play you have left.

01:41:40.531 --> 01:41:43.898
Not till I hear her voice,
know she's alive.

01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:47.367
Of course.

01:42:00.484 --> 01:42:01.849
Put her on.

01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:11.045
- Jules?
- Ethan?

01:42:11.145 --> 01:42:12.046
- Jules?
- Ethan?

01:42:12.146 --> 01:42:15.127
When we met,
there was a lake near the mountain.

01:42:17.334 --> 01:42:19.302
What was the lake called?

01:42:20.638 --> 01:42:21.866
Wanaka.

01:42:22.473 --> 01:42:24.031
Please, Ethan.

01:42:24.241 --> 01:42:26.766
- Jules.
- Ethan, I don't understand...

01:42:46.163 --> 01:42:47.653
Benjamin Dunne.

01:42:48.432 --> 01:42:49.490
Benji, it's me.

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:52.626
- Ethan.
- What? No. Really?

01:42:52.770 --> 01:42:54.610
Listen to me very carefully.
I need your help.

01:42:56.140 --> 01:42:59.371
I need to trace the location
of the last call made from this phone.

01:42:59.476 --> 01:43:01.103
Look, no. Ethan. Shush.

01:43:01.211 --> 01:43:02.999
They're looking...
Everyone's looking for you.

01:43:03.099 --> 01:43:06.107
Everyone I know. They're looking...
I just looked it up.

01:43:06.216 --> 01:43:08.047
Okay, you're on
Interpol's most wanted list.

01:43:08.152 --> 01:43:10.620
And that, by the way,
is a spectacular list to be on.

01:43:10.721 --> 01:43:13.215
Whatever happened, I'm sorry,
but I'm hanging up now right now.

01:43:13.315 --> 01:43:14.588
Benji, I don't have time for this.

01:43:14.688 --> 01:43:16.343
What do you think happened?
I've been set up.

01:43:16.443 --> 01:43:19.420
I think I like my job. Okay? A lot.

01:43:19.530 --> 01:43:21.725
All right? And you know
they're gonna be taping this call.

01:43:21.825 --> 01:43:24.429
And you know you can erase it.
I'm giving you the number right now.

01:43:24.535 --> 01:43:26.628
- Are you ready?
- All right. Just hang on.

01:43:26.737 --> 01:43:29.103
I'm gonna lose my citizenship
because of this, you know.

01:43:29.206 --> 01:43:32.039
7-3-4-4-2-5-6-4-3-6-7.

01:43:32.176 --> 01:43:34.940
Okay. Wait. Okay. Hold the line, please.

01:43:49.259 --> 01:43:50.851
- Are you there?
- Yeah.

01:43:50.995 --> 01:43:52.189
Okay.

01:43:52.896 --> 01:43:56.024
Maybe we can share a jail cell together,
you know?

01:43:56.166 --> 01:43:58.691
If this all goes tits up, which it will.

01:43:58.836 --> 01:44:00.633
The location of that number
is Shanghai.

01:44:00.738 --> 01:44:02.032
There, I just told you. Shanghai.

01:44:02.132 --> 01:44:04.864
I've just aided and abetted an enemy
of the state. Fantastic. Thank you.

01:44:04.964 --> 01:44:07.140
Am I close?
Use this phone to track my location.

01:44:07.244 --> 01:44:09.644
Oh, you're there. Well, you're close.

01:44:09.747 --> 01:44:11.510
How close?
Is the signal in the building?

01:44:11.615 --> 01:44:13.129
No, no, no. It isn't coming from there.

01:44:13.229 --> 01:44:14.983
It's in a building
one mile to the northeast.

01:44:15.085 --> 01:44:16.677
Benji, lead me to the signal.

01:44:29.233 --> 01:44:32.725
There is one thing. What the hell
are you doing in Shanghai?

01:44:32.870 --> 01:44:35.031
I'll tell you when I see you.

01:44:43.580 --> 01:44:45.844
What you...
You need to go north.

01:44:45.949 --> 01:44:48.315
Okay, there's a bridge.
Get to it, cross it.

01:44:48.419 --> 01:44:51.752
Make a left. Go three-quarters of a mile
along the river.

01:44:51.889 --> 01:44:53.686
I got it. I got it.

01:45:29.093 --> 01:45:31.040
Good, good. That's right.
Keep going. Keep going.

01:45:31.140 --> 01:45:32.669
Make your next left
and then the next one.

01:45:32.769 --> 01:45:34.221
And then follow that down 1,000 yards.

01:45:34.331 --> 01:45:35.992
A thousand yards.

01:45:36.366 --> 01:45:39.267
- Okay. Okay, okay.
- Okay, okay. Left. Left.

01:45:39.837 --> 01:45:41.988
Yeah, that's good. That's good.
Keep going. Keep going.

01:45:42.088 --> 01:45:44.166
Okay, now look... Hiya. Hi.

01:45:44.308 --> 01:45:45.775
Benji, where?

01:45:45.876 --> 01:45:48.140
- Benji? Which way do I go?
- Now take a right.

01:45:54.885 --> 01:45:56.352
Okay. Go down, left.

01:45:56.787 --> 01:45:58.618
Left? I'm going left.

01:46:00.524 --> 01:46:01.616
Good, good.

01:46:01.725 --> 01:46:03.454
It's in the second building on your left.

01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:05.926
The signal bearing's
plus or minus three meters

01:46:06.029 --> 01:46:07.155
from the northeast corner.

01:46:07.698 --> 01:46:08.960
I owe you.

01:48:06.250 --> 01:48:08.150
Jules. Jules.

01:48:08.819 --> 01:48:10.446
You're gonna be okay.

01:48:13.490 --> 01:48:14.752
Oh, God!

01:48:15.292 --> 01:48:16.316
God!

01:48:27.004 --> 01:48:29.438
I've activated the charge in your head.

01:48:34.945 --> 01:48:37.413
You have maybe four minutes left.

01:48:46.890 --> 01:48:49.586
Didn't I tell you
she'd call out your name?

01:48:55.699 --> 01:48:58.668
Ethan. Ethan.

01:49:02.806 --> 01:49:03.864
No.

01:49:08.745 --> 01:49:10.042
Please.

01:49:14.885 --> 01:49:18.218
And I told you I was going to kill you
in front of her?

01:49:18.355 --> 01:49:20.880
Well, I'm going to kill her in front of you.

01:51:13.437 --> 01:51:14.563
Ethan?

01:51:17.874 --> 01:51:19.341
Are you okay?

01:51:20.444 --> 01:51:22.173
I don't understand
what's going on, Ethan.

01:51:22.279 --> 01:51:25.214
- I know. I know. Just wait.
- What do those men want from you?

01:51:25.315 --> 01:51:27.943
Why are we here?
How did you find me?

01:51:29.052 --> 01:51:31.850
Please, Ethan.
What the hell is going on?

01:51:32.022 --> 01:51:33.319
Are you okay?

01:51:33.457 --> 01:51:37.154
Ethan, what's wrong? Okay. Oh, God.

01:51:40.297 --> 01:51:44.165
I'm going to tell you everything.
You just stay with me.

01:51:50.807 --> 01:51:53.708
Ethan. What's happening?
What are you looking for?

01:51:53.844 --> 01:51:56.540
- We've got to get out of here.
- Not yet.

01:51:58.348 --> 01:52:00.043
- They don't have one!
- What?

01:52:00.150 --> 01:52:02.550
- A defibrillator.
- A defibrillator?

01:52:02.686 --> 01:52:03.778
Ethan?

01:52:04.554 --> 01:52:08.490
Ethan? Who are these people?
What the hell are we doing here?

01:52:11.394 --> 01:52:12.622
Good!

01:52:14.064 --> 01:52:16.157
This is a Beretta 92F.

01:52:17.000 --> 01:52:18.797
It's a very accurate,
close-range weapon.

01:52:18.902 --> 01:52:21.132
- Don't point it at me.
- Sorry.

01:52:23.106 --> 01:52:24.505
It holds 15 rounds.

01:52:24.608 --> 01:52:27.975
When the mag is empty,
the slide will lock back like this.

01:52:28.078 --> 01:52:30.308
How do you know so much about this?

01:52:30.413 --> 01:52:33.007
To reload, push this button.

01:52:33.450 --> 01:52:35.008
The empty mag falls out

01:52:35.118 --> 01:52:37.052
and you shove the other one in,

01:52:37.187 --> 01:52:39.655
like the batteries in the flashlight
in the kitchen,

01:52:39.756 --> 01:52:41.690
then release the slide.

01:52:44.895 --> 01:52:47.013
- Why are you giving me a gun?
- There could be others.

01:52:47.113 --> 01:52:48.793
If you have to use it, you stay low.

01:52:48.899 --> 01:52:51.595
You identify your enemy.
Point and shoot.

01:52:51.735 --> 01:52:53.293
It's very simple. Point and shoot.

01:52:53.403 --> 01:52:54.768
Stand back.

01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:57.598
Good.

01:52:58.942 --> 01:53:01.672
I have a charge in my head.
I'm going to die unless you kill me.

01:53:01.778 --> 01:53:03.769
- What?
- Throw the switch on and off.

01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:05.438
- Don't forget the off.
- I can't do that.

01:53:05.538 --> 01:53:07.645
You can bring me back.
I'll come back.

01:53:07.751 --> 01:53:09.981
- I can't.
- You have to! There's no time!

01:53:10.086 --> 01:53:11.553
Now! Please!

01:53:18.428 --> 01:53:20.953
Wait, wait! Wait. Wait. I love you.

01:53:21.264 --> 01:53:22.595
I love you.

01:54:37.741 --> 01:54:38.969
Oh, God.

01:54:45.148 --> 01:54:46.615
Come on, baby.

01:54:50.987 --> 01:54:54.388
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight,

01:54:54.524 --> 01:54:58.119
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen,
fourteen, fifteen.

01:55:03.233 --> 01:55:07.727
Come on, baby.
I need you to come back.

01:55:09.172 --> 01:55:10.730
I need you back.

01:55:56.986 --> 01:55:58.283
Oh, God.

01:56:07.564 --> 01:56:08.963
You did that?

01:56:12.836 --> 01:56:13.928
Wow.

01:56:40.830 --> 01:56:42.923
So, I was just thinking...

01:56:45.368 --> 01:56:49.304
I was thinking you might want to tell me
why we're in China.

01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:52.068
I know.

01:56:56.179 --> 01:56:57.237
I...

01:56:59.048 --> 01:57:00.913
I work for an agency.

01:57:01.985 --> 01:57:03.577
It's called IMF.

01:57:06.322 --> 01:57:08.290
What does that stand for?

01:57:09.526 --> 01:57:11.585
Impossible Mission Force.

01:57:12.562 --> 01:57:13.756
Shut up.

01:57:14.664 --> 01:57:16.029
No, I'm not kidding.

01:57:16.132 --> 01:57:20.000
You don't understand.
Everything I'm telling you is top-secret.

01:57:20.136 --> 01:57:21.831
You can trust me.

01:57:22.338 --> 01:57:23.600
Yeah, I know.

01:57:25.008 --> 01:57:27.568
Just wanna show my appreciation
for your work.

01:57:35.051 --> 01:57:38.953
Call it reparations for anything
I might have put you through.

01:57:39.355 --> 01:57:41.448
You should know
the White House has contacted me.

01:57:41.558 --> 01:57:43.890
Now, there's a job that they are

01:57:44.561 --> 01:57:47.155
very interested
in speaking with you about.

01:57:50.600 --> 01:57:53.034
Thank you,

01:57:54.103 --> 01:57:55.327
but I have a lot to think about.

01:57:55.427 --> 01:57:58.397
You aren't considering quitting,
are you, Ethan?

01:57:58.541 --> 01:58:01.135
I'm considering
going on my honeymoon.

01:58:04.113 --> 01:58:05.273
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

01:58:05.381 --> 01:58:06.473
Yeah.

01:58:08.284 --> 01:58:09.842
Hey, one thing.

01:58:11.421 --> 01:58:13.685
The Rabbit's Foot. What is it?

01:58:17.126 --> 01:58:19.924
Promise me you'll stay, I'll tell you.

01:58:22.565 --> 01:58:25.363
- I'll send you a postcard.
- Fair enough.
