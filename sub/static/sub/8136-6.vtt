00:27.600 --> 00:30.296
There's insufficient distance
for turbo boost, Michael.

00:30.369 --> 00:32.098
Pray for no bumps
and hold on.

00:32.171 --> 00:34.196
They tried to kill
your brother at the hospital.

00:34.307 --> 00:35.296
Oh, no.

00:41.147 --> 00:43.581
I don't believe it.
There's a car on the water!

00:43.649 --> 00:45.844
Michael, what are you
doing here?

00:46.185 --> 00:48.551
It was either stop him
or risk losing everything.

00:48.621 --> 00:51.419
Look at this regulator hose.
Tell me that crimp is an accident.

00:51.490 --> 00:52.514
What do you want from me?

00:52.592 --> 00:53.581
How about the truth?

00:56.662 --> 01:00.029
I keep getting the feeling that you
think Bobby was doing something wrong.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.199
No littering.

01:10.243 --> 01:12.677
I'm pulling his water wings.
He's lucky he didn't sink.

01:14.580 --> 01:15.911
Prepare to get wet, pal.

01:15.982 --> 01:17.813
This is no time
for Long John Silver!

01:17.884 --> 01:19.351
Fire!

01:19.418 --> 01:20.885
Depth charges!

01:35.835 --> 01:38.269
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight

01:38.337 --> 01:40.669
into the dangerous world
of a man,

01:40.773 --> 01:42.741
who does not exist.

01:53.085 --> 01:55.178
Michael Knight, a young loner,

01:55.254 --> 01:57.688
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:57.757 --> 01:59.884
the helpless, the powerless,

01:59.959 --> 02:03.360
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

03:59.845 --> 04:01.745
I detect the odor of fish.

04:01.814 --> 04:03.213
Good. That tells me

04:03.315 --> 04:06.341
your program is programmed
and your senses are sensing.

04:09.355 --> 04:11.255
Michael, April's calling.

04:12.625 --> 04:14.490
Are you ready
for the test, Michael?

04:14.560 --> 04:16.027
Oh, hi, April.

04:16.095 --> 04:17.858
I'm ready if KITT's ready.

04:17.930 --> 04:20.057
KITT?
I'm glad you asked, April.

04:20.132 --> 04:22.123
In light of
the extensive micronetics

04:22.201 --> 04:23.862
involved in
the system interface,

04:23.969 --> 04:25.994
not to mention-
He's ready.

04:26.105 --> 04:27.072
Good.

04:27.173 --> 04:29.471
Michael, I prefer
speaking for myself.

04:29.575 --> 04:32.203
In truth, there's
a primary aversion involved.

04:32.311 --> 04:34.404
I know, buddy,
you hate the smell of fish.

04:34.513 --> 04:36.674
I dislike the smell of fish.

04:36.849 --> 04:38.373
I hate salt water.

04:38.651 --> 04:40.175
Think of it this way.

04:40.252 --> 04:42.777
April wants to see
if you can swim,

04:42.855 --> 04:44.948
and I'm along for the ride.

04:45.958 --> 04:47.118
Here we go.

04:47.193 --> 04:48.990
Hang on to your fenders, pal.

04:55.801 --> 04:57.291
Abort the test!

04:57.369 --> 05:01.100
Abort! My sensors detect a life
form in distress at 3 o'clock.

05:13.853 --> 05:14.945
KITT!

05:15.287 --> 05:17.312
Give me a run down
with vitals.

05:17.389 --> 05:20.654
The object's body chemistry is
not within human limits, Michael.

05:20.726 --> 05:22.717
I measure a saturation
of nitrogen gas

05:22.795 --> 05:24.626
in the body tissues
and fluids.

05:24.697 --> 05:27.131
3.78 liters to be exact.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.295
You don't suppose
it's an alien?

05:29.368 --> 05:33.236
No. He's a scuba diver,
KITT, not E.T.

05:33.739 --> 05:36.139
Nitrogen saturation means
he's got the bends.

05:36.208 --> 05:39.439
Give me a scan on the nearest
hospital with a recompression chamber.

05:39.512 --> 05:41.275
Right away, Michael.

05:43.883 --> 05:46.909
I've got the place, Michael.
It's Cates Memorial Hospital.

05:47.453 --> 05:48.818
Right, pal.

05:51.123 --> 05:52.181
Pop the trunk, KITT.

05:52.258 --> 05:53.623
There you are, Michael.

06:23.122 --> 06:24.646
How is he, KITT?
Any better?

06:24.723 --> 06:26.782
His condition is
deteriorating, Michael.

06:32.431 --> 06:34.422
Michael, there's
an obstruction ahead.

06:34.800 --> 06:35.789
Uh-oh.

06:38.404 --> 06:39.871
Hang on, pal.

06:46.712 --> 06:49.010
Good work, buddy.

07:01.994 --> 07:05.987
Dr. Adler wanted in surgery.
Dr. Adler wanted in surgery.

07:10.836 --> 07:14.067
You have no idea if there
was any stage-decompression?

07:14.173 --> 07:15.231
You know everything I do.

07:15.341 --> 07:17.002
I just found him
on the beach.

07:17.109 --> 07:19.634
I knew something like this
would happen someday.

07:19.745 --> 07:20.769
You know him?

07:20.879 --> 07:24.076
Bobby Shell. I went to
high school with his sister.

07:38.030 --> 07:39.554
Thanks, Harold.

07:54.980 --> 07:56.208
Oh, God!

07:57.216 --> 07:58.376
Tracy!

07:59.385 --> 08:01.285
Hi, Jenny.
Take it easy.

08:01.353 --> 08:03.378
I think
he's gonna be okay.

08:03.756 --> 08:05.781
We've got him down
to four atmospheres.

08:06.692 --> 08:10.287
It's gonna take us a while before we
get back up to the surface, though.

08:10.362 --> 08:11.727
Excuse me.

08:12.931 --> 08:15.695
My name is Michael Knight.
I brought Bobby in.

08:15.768 --> 08:17.668
Is he
a certified diver?

08:18.304 --> 08:20.534
He taught Scuba
at the Y for two years.

08:20.606 --> 08:21.664
Why?

08:22.374 --> 08:25.241
Well, it seems to me he
ignored the first commandment.

08:25.311 --> 08:26.903
Never dive alone.

08:29.481 --> 08:30.607
Look,

08:31.417 --> 08:34.352
thank you very much
for what you did, really.

08:34.986 --> 08:36.852
For all I know
you saved his life.

08:37.956 --> 08:40.754
Let's just leave it
at that for now, okay?

08:42.061 --> 08:43.426
All right.

08:58.177 --> 08:59.576
No littering.

09:09.288 --> 09:10.619
Thank you.

09:15.394 --> 09:17.794
Michael, Bobby's diving gear
is still in the trunk.

09:17.863 --> 09:20.388
You have no idea
how unpleasant that odor is.

09:20.466 --> 09:22.093
Oh, well, allow me.

09:25.504 --> 09:27.131
Okay, let's see.

09:30.075 --> 09:31.940
You dropped something.

09:39.585 --> 09:41.712
I guess Bobby
collected shells, huh?

09:41.787 --> 09:45.086
Judging from its surface
density, it is not a shell.

09:45.157 --> 09:46.920
Okay, smart guy, what is it?

09:46.992 --> 09:49.859
I believe you're familiar
with the procedure, Michael.

09:51.363 --> 09:53.228
I'm tellin' you, KITT,

09:53.799 --> 09:55.426
this is a shell.

10:03.542 --> 10:05.703
Clever. Very, very clever.

10:05.811 --> 10:06.778
I thought so.

10:06.845 --> 10:09.814
Spectrographic analysis
determines it to be an element.

10:09.915 --> 10:11.507
Atomic number 79.

10:11.583 --> 10:14.575
Atomic weight 126.967.

10:14.653 --> 10:16.450
English, por favor.

10:16.522 --> 10:18.422
It is an element
known as gold.

10:18.490 --> 10:19.479
Gold.

10:19.558 --> 10:23.722
You may examine the object in a
more presentable state now, Michael.

10:27.766 --> 10:29.324
Check this out.

10:30.769 --> 10:32.168
Any idea how old it is?

10:32.237 --> 10:34.705
My data banks have
nothing on it, Michael.

10:34.807 --> 10:36.775
It's obviously quite old.

10:37.609 --> 10:38.633
Is it valuable?

10:38.744 --> 10:40.041
Possibly.

10:40.145 --> 10:41.203
Why?

10:42.481 --> 10:46.542
It might help explain why a scuba
instructor went divin' all by himself.

10:46.618 --> 10:49.018
I'm not sure I understand
your logic, Michael.

10:50.322 --> 10:52.085
Neither am I, KITT.

10:53.091 --> 10:54.649
Neither am I.

10:56.328 --> 10:57.727
Need a lift?

11:01.300 --> 11:03.393
Well, you've got
amazing timing.

11:03.469 --> 11:04.595
Okay.

11:20.919 --> 11:23.387
Jennifer, I found this
in Bobby's gear.

11:23.455 --> 11:25.480
Any idea where he got it?

11:25.958 --> 11:26.982
No.

11:27.326 --> 11:28.725
Is it gold?

11:28.894 --> 11:31.590
Yeah, it's gold.
And it's very old.

11:32.397 --> 11:34.991
If it's all right with you,
I'd like to check it out.

11:35.400 --> 11:36.458
Why?

11:36.835 --> 11:39.861
I wanna find out if it ties
in with Bobby's, um,

11:40.572 --> 11:41.834
accident.

11:42.808 --> 11:46.244
I keep getting the feeling that you
think Bobby was doing something wrong.

11:46.311 --> 11:47.642
No, I didn't say that.

11:47.713 --> 11:50.944
Why is everyone so eager
to think the worst of him?

11:51.016 --> 11:52.677
He goes
to South Coast Junior College,

11:52.751 --> 11:56.016
he dives for the lobster and
fish we serve in the restaurant,

11:56.088 --> 11:59.023
and he has never been
in any serious trouble.

11:59.424 --> 12:01.824
Jennifer, take a look
at this regulator hose.

12:01.894 --> 12:03.521
It's crimped
on both sides.

12:03.629 --> 12:06.325
Now, no piece of rock
does that.

12:07.199 --> 12:10.760
I can't prove it yet, but I think
it was done by another diver.

12:15.140 --> 12:17.108
It's right here.
The Three Shells.

12:17.209 --> 12:18.836
You can park right there.

12:26.184 --> 12:27.173
Hi.

12:28.020 --> 12:29.112
What's going on?

12:29.187 --> 12:32.122
It must've broke loose
from Bobby's dive site.

12:32.190 --> 12:33.782
I'll tie her up for you.

12:33.859 --> 12:35.156
Thanks a lot.

12:35.260 --> 12:37.160
Everybody's concerned.

12:38.096 --> 12:39.563
How's Bobby doin'?

12:41.066 --> 12:42.863
It's too soon
to tell yet.

12:43.001 --> 12:45.834
He's still in the recompression
chamber at Cates Memorial.

12:47.372 --> 12:50.466
Yeah. Let me know if
there's anything I can do.

12:52.177 --> 12:53.667
Thanks, Manley.

13:02.287 --> 13:03.584
Look, I-

13:04.423 --> 13:05.720
I'm sorry.

13:05.791 --> 13:08.316
I guess I haven't really been
very grateful, have I?

13:09.394 --> 13:11.362
It's all right.
It's not required.

13:12.230 --> 13:13.697
You like lobster?

13:13.765 --> 13:16.666
I happen to have a real beauty
left from Bobby's last dive.

13:18.203 --> 13:19.761
Is that an invitation?

13:20.305 --> 13:21.966
How about tonight?

13:38.457 --> 13:39.446
Hey.

13:42.928 --> 13:44.327
Stow all that stuff there.

13:44.396 --> 13:45.454
Okay.

13:49.635 --> 13:50.863
Let's go.

13:53.472 --> 13:54.803
Watch it now.

13:56.875 --> 13:57.842
You get everything?

13:57.943 --> 13:59.433
It's all set.

13:59.544 --> 14:01.011
Where's Karl?

14:01.179 --> 14:02.373
Oh, he's

14:03.048 --> 14:05.642
checking the developments
at the hospital.

14:05.717 --> 14:08.049
Listen, when I signed on
for this charter,

14:08.120 --> 14:10.452
there wasn't any talk
about murder, you know.

14:10.522 --> 14:12.649
What choice did
we have, Manley?

14:12.724 --> 14:15.887
It was either stop him
or risk losing everything.

14:16.094 --> 14:17.152
Relax.

14:17.229 --> 14:19.891
There's a good chance that kid
won't regain consciousness

14:19.965 --> 14:22.263
before we correct
the Marquesa's drift,

14:22.401 --> 14:24.869
gain access to that chamber
and get out of here.

14:25.604 --> 14:27.469
Michael, is this
your way of saying

14:27.539 --> 14:29.507
you aborted KITT's
amphibious test?

14:29.574 --> 14:31.542
Yes. No, I mean...

14:31.877 --> 14:33.003
Just a minute.

14:33.111 --> 14:36.342
Devon, I'm tellin' you this
guy is an experienced diver.

14:36.415 --> 14:39.407
He goes divin' all by himself
and he gets the bends.

14:40.419 --> 14:42.683
Devon, take a look
at this regulator hose.

14:42.754 --> 14:44.915
Tell me that crimp
is an accident.

14:44.990 --> 14:47.584
Michael, would you
please remove this?

14:47.959 --> 14:50.325
This is a desk,
not a workbench.

14:50.462 --> 14:53.454
I'm tellin' you, I think somebody
tried to murder Bobby Shell.

14:53.532 --> 14:55.659
If you're right, Michael,
it's a job for the police.

14:55.734 --> 14:56.860
Devon.
Michael, I-

14:56.935 --> 14:59.369
Please. Please stop
this lobbying.

14:59.938 --> 15:02.873
Michael, you apparently saved
the boy's life. That's wonderful.

15:02.974 --> 15:04.236
Now please let him live it.

15:04.309 --> 15:05.640
All right.

15:05.777 --> 15:07.267
You're the boss.

15:07.379 --> 15:10.143
I guess I'll just have to take
this back to Bobby Shell's sister,

15:10.215 --> 15:12.410
without ever finding out
where it came from.

15:13.251 --> 15:14.741
Just a minute.
Oh.

15:15.587 --> 15:16.952
Where'd you find this?

15:17.022 --> 15:18.853
In Bobby Shell's
diving gear.

15:20.926 --> 15:23.793
Uh, do you always have
an ace up your sleeve?

15:23.862 --> 15:25.329
This is incredible.

15:25.397 --> 15:26.989
I'd have to authenticate,
of course,

15:27.065 --> 15:29.556
but, uh, I believe that
this coin is Aztec.

15:29.634 --> 15:32.000
Yeah, well, it's too bad
we can't investigate, huh,

15:32.070 --> 15:33.901
but I guess KITT's
test comes first.

15:34.005 --> 15:36.098
Just a minute, Michael,
don't be in such a rush.

15:36.208 --> 15:37.607
This may be important.

15:37.676 --> 15:39.371
April,
contact Research.

15:39.478 --> 15:42.470
Tell them I want everything
they've got on Aztec coins.

15:42.581 --> 15:45.049
Wait a minute. Does this mean
it's a Foundation project?

15:45.150 --> 15:47.277
Devon, you're not thinking
of postponing the test?

15:47.352 --> 15:49.252
I mean, not after all
our preparation.

15:49.321 --> 15:51.983
I'll get cracking on the research
and authentication immediately.

15:52.057 --> 15:53.957
Sorry. Don't be such
a sore loser.

16:04.736 --> 16:05.725
Jennifer-

16:05.804 --> 16:07.669
No, thanks. It's okay.

16:09.975 --> 16:12.876
You know, that coin has been
authenticated as an Aztec.

16:12.944 --> 16:16.277
Now exactly where Bobby found
it or how he got a hold of it

16:16.348 --> 16:17.815
I don't know.

16:18.483 --> 16:19.711
Do you?

16:19.785 --> 16:20.843
No.

16:23.722 --> 16:26.748
This thing is just as
confusing to me as it is to you.

16:27.192 --> 16:28.853
Please believe me.

16:29.728 --> 16:32.526
Bobby's behavior patterns
been different lately?

16:32.597 --> 16:34.690
The people
he hangs around with?

16:34.766 --> 16:36.700
No, not that I've noticed.

16:37.202 --> 16:38.601
What about the bay?

16:38.670 --> 16:40.661
Anything different
goin' on out there?

16:40.739 --> 16:41.797
No.

16:44.209 --> 16:45.904
There is the Fin Quest.

16:46.011 --> 16:47.638
She's anchored
right out there.

16:47.746 --> 16:50.010
She's here
on a Project Sea Life grant.

16:50.081 --> 16:52.675
They're reseeding
the reef for abalone.

16:53.084 --> 16:55.109
The guy who, uh,
tied up the inflatable.

16:55.187 --> 16:57.155
He's been hired as
one of their divers.

16:58.290 --> 16:59.917
Michael, please.

17:00.725 --> 17:02.784
Could we just close
this subject for a while?

17:02.861 --> 17:04.556
At least until
we finish dinner.

17:04.596 --> 17:05.688
Yeah, sure.

17:05.730 --> 17:07.560
Hey, you know what?
You were right.

17:08.300 --> 17:09.767
The lobster's incredible.

17:09.835 --> 17:11.826
I think you have
spoiled me for life.

17:13.704 --> 17:14.933
Well, what else?

17:15.040 --> 17:17.031
You have now dined
at The Three Shells.

17:18.777 --> 17:20.574
Wait a minute. I count, uh,

17:20.645 --> 17:22.875
Bobby Shell
and Jennifer Shell.

17:23.248 --> 17:24.839
Who's the third?

17:25.483 --> 17:26.676
My dad.

17:28.553 --> 17:29.781
He, uh,

17:30.622 --> 17:32.613
he died three years ago.

17:34.025 --> 17:35.652
It was his dream,

17:35.894 --> 17:38.795
the three of us running
this place together

17:39.497 --> 17:42.227
and building it up
into something special.

17:44.903 --> 17:46.996
Hey, Bobby's gonna be okay.

17:47.672 --> 17:48.832
Right.

17:49.074 --> 17:51.167
But, Jennifer,
if I'm right,

17:52.544 --> 17:55.570
whatever he stumbled into
is not gonna go away.

17:57.082 --> 17:58.982
I want to check it out.

18:00.619 --> 18:03.213
I'd like to think
we're on the same side.

18:09.060 --> 18:10.152
We are.

18:10.228 --> 18:11.320
Okay.

18:12.397 --> 18:16.026
This is Marine Operator 65
calling the Fin Quest.

18:16.334 --> 18:19.394
Whiskey Alpha 2-0-4-1.

18:19.938 --> 18:23.135
This is Fin Quest.
Whiskey Alpha 2-0-4-1. Over.

18:23.241 --> 18:26.233
Manley, this is Karl.
He's still in recompression,

18:26.945 --> 18:29.106
but he's recovering. Over.

18:31.049 --> 18:33.142
Now what do you wanna do?

18:33.985 --> 18:36.249
You put all of this
on a scale

18:36.388 --> 18:38.288
at current bullion prices.

18:38.356 --> 18:41.917
There is 1.6 million of this
in the hold right now.

18:42.694 --> 18:44.286
You want to lose it all?

18:45.363 --> 18:46.796
You tell me.

19:47.625 --> 19:50.219
I just got an update from
Research and Development.

19:50.295 --> 19:52.058
It seems they now
have some questions

19:52.130 --> 19:55.531
about the viability of the
Third Stage Aquatic Synthesizer.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.158
What kind of questions,
April?

19:57.235 --> 19:58.827
The sinking kind.

19:59.170 --> 20:00.467
Yes, sinking.

20:00.538 --> 20:03.473
As in Michael Knight's
popularity around here.

20:04.442 --> 20:07.104
April, I hope this means the
tests have been cancelled.

20:07.212 --> 20:09.180
Temporarily postponed.

20:09.414 --> 20:10.472
Good.

20:10.582 --> 20:13.483
Well, don't worry. I'll make
sure that the system is foolproof

20:13.551 --> 20:15.644
before we commit
to another test.

20:15.754 --> 20:17.585
Well, you do trust me,
don't you, KITT?

20:17.655 --> 20:18.644
Of course, April.

20:18.723 --> 20:21.851
But cars simply aren't meant
to travel in water.

20:21.926 --> 20:24.394
You won't be in the water.
You'll be on it.

20:24.462 --> 20:26.123
It's called hydroplaning.

20:27.999 --> 20:30.024
The coin is only
the beginning, Michael.

20:31.736 --> 20:34.637
Devon, did you find something to
connect them with Bobby's attack?

20:34.706 --> 20:36.298
No, to the coin.

20:37.342 --> 20:38.400
Now, look here.

20:41.613 --> 20:43.513
That figure is Nacinda.

20:43.948 --> 20:47.111
An exquisite Aztec
statue stolen by Cortes.

20:48.486 --> 20:50.215
What's that got
to do with Bobby?

20:50.455 --> 20:51.888
Perhaps a great deal.

20:53.792 --> 20:55.783
Though not everyone
accepts its accuracy,

20:55.860 --> 20:59.318
this book argues that
Nacinda and a fortune in gold

20:59.397 --> 21:01.991
were lost
in a shipwreck in 1522.

21:02.367 --> 21:04.961
Somewhere in
the vicinity of Descanto Bay.

21:05.937 --> 21:08.838
Devon, that's right
where Bobby was diving.

21:10.175 --> 21:11.369
Exactly.

21:13.978 --> 21:16.538
Our access to the Marquesa
is limited.

21:16.915 --> 21:19.008
That's your responsibility.

21:19.617 --> 21:21.517
Look, it shifted
during the night.

21:21.586 --> 21:24.146
You want to blame somethin',
blame the currents.

21:24.222 --> 21:26.053
The point is that
we ought to be using

21:26.124 --> 21:28.524
sand pumps and jacks,
not explosives.

21:28.960 --> 21:30.484
She's unstable now.

21:30.562 --> 21:32.792
The explosives are
gonna make it worse.

21:32.864 --> 21:35.162
You're getting
a triple share, Manley.

21:35.233 --> 21:36.894
That should be incentive
enough for you

21:36.968 --> 21:39.630
to accept a small
additional risk, shouldn't it?

21:40.171 --> 21:41.331
Ah!

21:45.510 --> 21:48.445
All right, set it for
65 feet and launch it.

22:04.028 --> 22:05.791
Sir! Sir!

22:05.997 --> 22:08.363
She's crumbling. She dropped
down to the lower reef.

22:08.433 --> 22:11.095
How deep?
About 120, 140 feet.

22:11.169 --> 22:14.195
We're gonna need heavier cable,
more hydraulics, and light.

22:14.372 --> 22:16.670
Get it.
You dive in the morning.

22:17.175 --> 22:21.578
You're talkin' about 140 feet down
in the worst possible conditions.

22:21.646 --> 22:25.173
You want me to die
for one lousy statue? Oh, no.

22:25.250 --> 22:28.014
I wouldn't expect a man
of your limited sensibilities

22:28.086 --> 22:31.886
to appreciate the historical
significance of Nacinda's discovery.

22:31.956 --> 22:33.184
So I won't
explain it to you.

22:33.258 --> 22:34.725
Just do what
you're hired to do.

22:43.401 --> 22:45.528
If they are moving Bobby
to intensive care,

22:45.603 --> 22:47.400
does that mean
he's conscious, Michael?

22:47.472 --> 22:48.632
Sure hope so, pal.

23:00.285 --> 23:02.617
Bobby. Bobby,
can you hear me?

23:02.687 --> 23:03.619
Jen...

23:03.788 --> 23:05.187
Jen, help-help me.

23:05.256 --> 23:07.690
I'm here, Bobby.
It's okay, I'm here with you.

23:09.127 --> 23:10.287
Cadiz.

23:10.361 --> 23:11.487
What?

23:11.996 --> 23:13.156
Cadiz.

23:13.932 --> 23:15.490
What's he sayin'?

23:15.800 --> 23:17.791
I don't know.
I can't make it out.

23:17.869 --> 23:20.337
I gotta get this guy
to ICU, kids.

23:21.172 --> 23:22.161
Sorry.

23:41.526 --> 23:42.652
KITT, I need some help.

23:43.962 --> 23:45.520
Give me your
Linguistics Department.

23:45.597 --> 23:46.859
Try this.

23:47.532 --> 23:50.000
Avast me hearties
or I'll run you through.

23:50.068 --> 23:51.592
Wrong program.

23:52.036 --> 23:55.335
It's a word I got out of
Bobby's semiconscious vocabulary.

23:55.440 --> 23:59.206
I'd like you to clean it up
for me. It's, uh, "cah-deesh,"

23:59.310 --> 24:01.744
or "kha-deesh"
or "ca-deesh. "

24:01.813 --> 24:03.280
Sounds like a sneeze.

24:03.381 --> 24:04.973
I'll get right to work on it.

24:05.049 --> 24:08.075
But it may take some time,
the variations are limitless.

24:08.319 --> 24:10.082
Devon's on, Michael.

24:10.288 --> 24:11.277
Devon.

24:11.356 --> 24:12.550
Big news, my boy.

24:12.624 --> 24:16.890
It seems Project Sea Life has no
contract whatsoever with the Fin Quest.

24:16.995 --> 24:20.692
And they have no reseeding
projects in the Descanto Bay area.

24:21.065 --> 24:23.329
Now, now, we're finally
getting somewhere.

24:23.401 --> 24:25.961
Michael, don't do
anything rash.

24:26.337 --> 24:27.429
You know me.

24:28.172 --> 24:29.196
Yes.

24:38.249 --> 24:40.581
Jack, cover up
those depth charges.

24:44.355 --> 24:48.155
I've seen that guy before hanging
around with Bobby's sister.

24:54.666 --> 24:55.758
Get rid of him.

25:05.376 --> 25:07.503
Hi.
Permission to come aboard?

25:08.079 --> 25:10.138
What can I do for you?
Well...

25:11.316 --> 25:13.079
Heard you were
reseeding the reef.

25:13.518 --> 25:14.610
Abs.

25:14.886 --> 25:16.148
I'm a diver.

25:16.220 --> 25:17.209
Uh-huh?

25:17.889 --> 25:19.880
Well, we don't need
anymore help.

25:19.957 --> 25:23.188
Well, you know, I've been divin'
along this coast for about 10 years.

25:23.261 --> 25:24.694
I've taken
a hell lot of abs.

25:24.762 --> 25:27.356
It's about time to put some
back in the pot, you know?

25:27.632 --> 25:28.656
Oh!

25:28.733 --> 25:30.724
Where, uh, where were
you certified?

25:30.802 --> 25:33.100
Uh, Special Forces.

25:36.874 --> 25:38.102
Tell you what.

25:38.876 --> 25:41.868
I'll plant those suckers all day
long. You give me bed and board, huh?

25:41.979 --> 25:43.640
The man's trying
to be polite to you.

25:43.715 --> 25:45.307
We don't
need you here.

25:45.383 --> 25:46.407
Time for you to leave.

25:46.484 --> 25:47.473
Oh.

25:48.319 --> 25:50.947
Well, if you put it that way.
See you around.

26:10.408 --> 26:13.241
Devon, I think we got
the beginning of a lead.

26:13.311 --> 26:16.303
That book, the one with
the picture of the statue.

26:16.414 --> 26:18.314
Yeah, Nacinda? What about it?

26:18.783 --> 26:21.980
On the dust jacket, there's a
picture of the author, isn't there?

26:22.053 --> 26:23.816
Yes. Zachary Sloate.

26:24.255 --> 26:25.347
Here.

26:26.090 --> 26:28.024
That's him.
I'm telling you, that's him.

26:28.092 --> 26:31.823
He's aboard the Fin Quest with that
local diver with the name of, uh, Manley.

26:31.896 --> 26:33.488
Can you get me
a run down on him?

26:33.564 --> 26:36.294
If you want to know if he's
dangerous, the answer is yes.

26:36.367 --> 26:39.700
Well, it sounds like we've got
just about half the lid nailed down,

26:39.771 --> 26:40.795
doesn't it?

26:40.905 --> 26:43.373
Well, Bobby Shell should be
able to give you the other half.

26:43.474 --> 26:45.408
He's, uh, not fully
conscious yet,

26:45.476 --> 26:47.307
but he is coming along
well enough

26:47.378 --> 26:49.175
that they've moved him
to a private room.

26:49.247 --> 26:50.714
Thanks, April.

26:55.787 --> 26:57.084
Why the rush, Michael?

26:57.155 --> 26:59.953
'Cause I got a hunch that
whoever tried to kill Bobby

27:00.024 --> 27:01.491
may try again, pal.

27:30.521 --> 27:32.216
End of the line, pal.

28:20.671 --> 28:22.730
KITT, meet me at the
back entrance right away.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.000
Aye, aye, mate.

28:34.252 --> 28:36.516
Which ambulance had only
one person in it, KITT?

28:36.587 --> 28:38.919
My sensors detect three people
in the westbound vehicle,

28:38.990 --> 28:40.890
and one in the northbound.

28:40.958 --> 28:42.323
Northbound.

29:25.236 --> 29:27.864
There's insufficient distance
for turbo boost, Michael.

29:27.972 --> 29:29.940
Pray for no
bumps and hold on.

30:19.857 --> 30:22.052
Michael,
you're awfully quiet,

30:23.527 --> 30:26.462
and upset despite my efforts
to cheer you up.

30:27.765 --> 30:30.825
I'm thinkin', KITT.
I'm not upset.

30:31.135 --> 30:33.968
Your pulse rate is up,
your blood pressure is high,

30:34.038 --> 30:36.905
and you're gripping the steering
wheel with alarming pressure.

30:39.076 --> 30:41.567
Yeah, white knuckles
give you away every time, huh?

30:41.679 --> 30:43.374
Perhaps this will help.

30:43.447 --> 30:44.436
What?

30:44.548 --> 30:45.981
Your funny word.

30:46.050 --> 30:47.608
It's been most difficult.

30:47.685 --> 30:50.483
The linguistics search
based on delirious ramblings

30:50.554 --> 30:52.454
isn't exactly direct access.

30:52.523 --> 30:54.388
KITT, just tell me
what it means, huh?

30:54.458 --> 30:56.221
It's pronounced "Cah-deez. "

30:56.293 --> 30:58.261
It's the name of
an ancient walled city.

30:58.329 --> 31:02.493
Great treasure was kept there and
periodically looted by the English.

31:02.600 --> 31:04.397
You may have
hit on something.

31:04.468 --> 31:06.333
I wanna check that out
with Jennifer.

31:06.404 --> 31:08.395
You have an attraction
to her, don't you?

31:08.472 --> 31:11.168
Um, she has a pretty smile.

31:12.143 --> 31:13.303
Don't you think so?

31:13.411 --> 31:16.005
Michael, silicon chip
circuitry is pretty to me.

31:16.113 --> 31:19.048
200 miles on a gallon
of gas is pretty to me.

31:19.116 --> 31:21.846
I'm not programmed
to react to a girl's smile.

31:21.919 --> 31:25.411
You, on the other hand, are
programmed to react to nothing else.

31:54.418 --> 31:57.353
I read no life signs
inside the building, Michael.

31:57.421 --> 31:59.355
But the dive boat's out, KITT.

32:00.091 --> 32:02.685
Jennifer said Bobby
did all the divin'.

32:06.664 --> 32:09.098
Michael, you have no idea
what's down there.

32:09.166 --> 32:10.929
It could be dangerous.

32:11.001 --> 32:12.628
What else is new?

33:25.042 --> 33:28.170
Michael,
what are you doing here?

33:31.248 --> 33:33.307
I was about to ask you
the same question.

33:37.021 --> 33:38.716
All right, Sloate.

33:38.856 --> 33:41.086
I found your damn
precious statue.

33:41.158 --> 33:42.955
Let's get it up
and get out of here.

33:43.027 --> 33:44.892
All right,
come on, let's pull it up.

33:52.002 --> 33:53.594
Why are you
looking at me like that?

33:53.671 --> 33:55.138
I thought we were
on the same team.

33:55.206 --> 33:57.197
We are!
Yeah. We are, huh?

33:57.308 --> 34:00.209
Except you forgot to tell me about
this place and all this treasure.

34:00.277 --> 34:02.142
Michael, I didn't know
anything about this.

34:02.213 --> 34:03.111
You're here!

34:03.214 --> 34:04.681
Yes, I'm here.

34:05.649 --> 34:07.640
I knew about this place.

34:08.418 --> 34:11.445
But what I don't know about
is this, the treasure.

34:11.522 --> 34:13.922
I don't know where it came
from or what's it doing here.

34:13.991 --> 34:15.822
I'm not buying any
of that, Jennifer.

34:15.893 --> 34:18.487
Bobby and I found this place
when we were kids.

34:19.029 --> 34:21.020
It was our secret place.

34:22.299 --> 34:24.027
Bobby named it Cadiz.

34:24.101 --> 34:27.127
Oh, so this is Cadiz, huh?

34:27.938 --> 34:29.929
Why didn't you tell me
that at the hospital?

34:30.040 --> 34:33.065
Because I didn't figure out that
was what he was trying to tell me,

34:33.177 --> 34:36.043
until after I got home.
I tried to reach you.

34:36.112 --> 34:37.080
And you couldn't,

34:37.181 --> 34:40.206
so you decided to come to your
little secret hiding place here

34:40.351 --> 34:42.614
and see what Bobby's mumblings
were all about?

34:42.686 --> 34:44.347
Yes, that's right.

34:46.123 --> 34:48.556
But I never
expected to find this.

34:49.293 --> 34:51.261
I can't imagine
how it got here.

34:51.328 --> 34:52.920
Try Bobby Shell.

34:53.364 --> 34:54.353
No.

34:54.431 --> 34:57.867
Quit protecting him, Jennifer. You're
not his mother, you're his sister.

34:57.935 --> 34:59.562
He's not a boy anymore,
he's a man.

34:59.637 --> 35:01.229
He's responsible
for his own actions.

35:01.305 --> 35:02.294
That's enough.

35:02.406 --> 35:03.464
Jennifer.
What?

35:03.574 --> 35:06.304
They tried to kill your
brother at the hospital again.

35:06.410 --> 35:07.434
Oh, no.

35:07.544 --> 35:10.138
He's okay. We have someone
keeping an eye on him.

35:10.514 --> 35:14.245
But I'm telling you we got to get these
guys before they really do kill Bobby.

35:15.786 --> 35:17.481
Michael, please,
I swear to you.

35:17.554 --> 35:19.954
I don't know
anything about this.

35:20.925 --> 35:23.723
All right, maybe you don't,
but Bobby does.

35:23.794 --> 35:26.319
We got to get
some answers from him.

35:31.201 --> 35:32.862
Back on the same team?

35:34.505 --> 35:35.631
Yeah.

35:45.950 --> 35:47.679
Gently. Now, gently.

35:57.461 --> 35:59.053
Open it. Open it.

36:13.410 --> 36:14.638
The kid.

36:17.181 --> 36:18.409
The kid.

36:27.958 --> 36:29.323
Freezin'?
I'm freezing.

36:29.393 --> 36:30.325
All right.

36:30.394 --> 36:31.827
I'll get a couple
of towels, okay?

36:31.895 --> 36:33.362
You got it. Go.

36:35.766 --> 36:37.097
Hey, KITT.

36:37.334 --> 36:38.801
Aye, me hearty.

36:38.869 --> 36:41.235
Is it a ration of grog
you're needin'?

36:41.305 --> 36:42.329
Grog?

36:42.439 --> 36:43.963
Aye, grog.

36:44.241 --> 36:46.141
Rum to you landlubbers.

36:46.310 --> 36:48.801
Oh, no. You're not back on
that program again, are you?

36:48.912 --> 36:50.777
Well, more to the point,
I suppose.

36:50.848 --> 36:52.645
April phoned
from the hospital.

36:52.716 --> 36:55.014
Bobby's alert
and able to talk.

36:55.119 --> 36:56.984
Good.
I hope his memory's workin'.

36:57.454 --> 37:00.048
I got a lot of
questions to ask him.

37:00.791 --> 37:02.554
Here. Oh.

37:02.793 --> 37:03.851
Good news.

37:05.129 --> 37:06.721
I just got a call.

37:07.698 --> 37:08.790
A call?

37:08.866 --> 37:10.697
Yeah. Car phone.

37:11.168 --> 37:12.157
Oh.

37:13.137 --> 37:14.229
Bobby's awake.
Oh.

37:14.304 --> 37:15.430
He's doing great.

37:15.506 --> 37:17.633
Oh, that's fantastic.
Can we go and see him?

37:17.741 --> 37:20.403
Sooner the better.
Oh, right now.

37:20.511 --> 37:21.944
Let me get some
clothes for him.

37:22.012 --> 37:24.810
And I'll-I'll, uh, take his
car and meet you there, okay?

37:26.050 --> 37:27.312
Michael,

37:30.020 --> 37:31.248
thanks.

37:32.623 --> 37:33.681
Michael.

37:33.757 --> 37:34.746
Yeah, KITT.

37:34.825 --> 37:37.658
You're right.
She does have a nice smile.

37:38.796 --> 37:40.320
Yeah, she does.

37:59.216 --> 38:01.013
Uh, oh, Bobby.

38:10.094 --> 38:11.925
Michael, is that you?

38:31.381 --> 38:32.848
That is mine.

38:55.939 --> 38:57.201
Well, how's the patient?

38:57.307 --> 38:58.365
Better.

38:58.475 --> 39:00.067
Well, he's asked me
out twice.

39:00.177 --> 39:01.439
Does that
answer your question?

39:01.512 --> 39:02.638
Yeah, that will do.

39:02.746 --> 39:04.008
Well, have fun.

39:04.114 --> 39:06.844
This guy's idea of a straight
answer is a right angle.

39:06.884 --> 39:10.081
Unless you want
to know about, uh, fast cars,

39:10.154 --> 39:14.250
hot surf boards and, uh, what real
women should wear to the beach.

39:14.892 --> 39:16.086
April.
Hmm?

39:16.226 --> 39:19.161
Listen. Thanks a lot for jumpin'
in when I needed some help.

39:19.229 --> 39:21.254
Sure. Actually, it was fun.

39:21.465 --> 39:22.693
I, um,

39:22.799 --> 39:26.132
I was thinking maybe we should
trade jobs once in a while.

39:26.203 --> 39:27.830
That's not a bad idea.

39:27.905 --> 39:31.170
KITT's Long John Silver
quotes are driving me nuts.

39:36.480 --> 39:38.209
Well, I don't know
what to say.

39:38.949 --> 39:41.884
What do you say to a guy
who saved your life?

39:42.119 --> 39:43.313
Thanks.

39:43.487 --> 39:44.886
Thanks will do.

39:45.656 --> 39:47.556
But we need to talk, Bobby.

39:48.492 --> 39:49.857
About what?

39:51.428 --> 39:54.329
About who tried
to kill you and why.

39:55.098 --> 39:57.123
Kill me?
I- I had a diving accident.

39:57.201 --> 39:58.668
I don't have time
for that.

39:59.269 --> 40:01.601
I don't have the time
or patience for that.

40:01.738 --> 40:03.865
Jennifer took on the burden
after your dad died.

40:03.974 --> 40:05.441
I took on
another piece of it,

40:05.542 --> 40:08.511
when the people who are after
you tried to kill you right here.

40:08.579 --> 40:11.275
Now it's your turn, man.
You give something back, huh?

40:16.153 --> 40:17.916
I know about Cadiz.

40:18.522 --> 40:19.819
I've been there.

40:19.990 --> 40:21.218
I've seen your stash.

40:21.291 --> 40:22.918
Okay, what do you
want from me?

40:22.993 --> 40:24.426
How about the truth?

40:27.564 --> 40:30.362
I went out about a week ago
to poach some abs.

40:30.434 --> 40:34.370
I was following a reef when I saw
some of those guys from the Fin Quest.

40:34.438 --> 40:36.338
They weren't reseeding abs.

40:36.440 --> 40:38.135
They were diving an old wreck.

40:38.242 --> 40:39.709
When they left,
I checked it out.

40:39.776 --> 40:41.403
It was loaded with treasure.

40:41.778 --> 40:45.646
Which you helped yourself to
and stashed at Cadiz.

40:46.583 --> 40:47.811
Most of it, yeah.

40:47.884 --> 40:49.078
Most of it?

40:49.152 --> 40:51.950
Cadiz was a transfer point.
I- I took a lot of it home.

40:52.022 --> 40:53.046
Like what?

40:53.123 --> 40:56.058
Just trinkets and
a beautiful gold statue.

40:56.627 --> 40:59.425
I took it out of this box and
switched it with some rocks.

41:00.264 --> 41:01.492
It's Nacinda!

41:16.880 --> 41:18.575
Jennifer!

41:18.882 --> 41:20.850
Jennifer, where are you?

41:35.999 --> 41:36.988
KITT!

41:38.368 --> 41:39.665
What is it, Michael?

41:39.736 --> 41:41.203
Trouble, pal. Real trouble.

41:41.271 --> 41:42.329
Get Devon for me.

41:44.474 --> 41:45.498
Yes, Michael.

41:45.609 --> 41:49.045
Devon, have you got the Coast
Guard en route to Fin Quest yet?

41:49.112 --> 41:52.513
They're still trying to locate a federal
judge to sign the boarding papers.

41:52.582 --> 41:54.209
We're running out of time.

41:55.185 --> 41:58.951
I'm gonna board myself.
Wish me luck, huh?

41:59.022 --> 42:01.320
Michael,
don't do anything foolish.

42:01.391 --> 42:03.256
Michael! Michael!

42:07.331 --> 42:09.424
My sensors indicate
the anchor is up, Michael.

42:09.499 --> 42:12.161
In that case,
prepare to get wet, pal.

42:12.235 --> 42:13.827
You can't be serious.

42:13.904 --> 42:15.929
Sloate's serious
and he's got Jennifer.

42:16.039 --> 42:17.370
But you heard April.

42:17.474 --> 42:19.908
There are unanswered questions
regarding the viability

42:19.976 --> 42:22.103
of my Third Stage
Aquatic Synthesizer.

42:22.212 --> 42:25.204
Maybe we'll answer 'em here
and now, me hearty.

42:25.315 --> 42:28.079
Michael, this is clearly
no time for Long John Silver!

42:38.895 --> 42:40.385
Whoa!

42:43.734 --> 42:45.895
You didn't sink, buddy.
You didn't sink.

42:45.969 --> 42:47.061
No thanks to you.

42:59.449 --> 43:00.609
Hey, Sloate!

43:05.422 --> 43:08.448
I don't believe it!
There's a car on the water!

43:09.393 --> 43:11.258
Use the depth charges!

43:12.396 --> 43:13.488
Full speed ahead!

43:13.563 --> 43:16.293
Put it on automatic pilot.
Come on down and help us.

43:16.366 --> 43:19.335
Whoa! Let's do it
for April, buddy.

43:27.511 --> 43:28.739
Clear! Fire!

43:35.819 --> 43:37.081
Depth charges!

43:37.220 --> 43:39.518
Michael, this is above
and beyond the call of duty.

43:39.589 --> 43:41.557
Zigzag, KITT! Zigzag!

43:41.625 --> 43:43.058
Easy for you to say.

43:43.126 --> 43:44.058
Fire!

43:49.399 --> 43:50.457
Get ready, pal.

43:50.534 --> 43:53.025
All right.
Get me alongside of her.

43:54.137 --> 43:55.968
You gotta hold her steady.

43:56.740 --> 43:58.708
Can you override their
electronic auto pilot?

43:58.775 --> 44:00.936
Anything to get back
where I belong.

44:14.758 --> 44:16.123
How's it coming, KITT?

44:16.193 --> 44:18.491
Electronic pilot
override established.

44:33.143 --> 44:34.337
Get him!

44:40.083 --> 44:41.141
Oh, yeah.

45:01.605 --> 45:03.402
KITT, hard to starboard.

45:03.507 --> 45:04.906
Aye, aye, Captain.

45:18.355 --> 45:19.344
Catch.

45:23.026 --> 45:25.119
Michael, are you all right?

45:25.529 --> 45:27.497
Yeah, I'm fine.

45:27.898 --> 45:29.729
Are you okay?
I'm okay.

45:30.267 --> 45:31.632
Good work, KITT.

45:31.801 --> 45:33.234
Real good work.

45:33.370 --> 45:34.394
Who's KITT?

45:34.538 --> 45:36.733
He's a, uh...

45:36.840 --> 45:38.137
He's a friend of mine.

45:39.376 --> 45:42.402
Whoever he is, I'd like to
thank him myself. May I?

45:42.512 --> 45:43.706
Be my guest.

45:45.015 --> 45:46.607
You were wonderful,
KITT.

45:46.683 --> 45:49.618
Just call me
the Scourge of the seven seas.

45:50.153 --> 45:53.145
Steer for home, Scourge.
Steer for home.

45:53.223 --> 45:54.588
Aye, aye, Captain.

45:55.258 --> 45:56.987
Now I'd like to
thank you.

46:21.484 --> 46:23.816
Am I ever going
to see you again, Michael?

46:23.887 --> 46:25.980
You kiddin'?
The way you cook the lobster,

46:26.056 --> 46:27.114
just keep
the butter warm.

46:29.459 --> 46:32.223
You know, I don't know
what it was you said to Bobby.

46:32.295 --> 46:35.492
But it looks like the third
Shell is finally on board.

46:36.066 --> 46:38.261
Take care of yourself, huh?
Yeah.

46:38.335 --> 46:40.200
Do me a favor,
take care of your sister.

46:40.270 --> 46:43.262
Okay. Hey, next time you're by we'll
go divin'. I got a terrific spot.

46:43.340 --> 46:45.900
Yeah, I bet you do.
Uh, look, uh, no gold.

46:46.009 --> 46:47.408
Just fish.

46:47.477 --> 46:48.535
You got it.

46:48.645 --> 46:49.907
All right.

46:51.081 --> 46:53.413
Michael, I want to thank you,

46:55.685 --> 46:56.811
for everything.

46:56.886 --> 46:57.978
Thank you.

46:58.421 --> 47:00.685
Did I ever tell you,
you got a pretty smile?

47:00.757 --> 47:01.746
Oh, yeah?

47:02.926 --> 47:03.984
Bye.

47:06.229 --> 47:07.423
Bye, Michael.

47:07.497 --> 47:08.486
Bye.

47:11.101 --> 47:12.625
Back to nursing KITT, huh?

47:12.702 --> 47:14.294
Electronically speaking.

47:14.704 --> 47:17.969
I'm pulling his water wings.
He's lucky he didn't sink.

47:19.042 --> 47:20.634
You're both lucky.

47:22.245 --> 47:24.110
This synthesizer's faulty,

47:24.180 --> 47:25.807
and there will be
no more aquatics

47:25.882 --> 47:28.112
until the entire system
has been rebuilt

47:28.284 --> 47:29.512
from scratch.

47:31.988 --> 47:34.718
Just when I was beginning
to enjoy the water, too.

47:34.791 --> 47:36.918
No more swimming
for you, buddy.

47:37.327 --> 47:39.557
I see you're
lifting the anchor.

47:39.763 --> 47:41.560
About to get
underway are we, matey?

47:41.631 --> 47:42.893
KITT.

47:45.402 --> 47:47.029
Michael, I do believe
April is becoming

47:47.103 --> 47:49.003
more parent than
technician to me.

47:49.439 --> 47:50.906
Why do you say that, KITT?

47:51.007 --> 47:53.942
Well, when I objected to the
water, I was told to go in.

47:54.010 --> 47:57.036
Now that I've begun to like
it, I'm told to stay out.

47:57.147 --> 47:58.614
Isn't that motherly?

47:59.482 --> 48:00.506
Motherly?

48:00.583 --> 48:01.743
You got that right.

48:01.818 --> 48:03.445
Mother...
Listen, you two...
