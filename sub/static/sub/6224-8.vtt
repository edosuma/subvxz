00:02.544 --> 00:05.877
Great dragon:
In a land of myth and a time of magic...

00:06.048 --> 00:11.008
The destiny of a great kingdom
rests on the shoulders of a young man.

00:11.178 --> 00:14.386
His name: Merlin.

00:31.323 --> 00:32.732
Ah!

00:42.709 --> 00:44.119
Leon: Stop.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.747
Show yourself.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.632
Oh, he's just a boy.

00:52.803 --> 00:56.170
- Out here in the middle of the night?
- There's no need for your sword.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.765
Come.

01:02.354 --> 01:03.639
Where are you going?

01:03.814 --> 01:06.726
- Been catching frogs.
- Frogs?

01:06.900 --> 01:10.142
It's a full moon, Leon. We used to do it.

01:10.946 --> 01:12.777
Come on, you should be in bed. Off you go.

01:12.948 --> 01:13.983
Thank you, my lady.

01:26.587 --> 01:31.126
Oh, Arthur, that is so sweet.
You've gone to all this trouble.

01:31.592 --> 01:33.628
And gillyflowers, my favorite.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.417
- You remembered.
- Mm-hm_

01:35.596 --> 01:38.178
- Have you missed me? Heh.
- Mm_

01:39.474 --> 01:42.307
Merlin, uh, it's late.
You should probably get some sleep.

01:42.477 --> 01:43.933
Thank you, sire.

01:44.521 --> 01:49.265
Oh, Merlin, before you go,
I'd love a hot bath.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.313
Certainly, my lady.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.269
- Who are you?
- My name is daegal.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.244
- How'd you get in here?
- It wasn't difficult

02:34.363 --> 02:36.649
- really? Get out.
- Please, it's my sister.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.343
- She's sick. She needs a physician.
- Well, bring her to Gaius.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.401
I can't. It's too dangerous for our kind.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.447
I need you to come with me.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.912
She needs your help or she will die.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.077
I'm not a physician.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.875
In

02:58.595 --> 03:01.553
She's only 6. She has
the sweating sickness.

03:01.723 --> 03:04.180
I'm begging you. You are her only chance.

03:04.351 --> 03:07.593
- How far is she?
- The valley of the fallen kings.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.386
That's more than half a day away.

03:09.564 --> 03:12.226
She won't last much longer.
You must come now.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.061
No can't

03:17.072 --> 03:18.528
I can't.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.774
I have risked my life to save her.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.702
Please tell me it was not in vain.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.500
(Go. Get out of here. Go.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.036
Will you help her?

03:40.971 --> 03:42.802
Meet me

03:43.724 --> 03:47.888
at the entrance to the darkling woods
at first light.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.013
You don't even know who this boy is.

04:28.185 --> 04:31.302
He's a druid. Gaius: Who broke
into the castle like a thief.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.266
How else was he going to reach me?

04:33.940 --> 04:36.522
A journey to the valley
of the fallen kings, Merlin?

04:36.693 --> 04:40.436
- It's a den of murderers, cutthroats.
- It is dangerous.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.821
It's a long way north of dangerous.

04:42.991 --> 04:44.856
What am I supposed to
do, let this girl die?

04:46.369 --> 04:49.169
The journey there and back is going
to take you the best part of a day.

04:49.331 --> 04:52.869
- How are you going to keep it from Arthur?
- I'm sure you'll think of something.

04:55.420 --> 04:58.332
- Me?
- Sarrum of amata is arriving today.

04:59.508 --> 05:02.170
Arthur will be too busy
to notice where I am.

05:03.804 --> 05:04.839
Merlin

05:11.186 --> 05:14.678
I promised the boy
and I can't go back on it now.

05:17.192 --> 05:18.432
I'll be back by nightfall.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.245
Sorry I'm late.

05:36.419 --> 05:39.707
- I thought you weren't coming.
- I was getting you some breakfast.

05:40.298 --> 05:43.461
- It's fresh.
- It's good of you to do this.

05:43.635 --> 05:46.172
I only hope I can help your sister.

05:46.555 --> 05:48.261
- Won't you get in trouble?
- Nope.

05:48.431 --> 05:50.046
But you're the king's servant.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.967
Arthur won't even notice I'm gone.

05:53.144 --> 05:54.350
Arthur: Merlin.

05:58.108 --> 06:00.144
Merlin. “What is it?

06:01.736 --> 06:03.192
I can't find my comb.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.571
- Have you looked?
- Everywhere.

06:11.872 --> 06:14.113
It must have been under something.
Your nose.

06:15.417 --> 06:17.282
You just have this way of seeing things.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.325
Yes, two of them. They're called eyes.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.795
- Very beautiful they are too.
- Don't try and get out of this.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.173
- Out of what?
- How hopeless you are.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.549
I am. I'm hopelessly in love.

06:29.014 --> 06:31.596
You need to prepare for
the sarrum"s arrival.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.176
Oh, yes.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.685
That unh.

06:38.148 --> 06:44.360
Do you know where my robe... s are?

06:49.326 --> 06:50.862
Arthur: Merlin.

06:51.036 --> 06:53.778
Uh, he's garnering herbs, sire.

06:55.749 --> 06:59.082
- Well, I need him, now.
- Well, he may be some time.

07:00.003 --> 07:03.541
- Where is he?
- He's gone in pursuit of a young agrimonia.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.580
- A what?
- Agrimonia, sire.

07:05.759 --> 07:10.594
A noble but shy plant, not easy to find.
It could take him all day.

07:10.764 --> 07:11.799
All day?

07:13.141 --> 07:15.177
It is invaluable, sire.

07:15.352 --> 07:18.890
Its properties open up
both the liver and the spleen.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.804
He's in the tavern, isn't he?

07:21.399 --> 07:22.434
No, sire.

07:22.609 --> 07:25.089
Well, when he's finished opening up
his liver and his spleen...

07:25.236 --> 07:27.727
Tell him he has one hour to sober up
and get to my chambers.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.487
We have a guest to prepare for.

07:37.332 --> 07:38.663
Here

07:42.796 --> 07:44.036
daegal: Ah

07:44.714 --> 07:45.954
what's wrong?

07:46.132 --> 07:48.839
I fell getting into the citadel.

07:49.219 --> 07:50.800
Here, let me have a look.

07:50.971 --> 07:53.883
It's my sister that needs
caring for, not me.

07:55.517 --> 07:56.973
Wait

07:58.937 --> 08:02.771
we have a long journey ahead of us.
You don't want this getting any worse.

08:02.941 --> 08:06.354
Comfrey will help stop the blood flow,
take away the swelling.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.063
Where'd you learn all this?

08:09.364 --> 08:10.695
(Saius.

08:11.449 --> 08:13.906
When I first came to Camelot,
he took me in...

08:14.911 --> 08:16.867
Taught me everything that I know.

08:20.041 --> 08:24.250
- What about you, your family?
- I only have a sister.

08:25.088 --> 08:28.501
- Your parents?
- My mother's dead.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.087
She was a druid too?

08:33.888 --> 08:36.345
Hmm, Gaius taught you well.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.006
You're lucky to have him.

08:40.602 --> 08:41.638
I am.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.556
Come on.

08:50.488 --> 08:51.898
Arthur: Yes?

08:54.117 --> 08:56.574
- Where is he?
- He's still not returned.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.527
How am I meant to get dressed?

09:00.582 --> 09:03.619
Heh, well, surely that's
not too difficult, sire.

09:04.085 --> 09:06.371
Really”? You think you can do it?

09:10.175 --> 09:11.711
Right. Come on then, Gaius.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.474
Shirt.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.848
Quickly.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.863
What are you doing? “It's stuck.

09:44.042 --> 09:46.124
- It can't be.
- It's too small.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.289
It's Guinevere's night dress.

09:55.637 --> 09:58.037
Daegal: I tell you, if I catch
this fly, I'm going to eat it.

09:58.181 --> 10:01.548
Heh. Here, be better for you.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.228
Heh here.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.724
- Don't you like them?
- Yeah, they're my favorite.

10:10.902 --> 10:13.018
Then why are you giving it to me?

10:13.196 --> 10:15.608
I don't need it. I had a big breakfast.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.738
Why are you being like this?

10:17.992 --> 10:22.531
People I've met, they're not like you.
They don't care.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.366
I don't matter.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.538
I never think that

10:26.709 --> 10:27.869
we all matter.

10:29.212 --> 10:30.918
Have a drink.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.339
- Thank you.
- Come on.

11:08.042 --> 11:09.907
Gaius: You're very quiet, sire.

11:11.296 --> 11:12.502
Can you blame me?

11:12.672 --> 11:15.254
Sarrum does have a reputation.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.131
Even my father feared him.

11:17.719 --> 11:19.675
They say he takes joy in impaling men.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.928
Not just men, sire.

11:23.057 --> 11:25.173
Women and children too.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.843
He also has a fondness
for assassinating his friends.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.808
I doubt we'll ever be that close.

11:31.733 --> 11:35.271
Although we do share one thing:
Our hatred for morgana.

11:35.445 --> 11:38.403
So you've heard the rumors.
He once had her under lock and key.

11:38.573 --> 11:40.279
I'm hoping he'll tell us more.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.405
Given the sarrum's reputation...

11:44.579 --> 11:47.412
Are you certain it's wise
to seek an alliance?

11:47.582 --> 11:50.915
If we're to achieve peace in the five
kingdoms, we've got little choice.

11:51.419 --> 11:52.979
I don't agree with his regime, Gaius...

11:53.129 --> 11:55.871
But dealing with him may be
the only way of achieving our aims.

11:56.090 --> 11:58.422
You're right, of course.

11:59.928 --> 12:04.763
You are becoming a true statesman, Arthur.
I hope you realize that.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.264
I'm gonna be late.

12:06.434 --> 12:11.394
I'll tell you this, Gaius, the sarrum wouldn't
put up with an idle-brained servant like Merlin.

12:11.564 --> 12:13.475
He's a lot to answer for.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.478
He certainly has.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.988
What is it? Your arm?

12:32.710 --> 12:33.910
We need to get to your sister.

12:38.049 --> 12:40.256
When you last saw her...

12:41.177 --> 12:42.212
How bad was she?

12:43.137 --> 12:45.674
I told you, the life had
nearly gone from her.

12:48.935 --> 12:51.051
Here, I don't want it.

13:29.600 --> 13:32.091
Merlin: Daegal, bandits.

13:33.604 --> 13:34.639
Get down!

13:37.150 --> 13:38.765
What are you doing? Shh!

13:42.238 --> 13:44.399
You hear me? No.

13:48.036 --> 13:51.324
Thank you. You saved my life.

13:52.874 --> 13:54.614
We're not safe yet.

13:58.212 --> 14:02.080
Come on. The sooner we get
to your sister, the better.

14:20.068 --> 14:23.151
We are most grateful to the sarrum
for accepting our invitation...

14:23.988 --> 14:26.400
Gracing our palace with his presence.

14:26.574 --> 14:30.863
We welcome him and his warriors
with friendship.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.945
The last time I met you,
you were 10 years old.

14:35.416 --> 14:38.283
Uther held a tournament in your honor.

14:39.087 --> 14:41.078
I fight in my own tournaments now.

14:41.255 --> 14:44.543
Well, we shall enjoy
putting you to the test.

14:49.931 --> 14:53.674
We're here.
She's just the other side of those trees.

14:54.602 --> 14:55.682
What's wrong?

14:55.853 --> 14:58.970
Nothing. I just hope she's still alive.

15:09.951 --> 15:11.282
There's no one here.

15:13.663 --> 15:15.619
Why have you brought me here?
What is this?

15:15.790 --> 15:19.032
I can explain.
You're not a druid.

15:23.673 --> 15:25.254
Who are you?

15:33.474 --> 15:34.884
Morgana: You've done well

15:35.309 --> 15:38.972
I knew it wouldn't be difficult.
Merlin has a weakness for outcasts.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.519
Especially druids.

15:43.568 --> 15:45.559
Why are you doing this?

15:45.736 --> 15:49.024
Because Merlin has meddled
in my plans once too often.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.240
The agony you feel?

15:56.539 --> 15:58.655
You'll be glad when death comes.

16:12.597 --> 16:15.509
- Are you really going to kill the king?
- Hold your tongue.

16:16.601 --> 16:17.761
Not a word of this to anyone.

16:18.853 --> 16:21.390
You're forgetting I still
have a few drops left.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.986
Arthur:
I feel we have much in common.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.120
We share many allies and friends.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.623
Also an enemy.

16:44.837 --> 16:45.997
Sorcery.

16:48.591 --> 16:52.755
There is a rumor
that you held morgana prisoner.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.886
Is it true?

16:56.599 --> 16:58.510
She's nothing to be feared.

17:00.144 --> 17:03.261
I kept her like an animal.

17:06.317 --> 17:10.435
How did you capture her?
She's a sorceress, a high priestess.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.480
I found her weakness.

17:14.032 --> 17:18.617
Everyone has one, even a high priestess.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.744
A young dragon.

17:23.792 --> 17:26.125
Her love for that creature

17:26.587 --> 17:30.455
caused her to suffer
more than she ever imagined possible.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.670
But not more than she deserved.

17:42.770 --> 17:46.558
I knew that she wouldn't dare
to use magic against me...

17:46.732 --> 17:51.442
Not while her beloved creature
was at risk of harm.

17:52.154 --> 17:53.690
Such a shame.

17:53.864 --> 17:57.652
All that power, all that beauty...

17:57.827 --> 18:03.538
Abandoned and forgotten
in a living grave.

18:15.886 --> 18:18.377
You're a harsh judge, lord sarrum.

18:18.556 --> 18:21.764
When it comes to sorcery,
we must be merciless.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.225
I was not merciless enough.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.266
Morgana escaped.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.477
A lapse on my part.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.937
I'll not be so foolish again.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.571
Not that her time with me
was entirely wasted.

18:37.742 --> 18:40.074
As the dragon grew...

18:40.786 --> 18:43.448
The pit became too small.

18:43.831 --> 18:50.122
Gradually the creature
was crippled and twisted.

18:50.838 --> 18:53.500
At night, you could hear its cries.

18:54.383 --> 18:57.671
They were even more heartbreaking
than morgana.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.422
I hope the sarrum will forgive me
if I retire for the night.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.122
My lady.

19:40.638 --> 19:43.175
- What of Merlin?
- He's gone to his death...

19:43.349 --> 19:45.590
Along with everything he knows.

19:46.435 --> 19:49.472
- And the sarrum?
- He's feasting with Arthur as we speak.

19:49.647 --> 19:51.183
Then we must act quickly.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.857
We cannot afford an alliance
between amata and Camelot

19:55.027 --> 19:57.313
it would put the throne
beyond my reach forever.

19:58.948 --> 20:01.530
What is troubling you?
The sarrum.

20:02.243 --> 20:04.603
Are we right to enlist such a man?
Is there not another way?

20:04.745 --> 20:07.111
Do you not see how perfect this plan is?

20:07.289 --> 20:09.245
The sarrum's reputation precedes him.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.913
There's no deadlier assassin
in the five kingdoms.

20:13.254 --> 20:15.336
Arthur will not stand a chance.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.588
You're sure he'll agree?

20:17.758 --> 20:20.124
You're forgetting how well I know this man.

20:20.720 --> 20:24.258
For two years, his was
the only voice I heard.

20:25.558 --> 20:29.301
I know the sarrum. I
know his lust for power.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.557
And he will not refuse your offer.

20:33.524 --> 20:36.482
He will think he can control you,
but he will reckon without me.

20:38.362 --> 20:39.568
And once Arthur is dead?

20:41.365 --> 20:44.448
The knights will turn on your guest
and make you their queen.

20:46.328 --> 20:47.738
But you must promise me something.

20:50.708 --> 20:54.041
You must make sure the sarrum's
last moments are filled with agony.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.753
It will be my pleasure.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.621
You're much better at this than (gaius.

23:37.791 --> 23:41.375
- I was a servant, remember?
- You were always much more than that.

23:41.545 --> 23:44.287
Arthur: Unh. - Stop moving then.

23:45.799 --> 23:48.336
Ow. I want Merlin back where is he?

23:48.510 --> 23:50.546
You mustn't be hard on him.

23:51.305 --> 23:52.920
I am a bit worried.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.384
You don't think something's
happened to him, do you?

23:56.101 --> 23:58.183
He's probably overworked.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.641
Maybe you just once let him enjoy himself?

24:03.067 --> 24:04.182
You're right.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.523
Besides, you've got more important things
to worry about.

24:11.617 --> 24:13.357
There.

25:21.895 --> 25:22.930
You fight bravely.

25:27.985 --> 25:30.476
Your man wields a sword
better than any fighter I've ever met.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.144
I trained him myself.

25:32.948 --> 25:36.281
- Perhaps one day I'll teach you.
- I'd be honored.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.092
Sarrum: My lady.

25:59.266 --> 26:01.106
Your man showed great skill
to beat my husband.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.884
The men of amata are born
with swords in their hands.

26:04.063 --> 26:07.351
I can't help but believe that Camelot
would benefit from a leader like you.

26:07.524 --> 26:08.559
Sarrum: Hmm.

26:08.734 --> 26:10.850
You should've let him die.

26:16.617 --> 26:19.529
- I must have misheard you.
- I don't think so.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.193
You aren't happy with your husband?

26:21.371 --> 26:23.407
I'd be happy if he died tomorrow.

26:24.625 --> 26:28.994
Someone who can make that happen, I would
ensure that they were richly rewarded.

26:30.214 --> 26:32.421
I'm not sure I believe you.

26:33.175 --> 26:36.793
Hmm. Meet me outside
the king's solar tonight.

26:36.970 --> 26:38.835
We can speak openly there.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.324
Daegal.: Come on.

27:22.766 --> 27:25.428
You... you came back. Why?

27:25.602 --> 27:27.638
I couldn't leave you to die.

27:32.818 --> 27:34.979
- You're too late.
- No, I can help.

27:35.154 --> 27:38.317
- You're a physician. You tell me what to do.
- There's nothing.

27:38.824 --> 27:42.737
There must be a cure. You tell me which
herbs and I'll find them for you.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.287
Come on, what do we need?

27:51.503 --> 27:52.709
Rue.

27:54.256 --> 27:57.123
- It's got yellow flowers.
- And feathery leaves.

27:57.301 --> 27:59.383
Milfoll. Yarrow?

27:59.553 --> 28:01.635
Ground into a tincture.

28:05.934 --> 28:07.470
Hurry.

28:08.604 --> 28:10.265
Hurry.

28:29.917 --> 28:30.952
Here

28:45.307 --> 28:46.843
Here

29:28.225 --> 29:29.590
Gaius: Sire?

29:30.769 --> 29:32.350
Arthur?

29:33.272 --> 29:34.387
(Saius.

29:35.732 --> 29:38.895
- What is it?
- I was looking for the king.

29:39.820 --> 29:42.186
He's at a meeting at the council chambers.

29:42.364 --> 29:43.695
Can I help?

29:44.574 --> 29:49.193
Merlin.
I haven't seen him since yesterday morning.

29:49.371 --> 29:50.986
Oh, dear.

29:51.832 --> 29:53.914
I do hope there isn't anything wrong.

29:55.210 --> 29:59.954
I was wondering, perhaps,
if we should send out a search party.

30:00.132 --> 30:02.339
I'm sure there's no need just yet...

30:03.093 --> 30:04.674
Especially with the sarrum here.

30:04.845 --> 30:08.337
Given his reputation, I think it best
we keep the Garrison at full strength.

30:10.726 --> 30:11.932
Indeed.

30:17.024 --> 30:20.767
- I'll ask the servants if they've seen him.
- Thank you, milady.

30:33.123 --> 30:35.990
Forgive me, I was waylaid.

30:36.293 --> 30:37.453
Speak.

30:37.627 --> 30:39.208
I have a simple proposition.

30:40.047 --> 30:41.878
One that would be mutually beneficial.

30:43.175 --> 30:45.507
You kill Arthur, I assume the throne...

30:46.261 --> 30:50.595
And in gratitude give over one-third
of Camelot's lands to amata.

30:51.016 --> 30:53.302
You think the people will accept this?

30:53.477 --> 30:57.436
Without a king, I will insist that it's
a necessary price for our protection.

30:58.190 --> 31:01.148
- And the knights?
- They will remain loyal to me.

31:01.318 --> 31:04.435
- They'll do whatever I say.
- How do we kill him?

31:04.613 --> 31:07.821
The king is surrounded
by armed guards at all times.

31:07.991 --> 31:09.197
Guards who answer to me.

31:09.951 --> 31:12.738
You appoint the assassin,
I will deliver the means.

31:15.332 --> 31:17.163
I have just the man.

31:18.168 --> 31:19.999
Then make him ready.

31:20.629 --> 31:22.995
Arthur has proposed a treaty.

31:23.173 --> 31:27.291
The signing tomorrow will provide us
with the perfect opportunity.

31:50.867 --> 31:52.357
You're alive.

32:06.591 --> 32:09.253
You have to believe me.
I did not know what morgana intended.

32:11.471 --> 32:13.257
You betrayed me.

32:13.432 --> 32:16.014
She offered me money.
You've seen what it's like.

32:19.813 --> 32:22.850
Do you know what morgana is planning?
No.

32:23.775 --> 32:27.063
I met the lady morgana
and the queen only once.

32:28.321 --> 32:29.686
I don't believe you.

32:33.076 --> 32:34.737
Please, whatever you know.

32:37.706 --> 32:40.118
I think they mean to kill the king.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.212
What are you doing?

32:48.675 --> 32:50.961
Well, I need to warn Arthur
before it's too late.

33:02.647 --> 33:03.932
Ah!

33:09.946 --> 33:11.277
Bandits.

33:14.326 --> 33:15.611
They don't see us. No.

33:15.785 --> 33:18.401
- We'll edge around the outside.
- They'll have lookouts.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.286
We don't have a choice.

33:20.457 --> 33:22.618
We need to get back to Camelot.

33:42.812 --> 33:46.930
- I can look after myself. Get to safety.
- I'm not going to leave you this time.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.898
If you value your lives...

33:58.745 --> 34:00.451
You won't take another step.

34:00.622 --> 34:02.078
What are you doing? “Trust me.

34:03.500 --> 34:06.492
Here, it's all the money we have.

34:06.670 --> 34:09.581
You, empty your pockets.

34:09.755 --> 34:11.587
I ast chance.

34:13.009 --> 34:14.418
You don't even have a sword.

34:17.347 --> 34:19.507
I don't need one.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.360
Let's go.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.498
- My lady, how good to see you.
- I trust you passed a pleasant night.

34:47.668 --> 34:49.375
Most agreeable.

34:52.882 --> 34:56.545
Arthur will be dead by sundown.

34:56.719 --> 35:02.511
And then all that stands in our way
is a serving girl...

35:02.684 --> 35:05.300
Who plays at being a queen.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.856
Daegal: You have magic, Merlin.
Yes

35:12.027 --> 35:13.813
and you live in Camelot.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.148
- Does anyone know?
- Only Gaius.

35:16.323 --> 35:17.733
Not Arthur? No.

35:18.617 --> 35:21.233
And if he ever found out,
he'd probably hang me.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.652
- But you still help him.
- I have to. It's my job.

35:23.830 --> 35:26.663
- But he would kill you.
- In his heart, he's a good man.

35:27.917 --> 35:31.125
And I know that one day
he'll bring about a world we all dream of.

35:32.255 --> 35:33.290
It must be hard.

35:35.216 --> 35:37.096
You may be a warlock,
but you need that treated.

35:37.218 --> 35:39.334
I'll help you. Please.

35:41.473 --> 35:42.553
Please.

35:59.157 --> 36:01.239
Gaius:
The bed has not been slept in.

36:01.409 --> 36:02.945
I fear he's in danger.

36:03.119 --> 36:04.279
Arthur: What do you mean?

36:04.454 --> 36:07.116
Gaius:
I think we need to send a search party.

36:08.333 --> 36:11.040
- What's happened?
- Merlin's gone missing.

36:12.504 --> 36:13.960
I knew I should have said something.

36:14.756 --> 36:17.919
Arthur, I feel terrible. This is my fault.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.045
I know where Merlin is.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.507
- Where?
- I shouldn't say.

36:23.682 --> 36:25.218
I promised him I wouldn't, but...

36:27.394 --> 36:29.555
He's gone to visit someone.

36:30.814 --> 36:33.351
- Who?
- He's not in danger.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.061
He's seeing a qirl.

36:36.736 --> 36:39.148
- Merlin®?
- Gaius, I'm sorry...

36:39.322 --> 36:40.903
But there is no reason to worry.

36:41.700 --> 36:44.157
- Except for the poor girl.
- I should have told you...

36:44.327 --> 36:46.943
But I don't think
he wanted anyone to know.

36:48.415 --> 36:50.371
- Thank you, milady.
- Good.

36:50.834 --> 36:54.452
Then we can get on with the signing.
Gaius, you can help me get dressed.

37:16.526 --> 37:19.438
- You've done well.
- Really?

37:20.113 --> 37:22.229
I don't think I've done
many good things in my life.

37:22.407 --> 37:24.568
Well, you've done something good now.
See?

37:25.827 --> 37:27.158
I'm better.

37:27.328 --> 37:30.536
- You have a gift.
- Must be from my mother.

37:31.458 --> 37:32.573
So that bit was true?

37:33.793 --> 37:36.956
It was all true, except about my sister.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.207
She isn't sick?

37:40.592 --> 37:41.832
I don't have a sister.

37:47.515 --> 37:52.009
- And your mother, she wasn't a druid?
- No, but she was like you.

37:52.187 --> 37:56.521
She had magic, and uther killed her for it.

37:57.776 --> 37:59.266
I'm sorry.

38:02.614 --> 38:03.945
Feels good. Come on.

38:09.162 --> 38:11.528
What a momentous day this is for Camelot.

38:11.706 --> 38:13.116
Indeed, my lord.

38:13.291 --> 38:15.998
It marks the beginning of a new era.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.774
What's wrong?

39:28.992 --> 39:30.732
This should be locked.

39:40.503 --> 39:41.959
Sarrum: Hmm.

40:26.799 --> 40:27.834
I eon!

40:59.540 --> 41:01.121
We did it.

41:11.386 --> 41:12.876
Did I save Arthur?

41:17.141 --> 41:18.597
Yes

41:18.851 --> 41:21.058
did I do something good?

41:23.106 --> 41:24.971
Finally, eh?

41:46.713 --> 41:48.419
You did.

41:58.641 --> 42:00.757
Arthur:
I still can't believe how lucky I was.

42:00.935 --> 42:05.429
I owe that boy my life
and I don't know who he was

42:05.606 --> 42:06.721
or where he's from.

42:06.899 --> 42:09.515
We need to make sure
we give him a decent burial.

42:09.694 --> 42:10.979
I'll do that.

42:12.196 --> 42:13.777
If you'll allow me the time.

42:15.450 --> 42:18.487
Oh, so you can go and
visit that girl again?

42:20.747 --> 42:22.078
What?

42:22.665 --> 42:23.996
Girl.

42:26.169 --> 42:28.000
Don't have one.

42:28.171 --> 42:30.583
That's not what Guinevere tells me.

42:36.846 --> 42:40.304
So why don't you tell us all about her?

42:47.899 --> 42:48.934
Right.

42:53.196 --> 42:55.187
And why you're walking with a limp.

43:10.421 --> 43:12.958
His life had hardly begun.

43:20.181 --> 43:22.888
- It can't go on, Gaius.
- Gwen.

43:23.059 --> 43:25.141
We have to do something about her.

43:25.311 --> 43:28.895
Yes, but the question is, what?

43:45.790 --> 43:47.200
If I lose her, I lose everything.

43:47.416 --> 43:49.136
We'll find a way to bring her back, Arthur.

43:59.679 --> 44:01.635
- I won't leave a knight behind.
- I saw morgana.

44:01.848 --> 44:03.888
Mordred's given us a chance.
We can't throw it away.
