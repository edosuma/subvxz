WEBVTT

00:03.742 --> 00:06.528
Another round,
doubles, straight up.

00:06.615 --> 00:08.921
Table six is still
waiting on their dessert.Oh...

00:09.009 --> 00:10.271
Can you help me out with that?

00:10.358 --> 00:12.012
I got a table
full of firemen

00:12.099 --> 00:14.275
drinking bourbon like
it's coming out of a hose.

00:14.362 --> 00:15.754
Firemen?

00:15.841 --> 00:17.887
Yeah, they saved
some rich clown's house

00:17.974 --> 00:19.019
and he gave 'em
a gift certificate.
Oh, yeah.

00:19.106 --> 00:21.021
I was the rich clown.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.196
By the way...

00:22.283 --> 00:24.067
tax and tip
not included.

00:24.154 --> 00:26.765
They should've
let you burn.

00:26.852 --> 00:29.899
[men laughing]

00:29.986 --> 00:31.901
Here we go.
Ooh.
Ooh.

00:31.988 --> 00:34.599
Four double bourbons.Thank goodness.
[laughs]

00:34.686 --> 00:36.688
Thank you for bringing
the medicine

00:36.775 --> 00:37.907
that alleviates my pain.

00:37.994 --> 00:40.040
Aw, are you in pain?

00:40.127 --> 00:41.563
Yes.

00:43.521 --> 00:43.956
No.

00:46.655 --> 00:48.570
You guys have fun.

00:48.657 --> 00:50.050
Hey, wait, don't go.

00:50.137 --> 00:51.964
I'm sorry.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.053
I got a lot of people
hurting in here.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.534
Yeah, but you and I
have something special.

00:56.621 --> 00:58.145
Really?
Mm-hmm.

00:58.232 --> 00:59.537
And what's that?

00:59.624 --> 01:01.539
Give me your hand.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.325
Feel it?

01:05.413 --> 01:06.718
No.

01:06.805 --> 01:09.591
Wait for it.

01:09.678 --> 01:10.070
How 'bout now?

01:12.507 --> 01:14.204
No.

01:16.076 --> 01:17.903
Come on.
My friends are watching.

01:17.990 --> 01:20.080
Feel it? [mouths]

01:22.256 --> 01:24.258
WOMAN:
Whoa!
Whoa!

01:24.345 --> 01:25.215
Don't worry,
I'll save you!

01:25.302 --> 01:27.174
What are you doing?

01:27.261 --> 01:29.437
My job.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.355
Come on, stop.

01:34.442 --> 01:35.007
Oh, hey.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.226
Hello.

01:36.313 --> 01:39.838
I'm not stealing
lobster.

01:39.925 --> 01:41.927
Okay, you can put me down now.

01:42.014 --> 01:43.233
I think I'm safe.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.279
No, you're not.

01:46.671 --> 01:48.195
Hang on.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.066
I don't even
know your name.

01:50.153 --> 01:52.024
It's David.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.678
All right, then.

01:57.204 --> 01:58.205
And I'm not stealing butter,
either.

02:16.092 --> 02:17.137
Easy...
Here we go.

02:17.224 --> 02:18.399
Watch your step.

02:18.486 --> 02:21.837
I'm the one
helping you.

02:21.924 --> 02:23.665
I was talking
to myself.

02:23.752 --> 02:25.667
Ooh!

02:25.754 --> 02:27.712
Okay.

02:27.799 --> 02:29.149
I'm gonna leave now.

02:29.236 --> 02:30.237
Do you remember
where your car is?

02:30.324 --> 02:32.587
At the restaurant!

02:34.110 --> 02:35.198
Do you remember
which restaurant?

02:35.285 --> 02:36.852
I do not.

02:38.941 --> 02:41.291
I'll, uh...
write it down for you.

02:43.119 --> 02:45.295
I know what's
happening.

02:45.382 --> 02:47.123
You drove me home

02:47.210 --> 02:48.733
so you could take
advantage of me.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.302
I already did.

02:52.389 --> 02:53.608
Twice.

02:54.783 --> 02:55.175
You don't remember?

02:59.570 --> 03:00.310
I'm gonna go.

03:00.397 --> 03:02.356
You can't leave.

03:02.443 --> 03:03.618
We have something special.

03:03.705 --> 03:05.837
You feel it?

03:05.924 --> 03:08.231
You already ran that line on me.

03:08.318 --> 03:11.191
I did? How'd it go?

03:12.975 --> 03:15.412
Actually, quite well.

03:15.499 --> 03:19.155
Just... please,
stay for a little while.

03:19.242 --> 03:21.157
[quietly]:
Come on.

03:22.202 --> 03:22.376
[mouths]

03:26.510 --> 03:27.598
Five minutes.

03:27.685 --> 03:28.991
Great.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.340
I'll pour us
a couple of drinks.

03:30.427 --> 03:31.341
Oh, I'm fine.

03:31.428 --> 03:32.342
You go ahead.

03:32.429 --> 03:34.431
You sure?

03:34.518 --> 03:37.391
I'm much more charming
if you're loaded.

03:37.478 --> 03:40.045
I was making out with you
by the Dumpsters.

03:40.132 --> 03:42.134
You're charming enough.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.353
Okay.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.530
Interesting.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.445
Lot of books, no TV.

03:48.532 --> 03:50.230
Waitress by day,
detective by night!

03:54.059 --> 03:56.279
Socrates, Nietzsche...

03:56.366 --> 03:59.151
Kierkegaard.

03:59.239 --> 04:03.112
50 Years of Playboy.

04:03.199 --> 04:04.331
Can't really masturbate
to Socrates.

04:10.206 --> 04:11.947
Do the other firemen
make fun of you?

04:12.034 --> 04:13.818
They call me the Professor.

04:13.905 --> 04:14.732
Mm...

04:14.819 --> 04:15.864
Could be worse.

04:15.951 --> 04:18.127
You could be Ginger or Mary Ann.

04:19.519 --> 04:20.476
What?

04:22.523 --> 04:24.002
Gilligan's Island.

04:24.089 --> 04:26.135
I have a TV.

04:29.138 --> 04:31.096
Hang on.

04:31.183 --> 04:34.491
You have a Doctorate of
Philosophy from Stanford?

04:34.578 --> 04:36.188
I do.

04:36.276 --> 04:41.063
Okay, you get two more minutes.

04:41.150 --> 04:44.806
Explain how you go
from that to fireman.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.895
I had no choice.

04:46.982 --> 04:48.897
After the mortgage meltdown,

04:48.984 --> 04:51.987
the philosophy business
went right to hell.

04:56.339 --> 04:57.819
Can I kiss you?

04:59.647 --> 05:01.039
Look, I think
I gave you

05:01.126 --> 05:03.694
the wrong impression
in the parking lot.

05:03.781 --> 05:06.523
I'm really not that
kind of girl, so...

05:06.610 --> 05:07.307
Good night.

05:07.394 --> 05:10.919
Good night.

05:11.006 --> 05:12.834
Oh, who am I kidding?
I am so that girl.

05:29.981 --> 05:30.417
Slut.

05:34.508 --> 05:36.640
Oh.

05:36.727 --> 05:39.600
Good evening, Mother.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.863
It's really late.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.473
Where you been?

05:43.560 --> 05:44.909
Oh...

05:44.996 --> 05:46.520
We got a tip
the health department

05:46.607 --> 05:49.610
is gonna inspect the
restaurant tomorrow.

05:49.697 --> 05:51.960
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

05:52.047 --> 05:54.223
And one of the freezers
is leaking coolant

05:54.310 --> 05:56.573
and it goes all over
where the fish is, so...

05:56.660 --> 05:58.923
we all had to stay
and clean out the walk-in.

05:59.010 --> 06:00.403
Took forever.

06:02.013 --> 06:03.624
Almost as long as this lie.

06:05.321 --> 06:07.149
I'm telling the truth.

06:07.236 --> 06:08.672
Why don't you believe me?

06:08.759 --> 06:10.805
Because your panties
are in your purse.

06:13.808 --> 06:14.765
Oh, that.

06:14.852 --> 06:16.376
Well, if you must know,

06:16.463 --> 06:18.813
I had a little accident.

06:20.380 --> 06:21.903
Really?

06:21.990 --> 06:23.426
You would rather admit
to wetting yourself

06:23.513 --> 06:25.428
than telling me
you were with somebody?

06:26.690 --> 06:28.779
[sighs]

06:28.866 --> 06:29.998
Okay.

06:30.085 --> 06:32.217
There was a guy.

06:32.304 --> 06:33.175
An incredible guy.

06:33.262 --> 06:36.091
Okay, now we're talking.

06:36.178 --> 06:37.962
Why were you
so embarrassed?

06:38.049 --> 06:40.138
'Cause I met
him at 9:00

06:40.225 --> 06:42.271
and had my feet behind
my ears at midnight.

06:45.448 --> 06:47.581
And...?

06:50.061 --> 06:52.107
That's it.
That's embarrassing.

06:52.194 --> 06:54.152
Wow. You and I
are so different.

06:55.371 --> 06:56.328
Tell me about him.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.766
Ooh...

06:58.853 --> 06:59.897
where do I start?

06:59.984 --> 07:01.072
He's a fireman.

07:01.159 --> 07:03.335
Like it.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.076
He has a doctorate
in philosophy.

07:05.163 --> 07:07.470
Boring.

07:07.557 --> 07:08.993
[exhales]

07:09.080 --> 07:10.473
And when his pants
came down, oh, Mom,

07:10.560 --> 07:13.389
you could play horseshoes
on that thing.

07:17.045 --> 07:19.047
Back to like.

07:20.527 --> 07:23.355
So when are you
seeing him again?

07:23.443 --> 07:25.314
I'm not.

07:25.401 --> 07:26.794
Why?

07:26.881 --> 07:28.578
Did you steal something
from his apartment?

07:28.665 --> 07:30.319
No.

07:30.406 --> 07:31.494
Who does that?

07:31.581 --> 07:32.626
No one.

07:35.193 --> 07:36.586
Continue.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.936
It's just...

07:39.023 --> 07:41.243
[sighs]

07:41.330 --> 07:41.809
...he drinks an awful lot.

07:41.896 --> 07:43.985
So?

07:44.072 --> 07:45.203
What do you mean "so?"

07:45.290 --> 07:47.031
I'm closing in on a year sober.

07:47.118 --> 07:48.206
I can't be around
that kind of stuff.

07:48.293 --> 07:49.643
Oh, come on.

07:49.730 --> 07:51.122
What's the point of
building a better life

07:51.209 --> 07:52.515
if you can't let a man
treat you like a whore

07:52.602 --> 07:55.562
every once
in a while?

07:55.649 --> 07:59.609
It was a one-night stand,
end of story.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.481
Wait, how 'bout this?

08:01.568 --> 08:03.657
You double up
on your meetings

08:03.744 --> 08:05.093
and bang him till
his liver explodes.

08:05.180 --> 08:06.094
Win-win.

08:06.181 --> 08:08.879
That's great advice.

08:08.966 --> 08:11.708
You really should
be a life coach.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.971
You know,
you're being sarcastic,

08:14.058 --> 08:15.495
but my probation officer
says the same thing.

08:19.977 --> 08:21.979
[panting]

08:30.335 --> 08:33.469
The French call the orgasm
la petite mort.

08:33.556 --> 08:35.471
Means "the
little death."

08:35.558 --> 08:39.519
Well, then you're
a serial killer.

08:44.698 --> 08:47.352
This is nice.

08:47.439 --> 08:48.745
You know what
would be nicer?

08:48.832 --> 08:51.531
I told you I'm not
gonna do that.

08:53.358 --> 08:55.143
I'm talking about
a little weed.

08:55.230 --> 08:57.406
Oh.

08:57.493 --> 08:59.190
I'm not gonna
do that either.

08:59.277 --> 09:00.409
You mind if I...

09:00.496 --> 09:01.628
No. No, no, no,
of course not.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.936
So, you don't drink,

09:06.023 --> 09:09.070
you don't
get high...

09:09.157 --> 09:10.985
Are you, like, a
Mormon or something?

09:11.072 --> 09:12.377
[scoffs]

09:12.464 --> 09:14.205
There was a time
I would've thought

09:14.292 --> 09:16.164
youwere Mormon for
just drinking and smoking.

09:16.251 --> 09:18.209
Seriously?

09:18.296 --> 09:19.994
Don't take this
the wrong way,

09:20.081 --> 09:22.387
but bourbon and weed
is for babies.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.564
Oh, my heart is
filling with love.

09:24.651 --> 09:27.567
Yeah, well...

09:27.654 --> 09:28.568
I'm doing the sober
thing for now.

09:28.655 --> 09:31.266
Really?

09:31.353 --> 09:33.007
Good for you.

09:35.052 --> 09:36.271
I admire that.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.186
Facing life on
life's terms

09:38.273 --> 09:39.622
is a warrior's
path.

09:39.709 --> 09:42.669
Well, I don't think
I'm a warrior.

09:42.756 --> 09:45.106
No, that's exactly
what you are.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.716
You're a
spiritual warrior.

09:46.803 --> 09:49.023
Every Eastern philosophy
emphasizes...

09:49.110 --> 09:51.373
[inhaling]

09:51.460 --> 09:53.505
...physical
sobriety

09:53.593 --> 09:54.985
to allow the
consciousness,

09:55.072 --> 09:57.248
the ever present "I,"

09:57.335 --> 09:58.641
the Godhead,
to merge with...

09:58.728 --> 10:00.425
[inhales]

10:00.512 --> 10:02.514
...the white-hot moment
of the eternal now.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.647
[inhales]

10:04.734 --> 10:06.736
You don't say.

10:06.823 --> 10:09.696
Animals get it.

10:09.783 --> 10:10.871
They live
in the now.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.089
A hummingbird

10:12.176 --> 10:13.569
doesn't regret
yesterday

10:13.656 --> 10:15.745
or worry about
tomorrow

10:15.832 --> 10:17.094
'cause that doesn't
actually exist,

10:17.181 --> 10:17.834
except in
our minds.

10:17.921 --> 10:20.620
[inhales]

10:20.707 --> 10:23.231
You know, a small
TV in here

10:23.318 --> 10:25.276
wouldn't be the worst
idea in the world.

10:30.760 --> 10:32.675
I like you.

10:34.285 --> 10:35.591
I think you like
everything right now.

10:35.678 --> 10:38.028
No...

10:38.115 --> 10:40.335
This isn't the
weed talking.

10:40.422 --> 10:41.771
I really like you.

10:41.858 --> 10:43.599
I think you're
an amazing woman.

10:43.686 --> 10:46.602
Thanks.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.648
I really
like you, too.

10:54.958 --> 10:56.090
Can I ask you
something?

10:56.177 --> 10:57.526
Sure.

10:57.613 --> 11:00.050
Are sober people
allowed to do coke?

11:02.574 --> 11:05.186
No.

11:05.273 --> 11:06.709
You're so brave.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.017
Be right back.

11:13.150 --> 11:14.935
Hey, old buddy.

11:15.022 --> 11:15.718
Remember me?

11:22.943 --> 11:23.987
Hi, I'm Bonnie.
I'm an alcoholic.

11:24.074 --> 11:25.902
OTHERS:
Hi, Bonnie.

11:25.989 --> 11:28.209
And as a newly
certified life coach,

11:28.296 --> 11:31.516
I'm also the answer
to all your problems.

11:31.603 --> 11:32.953
Take one, and
pass it around.

11:33.040 --> 11:34.476
Oh, Mom, no.

11:34.563 --> 11:37.914
I don't do "no."
I'm in the "yes" game.

11:38.001 --> 11:39.916
It's time for me
to pay forward everything

11:40.003 --> 11:42.310
I've learned on my
remarkable journey
of sobriety.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.747
You've been sober
for three months.

11:44.834 --> 11:46.749
Yeah. I've been winning
for three months.

11:46.836 --> 11:50.144
And I want all of you
to win, too.

11:50.231 --> 11:52.407
In love, at work,
and with family.

11:52.494 --> 11:53.800
150 bucks an hour?

11:53.887 --> 11:55.018
You want me off
your couch or not?

11:55.105 --> 11:57.499
Veryreasonable.

11:57.586 --> 11:59.631
After the meeting, I'll be over
by the cookies

11:59.719 --> 12:00.763
to answer your questions.

12:00.850 --> 12:02.504
Oh, where did you get certified?

12:02.591 --> 12:04.636
Not that question.

12:06.334 --> 12:08.510
Thanks for letting me share.
Christy?

12:08.597 --> 12:11.513
Oh, you know, I'm good.

12:11.600 --> 12:15.430
Nothing going on with me.
I'm gonna pass.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.475
What about the
drunk fireman?

12:19.129 --> 12:21.479
I'm passing, Mom. Mary?

12:21.566 --> 12:23.525
Oh, thank you.

12:23.612 --> 12:24.787
My name is Mary...

12:24.874 --> 12:26.397
Yeah, yeah,
we know your name.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.488
You-you sure you don't
want to tell everybody

12:30.575 --> 12:32.621
you spent last
night staring down

12:32.708 --> 12:34.144
the business end
of a bong?

12:34.231 --> 12:34.928
Nope.

12:35.015 --> 12:36.973
You're up, Mary.

12:37.060 --> 12:40.194
Okay. Well,
my son's back in jail...

12:40.281 --> 12:42.326
Where he belongs, Mary.

12:42.413 --> 12:46.156
Christy, you
need to be honest
with this group.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.332
You were the one
who encouraged me to see him.

12:48.419 --> 12:49.943
I didn't encourage you
to start getting high.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.467
I didn't get high!
Go ahead, Mary.

12:52.554 --> 12:54.164
He's in jail and...?

12:54.251 --> 12:56.993
And the Aryan Nation guys
really don't like him.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.995
Tell him to put a
swastika on his head.
He'll be fine.

13:00.997 --> 13:02.433
And I just wanted
you to get laid.

13:02.520 --> 13:04.044
I didn't want you
to ruin your life.

13:04.131 --> 13:05.088
Yeah, 'cause that's your job!

13:09.049 --> 13:11.094
[door shuts]

13:11.181 --> 13:13.009
Can I finish now?

13:13.096 --> 13:14.706
Seriously?

13:14.794 --> 13:15.969
I just had a big fight
with my daughter.

13:16.056 --> 13:17.405
You're gonna hog
the meeting?

13:23.019 --> 13:26.240
[tires squeal, loud crash]

13:29.939 --> 13:32.681
What the hell
was that?!

13:32.768 --> 13:33.900
I don't know!

13:36.990 --> 13:37.947
CHRISTY:
Oh, my God!

13:38.034 --> 13:41.821
Top o' the morning!

13:43.605 --> 13:45.694
David, what are
you doing?!

13:45.781 --> 13:49.089
That's David?
Oh, I totally get it.

13:49.176 --> 13:54.703
And who's this enchantress
in flaid plannel?

13:54.790 --> 13:56.879
Plaid flannel?

13:56.966 --> 13:59.403
This is my mom,
Bonnie.

13:59.490 --> 14:02.189
You can't just say Bonnie?

14:02.276 --> 14:04.452
Well, Bonnie, they certainly
left the hose on a long time

14:04.539 --> 14:05.409
when they poured you.

14:05.496 --> 14:08.848
Totally, totally get it.

14:08.935 --> 14:11.763
What the hell are you doing
with a fire truck?

14:11.851 --> 14:14.636
I'm making a beer run.
What does it look like?

14:14.723 --> 14:17.117
Come inside.

14:19.162 --> 14:22.035
Everybody go back to bed!

14:22.122 --> 14:23.558
There's no a fire.

14:23.645 --> 14:25.212
It's just my daughter's
boyfriend!

14:25.299 --> 14:25.995
He's a drunk!

14:30.957 --> 14:33.785
Sit down. I'll make
you some coffee.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.179
Thank you.

14:36.266 --> 14:38.529
I can't believe you were driving
that fire truck

14:38.616 --> 14:40.096
drunk off your ass.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.445
What were you thinking?!

14:41.532 --> 14:43.273
You're smarter than that.

14:43.360 --> 14:45.493
BONNIE:
Christy?

14:45.580 --> 14:47.277
Elvis has left the building.

14:48.975 --> 14:50.454
Oh, boy.

14:50.541 --> 14:53.196
Hey, do you think he needs
a life coach?

14:53.283 --> 14:54.589
What?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.158
I'll just give him a flier.

14:59.942 --> 15:01.248
What's going on?

15:01.335 --> 15:02.902
Nothing. Go to bed.Who's that?

15:02.989 --> 15:05.513
He's... just a friend...

15:05.600 --> 15:07.254
who's taking a nap.

15:07.341 --> 15:10.518
You sure? He looks drunk.

15:12.694 --> 15:15.697
Violet, please take
your brother back to bed.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.655
Come on, Roscoe.

15:17.742 --> 15:20.049
Remember when Mom was drunk
and we drew mustaches on her?

15:22.573 --> 15:24.314
All right, what's the plan?

15:24.401 --> 15:28.579
I don't know. I guess we just
let him sleep it off.

15:28.666 --> 15:31.887
Yeah. All right,
as long as he doesn't snore.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.106
Mom, you're sleeping with me.

15:33.193 --> 15:34.498
I knew that.

15:36.283 --> 15:39.199
Okay, help me out here.

15:39.286 --> 15:40.200
Ah, look.

15:40.287 --> 15:43.681
His emergency weed.

15:43.768 --> 15:45.161
Keeps it in his shoe?

15:45.248 --> 15:46.597
What an amateur.

15:46.684 --> 15:49.035
I can't believe
I used to put my kids

15:49.122 --> 15:50.906
through all
this craziness.

15:50.993 --> 15:53.517
Well, at least
you never stole a fire truck.

15:53.604 --> 15:56.651
No. Wait...

15:56.738 --> 15:58.000
No.

15:58.087 --> 16:02.439
You know what's
really crazy?

16:02.526 --> 16:04.093
The more I'm with him,

16:04.180 --> 16:07.662
the more I want to throw
my sobriety out the window

16:07.749 --> 16:10.404
and get the party going again.

16:10.491 --> 16:13.233
Wow.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.062
I could use a meeting.
Could you use a meeting?

16:16.149 --> 16:17.411
You think?

16:17.498 --> 16:19.674
Why don't you start?

16:19.761 --> 16:22.024
Hi, I'm Christy.

16:22.111 --> 16:23.721
I'm an alcoholic.

16:23.808 --> 16:24.853
Hi, Christy.

16:24.940 --> 16:26.246
Hi, Christy.

16:29.205 --> 16:32.339
All right,
here's the thing.

16:32.426 --> 16:36.212
I'm dating this sweet, smart,

16:36.299 --> 16:38.127
smokinghot guy

16:38.214 --> 16:41.043
who's just a train wreck.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.959
And I know that
it's not good for me,

16:44.046 --> 16:48.268
but I don't want to go back
to being alone.

16:50.139 --> 16:52.576
That's all I got.

16:52.663 --> 16:54.230
Thanks, Christy.

16:54.317 --> 16:55.710
Hi, I'm Bonnie.
I'm an alcoholic.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.494
Hi, Bonnie.

16:57.581 --> 17:00.193
I just want to say how
proud I am of my daughter.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.151
She is the strongest
person I know.

17:02.238 --> 17:05.807
If I had a guy like this,
I'd be robbing banks

17:05.894 --> 17:07.461
and shooting heroin
into my eyeballs

17:07.548 --> 17:08.156
to keep our love alive.

17:12.640 --> 17:15.034
This was a good idea, Mom.

17:15.121 --> 17:15.904
Thanks.

17:15.991 --> 17:17.079
I'm a life coach...

17:17.165 --> 17:19.907
it's what I do.

17:21.170 --> 17:23.041
Let's go to bed.
Yeah.

17:25.827 --> 17:27.133
Oh...

17:27.220 --> 17:28.873
What about the fire truck?

17:28.960 --> 17:31.267
Ooh. He could lose his job.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.227
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

17:36.185 --> 17:38.100
Oh, yeah.

17:47.370 --> 17:49.155
[ringtones play]

17:51.548 --> 17:52.680
Yeah?

17:52.767 --> 17:54.203
Why are you stopping?

17:54.290 --> 17:55.726
It's a red light.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.946
You're in a fire truck!

17:58.033 --> 18:00.253
Oh, yeah. Hang on.

18:03.256 --> 18:06.172
[siren wails]

18:06.259 --> 18:07.173
Whoo!

18:07.260 --> 18:10.176
Whoo!
Yeah!

18:10.263 --> 18:11.220
Whoo!

18:16.007 --> 18:18.401
Get in the car
with your sister.

18:18.488 --> 18:19.228
I'll be right there.Okay.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.056
Bye, sweetie.

18:21.143 --> 18:23.972
Bye, Mom.

18:24.059 --> 18:24.799
Thanks for taking everybody
to school.

18:24.886 --> 18:25.887
No problem.

18:25.974 --> 18:28.846
Did you talk to David yet?

18:28.933 --> 18:30.892
I'm waiting for him
to get out of the shower.

18:30.979 --> 18:34.722
You think he's using my loofah?

18:34.809 --> 18:36.463
Mom.

18:36.550 --> 18:37.638
I'm sorry.

18:37.725 --> 18:40.031
You're doing the right thing.

18:40.119 --> 18:41.163
I know.

18:41.250 --> 18:43.122
Don't worry.

18:43.209 --> 18:47.126
There'll be other hot, smart,
freshly exfoliated firemen.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.215
No, there won't.

18:49.302 --> 18:51.042
Yeah, probably not.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.827
See ya later.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.657
Morning.

18:58.049 --> 18:59.399
Keep walking, Mom.

19:02.228 --> 19:05.100
Hey, uh, got some
coffee here for you.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.972
Thanks for bringing
the truck back.

19:08.059 --> 19:09.496
Ah, it was fun.

19:09.583 --> 19:12.194
Kind of a bitch
to parallel park, though.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.983
Christy, I might have a problem.

19:19.070 --> 19:19.854
Oh, you do.

19:21.725 --> 19:23.292
I mean, you do?

19:23.379 --> 19:26.774
Yeah. I am...

19:26.861 --> 19:28.123
I'm crazy about you

19:28.210 --> 19:30.995
and I cannot get you
out of my mind.

19:33.128 --> 19:35.870
Oh. Wow.

19:35.957 --> 19:38.699
That's it?

19:38.786 --> 19:40.048
No other problems?

19:40.135 --> 19:43.051
Just you.

19:43.138 --> 19:44.966
And I can't find
my emergency weed.

19:45.053 --> 19:47.838
Uh-huh.

19:47.925 --> 19:50.928
Feel free to say
I'm your problem, too.

19:51.015 --> 19:54.976
Oh, believe me,
you're a huge problem,

19:55.063 --> 19:56.630
it's just, uh...

19:59.981 --> 20:03.898
I'm sorry, I don't think
I can do this anymore.

20:03.985 --> 20:07.684
What? Wh... why not?

20:07.771 --> 20:09.686
'Cause you're still doing
the party thing,

20:09.773 --> 20:13.386
and that's cool,
but I can't handle it.

20:13.473 --> 20:16.258
I could lose everything.

20:19.783 --> 20:22.046
What if I cleaned up my act?

20:23.526 --> 20:25.049
Are you willing to do that?

20:25.136 --> 20:28.749
I'm willing
to lie about it.

20:28.836 --> 20:32.796
Yeah, that's
not gonna work.

20:34.058 --> 20:36.104
I get it.

20:36.191 --> 20:37.758
I'm sorry.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.063
Me, too.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.025
You're still
my hummingbird warrior.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.947
If you ever change your mind,
you've got my number.

20:53.034 --> 20:57.081
Yeah. 911.
