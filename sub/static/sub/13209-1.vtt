00:43.875 --> 00:47.957
Sometimes, Doctor Lecter and I would
talk when things got quiet enough

00:48.041 --> 00:51.624
about the science courses
I was takin' and...

00:51.708 --> 00:56.415
Mail order courses in psychology?
- No, sir.

00:56.500 --> 01:00.874
I don't consider psychology a science.
And neither did Doctor Lecter.

01:05.000 --> 01:09.207
Now, Barney,
while you were working at the asylum,

01:09.375 --> 01:13.707
you observed Clarice Starling and
Hannibal Lecter...

01:13.791 --> 01:17.374
interacting.
- Eh, interacting?

01:17.458 --> 01:20.999
Talking to one another.
- Yes... yes,

01:21.750 --> 01:25.707
it seemed to me that they...
- I can see you're eager to justify

01:25.791 --> 01:29.874
your consulting fee, but why don't
we start with what you saw not what

01:29.958 --> 01:33.999
you thought about what you saw.
- Oh, Cordell, don't be like that.

01:34.083 --> 01:38.249
Barney can give us his opinion.
Barney, give us your opinion

01:38.833 --> 01:42.999
of what you saw.
What was it between them?

01:43.916 --> 01:48.707
Well, most of the time, Doctor Lecter
didn't respond at all to visitors.

01:48.791 --> 01:52.957
He'd just, for instance, open his eyes
long enough to insult some academic

01:53.291 --> 01:56.332
who was there to look over him.

01:56.416 --> 02:01.332
With Starling, he answered her
questions. She interested him.

02:01.458 --> 02:06.207
Uh... she intrigued him. He thought
she was charming and amusing.

02:06.291 --> 02:09.957
Mm-hm. So Clarice Starling and
Hannibal Lecter

02:10.041 --> 02:13.624
became friendly.
- Well,

02:14.208 --> 02:18.832
in a kind of formal structure, yes.
- And he was fond of her.

02:23.000 --> 02:25.040
Yes.

02:25.125 --> 02:28.874
Thank you, Barney.
Thank you very much for your candor.

02:28.958 --> 02:32.915
And keep all those
wonderful items from your

02:33.000 --> 02:36.790
personal Lecter treasure trove coming.
I've enjoyed them immensely.

02:36.875 --> 02:40.665
Mr. Verger.
- Oh, I almost forgot.

02:40.750 --> 02:44.207
I might be able to get a cookie down.
What do you think, Cordell?

02:44.291 --> 02:47.790
I think it would kill you.

02:55.291 --> 02:58.415
How much?
- Two hundred and fifty. Thousand.

02:59.750 --> 03:04.874
Cordell, cut a check
for 250,000 dollars.

04:59.750 --> 05:03.249
How can she sleep at a time like this?

05:03.333 --> 05:07.790
She's on a jump-out squad all night.
She's saving her strength.

05:40.791 --> 05:45.957
Pay attention. Here's the layout.
- I'm Officer Bolton, D.C. Police.

05:47.083 --> 05:50.665
Yes, I can see that from your badge.
- I'm in charge here.

05:50.750 --> 05:54.624
Officer Bolton, I'm Special Agent
Starling, and just so we don't get

05:54.708 --> 05:58.790
off on the wrong foot, let me explain
why we're all here. I'm here because

05:58.875 --> 06:02.790
I know Evelda Drumgo. I've arrested
her twice on RICO warrants.

06:02.875 --> 06:06.957
D.E.A. and A.T.F., are here for the
drugs and the weapons.

06:07.041 --> 06:11.124
You're here because our mayor wants
to appear tough on drugs especially

06:11.208 --> 06:15.124
after his own cocaine conviction,
and hopes he can accomplish

06:15.208 --> 06:18.790
that by having you join us here today.
- You got a smart mouth, lady.

06:18.875 --> 06:22.790
If you wouldn't mind, I'd appreciate
it if you'd let me continue, Officer.

06:22.875 --> 06:27.582
All right, take a look.
Fish market backs on the water.

06:27.666 --> 06:31.249
Across the street, ground floor
is the meth lab.

06:31.333 --> 06:35.415
Drumgo's H.I.V. Positive, she will
spit and bite if she's cornered,

06:35.500 --> 06:39.415
so you should watch it. And if you the
one who puts her in a patrol car you

06:39.500 --> 06:43.582
don't want to push her head down.
She'll likely have a needle in

06:43.666 --> 06:47.749
her hair. We want to take her inside
the building, not out in the street.

06:47.833 --> 06:51.707
We can get closest with the van.
If it looks good, we hit the front,

06:51.791 --> 06:55.874
D.E.A. hits the back, D.C.P.D. backin'
them up. She'll have her watchers out

06:55.958 --> 07:00.040
at least three blocks around.
They've tipped her before in time,

07:00.125 --> 07:04.415
so let's not make spectacles
of ourselves.

07:13.250 --> 07:17.415
Pretty busy today.
- I agree.

07:22.833 --> 07:26.999
Can I please get a cup of coffee?

07:37.958 --> 07:42.415
Did you see that?

07:42.500 --> 07:45.082
That's a roger.

08:03.916 --> 08:07.707
Goddamn it, it's her.
With three guys. They're all packin'.

08:07.791 --> 08:12.790
She's carryin' something. She's got a
baby. Hey, Brigham it's too crowded.

08:13.916 --> 08:17.749
There are too many people.
I say we call it off. What do you say?

08:17.833 --> 08:22.040
I agree. All units stand down.

08:22.125 --> 08:25.165
Whiskey team copies.
- Burke copy.

08:25.250 --> 08:29.165
This is Bolton. Stay on target.
- I said all units stand down. Now.

08:29.250 --> 08:33.164
It's too late. We're movin' in.
- Bolton, he said it's off. Stand down.

08:33.250 --> 08:37.249
She's carrying a baby. I repeat, she's
carrying a baby. All units stand down.

08:37.332 --> 08:41.499
Keep that gun down, Bolton.
Bolton! Son of a bitch!

08:41.582 --> 08:44.164
It's a go. F.B.I.!

09:25.916 --> 09:30.249
Hold it! Hold your fire!

09:31.208 --> 09:33.290
Don't!

09:35.875 --> 09:39.999
Evelda, get out of the car!

09:40.083 --> 09:43.290
Starling, is that you?

09:43.375 --> 09:48.290
Step away from the car!
Show me your hands.

09:48.375 --> 09:51.082
Evelda. Please.

09:52.708 --> 09:56.124
Show me your hands.
- How've you been?

09:56.208 --> 10:00.374
Don't do this.
- Do what?

10:31.208 --> 10:34.874
It's all right. It's okay.

10:36.083 --> 10:40.999
I know, I know, baby, I know.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay, baby.

10:41.125 --> 10:45.165
I know, it's okay. It's okay.

11:03.375 --> 11:07.207
Friends, family, co-workers gathered
here this morning at Arlington to

11:07.291 --> 11:11.290
bury B.A.T. F. Agent John Brigham, shot
and killed in the line of duty Friday.

11:11.375 --> 11:15.457
He was 40 years old. This ill-fated
drug raid that claimed his life and

11:15.541 --> 11:19.374
5 others is the latest in a seemingly
endless series of incidents,

11:19.458 --> 11:23.540
beginning with Waco, Texas, in which
the Justice Department and the F.B.I.

11:23.625 --> 11:27.624
Have been questioned about their use
of firepower rather than judgement.

11:27.708 --> 11:31.707
This time it was F.B.I. Special Agent
Clarice Starling heading up the

11:31.791 --> 11:35.457
calamitous strike force. She attained
some measure of celebrity 10 years

11:35.541 --> 11:39.624
ago, when she was given information by
Dr. Hannibal "The Cannibal" Lecter,

11:39.708 --> 11:43.790
which led to the rescue of
Catherine Martin.

11:43.875 --> 11:47.790
However, when she returns to work
later this week, she won't be so

11:47.875 --> 11:51.790
celebrated. Attorney Telford Higgins,
representing one of the families of

11:51.875 --> 11:55.082
those slain, says he will file...

11:55.166 --> 11:57.790
Cordell!

12:06.125 --> 12:08.624
Cordell.
- Yes, sir.

12:09.375 --> 12:13.082
Get me the Justice Department.

12:19.583 --> 12:23.540
Agent Starling, this is John Eldridge
from D.E.A. Assistant Director Noonan,

12:23.625 --> 12:28.374
of course, you know. Larkin Wayne from
our Office of Internal Affairs.

12:28.458 --> 12:32.540
Bob Sneed, A.T.F., Benny Holcombe,
Assistant to the Mayor.

12:32.625 --> 12:36.415
And Paul Krendler. You know Paul.
Paul's come over from Justice

12:36.500 --> 12:40.415
unofficially, as a favor to us.
In other words,

12:40.500 --> 12:44.749
he's here and he's not here.
- So I take it you've seen the coverage

12:44.833 --> 12:49.207
in the papers and on television?
- I have nothing to do with the news.

12:50.208 --> 12:54.332
The woman had a baby in her arms.
There are pictures.

12:54.583 --> 12:58.415
You could see the problem, I'd think.
- Not in her arms. In a carrier across

12:59.500 --> 13:02.749
her chest. In her arms was a MAC-10.
- Look, we're here to help you.

13:03.416 --> 13:07.790
It's gonna be a hell of a lot harder
to do with a combative attitude.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.915
Can I speak freely, Mr. Pearsall?

13:17.000 --> 13:21.082
Your agency called this office to get
me assigned to help you on this raid.

13:21.166 --> 13:25.165
I tried to do that. I clearly
expressed my judgement and was ignored,

13:25.250 --> 13:29.415
and now a good agent and a friend
is dead.

13:31.708 --> 13:35.457
You shot and killed 5 people out
there, Agent Starling. Is that how

13:35.541 --> 13:39.790
you define good judgement?
- This raid was an ugly mess.

13:39.875 --> 13:43.957
I ended up in a position where I had
a choice of dying or shooting a woman

13:44.041 --> 13:48.582
carrying a child. I chose.
I shot her.

13:49.875 --> 13:54.457
I killed a mother holding her child.

13:54.541 --> 13:58.624
I regret it. I resent myself for it.
- All right, gentlemen, I'm going to

13:58.708 --> 14:03.624
call a halt to this meeting and get
back to you individually by phone.

14:06.083 --> 14:08.332
Well that was a waste of time.

14:09.875 --> 14:13.749
You have a secret admirer, Starling.
He isn't much to look at,

14:13.833 --> 14:19.249
but he does have friends in high
places. Remember Mason Verger?

14:20.416 --> 14:24.415
Lecter's fourth victim. The rich one.

14:24.500 --> 14:27.832
The only one that survived.

14:27.916 --> 14:31.499
He says he has some new information on
Lecter. He'll only share it with you.

14:31.583 --> 14:35.790
Only me? You want it seize it.
- We'd rather not.

14:35.875 --> 14:40.249
I wasn't speaking to you, Krendler.
When I speak to you, I'll look at you.

14:41.791 --> 14:45.332
Why would we rather not?
- The last time he called was when we

14:45.416 --> 14:49.832
took Lecter off the 10 Most Wanted
List. He was upset about that.

14:49.916 --> 14:53.999
We said, "Hey, that's life."
He said, "Hey, this is a Senate

14:54.083 --> 14:57.915
Oversight Committee to make your life
miserable." His family's political

14:58.000 --> 15:02.082
contributions may not be enough to buy
a senator, but they are enough to

15:02.166 --> 15:06.249
rent them from time to time. There's no
reason to go through that again if he

15:06.333 --> 15:09.874
really does have something new.

15:09.958 --> 15:14.540
It's a good deal for you, Starling.
You can't pretend it isn't. You get

15:14.625 --> 15:18.707
to go back on a celebrated case. I'll
take care of the media for your Drumgo

15:18.791 --> 15:22.999
killing. Everyone’s gonna be happy.
- I'm not happy.

15:23.083 --> 15:27.374
Well, maybe you're incapable
of being happy.

15:28.541 --> 15:32.749
Mr. Krendler, when you're out on
the street, you know you might take

15:32.875 --> 15:36.957
a bullet in the line of duty. You
accept it or you get out. You live

15:37.041 --> 15:41.124
with it. What you don't expect, or
accept, is taking one in the back in

15:41.208 --> 15:45.290
your boss's office for doing your job
exactly as they've taught you.

15:45.375 --> 15:49.040
That makes you unhappy.

15:49.125 --> 15:53.415
Of course you're right, Starling.
But it doesn't really change anything.

15:53.500 --> 15:57.374
It changes everything.
It changes me.

16:47.875 --> 16:51.915
Miss Starling. I'm Cordell Doemling,
Mr. Verger's private physician.

16:52.000 --> 16:56.124
How do you do?
- Please park down at the end.

17:01.750 --> 17:06.332
One's eyes adjust to the darkness.

17:19.833 --> 17:24.040
Mr. Verger, Agent Starling is here.
- Good morning, Mr. Verger.

17:25.333 --> 17:30.082
Was that a Mustang I heard out there?
- Yes, it was.

17:30.166 --> 17:33.040
Five-liter?
- Yes.

17:33.125 --> 17:37.290
Fast.
Cordell, I think you can leave us now.

17:38.375 --> 17:42.540
I... thought I might stay.
Perhaps I could be useful.

17:43.208 --> 17:47.582
You could be useful
seeing about my lunch.

17:51.500 --> 17:55.582
I'd like to attach this microphone
To your clothing or your pillow.

17:55.666 --> 17:59.040
Oh, by all means.

18:02.375 --> 18:06.040
Oh, here, this should make it easier.

18:11.916 --> 18:16.207
You know, I thank God
for what happened.

18:16.625 --> 18:20.124
It was my salvation.

18:20.208 --> 18:24.457
Have you accepted Jesus, Agent
Starling? Do you have faith?

18:24.750 --> 18:28.332
I was raised Lutheran.
- That's not what I asked.

18:28.416 --> 18:32.999
This is Special Agent Starling,
5-1-4-3-6-9-0, deposing Mason Verger

18:33.250 --> 18:37.915
on March 20, sworn and attested.
Mr. Verger...

18:38.000 --> 18:42.207
We can get to that later. I just...
- No, we can get it to now.

18:42.291 --> 18:46.374
You see it all comes to bear.
It was a Christian camp

18:46.458 --> 18:51.207
my father founded for poor,
unfortunate, cast-off

18:52.000 --> 18:53.082
little boys and girls who would do
anything for a candy bar.

18:56.250 --> 19:00.165
Mr. Verger, I don't need to know
about the sex offenses. I just...

19:00.250 --> 19:04.040
Oh, it's all right. I have immunity
from the U.S. Attorney, and I

19:04.125 --> 19:08.124
have immunity from the risen Jesus.

19:08.208 --> 19:12.415
And nobody beats the Riz.
- Had you ever seen Dr. Lecter before

19:12.500 --> 19:16.707
you assigned to him for therapy?
- What do you mean? Socially?

19:18.958 --> 19:22.499
That is what I mean, yes, if you
don't mind talking about it.

19:22.583 --> 19:26.165
Oh, no, not at all. I'm not ashamed.
- I didn't say you should be.

19:26.250 --> 19:30.165
No, we met conventionally.
As doctor and patient.

19:30.250 --> 19:34.415
How did he end up at your house?
- I invited him, of course.

19:36.125 --> 19:40.040
To my pied-a-terre.
I came to the door

19:40.125 --> 19:44.540
in my nicest fit.
I was concerned

19:44.625 --> 19:48.457
he'd be afraid of me.
But he didn't seem to be.

19:48.541 --> 19:51.624
"Afraid of me."

19:52.958 --> 19:56.165
That's almost funny now.

19:56.250 --> 19:59.415
I showed him my toys, my noose

19:59.500 --> 20:04.082
set-up among other things.
It's where you sort of hang yourself

20:04.166 --> 20:08.249
but not really.
It feels good while you are...

20:08.333 --> 20:12.707
well, you know. Anyway, he said,

20:13.708 --> 20:17.540
"Mason, would you like a popper?"

20:17.625 --> 20:22.790
And I said, "Would I?"
And, wow, once that kicked in...

20:23.000 --> 20:28.207
I was flying. He said, "Mason,
show me how you smile

20:28.458 --> 20:32.290
to gain the confidence of a child."

20:32.375 --> 20:36.832
When I smiled he said,
"Oh, I see how you do it."

20:38.083 --> 20:41.957
The good doctor approached me
with a piece of broken mirror.

20:42.208 --> 20:47.165
Try this.
Try peeling off your face

20:47.708 --> 20:51.957
and feeding it to the dogs.

20:59.333 --> 21:02.374
Try again.

21:02.458 --> 21:06.624
No, I can still see it.
No, I'm afraid not.

21:07.583 --> 21:10.915
"That's entertainment!"

21:12.333 --> 21:15.957
Well, it seemed like a good idea
at the time.

21:16.041 --> 21:21.165
Mr. Verger, you indicated to me that
you'd received new information.

21:23.666 --> 21:25.874
Cordell!

21:39.375 --> 21:42.999
Where did this come from?
- Buenos Aires.

21:43.250 --> 21:46.749
I received it two weeks ago.

21:46.833 --> 21:50.874
Where is the package it came in?
- Good question. There was nothing

21:50.958 --> 21:55.790
written on it of interest.
Cordell, did we throw it out?

21:55.875 --> 22:00.874
Yes, I'm afraid we did.
- Oh, dear. You think it'll help?

22:00.958 --> 22:05.165
I hope so. I hope it'll help
you catch him

22:05.250 --> 22:09.624
to help cleanse the stigma of
your recent dishonor.

22:09.791 --> 22:13.874
Thank you. I think that's all I need.
- Did you find some rapport

22:13.958 --> 22:18.499
with Doctor Lecter in your talks
at the asylum?

22:18.583 --> 22:23.790
I know I did while I was peeling.
- We exchanged infos in a civil way.

22:23.875 --> 22:27.999
But always through the glass.
- Yes.

22:38.875 --> 22:42.624
Isn't it funny?
- What's that?

22:42.708 --> 22:46.207
You can look at my face

22:46.291 --> 22:51.040
but you shied when I said
the name of God.

23:16.041 --> 23:20.040
Finding what you want?
- Are you sure this is all of it?

23:20.125 --> 23:24.374
That's all there is now. It was more,
but it's been picked over the years.

23:27.041 --> 23:31.457
You know, this stuff's worth a
lot of money in certain circles.

23:31.541 --> 23:35.707
It's kind of like the cocaine that
disappears around here time by time.

24:59.958 --> 25:04.082
Hey, Barney. Remember me?

25:04.208 --> 25:08.832
Would you agree for the record, Agent
Starling I've not been read my rights?

25:12.708 --> 25:17.332
I have not mirandized Barney.
He is unaware of his rights.

25:19.041 --> 25:23.207
So when you turned him over to the...
- They weren't civil to him.

25:23.291 --> 25:27.540
And they're all dead now.
- They survived his company 3 days.

25:28.041 --> 25:32.582
You survived him 6 years at
the asylum. How'd you do that?

25:33.000 --> 25:36.540
It wasn't just being civil.
- Yes, it was.

25:36.625 --> 25:40.707
Did you ever think after he escaped
he might come after you?

25:40.791 --> 25:46.165
No. He once told me that, whenever
feasible, he preferred to eat rude.

25:46.250 --> 25:50.332
Free-range rude, he called 'em.
What about you? You ever think

25:50.416 --> 25:53.999
he might come after you?
Oh... you ever think about him at all?

25:54.083 --> 25:58.165
Oh, at least 30 seconds of every day.
I can't help it. He's always with me,

25:58.250 --> 26:02.332
like a bad habit. Do you, do you know

26:02.416 --> 26:05.957
what happened to his stuff?
His books, papers, drawings and...

26:06.041 --> 26:10.082
Everything got thrown away when the
place closed. Oh, cutbacks.

26:10.166 --> 26:13.749
Barney, I just found out that
Doctor Lecter's signed copy of

26:13.833 --> 26:18.457
"The Joy of Cooking" sold to a private
collector for 16.000 dollars.

26:18.625 --> 26:22.415
Whew! It was probably a fake.
- The seller's affidavit of

26:22.500 --> 26:26.957
ownership was signed Karen Phlox.
Do you know Karen Phlox? You should.

26:27.125 --> 26:31.207
She filled out your employment
application, only at the bottom

26:31.291 --> 26:36.165
she signed it Barney.
The same thing on your tax returns.

26:38.208 --> 26:41.832
You want the book?
Maybe I can get it back.

26:41.916 --> 26:45.874
I want the X-ray they shot after you
broke Lecter's arm during the attack

26:46.083 --> 26:50.457
on that nurse.
And everything else you got.

26:52.958 --> 26:56.832
We used to talk about a
lot of things at night.

26:56.916 --> 27:01.124
After the screamin’ finally died down.

27:03.291 --> 27:07.582
We talked about you sometimes.
You want to know what he said?

27:07.666 --> 27:11.749
Go get the X-ray.

27:15.916 --> 27:19.499
I'm not a bad guy.
- I didn't say you were.

27:19.583 --> 27:23.665
Doctor Chilton was a bad guy.
After your first visit,

27:23.750 --> 27:27.874
he started taping your conversations
with Doctor Lecter.

27:29.083 --> 27:32.540
These are valuable.

27:36.958 --> 27:40.915
Go on now.
You've grieved long enough.

27:45.416 --> 27:49.749
And what'd he say?
What'd he say about me late at night?

27:50.916 --> 27:54.999
Well, he was talkin’ about inherited,
hardwired behavior.

27:55.083 --> 27:58.957
He was using genetics in the roller
pigeons as an example. They fly way

27:59.041 --> 28:03.124
up in the air, roll over backwards in
a display, fallin' toward the ground.

28:03.208 --> 28:07.290
There are shallow rollers and there
are deep rollers. But you can't breed

28:07.375 --> 28:11.457
2 deep rollers or their young, their
offspring, will roll all the way down,

28:11.541 --> 28:16.540
hit and die. Agent Starling is a deep
roller, Barney. Let us hope one of

28:16.625 --> 28:21.249
her parents was not.
Surely, the odd confluence of events

28:21.333 --> 28:25.040
hasn't escaped you, Clarice.

28:25.125 --> 28:30.290
Jack Crawford dangles you in front of
me, then I give you a bit of help.

28:30.958 --> 28:35.249
Do you think it's because I like to
look at you and imagine

28:35.333 --> 28:39.457
how good you would taste, Clarice?

28:39.541 --> 28:43.790
(Clarice) I don't know. Is it?

28:43.875 --> 28:47.957
(Lecter) I've been in this room for
8 years now. I know they will never,

28:48.041 --> 28:52.374
ever let me out while I'm alive.

28:52.500 --> 28:56.749
What I want is a view. I want
a window where I can see a tree

28:56.833 --> 29:01.082
or even water. I want to be
in a federal institution.

29:15.083 --> 29:19.165
The Capponi correspondence goes back
to the thirteenth century.

29:19.250 --> 29:23.332
Doctor Fell might hold in his hand,
his non Italian hand, a note from

29:23.416 --> 29:27.499
Dante Alighieri himself
but would he recognize it?

29:27.583 --> 29:30.749
I think not.

29:30.833 --> 29:34.915
Gentlemen, you have examined him in
medieval Italian, and I will not deny

29:35.000 --> 29:39.374
that his language is admirable
for a straniero, but is he

29:39.458 --> 29:44.040
acquainted with the personalities
of the pre-Renaissance Firenze?

29:44.125 --> 29:48.207
I think not. What if he came upon a
note in the Capponi library, say,

29:48.291 --> 29:52.582
from Guido de Cavalcanti?
Would he recognize that? I think not.

29:56.208 --> 29:59.832
They're still arguing.

30:01.250 --> 30:05.165
Sogliato wants the job for his nephew.
But the scholars seem satisfied

30:05.250 --> 30:08.915
with the temporary guy they appointed.
- Mm.

30:09.000 --> 30:13.082
If he's such an expert on Dante, let
him lecture on Dante to the Studiolo.

30:13.166 --> 30:17.249
Let him face them if he can.
- I look forward to it.

30:17.333 --> 30:21.707
Let's set a date.
- Very well. On the fourteenth.

30:38.625 --> 30:42.790
Doctor Fell? Chief Inspector
Rinaldo Pazzi of the Questura.

30:44.083 --> 30:47.874
Commendatore. How can I be of service?

30:47.958 --> 30:52.457
I'm sorry. I'm investigating the
disappearance of your predecessor,

30:52.833 --> 30:57.749
Signore de Bonaventura. I was...
- Predecessor implies I have the job.

30:57.833 --> 31:01.499
Unfortunately, I don't. Not yet.
Though I am hopeful.

31:01.583 --> 31:05.415
They are letting me look
after the library. For a stipend.

31:05.500 --> 31:09.832
Hm. Uh, the officers who first
checked didn't find any sort of

31:09.916 --> 31:14.082
farewell or suicide note.
Eh, I was wondering if you...

31:14.708 --> 31:19.249
If I happen to come across anything in
the Capponi library stuffed in a

31:19.333 --> 31:23.165
drawer or book, I'll call you at once.
- Thank you.

31:26.250 --> 31:30.457
You've been reassigned.

31:31.083 --> 31:35.249
Pardon?
- You were on the Il Mostro case.

31:35.750 --> 31:39.290
Yes, that's right.
- Now you're on this. This is much less

31:39.375 --> 31:43.457
grand a case, I would think.
- Well, if I thought of my work in

31:43.541 --> 31:47.665
those terms, yes, I guess I'd agree.
- A missing person.

31:49.208 --> 31:52.749
Sorry?
- Were you unfairly dismissed from the

31:52.833 --> 31:56.499
grander case or did you deserve it?

31:59.750 --> 32:04.249
Regarding this one, Doctor Fell
are the Signore's personal effects

32:04.333 --> 32:08.582
still at the Palazzo?
- Mm-hm. Packed neatly in 4 cases

32:09.083 --> 32:13.457
with an inventory. Alas no note.

32:13.541 --> 32:15.624
Mmh.

32:15.916 --> 32:21.124
Well, I'll send someone
over to pick them up. Thank you.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.957
Hey, thanks.

32:34.500 --> 32:38.165
How's it goin'? Any leads?
- Yeah, they're all leads.

32:38.250 --> 32:41.957
They just don't lead to him.

32:44.750 --> 32:49.040
How do you live with this stuff.
- Oh, God.

32:49.125 --> 32:53.249
This is from the Guinness Book of
World records, congratulating me on

32:53.333 --> 32:56.957
being "The Female F.B.I. Agent Who
Has Shot and Killed the Most People."

33:19.250 --> 33:22.832
Geoffrey, would you excuse me, please?

33:22.916 --> 33:24.957
Sure.

33:50.875 --> 33:54.957
Dear Clarice: I have followed
with enthusiasm the course of your

33:55.041 --> 33:59.124
disgrace and public shaming.
My own never bothered me,

33:59.208 --> 34:03.082
except for the inconvenience
of being incarcerated.

34:03.166 --> 34:07.332
But you may lack perspective. In our
discussions down in the dungeon,

34:07.666 --> 34:12.165
it was apparent to me that your
father, the dead night watchman,

34:12.666 --> 34:17.665
figures largely in your value system.

34:17.875 --> 34:21.623
To end James Gumb's career as
a couturier

34:21.708 --> 34:25.623
pleased you most because you could
imagine your father being pleased.

34:25.708 --> 34:29.706
But now, alas, you're in bad odor
with the F.B.I.

34:29.791 --> 34:33.706
Do you imagine your daddy being shamed
by your disgrace? Do you see him

34:33.791 --> 34:37.623
in his plain pine box,
crushed by your failure?

34:37.708 --> 34:41.456
The sorry,
petty end of a promising career?

34:41.541 --> 34:45.623
What is worst about this humiliation,
Clarice?

34:45.708 --> 34:49.498
Is it how your failure will reflect
on your mommy and daddy?

34:49.583 --> 34:53.665
Is your worst fear that people will
now and forever believe they were

34:53.750 --> 34:58.207
indeed just good old trailer camp,
tornado-bait, white trash?

34:58.291 --> 35:02.040
And that perhaps you are, too? Hm?

35:03.708 --> 35:08.540
By the way, I couldn't help noticing
on the F.B.I.'s rather dull public

35:08.625 --> 35:12.374
web site that I have been hoisted from
the Bureau's archives of the common

35:12.458 --> 35:16.749
criminal and elevated to the more
prestigious Ten Most Wanted list.

35:17.500 --> 35:21.832
Is this coincidence, or are you back
on the case? If so, goody goody,

35:22.333 --> 35:26.374
'cause I need to come out
of retirement

35:26.458 --> 35:30.290
and return to public life.
I imagine

35:30.375 --> 35:34.832
you sitting in a dark basement room,
bent over papers and computer screens.

35:35.625 --> 35:39.707
Is that accurate?
Please tell me truly,

35:39.791 --> 35:42.332
Special Agent Starling.

35:42.416 --> 35:46.957
Regards, your old pal,
Hannibal Lecter, M. D.

35:47.041 --> 35:51.749
P.S. Clearly this new assignment
is not your choice.

35:51.833 --> 35:56.749
Rather, I suppose, it is part of the
bargain. But you accepted it, Clarice.

35:57.375 --> 36:01.457
Your job is to craft my doom. So I am
not sure how well I should wish you,

36:01.541 --> 36:06.082
but I'm sure we'll have a lot of fun.

36:06.375 --> 36:10.290
Ta-ta. H.

36:16.166 --> 36:21.124
On the letter there's one partial
fingerprint, here. Not enough...

36:21.916 --> 36:26.082
Well, I know it's him. Where he was
when he wrote it is what I need.

36:26.166 --> 36:30.249
Well, the paper isn't gonna help.
And, yes, it's linen fiber, yes,

36:30.333 --> 36:34.415
it's on the expensive side but, no, it
isn't so rare that you're not gonna be

36:34.500 --> 36:39.582
able to find it in a 1000 stationery
stores throughout the world. Same with

36:39.666 --> 36:43.749
the ink. And the same with the wax.
And your Las Vegas postmark, well you

36:43.833 --> 36:48.165
can check it out, but I'll bet a buck
it came from a remailing service.

36:48.250 --> 36:53.457
No. It would be the last place he'd be.
An assault on his sense of taste.

37:00.291 --> 37:04.332
Don't you feel eyes moving
over your body, Clarice?

37:04.416 --> 37:08.499
I hardly see how you couldn't.
And don't your eyes move over

37:08.583 --> 37:12.749
the things you want?
- All right, then tell me how...

37:13.333 --> 37:17.874
No. It's your turn to tell me. You
don't have any more vacations to sell.

37:22.166 --> 37:26.457
Quid pro quo, Clarice. I tell you
things, you tell me things.

37:26.541 --> 37:30.915
Not about this case. About yourself.
Quid pro quo.

37:31.375 --> 37:34.499
Yes or no, Clarice?

37:46.041 --> 37:48.124
Hand cream.

37:49.708 --> 37:53.332
Raw ambergris base.

37:53.416 --> 37:56.499
Tennessee lavender.

37:57.083 --> 38:00.999
Trace of something else.

38:01.083 --> 38:04.874
Fleece. Lovely.
- What's ambergris?

38:06.458 --> 38:10.707
Ambergris is a whale product.
Alas, much as we'd like to,

38:10.791 --> 38:14.749
we'd can't import it.
Endangered Species Act.

38:14.833 --> 38:19.374
Where isn't it illegal?
- Japan, of course. Couple of places in

38:19.500 --> 38:24.665
Europe. You'd almost certainly find it
somewhere in Paris, Rome, Amsterdam.

38:25.125 --> 38:29.082
Maybe London.
- This bouquet was hand engineered

38:29.166 --> 38:32.957
to someone's specifications.
- Is there any way of knowing where?

38:33.041 --> 38:37.749
Of course. We'll give you a list.
It'll be short

38:49.041 --> 38:52.874
I need opera tickets.
- I don't think I got any on me.

38:52.958 --> 38:56.915
It's sold out, whatever it's called.

38:57.000 --> 39:01.332
It's the pretty young wife with the
ever-open break who needs tickets.

39:09.666 --> 39:11.665
Benetti.
- What?

39:11.750 --> 39:16.540
Rewind it.
- I can't rewind it. I'm making a copy.

39:27.625 --> 39:31.165
What is this?
- Security camera from a perfume-shop

39:31.250 --> 39:34.832
on Via Della Scala. F.B.I. Through
Interpol requested a copy.

39:34.916 --> 39:38.249
Why?
- They didn't say.

39:38.333 --> 39:41.999
They didn't say?
- No. It was actually kind of weird,

39:42.083 --> 39:46.540
like they were making
a point not to say.

41:28.625 --> 41:33.040
Are we going to the opera?
- Yes. Sorry.

41:33.125 --> 41:36.332
Yes, we are going.
- You got tickets.

41:36.416 --> 41:40.665
No, but I will. In fact,
I was just about to look here.

41:40.750 --> 41:45.707
Please not the back row.
I would like to see it this time.

41:46.583 --> 41:50.915
Nowhere near the back row.
No matter what the cost.

43:00.708 --> 43:03.832
Hannibal Lecter

43:59.708 --> 44:03.790
Tell me, Clarice, would you want
to harm those who have forced you

44:03.875 --> 44:07.374
to consider it, though?
It's perfectly okay to feel this.

44:09.458 --> 44:13.624
It's perfectly au naturel
to want to taste the enemy.

44:17.791 --> 44:21.957
It just feels so good.
Tell me Clarice, what is your worst

44:29.250 --> 44:32.790
memory of childhood?
- Jesus, Starling!

44:32.875 --> 44:36.790
Can I help you, Mr. Krendler?
- What you doing there in the dark?

44:36.875 --> 44:40.832
Thinkin' about cannibalism.
- People in Justice are thinking, too.

44:40.916 --> 44:45.124
They're thinking, what is she doing?
- Aren't you curious why he dines on

44:45.208 --> 44:49.290
his victims?
What's the point? Are you writing

44:49.375 --> 44:53.457
a book or you catching a crook?
- To show his contempt for those who

44:53.541 --> 44:57.624
exasperate him. Or sometimes to
perform a public service. In the case

44:57.708 --> 45:01.790
of the flutist, Benjamin Raspail, he
did it to improve the sound of the

45:01.875 --> 45:05.957
Baltimore Philharmonic Orchestra,
serving the flute player's sweetbreads

45:06.041 --> 45:10.165
to the board with a nice Montrachet
at seven hundred dollars a bottle.

45:14.583 --> 45:19.207
That meal began with green oysters
from the Gironde, followed by the

45:19.583 --> 45:23.665
sweetbreads, a sorbet, and then you
can read here in Gourmet Cuisine:

45:23.750 --> 45:28.415
A notable dark and glossy ragout,
the constituents never determined.

45:28.500 --> 45:32.332
I always figured him for a queer.
- Why would you say that, Paul?

45:32.416 --> 45:36.874
Well, all this artsy-fartsy stuff.
Chamber music, tea party food.

45:36.958 --> 45:42.124
Not that I mean anything personal
if you've got a lot of sympathy.

45:44.375 --> 45:49.415
What I came here to impress upon you,
Starling, is I better see cooperation.

45:49.625 --> 45:54.249
There are no little fiefdoms here.
I want to be copied on every 302!

45:54.333 --> 45:57.999
Mm-hm.
- If you work with me,

45:58.083 --> 46:02.624
then your so-called career
here might improve.

46:02.708 --> 46:06.665
If you don't, then all I have to do
is draw a line through your name

46:06.750 --> 46:11.957
rather than under it and it's over.

46:12.125 --> 46:16.207
Paul, what is it with you?
I told you to go

46:16.291 --> 46:20.665
home to your wife. That was wrong?
- Don't flatter yourself, Starling.

46:20.791 --> 46:25.707
That was a long time ago. Why would I
hold that against you? Hm?

46:27.791 --> 46:32.582
And besides this town is full
of corn-pone country pussy.

46:33.708 --> 46:37.790
That said I wouldn't mind having
a go with you right now,

46:37.875 --> 46:41.499
if you want to reconsider.
- In the gym, anytime.

46:41.583 --> 46:44.457
No pads.

46:47.208 --> 46:51.999
Is it went out with the regular mail?
- No, I overnighted it to you.

46:52.083 --> 46:56.165
I filled out the slip myself.
This was the day after your request.

46:56.250 --> 47:01.165
I don't understand what happened.
I think you should have it by now.

47:01.250 --> 47:05.332
I don't. Can you send me another one?
- Sure. I will make another copy.

47:05.416 --> 47:09.624
Agent Clarice? Is that right?
Can I call you Clarice?

47:10.166 --> 47:14.415
Uh, Agent Starling. I'd appreciate it.
Uh, what's your name?

47:14.500 --> 47:18.999
Oh, my name is Franco Benetti.
- Thank you very much, Agent Benetti.

47:20.000 --> 47:24.207
Okay. So I'll send you tomorrow?
- All right. Bye-bye.

47:26.291 --> 47:29.790
Nothin', huh?
- Oh, nothin' yet. Still waitin'

47:29.875 --> 47:33.624
on Florence and London.

48:07.750 --> 48:12.124
(Operator) The number you have dialed
is not in service at this time.

48:36.291 --> 48:40.499
Yes? Hello?
- I have information about Lecter.

48:41.916 --> 48:45.749
Have you shared your information
with the police, sir?

48:45.833 --> 48:49.540
I'm required to encourage you to do so.
- Uh-huh.

48:49.625 --> 48:53.457
Is the reward payable
under special circumstances?

48:53.541 --> 48:57.124
May I suggest you contact an attorney
before taking any possibly

48:57.208 --> 49:01.290
illegal action? There's one in Geneva
who is excellent in these matters.

49:01.375 --> 49:05.249
May I give you his toll-free number?
The number is:

49:05.333 --> 49:09.999
0-0-4-1-2-2-3-1-7.

49:30.708 --> 49:34.499
Hello.
- I was just speaking with someone...

49:34.583 --> 49:38.665
There's a one hundred thousand dollar
advance. To qualify for the advance,

49:38.750 --> 49:42.582
a fingerprint must be provided,
in situ, on an object.

49:42.666 --> 49:46.749
Once the print has been positively,
the money will be placed in escrow at

49:46.833 --> 49:51.540
Geneve Credit Suisse and may be viewed
at any time subject to 24 hour prior

49:51.625 --> 49:55.165
notification. To repeat the message
in French, press two.

49:55.250 --> 49:59.415
In Spanish press three.
In German...

50:26.208 --> 50:30.040
Buon giorno.
Doctor Fell? It's Inspector Pazzi.

50:30.125 --> 50:34.665
Yes, I can see you.
Come on up.

50:45.708 --> 50:48.207
Doctor Fell?

50:53.000 --> 50:55.082
Hello?

50:59.541 --> 51:11.207
Doctor Fell?

51:11.916 --> 51:14.332
Hello?

51:27.000 --> 51:29.415
Snap.

51:29.500 --> 51:34.290
I should have encouraged you to bring
someone along. The cases are heavy.

51:34.375 --> 51:37.415
Maybe you could help me with them.
- Hm?

51:37.500 --> 51:40.999
Eh, just down the stairs, I mean.

51:42.291 --> 51:44.749
Yeah. This way.

51:47.416 --> 51:50.874
Here we are.

51:53.125 --> 51:57.165
Is that the inventory?
- Yes.

51:57.583 --> 52:01.415
May I see it?
- Of course.

52:10.375 --> 52:14.832
You are a Pazzi of the
Pazzi family, I think.

52:16.625 --> 52:20.957
Wasn't it at the Palazzo Vecchio
your ancestor was hanged?

52:21.041 --> 52:25.415
Francesco de Pazzi? Yes, thrown naked
with a noose around his neck

52:25.500 --> 52:29.999
from a window writhing and kicking
alongside the archbishop against

52:30.083 --> 52:33.165
the cold stone wall.

52:33.250 --> 52:37.332
In fact, I found a very nice
rendering of it here in the

52:37.416 --> 52:41.499
library the other day. If you like,
perhaps I could, uh,

52:41.583 --> 52:45.707
sneak it out for you.
- I would think that might jeopardize

52:45.791 --> 52:49.915
your chances for permanent appointment
to the curatorship.

52:50.541 --> 52:53.582
Only if you told.

52:53.666 --> 52:57.540
Remind me, what was his crime?
- He was accused of killing

52:57.625 --> 53:01.124
Giuliano de Medici.
- Oh. Unjustly?

53:01.208 --> 53:05.790
No. No. I don't think so.
- Then he wasn't just accused.

53:06.083 --> 53:09.874
He did it, he was guilty. I think
that would make living in Florence

53:09.958 --> 53:14.624
with the name Pazzi uncomfortable
even five hundred years later.

53:16.750 --> 53:20.790
Not really. In fact,
I can't remember the last time

53:20.875 --> 53:26.082
before today someone brought it up.

53:34.250 --> 53:37.790
People don't always tell you
what they're thinking.

53:37.875 --> 53:42.332
They just see to it you don't
advance in life.

53:46.708 --> 53:51.540
I'm sorry, Commendatore.
I too often say what I'm thinking.

53:54.250 --> 53:57.832
I'll be right back to help you.

54:10.541 --> 54:15.540
You know, the room you're standing in
was built in the fifteenth century.

54:15.625 --> 54:18.540
(Pazzi) It's beautiful.

54:18.625 --> 54:22.957
Yes, it is. Unfortunately, I think the
heating system was installed

54:23.166 --> 54:27.707
about the same time.

54:27.791 --> 54:32.124
That's a pity.
- Yes.

54:32.458 --> 54:36.707
Okey-dokey, let's drag these down.

54:36.791 --> 54:41.332
They must be as heavy as bodies.

55:13.958 --> 55:15.957
Hey.
- Yeah!

55:16.041 --> 55:18.165
How much is this?
- Fifty thousand.

55:18.250 --> 55:21.332
I'll take it.

55:43.750 --> 55:45.832
Gnocco.

55:52.166 --> 55:57.207
When you go for his wallet,
he'll catch you by the wrist.

55:57.291 --> 56:02.165
I've done this a few times.
- Not like this.

56:02.250 --> 56:06.207
If there isn't a clean print on the
bracelet you'll spend the summer

56:06.416 --> 56:09.874
in a cell at the Sollicciano.

56:11.375 --> 56:16.124
Give me the bracelet.
- Wash your fucking hands.

56:26.750 --> 56:28.999
He's coming.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.457
I got it.

58:25.666 --> 58:29.249
He grabbed me just right.

58:31.041 --> 58:36.082
Tried to hit me in the balls.

58:37.541 --> 58:41.749
But he missed.

58:44.458 --> 58:48.165
Let me help you.
- No, don't.

59:44.708 --> 59:48.957
Sixteen point match, Mister Verger.

59:49.041 --> 59:50.624
Bingo.

01:00:08.416 --> 01:00:11.332
Pronto.
- Carlo?

01:00:11.416 --> 01:00:14.540
Mason?
- Ciao, bello. Come stai?

01:00:14.625 --> 01:00:18.999
Uh, oh, oh, well, well, well.
Am I coming to see you?

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:22.582
Oh, yes, soon, I hope.

01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:26.624
But, uh... well, first I need you to
pack off the boys. Yes, I know,

01:00:26.708 --> 01:00:30.790
the day you never thought would
arrive has. Now, Cordell will fax

01:00:30.875 --> 01:00:34.957
the veterinary forms directly to
Animal and Plant Health

01:00:35.041 --> 01:00:39.707
but you need to get the vet
affidavits from Sardinia.

01:00:39.791 --> 01:00:43.207
Yeah. Va bene?
- Uh-huh, bene, bene.

01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:48.124
Uh, how are they?
Ah, they are big, Mason. Very big.

01:00:48.208 --> 01:00:51.499
Tommaso!

01:00:54.458 --> 01:00:58.624
Say again?
- They are big, Mason. Really big.

01:00:59.458 --> 01:01:03.415
Maybe two hundred and seventy kilos.
- Oh, wow!

01:01:04.208 --> 01:01:07.790
Can you hear?

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.624
Oh, they sound fantastic!

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.874
Oh, super!

01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:10.249
The full balance of the money is
payable upon receipt of the doctor

01:02:10.333 --> 01:02:14.499
alive. Of course, you won't have to
seize him yourself. Rather just point

01:02:14.583 --> 01:02:18.665
him out. In fact, it's preferable to
all concerned if that's the extent

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:22.915
of your involvement from this point.

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:27.040
I prefer to stay involved.
To make sure things go right.

01:02:27.541 --> 01:02:32.582
Professionals will see to that.
- I am a professional.

01:04:56.583 --> 01:05:00.832
You enjoy the performance?
- Oh, very much.

01:05:00.916 --> 01:05:05.290
Um, Allegra, this is Doctor Fell,
curator of the Capponi Library.

01:05:05.583 --> 01:05:10.457
Signora Pazzi. I'm honored.
- Are you from America, Doctor?

01:05:10.541 --> 01:05:15.040
Not originally. I've traveled there.
- I've always wanted to visit.

01:05:15.125 --> 01:05:19.874
New England, especially.
- I've enjoyed excellent meals there.

01:05:20.166 --> 01:05:24.874
You wrapped up in the libretto.
I thought this might amuse you.

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:33.624
Dante's sonnet from La Vita Nuova.
- Mm-hm. It's beautiful.

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:38.624
Rinaldo, look at this.
- Oh, yes, I can see.

01:05:38.708 --> 01:05:43.624
"Joyous Love seemed to me, the while
he held my heart in his hands

01:05:44.916 --> 01:05:49.457
and in his arms my lady lay asleep
wrapped in a veil."

01:05:51.541 --> 01:05:55.665
"He woke her then and trembling and
obedient, she ate that burning heart

01:05:55.750 --> 01:06:00.290
out of his hand. Weeping,
I saw him then depart from me."

01:06:00.666 --> 01:06:04.749
Doctor Fell, do you believe a man
could become so obsessed with a woman

01:06:04.833 --> 01:06:08.624
from a single encounter?
- Could he daily feel a stab of hunger

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:13.374
for her and find nourishment in the
very sight of her?

01:06:14.375 --> 01:06:18.582
I think so. But would she see
through the bars of his plight

01:06:19.083 --> 01:06:22.624
and ache for him?
Please keep that.

01:06:22.708 --> 01:06:26.707
Oh, I couldn't.
- I insist.

01:06:26.791 --> 01:06:29.915
Commendatore. Allegra.

01:06:33.375 --> 01:06:35.374
Ciao.
- Ciao.

01:06:35.458 --> 01:06:39.457
Uh, good-bye.
- Let's get something to eat.

01:06:39.541 --> 01:06:43.624
Of course.
- Why not?

01:07:15.791 --> 01:07:18.999
Is that you, Doctor?

01:08:07.291 --> 01:08:10.832
Questura. Pandolfini.
- Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi please.

01:08:10.916 --> 01:08:15.249
Agent Starling, American F.B.I.
- All right. Eh, one moment.

01:08:17.291 --> 01:08:21.499
Pazzi! F.B.I.
- I'm not here!

01:08:25.750 --> 01:08:29.749
Pazzi.
- Inspector Pazzi, Agent Starling,

01:08:29.832 --> 01:08:33.415
F.B.I. How do you do?
- I was just leaving for the day.

01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:37.165
Can I call you back tomorrow?
- Oh, this won't take long.

01:08:37.250 --> 01:08:41.832
First of all, I'd like to thank you
for sending us the security tape.

01:08:41.916 --> 01:08:45.624
When I say you, I mean your department.
Agent Benetti.

01:08:45.707 --> 01:08:50.457
Is he there? Can I speak with him?
- I'm sorry, he's gone home.

01:08:50.707 --> 01:08:54.415
Oh, that's all right. I should tell
you this rather than him anyway.

01:08:54.500 --> 01:08:58.457
I'm late for an important appointment.
- Well, the person I'm looking for,

01:08:58.541 --> 01:09:03.374
Inspector, who was indeed shown on
that tape, is Hannibal Lecter.

01:09:03.457 --> 01:09:07.082
Who?
- Doctor Hannibal Lecter. Never heard?

01:09:07.166 --> 01:09:10.457
Umm, uh, I'm not familiar.
- And the tape confirms

01:09:10.541 --> 01:09:14.749
that he is, or was recently,
in Florence.

01:09:14.957 --> 01:09:18.499
Oh, really?
- He's a very dangerous man, Inspector.

01:09:18.582 --> 01:09:22.957
He's killed 14 people that we know of.
- I really have to go, Miss, uh, eh?

01:09:23.207 --> 01:09:27.749
Starling. Just another minute. Are you
sure you've never heard of him?

01:09:27.832 --> 01:09:31.207
No, I haven't.
- I'm confused, because someone there

01:09:31.291 --> 01:09:35.374
has been accessing our private VICAP
files on Doctor Lecter with some

01:09:35.457 --> 01:09:39.624
regularity on your computer.
- Everybody uses everybody's computer

01:09:40.541 --> 01:09:44.624
here. Maybe one of the detectives on
Il Mostro was looking at profiles

01:09:44.707 --> 01:09:48.582
of killers...
- I'm speaking about the computer

01:09:48.666 --> 01:09:53.165
at your home, sir. You're trying to
catch him yourself, aren't you?

01:09:53.750 --> 01:09:57.832
For the reward. I cannot warn you
strongly enough against that.

01:09:57.916 --> 01:10:01.999
He killed three policemen down in
Memphis while in custody,

01:10:02.083 --> 01:10:06.207
tearing the face off one of them,
and he will kill you, too, if...

01:10:38.166 --> 01:10:41.665
Yes?
- I want him out of Tuscany fast.

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:45.832
Believe me he'll be gone from the
face of the Earth fast.

01:10:45.916 --> 01:10:48.374
Feet first.

01:11:07.041 --> 01:11:10.999
Because of his avarice and his
betrayal of the Emperor’s trust

01:11:11.083 --> 01:11:15.457
Pier della Vigna was disgraced,
blinded and imprisoned.

01:11:15.875 --> 01:11:20.040
Dante's pilgrim finds Pier della Vigna
on the seventh level of the Inferno,

01:11:20.166 --> 01:11:24.582
and like Judas Iscariot,
he died by hanging.

01:11:24.666 --> 01:11:28.749
So Judas and Pier della Vigna are
linked in Dante by the avarice he saw

01:11:28.833 --> 01:11:32.915
in them. In fact, avarice and hanging
are linked in the medieval mind.

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:37.082
Now this was the earliest known
depiction of the Crucifixion,

01:11:37.166 --> 01:11:41.249
carved on an ivory box in Gaul about
A.D. Four hundred.

01:11:41.333 --> 01:11:45.665
It includes the death by hanging of
Judas, his face upturned to the

01:11:46.083 --> 01:11:50.165
branch that suspends him.
Here he is again on the doors

01:11:50.250 --> 01:11:54.332
of the Benevento Cathedral,

01:11:54.416 --> 01:11:58.540
this time with his bowels falling out.

01:11:58.875 --> 01:12:02.707
Ah, Commendatore Pazzi.
- It wasn't easy, but I got

01:12:03.041 --> 01:12:07.249
this number without tellin' 'em why.
- Sorry.

01:12:07.333 --> 01:12:11.665
Not at all. Welcome.
Please join us.

01:12:11.750 --> 01:12:15.624
Now, in this plate from the fifteenth
century edition of the Inferno,

01:12:15.708 --> 01:12:19.790
Pier della Vigna's body hangs from a
bleeding tree. I will not belabor the

01:12:19.875 --> 01:12:23.957
obvious parallel with Judas Iscariot,
but Dante Alighieri

01:12:24.041 --> 01:12:28.124
needed no drawn illustration. It was
his genius to make Pier della Vigna,

01:12:28.208 --> 01:12:32.540
now in hell speak in strained hisses
and coughing sibilants as though

01:12:32.875 --> 01:12:36.957
he is hanging still.

01:12:37.041 --> 01:12:40.624
Come I'altre verrem per nostre
spoglie.

01:12:40.791 --> 01:12:43.749
Ma no pero ch'alcuna sen rivesta.

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.957
Che non e giusto aver cio ch'om si
toglie. Que le strascineremo,

01:12:49.041 --> 01:12:53.374
e per la mesta selva saranno i nostri
corpi appesi.

01:12:54.666 --> 01:12:58.832
Ciascuno al prun de I'ombra
sua molesta.

01:12:59.916 --> 01:13:03.832
Avarice, hanging, self-destruction.

01:13:04.333 --> 01:13:07.999
Io fei guibbetto a me de le mie case.

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:12.582
I make my own home be my gallows.

01:13:14.708 --> 01:13:19.249
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for your kind attention.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.582
I'm not a scholar, but I think you've
got the job.

01:13:37.666 --> 01:13:41.207
Thank you.
- May I buy you a drink?

01:13:41.291 --> 01:13:45.457
Fine. I'll gathering my things.
- Oh, well, take your time.

01:13:55.208 --> 01:13:59.040
Yeah?
- Allegra, I'll be home just a little

01:13:59.125 --> 01:14:04.249
later than I said. I'm taking Doctor
Fell out for a drink. Yes.

01:14:04.625 --> 01:14:09.415
Yeah. I can see the people
coming out now.

01:14:10.875 --> 01:14:15.165
Yes, bye, honey. My wife.
- Of course.

01:14:17.125 --> 01:14:21.749
Oh, I should have shown them this one.
I can't imagine how I missed it.

01:14:21.833 --> 01:14:26.082
I told you about it. It's a rendering
I found in the Capponi library.

01:14:26.916 --> 01:14:30.790
Can you make it out?
There's a name there.

01:14:32.125 --> 01:14:35.999
The one I told you about?

01:14:47.041 --> 01:14:52.040
It's your ancestor, Commendatore,
hanging beneath these very windows.

01:14:52.125 --> 01:14:55.165
Francesco de Pazzi.

01:14:55.250 --> 01:14:58.957
On a related subject,
I must confess to you

01:14:59.041 --> 01:15:02.540
I'm giving very serious thought

01:15:07.541 --> 01:15:10.874
to eating your wife.

01:15:43.291 --> 01:15:47.374
So I'll ask you the questions

01:15:47.458 --> 01:15:52.582
and then we'll see, all right?

01:15:52.875 --> 01:15:54.957
Okay?

01:16:10.166 --> 01:16:14.415
Now, was it Mason Verger
you sold me to?

01:16:14.958 --> 01:16:18.790
No, no, no.
Blink twice for yes, once for no.

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:22.999
Was it Mason Verger you sold me to?

01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:27.582
Yes? Good. Thank you. And are
his men waiting for me outside?

01:16:29.958 --> 01:16:34.207
Was that a single blink?
Oh, you're confused. Well, please

01:16:34.291 --> 01:16:39.249
don't be confused, because I may have
to fillet Signora Pazzi after all.

01:16:41.041 --> 01:16:44.999
Have you told anyone
in the Questura about me?

01:16:45.083 --> 01:16:49.665
No, I thought not.
Have you told Allegra?

01:16:53.291 --> 01:16:56.374
No? You sure?

01:16:56.916 --> 01:17:00.082
I believe you.

01:17:01.416 --> 01:17:05.290
Okey-dokey, here we go.

01:17:10.250 --> 01:17:12.332
Okay.

01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:16.832
Your heart is really palpitating.
Oh, it's not your heart.

01:17:17.666 --> 01:17:21.082
Well, shall I answer it?

01:17:23.583 --> 01:17:27.124
Pronto.
- I've spoken to your section chief.

01:17:27.208 --> 01:17:31.957
Someday you'll thank me, or you won't.
I don't care. You'll be alive.

01:17:32.125 --> 01:17:36.707
Inspector Pazzi?
- Is this Clarice?

01:17:37.958 --> 01:17:42.957
Well, hello, Clarice.
I'm afraid I have bad news for you.

01:17:43.041 --> 01:17:46.582
Is he dead?
- Did you get my note? I hope you liked

01:17:46.666 --> 01:17:50.874
the skin cream. I had it specially...
- Is he dead, Doctor Lecter?

01:17:50.958 --> 01:17:55.040
Clarice, there's nothing in this world
that I would love more than to be able

01:17:55.125 --> 01:17:59.207
to chat with you. Unfortunately,
you've caught me at an awkward moment.

01:17:59.291 --> 01:18:03.415
Please forgive me. See you around.

01:18:04.583 --> 01:18:07.957
An old friend.

01:18:10.625 --> 01:18:13.790
Okay, hold on.

01:18:13.875 --> 01:18:16.707
Here we go.

01:18:47.916 --> 01:18:52.790
I'll go around back! Cut him!
Kill him if you have to!

01:18:55.000 --> 01:19:00.040
So, what's it to be? Bowels in or
bowels out? Like Judas.

01:19:01.666 --> 01:19:06.332
Are you confused? Then I'll decide
for you, if you'll permit me.

01:19:08.541 --> 01:19:10.874
Ciao.

01:20:10.500 --> 01:20:17.624
Carlo!

01:20:17.708 --> 01:20:19.790
Yes?

01:20:19.875 --> 01:20:22.332
Good evening.

01:21:28.333 --> 01:21:30.499
Cordell,

01:21:31.541 --> 01:21:35.707
to you, does that look like a
wave good-bye

01:21:35.791 --> 01:21:40.082
or hello?

01:22:25.666 --> 01:22:29.457
So, what do you think?
Does Lecter want to

01:22:30.416 --> 01:22:34.624
fuck her or kill her or eat her or what?
- Probably all three,

01:22:35.333 --> 01:22:39.832
though I wouldn't want to predict
in what order.

01:22:40.416 --> 01:22:45.040
Here's what I think. No matter how
Barney might want to romanticize

01:22:46.458 --> 01:22:50.707
it or make it "Beauty and the Beast".

01:22:51.375 --> 01:22:56.499
Lecter's object,
as I know from personal experience,

01:22:56.666 --> 01:23:01.249
has always been degradation
and suffering, but...

01:23:01.333 --> 01:23:06.540
Cordell, get this damn thing off me.
I can't breathe in this thing.

01:23:07.916 --> 01:23:12.582
He comes in the guise of a mentor,
as he did with me and her.

01:23:13.250 --> 01:23:18.415
But it's distress that excites him.

01:23:18.916 --> 01:23:23.582
To draw him
she needs to be distressed.

01:23:27.833 --> 01:23:31.915
To make her attractive to him,
let him see her distressed.

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:37.165
Let the damage he sees
suggest the damage

01:23:38.416 --> 01:23:42.374
he could do.

01:23:49.375 --> 01:23:54.249
When the fox hears the rabbit scream,
he comes a-runnin'

01:23:54.833 --> 01:23:58.332
but not to help.
- I don't understand.

01:23:58.416 --> 01:24:02.499
Well, there's nothing to understand,
Paul. All you have to understand is,

01:24:02.583 --> 01:24:06.332
is what it's worth to you.
- No, no, I don't understand

01:24:06.416 --> 01:24:10.499
why she didn't turn this over. I mean,
she's such a straight arrow.

01:24:10.583 --> 01:24:14.665
She didn't turn it over because
she didn't receive it. She didn't

01:24:14.750 --> 01:24:18.832
receive it because it was never sent.
It was never sent because Lecter

01:24:18.916 --> 01:24:23.332
didn't write it, because I did.
- Oh!

01:24:26.333 --> 01:24:29.874
So, what do you think?
- You'd have been better off if you

01:24:29.958 --> 01:24:34.040
never got her out of trouble.
- Oh, woulda, shoulda, coulda! I meant,

01:24:34.125 --> 01:24:37.165
what do you think about the money?
- Five.

01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:41.707
Ha! Oh, well, let's just
toss it off, like "5". Let's say it

01:24:42.375 --> 01:24:46.915
with the respect it deserves.
- Five hundred thousand dollars.

01:24:48.541 --> 01:24:53.165
That's better. Well, will it work?
- It'll work. It won't be pretty.

01:24:55.125 --> 01:24:58.415
What ever is?

01:25:00.625 --> 01:25:05.499
Cocksucker.
- I've never seen this before.

01:25:06.041 --> 01:25:10.040
Then how do you account for its being
found in your office? Your basement.

01:25:10.125 --> 01:25:14.207
How do you want me to answer that?
Let me ask you this: What possible

01:25:14.291 --> 01:25:18.874
reason might I have to withhold it?
- Perhaps because of the content.

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:24.040
Reads to me like a love letter.
- Has it been tested for prints?

01:25:24.125 --> 01:25:27.707
No prints on it. Like the last one.
- Handwriting analysis?

01:25:27.791 --> 01:25:31.999
"Did you ever think, Clarice, why the
Philistines don't understand you?

01:25:32.083 --> 01:25:36.165
It's because you're the answer to
Samson's riddle: You are the honey in

01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:40.082
the lion." It sounds like him to me.
- Do you mean, like a homosexual?

01:25:40.166 --> 01:25:43.707
Like a nut with a crush.
- Excuse me...

01:25:43.791 --> 01:25:48.832
I am placing you on administrative
leave till Document Analysis tells me

01:25:48.958 --> 01:25:53.040
unequivocally a mistake's been made.
You remain eligible for insurance and

01:25:53.125 --> 01:25:57.749
medical benefits. Surrender your
weapons and your identification.

01:26:09.708 --> 01:26:14.499
I want to say something. I'm entitled.
- Go ahead.

01:26:15.208 --> 01:26:19.124
I think Verger is trying to capture
Dr. Lecter for the purposes of

01:26:19.208 --> 01:26:23.290
personal revenge. And Mr. Krendler is
in collusion with him and wants the

01:26:23.375 --> 01:26:27.832
F.B.I.'s efforts to work for Verger.
I think he is being paid to do this.

01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:31.999
You're lucky you're not sworn here.
- Swear me! You swear, too!

01:26:32.083 --> 01:26:36.165
Clarice, if the evidence is lacking,
you'll be entitled to full

01:26:36.250 --> 01:26:40.457
reinstatement without prejudice.
If you don't do or say anything

01:26:40.583 --> 01:26:44.624
in the meantime that would make
that impossible.

01:26:44.708 --> 01:26:48.790
Relieved of field duty pending an
internal affairs into the charges,

01:26:48.875 --> 01:26:52.957
Agent Starling, began her career with
an assignment to interview madman

01:26:53.041 --> 01:26:57.124
Hannibal Lecter. Earlier today we
heard comments from Justice Department

01:26:57.208 --> 01:27:01.290
spokesman Paul Krendler.
- Mr. Krendler, can you comment the

01:27:01.375 --> 01:27:06.499
decision at this morning's meeting?
- F.B.I. And Justice Department are

01:27:06.583 --> 01:27:10.540
looking carefully into the charges,
and, yes, they're extremely serious.

01:27:10.625 --> 01:27:14.707
I'd like to add a personal note.
Starling is one of the best agents

01:27:14.791 --> 01:27:18.707
that we have...
No, no, no, no, no. Stay. Stay.

01:27:19.791 --> 01:27:23.874
Do you think that...
- Look, it's much too soon

01:27:23.958 --> 01:27:27.332
to condemn her. Okay?

01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.249
Shh... shh... shh.

01:28:12.541 --> 01:28:15.249
Good boy.

01:28:27.333 --> 01:28:30.290
Ah, and this.

01:30:56.458 --> 01:31:00.874
I think she's nice.
She's always been nice to me. Polite.

01:31:01.958 --> 01:31:05.999
Don't you think?
- Do you know what a roller pigeon is?

01:31:06.083 --> 01:31:10.165
Roller pigeons climb high and fast,
then roll over and

01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:14.415
fall just as fast towards the earth.
There are shallow and deep rollers.

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:19.624
But you can't breed two deep rollers,
or their young, their offspring,

01:31:19.708 --> 01:31:24.832
will roll all the way down, hit and
die. Agent Starling is a deep roller.

01:31:26.083 --> 01:31:30.665
Let's hope one of her parents was not.

01:32:58.333 --> 01:33:01.582
Hello?
- The power on that battery is low.

01:33:01.666 --> 01:33:05.749
I would have changed it, but I didn't
want to wake you. You're gonna have to

01:33:05.833 --> 01:33:09.915
use the other one, in the charger.
Hopefully the light on it is green.

01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.082
This is gonna be a long call. Even
though you've been stripped of your

01:33:14.166 --> 01:33:18.332
duties, I know you wouldn't abandon
them, you'll try to put on a trace.

01:33:18.416 --> 01:33:22.540
So, we'll disconnect long enough for
you to exchange the battery.

01:33:22.625 --> 01:33:27.374
Shall we say... uh, three seconds?
Are you ready?

01:33:27.458 --> 01:33:30.790
Yes.
- Go.

01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:36.749
Very good.
- Thank you.

01:33:36.833 --> 01:33:40.915
Remember, Clarice, if you get caught
with a concealed, unlicensed firearm

01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:45.082
in the District of Columbia,
the penalty is pretty stiff.

01:33:45.166 --> 01:33:49.624
But bring the guns if you have to.
Now get in your car.

01:34:23.125 --> 01:34:27.207
The reason we're doing it
like this, Clarice, is because

01:34:27.291 --> 01:34:31.374
I like to watch you as we speak,
with your eyes open. No, it

01:34:31.458 --> 01:34:36.290
does not excite me. It pleases me.
You have very shapely feet.

01:34:39.708 --> 01:34:44.082
Where are we now? Call it out.
- Massachusetts Avenue.

01:34:44.166 --> 01:34:48.249
Take it.
- I thought, to begin with,

01:34:48.333 --> 01:34:51.874
you might tell me how you're feeling.
- About what?

01:34:51.958 --> 01:34:56.040
The masters you serve and how they've
treated you. Your career,

01:34:56.125 --> 01:35:00.457
such as it is. Your life, Clarice.
- I thought we might talk about yours.

01:35:01.083 --> 01:35:04.665
What's the next cross street?
- Capitol Street.

01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:09.457
In 2 blocks make a left into
Union Station. Park.

01:35:09.541 --> 01:35:13.624
My life? What is there say about mine?
I have been in a state of hibernation

01:35:13.708 --> 01:35:18.624
for some time. A little inactive.
But now I'm back home.

01:35:19.666 --> 01:35:24.249
I'm very happy and very healthy.
You, though,

01:35:24.333 --> 01:35:27.915
it's you I'm worried about.
- I'm fine.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:31.915
No, you're certainly not fine.
You fell in love with the Bureau,

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:36.124
the institution, only to discover,
after giving it everything you've got

01:35:36.208 --> 01:35:40.290
that it does not love you back. That,
in fact, it resents you. Resents you

01:35:40.375 --> 01:35:44.915
more than the husband and children you
gave up to it. Why is that,

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:48.540
do you think? Why are you so resented?
- Tell me.

01:35:49.625 --> 01:35:53.624
Tell you? God bless you.
Well, isn't it clear?

01:35:55.458 --> 01:35:59.665
You serve the idea of order,
Clarice. They don't.

01:36:00.958 --> 01:36:05.457
You believe in the oath you took.
They don't. You feel it is your duty

01:36:05.541 --> 01:36:09.624
to protect the sheep. They don't.
They don't like you because

01:36:09.708 --> 01:36:13.832
you're not like them. They hate you
and they envy you. They're weak and

01:36:13.916 --> 01:36:18.624
unruly and believe in nothing.
- Mason Verger wants to kill you.

01:36:18.708 --> 01:36:23.082
Turn yourself in to me,
and I promise no one will hurt you.

01:36:23.166 --> 01:36:27.249
Will you stay with me in my prison
cell and hold my hand, Clarice?

01:36:27.333 --> 01:36:31.165
We could have some fun. No, Verger
doesn’t want to kill me any more than

01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:35.874
I want to kill him. He just wants to
see me suffer in an unimaginable way.

01:36:35.958 --> 01:36:40.082
He is rather twisted, you know. Have
you had the pleasure of meeting him?

01:36:40.166 --> 01:36:43.290
I have.
- Face to face, so to speak?

01:36:43.375 --> 01:36:46.707
Yes.
- Attractive, isn't he?

01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:50.874
Doctor Lecter? Doctor Lecter?

01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:57.165
Okay, back to you. I want to know what
it is you think you will do now that

01:36:57.583 --> 01:37:01.165
everything in the world you've ever
cared about has been taken from you.

01:37:01.250 --> 01:37:04.915
I don't know, Doctor Lecter.
- Tell me, Clarice. Do you think

01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.332
you'll work as a chambermaid
at a motel on Route 66,

01:37:09.416 --> 01:37:12.499
just like your mommy?

01:37:21.375 --> 01:37:26.332
What do you think now? Are you paying
attention to me, ex-Special Agent?

01:37:27.791 --> 01:37:32.457
Are you, by any chance, trying
to trace my whereabouts?

01:37:35.708 --> 01:37:39.249
I'm being followed, Doctor Lecter.
- I know. I've seen them.

01:37:39.333 --> 01:37:43.415
And now you're in a real dilemma,
aren't you? Do you continue to try

01:37:43.500 --> 01:37:47.332
to find me, knowing that you're
leading them to me?

01:37:47.416 --> 01:37:51.499
Do you have so much faith in your
abilities that you believe you

01:37:51.583 --> 01:37:56.332
could somehow simultaneously arrest
me and them? It could get very messy.

01:37:56.416 --> 01:37:59.499
Like the fish market. Hey, Clarice.
- Yeah?

01:37:59.583 --> 01:38:02.624
What if I did it for you?
- Did what?

01:38:02.708 --> 01:38:07.290
Harmed them, Clarice.
The ones who have harmed you.

01:38:07.375 --> 01:38:11.124
What if I made them scream apologies?
No, I shouldn't even say it,

01:38:11.208 --> 01:38:15.290
because you'll feel, with your perfect
grasp of right and wrong,

01:38:15.375 --> 01:38:19.874
that you were somehow accompli.
- Don't help me.

01:38:20.333 --> 01:38:25.082
No of course not.
Forget I said it.

01:38:25.291 --> 01:38:27.374
Pier.

01:38:28.041 --> 01:38:32.374
Clarice, you were very, very warm.
You were so close.

01:38:36.958 --> 01:38:41.290
But now you're getting colder again.
Yeah warmer again.

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:46.374
Well, I think I've been generous
enough with you, and the clues.

01:38:46.458 --> 01:38:50.665
You're on your own now, Clarice.
- Doctor Lecter?

01:38:59.750 --> 01:39:03.165
Hope you like them, Clarice.
Ta-ta.

01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:11.415
Va bene.

01:39:50.166 --> 01:39:53.249
Get out of the way!

01:40:04.041 --> 01:40:08.124
I know the first thing an hysteric
says is, I am not an hysteric,

01:40:08.208 --> 01:40:12.874
but I am not an hysteric. I'm calm.
- I'll ask you one time. Think good.

01:40:14.166 --> 01:40:19.249
Think about every good thing you ever
did. Think about what you swore.

01:40:19.875 --> 01:40:23.957
Two men in a van. A third driving.
Another man down. They put him in the

01:40:24.041 --> 01:40:28.124
back. I think it was Lecter. I've
given you the license plate, and I'm

01:40:28.208 --> 01:40:32.749
reporting it all to you again.
- All right.

01:40:33.333 --> 01:40:37.540
I'll go with it as a kidnapping.
I'll send someone out with,

01:40:37.625 --> 01:40:42.165
if he'll let us on the property.
- I should go, too. Deputize me.

01:40:42.375 --> 01:40:45.999
No. You're not going.
You're going home

01:40:46.083 --> 01:40:50.457
where you'll wait for me to call and
tell you what, if anything, we found.

01:40:52.666 --> 01:40:57.790
Thank Mr. Verger for look around.
- He's always happy to see you.

01:41:08.291 --> 01:41:12.082
Phone.
- What number, please?

01:41:12.166 --> 01:41:13.749
Carlo.

01:41:18.208 --> 01:41:20.457
Pier.

01:41:27.041 --> 01:41:29.040
Hello?
- How is he?

01:41:29.125 --> 01:41:32.957
Uh, sleeping.
- Bring him home.

01:41:56.208 --> 01:41:59.915
You've reached Clarice Starling.
Please leave a message.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:03.832
Pick up, Starling. There was nothing
out there. I'm gonna say it again,

01:42:03.916 --> 01:42:07.915
in case you didn't hear me clearly:
You are not a law officer while you're

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:12.749
on suspension. You're Joe Blow.
I hope, you're in the bathroom.

01:42:52.958 --> 01:42:56.499
Hylochoerus Meinertzhageni.

01:42:58.166 --> 01:43:02.332
Ring any bells from high
school biology, Doctor?

01:43:03.208 --> 01:43:06.915
No? Well, I could list its most
conspicuous features,

01:43:08.833 --> 01:43:13.832
if that would help jog the memory.
Three pairs of incisors,

01:43:15.541 --> 01:43:20.457
one pair of elongated canines,

01:43:21.625 --> 01:43:25.749
three pairs of molars,
four pairs of pre-molars,

01:43:27.708 --> 01:43:31.332
upper and lower,
for a total of forty-four teeth.

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:43.207
The meal will begin with an
hors d'oeuvre tartare.

01:43:45.666 --> 01:43:48.749
Your feet.

01:43:48.833 --> 01:43:53.582
The main course, the rest of you,
won't be served until 7 hours later.

01:43:54.750 --> 01:43:58.540
But during that time
you'll be able to enjoy the effects

01:43:58.625 --> 01:44:02.374
of the consumed appetizer with a

01:44:02.458 --> 01:44:06.040
full-bodied saline drip.

01:44:06.125 --> 01:44:09.707
I guess you wish now you'd,

01:44:09.791 --> 01:44:14.124
you'd fed the rest of me to the dogs.

01:44:14.208 --> 01:44:17.749
No, Mason. No, I much prefer
you the way you are.

01:44:20.625 --> 01:44:23.999
So, dinner at eight.

01:44:53.750 --> 01:44:58.374
You will stay for the evening's
entertainment, won't you, Cordell?

01:44:59.166 --> 01:45:03.332
If it's all right with you
I think I'd rather not.

01:45:04.166 --> 01:45:08.207
Rather not or will not?

01:47:13.458 --> 01:47:17.957
Your little brother must smell
almost as badly as you do by now.

01:47:44.875 --> 01:47:48.749
Hold it! Hands where I can see 'em!
- Si.

01:47:52.083 --> 01:47:54.999
Quiet!
- Si. Vai!

01:47:59.375 --> 01:48:02.749
What was that? Cordell, quickly!

01:48:02.958 --> 01:48:07.749
Down on your stomach!
- Good evening, Clarice.

01:48:07.833 --> 01:48:12.124
It's just like old times.
- Shut up.

01:48:12.750 --> 01:48:17.707
Can you walk?
- I can try.

01:48:18.375 --> 01:48:21.790
You look well.
- I'm gonna cut you loose.

01:48:21.875 --> 01:48:25.749
If you touch me, I'll shoot you.
- Understood.

01:48:25.833 --> 01:48:29.915
Do right and you'll live through this.
- Spoken like a true Protestant.

01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.040
Better hurry. This might go faster if
you hand me the knife.

01:48:37.208 --> 01:48:41.749
There was a third in the loft.
Behind me.

01:49:17.916 --> 01:49:21.957
Cordell! Get the gun and shoot him!
- Go into the pen?

01:49:22.583 --> 01:49:25.624
Yes!
- No. I'm staying out of this.

01:49:25.708 --> 01:49:29.790
You're involved is what you are,
in all of it. Now do it!

01:49:29.875 --> 01:49:31.874
No.
- Yes!

01:49:31.958 --> 01:49:36.499
Hey, Cordell! Why don't you push
him in? You can always say it was me.

01:49:43.250 --> 01:49:45.332
Cordell?

01:49:46.333 --> 01:49:49.624
Cordell? Cordell! Cordell!

01:51:24.416 --> 01:51:28.332
I'll be at my lake house all weekend.
Don't want any calls forwarded either,

01:51:28.416 --> 01:51:31.999
you understand? Whoever it is,
they can all wait, okay?

01:51:32.083 --> 01:51:35.665
Mary, listen, it's Fourth of July,
for Christ's sakes. Thank you.

01:51:53.708 --> 01:51:56.499
What the fuck?

01:52:05.666 --> 01:52:08.749
Good, you brought the wine.
- Oh, God! Oh!

01:54:26.250 --> 01:54:30.249
Yeah, we've traced your call and units
will be there in about ten minutes.

01:54:30.333 --> 01:54:34.957
If you can do it safely,
then just get out of the house.

01:54:35.083 --> 01:54:38.624
Otherwise, stay on the phone with me.
Ma'am? Are you there?

01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:07.249
Are those shallots?
- Mm-hm. And caper berries.

01:55:11.958 --> 01:55:16.540
Ah. That butter smells wonderful.
- Mm-hm. You feeling hungry, Paul?

01:55:17.583 --> 01:55:19.749
Very.

01:55:24.541 --> 01:55:28.832
What's the main course?
- Ah you should never ask.

01:55:28.916 --> 01:55:32.749
It spoils the surprise.
Clarice, what are you doing up?

01:55:32.833 --> 01:55:37.457
You should be resting. Back to bed.
- I'm hungry.

01:55:40.166 --> 01:55:43.957
Hello, Paul.
- Paul, don't be rude.

01:55:44.041 --> 01:55:48.207
Say, "Hello, Agent Starling."
- Hello, Agent Starling.

01:55:52.791 --> 01:55:57.582
I always wanted to watch you eat.
- What have you got in your hand?

01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:02.790
Something to bash me over the head
with? Put it on the table.

01:56:03.583 --> 01:56:06.624
Good girl.
- Hey, that's mine.

01:56:06.708 --> 01:56:09.207
Now sit down.

01:56:11.041 --> 01:56:15.290
Hey, Clarice. I love the dress.
It's beautiful.

01:56:16.125 --> 01:56:19.624
What do you think, Paul?
- Nice. Nice.

01:56:29.333 --> 01:56:32.915
Why don't you say grace, Paul?

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:35.124
Me?
- Yeah.

01:56:35.208 --> 01:56:37.999
Grace?
- Sure.

01:56:38.083 --> 01:56:41.332
Okay. Bow your head.

01:56:44.291 --> 01:56:48.457
Father, we thank Thee for Thy
blessings and dedicate them to

01:56:48.541 --> 01:56:52.957
Thy mercy we are about to receive.
Forgive us all, even white trash

01:56:54.125 --> 01:56:58.499
like Starling here
and bring her into my service.

01:56:58.583 --> 01:57:00.707
Amen.

01:57:01.625 --> 01:57:05.915
Now I have to tell you, Paul, even the
Apostle Paul couldn't have do better.

01:57:06.000 --> 01:57:09.624
He hated women, too.
- May I have some wine, please?

01:57:09.708 --> 01:57:14.249
No good idea. Not with the morphine.
Better you should eat some broth.

01:57:15.625 --> 01:57:20.040
By the way, Starling, that was a job
offering I worked into the blessing.

01:57:21.041 --> 01:57:24.624
I'm going to Congress, you know.
- Are you?

01:57:24.708 --> 01:57:29.457
Come around campaign headquarters.
You could be a office girl!

01:57:29.875 --> 01:57:33.957
Can you type and file?
Can you take dictation?

01:57:34.041 --> 01:57:37.749
Take this down:
Washington is full of corn-pone

01:57:37.833 --> 01:57:42.332
country pussy.
- I took it down.

01:57:42.416 --> 01:57:46.540
You said it already.
- Paul, now you're being rude.

01:57:46.625 --> 01:57:50.582
And I hate rude people. Drink your
broth like a good boy.

01:57:50.666 --> 01:57:54.332
Come on. Sip.
Good.

01:57:57.375 --> 01:58:01.457
Ugh. It's not very good, buddy.
- I admit I added something to yours.

01:58:01.541 --> 01:58:05.874
It's clashing with the cumin. But I
assure you, the next is to die for.

01:58:17.250 --> 01:58:20.290
Ah, ah, ah! Come on, Clarice.
- No.

01:58:20.375 --> 01:58:23.499
That's a good girl. Good.

01:58:56.625 --> 01:59:00.707
You see, the brain itself feels no
pain, Clarice, if that concerns you.

01:59:00.791 --> 01:59:04.874
For example, Paul won't miss this
little piece here, which is the part

01:59:04.958 --> 01:59:09.332
of the prefrontal lobe which they
say is the seat of good manners.

01:59:09.583 --> 01:59:14.665
Your profile at the border stations
has five features. I'll trade you.

01:59:15.250 --> 01:59:17.249
Trade?
- Stop...

01:59:17.333 --> 01:59:21.415
How does that word taste to you?
Cheap and metallic

01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:25.290
like sucking on a greasy coin?
- Who's Clarice?

01:59:25.375 --> 01:59:29.582
Agent Starling. If you can't keep up
with the dialog, don't try to join.

01:59:29.666 --> 01:59:33.832
Me, me, Paul. I'm Starling.
- See.

01:59:34.500 --> 01:59:38.665
Here, right here is the sac
that contains the brain.

01:59:42.916 --> 01:59:46.957
I would really like some wine!

01:59:48.666 --> 01:59:52.832
That smells great.
- Yes. Why don't you try a piece?

01:59:53.791 --> 01:59:57.790
I would really like some wine.

01:59:59.125 --> 02:00:03.415
It is good.
- All right. But just a little.

02:00:07.041 --> 02:00:09.665
Okay? No?

02:00:25.291 --> 02:00:29.374
Given the chance, you would deny
me my life, wouldn't you?

02:00:29.458 --> 02:00:33.790
Not your life.
- My freedom. You'd take that from me.

02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:38.249
And if you did, would they have
you back, do you think? The F.B.I.?

02:00:40.375 --> 02:00:44.582
Those people you despise almost
as much as they despise you?

02:00:44.666 --> 02:00:48.582
Would they give you a medal? Would you
have it professionally framed

02:00:48.666 --> 02:00:52.749
and hang it on your wall to look at
and remind you of your

02:00:52.833 --> 02:00:56.749
courage and incorruptibility?

02:00:57.708 --> 02:01:01.832
All you would need for that,
Clarice, is a mirror.

02:01:02.708 --> 02:01:07.040
I had plans for that smart mouth,
but I'm never gonna hire her, you now.

02:01:07.625 --> 02:01:10.249
Paul?
- Paul?

02:01:12.125 --> 02:01:16.207
Remember what I said?
If you can't be polite to our guests

02:01:16.291 --> 02:01:20.582
you have to sit at the kiddies' table.

02:01:20.750 --> 02:01:25.415
Don't get up, Clarice.
Paul will help me clear

02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:29.957
and make the coffee.
Just think about what I said, Clarice.

02:01:33.291 --> 02:01:35.707
Coffee.

02:02:12.583 --> 02:02:16.915
I came halfway around the world
to watch you run, Clarice.

02:02:20.083 --> 02:02:23.624
Let me run, huh?

02:02:41.375 --> 02:02:45.707
Tell me, Clarice
would you ever say to me,

02:02:45.791 --> 02:02:50.249
Stop? If you love me, you'd stop?

02:02:51.416 --> 02:02:58.040
Not in a thousand years.

02:03:02.541 --> 02:03:05.874
That's my girl.

02:03:18.416 --> 02:03:22.999
Now that's really interesting,
Clarice. I'm really pressed for time

02:03:24.375 --> 02:03:27.749
so where's the key?

02:03:27.958 --> 02:03:31.332
Where's the key?

02:03:35.750 --> 02:03:38.165
Okay.

02:03:42.541 --> 02:03:46.540
Above or below the wrist, Clarice?

02:03:54.791 --> 02:03:57.957
This is really gonna hurt.

02:04:46.208 --> 02:04:49.124
Show me your hands!

02:04:49.208 --> 02:04:53.332
Identify yourself!
- I'm Clarice Starling! F.B.I.!

02:05:55.375 --> 02:05:58.790
Hi.
- Hi. What's that?

02:06:00.708 --> 02:06:04.457
Oh, that's caviar.
- What are those?

02:06:05.125 --> 02:06:09.082
These are figs.
- And that?

02:06:09.166 --> 02:06:11.290
And this?

02:06:13.583 --> 02:06:17.457
Oh, that I don't think you would like.
- It looks good.

02:06:17.541 --> 02:06:21.124
Oh, it is good.
- Can I have some?

02:06:21.708 --> 02:06:25.915
You're a very unusual boy, aren't you?
- I couldn't eat what they gave me.

02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:30.082
Nor should you. It isn't even food
as I understand the definition.

02:06:30.166 --> 02:06:33.749
Which is why I always bring my own.

02:06:33.833 --> 02:06:37.332
So which would you like to try?

02:06:37.750 --> 02:06:40.040
Aha.

02:06:40.125 --> 02:06:43.624
Well, I suppose it's all right.

02:06:45.208 --> 02:06:49.624
After all, as your mother tells you,
and my mother certainly told me,

02:06:49.708 --> 02:06:53.874
It is important, she always used to
say, always to try new things.

02:06:55.291 --> 02:06:57.374
Open up.
