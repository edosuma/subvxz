00:19.950 --> 00:22.372
And Howard Cosell...
I swear this is true...

00:22.378 --> 00:25.355
without missing a beat, drops his pants,

00:25.388 --> 00:28.392
points to his pubes and says,
"Tug away, my friend."

00:29.351 --> 00:32.262
And...
And my God, the bush that that man had.

00:32.296 --> 00:33.765
No, no, no.

00:33.797 --> 00:35.198
It looked like he was tryin' to smuggle

00:35.232 --> 00:37.969
one of the Jackson 5 down
there between his legs.

00:38.002 --> 00:39.971
I-I think it was Tito.

00:41.906 --> 00:44.241
But that heart-warming tale

00:44.274 --> 00:47.378
is what is so special about
Mack & McGraw, isn't it?

00:47.410 --> 00:48.546
I mean, for one night a year,

00:48.578 --> 00:51.616
we get to walk amongst baseball legends.

00:51.663 --> 00:54.152
But enough about the past.

00:54.185 --> 00:56.220
Let's focus on gettin'
drunk in the present, shall we?

00:58.289 --> 01:00.992
So, quick announcement... seriously.

01:01.024 --> 01:04.162
Guys,
no pissin' in the corners this year.

01:04.194 --> 01:05.587
I'm serious.

01:05.634 --> 01:09.166
No, if you can't make it to the
bathroom, please wear a diaper.

01:10.500 --> 01:13.003
I am lookin' at you, Brent Musburger.

01:20.911 --> 01:22.313
Hey, fellas.

01:22.345 --> 01:24.381
Can I get a second with him, please?

01:24.414 --> 01:24.829
Get up.

01:24.899 --> 01:28.352
Hey, you don't have to go just
'cause he says so.

01:28.385 --> 01:30.121
Hi, Joe Buck.

01:30.153 --> 01:33.223
Listen, did you lie to Robbie Butler

01:33.257 --> 01:36.326
and tell him that I wear
non-prescription glasses

01:36.360 --> 01:37.929
to seem smart?

01:37.962 --> 01:40.364
I... Joe Buck,
it's nothing personal, all right?

01:40.397 --> 01:42.563
I just happen to hate your stupid face.

01:42.633 --> 01:45.041
You were a groomsman at my wedding.

01:45.143 --> 01:46.645
Look, Joe.

01:46.679 --> 01:48.181
It's not just that you became

01:48.214 --> 01:50.684
the biggest broadcaster in America.

01:52.919 --> 01:54.721
Actually, yes, it is. That's it.

01:54.753 --> 01:55.854
Jesus, Jim.

01:55.887 --> 01:56.855
How was I supposed to know

01:56.888 --> 01:59.759
I was gonna plateau at age 24?

01:59.792 --> 02:01.928
Oh, come on. I guess, what?

02:01.961 --> 02:04.563
Like, your grass probably isn't as green

02:04.596 --> 02:06.265
as I imagine, though, right?

02:06.298 --> 02:09.535
No, life's pretty fantastic.

02:09.568 --> 02:10.737
And it's weird.

02:10.770 --> 02:12.539
I'm so famous right now

02:12.572 --> 02:16.076
that I pretty much just think
about something, and it appears.

02:18.310 --> 02:19.745
Who was that?

02:19.779 --> 02:21.146
Who was what?

02:21.179 --> 02:22.916
Great. Thanks for comin' by.

02:22.949 --> 02:24.217
Mission accomplished.

02:24.250 --> 02:25.751
I feel stupid and weak and vulnerable.

02:25.785 --> 02:28.221
Listen to me. Listen to me.
Look in my eyes.

02:28.253 --> 02:32.758
Now that I know what's wrong,
I think I can fix it.

02:32.792 --> 02:34.193
How you gonna do that?

02:34.226 --> 02:36.162
I don't want to oversell this, okay?

02:36.194 --> 02:37.563
But let's just say that by the time

02:37.597 --> 02:40.667
you get back to your
hotel room tonight...

02:40.699 --> 02:43.769
you may have a big
surprise waiting for you.

02:59.217 --> 03:02.187
Ooh.

03:08.627 --> 03:12.197
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck!

03:12.230 --> 03:14.667
Joe Buck!

03:14.699 --> 03:16.669
Ohh, fuck his ass.

03:25.311 --> 03:27.280
Joe Buck didn't shit in your bed.

03:27.312 --> 03:28.815
That was Musburger.

03:28.847 --> 03:31.351
Musbur... get outta here. Musburger.

03:31.383 --> 03:33.352
It was payback for that diaper joke.

03:33.385 --> 03:35.087
He always brags about it.

03:35.121 --> 03:37.357
Says it was the shit of his life.

03:37.389 --> 03:40.759
You know, that's actually pretty
funny comin' from Musburger.

03:40.793 --> 03:42.629
What the hell was the big surprise

03:42.662 --> 03:44.197
that Joe Buck was talkin' about, then?

03:44.229 --> 03:45.864
His producer was supposed to call

03:45.898 --> 03:47.066
and offer you the chance to fill in

03:47.098 --> 03:51.370
on the number-one broadcast
crew when Buck left for football.

03:51.404 --> 03:52.627
Your phone didn't ring?

03:52.784 --> 03:53.510
I don't know.

03:53.541 --> 03:56.021
I ran the hell out of
there to go kill Joe Buck!

03:56.053 --> 03:58.416
So, your life would have
been completely different

03:58.463 --> 04:01.058
had Musburger just had a smaller dinner.

04:01.092 --> 04:03.595
All right, look,
Joe Buck asked me to come out here

04:03.628 --> 04:06.131
to invite you to join him for
this year's Mack & McGraw.

04:06.164 --> 04:07.933
And I think you should do it.

04:07.966 --> 04:10.534
Well, Robbie, I'll think about it.

04:10.568 --> 04:13.538
And I do want to thank you for comin'.

04:13.570 --> 04:15.940
And you know, I want you to know...

04:15.974 --> 04:18.041
I think I learned a lot
about gender and sexuality

04:18.076 --> 04:19.077
over the years.

04:19.110 --> 04:21.178
No, I have. And I...

04:21.212 --> 04:22.714
I think I'm a lot more sensitive

04:22.747 --> 04:23.949
to what you were going
through back then.

04:23.981 --> 04:25.550
What are you doin'?

04:25.582 --> 04:26.651
I'm just tryin' to connect with you,
is all.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.118
- Hey, Jim.
- Just stop.

04:28.152 --> 04:29.521
- Let go of his hand.
- Come on.

04:29.553 --> 04:30.821
He doesn't really want to hold hands.

04:30.855 --> 04:31.990
- No, it's all right.
- Get away from me.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.157
Jim, he doesn't want to hold hands!

04:33.190 --> 04:34.593
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

04:34.626 --> 04:35.827
Look, I'm glad you're doin' better.

04:35.860 --> 04:39.230
All right, but you did sucker punch me.

04:39.264 --> 04:40.732
Mouth or stomach?

04:40.764 --> 04:42.099
Well, I make a living with this mouth.

04:42.132 --> 04:43.968
Yeah... Ohh!

04:45.569 --> 04:47.571
Hope to see you in Chicago, Jim.

04:47.605 --> 04:50.675
You're a good man, Robbie Butler.

04:52.143 --> 04:55.881
You... you guys have a pretty
complicated friendship.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.704
Come on, it's the perfect
time to take a vacation.

05:01.736 --> 05:03.371
Team's on a road trip.

05:03.405 --> 05:05.006
I'm almost paid off on my loan.

05:05.039 --> 05:07.008
We have money for travel and booze.

05:07.042 --> 05:08.643
Drinks are free at Mack & McGraw,

05:08.676 --> 05:10.044
but I do not want to go.

05:10.078 --> 05:11.347
When you were suicidal,

05:11.380 --> 05:12.581
the only thing that
convinced you to live

05:12.614 --> 05:14.215
was my promise of free booze.

05:14.248 --> 05:16.318
You said that if hell had an open bar,
you'd shake...

05:16.351 --> 05:17.553
- Satan's hand.
- Satan's hand, I know.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.121
Yeah, so what is going on?

05:19.154 --> 05:21.123
What's goin' on is I'm ashamed,
all right?

05:21.155 --> 05:23.324
This is gonna be like
my high-school reunion.

05:23.357 --> 05:26.427
Only instead of getting fat and bald,
I ended up here.

05:26.460 --> 05:28.062
What is so wrong with this place?

05:28.095 --> 05:29.597
Please don't look at Dale right now.

05:29.630 --> 05:32.301
Just don't... no. Don't!

05:32.333 --> 05:35.470
This stain's old.
You can go ahead and serve me.

05:37.339 --> 05:41.142
Look, I'm ashamed of what I have become,
all right?

05:41.176 --> 05:42.745
I used to be one of the greats.

05:42.777 --> 05:45.213
I was a pillar of
Midwestern American values,

05:45.246 --> 05:47.116
and now I'm... I'm some kind of clown

05:47.149 --> 05:48.718
that gets drunk on the Internet.

05:50.818 --> 05:52.253
Look at me.

05:52.287 --> 05:53.621
I'm with you every day.

05:53.655 --> 05:56.157
You have nothing to be ashamed of...

05:56.191 --> 05:57.626
other than your toenail situation,

05:57.659 --> 05:59.028
which we've discussed.

05:59.061 --> 06:01.063
- I-I don't know what that is.
- It's fungus.

06:01.095 --> 06:03.331
- Yeah, but is it, though?
- Yes, yeah.

06:03.364 --> 06:05.633
If you're not gonna do it for you,
do it for us.

06:05.667 --> 06:07.602
It'll be our first vacation together.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.304
We just got back from Pittsburgh.

06:09.337 --> 06:12.341
Going to Pittsburgh to get
an abortion doesn't count.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.777
All right, that's a fair point.

06:14.809 --> 06:17.345
All right, what the hell?
Let's go to Chicago.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.515
But just so we can have the kind of sex

06:19.547 --> 06:22.517
that is only possible when
somebody else cleans the sheets.

06:22.551 --> 06:24.053
It is the best kind.

06:24.085 --> 06:26.722
Oh, it is.

06:26.755 --> 06:28.791
Here are the stadium keys.

06:30.125 --> 06:31.827
Your only job... literally,

06:31.859 --> 06:34.095
the only thing you have to do

06:34.128 --> 06:35.797
is make sure it doesn't burn down.

06:35.830 --> 06:37.832
Okay. You know, this means a lot to me.

06:37.866 --> 06:39.801
Not a lot of people
will put this much power

06:39.835 --> 06:41.203
in the hands of a teenager.

06:41.236 --> 06:42.570
Yeah, well, don't pull a muscle

06:42.604 --> 06:44.640
givin'
yourself a pat on the back or anything.

06:44.672 --> 06:47.308
She just doesn't think you have
enough friends to throw a party.

06:47.342 --> 06:49.277
Well, maybe the old Charles.

06:49.311 --> 06:50.846
But you're looking at the producer

06:50.878 --> 06:53.782
of a top-10 podcast on iTunes Charles.

06:53.815 --> 06:56.485
This is the Charles who
spent the past four months

06:56.517 --> 06:58.486
locked in a room with that egomaniac

06:58.520 --> 07:00.688
just soaking up
confidence like a sponge.

07:00.722 --> 07:02.558
I'm not going to throw a party,

07:02.590 --> 07:05.660
but if I did, it would be lit.

07:05.693 --> 07:07.662
I believe you.

07:07.695 --> 07:10.131
You should.

07:10.164 --> 07:11.599
No, she doesn't.

07:15.436 --> 07:17.372
Ladies and gentlemen...

07:19.573 --> 07:21.210
Titties.

07:21.243 --> 07:23.112
Titties and titties.

07:23.145 --> 07:25.714
Titties plus titties equals...

07:25.746 --> 07:26.848
titties.

07:34.900 --> 07:37.703
All right, wait, just... one second.

07:39.498 --> 07:41.066
I've never seen you so nervous.

07:41.831 --> 07:43.651
I... you know.

07:43.800 --> 07:46.303
What if these guys don't like
who I am now or somethin'?

07:46.336 --> 07:47.871
Or even worse... what if they

07:47.904 --> 07:49.406
just don't give a shit
that I'm even here?

07:49.438 --> 07:52.308
If anyone is mean to you,
I will grab a sharp object

07:52.341 --> 07:54.377
and... and stab them till they stop.

07:54.411 --> 07:56.980
Well, that sounds like a good plan.

07:58.748 --> 07:59.882
You're gonna be great.

07:59.916 --> 08:00.851
All right, ready?

08:00.884 --> 08:02.186
Ready.

08:04.086 --> 08:05.421
Don't really stab anybody.

08:05.454 --> 08:06.724
Okay.

08:07.824 --> 08:10.327
- Oh.
- Hey!

08:12.161 --> 08:13.329
Hey.

08:13.363 --> 08:15.466
Brian Kenny, get outta here!

08:15.498 --> 08:16.799
Good to see you.

08:16.832 --> 08:18.202
Jim, great to see you.

08:18.235 --> 08:19.903
You too. I don't know who you are,

08:19.935 --> 08:21.104
but it's great to see you.

08:21.137 --> 08:22.205
We've met five times, but it's okay.

08:22.238 --> 08:23.906
Robbie Butler, give me a break.

08:23.940 --> 08:25.375
- Good to see you. All right.
- Jim.

08:25.408 --> 08:26.777
Tim Kurkjian, how are you?

08:26.810 --> 08:28.011
- Good to see you.
- You good?

08:28.043 --> 08:29.746
Hey!

08:37.285 --> 08:38.488
It's Joe Buck.

08:38.522 --> 08:40.155
What took you so long?

08:40.190 --> 08:45.129
Uh, sorry,
I got held up finger-blasting your mom.

08:47.163 --> 08:49.199
My mom's dead.

08:49.231 --> 08:53.336
Well,
no wonder it took her so long to finish.

08:56.940 --> 08:58.275
Come here, you old buckeye.

08:58.307 --> 09:00.042
You smell like shit!

09:03.879 --> 09:04.981
I love you, though.

09:05.015 --> 09:07.518
I missed this guy.

09:07.550 --> 09:09.386
I missed all of ya.

09:16.926 --> 09:19.061
Oh, my!

09:19.094 --> 09:21.397
You and Jerry Reinsdorf
are gonna be neck and neck

09:21.430 --> 09:23.400
for the title of most attractive owner.

09:25.301 --> 09:26.903
Okay, what time's dinner?

09:26.936 --> 09:29.238
Whoa, whoa, whoa, oh.

09:29.272 --> 09:32.175
It's a tradition that
women aren't allowed

09:32.209 --> 09:34.277
into this event until after dinner.

09:34.310 --> 09:36.213
What? These guys' wives, they don't eat?

09:36.246 --> 09:38.048
There are no wives at Mack & McGraw.

09:38.080 --> 09:40.416
Back in the day,
we called after dinner Whores' Hour.

09:40.449 --> 09:41.819
What do you call it now?

09:41.852 --> 09:43.153
Whores' Hour.

09:43.185 --> 09:45.555
But we just... we...
we tend to whisper that now.

09:45.589 --> 09:48.223
I was real excited to talk
baseball with Brian Kenny.

09:48.257 --> 09:50.960
I tried to last night,
but Charlie Steiner cornered me

09:50.993 --> 09:53.262
and kept showing me
pictures of his three pugs.

09:53.296 --> 09:55.398
Jesus, really?

09:55.431 --> 09:58.435
Anyway, how's this for a compromise,
all right?

09:58.468 --> 09:59.937
Don't do me any favors.

09:59.969 --> 10:01.571
You meet me after
dinner at Mack & McGraw,

10:01.604 --> 10:04.841
and in the meantime,
you can use this ticket to today's

10:04.874 --> 10:06.309
♪ Cubs game ♪

10:06.343 --> 10:07.911
- What?!
- Yep.

10:07.944 --> 10:09.079
No, you didn't!

10:09.112 --> 10:10.914
Are you for real?

10:12.315 --> 10:13.850
I've never been to Wrigley!

10:13.883 --> 10:14.917
I'm aware of that.

10:14.950 --> 10:16.586
Holy shit.

10:18.054 --> 10:19.022
Thank you, Jim.

10:19.055 --> 10:20.590
You are welcome.

10:20.623 --> 10:24.460
When you used to come to Chicago
by yourself back in the day,

10:24.493 --> 10:28.931
did you... partake in Whores' Hour?

10:28.964 --> 10:30.166
No, I did not.

10:30.199 --> 10:30.968
Come on.

10:31.001 --> 10:33.036
Jules, at the time of my divorce,

10:33.069 --> 10:35.339
Lucy was the only woman
that I had ever slept with.

10:35.372 --> 10:36.607
Dear God!

10:38.108 --> 10:40.176
Are you biggest cuckold of all time?

10:40.209 --> 10:41.478
I think without a doubt I am.

10:41.511 --> 10:43.113
You know, there's a whole subgenre

10:43.146 --> 10:44.180
of porn devoted to this.

10:44.214 --> 10:45.449
You know that, right?

10:45.482 --> 10:46.949
Guys dress up as me

10:46.983 --> 10:49.353
and then watch other
men plow their wives.

10:49.386 --> 10:50.621
Yeah, Cuckmire, I've seen it.

10:50.653 --> 10:52.488
Cuckmire.

10:52.522 --> 10:54.090
I wasn't aware it was called Cuckmire.

10:54.123 --> 10:56.259
That's fine.

10:56.292 --> 10:58.227
You know, for the longest time,
I just...

10:58.261 --> 11:00.964
I really hated who I became. I did.

11:00.997 --> 11:02.933
But now for the first
time in a long time,

11:02.965 --> 11:05.201
I feel like I can maybe
change back into who I was.

11:05.234 --> 11:08.938
And that is thanks to you.

11:08.972 --> 11:10.641
Wow.

11:10.674 --> 11:12.542
I can't believe your
Tinder bio was real.

11:12.574 --> 11:14.377
You actually own a
minor-league baseball team?

11:14.411 --> 11:16.979
Yeah. You know, this is just one of

11:17.012 --> 11:19.349
my many investments at the moment.

11:19.382 --> 11:21.417
How's your beer, by the way?

11:21.450 --> 11:24.387
Uh, warm and tastes kind of funny.

11:24.421 --> 11:26.256
Mm, yeah, I couldn't find any cups,

11:26.289 --> 11:28.492
so I just rinsed out a
few ranch containers.

11:28.525 --> 11:30.060
I see that.

11:30.093 --> 11:33.430
So, are you, uh... you from around here?

11:33.463 --> 11:35.165
Oh, no, I'm from Ohio.

11:35.198 --> 11:37.167
I'm with the theater camp
just right down the road.

11:37.199 --> 11:38.935
Mm, yeah. That makes sense

11:38.969 --> 11:42.472
'cause normally everybody
here already knows who I am.

11:42.504 --> 11:45.942
- 'Cause, um, you know Drake?
- Yeah.

11:45.975 --> 11:49.645
I'm pretty much what Drake is to Toronto

11:49.679 --> 11:51.048
but to Morristown.

11:51.080 --> 11:52.515
Wow.

11:52.549 --> 11:54.418
Hey, cheers.

12:02.714 --> 12:04.650
I got one. So, a few years ago,

12:04.682 --> 12:05.950
I'm doing the World Series.

12:05.984 --> 12:07.014
I'm worn out, middle of the night,

12:07.053 --> 12:09.955
phone rings,
and on the other end I hear slapping.

12:09.988 --> 12:13.659
And this drunken,
absurd voice comes on and goes,

12:13.691 --> 12:16.662
"That's the way my balls sound."

12:16.695 --> 12:18.363
Tell me that wad'n't you.

12:18.396 --> 12:19.865
Seriously, I have no recollection,

12:19.897 --> 12:22.401
but, you know,
I have a very serious drinkin' problem.

12:22.434 --> 12:23.869
Hey!

12:23.902 --> 12:26.205
Not kiddin', actually,
but cheers anyway.

12:26.238 --> 12:28.239
Yeah, these things have really
gone downhill since you left.

12:28.272 --> 12:31.442
Three years ago, Joe hosted.
He workshopped his one-man show.

12:31.475 --> 12:33.412
Listen to me... "Echoes of My Father"

12:33.445 --> 12:35.379
was a Time Out New York "Thing To Do,"

12:35.412 --> 12:37.416
so I resent any, uh, implication

12:37.449 --> 12:39.418
that a good time was not had by all.

12:39.450 --> 12:41.586
Is your new show called
"The Puffed-Up Twat"?

12:42.653 --> 12:44.288
Can you just go away again?

12:44.321 --> 12:45.823
I... please, I can't wait to see

12:45.856 --> 12:47.725
what y'all have on tap for this year.

12:47.758 --> 12:49.927
Oh, we got a fantastic
video tribute for you.

12:49.960 --> 12:52.263
- Oh!
- Jesus, Jonah, that was a surprise.

12:52.296 --> 12:53.699
Wait, what? How was I supposed to know?

12:53.731 --> 12:55.900
Really, a video tribute? Really?

12:55.934 --> 12:57.436
- Yeah.
- Guys, I'm touched.

12:57.469 --> 12:59.738
I am touched, but I do reserve the right

12:59.771 --> 13:01.540
to respond with a few words of my own.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.542
Well,
as long as you don't bust out a version

13:03.575 --> 13:04.876
of "Papa Can You Hear Me?"

13:04.908 --> 13:06.811
It was emotional,
and it made Kurkjian cry.

13:06.845 --> 13:08.312
Right or wrong?

13:08.345 --> 13:11.616
Uh, hey,
I found his sincerity compelling.

13:11.649 --> 13:14.318
Plus, I love lentil.

13:15.820 --> 13:16.955
You mean "Yentl."

13:16.988 --> 13:18.390
What's in this thing?

13:18.422 --> 13:20.926
Oh, I love all beans. Here's to beans!

13:20.959 --> 13:22.694
Beans! And Streisand.

13:22.726 --> 13:25.363
- Lentil!
- To Barbra Streisand.

13:33.071 --> 13:36.541
Yeah, I like a really
relaxed work environment.

13:36.574 --> 13:38.277
It's beautiful.

13:38.310 --> 13:39.777
Can I refill your beer?

13:39.811 --> 13:42.614
Can I have extra ranch
dressing in mine this time?

13:42.647 --> 13:43.782
Of course you can.

13:45.517 --> 13:48.487
Because their investing in contact

13:48.519 --> 13:50.354
throughout the lineup is so shrewd.

13:50.388 --> 13:51.790
In the high-velo era,

13:51.822 --> 13:53.758
the ability just to not strike out

13:53.792 --> 13:55.761
is in itself an undervalued asset.

13:55.793 --> 13:56.961
Wow.

13:56.994 --> 13:58.397
I have to say,

13:58.430 --> 14:00.032
I've enjoyed talking baseball with you

14:00.065 --> 14:01.499
more than any other escort

14:01.532 --> 14:03.368
who's ever come up to
me at these things.

14:03.401 --> 14:05.471
But I'm a married man.
Have a good night.

14:13.878 --> 14:17.748
Uh-oh. What? What's the matter?

14:17.782 --> 14:20.484
Well, for one thing,
Brian Kenny think I'm a prostitute.

14:20.518 --> 14:23.021
The Frackers lost at Slippery Rock.

14:23.053 --> 14:24.855
Cubs game was rained out, and...

14:24.888 --> 14:27.926
there's a whore wearing the
exact same dress I'm wearing.

14:27.959 --> 14:29.527
Shh. Darlin', shh, shh, shh!

14:29.561 --> 14:31.062
We say "sex worker" now.

14:32.964 --> 14:34.032
What are you doing?

14:34.065 --> 14:35.066
Oh, I'm just workin' on my speech.

14:35.099 --> 14:36.734
I usually go off the cuff,

14:36.768 --> 14:39.071
but I like to have a few
bullets loaded into the chamber.

14:39.104 --> 14:41.772
I got jokes on how many
times Olbermann's been fired.

14:41.806 --> 14:43.008
- Mm-hmm.
- A lot.

14:43.041 --> 14:45.180
How Rich Eisen went bald at 23.

14:45.230 --> 14:45.867
Mm-hmm.

14:45.914 --> 14:47.813
And how Chris Berman's neck

14:47.845 --> 14:49.914
is slowly but surely
swallowing his entire face.

14:49.947 --> 14:51.782
Oh, then for my closer,

14:51.816 --> 14:53.719
I'm gonna pull out my dick,

14:53.752 --> 14:55.787
put it on Brent Musburger's face,

14:55.820 --> 14:56.955
and say, "Oh, looks like

14:56.988 --> 14:58.724
somebody can finally grow a mustache."

15:00.591 --> 15:02.093
I don't get it.

15:02.127 --> 15:03.895
Well, look, everybody here knows

15:03.927 --> 15:06.097
that Musburger can't grow facial hair,
see.

15:06.130 --> 15:09.433
Plus, you know,
my dick will be on his face.

15:09.466 --> 15:10.936
How much have you had to drink?

15:10.969 --> 15:13.839
Well, it's free, so I don't know...
all of it?

15:13.872 --> 15:15.073
I...

15:15.105 --> 15:16.407
Please take your seats.

15:16.441 --> 15:18.410
The show is about to begin.

15:18.442 --> 15:20.711
Come on, darlin'.

15:23.447 --> 15:25.716
Thank you.

15:25.749 --> 15:28.619
Joe!

15:30.455 --> 15:34.493
Our friend Jim Brockmire
has been resurrected.

15:34.526 --> 15:36.828
And as with Lazarus of Bethany,

15:36.860 --> 15:39.697
there really is only one response

15:39.730 --> 15:41.799
to this incredible journey.

15:41.832 --> 15:43.067
Jesus wept.

15:44.636 --> 15:47.038
I now present our tribute film,

15:47.071 --> 15:50.508
"Jim Brockmire: Legend of the Booth."

15:52.176 --> 15:54.678
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

15:54.711 --> 15:57.982
My first memory of Jim Brockmire

15:58.016 --> 16:00.652
was just being completely jealous

16:00.685 --> 16:03.989
that he got to be the
youngest play-by-play man

16:04.022 --> 16:05.757
in baseball history.

16:05.790 --> 16:06.892
From the start there was something

16:06.925 --> 16:08.894
delightfully off about Jim.

16:08.926 --> 16:11.562
We would listen to the
feed of the game at ESPN,

16:11.595 --> 16:12.563
look at each other and go,

16:12.596 --> 16:14.131
"What the fuck did he just say?"

16:14.165 --> 16:17.202
Am I a cartoon cat who got hit
on the head with a soup can?

16:17.234 --> 16:19.704
Because I am seeing double...
double play!

16:19.737 --> 16:21.034
And that'll end the inning.

16:21.089 --> 16:24.675
And like a newly divorced dad's dinner,
Clark is frozen.

16:24.709 --> 16:26.210
Strike three, lookin'.

16:26.244 --> 16:28.013
Those Reds games were insane.

16:28.046 --> 16:30.047
Whenever Kansas City
would go to Cincinnati,

16:30.080 --> 16:32.183
Marty Brennaman would usually bring in

16:32.216 --> 16:33.818
some top-shelf bourbon.

16:33.851 --> 16:35.619
And Jim would get into
it during the game.

16:35.652 --> 16:37.656
Oh, man, I'm loose.

16:37.689 --> 16:39.758
It's like there's an electric blanket

16:39.791 --> 16:41.092
coursing through my veins.

16:42.926 --> 16:44.495
Uh, welcome back, folks.

16:44.528 --> 16:45.931
You snuck up on me there.

16:45.964 --> 16:47.998
Sorry about that, Kansas City.

16:48.032 --> 16:50.234
Well, eventually, he'd get buzzed enough

16:50.268 --> 16:53.238
that he'd start to bring out
"The Godfather" references.

16:53.271 --> 16:56.174
Beltran makes a diving stab. And oh!

16:56.206 --> 16:59.176
Look how they massacred my boy!

16:59.210 --> 17:00.612
Top of the third now...

17:00.644 --> 17:02.179
Oh, my God.

17:02.213 --> 17:04.082
What's the matter?

17:04.114 --> 17:06.784
I've always been like this.

17:06.817 --> 17:08.886
...your daughter would be
suffering this very day.

17:14.199 --> 17:16.036
I just... I want to apologize.

17:16.069 --> 17:18.805
This was, um, my first time...

17:18.838 --> 17:22.409
really, like, touching a vagina.

17:22.441 --> 17:25.712
Yeah, I figured that pretty early on.

17:25.743 --> 17:27.781
Cool.

17:27.813 --> 17:30.983
Any...

17:31.017 --> 17:33.954
tips?

17:33.986 --> 17:36.089
Maybe don't pound a cervix
like a medieval army

17:36.121 --> 17:37.723
trying to break through a castle door.

17:37.756 --> 17:39.058
Thank you.

17:43.396 --> 17:46.265
- If you let me back in, I think...
- No.

17:46.299 --> 17:47.667
Okay.

17:51.870 --> 17:55.041
What if, maybe,

17:55.075 --> 17:57.878
you would want to...

17:57.910 --> 17:59.679
try something on me?

17:59.713 --> 18:01.415
But please don't feel pressure to

18:01.447 --> 18:03.082
if you don't want to, but, like...

18:07.186 --> 18:10.890
Jim was never subtle
about how little he...

18:10.924 --> 18:12.502
gave a fuck.

18:12.508 --> 18:13.752
One time in Kansas City,

18:13.774 --> 18:16.259
they actually held up the
start of an inning for him.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.231
I'm so sorry.

18:18.263 --> 18:20.300
I had about 40 ounces of
iced tea brewing down there.

18:20.332 --> 18:22.902
Play ball! Play ball.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.472
Jim, you are absolutely one-of-a-kind.

18:25.504 --> 18:27.406
And I'm sure you're gonna be givin'
us all

18:27.440 --> 18:29.042
great stories for years to come.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.044
Probably even some tonight.

18:35.248 --> 18:37.384
All right,
let's hear from the man himself.

18:37.416 --> 18:40.052
Ladies and gentlemen, Jim Brockmire.

18:40.086 --> 18:43.757
Whoo!

18:43.790 --> 18:44.790
Whoo!

18:50.429 --> 18:52.798
- We love you, Jim!
- Thank you.

18:56.202 --> 18:57.771
That's obvious, really.

18:57.803 --> 18:59.138
If I do say so myself,

18:59.172 --> 19:02.075
from that tribute and
from the whole weekend.

19:08.013 --> 19:09.215
Well...

19:09.249 --> 19:10.784
it just seems like a lot of you

19:10.817 --> 19:12.786
kind of love me when
I'm at my most reckless,

19:12.819 --> 19:14.820
which is, uh...

19:14.854 --> 19:16.490
I mean, I get it. Believe me.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.825
Uh, it's understandable and everything.

19:19.858 --> 19:21.160
It's just, um...

19:21.194 --> 19:23.797
Well...

19:23.829 --> 19:25.197
It just doesn't feel that much different

19:25.231 --> 19:26.532
from the folks that like to laugh at me

19:26.566 --> 19:27.501
on the Internet is all.

19:30.302 --> 19:31.550
Joe Buck's one-man show

19:31.605 --> 19:33.538
is looking better and better.

19:33.958 --> 19:36.376
I think I'd be more relaxed
if I didn't see your face.

19:36.408 --> 19:37.977
Okay, that makes sense.

19:38.011 --> 19:40.113
And if I sang.

19:40.146 --> 19:41.915
Okay.

19:45.451 --> 19:48.521

19:48.554 --> 19:51.991

maybe watching this thing
just made me realize

20:25.290 --> 20:27.060
that everybody gets to decide

20:27.092 --> 20:29.396
the kind of man that they want to be.

20:29.428 --> 20:31.897
And maybe true change really is possible

20:31.931 --> 20:36.236
if we just have the will and
the self-control to be better.

20:36.269 --> 20:38.405
And I think I have that now.

20:39.606 --> 20:42.409
And if we need proof of that, well,

20:42.442 --> 20:46.079
all we need to do is look at
Mr. Brent Musburger over here.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.550
Because now he has a mustache!

20:50.582 --> 20:52.084
There it is! Come on!

20:54.486 --> 20:56.055
Come on, Brent.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.557
Come on, Brent!

21:05.964 --> 21:07.333
Musburger!

21:07.367 --> 21:08.568
Yeah, man!

21:08.600 --> 21:11.303
He's back, baby! The king is back!

21:13.172 --> 21:14.307
What's the matter?

21:14.339 --> 21:17.910
Um, the... the field is on fire.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.212
What?!

21:19.244 --> 21:21.447
A very friendly stranger came by,

21:21.481 --> 21:24.089
and he set fire to the outfield.

21:24.112 --> 21:25.584
Are you kidding?!

21:30.455 --> 21:31.590
Jim!

21:31.624 --> 21:33.126
Jim!

21:39.665 --> 21:41.568
Hello?

21:41.600 --> 21:44.404
H...

21:44.436 --> 21:46.973
Do you think we'll keep in touch?

21:47.305 --> 21:53.885
