<i>Help them.
Go and help them.</i>

02:00.205 --> 02:03.541
<i>They're gonna drown.
Pull over. They're not coming up.</i>

02:03.708 --> 02:04.709
<i>They'll come up.</i>

02:04.876 --> 02:06.753
<i>Please, Dad?
Please pull over.</i>

02:06.920 --> 02:10.048
<i>You know how long
ducks can hold their breath?</i>

02:10.215 --> 02:11.257
<i>No.</i>

02:11.424 --> 02:14.302
<i>As long as it takes
for you to stop looking at 'em.</i>

02:14.469 --> 02:16.721
<i>Then pull over
and let's look.</i>

02:20.391 --> 02:22.185
<i>Okay, let's look.</i>

02:24.896 --> 02:26.231
<i>I think they're dead.</i>

02:26.397 --> 02:28.024
<i>No, they're not dead.</i>

02:28.191 --> 02:29.776
<i>But how do you know?</i>

02:29.943 --> 02:33.238
<i>Ducks go down,
ducks come up.</i>

02:33.404 --> 02:35.949
<i>This is the natural order of things, son.</i>

02:36.115 --> 02:37.951
<i>There they are!</i>

02:38.117 --> 02:39.994
<i>Yep. There they are.</i>

02:40.161 --> 02:42.080
<i>They're okay.</i>

02:42.247 --> 02:43.665
<i>They're okay.</i>

02:43.832 --> 02:45.834
<i>And there you have it, folks.</i>

02:46.000 --> 02:47.752
<i>The ducks are alive and well.</i>

02:48.503 --> 02:50.839
<i>Kevin Garvey Jr. reporting.</i>

05:28.746 --> 05:29.956
What are you doing?

05:32.583 --> 05:35.753
Preventing the apocalypse.

05:35.920 --> 05:37.338
What are you doing?

05:48.474 --> 05:49.726
Don't smile.

05:55.356 --> 05:58.443
This is a songline.

06:01.112 --> 06:02.280
Is it?

06:16.794 --> 06:18.046
You can go.

06:20.798 --> 06:23.426
Uh, you don't get to keep that.

06:27.096 --> 06:30.725
Well, the mic, okay, that's fine,

06:30.892 --> 06:34.270
but the player,
can I have it back, please?

06:34.437 --> 06:35.646
Please?

06:42.070 --> 06:43.321
Oh, thank you. I...

06:45.323 --> 06:47.241
Where's the tape?

06:47.408 --> 06:50.244
What's on the tape is stolen.
You took it without permission.

06:50.411 --> 06:52.872
No, no, not that one.
That's fine. The other one.

06:53.039 --> 06:55.291
It says "Niagara '81"?

06:57.919 --> 07:00.671
Please. It's me and my kid
from a long time ago.

07:03.007 --> 07:06.177
It's really important to me. Please.

07:13.976 --> 07:15.311
Thank you.

07:16.187 --> 07:18.314
Yeah. Go, get.

07:18.481 --> 07:19.982
Yeah, thank you.

07:43.798 --> 07:45.633
<i>Why did
Travis wanna kill the President?</i>

07:45.800 --> 07:48.553
<i>Travis didn't wanna
kill anyone. He's not real.</i>

07:48.719 --> 07:49.887
<i>I don't get it.</i>

07:50.054 --> 07:52.390
<i>Travis is pretend.
He's in a movie.</i>

07:52.557 --> 07:55.768
<i>John is real,
and that's how he got the idea.</i>

07:55.935 --> 07:59.355
<i>So, John killed the
President because he saw it in a movie?</i>

07:59.522 --> 08:01.107
<i>He didn't kill the President.</i>

08:01.274 --> 08:03.151
<i>He tried to kill the President.</i>

08:03.317 --> 08:05.027
<i>Why?</i>

08:05.486 --> 08:07.488
<i>Because he's crazy, Kevin.</i>

08:10.074 --> 08:13.077
<i>But the President's
okay, right?</i>

08:13.744 --> 08:16.581
<i>Yeah, buddy.
The President's fine.</i>

08:16.747 --> 08:20.501
<i>And there you have it,
folks. The President is just fine.</i>

08:20.668 --> 08:23.087
<i>Kevin Garvey Jr. reporting.</i>

08:29.093 --> 08:30.761
- Howdy.
- G'day.

08:31.596 --> 08:34.098
Do you deliver mail
to the communities around here?

08:34.265 --> 08:35.433
Yes, sir.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.936
I'm looking for a friend,
Christopher Sunday.

08:39.103 --> 08:40.938
Maybe you have an address for him.

08:43.107 --> 08:46.319
If he's a friend of yours,
why don't you have his address?

08:47.612 --> 08:49.113
I misplaced it.

08:51.949 --> 08:53.451
You need to talk to Sharon.

08:53.618 --> 08:55.995
Okay. Who's Sharon?

08:56.162 --> 08:58.706
She's a liaison
to the indigenous community.

08:59.582 --> 09:02.710
All due respect, friend,
I don't need a liaison.

09:02.877 --> 09:05.671
I'm a member of the indigenous community.

09:09.926 --> 09:12.678
Sharon's over at the cultural center
on Borland Circuit.

09:12.845 --> 09:14.347
Anything else?

09:14.513 --> 09:15.973
Yeah.

09:16.140 --> 09:18.601
I had my mail forwarded

09:18.768 --> 09:21.979
when I heard
how helpful you were down here.

09:22.146 --> 09:23.648
Kevin Garvey.

09:34.158 --> 09:35.660
May I see some ID?

09:35.826 --> 09:38.329
Unfortunately, I lost it.

09:38.496 --> 09:40.665
But I can tell you the return address.

09:40.831 --> 09:46.045
One Matthew Jamison.
Miracle, Texas. US of A.

09:47.588 --> 09:50.091
If that's not enough,
I can tell you what's inside.

09:52.176 --> 09:55.012
You know
the best-selling book of all time?

09:57.265 --> 09:58.766
I reckon it's the Bible.

09:58.933 --> 10:01.519
You reckon right, my friend.

10:01.686 --> 10:04.188
And that there

10:04.355 --> 10:06.357
is the goddamn sequel.

10:19.829 --> 10:20.830
Oof.

11:15.968 --> 11:17.928
Bullshit. Where is it?

11:25.061 --> 11:26.854
Motherfucker!

11:39.909 --> 11:40.910
Oh.

11:41.118 --> 11:43.621
Hi, Noah. Is your daddy home?

11:45.039 --> 11:46.415
Let Mommy, honey.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.209
Hello?

11:48.918 --> 11:54.131
Uh, hello. This is Frank Johnson
from the Episcopal council.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.175
Can I speak to Reverend Matt Jamison?

11:56.342 --> 11:58.636
- Frank Johnson?
<i>- Yes.</i>

11:58.803 --> 12:02.306
Are you sure this isn't the former
police chief of Mapleton, New York?

12:03.057 --> 12:04.725
Because I know
Matt would wanna talk to him.

12:07.269 --> 12:09.522
- Who is it?
- It's your buddy in Australia.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.483
<i>I'm taking Noah to the park.</i>

12:12.650 --> 12:13.859
You want me to come?

12:14.026 --> 12:16.028
Not when you have
important work to do, Matt.

12:22.326 --> 12:23.661
<i>Hello?</i>

12:23.828 --> 12:25.663
Mary seems pissed. What'd you do?

12:25.830 --> 12:29.250
<i>I didn't do anything.
We're just working through some...</i>

12:29.417 --> 12:31.710
We're fine. How are things down under?

12:32.420 --> 12:36.340
Well, Matt, funny you should ask
about how things are going down here

12:36.507 --> 12:38.634
because it seems like
you don't give a shit.

12:38.801 --> 12:39.844
<i>What?</i>

12:40.010 --> 12:41.345
I'm not in it, asshole.

12:42.346 --> 12:45.141
- I'm sorry?
- I'm not in it.

12:45.933 --> 12:49.270
I spent hours talking you through
what I'm doing down here

12:49.437 --> 12:52.064
and there's not a word
in your goddamn book.

12:52.231 --> 12:55.693
Well, the book is about
what's happening to your son.

12:55.860 --> 12:59.321
- You know, if he were in Australia...
- I don't want him in Australia.

12:59.488 --> 13:03.242
I don't want him
anywhere fucking near Australia!

13:04.702 --> 13:09.206
<i>Okay, since you clearly weren't listening
the first time I told you,</i>

13:09.373 --> 13:12.543
I am not a part of Kevin Jr.'s story.

13:12.710 --> 13:14.879
He's a part of mine.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.715
He's the one who guided me here.

13:17.882 --> 13:19.425
<i>Why isn't that in your book?</i>

13:19.592 --> 13:21.260
Well, I'm sorry. But...

13:21.427 --> 13:23.053
W... When did this happen?

13:23.220 --> 13:25.306
When he was eight years old.

13:27.016 --> 13:29.602
Well, children don't
feature prominently in Scripture.

13:30.436 --> 13:32.062
What about Abraham's kid?

13:32.229 --> 13:33.731
<i>Isaac? He was 36.</i>

13:33.898 --> 13:36.901
No, no.
When Abraham tried to sacrifice him.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.778
He was a grown man.
Thirty-six years old.

13:41.655 --> 13:44.116
That makes no fucking sense at all.

13:44.658 --> 13:47.995
Did you uh...
Did you get the money I sent you?

13:48.162 --> 13:50.664
<i>Yeah, I did. Ha. What's it for?</i>

13:50.831 --> 13:52.541
Well, just to help you out.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.251
Oh, really?

13:54.418 --> 13:56.837
It's not so I'll keep my mouth shut

13:57.004 --> 14:02.885
and not tell my son you're writing an
unauthorized fucking biography about him?

14:03.052 --> 14:06.430
Kevin, telling him
would not be a good idea.

14:06.597 --> 14:08.265
He needs to just go through his life.

14:08.432 --> 14:11.852
Knowing any of this
would not be in his best interests.

14:12.019 --> 14:16.607
It would be in your best interest
to pick up some scuba gear,

14:16.774 --> 14:18.817
because if I fail down here,

14:18.984 --> 14:22.780
you are gonna be under
a fuck of a lot of water, shithead!

14:24.406 --> 14:27.117
Okay. Best of luck with that, Kevin.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.286
Go fuck yourself, Matt.

15:17.501 --> 15:18.502
Hello.

15:27.011 --> 15:28.721
Excuse me. Is Sharon around?

15:29.930 --> 15:32.766
She's in the crapper.
You can wait in her office.

15:33.851 --> 15:35.144
Oh, great. Thanks.

15:36.437 --> 15:37.479
Do I know you, mate?

15:38.981 --> 15:40.357
I sure hope not.

15:52.786 --> 15:53.787
Oh!

15:54.204 --> 15:57.833
Good afternoon. You must be Sharon.
I'm Frank.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.209
Hello.

15:59.376 --> 16:01.295
Is that snake Papunya?

16:01.462 --> 16:03.839
It is indeed.
How'd you guess?

16:04.006 --> 16:05.924
Oh, I'd know Papunya anywhere.

16:06.091 --> 16:08.636
They have a very precise style.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.888
Actually, I painted it myself.

16:11.055 --> 16:13.390
- You did not.
- I did.

16:13.557 --> 16:17.269
Well, then you are incredibly talented.

16:17.436 --> 16:19.938
So, what brings you here, Frank?

16:20.981 --> 16:23.817
I'm looking for a clever man
named Christopher Sunday.

16:23.984 --> 16:26.070
I was told
you might have an address for him.

16:26.236 --> 16:27.696
Well, the name rings a bell,

16:27.863 --> 16:30.032
but if you're making a documentary,
you have to go...

16:30.199 --> 16:31.909
No, no, no. Documentaries are boring.

16:32.076 --> 16:35.829
I'm just seeking enlightenment.

16:35.996 --> 16:40.250
I'm only interested in his wisdom,
his counsel, nothing else.

16:40.417 --> 16:42.086
I'd have to accompany you.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.171
I wouldn't want it any other way.

16:45.964 --> 16:48.550
Let me see
if I can get that address for you.

16:48.967 --> 16:51.470
Uh, is this your son?

16:52.096 --> 16:56.100
My grandson, Ollie.
He wants to be an astronaut.

16:57.601 --> 17:01.146
My son wanted to be
an anchorman on the news.

17:01.313 --> 17:03.107
Yeah? And did he?

17:03.273 --> 17:04.942
Nah. He's a cop.

17:05.109 --> 17:06.610
A good one.

17:06.777 --> 17:08.779
And your wife?

17:09.780 --> 17:12.700
She passed. Cancer.

17:13.283 --> 17:14.493
Oh, I'm so sorry.

17:14.660 --> 17:17.830
Thanks. It was a long time ago.
Did you find him?

17:17.996 --> 17:22.584
It seems that, um,
Chris lives in a community just a few...

17:25.129 --> 17:27.339
I'd like you to hear my side.

17:29.550 --> 17:32.803
"Appropriation of sacred ceremonies
without permission,

17:32.970 --> 17:36.765
"theft of creation songs,
misrepresentation of identity.

17:36.932 --> 17:40.769
"Under no circumstances should this man
be given access to tribal elders."

17:40.936 --> 17:44.064
Shame on you.
You've stolen from these people.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.607
Really, I've stolen?

17:45.774 --> 17:49.903
Same way your government stole
a whole generation of their children?

17:50.070 --> 17:51.321
We apologized for that.

17:51.488 --> 17:53.490
Shame on you, Sharon.

17:53.657 --> 17:55.826
I have lived among these people.

17:55.993 --> 17:58.787
I am trying to fucking save these people.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.831
Save them from what? Oi!

19:19.159 --> 19:21.703
I'm sorry if I mispronounced.

19:21.870 --> 19:23.956
Are you Christopher Sunday?

19:24.665 --> 19:26.083
Chris.

19:26.250 --> 19:29.419
Chris, it's a real honor to meet you.

19:29.586 --> 19:32.172
I am Kevin, Totem of the Bush Snake.

19:34.758 --> 19:37.177
I've come a long way to find you.

19:40.597 --> 19:42.099
You're scared.

19:45.602 --> 19:47.271
I am, yes.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.608
Of what?

19:57.030 --> 19:58.615
<i>I used to hear voices.</i>

20:01.243 --> 20:05.664
They started about five minutes after
it happened, after people disappeared.

20:06.707 --> 20:09.793
So they put me in an institution.

20:09.960 --> 20:15.966
And there I stayed, arguing with something
nobody else could even see, fighting it...

20:16.800 --> 20:18.760
And then I stopped fighting.

20:20.470 --> 20:23.348
And I started doing
what the voices told me.

20:24.808 --> 20:30.314
The last thing they told me
was to leave, to go to Australia.

20:31.231 --> 20:35.485
It's a pretty big country
you got here.

20:35.652 --> 20:38.113
A little specificity would've been nice,

20:38.280 --> 20:42.034
but I figured
instructions were forthcoming,

20:42.200 --> 20:46.580
and I always wanted to check out
the Opera House, so I flew to Sydney.

20:47.497 --> 20:50.500
Bought a ticket for <i>Verdi,</i>
put on a nice suit,

20:50.667 --> 20:53.587
and I'm on my way from the hotel

20:53.754 --> 20:57.174
when this guy,
this hippie with a red headband,

20:58.592 --> 21:03.513
walks right up to me and says,
"Do you wanna talk to God?"

21:05.265 --> 21:07.142
Well, that's gotta be it, right?

21:07.309 --> 21:10.812
So I said, "Fuck, yeah,
I wanna talk to God."

21:10.979 --> 21:15.192
And he said, "Then you've gotta talk
in God's tongue, mate."

21:16.443 --> 21:21.865
<i>God's tongue, it turns out,
is an experimental, high-end hallucinogen</i>

21:22.032 --> 21:23.909
<i>this guy brews in his basement.</i>

21:24.493 --> 21:28.038
And I wake up two weeks later

21:28.205 --> 21:33.126
in a hotel room in Perth
on the opposite fucking coast.

21:33.293 --> 21:36.380
There's a smoldering mattress next to me

21:36.546 --> 21:39.549
and a bunch of white dudes
lying around in war paint.

21:40.717 --> 21:43.136
And I have no fucking memory

21:43.303 --> 21:46.431
how I got there
or what happened while I did.

21:48.558 --> 21:52.729
Also, God did not talk to me.

21:53.897 --> 21:56.900
And I'm thinking
this is a fucking waste of time,

21:57.067 --> 22:00.821
at best, a misguided detour,

22:03.240 --> 22:06.994
when I notice the TV
in the hotel room is on.

22:09.663 --> 22:12.666
And do you know
what I saw on that TV, Chris?

22:15.168 --> 22:16.503
A chicken.

22:18.171 --> 22:19.756
On October the 14th,

22:19.923 --> 22:23.593
a town in the outback
lost its entire population.

22:23.760 --> 22:26.096
A small town, only 14 people.

22:26.263 --> 22:29.558
But all of them vanished,
even the animals.

22:29.725 --> 22:34.104
<i>Every living thing in that town
was gone except for one thing.</i>

22:35.022 --> 22:36.606
An egg.

22:36.773 --> 22:41.653
Two days later,
it hatched and they named him Tony.

22:42.904 --> 22:46.283
And at first, nobody took him seriously.

22:46.450 --> 22:48.660
But then rumors started.

22:48.827 --> 22:53.832
Rumors that the chicken could help people
find whatever they were looking for.

22:54.916 --> 23:00.005
And this is the first fucking thing I hear
when I wake up from a two-week acid trip?

23:01.048 --> 23:02.966
It's gotta be a fucking sign.

23:03.133 --> 23:09.973
So, I hop on the train,
4,000 kilometers back across the country,

23:10.140 --> 23:11.975
and I go see Tony.

23:12.142 --> 23:14.102
So, I give this guy my money,

23:14.269 --> 23:19.399
guy puts the chicken in front of me,
and says, "What are you looking for?"

23:21.068 --> 23:23.153
Well, I don't know
what I'm looking for yet.

23:23.320 --> 23:26.156
That's the point. I need Tony to tell me.

23:26.323 --> 23:28.784
And the guy says, "Doesn't work that way.

23:28.950 --> 23:32.496
"You've gotta give Tony
something to look for."

23:32.662 --> 23:34.498
So I said, "Purpose.

23:36.416 --> 23:38.752
"I want some fucking purpose."

23:44.091 --> 23:49.429
And that very minute, Tony jumped up
on my pack and starts pecking.

23:52.265 --> 23:56.353
He was pecking this.

24:04.986 --> 24:07.531
When my kid was about eight years old,

24:07.697 --> 24:10.408
my wife gave him a tape recorder
for Christmas.

24:11.701 --> 24:13.453
She died about a month later,

24:13.620 --> 24:17.999
so he kept it with him all the time.
All the time.

24:19.876 --> 24:23.797
Well, that summer, I took him
on a road trip to Niagara Falls.

24:26.716 --> 24:30.053
And he just about drove me nuts...

24:35.392 --> 24:39.229
Recording everything we said.

24:45.026 --> 24:46.278
Excuse me.

24:47.779 --> 24:49.781
I like listening to it.

24:52.409 --> 24:55.245
This is the tape
that Tony pecked.

24:56.746 --> 24:58.290
<i>I didn't rewind it.</i>

25:01.251 --> 25:07.090
I put it in the player and waited
for one last voice to tell me what to do.

25:10.260 --> 25:11.928
<i>You have to sing it.</i>

25:12.095 --> 25:13.388
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

25:13.555 --> 25:16.266
<i>It's for little kids.
You're a big kid now.</i>

25:16.433 --> 25:19.060
<i>You have to or it won't stop.</i>

25:19.227 --> 25:20.812
<i>It's gonna get in the car!</i>

25:20.979 --> 25:23.565
<i>We're pulled over. We're safe.</i>

25:23.732 --> 25:26.318
<i>Please, Daddy?
Just sing it.</i>

25:27.777 --> 25:29.613
<i>Okay.</i>

25:30.947 --> 25:35.785
<i>The itsy-bitsy spider
Climbed up the water spout</i>

25:35.952 --> 25:40.207
<i>Down came the rain
And washed the spider out</i>

25:40.373 --> 25:45.128
<i>Out came the sun
And dried up all the rain</i>

25:45.295 --> 25:50.842
<i>And the itsy-bitsy spider
Climbed up the spout again</i>

25:53.678 --> 25:55.096
<i>You did it.</i>

26:04.564 --> 26:09.277
On the seventh-year anniversary
of the Sudden Departure,

26:09.444 --> 26:13.114
I believe the rains will come,

26:13.281 --> 26:17.160
and with them, a great flood.

26:19.329 --> 26:21.665
I have to sing to make it stop.

26:26.419 --> 26:27.754
You have to sing?

26:28.713 --> 26:33.093
For the last two years, I've been
working my way down the songline.

26:34.010 --> 26:38.348
I don't have to tell you
every community has a different part,

26:38.515 --> 26:42.519
so I've had to learn it piece by piece,

26:42.686 --> 26:47.941
every sacred site,
every ceremony, every word.

26:49.109 --> 26:51.027
You want my song?

26:51.194 --> 26:52.862
It's the last one.

26:56.116 --> 26:58.201
The last one.

26:58.368 --> 27:05.000
And it is my understanding that you are
the only man alive who knows it.

27:05.959 --> 27:10.046
My song is bring the rain, not stop it.

27:12.465 --> 27:18.054
Well, that's all subject
to interpretation.

27:19.973 --> 27:21.558
Do you want to stop the flood?

27:23.184 --> 27:24.269
I do.

27:28.315 --> 27:29.733
Start there.

27:38.074 --> 27:39.242
You got a deal.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.294
Can you see the problem?

27:49.461 --> 27:52.839
Yeah, your swamp cooler's leaking
like a motherfucker.

27:53.006 --> 27:54.591
Can you fix it, then?

27:54.758 --> 27:56.760
You got a pipe wrench or some duct...

28:01.306 --> 28:02.515
Ah, shit!

28:05.810 --> 28:07.228
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

28:07.771 --> 28:11.107
Don't believe a word
that woman says about me.

28:11.274 --> 28:13.443
Remember, we've got a deal.

28:15.278 --> 28:16.488
<i>Oh!</i>

28:25.205 --> 28:26.831
I rolled the other way.

28:26.998 --> 28:29.459
You saw me, right?
I... I tried to miss you.

28:30.460 --> 28:32.796
- Chris, can you hear me?
- Settle down.

28:32.962 --> 28:35.632
I'm just concerned
that when we get to the hospital,

28:35.799 --> 28:37.133
they're gonna separate us.

28:37.300 --> 28:39.552
And Chris promised
he'd teach me something.

28:39.719 --> 28:42.806
Didn't you, Chris? Chris, Chris, Chris,
nod if you can hear me.

28:42.972 --> 28:44.557
Otherwise, they're not gonna believe me...

28:44.724 --> 28:47.102
Sit! Sit.

28:47.268 --> 28:50.480
Friend, I am acting in your best interest.

28:50.647 --> 28:53.691
You are looking
at an initiated Yanmedjaran.

28:53.858 --> 28:56.528
Show a little respect
for your fucking elder.

29:10.959 --> 29:13.586
Uh, I'm sorry I lost it.

29:15.964 --> 29:17.799
You're gonna leave me here? Ah!

29:28.476 --> 29:31.521
Fuck me!

29:31.688 --> 29:35.692
Fucking, fucking, fuck, fuck, fuck!

29:40.280 --> 29:42.866
<i>I don't think this is the way
we're supposed to go.</i>

29:43.324 --> 29:48.788
<i>Garvey men don't follow
a highlighter on a goddamn triptych, son.</i>

29:48.955 --> 29:50.582
<i>But what if we get lost?</i>

29:50.748 --> 29:52.876
<i>AAA wants you
to take the interstates</i>

29:53.042 --> 29:55.920
<i>to get you to drive
by the AAA Howard Johnson's</i>

29:56.087 --> 29:58.965
<i>and the AAA giant balls of twine.</i>

29:59.132 --> 30:02.886
<i>You want a real adventure,
you gotta chart your own course.</i>

31:09.786 --> 31:10.828
Hey!

31:15.291 --> 31:17.126
Stop. Ah!

31:18.169 --> 31:20.296
Hey! Stop!

31:20.463 --> 31:22.632
Stop! Ah!

31:23.049 --> 31:25.009
Man, what are you doing?

31:28.137 --> 31:29.472
They didn't take me.

31:30.974 --> 31:31.975
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

31:32.141 --> 31:34.978
Slow down, slow down.
Let's just talk for a sec.

31:36.062 --> 31:37.564
They didn't take me.

31:38.648 --> 31:40.650
Buddy, they didn't take most of us.

31:40.817 --> 31:42.485
You're not alone, trust me.

31:42.652 --> 31:44.862
But that was seven years ago.

31:46.406 --> 31:49.492
Would you kill a baby
if it would cure cancer?

31:51.160 --> 31:52.245
What?

31:53.162 --> 31:56.666
Would you kill a baby
if it would cure cancer?

31:59.502 --> 32:00.503
No.

32:04.132 --> 32:05.967
That is exactly what I said.

32:08.845 --> 32:09.846
Wait!

32:22.066 --> 32:23.192
Whoa, shit!

32:29.198 --> 32:30.199
Ah!

32:56.476 --> 32:58.811
Please let there be some goddamn water.

33:01.105 --> 33:03.983
Fucking alcoholic. Jesus.

33:06.319 --> 33:10.073
I know what you're trying to do,
but it's not gonna work.

33:10.239 --> 33:13.409
You can't stop me, asshole.

33:37.350 --> 33:38.434
No!

33:39.143 --> 33:40.228
No!

33:40.770 --> 33:43.064
No! No!

33:44.899 --> 33:46.109
No!

34:23.438 --> 34:24.647
Please.

34:31.988 --> 34:34.115
<i>Kevin Garvey Jr. reporting.</i>

34:54.427 --> 34:55.428
God.

35:47.522 --> 35:50.775
Buddy, I know you're my totem, but...

35:52.985 --> 35:55.363
I got some bad news for you.

35:55.530 --> 35:58.407
If I go down,
I don't think I'm getting up.

35:59.575 --> 36:00.743
So...

36:03.371 --> 36:05.039
I need to eat you.

36:08.793 --> 36:10.127
I'm sorry.

36:12.922 --> 36:16.592
Know that you gave your life

36:19.011 --> 36:22.348
for something greater than yourself.

36:33.943 --> 36:35.653
Oh!

36:35.945 --> 36:36.946
Ah!

36:49.625 --> 36:52.086
Come on. Motherfucking...

36:56.883 --> 36:58.134
Shit.

39:49.138 --> 39:50.306
Help.

40:12.578 --> 40:14.622
Oh, hey there.

40:44.860 --> 40:46.612
Oh, no.

40:51.534 --> 40:52.785
Fucker!

40:53.160 --> 40:54.370
Oh, oh!

40:55.621 --> 40:56.789
Hello?

40:59.917 --> 41:01.418
Anybody here?

41:22.523 --> 41:24.066
Hello?

41:24.233 --> 41:26.902
<i>Will you accept
a collect international call from...</i>

41:27.069 --> 41:28.737
<i>Kevin Garvey Sr.</i>

41:30.906 --> 41:32.491
All right, fine.

41:34.285 --> 41:36.287
Do you know what time it is here?

41:36.453 --> 41:38.747
I don't care what time it is.
What day is it?

41:38.914 --> 41:40.583
<i>- What?</i>
- What day is it?

41:40.749 --> 41:42.751
How long since we last talked?

41:43.377 --> 41:45.921
Uh, that was three weeks ago.

41:47.089 --> 41:48.799
Oh, shit.

41:49.341 --> 41:51.468
There's just, like, eight days left.

41:51.635 --> 41:52.761
<i>Shit.</i>

41:53.554 --> 41:56.182
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Kevin.

41:56.348 --> 41:57.892
I'm actually glad you called.

41:58.058 --> 42:01.103
Could you send a photocopy
of the book back to me?

42:01.270 --> 42:04.106
- I gave the original...
<i>- No, I threw it away.</i>

42:04.273 --> 42:05.441
- What?
<i>- Doesn't matter.</i>

42:05.608 --> 42:08.861
Look, I need you to call
the Kurripa Hospital.

42:09.028 --> 42:11.697
That's Kur-ri-pa.

42:11.864 --> 42:15.701
Find out if there's a patient there
named Christopher Sunday.

42:16.535 --> 42:17.578
Matt?

42:19.330 --> 42:20.873
You threw it away?

42:21.040 --> 42:24.251
My friend, you've gotta move past
that dumb book of yours.

42:24.418 --> 42:26.045
I don't know where I am,

42:26.212 --> 42:30.466
but once I find out, I'm gonna need
your help in getting to this hospital.

42:30.633 --> 42:32.218
<i>- Kevin.</i>
- Yeah?

42:32.384 --> 42:34.136
Go fuck yourself.

43:07.169 --> 43:09.171
- Hey there.
- Hello.

43:11.674 --> 43:13.217
You're building a boat.

43:13.759 --> 43:14.760
Uh-huh.

43:19.348 --> 43:20.683
For the flood.

43:26.939 --> 43:29.233
I need to get to the hospital in Kurripa.

43:29.400 --> 43:32.194
Any chance you guys
could give me a ride there?

43:32.361 --> 43:35.030
Lady of the house will take
better care of you than the hospital.

43:35.197 --> 43:39.535
No, I'm fine.
Anybody here know Christopher Sunday?

43:39.702 --> 43:41.787
Oh, yeah, sure. We all know each other.

43:41.954 --> 43:44.581
- It's a tiny country.
<i>- I know Chris.</i>

43:46.375 --> 43:48.085
You the fella that landed on him?

43:50.879 --> 43:52.214
He's dead.

43:57.720 --> 43:59.054
He's dead?

44:00.931 --> 44:02.057
Shit.

44:29.793 --> 44:31.462
"Caleb's arthritis."

44:33.255 --> 44:34.548
You Caleb?

44:35.841 --> 44:37.301
I'm in pain, buddy.

44:45.851 --> 44:46.852
Mmm.

47:30.182 --> 47:31.266
Hey.

47:37.689 --> 47:39.525
What are you ladies up to?

47:42.986 --> 47:44.780
Oh, come on.

48:24.236 --> 48:25.404
Hello.

48:27.531 --> 48:28.574
Hi.

48:31.118 --> 48:32.911
Would you like some tea?

48:38.000 --> 48:39.501
How's your arm?

48:41.503 --> 48:43.171
Itches like hell.

48:44.423 --> 48:47.593
We get a lot of brown
and tiger snakes out here.

48:49.011 --> 48:51.430
I gave you anti-venom
for both just to be safe.

48:52.264 --> 48:53.724
Much obliged.

49:00.689 --> 49:02.441
You looked through my photos.

49:03.859 --> 49:06.278
I was hungry. It was in the fridge.

49:10.949 --> 49:12.117
What's your name?

49:14.119 --> 49:15.287
Grace.

49:17.122 --> 49:18.707
Nice to meet you.

49:19.541 --> 49:21.793
- I'm Kev...
- I just killed a man.

49:26.715 --> 49:27.841
Okay.

49:29.051 --> 49:31.011
I'll turn myself in tomorrow.

49:33.221 --> 49:35.891
The other ladies you saw,
they had nothing to do with it.

49:36.058 --> 49:39.561
I'm hoping you'll consider leaving them
out of whatever you tell the police.

49:42.773 --> 49:44.900
Are you all alone out here?

49:46.902 --> 49:47.944
Yes.

49:49.571 --> 49:51.239
Your family's gone?

49:52.407 --> 49:53.492
Yes.

49:55.410 --> 49:56.912
On the 14th?

49:57.079 --> 49:58.914
It was the 15th here.

50:00.749 --> 50:02.084
I keep forgetting that.

50:04.336 --> 50:05.587
You were with them?

50:06.880 --> 50:10.384
I was in town at the Big W.

50:12.886 --> 50:14.971
The register girl
vanished right in front of me.

50:16.598 --> 50:18.600
She was holding my box of Weet-Bix.

50:20.227 --> 50:21.853
Took it with her.

50:24.564 --> 50:26.942
I knew what it was the moment it happened.

50:29.611 --> 50:31.029
The Rapture.

50:33.281 --> 50:36.702
<i>I finally made it home the next night.</i>

50:37.619 --> 50:41.456
I already knew the chapel would be empty
before I set foot inside.

50:44.960 --> 50:46.128
Their Bibles...

50:47.045 --> 50:50.090
Liam's, Abigail's,

50:50.257 --> 50:54.261
David's, Samantha's, Jimmy's.

50:54.970 --> 50:58.432
Sam, my husband, his Bible, too.

51:01.727 --> 51:03.687
All in a nice, neat row.

51:06.815 --> 51:09.651
And when I saw them in that moment...

51:11.737 --> 51:13.488
I felt so blessed

51:14.990 --> 51:16.867
because God showed me.

51:18.160 --> 51:22.914
He gave me confirmation
that my family now sat by his side.

51:26.084 --> 51:28.545
<i>For two years, I spread his word.</i>

51:28.712 --> 51:31.840
For two years, I endured...

51:34.426 --> 51:35.927
And held true.

51:43.977 --> 51:45.854
Then I received a phone call.

51:47.022 --> 51:49.357
Remains had been found on my property.

51:53.195 --> 51:55.405
The remains of five children.

51:59.242 --> 52:00.619
Just bones.

52:01.870 --> 52:03.663
<i>Bleached in the sun.</i>

52:07.709 --> 52:09.127
The phones were down.

52:11.963 --> 52:16.384
They had no way of knowing
if I was ever coming home

52:16.551 --> 52:19.262
or if I had simply vanished
like their father had.

52:20.722 --> 52:22.682
So they set out on foot,

52:24.059 --> 52:25.769
across the flats,

52:26.937 --> 52:28.104
alone.

52:34.986 --> 52:37.155
I thought they had gone, you see.

52:39.574 --> 52:41.284
Gone with everyone else.

52:45.956 --> 52:50.085
I never even considered
searching for them.

52:53.755 --> 52:55.173
If I had...

53:04.933 --> 53:09.729
I took the cross from the chapel
and brought it out there

53:12.274 --> 53:14.109
to mark the place where they died.

53:20.282 --> 53:22.117
The place where I found you.

53:30.792 --> 53:33.128
This was in your hand.

53:39.634 --> 53:43.346
A page written like scripture.

53:44.723 --> 53:46.892
One I'd never seen or heard of before.

53:48.143 --> 53:49.561
It tells of a man,

53:50.812 --> 53:53.148
a police chief named Kevin,

53:55.233 --> 54:00.906
who drowned and passed into the land
of the dead and spoke to them.

54:02.741 --> 54:06.828
Who freed them from their pain
and rose again.

54:09.164 --> 54:11.291
<i>Just 20 kilometers from here,</i>

54:13.168 --> 54:16.671
there's a police chief named Kevin.

54:19.341 --> 54:21.343
What are the chances of that?

54:22.802 --> 54:24.387
It had to be him.

54:25.513 --> 54:30.477
So, I went to him, to Kevin,
and I asked for his help.

54:33.355 --> 54:37.275
And when he refused, I drowned him...

54:41.029 --> 54:43.698
Because I thought he was testing me.

54:45.700 --> 54:48.119
Because I thought he'd come back.

54:50.121 --> 54:52.749
And once I'd proven my faith,

54:52.916 --> 54:59.339
he would have no choice but to help me
talk to my children one last time.

55:06.179 --> 55:08.390
So I thought you were sent by God.

55:13.061 --> 55:15.397
Sent with a message just for me.

55:26.449 --> 55:28.243
But you're not an angel.

55:30.245 --> 55:31.871
There is no message.

55:33.665 --> 55:35.542
And God doesn't care about me.

55:43.925 --> 55:46.678
It's all just a story I told myself.

55:51.349 --> 55:55.437
It's just a stupid, silly story.

55:59.024 --> 56:01.151
And I believed it because...

56:10.702 --> 56:12.620
I've gotta be crazy, haven't I?

56:20.128 --> 56:21.463
No, Grace.

56:24.507 --> 56:26.968
I don't think you're crazy at all.

56:31.931 --> 56:34.267
You just got the wrong Kevin.

57:45.004 --> 57:46.005
