how far he'll get?

is ready for his close-up.

to show my kids.

All right, well, the reason

05:01.039 --> 05:04.347
we need to clean
this basement out today is...

05:04.391 --> 05:05.392
because Mama's
selling the house.

05:05.435 --> 05:06.958
What?

05:07.002 --> 05:09.396
Why would Mama be trying
to sell our home?

05:09.439 --> 05:12.224
Because she's been traveling
for the last couple of years

05:12.268 --> 05:13.356
and she wants to spend
more time

05:13.400 --> 05:15.053
in Italy with her boyfriend.

05:15.097 --> 05:16.794
You remember, Gian-coitus?

05:16.838 --> 05:19.623
- Why y'all ain't tell me?
- Because we knew you would

05:19.667 --> 05:21.712
flip out, much like
you're doing now.

05:21.756 --> 05:23.192
You are
a very emotional person.

05:23.235 --> 05:25.977

Me? Emotional!

05:26.021 --> 05:28.676

love you so much.

- Do what?

Don't you lock me
in this basement again

06:17.115 --> 06:18.856
Nah, player.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.467
Look, I should have
told you that Mama

06:20.510 --> 06:21.859
was selling the house.

06:21.903 --> 06:24.079
I just wanted to break it
to you at the right time.

I can't handle things.

06:26.429 --> 06:27.996
[banging on door]

06:28.039 --> 06:30.651
- Gary, open it.
- I said no.

06:30.694 --> 06:32.392
I should have told you
when I booked the movie

06:32.435 --> 06:34.045
that I'd be gone
for six weeks.

06:34.089 --> 06:36.439
I just felt bad.
- You should feel bad.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.485
You're breaking up
the Williams brothers summer

06:38.528 --> 06:40.051
for that stupid movie.

06:40.095 --> 06:42.097
Nobody's asking
for "Black Goonies."

06:42.140 --> 06:44.099
That's just
a temporary title.

06:44.142 --> 06:46.362
Come on man, open up.

06:48.277 --> 06:49.409
Please?

06:54.936 --> 06:56.111
All I wanted
was to have another

06:56.154 --> 06:58.592
Williams brothers summer.

06:58.635 --> 07:02.073
I'm sorry, but six weeks
isn't that long.

07:02.117 --> 07:03.248
Are you kidding?

07:03.292 --> 07:05.207
Jason killed 100 campers
in six weeks.

07:05.250 --> 07:06.861
No, he didn't
kill the campers.

07:06.904 --> 07:08.210
He killed the counselors

07:08.253 --> 07:10.125
and a couple
of no-account drifters.

07:10.168 --> 07:11.431
That still
made my point, though.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.302
Look I still got a week
before I have to go.

07:13.345 --> 07:15.522
You want to play some football
in the living room?

07:15.565 --> 07:16.958

07:17.001 --> 07:20.352
Now, y'all know better.
No football in this house.

07:20.396 --> 07:21.441
You heard her.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.268
No football
in this house, Kenan.

07:26.054 --> 07:28.404
<i>Okay, I admit it.</i>

07:28.448 --> 07:31.973
You're an adult, and I
should treat you like one.

smell great down there.

Look, man, I want Mama
to be happy too.

07:52.950 --> 07:54.343
I'm not a monster.

07:54.386 --> 07:56.345
I'm selfish,
but I'm not a monster.

07:56.388 --> 07:57.912
I know.

07:57.955 --> 08:00.262
Look, if you want
some keepsakes,

08:00.305 --> 08:01.916
you can bring them
back to our house.

08:01.959 --> 08:03.091
- Yeah.
- All right?

08:03.134 --> 08:04.571
Hey.
- Hmm?

08:04.614 --> 08:07.095
We should have one last
hurrah up in here,

08:07.138 --> 08:10.141
say goodbye proper-like.
- Hell yeah.

08:10.185 --> 08:11.316
Well, what's something
we always wanted to do

08:11.360 --> 08:12.448
that Mama wouldn't let us?

08:14.145 --> 08:15.582
both: Falcons versus Eagles.

08:15.625 --> 08:17.932
Oh, yeah,
this is gonna happen.

Oh, okay, come on down.

09:24.215 --> 09:25.608
- Hey, fellas.
- Hey.

What's good?

09:26.783 --> 09:28.045
You just gonna howdy
walk your ass

09:28.089 --> 09:29.569
up in this house like that?
- Easy.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.396
You left your door wide open.

09:31.440 --> 09:34.617
This neighborhood is
gentrifying but not that fast.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.359
Thank you.
But we are almost done here.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.187
So--I'm sorry.
What's your name?

09:39.230 --> 09:41.668
No names.
Best to keep it professional,

09:41.711 --> 09:43.887
you know, like how prostitutes
don't kiss on the mouth?

09:43.931 --> 09:47.195
- Mm, respect.
- No. And ew.

09:47.238 --> 09:49.893
Okay, well,
I guess you can take the couch,

09:49.937 --> 09:53.636
the freezer, and everything
on this side of the room.

09:53.680 --> 09:55.551
Actually,
you could take the couch,

09:55.595 --> 09:57.640
the freezer,
and them two things over there.

09:57.684 --> 09:59.729
Well, what about
all this junk?

09:59.773 --> 10:02.166
Yeah, Gary,
what about all this junk?

10:02.210 --> 10:03.646
Oh, this is not junk.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.605
This is my stuff.

10:05.648 --> 10:06.910
Easy, Gary.

10:06.954 --> 10:09.391
Unjunk Your Bunk lady
calls everything junk.

10:09.434 --> 10:11.219
It's company policy.

10:11.262 --> 10:12.742
Yeah, and Kenan
wants to know where

10:12.786 --> 10:14.309
you plan on putting
all this stuff.

10:14.352 --> 10:17.094
And Gary has decided
our house.

10:17.138 --> 10:19.096
Come on, man,
you can't bring 30 boxes

10:19.140 --> 10:20.968
of junk into my house.

10:21.011 --> 10:22.447
Hold on. Wait a minute.

10:22.491 --> 10:24.449
You just said it was our house.
Now it's your house?

10:24.493 --> 10:25.581
Well, when you're trying
to turn it

10:25.625 --> 10:27.583
into a garbage heap,
it is, yeah.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.717
Ooh, "garbage"
is a very offensive term,

10:30.760 --> 10:33.241
especially when you're talking
about somebody's junk.

10:33.284 --> 10:34.895
Thank you.

10:34.938 --> 10:36.940
And for the record,
were you a prostitute,

10:36.984 --> 10:38.115
or you just know
prostitute facts?

10:38.159 --> 10:39.290

Why would you think
that I would be okay with you

10:48.909 --> 10:50.388
bringing all this stuff
to the house?

10:50.432 --> 10:51.563
Where we gonna even put it?

10:51.607 --> 10:53.304
The back of the girls' room

10:53.348 --> 10:54.654
or the back of Rick's room

10:54.697 --> 10:56.177
or the back
of the laundry room.

10:56.220 --> 10:59.441
There's plenty of backs
of rooms in that big house.

10:59.484 --> 11:00.964
All right, well let's just
see what's so important,

11:01.008 --> 11:02.705
you got to displace
my babies.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.186
- Not displacing nobody.
- What even is this?

11:05.229 --> 11:07.057
What is this?
- Be careful with that.

11:07.101 --> 11:08.972
Oh, yeah,
you definitely need

11:09.016 --> 11:10.974
300 rap demos that you made
in high school.

11:11.018 --> 11:14.021
Actually,
I made those in middle school.

11:14.064 --> 11:16.763
I was rappin'
at a high school level.

♪ Poseidon was hating hard

11:21.855 --> 11:24.031
That was called
"Blooded as a Rhyme Scheme."

11:24.074 --> 11:26.076
"The Iliad"
was not to be rapped.

11:26.120 --> 11:28.731
I think you know that.
- That was groundbreaking, fam.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.212
And what about
these old-ass light bulbs?

11:31.255 --> 11:33.301
These are
new-ass light bulbs.

11:33.344 --> 11:34.824
Come on, man,
they might have been new

11:34.868 --> 11:36.783
15 years ago,

11:36.826 --> 11:39.786
but nobody's even using
incandescents anymore.

11:39.829 --> 11:43.050
It's all about
the energy-saving LEDs.

11:43.093 --> 11:45.052
Green.

11:45.095 --> 11:46.140
What?

11:46.183 --> 11:47.707
These'll come back,
okay, man?

11:47.750 --> 11:49.056
What's old is new again.

11:49.099 --> 11:50.753

like wide-legged pants

11:50.797 --> 11:52.450

or Mayim Bialik.

11:52.494 --> 11:56.193

no "Sabrina" comic books.

this is worthless, all right?

12:09.467 --> 12:10.730
This means a lot to me, man.

This is everything I have
in the world,

12:11.818 --> 12:13.254
and I'm not throwing it away.

12:13.297 --> 12:15.735
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not.

12:17.345 --> 12:18.694
In case y'all
were wondering,

12:18.738 --> 12:20.348
I brought this from home.

12:20.391 --> 12:21.784
Yeah, I hope so,
because no one's been

12:21.828 --> 12:23.307

12:23.351 --> 12:25.222
Mm.

'cause... I'm full.

to your truck, please.

- Okay.

- Take the box.
- Okay.

had my back.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.005
What are you talking about?

13:09.049 --> 13:11.268
We were sitting on the porch
of this very house,

13:11.312 --> 13:13.009
and you said,
"Oh, I have your back

13:13.053 --> 13:14.794
no matter what, forever."

13:14.837 --> 13:17.231
You remember that, Kenan?
You remember that?

sound like me.

13:20.277 --> 13:21.713
Oh, wow,

to me, you don't remember.

13:23.237 --> 13:24.673
It's not about convenience,
man.

together.

13:37.904 --> 13:40.863
You can come with me.
- Yeah, right.

13:40.907 --> 13:43.170
For real. I already talked
to Mom about it.

and keep me company on the set.

- You did that for me?
- Of course, man.

I always have your back, man.

14:01.144 --> 14:03.190
And if this stuff
means that much to you,

14:03.233 --> 14:05.627
we'll get you a storage unit...
or five.

14:05.670 --> 14:07.542
Man, damn, a storage unit?

14:07.585 --> 14:09.413

you can't leave your stuff

16:03.658 --> 16:07.618
That is--
wow.

16:07.662 --> 16:10.621
That is literal insanity
you just said.

16:10.665 --> 16:13.885
<i>No, it's true.</i> <i>
And you wanted it that way.</i>

16:16.410 --> 16:17.977
Ha-ha!

16:18.020 --> 16:21.502
What are you doing on my
pirate ship, Black Goonies?

16:21.545 --> 16:24.157
You can't stop us, mister.
This is our time.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.029
Raise the roof, Black Goonies!

16:27.073 --> 16:28.944
Why does is say
"Black Goonies" so much?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.467
And every time
you have a victory,

16:30.511 --> 16:32.208
do you have to pop-lock?

16:32.252 --> 16:33.514
Sometimes I break-dance.

16:33.557 --> 16:34.689
Kenan, go wash up
for dinner.

16:34.732 --> 16:35.995
I need to talk to Gary
for a minute.

16:36.038 --> 16:37.997
I'd like to eat
your baked chicken

16:38.040 --> 16:40.869
with some fava beans
and a nice Chianti.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.349
[slurping]

16:42.392 --> 16:44.351
Boy, get your butt upstairs.

16:44.394 --> 16:46.527
And I told you
not to watch that movie.

16:46.570 --> 16:50.705
So, Gary, I hear
you're planning on coming

16:50.748 --> 16:53.490
to North Carolina with Kenan
to shoot his movie.

16:53.534 --> 16:56.667
Yeah.
He just needs me, poor guy.

16:56.711 --> 16:59.061
But listen,
I've seen your drawings,

16:59.105 --> 17:01.324
and I know how much you love
those "Sabrina" comics.

17:01.368 --> 17:06.460
So I found an art camp for you
that I think you'll like.

17:06.502 --> 17:08.114
What's wrong
with me going with Kenan?

17:08.156 --> 17:09.376
Oh, nothing.

17:09.419 --> 17:12.074
I mean, it's just,
Kenan loves to perform.

17:12.117 --> 17:15.643
And, baby, I want to help you
figure out what you love to do

17:15.685 --> 17:17.819
so you can have your own thing.

17:26.219 --> 17:28.830
Wow, you get to publish
your own comic book too?

17:28.873 --> 17:33.574
Yeah, right?
So should I sign you up?

17:35.489 --> 17:37.186
But what if I go
and it's terrible?

17:37.230 --> 17:41.103
But what if you go
and it's wonderful?

17:42.670 --> 17:45.803
Baby, you'll never know
what's out there for you

17:45.847 --> 17:48.067
if you don't step away
from your brother.

17:50.765 --> 17:52.158
So what do you want to do?

17:59.165 --> 18:01.254
Mm.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.473
I'm good.

18:05.693 --> 18:08.130
Yo, Kenan!
Let's work on your lines.

18:16.399 --> 18:17.748
Damn.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.622
<i>Gary?</i>

18:21.665 --> 18:23.189
<i>Baby, you still there?</i>

18:24.886 --> 18:27.149
Yeah. I'm still here.

18:27.193 --> 18:30.239
<i>Baby, all this ranting</i> <i>
and raving that you're doing,</i>

18:30.283 --> 18:32.807
<i>it's not about my house</i> <i>
or Kenan's house</i>

18:32.850 --> 18:34.287
<i>or where you gonna</i> <i>
put your stuff.</i>

18:34.330 --> 18:36.854
<i>It's about you not having</i> <i>
something for yourself.</i>

18:41.729 --> 18:44.645
What am I supposed
to do, Ma?

18:44.688 --> 18:47.430
How am I supposed
to change things now?

18:47.474 --> 18:49.084
<i>Oh, sweetie.</i>

18:49.128 --> 18:51.695
<i>If you want things</i> <i>
to be different,</i>

18:51.739 --> 18:54.220

<i>[somber music]</i>

18:57.266 --> 19:04.186

19:05.970 --> 19:08.669
- Now, Janay...
- Mm.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.584
You know you my lady,

19:10.627 --> 19:12.760
and you know I care about you.

19:12.803 --> 19:15.850
And if you
really care about me,

19:15.893 --> 19:18.026
then you'll take some
of Gary's boxes to your house.

19:18.069 --> 19:19.854
Uh, please.

19:19.897 --> 19:22.204
Have you gone crazy?
Because this is crazy.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.337
What you talking about?
He's family.

19:24.380 --> 19:26.904
Right. So say no, he'll hold
a grudge for a few years,

19:26.948 --> 19:29.080
and then he'll forgive you
when he needs a kidney.

19:29.124 --> 19:30.038
Come on, baby.

19:30.081 --> 19:31.561
He's having a really hard time

19:31.605 --> 19:33.868
with this house sale business.

19:33.911 --> 19:36.131
I tried some tough love,
but I think it broke him.

19:36.175 --> 19:39.439
I do too.
He is not in a good place.

19:39.482 --> 19:40.875
Nah.

19:40.918 --> 19:42.920
Hey, Kenan,
can I talk to you for a second?

19:42.964 --> 19:44.226
Oh.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.446
Look at them sad eyes.

19:46.489 --> 19:49.840
Okay, how about you two
give these guys some space?

19:49.884 --> 19:52.321
I'll wait for you inside.
- Thank you.

19:52.365 --> 19:54.280
Hey, so look, man,
I'm, like, this close

19:54.323 --> 19:55.846
to figuring out how you can
hold on to your

19:55.890 --> 19:57.935
keepsakes and whatnot.
- Nah, man, I was tripping.

19:57.979 --> 20:00.460
All that was about me
being too comfortable

20:00.503 --> 20:02.244
living in your shadow, man.

20:02.288 --> 20:03.941
You're not in my shadow
just because

20:03.985 --> 20:05.856
you live in my house
and manage my career

20:05.900 --> 20:07.902
and your only other client
is my coworker.

20:07.945 --> 20:08.990
Damn, you literally are--

20:09.033 --> 20:11.558
I'm getting my own place,
dog.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.560
- What?
- I'm getting my own place.

20:13.603 --> 20:14.952
Gary, you don't
have to do that.

20:14.996 --> 20:16.606
Janay is gonna take, like,
five boxes,

20:16.650 --> 20:17.694
and when I put that thang
on her later,

20:17.738 --> 20:19.087
she gonna take eight.

20:19.130 --> 20:22.830
And as foolproof
as that plan is, bro,

20:22.873 --> 20:24.919
nah, man, it's time
for me to step out

20:24.962 --> 20:26.573
and make some things happen,
you know?

20:26.616 --> 20:28.052
Make a home of my own.

20:31.012 --> 20:33.406
- I hear ya.
- And look, don't worry, man.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.190
It's gonna take a few months,
and even when I'm gone,

20:35.234 --> 20:37.148
I'll still be back over
for most meals and to hang out

20:37.192 --> 20:39.586
because baby steps,
fam, you know?

20:39.629 --> 20:42.937
Well, whatever you need,
I'll always be here for you.

20:42.980 --> 20:44.330
You know that.
- I know.

20:44.373 --> 20:46.767
Man, I've always known that,
but I think it's time

20:46.810 --> 20:48.159
I rely on myself
for a little while, you know,

20:48.203 --> 20:49.639
see how that goes.

20:49.683 --> 20:50.858
You better get
some extra bedrooms

20:50.901 --> 20:52.642
for your light bulbs
and nasty magazines.

20:52.686 --> 20:54.122
[chuckles]

20:54.165 --> 20:55.602
Nah, man, I'm throwing
all that junk out, bro.

20:55.645 --> 20:58.996
Got a laptop anyway.
More options.

20:59.040 --> 21:00.781
Black Goonies has never die.

21:00.824 --> 21:02.043
Never, bro.

21:06.395 --> 21:09.529
Wait, did that movie
ever get a release date?

21:09.572 --> 21:11.313
No, NAACP shut that down.

21:11.357 --> 21:12.662
Yeah, sounds about right,
yeah.

21:12.706 --> 21:13.968
It was bad.

21:14.011 --> 21:16.231
