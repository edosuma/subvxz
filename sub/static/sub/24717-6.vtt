WEBVTT

00:04.287 --> 00:08.319
It is America's most
infamous military installation.

00:08.474 --> 00:11.339
For decades,
witnesses in that area

00:11.494 --> 00:15.272
are seeing unusual craft
hovering over the base.

00:15.447 --> 00:17.825
The place
where top secret experiments,

00:17.881 --> 00:20.605
involving alien technology,

00:20.681 --> 00:23.532
are rumored to be taking place.

00:23.707 --> 00:27.052
There is extraterrestrial
technology at Area 51.

00:27.061 --> 00:29.952
But is Area 51 still viable,

00:30.061 --> 00:32.598
now that the top secret is out?

00:32.753 --> 00:34.303
This underground
expansion has stretched

00:34.327 --> 00:36.665
all the way through Nevada
into Utah.

00:36.821 --> 00:41.139
Or do other,
even more covert places exist,

00:41.314 --> 00:44.079
where mankind's
extraterrestrial future

00:44.121 --> 00:46.232
is being prepared?

00:46.321 --> 00:50.632
Where are Areas 52, 53, and 54?

Langley, Virginia.

01:22.734 --> 01:26.432
August 15, 2013.

01:26.521 --> 01:30.659
After decades of secrecy,
denials and cover-ups,

01:30.814 --> 01:33.845
the CIA declassifies documents

01:33.901 --> 01:35.979
which acknowledge the existence

01:36.001 --> 01:38.685
of a top secret military
research facility

01:38.741 --> 01:41.792
known as Area 51.

01:41.967 --> 01:44.812
This was an historic
announcement.

01:44.814 --> 01:47.359
Finally, these years of rumors

01:47.514 --> 01:50.679
that the UFO community and the
conspiracy theory community

01:50.834 --> 01:54.445
had been claiming to be true
had been validated.

01:54.621 --> 01:57.285
The federal government
was forced to acknowledge

01:57.361 --> 01:59.732
the existence
of the Area 51 base

01:59.734 --> 02:02.252
because of a Freedom
of Information Act request.

02:02.361 --> 02:05.139
It took them over a decade
to actually respond,

02:05.141 --> 02:07.057
but in the end,
they eventually had to admit

02:07.081 --> 02:08.519
what everybody already knew,

02:08.520 --> 02:10.176
which was that
Area 51 did exist.

02:10.201 --> 02:13.339
Since 1955,

02:13.361 --> 02:15.600
this top secret base,

02:15.775 --> 02:18.766
located in the remote desert
of southern Nevada,

02:18.768 --> 02:21.100
has been considered
the epicenter

02:21.122 --> 02:24.026
of the military's
most classified projects,

02:24.182 --> 02:26.333
from the U-2 spy plane

02:26.488 --> 02:29.366
to the F-117 stealth fighter.

02:29.422 --> 02:30.946
But many believe

02:31.002 --> 02:33.786
that in the darkest corners
of Area 51

02:33.942 --> 02:36.893
lurks an even bigger secret...

02:36.895 --> 02:38.906
One that hides
the ultimate evidence

02:39.082 --> 02:42.600
of extraterrestrial contact.

02:45.282 --> 02:49.500
While the admission that
Area 51 existed was important,

02:49.522 --> 02:51.893
it didn't go far enough
for many people

02:52.048 --> 02:54.460
who were hoping that the
government was going to confirm

02:54.502 --> 02:57.113
all the rumors
about crashed UFOs

02:57.202 --> 02:59.733
and recovered
alien technology were true.

02:59.888 --> 03:02.733
But the government
said nothing about that.

03:02.735 --> 03:07.353
They only gave us
the exact minimal amount

03:07.355 --> 03:08.940
of information
that was requested.

03:08.962 --> 03:11.053
They did not give us
any more information.

03:11.055 --> 03:13.158
And they certainly appear
to still be covering up

03:13.182 --> 03:16.546
what exactly goes on at Area 51.

03:16.702 --> 03:18.626
Over the years,

03:18.782 --> 03:20.540
there have been a number
of claims by people

03:20.562 --> 03:22.484
who have been
associated with Area 51

03:22.508 --> 03:24.748
who have spoken to journalists
or whistle-blowers

03:24.822 --> 03:27.626
in which they have stated,
quite explicitly,

03:27.702 --> 03:31.340
that there is extraterrestrial
technology at Area 51.

03:31.495 --> 03:36.960
The theory was that they
had hired propulsion experts,

03:37.002 --> 03:39.833
engineers, physicists,

03:39.988 --> 03:44.293
to reverse engineer
alien propulsion technology,

03:44.468 --> 03:46.760
which was so far
in advance of ours,

03:46.802 --> 03:48.973
and they were doing that
at Area 51.

03:48.975 --> 03:53.000
We also have rumors
that there are alien spacecraft

03:53.175 --> 03:55.840
on the base that have actually
been tested and flown

03:55.995 --> 03:57.713
out of Area 51.

03:57.802 --> 04:01.520
Is it possible
that scientists at Area 51

04:01.675 --> 04:04.853
have been able
to not merely study,

04:05.008 --> 04:07.080
but successfully
reverse engineer

04:07.235 --> 04:09.393
an extraterrestrial craft?

04:09.548 --> 04:13.366
For 30 years, people have gone

04:13.522 --> 04:17.745
to the perimeter
with binoculars, telescopes.

04:17.902 --> 04:21.220
They've seen bright objects
moving in angular motions,

04:21.242 --> 04:22.880
or zigzag motions,

04:23.035 --> 04:25.586
and in ways that seem to be
well beyond anything

04:25.588 --> 04:27.446
that we have ever seen,

04:27.502 --> 04:30.720
and propulsion technology
that's not readily identifiable.

04:30.875 --> 04:34.266
But if Area 51

04:34.268 --> 04:36.420
is the place where
the U.S. government

04:36.595 --> 04:38.915
is conducting its most top
secret military research,

04:39.088 --> 04:42.353
and possibly hiding
decades of evidence

04:42.355 --> 04:44.286
concerning alien contact,

04:44.362 --> 04:47.040
just how secret is it now?

04:47.062 --> 04:50.520
If everyone knows that it exists

04:50.522 --> 04:52.693
and what kind of work
is done there,

04:52.848 --> 04:55.153
could Area 51
have outlived its purpose

04:55.242 --> 04:59.220
as a strategic military asset?

04:59.375 --> 05:04.366
In search of the answers,
ancient astronaut theorist

05:04.368 --> 05:08.140
Giorgio Tsoukalos has traveled
to Henderson, Nevada.

05:08.162 --> 05:09.866
- Hello. Great to meet you.
- Hello.

05:09.868 --> 05:12.149
He has arranged
to meet with TD Barnes,

05:12.222 --> 05:14.546
a former electrical engineer

05:14.548 --> 05:16.893
who worked on classified
military projects

05:16.895 --> 05:20.520
at Area 51 for more
than four decades.

05:26.762 --> 05:28.826
- Only in 2009.
- Yeah, 2009.

05:29.002 --> 05:31.042
And when did you start
your work there?

05:33.135 --> 05:34.778
So almost 50 years

05:34.802 --> 05:36.802
you kept it a secret
from your wife.

05:38.455 --> 05:39.860
And what did you work on?

05:41.942 --> 05:43.960
Okay.

05:44.135 --> 05:45.255
Let's hypothetically say

05:45.302 --> 05:47.386
that a UFO crashes

05:47.562 --> 05:49.773
and you get ahold of it.

05:49.928 --> 05:52.920
Would we be able to reverse
engineer that technology?

06:12.308 --> 06:13.766
Wow.

06:13.942 --> 06:15.982
I mean, for all
intents and purposes,

06:16.035 --> 06:18.886
that was a secret space program.

06:19.042 --> 06:20.520
Do you think that this

06:20.675 --> 06:23.400
secret space program
stills exists today?

06:33.988 --> 06:36.946
Okay. Now, while you
were working there,

06:37.102 --> 06:39.920
did you ever see anything weird
up in the sky?

06:48.083 --> 06:49.601
Wow.

06:49.756 --> 06:52.881
In your estimation, when you
read these stories about

06:52.883 --> 06:55.987
some companies trying
to develop a warp drive,

06:56.143 --> 06:59.754
or even an antimatter
propulsion system,

06:59.756 --> 07:02.321
is this something
actually achievable?

07:14.689 --> 07:15.769
Ah, that's tremendous.

07:15.929 --> 07:19.534
But if, as TD Barnes suggests,

07:19.709 --> 07:21.207
the military has successfully

07:21.263 --> 07:24.241
reverse engineered anti-gravity

07:24.263 --> 07:27.681
and flying saucer technologies
at Area 51,

07:27.836 --> 07:31.021
what are they working on now?

07:31.176 --> 07:34.081
And if its purpose
is still to operate

07:34.236 --> 07:35.952
as the government's
most highly classified,

07:35.976 --> 07:38.501
top secret laboratory,

07:38.523 --> 07:42.121
why would they admit
to the existence of Area 51?

07:42.276 --> 07:46.467
Especially after decades
of silence?

07:46.643 --> 07:50.134
One possibility about
the public announcement

07:50.136 --> 07:52.321
that Area 51 exists,

07:52.496 --> 07:55.581
is that the real action
has moved elsewhere.

07:55.736 --> 07:59.261
In other words, the CIA,

07:59.416 --> 08:01.801
the government,
only felt able to come clean

08:01.956 --> 08:04.314
about this because
the real secrets

08:04.316 --> 08:06.547
have been moved somewhere else.

08:06.549 --> 08:08.641
So in a real sense, perhaps,

08:08.796 --> 08:12.394
the question isn't so much
what's going on at Area 51,

08:12.403 --> 08:17.081
but what's going on
at Area 52, 53, and 54?

08:17.103 --> 08:19.967
Area 52? 53?

08:20.123 --> 08:21.734
And 54?

08:21.909 --> 08:23.887
Might there really be other,

08:23.943 --> 08:27.314
even more secret locations,

08:27.469 --> 08:30.134
where the government
is continuing to study

08:30.289 --> 08:33.573
and replicate
extraterrestrial technology?

08:33.729 --> 08:36.881
Having one big place

08:37.035 --> 08:39.094
where everybody
is doing the research

08:39.249 --> 08:40.927
is not a good idea

08:40.929 --> 08:44.114
because it would be hard to hide
from the general public.

08:44.222 --> 08:47.761
So the idea that there
might be any single, individual

08:47.763 --> 08:51.234
Area 51 where they're reverse
engineering alien spacecraft,

08:51.236 --> 08:53.934
now, that seems a little bit
an outdated concept.

08:54.089 --> 08:55.934
If I were going to do it,

08:56.089 --> 08:58.569
I would spread the technology
pieces out across the country.

09:00.516 --> 09:02.719
Is it possible that
the reason government officials

09:02.743 --> 09:06.414
revealed the existence
of Area 51

09:06.569 --> 09:09.827
is because they want
to use it as a decoy?

09:09.829 --> 09:12.581
One that takes the focus away
from their other,

09:12.736 --> 09:15.134
perhaps even bigger, operations

09:15.289 --> 09:19.054
at numerous sites
all across the United States?

09:19.056 --> 09:21.141
So the fact that
they would finally admit

09:21.296 --> 09:23.841
that Area 51 exists is actually,
to my mind, a smoke screen.

09:23.996 --> 09:25.845
What's really going on
is that you've got

09:25.869 --> 09:27.989
all these massive
underground facilities.

09:28.016 --> 09:30.221
You can take all
the really good stuff

09:30.223 --> 09:32.272
you don't want anybody
to see and simply

09:32.296 --> 09:36.414
move it somewhere else
in the blink of an eye.

09:36.416 --> 09:39.034
While the public
remains focused on what is

09:39.036 --> 09:43.061
or isn't happening at Area 51,

09:43.063 --> 09:45.434
could the government
be hiding its research

09:45.523 --> 09:47.567
into extraterrestrial technology

09:47.569 --> 09:50.307
at other strategic sites

09:50.463 --> 09:53.227
all across the country?

09:53.283 --> 09:54.927
Perhaps the answer can be found

09:55.003 --> 09:57.707
by investigating reports
of an extensive

09:57.709 --> 10:00.334
tunneling operation
currently underway

10:00.489 --> 10:06.954
in the Nevada desert.

10:07.109 --> 10:08.545
Witnesses
are looking out, and even.

10:08.569 --> 10:12.661
March 17, 2018.

10:12.683 --> 10:15.547
Just outside the perimeter
of Area 51,

10:15.703 --> 10:18.614
Giorgio Tsoukalos

10:18.616 --> 10:21.321
meets with researcher
Wolf McCarron

10:21.363 --> 10:24.174
and mining expert
Christian Gronau.

10:24.349 --> 10:26.141
They are here
to investigate rumors

10:26.143 --> 10:30.847
of an alleged tunnel network
that lies beneath Area 51.

10:31.003 --> 10:33.374
- This is amazing.
- Isn't it?

10:33.376 --> 10:35.587
Wolf and Christian believe

10:35.589 --> 10:37.987
this location...
the Tempiute Mine...

10:38.043 --> 10:41.187
is one of several old Nevada
mines that have been used

10:41.243 --> 10:43.954
to expand operations at Area 51,

10:44.109 --> 10:47.114
deep underground.

10:47.289 --> 10:51.481
I'm a miner, about 100 miles
north of Area 51 here,

10:51.636 --> 10:54.874
and I've been mining there
since 1992.

10:55.049 --> 10:57.074
I also own a mine in Goldfield.

10:57.076 --> 11:01.041
So I'm just an avid miner,
you know... I search these out.

11:01.063 --> 11:03.654
So what can you tell us
about Area 51?

11:03.656 --> 11:06.867
Well, Area 51, what you see,

11:06.869 --> 11:11.428
like, on Google Imagery, that
was the '50s, '60s and '70s.

11:11.584 --> 11:13.855
Since then, they've gone down.

11:13.944 --> 11:15.904
Everything they do
is underground.

11:15.964 --> 11:18.202
And what evidence

11:18.357 --> 11:20.575
have you come across as a miner

11:20.730 --> 11:23.248
that would corroborate
your idea?

11:23.404 --> 11:25.280
People are questioning, well,
if they're going down,

11:25.304 --> 11:26.982
where is all the dirt going?

11:27.137 --> 11:29.033
Well, it's going
to these nearby mines,

11:29.057 --> 11:30.546
and they're putting it
in huge mountains,

11:30.570 --> 11:31.908
and they're heap leaching it.

11:32.064 --> 11:33.226
And by the time they're done

11:33.250 --> 11:34.473
heap leaching a huge mountain,

11:34.497 --> 11:36.022
it goes down to nothing.

11:36.177 --> 11:37.202
Now, to the uninitiated,

11:37.224 --> 11:38.942
what does heap leaching mean?

11:39.117 --> 11:40.902
It is... they pile the ore up

11:41.077 --> 11:43.662
into a large mountain,
hundreds of feet high,

11:43.684 --> 11:48.402
and they run hoses all the way
through it, like every two feet,

11:48.557 --> 11:52.862
and they leach in mercury
and cyanide.

11:53.017 --> 11:56.202
And what that does,
it'll take boulders this large

11:56.357 --> 11:57.786
and actually just bring them
down to nothing.

11:57.810 --> 11:59.388
Really?

11:59.564 --> 12:00.564
Yeah.

12:01.997 --> 12:04.342
Is the government
using heap leaching

12:04.497 --> 12:08.428
inside the Tempiute Mine
in order to hide

12:08.430 --> 12:10.842
the massive amounts of dirt
being removed

12:10.997 --> 12:13.835
in the course of their
digging operations?

12:13.924 --> 12:17.715
But if so, how is the government
able to conduct

12:17.870 --> 12:21.595
such an enormous operation
without arousing the suspicion

12:21.750 --> 12:23.982
of the local miners?

12:24.137 --> 12:28.482
These mines around here
have gold, silver, lead.

12:28.637 --> 12:31.382
So any mine would be more than
happy to accept the ore.

12:31.537 --> 12:33.493
And it's kinda like
hush-up money.

12:33.517 --> 12:36.775
I've witnessed this hush up
and dealt with this a lot.

12:36.930 --> 12:38.675
Hush up of what?

12:38.830 --> 12:42.842
Hush up of the base
and the tunnels of Area 51.

12:42.864 --> 12:44.455
Okay.

12:44.630 --> 12:46.968
It's sort of self-explanatory
that the reason

12:46.970 --> 12:51.162
why people would go underground
is if there are experiments

12:51.164 --> 12:53.622
going on that there's
no interference,

12:53.624 --> 12:54.704
or less interference.

12:54.757 --> 12:56.142
Exactly. Yeah.

12:58.144 --> 13:00.064
Has the U.S. military

13:00.150 --> 13:04.295
been expanding its operations
at Area 51 not outward,

13:04.404 --> 13:06.122
but downward,

13:06.277 --> 13:08.482
in order to keep
its top secret work

13:08.484 --> 13:11.282
even more secret than before?

13:13.237 --> 13:14.482
It is my own belief,

13:14.637 --> 13:16.555
based on a lot of good research,

13:16.730 --> 13:19.635
that there is most likely
a large...

13:19.637 --> 13:22.615
I would even say vast... web
of interconnected,

13:22.704 --> 13:25.815
underground bases and tunnels
that exist.

13:25.924 --> 13:29.042
They originally started doing
it, by the way,

13:29.044 --> 13:31.688
just to protect against
an atomic strike

13:31.844 --> 13:33.793
that could've happened
from the Soviet Union.

13:33.817 --> 13:35.660
And you need secure
underground facilities.

13:35.684 --> 13:37.804
Well, they took that
and just ran with it.

13:40.464 --> 13:42.306
There are those that believe

13:42.330 --> 13:46.248
that the underground operations
being conducted at Area 51

13:46.404 --> 13:49.862
are only the tip
of an enormous iceberg.

13:50.017 --> 13:53.768
Is it just one of many secret
government facilities,

13:53.924 --> 13:56.808
each connected to each other
by a vast network

13:56.864 --> 14:00.382
of underground
high-speed trains?

14:00.404 --> 14:03.035
An underground train system

14:03.190 --> 14:06.235
is said to be centered
around Cheyenne Mountain

14:06.390 --> 14:07.922
in Colorado Springs.

14:07.964 --> 14:10.822
This is a mountain
that has been hollowed out

14:10.824 --> 14:12.202
by the U.S. military.

14:12.377 --> 14:15.202
It's the NORAD
central command.

14:15.204 --> 14:18.815
And they go from Cheyenne
Mountain, in Colorado Springs,

14:18.970 --> 14:21.595
to Dulce, New Mexico,
which is said to have

14:21.750 --> 14:24.668
an extraterrestrial
underground base.

14:24.824 --> 14:28.075
Then it goes to Los Alamos,
in New Mexico,

14:28.230 --> 14:30.755
then to Albuquerque,
and to Roswell,

14:30.930 --> 14:33.948
and to Area 51, in Nevada.

14:33.950 --> 14:38.262
All of these military bases
are essentially connected

14:38.417 --> 14:42.122
by a secret underground
subway system.

14:45.837 --> 14:48.982
The folks who are
looking at Area 51,

14:49.004 --> 14:51.322
they're not looking at Dulce.

14:51.324 --> 14:56.042
Dulce, New Mexico, is on
Jicarilla Apache Reservation.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.928
It's actually a separate entity.

14:59.930 --> 15:01.402
It's part of the Apache Nation.

15:01.424 --> 15:04.622
In other words,
you can't just go there.

15:04.777 --> 15:09.628
There is a peak just
north of the town of Dulce

15:09.784 --> 15:11.922
called Archuleta Peak.

15:11.944 --> 15:17.868
And residents of Dulce claim
to have seen UFOs

15:17.870 --> 15:21.622
coming in and out
of that mountain.

15:21.777 --> 15:23.553
The U.S. government is saying
that there's nothing there...

15:23.577 --> 15:25.246
they have no military
base there,

15:25.270 --> 15:27.815
there's not some underground
train network.

15:27.817 --> 15:30.255
And yet,
people who live there say

15:30.257 --> 15:32.222
there is something
going on here.

15:32.244 --> 15:35.869
So, just like Area 51,
where the government was saying,

15:35.871 --> 15:37.909
hey, there's
nothing going on here,

15:38.065 --> 15:41.369
but researchers for decades knew
and investigated things

15:41.425 --> 15:43.269
that were going on there.

15:43.425 --> 15:47.256
And so perhaps at Dulce,
one day, they will admit...

15:47.411 --> 15:49.663
yes, something was
going on there.

15:49.818 --> 15:52.469
Is there really a vast network

15:52.471 --> 15:54.549
of top secret government
laboratories,

15:54.705 --> 15:56.656
each conducting experiments

15:56.658 --> 15:59.776
using extraterrestrial
technology?

15:59.951 --> 16:01.434
For ancient astronaut theorists,

16:01.458 --> 16:04.423
the answer is a profound yes.

16:04.445 --> 16:07.243
And they offer,
as additional proof,

16:07.398 --> 16:11.556
not one located at a facility
in the American southwest

16:11.558 --> 16:14.283
but one much farther
to the east.

16:14.458 --> 16:17.983
A military base they claim
has been working directly

16:18.138 --> 16:20.569
with extraterrestrials
for decades

16:20.725 --> 16:24.036
and operating very close
to the location

16:24.038 --> 16:27.196
where mankind made its first
successful effort

16:27.198 --> 16:29.843
to reach the sky.

16:36.411 --> 16:39.007
We actually have an eyewitness
NARRATOR: Dayton, Ohio.

16:39.031 --> 16:43.076
Here, on the very same plains
where Wilbur and Orville Wright

16:43.231 --> 16:46.316
lifted mankind
into the era of flight,

16:46.318 --> 16:48.756
sits Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base,

16:48.758 --> 16:51.929
one of the largest
and highest-funded bases

16:52.105 --> 16:55.229
in the nation's military.

16:55.285 --> 16:58.423
It is up there as one
of the single most important

16:58.578 --> 17:02.016
military, technology,
back-engineering study

17:02.018 --> 17:06.803
in biological entities
of any place we have.

17:08.657 --> 17:10.656
For ancient astronaut theorists,

17:10.657 --> 17:12.996
Wright-Patterson...
or Wright-Patt,

17:12.998 --> 17:15.236
as it is more commonly called...

17:15.238 --> 17:18.269
has been a hub of
extraterrestrial investigation

17:18.271 --> 17:21.516
and experimentation for decades.

17:21.671 --> 17:25.803
Some even consider it
of greater strategic importance

17:25.825 --> 17:27.203
than Area 51.

17:27.358 --> 17:29.876
So, the rumors and stories

17:29.878 --> 17:31.576
of aliens at Wright-Patt

17:31.731 --> 17:34.743
have been very widespread
for a very long period of time.

17:34.898 --> 17:38.129
And there have also been claims
that unknown aerial vehicles

17:38.131 --> 17:41.343
or UFOs are being stored
deep underground.

17:44.671 --> 17:47.876
On June 14, 1947,

17:47.878 --> 17:51.716
an unidentified object
reportedly crashed on a farm

17:51.871 --> 17:54.956
outside the town
of Roswell, New Mexico.

17:55.111 --> 17:57.429
According to eyewitnesses,

17:57.485 --> 18:00.896
the object resembled
some sort of flying disc,

18:01.051 --> 18:03.356
and the bodies recovered
from the wreckage

18:03.445 --> 18:06.629
looked like nothing
from this planet.

18:06.705 --> 18:10.476
Within days,
the so-called Roswell incident

18:10.651 --> 18:12.429
captured the imaginations

18:12.605 --> 18:16.189
of millions of people
around the world.

18:16.345 --> 18:17.889
But just as the event

18:17.965 --> 18:21.376
jump-started America's interest
in UFOs,

18:21.465 --> 18:24.463
it also ushered in the era
of the government cover-up.

18:26.758 --> 18:29.203
The Roswell Base
issued a press release,

18:29.205 --> 18:31.983
and then several hours later,
it's all denied.

18:32.158 --> 18:33.901
"Sorry, people,
just a weather balloon.

18:33.925 --> 18:35.716
"Our top intelligence officers

18:35.871 --> 18:37.236
didn't know what
they were looking at."

18:37.238 --> 18:39.123
And we actually have evidence

18:39.145 --> 18:41.001
of an FBI memo
that made such a statement,

18:41.025 --> 18:42.669
that what was recovered

18:42.725 --> 18:46.243
was being brought
to Wright Field for analysis.

18:46.398 --> 18:48.454
Well, you're not going to bring
balloon parts

18:48.478 --> 18:51.503
to Wright Field for analysis.
That's not going to happen.

18:51.658 --> 18:53.936
You've got
to remember that in 1947

18:53.938 --> 18:55.736
when the Roswell crash happened,

18:55.891 --> 18:58.463
there was no Area 51 in Nevada.

18:58.618 --> 19:01.083
And in fact, the important
Air Force headquarters

19:01.238 --> 19:06.083
to study these crashed artifacts
and possibly alien bodies

19:06.258 --> 19:09.556
was Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio.

19:09.558 --> 19:12.643
Now, the reason
that this wreckage

19:12.798 --> 19:15.343
would have been sent to
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base

19:15.518 --> 19:17.316
is because at that time,

19:17.318 --> 19:19.429
it was the center
of the Air Force's

19:19.431 --> 19:21.736
Foreign Technology Division,
meaning the division

19:21.738 --> 19:24.496
that actually studied
foreign aircraft,

19:24.498 --> 19:26.458
foreign technologies
of all kinds,

19:26.518 --> 19:28.683
and certainly alien tech,

19:28.838 --> 19:31.103
wrecked alien spacecrafts

19:31.105 --> 19:33.876
and report
of alien spacecraft sightings

19:33.878 --> 19:35.407
would be sent there
to be studied

19:35.431 --> 19:37.354
by the Foreign
Technology Division.

19:37.378 --> 19:38.874
Is it possible

19:38.898 --> 19:40.923
that Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base

19:41.078 --> 19:43.843
is still housing the remains
of the object

19:43.998 --> 19:48.389
recovered from the New Mexico
desert more than 70 years ago?

19:48.545 --> 19:51.476
And if so,
could there be evidence

19:51.478 --> 19:54.683
that their efforts to recreate
the so-called flying disc

19:54.838 --> 19:56.643
have been successful?

19:58.951 --> 20:02.224
Even now, in the last few years,

20:02.399 --> 20:05.744
there have been important
UFO sightings around Dayton.

20:05.919 --> 20:08.324
And witnesses in that area

20:08.479 --> 20:10.864
are looking out over
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base

20:11.019 --> 20:14.077
and, even in broad daylight,

20:14.252 --> 20:17.644
seeing unusual craft
hovering over the base.

20:17.646 --> 20:19.142
This is a very distinct
possibility

20:19.166 --> 20:21.270
that's supported by the fact

20:21.272 --> 20:24.450
that no jets are released
when these UFOs appear.

20:24.606 --> 20:26.208
It's almost as if they know
what they are.

20:26.232 --> 20:27.804
Maybe it's because

20:27.959 --> 20:30.504
it's one of our own
reverse engineered craft.

20:33.072 --> 20:37.330
But even if the UFOs
recently sighted in the skies

20:37.486 --> 20:40.084
above Wright-Patterson
are man-made,

20:40.106 --> 20:42.644
couldn't that be
considered proof

20:42.799 --> 20:45.510
that the UFO
that crash-landed near Roswell

20:45.566 --> 20:49.090
was, in fact,
reverse engineered?

20:49.246 --> 20:53.770
Ancient astronaut theorists say
yes, and to support their claim,

20:53.826 --> 20:57.164
they point to two other
top secret UFO investigations

20:57.319 --> 20:59.850
that took place
at Wright-Patterson:

20:59.906 --> 21:04.484
Project Sign
and Project Blue Book.

21:04.506 --> 21:06.522
Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base was the center,

21:06.546 --> 21:09.977
the hub, for Project Sign
and Project Blue Book.

21:10.132 --> 21:12.570
Now, both of these projects
were involved

21:12.572 --> 21:14.424
with one essential task,

21:14.579 --> 21:18.317
which was the study and
categorization of reports

21:18.319 --> 21:20.637
of unidentified flying objects.

21:20.726 --> 21:22.568
Project Sign was set up

21:22.592 --> 21:26.024
after the flying saucer
wave of sightings

21:26.179 --> 21:29.577
across the United States
in 1947,

21:29.732 --> 21:32.097
and shortly after
the Roswell crash.

21:32.206 --> 21:36.190
Sign researched
and investigated the phenomenon,

21:36.192 --> 21:38.664
taking reports,
not just from the public,

21:38.819 --> 21:41.937
but from the military, from
pilots who were seeing things,

21:42.112 --> 21:45.497
from radar operators
who were tracking these objects.

21:45.652 --> 21:49.830
This was the U.S. government's
formal UFO program.

21:49.832 --> 21:52.630
The Air Force had
22 years of UFO investigation

21:52.786 --> 21:55.084
that was housed in
the Foreign Technology Division,

21:55.259 --> 21:57.339
and Blue Book
is the most famous and ran

21:57.379 --> 21:59.130
for the longest period of time.

21:59.132 --> 22:01.557
They go out and they look
for foreign technology,

22:01.732 --> 22:04.437
including crashed wreckage.

22:04.446 --> 22:06.030
And then, they have access

22:06.032 --> 22:08.944
to all of the technical
expertise on the base.

22:09.099 --> 22:13.524
In 1969,
after compiling and studying

22:13.679 --> 22:16.357
more than 12,000 UFO sightings,

22:16.446 --> 22:19.557
Project Blue Book
was terminated.

22:19.666 --> 22:22.110
Most of the sightings
were categorized

22:22.266 --> 22:26.950
as high-altitude spy planes
or natural aerial phenomena,

22:27.006 --> 22:32.204
although approximately 700
unidentified cases still remain.

22:35.159 --> 22:39.064
But while the U.S. Air Force
insists to this day

22:39.239 --> 22:42.077
that credible evidence
of extraterrestrial visitation

22:42.079 --> 22:43.997
never existed,

22:43.999 --> 22:47.124
many former employees of
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,

22:47.146 --> 22:49.044
such as Ray Szymanski,

22:49.066 --> 22:54.090
have come forward
with a very different story.

22:54.146 --> 22:57.957
I started working at Wright-
Patterson in January of 1973,

22:57.959 --> 22:59.488
and I had 38 years and nine
months of service

22:59.512 --> 23:01.557
when I retired.

23:01.559 --> 23:05.010
I spent nearly my entire career
at Air Force Research Labs,

23:05.086 --> 23:08.850
and I did advanced research
and development.

23:08.926 --> 23:10.477
On the first day of working
there, I had a mentor.

23:10.479 --> 23:11.844
His name was Corvette Al.

23:11.999 --> 23:13.982
He was the equivalent
of a flag officer,

23:14.006 --> 23:15.724
a general or an admiral,

23:15.899 --> 23:17.477
and he said,
"Let's go through the hangar,"

23:17.479 --> 23:19.202
and as we stepped
into that hangar,

23:19.226 --> 23:20.557
he turned to me and said,

23:20.559 --> 23:22.710
"Have you heard
about our aliens?"

23:22.766 --> 23:24.410
I said, "What?"

23:24.566 --> 23:26.122
He said, "Yeah, we have
aliens here on the base."

23:26.146 --> 23:28.124
I said, "Really?"

23:28.279 --> 23:30.695
And then, he said, "Well, yeah,
there was a crash out west",

23:30.719 --> 23:32.697
and they brought the aliens
and their machine."

23:32.699 --> 23:34.490
He used the word "machine."

23:34.646 --> 23:36.510
Brought here to Wright-Patterson
for evaluation

23:36.512 --> 23:40.097
and possible exploitation.

23:40.272 --> 23:44.010
Hangar 18 was this mysterious
hangar at Wright Field where

23:44.012 --> 23:49.497
we actually have an eyewitness
who was taken to Hangar 18,

23:49.586 --> 23:51.677
Lieutenant Colonel
Marion Magruder.

23:51.832 --> 23:54.232
He was a fighter pilot in
the United States Marine Corps

23:54.312 --> 23:56.710
who saw the alien technology,

23:56.712 --> 24:02.144
but worse,
he saw the live alien.

24:02.319 --> 24:04.130
It looked human,

24:04.132 --> 24:06.035
its head was larger
than humans',

24:06.059 --> 24:07.557
its arms were much longer,

24:07.712 --> 24:10.637
and it moved like this
in a wavy motion.

24:10.726 --> 24:15.177
The humanoid communicated
with Magruder telepathically,

24:15.266 --> 24:18.090
and the Army and the Air Force,

24:18.246 --> 24:21.297
as well as the higher branches
of the Pentagon,

24:21.299 --> 24:24.404
were absolutely fascinated
by the fact that here

24:24.559 --> 24:29.665
were creatures who could
communicate without using words.

24:29.667 --> 24:33.805
Thus began a series of
experiments into psychokinesis,

24:33.847 --> 24:38.898
psychic projection,
thought projection.

24:39.053 --> 24:41.445
If the Magruder
account is true,

24:41.467 --> 24:44.091
and the U.S. military

24:44.093 --> 24:46.333
was once using live aliens
for scientific study,

24:46.380 --> 24:48.871
where did those experiments
take place?

24:49.027 --> 24:51.085
Was it at Wright-Patterson?

24:51.107 --> 24:53.165
Area 51?

24:53.187 --> 24:55.898
Or were they conducted
at yet another facility?

24:55.907 --> 24:57.825
And, if so, where?

24:58.000 --> 25:01.365
And are they still
taking place today?

25:12.153 --> 25:15.018
Here, at the eastern tip
of the island,

25:15.020 --> 25:18.865
is all that remains of
the Montauk Air Force Station.

25:18.887 --> 25:23.191
Originally established
as a naval base in 1917

25:23.367 --> 25:25.965
due to its strategic
defensive location,

25:26.140 --> 25:29.265
the Montauk installation
protected the East Coast

25:29.267 --> 25:31.225
from submarines and bombers

25:31.227 --> 25:36.618
for several decades, before
it was decommissioned in 1981.

25:36.620 --> 25:40.885
But according to statements
from multiple whistle-blowers,

25:40.907 --> 25:44.311
a secret laboratory hidden
deep beneath the base

25:44.467 --> 25:46.818
may still be operating.

25:49.120 --> 25:51.096
I think it's the perfect cover.

25:51.120 --> 25:53.096
You have kind of a lax
topside operation,

25:53.120 --> 25:55.585
an Air Force Station that really
nothing is going on at,

25:55.740 --> 26:00.571
but underneath the ground, you
have this extremely elaborate

26:00.727 --> 26:04.685
experiment going on, many levels
of an underground base.

26:06.307 --> 26:08.347
Each of these men
that told the tale,

26:08.373 --> 26:11.905
they don't say they entered
the base through,

26:11.927 --> 26:14.098
you know, a topside location.

26:14.253 --> 26:17.631
They would all enter Brookhaven
National Laboratories

26:17.687 --> 26:20.985
and travel on a train underneath
the ground to Montauk.

26:21.140 --> 26:23.500
So people that are working
above ground don't even know

26:23.600 --> 26:24.925
what's going on
underneath the ground.

26:24.947 --> 26:27.758
For ancient astronaut theorists,

26:27.760 --> 26:31.805
Montauk, like Area 51
and Wright-Patterson,

26:31.960 --> 26:34.665
remains notorious
as one of the places

26:34.820 --> 26:38.245
the U.S. military would carry
out numerous experiments,

26:38.420 --> 26:41.465
often with the aid
of otherworldly technology.

26:43.087 --> 26:44.418
There are some who believe

26:44.573 --> 26:46.091
these experiments

26:46.093 --> 26:48.331
even involved human subjects

26:48.487 --> 26:51.098
as part of a highly
controversial research program

26:51.107 --> 26:54.758
known as the Montauk Project.

26:54.913 --> 26:57.131
Some of the stories
about what was going on

26:57.287 --> 27:01.025
in the Montauk Project actually
tie in with something

27:01.180 --> 27:04.051
that we absolutely know
to be real,

27:04.107 --> 27:06.818
because we have declassified
documents on it,

27:06.907 --> 27:09.585
and that's MKUltra.

27:09.760 --> 27:14.731
Now, MKUltra was a program run
by the CIA and the U.S. Army,

27:14.887 --> 27:17.851
and it literally tried
to harness

27:18.027 --> 27:20.925
the technique of mind control.

27:21.080 --> 27:23.065
But there are rumors
that there were other,

27:23.087 --> 27:27.618
more exotic techniques that
people were using at Montauk:

27:27.793 --> 27:30.738
remote influencing,
for example, which is the idea

27:30.893 --> 27:34.411
that you can effectively use
the power of your mind

27:34.467 --> 27:39.038
to influence
somebody else's behavior.

27:39.040 --> 27:42.525
Clearly, there would be
huge military value

27:42.680 --> 27:44.760
in such techniques,
and that, of course,

27:44.860 --> 27:46.503
is exactly why
they were doing them.

27:46.527 --> 27:48.711
This was stuff
that was so beyond

27:48.787 --> 27:51.478
the normal thought processes
of the military mind.

27:51.633 --> 27:53.643
It wasn't making better guns,
better ammo,

27:53.667 --> 27:55.125
more efficient airplanes.

27:55.280 --> 27:57.145
This was way beyond that.

27:57.300 --> 27:59.443
This was a program that used all
sorts of different techniques

27:59.467 --> 28:02.378
to try to control human thought.

28:02.387 --> 28:06.218
Mind control?

28:06.220 --> 28:08.865
Remote thought manipulation?

28:08.887 --> 28:12.445
If the U.S. military
really did believe

28:12.600 --> 28:15.351
that such incredible power
was achievable,

28:15.353 --> 28:19.078
did it get the idea
from extraterrestrials?

28:19.080 --> 28:22.545
Perhaps even from the technology
reportedly recovered

28:22.567 --> 28:24.471
after the crash at Roswell?

28:24.527 --> 28:26.498
The big question about Montauk

28:26.500 --> 28:30.771
has always been, were they
operating with the technologies

28:30.827 --> 28:35.345
that they had because they were
given to our government

28:35.367 --> 28:40.158
by non-humans, legitimately,
as some kind of collaboration

28:40.247 --> 28:44.785
or trade,
for us to experiment with?

28:46.520 --> 28:49.331
One thing that's at Montauk

28:49.487 --> 28:51.045
is the so-called Montauk Chair.

28:51.220 --> 28:53.878
It had some kind of wires,
or there's some kind of

28:53.880 --> 28:56.339
extraterrestrial technology
associated with this chair

28:56.494 --> 28:58.892
and that, combined
with the individual's

28:58.894 --> 29:01.386
innate psychic capabilities,

29:01.388 --> 29:04.566
would allow you to engage
in transforming reality

29:04.721 --> 29:06.326
in one way or another.

29:06.368 --> 29:08.866
The subject would
sit in the chair,

29:09.021 --> 29:13.099
and this chair was meant
to manifest thought

29:13.208 --> 29:16.666
into physical reality.

29:16.821 --> 29:21.386
And included in that are
telekinesis, remote viewing.

29:21.408 --> 29:25.559
One of the experiments that they
used at first was to manifest,

29:25.561 --> 29:27.466
let's say, a glass or a ball,

29:27.621 --> 29:30.112
something simple,
an inanimate object.

29:30.268 --> 29:31.970
Whatever the subject
was thinking

29:31.994 --> 29:35.339
would manifest
into physical reality.

29:35.494 --> 29:39.132
Eventually, this evolved into
heightened psychic abilities.

29:39.308 --> 29:42.526
They claimed they could teleport
from one place to another.

29:47.148 --> 29:49.090
According to many researchers

29:49.114 --> 29:51.279
and ancient astronaut theorists,

29:51.454 --> 29:53.046
accounts of the so-called
"Montauk Chair"

29:53.068 --> 29:56.926
and its connection
to mind control

29:57.081 --> 29:59.406
are strangely similar
to accounts of a chair

29:59.408 --> 30:01.939
that dates back to the days
of the pharaohs:

30:02.114 --> 30:05.506
the throne of Ptah.

30:07.834 --> 30:09.677
Ptah was one of the most
intriguing gods

30:09.701 --> 30:11.119
of Ancient Egypt.

30:11.208 --> 30:14.459
He was the god
before all the other gods.

30:14.548 --> 30:17.299
He created Earth.

30:17.454 --> 30:20.172
He created humanity.

30:20.328 --> 30:22.379
Unlike the other gods,

30:22.381 --> 30:27.406
Ptah would create the world
with his thought.

30:27.448 --> 30:32.592
He would think it, feel it
and hence, it was created.

30:32.648 --> 30:36.626
Ptah is portrayed
sitting on a throne.

30:36.801 --> 30:39.281
And this throne is thought to be
the center point from which

30:39.394 --> 30:42.612
his thought is able
to manifest creation.

30:42.668 --> 30:44.484
What's fascinating
about these scenes

30:44.508 --> 30:47.232
is that this throne
is feathered.

30:47.388 --> 30:50.279
It's feathered because it flies.

30:50.454 --> 30:52.966
It's known
as his ascension throne.

30:53.121 --> 30:56.219
When we compare the descriptions
of the Montauk Chair

30:56.308 --> 30:58.819
with the ascension throne
of Ptah,

30:58.821 --> 31:01.752
Was the U.S. military involved

31:01.908 --> 31:05.379
in reverse engineering
an extraterrestrial technology

31:05.488 --> 31:09.326
that was used thousands
of years ago in Ancient Egypt?

31:09.368 --> 31:11.766
Could the legends

31:11.941 --> 31:14.886
about an Egyptian god
and his flying throne

31:14.908 --> 31:17.179
and the report
of a thought-control chair

31:17.354 --> 31:21.199
at the Montauk military base
really be connected?

31:21.288 --> 31:25.759
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes, and suggest

31:25.761 --> 31:28.646
that not only has
the U.S. government been working

31:28.668 --> 31:32.519
to acquire and perfect
alien technology for decades,

31:32.674 --> 31:37.919
but that the operations
at Montauk are still going on.

31:38.008 --> 31:39.999
Several people have claimed

31:40.088 --> 31:43.466
that they were part
of these Montauk experiments.

31:43.641 --> 31:46.799
They do recall sitting
in a special chair.

31:46.888 --> 31:49.906
And people say that today

31:50.081 --> 31:51.966
there is still activity
in the underground sections

31:51.988 --> 31:53.406
of the Montauk base.

31:55.188 --> 31:57.812
Is the seemingly
abandoned military base

31:57.968 --> 32:01.726
on Eastern Long Island still,
secretly, in operation?

32:01.748 --> 32:05.979
And if so, is Montauk part
of a vast network

32:06.154 --> 32:09.072
of government laboratories
and factories

32:09.128 --> 32:13.266
where extraterrestrial
technology is being harvested?

32:13.288 --> 32:16.346
Ancient astronaut
theorists insist

32:16.501 --> 32:19.159
such an incredible notion
is true,

32:19.161 --> 32:22.572
and they point to yet another
highly guarded installation

32:22.648 --> 32:27.426
as proof that alien technology
is not only being tested,

32:27.428 --> 32:30.766
but that it's
already being used.

32:36.701 --> 32:37.979
Washington, D.C.

32:37.981 --> 32:41.846
December 16, 2017.

32:42.001 --> 32:46.279
After a decade of speculation
within the UFO community,

32:46.434 --> 32:49.399
officials at the Pentagon
confirm the existence

32:49.508 --> 32:51.819
of a highly secretive
UFO research project

32:51.994 --> 32:56.559
known as the Advanced Aerospace
Threat Identification Program,

32:56.561 --> 32:59.026
or AATIP.

32:59.048 --> 33:03.212
The project was funded
by Congress in 2007

33:03.268 --> 33:06.839
with the help
of Senator Harry Reid of Nevada.

33:06.928 --> 33:10.519
What's different about
the AATIP program is the fact

33:10.674 --> 33:13.192
that it involved a private
company, Bigelow Aerospace.

33:13.194 --> 33:15.472
This has never been done before.

33:15.628 --> 33:17.704
The government previously
has always kept

33:17.728 --> 33:20.566
all of its UFO
extraterrestrial information,

33:20.721 --> 33:22.959
all of its reports,
completely separately.

33:23.114 --> 33:25.767
So that makes it very,
very unique and very different

33:25.789 --> 33:28.447
from Projects Sign
and Blue Book.

33:28.622 --> 33:31.540
The Pentagon ran
this program officially

33:31.695 --> 33:33.927
from 2007 to 2012,

33:33.969 --> 33:36.953
although there's a lot of reason
to believe that the program

33:37.009 --> 33:38.913
not only has continued,

33:38.969 --> 33:42.127
but that multiple programs
of this sort have continued.

33:44.862 --> 33:46.747
But why would
the U.S. government

33:46.769 --> 33:50.627
allow such sensitive research
to take place

33:50.802 --> 33:52.922
outside of its
secure military facilities?

33:54.475 --> 33:57.273
According
to ancient astronaut theorists,

33:57.275 --> 34:00.353
the answer is all too obvious.

34:00.409 --> 34:02.327
Over the years,

34:02.482 --> 34:05.320
the government realized,

34:05.475 --> 34:09.760
if you can take projects
that were developing

34:09.762 --> 34:14.233
and move them
from inside the Pentagon itself,

34:14.289 --> 34:18.453
and move them into industry,
guess what you get to avoid?

34:18.509 --> 34:20.313
Freedom of information.

34:20.489 --> 34:23.060
Inside the government,

34:23.215 --> 34:25.193
the military,
Department of Defense,

34:25.195 --> 34:26.864
the scientists
and engineers there

34:26.889 --> 34:29.567
are possibly susceptible to
the Freedom of Information Act.

34:29.722 --> 34:32.547
People can fill out a
Freedom of Information Act form

34:32.549 --> 34:35.187
and request information
on any government program.

34:35.342 --> 34:39.393
Well, private companies
are not susceptible.

34:39.395 --> 34:41.875
They don't have to adhere to
the Freedom of Information Act.

34:41.902 --> 34:45.699
So the big aerospace
defense companies, for example,

34:45.875 --> 34:50.667
can do their own research
in their own private facilities,

34:50.822 --> 34:53.147
and they never have
to tell you anything about that

34:53.302 --> 34:55.286
if they don't want to.

34:55.442 --> 34:57.740
And when you look
at the exemptions

34:57.895 --> 35:00.087
to the Freedom
of Information Act,

35:00.242 --> 35:03.867
exemption number four
covers trade secrets,

35:03.889 --> 35:08.813
information which belongs
to the private sector.

35:08.969 --> 35:12.460
So when the government put out
some of their UFO programs

35:12.569 --> 35:16.580
to Bigelow Aerospace,
what they were doing, cleverly,

35:16.582 --> 35:20.147
was making scrutiny
much more difficult.

35:20.302 --> 35:22.507
And we know from Luis Elizondo,

35:22.662 --> 35:25.520
the program manager
of the AATIP program,

35:25.675 --> 35:27.453
that they received a number

35:27.455 --> 35:30.480
of <i> shocking</i> UFO cases

35:30.635 --> 35:32.653
that came their way

35:32.809 --> 35:34.525
in connection
with the U.S. military.

35:34.549 --> 35:37.547
The word he used was "beyond
next generation technology."

35:43.749 --> 35:47.793
According to sources
within the AATIP program,

35:47.849 --> 35:50.720
the government
secretly collects materials...

35:50.729 --> 35:53.567
often referred to
as "metamaterials"...

35:53.722 --> 35:55.682
from extraterrestrial
crash sites

35:55.742 --> 35:57.053
and then turns them over

35:57.209 --> 36:00.307
to be reverse engineered
by approved contractors,

36:00.482 --> 36:03.187
like those at Bigelow Aerospace.

36:03.362 --> 36:05.600
Metamaterials are

36:05.755 --> 36:08.773
materials that
have been combined in such a way

36:08.929 --> 36:11.473
that the isotopic ratios
of the materials

36:11.529 --> 36:14.400
are not found on Planet Earth.

36:14.555 --> 36:17.773
I worked with, uh,
some of these artifacts.

36:17.829 --> 36:19.993
I put them through
various tests.

36:19.995 --> 36:22.240
There was nothing unusual
about the materials

36:22.395 --> 36:25.767
they were made of, but they
were layered in such a way

36:25.809 --> 36:27.873
that it took some doing

36:28.029 --> 36:30.940
to make them
in their configuration.

36:30.942 --> 36:33.613
And also, the interesting piece
of it was when you put them

36:33.789 --> 36:35.873
under extremely high
electric fields,

36:36.029 --> 36:39.133
they tend to show properties
of propulsion,

36:39.189 --> 36:41.407
meaning they would move
in directions,

36:41.562 --> 36:43.780
sometimes toward the field,
sometimes away from the field,

36:43.782 --> 36:46.867
that wasn't typical
of standard electrostatic things

36:47.022 --> 36:49.327
that I had seen before.

36:49.482 --> 36:51.787
What metamaterials will do
is they will alter

36:51.942 --> 36:54.087
electromagnetic frequencies,

36:54.129 --> 36:56.473
or the visual spectrum.

36:56.549 --> 37:00.247
They can bend light if they're
engineered in such a way.

37:00.402 --> 37:02.813
They can change
acoustic properties.

37:02.889 --> 37:05.247
And the imagination
is the limit.

37:05.422 --> 37:08.260
So they can really do
almost anything.

37:08.269 --> 37:11.473
Is the government's
increasing use

37:11.629 --> 37:14.220
of outside agencies
and contractors

37:14.395 --> 37:16.813
designed to throw
UFO investigators

37:16.969 --> 37:19.560
and ancient astronaut
theorists off?

37:19.569 --> 37:24.060
And if so, does that mean
that infamous top secret sites,

37:24.215 --> 37:27.793
like Area 51 and its
alleged underground network

37:27.795 --> 37:31.000
of covert laboratories
and military installations,

37:31.155 --> 37:34.287
will soon be obsolete?

37:34.442 --> 37:38.360
Ancient astronaut
theorists say no,

37:38.449 --> 37:40.500
and they insist that,
if anything,

37:40.675 --> 37:42.993
there are now
more government sites

37:43.049 --> 37:46.647
engaged in extraterrestrial
research than ever,

37:46.669 --> 37:49.907
and that this research
is no longer being confined

37:49.929 --> 37:52.521
to areas
within the United States,

37:52.523 --> 37:54.728
or even on Planet Earth.

38:03.850 --> 38:07.128
The U.S. Air Force
announces that SpaceX,

38:07.283 --> 38:11.988
an aerospace company run
by billionaire CEO Elon Musk,

38:12.143 --> 38:14.061
is now eligible to participate

38:14.216 --> 38:17.368
in the launch
of military satellites.

38:17.523 --> 38:20.688
The announcement
leads many to speculate

38:20.843 --> 38:24.901
whether SpaceX may be contracted
in the future for additional,

38:25.076 --> 38:26.768
and perhaps even more covert,

38:26.790 --> 38:29.908
military space projects.

38:29.930 --> 38:31.690
In 2015, SpaceX...

38:31.810 --> 38:33.559
which is a private corporation,
of course...

38:33.583 --> 38:35.961
Was actually certified
by the U.S. government

38:36.050 --> 38:39.228
for national security launches
into space.

38:39.383 --> 38:41.423
And what that means is,
you've now got

38:41.456 --> 38:43.468
another private corporation
which is authorized

38:43.470 --> 38:47.328
to actually put
secret payloads into orbit.

38:47.483 --> 38:50.614
What that means is
that their entire operation

38:50.616 --> 38:54.608
now kind of flows under the dark
umbrella of national security.

38:54.783 --> 38:58.934
It's possible
that the private ventures,

38:58.990 --> 39:02.221
like SpaceX,
like Bigelow Aerospace

39:02.223 --> 39:04.548
and the various others,
will come up with a way

39:04.703 --> 39:06.401
to make it economically viable

39:06.576 --> 39:08.381
to colonize Mars.

39:08.390 --> 39:09.981
For decades...

39:09.983 --> 39:11.932
ever since the first
Earth satellites

39:11.956 --> 39:14.068
and rovers
began sending back data

39:14.090 --> 39:16.481
about the so-called
"Red Planet"...

39:16.483 --> 39:19.394
Mars has been the focus
of intense scrutiny

39:19.396 --> 39:22.421
by ancient astronaut theorists.

39:22.510 --> 39:25.168
They cite images
of structures...

39:25.190 --> 39:28.161
carvings
and other strange anomalies

39:28.316 --> 39:31.628
as evidence that Mars was...
and might still be...

39:31.650 --> 39:34.288
a hub of extraterrestrial
activity.

39:36.910 --> 39:38.968
Is it possible
that the U.S. government,

39:38.990 --> 39:41.054
along with other nations,

39:41.130 --> 39:45.521
has proof that such
an audacious notion is true?

39:45.523 --> 39:47.468
And could this be the reason

39:47.643 --> 39:50.648
why the human-based Mars
missions are being conducted

39:50.803 --> 39:53.341
not by publicly funded
governments,

39:53.516 --> 39:57.108
but by a number
of privately funded corporations

39:57.263 --> 39:59.888
with their own
seemingly disparate agendas?

40:01.923 --> 40:03.932
I am extremely familiar
with this technique,

40:03.956 --> 40:06.341
and it's one of the ways
that you protect

40:06.496 --> 40:09.934
classified information
and big secrets.

40:09.936 --> 40:12.974
You can have
a highly classified project,

40:13.030 --> 40:16.134
but effectively,
it's broken into small parts.

40:16.190 --> 40:19.141
Everyone's working
on a piece of it.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.408
No one necessarily knows what
the person next door to them

40:22.563 --> 40:26.441
is doing, and very few people
have the big picture.

40:26.443 --> 40:29.154
It's a world that
I've operated in myself

40:29.310 --> 40:32.008
in my 21 years
at the Ministry of Defense.

40:32.163 --> 40:35.721
It's even possible
that somebody could be working

40:35.876 --> 40:40.188
on extraterrestrial technology
and not know it.

40:42.076 --> 40:44.501
We are on the cusp
of a brand-new reality

40:44.676 --> 40:48.468
of super-advanced technology,
that will see us colonizing

40:48.470 --> 40:51.834
the Moon, Mars,
traveling into deep space.

40:51.910 --> 40:55.208
This is a chapter
that's opening in human affairs

40:55.230 --> 40:59.408
that began as long ago as 1947
with the Roswell crash,

40:59.563 --> 41:03.234
after which the U.S. military
began preparing us

41:03.236 --> 41:05.908
for a life in which we will be
living with extraterrestrials,

41:06.063 --> 41:09.221
both on Earth and in space.

41:09.223 --> 41:13.728
Are the U.S.
government's efforts to examine

41:13.750 --> 41:17.268
and utilize extraterrestrials
and their technology

41:17.443 --> 41:20.294
really on the threshold
of a bold new era?

41:20.450 --> 41:23.328
One where places like Area 51,

41:23.483 --> 41:25.568
Wright-Patterson, Montauk,

41:25.743 --> 41:28.768
and even Mars
will all become part

41:28.770 --> 41:31.848
of a larger
and more powerful network?

41:32.023 --> 41:33.908
One that will facilitate

41:34.063 --> 41:37.861
mankind's anticipated journey
to the stars?

41:37.950 --> 41:40.188
Ancient astronaut
theorists believe

41:40.363 --> 41:42.548
there are forces
in the government

41:42.570 --> 41:46.694
that insist we are not yet ready
to have the answers,

41:46.850 --> 41:49.121
and that the truth
must remain hidden away,

41:49.130 --> 41:53.354
behind electric fences
and security cameras,

41:53.530 --> 41:56.988
at places
both known and unknown,

41:57.143 --> 42:00.114
and equally protected
by the notion

42:00.170 --> 42:02.908
that what we can see
with our own eyes

42:02.930 --> 42:05.921
could not possibly be true.
