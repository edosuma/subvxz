17:20.417 --> 17:23.919
- Let me buy you a coffee, huh?
- Woman: Yeah, okay.

17:32.697 --> 17:36.732
John: She's been in there
three times the last two years,

17:36.834 --> 17:38.234
crashed out every time.

17:38.336 --> 17:40.636
And that's not saying she hasn't
been other places, too.

17:40.738 --> 17:42.772
I'd definitely check into
that if I was you.

17:42.874 --> 17:44.407
This isn't admissible.

17:44.509 --> 17:48.911
Why not? I paid good money for it.

17:50.214 --> 17:52.782
Of course it isn't, not
without a subpoena,

17:52.884 --> 17:54.483
so you should get one.

17:54.585 --> 17:57.686
You should also check to see
if she's got a sheet. A rap sheet.

17:57.789 --> 18:00.956
Yeah, I know what a sheet is, but
what does it matter? She's the victim.

18:01.058 --> 18:03.292
What, Naz isn't, too?

18:03.394 --> 18:08.731
If I was still his lawyer, I'd
at least pretend I thought so.

18:08.833 --> 18:10.533
It's like having a nuclear arsenal.

18:10.635 --> 18:13.402
You don't want to use it, but if
the other side knows you got it,

18:13.504 --> 18:16.038
they tend to come to the table sooner.

18:16.140 --> 18:18.260
And you can stop staring at
my feet any time you want.

18:18.276 --> 18:22.044
I'm sorry. It's just, um, my
father has the same condition,

18:22.146 --> 18:25.014
- not as bad, but, uh...
- You know what I really resent?

18:25.116 --> 18:30.386
Attractive, young women telling
me I remind them of their fathers.

18:35.827 --> 18:38.227
So, you want them?

18:46.137 --> 18:50.139

You? You know, I live here.

22:49.613 --> 22:54.817
Bailiff: The people vs. Nasir Khan,
indictment number 4157 OF 2014.

22:54.919 --> 22:56.452
Arraign the defendant.

22:56.554 --> 22:58.387
The grand jury of the state
of New York has indicted you

22:58.489 --> 23:00.089
for the crimes of possession of a weapon

23:00.124 --> 23:01.790
for deadly purpose, resisting arrest,

23:01.892 --> 23:03.692
aggravated sexual
assault in the first degree,

23:03.761 --> 23:07.563
and murder in the first
degree. How do you plead?

23:07.665 --> 23:10.766
We've got a full dance
card today, folks.

23:10.868 --> 23:13.535
Not guilty. Not guilty.

23:13.637 --> 23:15.104
There you go.

23:15.206 --> 23:16.939
Your Honor, at this point,

23:17.041 --> 23:18.941
I am filing a copy of
the indictment report

23:19.043 --> 23:20.743
and the victim
disclosure statement report.

23:20.845 --> 23:23.045
Alison: Your Honor, I wasn't here
for the preliminary arraignment

23:23.147 --> 23:24.680
due to the fact that
I wasn't yet retained,

23:24.782 --> 23:27.349
but I'm certainly here now.
And it is my understanding

23:27.451 --> 23:29.611
that when my client was remanded
at that first hearing,

23:29.653 --> 23:31.754
he was advised the issue of reasonable

23:31.856 --> 23:35.224
and affordable bail would be revisited,
so that's what we're doing now.

23:35.326 --> 23:38.160
Mr. Khan vigorously maintains
his innocence and is intent

23:38.262 --> 23:40.629
on fighting these
charges until he's exonerated.

23:40.731 --> 23:43.832
He wants to go to trial, and
so is not a flight risk.

23:43.934 --> 23:46.183
If we instead would
like to see a young man

23:46.208 --> 23:48.661
with no criminal record
turned into a criminal,

23:48.739 --> 23:52.574
then let's have him sit at Rikers as
long as the slow wheels of justice take.

23:52.676 --> 23:54.877
Your Honor, it's a felony
murder. He's facing life.

23:54.979 --> 23:57.613
There's no bail high enough
to guarantee he won't take off.

23:57.715 --> 24:01.016
(chuckles) Where? Where is he gonna go?

24:01.118 --> 24:03.418
To Pakistan, where he's never been?

24:03.521 --> 24:06.488
To some al-Qaeda training camp?
I mean, what is going on here?

24:06.590 --> 24:08.056
There's nothing going on here.

24:08.159 --> 24:10.259
Well, he doesn't even own a passport,

24:10.361 --> 24:12.427
so where is he going to go?

24:12.530 --> 24:15.097
Your Honor, I don't
know if it was media pressure

24:15.199 --> 24:18.233
or political pressure or just
good old-fashioned 9/11 profiling,

24:18.335 --> 24:21.303
but I have never seen a grand
jury dance so fast in my life,

24:21.405 --> 24:23.438
leaving me no time to properly prepare.

24:23.541 --> 24:25.974
Prepare for what? This isn't his trial.

24:26.076 --> 24:28.343
You'll have plenty of time to prepare.

24:28.445 --> 24:31.547
And it's not as if he didn't
have professional counsel before.

24:31.649 --> 24:35.918
Excuse me? "Professional
counsel"? He had John Stone.

24:36.020 --> 24:37.486
(laughter)

24:37.588 --> 24:39.655
- Judge: Ms. Crowe...
- Alison: Your Honor?

24:39.757 --> 24:42.291
Not in my court.

24:42.393 --> 24:45.160
I apologize.

24:45.262 --> 24:49.264
Your client seems to have a
little trouble looking at me.

24:49.366 --> 24:51.900
Look at the judge.

24:52.002 --> 24:53.335
That's better.

24:53.437 --> 24:57.706
Mr. Khan, I see no reason
to change your bail status.

24:57.808 --> 25:03.612

we're done here. Next.

33:22.846 --> 33:28.383
Bad instructions to the jury, and the county
prosecutor office didn't want to retry.

33:28.485 --> 33:31.086
A month later, he's out.

33:31.188 --> 33:33.822
I see this nigger in a club.

33:33.924 --> 33:36.725
He drinking, dancing, living.

33:36.827 --> 33:41.029
I'm like, "Nah." I go
home to get my whistle.

33:41.131 --> 33:43.331
I come back to slaughter his ass.

33:43.433 --> 33:47.569
Boom. Miss. Caught a busboy instead.

33:49.306 --> 33:52.140
So now my niece is dead,

33:52.242 --> 33:56.177
busboy's dead, and I'm in here,

33:56.279 --> 33:58.190
and that nigga's out there like a

33:58.192 --> 34:02.408
nut-swinging applejack.
Ain't that something?

34:04.154 --> 34:05.520
I'm sorry.

34:05.622 --> 34:09.056
Pretty girl, too.

34:09.159 --> 34:11.126
You want to see a picture?

34:11.228 --> 34:13.862
Okay.

34:26.275 --> 34:29.944
Man: Four months pregnant, too.

34:48.498 --> 34:50.665
Man: They're fully in
the right to do that.

34:50.766 --> 34:53.435
(indistinct conversations)

34:59.476 --> 35:03.244
If we see any more of
these headlines with his face...

35:03.346 --> 35:06.781
(continues indistinctly)

35:18.695 --> 35:21.763
The guy's a Sikh, and he
gets beat half to death.

35:21.865 --> 35:24.766
Offer them low murder,
and we're done with it.

35:29.573 --> 35:31.639
Doctor: Oh, my God,
what the hell is this?

35:31.741 --> 35:33.374
You look like you've been
going after yourself

35:33.477 --> 35:35.076
with a sharpened pencil or something.

35:35.178 --> 35:37.111
Chopstick.

35:37.214 --> 35:39.280
Well, I had a guy use
a knitting needle once.

35:39.382 --> 35:41.416
You could see right through it
to the ankle bone with that one.

35:41.518 --> 35:44.552
You wouldn't believe what
people do to themselves. I would.

35:44.654 --> 35:47.922
I'm ready to jump out a window.

35:48.024 --> 35:49.691
Yeah, I've seen that, too.

35:49.793 --> 35:52.861
Uh, so what's in the bag? Is
that your medicine or your lunch?

35:52.963 --> 35:55.063
What I've been
using from another doctor.

35:55.165 --> 35:56.464
Gimme.

36:02.272 --> 36:04.939
Just level with me.

36:05.041 --> 36:07.375
Is there any fucking hope?

36:08.378 --> 36:10.478
Not with any of this.

36:10.580 --> 36:13.147
And not with you gouging yourself
like that, either.

36:13.250 --> 36:16.885
First, you're gonna go to
a pharmacy and pick this up.

36:16.987 --> 36:22.957
This is real medicine, not Mickey Mouse
medicine, a serious corticosteroid.

36:23.059 --> 36:24.926
Then you're gonna go to
a medical-supply place,

36:25.028 --> 36:26.995
get a U.V. lamp... they're
a little pricey...

36:27.097 --> 36:29.931
and some U.V. glasses.

36:30.033 --> 36:31.766
Then you're gonna go to a grocery store,

36:31.868 --> 36:34.636
get some Clorox, and bathe in it.

36:34.738 --> 36:39.741
Here's how much to use. Clorox bleach?

36:39.843 --> 36:41.763
Or you can keep hacking
away with your chopsticks

36:41.845 --> 36:43.912
until you're walking around
on your kneecaps.

36:44.014 --> 36:46.548
It's up to you.

36:58.328 --> 37:01.663
(panting)

37:16.112 --> 37:17.845
Yo, Freddy.

37:19.416 --> 37:22.283
Hey, Freddy, man. We ain't got no beef.

37:22.385 --> 37:25.620
Beef? Who said anything about a beef?

37:25.722 --> 37:28.389
Just looking for a big man to spar with.

37:28.491 --> 37:30.658
(grunts)

37:30.760 --> 37:33.528
- Come on, Fred.
- Freddy: "Come on," what?

37:33.663 --> 37:35.697
Man, I heard you took
silver in the Gloves, man.

37:35.799 --> 37:38.900
Show me what you got, baby!

37:43.173 --> 37:45.139
That's what I'm talking
about. I like that.

37:46.476 --> 37:47.809
Oh, shit.

37:47.911 --> 37:50.712
For real, for real, huh? That's
what I'm talking about.

37:50.814 --> 37:52.447
Chill, man.

37:54.484 --> 37:56.718
What's up with that cell
phone business, bro?

37:56.820 --> 37:57.986
I ain't got no cell phone business.

37:58.088 --> 37:59.648
I don't know what you're talking about.

37:59.689 --> 38:03.057
Shit, dawg. I must have
heard wrong, then.

38:03.159 --> 38:06.060
(grunting)

38:06.162 --> 38:10.632
Come on, Freddy. I told you, I
don't know what you're talking about.

38:11.901 --> 38:14.569
(grunting) Oh, man.

38:14.671 --> 38:16.237
Not one cell phone?

38:18.241 --> 38:20.108
- Oh!
- (heart beating)

38:20.210 --> 38:23.411
(grunting)

38:51.374 --> 38:54.642
We'll knock five years
off the max, 25 to life.

38:54.744 --> 38:56.678
He'll be before a parole board in 20.

38:56.780 --> 38:58.479
Before them for what? Murder is murder.

38:58.581 --> 39:00.048
They'll never let him
out, and you know it.

39:00.150 --> 39:02.517
You want to talk seriously?
Take life off the table.

39:02.619 --> 39:04.452
Oh, I don't think I can do that.

39:04.554 --> 39:06.821
Well, I won't be able to sell
him on an indeterminate sentence,

39:06.923 --> 39:10.625
so I guess that's it.

39:10.727 --> 39:15.596
Murder two, no sex
assault, capped at 25.

39:15.699 --> 39:17.665
Man one, flat 10.

39:17.767 --> 39:19.867
You're kidding. No, I'm not kidding.

39:19.969 --> 39:22.770
High man, 20, serves 15.

39:22.872 --> 39:25.339
Okay. We'll take our
chances with the jury.

39:25.442 --> 39:30.545
That's it? You expect me to
negotiate against myself?

39:30.647 --> 39:35.183
Yes. Man one, flat 15.

39:35.285 --> 39:37.051
I can try that with him.

39:37.153 --> 39:41.122
I think you'll succeed.

39:41.224 --> 39:42.790
(Muzak playing)

39:42.892 --> 39:44.926
20 milligrams. Wow.

39:45.028 --> 39:47.361
- John: What?
- Nothing.

39:47.464 --> 39:49.630
What? It's just...

39:49.733 --> 39:52.266
I'm not saying it's gonna happen,

39:52.368 --> 39:56.037
but possible side effects
from taking steroids this strong...

39:56.139 --> 39:59.774
- Like?
- Like, you know, hair loss,

39:59.876 --> 40:01.642
explosive acne,

40:01.745 --> 40:06.581
uncontrollable crying
jags, shrinking balls.

40:06.683 --> 40:09.917
On the other hand, there's
an excellent chance

40:10.019 --> 40:13.121
you'll hit 75 homers this year.

40:20.130 --> 40:21.963
(sighs)

40:30.807 --> 40:33.141
Alison: What I say in
court is for the judge.

40:33.243 --> 40:35.042
What I say to the
press is for the public.

40:35.145 --> 40:39.046
But with you, I have to be
honest, and it is not good.

40:39.149 --> 40:41.849
Running away with a knife from the
scene of a brutal stabbing murder

40:41.951 --> 40:45.486
documented with photos that'll
make a jury's heart stop...

40:45.588 --> 40:50.224
But I didn't do it. We are way
past, "I didn't do it," Naz.

40:50.326 --> 40:53.261
Here's what time it
is. If you are convicted,

40:53.363 --> 40:57.932
which you likely will be, you will
spend the rest of your life in a cage,

40:58.034 --> 41:02.937
waking up every morning
wishing you were dead, unless...

41:03.039 --> 41:05.185
- Unless?
- Unless I can somehow

41:05.210 --> 41:07.432
convince the D.A.'s office,

41:07.510 --> 41:10.611
and it is a long shot, to
accept a plea of manslaughter

41:10.713 --> 41:15.149
with a max sentence of, say, 15 years.

41:15.251 --> 41:19.453
But I'm not gonna fight for you on this
unless you can say, "Yes, I accept that.

41:19.556 --> 41:20.955
It's better than the alternative."

41:21.057 --> 41:25.993
And, Nasir, believe me, it is.

41:28.097 --> 41:29.630
Can I think about it?

41:29.732 --> 41:31.432
Of course.

41:31.534 --> 41:32.600
But when we go before the judge,

41:32.702 --> 41:34.936
it has to be "yes" or nothing at all.

41:35.038 --> 41:36.370
You understand?

41:41.477 --> 41:44.378
Where's your associate? My what?

41:44.480 --> 41:45.880
The one who met with my parents.

41:45.949 --> 41:50.051
Oh, she's just... she's in court. Why?

41:50.153 --> 41:52.553
They liked her.

41:54.424 --> 41:56.824
My parents.

42:03.533 --> 42:07.201
(indistinct chatter)

42:34.631 --> 42:36.497
What'd she say?

42:36.599 --> 42:41.002
She said he's going to say he did it.

42:41.104 --> 42:43.104
What?

42:43.206 --> 42:45.740
She told him to say it.

42:47.443 --> 42:49.810
Dennis: So, here's my question,

42:49.913 --> 42:54.348
When's the D.A. gonna grow a pair
and actually take a killer to trial?

42:54.450 --> 42:56.517
You think it was up to me?

42:56.619 --> 42:59.487
I have a boss who has
a boss who has a boss.

42:59.589 --> 43:02.256
How does it work with you?

43:02.358 --> 43:05.860
You're so predictable. And you're not?

43:05.962 --> 43:09.697
(rock music plays)

43:20.944 --> 43:24.845
Give me the Saints in the under.

43:24.948 --> 43:27.114
Why don't you just flush
it down the toilet, John?

43:27.216 --> 43:29.650
The Saints couldn't beat Cooley High.

43:29.752 --> 43:33.220
- You wanna bet?
- Funny, man.

43:33.323 --> 43:36.891
- - Hey, heard about your kid.
What, my son?

43:36.993 --> 43:39.433
- Woman on TV: He was there!
- No, man, your kid, your killer.

43:39.462 --> 43:44.498
He had her blood on his clothes.
He had the murder weapon on him.

43:44.600 --> 43:47.234
- John: Ah. That.
- He tried to escape police custody.

43:47.337 --> 43:50.738
- Listen, I respect the D.A...
- What'd you hear?

43:50.840 --> 43:53.708
The deal. Man, 15 for that?

43:53.810 --> 43:58.079
Gift from the gods.
I assume you took it.

44:00.583 --> 44:03.851
Jack and soda.

44:03.953 --> 44:05.753
Oh, hey, John.

44:05.855 --> 44:10.825
Heard about your kid. What
a gift from the gods.

44:10.927 --> 44:13.627
Man: Small money's gonna
tell you, "Take the plea."

44:13.730 --> 44:16.197
I got to say, man, the
dude who killed my niece,

44:16.299 --> 44:20.801
he took his chances with the trial.
Next thing, he's walking free.

44:20.903 --> 44:23.938
Now, understood, that's like a
freak of justice or whatever,

44:24.040 --> 44:28.009
but if he took what they offered,
he'd be upstate right now,

44:28.111 --> 44:32.213
and I'd be bringing fresh flowers
to my niece's grave.

44:37.820 --> 44:42.156
- What was her name?
- Nah.

44:42.258 --> 44:46.660
I can't even bring myself to
say it no more, you know?

45:02.345 --> 45:06.213
You understand what's
gonna happen in there? Yes.

45:06.315 --> 45:09.884
And you're ready to do it? Yes.

45:09.986 --> 45:13.354
I didn't like the sound
of that "yes." Try again.

45:14.791 --> 45:16.557
Yes.

45:18.594 --> 45:21.328
Guard?

45:22.565 --> 45:25.399
Don't move.

45:27.203 --> 45:29.036
Put it down.

45:29.138 --> 45:32.840
Okay, I need you to do something for me.

45:40.316 --> 45:44.285
Officer, I'm here to see the defendant.

45:47.457 --> 45:49.090
Hi. I'm Chandra.

45:49.192 --> 45:52.059
I'm working with Ms. Crowe.

45:55.598 --> 45:58.599
- You okay?
- Not really.

45:58.701 --> 46:00.201
You know what's going on here?

46:00.303 --> 46:04.238
I do. And I know it's
tough, but it's a good deal.

46:04.340 --> 46:07.741
You think I'm doing the
right thing to accept it?

46:07.844 --> 46:09.310
Yes.

46:09.412 --> 46:13.013
Well, why would they accept
it if it's good for me?

46:13.116 --> 46:15.516
Trials cost a lot of money.

46:15.618 --> 46:18.786
If they can
reasonably avoid it, they will.

46:18.855 --> 46:21.522
It happens every day.

46:21.624 --> 46:23.958
Thank you.

46:24.060 --> 46:25.960
For?

46:26.062 --> 46:29.797
For just talking to
me like I'm a person.

46:35.004 --> 46:37.171
What would you do?

46:39.008 --> 46:41.509
She told me to come in here
and talk some sense into you,

46:41.611 --> 46:46.714
but if I were you, I
would ask myself one question:

46:46.816 --> 46:49.617
Did I kill her?

46:49.719 --> 46:54.088
If the answer is "yes," take the deal.

46:54.190 --> 46:56.790
If it's "no"...

46:59.061 --> 47:00.961
don't.

47:14.544 --> 47:18.846
Hey, unless you fuck it up in
there, 15 years is 12 years.

47:18.948 --> 47:21.749
12 years, you still have a chance
of walking out a human being.

47:21.817 --> 47:23.584
Any more than that, no.

47:23.686 --> 47:26.487
You'll be 35 when you get
out, and you'll still have a life.

47:26.589 --> 47:27.888
Take the deal.

47:27.990 --> 47:30.491
- It says that I killed her.
- No, it doesn't.

47:30.593 --> 47:34.395
It says you don't trust 12 idiots on a
jury to get it right, and neither do I.

47:34.497 --> 47:38.199
You want to play roulette? Go to
Atlantic City where the odds are better.

47:38.301 --> 47:40.768
My parents will never
know I didn't do it for sure.

47:40.870 --> 47:43.337
They don't know that now.

47:46.442 --> 47:51.612
Naz, I'd kill to be 35 again.

47:51.714 --> 47:53.314
Take the deal.

47:55.051 --> 47:57.418
Bailiff: All rise.

48:05.995 --> 48:08.495
All right.

48:08.598 --> 48:11.999
I understand that in an
exchange for a plea of guilty,

48:12.101 --> 48:15.636
the people are offering to
downgrade the charge of murder one

48:15.738 --> 48:19.240
to manslaughter one with
a sentence of 15 years.

48:19.342 --> 48:22.042
Is that your understanding
of the agreement, Ms. Crowe?

48:22.144 --> 48:26.146
It is, Your Honor. Mr. Khan,
is that your understanding?

48:26.249 --> 48:28.349
- Yes.
- All right.

48:28.451 --> 48:30.351
You're gonna be
asked a series of questions

48:30.453 --> 48:31.986
by the district attorney.

48:32.088 --> 48:34.655
If at any time you
don't understand what's being

48:34.757 --> 48:38.592
asked of you or you have any
need for clarification,

48:38.694 --> 48:41.895
feel free to interrupt and
ask any question, okay?

48:41.998 --> 48:45.299
- Okay.
- Bailiff: Defendant, please rise.

48:48.904 --> 48:50.838
Raise your right hand.

48:50.940 --> 48:53.741
Do you swear or affirm to
tell the truth, the whole truth,

48:53.843 --> 48:57.311
- and nothing but the truth?
- I do.

49:01.117 --> 49:05.452
Have you spoken with your lawyer
before making this application?

49:05.554 --> 49:06.920
Yes.

49:06.989 --> 49:08.956
Have you taken any drugs or alcohol

49:09.058 --> 49:10.991
or anything else that
would affect your ability

49:11.093 --> 49:13.961
- to understand these proceedings today?
- No.

49:14.063 --> 49:17.865
Do you understand that pleading
guilty is the same as going to trial

49:17.967 --> 49:21.001
and being convicted of
manslaughter in the first degree?

49:21.103 --> 49:24.138
Yes. You understand that
by pleading guilty today,

49:24.240 --> 49:26.640
you are giving up your
right to cross-examination

49:26.742 --> 49:31.045
or to call witnesses to testify
on your behalf in front of a jury?

49:31.147 --> 49:35.182
Yes. Do you understand
that by pleading guilty,

49:35.284 --> 49:40.054
you give up your right to
appeal to a higher court? Yes.

49:40.156 --> 49:45.626
Are you pleading guilty because
you are, in fact, guilty?

49:51.634 --> 49:54.168
Yes.

49:54.270 --> 49:57.971
In your own words, then,

49:58.074 --> 50:01.575
tell us what happened on
the night of October 24th.

50:01.677 --> 50:05.979
I left my parents'
house in my father's taxi

50:06.082 --> 50:08.515
to go to a party in Manhattan.

50:08.617 --> 50:11.318
I got lost.

50:11.420 --> 50:13.754
And Andrea got into the back of the cab,

50:13.856 --> 50:16.790
thinking I was a real cab driver.

50:16.892 --> 50:19.360
We drove uptown. We talked.

50:19.462 --> 50:22.229
She gave me
something, some... some pill.

50:22.331 --> 50:26.367
We went back to her place, and we drank.

50:26.469 --> 50:29.670
She gave me something else, some powder.

50:31.040 --> 50:34.208
We, uh... we went up to her bedroom.

50:34.310 --> 50:37.144
We had sex.

50:37.246 --> 50:39.680
And then?

50:57.800 --> 50:59.400
And then...

51:00.336 --> 51:04.671
(soft panting)

51:04.774 --> 51:10.210
Then I fell asleep and
woke up in the kitchen.

51:10.312 --> 51:12.813
I went back up to the bedroom

51:12.915 --> 51:17.618
to get my clothes and say goodbye.

51:19.355 --> 51:21.522
Then I went to her...

51:24.059 --> 51:26.860
and I saw that she was dead.

51:31.867 --> 51:34.268
I... I panicked. I ran.

51:35.771 --> 51:37.404
And?

51:37.506 --> 51:39.973
And, uh...

51:44.580 --> 51:47.714
(floorboards creaking)

51:53.088 --> 51:56.223
That's all I remember.

51:58.360 --> 52:02.463
(whispering) Are you kidding me?

52:02.565 --> 52:06.099
Are you kidding me?

52:08.737 --> 52:11.505
Ask him again.

52:11.607 --> 52:14.475
You drank, took drugs,

52:14.577 --> 52:17.311
had sex, and...

52:19.715 --> 52:20.881
killed her.

52:20.983 --> 52:23.450
No. No, I didn't.

52:26.355 --> 52:28.822
Then what the hell are
you pleading guilty to?

52:30.593 --> 52:34.561
Okay. What else we got here today?

52:34.663 --> 52:37.231
Alison: You are an idiot.
You have fucked yourself.

52:37.333 --> 52:40.067
Right now, out there, that
prosecutor, that sweet lady,

52:40.169 --> 52:42.536
is sharpening her knife, and
the judge is gonna help her

52:42.638 --> 52:44.905
murder you for making them go to trial.

52:45.007 --> 52:47.441
And, frankly, I feel like
killing you myself.

52:47.543 --> 52:49.943
- So quit.
- What?

52:50.045 --> 52:54.681
- What did you say?
- Quit.

52:54.783 --> 52:56.884
I should.

52:58.888 --> 53:02.256
In fact, I do. I quit.

53:02.358 --> 53:04.191
Gate.

53:20.843 --> 53:23.911
Alison: My firm will continue to
work for your son's exoneration,

53:24.013 --> 53:26.079
but two things will change.

53:26.181 --> 53:29.650
Nasir's primary attorney
will now be Ms. Kapoor,

53:29.752 --> 53:33.320
and given that we're now
facing what will be a complex trial,

53:33.422 --> 53:38.559
I can no longer offer
you our services pro bono.

53:41.897 --> 53:46.266
Of course, you're free to decline
and seek counsel elsewhere.

53:47.803 --> 53:49.703
(rock music playing)

53:49.805 --> 53:52.406
(line ringing)

53:55.911 --> 53:57.544
- Man on phone: Westside Animal.
- Yeah.

53:57.646 --> 54:00.380
I'm, uh, calling about a cat.

54:00.482 --> 54:04.985
It's an ugly sort of orange thing.

54:05.087 --> 54:06.753
Man: Are you the guy with the feet?

54:06.855 --> 54:08.288
Right. The guy with the feet.

54:08.390 --> 54:10.390
That's me.

54:10.492 --> 54:12.926
Yeah. I'll hold.

54:13.028 --> 54:18.465
(dogs barking)

54:27.476 --> 54:29.610
- Man: It's still here.
- It's still there?

54:29.712 --> 54:33.146
- Man: You want him?
- No, I don't want it.

54:33.248 --> 54:34.748
I'm just, you know, checking.

54:34.850 --> 54:38.385
- Man: Okay.
- Okay? Thanks.

54:43.192 --> 54:44.992
Man: You stuck to your guns.

54:45.961 --> 54:47.794
That's good.

54:47.896 --> 54:49.630
That's rare.

54:49.732 --> 54:53.233
Maybe you'll get lucky, and the
judge will screw up with you, too.

54:53.335 --> 54:56.637
Well, I didn't take the
plea 'cause I didn't do it.

54:56.739 --> 54:58.238
Yeah.

54:58.340 --> 55:03.577
That's what he said, too,
my niece's killer.

55:03.679 --> 55:07.347
You didn't do it. He didn't do it.

55:07.449 --> 55:10.450
I guess don't nobody do shit, huh?

55:10.552 --> 55:14.054
This joint is so chock-a-block
with "I didn't do it" motherfuckers,

55:14.156 --> 55:17.124
they falling from the rafters.

55:20.696 --> 55:23.196
Charlene.

55:25.000 --> 55:28.802
- What?
- My niece.

55:28.904 --> 55:31.772
Her name was Charlene.

55:32.975 --> 55:37.611
And this... this is for her.

55:37.713 --> 55:42.249
(gasping) Fuck! Fuck!

55:42.351 --> 55:46.086
(groaning)

55:46.188 --> 55:48.388
(inhales sharply)

55:48.490 --> 55:50.290
Who was it?

55:50.392 --> 55:53.827
I don't know. It was dark.

55:53.962 --> 55:56.663
I asked you a question.

55:56.765 --> 55:58.999
I answered it.

56:29.665 --> 56:32.032
(chuckles)

56:48.183 --> 56:51.284
(inaudible)

57:35.130 --> 57:37.964
(keys jingling)

57:48.177 --> 57:51.511
Say the words for me, Nasir.

57:53.882 --> 57:56.283
I need your help.
