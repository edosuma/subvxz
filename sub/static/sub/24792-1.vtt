00:53.776 --> 00:56.514
Whoo!

01:19.603 --> 01:20.672
Shit.

02:16.092 --> 02:18.626
You know, I think that...

02:18.628 --> 02:21.862
- They asked me to, right?
- No.

02:21.864 --> 02:22.966
You know?

02:33.109 --> 02:34.910
The hill?

02:34.912 --> 02:36.977
It's good you're late.

02:36.979 --> 02:39.079
You're getting too thin.
Eat something.

02:39.081 --> 02:40.884
Where is she?

02:45.521 --> 02:48.457
I became completely gluten-free,

02:48.459 --> 02:51.625
which for me was
a definite journey.

02:51.627 --> 02:53.462
Wait, was this
because of an allergy?

02:53.464 --> 02:54.995
Oh, no, no, nothing like that.

02:54.997 --> 02:57.065
Oh, that's good.
I'd be so concerned.

02:57.067 --> 02:58.899
There's a lot of food
that has gluten.

03:09.979 --> 03:11.448
You're spectacular.

03:12.249 --> 03:13.849
And you're sweaty.

03:16.919 --> 03:18.789
Stop it.

03:20.190 --> 03:22.057
Stop it.

03:22.059 --> 03:23.593
Stop it!

03:24.794 --> 03:26.827
Stop, stop, stop it!

03:26.829 --> 03:28.929
Oh! Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

03:28.931 --> 03:30.631
Sorry. Stop it.

03:30.633 --> 03:32.436
Oh!

03:35.906 --> 03:38.239
He's brilliant with dogs.
He coaches them professionally.

03:38.241 --> 03:39.741
May I?

03:39.743 --> 03:42.110
- Oh, my.
- Here we go.

03:42.112 --> 03:43.778
There we go.

03:43.780 --> 03:45.946
Aw.

03:45.948 --> 03:48.517
All right. You see, she...

03:48.519 --> 03:51.152
She thinks my shoe hitting
the floor is an act of God.

03:51.154 --> 03:53.220
Now she associates that
unpleasant noise with barking.

03:53.222 --> 03:55.725
She's actually really sweet.

03:57.026 --> 04:01.563
No one has ever called
my dog sweet.

04:01.565 --> 04:03.964
You must be Alex.

04:03.966 --> 04:05.799
Uh, you must be Victoria.

04:05.801 --> 04:08.602
Yes.

04:12.074 --> 04:13.173
Are you all right?

04:13.175 --> 04:15.243
Yeah, just a little allergic.

04:15.245 --> 04:16.778
I'll be fine.

04:16.779 --> 04:19.047
You are going to come with me.

04:19.048 --> 04:20.216
I'm going to show you off.

04:22.652 --> 04:24.254
Hello, everybody.

04:29.792 --> 04:32.562
Really see it. Picture it.
Picture a coin.

04:34.564 --> 04:35.699
Picture a coin.

04:38.135 --> 04:39.504
There we go.

04:42.972 --> 04:44.275
What would be really great...

04:45.876 --> 04:47.775
is if it were something...

04:48.946 --> 04:50.210
...that I could give
to my lady.

04:50.212 --> 04:52.148
Oh!

05:09.333 --> 05:11.999
You know, I'm starting
to like your, uh,

05:12.001 --> 05:13.537
bizarre, insane...

05:14.638 --> 05:16.071
sometimes pretentious friends.

05:16.073 --> 05:18.038
Well, you know,
there's some very talented,

05:18.040 --> 05:19.174
powerful people here.

05:19.176 --> 05:20.674
Yeah?

05:20.676 --> 05:22.643
There he is. Hey, buddy.

05:22.645 --> 05:23.980
How you doing?

05:25.082 --> 05:27.182
Dave, what a sight?

05:27.184 --> 05:30.085
Oh. Uh-huh.

05:30.087 --> 05:31.920
Oh. Hey.

05:31.922 --> 05:33.955
This is a great party, really.

05:33.957 --> 05:35.826
Okay. Thank you.

05:40.063 --> 05:41.963
You do realize that
he presses up against me,

05:41.965 --> 05:45.199
he rubs back and forth, pressing
his chest into my boobs, right?

05:45.201 --> 05:47.335
He-He's just really excited
to see you.

05:50.140 --> 05:52.643
I'll talk to him. Again.

05:58.849 --> 06:01.049
Hmm. I'm getting myself
another martini.

06:01.051 --> 06:02.117
Anyone want anything?

06:02.119 --> 06:03.684
A Sapphire and tonic.

06:03.686 --> 06:04.919
Cosmopolitan.

06:04.921 --> 06:06.787
Alex, how about a real drink?

06:06.789 --> 06:09.891
Are you fine with your
non-alcoholic gay cranberry thing?

06:09.893 --> 06:10.928
It's not gay.

06:12.294 --> 06:14.929
When one person doesn't drink,
it's such a buzzkill.

06:14.931 --> 06:16.200
It brings everyone down.

06:24.374 --> 06:25.743
- Hmm.
- Okay.

06:31.681 --> 06:34.049
I look like a piece of shit
next to her.

06:34.051 --> 06:36.083
No, you don't.

06:36.085 --> 06:37.187
I do.

06:41.124 --> 06:42.292
Was I charming and likable?

06:43.292 --> 06:44.294
Captivating.

06:45.929 --> 06:47.631
I think I am in love with her.

06:48.732 --> 06:49.931
Wow.

06:49.933 --> 06:51.432
That's huge. You hate women.

06:51.434 --> 06:54.468
True. I come from a long line
of women-haters.

06:54.470 --> 06:56.136
My grandmother
didn't like women,

06:56.138 --> 06:58.306
my mother didn't, and I don't.

06:58.308 --> 06:59.807
But Katherine,

06:59.809 --> 07:01.342
I mean, she has
a beautiful voice,

07:01.344 --> 07:03.845
a nice laugh,
no irritating quirks,

07:03.847 --> 07:06.213
and a good enough personality.

07:06.215 --> 07:08.249
She's perfect, right?

07:08.251 --> 07:10.951
And I love that
she doesn't despise me

07:10.953 --> 07:12.420
like your other girlfriends.

07:12.422 --> 07:14.325
Remember Robyn?

07:16.926 --> 07:18.292
I will never forget her.

07:18.294 --> 07:20.261
She looked at me with that
homicidal glare in her eye.

07:20.263 --> 07:22.297
Yeah. She was a great cook.

07:22.299 --> 07:23.299
She was.

07:27.270 --> 07:28.339
Well, I mean,

07:29.905 --> 07:31.773
why isn't Katherine
with one of these

07:31.775 --> 07:33.874
handsome, wealthy guys then?

07:33.876 --> 07:37.045
Because she doesn't want
the good-looking studs.

07:37.047 --> 07:38.480
She wants you.

07:38.482 --> 07:41.850
She loves your old-fashioned
sense of chivalry.

07:41.852 --> 07:42.917
You're a gentleman.

07:42.919 --> 07:43.921
All right.

07:45.955 --> 07:47.258
- Check this out.
- Hmm?

07:51.160 --> 07:52.326
Oh...

07:52.328 --> 07:54.431
Oh, my God. Alex.

07:56.232 --> 07:57.398
It's stunning.

07:57.400 --> 07:58.799
It's my grandmother's.

07:58.801 --> 08:00.201
Wow.

08:00.203 --> 08:01.436
When are you gonna
give it to her?

08:02.873 --> 08:04.506
What's going on in here?

08:04.508 --> 08:06.807
Uh, um...

08:06.809 --> 08:08.208
Michael's had
too much to drink.

08:08.210 --> 08:10.280
They have to do this shot
exactly at nine o'clock, so...

08:13.116 --> 08:15.449
Yeah, I'm on another
IVF cycle.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.985
- The seventh one.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

08:17.987 --> 08:19.487
Well, at least you have Nicky.

08:19.489 --> 08:21.556
I know, but, um,

08:21.558 --> 08:24.359
one is just not enough.

08:24.361 --> 08:25.396
You'll see.

08:27.998 --> 08:29.263
You know what?
Let me do it.

08:29.265 --> 08:30.900
I bet I can do it better.

08:32.268 --> 08:33.900
I bet she can.

08:33.903 --> 08:36.273
I mean, I'm sure this is fun
for you in some way, but...

08:41.977 --> 08:43.080
All right.

08:49.286 --> 08:50.755
Oh, you poor thing.

08:52.088 --> 08:53.822
Make sure you blow on it.

08:53.824 --> 08:54.825
Okay.

08:59.095 --> 09:00.397
Just stick it in.

09:07.571 --> 09:08.973
Slowly.

09:13.609 --> 09:15.211
I have to ask you, Lily.

09:17.113 --> 09:19.917
How did you know
that Michael was the one?

09:20.984 --> 09:23.153
That is a very good question.

09:25.855 --> 09:28.057
And I think I know
where you're going.

09:32.095 --> 09:33.928
Okay.

09:33.930 --> 09:36.333
I discovered when you have
to make a tough decision,

09:37.367 --> 09:39.400
you do it from the heart.

09:39.402 --> 09:41.269
I know, most people think

09:41.271 --> 09:43.304
the heart is purely
an emotional organ,

09:43.306 --> 09:44.539
but it's not.

09:44.541 --> 09:46.940
It's actually quite cold
and unemotional.

09:46.942 --> 09:49.109
It's logical,
but it knows what's best.

09:49.111 --> 09:51.312
More than the brain sometimes.

09:51.314 --> 09:53.484
You just... you have to know
what you want in a man.

09:54.584 --> 09:56.353
You could even write it down.

10:00.056 --> 10:01.358
He is not going to propose.

10:10.532 --> 10:12.666
Yes, he is.

10:12.668 --> 10:14.569
He's a child.

10:14.571 --> 10:17.170
Hangs onto you
like you're his mommy.

10:17.172 --> 10:19.909
Runs to you when there is
the slightest crisis.

10:22.177 --> 10:24.547
I can see why you only
dated him three times.

10:27.249 --> 10:28.585
Actually, it was four.

10:31.086 --> 10:33.323
And he pretends Nicky's his son.
He's my boy.

10:35.358 --> 10:37.291
He's lonely.

10:37.293 --> 10:39.128
He doesn't have any family.

10:40.363 --> 10:41.398
I know he doesn't.

10:42.431 --> 10:44.234
And I want him to get there.

10:45.634 --> 10:47.604
- Hmm. You smell good.
- Hmm.

10:49.239 --> 10:51.208
You know Katherine's not gonna
put up with this.

10:53.609 --> 10:55.311
Why do you?

10:56.713 --> 10:59.483
Because I have... this.

11:15.264 --> 11:17.300
You and Dave are so different.

11:21.003 --> 11:24.738
Yeah. He's one of those friends
you inherit from childhood.

11:24.740 --> 11:26.210
There for life.

11:29.144 --> 11:30.346
I'm sorry.

11:35.752 --> 11:37.186
I know he's crude.

11:38.455 --> 11:40.420
But he looks out for me,

11:40.422 --> 11:42.125
and I look out for him.

11:59.142 --> 12:00.244
Come here, buddy.

12:01.411 --> 12:02.513
Come here.

12:04.781 --> 12:06.514
Use it up, buddy.

12:06.516 --> 12:07.618
Use it up.

12:08.685 --> 12:10.054
Use it up.

12:14.724 --> 12:15.756
Hey.

12:17.226 --> 12:18.261
Mail?

12:19.595 --> 12:21.130
Good boy!

12:22.197 --> 12:23.530
Good boy. Bring it here.

12:23.532 --> 12:25.266
Bring it here, bud.

12:25.268 --> 12:26.369
Good boy.

12:31.608 --> 12:34.308
Remember Katherine's brother?
Gary?

12:34.310 --> 12:35.412
The weird guy.

12:36.613 --> 12:37.681
He's getting married.

12:39.449 --> 12:40.517
Maybe I could bring you.

12:42.351 --> 12:43.353
Come on.

12:51.127 --> 12:52.426
You ready to go to work?

12:58.133 --> 12:59.666
Does he ever
walk around like he's drunk?

12:59.668 --> 13:00.703
Yes.

13:04.740 --> 13:06.776
Prolonged staring
where nothing distracts him?

13:08.644 --> 13:09.779
Sometimes.

13:12.114 --> 13:13.484
Bang his head against the wall?

13:14.850 --> 13:16.186
Yes.

13:19.189 --> 13:20.554
Does he eat his own feces?

13:20.556 --> 13:22.556
Not that I'm aware of.

13:25.260 --> 13:27.527
Well, Gumball here,

13:27.529 --> 13:29.764
he's experiencing anxiety.

13:29.766 --> 13:31.368
We're gonna find out why.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.135
Take a deep breath.

13:35.370 --> 13:37.405
We're just gonna go
in one smooth movement.

13:37.407 --> 13:38.539
- All right.
- It's all good.

13:38.541 --> 13:39.841
- Smooth.
- Smooth.

13:39.843 --> 13:41.641
- Smooth.
- Smooth.

13:41.643 --> 13:43.144
Smooth movements.

13:43.146 --> 13:44.712
It's all good.
Just like...

13:44.714 --> 13:46.247
Look, he's fine.

13:46.249 --> 13:48.116
- Enzo's good. He's good.
- What if he bites me?

13:48.118 --> 13:50.251
He's not gonna bite you. I promise you.
He's not gonna bite you.

13:50.253 --> 13:52.120
- Okay.
- He's not gonna bite anybody.

13:52.122 --> 13:53.753
- Promise?
- I promise you.

13:53.755 --> 13:54.725
Let's do it.

14:21.618 --> 14:22.853
Good boy.

14:24.186 --> 14:25.288
Good boy.

14:31.494 --> 14:33.261
Isn't that the one that bit you?

14:33.263 --> 14:34.330
Sure is.

14:35.465 --> 14:36.800
You never cease to amaze me.

14:38.334 --> 14:39.900
Wanna grab an early bite?

14:39.902 --> 14:41.434
Can't. I have a date.

14:41.436 --> 14:42.672
Can I come?

14:44.740 --> 14:46.375
I'm proposing
to Katherine tonight.

14:49.378 --> 14:51.348
Oh. I hope she doesn't say no.

14:52.614 --> 14:54.448
- I've never had anyone say yes.
- Hmm.

14:54.450 --> 14:56.383
Sir!

14:56.385 --> 14:58.419
You kid is playing
with your dog's shit.

14:58.421 --> 14:59.786
You might want
to clean that up.

15:08.797 --> 15:12.369
Here's the appetizer menu that you wanted.

15:14.369 --> 15:17.438
- Just let me know if you need anything.
- Thank you.

15:17.440 --> 15:19.209
I recommend
the calamari.

15:27.917 --> 15:29.253
So this dog...

15:30.787 --> 15:33.753
Uh... Yeah, he, um...

15:33.755 --> 15:36.256
Anyway, he's just... he's like
getting more and more anxious,

15:36.258 --> 15:37.724
and I think he's gonna
have to go on

15:37.726 --> 15:39.459
anxiety medicine
or something like that.

15:39.461 --> 15:40.660
Oh, my God.

15:40.662 --> 15:42.465
- Yeah.
- That's really serious.

15:57.312 --> 15:59.949
Alex, you're the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

16:02.985 --> 16:05.621
You take me seriously.
You listen to me.

16:07.556 --> 16:08.758
You think I'm smart.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.296
You make me laugh.

16:15.665 --> 16:18.632
I thought about this.

16:18.634 --> 16:22.303
Methodically. From my heart.

16:22.305 --> 16:23.507
I wrote it down.

16:29.311 --> 16:31.681
And what I'm trying to say is...

16:34.584 --> 16:35.852
let's go the distance.

16:48.498 --> 16:50.530
Oh, and don't take
any of this as criticism.

16:50.532 --> 16:52.967
These are just
well-thought-out suggestions.

16:52.969 --> 16:55.336
Think of them as observations.

16:55.338 --> 16:57.371
Like, um, this first one.

16:57.373 --> 16:58.506
Get teeth whitened.

16:58.508 --> 17:00.073
Don't be embarrassed by it.

17:00.075 --> 17:01.474
A lot of people have
this problem.

17:01.476 --> 17:03.010
Yellow, dullish looking teeth.

17:03.012 --> 17:05.680
It can make one look
a little older.

17:05.682 --> 17:07.579
I get them done
every six months.

17:07.582 --> 17:08.848
As you know.

17:08.849 --> 17:11.786
This next one is very fun

17:11.788 --> 17:12.954
and a no-brainer.

17:14.089 --> 17:15.454
Upgrade wardrobe.

17:15.457 --> 17:18.459
You've this great,
perfect body for clothes.

17:18.461 --> 17:20.027
Let's show it off.

17:20.029 --> 17:21.765
And I'm a soon-to-be designer.

17:23.098 --> 17:26.368
Okay, three,
I'm very excited about.

17:27.904 --> 17:30.370
Like sports.

17:30.372 --> 17:31.571
I mean, come on,
let's be honest.

17:31.573 --> 17:33.907
Gary did not quite turn out
to be the son my dad wanted.

17:33.909 --> 17:36.444
I was the one who grew up
loving sports.

17:36.446 --> 17:37.511
Loving sports.

17:37.513 --> 17:38.913
Football, basketball, baseball.

17:38.915 --> 17:40.815
Soon as I hear
Al Michaels' voice,

17:40.817 --> 17:42.817
I go straight back
to those halcyon days

17:42.819 --> 17:44.751
where my dad and I are
arguing and cussing,

17:44.753 --> 17:47.088
and he's downing a whole bottle
of California Red

17:47.090 --> 17:48.556
and throwing the remote
at the TV.

17:48.558 --> 17:51.658
I mean,
you are a sports guy.

17:51.660 --> 17:54.994
Just you like the ones that
aren't on the major networks.

17:54.996 --> 17:57.732
Like Snooker. Just,
you know, if you just try

17:57.734 --> 18:00.033
to like the sports
that other people know about,

18:00.035 --> 18:01.638
my dad...

18:02.671 --> 18:05.539
will be yours for life.

18:05.541 --> 18:08.378
And that's something we can do
together every Sunday night.

18:09.645 --> 18:10.714
With my dad.

18:23.792 --> 18:27.161
And, Alex, really, if there is
anything you want me to change,

18:27.163 --> 18:29.463
anything you want me to change,

18:29.465 --> 18:30.500
I-I will do it.

18:31.767 --> 18:33.536
I don't want you
to change a thing.

18:36.705 --> 18:39.743
I really think we can have one of those
great relationships of all-time.

18:42.844 --> 18:45.481
You know what would really be
the icing on the cake?

18:46.515 --> 18:47.548
No.

18:47.550 --> 18:49.783
If we could finish this...

18:49.785 --> 18:51.554
in time for Gary's wedding.

19:00.663 --> 19:02.930
You know what? That's perfect.

19:02.932 --> 19:04.434
That's perfect.

19:05.801 --> 19:08.068
You know why? Because
everybody's gonna be there.

19:08.070 --> 19:10.671
All your friends,
your relatives,

19:10.673 --> 19:11.871
your family members.

19:11.873 --> 19:13.540
Everybody that's important
in your life.

19:13.542 --> 19:16.911
No, I just... I want...

19:16.913 --> 19:19.446
them to see the kind of couple
that we can be.

19:19.448 --> 19:21.752
Yeah. No. Of course, that's...

19:23.051 --> 19:24.388
obviously...

19:26.522 --> 19:28.688
what this thing is about.

19:28.690 --> 19:31.157
Showing all of them,
all those important people

19:31.159 --> 19:33.194
how great you are.

19:33.196 --> 19:34.830
No, I'm sorry,
how great we are.

19:35.831 --> 19:37.063
Right?

19:37.065 --> 19:39.466
You know what?
Let's treat this like a game.

19:39.468 --> 19:41.071
Right? Come on!

20:46.836 --> 20:50.937
You remember that Russian girl
I was emailing a while back?

20:50.939 --> 20:52.740
One who loves dogs?

21:24.840 --> 21:27.607
Hello, my love, Alex.

21:27.609 --> 21:30.344
You are ray of light
on my heart.

21:30.346 --> 21:32.579
Yes, I give to you pardons

21:32.581 --> 21:34.615
that long you not writes to me.

21:34.617 --> 21:36.884
"You imagine dream today

21:36.886 --> 21:38.751
"has dreamed me.

21:38.753 --> 21:40.921
It was such bright and fine."

21:41.991 --> 21:43.190
"I am at home.

21:43.192 --> 21:44.657
"You enter my room,

21:44.659 --> 21:46.894
and I feel your aroma."

21:47.964 --> 21:49.797
"You cautiously place me
in a sofa

21:49.799 --> 21:51.065
"to unbutton me.

21:51.067 --> 21:53.733
"The dress and your soft hands

21:53.735 --> 21:57.271
start to caress
my breasts softly."

21:57.273 --> 21:59.772
Oh! "And our bodies
merge as a whole

21:59.774 --> 22:02.742
"and you compress me
so strong.

22:02.744 --> 22:04.912
"Then we start
to be borrowed love.

22:04.914 --> 22:08.084
About as I would like that
this dream appeared the truth."

22:11.219 --> 22:14.088
What the hell are you doing?

22:14.090 --> 22:15.822
I thought you stopped
emailing the Russian

22:15.824 --> 22:17.259
two weeks
after you met Katherine.

22:18.260 --> 22:19.126
I did stop.

22:19.128 --> 22:21.328
You were doing that
out of loneliness,

22:21.330 --> 22:23.097
and you're not
the lonely guy anymore.

22:23.099 --> 22:24.964
What's wrong with keeping
my options open?

22:24.966 --> 22:27.166
Options? Uh, what are you
talking about?

22:27.168 --> 22:29.970
She's a nurse from Ivanovka,

22:29.972 --> 22:31.871
in the Kirov area.

22:31.873 --> 22:33.040
That's interesting.

22:33.042 --> 22:34.343
Wait a minute.

22:35.645 --> 22:37.080
What happened?

22:43.084 --> 22:44.084
Did she, um,

22:44.086 --> 22:45.351
say anything as to how
she came up with this?

22:45.353 --> 22:50.626
Uh, something about the heart
being smarter than the brain.

22:51.961 --> 22:53.096
Oh my.

22:55.063 --> 22:56.963
Jesus!

22:56.965 --> 22:59.098
I mean,
this is really incredible.

22:59.100 --> 23:00.667
I just didn't expect this.

23:00.669 --> 23:02.935
I know. The audacity of it.

23:02.937 --> 23:04.137
I mean, it's humiliating.

23:04.139 --> 23:06.773
No. No, it's not humiliating.

23:06.775 --> 23:09.012
It's actually quite brilliant.

23:10.079 --> 23:11.444
It makes me sound like a loser.

23:11.446 --> 23:14.013
Well, what she's saying is,
she wants to marry you.

23:14.015 --> 23:15.382
Uh, no, no, no, no.

23:15.384 --> 23:17.984
I don't... I don't see that
in any way at all.

23:17.986 --> 23:20.753
No woman would give a guy
a list like this

23:20.755 --> 23:24.224
unless she wanted to be with him
for the rest of her life.

23:24.760 --> 23:26.326
Hmm?

23:26.328 --> 23:28.896
And every woman has a list.

23:28.898 --> 23:30.399
She just wrote it down.

23:36.738 --> 23:38.641
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

23:45.715 --> 23:47.216
That's my dad's root beer.

23:48.751 --> 23:50.020
Oh, Michael's home.

23:51.052 --> 23:52.254
Let's see what he thinks.

23:54.189 --> 23:56.025
This ought to be good.

24:02.997 --> 24:04.798
She expects Alex
to become a Jew?

24:04.800 --> 24:07.467
People convert
all the time, Michael.

24:07.469 --> 24:09.738
And Judaism is
a beautiful religion.

24:11.372 --> 24:13.406
Why is number seven crossed out?

24:13.408 --> 24:16.009
That's "Replace male friend
who is a bad influence."

24:16.011 --> 24:17.744
You mean me? Fuck her.

24:17.746 --> 24:20.180
- No, no. Dave.
- She means Dave.

24:20.182 --> 24:23.349
We crossed it out,
so he's not gonna do that one.

24:23.351 --> 24:24.420
Okay.

24:26.155 --> 24:27.354
"Get teeth whitened."

24:27.356 --> 24:29.125
What about Alex's
lifelong dentist phobia.

24:30.792 --> 24:32.158
That's no joke.

24:32.160 --> 24:34.263
- Very serious.
- We'll help him through it.

24:35.363 --> 24:36.396
Look, Alex.

24:40.535 --> 24:43.439
If a woman gave me this list,
this is what I would say to her:

24:45.174 --> 24:47.441
"You do know
if I make these changes,

24:47.443 --> 24:49.041
"I won't love you anymore.

24:49.043 --> 24:51.310
"I love you because
you love my faults.

24:51.312 --> 24:53.113
"If I fix them,

24:53.115 --> 24:56.015
"I'd have to raise my standards,
and you won't make the cut.

24:56.017 --> 24:59.019
Now do you really want
to hand me that list?"

24:59.021 --> 25:00.190
Wait a minute.

25:01.423 --> 25:03.190
Men expect women to be perfect.

25:03.192 --> 25:04.457
Like, all the time.

25:04.459 --> 25:06.092
You expect us
to have perky tits,

25:06.094 --> 25:09.029
firm asses, and perfectly
symmetrical facial features.

25:09.031 --> 25:10.864
And then you expect us
to have your kids,

25:10.866 --> 25:13.533
and then have our bodies
go back to looking great.

25:13.535 --> 25:14.835
And we're not allowed to age.

25:14.837 --> 25:15.869
Not a sag, not a wrinkle.

25:15.871 --> 25:17.570
So do not tell me
Katherine did anything wrong.

25:17.572 --> 25:19.405
How's he gonna pay
for this shit?

25:19.407 --> 25:21.410
Well, remember the money
his parents left him.

25:23.212 --> 25:25.846
This could be good
strategically.

25:25.848 --> 25:28.315
If you do Katherine's list,
you'll have leverage over her.

25:28.317 --> 25:29.482
She'll owe you.

25:29.484 --> 25:32.019
Oh, honey,
always so Machiavellian.

25:32.021 --> 25:34.855
Alex, if you don't do this,

25:34.857 --> 25:36.359
you'll regret it.

25:50.238 --> 25:51.972
And why is
number seven crossed out?

25:51.974 --> 25:56.042
Uh, it's "Replace male friend
who's a bad influence."

25:56.044 --> 25:57.911
You mean me?

25:57.913 --> 25:58.779
Oh, fuck her.

25:58.781 --> 26:01.415
No, no, no.
She means, uh, Michael.

26:01.417 --> 26:03.319
Oh, okay.

26:04.419 --> 26:06.185
Look, dude, Alex,

26:06.187 --> 26:08.055
everybody has some weird shit.

26:08.057 --> 26:09.292
I guarantee you she does.

26:10.326 --> 26:11.390
Like what?

26:11.392 --> 26:13.862
How about that
she gave you a list?

26:15.430 --> 26:17.463
This is my life, okay?

26:17.465 --> 26:19.566
I'm never gonna find
another girl like this.

26:19.568 --> 26:21.538
Yes, that's one hundred
percent true.

26:32.881 --> 26:35.147
What's with
the plastic furniture, man?

26:35.149 --> 26:36.518
It's inflatable.

26:37.653 --> 26:39.286
I can pack this up
and be out of here

26:39.288 --> 26:40.921
in ten minutes
if I have to be.

26:40.923 --> 26:42.559
Jesus.

26:44.193 --> 26:45.862
Look at the way we live.

26:46.928 --> 26:48.194
This is so fucked up.

26:48.196 --> 26:49.663
No, it's not.

26:49.665 --> 26:53.200
Hey, we are youthful-ish.

26:53.202 --> 26:55.402
We're allowed to be like this.

26:55.404 --> 26:57.604
After 40, it's starts
to get pathetic,

26:57.606 --> 26:59.309
but we're still okay.

27:26.467 --> 27:28.702
Katherine's got an eye.

27:28.704 --> 27:30.203
I have an eye.

27:30.205 --> 27:33.005
I pick out my own underwear
and socks.

27:33.007 --> 27:34.473
Don't need
to pay anyone for that.

27:34.475 --> 27:35.608
Dad.

27:35.610 --> 27:37.109
You don't need to work.

27:37.111 --> 27:39.578
Uh, do it as a hobby.

27:39.580 --> 27:41.682
- I'm gonna be a designer.
- Ah.

27:41.684 --> 27:44.417
You have a very
talented daughter, my dear.

27:44.419 --> 27:45.484
Don't sell her short.

27:45.486 --> 27:46.720
Do I have to work?

27:46.722 --> 27:48.124
Yes.

27:49.257 --> 27:51.124
You're a man.

27:51.126 --> 27:53.993
Honey, you're never gonna have
to worry about money.

27:53.995 --> 27:58.298
But your... husband should
be able to support a family.

27:58.300 --> 28:01.233
Do you think that idiot with
the dogs is gonna support you?

28:01.235 --> 28:04.203
I mean, what kind
of profession is that?

28:04.205 --> 28:06.339
What's next, elephants?

28:06.341 --> 28:07.609
What about elephants?

28:28.230 --> 28:30.166
Alex is here.

28:39.774 --> 28:40.976
Hi.

28:42.043 --> 28:43.111
Hi.

28:48.149 --> 28:50.218
Well, I-I'll let you two, um...

28:53.121 --> 28:54.289
Whatever.

29:01.663 --> 29:04.630
We had to pick Nicky up
from school and then...

29:04.632 --> 29:06.599
Lily demanded to come so...

29:06.601 --> 29:07.800
Well, they should come in.

29:07.802 --> 29:10.069
No, they're fine.

29:10.071 --> 29:13.008
Um, I just wanted
to talk to you.

29:16.578 --> 29:18.645
I'm not gonna do your list.

29:18.647 --> 29:19.745
I know.

29:19.747 --> 29:21.781
I never should have asked you.

29:21.783 --> 29:22.816
It's not fair.

29:22.818 --> 29:24.651
Uh...

29:24.653 --> 29:25.819
No, no, it's not fair.

29:25.821 --> 29:29.822
To expect you to do all those
things that I wrote down,

29:29.824 --> 29:31.625
it's a lot.

29:31.627 --> 29:33.059
Yeah, it is a lot.

29:33.061 --> 29:35.395
Well, it's not. I mean...

29:35.397 --> 29:37.431
I could do them.

29:37.433 --> 29:40.099
I know. You could, very easily.
I believe in you.

29:40.101 --> 29:41.534
Yeah, that's right.

29:41.536 --> 29:45.607
I mean, I could probably do them
perfectly if I chose to.

29:48.744 --> 29:50.178
Of course.

29:53.448 --> 29:54.750
But I don't want to.

29:56.784 --> 29:58.053
Okay.

30:00.121 --> 30:01.721
Hello, Alex.

30:01.723 --> 30:04.193
Um, I just wanted to ask,

30:05.224 --> 30:06.326
your friend and her son
are still out there.

30:06.328 --> 30:08.161
Should I bring them
something to drink?

30:08.163 --> 30:10.532
Oh, don't worry about it.
I'll go get them, Mom.

30:20.842 --> 30:21.811
Hey!

30:23.244 --> 30:26.780
Uh... you didn't say
anything to Alex?

30:26.782 --> 30:27.813
About what?

30:27.815 --> 30:29.182
Our bedroom conversation.

30:29.184 --> 30:30.884
I didn't say anything about you.

30:30.886 --> 30:32.485
Okay.

30:32.487 --> 30:34.186
Look, just promise me,
you'll never tell him.

30:34.188 --> 30:36.755
I'm not gonna tell him,
but you were the inspiration.

30:36.757 --> 30:38.558
I would never have thought
to do that without you.

30:38.560 --> 30:40.292
No, no, no.

30:40.294 --> 30:42.561
I was not the inspiration.
I'm not the inspiration.

30:42.563 --> 30:43.797
You wrote the list, okay?

30:43.799 --> 30:45.665
I didn't tell you that part.

30:45.667 --> 30:48.137
You don't have to worry
about it. He's not gonna do it.

30:49.271 --> 30:50.604
He's not?

30:50.606 --> 30:54.140
Because I kinda told him
that he should.

30:54.142 --> 30:55.577
- You did? Really?
- Yes.

30:57.178 --> 30:59.282
Shouldn't we get your son
out of the hot car?

31:01.183 --> 31:03.782
Yes. Yeah. Yes.
Oh, God.

31:03.784 --> 31:05.253
That's a really good idea.

31:06.888 --> 31:09.155
Oh. Okay.

31:09.157 --> 31:10.493
This is so embarrassing.

31:12.360 --> 31:13.827
Oh!

31:13.829 --> 31:15.630
I look like a rat.

31:18.667 --> 31:20.700
I have Nicky set up
in front of the TV

31:20.702 --> 31:21.867
in the den with a treat.

31:21.869 --> 31:24.303
- Thank you.
- He's so darling.

31:24.305 --> 31:26.205
Katherine showed him
her old room,

31:26.207 --> 31:27.743
her stuffed animals.

31:29.378 --> 31:32.311
So, Gary, you excited
about the big day?

31:32.313 --> 31:34.380
What big day?

31:34.382 --> 31:35.882
- Your wedding.
- He's thrilled.

31:35.884 --> 31:37.854
Alex, do you have a minute?

31:50.698 --> 31:52.632
Something to drink?
I'm having scotch.

31:52.634 --> 31:55.338
No, I'm okay.

31:58.639 --> 31:59.641
Are you?

32:00.908 --> 32:01.878
Alex...

32:03.579 --> 32:05.214
Katherine showed me
the list.

32:06.548 --> 32:07.614
And I want you to know

32:07.616 --> 32:11.686
I wholeheartedly support
your choice not to do it.

32:14.590 --> 32:16.192
Look around.

32:17.725 --> 32:19.529
This is her world.

32:20.995 --> 32:22.598
It's not yours.

32:24.532 --> 32:25.901
She expects a lot.

32:27.369 --> 32:29.001
Too much from men.

32:29.003 --> 32:30.205
But...

32:31.505 --> 32:32.707
it's not her fault.

32:34.609 --> 32:36.178
It's mine.

32:40.349 --> 32:42.382
Let me help save you
from the pain

32:42.384 --> 32:45.454
of trying to fit in
with all of this.

32:49.358 --> 32:50.956
You're a dog guy.

32:50.958 --> 32:52.594
That's fine.

32:55.630 --> 32:57.600
We don't have any dogs.

33:07.775 --> 33:10.809
We did seven IVFs
to get one kid,

33:10.811 --> 33:13.416
and he never complained once.

33:14.549 --> 33:16.683
Each time, he had
to sit in a little room

33:16.685 --> 33:18.784
and jerk off to some 1980s porn

33:18.786 --> 33:19.985
that other men
have jerked off to.

33:19.987 --> 33:22.454
Jerking off.

33:22.456 --> 33:23.790
Been there.

33:25.327 --> 33:27.894
And then he had to put
the cup in a paper bag

33:27.896 --> 33:30.829
and walk it across the room
like a child carrying his lunch

33:30.831 --> 33:32.331
and give it to his secretary.

33:32.333 --> 33:33.936
Paper bag.

33:38.674 --> 33:40.276
What the hell was that?

33:42.343 --> 33:44.911
This is gonna be
very interesting.

34:03.732 --> 34:06.633
Oh!

34:06.635 --> 34:08.434
Wow, that's a beauty!

34:08.436 --> 34:09.871
- Thank you.
- Come on in.

34:24.618 --> 34:26.518
Everyone,

34:26.520 --> 34:30.590
may I introduce
Dr. Antonio Rosenblatt.

34:30.592 --> 34:32.695
Best optometrist
on the West Side.

34:34.061 --> 34:35.728
Buongiorno.

34:35.730 --> 34:36.831
Rosenblatt?

34:38.065 --> 34:39.666
Yeah, my father is Jewish.

34:39.668 --> 34:41.735
My, uh, mom is from Florenzia.

34:41.737 --> 34:43.536
Fascinating.

34:43.538 --> 34:44.871
Interesting.

34:44.873 --> 34:46.105
Well then, you're not
actually Jewish

34:46.107 --> 34:47.373
'cause you're mother isn't.

34:47.375 --> 34:48.944
No, no, I'm Jewish.

34:50.545 --> 34:51.981
Who is this
beautiful little man?

34:53.882 --> 34:55.882
He's mine.

34:55.884 --> 34:56.918
I'm the mother.

34:58.052 --> 34:59.853
Lily.

34:59.855 --> 35:01.820
- Does he like cars?
- Oh!

35:01.822 --> 35:03.123
Loves them.

35:03.125 --> 35:05.628
Well then, we'll take you
for a ride later on then.

35:06.694 --> 35:07.796
I would love that.

35:09.663 --> 35:12.834
- And, uh, my daughter Katherine.
- Hey.

35:14.835 --> 35:16.770
Oh, wow.

35:16.772 --> 35:20.440
What? That's my thing.
I do the magic tricks.

35:26.547 --> 35:29.084
Do not show your hand,
okay, Alex?

35:30.085 --> 35:31.518
Be strong.

35:31.520 --> 35:34.654
That big, overly Italian guy

35:34.656 --> 35:35.621
isnt' a threat.

35:35.623 --> 35:37.424
Not a threat? Come on.
Look at you.

35:37.426 --> 35:38.659
You can't even help yourself.

35:38.661 --> 35:41.661
Please, please take me for a
ride in your European car later.

35:41.663 --> 35:44.496
- Okay, stop.
- Your penis must be gargantuan

35:44.498 --> 35:45.898
just because you're Italian.

35:45.900 --> 35:48.701
Suddenly, I don't care
about my husband and my child.

35:48.703 --> 35:51.003
- Run away with me.
- Alex, stop.

35:51.005 --> 35:53.672
Stop. There's just something
about Italians, okay.

35:53.674 --> 35:54.773
- It's hard to explain.
- Oh God.

35:54.775 --> 35:56.476
All women react like this.

35:56.478 --> 35:58.177
I mean, look at him.

35:58.179 --> 35:59.779
Oof!

35:59.781 --> 36:01.815
But it doesn't
really mean anything.

36:11.025 --> 36:12.761
Good coffee goes a long way.

36:15.096 --> 36:17.967
Katherine, I'm doing the list.

36:44.893 --> 36:47.793
Well, my friend,
you have seven cavities,

36:47.795 --> 36:49.795
receding gums...

36:49.797 --> 36:51.730
- Ah!
- ...and cracked enamel.

36:51.732 --> 36:54.266
I'm not even sure
I can save that one.

36:54.268 --> 36:57.737
Also, your front incisors are
a bit rabbit-like.

36:57.739 --> 37:00.009
I'd like to file those down.

37:01.208 --> 37:02.875
Sorry.

37:02.877 --> 37:04.045
Rabbit-like.

37:05.246 --> 37:06.913
Teeth whitening comes last,

37:06.915 --> 37:08.614
after all these
other procedures.

37:08.616 --> 37:10.650
Uh, well, I appreciate
your concern

37:10.652 --> 37:11.817
for the health of his teeth.

37:11.819 --> 37:12.951
The reason we came here is

37:12.953 --> 37:15.020
for the teeth whitening.

37:15.022 --> 37:17.492
I'd like to discuss what kind
of white you'll be using.

37:18.560 --> 37:19.527
White.

37:21.128 --> 37:25.601
Well, there are other shades
and intensities and...

37:27.168 --> 37:29.205
different variations on white.
I-I'll show you.

37:31.105 --> 37:32.475
I thought this might come
in handy.

37:33.275 --> 37:34.076
See, um...

37:35.576 --> 37:37.576
eggshell white might be
a nice one.

37:37.578 --> 37:39.878
Yeah, no, that's really nice.
Uh, what about polar bear?

37:39.880 --> 37:41.146
Mm, that might be
a bit too dingy.

37:41.148 --> 37:42.949
How about something
a little closer to, ooh,

37:42.951 --> 37:44.050
nebulous white.

37:44.052 --> 37:46.552
Ooh, that...

37:46.554 --> 37:48.554
that is a very nice
neutral white.

37:48.556 --> 37:50.692
- Yeah, exactly.
- I think you're right.

37:51.692 --> 37:53.793
Polar bear.

37:53.795 --> 37:55.762
Is it polar bear or nebulous?

37:55.764 --> 37:57.633
- I think it's nebulous.
- Definitely nebulous.

38:05.674 --> 38:06.775
Open.

39:09.069 --> 39:11.971
You conquered a lifelong fear.

39:11.973 --> 39:13.405
I'm so proud of you.

39:13.407 --> 39:15.310
I'm so proud of you.

39:17.679 --> 39:19.645
Definitely less, uh,
rabbit teeth.

39:20.848 --> 39:23.349
It's outstanding.
Look, it's outstanding.

39:23.351 --> 39:24.750
Outstanding, huh?

39:24.752 --> 39:27.152
You don't need this.
Yeah, yeah, Oxycodone.

39:27.154 --> 39:28.688
You definitely
don't need all these.

39:28.690 --> 39:29.956
Yeah, I'll take a few.

39:29.958 --> 39:31.657
Oh God.

39:52.212 --> 39:53.813
It's for my parents really.

39:53.815 --> 39:55.447
You know my dad.

39:55.449 --> 39:57.886
It would make things
less complicated.

40:02.290 --> 40:05.291
Many people
stereotype Jewishness.

40:05.293 --> 40:09.829
Characterize them as nitpicky,
stingy, scheming merchants.

40:09.831 --> 40:12.331
Misers collecting diamonds,
counting money.

40:12.333 --> 40:14.067
Uttering phrases like,

40:14.069 --> 40:16.804
"Shalom, mazel tov, Oy vey"

40:17.871 --> 40:20.172
Constantly hearing about bagels,

40:20.174 --> 40:22.210
violin playing, haggling.

40:24.112 --> 40:26.145
The complaining,

40:26.147 --> 40:28.980
guilt-inflicting Jewish mother.

40:28.982 --> 40:32.150
The spoiled, materialistic
Jewish-American princess.

40:32.152 --> 40:34.689
The often meek but nice
Jewish boy.

40:35.924 --> 40:38.257
You sure you're not
anti-Semitic.

40:38.259 --> 40:40.393
That all spilled out
of your mouth a little too easy.

40:40.395 --> 40:42.962
I take umbrage at that.

40:42.964 --> 40:44.362
I am just a concerned friend

40:44.364 --> 40:46.734
who can't believe
you're doing this for a woman.

40:51.105 --> 40:52.237
Hey, remember.

40:52.239 --> 40:54.375
No more Christmas,
no more Easter Bunny.

40:55.442 --> 40:57.178
Think about it.

41:13.127 --> 41:14.763
Do you know
what it means to convert?

41:16.964 --> 41:18.100
Uh, you...

41:21.935 --> 41:23.071
become a Jew.

41:24.304 --> 41:26.274
It's a little more complicated
than that.

41:28.042 --> 41:29.444
I've known the Sterns for...

41:30.511 --> 41:31.714
over 20 years.

41:32.813 --> 41:34.082
I've watched Katherine grow up.

41:35.784 --> 41:39.418
Yes, she's spoiled,
and she has a good heart.

41:39.420 --> 41:41.956
And she certainly knows
what she wants.

41:44.225 --> 41:45.293
Do you?

41:50.964 --> 41:51.933
Sometimes.

41:54.101 --> 41:56.434
You know that
it is my job

41:56.436 --> 41:59.237
to dissuade you from converting?

41:59.239 --> 42:01.873
I'm committed to protecting
the Jewish religion

42:01.875 --> 42:03.044
and the Jewish people.

42:04.212 --> 42:06.179
My personal feeling is
to welcome people

42:06.181 --> 42:07.750
to this beautiful faith.

42:10.250 --> 42:11.449
But...

42:11.451 --> 42:14.020
if they are not serious...

42:14.022 --> 42:16.588
or they have
stereotypical ideas, beliefs...

42:16.590 --> 42:18.523
Oh, no, no. No, no.
I-I am serious.

42:18.525 --> 42:20.159
I am totally serious.

42:20.161 --> 42:22.261
I don't want to harm any Jews.

42:22.263 --> 42:24.329
I would protect them all
if I could.

42:24.331 --> 42:25.498
I respect Jews.

42:25.500 --> 42:28.034
I... I've watched Jews
my whole life.

42:28.036 --> 42:30.472
The entire Holocaust
was terrible.

42:31.505 --> 42:34.373
Ho-Horrific.

42:34.375 --> 42:36.011
It makes me sick like...

42:37.244 --> 42:39.313
uh, and... but...

42:40.915 --> 42:43.148
They've done so well
for themselves in Hollywood now.

42:43.150 --> 42:44.983
I mean, they make
all those great...

42:44.985 --> 42:45.853
movies and...

42:47.455 --> 42:49.889
That was the stupidest thing
I have said.

42:49.891 --> 42:51.527
I'm sorry I said that.
I'm babbling.

42:54.362 --> 42:56.130
What about your family?

42:59.167 --> 43:00.168
Gone.

43:02.136 --> 43:03.138
I'm sorry.

43:06.007 --> 43:08.273
I like you. You're honest.

43:08.275 --> 43:09.474
You didn't come here
and tell me

43:09.476 --> 43:10.876
what you thought
I wanted to hear.

43:10.878 --> 43:12.114
You didn't try to fool me.

43:13.147 --> 43:14.116
I'm not very good at that.

43:15.449 --> 43:17.349
All right.

43:17.351 --> 43:20.887
Let's start with the basics
and move on from there.

43:20.889 --> 43:23.456
And I think you may be surprised
at what you learn.

43:23.458 --> 43:25.023
Okay, Rabbi.

43:25.025 --> 43:26.125
Do I call you Rabbi?

43:26.127 --> 43:27.626
Yes.

43:27.628 --> 43:29.264
Did you know
rabbi means teacher?

43:30.898 --> 43:34.634
We educate people
in how to connect to God

43:34.636 --> 43:36.839
and to spirituality.

43:38.473 --> 43:39.507
I like that.

43:40.540 --> 43:42.210
The process takes
about six months.

43:43.610 --> 43:44.679
Uh, that's actually not...

43:46.447 --> 43:48.915
gonna work because I need
to be Jewish in three weeks

43:48.917 --> 43:51.050
for Gary's wedding.

43:51.052 --> 43:52.554
We'll deal with that
when we get to it.

43:54.121 --> 43:56.188
But for now, you need to study.

43:56.190 --> 43:57.623
You'll also have a mikveh,

43:57.625 --> 43:59.592
a ceremonial baptism.

43:59.594 --> 44:01.362
And you will need
to be circumcised.

44:03.331 --> 44:04.499
Oh, I am. I, uh...

44:06.134 --> 44:08.099
I believe you.

44:08.101 --> 44:10.471
It's a ritual circumcision
by a mohel.

44:12.607 --> 44:14.208
It's not as bad as it sounds.

44:16.310 --> 44:17.311
Okay.

44:25.552 --> 44:28.119
When I came here,
I hated all American sports,

44:28.121 --> 44:29.989
especially baseball.

44:29.991 --> 44:31.489
I mean, it was torture.

44:31.491 --> 44:34.192
I didn't get it, at all.

44:34.194 --> 44:37.429
Then, I started
to get to know the players.

44:37.431 --> 44:39.732
This one's married.
This one's single.

44:39.734 --> 44:41.634
This one's good-looking.

44:41.636 --> 44:43.668
I started to see the pictures,

44:43.670 --> 44:45.438
the split finger fastball,

44:45.440 --> 44:47.909
the cutter, the sinker,
change-up.

44:48.976 --> 44:52.277
I began to understand
the strategy.

44:52.279 --> 44:55.681
I decided to change
how I felt about baseball.

44:55.683 --> 44:58.219
And now, I'm more passionate
about the game than Michael.

45:00.520 --> 45:03.121
And then, there is football,

45:03.123 --> 45:04.623
American football.

45:04.625 --> 45:07.226
There's no other sport
that makes grown-up men cry,

45:07.228 --> 45:10.195
brings them to their knees
more than football.

45:10.197 --> 45:12.998
It taps into our most
primal instincts.

45:13.000 --> 45:16.201
So, allow yourself to enjoy
the epic struggle,

45:16.203 --> 45:18.603
the spectacle that is football.

45:21.542 --> 45:23.509
Come on, run it down
their throats.

45:23.511 --> 45:25.311
Time to air it out. Go long!

45:29.116 --> 45:30.384
Maybe he should
dump it off short.

45:32.453 --> 45:33.753
- No.
- Pssh, of course not.

45:33.755 --> 45:35.624
Good try, Alex.

45:38.092 --> 45:40.226
Brady likes to stay aggressive,

45:40.228 --> 45:41.161
move it down the field.

45:41.163 --> 45:43.561
Yeah, except the defense
is expecting that.

45:43.563 --> 45:44.730
They have
their nickel package in.

45:44.732 --> 45:46.264
That's true.

45:46.266 --> 45:47.569
Brady better be careful.

45:48.569 --> 45:49.538
That was a good try, babe.

45:50.605 --> 45:52.507
Okay. Third and one.

45:53.708 --> 45:56.108
Run it off tackle.
Get the first down.

45:59.147 --> 46:02.451
Or... maybe he should fake it
into the line and go deep.

46:03.451 --> 46:06.217
Oh, that's bold, Alex.

46:06.219 --> 46:08.454
...fires
into the end zone. Touchdown!

46:11.793 --> 46:13.659
Outstanding, Alex.

46:13.661 --> 46:15.828
Good. Good work. Good...

46:15.830 --> 46:18.197
Hey, come over here.
Sit by me.

46:18.199 --> 46:19.465
Katherine, give him some room.

46:19.467 --> 46:21.233
What a touchdown by 22.

46:21.235 --> 46:22.701
He's a great football player.

46:22.703 --> 46:26.204
Unfortunately, earlier in the
season, he took a big hit.

46:26.206 --> 46:28.674
You know, I wouldn't be surprised
to see him bootleg it here.

46:28.676 --> 46:31.580
Hey, I got my own John Madden
next to me.

46:57.304 --> 46:59.572
He's so surgical
in that position.

46:59.574 --> 47:01.806
Changing up tempos like that. His
guys giving him passing lanes.

47:01.808 --> 47:04.143
Hey, Brady's got ice water
in his veins.

47:04.145 --> 47:05.311
No-flinch mentality.

47:05.313 --> 47:06.846
Damn you, Brady!

47:06.848 --> 47:08.282
I'm taking you to a game.

47:14.388 --> 47:15.424
Jesus.

47:16.723 --> 47:18.791
Fifty-yard line, ten rows back.

47:18.793 --> 47:21.293
How the hell did you get these?

47:21.295 --> 47:22.628
Go get yourself a drink.

47:22.630 --> 47:25.500
Oh, I brought you
something to drink.

47:27.201 --> 47:29.634
Wow! 1967 Bordeaux.

47:29.636 --> 47:31.505
Antonio, you didn't need
to do that.

47:36.143 --> 47:38.844
Alex, uh, why don't you open it?

47:38.846 --> 47:40.648
Or do you need some help?

47:46.186 --> 47:47.322
Tell you what.

47:48.656 --> 47:50.822
You go ahead
and open it yourself.

47:50.824 --> 47:52.558
You might wanna decant it first.

47:52.560 --> 47:54.795
Although it's probably lost
all its fruit by now.

47:58.266 --> 47:59.868
Katherine, go get him.

48:04.804 --> 48:06.808
Patriots are the forces of evil.

48:09.277 --> 48:10.744
Alex, please.

48:11.846 --> 48:13.281
Don't go.

48:24.257 --> 48:25.791
You know I didn't invite him.

48:25.793 --> 48:27.793
My dad did.

48:27.795 --> 48:29.764
He is stalking you.

48:31.199 --> 48:33.199
He's an optometrist.

48:33.201 --> 48:34.900
That's not a real doctor.

48:34.902 --> 48:37.636
The real doctor is
an ophthalmologist.

48:37.638 --> 48:40.838
Mr. Antonio Rosenblatt

48:40.840 --> 48:42.241
is a pretend doctor.

48:42.243 --> 48:43.741
He sells glasses.

48:43.743 --> 48:44.845
What a scam.

48:46.380 --> 48:47.813
And you, oh,

48:47.815 --> 48:52.351
"Yes, may I please have
some of your special wine."

48:52.353 --> 48:55.253
Because everything Italian
is automatically incredible

48:55.255 --> 48:57.556
just because it's Italian.

48:57.558 --> 48:59.692
And by the way, I'm pretty sure
he's not Italian.

48:59.694 --> 49:02.695
He sounds French to me. I don't know
why anybody else doesn't hear that.

49:02.697 --> 49:04.933
How'd you know about
the wine and the football?

49:07.634 --> 49:09.770
Because when I say I'm gonna
do something, I do it.

49:10.971 --> 49:12.406
Hundred percent.

49:13.907 --> 49:15.243
I like that.

49:18.378 --> 49:19.647
All right, uh...

49:21.348 --> 49:23.349
I guess I'll go get back
to your dad.

49:23.351 --> 49:25.186
I don't wanna be rude
or anything.

49:26.319 --> 49:27.455
I don't wanna be a dick.

49:28.755 --> 49:30.225
Where do you think you're going?

49:41.002 --> 49:45.270
I guess it is only the beginning
of the third quarter out there.

49:45.272 --> 49:46.874
My dad's never leaving
that game.

49:48.308 --> 49:50.375
And that score is pretty tight.

49:50.377 --> 49:51.976
Really tight.

49:51.978 --> 49:53.948
We have a good 32 minutes.

50:27.380 --> 50:29.947
This next one is very fun

50:29.949 --> 50:31.449
and a no-brainer.

50:31.451 --> 50:32.985
Upgrade wardrobe.

50:32.987 --> 50:35.920
You have this great,
perfect body for clothes.

50:35.922 --> 50:37.556
Let's show it off.

50:48.802 --> 50:49.837
Hmm.

51:09.489 --> 51:11.989
I'm sorry, I gotta go.
It's Victoria.

51:11.991 --> 51:13.125
Uh-oh.

51:13.127 --> 51:14.226
Wardrobe emergency?

51:14.228 --> 51:17.563
Yes. One of our big clients
who no one can stand,

51:17.565 --> 51:20.902
apparently, she hates the dress
I pulled for her.

51:22.036 --> 51:23.538
I'll get back soon as I can.

51:24.739 --> 51:26.374
I'm so sorry.

51:27.741 --> 51:29.810
But there's so many
beautiful clothes here.

51:30.810 --> 51:31.779
Have fun.

51:32.947 --> 51:35.012
Mix and match.

51:35.014 --> 51:36.114
Do whatever you want.

51:36.116 --> 51:38.052
It's gonna make you look
so handsome.

52:04.011 --> 52:06.945
I was finally getting
comfortable around Mr. Stern.

52:06.947 --> 52:08.614
Like we were bonding.

52:08.616 --> 52:09.884
We were watching football.

52:11.719 --> 52:14.953
And then this Antonio guy
comes in.

52:14.955 --> 52:16.422
He ruined everything.

52:16.424 --> 52:17.525
Ruined the whole moment.

52:21.494 --> 52:23.529
What do you think
I should do?

52:23.531 --> 52:25.831
Tell him to go away.

52:25.833 --> 52:26.898
I shouldn't punch him?

52:26.900 --> 52:29.867
Only policemen and Marines
are allowed to punch.

52:29.869 --> 52:30.869
Only what?

52:30.871 --> 52:33.070
Policemen and marines
are allowed to punch.

52:34.909 --> 52:36.511
That's a good point.

52:38.746 --> 52:40.712
We're oddballs, huh?

52:40.714 --> 52:41.782
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

52:43.683 --> 52:45.583
I think we need to be more
like Steve McQueen.

52:45.585 --> 52:46.721
Yeah.

53:01.534 --> 53:03.067
Grunters.

53:03.069 --> 53:04.037
What the hell?

53:07.507 --> 53:09.042
Look at that lame fuck.

53:20.688 --> 53:23.255
Alex, my friend!

53:23.257 --> 53:25.590
Who's he?

53:25.592 --> 53:28.494
That's the Jewish-Italian
optometrist.

53:28.496 --> 53:30.195
Clearly sounds French though.

53:30.197 --> 53:32.197
The one who wants
to get into Katherine's pants?

53:32.199 --> 53:33.635
That's the one.

53:34.634 --> 53:35.933
Look who dropped by, Alex.

53:35.935 --> 53:37.037
Great.

53:38.172 --> 53:39.507
How about we play a match?

53:41.641 --> 53:42.940
Terrific idea.

53:42.942 --> 53:44.509
That's all right.
I think we'll come back.

53:44.511 --> 53:46.545
Absolutely. Let's do this.

53:49.683 --> 53:50.851
Yea-oh!

53:52.219 --> 53:53.822
Kick their asses.

54:04.998 --> 54:07.067
Fuck me! Fuck me!

54:10.804 --> 54:12.607
Ooh!

54:16.911 --> 54:18.880
You know, Katherine is
a very special woman.

54:20.179 --> 54:21.913
She deserves the best.

54:21.915 --> 54:24.017
Oh, she's more than satisfied
with what she's got.

54:25.953 --> 54:27.184
No, she's not.

54:27.186 --> 54:28.889
What'd you say?

54:31.225 --> 54:32.627
What'd you say?

54:35.061 --> 54:36.563
My serve.

54:51.578 --> 54:52.878
Oh!

54:52.880 --> 54:54.246
- Ooh!
- Ooh.

54:57.317 --> 54:59.253
Sorry, that was an accident.

55:01.154 --> 55:02.753
Ah, you're okay.

55:02.755 --> 55:03.991
Just, uh, walk it off.

56:51.264 --> 56:52.366
Oh, Jesus.

56:54.400 --> 56:56.737
Transfers you
the greetings, my love!

57:12.085 --> 57:14.085
What the hell is she doing here?

57:14.087 --> 57:16.690
- Did you tell her to fly over?
- No, Dave, I didn't.

57:18.092 --> 57:19.994
She must've misunderstood me.

57:22.128 --> 57:24.262
Look, I gotta get out of here.

57:24.264 --> 57:26.434
Just keep here here until, uh...

57:27.768 --> 57:28.967
until I get back.

57:28.969 --> 57:30.302
I don't know how long
that's gonna be.

57:30.304 --> 57:32.304
No problem.

57:32.306 --> 57:33.838
Does she speak English?

57:33.840 --> 57:36.377
Your dog, it likes a stroke.

57:37.444 --> 57:38.946
Okay, we're good.

57:44.083 --> 57:46.817
Don't worry. I come back.

57:46.819 --> 57:47.955
Dave...

57:49.322 --> 57:51.058
good guy.

57:55.362 --> 57:58.866
What do you do in Russia?

58:00.900 --> 58:04.069
I work as the seller-advisor.

58:04.071 --> 58:06.804
To me I like
when people thank if

58:06.806 --> 58:10.808
I in what that have helped them

58:10.810 --> 58:13.447
and on them faces smile.

58:16.984 --> 58:19.416
Listen, do not mess with her.

58:19.418 --> 58:22.052
Hey, buddy, this is your thing.

58:22.054 --> 58:23.221
Now go.

58:23.223 --> 58:24.257
Beat it.

58:32.498 --> 58:35.333
To keep our relationship fresh,
we should go out every week,

58:35.335 --> 58:37.469
explore the city,
do different things.

58:37.471 --> 58:39.407
It would be like
a first date each time.

58:40.940 --> 58:43.340
Special night out every week.

58:43.342 --> 58:45.143
I haven't had one in years.

58:45.145 --> 58:46.813
I've earned it. She hasn't.

58:48.447 --> 58:51.485
All right, fine. Give her
the damn special night out.

58:56.522 --> 58:57.824
Just...

59:03.496 --> 59:04.965
Just wait.

59:14.040 --> 59:15.507
I know you wanted
to go out, but...

59:15.509 --> 59:18.043
Alex... it's beautiful.

59:18.045 --> 59:19.380
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

59:22.516 --> 59:25.217
Okay, I'm gonna go check
on the fillets in the oven.

59:25.219 --> 59:26.851
Fillets? Wow.

59:26.853 --> 59:29.987
Um, why am I not sneezing?

59:29.989 --> 59:33.925
Oh, I de-Tuckerized
the whole place.

59:33.927 --> 59:36.261
Yeah, he's gone for the evening.

59:36.263 --> 59:39.364
There is no CSI
that could find any evidence

59:39.366 --> 59:41.034
of canine DNA in here.

59:42.168 --> 59:43.300
Thank you.

59:43.302 --> 59:44.438
Yeah.

59:46.306 --> 59:48.109
I'll be just one sec.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.135
Hmm.

01:00:29.148 --> 01:00:31.282
It's from California.

01:00:31.284 --> 01:00:33.617
Heaven. How did you find that?

01:00:33.619 --> 01:00:35.455
I have my ways.

01:00:40.192 --> 01:00:42.128
I don't know
how you pulled this off.

01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.176
What's that?

01:00:57.610 --> 01:00:59.045
Holy shit.

01:01:01.248 --> 01:01:02.447
What's going on?

01:01:02.449 --> 01:01:03.551
No, no, no. Anastasiya.

01:01:05.451 --> 01:01:07.719
Go. Back. Dave. Now.

01:01:07.721 --> 01:01:10.487
I come to here.
Alex tell me.

01:01:10.489 --> 01:01:12.424
- Do you know this girl?
- No, absolutely not.

01:01:12.426 --> 01:01:13.393
But you know her name.

01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:16.695
Okay, I kind of know her.

01:01:16.697 --> 01:01:18.128
Are you having an affair?

01:01:18.130 --> 01:01:20.699
Oh, my God, no. No.

01:01:20.701 --> 01:01:22.333
I was hurt after
you gave me the list.

01:01:22.335 --> 01:01:24.302
I went online just to talk
to somebody.

01:01:24.304 --> 01:01:26.070
- She's from Russia.
- I'm from Russia.

01:01:26.072 --> 01:01:27.237
I never told her to come.

01:01:27.239 --> 01:01:29.373
- He said come.
- No, I didn't say that.

01:01:30.509 --> 01:01:31.875
I don't understand
what you're saying,

01:01:31.877 --> 01:01:34.378
but you need to get your ass out
of here before I mess you up.

01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.181
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.
- What! Stop!

01:01:37.183 --> 01:01:38.983
- Bitch!
- Hey!

01:01:38.985 --> 01:01:41.251
Russian girl. Think you're trying
to find an American husband.

01:01:41.253 --> 01:01:43.387
- Baby, what are you doing?
- Why aren't you protecting me

01:01:43.389 --> 01:01:45.025
- from this lunatic?
- I am. Just...

01:01:49.196 --> 01:01:51.496
- Get out of here. Now.
- But you said come.

01:01:51.498 --> 01:01:53.297
- Dave.
- Alex, what...

01:01:57.337 --> 01:01:58.706
So sorry about that.

01:02:12.152 --> 01:02:14.451
Okay. I know that was...

01:02:14.453 --> 01:02:15.652
weird.

01:02:15.654 --> 01:02:19.357
A Russian off the Internet?
How tacky.

01:02:19.359 --> 01:02:21.358
I told you,
it was a mistake.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:22.694
All right? I'm an idiot.

01:02:22.696 --> 01:02:24.561
Katherine, look,
I'm doing the best I can

01:02:24.563 --> 01:02:26.697
with this stupid list thing.

01:02:26.699 --> 01:02:29.034
In fact, I'm pretty sure
no other guy in the world

01:02:29.036 --> 01:02:30.300
would put himself through this.

01:02:30.302 --> 01:02:32.670
You know, I went against
all of my instincts

01:02:32.672 --> 01:02:34.438
as a man to please you.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:36.440
Oh, stupid list?

01:02:36.442 --> 01:02:38.509
You know who inspired
that stupid list?

01:02:38.511 --> 01:02:42.146
Your good old friend
you can't seem to live without.

01:02:42.148 --> 01:02:44.518
Remember my little bedroom talk
with Lily?

01:02:48.054 --> 01:02:50.690
You nailed it. What a wonderful
special night out.

01:02:59.398 --> 01:03:01.132
I didn't tell her
to give you the list.

01:03:01.134 --> 01:03:03.634
Okay? I told her that you have
to know what you want in a man

01:03:03.636 --> 01:03:05.672
and maybe write it down.

01:03:09.275 --> 01:03:10.641
Well, that's great.

01:03:10.643 --> 01:03:12.444
So you were
the inspiration then.

01:03:12.446 --> 01:03:13.777
Okay, yes!

01:03:13.779 --> 01:03:15.380
Yes, I was the inspiration,

01:03:15.382 --> 01:03:18.116
- if you want to look at it that way.
- Great.

01:03:18.118 --> 01:03:20.652
I was just trying to help you get
moving 'cause you just sit there.

01:03:20.654 --> 01:03:23.387
- You never make a decision.
- Stop acting like you're my mom.

01:03:23.389 --> 01:03:25.393
- Stop interfering.
- You need me to interfere.

01:03:28.761 --> 01:03:30.163
Oh God.

01:03:31.397 --> 01:03:34.232
Oh, I'm sorry, Alex.
I'm sorry.

01:03:34.234 --> 01:03:36.333
God, I just can't keep
my mouth shut.

01:03:36.335 --> 01:03:38.136
And I do interfere.
It's pathological.

01:03:38.138 --> 01:03:40.838
I can't help myself.
Oh God.

01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:42.540
It's just that
it's too much fun interfering.

01:03:42.542 --> 01:03:43.875
It makes me feel like
I'm part of it.

01:03:43.877 --> 01:03:45.677
Now I fucked up your future
with the perfect girl.

01:03:45.679 --> 01:03:47.314
No, no. No, no, you did not.

01:03:49.315 --> 01:03:50.784
She put chocolate on you
because of this?

01:03:51.884 --> 01:03:54.219
No, the crazy Russian.

01:03:54.221 --> 01:03:56.454
The crazy Russian,
she flew in here,

01:03:56.456 --> 01:03:58.223
found my address,
I don't know how.

01:03:58.225 --> 01:03:59.657
She scared the crap out of me.

01:03:59.659 --> 01:04:01.458
Uh, Dave was supposed
to be watching her,

01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:04.262
but she just burst in the middle
of the dinner with Katherine,

01:04:04.264 --> 01:04:06.163
starts demolishing the place,

01:04:06.165 --> 01:04:07.898
and rubs chocolate
on both of us.

01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:10.603
And now Katherine thinks I've been
having an affair with this girl.

01:04:12.438 --> 01:04:13.871
It's not...

01:04:13.873 --> 01:04:15.706
That's the funniest thing ever.

01:04:15.708 --> 01:04:18.279
You should see the dress that...

01:04:19.645 --> 01:04:21.512
I want to know exactly
what's so funny,

01:04:21.514 --> 01:04:23.614
but I already took my pill.

01:04:23.616 --> 01:04:26.150
So, Lily, come to bed.

01:04:26.152 --> 01:04:28.753
And, Alex, you'll stay
in the guest room.

01:04:28.755 --> 01:04:30.090
Okay.

01:04:33.192 --> 01:04:34.328
Good night, honey.

01:05:01.688 --> 01:05:03.190
It's pancake day.

01:05:04.891 --> 01:05:06.193
Okay.

01:05:09.362 --> 01:05:11.362
This Russian sounds wild.

01:05:11.364 --> 01:05:13.400
- Oof.
- I wanna hear every detail.

01:05:14.433 --> 01:05:15.468
But, Alex...

01:05:16.770 --> 01:05:19.237
I think under the circumstances,

01:05:19.239 --> 01:05:21.206
everything is fair game now.

01:05:21.208 --> 01:05:22.507
Who knows
about Katherine, right?

01:05:22.509 --> 01:05:24.478
Who knows what the hell
she's doing.

01:05:25.811 --> 01:05:28.148
If I were you, I would take
a look at this Russian.

01:05:29.281 --> 01:05:30.415
A good look.

01:05:31.784 --> 01:05:33.386
Test the waters.

01:05:48.435 --> 01:05:51.436
For 28 years,
I am living with Mama.

01:05:51.438 --> 01:05:53.904
She works in an agriculture.

01:05:53.906 --> 01:05:55.609
She looks after birds.

01:05:57.009 --> 01:05:58.912
From what you become happy?

01:06:01.014 --> 01:06:04.652
What to give
to your face a smile?

01:06:06.752 --> 01:06:08.321
Alex, tell to me.

01:06:10.623 --> 01:06:11.759
Uh...

01:06:13.025 --> 01:06:14.895
dogs.

01:06:16.429 --> 01:06:17.764
I love for them!

01:06:35.514 --> 01:06:36.917
Have you ever been in love?

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:42.489
Many times.

01:06:43.489 --> 01:06:45.523
But with each relationship,

01:06:45.525 --> 01:06:47.625
your idea of love changes.

01:06:47.627 --> 01:06:48.929
And I think that's a good thing.

01:06:51.831 --> 01:06:54.835
I will have
the chicken parmigiano.

01:06:55.902 --> 01:06:57.402
That-That's not Italian.

01:06:57.404 --> 01:06:58.802
Of course it is.

01:06:58.804 --> 01:07:00.438
Chicken parmigiano.

01:07:01.473 --> 01:07:02.974
Uh, no, I mean,

01:07:02.976 --> 01:07:05.576
an Italian would never take
a chicken, fry it,

01:07:05.578 --> 01:07:08.012
and put a lot of sauce
and melted cheese on it.

01:07:08.014 --> 01:07:09.450
That's just not
an Italian dish.

01:07:10.583 --> 01:07:12.817
It is to me.
I think it's delicious.

01:07:12.819 --> 01:07:14.819
It's our best-selling dish, sir.

01:07:14.821 --> 01:07:16.688
Well...

01:07:16.690 --> 01:07:19.023
I wouldn't order it.

01:07:19.025 --> 01:07:21.262
I'm sure there's
better things on this menu.

01:07:22.594 --> 01:07:23.930
Wh-Where's your chef from?

01:07:25.031 --> 01:07:27.565
Seems like Northern Italy.

01:07:27.567 --> 01:07:29.036
He's from Mexico.

01:07:30.869 --> 01:07:33.337
So this is American food?

01:07:33.339 --> 01:07:35.275
In that case,
I will have, um,

01:07:36.442 --> 01:07:37.710
New York strip, medium rare.

01:07:39.913 --> 01:07:41.878
Chicken parmigiano.

01:07:44.717 --> 01:07:46.650
I'm sorry, Katherine,
but in Italy...

01:07:46.652 --> 01:07:48.920
I know, everything in Italy
is superior.

01:07:48.922 --> 01:07:51.054
Guess we're not as persnickety
about our food

01:07:51.056 --> 01:07:52.824
because we're so busy
being a superpower.

01:07:52.826 --> 01:07:55.393
For example, in America,
we do not take a nap

01:07:55.395 --> 01:07:57.128
from 2 to 4 p.m.
because we think it's lazy

01:07:57.130 --> 01:07:58.895
and bad for business.

01:07:58.897 --> 01:08:02.535
By the way, how are
the eyeglasses selling?

01:08:04.938 --> 01:08:07.407
You're upset because
it didn't work out with Alex.

01:08:13.045 --> 01:08:15.381
You're right. I'm sorry.

01:08:19.618 --> 01:08:21.786
I know you, Katherine.

01:08:21.787 --> 01:08:23.054
You're a woman
who needs to experience

01:08:23.055 --> 01:08:24.924
the best in life.

01:08:27.794 --> 01:08:29.662
And I can give you this.

01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:39.772
I am never getting married.

01:08:41.173 --> 01:08:43.573
I made that choice
a long time ago.

01:08:43.575 --> 01:08:45.044
Makes my life a lot easier.

01:08:49.481 --> 01:08:51.616
I'm gonna pawn it.

01:08:51.618 --> 01:08:53.818
You'll regret it.

01:08:53.819 --> 01:08:55.723
Antique rings aren't worth
what you think.

01:08:56.856 --> 01:08:58.559
Nothing's worth
what you think.

01:08:59.658 --> 01:09:00.861
Hey, Alex,
can I tell you something?

01:09:02.027 --> 01:09:03.528
The reason you can't go
the distance

01:09:03.529 --> 01:09:04.630
with Katherine is that...

01:09:06.198 --> 01:09:09.167
well, she expects
more than a dog.

01:09:09.169 --> 01:09:12.670
I mean, you love dogs
because it's a one-way street.

01:09:12.671 --> 01:09:15.042
You know,
it's unconditional love.

01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:19.545
Don't pawn this.

01:09:21.013 --> 01:09:22.814
You don't wanna end up like me.

01:09:44.203 --> 01:09:46.871
Who is this hot piece of ass

01:09:46.872 --> 01:09:48.841
putting holes in my grass?

01:10:02.021 --> 01:10:03.056
Katherine.

01:10:04.857 --> 01:10:06.224
Welcome to my park.

01:10:06.226 --> 01:10:07.795
Uh, she's allergic to dogs.

01:10:09.995 --> 01:10:11.095
Well...

01:10:11.097 --> 01:10:13.200
then she shouldn't come here.

01:10:25.044 --> 01:10:27.577
Let's get you out of here before
your face turns purple and blows up.

01:10:27.579 --> 01:10:30.046
Wait, I wanna
show you something.

01:10:30.048 --> 01:10:31.282
It's a prescription.

01:10:31.284 --> 01:10:33.786
It will reduce my allergy
by 90 percent.

01:10:35.288 --> 01:10:37.287
And this you'll like.

01:10:37.289 --> 01:10:39.524
There's injections too.

01:10:39.526 --> 01:10:40.791
And you can do the honors.

01:10:40.793 --> 01:10:42.527
I think you've gotten
very good at that by now.

01:10:42.529 --> 01:10:44.628
They already
gave me my first shot,

01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:46.999
and-and I think
it's starting to kick in.

01:10:57.043 --> 01:10:58.242
Oh, my God.

01:10:58.244 --> 01:11:01.077
- It was my grandmother's.
- It's gorgeous.

01:11:03.583 --> 01:11:05.248
I kill you, bitch!

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:06.917
- Hey!
- What the hell!

01:11:06.919 --> 01:11:08.219
- Hey!
- God, help me!

01:11:08.221 --> 01:11:09.720
Get off of her!

01:11:09.722 --> 01:11:11.087
Get off of her!

01:11:11.089 --> 01:11:12.924
Look!

01:11:12.926 --> 01:11:15.062
Stop it! Listen to me!
Stop it!

01:11:17.664 --> 01:11:20.230
I got her!
I got her! I got her!

01:11:20.232 --> 01:11:21.698
Where the hell
have you been, Dave?

01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:24.335
I thought you had strict orders to
keep this lunatic under lockdown.

01:11:24.337 --> 01:11:26.604
You enjoying this?
Is this making you happy?

01:11:26.606 --> 01:11:29.340
Alex just proposed to me,
and you've ruined it.

01:11:29.342 --> 01:11:31.141
What a great friend you are.

01:11:31.143 --> 01:11:33.310
Oh God, look at
my Louis Vuitton boots.

01:11:33.312 --> 01:11:35.345
- Oh, no.
- I'll buy you another pair.

01:11:35.347 --> 01:11:36.646
You can't afford them.

01:11:36.648 --> 01:11:38.114
You always this much
of a bitch?

01:11:40.152 --> 01:11:42.219
Nyet! Nyet!

01:11:42.221 --> 01:11:44.588
Dave, stop!
Just get her out of here!

01:11:44.590 --> 01:11:45.855
All right?
I'll talk to you later.

01:11:45.857 --> 01:11:46.957
I gotta deal with this.

01:11:46.959 --> 01:11:48.594
Go! Get her out of here!

01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:56.069
This is bullshit!

01:12:01.273 --> 01:12:03.877
Oh. Okay. It's okay.

01:12:04.877 --> 01:12:05.978
We got it.

01:12:07.213 --> 01:12:09.346
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:12:09.348 --> 01:12:12.248
Uh, yeah, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't put that on.

01:12:18.725 --> 01:12:20.561
I'm not a bitch.

01:12:22.128 --> 01:12:23.597
Oh, no.

01:12:55.828 --> 01:12:57.193
My God is alive,

01:12:57.195 --> 01:12:59.296
and I believe that
he would see me through this.

01:12:59.298 --> 01:13:01.032
And I would surprise you

01:13:01.034 --> 01:13:02.433
when I'm out of you

01:13:02.435 --> 01:13:03.900
to let you know that

01:13:03.902 --> 01:13:06.106
you just messed yourself up,
not me.

01:13:07.973 --> 01:13:09.241
I worry for you.

01:13:12.844 --> 01:13:13.946
Much luck.

01:13:25.258 --> 01:13:27.761
Alex, people judge you
by the friends you keep.

01:13:32.365 --> 01:13:36.000
Uh, it's "Replace male
friend who is a bad influence."

01:13:36.002 --> 01:13:37.868
You mean me?

01:13:37.870 --> 01:13:39.239
Uh, fuck her.

01:13:56.222 --> 01:13:57.954
Honey,

01:13:57.956 --> 01:14:00.123
you know I can't possibly
stay for this,

01:14:00.125 --> 01:14:01.395
but Gary will be right here.

01:14:06.164 --> 01:14:07.965
Look how beautiful it is.

01:14:07.967 --> 01:14:10.201
- Hmm.
- No smell, no...

01:14:10.203 --> 01:14:11.935
no residue of anything.

01:14:11.937 --> 01:14:13.203
Hmm.

01:14:13.205 --> 01:14:15.005
My mom went crazy.
She loved it.

01:14:15.007 --> 01:14:16.442
My dad was so impressed.

01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:29.052
I'll be right outside.

01:14:29.054 --> 01:14:30.089
Okay.

01:14:43.436 --> 01:14:45.138
I really need to talk to you.

01:14:47.005 --> 01:14:48.008
Can it wait?

01:14:50.209 --> 01:14:51.411
Of course.

01:14:53.445 --> 01:14:54.714
Word of advice.

01:14:55.947 --> 01:14:58.752
Stay soft.

01:15:00.119 --> 01:15:01.822
Okay, Gary.

01:15:11.396 --> 01:15:12.498
It's from the waist down.

01:15:14.133 --> 01:15:15.268
Oh.

01:15:23.543 --> 01:15:25.176
Ah, sit, sit, sit.

01:15:25.178 --> 01:15:26.847
- It's all right.
- Okay.

01:15:31.551 --> 01:15:33.951
Not to worry.

01:15:33.953 --> 01:15:37.086
I'm going to numb
the coronal skin

01:15:37.088 --> 01:15:38.792
around the head
of your penis.

01:15:40.258 --> 01:15:44.028
If you become erect,
it's perfectly normal.

01:15:44.030 --> 01:15:45.965
One prick and we're all done.

01:15:57.509 --> 01:15:59.913
Oh, uh... Hmm...

01:16:05.051 --> 01:16:06.319
My parents having sex.

01:16:09.454 --> 01:16:11.123
My grandparents are having sex.

01:16:13.292 --> 01:16:15.161
My parents are having sex
with my grandparents.

01:16:35.313 --> 01:16:36.512
Did it hurt?

01:16:36.514 --> 01:16:38.317
No, the mohel had, uh...

01:16:39.951 --> 01:16:41.120
good hands.

01:16:43.255 --> 01:16:44.257
Thank you.

01:16:46.124 --> 01:16:47.127
Thank you.

01:16:48.227 --> 01:16:49.296
Thank you.

01:16:50.463 --> 01:16:51.464
Thank you.

01:16:52.464 --> 01:16:53.465
Thank you.

01:16:54.467 --> 01:16:55.835
Gary passed out.

01:17:05.011 --> 01:17:06.012
Alex.

01:17:08.079 --> 01:17:09.114
It's too late.

01:17:10.115 --> 01:17:12.149
I'm a Jew.

01:17:12.151 --> 01:17:13.320
Not quite yet, Shlomo.

01:17:14.654 --> 01:17:17.186
Jesus! I have
to call you Shlomo?

01:17:17.188 --> 01:17:20.024
It's my new second middle name.

01:17:20.026 --> 01:17:22.128
I need a drink.

01:17:24.664 --> 01:17:27.197
Forget the cliche
of drinking with friends.

01:17:27.199 --> 01:17:29.201
Pairing wine with food
and all that crap.

01:17:30.201 --> 01:17:32.403
It's the sensual part of liquor.

01:17:32.405 --> 01:17:34.305
Like being kissed.

01:17:34.307 --> 01:17:37.174
That first sip rushes
to your thighs,

01:17:37.176 --> 01:17:38.574
the warm release of pleasure,

01:17:38.576 --> 01:17:40.614
and suddenly everything is okay.

01:17:42.181 --> 01:17:43.884
I wanna share that with you.

01:17:53.526 --> 01:17:55.295
The main purpose of alcohol...

01:17:56.728 --> 01:17:58.162
it's your lifeline.

01:17:58.164 --> 01:18:00.596
It will help you
through anything.

01:18:00.598 --> 01:18:04.404
Marriage, children,
work... women.

01:18:06.539 --> 01:18:09.305
Scotch is the most
important drink.

01:18:09.307 --> 01:18:12.042
If you're out with a coworker,
you order scotch. Neat.

01:18:12.044 --> 01:18:13.743
Doesn't matter what kind.

01:18:13.745 --> 01:18:16.046
If you're with a boss or client,

01:18:16.048 --> 01:18:18.482
you ask for a Macallan 12.

01:18:18.484 --> 01:18:19.552
Let me show you the difference.

01:18:31.364 --> 01:18:32.499
Oh.

01:18:35.034 --> 01:18:36.303
Now...

01:18:37.703 --> 01:18:39.438
the Macallan.

01:18:50.115 --> 01:18:51.083
Smooth.

01:18:52.618 --> 01:18:54.154
You have a good palate.

01:19:03.562 --> 01:19:04.664
Mmm.

01:19:06.432 --> 01:19:08.165
I do feel that in my thighs.

01:19:08.167 --> 01:19:09.169
She was right.

01:19:10.535 --> 01:19:13.470
That's a saketini, cosmopolitan,

01:19:13.472 --> 01:19:15.538
lemon drop, pomegranate martini.

01:19:15.540 --> 01:19:18.177
- Hmm.
- All these drinks are pretty...

01:19:20.111 --> 01:19:21.412
gay.

01:19:21.414 --> 01:19:22.715
But for some reason,
women love it.

01:19:28.721 --> 01:19:30.522
You know what my favorite part
of the day is?

01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:34.293
Picking Nicky up from school.

01:19:35.326 --> 01:19:37.226
There's this moment

01:19:37.228 --> 01:19:39.363
where he comes
out of the classroom,

01:19:39.365 --> 01:19:41.131
he runs over
and gives me that hug...

01:19:41.133 --> 01:19:42.402
Hey. Hey.

01:19:44.669 --> 01:19:46.205
It's my kid.

01:19:47.639 --> 01:19:50.509
You can't poach
another man's family, Alex.

01:19:52.645 --> 01:19:54.246
Go get your own.

01:19:57.249 --> 01:19:58.218
I am.

01:19:59.552 --> 01:20:01.321
I proposed to Katherine.

01:20:02.855 --> 01:20:04.854
Bullshit.

01:20:04.856 --> 01:20:07.426
I gave her a ring
with dog shit on it.

01:20:08.861 --> 01:20:10.196
Good job.

01:20:11.563 --> 01:20:13.566
Because you were starting
to piss me off.

01:20:15.101 --> 01:20:17.568
Every time I open the door,
there you are,

01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:20.369
on my couch, eating my food,

01:20:20.371 --> 01:20:22.741
showing Nicky how cool you are
with the boxing and the magic.

01:20:24.209 --> 01:20:26.275
But this is great.

01:20:26.277 --> 01:20:27.379
Yeah.

01:20:28.414 --> 01:20:29.749
Let's drink to Katherine.

01:20:33.451 --> 01:20:36.787
Thank you, God, for Katherine.

01:21:10.655 --> 01:21:11.690
So...

01:21:13.491 --> 01:21:15.225
you're Jewish,

01:21:15.227 --> 01:21:17.497
a drinker, and getting married.

01:21:19.898 --> 01:21:21.334
I guess so.

01:21:22.834 --> 01:21:24.868
Well, who's gonna be
your best man?

01:21:24.870 --> 01:21:26.473
Me?

01:21:29.642 --> 01:21:32.278
Uh, I don't know. I haven't
really thought about it.

01:21:33.411 --> 01:21:35.746
Well, you better start.

01:21:35.748 --> 01:21:38.118
Because now is when it starts
to get really fun.

01:21:39.218 --> 01:21:40.787
All the attention
is gonna be on you.

01:21:44.190 --> 01:21:45.822
I'm glad

01:21:45.824 --> 01:21:48.194
I was the inspiration
for Katherine's list.

01:21:51.362 --> 01:21:52.798
I love you.

01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:57.169
- It's gonna be okay.
- Yeah.

01:21:59.605 --> 01:22:00.970
Really fun.

01:22:00.972 --> 01:22:02.808
- Yeah.
- Just like you said.

01:22:04.709 --> 01:22:05.844
I promise.

01:22:08.746 --> 01:22:10.881
Hey, bud. You ready?

01:22:10.883 --> 01:22:12.381
Yeah.

01:22:12.383 --> 01:22:13.716
Be careful with my boy.

01:22:13.718 --> 01:22:14.786
Okay.

01:22:31.837 --> 01:22:35.538
It's like being in the cockpit
of your own fighter jet.

01:22:35.540 --> 01:22:37.674
It's sleek
and technically advanced

01:22:37.676 --> 01:22:40.711
with ultimate power
at your fingertips.

01:22:40.713 --> 01:22:43.846
Once you feel that torque,
you will never go back.

01:22:43.848 --> 01:22:45.881
You and Tucker deserve that.

01:22:45.883 --> 01:22:47.484
It's respect on the road.

01:22:47.486 --> 01:22:50.386
People will think twice
before messing with you.

01:22:50.388 --> 01:22:52.322
That's the real beauty.

01:23:10.409 --> 01:23:12.576
- Nicky, don't touch that.
- He can touch whatever he wants.

01:23:12.578 --> 01:23:14.877
Come on, grab the wheel.

01:23:14.879 --> 01:23:17.546
Grab it! Squeeze it!

01:23:17.548 --> 01:23:18.614
Yeah.

01:23:18.616 --> 01:23:20.751
That's the power.

01:23:20.753 --> 01:23:22.222
It's a game-changer, bruh.

01:23:23.621 --> 01:23:25.956
Why don't we take it
for a spin?

01:23:25.958 --> 01:23:27.326
Uh...

01:23:33.398 --> 01:23:34.965
I can't. I mean, I got the kid.

01:23:34.967 --> 01:23:36.366
You don't have to go fast.

01:23:36.368 --> 01:23:37.637
Let's go fast.

01:23:38.803 --> 01:23:40.272
Listen to your kid.

01:23:42.374 --> 01:23:44.006
He's not my kid.

01:23:44.008 --> 01:23:45.645
Oh. Why's he here?

01:23:47.679 --> 01:23:49.615
I wanted to get his opinion.

01:23:54.085 --> 01:23:55.618
And what do you think,
little man?

01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:57.453
Let's buy it.

01:23:57.455 --> 01:23:59.558
There you go. Let's make a deal.

01:24:25.116 --> 01:24:27.551
You-You know what?
I'm worried about your dog.

01:24:27.553 --> 01:24:29.485
- Uh... Enzo.
- What?

01:24:29.487 --> 01:24:31.354
He felt heavy,
uh, the other day.

01:24:31.356 --> 01:24:32.889
Like a half pound over.
Am I right?

01:24:32.891 --> 01:24:34.024
He's a little heavier.

01:24:34.026 --> 01:24:35.524
But I've been controlling
the portions

01:24:35.526 --> 01:24:36.792
just like you told me.

01:24:36.794 --> 01:24:38.761
I don't know.
Maybe you should show me

01:24:38.763 --> 01:24:40.497
what you're feeding him.

01:24:40.499 --> 01:24:42.431
I mean, if he is,
that could be really...

01:24:42.433 --> 01:24:43.703
Whoo!

01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:46.039
You know?

01:24:57.383 --> 01:24:58.715
CT scan
came up negative.

01:24:58.717 --> 01:24:59.852
He's lucky.

01:25:01.587 --> 01:25:02.818
My God.

01:25:02.820 --> 01:25:04.387
My God, honey, are you okay?

01:25:04.389 --> 01:25:06.756
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Is he gonna be okay?

01:25:06.758 --> 01:25:09.059
He's gonna be fine.
It's just a few bruises.

01:25:09.061 --> 01:25:11.627
Good thing it was a Porsche.

01:25:11.629 --> 01:25:13.365
It's like a tank.
I have two myself.

01:25:18.904 --> 01:25:20.005
Alex.

01:25:22.141 --> 01:25:23.643
It was an accident.

01:25:30.615 --> 01:25:32.582
It's my fault.

01:25:32.584 --> 01:25:34.050
Hey,

01:25:34.052 --> 01:25:35.185
we all make mistakes.

01:25:35.187 --> 01:25:36.856
So don't beat yourself up.

01:25:38.456 --> 01:25:39.622
Everything's okay.

01:25:39.624 --> 01:25:41.127
No, it's not okay.

01:25:55.907 --> 01:25:57.174
I don't know
what the hell I'm doing.

01:25:57.176 --> 01:25:58.977
I have no idea
what the hell I'm doing.

01:26:00.145 --> 01:26:03.212
My dependency on this family
is so unhealthy.

01:26:03.214 --> 01:26:04.547
And this list...

01:26:04.549 --> 01:26:06.485
Slow down. Take a seat.

01:26:12.557 --> 01:26:14.757
These are separate issues.

01:26:14.759 --> 01:26:16.091
First...

01:26:16.093 --> 01:26:17.163
Nicky is fine.

01:26:18.963 --> 01:26:20.997
Every family makes
a mistake like this.

01:26:20.999 --> 01:26:23.867
You looked away for one moment.

01:26:23.869 --> 01:26:26.936
You dependency on this family,
that is a problem.

01:26:26.938 --> 01:26:28.238
I need to back off.

01:26:28.240 --> 01:26:31.475
Yes, you do. But not just
for them, for you.

01:26:31.477 --> 01:26:33.076
You're hanging on to them
for dear life.

01:26:33.078 --> 01:26:34.911
You're like a swimmer
who's drowning.

01:26:34.913 --> 01:26:36.782
Don't drown them.
Don't drown yourself.

01:26:39.116 --> 01:26:40.753
And the list...

01:26:42.855 --> 01:26:45.921
Take time to explore
what you have with Katherine.

01:26:45.923 --> 01:26:48.225
It's silly, but use
the list as a catalyst

01:26:48.227 --> 01:26:51.130
to move your relationship
to the next level.

01:26:59.804 --> 01:27:02.238
How did you find
your bashert?

01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:03.672
Ah, you've been studying, hmm?

01:27:03.674 --> 01:27:04.709
Bashert.

01:27:07.545 --> 01:27:09.115
Well...

01:27:11.215 --> 01:27:12.651
With my Miriam...

01:27:14.652 --> 01:27:17.052
it started out hot and heavy.

01:27:17.054 --> 01:27:19.525
And after a while,
I started to become bored.

01:27:21.259 --> 01:27:23.762
And then one night,
we really...

01:27:24.795 --> 01:27:26.499
started to talk.

01:27:28.734 --> 01:27:32.234
I learned that she had
a great family.

01:27:32.236 --> 01:27:34.637
We realized that we had
similar morals,

01:27:34.639 --> 01:27:36.640
which made it easy
for us to get along

01:27:36.642 --> 01:27:37.844
and to have fun.

01:27:38.944 --> 01:27:40.810
She didn't hold back,

01:27:40.812 --> 01:27:42.615
and I didn't hold back.

01:27:47.285 --> 01:27:50.155
And for the first time
in my life, Alex, I-I felt...

01:27:52.257 --> 01:27:55.561
completely able to be myself.

01:27:56.762 --> 01:27:58.030
I felt freer.

01:28:00.264 --> 01:28:03.235
I felt freer with her than I
ever had as a single man.

01:28:05.803 --> 01:28:08.173
We have
an authentic relationship.

01:28:10.208 --> 01:28:12.578
And this is what you should have
with Katherine.

01:28:14.279 --> 01:28:17.881
This is the foundation that
we built our relationship on.

01:28:17.883 --> 01:28:20.116
But you have to do this
without family interference,

01:28:20.118 --> 01:28:21.888
without all the bells
and whistles.

01:28:23.722 --> 01:28:25.157
Friends, money...

01:28:27.793 --> 01:28:29.094
This is what I wish for you.

01:28:30.861 --> 01:28:31.897
Hmm.

01:28:32.931 --> 01:28:34.200
Don't settle for anything less.

01:29:08.400 --> 01:29:11.804
Whoo!

01:29:15.339 --> 01:29:17.944
Whoo!

01:29:30.321 --> 01:29:31.757
Whoo?

01:29:35.326 --> 01:29:36.695
Whoo!

01:29:42.868 --> 01:29:45.638
Whoo-woop!

01:29:49.040 --> 01:29:51.776
Whoo-woop!

01:30:08.325 --> 01:30:11.060
Lead me in the path
of righteousness.

01:30:11.062 --> 01:30:14.363
Help me use my abilities
to repair this broken world.

01:30:14.365 --> 01:30:17.033
Help me ease and gladden

01:30:17.035 --> 01:30:18.971
the lives of those I cherish.

01:30:33.185 --> 01:30:34.783
This is your mikveh.

01:30:34.785 --> 01:30:36.019
Regardless of what happens,

01:30:36.021 --> 01:30:38.424
it will always be
a source of comfort.

01:30:40.959 --> 01:30:42.261
This is for you.

01:30:50.835 --> 01:30:52.370
That took chutzpah.

01:31:03.414 --> 01:31:05.850
Hey, you all right?

01:31:08.219 --> 01:31:10.789
You shouldn't have to take shots
for the rest of your life.

01:31:15.893 --> 01:31:17.163
I gave Tucker away.

01:31:18.329 --> 01:31:19.364
Alex.

01:31:20.965 --> 01:31:22.468
I'm so sorry.

01:31:27.138 --> 01:31:29.441
It's... probably
the right thing to do.

01:31:39.151 --> 01:31:41.053
I can't get Gary
out of the pool.

01:32:03.275 --> 01:32:04.744
Hey, man.

01:32:05.843 --> 01:32:06.978
You doing okay?

01:32:08.413 --> 01:32:09.482
I don't know.

01:32:13.884 --> 01:32:15.120
Is it Rhonda?

01:32:17.388 --> 01:32:18.523
Yes.

01:32:21.058 --> 01:32:21.959
Cold feet?

01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:27.365
This is more than cold feet.

01:32:28.933 --> 01:32:30.168
I'm not attracted to her.

01:32:31.535 --> 01:32:33.271
I don't like the way she smells.

01:32:35.206 --> 01:32:36.374
Rhonda's garlicky.

01:32:37.875 --> 01:32:39.408
It's reciprocal.

01:32:39.410 --> 01:32:41.079
My last girlfriend was musty.

01:32:43.181 --> 01:32:45.451
You'll, um...
You'll get used to it.

01:32:47.384 --> 01:32:49.187
She's not into
the way I smell either.

01:32:50.422 --> 01:32:52.255
And the way
she drinks her coffee?

01:32:59.030 --> 01:33:00.965
You're focusing
on the wrong stuff, man.

01:33:02.433 --> 01:33:04.266
That's nothing, right?

01:33:04.268 --> 01:33:07.205
You guys laugh together?
Is the sex good?

01:33:10.609 --> 01:33:11.877
Great sex.

01:33:12.977 --> 01:33:14.243
And we laugh.

01:33:14.245 --> 01:33:15.380
Good.

01:33:17.249 --> 01:33:19.585
But we don't laugh
at the same things.

01:33:22.053 --> 01:33:23.989
She laughs
while we're having sex.

01:33:26.423 --> 01:33:28.026
It's weird.

01:33:31.529 --> 01:33:33.464
Well, Rhonda can't change
her smell, Gary.

01:34:03.695 --> 01:34:04.864
Hey.

01:34:06.463 --> 01:34:08.197
Hey. Hey.

01:34:24.148 --> 01:34:27.419
I just can't stand watching
how sad you've been.

01:34:28.652 --> 01:34:31.056
This is in no way
meant to replace Tucker.

01:34:43.234 --> 01:34:44.570
I'm not allergic to cats.

01:34:47.739 --> 01:34:49.572
It's...

01:34:49.574 --> 01:34:50.640
It's cute.

01:34:53.745 --> 01:34:55.744
You okay?

01:34:55.746 --> 01:34:56.915
I'm okay.

01:34:58.450 --> 01:35:00.216
Gary's wedding will be
a good diversion.

01:35:00.218 --> 01:35:01.751
We should make it fun.

01:35:37.121 --> 01:35:38.958
I got the cat to sit
with me for a few minutes.

01:35:39.758 --> 01:35:41.556
You're bonding.

01:35:41.558 --> 01:35:42.658
No way.

01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:44.760
That's great.

01:35:44.762 --> 01:35:46.998
Oh, my God. It's that lunatic.

01:35:48.133 --> 01:35:50.533
It's okay. I am not attack.

01:35:50.535 --> 01:35:53.105
Dave is needing
to be sorry to you.

01:35:54.705 --> 01:35:56.805
To him, it hard talk

01:35:56.807 --> 01:35:59.375
emotional shit in your face.

01:35:59.377 --> 01:36:00.611
Just keep her away from me.

01:36:01.612 --> 01:36:03.449
Sorry I had sex with Anastasiya.

01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:08.253
And, Katherine,
you are not a bitch.

01:36:10.588 --> 01:36:11.590
Ha!

01:36:20.632 --> 01:36:22.067
Wow!

01:36:23.601 --> 01:36:24.603
Dave...

01:36:26.570 --> 01:36:27.605
Oh.

01:36:29.706 --> 01:36:31.440
Oh...

01:36:31.442 --> 01:36:32.444
Thank you.

01:36:33.445 --> 01:36:34.612
- You should try them on.
- Okay.

01:36:37.382 --> 01:36:40.248
I am sorry I jump your body.

01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:41.520
Oh, don't worry about it.

01:36:42.587 --> 01:36:43.589
We okay?

01:36:44.655 --> 01:36:45.757
Hey, yeah.

01:36:50.128 --> 01:36:51.760
As you share
this one cup of wine,

01:36:51.762 --> 01:36:54.332
you undertake all
the future brings.

01:36:56.234 --> 01:36:59.202
All the sweetness life brings
will be that much sweeter

01:36:59.204 --> 01:37:01.040
because you drink
from it together.

01:37:41.346 --> 01:37:42.711
Stop.

01:37:46.884 --> 01:37:48.150
I'm sorry, Rabbi.

01:37:48.152 --> 01:37:49.784
I don't mean any disrespect.

01:37:49.786 --> 01:37:51.222
Alex.

01:37:54.225 --> 01:37:55.194
As a new Jew...

01:37:57.161 --> 01:37:59.862
I can't in good conscience
watch Gary break that glass

01:37:59.864 --> 01:38:01.866
after the feelings he shared
with me in the deep end of...

01:38:03.234 --> 01:38:04.667
Mr. Stern's pool the other day.

01:38:08.173 --> 01:38:10.805
Feelings that indicate
this wedding shouldn't happen.

01:38:10.807 --> 01:38:12.210
What are you doing?

01:38:13.477 --> 01:38:14.645
Um...

01:38:16.446 --> 01:38:17.548
Uh...

01:38:28.959 --> 01:38:31.894
A very wise person told me

01:38:31.896 --> 01:38:33.764
that you must live
an authentic life.

01:38:35.232 --> 01:38:36.400
I believe if we...

01:38:38.503 --> 01:38:41.540
let this wedding go forward,
it will be a lie.

01:38:45.276 --> 01:38:47.146
Gary, is this true?

01:38:49.414 --> 01:38:50.449
It is true.

01:38:52.717 --> 01:38:54.186
And I'm sorry, Gary...

01:38:55.852 --> 01:38:57.619
but I'm in love
with someone else.

01:39:02.526 --> 01:39:04.961
Oh, my God.
That makes so much sense.

01:39:07.999 --> 01:39:09.966
Settle down, everybody.

01:39:09.968 --> 01:39:11.236
Settle down.

01:39:12.402 --> 01:39:14.470
Alex...

01:39:14.472 --> 01:39:15.871
normally,

01:39:15.873 --> 01:39:18.608
I would kill you
for pulling a stunt like that.

01:39:18.610 --> 01:39:20.976
But in this case...

01:39:20.978 --> 01:39:22.411
it was the right thing to do.

01:39:23.681 --> 01:39:24.750
Now, look...

01:39:26.618 --> 01:39:29.788
we came here to enjoy
a beautiful ceremony.

01:39:31.588 --> 01:39:33.723
Celebrate the joining
of two lives.

01:39:33.725 --> 01:39:35.393
And I'm paying for it.

01:39:36.628 --> 01:39:37.663
So...

01:39:38.730 --> 01:39:40.331
somebody here
is getting married.

01:39:41.665 --> 01:39:42.668
You two.

01:39:44.901 --> 01:39:46.735
Wait.

01:39:46.737 --> 01:39:50.273
Antonio, you're a good man.

01:39:50.275 --> 01:39:52.608
It's not gonna happen
with my daughter.

01:39:52.610 --> 01:39:53.612
Go get a drink.

01:39:54.879 --> 01:39:56.378
Alex, Katherine,

01:39:56.380 --> 01:39:57.912
you two love each other.

01:39:57.914 --> 01:40:00.451
Now, let's get on with it.

01:40:09.494 --> 01:40:10.462
Umm...

01:40:11.462 --> 01:40:13.628
give me just... one moment.

01:40:13.630 --> 01:40:15.433
- Yeah.
- Okay?

01:40:17.401 --> 01:40:18.567
One moment.

01:40:23.807 --> 01:40:25.841
As you share this cup of wine,

01:40:25.843 --> 01:40:28.347
you undertake all that
the future may bring.

01:40:29.847 --> 01:40:32.014
All the sweetness
that life brings

01:40:32.016 --> 01:40:33.948
will be even sweeter

01:40:33.950 --> 01:40:35.721
because you drink
from it together.

01:42:05.709 --> 01:42:07.712
Alex, break the glass.

01:42:09.079 --> 01:42:10.114
What are you doing?

01:42:11.581 --> 01:42:12.616
I didn't buy the Porsche.

01:42:15.585 --> 01:42:16.821
What are you talking about?

01:42:18.588 --> 01:42:19.590
It's the cat.

01:42:20.958 --> 01:42:22.558
What?

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:23.695
The kitten.

01:42:24.695 --> 01:42:25.764
It made me see.

01:42:30.868 --> 01:42:32.036
Look...

01:42:33.538 --> 01:42:36.441
even if I got a 100 percent
on this list,

01:42:37.441 --> 01:42:38.609
it still wouldn't matter.

01:42:40.678 --> 01:42:42.414
And there's some
great things on there.

01:42:44.882 --> 01:42:46.982
There are, but...

01:42:46.984 --> 01:42:48.085
in the end, I'm...

01:42:51.588 --> 01:42:53.057
I'm just not a cat guy.

01:42:54.124 --> 01:42:56.127
You'll learn to like cats.

01:42:57.661 --> 01:43:00.496
I just... I just wanted
to lift you up to this

01:43:00.498 --> 01:43:01.963
great life.

01:43:01.965 --> 01:43:04.132
I know, I don't want
to be lifted into another life.

01:43:04.134 --> 01:43:07.036
Katherine, you see, you...

01:43:07.038 --> 01:43:09.738
you've put together
this imagined person

01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:11.877
that just doesn't exist
inside of me.

01:43:13.143 --> 01:43:14.909
This isn't happening.

01:43:14.911 --> 01:43:16.414
This isn't happening.

01:43:24.856 --> 01:43:26.892
This is the list
you should give your bashert.

01:43:42.005 --> 01:43:43.074
Lily...

01:43:45.877 --> 01:43:47.012
what are you doing here?

01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:50.882
You called her, didn't you?

01:43:52.048 --> 01:43:53.282
Yeah.

01:43:53.284 --> 01:43:55.551
She's my best friend.

01:43:55.553 --> 01:43:58.953
If I was getting married today,
I wanted her to be here.

01:43:58.955 --> 01:44:01.256
You just really can't make
a decision without her, can you?

01:44:01.258 --> 01:44:03.024
You-You couldn't even decide

01:44:03.026 --> 01:44:04.726
to marry me without asking her.

01:44:04.728 --> 01:44:07.162
Katherine,
I just told her to come.

01:44:07.164 --> 01:44:08.867
I didn't tell her
we were getting married.

01:44:12.270 --> 01:44:13.938
You know, I almost put you
on the list.

01:44:15.138 --> 01:44:16.173
You almost put...

01:44:21.579 --> 01:44:22.647
I'm sorry.

01:44:36.227 --> 01:44:37.061
Katherine...

01:44:40.231 --> 01:44:42.200
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

01:45:00.884 --> 01:45:02.885
I have something
I need to do.

01:45:02.887 --> 01:45:04.155
I'm gonna go with you.

01:45:38.923 --> 01:45:40.189
- Alex, hey.
- Hey, hey.

01:45:40.191 --> 01:45:41.790
- Hey.
- You're coming for a visit?

01:45:41.792 --> 01:45:43.058
We were just gonna go
for a walk.

01:45:43.060 --> 01:45:44.659
No, I didn't come for a visit.

01:45:44.661 --> 01:45:47.363
I came to tell you guys
I made a huge, huge mistake.

01:45:47.365 --> 01:45:49.030
Tucker's my dog.

01:45:49.032 --> 01:45:51.766
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, no.
- Oh, no, no, he's our dog now.

01:45:51.768 --> 01:45:53.268
It hasn't been 48 hours.

01:45:53.270 --> 01:45:55.738
You don't have any written or
witness to a verbal agreement.

01:45:55.740 --> 01:45:57.305
Legally, you have no standing.

01:45:57.307 --> 01:45:58.907
Who is this?

01:45:58.909 --> 01:46:00.011
I'm Alex's attorney.

01:46:01.846 --> 01:46:03.949
So don't fuck with me.

01:46:08.953 --> 01:46:10.885
Alex? Alex?

01:46:10.887 --> 01:46:12.356
Shut up!

01:46:13.790 --> 01:46:15.424
I know, I know.
Guys, I'm sorry.

01:46:15.426 --> 01:46:17.792
I'm so sorry. Look, I'll get you
guys any other dog you want.

01:46:17.794 --> 01:46:19.795
Any kind. I promise.

01:46:19.797 --> 01:46:21.363
How about a labradoodle.
She wants a labradoodle.

01:46:21.365 --> 01:46:22.398
Yeah.

01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:23.368
Done!

01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:31.305
Open the door. Open the door!

01:46:34.911 --> 01:46:37.445
Look, you didn't get the girl,
but you got your dog back.

01:46:37.447 --> 01:46:39.848
And you are now
a well-read, well-dressed,

01:46:39.850 --> 01:46:42.083
handsome Jewish man
with sparkling white teeth

01:46:42.085 --> 01:46:44.752
who likes football
and knows good scotch.

01:46:44.754 --> 01:46:45.757
Huh?

01:46:47.391 --> 01:46:48.627
Get in the back.

01:48:04.334 --> 01:48:06.837
Whoo!

01:48:09.373 --> 01:48:11.776
Whoo!

01:48:19.917 --> 01:48:20.948
Hey.

01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:22.721
- Hi.
