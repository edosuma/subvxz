<i>Happy Jack wasn't old
But he was a man</i>

00:21.398 --> 00:25.276
<i>He lived in the sand
At the Isle of Man</i>

00:29.155 --> 00:33.326
<i>The kids would all sing
He would take the wrong key</i>

00:34.744 --> 00:39.165
<i>So they rode on his head
In their furry donkey</i>

00:46.464 --> 00:49.759
<i>The kids couldn't hurt Jack
They tried, tried, tried</i>

00:49.926 --> 00:53.763
<i>They dropped things on his back
They lied, lied, lied, lied, lied</i>

00:53.930 --> 00:55.932
Way to go, son!

00:56.391 --> 00:57.392
No!

00:57.559 --> 01:00.145
<i>But they couldn't stop Jack
Or the waters lapping</i>

01:02.856 --> 01:06.317
<i>And they couldn't prevent
Jack from feeling happy</i>

01:19.247 --> 01:21.750
<i>But they couldn't stop Jack
Or the waters lapping</i>

01:21.916 --> 01:24.586
Come on. Let's go.

01:25.336 --> 01:29.299
<i>And they couldn't prevent
Jack from feeling happy</i>

01:29.466 --> 01:30.884
<i>This is pointless.</i>

01:33.052 --> 01:35.972
<i>He knows that he is a bad boy.</i>

01:37.348 --> 01:38.558
<i>Why don't you listen?</i>

01:38.725 --> 01:39.976
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

01:40.143 --> 01:43.146
<i>- You are stupid. You're an idiot.
- Stupid, stupid, stupid.</i>

01:43.354 --> 01:45.023
Nobody cares about you.

01:45.190 --> 01:47.484
<i>Hey, you'd lose your head
if it wasn't attached.</i>

01:47.650 --> 01:51.196
<i>- Lose your damn head.
- Stupid.</i>

01:54.199 --> 01:57.076
<i>Nobody cares about you.</i>

01:57.243 --> 02:01.331
<i>- Nobody cares about you.
- You must take one pill twice a day.</i>

02:01.498 --> 02:03.792
<i>All right? All right?</i>

02:03.958 --> 02:05.710
<i>All right, David?</i>

02:05.877 --> 02:09.047
<i>And they couldn't prevent
Jack from feeling happy</i>

02:26.481 --> 02:28.775
<i>- What are you doing?
- Loser.</i>

02:43.164 --> 02:47.126
<i>Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you</i>

02:47.293 --> 02:52.423
<i>Happy birthday, dear David
Happy birthday to you</i>

02:55.093 --> 02:56.678
Ma'am?

02:56.845 --> 02:58.930
- What?
- There's some--

02:59.097 --> 03:01.224
You-- You can't give me that.

03:01.391 --> 03:02.767
Oh.

03:03.017 --> 03:04.435
Oops.

03:09.274 --> 03:14.779
So do they let you throw
a little party here, or...?

03:14.946 --> 03:17.490
Yeah, they clear out the furniture,
we get a DJ.

03:17.657 --> 03:20.743
- Really?
- No. We do get better drugs, though.

03:20.910 --> 03:23.162
- Really?
- No.

03:23.329 --> 03:26.791
It's just Thursday.

03:27.542 --> 03:30.253
My 260th Thursday...

03:30.420 --> 03:35.049
...as a passenger on the cruise ship
<i>Mental Health.</i>

03:36.384 --> 03:39.971
On the plus side, I have mastered
the art of eating with a spoon, so....

03:41.055 --> 03:43.224
You're getting better, though.

03:43.391 --> 03:45.727
The voices.

03:45.894 --> 03:49.105
You're not seeing things that aren't there.

03:56.571 --> 03:57.822
When can I come home?

03:57.989 --> 03:59.741
Oh, that's....

04:00.116 --> 04:02.577
What does your doctor say?

04:03.286 --> 04:05.788
I tell them I'm sane. They think I'm crazy.

04:05.955 --> 04:08.541
If I say, "You know what?
You're right. I am crazy."...

04:08.708 --> 04:11.628
...then they up my dosage, so....

04:11.794 --> 04:13.338
Oh.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.048
How about I talk to them, hmm?

04:16.215 --> 04:18.259
I'll tell them...

04:20.678 --> 04:22.764
...you seem better to me.

04:24.682 --> 04:25.850
How is it?

04:27.769 --> 04:29.228
Sorry.

04:30.939 --> 04:32.440
Time for your meds.

04:40.448 --> 04:43.409
Something new needs to happen soon.

05:32.625 --> 05:34.627
It's just spit, right?

05:34.794 --> 05:36.295
Human spit.

05:39.298 --> 05:41.259
Maybe he ate yogurt.

05:41.426 --> 05:43.511
Like a creamy....

05:43.678 --> 05:47.390
What's he on, you think? Klonopin?

05:48.224 --> 05:51.060
Yeah. Klonopin will....

05:51.477 --> 05:56.024
Or hold the phone. Yogurt and Klonopin.

05:56.649 --> 05:58.693
That'll....

05:59.444 --> 06:02.196
A cocktail.

06:07.660 --> 06:11.372
Or hold the phone,
who's that? Who's that?

06:13.291 --> 06:16.210
Ooh. A dark-horse candidate.

06:16.794 --> 06:19.589
Late entry to the race.

06:35.938 --> 06:37.899
Ooh. Good hair.

06:38.066 --> 06:40.276
Nice hindquarters.

06:42.028 --> 06:44.614
- Watch it.
- A little jittery...

06:44.781 --> 06:48.576
...but I gotta say, folks, here at CNN,
we like her chances.

06:49.243 --> 06:50.787
Give me your Twizzlers.

06:50.953 --> 06:53.039
Okay. Now, let's not--

06:55.333 --> 06:56.959
That's just low, son.

06:57.418 --> 06:59.170
Barrett, three pills.

07:05.968 --> 07:07.386
- Oh, shit.
- You're too close.

07:07.553 --> 07:09.388
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Too close.

07:09.555 --> 07:10.890
- Too close.
- I'm sorry.

07:11.057 --> 07:14.811
I'm sorry. I just-- You know,
just wondered if you wanted a...

07:15.603 --> 07:17.146
...Twizzler.

07:18.481 --> 07:21.651
<i>And how does that make you feel?</i>

07:26.781 --> 07:28.366
<i>And how does that make you feel?</i>

07:28.616 --> 07:31.160
<i>The drugs help. The Haldol.</i>

07:32.995 --> 07:35.081
Barrett? Three pills.

07:35.248 --> 07:36.916
<i>How does that make you feel?</i>

07:39.168 --> 07:41.087
Could you put the cup on the counter?

07:41.462 --> 07:42.588
<i>Why?</i>

07:43.131 --> 07:45.174
Oh, shit.

07:48.719 --> 07:50.388
<i>How do you feel?</i>

07:53.516 --> 07:56.936
<i>The devil with yellow eyes.</i>

08:01.190 --> 08:03.192
<i>Is he here now?</i>

08:33.639 --> 08:36.100
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm calm.

08:36.267 --> 08:39.854
I just had a bad dream.
And, guys, violence is not necessary.

08:40.021 --> 08:42.148
Needles are not necessary.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.320
<i>David?</i>

08:56.204 --> 08:58.456
How does that make you feel?

09:00.082 --> 09:02.084
I mean, it's just....

09:02.335 --> 09:03.920
It's fine.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.713
Like, whatever.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.341
Because, I mean, look at me.
I know what I am.

09:08.507 --> 09:11.135
- And what's that?
- Well, you know.

09:14.180 --> 09:16.724
What happened. What I did...

09:18.017 --> 09:19.560
...to Dr. Poole.

09:20.186 --> 09:23.231
- You went off your medications.
- But that's not....

09:29.904 --> 09:31.197
That's....

09:32.031 --> 09:33.699
You know, I....

09:34.033 --> 09:35.076
I saw things.

09:35.243 --> 09:37.370
Delusions, you mean.
We talked about that.

09:37.536 --> 09:39.413
Your brain chemistry...

09:39.580 --> 09:42.375
- Hey, yeah.
- ...your illness simulates voices.

09:42.541 --> 09:45.962
All the hallucinations you described...

09:46.128 --> 09:48.714
- ...the devil with yellow eyes.
- Hmm.

09:50.258 --> 09:52.426
You have something to add?

09:53.135 --> 09:54.804
No.

09:56.180 --> 09:57.807
Please keep talking.

09:57.974 --> 10:01.811
So we can all pretend that our problems
are just in our heads.

10:03.479 --> 10:05.398
What does that mean?

10:09.652 --> 10:13.698
It means that you're in here
because somebody said you're not normal.

10:14.031 --> 10:17.368
Like normal is this suit
we're all supposed to....

10:18.327 --> 10:20.621
But you know who else wasn't normal?
Picasso.

10:20.788 --> 10:23.749
- Einstein.
- Ooh, I like her.

10:23.916 --> 10:25.793
I like you.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.754
You got what the kids these days
call moxie.

10:29.130 --> 10:33.092
You know, just so I'm clear, are you
Einstein or Picasso in this scenario?

10:33.259 --> 10:35.136
Whatever.

10:35.303 --> 10:37.638
All I'm saying is...

10:38.597 --> 10:41.225
...what if your problems
aren't in your head?

10:42.601 --> 10:45.104
What if they aren't even problems?

10:46.731 --> 10:49.608
- Talk about that.
- No, I'm good.

10:50.651 --> 10:54.155
I read in your file
that you don't like to be touched.

10:58.326 --> 11:02.705
All animals need physical contact
to feel love.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.920
You know those cartoons
in, like, magazines?

11:10.087 --> 11:12.590
There's a man on an island with,
like, maybe a single palm tree.

11:12.757 --> 11:13.758
Hmm.

11:13.924 --> 11:17.595
People say go to your happy place,
and that's what I think about.

11:18.846 --> 11:20.931
- Well, that's sad.
- That's sad?

11:23.392 --> 11:25.853
You're in a mental hospital.

11:27.438 --> 11:29.148
All I'm saying is...

11:30.816 --> 11:34.111
...that thing they tell us is crazy.

11:34.945 --> 11:39.492
How I don't wanna be handled.

11:40.576 --> 11:44.997
Or you see stuff
and hear whatever voices.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.126
That's what makes you you.

11:59.678 --> 12:02.098
Do you wanna be my girlfriend?

12:08.938 --> 12:10.523
Okay.

12:11.774 --> 12:14.485
But don't touch me.

12:15.569 --> 12:16.946
Okay.

12:22.326 --> 12:23.953
Yeah?

12:24.495 --> 12:26.163
Yeah.

12:27.498 --> 12:29.166
Okay.

12:32.545 --> 12:34.547
Find me at dinner.

12:43.514 --> 12:45.683
Why are the hot ones always so crazy?

12:53.482 --> 12:56.819
<i>She comes in colors everywhere</i>

12:56.986 --> 13:02.825
<i>She combs her hair
She's like a rainbow</i>

13:02.992 --> 13:05.911
<i>Coming, colors in the air</i>

13:06.078 --> 13:10.583
<i>Oh, everywhere
She comes in colors</i>

13:19.258 --> 13:22.511
- No cherries.
- I live on cherry pie. It's incredible.

13:22.678 --> 13:26.807
I don't like orange-flavored things,
and I don't like cherry-flavored things.

13:26.974 --> 13:31.562
This has pretty much everything you need.
It has, like, crust and cherries.

13:35.024 --> 13:38.402
<i>She comes in colors everywhere</i>

13:38.569 --> 13:40.362
<i>She combs her hair</i>

13:40.529 --> 13:44.158
<i>She's like a rainbow</i>

13:44.325 --> 13:46.619
<i>Coming, colors in the air</i>

13:47.119 --> 13:53.042
<i>Oh, everywhere
She comes in colors</i>

14:38.712 --> 14:40.923
I see you.

14:43.092 --> 14:45.261
This is your spot, huh?

14:49.765 --> 14:52.560
After the sun goes down...

14:54.186 --> 14:56.564
...when the light is right...

14:57.356 --> 14:59.191
...if you...

15:01.318 --> 15:04.530
...kind of un-focus your eyes...

15:06.532 --> 15:07.950
...like this. See?

15:10.286 --> 15:12.580
- That's charming.
- Shut up.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.292
Now you.

15:20.421 --> 15:22.715
And then look back out.

15:31.640 --> 15:34.560
You see how the hospital disappears?

15:36.312 --> 15:38.814
You can see yourself down there.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.319
Like...

15:43.694 --> 15:45.779
...you're in here...

15:47.197 --> 15:49.950
...watching yourself outside.

15:52.453 --> 15:53.579
What are you doing?

15:53.746 --> 15:56.498
Keep calm. I'm not gonna touch you.

15:56.957 --> 16:01.003
Just hold still and look out the window.

16:22.066 --> 16:24.068
<i>David.</i>

16:24.485 --> 16:28.197
How long were you together?
You and the girl who disappeared?

16:28.364 --> 16:29.740
She didn't disappear.

16:30.324 --> 16:32.785
I told you, they took her.

16:32.951 --> 16:34.453
Sydney Barrett, the girl?

16:35.204 --> 16:38.874
Yes. Look, uh, talk to the hospital.
They've got records.

16:39.041 --> 16:41.877
The hospital where you were a patient
the past six years...

16:42.044 --> 16:45.673
...after being diagnosed
with paranoid schizophrenia?

16:45.839 --> 16:49.176
Yes, but my condition
has nothing to do with that.

16:49.343 --> 16:52.846
I didn't make her up. She's a real girl.
A woman.

16:55.265 --> 16:58.686
- Call the hospital. They've got records.
- We've spoken to the hospital.

16:58.852 --> 17:02.481
They have no record of Sydney Barrett
ever being a patient there.

17:06.694 --> 17:12.116
Look, is it possible, Mr. Haller--?
And I'm not a psychiatrist, so....

17:12.282 --> 17:16.662
But is it possible that this whole thing,
the girl, the incident...

17:16.829 --> 17:18.789
...that it's just part of your illness?

17:18.956 --> 17:20.999
- A delusion?
- Uh, yes.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.501
Sure, uh, fine.

17:22.668 --> 17:24.169
Um....

17:24.336 --> 17:28.340
Well, how do you explain
what happened to Lenny?

17:28.841 --> 17:30.175
Well, all of them.

17:30.342 --> 17:33.053
Well, I can't.
That's why we're having this.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.514
Talk to Dr. Kissinger. He knows.

17:36.640 --> 17:39.268
And Dr. Kissinger was your psychiatrist?

17:39.435 --> 17:40.853
Yes.

17:41.019 --> 17:44.398
Ahem, somehow, I have a hard time
believing your psychiatrist...

17:44.565 --> 17:47.234
...is gonna confirm the story
that you're telling me now.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.488
Well, David, I think, don't you,
that we should talk about it?

17:51.655 --> 17:53.574
Hmm? No.

17:53.741 --> 17:57.453
It's important you-- If you wanna go home--
You see, my job--

17:57.619 --> 17:58.746
Part of my job...

17:59.747 --> 18:01.540
...is to assess.

18:01.707 --> 18:04.293
Are you still a danger to yourself?
To others?

18:04.460 --> 18:07.087
And the fact that you tried
to hang yourself.

18:07.254 --> 18:09.840
- We can skip that part.
- Hmm?

18:10.883 --> 18:13.010
Unless you think it's relevant too.

18:13.177 --> 18:15.596
No. We don't have to.

18:22.686 --> 18:24.980
Interesting. Okay.

18:25.147 --> 18:26.523
Let's talk about it.

18:29.318 --> 18:32.654
Uh, well, I, uh, had a hard time after college...

18:32.821 --> 18:36.450
...after I got expelled.

18:36.700 --> 18:38.368
I wasn't thinking straight.

18:40.078 --> 18:43.999
<i>The voices and, uh, not sleeping.</i>

18:45.417 --> 18:47.669
<i>And I was angry all the....</i>

18:48.670 --> 18:51.507
<i>- And then Philly left.</i>
- David, you okay?

18:54.718 --> 18:57.805
And I decided, you know...

18:57.971 --> 18:59.890
...what was the point?

19:00.766 --> 19:03.936
When a blade breaks, you don't fix it.
You just get another blade.

19:04.102 --> 19:06.980
So I tied a knot.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.399
<i>- David, stop. Stop.
- Don't touch it.</i>

19:09.566 --> 19:11.318
<i>- Don't.
- Stupid, stupid.</i>

19:11.735 --> 19:13.570
Did the voices tell you to do that?

19:13.737 --> 19:16.031
No. No.

19:16.198 --> 19:18.534
No, they tried to stop me.

19:18.700 --> 19:20.452
They didn't like it.

19:20.786 --> 19:23.956
<i>And yet the police say
they found no noose in the apartment.</i>

19:25.040 --> 19:26.667
<i>Just rope burns on your neck.</i>

19:33.674 --> 19:35.342
How do you feel now?

19:37.094 --> 19:38.637
Uh....

19:38.804 --> 19:40.764
Better.

19:41.098 --> 19:42.683
Well, let me ask you this.

19:42.850 --> 19:46.854
Do you still feel that, quote:

19:47.354 --> 19:51.233
"You have power over things
and can control things with your mind"?

19:53.694 --> 19:54.736
<i>Hold on.</i>

19:55.404 --> 19:58.073
You think you can control things
with your mind?

19:58.240 --> 20:00.075
I did at one point.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.994
But they help with that, the drugs.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.913
- Is that why I'm here? Is that what this is?
- David.

20:05.080 --> 20:08.083
You think I did this?
That I killed her with my mind?

20:08.250 --> 20:11.545
No. Don't be ridiculous, but....

20:12.254 --> 20:14.464
The girl is dead, David. She is.

20:14.631 --> 20:17.342
And it wasn't a heart attack, right?

20:17.509 --> 20:20.012
So we're just...

20:20.262 --> 20:23.181
...uh, looking for the truth...

20:24.224 --> 20:25.726
...which you promised to tell.

20:27.603 --> 20:29.187
Look.

20:29.354 --> 20:30.939
I don't know, okay?

20:31.106 --> 20:35.152
It's-- It's fuzzy. It's....

20:35.736 --> 20:37.654
That's okay.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.657
Just tell me what happened next.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.493
Boo.

21:26.787 --> 21:28.580
Jeez.

21:28.914 --> 21:30.290
- What are you doing?
- Shh.

21:31.917 --> 21:34.044
- Can you be in here?
- Don't be a pussy.

21:34.544 --> 21:36.421
Lie back.

21:43.220 --> 21:44.429
No, I'll be on top.

21:44.888 --> 21:46.473
All right.

21:46.640 --> 21:48.100
Yeah.

22:08.286 --> 22:10.831
I'm getting out tomorrow.

22:15.085 --> 22:16.628
What?

22:18.630 --> 22:21.133
Kissinger says I'm clean.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.636
So I get to go home.

22:36.231 --> 22:38.358
Good. That's good.

22:53.040 --> 22:55.333
You've got to get better.

22:55.792 --> 22:57.377
Okay?

23:00.088 --> 23:02.257
So you can come home too.

23:25.030 --> 23:27.365
<i>And why couldn't you touch her?</i>

23:27.783 --> 23:28.950
Well, she was--

23:29.117 --> 23:31.995
You know, it's a mental hospital.
People have issues.

23:32.162 --> 23:34.664
I mean, that's what I thought then.

23:34.831 --> 23:36.625
- Now--
- Uh, how long were you together...

23:36.792 --> 23:39.586
- ...before the incident?
- Can we take a break?

23:40.378 --> 23:41.671
Please, I-- Just--

23:41.838 --> 23:44.549
Without the meds,
it's really hard to keep things....

23:44.716 --> 23:48.386
Of course. And there's, uh, food coming.

23:48.553 --> 23:50.889
I promise. But let's take a break.

23:52.015 --> 23:53.892
We'll pick this up again in 30 minutes.

24:06.738 --> 24:07.989
Cue the phone.

24:27.968 --> 24:32.264
<i>Floor to Bravo Tango,
inside the building. Building is secure.</i>

24:47.863 --> 24:51.700
Very, very good. It's a real surprise.

24:51.867 --> 24:52.951
How does it look?

24:53.118 --> 24:55.829
He's twitchy.

24:55.996 --> 24:58.248
- You said he was off his meds?
- For a week now.

24:58.415 --> 25:01.293
They think that may be why
the spike in telepathic activity.

25:01.459 --> 25:03.420
So is he crazy, or...?

25:03.587 --> 25:06.715
Well, I think he's telling the truth
as he knows it.

25:06.882 --> 25:09.759
- Meaning?
- Well, he believes he's mentally ill.

25:09.926 --> 25:14.389
But at the same time, part of him knows
that the power is real.

25:14.556 --> 25:18.476
And are we clear
on the scope and nature of this power?

25:18.643 --> 25:22.522
No, but if the readings are right,
he may be the most powerful mutant...

25:22.689 --> 25:25.233
- ...that we have ever encountered.
- Hmm.

25:25.609 --> 25:29.905
After what happened in Red Hook,
I'd say that's an understatement.

25:31.740 --> 25:34.201
So he has the power...

25:34.367 --> 25:40.373
...but he doesn't understand it
or know how to control it?

25:40.540 --> 25:43.168
I'd like to dig deeper,
see if we can figure out what triggers him.

25:43.335 --> 25:45.587
Division One thinks we should kill him.

25:45.754 --> 25:49.549
Now, before he realizes what he is.

25:49.716 --> 25:52.844
- We may never get the chance again.
- That would be a mistake.

25:53.011 --> 25:56.181
We've never had a subject
like this before. I mean....

25:57.057 --> 25:58.558
Look.

25:58.767 --> 26:01.102
Just give me until the end of the day...

26:01.269 --> 26:03.813
...and you have the gas if you need it.

26:05.607 --> 26:07.150
<i>Okay.</i>

26:07.317 --> 26:12.197
<i>But if he so much as farts too loud,
we're moving to level two.</i>

26:36.888 --> 26:38.807
Could I be alone?

27:07.961 --> 27:10.046
Shut down again? Is that what you'll do?

27:10.213 --> 27:11.548
- Leave me alone!
- Look at me.

27:11.715 --> 27:13.466
I don't wanna talk about it, okay?

27:13.633 --> 27:15.385
God!

27:19.556 --> 27:21.016
<i>What are you doing?</i>

29:08.164 --> 29:10.542
- Did we eat?
- What?

29:11.501 --> 29:13.545
- Right over there.
- Yes, sir.

29:14.462 --> 29:16.297
Wait, wait, wait. What's that for?

29:16.464 --> 29:18.842
It's just a few tests.
They're readings, really.

29:19.008 --> 29:22.554
We wanna see what happens
in your brain when you feel things.

29:22.720 --> 29:24.305
What things? Stop. Look.

29:25.890 --> 29:27.183
I want a lawyer, okay?

29:27.350 --> 29:30.895
I was willing to cooperate before,
but now I'm tired. I'm just so--

29:31.062 --> 29:32.605
David.

29:32.939 --> 29:35.525
I need you to stay calm.

29:59.716 --> 30:01.551
You're afraid of me.

30:01.926 --> 30:03.845
David, please.

30:04.387 --> 30:06.431
I'm afraid for you.

30:06.598 --> 30:10.059
You're a very sick young man
who stopped taking his medication.

30:10.560 --> 30:16.858
Are you a danger to yourself or to others?
I think that's what we're here to ascertain.

30:38.379 --> 30:40.048
Okay?

30:49.015 --> 30:50.058
Good.

30:50.225 --> 30:52.852
Now, let's talk about the incident...

30:53.019 --> 30:55.355
...at Clockworks.

31:31.724 --> 31:33.768
You can send him a note.

31:33.935 --> 31:36.604
It's probably better anyway.

32:17.687 --> 32:20.565
Alvarez, four pills.

32:23.860 --> 32:27.905
Don't forget, you've got an appointment
with Dr. Schubert on Thursday.

32:28.573 --> 32:30.783
- Hey, where is he?
- Who, the kid?

32:30.950 --> 32:33.161
He's, uh, climbing a mountain.

32:33.328 --> 32:36.372
He's got his clamp on wrong.

32:39.834 --> 32:41.794
Hey, would you--? Hold on.

32:44.631 --> 32:46.424
It's lady stuff.

32:48.593 --> 32:50.345
They've got this candy bar.

32:50.511 --> 32:52.555
It's new, I saw it on TV.

32:52.889 --> 32:57.894
<i>With nougat and chocolate and,
like, this crispy wafer.</i>

32:58.061 --> 33:03.441
If you could buy one and, like, mail it to me,
that would be great.

33:16.329 --> 33:18.414
I was looking for you.

33:18.581 --> 33:20.124
<i>David.</i>

33:20.291 --> 33:22.001
<i>No.</i>

33:22.293 --> 33:23.961
<i>No.</i>

33:34.430 --> 33:37.600
<i>Twinkle, twinkle, little star</i>

33:38.518 --> 33:41.562
<i>- Come on, David. Go.
- That's great, David. Keep pedaling.</i>

33:41.729 --> 33:44.440
<i>- You went off your medication.
- You were nervous.</i>

33:44.607 --> 33:46.359
<i>- Wanna be my girlfriend?
- Calm down.</i>

33:46.526 --> 33:50.655
<i>- Why are the hot ones always so crazy?
- David, calm down.</i>

34:02.792 --> 34:05.461
Syd. Shit. Syd.

34:06.963 --> 34:08.423
Are you okay?

34:20.101 --> 34:21.602
No!

34:23.354 --> 34:25.314
Hey, be cool, man.

34:25.481 --> 34:26.524
Come on.

34:26.691 --> 34:29.736
No. No, no, no, don't!

34:29.902 --> 34:31.696
- No, no, no!
- Get him out of here!

34:31.863 --> 34:33.239
- David, calm down.
- Stop!

34:33.406 --> 34:35.533
- Don't! Stop! Stop!
- Stay back. Let us take care of it.

34:35.700 --> 34:38.995
- Back off, David, now.
- Stop! Stop! No, no!

34:39.162 --> 34:41.748
No, don't! Stop, stop!

34:41.914 --> 34:44.333
No! No! No!

34:44.500 --> 34:45.835
No! Don't! Stop!

34:46.002 --> 34:47.587
Stop! Stop!

34:47.754 --> 34:49.839
- Stop! No!
- Stay out of the way.

34:50.006 --> 34:51.340
No!

35:05.646 --> 35:08.441
<i>Attention, all floors. All stations.</i>

35:08.608 --> 35:11.277
<i>We are on mandatory lockdown.</i>

35:16.157 --> 35:18.159
Are you okay?

35:19.619 --> 35:20.912
Did you hit your head?

35:21.204 --> 35:24.332
- No, I'm just a little dizzy.
- I'm so sorry.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.001
- Hey, be cool.
- No! Please.

35:27.168 --> 35:30.004
Come on. Ease up, brother.
He's in the yellow.

35:30.171 --> 35:33.049
- Don't. Stop.
- Don't harass the guy. Come on, man.

35:33.216 --> 35:36.385
Everybody, nothing to see here.
Everybody take a dose, man.

35:36.552 --> 35:38.554
You've gotta cool your body. Just....

35:41.849 --> 35:45.144
What? What is it? What's happening?

36:14.715 --> 36:16.384
- No. It feels--
- Now, keep still.

36:16.551 --> 36:18.511
- I think you may--
- Wrong.

36:22.598 --> 36:25.768
- Uh, stay here.
- Wait.

37:08.394 --> 37:12.231
Uh, stop. Would you say that again?

37:12.398 --> 37:14.692
I said I looked in the mirror,
and I was her.

37:14.859 --> 37:15.985
Who?

37:16.152 --> 37:18.237
- Sydney.
- She was there with you?

37:18.404 --> 37:20.740
No. She would....

37:21.282 --> 37:23.159
Somehow, we--

37:23.326 --> 37:27.413
She took my place
and I took hers when we kissed, I guess.

37:27.580 --> 37:29.540
But it wasn't me. I didn't-- It was her.

37:29.707 --> 37:33.502
Her power, I think. I mean,
I guess that's why she didn't wanna--

37:33.669 --> 37:36.255
Look, I know. Okay. But you asked.

37:36.797 --> 37:39.759
Look, forget it. I don't need this.

37:54.231 --> 37:57.443
Look. I have been more than....

37:58.194 --> 38:01.113
But now, I really wanna get out of here.

38:02.073 --> 38:03.824
Calm.

38:03.991 --> 38:05.409
Be calm.

38:05.576 --> 38:07.787
Nobody is....

38:07.954 --> 38:09.956
I just wanna make sure I've got it right.

38:10.748 --> 38:12.083
You were her.

38:12.249 --> 38:14.335
She was you.

38:17.672 --> 38:19.423
Continue.

38:32.603 --> 38:37.149
<i>Attention on all floors,
all stations. We are on mandatory lockdown.</i>

38:38.776 --> 38:41.320
<i>Lockdown protocols are now in effect.</i>

39:23.612 --> 39:25.865
Help!

39:26.032 --> 39:28.200
Help!

39:39.253 --> 39:40.296
Help!

39:41.213 --> 39:43.215
Help!

39:43.758 --> 39:45.342
Help!

39:50.056 --> 39:52.391
Let me out of here!

39:52.558 --> 39:54.393
Oh, my God!

40:13.454 --> 40:15.915
Where are the doors?

40:28.969 --> 40:30.763
David!

40:37.019 --> 40:39.188
Let me out now!

40:39.355 --> 40:41.607
Help me!

41:34.493 --> 41:37.037
Get us out!

41:39.081 --> 41:42.126
David! David!

41:42.293 --> 41:44.753
Get us out!

41:46.630 --> 41:50.301
David! David!

41:50.467 --> 41:52.928
Wait. You said, her power.

41:53.095 --> 41:55.347
Are you saying
the girl has some kind of--?

41:55.514 --> 41:56.974
What, uh...?

41:57.266 --> 42:00.311
Extrasensory powers?

42:00.561 --> 42:03.647
Look, I don't know. But that's the only--
Because it wasn't me.

42:03.814 --> 42:07.193
At least I didn't think-- It didn't feel
like before, the other times.

42:07.359 --> 42:09.904
- Not that I....
- I know. But, David, Lenny is dead.

42:10.070 --> 42:13.407
Somehow, she ended up
inside of a solid wall...

42:13.574 --> 42:15.576
...so I'm just trying, um--

42:15.743 --> 42:17.620
You're saying, the girl--

42:17.786 --> 42:22.333
That you kissed the girl,
and she switched places with you?

42:32.509 --> 42:35.930
- I'm doing you a favor.
- You don't understand. She's still in there.

42:36.096 --> 42:40.351
The questions you're gonna get asked,
you may lose your shot at a discharge.

42:40.517 --> 42:43.687
Now, you be careful out there.

42:43.854 --> 42:46.357
Please, wait. I'm not Sydney.

42:46.523 --> 42:49.443
Don't forget to fill your prescription.

43:15.344 --> 43:17.012
- Wait.
- Wait. What?

43:18.180 --> 43:20.849
- You were there.
- I was there?

43:21.684 --> 43:24.937
Yes. You were the man
in the car at the hospital.

43:25.104 --> 43:27.690
<i>So I'm clear, after you entered
the body of a woman...</i>

43:27.856 --> 43:31.026
<i>...and escaped from a mental hospital
where all the patients...</i>

43:31.193 --> 43:35.489
...had been sealed inside of their rooms,
you think you saw me getting out of a car?

43:36.573 --> 43:38.909
You don't have to be a dick about it.
It was you.

43:39.493 --> 43:40.744
Hey, no. You're wrong.

43:40.911 --> 43:44.623
In fact, that is one of the things
that we-- That I need to know.

43:44.790 --> 43:47.126
Who were the people
at the hospital that day?

43:47.293 --> 43:49.795
No. No, no, no. You're lying.

43:49.962 --> 43:53.173
- You're trying to confuse me, and-- No.
- David. David.

43:53.340 --> 43:54.466
No.

43:56.260 --> 43:58.804
David.

44:01.515 --> 44:03.559
David.

44:04.476 --> 44:06.520
Just take a deep breath.

44:06.687 --> 44:07.938
Try to be calm.

44:08.105 --> 44:10.858
Just try to relax, David.

44:21.910 --> 44:23.996
The gas, now.

44:24.163 --> 44:26.248
Use the gas.

44:26.415 --> 44:27.458
Use the gas.

44:31.795 --> 44:38.218
<i>Here we go</i>

44:39.887 --> 44:44.600
<i>Now</i>

45:46.578 --> 45:48.288
<i>David.</i>

45:48.705 --> 45:50.165
<i>My boy.</i>

45:53.377 --> 45:56.463
<i>My beautiful boy.</i>

45:58.048 --> 45:59.883
<i>Mommy loves you.</i>

46:00.592 --> 46:02.719
<i>She does.</i>

46:06.723 --> 46:08.434
<i>My boy.</i>

46:13.981 --> 46:15.732
<i>David.</i>

46:18.527 --> 46:20.821
<i>David, where are you?</i>

47:08.327 --> 47:09.703
Trick or treat.

47:09.870 --> 47:11.413
So exciting.

47:11.580 --> 47:13.207
Careful.

47:37.940 --> 47:40.442
What are you supposed to be?

47:43.445 --> 47:46.406
- Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.

47:49.826 --> 47:51.119
Hi.

47:51.620 --> 47:53.413
Hi.

47:54.206 --> 47:56.416
They sent me home. And then I realized--

47:56.583 --> 47:58.877
I mean, the apartment's gone.

47:59.586 --> 48:01.213
So....

48:03.715 --> 48:05.842
Just for a few days?

48:11.348 --> 48:12.766
Of course.

48:12.933 --> 48:15.978
Uh, I'll talk to Ben.

48:16.311 --> 48:17.521
Come in. Come in.

48:19.773 --> 48:22.776
Avast, I've got Snapjacks
and red Krusteaz.

48:22.943 --> 48:26.488
Har! Har....

48:27.531 --> 48:29.283
- Holy shit.
- Ben.

48:29.449 --> 48:31.994
You remember my brother, David?

48:32.160 --> 48:35.539
- Yeah.
- Do you guys have any waffles?

48:36.164 --> 48:38.458
- Yup.
- Yeah.

48:46.258 --> 48:47.593
Wow.

48:47.759 --> 48:49.720
You weren't kidding.

48:50.679 --> 48:51.680
Uh....

48:51.847 --> 48:53.432
Another one?

48:54.391 --> 48:56.059
Here you go.

49:10.198 --> 49:12.951
- Heh.
- Is this...?

49:14.578 --> 49:16.371
Will this be okay?

49:17.456 --> 49:19.541
Yeah. I mean, this is....

49:20.000 --> 49:21.668
This is great.

49:22.210 --> 49:27.049
Uh, so, you know, Ben works early.

49:27.215 --> 49:30.052
And I'll probably be gone
when you wake up.

49:30.218 --> 49:34.181
So, um, you know, make yourself at home.

49:34.348 --> 49:36.600
Don't answer the phone.

49:39.478 --> 49:40.979
Okay.

49:45.859 --> 49:47.069
It's good.

49:47.235 --> 49:48.654
It's gonna be good.

49:50.447 --> 49:51.490
Okay?

49:51.657 --> 49:53.116
Yeah.

50:23.939 --> 50:25.565
So, what did it feel like, huh?

50:27.484 --> 50:29.361
Titties.

50:31.613 --> 50:34.074
Having titties. Did you...?

50:34.658 --> 50:36.451
If that were me, all day I'd....

50:43.291 --> 50:46.420
Stop looking at me like that, man.

50:46.586 --> 50:48.422
I know.

50:48.588 --> 50:50.173
I'm dead.

50:50.716 --> 50:53.093
You killed me.

50:53.385 --> 50:56.513
And I gotta say, not cool, man.

50:56.680 --> 50:57.764
I didn't.

50:57.931 --> 50:59.391
Yeah, you did.

51:00.100 --> 51:02.018
Don't blame her. Don't blame her.

51:02.185 --> 51:04.604
She was just a--

51:04.771 --> 51:06.273
What do you--?

51:06.690 --> 51:09.401
--passenger riding around in your body.

51:09.568 --> 51:13.363
Don't give a newbie a bazooka
and act surprised when she blows shit up.

51:13.530 --> 51:15.449
Lenny.

51:15.615 --> 51:18.785
- I'm sorry, man.
- No. It's cool.

51:18.952 --> 51:20.537
It's cool.

51:20.704 --> 51:24.166
What, was I gonna spend
the rest of my life...

51:24.332 --> 51:26.877
...popping pills from a little cup?

51:28.003 --> 51:30.589
Don't worry about me.

51:30.797 --> 51:33.884
It's you that's got problems.

51:36.386 --> 51:38.805
They're coming for you, babe.

51:42.642 --> 51:44.269
Who?

51:45.020 --> 51:46.605
They know about the hospital.

51:46.772 --> 51:49.274
- What you did.
- I didn't.

51:49.441 --> 51:51.651
What she did when she was you.

51:51.818 --> 51:54.237
Had your powers.

51:54.988 --> 51:57.783
They're coming,
and they're gonna kill you.

51:57.949 --> 51:59.785
- No, no, no.
- Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

51:59.951 --> 52:01.995
No. No.

52:03.079 --> 52:04.539
- No. No.
- They are.

52:04.706 --> 52:07.083
This is just my-- No, this is not real. It's--

52:07.250 --> 52:10.128
I told them. Don't cut my meds. I'm just--

52:13.340 --> 52:15.509
Ah, no.

52:15.675 --> 52:17.552
- David?
- Mm-hmm?

52:17.761 --> 52:19.221
Yeah.

52:20.680 --> 52:22.224
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

52:22.390 --> 52:25.644
Sorry. I, uh, just, uh, broke the lamp.

52:25.811 --> 52:27.229
- Um....
- Oh.

52:27.395 --> 52:28.730
Sorry.

52:28.897 --> 52:30.398
No. It's, um--

52:31.441 --> 52:33.151
It's okay.

52:36.154 --> 52:38.782
It's just-- You know, Ben.

52:38.949 --> 52:41.618
He's gotta get to the garden
tomorrow morning, you know?

52:41.785 --> 52:42.953
Sure. Okay.

52:46.164 --> 52:47.791
Get some rest. Night.

52:51.002 --> 52:52.504
Good night.

53:04.558 --> 53:06.393
<i>David.</i>

53:08.228 --> 53:09.980
<i>David.</i>

53:17.195 --> 53:18.321
<i>They're coming and--</i>

53:19.447 --> 53:21.116
<i>And then they're gonna kill you.</i>

53:42.178 --> 53:43.889
<i>David.</i>

53:53.523 --> 53:55.525
<i>David.</i>

54:00.655 --> 54:02.324
<i>David.</i>

54:04.159 --> 54:05.744
Wake up.

54:14.336 --> 54:15.921
David.

54:17.297 --> 54:19.049
Over here.

54:20.091 --> 54:21.426
Let's stop pretending, huh?

54:21.718 --> 54:24.179
Those are power cables.
You're submerged in water.

54:24.346 --> 54:27.933
If you try anything, you're gonna get
100,000 volts before you take a breath.

54:30.060 --> 54:32.312
What is so funny?

54:34.981 --> 54:38.026
I'm insane, you idiot.

54:38.193 --> 54:40.362
This is my delusion.

54:41.905 --> 54:43.615
It's not real.

54:44.991 --> 54:47.494
Stop screwing around. Where's the girl?

54:47.661 --> 54:48.745
What girl?

54:48.912 --> 54:52.457
Don't be clever, David.
We know who you are.

54:52.624 --> 54:55.961
We know they came for her
at the hospital thinking she was you.

54:56.127 --> 54:58.129
No. You took her at the hospital.

54:58.296 --> 55:00.757
- You were there.
- No, David.

55:00.924 --> 55:03.301
It's clear now what happened.

55:03.468 --> 55:07.847
They came for you but got her by accident,
and we've got you, but we want her too.

55:08.014 --> 55:11.226
So just tell me, or....

55:24.739 --> 55:26.866
She was gone.

55:27.409 --> 55:29.703
I went looking for her.

55:31.538 --> 55:33.581
She was gone.

55:35.000 --> 55:37.293
Yeah. I'm, uh, looking for a patient.

55:38.837 --> 55:40.880
Sydney Barrett.

55:43.425 --> 55:45.719
No, I'm her father.

55:46.261 --> 55:48.013
Max.

55:55.562 --> 55:56.855
Hold on, what?

55:57.647 --> 55:59.107
Well, how--?

55:59.274 --> 56:01.818
How can you have no record of her?
She was--

56:01.985 --> 56:04.195
Syd Barrett. She-- I--

56:04.362 --> 56:07.615
Well, how--? I visited her.

57:30.990 --> 57:33.201
Don't stop.

57:36.371 --> 57:38.081
I said, don't stop.

57:38.581 --> 57:40.375
Wait. How did you--?

57:40.542 --> 57:43.461
I've been looking,
and no one would tell me-- Syd.

57:43.628 --> 57:45.547
I don't understand. I was you.

57:45.713 --> 57:49.551
Did that really--? We kiss--
And I know I'm crazy, but that felt really--

57:49.717 --> 57:51.302
David, hush.

57:51.469 --> 57:54.305
- I'm not really here.
- What do you mean?

57:54.472 --> 57:56.808
- Where else would you be?
- This is your memory...

57:56.975 --> 58:00.228
...of the day you called the hospital,
not the actual day.

58:00.395 --> 58:02.480
I'm inside your memory.

58:02.647 --> 58:03.982
Heh, but that's not--

58:06.860 --> 58:11.447
- I've been projected into your memory.
- I've been looking. No one would tell me.

58:11.614 --> 58:13.783
Syd, I don't understand. I was you--

58:13.950 --> 58:15.994
David, stop. I'm not really here.

58:17.579 --> 58:19.581
What do you mean?
Where else would you be?

58:19.747 --> 58:23.376
This is your memory
of the day you called the hospital.

58:24.085 --> 58:26.171
I've been projected into your memory.

58:26.337 --> 58:29.257
We're not on the street, not really.
We're in your mind.

58:29.424 --> 58:32.677
- They can't track us in here.
- Who? How is that--?

58:32.844 --> 58:35.555
We don't have much time.
You're in a government facility.

58:35.722 --> 58:37.473
I know. They said they were cops.

58:37.640 --> 58:38.725
They're not cops.

58:38.892 --> 58:42.145
I'll tell you everything soon.
But that's not what we're gonna do now.

58:42.312 --> 58:44.022
You're in a government facility.

58:44.189 --> 58:47.150
- What are we--?
- You'll go for a swim. And I'll get you out.

58:47.317 --> 58:49.444
- A swim?
- Slowly, so they don't notice...

58:49.611 --> 58:51.696
...slide out of your chair
and into the water.

58:51.863 --> 58:54.782
And when you see the lights,
don't come up until you see me.

58:54.949 --> 58:56.743
David?

59:15.094 --> 59:17.347
There was a van.

59:17.513 --> 59:19.390
Yes. That was us.

59:19.557 --> 59:22.268
Who were the other two people?
The people who chased you?

59:22.435 --> 59:24.562
The ones who came to the hospital?

59:26.689 --> 59:30.109
David, are you with me?

59:32.445 --> 59:34.030
Yes.

59:37.367 --> 59:39.285
I'm here.

59:48.419 --> 59:50.588
It wasn't you...

59:50.838 --> 59:52.799
...at the hospital.

59:53.591 --> 59:55.843
Yeah. I told you.

59:56.511 --> 59:58.471
It wasn't you.

1:00:01.266 --> 1:00:05.478
<i>Slide out of your chair
and into the water, slowly.</i>

1:00:13.152 --> 1:00:14.696
Watch him.

1:00:14.862 --> 1:00:17.740
He's making me nervous.

1:00:24.497 --> 1:00:25.915
Hey, David.

1:00:26.082 --> 1:00:27.750
I really need you to stay calm.

1:00:27.917 --> 1:00:32.213
And please,
do not make me press this button.

1:00:37.760 --> 1:00:39.053
Who are you people?

1:00:39.220 --> 1:00:42.473
No. I ask the questions.

1:00:47.770 --> 1:00:49.272
The girl.

1:00:49.439 --> 1:00:51.816
Where is the girl?

1:00:54.110 --> 1:00:55.903
I think you're about to find out.

1:01:02.910 --> 1:01:04.120
Do it now!

1:01:28.561 --> 1:01:29.771
Hi.

1:01:42.825 --> 1:01:44.660
Hi.

1:01:50.333 --> 1:01:51.793
David, don't.

1:01:51.959 --> 1:01:54.754
- I'm sorry. You can't touch my skin.
- Yes.

1:01:56.297 --> 1:01:57.715
This is Ptonomy.

1:01:59.133 --> 1:02:01.552
- And that's Kerry.
- Hey.

1:02:01.719 --> 1:02:03.346
Oh, hey.

1:02:04.263 --> 1:02:05.723
Hi.

1:02:05.890 --> 1:02:08.726
- Sorry about before.
- It's cool.

1:02:08.893 --> 1:02:11.938
- We like chasing after people.
- No. We like catching people.

1:02:12.105 --> 1:02:13.940
- Syd.
- We gotta go.

1:02:14.107 --> 1:02:15.691
Melanie's waiting.

1:02:16.984 --> 1:02:18.194
Who?

1:02:26.077 --> 1:02:30.540
Come on! Let's go, go, go!

1:02:34.293 --> 1:02:38.673
- Move, move, move!
- Fall back! Fall back!

1:02:40.842 --> 1:02:43.010
Keep moving!

1:02:52.562 --> 1:02:55.022
Move! Go, go, go!

1:03:08.703 --> 1:03:10.246
Go, this way.

1:03:10.413 --> 1:03:11.914
Go.

1:03:14.876 --> 1:03:16.836
Come on.

1:03:37.607 --> 1:03:40.109
- Syd, this is-- Wait.
- We can't stop. They're coming.

1:03:40.276 --> 1:03:42.028
I need you to stop. Please, Sydney.

1:03:42.195 --> 1:03:44.572
I have to know.

1:03:45.198 --> 1:03:46.282
Is--?

1:03:46.449 --> 1:03:47.950
Is this--?

1:03:48.367 --> 1:03:52.205
Is this real? I mean,
what if we're back at the hospital?

1:03:52.371 --> 1:03:54.665
What if none of this ever happened,
and we're--?

1:03:54.832 --> 1:03:57.960
Please, I have to know.

1:03:58.503 --> 1:04:00.713
Are you real?

1:04:01.839 --> 1:04:03.549
I'm real.

1:04:04.926 --> 1:04:06.636
This is real.

1:04:06.802 --> 1:04:08.387
Okay?

1:04:09.263 --> 1:04:11.057
I'm here.

1:04:11.724 --> 1:04:14.477
I came back for you. I love you.

1:04:16.479 --> 1:04:18.064
Okay?

1:04:18.231 --> 1:04:19.899
Okay.

1:04:23.486 --> 1:04:26.489
- You gonna say it too?
- I love you.

1:04:27.198 --> 1:04:29.075
We gotta go.

1:04:33.454 --> 1:04:35.289
Ms. Bird.

1:04:35.665 --> 1:04:37.792
This is David.

1:04:40.461 --> 1:04:42.338
Come on, son.

1:04:46.551 --> 1:04:47.927
Take my hand.
