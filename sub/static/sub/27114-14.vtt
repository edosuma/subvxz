(man)
Previously
on "Love & Hip Hop"...

00:04.038 --> 00:06.672
(speaking Spanish)

00:06.741 --> 00:09.074
Chop chop,
time to be riser, man.

00:09.143 --> 00:11.076
It's about time.
She had a baby for you.

00:11.145 --> 00:14.480
Pap was saying, "You should
propose no matter what."

00:14.548 --> 00:16.915
Wait a minute.
What are you doing?

00:16.984 --> 00:19.218
I'm resting.
Get out of here!

00:19.286 --> 00:22.021
(Joe)
I saw something
that was flirty,

00:22.089 --> 00:23.589
and, yes, I'm pissed.

00:23.657 --> 00:26.892
I don't give a (bleep)
who you are.

00:26.961 --> 00:30.162
I do not tolerate
disrespect.

00:30.231 --> 00:31.430
(Remy)
In the past two weeks,

00:31.499 --> 00:33.699
I've been really feeling,
like, pregnant, like...

00:33.768 --> 00:36.735
Nobody said the birth
of the golden child
was gonna be easy.

00:36.804 --> 00:38.904
You're not birthing
just a regular child.

00:38.973 --> 00:40.539
What should I get
for Mommy?

00:40.608 --> 00:42.307
A ring.
A ring?!

00:42.376 --> 00:44.410
Get married.
Juelz said get married.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.512
Yay!

00:46.580 --> 00:48.981
You're not just doing this
because you're going away?

00:49.050 --> 00:51.650
No, I mean, that's
the person I wanna spend

00:51.719 --> 00:53.919
my life with
at the end of the day.

00:53.988 --> 00:55.521
And this
conversation is over.

00:55.589 --> 00:56.855
Let's just tell the truth.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.324
Bitch, this is why...
Watch your mouth.

00:59.393 --> 01:01.627
Watch your mouth.
Watch your mouth.

01:01.695 --> 01:03.228
Watch your mouth.
What you gonna do?

01:03.297 --> 01:05.664
She had a lot
of stuff built up
that I never knew.

01:05.733 --> 01:07.433
I just woke up today
feeling like...

01:07.501 --> 01:09.935
I 'm really not okay
with us just going in
our separate ways

01:10.004 --> 01:11.236
and being enemies.
Mm-hmm.

01:11.305 --> 01:15.140
Safaree (bleep) is booed up
with the matching minks.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.976
Safaree, you don't
feel like you owe me
and my lady an apology?

01:18.045 --> 01:19.812
No.
What are we
talking about, though?

01:19.880 --> 01:21.447
(bleep) care.
Oh!

01:21.515 --> 01:22.514
I'll put this (bleep) face
in the sand.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.050
Don't play with me!

01:25.119 --> 01:28.053
♪♪

01:51.112 --> 01:52.411
(Joe)
You hear me, my (bleep)?

01:52.480 --> 01:54.012
I'm not playing with you.
Baby, listen--

01:54.081 --> 01:55.280
What the (bleep)?

01:55.349 --> 01:57.282
No, this (bleep)
held me kid!

01:57.351 --> 01:59.118
Ill put this (bleep)
face in the sand.

01:59.186 --> 02:03.589
Don't play with me!
What the (bleep)
is wrong with you?

02:03.657 --> 02:06.325
Sit down.

02:06.393 --> 02:09.361
My lady is not spending
time with nobody here,

02:09.430 --> 02:11.363
so I don't know,
why does anyone care

02:11.432 --> 02:12.664
if she's here or not?

02:12.733 --> 02:14.299
There's absolutely nothing
in this situation

02:14.368 --> 02:17.669
that Joe could say
that makes me feel like,

02:17.738 --> 02:19.471
"You know what?
Yeah, you're right."

02:19.540 --> 02:21.140
Mind your
mother(bleep) business,

02:21.208 --> 02:23.509
and I'm gonna do
the same thing, period.

02:23.577 --> 02:24.810
I don't gotta report
to nobody.

02:24.879 --> 02:26.278
I don't work
for nobody here.

02:26.347 --> 02:29.081
So say that then!
Y'all don't care
about your friendship?

02:29.150 --> 02:30.883
If that's a relationship
you're ready to put at risk

02:30.951 --> 02:33.819
for some (bleep),
it further
confirms my point

02:33.888 --> 02:35.888
about your and your
arrested development.

02:35.956 --> 02:37.990
Mmm.
You should work on it.

02:38.058 --> 02:40.359
He's like
a (bleep) child.

02:40.427 --> 02:43.262
(Joe)
Yo, honestly, I'm never
fighting Safaree,

02:43.330 --> 02:46.031
But I don't just
leave things in the air.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.966
My man owes me an apology.

02:48.035 --> 02:49.568
(Juju)
Here's the thing, though.

02:49.637 --> 02:52.938
This is a trip where
many people sitting here

02:53.007 --> 02:55.340
you know for a fact
do not get along with her.

02:55.409 --> 02:57.276
Why even bring her here
and not tell us?

02:57.344 --> 02:59.011
It's nobody's business.

02:59.079 --> 03:00.779
Let me
tell you something.

03:00.848 --> 03:01.847
This ain't
your vacation, sweetheart.

03:01.916 --> 03:04.716
You ain't in Costa Rica
on a honeymoon.

03:04.785 --> 03:05.884
You're on a trip
with a whole bunch
of other people.

03:05.953 --> 03:08.253
That means you,
unfortunately, at this time,

03:08.322 --> 03:11.156
you have to take everybody's
feelings into consideration.

03:11.225 --> 03:14.059
This ain't "Safaree
and Shawty Time."

03:14.128 --> 03:16.495
Well, he's on Juju's trip,
and-- which is even worse.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.997
Oh, my God!
You went and brought
up a bigger point!

03:19.066 --> 03:22.167
Part of being a man
is saying what you mean
and meaning what you say.

03:22.236 --> 03:24.036
Period.
I'm not here to
point no finger at you

03:24.104 --> 03:25.137
or come at you
in no kind of way,

03:25.206 --> 03:27.806
but what I'm talking about
is just man business

03:27.875 --> 03:29.942
on how you just deal
and how you work
with others.

03:30.010 --> 03:31.476
There's
a relationship there,

03:31.545 --> 03:34.279
and he felt like that
you had an opportunity
to be real with him,

03:34.348 --> 03:36.348
because this is how
you save away from

03:36.417 --> 03:38.450
moments like this
where people feel like...

03:38.519 --> 03:40.519
You playing with 'em.
Right.
You know what I mean?

03:40.588 --> 03:41.787
I know you guys
love each other.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.322
I'm never gonna take
one side or another.

03:43.390 --> 03:45.390
It's just about
the principle
of communication.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.259
It's-- I mean--

03:47.328 --> 03:48.961
You not having
eye contact with me,

03:49.029 --> 03:51.063
like, it shows me, like,
you don't even really care.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.864
It's all good.
It's (bleep) old.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.800
It's (bleep) old.
But it's about the principle.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.035
Um, let's move on
with the exercise.

03:57.104 --> 03:58.870
You guys can write down
as many things as you want.

03:58.939 --> 04:00.205
You can draw
whatever you want.

04:00.274 --> 04:02.674
Let's just write down
everything that you want to,

04:02.743 --> 04:05.611
you know,
burn and leave here.

04:05.679 --> 04:07.279
♪♪

04:07.348 --> 04:09.815
(Safaree)
Fools argue with fools.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.450
I'm not really
in a headspace

04:11.518 --> 04:13.952
to be sitting there and
be arguing with this man

04:14.021 --> 04:15.621
and be yelling,
looking like a maniac.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.189
It just doesn't make
any sense.

04:17.258 --> 04:20.492
Okay, so I'll start,
since, um,

04:20.561 --> 04:21.760
I brought you guys here.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.962
On this trip,
I realized that

04:24.031 --> 04:26.131
part of me
not moving forward

04:26.200 --> 04:28.734
with my personal life
or give anyone a chance

04:28.802 --> 04:30.636
is because I'm still holding
onto a lot of baggage

04:30.704 --> 04:32.838
from my previous
relationship.

04:32.906 --> 04:35.307
And I'm holding onto the hurt
and the pain of it.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.943
So, today
I'm burning that,

04:38.012 --> 04:40.412
and I'm no longer
gonna carry any more hurt

04:40.481 --> 04:43.515
or any more pain.
Yes, yes!

04:43.584 --> 04:46.151
(applause)
Yeah!

04:46.220 --> 04:48.420
I wrote a couple
of things literally.

04:48.489 --> 04:51.823
Anger and taking things
too personally, right?

04:51.892 --> 04:55.394
So I'm trying
to get a hold of
managing my aggression.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.262
I'm getting
to a better place,

04:57.331 --> 04:58.830
you know, with that.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.499
And part of me
getting to that place

05:00.567 --> 05:02.134
is actually being
in a relationship

05:02.202 --> 05:05.037
that'll help me be able
to care about somebody
other than myself.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.972
You know?
I'm hoping I can get better.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.074
You will get better.

05:09.143 --> 05:11.677
Yeah, Maino.
(all cheering)

05:11.745 --> 05:14.313
Anger is the emotion
that I-- I probably felt

05:14.381 --> 05:16.014
most comfortable with.

05:16.083 --> 05:18.150
You know, I'm a product
of my environment.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.751
Being in a relationship
with Maggie

05:19.820 --> 05:21.586
forces me
to exercise patience.

05:21.655 --> 05:24.923
I'm trying to learn how to
not internalize everything.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.792
Try not to take
everything personal.

05:26.860 --> 05:29.361
So I'm trying to leave all
that (bleep) back here
in Costa Rica, man.

05:29.430 --> 05:32.597
Okay, so I wrote

05:32.666 --> 05:34.800
not having
the proper childhood.

05:34.868 --> 05:39.438
Oftentimes when I get mad
or I get emotional,

05:39.506 --> 05:41.740
I think back to how
I grew up

05:41.809 --> 05:44.209
and how I was raised,
and, you know,

05:44.278 --> 05:47.045
how I had to mature
before it was time
for me to do so.

05:47.114 --> 05:49.781
So, I just wanna
let go of not having

05:49.850 --> 05:52.250
the proper childhood
that I should have.

05:52.319 --> 05:54.886
(applause)
Yeah!

05:54.955 --> 05:57.089
Burn it,
make sure it burns.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.990
Mine is...

05:59.059 --> 06:02.994
dissention, anger, hurt,
confusion, and discord.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.896
Man, you got
mad (bleep) to burn.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.965
I do, um, and I think that

06:07.034 --> 06:09.401
so many relationships
get messed up,

06:09.470 --> 06:13.038
get (bleep) over because
of a lack of communication,

06:13.107 --> 06:15.741
you know, and I think
even with me and you.

06:15.809 --> 06:18.777
There is a huge lack
of communication

06:18.846 --> 06:21.146
that has happened,
and it caused dissention,

06:21.215 --> 06:24.249
it caused discord, and just
a whole bunch of confusion.

06:24.318 --> 06:26.351
And, um...

06:26.420 --> 06:29.221
(voice breaking)
What I feel like is...

06:29.289 --> 06:34.092
We've allowed people
to say things and do things,

06:34.161 --> 06:37.295
and things
have gotten too far.

06:37.364 --> 06:39.765
And I feel like
you should know

06:39.833 --> 06:43.235
if we make a pact,
and it's Kim ain't
tell me to say something,

06:43.303 --> 06:45.170
I'm not saying nothing.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.906
I'm gonna hold you down
till the day I die.

06:47.975 --> 06:50.208
But I will take ownership
in not being there for you

06:50.277 --> 06:52.177
when you and Juelz
were broken up,

06:52.246 --> 06:56.148
and that was because
I was-- I was always
in the middle,

06:56.216 --> 06:59.284
and I just wanted a break,
but I will own that

06:59.353 --> 07:04.189
I abandoned our friendship
because I was selfish.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.691
I can only respect
everything that
you're saying.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.560
These are things
that I've-- I've been

07:08.629 --> 07:11.296
waiting to kind of
see and hear.

07:11.365 --> 07:14.166
That break to me
was like,

07:14.234 --> 07:16.535
"Yo, where's my friend
when I need her?"

07:16.603 --> 07:19.704
And that hurt me, yo.
Hurt-- hurt me.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.773
So, yes, all this
other bull(bleep),

07:21.842 --> 07:23.041
you know
what I'm saying,

07:23.110 --> 07:25.677
is just all these
things conjured up

07:25.746 --> 07:28.280
because I'm angry
or upset at you.

07:28.348 --> 07:31.116
And I have held
grudges against you,

07:31.185 --> 07:33.418
and I wanna
release them here

07:33.487 --> 07:35.821
and see what
happens from there.

07:35.889 --> 07:38.590
But I do wanna
apologize to you.

07:38.659 --> 07:41.593
And-- And you have been
a good friend to me.

07:41.662 --> 07:45.363
Come.
Aww!

07:45.432 --> 07:47.599
That's
so beautiful!

07:47.668 --> 07:49.935
(Kimbella)
It feels good
to hear Yandy admit

07:50.003 --> 07:51.837
that she was
not there for me.

07:51.905 --> 07:55.841
This whole little Mendeecees
baby mama birthday incident

07:55.909 --> 07:59.711
got out of control,
and I'm ready
to put it behind me.

07:59.780 --> 08:03.248
Burning grudges isn't gonna
fix everything immediately,

08:03.317 --> 08:06.051
but it is a start
in the right direction.

08:06.119 --> 08:10.222
So, I wrote fear, doubt
and chocolate glazed donuts.

08:10.290 --> 08:13.592
(laughing)
Because fear and doubt

08:13.660 --> 08:15.193
can completely
take over you,

08:15.262 --> 08:17.696
and it could just--
it could stop you
from doing everything

08:17.764 --> 08:19.998
that you want to do,
and I really want
to chase my dreams.

08:20.067 --> 08:23.568
And my dreams are big,
and I don't wanna be
afraid of them.

08:23.637 --> 08:25.337
And then, you know,
the chocolate glazed donuts,

08:25.405 --> 08:27.205
like, after giving birth,
like, that's all

08:27.274 --> 08:28.640
I've been eating.

08:28.709 --> 08:32.677
And my diabetes is gonna
be crazy if I keep going.

08:32.746 --> 08:34.346
Okay, we're burning.

08:34.414 --> 08:37.415
(applause)
Burn, bitch.

08:37.484 --> 08:39.651
I'll go next.

08:39.720 --> 08:42.220
Um, you know,
the first thing
that I wrote down here

08:42.289 --> 08:46.525
was-- was-- was shame.

08:46.593 --> 08:51.229
So ashamed at my behavior
the other night.

08:51.298 --> 08:54.566
And I need to take
ownership of that.

08:54.635 --> 08:57.335
I apologize
for that night.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.437
(Joe)
I should've
never blown up on Cyn.

08:59.506 --> 09:01.506
Regardless
of what I thought

09:01.575 --> 09:03.174
was happening
in that moment,

09:03.243 --> 09:05.911
I don't think it's ever
Cyn's intention to hurt me,

09:05.979 --> 09:07.579
but I think because of
some of the issues

09:07.648 --> 09:09.548
that we've been having
prior to,

09:09.616 --> 09:12.617
our communication is just
not where it needs to be.

09:12.686 --> 09:14.419
And I'm gonna take
responsibility

09:14.488 --> 09:15.820

The attraction

22:55.742 --> 22:58.109
to the nightlife
in New York City

22:58.177 --> 23:00.745
is not the strippers,
it's the actual bartenders.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.246
You know, the whole culture,
right?

23:02.315 --> 23:03.381

over a year now.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.454
It's called
"A Dollar at a Time."

23:10.523 --> 23:13.057
It look like Maino might have
took a page out of my book.

23:30.443 --> 23:31.909
I didn't... I didn't
congratulate you, man.

23:31.978 --> 23:33.110
Hey, man.
Congrats, man.

23:33.179 --> 23:35.146
Thank you.
Everybody is doing it,
though.

23:35.214 --> 23:38.682
Like, uh, Safaree.

23:38.751 --> 23:41.285
Safaree went and he proposed to
your old flame, didn't he?

23:41.354 --> 23:44.789
(Rich)
I'd known about Erica
and Safaree dating already.

23:44.857 --> 23:47.224
If they're happy,
I'm happy for them.

23:47.293 --> 23:49.827
The only issue I've ever had was
that I've asked Safaree

23:49.896 --> 23:52.163
on multiple occasions if,
in fact, him and Erica

23:52.231 --> 23:54.432
were dealing together,
and he told me no.

23:54.500 --> 23:57.368
I've come to realize that
Safaree really isn't my friend.

23:57.437 --> 24:01.672
I feel like if I ask you
a (bleep) question,

24:01.741 --> 24:05.075
"Yo, I hear you dating E."
"Nah, I don't (bleep) with her."

24:05.144 --> 24:10.214
Oh. So you saying
he lied to you.
For months.

24:10.283 --> 24:12.216
That-- that--
I'm shutting up.

24:12.285 --> 24:14.919
Yo, just keep it a book.
I feel a way,

24:14.987 --> 24:17.888
because you been
in my presence but
you hiding (bleep).

24:17.957 --> 24:19.824
It's just not E.
I'm with you.

24:19.892 --> 24:22.092
This has zero to do
with Erica Mena.

24:22.161 --> 24:23.594
That's what I said
to him in Costa Rica.

24:23.663 --> 24:26.630
So, obviously
I wasn't in Costa Rica,
so you need to catch me up.

24:26.699 --> 24:30.935
Before we got to Costa Rica,
I called him personally

24:31.003 --> 24:34.872
and I say, "Yo, I'm
seeing what's going on
and we got this trip coming.

24:34.941 --> 24:37.441
"What do you have planned?
Like, hip me to the game.

24:37.510 --> 24:39.710
"Are you flying Erica out?
Are y'all about to do
your own thing?

24:39.779 --> 24:42.746
Just tell me so I know
how to move."
Mm-hmm.

24:42.815 --> 24:44.915
And he put the
emphatic sauce on it.

24:44.984 --> 24:47.785
"No. I would never
bring shawty with me.

24:47.854 --> 24:50.354
"I haven't spoken to
Erica in a million years.

24:50.423 --> 24:54.425
She be on me, but..."
You know, he put that
type of sauce on it,

24:54.494 --> 24:57.428
so that morning, once
it was confirmed that
she was there,

24:57.497 --> 25:00.931
I had smoke coming
from my head.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.201
I did invite him to...
to come to the studio.
You invited him?

25:04.270 --> 25:06.337
Yeah, I invited him
to come to the screening
for this documentary.

25:06.405 --> 25:08.339
Y'all talk?
I mean, we...

25:08.407 --> 25:10.441
That's you man?
It's not even that.

25:10.510 --> 25:12.042
Like, I'm cool
and he's all right.

25:12.111 --> 25:14.545

He's all right.
The guy's all right.

25:14.614 --> 25:17.781

support what you do.

You all gonna have
a conversation about it.

I don't have that much
expectations of a lot
of these dudes.

25:26.559 --> 25:30.127
I'm not running around,
thinking Safaree is
my friend to begin with.

25:30.196 --> 25:33.464
I'm not expecting dudes
to keep it real if that's not
how they live they life.

25:33.533 --> 25:38.802

about it was funny to me.

out there, so...
