WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.968
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:13.304 --> 00:15.598
Hyakkao Private Academy.

00:16.933 --> 00:19.102
About to celebrate its 122nd anniversary,

00:19.185 --> 00:21.604
this school prides itself
on tradition and prestige.

00:40.540 --> 00:42.709
Showdown! Full house!

00:45.336 --> 00:46.504
Too bad!

00:46.588 --> 00:49.299
You get an A for effort!

00:50.550 --> 00:53.470
A royal straight flush?

00:57.390 --> 01:00.852
Now, now,
I'm sure it will be an ordeal for you.

01:01.352 --> 01:03.480
But make sure you do your best.

01:04.397 --> 01:06.316
Fido.

01:07.150 --> 01:12.530
That day, I ceased being a human.
Those are the rules of this school.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.658
It's all about money here.

01:17.744 --> 01:21.289
That and how good a gambler you are.

01:33.593 --> 01:34.761
There! A straight!

01:36.054 --> 01:37.806
You win again, Mary?

01:37.889 --> 01:40.683
That's our Mary, a juggernaut!

01:43.269 --> 01:46.189
Not that I have my A-game today, you know.

01:50.652 --> 01:51.653
I'm just...

01:51.736 --> 01:52.904
BOTTOM-FEEDER, RANK #0100 FIDO

01:52.987 --> 01:53.905
...a house pet.

01:55.031 --> 01:58.368
Once you plunge to these depths,
you can never climb up again.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.370
Or so I thought.

02:04.332 --> 02:05.750
Until she arrived.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.558
A GIRL NAMED YUMEKO JABAMI

03:45.642 --> 03:50.104
As I informed you last week, today,
I'll be introducing a transfer student.

03:57.862 --> 04:01.491
Hello, everybody.
My name is Yumeko Jabami.

04:02.242 --> 04:06.788
Inept as I am, I hope you'll welcome me
as a member of your class.

04:07.789 --> 04:09.707
- She's pretty hot.
- Totally my type.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.210
Yumeko? That sure is a strange name.

04:16.339 --> 04:20.760
I'd like one of you to show Yumeko
around the school grounds.

04:21.344 --> 04:25.723
Ryota, aren't you class president?
Would you mind doing the honors?

04:26.307 --> 04:28.851
- Sure.
- Ryota.

04:28.935 --> 04:30.937
Thank you in advance.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.522
Thank you.

04:33.856 --> 04:37.277
For the first time,
I'm glad that I became a Fido.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.327
Oh, my! How lovely!

04:49.122 --> 04:54.085
This certainly is a splendid academy.
I'm so glad that I transferred here.

05:01.342 --> 05:02.969
What is this?

05:08.182 --> 05:09.642
Jabami.

05:10.226 --> 05:12.228
Yes, what is it?

05:13.271 --> 05:17.608
Listen, you know how to gamble?

05:18.318 --> 05:20.278
Gamble, did you say?

05:21.112 --> 05:25.408
Well, poker and mah-jongg, and such...
I am familiar with the rules, at least.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.618
I see. Right.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.914
See, at this academy,
gambling's always been all the rage.

05:32.707 --> 05:35.710
Once classes end, you'll see
gambling going on everywhere.

05:36.377 --> 05:39.630
And since there are a lot
of rich students here,

05:39.714 --> 05:41.215
the stakes are ridiculously high.

05:42.383 --> 05:45.803
I'm sure you'll get asked sooner or later,
so better watch your--

05:48.014 --> 05:52.226
Well, well. That's certainly something
to look forward to.

05:58.316 --> 06:00.943
Jabami! Welcome to Year Two, Flower Class!

06:01.027 --> 06:02.695
Which school did you transfer from?

06:02.779 --> 06:04.947
- Any hobbies?
- What do you do on days off?

06:05.031 --> 06:06.699
- Have a boyfriend?
- Let's be friends!

06:06.783 --> 06:10.912
Oh, yes, I hope we can be friends, too.

06:13.873 --> 06:18.086
Nice to meet you! I'm Mary Mary.
I hope we can be friends!

06:18.169 --> 06:20.880
I hope we can be friends, too, Mary.

06:21.464 --> 06:25.885
Are you free after this, Jabami?
Would you like to gamble with me?

06:32.100 --> 06:33.184
Hey, what?

06:33.267 --> 06:37.814
- Mary's gonna gamble with the new girl!
- Think she's gonna pull that one?

06:41.901 --> 06:45.780
- What kind of gambling you have in mind?
- It's called Ballot Rock-Paper-Scissors,

06:45.863 --> 06:48.074
a gambling game that our class devised.

06:48.783 --> 06:54.080
First, everyone in our class draws either
a rock, scissors or paper on a card.

06:54.163 --> 06:58.126
Then they drop those cards into the box
so we can't see them.

06:58.668 --> 07:02.171
We both draw three cards
from the box, choose just one,

07:02.255 --> 07:04.048
and play Rock-Paper-Scissors.

07:04.757 --> 07:09.095
If it's a stalemate, we draw from
the remaining two cards and play again.

07:09.178 --> 07:13.182
If it's a stalemate all three times,
it's a draw. That makes up one game.

07:13.766 --> 07:17.562
Unlike normal Rock-Paper-Scissors,
you don't always show your entire hand.

07:17.645 --> 07:20.690
Trying to read each other under
such unfair circumstances is the appeal.

07:20.773 --> 07:23.693
Sounds fun! I'd love to try it.

07:23.776 --> 07:26.487
Okay! That's what I like to hear.

07:27.071 --> 07:28.239
Jabami--

07:29.031 --> 07:31.284
Fido, fetch the chips.

07:34.787 --> 07:36.038
I said fetch.

07:36.956 --> 07:37.832
Yes, ma'am.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.629
These are the chips.

07:43.713 --> 07:48.426
The rate is 10,000 yen per chip.
For starters, here are 120 of them.

07:49.010 --> 07:52.180
I'll let you determine
how much we bet each game.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.432
You never know till you try.

07:55.141 --> 07:57.393
- How many are we betting?
- Let's see.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.646
Then, two chips.

08:02.231 --> 08:06.486
In this form of gambling, you almost
never end up with all three choices.

08:07.195 --> 08:10.907
Since you're only drawing three, you're
more likely to get more of the same cards,

08:10.990 --> 08:12.783
like two rocks and one scissors.

08:13.493 --> 08:18.372
If your hand contains lots of rocks,
odds are the pool is full of rocks.

08:18.998 --> 08:22.502
Meaning that since your opponent
is apt to throw out a rock,

08:22.585 --> 08:23.920
you should throw out paper.

08:24.003 --> 08:27.048
Basically, you're betting that you can
read each other amid such uncertainty.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.718
Ready? At the signal,
play your card when I do.

08:30.801 --> 08:33.137
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Rock, paper, scissors!

08:35.097 --> 08:38.017
So you win the first match, Jabami.
Congratulations.

08:38.100 --> 08:41.521
Thank you very much.
I'm going to take two chips, then.

08:41.604 --> 08:45.274
Now, you understand how this game
works, right? Let's keep rolling.

08:45.358 --> 08:49.654
Yes. All right, this time,
let's go with 50 chips.

08:50.738 --> 08:53.491
Fifty chips? That's 500,000 yen.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.993
How can you just...?

08:57.912 --> 09:00.498
I didn't think you were such a risk-taker.

09:00.581 --> 09:01.582
Oh, no.

09:05.962 --> 09:09.173
Fifty-thousand yen's on the line
over one game of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

09:10.841 --> 09:12.260
Are you ready now?

09:12.343 --> 09:15.179
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Rock, paper, scissors!

09:15.763 --> 09:17.515
Well, a draw, eh?

09:17.598 --> 09:20.893
Let's do it again. We have a...

09:20.977 --> 09:22.353
- Tie!
- Tie!

09:22.937 --> 09:25.565
All right! I win!

09:26.148 --> 09:29.569
Oh, my.
Either way, I would've lost, right?

09:31.028 --> 09:33.739
Good thing I won
when the stakes were high.

09:34.240 --> 09:38.744
- How many are we betting next?
- All right, two chips.

09:43.332 --> 09:44.750
Okay, let's go.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.378
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Rock, paper, scissors!

09:48.713 --> 09:51.173
Congratulations! You win, Jabami.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.384
What next?

09:54.218 --> 09:55.469
Let's see.

09:59.223 --> 10:02.143
Shall we go with 50 chips once more?

10:02.226 --> 10:05.146
Are you kidding me?
Didn't you get burned enough?

10:06.772 --> 10:07.857
Interesting.

10:09.233 --> 10:11.152
I like that kind of spirit.

10:15.239 --> 10:16.282
Here we go.

10:16.824 --> 10:18.784
- Rock, paper, scissors!
- Rock, paper, scissors!

10:21.078 --> 10:22.622
Great minds do think alike.

10:23.539 --> 10:25.124
Here we go again.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.128
We have a...

10:29.211 --> 10:30.129
- Tie!
- Tie!

10:37.720 --> 10:40.556
Yes! I win yet again!

10:40.640 --> 10:43.434
Thanks for the 500,000.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.771
That's one million yen, total.

10:46.854 --> 10:49.273
All right, next!
Let's keep rolling, shall we?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.276
Is something wrong?

10:52.860 --> 10:55.279
Don't tell me you're getting cold feet.

10:55.363 --> 10:59.367
Well, after losing one million yen,
who can blame you?

11:01.369 --> 11:04.288
No, the showdown
is just about to start.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.999
Please bet two chips this time around.

11:09.418 --> 11:14.256
It's over. 216 chips versus 24 chips.
The gap is way too huge.

11:14.840 --> 11:16.092
Her back's up against the wall.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.260
She'll never pull off an upset
if she's freaked out.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.430
Then let's carry on.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.475
Rock, paper, scissors!

11:24.558 --> 11:25.393
Scissors!

11:25.476 --> 11:26.769
Scissors!

11:29.146 --> 11:33.317
Oh, my, Jabami.
I see you've run out of chips.

11:33.401 --> 11:36.779
- Did she just lose 1.2 million yen?
- That was a huge gamble.

11:36.862 --> 11:40.658
Mary, would you mind playing
just one more game?

11:41.617 --> 11:43.285
Don't do it, Jabami!

11:43.369 --> 11:47.039
At the rate you're going,
you'll be a house pet on your first day.

11:47.123 --> 11:50.042
Of course!
How much do you want to bet?

11:50.751 --> 11:54.046
Idiot. You'll only get yourself mired
with no way out.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.801
Ten million yen in cash.

12:03.389 --> 12:07.143
Why would you walk around
with that amount of cash?

12:08.769 --> 12:10.354
Don't be ridiculous!

12:10.438 --> 12:14.358
Staking ten million yen on a single
casual game of Rock-Paper-Scissors.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.818
You...

12:17.361 --> 12:18.446
You're insane!

12:18.529 --> 12:24.201
Isn't that what makes it fun? Insanity
is the essence of gambling, right?

12:24.785 --> 12:28.205
In a capitalistic society,
money and life are the same.

12:28.789 --> 12:33.210
Trusting your life to fortune,
no one in their right mind would do that.

12:33.794 --> 12:37.089
And yet, people still throng casinos
because people derive pleasure

12:37.173 --> 12:40.468
from the insanity of risking their lives.

12:41.927 --> 12:46.015
In that case, the more insane you are,
the more you enjoy gambling!

12:47.183 --> 12:50.853
Now, then,
let's get our gambling freak on.

13:02.531 --> 13:06.452
President, this is the transfer student
who joined Year Two, Flower Class today.

13:09.413 --> 13:13.751
I see. So it looks like a viper
has appeared in my paradise.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.883
That's absurd! I won't be a party to this!

13:20.966 --> 13:24.261
Don't tell me you're getting cold feet.

13:29.391 --> 13:33.145
You stupid daughter of a rich boy!
Underestimating me!

13:34.522 --> 13:35.606
What's going on?

13:36.440 --> 13:40.027
Taking part in this insane gambling game
so soon after transferring here.

13:40.110 --> 13:42.530
How can you be so calm about it?

13:45.032 --> 13:47.826
These large wagers do make my heart race.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.496
Damn. Acting so nonchalant.

13:50.579 --> 13:53.332
We're talking ten million yen.
Don't you get that?

13:54.166 --> 13:57.711
Well, who cares? I'm going to win anyway.

13:58.295 --> 14:02.925
After all, of the 30 voters,
up to 21 will vote in my favor!

14:03.008 --> 14:09.348
Whether it's their debt I'm covering
or their standing in the classroom.

14:09.431 --> 14:10.933
There are all sorts of reasons,

14:11.016 --> 14:16.355
but at any rate, my 21 slaves will vote
the way I want them to every time.

14:16.939 --> 14:18.899
This time, it's rock and paper.

14:18.983 --> 14:22.361
Meaning that as far as odds go,
this is what it looks like inside.

14:23.445 --> 14:25.197
There are hardly any scissors.

14:25.281 --> 14:29.076
Even if Yumeko were to draw scissors,
the odds are even less she'd throw it.

14:29.159 --> 14:33.205
In other words, as long
as I throw out paper, I'll never lose.

14:33.831 --> 14:38.377
The only thing I have to worry about
is not drawing paper myself.

14:39.086 --> 14:42.339
Two papers!
It doesn't get better than that!

14:42.423 --> 14:45.134
I win! You're going down now!

14:45.718 --> 14:48.137
Have you decided your move? Ready?

14:51.223 --> 14:55.811
What's wrong? You only have three cards.
So, what good will it do to hesitate?

14:55.895 --> 14:58.147
Did you think I wouldn't catch on?

14:58.731 --> 15:02.151
Everyone is collaborating with you,
isn't that right, Mary?

15:04.278 --> 15:09.909
Judging by all of the voting till now,
I wouldn't say all, but ten, perhaps?

15:09.992 --> 15:12.661
To seal your victory,
maybe 20 or so, should I say?

15:12.745 --> 15:16.040
- On what basis are you--?
- Your methods are crude.

15:16.498 --> 15:21.420
You made the same play twice in a row
when there was 500,000 yen on the line.

15:21.503 --> 15:23.714
Why wouldn't I suspect
something was going on?

15:24.632 --> 15:28.218
Whenever the stakes were low,
you'd throw in some random moves,

15:28.302 --> 15:31.221
but as camouflage, that was a poor tactic.

15:31.305 --> 15:35.100
You'll never deceive anyone
unless you're prepared to shed blood!

15:35.184 --> 15:37.561
Would you stop making
these false accusations?

15:37.645 --> 15:39.813
You're trying to sweep
this match under the rug--

15:39.897 --> 15:43.484
Heavens, no!
No, why would I let it all go to waste?

15:43.567 --> 15:47.112
After all,
the real fun is just about to start.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.491
How on earth can she be so relaxed?

15:50.574 --> 15:53.494
Don't tell me she's convinced
she can beat me.

15:53.577 --> 15:58.415
There's just no way. As long as she
doesn't know what I'm going to throw,

15:58.499 --> 16:00.918
she can't possibly believe
that she'll win.

16:01.001 --> 16:02.503
This is just a bluff.

16:03.087 --> 16:05.506
I'm going to throw out paper and win!

16:05.589 --> 16:09.510
Are you done with your tedious drivel?
Hurry up and pick out a card!

16:12.096 --> 16:14.139
I did warn you, all right?

16:15.349 --> 16:16.517
Are you ready?

16:18.102 --> 16:18.936
Yes.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.738
Showdown!

16:30.322 --> 16:31.865
Rock, paper,

16:32.324 --> 16:36.537
scissors!

16:38.330 --> 16:39.164
Scissors.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.546
What? Scissors?

16:53.053 --> 16:54.263
Impossible.

16:55.139 --> 16:56.140
No way.

16:57.808 --> 17:01.603
Impossible or not,
please don't avert your eyes from reality.

17:02.229 --> 17:03.814
Now, as for settling up...

17:03.897 --> 17:07.609
after subtracting what I lost,
that will be 8.8 million yen.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.695
Your payment will be appreciated.

17:09.778 --> 17:11.530
How did this happen, anyway?

17:12.114 --> 17:15.743
Just saddling her with a little debt,
that was all I wanted.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.663
So how did I lose 8.8 million
to her instead?

17:20.205 --> 17:21.457
Why the hell...?

17:21.540 --> 17:25.627
- Who the hell is this girl?
- You'll be kind enough to pay up, right?

17:29.715 --> 17:32.134
I can't.

17:32.217 --> 17:33.469
What was that?

17:38.557 --> 17:40.768
I don't have it right now.

17:41.435 --> 17:44.480
Could you possibly wait
a few days, please?

17:48.317 --> 17:49.485
Mary.

18:02.664 --> 18:08.504
I had a wonderful time, so fine by me.
Now, then, everyone, good afternoon!

18:08.962 --> 18:12.591
Starting tomorrow, I hope you'll
welcome me as a member of your class.

18:22.309 --> 18:23.143
Jabami!

18:25.104 --> 18:28.232
Ryota? Is there something
I can do for you?

18:28.690 --> 18:29.525
Well...

18:30.192 --> 18:36.907
Well, I've got to ask you.
How did you know she was fixing the game?

18:36.990 --> 18:39.493
Oh, that was quite simple.

18:39.576 --> 18:43.831
It was obvious to me right away
that Mary was manipulating the voting.

18:43.997 --> 18:49.086
And so I had to find out which card
was being voted on the most.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.922
Right. But how'd you do that?

18:52.005 --> 18:56.426
Let's just say that there were 20 people
in league with Mary.

18:57.219 --> 19:01.682
Unless those 20 shared which card they
were voting on, it wouldn't be cheating.

19:02.224 --> 19:06.770
As far as I could tell, there wasn't
a pattern to what card was being voted on.

19:06.854 --> 19:10.858
That said, it would've been too hard
to memorize the order ahead of time.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.943
Therefore, one could deduce

19:13.026 --> 19:16.989
that she was picking a card to throw out
on a match-by-match basis.

19:17.072 --> 19:22.661
If so, then how? I was observing her
right up until I ran out of chips,

19:22.744 --> 19:26.039
but Mary never seemed to make
any kind of signal.

19:26.790 --> 19:31.211
Then what about audio cues?
No, I didn't hear anything, either.

19:31.670 --> 19:34.673
And so that left
just one last possibility.

19:35.424 --> 19:40.012
Somebody in the classroom was signaling
in Mary's place.

19:40.095 --> 19:43.432
If this notion was correct,
it had to be someone specific,

19:43.515 --> 19:45.017
who would draw everyone's attention.

19:45.225 --> 19:48.187
As I continued to observe, it hit me.

19:49.062 --> 19:52.441
All eyes would be on me
because I was one of the gamblers.

19:52.524 --> 19:55.194
That was the flaw in my logic.

19:55.277 --> 19:57.696
Their eyes weren't on me,

19:57.779 --> 20:02.159
they were actually on the person
right behind me.

20:05.495 --> 20:08.874
- So you had that part figured out, too.
- The rest was easy.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.376
I guessed your signals from your demeanor.

20:11.460 --> 20:13.879
My demeanor? Even though I was behind you?

20:13.962 --> 20:18.884
Yes. After all,
a girl can't do without her hand mirror!

20:18.967 --> 20:20.052
Is that right?

20:23.555 --> 20:25.807
Would you mind explaining one more thing?

20:25.891 --> 20:30.646
How were you able to draw scissors
at the end? The odds were pretty low.

20:30.729 --> 20:33.982
Oh, that was pure coincidence.

20:34.691 --> 20:35.901
That was certainly lucky.

20:35.984 --> 20:37.945
You're kidding, right?

20:38.028 --> 20:41.365
You burned through 1.2 million yen
to uncover her cheating.

20:41.907 --> 20:46.078
And yet, you're saying you bet
ten million yen on a mere coincidence?

20:47.704 --> 20:49.081
Yes. Well...

20:49.665 --> 20:52.209
If you'd kept quiet
about seeing through her con,

20:52.292 --> 20:55.003
you could've played to a draw at worst.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.965
By drawing scissors,
you'd more or less have won.

20:58.799 --> 21:04.054
So you went out of your way to tell her
because you relish taking risks?

21:04.846 --> 21:06.473
Oh, my, please.

21:06.556 --> 21:09.893
Even I find it tedious
to merely assume risk.

21:10.352 --> 21:13.272
But having too great an advantage
would be boring, right?

21:14.940 --> 21:17.109
You really are something else.

21:17.192 --> 21:20.487
I'll never be able to feel that way,
as long as I live.

21:21.738 --> 21:23.282
- I'm leaving the academy.
- What?

21:24.199 --> 21:27.911
I have all this debt.
I owe Mary Mary five million yen.

21:27.995 --> 21:31.290
When I tried to pay it off by gambling,
my debt only ballooned.

21:32.374 --> 21:36.420
It felt like I was swimming in a swamp.
I'm exhausted.

21:37.254 --> 21:40.424
If only I were as good as you,
things might've been different.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.469
Jabami, I'm really sorry.

21:52.060 --> 21:54.313
Come to think of it, I never thanked you.

21:55.147 --> 21:58.066
- Take this, please.
- No.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.569
I enjoyed a lovely gambling session today.

22:01.236 --> 22:04.072
This is a small token of my gratitude.
Please accept it.

22:05.324 --> 22:09.286
Hold up! No.
I took part in the cheating, and I--

22:09.369 --> 22:13.999
I dislike both contests that I'm sure
to win and that I'm sure to lose.

22:14.416 --> 22:16.626
Because neither of them are gambling.

22:17.210 --> 22:21.590
Today, I was able to engage in some
stimulating gambling, thanks to you.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.508
Thank you very much!

22:24.509 --> 22:28.013
I couldn't see any trace of a shadow
in that smile.

22:28.555 --> 22:31.099
No resentment
or pity towards me whatsoever.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.436
I enjoyed today's gambling
from the bottom of my heart.

22:35.020 --> 22:37.606
And so I thank you. That was all.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.108
She's not normal.

22:42.444 --> 22:43.779
A gambling freak.

22:44.905 --> 22:45.906
A compulsive gambler!

24:19.541 --> 24:22.127
I ended up like this
because I lost to you!

24:22.210 --> 24:25.338
Yumeko- senpai,
I'll lend you 20 million yen!

24:25.422 --> 24:29.676
- All you have to do is nod yes!
- Intriguing. Why don't we meddle?

24:29.759 --> 24:30.969
