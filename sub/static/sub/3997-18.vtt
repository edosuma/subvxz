00:02.051 --> 00:03.484
This month marks Nick and my

00:03.552 --> 00:05.519
ten year anniversary
of living together.

00:05.620 --> 00:07.521
Our "tin" anniversary.

00:07.539 --> 00:08.772
Ten years?
You guys are like

00:08.840 --> 00:10.107
- Bert and Ernie.
- I got dibs on Bert.

00:10.175 --> 00:11.475
- Dibs on Ernie.
- Nice.

00:11.543 --> 00:12.643
- Cool, man. All right.
- Yeah, man.

00:12.710 --> 00:14.312
Now, obviously,

00:14.379 --> 00:15.212
we're going to have
an anniversary party.

00:15.280 --> 00:16.680
You guys are invited.

00:16.748 --> 00:18.082
I'm not sure if
I'm coming to that, man.

00:18.150 --> 00:19.616
Remember the "wood" anniversary?

00:19.684 --> 00:20.683
Ah!

00:20.751 --> 00:21.751
You cut me!

00:21.819 --> 00:22.919
Well, happy
anniversary!

00:22.987 --> 00:23.947
I gotta get
a tourniquet.

00:23.955 --> 00:25.036
Hold some more wood for me.

00:26.089 --> 00:27.123
Yeah!

00:27.191 --> 00:28.491
Well, it wasn't
as bad as paper.

00:31.227 --> 00:33.063
Happy anniversary!

00:33.130 --> 00:34.164
Paper!

00:34.231 --> 00:35.731
Party time, man.

00:35.799 --> 00:37.099
Did you know that

00:37.167 --> 00:40.336
the chemical symbol
for tin is SN?

00:40.403 --> 00:42.371
- Schmidt and Nick.
- What?

00:42.439 --> 00:44.340
Is no one else's mind blown
by this?

00:44.407 --> 00:46.041
That's it,
our theme is TinFinity.

00:46.109 --> 00:48.777
TinFinity. That's actually
really good, Schmidt.

00:48.845 --> 00:51.213
- Yeah, it is.
- I really don't think two men who

00:51.281 --> 00:52.580
live together for
ten years need a party.

00:52.647 --> 00:54.815
Why must you always
be like this?

00:54.883 --> 00:56.451
Because you never let me
participate in the planning.

00:56.518 --> 00:58.686
I would love for you
to participate.

00:58.753 --> 01:01.222
Gah! That was a trick.
I was trying to get out of it.

ten years of
living together?

01:11.632 --> 01:12.866
Why are we friends with
these guys, Jess?

01:12.933 --> 01:13.766
- I...
- What happened?

01:13.834 --> 01:15.402
It's so weird to think

01:15.470 --> 01:17.604
that Nick is the last person
I kissed.

01:18.171 --> 01:19.239
Actually, Schmidt's

01:19.307 --> 01:20.747
- the last person I kissed.
- Okay, what?

01:20.774 --> 01:22.709
It was nothing.
Nick was watching.

01:22.776 --> 01:24.676
What is happening
in this loft?

01:24.744 --> 01:26.545
Ooh, girls chatting.

01:26.613 --> 01:28.214
Hey, Nick.

01:28.281 --> 01:29.581
I wish I knew what
was going on

01:29.649 --> 01:30.616
inside Nick's head.

01:30.683 --> 01:33.152
He's this, like,
grumpy mystery.

01:33.220 --> 01:34.520
Jess, are these
open for anybody?

01:34.587 --> 01:35.954
- Yep.
- Right on, thank you.

01:36.023 --> 01:37.656
He can't communicate
a feeling to save his life.

01:38.224 --> 01:39.591
But why can't I
stop thinking

01:39.659 --> 01:41.993
about his mouth on my mouth?

01:42.061 --> 01:43.228
Hey, Jess,

01:43.295 --> 01:44.662
do I have frosting on my lips?

01:46.698 --> 01:48.900
Look at my mouth--
do I have frosting on it?

01:48.967 --> 01:50.601
Wh-Why are you asking me this?

01:50.669 --> 01:51.702
My mouth feels moist and weird.

01:51.770 --> 01:53.104
Do I have anything on it?

01:53.172 --> 01:55.706
Get out of here!
Ugh! Aw...

01:55.774 --> 01:57.374
Okay, you know what?

01:57.442 --> 01:59.176
You need what I needed.
You need

01:59.244 --> 02:00.544
a new guy, all right?

02:00.611 --> 02:02.112
Dating Shivrang helped me

02:02.180 --> 02:03.447
get past all
the weird stuff with Schmidt.

02:03.515 --> 02:04.714
I need the Anti-Nick.

02:04.782 --> 02:05.416
- Yeah.
- I need

02:05.483 --> 02:06.550
a real man, who can

02:06.617 --> 02:07.651
express his feelings,
and I need

02:07.718 --> 02:10.120
a different mouth
on my mouth.

02:10.187 --> 02:11.755
To erase that mouth.

02:11.822 --> 02:12.755
<i>No, you actually</i>

02:12.822 --> 02:14.323
don't need to
wash raw denim.

02:14.391 --> 02:15.724
Haven't washed my
pants in 18 months.

02:16.760 --> 02:19.695
Also, I'm bisexual.

02:19.763 --> 02:21.697
Microchips be
gettin' small.

02:21.765 --> 02:23.566
They be, like,
blueberry size.

02:23.633 --> 02:25.634
So you could put 'em
in your cereal, girl.

02:25.702 --> 02:27.670
I don't get your thing.

02:28.737 --> 02:29.571
It's prescription.

02:31.273 --> 02:32.107
Damn it.

02:32.425 --> 02:34.426
What happened to the
guys in this bar?

02:34.493 --> 02:36.093
They open up a bus
station next door?

02:36.161 --> 02:37.228
Where are
the real men?

02:37.296 --> 02:38.863
I can't talk right now.

02:38.931 --> 02:40.931
I'm writing a strongly-worded
e-mail to my florist.

02:43.135 --> 02:44.435
Guys, guys,
guys, guys, guys,

02:44.502 --> 02:45.969
guys, guys, look at the door,
don't look at the door,

02:46.037 --> 02:47.304
look right now, don't look,
one at a time,

02:47.372 --> 02:49.773
look, but don't look.
Guys, one at a time.

02:49.841 --> 02:51.007
Don't look now.

02:51.075 --> 02:52.876
Look. No, you're
both looking.

02:52.944 --> 02:53.944
- I don't know what to do.
- I'm confused.

02:54.011 --> 02:55.479
Look right now at the door. Go.

02:56.247 --> 02:57.147
Oh...

02:57.215 --> 02:58.716
that is a strapping
young man.

02:58.783 --> 03:00.850
That is Jax McTavish.

03:00.917 --> 03:02.418
He plays safety
for San Francisco.

03:02.486 --> 03:03.653
Why's he with Winston?

03:03.721 --> 03:05.388
Winston looks so cool.

03:05.456 --> 03:07.390
- What up, guys?
- Oh, "What's up, guys."

03:07.458 --> 03:08.758
You're just gonna walk over
and say, "What's up, guys?"

03:08.826 --> 03:10.626
Winston, does he think
you're Omar Epps?

03:10.694 --> 03:12.261
You guys talking about Jax?

03:12.329 --> 03:14.129
Look, I interviewed him
at the radio station,

03:14.197 --> 03:15.164
and we just
hit it off.

03:15.232 --> 03:16.298
It's not a big deal,
you know,

03:16.366 --> 03:17.265
unless you think hanging out

03:17.333 --> 03:18.467
with a pro baller is a big deal.

03:18.534 --> 03:20.702
His hands are so big and warm.

03:20.770 --> 03:23.004
I want to fall asleep in them,
like Thumbelina.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.373
How about, uh, introducing me?

03:26.576 --> 03:27.816
Yeah, okay.
You and Jax?

03:28.878 --> 03:29.811
Yeah.

03:29.879 --> 03:30.846
Jess and Jax McTavish.

03:30.913 --> 03:32.280
Great bit, Jess.

03:32.348 --> 03:34.548
What a dumb idea.

03:34.616 --> 03:36.149
- Do it.
- No.

03:36.217 --> 03:38.419
- You can't handle that kind of thunder.
- Hell, no.

03:38.487 --> 03:40.454
Jax and I
are just becoming friends.

03:40.522 --> 03:42.322
- I'm going over there.
- Jess, no, Jess.

03:42.391 --> 03:43.858
Guys...

03:43.925 --> 03:44.925
Hey, Jess, let me show
you something. Hmm?

03:44.993 --> 03:46.560
It's right here.

03:46.628 --> 03:48.068
Hi, I'm Jess.
I'm Winston's roommate.

03:48.096 --> 03:49.328
How you doing?

03:49.397 --> 03:50.997
- I'm Jax.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.504
Jess, stop it, stop it.

03:52.533 --> 03:55.268
- Cool, so I hear you play
for San Francisco.   - I do.

03:55.335 --> 03:56.870
7.8 tackles, man,
I can't believe

03:56.937 --> 03:58.371
you didn't go
to the Pro Bowl.

03:58.439 --> 03:59.873
Here's my question:

03:59.940 --> 04:01.908
What's a "point-eight" tackle?

04:01.975 --> 04:04.010
Did you know
I'm a teacher?

04:04.077 --> 04:05.377
What would you teach me?

04:05.445 --> 04:07.479
Nick... the theme is
"masculine garden party."

04:07.547 --> 04:08.747
Look at that--
I made a graph.

04:08.815 --> 04:10.015
I thought you said I was
gonna help you plan it.

04:10.082 --> 04:11.583
Nick, we both know that
you're not very good

04:11.651 --> 04:12.918
with party chores.

04:12.985 --> 04:14.385
You sent out the
invitations, right?

04:14.421 --> 04:16.755
Me?!

04:16.822 --> 04:18.123
I sent them out?

04:18.190 --> 04:20.190
Okay, I'm older now.
I am wiser.

04:20.259 --> 04:21.659
I want to help plan
my own party.

04:21.726 --> 04:23.661
Okay, fine, I will
give you balloons...

04:23.729 --> 04:24.829
Oh, sweet, balloons are...

04:24.897 --> 04:26.564
...and Porta Potties.
Porta Potties?!

04:26.632 --> 04:27.832
That sounds like a job
for babies.

04:27.900 --> 04:29.500
Does that look like
a job for babies?

04:30.068 --> 04:31.702
Oh, so this is a big job?

04:31.770 --> 04:33.450
- I thought you were being
disrespectful.    - No!

04:33.505 --> 04:35.873
- Oh. - Where do you think people
are gonna go to the bathroom?

04:35.941 --> 04:37.240
I never thought of that.

04:37.308 --> 04:38.909
And you are now
in charge of that,

04:38.976 --> 04:40.444
and if you dig a hole

04:40.511 --> 04:43.112
in a- in, in a dirt field,
I'm gonna kill you.

04:43.180 --> 04:46.513
I don't want
the responsibility.

04:47.318 --> 04:48.518
You can do this, man.

04:48.586 --> 04:50.454
What, what are
your chores?

04:50.521 --> 04:52.621
- Well, Porta Potties.
- Porta Potties.

04:52.689 --> 04:54.389
What's-- now, what is the
first chore that I gave you?

04:54.458 --> 04:55.579
I have absolutely no memory.

04:55.592 --> 04:56.759
Balloons!

04:57.527 --> 04:59.428
I'm having
an anxiety attack.

05:01.980 --> 05:04.360
Yes, Ma, yes, now,
look, I-have to go.

05:04.481 --> 05:07.117
It's two men celebrating living
together for ten years.

05:07.184 --> 05:08.885
Uh, no, they're not.

05:08.953 --> 05:11.087
No, I can tell you for a fact
that they're not.

05:11.155 --> 05:12.756
Okay, okay,
I'm hanging up.

05:13.423 --> 05:15.191
So, good news.

05:15.259 --> 05:17.293
Um, my mom spoke to
your mom last night,

05:17.361 --> 05:20.162
and they've given
us their blessings.

05:20.229 --> 05:22.164
So that means...

05:22.231 --> 05:23.999
Well, now that
the moms approve,

05:24.067 --> 05:25.834
when do you want
to do this thing?

05:26.902 --> 05:30.235
Is that a...
that a proposal?

05:30.273 --> 05:32.541
Oh, are, are you upset?
I'm sorry, I...

05:32.608 --> 05:33.929
It's just, with
arranged marriage,

05:33.976 --> 05:35.276
there isn't a
lot of romance.

05:35.343 --> 05:37.278
No, no, no, I'm s--
I'm sorry, actually.

05:37.345 --> 05:38.946
I think I'm just
a little taken aback

05:39.014 --> 05:41.382
by how quick
this all has been.

05:41.449 --> 05:43.017
I barely know you, and...

05:43.085 --> 05:45.386
I used to just think that
if I was being proposed to,

05:45.453 --> 05:47.321
I would notice
it was happening.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.756
But we're doing this thing?

05:49.824 --> 05:51.864
Maybe you could just stop
saying "doing this thing."

05:52.626 --> 05:53.760
Yup.

05:55.629 --> 05:57.130
Really did it.

05:57.198 --> 05:59.566
Beautiful job,
thank you so much, what a...

05:59.633 --> 06:02.102
This is amazing-- everything's
tin, you guys, everything.

06:04.604 --> 06:05.572
Hey, man.

06:05.639 --> 06:07.807
Rented out the whole park, so
take your soccer someplace else.

06:07.874 --> 06:09.508
Give us our ball back,
you douche.

06:09.576 --> 06:11.817
Hey, yeah, sure, no, I'll give
you your ball back. Great.

06:13.646 --> 06:16.979
Pure tin, pure tin.

06:19.519 --> 06:21.386
Take your football
back to Europe.

06:21.454 --> 06:24.787
- Really?   - Who's the douche
now, you douche "B"?

06:24.857 --> 06:27.258
I couldn't stop you from
inviting Jax to the party,

06:27.326 --> 06:29.393
but I can stop it
from going any further.

06:29.461 --> 06:31.129
I will not lose Jax
as a friend, okay?

06:31.197 --> 06:32.463
I might not have
any game,

06:32.531 --> 06:35.066
but, oh, my goodness,
can I take game away.

06:35.134 --> 06:37.235
I'm getting that mouth on my mouth,
and don't you try to stop me, you...

06:37.302 --> 06:39.870
Look, clearly I have the upper
hand when it comes to Jax.

06:39.938 --> 06:42.305
- Do you?   - Oh, I do, because
I know all about sports.

06:42.373 --> 06:44.541
Jess, you know
nothing about sports.

06:44.609 --> 06:46.710
Oh, what am I going to do?
I guess I'll just have to use

06:46.778 --> 06:51.111
my eyes, hair, boobs, legs,
and adorable personality.

06:52.784 --> 06:54.016
Fool.

06:54.084 --> 06:56.285
I got, like, three
of those things.

06:56.353 --> 06:57.920
These are amazing.

06:57.988 --> 06:59.088
You also got tablecloths?

06:59.156 --> 07:00.589
I feel so fancy.

07:00.657 --> 07:02.258
How much did you spend
on this, Schmidt?

07:02.325 --> 07:05.658
Ah, Nicholas, I have what's
called an income, you know.

07:06.530 --> 07:07.496
Well, you're not
the only one

07:07.564 --> 07:10.065
who spent a little
bit of money on this.

07:10.133 --> 07:12.367
- Okay.  - Check this out, Schmidt,
you're gonna freak out.

07:12.434 --> 07:14.669
Hey, I'm presenting,
I'm presenting it.

07:14.737 --> 07:16.004
And that ain't no rental.

07:16.672 --> 07:17.672
Get up here.

07:17.740 --> 07:19.941
This is owned and operated
by Mr. Nick Miller.

07:20.009 --> 07:21.143
Little help from Sid.

07:21.210 --> 07:22.377
You bought a Porta Potti?

07:22.444 --> 07:24.045
This one has warm
and cold water,

07:24.113 --> 07:25.780
real soap dispensers,
a fan.

07:25.847 --> 07:27.148
Too much.

07:27.215 --> 07:28.482
What's that?
That's garbage.

07:28.549 --> 07:30.284
Garbage-- that's what
the nursing home said

07:30.351 --> 07:31.919
about my mattress.
I'll take it.

07:31.987 --> 07:34.922
For 60 bucks, and they threw in
something called

07:34.990 --> 07:36.857
"septic enzymes," which I
don't know what that is,

07:36.925 --> 07:39.293
but you're not supposed to
get it in your eyes, for sure.

07:39.360 --> 07:41.295
I'm a small business owner.

07:41.362 --> 07:43.997
Why on earth
would you buy a...?

07:44.564 --> 07:46.232
You know what? Forget
about it, I'm proud of you.

07:46.300 --> 07:47.834
- Thank you, man. - I gave you a
chore and you came through.

07:47.902 --> 07:49.602
Yeah, now, look,
now we have two.

07:49.670 --> 07:51.037
- What do you mean we have two-- two of what?
- Two bathrooms.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.673
Yours and <i>El Baño Presidente.</i>

07:54.240 --> 07:55.241
That's a Porta Potti?

07:55.309 --> 07:56.642
Yeah, luxury toilet.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.510
I thought that was
the visitor's center.

07:58.577 --> 07:59.812
- Well...
- That's enormous.

07:59.879 --> 08:01.713
Why did you get that,
Schmidt?

08:02.481 --> 08:03.548
What, did you think
I was gonna screw up?

08:03.616 --> 08:05.517
No, come on, man, no.

08:05.584 --> 08:07.452
You know how our
relationship works.

08:07.520 --> 08:09.587
I'm over-responsible,
you're under-responsible.

08:09.655 --> 08:11.656
Here's the good news-- now
people have a backup to use...

08:11.724 --> 08:14.091
No, I want everyone to use this,
I want it to be the main potty.

08:14.159 --> 08:15.592
Oh, n-no, I don't think that
should be the main anything.

08:15.660 --> 08:17.061
I think people
would be better off

08:17.129 --> 08:18.529
if they just made a
caca in their hand.

08:18.596 --> 08:20.497
I don't think so;
Mine's better than that.

08:20.565 --> 08:22.366
- I'm sure you killed it on balloons.
- Well... if you let me explain

08:22.434 --> 08:23.701
- what happened with the balloons...
- Who needs balloons?

08:23.768 --> 08:25.436
I didn't want balloons anyway.

08:25.503 --> 08:26.804
This isn't a little
girl's birthday party.

08:26.872 --> 08:28.405
This is a celebration
of friendship.

08:28.473 --> 08:29.473
- Then, as a friend...
- Yeah.

08:29.474 --> 08:30.974
I want you
to get rid of that.

08:31.042 --> 08:32.409
- I want everybody using mine.
- You spit on the...

08:32.409 --> 08:34.811
- You brought a dirt dungeon to our TinFinity.
- All right, well, we'll see.

08:34.812 --> 08:36.046
I'm proud of you;
You did good.

08:36.113 --> 08:39.446
I'm proud of you.
You bought a spaceship.

08:40.083 --> 08:41.484
Hey, man, you
watch <i>Homeland?</i>

08:41.552 --> 08:43.385
No? I'm in the first
season, second episode.

08:43.453 --> 08:44.855
Don't spoil anything.

08:44.922 --> 08:46.088
Hey, flag on the play.

08:46.156 --> 08:47.156
Too many men
on the field.

08:47.224 --> 08:48.357
Winston, get out.

08:48.424 --> 08:50.359
Jax, over here
on the bench with me.

08:50.426 --> 08:52.066
- Come on, let me show you some stuff.
- Okay.

08:58.534 --> 09:00.002
Go, go, Jess, go.

09:00.070 --> 09:01.103
Oh, boy.

09:03.705 --> 09:04.906
You want me?
Come and get me.

09:04.974 --> 09:07.374
I'm gonna get you...
you can't get by me.

09:07.441 --> 09:08.842
You're down.

09:09.378 --> 09:10.644
Why would you do that?

09:10.712 --> 09:13.014
Winston, we're on
the same team.

09:14.316 --> 09:15.649
What are you doing?

09:15.717 --> 09:16.918
You did it!

09:16.986 --> 09:18.451
Touchdown!

09:18.519 --> 09:19.552
Man.

09:21.923 --> 09:22.890
N-N-No!

09:22.957 --> 09:23.790
Why?

09:25.960 --> 09:27.627
What's going on, Sid?

09:27.695 --> 09:29.562
Did you tell 'em
that ours works?

09:29.630 --> 09:31.110
Hey, guys, this is
available, no line.

09:31.165 --> 09:32.332
That Porta Potti

09:32.400 --> 09:34.200
- looks weird, Nick.
- What?

09:34.268 --> 09:36.302
It looks a little,
looks a little weird.

09:36.370 --> 09:37.803
You look a little
weird, Sanders.

09:37.871 --> 09:39.738
Why don't you wipe
your butt with a little

09:39.806 --> 09:41.840
strawberry crepe,
you little whiner?

09:41.909 --> 09:44.277
I don't really do well
with bathroom pressure.

09:44.344 --> 09:46.212
- Robby, don't dog me like this.
- I'm gonna give you your space.

09:46.280 --> 09:47.413
No, 'cause they're all
following you, Robby,

09:47.480 --> 09:49.415
they're all...

09:49.482 --> 09:50.615
Get in there.

09:50.682 --> 09:51.849
I don't have to go anymore.

09:51.918 --> 09:53.218
- Really?
- Yeah.

09:53.286 --> 09:54.752
So that's not full of pee?

09:54.820 --> 09:57.488
- No.
- I saw you drinking those sodas.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.190
- No, no, no, it's good.
- How about now?

09:59.258 --> 10:00.591
Stop, stop, you're gonna make me...

10:00.659 --> 10:02.193
I don't have to go,
I don't have to go.

10:02.261 --> 10:05.594
Get in there, dude,
or get out of this party.

10:05.798 --> 10:07.231
Wrong choice.

10:07.299 --> 10:09.333
Nick, what are you doing?

10:09.401 --> 10:10.734
I bought a Porta
Potti, Jess.

10:10.802 --> 10:11.902
- What, why?
- Yeah.

10:11.970 --> 10:13.070
- I'm a small business owner...
- You own

10:13.138 --> 10:14.704
- a Porta Potti?
- Yeah, but nobody's using it.

10:14.772 --> 10:16.407
This is not about a Porta Potti.

10:16.474 --> 10:18.008
It <i>is</i> about a
Porta Potti.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.043
I don't want to
talk about this.

10:19.110 --> 10:20.577
You know, it's been really nice

10:20.645 --> 10:22.045
hanging out with Jax

10:22.112 --> 10:24.914
because he likes to talk
about his feelings.

10:24.982 --> 10:26.615
Give me a break, Jess.
Is that really what you want--

10:26.683 --> 10:29.618
a man who talks about his
feelings all the time?

10:29.686 --> 10:31.054
No, right?

10:34.858 --> 10:37.593
Do you want me
to use your Porta Potti?

10:37.661 --> 10:39.594
Yeah, but don't just do it for
me; Do it 'cause <i>you</i> want to.

10:39.662 --> 10:41.496
Mm, I'm definitely
doing it for you.

10:41.564 --> 10:43.231
- And just a tip...
- Yeah?

10:43.299 --> 10:45.400
If you want people
to use your toilet,

10:45.468 --> 10:47.035
don't camp out in front of it.

10:47.103 --> 10:49.004
Do me a favor,
if you're going to go in.

10:49.072 --> 10:51.773
- Mm-hmm. - Really sell it, 'cause
I want girls to see it.

10:51.841 --> 10:53.408
- Okay. - You know what I mean?
Just, like, make a show of it.

10:53.476 --> 10:55.009
- Okay.
- Thank you.

10:55.110 --> 10:56.010
Bye, Jess, thank you

10:56.078 --> 10:58.245
Ooh, just my style!

10:58.313 --> 11:00.014
Nicely vintage.

11:00.082 --> 11:01.615
Can't wait to get inside!

11:01.683 --> 11:03.284
Sure wish I had a good book.

11:04.352 --> 11:05.119
Can't wait.

11:05.187 --> 11:07.388
Oh, this is horrible!

11:07.456 --> 11:09.223
I got it; You told
me like, ten times.

11:09.291 --> 11:11.358
Okay, but I'm just saying,
I don't know what that one does.

11:11.425 --> 11:13.526
Look, the instant
the big speech begins,

11:13.594 --> 11:15.095
you initiate toast sequence.

11:15.162 --> 11:16.396
You got that, Red?

11:16.464 --> 11:17.597
Look, don't-don't
mess this up.

11:17.664 --> 11:19.099
Tippy go bye-bye,
you mess this up.

11:19.166 --> 11:21.334
- Tippy go bye-bye.
- Okay.

11:21.402 --> 11:23.136
Okay, great.

11:23.204 --> 11:24.270
Bite me, you wang.

11:24.338 --> 11:25.538
What did you say, man?

11:26.606 --> 11:27.506
- Hey, Schmidt.
- Hey.

11:27.573 --> 11:28.874
You remember Shivrang?

11:28.941 --> 11:30.476
Shivrang, what is up, my man?

11:30.543 --> 11:32.244
Welcome to America.

11:32.312 --> 11:33.479
Listen, just a little heads up,
we're serving

11:33.546 --> 11:34.513
cow-meat tacos tonight, so...

11:34.580 --> 11:35.714
You mean beef.

11:35.781 --> 11:38.384
Cow meat, Shivrang.

11:38.451 --> 11:40.152
I'm not crazy.

11:40.220 --> 11:41.720
It is beef, right?

11:42.921 --> 11:44.088
Hey, can I just say

11:44.156 --> 11:46.190
I like you a lot?

11:47.592 --> 11:48.792
I like you, too.

11:48.860 --> 11:50.128
A lot?

11:50.195 --> 11:51.762
'Cause I said "A lot."

11:51.830 --> 11:55.133
I-I knew I felt this way,
the moment I met you.

11:55.200 --> 11:58.533
Yes, a guy who can tell me
exactly how he feels.

11:59.603 --> 12:00.870
That's what I want.

12:00.938 --> 12:02.172
That is what I want.

12:03.740 --> 12:04.874
It's just...

12:05.442 --> 12:07.645
You, uh...

12:09.212 --> 12:11.545
You make me...

12:12.050 --> 12:13.350
Are you okay?

12:13.918 --> 12:15.451
I-I like you a lot.

12:17.454 --> 12:18.587
Yeah, I-I...

12:19.155 --> 12:20.389
Yeah...

12:20.457 --> 12:21.657
I'm fine, I mean...

12:22.424 --> 12:23.459
You know what else I like?

12:23.527 --> 12:24.826
I like beer.

12:24.894 --> 12:26.495
I drink beer.

12:27.063 --> 12:28.730
'Cause I'm a man,
and I play football.

12:28.798 --> 12:30.998
You want some beer?
I'm gonna get a beer.

12:35.949 --> 12:38.083
- Hey, there you are.
- Hey, Schmidty.

12:38.451 --> 12:39.951
. It's almost toast time,
and I made... - Okay.

12:40.019 --> 12:41.620
...made up a few cards. You know,

12:41.688 --> 12:44.222
just jotted down a few notes
and bullet points for you.

12:44.223 --> 12:45.622
I was gonna do my own toast.

12:45.689 --> 12:47.090
I know what I want
to say about you.

12:47.158 --> 12:49.626
At least take a look at them.

12:49.693 --> 12:53.026
- I worked really hard on these.
- "I'm nothing without you."

12:53.398 --> 12:54.564
"Thank you for supporting me

12:54.632 --> 12:56.333
"during that thing,

12:56.401 --> 12:57.334
financially and..."

12:57.402 --> 12:59.236
This is a full speech.

12:59.303 --> 13:01.303
Feel free to make it your own.

13:01.371 --> 13:03.672
Why is it that you think
you're better than me, Schmidt?

13:03.740 --> 13:05.574
What? What are you
talking about?

13:05.642 --> 13:08.077
Why do you think
you're better than me?

13:08.145 --> 13:09.711
Our friendship didn't used
to be this way.

13:09.779 --> 13:11.514
You know, back in college,
we were equals.

13:11.581 --> 13:13.115
You get any last night?

13:13.183 --> 13:15.617
- No. You?
- Hell, yeah.

13:15.685 --> 13:17.718
- Really?
- No.

13:17.786 --> 13:20.588
- We're equals.
- Equals.

13:20.656 --> 13:22.524
And then you got that juicer,

13:22.591 --> 13:23.925
which I was excited about.

13:23.992 --> 13:25.860
You were
at a dangerous fat level,

13:25.928 --> 13:27.295
but somehow you got skinny,

13:27.363 --> 13:29.830
and I became this idiot
that you need to take care of.

13:29.898 --> 13:32.133
Don't resent me for
getting my life together.

13:32.201 --> 13:34.435
- Oh, your life's together?
- Yeah.

13:34.502 --> 13:36.002
You're throwing a party

13:36.071 --> 13:37.872
to celebrate living
with your college roommate

13:37.939 --> 13:39.673
- for ten years.
- Yeah.

13:39.740 --> 13:41.108
What are we doing here?

13:41.142 --> 13:43.177
What are we celebrating?

13:43.211 --> 13:45.145
What do you mean,
"what are we celebrating?"

13:45.213 --> 13:47.548
We're celebrating TinFinity!

13:48.615 --> 13:50.948
Ten years, two hearts,

13:51.017 --> 13:52.452
one home!

13:52.519 --> 13:54.087
Loyalty and great conversation.

13:54.154 --> 13:56.389
It's right here on the cards!

13:56.457 --> 13:59.525
Okay, that ain't right.

13:59.593 --> 14:01.427
- Hey, Winston.
- Aha.

14:01.995 --> 14:03.896
I see you've come to gloat.

14:03.964 --> 14:05.897
Is Jax known
for being intense?

14:05.965 --> 14:07.765
Yeah, Jess, he's supposed
to be intense.

14:07.833 --> 14:09.134
He's a professional athlete.

14:09.202 --> 14:10.602
You know, he doesn't run.

14:10.669 --> 14:12.104
He sprints.

14:12.171 --> 14:14.606
He doesn't jump.
He leaps.

14:14.673 --> 14:17.775
And he doesn't like, Jess.
He loves.

14:18.843 --> 14:20.212
Hmm.

14:27.352 --> 14:28.852
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:28.920 --> 14:30.821
Hey, look, I'm sorry about...

14:30.888 --> 14:33.424
No, no, no, no, don't be...
don't be sorry. It's...

14:33.492 --> 14:35.493
The truth is...

14:35.560 --> 14:38.495
I just got out of a relationship
that sort of crushed me.

14:39.562 --> 14:40.663
And everybody thinks that

14:40.731 --> 14:42.599
pro football players are
big and strong, and I am.

14:42.666 --> 14:44.534
It's true. Look.

14:44.602 --> 14:45.935
Whoa!

14:46.003 --> 14:47.470
This is nothing for me.

14:47.538 --> 14:48.904
I can have 20 of you.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.640
- Never put me down.
- But that means...

14:50.707 --> 14:52.542
when I fall, I fall hard.

14:52.610 --> 14:54.409
And yes, sometimes I cry.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.478
I cry, too.
I cry all the time.

14:56.546 --> 14:58.413
I cry in my bedroom,
in the bathroom,

14:58.481 --> 15:00.048
in the hallway,
in the elevator.

15:00.116 --> 15:02.518
This morning...
I woke up crying.

15:02.585 --> 15:05.787
I have this feeling...

15:05.855 --> 15:07.256
it's like

It's just, I'm really
annoyed about the lighting cues.

You mean, like,
take a trip together.

No, just, like,
walk 40 yards away.

18:34.626 --> 18:37.260
Don't think we need a trip
or anything like that, pal.

18:55.945 --> 18:57.613
So, what are you... what
are you doing in here?

18:57.680 --> 19:00.116
- I'm hiding.
- Oh, yeah, that guy.

19:00.183 --> 19:02.451
- He seemed to, uh, really like you
when he gave that speech. - Yeah.

19:02.919 --> 19:04.487
He might not be the one.

19:06.789 --> 19:08.069
So you still
thinking about Nick?

19:08.691 --> 19:11.192
No. Shut up. No.

19:11.260 --> 19:13.294
All right.

19:13.362 --> 19:15.730
Look at that, man.
You did get a balloon.

19:15.797 --> 19:18.733
Yeah, I got a kick-ass
hot air balloon.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.536
But it turns out, you need
propane to get it up in the air.

19:21.603 --> 19:23.005
- You didn't know that?
- How would I know?

19:23.006 --> 19:24.239
You didn't want to
do any research?

19:24.306 --> 19:27.507
How could I do any research?
I was dealing with the Porta Potti.

19:29.077 --> 19:30.477
It's actually kind of nice.

19:30.545 --> 19:31.845
It's peaceful.

19:31.913 --> 19:33.480
Yeah.

19:35.582 --> 19:38.152
Hey, I'm sorry about Cece, man.

19:38.219 --> 19:39.819
I know it sounds
kind of cheesy,

19:39.887 --> 19:42.355
but I always thought that
I was gonna be the man

19:42.423 --> 19:44.490
to bone Cece for
the rest of her life.

19:44.558 --> 19:45.925
I think we all did, buddy.

19:47.794 --> 19:49.595
To answer your question
from before,

19:49.663 --> 19:51.830
this is what
we were celebrating.

19:51.898 --> 19:53.533

19:58.204 --> 20:00.038
- Please.
- Ten years of living together

Upsetting, but kind of
great, man.

20:03.309 --> 20:05.810
