WEBVTT

00:00.174 --> 00:02.610
I stuffed things up.
Yes, you did.

00:02.703 --> 00:05.671
You can't ring me and leave
five messages for me at the office.

00:05.687 --> 00:08.180
I didn't want to. I thought you'd
be there. It was after five.

00:08.182 --> 00:09.699
No, I didn't go back yesterday
after court.

00:09.715 --> 00:11.379
I just got changed
and went to the gym.

00:11.442 --> 00:14.450
Bit of a swim, bike, treadmill, not
that I need to explain that to you.

00:14.466 --> 00:16.458
What's new in the Sex Crimes Unit?

00:16.474 --> 00:20.430
Timothy Clarke. Took
his computer in for repairs. Bingo.

00:20.446 --> 00:22.438
These were all found
a hundred folders deep.

00:24.402 --> 00:25.470
Mrs Vasilich.

00:25.486 --> 00:29.410
We have a warrant for your arrest for
the murder of Steven James Blakely.

00:29.426 --> 00:31.474
Forensics rechecked
Vasilich's jacket.

00:31.490 --> 00:34.438
They had a look inside the pockets
and they found blood.

00:34.454 --> 00:36.462
Dry-cleaning hadn't got it.
Blakely's blood.

00:36.478 --> 00:39.458
One of my accused wants to confess,
but he won't talk to me.

00:39.474 --> 00:42.438
One of the bikies?
Yes, Toby Franzen.

00:42.450 --> 00:43.486
Dianne Vasilich.

00:44.386 --> 00:46.426
Said she'd been trying to get
this bloke to tell her

00:46.438 --> 00:48.398
who had knocked off her daughter.

00:48.410 --> 00:49.458
I said, 'Fair enough. Who is he?'

00:49.470 --> 00:52.474
And she says it's Steve Blakely.

00:54.394 --> 00:55.454
You got a good lawyer?

00:55.470 --> 00:58.434
And what makes a good lawyer,
I wonder.

00:58.450 --> 01:01.418
How do you find
the defendant, Dianne Vasilich?

01:01.430 --> 01:03.438
Guilty.

01:03.454 --> 01:05.489
Well, I'm down near Gerringong.
Why?

01:06.342 --> 01:08.462
Because a bushwalker
just found Steven Blakely's body.

01:08.478 --> 01:11.450
So Dianne and Brian
didn't throw him off North Head.

01:11.466 --> 01:14.410
In fact, given the time it takes
to get here,

01:14.426 --> 01:16.458
they weren't even the ones
who buried him.

01:20.877 --> 01:42.681

01:48.398 --> 01:50.758
Mrs Vasilich,
your daughter was, by all accounts,

01:50.762 --> 01:53.730
exceptionally beautiful
and vivacious, yes?

01:53.742 --> 01:56.758
So why did she turn to prostitution?

01:56.774 --> 01:59.384
There was a complete
estrangement for two years,

01:59.385 --> 02:01.385
and then suddenly she was dead.

02:02.409 --> 02:05.389
Well, I put it to you that
you had to find who'd killed her,

02:05.405 --> 02:07.385
otherwise you could only
blame yourself.

02:07.397 --> 02:08.437
I just wanted justice...

02:08.453 --> 02:11.437
No, you desperately needed
someone to get you off the hook.

02:11.453 --> 02:14.069
That's why it became obsessive,
wasn't it?

02:14.128 --> 02:17.140
Because it wasn't just a frustration
with the lack of justice -

02:17.152 --> 02:19.120
it was a mother's guilt.

02:19.136 --> 02:23.184
That's a lie. I wasn't
obsessive, and I didn't hate anyone.

02:23.196 --> 02:26.144
I just wanted justice for Oriana!

02:31.144 --> 02:33.120
On the count of murder,

02:33.136 --> 02:36.136
how do you find the defendant,
Dianne Vasilich?

02:40.152 --> 02:41.200
Guilty.

02:43.116 --> 02:44.871
My client is an innocent woman,

02:45.116 --> 02:48.128
a victim of a system which favours
quick results over the truth.

02:48.144 --> 02:51.132
She and her son have been imprisoned
for a crime they did not commit.

02:51.148 --> 02:54.128
And the discovery of
Steven Blakely's body only confirms

02:54.144 --> 02:56.136
what they've been saying
from the start of this debacle.

02:56.152 --> 03:00.176
Once again, we see the danger of
Crown prosecutors

03:00.192 --> 03:04.172
being overly persuasive and
unnecessarily adversarial in court.

03:04.188 --> 03:07.140
Janet King's gung-ho approach
in this trial

03:07.156 --> 03:09.172
has caused
a serious miscarriage of justice.

03:09.188 --> 03:13.208
Perhaps if the DPP and the police
were not quite so hand in hand,

03:14.124 --> 03:17.136
we might have a more balanced
criminal justice system -

03:17.152 --> 03:19.188
not one which favours the
prosecution,

03:19.204 --> 03:23.116
and certainly not one which results
in the jailing of the innocent.

03:24.172 --> 03:27.156
That doesn't change anything.
The Vasilich woman killed him.

03:27.172 --> 03:30.132
Are you serious? We stuffed up. She
should never have been convicted.

03:30.135 --> 03:31.736
Could have organised someone
to bury him.

03:31.737 --> 03:33.137
So now she's a criminal mastermind?

03:33.140 --> 03:35.660
Or she hired someone to rough him
up. She could plan his murder.

03:36.120 --> 03:37.184
OK, let's say she did plan
the whole thing.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.168
Why wouldn't you pay to kill him?
Why tackle a big man like that?

03:40.184 --> 03:43.116
Burying's the easy bit.
I don't know. Self-satisfaction?

03:43.132 --> 03:46.204
Oh, God. This is exactly why
we should have waited.

03:47.056 --> 03:49.136
You push us into running this,
it goes off the rails.

03:49.152 --> 03:51.156
We're the ones who cop it.
Nothing's gone off the rails.

03:51.172 --> 03:54.120
We have a convicted murderer
and her accomplice in prison.

03:54.136 --> 03:56.136
We can't be sure of that.
What are you saying?

03:56.152 --> 03:59.120
She walks into Blakely's house,
disturbs the murderer, he hides,

03:59.136 --> 04:01.168
she puts her hand
in his blood and then leaves?

04:01.184 --> 04:03.168
That's your version of events?
Who buried him?

04:03.184 --> 04:05.192
Enough. Enough!
I have no idea.

04:05.204 --> 04:07.184
We are all in the shit here.

04:07.200 --> 04:11.176
There's no way the Vasilichs could
have buried the body? Impossible.

04:11.192 --> 04:13.196
They couldn't have made it
back to the hospital in time.

04:13.208 --> 04:15.148
Someone else buried the body.

04:15.164 --> 04:17.184
Not unless someone else killed him.
Unlikely.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.172
Well, keeping an open mind then,
are we?

04:19.184 --> 04:21.148
You know she's guilty, come on!

04:21.164 --> 04:23.164
It's only one detail at the end
that's changed.

04:23.180 --> 04:26.176
So where did Dianne and her son go,
then, after they killed Blakely?

04:26.192 --> 04:29.148
If they're giving themselves
an alibi by going to the hospital,

04:29.160 --> 04:30.200
why not go straight there?

04:30.628 --> 04:33.188
They drove Blakely's car with the
body to the guy who'd bury him.

04:33.204 --> 04:36.116
They told that guy to leave
the car at North Head.

04:36.132 --> 04:38.184
Why not take the gravedigger with
you? Isn't that easier?

04:38.200 --> 04:41.136
Could be half a dozen
different ways it happened.

04:41.152 --> 04:42.192
And there's your reasonable doubt
right there.

04:42.208 --> 04:46.144
You find this third man,
or Dianne and her son will walk.

04:49.180 --> 04:52.132
They've already started
crawling out of the woodwork.

04:52.144 --> 04:53.144
No surprise.

04:53.160 --> 04:56.168
Every crim and his dog will be
putting up their hand for this one,

04:56.184 --> 04:58.192
after the deal we got
our bikie friend Franzen.

04:58.208 --> 05:01.148
Waste of time and resources
we don't have.

05:01.164 --> 05:03.140
You never know
what the tide might wash up.

05:03.152 --> 05:04.188
See you back there.

05:04.204 --> 05:07.160
I'm hoping our third man
left his business card in the grave,

05:07.172 --> 05:09.148
along with the murder weapon.

05:14.120 --> 05:15.168
As you can see,

05:15.184 --> 05:18.168
bashed in the back of the head
with something heavy - three blows.

05:18.180 --> 05:20.184
Attacked from behind. Gutless.

05:20.200 --> 05:23.180
Fell forwards, causing a depressed
fracture of the cheek.

05:23.192 --> 05:25.128
Any DNA not his?

05:25.144 --> 05:28.136
Anything else you've found that might
help us identify who buried him?

05:28.152 --> 05:30.116
Not so far.
I'd say they were pretty careful.

05:30.132 --> 05:32.148
Other injuries?
Nothing major.

05:32.164 --> 05:35.188
There are small, shallow lacerations
on both feet, across the soles.

05:35.204 --> 05:38.152
The dirt in them matches the dirt
around the gravesite.

05:38.168 --> 05:41.180
What else? There's paint
under his fingernails, in his hair.

05:41.196 --> 05:43.148
Off-white, matte.
Yeah.

05:43.164 --> 05:46.116
The paint is of a domestic type.
He was renovating.

05:46.132 --> 05:47.612
The place was chaos,
stuff everywhere.

05:47.963 --> 05:50.164
Which accounts for the cricket bat
they buried with him.

05:50.180 --> 05:53.148
Solid murder weapon.
Bit of weight behind it. A handle.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.400
But the dirt in the lungs means

05:55.112 --> 05:57.128
he was still alive
when he was buried.

05:59.132 --> 06:02.156
He wouldn't have known anything
about it, if it's any consolation.

06:02.172 --> 06:05.164
He would have died
from the head wounds anyway.

06:05.180 --> 06:08.124
But the immediate cause of death
was suffocation.

06:11.112 --> 06:12.172
They buried him alive.

06:28.136 --> 06:31.168
Last time I was here,
we had a chat about Dianne...

06:31.180 --> 06:34.112
Dianne Vasilich. I remember.

06:34.128 --> 06:38.172
Now, you pointed out Toby Franzen.
You point her towards anyone else?

06:38.188 --> 06:40.208
Hang on, it's not like
I brokered that deal.

06:41.124 --> 06:43.176
I never thought
she'd actually go and talk to him.

06:43.192 --> 06:46.124
Did she ever ask about, you know,
anyone else?

06:46.140 --> 06:51.188
She doesn't talk much. She's um...
a bit of a fixture in here.

06:52.188 --> 06:54.176
Ever since Oriana was murdered.

06:55.180 --> 07:00.156
I guess this is the closest thing
she has to Oriana's grave, you know?

07:00.172 --> 07:03.160
A bit tragic, really,
the whole thing.

07:03.176 --> 07:06.176
I mean,
sometimes Dianne brings flowers.

07:06.192 --> 07:10.176
Sometimes she... she just sits here
and stares into space.

07:10.192 --> 07:15.172
On Oriana's birthday, every year,
she totally writes herself off,

07:15.184 --> 07:17.156
and me, or whoever else is on,

07:17.172 --> 07:19.176
has to call her son
to come and take her away.

07:21.192 --> 07:23.196
She was alright, Oriana.

07:24.112 --> 07:27.196
You know, a bit messed up
with the drugs, but...

07:28.112 --> 07:29.713
You know,
she always came and said hello.

07:30.116 --> 07:33.120
And through all the crap you
could see she was well brought up.

07:34.188 --> 07:39.132
And you never saw Dianne talking
to anyone else other than Franzen?

07:39.144 --> 07:40.156
No.

07:43.144 --> 07:48.172
Did you see her, or her son,
on the night of 9th October?

07:48.184 --> 07:51.128
No idea.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.148
You got CCTV in the car park?

07:58.112 --> 07:59.512
I suppose you'll be wanting a look?

08:05.172 --> 08:08.140
You got some time to help me
go over my application today?

08:08.156 --> 08:10.357
You still want to train up to be a
Crown after all this?

08:11.112 --> 08:14.112
Yes, I think so. No, I do.

08:14.128 --> 08:17.136
Even if there are weeks like this,
I really like appearance work

08:17.152 --> 08:20.132
and Solicitor Advocate's
the next logical step.

08:20.148 --> 08:23.124
What, you're not doubting
what we do, are you?

08:23.136 --> 08:24.172
Are you kidding?

08:27.124 --> 08:29.164
Tim Clarke, my child porn man.

08:31.128 --> 08:36.155
Will the jury look at him and see him
for the monster that he is,

08:36.172 --> 08:39.200
or will they think, 'We've all looked
at stuff we shouldn't have.

08:40.116 --> 08:44.116
He's just like us. He wasn't the one
actually causing the suffering.'

08:44.131 --> 08:47.140
He does look normal,
whatever that means.

08:48.184 --> 08:52.116
So many of the photos he's got
are taken with hidden cameras.

08:53.256 --> 08:56.276
Imagine what it would be like to find
out that men, all over the world,

08:56.288 --> 08:58.240
are watching you get undressed.

08:58.252 --> 09:00.192
Or raped.

09:00.208 --> 09:02.264
Your photos could be out there
for the rest of your life.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.240
Someone could walk past you
in the street

09:04.252 --> 09:07.236
and recognise you as that girl.

09:07.248 --> 09:09.208
What would that do to you?

09:09.224 --> 09:13.196
Or... or think about
those abuse victims

09:13.212 --> 09:15.200
who are too embarrassed
to tell anyone what happened,

09:15.216 --> 09:17.284
and then a video of your abuse
goes viral.

09:18.200 --> 09:20.244
I haven't ever
thought about it like that.

09:20.256 --> 09:22.252
That's all I think about.

09:36.252 --> 09:38.260
Excuse me, sir.

09:38.276 --> 09:40.244
Hey, what'd you get
from the Lions Gate?

09:40.256 --> 09:42.192
Nothing the night of the 9th.

09:42.208 --> 09:45.204
No DVD labelled with that date.
Either they're crap at labelling...

09:45.220 --> 09:47.228
Or someone's taken the footage
from that night.

09:47.244 --> 09:49.264
Why didn't you call?
I went back to the Lions Gate.

09:49.276 --> 09:51.236
I checked out the shop next door.

09:51.248 --> 09:53.216
Think the owner'd be very happy

09:53.232 --> 09:55.196
for us to find
something criminal going on.

09:55.208 --> 09:57.196
He's not what you'd call a fan.

09:57.212 --> 09:59.208
He's got a camera
on the car park as well.

09:59.220 --> 10:01.204
DVD of the 9th.

10:04.232 --> 10:06.196
That's Blakely's car.
Mm-hmm.

10:13.196 --> 10:15.316
It's the wrong time of day.
What the hell is he doing?

10:17.232 --> 10:18.280
That's Blakely.

10:39.224 --> 10:40.305
Can you freeze that for me?

10:44.248 --> 10:47.220
And just... yeah.
Get in a bit closer, yeah.

10:55.268 --> 10:57.216
Danny Novak.

10:59.208 --> 11:02.208
Car park of the Lions Gate Hotel,
4:30pm.

11:02.224 --> 11:05.284
Blakely must have driven there
straight after court.

11:06.196 --> 11:07.232
Blakely and Novak?

11:07.244 --> 11:09.196
They argue for about five minutes.

11:09.212 --> 11:10.276
Blakely gets in his car
and he drives away.

11:10.288 --> 11:12.280
Four hours later, Blakely is dead.

11:13.196 --> 11:17.192
Blakely pulled this file out
two days before he died.

11:17.208 --> 11:19.192
He was going to
reopen the investigation.

11:20.216 --> 11:22.208
Oriana Vasilich.

11:25.196 --> 11:27.232
This is the hotel room
where she was killed.

11:43.256 --> 11:45.208
Did Blakely have a suspect?

11:45.224 --> 11:47.264
According to his notes
he knew exactly who it was.

11:47.280 --> 11:50.200
He just couldn't prove it.
Danny Novak.

11:50.212 --> 11:51.272
Owner of the Lions Gate.

11:51.284 --> 11:53.268
So Blakely calls him up.

11:53.284 --> 11:57.216
Tells him he's going to reopen the
investigation and go after him.

11:57.232 --> 12:00.228
Once it's in the system, it doesn't
matter if Blakely's behind bars.

12:00.244 --> 12:03.204
Novak employed Oriana. He used
her to sweeten business deals.

12:03.220 --> 12:05.220
She knew a lot about things
she shouldn't have.

12:05.236 --> 12:08.192
If he felt he couldn't trust her
anymore. Bye-bye, Oriana.

12:08.204 --> 12:09.252
But it's still just a theory, right?

12:09.268 --> 12:12.256
There wasn't any proof that Novak
was involved. It's just supposition.

12:12.272 --> 12:14.284
DNA tests prove a lot more these
days.

12:14.704 --> 12:17.224
Who knows what they might find?
Pretty good motive for a murder.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.240
So Dianne Vasilich
didn't kill Blakely?

12:19.256 --> 12:21.236
We will continue looking
for our third man,

12:21.252 --> 12:23.244
but we'll divert some resources
to Novak.

12:23.260 --> 12:26.252
Surveillance, listening devices,
phone taps, the whole lot.

12:26.264 --> 12:28.268
Um, excuse me.

12:36.204 --> 12:37.256
Watch it!
Sorry.

12:39.272 --> 12:42.204
Hey, I'm heading home.
Are you ready to go?

12:42.220 --> 12:44.256
No, no, not yet.
I'll be here for hours.

12:44.268 --> 12:46.240
Will you be OK getting home?

12:46.252 --> 12:48.220
Oh, I'll find someone to protect me.

12:48.236 --> 12:51.216
What I should do is stop panicking
every time I hear a motorbike.

12:51.232 --> 12:54.288
Look, I'll walk you and come back.
No, no, no. I'm good.

12:55.200 --> 12:56.236
Stay. Stay.

13:39.280 --> 13:42.216
Andy, hi.

13:42.228 --> 13:44.284
Oh look, I'm still at the office.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.196
I'll just grab
a piece of toast when I get in.

13:48.208 --> 13:50.260
Promise I won't work too hard.

13:50.276 --> 13:53.280
Look, I've gotta go.
I'll speak to you soon.

14:21.200 --> 14:22.248
U-J-U...

15:15.252 --> 15:17.248
You came.

15:17.264 --> 15:21.280
Oh, I've decided it takes too much
energy to keep ignoring you.

15:25.224 --> 15:27.252
Right, well you wanted to talk,
so talk.

15:29.252 --> 15:33.276
We can talk about what happened
and what went wrong and how we feel,

15:34.192 --> 15:35.632
but it isn't going
to change my mind.

15:42.820 --> 15:44.260
I don't know
whether it's a good idea

15:44.276 --> 15:47.256
for you to be staying with Danny
while you're here.

15:47.272 --> 15:50.192
Your father's not
exactly popular with the police.

15:50.208 --> 15:52.260
I was just thinking that
maybe it's better for your career,

15:52.276 --> 15:56.228
now that you're not living in Sydney,
to really distance yourself from him.

15:56.244 --> 16:00.244
Sorry, you wanted to talk to me
about where I'm staying?

16:03.196 --> 16:06.200
Your career's really taking off,
that's all.

16:06.216 --> 16:08.240
I'd just hate
for all of your hard work

16:08.256 --> 16:12.216
to be undone by something like
guilt by association.

16:12.232 --> 16:16.192
Not guilt, definitely not guilt,
but... you know.

16:17.248 --> 16:20.192
What have you heard?
N-nothing.

16:20.208 --> 16:22.232
You've heard something about Dad.
No, nothing.

16:25.260 --> 16:27.232
I don't believe you.

16:30.268 --> 16:34.196
Look, as long as you're staying
there, I can never come and see you.

16:39.192 --> 16:40.236
Thanks for the drink.

17:44.208 --> 17:46.204
Don't worry about it, Princess.

17:46.220 --> 17:48.240
It's just like
issuing parking tickets.

17:48.256 --> 17:51.228
They need to get their numbers up,
so they drop in and see me.

17:51.244 --> 17:54.204
What are they looking for?
Well, entertainment.

17:54.220 --> 17:56.740
No, I'm serious, Dad. What was
on the warrant? Can I look at it?

17:56.808 --> 17:59.248
Well, they waved it in front of me,
but didn't leave it, so...

17:59.260 --> 18:01.204
It's nothing important. Trust me.

18:01.220 --> 18:03.196
No, Dad,
that wasn't just a casual thing.

18:03.212 --> 18:04.692
They took away your computers.
Mm-hmm.

18:05.204 --> 18:07.244
What else did they take?
I don't know. Nothing.

18:07.260 --> 18:10.224
The warrant has to state
what they're investigating you for.

18:10.236 --> 18:11.272
Well, the easiest thing to do

18:11.288 --> 18:13.240
is just to cooperate,
isn't it? Be polite.

18:13.256 --> 18:15.220
Best way to show
you've got nothing to hide,

18:15.232 --> 18:17.212
which I don't, OK?

18:18.240 --> 18:20.260
OK.

18:20.276 --> 18:22.252
Really OK?
Yeah.

18:22.264 --> 18:24.200
Good.

18:25.244 --> 18:27.192
You eaten?

18:47.208 --> 18:51.192
Oh, Amanda, hi.

18:51.208 --> 18:53.192
Oh, hi, Janet.
Are you, um...

18:53.208 --> 18:56.212
Ash had to nip out for a bit.
She asked me if I could stay on.

18:56.224 --> 18:59.240
Oh, right. OK. Hello, sweeties.

18:59.256 --> 19:02.232
Hello, my little one.
And how's work?

19:02.248 --> 19:06.220
The usual. Have you been creating
havoc today, huh?

19:06.236 --> 19:08.272
Who's up for a bath?
Want to have a bath?

19:08.288 --> 19:13.200
They've actually had a bath.
Oh. Oh, good. Thank you.

19:13.216 --> 19:14.736
I didn't know how long you'd be.
Right.

19:15.200 --> 19:16.248
No, that's fine. Um...

19:18.196 --> 19:21.244
Um, I'm happy to take over now,
if that's OK.

19:21.256 --> 19:23.268
Oh, OK. Thanks.

19:26.192 --> 19:27.236
See ya, Thing One.

19:31.260 --> 19:33.208
And see ya, Thing Two.

19:33.220 --> 19:36.192
I'm introducing them to Dr Seuss.

19:36.208 --> 19:39.192
Oh, fun. See you.
Bye.

19:46.196 --> 19:50.196
Well, don't look at me. Mary Poppins
is the one running the show now.

19:51.284 --> 19:53.232
Ah, here's Mum.

19:53.248 --> 19:55.256
Thought I'd make it home before you.
Surprise.

19:55.272 --> 19:58.196
Did you see Amanda?
Yeah. Ah...

19:58.212 --> 19:59.260
Isn't she great with them?
Mm.

19:59.276 --> 20:02.192
Hmm. Where have you been?
You look all zhooshed up.

20:02.208 --> 20:03.272
I had to grab something
up the road.

20:03.288 --> 20:06.268
I was sick of them them always
seeing me in my hausfrau outfit.

20:06.284 --> 20:09.244
Pasta OK?

20:09.256 --> 20:11.280
Ah, sure.

20:16.280 --> 20:18.284
Raid last night, chat this morning.

20:19.196 --> 20:20.232
I'm flattered.

20:21.244 --> 20:25.268
Night of Wednesday, October 9th.
What were you doing?

20:27.212 --> 20:29.204
At home, I guess.

20:29.220 --> 20:32.208
That's where I spend my nights.
It's boring, I know.

20:32.224 --> 20:34.200
Anyone verify that?
I can.

20:34.216 --> 20:36.260
I'll check in my diary.
I'll get back to you.

20:36.272 --> 20:38.232
So what'd you do at home that night?

20:38.248 --> 20:41.236
Well, I probably cooked
and watched TV.

20:41.248 --> 20:43.288
It's hard to remember specifically.

20:44.204 --> 20:48.212
If you were in the vicinity of Steven
Blakely's house, we'll find out.

20:48.224 --> 20:50.192
We'll track where your mobile was

20:50.208 --> 20:52.228
through, you know,
transmission tower records.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.260
We're also going to subpoena

20:54.276 --> 20:56.252
your phone records
for the last two months,

20:56.264 --> 20:58.248
so if you've got anything to say,

20:58.264 --> 21:00.228
it's probably best
that you say it now.

21:02.220 --> 21:04.204
Nothing to say.

21:07.196 --> 21:08.636
Want to tell
me what's going on here?

21:14.272 --> 21:18.228
Disagreement over a car park.
Four hours later, Blakely's dead.

21:18.244 --> 21:20.248
You're the last person seen with him,
and you're arguing.

21:20.264 --> 21:24.232
That's not a good look, is it?
So why don't you cut the crap?

21:24.248 --> 21:26.276
I didn't kill him.
He was a friend of mine.

21:26.288 --> 21:29.208
My condolences.

21:29.220 --> 21:31.192
Whether you did it yourself,

21:31.208 --> 21:34.224
or you paid some arsehole to do it
for you, we're gonna find out.

21:34.236 --> 21:36.248
And that's a promise.

21:40.196 --> 21:43.284
Richard!
What are they looking at Dad for?

21:44.200 --> 21:46.212
I... I don't know.
Yes, you do.

21:46.228 --> 21:49.192
You gave me some bullshit story
about moving out of the house.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.196
I go home
and find the cops raiding the place.

21:51.212 --> 21:52.272
What did Danny say?
Tell me, Richard.

21:52.288 --> 21:54.284
I'm not supposed to be talking
to you about this.

21:55.200 --> 21:58.244
It's a bit late for a crisis of
conscience now, isn't it?

22:01.260 --> 22:04.280
He's a suspect
in the murder of Steven Blakely.

22:06.220 --> 22:09.264
A murder suspect?
I... I didn't want to say anything.

22:11.228 --> 22:13.216
Why would he want to kill
Steven Blakely?

22:13.228 --> 22:15.196
Because they think...

22:15.212 --> 22:18.196
..they think he killed Dianne
Vasilich's daughter, Oriana.

22:23.260 --> 22:26.192
That is such bullshit.

22:41.216 --> 22:45.220
Blakely and Novak argue
on the afternoon of Blakely's death.

22:45.236 --> 22:47.216
Blakely dies
before he can reopen a case

22:47.228 --> 22:49.196
in which Novak is the prime suspect.

22:49.208 --> 22:50.244
That can't be a coincidence.

22:50.260 --> 22:52.260
Novak always knew
Steve would reopen the case.

22:52.276 --> 22:55.232
Well, reasonable assumption -
that's what the argument's about.

22:55.248 --> 22:57.288
Reasonable assumptions
don't stand up in court.

22:58.204 --> 23:01.208
Now, all we need to do is find
something tying him to the murder.

23:01.220 --> 23:02.500
And if not him, then his lackey.

23:03.200 --> 23:06.196
At the moment, the only person
we knew was definitely there,

23:06.212 --> 23:08.236
besides Blakely,
was Dianne Vasilich.

23:08.252 --> 23:10.236
But we have to...
We all want to get Novak.

23:10.252 --> 23:13.264
I can appreciate that. But the next
time we go into court on this case,

23:13.276 --> 23:15.240
whatever we have, whoever it is,

23:15.256 --> 23:18.252
I want to be rock fucking solid,
alright?

23:19.276 --> 23:22.200
Excuse me, sir. Sorry to interrupt.

23:22.216 --> 23:23.272
There's a Tatum Novak
here to see you.

23:23.284 --> 23:25.228
Said you'd know what it's about.

23:32.212 --> 23:34.284
Tatum, hi.
Hi, Andy.

23:35.200 --> 23:38.192
I hear you're down in Canberra now.
Yeah, with the Commonwealth.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.208
You get to do
all that big international stuff.

23:40.220 --> 23:42.200
All their trafficking, drugs, people.

23:42.216 --> 23:44.248
Those things sound more glamorous
than they actually are.

23:44.260 --> 23:46.200
Tell me about it.

23:47.208 --> 23:49.204
So, you're here about...

23:49.216 --> 23:51.256
Steven Blakely's disappearance.

23:51.268 --> 23:53.236
I want to make a formal statement.

23:55.196 --> 23:58.220
You sure about this?
Yes, I am.

23:58.232 --> 24:01.196
OK. Come through this way.

24:07.208 --> 24:09.228
Hey, how'd you go last night?
Last night?

24:09.244 --> 24:11.240
Yeah, did you get all the work done
you wanted?

24:11.252 --> 24:13.236
Oh yeah, almost. Never-ending.

24:13.252 --> 24:14.292
You know how it is.
I know.

24:15.200 --> 24:18.204
I've got this Solicitor Advocate
interview on top of everything else.

24:18.216 --> 24:20.196
Mmm, don't wait.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.408
Oh, OK, I'll see you in there.

24:22.192 --> 24:23.244
Place runs on coffee.

24:23.260 --> 24:25.280
Hi, the usual, thanks.
Short black.

24:26.280 --> 24:28.256
The cops won't give out information

24:28.272 --> 24:30.248
about number plates to us,
will they?

24:30.264 --> 24:34.204
You want something like that traced,
aren't you married to the right guy?

24:36.204 --> 24:38.212
Or you could ask
an ex-police prosecutor

24:38.228 --> 24:40.252
who might still be able
to pull a favour or two,

24:40.264 --> 24:42.260
and keep his mouth shut.

24:43.264 --> 24:46.204
Maybe I could.
Hmm.

24:47.212 --> 24:50.260
Anyone feel like doing any work
today? Lina?

24:53.268 --> 24:56.240
Perhaps a table in the corner
for the overflow.

24:56.256 --> 24:58.248
I don't want overflow.
I don't want any of it.

24:58.264 --> 25:01.196
Oh, I don't believe choice is
involved.

25:01.212 --> 25:04.244
If you are not coping,
you need to ask for assistance.

25:04.256 --> 25:05.244
I'm coping.

25:05.260 --> 25:08.212
We take occupational health and
safety very seriously here.

25:08.228 --> 25:11.288
That makes me feel better already.
Have you made your appointment yet?

25:12.204 --> 25:15.272
Counselling is compulsory for all
solicitors in the Sex Crimes Unit.

25:15.284 --> 25:16.272
I haven't, no.

25:16.288 --> 25:18.276
Counselling's not to be
underestimated.

25:19.192 --> 25:20.912
It is a powerful tool,
which can provide you

25:21.192 --> 25:22.252
with practical mechanisms
for coping.

25:22.268 --> 25:25.228
Accepting counselling
is not an admission of weakness.

25:25.244 --> 25:28.216
It's simply taking responsibility
for yourself and your work.

25:28.232 --> 25:29.288
So do you?
I don't need it.

25:31.192 --> 25:33.272
I thought you might be reluctant.

25:33.284 --> 25:36.256
Appointment. Five o'clock.

25:56.200 --> 25:57.248
How'd you go?

25:57.264 --> 26:01.204
She says Danny was home all night,
didn't even make a phone call.

26:06.264 --> 26:09.236
She's a lawyer, right?
Yeah, Commonwealth DPP.

26:09.252 --> 26:11.220
She wouldn't want
to fuck up her career.

26:11.232 --> 26:13.204
We should keep the pressure on him.

26:13.220 --> 26:16.216
There's someone here
I'd like you to have a talk to.

26:23.196 --> 26:27.200
Brian Vincent turned up at my place
with a fistful of cash.

26:27.212 --> 26:28.272
Asked me to do him a favour.

26:28.284 --> 26:30.232
Which was?

26:30.248 --> 26:32.228
He had something
in the boot of this car.

26:32.244 --> 26:34.244
It was wrapped in one of those
painting sheets.

26:34.260 --> 26:37.240
You know the ones you use
to stop shit getting everywhere?

26:40.192 --> 26:41.244
He wanted it buried.

26:41.256 --> 26:43.280
I took it down to Gerringong.

26:44.196 --> 26:47.228
And dug a hole, chucked it in,
along with the bat.

26:47.244 --> 26:49.268
Then I drove the car
back to North Head,

26:49.284 --> 26:52.288
and then I went home
and I had a beer.

26:54.240 --> 26:56.252
I thought
we should bring you up to date.

26:56.268 --> 26:58.272
You've found us the third man?
Not quite.

26:58.284 --> 27:01.252
Ah, he's being coy. Go on.

27:01.268 --> 27:04.288
We've interviewed Danny Novak, who...
Of course, he denies everything.

27:05.088 --> 27:07.208
And his daughter's got an alibi for
him on that night.

27:07.224 --> 27:10.220
The night that Blakely died?
What other night?

27:10.232 --> 27:11.224
Just clarifying.

27:11.240 --> 27:14.256
Now out of all the crims who have
come forward, looking for a deal,

27:14.268 --> 27:17.216
we have this bloke, Leon Cranford.

27:17.232 --> 27:19.264
It was a big four-wheel
drive.

27:19.280 --> 27:22.240
Took it down to Gerringong,
dug a hole,

27:22.252 --> 27:24.228
chucked it in, along with the bat.

27:24.244 --> 27:26.224
Then I drove the car
back to North Head,

27:26.236 --> 27:28.212
and I went home and I had a beer.

27:28.228 --> 27:31.224
Now there's another 40 minutes
of it, but that's the juicy bit.

27:31.236 --> 27:32.676
So Danny's out of the picture, then?

27:33.188 --> 27:35.228
Danny argued with Blakely
four hours before he died.

27:35.240 --> 27:36.276
He's still in our sights.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.224
We can test this guy's story,

27:38.240 --> 27:40.260
but he seems to know things
that we never made public.

27:40.276 --> 27:43.220
Like the drop cloth,
the exact burial site, the weapon.

27:43.236 --> 27:45.397
How does he know Dianne Vasilich?
Well, he knows Brian.

27:45.955 --> 27:48.236
He says they were drinking buddies
down at the Lions Gate.

27:48.248 --> 27:49.252
Well, what's he want?

27:49.268 --> 27:52.196
I assume he's not chatting
out of the goodness of his heart.

27:52.212 --> 27:55.216
Yep, he's currently on bail
for dealing meth.

27:55.228 --> 27:57.260
Not much goodness of heart there.

27:57.276 --> 28:00.256
He wants those charges dropped
and a guarantee of a year

28:00.272 --> 28:02.236
for being the gravedigger.
A year?

28:02.252 --> 28:05.240
For taking part in the murder of an
Assistant Police Commissioner?

28:05.256 --> 28:06.276
He didn't kill him.
Sorry.

28:06.427 --> 28:08.268
Accessory after the fact
is still an accessory.

28:08.284 --> 28:11.268
He might have killed him. There's no
evidence tying him to murder scene.

28:11.284 --> 28:14.228
Dianne Vasilich seems to have
cornered that market.

28:14.244 --> 28:16.268
Well, you were the one who said
she wasn't a criminal mastermind.

28:16.280 --> 28:18.244
This guy's story fits.

28:18.256 --> 28:19.456
They turned up at his doorstep

28:20.200 --> 28:22.228
on the night of the murder,
all panicked,

28:22.240 --> 28:23.252
with a body in the boot.

28:23.268 --> 28:26.196
He's got form, needs cash.
It's a win-win situation.

28:26.212 --> 28:29.204
Could have heard it anywhere - down
at the Lions Gate, on the street.

28:29.220 --> 28:32.192
That's why we're not charging him
and why we're still watching Novak.

28:32.208 --> 28:34.240
If we test Cranford
and he proves to be on the level,

28:34.256 --> 28:38.252
he's not going to swear to anything,
unless we promise him that deal.

28:41.280 --> 28:44.236
We need to start
thinking about this appeal.

28:44.252 --> 28:46.260
Vasilich?
Ned Kelly. Yes, Vasilich.

28:46.276 --> 28:49.212
You don't think Cranford
will prove to be the third man?

28:49.224 --> 28:50.252
I think there'll be an appeal.

28:50.268 --> 28:52.232
Dianne didn't do it?
I don't know.

28:52.244 --> 28:53.264
But not if Cranford's...

28:53.280 --> 28:56.264
Look, there are a lot of ifs,
and one of them leads to an appeal.

28:56.280 --> 28:58.224
If we're forced to run that,
I'd prefer

28:58.240 --> 29:00.224
it wasn't rushed
like everything else.

29:00.236 --> 29:01.557
Grab a tea and we'll get started.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.228
Um, I... Sorry, do you mind?

29:04.244 --> 29:06.252
I have an appointment.
Just give me half an hour.

29:12.228 --> 29:13.276
What the hell, Tatum?

29:14.192 --> 29:16.236
Let go of me!
You lied to the police.

29:16.252 --> 29:18.272
I don't know what you're talking
about. Bullshit!

29:18.288 --> 29:21.204
I saw you the day after,
the day that Blakely disappeared.

29:21.220 --> 29:23.244
You told me you didn't go home.
You went to the gym.

29:23.256 --> 29:25.200
Swim, bike, treadmill, remember?

29:25.216 --> 29:27.224
That was weeks ago.
You've got your days mixed up.

29:27.240 --> 29:28.272
I don't. It's me.
I remember everything.

29:28.288 --> 29:30.232
I could tell you which earrings
you wore,

29:30.248 --> 29:32.208
which suit, the exact time
of our conversation.

29:32.220 --> 29:33.236
Oh, you make things so hard.

29:33.252 --> 29:37.212
I didn't lie to the police.
I lied to you, OK?

29:37.228 --> 29:39.588
I didn't want you to know my
schedule, what time I got home.

29:40.200 --> 29:41.640
Well, they're still looking
at Danny.

29:42.140 --> 29:44.220
If they find anything to tie him
to that crime scene,

29:44.236 --> 29:47.196
or that he ordered someone else
to do it, your career is sunk.

29:47.208 --> 29:48.268
You think about that.

29:48.280 --> 29:50.224
You'd better think that you gave me

29:50.240 --> 29:53.216
confidential information
about a police investigation.

29:53.228 --> 29:55.208
What, so now you're blackmailing me?

29:55.224 --> 29:57.272
I'm just telling you that you don't
have the moral high ground.

29:57.288 --> 29:59.276
I haven't perverted
the course of justice!

29:59.288 --> 30:02.204
Yes, you have!

30:10.220 --> 30:13.220
Did you cop a truckload of work
from Our Lady of the Schedule?

30:13.236 --> 30:15.272
Yep. Want something
to take your mind off it?

30:15.288 --> 30:19.220
Mm, I could do with some cheering.
I didn't say it would cheer you up.

30:19.232 --> 30:21.228
You seriously need to think about

30:21.244 --> 30:23.256
getting this Clarke guy
off the streets.

30:23.272 --> 30:26.224
He's a bad man. You found
something with the number plates?

30:26.240 --> 30:28.264
I asked a mate who asked a mate
who asked a mate.

30:28.280 --> 30:31.256
So you get the benefit of the
lawyer network and the cop network?

30:31.272 --> 30:34.216
Put up with a lot of shit
from both sides too.

30:39.272 --> 30:42.252
Tim Clarke, previously known
as 'Tim Cunningham',

30:42.268 --> 30:44.280
convicted of the rape of a
14-year-old in Adelaide,

30:45.192 --> 30:46.268
served eight years.

30:46.280 --> 30:49.192
Told you it wasn't cheering.

30:49.204 --> 30:51.196
I can't use this.

30:51.212 --> 30:54.208
You want to rethink slipping a photo
of a six-year-old into his file?

30:54.224 --> 30:58.216
No, I... I can't. I can't.
Really? Conscience?

30:58.232 --> 31:01.196
This from the woman who knows his
car has South Australian plates.

31:01.212 --> 31:03.252
Bet that information's not in the
file. Why are you here?

31:03.268 --> 31:07.216
Your appointment's in 20 minutes.
Go, go. Oh no, I'll reschedule.

31:18.216 --> 31:19.264
Bye.

31:21.260 --> 31:23.236
She'll feel better for it.

31:36.236 --> 31:38.280
You're uncomfortable being here.

31:39.196 --> 31:42.236
Oh, I'm only here
because it's compulsory.

31:42.252 --> 31:46.208
I'll explain what I'll do
and what we'll do together.

31:46.220 --> 31:48.288
That might make things easier, OK?

31:50.276 --> 31:53.240
Sometimes people
who do the sort of work you do,

31:53.256 --> 31:56.204
experience
traumatic stress disorder.

31:56.220 --> 31:58.272
Although you
yourself haven't suffered abuse,

31:58.288 --> 32:04.212
the work you do exposes you to the
stress of witnessing the horrors.

32:04.228 --> 32:09.252
It's important to distinguish
between a normal response

32:09.264 --> 32:11.240
to witnessing a traumatic event

32:11.256 --> 32:14.192
and something
which becomes abnormal.

32:19.272 --> 32:21.216
It's completely normal

32:21.232 --> 32:24.252
to feel anxious and fearful,
to have bad dreams,

32:24.268 --> 32:26.276
to not be able
to stop thinking about

32:27.192 --> 32:29.208
what you've seen, heard
or experienced,

32:29.220 --> 32:31.260
to become obsessive.

32:31.276 --> 32:35.228
The problems arise when you get
stuck in that psychological state.

32:38.276 --> 32:41.208
Have you experienced
any of these responses

32:41.224 --> 32:43.244
since working in
the Sex Crimes Unit?

32:45.192 --> 32:46.236
No.

32:46.248 --> 32:47.369
You haven't behaved in a way

32:48.200 --> 32:50.260
which is outside the realm
of your usual behaviour?

32:50.276 --> 32:53.196
Something that made you
stop and think,

32:53.208 --> 32:55.216
'I don't know who just did that'?

32:56.220 --> 32:58.236
Never.

32:58.252 --> 33:02.200
You're not drinking more?
Using drugs?

33:02.216 --> 33:06.212
Avoiding sex, fighting with
your husband over small issues?

33:13.220 --> 33:16.256
Do you always shut down like this
when things get too difficult?

33:17.256 --> 33:19.224
I don't know what you mean.

33:19.240 --> 33:22.248
It must put a strain on your
marriage,

33:22.264 --> 33:25.228
this distancing, this refusal
to admit what's happening...

33:25.240 --> 33:27.212
My marriage is none of your business.

33:27.228 --> 33:31.200
Your emotional and
psychological health is my business.

33:31.216 --> 33:33.497
Knowing how you function
in your marriage is part of that.

33:34.204 --> 33:36.244
I'm here to discuss work.
I'm not judging you, Lina.

33:36.252 --> 33:40.200
No, you're talking to me
like I'm a child.

33:43.264 --> 33:46.244
Tell me about your work, then...
What do you want to know?

33:46.256 --> 33:48.196
Do you find it satisfying?

33:48.212 --> 33:50.013
Do you feel
like you're making a difference...

33:50.192 --> 33:52.288
Things only get to my desk
when the damage is done.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.272
I-I can't make any difference at all!

33:55.284 --> 33:58.204
I'm completely impotent.

33:59.204 --> 34:01.224
Th-that's a good
Freudian term for you.

34:01.236 --> 34:03.200
Why don't you write that one down?

34:03.212 --> 34:05.228
'Lina also has anger issues,

34:05.244 --> 34:07.208
probably stemming from
the fraught relationship

34:07.220 --> 34:09.252
she has with her father.'

34:09.264 --> 34:11.235
How am I doing?

36:48.276 --> 36:51.276
I'll cook tonight.
I was thinking spag bol.

36:51.288 --> 36:53.224
Won't say no.

36:53.240 --> 36:57.192
Andy Campbell talked to me
yesterday. What about?

36:57.204 --> 36:59.252
He was asking about 9th October,

36:59.268 --> 37:01.280
the night that Steven Blakely
disappeared.

37:03.276 --> 37:06.212
That was the night that we watched

37:06.228 --> 37:08.188
that English Premier League
soccer game, remember,

37:08.200 --> 37:09.240
and we ate pad thai?

37:09.252 --> 37:11.260
I couldn't forget that night.

37:11.276 --> 37:14.228
You were busy trying to teach me
the finer points of soccer,

37:14.244 --> 37:16.280
while I was choking
from too much chilli.

37:17.196 --> 37:18.836
Well, I warned you
about the killer sauce.

37:19.192 --> 37:23.192
And you bought that disgusting Thai
beer. You still drank it.

37:23.208 --> 37:25.224
Yeah, because I was dying
of chilli poisoning.

37:25.240 --> 37:27.481
You were trying to get your head
around the offside rule.

37:28.040 --> 37:29.240
Too busy watching the players.

37:29.256 --> 37:32.236
They do have great legs.
But it's a boring game.

37:32.252 --> 37:35.244
Which is why I made you watch
another match that I'd prerecorded.

37:35.256 --> 37:37.192
Yeah.

37:37.204 --> 37:38.280
And you kept me up so late

37:39.196 --> 37:41.288
I could barely stay awake at court
the next day.

37:42.200 --> 37:43.288
It was a good night.

37:44.200 --> 37:46.244
Yes, Princess, it was.

37:46.260 --> 37:49.240
I'd better head off.
I'll walk you to your car.

38:02.196 --> 38:04.264
I'm very proud of you.
You know that, don't you?

38:04.276 --> 38:06.248
Yeah, I do.

38:06.260 --> 38:08.200
You're smart, but you work hard.

38:08.216 --> 38:10.272
Your colleagues respect you
and what you do.

38:10.288 --> 38:14.216
Oh, I think they do. I hope so.
And respect's very important.

38:14.232 --> 38:17.212
It takes a lot to earn it
and it can go just as fast.

38:17.228 --> 38:20.196
And that goes for self-respect
as well.

38:21.088 --> 38:22.248
Don't fuck up what you've got

38:22.264 --> 38:25.196
by getting involved in things
that don't concern you.

38:25.212 --> 38:26.240
I know.
No, you don't.

38:26.256 --> 38:29.252
That's why I'm telling you.
Don't interfere.

38:31.216 --> 38:34.248
Dad, I'm sorry. I was just...
It's OK. It's alright.

38:34.260 --> 38:37.236
Nothing more to say, OK?

38:37.248 --> 38:39.248
Did you know Oriana Vasilich?

38:39.260 --> 38:41.244
Who?

38:41.260 --> 38:44.200
Dianne Vasilich's daughter.
The one who was murdered.

38:46.196 --> 38:47.244
I've never heard of her.

38:47.260 --> 38:50.236
Now if you want to keep that job
in Canberra,

38:50.252 --> 38:53.272
you'd better get down there
and do some work, eh?

38:53.288 --> 38:56.248
This Canberra thing,
moving down there,

38:56.264 --> 38:59.240
it had nothing to do
with that Richard character, did it?

38:59.256 --> 39:02.216
He didn't mess you around or hurt you
or anything...

39:02.228 --> 39:03.589
Oh, no. No, no. Nothing like that.

39:04.204 --> 39:07.192
It was a good offer
and a great career move.

39:07.208 --> 39:10.240
It worked out really well, except
I don't get to see you as much.

39:13.220 --> 39:15.232
I love you, sweetheart.
You too.

39:31.208 --> 39:33.212
I'm off, Amanda.
Thanks for tonight, too.

39:33.224 --> 39:35.212
It's a pleasure!

39:36.268 --> 39:39.212
- Janet King speaking.
- Hi, it's me.

39:39.228 --> 39:41.208
Hey, whose phone
are you calling from?

39:41.224 --> 39:44.204
Jennifer's. I left mine at
home. Hey, can you do me a favour?

39:44.220 --> 39:46.228
I need to drop in on Danielle
from mother's group.

39:46.244 --> 39:49.208
I totally forgot to bring her
address. I can't. I'm racing.

39:49.224 --> 39:52.224
On my computer. I need to grab her
before she leaves for work. Sorry.

39:52.240 --> 39:56.232
Well, maybe you should take your
phone with you. Alright, here it is.

39:56.244 --> 39:59.204
Ah, laptop. What do you need?

39:59.220 --> 40:02.200
It's mail from Danielle Rowe.
Came yesterday.

40:02.212 --> 40:04.280
Danielle Rowe. Hang on, here it is.

40:05.196 --> 40:09.192
Ah, address. 108 Cartwright Street.
Thank you, that's great.

40:09.208 --> 40:11.256
May I go to work now?
Of course.

40:12.256 --> 40:15.252
I'll see you tonight.
See you then.

40:50.196 --> 40:52.288
Good morning.
Not necessarily.

40:53.204 --> 40:55.216
Tony's waiting for you
in his office.

40:55.232 --> 40:56.432
Detective Campbell is with him.

40:57.196 --> 40:59.260
Maybe that will brighten your day.
Hmm, doubt it.

41:03.196 --> 41:06.224
Hey. Ah, at last.
What do you have for us?

41:06.240 --> 41:09.212
OK, we found this last night
under the Douglas Park bridge,

41:09.228 --> 41:11.196
exactly where Cranford
said it would be.

41:11.212 --> 41:13.224
Fingerprints?
Well, mud and water.

41:13.240 --> 41:15.228
Unlikely to be able
to lift anything useful.

41:15.244 --> 41:17.364
We're still checking for DNA,
but that's unlikely too.

41:18.200 --> 41:21.196
There's some dirt we found lodged
underneath the metal hand grip

41:21.212 --> 41:23.268
that comes from the same area
we found Blakely's body.

41:23.284 --> 41:26.224
Well, this spade was definitely
used to bury him, then.

41:26.240 --> 41:28.212
Yes.
But you don't know who handled it.

41:28.228 --> 41:30.240
I'd say the bloke
who told us where it was buried

41:30.252 --> 41:31.280
handled it, wouldn't you?

41:32.196 --> 41:34.216
Not necessarily.
Lucky guess by Cranford, was it?

41:34.228 --> 41:35.244
Someone might have told him.

41:35.260 --> 41:37.276
We've confirmed
he drinks at the Lions Gate.

41:38.192 --> 41:41.200
Dianne Vasilich and Brian Vincent
have been there on many occasions.

41:41.216 --> 41:44.204
They had time to go from
Blakely's place to Cranford's,

41:44.216 --> 41:45.256
drop the car and the body there

41:45.272 --> 41:49.240
and get back to the hospital by 8:21
to be caught on the CCTV.

41:49.256 --> 41:53.220
Now, he told us about
the burial site, the murder weapon

41:53.232 --> 41:54.472
and where the spade was buried.

41:55.204 --> 41:57.224
None of those facts
were known by the public.

41:57.236 --> 42:00.204
We also found five grand in cash

42:00.220 --> 42:01.268
hidden in a biscuit tin
in his kitchen.

42:01.284 --> 42:04.212
He's a saver.
He's an accessory to murder.

42:04.228 --> 42:07.228
We're charging him. And we're also
going to give him the deal he wants.

42:07.240 --> 42:10.200
Unless anyone has any objections?

42:12.196 --> 42:14.200
We're being pushed around again.

42:14.216 --> 42:16.240
I'd prefer to think of it
as being cooperative.

42:16.256 --> 42:18.240
You seriously want to give Cranford
that sort of deal?

42:18.256 --> 42:20.776
You think they should they charge
and have him plead not guilty?

42:21.196 --> 42:24.208
Why not? Test his story in court.
And risk him being acquitted?

42:24.224 --> 42:27.192
If there's enough doubt surrounding
his story, he should be acquitted.

42:27.208 --> 42:29.192
He wants to plead!
He wants a deal.

42:29.208 --> 42:31.200
What,
you think he didn't bury Blakely?

42:31.216 --> 42:33.224
He could have overheard someone
bragging.

42:33.240 --> 42:36.236
Maybe he was paid to take the fall.
Maybe he killed Blakely himself.

42:36.252 --> 42:39.264
You see, this is guilt speaking.
Your guilt.

42:39.280 --> 42:42.256
You're terrified we've made
a mistake with Dianne Vasilich,

42:42.272 --> 42:45.216
and you're desperately trying
to find proof of that.

42:45.232 --> 42:49.216
You didn't convict her. The jury
did. I know how the system works.

42:49.232 --> 42:51.220
Well, we can't let emotions
cloud our judgements.

42:51.236 --> 42:53.244
By 'we' you mean 'me'?
I'm too soft, am I

42:53.260 --> 42:55.220
Mother of young children.
That what you're saying?

42:55.232 --> 42:58.248
Because it's bullshit. I'm one of the
best prosecutors in this place.

42:58.264 --> 43:01.260
If I have a feeling about
Dianne Vasilich, it's not hormonal -

43:01.276 --> 43:04.240
it's intuitive, and that is
a product of years of hard work.

43:04.256 --> 43:08.244
Well, wrap your intuition
around this. Occam's razor.

43:08.256 --> 43:10.256
Dianne Vasilich killed Blakely.

43:10.272 --> 43:13.248
She had motive,
she had his blood in her pocket,

43:13.260 --> 43:15.196
she calls her son Brian for help.

43:15.212 --> 43:16.652
Brian has a connection
with Cranford.

43:17.196 --> 43:20.216
Cranford admits
to burying the body and the bat,

43:20.232 --> 43:23.244
and he knew details about the burial
that only the police knew.

43:23.260 --> 43:28.224
Now, you can forget everything else,
forget double guessing yourself.

43:28.240 --> 43:30.481
There was a question raised
by the discovery of the body.

43:31.204 --> 43:33.192
That question has been
answered, has it not?

43:33.208 --> 43:35.196
There are a number of
possible answers.

43:35.212 --> 43:39.288
Well, this particular answer
is not beyond all doubt,

43:40.204 --> 43:42.224
but it is beyond reasonable doubt,
I believe,

43:42.240 --> 43:44.268
and that is why we will accept
Cranford's plea,

43:44.284 --> 43:48.244
and we will recommend the sentence
as suggested by the police. Yes?

43:52.228 --> 43:55.220
Yes.
Thank Christ for that.

43:59.236 --> 44:03.208
This afternoon we arrested
and charged a man, Leon Cranford,

44:03.220 --> 44:04.244
in connection to the murder

44:04.260 --> 44:06.232
of Assistant Commissioner
Steve Blakely.

44:06.248 --> 44:08.280
The man has been
very cooperative with police,

44:09.196 --> 44:12.260
and will be appearing in court
shortly, where he will plead guilty

44:12.276 --> 44:15.232
to disposing of the body
of Steve Blakely

44:15.244 --> 44:17.260
in a shallow grave near Gerringong.

44:17.276 --> 44:20.272
Good result.
Is it?

44:20.284 --> 44:22.192
Isn't it?

44:22.208 --> 44:24.236
Because the police got it wrong about
Danny Novak.

44:24.252 --> 44:29.196
Ah, well, no, because we got it
right about Dianne and her son.

44:29.212 --> 44:31.276
Have a good night.

44:31.288 --> 44:33.224
Goodnight.

44:34.232 --> 44:37.284
Hey, Ash. I'm sorry, yeah.

44:38.196 --> 44:39.264
I'm still at work.

44:39.280 --> 44:41.240
Look, I'll have to meet you there,
OK?

44:42.248 --> 44:44.224
Thanks. Bye.

44:52.276 --> 44:56.268
Should we be worried we
haven't heard anything from Amanda?

44:56.280 --> 44:58.216
No.

45:02.280 --> 45:05.220
You want me to text her?
Yes.

45:05.236 --> 45:07.240
Then I don't look like
the overanxious one.

45:10.196 --> 45:13.232
I thought you'd be relieved now that
the Blakely thing is finally sorted.

45:13.248 --> 45:16.272
I am.
You don't seem relieved.

45:16.288 --> 45:20.268
Are you relieved to have a job
offer? Thank you.

45:20.280 --> 45:22.216
Thank you.

45:26.256 --> 45:28.220
I was going to tell you.

45:28.236 --> 45:31.228
You said
you weren't going to pursue it.

45:31.244 --> 45:34.264
I did, but they wouldn't take no
for an answer.

45:37.228 --> 45:39.268
That's why you were late that night,
wasn't it?

45:39.284 --> 45:43.264
Out of your hausfrau clothes?
That was just a preliminary chat.

45:43.276 --> 45:45.276
Oh, that makes it alright.

45:45.288 --> 45:48.224
I was going to tell you.

45:48.240 --> 45:51.284
When? The day you started?
It's not an offer.

45:51.707 --> 45:53.268
I still have to go through
an interview.

45:53.284 --> 45:56.220
Yeah, Wednesday the 30th.
I know. I saw the email.

45:56.236 --> 45:59.208
You read my private messages?
You told me to look in your mail.

45:59.224 --> 46:00.825
There it was.
You didn't have to read it.

46:00.927 --> 46:03.208
You didn't have to have
a preliminary chat behind my back.

46:03.224 --> 46:04.704
You always have to control
everything.

46:10.196 --> 46:11.244
We had a deal.

46:13.200 --> 46:16.212
You were staying home full-time
with the kids, and now you're not.

46:16.228 --> 46:19.196
Isn't that worth discussing?
I didn't want to discuss it.

46:19.212 --> 46:21.232
I knew you'd be like this.
What, betrayed?

46:21.248 --> 46:24.216
I... I haven't betrayed you.
What, lying's not a betrayal?

46:24.232 --> 46:27.256
You're always so fucking perfect.
Don't you put it back on me.

46:27.268 --> 46:29.220
You're so tied up with your work

46:29.236 --> 46:32.204
you don't see what's going on
around you anymore.

46:32.216 --> 46:36.196
You don't see me. Not anymore.

46:37.240 --> 46:39.204
I'm going to go pay.

46:56.220 --> 47:00.232
Hey. Ready to send Harry Lime away
for a long time?

47:00.244 --> 47:01.252
Harry Lime?

47:01.264 --> 47:04.196
The Third Man. Carol Reed.

47:04.208 --> 47:06.272
Don't worry about it. You OK?

47:06.288 --> 47:09.220
Fine, I'm just tired.
Kids. Must be exhausting.

47:09.236 --> 47:12.208
Do you think I'm too controlling?
I'm not the right person...

47:12.224 --> 47:14.505
Someone has to be in control.
Otherwise nothing gets done.

47:15.200 --> 47:18.256
Of course. Big difference between...
in control and controlling. Sure.

47:18.272 --> 47:20.240
Do you have enough autonomy,
working with me? Tons.

47:20.256 --> 47:21.280
I'm approachable?
Always.

47:22.196 --> 47:23.200
Helpful?
Definitely.

47:23.212 --> 47:24.200
Yeah.

47:24.216 --> 47:26.280
We should get going.
Yeah.

47:33.228 --> 47:38.232
Mr Cranford, can you describe
to Her Honour your family situation?

47:40.272 --> 47:42.284
I'm on a disability pension.

47:43.200 --> 47:47.224
I had a car accident and broke me
leg. It's not good.

47:47.240 --> 47:49.276
I'm in a lot of pain.
Too much pain to work.

47:50.192 --> 47:53.248
The drugs, the painkillers,
are really expensive.

47:53.260 --> 47:56.224
My wife and I have two kids.

47:56.240 --> 48:00.208
They're both at school.
She is unemployed.

48:00.220 --> 48:01.268
She was made redundant.

48:01.284 --> 48:03.272
She hasn't worked
for a couple of years,

48:03.288 --> 48:06.280
and half the time
we're fed by the Salvos.

48:07.196 --> 48:10.236
What do you have to say about your
recent conviction for drug charges?

48:11.260 --> 48:15.240
Surely that criminal endeavour
provided some profit?

48:15.252 --> 48:17.264
It was a once-off, and I got done.

48:17.276 --> 48:19.236
I see.

48:19.252 --> 48:22.204
Look, when Brian came around
and offered me some work,

48:22.220 --> 48:25.228
I was desperate for money.
For my kids.

48:25.244 --> 48:28.244
It's the only reason I done it,
and I'm sorry.

48:28.260 --> 48:31.220
I realise it was
a dumb-arse thing to do.

48:32.280 --> 48:35.256
Thank you, Mr Cranford.

48:36.260 --> 48:38.260
Madam Crown?

48:38.272 --> 48:40.272
Thank you, Your Honour.

48:44.264 --> 48:49.260
Mr Cranford, you'd describe yourself
as a good family man?

48:49.272 --> 48:52.224
I am.

48:52.240 --> 48:54.232
Doing your utmost
to take care of your kids.

48:54.244 --> 48:55.232
Of course.

48:55.244 --> 48:56.284
Everything you do in life

48:57.200 --> 48:59.256
is designed around
what's best for your children.

48:59.268 --> 49:00.264
Absolutely.

49:00.280 --> 49:03.220
Such as dealing drugs,
burying dead bodies?

49:03.232 --> 49:04.252
I was desperate.

49:04.268 --> 49:07.204
Not much of an example to set
them... Objection!

49:07.220 --> 49:09.276
I...
Withdraw that remark.

49:11.256 --> 49:13.264
And now you're sorry.

49:13.276 --> 49:15.212
Yes.

49:15.228 --> 49:18.236
If you're so sorry, why didn't you
confess to the police immediately?

49:18.248 --> 49:20.208
'Cause I was scared.

49:20.224 --> 49:23.196
You waited until
you thought you might get a deal.

49:23.212 --> 49:25.236
So I could be around for my kids
more.

49:28.208 --> 49:30.224
How much do you make
burying a dead body?

49:30.240 --> 49:34.192
Do you charge by the hour? Did you
have to provide your own spade...

49:34.208 --> 49:36.236
Your Honour,
my client is being harassed.

49:36.252 --> 49:38.208
Your Honour,
characterising the burying

49:38.220 --> 49:39.581
of what you know to be a dead body

49:40.023 --> 49:42.264
as the act of a man
desperate to provide for his children

49:42.280 --> 49:44.268
is contemptuous
of this court and of the law.

49:44.284 --> 49:47.252
Hey? Mr Cranford,
you willingly assisted

49:47.268 --> 49:50.244
in the burial of the body
of a murdered man for the money.

49:50.260 --> 49:52.252
I didn't help kill anybody!
It's a nonsense to say

49:52.264 --> 49:54.192
that you did it for your family...

49:54.204 --> 49:55.232
All I did was dig a hole,

49:55.248 --> 49:58.220
chuck him and the baseball bat in,
and that's it!

49:58.236 --> 50:00.244
I'm sorry, you chucked him
and what into the hole?

50:00.260 --> 50:03.272
The baseball bat.
Are you sure about that?

50:06.204 --> 50:09.220
Your Honour, in light of the
defendant's recent response,

50:09.236 --> 50:11.280
I seek leave to enter
a nolle prosequi

50:12.196 --> 50:15.200
in relation to the indictment
currently before the court.

50:15.216 --> 50:19.236
A new indictment against Mr Cranford,
containing one count each

50:19.252 --> 50:22.240
of perjury and attempting to pervert
the course of justice

50:22.252 --> 50:24.216
will be filed in due course.

50:24.232 --> 50:26.260
I object.
Madam Crown.

50:26.276 --> 50:31.196
Steven Blakely was murdered
and buried with a cricket bat.

50:31.208 --> 50:33.196
A Gray-Nicolls, to be precise.

50:33.212 --> 50:36.196
Which Mr Cranford would have known
if he'd buried him,

50:36.208 --> 50:38.272
which he most clearly did not.

50:38.284 --> 50:41.216
Your Honour, this is outrageous.

50:41.232 --> 50:45.196
I will stand this case down until
tomorrow morning at ten o'clock,

50:45.212 --> 50:47.260
at which time
I want clear submissions

50:47.276 --> 50:51.212
on what has happened here today
from both counsel.

50:53.204 --> 50:54.256
That was a gift.

50:54.272 --> 50:57.228
Whoever put him up to it
should ask for their money back.

50:57.244 --> 51:00.204
This is insane.
What is it with you and this case?

51:00.220 --> 51:02.248
The guy was working.
It was pitch black.

51:02.264 --> 51:04.248
He didn't have a torch,
and he made a mistake.

51:04.264 --> 51:06.208
Even in the dark
there's a big difference

51:06.220 --> 51:07.620
between a baseball and cricket bat.

51:08.192 --> 51:11.196
You were there, were you? Why didn't
you ask him what sort of bat it was?

51:11.208 --> 51:14.200
Jack, this is never-ending.

51:14.212 --> 51:16.272
We will finish this, OK? I promise.

51:16.288 --> 51:19.288
Come on.
Let me buy you guys a coffee.

51:21.228 --> 51:24.232
Do you think Cranford'll talk? He's
looking at serious time for perjury.

51:24.244 --> 51:25.268
That might help persuade him.

51:25.284 --> 51:28.228
Depends on how much money he was
paid and how scared he is.

51:28.244 --> 51:31.256
While we're leaning on him, we're
working from the opposite direction.

51:31.268 --> 51:33.200
Novak won't know what hit him.

51:33.216 --> 51:34.272
Danny?
I thought he'd been ruled out.

51:34.288 --> 51:37.244
Cranford either overheard something,
or he was paid to lie.

51:37.260 --> 51:40.252
Novak is going to be at the other
end of one of those scenarios.

53:47.712 --> 53:50.272
Get the fuck away from her! Fuck!
You get the hell away from her!

53:50.288 --> 53:52.272
What the hell?
I will not let you hurt her...

53:52.288 --> 53:55.212
Are you right?
I know who you are and what you do.

53:55.228 --> 53:57.204
What's your problem?
You're my problem.

53:57.220 --> 53:59.228
I know what you do with young girls.
You rape them.

53:59.244 --> 54:02.200
That's what you did in Adelaide.
You're a filthy fucking rapist!

54:02.216 --> 54:04.192
You're nuts, woman.
Don't worry.

54:04.208 --> 54:05.252
Hey. I'll look after you.
Come with me.

54:05.264 --> 54:07.196
You touch her and I'll kill ya.

54:07.212 --> 54:09.244
You forced her into your car.
I saw you.

54:09.256 --> 54:12.196
Leave my dad alone.

54:12.212 --> 54:14.256
You're freaking her out.
I'm calling the cops.

54:57.216 --> 54:59.220
You ran the Blakely murder trial.

54:59.232 --> 55:00.264
That's right.

55:00.276 --> 55:02.200
The Vasilich family

55:02.216 --> 55:05.268
had nothing to do
with that murder, and neither did I.

55:05.284 --> 55:08.240
The police are wasting their time
harassing me about it.

55:10.264 --> 55:13.276
Blakely's murder
is just a small part of it.

55:15.220 --> 55:17.204
A small part of what?

55:18.272 --> 55:22.260
If you want to sort this mess,
ask yourself -

55:22.276 --> 55:25.200
how did Alex Moreno
manage to get acquitted?

55:30.204 --> 55:31.252
Have a nice evening.

55:53.196 --> 55:54.916
I don't want anyone to think
this government

55:55.196 --> 55:57.220
has locked up an innocent person.
Shut it down.

55:57.236 --> 56:00.276
If the police had done their job
properly and found Blakely's body

56:01.192 --> 56:03.913
before they charged Dianne Vasilich
we wouldn't be in this situation.

56:04.200 --> 56:06.232
We're drowning in work
and you're stalking Renmark.

56:06.248 --> 56:08.260
Someone leaned on him.
Something's wrong.

56:08.272 --> 56:10.244
The government has appointed

56:10.260 --> 56:13.200
recently retired judge
Granville Renmark

56:13.216 --> 56:16.220
to inquire into the functioning
of the Office of the DPP.

56:16.236 --> 56:18.200
How dare you invade
the privacy of my home.

56:18.216 --> 56:22.196
As a Crown Prosecutor, you're held
to the highest standards.

56:22.212 --> 56:26.260
Just like a judge. I'd tread very
carefully if I were you, Ms King.
