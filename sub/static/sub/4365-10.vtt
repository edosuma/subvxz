Previously on
<i>Suits...</i>

00:01.197 --> 00:02.225
This is a copy of the letter

00:02.226 --> 00:03.425
you wrote a copy
to the district attorney

00:03.426 --> 00:04.993
when you threatened
expose me.

00:04.994 --> 00:07.470
You ever do send that letter,
you're in the same boat as me.

00:07.471 --> 00:08.638
You want to move in here?

00:08.706 --> 00:11.408
I've only ever
been here twice,

00:11.475 --> 00:13.493
and both times
were with you.

00:13.577 --> 00:15.257
You beat me
on the dissolution negotiation,

00:15.279 --> 00:16.439
you get your name
on the door.

00:16.447 --> 00:17.314
If you think you're gonna win
this time,

00:17.381 --> 00:18.632
you've got another thing
coming.

00:18.716 --> 00:20.083
You ready to use
your relationship with Rachel

00:20.151 --> 00:21.451
to get her father to turn?

00:21.519 --> 00:23.153
Doesn't matter,
because I'm not gonna do that.

00:23.220 --> 00:25.155
Folsom Foods.
This is about Harvey Specter,

00:25.222 --> 00:27.691
Jessica Pearson,
and their divorce negotiations,

00:27.758 --> 00:29.059
and you don't go to the one
you didn't marry

00:29.126 --> 00:30.326
to stick it
to the one you did.

00:30.361 --> 00:31.561
It's a check
from Folsom Foods.

00:31.562 --> 00:33.163
It's the remainder
of what they owe us.

00:33.230 --> 00:35.365
If you crush me,
I'll have nothing.

00:35.433 --> 00:36.399
He was bullying me.

00:36.467 --> 00:38.101
So you used me
to bully him back.

00:38.169 --> 00:39.052
If you don't want
to live with me,

00:39.136 --> 00:40.103
why don't you just tell me?

00:40.171 --> 00:41.504
I just need some time.

00:41.572 --> 00:43.606
- Hessington Oil just fired us.
- Scottie betrayed me.

00:43.674 --> 00:45.408
I gave you my word,
and I honored it.

00:45.476 --> 00:46.943
Something dropped
from the sky,

00:47.011 --> 00:49.179
tilted everything in your favor
right after I cut you a break?

00:49.246 --> 00:51.798
I am not going to dissolve
this merger.

00:51.882 --> 00:52.816
You already signed
the agreement.

00:52.883 --> 00:54.183
Then sue me.

00:54.235 --> 00:56.319
Scottie didn't get us fired.
Ava Hessington did.

00:56.387 --> 00:58.088
She's suing all of us.

00:58.155 --> 01:00.023
I got into Stanford.

01:02.000 --> 01:08.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:16.107 --> 01:19.275
You have something
to say to me?

01:19.343 --> 01:21.344
I'm sorry, Scottie.

01:21.412 --> 01:24.314
I didn't believe you,
but you were telling the truth.

01:25.716 --> 01:27.384
Why does it always
have to be so--

01:27.451 --> 01:28.918
- I said I was sorry.
- You didn't mean it.

01:28.986 --> 01:30.286
I meant it.

01:30.354 --> 01:32.022
But just because I was wrong
about you betraying me

01:32.089 --> 01:34.257
doesn't mean I was wrong
to think you might have done it.

01:34.325 --> 01:35.792
See, this is what I mean,
Harvey.

01:35.860 --> 01:38.261
If you thought anything of me,
you'd know I'd never do that.

01:38.329 --> 01:39.629
I do think something
of you,

01:39.697 --> 01:41.731
which is why I'm going to
tell you this: Get out.

01:41.799 --> 01:43.933
Honor the dissolution agreement
and move on.

01:44.001 --> 01:45.635
You've got to be
kidding me.

01:45.703 --> 01:48.505
You want me to put
all the liability on Edward?

01:48.572 --> 01:50.173
The liability
belongs on Edward.

01:50.241 --> 01:51.775
So when you say that you think
something of me,

01:51.842 --> 01:53.376
what you actually mean is
you want me to help you

01:53.444 --> 01:54.878
to bail
on Darby International.

01:54.945 --> 01:56.346
Scottie,
when this lawsuit's over,

01:56.414 --> 01:57.614
there's not going to be
a Darby International.

01:57.681 --> 01:59.215
- You don't know that.
- What I know is

01:59.283 --> 02:00.850
you have a chance
to get another job

02:00.918 --> 02:03.420
before everything hits the fan.
You won't in another week.

02:03.487 --> 02:05.255
I won't need another job
when I right the ship.

02:05.322 --> 02:07.123
You're not going to right
the ship.

02:07.191 --> 02:09.859
If you were on that jury,
the only question you'd ask

02:09.926 --> 02:12.762
is how many zeroes
to put on the check.

02:16.117 --> 02:18.168
You want me to turn my back
on the man

02:18.235 --> 02:21.571
that I've been in the foxhole
with for the last ten years.

02:21.639 --> 02:23.206
Would you do the same?

02:23.274 --> 02:25.308
If that man turned out
to have sanctioned murder

02:25.359 --> 02:28.211
without my knowledge and let me
take the hit, I would.

02:32.450 --> 02:35.651
Hmm.

02:35.703 --> 02:39.622
Well...like it or not,
you're in the foxhole with me.

02:39.690 --> 02:42.409
So order a glass
of your Macallan 20-pretentious,

02:42.493 --> 02:45.328
and let's figure out how we're
going to fight this together.

02:51.936 --> 02:53.903
You haven't said a word
all night.

02:53.971 --> 02:55.305
Are we going to talk
about this or not?

02:55.372 --> 02:56.806
What is there
to talk about?

02:56.857 --> 02:58.297
This is why you didn't want
to decide

02:58.308 --> 03:00.076
whether to live with me
or not, right?

03:00.144 --> 03:01.644
Well, it isn't,
actually,

03:01.712 --> 03:03.680
but you knew that I was
applying to Stanford,

03:03.747 --> 03:05.448
and you said that you'd support
whatever decision I made.

03:05.516 --> 03:08.218
I did, but then
you got into Columbia,

03:08.285 --> 03:10.587
so I thought
that wouldn't matter anymore.

03:10.638 --> 03:12.172
Because Stanford's
in California,

03:12.256 --> 03:14.257
and Columbia's here.
And because Columbia

03:14.325 --> 03:16.509
is an amazing school
and we said we love each other.

03:16.594 --> 03:18.061
Yeah, but it's not
that simple.

03:18.129 --> 03:20.997
It sounds that simple to me.

03:22.683 --> 03:26.586
[Stutters]
What I mean is

03:26.670 --> 03:28.404
I'm not built
the same as you.

03:28.472 --> 03:30.707
I need to decide
what school is better for me

03:30.774 --> 03:33.276
before factoring in you or us
or anything else.

03:33.344 --> 03:34.761
And how exactly
do you plan on doing that?

03:34.845 --> 03:36.713
The same way that I make
all the important decisions

03:36.780 --> 03:39.165
in my life,
by weighing the pros and cons

03:39.250 --> 03:40.583
of both schools.

03:40.651 --> 03:42.885
And where does not being
with me rank on that list?

03:42.937 --> 03:44.504
You're missing the point.

03:44.588 --> 03:46.556
I am trying to figure out
which school is best for me

03:46.623 --> 03:48.424
in a vacuum.
No, you're missing the point.

03:48.476 --> 03:50.426
You're trying to figure out
what school is best for you

03:50.478 --> 03:52.261
as though I didn't exist,
but I do.

03:52.313 --> 03:54.030
- Mike--
- Rachel, I'm not saying

03:54.081 --> 03:56.399
that you have to
go to Columbia.

03:56.467 --> 03:59.836
We're adults.
We're together.

03:59.904 --> 04:02.605
At some point, you're going to
have to factor that in too.

04:02.656 --> 04:03.873
[Door closes]

04:06.043 --> 04:08.928
- She go for it?
- No, she didn't.

04:09.013 --> 04:10.914
Then if Scottie won't
separate from us amicably,

04:10.981 --> 04:12.282
we'll make her do it
forcibly.

04:12.349 --> 04:14.150
Jessica, I don't want to start
another war with her.

04:14.218 --> 04:15.658
- Then what's your idea?
- My idea is

04:15.719 --> 04:17.921
we act like lawyers
and we fight the lawsuit.

04:17.988 --> 04:19.755
On its merits?

04:19.822 --> 04:22.892
Edward Darby sanctioned murder.
We don't stand a chance.

04:22.943 --> 04:26.095
- Jessica--
- Harvey, you know I'm right,

04:26.163 --> 04:28.214
and it's what you told
Scottie--

04:28.299 --> 04:30.600
it's the truth, and just because
she can't see it

04:30.668 --> 04:31.651
doesn't mean
we have to live with it.

04:31.735 --> 04:32.835
No, we don't.

04:32.903 --> 04:34.303
I need you to get in a room
with Ava

04:34.305 --> 04:36.306
and offer our testimony
against Edward

04:36.373 --> 04:39.192
in exchange for taking our names
off the lawsuit.

04:40.644 --> 04:43.513
What about when Scottie
finds out?

04:51.055 --> 04:52.939
Thanks.

05:03.194 --> 05:04.662
11:08.

05:04.713 --> 05:06.664
For being late
to a settlement conference.

05:06.731 --> 05:08.766
Tanner, what the hell are you
doing here, and how the hell

05:08.833 --> 05:10.851
did you insinuate yourself
with Ava Hessington?

05:10.936 --> 05:12.603
- Jealous?
- No, I just thought Hessington

05:12.671 --> 05:15.406
was in the oil business,
not the snake oil business.

05:15.474 --> 05:16.974
Ha ha.
They diversified.

05:17.042 --> 05:19.877
- Where's Ava?
- Ava's not here,

05:19.928 --> 05:21.479
because she's not interested
in your offer

05:21.546 --> 05:22.980
to testify
against Edward Darby.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.431
I'm not the one
who did this to her.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.517
Aren't you? Didn't you pull
your typical bullshit

05:26.585 --> 05:28.202
to get the original attorney
thrown off this case?

05:28.286 --> 05:30.254
- To win the damn case.
- Well, instead of winning it,

05:30.322 --> 05:31.622
it led to Ava being charged
with murder.

05:31.690 --> 05:33.023
A charge I got her off of

05:33.091 --> 05:35.059
by finding the people
who were actually responsible.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.527
Sorry, Harv,
but that's not enough,

05:36.595 --> 05:38.863
and Ava has no intention
of letting you off the hook.

05:38.930 --> 05:41.148
Ava or you?

05:41.233 --> 05:42.933
We both know
you tracked her down

05:42.984 --> 05:44.952
because of your lifelong,
never-gonna-happen dream

05:45.036 --> 05:46.287
to beat me.
I never heard

05:46.371 --> 05:48.122
of Ava Hessington until
she walked through my door.

05:48.206 --> 05:50.040
Bullshit.
You have a subscription

05:50.108 --> 05:51.825
to Harvey Specter monthly,
and I know it.

05:51.910 --> 05:53.661
[Laughing]
Okay, you got me.

05:53.745 --> 05:54.879
I knew exactly who she was

05:54.946 --> 05:56.413
the second she walked
through my door--

05:56.464 --> 05:58.382
my chance to take
your lunch money.

05:58.449 --> 06:01.919
Well, let me make you
an advance payment.

06:01.970 --> 06:04.288
[Coin clattering]
Why don't you use this

06:04.339 --> 06:06.423
to call your mom and tell her
to get the tissues ready,

06:06.474 --> 06:08.175
because you're 0-2
against me,

06:08.260 --> 06:11.862
and the 0 isn't the number
that's going to change.

[Scoffs]
We should have known

06:52.399 --> 06:53.618
Tanner was behind
this whole thing.

06:53.684 --> 06:55.017
According to Tanner,

06:55.085 --> 06:56.725
Ava went to him,
not the other way around.

06:56.770 --> 06:58.821
- You believe that shit?
- Not for a second.

06:58.872 --> 07:00.189
Who am I putting
in the cross hairs,

07:00.257 --> 07:02.375
Tanner or Ava?
At the moment, no one.

07:02.459 --> 07:04.844
Tanner's going to depose me,
then we'll see what we see.

07:04.928 --> 07:07.697
Come on, Harvey,
you got to give me one of them.

07:07.764 --> 07:09.031
You've got to be
kidding me.

07:09.099 --> 07:11.000
You got girlfriend troubles,
don't you?

07:11.067 --> 07:13.336
Okay, I'm just asking
for an assignment, that's all.

07:13.387 --> 07:15.504
Don't tell me, quarterback
asked her to the prom?

07:15.555 --> 07:17.473
Okay, first of all,
I specifically haven't

07:17.524 --> 07:19.275
bothered you with any of this.
Until now.

07:19.343 --> 07:20.776
I was just asking
for an assignment.

07:20.844 --> 07:22.478
Captain Pinstripe's the one
who brought up the girlfriend,

07:22.529 --> 07:24.347
and second of all,
people actually had girlfriends

07:24.414 --> 07:26.549
after high school,
which you wouldn't know,

07:26.616 --> 07:28.351
because emotionally,
you never graduated.

07:28.418 --> 07:29.919
Well, I guess
you're the expert,

07:29.987 --> 07:32.772
because the only thing you
graduated from is high school.

07:35.092 --> 07:36.942
Why you got to go there,
man?

07:39.262 --> 07:41.263
This predicts
a candidate's success rate,

07:41.331 --> 07:43.466
and then this
cross-references it

07:43.533 --> 07:45.501
with your firm's
employment needs.

07:45.568 --> 07:47.803
Wait a second, you're running
two programs at the same time?

07:47.871 --> 07:49.972
Yeah, I don't bend over
backwards for just anyone.

07:50.023 --> 07:51.457
- Hold on to that thought.
- [Chuckles]

07:51.541 --> 07:53.609
In the meantime, I need you
to put this guy on the list.

07:53.677 --> 07:55.127
Uhhuh.
I already did.

07:55.212 --> 07:56.612
Would you
look at this place?

07:56.680 --> 07:58.380
I mean, it's like a war room
in here.

07:58.432 --> 08:02.051
Mmhmm.
Speaking of wartime,

08:02.119 --> 08:04.420
I'm in the mood
to do battle in the bedroom.

08:04.488 --> 08:06.555
- Not now!
- Oh.

08:06.623 --> 08:08.090
Muddles my mind.
I need to focus.

08:08.158 --> 08:10.626
I get it, you want
to keep looking at candidates.

08:10.694 --> 08:11.977
Yeah.

08:12.062 --> 08:14.830
Check out this bad boy
right here.

08:16.133 --> 08:17.666
- Where'd you get this?
- Harvard archives.

08:17.734 --> 08:19.268
Think this guy's
partner material?

08:19.336 --> 08:20.369
I'm ready to go
to the other room.

08:20.437 --> 08:21.670
Thought
that'd do the trick.

08:21.738 --> 08:23.139
We should bring this in,
tape it to the wall.

08:23.206 --> 08:24.767
There's already 50
taped to the ceiling.

08:24.808 --> 08:27.510
You won't be
looking at the ceiling.

08:27.577 --> 08:30.679
You want this guy
to join us?

08:30.747 --> 08:32.914
- We're running out of time.
- Oh.

08:32.982 --> 08:34.350
[Both giggling]

08:34.417 --> 08:36.818
Tanner's deposing Harvey.
We need to talk about it.

08:36.885 --> 08:39.121
- Who's going to handle it?
- I am.

08:39.188 --> 08:40.510
I don't want to step
on your toes,

08:40.557 --> 08:42.491
but don't we want to consider
outside counsel?

08:42.558 --> 08:44.360
We've gone
down that road before.

08:44.428 --> 08:46.195
Turns out Harvey doesn't
play well with others.

08:46.246 --> 08:47.379
Don't I know it.

08:47.464 --> 08:48.531
But I still think
it's a good idea

08:48.598 --> 08:50.466
to have outside counsel
in that room.

08:50.534 --> 08:51.867
I don't think
it's a good idea

08:51.935 --> 08:53.802
to have anyone else
in that room.

08:53.854 --> 08:55.704
So you brought me in here
to tell me

08:55.772 --> 08:57.089
that you don't want me
to be a part of it?

08:57.174 --> 09:00.209
I brought you in here
to tell you to keep your cool.

09:00.277 --> 09:02.645
I appreciate the condescending
words of wisdom, but I've sat in

09:02.712 --> 09:05.347
on about 1,000 depositions
and I've never broken a sweat.

09:05.415 --> 09:08.050
You've never sat in one
with Travis Tanner.

09:08.118 --> 09:09.618
You're gonna need
a thick skin,

09:09.686 --> 09:11.087
'cause he's gonna try
to get under it.

09:11.154 --> 09:12.888
- I'm not the one being deposed.
- Doesn't matter.

09:12.956 --> 09:14.190
Last time he deposed Harvey,

09:14.257 --> 09:16.125
it ended with Harvey
punching him in the face.

09:16.193 --> 09:17.626
That's Harvey, not me.

09:17.694 --> 09:20.096
And if Harvey hadn't done it,
I might have.

09:20.147 --> 09:21.630
What are you talking about?

09:21.681 --> 09:23.532
Tanner knew
all about Harvey's mother.

09:23.600 --> 09:25.434
Came with a whole story
about how I'm Harvey's mother

09:25.502 --> 09:27.970
and what Harvey wants to do
to his mother,

09:28.038 --> 09:31.841
and that story was bullshit.
I get it.

09:31.908 --> 09:34.477
He's not going to need
a bullshit story with me.

09:36.346 --> 09:39.281
Stanford class schedule
and a list of every flight

09:39.332 --> 09:41.350
from here
to Northern California.

09:41.418 --> 09:44.520
I would get a lot of time off,
and it's really not that far.

09:44.588 --> 09:46.489
So I guess this means
you've made your decision.

09:46.556 --> 09:48.224
Mike, I need you
to listen to me.

09:48.291 --> 09:51.794
I love you.
That's over here.

09:51.862 --> 09:53.262
I need to decide
where I want to go to school.

09:53.329 --> 09:55.531
That's over here.
But I want to be with you

09:55.599 --> 09:57.266
no matter what,
and that's in here.

09:57.334 --> 09:58.334
I'm onboard with that,
Rachel,

09:58.401 --> 10:00.903
there's just one problem.

10:00.971 --> 10:02.938
If you say that long-distance
relationships don't work--

10:03.006 --> 10:04.006
I know,
you don't want to hear it.

10:04.074 --> 10:06.142
Because we're not
most people.

10:06.209 --> 10:07.943
I don't know anyone
that has ever

10:08.011 --> 10:10.980
made a long-distance
relationship work.

10:11.047 --> 10:12.915
Do you?

10:15.385 --> 10:20.022
Mike, I need
to be able to breathe

10:20.090 --> 10:21.423
to make this decision.

10:21.491 --> 10:23.725
I'm not the one
that's making it that you can't.

10:23.777 --> 10:26.128
The facts are, but the facts
aren't going to change.

10:26.196 --> 10:30.933
You choose to go to Stanford,
most likely it means we're done.

10:44.848 --> 10:48.918
I don't think you could be
any better than that.

10:48.969 --> 10:52.071
[Chuckles]
It's like you read my mind.

10:52.155 --> 10:53.622
I have a reward for you.

10:53.690 --> 10:55.958
Oh, please, if it's a picture
of me as an astronaut,

10:56.026 --> 10:58.027
I can't right now.
Brian Galloway.

10:58.094 --> 11:01.947
Top of his class, <i>Law Review,</i>
<i>and one cutthroat mother--</i>

11:02.032 --> 11:03.699
Oh, my God,
he's perfect.

11:05.151 --> 11:06.569
You were hiding him
from me?

11:06.636 --> 11:09.305
I've been saving him
for you.

11:09.372 --> 11:15.577
Now, Louis, let's you and I
take the rest of the day off.

11:15.629 --> 11:17.897
- The rest of the day?
- Yeah, we can play hooky.

11:17.981 --> 11:19.498
It'll be fun.

11:19.583 --> 11:24.253
There's a Mastodon exhibit
on loan from Bangkok.

11:24.304 --> 11:25.821
Sheila!
You know that I can't

11:25.889 --> 11:27.122
be unfaithful to my firm
like that.

11:27.190 --> 11:28.924
I mean, it's bad enough
we took a 77-minute break

11:28.992 --> 11:30.793
to do what we just did.

11:30.860 --> 11:33.028
I understand.

11:33.096 --> 11:34.630
You're dedicated
to your work.

11:34.698 --> 11:38.067
It's one of the things
that I admire about you.

11:38.134 --> 11:40.135
Thank you.

11:40.203 --> 11:44.873
In fact, unless you have
any other candidates for me,

11:44.941 --> 11:46.809
I really have to go.

11:51.615 --> 11:53.599
Thank you.

12:00.040 --> 12:01.590
Donna.

12:03.293 --> 12:05.361
Oh, he's not here.

12:05.428 --> 12:07.696
Is there something
that I can help you with?

12:07.764 --> 12:10.115
Come to think of it,
I'm not one for office gossip,

12:10.200 --> 12:13.035
but I have to know.
Are Briscoe and Linhart dating?

12:13.103 --> 12:15.204
Oh, my God,
big time,

12:15.272 --> 12:17.640
and it is drama
with a capital "D."

12:17.707 --> 12:19.141
[Laughs]
I knew it.

12:19.192 --> 12:20.909
What about van Giessen
and Schwarz?

12:20.977 --> 12:24.079
Oh, they were,
but it's done-zo.

12:24.147 --> 12:28.784
Van Giessen thinks Schwarz
got too cozy with Boone.

12:28.852 --> 12:31.053
- Tax law Boone?
- Bankruptcy Boone.

12:31.121 --> 12:33.155
- I thought she was gay.
- No, she's not.

12:33.223 --> 12:35.291
[Laughs] What?
I knew you'd know.

12:35.358 --> 12:36.659
- I always do.
- [Laughs]

12:36.726 --> 12:41.080
How long have Mike Ross
and Rachel Zane been dating?

12:41.164 --> 12:42.931
Um, a few months.

12:42.983 --> 12:47.135
- So it's not casual?
- No, it's not.

12:47.187 --> 12:48.737
Which means
he told Robert Zane's daughter

12:48.805 --> 12:49.971
his secret.

12:50.023 --> 12:51.240
Jessica, I know
what you're thinking--

12:51.307 --> 12:53.609
You have no idea
what I'm thinking.

12:53.660 --> 12:55.828
But for now, I'm thinking
that you're not going to say

12:55.912 --> 12:59.147
anything about this
to either one of them.

12:59.199 --> 13:00.783
And that's not a request.

13:00.834 --> 13:03.168
I won't say a word.

13:11.116 --> 13:12.887
Jesus, you look like shit.

13:12.888 --> 13:14.922
I was up all night.
I couldn't sleep.

13:14.974 --> 13:16.924
I told you I didn't need
anything on Tanner yet.

13:16.992 --> 13:18.710
I'm not here to talk
about Tanner

13:18.794 --> 13:22.096
or the lawsuit or the merger,
I just...

13:23.666 --> 13:24.932
I want to know
how you do it.

13:25.000 --> 13:26.401
How I do what?

13:26.468 --> 13:28.836
Not let people in.

13:28.904 --> 13:30.505
I need to know.

13:30.572 --> 13:32.407
You don't know
what I do and don't do.

13:32.474 --> 13:34.342
What I know is that
you seem to have relationships

13:34.410 --> 13:36.411
again and again
and they don't eat you up

13:36.478 --> 13:39.147
or spit you out
or seem to affect you at all.

13:39.214 --> 13:40.882
I have a picture
of Dorian Gray

13:40.949 --> 13:42.550
hanging in my closet.
It's not funny.

13:42.618 --> 13:44.252
I wasn't joking.
I was trying to get you to leave

13:44.320 --> 13:45.987
so I could have my morning
without you judging me.

13:46.055 --> 13:47.722
Harvey,
I'm not judging you, all right?

13:47.790 --> 13:50.425
I'm just--I just need to know
what your mind-set is.

13:50.492 --> 13:52.927
My mind-set is,
I don't talk about it.

13:52.995 --> 13:54.462
I don't want
to talk about it.

13:54.513 --> 13:58.099
I keep my personal here
and my business over there.

13:58.150 --> 13:59.534
I'm happy
that's working for you,

13:59.601 --> 14:02.403
but it doesn't seem
to be working for me.

14:02.454 --> 14:06.441
I wasn't giving you advice.
I was answering your question.

14:06.508 --> 14:07.942
You want advice,
call Dr. Phil.

14:08.010 --> 14:10.444
Harvey, I'm not trying
to attack you here, okay?

14:10.496 --> 14:12.146
I'm struggling with something.
I just--

14:12.214 --> 14:13.581
I'm trying to get
your take on it.

14:13.649 --> 14:15.183
And I'm not trying to be
defensive, I'm just telling you

14:15.250 --> 14:18.052
I don't know everything
about everything.

14:19.421 --> 14:22.357
Look Mike, you want to know
how to be a lawyer,

14:22.424 --> 14:24.042
I'm your man.

14:24.126 --> 14:26.627
You want to know
how to deal with love,

14:26.695 --> 14:28.963
[chuckles]
That's not my area.

14:29.031 --> 14:31.432
There's coffee made
and bagels in the fridge.

14:31.500 --> 14:33.701
Why don't you
take the morning off?

14:33.752 --> 14:36.637
I've got the deposition.
I got to go.

14:41.777 --> 14:43.378
What the hell happened?

14:43.445 --> 14:45.480
Brian Galloway's weighing offers
from seven different firms.

14:45.547 --> 14:48.249
Eight if you count yours.

14:48.317 --> 14:49.884
Why would you
do that to me?

14:49.935 --> 14:51.296
Is this about
the Mastodon exhibit?

14:51.353 --> 14:53.054
No, you're committed
to your work

14:53.122 --> 14:55.623
as I'm committed to mine,
and unless I'm mistaken,

14:55.691 --> 14:58.526
we never made a professional
commitment to each other.

14:58.594 --> 14:59.961
Sheila,
I don't need a commitment

15:00.028 --> 15:01.662
to know that what we have
is special and unique.

15:01.730 --> 15:05.400
It's not special,
and it's definitely not unique.

15:06.735 --> 15:08.152
Okay, well, then I'm going to
ask you a question,

15:08.237 --> 15:09.971
and I'm only
going to ask it once.

15:10.038 --> 15:11.873
Do you war room
with other firms?

15:11.940 --> 15:13.424
You're a lawyer, Louis.

15:16.612 --> 15:18.880
Don't ask questions
you don't want the answers to.

15:18.931 --> 15:20.815
I'm sorry
you feel that way,

15:20.882 --> 15:22.850
but if you can't handle me
seeing other firms,

15:22.918 --> 15:25.319
then maybe you're not the man
that I thought you were,

15:25.370 --> 15:28.439
and maybe you don't deserve
Brian Galloway.

15:28.524 --> 15:29.907
Deserve him?

15:29.992 --> 15:31.358
You don't get to make
that determination.

15:31.410 --> 15:34.262
Yes, I do.
I'm Sheila Amanda Sazs,

15:34.329 --> 15:36.531
and if I say
you don't deserve him,

15:36.598 --> 15:39.200
you don't get to have him.
I don't care who you are.

15:39.268 --> 15:40.768
If I want him,
I can have him,

15:40.819 --> 15:42.069
and I'm going to take him
six ways from Sunday

15:42.121 --> 15:43.271
and there's nothing you can do
to stop me.

15:43.338 --> 15:44.505
Yes, there is,

15:44.573 --> 15:46.240
because when I'm done
talking to him,

15:46.308 --> 15:48.943
there's no way on earth he'll
end up at Pearson Darby Specter

15:49.011 --> 15:50.111
or whatever bullshit name

15:50.179 --> 15:53.214
you guys are calling yourselves
this week.

15:53.282 --> 15:56.217
Now, get out of my way.
I have a plane to catch.

16:03.659 --> 16:05.793
- You're early.
- So are you.

16:05.861 --> 16:07.462
I should have known
something like this was coming

16:07.529 --> 16:08.830
when you left
without saying a word.

16:08.897 --> 16:10.932
What did you expect,
a fruit basket

16:10.999 --> 16:13.301
for getting me out of a crime
your firm committed?

16:13.368 --> 16:15.169
Ava, I know Travis Tanner
fed you a line

16:15.237 --> 16:16.318
to get your business, but--

16:16.371 --> 16:18.372
Mr. Tanner
didn't feed me anything.

16:18.440 --> 16:21.242
This is the result
of your actions.

16:21.310 --> 16:23.494
Wait a second,
you really did go to him?

16:23.579 --> 16:26.581
I looked into you
when I was deciding to hire you.

16:26.648 --> 16:28.149
You think I wouldn't do
the same thing again

16:28.217 --> 16:29.884
when I decided
to come after you?

16:29.952 --> 16:31.452
When you looked into me,

16:31.520 --> 16:32.820
you found out
that whatever I do

16:32.871 --> 16:35.356
I do it to win, and that's all
I ever did for you.

16:35.424 --> 16:36.991
What you did
was intimidate people

16:37.059 --> 16:39.227
and what it did
was backfire onto me.

16:39.294 --> 16:42.296
Well, now I've found someone
you can't intimidate,

16:42.364 --> 16:44.265
and it's backfiring
onto you.

16:44.332 --> 16:45.967
Now, if you'll excuse me,

16:46.034 --> 16:47.335
I don't need to be here
for this.

16:47.402 --> 16:50.838
So you came here
just to vent at me?

16:50.906 --> 16:53.774
I came here to see
if you were at all sorry

16:53.825 --> 16:55.710
about the way
you handled my case.

16:55.777 --> 16:58.980
I see that you aren't.
Though I imagine you will be

16:59.047 --> 17:01.883
once Mr. Tanner
gets through with you.

17:05.988 --> 17:08.122
Feels like old times.

17:08.190 --> 17:09.891
Lot of good memories
in this room.

17:09.958 --> 17:11.858
Bring back the taste of blood
in your mouth?

17:11.926 --> 17:14.929
Oh, I'm a shark, Harvey.
I love the taste of blood.

17:14.997 --> 17:16.263
Speaking of which,

17:16.330 --> 17:19.016
when you accepted this case,
did you make a side deal

17:19.101 --> 17:20.902
with Edward Darby
where he agreed to make you

17:20.969 --> 17:23.671
managing partner
over Jessica Pearson if you won?

17:23.739 --> 17:25.071
Yes, I did,

17:25.140 --> 17:27.842
but that isn't a side deal.
That's an incentive.

17:27.910 --> 17:29.644
What it is
is a conflict of interest.

17:29.711 --> 17:30.978
That is not true.

17:31.046 --> 17:32.813
If anything, it made Harvey
work harder for Ava.

17:32.881 --> 17:34.482
Whatever gets you
through the night.

17:34.550 --> 17:36.517
The truth is, Edward Darby
doesn't make that deal

17:36.568 --> 17:39.320
unless you have leverage.
You knew Darby couldn't lose

17:39.388 --> 17:41.122
because Stephen Huntley's
murders would be discovered.

17:41.189 --> 17:42.807
Isn't that correct?
No, it isn't.

17:42.891 --> 17:45.459
So prior to her trial
starting, you didn't know

17:45.527 --> 17:47.295
that Stephen Huntley
orchestrated those murders?

17:47.362 --> 17:48.863
- No, I didn't.
- What if I told you

17:48.930 --> 17:51.211
I have evidence that you did?
I'd say you're full of shit.

17:51.266 --> 17:52.466
And whether he knew or not
is irrelevant,

17:52.517 --> 17:54.902
since Edward Darby
stipulated that he knew,

17:54.970 --> 17:56.871
making Mr. Specter liable
anyway.

17:56.939 --> 17:58.339
Oh, it's relevant,

17:58.407 --> 18:00.608
because two days ago,
Mr. Specter tried to cut a deal

18:00.676 --> 18:03.744
to split off from Edward Darby
behind your back.

18:03.812 --> 18:06.247
Oh, I see.
Harvey didn't tell you.

18:06.315 --> 18:07.315
If Harvey had told me,

18:07.382 --> 18:08.849
it wouldn't be going
behind my back,

18:08.900 --> 18:10.217
and I'm not going to blame him
for doing what's in his nature

18:10.285 --> 18:12.205
any more than I'd blame you
for being an asshole.

18:12.220 --> 18:14.789
Ooh.
Feisty and hot.

18:14.840 --> 18:16.480
Now I get why he can't
stay away from you.

18:16.558 --> 18:19.460
Tanner, last time,
Harvey knocked you out.

18:19.528 --> 18:21.629
You don't start acting
like a human being this time,

18:21.696 --> 18:23.030
you're gonna have to deal
with me.

18:23.081 --> 18:24.732
Hey, I'm not the one
who screwed my old girlfriend

18:24.800 --> 18:27.602
while she was engaged.
Kind of a dick move, Harv.

18:27.669 --> 18:28.636
That's enough.

18:28.704 --> 18:30.171
Wait a second.

18:30.238 --> 18:32.073
How come she jumped in,
and you didn't?

18:32.140 --> 18:34.742
She didn't tell you
she was engaged.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.243
Can't trust the hot ones.

18:36.311 --> 18:39.080
Come after me, Tanner.
That's what you're here for.

18:39.147 --> 18:42.450
Oh. I get it.
You actually care about her.

18:44.686 --> 18:47.288
I think I've gotten
everything I need right now,

18:47.356 --> 18:49.790
but since it was so much fun,
I'm going to go ahead

18:49.858 --> 18:52.560
and reserve the right
to do this again.

19:04.206 --> 19:07.174
- Hey, do you have a minute?
- Of course.

19:07.242 --> 19:08.722
Just wondering if maybe
you had a copy

19:08.744 --> 19:10.044
of Harvey's deposition.

19:10.112 --> 19:11.746
Can't you just
get one from Harvey?

19:11.813 --> 19:13.693
I could, but then I wouldn't
be able to show you

19:13.715 --> 19:17.468
how I'm letting you
have all your space.

19:17.552 --> 19:19.453
- This is space?
- Yeah, I mean,

19:19.521 --> 19:20.988
I'm all the way over here,

19:21.056 --> 19:24.959
being all space-giving
and adorable.

19:26.228 --> 19:27.962
As opposed to what
you really want to be doing,

19:28.030 --> 19:30.498
which is looking
at my pros and cons list

19:30.565 --> 19:34.535
for Columbia and Stanford.
No, it actually isn't.

19:34.603 --> 19:36.303
That list is for you.

19:36.371 --> 19:39.707
It's part of your process,
and I'm gonna respect it.

19:39.775 --> 19:42.343
What changed your mind?

19:42.411 --> 19:44.178
I went to see Harvey
this morning.

19:44.246 --> 19:46.347
Harvey gave you advice?

19:46.415 --> 19:47.948
No.

19:48.016 --> 19:51.385
And yes.

19:51.453 --> 19:55.990
I just realized that if I go
his way, I am gonna lose you.

19:56.058 --> 20:00.361
But if I keep going mine,
I'm gonna push you away.

20:00.429 --> 20:04.899
So make your decision,
and I'll give you your space.

20:04.966 --> 20:07.268
Thank you.

20:07.335 --> 20:11.205
You go to Stanford...
We'll beat the odds.

20:18.813 --> 20:20.247
Son of a bitch.

20:20.315 --> 20:21.999
I'm sorry you had to sit
through that personal attack.

20:22.084 --> 20:23.417
Oh, you think
that's what I'm pissed about?

20:23.468 --> 20:25.636
You tried to cut a deal
that would screw Edward

20:25.721 --> 20:26.887
and me in process.

20:26.955 --> 20:29.774
I tried to include you.
You said no.

20:29.858 --> 20:31.242
Oh, you think
that makes it any better?

20:31.326 --> 20:33.660
Scottie, all this is
is Tanner trying to get us

20:33.712 --> 20:34.862
to fight among ourselves.

20:34.930 --> 20:36.597
Well, he's doing
a damn good job of it.

20:36.648 --> 20:38.065
You think he didn't say
some things in there

20:38.133 --> 20:40.484
that got to me too?
Well, I'm not bringing them up,

20:40.569 --> 20:42.486
because right now,
we need to stick together.

20:42.571 --> 20:44.438
Sticking together
means telling the truth,

20:44.489 --> 20:46.407
so tell me, whose idea was it
to cut that deal,

20:46.474 --> 20:48.526
yours or Jessica's?
It was hers,

20:48.610 --> 20:50.027
and I didn't want
to go behind your back

20:50.112 --> 20:51.779
just like you didn't want
to go behind Darby's,

20:51.830 --> 20:55.116
but I did because in the end,
I knew I didn't have a choice.

20:55.167 --> 20:58.652
And neither do you,
you just haven't seen that yet.

21:06.261 --> 21:08.851
- Mike, I need your help.
- Okay, what is it Louis?

21:08.856 --> 21:10.856
I need to you convince
Brian Galloway to come here.

21:10.892 --> 21:12.376
Who?

21:12.460 --> 21:14.511
The top associate candidate
of this year's class.

21:14.596 --> 21:16.396
Stick with me.
Oh, yeah, Brian Galloway.

21:16.464 --> 21:18.265
Harvard,
editor of the <i>Law Review.</i>

21:18.316 --> 21:20.167
Welcome to the conversation.
Please tell me you knew him.

21:20.235 --> 21:21.802
- No, I didn't.
- Damn it!

21:21.870 --> 21:23.904
Louis,
he wasn't my year.

21:23.972 --> 21:25.038
You've already got Katrina.
What's so important

21:25.106 --> 21:26.373
about getting this guy
to come here?

21:26.441 --> 21:28.825
Mike, no, no, no, no, no, no.
It's not about him.

21:28.910 --> 21:30.076
It's about Sheila Sazs.
Oh, yeah?

21:30.128 --> 21:31.895
What about it?
I mean her.

21:31.980 --> 21:33.547
[Scoffs] Mike, come on,
don't be coy with me.

21:33.615 --> 21:35.883
Everyone in New York knows
about our torrid affair.

21:35.950 --> 21:38.185
Yeah, of course.
Torrid.

21:38.253 --> 21:39.753
She had it all set up
for him to come here,

21:39.821 --> 21:41.455
and out of the clear,
blue sky,

21:41.522 --> 21:42.789
she's no longer going to be
exclusive with us.

21:42.857 --> 21:44.524
- There's nothing you did?
- No.

21:44.592 --> 21:47.060
She asked me to take the day
off, I said no.

21:47.128 --> 21:49.062
Next thing I knew she was saying
that our relationship

21:49.130 --> 21:51.732
wasn't special and that
she was free to see other firms.

21:51.799 --> 21:53.734
Okay, Louis, I'm sorry,
but is it possible

21:53.801 --> 21:55.285
that this has nothing to do
with work

21:55.370 --> 21:56.637
and what
she's actually saying

21:56.704 --> 21:59.072
is that she wants
to be exclusive with you?

21:59.140 --> 22:01.441
Oh, Mike, you're so silly.
You know nothing about women.

22:01.509 --> 22:02.989
If she wanted to be
exclusive with me,

22:03.044 --> 22:04.711
she would just come right out
and say it.

22:04.779 --> 22:06.580
Holy shit, it was staring
at me right in the face.

22:06.648 --> 22:08.582
- Not necessarily.
- I've just been using her

22:08.650 --> 22:11.090
for her candidates, I've just
been wham, bam, candidate ma'am.

22:11.119 --> 22:12.452
- Okay.
- I mean, any woman

22:12.520 --> 22:13.520
who's been repeatedly Litt up
would demand

22:13.588 --> 22:14.828
exclusive dominion
over my body.

22:14.856 --> 22:15.989
- Duh.
- Now, get out of my way.

22:16.057 --> 22:17.291
I have a letter to compose.
I'm...

22:17.358 --> 22:19.326
Not in your way.

22:19.394 --> 22:22.079
- Hello, Scottie.
- Tanner.

22:22.163 --> 22:23.830
What are you doing here?

22:23.881 --> 22:25.961
Oh, I just came to bring you
a coffee in the morning.

22:25.967 --> 22:27.768
After meeting you,
I'd say there's an 80% chance

22:27.835 --> 22:30.070
there's a roofie in there.
[Chuckles] No roofie.

22:30.121 --> 22:32.172
Just a skinny vanilla latte
with extra whip

22:32.240 --> 22:34.308
and a shot of caramel.

22:34.375 --> 22:36.176
You looked up
my favorite drink?

22:36.244 --> 22:38.712
It's all
part of the package.

22:38.779 --> 22:40.113
You're here
to split me off from Harvey?

22:40.181 --> 22:41.715
Well, he did
the same to you.

22:41.783 --> 22:43.750
And you wouldn't even know
about it if it weren't for me.

22:43.818 --> 22:45.485
You're a regular
Mother Teresa.

22:45.553 --> 22:48.622
Look, I just came to tell you
that we can take it easy on you

22:48.690 --> 22:50.457
if you'll just maybe say
that Harvey

22:50.525 --> 22:52.326
knew about Stephen Huntley
two months ago.

22:52.393 --> 22:53.760
That would be a lie.

22:53.828 --> 22:56.396
Maybe it would just be
conjecture presented as fact.

22:56.464 --> 22:59.282
Look, I'm gonna say
because you already know it.

22:59.367 --> 23:01.084
I betrayed Harvey once.

23:01.169 --> 23:02.602
It's never going to happen
again.

23:02.670 --> 23:05.138
Okay, well,
then I'll just have to hear

23:05.206 --> 23:07.741
your side of the story
at your deposition.

23:09.610 --> 23:11.345
Ms. Scott,
to your knowledge,

23:11.412 --> 23:13.346
did Harvey Specter
want this merger?

23:13.398 --> 23:14.915
- No, he didn't.
- And did you try

23:14.983 --> 23:16.883
to force it on him
because you'd lost to him

23:16.951 --> 23:18.819
numerous times and you wanted
to get him back?

23:18.886 --> 23:20.737
You're the only one
who's trying to get Harvey back

23:20.822 --> 23:21.989
for losing, Tanner.

23:22.056 --> 23:23.490
And I'm about to be
successful.

23:23.558 --> 23:25.592
Isn't it true
that while you were engaged,

23:25.660 --> 23:27.961
you came to New York
and slept with Harvey Specter

23:28.029 --> 23:29.997
in an attempt to get him
to tell you he loved you

23:30.064 --> 23:31.064
and he said no?

23:31.132 --> 23:32.666
That is utter conjecture.

23:32.734 --> 23:34.067
That's why we have
these depositions,

23:34.135 --> 23:36.336
so I can ask questions
about things I'm conjecturing.

23:36.404 --> 23:38.538
You're not asking questions.
You're throwing mud.

23:38.606 --> 23:40.273
Am I?
The facts are,

23:40.341 --> 23:42.309
you had a relationship with him
in law school,

23:42.377 --> 23:43.543
you worked a case
against him,

23:43.611 --> 23:46.046
and shortly thereafter,
ended your relationship.

23:46.114 --> 23:48.315
It doesn't take a rocket
scientist to connect the dots.

23:48.383 --> 23:49.716
- Tanner--
- Did you really think

23:49.784 --> 23:52.319
that you could domesticate him?
A house in Westchester,

23:52.387 --> 23:54.588
Harvey flipping burgers
on the weekends?

23:54.655 --> 23:56.123
What kind of fantasy land
were you living in?

23:56.190 --> 23:57.424
Tanner, that's enough.

23:57.492 --> 23:58.759
She's not answering
this line of questioning.

23:58.826 --> 23:59.960
Then I'll answer it
for her.

24:00.028 --> 24:02.229
You loved him,
he spurned you,

24:02.296 --> 24:04.798
and you set this whole thing up
to get him back.

24:04.866 --> 24:05.932
That's insane.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.168
Which part?
That you loved him?

24:08.236 --> 24:10.637
That he spurned you?

24:10.705 --> 24:13.173
Nothing?
Wow, I guess they're both true.

24:13.241 --> 24:14.562
We're just not
supposed to believe

24:14.642 --> 24:16.203
that you set this merger up
out of anger

24:16.277 --> 24:17.944
because you knew what was
coming down the pike.

24:18.012 --> 24:19.262
I had no idea
what was coming down the pike.

24:19.347 --> 24:21.248
Oh, so you're telling me
that Edward Darby knew

24:21.315 --> 24:22.582
but his number two
didn't know?

24:22.650 --> 24:24.650
I was not the only one
that Edward Darby relied on.

24:24.652 --> 24:26.787
He relied on Stephen Huntley
for what happened in the E.I.R.,

24:26.854 --> 24:30.557
and they both
kept it from me.

24:30.608 --> 24:32.676
Then why am I holding
this affidavit

24:32.760 --> 24:34.040
with Stephen Huntley's name
on it

24:34.062 --> 24:36.263
stating
you knew everything?

24:36.330 --> 24:38.732
Because he's
a lying son of a bitch,

24:38.800 --> 24:39.933
and you're a piece of shit,

24:39.984 --> 24:42.536
and this is the end
of this deposition.

24:52.146 --> 24:54.765
What you doing?

24:54.849 --> 24:56.650
You know what I'm doing.

24:56.717 --> 24:58.618
If you want to keep
your mind off Rachel,

24:58.686 --> 25:01.621
try reading
Scottie's deposition.

25:01.689 --> 25:02.956
I did.

25:03.024 --> 25:04.491
That must have been
brutal for her.

25:04.559 --> 25:06.693
Must have been brutal
for Harvey.

25:06.761 --> 25:08.912
From what I've seen,
not much is.

25:08.996 --> 25:11.815
Mike, he's not as hard
as you think.

25:14.035 --> 25:15.635
Why are you talking to me
about this?

25:15.703 --> 25:17.637
Because if I asked Harvey
what I'm about to ask you--

25:17.705 --> 25:20.039
He'd say no.

25:20.091 --> 25:21.208
I want to talk to Stephen.

25:21.275 --> 25:23.643
- Donna, not a good idea.
- Mike, please.

25:23.711 --> 25:25.011
I can't just let him hurt
somebody else

25:25.079 --> 25:26.346
and do nothing about it.

25:26.414 --> 25:27.848
So this is just
about protecting Scottie?

25:27.915 --> 25:29.155
I'm not just
protecting Scottie.

25:29.217 --> 25:30.350
I'm protecting Harvey,

25:30.418 --> 25:33.753
because he may not know
how he feels, but I do.

25:33.821 --> 25:36.723
[Buzzer buzzes]

25:39.343 --> 25:41.962
I was told my attorney
was here to see me.

25:42.013 --> 25:45.499
I'm sorry, should have said
"an attorney's here to see you."

25:45.566 --> 25:48.368
You lied, so we lied.

25:48.419 --> 25:53.240
See you got my affidavit.
Well written, wouldn't you say?

25:53.291 --> 25:54.541
So is <i>Lord of the Rings,</i>

25:54.609 --> 25:57.444
but you know what they both are?
Fiction.

25:57.512 --> 25:59.746
What did Tanner offer you
to sign that?

25:59.814 --> 26:01.381
He didn't offer me
anything.

26:01.449 --> 26:03.250
Bullshit.
Tanner's a liar and a snake

26:03.317 --> 26:05.218
and he doesn't do anything
without a reason.

26:05.286 --> 26:06.647
So you say,
but I wouldn't know him

26:06.671 --> 26:08.321
from a hole in the ground.

26:08.389 --> 26:10.056
He came to me
with an opportunity,

26:10.124 --> 26:11.658
and I took it.

26:11.726 --> 26:13.727
How is making up
a load of shit about Dana Scott

26:13.794 --> 26:15.629
an opportunity?
I didn't make up anything.

26:15.696 --> 26:17.497
What I wrote was that
she was the conduit

26:17.565 --> 26:19.015
between Edward and I.

26:19.100 --> 26:21.952
She was my boss.
That is factually correct.

26:22.036 --> 26:25.038
That's a misleading statement
designed to confuse a jury

26:25.106 --> 26:27.307
in your murder trial
so that you can claim

26:27.375 --> 26:30.177
Edward's testimony is a lie.
It is a lie.

26:30.244 --> 26:32.829
We never had the conversation
he said we had.

26:32.914 --> 26:36.950
Mike.
Can you give us a minute?

26:42.690 --> 26:45.125
[Buzzer buzzes]

26:45.176 --> 26:46.643
[Door closes]
You told me I was wrong

26:46.727 --> 26:48.161
about you.
How can you do this?

26:48.229 --> 26:52.365
Donna,
my life is on the line.

26:52.433 --> 26:53.483
So you'll drag
as many people down

26:53.568 --> 26:54.808
as you have to
to save yourself?

26:54.869 --> 26:56.536
Her freedom
isn't at stake.

26:56.604 --> 26:58.271
No,
but her reputation is.

26:58.339 --> 26:59.706
She'll survive.

26:59.774 --> 27:03.610
You're lying about her.

27:03.678 --> 27:06.913
Yeah, I am.

27:08.883 --> 27:12.135
Stephen, I'm gonna
ask you this one more time.

27:12.220 --> 27:16.522
If anything you ever said to me
was true, please don't do this.

27:20.094 --> 27:23.396
I'm sorry, Donna.
I have to.

27:30.771 --> 27:31.904
[Buzzer buzzes]

27:31.956 --> 27:34.624
- You get what we need?
- No, she didn't.

27:34.709 --> 27:36.242
Actually, I did.

27:36.294 --> 27:37.877
What are you talking about?

27:37.929 --> 27:40.297
You might not know this,
but every conversation

27:40.381 --> 27:43.249
in this particular facility
is recorded,

27:43.301 --> 27:45.602
with an exception made
for attorney-client privilege.

27:45.686 --> 27:48.605
And as you pointed out,
we're not your attorneys.

28:00.985 --> 28:01.934
[Door closes]

28:29.282 --> 28:30.360
Jessica.

28:30.385 --> 28:31.625
Were you expecting
someone else?

28:32.060 --> 28:35.412
- I--um--.
- - Nice place. Can I come in?

28:35.463 --> 28:37.014
Yeah, of course.

28:37.081 --> 28:38.549
Do you want some Cheerios?

28:38.617 --> 28:41.318
- What would Cap'n Crunch say?
- Yeah, you're right.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.520
We wouldn't want
to cross him.

28:43.572 --> 28:46.023
I've never seen you wear this
at the office.

28:46.091 --> 28:48.626
Something I should know?
Yeah, that's not-

28:48.693 --> 28:50.895
I know,
and I know whose it is,

28:50.962 --> 28:53.097
and that's exactly why
I'm here.

28:53.164 --> 28:56.267
You told Robert Zane's daughter
my business.

28:56.334 --> 28:58.168
[Sighs]

29:00.872 --> 29:03.440
Look, she's not gonna
tell anyone.

29:03.508 --> 29:06.777
I know.

29:06.828 --> 29:09.647
Because you're going to get her
to sign this.

29:15.887 --> 29:18.088
This puts her in jeopardy.

29:18.156 --> 29:21.892
You put her in jeopardy.

29:21.943 --> 29:25.679
And if I won't do it?

29:25.764 --> 29:28.632
Then you won't be working
for me anymore.

29:30.335 --> 29:32.736
- I got your letter.
- And?

29:32.804 --> 29:34.371
You drafted
a legal document.

29:34.422 --> 29:36.540
That outlines
my exclusivity proposal.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.842
This is
the least romantic thing ever.

29:38.910 --> 29:41.078
You couldn't have the courtesy
to do it in person?

29:41.146 --> 29:43.026
I sent it FedEx, Sheila.
It got there overnight.

29:43.048 --> 29:44.014
P.M. delivery.

29:44.082 --> 29:45.633
A.M. delivery is a scam,
Sheila.

29:45.717 --> 29:47.017
It gets there
at the same time anyway.

29:47.085 --> 29:48.953
Okay, you know what's a scam?
This letter,

29:49.004 --> 29:52.022
which I am now ripping up.

29:52.090 --> 29:53.407
No!
Sheila, please!

29:53.491 --> 29:54.458
[Papers ripping]

29:54.526 --> 29:55.926
I labored over every word
of that.

29:55.994 --> 30:00.831
The time for words is over.
The time for deeds is now.

30:00.899 --> 30:02.733
Well, then give me a deed,
I'll do it.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.368
Give me a mountain,
I'll climb it.

30:04.436 --> 30:06.020
Gimme a Katy Perry song,
I'll sing it.

30:06.104 --> 30:08.339
Your only deed is for you
to get off the phone

30:08.406 --> 30:10.341
and figure out where I'll be
tomorrow night

30:10.408 --> 30:12.843
so you can tell me
what you need to tell me.

30:12.911 --> 30:15.279
Okay, can I just have
some sort of--

30:15.347 --> 30:17.848
[dial tone]
Hello?

30:19.951 --> 30:22.119
Good to see you,
Tanner.

30:22.187 --> 30:23.921
Hello, Harvey.

30:23.972 --> 30:25.622
What do you got
in your hand there?

30:25.690 --> 30:27.210
It's an arrest warrant
for your father.

30:27.225 --> 30:29.860
Turns out he did a little
insider trading a few years ago,

30:29.927 --> 30:31.495
and I pulled some strings.

30:31.563 --> 30:35.532
- [Laughs] Bullshit.
- You're right, I'm lying,

30:35.600 --> 30:37.768
just like Stephen Huntley did
on his affidavit,

30:37.836 --> 30:38.836
and we've got proof.

30:38.903 --> 30:40.604
Well, look who decided
to show up.

30:40.671 --> 30:42.873
I was waiting for you
to get some points on the board.

30:42.941 --> 30:44.221
Now we can start
having some fun.

30:44.275 --> 30:46.477
Nice try, Tanner,
but that affidavit was bullshit,

30:46.544 --> 30:48.946
now you got nothing to back up
your bullshit on Scottie.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.114
You think I need backup?

30:50.165 --> 30:51.815
It wasn't about her.
It was about you.

30:51.883 --> 30:53.617
I'm going to drag her ass
through the mud

30:53.668 --> 30:55.786
left, right, and center,
and when I'm done with her,

30:55.854 --> 30:59.289
there's not a firm that'll
touch her with a 10-foot pole.

30:59.340 --> 31:01.780
What the hell happened to you?
Why are you doing this, Tanner?

31:01.793 --> 31:03.210
I'm doing it for my client.

31:03.294 --> 31:05.162
You actually had me thinking
if we ever met again--

31:05.230 --> 31:06.363
That I'd fight fair?

31:06.431 --> 31:08.866
I do in the ring,
but this isn't the ring,

31:08.933 --> 31:12.202
and you know very well that you
can stop me anytime you want.

31:12.270 --> 31:13.537
If I settle.

31:13.588 --> 31:15.773
There are lot of zeroes
on that offer.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.375
You just need to decide whether
you care more about money

31:18.443 --> 31:21.278
or your girlfriend.

31:35.910 --> 31:38.362
Donna told me that Stephen's
affidavit is dead.

31:38.430 --> 31:41.498
It is, but it doesn't matter,
because Tanner's

31:41.566 --> 31:44.802
gonna keep coming after you
unless we sign this.

31:46.071 --> 31:47.387
You'll never sign this.

31:47.472 --> 31:49.306
Scottie,
you may not believe this,

31:49.374 --> 31:52.042
but if the decision were mine,
I would.

31:52.110 --> 31:54.545
Jessica--
she wouldn't even consider it.

31:54.612 --> 31:56.013
I should have known.

31:56.081 --> 31:58.348
This is about you getting me
to split you off from Edward

31:58.416 --> 32:00.184
so you can convince Ava
to stop coming after you.

32:00.251 --> 32:02.820
- This isn't about that.
- Then what is it about?

32:02.887 --> 32:05.222
I can't stand to see them
come after you.

32:05.290 --> 32:06.530
- Bullshit!
- It's not bullshit.

32:06.591 --> 32:07.724
You think I can't take it!

32:07.792 --> 32:09.476
Look, you're not listening
to me, okay?

32:09.561 --> 32:11.962
I can't take it!

32:12.030 --> 32:14.698
Scottie, Tanner can only
come after you

32:14.765 --> 32:16.567
if Ava lets him
come after you,

32:16.634 --> 32:18.795
and Ava's only letting him
come after you to get to me.

32:18.803 --> 32:20.404
Take off the shackles off
and let me convince her

32:20.472 --> 32:22.573
this fight isn't with me,
it's with Edward.

32:22.640 --> 32:24.641
Okay, Harvey.

32:24.692 --> 32:27.044
Okay, you win.

32:29.614 --> 32:32.382
Shackles are off.

32:32.450 --> 32:34.317
[Knocking at the door]

32:35.370 --> 32:36.870
- Hi.
- Hey.

32:36.955 --> 32:41.141
There's something that I need
to tell you, and...

32:41.226 --> 32:43.861
I really don't want to.

32:43.928 --> 32:47.147
Okay. [Chuckles]
You're scaring me.

32:47.232 --> 32:49.399
Jessica came by my place
this morning.

32:49.467 --> 32:52.402
- She knows about us.
- She does.

32:52.453 --> 32:53.937
Okay.

32:54.005 --> 32:55.639
She says that you're
Robert Zane's daughter,

32:55.690 --> 32:59.409
and if you want
to stay at the firm...

32:59.477 --> 33:02.146
You need to sign
an affidavit.

33:02.213 --> 33:05.599
Saying what?

33:05.683 --> 33:08.552
That you know I'm a fraud.

33:11.089 --> 33:13.457
Well, what if
I don't sign it?

33:13.525 --> 33:15.742
Then she'll fire me.

33:15.827 --> 33:18.946
I don't believe that.
You've got leverage.

33:19.030 --> 33:22.449
No, that just stops her
from exposing me, not firing me.

33:22.534 --> 33:24.785
- Bullshit.
- No, it's not bullshit.

33:24.869 --> 33:27.788
If she fires me, what am I
gonna to do, run to the D.A.?

33:27.872 --> 33:30.073
Have them throw me in jail
just to get her back?

33:30.124 --> 33:33.377
I'm not going to do that,
and she knows it.

33:41.269 --> 33:45.522
Can't stand that I put you
in this position.

33:45.590 --> 33:48.442
And the only way I can see
out of this is...

33:48.526 --> 33:50.811
for you to go to Stanford.

33:53.237 --> 33:56.088
Miss Hessington, when we first met

33:56.745 --> 33:58.779
did you admit
you bribed a foreign government

33:58.847 --> 33:59.847
to get your pipeline?

33:59.915 --> 34:01.382
I pled guilty.

34:01.450 --> 34:03.751
I didn't ask you
what you pled.

34:03.819 --> 34:05.920
I asked if you did it.
That's privileged.

34:05.988 --> 34:08.255
Your client forfeited
privilege when she sued me.

34:08.322 --> 34:09.422
Keep that in mind.

34:09.491 --> 34:10.591
My client's not suing you.

34:10.659 --> 34:12.360
She's suing
Pearson Darby Specter.

34:12.427 --> 34:15.129
There is no
Pearson Darby Specter.

34:15.179 --> 34:16.664
We split.
[Chuckles]

34:16.732 --> 34:18.149
Edward Darby
wouldn't allow that.

34:18.233 --> 34:20.074
Edward Darby doesn't have
the power to stop it.

34:20.135 --> 34:22.536
But I do, and I'm not going to
let you make them suffer

34:22.603 --> 34:25.106
for what Darby did.
Hell of a performance, Harvey.

34:25.172 --> 34:26.574
Back-up singers
and everything.

34:26.641 --> 34:27.757
It's still not
going to stop us.

34:27.842 --> 34:30.177
And he isn't
making them suffer.

34:30.245 --> 34:31.846
I am
for what he did to me.

34:31.914 --> 34:34.649
Did what to you?
Get you a slap on the wrist

34:34.716 --> 34:35.850
for your original
bribery charges,

34:35.918 --> 34:37.818
get you off murder,

34:37.886 --> 34:39.453
or stop you
from bribing witnesses?

34:39.521 --> 34:41.255
Which brings me
to my next question.

34:41.322 --> 34:43.491
Did you fire me
for refusing to bribe witnesses

34:43.542 --> 34:44.824
on your behalf?

34:44.893 --> 34:47.128
- You're under oath.
- Don't answer that.

34:47.195 --> 34:48.963
I wouldn't.
It's a federal crime.

34:49.031 --> 34:50.931
She doesn't have to.
Like I said,

34:50.983 --> 34:53.900
we're not bound by privilege
and I've got three witnesses,

34:53.969 --> 34:55.436
including your friend
Stephen Huntley

34:55.504 --> 34:57.622
who testified to it
in open court.

34:57.706 --> 35:00.708
You want to throw stones, Ava?
We've got some rocks of our own.

35:07.449 --> 35:08.949
What are you doing,
Harvey?

35:09.001 --> 35:10.885
I'm talking to your client
off the record.

35:10.936 --> 35:12.720
No, no, no.
On the record, or not at all.

35:12.788 --> 35:13.955
No, let him speak.

35:14.022 --> 35:17.858
I want to hear
what he's got to say.

35:17.926 --> 35:20.995
Ava, you can come at us
and we can come at you.

35:22.864 --> 35:26.100
I don't want that.

35:26.168 --> 35:29.337
You wanted to know if I'm sorry.
I am.

35:29.404 --> 35:32.506
I'm sorry
I didn't listen to you,

35:32.574 --> 35:34.241
I'm sorry
I didn't believe you,

35:34.309 --> 35:36.844
I am sorry that my history
with Cameron

35:36.912 --> 35:38.412
put a target on your back,

35:38.480 --> 35:41.349
but I am not sorry that I did
everything in my power

35:41.416 --> 35:43.351
to help you
every chance I got.

35:43.418 --> 35:45.519
If you don't believe that,
then keep coming.

35:45.587 --> 35:50.291
But if you do, I'm asking,
put your anger where it belongs.

35:57.899 --> 36:01.819
Tanner, I hope you still have
that quarter I gave you,

36:01.903 --> 36:04.355
'cause I think it's time
to call your mom.

36:04.439 --> 36:07.408
Harvey.

36:07.476 --> 36:10.878
Fantastic.

36:24.459 --> 36:26.060
I hear we won.

36:26.128 --> 36:27.795
We hit a single.
Just kidding.

36:27.862 --> 36:29.714
We knocked the son of a bitch
out of the park.

36:29.798 --> 36:31.866
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations to you.

36:31.933 --> 36:34.335
I hear you're representing
Stephen Huntley now.

36:34.402 --> 36:37.538
Yeah.
Might as well be.

36:37.606 --> 36:39.140
What's that
supposed to mean?

36:39.207 --> 36:41.475
It means we sat and had drinks
when we thought Ava was guilty.

36:41.526 --> 36:43.744
Now Stephen is.
What's the difference?

36:43.812 --> 36:45.880
Guess your morning off
didn't do the trick.

36:45.947 --> 36:48.182
What are we doing here,
Harvey?

36:48.250 --> 36:51.085
We spend every minute
of our lives in this office

36:51.153 --> 36:53.087
fighting with each other
over meaningless shit

36:53.155 --> 36:54.655
for clients
that we don't even know,

36:54.723 --> 36:56.323
and then when some
real connection comes along,

36:56.391 --> 36:58.926
just some little piece
of happiness--

37:08.566 --> 37:10.420
Mike.

37:12.524 --> 37:15.409
I'm sorry.

37:20.549 --> 37:22.583
Did she tell you
what she did?

37:22.650 --> 37:24.819
Rachel?

37:24.886 --> 37:28.489
I guess not.

37:28.557 --> 37:30.257
Jessica's basically forcing her
to go to Stanford

37:30.325 --> 37:32.026
instead of Columbia.

37:32.094 --> 37:33.928
She found out
about you two.

37:33.995 --> 37:36.931
I don't want her to go.

37:36.998 --> 37:39.767
And there's nothing
I can do about it.

37:48.076 --> 37:49.610
Come in.

37:53.148 --> 37:56.951
I want to talk to you about...
This.

37:58.420 --> 37:59.703
I see you haven't
signed it.

37:59.788 --> 38:01.822
No, I haven't.

38:01.890 --> 38:03.958
Then you must want something,
because you wouldn't be here

38:04.025 --> 38:05.659
just to tell me
you weren't going to sign it.

38:05.727 --> 38:07.628
Mike said you were worried
that Robert Zane's daughter

38:07.696 --> 38:11.332
knew his secret, which got me
thinking about my father

38:11.399 --> 38:13.200
and something
he's always said.

38:13.268 --> 38:14.885
- Which is?
- Don't sign anything

38:14.970 --> 38:16.837
unless you can get something
in return.

38:16.905 --> 38:19.540
- It's called consideration.
- I know what it's called.

38:23.995 --> 38:26.263
What do you want?

38:26.348 --> 38:29.316
You want me to guarantee
that I won't do something

38:29.384 --> 38:30.951
that I would never do.

38:31.019 --> 38:32.979
I want you to guarantee
that you will do something

38:33.021 --> 38:37.024
that you thought you would
never do but should do.

38:37.091 --> 38:39.126
I can't wait to hear this.

38:39.194 --> 38:40.354
Waive the Harvard rule
for me.

38:40.395 --> 38:42.663
- You're not even a lawyer.
- But I will be,

38:42.731 --> 38:44.865
and when I am,
I want to work here.

38:44.933 --> 38:46.567
The Harvard rule

38:46.634 --> 38:48.569
is the longest-standing rule
we have.

38:48.636 --> 38:52.356
I have been killing it here
for the better part of a decade.

38:52.440 --> 38:54.608
I'm better than most of
the associates in that bullpen

38:54.676 --> 38:56.877
and I haven't even
gone to law school yet,

38:56.945 --> 38:59.446
so imagine what it'll be like
once I have.

38:59.514 --> 39:01.949
You are
your father's daughter.

39:02.017 --> 39:03.784
Yes, I am.

39:03.852 --> 39:05.402
But I don't want to work
for him.

39:05.487 --> 39:08.322
I want to work for you.

39:12.227 --> 39:13.427
[Both laughing]

39:13.494 --> 39:15.062
To kicking
Travis Tanner's ass.

39:15.113 --> 39:19.300
You got that right.
[Laughs]

39:19.367 --> 39:23.254
Mmm.
A pretty great meal.

39:23.338 --> 39:25.339
Couldn't have done it
without you.

39:25.406 --> 39:27.808
I know, I taught you
how to make it.

39:27.876 --> 39:30.544
Right after we crushed
the bar.

39:30.612 --> 39:34.515
[Chuckles] I also remember
what happened later that night.

39:34.582 --> 39:37.484
It was
a pretty great night.

39:40.005 --> 39:43.257
Harvey.

39:43.325 --> 39:44.692
Why am I here?

39:44.759 --> 39:48.028
Well, I haven't cooked
anyone dinner for a while,

39:48.096 --> 39:49.930
and I thought you deserved it.
I did,

39:49.998 --> 39:51.565
but you've made it clear
that you don't want more,

39:51.633 --> 39:54.635
and I don't want to go back
to the way it was, so...

39:54.703 --> 39:57.537
I want to work with you.

39:58.607 --> 40:01.375
What?

40:01.442 --> 40:03.978
You've been associated
with the name Darby too long.

40:04.045 --> 40:05.212
I can help you.

40:05.280 --> 40:06.830
I don't need your help.
I'll be fine.

40:06.915 --> 40:08.949
No, you won't,
and all that stuff about Tanner

40:09.017 --> 40:11.051
coming after you and me
not being able to take it,

40:11.102 --> 40:13.187
it was true.
I care about you.

40:13.255 --> 40:16.790
Come to Pearson Specter.
I know that you care about me.

40:16.858 --> 40:18.392
You have made that
very clear,

40:18.460 --> 40:19.760
but I am not interested

40:19.828 --> 40:21.468
in working with someone
day in and day out

40:21.496 --> 40:24.598
where all they can manage to say
is, "I care about you."

40:24.666 --> 40:26.033
- Is that all I've ever said?
- Actually, yes,

40:26.101 --> 40:28.936
over and over again,
"I care about you."

40:28.987 --> 40:30.704
Just what every girl
wants to hear.

40:30.772 --> 40:33.173
- Scottie, that's--
- No, no, no.

40:39.180 --> 40:40.581
If all you want to do
is work with me,

40:40.649 --> 40:42.249
I can find a job
somewhere else.

40:42.300 --> 40:44.218
It's the best I--

40:46.121 --> 40:47.888
Sorry, I should just go.
I don't--

40:47.955 --> 40:53.027
Scottie,
that's not all I want.

40:53.094 --> 40:56.330
Then say it.

40:56.398 --> 40:58.632
I want you in my life.

41:05.607 --> 41:08.442
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:08.510 --> 41:10.177
Thought you didn't like
coming down here.

41:10.245 --> 41:14.014
- Can I come in?
- Yeah, of course.

41:24.642 --> 41:27.661
I finished my list.

41:27.729 --> 41:29.129
And?

41:29.197 --> 41:32.399
Stanford.

41:32.467 --> 41:35.703
It's the better fit.

41:35.770 --> 41:37.171
Rachel, look--

41:43.244 --> 41:45.612
I don't need a list
to tell me

41:45.680 --> 41:48.499
that I don't want to be
without you.

41:51.653 --> 41:53.087
You're staying?

41:53.154 --> 41:55.021
Just try and stop me.

42:00.628 --> 42:01.995
- You were messing with me.
- [Laughs]

42:02.047 --> 42:03.130
- You got me.
- I got...

42:03.181 --> 42:04.331
You!
You got me!

42:04.399 --> 42:07.267
[Both giggling]

42:18.279 --> 42:19.813
How did you find me?

42:19.864 --> 42:23.550
You're like me,
a gladiator of your profession,

42:23.618 --> 42:27.054
and...
This is your arena.

42:30.358 --> 42:36.263
This place has every
Harvard law student file ever.

42:36.331 --> 42:38.632
It's like home for me.

42:38.683 --> 42:43.036
And...It's where
you wanted me to say...

42:43.104 --> 42:47.341
Sheila Amanda Sazs,
I want to be exclusive with you.

42:48.910 --> 42:51.044
And I want to be exclusive
with you.

42:51.112 --> 42:54.415
Yes.

42:54.482 --> 42:56.827
Yes.

42:58.787 --> 43:01.488
A thousand times yes.

43:03.741 --> 43:05.526
We're gonna make love.
And eat this picnic.

43:05.593 --> 43:07.127
In no particular order.

43:07.178 --> 43:10.197
Wait.
First, I'm gonna call my mother.

43:10.265 --> 43:11.598
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

43:11.666 --> 43:13.117
To tell her the good news?

43:13.201 --> 43:15.068
To tell her
you stopped being a pussy.

43:15.136 --> 43:19.406
Do not touch
any of the files in here.

43:19.457 --> 43:21.041
- Will you smack me if I do?
- Louis,

43:21.109 --> 43:23.110
this is not a joke.

43:23.178 --> 43:25.979
You're not even
supposed to be in here.

43:45.517 --> 43:48.635
For the love of God,
forgive me, Sheila.

43:50.071 --> 43:51.321
You gotta be kidding me.

43:51.406 --> 43:55.576
Harvey Specter.
[Laughs]

43:55.643 --> 43:57.528
What a douche.

43:57.612 --> 43:59.530
Mike Ross.

44:01.583 --> 44:04.668
R-o, r-o, r-o.
"R-o."

44:08.823 --> 44:14.044
"Richardson...
Jerry Ross"...

44:14.128 --> 44:17.047
Mike Ross.
What the hell?

44:21.803 --> 44:24.721
He's not here.
