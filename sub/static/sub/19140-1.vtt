01:17.920 --> 01:19.990
Now...

01:20.040 --> 01:23.316
for reasons that will soon become crystal clear,

01:23.360 --> 01:25.590
no detail of what you see and hear this week

01:25.640 --> 01:27.870
must ever become public knowledge.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.632
Gentlemen,

01:31.680 --> 01:35.116
this job has always been,
and must always remain,

01:36.040 --> 01:38.508
the most closely guarded of secrets.

01:56.280 --> 01:58.953
The prisoner is first brought
into this lobby area.

01:59.000 --> 02:02.470
Aye aye... That's thoughtful, isn't it?

02:02.800 --> 02:04.438
Hook to hang their coat on.

02:05.240 --> 02:07.276
Mind you, they won't need it afterwards!

02:07.920 --> 02:09.638
Settle down.

02:10.759 --> 02:12.990
So then, this is the lobby area.

02:14.760 --> 02:15.988
With coat hooks.

02:17.760 --> 02:18.749
Then...

02:18.800 --> 02:20.199
through this door...

02:21.160 --> 02:22.513
...their cell.

02:30.560 --> 02:32.551
The only one like it in the prison.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.638
It will be their home
for a minimum of three Sundays

02:36.680 --> 02:38.671
from the day of sentence.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.790
That's the law.

02:40.840 --> 02:42.956
This is where the prisoner eats,

02:43.000 --> 02:44.911
sleeps, and waits.

02:45.880 --> 02:49.350
Waits for one fine morning, nine o'clock...

02:50.480 --> 02:52.675
...when one of you
comes through that door.

02:54.240 --> 02:55.719
Now, when you do...

02:56.880 --> 02:59.189
...he'll be sitting here.

02:59.240 --> 03:01.470
As you enter, he'll stand up,

03:01.520 --> 03:04.159
and instinctively turn,
and take a step towards you.

03:05.240 --> 03:08.357
He's thinking you'll lead him
back out onto the landing.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.311
That, gentlemen,
is where you've got him.

03:10.360 --> 03:13.079
In those few seconds,
you take his left hand with your right,

03:13.120 --> 03:15.839
spin him, pinion him,
and lead him back out that way.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.511
He'll be confused by this.

03:20.880 --> 03:22.393
And disorientated.

03:24.360 --> 03:25.952
But he'll not be scared.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.110
He knows what's out there.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.550
Just a door to a courtyard.

03:32.600 --> 03:33.999
And a wall.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.591
And Mr Sykes' coat hooks on it.

03:38.800 --> 03:41.598
Mr Cooper,
would you push back that door, please?

03:51.760 --> 03:53.796
So, what do we do? We exploit it.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.998
We get him in here and dropped

03:56.040 --> 03:59.237
before he's had time
to recover from the shock.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.589
Before he can struggle or fight,

04:01.640 --> 04:03.835
and before he even knows what's happening.

04:04.960 --> 04:09.909
No sense in prolonging the agony.
For him or for you.

04:18.320 --> 04:21.392
The heavier the man,
the shorter the drop you give him.

04:21.760 --> 04:24.718
The weaker the neck, the shorter the drop.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.359
Get it wrong,
and you'll pull his head off.

04:28.400 --> 04:29.389
Pierrepoint...

04:29.480 --> 04:31.835
Male, 24 years old, 5ft 6.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.598
160lb in his clothes.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.074
- Occupation?
- Manual labourer.

04:36.600 --> 04:38.750
A good strong neck...

04:38.800 --> 04:41.792
Table says 6ft 3. I'd give him 6ft 11.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.674
So would I. Good.

04:45.640 --> 04:46.629
Very good.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.270
Oh, Mr Pierrepoint.

05:21.320 --> 05:24.471
Well, this is a surprise.
We weren't expecting you till next week.

05:24.520 --> 05:26.431
No, no, I was just passing.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.233
I finished my round a little early, and, well...

05:31.920 --> 05:33.512
...here I am.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.551
Well, that's nice.

05:36.280 --> 05:38.191
I was...

05:39.840 --> 05:42.308
Fetch some more paper bags
out of the back, Alice.

05:46.400 --> 05:48.231
Now, please.

05:53.160 --> 05:58.188
Actually... I did have a special reason
for calling today, Miss Fletcher.

05:59.320 --> 06:01.231
Only, I was wondering, like...

06:02.400 --> 06:05.676
Pierrepoint. We don't have a delivery today.

06:06.880 --> 06:08.393
No. I er...

06:08.440 --> 06:09.634
No.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.957
No, I just came in for some pipe tobacco.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.912
Yeah, can I have a half ounce
of Ready Rub, please,

06:14.960 --> 06:16.473
and a box of Swans, thank you.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.678
And don't keep my staff chatting. They're busy.

06:19.960 --> 06:22.076
Right, Mr Sellers. Aye.

06:24.240 --> 06:26.310
- I just wanted to...
- That'll be one and two.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.036
Mr Sellers, I can't find any bags.

06:36.960 --> 06:39.394
I'd love to. How about the pictures?

06:39.840 --> 06:41.114
Saturday night.

06:41.200 --> 06:44.158
I'll see you outside Churches at seven.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.111
Saturday night.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.908
That lass sends her regards.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.951
You know Annie? Miss Fletcher.

07:15.320 --> 07:17.311
Aye, works in the sweet shop, she does.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.471
Why now, Albert? Why start now?

07:51.200 --> 07:53.031
It's just in me.

07:53.960 --> 07:56.235
I always knew it would come out some day.

07:57.040 --> 07:58.678
You'll have no luck, Albert.

08:00.320 --> 08:01.958
Not as long as you live.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.275
And I'll say to you what I said to your father.

08:06.880 --> 08:09.269
You don't bring it over that threshold.

08:13.200 --> 08:15.191
I'll let you get on with it, then.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.109
I've been accepted, Uncle Tom.

08:33.159 --> 08:35.196
Your dad would have been proud of you.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.071
No doubt about that.

08:37.679 --> 08:40.318
It's what he wanted.
Another Pierrepoint on the list.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.587
They've offered me a job.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.995
Strangeways Prison, Anthony David Farrow.

08:45.880 --> 08:46.869
Tuesday, 26th.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.028
What's the matter?

08:52.120 --> 08:53.917
I'm going to be assisting.

09:14.560 --> 09:16.357
He don't look much, he don't.

09:23.600 --> 09:27.309
I've got 6ft 6 in my mind,
but I'll have to look it up in my book.

09:36.040 --> 09:38.110
We'll use this one.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.230
Less stretch in it.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.077
Like old Andrews said,

09:43.040 --> 09:45.952
only thing we want to stretch tomorrow
is me laddo's neck.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.074
Eh, Albert?

09:48.640 --> 09:49.629
Stand clear.

10:03.840 --> 10:05.637
Seems to be working.

10:06.240 --> 10:08.435
Come on, let's get some tea down us.

10:15.240 --> 10:16.639
Eight hours,

10:17.960 --> 10:19.757
20 minutes, Albert.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.677
That's all he's got left.

10:27.280 --> 10:28.998
Ticking away.

10:32.160 --> 10:34.151
He gets involved with some old tart.

10:37.080 --> 10:38.911
She pushes him over the edge.

10:40.560 --> 10:43.950
He winds up in here waiting for us
to come knocking on his door.

10:47.320 --> 10:49.311
Doesn't bear thinking about, does it?

10:52.080 --> 10:54.196
I wonder if he's looking at his watch.

10:57.000 --> 10:58.991
I don't think 6ft 6 is enough.

11:00.440 --> 11:02.829
He's a slight lad,
but he's stronger than he looks.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.996
I think you should give him 6ft 8.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.270
6ft 6, 6ft 8...

11:10.360 --> 11:12.351
It doesn't really matter, does it?

11:15.960 --> 11:17.951
Either way, he's going down.

12:01.800 --> 12:04.473
God forgive me,
God forgive me, God forgive me...

12:10.080 --> 12:11.308
God forgive me...

12:27.880 --> 12:29.279
Please...

12:31.200 --> 12:32.189
Help me.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.799
Follow me.

13:09.120 --> 13:09.950
Please...

13:12.440 --> 13:13.793
Wait, wait.

13:14.760 --> 13:15.875
Please.

13:42.960 --> 13:44.996
What have we just done, eh?

13:45.040 --> 13:46.996
We've just killed a man, just like that.

13:47.040 --> 13:50.032
- Very bad.
- You don't want to think of it like that.

13:50.680 --> 13:53.478
Think of it as... Well, think of it as...

13:53.520 --> 13:55.511
I'm Albert again, you're Charlie.

13:55.560 --> 13:57.516
We're just the same as we were yesterday.

13:57.560 --> 14:00.677
Yeah, but it won't ever be
the same again, will it?

14:00.720 --> 14:03.678
Not after what we've just done. Eh?

14:03.720 --> 14:06.029
Here. You done all the work.
You have my money too.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.753
- There's no need.
- Go on, you take it. I don't want it.

14:09.960 --> 14:11.757
All right? I don't want it.

14:48.680 --> 14:50.989
I've done you a nice chop.

14:51.040 --> 14:52.712
I'll warm it up for you.

15:47.760 --> 15:48.749
Pork chop.

15:49.560 --> 15:50.754
Your favourite.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.951
Don't be too late up.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.557
Mrs Pierrepoint, can you help me out
with this stocktake tonight?

17:12.599 --> 17:16.752
I know it's Alice's turn, but
she's insisting on going out with the WVS

17:16.800 --> 17:18.313
collecting pots and pans.

17:18.359 --> 17:20.271
It's for t'war effort.

17:20.319 --> 17:23.915
This shop turning a profit -
that's for the war effort too, you know.

17:23.960 --> 17:28.476
I don't mind, Mr Sellers.
Mr Pierrepoint is away tonight anyway, so...

17:28.520 --> 17:29.999
What, again?

17:30.040 --> 17:31.951
Where does he go on these trips?

17:37.400 --> 17:39.391
Private business, Mr Sellers.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.316
Oh, yes.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.112
Yes, of course.

17:44.160 --> 17:45.957
Thank you, Mrs Pierrepoint.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.438
8ft 6.

18:24.840 --> 18:26.751
Two old ladies she killed.

18:26.800 --> 18:30.031
Got them to make out their wills to her,
then gave them morphine.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.392
Did she?

18:53.560 --> 18:55.437
Follow me.

19:17.400 --> 19:19.072
Oh, God, please help me.

19:29.680 --> 19:31.079
Please help me.

19:52.720 --> 19:56.633
14 and a half seconds, Pierrepoint.
Most satisfactory.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.398
Thank you, sir.

19:58.440 --> 20:01.079
I do try to take a pride in my work.

20:01.120 --> 20:04.510
- I don't believe there's a quicker man on the list.
- I'm sure there is not.

20:06.080 --> 20:07.274
Oh, no.

20:08.760 --> 20:12.992
Now, am I mistaken, or did the prisoner
speak on the scaffold?

20:13.040 --> 20:14.871
Not that I was aware of, sir.

20:15.960 --> 20:18.554
Funny. I thought I heard her say something.

20:19.400 --> 20:20.071
No, sir.

20:22.960 --> 20:25.633
- She did say something, didn't she?
- Aye.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.832
She asked for her god.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.998
That's nowt to do with me or anybody else.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.713
It's between her and her executioner.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.558
When I walk into that cell...

20:46.680 --> 20:48.671
...I leave Albert Pierrepoint outside.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.072
I never mix the two.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.950
You have to be clear about these things.

20:56.280 --> 20:59.352
People are always wondering
whether it's possible to take a life,

20:59.400 --> 21:00.958
and it not affect you.

21:01.800 --> 21:03.756
Written bloody books on it.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.439
- What do they say?
- I don't know.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.313
It's not me taking their life.

21:14.600 --> 21:17.956
It's the government wants these people
executed, not you or me.

21:19.960 --> 21:22.076
It's the way I see it.

21:23.560 --> 21:26.393
I never concern myself with what they've done.

21:26.720 --> 21:28.472
It doesn't matter to me.

21:29.560 --> 21:30.834
Right, bring her down.

21:36.280 --> 21:38.589
Grand. Right...

21:50.720 --> 21:51.948
Nice and clean.

21:53.640 --> 21:55.437
Second and third vertebrae.

21:56.520 --> 21:58.750
You see, we don't hurt 'em, Kirky.

21:59.680 --> 22:00.669
Instant.

22:01.960 --> 22:03.757
A professional job, well done.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.992
She wouldn't have felt anything.

22:08.920 --> 22:10.512
Right, lower her down.

22:13.080 --> 22:14.877
That's it, that's it. All right.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.917
Right, take it away.

22:33.440 --> 22:35.954
It's not so much the execution.

22:36.000 --> 22:38.275
It's this bit I hate, Albert.

22:38.320 --> 22:40.788
Why can't someone from the mortuary do this?

22:40.840 --> 22:42.717
Because they wouldn't take care of her.

22:44.120 --> 22:45.314
She paid the price.

22:47.640 --> 22:49.039
She's innocent now.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.231
- Good evening, Albert.
- Aye, aye.

23:03.880 --> 23:05.757
Excuse me, lad.

23:05.800 --> 23:08.109
- Hello, love.
- Are you gonna sing for us?

23:08.160 --> 23:10.276
- Give us a chance. I'm parched.
- Over here.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.348
- Hello, Tosh.
- Hello, Tish lad.

23:14.120 --> 23:16.953
- Hello, Wack.
- I didn't think we were gonna see you tonight.

23:17.000 --> 23:19.195
I nearly didn't make it. I've had a busy day.

23:19.400 --> 23:21.595
Couldn't find us a tin of Spam off your lorry?

23:21.640 --> 23:25.349
Of course. It's just a matter
of timing and temperature, Percy.

23:25.480 --> 23:26.879
When hell bloody freezes over.

23:28.560 --> 23:31.358
Get that down you.
Get the old vocal chords loosened up.

23:33.280 --> 23:35.635
Right, then, Tish lad, let me have a little think.

23:35.920 --> 23:38.195
I like to think about things, Tosh.

23:38.240 --> 23:40.435
Do you know what I thought about
the other day?

23:40.480 --> 23:43.153
What if a person's brains
was made of gunpowder?

23:44.440 --> 23:45.873
You thought about that, Tish?

23:45.920 --> 23:49.435
Yes, I did, and then I stopped
thinking about it in case it were true.

23:51.640 --> 23:53.471
Well, I wouldn't worry, Tish lad.

23:53.520 --> 23:55.795
There's not enough in there to blow your hat off.

23:56.600 --> 23:57.953
How about this one?

23:59.520 --> 24:00.555
# There was a man

24:01.800 --> 24:03.199
# His name was Rouse

24:03.720 --> 24:05.472
# He had the key

24:05.520 --> 24:07.431
# To every house

24:07.560 --> 24:09.391
# He was suspected

24:09.840 --> 24:11.637
# And then arrested

24:12.200 --> 24:14.873
# For making whoopee

24:16.960 --> 24:19.110
# Another bride

24:19.160 --> 24:20.388
# Another groom

24:21.280 --> 24:24.477
# Another sunny honeymoon

24:25.600 --> 24:27.511
# Another season

24:27.560 --> 24:29.437
# Another reason

24:29.480 --> 24:31.391
# For making whoopee

24:32.680 --> 24:33.908
Turn your eyes away.

24:43.840 --> 24:47.037
- You didn't tell me you could sing.
- Jessie. You came.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.115
Said I would, didn't I?

24:48.160 --> 24:50.390
Yeah, I'm so glad you came.

24:51.200 --> 24:52.792
Isn't she lovely, Tosh?

24:53.600 --> 24:55.795
- This is Jessie Kelly, my...
- Acquaintance.

24:55.840 --> 24:56.795
Yes.

24:56.880 --> 24:59.314
And this is Tosh, my partner in crime.

25:00.120 --> 25:02.076
- Pleased to meet you.
- And you.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.068
What can I get you?

25:04.120 --> 25:06.680
No, you're all right. I get my own drinks.

25:07.360 --> 25:10.238
You stay here with your pals.
Making whoopee.

26:01.040 --> 26:02.029
Oh, God.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.791
- What's that with the bandages?
- Suicide bid.

26:18.840 --> 26:21.434
Smashed his arm through a window,
slashed his wrist.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.231
He's in here for killing his girlfriend.

26:25.080 --> 26:27.355
Says he just wants
to get it over and done with.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.278
Well...

26:31.320 --> 26:32.833
we'll do our best, Georgie.

26:32.880 --> 26:33.915
5ft 6.

26:35.240 --> 26:37.800
I was assistant to Duggie Ford on my last job.

26:37.880 --> 26:39.791
Oh, aye? That's it.

26:43.560 --> 26:44.549
Yeah.

26:45.560 --> 26:47.516
Geezer in Strangeways.

26:47.560 --> 26:50.597
- Gangland murder.
- How'd it go?

26:50.640 --> 26:52.278
Not too bad.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.914
A bit jittery was Ford.
But he done all right.

26:54.960 --> 26:58.157
Fast with it. They said 16 seconds after.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.472
Right.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.636
Here's the sandbag.

27:03.680 --> 27:05.318
Let it stretch overnight.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.710
Reckons he's in with a shout
of being number one, does old Fordy.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.599
Does he, now?

27:13.560 --> 27:15.471
Now, pay attention, Georgie.

27:16.640 --> 27:18.358
Tomorrow morning,

27:18.400 --> 27:20.914
I'm going to pull this pin half out.

27:22.600 --> 27:24.955
But just enough to make it catch.

27:25.000 --> 27:27.434
It'll make it easy to whip it out quickly.

27:28.360 --> 27:30.510
So I want you off them traps like lightning.

27:30.560 --> 27:34.712
I'll be quick for you, Albert, I promise.
We're a good partnership, aren't we?

27:36.240 --> 27:38.435
I want to bust 13 seconds tomorrow, Georgie.

27:44.520 --> 27:46.317
That was my father's average.

29:31.760 --> 29:34.149
Seven and a half seconds. That's a record.

29:40.360 --> 29:44.148
I don't mind telling you, Pierrepoint,
I don't think there's a better man in the country.

29:47.200 --> 29:48.918
Thank you, sir.

30:15.720 --> 30:17.711
Seven and a half seconds, Georgie.

30:19.440 --> 30:23.513
Never seen anything like it...
in the history of capital punishment.

30:24.680 --> 30:28.150
I don't think Ford or any of the other buggers
will be getting a look in now.

30:29.760 --> 30:31.273
All I can say is, Georgie...

30:36.320 --> 30:38.311
...your fella Maximovsky got his wish.

30:52.160 --> 30:53.149
<i>They're off.</i>

30:57.200 --> 30:58.189
<i>Flanagan here.</i>

30:59.040 --> 31:01.918
<i>- What the devil are you doing?
- I don't know. He won't go.</i>

31:01.960 --> 31:03.951
<i>You couldn't ride a rocking horse.</i>

31:04.000 --> 31:05.991
<i>I'll make you apologise for that, you cad.</i>

31:07.960 --> 31:11.430
<i>Neck and neck, 30 yards to go.
Ten yards to go. At the post, Canteen wins.</i>

31:11.480 --> 31:12.629
<i>Well, what did I tell you.</i>

31:13.960 --> 31:16.793
<i>Magnificent, Flanagan.
I apologise for everything I said.</i>

31:37.200 --> 31:39.998
<i>The Belsen war criminals
arrive at Lüneburg for trial.</i>

31:41.040 --> 31:44.191
<i>Their faces give little clue
to what they're thinking.</i>

31:44.240 --> 31:47.630
<i>Last out of the lorry is Josef Kramer,
the Beast of Belsen.</i>

31:48.560 --> 31:51.199
<i>The calm orderliness of the scene
contrasts violently</i>

31:51.240 --> 31:53.754
<i>with the ghastly pictures
which shocked the country</i>

31:53.800 --> 31:55.916
<i>when they were shown in British newsreels.</i>

31:59.160 --> 32:02.197
<i>More than four million men,
women and children</i>

32:02.240 --> 32:05.118
<i>were scientifically murdered by gassing.</i>

32:05.800 --> 32:09.475
<i>In this camp, the SS women, led by Irma Grese,</i>

32:09.520 --> 32:12.751
<i>had their victims
torn to pieces by savage dogs.</i>

32:13.600 --> 32:16.990
<i>Pregnant women
went straight to the gas chamber.</i>

32:17.040 --> 32:19.190
<i>Everything done with hideous precision.</i>

32:19.240 --> 32:22.949
<i>The prisoners have been provided
with Allied officers as defence council.</i>

32:23.000 --> 32:27.391
<i>Next to Kramer sits Doctor Fritz Klein,
German medical officer at Belsen,</i>

32:27.440 --> 32:29.317
<i>a man with a loaded conscience.</i>

32:29.640 --> 32:32.234
<i>After 12 years of Nazi thuggery,</i>

32:32.280 --> 32:35.511
<i>one wonders what the Germans think
of British justice.</i>

32:35.560 --> 32:37.755
<i>They may well mistake fairness for weakness.</i>

32:51.400 --> 32:54.312
- Hello, Tosh.
- Hello, Tish.

32:54.360 --> 32:57.352
Annie, this is Tish, that young songbird
I was telling you about.

32:57.400 --> 32:59.436
- Very pleased to meet you.
- How do you do?

33:01.560 --> 33:03.039
Did you enjoy the flick, then?

33:03.080 --> 33:04.798
Aye. It was very comical, wasn't it?

33:04.840 --> 33:08.799
Aye. You've got to laugh, haven't you?
They're my favourite, The Crazy Gang.

33:08.840 --> 33:12.071
I don't know why.
Grown men playing silly buggers, if you ask me.

33:13.920 --> 33:17.230
I'm sorry, Mrs Pierrepoint.
This is Jessie, my lady friend.

33:17.280 --> 33:19.874
Yes, yes, we've met before.

33:21.880 --> 33:24.952
Well, perhaps you'd like to join us?
We're going for a drink.

33:25.720 --> 33:29.793
- Well, aye...
- I think we have to be getting back, really.

33:29.880 --> 33:30.790
Aye.

33:30.840 --> 33:32.637
Well, maybe another time, then, eh?

33:35.360 --> 33:38.113
- Or maybe not.
- Don't be like that, Jessie.

33:38.160 --> 33:41.232
I don't know why you're creeping round them.
They've no time for you.

33:41.280 --> 33:43.111
Well, I've no time for them.

33:44.080 --> 33:44.796
Jessie.

33:48.120 --> 33:49.109
Jessie.

33:50.080 --> 33:52.514
Talk about brazen.

33:52.560 --> 33:54.516
Just walking out with him, bold as brass.

33:54.600 --> 33:58.479
- It's nothing to do with us, is it?
- Oh, it's not right, Albert.

33:58.520 --> 34:01.751
I mean,
she's got a husband and two children.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.358
It's not right.

34:14.639 --> 34:15.629
Annie?

34:16.840 --> 34:18.239
Are you awake?

34:20.080 --> 34:21.991
What is it, love?

34:24.639 --> 34:26.551
Well, it's just...

34:28.600 --> 34:30.397
...something I want to tell you.

34:32.719 --> 34:35.280
Can it not wait till morning?

34:35.320 --> 34:36.911
No, it's important.

34:42.639 --> 34:44.312
It's about what I do...

34:45.800 --> 34:47.438
...when I go away.

34:48.199 --> 34:49.792
You know, the letters.

34:53.880 --> 34:55.518
I know what you do, Albert.

34:58.640 --> 35:00.631
- You know that...
- I worked it out.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.671
Why didn't you say?

35:09.200 --> 35:10.997
Well, I...

35:12.280 --> 35:14.191
...I wanted to hear it from you.

35:55.880 --> 35:57.791
Ah, Pierrepoint.

35:59.440 --> 36:02.557
I suppose you're wondering why
you've been dragged down to London.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.079
It had crossed my mind, sir, yes.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.475
I'm afraid you'll have to
blame the Field Marshal.

36:06.520 --> 36:08.715
Pierrepoint, this is Field Marshal Montgomery.

36:09.680 --> 36:11.750
No. Monty?

36:11.800 --> 36:14.109
- Aye.
- What did he say?

36:14.200 --> 36:15.599
Well...

36:15.640 --> 36:17.596
He said...

36:17.640 --> 36:19.790
He looked me in the eye, and he said,

36:19.840 --> 36:24.868
"The eyes of the world are on us,
Mr Pierrepoint. After what the Nazis..."

36:24.920 --> 36:26.956
After what the Nazis did at Belsen,

36:27.000 --> 36:28.831
I think it's important to show

36:28.880 --> 36:32.236
that British justice is firm but fair.

36:32.760 --> 36:34.512
Now, I'm reliably informed

36:34.560 --> 36:37.836
that you're the very best we have
in your particular field.

36:37.880 --> 36:40.030
Did he say that?

36:40.080 --> 36:41.513
Did he really? He did?

36:41.560 --> 36:44.028
Did he actually say
you are the best man?

36:44.080 --> 36:44.751
Aye.

36:44.800 --> 36:48.713
The Russians would put them
up against a wall, of that I've no doubt.

36:48.760 --> 36:51.513
The Americans apparently strangle the buggers,

36:51.560 --> 36:55.075
leave them dangling
on the end of a rope for half an hour.

36:55.120 --> 36:59.750
But I understand that you adopt
a more sophisticated method, Mr Pierrepoint.

36:59.800 --> 37:02.030
Well, I must get some starch for your collars.

37:02.080 --> 37:05.277
And I might have saved up
enough coupons for a new pair of shoes.

37:05.320 --> 37:07.993
I've a system of variable drops, sir.

37:08.040 --> 37:11.430
Separation of the second and third
vertebrae results in instant death.

37:11.480 --> 37:13.710
And you can guarantee that,

37:13.760 --> 37:14.875
in every instance?

37:15.240 --> 37:17.549
Yes, sir, I believe I can.

37:18.480 --> 37:21.199
Well, you're the man for me, Mr Pierrepoint.

37:21.240 --> 37:22.514
I want the world to know

37:22.560 --> 37:27.509
that our executions are the most efficient
and the most humane.

37:28.400 --> 37:31.551
And you're a very important part of that plan.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.033
And what did you say?

37:33.080 --> 37:37.517
I told him I was busy with my grocery
deliveries, but if I could find...

37:37.560 --> 37:38.310
Albert!

37:38.840 --> 37:40.910
What do you think I said? I told him...

37:42.840 --> 37:44.990
I fly to Germany on Wednesday.

37:45.040 --> 37:47.190
I might be gone for a week to ten days.

37:49.480 --> 37:51.391
Chose me special.

37:51.440 --> 37:52.111
Aye.

37:52.160 --> 37:53.832
This is it, Annie.

37:56.680 --> 37:58.079
I'm number one.

38:22.600 --> 38:24.750
- Mr Pierrepoint.
- Aye.

38:24.800 --> 38:26.472
If you'd like to follow me, sir.

38:36.160 --> 38:38.116
Here's the list for Thursday.

38:42.480 --> 38:43.595
Ah.

38:43.920 --> 38:46.195
Pierrepoint, good to see you again.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.593
Governor Paton-Walsh.

38:48.280 --> 38:52.398
I'm sorry, sir, I should say Brigadier.
I did wonder when they said the name.

38:52.440 --> 38:55.557
I understand
Monty asked for you personally.

38:55.600 --> 38:57.989
I'm sure I was just the first one on the list, sir.

38:58.040 --> 39:00.235
Yes. Well, look...

39:00.280 --> 39:04.671
We've had the gallows constructed
to Home Office specifications,

39:04.720 --> 39:05.994
as you've requested.

39:06.680 --> 39:11.151
And here's the list
of tomorrow's condemned prisoners.

39:15.840 --> 39:20.152
Don't know what we'd have made
of this back in civvy street, eh, Pierrepoint?

39:20.200 --> 39:22.031
13 in one day?

39:23.080 --> 39:27.312
I'm sorry. I'm not with you, sir.
I thought we had a week to do this job.

39:27.680 --> 39:31.468
Well, yes, but there are
different batches each day.

39:33.240 --> 39:36.232
Well, how many others are there, sir?

39:38.360 --> 39:40.920
47 in total.

39:41.440 --> 39:42.395
47?

39:42.440 --> 39:44.237
And that's just this week.

39:45.000 --> 39:47.753
I'm afraid you'll find them coming thick and fast

39:47.800 --> 39:50.519
now that the courts have delivered their verdicts.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.272
Jolly good.

39:54.720 --> 39:58.395
Lieutenant Llewelyn here has been
assigned to act as your assistant,

39:58.440 --> 40:00.078
and he'll show you to your quarters.

40:01.080 --> 40:04.038
- Shall I take these for you, sir?
- No, I'll hold on to that one.

40:04.080 --> 40:05.069
Thank you, sir.

40:21.680 --> 40:23.477
It is rather a lot, isn't it, sir?

40:26.040 --> 40:27.871
13 in one day.

40:27.920 --> 40:30.115
What Monty has asked for, Monty will get.

40:42.040 --> 40:45.555
The big fellow to the right, that's Kramer.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.999
Commandant of Belsen.

40:48.120 --> 40:51.351
He used to stand on his balcony
and take pot shots at the poor buggers for fun.

40:52.760 --> 40:55.433
A little behind him, older fellow...

40:55.480 --> 40:57.038
that's Fritz Klein.

40:57.080 --> 41:00.356
Doctor Death, we call him.
Did all the experiments.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.630
The young woman to the right,

41:02.680 --> 41:05.069
that's Irma Grese.

41:05.120 --> 41:08.749
Used to walk round the camp with a bullwhip.
Witnesses saw her using...

41:08.800 --> 41:10.995
Now, listen to me, Lieutenant.

41:12.480 --> 41:16.155
We're not interested, understand?
We don't care what they've done.

41:16.200 --> 41:19.909
They're human beings, and they've got to die.
That's all we need to know.

41:19.960 --> 41:22.633
When you're working with me,
you concentrate on height,

41:22.680 --> 41:24.955
weight, and physical condition.

41:25.000 --> 41:28.117
That way we get the job done
quickly and efficiently.

41:28.920 --> 41:29.955
Yes, sir.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.118
196lb.

41:43.080 --> 41:44.069
Irma Grese.

41:55.640 --> 41:56.959
Five three.

41:58.640 --> 42:00.756
You do the Jews' work for them.

42:06.880 --> 42:08.791
113lb.

42:13.320 --> 42:14.912
That's the last of them.

42:18.360 --> 42:21.989
I'm supposed to let them hang
for an hour before we take them down.

42:22.040 --> 42:24.873
Have to cut that back to 20 minutes,
or we'll never get it done.

42:26.360 --> 42:29.477
We'll double up with the men,
but do the women first, one at a time.

42:30.680 --> 42:34.639
- Start with her.
- Yes. Arrogant bitch.

42:35.560 --> 42:36.959
She's the youngest.

42:38.480 --> 42:40.277
She'll be the most frightened.

42:56.760 --> 42:57.749
Irma Grese.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.594
Follow me.

43:44.760 --> 43:48.150
Right, gentlemen,
we'll reassemble in 20 minutes.

44:52.840 --> 44:55.479
Strange. I thought this would be a piece of cake.

44:57.240 --> 44:59.231
After what these people have done.

45:02.360 --> 45:05.750
Lining someone up in your sights,
and pulling the trigger...

45:07.600 --> 45:09.033
...was one thing.

45:10.600 --> 45:12.989
But standing with them on the gallows...

45:14.080 --> 45:16.071
...both knowing what's going to happen...

45:23.240 --> 45:25.800
I think it's the knowing
that's the worst part of it.

45:27.240 --> 45:29.754
The absolute certainty
that they're going to die.

45:32.480 --> 45:34.277
Seeing it in their eyes.

45:43.760 --> 45:45.716
Still, it's like you said.

45:47.080 --> 45:48.877
It's not really us in here, is it?

45:49.800 --> 45:50.789
Aye.

45:52.240 --> 45:53.639
That's right, lad.

46:02.640 --> 46:04.437
Time for a brew?

46:06.760 --> 46:09.479
No, we don't want to fall behind.

47:41.200 --> 47:42.189
Right...

47:44.720 --> 47:47.359
Fetch the last coffin in, that's us done.

47:47.920 --> 47:51.833
There's no more left, sir.
Bit of a breakdown in communication.

47:54.080 --> 47:56.310
- How do you mean?
- There's no more coffins.

47:56.680 --> 47:58.432
They said just to stretcher him out.

47:58.480 --> 48:00.391
Tip him into the ground as he is.

48:02.480 --> 48:04.311
No.

48:04.360 --> 48:06.032
No, no, no, no, that's not right.

48:06.920 --> 48:09.309
There are 13 prisoners.
There should be 13 coffins.

48:10.360 --> 48:12.954
No, I'm... I'm not having it.

48:15.560 --> 48:17.198
13th day of the month...

48:17.240 --> 48:18.673
13 prisoners...

48:18.720 --> 48:20.278
13 witnesses...

48:20.320 --> 48:21.992
I'm not having it at all.

48:22.720 --> 48:26.599
This man has paid the price,
do you understand? He's atoned for his sins.

48:27.880 --> 48:31.156
What's left of him should be
treated with gentle dignity. Do you see?

48:33.000 --> 48:35.753
Yes, sir. I'll... go and sort another coffin.

48:37.200 --> 48:38.633
Aye, you do that, lad.

49:19.480 --> 49:20.879
Mr Pierrepoint?

49:22.360 --> 49:23.349
Mr Pierrepoint.

49:24.040 --> 49:25.553
Jack Ellis, Daily Sketch.

49:25.600 --> 49:29.115
Can you tell us about your time over
in Germany? How many did you drop?

49:29.160 --> 49:30.798
- You what?
- The Belsen mob.

49:30.840 --> 49:32.956
Did they have any last words on the gallows?

49:33.320 --> 49:35.356
Have you got a message for our readers?

49:35.400 --> 49:37.072
No, I bloody haven't. Now hop it.

49:45.200 --> 49:46.872
Is that you, love?

49:46.920 --> 49:50.310
Love, there's a reporter out there,
and a fella taking photographs.

49:50.360 --> 49:52.669
Yes, I know, I know.

49:52.720 --> 49:56.793
They've been there a couple of days,
asking when you'd be back, and...

49:56.840 --> 49:59.752
- And you've been on the wireless.
- How do you mean?

49:59.800 --> 50:03.349
Mentioned you by name.
Albert Pierrepoint, they said.

50:03.400 --> 50:06.312
- What have they been saying?
- Oh, you know, where you've been,

50:06.960 --> 50:08.871
what you've been doing, and...

50:09.720 --> 50:13.076
You've been in the papers too, loads of times.
I've kept them for you.

50:15.800 --> 50:18.109
Well, that isn't right.

50:18.160 --> 50:19.639
No, no, no, no, no...

50:20.960 --> 50:22.632
That isn't right at all, no.

50:23.120 --> 50:25.236
Good luck to you, Mr Pierrepoint.

50:27.120 --> 50:29.031
Keep up the good work, Albert.

50:29.080 --> 50:32.277
String them all up, I say. Nazi swine.

50:35.160 --> 50:37.196
- Hip. Hip.
- Hooray.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.355
# For he's a jolly good fellow

50:41.760 --> 50:43.955
# For he's a jolly good fellow

50:44.240 --> 50:47.596
# For he's a jolly good fellow

50:47.640 --> 50:49.517
# And so say all of us.

50:54.640 --> 50:55.629
Cheers.

50:56.840 --> 50:57.829
So...

50:59.160 --> 51:00.673
how's it going, then?

51:00.720 --> 51:03.029
You know, with your lady friend.

51:04.680 --> 51:07.592
Over. Well, I finished it with her.

51:09.600 --> 51:12.239
Yeah, she was messing me about.

51:13.320 --> 51:15.595
Devastated she was, when I told her.

51:15.960 --> 51:17.632
Said I was everything to her.

51:18.480 --> 51:20.869
I bought her a diamond ring and everything.

51:21.360 --> 51:23.032
Cost me a month's wages, but...

51:23.880 --> 51:26.075
But I broke it off, because...

51:26.120 --> 51:27.758
she was messing me about.

51:29.080 --> 51:32.755
Well, there's only so much
that you can put up with, isn't there?

51:38.280 --> 51:39.872
Look at that.

51:40.440 --> 51:41.919
It's not right, Annie.

51:43.480 --> 51:46.790
What I do is private.
Now everybody knows about it.

51:48.520 --> 51:51.637
I'm not comfortable with it.
It's not how it's done.

51:55.880 --> 51:58.314
No, I've been thinking, love.

51:58.360 --> 52:00.715
I've done my duty.

52:00.760 --> 52:02.432
Maybe it's time to give it up.

52:06.200 --> 52:09.431
I think you're right.
I think you should give it up.

52:09.480 --> 52:13.314
You've always said you don't get
enough respect delivering groceries.

52:13.360 --> 52:16.909
- No, but I meant, you know...
- I know what you meant, love.

52:16.960 --> 52:18.871
But just listen to me for a minute, will you?

52:27.200 --> 52:30.670
This money
that you brought back from Germany...

52:31.520 --> 52:35.718
Well, with what we've got already,
there's nearly £300 here.

52:35.760 --> 52:37.716
You're not to touch that.

52:37.760 --> 52:41.116
Listen, you've always said you wanted
to be your own boss, haven't you?

52:41.680 --> 52:43.477
Well, now is your chance.

52:43.560 --> 52:47.838
The lease on The Struggler is up in two months.
I telephoned the brewery.

52:48.280 --> 52:51.272
We could set ourselves up
nicely there with this.

52:52.160 --> 52:55.436
- We've no experience of running a pub.
- Well...

52:55.480 --> 52:57.550
We could make a go of it, I know we could.

52:57.600 --> 53:00.319
We might fall flat on our faces.
We've no idea how to...

53:00.360 --> 53:02.396
how to drum up custom or anything.

53:02.440 --> 53:05.432
Oh, well,
I think there's a few people out there

53:06.280 --> 53:09.795
who'd like to buy a pint off the man
who hanged the Beast of Belsen.

53:10.520 --> 53:11.509
Don't you?

53:44.440 --> 53:46.032
Hasn't stopped rabbiting, Evans.

53:48.040 --> 53:49.439
Night and day,

53:50.080 --> 53:51.479
on and on...

53:52.440 --> 53:54.510
about how it was some other fella done it.

53:58.240 --> 53:59.912
He can't face it.

54:02.120 --> 54:04.190
Strangled his own daughter.

54:04.240 --> 54:06.993
Yeah, and buried her in the wash house.

54:09.440 --> 54:11.112
And now he can't face it.

54:24.560 --> 54:26.039
Mr Pierrepoint.

54:26.840 --> 54:30.116
Really and truly,
I'm in here for something I never done.

54:30.160 --> 54:32.879
All right. Follow me.

54:40.720 --> 54:43.439
I think it was probably Christie what done it.

54:53.000 --> 54:57.118
...the death sentence.
Abolish capital punishment.

54:57.760 --> 54:58.556
Hear! Hear!

55:01.960 --> 55:04.269
It's Pierrepoint, the murderer.

55:04.320 --> 55:05.719
There. There.

55:07.040 --> 55:08.951
May God forgive you.

56:35.120 --> 56:37.031
Here he is. Here's the guv'nor.

56:38.680 --> 56:40.591
All right, Albert.

56:48.960 --> 56:50.188
What's up with old Tish?

56:51.360 --> 56:53.999
I don't know.
He's been like that all evening.

56:55.920 --> 56:57.990
Two pints, and a whisky and ginger.

56:58.040 --> 56:59.792
Righto.

57:01.920 --> 57:03.319
What are all those?

57:04.160 --> 57:05.559
They're for you.

57:05.600 --> 57:07.795
They've been buying them for you all night.

57:08.160 --> 57:11.277
- I couldn't drink all those. What'll I do with them?
- Sell 'em.

57:11.920 --> 57:14.480
- Whisky and ginger was it, love?
- That's it, thanks.

57:16.080 --> 57:18.594
Hey, Tosh.
Come on, Tosh, give us a song, man.

57:18.640 --> 57:20.676
How about it, Tish lad, eh?

57:20.720 --> 57:22.438
Mind your backs.

57:26.320 --> 57:27.992
I'll give you a song.

57:31.320 --> 57:33.390
# Jealous heart

57:34.520 --> 57:38.069
# O, jealous heart stop beating

57:39.400 --> 57:42.551
# Can't you see

57:42.600 --> 57:46.718
# The damage you have done?

57:48.000 --> 57:52.039
# You have driven her

57:52.120 --> 57:55.635
# Away forever

57:56.600 --> 57:58.636
# O, jealous heart

57:59.600 --> 58:05.197
# Now I'm the lonely one

58:13.640 --> 58:15.551
Come on, lad, let's do 'em a number.

58:15.600 --> 58:18.398
We'll give them a giggle.
What do you fancy doing, eh?

58:18.440 --> 58:19.793
Come on.

58:19.840 --> 58:21.751
Liven up, come on.

58:28.600 --> 58:29.828
Steady, lad.

58:29.880 --> 58:31.518
Gin and tonic.

58:38.120 --> 58:39.314
Jessie?

58:39.360 --> 58:42.193
- Oh, God, here he is.
- This is him, yes?

58:42.720 --> 58:44.233
You're to keep away from her.

58:45.120 --> 58:46.838
She doesn't want you hanging around,

58:46.880 --> 58:50.190
following her, staring at her window, OK?

58:50.240 --> 58:52.071
You keep away from her.

58:52.120 --> 58:54.953
- She's with me now.
- I'm going away with him.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.037
Me and t'kids.
Somewhere you won't be able to follow us.

58:58.080 --> 58:59.433
Keep your hands off her.

58:59.480 --> 59:01.118
I love you, Jessie.

59:01.160 --> 59:03.355
Right, come on, now. That's enough.

59:03.400 --> 59:05.675
- Any more, I'll have to call the police.
- OK.

59:07.240 --> 59:10.949
- He's got the message.
- Right, I'd like the two of you out now, please.

59:11.000 --> 59:13.150
I'm not going anywhere.

59:13.200 --> 59:14.997
It's him that's been bothering me.

59:15.320 --> 59:18.198
- He had it coming.
- Right, come on, now, love, please.

59:18.240 --> 59:22.756
Get your hands off me. I'm not having them
on me after what they've done.

59:22.800 --> 59:25.109
Right. That's it. Out.

59:25.640 --> 59:27.073
I don't know how you stand it.

59:27.160 --> 59:28.559
Him touching you.

59:29.480 --> 59:31.596
They're covered in blood, his hands.

59:32.200 --> 59:33.713
That's what they are.

59:36.080 --> 59:37.399
Filthy with it, both of you.

59:49.480 --> 59:51.516
I even prayed to God the other night.

59:53.600 --> 59:56.637
Just to give me some peace.

59:57.720 --> 59:59.950
To stop me thinking about her.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.879
Best thing all round is to try and forget it.

01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:05.148
Yeah.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.877
Do you know what I admire about you?

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:13.229
It's your strength of character.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.069
The way you keep things under your hat.

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.351
I mean, doing the things you do.

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.199
Bearing that load.

01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:26.874
And nobody would have guessed a thing.

01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.077
It's not been easy.

01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:37.471
I've got things in here too
that I'd rather they weren't there.

01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:42.472
Oh, aye, I can keep them at bay, yeah.

01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:44.192
But they're waiting for me.

01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:49.708
Waiting for me to let my guard down.
Waiting all the bloody time they are.

01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.757
I did a lot of jobs in Germany.

01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:03.077
More than were really good for me.

01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.751
Too many, really.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.439
I get so bloody tired now.

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:14.469
Albert?

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.431
Hm?

01:01:19.960 --> 01:01:20.949
But...

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:25.032
I don't let things bother me.
Oh, no, no.

01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.832
No, I sleep like a baby, don't I, Annie?

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.791
- Mm.
- Aye.

01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:35.632
I'd best be going.

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:36.999
Aye.

01:01:40.920 --> 01:01:43.480
- Goodnight, Annie.
- Night, Tish.

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:45.717
All right.

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:52.952
Night, Tish lad.

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:05.031
Tosh...

01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:06.991
I am so sorry.

01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:40.954
I've packed your bag for the morning.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.878
Oh, yeah, I saw that.
Thanks. Thanks, love, aye.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.715
- So, what did Tish have to say?
- Oh...

01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:52.952
He was...

01:02:55.920 --> 01:02:57.558
...very apologetic.

01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:01.919
So he should be,
bringing all that trouble into the pub.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:07.632
He loves her.

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:11.796
Aye.

01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:15.912
He told me so.

01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.717
There's a record here of a job at Strangeways,

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:26.191
but there's no corresponding payment.

01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.751
What?

01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.360
Oh, aye, yeah,
it was probably a reprieve, you know.

01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:33.677
Happens all the time.

01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:36.996
Is there no cancellation fee?

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.031
It depends on the prison, you know.

01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:42.235
Some prisons pay, and some don't.

01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:43.952
Well, that's not fair.

01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:48.834
It's not your fault they're reprieved, is it?

01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:53.032
What about the inconvenience?
Going all that way down there for nothing.

01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:55.196
Well, it's only the pub, isn't it?

01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:56.719
You cover for me.

01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.194
Yeah, but they don't know that, do they?

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:06.394
You do a grand job running this place,
you know.

01:04:07.360 --> 01:04:09.271
No...

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.832
I'm really proud of you, Annie.

01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:19.230
Albert Pierrepoint. It is you, isn't it?

01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:24.270
- I know you from your photographs.
- I'm sorry, madam, can I help you?

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:25.759
Oh, dear God.

01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:27.994
Please save him.

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.312
Please save my boy.
They say it's you going to hang him.

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.511
- I'm sorry, madam. I can't help you.
- Oh, please, Mr Pierrepoint.

01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.757
Please. He was a good boy, my Jimmy.

01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:37.590
Please.

01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.875
Tell them
you're not gonna go through with it.

01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:43.354
Sorry, madam. You've got the wrong man.

01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:46.233
Please. I can't think how else to save him.

01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.999
Please, Mr Pierrepoint.

01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.270
- I'm sorry, madam.
- Please.

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.433
Please.

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:55.277
Please, Mr Pierrepoint.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:57.231
Please.

01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:38.755
I shall be away on the 27th and the 28th.

01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:40.199
Righto, love.

01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:14.197
I've had to duck round the other side,
you know what I mean?

01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:17.071
- Albert.
- Georgie.

01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.715
- Seen the anti-mob outside?
- Aye.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.512
They keep coming back for more.

01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:25.394
They'll be there tomorrow morning.
Don't matter how cold it gets tonight.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.752
I mean, what do they want, Albert?

01:06:30.840 --> 01:06:32.796
This fella, Corbitt.

01:06:32.840 --> 01:06:34.432
He's took a young woman's life.

01:06:34.480 --> 01:06:37.517
He took her to an hotel room and strangled her.

01:06:37.560 --> 01:06:39.755
She's never coming back, is she, Albert?

01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.030
Why would they put up such a fuss
on his behalf?

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:48.950
Let them cry and holler
as much as they like, Georgie.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:52.549
You do your job, and I do mine.

01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:54.795
And I shall sleep soundly tomorrow,

01:06:57.120 --> 01:06:58.314
just like I always do.

01:06:59.240 --> 01:07:01.151
Ah, there you are, Pierrepoint.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:02.599
Governor.

01:07:02.640 --> 01:07:04.949
This fellow Corbitt tomorrow...

01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.274
Sir?

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.231
One thing rather queer to relate...

01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.874
The fact is, he says he knows you.

01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.159
- Does he?
- Yes.

01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:15.792
Says he's a friend of yours.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:20.109
I don't know any James Corbitt, sir.
I've never heard the name before.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:23.709
Since my picture's been in the newspaper,
lots of people think they know me.

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:28.390
Only he's getting into rather a state over whether
or not you'll acknowledge him tomorrow.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.194
In what way?

01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:34.630
Well, on a personal level,
I suppose, when you enter the cell.

01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:39.395
He says it would mean
a great deal to him if you did.

01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:41.829
Well, that's... that's not really the way, sir.

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:43.791
Help smooth things over, no doubt.

01:07:43.840 --> 01:07:46.673
We don't want any fuss, do we, Pierrepoint?

01:07:46.720 --> 01:07:47.391
No, sir.

01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:49.351
Very good.

01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:59.430
# Can't you see the damage you...

01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:02.278
Don't get many feel like singing,
do we, Albert?

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.834
- # You have driven...
- Still, he's not got a bad voice as it goes.

01:08:06.880 --> 01:08:08.108
Has he?

01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:11.469
# O, jealous heart

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:15.308
# Now I'm the lonely one

01:08:37.359 --> 01:08:38.997
Albert, what's up?

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.111
6ft um...

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:49.591
6ft... 6ft 6 or something.

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.149
What's this?

01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.591
We're to be brought a hot meal.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.950
That's our entitlement. A hot meal.
We're not bloody rabbits.

01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:18.270
- Well, the cook has gone home.
- Get them to fetch the bugger back.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.594
I'll tell you what -
there'll be no bloody job tomorrow.

01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:28.113
Go and see what you can do.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.753
Hello, Tosh.

01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.390
Hello, Tish, old pal.

01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:12.871
I'm sorry, lad.

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:14.911
You're going to have to turn around.

01:11:39.440 --> 01:11:41.271
Come with me now, lad.

01:11:41.320 --> 01:11:43.959
You'll be all right, Tish.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:45.399
Come on, now.

01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:50.191
I'll look after you. Come on, lad.

01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:07.589
No, no...

01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:17.119
Thank you, Albert.

01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:00.275
Where have you been?

01:14:00.320 --> 01:14:01.958
You know where I've been.

01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:05.954
I was getting worried.

01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:07.911
You're so much later than usual.

01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:10.514
Hm?

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:12.471
Well, I went for a drink.

01:14:14.160 --> 01:14:15.149
Right.

01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:18.237
Did you meet up with some pals?

01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.311
I haven't got any pals.

01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:26.631
I just wanted to spend that.

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.630
Well, your dinner will be a bit dried up now,
but I'll put some gravy on it.

01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.557
Would you like a potato with...

01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:40.989
I don't... I don't want anything, thank you.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:45.872
Why don't you ask me...

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:49.191
...why I went drinking?

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.276
Like my father used to. Hm?

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.071
Maybe you'll have a sandwich later.

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:03.434
Not a bad night tonight.

01:15:03.480 --> 01:15:05.072
Most of the regulars in.

01:15:06.320 --> 01:15:09.630
I put some... some boxes of chocolates
behind the bar.

01:15:09.680 --> 01:15:11.591
Sold 11 of them.

01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.828
I think, come closing time they feel a bit guilty.

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:17.713
They think maybe
they'd better take home a peace offering.

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:22.112
I thought maybe we should start...

01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:25.072
Do you want to know what I did today, Annie?

01:15:25.120 --> 01:15:25.791
Eh?

01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:34.598
I hanged Tish.

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:38.069
Aye.

01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:41.076
Tish?

01:15:42.760 --> 01:15:46.355
James Henry Corbitt, that was his name.
You know, we never knew that.

01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.879
- He murdered Jessie, you know.
- Tish?

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:54.399
One night, he followed her to Liverpool,

01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.159
cheap hotel, his hands around her throat.

01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.236
If he can't have her, nobody can.

01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:04.511
Another sad, sordid little story,
just like the rest of them.

01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.839
And I just put a rope round his neck,

01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:11.992
and hanged him for it.

01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:17.072
Well, say something.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:20.551
- Don't you want to know about it?
- No.

01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:22.591
Don't you want to know what he looked like?

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.235
- What he said?
- No.

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:30.319
Don't you want to know what it felt like
to take a friend and do that to him? Eh?

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:39.159
No, what I was going to say was...

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:41.031
I thought we could start doing flowers.

01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:43.196
Keep bunches of flowers behind the bar...

01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:44.912
What do you think?

01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:47.957
I've done for him, Annie.

01:16:48.680 --> 01:16:50.796
Don't you understand?

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:54.037
I've killed him, and for what? Hm?

01:16:55.320 --> 01:16:58.039
For money. Dirty bloody money.

01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:02.675
- I looked into his eyes, Annie.
- Stop it, please.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.870
- He saw me. He thanked me.
- Stop it.

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:08.879
We don't talk about it, Albert.

01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:12.591
That's what we've always agreed.

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.359
Well, I want to talk about it now.

01:17:18.120 --> 01:17:19.519
Look here...

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:22.749
Of course it was me.

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:26.513
It's been me all along. I've done for them.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.549
Me.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:33.470
At least they killed in jealousy, haste, or passion.

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.715
What about me? What can I say?

01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:39.394
I've murdered the bloody lot of them. Look.

01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:41.154
Hundreds of them.

01:17:41.240 --> 01:17:42.912
Hundreds and hundreds of them.

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.155
Get off me, get off me.

01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:47.714
No, Annie, I can't bear it any more.

01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:50.549
- Not on my own.
- You are going to have to.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:52.750
I don't want to know about it, Albert, I don't.

01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:54.870
Hold me, Annie, please.

01:17:54.920 --> 01:17:57.070
Like you always do.

01:17:57.120 --> 01:17:58.792
Tell me I'm not a bad man.

01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:02.239
I can't.

01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:03.633
I can't, Albert. I can't.

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:04.789
Can't.

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:06.593
Can't.

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.429
No.

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.675
What do you think it's been like for me
all these years? Ever think about that?

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.119
Staring,

01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.628
whispers.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:39.236
You think you're the only one who's suffered.

01:18:42.400 --> 01:18:44.311
We don't talk about what you do, Albert.

01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.552
No...

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:48.397
We don't. Never have, never will.

01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:52.109
No.

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:55.789
No.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:58.599
Sorry, love.

01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.589
Sorry.

01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:17.919
Today the murder of Ruth Ellis

01:22:17.960 --> 01:22:21.157
committed in our name.

01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:01.638
<i>Behind another line of policemen
a car is emerging.</i>

01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:03.591
<i>Its passenger...</i>

01:23:04.440 --> 01:23:05.839
<i>It's Mr Pierrepoint.</i>

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:10.354
<i>It's Albert Pierrepoint
who is now the target of the crowd's fury.</i>

01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:38.076
I notice they've not paid you for that job in July.

01:23:38.120 --> 01:23:39.235
Strangeways job.

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:44.037
I think it must have been
another of them reprieves.

01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.511
It's not right, Albert.

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:53.640
I don't think you should put up with it any more.

01:23:55.720 --> 01:23:57.517
I think you should write to them.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:02.799
Write to them, Anne?

01:24:04.680 --> 01:24:06.272
What would I say?

01:24:07.480 --> 01:24:09.789
Oh, I don't know, but...

01:24:09.840 --> 01:24:12.229
I know they're exploiting your good will.

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.438
After all the years of loyal service
you've given them.

01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:22.518
If I were you,
I'd have a good mind to...

01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.038
To what, Anne?

01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:27.272
Well, I don't know, but...

01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:32.031
Tell them you're considering
taking your name off the list.

01:24:34.680 --> 01:24:36.671
In protest, you know.

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:41.909
Yes.

01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:45.874
Aye, yes, it has been bothering me.

01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:50.193
I have to make myself available
on the day, don't I?

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:55.074
I might have to get extra staff in to cover.
They don't know otherwise, do they?

01:24:57.440 --> 01:24:59.431
Well, it's up to you, of course, but...

01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:02.670

01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:05.072
I certainly wouldn't.

01:25:06.040 --> 01:25:07.917
No.

01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:10.349

01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:15.993

01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:21.312
I shall write a letter tonight.

01:25:23.480 --> 01:25:24.469
Aye.

01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:51.117
I'll make us some tea.
