WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:02.995
(driving rock intro begins)

00:10.810 --> 00:12.607
* It's harder than they say

00:12.640 --> 00:14.301
* To try and settle down

00:14.340 --> 00:15.705
* You see it in her line

00:15.740 --> 00:17.048
* You look it up and down

00:17.080 --> 00:19.071
* Somehow you're always there

00:19.120 --> 00:20.371
* Somehow it's always wrong

00:20.420 --> 00:22.308
* As far as I can see

00:22.350 --> 00:24.079
* That much'll never change

00:24.120 --> 00:26.315
* It's what you always know,
just like your name *

00:26.360 --> 00:28.157
* And when it rains,
when it rains *

00:28.190 --> 00:29.452
* Oh, the sun comes out again

00:29.490 --> 00:31.082
* Crown of age, crown of age

00:31.130 --> 00:32.654
* Just like it's always been

00:32.700 --> 00:34.691
* Crown of age, crown of age

00:34.730 --> 00:36.391
* Yes, it's all up to you

00:36.430 --> 00:38.591
(rock beat continues)

00:44.570 --> 00:46.276
(bell clings)

00:46.310 --> 00:47.538
(printer whirrs)

00:54.550 --> 00:55.448
(computer beeps,
rock beat continues)

01:05.360 --> 01:07.248
* When it rains, when it rains

01:07.300 --> 01:08.790
* Oh, the sun comes out again

01:08.830 --> 01:10.661
* Crown of age, crown of age

01:10.700 --> 01:12.292
* Just like it's always been

01:12.340 --> 01:13.489
* And you know, and you know

01:13.540 --> 01:15.758
* Oh, what you've gotta do

01:15.800 --> 01:17.461
* Crown of age, crown of age

01:17.510 --> 01:18.431
* Yes, it's all up to you

01:18.470 --> 01:20.609
* Crown of age, crown of age

01:20.640 --> 01:22.540
* Yes, it's all up to you...

01:24.650 --> 01:26.845
(man screams, groans in pain)

01:28.550 --> 01:30.609
INTERVIEWER: I don't understand.
You're sumg

01:30.650 --> 01:32.515
the gun manufacturer?

01:32.560 --> 01:34.448
No, we're suing the designer
of the 3-D gun

01:34.490 --> 01:36.629
that_malfunctioned
and crippled our client.

01:36.660 --> 01:39.493
So why would that make you
a better state's attorney?

01:39.530 --> 01:41.657
Actions speak louder than words.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.691
I've been actively pursuing

01:43.730 --> 01:47.496
cases like this on gun control
for... years.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.508
You've also defended some pretty
bad people, too-- for example,

01:49.540 --> 01:53.169
Lemond Bishop.
He's no longer a client.

01:53.210 --> 01:56.475
INTERVIEWER: To your knowledge,
has Lemond Bishop contributed

01:56.510 --> 01:59.217
to your campaign
or your PAC?

01:59.250 --> 02:00.239
No.

02:00.280 --> 02:02.145
MAN:
She's lying.

02:02.190 --> 02:04.545
How do you know?
Because she used
to represent Bishop.

02:04.590 --> 02:06.911
And you're giving her a
free ride this saint crap.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.485
Uh, M-Martin, I benefit just
as much as she does from...

02:09.530 --> 02:11.259
Frank, she got
the endorsement.

02:11.290 --> 02:13.155
She lied, and she got the
newspaper's endorsement.

02:13.200 --> 02:15.555
That's a three-point bump
three days before the election.

02:15.600 --> 02:18.626
So set up more events.
I'm here; I'm ready.

02:18.670 --> 02:20.535
Is this another
"Come to Jesus" moment?

02:20.570 --> 02:22.606
'Cause I don't know
how many more of these

02:22.640 --> 02:23.732
I can take, Martin.

02:23.770 --> 02:25.806
Look, I like you, Frank.

02:25.840 --> 02:28.274
You're a good man,
possibly even a great one,

02:28.310 --> 02:30.778
and I will do everything
I can to help you win...

02:30.810 --> 02:32.471
but you are too nice.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.408
She's a liar.
She told them...

02:34.450 --> 02:35.769
Exactly what they
wanted to hear,

02:35.820 --> 02:38.311
and I'll bet you
every dollar I have

02:38.350 --> 02:40.489
they knew she was lying,
they wanted her to lie--

02:40.520 --> 02:42.624
because people respect
someone who's willing

02:42.660 --> 02:45.322
to lie for what
they believe in.

02:45.360 --> 02:47.328
It shows strength.

02:47.360 --> 02:48.952
They don't respect
the truth.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.820
Every time you said something
self-deprecatingly true

02:50.870 --> 02:53.896
to that editorial board, they
all patted you on the back

02:53.940 --> 02:55.339
and then snickered
behind their hands.

02:55.370 --> 02:56.564
I won't smear her.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.601
That's always what
this comes down to.

02:58.640 --> 03:00.198
I won't go against
my principles.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.605
You disagree with her?

03:01.640 --> 03:02.800
Yes, on policy.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.249
You disagree with her husband?

03:04.280 --> 03:06.248
Yes.
There.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.269
Don't go after her;
go after him.

03:07.320 --> 03:08.548
I'm not running
against her husband.

03:08.580 --> 03:10.639
Exactly, so there's no problem
going after him.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.351
He was corrupt.

03:12.390 --> 03:13.652
What will going
after her husband do?

03:13.690 --> 03:15.419
It will show _what
you're against.

03:15.460 --> 03:16.688
Campaigns aren't just
about what you're for.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.721
They're about
what you're against.

03:18.760 --> 03:19.897
So go after the husband.

03:19.930 --> 03:22.569
JOSH:
For the, uh, uh...

03:22.600 --> 03:24.568
I'm not leaving you in a lurch;
will you stop saying that?
Blah, blah, or whatever.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.862
Please?
Oh, so the whole...
What's going on?

03:25.900 --> 03:27.436
Nothing.
We're...

03:27.470 --> 03:28.767
We've got a problem.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.701
MELISSA:
We can see that.
Tell her the problem, Jon.

03:31.740 --> 03:33.731
Okay.

03:33.780 --> 03:35.577
Uh, the first thing I'll do
is clean house

03:35.610 --> 03:36.872
and take a look at hiring

03:36.910 --> 03:39.242
going back to
Peter Florrick's administra--

03:39.280 --> 03:41.578
So our tracker just picked
this up outside the hotel.

03:41.620 --> 03:42.382
What's wrong with it?

03:42.420 --> 03:44.888
Peter Florrick
brought a new level

03:44.920 --> 03:46.717
of cronyism to the office,

03:46.760 --> 03:48.250
and that's what
I'll need to root out.

03:48.290 --> 03:49.780
Uh, the office needs
an upheaval,

03:49.830 --> 03:51.582
not the partial measures
of Mr. Florrick.

03:51.630 --> 03:53.894
Okay, so he mentions Peter
eight times

03:53.930 --> 03:55.750
in the space of whatever,
a short time.

03:55.800 --> 03:56.926
JOHNNY:
He's coming after you

03:56.970 --> 03:58.494
through your husband.
That's his way

03:58.530 --> 03:59.861
of getting around
your, you know,

03:59.900 --> 04:01.561
little thing.
Your agreement

04:01.600 --> 04:02.669
to not go negative.

04:02.710 --> 04:03.665
So, what do I do, defend Peter?

04:03.710 --> 04:04.699
No, that's exactly
what they want.

04:04.740 --> 04:06.298
I think the time has come

04:06.340 --> 04:07.602
for you to separate yourself.

04:07.640 --> 04:09.540
_ You need
your Sister soulja moment.

04:09.580 --> 04:11.673
So I should criticize Peter?

04:11.710 --> 04:13.746
Yes, his issues.
What issues?

04:13.780 --> 04:15.316
Doesn't matter;
pick one.
God, this is like high school.

04:15.350 --> 04:16.647
The key is to create
a little space

04:16.690 --> 04:17.816
between you and Peter.
That way,

04:17.850 --> 04:18.942
Prady can say whatever he wants,

04:18.990 --> 04:19.979
and none of it
Will land on you.

04:20.020 --> 04:21.317
And what's the con?

04:21.360 --> 04:22.384
The con?

04:22.430 --> 04:23.988
Why wouldn't I do this?

04:24.030 --> 04:25.429
The two of you
were arguing before.

04:25.460 --> 04:27.291
Who's against it?
No.

04:27.330 --> 04:29.366
No, that's not what
we were arguing about.

04:29.400 --> 04:30.469
Tell her,

04:30.500 --> 04:31.660
big man.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.491
(anxious laugh)
Uh...

04:35.540 --> 04:37.030
I've been asked to join
a campaign

04:37.070 --> 04:38.628
in Sacramento on the 7th.

04:38.670 --> 04:39.978
The 7th of...?
This month,

04:40.010 --> 04:41.409
Election Day,
but don't worry.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.600
You are in great shape.

04:42.650 --> 04:43.901
There's not really anything
to be done

04:43.950 --> 04:45.042
on the campaign
at that point.

04:45.080 --> 04:46.616
And this being Chicago,
you know,

04:46.650 --> 04:48.049
there's never any
fraud at the polls.

04:48.080 --> 04:49.411
(phone rings)
Come on, Josh. That's not fair.

04:49.450 --> 04:50.587
We've got lawyers for exactly

04:50.620 --> 04:52.588
that kind of thing.
Alicia...

04:52.620 --> 04:54.781
How's he doing on the stand?
What?

04:54.820 --> 04:57.653
McVeigh, how's he doing
on the stand?

04:57.690 --> 04:59.396
Oh, I don't know;
I haven't checked in.

04:59.430 --> 05:00.499
That's not why I'm calling.

05:00.530 --> 05:01.758
Louis Canning called you.

05:01.800 --> 05:04.360
What? Why?
Uh, he wants to see you.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.867
He's in ICU, but we think
it's a good idea.

05:05.900 --> 05:07.367
We? What do you mean?

05:07.400 --> 05:08.697
We think it's a good idea

05:08.740 --> 05:10.708
for you to go and see him
and get him to sign off

05:10.740 --> 05:11.764
on his lawsuit against us.

05:11.810 --> 05:13.505
While he's in the ICU?

05:13.540 --> 05:15.701
Yes.
You want me to pull an Ashcroft.

05:15.740 --> 05:18.072
Get him to sign something
when he's weak in the hospital?

05:18.110 --> 05:19.748
No, but you're going
to the hospital anyway,

05:19.780 --> 05:21.611
so it would be good for the firm

05:21.650 --> 05:23.083
if he accepted
our reasonable offer.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.519
Look, just call me
when you find out

05:24.550 --> 05:27.348
how McVeigh's doing
on the stand, okay?

05:27.390 --> 05:30.120
McVEIGH: The firearm was devised
through additive manufacturing,

05:30.160 --> 05:34.449
or as it's more popularly known,
3-D printing.

05:34.500 --> 05:35.421
And it works from software?

05:35.460 --> 05:36.597
Yes, open source file.

05:36.630 --> 05:38.461
So if I type in the words,

05:38.500 --> 05:40.639
uh, "3-D printer gun"

05:40.670 --> 05:43.434
right now, it would come up
with a file just like that?

05:43.470 --> 05:45.461
Yes, uh, Mr. Fife's design

05:45.510 --> 05:47.432
is still currently
on his Web site.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.879
POLMAR: So, once you've
downloaded all the schematics

05:48.910 --> 05:50.548
for the gun,

05:50.580 --> 05:52.411
how difficult is it
to print one?

05:52.450 --> 05:55.146
Load a spool of plastic
into a 3-D printer,

05:55.180 --> 05:57.080
push "print."
That's it?

05:57.120 --> 05:59.452
Yes, that's it.
Well, dear God,
that's appalling.

05:59.490 --> 06:00.752
I mean, how long
does it take to print?

06:00.790 --> 06:02.109
McVEIGH:
A gun, Your Honor?

06:02.160 --> 06:03.957
Approximately four hours.

06:03.990 --> 06:06.151
POLMAR:
So, on January the 17...

06:06.190 --> 06:08.727
And this gun, it fires
actual bullets?

06:08.760 --> 06:10.159
Yes, Your Honor.
And it's plastic,

06:10.200 --> 06:12.395
so you could get it through
a, uh, metal detector.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.862
Yes, Your Honor.
Whoof!

06:13.900 --> 06:15.993
Well, thank God for
the Second Amendment.

06:17.170 --> 06:20.003
Well, Your Honor,
this technology

06:20.040 --> 06:22.008
has more to do
with the First Amendment

06:22.040 --> 06:24.076
than the Second.
No, no.
Not if the software can kill.

06:24.110 --> 06:25.702
Yes, but it's not the
sobeare that's killing.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.968
Your Honor, if we could show
you what happened next?

06:28.020 --> 06:30.011
Yeah, yeah, of course.
My apologies.

06:30.050 --> 06:33.679
Um, and I promise
I won't let my bias

06:33.720 --> 06:35.017
impact my decision.
Thank you, Your Honor.

06:35.060 --> 06:37.153
You've always been very fair,

06:37.190 --> 06:38.748
so we're counting on that.
So,

06:38.790 --> 06:41.190
Mr. McVeigh, this is
the gun that was taken

06:41.230 --> 06:42.197
to the Cantata Vega
Shooting Range?

06:42.230 --> 06:43.663
Is that correct?
Yes.

06:43.700 --> 06:46.021
And what happened
at that range?

06:46.070 --> 06:47.731
The gun misfired

06:47.770 --> 06:50.762
and sent shrapnel
through an alley partition

06:50.810 --> 06:52.209
and injured the spine
of Mr. Summerfeldt.

06:52.240 --> 06:53.502
So the misfire

06:53.540 --> 06:55.576
that paralyzed my client
was foreseeable?

06:55.610 --> 06:56.747
Yes, by someone

06:56.780 --> 06:58.668
with experience in printing

06:58.710 --> 07:01.213
and testing 3-D printed guns.

07:01.250 --> 07:03.218
And the shooter, Carsten Pope,
did he have that experience?

07:03.250 --> 07:04.740
McVEIGH:
No, he had never printed

07:04.790 --> 07:06.655
nor fired a gun
like that before.

07:06.690 --> 07:07.816
So who should've known?

07:07.860 --> 07:09.521
The gun designer, Mr. Fife.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.687
He is the expert here;
he made the gun

07:11.730 --> 07:14.927
readily available to the public.
The responsibility is his.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.793
Thank you, Mr. McVeigh.
Nothing further, Your Honor.

07:17.830 --> 07:19.798
He's a good witness.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.502
Mr. McVeigh, how are you?
I'm good, thank you.

07:22.540 --> 07:24.462
Good. Thank you very much

07:24.510 --> 07:26.637
for taking us all
through this technology.

07:26.680 --> 07:28.705
It just seems to get
more and more complicated,

07:28.740 --> 07:30.674
doesn't it?
Oh, yeah, it does.

07:30.710 --> 07:33.975
And culpability, then,
gets more and more complicated,

07:34.020 --> 07:35.817
because it goes through
so many different hands.

07:35.850 --> 07:37.579
Objection, Your Honor.

07:37.620 --> 07:39.588
Ms. Crozier seems to be confused

07:39.620 --> 07:40.780
as to who is on
the witness stand.

07:40.820 --> 07:42.526
No. (chuckles)

07:42.560 --> 07:44.528
I'm just plain confused.

07:44.560 --> 07:46.050
It's not like there's
one manufacturer and one...

07:46.090 --> 07:48.149
Your Honor?
Yeah, um...

07:48.200 --> 07:49.827
Sustained. Is anybody else

07:49.870 --> 07:53.135
really disturbed by all this?

07:53.170 --> 07:54.967
(all talking at once)

07:55.000 --> 07:55.989
Okay, okay, thank you.

07:56.040 --> 07:57.268
That was rhetorical.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.631
Um, no more
editorial content from me.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.705
Ms. Crozier?
Thank you, Your Honor.

08:01.740 --> 08:04.277
So, Mr. McVeigh,

08:04.310 --> 08:05.971
The shooter, Mr. Pope,

08:06.010 --> 08:07.944
sitting right there,
you're not suing him,

08:07.980 --> 08:10.915
Right?
Actually, I'm not suing anyone,
Ms. Crozier.

08:10.950 --> 08:13.510
You're just an expert witness

08:13.560 --> 08:15.255
who happens to be married

08:15.290 --> 08:17.656
_to_one of
the plaintiff's attorneys.

08:17.690 --> 08:19.055
Sorry, let me rephrase that.

08:19.090 --> 08:20.955
The shooter, Mr. Pope,

08:21.000 --> 08:22.968
the one that your wife
is not suing,

08:23.000 --> 08:24.092
he built the gun

08:24.130 --> 08:25.620
that injured
Eddie Summerfeldt.

08:25.670 --> 08:26.989
No.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.632
No.No?

08:28.670 --> 08:29.807
He didn't?
He didn't build it.

08:29.840 --> 08:31.137
He printed it.
But you said that

08:31.170 --> 08:33.309
he didn't have any training
in 3-D printing.

08:33.340 --> 08:35.001
That's correct.
Do you know where he made...

08:35.040 --> 08:37.577
or printed, the gun?

08:37.610 --> 08:38.747
In his garage.

08:38.780 --> 08:40.077
And he spent $25?

08:40.120 --> 08:41.144
God help us.
$22.50

08:41.180 --> 08:43.284
in materials,

08:43.320 --> 08:45.618
and $1,795

08:45.650 --> 08:46.287
for the printer.

08:46.320 --> 08:47.582
Well, I mean,

08:47.620 --> 08:49.622
I don't know much about guns.

08:49.660 --> 08:50.820
You're the expert there,

08:50.860 --> 08:52.623
but I'm still just trying

08:52.660 --> 08:54.150
to figure out why it is

08:54.200 --> 08:55.827
you're suing my client,

08:55.860 --> 08:58.988
who's merely responsible
for the design of the thing,

08:59.030 --> 09:01.931
and not the shooter,
who actually printed

09:01.970 --> 09:03.335
and fired the gun.

09:03.370 --> 09:05.930
Again, ma'am,
I'm not suing anyone.

09:05.970 --> 09:07.870
Well, maybe you could
just convince your wife...

09:07.910 --> 09:09.002
Objection, Your Honor.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.348
I'll sustain that.

09:10.380 --> 09:12.075
I just, H,
I just can't believe it.

09:12.110 --> 09:14.908
Twenty-five dollars.

09:31.330 --> 09:34.731
How is it that you make
me feel like I'm 22?

09:42.280 --> 09:45.340
* Whoo!

09:51.690 --> 09:53.317
How are you, Mr. Canning?

09:53.360 --> 09:54.952
I'm alive.

09:54.990 --> 09:56.252
But you got a new kidney.

09:56.290 --> 09:57.621
Yes.

09:57.660 --> 09:59.651
Sit, sit there.

10:02.700 --> 10:04.224
So, were you elected?

10:04.270 --> 10:05.396
(chuckles) No.

10:05.430 --> 10:07.990
Oh, you lost.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.962
No, it's just three days away.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.069
Oh.

10:12.110 --> 10:13.236
I voted absentee.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.406
Thank you.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.101
No, against you.

10:16.140 --> 10:17.368
(chuckles)

10:24.020 --> 10:25.681
So, Mr. Canning,
if you don't mind...

10:25.720 --> 10:27.381
This girl,
this 13-year-old girl,

10:27.420 --> 10:31.322
went to head a soccer ball
at her junior league game,

10:31.360 --> 10:33.920
and, uh, her head

10:33.960 --> 10:36.690
hit another girl's head,

10:36.730 --> 10:38.425
and she died.

10:38.470 --> 10:40.859
She just...

10:40.900 --> 10:43.437
dropped to the field, dead.

10:43.470 --> 10:45.665
And I don't even know her name.

10:48.140 --> 10:50.005
But she gave me a kidney.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.405
Can you believe that?

10:52.450 --> 10:54.270
I can.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.711
So, I swore to myself
before I went into surgery

10:58.750 --> 11:01.184
that I'd do something for her.

11:01.220 --> 11:05.782
If it worked out,
if-if it went well,

11:05.830 --> 11:07.923
and I lived
that I would do something good.

11:07.960 --> 11:11.066
For her family?
Yes.

11:11.100 --> 11:13.239
I want to liquidate my stocks.

11:13.270 --> 11:15.090
$18 million.

11:15.140 --> 11:17.802
Give them to her family.

11:17.840 --> 11:19.774
Will you do that for me?

11:21.980 --> 11:23.800
Have you called
your estate lavwer?

11:23.850 --> 11:25.477
Yes, he's not
returning my calls.

11:25.510 --> 11:28.047
Think he wants to wait
till I'm dead, and then...

11:28.080 --> 11:30.082
keep all the money in-house.

11:34.020 --> 11:36.318
Who is your estate attorney?

11:36.360 --> 11:39.227
David Lee.

11:39.260 --> 11:42.821
(groans quietly)

11:58.810 --> 12:00.141
FIFE:
I didn't put the file up
to hurt people.

12:00.180 --> 12:02.011
I put it up to protect them.

12:02.050 --> 12:05.781
That you'll have to explain,
Mr. Fife. You wanted to

12:05.820 --> 12:08.857
protect my client
by providing schematics for guns

12:08.890 --> 12:10.255
that are undetectable,

12:10.290 --> 12:11.928
untraceable and unregulated?

12:11.960 --> 12:13.496
Yeah, and uncensorable.

12:13.530 --> 12:15.418
So, this is all about the
First Amendment to you?

12:15.460 --> 12:17.121
Yes. Yes, Your Honor.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.762
I-I have
the First Amendment right

12:18.800 --> 12:20.233
to put out whatever
information I want,

12:20.270 --> 12:21.760
no matter how many laws
are passed

12:21.800 --> 12:23.939
to limit my rights
under the Second.

12:23.970 --> 12:25.801
Did you consider
posting a warning?
ABERNATHY: And you don't worry

12:25.840 --> 12:27.899
about what crazy person
might use your design?

12:27.940 --> 12:30.272
Sure, I do, but I worry more

12:30.310 --> 12:32.972
about what crazy person
will become the next dictator.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.079
And-and what do
dictators confiscate

12:35.120 --> 12:36.542
even before the printing
presses? The guns.

12:36.580 --> 12:38.980
All right, let's move on to...
Um, Your Honor,

12:39.020 --> 12:42.979
may Mr. Fife
finish the answer?
Yes, he may.

12:43.030 --> 12:44.986
3-D technology has made it
impossible

12:45.030 --> 12:47.294
for dictators
to control firearms.

12:47.330 --> 12:50.458
I can e-mail a gun to any person
in the world in seconds.

12:50.500 --> 12:52.388
A rebel fighter in Syria,

12:52.430 --> 12:54.159
a dissident in China,

12:54.200 --> 12:56.236
a freedom fighter
in Pakistan.

12:56.270 --> 13:00.934
This machine has made
democracy possible worldwide.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.504
It is the modern version

13:02.540 --> 13:04.178
of the printing press.

13:05.950 --> 13:07.269
Look, I was watching him,
okay, Diane.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.174
He's still on our side.
I don't know.

13:09.220 --> 13:11.882
Judge Abernathy ends up feeling
so guilty about his bias,

13:11.920 --> 13:14.150
he sometimes
rules against it.

13:14.190 --> 13:17.057
Well, that's harder to do
when the defendant is crazy.

13:17.090 --> 13:19.558
We didn't make
him crazy enough?

13:19.590 --> 13:21.148
Yeah. Let me.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.225
ALICIA:
You're not returning

13:23.270 --> 13:25.898
Canning's calls.
Actually, I am.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.397
David, I just came from him.

13:27.440 --> 13:30.261
He gave me power of attorney
to liquidate all his stocks

13:30.310 --> 13:33.029
and give all $18 million
to the family of the donor.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.502
Okay.
David...

13:34.540 --> 13:36.940
he wants it done now.

13:39.150 --> 13:40.549
Do you know
the donor's family?

13:40.580 --> 13:42.548
No, but I'm sure you can
get it from the hospital.

13:42.580 --> 13:44.138
I did get it from
the hospital.

13:44.190 --> 13:46.215
The Farsouns--
Izzat and Helga.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.013
Their daughter's name
was Leila.

13:48.060 --> 13:50.051
Okay.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.081
Did you contact them?

13:52.130 --> 13:53.597
I did.

13:55.960 --> 13:58.224
David, if you're waiting
for Mr. Canning to die,

13:58.270 --> 14:00.090
I will bring you up
on charges...

14:00.140 --> 14:02.131
They don't want the
money for themselves.

14:02.170 --> 14:04.559
They want to send
it to a charity.

14:04.610 --> 14:08.102
"The Strong Arm of Liberty."

14:08.140 --> 14:10.142
Strong Arm of Liberty support

14:10.180 --> 14:12.307
the oppressed peoples
of Palestine.

14:14.220 --> 14:17.041
You can't let your political
bias impact your representation.

14:17.090 --> 14:18.182
It's Canning's choice.

14:18.220 --> 14:19.949
And I'll facilitate his choice

14:19.990 --> 14:21.480
after I get full
indemnification,

14:21.520 --> 14:23.283
including a letter
from the State Department

14:23.330 --> 14:25.059
saying this group is kosher.

14:25.090 --> 14:27.024
Appropriate.

14:27.060 --> 14:28.948
It's not illegal to give
to pro-Palestinian causes.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.525
It is if they support Hamas.
Do they support Hamas?

14:31.570 --> 14:32.992
It's too new
for the State Department

14:33.040 --> 14:34.189
to make a determination.

14:34.240 --> 14:36.037
And I'm not
spending ten years

14:36.070 --> 14:38.209
in a federal prison for
aiding and abetting terrorists.

14:38.240 --> 14:39.332
(sighing):
Okay.

14:39.370 --> 14:40.598
Let me talk to Canning,

14:40.640 --> 14:42.676
see if he wants
to do other good works.
Yes.

14:42.710 --> 14:44.200
Maybe he can find other ways

14:44.250 --> 14:46.206
of facilitating
the killing of Jews.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.677
POLMAR:
Hello again, Mr. Fife.

14:49.720 --> 14:51.244
Hello back at you.

14:51.290 --> 14:53.087
Now, you made your firearm
sobeare open source

14:53.120 --> 14:54.917
for a very good reason,
isn't that right, Mr. Fife?

14:54.960 --> 14:58.259
You wanted to make it available
to... well, everyone.

14:58.290 --> 15:00.224
Yeah, everyone
with a 3-D printer.

15:00.260 --> 15:02.251
Even felons?
Yes, if they could...

15:02.300 --> 15:04.222
Objection, Your Honor.
Relevance.

15:04.270 --> 15:05.419
The defense opened the door.

15:05.470 --> 15:07.062
They argued
their Constitutional rights

15:07.100 --> 15:09.295
shielded them from culpability.

15:09.340 --> 15:11.467
We merely want to
explore that right.
Yes, seems fair to me.

15:11.510 --> 15:14.172
Overruled.
POLMAR:
You were saying, Mr. Fife?

15:14.210 --> 15:17.304
Oh, I just saw Ms. Crozier
making a signal

15:17.350 --> 15:18.977
to you, Mr. Fife.
Would you care to explain?

15:19.010 --> 15:20.318
Oh, no, I didn't.

15:20.350 --> 15:21.544
Well, I saw you making
what I would interpret

15:21.580 --> 15:23.286
to be a "go-easy" gesture.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.117
CROZIER:
No, Your Honor, I simp...

15:25.150 --> 15:27.254
I was feeling heat coming
from somewhere under...

15:27.290 --> 15:29.019
I don't know if
there's a vent.
Okay, okay.

15:29.060 --> 15:31.255
Okay, then, let's-let's
all stop gesturing.

15:31.290 --> 15:34.327
Mr. Fife seems perfectly capable
of taking care of himself.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.622
Mr. Fife.
Yeah, yes.

15:35.660 --> 15:37.389
If a felon could
afford a 3-D printer,

15:37.430 --> 15:39.398
uh, he would have
access to my software.

15:39.430 --> 15:41.159
And children?

15:41.200 --> 15:43.134
Would you make it
available to children?

15:43.170 --> 15:45.263
It is available
to children,

15:45.310 --> 15:48.177
as is porn, and-and
Kim Kardashian's ass,

15:48.210 --> 15:50.098
unless parents put parental
control on their computers.

15:50.150 --> 15:51.606
In fact,
weren't you quoted as saying,

15:51.650 --> 15:54.278
"I can't wait
for the first school shooting

15:54.320 --> 15:57.016
with a 3-D gun."?
Objection, Your Honor.
Argumentative.

15:57.050 --> 15:59.211
POLMAR: I'm just using
his own words, Your Honor.
Wait. wait.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.048
(overlapping chatter)
Wait. Wait, wait, wait
wait, wait, wait, wait.

16:02.090 --> 16:04.126
Mr. Fife, are these
your own words?

16:04.160 --> 16:07.095
Uh, if it was taken
from an interview on Noisy, yes.

16:07.130 --> 16:08.722
But they're always taken
out of context.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.263
Well, I'm sorry. Please.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.699
Supply the context.

16:12.730 --> 16:14.493
FIFE:
It... (sighs)

16:14.540 --> 16:17.407
I said, "I can't wait for the
first shooting with a 3-D gun,

16:17.440 --> 16:19.328
"'cause then we'll see_
how the government tries

16:19.370 --> 16:21.372
to suppress
the printing press."

16:21.410 --> 16:23.401
It was an intellectual argument.

16:23.450 --> 16:25.441
Yeah, accept you said,
"school shooting."

16:25.480 --> 16:30.417
Yes. I wa... Iwas...I_
was just being provocative.

16:30.450 --> 16:33.419
H was, I was trying to draw
attention to the issues.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.416
I would phrase it
differently now,

16:35.460 --> 16:38.281
Your Honor.
Good to know.

16:38.330 --> 16:41.128
$200,000.
Oh, come on, Nancy.
Let me take it to my client.

16:41.160 --> 16:43.390
(laughs)
If he's the good cop,

16:43.430 --> 16:45.421
but she's the bad one,
what does that make you two?

16:45.470 --> 16:47.734
Give us time to talk
to our client.
Come on.

16:47.770 --> 16:49.237
Be honest. The only reason
that you're not

16:49.270 --> 16:51.101
going after the shooter is
because he's broke.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.131
And it wasn't his fault.
We'll present the offer

16:53.180 --> 16:54.533
and get back to you.

16:54.580 --> 16:57.105
Okay.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.515
Okay.

17:03.550 --> 17:05.040
Well, I'm advising Eddie
to take it.

17:05.090 --> 17:07.183
That would be a mistake.
Crozier is on the run.

17:07.220 --> 17:10.053
She has a jackass for a client
and Abernathy on the bench.

17:10.090 --> 17:13.218
Yes, and $200,000 is double
what my client expected.
Our client.

17:13.260 --> 17:15.626
The client
that I brought to you.
For our judgment.

17:15.660 --> 17:17.821
Yeah, for your judgment, yeah,
but not for you politics.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.462
What does that mean?

17:19.500 --> 17:20.797
This case is about
a young father

17:20.840 --> 17:22.489
confined to a wheelchair
for the rest of his life.

17:22.540 --> 17:24.201
It's not about gun control.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.561
It's also not about the quick
fees you can make from $200,000.

17:26.610 --> 17:28.168
Still got some hard feelings
there, Cary?

17:28.210 --> 17:30.701
You mean from you trying
to put me in jail for 15 years?

17:30.750 --> 17:32.069
No, no.
That's ancient history.

17:32.110 --> 17:33.646
Okay, okay, let's
just take a breath.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.545
Let's ask the client
what he wants.

17:35.580 --> 17:37.741
Hmm?

17:37.790 --> 17:40.759
ELI:
When did the 2:30 tomorrow

17:40.790 --> 17:42.587
get moved to the Black
Business Leaders Lunch?

17:42.620 --> 17:45.088
She was supposed to be doing
the Rotary, but wha...?

17:45.130 --> 17:46.586
Why did they
get moved?

17:46.630 --> 17:47.824
I don't know.

17:47.860 --> 17:50.090
When did it get moved?

17:50.130 --> 17:51.324
An hour ago?

17:51.370 --> 17:53.133
What happened
an hour ago?

17:53.170 --> 17:55.263
I don't know.

17:57.140 --> 17:59.267
Why the Black Business Leaders?

17:59.310 --> 18:02.234
Prady's doing a speech there,
too, so...

18:04.150 --> 18:05.174
It's about Peter.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.802
It's about Prady
criticizing Peter.

18:06.850 --> 18:08.670
MARISSA:
I'm thinking of getting
a tramp stamp.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.642
What do you think?
She's not defending him, is she?

18:10.690 --> 18:12.248
She's throwing Peter
under the bus.

18:12.290 --> 18:14.315
It's about
his black hiring practices.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.248
MARISSA:
I have to go, Dad.
Take care.

18:16.290 --> 18:18.781
Marissa, get back in here!

18:18.830 --> 18:21.128
Rebecca Smercornish.
I'm a ballistics

18:21.160 --> 18:22.798
and modern trajectory expert
with the SAA.

18:22.830 --> 18:24.821
So, you're you want
to keep going?

18:24.870 --> 18:27.236
...I had a joint Justice
Department ATF working group

18:27.270 --> 18:28.532
looking into regulating
3D firearms.

18:28.570 --> 18:30.162
Did you happen to study

18:30.210 --> 18:32.201
under Mr. McVeigh,
the plaintiff's

18:32.240 --> 18:33.377
ballistics expert?
I did.

18:33.410 --> 18:35.230
CROZIER:
And do you have an opinion

18:35.280 --> 18:36.372
about the testimony
that he's given this afternoon?

18:36.410 --> 18:37.809
REBECCA:
I do.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.249
Mr. McVeigh is

18:39.280 --> 18:40.872
an excellent ballistics expert,

18:40.920 --> 18:42.444
but I'm afraid he's a bit...

18:42.480 --> 18:44.141
old school.

18:44.190 --> 18:47.159
He specializes in
trajectory analysis

18:47.190 --> 18:49.158
and gunshot residue
on any weapon

18:49.190 --> 18:51.158
produced in the last 100 years.

18:51.190 --> 18:52.282
But not wiki weapons.

18:52.330 --> 18:53.888
CROZIER: And when you
examined the gun

18:53.930 --> 18:55.295
at issue in this case,

18:55.330 --> 18:58.197
did you notice anything unusual?
I did.

18:58.230 --> 19:00.232
Uh... may I?

19:00.270 --> 19:02.898
I must admit, I worry about
turning this trial into a clinic

19:02.940 --> 19:04.339
on gun-making, but...
yeah, please.

19:05.940 --> 19:08.579
The CAD specs
provided by Mr. Fife

19:08.610 --> 19:10.407
are for his_
preferred ver5ion

19:10.450 --> 19:11.803
of the firearm.

19:11.850 --> 19:13.545
But given that the file
is open source,

19:13.580 --> 19:16.242
it's easy for a user
to tweak the design

19:16.280 --> 19:17.816
to his or
her taste.

19:17.850 --> 19:19.317
Can you give us an example?
Sure.

19:19.350 --> 19:22.456
Imagine you have small hands,
like I do.

19:22.490 --> 19:24.185
You just make an adjustment
to the program,

19:24.230 --> 19:26.824
and voil-_-
custom grip.

19:26.860 --> 19:28.919
And you can do that to any
part of the gun, easily.

19:28.960 --> 19:32.259
Did Mr. Pope make
any adjustments?

19:32.300 --> 19:34.188
Yes, he shortened
the barrel.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.559
Not a lot.

19:35.600 --> 19:37.465
By less than a 16th
of an inch, to 3.43.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.501
I'm certain that's why
Mr. McVeigh didn't catch it.

19:39.540 --> 19:41.838
CROZIER:
And could such a tweak

19:41.880 --> 19:43.347
have contributed
to the gun misfiring?

19:43.380 --> 19:44.904
REBECCA:
Yes.

19:44.950 --> 19:47.316
But could the designer
of the gun-- Mr. Fife--

19:47.350 --> 19:48.977
have done anything about this?

19:49.020 --> 19:50.942
Could he have prevented Mr. Pope
from making such a tweak?

19:50.990 --> 19:53.208
REBECCA:
No.

19:53.260 --> 19:53.954
The gun Mr. Pope brought
to the firing range

19:53.990 --> 19:55.355
was the one he made,

19:55.390 --> 19:56.857
with his own tweaks,

19:56.890 --> 19:58.448
for which he is
responsible.

19:58.490 --> 20:00.890
Mr. Pope is really the person
who should be sued here.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.958
But you can also
change the way

20:04.000 --> 20:05.422
a printer prints,
is that right?

20:05.470 --> 20:06.619
Yeah, it is.

20:06.670 --> 20:07.967
The quality of
plastic you use

20:08.000 --> 20:09.297
makes a big
difference, too.
Mm-hmm.

20:09.340 --> 20:10.637
As does your
infill setting...
Right.

20:10.670 --> 20:11.967
We're finding,
on the new...
Hello.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.376
May I have our
Mr. McVeigh for a moment?

20:14.410 --> 20:15.877
Yes.

20:15.910 --> 20:17.571
Definitely.

20:17.610 --> 20:18.747
Congratulations, by the way.

20:18.780 --> 20:20.441
I heard you
tied the knot.

20:20.480 --> 20:21.742
We did. Thanks.

20:21.780 --> 20:24.613
_ This is not _
an intellectual exerCIse.

20:24.650 --> 20:25.639
We're here to win, dear.

20:25.690 --> 20:27.453
Actually, you're
here to win.

20:27.490 --> 20:29.617
I'm here to testify.
For us.

20:29.660 --> 20:30.922
If they know
you have doubts,

20:30.960 --> 20:34.657
they'll put you back
on the stand to exploit them.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.554
Where are you going?

20:36.600 --> 20:38.989
To assuage my doubts.

20:39.030 --> 20:41.533
So, the Black Business Leaders.

20:41.570 --> 20:44.459
It's a good venue.
It's a very good venue
to trash Peter.

20:44.510 --> 20:46.466
Do I need to be here for this?
Yes. You're
supposed to be

20:46.510 --> 20:47.704
the adult here.
When he goes off

20:47.740 --> 20:48.934
on one of his crusades,
you steer.

20:48.980 --> 20:50.607
I am steering.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.878
It's the smart move,
and if you were here,

20:51.910 --> 20:53.878
instead of off
doing, uh, uh...

20:53.920 --> 20:55.615
Peter is finally making traction
with black voters

20:55.650 --> 20:57.618
and you're gonna screw it up.

20:57.650 --> 20:58.617
That's not our problem.
Yes, it is
your problem.

20:58.650 --> 20:59.787
You need Peter.

20:59.820 --> 21:01.014
You need the governor.

21:01.060 --> 21:02.687
There are three days left

21:02.720 --> 21:04.620
in the campaign, Eli.
We needed the governor.

21:04.660 --> 21:05.820
We don't now.

21:05.860 --> 21:07.555
We're up by three.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.022
You may not want Peter
as a friend,

21:09.060 --> 21:10.925
but you certainly don't
want him as an enemy.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.926
Oh-ho, what's that mean?
It doesn't mean anything.

21:12.970 --> 21:14.631
The governor's not going to
come out against his own wife.

21:17.570 --> 21:18.832
Josh, why don't you
give us a minute?

21:18.870 --> 21:21.634
Sure.

21:21.680 --> 21:22.999
Always a pleasure, Eli.

21:26.810 --> 21:28.744
I got you that job

21:28.780 --> 21:29.940
in California.
You did not get me
the job in California.

21:29.980 --> 21:31.538
You made a phone call.

21:31.590 --> 21:32.739
And I can withdraw that call.

21:35.090 --> 21:39.584
It's the kind of job that could
make someone's reputation.

21:39.630 --> 21:41.723
So you're gonna
bad-mouth me

21:41.760 --> 21:43.591
unless I pull back on
the Black Business Leaders?
Oh, yes.

21:43.630 --> 21:45.621
Wow.

21:47.770 --> 21:49.067
It's your choice, Jon.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.704
You want that job,

21:50.740 --> 21:52.605
you tell Alicia it's a bad idea
to trash Peter,

21:52.640 --> 21:55.507
because it is
a bad idea to trash Peter.

21:55.540 --> 21:58.668
You don't need it,
this late in the campaign.

21:58.710 --> 21:59.870
You know you don't.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.924
This is an exact replica of the
3-D gun that Carsten Pope fired.

22:13.960 --> 22:15.894
Including the tweak.

22:15.930 --> 22:18.626
So this gun should match the gun
that injured my client?

22:18.670 --> 22:20.888
Yes. It was also printed
on Pope's printer.

22:20.940 --> 22:23.431
You want to do the honors?
Mm.

22:23.470 --> 22:25.108
Just enough to
pull the trigger.

22:25.140 --> 22:27.700
Ready?

22:28.880 --> 22:31.371
DIANE:
Kurt, is that good?

22:31.410 --> 22:34.675
Maybe. I believe that we're
getting catastrophic failure

22:34.720 --> 22:38.679
from these guns because the
3-D printer was false feeding.

22:38.720 --> 22:41.018
False feeding?
Yeah. I noticed

22:41.060 --> 22:42.687
that the printer
was stuttering sometimes,

22:42.720 --> 22:44.927
when it was pulling the plastic
filament off the spool.

22:44.960 --> 22:46.120
Now, it resulted

22:46.160 --> 22:47.855
in some layers
being skipped,

22:47.900 --> 22:50.391
making the barrel too
weak in some places

22:50.430 --> 22:52.796
to contain the explosion
when a bullet's fired.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.036
But... is that
the designer's fault?

22:54.070 --> 22:55.935
No.

22:55.970 --> 22:57.801
I'll need to get
a different printer

22:57.840 --> 23:01.105
and test Fife's design with
and without the tweak.

23:01.140 --> 23:03.108
But it'll _take
some time.

23:03.140 --> 23:05.779
Uh, but as of now?

23:05.810 --> 23:09.473
My expert opinion is...
the printer's to blame.

23:09.520 --> 23:10.839
(blows)

23:10.890 --> 23:13.450
So you think
I have the wrong defendant?

23:13.490 --> 23:15.856
Yes.

23:18.830 --> 23:20.798
ALICIA: My husband
was a good state's attorney.

23:20.830 --> 23:22.457
But he made some mistakes.

23:22.500 --> 23:24.468
Some were front page news.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.627
Others weren't.

23:26.670 --> 23:27.739
There's this saying...

23:27.770 --> 23:30.136
(doorbell rings)

23:30.170 --> 23:32.058
There's this saying...

23:32.110 --> 23:33.907
Hi.

23:33.940 --> 23:35.828
You're early.
I thought we said 1:00.
We did.

23:35.880 --> 23:37.848
But I was thinking about the
Black Business Leaders speech.

23:37.880 --> 23:40.144
Oh, yes.
I was just working on it now.

23:40.180 --> 23:43.843
Well, I...
I'm having second thoughts.

23:43.890 --> 23:45.915
I think it's a mistake
to throw Peter under the bus.

23:45.950 --> 23:47.850
You do?

23:47.890 --> 23:49.858
I do. I'm worried about
you losmg more votes

23:49.890 --> 23:52.222
than you'd gain... old-time
supporters of his, Christians.

23:52.260 --> 23:54.228
We've hitched our wagon
to Peter from the beginning.

23:54.260 --> 23:56.854
I'm worried that we might end
up looking like opportunists.

23:56.900 --> 23:59.789
But what about countering
Prady's attack?

23:59.830 --> 24:01.866
I looked at the overnights--
the attack doesn't seem

24:01.900 --> 24:03.037
to leave much of a mark.

24:03.070 --> 24:04.867
I'm thinking we play
to our base.

24:04.910 --> 24:06.866
You sure?
Yes.

24:06.910 --> 24:09.936
For better or for worse,
you guys are a brand.

24:09.980 --> 24:11.868
You're the Florricks.
A package deal.

24:11.910 --> 24:14.014
This is the first speech.
It'll be on the teleprompters.

24:16.220 --> 24:17.812
Okay.

24:17.850 --> 24:20.683
Okay. I'll see you at 1:00.

24:20.720 --> 24:24.724
Why are you leaving
Election Day?

24:26.730 --> 24:29.528
This job in Sacramento.
It's a special election.

24:29.560 --> 24:32.063
They... they're in trouble.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.931
So it's not because of me.
Of us.

24:33.970 --> 24:35.164
No.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.998
Okay.
Okay.

24:42.040 --> 24:44.179
What's this?

24:44.210 --> 24:46.644
I don't know.
It's too far away.

24:46.680 --> 24:47.874
What is it?
You amended the suit.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.980
Oh, yes, we did.
Based on your test.

24:51.020 --> 24:52.988
We're suing the maker
of the printer.
But you're still suing

24:53.020 --> 24:55.079
Chris Fife, even though his
design isn't the problem.

24:55.120 --> 24:58.283
Fife's Web site links
to the faulty printer.

24:58.330 --> 25:01.197
He specifically advocates
its use, so we're able

25:01.230 --> 25:04.199
to backdoor him.
You don't believe that
he is legally negligent.

25:04.230 --> 25:06.118
You just think he's
politically offensive.

25:06.170 --> 25:07.660
I think he's both.

25:07.700 --> 25:09.292
He's making it possible
for anyone to make

25:09.340 --> 25:11.729
an untraceable,
untrackable gun.

25:11.770 --> 25:14.204
Who do you think will use it?
That's not a question
for lawyers.

25:14.240 --> 25:16.936
That's for politicians.
You want to run? Run.

25:18.880 --> 25:20.302
We need you to testify, Kurt.

25:20.350 --> 25:23.114
I need you
to testify.
No.

25:23.150 --> 25:26.017
Not for a crusade.

25:29.860 --> 25:31.953
You can talk to him.

25:31.990 --> 25:33.594
Oh, that's all right.

25:33.630 --> 25:35.120
It helps.

25:35.160 --> 25:37.799
Squeeze his hand
and talk to him.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.606
Hi.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.881
So...

26:04.260 --> 26:06.057
I'm here because I need to know

26:06.090 --> 26:08.752
what you want me to do
with your money, Mr. Canning.

26:08.800 --> 26:12.998
This family, they want to give
it to a Palestinian charity,

26:13.030 --> 26:16.033
but it might have
illegal ties...

26:17.040 --> 26:20.259
(chuckles)

26:20.310 --> 26:25.338
She probably means talk
about something personal.

26:25.380 --> 26:29.248
My daughter's praying for you,
so that's good.

26:29.280 --> 26:32.989
I'm not. Because that
would be hypocritical.

26:43.200 --> 26:47.022
I don't want you to die,
Mr. Canning, okay?

26:48.140 --> 26:51.860
I know you're a bad man, but...

26:51.910 --> 26:54.208
(chuckles)

26:55.380 --> 26:58.770
...I sort of miss you.

26:59.780 --> 27:01.748
I know. That's weird.

27:01.780 --> 27:03.782
I don't know why.

27:06.220 --> 27:09.712
I seem to have some...

27:09.760 --> 27:11.728
bad boy issues.

27:11.760 --> 27:14.627
(wry laugh)

27:21.270 --> 27:24.398
Get well, Mr. Canning.

27:37.180 --> 27:38.386
Okay.

27:38.420 --> 27:41.685
I am gonna get your money
to that charity.

27:47.030 --> 27:49.328
Bye.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.364
(low, indistinct chatter,
footsteps approaching)

27:57.970 --> 28:00.029
MARISSA:
You're a real dirtbag,

28:00.070 --> 28:01.879
you know that?
No, I didn't know that.

28:01.910 --> 28:03.229
You're letting
my dad bully you.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.838
Marissa, you don't know what
you're talking about.

28:04.880 --> 28:06.404
He threatened
to yank your next job

28:06.450 --> 28:08.839
unless you advised Alicia
to back down.

28:08.880 --> 28:10.313
Alicia and Peter are better off
standing together.

28:10.350 --> 28:12.079
They're a package deal.
Package deal.

28:12.120 --> 28:13.917
Yeah, I heard my dad say it
already, dirtbag.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.211
Well, then Marissa, why don't
you leave me alone, okay?

28:15.260 --> 28:17.012
Your job is to give her

28:17.060 --> 28:18.425
ChapStick and breath mints,
not bust my balls.

28:18.460 --> 28:21.725
God, handsome men are so weak.

28:33.540 --> 28:35.872
Kurt McVeigh?

28:35.910 --> 28:38.276
Yeah?
You've been served.

28:38.310 --> 28:39.402
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:39.450 --> 28:41.042
Who's it from?

28:41.080 --> 28:43.378
Diane Lockhart.

28:52.930 --> 28:55.148
So you used the same BlockStock
3-D printer to make your gun

28:55.200 --> 28:58.328
as Carsten Pope did?

29:06.170 --> 29:07.432
Yes.

29:10.080 --> 29:12.048
And would you characterize it

29:12.080 --> 29:14.048
as a smooth process?

29:16.880 --> 29:19.747
I have nothing to compare it to.

29:22.020 --> 29:23.510
(chuckles)

29:23.560 --> 29:25.152
I think your, uh,

29:25.190 --> 29:27.488
witness would appreciate
some specificity.

29:27.530 --> 29:29.191
Let me rephrase.

29:29.230 --> 29:33.291
Did you find that when
you were making the gun...

29:33.330 --> 29:35.195
the printer stuttered?

29:36.240 --> 29:38.003
Yes.

29:38.040 --> 29:39.359
Were you able to determine why?

29:39.410 --> 29:44.803
There was too much friction
in the feed tube.

29:48.220 --> 29:51.144
And what effect _did this have
on the resulting print?
It prevented

29:51.190 --> 29:53.909
the layers of plastic
from being applied evenly.

29:53.960 --> 29:56.155
So when you test-fired the gun,
what happened?

29:56.190 --> 29:57.509
It misfired.
So would you say

29:57.560 --> 29:59.152
that the fault for this lies

29:59.190 --> 30:02.091
with BlockStock, the designer
of the 3-D printer?

30:03.260 --> 30:05.194
Yes.

30:05.230 --> 30:09.394
Your Honor, no offense to my
codefendants, but I fail to see

30:09.440 --> 30:11.908
how Mr. McVeigh's testimony
is relevant to my client.

30:11.940 --> 30:13.567
Uh, Ms. Lockhart,
would you care to enlighten us?

30:13.610 --> 30:16.238
Mr. Fife's Web site links
to the BlockStock

30:16.280 --> 30:17.907
3-D printer site.
Your Honor,

30:17.950 --> 30:20.168
_ _that connection
is ridiculously tenuous.

30:20.210 --> 30:22.144
POLMAR: It's joint and
several liability,

30:22.180 --> 30:23.545
Your Honor.

30:23.580 --> 30:26.048
Mr. Fife and BlockStock
were both negligent here.

30:26.090 --> 30:28.411
Therefore we can and should be
able to recover damages

30:28.460 --> 30:30.985
from both.
Makes sense to me.

30:31.030 --> 30:33.351
Mr. Fife should make himself
comfortable.

30:47.940 --> 30:50.909
So don't you want Diane here
and not me?

30:50.950 --> 30:53.271
No.

30:53.310 --> 30:56.143
This is the feed tube from
Carsten Pope's printer.

30:56.180 --> 30:59.081
Look through it.
Sure.

30:59.120 --> 31:01.111
I can't.
It's clogged.

31:01.160 --> 31:03.014
After Carsten Pope
printed his gun,

31:03.060 --> 31:05.187
he made several
coffee mugs.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.892
Okay, well,
that's oddly innocuous.

31:07.930 --> 31:10.319
You think that's what
caused the misfire,
mixing the plastics?

31:10.360 --> 31:12.328
I don't know.
That's why we test.

31:16.370 --> 31:18.338
Well, it's intact.

31:18.370 --> 31:20.235
So... that's bad?

31:20.270 --> 31:21.999
Maybe.

31:22.040 --> 31:23.632
Well, the printer
worked fine,

31:23.680 --> 31:25.238
which means that the company's
not at fault.

31:25.280 --> 31:27.248
Yeah, it also means
that the gun Pope fired

31:27.280 --> 31:29.111
wasn't based on a
bad design either.

31:29.150 --> 31:31.038
Right. Good.
Except, you know...
We have no idea

31:31.090 --> 31:33.388
why the gun failed.
Yeah.

31:33.420 --> 31:36.651
But the first order of
business is dropping BlockStock

31:36.690 --> 31:39.250
from the_ suit.
They did nothing wrong.

31:39.290 --> 31:41.656
Yeah.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.362
MAN:
BBL has always been about...

31:44.400 --> 31:46.664
WOMAN:
Do you want anything
for your hair?

31:46.700 --> 31:48.190
No. I'm good. Thank you.

31:48.240 --> 31:49.389
Okay.

31:52.740 --> 31:55.379
You think our campaign managers
know we're alone in here?

31:55.410 --> 31:58.208
I think our campaign
managers think

31:58.250 --> 31:59.603
we're running off together.
(chuckles)

31:59.650 --> 32:01.618
We could do worse.

32:01.650 --> 32:04.414
(phone ringing)

32:04.450 --> 32:07.044
Go ahead. I don't mind.
No.

32:07.090 --> 32:09.957
I'm sick of phones.
It's always bad news.

32:09.990 --> 32:11.423
Not for you these days.

32:11.460 --> 32:13.428
Not that I'm
following the polls.

32:13.460 --> 32:16.122
Oh, I think
it's too close to call.

32:16.160 --> 32:17.696
Oh, I don't think it is.

32:17.730 --> 32:19.698
Whenever I think
I'm certain about something,

32:19.730 --> 32:21.129
I'm always surprised.

32:21.170 --> 32:24.207
It's a bad process, isn't it?

32:24.240 --> 32:26.128
Horrible.

32:26.170 --> 32:29.708
Anything you'd do
differently?

32:30.710 --> 32:32.371
I'd be more honest.

32:34.250 --> 32:36.241
How 'bout you?

32:36.280 --> 32:38.145
The debate.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.441
Oh, right.
(chuckles)

32:39.490 --> 32:41.708
And the closeted charge.
I would answer it.

32:41.760 --> 32:43.250
You still can.

32:43.290 --> 32:45.178
No one thinks
it's wrong to be gay.

32:49.300 --> 32:52.098
Who else but your opponent?

32:53.230 --> 32:56.097
I'm not gay. I'm a Jesuit.

33:00.370 --> 33:02.179
because you only
get married once.

33:02.210 --> 33:05.646
To remarry is
to commit adultery.

33:05.680 --> 33:08.444
It's the God's
honest truth.

33:08.480 --> 33:10.744
Wh... Why didn't you say that?

33:10.780 --> 33:13.283
Well, we didn't
want to lose the gay vote

33:13.320 --> 33:17.154
and-and... besides,
it makes you look weird.

33:17.190 --> 33:19.488
What person in
this day and age

33:19.530 --> 33:21.725
takes Jesus
Christ seriously

33:21.760 --> 33:23.728
when he says,
"You can't divorce"?

33:23.760 --> 33:26.024
Not someone you
want to get a beer with.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.801
You are...

33:31.840 --> 33:33.728
better than I am.

33:33.770 --> 33:35.499
(chuckles):
No.

33:35.540 --> 33:37.303
Oh, yeah.

33:37.340 --> 33:39.774
Unfortunately.

33:41.220 --> 33:42.312
(soft knocking at door)

33:42.350 --> 33:44.147
Well...

33:48.220 --> 33:50.051
It's been good fighting you.

33:50.090 --> 33:51.523
Good luck on your speech.

33:51.560 --> 33:53.824
Think I should
put something in my hair?

33:53.860 --> 33:55.452
No.

33:55.500 --> 33:58.219
You're perfect.

34:21.190 --> 34:23.283
(line ringing)

34:23.320 --> 34:25.288
Hello, Eli, how are you?

34:25.330 --> 34:26.558
Well, that depends.
Are you sending money

34:26.590 --> 34:28.148
to the Palestinians?

34:31.430 --> 34:34.137
I hate these silences, Alicia.

34:34.170 --> 34:37.298
Where are you hearing this, Eli?
I just got a call from a friend
in the Justice Department.

34:37.340 --> 34:39.433
He asked me to check
if you're funding some...

34:39.470 --> 34:41.404
pro-Palestinian charity
based in Detroit.

34:41.440 --> 34:42.600
It's Dearborn.

34:42.640 --> 34:44.608
And no, I'm not.
Alicia, what the hell?

34:44.650 --> 34:47.505
You're sending money to Hamas?
No, it's not me,

34:47.550 --> 34:49.245
it's Louis Canning.
He's sick,

34:49.280 --> 34:50.440
and he wanted
to do something nice...

34:50.480 --> 34:52.812
What, send money to Hamas?
...for the

34:52.850 --> 34:54.454
donor of his kidney.

34:54.490 --> 34:58.529
They wanted to give money
to this charity, and...

34:58.560 --> 35:02.519
there's a possibility
that this charity...

35:02.560 --> 35:04.596
might be connected to Hamas.

35:04.630 --> 35:06.564
So I was checking on it
for him, that's all.

35:06.600 --> 35:08.693
Why were you checking?
Because he asked me to

35:08.740 --> 35:11.561
and David Lee wouldn't.
So I did.

35:12.770 --> 35:15.603
Oh, Alicia, you're being set up.

35:15.640 --> 35:16.709
What? What are you...

35:16.740 --> 35:18.605
This Canning guy
is suing you, right?

35:18.650 --> 35:20.675
And David Lee is no friend,
and they both found a way

35:20.710 --> 35:23.747
for you to check
on giving money to Hamas.
He's on his deathbed, Eli.

35:23.780 --> 35:27.341
Canning's not gonna
prank me on his deathbed.

35:27.390 --> 35:30.587
Why not?
Because...

35:30.620 --> 35:32.827
I don't know.
I'm giving up.

35:32.860 --> 35:35.249
Good-bye.

35:40.770 --> 35:42.533
What's wrong?

35:42.570 --> 35:45.437
Nothing.
What do you mean?

35:45.470 --> 35:47.529
You look like
something's wrong.

35:47.570 --> 35:49.731
No, but there's been a change.
You look great.

35:49.780 --> 35:51.702
Thanks. What changed?

35:51.750 --> 35:53.479
Go after Peter.

35:53.510 --> 35:55.774
Go after him?
Yes, for racial disparities

35:55.820 --> 35:58.789
when he was SA. I gave the
new speech to the teleprompter.

35:58.820 --> 36:00.617
What changed?

36:00.650 --> 36:03.380
Nothing. I was wrong.
This is the smart thing to do.

36:03.420 --> 36:04.626
(applause and cheering
in distance)

36:04.660 --> 36:07.549
Oh, that's Prady.
He's doing well.

36:07.590 --> 36:09.524
Yeah. You're next.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.699
Go after Peter.
Kill him.

36:11.730 --> 36:14.563
No mercy.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.591
Okay.

36:18.910 --> 36:21.572
FIFE:
Oh-ho, yeah!

36:21.610 --> 36:26.400
Welcome to the Freedom Factory.
Just-Just signed the lease

36:26.450 --> 36:28.771
and got a copy
of the keys right here.

36:28.820 --> 36:31.641
We finally have all this,
this elbow room.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.544
And-and the... the heater works.

36:33.590 --> 36:36.559
I, I think about all the time
and money, uh, we wasted

36:36.590 --> 36:38.524
trying to print
in my parents' garage.

36:38.560 --> 36:40.778
Yeah, we're not gonna miss
that damn icebox.

36:40.830 --> 36:42.422
(taps key)

36:42.460 --> 36:44.599
(phone ringing)

36:47.470 --> 36:49.961
McVeigh.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.900
I'm sorry... what?

36:51.940 --> 36:53.999
Have you tried printing the gun

36:54.040 --> 36:55.803
in a cold-temperature
environment?

36:55.840 --> 36:56.909
Have I...?
(stammers)

36:56.940 --> 36:58.840
Who is this?
Kalinda.

36:58.880 --> 37:01.576
See, low or fluctuating
temperatures can impede

37:01.620 --> 37:04.487
the layers of plastic
from adhering correctly.

37:08.860 --> 37:09.451
(applause)

37:09.490 --> 37:10.752
Every politician struggles

37:10.790 --> 37:12.678
with the 11th Commandment.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.425
Speak no ill

37:14.460 --> 37:16.690
of your fellow party member.

37:16.730 --> 37:18.789
Because sometimes
you just disagree.

37:18.830 --> 37:21.799
But when that disagreement
is with someone

37:21.840 --> 37:24.468
who is not just
a fellow traveler, but...

37:24.510 --> 37:26.307
in my case, a spouse,

37:26.340 --> 37:28.706
it gets even more complicated.

37:28.740 --> 37:30.799
Because the most_ insidious
form of raCIsm

37:30.840 --> 37:32.774
is unconscious and exists
in our legal system.

37:32.810 --> 37:34.414
(line ringing)

37:34.450 --> 37:36.941
My husband was
a good state's attorney.

37:36.980 --> 37:38.948
But he made some mistakes.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.639
JOHNNY: Eli?
Consider yourself out of a job,

37:40.690 --> 37:41.884
you son of a bitch.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.059
Well, you do
what you have to do, Eli.

37:44.090 --> 37:46.479
I'm running a campaign.
It's already done.

37:46.530 --> 37:48.293
Enjoy the speech.

37:48.330 --> 37:51.493
ALICIA: There's the saying
"Racism without racist."

37:51.530 --> 37:54.966
I think this perfectly
describes Cook County

37:55.000 --> 37:56.934
and the SA's Office.

37:56.970 --> 37:58.961
(applause)

38:05.380 --> 38:06.699
I think about all the time
and money, uh, we wasted

38:06.750 --> 38:07.876
trying to print
in my parents' garage.

38:07.910 --> 38:09.775
We're not gonna miss
that damn icebox.

38:09.820 --> 38:13.085
You knew that printing in cold
temperatures warps the plastic

38:13.120 --> 38:15.418
and weakens the structure
of the gun, didn't you?

38:15.460 --> 38:19.419
This... is a new field

38:19.460 --> 38:21.928
with a lot of variables...
A Simple yes or no, please.

38:21.960 --> 38:22.892
Yes.

38:22.930 --> 38:24.420
And did you offer any warning

38:24.470 --> 38:25.892
as to the effect
of cold temperatures

38:25.930 --> 38:27.466
on the printing process?

38:27.500 --> 38:29.889
No, no, but buyer
needs to beware.

38:33.110 --> 38:35.829
Five million.

38:37.140 --> 38:38.448
(clears throat)
Excuse me?

38:38.480 --> 38:39.902
You have to
drop the suit

38:39.950 --> 38:41.577
and sign this
nondisclosure agreement.

38:41.620 --> 38:42.939
Fife doesn't have
that kind of insurance.

38:42.980 --> 38:44.538
Where is the money
coming from?

38:44.590 --> 38:45.841
An interested party
has been following the case.

38:45.890 --> 38:47.118
The NRA?

38:47.150 --> 38:48.811
No, private individuals
who understand

38:48.860 --> 38:50.111
the importance
of this evolving issue,

38:50.160 --> 38:52.128
and would be willing
to underwrite Fife's defense.

38:52.160 --> 38:53.787
We have a right to know.

38:53.830 --> 38:55.058
No, actually, you don't.

38:55.100 --> 38:56.829
But you have the right

38:56.860 --> 38:59.420
to take it, Mr. Summerfeldt,
and drop this suit.

38:59.470 --> 39:01.995
Or you don't... and then

39:02.040 --> 39:03.996
my mysterious benefactor

39:04.040 --> 39:06.031
uses his bounty of treasure
to destroy you.

39:07.610 --> 39:09.430
So, what do you say,
Mr. Summerfeldt?

39:11.880 --> 39:13.848
CANNING:
Alicia?

39:13.880 --> 39:15.575
How are you today?
Good.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.872
Looks like you might be, too.
Yeah.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.945
Getting stronger.
Good.

39:19.990 --> 39:21.514
So, are you setting me up?

39:24.020 --> 39:27.057
Am I, am I,
am I setting you up?

39:27.090 --> 39:29.058
The 18 million
you wanted donated--

39:29.100 --> 39:31.022
is that a scheme
with David Lee?

39:31.060 --> 39:33.824
I really have...

39:33.870 --> 39:35.895
no idea what you're
talking about.

39:35.940 --> 39:37.532
You wanted
your stocks liquidated

39:37.570 --> 39:39.765
and given
to a Palestinian charity?

39:39.810 --> 39:41.732
I-I what...?
The donor's family.

39:41.780 --> 39:43.998
You wanted
18 million given to them.

39:44.040 --> 39:45.701
You wanted to do good.

39:45.750 --> 39:47.001
No, I didn't!
What do you mean,

39:47.050 --> 39:47.778
what do you mean
I want to do good?

39:47.810 --> 39:49.710
You don't remember
the conversation

39:49.750 --> 39:51.843
we had yesterday?
You gave me power of attorney.

39:51.890 --> 39:53.187
Alicia, what the hell?!
Where's my money?!

39:53.220 --> 39:55.154
Well, there were
some complications.

39:55.190 --> 39:56.589
That's why I'm here.

39:56.620 --> 39:57.882
Anesthesia plus
tremor meds.

39:57.920 --> 40:00.718
I was in a, in a, in a,
in a fugue state!

40:00.760 --> 40:02.819
I can't... Where, where,
where's my money?!

40:04.500 --> 40:05.922
Right where it belongs.

40:05.970 --> 40:07.562
With David Lee.

40:07.600 --> 40:09.158
Oh, thank God!
Hmm.

40:09.200 --> 40:10.690
Okay.

40:10.740 --> 40:12.708
I'm going now.

40:12.740 --> 40:14.708
This was... great.

40:14.740 --> 40:16.469
Always fun talking to you.

40:16.510 --> 40:17.977
Alicia, wait!

40:18.010 --> 40:19.648
Can you, can you
hand me my phone?

40:23.150 --> 40:26.540
You mean... this phone here?

40:26.590 --> 40:27.989
Yeah, you know,
don't-don't kid around.

40:28.020 --> 40:29.055
Just hand me the phone.

40:29.090 --> 40:30.489
No.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.488
I think it looks good

40:32.530 --> 40:33.929
right...

40:33.960 --> 40:35.928
there.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.928
Alicia...
Good seeing you, Mr. Canning.

40:37.960 --> 40:39.564
(phone ringing)
Oh, now it's ringing!

40:39.600 --> 40:41.124
Can you get...? What...?

40:41.170 --> 40:42.660
Nurse!

40:54.150 --> 40:56.209
Just came to see
how you were domg.

40:56.250 --> 40:59.617
I'll be fine.

40:59.650 --> 41:02.949
But I think I owe
you an apology.

41:02.990 --> 41:05.720
I let my political passions

41:05.760 --> 41:08.058
drive a wedge between us.

41:08.090 --> 41:11.196
And that's never
been how we do things.

41:13.730 --> 41:15.095
True.

41:16.870 --> 41:20.135
Oh, he of few words.

41:29.050 --> 41:31.075
I think we need
to go away together.

41:31.120 --> 41:33.748
Good.

41:33.790 --> 41:36.884
What do you think about
a week in Italy this May?

41:36.920 --> 41:38.922
The Amalfi Coast.

41:38.960 --> 41:42.691
Actually, I was, uh,
thinking more like tomorrow.

41:42.730 --> 41:46.518
I can't get away for a week.

41:46.570 --> 41:48.697
Yeah, I know.

41:48.740 --> 41:52.107
Three days
of deer hunting in Wyoming

41:52.140 --> 41:54.574
with the richest men
in the country.

41:59.650 --> 42:02.073
Sure, let's go.

42:02.120 --> 42:05.214
* One, two, one,
two, three, four... *

42:13.590 --> 42:14.818
Hi. I thought you were out.

42:14.860 --> 42:15.952
I was out.

42:16.000 --> 42:16.898
Just getting back.

42:16.930 --> 42:19.160
Uh, listen, I didn't get
to congratulate you.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.326
The speech went very well.

42:20.370 --> 42:21.735
It did. Thanks.

42:21.770 --> 42:23.863
So, another 48 hours.

42:23.900 --> 42:25.800
Yeah, yeah.
There's a story out

42:25.840 --> 42:27.159
that you're supporting Hamas?

42:27.210 --> 42:29.804
I don't need to worry
about that, do I?

42:29.840 --> 42:32.047
No.
Good.

42:33.680 --> 42:36.114
Um... listen,
I'm not very...

42:36.150 --> 42:40.018
not very good at expressing
my feelings, uh...

42:40.050 --> 42:42.780
so I don't
really like to...

42:44.390 --> 42:46.756
Do you want to come inside?

42:46.790 --> 42:48.655
No, no, no. Ijust...
I don't know.

42:48.700 --> 42:51.669
I-I don't know.
You know what? Oh, whatever.
