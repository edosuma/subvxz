WEBVTT

01:26.753 --> 01:30.130
Rise and shine. Let's go.
Gonna miss the bus. Get up.

01:30.298 --> 01:31.882
Please stop acting like Dad.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.928
Boy, I don't got time for this.
Get up. I'm gonna be late.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.055
Your lunch is in the kitchen.

02:24.894 --> 02:26.812
Come on, man.

02:37.574 --> 02:40.784
Negative on that, Control.
We're short-handed already.

03:03.099 --> 03:07.269
Now, that's what I'm talking about.
M4 Benelli scattergun.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.646
State of the art.

03:11.774 --> 03:12.774
Yeah, boys.

03:13.276 --> 03:17.404
I wish somebody would mess with us
on the-- What?

03:18.489 --> 03:20.866
Looks like the devil made that.

03:21.576 --> 03:23.744
Cut the shit, Palmer.

03:24.329 --> 03:27.581
You and the devil was real tight
not too long ago, huh?

03:28.208 --> 03:30.500
God saved my life, yes...

03:31.294 --> 03:33.337
...and he could still save yours.

03:34.130 --> 03:36.298
-What's up?
-Good morning.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.718
-Good morning.
-Yo, yo, little Mike.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.637
Check this baby out.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.306
What do you think of that?

03:44.474 --> 03:46.266
Looks like you're overcompensating.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.102
What are you talking about?

03:49.270 --> 03:51.521
-What am I talking about?
-What you talking about?

03:51.689 --> 03:55.817
You know what they say.
Bigger the gun, smaller the pistol.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.490
Okay, okay.
Good one, good one, good one.

04:01.658 --> 04:05.118
Oh, you know. Shit, I'm gonna
remember that shit. That's all right.

04:05.286 --> 04:08.747
Next Monday,
Teams 1, 3, 5 and 7...

04:08.915 --> 04:13.502
...will commence training
on the new 425X7 ACTs.

04:13.670 --> 04:17.547
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are entering the modern age.

04:17.714 --> 04:21.635
All new trucks
will be equipped with GPS.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.304
This is mandatory training...

04:25.223 --> 04:27.599
...and I will accept no excuses.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.351
No hall passes.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.393
Ten-four, Control.

05:13.187 --> 05:16.481
Eagle Shield 32,
check in on your next job.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.693
Yeah, Eagle Shield 32.

05:19.861 --> 05:24.072
Yeah, we're 10-5 on that drop.

05:27.285 --> 05:29.494
Twenty minutes, 32.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.164
Yeah, 10-4, thanks.

05:33.541 --> 05:38.128
Your next scheduled check-in after
drop will be in 30 minutes. Stand by.

05:41.591 --> 05:45.177
Eagle 24, we're 2400 block,
Madison.

05:47.221 --> 05:50.349
Two-four, stand by.
Tow is en route to 24.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.190
What's going on?

05:58.358 --> 06:01.068
I got a black van.
He circled us twice.

06:03.154 --> 06:05.655
All right, eyes and ears open.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.574
Ten-four.

06:10.078 --> 06:13.163
I wish they would try something.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.297
Whoa, whoa, what's going on?

07:09.846 --> 07:11.346
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

07:11.514 --> 07:13.974
Ty, keep your eyes open.

07:16.519 --> 07:20.021
-I don't know. She just cut out on me.
-Check your gauges.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.442
Everything looks good.

07:23.609 --> 07:25.735
Hey, wait, whoa, whoa.

07:25.903 --> 07:27.696
You smell that? Anybody smell that?

07:27.864 --> 07:30.866
Sm-- Smell-- Smell what?
I don't smell nothing, Baines.

07:31.033 --> 07:35.036
I smell it. Burnt sugar.
Somebody got to the fuel line.

07:35.204 --> 07:37.038
-No, this ain't good.
-Team 12 to Base.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.332
-This ain't good.
-Team 12 to Base, come in.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.626
Keep keying that thing.
Keep keying it.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.212
Team 12 to Base, come in,
goddamn it. Where are you?

07:44.380 --> 07:47.090
-We got a code black here.
-Come on. What's going on?

07:47.258 --> 07:50.218
-Keep keying the thing.
-I am, I am, I'm trying.

07:51.053 --> 07:53.013
Come on.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.890
Team 12 to Base, come in.

07:55.057 --> 07:57.058
Where the hell are you?
We got a code black.

07:57.226 --> 07:59.060
-We're in a dead zone.
-Damn.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.564
Holy shit.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.318
Holy shit, holy shit. Holy shit!

08:08.905 --> 08:10.572
-Seat belt's stuck.
-Hit the deep locks.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.240
My seat belt's stuck.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.578
-Keep keying it! Keep keying it!
-She won't turn over!

08:19.207 --> 08:20.707
Bomb!

08:21.792 --> 08:27.714
Come on.

08:27.882 --> 08:30.383
She won't turn over.
She won't turn over!

08:41.145 --> 08:44.188
-I can't take it.
-"Bomb!"

08:45.358 --> 08:47.025
-We got you, man.
-We got you, man.

08:47.193 --> 08:48.902
We got you.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.780
Oh, buddy, you did great.

08:51.948 --> 08:54.616
-You were quiet in the crisis, man.
-Jesus.

09:00.748 --> 09:02.791
Oh, no, can't get his belt off!

09:05.753 --> 09:08.296
You should have seen
the look on your face.

09:08.464 --> 09:11.466
Don't worry. Dobbsie was crying
when we did it to him.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.468
No, no, no. Don't-- Don't--

09:13.636 --> 09:16.513
We had to change your diaper.
What the hell--?

09:16.681 --> 09:18.139
Hey, hey, hey.

09:18.307 --> 09:20.392
I tried to stop them, bro, all right?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.143
You're supposed to have my back.

09:22.311 --> 09:24.563
Hold on. Hold on.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.983
I got something I'd like to say.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.818
Hold on a second.

09:30.903 --> 09:34.739
You know, when your old man
asked me to be your godfather...

09:34.907 --> 09:37.200
...that was a big moment in my life.

09:37.368 --> 09:41.288
He was a great mentor to me...

09:41.455 --> 09:44.666
...and he was--
He was my best friend.

09:45.001 --> 09:49.296
I don't know how much of this
he expressed to you...

09:49.463 --> 09:53.174
...how deeply proud he was of you
when you joined the service.

09:54.468 --> 09:58.305
And I know both he and your mom
would be proud...

09:58.472 --> 10:03.351
...to see the way that you stepped up
for your brother, Jimmy.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.021
-Real proud.
-Yeah.

10:06.188 --> 10:07.689
And I'm proud of you too.

10:08.024 --> 10:12.944
So let's take a moment
to lift up our glasses to Ty.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.030
-To Ty, Jr.
-To Ty.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.198
-Ty.
-Ty.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.284
You passed your probation.

10:19.452 --> 10:20.869
Starting tomorrow...

10:21.037 --> 10:24.456
...you're a full-fledged guard
with Eagle Shield Security.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.875
-To Eagle Shield.
-Eagle Shield!

10:27.168 --> 10:28.877
Eagle Shield Security.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.963
-Ty.
-Here's to it.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.760
They dropped a power line
on the truck.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.803
Fifty thousand volts.

10:38.971 --> 10:41.139
Fried everybody inside.

10:41.641 --> 10:44.059
They were lucky they went fast.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.936
-Remember Omaha?
-Oh, man.

10:47.104 --> 10:49.898
Yeah, they tried to use
a demolition charge to blow the door.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.150
The door held...

10:52.318 --> 10:54.402
...but the fuel tank went up in flames.

10:54.570 --> 10:57.072
They were cooked alive.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.825
So has Eagle Shield
ever got jacked?

11:00.993 --> 11:04.913
Once. A couple of guards
got killed in a five-man ambush.

11:05.748 --> 11:07.165
How much they get?

11:07.333 --> 11:12.087
Not one dollar. The last guard
in the crew dropped all five of them.

11:12.254 --> 11:14.839
-One guard?
-Yes.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.257
Ashcroft.

11:17.301 --> 11:19.719
Ashcroft? Our Ashcroft?

11:19.887 --> 11:22.430
-That's why he's got the cane.
-No.

11:22.598 --> 11:25.600
Still carrying a couple of slugs
in his back.

11:25.768 --> 11:29.479
I got an even better one.
Back in October of '88...

11:29.647 --> 11:33.108
...a crew making a $4-million
cash transfer to Abilene...

11:33.484 --> 11:35.318
...stopped at a car accident.

11:35.486 --> 11:38.780
Only it wasn't an accident,
it was a setup.

11:38.948 --> 11:42.617
The guard who got out of the truck,
well, they just grabbed him...

11:42.785 --> 11:45.620
...put a sawed-off shotgun
to the back of his head.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.123
Then what happened?

11:48.416 --> 11:52.585
Crew just gave up the money
and they let the guard go.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.337
The guards just gave up the money?

11:54.505 --> 11:58.425
It was either that
or sacrifice one of their brothers.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.969
The funny thing about it is...

12:01.137 --> 12:04.097
...they still never caught up
with those hijackers.

12:04.265 --> 12:06.224
-Right?
-Nope.

12:06.976 --> 12:09.602
And they never
found that money either.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.731
See...

12:12.898 --> 12:15.692
...not everybody's a hero, soldier boy.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.784
So when are you gonna tell us
about all them kills...

12:24.952 --> 12:27.328
...you got over there in Baghdad?

12:28.289 --> 12:30.331
We'd like to hear about that.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.959
I gotta take a leak.

12:40.134 --> 12:42.135
You're out of line, man.

12:58.819 --> 13:01.821
You should be proud
of what you did over there.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.868
I'm not.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.454
A lot of innocent people
died out there.

13:09.622 --> 13:14.918
Right, right. But you were just trying
to protect the guys in your unit.

13:16.921 --> 13:19.297
Those guys were your brothers.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.759
Anybody would've done
the same thing.

13:25.513 --> 13:29.390
So you'd think.
That's what you'd think.

13:34.688 --> 13:36.731
We're not gonna let the bank
take your house.

13:36.899 --> 13:40.193
-I got that under control.
-Hey, don't bullshit me, Ty.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.905
Don't worry about it.
We're gonna think of something.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.663
All right.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.414
Say hi to Jimmy.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.960
-Drive safe, man.
-All right.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.809
Jimmy.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.732
Jimmy?

14:23.070 --> 14:24.529
Jimmy, let's eat.

14:36.500 --> 14:38.084
Jimmy.

14:40.462 --> 14:42.130
Jimmy!

14:45.009 --> 14:47.093
What are you doing?

14:48.470 --> 14:51.639
Your bedroom is one thing.
You know this is the kitchen, right?

14:54.518 --> 14:55.935
What's for dinner?

14:57.146 --> 14:58.980
I'm starved.

14:59.481 --> 15:00.815
"I'm starved."

15:01.150 --> 15:03.651
You're really testing me, bro.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.493
Every day.

15:12.661 --> 15:16.080
-Every day, it's something with you.
-What took you so long?

15:16.832 --> 15:18.499
What took--? No, Jimmy.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.418
Where'd you get the supplies?

15:20.586 --> 15:24.130
You ain't getting no money from me,
so where are you getting it, Jimmy?

15:24.298 --> 15:28.092
You better not be stealing it from
the store. Where'd you get them?

15:28.260 --> 15:31.137
No, man. I'm not stealing them
from the store.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.389
Okay, tell me something.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.852
But school has a real nice supply.

15:40.814 --> 15:42.482
School.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.195
Boy.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.033
At least you're going to school, man.

15:56.163 --> 15:57.664
In the kitchen.

15:59.708 --> 16:03.169
Remember how Dad
used to always freak Mom out...

16:03.337 --> 16:04.963
...and tell her all those stories?

16:05.130 --> 16:06.589
Yeah, I remember.

16:06.757 --> 16:09.842
Like there was an owl
living in the attic.

16:10.678 --> 16:12.804
There was an owl up there.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.475
-Come on.
-What?

16:18.060 --> 16:20.561
-A real owl?
-A real owl.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.404
You think it's gone too?

16:35.744 --> 16:37.578
You got skills, man.

16:39.665 --> 16:41.082
Thanks.

16:46.588 --> 16:47.755
All right, listen up.

16:49.008 --> 16:50.925
One more thing.

16:54.596 --> 16:57.765
As I was getting the collections
together for Freddy's widow...

16:58.517 --> 17:00.226
...I found this.

17:01.937 --> 17:05.565
"For a good time, call 555-0125."

17:12.948 --> 17:15.992
You're sick, Baines. You need help.

17:16.868 --> 17:20.454
How you know it was me?
Did you call the number, chief?

17:23.375 --> 17:25.792
I can't believe you let your sister
marry this pig.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.920
She was always
bringing home strays.

17:28.088 --> 17:31.132
You know, maybe she's got a thing
for sick animals.

17:32.426 --> 17:35.970
-That's you, that's you.
-All right, settle down, settle down.

17:36.138 --> 17:37.972
Tomorrow begins the CCD cycle...

17:38.140 --> 17:41.309
...so if you can't be here on time,
be early.

17:43.520 --> 17:47.148
And I expect each of you
to pay extra special attention to detail.

17:47.316 --> 17:50.777
Half our ACTs will be carrying
HC priority loads.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.321
Yeah, I got his priority load.

17:55.616 --> 17:59.160
-Keep your eyes open out there.
-Open out there.

18:08.837 --> 18:11.923
-Hey, you got a second, Top?
-What is it, Hackett?

18:13.967 --> 18:17.220
Hey, I was wondering if you could
throw a few more shifts my way.

18:18.680 --> 18:22.975
Yeah, I know. I know it's a problem.
But I just need some help, man.

18:23.143 --> 18:26.187
Getting letters from the bank,
some real ugly letters.

18:27.022 --> 18:30.191
I'm sorry, kid.
Not enough to go around.

18:32.528 --> 18:34.612
All right. Thanks, Top.

18:52.756 --> 18:54.507
Eagle 12 to Control.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.385
We're code five and en route.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.638
Copy, Truck 12.
Next radio check-in in 15 minutes.

19:00.806 --> 19:02.515
Eagle 12, out.

19:06.145 --> 19:08.229
I think I know what happened
to that money.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.316
The Abilene job.

19:12.776 --> 19:15.278
They never caught those guys
because they don't exist.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.866
Crew hid the 4 million.

19:20.534 --> 19:23.870
And then they just made up that story
about getting jacked.

19:24.037 --> 19:27.248
Hide the money, fake being jacked.
That's classic.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.250
That's pretty good, huh?

19:29.418 --> 19:31.752
The only thing is,
they made one big mistake.

19:31.920 --> 19:33.087
What's that?

19:33.922 --> 19:36.215
They didn't take enough.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.640
This is the bank.

19:46.143 --> 19:47.768
What?

19:47.936 --> 19:50.479
It's trying to take the house.

20:03.952 --> 20:08.122
You know, the more things change,
the more they stay the same.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.876
-Shit, I don't know what that means.
-Well...

20:12.669 --> 20:17.006
...your dad worked two jobs,
barely made ends meet, right?

20:17.591 --> 20:21.302
And then, God bless them,
but he and your mother die...

20:21.470 --> 20:24.555
...and they leave you with
a house with two mortgages...

20:24.723 --> 20:26.974
...and a pile of hospital bills.

20:27.726 --> 20:30.061
That's not what they wanted for you.

20:30.479 --> 20:32.480
They wanted you to
get out of this place...

20:32.648 --> 20:35.316
...and have the life
that they never had.

20:35.651 --> 20:37.652
And now look at you.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.321
Here you are in the same old shit.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.702
Guys like your old man
used to bust their hump...

20:46.870 --> 20:49.205
...working in places like this.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.918
Then you go off to Iraq,
you serve your country...

20:54.253 --> 20:56.504
...and you earn a Silver Star.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.422
For what?

21:03.845 --> 21:06.013
Don't get me started.

21:08.976 --> 21:11.185
Come on, let's get something to eat.

21:15.440 --> 21:17.942
I'd get you another one,
but you usually stop at four.

21:18.110 --> 21:19.568
Thanks, Joe. Take another Coke.

21:19.736 --> 21:21.279
-You got it.
-Thanks.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.869
You really love them, don't you?

21:29.705 --> 21:33.207
My father used to take me
to ball games when I was a kid.

21:33.375 --> 21:35.459
We'd put away four of those things
apiece.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.045
-Every time I eat those, I'm--
-Any available unit...

21:38.213 --> 21:42.216
...we have reported gunshots in
the vicinity of Franklin and Durango.

21:42.384 --> 21:44.385
-Unit 8, show en route.
-Ten-four, 8.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.053
-Thanks, Joe.
-Get me next time.

21:46.221 --> 21:47.555
I'll get you this time.

21:48.265 --> 21:49.890
You be safe.

22:08.660 --> 22:12.163
This is one spot in the old 'hood
that's gonna be here forever.

22:13.582 --> 22:15.249
-Hey, Joe.
-What's up, Joe?

22:15.417 --> 22:18.336
Two regulars, one with cheese.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.088
-And get me another one to go.
-Another one to go.

22:21.256 --> 22:22.882
-For Jimmy.
-Thanks, man.

22:23.050 --> 22:24.925
How's he doing?

22:26.553 --> 22:28.721
Driving me crazy.

22:28.972 --> 22:31.390
-It's hard for him, you know?
-Yeah.

22:32.351 --> 22:34.018
I hear you.

22:39.399 --> 22:40.941
You know...

22:41.485 --> 22:44.528
...I really appreciate
everything you do, man.

22:45.614 --> 22:49.158
-What, are you kidding me?
-Well, you do a lot, man.

22:49.993 --> 22:51.869
You're like family to me, man.

22:52.037 --> 22:55.623
You and Jimmy.
You'll always be family to me.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.628
I'm really starting to feel it, Mike.

23:02.464 --> 23:05.216
The whole damn world, bro.

23:09.971 --> 23:12.431
Have you talked to Jimmy
about the situation?

23:12.599 --> 23:17.311
He knows the bank wants the house,
but he thinks I'll figure it out.

23:19.481 --> 23:22.316
-Good dog, Joe.
-Thanks.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.276
Listen.

23:25.445 --> 23:26.487
Let's take a walk.

23:26.655 --> 23:29.281
There's something I've been meaning
to talk to you about.

23:29.449 --> 23:31.951
-Thanks, Joe.
-All right. See you around.

23:35.914 --> 23:39.333
Tomorrow's the start
of a new CCD cycle.

23:40.335 --> 23:41.669
It only happens twice a year.

23:41.837 --> 23:45.756
Yeah, I heard this morning.
"Can't be on time, be early."

23:46.174 --> 23:47.425
Yeah.

23:47.592 --> 23:52.096
The banks will be looking
to crown their vault reserves...

23:52.681 --> 23:56.392
...which means we'll be transporting
something in the neighborhood of...

23:57.185 --> 23:58.936
...42 million.

23:59.104 --> 24:02.648
Damn. That's a lot of money.

24:03.024 --> 24:05.025
Damn straight.

24:05.569 --> 24:07.445
So....

24:08.697 --> 24:11.449
So think about it.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.119
Think we might get jacked?

24:15.287 --> 24:17.371
As a matter of fact, I do.

24:18.165 --> 24:20.666
We're gonna take that money, Ty.

24:20.834 --> 24:24.211
You, me, Baines, Quinn,
Palmer and Dobbs.

24:24.379 --> 24:25.379
What?

24:25.547 --> 24:27.965
It's gonna be just like
the Abilene job...

24:28.133 --> 24:31.385
...only we don't make
the same mistake they did.

24:31.553 --> 24:33.345
We're going big.

24:34.431 --> 24:36.056
Come on.

24:36.224 --> 24:39.018
What, you think last week
was a joke?

24:39.186 --> 24:40.895
It was a test run.

24:41.062 --> 24:44.565
Because that's exactly the way
this robbery's gonna play out.

24:44.858 --> 24:47.485
It's our alibi. We stash the money...

24:48.987 --> 24:50.988
...and we tell them we got jacked.

24:52.407 --> 24:55.868
You're planning to yank $42 million?

24:56.036 --> 24:59.538
No. We're planning
on yanking $42 million.

24:59.706 --> 25:01.248
Because I need you in this.

25:01.416 --> 25:04.585
-Are you crazy?
-It's gonna work. Think about it.

25:04.753 --> 25:08.255
-The cops are gonna be all over you.
-Forget the cops.

25:09.090 --> 25:11.342
Of course they'll be all over us
in the beginning.

25:11.510 --> 25:15.513
But we got a rock-solid alibi,
and all we gotta do is stick with it.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.973
-The trucks, Mike.
-We're gonna torch the trucks.

25:18.141 --> 25:20.267
-No evidence.
-"We're gonna torch the trucks"?

25:20.435 --> 25:22.770
-Are you listening to yourself?
-Ty, it's clean.

25:22.938 --> 25:24.438
It's clean.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.440
Come on, man.
There's no bad guys.

25:26.942 --> 25:29.902
Look, there's just us.
Nobody's gonna get hurt.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.237
Think about it.

25:31.404 --> 25:33.656
There's nothing to think about.
I'm not doing it.

25:33.823 --> 25:36.825
-All right.
-Me and Jimmy, we gonna be all right.

25:37.244 --> 25:40.496
Look, look, I understand.
You're a little bit worked up about this.

25:40.664 --> 25:44.959
I don't blame you.
It's a little last-minute, I understand.

25:46.962 --> 25:50.297
I want you to go home, sleep on it.

25:50.840 --> 25:54.760
And if you want in,
be at the bus stop in the morning.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.971
I won't be there.

25:57.138 --> 25:59.014
-All right. Where you going?
-I'm walking.

25:59.182 --> 26:01.850
-I'll drive you.
-I need the fresh air.

26:02.018 --> 26:04.353
Ty, come on.

26:04.604 --> 26:07.314
Promise me
you're gonna think about it.

26:07.482 --> 26:09.358
Ty!

26:12.862 --> 26:14.863
Come on, man.

26:15.282 --> 26:16.907
Look.

26:18.868 --> 26:23.998
All right,
I know I can trust you with this.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.030
Ty.

27:38.198 --> 27:41.241
This lady came here to see you.
She's from Child Welfare.

27:41.409 --> 27:43.035
Sir, are you Mr. Tyler Hackett?

27:43.203 --> 27:45.746
-Child Welfare, Ty.
-Yeah, yeah, wait, wait, wait.

27:45.914 --> 27:49.792
-What's going on? What's going on?
-Kept telling her we ain't on welfare...

27:49.959 --> 27:51.418
...but she didn't wanna listen.

27:51.586 --> 27:54.755
And I've tried to explain
it's not that kind of welfare.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.758
-Child Supervision and Services.
-Whatever, lady. Whatever.

27:57.926 --> 28:00.511
My brother got a job, okay?
We don't need no welfare.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.596
Jimmy, shut up!

28:04.724 --> 28:06.600
Okay?

28:08.436 --> 28:09.436
Come in.

28:09.604 --> 28:10.771
In the past 10 months...

28:10.939 --> 28:13.816
...during the little time
he's actually appeared at school...

28:13.983 --> 28:17.444
...James has had two suspensions,
four arrests.

28:17.612 --> 28:20.781
For tagging. He's artsy.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.536
Look at that. Tell me that's not art.

28:29.749 --> 28:32.668
Okay. Come on, lady.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.754
He's a good kid.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.966
When I was his age,
I was hot-wiring cars.

28:40.635 --> 28:42.136
Okay.

28:42.303 --> 28:43.762
That came out wrong.

28:43.930 --> 28:45.764
Your brother's school
has notified us...

28:45.932 --> 28:49.393
...he's missed more days
than he's attended this year.

28:49.894 --> 28:52.354
What's she talking about, Jimmy?

28:53.022 --> 28:55.441
I asked you a question, boy.

28:58.653 --> 29:01.447
I was looking for a job
so we could keep the house.

29:01.614 --> 29:04.783
-You're losing your house?
-No, we're not losing the house.

29:04.951 --> 29:07.995
You have to understand, if James
doesn't have the proper lodging--

29:08.163 --> 29:10.247
I didn't know he was missing school.

29:11.166 --> 29:13.834
As a result,
the Department of Child Welfare...

29:14.002 --> 29:16.754
...is legally obligated
to intervene on James' behalf...

29:16.921 --> 29:20.007
...to determine if he's a candidate
for state-funded care.

29:21.342 --> 29:22.509
Foster care.

29:23.970 --> 29:26.889
No, foster care,
that must be a mistake.

29:27.056 --> 29:29.767
I'm Jimmy's legal guardian.
I take care of him.

29:31.561 --> 29:33.687
Okay, all right.

29:34.606 --> 29:36.190
I admit it's been tough.

29:37.442 --> 29:41.987
He lost both--
We lost both our parents this year.

29:43.198 --> 29:47.159
-I understand, Mr. Hackett--
-Nobody's splitting us up, lady.

29:48.411 --> 29:51.663
He's my brother.
You know what that means, huh?

29:51.831 --> 29:55.542
I'm all he's got. He's all I got.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.757
Nobody's splitting us up.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.384
Period.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.818
No one gets hurt, right?

31:46.863 --> 31:48.405
How?

31:48.990 --> 31:51.033
There's no bad guys.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.784
Only good guys.

31:56.664 --> 31:58.665
Jimmy needs me.

31:58.833 --> 32:01.960
I cannot go to jail.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.130
You hear me?

32:06.633 --> 32:08.842
No more blood on my hands.

32:12.513 --> 32:14.848
Promise me nobody gets hurt.

32:15.892 --> 32:18.852
Nobody gets hurt. That's a promise.

33:01.646 --> 33:02.896
Hackett, hold up a minute.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.405
Came in today.

33:11.739 --> 33:15.242
It's official, kid.
Now you've got the tin to prove it.

33:15.743 --> 33:19.579
I want you to know it's an honor having
a decorated veteran on my crew.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.501
I mean that.

33:24.669 --> 33:26.712
Come on, let's roll out.

34:32.445 --> 34:34.071
Gentlemen.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.462
-Courtesy transport 3489.
-Copy that.

35:35.716 --> 35:38.176
-Reserves, Federal Reserve Bank.
-It's fine.

35:54.193 --> 35:57.028
-Yeah, that's right, that's right.
-We all done? All right.

35:57.196 --> 35:58.738
All right, gentlemen.

36:01.075 --> 36:02.075
All right.

36:02.243 --> 36:04.452
-We're all good.
-Let's roll out.

36:50.291 --> 36:52.375
It's time to check in.

36:59.258 --> 37:01.092
Eagle 12, Control.

37:02.345 --> 37:04.095
Go ahead, 12.

37:04.472 --> 37:06.598
Twelve is--

37:09.435 --> 37:16.650
Code five.

37:17.318 --> 37:21.363
Situation normal. We're on Jefferson
headed back to the barn.

37:21.989 --> 37:23.823
Copy, 12.

37:24.784 --> 37:27.827
Next check-in in 58 minutes.

37:28.746 --> 37:31.831
Copy that. Eagle 12, out.

39:38.959 --> 39:41.378
-That's beautiful.
-See what I mean?

39:41.545 --> 39:43.755
-You smell that?
-Yes. The smell of freedom.

39:43.923 --> 39:46.007
No. Smells like ours.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.968
Baines, stop that. You want the cops
smelling booze on you?

39:49.136 --> 39:51.638
-Come on, put it away. Put it away.
-Okay, okay, okay.

39:51.806 --> 39:53.848
All right, look, we got 51 minutes...

39:54.016 --> 39:56.976
...to stash this money and then
get jacked. Let's go. Come on.

39:57.311 --> 39:58.770
Come on.

39:58.938 --> 40:02.982
Take that gear off. I got a job for you.
Let's go. Let's go.

40:05.361 --> 40:06.820
Now is not the time to pray.

40:08.531 --> 40:10.949
-Come on, Hackett.
-All right, keep it moving.

40:11.117 --> 40:13.660
Come on, come on, come on.
Keep it moving.

40:13.828 --> 40:14.869
That's it.

40:15.037 --> 40:18.206
Put the money in these bags.
Put them in the hole, all right?

40:18.374 --> 40:20.917
Keep it moving. Let's go.

40:21.085 --> 40:23.837
Come on, guys.
Let's move, let's move.

40:24.004 --> 40:25.171
All right, let's go.

40:25.339 --> 40:28.258
-Keep it coming. Come on.
-All this money.

40:30.928 --> 40:33.346
Yeah, yeah. Come on.

40:36.434 --> 40:37.767
Here it comes, here it comes.

40:37.935 --> 40:40.019
-Come on, come on.
-All right, keep it coming.

40:51.073 --> 40:54.868
-That's it. This one's empty.
-All right.

40:55.035 --> 40:57.120
Last one, let's go.

41:06.172 --> 41:07.380
Someone's here.

41:46.962 --> 41:48.630
Easy, Grandpa.

41:50.257 --> 41:52.050
Easy.

42:01.310 --> 42:03.269
Mike. Mike. Mike.

42:06.357 --> 42:09.108
Wait, wait. Wait one sec.
Let's just put the money back.

42:09.276 --> 42:10.777
-I don't like this, Mike.
-Shit!

42:10.945 --> 42:12.529
Everybody, okay, let's stay calm.

42:12.696 --> 42:14.822
-He saw our faces, man!
-We let him go!

42:14.990 --> 42:16.908
He saw our freaking faces, man!

42:21.956 --> 42:23.831
-Shit.
-Are you out of your mind?

42:30.798 --> 42:33.550
Hey, calm down!
Calm down right now!

42:34.552 --> 42:37.053
-Jesus Christ!
-Are you all right?

42:38.264 --> 42:40.974
-Come on, chief. You wanna go?
-Just calm down.

42:41.517 --> 42:42.976
Let him go.

42:43.143 --> 42:44.310
-Let him go.
-You're crazy.

42:44.478 --> 42:46.771
-Come on! Come on, chief!
-Ty, where you going?

42:47.523 --> 42:49.983
Ty, he's not gonna make it.

42:50.442 --> 42:51.776
Ty, stop!

43:06.875 --> 43:08.126
I had to do it.

43:11.171 --> 43:12.672
I had no choice.

43:16.677 --> 43:18.177
I do.

43:18.846 --> 43:20.221
No, you don't.

43:21.015 --> 43:22.473
Mike.

43:32.151 --> 43:33.192
Come on, Ty.

43:34.111 --> 43:35.695
Open up.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.363
We gotta figure this thing out.

43:37.531 --> 43:40.408
You just shot that--
You just killed that man.

43:40.576 --> 43:42.869
He was gonna die
before you got him to a hospital.

43:43.037 --> 43:46.748
-You don't know that. You don't!
-Yes, I do, and so do you.

43:46.915 --> 43:50.418
Look. Ty, he was gonna
land us in jail anyway.

43:50.586 --> 43:52.503
Don't you understand?

43:52.713 --> 43:57.050
Ty, open this door so we can figure
this thing out together like a team.

43:57.217 --> 44:00.428
You just want me to walk out there,
huh?

44:00.596 --> 44:02.096
Baines just tried to kill me!

44:02.264 --> 44:04.474
Forget Baines.
I'll deal with Baines, I promise.

44:04.642 --> 44:08.269
-Your promises don't mean shit.
-Look, I admit Baines screwed up.

44:08.729 --> 44:11.230
You're absolutely right about that.

44:11.523 --> 44:14.567
But I didn't want us
to all go down for his mistake.

44:16.236 --> 44:17.612
We gotta clean this up.

44:17.780 --> 44:21.574
If we keep our cool,
this thing could still work.

44:24.286 --> 44:26.204
Think about Jimmy.

44:26.747 --> 44:28.748
He needs you.

44:31.627 --> 44:33.211
Control?

44:34.922 --> 44:37.465
Control, Eagle 12, this is Eagle....

44:39.885 --> 44:42.762
Come on, Ty. Come on,
we can still make this work.

44:43.305 --> 44:45.765
Open the door.

44:46.100 --> 44:48.226
Open this door!

47:20.587 --> 47:23.297
-Hear that, Joe?
-Hear what?

47:33.600 --> 47:35.434
Pop the hood.

47:44.903 --> 47:47.572
Get out of the truck. Come on.

47:56.456 --> 47:58.374
-We're dead, man.
-No, it's gonna be okay.

47:58.542 --> 48:01.627
-Just be cool. We stick to the plan.
-Stick to the plan?

48:01.795 --> 48:04.297
-Shooting that guy part of the plan?
-Stop whining.

48:06.925 --> 48:08.593
Maybe he's right, we should leave.

48:08.760 --> 48:10.261
-And go where?
-I don't know.

48:10.429 --> 48:13.556
You guys can sit here and you can
wait for the cops. I am done.

48:13.724 --> 48:16.767
-You're not going anywhere.
-Dobbs is right.

48:18.061 --> 48:21.314
In 40 minutes, when we fail
to check in with Ashcroft...

48:21.481 --> 48:24.150
...this whole area
is gonna be crawling with cops.

48:27.821 --> 48:31.115
Here's what we can do. We can
forget about the money in my truck...

48:31.658 --> 48:35.244
...and take the 21 mil from
Quinn's truck and split it up five ways.

48:35.412 --> 48:36.621
Still a lot of money.

48:36.788 --> 48:40.041
It's a lot of money. But then what?

48:40.459 --> 48:42.793
Cat's out of the bag now.

48:44.046 --> 48:45.922
This changes everything.

48:46.089 --> 48:49.300
-Well, what do we do?
-Yeah, what do you wanna do, Mike?

48:53.096 --> 48:55.723
We get the kid out of the truck.

48:55.891 --> 48:57.350
How?

48:57.601 --> 49:00.102
-The hinges.
-Hinges?

49:00.729 --> 49:03.522
Those hinges are tempered steel.

49:03.690 --> 49:04.941
Yeah, but the pins aren't.

49:05.108 --> 49:09.737
If we can drive the pins through,
the hinges will come undone.

49:10.030 --> 49:12.156
We got less than 40 minutes
to do this.

49:12.366 --> 49:14.951
-And then what?
-And then...

49:16.036 --> 49:18.204
...when the cops arrive...

49:18.789 --> 49:22.667
...we tell them that Ty died
saving our lives.

49:24.336 --> 49:26.545
-That he died a hero.
-That'll work.

49:29.883 --> 49:31.676
All you had to do was open the door.

49:35.305 --> 49:39.100
Come on, let's get something
to open this goddamn hinge.

49:47.401 --> 49:49.735
I would've protected you.

50:29.568 --> 50:31.193
Jesus!

50:32.738 --> 50:34.864
All right, well, let's go.
We got 36 minutes.

50:56.970 --> 50:58.637
Eagle 24, what's your 10-20?

50:58.805 --> 51:02.975
Request for 500,000 CTO
from WLH Trust.

51:05.645 --> 51:09.356
-Hold for 12 and 17.
-You got it, boss.

51:09.524 --> 51:11.484
They're due in 30.

51:19.493 --> 51:21.619
-Come on, give it to me.
-Okay.

51:21.787 --> 51:23.829
All right, you and me. Let's go.

51:52.025 --> 51:54.819
Mike.
Come on, this is taking too long.

51:55.737 --> 51:58.823
-You got a better idea?
-Keep going.

52:09.543 --> 52:14.839
Dobbs.

52:26.810 --> 52:28.394
What?

52:28.603 --> 52:30.563
Help me, man.

52:32.315 --> 52:34.233
I can't.

52:34.526 --> 52:38.696
-You should've stuck with us.
-Come on, Dobbs.

52:40.532 --> 52:41.991
We're not murderers.

53:01.928 --> 53:05.431
Just help me out, man.
You gotta help me out.

53:07.434 --> 53:09.059
No.

53:09.477 --> 53:11.437
No, I don't.

53:21.615 --> 53:23.490
-Gonna come out now?
-What are you doing?

53:23.658 --> 53:25.534
What's it look like I'm doing?

53:26.995 --> 53:29.079
Hey, come on, Baines.

53:30.457 --> 53:31.999
Are you out of your mind?

53:33.376 --> 53:35.085
You want some?

53:35.253 --> 53:36.795
Come on.

53:37.547 --> 53:38.714
Hey!

53:38.882 --> 53:40.132
Hey! Hey!

53:40.300 --> 53:42.092
Let him go! Come on!

53:44.971 --> 53:46.305
Come on!

53:46.473 --> 53:49.225
Come on! Come on! Come on!

53:52.062 --> 53:55.481
Goddamn it! You broke my tooth,
you damn moron.

53:56.066 --> 53:57.524
Next time I'll break your head.

53:57.692 --> 54:00.236
You burn the truck,
you burn the money, you idiot.

54:00.403 --> 54:03.072
I'm gonna tell your sister
you called me that.

54:28.890 --> 54:31.225
Unit 8 to Dispatch.

54:35.063 --> 54:36.689
Dispatch.

55:03.967 --> 55:05.592
Sorry.

55:06.636 --> 55:08.804
Okay, keep going.

55:24.904 --> 55:27.656
Cops! There's a cop car coming.

55:49.346 --> 55:51.430
-He stopped.
-I can take care of it.

55:51.598 --> 55:54.933
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
No, he's not here for us.

55:55.101 --> 55:58.437
Don't do anything stupid.
I'm gonna get rid of him.

55:59.856 --> 56:01.440
-Hey there.
-Hey!

56:01.608 --> 56:05.361
Hey. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy.

56:05.570 --> 56:07.279
Is everything okay?

56:07.447 --> 56:11.408
-What are you doing here?
-I'm a security guard. Yeah.

56:11.576 --> 56:14.828
Yeah, I also do
some maintenance work as well.

56:14.996 --> 56:17.748
Yeah. Is everything okay?

56:19.125 --> 56:20.876
I thought I heard a siren.

56:21.961 --> 56:26.465
Siren? No, no sirens here.
At least to the best of my knowledge.

56:26.800 --> 56:29.385
What do they need security
at an abandoned building for?

56:29.844 --> 56:32.054
Well, it's for insurance purposes.

56:32.222 --> 56:34.098
They've got vagrants
running around here.

56:34.349 --> 56:38.143
They're stealing copper
and just stripping the place clean.

56:38.645 --> 56:40.729
It's really terrible.

56:41.272 --> 56:43.399
I heard some banging too.

56:44.484 --> 56:46.068
Where?

56:46.403 --> 56:48.404
Couldn't tell you where from.

56:53.618 --> 56:55.994
I've had to chase them
out of here numerous times.

56:56.162 --> 56:59.832
They're mostly bums, but if one of
them gets hurt, the owner's still liable.

57:00.542 --> 57:03.419
-Everybody wants a piece of the pie.
-Yeah.

57:04.838 --> 57:06.338
So...

57:06.506 --> 57:09.925
...there's nothing over here
in this particular unit.

57:10.093 --> 57:11.969
Sounded like it was coming
from in there.

57:12.137 --> 57:16.306
Yeah, I just came from in there
and I didn't see anything.

57:16.474 --> 57:19.017
Of course, I don't like
going in there much, you know.

57:19.185 --> 57:22.688
I can show you around,
but you might wanna cover your nose.

57:22.856 --> 57:24.273
Why's that?

57:24.441 --> 57:26.316
An old dog crawled in there
and died.

57:30.822 --> 57:34.533
The rats have eaten most of him. The
stench is so bad, it'll make you puke.

57:34.701 --> 57:38.996
They've got these rats,
they're the size of a big old fat cat.

57:39.539 --> 57:41.373
Come on in, I'll show you the dog.

57:41.541 --> 57:43.542
-I'll take your word for it.
-You sure?

57:43.710 --> 57:45.085
Yeah.

57:48.047 --> 57:50.048
Well, thanks for stopping by.

57:50.216 --> 57:52.718
If I hear anything,
I'll be sure to let you know.

58:13.615 --> 58:16.033
Come on. Help me get him inside.

58:26.920 --> 58:29.421
-Should've never trusted you.
-He was coming inside!

58:29.589 --> 58:30.923
He heard the siren!

58:31.090 --> 58:33.675
-What was I supposed to do?
-Damn it.

58:36.137 --> 58:37.262
What the hell was that?

58:37.430 --> 58:40.390
I didn't know what else to do!
What else did you want me to do?

58:40.558 --> 58:42.476
He was coming inside! Damn it!

58:42.644 --> 58:44.228
Come on.

58:46.147 --> 58:48.398
No, no, no!

58:51.903 --> 58:53.612
What the hell is wrong with you?

58:53.780 --> 58:56.323
Well, what was I supposed to do?
He was coming inside!

58:56.950 --> 58:58.367
He was coming inside!

59:00.453 --> 59:02.412
Oh, shit.

59:13.466 --> 59:15.717
Don't look at me like that.

59:15.885 --> 59:18.345
-What did you want me to do?
-You did this, man.

59:18.513 --> 59:21.265
-Yeah, yeah, he's alive.
-Move your head!

59:22.684 --> 59:24.643
-What's going on?
-I don't know.

59:30.858 --> 59:32.359
Fuck!

59:33.903 --> 59:35.028
No!

59:35.196 --> 59:37.656
No, no, no.

59:41.244 --> 59:44.079
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no.

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:05.100
Okay, okay, okay, hang on.

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.019
God. What's happening to me?

01:00:07.186 --> 01:00:09.688
You're just going into shock.
Okay? All right.

01:00:12.358 --> 01:00:15.193
-I need you to stay with me.
-What's happening to me?

01:00:32.712 --> 01:00:34.254
Okay, okay, all right.

01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:36.256
Just look at me, look at me,
look at me.

01:00:36.424 --> 01:00:38.967
Okay, I need you to breathe.
Breathe, breathe.

01:00:39.385 --> 01:00:41.720
There we go. Slow and steady.
That's better.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:45.432
I'm gonna have to clean this up
and stop the bleeding. All right? Okay.

01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:48.268
Fuck!

01:00:57.403 --> 01:00:59.112
All right.

01:00:59.405 --> 01:01:00.405
I got an idea.

01:01:00.573 --> 01:01:03.241
Pressure, pressure, pressure.
Keep pressure on the wound.

01:01:03.409 --> 01:01:06.912
Can you do that, huh?
Can you hear me? All right. All right.

01:01:07.246 --> 01:01:09.831
Okay, I'm gonna call--
I'm gonna call in and report you.

01:01:10.249 --> 01:01:13.835
Officer down. Officer down.

01:01:21.052 --> 01:01:23.595
Okay, all right.
We just stop the bleeding...

01:01:23.763 --> 01:01:26.431
...we can wait this out.
Me and you. Okay?

01:01:26.599 --> 01:01:28.850
You're not dying today. Okay.

01:01:39.112 --> 01:01:40.445
What's your name, man?

01:01:41.406 --> 01:01:43.615
Eckehart. Jake Eckehart.

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:45.992
Jake.
How long until your backup comes?

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:47.619
I don't know, an hour maybe.

01:01:47.787 --> 01:01:50.372
There was a glitch.
I'm bleeding again, man.

01:01:50.540 --> 01:01:53.208
I know, I know. Keep pressure on it,
keep pressure on it.

01:01:53.376 --> 01:01:55.043
-Okay? All right?
-Okay.

01:01:55.211 --> 01:01:56.461
You gotta breathe, though.

01:01:56.921 --> 01:02:00.716
Breathe. The more you breathe,
the less it hurts.

01:02:18.651 --> 01:02:20.527
Come on, Palmer.

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.613
You watch my hand.

01:03:31.098 --> 01:03:41.775
Ty?

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:44.444
Are you home?

01:03:48.115 --> 01:03:53.537
Ty?

01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:12.055
Is he still alive?

01:04:12.223 --> 01:04:15.600
He's not gonna be
if we don't get help soon.

01:04:16.727 --> 01:04:18.645
Okay, listen to me.

01:04:18.855 --> 01:04:21.857
Cochrane pulled the main fuse
from the engine.

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:23.483
It's in his coat pocket.

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:27.028
-I'm scared, Ty.
-Dobbs.

01:04:27.655 --> 01:04:29.030
I need you to get it.

01:04:29.949 --> 01:04:32.367
It's our only way out of here.

01:04:34.078 --> 01:04:36.037
Get it, Dobbs.

01:04:36.622 --> 01:04:38.331
Get it.

01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:50.969
He's doing it.

01:04:52.179 --> 01:04:56.474
He's doing it.
Nice. Nice and easy now.

01:05:58.621 --> 01:06:01.039
I don't know what we're doing here...

01:06:01.666 --> 01:06:04.668
-...anymore, man.
-I know.

01:06:05.670 --> 01:06:08.838
This is not what we agreed to,
Mike. I mean....

01:06:11.050 --> 01:06:12.717
Palmer.

01:06:12.885 --> 01:06:15.971
Don't let them do anything to me,
man, please?

01:06:19.392 --> 01:06:21.101
I won't.

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:27.983
Okay.

01:06:28.901 --> 01:06:31.903
Okay. All right, man.

01:06:55.845 --> 01:06:56.928
I'm sorry, man.

01:06:57.096 --> 01:06:58.263
-It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:00.348
-It's okay.
-I can't do it.

01:07:00.516 --> 01:07:02.600
-I know, I know. I know.
-I can't do it.

01:07:02.768 --> 01:07:04.644
I just wanna go home.

01:07:04.812 --> 01:07:08.273
I wanna go home, man.
I wanna see my kid and....

01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:12.861
-It's gonna be okay.
-I'm sorry, man. I'm really sorry.

01:07:37.595 --> 01:07:39.971
No one was supposed to get hurt.

01:07:42.308 --> 01:07:43.892
I'm gonna bleed to death.

01:08:10.211 --> 01:08:12.670
-I need your radio.
-It's right here.

01:08:14.548 --> 01:08:16.758
-What are you doing?
-I'm getting us some cover.

01:08:26.018 --> 01:08:27.769
Hey, Palmer.

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:33.691
Palmer. Hold up.

01:08:36.987 --> 01:08:39.531
Palmer? You with us?

01:08:39.698 --> 01:08:42.200
Let's go. Get back to work.

01:08:55.256 --> 01:08:56.296
What are you doing?

01:08:56.465 --> 01:09:00.593
They can't see us, they don't know
what we're doing. Right?

01:09:03.764 --> 01:09:05.682
-You with me? You with me?
-Yeah.

01:09:05.850 --> 01:09:08.393
-All right. Hang tight, hang tight.
-Yeah.

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:35.170
Hurry up.

01:09:35.754 --> 01:09:38.923
Keep talking. Keep breathing.

01:09:40.593 --> 01:09:43.511
-Talk to me, talk to me.
-I'm fine. I'm all right.

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:08.995
Yeah. Yeah.

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:36.231
Okay. I'm going up to the roof.
I'm gonna try to get a signal.

01:10:36.398 --> 01:10:39.025
Okay? You just keep pressure
on that thing. I'll be back.

01:10:39.193 --> 01:10:40.610
Why would you come back?

01:10:42.738 --> 01:10:45.490
Because I'm the reason
you're in this mess, Jake.

01:10:46.951 --> 01:10:49.661
-Just stay put.
-Yeah.

01:12:40.981 --> 01:12:42.523
Come on.

01:12:53.660 --> 01:12:56.871
-I think I heard something.
-What?

01:12:58.457 --> 01:12:59.957
Palmer.

01:13:00.125 --> 01:13:02.126
Go check it out.

01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:15.264
Let's go.

01:13:43.627 --> 01:13:47.004
-Come on.
-Unit 8, what's your 20?

01:13:47.172 --> 01:13:49.841
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we have--
We have an officer down.

01:13:50.008 --> 01:13:52.552
We have an officer down.
I need help.

01:13:52.719 --> 01:13:54.762
What is your location?

01:13:56.181 --> 01:13:59.517
We're at the Steele--
Steele Industry Center.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:02.186
-State your name, please.
-Just--

01:14:02.354 --> 01:14:04.230
Just get here, please.

01:14:04.398 --> 01:14:06.774
Units en route, code three.

01:14:11.530 --> 01:14:13.114
It's done.

01:14:15.492 --> 01:14:17.160
It's over.

01:14:17.744 --> 01:14:19.579
You stupid kid.

01:14:19.746 --> 01:14:22.039
Just put the gun down.

01:14:22.583 --> 01:14:23.708
Okay?

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:28.921
Don't make it-- Don't make it worse.
Just put the gun down.

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:31.799
Why couldn't you just go along?

01:14:32.885 --> 01:14:35.094
Palmer, listen to me, just....

01:14:35.512 --> 01:14:37.388
Just put the gun down.

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:39.682
Okay, okay.

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:41.851
-You didn't hurt anybody.
-Shut up!

01:14:42.019 --> 01:14:43.644
Shut your fucking mouth!

01:14:44.396 --> 01:14:46.063
Okay.

01:14:47.065 --> 01:14:49.650
You don't know a thing.

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:55.740
You don't want--
You don't wanna do this.

01:14:57.034 --> 01:14:58.659
You don't wanna do this.

01:15:00.496 --> 01:15:01.537
Just put the gun--

01:15:01.705 --> 01:15:04.207
Just put the gun down
and we both go home.

01:15:04.374 --> 01:15:08.252
-We could go home. It's a bad day.
-Shut up! Shut up!

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:10.922
Shut the hell up!

01:15:25.395 --> 01:15:27.939
You think God will forgive me?

01:16:18.907 --> 01:16:21.617
No, you can't go to sleep.
You can't go to sleep.

01:16:21.785 --> 01:16:24.579
Jake, you can't go to sleep.

01:16:25.706 --> 01:16:28.165
They're coming. I got through.
I got through.

01:16:57.654 --> 01:17:00.031
Jimmy. Don't you touch him!

01:17:01.450 --> 01:17:02.575
Get out of the truck.

01:17:21.637 --> 01:17:24.055
I'm not messing around.

01:17:24.389 --> 01:17:26.724
Get out of the truck.

01:17:28.101 --> 01:17:29.727
Ty.

01:17:30.145 --> 01:17:32.980
-You got three seconds, Ty.
-Ty, help me.

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:34.565
Come on, soldier boy.

01:17:34.733 --> 01:17:38.069
One, two....

01:18:05.889 --> 01:18:08.599
Ty? Ty? Ty?

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:28.619
All right.
Are you okay? Are you okay?

01:18:28.787 --> 01:18:30.913
Are you okay?

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:40.464
Come on, Jimmy, let's move!

01:18:40.632 --> 01:18:42.174
Move!

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:50.474
You okay? You hurt?

01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:55.479
Okay, I'm gonna make sure the cops
know how to find us. I'll be back.

01:18:55.647 --> 01:18:59.859
-No, no, no, Ty.
-Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy.

01:19:01.319 --> 01:19:02.987
I'll be back.

01:19:05.031 --> 01:19:06.657
All right?

01:22:21.519 --> 01:22:23.812
Cop told us what you did.

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:33.781
There's talk of a reward.

01:22:43.541 --> 01:22:44.875
Hey.

01:22:46.544 --> 01:22:48.504
We going home?

01:22:53.593 --> 01:22:54.635
Yeah.
