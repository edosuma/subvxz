01:32.448 --> 01:35.154
<I>Daddy!

04:48.356 --> 04:52.545
<I>Hey, little girl! Come on out!

04:53.246 --> 04:55.712
<I>I'm not gonna hurt you!

04:57.053 --> 05:00.751
<I>Where're you at? You don't wanna be
out in the wilderness all alone?

05:01.825 --> 05:06.335
<I>I'll take you to your dad.
You want to see your dad, don't you?

05:42.748 --> 05:43.820
<I>Daddy!

06:34.875 --> 06:37.444
- Bart?
- I'll get this one!

06:37.923 --> 06:39.688
You just make sure you kill that girl!

06:40.444 --> 06:43.180
<I>Oh, I'll get her. You just make sure
you get him!

07:20.807 --> 07:22.933
Sorry, little lady.

07:24.650 --> 07:26.606
We can't have any witnesses.

07:27.167 --> 07:31.685
- Daddy, please help me.
- You just close your eyes.

07:40.256 --> 07:42.495
Turn around, Leia!

07:56.926 --> 07:58.159
Put the gun down!

08:00.869 --> 08:03.589
You know what happens when you
shoot an unarmed man in these parts?

08:05.931 --> 08:08.225
- Do your job, Sheriff!
- Shut up!

08:08.788 --> 08:13.076
- Damn it, listen to me.
- I am innocent man!

08:15.079 --> 08:17.741
Is this one of the cowboys
who killed your wife?

08:18.311 --> 08:19.270
Last one.

08:21.975 --> 08:23.968
Okay, glad you've found 'em.

08:25.318 --> 08:27.693
Now let me take him as my prisoner
and you as my witness.

08:28.696 --> 08:32.039
Put the gun down, Chamberlain.
Put the gun down.

08:32.715 --> 08:35.772
You can help me bring him to justice
in accord to law.

08:41.375 --> 08:44.473
Good man, Chamberlain.
Now let him go.

08:48.448 --> 08:51.117
Unless I get Donnison,
I will not let you go.

08:51.296 --> 08:52.632
No, you won't.

08:54.624 --> 08:56.103
You'll hang for this.

10:26.005 --> 10:27.391
How delightfully rustic.

10:27.859 --> 10:31.419
I haven't seen a place this filthy
since Calcutta in '54.

10:31.693 --> 10:34.888
- Agreed, sir.
- Ah, but that's all part of the charm,

10:34.908 --> 10:36.929
part of the adventure.

10:45.699 --> 10:49.664
Oh good. It looks as somebody's
noticed my money.

10:58.354 --> 11:02.274
May I introduce you to
Baron Charles Emerson of Yorkshire.

11:04.214 --> 11:08.581
Good day it is, sir.
May I welcome you to Franklin County.

11:08.761 --> 11:12.372
We have all the hospitality and comfort
you could want.

11:12.554 --> 11:15.567
I'm Mayor Cotswell
and I am at your service.

11:15.766 --> 11:20.168
- It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Oh, the pleasure is all mine, good sir.

11:20.188 --> 11:25.273
- Now, if I may, you mentioned a hospitality?
- Oh yes, we have a hotel,

11:25.353 --> 11:27.823
a saloon and a brothel.

11:28.555 --> 11:31.364
With just about the sweetest ladies
you ever did see.

11:31.609 --> 11:34.964
How very inviting.
And what of the war?

11:35.302 --> 11:38.526
Oh, the war don't come close to us.
You have nothing to fear.

11:38.728 --> 11:42.511
Oh, I am not afraid of the war,
I have seen all of it.

11:42.915 --> 11:44.809
But first things first, dear Mayor.

11:45.221 --> 11:49.140
I hope you don't mind my saying,
but I am wildly attracted by your topper.

11:51.924 --> 11:54.192
- My hat?
- Indeed.

11:54.212 --> 11:58.494
And if I am due acclimate to your culture,
'blend in', so to speak...

11:58.805 --> 12:01.086
um, I'm going to need it.

12:05.679 --> 12:09.923
Hm. Well, I'll be honest with you, sir.

12:10.384 --> 12:15.038
Baron. With this much money,
you could buy ten hats.

12:15.221 --> 12:17.906
We've a general store in town
that sells 'em.

12:18.807 --> 12:22.404
Well, I don't need ten hats.
I need but one.

12:22.773 --> 12:25.702
This one, in particular.

12:29.835 --> 12:31.396
My pleasure.

12:32.388 --> 12:34.805
Hey, is there anything else
we can do for you?

12:35.162 --> 12:40.664
Well. yes, I read in the newspapers recently
that your Sheriff apprehended a <i>desperado</i>.

12:40.932 --> 12:45.411
Oooh yes, we are mighty proud of our sheriff
for apprehending that [monstrosity].

12:45.997 --> 12:49.556
We are hanging that murderous
Chamberlain character tomorrow.

12:50.029 --> 12:52.342
I can get you a seat at the hanging,
if you like.

12:52.605 --> 12:56.407
Ahh, simple entertainment
for good simple people.

12:57.302 --> 13:01.299
Mr. Chamberlain claims he murdered
those men in self-defense.

13:01.804 --> 13:03.978
Now, we got no proof of that, of course.

13:04.298 --> 13:06.947
Those men were slaughtered in cold blood.

13:07.627 --> 13:09.886
Highly suspect, if you ask me.

13:10.599 --> 13:13.506
Now I know why they call this
The Wild West.

13:13.786 --> 13:16.446
Well, the West has been known for it's outlaws,

13:16.526 --> 13:19.282
but we're bringing this to an end
here in Franklin county.

13:20.526 --> 13:23.371
We're gonna make an example
with this Mr. Chamberlain.

13:24.260 --> 13:28.420
I am sure that there are truer words that have
never been spoken, dear Mayor.

13:28.682 --> 13:34.175
- Now, about that brothel?
- Well, right this way.

13:34.699 --> 13:38.305
Your Chinaman will have to stay out
back in the alley, of course.

13:39.941 --> 13:41.393
Bet you.

14:14.484 --> 14:15.514
Hi, baby.

14:16.074 --> 14:18.488
I'm here to serve notice
to you, Mr. Chamberlain.

14:18.704 --> 14:22.596
According to the laws of this state,
it is you stand convicted of murder

14:22.616 --> 14:25.773
your daughter is to be placed
in the custody of the Mission Orphanage.

14:25.793 --> 14:28.456
No. No, you - you can't
take my daughter, please.

14:29.112 --> 14:32.092
You get to be hanged tomorrow, Mr. Chamberlain.

14:32.112 --> 14:35.920
At least you got a fair trial,
unlike the men you murdered.

14:37.870 --> 14:40.060
Those men killed my wife and were going
to kill my daughter,

14:40.080 --> 14:41.730
if I did not get to them first.

14:43.210 --> 14:47.927
The sheriff didn't believe you, the jury didn't
believe you and the judge didn't believe you.

14:48.438 --> 14:50.692
And even if I did, it wouldn't
make any difference.

14:51.350 --> 14:54.054
My job is to serve notice, I've done that.

14:55.451 --> 15:00.243
- Say goodbye to your father, child.
- Daddy, don't let her take me.

15:01.224 --> 15:06.494
When Mommy went to heaven, you
promised me that we would always be together.

15:08.648 --> 15:11.475
- It's time to go.
- No, wait. Wait!

15:11.917 --> 15:14.701
Prolonging this is pointless.

15:21.980 --> 15:27.173
- Daddy, don't leave me.
- You gonna be okay, baby. I promise.

15:27.530 --> 15:29.074
I love you so much.

15:30.156 --> 15:32.156
Okay now. Come along.

16:10.944 --> 16:15.347
- Good day, sir.
- I present Baron Charles Emerson of Yorkshire.

16:15.544 --> 16:18.431
Always a pleasure to meet a law man.

16:18.611 --> 16:20.508
Can I help you folks with something?

16:21.593 --> 16:25.422
Of all the places I've been, this Wild West
of yours intrigues me the most.

16:25.742 --> 16:28.820
You have everything, from gunslingers
to grizzly bears.

16:29.421 --> 16:33.895
You have the noble savage Indian,
you have a virgin frontier.

16:34.090 --> 16:37.445
You have a lust for gold, for women.
And for whiskey.

16:37.525 --> 16:41.166
And above all else, you have lawlessness.

16:42.012 --> 16:46.564
And that, my new colleague friend,
is what brings me here today.

16:49.264 --> 16:52.031
You are looking for... lawlessness?

16:52.642 --> 16:55.874
No, no. But I am looking for an outlaw.

16:55.954 --> 17:00.465
And if I understand it correctly,
you currently have one in your custody.

17:00.677 --> 17:03.099
A particularly ruthless example.

17:03.644 --> 17:05.887
You name the half of it,
let me tell you.

17:07.108 --> 17:10.013
- Is he dangerous?
- And how.

17:10.214 --> 17:14.752
He killed four men. Killed a couple of
them fellas with his bare hands.

17:16.861 --> 17:19.115
I can let you have a look at him,
for two bits.

17:20.099 --> 17:23.489
Or you just wait till tomorrow noon
and see him swing for free.

17:24.261 --> 17:30.233
Ahhh! You're a businessman. How [fortunate]
it is, for I have a proposition for you.

17:30.468 --> 17:32.138
A very lucrative one.

17:33.310 --> 17:35.836
A propo... A pro...

17:37.798 --> 17:42.410
- What exactly are you getting at?
- I would like to pay you money.

17:43.489 --> 17:45.477
You want to pay me?
For what?

17:45.833 --> 17:49.783
- I would like to pay you 500 $.
- Five hundred?

17:50.990 --> 17:53.905
All you have to do is to turn your back
for a few minutes.

17:54.951 --> 17:57.223
Turn my back? To what?

17:57.810 --> 17:59.363
Your prisoner.
I need him.

17:59.567 --> 18:03.376
- You want me to give you the prisoner?
- No, no, no. I want you to

18:03.456 --> 18:07.031
turn your back and think of all the ways
you'll spend your money

18:09.454 --> 18:11.181
I'll take the prisoner myself.

18:12.447 --> 18:14.984
He's supposed to be hanged tomorrow.

18:15.639 --> 18:17.067
And I'll lose my job.

18:18.103 --> 18:22.191
And just how much do you earn
on this, um... job?

18:23.933 --> 18:25.347
Two dollars a week.

18:27.300 --> 18:33.074
So I am willing to pay you...
five years of your wages.

18:33.310 --> 18:37.252
And all you have to do,
is to close your eyes for two minutes.

18:42.086 --> 18:44.379
That's a... rather large raise.

18:47.027 --> 18:49.158
But I won't have my badge no more.

18:49.919 --> 18:54.449
You can tell everyone you fought validly against us.
We won't say a word.

18:54.607 --> 18:57.442
And you may even emerge from this a hero.

18:59.117 --> 19:04.223
You think people are gonna believe...
that an old guy... and a Chinaman...

19:04.767 --> 19:07.076
...roughed up Buford M. Wallace?

19:08.116 --> 19:10.430
...and rode off with his prisoner?

19:13.893 --> 19:17.718
It's gonna be pretty hard to believe... mister.

20:14.862 --> 20:18.511
- I present Baron Charles...
- Not necessary, my boy.

20:19.032 --> 20:21.267
He and I shall speak here as equals.

20:22.191 --> 20:25.714
How do you do, Mr. Chamberlain?
My name is Charles.

20:26.606 --> 20:29.185
I've come a long way to meet you.

20:41.093 --> 20:44.727
Mmm, quite an impressive specimen,
wouldn't you agree?

20:45.490 --> 20:49.893
- No sir, not to me.
- Oh come now lad, don't be rude.

20:50.486 --> 20:54.568
Look to ferocity in his eye.
Like that of a lion.

20:56.461 --> 21:01.823
I've hunted a lion, a huge male,
on the Serengeti, in my early years.

21:02.504 --> 21:07.640
It's speed and strength proved less...
formidable than my own skills.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.971
As a matter of fact, it was a rather easy kill.

21:11.673 --> 21:15.034
I'm curious to find out
whether you'll will [...] better.

21:23.698 --> 21:27.260
I can see in your eyes you're
already parting an escape.

21:28.507 --> 21:32.642
And that you would heavily kill both me
and my valet in order to achieve it.

21:33.125 --> 21:38.562
Oh, I admire that. It confirms one of the reasons
I've sought you out in the first place.

21:39.277 --> 21:42.614
However, I can assure you
that will be totally unnecessary,

21:42.891 --> 21:46.056
for when we have concluded our conversation here,

21:46.294 --> 21:51.461
I and my valet will free you from your chains
and we'll spirit you out of here.

21:59.178 --> 22:00.539
Say again?

22:01.961 --> 22:05.436
Ahh... so you DO understand me?

22:06.911 --> 22:11.645
My friend, I am a hunter.
I have hunted all the great beasts of the world,

22:11.725 --> 22:14.934
from the lion to the elephant,
from panther to the Kodiak bear.

22:14.954 --> 22:20.256
And I have killed them all.
But alas... they were all too easy.

22:20.718 --> 22:24.624
Never once that I experienced the thrill
of my own mortality.

22:25.099 --> 22:30.348
So I took the next logical step.
I began hunting... people.

22:31.790 --> 22:34.710
But not just any people,
really, really, no, I...

22:34.790 --> 22:38.664
began to target the world's great warriors.

22:39.243 --> 22:41.404
I killed a mighty Maori in New Zealand.

22:41.484 --> 22:45.148
A ferocious Sikh in the sweltering Punjab.

22:45.168 --> 22:49.421
Even a fearsome Zulu or two
on the plains of Southern Africa.

22:49.666 --> 22:51.666
Let me show you this.

23:02.287 --> 23:06.046
This... was [...] upon me by a Samurai.

23:06.480 --> 23:09.319
Do you know what a Samurai is?

23:10.599 --> 23:14.403
The Samurai, are the most incredible warriors.

23:14.685 --> 23:18.870
Intensely trained, highly skilled,
devilously clever and quick.

23:19.451 --> 23:21.836
The one I hunted almost killed me.

23:22.364 --> 23:25.885
Oh, it was a gruesome,
bloody fight to the death.

23:26.234 --> 23:31.888
But... as you can see, it was I
who prevailed at the end.

23:33.175 --> 23:34.155
The point is...

23:35.305 --> 23:40.333
...I have traveled far and wide to hunt
some of the world's greatest warriors.

23:40.781 --> 23:43.507
And now I'm here for you.

23:43.862 --> 23:49.576
The great Western <i>Desperado</i>, the ruthless outlaw,
who can kill men with his bare hands.

26:26.491 --> 26:30.632
Is it just me or is the air fresher
at this altitude?

26:32.306 --> 26:34.629
I divert at your judgment, sir.

26:37.702 --> 26:41.749
I believe it is!
And it has just inspired me, Kowloon.

26:45.728 --> 26:46.746
How so, sir?

26:47.049 --> 26:49.997
Perhaps after this adventure
we should travel to Nepal.

26:50.244 --> 26:53.533
The mountains there are even higher than these.

26:55.879 --> 26:58.990
There's a mountain range there
called 'The Kangchenjunga'.

26:59.287 --> 27:02.117
I believe it would make for a challenging
hunting ground.

27:03.310 --> 27:05.191
If you say so, sir.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.661
I knew it!

27:23.014 --> 27:24.160
Just as I predicted.

27:24.617 --> 27:29.294
He is taking the north side down, instead of
the eastern side, which is considerably easier.

27:29.914 --> 27:34.573
This means he understands what is happening and
he's using tactical thinking in order to elude me.

27:35.164 --> 27:37.442
What a promising beginning.

27:39.006 --> 27:41.463
Let's get going, Kowloon.
Don't dawdle.

28:59.040 --> 29:03.792
Ahh, you see? He thinks
my little gift might be a trap.

29:07.858 --> 29:09.490
He doesn't know me.

29:16.758 --> 29:18.469
He may think I'm just out for the kill,

29:18.645 --> 29:21.543
but it's the hunt! The hunt that is everything.

29:22.007 --> 29:24.475
I am fair with my prey...

29:24.966 --> 29:28.969
...one thing I am not, however... is patient.

29:40.917 --> 29:43.757
That was just a warning shot, Mr. Chamberlain.

29:46.710 --> 29:49.556
But now try havoc!

30:28.024 --> 30:32.837
You might have hit me, if hadn't been informed
as to the range of your weapon!

30:33.937 --> 30:36.372
Why do you think I'm standing so far back?

30:37.427 --> 30:42.730
However, I am also informed
as to the extreme range of my rifle!

30:54.031 --> 30:57.919
This is getting VERY interesting.
That's what life is all about.

30:58.293 --> 31:03.613
A fair fight, a leveled playing field.
Kowloon, we are switching to revolver.

31:03.962 --> 31:06.211
Let me have no advantage.

31:43.792 --> 31:45.939
Stay in good cover, Kowloon.

34:43.945 --> 34:46.360
I count six, Mr. Chamberlain.

34:47.699 --> 34:51.335
You - are out of ammunition. I - am not.

35:01.959 --> 35:03.167
Kowloon!

35:10.497 --> 35:14.893
That was exhilarating!
Now please hand me my rifle.

35:17.464 --> 35:20.652
And be so kind as to reload that.

37:23.226 --> 37:27.683
Nothing feels better than existing EXACTLY
the way we were meant to.

37:28.161 --> 37:30.819
I never feel more live than when I'm on my hunt!

37:31.613 --> 37:33.712
I noticed that, sir.

37:34.399 --> 37:36.182
And have you noticed this?

37:41.494 --> 37:44.461
These tracks remain steady
in one general direction.

37:44.825 --> 37:47.839
It's only a cause when one knows
where one is headed.

37:48.790 --> 37:51.244
Could it be he is familiar with this terrain?

37:51.504 --> 37:54.809
It's possible we didn't take him
far enough away from town.

37:55.379 --> 37:59.659
So based on what you know, Kowloon,
what would you say our chances are?

38:00.315 --> 38:01.997
I never bet against you, sir.

38:02.917 --> 38:06.094
A fine sentiment, but this is not about gambling.

38:06.174 --> 38:09.702
It is about education,
observe this hunt closely.

38:09.782 --> 38:12.890
For it may be a value to you one day.

38:13.655 --> 38:15.242
Well! Off we go.

38:49.633 --> 38:53.621
Regrettably, my boy,
it makes fools of us all.

38:54.623 --> 38:58.212
But it's not over. We'll split out.

38:58.992 --> 39:00.810
I continue to follow his tracks,

39:01.923 --> 39:05.595
and you flank him... from the North.
He is likely exhausted as well.

39:06.568 --> 39:10.767
If you spot him... fire this. Into the air.

39:12.102 --> 39:14.015
The kill is mine, remember.

41:08.673 --> 41:12.198
Guns are for old men and women.
We are neither.

41:14.223 --> 41:16.084
You know how to fight like a man.

41:18.862 --> 41:20.284
Yes, I do.

41:36.561 --> 41:40.825
- So you don't like guns?
- No. Guns are for cowards.

41:42.306 --> 41:44.403
Didn't your people invent gunpowder?

41:44.904 --> 41:47.245
The Baron thinks highly
of your skill as a warrior.

41:48.841 --> 41:49.767
I don't.

46:17.146 --> 46:19.929
I don’t take kindly to trespassers here.

46:21.472 --> 46:23.348
Put your hands up.

47:39.948 --> 47:41.092
Kowloon?

47:50.700 --> 47:51.908
Oh, no.

47:56.638 --> 48:01.089
Please don't be dead, for I will never
be able to forgive you.

48:03.847 --> 48:05.764
Forgive me for what, sir?

48:09.830 --> 48:12.734
For dying before you have
truly lived, my boy.

48:16.722 --> 48:18.215
I met Mr. Chamberlain.

48:18.696 --> 48:21.018
He wanted to leave and I he should stay.

48:22.014 --> 48:25.359
- You were late, sir.
- My apologies, I lost the trail.

48:25.588 --> 48:29.301
Briefly. So... you fought?

48:29.504 --> 48:30.468
Yes.

48:32.022 --> 48:33.195
So now he is dead?

48:33.458 --> 48:36.675
Well, I specifically reserved
the pleasure to kill to myself!

48:36.930 --> 48:41.794
- He's alive and... fairly well, sir.
- How is that possible?

48:42.592 --> 48:45.430
He cheated.
He threw a rock at me.

48:46.205 --> 48:49.005
A rock? But that's just simply not cricket!

48:49.384 --> 48:52.368
But... that would explain
your current discomfort.

48:52.867 --> 48:56.792
- It would explain your mistake.
- My mistake?

48:57.179 --> 49:00.648
Yes, you assumed you were fighting
a civilized man.

49:00.837 --> 49:04.368
Not a barbarian who makes up
his own rules as he goes along.

49:04.862 --> 49:08.552
But - no harm done. Except you, of course.

49:10.642 --> 49:13.698
One day you may thank Mr. Chamberlain
for this encounter.

49:14.427 --> 49:17.404
'Cause we learn more from our failures
than our successes.

49:17.695 --> 49:21.679
This has made you smarter, stronger and deadlier.

49:22.210 --> 49:25.527
- Do you understand?
- I do, sir.

49:26.011 --> 49:27.864
Good. Well...

49:28.207 --> 49:31.418
...now that you're alive and...
sufficiently rested...

49:32.030 --> 49:34.124
...I want you to set up camp here for the night.

49:34.379 --> 49:36.358
The hunt will resume on tomorrow.

49:36.860 --> 49:38.109
In earnest.

50:32.849 --> 50:35.395
We don't get many visitors here in these parts.

50:41.102 --> 50:42.019
We?

50:44.196 --> 50:47.188
Okay, I don't get many visitors.

50:52.374 --> 50:53.746
You here alone?

50:55.143 --> 50:58.339
No, I'm here with my friend.
Winchester.

51:01.769 --> 51:06.403
Oh... I took you gun. You didn't have
any ammunition, anyway.

51:16.170 --> 51:17.745
Any men folk around here?

51:20.304 --> 51:22.473
The war took my brother and my father.

51:28.418 --> 51:29.378
Husband?

51:31.135 --> 51:36.382
The war didn't take him. He... left.

51:36.974 --> 51:38.948
On his own.

51:46.844 --> 51:48.453
You got any children?

51:50.643 --> 51:54.399
Not that is any of your business... No.

51:55.937 --> 51:57.798
That's why my husband left.

52:04.889 --> 52:06.643
I'm sorry to hear that.

52:08.797 --> 52:09.992
Don't be.

52:15.585 --> 52:17.755
Mind if I join you at the table?

52:38.587 --> 52:41.001
What are you doing here,
in the middle of nowhere?

52:43.257 --> 52:44.716
Are you running from the law?

52:48.150 --> 52:50.154
Something worse.

52:56.073 --> 52:57.659
How can I help you?

53:00.664 --> 53:02.147
Water.

53:11.124 --> 53:12.247
Kowloon!

53:12.892 --> 53:17.155
One should never pass up the opportunity
to admire something like this.

53:26.660 --> 53:28.307
But, sir, the hunt?

53:29.063 --> 53:33.471
If we should let something, as magnificent
as this, pass our gaze without notice,

53:33.766 --> 53:36.161
we should rightly be called joyless.

53:36.748 --> 53:41.265
We are merely out for a kill, that will make us
no better than the animals.

53:42.069 --> 53:44.367
But we better ourselves with the hunt.

53:44.818 --> 53:47.698
By challenging and defeating a worthy opponent,

53:47.950 --> 53:49.732
we improve ourselves.

53:50.277 --> 53:54.031
Experiencing joy is a part of that process.

53:55.560 --> 53:57.450
Understood, sir.

53:57.707 --> 54:02.783
Now. Did we bring along that old whiskey
that we procured in Scotland?

54:03.235 --> 54:06.916
- Yes, sir.
- And what does that whiskey prove?

54:07.622 --> 54:11.244
That even the Scottish aren't completely useless?

54:12.226 --> 54:16.623
You learn very well. Now, be a good lad
and pour me a small shot.

55:21.631 --> 55:25.649
- Breakfast?
- Thank you.

55:40.769 --> 55:45.452
- You got a lot of nice tools here.
- Yes, my father was a blacksmith.

55:47.240 --> 55:51.722
- Do you know 'to use them?
- My grandfather taught me how.

55:55.118 --> 55:57.517
It's a shame they are going to waste now.

56:13.174 --> 56:14.977
This place is a paradise.

56:19.523 --> 56:21.175
It could be.

56:27.443 --> 56:30.166
You know, you could stay here for a few days.

56:30.467 --> 56:32.951
Just... long enough to regain your strength.

56:38.659 --> 56:41.924
I wish I could. I really do.

56:45.752 --> 56:48.716
You got someone waiting on you?

56:50.135 --> 56:55.602
- Yes, ma'am.
- Um... special someone?

56:57.210 --> 56:59.004
Yes, ma'am.

57:07.670 --> 57:13.217
I was thinking... you know, you could use
some extra time.

57:16.377 --> 57:21.914
but, um... I've been alone for a long time.
And I'm used to it.

57:27.069 --> 57:28.796
Oh, your gun.

57:35.092 --> 57:38.633
I have some extra ammo,
so I loaded it for you.

57:42.478 --> 57:45.018
Go on, take it.

59:05.875 --> 59:07.362
There he is...

59:07.981 --> 59:12.030
Prepare yourself, Kowloon, the chase
is about to resume.

59:52.602 --> 59:54.142
What is this?

01:00:07.338 --> 01:00:11.478
It seems that for the first time we may have
a surrender on our hands.

01:00:18.999 --> 01:00:22.091
I may have misjudged this Western warrior.

01:00:24.498 --> 01:00:26.446
So did I once.

01:00:45.329 --> 01:00:47.064
Hold there.

01:00:53.606 --> 01:00:58.671
Do I surmise that you acquiesce to my
superior skill and tenacity?

01:01:10.881 --> 01:01:12.627
Hell no.

01:01:14.244 --> 01:01:18.681
What the devil are you doing?
A sense of fair play does have it's limits.

01:01:19.917 --> 01:01:22.828
I say we end this here. Now.

01:01:24.052 --> 01:01:29.066
I see. And how exactly do you propose
to accomplish that?

01:01:31.948 --> 01:01:35.720
You and me, man to man. Pistols.

01:01:37.332 --> 01:01:39.361
Until it's done.

01:01:42.086 --> 01:01:43.906
A duel?

01:01:44.813 --> 01:01:49.213
Kowloon, this hunt has suddenly started
to exceed my wildest expectations.

01:01:50.517 --> 01:01:52.979
What are the Western rules?

01:01:53.732 --> 01:01:56.164
Unholster your weapon fast, and aim true.

01:01:57.570 --> 01:01:59.148
Simple enough.

01:02:00.089 --> 01:02:04.587
Very well. I find your terms
to be very... agreeable.

01:02:06.799 --> 01:02:12.249
Would you allow me, on your honor,
to... properly equip myself?

01:02:23.478 --> 01:02:27.270
I admire this man, Kowloon. So much solve it.

01:02:28.303 --> 01:02:31.237
I believe that I must kill him now.

01:02:31.528 --> 01:02:33.371
Excellent.

01:02:56.994 --> 01:03:01.517
Take cover, Kowloon.
That shouldn't be... but a moment.

01:04:05.189 --> 01:04:08.928
<I>It seems I have been bested at last, Kowloon...

01:04:09.908 --> 01:04:14.319
But do not... despair... for I
have lived my life.

01:04:14.789 --> 01:04:19.830
- I have... truly lived.
- I don't know what I'll do.

01:04:20.384 --> 01:04:23.259
Nonsense, I've taught you well.

01:04:24.497 --> 01:04:27.317
And I... am prepared for the unexpected.

01:04:28.038 --> 01:04:32.491
In my... pocket... you will find
my... legal will.

01:04:33.711 --> 01:04:36.767
I leave all my remaining wealth... to you.

01:04:37.738 --> 01:04:41.234
Use it wisely. Improve yourself... always.

01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:43.866
Never stop advancing, you hear?!

01:04:45.451 --> 01:04:48.472
[...]. Oh, Baron, don't leave.

01:04:49.864 --> 01:04:54.745
No trouble, my boy. I'm merely
[...] face another adventure.

01:04:56.302 --> 01:04:58.664
The greatest... one of all.

01:05:20.294 --> 01:05:23.981
- Okay, is everybody here?
- Buford, where's the sheriff?

01:05:24.193 --> 01:05:26.175
He went to County-C, for court day.

01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:28.814
He even know you pulled up a posse?

01:05:29.257 --> 01:05:31.021
- He left me in charge, didn't he?

01:05:31.101 --> 01:05:34.932
Seems strange leave you in charge
after you lost that one prisoner.

01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:39.263
I didn't lose anybody.
His gang came, took him from me.

01:05:39.758 --> 01:05:42.465
I'm a hired gun, ain't gonna do this for no pay.

01:05:42.770 --> 01:05:47.281
You're gonna get paid. And don't forget
I overlooked the fact that you're a deserter.

01:05:47.959 --> 01:05:52.792
Did your time, my ass. You jumped two feet
when you saw my badge yesterday.

01:05:53.544 --> 01:05:56.617
Don't forget I know something
about every man here.

01:05:57.979 --> 01:06:02.796
Does anybody else want to shoot off your mouth?
I didn't think so.

01:06:04.395 --> 01:06:05.860
What's the plan?

01:06:06.794 --> 01:06:09.753
Chamberlain's gonna try to sneak
in here, all quiet-like.

01:06:10.328 --> 01:06:13.909
To slip away with his little girl
before anyone knows he's here.

01:06:15.473 --> 01:06:18.196
Here comes Mrs. Habishaw from the orphanage.

01:06:27.328 --> 01:06:31.837
- She has our bait.
- But ain't it wrong to use a man's kid as bait?

01:06:32.255 --> 01:06:35.072
Ain't it wrong to gun people down
in cold blood?

01:06:35.785 --> 01:06:39.081
- That man is wanted for murder.
- Mr. Wallace.

01:06:39.458 --> 01:06:43.469
Did I just hear one of your men
refer to this innocent child?

01:06:43.744 --> 01:06:48.418
- As bait?
- He didn't mean nothing like.

01:06:48.719 --> 01:06:50.870
I should hope not.

01:06:51.467 --> 01:06:53.164
Have your men been drinking?

01:06:54.978 --> 01:06:58.607
No more than normal - for a man
who's put his life on the line.

01:06:59.342 --> 01:07:02.027
Oh, liquored at, waiting for a gunfight?

01:07:02.516 --> 01:07:06.622
I closed the streets off. You shouldn't even
be here, Mrs. Habishaw.

01:07:06.974 --> 01:07:10.984
In case you've forgotten,
you were the one who told us to be here.

01:07:13.084 --> 01:07:15.995
Alright, why don't you go
wait at the office, then?

01:07:17.663 --> 01:07:21.497
Go in the back, no stray bullet
should get you there.

01:07:25.716 --> 01:07:27.853
Come on now, [...].

01:07:38.009 --> 01:07:42.324
- You know why I'm here.
- Oh, I know a lot of things.

01:07:42.639 --> 01:07:44.551
Don't you mess with me, Buford.

01:07:48.637 --> 01:07:52.223
I want my daughter.
I want to take her out of here.

01:07:53.387 --> 01:07:55.280
We all live.

01:07:56.135 --> 01:07:58.355
I know you got those men with you.

01:07:58.947 --> 01:08:04.015
And if you try anything, as God is my witness,
I will kill every last one of you sons o'bitches.

01:11:01.384 --> 01:11:05.301
So what's it gonna be, Buford?
Just you and me.

01:11:31.909 --> 01:11:33.656
Who is that?

01:11:35.531 --> 01:11:37.386
An army deserter.

01:11:37.811 --> 01:11:39.645
Came here yesterday.

01:11:41.142 --> 01:11:45.078
No, it's not. It's a famous outlaw, Chamberlain.

01:11:47.431 --> 01:11:48.883
You got him.

01:11:52.056 --> 01:11:54.153
He killed your posse when you killed him.

01:11:57.524 --> 01:11:59.458
I killed him?

01:12:05.968 --> 01:12:08.745
- But what about...
- Well, congratulations, Deputy.

01:12:09.752 --> 01:12:12.427
Looks like you have been a hero
when everyone [...].

01:12:14.736 --> 01:12:16.710
Most everyone.

01:12:19.559 --> 01:12:21.815
Bet you'll even get a reward.

01:12:23.194 --> 01:12:25.674
But you make damn sure he's buried put,
when Sheriff gets back.

01:12:26.264 --> 01:12:28.125
And do it yourself, do you hear?

01:13:40.599 --> 01:13:43.557
Daddy, who is that?

01:13:50.898 --> 01:13:54.165
Is this the special someone you told me about?

01:13:55.744 --> 01:13:58.575
Yeah, this is my daughter Leia.

01:14:00.333 --> 01:14:04.497
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

01:14:07.174 --> 01:14:10.556
I was wondering if you still needed
that blacksmith?

01:14:11.498 --> 01:14:14.209
Oh, it is not a temporary position.
