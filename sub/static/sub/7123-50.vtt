Ohh-ohh!

01:33.051 --> 01:34.519
Hello!

01:34.595 --> 01:37.394
And keep away from
Castle Lemongrab!

01:41.018 --> 01:43.020
How are you today?

01:43.103 --> 01:45.151
Mm! I see. Yes.

01:45.230 --> 01:48.825
I'm inside my fortified
totalitarian city state.

01:48.900 --> 01:51.244
Hello. I'm Lemongrab.

01:51.320 --> 01:52.947
M-M-Me too!

01:53.030 --> 01:55.533
Ow! - Unacceptable.

01:55.616 --> 01:59.666
Things have never been better
here at Castle Lemongrab.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.624
I have never been fatter.

02:03.707 --> 02:06.961
And since the expulsion
of Lemonhope,

02:07.044 --> 02:12.642
we have reached peak
societal obediency.

02:12.716 --> 02:16.562
Law, order, heart-smashing...

02:19.473 --> 02:22.272
Mm! The pleasure!

02:22.351 --> 02:25.070
Smash another!

02:25.145 --> 02:28.615
Oh! Who is this?

02:28.690 --> 02:31.284
"I'm one of my subjects.

02:31.360 --> 02:33.954
I'm being punished for
helping Lemonhope.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.997
But that's okay."

02:44.456 --> 02:46.504
Yes, morale has
never been higher

02:46.583 --> 02:48.585
since we got rid of hope.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.974
In conclusion, no one
needs to come here ever,

02:55.050 --> 02:57.052
especially Lemonhope,
and I ate my brother.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.478
Goodbye!

03:02.683 --> 03:04.185
Save us, Lemonhope!

03:04.267 --> 03:05.519
You're our only Lemonho...

03:08.605 --> 03:10.607
Lights on.

03:10.691 --> 03:13.865
Oh, Lemonhope, were you
even paying attention?

03:13.944 --> 03:17.949
Uhhhh, yes.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.534
I know this is a lotto take in,

03:20.617 --> 03:22.494
but one day, saving those lemons

03:22.577 --> 03:24.545
is going to be your
responsibility.

03:24.621 --> 03:28.046
They're in trouble, and you
need to work harder at this.

03:31.002 --> 03:32.345
I don't know.

03:32.421 --> 03:35.015
I'm not too worried about
other people, I guess.

03:35.090 --> 03:40.062
Like, I got me, and
they got them.

03:40.137 --> 03:42.265
Okay-

03:42.347 --> 03:45.351
Let's try something else.

03:45.434 --> 03:48.563
These are cupcakes. - Cup-cups!

03:48.645 --> 03:51.569
Lemonhope, you
have two cupcakes.

03:51.648 --> 03:54.572
Finn has <i>no</i> cupcakes.

03:54.651 --> 03:59.077
Lemonhope, will you give
Finn one of your cupcakes?

03:59.156 --> 04:01.659
- Ummmmm...
- Yes.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.291
Ohh. But I don't want to.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.463
I want <i>both</i> cupcakes.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.632
Finn can get his own cupcakes.

04:13.837 --> 04:16.305
Maybe we need something
more hands-on.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.884
Hey, Finn, listen, that's
it for class today.

04:18.966 --> 04:22.016
Whoop! Whoop! Whoop!
Whoop! Whoop!

04:22.095 --> 04:24.439
But read the next three
chapters of your geometry text!

04:24.514 --> 04:26.482
Well, at least
he's street-smart.

04:26.558 --> 04:30.062
Okay, dude, we're going
on a field trip.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.699
This is the Lemon
Earldom perimeter.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.622
Unfortunately, there
are pacts and treaties

04:40.697 --> 04:42.950
preventing me from
getting any closer.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.956
We should cloak.

04:47.412 --> 04:50.211
I know you don't like thinking
about Castle Lemongrab,

04:50.290 --> 04:52.042
but it's where your family is.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.379
They set you free, and now
they're being punished for it.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.009
It rips.

04:57.088 --> 04:59.466
Look.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.599
Remember Lemonhope!

05:12.020 --> 05:14.364
I'm going to eat you!

05:14.439 --> 05:16.533
No! No! No!

05:21.446 --> 05:23.289
I did it!

05:23.365 --> 05:25.959
Do you see? They helped you.

05:26.034 --> 05:29.334
You have to help them now.
It's your responsibility.

05:29.412 --> 05:30.709
No!

05:30.789 --> 05:33.383
I don't have to do anything
that I don't want to!

05:33.458 --> 05:35.005
They set me free!

05:35.085 --> 05:37.304
And "free" means
/decide what I do,

05:37.379 --> 05:39.973
not them, and not you!

05:40.048 --> 05:43.678
Dude, I'm sorry, but that
attitude is unacceptable.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.637

but I think I...
really need some help.

08:50.238 --> 08:53.788
Hey. Hey, guy, back here.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.541
I think I might have
fallen off back there.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.462

08:58.538 --> 09:00.711

09:57.847 --> 10:00.691
Nothing like juice
for breakfast.
