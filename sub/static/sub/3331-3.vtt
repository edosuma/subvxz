She's dead, Luke. Mother's dead.

00:08.926 --> 00:12.180

suspects that we have our own agenda.

00:19.061 --> 00:21.314
- I'll do whatever you want.
HOPKINS: It's Mark Gray.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.403

00:23.565 --> 00:26.910
Tell the world how you executed
my mother or Clarke dies.

00:27.069 --> 00:29.697
Looks like your friends
did not come through for you.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.537
The dimensions
have been carefully calculated.

00:32.698 --> 00:34.201
- For what?
- To put you in.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.751
Ryan, a video just came through.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.540
My name is Jeffrey Clarke.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.550
I sanctioned an FBI black ops unit...

00:42.709 --> 00:45.508
...led by Agent Ryan Hardy.
People were killed.

Help me.

01:47.399 --> 01:50.403
There you are. I've been calling you.

01:55.157 --> 01:56.579
Hey.

01:56.742 --> 01:58.494
You okay?

01:59.286 --> 02:00.833
What's wrong?

02:05.792 --> 02:06.839
Nothing.

02:22.768 --> 02:25.863
Whoever put Clarke in that box
didn't come up with this yesterday.

02:26.021 --> 02:29.150
He's done it before.
So search similar MOs in the tristate area.

02:29.316 --> 02:32.115
Go back five years.
If you don't get a hit, go back 10.

02:32.277 --> 02:33.369
Yeah, got it.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.872
I don't think that box
was their first plan.

02:36.031 --> 02:40.377
After we took out their buddy in the
auto shop, Mark had to improvise.

02:40.535 --> 02:44.005
- Meaning they might've slipped up.
- I'm betting they left a trail.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.667
That's how we find them,
that's how we end this.

02:46.833 --> 02:48.881
Are you ready for the press conference?

02:49.044 --> 02:52.514
- I don't have time for that.
- The allegations were about your team.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.846
You don't show up,
it looks like we're hiding you.

02:55.008 --> 02:57.761
I kept a lid on the tableau murders,
the Mark Gray connection...

02:57.928 --> 03:00.556
...but every major network
picked up Clarke's confession.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.896
- They're gonna ask me if there's truth to it.
- You'll say no.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.565
Will I be lying?

03:07.062 --> 03:09.906
Gina, you and I have been through a lot.

03:10.065 --> 03:12.944
I will tell you anything
that you want to know.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.911
But I think we're both aware that there
are certain disadvantages to that.

03:22.494 --> 03:23.996
Let's go.

After more than two decades
of service to the FBI...

03:28.500 --> 03:33.097

was kidnapped and murdered yesterday.

03:33.255 --> 03:35.678
The entire Bureau mourns his loss.

03:35.841 --> 03:40.438
He will be missed as a colleague,
but even more so as a friend.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.100
These are our suspects in the case.

03:45.267 --> 03:48.771
They are a Caucasian couple,
late 20s, early 30s.

03:48.937 --> 03:51.941
They should be considered armed
and dangerous.

03:52.107 --> 03:54.735

Oh, my God.

- How do they have sketches of us?
- I don't know.

If we are ID'd, our home, everything...

04:03.201 --> 04:05.750
...we worked so hard to protect,
that's gonna be gone.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.136
Babies?

04:23.138 --> 04:25.641
- Are you...?
- No, I'm not.

04:25.807 --> 04:27.980
But I... I want to be.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.486
I promise.

04:29.644 --> 04:32.318
I promise, we will go home, okay?

- My question is for Ryan Hardy.

No, it's okay.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.842
I got it.

05:01.468 --> 05:05.348
Agent Clarke alleged
that you murdered Lily Gray.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.603
Is there any truth to that allegation?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.151
No, there is not.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.777
Special Agent Clarke...

05:10.936 --> 05:14.190
...was under duress and said whatever
he needed to say to stay alive.

05:14.356 --> 05:17.530
If I may, he referred to
a lawless FBI black op.

05:17.692 --> 05:20.366
These were questions raised
in the congressional hearing.

05:20.529 --> 05:23.703
And every single member of my team
was fully exonerated.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.708
He's still lying.

05:25.867 --> 05:28.541
And look at those reporters.
They're believing this crap.

He did this. He is responsible.

05:50.892 --> 05:53.566
Excuse me, Mark Gray is responsible?
He's been spotted?

We believe he's in the New York area,

He's a delusional coward...

But his days are numbered
because I'm coming for him.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.660
If he's smart, he'll turn himself in.

06:08.827 --> 06:14.425
Because the full force of the FBI
is about to land on him and his followers.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.252
They're such liars.

was asphyxiation after the victim...

...was forced in a small space. She had the
same pithing marks on the skull Clarke has.

- None.

Last time I helped you, you put a wire

A friend of mine was murdered.

12:30.291 --> 12:33.921
I think you could help me find who did it.
The killer had another victim.

A woman who had a fetish
about being in small, enclosed spaces.

...bent, broke...

12:52.605 --> 12:56.485

He was a good man.

He considers himself an artist,

But I've never met him. Never wanted to.
