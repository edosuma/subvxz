WEBVTT

00:03.043 --> 00:05.391
You know what you
got there, Barrett?
Nope.

00:05.434 --> 00:07.434
Each phantom operative
was tagged with a microchip,

00:07.478 --> 00:10.086
giving them access worldwide
to the Watcher database.

00:10.130 --> 00:11.739
EJ, who told you
to come here tonight?

00:11.782 --> 00:12.782
I thought you did.

00:12.826 --> 00:14.086
[gunfire]

00:14.130 --> 00:16.000
So, who'd you shoot,
Agent DiNozzo?

00:16.043 --> 00:17.826
TONY:
I need your help.

00:17.869 --> 00:19.565
I don't know. Can't
remember any of it.

00:19.608 --> 00:20.565
STRATTON:
Special Agent Gibbs?

00:20.608 --> 00:22.043
Agent Stratton, FBI.

00:22.086 --> 00:24.130
VANCE: Gentlemen, I intend to find out

00:24.173 --> 00:25.086
who Casey Stratton really is.

00:25.130 --> 00:26.347
Bureau doesn't know.

00:26.391 --> 00:27.521
We got stills from
hospital security,

00:27.565 --> 00:29.565
but he hasn't turned up
on any database.

00:29.608 --> 00:30.608
Your girl's still missing?

00:30.652 --> 00:31.869
Unfortunately.

00:31.913 --> 00:34.434
Find Agent Barrett.

00:48.434 --> 00:50.000
Child abuse is what it is.

00:50.043 --> 00:51.956
No more junk food
at my house.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
No more video games at mine.

00:53.043 --> 00:54.869
Stupid New Year's
resolutions.

00:54.913 --> 00:56.434
They make them, and we suffer.

00:56.478 --> 00:58.043
I swear, I can't
wait to grow up

00:58.086 --> 00:59.565
and move out of
this puny old town.

00:59.608 --> 01:01.173
Nothing ever
happens here anyway.

01:01.217 --> 01:02.173
[tires screech, crash]

01:02.217 --> 01:03.260
What?

01:03.304 --> 01:04.869
[tires screech]

01:04.913 --> 01:07.043
[car alarm blaring]

01:09.130 --> 01:11.043
Come on.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.043
Whoa.

01:14.086 --> 01:16.043
[grunts]

01:16.086 --> 01:18.086
You okay, mister?

01:22.000 --> 01:24.043
[gasps]

01:57.565 --> 01:59.000
[elevator bell dings]

02:00.782 --> 02:02.782
[groans]
No.

02:02.826 --> 02:04.000
[sighs]

02:04.043 --> 02:05.000
Morning!

02:05.043 --> 02:07.043
Hey.
Meh.

02:07.086 --> 02:08.695
I never thought
I'd end up being known

02:08.739 --> 02:10.130
as the cheerful one
at the office.

02:10.173 --> 02:11.478
Wait, what?

02:11.521 --> 02:12.826
Are you saying
we're not cheerful?

02:12.869 --> 02:14.913
Last couple weeks,
I'd say more--

02:14.956 --> 02:16.086
I don't know-- surly.

02:16.130 --> 02:17.913
Surly?Surly you're Mc-staken.

02:17.956 --> 02:20.130
Didn't seem that way at the
Navy District New Year's party.

02:20.173 --> 02:21.130
Ha! Gotcha!

02:21.173 --> 02:22.478
'Cause I didn't even go

02:22.521 --> 02:24.086
to the Naval District
New Year's Eve party.

02:24.130 --> 02:25.173
Neither did I.

02:25.217 --> 02:26.521
Then I rest my case.

02:26.565 --> 02:28.260
Since when do either of you
ever miss a party?

02:30.086 --> 02:32.043
Also known as
the holiday blues.

02:32.086 --> 02:33.086
Pre and post.

02:33.130 --> 02:34.521
Not at all uncommon.

02:34.565 --> 02:36.739
That'll do, Dr. Phil.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.565
I don't suppose
you heard anything

02:40.608 --> 02:42.260
from C.I.Ray over the holidays,
did you?

02:42.304 --> 02:43.956
What about you?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
Weren't you
supposed to visit

02:45.043 --> 02:47.000
your old flame in Baltimore?

02:47.043 --> 02:48.478
Wendy. Yes.

02:48.521 --> 02:49.304
Hmm.

02:49.347 --> 02:50.304
Something came up.

02:50.347 --> 02:51.173
Yeah, like a U-turn.

02:51.217 --> 02:52.347
[laughs]

02:52.391 --> 02:53.739
Told you to stifle, Edith.

02:53.782 --> 02:55.086
I don't have
the blues,

02:55.130 --> 02:57.260
I just have the blahs, you know?

02:57.304 --> 02:58.391
Every time New Year's

02:58.434 --> 03:00.043
comes around,
just kind of... whack.

03:00.086 --> 03:01.478
I don't know.

03:01.521 --> 03:03.304
Well, only you can do
something about that, Tony.

03:03.347 --> 03:05.826
Change, my dear,
requires some action.

03:05.869 --> 03:08.652
This coming from a woman
who's been waiting

03:08.695 --> 03:10.086
eight weeks for

03:10.130 --> 03:13.173
a single, solitary phone call
from one lousy dude.

03:13.217 --> 03:15.173
Seven. And maybe
I'm done waiting.

03:15.217 --> 03:18.043
Maybe it's finally time
we both took some action.

03:18.086 --> 03:19.043
Maybe...

03:19.086 --> 03:20.652
No time for maybes.

03:20.695 --> 03:22.086
Got a dead Naval officer.

03:22.130 --> 03:23.260
There's nothing
maybe about that.

03:23.304 --> 03:24.260
Let's go.

03:28.086 --> 03:29.130
To be continued?

03:29.173 --> 03:30.304
Maybe.

03:30.347 --> 03:32.478
DUCKY:
One gunshot wound
to the neck,

03:32.521 --> 03:34.565
one to the chest
that I can see.

03:34.608 --> 03:38.173
Given the angle of
entry, both were fired

03:38.217 --> 03:39.782
from the commander's
immediate right.

03:42.521 --> 03:44.913
Ergo, "riding shotgun."

03:45.913 --> 03:47.000
Too easy?

03:47.043 --> 03:48.478
Too surly.

03:48.521 --> 03:52.043
Navy Commander
James Barnsway, 35.

03:52.086 --> 03:53.826
Those kids were
first on the scene.

03:53.869 --> 03:56.869
Said they heard a loud screech
of tires and then the crash.

03:56.913 --> 03:57.913
Passenger door's open.

03:57.956 --> 03:59.478
Well, they didn't see
any passenger.

03:59.521 --> 04:01.000
There are no bullet casings
in the truck.

04:01.043 --> 04:04.086
Lack of stippling on this wound
would indicate a distance

04:04.130 --> 04:06.130
greater than the passenger seat.

04:06.173 --> 04:08.000
Passenger window's open.

04:08.043 --> 04:09.217
What are you thinking, DiNozzo?

04:09.260 --> 04:10.782
It's more like
what I'm not seeing, boss.

04:10.826 --> 04:12.217
There's no skid marks
here for the pickup,

04:12.260 --> 04:15.304
which means he ran full steam
into that car.

04:15.347 --> 04:17.130
Kids said they heard
a tire screech;

04:17.173 --> 04:19.217
probably came from those
skid marks right there.

04:19.260 --> 04:20.478
Hmm? Alongside.

04:20.521 --> 04:21.869
Making it possible
the shots were fired

04:21.913 --> 04:22.956
from a second vehicle.

04:23.000 --> 04:23.956
TONY:
Yeah, that was

04:24.000 --> 04:25.652
kind of my point.
Ziva.

04:27.913 --> 04:30.086
ZIVA:
Uh-huh.

04:30.130 --> 04:32.782
More than possible.

04:32.826 --> 04:36.086
Had to be riding high
to get that angle.

04:36.130 --> 04:37.130
Hell of a shot.

04:37.173 --> 04:39.130
The boys didn't hear
any shots fired.

04:39.173 --> 04:41.000
Just the crash.

04:41.043 --> 04:43.304
Well, then a hell of a
shot with a silencer.

04:45.608 --> 04:49.173
DiNozzo, Ziva.

04:50.695 --> 04:52.956
TONY:
On it, boss.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.956
I'm the one
who called the police.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.347
But you have to understand, I'm
not one for getting involved.

04:58.391 --> 04:59.304
But you did see the crash?

04:59.347 --> 05:01.086
No, heard it.

05:01.130 --> 05:02.434
What exactly did you see?

05:02.478 --> 05:05.043
Well-- Yes, yeah,
go right there.

05:05.086 --> 05:06.434
I got to the window

05:06.478 --> 05:09.173
just as that other car
was speeding off.

05:09.217 --> 05:10.347
What kind of car was that?

05:10.391 --> 05:12.043
One of those SUVs.

05:12.086 --> 05:13.173
Blue.

05:13.217 --> 05:15.173
Oh, no, wait.

05:15.217 --> 05:16.478
Uh, it was green.

05:17.478 --> 05:19.130
Or gold.

05:20.217 --> 05:22.391
Did you hear anything
like gunshots?

05:22.434 --> 05:24.043
Oh, Lord, no.

05:24.086 --> 05:26.565
I can't imagine that girl would
have got out of Jimmy's truck

05:26.608 --> 05:27.565
if there'd been gunshots.

05:27.608 --> 05:29.173
There was a girl?

05:29.217 --> 05:31.043
Pretty blond.

05:31.086 --> 05:33.130
Ran off into the woods
over there.

05:33.173 --> 05:34.956
Or maybe it was red.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.956
Oh, the SUV,
not her hair.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.173
That was definitely blond.

05:40.391 --> 05:41.434
Ish.

05:41.478 --> 05:42.826
Well...

05:42.869 --> 05:44.130
So, you know the commander?

05:44.173 --> 05:46.434
Jimmy, yes.

05:46.478 --> 05:48.304
Man is a war hero.

05:48.347 --> 05:50.043
He didn't look too good.

05:50.086 --> 05:51.434
Is he gonna be all right?

05:51.478 --> 05:53.173
What about the girl?
You know her, too?

05:53.217 --> 05:57.260
No, but I will tell you,
it wasn't Mrs. Jimmy.

05:57.304 --> 05:59.391
Not that I'm one
for getting involved.

05:59.434 --> 06:00.521
So, the commander has a wife?

06:00.565 --> 06:02.043
Oh, Cara, yes.

06:02.086 --> 06:04.000
Sings in our church choir.

06:04.043 --> 06:05.043
Poor Cara.

06:05.086 --> 06:08.043
It'll pain me so
to have to tell her.

06:08.086 --> 06:09.217
I'm really not one for...

06:09.260 --> 06:10.913
Getting involved.
Yes, we know, we know.

06:10.956 --> 06:12.130
TONY:
We'll save you
the trouble.

06:12.173 --> 06:13.173
It's no trouble.

06:13.217 --> 06:14.521
I can give Cara a call
right now.

06:14.565 --> 06:15.608
Really, I can.

06:15.652 --> 06:17.173
We'd rather you didn't, ma'am.

06:17.217 --> 06:19.565
Not until we know
what color SUV she drives.

06:19.608 --> 06:20.434
Oh.

06:20.478 --> 06:22.086
Or how good a
shot she is.

06:22.130 --> 06:23.521
Oh.

06:23.565 --> 06:25.521
[makes gunshot noise,
chuckles]

06:25.565 --> 06:27.608
Really?

06:27.652 --> 06:31.695
CARA:
Jimmy's been defending
this country his whole life.

06:31.739 --> 06:33.695
For this to happen now,

06:33.739 --> 06:38.043
at home, in our little town...

06:38.086 --> 06:40.652
I'm sorry to have to
ask, Mrs. Barnsway,

06:40.695 --> 06:44.043
but we're gonna need to confirm
your whereabouts this morning.

06:44.086 --> 06:45.043
Me?

06:45.086 --> 06:47.695
You think I'd kill my husband?

06:47.739 --> 06:51.434
We have reports that an SUV
was observed leaving the scene.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.608
So just because I drive an SUV?

06:53.652 --> 06:57.130
Also, that the commander
did not die alone.

06:57.173 --> 06:58.695
There may have been

06:58.739 --> 07:01.826
a woman with him.

07:01.869 --> 07:03.086
Oh, my God.

07:03.130 --> 07:05.043
Of course.

07:05.086 --> 07:06.739
Is that what this is?

07:06.782 --> 07:09.130
Is-Is she dead, too?

07:09.173 --> 07:10.391
You know about her?

07:10.434 --> 07:12.478
She called before breakfast.

07:12.521 --> 07:14.173
Oh, God, what was her name?

07:14.217 --> 07:17.000
Um, she was an old friend
of Jimmy's.

07:17.043 --> 07:19.913
Some Navy connection overseas
from years ago.

07:19.956 --> 07:21.043
Did he say

07:21.086 --> 07:22.521
where she was calling from?

07:22.565 --> 07:24.304
I don't know.

07:24.347 --> 07:25.304
Not far.

07:25.347 --> 07:26.956
He was going to bring her home.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.000
She needed his help.

07:28.043 --> 07:29.130
Help with what?

07:29.173 --> 07:31.782
I doubt Jimmy even asked.

07:31.826 --> 07:35.782
He just... dropped everything
and ran out.

07:35.826 --> 07:38.130
One thing about my husband:

07:38.173 --> 07:42.782
he would, he would do
anything for a friend.

07:52.217 --> 07:54.043
Commander James Barnsway.

07:54.086 --> 07:57.000
A 14-year veteran, recently
assigned as a training officer

07:57.043 --> 07:59.739
at the Patuxent River
Naval Air Station.

07:59.782 --> 08:01.608
Previous deployments
are all over the globe:

08:01.652 --> 08:05.521
Iraq, Bahrain, Gitmo,
Sao Paolo, Naples.

08:05.565 --> 08:06.478
Naples?

08:06.521 --> 08:07.826
Yeah.

08:07.869 --> 08:09.652
As in Italy, Tony, not Florida.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.608
Navy has a base there, DiNozzo.

08:12.652 --> 08:13.913
Of course.

08:13.956 --> 08:16.826
Yeah, no, I just,
I-I thought I... misheard.

08:16.869 --> 08:18.652
Uh, call to the
commander's cell

08:18.695 --> 08:20.652
this morning
came from a burn phone.

08:20.695 --> 08:23.956
No way to trace it,
but I'm looking for...

08:24.000 --> 08:26.260
I'm looking for
where it was purchased.

08:26.304 --> 08:27.652
Enemies?None that we know of,

08:27.695 --> 08:29.521
but the commander
did have a reputation

08:29.565 --> 08:31.434
for being a hard-nosed
commanding officer.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.869
[cell phone ringing]

08:32.913 --> 08:34.739
Any complaints
filed against him?I'll find out.

08:34.782 --> 08:37.869
Abbs. Yeah, you were
my next stop, honest.

08:41.086 --> 08:43.608
So, Naples, huh?

08:43.652 --> 08:44.782
What about it?

08:44.826 --> 08:46.000
I hear the pizza's great.

08:46.043 --> 08:46.782
Tony.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.434
It was nothing, guys.

08:48.478 --> 08:49.478
Really.

08:49.521 --> 08:51.043
Nothing.

08:51.086 --> 08:52.565
Mm-hmm.

08:52.608 --> 08:53.652
Nothing.

08:53.695 --> 08:55.652
No telling markers,
no striations.

08:55.695 --> 08:57.521
They're both
nine-millimeter.

08:57.565 --> 08:59.217
A Glock, a
Beretta maybe.

08:59.260 --> 09:00.521
Silencer fits both.

09:00.565 --> 09:01.782
Which explains
the lack of a bang.

09:01.826 --> 09:03.304
Did you get
any prints off the brass?

09:03.347 --> 09:04.869
Nope.

09:04.913 --> 09:07.086
We're dealing with a really
careful killer here, Gibbs.

09:07.130 --> 09:10.086
There were no prints,
no residue, no nothing.

09:10.130 --> 09:13.000
Can't use nothing, Abbs.

09:13.043 --> 09:14.782
Well, then let's get
to the something.

09:14.826 --> 09:17.347
The memory on
the pickup's GPS was damaged

09:17.391 --> 09:18.652
during the collision,

09:18.695 --> 09:20.434
so it's displaying this

09:20.478 --> 09:22.521
crazy spaghetti pattern
at the moment.

09:22.565 --> 09:25.391
Mmm, spaghetti, meatballs.

09:25.434 --> 09:26.782
Garlic bread.

09:26.826 --> 09:27.695
Mmm, garlic bread.

09:27.739 --> 09:29.652
Abby.

09:29.695 --> 09:32.869
Sorry. I have to stop
working through my lunch.

09:32.913 --> 09:34.782
Anyways, I was able
to work backwards

09:34.826 --> 09:38.565
from where the pickup crashed,
try to retrace its steps

09:38.608 --> 09:41.869
or its spins, or whatever
tires do, and we get this.

09:42.782 --> 09:45.347
It's sort of like
a reverse Pac-Man

09:45.391 --> 09:47.956
or like working a maze
from the end.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.434
Go to where it starts.

09:51.956 --> 09:53.173
486 Overpass Lane.

09:53.217 --> 09:54.521
Also known as

09:54.565 --> 09:56.347
the Highway 12 Motor Lodge.

09:56.391 --> 09:57.652
It's just a few miles
out of town.

09:57.695 --> 09:58.913
That's not nothing.

09:58.956 --> 10:00.956
No, that's something.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.739
Just like you, Abbs.

10:10.173 --> 10:12.260
Whoever was in that room
got out of there in a hurry.

10:12.304 --> 10:13.956
Sorry I did not see her leave.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.869
I assure you I had no idea the
lady was in any kind of trouble.

10:17.913 --> 10:19.043
You have her credit card
on file?

10:19.086 --> 10:20.347
No, sir, she paid cash.

10:20.391 --> 10:21.652
Still, she must have shown you
some form of I.D.

10:21.695 --> 10:23.782
I'm embarrassed to say no.

10:23.826 --> 10:26.565
Uh, she was so
terribly pleasant.

10:26.608 --> 10:27.869
Like one of those

10:27.913 --> 10:29.956
Star Wars Jedi people.

10:30.000 --> 10:32.695
Uh, "You do not need
to see my I.D."

10:32.739 --> 10:33.956
[laughs]

10:35.695 --> 10:39.782
Um... it was late, I was tired.

10:39.826 --> 10:41.043
You too tired
to even get her name?

10:41.086 --> 10:43.260
Oh, no, no, no,
I made sure she signed in.

10:43.304 --> 10:45.260
Um...

10:45.304 --> 10:46.869
It's always good to know

10:46.913 --> 10:49.478
the name of whatever serial
killer you might be harboring.

10:49.521 --> 10:50.782
She's a serial killer?

10:50.826 --> 10:52.782
She is Belva Lockwood.

10:52.826 --> 10:56.434
And all she needed for a room
was cash, a name and a smile?

10:56.478 --> 10:59.173
To be honest, it was double
cash, three nights in advance.

10:59.217 --> 11:00.782
Times are hard.
DiNozzo.

11:00.826 --> 11:04.652
Belva Lockwood, the first female
to run for president. 1884.

11:04.695 --> 11:06.478
In what movie
did you learn that?

11:06.521 --> 11:07.608
I read a book once.

11:07.652 --> 11:08.826
That mean something to you?

11:08.869 --> 11:11.130
Well, it just sounds
like an alias.

11:11.173 --> 11:13.000
You have a security camera
around here somewhere?

11:14.478 --> 11:17.565
ABBY:
These are beyond
blurry, Gibbs.

11:17.608 --> 11:19.956
There's not much enhancing
I can do here, boss.

11:20.000 --> 11:21.826
Can you try streaming them
again?ZIVA: We are lucky

11:21.869 --> 11:23.608
to have streamed them
the first time, McGee.

11:23.652 --> 11:25.695
Equipment over here is not
exactly state of the art.

11:25.739 --> 11:27.347
But we do keep the sheets clean.

11:27.391 --> 11:28.434
ABBY:
I might have software

11:28.478 --> 11:30.043
in my lab
that can help us with this.

11:30.086 --> 11:31.521
Whatever you can do,
Abbs.

11:31.565 --> 11:33.434
ZIVA: If we saw this woman leave
with the commander...

11:33.478 --> 11:35.391
We should be able to see when
she came back to the hotel.

11:42.826 --> 11:43.565
Hold it.

11:43.608 --> 11:44.739
Time code--

11:44.782 --> 11:47.000
only half an hour ago.

11:48.173 --> 11:50.130
[computer chirps and trills]

11:55.086 --> 11:59.304
Then she leaves again...
five minutes later.

12:02.782 --> 12:04.956
Which way?

12:05.000 --> 12:07.608
Well, if I was looking
to get out of Dodge

12:07.652 --> 12:10.304
in a hurry
with no car...

12:12.608 --> 12:14.739
...I just might look to

12:14.782 --> 12:16.782
hitch the closest ride
I could find.

12:19.347 --> 12:20.826
[computer chirps and trills]

12:20.869 --> 12:22.521
McGEE:
Not bad.

12:22.565 --> 12:23.826
I know, right?

12:23.869 --> 12:26.478
It's like a computer
chemical peel.

12:26.521 --> 12:29.695
Let's buff out the blemishes
and smooth out the skin.

12:29.739 --> 12:31.478
It's like a regular
digital face-lift.

12:31.521 --> 12:32.869
Hmm.

12:34.695 --> 12:37.086
How do I look?

12:37.130 --> 12:39.217
Uncomfortable.

12:41.913 --> 12:43.565
Got anything?

12:43.608 --> 12:45.478
Manager says a woman
in a red jacket came in

12:45.521 --> 12:46.739
ten minutes ago
looking for a ride.

12:46.782 --> 12:49.000
And she just got one.
Tanker truck.

12:51.043 --> 12:53.739
There.

12:54.739 --> 12:56.086
Stop!

12:57.652 --> 12:58.826
NCIS!

13:00.173 --> 13:01.173
Get out of the truck.

13:02.869 --> 13:03.956
Hands where we can see them!

13:04.000 --> 13:06.782
Don't shoot!

13:06.826 --> 13:08.826
I just met the lady.

13:09.782 --> 13:12.217
Get out of the truck now!

13:12.260 --> 13:14.043
[whirring and trilling]

13:15.130 --> 13:17.086
Um...

13:17.130 --> 13:19.130
maybe you should give Gibbs
a call?

13:20.130 --> 13:22.173
Tell him we've got an I.D.

13:29.043 --> 13:30.956
[computer chirps]

13:31.000 --> 13:32.347
EJ.
EJ.

13:35.782 --> 13:36.739
Barrett?

13:36.782 --> 13:38.043
[sighs]

13:38.086 --> 13:39.086
Hi, guys.

13:39.130 --> 13:41.130
You're alive.

13:48.695 --> 13:50.565
Hungry, Barrett?

13:50.608 --> 13:51.869
Not anymore.

13:51.913 --> 13:53.869
Thanks.
So this has been
it for you?

13:53.913 --> 13:55.260
On the lam, running
town to town?

13:55.304 --> 13:57.260
Since they killed Cade, yeah.

13:57.304 --> 13:59.826
You left me lying
on the ground in an alleyway.

13:59.869 --> 14:01.260
I thought
you were dead, too, Tony.

14:01.304 --> 14:02.869
You thought?It was days before

14:02.913 --> 14:04.391
I found out you were okay.

14:04.434 --> 14:05.695
Much to my relief.

14:05.739 --> 14:07.000
Didn't stop you
from running, did it?

14:07.043 --> 14:09.478
I wasn't running, Tony.
I was on the run.

14:09.521 --> 14:11.217
Oh, there's a distinction.
"I wasn't running. I..."Hey, hey!

14:11.260 --> 14:12.130
I was on the run.

14:12.173 --> 14:13.478
You were
running.
Enough.

14:14.739 --> 14:16.652
You know that we were
there for you, right?

14:16.695 --> 14:18.565
I didn't know anything, Gibbs.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.739
Except that I needed answers
and couldn't count

14:20.782 --> 14:23.608
on anyone else
to give them to me.Not even us?

14:23.652 --> 14:25.043
Not without putting you
in danger again.

14:25.086 --> 14:26.652
So you were
protecting us?!

14:26.695 --> 14:27.782
And trying to find out

14:27.826 --> 14:29.173
who killed Cade
before they killed me.

14:29.217 --> 14:30.391
You were protecting yourself!

14:30.434 --> 14:31.652
Yes!
Hey, will you stop it?!

14:34.086 --> 14:35.130
You were wearing

14:35.173 --> 14:36.043
a vest that night, right?

14:36.086 --> 14:37.260
Same one I wore this morning.

14:37.304 --> 14:39.869
And lucky I did, too.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.608
Not so lucky for Barnsway.

14:46.739 --> 14:48.217
I never should have called him.

14:48.260 --> 14:50.043
Why did you?

14:50.086 --> 14:52.130
I'd been up in Jersey
a month or so

14:52.173 --> 14:54.173
before they got onto me.

14:54.217 --> 14:56.652
I guess
I'd been on my own so long...

14:56.695 --> 14:58.521
I don't know.
I needed a friend.

14:58.565 --> 14:59.652
GIBBS:
They?

14:59.695 --> 15:01.391
You keep saying "they," Barrett.

15:01.434 --> 15:03.739
Who's "they"?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.782
Who's this?

15:06.826 --> 15:08.260
He's the guy who killed Cade.

15:08.304 --> 15:10.043
Posed as FBI.
Name is Stratton.

15:10.086 --> 15:12.304
This isn't
who shot at me this morning.

15:12.347 --> 15:14.260
This... This isn't
who killed Jim.

15:14.304 --> 15:16.695
You sure?
I saw the shooter
up close, Tony.

15:16.739 --> 15:18.565
I know his face,
and that is not it.

15:18.608 --> 15:21.043
Take her down to Abby.

15:21.086 --> 15:21.652
What for?

15:21.695 --> 15:23.739
Go.

15:25.826 --> 15:28.913
ABBY:
And there she goes.

15:28.956 --> 15:30.347
We're running your shooter

15:30.391 --> 15:32.434
through every possible
database we have access to.

15:32.478 --> 15:33.739
Not a bad
rendering, Abby.

15:33.782 --> 15:35.826
Think we captured
his essence?We'll see

15:35.869 --> 15:38.217
if it captures him.
TONY:
So, you're absolutely

15:38.260 --> 15:39.869
positive that's your shooter,
huh?

15:39.913 --> 15:42.043
If I imagine him pointing a gun
in my face.

15:42.086 --> 15:43.695
Yeah, Tony,
close enough.

15:43.739 --> 15:45.304
Mm-hmm.
ABBY:
Um...

15:45.347 --> 15:47.695
this might
take a while.

15:47.739 --> 15:48.956
Nowhere else to be.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.434
ABBY:
Okeydokey, then.

15:50.478 --> 15:52.478
I'm just gonna, um...

15:52.521 --> 15:55.434
I'll be... in there...
if you need me.

16:00.695 --> 16:02.695
[computer chirps]

16:03.739 --> 16:05.913
So?

16:05.956 --> 16:08.000
So... I had
the craziest feeling

16:08.043 --> 16:11.043
when I saw your buddy Barnsway
had been stationed in Naples.

16:11.086 --> 16:13.000
'Cause you always
raved about Naples.

16:13.043 --> 16:14.521
Birthplace of the pizza.

16:14.565 --> 16:16.000
Wasn't until I saw

16:16.043 --> 16:18.782
that the first female
presidential candidate-- 1884--

16:18.826 --> 16:22.043
had been checked
into a roadside motel,

16:22.086 --> 16:25.043
that I got a gut feeling.

16:25.086 --> 16:26.565
You remembered Belva Lockwood?

16:26.608 --> 16:29.000
How could I forget?
That was some night.

16:29.043 --> 16:33.304
You going on and on about
how cool you thought Belva was.

16:33.347 --> 16:35.739
You know, I've noticed
something about you, EJ.

16:35.782 --> 16:38.434
You have a tendency
to disappear.

16:38.478 --> 16:40.913
Consequently, I spent a lot
of time looking for you.

16:40.956 --> 16:43.173
A lot... of time.

16:44.695 --> 16:47.260
So you didn't think
you could reach out?

16:47.304 --> 16:50.043
I was scared, Tony.

16:50.086 --> 16:52.478
Hell, I don't even know
why he's after me.

16:52.521 --> 16:54.043
It's not like
I could identify him.

16:54.086 --> 16:55.652
Hmm.

16:55.695 --> 16:57.043
[computer chirps and beeps]

16:57.086 --> 16:59.304
Looks like you just did.

17:00.565 --> 17:02.304
ZIVA:
With all due respect

17:02.347 --> 17:04.695
for what she has been through,
Tony, how could EJ think

17:04.739 --> 17:07.043
that living off the griddle
is a better option

17:07.086 --> 17:08.478
than having us protect her?

17:08.521 --> 17:10.043
That's living off the grid,
Ziva.

17:10.086 --> 17:11.391
Oh.
And, uh,

17:11.434 --> 17:12.608
Tony, you got to admit,

17:12.652 --> 17:13.869
the whole thing
is a little bit fishy.

17:13.913 --> 17:15.695
Spare me your conspiracy
theories, all right?

17:15.739 --> 17:17.608
You're preaching to the choir.

17:17.652 --> 17:21.695
We simply do not want
to see you get hurt.

17:22.913 --> 17:24.782
Again.

17:24.826 --> 17:26.217
I can handle myself.

17:26.260 --> 17:27.782
I'll be the judge of that.

17:27.826 --> 17:28.782
Go.

17:28.826 --> 17:30.173
Former Captain Marcellus Dane,

17:30.217 --> 17:31.217
41 years old,

17:31.260 --> 17:32.826
23 missions with
the SEALs in Iraq

17:32.869 --> 17:35.304
before being
dishonorably discharged

17:35.347 --> 17:37.608
at General Court-Martial in '05.

17:37.652 --> 17:39.739
Our records indicate
that it had something to do

17:39.782 --> 17:41.043
with accepting bribes
from private contractors.

17:41.086 --> 17:43.043
Which is no surprise,
since he was then hired

17:43.086 --> 17:45.173
by the same contractors
to be a weapons specialist.

17:45.217 --> 17:46.173
He's an expert
in handguns.

17:46.217 --> 17:47.739
Known to carry a Beretta M9,

17:47.782 --> 17:49.695
both on and off the battlefield.

17:49.739 --> 17:51.782
Same type of weapon
used on Barnsway.

17:51.826 --> 17:53.478
It is possible,
given the commander's travels,

17:53.521 --> 17:55.826
that he and Dane crossed paths
in Iraq at some point.

17:55.869 --> 17:57.478
And not in a very good way.

17:57.521 --> 18:00.652
Maybe Dane had his own reason
for going after the commander.

18:00.695 --> 18:03.347
No offense, Ziva. That is
a plausible theory, but that man

18:03.391 --> 18:04.565
was shooting at me.

18:04.608 --> 18:06.130
You have to take
my word for it.

18:06.173 --> 18:07.086
Why?

18:08.565 --> 18:09.739
Dane have
an address?

18:09.782 --> 18:11.173
Yeah. Last known is in Seattle,

18:11.217 --> 18:12.695
but he does have

18:12.739 --> 18:15.521
a cell phone that just
rebooted in downtown DC.

18:15.565 --> 18:18.478
Just pinged a signal from
an industrial apartment loft

18:18.521 --> 18:20.043
at Gentry
and 7th.
Ah. So much

18:20.086 --> 18:21.956
for our careful killer.
TONY:
Does seem a bit careless

18:22.000 --> 18:24.782
for a seasoned
paramilitary operative.

18:24.826 --> 18:26.000
Yeah, a little too careless.

18:26.043 --> 18:27.739
Let's be ready for anything.

18:27.782 --> 18:31.000
Let's? Barrett, let's?
Like you and us?

18:31.043 --> 18:32.739
Well, I can't stay
here, Gibbs.
Oh, sure you can.

18:32.782 --> 18:35.565
Watch this.
Keep her here.
Me?

18:35.608 --> 18:37.913
But I'm the one he's after.

18:37.956 --> 18:39.695
All the more reason not
to take a target along.

18:39.739 --> 18:41.391
Boss, there's no way.
I cannot...

18:41.434 --> 18:43.000
DiNozzo, make that two targets.

18:43.043 --> 18:44.652
If Stratton's
behind that guy,

18:44.695 --> 18:46.652
then both of you need
to sit tight.

18:55.086 --> 18:57.391
[loud, overlapping
crowd chatter]

18:57.434 --> 18:59.521
MAN:
Okay, okay, move
it on back, folks.

18:59.565 --> 19:00.782
There's nothing to see.

19:00.826 --> 19:02.217
[engine revving]

19:02.260 --> 19:04.260
[crowd chatter,
garbled radio transmission]

19:05.695 --> 19:07.173
NCIS.

19:07.217 --> 19:08.739
MAN:
Go on through.

19:08.782 --> 19:10.695
ZIVA:
People seem to die wherever
Marcellus Dane goes.

19:10.739 --> 19:12.782
I'll check the building.

19:12.826 --> 19:15.652
GIBBS:
Don't bother.

19:20.391 --> 19:22.391
He's right here.

19:23.826 --> 19:26.478
Cops say this happened
just a few minutes ago.

19:31.608 --> 19:33.739
Stabbed and then tossed.

19:33.782 --> 19:36.217
The phone signal.

19:36.260 --> 19:40.391
Whoever did this
wanted us to see it.

19:40.434 --> 19:42.869
I got a pretty
good idea who.

19:44.521 --> 19:46.826
[siren wailing]

20:06.043 --> 20:08.000
[piano playing]All right.

20:12.043 --> 20:13.260
Mr. Secretary.

20:13.304 --> 20:15.478
Special Agent Gibbs.

20:15.521 --> 20:18.043
Sorry to interrupt, sir.
You got a minute?

20:18.086 --> 20:19.739
We're just finishing up.
Can it wait?

20:19.782 --> 20:22.043
Or would you care
to join us?Neither, sir.

20:22.086 --> 20:23.434
Nothing personal.

20:24.478 --> 20:26.695
Excuse me,
gentlemen.

20:30.782 --> 20:32.826
Give us a minute?

20:36.739 --> 20:38.826
Need a favor,
Mr. Secretary.

20:38.869 --> 20:40.608
Oh, guess I better
listen then.

20:40.652 --> 20:43.217
I need you to talk
to Sean Latham.

20:43.260 --> 20:44.652
Why?

20:44.695 --> 20:47.478
Because we may have a bead
on Casey Stratton.

20:47.521 --> 20:50.695
Gibbs, the FBI takes
imposters very seriously.

20:50.739 --> 20:52.782
They have a task force
solely focused on...

20:52.826 --> 20:55.608
Not about the FBI, sir.

20:55.652 --> 20:57.608
Phantom Eight.

20:57.652 --> 20:59.478
Ring a bell?

20:59.521 --> 21:01.173
Yeah.

21:01.217 --> 21:03.869
It came up in discussions
when Agent DiNozzo was injured.

21:03.913 --> 21:07.130
Clandestine unit associated with
the Watcher Fleet. Classified.

21:07.173 --> 21:09.391
Does that mean that
Stratton is classified, too?

21:10.826 --> 21:13.347
You're saying
this is him?

21:13.391 --> 21:14.478
Stratton killed Cade, sir.

21:14.521 --> 21:16.869
He tried to kill
DiNozzo and Barrett.

21:16.913 --> 21:18.913
Agent Barrett is M.I.A.

21:18.956 --> 21:20.739
Not any longer.

21:20.782 --> 21:23.478
She's in a safe house with
DiNozzo on Old Rag Mountain.

21:23.521 --> 21:26.130
That's good news.

21:26.173 --> 21:27.521
You're the one who brought
Latham into this, sir.

21:27.565 --> 21:28.913
He saw

21:28.956 --> 21:30.086
the hospital surveillance.

21:30.130 --> 21:31.434
He should have
recognized Stratton.

21:31.478 --> 21:34.391
Maybe. Perhaps.

21:34.434 --> 21:36.434
But we don't even know if
they're in contact anymore.

21:36.478 --> 21:37.782
With all due respect, sir,

21:37.826 --> 21:40.565
this son of a bitch
had a locator chip in his arm.

21:42.043 --> 21:43.695
Latham knows how to find him.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.130
Latham needs to bring him in.

21:53.652 --> 21:55.521
TONY:
The game was great, Boss.

21:55.565 --> 21:56.739
Yeah.

21:56.782 --> 21:59.000
We won, of course.

21:59.043 --> 22:00.565
How'd yours go?

22:00.608 --> 22:02.391
Oh, it's not until
tomorrow, huh?

22:02.434 --> 22:04.826
Forgot about that.

22:06.956 --> 22:10.173
Okay, well, we'll let
you know how that goes.

22:10.217 --> 22:12.869
We're just gonna do a
little bit of tailgating.

22:12.913 --> 22:15.521
And maybe crack a cold one.

22:15.565 --> 22:17.869
Good luck tomorrow.

22:17.913 --> 22:19.521
Heard a lot of
code in my day.

22:19.565 --> 22:24.043
That, my friend, ranks
among some of the lamest.

22:24.086 --> 22:25.739
What's lame about a couple guys
talking sports?

22:25.782 --> 22:28.000
Besides, we don't know if these
phones have been compromised.

22:28.043 --> 22:30.652
At least now we know
that Jarvis is on board.

22:30.695 --> 22:34.043
When's the last time anyone
tidied up around here?

22:34.086 --> 22:37.086
Well, it's called a safe
house, not a tidy house.

22:39.043 --> 22:40.565
I know it's a far cry

22:40.608 --> 22:42.652
from the luxurious
truck stop motor lodge

22:42.695 --> 22:44.130
you've been staying in.

22:44.173 --> 22:46.913
At least I can't do
any more damage here.

22:46.956 --> 22:48.434
Not really where I
was going with it,

22:48.478 --> 22:50.347
but okay.

22:50.391 --> 22:52.043
Can you blame me for
feeling responsible?

22:52.086 --> 22:53.826
I mean,

22:53.869 --> 22:56.217
first Levin,
then Cade, then...

22:56.260 --> 22:58.652
Jimmy Barnsway.

22:58.695 --> 22:59.913
God, his poor wife

22:59.956 --> 23:01.739
must be heartbroken.

23:01.782 --> 23:03.565
Well, if it helps,
she said her husband

23:03.608 --> 23:05.826
would do anything for a friend.

23:09.434 --> 23:11.782
Doesn't help,

23:11.826 --> 23:13.739
but thanks anyway.

23:13.782 --> 23:16.478
You should cut yourself
some slack, EJ.

23:16.521 --> 23:19.130
What's the saying?

23:19.173 --> 23:21.956
That which does not kill us
makes us stronger.

23:22.000 --> 23:26.652
I think Nietzsche
said that.

23:26.695 --> 23:28.478
Important thing to remember
about Friedrich Nietzsche,

23:28.521 --> 23:30.739
of course, is that he died
in an insane asylum.

23:30.782 --> 23:34.000
This is probably not the best
way to start a pep talk, huh?

23:37.043 --> 23:41.304
Listen, we all have regrets.

23:41.347 --> 23:43.173
I've made mistakes.

23:43.217 --> 23:45.652
A couple of doozies.

23:45.695 --> 23:48.739
As for your mistakes...

24:06.521 --> 24:09.391
Sleep tight, Agent Barrett.

24:18.434 --> 24:20.304
Mr. Secretary.

24:20.347 --> 24:22.565
Sean, thanks for coming
on such short notice.

24:22.608 --> 24:25.521
I assumed we'd be meeting
in Director Vance's office.

24:25.565 --> 24:27.347
Yeah, there's more
than one SCIF, sir.

24:27.391 --> 24:29.130
Why don't you have a seat?

24:29.173 --> 24:30.608
Agent Gibbs.

24:30.652 --> 24:33.043
Guess that leaves
you in charge.

24:33.086 --> 24:34.391
Me? No.

24:34.434 --> 24:35.869
SECNAV can
hold his own.

24:35.913 --> 24:37.391
I don't doubt that.

24:37.434 --> 24:39.173
I know everything
there is to know

24:39.217 --> 24:42.695
about my team, sir. Do you?

24:44.130 --> 24:46.652
LATHAM:
Blast from the past.

24:46.695 --> 24:48.043
Where the hell'd you get it?

24:48.086 --> 24:49.521
I found it in a box.

24:49.565 --> 24:52.217
Mr. Secretary,
this is classified material.

24:52.260 --> 24:54.608
You know this guy?

24:57.130 --> 24:59.826
Pretty obvious I used to.

24:59.869 --> 25:01.043
You never
thought to mention

25:01.086 --> 25:02.478
knowing him a few months ago?I'm sorry,

25:02.521 --> 25:04.217
Mr. Secretary, is there
something I'm missing here?

25:04.260 --> 25:05.739
You said nothing
when Stratton

25:05.782 --> 25:08.043
came to the hospital looking
to gun down my best agent.

25:08.086 --> 25:09.521
Hold on, you think this is him?

25:09.565 --> 25:10.652
Are you saying it's not?Gentlemen,

25:10.695 --> 25:12.826
this is Captain Jonathan Cole.

25:12.869 --> 25:14.869
Former Army Green Beret.

25:14.913 --> 25:17.521
I recruited him into the
Phantom program in '03.

25:17.565 --> 25:19.304
Afraid you've got the wrong man.

25:19.347 --> 25:20.521
Wrong name, maybe.

25:20.565 --> 25:22.217
Right man.

25:22.260 --> 25:23.260
Is it possible, Sean?

25:23.304 --> 25:24.652
Absolutely not.

25:24.695 --> 25:26.043
Cole's a good man

25:26.086 --> 25:27.695
and a highly-trained operative.

25:27.739 --> 25:29.521
Trained to kill.

25:29.565 --> 25:31.173
He gunned down an NCIS agent;
now he's trying

25:31.217 --> 25:33.130
to get rid of everybody
who saw him do it.

25:33.173 --> 25:34.956
You know that for a fact?

25:35.000 --> 25:38.043
Agent DiNozzo made that ID under
physical and mental duress.

25:38.086 --> 25:40.043
You're not denying knowing
him, right, Sean?Of course not.

25:40.086 --> 25:43.260
Then let me talk to him.
Contact Cole, tell him we'd
like to arrange a meeting.

25:43.304 --> 25:46.173
Tell him the Secretary
of the Navy would like
a moment of his time.

25:46.217 --> 25:50.695
Look, if I could reach Cole,
what's our timetable?

25:50.739 --> 25:53.565
Soon.
Two of his targets

25:53.608 --> 25:55.043
are living in a safe house.

25:55.086 --> 25:57.608
It's less safe the longer
he's out there.

25:57.652 --> 26:00.565
Make it happen, Sean.

26:00.608 --> 26:02.130
Rise to the occasion.

26:02.173 --> 26:03.695
I'll do what I can.

26:18.913 --> 26:20.565
[gasps]

26:21.608 --> 26:22.869
[gasps]

26:25.652 --> 26:26.739
Uh... Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-ch!

26:28.043 --> 26:29.565
Room service. Easy, Lion.

26:29.608 --> 26:30.652
Tiger.

26:30.695 --> 26:33.130
Easy, Tiger.
You could have called.

26:33.173 --> 26:36.043
My cell phone does not like
these mountains, apparently.

26:37.652 --> 26:38.782
Why are you drooling?

26:40.695 --> 26:43.000
Is that what I hope it is?

26:43.043 --> 26:45.000
Coffee.

26:45.043 --> 26:47.000
And muffins with jam.

26:47.043 --> 26:49.739
You know, Ziva,

26:49.782 --> 26:52.739
everything Tony told me
about you when we first met--

26:52.782 --> 26:54.869
absolutely not true.
What?

26:54.913 --> 26:58.391
I never... said that
she didn't like coffee.

26:58.434 --> 27:00.043
How did everyone
sleep last night?

27:00.086 --> 27:02.000
I slept in the chair.
She slept on the couch.

27:02.043 --> 27:03.260
That's not what I was asking.

27:03.304 --> 27:07.434
Oh. Well, considering
that I slept vertically,

27:07.478 --> 27:09.956
I'm gonna see if
a little hot water

27:10.000 --> 27:11.043
can loosen up

27:11.086 --> 27:13.130
my lower extremities.

27:13.173 --> 27:14.608
Excuse me, ladies.

27:14.652 --> 27:16.173
If this goes on another night,

27:16.217 --> 27:18.043
I'll make sure
he takes the couch.

27:18.086 --> 27:19.652
Gibbs met with Latham,

27:19.695 --> 27:22.130
but don't plan on leaving here
anytime soon.

27:22.173 --> 27:24.130
[shower running]I have something
else for you.

27:24.173 --> 27:25.782
After you went missing,

27:25.826 --> 27:28.565
Gibbs had me access your secure
work e-mail for possible leaks.

27:28.608 --> 27:30.173
Should I prepare
to be embarrassed?

27:30.217 --> 27:31.391
Not at all.

27:31.434 --> 27:32.739
These are from
your mother.

27:32.782 --> 27:34.739
I was not sure if you...

27:34.782 --> 27:36.347
had reached out
to her recently.

27:36.391 --> 27:37.478
Not in months.

27:37.521 --> 27:39.695
I didn't want my parents
to be in danger.

27:40.869 --> 27:42.913
Thank you for this.

27:42.956 --> 27:44.478
Nothing you would not do for me,
I'm sure.

27:50.260 --> 27:53.521
Well, so much
for my big plans, huh?

27:53.565 --> 27:54.478
Hmm.

27:54.521 --> 27:57.086
What about your plans, Ziva?

27:57.130 --> 27:58.521
Beyond NCIS?

27:58.565 --> 28:00.434
A family?

28:00.478 --> 28:02.739
Um...

28:02.782 --> 28:05.956
maybe someday.

28:06.000 --> 28:08.434
Though that day seems
increasingly distant

28:08.478 --> 28:11.086
at the moment.

28:11.130 --> 28:12.652
To someday.

28:12.695 --> 28:14.260
Hmm?

28:14.304 --> 28:16.304
Hmm. Someday.

28:21.652 --> 28:23.652
[dog chuffs]

28:25.956 --> 28:28.695
Hey, boy. Hi.

28:28.739 --> 28:29.913
What's his name?

28:29.956 --> 28:31.521
Mr. Christian.

28:31.565 --> 28:36.130
Not a very trustworthy name
for man's best friend.

28:36.173 --> 28:38.000
You realize the position
you've put me in?

28:38.043 --> 28:40.434
They've made the
connection, Cole.

28:40.478 --> 28:43.043
They want me to set you up.

28:43.086 --> 28:46.304
So? Do it.

28:46.347 --> 28:48.347
It might actually
expedite matters.

28:48.391 --> 28:50.043
Or blow up in our faces.

28:50.086 --> 28:52.086
It's already
blown up in mine.

28:52.130 --> 28:53.434
I've got
nothing to lose.

28:53.478 --> 28:56.173
And therein lies
the problem.

28:56.217 --> 28:58.173
Our business affiliation,

28:58.217 --> 29:00.695
selling the microchips,
was very profitable.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.695
It's all behind us now.

29:02.739 --> 29:05.043
You know perfectly well
I can't proceed

29:05.086 --> 29:06.695
beyond the assignment
until it's complete.

29:06.739 --> 29:08.043
Drop the good-soldier crap.

29:08.086 --> 29:11.260
You're a turncoat now,
wanted by your own country.

29:11.304 --> 29:14.608
So just... forget
about the girl.

29:14.652 --> 29:16.608
I wish I could.

29:16.652 --> 29:18.565
Wish harder.

29:18.608 --> 29:21.000
I don't get
it, Cole.

29:21.043 --> 29:23.347
Success has made
you... what?

29:23.391 --> 29:27.956
Crazy, cocky...
or just sloppy?

29:28.000 --> 29:30.304
You didn't have to
kill the hit man.

29:30.347 --> 29:32.043
I assigned him a task,
and he failed.

29:32.086 --> 29:33.304
You're not getting Barrett.

29:33.347 --> 29:36.434

DiNozzo in a safe house.

29:38.652 --> 29:41.347
Place called Old
Rag Mountain.

29:41.391 --> 29:43.086
You sure?

29:43.130 --> 29:44.391
Per SECNAV.

29:44.434 --> 29:47.391
Even for a politician,
he talks too much.

29:49.043 --> 29:51.826
I'm giving you this
heads-up out of loyalty.

29:51.869 --> 29:54.826
And in return, you want me to
leave so you're not implicated.

29:54.869 --> 29:59.826
I want you to leave so neither
of us ends up in Leavenworth.

30:40.217 --> 30:41.434
Come on, boy.

30:41.478 --> 30:43.652
Come on, let's go. Easy.

30:53.043 --> 30:55.434
DUCKY:
Same technique as used on Dane

30:55.478 --> 30:57.347
before his fall from the window.

30:57.391 --> 30:59.000
Same knife?It would appear so.

30:59.043 --> 31:02.043
It was plunged in here,
and then twisted around.

31:02.086 --> 31:03.478
Perforated both lungs.

31:03.521 --> 31:06.173
This caused massive
internal bleeding.

31:06.217 --> 31:07.478
No way Latham here

31:07.521 --> 31:10.826
was gonna draw a breath,
much less call for help.

31:10.869 --> 31:12.565
Latham let him get close.
He trusted him.

31:12.608 --> 31:14.086
Well,
trust was his first mistake.

31:15.086 --> 31:16.391
That a microchip?

31:16.434 --> 31:19.000
Oh, yeah, but no
longer active,

31:19.043 --> 31:21.956
so you can add it
to the collection.

31:22.000 --> 31:24.086
It's interesting.

31:24.130 --> 31:25.521
Well,

31:25.565 --> 31:28.086

31:28.130 --> 31:29.913

31:29.956 --> 31:31.652

31:31.695 --> 31:34.173

31:34.217 --> 31:37.434

32:15.956 --> 32:18.521
All I wanted
for breakfast was the coffee.

32:18.565 --> 32:20.782
Now we're ready
for a fair fight.

32:20.826 --> 32:22.130
Always good to be prepared.

32:22.173 --> 32:23.913
I've been prepared for months.

32:23.956 --> 32:26.173
With Cole on the loose,
I think it's time

32:26.217 --> 32:28.391
to bring out some Connery,
and I'm paraphrasing.

32:28.434 --> 32:31.043

You never bring a
knife to a gunfight.

32:31.086 --> 32:32.043
Huh?

32:32.086 --> 32:33.869
James Bond?

32:35.869 --> 32:37.000
Untouchables,1987.

32:37.043 --> 32:40.695
Connery won an Academy
Award for that.

32:40.739 --> 32:43.173
I liked him in, uh, Xanadu.

33:00.782 --> 33:03.173
You know, one of these days,
I'd like to actually meet

33:03.217 --> 33:05.391
someone who appreciates
movies the way I do.

33:05.434 --> 33:07.608
Or at least appreciates
the way I appreciate them.

33:07.652 --> 33:10.043
She does, Tony.

33:10.086 --> 33:11.652
Who?

33:11.695 --> 33:12.652
Ziva.

33:17.217 --> 33:19.652
the Pirates of the Caribbean
is a cinema classic.

33:24.608 --> 33:26.695
Tony, I'm talking about you.

34:27.869 --> 34:29.391
Got the shot, take it!

34:55.173 --> 34:56.434
What's he got, a cannon?

34:56.478 --> 34:58.043
Sounds like a .50-caliber round.

34:58.086 --> 35:00.086
A gun that size
has limited accuracy.

35:00.130 --> 35:02.173
He seems pretty damn
accurate to me.

35:06.913 --> 35:08.043
All right, suppressive fire.

35:08.086 --> 35:10.086
Keep him moving
in the same direction.

How are you, DiNozzo?

36:38.217 --> 36:39.478
I'm good.

36:39.521 --> 36:41.521
So Latham took SECNAV's bait?

36:41.565 --> 36:42.565
Yeah.

36:42.608 --> 36:45.000
Yeah, gave up
Old Rag Mountain.

That's 20 miles east.

No.

to make before I head home.

Oh. Home, huh?
