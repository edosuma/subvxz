26:49.867 --> 26:51.733
TO BE SURE,

26:51.767 --> 26:53.733
BUT CERTAINLY NOT HARASSMENT.

26:53.767 --> 26:55.500
IT WAS BLATANT COERCION.

26:55.533 --> 26:56.500
AND YOU SAY THAT

26:56.533 --> 26:57.533
BECAUSE YOU KNOW
DYLAN VERY WELL?

26:57.567 --> 27:00.067
UH, YEAH, I DO.

27:00.067 --> 27:02.300
AND YOU KNOW SHE WOULD NEVER
FALL IN LOVE WITH A WOMAN.

27:02.333 --> 27:03.733
YOUR DAUGHTER GOT HER HOOKS
INTO DYLAN.

27:03.767 --> 27:05.333
DYLAN WAS AFRAID IF SHE
DIDN'T DO WHAT SHE WANTED,

27:05.367 --> 27:06.900
SHE WAS GOING TO
PULL HER FUNDING.

27:06.933 --> 27:08.500
YOU SAW THE TAPE, RIGHT?

27:08.533 --> 27:09.300
YES, I DID.

27:09.333 --> 27:11.400
I'M, FRANKLY, NOT CONVINCED.

27:11.433 --> 27:12.433
OH, YOU'RE NOT CONVINCED.

27:12.467 --> 27:13.733
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD,

27:13.767 --> 27:15.667
BECAUSE THIS TIME YOUR MONEY
AND YOUR PRIVILEGE...

27:15.700 --> 27:16.967
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE

27:17.067 --> 27:18.433
TO TWIST WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR ADVANTAGE, OKAY?

27:18.467 --> 27:19.800
GOODNESS, YOU'RE RESENTFUL.

27:19.833 --> 27:22.067
I THINK THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE,
CONSIDERING THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

27:22.067 --> 27:23.500
YES,

27:23.533 --> 27:25.933
BUT I THINK YOUR CLIENT'S
RESENTMENT TOWARD THE PEABODYS

27:25.967 --> 27:29.433
PREDATES THIS COMPLAINT.

27:29.467 --> 27:33.100
BOTH MR. WILSON
AND MS. MORELAND

27:33.133 --> 27:34.133
HAVE KNOWN ABOUT
THE PEABODY FOUNDATION

27:34.167 --> 27:35.700
FOR SEVERAL YEARS,
HAVEN'T YOU?

27:35.733 --> 27:38.133
EVERY FILMMAKER WORKING
OUTSIDE THE STUDIO SYSTEM

27:38.167 --> 27:39.800
KNOWS ABOUT
THE PEABODY FOUNDATION.

27:39.833 --> 27:40.967
SO, WHAT GOOD
GODDAMN DIFFERENCE

27:41.067 --> 27:42.300
DOES THAT MAKE?

27:42.333 --> 27:43.467
I ASK

27:43.500 --> 27:45.200
BECAUSE YOU APPLIED

27:45.233 --> 27:47.567
FOR A PEABODY FOUNDATION
GRANT FOR THE ARTS FIVE TIMES

27:47.600 --> 27:50.433
BETWEEN THE YEARS
2002 AND 2005.

27:50.467 --> 27:53.067
FIVE TIMES,

27:53.067 --> 27:55.633
AND YOU WERE TURNED DOWN
EVERY TIME, WEREN'T YOU?

27:55.667 --> 27:58.600
WELL, I GUESS THAT WE WEREN'T
THE FLAVOR OF THE WEEK.

27:58.633 --> 28:00.567
"RAMBLING, TRITE,
AND EXPLOITATIVE."

28:00.600 --> 28:01.800
I WOULD SAY NOT.

28:01.833 --> 28:03.967
YOU'VE GOT QUITE A TASTE
FOR REVENGE,

28:04.067 --> 28:05.700
HAVEN'T YOU, MR. WILSON?

28:05.733 --> 28:07.067
HERE YOU HAVE A CHANCE

28:07.067 --> 28:09.467
TO STICK IT
TO THE ESTABLISHMENT.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.167
I DON'T THINK YOU GAVE A FIG

28:11.200 --> 28:13.067
IF YOU HAD TO USE
YOUR GIRLFRIEND TO DO IT.

28:13.067 --> 28:15.133
YOU SAW A PEABODY
OFF-BALANCE,

28:15.167 --> 28:17.400
NEEDING SOMETHING,

28:17.433 --> 28:19.333
AND YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE HER
PAY FOR IT.

28:19.367 --> 28:20.700
MY CLIENTS
HAVE A ROCK-SOLID CASE

28:20.733 --> 28:23.400
AGAINST
MS. PEABODY.

28:27.933 --> 28:29.200
CAN I COME IN?

28:29.233 --> 28:32.833
DO WHAT YOU WANT.

28:45.267 --> 28:49.267
I'M SORRY.

28:49.300 --> 28:54.767
IT WAS SO STUPID,
AND IT'S NOT LIKE ME.

28:59.533 --> 29:02.333
CAN'T WE JUST
START AGAIN?

29:02.367 --> 29:06.067
CLEAN SLATE?

29:11.433 --> 29:13.367
[SNIFFLING]

29:18.733 --> 29:21.067
PLEASE?

29:32.333 --> 29:36.900
DO YOU FEEL
BETTER NOW?

29:36.933 --> 29:42.133
DO YOU FEEL GOOD
NOW THAT WE'RE EVEN?

29:42.167 --> 29:44.533
HMM?

30:02.433 --> 30:05.000
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT DANA A LOT LATELY.

30:05.033 --> 30:07.600
I MADE A REALLY
BIG MISTAKE WITH HER.

30:07.633 --> 30:09.600
I THREW SOMETHING REALLY,
REALLY SPECIAL AWAY.

30:09.633 --> 30:11.667
I DON'T REALLY THINK
THAT YOU THREW IT AWAY.

30:11.700 --> 30:12.533
I THINK--

30:12.567 --> 30:14.100
YES, I DID,
YOU KNOW.

30:14.133 --> 30:16.100
I MEAN, THINGS FALL APART
WHEN YOUR PARTNER SENSES

30:16.133 --> 30:17.300
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING BETTER.

30:17.333 --> 30:19.067
THINK ABOUT IT.

30:19.100 --> 30:20.933
I COULD HAVE BEEN
MRS. DANA FAIRBANKS

30:20.967 --> 30:22.267
RIGHT NOW.

30:22.300 --> 30:25.367
I WISH I COULD JUST
TURN BACK TIME

30:25.400 --> 30:28.500
AND DO IT
ALL OVER AGAIN.

30:28.533 --> 30:30.433
DO YOU STILL
TALK TO HER?

30:30.467 --> 30:32.167
YEAH, I DO.

30:32.200 --> 30:34.733
MM-HMM.

30:34.767 --> 30:37.400
I HEARD YOU HAD
A REALLY BAD BREAKUP.

30:37.433 --> 30:39.633
DON'T WORRY--

30:39.667 --> 30:41.000
IT'S NOT LIKE
I KNOW ANYTHING ELSE.

30:41.033 --> 30:42.167
I'VE BEEN PRETTY
OUT OF THE LOOP

30:42.200 --> 30:44.033
SINCE I'VE BEEN TRYING
TO HAVE A BABY.

30:45.700 --> 30:46.433
YOU'RE HAVING A BABY?

30:46.467 --> 30:47.933
MM-HMM.

30:47.967 --> 30:49.933
I DECIDED I WANTED SOMEONE
WHO'D ALWAYS BE WITH ME.

30:51.333 --> 30:52.667
I KNOW
THAT MAY SOUND

30:52.700 --> 30:54.467
LIKE NOT A VERY GOOD REASON
TO HAVE A BABY,

30:54.500 --> 30:56.767
BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
THERE ARE WORSE.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.300
YEAH.

31:00.333 --> 31:02.833
YUP.

31:09.467 --> 31:10.067
WOW...

31:10.100 --> 31:11.433
HUNGRY MUCH,

31:11.467 --> 31:13.100
MAX?

31:13.133 --> 31:17.133
UM, JENNY, TIM TELLS ME
THAT YOU'RE A WRITER.

31:17.167 --> 31:18.233
HOW'S THAT GOING?

31:18.267 --> 31:19.267
GOOD. FINE.

31:19.300 --> 31:20.767
SHE'S GETTING PUBLISHED.

31:20.800 --> 31:22.633
YOU ARE?

31:22.667 --> 31:24.967
OH, DON'T LOOK
SO SURPRISED, TIM.

31:25.067 --> 31:26.933
IT'S A MEMOIR.

31:26.967 --> 31:29.533
IT'S, LIKE, THINGS THAT HAVE
HAPPENED IN JENNY'S LIFE,

31:29.567 --> 31:31.100
AND...

31:31.133 --> 31:32.667
I'M PRETTY SURE YOU'RE IN IT.

31:32.700 --> 31:34.600
I AM?

31:34.633 --> 31:36.133
I DON'T KNOW--
YOU READ IT, YOU TELL ME

31:36.167 --> 31:38.067
WHAT YOU THINK.

31:38.100 --> 31:38.967
SO WHO'S
PUBLISHING IT?

31:39.067 --> 31:41.600
SIMON AND SCHUSTER.

31:41.633 --> 31:42.867
THAT'S GREAT.
THANK YOU.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.433
SO IT'S GOING
TO BE EVERYWHERE?

31:44.467 --> 31:45.867
YEAH, YEAH.

31:45.900 --> 31:47.500
THAT'S AMAZING.

31:47.533 --> 31:49.133
I KNEW YOU ALWAYS THOUGHT
I COULD DO IT.

31:50.167 --> 31:51.167
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING
TO SAY, JENNY?

31:51.200 --> 31:52.700
TIM...

31:52.733 --> 31:54.767
I KNOW YOU.

31:54.800 --> 31:56.333
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY
EVERYTHING OUT LOUD

31:56.367 --> 31:58.500
ALL THE TIME,
RIGHT?

31:58.533 --> 32:00.667
YOU DON'T KNOW ME.

32:05.233 --> 32:07.233
OH, WHAT, JENNY?

32:07.267 --> 32:09.533
WHAT PRIVATE THOUGHTS
ARE YOU HAVING?

32:09.567 --> 32:10.567
TIM...

32:10.600 --> 32:12.367
OH, MAYBE
YOU'RE RIGHT.

32:12.400 --> 32:15.200
MAYBE...

32:15.233 --> 32:16.833
I DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD DO IT.

32:16.867 --> 32:20.133
MAYBE I DIDN'T THINK YOU COULD
COMMIT TO ANYTHING LONG ENOUGH

32:20.167 --> 32:21.333
TO SEE IT THROUGH.

32:21.367 --> 32:22.533
OH, I COMMITTED.

32:22.567 --> 32:24.233
I BECAME
A SELF-MUTILATOR,

32:24.267 --> 32:26.367
WENT ON MEDICATION,

32:26.400 --> 32:27.700
DID A SHORT STINT

32:27.733 --> 32:29.333
IN A PSYCHIATRIC
HOSPITAL.

32:29.367 --> 32:30.733
I SPENT SIX MONTHS
WITH MY PARENTS

32:30.767 --> 32:33.567
IN SKOKIE...

32:33.600 --> 32:35.133
EVERYTHING THAT I KNOW
YOU'D WANT TO HAPPEN TO ME.

32:35.167 --> 32:38.400
I NEVER WANTED ANY OF THAT
FOR YOU, JENNY.

32:38.433 --> 32:40.133
[MAX]: DOES ANYONE
WANT ANYTHING ELSE?

32:40.167 --> 32:41.600
I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE YOU.

32:41.633 --> 32:43.400
WELL, SORRY. FOR YOU.

32:43.433 --> 32:45.167
ARE YOU GUYS
DRIVING,

32:45.200 --> 32:46.533
OR ARE YOU FLYING BACK?

32:48.067 --> 32:50.267
FLYING.

32:50.300 --> 32:52.567
YOU KNOW WHAT PISSES ME OFF?

32:52.600 --> 32:54.667
YOU ACTING LIKE SUCH A VICTIM,

32:54.700 --> 32:57.267
AND, NO, I'M NOT GOING
TO FORGIVE YOU.

32:57.300 --> 32:58.967
I'M NOT GOING
TO WISH YOU WELL.

32:59.067 --> 33:00.367
SORRY.

33:00.400 --> 33:01.467
YOU SHOULD HAVE LET ME GO.

33:01.500 --> 33:02.633
THAT WOULD
HAVE BEEN

33:02.667 --> 33:05.300
THE HONORABLE
THING TO DO.

33:05.333 --> 33:07.967
DON'T TALK TO ME
ABOUT HONORABLE, TIM.

33:08.067 --> 33:09.167
HEY, BECKY,
DID YOU KNOW

33:09.200 --> 33:12.167
THAT THE NIGHT TIM CAME
TO SAY GOODBYE TO ME

33:12.200 --> 33:16.467
HE GAVE ME A LITTLE
REVENGE FUCK?

33:16.500 --> 33:17.667
[BECKY]:
IT'S TIME TO GO.

33:17.700 --> 33:19.067
IS THAT HONORABLE, TIM?

33:24.267 --> 33:25.900
COME ON.

33:36.600 --> 33:40.200
I USED TO DRINK
GLASSES OF WATER,

33:40.233 --> 33:41.900
ONE AFTER ANOTHER,

33:41.933 --> 33:44.133
UNTIL I FELT MYSELF
CALMING DOWN.

33:44.167 --> 33:46.733
IT HAD TO BE COLD.

33:46.767 --> 33:48.233
IT COULDN'T BE
ROOM TEMPERATURE.

33:48.267 --> 33:49.267
I HAD TO FEEL

33:49.300 --> 33:52.067
AS IF IT WAS FREEZING
MY INSIDES,

33:52.067 --> 33:53.100
NUMBING ME.

33:55.067 --> 33:56.833
I DRIVE.

33:56.867 --> 33:58.500
I DRIVE TILL I GET
REALLY TIRED,

33:58.533 --> 33:59.667
AND MY MIND'S EMPTY,

33:59.700 --> 34:00.767
AND THEN I GO HOME

34:00.800 --> 34:02.067
AND KISS MY KIDS
GOOD NIGHT,

34:02.067 --> 34:05.367
AND I CAN ACTUALLY
LOOK AT MY WIFE AGAIN.

34:15.267 --> 34:17.633
UM...

34:17.667 --> 34:20.167
I DON'T KNOW.

34:20.200 --> 34:23.833
I GUESS I USED TO BURY MYSELF
IN A TASK.

34:23.867 --> 34:27.300
YOU KNOW, LIKE MY WORK
IN THE GALLERY.

34:27.333 --> 34:31.133
WHENEVER I FELT
THE WORLD WAS CLOSING IN ON ME,

34:31.167 --> 34:34.733
I WOULD JUST DIG MYSELF IN
SO DEEP

34:34.767 --> 34:38.067
THAT IT WOULDN'T TOUCH ME.

34:38.067 --> 34:40.433
BOMB SHELTER.

34:40.467 --> 34:42.867
YEAH.

34:42.900 --> 34:44.600
I WAS JUST RUNNING AWAY.

34:44.633 --> 34:47.133
DON'T DO THAT.

34:47.167 --> 34:48.500
YOU CAN'T
BLAME YOURSELF

34:48.533 --> 34:50.933
FOR EVERYTHING.

34:50.967 --> 34:53.800
NONE OF US DO MUCH
IN THIS WORLD ALONE

34:53.833 --> 34:55.833
EXCEPT DIE.

35:03.933 --> 35:05.533
HE'S SO GOOD WITH HER.

35:05.567 --> 35:07.533
WELL, HE'S SMITTEN.

35:07.567 --> 35:09.600
HE'S NOT THE ONLY ONE.

35:09.633 --> 35:10.600
OKAY, ALL RIGHT,
YOU GUYS,

35:10.633 --> 35:11.633
BEFORE YOU START.

35:11.667 --> 35:12.700
I'M JUST--

35:12.733 --> 35:13.767
I'M NOT GOING
TO TELL YOU ANYTHING,

35:13.800 --> 35:15.067
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT
TO JINX IT.

35:15.067 --> 35:16.067
OKAY.

35:16.067 --> 35:17.467
HOW ABOUT YOU, TINA?

35:17.500 --> 35:18.667
I'M WITH HENRY.

35:18.700 --> 35:19.700
I'M NOT GOING TO MESS
WITH A GOOD THING.

35:19.733 --> 35:21.233
ALL RIGHT,
WE UNDERSTAND.

35:21.267 --> 35:22.733
I THINK THEY'RE
WHIPPED, ACTUALLY.

35:22.767 --> 35:24.200
TOTALLY.

35:24.233 --> 35:25.667
I'M SORRY
FOR BOTHERING YOU,

35:25.700 --> 35:28.233
BUT YOU TWO HAVE
THE MOST GORGEOUS FAMILY.

35:28.267 --> 35:30.067

HAVE BEEN SITTING WATCHING YOU,

35:30.067 --> 35:33.233
AND THEY'RE SUCH
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN.

35:33.267 --> 35:34.433

35:39.833 --> 35:40.867
OH...

35:40.900 --> 35:43.067
AND WHO IS THIS
LITTLE DARLING?

35:43.067 --> 35:45.200
THIS IS ANGELICA.

35:45.233 --> 35:47.733
LUCKY LITTLE GIRL.

35:47.767 --> 35:49.367

35:49.400 --> 35:51.200

ARE ALSO ADOPTING.

35:53.667 --> 35:55.500
THEY HAVE
TWO OF THEIR OWN,

35:55.533 --> 35:57.167
BUT THERE ARE SO MANY
NEEDY CHILDREN,

35:57.200 --> 36:01.167
AND THEY HAVE
SO MUCH LOVE.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.567
AND A HUGE HOUSE.

36:02.600 --> 36:05.300
THAT THEY DO.

36:05.333 --> 36:07.267
WELL, WE'LL
LEAVE YOU TO IT.

36:13.200 --> 36:15.367
UH, JIMBO CALLED ME
ABOUT BASKETBALL NEXT WEEK,

36:15.400 --> 36:18.200
AND WE THOUGHT
WE COULD GET

36:18.233 --> 36:19.300
EIGHT GUYS
TOGETHER--

36:19.333 --> 36:20.300
THAT'S GREAT. GREAT.

36:20.333 --> 36:22.233
SOUNDS GOOD.

36:22.267 --> 36:23.333
THANK YOU.

36:29.200 --> 36:30.567
[CLEARS THROAT]

36:34.267 --> 36:38.333
TO WHAT DO I OWE THIS PLEASURE?

36:38.367 --> 36:40.433
WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:40.467 --> 36:42.067
I CALLED YOU.

36:42.067 --> 36:43.133
DIDN'T YOU GET
MY MESSAGE?

36:43.167 --> 36:45.933
YEAH, I FORGOT IT.

36:48.067 --> 36:49.133
DO YOU HAVE
ANY IDEA

36:49.167 --> 36:50.167
WHAT HAS
HAPPENED TO YOU

36:50.200 --> 36:51.300
IN THE LAST
TWO HOURS?

36:51.333 --> 36:52.867
YOU'VE HAD A CAR ACCIDENT.

36:52.900 --> 36:54.533
YOU'VE BEEN FUCKING
YOUR EX-GIRLFRIEND

36:54.567 --> 36:57.767
AFTER A FIVE-HOUR
BREAKFAST WITH HER.

36:57.800 --> 36:58.667
THEN YOU DECIDED,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?
