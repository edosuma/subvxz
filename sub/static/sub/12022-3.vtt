10:41.852 --> 10:44.821
Load's delivered, we got the

10:44.822 --> 10:47.223
Long as we got a happy customer,
next challenge is get the truck

10:47.257 --> 10:48.958
home in one piece.

10:49.026 --> 10:49.659
Yeah, yeah.

10:49.693 --> 10:51.594
Beautiful.

10:51.662 --> 10:53.663
So I see you put a load on.

10:53.697 --> 10:54.330
Yeah.

10:54.365 --> 10:55.465
You're a good man.

10:57.201 --> 11:01.404
Narrator: Alex's back-haul,
20,000 pounds of fish, is part

11:01.472 --> 11:05.508
of a long tradition
on the winter roads.

11:05.576 --> 11:09.312
Yeah, I'm getting a load
of fresh fish to take back.

11:09.380 --> 11:15.251
In the early 1960-- Right around
the '60s--'50s, '60s, a lot of

11:15.285 --> 11:18.020
these communities, uh,
were commercial fishing.

11:18.055 --> 11:21.224
And there was enough money in
fishing that a lot of the, uh,

11:21.258 --> 11:23.893
bush pilots, that's how they
bought their airplanes.

11:23.927 --> 11:28.431
They'd fly fishermen into the
lakes, and, uh, then they'd come

11:28.499 --> 11:31.234
back and pick up the boxed fish,
and fly the fish out, and that's

11:31.268 --> 11:32.969
how they paid for their plane.

11:33.036 --> 11:36.506
So as time went on, you put a
road in, it's a lot cheaper to

11:36.540 --> 11:42.078
haul fish out in a truck than it
is to haul it out with a plane.

11:42.079 --> 11:43.346
Hey, you too.

11:43.380 --> 11:45.314
Thank you.

11:45.349 --> 11:47.350
Thank you.

11:49.653 --> 11:52.522
Narrator: With a paying
back-haul behind him and the

11:52.556 --> 11:58.361
Canadian wilderness ahead,
Alex hits the road.

12:01.598 --> 12:03.599
We'll be going until
the engine quits.

12:03.634 --> 12:06.169
If there's a big clunk, bang,
bang, that's it, then we just

12:06.203 --> 12:09.238
get out, take our suitcases,
start hitchhiking.

12:09.273 --> 12:12.074
Narrator: Delivering this
load of fish will put another

12:12.109 --> 12:15.445
$1,500 in Alex's pocket.

12:15.479 --> 12:21.284
But on these roads, there's
no such thing as easy money.

12:21.318 --> 12:24.153
Well, this is
getting rougher here.

12:24.188 --> 12:27.557
Nobody's plowed it or
drug it or nothing.

12:27.624 --> 12:31.194
Driving on a road like this is
a lot more tiring than just

12:31.261 --> 12:34.430
driving down the highway.

12:34.465 --> 12:38.835
Because we got so many knobs and
rocks and potholes, and-- And

12:38.902 --> 12:44.207
hummocks and snow and no snow, and...
So as a person's going along,

12:44.274 --> 12:47.910
you're making split-second decisions,
especially getting to rough areas.

12:47.945 --> 12:50.213
'Cause you're going down the
road, you know, between-- You

12:50.280 --> 12:51.848
know, every bump you got
to make a decision.

12:51.882 --> 12:54.016
"Am I gonna go over that bump,
or am I gonna swing to the left

12:54.084 --> 12:56.986
and see if there's something
softer on that side, eh?"

12:57.020 --> 13:00.990
So it's a lot-- A lot more
tiring than just going down the

13:01.024 --> 13:04.527
highway, just staying in your
Lane at a certain speed.

13:09.633 --> 13:12.068
There's a hole right here.

13:12.102 --> 13:14.604
Water and ice around it.

13:14.638 --> 13:15.271
And flags.

13:15.305 --> 13:17.273
And then there's
a-- This vehicle.

13:17.341 --> 13:21.878
I wonder if it went through
this hole and smashed itself.

13:21.912 --> 13:23.079
That's not a real old one.

13:23.113 --> 13:24.981
I mean, it's fairly old.

13:25.015 --> 13:27.149
Look at the mud on it.

13:38.695 --> 13:41.030
It's an '03.

13:41.064 --> 13:44.667
Yeah, this truck was
buried in the mud.

13:49.306 --> 13:53.175
You know, this-- This truck was
stuck in that hole there, it

13:53.243 --> 13:55.411
might have been here
from last year.

13:55.445 --> 13:59.982
Somebody got it out of the
hole and moved it back here.

14:00.050 --> 14:03.152
It's called collateral damage.

14:03.186 --> 14:05.321
Driving down this road.

14:05.355 --> 14:08.457
We haven't seen it yet, but they
claim that there's some trucks,

14:08.525 --> 14:11.427
like, big trucks like ours, same
way, just sitting in the road,

14:11.495 --> 14:15.364
still here from last year.

14:15.399 --> 14:16.499
Making me nervous.

14:16.533 --> 14:19.101
I got so many things making me
nervous, I can't pick which one

14:19.136 --> 14:21.504
to be nervous--most
nervous about first.

14:21.572 --> 14:23.239
I got chains on.

14:23.307 --> 14:24.774
I got the...Locked up.

14:24.841 --> 14:26.042
Like, holy mackerel.

14:26.109 --> 14:27.877
What else am I gonna do?

14:27.911 --> 14:29.211
Wearing a condom.

14:29.246 --> 14:32.248
Like, I mean, how safe
do you want me to be?

14:32.316 --> 14:36.319
[Laughs]

14:36.386 --> 14:40.256
That's what makes life interesting, not
knowing what's gonna happen tomorrow.

14:40.324 --> 14:45.261
It's gonna--it's gonna blow or it's
gonna rain or it's gonna, you know.

14:45.329 --> 14:49.498
Whatever's gonna happen tomorrow,
we're gonna adjust to it.

14:49.533 --> 14:51.801
And if we get stuck in the
middle of the road, we have mud

14:51.835 --> 14:53.669
up to our ears, we're gonna go
home, and we're just gonna leave

14:53.704 --> 14:54.503
the truck sitting there.

14:54.538 --> 14:57.340
We'll come back next
winter and worry about it.

15:03.180 --> 15:10.019
Narrator: 2,600 miles to the
west, Dalton trainee Maya Sieber

15:10.087 --> 15:14.357
faces one last test before she
can get behind the wheel.

15:14.391 --> 15:15.558
Hey, I'm Trish.

15:15.592 --> 15:16.459
Nice to meet you.

15:17.628 --> 15:18.260
Okay.

15:18.295 --> 15:21.897
We'll go ahead and get started.

15:21.898 --> 15:24.166
Have you done a DOTUA.

15:24.201 --> 15:24.834
Before?

15:24.868 --> 15:25.468
Yes, I have.

15:25.535 --> 15:26.168
Okay.

15:26.203 --> 15:29.939
I need this cup filled at least halfway,
and I'll be right outside the door.

15:29.973 --> 15:32.842
All right.

15:32.909 --> 15:35.011
[Flatulence]

15:49.059 --> 15:50.926
I'm ready.

15:50.961 --> 15:54.130
Narrator: Maya will have to
wait for the results before she

15:54.164 --> 15:55.197
can hit the haul road.

15:55.198 --> 15:56.499
Hi. How are you?

15:56.533 --> 15:57.566
Hi. Are you Maya?

15:57.601 --> 15:58.300
Good. Yes.

15:58.335 --> 16:02.605
Narrator: Until then, she's
found another way to prepare.

16:02.606 --> 16:04.774
That's the funnest
videogame I've ever seen.

16:04.841 --> 16:07.877
Yeah, well, it's a lot
more than a videogame.

16:07.911 --> 16:09.512
It's just like a real truck.

16:09.546 --> 16:10.312
You just get in here.

16:10.380 --> 16:13.783
Narrator: Carlile trainer
John McCoy starts this New York

16:13.850 --> 16:17.319
city driver on a
virtual city street.

16:17.354 --> 16:17.953
Dog.

16:18.021 --> 16:20.222
Barking dog.

16:20.290 --> 16:21.791
Oh.

16:21.858 --> 16:23.793
Looks like he's about to...
Whoa.

16:23.827 --> 16:24.927
[Siren wails]

16:24.961 --> 16:26.495
I can tell you're
from New York.

16:26.563 --> 16:29.432
You were ready for that guy.

16:29.466 --> 16:30.966
Oh, my God.

16:31.034 --> 16:32.334
[Laughs]

16:32.369 --> 16:32.968
Are you serious?

16:33.036 --> 16:34.036
She popped out of nowhere.

16:34.071 --> 16:37.339
Yeah, she pops out of nowhere, and you
were right about three quarters of a

16:37.407 --> 16:38.040
second.

16:38.075 --> 16:39.975
Pretty darn good for
your first drive.

16:40.043 --> 16:43.479
Narrator: Having shown her
stuff on the city streets, it's

16:43.513 --> 16:45.715
time for the real challenge.

16:45.782 --> 16:46.582
[Simulator beeps]

16:46.616 --> 16:49.418
Put you on a little bit
of an ice road situation.

16:49.486 --> 16:50.419
Oh, boy.

16:50.487 --> 16:51.954
Yeah.

16:51.988 --> 16:54.256
It's-- It's unpaved.

16:54.291 --> 16:56.625
And you got to be ready for ice.

16:56.693 --> 17:01.497
Sometimes ice is really hard to see,
especially when... >> Oh, [Bleep] .

17:01.531 --> 17:02.264
Oh, my God.

17:02.332 --> 17:03.432
Oh, my God.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.166
Talk about slippery.

17:05.234 --> 17:07.069
Crash.

17:07.104 --> 17:11.272
Oh.

17:11.340 --> 17:13.142
Well, you know
where you are now?

17:13.175 --> 17:14.510
End of the exercise.

17:14.544 --> 17:17.179
That's crazy.

17:17.247 --> 17:17.980
You did it.

17:18.013 --> 17:19.448
That's, like, so realistic.

17:19.516 --> 17:20.148
Oh, my God.

17:20.183 --> 17:20.883
That-- That's tough.

17:20.916 --> 17:24.720
That was a-- That's quite a challenging road, so...
>> That is definitely

17:24.788 --> 17:25.554
challenging.

17:25.622 --> 17:26.955
That is slick.

17:26.990 --> 17:28.791
I learned you just
got to take it slow.

17:28.825 --> 17:29.725
Take it slow.

17:29.760 --> 17:30.526
Really slow.

17:30.560 --> 17:31.994
Expect the worst.

17:32.062 --> 17:35.097
It felt a little overwhelming
sitting in that chair.

17:35.132 --> 17:41.337
Even though it wasn't real, it was still...
This-- It is real what's gonna

17:41.371 --> 17:43.639
happen out there.

17:48.812 --> 17:55.384
Narrator: 2,600 miles east...
>> [Blows nose]

17:55.452 --> 18:00.923
Narrator: The rough winter road isn't
the only thing Rick is fighting today.

18:03.927 --> 18:06.529
And I'm kind of
dragging ass today.

18:06.563 --> 18:10.933
Yeah, I really got to kind
of stay focused, 'cause...

18:10.967 --> 18:15.070
This is the time when
you make a mistake.

18:15.105 --> 18:18.307
I got to get some rest and
get over this [Bleep] .

18:18.375 --> 18:20.843
Sounds like you got a
mouth full of [Bleep] .

18:20.877 --> 18:22.077
[Bleep], you.

18:22.112 --> 18:24.480
[Laughs]

18:24.548 --> 18:26.215
[Horn honks]

18:26.249 --> 18:30.553
Narrator: Rick is headed 155
miles north, to the town of

18:30.587 --> 18:37.193
Bloodvein, while Hugh will split
off east to little grand rapids.

18:37.227 --> 18:41.096
As they approach the turnout...
>> Okay, here's our sign.

18:41.131 --> 18:44.133
I guess we turn right for
little grand rapids.

18:44.201 --> 18:48.103
10-4.

18:48.138 --> 18:52.041
[Horn honks]

18:52.042 --> 18:56.478
Narrator: Rick follows Hugh
instead of continuing north.

19:05.088 --> 19:14.396
Five miles down the road...
Rick checks his hauling papers.

19:14.397 --> 19:16.699
Rick checks his hauling papers.
>> [Bleep], .

19:20.370 --> 19:21.904
For what?

19:25.475 --> 19:27.209
I knew where I was going.

19:27.277 --> 19:28.444
I got to go back.

19:28.478 --> 19:32.214
I got to find a spot
to turn around.

19:32.249 --> 19:33.015
Yeah, I do.

19:33.049 --> 19:34.917
I'm gonna have to
flip around here.

19:34.951 --> 19:36.752
He's not feeling
very good today.

19:36.820 --> 19:37.753
He's not paying attention.

19:37.821 --> 19:40.289
Should have looked at his load
sheet, see where he was going.

19:40.323 --> 19:42.291
[Horn honks]

20:07.884 --> 20:11.020
Hey, you know if there's a spot
to turn this thing around up there?

20:11.054 --> 20:13.022
I'm going to
Bloodvein with this.

20:13.056 --> 20:13.656
I took the wrong turn.

20:13.690 --> 20:14.957
I wasn't even watching.

20:14.991 --> 20:19.995
No? Okay thanks, man.

20:20.030 --> 20:25.200
Just asked him if there's a spot to
turn around, and he said, "nope."

20:25.235 --> 20:28.103
Narrator: On narrow roads
built to last less than three

20:28.171 --> 20:32.541
months, finding a spot to pull
a u-turn isn't gonna happen.

20:32.575 --> 20:35.277
These roads here, there's no
turn-around for a truck like

20:35.312 --> 20:40.849
this, so I got to back out...
At least an hour.

20:40.884 --> 20:43.385
Maybe two, to get out of here.

20:58.868 --> 21:02.404
[Horn honks]

21:02.439 --> 21:05.774
He followed me up, but now he's
got to back out a couple clicks.

21:05.842 --> 21:10.045
Yeah, he'll get pretty good at backing
up by the time he gets out of here.

21:20.824 --> 21:25.961
There's roads aren't that
wide, so it's gonna be a pain.

21:25.996 --> 21:28.697
It's hard to tell the
white from the white.

21:28.765 --> 21:31.100
You can't tell if it's a
snow bank or the road.

21:31.134 --> 21:34.503
And the last thing I want to do
is get in the soft snow on the

21:34.571 --> 21:38.607
sides here and get
myself [Bleep] stuck.

21:38.675 --> 21:43.579
Gonna be a long back-up.

21:43.613 --> 21:46.982
Narrator: Coming up,
Alex hits the ice.

21:47.050 --> 21:50.252
If we go too fast, a
wave will break the ice.

21:50.286 --> 21:52.955
Narrator: And Tony
relives a nightmare.

21:53.023 --> 21:53.789
I'm gonna get hurt.

21:53.857 --> 21:54.523
Here it comes.

21:54.591 --> 21:55.657
[Horn honks]

21:57.814 --> 22:04.453
Narrator: 200 miles up the Dalton...
Free of Dave Redmon,

22:04.487 --> 22:08.357
Tony Molesky is on his first
solo run of the season, hauling

22:08.424 --> 22:11.059
31 tons of diesel
to Prudhoe Bay.

22:11.094 --> 22:14.296
We're going across
the 72-mile flats.

22:14.364 --> 22:17.899
Probably about 20 miles
from surprise rise.

22:17.900 --> 22:22.104
What I'd like to do today is
just take a quick stop by the

22:22.171 --> 22:23.905
spot where I went off the road.

22:24.974 --> 22:27.275
I'd like to stop in there,
and get out, and walk around

22:27.310 --> 22:31.913
a little bit, and just kind of pick up
any leftover scraps and stuff, so...

22:31.948 --> 22:34.216
There'll be parts of my truck
probably there forever,

22:34.283 --> 22:36.752
but it'd make me feel better
to get every little piece out

22:36.786 --> 22:41.356
of there, if I can, and
maybe get this behind me.

22:41.391 --> 22:44.693
Narrator: Just two weeks ago,
a head-on collision in this very

22:44.727 --> 22:48.263
spot nearly ended Tony's life.

22:52.068 --> 22:52.868
Here we are.

22:52.902 --> 22:55.437
This is my crash site.

22:55.505 --> 22:56.371
That's where I went in.

22:56.439 --> 22:59.007
I stuffed it right
in right there.

22:59.041 --> 23:02.444
Wow.

23:06.115 --> 23:10.552
Looks like a few parts
of my Fender here.

23:10.620 --> 23:14.923
Little bits and pieces of
plastic that got left behind.

23:14.957 --> 23:19.628
Looks like a backup light
off my headache rack.

23:24.700 --> 23:28.003
Well, they call surprise rise
"surprise rise" for a reason.

23:28.037 --> 23:29.805
He had the advantage.

23:29.839 --> 23:31.973
He was on the top of the hill.

23:32.008 --> 23:35.444
I was coming up from the bottom
of the hill, so he really never

23:35.478 --> 23:39.848
knew I was coming.

23:39.882 --> 23:45.187
And he got on his brakes and locked
up his trailer without knowing it,

23:45.254 --> 23:47.923
and then slid his trailer
across the road into my Lane.

23:47.957 --> 23:48.557
[Horn honks]

23:48.591 --> 23:52.461
And at that point, I had no idea
his trailer was across the road,

23:52.495 --> 23:54.463
because he had all of his
lights on, blinding me.

23:54.530 --> 23:57.666
And when he finally got all
of his lights shut off,

23:57.700 --> 24:00.669
I got two seconds to see
this trailer coming at me.

24:00.703 --> 24:04.306
And what went through my head at
that point was, "I'm getting hurt.

24:04.340 --> 24:05.106
I'm gonna get hurt.

24:05.174 --> 24:05.941
"Here it comes."

24:05.975 --> 24:07.209
[Horn honks]

24:07.276 --> 24:09.478
And I just took a right
as hard as I could.

24:09.512 --> 24:12.047
I wasn't going fast enough
to get out of his way.

24:12.081 --> 24:15.550
[Crash]

24:15.585 --> 24:18.386
I absolutely know I was lucky.

24:18.421 --> 24:21.857
If that man wouldn't have shut
off his lights, it would've been

24:21.924 --> 24:25.861
a whole different ball game.

24:36.405 --> 24:39.774
We were on a dangerous road.

24:39.809 --> 24:44.880
[Groans]

24:44.947 --> 24:48.483
Next time I drive by, there
won't be any pieces or parts on

24:48.518 --> 24:52.587
the side of the road that I'm
looking at, saying "dang."

24:52.655 --> 24:59.060
I suppose this is
more like closure.

25:01.397 --> 25:03.565
Narrator: 2,600 miles east.

25:03.633 --> 25:11.006
That is-- I wasn't
even [Bleep] thinking.

25:11.040 --> 25:15.277
I'm kind of plugged up, and my head
feels like it's in a bit of a vice.

25:15.311 --> 25:19.848
So I'm just not fully on
my game today, that's all.

25:19.882 --> 25:27.656
Narrator: Rick's wrong turn has cost
him hours and potentially a paycheck.

25:27.690 --> 25:32.861
We're maybe about a quarter to halfway
into the back-up procedure here.

25:32.929 --> 25:36.231
Gotta constantly reposition.

25:36.265 --> 25:39.301
You're using your mirror,
so you can only see so far.

25:39.368 --> 25:41.336
It's hard to judge
what's up next.

25:41.370 --> 25:42.304
[Thud]

25:42.371 --> 25:44.940
Ooh. That's not good.

25:45.007 --> 25:46.408
[Bleep]

25:50.413 --> 25:53.381
Narrator: But just 30 miles away...
>> I guess Rick is behind

25:53.416 --> 25:54.849
the eight ball already.

25:54.884 --> 25:58.653
[Laughs]

25:58.721 --> 26:00.488
Did you just hear something?

26:00.556 --> 26:03.491
Narrator: The polar bear
has problems of his own.

26:03.559 --> 26:07.028
Could've swore [lndistinct].

26:13.035 --> 26:19.207
I lost all my air
pressure for some reason.

26:19.275 --> 26:23.545
Narrator: Without proper air pressure,
the truck's brakes will lock up...

26:23.579 --> 26:26.815
I haven't found anything yet.

26:26.849 --> 26:28.316
There's an air leak somewhere.

26:28.351 --> 26:33.688
Narrator: Leaving Hugh
stranded alone in the wilderness.

26:33.756 --> 26:38.860
Looks like I'm gonna
have to unhook the trailer.

26:44.200 --> 26:46.601
Come on, you [Bleep] .

26:46.636 --> 26:48.870
[Beeping]

26:48.938 --> 26:50.038
Hmm.

26:50.106 --> 26:52.741
Oh, yeah, she's building air
for some reason, though.

26:52.808 --> 26:56.745
I guess I had a valve that
got a chunk of ice in there.

26:56.812 --> 27:00.482
And now it's working again,
you dirty [Bleep] .

27:00.549 --> 27:06.354
After I unhooked the
trailer and everything.

27:06.389 --> 27:07.822
Change in the weather
all the time.

27:07.890 --> 27:14.896
Everything gets warm, and you're cold...
If it's on self-fix,

27:14.930 --> 27:17.999
that's great for me.

27:22.171 --> 27:25.173
Rock and roll.

27:25.207 --> 27:31.379
At least I didn't
have to fix anything.

27:31.414 --> 27:36.551
Narrator: 30 miles away...
>> Well, if I needed any honing

27:36.585 --> 27:42.323
on my back-up skills,
I just got it today.

27:58.040 --> 28:00.508
I can't believe I made the wrong
turn, but there again, I'm not

28:00.543 --> 28:07.415
with it today, so I'm not
paying proper attention.

28:07.483 --> 28:12.620
What a [Bleep] dumbass.

28:12.655 --> 28:17.025
Narrator: Finally...
>> I guess I should've turned

28:17.059 --> 28:19.394
left here instead of right.

28:19.428 --> 28:24.199
Narrator: Rick
reaches the turnoff.

28:24.266 --> 28:26.034
There's my left right there.

28:26.068 --> 28:28.036
Bloodvein.

28:28.104 --> 28:31.039
Narrator: He's headed in
the right direction, but time

28:31.107 --> 28:34.275
and patience are running short.

28:34.310 --> 28:36.377
That was [Bleep] exhausting.

28:41.450 --> 28:49.457
Narrator: As daylight fades...
Alex is headed South to

28:49.492 --> 28:52.660
winnipeg with a paying
back haul of fresh fish.

28:52.661 --> 29:00.835
We're just getting ready to go
onto the ice crossing on island lake.

29:04.807 --> 29:11.212
So we're gonna slow down, take
it easy, and onto the ice we go!

29:21.357 --> 29:28.930
They have larger, longer
ice crossings here.

29:28.964 --> 29:33.468
This crossing just opened in
the last couple of days.

29:33.502 --> 29:39.174
So I'm being fairly cautious
on keeping the speed down

29:39.208 --> 29:42.410
to about 10 miles an hour.

29:46.882 --> 29:52.120
Narrator: This 30-year veteran
knows that on the ice, speed kills.

29:52.188 --> 29:55.323
The ice is plastic, so it
bends underneath the truck,

29:55.357 --> 29:58.760
and as it bends, we push water in
front of us, which creates a wave.

29:58.828 --> 30:03.498
And if we go too fast and we hit
a shallow spot or hit the shore,

30:03.566 --> 30:07.035
or hit a weak place, the ice in
the wave will break the ice.

30:13.142 --> 30:16.244
I bought a new camera, and they
told me the camera's good--

30:16.312 --> 30:19.247
Good in water to 20 feet deep.

30:19.315 --> 30:21.583
I told her, "if I'm in 20 feet
of water, I'm not really gonna

30:21.650 --> 30:24.485
be worried about the camera."

30:24.520 --> 30:28.289
Thank you, lord.

30:28.290 --> 30:32.060
Narrator: Back on the Dalton,
Lisa Kelly is pushing hard to

30:32.127 --> 30:37.565
deliver r oversized car hauler...
>> It's snowing, and we got

30:37.600 --> 30:42.570
a little frost breeze going
on on my top-heavy load.

30:42.605 --> 30:48.576
Narrator: And erase the memory
of last season's biggest failure.

30:48.611 --> 30:53.481
Climbing up the
shelf right now.

30:53.549 --> 30:55.116
This is the rough
part of the road.

30:55.150 --> 31:00.455
This is the part I was
anticipating on being careful on.

31:00.489 --> 31:06.494
I am taking a little bit longer, but
I still wanna get it there on time.

31:06.562 --> 31:10.198
Narrator: But in the dead of
night, hours of intense focus

31:10.232 --> 31:13.401
begin to take their toll.

31:17.973 --> 31:23.411
Bam! It hit me like
a load of bricks.

31:27.316 --> 31:33.922
I am very tired, and we
are still a ways out.

31:50.005 --> 31:53.074
[Yawns]

32:03.309 --> 32:10.048
Narrator: 50 miles South of Prudhoe Bay...
Hall road veteran Lisa Kelly

32:10.083 --> 32:12.885
fights to redeem
last year's failure.

32:12.919 --> 32:14.786
[Yawns]

32:23.863 --> 32:29.067
The sandman's
laying it on heavy.

32:41.681 --> 32:43.448
I'm tired.

32:43.483 --> 32:47.152
[Yawns]

32:47.186 --> 32:49.788
Very tired.

32:49.856 --> 32:52.758
I'm gonna have a hard time.

33:07.840 --> 33:13.045
Narrator: Finally...
>> We're here!

33:13.112 --> 33:15.747
We just made it to Prudhoe Bay.

33:15.782 --> 33:19.384
Got this trailer up here.

33:19.419 --> 33:22.521
Narrator: Last year, an
oversized car hauler showed

33:22.588 --> 33:25.157
Lisa's lack of experience.

33:25.191 --> 33:31.596
Was on time within the hours,
and it's alive, and so am I.

33:31.631 --> 33:36.969
Narrator: Now, with her
biggest failure behind her,

33:37.036 --> 33:40.872
Lisa's got her eyes on even
greater challenges down the road.

33:40.907 --> 33:44.343
I'm glad I got straight up here
and was like, blah, okay, I'm done.

33:44.410 --> 33:48.981
I can do it. Next.

33:51.718 --> 33:58.523
Narrator: 250 miles South
at Coldfoot, Carlile trainer

33:58.558 --> 34:03.428
Phil Kromm is on his way to
retrieve an abandoned Dave Redmon.

34:03.496 --> 34:07.866
Tony left him here at Coldfoot
for me to come up and pick him up.

34:07.900 --> 34:12.704
This should be interesting,
to say the least.

34:12.739 --> 34:14.039
Hey, Dave.

34:14.040 --> 34:14.806
Phil.

34:14.873 --> 34:16.608
What's happening?

34:16.641 --> 34:17.909
Good to see you.

34:17.976 --> 34:19.277
You been waiting long?

34:21.014 --> 34:25.516
I heard there was a little
difference in personality.

34:25.551 --> 34:26.985
A little?

34:27.053 --> 34:29.254
[Chuckles]

34:29.288 --> 34:32.556
[Horn honking]

34:32.625 --> 34:36.261
Narrator: On their way back
to Fairbanks, Dave gets another

34:36.295 --> 34:37.896
shot in the driver's seat.

34:41.367 --> 34:45.837
Wanna make sure you announce yourself and...
>> Narrator: And another chance

34:45.905 --> 34:49.875
to take instruction.

34:49.909 --> 34:52.643
So was that okay there
in a put situation?

34:52.678 --> 34:55.847
You wanna be sure and, uh,
50 feet or so before the truck

34:55.915 --> 34:59.751
gets to you, just-- If you could throw
a glass of rocks, that would be good.

34:59.819 --> 35:03.422
Okay.

35:03.456 --> 35:10.495
Now you're going a little
faster than you want.

35:10.563 --> 35:13.031
Another thing is the
lean on the jig.

35:13.066 --> 35:15.867
All this company is, is train,
train, train, train, train.

35:15.902 --> 35:17.702
"We'll let you drive someday."

35:17.737 --> 35:22.507
Someday.

35:22.575 --> 35:25.143
I'm gonna tell you-- And I
told Tony when I got in his

35:25.211 --> 35:26.978
truck-- I'm the first guy that's
gonna tell you if your asses

35:27.046 --> 35:29.347
stink and you're too damn ugly.

35:29.382 --> 35:33.685
So is he, and that's where--
That's where the button "x"

35:33.719 --> 35:34.352
comes in.

35:34.387 --> 35:36.154
That's like two guys standing
in a puddle of gasoline,

35:36.189 --> 35:37.322
striking matches, see, you know.

35:37.356 --> 35:38.156
[Chuckles]

35:38.191 --> 35:39.791
Who can get their match
lit first, you know.

35:39.859 --> 35:41.626
Yeah, see who can get their
match lit first, you know.

35:41.694 --> 35:43.628
Yeah.

35:43.696 --> 35:47.165
I'm sure, you know, they're
waiting for me to get back to

35:47.233 --> 35:49.034
say, "well, what do you think?"

35:49.035 --> 35:55.173
Let me ask you your honest
opinion-- Do you think I'm a [Bleep] ?

35:55.241 --> 36:01.713
No, I don't, but you
haven't pissed me off yet.

36:01.781 --> 36:03.615
[Laughs]

36:07.687 --> 36:11.723
Narrator: 2600 miles east,
Alex is hauling 20,000 pounds

36:11.791 --> 36:15.360
of fresh fish back to winnipeg.

36:15.361 --> 36:20.332
Oh, boy.

36:20.366 --> 36:25.170
See, the last
guy went in there.

36:25.238 --> 36:30.008
Narrator: But the winter
roads aren't done with him yet.

36:30.042 --> 36:34.646
They call this
"underwear hill."

36:34.680 --> 36:37.649
One time this truck driver was
coming up here, and he had

36:37.683 --> 36:43.622
trouble on the hill and scared
himself so bad he pooped his pants.

36:43.656 --> 36:44.923
Finally he got to the
top of the hill.

36:44.991 --> 36:46.658
He took his underpants off
and hung 'em in the trees.

36:46.692 --> 36:49.027
Poopy underpants.

36:49.095 --> 36:53.198
And I suppose ever since that day,
other guys have been adding

36:53.266 --> 36:57.202
underpants to his collection.

36:57.236 --> 37:01.206
That's my story, and
I'm sticking to it.

37:06.212 --> 37:09.648
I broke the lens
out of my watch!

37:09.715 --> 37:11.483
Can't believe it.

37:11.551 --> 37:16.922
My blood pressure must've went up and
just blew the lens right out of it.

37:20.226 --> 37:22.661
So it's been kind of a--
Kind of an exciting evening!

37:22.728 --> 37:24.996
Blasted through that road there.

37:25.031 --> 37:32.470
Narrator: Finally...
Alex pulls his back haul into the truck yard.

37:32.505 --> 37:35.840
Oh, lordy lordy,
I'm glad to be here.

37:35.875 --> 37:41.479
Yeah, it's been an eventful day.

37:41.547 --> 37:47.953
In the name of the father, and the
son, and the holy spirit, amen.

37:47.987 --> 37:51.590
Narrator: Coming up...
Dave faces the music.

37:51.624 --> 37:53.225
How'd the trip go?

37:53.292 --> 37:55.961
Narrator: And Maya...
>> [Laughs]

37:55.995 --> 37:57.229
Narrator: Heats up.

37:57.296 --> 37:59.297
Now I'm not burning my ass.

37:59.332 --> 38:00.298
[Laughs]

38:05.698 --> 38:13.104
Narrator: 260 miles north
of winnipeg, Canada...

38:13.105 --> 38:14.706
I think I see
houses over there.

38:14.774 --> 38:16.508
That's gotta be
little grand rapids.

38:16.542 --> 38:18.343
I think I'm gonna go
straight into town here.

38:18.377 --> 38:20.145
That's where I gotta go.

38:20.213 --> 38:27.752
Narrator: Hugh rowland is about to
cash in on his second haul of the season.

38:27.787 --> 38:36.695
Gonna get 'em unloaded and get the
[Bleep] out of dodge and head on back.

38:36.729 --> 38:40.966
Narrator: 65 miles west...
[Horn honks]

38:41.033 --> 38:46.504
Rick finally rolls
into Bloodvein.

38:52.478 --> 38:54.512
I'm here. Yee-haw.

38:54.547 --> 38:59.517
Narrator: He's three hours
late and still pushing a fever.

38:59.552 --> 39:03.188
Everything I do today
feels ten times harder.

39:03.256 --> 39:07.959
Everything aches today.

39:07.994 --> 39:12.697
And everybody thinks it's just
jammin' gears and life is good.

39:12.732 --> 39:14.266
You get to see the country.

39:14.300 --> 39:19.371
Seem to forget that there's no one
you can call in sick to do your job.

39:19.438 --> 39:23.908
You gotta do it no matter what.

39:23.976 --> 39:25.076
I'm on my way.

39:25.111 --> 39:32.050
Narrator: Despite the struggle...
Both Rick and Hugh... >> She's a big one.

39:32.084 --> 39:35.153
Narrator: Have successfully
delivered their loads.

39:35.221 --> 39:37.155
We got 'em here,
safe and sound.

39:37.189 --> 39:41.526
We did what we were supposed
to do, and everybody's happy.

39:41.560 --> 39:45.030
[Horn honks]

39:45.064 --> 39:48.066
That's two loads
in the bank, anyway.

39:48.100 --> 39:51.536
[Man speaks over car radio]

39:51.570 --> 39:52.871
Dash for the cash.

39:52.905 --> 39:55.140
[Speaks indistinctly]

39:55.174 --> 39:59.244
Narrator: As Rick and Hugh
turn and burn, their successful

39:59.312 --> 40:02.247
deliveries bring them
dead even with Alex.

40:02.315 --> 40:06.618
But on the Dalton, Lisa stays at
the front of the pack with three

40:06.652 --> 40:12.891
loads, while Dave and Maya
have yet to get in the game.

40:12.958 --> 40:17.896
At the Carlile yard...
[Horn honks]

40:17.930 --> 40:23.435
Dave's made it back to Fairbanks
with an empty fuel tanker.

40:28.274 --> 40:31.876
I don't wanna be out in the
yard without safety equipment.

40:31.911 --> 40:34.179
That's right.
Three points contact on your way down too.

40:34.246 --> 40:35.547
Oh, yeah.

40:35.581 --> 40:37.382
That means head, ass, and knees.

40:37.416 --> 40:38.550
[Laughs]

40:38.584 --> 40:42.287
Narrator: After a thumbs
down from Tony, Carlile boss

40:42.321 --> 40:46.624
Lane Keator is looking
for a second opinion.

40:46.659 --> 40:47.625
What's happening?

40:47.660 --> 40:48.626
Not much. How's it going?

40:48.661 --> 40:49.627
Both: Good.

40:49.662 --> 40:52.097
How'd the trip go?

40:52.131 --> 40:57.302
He drove daytime, nighttime,
loaded, empty a little bit.

40:57.370 --> 40:58.169
Worked on a few things.

40:58.204 --> 41:01.473
He made some immediate
corrections.

41:01.507 --> 41:03.341
After that, it was not an issue.

41:03.376 --> 41:04.642
Okay.

41:04.677 --> 41:07.579
We'll get set up and sit down and
visit a little bit... >> Okay.

41:07.613 --> 41:13.551
And come to a conclusion on
what we're gonna do going forward.

41:13.586 --> 41:17.622
Narrator: Lane will weigh Tony and
Phil's assessment of Dave's abilities.

41:17.656 --> 41:22.293
For now, the Alabama
slammer will have to wait.

41:22.328 --> 41:24.662
I don't wanna be a
rookie again, you know.

41:24.730 --> 41:29.667
It's like being the new kid in school,
and it's just-- It's a pain in the ass.

41:29.702 --> 41:31.202
It really is.

41:31.270 --> 41:34.372
You know you can do the job, I
got a resume that says I can

41:34.407 --> 41:40.178
do the job, but nobody's gonna let me do the job...
Because they don't know me.

41:40.212 --> 41:41.279
Both: All right.

41:41.313 --> 41:41.946
Appreciate it.

41:42.014 --> 41:42.647
Thanks, Dave.

41:42.681 --> 41:43.314
We'll see you soon.

41:43.349 --> 41:44.015
All right, thanks.

41:44.049 --> 41:46.684
You bet.

41:51.824 --> 41:53.591
I can't wait to get on that
road, and make some money,

41:53.659 --> 41:56.694
and be done with this [Bleep] .

41:56.729 --> 42:03.468
Narrator: As one rookie gets out of
hot water, another is just gettin' in.

42:03.502 --> 42:07.605
And tomorrow she'll begin
training to drive the hall road.

42:07.673 --> 42:11.776
I'm here at Chena Springs, and I'm
here to relax in the hot Springs.

42:11.844 --> 42:15.146
Narrator: Fairbanks'
famous Chena hot Springs are

42:15.181 --> 42:19.150
the perfect chance to unwind
before Maya gets down to

42:19.185 --> 42:20.952
business behind the wheel.

42:20.986 --> 42:24.222
It is extremely cold out
here, but the water is, like,

42:24.256 --> 42:28.526
very warm, like
over 100 degrees.

42:28.594 --> 42:29.694
Oh, my God.

42:29.762 --> 42:31.863
[Giggles]

42:31.897 --> 42:33.698
Is this natural?

42:33.766 --> 42:37.535
Oh, it's so cold,
but it's so hot!

42:37.603 --> 42:41.339
I have goosebumps on
top of goosebumps.

42:41.373 --> 42:43.508
Oh, my God.

42:43.542 --> 42:46.344
Ah. [Giggles]

42:46.378 --> 42:49.347
Narrator: Her drug test has
come back clean, and tomorrow

42:49.381 --> 42:52.884
she'll begin training
to drive the hall road.

42:52.952 --> 42:57.088
Being a truck driver is
extremely stressful, and, um,

42:57.122 --> 43:00.792
it's just important to try and
find ways to relieve stress.

43:00.826 --> 43:03.261
This is definitely the
stress relief that I needed.

43:03.295 --> 43:06.831
I'm enjoying today, but I'm
really, really ready to do my

43:06.899 --> 43:08.800
job and get behind the wheel.

43:08.868 --> 43:12.003
This is my life, my
livelihood, and my passion.

43:12.037 --> 43:17.976
It's great to relax, but I
can't wait to get truckin'.

43:23.382 --> 43:26.518
Narrator: Next week <i>on
ice road truckers...</i>

43:26.552 --> 43:28.620
<i>>> Eh, I'm not a total [Bleep] .</i>

43:28.687 --> 43:31.556
<i>>> Narrator: Two rookie
drivers hit the hall road.</i>

43:31.590 --> 43:33.157
<i>>> Make sure you
stay to your side.</i>

43:33.192 --> 43:34.826
<i>>> Narrator: And the
road hits back.</i>

43:34.894 --> 43:35.894
<i>>> Big truck.</i>

43:35.928 --> 43:38.630
<i>[Horn honks]</i>

43:38.664 --> 43:43.535
<i>>> Narrator: And in Canada...
>> There it goes!</i>

43:43.569 --> 43:45.970
<i>>> Narrator: The biggest
loads of the season...</i>

43:46.005 --> 43:47.539
<i>>> Everybody through?</i>

43:47.606 --> 43:48.740
<i>[Clanking]</i>

43:48.807 --> 43:54.112
<i>>> Narrator: Push Hugh and
Rick to the breaking point.</i>

43:54.179 --> 43:55.446
<i>>> I can't even steer this [Bleep] .</i>
