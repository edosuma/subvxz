00:24.687 --> 00:26.139
No distractions.
No histrionics.

00:27.316 --> 00:28.616
Everyone
on the ground!

00:28.684 --> 00:31.353
You stay with him
until I reach the teller window.

00:32.688 --> 00:35.306
He'll take care of the cameras
and the lights.

00:36.509 --> 00:38.593
Me and the others
will control the situation

00:38.661 --> 00:40.245
while you
open the safe.

00:41.414 --> 00:43.148
We're in. We're out.

00:44.734 --> 00:47.052
I need a gun.

00:48.404 --> 00:50.938
Writin' a book
like this is like--

00:50.990 --> 00:53.041
well, it's not easy.

00:53.108 --> 00:57.212
You know, it's like
a high-wire act, really.

00:58.947 --> 01:02.467
I mean, especially since
the whole thing

01:02.551 --> 01:04.135
hinges on
a science which--

01:04.220 --> 01:08.740
take my word for it--
in the wrong hands, would be a gaping yawn.

01:08.808 --> 01:12.811
I mean, you can't make
sense of what you see, you see?

01:14.563 --> 01:17.515
Human face is like
a puzzle. It--

01:17.600 --> 01:20.652
you gotta know
what to look for.

01:20.736 --> 01:22.520
Um...

01:22.605 --> 01:23.822
This book,
it's just not--

01:23.906 --> 01:26.574
it's not gonna write itself,
you know what I mean?

01:26.642 --> 01:29.694
Are you saying
your science is like art?

01:29.779 --> 01:31.863
Small "a."

01:31.947 --> 01:34.749
Uh, he's selfish,
some say brilliant,

01:34.817 --> 01:37.202
but a bully.

01:37.286 --> 01:39.037
He's dangerous.
He's a narcissist,

01:39.121 --> 01:41.589
and, uh, I can see
that you are--

01:41.657 --> 01:45.877
you're wondering how it is
I've managed to work for him this long,

01:45.961 --> 01:49.180
and, uh, you know,
the truth is I don't know.

01:49.265 --> 01:53.852
I don't know, but the point
is that I'm here now.

01:53.936 --> 01:56.805
Dr. Lightman, let me
be completely clear.

01:56.856 --> 01:58.373
You look like
you could use a drink.

01:58.441 --> 02:00.225
Beg your pardon?

02:00.309 --> 02:02.577
Glass of water just
to clear the throat, you know.

02:02.645 --> 02:03.812
Back in a jiffy.

02:08.651 --> 02:11.736
Torres,
in 2 minutes, right,

02:11.821 --> 02:14.038
I want you to come
in my office

02:14.123 --> 02:15.874
and tell me
I'm needed urgently.

02:15.958 --> 02:16.858
Needed urgently where?

02:16.909 --> 02:18.993
I don't know.
I don't care, all right?

02:19.044 --> 02:20.495
But make it good,
all right?

02:20.546 --> 02:22.029
Ok. Yeah.
No problem.

02:22.081 --> 02:24.165
Uh, why?

02:24.216 --> 02:26.384
Is this
the Torres group already,

02:26.469 --> 02:28.803
or is it still
the Lightman group?

02:29.855 --> 02:31.773
Right.

02:36.645 --> 02:39.314
It's tap water.

02:39.381 --> 02:41.015
You know, hope
that's all right.

02:41.066 --> 02:43.885
Save the planet.
All that. You know what I mean?

02:48.007 --> 02:50.842
My client,
DeWitt and Jones publishing,

02:50.926 --> 02:52.177
is tired of waiting

02:52.261 --> 02:55.763
for the book they contracted you
to write over 2 years ago.

02:55.831 --> 02:58.733
They now need evidence that
you're working in good faith

02:58.801 --> 03:02.387
commensurate with
the generous advance they paid.

03:02.471 --> 03:04.689
In other words,
deliver the book

03:04.773 --> 03:06.207
before the end
of the quarter,

03:06.275 --> 03:08.893
or next time we see each other
will be in court,

03:08.978 --> 03:12.530
and you'll be facing charges of misrepresentation
and, uh, fraud.

03:12.615 --> 03:14.732
End of the quarter?

03:14.817 --> 03:18.486
I mean, what do they
think I'm writin' here, a check?

03:18.537 --> 03:20.538
That'd be
an elegant way out,

03:20.623 --> 03:23.575
save the inevitable lien
on your assets.

03:23.659 --> 03:27.629
My advice to you--
write the damn book.

03:29.197 --> 03:30.582
It's just tap water!

03:30.666 --> 03:32.166
It's not poison!

03:34.169 --> 03:35.336
Who was that?

03:35.387 --> 03:39.057
That was someone
with more contempt for me

03:39.141 --> 03:41.593
than they have for the planet,
which is saying something.

03:41.677 --> 03:44.145
She's a 24-karat pit bull,
that one.

03:44.212 --> 03:45.613
But then you already
knew that, didn't you?

03:45.681 --> 03:47.232
Thanks for the heads-up.

03:47.299 --> 03:49.817
Have you written
even one word of this book?

03:49.885 --> 03:52.854
Which, by the way, you failed
to ever tell me about.

03:52.905 --> 03:53.905
Well, the hard part...

03:53.989 --> 03:55.440
Thank you for calling
district bank.

03:55.524 --> 03:56.941
Is in here.
Rest is easy.

03:57.026 --> 03:59.060
Let's hope so,
for all our sakes.

03:59.111 --> 04:00.061
Meaning?

04:00.112 --> 04:01.946
This is a business.
You may not care

04:02.031 --> 04:03.698
about your responsibilities
to the rest of us,

04:03.749 --> 04:06.284
but please stop acting like
you're not even aware of them.

04:06.368 --> 04:08.202
Dr. Lightman, you're needed
in the lab urgently.

04:08.254 --> 04:09.754
You're late.

04:09.838 --> 04:10.905
For corporate accounts,
press 2.

04:10.973 --> 04:12.457
And you're leaking.

04:14.093 --> 04:16.793
Your approximate
wait time is 11 minutes.

04:16.879 --> 04:18.346
Ah, bollocks.

04:20.815 --> 04:24.085
I need access
to my account, please.

04:25.020 --> 04:26.420
Yeah.

04:42.788 --> 04:45.106
You see that, right?
You see that?

04:46.058 --> 04:47.659
They always look
at me like that.

04:47.743 --> 04:51.129
I mean, do I look like
a criminal to you?

04:51.213 --> 04:52.213
Don't answer that.

04:52.280 --> 04:53.447
Cal Lightman.

04:53.499 --> 04:55.466
Hi.
Pleased to meet you, too.

04:55.551 --> 04:57.135
Now, ay attention.
Keep up.

04:57.219 --> 04:58.619
You see these two?

04:58.671 --> 05:00.004
They're on the rocks.

05:00.089 --> 05:03.124
She's had it up to here with him,
and, uh, he blames her,

05:03.175 --> 05:05.626
so now it's all
down to the money.

05:07.462 --> 05:10.131
And see this one
over here?

05:10.182 --> 05:12.600
That's your average
honor student, that is.

05:12.651 --> 05:14.185
Or meth head.

05:14.269 --> 05:16.137
Possible to be both.

05:16.188 --> 05:17.805
But I digress.

05:19.158 --> 05:21.109
I didn't catch your name.

05:21.160 --> 05:25.663
Well, that's because you haven't
given me a chance.

05:29.368 --> 05:31.652
How you doin'?
You all right?

05:32.654 --> 05:33.588
Yeah.

05:33.655 --> 05:36.124
So are you looking
for someone, or, uh,

05:36.175 --> 05:38.509
you know, you just
casin' the joint?

05:38.594 --> 05:40.094
What?

05:40.162 --> 05:41.713
No, it's all right.

05:41.797 --> 05:45.933
Secret's safe with me,
as long as you cut me in.

05:47.686 --> 05:51.222
So, uh, when you
gonna do it, then?

05:51.306 --> 05:52.974
Do what?

05:53.025 --> 05:55.727
Rob the bank.

06:34.183 --> 06:36.350
What?! Is it
something I said?!

06:37.436 --> 06:39.103
Thank you.

06:44.610 --> 06:47.394
Oh, that's interesting.

06:53.568 --> 06:55.453
How much time'd you do?

06:55.537 --> 06:57.321
Listen, Buddy,
whatever you're sellin',

06:57.389 --> 06:59.123
I'm not buyin',
all right?

06:59.208 --> 07:01.426
State or federal?

07:02.294 --> 07:04.295
How do you know I was in?

07:04.379 --> 07:05.630
My money's on state.

07:05.714 --> 07:08.332
When'd you get out?
Was it days ago?

07:08.417 --> 07:10.251
Weeks?

07:10.302 --> 07:13.971
I've been in exactly
the same place as you are now.

07:14.056 --> 07:15.456
I doubt that.

07:24.650 --> 07:27.301
In answer
to your question,

07:27.352 --> 07:28.603
I read faces.

07:28.654 --> 07:30.071
I didn't ask you anything.

07:30.138 --> 07:32.106
Yeah, you did.
Not only that,

07:32.157 --> 07:33.691
I used to work
in that bank,

07:33.776 --> 07:37.411
so I've got
the added edge.

07:38.447 --> 07:40.031
You worked in that bank?

07:40.115 --> 07:42.450
Yep, corporate office
downtown. Why?

07:42.501 --> 07:44.352
Nothin'.

07:44.419 --> 07:46.370
You sure about that,
are you?

07:46.455 --> 07:49.090
What's my face sayin'
right now?

07:51.210 --> 07:56.163
You wanna hit that bank
so much, it scares you.

07:56.215 --> 08:00.551
I wanna hit that bank
as bad as you do,  worse, probably.

08:00.636 --> 08:03.304
Could I just eat
my breakfast in peace?

08:03.355 --> 08:04.672
Good luck.

08:04.723 --> 08:07.358
You're gonna need it.

08:18.654 --> 08:20.037
Mr. Lightman.

08:20.122 --> 08:21.489
Let me guess.

08:21.540 --> 08:23.074
Bad news
about my accounts,

08:23.158 --> 08:25.326
which you're
secretly enjoying.

08:25.377 --> 08:26.661
Sorry to keep you.

08:26.712 --> 08:27.962
Sandy Baxter,
branch manager.

08:28.029 --> 08:30.331
Tell me I'm wrong, Sandy.

08:30.382 --> 08:34.802
Tell me my accounts haven't suddenly and
mysteriously been frozen.

08:34.870 --> 08:37.538
Maybe you'd like to discuss this somewhere
a little more private.

08:37.589 --> 08:38.972
Ah, pull the other one.

08:39.039 --> 08:40.875
Mr. Lightman,
there's really no need

08:40.926 --> 08:42.643
to adopt
that tone with me.

08:42.711 --> 08:46.397
First off, to you, Sandy,
it's Dr. Lightman.

08:46.481 --> 08:48.382
Dr. Lightman. Of course.

08:48.433 --> 08:51.986
Secondly,
you're about to get robbed.

08:52.888 --> 08:53.821
Excuse me.

08:53.889 --> 08:54.906
Robbed. You know,

08:54.990 --> 08:57.742
cleaned out, hit hard,

08:57.826 --> 08:59.493
guns and that.

08:59.561 --> 09:01.078
You follow?

09:05.477 --> 09:06.927
Yeah.

09:11.092 --> 09:14.194
So he was mappin'
your camera blind spots.

09:14.262 --> 09:16.897
I noticed, 'cause I
backed him out of one,

09:16.965 --> 09:19.466
which is why
you see him there.

09:19.534 --> 09:21.602
So he's a pro?
Well, if he was that good,

09:21.653 --> 09:24.271
it'd take me a little longer
than 2 minutes to spot him.

09:26.391 --> 09:27.908
Why didn't your
rent-a-cop spot him?

09:27.976 --> 09:31.078
Well, you see the world
differently, Mr. Ligh--

09:31.146 --> 09:32.646
Dr. Lightman,

09:32.714 --> 09:34.498
notice things
others don't.

09:37.502 --> 09:38.786
He recognized him,

09:38.837 --> 09:41.071
which makes me think
inside job.

09:41.139 --> 09:43.874
John Agro? He's been
at the bank 8 years.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.125
I know his wife.

09:45.176 --> 09:46.794
No one robs a bank alone.

09:46.845 --> 09:48.462
Can you prove
any of this?

09:48.513 --> 09:49.713
I intend to.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.164
You can't prove a thing.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.217
Well, even so, I'd call
the cops if I were you.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.802
And tell 'em what,

09:54.853 --> 09:58.138
the facial-tic guy says we're about
to get robbed?

09:59.007 --> 09:59.890
No cops, then?

09:59.975 --> 10:01.392
That's what you're saying?

10:01.476 --> 10:02.893
Correct.

10:02.978 --> 10:05.312
That doesn't come cheap.

10:06.481 --> 10:09.516
You think you and me,
we can work together?

10:09.584 --> 10:10.684
Is that it?

10:10.735 --> 10:14.621
You think you can follow
a few simple instructions?

10:16.241 --> 10:17.908
Simple instructions?

10:19.811 --> 10:22.362
You know this man?

10:23.198 --> 10:24.398
Never seen him.

10:24.466 --> 10:26.884
Why the fear of someone
you've never seen before, then?

10:26.968 --> 10:29.103
I'm telling you
I don't know the man.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.121
Oh, that's just not true.

10:31.189 --> 10:32.890
So if you've
never seen him...

10:32.974 --> 10:34.174
You've either smelled him,

10:34.225 --> 10:37.478
or you recognized
his voice.

10:39.197 --> 10:40.814
Recognized his voice.

10:40.882 --> 10:42.683
See how your face flinched?

10:42.734 --> 10:46.553
Directly linked to the muscles
in your sphincter.

10:49.908 --> 10:53.744
On my way home
a few nights ago, I--

10:53.812 --> 10:56.363
some guys
came up behind me,

10:56.414 --> 10:58.365
blindfolded me,

10:58.416 --> 11:01.702
took me to a room,
handcuffed me to a rail.

11:01.753 --> 11:04.288
They wanted blueprints

11:04.372 --> 11:06.573
and the combination
to the vault.

11:07.909 --> 11:10.377
They knew
what they were doing,

11:10.428 --> 11:12.463
and they'd done
their research.

11:15.100 --> 11:17.134
They knew
my wife has Lupus,

11:17.218 --> 11:19.470
where she goes
to the doctor,

11:19.554 --> 11:23.273
where my daughters
go to school,

11:23.358 --> 11:25.309
which classes
they take.

11:29.030 --> 11:31.148
They threatened
my family.

11:32.817 --> 11:35.819
You haven't given them
anything, though, have you?

11:35.904 --> 11:38.105
Right?

11:39.624 --> 11:41.608
But you came this close.

11:41.659 --> 11:44.795
When you recognized
his voice in the bank,

11:44.879 --> 11:47.698
you figured your time
to think was over.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.637
I'm gonna need
those blueprints

11:53.721 --> 11:57.724
and the combination to the vault.
You have 'em?

11:57.792 --> 12:00.627
What do you need the blueprints and
vault combination for?

12:00.678 --> 12:01.812
You froze my assets.

12:01.896 --> 12:03.147
I froze our assets, Cal.

12:03.231 --> 12:05.632
Look, it's funny, 'cause I
remember hiring you,

12:05.683 --> 12:07.184
but I don't remember
marrying you.

12:07.268 --> 12:10.154
You're gonna do something insane
to help that bank guard.

12:11.106 --> 12:13.640
Absolutely certifiable.

12:15.110 --> 12:17.578
Please tell me there's a method
to your madness.

12:17.645 --> 12:20.647
Well, a man's family got threatened.
You know what I mean?

12:20.698 --> 12:21.748
2 of 'em, actually.

12:21.816 --> 12:23.584
2 family men?
Who's the other one?

12:23.651 --> 12:25.502
Well, the guy I saw
casing the bank, right,

12:25.587 --> 12:28.172
he's not exactly your armed-robber type.
You know what I mean?

12:28.256 --> 12:30.207
Little bit more to him
than meets the eye.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.592
You didn't hire me.

12:31.659 --> 12:33.827
You asked me
to be your partner.

12:33.878 --> 12:36.130
I practically begged you,

12:36.181 --> 12:37.664
if I recall.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.266
Those were the days, eh?

12:39.333 --> 12:42.603
I'll have Loker and Torres interview
everybody at the bank.

12:42.670 --> 12:48.175
And find out who knew
that the guard's wife had Lupus.

12:48.226 --> 12:49.810
And unfreeze my assets.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.779
Oh, I'm sorry.

12:52.847 --> 12:54.531
Our assets.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.322
Unused round.

13:02.373 --> 13:03.790
Safety's still on.
She panicked.

13:03.858 --> 13:06.693
Uhh. Can you throw
some more coffee grounds in the pan?

13:06.744 --> 13:08.462
This one's really
startin' to stink.

13:08.529 --> 13:10.464
Hey, there, eh?

13:10.531 --> 13:12.699
I'm with her.

13:14.219 --> 13:16.587
Last time I saw you,
you maced me.

13:16.671 --> 13:19.139
That's 'cause you
broke into my house.

13:20.141 --> 13:21.708
She didn't know
her killer.

13:21.759 --> 13:23.427
What?
How can you tell that?

13:23.511 --> 13:26.964
Well, that's fear, that is,
all over her face.

13:27.031 --> 13:28.215
No contempt there.

13:28.266 --> 13:30.434
Not just another
pretty face, huh?

13:30.518 --> 13:32.986
I need an I.D. tech.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.272
What did he steal,
a pen?

13:35.356 --> 13:37.524
Nah. They got chains on 'em.

13:38.443 --> 13:40.611
Hey, run this for me,
would you?

13:42.230 --> 13:44.815
Smells like a barista's
underpants in here.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.385
Look, I'm telling you,
although this Sarah Lange

13:48.469 --> 13:51.171
has the right qualifications on paper,
she is not an ideal candidate.

13:51.222 --> 13:54.358
Loker, I hear your concern, and I get where
you're coming from,

13:54.442 --> 13:56.226
but please
just do as I ask.

13:56.311 --> 13:57.561
Ask? You mean tell.

13:57.645 --> 13:59.012
I knew you understood.

13:59.030 --> 14:01.114
Can you give me a reason??

14:01.182 --> 14:03.567
Ideal is overrated.

14:03.651 --> 14:06.686
Lightman is gonna chew her up
and spit her out.

14:06.738 --> 14:09.039
Or maybe he'll choke.

14:12.911 --> 14:15.295
Bank job.

14:15.363 --> 14:17.047
Good case. Good collar.

14:17.131 --> 14:19.850
Federal case,
but what's the catch?

14:19.918 --> 14:23.737
And what happened to your
brother from another mother?

14:26.307 --> 14:29.259
If by that,
you mean Agent Reynolds,

14:29.344 --> 14:32.729
I severed my ties
with the FBI.

14:32.814 --> 14:34.547
I'm no one's lap dog.

14:37.602 --> 14:39.052
Wallowski.

14:41.606 --> 14:43.657
Your friend's name
is Mike Salinger.

14:43.724 --> 14:45.909
Parolee, huh?

14:45.994 --> 14:48.662
Sure. Give me the number.

14:48.729 --> 14:50.347
Mm-hmm.

14:52.700 --> 14:53.617
Yep.

14:53.701 --> 14:55.085
Thanks.

14:55.169 --> 14:56.753
Did 3 years for assault.

14:56.838 --> 15:00.173
Played field-goal kicker
with the head of a middle manager

15:00.241 --> 15:02.259
at district American Bank,
Silver Spring.

15:02.343 --> 15:03.844
Same bank he was casing.

15:03.911 --> 15:05.929
He just got out 18 days ago.

15:06.014 --> 15:08.415
Hey, where you goin'?
I feel used.

15:08.466 --> 15:10.517
You mean "dirty."

15:11.386 --> 15:12.585
Have a nice life.

15:12.637 --> 15:14.521
You have a nice smile.

15:14.589 --> 15:16.306
How would you know?

15:16.391 --> 15:18.191
I'm lookin' at it.

15:21.145 --> 15:25.265
Trust me, this has nothing
to do with your deafness.

15:25.316 --> 15:26.533
Deafness, right?

15:26.600 --> 15:28.735
Deafness. Handicap.

15:28.786 --> 15:31.071
It's ok. I'm used to it.

15:31.139 --> 15:33.957
It's just
that Dr. Lightman is...

15:35.710 --> 15:37.377
He's complicated.

15:47.255 --> 15:49.473
Nothing suspicious
at the bank.

15:50.341 --> 15:51.558
You sure about that?

15:51.625 --> 15:52.559
100%.

15:52.626 --> 15:53.844
Where have you been?

15:53.928 --> 15:56.596
This is a 70% science
at best, Torres.

15:56.648 --> 15:59.132
What's he up to
in there, then?

15:59.200 --> 16:01.034
Interviewing
grad students.

16:01.102 --> 16:02.519
Really?
To replace him?

16:02.603 --> 16:06.890
He's not the most patient
of, um...

16:08.660 --> 16:11.611
Look, I would be lying
to you if I didn't tell you

16:11.663 --> 16:13.697
what it's like
to actually work for him.

16:13.781 --> 16:15.699
Mike Salinger.
Family man,

16:15.783 --> 16:17.534
homeowner, electrician.

16:17.618 --> 16:18.919
He did 3 years
for assault.

16:18.986 --> 16:20.454
Yeah, he got out
18 days ago.

16:20.505 --> 16:22.506
Tell me something
I don't know.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.341
Is he interviewing
for friends?

16:24.425 --> 16:26.543
You'll be miserable.
He'll drive you crazy.

16:26.627 --> 16:28.512
He has no respect
for your time,

16:28.596 --> 16:31.381
much less any sort of life that
you may have outside of this place.

16:31.466 --> 16:33.166
Oh, and make no mistake.
Most of what

16:33.217 --> 16:36.687
constitutes that work will involve
nothing more than fool's errands.

16:36.771 --> 16:39.056
You should stop
worrying about me

16:39.140 --> 16:41.391
and worry more
about yourself.

16:42.694 --> 16:44.945
You can read lips.

16:45.012 --> 16:47.114
What's he saying about me?

16:52.503 --> 16:54.955
Henry Allen Miller.

16:55.022 --> 16:57.541
He was released 3 months ago,
Salinger's cellmate.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.576
Miller was the only one caught
8 years ago

16:59.660 --> 17:01.962
when this
armored-car driver

17:02.029 --> 17:05.031
ended up a paraplegic
for life.

17:05.083 --> 17:07.634
We need to get the police
involved in is now.

17:07.701 --> 17:10.387
I'm all over
that one, love.

17:11.222 --> 17:12.923
So he only did 8 years?

17:13.007 --> 17:15.040
What was he, model prisoner
or something?

17:15.108 --> 17:16.760
I'm waiting for
the prison authorities

17:16.844 --> 17:18.979
or whoever wrote his psych report
to get back to me on that.

17:19.046 --> 17:20.396
Well,
while you're waiting,

17:20.481 --> 17:22.933
I'll find Salinger and Miller through
their parole officers.

17:23.017 --> 17:24.317
Wait! Wait.
This Miller guy

17:24.385 --> 17:25.402
is clearly
very dangerous.

17:25.486 --> 17:27.186
Oh, well,
odds are, you know,

17:27.238 --> 17:29.356
they're still cellmates
on the outside.

17:38.666 --> 17:40.117
Hi.

17:40.201 --> 17:43.370
Mine's a scotch, neat.

17:44.255 --> 17:46.456
♪ Ain't seen the sunshine ♪

17:46.541 --> 17:48.191
♪ since I don't
know when... ♪

17:48.259 --> 17:49.576
How'd you find me?

17:49.627 --> 17:50.877
Magic.

17:52.580 --> 17:55.048
I got something you want, but it's
gonna cost you.

17:55.099 --> 17:57.083
Oh, you're the limey
he told me about.

17:57.135 --> 17:58.819
How'd you make him
in the bank?

17:58.886 --> 18:01.688
Well, the real question is how
didn't I make him?

18:01.755 --> 18:03.273
Hold him.

18:03.357 --> 18:04.524
Blimey.

18:05.526 --> 18:07.093
You don't look like
a bank employee.

18:07.145 --> 18:09.446
Ex-employee. Didn't he
tell you that bit?

18:09.530 --> 18:10.614
What are
you selling?

18:10.698 --> 18:12.482
Oh, now he's buyin'.

18:19.457 --> 18:22.242
Is this how you
normally do business?

18:23.327 --> 18:25.278
Oh.

18:25.329 --> 18:27.197
Oh, that's charming,
that is.

18:29.113 --> 18:30.429
I've got the schematics
to the bank.

18:30.481 --> 18:32.098
I got the combination
to the vault, all right?

18:32.149 --> 18:34.317
I'm here to do business.
What's in it for you?

18:34.401 --> 18:37.270
Well, besides the money,
it's personal between me and the bank.

18:39.030 --> 18:40.364
What'd they do to you?

18:40.448 --> 18:42.332
They downsized,
all right?

18:42.417 --> 18:45.919
I put in 15 years in that place makin'
other people money,

18:45.987 --> 18:49.172
and that--this is how they paid me back?
I beg to differ.

18:49.257 --> 18:50.624
Who was your boss?

18:52.159 --> 18:56.213
It's a plonker
named Ronnie Hart.

18:56.297 --> 18:57.848
Got a number?

18:57.932 --> 18:59.016
His home number.

18:59.100 --> 19:02.269
Do me a favor.

19:03.221 --> 19:04.388
Hold that.

19:05.974 --> 19:09.610
8 years in prison, you think they don't
teach us anything in there?

19:27.028 --> 19:29.696
Mr. Hart, sorry to
disturb you tonight.

19:29.747 --> 19:33.583
Need to find some information
on someone applying for a job.

19:35.903 --> 19:39.306
Yes. Well,
unfortunately...

19:42.060 --> 19:43.977
I got a feelin' this
is gonna be your last.

19:44.045 --> 19:46.179
Well, up yours, then.

19:55.389 --> 19:57.557
Downsized?

19:58.993 --> 20:00.861
You were fired.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.196
Did he say what for?

20:03.247 --> 20:04.748
Yeah. He didn't trust you.

20:04.832 --> 20:08.035
You're gonna give me
the blueprints and the bank combination.

20:08.086 --> 20:11.038
What, you think I'm stupid enough to bring
'em with me, do you?

20:11.089 --> 20:15.008
I know, for your sake, you better have
somebody get over here to drop it off.

20:15.843 --> 20:17.327
Thought so.

20:17.395 --> 20:20.797
49th and Blane,
30 minutes.

20:24.602 --> 20:25.769
Yeah.

20:27.772 --> 20:29.255
Ok.

20:32.043 --> 20:35.479
In your psychiatric report on Mr. Miller
for his parole hearing

20:35.563 --> 20:38.482
6 months ago,
you gave him a clean bill of health.

20:38.566 --> 20:40.400
I've worked in prisons.

20:40.451 --> 20:43.236
A clean bill of health?
Really?

20:43.304 --> 20:44.221
Doctor?

20:44.288 --> 20:47.207
Henry Allen Miller
had come a long way.

20:48.493 --> 20:50.777
So you wrote, uh--
here it is.

20:50.828 --> 20:55.048
"That he has dedicated
himself to the concept of rehabilitation

20:55.116 --> 20:57.050
"and shows no signs
that indicate

20:57.118 --> 20:59.219
any remaining
recidivistic tendencies."

20:59.286 --> 21:01.254
What does that mean?

21:01.305 --> 21:03.557
Miller paid his debt
to society, Dr. Foster.

21:03.624 --> 21:06.259
Your use of the phrase,
"concept of rehabilitation"

21:06.310 --> 21:08.845
suggests to me that there
may have been some doubt

21:08.930 --> 21:11.648
as to whether prison
had actually done that for Mr. Miller.

21:11.733 --> 21:15.185
Prison on its own
didn't help Mr. Miller.

21:15.269 --> 21:16.353
Right. Therapy helps,
so much so

21:16.437 --> 21:17.604
that he doesn't
need it anymore.

21:17.655 --> 21:18.605
I didn't say that.

21:18.656 --> 21:21.641
I know. That's my point.
Why not?

21:22.693 --> 21:25.529
Henry Allen Miller,
your former patient,

21:25.613 --> 21:28.515
is a suspect in another
potential armed robbery.

21:28.583 --> 21:30.083
Need I say more?

21:32.420 --> 21:34.487
All right.
This is it.

21:35.873 --> 21:37.040
Last known address.

21:38.342 --> 21:39.176
Dead end.

21:39.260 --> 21:41.962
Another
fool's errand.

21:42.013 --> 21:44.464
For a start,
Lightman did not tell us to come here.

21:44.515 --> 21:46.466
It's called initiative.

21:46.517 --> 21:48.301
Oh, you're gonna explain
initiative to me?

21:48.352 --> 21:51.221
Um...

21:52.390 --> 21:54.307
Can stay here and be
my lookout if you prefer.

21:54.358 --> 21:55.776
Aw, you just
wanna be like him.

21:55.843 --> 21:56.877
Any chance you get

21:56.944 --> 21:59.279
to cut a corner
or break a rule or a law,

21:59.346 --> 22:01.515
and you just expect
the rest of us

22:01.582 --> 22:04.117
to follow behind you and
clean up after you.

22:04.185 --> 22:06.987
Wow. All that
from one therapy session?

22:07.038 --> 22:10.157
You broke into my
personal calendar.

22:11.075 --> 22:12.659
You might wanna
ask your shrink

22:12.727 --> 22:15.745
why you made it
so easy for me to find.

22:20.301 --> 22:22.969
Seems like I'm not
the only one out for revenge here.

22:23.037 --> 22:25.689
All I care about's
what's in the vault.

22:26.607 --> 22:28.058
So how we gonna
do this, then?

22:28.142 --> 22:30.060
We split the job
4 ways, do we--

22:30.144 --> 22:32.262
you two and me
and my partner?

22:32.346 --> 22:34.397
All right, no, I--
no, I get it.

22:34.465 --> 22:35.916
So there's
more of you.

22:35.983 --> 22:37.350
Say no more.

22:37.401 --> 22:38.852
'Cause I don't
need to know,

22:38.903 --> 22:42.272
even if you wanted
to tell me. It's--

22:42.356 --> 22:44.491
what is it, 3 more?

22:44.558 --> 22:46.359
4?

22:46.410 --> 22:47.611
You talk too much.

22:47.695 --> 22:48.945
Anybody ever
tell you that before?

22:49.030 --> 22:50.897
Yeah, once or twice.

22:52.750 --> 22:54.451
I'll be back.

22:54.519 --> 22:59.206
49th and Blane it'll take me
no more than 10 minutes.

23:05.213 --> 23:07.380
So...

23:07.431 --> 23:09.599
It's a 6-man
heist job, then?

23:09.684 --> 23:11.685
I can't see you need
that much muscle.

23:11.752 --> 23:14.070
You keep pushing, you keep
talkin' about the split,

23:14.138 --> 23:17.290
and leavin' here with your life
is gonna be payment enough.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.177
You got any more food?

23:20.244 --> 23:23.079
I could eat a horse.

23:47.755 --> 23:49.573
Loker?

24:04.839 --> 24:06.756
Jerk.

24:06.841 --> 24:08.959
Be your lookout?
What do you think I am?

24:09.043 --> 24:11.177
More to the point,
what do you think you are?

24:12.746 --> 24:15.415
What would you have done
if that hadn't have been me?

24:15.466 --> 24:17.083
Ah, but it was you.

24:17.151 --> 24:18.752
Oh, grow up.

24:18.819 --> 24:20.887
I wrote the report
on Henry Allen Miller

24:20.938 --> 24:22.589
when I was
in my first trimester,

24:22.657 --> 24:24.641
if that's what
you're checking for.

24:25.977 --> 24:28.161
Did he know
you were pregnant?

24:36.270 --> 24:38.538
He threatened you,
didn't he?

24:49.000 --> 24:50.467
Seriously, right?

24:50.551 --> 24:55.105
How does a guy like you partner up with
a bloke like that, eh?

24:55.172 --> 24:59.359
Or how does a man
like you survive on the inside, eh?

24:59.427 --> 25:02.012
You don't know
anything about me.

25:02.096 --> 25:03.463
You owe him,

25:03.531 --> 25:05.031
don't you?

25:06.901 --> 25:09.819
You owe him your life.

25:11.105 --> 25:12.772
Shut up
and eat your food.

25:12.823 --> 25:16.192
Now you're using him
as a weapon against that bank, right?

25:18.663 --> 25:20.914
You got any salt?

25:44.388 --> 25:46.723
It's his eyes.

25:46.807 --> 25:48.391
It sounds crazy, I know.

25:50.027 --> 25:53.863
But he--he has these eyes that look
right through you.

25:53.948 --> 25:56.616
Your fear of him
sounds natural,

25:56.683 --> 25:58.284
considering
his history of violence,

25:58.352 --> 26:04.524
but the fact remains
you falsified his psychiatric report.

26:04.592 --> 26:06.710
You let him loose, doctor,

26:06.794 --> 26:09.662
when you believed
he could be a psychopath.

26:14.385 --> 26:17.253
Blueprints, but no
vault combination.

26:17.338 --> 26:19.422
You wanna live,
I want that combination.

26:19.507 --> 26:23.176
Well, it's in here,
all right?

26:23.244 --> 26:26.513
So you're gonna have to keep me
alive, all right?

26:26.564 --> 26:28.714
Otherwise, it's back
to plan "A" for you.

26:28.766 --> 26:29.983
You can shoot your way
into that bank.

26:30.050 --> 26:32.051
And good luck with that,
by the way.

26:38.570 --> 26:39.620
I told you.

26:39.671 --> 26:41.722
I don't have anything
to do with him anymore.

26:41.790 --> 26:46.494
We found this at your old house next
to his sleeping bag.

26:52.042 --> 26:52.992
What is this?

26:53.080 --> 26:56.048
I came here because I was told
he might be in trouble.

26:57.401 --> 26:58.918
It's your number.

26:59.002 --> 27:00.920
He keep in touch
with you?

27:01.004 --> 27:03.256
Your ex is a suspect

27:03.323 --> 27:05.308
in a plot to rob a bank
in Silver Spring.

27:05.375 --> 27:06.659
District bank?

27:06.727 --> 27:08.277
That's anger.

27:08.345 --> 27:09.845
I beg your pardon?

27:09.897 --> 27:11.130
At the bank or your ex?

27:11.198 --> 27:12.548
Or both?

27:12.616 --> 27:15.101
Anger's normal,
but if I saw contempt,

27:15.168 --> 27:18.037
I'd be more convinced
you were done with him.

27:19.406 --> 27:20.689
He wrote me letters.

27:20.741 --> 27:23.826
Still angry,
so not exactly love letters.

27:23.877 --> 27:25.378
There was this woman.

27:27.047 --> 27:29.615
She had Lupus.
He wanted me to--

27:29.683 --> 27:32.718
to make friends with her
and her husband.

27:32.803 --> 27:34.870
Mr. and Mrs. Agro.

27:34.922 --> 27:37.873
John Agro's
the guard at the bank.

27:37.925 --> 27:39.809
Your ex is putting
a heist together.

27:39.876 --> 27:42.745
No. That wasn't Mike.

27:44.815 --> 27:48.301
He needed me to get him
a list of names.

27:57.394 --> 28:01.230
3 years ago, the bank
raised the interest rates

28:01.281 --> 28:05.701
on our mortgage
for no reason.

28:05.752 --> 28:07.370
We had no savings.

28:07.421 --> 28:11.407
Mike called 'em, but all he could ever get
was a computer message.

28:11.458 --> 28:14.243
So one day, he took
an hour off work,

28:14.294 --> 28:15.845
which we could
barely afford,

28:15.912 --> 28:17.847
and he went down there

28:17.914 --> 28:21.350
just to talk
to a human being.

28:21.418 --> 28:23.069
Looking for one
of the names.

28:23.136 --> 28:25.137
They gave him
the runaround,

28:25.222 --> 28:28.424
so he just snapped.

28:28.492 --> 28:30.726
He lost his temper.

28:30.777 --> 28:33.362
And attacked
someone at the bank.

28:34.564 --> 28:36.849
After that,
we were finished.

28:36.917 --> 28:38.451
No income.

28:38.535 --> 28:42.621
We ended up gettin'
the house foreclosed on.

28:46.076 --> 28:48.828
Mike's never
gonna let this go.

28:57.637 --> 28:59.555
No distractions.
No histrionics.

28:59.622 --> 29:02.458
You stay with him until I reach
the teller window.

29:02.509 --> 29:05.127
He'll take care of the cameras
and the lights.

29:05.178 --> 29:07.263
Me and the others
will control the situation

29:07.314 --> 29:08.948
while you
open the safe.

29:09.783 --> 29:12.818
I need a gun.

29:12.886 --> 29:14.737
You need to shut up.

29:23.480 --> 29:27.833
He told you to kill me
once the vault's open, didn't he?

29:32.506 --> 29:33.622
Walk away

29:33.673 --> 29:35.508
while you
still can.

29:40.097 --> 29:42.765
Oh, he gets about
a bit, doesn't he?

29:42.832 --> 29:43.799
3 to go.

29:43.850 --> 29:46.185
How do you know that?

29:50.390 --> 29:52.725
I talk too much.

29:52.809 --> 29:53.926
Remember?

29:57.781 --> 29:59.298
Look. Look at him.

29:59.366 --> 30:01.350
He sticks out like
a tart in a nunnery.

30:01.401 --> 30:04.019
Think the teller's
already spotted him.

30:05.806 --> 30:08.190
You stay with me.

30:08.241 --> 30:10.076
There's the door.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.211
Use it.

30:12.295 --> 30:15.297
This is gonna get nasty.
You know that, don't you?

30:15.365 --> 30:17.333
You're well
out of your league.

30:23.173 --> 30:25.207
Excuse me, miss.

30:25.258 --> 30:27.426
Sorry about that.

30:27.511 --> 30:28.544
There's 3
in the bank,

30:28.595 --> 30:30.096
and there's 3 more
on the way.

30:30.180 --> 30:31.430
Mm-hmm.

30:31.515 --> 30:35.267
All kicks off when Miller gets
to the window, so...

30:35.352 --> 30:36.318
Offer me
some paperwork,

30:36.386 --> 30:38.554
as though I'm going
to open an account.

30:39.856 --> 30:43.192
Not that I would
ever open one here again.

30:43.260 --> 30:46.812
Your people tracked down Salinger's ex-wife.
You ready for this?

30:56.923 --> 30:59.908
What was the name of that, uh, mortgage
moron you're after?

31:01.294 --> 31:02.461
You don't even know,
do you?

31:02.546 --> 31:04.413
Who was that you were
just talking to over there?

31:04.464 --> 31:05.347
New accounts.

31:05.415 --> 31:07.133
I've been trying
to get in her pants

31:07.217 --> 31:08.250
for months.
Never say never.

31:21.615 --> 31:26.202
Oi. 10 feet between
you and the rest of your life.

31:26.269 --> 31:28.737
Who are you?

31:35.996 --> 31:38.914
You spent the last 3 years
blaming someone else

31:38.965 --> 31:40.499
for your life
falling apart,

31:40.567 --> 31:43.502
and what happens
when you find him?

31:43.587 --> 31:46.505
You want your son to have his dad back
someday, don't you?

31:51.461 --> 31:53.395
I'll meet you
at the diner.

31:53.463 --> 31:55.397
I'll even
buy you breakfast.

32:09.079 --> 32:11.247
He'll hunt me down

32:11.314 --> 32:13.649
for the rest of his life.

32:47.016 --> 32:48.734
Don't blow it now,
all right?

32:48.818 --> 32:50.035
Don't blow it now.

32:50.120 --> 32:51.287
The cop made him.

32:51.354 --> 32:52.621
"No distractions.
No histrionics."

32:52.689 --> 32:55.374
Your words, right?

32:58.912 --> 33:01.029
You got the time
on you, mate?

33:08.395 --> 33:09.646
He's with me.

33:11.923 --> 33:12.889
We're opening an account

33:12.935 --> 33:16.721
with that nice lady
over there.

33:18.324 --> 33:20.224
Now, we understand
each other?

33:20.276 --> 33:23.227
Good. All right, stop looking at her now.
Look at me.

33:23.279 --> 33:25.246
Her life depends on it.

33:26.832 --> 33:28.783
Do they give you lot
business cards?

33:28.867 --> 33:31.369
All right, I want you
to hand me one

33:31.420 --> 33:34.255
with the hand that's
on your gun right now.

33:36.709 --> 33:40.211
Ok, now tell me
to have a nice day

33:40.262 --> 33:42.096
and be on your way.

33:42.181 --> 33:44.098
You have
a good day, sir.

33:44.183 --> 33:45.416
Thank you,
officer.

33:49.555 --> 33:53.474
I told him there was a robbery in progress
and he was too young to die.

33:53.559 --> 33:55.944
No, um, I said I was having
trouble with my neighbors,

33:56.011 --> 33:57.812
you know,
domestic violence and that.

33:57.896 --> 34:00.097
What, you don't believe me?

34:00.149 --> 34:02.317
Walk out that door. Go on.

34:10.626 --> 34:12.460
Everyone on the ground!

34:12.543 --> 34:13.628
Facedown!

34:13.712 --> 34:15.996
Get down! Stay down!
Move! Move!

34:18.217 --> 34:19.283
Get down!

34:19.335 --> 34:21.452
You move when I move.

34:21.503 --> 34:23.004
Move!

34:30.128 --> 34:31.478
Get 'em.

34:31.563 --> 34:33.297
Heads down!
Heads down!

34:33.349 --> 34:34.799
Get 'em down!
Facedown!

34:43.324 --> 34:46.310
Up! Up! Move! Move!

34:47.145 --> 34:48.329
Keep goin'!

34:48.414 --> 34:50.581
2 minutes!

34:54.003 --> 34:55.536
I'll get a third,
right?

35:05.297 --> 35:08.266
Who's in charge
of home loans?

35:08.333 --> 35:10.334
Home loans?
What the hell's he talking about?

35:10.386 --> 35:11.319
That's what
he came for,

35:11.387 --> 35:12.670
or didn't he
tell you that bit?

35:12.721 --> 35:14.055
Who's in charge--

35:16.425 --> 35:17.525
is it you?

35:17.609 --> 35:19.560
Are you in charge
of home loans, lady?

35:19.645 --> 35:28.536
Is that you? Huh?

35:28.620 --> 35:30.571
That's not helping.

35:31.857 --> 35:33.190
Really,
it's not helping.

35:33.242 --> 35:35.910
3 years ago,
you made a mistake.

35:35.994 --> 35:39.747
And then when I came in here
to try to talk to you,

35:39.832 --> 35:41.816
just to try
to straighten it out,

35:41.884 --> 35:43.584
I was treated like
a second-class citizen.

35:43.669 --> 35:45.536
I was given the runaround.

35:53.178 --> 35:54.712
We're in!

36:00.936 --> 36:03.771
Freeze.
Don't say a word.

36:05.891 --> 36:08.743
Yep. 'Fraid so.

36:15.284 --> 36:18.302
How does it feel to be
on the oernd of this?

36:18.353 --> 36:21.055
'Cause I'll tell you I been
waitin' for this moment a long time.

36:21.140 --> 36:23.357
You like it?

36:23.442 --> 36:26.144
How does it feel?!

36:27.646 --> 36:30.398
Put the weapon down,
Salinger, now!

36:30.482 --> 36:32.483
Get down!
Get down on the ground!

36:32.534 --> 36:33.735
Down. Get down now.

36:35.287 --> 36:36.988
Comin' in.

36:39.374 --> 36:40.992
Bloody hell.

36:43.495 --> 36:45.747
There's a lot
of guns in here.

36:47.165 --> 36:49.050
How you doin'?
You all right?

36:49.134 --> 36:51.219
Oh, I'm good.

36:51.303 --> 36:54.689
Good. There's gotta be
at least 10 people

36:54.773 --> 36:57.058
in the Mortgage Department at any
one time, right?

36:57.142 --> 36:58.793
Right, love?

36:58.861 --> 37:01.178
All right?

37:02.648 --> 37:04.682
You should have walked away while you
had the chance, mate.

37:06.535 --> 37:08.286
Put the gun down.

37:08.353 --> 37:10.488
Eh?

37:11.457 --> 37:14.125
Well, someone's
gonna die today...

37:14.910 --> 37:16.711
If I don't get
an answer,

37:16.795 --> 37:18.529
all right?

37:19.965 --> 37:26.838
3 years ago, someone in
the Mortgage Department screwed up

37:26.889 --> 37:28.840
and put this man's life
in the toilet.

37:28.891 --> 37:30.725
Or so he thought.

37:30.809 --> 37:32.009
He snapped,

37:32.060 --> 37:36.898
and he kicks the crap out of one
of your work mates.

37:36.982 --> 37:40.518
Now, if I was the person
who screwed up like that,

37:40.569 --> 37:42.103
I'd never be able
to forget it.

37:46.191 --> 37:49.393
It's not her.
That's not the face

37:49.444 --> 37:52.213
of someone who's burying
that kind of memory.

37:53.732 --> 37:56.951
Put the gun down,
and I'll tell you who you're looking for.

37:57.035 --> 37:59.570
I'll give you 3 seconds.

38:00.873 --> 38:02.673
I'm looking at him
right now.

38:05.243 --> 38:06.961
Get down.
Get down.

38:07.045 --> 38:08.513
Hands behind
your back.

38:12.768 --> 38:14.519
He doesn't move!

38:18.223 --> 38:21.275
That person left the bank
over 2 years ago.

38:21.360 --> 38:23.561
No, that person's you.

38:23.612 --> 38:26.430
All right? That's why you didn't want
the cops involved, right?

38:26.481 --> 38:28.649
'Cause you
recognized him.

38:31.603 --> 38:33.070
Get him up.

38:34.823 --> 38:36.874
You just helped us
pull 6 wanted bank robbers

38:36.942 --> 38:38.242
into a honey trap.
Cheers for that, mate.

38:38.293 --> 38:41.212
Now you're goin'
back to jail, you bloody idiot.

38:41.279 --> 38:43.113
How do you feel
about that, eh?

38:53.639 --> 38:55.941
Mrs. Salinger?

38:58.403 --> 39:01.506
Sandy Baxter.

39:08.941 --> 39:15.180
I want to start by saying what I should
have said 3 years ago.

39:15.231 --> 39:17.966
Well, come on, then.
Say it.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.191
What happened to you
and your family

39:20.203 --> 39:22.621
should never
have happened.

39:22.705 --> 39:24.523
It was an honest mistake.

39:24.590 --> 39:27.575
Yes, the interest-rate hike
was in error,

39:27.627 --> 39:31.213
but I really don't think that I can be
held accountable

39:31.264 --> 39:33.081
for your husband
resorting to violence

39:33.132 --> 39:36.702
and--and nearly killing one of our
bank employees in the process

39:38.454 --> 39:41.907
why didn't you say anything about
the mistake you made

39:41.974 --> 39:45.060
when you made it,
Mr. Baxter?

39:45.111 --> 39:48.380
Or when the bank employee that
my husband attacked

39:48.448 --> 39:50.082
was on life support?

39:53.453 --> 39:54.636
Say it.

39:55.772 --> 39:57.255
I was a coward.

40:03.896 --> 40:06.214
I am a coward.

40:13.172 --> 40:15.173
The Lightman Group
was built on my sweat.

40:15.258 --> 40:17.776
I don't see anyone else's name
on the door,

40:17.844 --> 40:19.811
nor on my book jacket,
for that matter.

40:19.896 --> 40:21.179
The one you
haven't written?

40:21.264 --> 40:25.016
You mess with my finances again,
you and I are through.

40:25.084 --> 40:27.302
Now, you're
the language expert.

40:27.353 --> 40:30.772
Can you te me,
do I mean that?

40:30.823 --> 40:33.492
I, um--I wanted
to say thank you.

40:37.029 --> 40:39.281
He admitted
his mistake...

40:40.833 --> 40:42.851
Says the reimbursed
interest

40:42.918 --> 40:43.935
should cover
the debt.

40:44.020 --> 40:46.271
Don't ask me
how it works, love.

40:57.099 --> 40:58.033
Dr. Lightman.

40:58.100 --> 40:59.818
We were told
to wait here.

40:59.902 --> 41:01.603
Well, whoever told you
that misspoke.

41:01.654 --> 41:03.789
Or you misheard.

41:03.873 --> 41:04.906
I'm sorry?

41:04.957 --> 41:05.907
No, you're not sorry.

41:05.958 --> 41:08.643
You're confused,
Herbert.

41:09.745 --> 41:11.830
No, wait.

41:11.914 --> 41:13.582
Outside.

41:15.751 --> 41:17.169
Door!

41:19.922 --> 41:23.074
Whatever he told
you, all right,

41:23.142 --> 41:24.759
I'm not your dad.

41:27.980 --> 41:31.466
Good. Uh, I see you've
met your new help.

41:31.517 --> 41:32.651
Help?

41:32.735 --> 41:33.685
Grad students.

41:33.769 --> 41:36.137
Social psychology
and behavioral science.

41:36.189 --> 41:39.357
Charles from Berkeley
and Sarah from Princeton.

41:39.442 --> 41:40.625
Never heard of it.

41:40.693 --> 41:42.644
It's in New Jersey.

41:42.695 --> 41:43.862
Look, calm down,
all right?

41:43.930 --> 41:44.913
No need to yell.

41:44.980 --> 41:46.164
Excuse me?

41:49.402 --> 41:50.285
Look at me.

41:50.336 --> 41:55.874
There's no need
to yell!

41:59.128 --> 42:00.879
And I was talking about
your face, by the way.

42:03.332 --> 42:05.383
You're hired.

42:09.939 --> 42:10.856
Nice haircut.

42:10.940 --> 42:12.524
Thanks.
I got it just--

42:12.608 --> 42:13.859
not interested.
Told you.

42:13.943 --> 42:15.193
Told him what, Torres?

42:15.278 --> 42:18.647
What you think of me. You wanna know
what I think of you?

42:20.233 --> 42:21.700
Oh.

42:21.784 --> 42:24.286
Started therapy, have we?

42:24.353 --> 42:27.205
Had a little bit
of a breakthrough recently?

42:27.290 --> 42:28.690
You told him.

42:28.741 --> 42:31.859
Hold on.
It's not therapy.

42:31.911 --> 42:35.230
So if it's not a shrink
you've been nippin' off to see

42:35.298 --> 42:36.748
in business hours,
I might add,

42:36.832 --> 42:37.682
what is it?

42:37.750 --> 42:39.534
I don't have to
tell you that.

42:39.585 --> 42:42.036
I think you're on the hunt
for a new job.

42:42.088 --> 42:43.805
Well, wonderful.

42:43.872 --> 42:46.708
Let me know when you
need a reference.

42:46.759 --> 42:48.226
In the meantime...

42:52.098 --> 42:53.982
Right.

42:54.049 --> 42:55.216
You said 8:00.

42:55.268 --> 42:56.434
Hello?

43:01.390 --> 43:03.441
Detective Wallowski,

43:03.526 --> 43:04.993
mother superior.

43:05.060 --> 43:07.228
I know who you are,
Detective.

43:07.280 --> 43:11.366
So now you've met
the new help.

43:11.417 --> 43:13.618
Group hug?

43:13.703 --> 43:15.003
Too early?
