00:36.170 --> 00:37.503
Your future mother-in-law.

00:37.505 --> 00:39.304
Catherine:
<i>It's a nuptial contract.</i>

00:40.373 --> 00:42.641
He confessed to
your night in paris.
Oh, no.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.443
Wouldn't it be best if we
just told francis the truth?

00:44.445 --> 00:46.445
No! For me, it would not.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.113
Marry lord julien.

00:48.115 --> 00:49.782
He came to France looking
to make a good marriage.

00:49.784 --> 00:52.151
He could give
your child a name.

00:52.153 --> 00:54.386
You promised me someone
with a title.
Fine.

00:54.388 --> 00:57.523
Bash, I hereby declare you
the master of horse and hunt.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.258
What does that even mean?

00:59.260 --> 01:00.659
Henry:
Shut up and say the words.

01:00.661 --> 01:01.760
Kenna (crying):
Please! This is marriage.

01:01.762 --> 01:03.062
It can't be undone!

01:03.064 --> 01:04.730
Say the words!

01:10.837 --> 01:12.738
(impatiently sighs,
metal clinks)

01:12.740 --> 01:14.573
Your shaving mirror is useless.

01:14.575 --> 01:18.444
We'll have your dressing table
and mirror brought in.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.179
And where would they go?

01:20.181 --> 01:21.447
I don't understand

01:21.449 --> 01:23.182
Why I couldn't stay
in my old chambers.

01:23.184 --> 01:25.217
Because you're married.
Yes, I know.

01:25.219 --> 01:27.553
The king's bastard, no less,
when I asked for a man of title.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.288
(inhales)
the king gave me one.

01:29.290 --> 01:31.323
(scoffs)
the "master of horse and hunt"?

01:31.325 --> 01:33.625
That's something
henry made up.

01:33.627 --> 01:35.828
It comes with
no wealth, no land.

01:35.830 --> 01:38.564
The title I was expecting was
the duke of anjou,

01:38.566 --> 01:39.731
With a chateau in anjou,

01:39.733 --> 01:41.333
With a suite of rooms in anjou.

01:41.335 --> 01:43.669
You act as though
this were my fault.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.537
I'm no happier about it
than you.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.272
You? What do you have
to complain about?

01:47.274 --> 01:48.841
You're now married to a
beautiful woman of noble birth.

01:48.843 --> 01:50.742
Who's notorious for
sleeping with my father.

01:50.744 --> 01:52.244
I see no awkwardness there.

01:52.246 --> 01:54.847
Yes, well...
It's all in the past.

01:54.849 --> 01:55.848
Is it?

01:55.850 --> 01:57.583
We both know henry.

01:57.585 --> 01:59.518
We know he enjoys
the privileges of kingship.

01:59.520 --> 02:02.287
As you enjoy
the privileges of...

02:02.289 --> 02:04.623
Whatever it is a relationship
with my father can get you.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.291
You make it sound as though

02:06.293 --> 02:07.459
I'm the most
self-centered woman in France.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.727
Oh, I can't say that.

02:08.729 --> 02:09.461
I haven't met
all the women in France.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.729
Fine.

02:10.731 --> 02:12.865
Then all I care about it me.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.833
And all you care about is mary.

02:16.369 --> 02:18.604
I'm not jealous, truly.

02:18.606 --> 02:20.472
But a love like that,

02:20.474 --> 02:22.774
Could destroy both of our lives.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.611
She's married.

02:25.613 --> 02:27.179
It's in the past.

02:28.515 --> 02:31.483
(sighs) all right, yes,
I see your point.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.319
(sighs) we both need to
keep our pasts in the past.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.588
This is our life
now, kenna.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.323
It's not what we chose,

02:38.325 --> 02:42.761
But we're married before
king and god, till death.

02:42.763 --> 02:45.531
I won't pretend
I love you, but...

02:45.533 --> 02:49.368
We should probably start
liking each other at least.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.603
From the sultan in
constantinople.

02:51.605 --> 02:53.272
How long will they
keep coming?

02:53.274 --> 02:54.540
Oh, my mother said
gifts for her wedding

02:54.542 --> 02:56.508
Were drifting in
for a good year.
(groans)

02:56.510 --> 02:58.210
A bridle?

02:58.212 --> 02:59.611
Secretary:
For the arabian thoroughbred

02:59.613 --> 03:00.879
Now in your stables,
your grace.

03:00.881 --> 03:02.514
Ah.

03:02.516 --> 03:03.649
Better try it on your wife.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.185
It may help you to
keep her in hand.

03:06.187 --> 03:08.420
(laughter)

03:10.190 --> 03:11.924
Music.

03:11.926 --> 03:12.925
Care for a dance?

03:12.927 --> 03:14.960
Mm.

03:14.962 --> 03:16.662
Thank you for
understanding.

03:16.664 --> 03:19.565
Does the court truly not notice
the change in your father?

03:19.567 --> 03:21.533
Any who do are
keeping their mouths shut.

03:21.535 --> 03:25.537
And the rest attribute my
father's behavior to his temper.

03:25.539 --> 03:28.574
France cannot be
governed by a mad king.

03:30.677 --> 03:32.444
He's ill, mary.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.613
They can find
no trace of poison,

03:34.615 --> 03:36.682
Perhaps something is wrong.

03:36.684 --> 03:39.618
He needs our compassion.
Time to recover.

03:39.620 --> 03:41.520
And what if
he doesn't recover?

03:43.289 --> 03:45.624
My mother's doing her best
to divert important matters

03:45.626 --> 03:47.626
From the king to her;

03:47.628 --> 03:49.962
Trying to run the country
behind my father's back;

03:49.964 --> 03:52.898
Keeping the world
from seeing how sick he is.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.967
These days he seems
infatuated by penelope.

03:54.969 --> 03:57.569
He barely even notices
affairs of state.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.805
She may be a blessing
in disguise.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.907
(penelope whispering)

04:04.277 --> 04:06.245
(laughter, indistinct
conversations, music playing)

04:06.247 --> 04:07.412
How's lord julien?

04:07.414 --> 04:09.815
He's charming.

04:09.817 --> 04:12.284
We've been riding,
walking in the hills...

04:12.286 --> 04:14.553
He taught me to skate.

04:14.555 --> 04:15.654
He makes me laugh.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.456
And?

04:17.458 --> 04:18.724
For a man we know
is looking for a wife,

04:18.726 --> 04:20.859
He's been slow
off the mark.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.462
I'm going to be showing
any day now.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.664
What if he's
not the right man?

04:25.666 --> 04:27.933
Maybe I don't
really please him.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.801
Or maybe he
just needs a push.

04:32.739 --> 04:34.806
Oh, he'll get a push.

04:38.478 --> 04:40.746
Lady lola.

04:40.748 --> 04:42.714
You're a vision of grace.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.549
Thank you.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.551
Such a lovely night, isn't it?

04:46.553 --> 04:48.887
Such beautiful music.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.758
Would you honor me
with a dance?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.393
I thought you'd never ask.

04:56.462 --> 04:57.863
You're unusually clear

04:57.865 --> 04:59.631
On what you desire
from others, lady lola.

04:59.633 --> 05:03.935
(dance music playing)

05:03.937 --> 05:06.505
I'm not complaining.

05:06.507 --> 05:07.839
We're well matched.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.542
We could be two annoyingly
direct people together.

05:10.544 --> 05:11.576
(laughs)

05:11.578 --> 05:14.046
So I'll say, directly,

05:14.048 --> 05:17.049
That I'm in a mood for marrying.

05:17.051 --> 05:19.584
But I fear I'm not the husband
most women would want.

05:19.586 --> 05:21.853
That's nonsense.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.656
You're titled, wealthy
and good company.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.559
And you were patient
when you taught me to skate.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.928
Is patience important when
it comes to choosing a partner?

05:29.930 --> 05:32.531
We live in a world where
marriage is a risk;

05:32.533 --> 05:35.467
Where a husband
may become a tyrant.

05:35.469 --> 05:38.337
I think most women would count
themselves lucky to be yours.

05:39.539 --> 05:41.673
Women run more risks
than that, lola.

05:44.077 --> 05:46.812
I was married twice before.

05:46.814 --> 05:49.681
Both my wives
died in childbirth.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.483
They died in blood and pain.

05:51.485 --> 05:53.485
Far too young.

05:53.487 --> 05:56.555
I won't go through that again.

05:56.557 --> 05:58.390
That's why I've decided
never to have children.

05:59.459 --> 06:00.826
What?!

06:00.828 --> 06:03.762
I can't lose anyone else
that way. I refuse.

06:03.764 --> 06:04.996
I don't need heirs;

06:04.998 --> 06:06.832
My line would continue,
I have brothers.

06:06.834 --> 06:09.134
But, I-I-if you want
to marry...

06:09.136 --> 06:11.570
There are ways
to prevent conception.

06:11.572 --> 06:14.072
That thought
needn't upset you.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.474
We'd be happy.

06:15.476 --> 06:18.076
I, uh, I-I suppose.

06:18.078 --> 06:19.478
That's grand.

06:19.480 --> 06:22.614
Would you consider
doing me the honor

06:22.616 --> 06:24.049
Of becoming my wife?

06:24.051 --> 06:26.651
(nervously exhales)

06:26.653 --> 06:27.586
Say, "yes."

06:27.588 --> 06:29.488
Please.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.456
Uh... Yes.

06:31.458 --> 06:32.557
(sighs in relief)

06:36.095 --> 06:39.064
I have an announcement
to make.

06:39.066 --> 06:42.033
The beautiful creature
standing beside me...

06:42.035 --> 06:44.403
Has agreed to be my wife.

06:44.405 --> 06:46.805
(laughter, applause)

06:50.042 --> 06:52.043
Oh...

06:52.045 --> 06:53.745
(gasps)
oh!

06:53.747 --> 06:54.780
Oh!
I'm so sorry, your majesty.

06:54.782 --> 06:55.881
It's all right.

06:55.883 --> 06:57.482
Wait a moment,
then follow me out.

06:57.484 --> 06:59.551
There's something
you should know.

07:01.621 --> 07:03.622
Why should I believe
a word that you say?

07:03.624 --> 07:05.524
I know you're one of
catherine's ladies-in-waiting.

07:05.526 --> 07:06.892
I am one of
catherine's ladies.

07:06.894 --> 07:07.926
One of her special ladies.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.161
They call us the "flying squad."

07:09.163 --> 07:11.062
We're trained and polished

07:11.064 --> 07:13.031
And sent to sleep with
important noblemen

07:13.033 --> 07:14.866
And report back to her.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.902
Haven't you ever wondered why
she knows so very much?

07:16.904 --> 07:18.537
It can't all be
from servant gossip.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.005
Well, I'm sure
you're well rewarded

07:20.007 --> 07:21.907
For making love to men
and then betraying them.

07:21.909 --> 07:23.542
We are.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.877
This time, the queen
has overstepped.

07:25.879 --> 07:27.646
She asked me to seduce the king,

07:27.648 --> 07:29.815
To remove him from
penelope's influence

07:29.817 --> 07:31.049
And see that he was
engaged with someone

07:31.051 --> 07:32.818
That catherine could control.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.520
I'm sure that would be
quite a notch on your belt.

07:35.522 --> 07:36.822
The most powerful man in France.

07:36.824 --> 07:38.957
He's the most dangerous
man in France.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.826
The queen briefed me.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.194
Too well.

07:42.196 --> 07:43.795
A mad king?

07:43.797 --> 07:46.164
I'm not going near him.

07:46.166 --> 07:48.233
So you told catherine "no"?

07:48.235 --> 07:50.202
The queen does not
react well to refusal.

07:50.204 --> 07:51.203
Hmm.

07:51.205 --> 07:52.637
I must leave France.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.638
Quickly.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.940
You could arrange it.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.675
You could find me
sanctuary in scotland.

07:56.677 --> 07:58.677
In exchange for what?

07:58.679 --> 08:03.148
I have information that is vital
to your safety and scotland's.

08:06.219 --> 08:07.819
Where's francis?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.988
I really need him.
He's gone to the stables

08:09.990 --> 08:11.223
To see the new thoroughbred.

08:11.225 --> 08:13.024
I think half the men
went with him.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.795
Well, this will be awkward.

08:17.997 --> 08:19.531
(indistinct conversations,
laughter)

08:21.567 --> 08:24.503
(whispered conversation)

08:26.005 --> 08:27.672
(bash sighs)

08:35.681 --> 08:36.982
Charlotte:
Hurry.

08:38.951 --> 08:41.186
Not so fast.
I pay my debts.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.289
Your grace, when you signed
your marriage contracts,

08:44.291 --> 08:46.191
You didn't know that
there was a secret clause

08:46.193 --> 08:47.726
Slipped in among them.

08:47.728 --> 08:49.628
It promises that if you
die without an heir,

08:49.630 --> 08:51.863
Scotland will belong to France.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.165
How do you know this?

08:54.167 --> 08:56.301
I was ordered to
sleep with the bishop,

08:56.303 --> 08:59.070
See if he was open to
amending the contracts.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.540
Drive!

09:01.542 --> 09:03.275
Charlotte:
Be careful, your grace.

09:03.277 --> 09:04.709
Without an heir,
you're worth more to them

09:04.711 --> 09:06.077
Dead than alive.

09:16.689 --> 09:18.023
A "secret clause"?

09:18.025 --> 09:19.891
This is exactly
the sort of trick

09:19.893 --> 09:21.626
My family would pull.

09:21.628 --> 09:24.095
Well, the contracts went on
forever, page after page.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.565
Some were even in latin.
Well, I'm sure
it was well hidden.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.767
I'm going to go to my mother and
demand to know if it's true

09:28.769 --> 09:30.635
And what the hell she and my
father think they're doing.

09:30.637 --> 09:32.103
They think
they're getting insurance.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.638
In case I'm not cooperative

09:33.640 --> 09:35.106
In laying claim
to the throne of England.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.741
If I don't provide an heir...

09:36.743 --> 09:38.577
Then there's a
sword hanging over you.

09:38.579 --> 09:41.112
If you're not named the
english queen's successor,

09:41.114 --> 09:43.915
My father can cut
his losses, kill you

09:43.917 --> 09:46.785
And gain scotland to use as his
staging area to invade England.

09:48.254 --> 09:51.056
If he can't use me to get
England while I'm alive...

09:51.058 --> 09:54.626
He'll use me dead.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.161
Francis, don't tell
your mother just yet.

09:56.163 --> 09:58.663
I don't want her
to know that we know.

09:58.665 --> 10:00.665
We must find out if charlotte
was telling the truth

10:00.667 --> 10:04.069
Or if she just concocted a story
to get herself out of France.

10:04.071 --> 10:06.004
We need to get
that contract.

10:06.006 --> 10:08.640
It's the only way to confirm
what charlotte said is true.

10:08.642 --> 10:10.342
Where does the king
keep his important papers?

10:10.344 --> 10:11.810
In his chambers, mostly.

10:11.812 --> 10:13.078
The guards are unlikely

10:13.080 --> 10:14.813
To let you or me in
without a good reason.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.984
There's one person I know
that they will let in.

10:20.653 --> 10:23.288
There's a special paper
I need to find and...

10:24.757 --> 10:25.890
...It's in henry's chambers.

10:27.326 --> 10:28.893
Mary, the king's lost his mind!

10:30.196 --> 10:31.763
I'd be taking
my own life into my hands.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.198
Also, I'm a married woman
and I promised bash.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.899
I understand.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.701
And if you can't do it,
I won't press you.

10:36.703 --> 10:39.838
But you should know what
I need you to look for.

10:39.840 --> 10:43.174
Henry and catherine...
(sighs)

10:43.176 --> 10:44.909
Have betrayed the alliance.

10:44.911 --> 10:47.178
They deceived me
into signing a contract

10:47.180 --> 10:49.047
That gives our scotland
to the french.

10:49.049 --> 10:51.182
If I die without an heir,

10:51.184 --> 10:53.852
Scotland will lose her freedom.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.353
That cannot happen.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.756
We must do something.

11:02.728 --> 11:05.263
Guard: The king is not in
his chambers, lady kenna.

11:05.265 --> 11:07.065
He asked me to wait for him.

11:42.101 --> 11:44.169
"paragraph two.

11:44.171 --> 11:46.204
"in case of wife's death...

11:46.206 --> 11:48.773
Guard:
My lord!

11:58.984 --> 12:00.452
Kenna.

12:00.454 --> 12:02.120
(door closes)

12:04.023 --> 12:05.490
I know why you're here.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.726
You do?

12:07.728 --> 12:09.794
Mm-hmm.

12:11.063 --> 12:12.731
You miss me.

12:16.368 --> 12:17.869
It's a copy.

12:17.871 --> 12:18.937
Without my signature.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.138
Who knows where the original is.

12:20.140 --> 12:22.774
I'm sorry, mary.

12:22.776 --> 12:23.842
You've been betrayed.

12:23.844 --> 12:26.244
This is nothing more

12:26.246 --> 12:28.012
Than a license to murder
whenever it's convenient.

12:28.014 --> 12:29.380
It's not just
a threat to me.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.382
It's a threat to my country.

12:31.384 --> 12:33.418
This alliance was supposed
to strengthen us

12:33.420 --> 12:36.521
Against England,
not sell us out.

12:36.523 --> 12:38.423
I'll write to my mother.

12:38.425 --> 12:40.191
When she hears of this...
Mary, it's not just my family

12:40.193 --> 12:41.893
That's betrayed you.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.328
Your mother's advisor
spent hours

12:46.465 --> 12:49.200
I've just looked through
the ledgers of the treasury.

12:49.202 --> 12:52.203
On the day of our marriage,
a surprisingly large payment

12:52.205 --> 12:53.772
Was made to marie de guise

12:53.774 --> 12:55.507
For services rendered the crown.

13:00.079 --> 13:02.113
She was desperate for money
to prop up her rule,

13:02.115 --> 13:04.983
And I'm sure she thought that
this was an easy way to get it.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.385
That you would conceive an heir,
live a long and happy life,

13:07.387 --> 13:08.887
And never even know about it.

13:08.889 --> 13:12.791
We will have a son,
mary, in time.

13:13.959 --> 13:16.127
I know.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.530
We can't hand this off
to someone else.

13:18.532 --> 13:20.865
All of our parents
are in on it.

13:20.867 --> 13:22.267
I know.

13:22.269 --> 13:23.868
They won't lift a finger
to change things.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.871
Unless they're forced.

13:26.873 --> 13:30.008
My mother is
under immense pressure

13:30.010 --> 13:32.043
From the protestant
faction in scotland.

13:32.045 --> 13:33.411
They would love to oust her

13:33.413 --> 13:35.280
And see the nation
under protestant rule.

13:35.282 --> 13:37.882
What if they found out

13:37.884 --> 13:40.018
That she had sold out
her country for money?

13:40.020 --> 13:42.020
Her political enemies.

13:42.022 --> 13:43.888
Don't you think that they
would use that against her?

13:43.890 --> 13:46.291
They'd whip up scotland
into a frenzy.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.027
To save her rule,
she'll have to deny it.

13:49.029 --> 13:51.329
Say she'd never think
of doing such a thing.

13:51.331 --> 13:53.865
Publicly distance herself
from ever trying it.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.600
She would have to find
her copy of the contract.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.435
And burn it.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.304
And when France sees scotland
baying for french blood...

13:59.306 --> 14:01.172
It'll be the same.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.107
My father is obsessed
with England.

14:03.109 --> 14:04.909
He doesn't want to waste
the lives of his troops

14:04.911 --> 14:06.978
On a pointless war
with scotland.

14:06.980 --> 14:09.914
And my mother...
No, she knows this is
no time for a war.

14:09.916 --> 14:12.317
Not with a mad king
leading the army.

14:12.319 --> 14:14.385
Francis, if this works,
your parents

14:14.387 --> 14:16.054
Will have to burn the evidence.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.856
It'll be as if the
contract never existed.

14:17.858 --> 14:19.390
Once the news is in scotland,

14:19.392 --> 14:21.292
We can trust your mother's
enemies to do the rest.

14:21.294 --> 14:24.395
But are you sure you want
to do it this way, mary?

14:24.397 --> 14:26.898
You are setting your mother up
for a very hard time.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.967
Then she shouldn't
have deceived me.

14:29.635 --> 14:31.169
My first duty is

14:31.171 --> 14:32.437
Not to my mother.

14:32.439 --> 14:33.905
I am the queen of scotland,

14:33.907 --> 14:35.440
Not the queen of marie de guise.

14:35.442 --> 14:38.476
Well, the hard part of the plan
will be getting

14:38.478 --> 14:39.878
The word out of France.

14:39.880 --> 14:41.212
My mother will be suspicious

14:41.214 --> 14:43.548
Of any letters addressed
to scottish protestants.

14:46.018 --> 14:48.286
I think the next step...

14:48.288 --> 14:49.888
Is to have a party.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.397
(festive music playing,
indistinct chatter, laughing)

14:59.399 --> 15:01.499
(shouting happily)

15:01.501 --> 15:03.468
(laughter)

15:03.470 --> 15:06.337
Did you have to invite
quite so many...

15:06.339 --> 15:09.207
Scots?

15:09.209 --> 15:10.642
Diplomacy.

15:10.644 --> 15:12.243
I want my countrymen to know

15:12.245 --> 15:13.978
That France doesn't have
all of my attention.

15:13.980 --> 15:14.979
Hmm.

15:14.981 --> 15:17.382
I don't suppose you have

15:17.384 --> 15:19.484
Seen my lady charlotte
around, have you?

15:19.486 --> 15:20.952
She seems to have disappeared.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.954
Oh.
Oh.

15:22.956 --> 15:24.622
Because someone said

15:24.624 --> 15:27.125
They saw her
speaking with you.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.660
Ah.

15:28.662 --> 15:31.963
My ladies can be quite
temperamental sometimes.

15:31.965 --> 15:34.265
They're like
disgruntled servants

15:34.267 --> 15:36.534
Who get turned out
for breaking the crockery.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.970
They blame their mistress.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.539
And carry lying tales.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.541
She only said she was sorry

15:43.543 --> 15:45.543
For spilling her drink on me.

15:45.545 --> 15:47.612
But I will bear
your warning in mind

15:47.614 --> 15:49.347
If I ever have
a conversation with her.

15:49.349 --> 15:50.715
Oh.

15:52.985 --> 15:55.386
If she finds out,
if she's even suspicious,

15:55.388 --> 15:57.622
She could do anything.

15:57.624 --> 15:59.490
She's just irritated
that we've invited

15:59.492 --> 16:01.526
Every scot within a hundred
miles of french court.

16:01.528 --> 16:04.295
All to hide our
interest in just one.

16:04.297 --> 16:08.433
Lord mckenzie is concluding
a deal with the french military

16:08.435 --> 16:11.035
To provide wool
for their uniforms.

16:11.037 --> 16:13.104
He's expected to go home
any day now.

16:14.306 --> 16:15.573
Francis:
Anyone we trust

16:15.575 --> 16:17.175
To make the news
public in scotland

16:17.177 --> 16:18.710
Could go straight
to marie de guise instead

16:18.712 --> 16:20.178
And demand payment
for their silence.

16:20.180 --> 16:22.046
Years ago, he fought
with my father

16:22.048 --> 16:23.114
Against the english.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.382
He is a loyal man.

16:24.384 --> 16:25.383
Francis:
Years ago,

16:25.385 --> 16:27.051
He was a loyal man.

16:27.053 --> 16:28.453
He has spent the time since then

16:28.455 --> 16:30.254
Becoming a wealthy,
comfortable man.

16:30.256 --> 16:32.390
Will he want to anger
the french government?

16:32.392 --> 16:34.525
Risk losing his business deal?

16:34.527 --> 16:37.462
I suppose we'll find out.

16:37.464 --> 16:39.297
(men cheering)

16:48.007 --> 16:50.541
Henry is adding
diamonds to my crown

16:50.543 --> 16:53.344
To sparkle as I do,
he says.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.747
Don't you think
a royal crown suits me?

16:55.749 --> 16:57.749
Of course, your majesty.

16:57.751 --> 16:59.517
It makes your head look smaller.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.020
Almost back to normal size.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.224
You're a saucy one,
aren't you?

17:06.226 --> 17:08.459
I beg your pardon?

17:08.461 --> 17:09.594
(laughs)
saucy?

17:09.596 --> 17:10.762
Don't be offended.

17:10.764 --> 17:12.263
It's a good word, "saucy."

17:12.265 --> 17:14.532
It's sauce that makes

17:14.534 --> 17:16.534
Food worth eating.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.337
And women like you
that make life worth living.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.539
You're outrageous.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.175
Oh, don't take yourself
away from me, beauty.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.276
Do you know who I am?

17:25.278 --> 17:26.377
I can guess.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.312
From the clues I'd say, uh,

17:28.314 --> 17:29.647
You're a lady-in-waiting.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.350
You're too well-dressed
to be anything else.

17:32.352 --> 17:34.452
And by the fleur-de-lis
on your bracelet,

17:34.454 --> 17:35.686
You serve
the queen of France.

17:35.688 --> 17:38.322
And by the tone
of your conversation

17:38.324 --> 17:39.824
With the queen,

17:39.826 --> 17:41.692
I'd say you're out of favor.

17:43.295 --> 17:45.196
You're right.

17:45.198 --> 17:48.132
I do serve the queen of France.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.301
(gasps)

17:50.303 --> 17:52.303
Well, if it isn't

17:52.305 --> 17:55.139
The master of...

17:55.141 --> 17:57.775
Two amusing things.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.310
How's marriage
treating you?

17:59.312 --> 18:01.245
As well as can be expected.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.280
(chuckles)

18:02.282 --> 18:03.648
(gasps)

18:03.650 --> 18:05.550
Have you seen
lady eugenie tonight?

18:05.552 --> 18:07.819
Will her charming bosom
fall out of that gown?

18:07.821 --> 18:09.120
What do you think?

18:09.122 --> 18:10.822
I think I'm married.

18:10.824 --> 18:12.657
No reason
to let that slow you down.

18:12.659 --> 18:15.426
The lady kenna could teach
you something about that.

18:15.428 --> 18:17.261
Probably a few
other things, too.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.397
Oh?

18:19.399 --> 18:20.832
Her wedding barely past,

18:20.834 --> 18:22.133
And there she was, her rump

18:22.135 --> 18:23.534
Like a ripe apple in my hand.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.702
I'd forgotten
how she looks from behind,

18:24.704 --> 18:26.471
Perky as a young deer.

18:26.473 --> 18:29.140
You know how when you see
the white tail of a hind,

18:29.142 --> 18:31.442
And you long to bury
your arrow in...

18:31.444 --> 18:34.145
Am I to understand you called
lady kenna to your chambers?

18:34.147 --> 18:35.713
I gave no summons.
She was waiting for me.

18:35.715 --> 18:37.248
You can't blame the girl.

18:39.685 --> 18:41.719
Think.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.388
You could have a king's son
as your firstborn.

18:47.593 --> 18:50.761
My gift to you.

18:56.735 --> 19:00.371
Your queen wishes
to have a word with you.

19:04.710 --> 19:06.277
Just you.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.379
My men like to stay close.

19:08.381 --> 19:09.847
The queen wants privacy.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.482
Oh, it'll be private.

19:11.484 --> 19:13.551
They'll be just
outside the door.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.859
Mary, I don't like this.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.361
Well, you're right.
We don't know

19:23.363 --> 19:24.929
If we can trust lord mckenzie.

19:24.931 --> 19:27.498
Or anyone.
I know, but...

19:27.500 --> 19:29.333
Change of plan.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.902
Lord mckenzie...

19:30.904 --> 19:32.570
Why do your men
stay outside?

19:32.572 --> 19:33.905
They can hear
what I have to say.

19:45.784 --> 19:47.785
Well, lass...

19:47.787 --> 19:49.453
Why am I here?

19:49.455 --> 19:52.390
You fought with my father
at solway moss.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.392
What was it like?

19:54.394 --> 19:57.795
It was hell on earth.

19:57.797 --> 19:59.931
I listened to the
screams of men impaled

19:59.933 --> 20:02.333
With arrows as they
died on that marsh.

20:02.335 --> 20:04.402
And at day's end,

20:04.404 --> 20:07.805
Your father
limped home and died.

20:07.807 --> 20:10.208
And did your heart
die with him?

20:10.210 --> 20:13.711
For the past ten years,

20:13.713 --> 20:15.379
You have lived here,
in the safety of France,

20:15.381 --> 20:17.215
And I've seen too much
suffering at home.

20:17.217 --> 20:18.649
And you would ask of my heart?

20:18.651 --> 20:20.351
Ask me that question

20:20.353 --> 20:22.486
When you have earned the right.

20:28.727 --> 20:30.461
The day of my marriage,

20:30.463 --> 20:33.497
A secret contract was slipped
in amongst the others.

20:33.499 --> 20:35.733
The french arranged it
with my mother.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.469
It gives scotland to France,

20:38.471 --> 20:40.371
If I die without an heir.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.340
I cannot allow it to stand.

20:42.342 --> 20:43.574
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

20:43.576 --> 20:44.842
I cannot allow it.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.777
I may live in France,

20:46.779 --> 20:49.480
But I have the heart of a scot.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.415
France has betrayed us!

20:51.417 --> 20:53.584
So I charge you men

20:53.586 --> 20:56.754
To take the news with you.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.823
Tell the world.

20:58.825 --> 21:02.393
But most especially,
tell lord hardie,

21:02.395 --> 21:05.663
The leader of the protestants
who oppose my mother.

21:05.665 --> 21:07.665
They will raise such a stink,

21:07.667 --> 21:09.667
The contract
will never survive.

21:09.669 --> 21:11.569
You'd defy marie de guise?

21:11.571 --> 21:13.671
I would defy the devil himself
if he tried

21:13.673 --> 21:15.339
To buy and sell my country!

21:15.341 --> 21:19.810
I will not risk
scotland's freedom.

21:22.347 --> 21:24.482
So...

21:24.484 --> 21:27.551
Like my father, I ask you
to give up your comfort.

21:27.553 --> 21:29.754
To do what is right.

21:29.756 --> 21:31.756
You will lose
your business deal.

21:31.758 --> 21:35.293
You will earn
the anger of my mother.

21:35.295 --> 21:38.696
And I have nothing to give you

21:38.698 --> 21:40.698
In exchange,
except my gratitude.

21:58.016 --> 22:00.584
Your majesty.

22:03.989 --> 22:07.558
We have waited
a long, long time

22:07.560 --> 22:09.493
For you to rise.

22:23.975 --> 22:26.077
That was amazing.
I never...

22:26.079 --> 22:27.878
In France, the queen
is the person

22:27.880 --> 22:29.480
Who is married
to the king.

22:29.482 --> 22:32.016
But to those men, you
are their liege lord,

22:32.018 --> 22:34.485
The one to whom oaths
of loyalty are made.

22:34.487 --> 22:36.821
No one's ever looked
at me like that before.

22:36.823 --> 22:40.558
I can still feel it,
like a weight in my chest.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.626
All my life,
I have been a chess piece

22:42.628 --> 22:43.861
In other
people's courts.

22:43.863 --> 22:45.696
But now I have
the responsibility.

22:45.698 --> 22:47.965
Mary, your people have been
ruled by a regent for too long.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.867
They are ready to give
their hearts to you,

22:49.869 --> 22:51.102
The true queen.

22:51.104 --> 22:52.903
There is power there,

22:52.905 --> 22:54.705
If you can take it and keep it.

22:58.977 --> 23:01.479
Liam: Like a bit of
privacy, do you?

23:01.481 --> 23:03.647
Afraid for your
reputation?
You could say that.

23:03.649 --> 23:05.916
So you've never been

23:05.918 --> 23:07.752
To french court before.

23:07.754 --> 23:09.453
My first night
and my last.

23:09.455 --> 23:10.855
Mmm...

23:10.857 --> 23:13.023
I return to paris tomorrow,
with lord mckenzie,

23:13.025 --> 23:15.426
To conclude our business,
and then..

23:15.428 --> 23:16.627
Back home to scotland.

23:16.629 --> 23:18.629
Really?

23:18.631 --> 23:20.431
Have you ever
been to scotland?

23:20.433 --> 23:23.567
My duty doesn't allow me
to travel beyond France.

23:23.569 --> 23:25.636
Oh, yes, the queen.

23:26.505 --> 23:27.738
You can't leave her.

23:27.740 --> 23:30.141
Tedious though
her company may be,

23:30.143 --> 23:32.510
I'll never really escape her.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.545
Mmm.

23:34.547 --> 23:37.047
Tell me about scotland.

23:37.049 --> 23:41.952
Well, cold and harsh,
some call her.

23:41.954 --> 23:45.122
But with beauty

23:45.124 --> 23:46.924
That can pierce your heart.

23:52.631 --> 23:53.898
(moans)

23:56.168 --> 23:58.169
(door opens)

24:00.071 --> 24:02.540
The king's chambers?
Excuse me?

24:02.542 --> 24:03.741
Do you deny you were there?

24:06.878 --> 24:09.013
We didn't...

24:09.015 --> 24:10.648
Actually have sex.

24:10.650 --> 24:11.916
I don't want to calibrate

24:11.918 --> 24:13.083
The exact inch you stopped.

24:13.085 --> 24:14.652
We had
an agreement.

24:14.654 --> 24:15.920
I remember.

24:15.922 --> 24:17.521
I also remember you
jumping very high

24:17.523 --> 24:18.956
To answer mary's
beck and call.

24:20.759 --> 24:22.026
So your visiting my father

24:22.028 --> 24:23.828
Is a form of childish payback?

24:23.830 --> 24:25.830
Or payment for... What?

24:25.832 --> 24:28.065
You think I went to the
king's chambers for fun?

24:28.067 --> 24:29.700
He's lost his mind.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.535
I was terrified
the whole time I was with him.

24:31.537 --> 24:32.670
Why did you go to him, then?

24:32.672 --> 24:34.071
For mary. My queen.

24:34.073 --> 24:35.806
She asked
me to find

24:35.808 --> 24:38.075
A secret document
that put my country at risk.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.544
Mary sent you into
the lion's den?
She asked,

24:40.546 --> 24:41.679
And I agreed.

24:41.681 --> 24:42.947
I know you
don't think

24:42.949 --> 24:44.181
I notice anything
that's not

24:44.183 --> 24:45.683
A pretty dress
or a jewel,

24:45.685 --> 24:46.684
But strangely enough,

24:46.686 --> 24:47.918
I give a damn about my country.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.553
Henry came in

24:49.555 --> 24:50.788
Just as I
found the paper,

24:50.790 --> 24:52.189
And there was
nothing I could do.

24:52.191 --> 24:54.758
I couldn't tell him why
I was really there.

24:56.928 --> 24:59.096
His very touch makes me ill.

24:59.098 --> 25:01.065
I'm sorry.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.267
My country was at stake,

25:03.269 --> 25:04.935
But what was at stake for you

25:04.937 --> 25:06.737
When mary batted her eyes
and you rushed off

25:06.739 --> 25:08.105
To be her true
and gentle knight?

25:08.107 --> 25:10.941
You'll never be
that knight for me.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.911
You'll be my husband,
but never that.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.746
Stop.

25:15.748 --> 25:18.782
Kenna: This marriage is
based on nothing.

25:20.986 --> 25:23.854
What a pair my father tied
together for a lifetime.

25:26.124 --> 25:28.993
(bell tolling)

25:28.995 --> 25:30.227
(door opens)

25:31.963 --> 25:33.664
I love getting
a mysterious summons

25:33.666 --> 25:35.266
From my bride-to-be.

25:35.268 --> 25:37.134
Julien, thank you
for coming.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.203
There's something
I have to tell you.

25:41.139 --> 25:42.606
Is it about the wedding?

25:43.875 --> 25:46.143
Y-your... Family?

25:47.979 --> 25:49.580
Have you changed your mi...?
I'm pregnant.

25:54.886 --> 25:57.087
(sighs)

25:59.024 --> 26:01.792
That's why mary pushed me
towards you so aggressively.

26:03.628 --> 26:05.863
Why you said yes so quickly.

26:05.865 --> 26:08.766
I know this all
happened so fast, but...

26:08.768 --> 26:10.100
Do you care for me at all?

26:10.102 --> 26:11.769
If I didn't care for you,

26:11.771 --> 26:13.304
Why would I be
confessing to you now?

26:13.306 --> 26:16.106
Will you tell me
who the father is?

26:16.108 --> 26:19.109
No.

26:19.111 --> 26:20.311
I don't want him to know.

26:20.313 --> 26:22.580
Why?

26:25.617 --> 26:26.884
So...

26:26.886 --> 26:28.285
You've been carrying
this secret

26:28.287 --> 26:30.054
Around with you.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.288
Alone.

26:31.290 --> 26:34.258
Oh, lola.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.327
(sighs)

26:37.996 --> 26:39.897
We've both made such
a botch of our lives.

26:39.899 --> 26:41.065
How have you made a botch...?

26:41.067 --> 26:42.633
Shh.

26:42.635 --> 26:44.335
I won't ask
about your past,

26:44.337 --> 26:45.936
If you don't
ask about mine.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.144
Well...

26:54.146 --> 26:56.680
I suppose we'd better
have the wedding

26:56.682 --> 26:59.783
Before you
start to show.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.318
You still want to marry me?

27:01.320 --> 27:03.821
Are you still the most
beautiful girl I know?

27:03.823 --> 27:05.356
Yes.

27:05.358 --> 27:07.091
Are you still the most
annoyingly direct?

27:07.093 --> 27:08.292
Yes.

27:08.294 --> 27:11.862
I don't need a match
made in heaven.

27:11.864 --> 27:13.831
I'll be perfectly
happy with a match

27:13.833 --> 27:15.966
Made somewhere north of paris.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.035
(both laugh)

27:19.237 --> 27:22.973
Liam: You are magnificent
and daring.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.242
But don't you think we're
pushing our luck by lingering?

27:25.244 --> 27:26.844
If the queen were to discover us

27:26.846 --> 27:28.412
Here, in her chambers,

27:28.414 --> 27:30.314
I doubt nothing short
of our executions
would satisfy her.

27:30.316 --> 27:31.982
Wherever the queen is,

27:31.984 --> 27:34.985
I assure you
she's already quite satisfied.

27:42.127 --> 27:43.927
What are you doing?

27:47.265 --> 27:49.433
Nothing reveals
an indiscretion

27:49.435 --> 27:52.136
Quite like hair gone wild.

27:52.138 --> 27:54.338
You know where everything is.

27:54.340 --> 27:56.940
Mmm.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.277
And that robe you just picked up

28:00.279 --> 28:01.679
Fits you perfectly.

28:01.681 --> 28:03.113
Oh, it should.

28:03.115 --> 28:05.816
Because you're the queen.

28:07.352 --> 28:09.787
How perceptive of you.

28:11.222 --> 28:14.024
I suppose bowing
would be pointless now.

28:14.026 --> 28:16.927
Well, you've shown your
willingness to serve me

28:16.929 --> 28:20.330
Quite sufficiently
this past hour.

28:20.332 --> 28:22.332
But...

28:22.334 --> 28:25.335
You'd be advised,
for your own safety,

28:25.337 --> 28:27.104
To keep this to yourself.

28:27.106 --> 28:28.972
Not that anyone
would believe you.

28:28.974 --> 28:30.107
Why didn't you tell me?

28:30.109 --> 28:31.442
If you'd known
I was a queen,

28:31.444 --> 28:33.243
Would you have gone
through with it?

28:33.245 --> 28:36.780
I would have gone through
with it no matter who you are.

28:36.782 --> 28:38.282
I made love to you because

28:38.284 --> 28:41.018
You are the most
intriguing woman I've met

28:41.020 --> 28:42.352
In France.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.955
Oh, lord mckenzie
thought he was so special

28:44.957 --> 28:46.957
For having a private session
with queen mary.

28:46.959 --> 28:49.159
With mary?

28:49.161 --> 28:51.095
A private session?

28:51.097 --> 28:52.362
Aye.

28:53.965 --> 28:55.933
Now he says we're not
going to paris,

28:55.935 --> 28:57.067
But straight
back to scotland

28:57.069 --> 28:58.435
In the morning,
on the first ship.

28:58.437 --> 29:00.370
What, your business
unfinished?

29:00.372 --> 29:02.106
How odd.

29:03.808 --> 29:06.443
I wonder what he and
mary spoke about.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.212
No idea, but
he was feeling

29:08.214 --> 29:09.446
Quite singled
out about it,

29:09.448 --> 29:12.116
It seemed, by the
expression on his face.

29:12.118 --> 29:13.450
Favored by the queen.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.319
If only he knew
about this.

29:15.321 --> 29:18.222
Of course, he won't.

29:18.224 --> 29:19.456
Don't worry.

29:41.079 --> 29:43.147
Mary knows.

29:48.953 --> 29:50.354
(men laughing)
liam.

29:50.356 --> 29:51.555
Where have you
been, friend?

29:51.557 --> 29:53.524
The men and I are
going into the village

29:53.526 --> 29:55.526
For a final night
of hospitality,

29:55.528 --> 29:57.127
Courtesy of, uh...

29:57.129 --> 30:00.364
Some of France's most
experienced ladies.

30:00.366 --> 30:01.965
You'll join us?

30:01.967 --> 30:03.867
I think I won't.

30:03.869 --> 30:05.369
Ah, a whore is such
a disappointment

30:05.371 --> 30:06.870
After you've had
the real thing.

30:06.872 --> 30:09.406
But you poor fellows go,
enjoy yourselves.

30:09.408 --> 30:10.407
Very well.

30:10.409 --> 30:11.575
We sail in the morning.

30:15.246 --> 30:17.815
(horses gallop away)

30:26.558 --> 30:29.092
(choking)

30:35.567 --> 30:37.835
(laughter,
indistinct conversations)

30:43.908 --> 30:46.009
Hey, hey...

30:46.011 --> 30:48.045
Why do you keep
looking at that door?

30:48.047 --> 30:49.913
The only thing

30:49.915 --> 30:51.081
You need to worry
about opening

30:51.083 --> 30:52.883
Is my britches.
(giggles)

31:00.024 --> 31:02.125
Man: Little lassie!
Lassie, come here.

31:11.069 --> 31:13.237
(pounding on door)

31:14.205 --> 31:15.939
Agh! No!

31:21.412 --> 31:23.480
(wind whistling)

31:24.916 --> 31:26.516
What the devil
is going on?

31:27.318 --> 31:29.453
Aah!

31:29.455 --> 31:30.554
(groaning)

31:31.356 --> 31:33.257
(men shouting)

31:33.259 --> 31:34.491
(woman screams)

31:36.227 --> 31:38.128
(woman screams, man grunts)

31:38.130 --> 31:39.897
(grunts)

31:39.899 --> 31:41.131
(screaming)

31:41.133 --> 31:43.200
(yells)

32:22.407 --> 32:24.441
(knocking at door)

32:26.244 --> 32:27.411
It's done.

32:27.413 --> 32:29.713
Every man?

32:30.615 --> 32:32.416
Every man of lord mckenzie's?

32:32.418 --> 32:33.684
Yes.

32:35.386 --> 32:36.553
And the whores?

32:36.555 --> 32:38.121
The ones we paid
off got away.

32:38.123 --> 32:39.356
They won't be
coming back.

32:39.358 --> 32:41.558
The few we were
worried would talk...

32:41.560 --> 32:43.093
They died with the men.

32:43.095 --> 32:45.495
My lady...

32:45.497 --> 32:47.698
They were whoring
themselves to the
scots when we came in.

32:47.700 --> 32:49.266
It's not as if
they were innocents.

32:49.268 --> 32:51.568
(wry laugh)
no.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.437
I'm sure they chose
their vocation willingly,

32:53.439 --> 32:55.138
Happy to service men like you.

32:55.140 --> 32:56.640
My lady...?!

32:56.642 --> 32:57.641
Go away.

33:02.981 --> 33:05.716
(sighs)

33:05.718 --> 33:08.719
(distant bell tolling)

33:08.721 --> 33:10.988
(knocking on door)

33:15.593 --> 33:17.494
My condolences on...

33:17.496 --> 33:21.064
(shouts, groans)

33:21.066 --> 33:22.733
...The loss of
your countrymen.

33:22.735 --> 33:25.168
As I see, you've already heard.

33:32.210 --> 33:34.111
This was not lightly done.

33:34.113 --> 33:35.679
It's a matter
of royal business.

33:35.681 --> 33:39.649
France cannot afford a war
with scotland over the contract.

33:39.651 --> 33:41.084
And with the king ill,

33:41.086 --> 33:42.285
I simply don't have time

33:42.287 --> 33:45.088
To try to calm down
two countries.

33:45.090 --> 33:48.225
You killed a dozen men

33:48.227 --> 33:50.794
Because you couldn't

33:50.796 --> 33:52.696
Be bothered
with the extra trouble?

33:54.766 --> 33:56.767
I will never forgive you
for this.

33:56.769 --> 33:59.236
Forgive me or forgive yourself?

33:59.238 --> 34:01.772
Welcome to being
a ruling queen, mary.

34:01.774 --> 34:04.141
Men will trust you and die.

34:04.143 --> 34:05.575
These are the first.

34:05.577 --> 34:08.712
But they won't be the last.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.480
It'll go on and on,
until your death,

34:10.482 --> 34:12.349
Because that's the way it works.

34:12.351 --> 34:16.219
And a beautiful,
young queen,

34:16.221 --> 34:17.421
The men are gonna
throw themselves

34:17.423 --> 34:19.156
Into the fire for you, my dear.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.791
They'll shoulder lost causes

34:20.793 --> 34:23.693
And take on risks
they should never take.

34:23.695 --> 34:26.163
In time, you'll get used to it.

34:26.165 --> 34:29.099
You'll know in your bones
the losses you face

34:29.101 --> 34:31.401
Each time you send men out,
and you'll do it anyway.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.203
It'll be a cold choice.

34:33.205 --> 34:36.073
It's mathematical,
you could say.

34:36.075 --> 34:38.308
Because the only other option is

34:38.310 --> 34:40.710
To pull the covers
over your head and give up.

34:48.519 --> 34:51.121
Mary.

34:51.123 --> 34:52.389
I heard what happened.

34:52.391 --> 34:54.791
I've been looking for you.

35:07.438 --> 35:09.506
(lively chatter)

35:38.870 --> 35:42.672
♪

35:47.578 --> 35:50.413
(clears throat)
I need lady kenna, please.

35:57.922 --> 36:00.724
I get headaches.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.896
I'm so sorry.

36:10.735 --> 36:13.603
(gasping):
Your touch...

36:15.306 --> 36:17.874
...Your touch is so soothing.

36:17.876 --> 36:20.744
I miss your innocence.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.246
Your gentleness.

36:23.248 --> 36:25.382
Sometimes, penelope...

36:25.384 --> 36:28.251
Her voice grates.

36:35.726 --> 36:37.394
Father...

36:37.396 --> 36:38.962
Hmm?

36:38.964 --> 36:40.830
Father...
Hmm?

36:42.500 --> 36:45.468
I think queen penelope's
getting jealous.

36:45.470 --> 36:46.970
You know how women
are around you.

36:49.907 --> 36:52.709
It's a burden sometimes.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.628
I wasn't expecting
to see you here.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.430
Because mary's not here?

37:13.432 --> 37:14.664
I didn't come
looking for mary.

37:14.666 --> 37:15.799
I was worried about you.

37:15.801 --> 37:17.400
Why?

37:17.402 --> 37:18.835
Because you're not safe
in this castle.

37:18.837 --> 37:21.638
And I will always
defend you...

37:21.640 --> 37:24.241
Because you're my wife.

37:34.919 --> 37:36.987
I am surprised
you're willing to allow

37:36.989 --> 37:39.723
The bodies of your victims
to return to scotland.

37:39.725 --> 37:41.524
Those poor men died in a fire

37:41.526 --> 37:44.294
As anyone can see
from what's left of them.

37:44.296 --> 37:45.695
Their families deserve

37:45.697 --> 37:47.731
The consolation
of burying them at home.

37:47.733 --> 37:50.467
Mary queen of...

37:50.469 --> 37:53.303
I hope you're not gonna make
a habit of this bursting in.

37:53.305 --> 37:55.338
One day I might be indecent.

37:55.340 --> 37:56.873
(door closes)
I would like the contract now.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.308
In my hands.

37:58.310 --> 37:59.342
Perhaps you don't understand

37:59.344 --> 38:00.543
What's happened.

38:00.545 --> 38:02.312
You lost.

38:02.314 --> 38:03.780
Take it with grace.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.348
You will give it to me

38:05.350 --> 38:07.050
When you hear
what I have to say.

38:07.052 --> 38:08.885
My dear, there's
nothing you can say

38:08.887 --> 38:10.787
That can trump
the fact I can stop you

38:10.789 --> 38:12.689
From getting word of
the contract back to scotland.

38:12.691 --> 38:15.058
Yes.

38:15.060 --> 38:17.861
But getting word to France
is much easier.

38:18.896 --> 38:21.498
Word that the king is mad.

38:21.500 --> 38:25.035
That the house of valois
is ripe to topple.

38:25.037 --> 38:28.305
How many
dissatisfied nobles,

38:28.307 --> 38:31.508
Hungry for power, do you think
will step into the vacuum?

38:31.510 --> 38:33.443
You're talking about civil war.

38:33.445 --> 38:35.645
Every duke that has
a grudge against henry

38:35.647 --> 38:37.080
Will be lined up
outside of the gate.

38:37.082 --> 38:38.415
They'll fight us.

38:38.417 --> 38:39.649
They'll fight each other.

38:39.651 --> 38:40.717
Mary...
You wouldn't do it.

38:40.719 --> 38:42.085
It would destroy France.

38:42.087 --> 38:43.920
You are the queen of France.

38:43.922 --> 38:46.423
I am the queen of scotland.

38:46.425 --> 38:48.325
You wouldn't harm francis.

38:48.327 --> 38:51.695
Francis is welcome to join me
in scotland as my consort.

38:51.697 --> 38:53.563
Just as I am his consort here.

38:53.565 --> 38:54.964
It seems only fair.

38:54.966 --> 38:56.566
If I thought you were serious,

38:56.568 --> 38:58.568
You wouldn't leave
this room alive.

38:58.570 --> 39:00.537
I sent three riders
out this morning.

39:00.539 --> 39:03.606
Unless they hear from me

39:03.608 --> 39:04.708
With the agreed-upon phrase,

39:04.710 --> 39:05.809
They will deliver my letters

39:05.811 --> 39:08.345
To two dukes and to the vatican.

39:08.347 --> 39:10.513
The world will know

39:10.515 --> 39:12.782
That France is
open for the taking.

39:14.352 --> 39:17.087
Is she bluffing, francis?

39:17.089 --> 39:20.023
She's mary
queen of scots.

39:20.025 --> 39:22.492
I wouldn't like to guess
what she would do.

39:22.494 --> 39:26.029
You killed 12
of my countrymen.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.998
Look into my eyes
and tell me that I'm bluffing.

39:42.646 --> 39:44.047
This is the original

39:44.049 --> 39:46.549
That has your signature on it.

39:46.551 --> 39:48.818
Burn it.

40:09.006 --> 40:11.474
Francis:
<i>That was quite a bluff</i>

40:11.476 --> 40:13.009
You ran against my mother today.

40:13.011 --> 40:14.778
Amazing.

40:14.780 --> 40:17.180
I did send out three riders.

40:17.182 --> 40:20.016
To deceive my mother.

40:20.018 --> 40:21.751
Well, I'm sure you
didn't give them

40:21.753 --> 40:24.120
Dangerous messages that
could blow up France.

40:24.122 --> 40:27.090
You'd never have done that.

40:27.092 --> 40:29.859
But, I did.

40:29.861 --> 40:31.828
What?

40:33.464 --> 40:35.865
I'm going to be
queen of France someday.

40:35.867 --> 40:39.469
And I hope to be a good queen.

40:39.471 --> 40:41.137
But France has
you and your mother

40:41.139 --> 40:43.139
To look after her welfare.

40:43.141 --> 40:46.576
Scotland only has me.

40:46.578 --> 40:49.112
If it ever becomes a choice
between our two countries,

40:49.114 --> 40:51.514
I will chose mine.

40:52.817 --> 40:56.653
In whatever way necessary.
