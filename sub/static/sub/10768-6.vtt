Hey, Mr. Kareem,
they're waiting for you on the tee.

17:10.829 --> 17:12.130
Got to run, ciao.

17:12.300 --> 17:14.270
- Bye.
- Ciao.

17:15.270 --> 17:20.069
You know, honey, the color of this sweater
does compliment your eyes.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.329
Well, it is comfy.

17:22.510 --> 17:23.940
Let's go get the stains out.

17:28.050 --> 17:30.520
These are my role models.

17:33.090 --> 17:34.750
Oh, no.

17:34.920 --> 17:36.860
Oh, yes.

17:43.600 --> 17:46.900
How you doing there,
Little Miss Mood Swing?

17:47.470 --> 17:49.060
Give me the keys to the car.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.930
Oh, now I'm never gonna get in.

17:52.240 --> 17:56.300
You need to be worried about getting out.
Them rubber rooms ain't got no windows.

17:57.310 --> 18:00.970
Will, I am not crazy, okay?
This whole thing was a sorority prank.

18:01.150 --> 18:03.010
They wanted me to teach you a lesson.

18:03.550 --> 18:06.580
In what, bladder control?

18:07.220 --> 18:10.090
No, respect for women.

18:10.420 --> 18:14.120
Ugh! I cannot believe you sorority girls
could be so devious.

18:14.290 --> 18:17.350
It was actually
your cousin Carlton's idea.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.000
Oh, yeah?

18:22.170 --> 18:25.100
You know what, I'm gonna pop
that little zit when I get home.

18:27.570 --> 18:30.570
You give me the car keys.

18:30.980 --> 18:32.380
Thank you.

18:36.580 --> 18:38.020
What you crying about?

18:38.190 --> 18:39.650
You don't care.

18:39.820 --> 18:43.810
You're damn right I don't care.
You damn near fricasseed me.

18:51.500 --> 18:53.830
But seriously, though,
what you crying about?

18:54.940 --> 18:58.870
Will, the only reason I did this
is because I wanna be a Kappa.

19:01.370 --> 19:05.970
So I guess that if I don't go through
with this thing...

19:06.150 --> 19:09.380
...then you can kiss
your pledge pin goodbye.

19:10.050 --> 19:11.210
Oh, well.

19:11.380 --> 19:12.750
[LAUGHS]

19:15.520 --> 19:17.510
I deserve that.

19:19.990 --> 19:22.720
Will, I just want you to know...

19:22.900 --> 19:25.990
...that this is the best date
that I've had in a long time.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.060
I mean, before I tied you up.

19:30.840 --> 19:33.570
Like I'm supposed to believe that. Pfft!

19:39.310 --> 19:40.900
For real?

19:41.350 --> 19:44.220
WILL [WHIMPERING]:
You're right, I'm so sorry.

19:44.380 --> 19:45.940
I'm a dog.

19:46.620 --> 19:49.350
I'm the fresh prince of the pound.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.120
The doggiest of all dogs.

19:52.290 --> 19:55.350
Unbelievable. Will Smith apologizing.

19:55.530 --> 19:59.660
My sisters, welcome the newest member
of Kappa Phi Gamma, Lisa Wilkes.

19:59.830 --> 20:01.060
All right.

20:01.230 --> 20:02.630
[ALL CHEERING]

20:03.000 --> 20:05.470
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
Whoa, hold up.

20:05.640 --> 20:09.700
What, y'all just gonna leave me hanging
up here like a piece of Rotisserie Gold, huh?

20:13.110 --> 20:14.170
[BARKS]

20:26.030 --> 20:27.150
What's wrong, Will?

20:27.330 --> 20:29.160
Rough weekend?

20:31.870 --> 20:32.960
Carlton...

20:33.130 --> 20:36.860
...man, listen, my date with Lisa
didn't quite turn out the way I planned.

20:37.040 --> 20:39.200
Pray tell, why not?

20:40.170 --> 20:41.900
We got up there, the girl went crazy.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.510
She tied me to this chair,
was trying to torture me.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.670
No.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.810
But I got loose, man.

20:50.380 --> 20:52.540
Then she really went off.

20:53.290 --> 20:56.020
So I grabbed this rock, man...

20:56.190 --> 20:57.320
[WILL SOBBING]

20:57.490 --> 20:59.320
...and I...

20:59.490 --> 21:01.190
Oh, my God, she's still up there.

21:02.260 --> 21:05.860
Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

21:07.230 --> 21:10.140
Oh, God. Oh, Lisa!

21:11.540 --> 21:13.230
Gotcha.

21:14.140 --> 21:15.610
[LAUGHING]

21:16.440 --> 21:19.310
No! No!

21:19.480 --> 21:21.640
Tell me you didn't. Oh, God.

21:21.820 --> 21:26.340
No, no, no.

21:27.750 --> 21:30.850
Will, no. Oh, my God, no!

21:31.020 --> 21:32.250
Oh, no.

21:33.890 --> 21:36.120
How could you do that?

21:36.300 --> 21:38.290
Oh, no.

21:38.470 --> 21:39.690
Oh, my...

21:39.870 --> 21:43.200
Oh, God. Oh, God.

21:43.440 --> 21:44.460
No.

21:46.240 --> 21:47.800
No.

21:49.840 --> 21:53.340
Oh, God, how could he do that?

21:53.510 --> 21:55.240
How could he do that?

21:55.420 --> 21:57.380
Oh, my God!

21:57.550 --> 21:59.710
Oh, my God.
