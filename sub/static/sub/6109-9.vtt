01:06.484 --> 01:10.155
I have a hunger
that just won't quit.

01:10.321 --> 01:11.948
And, baby,

01:12.115 --> 01:15.660
I'm the chef in your kitchen
that's gonna keep feeding you

01:15.827 --> 01:18.580
and feeding you
and feeding you...

01:21.458 --> 01:22.959
Whoa, slow down.

01:23.960 --> 01:25.336
- Mmm.
- Stop.

01:25.503 --> 01:26.963
Yo, stop!

01:27.130 --> 01:29.340
Listen. Hey. You need to stop!

01:29.507 --> 01:31.050
You are killing yourself. Stop!

01:49.319 --> 01:50.779
Remember the rats?

01:50.945 --> 01:53.865
What's happening to me?

01:54.032 --> 01:55.700
End stage, baby.

01:55.867 --> 01:57.494
Vous is through.

01:57.660 --> 02:01.372
Unless we can get you
into a host body pronto.

02:01.539 --> 02:03.958
But I need a genetic match.

02:04.125 --> 02:08.086
- The question's who.
- Well, only got two choices.

02:08.253 --> 02:09.798
Annie's got the better ass,

02:09.964 --> 02:12.175
and an accent that would give
a dead pope a hard-on.

02:12.342 --> 02:15.762
But, since we talking 'bout you,
not me,

02:15.929 --> 02:18.097
you should probably go
with Roman.

02:21.518 --> 02:22.936
What you think?

02:23.102 --> 02:25.021
You're telling me
to murder my son?

02:25.188 --> 02:28.107
This is not a moral dilemma.

02:28.274 --> 02:30.610
This is survival,
your life or his.

02:30.777 --> 02:32.403
What's the question?

02:34.906 --> 02:36.825
I need to get ready.

02:39.619 --> 02:41.246
Bip, bip, bip.

03:34.382 --> 03:36.134
It should only take
a couple hours

03:36.301 --> 03:37.677
to get to Pecksville.

03:37.844 --> 03:39.804
What's the plan
once we get there?

03:43.266 --> 03:44.559
That's the plan?

03:44.726 --> 03:47.020
Roman, we're not going
pheasant hunting.

03:47.186 --> 03:48.563
That thing
had a 30-foot wingspan.

03:48.730 --> 03:50.565
You got a better one?
I'm all over it.

03:52.066 --> 03:55.653
Pryce is trying to come up with
a magic bullet or some shit,

03:55.820 --> 03:57.363
but who the fuck knows?

04:06.664 --> 04:09.375
She was so cold
when I found her.

04:11.628 --> 04:15.423
So pale,
like it wasn't even her.

04:17.759 --> 04:21.303
Just dumped her in a hole
like she was a piece of garbage.

04:25.350 --> 04:27.352
I-I know you well enough
to know that...

04:28.811 --> 04:31.397
..you're gonna beat yourself up
for this, no matter what.

04:31.564 --> 04:33.983
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to...

04:34.150 --> 04:37.028
..find a way to live with
the choice that you made.

04:37.195 --> 04:38.613
Now, you can take comfort

04:38.780 --> 04:40.490
that the cocksucker
who did this to her

04:40.657 --> 04:42.909
isn't breathing anymore.

04:44.911 --> 04:47.497
You made him pay
for what he did,

04:47.664 --> 04:49.332
and that's a good thing.

04:51.834 --> 04:53.544
When we get back here,

04:53.711 --> 04:57.256
we'll find a proper place
for her, OK?

04:57.423 --> 04:59.384
Lay her to rest with the dignity

04:59.550 --> 05:02.303
and the respect
that she deserves.

05:03.304 --> 05:04.681
Yeah.

05:04.847 --> 05:08.851
But right now, Peter,
I need you to help me.

05:10.228 --> 05:13.106
Miranda and Nadia
still need you.

05:36.754 --> 05:38.423
Ooh!

05:38.589 --> 05:40.425
Looks like Elvis
has left the building.

05:40.591 --> 05:42.635
Oh, mother-fucker!

05:43.803 --> 05:45.638
No reason to go all ipso-nutso.

05:45.805 --> 05:47.306
When that little prick
gets back,

05:47.473 --> 05:49.225
you'll have the element
of surprise working for you.

05:49.392 --> 05:50.560
Dig?

05:51.686 --> 05:53.271
Mm.

05:53.438 --> 05:55.523
Hm.

06:39.692 --> 06:42.195
Hey!

06:44.989 --> 06:46.991
Get off the road, creep!

06:47.158 --> 06:48.534
Stop.

06:48.701 --> 06:50.244
What the hell
are you doing?

06:50.411 --> 06:53.289
Move it. Move it.

06:53.456 --> 06:56.167
Get out of the way!

06:57.919 --> 06:59.879
What's the matter
with you?

07:00.046 --> 07:01.547
Move along. Hold on.

07:01.714 --> 07:03.216
Keep it moving.

07:03.382 --> 07:06.344
Nothing to worry about,
officers. I got this covered.

07:06.511 --> 07:08.054
Not only have I found something

07:08.221 --> 07:09.806
that gives my life
meaning and purpose,

07:09.972 --> 07:12.809
but I finally have the perfect
use for these.

07:32.328 --> 07:33.996
Hi.

07:34.163 --> 07:35.873
Of course we're still on
for tonight.

07:36.040 --> 07:37.500
I'll meet you at the restaurant.

07:37.667 --> 07:39.210
Parsifal it is.

07:39.377 --> 07:41.045
OK.

07:41.212 --> 07:42.922
'Bye.

07:43.089 --> 07:44.465
Anything?

07:47.593 --> 07:50.972
I've tried everything
from polonium 210 to anthrax.

07:51.139 --> 07:53.474
Spivak's cells neutralise
any reagent I introduce.

07:53.641 --> 07:55.560
- It's like they're indestructible.
-Nonsense!

07:55.726 --> 07:58.229
Natural selection is incapable
of providing perfect protection

07:58.396 --> 07:59.856
from all pathogens.

08:00.022 --> 08:01.941
When evolution enhances
a particular attribute

08:02.108 --> 08:03.568
to maximise survival,

08:03.734 --> 08:05.403
it creates a weakness
somewhere else.

08:05.570 --> 08:07.280
We just have to find it.
Keep looking.

08:07.446 --> 08:10.533
OK.

08:11.534 --> 08:13.035
Yes.

08:13.202 --> 08:15.037
When?

08:15.204 --> 08:17.206
Admit her immediately.
I'll be right there.

09:15.306 --> 09:17.183
Bip, bip, bip.

09:18.684 --> 09:20.311
What happened to lying in wait

09:20.478 --> 09:22.021
to achieve the element
of surprise?

09:22.188 --> 09:23.981
I'm more concerned
about the element of death.

09:24.148 --> 09:27.068
Yours, if we gotta wait around
on Roman too much longer.

09:27.235 --> 09:29.737
- Next on the list?
- Annie?

09:29.904 --> 09:31.530
You're never gonna find her
in time.

09:31.697 --> 09:33.074
I'm fucked.

09:33.241 --> 09:35.201
There is a plan B.

09:35.368 --> 09:39.288
Someone who, while not upir,
is a genetic match nonetheless.

09:40.414 --> 09:43.459
Shelley? No fucking way!

09:43.626 --> 09:45.461
Well then,
decisions, decisions.

09:45.628 --> 09:48.547
You want to be embalmed
or cremated?

09:52.802 --> 09:54.553
It's the only option you got.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.306
Trading a diseased body
for a grotesque one?

09:57.473 --> 09:58.933
She got a man hittin'
that trim.

09:59.100 --> 10:01.435
- That's more than you can say.
- No!

10:01.602 --> 10:03.104
It's only temporary!

10:03.271 --> 10:05.648
You use her anatomy
to get close to Annie or Roman,

10:05.815 --> 10:07.275
then you muscle Pryce
to upgrade you

10:07.441 --> 10:09.026
into one of your A-list kids.

10:10.653 --> 10:13.614
But I have no idea
where Shelley is either.

10:13.781 --> 10:16.117
Well, your daughter is having
a major sad right now,

10:16.284 --> 10:17.702
thanks to you.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.913
Cops put the kibosh on chez
shit-hole where she was living.

10:21.080 --> 10:23.040
Her pervo BF is in the wind.

10:23.207 --> 10:25.167
Roman's too self-involved
to give a shit about her.

10:25.334 --> 10:27.169
Who's the one person
Shelley would turn to

10:27.336 --> 10:28.963
in her time of need?

10:35.136 --> 10:37.513
Room service.

10:43.769 --> 10:45.104
Voila!

10:45.271 --> 10:47.815
Butternut squash and Brussels
sprouts with a balsamic glaze.

10:47.982 --> 10:51.319
One of your favourites,
if I'm not mistaken.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.195
I'm not hungry.

10:54.822 --> 10:57.491
The good news is your heart rate
is back to normal.

10:59.785 --> 11:01.912
You scared the hell out of me.

11:02.079 --> 11:03.831
Sorry.

11:03.998 --> 11:07.251
Shelley, this is not something
to be taken lightly.

11:07.418 --> 11:09.211
Why on earth
would you do such a thing?

11:09.378 --> 11:11.505
I just wanted
to make the hurt stop.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.342
Numbing the pain
does not address what causes it.

11:15.676 --> 11:17.762
I don't belong here.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.264
There's no place for me
in this world.

11:20.431 --> 11:22.350
No, that's not true.

11:22.516 --> 11:24.727
You went out on your own
and found a tribe.

11:24.894 --> 11:26.896
I saw how those people
looked up to you.

11:27.063 --> 11:30.649
Your strength, your sweetness,
made their lives better.

11:30.816 --> 11:34.403
You allowed yourself to fall
in love, to be vulnerable.

11:34.570 --> 11:37.865
It has taken me half a lifetime
to find the fortitude

11:38.032 --> 11:39.450
to do something like that.

11:39.617 --> 11:41.911
It takes a brave person to go
all in with their heart

11:42.078 --> 11:43.412
like you have done.

11:43.579 --> 11:45.081
Most people are too timid

11:45.247 --> 11:46.916
to allow themselves
to feel anything.

11:47.083 --> 11:48.584
I envy them.

11:48.751 --> 11:51.170
- Sir, may I speak to you?
- Not now.

11:51.337 --> 11:52.797
I've found something.

11:55.049 --> 11:56.550
My apologies.

11:56.717 --> 11:59.095
A very pressing matter
requires my immediate attention.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.263
I will be back as soon as I can.

12:12.316 --> 12:13.776
- Give me your phone.
- Hm?

12:13.943 --> 12:15.861
Just give it to me.

12:20.533 --> 12:21.951
Synced to GPS

12:22.118 --> 12:24.120
so we can find each other
if we get separated.

12:24.286 --> 12:26.580
How about we make sure
that doesn't happen?

13:25.848 --> 13:27.516
Ouroboros.

13:27.683 --> 13:30.019
It has something to do
with whatever Spivak is.

13:30.186 --> 13:32.980
It represents
the end of the world.

13:33.147 --> 13:35.858
Well, at least we know
we're in the right place.

13:36.025 --> 13:37.985
I'll check the back.

14:32.456 --> 14:34.166
Jesus fucking Christ!

14:38.128 --> 14:40.047
Back room's clear.

14:46.512 --> 14:47.846
Shit.

15:07.032 --> 15:09.743
Why am I getting the feeling
this is not a wine cellar?

15:23.507 --> 15:26.218
Oh, fuck.

15:41.650 --> 15:42.651
Ugh!

15:43.861 --> 15:45.946
Jesus. I think that's his nurse.

15:47.990 --> 15:50.034
What the fuck
did he do to her?

16:01.003 --> 16:02.755
Nothing.

16:02.921 --> 16:05.841
Well, if they're not here,
they might still be alive.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.093
Yeah, and we're right back
to where we fucking started.

16:17.019 --> 16:19.229
- Roman.
- What do you got?

16:19.396 --> 16:22.274
- Upir toxin.
- Meaning what?

16:22.441 --> 16:24.026
Well, I've always wondered
why your kind

16:24.193 --> 16:25.944
developed this physiological
characteristic.

16:26.111 --> 16:28.489
It has little effect
on human prey

16:28.656 --> 16:31.492
and only negative consequences
on other upir.

16:31.659 --> 16:34.578
Peter's here.
I'm putting you on speaker.

16:34.745 --> 16:36.664
Spivak is a sulfur-based
life form.

16:36.830 --> 16:40.376
Upir toxin has an extremely high
concentration of nitrogen oxide.

16:40.542 --> 16:42.169
It would only take
a minute amount

16:42.336 --> 16:44.963
to cause an extremely
robust reaction

16:45.130 --> 16:47.549
should the two substances
come into contact.

16:47.716 --> 16:50.219
This toxin
is your evolutionary advantage

16:50.386 --> 16:52.054
over a competing species,

16:52.221 --> 16:55.057
the reason you were able
to wipe them out.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.977
We need to extract it
from the glands in your mouth.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.646
- I can just bite him.
- You could.

17:00.813 --> 17:02.314
However, judging
from his research

17:02.481 --> 17:04.108
into estuarial breeding,

17:04.273 --> 17:06.734
you'll probably be running into
more than just Spivak.

17:06.902 --> 17:08.319
There's more of him?

17:08.487 --> 17:10.071
My guess is there soon will be.

17:10.239 --> 17:11.906
Given he's the male
of his species,

17:12.074 --> 17:13.575
as far as I can determine,

17:13.742 --> 17:16.328
he would need female ova
to fertilise.

17:17.329 --> 17:20.499
The most plentiful and resilient
are found in infants.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.166
Nadia.

17:22.334 --> 17:23.877
That's why he took her.

17:24.044 --> 17:25.713
That would be
a logical assumption.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.089
Roman, I need you to get back
to the lab immediately.

17:28.257 --> 17:30.259
I can perform the procedure and
start stockpiling an arsenal.

17:30.426 --> 17:32.094
We don't have time.
We need to keep looking.

17:32.261 --> 17:33.512
There is another way,

17:33.679 --> 17:35.681
but you would need access
to medical supplies.

17:35.848 --> 17:38.142
That's not gonna be a problem.

17:38.308 --> 17:39.977
Let's just hope
Mr Rumancek has a steady hand

17:40.144 --> 17:41.729
and can follow instructions.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.149
This is a bad idea.

17:45.315 --> 17:47.025
No argument from me.

17:47.192 --> 17:49.027
Well, it's not ideal,
but here we are.

17:49.194 --> 17:51.780
OK. I guess, open.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.658
Wider.

17:54.825 --> 17:57.035
Now, I need you to insert
the needle into the soft tissue

17:57.202 --> 17:58.704
just to the right of the uvula.

17:58.871 --> 18:00.414
What the hell is that?

18:00.581 --> 18:02.958
The projection on the posterior
edge of the soft palate.

18:03.125 --> 18:04.501
Can you speak normally, please?

18:04.668 --> 18:06.587
It looks like a speed bag
at a boxing gym.

18:06.754 --> 18:09.047
Oh, that thing.
You should have just said that.

18:09.214 --> 18:12.009
Now slide it in
a quarter of an inch.

18:12.176 --> 18:13.969
Any more and you'll puncture
the Eustachian.

18:14.136 --> 18:16.180
What happens if I do that?

18:16.346 --> 18:17.973
Roman will be permanently deaf.

18:18.140 --> 18:20.851
Great. Just fucking do it.

18:21.018 --> 18:22.978
Hold still.

18:23.145 --> 18:24.730
You should feel
a slight pop

18:24.897 --> 18:26.607
when you puncture
the glandular sac.

18:27.608 --> 18:29.067
Oh, shit.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.153
- Did you feel it?
- I don't know.

18:31.320 --> 18:34.364
Pull back on the plunger.
If it's yellow, we're good.

18:34.531 --> 18:36.074
If it's red,
I'll start preparations

18:36.241 --> 18:38.076
to fit Roman for a hearing aid.

18:38.243 --> 18:41.205
- Oh, you're not fucking helping!
- Ugh.

18:46.919 --> 18:48.378
Ugh.

18:49.755 --> 18:51.965
- You OK?
- Fan-fucking-tastic.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.509
Well done!

18:57.513 --> 18:59.306
Something's in there.

19:00.307 --> 19:01.809
I gotta call you back.

19:26.166 --> 19:27.626
Miranda.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.505
Oh, fuck.

19:37.678 --> 19:40.222
Bad things happen to the people
that mean most to us.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.686
You ever wonder why that is?

19:56.238 --> 19:58.824
So what are we supposed to do?
Just leave her here like this?

19:58.991 --> 20:01.326
There's nothing
we can do for her.

20:01.493 --> 20:03.537
Right now,

20:03.704 --> 20:06.331
finding Nadia's
the only thing that matters.

20:15.507 --> 20:17.593
What the fuck is that?!

20:19.970 --> 20:21.179
Careful.

20:25.726 --> 20:26.768
Eugh!

20:26.935 --> 20:28.604
Fuck off.

20:34.818 --> 20:35.986
There.

20:43.243 --> 20:44.703
It's a passageway. Come on.

21:09.770 --> 21:11.605
Sulfur.

21:11.772 --> 21:13.815
Whoa, whoa.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.903
Let's see if Pryce was right.

21:29.748 --> 21:31.583
That'll work.

21:40.509 --> 21:42.177
Hello, sweetheart.

21:42.344 --> 21:44.763
Did you come to gloat?

21:44.930 --> 21:48.684
- Of course not.
- Then why are you here?

21:50.602 --> 21:52.646
Because you're my daughter,

21:52.813 --> 21:55.649
and it breaks my heart
to see you suffer.

21:57.192 --> 21:58.694
People are cruel, Shelley.

21:58.860 --> 22:00.404
I tried to warn you.

22:01.405 --> 22:04.157
All I wanted to do
was keep you from getting hurt.

22:04.324 --> 22:06.493
But I couldn't.

22:06.660 --> 22:08.203
I failed.

22:11.373 --> 22:13.375
You were right about me, Mother.

22:13.542 --> 22:15.711
I do feel too much.

22:17.254 --> 22:19.297
Shelley.

22:21.633 --> 22:23.885
I'll always be there for you.

22:30.392 --> 22:33.020
Right now,
I need you to be there for me.

22:36.356 --> 22:38.108
Where do you think
this is taking us?

22:38.275 --> 22:39.901
Nowhere.
It's a fucking dead end.

22:40.068 --> 22:42.654
- Wait! There's a hatch.
- Let's go.

23:10.724 --> 23:13.060
- Hey, Roman.
- What?

23:13.226 --> 23:15.520
In case this goes wrong,
there's something I need to say.

23:21.276 --> 23:22.986
Everything that's happened...

23:24.571 --> 23:27.115
..you've always been there
for me.

23:28.533 --> 23:30.243
You've had my back.

23:32.871 --> 23:34.456
Thank you.

23:35.665 --> 23:37.709
We're family.

23:45.634 --> 23:47.969
In regard to the upir toxin,

23:48.136 --> 23:49.721
comma,

23:49.888 --> 23:51.807
Blinsky, comma,

23:51.973 --> 23:54.267
a competent but
lesser intellect, comma,

23:54.434 --> 23:58.563
was able to successfully
divine its efficacy, semicolon,

23:58.730 --> 24:01.191
a fact which a second-rate mind

24:01.358 --> 24:03.401
will mis-characterise
as incontrovertible proof

24:03.568 --> 24:05.779
of his genius, comma,

24:05.946 --> 24:09.741
a tautology which already
sickens me, full stop.

24:13.537 --> 24:16.540
For someone darkening death's
door, you're looking buoyant.

24:16.706 --> 24:19.543
Shall I assume you've achieved
that elusive peace

24:19.709 --> 24:21.378
that passeth understanding?

24:21.545 --> 24:23.004
Assume whatever you like.

24:23.171 --> 24:25.757
The sky is blue,
the cows are smiling,

24:25.924 --> 24:28.760
and I've found a solution
to my problem.

24:28.927 --> 24:31.179
It's a temporary fix, but we can
work out the kinks later.

24:31.346 --> 24:32.973
One mustn't abandon hope,

24:33.140 --> 24:35.934
but we mustn't be blinded
by self-delusion either.

24:36.101 --> 24:38.270
You can come in now, dear.

24:43.441 --> 24:46.111
Even for you,
this is beyond twisted.

24:46.278 --> 24:47.779
You really have lost touch

24:47.946 --> 24:49.948
if you think I would
countenance this for a second.

24:50.115 --> 24:52.742
Well, then you have to
re-acquaint yourself

24:52.909 --> 24:54.411
with the patient bill of rights,

24:54.578 --> 24:56.705
which obliges you to provide
any and all requested care

24:56.872 --> 24:58.498
in a timely fashion

24:58.665 --> 25:01.835
when the integrity of my health
and body is threatened,

25:02.002 --> 25:03.879
doing so with courtesy
and respect...

25:04.045 --> 25:05.755
God damn you, Olivia!

25:05.922 --> 25:08.008
Unleash whatever hell you want,
you rancid bitch.

25:08.175 --> 25:11.428
Expose my work,
throw me into prison,

25:11.595 --> 25:14.389
burn this place to the ground,
but I will never agree to this!

25:14.556 --> 25:17.142
Oh, Johann, such a flair
for the dramatic.

25:17.309 --> 25:19.019
You really
should have been an actor.

25:19.186 --> 25:20.520
You would have done quite well.

25:20.687 --> 25:22.314
How dare you
force your daughter.

25:22.480 --> 25:24.232
Force? I'm not forcing her
into anything.

25:24.399 --> 25:27.068
It's what she wants.
Isn't that right, dear?

25:27.235 --> 25:28.570
100%.

25:33.491 --> 25:36.661
Shelley,
how could you agree to that?

25:36.828 --> 25:39.664
She's my mother. She's dying.

25:40.665 --> 25:43.376
And she said you could put me
up in the cloud

25:43.543 --> 25:46.546
so I could rest, so I wouldn't
have to feel miserable.

25:46.713 --> 25:49.049
It'll be like
a digital vacation,

25:49.216 --> 25:50.926
giving you
all the time you need

25:51.092 --> 25:53.929
to cook up another one
of those beings in the tank.

25:54.095 --> 25:56.431
It would take years
to create another Prycilla.

25:56.598 --> 25:58.433
It might not even be possible.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.268
And the full effects of
long-term consciousness storage

26:00.435 --> 26:01.770
are unknown.

26:01.937 --> 26:05.732
Your mind stream might
lose bits of data, be corrupted.

26:05.899 --> 26:08.735
Whole parts of your personality
could degrade

26:08.902 --> 26:10.737
or be lost altogether.

26:10.904 --> 26:13.615
I don't care.
I want to go away.

26:14.616 --> 26:17.786
It's too hard trying to be me.
What for?

26:17.953 --> 26:20.789
A question that has been asked
since the dawn of time,

26:20.956 --> 26:23.333
but you won't find the answer
this way.

26:23.500 --> 26:25.627
I don't care about the answer.

26:25.794 --> 26:27.963
For all I know,
the answer is the booby prize.

26:29.214 --> 26:32.634
I'm sorry. I will not.

26:33.635 --> 26:36.221
You have no idea
what you're asking me to do.

26:36.388 --> 26:38.306
I'm asking my friend

26:38.473 --> 26:40.600
to make the pain stop,

26:40.767 --> 26:43.019
and if you won't,
I'll find another way.

26:44.896 --> 26:47.440
Ask Dr No if he really
wants that on his head.

26:47.607 --> 26:50.318
I'm not saying a word. She's
doing just fine on her own.

26:50.485 --> 26:52.779
Like you haven't been
fanning the flames.

26:52.946 --> 26:55.615
It's what I want.

26:56.908 --> 26:59.244
Please, Uncle Johann.

27:03.248 --> 27:06.376
I'll need to remap
your neural pathways first.

27:06.543 --> 27:08.044
He even thinks about
fucking with you,

27:08.211 --> 27:09.671
you rip his trachea out.

27:09.838 --> 27:11.172
He cares about her too much.

27:11.339 --> 27:14.426
Listen, Olivia doesn't care
about you. She is using you.

27:14.592 --> 27:16.845
If you could see who she really
is, what she's done...

27:17.012 --> 27:20.515
- It doesn't matter.
- What's taking so long?

27:20.682 --> 27:22.475
Charting a neural network

27:22.642 --> 27:24.728
isn't a slapdash proposition,
Olivia.

27:24.894 --> 27:26.438
I don't recall it
being this complicated

27:26.604 --> 27:28.231
when you uploaded
my consciousness.

27:28.398 --> 27:31.276
Shelley's mind is a good deal
more intricate than your own.

27:31.443 --> 27:34.696
- Little bitch.
- I'm almost ready.

27:35.697 --> 27:37.157
<i>It took me 20 years</i>

27:37.324 --> 27:38.825
<i>to realise how much
I wanted your heart.</i>

27:38.992 --> 27:40.827
<i>Now it's mine.</i>

27:41.995 --> 27:44.205
- Uncle Norman.
- Turn it off.

27:44.372 --> 27:46.916
Turn it off now, or I'll end
your miserable fucking life!

27:47.083 --> 27:49.336
- No!
- Ugh!

27:51.004 --> 27:52.464
You killed him!

27:52.630 --> 27:54.466
Shelley, no, I...

27:54.632 --> 27:57.344
It's... It's fake.

27:57.510 --> 27:59.846
Something he created
on his computer.

28:00.013 --> 28:02.849
You know I could never
do something like that.

28:03.016 --> 28:05.643
He's trying to turn you
against me.

28:05.810 --> 28:08.855
Stop lying to me.
All you ever do is lie!

28:09.022 --> 28:11.566
How does it feel
to not be able to breathe?

28:11.733 --> 28:15.779
Now you know how I've felt
my entire life because of you!

28:15.945 --> 28:19.574
- Shelley, please!
- I hate you!

28:25.705 --> 28:28.041
But I'm not like you.

28:30.502 --> 28:34.130
I may look like one, but you've
always been the real monster.

28:34.297 --> 28:36.049
Remove Mrs Godfrey
from the premises.

28:36.216 --> 28:37.592
And you'd better make sure

28:37.759 --> 28:40.178
this is the last time I see her
in this building again.

28:40.345 --> 28:42.597
You're done,
you little shit-stain!

28:42.764 --> 28:45.183
It's all gonna come
crashing down!

28:59.572 --> 29:01.783
Over here.
It's coming from here.

29:01.950 --> 29:03.576
Arggh!

29:03.743 --> 29:05.578
Shit, what the hell
is going on?

29:05.745 --> 29:07.622
Nothing good.

29:16.005 --> 29:17.424
Hey.

29:18.425 --> 29:21.928
- Ugh!
- Hey. We're here to help, OK?

29:22.095 --> 29:23.721
We're gonna help you.

29:24.806 --> 29:27.559
- Come on.
- Arggh!

29:29.144 --> 29:31.062
Pull him out,
you'll rip his skin off.

29:35.650 --> 29:38.445
The thing that brought you here,
where is he?

29:40.613 --> 29:42.866
We're gonna try to get you
out of here.

29:43.032 --> 29:45.618
I can't go. Mustn't go.

29:45.785 --> 29:47.912
He keeps me alive for them.

29:48.079 --> 29:50.165
I am f-food.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.335
Did he have a baby with him?

29:54.502 --> 29:57.881
Egg baby. Eve. Gone now.

29:58.047 --> 29:59.716
So many. All swimming.

29:59.883 --> 30:02.343
- Where is she?
- Poor Eve!

30:02.510 --> 30:04.304
He wants his rib back.

30:07.599 --> 30:09.934
I am real big now.

30:10.101 --> 30:12.187
It hurts so bad!

30:12.353 --> 30:14.230
Tell me where the fuck she is!

30:14.397 --> 30:17.442
Adam! With Adam.
Eve's with Adam.

30:17.609 --> 30:19.986
Gave her the apple.
She's mother.

30:20.153 --> 30:22.071
I am having the babies.

30:22.238 --> 30:24.824
I am food for them.

30:24.991 --> 30:27.827
Eve is food for Adam.

30:28.828 --> 30:30.038
Sausage.

30:30.205 --> 30:32.499
Ugh! Ugh!

30:32.665 --> 30:34.876
Ugh!

30:35.043 --> 30:38.296
Arggh!

30:43.301 --> 30:45.345
Ah, the miracle
of birth.

30:45.512 --> 30:48.223
Is there anything more
beautiful? Hello, boys!

30:50.850 --> 30:53.937
Persistent little buggers,
aren't you? Good for you!

30:54.103 --> 30:56.523
Good for you!

30:56.689 --> 30:58.942
It's Peter, right?

30:59.108 --> 31:00.985
I don't think we've been
properly introduced.

31:01.152 --> 31:03.988
Government's name is Arnold
Spivak. You can call me, uh...

31:04.155 --> 31:06.324
Oh, it doesn't matter.

31:06.491 --> 31:10.036
Miranda spoke very highly
of you.

31:10.203 --> 31:11.663
Both of you, actually.

31:11.829 --> 31:14.290
no matter how hard
I prodded her - and boy, did I -

31:14.457 --> 31:17.710
I could never get her to pick
a favourite between you two.

31:17.877 --> 31:20.213
So, I would love

31:20.380 --> 31:22.507
to introduce you to the family.

31:23.758 --> 31:26.970
Roman, alright, couldn't have
done this without you.

31:27.971 --> 31:30.223
Well, more specifically,
you know,

31:30.390 --> 31:32.475
you and that Godfrey
blood line of yours.

31:32.642 --> 31:34.602
Holy mackinaw.

31:35.603 --> 31:37.272
All its beautiful mutations.

31:37.438 --> 31:39.566
You know, 2,000 years
of nurturing.

31:39.732 --> 31:43.319
I gave it some tweaks along
the way, but finally a miracle.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.531
Letha. It was you.

31:46.698 --> 31:48.366
- You made her pregnant.
- Well, listen.

31:48.533 --> 31:50.201
I may have wings,
but I'm no angel, alright?

31:50.368 --> 31:51.786
But I would have enjoyed...

31:51.953 --> 31:53.413
Where's Nadia?

31:55.540 --> 31:57.458
Such wonder.

31:57.625 --> 32:01.254
Such magnificence all around
you as the life force is reborn

32:01.421 --> 32:02.880
to restore order
and maintenance,

32:03.047 --> 32:06.301
rescue our fair sister Earth
from a thug species

32:06.467 --> 32:09.095
that beats, plunders, slashes,
and ass-rapes her daily.

32:09.262 --> 32:11.014
You're beholding
that which will return her

32:11.180 --> 32:12.515
to her pristine fecundity,

32:12.682 --> 32:14.892
and all you can think to say is,
"Where's Nadia?"

32:15.059 --> 32:16.853
Answer the fucking question.

32:17.020 --> 32:18.646
This is the new Eden.

32:18.813 --> 32:21.482
I'm the new Adam, calling
his people back from the dead.

32:21.649 --> 32:23.318
What the fuck
are you talking about?

32:23.484 --> 32:25.445
Today's an official holiday.

32:25.612 --> 32:29.115
She'll be transmuted into flesh
of my flesh, blood of my blood.

32:29.282 --> 32:32.410
She's being prepared for
the feast. I'm gonna eat.

32:32.577 --> 32:34.871
Enough! Tell me where she is.

32:35.038 --> 32:36.748
You'll be gone soon.

32:37.749 --> 32:39.292
Wolven too.

32:39.459 --> 32:41.461
Humans belong to us.

32:41.628 --> 32:43.463
No more competing for food.

32:43.630 --> 32:45.006
Tell me.

32:46.257 --> 32:48.885
Or what?

32:49.052 --> 32:50.845
We'll kill them all.

32:51.012 --> 32:52.555
Do it!

32:54.015 --> 32:56.309
No! No!

33:29.550 --> 33:31.052
Don't fucking move!

33:31.219 --> 33:33.513
What did you do with her?

33:33.680 --> 33:35.682
You dim-witted fruit bat.

33:35.848 --> 33:38.226
You've got no idea
what I've had to endure.

34:49.964 --> 34:53.176
Oh, you're safe. You're safe.

34:57.305 --> 34:58.973
I've missed you so much.

34:59.140 --> 35:01.184
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

35:05.146 --> 35:06.314
Mm-hm.

35:09.942 --> 35:11.235
Dr Pryce?

35:11.402 --> 35:12.987
If I came barging
into your bedroom,

35:13.154 --> 35:15.531
all moist and beady-eyed,

35:15.698 --> 35:18.451
while you were begging for
sexual favours from Mrs Blinsky,

35:18.618 --> 35:20.620
would you consider yourself
ill-used?

35:20.787 --> 35:23.372
- I'm sorry, sir, but...
- I think you would.

35:23.539 --> 35:25.333
And you'd be perfectly justified
in feeling that way,

35:25.500 --> 35:27.001
as I do now.

35:27.168 --> 35:28.628
There's a disturbance
in the lobby.

35:28.795 --> 35:30.421
Then call security.

35:30.588 --> 35:31.923
It's the Greek gentleman

35:32.089 --> 35:33.800
you performed
the transfer experiment on.

35:33.966 --> 35:35.343
He's having a medical emergency

35:35.510 --> 35:37.136
and refuses to see anyone
but you.

35:37.303 --> 35:39.472
I wasn't sure
how you wanted to handle it.

35:40.473 --> 35:42.183
Delicately.

35:42.350 --> 35:44.727
- I can have him removed.
- No.

35:45.812 --> 35:48.189
No. Bring him down to the lab.

35:49.774 --> 35:51.901
I'll be right there.

36:00.159 --> 36:01.869
<i>- Hi.</i>
- I'm running a little bit late.

36:02.036 --> 36:04.580
Would you hate me
if I asked you to meet me here?

36:04.747 --> 36:06.332
<i>I guess that would be OK.</i>

36:06.499 --> 36:09.168
I can give you the tour. I think
you'll be very impressed.

36:09.335 --> 36:10.837
<i>Sounds great, Johann.</i>

36:11.003 --> 36:12.630
- You're a darling!
<i>- 'Bye.</i>

36:19.971 --> 36:22.765
And these voices you're hearing,
what are they saying to you?

36:24.058 --> 36:27.562
Not many voices. Just one.

36:28.688 --> 36:30.815
Then pain in head starts.

36:30.982 --> 36:32.817
Everything turn black.

36:32.984 --> 36:36.279
When I wake, I know awful things
I have done

36:36.445 --> 36:38.197
I will find.

36:38.364 --> 36:41.242
What kind of things?

36:42.243 --> 36:44.829
Last night, I find cat

36:44.996 --> 36:47.039
nailed to table in kitchen.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.585
Head is cut off. Stomach open.

36:50.751 --> 36:52.879
All insides in jars.

36:53.045 --> 36:54.964
I can't believe.

36:55.131 --> 36:58.092
I think,
"Who has done such evil?"

36:58.259 --> 37:00.761
Then I find blood on my shirt,
and I know.

37:03.848 --> 37:06.142
What is broken with me?

37:08.394 --> 37:10.563
Whatever it is,
I'm going to fix it.

37:10.730 --> 37:12.315
You have my word.

37:13.316 --> 37:15.943
Oh! Oh!

37:16.110 --> 37:17.570
Ugh!

37:26.704 --> 37:28.039
Impostor.

37:28.205 --> 37:31.542
You prance around my laboratory,
pretending to be me.

37:31.709 --> 37:33.502
You're a spy. Admit it.

37:33.669 --> 37:35.254
I need you to calm down,
Johann.

37:35.421 --> 37:37.924
You're experiencing
neural pathway dysphoria.

37:38.090 --> 37:40.009
Tell me who you're working for.

37:40.176 --> 37:41.636
The synaptic pairings
are degenerating.

37:41.802 --> 37:43.888
We can control it with
serotonin, but I need you...

37:44.055 --> 37:46.057
Where did this Gustav
tell you to make the drop?

37:46.223 --> 37:48.100
He's working for the Chinese,
no doubt.

37:48.267 --> 37:49.936
Johann, you need to listen to me
very carefully.

37:50.102 --> 37:51.604
I need you to concentrate.
Our consciousness is...

37:51.771 --> 37:53.397
Corrupted.

37:55.566 --> 37:57.777
In order to prevent it
from decompensating further,

37:57.944 --> 38:00.154
a cranial implant...

38:01.864 --> 38:03.449
Don't think I don't know
what you're doing.

38:03.616 --> 38:06.786
You want me dead
so you take credit for my work.

38:06.953 --> 38:10.581
Steal the glory for yourself
for accomplishments

38:10.748 --> 38:12.458
your second-rate mind
could never conceive of.

38:13.459 --> 38:17.046
Commodum ex injuria
sua nemo habere debet.

38:18.047 --> 38:19.507
Ugh!

38:22.051 --> 38:25.721
No-one should have advantage
from his own wrong.

38:31.227 --> 38:33.980
Ugh!

38:34.146 --> 38:35.690
Ugh!

38:41.153 --> 38:42.655
Uncle Johann?

38:50.997 --> 38:52.665
Oh, my.

38:54.166 --> 38:56.752
Help! We need help!

38:57.753 --> 38:59.463
Dr Blinsky!

38:59.630 --> 39:01.674
Someone, please!

39:02.675 --> 39:06.095
Anybody. Please.
How do I make it stop?

39:06.262 --> 39:09.140
The location of the wound...

39:10.558 --> 39:13.811
The blood flow,
the abdominal aorta...

39:15.521 --> 39:19.066
- There's nothing to be done.
- No. Uncle Johann...

39:19.233 --> 39:20.985
It's alright, sweetheart.

39:21.986 --> 39:23.654
It's alright.

39:23.821 --> 39:26.657
There's got to be something.
Tell me what to do.

39:26.824 --> 39:29.035
A small favour.

39:47.344 --> 39:48.637
Uh.

39:50.264 --> 39:51.474
It's...

39:52.892 --> 39:54.560
..so...

40:57.790 --> 41:00.543
Could you let Johann Pryce
know that Randolph is here?

41:00.709 --> 41:03.129
Please have a seat.

41:32.533 --> 41:34.827
I have a BA in child studies

41:34.994 --> 41:36.745
and a master's
in family counselling.

41:36.912 --> 41:39.665
- Impressive.
- Inevitable, really.

41:39.832 --> 41:43.377
Dad left right after I was born,
Mom worked three jobs

41:43.544 --> 41:45.296
and I raised two brothers.

41:45.462 --> 41:46.839
I love kids,

41:47.006 --> 41:49.508
and they always say
you should do what you love,

41:49.675 --> 41:52.178
so this is what I do.

41:53.637 --> 41:57.683
To be very clear, um,
discretion is a primary concern.

41:57.850 --> 42:01.270
I'm happy to sign
a confidentiality agreement.

42:01.437 --> 42:04.231
I worked as a nanny for some
extremely high-profile people,

42:04.398 --> 42:06.609
so I know the drill.

42:08.360 --> 42:10.029
Alright then.
When can you start?

42:10.196 --> 42:11.655
You tell me.

42:11.822 --> 42:13.574
I'll have a room ready for you
this afternoon.

42:13.741 --> 42:16.327
- 4:00?
- Sounds good.

42:16.493 --> 42:18.829
I'll see you then.

42:18.996 --> 42:21.373
- Thank you, Mr Godfrey.
- Roman.

42:29.173 --> 42:30.591
- 'Bye for now.
- 'Bye.

42:32.426 --> 42:35.137
Is her job looking after Nadia
or breastfeeding you?

42:35.304 --> 42:38.390
I just want what's best for the kid.
She has a master's degree.

42:38.557 --> 42:41.852
- How is Nadia?
- She's still sleeping.

42:42.019 --> 42:43.687
I'll feed her when she wakes up.

42:43.854 --> 42:45.731
Are you sure you want to bring
another stranger

42:45.898 --> 42:47.358
into this house?

42:47.524 --> 42:50.361
We're not gonna be able to keep
our eyes on her 24/7, Peter.

42:50.527 --> 42:52.529
What are we supposed to do now?

42:52.696 --> 42:54.990
Just move on
like nothing happened?

42:55.991 --> 42:58.744
A lot of unimaginable,
awful shit went down,

42:58.911 --> 43:01.956
but it's where it belongs,
in the past.

43:03.916 --> 43:05.459
Yeah, well,
if you find the reset button

43:05.626 --> 43:07.878
that turns off the pain,
let me know where it is.

43:26.647 --> 43:27.898
Peter.

43:30.401 --> 43:32.444
I thought you left town.

43:34.029 --> 43:36.156
I needed to speak to you first.

43:37.157 --> 43:39.243
Because you deserve
to know the truth.

43:39.410 --> 43:41.996
Whatever went down between
you and Roman isn't my business.

43:42.162 --> 43:43.872
He killed your cousin.

43:46.458 --> 43:48.168
What?

43:48.335 --> 43:50.713
Destiny came to the house,
looking for you.

43:50.879 --> 43:53.507
She was very upset.

43:53.674 --> 43:56.427
Started saying a lot of shit,

43:56.593 --> 43:59.388
accusing him of being involved
in her fiancÃ©'s death,

43:59.555 --> 44:01.974
and it got out of control.

44:02.141 --> 44:03.892
He hit her.

44:04.059 --> 44:05.853
She fell and cracked her head.

44:07.271 --> 44:09.440
It was bad,
but she was still alive.

44:09.606 --> 44:12.318
But he knew
you'd never forgive him, so...

44:13.319 --> 44:14.903
He broke her neck

44:15.070 --> 44:17.740
and buried her in the woods

44:17.906 --> 44:19.992
to make the whole thing
just go away.

44:20.159 --> 44:22.453
Why would you tell me that?

44:22.619 --> 44:25.622
What the fuck is wrong with you?

44:25.789 --> 44:27.541
Because that's what happened.

44:27.708 --> 44:29.418
I don't know what your sick
fucking agenda is,

44:29.585 --> 44:31.795
but I know who killed Destiny,
and he's been dealt with.

44:33.047 --> 44:36.633
Then whatever revenge you took
was on the wrong person.

44:36.800 --> 44:38.552
You're lying.

44:38.719 --> 44:41.847
How would I know you handed over
Andreas to prevent a gang war?

44:42.848 --> 44:45.434
How would I know that Destiny
was suspicious of the 911 call?

44:45.601 --> 44:47.811
You were fucking Roman,
and he was running his mouth...

44:47.978 --> 44:50.105
How would I know about the cross
on Destiny's forehead?

44:50.272 --> 44:52.399
Tell me, Peter.

44:52.566 --> 44:55.027
Because I watched him kill her,

44:55.194 --> 44:58.906
and I made that cross
with Destiny's blood...

44:59.948 --> 45:03.243
..because there was nothing
I could do to stop him.

45:07.122 --> 45:09.333
And he made me promise
never to tell you.

45:43.242 --> 45:47.788
I didn't want to believe
he was capable of such cruelty,

45:47.955 --> 45:51.125
but that's who Roman Godfrey is.

45:52.126 --> 45:54.711
He destroys every life
he touches.

45:54.878 --> 45:58.090
I can't allow him
to go on doing that.

45:59.508 --> 46:01.510
What are you gonna do about it?

46:03.804 --> 46:05.681
Kill him.

46:06.682 --> 46:08.684
No, you can't do that.

46:10.144 --> 46:12.146
Atonement comes in all shapes
and sizes.

46:12.312 --> 46:13.313
No.

46:15.065 --> 46:17.943
It should be me. I'm his friend.

46:18.110 --> 46:20.571
I'll do it.
He won't see it coming.

46:26.660 --> 46:29.204
Then you're going to need these.

46:34.668 --> 46:37.087
The bullets are tipped
with heparin.

46:38.088 --> 46:40.174
Two shots to the head
will put him down long enough

46:40.340 --> 46:41.758
to finish him off.

46:41.925 --> 46:44.094
What's the knife for?

46:45.095 --> 46:47.097
You have to cut out his heart.

46:48.432 --> 46:51.727
That's the only way
to make certain an upir dies.

47:02.779 --> 47:04.490
There's a Gypsy camp in Munhall.

47:05.824 --> 47:07.493
Tell them I sent you.

47:08.494 --> 47:09.995
Take Nadia.

47:10.162 --> 47:12.372
You two will be safe there.

47:14.875 --> 47:17.419
I'll call you when it's done.

47:43.320 --> 47:45.572
How do I know
you're not a cop?

47:51.161 --> 47:52.913
I can work with that.

48:03.048 --> 48:04.550
I don't kiss.

48:04.716 --> 48:06.760
Save that for another girl.

48:59.688 --> 49:01.857
How did you find out?

49:02.983 --> 49:04.568
It was Annie, wasn't it?

49:06.987 --> 49:09.364
Fuck you.
