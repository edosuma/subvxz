♪

01:58.417 --> 02:00.485
They're in.

02:27.777 --> 02:30.746
And in retrospect,
city officials regret holding

02:30.780 --> 02:33.615
the gang truce negotiations
at Santa's Village.

02:33.650 --> 02:35.284
In other news,
we're about to go live

02:35.318 --> 02:37.469
to Mr. Burns' announcement
of his annual rate hike.

02:37.504 --> 02:39.304
Springfielders are about
to find out how much

02:39.339 --> 02:42.174
their electricity bills
will go up.

02:42.208 --> 02:46.178
I'm being told that Mr. Burns
is approaching the lectern now.

02:46.212 --> 02:49.581
Apparently there are a few
stairs he's struggling to climb.

02:49.616 --> 02:53.619
He's up the stairs but is now
being buffeted by the breeze.

02:53.653 --> 02:56.288
And they've put
some rocks in his pocket and...

02:56.322 --> 02:58.323
we're ready to go.

02:59.626 --> 03:02.111
To decide how much your
electricity bills will rise,

03:02.145 --> 03:05.180
I've assembled a team
of distinguished economists

03:05.215 --> 03:08.701
and placed plausible rate hike
percentages on their backs.

03:08.735 --> 03:11.820
Now we will use unfettered
free market principles

03:11.855 --> 03:13.555
to arrive at a number.

03:13.590 --> 03:15.457
Release the hounds.

03:19.879 --> 03:22.281
Notice how the
Keynesians climb trees

03:22.315 --> 03:25.134
while the Austrian school
economists hide under rocks.

03:25.168 --> 03:26.401
That is
fascinating.

03:31.574 --> 03:33.976
And there you have it,
folks, rates will rise

03:34.010 --> 03:35.377
a healthy 17%.

03:35.412 --> 03:37.179
And now, to help you disperse...

03:37.213 --> 03:40.315
Let me guess, you're going
to release the hounds again.

03:40.350 --> 03:41.483
Oh, don't be silly.

03:41.518 --> 03:44.119
Release the radioactive steam.

03:46.856 --> 03:49.391
Electricity costs
are going up 17%.

03:49.426 --> 03:51.477
This station can't afford that.

03:51.528 --> 03:53.929
We're barely keeping
the lights on as it is.

03:53.947 --> 03:55.197
I know it's a
kid's show,

03:55.231 --> 03:56.365
but I got to
see you topless.

03:56.399 --> 03:58.534
This isn't
your dressing room.

03:58.568 --> 04:00.335
I know, but the
monkey's got a girl

04:00.370 --> 04:02.871
in <i>my</i> dressing room.

04:02.906 --> 04:06.341
The decision to pull
the plug is never easy.

04:06.376 --> 04:08.911
Particularly with
the 17% rate hike.

04:08.945 --> 04:10.746
Do I get a vote?

04:10.780 --> 04:13.949
That's just air
escaping his lungs.

04:18.120 --> 04:22.191
Oh, I guess we'll be peeling
our shrimp by hand this year.

04:22.225 --> 04:24.259
We can keep the shrimp
de-veiner, though, right?

04:24.294 --> 04:25.561
I'm afraid not.

04:27.447 --> 04:29.331
And this goes, too.

04:30.950 --> 04:33.452
When I found out
shrimp cocktails had no alcohol,

04:33.486 --> 04:34.987
I really lost interest.

04:36.289 --> 04:37.756
Children,
we can no longer afford

04:37.791 --> 04:39.625
to use anything electric.

04:39.659 --> 04:42.694
However, we will still be able
to watch today's film,

04:42.729 --> 04:45.114
thanks to the magic
of potato power.

04:51.320 --> 04:54.990
<i>Sometimes Y:</i> the story

04:58.328 --> 05:01.497
Emergency meeting in the
faculty lounge. BYOB.

05:01.531 --> 05:03.715
Well, class,
I don't mind leaving you,

05:03.750 --> 05:06.301
because one of you is my spy.

05:06.336 --> 05:09.071
You said
you weren't going to tell.

05:09.105 --> 05:11.306
Oh, wait, you didn't.

05:11.341 --> 05:15.477
So no one knows
who the Milhouse is.

05:17.013 --> 05:18.280
The school is broke.

05:18.314 --> 05:20.582
I had to sell
all the trombone mutes.

05:22.218 --> 05:23.852
Why did I sell one to Nelson?

05:25.455 --> 05:26.955
Hmm. Sounds better than
half the kids in the band.

05:26.990 --> 05:28.757
So does a leaf blower.

05:28.791 --> 05:31.760
Look, the district can't afford
to keep every school open,

05:31.794 --> 05:34.830
so all the kids will take
a standardized test.

05:34.864 --> 05:37.833
Whichever school scores the
lowest will be closed forever.

05:37.867 --> 05:39.918
So you're saying, if our kids
don't pass this test,

05:39.953 --> 05:42.154
you're shutting down
Springfield Elementary?

05:42.188 --> 05:44.590
I don't teach to the test.
I teach 'em to dodge balls.

05:44.624 --> 05:46.024
Things they can use in life.

05:46.059 --> 05:47.025
How is that useful?

05:47.060 --> 05:48.143
Ow.

05:48.178 --> 05:50.279
We all came here
to avoid scrutiny.

05:50.313 --> 05:51.847
Who else would
hire a lunch lady

05:51.881 --> 05:53.682
accused of poisoning
her husband?

05:53.716 --> 05:54.683
Never convicted.

05:54.717 --> 05:56.151
They couldn't
find the body.

05:56.186 --> 05:58.487
Anyone care for some
chicken-Pete pie?

05:58.521 --> 06:00.989
Did you say "chicken-Pete pie"?

06:01.024 --> 06:02.491
His friends called him Pete.

06:06.996 --> 06:09.331
Good-bye, my electrical friends.

06:09.365 --> 06:12.017
I can't afford to use you,
so I'm doing what any good

06:12.051 --> 06:14.303
American would do:
throw you away.

06:18.574 --> 06:21.476
And it still works.

06:21.511 --> 06:23.679
This could come in handy.

06:23.713 --> 06:26.348
Ah, ah, ah, but let me check
that list of things

06:26.382 --> 06:28.517
Marge said never to bring home.

06:28.551 --> 06:33.722
Dogs, cats, octopuses,
octopi, octopuseseseses.

06:33.756 --> 06:36.992
Parking meter,
you're working for me now.

06:37.026 --> 06:39.928
Mannequin heads,
you're working for me now.

06:39.963 --> 06:41.630
Lot of people at the dump today.

06:53.576 --> 06:55.577
The proctors
are here.

06:55.612 --> 06:57.579
Their leader seems
to be a woman.

06:57.614 --> 06:59.248
Catalog poses.

07:30.647 --> 07:33.582
When will they finish
grading those tests?

07:33.616 --> 07:36.385
I hate waiting; that's
why I hate risotto.

07:36.419 --> 07:37.619
Even mushroom
risotto?

07:37.654 --> 07:39.121
What do you think?!

07:39.155 --> 07:40.455
So...

07:40.490 --> 07:42.090
...how'd we do?

07:42.125 --> 07:44.543
Not as bad as the worst school
in the state.

07:44.577 --> 07:45.911
Oh, thank God.

07:45.945 --> 07:48.613
You did <i>worse</i> than the
worst school in the state,

07:48.648 --> 07:49.881
which now makes
this school

07:49.916 --> 07:51.717
the worst school
in the state.

07:51.751 --> 07:53.952
Why did you say that to us
in the meanest way you could?

07:53.987 --> 07:56.905
To show you
that there's no way out.

07:56.939 --> 07:58.974
Except...
Except what?

07:59.008 --> 08:01.243
No, I meant you should
<i>accept</i> your terrible fate.

08:01.277 --> 08:02.978
Oh.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.455
This place
is worse

08:09.489 --> 08:11.390
than the elementary
school in prison.

08:11.424 --> 08:14.510
This student filled in
everything <i>but</i> the ovals.

08:14.544 --> 08:15.978
In art school
he'd be a genius.

08:16.012 --> 08:17.179
This isn't an art school.

08:17.213 --> 08:19.314
We tried to have ourselves
accredited as one,

08:19.349 --> 08:21.817
but no one here could,
uh, draw the pirate.

08:21.851 --> 08:23.185
Children, Groundskeeper Willie
will direct you

08:23.219 --> 08:24.720
to your new school district.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.523
Any correlation to your talents,
needs, or friends

08:27.557 --> 08:29.658
is completely coincidental.

08:29.692 --> 08:32.160
Sherri, you're going
to West Ogdenville.

08:32.195 --> 08:33.962
Terri, North Haverbrook.

08:33.996 --> 08:36.581
But we've never
been separated.

08:36.599 --> 08:39.351
I'm not sure
we can even live apart.

08:43.590 --> 08:44.990
Stop your whinging.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.993
It's not like you're losing
a rake or a backhoe.

08:48.027 --> 08:51.063
Nelson, you're off to
Arkham Elementary School

08:51.097 --> 08:53.098
for the
Criminally Insane.

08:58.605 --> 09:00.739
Well, I'm glad
you're not upset.

09:00.773 --> 09:02.824
All my extra credit
points are like

09:02.876 --> 09:05.561
frequent flyer miles
on a bankrupt airline.

09:05.595 --> 09:08.330
Hey, don't blame me.
I didn't even take the test.

09:08.364 --> 09:09.531
You didn't?

09:09.566 --> 09:11.433
Is there no limit
to your disrespect?

09:11.467 --> 09:13.135
Eh, I had
something better to do.

09:26.632 --> 09:29.468
Driving you crazy instead
of pulling off your legs.

09:29.502 --> 09:31.703
I've really matured.

09:31.738 --> 09:33.772
Wait a minute.

09:33.806 --> 09:35.924
If you take the test now,
your score could raise

09:35.959 --> 09:39.745
the average
and save the school.

09:39.779 --> 09:43.699
Proctor Clarkson, one student
still hasn't taken the test.

09:43.733 --> 09:46.485
Let it be Martin,
let it be Martin.

09:46.519 --> 09:47.319
It's Bart.

09:48.988 --> 09:50.422
I have an aunt named Hope.

09:50.456 --> 09:52.257
Perhaps you'd like
to kill her as well.

09:53.459 --> 09:54.826
Bart will
take his exam

09:54.861 --> 09:56.728
first thing
tomorrow morning.

09:56.763 --> 09:59.831
Bart, I'm begging you
to try and study.

09:59.866 --> 10:02.668
When I think begging, I don't
imagine someone standing up.

10:02.702 --> 10:04.753
Sorry, I can't
grant a favor

10:04.787 --> 10:06.772
to someone I don't
respect anymore.

10:06.806 --> 10:09.241
You can spin in my chair!

10:09.275 --> 10:11.260
Whee!

10:11.294 --> 10:13.528
Spinner!
Slow down.

10:22.272 --> 10:24.406
Well, sure the Lord wouldn't
have placed his meter there

10:24.440 --> 10:26.308
if he didn't want me to park.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.514
This is the easiest money
I've ever made.

10:32.548 --> 10:35.150
Lugging around
a 90-pound parking meter.

10:39.155 --> 10:40.956
It's not
that kind.

10:45.895 --> 10:49.798
All right, now to drag
the meter to the next idiot.

10:49.832 --> 10:52.034
Oh, God, my back.

10:53.569 --> 10:54.536
Suckers.

10:54.570 --> 10:57.773
Oh, my disks are grinding.

Washingtons won't solve.

I'm a kid you've never seen,

12:00.269 --> 12:01.553
the kids you've

12:03.056 --> 12:05.457
Do it, man, or you'll
never see us again.

12:07.477 --> 12:11.113
Principal Skinner, could you help me
sharpen this pencil?

12:11.147 --> 12:13.615
I guess a little circular
grinding might relax me.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.718
I can't do this.
I'm not ready.

12:16.753 --> 12:18.086
You really didn't study?

12:18.121 --> 12:19.955
Well, I slept
on my books,

12:19.989 --> 12:21.757
so I might have gotten
something through osmosis.

12:21.791 --> 12:23.759
So, you know what osmosis is?

12:23.793 --> 12:25.627
Uh, pajamas?

12:25.661 --> 12:27.896
Let me make this crystal
clear to you, Simpson.

12:27.930 --> 12:29.631
If you don't
pass this test,

12:29.665 --> 12:31.733
it will destroy the school.

12:44.295 --> 12:47.597
Our entire school riding on
that coffee can head of yours.

12:47.631 --> 12:49.499
We've got to get you
more time to study.

12:49.533 --> 12:50.533
But how?

12:51.735 --> 12:53.369
Pull the fire alarm.

12:53.404 --> 12:55.071
I'd do it,
but everyone's looking at me.

12:59.276 --> 13:02.178
What to do, what to do?

13:02.212 --> 13:03.513
Don't do it, Seymour.

13:03.547 --> 13:05.915
You've never broken
school rules. Ever.

13:05.949 --> 13:07.083
You wimp.

13:12.256 --> 13:14.641
Children, remain calm,
find your disaster buddy,

13:14.675 --> 13:16.409
which is different
from your lab partner

13:16.443 --> 13:18.261
but may be the same
as your lunchroom buddy.

13:18.295 --> 13:20.313
Well, well, well...

13:21.765 --> 13:24.984
Looks like Mr. Vanilla
just grew some chocolate chips.

13:25.002 --> 13:28.538
Save your analogies for the
analogy portion of the exam.

13:28.589 --> 13:30.206
I bought you time, boy.
Don't blow it.

13:30.257 --> 13:31.758
I won't.

13:31.792 --> 13:34.460
I'm going to ignore everything
else on my schedule.

13:35.746 --> 13:38.498
Pass this test
and the eggs are on me.

13:38.532 --> 13:41.417
They will be, Seymour.
They will be.

13:45.689 --> 13:47.657
I'm king of the bus station.

13:49.426 --> 13:51.594
Meter, meter,
quarter cheater?

13:51.628 --> 13:54.330
A rogue parking meter has been
terrorizing the streets.

13:54.365 --> 13:57.633
Experts estimate the cost
to taxpayers at north of $50.

13:57.668 --> 13:59.152
That's right, Kent.

13:59.186 --> 14:01.120
The entire force is on
the lookout for anyone

14:01.155 --> 14:03.172
with an excessive
amount of change.

14:04.208 --> 14:06.175
Our top criminologists
have a theory

14:06.210 --> 14:08.778
as to what the suspect
just might look like.

14:08.812 --> 14:10.680
But, of course,
that question mark could be

14:10.714 --> 14:12.415
an exclamation point
or an interrobang.

14:12.449 --> 14:15.852
And the man or woman
could be Hispanic or,

14:15.886 --> 14:20.156
most frightening,
contain no punctuation at all.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.768
So, how's the studying going?

14:31.802 --> 14:33.069
When I start I'll tell you.

14:34.905 --> 14:37.273
This is the most selfish
thing you've ever done.

14:37.324 --> 14:39.859
You're letting your friends
go hang because you

14:39.893 --> 14:43.529
are lazy and selfish and, hey,
are you falling asleep

14:43.564 --> 14:44.897
just to spite me?

14:53.240 --> 14:54.624
Hey, why aren't
you eating that?

14:54.658 --> 14:57.026
There's four of us
and eight slices.

14:57.060 --> 14:58.795
We don't know how
to divide it.

14:58.846 --> 15:02.982
Something Stu forgot
the music he loves.

15:03.016 --> 15:07.086
Mrs. Krabappel?
Are you a teacher of the night?

15:07.121 --> 15:08.855
Ha, I wish I
was a hooker.

15:08.889 --> 15:10.723
No one in this town
has any money.

15:10.758 --> 15:13.025
But the worst thing is what's
happened to the school.

15:13.060 --> 15:15.378
No, no!

15:21.351 --> 15:22.852
What have I done?

15:25.205 --> 15:26.672
Spinach farm, huh?

15:26.707 --> 15:28.841
That's right,
you talk in your sleep.

15:28.876 --> 15:31.410
Lisa, I want to
pass that test.

15:31.445 --> 15:32.945
But I need your help.

15:32.980 --> 15:34.781
I have all sorts of problems:

15:34.815 --> 15:37.049
Lack of attention,
I'm afraid of ovals,

15:37.084 --> 15:38.701
I only know 24 letters.

15:38.735 --> 15:40.419
Don't you fall asleep on me.

15:42.956 --> 15:46.025
Excuse me,
you're that proctor

15:46.059 --> 15:48.528
that's shutting down
my children's school.

15:48.562 --> 15:49.962
I don't shut anything down.

15:49.997 --> 15:51.731
People cut their own heads,

15:51.765 --> 15:53.599
and I just tip 'em
into the basket.

15:53.634 --> 15:57.436
You've been in public education
a long time, haven't you?

16:12.452 --> 16:14.403
Freeze,
Jack Nickel-scum.

16:14.438 --> 16:16.088
Wha...?

16:16.123 --> 16:18.975
You know what they do
to parking meter thieves in prison?

16:19.009 --> 16:20.877
They probably treat 'em
pretty well.

16:20.911 --> 16:24.113
But when you get out, you're
not eligible for jury duty.

16:24.147 --> 16:25.982
Which, again,
sounds pretty good.

16:27.651 --> 16:29.552
Eat silver, copper.

16:29.586 --> 16:30.720
D'oh!

16:35.759 --> 16:36.959
Stay with me, man.

16:36.994 --> 16:38.261
Stay with me.

16:40.964 --> 16:43.232
No, no!

16:43.267 --> 16:46.969
You're the first successful
business I've ever run.

16:48.338 --> 16:49.772
It's hopeless.

16:49.806 --> 16:52.308
I can't make up for ten years
of goofing off in one day.

16:52.342 --> 16:53.976
I need two days.

16:54.011 --> 16:57.013
Look, the thing is,
it's more important to know

16:57.047 --> 16:59.348
how to take a test
than knowing what's on it.

16:59.383 --> 17:00.983
So do the ones you know first.

17:01.018 --> 17:03.286
If you don't know one,
guess "B" and move on.

17:03.320 --> 17:06.789
Now, what is the capital
of Massachusetts?

17:06.823 --> 17:08.523
Uh, "B"?

17:08.559 --> 17:09.659
Very good.

17:17.031 --> 17:20.353
<i>Okay, this is it. Do or die.</i>

17:20.453 --> 17:22.421
D'oh. Will you stop that?

17:25.625 --> 17:28.644
Burly Paper Towels,
Burlyville, Minnesota.

17:28.678 --> 17:30.546
Dear Sir or Madam:

17:30.580 --> 17:34.416
Your paper towel packets
promised 102 sheets of towels.

17:34.451 --> 17:37.419
But I was blessed
to receive 103.

17:37.454 --> 17:39.621
I'm returning
the extra towel, unused...

17:39.656 --> 17:41.924
Hmm?

17:41.958 --> 17:45.060
A pillow case full
of quarters?

17:45.095 --> 17:46.895
Where did you get
that money?

17:46.930 --> 17:48.897
And what have you done
with the pillows?

17:48.932 --> 17:51.600
The pillows are safe
at my workstation.

17:51.618 --> 17:52.985
As for the quarters, well,

17:53.036 --> 17:55.771
I'm ashamed to tell
you what I did.

17:55.805 --> 17:57.639
How long have
you been in there?

18:01.277 --> 18:03.078
Well, we're going
to turn this change

18:03.113 --> 18:04.630
into change for the better.

18:04.664 --> 18:05.647
Whoo-hoo!

18:05.682 --> 18:08.183
And I wish that Mr. Teeny
gets a banana,

18:08.218 --> 18:09.819
that the Isotopes emerge
from this season

18:09.853 --> 18:11.086
with a great blooper reel.

18:11.121 --> 18:12.754
I wish that
wishing wells worked

18:12.789 --> 18:15.908
so I wasn't tossing
my money away

18:15.942 --> 18:17.910
and that Marge
loves me forever

18:17.944 --> 18:22.147
no matter what
stupid things I do.

18:24.968 --> 18:28.670
And I hope Bart passes his
test and saves the school.

18:28.705 --> 18:31.306
Way to get us back
on topic, Marge.

18:37.347 --> 18:40.015
If you have to
guess, guess "B."

18:41.351 --> 18:44.720
Not every
question!

18:44.754 --> 18:48.557
The second that boy fails,
we're knocking down this school.

18:48.591 --> 18:50.292
Please have
a little faith.

18:50.326 --> 18:51.627
I hear you,
Seymour.

18:51.661 --> 18:53.395
Start the upswing!

18:57.433 --> 19:00.502
The least common blood type is
A) B,

19:00.537 --> 19:03.071
B) A, C) AB,

19:03.106 --> 19:05.691
D) O... d'oh!
Ten more seconds.

19:20.573 --> 19:23.575
And the last
answer, "C."

19:24.611 --> 19:27.512
Is correct.

19:27.547 --> 19:30.532
Congratulations,
you made it by one.

19:30.567 --> 19:32.200
That'll do, bug, that'll do.

19:37.857 --> 19:39.324
He passed.

19:39.359 --> 19:40.375
Stop that ball!

19:42.412 --> 19:44.730
Now your mom can see you
work from her house.

19:44.764 --> 19:46.865
Seymour, stop
slouching!

19:53.940 --> 19:58.343
I'm not sure if you gave
my son any extra help,

19:58.378 --> 20:00.545
but if you did,
thank you.

20:00.580 --> 20:03.615
Perhaps this was
a test of my humanity.

20:03.650 --> 20:06.251
A test I like
to think I passed.

20:06.286 --> 20:10.455
Would you like to have coffee
or dinner, or just talk?

20:10.490 --> 20:13.308
None of the above.

20:13.343 --> 20:15.093
Testward ho!

20:29.025 --> 20:30.792
Is this Wilson
Elementary?

20:30.827 --> 20:32.661
No.
Sorry.

20:40.169 --> 20:45.169
== sync, corrected by <font color="#00ff00">elderman</font> ==

21:26.086 --> 21:28.087
Shh!
