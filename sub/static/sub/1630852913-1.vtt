01:01.253 --> 01:06.325
Oh, Lord on High,
grant me this prayer.

01:06.358 --> 01:10.797
Aid Your most
humble servant

01:10.830 --> 01:15.735
and imbue this water
with Your holy blessing

01:15.768 --> 01:18.136
such that it will
cast away demons...

01:21.373 --> 01:25.545
and weaken the illnesses
afflicting this, Your son.

01:32.685 --> 01:35.655
Keep the homes
of Your faithful

01:35.688 --> 01:39.057
purified
from the presence of evil

01:39.091 --> 01:43.328
and keep at bay all
its filthy trickery.

01:44.764 --> 01:48.400
<i>In nomine Patris, et Filli
et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

01:48.434 --> 01:50.637
Amen.

01:50.670 --> 01:52.170
Thank you, Father.

01:59.144 --> 02:01.447
Ahem.

02:01.481 --> 02:05.117
Today's services
have concluded.

02:05.150 --> 02:07.286
Please, come back
tomorrow.

02:08.721 --> 02:11.256
Tomorrow may be too late,
Father.

02:19.398 --> 02:22.769
Abraham,
the time has come.

02:25.705 --> 02:26.839
Your Reverence...

02:28.575 --> 02:31.276
I was not expecting
to see you again

02:31.310 --> 02:33.880
after so many
years have passed.

02:33.913 --> 02:36.415
I wish the reason for my visit
were more pleasant.

02:40.720 --> 02:45.858
Abraham, something truly
terrible is on the horizon,

02:45.892 --> 02:48.695
an evil like this world
has never seen before.

02:48.728 --> 02:50.329
You know what
I'm referring to.

02:52.599 --> 02:53.800
The signs are everywhere.

03:03.776 --> 03:07.145
Our Lord teaches us that
violence is never the answer.

03:08.448 --> 03:12.217
But the time has come that
even the most holiest of saints

03:12.250 --> 03:13.786
must become executioners.

03:16.522 --> 03:19.692
Abraham, we need your help.

03:34.474 --> 03:36.174
The way is long
and difficult.

03:38.377 --> 03:42.381
But out of hell,
we are led to the light.

03:52.759 --> 03:55.595
We will provide you
with the means

03:55.628 --> 03:56.929
to defeat
the coming darkness.

03:58.330 --> 04:00.265
You will not be alone

04:00.298 --> 04:01.834
as you walk
through the dark valley.

04:08.808 --> 04:11.376
Are you willing
to join us in this fight?

04:11.410 --> 04:12.377
Yes.

04:12.411 --> 04:14.881
Do you have the strength
to make the sacrifices?

04:14.914 --> 04:15.882
Yes.

04:15.915 --> 04:18.985
Do you accept this mission
of violent mercy?

04:19.017 --> 04:21.721
Yes, I accept.

04:35.001 --> 04:37.637
Oh, Eternal one,

04:37.670 --> 04:41.507
give this man the power
to be your sword

04:41.541 --> 04:43.543
and administer your justice.

05:01.694 --> 05:03.629
<i>It's been
weeks since the darkness</i>

05:03.663 --> 05:05.330
<i>has overtaken
the entire continent</i>

05:05.363 --> 05:07.767
<i>and there are no signs
of its ending in sight.</i>

05:07.800 --> 05:10.268
<i>Riots in the streets
continue in every city.</i>

05:13.606 --> 05:15.975
<i>The government encourages
its citizens to stay calm,</i>

05:16.008 --> 05:18.343
<i>even though the death rate
continues to climb.</i>

05:18.376 --> 05:20.378
<i>The president has announced
that over the...</i>

05:20.412 --> 05:23.683
<i>To battle this
evil, you must leave the city.</i>

05:23.716 --> 05:27.520
<i>Escape those places where the
darkness will first descend.</i>

05:27.553 --> 05:31.824
<i>Our faithful will need a guide
and you must be their shepherd.</i>

05:31.858 --> 05:34.861
<i>It is your duty to prepare
them for what is to occur.</i>

05:36.763 --> 05:38.531
<i>May God be with you.</i>

05:40.800 --> 05:43.035
<i>May God be with you.</i>

08:48.688 --> 08:49.956
Let's go.

10:08.334 --> 10:12.605
Well, well, well,
it's about time.

10:35.361 --> 10:36.896
Good day to you, sir.

10:39.765 --> 10:41.233
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

10:42.835 --> 10:43.969
Come on in.

10:54.847 --> 10:56.816
I'd offer you a little
something to drink,

10:56.849 --> 10:59.752
but this piss
isn't fit for guests.

11:01.087 --> 11:03.355
Brought you everything
from your list, Mr. Fallen,

11:03.389 --> 11:05.724
everything except milk.

11:06.692 --> 11:10.129
They were out at the general store
today, but I'll try again tomorrow.

11:12.932 --> 11:14.867
That's all right.

11:14.900 --> 11:16.936
As long as I got
my poison, I'm happy.

11:19.038 --> 11:23.342
Well, I could use a hand
putting all this away.

11:24.844 --> 11:26.078
You bet, sir.

11:41.127 --> 11:42.261
Sir...

11:44.330 --> 11:45.865
how are things today?

11:47.867 --> 11:51.871
Well, not much different from
other days.

11:57.877 --> 11:58.978
Thank you, Thomas.

12:02.781 --> 12:04.884
Don't mention it, sir.

12:04.917 --> 12:07.253
It's the least I can do
to show our gratitude

12:07.286 --> 12:09.822
- for all you've done for our community.
- This.

12:12.057 --> 12:13.325
Over there.

12:30.342 --> 12:34.013
Ah. Goes to the back
of the house.

12:36.148 --> 12:40.085
Hasn't been opened
since... the darkness.

13:01.207 --> 13:02.408
I got wood to chop.

13:04.310 --> 13:05.844
You keep
an eye on her.

13:12.851 --> 13:13.919
Hey, Sarah.

13:58.531 --> 14:00.199
I got a little something.

14:31.531 --> 14:34.199
Well, that looks
really fine on you, Sarah.

14:39.004 --> 14:41.940
Just imagine
if that thing could talk.

14:43.242 --> 14:45.311
All the stories
it would tell.

14:45.344 --> 14:49.214
Maybe it belonged to
a Russian Czar's wife,

14:49.248 --> 14:52.318
or a fancy
French queen.

14:52.351 --> 14:53.819
Now it's all yours.

15:19.144 --> 15:21.146
Let me go fix
something hot for you.

16:05.023 --> 16:07.025
How is Sarah doing?

16:07.059 --> 16:11.631
Gave her something to sleep.
Now she's out like a light.

16:11.664 --> 16:16.001
Well, if there's nothing more I
can do for you, sir, I'll be going.

16:18.036 --> 16:19.104
Son...

16:20.673 --> 16:22.207
you're not
going anywhere.

16:30.382 --> 16:33.919
Mmm. This is
a fine supper, sir.

16:35.053 --> 16:38.525
I haven't eaten that well
since before the darkness.

16:46.499 --> 16:47.700
What's that?

16:52.337 --> 16:56.041
Well, I went out
on a limb this morning

16:56.074 --> 16:59.144
when I was at the general
store, got it for her.

17:03.450 --> 17:05.551
You shouldn't have.

17:05.585 --> 17:07.587
No, sir. It's
no problem at all.

17:17.564 --> 17:20.132
If you don't
mind me saying so, sir,

17:20.165 --> 17:23.234
It's very uncanny how much Sarah's
looking more and more like the missus.

17:26.673 --> 17:28.207
What do you mean?

17:29.809 --> 17:32.044
Well, I was having a look
at the photograph...

17:34.379 --> 17:35.715
over by the gramophone today.

17:36.583 --> 17:38.383
Sarah is spitting image
of your wife.

17:49.429 --> 17:50.663
Actually...

17:52.499 --> 17:54.567
Sarah doesn't look
a thing like her.

17:54.601 --> 17:57.236
- No, sir, I'm telling you...
- But she doesn't!

18:05.612 --> 18:07.614
Sarah never would
have abandoned me.

18:16.154 --> 18:19.692
The rain's let up.
Time for you to leave.

18:42.882 --> 18:46.118
Thanks for supper, sir.
Good night, Sarah.

20:09.636 --> 20:11.571
Mary, Mary.

20:14.239 --> 20:15.842
- No, no, no.
- Mary.

20:15.875 --> 20:17.744
- Stop. No!
- Let me through!

21:12.432 --> 21:15.300
I'm sorry,
she shall live,

21:15.333 --> 21:17.637
but she'll be nothing
but a cripple.

21:17.670 --> 21:20.707
Nothing but a cripple.

21:20.740 --> 21:23.241
Nothing but a cripple.

21:23.275 --> 21:26.713
- Nothing but a cripple.
- Nothing but a cripple.

21:26.746 --> 21:27.947
Nothing but a cripple.

21:36.388 --> 21:38.390
...but a cripple.

21:40.292 --> 21:41.928
Nothing but a cripple.

21:41.961 --> 21:43.730
Nothing but a cripple.

23:04.409 --> 23:05.812
Hey.

23:07.513 --> 23:09.381
Shh.

23:09.414 --> 23:11.349
Hey.

23:59.165 --> 24:03.769
Hey, come here! Come here!

24:47.713 --> 24:52.051
As of tomorrow,
no more visitors.

25:25.785 --> 25:27.920
Just wanted to apologize
for my behavior last night.

25:33.859 --> 25:36.796
I brought you that milk
we were missing

25:36.829 --> 25:41.801
and... there's a token
of my apologies.

25:43.803 --> 25:45.137
A bit of something extra.

25:49.141 --> 25:50.810
I hope you like it.

26:00.619 --> 26:03.556
You do know how to get back
in my good graces, huh?

26:08.561 --> 26:10.296
Where's my usual
welcoming comittee?

26:10.329 --> 26:13.733
Mm, my dog...

26:13.766 --> 26:16.569
Who knows
where he's off to now.

26:16.602 --> 26:20.639
Probably run after a hare
into the woods somewhere.

26:20.673 --> 26:22.742
I was just about
to go looking for him.

26:22.775 --> 26:23.976
Want me to come along?

26:25.144 --> 26:27.847
Ah, that won't
be necessary.

26:29.915 --> 26:31.183
You look
after Sarah for me.

26:33.052 --> 26:34.220
My pleasure, sir.

27:20.032 --> 27:21.167
This one.

27:23.936 --> 27:27.807
This was the music for a picture
show I saw in town when I was little.

27:49.028 --> 27:51.263
I can't remember
the name of it,

27:51.297 --> 27:55.334
but it was the story
of this powerful magic spell

27:55.367 --> 27:58.771
that made this big
clay statue come to life.

28:03.909 --> 28:05.911
I wish you could
tell me what's wrong.

28:09.248 --> 28:13.085
One day, I'm gonna take you far,
far away from all this. You have my word.

28:17.289 --> 28:19.291
Sir, I just don't
know what Sarah...

28:19.325 --> 28:21.093
- Out.
- But sir...

28:21.127 --> 28:24.396
- I said out of this house, now.
- Sir!

28:28.100 --> 28:30.636
Sir, I swear to God,
I didn't do anything. Sir?

28:34.940 --> 28:37.076
What's wrong with you?
Have you gone mad?

28:37.109 --> 28:40.312
Get out of here
and don't you ever come back!

29:04.803 --> 29:06.805
Don't you dare
look at me that way!

30:21.514 --> 30:25.552
I'm going out to check
on the traps before dark falls.

30:25.585 --> 30:27.052
It won't be long.

30:30.889 --> 30:32.057
Sleep well.

34:09.308 --> 34:12.745
My heavenly Father,

34:12.779 --> 34:16.047
I do tremble
at Your mercy,

34:16.081 --> 34:18.083
and beg You to fill me
with Your strength.

34:20.252 --> 34:24.223
May my eternal
faith in You

34:24.255 --> 34:27.527
guide me in this fight
to drive out the evil spirits

34:27.560 --> 34:29.562
who doth torture
this creature.

34:31.129 --> 34:32.665
You, Lord,

34:32.699 --> 34:36.268
who will rain down
Your wrath of fire and fury

34:36.301 --> 34:39.036
on that day of judgment
for all men.

34:41.239 --> 34:42.442
Amen.

35:39.599 --> 35:43.536
Sarah! Sarah! Sarah!

36:10.863 --> 36:13.298
You'll be safe here.
It'll all be okay.

41:51.671 --> 41:53.105
My Sarah...

41:54.807 --> 41:56.876
Are you all right?

42:03.849 --> 42:07.253
We're unsafe up here.

42:07.286 --> 42:09.655
Tonight we'll sleep
downstairs again.

42:26.839 --> 42:28.841
Collect your things
for tonight.

42:51.597 --> 42:52.732
Who's there?!

42:58.037 --> 42:59.705
It's me, Thomas.

43:02.308 --> 43:04.844
Told you to never show
your face back here again.

43:04.877 --> 43:07.246
What's going on?
Why are the doors and windows boarded up?

43:07.279 --> 43:08.180
Where's Sarah?

43:08.214 --> 43:11.217
It's none of your concern.
Get out of here.

43:11.250 --> 43:16.055
I'm not going anywhere until you answer
my questions and I know Sarah's okay!

43:16.088 --> 43:19.625
Just who do you think you're talking
to, you little...?

43:19.658 --> 43:21.894
Sarah! Sarah!

43:26.665 --> 43:28.567
Get out of here.

43:30.269 --> 43:31.570
Sir...

43:33.205 --> 43:34.840
lower that rifle.

43:44.383 --> 43:46.619
Get out of my sight!

43:46.652 --> 43:49.855
Unless you want to end up just
a memory in my prayers tonight.

44:03.035 --> 44:06.338
Ten, nine, eight...

44:06.372 --> 44:08.107
This won't be
the last you'll see of me.

44:08.140 --> 44:09.942
If you think
I'm just going to leave...

44:11.877 --> 44:13.879
Seven, six,

44:15.948 --> 44:17.183
five,

44:17.216 --> 44:18.818
four,

44:18.851 --> 44:20.052
three,

44:20.086 --> 44:21.253
two,

44:21.287 --> 44:22.221
one!

44:34.333 --> 44:35.868
Let's do it.

45:22.414 --> 45:24.116
It's been a long time...

45:25.851 --> 45:28.420
since the two of us
have had a face-to-face.

45:33.993 --> 45:38.330
Now... all of this
is Your will.

45:39.732 --> 45:41.934
I will humbly
accept it as so.

45:43.736 --> 45:47.072
But help me to see
what I've done to wrong You.

45:48.941 --> 45:50.276
Give me a sign.

45:58.851 --> 46:00.186
That's what I thought.

46:58.310 --> 47:01.780
Father, bless this water,

47:01.814 --> 47:08.320
You who ordered the prophet
Elijah to purify water with salt.

47:08.354 --> 47:12.825
Let it be this day
that we're freed from evil

47:12.858 --> 47:16.529
and protected
by Your Holy Spirit.

47:16.563 --> 47:19.432
In Christ's Name, amen.

48:24.897 --> 48:27.900
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey.

48:27.933 --> 48:30.903
My little one, eh?

48:33.339 --> 48:36.942
My brothers and sisters,

48:36.975 --> 48:39.479
we find ourselves
in the midst of trying times.

48:41.180 --> 48:44.149
Now more than ever,

48:44.183 --> 48:46.619
our community
must band together

48:46.653 --> 48:49.188
because the darkness
is coming.

48:51.190 --> 48:53.493
We must unite in strength

48:53.526 --> 48:57.062
and it will be the word
of our Lord that will save us,

48:57.096 --> 48:59.031
you can be sure.

49:01.333 --> 49:05.572
So now let us read
of the Apocalypse

49:05.605 --> 49:08.475
from the scriptures
of St. John.

49:08.508 --> 49:11.511
<i>In nomine Patris, et Filli
et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

49:11.544 --> 49:12.479
Amen.

49:28.093 --> 49:31.296
Father, I just wanted
to thank you again

49:31.330 --> 49:34.900
for rescuing my fathers' soul
from the dark shadows.

49:36.503 --> 49:39.405
He never had another
attack after your help.

49:39.439 --> 49:41.373
You saved his life.

49:41.407 --> 49:43.242
It was hardly my doing.

49:43.275 --> 49:46.111
That's the will of the Lord
you saw,

49:46.145 --> 49:50.483
He who chose to be gracious and
generous with your father that day.

49:53.085 --> 49:56.955
We are not always
able to understand

49:56.989 --> 50:00.660
what our Heavenly Father
has in store for us.

50:00.693 --> 50:02.361
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

50:05.197 --> 50:06.265
Father.

51:17.336 --> 51:19.037
I'm so sorry.

51:24.644 --> 51:25.578
Um...

51:28.347 --> 51:33.218
You have to understand that you're
the most precious thing I have.

51:36.523 --> 51:38.056
You're my little one.

51:42.795 --> 51:47.266
I hope one day
on this...

51:58.545 --> 52:00.212
This will help you sleep.

52:11.591 --> 52:15.360
The vigil watch
arouses a fear...

52:16.663 --> 52:18.665
which keeps awareness
at bay...

52:21.199 --> 52:25.404
just as a mortal sin
drives away sleep.

52:51.396 --> 52:52.599
Sarah.

53:17.757 --> 53:22.462
You know, I haven't made
you your favorite lunch

53:22.495 --> 53:24.497
since before the darkness.

53:39.946 --> 53:44.216
You slept
so deeply last night.

53:44.249 --> 53:45.317
You know,

53:46.552 --> 53:49.254
I think what happened
was no accident.

53:50.556 --> 53:53.526
It was God's intent
to test our faith

53:53.559 --> 53:56.429
like He did with Job
and Abraham before him.

53:57.730 --> 54:01.934
He wanted to punish us
for what we've done.

54:01.968 --> 54:04.169
Shame us for our sins...

54:06.773 --> 54:10.308
and put us on our path
to repentance.

54:13.345 --> 54:14.881
And you repented?

56:07.894 --> 56:09.427
Abraham...

56:11.396 --> 56:13.766
What in the world
is going on here?

56:15.367 --> 56:16.702
We need to talk.

56:21.007 --> 56:23.341
There are truths
we need now speak.

56:32.852 --> 56:35.021
You have nothing
to say for yourself?

56:39.091 --> 56:40.960
Then I will be
the first to begin.

56:43.830 --> 56:45.397
Have I ever told you
how it came to be

56:45.431 --> 56:48.034
that I dedicated my life
to our Lord?

56:51.804 --> 56:54.640
It all began
when I was a small boy,

56:54.674 --> 56:56.341
right about Sarah's age.

56:57.210 --> 57:02.148
My father would close me up
in the cellar

57:02.181 --> 57:05.551
and would force me to memorize
the whole Bible, every passage.

57:08.921 --> 57:12.592
One day
I forgot a paragraph...

57:14.126 --> 57:16.796
and he beat me so hard,

57:16.829 --> 57:18.898
I was in bed
the whole week after.

57:20.566 --> 57:24.070
Through all that,
I never hated that man.

57:25.805 --> 57:26.873
Why should I?

57:28.507 --> 57:32.879
He told me the demons
are always waiting.

57:32.912 --> 57:36.482
Abe, I don't follow you.

57:36.515 --> 57:39.852
And I lived with a demon
for all these years.

57:41.754 --> 57:43.923
I slept with it,

57:43.956 --> 57:46.592
I fed it

57:46.626 --> 57:48.928
and I loved it
with all my heart.

57:48.961 --> 57:50.696
- Abraham...
- Silence!

57:52.632 --> 57:53.966
Silence.

57:55.902 --> 57:58.971
I saw what you were doing
in our daughter's room.

57:59.005 --> 58:00.206
You've condemned her life!

58:00.239 --> 58:02.875
No, no, you misunderstood.

58:02.909 --> 58:05.912
I was only trying
to cure Sarah's...

58:05.945 --> 58:07.647
I tell you!

58:10.683 --> 58:12.685
Don't even
pronounce her name.

58:15.021 --> 58:16.188
Admit your sins.

58:18.724 --> 58:20.126
Admit your sins.

58:27.199 --> 58:30.937
Admit.
There's nothing worse...

58:30.970 --> 58:32.471
than a witch!

01:00:18.044 --> 01:00:21.247
"Beware, the ritual
will not work."

01:01:24.276 --> 01:01:26.378
Thomas.

01:01:32.452 --> 01:01:33.886
Sarah!

01:01:38.757 --> 01:01:39.859
Sarah!

01:01:39.892 --> 01:01:42.328
Rise, I
command, rise from your sleep

01:01:42.361 --> 01:01:44.363
and come forth
in multitudes.

01:01:46.799 --> 01:01:48.968
With these signs,
I summon you here.

01:01:49.001 --> 01:01:51.871
With these words,
I declare the gates open.

01:01:55.407 --> 01:01:59.979
Why have you done this to me?
After all that I've done for you?

01:02:02.748 --> 01:02:04.717
Silence, Father.

01:02:07.019 --> 01:02:09.955
You are a witch,
like your mother!

01:06:55.340 --> 01:07:00.045
"Beware, the ritual
will not work

01:07:00.078 --> 01:07:04.116
if the curse is conjured
by a blood relative."

01:08:41.648 --> 01:08:45.283
Recognize that,
Daddy? Hmm?

01:08:46.285 --> 01:08:47.819
It's my mama's
special book.

01:08:49.354 --> 01:08:52.424
It's the only memory
I have left of hers.

01:08:55.694 --> 01:08:57.062
Her teachings...

01:08:57.863 --> 01:09:00.098
your death's perfect recipe...

01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:03.803
It's all in there.

01:09:05.738 --> 01:09:08.206
All I needed

01:09:08.240 --> 01:09:12.377
was a little bit
of your blood...

01:09:14.179 --> 01:09:16.616
...to complete the curse.

01:09:24.791 --> 01:09:28.327
Do you really think
that faith of yours

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:30.697
can get you out of this?

01:09:34.366 --> 01:09:36.669
You're wrong.

01:09:36.703 --> 01:09:38.871
That little potion
you gave me last night

01:09:38.904 --> 01:09:42.274
gave you more of a chance
than that stupid cross!

01:09:43.876 --> 01:09:45.277
After all...

01:09:48.514 --> 01:09:53.886
it gave you one more day

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.789
of staying alive
while I slept.

01:09:58.691 --> 01:10:01.694
If we can call
what you do living.

01:10:18.310 --> 01:10:21.514
You've robbed me
of my mama's love,

01:10:21.547 --> 01:10:25.417
then you take away the only
friend I have in the world!

01:10:28.521 --> 01:10:29.856
It's my turn.

01:10:31.289 --> 01:10:33.258
It's my turn...

01:10:33.291 --> 01:10:35.928
to put an end
to your miserable life!

01:10:38.296 --> 01:10:40.533
Let's even up
the scales, shall we?

01:10:58.250 --> 01:11:00.520
I'm sorry.

01:11:02.555 --> 01:11:06.826
Sorry. I'm sorry.

01:11:06.859 --> 01:11:08.861
I'm sorry.

01:11:29.649 --> 01:11:34.352
Well, someone has finally woken up.

01:11:34.386 --> 01:11:36.723
I've been traveling alone
for an hour now.

01:11:42.795 --> 01:11:45.397
Is everything okay?

01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:48.000
Yeah.

01:11:48.034 --> 01:11:52.605
I just had a bad dream.

01:11:52.638 --> 01:11:54.339
Mm.

01:11:54.372 --> 01:11:58.578
Do you want
to talk about it?

01:11:58.611 --> 01:12:01.781
I can't remember much.

01:12:01.814 --> 01:12:05.585
It was me and you
and our daughter...

01:12:07.887 --> 01:12:11.057
and some strange creatures
attacking our home.

01:12:11.090 --> 01:12:13.760
Hmm.

01:12:13.793 --> 01:12:18.898
You should really cut out whatever
you've been reading lately.

01:12:24.504 --> 01:12:28.708
Hey, are you
all right?

01:12:28.741 --> 01:12:31.711
Yeah, it's just the baby.

01:12:31.744 --> 01:12:34.747
Lately she's been kicking,
even more than normal

01:12:37.450 --> 01:12:41.621
- Well, it's almost time, you know?
- Yeah.

01:12:43.456 --> 01:12:48.094
We should begin
thinking of a name.

01:12:48.127 --> 01:12:50.897
Yeah.

01:12:50.930 --> 01:12:52.297
So...

01:12:54.399 --> 01:12:56.769
What do you
think of Sarah?

01:12:58.437 --> 01:12:59.672
Sarah?

01:13:01.373 --> 01:13:02.475
Not bad.

01:13:04.911 --> 01:13:06.913
So, is it here?

01:13:11.017 --> 01:13:12.919
You'll see.

01:13:12.952 --> 01:13:15.721
We'll be happy here.

01:14:38.598 --> 01:14:43.598
