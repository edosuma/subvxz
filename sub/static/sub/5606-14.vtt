Nope.

Well, then!

09:37.177 --> 09:39.911

Valentine's Day story.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.546
Come on, now, McGarrett,
come on.

09:41.547 --> 09:43.180
Time for you to share.
Why is everyone so obsessed?

09:43.183 --> 09:45.250
I don't see how
a humiliating story

09:45.252 --> 09:47.586
about me is gonna make
anyone feel any better.

09:47.588 --> 09:49.321
You know,
it just might.

09:49.323 --> 09:52.057
Okay, fine, I'm happy to oblige

09:52.059 --> 09:53.959
right after Chin steps up,
how 'bout that?

09:53.961 --> 09:55.260
Okay, fair enough.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.195
Guys, there is
absolutely nothing to tell.

09:58.765 --> 10:00.198

10:00.200 --> 10:02.233
Hey, Abby,
it's me again.

10:02.235 --> 10:05.036
Listen, I-I just
wanted to say that

10:05.038 --> 10:06.204

you're going through,

10:06.206 --> 10:07.772

a call me back.

10:10.277 --> 10:11.843

10:11.845 --> 10:13.745

10:13.747 --> 10:15.313
Yeah.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.148

10:17.150 --> 10:18.917

10:18.919 --> 10:20.085

10:20.087 --> 10:21.186

10:21.188 --> 10:22.153
and you've got Adam
in prison.

10:22.155 --> 10:24.172
Oh, no, it's all right.

10:24.173 --> 10:26.190
At least I didn't humiliate
myself at the Kahala last night.

10:26.193 --> 10:27.726
You don't have to
remind me, okay?

10:27.728 --> 10:29.060
(chuckles)
Speaking of which--

10:29.062 --> 10:30.712
will you do me a favor?

10:30.713 --> 10:32.363
Don't let the guys know
about my nightmare, okay?

10:32.366 --> 10:34.199
Because if they do, I'm
just gonna be a punch line

10:34.201 --> 10:35.734

10:35.736 --> 10:36.801
Got it.
Thank you.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.172

Chin, it was, uh...

10:42.342 --> 10:43.908
very good to see you
last night.

10:46.880 --> 10:49.781
So what's the latest?

10:49.783 --> 10:51.249
Mrs. Cruz is in a coma.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.917
Doctors are doing
everything they can.

10:52.919 --> 10:55.420
It's not
looking good.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.159
All right, well,
once she's stable,

11:01.161 --> 11:03.128
let's get CSU in here
and collect some evidence.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.031
Of course, but there's something
else you should know.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.201
KONO:<i> All right,</i>
<i> so according to Duke,</i>

11:10.203 --> 11:12.137
Launa Cruz contacted
HPD yesterday

11:12.139 --> 11:14.806
to report
her husband missing.

11:14.808 --> 11:16.207
The thing was it was
less than 48 hours,

11:16.209 --> 11:18.209
so no official
investigation was opened.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.210
Well, that changes things.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.211
CHIN:
There's more.

11:20.213 --> 11:22.881
Mrs. Cruz... had
a clear abrasion

11:22.883 --> 11:24.849
between her thumb
and forefinger.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.317
It's the kind of injury
typically associated

11:26.319 --> 11:28.853
with the slide
of an automatic weapon

11:28.855 --> 11:30.255
as it catches the skin
when it goes back.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.790
Wait a minute,
she fired the gun?

11:31.792 --> 11:33.291
Well, here's the thing:

11:33.293 --> 11:35.727
Her prints aren't anywhere
on the champagne glasses.

11:35.729 --> 11:38.196
Okay, well, maybe we got
this whole thing wrong.

11:38.198 --> 11:41.199
Maybe Jack Cruz was
the one having the affair.

11:41.201 --> 11:44.302
He was using
that house to do so.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.371
Launa shows up to confront him,
they wrestle over the gun.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.974
All right, so our victim
started out as our perp.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.976
Well, the good news is we
were able to figure out

11:51.978 --> 11:53.978
whose prints were on
the champagne glasses.

11:53.980 --> 11:56.815
Now, lab matched them
back to a Natalie Jacobs.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.316
She's in the system
for solicitation.

11:58.318 --> 11:59.317
She's also
in the books

11:59.319 --> 12:01.186
at a high-priced
escort agency.

12:01.188 --> 12:02.187
Two grand a date.

12:02.189 --> 12:04.289
STEVE:
Wow.

12:04.291 --> 12:05.957
Yeah, if my husband was having
Valentine's Day with a hooker,

12:05.959 --> 12:07.892
I'd show up
with a gun too.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.894
And I thought I messed up.

12:09.896 --> 12:13.231
This guy's got to be a lock
for husband of the year.

12:13.233 --> 12:16.067
STEVE: This is the man you
spent Valentine's Day with.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.436
No.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.340
Okay, Natalie,
we found your prints

12:22.342 --> 12:24.008
at a crime scene
on Ocean Drive.

12:24.010 --> 12:26.344
I'm not denying that
I was at that house.

12:26.346 --> 12:29.347
I'm saying that's not
the guy that I was with.

12:29.349 --> 12:32.350
Okay, who-who's the guy
that you were with?

12:32.352 --> 12:34.352
He said his name
was Robert.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.488
But my guess is that's a lie.

12:36.490 --> 12:38.356
And he wasn't at all
like your guy.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.492
Robert looked older,

12:40.494 --> 12:42.327
had silverish hair
and brown eyes.

12:42.329 --> 12:46.331
Okay, have you done business
with Robert before?

12:46.333 --> 12:48.767
He was a first-time client.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.368
Best kind, too.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.369
Paid for the
girlfriend experience

12:51.371 --> 12:53.271
but was done in
under an hour.

12:53.273 --> 12:57.308
Okay, uh, do you know anything
else about the guy or...?

12:57.310 --> 13:00.178
He was sweet.

13:00.180 --> 13:02.914
Made an effort
to make it romantic.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.983
Even bought me a Valentine gift.

13:08.255 --> 13:11.256

at me like that for?

13:27.825 --> 13:29.158
"You know your
lingerie."

13:29.160 --> 13:30.292

my lingerie.

13:30.294 --> 13:31.577

17:48.619 --> 17:50.619
Yeah, or maybe she's got
someone back in San Francisco.

17:50.621 --> 17:51.987
You know,
I never asked her.

17:51.989 --> 17:53.556
She's got a life there,

17:53.557 --> 17:55.124
and one she's supposed
to be heading back to soon.

17:55.126 --> 17:58.193
Yeah, well, uh, you know,
she could be on social media.

17:58.195 --> 18:00.062
I'm saying you do
a little recon.

18:00.064 --> 18:01.931
That would be stalking.

18:01.933 --> 18:03.399
And she's not. I checked.

18:03.401 --> 18:04.466
(wry groan)

18:08.072 --> 18:11.106
Oh, greetings, Lieutenant
Kelly, Officer Kalakaua.

18:11.108 --> 18:13.409
Ah, finally, someone's
in a good mood.

18:13.411 --> 18:14.944
Indeed I am.

18:14.946 --> 18:16.946
It is entirely
due to the lovely evening

18:16.948 --> 18:20.449
I spent in the company
of my inamorata Sabrina.

18:20.451 --> 18:22.451
Sounds like things
are still going strong.

18:22.453 --> 18:24.453
Actually, it was
an anniversary of sorts.

18:24.455 --> 18:26.121
So we decided to return
to the place

18:26.123 --> 18:28.991
where our love first blossomed,

18:28.993 --> 18:31.727
commissary at
King's Medical Center.

18:31.729 --> 18:34.730
We even ordered the exact
same turkey Swiss sandwich

18:34.732 --> 18:36.298
and reminisced.

18:36.300 --> 18:38.634
Well, it's good to see
that romance isn't dead.

18:38.636 --> 18:40.569
MAX: No, only
our victim.

18:40.571 --> 18:43.238
C.O.D. was a GSW
administered at close range

18:43.240 --> 18:45.107
to the anterior skull.

18:45.109 --> 18:47.443
Ballistics do not match
the Launa Cruz case.

18:47.445 --> 18:48.978
What about
time of death?

18:48.980 --> 18:50.112
Uh, according to
liver temperature,

18:50.114 --> 18:51.613
Mr. Cruz was murdered

18:51.615 --> 18:54.583
sometime between 10:00 a.m.
and noon on February 13.

18:54.585 --> 18:56.585
February 13.

18:56.587 --> 18:58.187
That means Jack Cruz was dead

18:58.189 --> 18:59.655
at least 24 hours
before his wife went

18:59.657 --> 19:02.391
to that house on Ocean Drive.

19:02.393 --> 19:04.460
So why did she go there?

19:07.231 --> 19:08.964
So two days ago,
Jack Cruz responded

19:08.965 --> 19:10.698
to an e-mail from
a potential new client

19:10.701 --> 19:12.368
asking to view a spec house
he was building

19:12.370 --> 19:13.769
on the North Shore.

19:13.771 --> 19:15.771
We think he was being
lured there by his killer.

19:15.773 --> 19:18.640
We tried to trace the e-mail,
but it was a bogus account.

19:18.642 --> 19:20.509
Okay, where was
Launa Cruz at the time?

19:20.511 --> 19:22.511
Oh, she was at her
usual therapy session

19:22.513 --> 19:25.247
on the other side of the island
when her husband was shot.

19:25.249 --> 19:26.415
Okay, hold on.

19:26.417 --> 19:28.083
First we thought
that Launa Cruz's husband

19:28.085 --> 19:29.418
was trying to kill her.

19:29.420 --> 19:30.652
Then we thought she was
trying to kill him.

19:30.654 --> 19:32.454
Then we realized just now

19:32.456 --> 19:35.357
that he's dead, so who was
Launa Cruz trying to kill?

19:35.359 --> 19:38.193
We think she might have been
trying to kill this guy.

19:38.195 --> 19:40.696
KONO: This is the
artist composite

19:40.698 --> 19:42.698
of the man that Natalie claimed
that she hooked up with

19:42.700 --> 19:44.400
at the house
on Ocean Drive.

19:44.402 --> 19:45.701
We ran his face
through the databases

19:45.703 --> 19:47.236
but got no hit.

19:47.238 --> 19:48.570
All right, we need
to find out who this guy is

19:48.572 --> 19:51.540
and what his connection
to Launa Cruz is too.

19:51.542 --> 19:52.674
I hope she comes
out of that coma,

19:52.676 --> 19:54.376
otherwise we got nothing.

19:54.378 --> 19:55.511
DANNY:
The bra.

19:55.513 --> 19:57.613
What about the bra?

19:59.550 --> 20:02.051
The, uh, the bra that this guy
bought for, uh, Natalie.

20:02.053 --> 20:03.585
Oh, the Victoria's Secret?

20:03.587 --> 20:04.820
Yeah.

20:04.822 --> 20:06.088
Oh.

I thought you said you liked
women in nice lingerie.

20:53.437 --> 20:55.737
I do like women in nice lingerie.
Okay, carry on.

20:55.739 --> 20:57.039
Detective Williams bought

20:57.040 --> 20:58.340
a beautiful corset
a few weeks back.

20:58.342 --> 20:59.875
Did he? A corset? Yeah, it was...
it was, uh...

20:59.877 --> 21:01.510
That is specific.
Uh, it's a...

21:01.512 --> 21:02.744
Easy there.
We don't let him

21:02.746 --> 21:03.879
out of the house too much.
Listen.

21:03.881 --> 21:06.248
I got to ask you
a question. Um...

21:06.250 --> 21:08.150
Do you, uh, by any chance
recognize this guy?

21:08.152 --> 21:09.518
That's Michael Foxton.

21:09.520 --> 21:10.819
He comes here a lot.

21:10.821 --> 21:12.554
Knows what he likes.

21:12.556 --> 21:15.491
He's bought the same lingerie
seven times in the past month.

21:15.493 --> 21:17.526
I don't suppose he used

21:17.528 --> 21:19.428
a credit card
for any of those purchases?

21:19.430 --> 21:21.330
Only one time from memory.

21:21.332 --> 21:23.332
I-I imagine that was
for his wife.

21:23.334 --> 21:26.235
Can we get a copy of that,
of that transaction, please?

21:26.237 --> 21:27.302
Yes, you may.

21:27.304 --> 21:29.238
STEVE:
Thank you.

21:29.240 --> 21:31.773
I Love Victoria's.

21:33.878 --> 21:35.177
How you doing?
Mrs. Foxton?

21:35.179 --> 21:36.178
Yes?

21:36.180 --> 21:37.246
Hi, we're Five-O.

21:37.248 --> 21:38.413

21:38.415 --> 21:41.183
Uh, no, Michael.

21:41.185 --> 21:42.518
He-he's away on business.

That's, uh,
that's not him

hedge over there?

DANNY:
It's him, right?

21:48.692 --> 21:49.925
Have a seat.

21:49.927 --> 21:51.827
Okay, why don't you
tell us, uh,

21:51.829 --> 21:53.695
why don't you tell us about
this woman that you killed?

21:53.697 --> 21:55.264
Uh, her name was Launa Cruz,
by the way.

21:55.266 --> 21:56.532
Did you know that?

21:56.534 --> 21:58.267
No, I didn't know
that was her name.

21:58.269 --> 21:59.535
And before yesterday,
I'd never seen

21:59.537 --> 22:00.769
that woman before in my life.

22:00.771 --> 22:03.205
Okay, what about her husband?

22:03.207 --> 22:04.940
Yeah, what about her husband?
You kill him, too?

22:04.942 --> 22:06.642
She came for revenge or what?

22:06.644 --> 22:08.310
What? No!
Look.

22:08.312 --> 22:09.611
I'm not a good guy.
I cheat on my wife.

22:09.613 --> 22:10.879
But I don't know these people.

22:10.881 --> 22:12.514
That's the truth, I swear.

22:12.516 --> 22:15.384
All right, why don't you tell us
what happened at that house?

22:15.386 --> 22:17.519
I partied
with this girl Natalie.

22:17.521 --> 22:19.521
She left.

22:19.523 --> 22:21.106
I heard a sound.

22:21.107 --> 22:22.690
I thought it was her
coming back for something.

22:22.693 --> 22:24.259
It was that woman.

22:24.261 --> 22:25.561
She had a gun.

22:25.563 --> 22:26.628
We struggled.

22:26.630 --> 22:27.696
It went off.

22:27.698 --> 22:29.231
It was self-defense.

22:29.233 --> 22:31.266
I panicked, but I swear

22:31.268 --> 22:34.269
I was gonna turn myself in
right when you guys showed up.

22:34.271 --> 22:36.572
You know what's crazy
is the amount of people

22:36.574 --> 22:38.607
that tell me that
right after we arrest them.

22:38.609 --> 22:40.075
Look, it's true.

22:40.076 --> 22:41.542
Can I get a glass

"Happy Valentine's Day,

No, not love!
I mean, I did, uh,

25:19.703 --> 25:22.804
at the end I did XOXOXO,
bunch of XO's.

25:22.806 --> 25:23.905

25:59.643 --> 26:00.909
and it doesn't mean anything!

26:00.911 --> 26:02.043
I say it,
it means something!

26:02.045 --> 26:04.446
Oh, right, okay.

26:04.448 --> 26:06.481
Well, you've
never said it to me.

26:06.483 --> 26:08.116
That is not true.
Is that--?

26:08.118 --> 26:09.651
That's actually true?
Is that true?

26:09.653 --> 26:11.453
Is this about Rachel?

26:11.455 --> 26:14.423
No! This is about how much time
you make for me!

26:14.425 --> 26:16.591
About whether or not
I'm a priority!

26:16.593 --> 26:19.060
You are a priority.
You are a priority.

26:19.062 --> 26:21.430
You are a priority, okay?

26:21.432 --> 26:22.464
You are!

26:22.466 --> 26:23.598
You're not listening!

26:23.600 --> 26:26.001
I am!
You are a priority.

26:26.003 --> 26:27.769
You are...

26:27.771 --> 26:30.572
(crickets chirping)

26:30.574 --> 26:31.973
Okay, so what-- it's over?

26:31.975 --> 26:34.076
I don't know what it is.
I don't know.

26:34.077 --> 26:36.178
I got called to the crime scene
yesterday, and then she was

26:36.180 --> 26:37.946
still in bed when I left
and that's that.

26:37.948 --> 26:40.081
All right, so what are you
gonna do about it?

26:40.083 --> 26:41.716
I don't know.

26:41.718 --> 26:43.452
You better hope
we never solve this case,

26:43.454 --> 26:45.620
so you don't have
to go home again.

26:49.126 --> 26:50.759
KAMEKONA:
Mmm...

26:53.497 --> 26:55.564
Mmm.

26:56.900 --> 26:58.967
Mmm!

27:00.003 --> 27:02.471
What?

27:02.473 --> 27:03.805
Look, I appreciate the support,
but don't you

27:03.807 --> 27:05.040
have something
shrimp-related to do?

27:05.042 --> 27:07.242
Hostility's out of character.

27:07.244 --> 27:08.944
Maybe your blood sugar is low.

27:08.946 --> 27:11.213
Look, if I'm cranky,

27:11.215 --> 27:12.848
it's 'cause the clock
is ticking.

27:12.850 --> 27:14.716
I need to find a connection
between these two men.

27:14.718 --> 27:16.184
The team's counting on me.

27:16.186 --> 27:18.987
You want to know how
real pressure looks like?

27:18.989 --> 27:21.857
It's like playing Russian
Roulette with chocolate.

27:21.859 --> 27:24.092
You throw away the guide.

27:24.094 --> 27:25.927
Then you pick a candy.

27:25.929 --> 27:27.729
If you get the fruit center,

27:27.731 --> 27:29.498
game over, brah.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.566
You got the stones to play?

27:31.568 --> 27:33.168
Thanks.

27:33.170 --> 27:34.769
But no.

27:34.771 --> 27:36.505
This is my Valentine ritual.

27:36.507 --> 27:39.841
Every year I get the same
box of chocolates

27:39.843 --> 27:41.676
from a secret admirer.

27:41.678 --> 27:44.546
What secret admirer?

27:44.548 --> 27:45.580
Don't know.

27:45.582 --> 27:47.349
That's why they secret.

27:47.350 --> 27:49.117
You know, I could probably
find out who they are.

27:49.119 --> 27:52.587
You know, using my detective
superpowers and this computer.

27:52.589 --> 27:54.623
Well, mainly this computer.

27:54.625 --> 27:56.825
Thanks, but nah.

27:56.827 --> 28:00.662
The key to romance is mystery.

28:00.664 --> 28:02.598
(computer chimes)

28:02.599 --> 28:04.533
The secret to our mystery
is right here!

28:06.904 --> 28:08.970
Oh, what is that?

28:08.972 --> 28:10.639
You just got the bullet,
my friend.

28:10.641 --> 28:11.907
(laughs)

28:13.176 --> 28:14.576
Oh!

28:14.578 --> 28:17.312
(spits)

28:17.314 --> 28:19.548
Oh, Commander!

28:19.550 --> 28:21.883
You wanted to find a connection
between Cruz and Foxton?

28:21.885 --> 28:23.184
Well, here it is.

28:23.186 --> 28:25.120
Both men are members
of the Makai Country Club.

28:25.122 --> 28:26.888
So they're golfing buddies.

28:26.890 --> 28:28.957
Except I spoke to the manager
of the pro shop,

28:28.959 --> 28:31.693
and Cruz and Foxton
never share tee times.

28:31.695 --> 28:34.329
But here's the thing:

28:34.331 --> 28:36.631
The wives had lunch
with each other at the club

28:36.633 --> 28:38.700
five times
in the past month alone.

28:38.702 --> 28:41.236
All right, so there's attempts
on both the husband's lives

28:41.238 --> 28:42.704
within a 24-hour period,

28:42.706 --> 28:45.674
and both the wives have
rock-solid alibis.

28:45.676 --> 28:47.776
Two strangers
in unhappy marriages agree

28:47.778 --> 28:50.579
to kill each other's spouses
with no apparent motive.

28:50.581 --> 28:52.647
It's<i> Strangers on a Train.</i>

28:54.718 --> 28:56.952
Hitchcock.

28:56.954 --> 28:58.787
Gentlemen,
Michael Foxton is stable,

28:58.789 --> 29:00.221
so you can talk to him now.

29:00.223 --> 29:02.123
But there's something
you should know.

29:02.125 --> 29:04.793
It wasn't stress
that caused his heart attack.

29:06.363 --> 29:08.597
I told the doc
I took my heart pills.

29:08.599 --> 29:10.599
Well, you sure about that?

29:10.601 --> 29:11.700
Because he just said

29:11.702 --> 29:12.968
the medication
wasn't in your system.

29:12.970 --> 29:14.603
That's why you went
into cardiac arrest.

29:14.605 --> 29:15.770
It's impossible,
'cause Tessa gave them to me

29:18.609 --> 29:19.741
last night at home.

29:19.742 --> 29:20.874
Your-your wife, who you
are presently cheating on,

29:20.877 --> 29:22.677
she controls the medication
that determines

29:22.679 --> 29:24.346
whether you live or die?

29:24.348 --> 29:27.115
Yeah.

29:27.117 --> 29:29.217
Okay, whatever
your wife gave you

29:29.219 --> 29:30.885
wasn't your heart pills,
all right?

29:33.090 --> 29:35.857
Okay, so, we, uh, got
a couple angry wives

29:35.859 --> 29:37.225
having a bunch
of lunches and, uh,

29:37.227 --> 29:38.693
a doctor's word
against Tessa's

29:38.695 --> 29:40.195
that this guy
took the right medication.

29:40.197 --> 29:41.796
She could've
given him aspirin, right?

29:41.798 --> 29:43.064
And what's she gonna do?
She's got plenty of money.

29:43.066 --> 29:44.165
She's gonna lawyer up.

29:44.167 --> 29:45.300
And she'll walk.

29:55.379 --> 29:56.945
Is everything all right?

29:56.947 --> 29:58.747
Mrs. Foxton,
your husband, uh,

29:58.749 --> 30:00.315
he had a heart
attack in custody.

30:00.317 --> 30:03.051
(gasps) What?! He-he's all
right, though; he's stable.

30:03.053 --> 30:05.120
And the doctors think that
he's-he's gonna be just fine.

30:05.122 --> 30:07.756
Oh, oh, thank God!

30:07.758 --> 30:09.691
There is some
good news.

30:09.693 --> 30:12.227
Launa-- Launa Cruz has
come out of her coma.

30:12.229 --> 30:15.263
Yeah, it's just a matter
of waiting for her to, uh,

30:15.265 --> 30:17.165
regain enough consciousness
so we can question her.

30:17.167 --> 30:19.334
Just, you know,
to make sure that her story

30:19.336 --> 30:21.136
matches up with
your husband... we're good.

30:25.409 --> 30:27.676
(door opens)

30:34.217 --> 30:35.917

Helpful words.

35:10.727 --> 35:13.061
JERRY:
What?

35:13.063 --> 35:14.395
What?

35:15.632 --> 35:18.599
Look, we met online
and neither of us wanted to do

35:18.601 --> 35:21.336
the cheesy Valentine's Day
thing, so, you know,

35:21.338 --> 35:22.503

I'm not.

35:25.208 --> 35:27.475
But, uh,
that's not it.

35:27.476 --> 35:29.743
Right now, the campfire session
belongs to McGarrett.

35:29.746 --> 35:31.446
Oh, he's gonna explain
the black eye?

35:31.448 --> 35:32.613
Yes, sir.

35:32.615 --> 35:33.715
Cool.

35:36.286 --> 35:39.554
So, uh, it all started
on Valentine's Day morning.

35:44.427 --> 35:46.394
You mind if I borrow a shirt?

35:46.396 --> 35:48.730
What do you want a shirt for?
(laughs)

35:48.732 --> 35:50.264
Yes, you can borrow a shirt.

35:50.266 --> 35:52.133
Second drawer down.

35:56.172 --> 35:59.240
DANNY: <i> She found your Phil
Collins</i> <i> T-shirt and that was it.</i>

35:59.242 --> 36:00.341
<i> She was done.</i>

36:00.343 --> 36:02.176
STEVE:
<i>Very funny. She found the ring.</i>

36:02.178 --> 36:03.511
GROVER:
<i> What?</i>

36:03.513 --> 36:05.013
<i> Wait,</i> the<i> ring?</i>

36:05.014 --> 36:06.514
STEVE: <i> Yeah,</i> the<i> ring.
</i> <i> She found the ring</i>

36:06.516 --> 36:08.549
<i> that I bought for Catherine,</i>
<i> the engagement ring.</i>

36:08.551 --> 36:10.385
That is an "oof."

36:10.387 --> 36:12.520
Yes, it was, it was
definitely an "oof."

36:12.522 --> 36:14.455
Okay, so what was it
doing in your dresser?

36:14.457 --> 36:16.391
You know, the funny thing

36:16.393 --> 36:18.259
is that was the question
Lynn asked me.

36:18.261 --> 36:20.345
What is this?

36:20.346 --> 36:22.430
STEVE: <i> She felt that I'd been</i>
<i> hiding something from her.</i>

36:22.432 --> 36:24.565
CHIN:
<i> Uh, well, you were. The ring.</i>

36:24.567 --> 36:26.634
STEVE:<i> Yeah, and with the</i>
<i> seriousness of-of</i>

36:26.636 --> 36:28.169
<i>my relationship with Catherine,</i>

36:28.171 --> 36:29.570
<i> the fact that</i>
<i> I was gonna ask her to, uh,</i>

36:29.572 --> 36:31.105
<i> to marry me.</i>

36:31.107 --> 36:33.174
She doesn't want to be
part of a rebound thing,

36:33.176 --> 36:34.642
which is understandable,

36:34.644 --> 36:37.512
and, uh, she thinks my head's
not in the game.

36:37.514 --> 36:39.280
Okay, so how did it end?

36:39.282 --> 36:40.782
STEVE:
<i> Um, not well.</i>

36:40.784 --> 36:41.783
<i> She left.</i>

36:41.785 --> 36:43.051
<i> She was very upset.</i>

36:43.053 --> 36:45.153
That's terrible.
Sad story.

36:45.155 --> 36:48.289
Listen, uh, I came here
to hear about the black eye.

36:48.291 --> 36:49.557
I got it.

36:49.559 --> 36:51.125
<i> She hit you with the ring.</i>

36:52.462 --> 36:53.995
Nope.
No?

36:53.996 --> 36:55.529
GROVER: Okay, all right.
How about this?

36:55.532 --> 36:57.665
You were rooting around in the
closet looking for something...

36:57.667 --> 37:01.369
<i> baseball falls off a shelf,</i>

37:01.371 --> 37:02.703
hits you right
in the eye.

37:02.705 --> 37:04.172
No.

37:04.174 --> 37:05.506
Got hit in the head
with a coconut.

37:05.508 --> 37:07.408
You dropped a practice grenade
on your face.

37:07.410 --> 37:08.376
You walked into a tree.

37:08.378 --> 37:09.544
You fell into a doorknob.

37:09.546 --> 37:10.678
Got kicked by a horse.

37:12.615 --> 37:14.315
Yeah, I don't know
why I said that.

37:14.317 --> 37:15.483
Now, can I just...?

37:15.485 --> 37:16.651
Just settle down, okay?

37:18.455 --> 37:20.688
We went to Morimoto's,
the private room.

37:20.690 --> 37:22.457
The private room?

37:22.459 --> 37:23.624
Yeah, I called the chef.

37:23.626 --> 37:25.159
The restaurant
was at capacity,

37:25.161 --> 37:26.527
so he put me in
the private room.

37:26.529 --> 37:28.796
So I pulled out
all the stops,

37:28.798 --> 37:30.465
