We're not gonna be
able to hide away
in a cabana.

00:09.493 --> 00:11.744
Then maybe it's time
we tell the family.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.328
I'm billie denton,
prosper's daughter.

00:13.414 --> 00:15.214
[violet]<i> she says</i>

00:15.332 --> 00:17.416

00:22.156 --> 00:23.989
You are having a little girl.

00:24.091 --> 00:25.324
Yeah.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.760

love your baby girl

[cheers and applause]

00:36.237 --> 00:39.271
I can do it, it's just
making too much fuss.

00:39.356 --> 00:41.857
[billie] a few more weeks
of physical therapy
and you'll be good as new.

00:41.942 --> 00:43.525
[hollywood] no,
better than new.

00:43.611 --> 00:45.994
Gonna have to put up
a fist to keep
the ladies away, right?

00:46.080 --> 00:48.997
You gave us quite a scare,
prosper.

00:49.083 --> 00:50.949
[hollywood] ah, that's just
the first round.

00:51.035 --> 00:53.118
He'll come back like ali, huh?

00:53.220 --> 00:54.753
[charley] you look good.

00:54.855 --> 00:56.021
Mmm.

00:56.123 --> 00:57.589
[violet] welcome, baby.

00:58.209 --> 00:59.792
Can I get you anything?

00:59.877 --> 01:01.260
[prosper] no, I'm fine.

01:02.596 --> 01:05.130
Unless you got
some of that pecan pie
with you.

01:05.216 --> 01:07.516
[laughs]

01:07.601 --> 01:11.186
I told hollywood that
you were gonna want some.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.522
I got you.

01:13.607 --> 01:16.775
Yeah, you know,
I wish I could see
your face behind that mask.

01:16.894 --> 01:19.561
I can feel the love, though.
Yeah, thank you.

01:20.114 --> 01:21.480
[chuckles]

01:31.759 --> 01:33.158
[nova] hey.

01:35.079 --> 01:36.378
[prosper] how are you?

01:36.464 --> 01:38.997
This can't be easy
for either of you,

01:39.083 --> 01:41.333
stepping into these new roles.

01:41.418 --> 01:43.552
He's so open with your family.

01:43.637 --> 01:45.704
[charley] just give it
some time.

01:45.806 --> 01:48.640
When you're in chicago,
all he talks about is you.

01:48.759 --> 01:52.678
And when I'm here,
all he talks about
is the bordelons.

01:52.763 --> 01:55.597
[charley] then there's love
on both sides
of the equation.

01:58.602 --> 02:01.753
Just think about this
as a do-over,

02:01.856 --> 02:05.491
you know, a chance to make it
what you want it to be.

02:08.129 --> 02:09.912
[billie sighs]

02:09.997 --> 02:12.114
[nova] I'm so glad to see you
out of that hospital.

02:12.199 --> 02:13.282
[prosper] yeah. Me, too.

02:13.367 --> 02:15.701
Yeah, counting my blessings.

02:15.786 --> 02:19.121
Keep thinking
about all those people
that couldn't come home.

02:19.790 --> 02:22.490
Amen.
Too much pain this year.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.794
But you waking up
was a ray of light.

02:27.298 --> 02:30.048
Keep shining on us, okay?

No, sir. Your supplies are
already boxed up in the back.

03:22.436 --> 03:24.069
What's this big, old box?
Who is it for?

03:24.171 --> 03:27.105
My customers.
Stop being so nosy.

03:27.191 --> 03:29.274

04:23.580 --> 04:25.497
-you know, right?
-It's a little deeper
than that, charley.

04:25.582 --> 04:27.799
We wouldn't be in this mess
without the usda.

04:28.736 --> 04:30.002

04:46.603 --> 04:47.919

I'm just a paralegal,

04:48.022 --> 04:50.222

redlining cases for years.

04:50.324 --> 04:52.891

05:29.897 --> 05:31.263
What are you doing here?

05:31.348 --> 05:33.815
Oh, we got a call
from a concerned citizen.

05:33.901 --> 05:34.900
[nova] about what?

05:35.019 --> 05:36.651
It's a meeting
for the farmers collective.

05:36.737 --> 05:38.487
The black farmers collective.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.439
[ralph] you're saying
black folk can't
have a meeting?

05:40.541 --> 05:42.324
What are you saying,
I can't attend
a public meeting

05:42.409 --> 05:44.042

05:46.030 --> 05:47.379

05:51.035 --> 05:52.484
Of course I can.

05:55.339 --> 05:56.588
[ralph] what is this, charley?

05:57.541 --> 05:58.924

This is hollywood, my husband.

06:41.518 --> 06:43.351
He wanted to meet you.

06:43.437 --> 06:45.136
Nice to meet you,
mr. Hollywood.

06:45.239 --> 06:48.156
-[hollywood] and who is this?
-Come on.

06:48.275 --> 06:53.144
This is my son gabriel,
named after the angel
from the bible.

06:53.247 --> 06:55.430
Are you famous, mr. Hollywood?

06:55.532 --> 06:58.533
I'm famous at tic-tac-toe.
You know what that is?

06:58.786 --> 06:59.984
No, sir.

07:00.087 --> 07:01.586
Oh, we gonna have to fix that.

07:08.962 --> 07:10.345
[chuckles]

07:10.447 --> 07:14.099
that is the first time
I've seen my baby smile
in weeks.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.019
I sure can't seem
to make him smile anymore.

07:18.138 --> 07:21.673
He will smile again
when you can smile again.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.126
You've got a lot
on your shoulders, baby.

07:24.228 --> 07:26.194
But you're surviving.

07:26.313 --> 07:29.481
Ma'am, I feel like
I've been barely surviving now
for over a year.

07:30.284 --> 07:33.068
It just won't let up.

07:33.170 --> 07:35.487
We was all trapped
in that house

07:35.572 --> 07:38.206
when greg lost his job
because of covid,

07:38.325 --> 07:42.744
no work for either of us,
no school for gabriel.

07:42.830 --> 07:47.532
I thought, "that man
has been taken
his frustrations out on me

07:47.634 --> 07:49.000
since we got married.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.803
I'm getting used to it."

07:52.840 --> 07:54.506
but then,

07:54.591 --> 07:57.676
them little pops in the mouth
turned into fists in my face.

07:59.096 --> 08:01.346
I felt my soul
slipping away.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.181
I thought I could take it.

08:03.267 --> 08:05.600
I've been taking it
all these years but...

08:07.821 --> 08:09.437
Ooh, ms. Vi,

08:09.523 --> 08:13.992
the man started taking
his frustrations out
on gabriel

08:14.828 --> 08:16.227
and I had to go.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.948
Nobody is hurting my baby.

08:21.518 --> 08:22.868
[violet] you're right.

08:22.953 --> 08:26.955
Nobody's hurting your baby
and nobody's hurting you,
not anymore.

08:28.375 --> 08:32.744
That's all because
you took a stand for yourself.

08:32.829 --> 08:34.796
You got out of there.

08:34.882 --> 08:40.719
You're smart.
You came to a parish
where he don't know folks.

08:41.522 --> 08:43.254
And, baby,

08:43.357 --> 08:46.224
you connected
with the right people, baby.

08:46.894 --> 08:50.562
You are here, you are safe.

08:51.481 --> 08:53.932
And you are going
to get through this

08:54.034 --> 08:57.285
and have
a beautiful testimony.

08:57.404 --> 08:58.987
Believe that.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.965

09:10.083 --> 09:12.784
[representative] look,
I understand your frustration

09:12.886 --> 09:14.669
and I'll get
to all of your questions.

09:15.756 --> 09:18.089
There's only one question
that matters.

09:18.175 --> 09:20.425
When y'all gonna make
receipts for our claims

09:20.510 --> 09:22.510
-and when y'all gonna
cut our checks?
-[man] that's right.

09:22.596 --> 09:25.146
-We have to take
every allegation seriously.
-[ralph] mm-hmm.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.982
And that's caused
some unexpected delays.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.817
[ralph] now we've been jacked
around long enough,

09:28.919 --> 09:30.101
-y'all need to pay us.
-[all] pay us.

09:30.187 --> 09:32.787
Pay us! Pay us! Pay us!

09:32.889 --> 09:36.524
First, you got
to be black to get a vaccine
and now this?

09:36.627 --> 09:38.159
Where's our special fund?

09:38.262 --> 09:40.278
[charley] okay,
this fund was set up

09:40.364 --> 09:42.697
to cover
generational discrimination.

09:42.783 --> 09:45.283
Seems like
it's about reparations to me.

09:45.369 --> 09:46.818
[nova] this isn't reparations.

09:46.920 --> 09:50.005
Reparations will be
paying back the $5.9 trillion

09:50.123 --> 09:52.123
owed to our ancestors
and their descendants.

09:52.209 --> 09:54.175
-See, she admits it,
right out of her mouth.
-[nova] oh, yeah, thief.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.878
You stole proceedings
from our vaccine drive!

09:56.964 --> 09:58.346
You're stealing right now.

09:58.465 --> 10:02.017
We're processing these claims
as fast as we can.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.552
But the more claims,
the slower the process.

10:04.638 --> 10:08.023
All claims have
to be fully investigated.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.809
It can take time,
longer than you might expect.

10:12.279 --> 10:15.680
[billie] sir,
<i> pigford v. Glickman</i> already
set the legal precedent.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.699
The patterns of discrimination
are clear.

10:17.818 --> 10:19.534
There's no point
in dragging this out.

10:19.653 --> 10:21.736
Pay these farmers
what they are owed

10:21.822 --> 10:24.406
or they'll be forced
to take their grievances
to court for emergency relief.

10:24.491 --> 10:25.790
[applause]

10:30.964 --> 10:32.213
[representative]
that's the update we have.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.581
We'll have another
in about six weeks.

10:33.684 --> 10:34.983
-[man] six weeks?
-[woman] six weeks?

10:35.085 --> 10:36.418
[ralph] what do you mean
six weeks, huh?

10:36.520 --> 10:38.920
What am I supposed to do
for six weeks? Hey!

10:39.022 --> 10:40.588
Six weeks!

10:40.674 --> 10:42.173
[indistinct conversations]

10:46.680 --> 10:48.013
why you ain't tell me, vi?

10:49.182 --> 10:52.067
Now what if...
What if her husband showed up?

10:52.185 --> 10:53.518
And I ain't even know
where you were.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.071
This is what I'm always
talking about, vi.

10:56.189 --> 10:58.356
And that's why
I didn't tell you.

10:59.660 --> 11:02.393
'cause I knew this is exactly
how you would act,

11:02.496 --> 11:06.898
telling me that I'm always
helping everybody else.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.367
I just didn't want
to fight anymore
about how I do me.

11:09.453 --> 11:12.087
That's what
you think about me,
just a broken record.

11:12.205 --> 11:15.623
Look, you and me,
we're the same.

11:15.709 --> 11:20.378
The real spot is just you
taking care of everybody else
instead of yourself.

11:22.849 --> 11:23.882
Wow.

11:31.975 --> 11:33.641
[sighs]

11:33.727 --> 11:35.226
[car door closes]

11:46.957 --> 11:48.656
[cell phone ringing]

11:54.831 --> 11:56.214
[can clinks]

11:56.299 --> 11:58.449
-yeah, what?
-[charley]<i> yeah, what?</i>

11:58.552 --> 12:01.970
[scoffs]<i> I know</i>
<i> I raised you better than</i>
<i>to answer the phone like that.</i>

12:02.089 --> 12:04.089
[micah]<i> sorry,</i>
<i> I didn't see it was you.</i>

12:04.174 --> 12:06.424
I just want to remind you
about dinner tonight

12:06.510 --> 12:09.460
with your dad
and the family at aunt vi's.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.013
That's a sentence
I never thought
I'd hear you say again.

12:16.603 --> 12:19.187
Well, um,
do you want to talk about it,

12:19.740 --> 12:20.939
talk it through?

12:23.610 --> 12:26.861
Your feelings about
all of this are important
to us, micah.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.147
I hope you know that.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.982
<i> No, no.</i>

12:31.084 --> 12:34.586
I just want you to be happy.

12:34.671 --> 12:35.754
<i> I want him to be happy.</i>

12:35.839 --> 12:38.006
So if you two think that
you can be happy together,

12:38.108 --> 12:40.208
then, by all means,
go for it.

12:42.112 --> 12:43.411
All right? Um,

12:44.714 --> 12:46.748
I don't want you
to hurt like that again.

12:48.051 --> 12:49.634
<i> I don't think</i>
<i> either of us could take it.</i>

12:51.104 --> 12:53.104
Thank you, baby, for...
For saying that.

12:54.391 --> 12:55.356
I hear you.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.358
I'll, um,
I'll see you later tonight?

12:57.461 --> 12:58.626
I'll see you tonight.

12:58.728 --> 12:59.861
Bye, sweetheart.

13:01.648 --> 13:04.149
Guess I thought
he'd be happier

13:04.234 --> 13:05.567
that we were back together.

13:08.104 --> 13:10.655
He used to talk about it
all the time.

13:10.740 --> 13:12.874
He won't be alone
in his reservations.

13:14.327 --> 13:16.027
[inhales sharply]

13:16.129 --> 13:19.831
you know, some of your family
might not be too happy
seeing us together.

13:21.334 --> 13:23.334
And no one in your family
is gonna hold back.

13:23.420 --> 13:27.388
Well, I know
some might be surprised,

13:27.507 --> 13:30.541
but I don't think anyone
is gonna be opposed.

13:30.644 --> 13:31.976
Well,

13:32.062 --> 13:35.480
I am ready to plead my case
with the court
of the bordelons.

13:35.565 --> 13:36.731
[chuckles]

13:36.850 --> 13:39.234
-I have my opening remarks
ready, my rebuttals.
-Wow.

13:39.352 --> 13:42.904
Yeah, and I just have
to withstand
the cross-examination

13:43.023 --> 13:45.156
so that I can get
to my closing argument.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.774
They are indeed a handful.

13:48.528 --> 13:51.412
May not be easy,
but you're up to it.

13:51.531 --> 13:52.997
Ain't no other way to be.

14:00.457 --> 14:01.873
[door closes]

14:03.510 --> 14:05.376
[kids chattering]

14:11.134 --> 14:13.601
[woman] I saw your talk
with tarana burke
on your live.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.220
It was powerful.

14:15.305 --> 14:18.056
Thank you.
Thanks very much.

14:18.141 --> 14:19.691
-Did you watch?
-Of course I did.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.776
Excellent, as always.

14:21.895 --> 14:24.262
You got me thinking about
our intersection
with whiteness.

14:24.364 --> 14:28.700
It's a lot to unpack.
A lot to process.

14:29.736 --> 14:32.270
What, am I being too dramatic?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.205
No, you should just check out
my uncle's new space

14:34.291 --> 14:35.957
the real spot
one of these days.

14:36.076 --> 14:37.709
It's a place
for men to process.

14:37.794 --> 14:39.460
I'm not sure
what goes on in there,

14:39.563 --> 14:42.046
but maybe you can
give us ladies a scoop on
what happens inside.

14:42.132 --> 14:43.965
[woman] yeah,
we want the scoop.

14:44.084 --> 14:45.133
Oh, no, ma'am.
No, ma'am.

14:45.252 --> 14:46.901
If the real spot
is a spot just for men,

14:47.003 --> 14:49.804
then what happens
at the real spot stays
at the real spot.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.806
Oh, you got slogans.

14:51.925 --> 14:54.058
I've been writing them down.

14:54.144 --> 14:55.476
Bye, y'all.

15:11.528 --> 15:12.777
[gate rattles]

15:13.780 --> 15:15.663
[party music playing]

15:19.869 --> 15:22.787
never thought I'd see the day
davis was back in this house.

15:22.872 --> 15:24.589
Me neither,

15:24.674 --> 15:30.328
-but life is about change
and davis has changed.
-I heard that.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.497
I've never met him
before the change.
What was he like?

15:33.600 --> 15:39.170
Well, some men
don't know what they have
until it's gone.

15:39.272 --> 15:40.805
We never have a chance
to make mistakes.

15:40.890 --> 15:45.526
Well, I for one,
am excited that the hook-up
has come back.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.312
[laughter]

15:47.397 --> 15:48.479
man.

15:48.565 --> 15:50.514
Ernest used to be so proud.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.818
"yeah,
my son-in-law davis west."

15:53.903 --> 15:55.820
him and prosper be
on the court
looking like kings,

15:55.905 --> 15:59.624
on that courtside,
ooh, those were the days.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.360
Well, he might not be
able to get you
front-row seats,

16:02.462 --> 16:03.795
since those go to the players,

16:03.880 --> 16:07.966
but if this coaching gig that
he's up for comes through,

16:08.051 --> 16:08.967
second row ain't bad.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.501
Hey, beggars
can't be choosers.

16:10.587 --> 16:12.303
-[laughter]
-[knocking on door]

16:21.982 --> 16:23.564
if it ain't the man himself.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.350
Mr. Davis west.

16:25.435 --> 16:26.884
Hey, what's up, big brother?

16:26.987 --> 16:28.386
-[davis] it's good
to see you, man.
-It's been a minute.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.388
-How are you?
-I grew up a little bit.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.357
Yeah, yeah.
We all...

16:32.442 --> 16:35.026
Look, congrats
on the wedding and the baby.

16:35.111 --> 16:36.411
I'm happy for you, bruh.

16:36.529 --> 16:37.412
-What's up, mama?
-Hey, baby.

16:37.530 --> 16:38.746
-You good?
-[charley] yeah.

16:38.865 --> 16:40.698
-I appreciate you.
Welcome back.
-[davis] thank you, bro.

16:40.784 --> 16:42.166
-[ralph] yes, indeed.
-There he is.

16:42.252 --> 16:44.335
-Hollywood.
-[hollywood] oh, big man.
Good to see you.

16:44.421 --> 16:45.870
[davis] oh, man.

16:45.955 --> 16:48.506
Come on, man.
Come on, pull up a chair.

16:48.591 --> 16:49.841
[davis sighs]

16:50.877 --> 16:51.759
hey, nova.

16:51.878 --> 16:54.545
-Nice to see you again, davis.
-You too.

16:54.631 --> 16:57.015
-Darla, hi.
-Hi. It's nice to see you.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.703
-Hey, baby.
-How are you?

17:01.805 --> 17:02.770
[violet] I'm good.

17:02.889 --> 17:03.738
[micah] good to see you.

17:03.840 --> 17:05.239
Davis.

17:05.358 --> 17:06.724
[davis] evening, aunt vi.

17:07.977 --> 17:09.610
These are for you, and, um...

17:11.064 --> 17:12.363
Thanks for having me over.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.783
Well, you're welcome.
Thanks.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.405
[davis] guys,
before we get started,

17:22.075 --> 17:26.160
if I could just say
that it's been on my heart
for a long time

17:28.415 --> 17:30.415
to apologize to all of you.

17:33.420 --> 17:34.886
Breaking your trust in me.

17:36.473 --> 17:38.890
I'd never really
had much of a family,

17:40.143 --> 17:42.793
but when I first came home
with charley,

17:42.896 --> 17:45.179
you guys took me in like
I was one of yours.

17:46.683 --> 17:47.899
So, uh,

17:50.687 --> 17:52.070
thank you
for the second chance.

17:55.442 --> 17:56.824
Especially you.

17:58.361 --> 17:59.577
I love you, charley.

18:01.197 --> 18:02.363
I love you, too, micah.

18:04.451 --> 18:07.034
-Let's eat, y'all.
-Yes, let's do it.

18:08.505 --> 18:11.339
Micah west, I don't know,
we haven't done this
in a while,

18:11.458 --> 18:14.492
but we say grace around
before we eat.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.761
-[micah] I'm sorry.
-All right,
now let's get into it.

18:16.846 --> 18:18.763
-Let's get into it.
-Come on, come on, come on.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.047
[hollywood] yes.

18:21.050 --> 18:23.935
Now, we all know this has
been a hard year,

18:25.355 --> 18:28.506
lost a lot of people, friends,

18:28.608 --> 18:29.857
co-workers,

18:30.977 --> 18:32.310
mothers,

18:32.395 --> 18:36.130
but this year has
also given us the opportunity

18:37.033 --> 18:39.700
to put stock
on what's important

18:39.819 --> 18:42.120
and to let go of
what we need to let go of

18:42.205 --> 18:45.373
and hold tight to things
that we want,

18:47.627 --> 18:49.627
and remember
what matters the most.

18:49.712 --> 18:51.462
-That's real.
-[hollywood] is each one of us

18:54.167 --> 18:56.334
to be the guiding force

18:56.419 --> 19:00.555
and not to let our ego
and our pain
and our past guide us,

19:00.673 --> 19:05.476
but be guided by something
that is more mighty, wiser,

19:05.562 --> 19:07.812
-and stronger forever, god.
-Yep.

19:07.897 --> 19:12.033
And, lord,
we ask you to bless
each and every one of us

19:12.135 --> 19:14.168
and bless this food
that we're about to receive.

19:14.270 --> 19:15.570
-Amen.
-[all] amen.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.555
Amen. Dr. Reverend hollywood.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.940
[laughter]

19:21.303 --> 19:23.436
[rap music playing]

19:25.907 --> 19:27.006
ah.

19:27.109 --> 19:28.074
Ha-ha.

19:28.176 --> 19:31.728
Baby, I am so glad for you.

19:31.813 --> 19:35.365
This is a dream you've been
holding a long time.

19:35.450 --> 19:36.816
Thank you,<i> cher.</i>

19:36.902 --> 19:39.903
Okay, so I got you set up
with food and spirits

19:39.988 --> 19:43.156
and I'm gonna get out of here
and go to my ladies night.

19:43.258 --> 19:45.825
-Baby, I am so happy.
-[laughs]

19:45.911 --> 19:48.328
-oh.
-[violet] that makes me happy.

19:48.413 --> 19:49.546
-Wood.
-Yo, yo.

19:49.631 --> 19:50.613
I want you to meet my people.

19:50.715 --> 19:52.665
-[violet] I'm done, I'm going.
-Bye, aunt vi.

19:52.751 --> 19:53.883
Bye!

19:54.970 --> 19:56.586
-This my homie theo.
-What's up, bruh?

19:56.671 --> 19:58.254
-Everybody call me theo, man.
-[hollywood] yeah.

19:58.340 --> 20:00.390
So, this the new spot,
huh?

20:00.475 --> 20:03.009
Yeah, it's gonna
be something, yeah.
How y'all boys meet?

20:03.095 --> 20:04.644
-[ralph] oh, man.
-Prison, man.

20:05.981 --> 20:07.463
Okay. Yeah, well,

20:07.566 --> 20:10.400
you know, any friend of ral
is welcome here.

20:10.485 --> 20:11.734
-All right?
-All right, brother.

20:11.820 --> 20:14.854
Hey, man, I want you
to meet homie dale. Cardale.

20:15.574 --> 20:16.973
It's my people from g.

20:17.075 --> 20:18.241
Oh, yeah?

20:18.326 --> 20:19.442
Nice to meet you, man.

20:19.528 --> 20:20.977
-And your name?
-Theo.

20:21.079 --> 20:22.145
-Theo.
-Yeah.

20:22.247 --> 20:23.780
-Hey, theo.
Welcome to st. Jo.
-Yo.

20:23.865 --> 20:26.199
-Yeah, welcome.
-Everybody, prosper wants
to say what's up.

20:26.284 --> 20:28.818
-Oh, no, that's prosper.
-Hey!

20:28.920 --> 20:30.286
Prosper!

20:30.372 --> 20:33.289
Old friends, good to see you
in that old rickety
chair of yours.

20:33.375 --> 20:36.793
<i> Right, watch it.</i>
<i> After all the damn painting</i>
<i> I did down there,</i>

20:36.878 --> 20:38.761
<i> I wouldn't miss this</i>
<i> for nothing in the world.</i>

20:38.847 --> 20:40.463
-Hey, get better soon.
-That's right.

20:40.549 --> 20:42.599
You missed
a couple spots
that I had to patch up.

20:44.052 --> 20:46.169
[billie]<i> come on, dad.</i>
<i> You need to eat.</i>

20:46.271 --> 20:48.555
<i> I made you some</i>
<i> steamed chicken.</i>

20:48.640 --> 20:50.056
<i> I'm coming, I'm coming.</i>

20:51.309 --> 20:52.675
All right.

20:52.777 --> 20:56.729
I invited all of you here
because you brothers
are important to me.

20:56.815 --> 20:59.682
You're important
to the community.

20:59.784 --> 21:02.018
And most of all,
you negros got
your vaccinations.

21:02.120 --> 21:04.070
[laughter]

21:04.156 --> 21:07.407
but seriously, this place,

21:07.492 --> 21:08.691
it's just for us.

21:08.793 --> 21:10.160
-That's right.
-[man] yeah.

21:10.245 --> 21:13.580
For us to convene,
vibe, and work out
whatever's going on with us.

21:13.665 --> 21:15.248
-Yeah.
-Just be.

21:16.718 --> 21:18.801
So, who wants to go first?

21:20.472 --> 21:22.338
Come on, maybe...

21:22.424 --> 21:25.374
Maybe we could talk about
whatever's on our minds,

21:25.477 --> 21:26.976
whatever we're thinking about.

21:27.062 --> 21:30.046
And you know your boy wood
has come prepared, huh?

21:30.148 --> 21:31.731
-[laughter]
-uh-huh.

21:32.934 --> 21:34.484
But,

21:34.569 --> 21:37.020
you gets no yak
if you don't start yakking.

21:37.572 --> 21:39.105
[all laughing]

21:39.741 --> 21:40.857
yeah.

21:40.942 --> 21:44.944
Well, he'll see how hard it is
to get men to open up.

21:46.198 --> 21:47.447
Pulling teeth.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.016
Everything okay
with you and wood?

21:50.118 --> 21:51.784
[violet] just a little
speed bump,

21:51.870 --> 21:55.205
-but we all got 'em
this year, right?
-Mmm.

21:55.290 --> 21:58.291
Feels good to finally have
everything out in the open.

22:05.517 --> 22:06.549
What?

22:07.302 --> 22:08.718
[chuckles]

22:08.803 --> 22:11.221
we're just happy
for you, girl.

22:11.306 --> 22:13.439
Do your political folks know
about you and davis?

22:15.110 --> 22:17.777
It's none of their business
how I feel about my man.

22:18.613 --> 22:19.979
[darla] how do you feel
about him?

22:21.983 --> 22:23.366
Are you in love
with him again?

22:27.122 --> 22:28.621
I'm close.

22:30.125 --> 22:31.874
Definitely in my feelings.

22:31.960 --> 22:35.111
Well, the fact is you all
are public figures

22:35.213 --> 22:37.497
and folks are gonna
have their opinions.

22:39.267 --> 22:40.883
[hollywood] so, micah,
maybe you want
to start it off?

22:40.969 --> 22:42.468
Why I got to go first?

22:43.805 --> 22:45.672
'cause you're generation emo.

22:45.757 --> 22:48.091
You all share everything
on the gram every day long,
huh?

22:48.176 --> 22:50.059
Man, I'll go first
if I get some of that yak.

22:50.145 --> 22:52.045
Oh, no, no,
you're gonna be real good

22:52.147 --> 22:53.730
-with that cold drink
right there.
-Mmm.

22:53.815 --> 22:55.181
[laughter]

22:56.434 --> 22:58.518
I feel like

22:58.603 --> 23:01.271
I'm getting
a second chance, you know?

23:02.407 --> 23:03.856
I just...

23:03.942 --> 23:06.309
I don't want
to mess anything up.

23:06.411 --> 23:09.245
You won't and nothing bad's
gonna happen.

23:10.582 --> 23:11.914
I don't...
I don't know if it's like,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.784
um, the hormones or what,

23:16.454 --> 23:18.421
but I just can't, um...

23:18.506 --> 23:21.841
I cannot shake this feeling

23:23.094 --> 23:24.594
like something's coming,

23:25.880 --> 23:27.580
something I'm not gonna like.

23:27.682 --> 23:29.632
Uh-uh. Nope.

23:29.718 --> 23:32.051
Nope, we're not doing that.

23:32.137 --> 23:33.720
Nope.

23:33.805 --> 23:35.655
That's how the world wants us.

23:37.192 --> 23:41.561
Got us so messed up
that we not even
trusting in joy.

23:43.615 --> 23:45.064
Well, we need to.

23:46.318 --> 23:47.516
Trust joy.

23:47.619 --> 23:50.870
You know,
I met this kid yesterday,

23:51.873 --> 23:53.406
his name was gabriel.

23:54.409 --> 23:59.862
It's funny 'cause that's
my mama's favorite angel
in the bible, yeah.

23:59.964 --> 24:02.799
He was living with his mommy
in a motel

24:02.884 --> 24:05.418
and the way that
he was clinging onto her just

24:06.638 --> 24:10.089
reminded me so much of me
at that age.

24:10.175 --> 24:13.259
Vi's been sort of on me
about going through
my mama's things, so,

24:14.012 --> 24:15.511
the other day,

24:15.597 --> 24:18.014
I did and I found this hat

24:18.099 --> 24:19.982
that reminded me of a time

24:20.819 --> 24:22.435
when my mama went hat shopping

24:23.321 --> 24:25.071
and this white saleslady

24:26.191 --> 24:27.573
wouldn't even
let her try it on.

24:29.027 --> 24:32.995
I was hugging up
on my mother's hips,

24:36.368 --> 24:40.420
'cause to me,
she was everything
in the world.

24:42.540 --> 24:44.040
But to that woman,

24:46.428 --> 24:48.010
she was nothin'.

24:53.601 --> 24:56.102
Some people are just bad news.

24:56.971 --> 24:59.055
Billie was
one of those people.

24:59.140 --> 25:00.640
Ralph angel,

25:00.725 --> 25:04.310
he always talked
about billie, like, um,

25:04.396 --> 25:06.696
like she was
a third sister back
in the day.

25:06.781 --> 25:08.948
He was so young,
he wouldn't know.

25:10.452 --> 25:14.404
You two were
almost inseparable,
what happened?

25:14.489 --> 25:18.157
I'll just say
when someone shows you
who they are,

25:18.259 --> 25:20.543
-believe them the first time.
-[charley] mmm.

25:20.628 --> 25:22.662
She caused a lot of
damage for me.

25:25.133 --> 25:26.466
And for me.

25:29.254 --> 25:32.538
There was a rumor that

25:32.640 --> 25:35.892
billie was messing around
with jimmy dale
while we were married.

25:36.227 --> 25:37.844
Oh.

25:37.929 --> 25:40.062
I mean, he was always
disrespecting me,

25:41.149 --> 25:44.350
chasing any and every skirt,

25:46.938 --> 25:48.020
but that one,

25:49.557 --> 25:51.290
it almost broke me.

25:53.495 --> 25:55.578
I mean,
the girl was like family.

25:57.332 --> 26:00.500
Some things and some people
should remain in your past.

26:07.342 --> 26:09.041
[ralph] hey, man.

26:09.127 --> 26:10.126
It's good to see you, bruh.

26:10.211 --> 26:11.794
-Good to see you, too, bruh.
-For real.

26:11.880 --> 26:15.097
Look, you good?
You looked stressed
back there.

26:15.183 --> 26:16.716
Just got a lot on my mind.

26:16.801 --> 26:17.967
I'm straight.

26:18.052 --> 26:20.937
Man go for money problems
or woman problems.

26:21.022 --> 26:23.940
Ain't no woman problems.
A lot with the baby coming.

26:24.025 --> 26:25.391
I got you.

26:25.477 --> 26:27.009
If you need me to, you know,

26:27.111 --> 26:29.445
get you a little something
while you wait on that money,
I can help, bruh.

26:30.648 --> 26:32.949
In fact, I got a way
you can make some cash.

26:34.152 --> 26:35.785
Nah, t.

26:35.870 --> 26:36.903
I'm out that life now.

26:36.988 --> 26:38.854
Me, too. That's why
I'm telling you about this.

26:38.957 --> 26:40.456
It's easy, it's an inside job

26:40.542 --> 26:42.492
where you ain't gotta
get out of the van.

26:42.577 --> 26:46.629
We unload the truck,
you drive it off,
it's that simple.

26:46.714 --> 26:49.031
-What's in the truck?
-It's computer equipment.

26:49.133 --> 26:50.666
They store it for, like,
an office or something,

26:50.752 --> 26:52.668
which means ain't
nobody gonna miss it.

26:52.754 --> 26:55.004
It's a warehouse called,
um, landry industries.

26:55.089 --> 26:56.839
-Landry?
-Yeah.

26:56.925 --> 26:58.090
I know that family.

26:59.394 --> 27:01.093
I ain't tryin' to get
mixed up with them.

27:01.179 --> 27:02.478
Look, I appreciate
you, though.

27:03.314 --> 27:05.815
Ain't hurt to ask, man.

27:05.900 --> 27:08.818
-All right,
it was good to see you, boy.
-Bruh.

27:08.903 --> 27:10.987
Too good. Good to see you,
big homie.

27:11.072 --> 27:13.022
-You stay up, brother.
-Man, drive safe.

27:13.107 --> 27:14.657
I will.

27:14.742 --> 27:16.108
I got a little something
for you, man.

27:16.194 --> 27:17.827
-Man, no.
-Yeah.

27:20.615 --> 27:22.398
[ralph] no.

27:22.500 --> 27:24.033
It's a gift
for the baby, all right?

27:26.538 --> 27:28.921
[door opens, closes]

27:35.263 --> 27:36.345
[sighs]

27:39.234 --> 27:42.068
I think that I speak
for both myself and my husband

27:42.186 --> 27:43.903
when I say that
we loved meeting you.

27:44.022 --> 27:45.238
And we would
really like for you

27:45.356 --> 27:47.607
to help us bring
our baby girl into the world
as our doula.

27:47.692 --> 27:49.659
[sarah] oh, I would love that.

27:49.744 --> 27:51.777
-You will be amazing parents.
-Thank you.

27:54.532 --> 27:56.666
Have you decided
on your midwife?

27:56.751 --> 27:58.034
I thought you was the midwife.

27:58.119 --> 27:59.869
[darla] do we need both?

27:59.954 --> 28:03.589
We work together,
but the midwife
has more medical expertise.

28:03.708 --> 28:06.042
And her focus is
on the health of the baby,

28:06.127 --> 28:08.761
while I focus on the mom,
on you.

28:08.880 --> 28:10.379
[ralph] gotcha.

28:10.465 --> 28:11.764
That sounds expensive.

28:11.883 --> 28:13.248
Does sound expensive.

28:13.351 --> 28:16.719
Well, if you have insurance,
generally they'll cover
some of it.

28:17.722 --> 28:19.472
[ralph sighs]

28:20.224 --> 28:22.174
look, let me put together
some recommendations,

28:22.277 --> 28:24.477
and send them over,
and we could keep talking.

28:25.980 --> 28:27.280
[darla] okay.

28:28.983 --> 28:30.066
[ralph] thank you for coming.

28:33.237 --> 28:34.403
[darla sighs]

28:35.323 --> 28:37.490
-[car door closes]
-[engine starts]

28:46.000 --> 28:48.117
maybe we should just
have the baby at the hospital.

28:49.170 --> 28:51.453
I want you to have the
birth experience you want,

28:52.140 --> 28:53.422
not just the one
we could afford.

28:53.508 --> 28:55.591
I appreciate that but, I mean,

28:55.677 --> 28:57.226
is the harvest really
gonna cover all of that?

28:57.312 --> 29:01.013
I mean,
the expenses are piling up
and that doula is not cheap.

29:03.484 --> 29:06.285
The harvest
is not really booming
like I want it to by now.

29:08.323 --> 29:10.356
-But when the remedy
checks come in--
-if they come in.

29:10.458 --> 29:11.691
They will.

29:11.776 --> 29:13.359
We already maxed out
on payday loans,

29:13.444 --> 29:16.529
I mean, maybe we need
to just like swallow our pride

29:16.631 --> 29:18.948
-and ask for help.
-Darla,

29:20.201 --> 29:21.917
don't give up on me.

29:22.003 --> 29:23.369
I just need
a little more time.

29:23.938 --> 29:25.037
All right?

29:27.108 --> 29:29.458
I know,
we're in this together.

29:29.544 --> 29:31.210
-Are you sure?
-We'll figure it out.

29:31.312 --> 29:32.545
All right.

29:36.551 --> 29:39.802
It's the mix of passion
and protest that gets me.

29:39.887 --> 29:41.470
You know, but you can't
just watch the film.

29:41.556 --> 29:43.789
You have to read
baldwin's words.

29:43.891 --> 29:45.424
[micah] holy shit!

29:45.526 --> 29:46.759
[woman over radio]
<i> all available reports...</i>

29:46.861 --> 29:47.893
[man] scared the crap
out of me.

29:49.063 --> 29:50.229
[groans]

29:51.866 --> 29:53.799
[panting]

29:56.154 --> 29:57.486
[man] micah.

29:58.156 --> 29:59.905
Breathe, man.

30:02.410 --> 30:03.743
Oh.

30:05.163 --> 30:06.629
Where is he?

30:06.714 --> 30:09.181
-[man] who?
-[micah] the cop, the cop.

30:12.186 --> 30:13.886
Micah, I think you're
having a panic attack.

30:13.988 --> 30:15.421
Have you had one before?

30:16.841 --> 30:18.057
-No, no.
-Okay.

30:18.159 --> 30:19.925
You're gonna be okay.

30:20.011 --> 30:23.012
-Just, just take slow,
deep breaths.
-I can't, I can't breathe.

30:23.097 --> 30:25.264
-It's just a security guard.
-[micah panting]

30:25.349 --> 30:26.849
no one's here.

30:27.852 --> 30:29.068
Micah, look at me.

30:30.354 --> 30:31.353
Breathe.

30:31.439 --> 30:33.072
[breathes heavily]

30:38.246 --> 30:39.528
should I call someone?

30:41.049 --> 30:42.948
No, just stay right there
right there for sec.

30:44.368 --> 30:46.085
[sobs]

30:46.204 --> 30:48.370
just breathe.

30:56.764 --> 30:58.097
Hello, beautiful.

30:58.716 --> 30:59.965
[violet] mmm.

31:01.102 --> 31:02.551
Oh, yeah.

31:03.304 --> 31:04.603
[hollywood] you know what?

31:05.306 --> 31:06.889
I got one of those.

31:07.608 --> 31:08.891
Only bigger.

31:08.976 --> 31:10.309
How big?

31:10.394 --> 31:12.478
Well, it's big enough
for me to ride.

31:12.563 --> 31:13.696
[gabriel] whoa.

31:13.781 --> 31:15.731
-That's cool, huh?
-Yeah.

31:17.318 --> 31:19.568
-You want me
to fix that for you?
-Okay.

31:28.246 --> 31:29.995
-Magic.
-[celine] look at that.

31:30.081 --> 31:31.247
How'd you do that?

31:31.332 --> 31:33.048
-What are you gonna say?
Come on.
-Thank you.

31:33.134 --> 31:34.333
Oh, you're welcome.

31:36.337 --> 31:38.087
[laughter]

31:42.510 --> 31:43.592
yay.

31:49.267 --> 31:50.432
[car door closes]

31:57.525 --> 31:58.691
is prosper inside?

31:58.776 --> 32:00.776
Promised I'd bring him
some of vi's leftovers.

32:01.946 --> 32:03.445
He's sleeping.

32:04.115 --> 32:05.414
Oh.

32:05.500 --> 32:08.784
Okay, well,
could you give him this
and tell him I came by?

32:08.870 --> 32:10.035
Sure.

32:14.125 --> 32:16.625
You know it's childish that
we don't talk about things.

32:19.130 --> 32:20.713
How would you like to start?

32:20.798 --> 32:22.298
You could try an apology.

32:25.553 --> 32:27.019
We were kids.

32:27.138 --> 32:28.554
It was an accident.

32:28.639 --> 32:29.939
An accident?

32:30.024 --> 32:32.391
What you said
to my father damaged
my relationship with him

32:32.476 --> 32:33.792
for the rest of his life.

32:36.147 --> 32:37.613
He never looked
at me the same.

32:37.698 --> 32:40.449
We were 18,
we both did things back then.

32:40.535 --> 32:42.368
No, you don't get
to get off that easy.

32:42.470 --> 32:44.537
You knew exactly
what you were doing,
that's what made it worse.

32:44.639 --> 32:46.655
You did it on purpose.

32:46.741 --> 32:48.490
Nova, I don't remember
all the details.

32:48.576 --> 32:51.126
All I remember is that
I was hurting.

32:51.212 --> 32:52.661
And you hurt me, too.

32:54.332 --> 32:58.083
You told my father
you were worried about my soul
because I might be gay.

33:00.004 --> 33:01.554
You outed me, billie.

33:04.008 --> 33:07.142
I came home to questions
I wasn't prepared to answer,

33:07.228 --> 33:09.011
for me or for myself.

33:09.096 --> 33:11.897
And for you to sit here
and say that
it happened accidentally

33:13.067 --> 33:14.233
is vile.

33:15.186 --> 33:16.902
Vile?

33:17.021 --> 33:18.520
No, I'll tell you what's vile.

33:20.074 --> 33:22.691
Abandoning your best friend
when she needed you the most.

33:22.777 --> 33:24.159
When did I abandon you,
billie?

33:24.245 --> 33:25.494
Me and jimmy dale.

33:25.580 --> 33:26.679
Oh, so the rumor is true.

33:26.781 --> 33:27.863
Ah, you...

33:28.950 --> 33:31.750
You are so high
and mighty on tv

33:31.869 --> 33:33.535
and in your books
and in your articles,

33:33.621 --> 33:36.755
crusading for justice
and women's rights,

33:38.626 --> 33:40.676
but you couldn't see
then or now

33:40.761 --> 33:42.211
what is really happening.

33:44.265 --> 33:48.133
I was 18 years old, nova.

33:48.219 --> 33:51.770
He was over 33.
There was no me
and jimmy dale.

33:51.872 --> 33:54.773
There was a
30-something-year-old man
going around town

33:54.892 --> 33:57.860
telling people
that an 18-year-old senior
in high school

33:57.945 --> 33:59.278
was good in bed.

34:00.615 --> 34:02.114
And not one of you,

34:03.567 --> 34:07.486
not my best friend,
or anyone in her family

34:07.571 --> 34:10.406
thought to inquire
about the circumstances.

34:10.491 --> 34:12.207
What are you saying, billie?

34:12.293 --> 34:13.659
I'm saying

34:14.428 --> 34:17.796
the same thing that
I wanted to tell you then.

34:18.633 --> 34:22.584
I tried to tell violet
and my father

34:23.170 --> 34:24.837
and everybody back then.

34:28.009 --> 34:29.475
It wasn't my choice.

34:32.647 --> 34:34.096
But nobody would listen.

34:35.650 --> 34:37.599
[crying] nobody.

34:37.685 --> 34:40.586
So, as soon as
I graduated, I left.

34:42.106 --> 34:44.823
And on my way out,
I stepped by the farm

34:44.942 --> 34:47.359
to speak with your father
to see if he would listen.

34:48.829 --> 34:50.195
And he did.

34:51.198 --> 34:53.949
And he was so kind, nova.

34:56.120 --> 34:57.953
I think he might have
even believed me.

35:00.341 --> 35:01.623
I saw in him

35:02.460 --> 35:03.625
a good person.

35:05.463 --> 35:07.012
A father who listened,

35:09.633 --> 35:11.183
and mine didn't,

35:12.853 --> 35:16.138
and that made me so, so sad,

35:17.224 --> 35:18.724
and mad.

35:20.194 --> 35:22.478
And I didn't want you to have
what I didn't have.

35:24.899 --> 35:26.865
So I told him you liked girls.

35:31.322 --> 35:33.489
Just to fight back
what was happening to me.

35:35.910 --> 35:38.327
I left this town
and I never looked back.

35:44.001 --> 35:45.000
[door slams]

35:50.007 --> 35:53.008
to you,
for picking up the pieces,

35:54.061 --> 35:57.730
making amends,
humbling yourself,

35:57.848 --> 36:00.933
studying, networking,

36:01.018 --> 36:05.771
stepping out on faith,
and nailing the job,

36:05.856 --> 36:09.408
mr. New head coach
of the los angeles dynasty.

36:09.527 --> 36:11.527
Thank you,
thank you, thank you.

36:11.612 --> 36:13.695
And to you,

36:15.866 --> 36:18.367
for not letting
my mistakes take you down,

36:19.754 --> 36:21.420
for rising above the mess,

36:21.539 --> 36:24.757
for coming here
and helping your family,

36:25.376 --> 36:27.259
finding a greater cause,

36:27.378 --> 36:31.547
for running
and winning an election,

36:31.632 --> 36:33.465
and grabbing the attention
of the party.

36:33.551 --> 36:37.970
Baby,
you are the hottest emerging
black woman political figure

36:38.055 --> 36:39.972
in the country right now.

36:41.392 --> 36:43.525
-The sky's the limit.
-For both of us.

36:43.611 --> 36:45.110
-Mm-hmm.
-[glasses clink]

36:49.733 --> 36:51.150
[davis] mmm.

36:53.237 --> 36:54.319
Wow.

36:54.405 --> 36:56.071
-Hmm.
-[davis sighs]

36:59.743 --> 37:02.244
-you don't get stars
like this everywhere.
-Mmm.

37:02.329 --> 37:03.712
This is something special

37:03.798 --> 37:05.964
I only see in places
where there's no smog,

37:06.083 --> 37:07.666
-or city lights.
-Hmm.

37:11.422 --> 37:13.305
Would you give
this all up for politics?

37:15.810 --> 37:17.759
I'm not giving up
anything anymore.

37:20.014 --> 37:22.264
-I want it all.
-Mm-hmm.

37:24.602 --> 37:26.485
See, that's what I love
about you.

37:27.188 --> 37:29.104
Fearlessness.

37:29.190 --> 37:30.856
I got to admit,
I'm a little scared about

37:30.941 --> 37:34.409
what the feedback will be once
my announcement goes up.

37:34.495 --> 37:37.746
I hate that it's something
you got to think about
while dealing with the party.

37:37.832 --> 37:41.667
We'll get out ahead of it
and control
what they're saying.

37:41.785 --> 37:45.170
The party,
the sports press will think
what we want them to think.

37:45.623 --> 37:46.955
Remember,

37:47.791 --> 37:51.126
we set the tone and this,

37:51.795 --> 37:53.295
us,

37:54.298 --> 37:55.797
we're a feel-good story.

37:56.967 --> 37:58.667
Golden couple

37:59.470 --> 38:01.386
who lost themselves
in the fame,

38:02.139 --> 38:04.022
separated,

38:04.141 --> 38:06.275
found themselves separately,

38:06.360 --> 38:09.311
and reunited
to be stronger than ever.

38:09.864 --> 38:11.313
[chuckles]

38:12.149 --> 38:13.982
I swear, charley, you...

38:15.319 --> 38:17.653
You have such a gift
with this kind of stuff

38:17.738 --> 38:19.321
'cause you make
it sound so easy.

38:22.209 --> 38:24.243
But I don't want
to lean on you,

38:24.328 --> 38:26.545
to rehabilitate my image.

38:26.664 --> 38:27.829
I don't even want an image.

38:28.999 --> 38:31.633
I just want to go
about my work quietly,

38:31.719 --> 38:33.502
contribute to a good team,

38:34.672 --> 38:36.505
enjoy the games,
and come home to you.

38:38.559 --> 38:39.841
I don't need the other stuff.

38:41.595 --> 38:43.395
I want people to see you

38:44.348 --> 38:45.764
the way I see you.

38:52.406 --> 38:54.439
I only care how you see me.

38:54.525 --> 38:55.908
I want you to be proud of me.

38:58.612 --> 39:01.697
You know,
go back to california,
excel at this job,

39:02.750 --> 39:05.083
fix up our house,
and make it a home again.

39:08.789 --> 39:10.622
Would you ever
consider moving back?

39:16.764 --> 39:18.714
My life is in st. Jo now.

39:20.100 --> 39:22.551
I have a calling,
a community here.

39:26.106 --> 39:30.976
But long weekends
in la with you
sound magnificent.

39:31.061 --> 39:32.311
They do.

39:36.567 --> 39:38.367
In the meantime,

39:38.452 --> 39:41.286
we're gonna have some bumps
in the road to smooth over

39:41.388 --> 39:42.921
for both of us.

39:44.758 --> 39:47.009
-Leave the image stuff to me.
-Yep.

39:48.095 --> 39:49.595
No time like the present,
right?

39:50.681 --> 39:51.964
Come on.

39:54.768 --> 39:56.351
[davis sighs]

39:56.437 --> 39:57.719
oh, we're doing this?

39:57.805 --> 39:59.471
-We're doing this.
-Oh.

40:00.557 --> 40:01.890
[camera clicks]

40:03.060 --> 40:04.860
okay, what's the caption?

40:04.945 --> 40:10.065

40:11.068 --> 40:12.484
[phone pings]

40:15.039 --> 40:16.788
wow. It's working.

40:21.996 --> 40:23.412
Pick me up.

40:30.087 --> 40:32.220
-It's all gonna be okay.
-Mmm.
