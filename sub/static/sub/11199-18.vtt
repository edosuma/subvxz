WEBVTT

00:24.171 --> 00:26.105
Sorry, sir. I just saw
you were with someone.

00:26.173 --> 00:28.164
I didn't wanna interrupt.

00:28.241 --> 00:31.039
- What's up?
- Who was that?

00:31.111 --> 00:36.981
- Kerry Johnson, CIA.
- I've heard the name.

00:37.050 --> 00:38.984
She was heading up
the investigation...

00:39.052 --> 00:41.885
into Goa'ulds still at large
after the incident with The Trust.

00:41.955 --> 00:46.654
- Yeah.
- Sir, I wanted to talk to you about-

00:46.727 --> 00:49.491
- Carter-
- We haven't heard from him in a week.

00:49.563 --> 00:53.260
- Doesn't mean anything.
- We know he was captured by Replicators.

00:53.333 --> 00:55.927
Chances are he was on board
a Replicator ship when it disintegrated.

00:56.002 --> 00:58.698
All we know for sure
is that he's missing.

01:00.140 --> 01:02.267
- Sooner or later-
- Forget it.

01:02.342 --> 01:04.537
How many times
have you thought he was gone...

01:04.611 --> 01:07.478
and then he shows up...

01:07.547 --> 01:10.072
in one form or another?

01:10.150 --> 01:14.280
I'm sorry, but we're not having a memorial
service for someone who is not dead.

01:14.354 --> 01:18.916
For all we know, he's gonna come waltzing
through that door right now.

01:21.094 --> 01:22.584
Waltzing.

01:24.231 --> 01:25.721
Now.

02:09.309 --> 02:12.472
Son, what can I get for you?

03:31.892 --> 03:33.883
Thank you, Airman.

03:35.428 --> 03:37.555
So, this is exciting.

03:37.631 --> 03:39.599
- What's the surprise?
- You'll see.

03:44.170 --> 03:46.968
Pete Shanahan, Jacob Carter.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.838
Dad, this is Pete.

03:49.910 --> 03:52.640
- Dad.
- Not quite yet.

03:52.712 --> 03:55.875
You have to actually marry my daughter
before you can call me that.

03:55.949 --> 03:59.407
It's an honor
to meet you, sir, really.

03:59.486 --> 04:01.511
Do you really got one of
those things in your head?

04:02.689 --> 04:07.524
If by "one of those things," you mean
a 2,000-year-old Tok'ra symbiote, yes.

04:07.594 --> 04:09.585
Seriously. Come on.

04:09.663 --> 04:12.530
That has got to freak you
right out sometimes.

04:12.599 --> 04:14.533
It's weird.

04:22.175 --> 04:25.008
What do I have to do
to get some more coffee around here?

04:25.078 --> 04:27.308
Find true enlightenment.

04:32.118 --> 04:34.177
- No menus?
- We don't need them here.

04:34.254 --> 04:37.712
- Just order what you'd like.
- Waffles.

04:37.791 --> 04:39.725
Bacon on the side?

04:39.793 --> 04:42.785
- No. I remember this place.
- You should. It came from your mind.

04:44.230 --> 04:46.391
My grandfather brought me here
after my parents' funeral.

04:46.466 --> 04:48.900
- I had waffles.
- Waffles it is.

04:48.969 --> 04:50.459
Wait.

04:51.738 --> 04:55.139
How do I know
it's really you this time?

04:55.208 --> 04:57.608
How do I know this isn't some trick
Replicator Sam's playing...

04:57.677 --> 04:59.338
to stop me from controlling her?

05:01.548 --> 05:04.779
How deep is the river
if you cannot see the bottom?

05:04.851 --> 05:08.150
Deeper than the coffee
in my cup, I'll tell you that.

05:09.422 --> 05:12.858
Excuse me. Frank,
I need a Noah's boy in a blanket...

05:12.926 --> 05:16.020
two hen fruit, wrecked on a shingle
with a mystery in the alley...

05:16.096 --> 05:21.124
a warm eve with a moldy lid
and two checkerboards, all right?

05:21.201 --> 05:22.862
Oh, yeah, hold the pig.

05:29.109 --> 05:31.441
Hey, I know you.

05:31.511 --> 05:33.376
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:33.446 --> 05:36.609
The guy from the paper,
Dr. Daniel Jackson.

05:42.689 --> 05:44.987
That's okay. Keep it.
I'm done.

05:45.058 --> 05:47.049
- Thanks.
- No problem.

06:02.776 --> 06:05.108
So, are you gonna visit
Mark and the kids this trip?

06:05.178 --> 06:06.668
Tomorrow.

06:08.181 --> 06:10.172
Is everything okay?

06:11.685 --> 06:15.678
- I'm just not very hungry.
- You've been pretty quiet.

06:17.957 --> 06:22.417
- I'm fine.
- Dad-

06:24.864 --> 06:27.162
What?

06:27.233 --> 06:29.895
It's been two hours since Pete left.
You haven't said a word.

06:29.969 --> 06:32.733
- I did so.
- "He seems nice"?

06:32.806 --> 06:35.900
- I believe that's three words.
- I'm gonna marry him.

06:35.975 --> 06:37.636
I know.

06:39.145 --> 06:41.705
I just met him.
What do you want me to say?

06:44.584 --> 06:46.848
I know how happy
he makes you.

06:46.920 --> 06:48.888
That's all that matters to me.

07:01.935 --> 07:04.199
- You know about this?
- Yes.

07:04.270 --> 07:07.637
- You're not gonna do anything about it?
- You know I can't.

07:07.707 --> 07:10.733
I'm certainly not just gonna
sit here and let this happen.

07:17.050 --> 07:19.211
You can't leave.
You're not ascended yet.

07:20.954 --> 07:23.422
You walk through that door,
you're choosing the alternative.

07:25.058 --> 07:28.152
- You're saying I'll be dead.
- Pretty much.

07:30.196 --> 07:32.255
Okay, ascend me.

07:33.233 --> 07:35.929
It doesn't mean you'll be able
to help your friends.

07:37.237 --> 07:39.262
- You know the rules.
- Yes, but once I'm ascended...

07:39.339 --> 07:42.069
I can choose to take human form again,
just like last time.

07:42.142 --> 07:44.804
Technically, yes.

07:44.878 --> 07:47.005
But you can't take
that paper with you.

07:47.080 --> 07:49.412
You won't have any of the knowledge
that you've gained here.

07:49.482 --> 07:51.347
And good luck ever ascending again.

07:51.417 --> 07:54.011
I'm certainly not going
to help you a third time.

07:54.788 --> 07:56.779
You're saying I can know Anubis
is plotting to destroy...

07:56.856 --> 07:59.723
all life in the galaxy,
and all I can do about it...

07:59.793 --> 08:03.524
is stay here and contemplate
my own enlightenment?

08:03.596 --> 08:05.757
You can eat your waffles.

08:13.139 --> 08:16.199
I still wish you guys had blown that
thing up when you had the chance.

08:16.276 --> 08:19.609
We had to at least be sure that all
the Replicators really were eliminated.

08:19.679 --> 08:22.648
Great. Well, now the Jaffa
have something...

08:22.715 --> 08:25.650
that can blow up the entire universe
with the push of a button.

08:27.020 --> 08:29.511
The Jaffa will defend Dakara
with their lives.

08:29.589 --> 08:32.524
You want to explain to me
why they don't want to wreck it?

08:33.993 --> 08:36.689
The ruins at Dakara have
become a symbol of freedom.

08:36.763 --> 08:39.357
Much more, the Jaffa believe
that the device's power...

08:39.432 --> 08:42.697
helped free them
by destroying the Replicators.

08:42.769 --> 08:46.762
They also believe that power will help
ensure their freedom in the future.

08:46.840 --> 08:49.809
And get them
virtually anything they want.

08:49.876 --> 08:52.401
The Jaffa would never
use it to that end.

08:52.478 --> 08:56.244
Jack is right. No one should have
that kind of power at their disposal.

09:02.188 --> 09:04.122
Can you sit a minute?

09:04.190 --> 09:05.680
Okay.

09:08.094 --> 09:10.028
How am I supposed to put it?

09:11.231 --> 09:13.165
Man, are my dogs tired.

09:16.336 --> 09:18.930
Can you tell me why you stopped me
from killing Anubis...

09:19.005 --> 09:21.269
the last time I was ascended?

09:22.442 --> 09:24.842
Because if I didn't stop you,
the Others would have...

09:24.911 --> 09:26.902
and they wouldn't have been
as nice about it.

09:26.980 --> 09:29.881
You mean, they wouldn't have erased
my memory and left me naked on a planet?

09:29.949 --> 09:34.443
That was your choice.
Okay, maybe not the naked part.

09:35.521 --> 09:38.922
But I didn't totally erase your memory,
even though I was supposed to.

09:38.992 --> 09:42.359
There. Why is it okay to break
some rules and not others?

09:46.966 --> 09:49.491
If you knew I had a problem
following the rules the last time...

09:49.569 --> 09:51.230
why offer me ascension again?

09:55.041 --> 09:57.100
Because I didn't
want to see you die...

09:57.176 --> 09:59.610
without at least
giving you a second chance.

10:00.647 --> 10:03.445
Look, I have trouble
following the rules.

10:03.516 --> 10:06.644
I'm not really supposed
to help people ascend.

10:06.719 --> 10:08.653
You're supposed to
do it on your own.

10:08.721 --> 10:10.985
But you do it.

10:11.057 --> 10:13.992
I walk the line.
Believe me...

10:14.060 --> 10:17.757
I crossed it a few times
and paid for it dearly.

10:20.967 --> 10:24.027
My point is,
you just need to be willing...

10:24.103 --> 10:28.335
to put your prior human
existence into the proper context.

10:30.743 --> 10:34.372
The council remains unwilling
to destroy the weapon...

10:34.447 --> 10:36.847
for fear it will weaken
the resolve of the Jaffa...

10:36.916 --> 10:39.384
to stand united against
the remaining Goa'uld.

10:39.452 --> 10:43.115
You realize we have to consider
that thing a threat to our security?

10:43.189 --> 10:44.781
Indeed.

10:44.857 --> 10:48.850
The council recognizes the danger
and has decided to take action...

10:48.928 --> 10:51.522
by aggressively seeking out
and killing Anubis.

10:52.298 --> 10:54.926
Once that threat
has been eliminated...

10:55.001 --> 10:58.061
they will reassess the decision
to destroy the device.

10:58.137 --> 11:01.470
We don't even know if Anubis
can be killed yet, do we?

11:01.541 --> 11:03.941
We must not suggest
to the Jaffa that he cannot be.

11:04.010 --> 11:07.639
At the very least, we can eliminate
the remainder of the forces of Anubis.

11:08.548 --> 11:12.040
I believe this quest will unite
many of the still-fractured armies...

11:12.118 --> 11:14.348
by giving them focus
on a common goal.

11:14.420 --> 11:15.978
Got anything to go on?

11:18.324 --> 11:21.521
Many of the Kull warriors were killed
in battle with the Replicators...

11:21.594 --> 11:23.619
but intelligence gathered
indicates that Anubis...

11:23.696 --> 11:27.188
may be marshaling the remaining
Kull warriors on Tartarus.

11:27.266 --> 11:29.530
A preemptive strike
is being prepared.

11:39.145 --> 11:41.170
Yes, you did, Jim.

11:53.226 --> 11:56.753
- How's it going?
- Do we know each other?

11:56.829 --> 11:59.696
- I feel like I know you.
- Call me Jim.

11:59.766 --> 12:02.234
We ran into each other
the last time you were ascended.

12:03.236 --> 12:05.204
Nice to meet you again.

12:06.606 --> 12:08.597
You still haven't made up
your mind, huh?

12:08.674 --> 12:11.905
Death or everlasting enlightenment?

12:11.978 --> 12:14.310
Don't really see the choice myself.

12:14.380 --> 12:16.575
Of course,
I don't want to be dead.

12:19.352 --> 12:22.549
Listen, the reason I
came over here was to ask you-

12:23.990 --> 12:25.787
Why are you talking to me?

12:27.360 --> 12:30.295
You mean, because these other snobs
won't even look at you?

12:30.363 --> 12:32.627
- Yeah.
- I'm different.

12:32.698 --> 12:34.928
- Like Oma.
- Really?

12:35.001 --> 12:37.936
Because I kind of had the impression
that you two don't quite see eye to eye.

12:38.004 --> 12:41.496
What, that little-
That was nothing.

12:45.812 --> 12:50.146
We both operate somewhat
outside the normal rules and regulations.

12:50.216 --> 12:54.915
Sometimes we disagree on how far
outside we should go. That's all.

12:54.987 --> 12:57.751
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:57.824 --> 13:02.261
As long as these other guys
don't strike me down, I figure I'm okay.

13:05.064 --> 13:07.430
I just don't see how I
can agree to stand by...

13:07.500 --> 13:11.266
and let Anubis destroy
every living thing in the entire galaxy.

13:12.738 --> 13:14.672
I know.

13:14.740 --> 13:16.731
That's a tough one.

13:20.680 --> 13:23.080
Speaking of which,
have you seen the latest?

13:32.058 --> 13:36.154
He's a crafty one. Really knows
the ins and outs of the rules.

13:36.229 --> 13:39.027
I give him three-to-one odds
to succeed.

13:39.098 --> 13:41.032
Want to know
the irony of it all?

13:41.834 --> 13:45.770
That device was originally
used by the Ancients...

13:45.838 --> 13:48.306
to create life
in the Milky Way.

13:48.374 --> 13:53.243
Well, re-create it,
after the whole plague thing.

13:53.312 --> 13:54.802
No kidding.

13:56.082 --> 13:59.142
Now it all gets undone
with the push of one button...

13:59.218 --> 14:03.587
leaving Anubis to re-create
things all over to his own liking.

14:03.656 --> 14:07.057
There's a waste of a million-odd
years of evolution, huh?

14:09.795 --> 14:13.390
I say someone should really
do something to stop him!

14:17.570 --> 14:19.561
No one will.

14:21.974 --> 14:23.965
Can I get a coffee?

14:32.418 --> 14:35.182
- Can I open them now?
- Almost.

14:40.059 --> 14:41.549
Now.

14:43.596 --> 14:45.587
What do you think?

14:47.233 --> 14:48.393
Well-

14:49.202 --> 14:51.432
- Speechless, huh?
- Yeah. Yeah.

14:51.504 --> 14:54.837
Isn't it great?
Remember our first night together?

14:54.907 --> 14:57.137
You described
the house you always wanted.

14:57.210 --> 14:58.871
I can't believe this.

14:58.945 --> 15:01.175
The kitchen isn't yellow,
but we can paint.

15:01.247 --> 15:03.545
Come on. I'll show you.

15:03.616 --> 15:05.607
And you're not gonna
believe the backyard.

15:05.685 --> 15:07.619
The dog's gonna love it.

15:07.687 --> 15:09.177
Dog?

15:14.927 --> 15:16.861
Is there anything you can do
to stop Anubis?

15:16.929 --> 15:19.625
I mean, you did say
someone should do something.

15:19.699 --> 15:21.690
I did, didn't I?

15:23.202 --> 15:27.104
Well, as far as what can be done,
it's kind of complicated.

15:27.873 --> 15:29.807
Yeah, so Oma tells me.

15:31.043 --> 15:33.341
Yeah, well, I don't think
she's told you everything.

15:33.412 --> 15:35.437
- What does that mean?
- I'm saying-

15:37.750 --> 15:40.344
- I've already said too much.
- No, you haven't.

15:40.419 --> 15:42.410
In fact, you've hardly said
anything at all.

15:43.522 --> 15:46.753
You rejected everything
Oma offered you...

15:46.826 --> 15:50.455
and now she just gives you another chance,
based on the goodness of her heart?

15:51.497 --> 15:54.466
Well, that is the point, isn't it?
I mean, she's ascended. She is good.

15:55.301 --> 15:57.235
Sure. Best intentions.

15:57.303 --> 15:59.533
Do you know what happened
between me and Oma?

15:59.605 --> 16:01.266
Why did I choose
to take human form again?

16:04.510 --> 16:06.171
You should ask Oma.

16:19.959 --> 16:23.759
- Hi, sir.
- Carter.

16:23.829 --> 16:26.423
Look, I'm sorry to bother
you at home like this, but-

16:26.499 --> 16:29.593
- How'd you know I was here?
- I saw the smoke.

16:31.070 --> 16:33.163
Yeah.

16:33.239 --> 16:36.902
Look, is this okay?
I mean, I could've called first, but-

16:36.976 --> 16:39.809
No-Yeah.
I mean, it's fine.

16:40.646 --> 16:45.845
So, what brings you
to this neck of the woods...

16:45.918 --> 16:49.786
on such a fine day
in my backyard?

16:49.855 --> 16:54.121
Well, actually, I've been sitting in
your driveway for the last 10 minutes...

16:54.193 --> 16:56.127
trying to work up the nerve
to come and talk to you.

16:59.732 --> 17:04.066
The truth is, I've been trying to work up
the nerve for a lot longer than that.

17:08.774 --> 17:12.005
- Pete put a down payment on a house.
- Well, that's great.

17:13.946 --> 17:18.349
- It's a beautiful house.
- But?

17:20.586 --> 17:23.578
The truth is, I'm having second thoughts
about the wedding.

17:25.991 --> 17:28.289
- Why?
- The thing is, the closer it gets...

17:28.361 --> 17:33.230
the more I get the feeling
that I'm making a big huge mistake.

17:34.433 --> 17:36.367
Look, Carter-

17:36.435 --> 17:39.836
I'm sorry to bother
you with this, but...

17:39.905 --> 17:43.272
see, there's actually a very good reason
that I am bothering you with this...

17:43.342 --> 17:46.903
and if I don't tell you now,
I might never-

17:46.979 --> 17:50.142
Jack, I looked everywhere.
I could not fi-

17:52.818 --> 17:55.252
Colonel Carter.

17:57.022 --> 17:59.456
- Ms. Johnson.
- Yeah.

17:59.525 --> 18:02.585
- I didn't-
- We were just meeting...

18:02.661 --> 18:05.289
here in my backyard
on this fine day...

18:05.364 --> 18:08.697
to discuss the state of affairs.

18:11.937 --> 18:15.065
- Well, this is awkward.
- You think?

18:16.642 --> 18:22.080
Jack didn't want anyone
at the SGC to know about us.

18:22.148 --> 18:26.585
No, look-
I'm sorry. This is my fault.

18:26.652 --> 18:29.018
I shouldn't have come by
unannounced like this.

18:30.689 --> 18:34.181
Well, you know,
now that the cat's out of the bag.

18:34.260 --> 18:36.990
You're here.
Why don't you just stay?

18:37.062 --> 18:40.156
I'm sure there's enough charred meat
on the grill for all three of us.

18:42.134 --> 18:44.398
No, thank you.

18:49.775 --> 18:51.766
It's the SGC.

18:53.479 --> 18:54.969
Colonel Carter.

18:59.185 --> 19:01.449
What? When?

19:03.789 --> 19:05.848
Okay, I'm on my way.

19:05.925 --> 19:08.621
I gotta go. It's my dad.

19:18.337 --> 19:20.862
Look, obviously
I don't want to just die.

19:22.174 --> 19:24.108
I don't suppose
there's any other options?

19:24.176 --> 19:26.110
I can't get into it.

19:26.178 --> 19:29.113
- What's stopping you from ascending?
- I don't know.

19:32.818 --> 19:35.446
There must be something holding
you back, making you doubt yourself.

19:36.288 --> 19:38.620
Maybe it's not me I'm doubting.

19:40.426 --> 19:43.418
Look, whether you
choose to accept living...

19:43.496 --> 19:46.329
on a higher plane of existence
has nothing to do with me...

19:46.398 --> 19:48.662
or anything that I
can or can't tell you.

19:49.602 --> 19:52.969
- It's all up to you.
- There is something you're not telling me.

19:53.038 --> 19:55.632
Is that whatJim said?
You shouldn't be listening to him.

19:55.708 --> 19:58.370
- Why not?
- Because.

19:58.444 --> 20:03.711
- Good answer.
- Yes.

20:05.017 --> 20:06.507
Dad?

20:08.153 --> 20:10.781
I'm sorry, kiddo.
We both are.

20:10.856 --> 20:13.017
About what?
What's going on?

20:13.092 --> 20:15.754
I didn't want to ruin
everything like this.

20:15.828 --> 20:17.762
Dad?

20:17.830 --> 20:20.025
It's Selmak. He's dying.

20:20.099 --> 20:22.363
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

20:22.434 --> 20:26.495
It's okay. He's okay.
He led a pretty full life.

20:26.572 --> 20:30.099
I didn't live with Jolinar that long, but
I think have some idea of what it's like.

20:30.175 --> 20:34.373
Well, this is a little different, Sam.

20:34.446 --> 20:36.471
As you know,
when a Tok'ra symbiote dies...

20:36.549 --> 20:41.043
they can prevent their host from dying,
as Jolinar did with you.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.987
The problem is,
that last selfless act...

20:44.056 --> 20:46.957
requires a certain amount of energy
and a conscious effort.

20:49.028 --> 20:52.395
- What are you saying?
- By all rights...

20:52.464 --> 20:55.262
Selmak should have been dead
weeks ago.

20:55.334 --> 20:57.495
I wouldn't let him go.

20:57.570 --> 20:59.231
I thought we needed him-

20:59.305 --> 21:02.638
that I needed him to
help you stop the Replicators.

21:03.642 --> 21:04.802
Dad-

21:07.046 --> 21:09.571
He hung on as long as he could.

21:09.648 --> 21:13.641
Then he slipped into a coma just after
we activated the weapon on Dakara.

21:14.987 --> 21:16.648
You've known all this time
since then?

21:19.358 --> 21:23.317
I didn't want to spoil your wedding.
You know, I thought we could make it.

21:27.399 --> 21:32.063
- We?
- He's barely alive.

21:36.809 --> 21:38.743
I'm gonna die with him, Sam.

21:52.257 --> 21:53.918
- Where is she?
- I don't know.

21:53.993 --> 21:56.587
Off doing whatever it is
she does when she's not here.

21:56.662 --> 21:58.152
- You ask her?
- Yep.

21:58.230 --> 22:00.221
- Wouldn't tell you?
- Nope.

22:01.634 --> 22:04.967
Had to find out for yourself
last time too.

22:05.037 --> 22:10.498
- Man, were you pissed.
- About what? Tell me.

22:16.682 --> 22:18.616
What do you know about Anubis?

22:19.818 --> 22:22.150
I know he's half-ascended,
whatever that means.

22:22.888 --> 22:25.322
There are many planes
of existence...

22:25.391 --> 22:27.621
between human existence
and ascension.

22:28.360 --> 22:32.126
Basically, the Others
use their collective powers...

22:32.197 --> 22:36.827
to keep him from affecting
anything on a grand cosmic level.

22:36.902 --> 22:38.893
But it's okay for him
to destroy an entire galaxy?

22:38.971 --> 22:41.337
It's okay for him to do
anything he could have done...

22:41.407 --> 22:43.739
back when he was
a regular old Goa'uld.

22:45.377 --> 22:47.311
I see. What does this
have to do with Oma?

22:48.080 --> 22:51.982
Goa'ulds are bad.
Anubis is as bad as they come.

22:53.552 --> 22:56.817
- And?
- And-

22:57.890 --> 23:00.188
And ascension requires that
somebody be pure of spirit.

23:00.259 --> 23:03.251
One must be good to the very core
to achieve enlightenment.

23:03.328 --> 23:07.128
- So how does someone like Anubis ascend?
- Now he's getting it.

23:07.199 --> 23:09.724
Oma helps people ascend, but she'd
never help somebody like Anubis.

23:09.802 --> 23:13.067
- Maybe not on purpose.
- You're saying he tricked her somehow?

23:13.138 --> 23:15.470
Rule number one-

23:15.541 --> 23:19.409
no lone ascended being
shall help a lower ascend.

23:19.478 --> 23:21.412
Lowers are what we call
humans and such.

23:22.181 --> 23:26.447
If you deserve to be here, you should
be able to get here on your own.

23:26.518 --> 23:29.453
If there's an exception,
for whatever reason...

23:29.521 --> 23:32.149
a majority vote by
the collective can get you in...

23:32.224 --> 23:36.183
but Oma thinks she knows better,
and she's taken her licks for it.

23:36.261 --> 23:39.196
I admit, for the most part,
she's brought good people on board.

23:39.264 --> 23:42.358
But as the old saying goes,
nobody's perfect...

23:42.434 --> 23:45.369
not even us higher beings.

23:48.040 --> 23:49.701
Oma helped Anubis ascend.

23:53.512 --> 23:57.312
Get out.
Get out now.

24:01.386 --> 24:06.255
Well, look at the time.
Got to go, kid. Business to attend to.

24:06.325 --> 24:08.657
It was nice talking to you though.

24:39.858 --> 24:41.917
A number of the Tok'ra have responded.

24:41.994 --> 24:45.589
- They want to pay their respects.
- They can come.

24:47.332 --> 24:49.266
I can't believe
there's nothing they can do.

24:51.503 --> 24:53.937
They can remove a Goa'uld.

24:54.006 --> 24:58.841
In the last few years, you've almost
perfected the process of saving a host.

24:58.911 --> 25:04.781
That process instantly kills
the symbiote before it releases toxins.

25:05.684 --> 25:08.517
It's too late for that, Sam.

25:08.587 --> 25:11.886
I'm sorry.
I hate to do this to you.

25:14.126 --> 25:16.060
But I should have been dead
four years ago.

25:18.997 --> 25:22.160
I just wanna know
you're gonna be happy.

25:23.368 --> 25:24.528
I am.

25:26.672 --> 25:32.008
- Don't let rules stand in your way.
- What are you talking about?

25:33.812 --> 25:39.011
- You joined the air force because of me.
- I love my job.

25:45.691 --> 25:50.355
You can still have
everything you want.

25:51.697 --> 25:53.187
I do, Dad.

26:01.540 --> 26:03.030
Really.

26:14.720 --> 26:19.521
- How's Colonel Carter's father?
- Doesn't look good.

26:20.592 --> 26:22.583
Sorry to hear that.

26:29.635 --> 26:31.569
Closing the door.

26:33.105 --> 26:35.039
Yeah.

26:35.107 --> 26:38.235
- Deeply symbolic.
- Really?

26:40.779 --> 26:43.907
I really like you.
We're good together.

26:46.418 --> 26:50.650
Yes. We are.

26:54.660 --> 27:00.394
- But-
- You have issues. It's okay. We all do.

27:00.465 --> 27:03.957
There's just one big one in particular
that I don't think I can love with.

27:06.038 --> 27:11.169
Live with. I need to get out
before I get more involved.

27:13.211 --> 27:15.338
We can still work together,
can't we?

27:15.414 --> 27:18.850
I'd hate to have to ask
for reassignment.

27:18.917 --> 27:20.851
This is really important to me.

27:21.720 --> 27:23.984
We agreed this would
never affect the job.

27:24.056 --> 27:26.547
- We did.
- Good.

27:30.963 --> 27:34.091
You know, there's just one thing
I don't understand.

27:34.166 --> 27:37.226
Just one?

27:37.302 --> 27:39.429
Is the air force the only thing
keeping you two apart?

27:40.906 --> 27:42.999
Rules and regulations?

27:43.075 --> 27:45.009
Because if it is, you're making
a very big mistake.

27:47.212 --> 27:49.146
And you know what I should do?

27:50.415 --> 27:52.576
- Retire.
- Again?

27:52.651 --> 27:55.176
Don't get me wrong. You are considered
invaluable to the program...

27:55.253 --> 27:58.313
by the Pentagon,
but the president has appointed...

27:58.390 --> 28:00.551
a civilian to run the SGC before.

28:05.397 --> 28:07.388
Just a thought.

28:25.550 --> 28:28.280
So it's true?

28:28.353 --> 28:31.049
He tricked me.

28:31.123 --> 28:33.683
How? You couldn't tell?

28:34.693 --> 28:36.957
No.

28:37.029 --> 28:41.966
He must have found some old
Ancient research on ascension.

28:42.034 --> 28:45.697
When he came to Kheb,
he knew what he was doing.

28:45.771 --> 28:48.171
When I realized the horrible mistake
that I had made...

28:48.240 --> 28:51.038
I tried to undo it, but I couldn't.

28:53.111 --> 28:55.511
That's when the Others stepped in.

28:55.580 --> 28:57.514
I don't understand.
They only sent him halfway back.

28:57.582 --> 28:59.675
- Why not all the way?
- It's complicated.

28:59.751 --> 29:01.742
Yeah. What isn't around here?

29:03.522 --> 29:06.047
They warned him.

29:06.124 --> 29:09.093
He wasn't allowed to use
any knowledge or power...

29:09.161 --> 29:13.188
unless he otherwise
would have gained it as a Goa'uld.

29:13.265 --> 29:15.199
I don't understand.

29:15.267 --> 29:17.462
They let him wreak havoc.

29:18.537 --> 29:20.596
They don't care if he destroys
all life in the galaxy...

29:20.672 --> 29:22.833
life they themselves created?

29:22.908 --> 29:25.877
They haven't stopped me
from continuing my work.

29:29.047 --> 29:32.414
I've tried to make up for it,
help when I can.

29:34.419 --> 29:36.410
It's your punishment.

29:38.290 --> 29:41.316
You're forced to watch,
powerless to interfere.

29:41.393 --> 29:44.794
They let Anubis do whatever he wants
just to punish you?

29:44.863 --> 29:46.854
It's wrong.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.793
That's what you said
last time.

29:56.074 --> 29:58.065
Excuse me.

30:00.579 --> 30:03.070
Isn't it enough already?

30:03.148 --> 30:06.948
A whole galaxy of innocent people
enslaved and tortured for generations...

30:07.953 --> 30:11.116
now on the verge of being
destroyed for nothing?

30:13.492 --> 30:15.892
For what?

30:15.961 --> 30:18.862
For one mistake a good person
made trying to do a good thing.

30:20.332 --> 30:22.425
Come on. The least you could do
is listen to me.

30:22.501 --> 30:26.437
That can't be against the grand
highfalutin cosmic rules!

30:28.440 --> 30:31.136
Hey, I'm talking to you!

30:41.286 --> 30:43.311
Well, I know you can hear me.

30:44.723 --> 30:46.816
Hasn't she suffered
enough already?

30:49.594 --> 30:51.960
And certainly enough other people
have suffered to punish her.

30:55.167 --> 30:57.101
Don't you think
you've made your point?

30:57.169 --> 30:59.296
That's the thing, Daniel.
They don't.

30:59.371 --> 31:02.670
I keep breaking the same rule-
helping people ascend.

31:02.741 --> 31:05.676
- That's why you're here.
- What if you stopped?

31:08.313 --> 31:11.043
Wouldn't undo the problem.

31:11.116 --> 31:13.584
That's why I keep doing
what I do.

31:14.986 --> 31:19.082
Anubis can't be killed.
Not by you, not by me.

31:46.284 --> 31:50.414
- You okay?
- Actually, I'm fine.

31:51.856 --> 31:55.314
Good even,
as strange as that sounds.

31:55.393 --> 31:57.384
I thought I lost him
four years ago.

31:58.997 --> 32:02.364
Since then, we've been closer
than we ever were my whole life.

32:05.203 --> 32:07.763
In a way, Selmak gave me
the father I never thought I'd know.

32:12.544 --> 32:13.636
Come here.

32:20.719 --> 32:23.210
Thank you, sir.

32:23.288 --> 32:25.415
For what?

32:25.490 --> 32:27.481
For being here for me.

32:30.795 --> 32:32.285
Always.

32:40.438 --> 32:42.429
I'm ready.

33:10.168 --> 33:13.160
I love you.

33:48.506 --> 33:51.532
- Can I get a coffee?
- Get it yourself.

33:52.610 --> 33:54.601
Don't mind if I do.

33:58.583 --> 34:00.710
Hey, Danny boy, you see the paper?

34:00.785 --> 34:04.050
- No. What's it say?
- The trick worked.

34:04.122 --> 34:07.888
Those stupid Jaffa took half
their ships to hunt down Anubis.

34:07.959 --> 34:11.861
Meanwhile, his army was poised
to attack Dakara.

34:11.930 --> 34:15.696
The remaining rebel Jaffa guarding Dakara
are being slaughtered.

34:15.767 --> 34:20.363
It's only a matter of time before old
Anubis gets his hands on the weapon.

34:22.073 --> 34:24.200
I'm sorry. You sound
almost happy about that.

34:25.176 --> 34:26.837
- Well, who, me?
- Yeah.

34:28.246 --> 34:31.682
What do you have against Oma?
No. I wanna know.

34:32.684 --> 34:35.551
You're not just watching.
You're coming in here to rub it in.

34:37.055 --> 34:39.615
Why are you taking
such pleasure in her punishment?

34:39.691 --> 34:43.559
Me? I don't have anything against Oma.
I think she's great, don't I?

34:46.531 --> 34:49.591
Hell, she's the one
that helped me ascend.

34:53.238 --> 34:55.468
You got it now.

34:58.410 --> 34:59.900
You are Anubis.

35:05.350 --> 35:06.840
Cheers.

35:18.363 --> 35:21.196
I knew from the beginning.

35:21.266 --> 35:23.700
Guess I just thought
when you said yes that...

35:30.275 --> 35:32.835
you were worth the risk.

35:32.911 --> 35:35.072
Don't say I deserve better.

35:37.582 --> 35:41.245
- It can't get much better than you.
- That's not true.

35:43.421 --> 35:46.413
I wish I could believe this
had something to do with your father.

35:46.491 --> 35:49.392
You needed some time
to sort things out.

35:54.265 --> 35:58.258
I guess all I can say is
I hope you get what you want.

36:00.038 --> 36:03.201
- That's it?
- What do you want?

36:05.210 --> 36:07.371
You want me to get down
on my knees and beg?

36:07.445 --> 36:09.936
God, no. Of course not.

36:10.949 --> 36:12.439
I just-

36:15.386 --> 36:17.650
I thought you
would react differently.

36:23.161 --> 36:24.321
Bye, Sam.

36:45.116 --> 36:49.246
The rebel fleet guarding Dakara
has fallen to the forces of Anubis.

36:49.320 --> 36:52.312
Bra'tac and the remaining
rebel ships will not arrive in time.

36:53.625 --> 36:55.559
Anubis now controls the weapon.

36:55.627 --> 36:58.061
Well, then we find
the biggest damn nuke we can...

36:58.129 --> 37:00.222
and we shove it
right through the gate now.

37:00.298 --> 37:02.858
Anubis will certainly
have the gate shielded.

37:02.934 --> 37:05.926
The nuke will not arrive
in one piece.

37:06.004 --> 37:08.996
If we can dial the Alpha Site,
we may be able to prevent the weapon...

37:09.073 --> 37:11.564
from connecting
a wormhole to either planet.

37:11.643 --> 37:14.407
- It may only buy us the 38 minutes that-
- Go. Go. Just go.

37:19.584 --> 37:21.848
Sergeant, dial the Alpha Site now.

37:28.293 --> 37:30.625
Wait a minute.
That's not me.

37:30.695 --> 37:33.425
- What?
- I don't know.

37:36.801 --> 37:38.132
Incoming wormhole.

37:40.838 --> 37:43.636
- That won't stop the weapon's energy.
- If it is the weapon.

37:47.779 --> 37:49.872
- No iris codes.
- We're too late.

37:51.482 --> 37:52.813
Self-destruct.

37:52.884 --> 37:54.818
That's not gonna destroy
the gate and, theoretically...

37:54.886 --> 37:57.116
there's only a remote chance
it would disengage an active incoming-

37:57.188 --> 37:59.383
Carter! Carter.

38:04.462 --> 38:07.454
You make a great cup of coffee.

38:10.368 --> 38:12.928
Well, gotta go.

38:26.150 --> 38:28.209
There's nothing you can do.

38:28.286 --> 38:31.050
You don't have the power.

38:31.122 --> 38:33.352
But I do.

38:44.235 --> 38:46.760
- You can't kill me either.
- I can fight you.

38:46.838 --> 38:49.432
- Well, you can't win.
- It won't matter.

38:49.507 --> 38:51.873
You won't be able to do anything
but fight me back.

38:51.943 --> 38:53.342
What are you gonna do?

38:53.411 --> 38:56.346
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

39:49.834 --> 39:52.064
- Wormhole disengaged.
- What's going on?

39:52.970 --> 39:56.497
I don't know.
Must be some kind of system malfunction.

39:56.574 --> 39:58.201
- That's impossible.
- Shut it off.

40:00.778 --> 40:03.406
Aborting self-destruct.

40:11.389 --> 40:14.984
<i>The Kull warriors became
disorganized and confused...</i>

40:15.059 --> 40:17.391
as though they no longer
knew what to do.

40:17.462 --> 40:20.329
They no longer had
a master to serve.

40:20.398 --> 40:22.195
After that,
they were easily defeated.

40:22.266 --> 40:24.564
Many Jaffa lost
their lives at Dakara.

40:24.635 --> 40:29.595
Those that survived are united
as never before, and we are in agreement.

40:29.674 --> 40:34.611
- The weapon must be destroyed.
- Well, that's good.

40:34.679 --> 40:37.170
I still don't quite understand
what happened.

40:37.248 --> 40:40.775
One minute, Anubis is about to push the
button that ends all life in the galaxy...

40:40.852 --> 40:43.252
and the next minute,
he's just gone.

40:44.188 --> 40:47.419
Indeed.
It is a great mystery.

40:49.160 --> 40:52.061
- You think?
- I do.

40:52.130 --> 40:55.361
It's the only thing that would explain
the self-destruct not going off.

40:56.801 --> 40:58.462
Of what do you speak?

40:58.536 --> 41:01.471
O'Neill believes that Daniel Jackson
is somehow responsible.

41:01.539 --> 41:03.473
Nope, it wasn't me.

41:04.976 --> 41:06.568
Anybody else hear that?

41:08.713 --> 41:10.806
I'm in here!

41:13.384 --> 41:15.375
That's Daniel.

41:17.989 --> 41:22.585
Don't come in!
Hey, there.

41:24.028 --> 41:25.518
Something.

41:41.379 --> 41:44.371
It's a long story.

41:57.628 --> 42:01.064
- This is great.
- I told you.

42:01.132 --> 42:04.295
I can't believe we didn't
do this years ago.

42:04.368 --> 42:08.361
Yes, well, let's not dwell.

42:11.742 --> 42:13.676
There are no fish
in this pond, are there?

42:13.744 --> 42:15.234
Nope.

42:30.328 --> 42:31.818
Nice.
