WEBVTT

00:01.630 --> 00:04.667
Previously on Elementary...
I understand _how
the cartel IS running now.

00:04.700 --> 00:06.736
You forced all of your husband's
key lieutenants out

00:06.770 --> 00:08.328
and replaced them
with women.

00:08.370 --> 00:10.736
I know how crazy
this is making you.

00:10.770 --> 00:14.501
Trying to convince everyone
I'm some sort of mastermind?

00:14.540 --> 00:16.349
You're under arrest.

00:16.380 --> 00:18.268
BELL: You have the right
to remain silent

00:18.310 --> 00:19.618
and refuse _to
answer questions.

00:19.650 --> 00:20.776
Hey, my dad called
this afternoon.

00:20.820 --> 00:23.482
He wants to take
us out to dinner.

00:23.520 --> 00:25.215
I'm sorry it's taken so long
for us to get together.

00:25.250 --> 00:26.285
You're remarkable.

00:27.590 --> 00:29.478
You know, you might have
to accept the fact

00:29.530 --> 00:31.225
that, whatever your relationship
with Andrew means,

00:31.260 --> 00:32.522
you just don't want it.

00:32.560 --> 00:34.699
Then what do I want?

00:34.730 --> 00:36.220
MAN:
Skim-milk late for Joan

00:36.270 --> 00:37.692
and whole-milk
latte for Andrew.

00:37.730 --> 00:39.288
Thank you.

00:39.340 --> 00:41.558
Oh. Excuse me.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.636
(clears throat)
Skim milk.

00:43.670 --> 00:45.501
I think you gave
me the wrong one.
Oh.

00:45.540 --> 00:47.576
Oh, my God.
What's wrong?
(gagging)

00:49.750 --> 00:52.639
Oh, my God.
Somebody call an ambulance!

00:52.680 --> 00:55.410
Andrew. Andrew.
(gagging, gasping)

01:00.860 --> 01:03.055
(door buzzes, opens)

01:05.560 --> 01:07.551
(door closes)

01:19.310 --> 01:21.403
Six days ago,

01:21.440 --> 01:23.249
my boyfriend Andrew Mittal
drank coffee

01:23.280 --> 01:25.669
from a cup with my name on it.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.746
It was laced
with hemlock.

01:27.780 --> 01:31.443
He died before
the ambulance got there.

01:31.490 --> 01:33.549
There was a woman
In the coffee shop

01:33.590 --> 01:35.387
wearing a blue leather jacket.

01:35.420 --> 01:40.153
She bumped into me when I was
picking up our drinks.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.895
Her name is Marion Desjardins.

01:41.930 --> 01:44.490
She's a French immigrant
living in the United States

01:44.530 --> 01:46.589
with a visa
from your old company.

01:46.640 --> 01:50.303
We bring in lots of people
from overseas.

01:50.340 --> 01:52.672
Consultants, mostly.

01:52.710 --> 01:55.406
Ms. Desjardins is an assassin.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.579
After we I.D.'d her,
we got a warrant

01:57.610 --> 02:00.579
to search her apartment
and found the hemlock plants.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.815
She confessed
to dosing my coffee,

02:02.850 --> 02:05.182
but claims it was
a random crime

02:05.220 --> 02:08.155
that had nothing
to do with you.

02:08.190 --> 02:10.351
So, how much are you
paying her for that?

02:10.390 --> 02:13.826
Even if you could get her
to admit that I paid her--

02:13.860 --> 02:17.364
which, by the way, I didn't--

02:17.400 --> 02:20.836
I'm already in this prison
until I die.

02:20.870 --> 02:22.906
Thanks to you.

02:22.940 --> 02:24.498
So...

02:24.540 --> 02:27.338
what are you doing here, Joan?

02:27.380 --> 02:30.304
Andrew was brilliant and kind.

02:30.350 --> 02:33.342
This rivalry
is between you and me.

02:33.380 --> 02:35.871
How can you be so naive?

02:35.920 --> 02:38.480
If he was involved
with you,

02:38.520 --> 02:41.216
he was involved with me.

02:42.260 --> 02:44.626
Take her away.

02:44.660 --> 02:47.754
You say this guy Andrew
was your boyfriend?

02:47.800 --> 02:50.519
The way I heard it, you were
breaking up with him that day.

02:52.270 --> 02:53.737
That must feel terrible.

02:53.770 --> 02:55.761
(door buzzes)

03:00.440 --> 03:02.476
GREGSON: We can't really
do anything with the fact

03:02.510 --> 03:03.943
that Elana March
said she knows

03:03.980 --> 03:05.777
what you and Andrew
were talking about,

03:05.810 --> 03:08.347
because there was a lot
of people In that coffee shop,

03:08.380 --> 03:09.984
and she could have heard that
from anyone.

03:10.020 --> 03:14.252
Now, that being said,
I know the warden over there,

03:14.290 --> 03:17.327
and he did a spot check
on her cell tonight.

03:17.360 --> 03:19.453
He found enough
contraband in there

03:19.500 --> 03:21.957
to put her in isolation
for a week or two.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.695
So she's not
gonna be talking

03:23.730 --> 03:26.267
to any of her friends
for a while.

03:26.300 --> 03:28.598
She's not gonna come
after me again.

03:28.640 --> 03:30.460
Not right away.

03:30.510 --> 03:31.966
She'll wait
till things die down.

03:32.010 --> 03:33.978
But just to be safe,

03:34.010 --> 03:36.308
you should switch up
your travel patterns,

03:36.350 --> 03:38.500
and I'm gonna put a unit
outside of your building.

03:40.750 --> 03:42.945
We'll keep you safe.

03:44.320 --> 03:45.947
Thanks.

03:53.800 --> 03:54.994
Uh, Watson,
I'll continue

03:55.030 --> 03:56.566
to bring food over
to your apartment

03:56.600 --> 03:58.329
if it's not too_much
of an Imposmon.

03:58.370 --> 04:00.736
You have a number of things
on your mind at the moment,

04:00.770 --> 04:03.034
and sustenance
needn't be one of them.

04:03.070 --> 04:05.561
As for our collaboration,
you just let me know

04:05.610 --> 04:07.305
when you're ready
to resume casework,

04:07.340 --> 04:08.830
and I won't intrude
until then.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.973
Thanks. It'll just be
a couple more days.

04:11.010 --> 04:12.045
Mm-hmm.

04:12.080 --> 04:15.379
Um, do you have counsel?

04:15.420 --> 04:16.978
It's been almost a week
since Andrew died.

04:17.020 --> 04:18.681
You've said almost
nothing about it.

04:18.720 --> 04:19.982
Which is your prerogative,
of course.

04:20.020 --> 04:21.578
Ijust... Iwant
to be certain

04:21.620 --> 04:24.418
that you have someone to, uh,
discuss the matter with.

04:24.460 --> 04:27.691
I'd offer my services
if you don't.

04:27.730 --> 04:28.992
(elevator bell clings)

04:29.030 --> 04:30.725
Andrew died because
he knew me.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.591
I don't really know what
else there is to say.

04:37.640 --> 04:40.871
MAN: Mr. Holmes, thank you
for agreeing to see me.

04:40.910 --> 04:44.471
We've actually met
before-- sort of.

04:44.510 --> 04:47.911
I moderate the discussion boards
at BeeCircuit.com.

04:49.750 --> 04:52.310
You're BeeBeeKing17.

04:52.360 --> 04:53.611
I am. (chuckles)

04:53.660 --> 04:54.809
You're a detective.

04:54.860 --> 04:56.009
I know from your posts.

04:56.060 --> 04:57.880
I have a bit
of a problem...

04:57.930 --> 04:59.750
I'm gonna stop you right there,
Mr. Joseph.

04:59.800 --> 05:00.892
I can't help you.

05:00.930 --> 05:02.795
You don't know what I'm asking.

05:02.830 --> 05:04.525
I don't need to.

05:04.570 --> 05:06.891
In the four years
I've frequented your Web site,

05:06.940 --> 05:09.090
I've sent you no fewer
than 13 letters

05:09.140 --> 05:11.631
detailing my proposed solutions
to the phenomenon

05:11.670 --> 05:13.501
known as colony
collapse disorder.

05:13.540 --> 05:16.646
You have sent me
exactly zero replies.

05:16.680 --> 05:18.898
You know how much
correspondence I get?

05:18.950 --> 05:20.076
I've got no idea.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.644
I do know, however,

05:21.680 --> 05:23.944
that mine is backed
by quality thinking.

05:23.990 --> 05:25.787
If you'd bothered
to find that out,

05:25.820 --> 05:27.515
you wouldn't find yourself
without a detective

05:27.560 --> 05:29.357
in your hour of need.

05:32.030 --> 05:34.851
Is there some way that I can
make this up to you?

05:34.900 --> 05:36.993
I suppose, if you were
to publish my theories

05:37.030 --> 05:39.737
on gamma rays
as a potential solution to CCD,

05:39.770 --> 05:41.658
then I might be able
to hear you out.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.406
Gamma rays?

05:43.440 --> 05:45.465
They... they've worked
in a couple instances,

05:45.510 --> 05:47.000
but they... they don't
scale as an answer.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.803
They're too dangerous.
You give John Q. Beekeeper

05:48.840 --> 05:50.740
access to gamma rays,
he'll melt his face off.

05:50.780 --> 05:53.476
A fact I addressed in
my most recent letter.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.669
Fine.

05:54.720 --> 05:57.143
Yeah, I'll put it
on the site.

05:57.190 --> 06:01.012
I also require that you change
your online user name.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.449
The cheap punnery
of "BeeBeeKing17"

06:03.490 --> 06:06.653
is offensive to musicians
and apIarlsts alike.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.094
You'll make the change?

06:14.140 --> 06:16.062
I guess.

06:16.100 --> 06:17.761
Good.

06:17.810 --> 06:20.438
So what seems to be the problem?

06:20.480 --> 06:23.847
How do you feel
about a field trip?

06:26.050 --> 06:28.712
MAN: I'm the assistant curator
of mammals here.

06:28.750 --> 06:30.786
HOLMES:
Your problem concerns zebras.

06:30.820 --> 06:34.711
More specifically,
the complete lack thereof.

06:34.760 --> 06:37.024
You've managed to lose track
of your zebras?

06:37.060 --> 06:39.756
Someone broke in here
and took them last night.

06:39.800 --> 06:41.995
Two females.
They're on loan to us

06:42.030 --> 06:44.169
because we're experts
in equine breeding.

06:44.200 --> 06:46.168
Breeding?

06:46.200 --> 06:49.636
Both the stolen animals
are pregnant.

06:49.670 --> 06:52.161
And they're due
in less than a week.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.542
Detective Bell, you're here.
Excellent.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.548
No, it's not
Detective Bell today.

07:36.590 --> 07:39.582
The department told me I had
too many vacation days built up,

07:39.620 --> 07:40.985
so I had to use them
or lose them.

07:41.020 --> 07:42.556
I'm aware
you're off duty.

07:42.590 --> 07:44.729
In fact, that's exactly
why I asked you here.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.227
I've picked up some
potentially interesting work

07:46.260 --> 07:47.591
involving stolen zebras.

07:47.630 --> 07:49.598
I thought it might be
an opportunity

07:49.630 --> 07:51.791
for you to gain
more exposure to my methods.

07:51.830 --> 07:54.663
You want me to work
a case With you?

07:54.700 --> 07:56.702
An informal setting is a more
fertile learning environment,

07:56.740 --> 07:57.832
don't you think?

07:57.870 --> 07:59.804
Think of it is a favor.

07:59.840 --> 08:02.001
So I'll work for you, and
somehow you're doing me a favor?

08:02.040 --> 08:03.871
Well, I do owe you a debt.
You'll recall

08:03.910 --> 08:05.571
the unfortunate business
with you and the bullet.

08:05.610 --> 08:07.271
I remember when
you got me shot.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.845
Look, I get it-- you want
somebody to talk at,

08:09.890 --> 08:12.108
but you don't want to
bother Joan right now?

08:12.150 --> 08:13.651
I will pay you.

08:13.690 --> 08:14.987
I'm already
getting paid today.

08:15.020 --> 08:16.885
A donation to the charity
of your choice, then.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.921
How'd you know I didn't
have plans for the day?

08:18.960 --> 08:21.155
People who are forced by
their employers to take time off

08:21.200 --> 08:23.998
don't generally have
thriving social lives.

08:24.030 --> 08:26.066
My rate to the
Harlem Youth Club.

08:26.100 --> 08:28.136
You keep track
of the hours.

08:29.170 --> 08:31.001
BELL: _
So you think

08:31.040 --> 08:32.735
someone just led
a couple zebras

08:32.780 --> 08:34.179
out the back door
and drove away?

08:36.610 --> 08:38.043
This loading dock
is the only

08:38.080 --> 08:39.616
relatively private
means of egress.

08:39.650 --> 08:41.777
I examined the _scene
before you arrived,

08:41.820 --> 08:43.947
and there were several fresh
hoofprints in the soil

08:43.990 --> 08:45.617
near one of the doors.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.754
Saw a few security cameras
in the zoo.

08:47.790 --> 08:49.781
Have you seen the footage?
There isn't any.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.582
Not coincidentally, the
power to the cameras

08:51.630 --> 08:53.723
was knocked out shortly
before the robbery.

08:53.760 --> 08:55.296
And that didn't trip
an alarm?

08:55.330 --> 08:57.798
This is a 200--
I don't think burglary

08:57.830 --> 08:59.969
is generally of
paramount concern.

09:00.000 --> 09:02.707
Now, there are two
sets of tire tracks

09:02.740 --> 09:04.105
within the loading dock.

09:04.140 --> 09:06.734
Tread is identical,
but one set of tracks

09:06.780 --> 09:09.169
is approximately one centimeter
deeper than the other.

09:09.210 --> 09:11.041
If you need me
to translate that

09:11.080 --> 09:12.616
into the idiom of_
American exceptionallsm,

09:12.650 --> 09:14.572
a centimeter is about
a third of an inch.

09:14.620 --> 09:15.917
I got it, thanks.

09:15.950 --> 09:18.111
So the first set of tracks
is when they drove up;

09:18.150 --> 09:20.050
the second one's deeper
because they had zebras

09:20.090 --> 09:22.183
in the back
when they drove away.

09:22.220 --> 09:24.927
Well deduced, Detective Bell.
I knew you'd make good company.

09:24.960 --> 09:27.622
Let me ask you something--
what do you think would happen

09:27.660 --> 09:30.060
if you call me by my first name?
You worried I'll take away

09:30.100 --> 09:31.067
your blood pudding or something?

09:31.100 --> 09:33.330
What? No.

09:33.370 --> 09:35.793
Good. 'Cause I don't even know
what blood pudding is.

09:35.840 --> 09:38.638
"Marcus" works just fine.

09:38.670 --> 09:40.206
Huh.

09:40.240 --> 09:42.947
Looks like they scraped
against the gate on the way out.

09:42.980 --> 09:46.143
So we're looking for a purple
truck with two pregnant zebras

09:46.180 --> 09:48.011
in the back.
These guys really know

09:48.050 --> 09:49.642
how to keep
a low profile.

09:49.690 --> 09:53.080
That might be better
camouflage than it seems.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.759
That shade of purple
is a proprietary color

09:55.790 --> 09:59.021
owned by Axiom Parcel
Delivery, or APD.

09:59.060 --> 10:00.925
It's almost impossible
to reproduce

10:00.960 --> 10:02.359
without the
company's consent.

10:02.400 --> 10:04.322
So, if you can't reproduce
the color,

10:04.370 --> 10:06.838
that means the thieves
stole an APD truck.

10:06.870 --> 10:08.337
Or they drive one.
Anyway, we should

10:08.370 --> 10:10.235
find out if
a truck's been stolen.

10:10.270 --> 10:12.329
Then what? I mean, these guys
aren't gonna be dumb enough

10:12.370 --> 10:14.372
to drive around with plates
that have been reported stolen.

10:14.410 --> 10:16.071
License plates
aren't the only way

10:16.110 --> 10:17.702
to find that truck,
Detective Bell.

10:17.750 --> 10:19.206
It's "Marcus."

10:23.020 --> 10:24.647
(door opens)

10:24.690 --> 10:26.817
BELL (calls):
Hello?
In here.

10:26.860 --> 10:27.918
(door closes)

10:29.860 --> 10:33.728
Why is your picture on the
wall at the Indian place?

10:33.760 --> 10:37.389
Oh. I helped the owner's family
resolve a misunderstanding

10:37.430 --> 10:40.194
having to do with caste system,
and they were very grateful.

10:40.240 --> 10:41.730
And now you're weighing
a toaster?

10:41.770 --> 10:43.237
Finally got through

10:43.270 --> 10:44.828
to Axiom Parcel Delivery's
corporate office.

10:44.870 --> 10:46.735
It seems
one of their trucks was stolen

10:46.780 --> 10:48.236
eight days ago in Queens.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.202
Apparently, the driver left
one of the vehicles running

10:50.250 --> 10:52.002
when he went _inside
on a home delivery,

10:52.050 --> 10:55.247
and when he emerged, the truck
and its cargo were gone.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.818
Very likely, that's the truck
used in the zoo robbery.

10:58.850 --> 11:02.729
You say that like it explains
why you're weighing a toaster.

11:02.760 --> 11:04.227
APD were kind enough

11:04.260 --> 11:06.421
to send over the truck's
manifest for that day.

11:06.460 --> 11:08.325
I have listed it here.

11:08.360 --> 11:11.090
For each package,
we know the sender's address,

11:11.130 --> 11:13.963
the recipient's address
and the weight of each parcel.

11:14.000 --> 11:16.366
Using that information,
I'm attempting to identify

11:16.400 --> 11:19.233
the contents of each box.

11:19.270 --> 11:21.477
I'm weighing the probable
objects that I have handy,

11:21.510 --> 11:24.240
and relying on weights listed
online for ones that I do not.

11:24.280 --> 11:25.838
How is this supposed
to help us?

11:27.080 --> 11:29.173
It already has.
Package number 27.

11:29.220 --> 11:34.214
From Pet Junction in Chicago
to Seth Buxton, Bayside--

11:34.260 --> 11:36.251
12 pounds, nine ounces.

11:36.290 --> 11:38.224
The weight of the package
is the sum of the weights

11:38.260 --> 11:40.854
of a water bowl, a package of
canine treats and a tail trail.

11:40.900 --> 11:42.322
What's a tail trail?

11:42.360 --> 11:43.827
It's a pet collar

11:43.870 --> 11:45.326
which features
a GPS tracking chip.

11:45.370 --> 11:47.133
The collar
comes precharged,

11:47.170 --> 11:49.092
which means the tracking chip
is already active,

11:49.140 --> 11:51.461
even before it's opened, so if
we can find the tracking chip,

11:51.510 --> 11:53.330
we might be able
to find the stolen truck.

11:53.380 --> 11:57.202
Or it'll take us to some guy
who bought stolen pet supplies.

11:57.250 --> 12:01.346
Either way, it's a leap
we did not have one hour ago.

12:01.380 --> 12:03.280
How much chili powder's in here?

12:03.320 --> 12:04.810
The restaurant has instructions

12:04.850 --> 12:06.909
to make my orders
as picante as they can.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.416
Did you tell them
you were ordering for two?

12:08.460 --> 12:10.325
No.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.850
I'll go tech assist.

12:11.890 --> 12:14.199
They should have GPS
on the collar soon.

12:14.230 --> 12:17.393
Then I guess
I'll order another lunch.

12:17.430 --> 12:19.933
BELL:
Looks like the guy who stole

12:19.970 --> 12:22.234
the truck just
dumped the boxes here.

12:26.170 --> 12:28.434
So, uh...

12:28.480 --> 12:30.903
how's Joan doing aanay?

12:30.950 --> 12:32.815
I haven't seen her
since the funeral.

12:32.850 --> 12:34.147
I don't know.

12:34.180 --> 12:35.977
All I know is,
she's not doing well,

12:36.020 --> 12:37.942
but other than that,
she's not confided in me.

12:37.990 --> 12:39.287
So when you two aren't

12:39.320 --> 12:41.379
working a case, what happens?

12:41.420 --> 12:43.786
You just sit around
in contemplative silence?

12:43.830 --> 12:45.525
I'm not opposed
to a productive silence,

12:45.560 --> 12:47.926
but in this case,
I have offered to listen.

12:47.960 --> 12:51.259
My first partner was involved
in a shooting

12:51.300 --> 12:53.791
eight weeks into the job.

12:53.840 --> 12:57.105
I let him walk around with PTSD
for the next six months.

12:57.140 --> 12:59.108
I offered to help, too,

12:59.140 --> 13:01.938
but we didn't get anywhere
until I insisted.

13:04.910 --> 13:06.172
You find something?

13:06.210 --> 13:07.518
I don't know.

13:07.550 --> 13:09.142
It's a receipt.

13:09.180 --> 13:10.989
Or at least, it was.

13:11.020 --> 13:12.510
(sniffles)

13:12.550 --> 13:14.415
(panﬁng)

13:14.460 --> 13:18.282
Modern receipts are printed
often with thermal ink.

13:18.330 --> 13:20.525
It helps the text
appear sharp and clean.

13:20.560 --> 13:22.289
Trouble is, it fades

13:22.330 --> 13:23.592
rather quickly.

13:23.630 --> 13:25.166
Unless you heat it.

13:25.200 --> 13:26.929
Precisely.

13:29.940 --> 13:32.568
"855 North Sullivan
Street, Brooklyn."

13:32.610 --> 13:34.999
It is, apparently, the
address of "Criterion

13:35.040 --> 13:37.201
Equine Veterinary Services."

13:37.250 --> 13:38.478
A horse hospital.

13:38.510 --> 13:41.149
This may not be here
by coincidence.

13:41.180 --> 13:42.442
Someone here might
have something

13:42.480 --> 13:45.483
to do with our
stolen zebras.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.022
I'm sorry I should come over
without announcing myself.

13:51.060 --> 13:52.925
I was cleaning out
Andrew's apartment.

13:52.960 --> 13:54.450
Those items

13:54.500 --> 13:56.195
belong to you, I assume?

13:56.230 --> 13:58.460
Thank you.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.468
Um, would you like to, uh...

14:00.500 --> 14:02.058
I really need to be going.

14:02.100 --> 14:03.328
Uh, Mr. Mittal,

14:03.370 --> 14:06.464
I am so sorry.

14:06.510 --> 14:09.877
I know that I said that
to you at the serVIce already,

14:09.910 --> 14:11.502
but I wanted to say it again.

14:11.550 --> 14:15.008
I... I can't help but feel
responsible

14:15.050 --> 14:17.382
for what happened to Andrew.

14:19.090 --> 14:20.887
My wife says you believe

14:20.920 --> 14:24.026
a woman_ named Elana March
kIlled my son?

14:26.360 --> 14:29.966
Did Andrew_kn_ow
you put her In jaII?

14:30.000 --> 14:32.025
We talked about it.

14:33.470 --> 14:36.064
Do you think he realized
you might become a target?

14:36.100 --> 14:38.534
Um...

14:38.570 --> 14:40.674
to be honest,
we hadn't really talked

14:40.710 --> 14:43.645
about Elana March in a while.

14:43.680 --> 14:46.911
I don't hold you responsible
for Andrew's death.

14:46.950 --> 14:49.271
You didn't poison him.

14:49.320 --> 14:51.982
But given everything
I've learned about this woman,

14:52.020 --> 14:55.649
it's not unreasonable to think
she'd take measures agaInst you.

14:55.690 --> 14:57.954
You have guards.

14:57.990 --> 15:01.221
You've taken
every precautIon now.

15:02.730 --> 15:05.290
I wish you'd done more before.

15:07.440 --> 15:10.967
(door opens, closes)

15:11.010 --> 15:14.002
BELL: So we made it
to Criterion Equine.

15:14.040 --> 15:16.474
What do we do,
go in there

15:16.510 --> 15:18.273
and listen for hoofbeats?

15:18.310 --> 15:20.210
I'm confident something
will present itself

15:20.250 --> 15:21.649
once we're inside.

15:24.190 --> 15:26.909
Something like the purple truck
we've been looking for?

15:30.690 --> 15:32.681
*

16:02.360 --> 16:04.419
(quiet hoofbeats)

16:18.270 --> 16:20.977
BELL:
Huh.

16:24.380 --> 16:26.678
Why go through the trouble

16:26.710 --> 16:29.144
of stealing two zebras if
you're just gonna dump them

16:29.180 --> 16:31.512
in a warehouse
12 hours later?

16:35.260 --> 16:37.558
Technically...

16:37.590 --> 16:40.127
there should be
four zebras here.

16:40.160 --> 16:43.129
Both of these mares
are pregnant, remember?

16:48.170 --> 16:50.229
(sighs)

16:50.270 --> 16:52.261
(panﬁng)

16:52.310 --> 16:54.631
Although,
this is Oxytocin.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.774
It's mammalian
neurohypophySIal hormone,

16:57.810 --> 17:00.119
which is used
toinducelabor

17:00.150 --> 17:03.517
in equine species.

17:06.650 --> 17:10.689
Both of these animals have given
birth since their kidnapping.

17:10.730 --> 17:13.597
So the thief wanted the babies,
but not the mothers?

17:13.630 --> 17:15.495
Why?

17:24.810 --> 17:26.539
Well...

17:46.190 --> 17:48.522
Well, we were right
about one thing.

17:48.560 --> 17:51.097
_ Someone from _
CrIterIon Equme SerVIces

17:51.130 --> 17:52.768
is involved in this crime.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.344
David Chang was a vet
at Criterion Equine.

18:06.380 --> 18:08.712
Looks like he didn't die
from the first bullet.

18:08.750 --> 18:10.638
We found some DNA
under his fingernails

18:10.690 --> 18:12.487
that must have come
from the killer.

18:12.520 --> 18:14.385
Chang tried to fight
after he got shot.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.183
HOLMES: What about
our strIpey frIends?

18:16.220 --> 18:18.757
Well, both zebras are
on their way back to the zoo.

18:18.790 --> 18:20.428
They should arrive
within the hour.

18:20.460 --> 18:22.519
CSU's still got
some things to finish up,

18:22.560 --> 18:24.562
but here's what
I got so far.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.864
David Chang and a partner
steal an APD truck

18:26.900 --> 18:28.697
in Queens last week,
which they use

18:28.740 --> 18:31.163
to transport
two stolen zebras last night.

18:31.210 --> 18:33.599
Dr. Chang oversees the birth
of the zebra foals

18:33.640 --> 18:35.676
in this warehouse
early thIs mornIng,

18:35.710 --> 18:37.541
after which
his partner shoots him

18:37.580 --> 18:39.741
and flees the scene
with both newborns.

18:40.780 --> 18:42.418
Wrong.

18:42.450 --> 18:44.441
All right, what am I missing?

18:44.490 --> 18:47.288
All the parts
that matter.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.187
A man who is not David Chang
steals an APD truck.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.585
Said truck is then used
to abduct two zebras.

18:52.630 --> 18:55.724
Knowing that induced equine
births can be quite troublesome,

18:55.760 --> 18:58.194
the zebra thief drives his truck
to this warehouse,

18:58.230 --> 19:00.596
a mere 100 meters _from
a renowned horse Ianrmary

19:00.640 --> 19:02.596
with a_re_nown_ed
horse IanrmarIst.

19:02.640 --> 19:04.801
The delivery of the foals does
indeed become troublesome.

19:04.840 --> 19:07.638
At which point, the zebra thief
forcibly enlists the help

19:07.680 --> 19:09.500
of Dr. David Chang.

19:09.540 --> 19:10.939
The good doctor
delivers the foals,

19:10.980 --> 19:12.845
and is then shot
to keep him quiet.

19:12.880 --> 19:15.713
I assume you got some evidence
that supports that theory?

19:15.750 --> 19:17.741
I had a look
through David Chang's phone

19:17.790 --> 19:19.314
before it was carted off.

19:19.350 --> 19:21.181
There are a myriad of texts
from his wife

19:21.220 --> 19:22.585
wondering why he is late

19:22.620 --> 19:24.724
for a flight to Chicago
an hour ago. David Chang

19:24.760 --> 19:27.399
is an innocent victim,
not a willing confederate.

19:27.430 --> 19:29.591
I still don't understand
why the shooter would just

19:29.630 --> 19:31.461
leave the truck here
for us to find.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.866
Well, you can't drive a truck
with a broken rear axle.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.868
Come again?
_The rear axle of
thIs truck Is fractured.

19:35.900 --> 19:38.505
Probably occurred when
the zebra thief tried

19:38.540 --> 19:40.804
to unload 1,500 pounds
worth of zebra

19:40.840 --> 19:42.478
without any kind of ramp.

19:42.510 --> 19:44.239
This is an
unfamIIIar space.

19:44.280 --> 19:47.738
The animals would have
been quite panicked.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.611
So, after the births
in the warehouse,

19:49.650 --> 19:52.289
the perp tries to drive away,
but the truck won't move,

19:52.320 --> 19:53.719
so he takes the zebra foals

19:53.760 --> 19:55.785
and flees the scene
in a different vehicle?

19:55.820 --> 19:57.856
Probably an SUV,
judging by the amount

19:57.890 --> 20:00.427
of broken glass on
the street behind you.

20:02.730 --> 20:04.527
I'll put out
a "find this" message

20:04.570 --> 20:06.458
for an SUV
with a broken window.

20:06.500 --> 20:09.663
You and I, meanwhile, will make
some calls to upstate New York.

20:09.700 --> 20:12.407
"Federals Feeds,
Thiells, New York."

20:12.440 --> 20:14.237
Yeah. Ithink it's
the feed dispensary

20:14.280 --> 20:16.236
where our thief
purchased all his hay.

20:16.280 --> 20:17.975
Well, where'd you find this?

20:18.010 --> 20:20.672
'Cause CSU was already in there,
and they didn't find anything.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.211
Well, they failed to examine
the zebra droppings.

20:25.720 --> 20:28.780
Lasagna is best eaten after
a short cooling off period.

20:28.820 --> 20:30.856
This should be
at optimal temperature shortly.

20:30.890 --> 20:32.482
(sighs)

20:32.530 --> 20:36.489
This is completely
unnecessary, but... thanks.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.900
If you're gonna
stay, you can work.

20:49.940 --> 20:51.703
I know you want to.
Mm.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.979
You know, I-I pulled away
from you last year

21:03.020 --> 21:04.988
because, um,

21:05.030 --> 21:09.490
I felt myself getting sucked
into this world that you built.

21:14.340 --> 21:16.865
I wanted something normal.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.936
Something that was mine.

21:18.970 --> 21:21.734
Well, there's nothing
wrong with that.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.941
You have a right
to your own space.

21:23.980 --> 21:26.346
Both physically and mentally.

21:28.380 --> 21:31.349
I'm not sure that I do.

21:31.390 --> 21:33.858
I don't think I can
keep our work

21:33.890 --> 21:36.882
and my private life separate.

21:36.920 --> 21:39.718
Just doesn't seem possible.

21:39.760 --> 21:41.625
Well, you already know that.

21:41.660 --> 21:44.094
I mean, it's part of the reason
you live the way that you do.

21:44.130 --> 21:48.032
Yes, but my choices do not
have to be your choices, Watson.

21:48.070 --> 21:51.301
I might be better off
if they were.

21:55.380 --> 21:58.747
Andrew would have been
better off.

22:04.950 --> 22:06.815
Wow, I really enjoyed that.

22:06.850 --> 22:09.512
I'm so sorry. I didn't intend
to spend the night here.

22:09.560 --> 22:10.857
I got caught up in my work.

22:10.890 --> 22:13.393
So what's up with the maps?

22:13.430 --> 22:14.590
Detective Bell and I
are In purSUIt

22:14.630 --> 22:15.927
of a pair of
infant zebras.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.461
The man who stole them

22:17.500 --> 22:19.422
is also very
likely a murderer.

22:19.470 --> 22:21.791
And last night, we determined
that he bought zebra food

22:21.840 --> 22:24.559
and other supplies from a store
called Federal Feeds.

22:24.610 --> 22:26.931
We spoke to the store
manager, and he confirmed

22:26.970 --> 22:28.528
that he sold
suppIIes to a man

22:28.580 --> 22:31.105
driving an APD delivery
truck last Thursday.

22:31.150 --> 22:32.708
Great, so you have
a description.

22:32.750 --> 22:33.876
Yes and no.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.547
The only details
to emerge was that

22:35.580 --> 22:37.480
he was six foot tall
and CaucaSIan.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.010
The manager did recall
that the man had been

22:39.050 --> 22:41.018
complaining about a hailstorm
the night before.

22:41.060 --> 22:42.687
And you're looking at

22:42.720 --> 22:44.426
Rockland County
weather maps from--

22:44.460 --> 22:46.121
when did you say the guy
bought supplies? Thursday?

22:46.160 --> 22:48.697
Okay, so these maps
are from Wednesday night.

22:48.730 --> 22:50.766
Figure out where it hailed
in Rockland County,

22:50.800 --> 22:52.825
and then see
if you can find a place

22:52.870 --> 22:54.895
where you could keep
a couple of baby zebras.

22:54.940 --> 22:56.828
That was my approach.
We've already had the police

22:56.870 --> 22:58.963
in Rockland County search
every stable, barn and farmhouse

22:59.010 --> 23:00.932
within the areas
of falling hail.

23:02.810 --> 23:04.698
Huh.
What?

23:04.750 --> 23:07.048
I read about a psychiatric
hospital in Rockland County

23:07.080 --> 23:08.411
named Letchworth Village.

23:08.450 --> 23:09.917
It's been closed
for a thIe now,

23:09.950 --> 23:11.838
but it was_ well-known
because the Inmates kept up

23:11.890 --> 23:13.414
a working farm.

23:13.460 --> 23:14.950
They grew crops,
they raised chickens and cows.

23:14.990 --> 23:16.617
I'm sure it must have
had stables.

23:16.660 --> 23:17.888
They haven't torn it down?

23:17.930 --> 23:20.819
No.

23:20.860 --> 23:22.828
It's right there.

23:24.930 --> 23:28.093
It's quiet, lots of space,
far away from people.

23:28.140 --> 23:30.802
It's not a bad place
to raise stolen zebra foals,

23:30.840 --> 23:33.809
_ even if it is _
straIght out of a scary mOV|e.

23:33.840 --> 23:36.035
No doubt this facility's seen
its fair share of horrors.

23:36.080 --> 23:38.173
There was also some
good work done here.

23:38.210 --> 23:40.440
Did you know Letchworth
Village was where doctors

23:40.480 --> 23:42.038
administered the very
first polio vaccin...

23:42.080 --> 23:45.140
Polio vaccination?
Yeah, I knew that.

23:45.190 --> 23:48.956
Look, I Googled the name on
the way over here, same as you.

23:48.990 --> 23:51.652
OFFICER: We found something.
North end of building three.

23:51.690 --> 23:53.021
We're on our way.

23:55.200 --> 23:57.191
It's right over here.

24:00.670 --> 24:02.638
BELL:
We're looking for two.

24:02.670 --> 24:04.535
Any sign of the other one?

24:04.570 --> 24:06.731
Nothing yet.

24:06.770 --> 24:10.604
Well, I guess one baby zebra's
better than none.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.641
You're not wrong...

24:14.950 --> 24:17.885
...but unless I'm mistaken,
that's not a zebra.

24:17.920 --> 24:19.547
What?

24:34.740 --> 24:36.696
This animal's not a zebra.

24:36.740 --> 24:38.503
It's a quagga.

24:38.540 --> 24:41.509
It's an equine species
native to South Africa.

24:41.540 --> 24:43.076
Never heard of them.

24:43.110 --> 24:44.839
Well, that's hardly
surprising.

24:44.880 --> 24:48.816
Been well over 100 years
since anyone's seen a quagga.

24:51.890 --> 24:55.986
Species has been extinct
since 1883.

25:05.100 --> 25:07.568
JOSEPH: Zebras gave birth
to extinct animals?

25:07.600 --> 25:09.534
Looks like the guy
was out on an errand

25:09.570 --> 25:11.834
with the second foal
when we searched the place.

25:11.870 --> 25:15.237
Showing his new merchandise
to a potential buyer, perhaps.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.874
I... I don't care
if you found one quagga,

25:17.910 --> 25:20.708
two quagga...
I care that you found any.

25:20.750 --> 25:22.149
They're extinct.

25:22.180 --> 25:24.785
Actually, it seems that
they're now de-extinct.

25:24.820 --> 25:28.017
As I'm sure you're aware,
scientists have recently

25:28.060 --> 25:32.258
pioneered biotechnology capable
of resurrecting extinct species.

25:32.290 --> 25:34.758
Essentially, the DNA
of the extinct creature is

25:34.800 --> 25:37.769
placed inside the uterus of its
nearing living genetic relative.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.825
In the quagga's case,
that's a zebra.

25:39.870 --> 25:42.998
One pregnancy later,
a formerly extinct species

25:43.040 --> 25:44.803
is birthed into being.

25:46.340 --> 25:49.969
De-extinction is a painstaking
process, Dr. Joseph.

25:50.010 --> 25:52.274
The pregnant animal requires
great care and attention

25:52.310 --> 25:54.119
throughout its gestation period,

25:54.150 --> 25:56.618
which in the case of the zebras,
would be 13 months.

25:56.650 --> 25:59.210
Someone's been giving our zebras
secret checkups?

25:59.250 --> 26:01.810
No one has access

26:01.860 --> 26:03.725
to these animals
except zoo employees.

26:05.260 --> 26:06.955
17 months ago, a pair
of female zebras

26:06.990 --> 26:08.890
arrived at the Bronx Zoo.

26:08.930 --> 26:10.761
Three months later,
it was announced

26:10.800 --> 26:12.688
that both animals were pregnant.

26:12.730 --> 26:16.097
Unbeknownst to anyone except
our mysterious de-extinctionist,

26:16.140 --> 26:19.632
the animals were not pregnant
with zebras but with quaggas.

26:19.670 --> 26:21.103
BELL: Now, for the
next 56 weeks,

26:21.140 --> 26:22.698
they enjoy first-rate care

26:22.740 --> 26:24.674
and accommodation
at your faCIIIty,

26:24.710 --> 26:27.076
_ then when their due da_te'_s
fInally drawn near, the crImInal

26:27.110 --> 26:29.840
drives them away in a truck
to give birth in secret.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.246
Why, though? If you're
gonna reintroduce a species,

26:32.290 --> 26:34.258
wouldn't you want
to be honored for it?

26:34.290 --> 26:36.679
Honored. Or paid.

26:36.720 --> 26:38.221
Not necessarily in that order.

26:38.260 --> 26:40.854
The illegal market for
rare and endangered animals

26:40.900 --> 26:42.720
is quite robust.

26:42.760 --> 26:45.797
The introduction
of an extinct creature

26:45.830 --> 26:48.936
could create quite a frenzy
in certain shadovw places.

26:48.970 --> 26:51.131
Dr. Joseph, we're assuming
you have an alibi

26:51.170 --> 26:53.001
for last night and this morning?

26:53.040 --> 26:55.008
I was with my wife and kids
last night.

26:55.040 --> 26:57.747
We had friends over for dinner,
I dropped my daughter off

26:57.780 --> 26:59.145
at school this morning.

26:59.180 --> 27:01.148
Excellent. Now that we've
cleared that up,

27:01.180 --> 27:03.717
we need your help.

27:05.450 --> 27:07.042
JOSEPH:
Good afternoon.

27:07.090 --> 27:09.888
Those of you who came in
on your day off, thanks.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.956
As the group that
looks after the zebras

27:11.990 --> 27:14.151
here at the zoo, I wanted
to give you the chance to meet

27:14.200 --> 27:15.929
the men responsible
for bringing our ladies home.

27:15.960 --> 27:17.894
Detective Marcus Bell

27:17.930 --> 27:20.865
and NYPD consultant
Sherlock Holmes.

27:22.700 --> 27:25.168
Uh, we appreciate the
welcome, but unfortunately,

27:25.210 --> 27:26.939
one of you is being
quite hypocritical.

27:28.810 --> 27:30.437
The man who stole
your zebras,

27:30.480 --> 27:32.778
who is most likely the same man

27:32.810 --> 27:36.314
who murdered a veterinarian
named David Chang,

27:36.350 --> 27:39.683
is amongst us
at this very moment.

27:44.830 --> 27:46.923
His name is Donovan Gaines.

27:46.960 --> 27:49.724
What? No, no, I...

27:49.760 --> 27:51.261
Save your protests
for the trial.

27:51.300 --> 27:53.791
You, Donovan, are the man
who stole a truck

27:53.840 --> 27:56.331
from Axiom Parcel Delivery
last week.

27:56.370 --> 27:58.861
You are the man who used
that truck to steal two zebras

27:58.910 --> 28:00.263
from this facility.

28:00.310 --> 28:02.335
And when their delivery
did not go as you had hoped,

28:02.380 --> 28:04.905
you're very likely
the man who murdered

28:04.950 --> 28:06.872
Dr. David Chang in cold blood.

28:06.910 --> 28:08.070
No, no, you're crazy.
I didn't have...

28:08.120 --> 28:09.348
Detective Bell,
could I speak to you

28:09.380 --> 28:10.938
over here for a _moment?
Would you just...

28:10.990 --> 28:12.844
One second.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.317
What are you doing? You didn't
tell me you had a suspect.

28:17.360 --> 28:20.022
I don't. Or I didn't when
I started talking. I do now.

28:20.060 --> 28:22.051
You'll recall
the manager at Federal Feeds

28:22.100 --> 28:24.159
described our perpetrator
as a white man.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.497
Course I remember.
That's why I was surprised

28:25.530 --> 28:27.498
when you tore
into that guy.

28:27.530 --> 28:29.088
I've accused Donovan Gaines
because I'm qUIte certaIn

28:29.140 --> 28:31.131
he did not commit the crimes;
I wanted to observe

28:31.170 --> 28:32.865
the behaviors of
the other people in the room.

28:32.910 --> 28:35.208
Now, the more
I've accused Donovan Gaines,

28:35.240 --> 28:37.037
the more a man named
Ben Reynolds has relaxed.

28:37.080 --> 28:39.344
His breathing has slowed, his
blood pressure has dropped,

28:39.380 --> 28:41.814
and his hands have
unclenched; he is relieved.

28:41.850 --> 28:43.784
Uh, i-is everything okay?

28:43.820 --> 28:45.139
Everybody's kind of
waiting to see

28:45.190 --> 28:47.078
if you guys plan
to come back over...

28:47.120 --> 28:49.315
Actually, we only have business
with one of your employees:

28:49.360 --> 28:50.918
Ben Reynolds.

28:50.960 --> 28:54.191
And we'd prefer
to speak to him at the station.

28:59.170 --> 29:00.831
Finally.

29:00.870 --> 29:03.361
I'm gonna say one thing
and then I want my lawyer.

29:03.400 --> 29:07.006
I did not steal two zebras.

29:07.040 --> 29:08.302
Why would anybody even do that?

29:08.340 --> 29:10.399
Oh, well, in this case,
to use their wombs

29:10.440 --> 29:13.147
to reintroduce the quagga
species to the world.

29:13.180 --> 29:16.013
Are you not using your
job at the zoo to finance

29:18.020 --> 29:19.544
Yeah. So?

29:19.590 --> 29:21.319
So you have
the technical expertise

29:21.360 --> 29:23.180
to attempt de-extinction,
you have access to the zebras,

29:23.220 --> 29:25.029
you also have
quite a bit of debt.

29:25.060 --> 29:27.324
You fit the profile
of our criminal rather exactly.

29:29.060 --> 29:31.267
Mr. Reynolds,
we're gonna cut to the chase.

29:31.300 --> 29:33.188
The man who killed
David Chang

29:33.230 --> 29:35.266
left DNA behind at the scene.

29:35.300 --> 29:37.939
So if it wasn't you,
just provide us with a sample,

29:37.970 --> 29:39.301
you'll be on your way.

29:39.340 --> 29:40.932
Why should I help you?

29:40.980 --> 29:42.436
If you choose not to cooperate,

29:42.480 --> 29:44.038
we'll just monitor
your whereabouts

29:44.080 --> 29:45.479
until we can force you to.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.139
Lawyer.

29:50.180 --> 29:51.943
Now.

29:54.060 --> 29:57.211
I'll put a team on him
till we get the paperwork.

29:57.260 --> 29:59.455
If we're lucky, we won't
even need a court order.

29:59.490 --> 30:01.196
He's not gonna
give us a DNA sample,

30:01.230 --> 30:03.926
but perhaps he's got one
floating about in the wild.

30:05.330 --> 30:07.366
(knocking)

30:12.410 --> 30:14.401
(sighs) You really are
on your best behavior.

30:16.340 --> 30:19.047
Must have killed you
not to just pick the lock.

30:19.080 --> 30:20.945
Nonsense. I had several more
seconds worth of waItIng In me.

30:20.980 --> 30:21.947
Your mail.

30:21.980 --> 30:23.379
I did pick that lock.

30:23.420 --> 30:26.912
Although I did not steam open
any of the correspondence.

30:26.950 --> 30:28.315
Been shopping.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.055
Yeah, you've been great
the past few days,

30:30.090 --> 30:31.626
but, you know, it's time
to get off the couch.

30:31.660 --> 30:34.094
Well, you'll be pleased
to know that your nudge

30:34.130 --> 30:36.451
towards Letchworth Village
paid off.

30:36.500 --> 30:38.593
This afternoon,
Detective Bell and I identified

30:38.630 --> 30:40.598
the zebra-stealing murderer
as a zoo employee

30:40.630 --> 30:41.858
named Ben Reynolds.

30:41.900 --> 30:43.197
He refused to give us

30:43.240 --> 30:45.458
a DNA sample,
so I placed a call to my contact

30:45.510 --> 30:47.364
at the zoo, who happily
dug through the trash

30:47.410 --> 30:49.275
and found a can
of the grape soda

30:49.310 --> 30:51.346
preferred by Mr. Reynolds.

30:51.380 --> 30:54.076
And preliminary DNA test results
indicate a match.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.644
Bell and his merry men

30:55.680 --> 30:58.148
are on their way
to make an arrest as we speak.

30:59.150 --> 31:00.378
What is it?

31:00.420 --> 31:02.251
Look at the return zip code.

31:02.290 --> 31:04.155
It's the same place as
the prison they're keeping

31:04.190 --> 31:06.226
Elana March.
I doubt that's her handwriting.

31:06.260 --> 31:09.195
She'd have found someone
to send it on her behalf.

31:09.230 --> 31:11.994
We can call captain and tell him
there's been a threat.

31:12.030 --> 31:14.134
(phone ringing)

31:14.170 --> 31:16.934
Detective Bell.
Mr. Reynolds in custody?

31:16.970 --> 31:18.562
BELL:
Ben Reynolds is in the wind.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.498
Well, how's that possible?
You had men watching him.

31:20.540 --> 31:22.531
You should get over here.

31:24.010 --> 31:26.274
Go. I'll call Gregson.
This is just

31:26.310 --> 31:27.971
Elana trying to get
inside my head.

31:34.520 --> 31:36.010
Reynolds came home at 4:30.

31:36.060 --> 31:38.221
We had a unit on the
front and back door.

31:38.260 --> 31:41.297
He never left. Now, we show
up to arrest him at 6:30,

31:41.330 --> 31:44.959
and the place is empty.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.218
I take it you've searched
the other apartments

31:47.270 --> 31:49.431
in the building?
He's nowhere.

31:49.470 --> 31:52.564
It's like the guy
vanished into thin air.

32:12.260 --> 32:13.227
You know the slang

32:13.260 --> 32:15.421
"to eighty-six," meaning
to get rid of something,

32:15.460 --> 32:18.725
originated in a New York
speakeasy called Chumley's?

32:18.770 --> 32:20.169
No.

32:20.200 --> 32:22.088
You see,
the rear entrance of the bar

32:25.270 --> 32:28.501
Now, when the manager got word
that a raid was on its way,

32:28.540 --> 32:30.303
he would eighty-six his patrons.

32:30.340 --> 32:32.103
He would rush them
out of the back door,

32:32.150 --> 32:33.503
the 86 Bedford Street door,

32:33.550 --> 32:36.439
while he greeted police
at the front.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.641
I assume you're going somewhere
with this.

32:38.690 --> 32:41.488
Well, as it happens,
we're standing across the street

32:41.520 --> 32:45.320
from the building
that used to house Chumley's.

32:45.360 --> 32:49.251
Now, police of the era
could never determine exactly...

32:49.300 --> 32:50.995
how Chumley's

32:51.030 --> 32:54.431
was bringing bootleg liquor
into the building.

32:55.640 --> 32:58.507
Turns out, there was
a network of tunnels

32:58.540 --> 33:02.408
leading from the speakeasy
to the adjacent buildings...

33:02.440 --> 33:04.044
(floor creaking)

33:04.080 --> 33:06.173
...buildings the police
weren't watching.

33:08.050 --> 33:11.087
Care to have a guess what's
underneath these floorboards?

33:13.790 --> 33:15.985
(hinges creak)

33:20.590 --> 33:24.321
Ben Reynolds didn't
vanish into thin air.

33:24.370 --> 33:27.191
_He vanished
Into a tunnel.

33:33.470 --> 33:36.598
Ben Reynolds is wanted
for the murder of David Chang.

33:36.640 --> 33:40.440
The case against him is strong,
so he has no choice but to flee.

33:40.480 --> 33:42.448
He's an indebted
graduate student

33:42.480 --> 33:44.710
with very few
material assets.

33:44.750 --> 33:47.082
If he wants to finance
his life on the run,

33:47.120 --> 33:50.578
he has precisely one chip
which he can and must cash in:

33:50.620 --> 33:53.327
an infant quagga.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.225
These are the facts.

33:55.260 --> 33:57.057
Questions?

33:57.100 --> 33:58.362
Yes.

33:58.400 --> 33:59.719
What am I doing here?

33:59.770 --> 34:02.591
I mean, we had a
work day. It ended.

34:02.640 --> 34:06.098
The normal thing is to go our
separate ways for a few hours.

34:08.110 --> 34:09.577
The fire of deduction
cannot be kindled

34:09.610 --> 34:12.147
without the frisson
of person-to-person contact.

34:12.180 --> 34:13.499
If you want
to work together,

34:13.550 --> 34:15.347
you need to get used
to working odd hours.

34:15.380 --> 34:17.678
Hey. I've been working this case
as a cop

34:17.720 --> 34:19.381
ever since
we found Chang's corpse.

34:19.420 --> 34:20.409
Regardless.

34:20.450 --> 34:22.213
The lines are blurred.

34:22.260 --> 34:24.148
You are committed to seeing
this through via my methods.

34:25.660 --> 34:27.628
We have no idea

34:27.660 --> 34:29.218
where Reynolds is;
a search of his apartment

34:29.260 --> 34:31.569
has yielded no clues
as to where he is keeping

34:31.600 --> 34:34.091
his one remaining quagga.

34:34.140 --> 34:36.461
He does, however,
have to sell the beast.

34:36.500 --> 34:38.468
Our best chance
of a quick apprehension

34:38.510 --> 34:40.535
is to pose as buyers
and then arrest him

34:40.570 --> 34:41.537
at the point of transaction.

34:41.580 --> 34:43.104
How do we do that?

34:43.140 --> 34:44.607
This guy knows
we're looking for him.

34:44.650 --> 34:46.345
He's not gonna put out
a want ad.

34:46.380 --> 34:48.678
No, but he will want to create
a vigorous marketplace

34:48.720 --> 34:50.347
for the animal.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.211
There is, at this moment,

34:52.250 --> 34:54.218
a bidding war
happening somewhere.

34:54.260 --> 34:57.752
All we need to do is find it
and win it.

34:57.790 --> 34:59.382
What's this?

34:59.430 --> 35:01.250
This is everything I could find
on criminal cases

35:01.300 --> 35:03.495
involving the sale
of endangered animals.

35:03.530 --> 35:06.124
There's a global marketplace
for these unfortunate creatures.

35:06.170 --> 35:08.138
It's clandestine,
but there must be a way

35:08.170 --> 35:09.831
to connect the buyers
with the sellers.

35:09.870 --> 35:12.703
So you think there's, what, some
kind of code these guys use?

35:12.740 --> 35:14.708
You know, there are people
who work this stuff full-time.

35:14.740 --> 35:16.378
Don't you think
they would have found it by now?

35:16.410 --> 35:19.573
People, Detective Bell,
are not you and me.

35:26.420 --> 35:28.479
(alarm clock ringing)

35:33.190 --> 35:35.192
(ringing stops)

35:43.340 --> 35:46.559
You want to tell me why we're
having breakfast in Greenpoint?

35:46.610 --> 35:48.669
You made it.
Excellent.

35:48.710 --> 35:51.577
Took the liberty
of ordering for you.

35:51.610 --> 35:54.340
Ah. I don't eat red meat.

35:54.380 --> 35:56.416
A man of hidden depths.

35:56.450 --> 35:58.418
We're here
because this cafe

35:58.450 --> 36:01.351
affords us the
best vantage pomt.

36:01.390 --> 36:03.585
Shortly after you fell
asleep last night,

36:03.620 --> 36:05.520
I realized there
was a common factor

36:05.560 --> 36:07.858
_ in several recent
Illegal anImal trades.

36:07.890 --> 36:11.860
In each case, the transaction
was arranged via a classified ad

36:11.900 --> 36:14.562
placed on a Web site that
deals in animal trading.

36:14.600 --> 36:17.694
Most of the buying and selling
on there, perfectly legitimate,

36:17.740 --> 36:20.368
but every once in
a while, there's an ad

36:20.410 --> 36:23.379
which features the phrase
"once in a blue moon."

36:23.410 --> 36:25.503
Is that one
of our unmarked vans?

36:25.550 --> 36:30.374
"Once in a blue moon" functions
as a dog thstle In those ads.

36:30.420 --> 36:33.241
It's used to signal that
endangered or outlawed animals

36:33.290 --> 36:34.780
are for sale.

36:34.820 --> 36:37.516
And you found an ad last night
using that phrase?

36:37.560 --> 36:39.448
Five, actually.

36:39.490 --> 36:41.924
It seems that Ben
Reynolds Is rather keen

36:41.960 --> 36:44.269
to peddle his
equine wares.

36:44.300 --> 36:47.519
I contacted him, pretending
to be a man named Sigerson.

36:47.570 --> 36:49.265
Why Sigerson?

36:49.300 --> 36:51.860
It's a pseudonym
I use occasionally.

36:51.910 --> 36:54.538
Mmm. I outbid
the others,

36:54.580 --> 36:56.878
arranged a meeting,
contacted Captain Gregson.

36:56.910 --> 36:59.276
Here we are.

36:59.310 --> 37:01.005
The two parties are
meant to inspect things

37:01.050 --> 37:04.645
to their mutual satisfaction
and then switch cars.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.942
That's Reynolds.

37:08.290 --> 37:09.917
Why aren't
they arresting him?

37:09.960 --> 37:11.825
They haven't seen
the quagga yet.

37:20.030 --> 37:21.668
(sirens wailing)

37:21.700 --> 37:23.258
(tires screeching)

37:23.300 --> 37:25.302
OFFICER:
Freeze!

37:27.710 --> 37:30.929
You know, I could have arranged
all this with the department.

37:30.980 --> 37:32.675
You were asleep.

37:48.730 --> 37:51.051
It was a pleasure, Holmes.

37:51.100 --> 37:54.934
No, the pleasure was mine
and mine alone, Marcus.

38:10.920 --> 38:13.013
WATSON :
My dea rest Watson:

38:13.050 --> 38:14.711
Although it's been far too long

38:14.760 --> 38:16.648
since we laid eyes
on each other,

38:16.690 --> 38:19.523
I continue to follow your
career with great interest.

38:19.560 --> 38:22.393
I was sorry to hear about
the murder of Andrew Mittal

38:22.430 --> 38:24.921
and more than a bit unhappy
to learn that his death

38:24.970 --> 38:27.791
was an attempt on your own
most cherished life.

38:27.830 --> 38:29.991
I still believe
there's a game unfolding...

38:30.040 --> 38:33.009
MORIARTY:
...between Sherlock and I,
and you have made yourself

38:33.040 --> 38:36.009
a valued _
and essentIal contrIbutor.

38:36.040 --> 38:39.009
I won't have you removed
from play prematurely.

38:39.050 --> 38:42.019
Uninvited participants
are not welcome at the table,

38:42.050 --> 38:46.009
_ and their_intrusions_
WIll be dealt WIth accordIngly.

38:46.050 --> 38:48.780
I've got a situation.
Open 10 cell.

38:48.820 --> 38:51.653
(door buzzes)

38:51.690 --> 38:54.022
Call _the control room
ImmedIately.

38:54.060 --> 38:56.699
MORIARTY: There may well be
more rounds to be played

38:56.730 --> 38:59.369
between the two of us,
and until such time

38:59.400 --> 39:01.095
as we're both free to engage,

39:01.130 --> 39:04.702
I shall remain,
in delighted anticipation...

39:04.740 --> 39:07.732
Jamie Moriarty.

39:07.770 --> 39:09.476
Gregson called the
prison an hour ago.

39:09.510 --> 39:10.829
Elana March is dead.

39:10.880 --> 39:12.848
Moriarty was transferred
three weeks ago.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.711
He's not even sure
where they're holdIng her.

39:14.750 --> 39:17.878
Once they find out, someone will
go and ask her how she did this.

39:19.950 --> 39:21.986
It's a fool's errand.

39:22.020 --> 39:25.820
She will have left nothing
to connect her to the crime.

39:28.700 --> 39:30.554
And you?

39:33.870 --> 39:37.397
Ifeel...

39:37.440 --> 39:40.637
okay.

39:40.670 --> 39:43.707
I feel clear
about something.

39:43.740 --> 39:47.039
Our work, what we do...

39:47.080 --> 39:49.048
it's not just a job now.

39:49.080 --> 39:51.446
It's who I am.

39:51.490 --> 39:53.117
I'm a detective.

39:53.150 --> 39:55.710
I'm ready to embrace that.

39:55.760 --> 39:58.524
I live in this
world, your world,

39:58.560 --> 40:01.688
and I probably will
for the rest of my life.

40:01.730 --> 40:03.948
It isn't my world.

40:04.000 --> 40:07.527
It's our world.

40:10.140 --> 40:12.608
I understand that now.

40:15.040 --> 40:17.770
I accept it.
I know what it means.

40:17.810 --> 40:20.608
And what does it mean?

40:23.820 --> 40:27.039
It means that it's ridiculous
for me to think

40:27.090 --> 40:30.912
that... I can have
a normal life.

40:30.960 --> 40:34.123
I'm not gonna do that anymore.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.458
Just like I'm not gonna pretend

40:36.500 --> 40:39.492
this isn't the best place
for us to do our work.

40:39.530 --> 40:40.861
You're always welcome
to come here.

40:40.900 --> 40:42.629
You know that.

40:42.670 --> 40:45.059
You don't understand.

40:47.070 --> 40:49.538
I'm saying
that what I need to do

40:49.580 --> 40:52.902
is commit myself
to this work completely.

40:55.150 --> 40:57.869
The best place
for me to do that is here.

40:57.920 --> 40:59.888
I want to come back
to the brownstone.
