The man looked at the Convict
and asked the Officer:

00:13.958 --> 00:16.292
Does the prisoner know his sentence?

00:16.458 --> 00:19.000
No - said the Officer-
He will experience it on his own body.

00:19.208 --> 00:24.083
Franz Kafka.<i> In the Penal Colony.</i>

00:30.125 --> 00:36.042
Uruguay is under a dictatorship
after several decades of democracy.

00:39.500 --> 00:43.292
The Tupamaro Revolutionary Movement
has been defeated.

00:43.375 --> 00:47.458
Its survivors are in prison.

00:48.208 --> 00:52.375
On September 7th, nine Tupamaro prisoners

00:52.458 --> 00:57.958
are secretly taken hostage
by the military government.

00:58.958 --> 01:03.042
This is the story of three of them.

01:04.375 --> 01:08.625
A 12-YEAR NIGHT

02:19.750 --> 02:20.750
Troops!

02:20.792 --> 02:21.792
Proceed!

02:21.958 --> 02:24.625
- Move in!
- Quickly, quickly!

02:32.208 --> 02:33.625
Come on, come on!

03:02.208 --> 03:03.625
Come on, come on!

03:31.208 --> 03:33.625
Let's go, move it!

03:34.083 --> 03:35.417
Quickly!

03:47.458 --> 03:49.125
Let's go, keep moving!

03:54.333 --> 03:56.417
Come on! Move in!

04:39.417 --> 04:40.208
I need to take a shit.

04:40.375 --> 04:41.750
Quiet, little shit!

04:42.833 --> 04:43.833
Pepe?

04:44.333 --> 04:45.000
Ñato.

04:45.083 --> 04:46.792
Quiet! No talking!

04:46.958 --> 04:48.708
- Ruso, is that you?
- Silence!

04:49.792 --> 04:51.333
Keep your mouth shut, little shit!

04:57.375 --> 04:59.583
Then I'll have to shit right here.

04:59.750 --> 05:00.958
Sorry, guys.

05:01.375 --> 05:02.375
Silence!

05:04.958 --> 05:07.083
Let's go, in the truck!

05:08.125 --> 05:10.000
There's crap everywhere.
It stinks.

05:10.208 --> 05:12.833
Come on, in the truck.

05:30.167 --> 05:32.292
Let's go, let's go!

05:32.458 --> 05:33.750
Quickly!

05:35.500 --> 05:38.708
Come on, keep walking!

05:39.542 --> 05:41.292
Excuse me, Lieutenant.

05:41.417 --> 05:42.625
I've brought prisoners.

05:42.708 --> 05:46.042
José Mujica, Eleuterio Fernández
Huidobro and Mauricio Rosencof.

05:47.792 --> 05:49.083
Take them away.

05:59.875 --> 06:02.375
Come on, let's go!

06:03.250 --> 06:04.833
Come on, keep walking!

06:06.333 --> 06:07.625
Inside!

06:34.042 --> 06:36.208
Hold him there.

06:36.292 --> 06:37.583
Soak it in gasoline.

06:37.750 --> 06:39.417
More, more...

06:39.583 --> 06:42.083
- Suffocate him.
- No!

06:43.042 --> 06:44.542
I can't breathe!

06:44.792 --> 06:47.250
We're going to light you on fire.
Hold still.

06:47.333 --> 06:49.875
We're lighting you on fire, hold still.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.750
No!

06:51.917 --> 06:54.083
Son of a bitch!

06:54.250 --> 06:55.250
Shut up.

06:55.458 --> 06:58.208
Hold still. Hold still right there.

07:32.875 --> 07:33.917
On your feet!

07:34.458 --> 07:35.833
Stand against the wall.

07:35.917 --> 07:37.583
Stand still.

07:39.042 --> 07:41.500
Facing the wall without touching it.

08:09.375 --> 08:10.625
Don't move.

08:10.708 --> 08:12.417
Hold still.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.000
Hold still, don't look at me.
Face the wall.

08:15.208 --> 08:17.125
Hold still.

08:52.125 --> 08:56.125
ABANDON ALL HOPE,
YOU WHO ENTER HERE.

09:02.208 --> 09:03.875
Here, little shit.

09:14.917 --> 09:17.083
MINISTRY OF DEFENSE
RESOLUTION

09:20.292 --> 09:24.750
YOU CANNOT SPEAK.
NOT TO EACH OTHER OR TO ANYONE.

09:27.292 --> 09:29.958
THE SOLDIERS ARE FORBIDDEN
TO TALK TO YOU.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.750
One, two, three, four.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.625
One, two, three,

09:45.792 --> 09:46.792
four.

09:46.833 --> 09:48.792
One, two, three,

09:48.958 --> 09:50.333
four.

09:51.958 --> 09:55.083
One, two, three, four.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.292
Stop, stop, stop.

10:17.375 --> 10:18.917
Right there.

10:20.250 --> 10:23.042
What does he think he is?
A gymnast?

10:23.125 --> 10:25.333
He could use a kick in the kidneys.

10:25.417 --> 10:26.708
A gymnasticist!

10:26.792 --> 10:28.708
You stay still. Understood?

10:48.875 --> 10:54.250
12 MONTHS LATER

12:30.083 --> 12:32.208
<i>These guys can't talk to anyone.</i>

12:32.875 --> 12:34.583
<i>Nobody can talk to them.</i>

12:34.833 --> 12:37.292
<i>Remember that they're seditious
and subversive.</i>

12:37.458 --> 12:39.042
<i>Traitors to our country.</i>

12:39.542 --> 12:40.917
<i>They're very dangerous.</i>

12:40.958 --> 12:43.208
<i>They can be incredibly convincing.</i>

12:43.958 --> 12:46.458
<i>Contact with them must be minimum.</i>

12:46.542 --> 12:49.458
<i>We're the National Army.</i>

12:49.625 --> 12:51.958
<i>It took us years to win this war.</i>

12:52.000 --> 12:56.042
<i>And remember that humanity
was always saved</i>

12:56.125 --> 12:57.375
<i>at the last minute</i>

12:57.458 --> 12:59.833
<i>by a firing squad.</i>

13:16.667 --> 13:18.250
My dear Ruso,

13:20.958 --> 13:23.250
I'm here because your family
is pestering us.

13:24.042 --> 13:25.250
I'll let you see them,

13:25.333 --> 13:27.583
but don't make things harder,

13:27.667 --> 13:30.042
because you'll make it harder
for them, and for you.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.917
And you love your family a lot, right?

13:35.958 --> 13:37.083
You know what this is?

13:39.542 --> 13:42.000
It's a resolution from
Army Central Command.

13:42.750 --> 13:45.208
If any attack happens,
we'll have to kill you.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.125
And you know that's easy.

13:49.917 --> 13:51.750
You're not prisoners anymore.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.292
You're hostages.

13:55.958 --> 13:58.292
We should have killed you
when we could.

13:59.875 --> 14:02.250
Now we're going to drive you crazy.

14:04.625 --> 14:06.667
You lost the war, Pepe.

14:07.958 --> 14:09.750
<i>Now you are doomed.</i>

14:11.750 --> 14:14.625
And you wanted to change the world?

14:17.750 --> 14:19.833
Just look at yourselves.

14:21.667 --> 14:23.000
<i>I would kill myself.</i>

14:23.208 --> 14:25.292
<i>Why don't you kill yourselves?</i>

14:31.667 --> 14:32.667
Stay still.

14:33.708 --> 14:35.250
I said stay still.

14:53.458 --> 14:56.042
Look, this is barbaric.

14:56.958 --> 15:00.333
A firing squad
would be more humane.

15:12.042 --> 15:13.542
Rosencof, get ready.

15:28.125 --> 15:29.333
Dad.

15:30.208 --> 15:31.625
Hi!

15:32.417 --> 15:34.125
How are you, sweetheart?

15:36.542 --> 15:38.333
What beautiful eyes you have.

15:39.792 --> 15:41.333
And school?

15:41.458 --> 15:42.708
How are things at school?

15:42.875 --> 15:45.167
- We brought you food.
- Thanks, Mom.

15:45.250 --> 15:47.375
- And notebooks and books...
- Thanks, Mom.

15:47.542 --> 15:49.375
- How are you, darling?
- Fine.

15:49.458 --> 15:51.042
You're so big!

15:53.958 --> 15:55.417
What a lovely surprise.

15:56.917 --> 15:59.042
What do you do here every day?

16:01.125 --> 16:02.667
We walk.

16:03.250 --> 16:04.667
You have recess?

16:06.958 --> 16:08.500
Yeah, sure.

16:09.500 --> 16:13.125
We brought Alejandrita's
new glasses to show you.

16:13.833 --> 16:15.042
Put them on.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.583
Wait, wait.
Tell him to close his eyes.

16:17.792 --> 16:19.542
Close your eyes.

16:20.958 --> 16:22.417
I'm closing them.

16:23.375 --> 16:24.500
They're closed.

16:34.958 --> 16:36.875
- Can I open them?
- Yes.

16:46.667 --> 16:48.458
They look beautiful on you.

16:48.625 --> 16:53.000
Oh, Dad. These glasses make me cry.

16:54.208 --> 16:56.292
No, sweetie. Don't use them
if they make you cry.

16:57.292 --> 16:58.417
They make her cry?

16:59.417 --> 17:00.875
The lenses make her cry.

17:07.708 --> 17:08.750
Isaac...

17:10.500 --> 17:12.875
Hey, Dad. Are you okay?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.125
What's wrong?

17:14.708 --> 17:17.000
- Who is he?
- Mauricio.

17:17.917 --> 17:18.958
I came to see my son.

17:19.042 --> 17:21.583
- Isaac, please.
- Dad, it's me.

17:21.667 --> 17:23.750
- Where is my son?
- Calm down.

17:23.833 --> 17:25.958
- Isaac, sit down.
- Where is my son?

17:26.208 --> 17:28.792
- I came to see my son.
- Sit down.

17:28.958 --> 17:33.000
- Dad, it's me.
- No, please, sit down.

17:33.208 --> 17:34.042
Sit down.

17:34.125 --> 17:35.125
No!

17:35.250 --> 17:36.125
Isaac!

17:36.208 --> 17:37.833
Dad, are you okay?

17:38.583 --> 17:40.250
Dad!

17:40.417 --> 17:42.000
Don't move!

17:42.958 --> 17:44.042
Dad!

17:46.750 --> 17:49.375
- Isaac, no!
- Dad!

17:54.125 --> 17:55.708
Dad, it's me!

17:58.500 --> 17:59.500
Dad, it's me!

18:09.875 --> 18:11.708
Let's go!

18:12.875 --> 18:14.125
Come on!

803 DAYS

19:11.958 --> 19:13.625
Be careful!

19:14.250 --> 19:15.958
Quiet, little shit!

20:30.500 --> 20:32.833
Get out of there! Out!

20:42.833 --> 20:44.000
Merry Christmas!

23:38.333 --> 23:39.875
A, b, c...

D, e, f, g,...

24:11.083 --> 24:13.458
Merry Christmas, Ruso.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.958
Merry Christmas to you too, Ñato.

24:25.875 --> 24:29.958

1074 DAYS

24:42.042 --> 24:44.750
<i>Are we in Solis?</i>

24:44.917 --> 24:46.458
<i>I don't know.</i>

24:57.958 --> 24:59.875
<i>In 5th Cavalry.</i>

25:01.083 --> 25:03.208
<i>How do you know?</i>

25:03.375 --> 25:06.375
<i>By their boots.</i>

25:07.750 --> 25:11.542
<i>Where is Pepe?</i>

25:12.208 --> 25:13.417
<i>No idea.</i>

25:41.875 --> 25:43.875
<i>Checkmate.</i>

25:44.292 --> 25:46.875
<i>Checkmate how?</i>

25:48.208 --> 25:51.625
<i>With queen on D4.</i>

25:55.958 --> 25:56.958
You're shitting me.

25:57.667 --> 26:00.042
<i>Queen D4 I win.</i>

26:01.833 --> 26:05.208
<i>Arguing with you...</i>

26:05.708 --> 26:08.958
<i>is like talking to a wall.</i>

26:29.500 --> 26:31.667
Hurry up. Crap quickly.

26:38.250 --> 26:39.708
I can't like this.

26:39.875 --> 26:41.708
I can't squat, I can't shit.

26:42.000 --> 26:43.125
What do you want me to do?

26:43.208 --> 26:45.083
Loosen it a little bit for me.

26:45.292 --> 26:46.958
I'm not authorized.

26:47.125 --> 26:49.500
So I'll have to shit all over the place...

26:51.167 --> 26:52.958
Corporal, there's a problem.

26:53.542 --> 26:55.917
<i>He can't reach the toilet.
He can't defecate.</i>

26:57.708 --> 26:58.792
Show me.

27:00.792 --> 27:02.042
I can't bend over.

27:03.208 --> 27:05.667
- Gutiérrez, type it.
- Sergeant, sir.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.375
The prisoner is tied...

27:12.500 --> 27:13.750
Faster, faster!

27:13.958 --> 27:15.708
<i>In the neighborhood...</i>

27:16.000 --> 27:17.667
- Sergeant, sir.
- What is it?

27:41.583 --> 27:43.000
- Sergeant!
- Attention!

27:43.083 --> 27:45.125
- Lieutenant!
- What's going on?

27:45.292 --> 27:47.958
<i>A complicated circumstance.</i>

27:49.083 --> 27:51.667
You see, Lieutenant?
This is the situation we have.

27:51.958 --> 27:55.208
You call me for this?
You can't solve this yourself?

27:55.292 --> 27:57.542
Captain, we have a problem
in the bathroom.

27:57.708 --> 27:58.958
Is it clogged?

28:03.542 --> 28:05.542
You really need to take a crap?

28:09.625 --> 28:11.125
Major, sir.

28:12.458 --> 28:13.875
Attention!

28:20.042 --> 28:22.042
Are you all retards?

28:35.917 --> 28:37.583
Can somebody come in here?

28:43.875 --> 28:44.875

<i>Lose consciousness...</i>

29:34.792 --> 29:37.000
<i>Need to be precise...</i>

29:56.667 --> 29:59.375

It's impossible to stop thinking!

30:03.417 --> 30:07.042
<i>Stop. Stop.</i>

- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.

31:11.417 --> 31:12.417
I'm here to see my son.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.375
- Who?
- José Mujica.

31:14.458 --> 31:16.875
The courthouse said he might be here.

31:17.000 --> 31:18.458
Your ID.

31:20.125 --> 31:22.042
Sign this and wait here.

31:27.375 --> 31:30.375
<i>I brought you mate
and dulce de leche.</i>

31:30.583 --> 31:32.375

How's the neighborhood?

31:34.417 --> 31:37.125
<i>The neighborhood is fine.</i>

31:37.333 --> 31:38.833
And Grandpa?

31:38.917 --> 31:41.000
<i>Grandpa misses you.</i>

31:43.958 --> 31:45.000
Ma'am!

31:45.708 --> 31:48.250
They're checking documentation!

31:48.667 --> 31:50.375
Why don't you wait inside?

31:50.750 --> 31:53.083
No, I'm fine right here.

31:59.292 --> 32:00.417
Mom.

32:00.583 --> 32:02.125
Stop coming.

32:02.792 --> 32:05.250
<i>As long as I'm alive, I'll come.</i>

32:05.583 --> 32:07.333
<i>Even if I have to crawl.</i>

32:10.875 --> 32:12.083
Ma'am!

32:16.833 --> 32:19.625
I'm sorry, but your son isn't available.

32:20.417 --> 32:21.833
He isn't here?

32:21.958 --> 32:24.208
I don't have that information.

32:24.583 --> 32:26.125
Where is he?

32:26.333 --> 32:28.458
I don't have that information.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.542
What information do you have?

32:31.708 --> 32:33.458
The information I gave you.

32:34.083 --> 32:36.917
But what information did you give me?

32:37.042 --> 32:39.083
I don't have that information.

32:51.708 --> 32:53.250
Mom, come here!

32:55.625 --> 32:57.042
Come back!

33:00.000 --> 33:01.042
Mom...

34:32.042 --> 34:33.417
That's it.

35:03.833 --> 35:08.542
DO NOT CROSS

35:09.417 --> 35:13.542
1977
1529 DAYS

35:14.458 --> 35:18.917
I knew her because she was
Ñango's ex-girlfriend.

35:19.042 --> 35:21.125
And I always liked her.

35:21.333 --> 35:24.000
We started dancing
and I got closer to her.

35:24.208 --> 35:26.375
She smelled like soap.

35:26.542 --> 35:28.833
So clean.

35:28.958 --> 35:32.292
I hadn't been around that in a long time.

35:32.458 --> 35:36.042
- Brunette?
- Yeah.

35:36.250 --> 35:40.083
We danced to like two songs
and she said come tomorrow.

35:40.292 --> 35:43.792
I put on cologne, a nice shirt...

35:44.167 --> 35:47.292
When I went, she wasn't there.
I don't know if she stood me up.

35:47.375 --> 35:49.292
I should have got answered.

35:49.708 --> 35:52.167
I left her flowers, chocolates...

35:52.250 --> 35:55.417
- Which flowers?
- The flowers were...

35:55.542 --> 35:59.042
The ones with yellow in the middle.

35:59.250 --> 36:01.250
- Daisies.
- Right, daisies.

36:01.417 --> 36:05.667
I know women, always the same.
It happened to me once.

36:05.792 --> 36:07.958
- They leave you hanging.
- What did you do?

36:08.125 --> 36:09.750
Nothing, I never saw her again.

36:09.875 --> 36:12.500
I think they were mocking me.

36:13.833 --> 36:17.708
There was something.
You know when you feel it?

36:17.833 --> 36:19.125
We made eye contact...

36:19.625 --> 36:24.125
By the third song
we were closer together...

36:24.333 --> 36:26.958
And she gave me a kiss
right here on the cheek.

36:27.083 --> 36:31.208
And I was like, "No..."

36:31.375 --> 36:33.042
Stop! Stop...

36:34.625 --> 36:36.042
Silence!

36:36.833 --> 36:38.833
Stop, Barriola, please.

36:38.958 --> 36:40.667
- Barriola?
- Stop.

36:40.750 --> 36:42.875
How do you know my name?

36:43.000 --> 36:47.417
You never stop talking! The girl,
the ex-boyfriend, the dance, the kiss...

36:47.583 --> 36:50.500
You need to move.
She's interested, but make a move.

36:50.667 --> 36:51.583
Shut your mouth!

36:51.667 --> 36:54.208
Let me think. Listen.

36:54.542 --> 36:58.208
Maybe her boyfriend is in town
and that's why she's ignoring you.

36:58.333 --> 37:01.583
How do you know?
Shut up or I'll kick your ass.

37:01.667 --> 37:03.125
Here's what we'll do.

37:03.333 --> 37:05.833
Bring me down a pen
and paper and I'll help you.

37:06.333 --> 37:08.125
- I want to help you, really.
- Shut up!

37:08.208 --> 37:10.958
You have to surprise women, Barriola.

37:11.375 --> 37:12.542
Bring me a pen and paper...

37:12.708 --> 37:14.417
I'll stick the pen up your ass!

37:14.542 --> 37:17.625
Please, Barriola, let's solve this.
I can't listen to you anymore.

37:17.708 --> 37:19.750
Stop calling me by my name!

37:32.208 --> 37:33.667
Hey, little shit.

37:36.292 --> 37:38.292
What do you want
the paper and pen for?

37:38.458 --> 37:40.667
For you to write her a letter.

37:40.958 --> 37:42.292
What for?

37:44.000 --> 37:47.542
Because you said she was hot,
I thought you liked her.

37:50.125 --> 37:51.375
You dictate,

37:51.458 --> 37:52.958
I'll write it down.

37:53.125 --> 37:54.125
But I'm warning you,

37:54.208 --> 37:57.625
if you're pulling my leg,
I'll kick your ass.

38:01.458 --> 38:05.625
"And here, in the infinite solitude
of guard duty,

38:08.833 --> 38:10.958
imprisoned by your absence..."

38:11.000 --> 38:13.000
Slow down, slow down.

38:14.542 --> 38:17.000
"Imprisoned by your absence,

38:18.833 --> 38:23.875
I can feel my tear ducts

38:24.333 --> 38:25.958
quivering."

38:31.625 --> 38:33.875
And? What now?

38:34.208 --> 38:36.375
- What do you mean?
- What do I do?

38:37.500 --> 38:39.375
You send it to her, soldier!

38:50.583 --> 38:53.292
On your feet, let's go.

39:00.333 --> 39:01.917
Shitty Tupamaro.

39:02.042 --> 39:04.417
When the sergeant gets here
you'll get the club.

39:14.958 --> 39:16.917
Take off his hood, soldier.

39:18.583 --> 39:20.042
Everyone get out.

39:20.417 --> 39:22.167
Everybody out!

39:22.583 --> 39:23.958
Move it!

39:33.292 --> 39:35.250
So you're the writer.

39:39.125 --> 39:41.500
Look, I have a problem.

39:45.042 --> 39:47.250
There's a girl I like.

39:48.125 --> 39:50.375
I heard you can help me.

39:52.792 --> 39:53.958
Who is she?

39:55.083 --> 39:56.417
What's she like?

39:57.208 --> 39:58.708
She's...

39:58.875 --> 40:02.042
brunette, pretty...

40:02.792 --> 40:07.292
I met her last week.
We were playing around.

40:08.042 --> 40:11.208
I asked her out,
but she doesn't want to.

40:21.708 --> 40:23.083
What's her name?

40:23.667 --> 40:24.750
Nelly.

40:31.125 --> 40:33.792
- Brunette, you said?
- Yeah.

40:33.958 --> 40:36.208
She works with her mom in the bakery.

40:37.750 --> 40:40.208
And she makes warm bread
in the morning?

40:40.667 --> 40:42.792
Yeah, that bread with fat.

40:54.417 --> 40:55.542
Just...

40:56.333 --> 40:59.208
sign it with your name
so it looks better.

41:12.833 --> 41:14.000
Thank you.

41:19.208 --> 41:22.042
Can I keep the notebook?

41:26.458 --> 41:27.750
Please.

41:42.625 --> 41:43.833
Thank you.

41:43.958 --> 41:45.292
Soldiers!

41:47.375 --> 41:48.958
Take him away.

42:16.417 --> 42:18.417
I brought hot bread.

42:19.500 --> 42:20.500
Thank you.

42:25.583 --> 42:27.208
We went out last night.

42:29.250 --> 42:32.208
But the girl is very confused,
she has a lot of doubts.

42:32.292 --> 42:35.333
What doubts, if I may ask?

42:35.500 --> 42:36.958
I...

42:38.417 --> 42:40.750
got married very young.

42:42.042 --> 42:43.917
I was still in the militia

42:44.042 --> 42:46.208
and I met another girl.

42:47.583 --> 42:50.375
When I went back home,
I was a different man.

42:50.875 --> 42:52.542
I had changed a lot.

42:53.333 --> 42:57.458
I have a daughter from that marriage.

42:58.292 --> 43:00.125
She's all grown up.

43:00.333 --> 43:01.792
She doesn't talk to me.

43:02.625 --> 43:04.042
That hurts.

43:07.667 --> 43:11.458
And now that I want
to make a new life for myself,

43:11.958 --> 43:15.583
it's like a pebble in my shoe.

43:16.708 --> 43:17.792
Sergeant,

43:20.667 --> 43:22.750
we all make mistakes.

43:59.250 --> 44:00.250
Goal!

44:01.625 --> 44:02.708
Goal!

44:07.583 --> 44:08.875
Help me.

44:09.875 --> 44:11.500
How do I answer?

44:15.083 --> 44:17.333
What are you looking for with her?

44:17.958 --> 44:19.917
I don't know, I'm older now.

44:20.042 --> 44:22.958
I don't want to end my life alone,
I want to end it with her.

44:23.958 --> 44:25.292
Should I write that?

44:27.000 --> 44:28.792
You're the writer.

44:30.500 --> 44:31.875
What would you do?

44:32.708 --> 44:34.500
I wouldn't tell her yet.

44:35.625 --> 44:37.708
We need to make her fall in love first.

44:53.458 --> 44:54.458
Yes.

45:10.583 --> 45:11.958
Of you.

45:12.583 --> 45:13.917
<i>Of me.</i>

45:14.542 --> 45:15.708
<i>Of the air.</i>

45:17.833 --> 45:19.542
<i>Of the shadow of before.</i>

45:19.625 --> 45:20.792
<i>Of after.</i>

45:24.625 --> 45:26.125
<i>Of who knows love.</i>

45:31.833 --> 45:34.292
<i>Give me back the Word.</i>

45:36.625 --> 45:38.583
Keep pedalling, I'm letting go.

45:42.417 --> 45:43.417
Good, sweetie!

45:45.375 --> 45:46.417
Keep going!

45:48.458 --> 45:50.542
Good! You're on your own!

45:50.708 --> 45:52.292
Look at me, Daddy!

46:36.750 --> 46:38.208
Raise my hood.

46:38.375 --> 46:40.750
Please, only for a second.

47:14.417 --> 47:18.542
1978
2024 DAYS

47:28.417 --> 47:31.042
Let's go, hurry up!

47:36.708 --> 47:39.208
Keep moving, let's go.

47:51.833 --> 47:53.125
Where the fuck are we?

48:01.625 --> 48:03.375
Please, where are we?

48:06.292 --> 48:07.667
Where are we?

48:08.667 --> 48:10.208
Open up!

48:10.375 --> 48:11.792
Let us out of here!

48:41.750 --> 48:42.958
<i>Don't play dumb, Mujica.</i>

48:43.125 --> 48:45.292
<i>Tell me about...</i>

48:46.250 --> 48:47.750
<i>your contacts.</i>

48:47.917 --> 48:51.417
<i>I'm not going to think,
I'm not going to think...</i>

48:51.625 --> 48:53.917
<i>You must have contacts...</i>

48:55.417 --> 48:59.458
I'm not going to think!
I'm not going to think!

48:59.625 --> 49:01.250
You won't get shit out of me!

49:01.333 --> 49:03.042
I'm not going to think!

49:03.125 --> 49:04.333
<i>What are your next movements?</i>

49:04.417 --> 49:05.667
What are you saying?

49:08.458 --> 49:11.875
Speak clearly!
What are you saying? Speak clearly!

49:12.000 --> 49:15.167
Tell me what you want!
Are you on my left or right?

49:15.250 --> 49:16.667
What the fuck?

49:16.833 --> 49:17.958
What are you saying?

49:18.000 --> 49:19.833
What? Go ahead, talk!

49:20.875 --> 49:21.875
Speak!

49:21.958 --> 49:22.958
Go ahead!

49:23.125 --> 49:24.625
I'm not going to think in my head!

49:24.792 --> 49:26.833
You won't get shit out of me!

49:26.958 --> 49:28.792
I'm not going to think!

49:31.458 --> 49:32.958
Let him out!

49:33.458 --> 49:35.958
Let us out of here!

49:36.083 --> 49:37.708
Let him out!

49:38.125 --> 49:39.250
Pepe!

49:39.750 --> 49:41.792
Let us out!

49:44.250 --> 49:47.542
Come here if you're a man!
Come here!

50:51.458 --> 50:52.792
Hi, Ñato.

51:12.542 --> 51:13.750
Ñato.

51:18.625 --> 51:20.750
<i>There's someone I want you to meet.</i>

51:23.375 --> 51:24.958
<i>She was born in the barracks</i>

51:25.042 --> 51:28.208
<i>and she wants to meet you, Ñato.
She wants to meet you.</i>

51:30.917 --> 51:32.208
<i>Gabrielita.</i>

51:36.375 --> 51:38.458
<i>Gabrielita wants to meet you,</i>

51:38.625 --> 51:39.958
<i>but it's not easy.</i>

51:44.958 --> 51:47.000
<i>They're constantly moving you.</i>

51:48.083 --> 51:51.958
You're in Melo now,
and I'm in Punta Rieles.

51:52.208 --> 51:54.375
I don't want her to see me like this.

51:54.708 --> 51:56.708
She'll think her father is living dead.

51:56.792 --> 51:58.125
Ñato...

52:01.292 --> 52:03.000
She'll think she has no father.

52:13.417 --> 52:14.417
<i>Ñato...</i>

52:16.875 --> 52:18.792
<i>This will be over soon.</i>

52:22.917 --> 52:24.083
<i>What do we do?</i>

53:37.917 --> 53:40.125
<i>No, Sir. No, Sir.</i>

54:12.792 --> 54:14.125
<i>Tell me, Mujica.</i>

54:14.208 --> 54:16.208
<i>Who are your contacts here?</i>

54:17.458 --> 54:18.917
<i>What do you know about Ortega?</i>

54:20.583 --> 54:22.208
What is it you propose?

54:22.333 --> 54:23.500
<i>Tell me about...</i>

54:23.667 --> 54:25.417
<i>the Nicaraguan revolution.</i>

54:25.583 --> 54:29.333
<i>Communists are all the same,
none of you know anything.</i>

54:29.500 --> 54:31.958
<i>Only when it suits you.</i>

54:32.083 --> 54:34.708
Do you agree yes, or do you agree no?

54:50.208 --> 54:51.417
Another round?

54:52.250 --> 54:54.750
We have to figure out
how we'll get the tools.

54:54.917 --> 54:57.458
We have to try them out.

54:57.958 --> 54:58.833
And the noise.

54:58.958 --> 55:00.638
We have to try them out
and do noise tests.

55:00.708 --> 55:02.458
She said it would be fine.

55:02.625 --> 55:04.042
The basement?

55:04.208 --> 55:06.667
- The basement is perfect.
- Can you hear outside?

55:06.750 --> 55:09.083
You can't hear anything. It's huge.

55:10.250 --> 55:11.250
Thank you.

55:13.000 --> 55:14.833
Add two people to the middle column.

55:14.917 --> 55:16.797
- That's where people will come.
- Try them out.

55:17.708 --> 55:19.333
How are we going to do it?

55:19.667 --> 55:21.083
The casino is open

55:21.917 --> 55:23.958
from 8 to 5. Only during carnival.

55:24.000 --> 55:26.833
- How many will participate?
- Fifteen.

55:26.958 --> 55:28.833
- Fifteen?
- Fifteen maximum.

55:28.958 --> 55:30.042
That's a lot.

55:30.250 --> 55:33.333
<i>The Tupamaros have pulled off what people
are calling the heist of the century</i>

55:33.500 --> 55:37.125
<i>against the multi-million-dollar
tobacco company Maihlos.</i>

55:37.292 --> 55:40.750
<i>Thanks to documents
revealed by the Tupamaros</i>

55:40.917 --> 55:42.875
<i>the judge ordered a prison sentence</i>

55:43.000 --> 55:44.833
<i>for Narciso Eduardo Maihlos</i>

55:44.958 --> 55:48.583
<i>for tax fraud and contraband.</i>

56:06.208 --> 56:07.208
Are you okay?

56:07.917 --> 56:09.000
Yes.

56:09.208 --> 56:10.542
Another round?

56:14.375 --> 56:16.042
Do you know you're being recorded?

56:17.792 --> 56:19.000
Do you know?

56:20.208 --> 56:21.625
Anything else?

56:25.083 --> 56:26.083
Pepe.

56:26.333 --> 56:27.542
Pepe.

56:27.708 --> 56:29.250
You're being recorded.

56:29.875 --> 56:31.250
You have an antenna.

56:38.625 --> 56:39.458
<i>The basement?</i>

56:39.542 --> 56:41.583
<i>The basement is perfect.</i>

56:41.708 --> 56:43.000
<i>Can you hear outside?</i>

56:43.208 --> 56:45.375
<i>You can't hear anything. It's huge.</i>

56:45.542 --> 56:47.708
<i>- How are we going to do it?
- Only during carnival.</i>

56:56.292 --> 56:57.167
Stop it!

56:57.250 --> 56:58.917
Stop it!

56:58.958 --> 57:00.292
Shut up!

57:00.375 --> 57:01.625
Shut up!

57:04.083 --> 57:05.125
Another round?

57:39.917 --> 57:40.958
Sorry.

57:43.417 --> 57:44.958
I got the lyrics wrong.

57:53.625 --> 57:54.625
Mom?

58:15.708 --> 58:16.958
Identification.

58:19.958 --> 58:20.792
Sit down.

58:20.875 --> 58:22.250
Damn it, sit down!

58:22.417 --> 58:24.250
Stop, stop!

58:26.583 --> 58:28.292
Stop, Pepe!

59:13.875 --> 59:18.250
<i>In a successful operation carried out
by the Montevideo police,</i>

59:18.333 --> 59:23.958
<i>a rebel from a known gang of conspirers
was seriously wounded.</i>

59:25.250 --> 59:28.208
<i>The stranger who was carrying fake ID</i>

59:28.292 --> 59:30.625
<i>turned out to be José Alberto Mujica.</i>

59:30.792 --> 59:34.292
<i>Wanted for some time
as a member of the organization.</i>

59:35.125 --> 59:37.792
<i>Mujica is now being held
in a military hospital</i>

59:37.958 --> 59:39.958
<i>in critical condition.</i>

1:00:30.375 --> 1:00:33.917
How old are you, kid?

1:00:36.042 --> 1:00:39.417
You hadn't even been born
when they put us in here.

1:00:41.208 --> 1:00:43.083
They forgot about us.

1:00:49.875 --> 1:00:51.875
They forgot about us.

1:01:27.375 --> 1:01:31.500
1979
2391 DAYS

1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:44.667
<i>And if this were</i>

1:02:45.125 --> 1:02:48.125
<i>my last poem,</i>

1:02:48.208 --> 1:02:50.250
<i>rebellious and sad,</i>

1:02:50.333 --> 1:02:54.042
<i>worn out but whole,</i>

1:02:54.250 --> 1:02:58.042
<i>I would only write one word:</i>

1:02:59.625 --> 1:03:03.625
<i>Companion.</i>

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:11.917
<i>Visit tomorrow.
First time see Gabrielita.</i>

1:03:13.208 --> 1:03:16.000
<i>I'm scared, Ruso.</i>

1:03:16.208 --> 1:03:20.042
<i>You have a daughter.
What do I do?</i>

1:03:21.833 --> 1:03:24.708
<i>Tell her a story.</i>

1:03:26.542 --> 1:03:29.667
<i>I don't know any.</i>

1:03:32.208 --> 1:03:34.083
<i>Tell her this one:</i>

1:03:34.292 --> 1:03:37.542
<i>Then the little girl receives a gift:</i>

1:03:37.917 --> 1:03:40.000
A machine that makes her dreams

1:03:40.083 --> 1:03:41.083
come true.

1:03:41.542 --> 1:03:42.958
Then one day the girl

1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.500
was with her mother
and her mother said:

1:03:45.667 --> 1:03:48.333
"Go and feed the blue chicks."

1:03:48.500 --> 1:03:51.083
"Mom, there's no such thing
as blue chicks."

1:03:52.125 --> 1:03:53.458
"Go anyway."

1:03:53.958 --> 1:03:56.042
And when she went to feed them,

1:03:56.125 --> 1:04:00.250
she started hearing chicks
cheeping everywhere.

1:04:00.958 --> 1:04:01.958
- Cheep, cheep!
- Right.

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:04.208
- Cheep, cheep!
- That's right.

1:04:04.375 --> 1:04:07.792
That night, when she goes to bed,
she lies down to sleep

1:04:08.083 --> 1:04:10.542
and she dreams of elephants.

1:04:10.708 --> 1:04:12.125
When she wakes up the next day,

1:04:12.333 --> 1:04:15.583
she sees elephants
walking around her house

1:04:15.750 --> 1:04:18.542
and she says,
"Look, Mom! Elephants!"

1:04:18.708 --> 1:04:20.125
Thirty seconds.

1:04:24.792 --> 1:04:29.125
Gabi, the next time you come,
I'll finish the story, okay?

1:04:30.292 --> 1:04:33.125
Daddy, why don't you have any hands?

1:04:35.917 --> 1:04:37.375
No, I do have hands.

1:04:37.542 --> 1:04:40.792
It's just that my hands
transform as well.

1:04:40.958 --> 1:04:43.250
They turn into animals, look.

1:04:44.208 --> 1:04:45.292
Look.

1:04:46.125 --> 1:04:47.708
A butterfly.

1:04:48.792 --> 1:04:50.542
What do butterflies do?

1:04:51.333 --> 1:04:52.333
That's it.

1:04:55.250 --> 1:04:56.500
A monkey.

1:04:59.375 --> 1:05:00.542
A dog.

1:05:03.542 --> 1:05:05.333
The visit is over.

1:05:09.792 --> 1:05:12.083
Bye, Gabi. I love you a lot.

1:07:43.917 --> 1:07:46.792
<i>Francisco Franco's heart
stopped beating...</i>

1:07:47.542 --> 1:07:49.250
<i>Caudillo of Spain...</i>

1:07:54.417 --> 1:07:56.958
<i>...after intervention by the army...</i>

1:07:57.125 --> 1:07:59.458
<i>"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"

1:07:59.625 --> 1:08:02.667

<i>Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher</i>

1:08:05.625 --> 1:08:07.750
<i>won Best Actor and Best Actress.</i>

1:08:14.792 --> 1:08:18.417
<i>For the signing of the agreement
at Camp David,</i>

1:08:18.500 --> 1:08:21.000
<i>attended by the ex-President

1:08:21.208 --> 1:08:22.917
<i>Jimmy Carter...</i>

1:08:23.042 --> 1:08:27.500
<i>It might hail the next few days

1:08:36.458 --> 1:08:38.458
They have the basics, a bed,

1:08:38.542 --> 1:08:41.417
a curtain, light,
we're always attentive

1:08:41.500 --> 1:08:44.792
to requirements for general hygiene,

1:08:44.958 --> 1:08:48.458
rations or anything else
they might request,

1:08:48.625 --> 1:08:51.208
they're attended to...

1:09:15.958 --> 1:09:18.875
Say anything stupid
and we'll rip your head off.

1:09:19.333 --> 1:09:20.583
Got it?

1:09:35.292 --> 1:09:36.792
What is your name?

1:09:37.625 --> 1:09:39.125
State your name.

1:09:42.042 --> 1:09:44.458
Eleuterio Fernández Huidobro.

1:09:44.625 --> 1:09:45.958
Are you all right?

1:09:46.125 --> 1:09:47.375
The prisoner is fine.

1:09:47.542 --> 1:09:49.375
I'd like to hear it from him.

1:09:51.708 --> 1:09:53.333
INTERNATIONAL
RED CROSS COMMITTEE

1:09:58.958 --> 1:10:00.542
They barely feed us.

1:10:01.042 --> 1:10:03.333
We're not allowed to talk to each other.

1:10:03.500 --> 1:10:06.208
We have nothing.
We've never seen a judge.

1:10:06.375 --> 1:10:07.417
We have nothing at all!

1:10:07.583 --> 1:10:08.417
They don't feed us!

1:10:08.542 --> 1:10:10.583
They won't even let us
go to the bathroom!

1:10:10.750 --> 1:10:14.167
The Red Cross dictates that
all prisoners must be treated fairly.

1:10:14.250 --> 1:10:16.458
- You want to use the bathroom?
- Of course I do.

1:10:16.542 --> 1:10:18.083
Take him to the bathroom immediately!

1:10:19.625 --> 1:10:20.708
What is your name?

1:10:20.875 --> 1:10:22.500
State your name.

1:10:26.958 --> 1:10:28.958
Eleuterio Fernández Huidobro.

1:10:29.417 --> 1:10:30.875
Dismissed.

1:10:31.292 --> 1:10:33.208
I said dismissed.

1:10:49.708 --> 1:10:51.042
State your name.

1:10:51.625 --> 1:10:52.667
Mauricio Rosencof.

1:10:53.708 --> 1:10:55.250
Dismissed.

1:10:59.375 --> 1:11:00.375
What is your name?

1:11:01.417 --> 1:11:02.625
José Alberto Mujica.

1:11:02.750 --> 1:11:04.417
Dismissed.

1:11:46.042 --> 1:11:48.708
Attention. Ten-hut!

1:11:56.792 --> 1:11:58.667
Take off his hood and get out.

1:12:02.917 --> 1:12:04.625
What the fuck is that?

1:12:05.208 --> 1:12:08.083
They made me come from Montevideo
for that crap so talk fast.

1:12:08.167 --> 1:12:10.833
Are you taking up arms again?

1:12:10.958 --> 1:12:13.833
What bullshit is that?
Contact with the outside?

1:12:13.958 --> 1:12:15.250
What for and who?

1:12:18.958 --> 1:12:21.542
What is the point of all this?
Go ahead.

1:12:22.667 --> 1:12:24.750
I remember how to make you talk.

1:12:24.833 --> 1:12:27.542
I'm being nice to you
so don't treat me like a fool.

1:12:27.708 --> 1:12:29.250
Did you make this?

1:12:29.708 --> 1:12:30.917
Give me the code.

1:12:31.042 --> 1:12:33.958
The message, damn it!
Give me the message right now!

1:12:36.208 --> 1:12:38.792
It's not a message,
it's a martingale.

1:12:39.375 --> 1:12:42.750
A system of chances to play roulette.

1:12:49.542 --> 1:12:51.333
Are you fucking with me?

1:12:51.958 --> 1:12:53.042
May I?

1:12:54.792 --> 1:12:57.500
A is the initial bet.

1:12:58.083 --> 1:13:00.458
B is the chance of losing.

1:13:00.875 --> 1:13:03.083
And N is the number of tries

1:13:03.167 --> 1:13:05.208
between the maximum and minimum bet.

1:13:05.375 --> 1:13:07.792
Let's suppose
your maximum bet is 1,000

1:13:08.125 --> 1:13:09.958
and the minimum is 10.

1:13:10.125 --> 1:13:11.750
You have to always play

1:13:11.833 --> 1:13:13.958
two chips at a time either red or black.

1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:17.583
That way the chances of winning
are higher. It's 50.5 %.

1:13:17.750 --> 1:13:21.000
So A=7, P=5

1:13:21.208 --> 1:13:23.917
and N=0,53.

1:13:24.125 --> 1:13:27.375
That gives you a chance
at winning of 20, 40,

1:13:27.500 --> 1:13:29.958
60, 80, 120, 360,

1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:31.583
460...

1:13:37.417 --> 1:13:39.042
You guys never change.

1:13:43.750 --> 1:13:46.833
Do you really think you'll beat
a whole system?

1:13:47.917 --> 1:13:51.333
It's too bad I didn't kill you
when I had the chance.

1:13:54.708 --> 1:13:57.667
Neither of us will ever forget that day.

1:14:01.125 --> 1:14:05.292
APRIL 14TH, 1972

1:14:09.833 --> 1:14:11.250
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

1:14:14.792 --> 1:14:16.583
Mom, I forgot my pencil case.

1:14:16.708 --> 1:14:17.708
Oh, darling.

1:14:18.083 --> 1:14:21.750
Don't worry, go inside and I'll go home
and bring it to you.

1:14:22.208 --> 1:14:23.083
Have fun.

1:14:23.167 --> 1:14:24.208
Bye.

1:14:38.542 --> 1:14:43.500
<i>Today, April 14th, 1972,
we leave behind Uruguay's</i>

1:14:43.667 --> 1:14:46.042
<i>bloodiest day in the 20th century.</i>

1:14:46.208 --> 1:14:49.167
<i>MLN Tupamaro commandos

<i>In only hours, deputy commissioner

<i>navy captain...</i>

This is a declaration of war.

<i>...deputy commissioner Reyes.

1:15:08.667 --> 1:15:09.875
Turn it off.

1:15:10.500 --> 1:15:11.292
What?

1:15:11.417 --> 1:15:12.417
Turn off the radio.

1:15:19.208 --> 1:15:20.417
I don't hear anything.

1:15:21.500 --> 1:15:22.875
Exactly.

1:15:23.708 --> 1:15:25.208
Something's wrong.

1:17:18.292 --> 1:17:19.583
Move in!

1:17:54.417 --> 1:17:55.833
Answer it.

1:18:05.417 --> 1:18:06.750
They're down too.

1:18:11.583 --> 1:18:12.792
Move out.

1:18:16.417 --> 1:18:17.875
Tell me your name.

1:18:20.875 --> 1:18:22.042
What's your name?

1:18:23.750 --> 1:18:26.500
Luis Martirena.

1:18:26.667 --> 1:18:27.833
Luis Martirena.

1:18:28.083 --> 1:18:30.417
Good. So you're alive.

1:18:34.417 --> 1:18:37.083
<i>At 2 P.M. at Amazonas Street...</i>

1:18:37.292 --> 1:18:38.458
What do we do?

<i>...near Aconcagua,

<i>Two guerrillas were killed.

1:18:48.875 --> 1:18:50.292
Did you hear that?

1:18:50.958 --> 1:18:52.375
There were four of them.

1:18:53.042 --> 1:18:54.792
Only two dead.

1:18:54.875 --> 1:18:58.333
<i>...different clashes

1:19:08.333 --> 1:19:09.583
They're alive.

1:19:09.708 --> 1:19:11.792
Call Marcos and Cabrera.

1:19:11.958 --> 1:19:13.667
We have to prepare a rescue team.

1:21:44.708 --> 1:21:47.042
Shout that there are two of us.

1:21:47.250 --> 1:21:48.458
Shout my ass.

1:21:49.667 --> 1:21:52.333
I'm not leaving here alive.

1:21:57.250 --> 1:21:58.250
What's going on?

1:21:58.958 --> 1:22:00.125
Lower your weapon.

1:22:00.333 --> 1:22:01.875
There are two of us!

1:22:02.000 --> 1:22:03.417
We surrender!

1:22:05.250 --> 1:22:06.958
We surrender!

1:22:10.958 --> 1:22:13.000
<i>The world is full of idealists.</i>

1:22:13.833 --> 1:22:16.875
<i>Hell is full of good intentions.</i>

1:22:17.167 --> 1:22:18.958
This is your hell.

1:22:19.458 --> 1:22:22.583
I take responsibility for my mistakes
and the consequences.

1:22:22.667 --> 1:22:26.000
No, you take responsibility
for neither.

1:22:26.083 --> 1:22:28.208
We forced you to take responsibility.

1:22:29.125 --> 1:22:30.458
Your defeat

1:22:30.583 --> 1:22:31.792
forces you to.

1:22:31.958 --> 1:22:33.958
I did what I did because I believed in it.

1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:36.875
<i>I'm responsible and I accept
my punishment.</i>

1:22:36.958 --> 1:22:38.292
<i>Not you or anyone else</i>

1:22:38.375 --> 1:22:40.125
will take me for defeated.

1:22:42.000 --> 1:22:44.208
So you're not defeated?

1:22:46.458 --> 1:22:51.250
It's not the years that passed,
but think about the years that await you.

1:22:51.458 --> 1:22:53.583
You'll never get out of here.

1:22:54.208 --> 1:22:55.875
I might die here,

1:22:56.958 --> 1:22:58.375
but when that happens,

1:23:00.333 --> 1:23:02.250
I know the weight of my burden.

1:23:02.792 --> 1:23:04.000
But you,

1:23:04.208 --> 1:23:06.750
do you know how much yours weighs?

1:23:07.958 --> 1:23:09.875
<i>I belonged to this world.</i>

1:23:11.167 --> 1:23:13.250
<i>Now everything is foreign to me.
The sunrise,</i>

1:23:13.375 --> 1:23:14.875
the sound of the birds...

1:23:16.375 --> 1:23:18.208
You're foreign to me.

1:24:04.708 --> 1:24:07.542
- Hello, son. How are you?
- Fine, Mom.

1:24:08.625 --> 1:24:10.583
Grandpa sends his love.

1:24:11.542 --> 1:24:13.958
Always reminding me
to bring you things.

1:24:15.500 --> 1:24:18.000
He says: "Don't forget to bring
<i>dulce de leche</i>

1:24:18.500 --> 1:24:20.625
and two kilos of<i> mate."</i>

1:24:21.125 --> 1:24:23.458
I know they're going
to take away some things,

1:24:23.625 --> 1:24:25.917
but something might be left.

1:24:26.250 --> 1:24:28.375
- Is that okay?
- Mom.

1:24:28.958 --> 1:24:30.750
You have to stop coming.

1:24:30.958 --> 1:24:32.125
What?

1:24:32.333 --> 1:24:33.333
Why?

1:24:33.792 --> 1:24:36.625
It's too long to explain, Mom.

1:24:36.750 --> 1:24:41.583
They're persecuting us,
it's like an attack

1:24:41.708 --> 1:24:44.250
with sound, ultrasound, I don't know.

1:24:44.417 --> 1:24:47.125
My ear is hot. Listen, Mom.

1:24:47.292 --> 1:24:50.292
They put a voice or an antenna
inside me.

1:24:50.417 --> 1:24:52.250
I can't stop thinking.

1:24:52.417 --> 1:24:55.875
Whenever I stop, they attack me again.

1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.542
They haven't gotten into
my thoughts for a while...

1:24:58.708 --> 1:24:59.917
Stop.

1:25:00.917 --> 1:25:03.583
What matters is I have it
all under control.

1:25:03.750 --> 1:25:06.583
- But you have to not come for a while.
- Son...

1:25:06.750 --> 1:25:09.583
What do you think they are?

1:25:09.708 --> 1:25:12.958
- Nuns in a charity?
- Shut up!

1:25:13.125 --> 1:25:14.125
Shut up!

1:25:16.750 --> 1:25:17.875
Listen to me!

1:25:18.208 --> 1:25:21.083
I'm the one you have
to listen to. I'm your mother.

1:25:21.542 --> 1:25:23.208
They want to drive you crazy.

1:25:23.292 --> 1:25:25.333
You can't let them.

1:25:25.833 --> 1:25:27.375
Do you understand?

1:25:27.667 --> 1:25:28.792
Mom...

1:25:28.958 --> 1:25:30.292
Mom my ass!

1:25:30.458 --> 1:25:31.917
Mom my ass!

1:25:32.042 --> 1:25:33.042
Listen to me.

1:25:33.083 --> 1:25:36.750
Listen to what I have to say.
You have to resist.

1:25:36.833 --> 1:25:38.292
Resist

1:25:38.458 --> 1:25:40.625
any way you can,
no matter what happens.

1:25:40.708 --> 1:25:44.000
Resist and don't let them kill you.

1:25:45.500 --> 1:25:47.000
I don't know how.

1:25:49.542 --> 1:25:50.917
Yes, you do.

1:25:52.292 --> 1:25:53.958
The only defeated

1:25:54.125 --> 1:25:56.292
are the ones who stop fighting.

1:25:58.083 --> 1:26:01.375
You'll get through this and move on.

1:26:02.708 --> 1:26:04.125
And nobody...

1:26:05.333 --> 1:26:08.208
Nobody will take
what you have inside.

1:26:37.875 --> 1:26:39.667
Heat the water at least.

1:27:15.750 --> 1:27:20.250
168 years ago today,

1:27:20.625 --> 1:27:23.958
by the hand of our leader,

1:27:24.417 --> 1:27:29.000
our magnificent commander,
one of a kind on Earth,

1:27:29.500 --> 1:27:31.833
when the people gathered

1:27:31.917 --> 1:27:33.958
to seek their freedom...

1:27:34.000 --> 1:27:36.333
I want my<i> mate</i> and my potty!

1:27:36.417 --> 1:27:38.458
I need to take a shit!

1:27:38.750 --> 1:27:40.333
I want my<i> mate</i> and my potty!

1:27:40.583 --> 1:27:43.625
Fucking son of a bitch!

1:27:43.875 --> 1:27:45.792
I want my potty!

1:27:46.042 --> 1:27:49.333
Remembering the historic process...

1:27:49.417 --> 1:27:51.625
Give me back my potty!

1:27:51.792 --> 1:27:52.958
And my<i> mate!</i>

1:27:53.375 --> 1:27:55.583
You're going to smell
what comes out of my ass!

1:27:55.750 --> 1:27:58.542
Your Sunday clothes will stink!

1:27:59.333 --> 1:28:01.000
I want my potty!

1:28:01.083 --> 1:28:02.917
I need to take a shit!

1:28:03.042 --> 1:28:04.083
Filthy bastard!

1:28:04.292 --> 1:28:05.833
I want my potty!

1:28:06.375 --> 1:28:09.167
Fucking son of a bitch!

1:28:09.500 --> 1:28:10.542
Be quiet.

1:28:11.042 --> 1:28:12.333
Come here, Sapito!

1:28:12.500 --> 1:28:13.500
Come here!

1:28:14.042 --> 1:28:16.250
Come here, Sapito!
Come here!

1:28:16.417 --> 1:28:18.958
Bring your bayonet,
just you and me.

1:28:19.083 --> 1:28:20.083
Come on, you and me.

1:28:21.875 --> 1:28:23.667
How do you know I'm Sapito?

1:28:24.125 --> 1:28:28.750
Want me to tell them you cheated
on your wife with that whore?

1:28:29.542 --> 1:28:32.208
Sapito cheated on his wife!
You hear me?

1:28:32.375 --> 1:28:34.083
Sapito has a lover!

1:28:34.292 --> 1:28:35.375
Son of a bitch!

1:28:35.625 --> 1:28:37.833
Do they know you got syphilis?

1:28:37.958 --> 1:28:40.500
- Because you fucked her...
- Where did you hear that?

1:28:40.583 --> 1:28:43.250
- Sapito has syphilis!
- Shut the fuck up!

1:28:43.417 --> 1:28:44.708
What the fuck do you want?

1:28:45.792 --> 1:28:47.667
My potty and my<i> mate.</i>

1:28:47.958 --> 1:28:49.750
That my mom brought.

1:28:51.250 --> 1:28:53.917
And bring some hot water
for the<i> mate.</i>

1:28:54.042 --> 1:28:55.917
I don't like the water warm.

1:28:56.125 --> 1:28:59.208
- Maybe he has a periscope.
- He definitely has a periscope.

1:29:02.208 --> 1:29:04.458
Do you even know what a periscope is?

1:29:05.750 --> 1:29:07.875
What are you talking about, moron?

1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:11.875
We need to keep an eye
on this filthy bastard.

1:29:12.250 --> 1:29:14.292
We'll have to call our superiors.

1:29:45.917 --> 1:29:47.833
<i>So, tell me.</i>

1:29:48.208 --> 1:29:52.708
You have a device, an antenna.
Who put it there?

1:29:52.958 --> 1:29:54.833
How should I know, doctor?

1:29:55.125 --> 1:29:56.750
I imagine the army,

1:29:56.833 --> 1:29:58.208
the CIA, I don't know.

1:29:58.375 --> 1:29:59.625
What does it say?

1:30:00.250 --> 1:30:01.750
It's a voice here.

1:30:01.875 --> 1:30:03.333
It insults me.

1:30:03.458 --> 1:30:06.458
It wants to control my thoughts,
get information out of me...

1:30:06.583 --> 1:30:09.708
It sends me an electric pulse,

1:30:09.792 --> 1:30:14.958
it sends me heat here, in my ear...
A fire here burns me.

1:30:16.083 --> 1:30:18.125
Have you had any

1:30:18.500 --> 1:30:20.458
episodes of anxiety, distress,

1:30:20.625 --> 1:30:21.833
fear?

1:30:23.042 --> 1:30:25.083
Any stressful situations?

1:30:27.833 --> 1:30:30.083
Do you sleep well? Do you rest?

1:30:30.292 --> 1:30:32.125
Yeah, he rests.

1:30:33.750 --> 1:30:35.708
Do you eat right?

1:30:36.792 --> 1:30:37.875
More or less.

1:30:38.000 --> 1:30:39.833
He eats everything we give him.

1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:44.417
Soldier, I need to work calmly.

1:30:44.583 --> 1:30:48.500
So bring some water, please.

1:30:49.375 --> 1:30:50.750
Go and get some water.

1:31:08.917 --> 1:31:13.833
Mujica, all of these symptoms you have
appear to be...

1:31:14.875 --> 1:31:17.042
a delusional psychosis.

1:31:17.875 --> 1:31:20.958
We still don't know if it's chronic,
if it's acute...

1:31:21.125 --> 1:31:23.208
We need more time to evaluate.

1:31:23.375 --> 1:31:25.792
But that's what's making you feel...

1:31:27.083 --> 1:31:30.333
confused and unable to reason.

1:31:30.500 --> 1:31:33.542
Part of your disorder has to do with
not being able to rest.

1:31:33.708 --> 1:31:36.958
Right now what will help you
the most is sleeping at night.

1:31:37.083 --> 1:31:39.042
Take some pills and sleep.

1:31:39.750 --> 1:31:41.458
That's what I'm going to prescribe.

1:31:43.667 --> 1:31:46.000
I don't need to sleep, doctor.

1:31:48.083 --> 1:31:51.792
- You don't? And what do you need?
- To stop thinking.

1:31:54.083 --> 1:31:56.583
What will help you

1:31:56.708 --> 1:31:58.667
to stop thinking?

1:31:58.958 --> 1:32:00.292
To use my hands,

1:32:00.958 --> 1:32:02.708
to organize my head.

1:32:03.625 --> 1:32:04.833
To write,

1:32:05.458 --> 1:32:06.583
read...

1:32:08.250 --> 1:32:10.083
To read and write.

1:32:10.625 --> 1:32:13.958
I'll have them send you something
to read and paper

1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:15.292
and a pen to write with.

1:32:15.708 --> 1:32:17.708
I haven't read in 7 years.

1:32:17.875 --> 1:32:21.208
You have to cling to anything
you can right now, Mujica.

1:32:21.958 --> 1:32:24.708
Anything that you have at hand.

1:32:25.542 --> 1:32:27.750
Are you religious?
Do you believe in God?

1:32:28.292 --> 1:32:29.792
What god would do this?

1:32:31.375 --> 1:32:33.667
The only one we've got,
unfortunately.

1:32:33.833 --> 1:32:38.625
If the god you believe in remains silent,

1:32:38.958 --> 1:32:41.000
and you say I'm crazy,

1:32:43.208 --> 1:32:44.833
what do I cling to?

1:32:46.625 --> 1:32:50.458
You're the first
woman I've seen in years.

1:32:51.667 --> 1:32:55.833
I haven't seen the stars
or light for years.

1:32:57.083 --> 1:33:00.375
And you talk to me
about reason, what reason?

1:33:01.708 --> 1:33:04.417
Look, I'm going to tell you a story.

1:33:05.292 --> 1:33:07.208
When I was 15 years old,

1:33:07.875 --> 1:33:10.083
I saw my mother die of cancer.

1:33:10.958 --> 1:33:16.292
And that was when I decided
to become a doctor.

1:33:16.375 --> 1:33:18.583
So I studied and got my degree.

1:33:18.792 --> 1:33:23.583
I saw hundreds, thousands of patients
those 20 years.

1:33:23.750 --> 1:33:27.667
But one day I got up
and didn't want to come to work.

1:33:27.833 --> 1:33:30.625
I couldn't leave the house,
I couldn't get up.

1:33:30.708 --> 1:33:32.125
I didn't want to talk to anyone.

1:33:33.375 --> 1:33:36.083
And I thought and I thought
and I thought.

1:33:38.042 --> 1:33:39.250
Like you.

1:33:39.958 --> 1:33:41.958
Until I realized

1:33:43.708 --> 1:33:45.583
that no matter what I did,

1:33:46.208 --> 1:33:47.417
my mother

1:33:49.375 --> 1:33:50.750
would still be dead.

1:33:54.083 --> 1:33:57.125
That's when I got up
and went back to work.

1:33:58.000 --> 1:34:00.750
And here I am, doing what I can,

1:34:01.333 --> 1:34:04.250
asking you to do what you can.

1:34:04.833 --> 1:34:07.542
To cling to anything you can.

1:34:07.958 --> 1:34:09.542
Ma'am.

1:34:14.042 --> 1:34:15.792
All set? Can I take him?

1:34:15.958 --> 1:34:17.333
Yes.

1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:26.042
Soldier.

1:34:26.250 --> 1:34:28.542
I need him to sign the diagnosis.

1:34:31.958 --> 1:34:32.958
All right.

1:34:35.958 --> 1:34:39.250
I'll get you something
to read and write.

1:34:40.083 --> 1:34:41.333
Be strong.

1:34:41.833 --> 1:34:43.000
Survive.

1:34:43.208 --> 1:34:44.750
It's almost over.

1:34:46.875 --> 1:34:48.083
Come on, Mujica.

1:34:49.667 --> 1:34:52.375
<i>Yes, for my country.</i>

1:34:53.625 --> 1:34:56.583

<i>Yes, for progress</i>

1:35:00.667 --> 1:35:03.625

<i>Yes, for greatness.</i>

1:35:15.458 --> 1:35:18.750
<i>Yes, for Uruguay.</i>

<i>39 % "no," 61 % "yes."</i>

1:35:33.958 --> 1:35:35.292
<i>In Maldonado...</i>

1:35:35.875 --> 1:35:41.250
<i>Are we "yes" or "no"?</i>

1:35:44.708 --> 1:35:47.750
<i>I don't know.</i>

1:35:52.542 --> 1:35:54.458
Take this, little shit!

1:36:02.375 --> 1:36:04.875
It's a disgrace, a disgraceful defeat.

1:36:05.000 --> 1:36:07.792
- What will happen?
- Who knows?

1:36:09.792 --> 1:36:13.542
<i>Against all predictions,
with 80 % of all votes counted,</i>

1:36:13.708 --> 1:36:16.917

1:36:17.042 --> 1:36:19.542
